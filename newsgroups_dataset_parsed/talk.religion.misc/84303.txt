THE
PEACEFUL
ATTEMPT
TO
SERVE
THE

WAS
MET
WITH
GUNFIRE
DUE
PROCESS
WAS
NOT

BECAUSE
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
WANTED
IT
THAT
WAY
YOU
THINK
ON
THAT
DID
YOU
BY
ANY
CHANCE
SEE
THE
PICTURES
OF
THE
AGENTS
IN
FLAK
JACKETS
CLIMBING
UP
ON
THE
ROOF
AND
BREAKING

YOU
CALL
THAT
PEACEFUL

DETERMINE
YOUR

MAY
BE
WRONG
FROM
MY
POINT
OF
VIEW
BUT
THEY
ARE
YOURS
ALL
THE
SAME

MAKE
IT
MORE
PRACTICAL

DO
NOT
HAVE
THAT
RIGHT
IF
YOU
DID
NOT
YOU
WOULD
IGNORE
ME
YOU
CERTAINLY
WOULD
IT
YOU
SAW
ME
STICKING
THE
NEEDLE
IN
A
TREE
KORESH
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
MISGUIDED
ONLY
GOD
KNOWS
BUT
THE
JEWS
AT
MASADA
DIED
FOR
WHAT
THEY
BELIEVED
THE
THREE
HEBREWS
PREFERRED
TO
DIE
IN
THE
FURNACE
RATHER
THAN
BOW
DOWN
DANIEL
PREFERRED
TO
DIE
IN
A
LIONS
DEN
RATHER
THAN
STOP
PRAYING
TO
HIS
GOD
AND
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
I
AM
PREPARED
TO
DIE
FOR
MY
FAITH
KORESH
WAS
NOT
DYING
FOR
NOW
REASON
HE
HAD
A
CAUSE
WHY
SHOULD
HE
GIVE
UP
THE
CHILDREN
TO
FORCES
HE
WAS
CONVINCED
WERE
EVIL
THE
EVENTS
ARE
BIZARRE
BUT
THEY
MATCH
HIS
BELIEFS
