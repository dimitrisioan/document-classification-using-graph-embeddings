CULLED
FROM
A
DISCUSSION
ON
CHRISTIANITY
AND
OBJECTIVE
MORALS
QUESTION
IS
THERE
ANY
EFFECTIVE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
OBJECTIVE
VALUES
EXIST
AND
THERE
IS
DISAGREEMENT
OVER
WHAT
THEY
ARE
AND
VALUES
ARE
SUBJECTIVE
I
DONT
SEE
ANY
IS
THERE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
IN
SAYING
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
EXISTS
BUT
SOME
PEOPLE
THINK
ITS
A
LIE
AND
TRUTH
IS
RELATIVE
I
THINK
THERE
IS
IN
BOTH
EXAMPLES
THE
FIRST
STATEMENT
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN
AT
LEAST
TWO
PEOPLE
THE
SECOND
STATEMENT
IS
AGREED
UPON
BY
ALL
TO
PUT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
SOMEONE
WHO
SAYS
OBJECTIVE
VALUES
EXIST
DOES
NOT
AGREE
THAT
VALUES
ARE
SUBJECTIVE
