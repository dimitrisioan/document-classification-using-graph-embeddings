IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED
JASONSATLASTELECOM
JASON
SMITH
WRITES
BSKENDIGNETCOMCOM
BRIAN
KENDIG
WRITES
AND
I
FELT
TORN
WHEN
I
BEGAN
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
A
LOT
OF
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
AND
MY
PRIESTS
TOLD
ME
DID
IT
START
GETTING
A
LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE
DID
YOUR
STYLE
START
FEELING
A
BIT
CRAMPED
YES
THATS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
FELT
MY
HEART
JUST
FELT
THAT
WHAT
I
WAS
BEING
TAUGHT
WAS
WRONG
A
BASICALLY
GOOD
MESSAGE
BUT
FRAMED
IN
ERRORS
I
COULD
NOT
WITH
A
CLEAR
CONSCIENCE
ACCEPT
THAT
WOMEN
WERE
SOMEHOW
NOT
EQUAL
TO
MEN
THAT
HOMOSEXUALS
ARE
GUILTY
OF
THEIR
LIFESTYLE
THAT
PRIDE
IN
ONES
WORK
IS
A
BAD
THING
THAT
JESUS
DIED
FOR
ME
I
DONT
WANT
ANYBODY
TO
DIE
FOR
ME
ESPECIALLY
AS
AN
IMPERSONAL
ACT
WHERE
THE
PERSON
CANT
POSSIBLY
EVEN
KNOW
ME
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
REALLY
KNOW
IF
IM
WORTH
DYING
FOR
OR
NOT
I
WAS
NEVER
ABLE
TO
ACCEPT
THE
BIT
ABOUT
JESUSS
DEATH
BEING
A
GOOD
THING
IF
THAT
MEANS
THAT
IM
JUST
NOT
COMPREHENDING
A
BASIC
MESSAGE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THEN
SO
BE
IT
MAYBE
IM
JUST
NOT
COMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
JUST
REFUSE
TO
FOLLOW
RULES
BLINDLY
AND
SINCE
I
CANT
EVEN
CONVINCE
MYSELF
THAT
YOUR
GOD
EVEN
EXISTS
IN
THE
WAY
YOU
DESCRIBE
IT
IVE
GOT
TO
JUST
FOLLOW
MY
OWN
CONSCIENCE
IN
THESE
MATTERS
I
KNOW
HOW
THAT
GOES
KNOWING
I
COULDNT
AND
DIDNT
WANT
TO
LIVE
UP
TO
THOSE
IMPOSSIBLEAND
RATHER
INCOVENIENT
RULES
ARE
WHAT
KEPT
ME
OUTSIDE
TOO
DONT
THINK
THAT
MY
MORALS
ARE
SHODDY
OR
NONEXISTENT
JUST
BECAUSE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
YOUR
GOD
I
WILL
NOT
STEAL
AND
I
WILL
NOT
MURDER
NOT
BECAUSE
I
FEAR
DIVINE
REPUDIATION
BUT
BECAUSE
THESE
JUST
ARENT
IN
MY
CHARACTER
YOU
MAY
THINK
THERES
NOTHING
KEEPING
ME
FROM
JUST
RUNNING
AROUND
ON
A
MURDERING
SPREE
STEALING
THINGS
WHEN
IM
ABLE
INSULTING
PEOPLE
FOR
THE
HECK
OF
IT
BECAUSE
IM
NOT
ANSWERABLE
TO
ANYONE
BUT
YOUD
BE
WRONG
IM
ANSWERABLE
TO
MYSELF
A
LIFE
LIKE
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
CHEAP
LIFE
I
HAPPEN
TO
WANT
TO
EARN
RESPECT
IN
MYSELF
TILL
I
MET
THE
MAN
THAT
IS
MY
INITIAL
BREAK
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
CAME
AFTER
A
LOT
OF
SOULSEARCHING
AND
A
LOT
OF
WONDERING
WHY
I
COULD
NO
LONGER
FEEL
THE
PRESENCE
OF
GOD
WITH
ME
I
FINALLY
DECIDED
THAT
I
HAD
ONCE
FELT
THIS
PRESENCE
JUST
AS
I
HAD
FELT
MY
MIGHTY
TEDDY
BEAR
BESIDE
ME
WHEN
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
TYKE
PROTECTING
ME
FROM
THE
MONSTERS
UNDER
THE
BED
THAT
I
HAD
BELIEVED
IN
GOD
JUST
AS
I
HAD
BELIEVED
IN
THE
TEDDY
BEAR
AS
SOMETHING
OF
AN
EMOTIONAL
CRUTCH
TO
PROTECT
ME
FROM
PERCEIVED
DANGERS
SINCE
THEN
IVE
NEVER
ABANDONED
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
MAYBE
YOUR
SUPERNATURAL
TRINITY
DOES
EXIST
BUT
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
TIMES
WHEN
IN
MY
DARKENED
ROOM
BY
MY
BED
I
HAVE
SET
ASIDE
EVERYTHING
I
BELIEVE
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
CALLED
OUT
TO
WHATEVERS
OUT
THERE
BECAUSE
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
EVEN
IF
IT
MEANS
ABANDONING
EVERYTHING
I
KNOW
AND
I
HAVE
NOT
YET
RECEIVED
AN
ANSWER
ONLY
WHEN
I
TRULY
LISTENED
TO
MYSELF
BODY
AND
SOUL
DID
I
REALIZE
THAT
I
COULD
NO
LONGER
HONESTLY
KEEP
UP
THE
CHARADE
OF
BEING
CHRISTIAN
THERE
IS
A
HIGHER
TRUTH
IN
THE
UNIVERSE
AND
CHRISTIANITY
JUST
AINT
IT
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
ON
WHAT
OR
WHO
OR
WHERE
IT
MIGHT
BE
AND
WHY
NOPE
IT
MAY
WELL
BE
UNKNOWABLE
SCIENTISTS
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
UNIVERSE
MAY
BE
FINITE
AND
WRAP
AROUND
ON
ITSELF
THE
THREEDIMENSIONAL
UNIVERSE
MAY
BE
MAPPED
ONTO
A
FOURDIMENSIONAL
SUPERSPHERE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
YOU
CAN
MAP
A
TWODIMENSIONAL
PLANE
ONTO
A
THREEDIMENSIONAL
SPHERE
SEE
SPHERELAND
THE
SEQUEL
TO
FLATLAND
FOR
MORE
THOUGHTS
ON
THIS
OUR
ENTIRE
UNIVERSE
MIGHT
JUST
BE
AN
ELECTRON
IN
A
FOUR
DIMENSIONAL
UNIVERSE
WHICH
IN
TURN
MAY
ONLY
BE
AN
INSIGNIFICANT
SPECK
IN
A
UNIVERSE
ABOVE
THAT
AND
SO
ON
AND
SO
FORTH
UNTIL
THE
VARIABLES
BECOME
TOO
MUCH
FOR
US
TO
EVEN
SPECULATE
ON
THAT
IS
THERES
NO
POSSIBLE
WAY
FOR
US
TO
KNOW
EXACTLY
HOW
WE
CAME
TO
BE
SO
THERES
NO
REASON
AT
ALL
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
YOUR
GOD
EXISTS
NOR
HAD
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
OK
YOU
MAY
SAY
SO
NOW
IF
IM
JUST
BEING
GOOD
AM
I
DOING
GOOD
ENOUGH
THATS
FOR
YOU
TO
ANSWER
IF
YOU
FEEL
YOURE
DOING
FINE
THEN
GO
AHEAD
AND
IGNORE
US
FOOLISH
LITTLE
CHRISTIANS
WE
CAN
PRESENT
WHAT
WEVE
SEEN
AND
EXPERIENCED
PROVIDING
OUR
WITNESS
BUT
IT
ISNT
UP
TO
US
TO
MAKE
THAT
SEED
SPROUT
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
PROVIDED
ME
WITH
NOTHING
EXCEPT
QUOTES
FROM
YOUR
HOLY
BOOK
AND
ALL
SORTS
OF
TACTICS
TO
TRY
TO
GET
ME
TO
BELIEVE
GUILT
TRIPS
INSINUATIONS
THAT
IM
WITHOUT
MORALS
ARGUMENTS
FROM
DISBELIEF
HOW
CAN
YOU
POSSIBLY
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
DOESNT
EXIST
AND
SO
FORTH
ALL
IM
ASKING
IS
FOR
YOU
TO
CONVINCE
ME
I
WANT
TO
BE
CONVINCED
BUT
ITS
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
EASY
SO
MUCH
AS
YOU
DONT
LIKE
WHAT
WERE
SELLING
THERE
JUST
MAY
BE
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
THAT
CAN
IDENTIFY
WITH
IT
METHINKS
YOU
COULD
GIVE
US
ALL
A
LESSON
IN
TOLERANCE
AND
BACK
OFF
HAVING
HAD
YEARS
UPON
YEARS
OF
CONTACT
WITH
YOUR
RELIGION
FROM
BOTH
THE
INSIDE
AND
THE
OUTSIDE
I
VIEW
IT
AS
HARMFUL
IN
MANY
WAYS
IT
PREYS
ON
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
TO
FIND
MEANING
IN
THEIR
LIVES
AND
ONCE
ITS
GOT
THESE
PEOPLE
IT
TEACHES
THEM
TO
HAVE
PITY
AND
SOMETIMES
STARKLY
INTOLERANT
OF
OTHERS
WHO
DO
NOT
SHARE
THESE
VIEWS
MAYBE
YOULL
SAY
THAT
YOUR
RELIGION
DOESNT
TEACH
THAT
BUT
IVE
GOT
TO
JUDGE
CHRISTIANITY
FROM
THE
CHRISTIANS
I
KNOW
I
FEEL
THAT
IT
IS
ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE
AND
GOOD
TO
HAVE
FAITH
IN
ONES
SELF
AND
TO
BE
A
POSITIVE
INFLUENCE
ON
SOCIETY
FOR
NO
BETTER
REASON
THAN
THAT
SO
I
HOPE
THAT
MY
WORDS
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
WILL
AT
LEAST
MAKE
SOME
PEOPLE
THINK
I
WANT
CHRISTIANS
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THERE
ARE
PERFECTLY
VALID
LIFESTYLES
AND
OPINIONS
THAT
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THEIR
DEITY
WHATSOEVER
AND
I
WANT
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
CONSIDERING
CHRISTIANITY
TO
REALIZE
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
DOES
NOT
HOLD
THE
SOLE
KEY
TO
A
HAPPY
FULFILLED
LIFE
I
HAVE
KNOWN
SOME
VERY
NICE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
HAVE
DONE
SOME
VERY
NICE
THINGS
I
THINK
WHAT
SETS
THESE
PEOPLE
APART
FROM
THE
GENERAL
MASSES
IS
THAT
THEY
RECOGNIZE
THAT
THEIR
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
MAY
BE
WRONG
AND
THEY
KNOW
THE
WEAKNESSES
OF
THEIR
RELIGION
YET
THEY
STILL
DECIDE
TO
BELIEVE
BUT
THEY
KEEP
THEIR
BELIEFS
TO
THEMSELVES
AND
DO
NOT
THINK
ANY
LESS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
AGREE
WITH
THEM
OBVIOUSLY
THE
DEBATE
ON
THE
VERACITY
AND
RELIABILITY
OF
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
CHRISTIANS
FAITH
IS
FAR
FROM
CONCLUSIVE
NOTWITHSTANDING
HOW
VEHEMENTLY
WE
PROPOSE
OTHERWISE
PRECISELY
MY
POINT
YOUVE
STILL
NOT
GIVEN
ME
A
REASON
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
INSTEAD
OF
A
BUDDHIST
OR
A
MOSLEM
THE
NICE
THING
ABOUT
RELIGION
IF
YOU
LOSE
YOURSELF
DEEPLY
ENOUGH
IN
IT
IS
THAT
EVENTUALLY
YOULL
BE
ABLE
TO
FEEL
JUSTIFIED
IN
MOST
ANYTHING
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
YKNOW
YOUR
RIGHT
FORTUNATELY
FOR
EVERYONE
AROUND
ME
IM
NOT
RELIGIOUS
IM
A
CHRISTIAN
JUST
AS
THE
MOSLEMS
ARENT
RELIGIOUS
AND
THE
BUDDHISTS
ARENT
RELIGIOUS
WHO
IS
RELIGIOUS
