it
was
interesting
to
watch
the
club
today
pat
robertson
said
that
the
branch
dividians
had
met
the
firey
end
for
worshipping
their
false
god
he
also
said
that
this
was
a
terrible
tragedy
and
that
the
fbi
really
blew
it
i
dont
necessarily
agree
with
pat
robertson
every
one
will
be
placed
before
the
judgement
seat
eventually
and
judged
on
what
we
have
done
or
failed
to
do
on
this
earth
god
allows
people
to
choose
who
and
what
they
want
to
worship
im
sorry
but
he
does
not
ever
read
the
first
commandment
worship
of
money
is
one
of
the
greatest
religions
in
this
country
you
mean
false
religion
