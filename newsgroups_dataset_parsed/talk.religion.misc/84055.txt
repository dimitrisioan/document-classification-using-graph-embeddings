does
anyone
have
or
know
where
i
can
find
a
list
of
christianowned
corporations
and
companies
one
that
i
know
of
is
wordperfect
i
believe
that
wordperfect
is
actually
owned
by
the
mormons
sorry
wordperfect
is
own
by
a
mormon
not
the
lds
church
slight
semantical
difference
the
lds
church
does
own
a
heck
of
a
lot
however
they
are
the
largest
land
holder
in
missouri
where
they
think
christ
will
appear
at
the
second
coming
i
believe
they
also
own
some
large
beverage
company
like
pepsi
that
was
why
they
had
to
take
caffiene
off
of
their
forbidden
substance
