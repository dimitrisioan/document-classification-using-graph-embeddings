DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
OR
KNOW
WHERE
I
CAN
FIND
A
LIST
OF
CHRISTIANOWNED
CORPORATIONS
AND
COMPANIES
ONE
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
IS
WORDPERFECT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WORDPERFECT
IS
ACTUALLY
OWNED
BY
THE
MORMONS
SORRY
WORDPERFECT
IS
OWN
BY
A
MORMON
NOT
THE
LDS
CHURCH
SLIGHT
SEMANTICAL
DIFFERENCE
THE
LDS
CHURCH
DOES
OWN
A
HECK
OF
A

HOWEVER
THEY
ARE
THE
LARGEST

IN
MISSOURI
WHERE
THEY
THINK
CHRIST
WILL
APPEAR
AT
THE
SECOND
COMING
I
BELIEVE
THEY
ALSO
OWN
SOME
LARGE
BEVERAGE
COMPANY
LIKE
PEPSI
THAT
WAS
WHY
THEY
HAD
TO
TAKE
CAFFIENE
OFF
OF
THEIR
FORBIDDEN
