IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED
BRIANLPLARIZONAEDU
BRIAN
CECCARELLI
WRITES
THEY
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
KNOW
IT
OR
BE
EXPOSED
TO
LIGHT
BECAUSE
THEIR
OWN
EVIL
DEEDS
WILL
BE
UNCOVERED
AND
SO
BY
THEIR
OWN
CHOICE
THEY
WILL
REMAIN
IN
DARKNESS
SORT
OF
LIKE
BUGS
UNDER
A
ROCK
HOWEVER
SOME
PEOPLE
BUT
NOT
MANY
WILL
NOT
LIKE
THE
DARKNESS
SOMETIMES
IT
GETS
TOO
COLD
AND
TOO
DARK
TO
BE
COMFORTABLE
THESE
PEOPLE
WILL
CRAWL
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
ROCK
AND
ALTHOUGH
BLINDED
AT
FIRST
WILL
GET
ACCUSTOMED
TO
THE
LIGHT
AND
ENJOY
ITS
WARM
AND
AFTER
A
WHILE
BY
VIRTUE
OF
THE
LIGHT
THEY
WILL
SEE
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THEIR
OWN
SHORTCOMINGS
AND
HOW
TO
CORRECT
THEM
AND
ALSO
THEY
WILL
SEE
THAT
THERE
IS
MUCH
MUCH
MORE
TO
THIS
WORLD
THAN
JUST
THE
NARROW
LITTLE
EXPERIENCES
UNDER
THE
ROCK
THEY
WILL
DISCOVER
THAT
LIFE
UNDER
A
ROCK
WAS
INCREDIBLY
YUKKY
AND
THAT
LIFE
WITH
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
WORLD
IS
GREAT
SO
GREAT
THAT
THEY
WILL
WANT
TO
TELL
ALL
THEIR
FRIENDS
ABOUT
IT
AND
I
MAINTAIN
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
ENTER
INTO
THE
LIGHT
AND
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
THEY
ALONE
ARE
THEIR
OWN
MASTERS
BECAUSE
THEY
FEAR
IT
THEY
ARE
TOO
AFRAID
OF
HAVING
TO
FACE
THE
WORLD
ON
THEIR
OWN
TERMS
AND
SO
BY
THEIR
OWN
CHOICE
THEY
WILL
REMAIN
IN
DARKNESS
SORT
OF
LIKE
BUGS
UNDER
A
ROCK
HOWEVER
SOME
PEOPLE
BUT
NOT
MANY
WILL
NOT
LIKE
THE
DARKNESS
SOMETIMES
IT
GETS
TOO
COLD
AND
TOO
DARK
TO
BE

THESE
PEOPLE
WILL
CRAWL
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
ROCK
AND
ALTHOUGH
BLINDED
AT
FIRST
WILL
GET
ACCUSTOMED
TO
THE
LIGHT
AND
ENJOY
ITS
WARMTH
AND
AFTER
A
WHILE
NOW
THAT
THEY
CAN
SEE
THINGS
FOR
WHAT
THEY
REALLY
ARE
THEY
WILL
ALSO
SEE
THE
HEIGHTS
WHICH
THEY
CAN
REACH
AND
THE
PLACES
THEY
CAN
GO
AND
THEY
WILL
LEARN
TO
CHOOSE
THEIR
OWN
PATHS
THROUGH
THE
WORLD
AND
THEY
WILL
LEARN
FROM
THEIR
MISTAKES
AND
REVEL
IN
THEIR
SUCCESSES
THEY
WILL
SEE
THAT
THERE
IS
MUCH
MUCH
MORE
TO
THE
WORLD
THAN
JUST
THE
NARROW
EXPERIENCES
UNDER
THE
ROCK
THEY
WILL
DISCOVER
THAT
LIFE
UNDER
A
ROCK
WAS
INCREDIBLY
YUCKY
AND
THAT
LIFE
ON
THEIR
OWN
TERMS
IS
GREAT
SO
GREAT
THAT
THEY
WILL
WANT
TO
TELL
EVERYONE
ELSE
ABOUT
IT
DO
YOU
SEE
MY
POINT
I
THINK
YOURE
THE
ONE
UNDER
THE
ROCK
AND
IM
GETTING
A
GREAT
TAN
OUT
HERE
IN
THE
SUNLIGHT
MY
LIFE

IMPROVED
IMMESURABLY
SINCE
I

WILL
BE
A
DIFFICULT
TRIP
AT
FIRST
UNTIL
YOU
BUILD
UP
YOUR
MUSCLES
FOR
THE
LONG
HIKE
BUT
ITS
WELL
WORTH
IT
NOT
ALL
PEOPLE
HATE
LIGHT
KENT

HAVE
AN
ADVERSION
TO
IT
TO
SOME
EXTENT
BUT

BRIAN
K
ENJOYS
STATING
FALSE
CONCEPTS
AND
FALSE
PRESSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
THE
GOD
OF
THE
BIBLE
WITHOUT
CHECKING
HIS
OWN
PRESUMPTIONS
HE
COMPARES
MY
GOD
WITH
ODIN
OR
ZEUS
LOOK

JUST
PRACTICALLY
EQUATED
ODIN
AND
ZEUS
THEYRE
AS
MUCH
DIFFERENT
AS
YOUR
GOD
IS
FROM
THEM
DONT

NOT
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
ANYTHING
THAT
I
CANT
WITNESS
WITH
MY

SOMETHING
AS
MEGAPOWERFUL
AS
WHAT
YOURE
TRYING
TO
GET
ME

ACCEPT
SURELY
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
IT
THIS
STRONGLY
YOU
MUST
HAVE
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
DONT
YOU
WITHOUGH
CHECKING
HIS
OWN
PRESUMPTION
HE
THINKS
HELL
IS
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
NONEXISTENCE
WHEN
DID
I
SAY
THAT
I
SAY
THAT
I
WOULD
RATHER
CEASE
EXISTING
INSTEAD
OF
BEING
SUBJECT
TO
THE
WHIMS
OF
A
DEITY
BUT
THAT
IF
THE
DEITY
DECIDED
TO
TOSS
ME
INTO
THE
FIERY
PITS
BECAUSE
OF
WHO
I
AM
THEN
SO
BE
IT
DO

FOND
OF
THEIR
SEXUAL
SINS

HORDING
OF
MONEY
THEIR
SELFISHNESS
AND
NOT
TO
MENTION
THEIR
BIBLICAL
IGNORANCE
NOPE
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
CHRISTIAN
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
FOND
OF
FEELING
THAT
THEY
ARE
IMPERFECT
OF
BELIEVING
THAT
THE
WORLD
IS
AN
UNDESIRABLE
PLACE
OF
RECITING
MAGICAL
MYSTICAL
PRAYERS
TO
MAKE
THE
WORLD
NICE
AND
HOLY
AGAIN
OF
DOING
JUST
AS
THEIR
PRIESTS
TELL
THEM
LIKE
GOOD
LITTLE
SHEEP
YOU
ENJOY
DARKNESS
AND
YOURE
PROUD
OF
IT

HAVE
YOU
READ
ANY
OF
THE
KORAN
OR
ZEN
WRITINGS
OR
HARE
KRISHNA
LITERATURE
IF
YOU
HAVENT
THEN
HOW
CAN
YOU
SAY
YOU
HAVE
AN
OPEN
MIND
SIN
IS
FUN
LETS
ADMIT
IT
BUT
A
LIFE
OF
SIN
LEADS
TO
TROUBLE
AND
DEATH
IN
THIS
LIFE
AND
HELL
IN
THE
NEXT
NOPE
YOU
MAKE
DECISIONS
ENJOY
YOUR
SUCCESSES
AND
ACCEPT
YOUR
FAILURES
THEN
YOU
DIE
IF
YOU
ARE
CONTENT
WITH
THE
LIFE
YOUVE
LED
AS
YOU
REFLECT
BACK
ON
IT
IN
YOUR
FINAL
MOMENTS
THEN
YOUVE
LED
A
GOOD
LIFE

OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
ROCK

HE
GAVE
HIS
ONE
AND
ONLY
SON
THAT
WHOEVER
BELIEVES
IN
HIM
SHALL
NOT
PERISH
BUT
HAVE
ETERNAL
LIFE
IM
SORRY
I
DONT
FEEL
THAT
SACRIFICING
JESUS
WAS
SOMETHING
ANY
GOD
ID
WORSHIP
WOULD
DO
UNLESS
THE
SACRIFICE
WAS
ONLY
TEMPORARY
IN
WHICH
CASE
ITS
NOT
REALLY
ALL
THAT
IMPORTANT
FORGET
THE
BIBLE
FOR
A
MINUTE
FORGET
QUOTING
VERSES
FORGET
ABOUT
WHO

WHAT
ABOUT
THIS
OR
THAT
SHOW
