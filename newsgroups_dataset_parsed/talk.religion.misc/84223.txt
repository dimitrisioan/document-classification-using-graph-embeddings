LETS

MAKE
ABORTION
NECESSARY
WHY
NOT
THEY
ARE
CERTAINLY
LEGAL

COUNSELLING
THAT
ONLY
PROVIDES
ALTERNATIVES
TO

WOULD

JUST
AS

INFORMATION
HOW
ABOUT
PROVIDING
COUNSELLING
THAT
WILL
GIVE
A
WOMAN
HELP

WHAT
SHE
IS

WITH
YOUR
ADOPTIONFUNDING
IDEA
MAY
BE
A
GOOD
ONE
ANY
IDEA
IF
IT
IS
FEASABLE
THE
ONLY
WAY
HELL
IS
INVOLVED
IS
THAT
IT
IS
GOING
TO
BE
A
GOOD
SKIING
RESORT
BEFORE
I
GIVE
IN
TO
PAYING
FOR
ABORTIONS
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
WRONG
AND
I
WONT
PAY
FOR
IT
WITHOUT
A
GRIPE
IM
NOT
FOR
MAKING
THEM
UNLAWFUL
ID
RATHER
SPEND
MONEY
ON
SAVING
LIVES
THAN
A
BUNCH
OF

AND
COURT
HEARINGS
AND
ALL
THIS
OTHER
CRAP
WE
ARE
SPENDING
OUR
TIME
ON
YOU
KNOW
WHOS
REALLY
CLEANING
UP
ON
ALL
THIS
ABORTION
STUFF
LAWYERS
I
SAY
LETS
PASS
LAWS
TO
MAKE
ADOPTION
CHEAPER
EASIER
AND
INFINITELY
MORE
SUPPORTIVE
OF
THE
BIRTH
MOTHER
LETS
ERADICATE
THE
STIGMA
REDUCE
THE
COST
PAY
THE
PRICE
FOR
LIFE
MAKING
ADOPTION
EASIER
ON
THE
BIRTHMOTHER
MAY
HELP
REDUCE
ABORTION
BUT
IT
WILL
NOT
ELIMINATE
THE
NEED
FOR
IT
ABORTION
IS
NOT
DONE
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
MOTHER
CANT
CARE
FOR
THE
CHILD
AND
DOESNT
FEEL
GOOD
ABOUT
GIVING
IT
TO
STRANGERS
ABORTION
IS
DONE
BECAUSE
THE
MOTHER
CAN
NOT
AFFORD
THE
PREGNANCY
SOAPBOX
OFF
A
PERSON
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
DO
ANYTHING
THAT
DOES
NOT
INTERFERE
WITH
THE
RIGHTS
OF
ANOTHER
PERSON
COOL
ENOUGH
YOULL
HAVE
MORE
TROUBLE
DEFINING
THE
TERMS
IN
THAT
STATEMENT
THAN
GETTING
PEOPLE
TO
AGREE
TO
IT
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
PERCEIVE
I
HAVE
A
RIGHT
NOT
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
WHAT
I
FEEL
IS
MURDER
I
DONT
THINK
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
EITHER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
SINCE
WE
ARE
HAVING
TROUBLE
PROVING
THAT
IT
IS
MURDER
THERE
IS
NO
RIGHT
TO
STOP
SOMEONE
FROM
DOING
IT
IF
THEY
SO
CHOOSE
EITHER
BY
LEGAL
MEANS
OR
HARASSMENT
OF
COURSE
PERSUASION
IS
ALLOWED
BUT
WATCH
THAT
LINE
BETWEEN
PERSUASIVE
AND
HARASSING
THE
SECOND
PART
IS
A
DEFINITION
OF
A
PERSON
A
SIMPLISTIC
EXPLANATION
IS
THAT
A
PERSON
IS
A
MEMBER
OF
SOCIETY
MOST
NORMAL
ADULT
HUMAN
BEINGS
ARE
GOOD
EXAMPLES
OF
PEOPLE
MOST
CHILDREN
OVER
TWO
YEARS
OLD
ARE
PEOPLE
AS
WELL
THE
SIMPLE
WAY
OF
DETERMINING
THIS
IS
THAT
YOU
CAN
HAVE
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
THEM
IT
IS
ACTUALLY
MORE
COMPLICATED
THAN
THAT
BUT
I
HAVE
NO
DESIRE
TO
SPEND
THE
TIME
IT
WOULD
TAKE
TO
EXPLAIN
IT
TO
YOU
READ
THE
THREAD
WHY
IS
BODILY
AUTONOMY
SO
IMPORTANT
FOR
MORE
EXPLANATION
AND
JUSTIFICATION
BUT
WHY
IS
YOUR
DEFINITION
AUTHORITATIVE
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
WHOE
US
SURELY
YOU
CAN
UNDERSTAND
THERE
ARE
OTHER
DEFINITIONS
WITH
EQUAL
RIGHT
OF
CONSIDERATION
THEN
PLEASE
JUSTIFY
WHY
BEING
HUMAN
AUTOMATICALLY
MAKES
SOMETHING
VALUABLE
AND
WHY
THAT
INCLUDES
THE
UNBORN
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
REFUSED
TO
FUN
ABORTIONS
DUE
TO
THE
QUALMS
OF
A
MINORITY
OF
THE
POPULATION
THEN
IT
WOULD
THEN
HAVE
TO
PAY
FAR
MORE
IN
THE
DELIVERY
OF
BABIES
WHOSE
MOTHERS
WANTED
AN
ABORTION
BUT
COULD
NOT
AFFORD
ONE
AND
NOW
THAT
BABY
WILL
ALSO
REQUIRE
CARE
FOR
YEARS
TRUE
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
FIXED
IT
IS
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IF
CLINTON
HAS
A
MEDICAL
PROGRAM
TO
GET
UNDERWAY
LET
HIM
ADDRESS
THIS
TOO
IT
IS
CHEAPER
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
TO
SAVE
LIVES
LATER
THEY
WILL
BE
PRODUCTIVE
MEMBERS
OF
SOCIETY
AT
LEAST
IF
HIS
PLAN
WORKS
NO
THEY
ARE
NOT
GUARANTEED
TO
BECOME
PRODUCTIVE
MEMBERS
OF
SOCIETY
EVEN
IF
THEY
DO
THAT
IS
MANY
YEARS
IN
THE
FUTUREUNTIL
WHICH
THEY
ARE
A
BURDEN
ON
SOMEONE
OR
SOCIETY
THERE
IS
ALSO
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
MOTHER
FORCING
HER
TO
CARRY
A
PREGNANCY
TO
TERM
AT
A
CRITICAL
TIME
IN
HER
LIFE
COULD
PREVENT
HER
FROM
BEING
A
PRODUCTIVE
MEMBER
OF
SOCIETY
ACTUALLY
I
WAS
REFERING
TO
THE
MINORITY
THAT
OBJECTS
TO
ABORTION
NOT
THOSE
WHO
OBJECT
TO
FEDERAL
FUNDING
I
ADMIT
I
DID
NOT
SAY
IT
VERY
CLEARLY
AND
APOLOGIZE
FOR
THAT
TO
REFUSE
TO
FUND
ABORTIONS
IS
TO
REMOVE
THAT
CHOICE
FROM
SOME
WOMEN
AND
ADD
THE
ADDITIONAL
BURDEN
TO
SOCIETY
FOR
NO
REASON
NO
THIS
IS
REALLY
FLAWED
LOGIC
IT
WOULD
BE
LIKE
ME
SAYING
I
WAS
BORN
WITH
A
DISFIGURED
FACE
AND
I
WANT
COSMETIC
REPAIR
IT
IS
DISCRIMINATORY
THAT
I
CANNOT
MAKE
THAT
CHOICE
AND
SO
YOU
MUST
PAY
FOR
IT
THAT
A
PERSON
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
MAKE
A
CHOICE
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
LEGALLY
OR
OTHERWISE
THAT
SOMEONE
ELSE
SHOULD
FOOT
THE
BILL
SIC
FOR
THAT
CHOICE
OK
LOOK
ITS
LIKE
THIS
WE
ARE
FOOTING
THE
BILL
MAYBE
THEY
WILL
TAKE
CHOICE
A
MAYBE
THEY
WILL
TAKE
CHOICE
B
MAYBE
THEY
WILL
TAKE
CHOICE
C
THEY
CANT
AFFORD
ANY
ONE
OF
THEM
IF
THEY
TAKE
CHOICE
A
WED
HAVE
TO
PAY
THEM
SAY
IF
THEY
TAKE
CHOICE
B
IT
WOULD
COST
US
IF
THEY
TAKE
CHOICE
C
IT
WILL
COST
US
NOW
AND
A
HELL
OF
A
LOT
MORE
FOR
THE
NEXT
YEARS
WHICH
ONE
SOUNDS
THE
MOST
REALISTIC
FOR
US
TO
BE
WILLING
TO
PAY
FOR
NOW
SOME
PEOPLE
HAPPEN
NOT
TO
LIKE
CHOICE
A
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAPPEN
NOT
TO
LIKE
CHOICE
C
PAYING
FOR
IT
THAT
IS
C
HAS
BEEN
AROUND
AND
PAID
FOR
FOR
YEARS
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
MEANS
WE
SPEND
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
WE
CANT
IN
CONSCIENCE
REFUSE
TO
PAY
FOR
IT
NOW
A
HAS
BEEN
AROUND
AND
IS
PERFECTLY
LEGAL
BUT
IT
HASNT
BEEN
FUNDED
IN
THE
PAST
NOW
A
IS
GOING
TO
BE
FUNDED
BUT
SOME
PEOPLE
OBJECT
THEY
DONT
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
THEIR
TAX
MONEY
GOING
TO
PAY
FOR
CHOICE
A
SO
WE
COULD
REFUSE
TO
FUND
A
AT
ALL
THEN
THOSE
WOMEN
WHO
CANT
AFFORD
ANY
OF
THOSE
CHOICES
WILL
BE
FORCED
TO
TAKE
CHOICE
B
OR
C
WHICH
WILL
COST
ALL
OF
US
MORE
MONEY
MOST
OF
US
DONT
SEE
ANY
REASON
AT
ALL
WHY
MORE
MONEY
SHOULD
BE
SPENT
TO
THE
EFFECT
OF
REMOVING
PERSONAL
CHOICE
FROM
SOME
WOMEN
THE
ALTERNATIVE
IS
TO
FUND
A
IF
THAT
IS
WHAT
THE
MOTHER
CHOOSES
WE
WILL
ALSO
STILL
FUND
B
AND
EVEN
C
IF
THAT
IS
WHAT
THE
MOTHER
CHOOSES
HOWEVER
SOME
WOMEN
WILL
CERTAINLY
CHOOSE
A
AND
THAT
WILL
THEN
SAVE
US
WE
OTHERWISE
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
SPEND
YOUR
TAXES
ARE
NOT
BEING
RAISED
TO
FUND
A
CHOICE
YOU
OBJECT
THEY
ARE
BEING
LOWERED
BECAUSE
WE
WILL
FUND
A
CHOICE
THAT
IS
LEGAL
DESPITE
YOUR
OBJECTIONS
TO
IT
ACTUALLY
YOUR
TAXES
ARE
NOT
REALLY
GOING
TO
GO
DOWN
AS
IM
SURE
YOU
WOULD
POINT
OUT
BUT
THE
AMOUNT
THAT
IS
SAVED
IN
THAT
AREA
CAN
HELP
OUT
IN
ANOTHERLIKE
OUR
MASSIVE
DEBT
IF
YOU
DISAGREE
THEN
GIVE
US
SOME
REASONS
GIVEN
THAT
ABORTION
IS
LEGAL
AND
THE
RIGHT
TO
ABORTION
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
POPULATION
IT
IS
NOT
JUSTIFIABLE
TO
REFUSE
ABORTIONS
TO
WOMEN
WHO
CAN
NOT
AFFORD
THEM
WHO
WILL
SIMPLY
REQUIRE
EVEN
GREATER
FUNDS
FOR
THE
DELIVERY
YOU
WOULD
FORCE
UPON
THEM
I
REFUSE
TO
PAY
MORE
TAXES
TO
REMOVE
CHOICE
FROM
THOSE
WOMEN
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
OBJECT
TO
A
LEGAL
MEDICAL
PROCEDURE
WHAT
I
SAY
OBJECTION
TO
THE
PROCEDURE
IS
IRRELEVANT
UNCLE
BILL
DOESNT
PAY
FOR
BREAST
AUGMENTATION
FACELIFTS
ETC
WHY
ABORTIONS
ITS
ELECTIVE
SURGERY
THOSE
OTHER
PROCEDURES
YOU
MENTION
ONLY
COST
MONEY
THERE
IS
NO
SAVINGS
IN
OTHER
PROCEDURES
THAT
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
DOWN
THE
ROAD
WITHOUT
THEM
IN
FACT
THERE
COULD
BE
ADDITIONAL
COSTS
DOWN
THE
ROAD
BECAUSE
OF
THEM
THIS
IS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
CASE
OF
ABORTION
AS
FOR
YOUR
ARGUMENT
YOU
ARE
ENTICING
A
YOUNG
GIRL
TO
KILL
A
BABY
BY
MAKING
IT
AFFORDABLE
AND
REFUSING
TO
MAKE
THE
ALTERNATIVE
AFFORDABLE
TOO
SO
YOU
ARE
JUST
AS
GUILTY
OF
REMOVING
A
CHOICE
BY
WITHHOLDING
FUNDS
THINK
ABOUT
IT
A
POOR
GIRL
IS
PREGNANT
AND
ABORTIONS
ARE
FEDERALLY
FUNDED
WHATS
SHE
GONNA
DO
WHAT
CHOICE
HAVE
YOUR
PLANS
GIVEN
HER
YOUR
KIND
OF
DOUBLE
TALK
REALLY
MAKES
ME
ILL
THIS
IS
BULLSHIT
WE
ARE
NOT
REFUSING
TO
MAKE
THE
ALTERNATIVE
AFFORDABLE
TOO
IF
WE
REFUSED
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
MORE
EXPENSIVE
CHOICE
OF
BIRTH
THEN
YOUR
STATEMENT
WOULD
MAKE
SENSE
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
SO
IT
DOESNT
IF
CLINTON
TRIED
TO
BLOCK
FUNDING
FOR
PRENATAL
CARE
AND
DELIVERY
OR
LEFT
IT
OUT
OF
HIS
HEALTHCARE
PLAN
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
OBJECT
I
WOULD
ALSO
BE
QUITE
SURPRISED
PROCHOICE
HA
PROABORTION
REALLY
FITS
IN
YOUR
CASE
YES
BUT
PROBABLY
NOT
YOUR
DEFINITION
OF
IT
OR
FOR
THE
REASONS
YOU
THINK
IF
YOURE
GONNA
FUND
ONE
CHOICE
YOU
HAVE
TO
FUND
THEM
ALL
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
YOU
STUPID
FUCK
WE
DO
WANT
TO
FUND
ALL
THE
CHOICES
YOU
ARE
THE
ONE
WHO
WANTS
TO
NOT
FUND
ALL
THE
CHOICES
IMHO
IF
WE
FUND
THE
ADOPTION
CHOICE
RIGHT
MEANING
NOT
JUST
THROWING
MONEY
AT
IT
BUT
CUTTING
COSTS
ESP
LEGAL
COSTS
WE
WONT
NEED
ABORTION
ANYMORE
YOUR
HUMBLE
OPINION
IS
STILL
WRONG
EVEN
WITH
EASY
ADOPTION
THERE
IS
STILL
THE
FACT
THAT
PREGNANCY
TAKES
SEVERAL
MONTHS
MONTHS
IN
WHICH
A
YOUNG
WOMAN
COULD
NEED
TO
BE
GETTING
AN
EDUCATION
LIKE
FINISHING
HIGH
SCHOOL
ENTERING
COLLEGE
FINISHING
COLLEGE
GETTING
A
JOBTHINGS
THAT
ARE
MUCH
HARDER
TO
DO
IF
YOU
HAVE
TO
TAKE
A
BREAK
FOR
A
FEW
MONTHSTHINGS
THAT
HAVE
A
MASSIVE
IMPACT
ON
HER
FUTURE
PRODUCTIVITY
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
LIFE
A
FETUS
IS
NOT
A
PERSON
YOU
CAN
NOT
HAVE
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
THEM
AH
LETS
KILL
THE
MENTALLY
INCOMPETANT
AS
WELL
OR
HOW
ABOUT
PEOPLE
WE
JUST
DONT
LIKE
SINCE
WE
CANT
HAVE
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
THEM
YOU
CAN
HAVE
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
THE
MENTALLY
INCOMPETANT
AND
EVEN
THOUGH
YOU
PERSONALLY
MAY
REFUSE
TO
HAVE
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
PEOPLE
YOU
JUST
DONT
LIKE
IT
IS
STILL
POSSIBLE
FOR
OTHERS
TO
HAVE
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
THEM
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
ANYONE
TO
HAVE
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
A
FETUS
THEY
ARE
NOT
BIOLOGICALLY
INDEPENDENT
NOR
WAS
MY
SON
AT
THE
AGE
OF
WEEKS
HE
WAS
BREASTFED
AND
WOULD
NOT
TAKE
A
BOTTLE
JUST
WHAT
DOES
BIOLOGICALLY
INDEPENDENT
MEAN
ILL
BE
HAPPY
TO
PUNCH
ANY
DEFINITION
FULL
OF
LOOPHOLES
HE
WAS
STILL
BIOLOGICALLY
INDEPENDENT
AT
LEAST
TO
THE
SAME
EXTENT
YOU
ARE
NOW
HE
CONSUMED
NUTRIENTS
AND
DIGESTED
THEM
IN
THE
NORMAL
MANNER
HE
BREATHED
HIS
OWN
AIR
A
FETUS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
GETS
ITS
NUTRIENTS
ALREADY
DIGESTED
BY
THE
MOTHER
IT
GETS
ITS
OXYGEN
FROM
THE
MOTHER
AS
WELL
THAT
IS
NOT
BIOLOGICALLY
INDEPENDENT
THEIR
AWARENESS
IS
QUESTIONABLE
AHA
YOU
ADMIT
IT
IS
QUESTIONABLE
YET
YOU
ARE
WILLING
TO
KILL
IT
EVEN
IF
IT
MAY
BE
VERY
AWARE
I
SUGGEST
YOU
RETHINK
YOUR
VIEWPOINT
AWARENESS
IS
ONLY
PART
OF
WHAT
MAKES
A
MEMBER
OF
SOCIETY
IT
IS
THE
MINIMAL
CONCEIVABLE
REQUIREMENT
YET
MANY
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
THINK
THAT
SOMETHING
WITHOUT
AWARENESS
COULD
STILL
BE
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
JUSTIFY
THE
SUFFEREING
OF
A
TRUE
MEMBER
OF
SOCIETY
I
KEEP
ASKING
BUT
I
STILL
HAVENT
SEEN
A
REAL
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
WHY
THE
LIFE
OF
A
NONSENTIENT
CREATURE
SHOULD
BE
WORTH
THE
SUFFERING
OF
A
SENTIENT
BEING
I
HAVENT
READ
EVERY
RESPONSE
ON
THE
THREADS
IVE
BEEN
ASKING
ON
YET
SO
WELL
SEE
IF
I
SEE
ONE
LATER
THEY
HAVE
NO
EXPERIENCES
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
TO
MAKE
UP
A
PERSONALITY
THIS
IS
ALSO
TRUE
OF
QUITE
A
FEW
UNIX
PROGRAMMERS
SO
WHAT
D
ANYONE
WHO
CAN
PROGRAM
IN
UNIX
HAS
A
LOT
OF
EXPERIENCES
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
