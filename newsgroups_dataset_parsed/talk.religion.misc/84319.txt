i
assume
you
have
evidence
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
only
my
common
sense
the
fire
was
caused
by
either
koresh
and
his
followers
or
by
the
fbiatfciakgband
maybe
the
harper
valley
pta
since
you
are
throwing
around
the
evidence
arguement
ill
throw
it
back
can
you
prove
any
government
agency
did
it
please
dont
resort
to
they
covered
it
up
so
that
proves
they
did
it
or
any
wild
theories
about
how
the
government
agencies
intentionally
started
the
fire
the
key
words
are
proof
and
evidence
proves
they
did
it
no
which
is
why
i
want
an
investigation
please
explain
how
koresh
was
defending
himself
from
those
children
who
burned
who
ever
said
he
was
what
is
obvious
is
that
he
was
defending
himself
and
his
followers
from
the
government
whether
you
think
he
was
right
or
wrong
in
this
is
another
question
if
he
was
right
then
he
had
the
moral
right
to
kill
those
kgbatf
agents
ray
cote
theres
no
government
like
no
government
