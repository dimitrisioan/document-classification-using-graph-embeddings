I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
JUST
NOW
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
KNOWS
ABOUT
THE
WORD
COMPASSION
CHRISTIANS
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
ACTIONS
TODAY
WOULD
PRODUCE
A
GOOD
PICTURE
OF
YOUR
RELIGION
CLEARLY
ALL
PEOPLE
CONSIDERING
THEMSELVES
CHRISTIANS
ARE
ALL
ALIKE
AND
SUPPORT
ONE
ANOTHER
IN
EVERYTHING
THEY
DO
IN
PARTICULAR
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
THEY
CERTAINLY
WILL
SUPPORT
ALL
THE
ACTIONS
OF
ANY
OTHER
PERSON
CALLING
HIMSELF
A
CHRISTIAN
NOT
I
SEE
THERE
ARE
CHRISTIANS
AND
THERE
ARE
CHRISTIANS
NO
WONDER
THE
CHRISTIAN
WORLD
IS
IN
SHAMBLES
YOU
CANT
EVEN
AGREE
WHO
IS
A
RIGHTFUL
ONE
AND
A
WRONG
ONE
IF
ONE
DOES
NOT
FOLLOW
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
CHRIST
HE
IS
NOT
CHRISTIAN
TOO
EASY
PLEASE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
YOUR
COMMENTS
ABOUT
A
SUPPOSED
CHRISTIAN
LEADER
THAT
MAKES
SURE
THAT
CHILDREN
ARE
BURNT
TO
DEATH
WOULD
YOU
SAY
ALL
MUSLIMS
ARE
LIKE
SADDAM
HUSSEIN
I
WOULDNT
MAKE
SUCH
A
BLANKET
JUDGEMENT
