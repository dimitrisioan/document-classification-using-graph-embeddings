QUESTION
FOR
THOSE
WITH
POPULAR
MORALITY

DAVID
BOLD
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
JAMES
OWENS
WRITES
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
SAYING
THAT
GOD
BEING
UNKNOWABLE
HIS
MORALITY
IS
UNKNOWABLE
YEP
THATS
PRETTY
MUCH
IT
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
THE
SADDUCEES
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
TORAH
WAS
ALL
THAT
WAS
REQUIRED
WHEREAS
THE
PHARISEES
THE
ANCESTORS
OF
MODERN
JUDAISM
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
TORAH
WAS
AVAILABLE
FOR
INTERPRETATION
TO
LEAD
TO
AN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
REQUIRED
MORALITY
IN
ALL
ITS
NUANCES
TALMUD
THE
ESSENCE
OF
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
BIBLICAL
MORALITY
IS
AN
INTERFACE
BETWEEN
MAN
AND
YHWH
FOR
A
JEW
OR
CHRISTIAN
AND
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
INDICATE
ANYTHING
ABOUT
YHWH
OUTSIDE
OF
THAT
RELATIONSHIP
ALTHOUGH
ONE
CAN
SPECULATE
THE
POINT
IM
TRYING
TO
MAKE
IS
THAT
WE
ONLY
REALLY
HAVE
THE
BIBLE
TO
INTERPRET
AND
THAT
INTERPRETATION
IS
BY
HUMANITY
I
GUESS
THIS
IS
WHERE
FAITH
OR
RELEVATION
COMES
IN
WITH
ALL
ITS
INHERENT
SUBJECTIVENESS
GOD
BEING
UNKNOWABLE
I
CANT
COMMENT
ON
HIS
MOTIVES
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
DISTRESSING
IF
HE
ALLOWED
US
TO
MISUNDERSTAND
HIM
THROUGH
NO
FAULT
OF
OUR
OWN
FOR
SANITYS
SAKE
WE
MUST
ASSUME
IF
WE
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
AT
ALL
THAT
HIS
MESSAGE
COMES
THROUGH
SOMEHOW
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
IT
COMES
THROUGH
IMMEDIATELY
TO
EVERY
INDIVIDUAL
OR
IS
CONTAINED
IN
A
COMPLEX
CANON
THAT
MUST
BE
INTERPRETED
BY
EXPERTS
IN
CONSULTATION
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
OR
IS
TRANSMITTED
DIRECTLY
THROUGH
APPOINTED
REPRESENTATIVES
WHO
ARE
FREE
TO
INTERPRET
EXTEND
AND
MODIFY
THE
CANON
IF
GODS
MESSAGE
IS
INDEED
MEDIATED
THE
FURTHER
PROBLEM
ARISES
AS
TO
WHETHER
THE
INDIVIDUAL
UNDER
STANDS
THE
MEDIATED
MESSAGE
FULLY
AND
CLEARLY
SINCE
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
UNDERSTANDING
LIES
ULTIMATELY
WITH
THE
INDIVIDUAL
WE
MUST
ASSUME
THAT
GOD
IN
HIS
BENEVOLENCE
GUIDES
EACH
INDIVIDUAL
TO
THE
APPROPRIATE
SOURCE
FOR
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
WHEREOF
THE
PERSON
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
DRINK
METAPHYSICALLY
IF
THERE
ARE
MULTIPLE
MORAL
CODES
THEN
THERE
IS
NO
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
CODE
AND
I
THINK
THIS
IS
THEOLOGICALLY
QUESTIONABLE
NO
THERE
MAY
BE
AN
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
CODE
THERE
ARE
UNDOUBTABLY
MULTIPLE
MORAL
CODES
THE
MULTIPLE
MORAL
CODES
MAY
BE
FOUNDED
IN
THE
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
CODE
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
A
PARENT
MAY
TELL
A
CHILD
NEVER
TO
SWEAR
AND
THE
CHILD
MAY
ASSUME
THAT
THE
PARENT
NEVER
SWEARS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
PARENT
HAS
TOLD
THE
CHILD
THAT
IT
IS
WRONG
NOW
THE
PARENT
MAY
SWEAR
LIKE
A
TROOPER
IN
THE
PUB
OR
BAR
WHERE
THERE
ARE
NO
CHILDREN
THE
WRONGNESS
HERE
IS
IF
THE
CHILD
DISOBEYS
THE
PARENT
THE
PARENT
MAY
FEEL
THAT
IT
IS
INAPPROPRIATE
TO
SWEAR
IN
FRONT
OF
CHILDREN
BUT
MAY
BE
QUITE
HAPPY
TO
SWEAR
IN
FRONT
OF
ANIMALS
THE
ANALOGY
DOES
NOT
QUITE
HOLD
WATER
BECAUSE
THE
CHILD
KNOWS
THAT
HE
IS
OF
THE
SAME
TYPE
AS
THE
PARENT
AND
MAY
BE
A
PARENT
LATER
IN
LIFE
BUT
YOU
GET
THE
GIST
OF
IT
INCIDENTALLY
THE
YOUNG
CHILD
CONSIDERS
THE
DIRECTIVE
AS
ABSOLUTE
UNTIL
HE
GETS
OLDER
SEE
PIAGET
AND
LEARNS
A
MORALITY
OF
HIS
OWN
YOUR
EXAMPLE
IS
COMPLICATED
IN
OUR
AGE
BY
THE
THIN
LINE
BETWEEN
MORALITY
AND
POLITENESS
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
SAID
BURP
FOR
BURPING
AND
SWEARING
CARRY
ABOUT
THE
SAME
STIGMA
TODAY
IF
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
TAKING
THE
LORDS
NAME
IN
VAIN
AS
A
SERIOUS
TRANSGRESSION
THEN
THIS
EXAMPLE
IS
MORE
A
CASE
OF
HYPOCRISY
THAN
OF
VARYING
MORAL
CODES
IF
THERE
IS
AN
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
CODE
PROPOSITIONS
OR
LAWS
IN
THAT
CODE
APPLY
ABSOLUTELY
AND
UNIVERSALLY
BY
DEFINITION
CONCEIVABLY
SOME
MORAL
CODES
COULD
BE
SUBSETS
OF
THE
UNIVERSAL
CODE
AS
YOU
SAY
AT
THE
OUTSET
SO
FOR
EXAMPLE
GODS
CODE
COULD
INCLUDE
THOU
SHALT
NOT
CREATE
BEINGS
WITHOUT
A
HOSPITABLE
PLANET
TO
LIVE
ON
BUT
THIS
LAW
WOULD
BE
INAPPLICABLE
TO
US
NEVERTHELESS
WE
WOULD
BE
ENTITLED
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
ALL
LAWS
APPLICABLE
TO
US
ARE
ALSO
APPLICABLE
TO
GOD
BUT
WHEN
YOU
BEGIN
TO
ASK
WHAT
LAWS
MIGHT
APPEAR
IN
GODS
MORAL
CODE
YOU
HAVE
A
SENSE
OF
THE
ABSURDITY
OF
THE
QUESTION
DOES
GOD
MAKE
LAWS
FOR
HIMSELF
TO
FOLLOW
PERHAPS
GOD
IS
NOT
THE
SORT
OF
BEING
TO
WHICH
THE
CATEGORY
MORALITY
CAN
BE
SENSIBLY
APPLIED
