they
are
considered
different
and
largely
unrelated
by
a
number
of
sources
ive
seen
documentation
which
links
them
through
the
figure
of
h
spencer
lewis
lewis
was
apparently
involved
with
reuss
who
was
the
oho
of
ordo
templi
orientis
for
many
years
apparently
it
is
also
true
that
lewis
had
a
charter
to
form
an
oto
body
and
then
created
amorc
as
a
subsidiary
an
interesting
question
if
anyone
is
interested
in
the
history
of
amorc
i
do
think
spencer
lewis
published
books
about
the
beginning
and
his
mission
the
alexandria
bookstore
thats
the
name
of
the
book
store
operated
by
amorc
should
have
a
selection
that
should
provide
the
interested
reader
more
insight
