RE
WHAT
PART
OF
NO
DONT
YOU
UNDERSTAND
IN
E
ELIZABETH
BARTLEY
WRITES
I
CAN
CERTAINLY
SEE
OPPOSING
THE
AMEN
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
REQUIRE
OPPOSING
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
I
ALREADY
RESPONDED
TO
THIS
ON
ONE
DIMENSION
BUT
AFTERTHOUGHTS
CAUSE
ME
TO
MAKE
ANOTHER
INDEPENDENT
REPLY
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
IS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
AN
EVENHANDED
WAY
OF
ALLOWING
FOR
RELIGION
AMONGST
STUDENTS
IN
THE
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
AS
I
NOTED
BEFORE
MUSLIMS
NEED
MORE
THAN
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
IN
ORDER
TO
PERFORM
THE
PRAYERS
THEY
ARE
REQUIRED
BY
MUHAMMAD
TO
DO
AND
AT
LEAST
ORTHODOX
JEWISH
PRAYER
ALSO
HAS
REQUIREMENTS
THAT
ARE
NOT
ADDRESSED
BY
THIS
THERE
IS
IN
FACT
A
HIGHLY
SELECTIVE
BIAS
TOWARDS
CHRISTIAN
PRAYER
IN
THIS
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
SHIT
AND
THAT
IS
ESPECIALLY
BIZARRE
IN
THAT
CHRISTIAN
PRAYER
DOESNT
NEED
THIS
STUFF
A
CHRISTAIN
MAY
PRAY
TOTALLY
INCOGNITO
AT
ANY
TIME
TO
SOME
EXTENT
THIS
IS
TRUE
OF
MUSLIMS
AND
JEWS
AS
WELL
WHAT
I
INTEND
IN
MY
FIRST
PARAGRAPH
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
CHARACTERISTIC
FORMS
OF
PRAYER
IN
THESE
RELIGIONS
WHICH
DO
NEED
SPECIAL
TIMES
ANDOR
BEHAVIOR
WHICH
CANNOT
BE
UNDERTAKEN
WITHOUT
AN
OBSERVER
BEING
ABLE
TAKING
NOTE
OF
IT
A
CHRISTIAN
MAY
PRAY
AT
ANY
TIME
SILENTLY
AND
WITHOUT
ANY
TRACE
OF
HIS
ACTIVITY
BEING
EVIDENT
TO
OTHERS
THAT
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
TRUE
OF
THE
OTHER
RELIGIOUS
TRADITIONS
AMONGST
US
CERTAINLY
THESE
TEND
TO
HAVE
SOME
FORMS
OF
PRAYER
THAT
WOULD
EVIDENCE
DIFFERENCES
FROM
AMERICANPROTESTANT
MAINSTREAM
RELIGION
ALL
THAT
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
DOES
IS
TO
ALLOW
THAT
ONE
TRADITION
WHICH
DOESNT
NEED
IT
TO
HAVE
A
SPECIAL
PLACE
SET
ASIDE
IN
THE
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIAN
PRAYER
THAT
REQUIRES
PUBLIC
FORMS
OR
RUGS
OR
PHYLACTERIES
OR
ANYTHING
ELSE
AT
ALL
VISIBLE
TO
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD
A
CHRISTIAN
STUDENT
MAY
AND
PROBABLY
DOES
PRAY
AT
INNUMERABLE
TIMES
DURING
THE
DAY
WITHOUT
ANYONE
ELSE
KNOWING
IT
THAT
MAY
ALSO
BE
TRUE
OF
NON
CHRISTIANS
I
AM
NOT
CLAIMNG
OTHERWISE
IN
THE
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
IT
WOULD
STILL
BE
DIFFICULT
FOR
THE
JEWS
TO
GATHER
AND
DAVEN
FOR
THE
MUSLIMS
TO
DO
THEIR
ABLUTIONS
AND
FIND
QIBLAH
TO
MECCA
AND
ENGAGE
IN
THE
PRESCRIBED
FORMS
BUT
OF
COURSE
CHRISTIANS
CAN
DO
THEIR
THING
AND
THEREFORE
THE
PROVISION
IS
NOTHING
BUT
A
DISGUISED
ATTEMPT
TO
ENCOURAGE
JUST
THAT
LUCKILY
THERE
IS
A
STRONG
JEWISH
PRESENCE
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
I
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
REVERE
SOME
OF
THE
JEWISH
TEACHERS
I
HAD
IN
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
AND
A
GROWING
MUSLIM
PRESENCE
AS
WELL
I
CAN
ONLY
HOPE
THAT
THE
POLITICAL
FORCES
CONSEQUENT
ON
THIS
WILL
PREVENT
THE
IMPOSITION
OF
CHRISTIAN
FORMS
ON
NONCHRISTIANS
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
THIS
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
CAMPAIGN
BUT
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
USE
PUBLIC
SOCIAL
PRESSURE
TO
FORCE
CHILDREN
TO
ADHERE
TO
A
PATTERN
THAT
IS
BIASED
TOWARDS
CHRISTIANITY
AND
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
I
MUST
PROTEST
SUCH
COERCION
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
COERCION
IS
NOT
REALLY
TARGETED
AT
THE
NONCHRISTIANS
IT
IS
YET
ANOTHER
CASE
OF
FAILURE
AMONGST
CHRISTIAN
PARENTS
IN
MAKING
THEIR
CHILDREN
PRAYERFUL
SO
THAT
THEY
WANT
THE
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
TO
TEACH
WHAT
THEY
CANNOT
MANAGE
TO
TEACH
DESPITE
HAVING
ALL
THE
OPPORTUNITY
IN
THE
WORLD
TO
DO
SO
IF
YOU
HAVE
TAUGHT
YOUR
CHILDREN
TO
PRAY
THEY
DO
NOT
NEED
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
IN
SCHOOL
IF
YOU
HAVE
NOT
MANAGED
TO
TEACH
THEM
THE
MOMENT
WILL
ONLY
EMBARRASS
YOU
GIVE
IT
UP
MICHAEL

SIEMON
I
SAY
YOU
ARE
