so
what
is
kibology
chopped
liver
kibo
himself
summed
it
up
by
saying
kibology
is
not
just
a
religion
it
is
also
a
candy
mint
and
a
floor
wax
i
personally
think
that
it
is
more
like
spam
clear
im
presently
searching
for
enlightenment
answers
to
the
unanswerable
a
certain
amount
of
direction
without
actually
going
anywhere
could
kibology
be
it
i
dont
know
enough
about
kibology
and
wish
that
someone
can
help
me
after
ive
spread
my
ninth
tube
of
anchovy
paste
on
my
living
room
wall
to
creat
my
own
form
of
art
i
need
some
higher
authority
to
turn
towards
to
give
my
life
some
meaning
maybe
kibology
is
the
answer
its
either
that
or
i
go
out
to
the
store
and
buy
up
another
case
of
anchovy
paste
