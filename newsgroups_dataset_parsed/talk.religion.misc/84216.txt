SALEM
WRITES
IS
THIS
ZENOS
PARADOX
NO
ZENOS
PARADOX
IS
RESOLVED
BY
SHOWING
THAT
INTEGRATION
OR
AN
INFINITE
SERIES
OF
DECREASING
TERMS
CAN
SUM
TO
A
FINITE
RESULT
NOTHING
CAN
GET
OUT
OF
A
BLACK
HOLE
BECAUSE
THE
ESCAPE
VELOCITY
IS
THE
SPEED
OF
LIGHT
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TIME
DIALATION
CAN
PREVENT
MATTER
SPIRALING
IN
FROM
GETTING
TO
THE
EVENT
HORIZON
CAN
ANY
ONE
EXPLAIN
HOW
MATTER
GETS
IN
WELL
SUPPOSE
A
PROBE
EMITTING
RADIATION
AT
A
CONSTANT
FREQUENCY
WAS
SENT
TOWARDS
A
BLACK
HOLE
AS
IT
GOT
CLOSER
TO
THE
EVENT
HORIZON
THE
RED
SHIFT
WOULD
KEEP
INCREASING
THE
PERIOD
WOULD
GET
LONGER
AND
LONGER
BUT
IT
WOULD
NEVER
STOP
AN
OBSERVER
WOULD
NOT
OBSERVE
THE
PROBE
ACTUALLY
REACHING
THE
EVENT
HORIZON
THE
DETECTED
ENERGY
FROM
THE
PROBE
WOULD
KEEP
DECREASING
BUT
IT
WOULDNT
VANISH
EXPT
NEVER
QUITE
REACHES
ZERO
I
GUESS
THE
ABOVE
PROBABLY
DOESNT
MAKE
THINGS
ANY
MORE
CLEAR
BUT
HOPEFULLY
YOU
WILL
GET
THE
GENERAL
IDEA
MAYBE
KEITH
