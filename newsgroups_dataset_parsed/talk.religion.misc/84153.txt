please
get
an
explaination
of
exactly
what
this
nontoxic
tear
gas
was
and
what
the
delivery
system
was
i
refuse
to
believe
any
explaination
provided
by
the
fbiatf
without
lots
of
facts
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
nontoxic
tear
gas
you
are
correct
see
todays
washington
post
the
gas
the
fbi
used
is
most
certainly
fatal
in
high
concentrations
of
course
nontoxic
tear
gas
is
an
oxymoron
the
whole
point
of
tear
gas
is
that
it
is
toxic
and
its
toxic
effects
cause
people
to
seek
fresh
air
legalize
freedom
