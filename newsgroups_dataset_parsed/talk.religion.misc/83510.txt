BILL
RAWLINS
WRITES
HOWEVER
ONE
HIGHLY
BIASED
ACCOUNT
AS
WELL
AS
POSSIBLY
INTERNALLY
INCONSISTENT
WRITTEN
OVER
MELLENIA
AGO
IN
A
DEAD
LANGUAGE
BY
FANATIC
DEVOTEES
OF
THE
CREATURE
IN
QUESTION
WHICH
IS
NOT
SUPPORTED
BY
OTHER
MORE
OBJECTIVE
SOURCES
AND
ISNT
EVEN
ACCEPTED
BY
THOSE
WHOS
MESSIAH
THIS
CREATURE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
DOESNT
CONVINCE
ME
IN
THE
SLIGHTEST
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
MANY
OF
THE
CURRENT
DAY
DEVOTEES
APPEAR
BRAINWASHED
INTO
BELIEVING
THIS
PILE
OF
GUANO
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
REFERRED
TO
THE
MESSIAH
I
ASSUME
YOU
ARE
REFERRING
TO
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
PLEASE
DETAIL
YOUR
COMPLAINTS
OR
EMAIL
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
POST
FIRSTCENTURY
GREEK
IS
WELLKNOWN
AND
WELLUNDERSTOOD
HAVE
YOU
CONSIDERED
JOSEPHUS
THE
JEWISH
HISTORIAN
WHO
ALSO
WROTE
OF
JESUS
IN
ADDITION
THE
FOUR
GOSPEL
ACCOUNTS
ARE
VERY
MUCH
IN
HARMONY
BILL
I
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
TIME
TO
EXPLAIN
THAT
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
CONSIDER
THE
JOSEPHUS
REFERENCE
TO
BE
AN
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
INSERT
BY
BIBLICAL
SCHOLAR
I
MEAN
AN
EXPERT
WHO
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
HIS
OR
HER
RESEARCH
IS
WILLING
TO
LET
THE
CHIPS
FALL
WHERE
THEY
MAY
THIS
EXCLUDES
LITERALISTS
WHO
MAY
OTHERWISE
BE
DEFINED
AS
BIBLICAL
APOLOGISTS
THEY
FIND
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
FIND
THEY
ARE
NOT
TRUSTWORTHY
BY
SCHOLARLY
STANDARDS
AND
OTHERS
WHY
AN
INSERT
READ
IT
I
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
THE
PASSAGE
IS
GLARINGLY
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
AND
JOSEPHUS
A
SUPERB
WRITER
HAD
NO
SUCH
PROBLEM
ELSEWHERE
IN
HIS
WORK
THE
PASSAGE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
SUBJECT
MATTER
IN
WHICH
IT
LIES
IT
SUDDENLY
APPEARS
AND
THEN
JUST
AS
QUICKLY
DISAPPEARS
UNTIL
YOU
CAN
DEMONSTRATE
HOW
AND
WHY
THE
SCHOLARLY
COMMUNITY
IS
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
JOSEPHUS
INSERT
YOUR
PROOF
IS
MEANINGLESS
AND
IT
SHOULD
NOT
BE
REPEATED
HERE
WHATS
MORE
EVEN
IF
JOSEPHUS
HAPPENED
TO
BE
LEGITIMATE
IT
WOULD
PROVE
NOTHING
SCHOLARS
SPEAK
OF
THE
WEIGHT
OF
EVIDENCE
FAR
MORE
INDEPENDENT
EVIDENCE
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
TO
VALIDATE
YOUR
CLAIM
UNTIL
FORTHCOMING
YOUR
BELIEF
IS
BASED
ON
FAITH
THATS
OK
BUT
YOU
EXCEED
YOUR
RIGHTS
WHEN
YOU
PASS
FAITH
OFF
AS
FACT
AS
FOR
THE
GOSPELS
THERE
ARE
PARALLELS
BUT
THERE
ARE
ALSO
GLARING
INCONSISTENCIES
AND
CONTRADICTIONS
SHOULDNT
A
PERFECT
CANON
BE
PERFECT
SHOULDNT
THERE
BE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
ROOM
FOR
DEBATE
I
SUGGEST
YOU
READ
GOSPEL
FICTIONS
BY
RANDEL
HELMS
AND
THE
UNAUTHORIZED
VERSION
BY
ROBIN
FOX
FOR
HERB
HUSTON
NO
KNOWN
KINSHIP
OR
FAMILIAL
RELATIONSHIP
BUT
WE
DO
INDEED
SHARE
AN
EVOLUTIONARY
ANCESTRY
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
ARE
INCONSISTENCIES
GAPS
AND
CONTRADICTIONS
DOES
NOT
DENY
YOUR
POSITION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
NEITHER
DO
THE
GOSPELS
PROVE
YOUR
FAITH
INDEPENDENT
EVIDENCE
IS
NECESSARY
AND
I
KNOW
OF
NONE
WHICH
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
DISCUSSED
AND
SO
FAR
YOU
HAVE
NOT
PROVIDED
ANY
UNTIL
THEN
ITS
FAITH
MOREOVER
YOU
HAVE
COMMITTED
A
FUNDAMENTAL
ERROR
IN
LOGIC
YOU
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
PROVE
YOUR
CLAIM
WITH
THAT
WHICH
YOU
WANT
TO
PROVE
ITS
NO
DIFFERENT
THAN
SAYING
I
AM
RIGHT
BECAUSE
I
SAY
SO
YOUR
LOGIC
IS
FULL
OF
CIRCLES
IT
REMINDS
ME
A
BIT
OF
THE
PRESBYTERIAN

THE

THE
INERRANT
WORD
OF

PRESBYTERIANS
CONSTRUE
INERRANT
BROADLY
AS
SPRITUALLY
INERRANT
FUNDAMENTALISTS
TAKE
THE
FIRST
FOUR
AS
LITERALLY
TRUE
AND
THEN
VALIDATE
THEM
WITH
A
LITERALLY
INERRANT
BIBLE
WHICH
CONTAINS
THE
FIRST
FOUR
AND
WHICH
IS
THE
ONLY
THING
KNOWN
TO
CONTAIN
THE
FIRST
FOUR
SMOKE
AND
MIRRORS
AND
WANDS

THERE
