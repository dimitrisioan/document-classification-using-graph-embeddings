date
apr
gmt
is
the
mormon
church
christs
true
church
lots
of
stuff
about
intellectual
errors
deleted
this
is
cute
but
i
see
no
statement
telling
me
why
your
church
is
the
true
church
i
do
presume
that
you
know
or
at
least
believe
that
yours
is
true
attempting
to
ream
my
faith
without
replacing
it
with
something
better
is
a
real
good
way
to
loose
a
person
completely
from
christ
this
is
the
greatest
reason
i
see
that
these
attacks
are
not
motivated
by
love
they
only
seek
to
destroy
there
is
no
building
or
replacing
of
belief
this
is
not
something
christ
did
he
guided
and
instructed
he
didnt
seek
to
destroy
the
faith
he
found
he
redirected
it
this
is
what
i
see
when
people
say
they
love
insert
favorite
group
here
and
i
have
to
laugh
at
the
irony
please
excuse
the
scarcasm
but
it
was
nice
to
say
it
oh
btw
robert
dont
take
this
personally
your
post
was
merely
convinent
