NOT
EXACTLY
THE
PROPHESY
CLEARLY
IMPLIES
THAT
PEOPLE
WOULD
STILL
BE
LIVING
IN

BUT
BY
THE

TOKEN
IT
WOULD
NEVER
BE
REBUILT
OBVIOUSLY
IF

ARE
STILL
THERE
THEY
WOULD
LIVE
IN

CORRECT
THEIR

IMPLIES
A

VILLAGE
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
IT
HAS
BECOME
A
FAR
CRY
FROM
ITS
ORIGINAL
POSITION
OF
STATURE
LOOKING
AT
WE
FIND
THAT
DURING
ROMAN
TIMES
TYRE
VIED
WITH
SIDON
FOR
FIRST
PLACE
IN
THE
INTELLECTUAL
LIFE
OF
THE
PERIOD
THAT
TYRE
WAS
THE
SEAT
OF
A
CHRISTIAN
BISHOP
EVENTUALLY
WITH
DIOCESES
UNDER
IT
THAT
THE
MOST
MAGNIFICENT
CHURCH
OF
ITS
KIND
IN
ALL
PHOENECIA
WAS
THE
BASILICA
BUILT
IN
TYRE
CA
THAT
TYRE
WAS
WELL
KNOWN
FOR
ITS
EXPORTS
OF
GLASSWARE
WINE
WHITE
MARBLE
AND
DYED
CLOTH
THAT
TYRE
ALONG
WITH
OTHER
SEAPORTS
PROVIDED
OUTLETS
FOR
SOUTH
ARABIAN
INDIAN
AND
EVEN
CHINESE
TRADE
THAT
TYRE
HAD
TO
ACCOMODATE
ITS
GROWING
POPULATION
BY
FOLLOWING
A
PERPENDICULAR
RATHER
THAN
HORIZONTAL
LINE
OF
GROWTH
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
RUNNING
OUT
OF
LAND
TO
BUILD
ON
THAT
TYRE
ESTABLISHED
COLONIES
OF
ITS
OWN
NONE
OF
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
SMALL

VILLAGE
BY
ANY
STRETCH
OF
THE
IMAGINATION
CENTURIES
LATER
UNDER
THE
ABBASIDS
TYRE
HAD
OPULENT
AND
FLOURISHING
BAZAARS
AND
BUILDINGS
OF

DURING
THIS
PERIOD
TYRE
WAS
NOTED
FOR
ITS
EXPORT
OF
SUGAR
BEADS
AND
AS
OF
OLD
GLASSWARE
DURING
THE
CRUSADES
TYRE
WAS
THE
SECONDMOST
FLOURISHING

THERE
IS
A

THAT
AFTER

WITHDRAWEL

APPEARED
TO
ENJOY
A
REVIVAL
OF

IF
TYRE
IS
SUCH
AN
INSIGNIFICANT
LITTLE

VILLAGE
AT

WHY
IS
IT
ALWAYS

WHY
DOES
IT
SHOW

A

COMPARATIVELY

ALSO
SO
I
DOUBT
THAT
IT
IS
A
TYPO
PERHAPS
THESE
WERE
FIGURES
FOR
THE
CITIES
AND
THEIR
SURROUNDING
AREAS
I
DONT
DOUBT
THAT
THE
POPULATION
OF
TYRE
HAS
FLUCTUATED
OVER
THE
LAST
FEW
DECADES
IN

THE
ISRAELI
MILITARY

HURT

QUITE
A

IT
FELL

IN

BELIEVE

DID

FALL
THAT
YOU
WERE
THINKING
OF

TO

ROME
BCE
AFTER

IT
FELL
TO

WHEN

IT
WAS
THEN
RECAPTURED
AGAIN
BY
THE
MUSLIMS
IN

AND
SUBSEQUENTLY
PILLAGED
THEN
THE
FRENCH
TURKS
BRITISH
AND
TODAY
LEBANON
I
THOUGHT
YOU
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
TIMES
THAT
TYRE
WAS
DESTROYED
DONT
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
OF
THESE
APPLY
NOT
JUST
TO
TYRE
BUT
TO
THE
OTHER
CITIES
IN
THE
AREA
SIDON
FOR
EXAMPLE
CAN
YOU
MAKE
A
CASE
FOR
TYRE
HAVING
BEEN
SINGLED
OUT
WELL
IT
RECOVERED
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
A
THRIVING
COMMERCE
IN
THE
DYE
TYRIAN
PURPLE
IN
ROMAN
TIMES
THIS
IS
CORRECT
BUT
THEY
WERE
UNDER
ROMAN
DOMINATION
AND
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
CREATED
WEALTH
WAS
SIPHONED
OFF
THE
PROPHESY
HOLD
TRUE
THEY
HAD
A
GOOD
DEAL
OF
AUTONOMY
UNDER
THE
SELEUCIDS
FROM
TYRE
RECEIVED
THE
RIGHTS
OF
AUTONOMY
FROM
ANTIOCHUS
EPHIPHANES
AND
FROM
BC
ONWARD
ENJOYED
COMPLETE
AUTONOMY
SHE
STARTED
A
LARGE
SERIES

COINS
OCCASIONALLY
IN

THE
DESCRIPTIONS
OF

UNDER
THE
ROMANS
DONT
SEEM
TO
FIT
YOUR
CHARACTERIZATION
EITHER
AND
UNDER
THE
ABBASIDS
IT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
ALLOWED
TO
FLOURISH
I
STILL
THINK
YOU
ARE
STRETCHING
WHEN
YOU
TRY
TO
DESCRIBE
TYRE
AS
HAVING
BEEN
NOTHING
BUT
A
SMALL
FISHING
VILLAGE

YOU
ARE

AN
ARGUMENT
THAT
I
HAVENT

ANYWHERE

WHICH
IS
WHY
I
JUMPED
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
YOU
WERE

TRIED
