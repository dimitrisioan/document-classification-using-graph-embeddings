john
e
king
writes
not
exactly
the
prophesy
clearly
implies
that
people
would
still
be
living
in
the
area
but
by
the
same
token
it
would
never
be
rebuilt
obviously
if
people
are
still
there
they
would
live
in
houses
correct
their
nets
implies
a
fishing
village
this
is
exactly
what
it
has
become
a
far
cry
from
its
original
position
of
stature
looking
at
we
find
that
during
roman
times
tyre
vied
with
sidon
for
first
place
in
the
intellectual
life
of
the
period
that
tyre
was
the
seat
of
a
christian
bishop
eventually
with
dioceses
under
it
that
the
most
magnificent
church
of
its
kind
in
all
phoenecia
was
the
basilica
built
in
tyre
ca
that
tyre
was
well
known
for
its
exports
of
glassware
wine
white
marble
and
dyed
cloth
that
tyre
along
with
other
seaports
provided
outlets
for
south
arabian
indian
and
even
chinese
trade
that
tyre
had
to
accomodate
its
growing
population
by
following
a
perpendicular
rather
than
horizontal
line
of
growth
because
it
was
running
out
of
land
to
build
on
that
tyre
established
colonies
of
its
own
none
of
this
sounds
like
a
small
fishing
village
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
centuries
later
under
the
abbasids
tyre
had
opulent
and
flourishing
bazaars
and
buildings
of
stories
during
this
period
tyre
was
noted
for
its
export
of
sugar
beads
and
as
of
old
glassware
during
the
crusades
tyre
was
the
secondmost
flourishing
city
held
by
franks
there
is
a
lot
more
but
i
got
tired
of
writing
in
we
read
the
following
description
of
modern
lebanon
other
major
cities
in
lebanon
include
tripoli
sidon
tyre
baalbek
and
zahlah
my
emphasis
this
source
also
discusses
the
impact
of
the
lebanese
civil
war
and
the
israeli
military
actions
on
the
trading
ports
of
tyre
and
sidon
it
notes
that
after
israels
withdrawel
in
tyre
appeared
to
enjoy
a
revival
of
its
local
economy
if
tyre
is
such
an
insignificant
little
fishing
village
at
present
why
is
it
always
called
a
city
or
above
a
major
city
why
does
it
show
up
on
all
the
maps
when
population
figures
for
cities
in
lebanon
are
given
why
is
tyre
always
one
of
the
cities
on
the
list
even
if
the
list
is
only
a
dozen
cities
long

federal

lebanon
a
country
study
edited
by
thomas
collelo
in
the
early
tyre
had
over
people
so
far
ive
seen
stated
figurers
ranging
from
to
lets
assume
the
latter
one
is
correct
by
modern
standards
we
are
talking
about
a
onehorse
town
a
onehorse
town
sounds
like
a
lot
of
work
for
one
horse
anyway
tyre
is
connected
by
roads
to
the
mainland
they
may
even
use
cars
these
days
the
encyclopedia
britannica
says
pop
est
most
other
references
give
figures
in
the
thousand
range
one
atlas
gives
the
population
of
tyre
as
the
same
source
give
comparatively
high
figures
for
sidon
and
beirut
also
so
i
doubt
that
it
is
a
typo
perhaps
these
were
figures
for
the
cities
and
their
surrounding
areas
i
dont
doubt
that
the
population
of
tyre
has
fluctuated
over
the
last
few
decades
in
particular
the
israeli
military
action
hurt
tyre
quite
a
bit
after
alex
the
g
it
fell
once
more
in
the
i
believe
what
other
times
did
it
fall
that
you
were
thinking
of
to
egypt
bce
to
the
seleucids
bce
rome
bce
after
rome
it
fell
to
various
arab
contingents
until
ce
when
it
was
captured
in
the
crusades
it
was
then
recaptured
again
by
the
muslims
in
ce
and
subsequently
pillaged
then
the
french
turks
british
and
today
lebanon
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
times
that
tyre
was
destroyed
dont
most
if
not
all
of
these
apply
not
just
to
tyre
but
to
the
other
cities
in
the
area
sidon
for
example
can
you
make
a
case
for
tyre
having
been
singled
out
well
it
recovered
enough
to
have
a
thriving
commerce
in
the
dye
tyrian
purple
in
roman
times
this
is
correct
but
they
were
under
roman
domination
and
the
majority
of
the
created
wealth
was
siphoned
off
the
prophesy
hold
true
they
had
a
good
deal
of
autonomy
under
the
seleucids
from
tyre
received
the
rights
of
autonomy
from
antiochus
ephiphanes
and
from
bc
onward
enjoyed
complete
autonomy
she
started
a
large
series
of
coins
occasionally
in
gold
the
descriptions
of
tyre
under
the
romans
dont
seem
to
fit
your
characterization
either
and
under
the
abbasids
it
seems
to
have
been
allowed
to
flourish
i
still
think
you
are
stretching
when
you
try
to
describe
tyre
as
having
been
nothing
but
a
small
fishing
village
who
is
josh
mcdowell
a
christian
apologist
whose
standards
of
scholarship
are
quite
low
he
happens
to
quote
the
same
source
you
quote
nina
jidejian
tyre
through
the
ages
beirut
dar
elmashreq
publishers
the
same
sentence
in
fact
he
defends
the
fulfillment
of
the
prophecy
using
the
same
argument
you
are
using
an
argument
that
i
havent
seen
in
print
anywhere
else
which
is
why
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
you
were
quoting
josh
i
tried
to
find
the
jidejian
book
but
it
isnt
listed
in
books
in
print
can
you
tell
me
more
about
it
her
descriptions
are
so
much
at
odds
with
everything
else
ive
read
im
curious
to
know
why
