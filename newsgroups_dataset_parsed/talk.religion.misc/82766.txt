christian
devil
revealed
from
pharveyquackkfucom
paul
harvey
for
a
while
i
was
puzzled
by
the
the
concept
of
adam
and
eve
coming
to
know
good
and
evil
this
is
how
i
resolved
it
within
gods
universe
each
action
evokes
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction
there
can
be
no
good
without
evil
as
an
opposite
so
the
issue
is
not
what
you
do
but
to
whom
you
give
your
allegiance
that
is
why
even
in
this
sinful
state
when
we
perform
an
evil
act
while
we
are
submitted
to
god
he
does
not
place
that
sinful
act
to
our
account
rom
in
the
same
vein
you
can
perform
all
the
good
deeds
in
the
book
if
your
life
is
not
under
gods
control
you
are
still
sinning
see
rom
now
take
a
good
look
at
at
an
tell
me
man
there
is
no
christian
devil
there
is
is
real
is
a
virus
a
meme
infecting
and
possessing
the
good
people
and
keep
em
from
becoming
human
beings
with
emphasis
on
the
being
is
not
a
matter
of
good
people
an
evil
people
is
all
good
people
see
but
some
good
people
