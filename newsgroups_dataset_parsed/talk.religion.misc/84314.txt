THEY

IN
THAT

AS
AN
ALMOST
MYTHICAL
FIGURE
ONE
FROM

EXTREMELY
DISTANT

OF

TO
THE

THAT

SCHOLARS
ARE

ON
THE

VIEW
IT
AS
HISTORICALLY
RELIABLE
WHILE

BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
DEVOID

THE
MOST
CONVINCING
ARGUMENTS
HOWEVER
SEEM
TO
SUPPORT
THE
LATTER
POSITION
THE
FIGURE
OF

IS
ACCURATE
ONLY
ON
THE

BECAUSE
IT
REPRESENTS
IN

THE
MORE
GENERAL
ONE
OF
WHICH
WAS
EMPLOYED
BY
SASANID
PROPAGANDISTS
TO
LOCATE
ZARATHUSHTRAS
LIFETIME
ROUGHLY
AROUND
THE
BEGINNING
OF
IRANIAN
DOMINATION
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
CONNECTED
WITH
COMPLEX
PROBLEMS
INHERENT
IN
THE
IRANIAN
CHRONOLOGY
THERE
WAS
ALSO
A
DESIRE
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
SASANID

TO
AVOID
ANY

THREAT
IN

AS

THUS
EXPLAINING
THE
DOUBLE
DATE
OF
AND

BEFORE
ALEXANDER
GIVEN
THE
UNRELIABILITY
OF
THE

SOURCES
WE
ARE
FORCED
TO
RECONSTRUCT
AN
ABSOLUTE
CHRONOLOGY
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
OTHER
ELEMENTS
PRINCIPALLY
ON
THE
CONTENTION
THAT
ZARATHUSHTRA
MUST
HAVE
LIVED
A
FEW
CENTURIES
BEFORE

THE
GREAT
CAMBYSES
AND
DARIUS
AS
THERE
IS
NO
MENTION
IN

ACHIEVEMENTS
THAT
TOOK

IN

AT

OF

WOULD
NOT

CONSEQUENTLY
THE
TRADITIONALLY
ACCEPTED
THEORY
OF
PLACING
ZARA
THUSHTRA
AROUND
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
FIRST
MILLENNIUM
BCE
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
MOST
LEGITIMATE
AS
TO
ZARATHUSHTRAS
LAND
OF
ORIGIN
MANY
SCHOLARS
AGREE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
VALID
ARGUMENTS
THAT
HE
MUST
HAVE
COME
FROM
EASTERN
IRAN
SOME
HAVE
HELD
THAT
HE
WAS
A
MEDE
LARGELY
BECAUSE
OF
A
LATE
IRANIAN
TRADITION
LINKING
ZARATHUSHTRA
WITH
AZERBAIJAN
BUT
ALSO
BECAUSE
OF
LINGUISTIC
REASONS
BASED
ON
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
THE
AVESTA
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
HOWEVER
SHOULD
BE
DISCARDED
AS
WE
CAN
SUPPOSE
BOTH
ON
HISTORICAL
AND
LINGUISTIC
GROUNDS
THAT
ZARATHUSHTRA
CAME
FROM
THE
EAST
EVEN
THOUGH
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
PRECISELY
FROM
WHICH
REGION
THERE
IS
A
CONSIDERABLE
VARIETY
OF
OPINION
ON
THIS

MATTER
INCLUDING
THE
IMPROBABLE
VIEW
THAT
HE
CAME
FROM
CHORASMIA

OR
FROM
A
WIDER
CHORASMIAN
REGION
REACHING
AS
FAR
AS
THE
