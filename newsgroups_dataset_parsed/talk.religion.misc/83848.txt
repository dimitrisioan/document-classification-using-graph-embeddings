third
sign
the
miracles
of
muhammad
saw
are
extremely
varied
because
his
messengership
is
universal
he
has
been
distinguished
by
miracles
that
relate
to
almost
all
species
of
creation
just
as
the
supreme
aide
of
a
renowned
ruler
arriving
with
many
gifts
in
a
city
where
various
people
live
will
be
welcomed
by
a
representative
of
each
people
who
acclaims
him
and
bids
him
welcome
in
his
own
language
so
too
when
the
supreme
messenger
of
the
monarch
of
pre
and
posteternity
ezel
and
ebed
sultani
honored
the
universe
by
coming
as
an
envoy
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
brought
with
him
the
light
of
truth
and
spiritual
gifts
sent
by
the
creator
of
the
universe
and
derived
from
the
realities
of
the
whole
universe
each
species
of
creation
from
water
rocks
trees
animals
and
human
beings
to
the
moon
sun
and
stars
welcomed
him
and
acclaimed
his
prophethood
each
in
its
own
language
and
each
bearing
one
of
his
miracles
now
it
would
require
a
voluminous
work
to
mention
all
his
miracles
as
the
punctilious
scholars
have
written
many
volumes
concerning
the
proofs
of
his
prophethood
here
we
will
briefly
point
out
only
the
general
category
into
which
fall
fhe
miracles
that
are
definite
and
accepted
as
accurate
reports
the
evidences
of
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
saw
fall
into
two
main
categories
the
first
is
called
irhasat
and
includes
the
paranormal
events
that
happened
at
the
time
of
his
birth
or
before
his
declaration
of
prophethood
the
second
group
pertains
to
all
the
remaining
evidences
of
the
prophethood
and
contains
two
subdivisions
those
wonders
that
were
manifested
after
his
departure
from
this
world
in
order
to
confirm
his
prophethood
and
those
that
he
exhibited
during
the
era
of
his
prophethood
the
latter
has
also
two
parts
the
evidences
of
his
prophethood
that
became
manifest
in
his
own
personality
his
inner
and
outer
being
his
moral
conduct
and
perfection
and
the
miracles
that
related
to
substantial
matters
the
last
part
again
has
two
branches
those
concerning
the
quran
and
spirituality
and
those
relating
to
matter
and
creation
this
last
branch
is
again
divided
into
two
categories
the
first
involves
the
paranormal
happenings
that
occured
during
his
mission
either
to
break
the
stubbornness
of
the
unbelievers
or
to
augment
the
faith
of
the
belivers
this
category
has
twenty
different
sorts
such
as
the
splitting
of
the
moon
the
flowing
of
water
from
the
fingers
the
satisfying
of
large
numbers
with
a
little
food
and
the
speaking
of
trees
rocks
and
animals
each
of
these
sons
has
also
many
instances
and
thus
has
in
meaning
the
strength
of
confirmation
by
consensus
as
for
the
second
category
this
includes
events
lying
in
the
future
that
occured
as
he
had
predicted
upon
allah
swts
instructions
now
starting
from
the
last
category
we
will
summarize
a
list
of
unfonunately
i
could
not
write
as
i
had
intended
without
choice
i
wrote
as
my
head
dictated
and
i
could
not
completely
conform
to
the
order
of
this
classification
to
be
continued
allah
willing

islam
