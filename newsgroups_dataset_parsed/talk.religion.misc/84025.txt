tis
someone
just
told
me
that
the
old
testament
books
were
translated
into
greek
a
long
time
ago
yes
thats
a
famous
version
called
the
septuagint
it
was
a
translation
made
by
greek
jews
and
that
the
originals
were
destroyed
in
a
fire
soon
afterward
i
dont
know
what
youre
referring
to
here
when
the
jersusalem
temple
was
destroyed
some
manuscripts
may
have
been
lost
but
i
think
our
extant
hebrew
manuscripts
are
as
good
as
our
greek
ones
i
dont
know
about
any
originals
the
person
who
was
telling
me
about
the
septuagint
version
said
that
the
greeks
had
a
wonderful
library
in
alexandria
that
was
full
of
manuscriptsscrolls
and
that
it
was
burned
soon
after
the
septuagint
version
was
translated
perhaps
to
conceal
some
changes
in
the
different
versions
or
perhaps
just
as
part
of
the
typical
burning
of
valuable
things
that
occurs
during
changes
in
power
groups
hei
dunno
so
i
was
just
wondering
since
i
imagine
some
jewish
people
somewhere
must
have
had
copies
of
the
earlier
hebrew
versions
is
the
hebrew
version
of
the
old
testament
very
different
from
the
greek
derived
version
no
there
are
a
few
famous
discrepancies
isaiahs
prophecy
about
a
young
woman
was
changed
into
a
virgin
which
was
how
the
new
testament
writers
read
it
but
not
many
well
perhaps
this
is
the
answer
then
deleted
if
you
go
to
a
jewish
bookstore
youll
get
a
bible
translated
by
jews
so
there
will
be
some
differences
in
interpretation
but
the
text
theyre
translating
from
is
basically
the
same
if
you
want
to
read
the
original
you
can
buy
an
interlinear
bible
that
contains
the
hebrew
old
testament
and
the
greek
new
testament
with
an
english
translation
written
underneath
each
word
if
you
want
a
bible
with
a
possiblymoreoriginal
basic
text
you
can
try
to
find
a
samaritan
bible
good
luck
ive
never
seen
one
the
samaritans
no
not
the
good
samaritans
have
their
own
version
of
the
books
of
moses
they
claim
the
jewish
bible
was
altered
by
ezra
thanks
for
the
tips
now
i
just
have
to
find
someone
to
teach
me
samaritan
just
me
little
e
so
is
a
good
samaritan
hard
to
find
or
is
a
hard
oh
finish
this
yourself
