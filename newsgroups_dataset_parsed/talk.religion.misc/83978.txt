OBJECTIVITY
WAS
AFTER
YEARS
THIS
DISCUSSION
ON
OBJECTIVE
SEEMS
TO
BE
FALLING
INTO
SOLIPSISM
EG
THE
RECENT
CHALLENGE
FROM
FRANK
DWYER
FOR
SOMEONE
TO
PROVE
THAT
HE
CAN
ACTUALLY
OBSERVE
PHENOMENA
SOMEONES
EVEN
MADE
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
SCIENCE
IS
SUBJECTIVE
AND
THAT
EVEN
ATOM
ARE
SUBJECTIVE
THIS
IS
GETTING
A
BIT
SILLY
AND
THE
WORD
OBJECTIVE
IS
LOSING
ALL
MEANING
LETS
START
BY
REMEMBERING
THE
DEFINITION
OF
OBJECTIVE
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
ALREADY
PRESENTED
OBJECTIVE
ADJ
OF
OR
HAVING
TO
DO
WITH
A
MATERIAL
OBJECT
AS
DISTINGUISHED
FROM
A
MENTAL
CONCEPT
HAVING
ACTUAL
EXISTENCE
UNENFLUENCED
BY
EMOTION
OR
PERSONAL
PREJUDICE
B
BASED
ON
OBSERVABLE
PHENOMENON
THE
OBJECTIVITY
OF
A
THING
IS
NOT
BASED
ON
WHETHER
EVERYONE
AGREES
ON
THAT
THING
EG
THE
WORLD
IS
OBJECTIVELY
ROUND
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
EXIST
FLAT
EARTHERS
BUT
RATHER
WHETHER
IT
IS
BASED
OBSERVABLE
AND
VERIFIABLE
PHENOMENON
INSTEAD
OF
BEING
BASED
SOLELY
ON
PEOPLES
WISHES
FEELING
MENTAL
PROCESSES
ETC
THUS
ATOMS
BEING
BASED
ON
VERY
OBSERVABLE
AND
REPEATABLE
PHENOMENON
ARE
INDEED
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
OBJECTIVE
RATHER
THAN
SUBJECTIVE
EVEN
WEIRD
HIGH
ENERGY
PHYSICS
IS
BASED
ON
OBSERVABLE
PHENOMENON
EVEN
THOUGH
THAT
OBSERVATION
CAN
CHANGE
THE
OUTCOME
NOR
ARE
THOSE
OBSERVABLE
PHENOMENON
AFFECTED
BY
EMOTION
OR
PERSONAL
PREJUDICE
EG
CHEMICAL
REACTIONS
DO
NOT
CHANGE
TO
THE
WHIMS
OF
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
THUS
TO
SAY
THAT
SCIENCE
IS
NOT
OBJECTIVE
IE
OBJECTIVELY
VERIFIABLE
IS
A
BIT
SILLY
AS
THAT
IS
THE
POINT
OF
SCIENCE
NOW
I
WILL
AGREE
THAT
SCIENCE
IS
NOT
OBJECTIVELY
GOOD
I
WILL
NOT
THEREBY
CONCLUDE
THOUGH
THAT
SCIENCE
IS
NOT
OBJECTIVE
NOW
SOME
EXAMPLES
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
OBJECTIVE
A
TRACTOR
IS
LARGER
THAN
THE
AVERAGE
BREADBOX
CHLOROPHYLL
IS
GREEN
SEAWATER
CONTAINS
SALT
THERE
EXISTS
OZONE
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE
AT
LEAST
PRESENTLY
OZONE
BLOCKS
ULTRAVIOLET
LIGHT
ULTRAVIOLET
LIGHT
INCREASES
THE
INCIDENTS
OF
SKIN
CANCER
GOOD
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
A
VALUE
JUDGEMENT
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
AN
EXISTENCE
APART
FROM
WHAT
WE
GIVE
IT
UNLESS
SOMEONE
CAN
OBJECTIVELY
SHOW
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
AN
OMNIPOTENT
ENTITY
WHICH
HAS
DEFINED
GOOD
WE
CANNOT
QUANTIFY
IT
TOUCH
IT
OR
COLLECT
IT
IN
ANY
CONCRETE
SENSE
EG
I
HAVE
A
BAG
FULL
OF
GOOD
NOW
WE
DO
SOMETIMES
ATTEMPT
TO
GIVE
THE
WORD
GOOD
AN
OBJECTIVE
MEANING
EG
GOOD
HAS
BEEN
USED
TO
DENOTE
STRENGTH
RESILIENCY
SPEED
ETC
THAT
THOUGH
IS
A
SUBJECTIVE
DEFINITION
AS
SOME
MIGHT
NOT
SEE
STRENGTH
AND
ETC
AS
NECESSARILY
GOOD
EG
STRENGTH
INSPIRED
BY
NAZIISM
IS
NOT
GENERALLY
VIEWED
AS
GOOD
AS
TO
A
MORALITY
I
CANNOT
SAY
THAT
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN
A
MORALITY
STRICTLY
BASED
ON
VERIFIABLE
OBSERVABLE
PHENOMENON
THE
CLOSEST
I
HAVE
SEEN
IS
SOME
FORM
OF
THE
GOLDEN
RULE
WHICH
CONCLUDES
THAT
IT
IS
BEST
NOT
TO
DELIBERATELY
PISS
PEOPLE
OFF
AS
THEY
WILL
LIKELY
THEN
INVOLVE
THEMSELVES
IN
YOUR
LIFE
IN
A
MANNER
YOU
WONT
LIKE
THIS
IS
VERIFIABLE
WHEN
YOU
GET
IN
SOMEONES
FACE
THEY
WILL
OFTEN
RETALIATE
ANOTHER
OBJECTIVE
FACT
ABOUT
MORALITY
IS
THAT
A
MORE
POWERFUL
GROUP
CAN
ENFORCE
THEIR
MORALITY
ON
A
WEAKER
GROUP
AND
THUS
CAN
AT
TIMES
IGNORE
THAT
FORM
OF
THE
GOLDEN
RULE
WITHOUT
FEAR
OF
REPRISAL
NOW
AS
TO
WHETHER
THIS
ENFORCING
OF
MORALITY
IS
GOOD
OR
BAD
IS
QUITE
SUBJECTIVE
BY
THE
WAY
REMEMBER
THAT
SUBJECTIVE
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
A
THING
CANNOT
BE
FORMALLY
STATED
OR
EVEN
COMMONLY
AGREED
UPON
IT
ONLY
MEANS
THAT
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
VERIFIABLE
FROM
OBSERVABLE
PHENOMENA
OR
HAS
A
PHYSICAL
EXISTENCE
UNTO
ITSELF
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
STATED
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
AN
OBJECTIVE
MORALITY
OR
THAT
I
COULD
NOT
ACCEPT
ANY
SUCH
A
MORALITY
I
HAVE
SIMPLY
STATED
THAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
ANY
SUCH
MORALITY
ONE
OTHER
THING
TO
NOTICE
OBJECTIVE
IS
MANY
TIMES
USED
AS
SYNONYMOUS
WITH
TRUE
ANDOR
ABSOLUTE
AND
SUBJECTIVE
SOMETIMES
HAS
THE
CONNOTATION
OF
FALSE
ANDOR
RELATIVE
TAINT
NECESSARILY
SO
FOR
INSTANCE
WHEN
A
CONCLUSION
IS
BASED
ON
OBJECTIVE
BUT
INSUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE
THEN
IT
CAN
BE
BOTH
OBJECTIVE
AND
FALSE
AS
TO
ABSOLUTE
IT
IS
EASY
TO
NOTE
THAT
WHILE
WE
CAN
OBJECTIVELY
SHOW
THAT
TNT
IS
EXPLOSIVE
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
ABSOLUTELY
MEAN
THAT
ALL
TNT
WILL
EXPLODE
AND
THUS
OBJECTIVE
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
ABSOLUTE
EITHER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
SOMETHING
SUBJECTIVE
CAN
ALSO
BE
EITHER
ABSOLUTIST
OR
TRUE
FOR
INSTANCE
THERE
ARE
SOME
THEISTS
WHO
ARE
SPECIFICALLY
ABSOLUTIST
IN
THEIR
MORALITY
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
HAVE
ONLY
SUBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
TO
BACK
IT
UP
FURTHER
MANY
A
SCIENTIST
AND
DETECTIVE
HAS
BEEN
MOTIVATED
BY
SUBJECTIVE
REASONS
EG
A
GUT
FEELING
OR
HUNCH
TO
INVESTIGATE
A
PHENOMENA
OR
SITUATION
AND
GATHER
THE
OBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
NECESSARY
TO
SUPPORT
A
TRUE
HYPOTHESIS
ON
THE
WHOLE
THOUGH
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
AGREE
THAT
OBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
IS
MUCH
MORE
TRUSTWORTHY
THAN
SUBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
LATER
DAVE
BUTLER
IN
STARTING
ANY
THESIS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
ONE
SHOULD
PUT
FORWARD
AS
ONES
POINT
OF
DEPARTURE
SOMETHING
INCONTROVERTIBLE
THE
EXPRESSION
SHOULD
BE
SIMPLE
AND
DIGNIFIED
DIOGENES
