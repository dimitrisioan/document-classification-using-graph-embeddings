perhaps
out
of
dedication
to
your
convictions
i
never
never
thought
that
you
would
be
consciously
intellectually
dishonest
though
i
am
not
can
you
show
me
anything
that
would
lead
you
to
think
otherwise
see
the
spreading
christianity
thread
in
which
he
says
i
ignore
certain
statements
that
i
specifically
acknowledged
and
dean
did
not
he
called
them
the
great
commission
but
this
is
not
descriptive
of
jesuss
words
in
matt
matt
jerusalem
bible
translation
and
if
anyone
does
not
welcome
you
or
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say
as
you
walk
out
of
the
house
or
town
shake
the
dust
from
your
feet
matt
i
tell
you
solemnly
on
the
day
of
judgment
it
will
not
go
as
hard
with
the
land
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
as
with
that
town
in
the
post
to
which
dean
is
referring
above
i
said
the
above
is
a
good
description
of
kaflowitz
who
keeps
harping
on
shaking
the
dust
off
the
feet
but
ignoring
what
christ
said
next
the
highlighted
words
refer
to
matt
and
respectively
and
dean
countered
actually
this
comment
of
yours
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
an
intellectually
dishonest
little
sparrowfart
you
are
since
i
specifically
acknowledged
the
great
commission
and
the
entreaty
to
spread
the
word
in
fact
it
is
the
combination
of
the
two
statements
i
was
addressing
and
not
just
the
one
and
for
you
to
characterize
that
as
ignoring
the
instruction
to
spread
the
word
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
dishonest
little
fellow
you
are
of
course
matt
quoted
above
makes
no
mention
of
instruction
to
spread
the
word
all
these
quotes
btw
are
from
messageid
in
which
at
the
end
he
claims
i
did
not
answer
a
question
which
i
answered
and
which
he
deleted
to
get
the
chronology
right
he
deleted
the
answer
and
then
said
i
didnt
answer
and
i
claim
it
correctly
because
my
question
went
do
you
too
measure
the
goodness
of
a
post
by
its
entertainment
value
and
care
not
a
whit
for
such
mundane
things
as
truth
and
falsehood
and
the
closest
dean
came
to
an
answer
was
peter
peter
peter
youre
just
so
stupid
pretentious
dull
and
generally
unworthy
of
the
value
you
place
on
yourself
that
the
sport
is
all
there
is
of
course
this
does
not
answer
my
question
which
has
to
do
with
posts
in
general
and
not
my
posts
in
particular
surely
even
dean
knows
this
yet
he
brazenly
asserts
otherwise
reinforcing
his
claim
with
an
insult
so
i
now
restore
the
answer
to
your
question
that
you
deleted
if
youre
still
unable
to
figure
it
out
ask
a
nice
kid
at
the
local
junior
high
to
help
you
it
really
doesnt
take
much
sophistication
to
understand
on
top
of
which
i
doubt
that
the
answer
is
at
all
representative
of
deans
true
frame
of
mind
the
insults
you
have
seen
quoted
thus
far
are
but
a
small
sample
of
the
stream
that
oozes
out
of
deans
mind
throughout
the
post
from
which
these
quotes
were
taken
one
wonders
whether
deans
mind
is
so
warped
as
to
find
sport
in
all
this
he
even
dredges
up
a
falsified
account
of
events
that
transpired
earlier
on
another
thread
you
made
an
ass
of
yourself
by
claiming
that
it
was
in
the
tradition
of
lent
to
make
public
announcements
of
the
sins
of
other
individuals
false
i
said
it
was
the
tradition
to
recall
and
atone
for
ones
sins
that
i
made
public
announcements
of
the
sins
of
others
sins
btw
that
were
a
matter
of
public
record
documented
in
the
posts
of
others
is
a
different
matter
many
of
the
individuals
involved
are
so
nearly
amoral
that
they
do
not
see
as
sins
what
morally
upright
people
see
as
sins
so
i
pointed
some
of
them
out
and
i
expressly
set
up
a
whole
thread
your
turn
to
let
people
point
out
my
sins
to
me
dean
again
you
made
an
ass
of
yourself
by
saying
that
my
statement
of
the
tradition
of
tzedukkah
was
somehow
an
attempt
to
paint
jews
as
plaster
saints
thereby
revealing
your
inability
to
understand
the
discussion
as
well
as
showing
your
dislike
for
people
saying
positive
things
about
jews
and
now
you
show
your
intellectual
dishonesty
by
repeatedly
ignoring
the
simple
argument
being
made
and
then
claiming
i
am
ignoring
the
very
argument
i
acknowledge
actually
what
happened
was
that
dean
made
it
seem
like
any
jew
who
gave
alms
or
did
other
acts
of
charity
in
public
was
a
hypocrite
according
to
jewish
customs
in
doing
so
he
was
caricaturing
jewish
customs
as
being
almost
impossibly
demanding
as
well
as
implicitly
slandering
all
jews
who
make
public
their
acts
of
charity
i
went
very
easily
on
dean
for
this
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
a
post
following
my
initial
crack
about
plaster
saints
suggesting
that
he
had
been
merely
careless
in
his
wording
in
an
astonishing
act
of
ingratitude
dean
now
serves
up
an
incredibly
distorted
picture
of
what
took
place
between
us
and
using
it
as
the
basis
of
one
insult
after
another
