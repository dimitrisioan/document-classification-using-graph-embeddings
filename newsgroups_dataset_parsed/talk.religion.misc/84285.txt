ANNOTATED
STUDY
OF
DAVID
KORESHS
SERMON
DOESNT
BOTHER
ME
ITS
PROBABLE
THAT
A
CAREFUL
REVIEW
OF
WHAT
STEPHEN
HAS
DONE
WITH
OBVIOUS
EXPENDITURE
OF
THOUGHTFUL
EFFORT
WOULD
PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL
INSIGHT
INTO
DAVID
AND
HIS
LOVE
FOR
GOD
MAY
HIS
SOUL
REST
IN
PEACE
AND
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
AGREE
WITH
VARIOUS
POINTS
OF
THEOLOGY
THEREIN
A
REVIEW
WOULD
LIKELY
PROVIDE
SIGNIFICANT
INSIGHT
INTO
OUR
OWN
LOVE
FOR
GOD
ONE
THING
THAT
SEEMS
APPARENT
FROM
EVEN
A
CURSORY
READING
OF
KORESHS
MESSAGE
IS
THAT
HE
WAS
NOT
THE
LOONEY
TUNES
PORTRAYED
IN
THE
FBI
FILTERED
PRESS
REPORTS
ON
HIM
BUT
WAS
QUITE
POSSIBLY
THE
FRIENDLY
LIKEABLE
PERSON
HIS
ATTORNEY
REPORTED
HIM
TO
BE
SOMEONE
STATED
THAT
THE
DAVIDIAN
CULT
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
WELL
I
READ
ALL
THOSE
FOUR
POSTINGS
AND
IM
NOW
EVEN
MORE
CONVINCED
THAT
DAVIDIDIANS
ARE
TRULY
CHRISTIAN
IN
NATURE
BUT
SOMETIMES
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
RELABEL
THE
CULT
ESPECIALLY
IF
THE
UGLINESS
IS
TOO
MUCH
