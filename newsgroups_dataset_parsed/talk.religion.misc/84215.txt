RE
THE
UNIVERSE
AND
BLACK
HOLES
WAS

LETS
SAY
THAT
WE
DROP
A
MARBLE
INTO
THE
BLACK
HOLE
IT
RACES
EVER
FASTER
TOWARDS
THE
EVEN
HORIZON
BUT
THANKS
TO
THE
CURVING
OF
SPACE
CAUSED
BY
THE
EXCESSIVE
GRAVITY
AS
THE
OBJECT
APPROACHES
THE
EVENT
HORIZON
IT
HAS
FURTHER
TO
TRAVEL
INTEGRATING
THE
CURVE
GIVES
A
TIME
TO
REACH
THE
EVENT
HORIZON
OF
INFINITY
SO
THE
MATH
SAYS
THAT
NOTHING
CAN
ENTER
A
BLACK
HOLE
THIS
IS
NOT
CORRECT
THE
EVENT
HORIZON
IS
NOT
THE
CENTER
OF
THE
BLACK
HOLE
BUT
MERELY
THE
DISTANCE
AT
WHICH
THE
ESCAPE
VELOCITY
IS
EQUAL
TO
THE
SPEED
OF
LIGHT
THAT
IS
THE
EVENT
HORIZON
IS
A
FINITE
RADIUS
