re
a
kind
and
loving
god

malcolm
lee
writes
these
laws
written
for
the
israelites
gods
chosen
people
whom
god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
sorry
if
this
is
late
for
the
thread
but
i
thought
god
was
supposed
to
be
constant
and
neverchanging
how
do
you
reconcile
this
common
christian
view
with
the
paragraph
above
also
while
were
at
it
how
do
you
reconcile
a
kind
and
loving
god
with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
was
at
one
time
immediately
punishable
by
death
was
killing
people
for
sinning
gods
way
of
showing
kindness
and
love
is
the
fact
the
he
no
longer
does
this
an
admission
on
his
part
of
having
made
a
mistake
now
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
does
this
mean
that
for
our
sins
god
now
damns
us
to
eternal
hell
after
we
die
rather
than
killing
us
immediately
if
so
is
this
eternal
damnation
an
example
of
a
kind
and
loving
god
just
