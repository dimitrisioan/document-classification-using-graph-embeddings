CECIS
ROSICRUCIAN
ADVENTURE
HELLO
CECI
MY
NAME
IS
TONY
AND
I
HAVE
A
FEW
COMMENTS
ON
YOUR
ROSICRUCIAN
ADVENTURE
I
HEREBY
STATE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
CLAIMING
OR
DENYING
MEMBERSHIP
IN
ANY
ORDER
FRATERNITY
ETC
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
THE
WORD
ROSICRUCIAN
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
ORGANIZATION
I
ONLY
CLAIM
HAVING
DONE
SOME
HOMEWORK
THIS
IS
INTENDED
AS
A
FRIENDLY
ARTICLE
AND
IF
AT
TIMES
IT
SEEMS
DIFFERENT
ITS
MY
LACK
OF
WRITING
SKILLS
SHOWING
NOTHING
ELSE
HECK
ENGLISH
MAY
BE
MY
SECOND
LANGUAGE
AND
THEN
AGAIN
MAYBE
NOT
BY
NOW
I
PROCEED
I
HAD
AN
EHUM
INTERESTING
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THE
ROSICRUCIANS
OR
AT
LEAST
ROSICRUCIANS
OF
SOME
SORT
LAST
SUNDAY
LETS
START
WITH
THE
NAME
ROSICRUCIAN
I
TOOK
ME
A
LONG
TIME
TO
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
MEMBER
OF
A
ROSICRUCIAN
BODY
AND
BEING
A
ROSICRUCIAN
SO
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
MET
SOME
ROSICRUCIANS
YOU
MEAN
MEMBERS
OF
A
GROUP
THAT
CALLS
THEMSELVES
ROSICRUCIAN
AT
LEAST
THAT
IS
WHAT
YOUR
OBSERVATION
SUGGESTS
ID
PREFER
IF
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
STATED
UP
FRONT
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
LECTORIUM
ROSICRUCIANUM
ONLY
BECAUSE
THEY
MAY
BE
CONFUSED
BY
SOME
READERS
OF
THIS
NEWSGROUP
WITH
THE
ROSICRUCIAN
ORDER
AMORC
BASED
THE
USA
JURISDICTION
IN
SAN
JOSE
CA
THIS
BEING
THE
RC
ORG
WITH
THE
MOST
MEMBERS
LAST
TIME
I
LOOKED
OF
COURSE
MOST
MEMBERS
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
BEST
ANYWAY
THE
LECTORIUM
ROSICRUCIANUM
CLAIMS
THEY
DESCEND
AT
LEAST
IN
PART
FROM
WHAT
WAS
THE
GOLDUNDROSENKREUZ
GOLDEN
AND
ROSY
CROSS
FROM
THE
CENTURY
THERE
WERE
TWO
GOLDEN
AND
ROSY
CROSS
THE
FIRST
CHRONOLOGICALLY
MORE
ALCHEMICAL
THE
SECOND
WITH
MASONIC
TINGES
BUT
THEIR
HISTORY
IS
THE
SUBJECT
OF
A
COMPLETE
CHAPTER
YOULL
HAVE
TO
TRUST
ME
WHEN
I
TELL
YOU
THAT
IF
THAT
LECTURECLASSWHATEVER
HAD
BEEN
PRESENTED
BY
AMORC
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
THE
SAME
IMPRESSION
IE
YOUD
PROBABLY
HAVE
HAD
A
POSITIVE
IMPRESSION
MORE
LIKELY
THAN
A
NEGATIVE
ONE
IMHO
THE
FIRST
GUY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
THE
RS
ARE
A
MYSTICAL
CHRISTIAN
ORDER
AND
THAT
THEY
BASE
THEIR
TEACHINGS
ON
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
THE
KATHARS
ENGLISH
FROM
THE
THIRTEENTH
CENTURY
AGAIN
INSTEAD
OF
RS
IT
SHOULD
BE
LECTORIUM
ROSICRUCIANUM
IT
IS
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
THAT
OTHER
RC
ORDERS
IN
THE
USA
CLAIM
TO
BE
NON
SECTARIAN
THE
CATHARS
WERE
A
HERETIC
CHRISTIAN
SECT
THAT
DIRECTLY
CHALLENGED
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
MEDIEVAL
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
THEY
FLOURISHED
DURING
THE
CENTURY
CENTURY
WHICH
SAW
THE
RELIGIOUS
ZEAL
EXPRESSED
IN
THE
CRUSADES
AND
ALSO
THE
GROWING
DISILLUSION
WITH
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
AND
THE
WORLDLY
WAYS
OF
ITS
CLERICS
IT
WAS
LARGELY
IN
RESPONSE
TO
THE
CHURCHS
UNSEEMLY
POMP
AND
SPLENDOR
THAT
CATHARISM
TOOK
ROOT
FIRST
IN
NORTHERN
ITALY
THEN
THROUGHOUT
THE
SOUTH
OF
FRANCE
WHAT
MADE
ME
A
BIT
SUSPICIOUS
WAS
THE
WAY
THEY
FIRST
SAID
THAT
WE
ALL
CONTAINED
SOMETHING
DIVINE
AND
COULD
FIND
OUR
WAY
BACK
TO
DIVINITY
THEN
THAT
WE
COULDNT
BECOME
DIVINE
AS
THE
PERSONS
WE
ARE
CURRENTLY
BUT
IF
WE
WORKED
REALLY
HARD
WE
WOULD
REACH
ETERNAL
BLISS
I
DONT
SEE
NOTHING
FUNDAMENTALLY
WRONG
WITH
US
CONTAINING
SOMETHING
DIVINE
AND
YES
I
DONT
LIKE
PHRASES
LIKE
ETERNAL
BLISS
EITHER
HOW
TO
ROBOTIZE
PEOPLE
AND
BRAINWASH
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
THOUGHT
YOU
WERE
REFERRING
TO
MADISON
AVE
MADISON
AVENUE
IN
NEW
YORK
CITY
IS
WHERE
THE
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
READ
COMMERCIAL
ADVERTISING
IS
PRODUCED
HERE
IN
THE
USA
PEACE
TONY
BTW
I
HAVE
READ
THE
INTRO
LETTERS
OF
THE
LRC
WHICH
THEY
WILL
MAIL
YOU
FREE
OF
CHARGE
