math
exam
i
have
burden
of
proof
when
it
says
prove
that
no
elements
in
set
a
n
divided
by
leaves
as
a
remainder
n
prime
n
integer
does
exist
well
mathematics
is
formal
science
real
world
may
be
different
thing
but
if
entertainment
company
sell
computer
programs
saying
they
are
virus
safe
doesnt
they
have
burden
of
proof
that
viruses
dont
exist
in
their
floppies
i
dont
think
so
the
assumption
is
there
if
it
turns
out
that
their
software
has
a
virus
then
it
is
up
to
you
to
prove
that
fact
to
a
court
to
get
any
damages
you
are
theoretically
suppossed
to
be
able
to
get
damages
for
that
but
you
have
to
give
some
evidence
that
the
virus
came
from
that
software
but
since
the
computer
company
is
the
defendent
they
are
uninvolved
until
proven
guilty
