HUNTBACH
WRITES
SMA
REAL
CHRISTIAN
UNLESS
YOURE
BORN
AGAIN
IS
A
VERY
FUNDAMENTAL
BIBLICAL
SMCONVERSION
AND
REGENERATION
ARE
PROBABLY
PART
OF
SOME
SMALL
USABASED
CULT
THE
BORNAGAIN
TAG
OFTEN
USE
IT
TO
MEAN
VERY
SPECIFICALLY
HAVING
UNDERGONE
SOME
SORT
OF
ECSTATIC
EXPERIENCE
WHICH
CAN
IN
FACT
BE
VERY
EASILY
MANUFACTURED
WITH
A
LITTLE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
MANIPULATION
AND
ARE
OFTEN
INSULTINGLY
DISMISSIVE
OF
THOSE
WHOSE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
A
LITTLE
MORE
INTELLECTUAL
IS
NOT
THE
RESULT
SOME
OF
THESE
CULTS
WHICH
SEEMS
LIKE
A
RATHER
DISMISSIVE
TERM
TO
ME
ARE
PRETTY
BIG
HERE
IN
THE
USA
MOST
OF
THEM
ARE
QUITE
RESPECTABLE
NEIBORLY
DO
NOT
RESEMBLE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
IN
THE
LEAST
CONFUSING
THEM
IS
A
MISTAKE
WHAT
ABOUT
LIVE
LET
LIVE
FOLKS
IM
SURE
WE
CAN
UNCOVER
A
FEW
EXTREMIST
LOONIES
WHO
ARE
CATHOLIC
THE
ANTIABORTION
MOVEMENT
IN
THE
USA
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
A
FEW
HARD
CASES
IN
IT
FOR
EXAMPLE
IVE
OFTEN
HEARD
SUCH
PEOPLE
USE
THE
LINE
CATHOLICS
ARENT
REAL
CHRISTIANS
INDEED
ANYONE
SENDING
MISSIONARIES
TO
IRELAND
MUST
CERTAINLY
BE
TAKING
THIS
LINE
FOR
OTHERWISE
WHY
WOULD
THEY
NOT
BE
CONTENT
FOR
CHRISTIANITY
TO
BE
MAINTAINED
IN
IRELAND
IN
ITS
TRADITIONAL
CATHOLIC
FORM
I
HAVE
TO
AGREE
MATTHEW
WITH
THIS
I
HAVE
CERTAINLY
ENCOUNTERED
A
LOT
OF
ANTICATHOLICRELIGION
PROPAGANDA
EMOTION
SOME
BIGOTRY
FROM
MEMBERS
OF
CERTAIN
RELIGIOUS
GROUPS
HERE
THEY
ALSO
PRACTICE
THEIR
MISSIONARY
WORK
WITH
ZEAL
AMONG
CATHOLICS
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
BUT
TO
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
OR
WAS
RAISED
CATHOLIC
SUCH
RHETORIC
IS
PRETTY
OFFPUTTING
IT
MAY
WORK
BETTER
IN
AN
ENVIRONMENT
WHERE
THERES
A
LOT
OF
POPULAR
ANTICLERICALISM
FOLLOWUPS
SET
ELSEWHERE
THIS
NO
LONGER
SEEMS
VERY
RELEVANT
