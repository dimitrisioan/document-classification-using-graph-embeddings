COMMANDMENTS
I
THE
BASICS
WHY
SHOULD
ANYONE
CHECK
LETS
RESTRICT
THIS
TO
CHRISTIANS
WHY
DO
WE
WANT
TO
FIND
COMMANDMENTS
IN
THE
BOOKS
REGARDED
AS
SCRIPTURE
WHATS
GOING
ON
I
WILL
PASS
ON
PSYCHOLOGIZING
ANSWERS
WHETHER
DISMISSIVE
OR
MORE
OPEN
AS
NOT
THE
KIND
OF
ISSUE
TO
DEAL
WITH
HERE
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
THEOLOGICAL
POINT
INVOLVED
AND
IT
HAS
BEEN
QUOTED
AT
ME
OFTEN
ENOUGH
BY
THOSE
WHO
DONT
BELIEVE
I
TAKE
IT
SERIOUSLY
THAT
JESUS
IS
SAID
TO
HAVE
SAID
IF
YOU
LOVE
ME
YOU
WILL
OBEY
MY
COMMANDS
JOHN
I
AM
LIKE
ANY
CHRISTIAN
THE
SLAVE
OF
CHRIST
AND
IT
IS
MY
WILL
THAT
I
SHOULD
DO
AS
HE
WILLS
ME
TO
DO
I
AM
ALSO
OR
INSTEAD
HIS
YOUNGER
BROTHER
BUT
STILL
UNDER
HIS
DIRECTION
THOUGH
WE
BOTH
CALL
GOD
ABBA
CHRISTIANS
THEREFORE
WILL
TRY
TO
FIND
WHAT
IT
IS
THAT
THEIR
LORD
COMMANDS
THEM
AND
DISCOVERING
IT
WILL
FEEL
OBLIGATED
TO
DO
IT
OR
TO
CONFESS
THEIR
FAILURE
READERS
HERE
MAY
SET
ASIDE
THE
THEOLOGIZING
JARGON
SUCH
AS
SLAVES
OF
CHRIST
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
ADHERENTS
OF
A
RELIGION
WILL
READ
THE
TEXTS
WHETHER
CLASSIFIED
AS
INSPIRED
OR
NOT
THAT
ARE
HELD
UP
AS
MODELS
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
FIND
APPLICATION
TO
THEIR
OWN
SITUATIONS
THIS
PRACTICE
RANGES
FROM
DEVOTIONAL
READING
OF
SERMONS
AND
THE
LIKE
TO
THE
EXEGESIS
OF
CANON
ICAL
SCRIPTURE
AS
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
AT
THE
HIGHEST
PITCH
THIS
LEADS
TO
A
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
WE
CAN
FIND
IN
INSPIRED
SCRIPTURE
SOMETHING
THAT
CAN
ACT
AS
ABSOLUTE
GUIDANCE
FOR
OUR
ACTIONS
THE
PROBLEM
IS
IN
FINDING
OUT
JUST
WHAT
IT
IS
OUR
LORD
COMMANDS
I
AM
GOING
TO
SET
ASIDE
FOR
THIS
ESSAY
ONE
MAJOR
DIRECTION
IN
WHICH
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
LOOKED
FOR
THESE
COMMANDS
NAMELY
CHRISTIAN
TRADITION
THAT
IS
NOT
BECAUSE
I
REJECT
TRADITION
BUT
BECAUSE
MY
PRIMARY
AUDIENCE
IN
THIS
ESSAY
IS
PROTESTANTS
WHO
DENY
TRADITION
A
DETERMINATIVE
VALUE
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
WITNESS
OF
SCRIPTURE
THE
QUESTION
I
WANT
TO
DEAL
WITH
IS
WHAT
COMMANDMENTS
CAN
WE
FIND
FROM
OUR
LORD
IN
SCRIPTURE
AND
THAT
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
A
HARD
QUESTION
IF
ANY
OF
MY
PROTESTANT
INQUISITORS
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TURN
THE
DISCUSSION
TO
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
TRADITION
I
CAN
ACCOMODATE
THEM
UNLIKE
MOST
PROTESTANTS
EPISCOPALIANS
ADMIT
CLAIMS
FROM
A
SCRIPTURE
B
REASON
AND
C
TRADITION
ON
ROUGHLY
EQUAL
STANDING
EARLIER
IN
JOHN
THAN
MY
QUOTE
ABOVE
WE
READ
JOHN
I
GIVE
YOU
A
NEW
COMMANDMENT
LOVE
ONE
ANOTHER
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
PLACE
IN
THE
NT
WHERE
CHRISTIANS
ARE
GIVEN
AN
EXPLICIT
COMMANDMENT
WITH
THE
CONTEXT
COMMENTING
ON
ITS
IMPERATIVE
MODE
PRONOUNCEMENT
BY
JESUS
AT
THE
SAME
MEAL
SO
WE
READERS
INFER
SINCE
IT
IS
NOT
IN
JOHN
BUT
IN
THE
SYNOPTICS
JESUS
SAYS
TAKE
THIS
BREAD
THIS
IS
MY
BODY
MARK
CF
MATTHEW
LUKE
CORINTHIANS
THE
MODE
IS
IMPERATIVE
GREEK
LABETE
AND
HENCE
THIS
TOO
IS
A
COMMANDMENT
IN
BOTH
CASES
WE
HAVE
TO
INFER
THAT
THE
COMMAND
IS
DIRECTED
TO
A
WIDER
CIRCLE
THAN
THE
IMMEDIATE
COLLOCATION
OF
DISCIPLES
BECAUSE
WE
JUDGE
THE
EVANGELISTS
POINT
IN
MENTIONING
IT
WITH
THE
DISCIPLES
BY
THEN
MOSTLY
OR
ENTIRELY
DEAD
IS
THAT
WE
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
FOLLOW
THIS
AS
A
COMMANDMENT
FROM
OUR
LORD
IN
THE
CASE
OF
COMMUNION
PAULS
MENTION
AT
LEAST
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
TRUE
OF
THE
EVANGELISTS
ALSO
IMPLIES
AN
ONGOING
RITUAL
LITURGY
IN
WHICH
THESE
WORDS
OPERATE
TO
BIND
CHRISTIANS
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
COMMAND
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES
AS
A
CONTINUING
COMMANDMENT
TO
THE
CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY
I
AM
ENTIRELY
COMFORTABLE
WITH
THIS
INFERENCE
BUT
I
MUST
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
IS
THERE
BETWEEN
US
AND
THE
OCCASION
ON
WHICH
JESUS
SPOKE
THE
COMMAND
I
TAKE
IT
AS
A
CLEAR
INFERENCE
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
THE
EVANGELISTS
NOTION
THAT
ALL
CHRISTIANS
ARE
CALLED
TO
LOVE
ONE
ANOTHER
IN
JESUS
COMMAND
DIRECTED
AT
THE
DISCIPLES
BUT
I
HAVE
TO
CALL
ATTENTION
TO
THE
INFERENCE
THE
COMMAND
CANNOT
APPLY
TO
ME
WITHOUT
THE
GENERALIZATION
FROM
THE
SPECIFIC
CONTEXT
OF
ITS
STATEMENT
TO
MY
OWN
CONTEXT
AS
A
DISCIPLE
OF
CHRIST
ALL
READING
OF
SCRIPTURE
HAS
TO
MAKE
SUCH
INFERENCES
TO
GET
ANY
SENSE
OUT
OF
THE
TEXT
WHATSOEVER
THIS
IS
A
GENERAL
PROBLEM
IN
READING
THESE
TEXTS
WE
CANNOT
READ
THEM
AT
ALL
WITHOUT
OUR
OWN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
OUR
NATIVE
LANGUAGES
IN
WHICH
WE
NORMALLY
READ
THE
TRANSLATED
TEXTS
AND
WITHOUT
SOME
APPRECIATION
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
CONTEXT
AND
AT
POINTS
THE
ORIGINAL
LANGUAGES
WHEN
ENGLISH
MISLEADS
US
I
AM
GOING
TO
PRESUME
IN
WHAT
FOLLOWS
THAT
WE
HAVE
THE
GENERAL
PROBLEM
OF
HOW
TO
READ
SCRIPTURE
UNDER
CONTROL
I
DONT
REALLY
THINK
THIS
IS
TRUE
BUT
IT
WILL
SUFFICE
FOR
MY
CURRENT
PURPOSES
I
WILL
ADDRESS
ONLY
THE
ISSUES
THAT
ARISE
WHEN
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
COPED
WITH
THE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
A
YEAR
OLD
TEXT
FROM
ANOTHER
WORLD
THAN
THE
ONE
WE
LIVE
IN
QUESTIONS
AT
THAT
LEVEL
ONLY
INTRODUCE
MORE
RESER
VATIONS
ABOUT
THE
COMMANDMENTS
ISSUE
THAN
WILL
BE
FOUND
STIPULATING
THAT
WE
CAN
READ
THE
TEXTS
AS
THE
ORIGINAL
AUDIENCE
MIGHT
HAVE
DONE
AMONG
THE
REASONS
WE
HAVE
FOR
SEEING
JOHNS
AGAPATE
ALLELOU
AS
A
GENERAL
COMMANDMENT
NOT
MERELY
AN
INSTRUCTION
BY
JESUS
TO
THIS
DISCIPLES
ON
THAT
ONE
OCCASION
AND
ONE
LINKING
IT
TO
THE
SYNOPTIC
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
IS
THAT
WE
HAVE
CRITICISM
FROM
JESUS
ABOUT
LIMITING
OUR
LOVE
TO
THOSE
WHOM
WE
CONGENIALLY
ASSOCIATE
WITH
IN
MATTHEW
WE
READ
YOU
HAVE
LEARNT
HOW
IT
WAS
SAID
YOU
MUST
LOVE
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
AND
HATE
YOUR
ENEMY
BUT
I
SAY
TO
YOU
LOVE
YOUR
ENEMIES
IN
FACT
THE
LEVITICUS
CONTEXT
QUOTED
DOES
NOT
SAY
HATE
YOUR
ENEMY
IT
IS
MERELY
THE
COMMON
HUMAN
PRESUMPTION
AND
LEVITICUS
IS
AT
PAINS
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
LOVE
SHOULD
EXTEND
TO
STRANGERS
AMONGST
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
LUKE
IN
EXPANDING
ON
THIS
SAME
Q
CONTEXT
GOES
ON
TO
HAVE
JESUS
SAY
EVEN
SINNERS
LOVE
THOSE
WHO
LOVE
THEM
ALL
OF
THIS
SUGGESTS
QUITE
STRONGLY
ID
SAY
THAT
LIMITING
THE
SCOPE
OF
THE
NEW
COMMANDMENT
IS
NOT
QUITE
WHAT
JESUS
HAS
IN
MIND
IN
SHORT
INFERENCE
LEADS
ME
TO
GENERALIZING
THE
ACTUAL
TEXT
TO
A
COMMAND
THAT
IS
IN
FORCE
ON
CHRISTIANS
AND
WITH
OBJECTS
NOT
LIMITED
TO
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
TRICKIER
THAN
THE
AGAPATE
ALLELOU
OR
INSTITUTION
OF
COMMUNION
THERE
IS
THE
CASE
OF
THE
GREAT
COMMISSION
WHERE
MATTHEW
MARK
THE
TWELVE
ARE
SENT
OUT
TO
EVANGELIZE
PROCLAIM
THAT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
CLOSE
AT
HAND
THE
VERB
IS
IMPERATIVE
KERUSSETE
BUT
THE
CONTEXT
IS
RATHER
SPECIFIC
TO
THE
TWELVE
AND
THERE
ARE
FURTHER
SPECIFIERS
AS
IN
DO
NOT
TURN
YOUR
STEPS
TO
PAGAN
TERRITORY
AND
DO
NOT
ENTER
ANY
SAMARITAN
TOWN
THE
LUKAN
PARALLELS
ARE
EVEN
MORE
SPECIFIC
TO
JESUS
FINAL
JOURNEY
TO
JERUSALEM
WHICH
MAKE
IT
HARDER
TO
SEE
THIS
GENERALIZING
TO
ALL
CHRISTIANS
THAN
THE
PREVIOUS
EXAMPLES
THAT
HASNT
PREVENTED
CHRISTIANS
FROM
MAKING
SUCH
AN
INFERENCE
WHAT
I
HAVE
TO
CALL
ATTENTION
TO
IS
THAT
SUCH
INFERENCE
IS
NOT
JUSTIFIED
IN
THE
TEXT
NOR
UNLIKE
THE
FIRST
TWO
CASES
I
CITE
BY
THE
RHETORIC
OF
THE
EVANGELIST
URGED
ON
THE
READER
STILL
PAUL
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
FELT
OBLIGED
TO
PROCLAIM
THAT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
CLOSE
AT
HAND
EVEN
CONTRARY
TO
JESUS
INSTRUCTIONS
TO
THE
TO
THE
GENTILES
TO
THE
ENDS
OF
THE
EARTH
SO
CHRISTIANS
AFTER
HIM
HAVE
ALSO
TAKEN
THIS
AS
A
COMMANDMENT
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
JOHN
DO
I
ACCEPT
THIS
I
DONT
KNOW
IT
IS
SURELY
RATHER
SPECULATIVE
BUT
YOU
SEE
HOW
THE
RIPPLES
OF
INFERENCE
SPREAD
OUT
FROM
THE
TEXT
THAT
IS
THE
PRETEXT
CHRISTIANS
MAY
INFER
A
GENERAL
COMMANDMENT
APPLICABLE
TO
ALL
FROM
WHAT
IS
PRESENTED
IN
THE
GOSPELS
AS
A
SPECIFIC
OCCASION
I
DO
NOT
NECESSARILY
OBJECT
TO
THIS
KIND
OF
GENERALIZATION
BUT
I
INSIST
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO
MAKE
IT
MUST
HAVE
AN
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THEY
ARE
REASONING
AT
SOME
CONSIDERABLE
LENGTH
FROM
WHAT
WE
ACTUALLY
HAVE
IN
SCRIPTURE
THERE
ARE
ASSUMPTIONS
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
REASONING
AND
THESE
ARE
NOT
THEMSELVES
SCRIPTURAL
THOUGH
PEOPLE
WILL
DO
THEIR
BEST
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
ASSUMPTIONS
BY
OTHER
REFERENCES
TO
SCRIPTURE
WHICH
SIMPLY
ADDS
MORE
INFERENCE
INTO
THE
MIX
LETS
MOVE
ON
TO
THE
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
THAT
WE
SHOULD
LOVE
GOD
WITH
OUR
WHOLE
HEARTS
AND
MINDS
AND
SOULS
THIS
IS
PERHAPS
THE
SYNOPTIC
EQUIVALENT
OF
JOHNS
AGAPATE
ALLELOU
AND
YET
IT
IS
NOT
PRESENTED
AS
A
COMMANDMENT
IN
OUR
TEXTS
RATHER
THE
CONTEXT
IS
CONTROVERSY
WITH
THE
PHARISEES
TO
CITE
MATTHEW
BUT
WHEN
THE
PHARISEES
HEARD
THAT
HE
HAD
SILENCED
THE
SADDUCEES
THEY
GOT
TOGETHER
AND
TO
DISCONCERT
HIM
ONE
OF
THEM
PUT
A
QUESTION
MASTER
WHICH
IS
THE
GREATEST
COMMANDMENT
OF
THE
LAW
IT
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
OBVIOUS
HERE
THOUGH
I
ACCEPT
IT
AS
SUCH
THAT
JESUS
ANSWER
IS
MEANT
TO
BE
A
COMMANDMENT
TO
CHRISTIANS
HE
IS
ANSWERING
A
POLEMIC
FROM
HIS
ENEMIES
MARKS
ACCOUNT
IN
CASTS
THE
ANSWER
IN
A
FAR
MORE
POSITIVE
LIGHT
AS
SO
THE
SCRIBE
IN
THIS
VERSION
SAYS
FAR
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
ANY
HOLOCAUST
I
NEED
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THIS
WORD
ORIGINATES
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
ANIMAL
SACRIFICE
FORGET
THE
NAZIS
FOR
THIS
OR
SACRIFICE
LUKE
IS
INTERMEDIATE
HE
HAS
A
LAWYER
POSING
THE
QUESTION
TO
DISCONCERT
JESUS
AND
GETS
THE
GOOD
SAMARIAN
PARABLE
FOR
HIS
PAINS
LUKE
THE
CONTEXTS
HERE
ARE
SO
CONFUSINGLY
VARIOUS
THAT
ONE
COULD
BE
FORGIVEN
FOR
DRAWING
NO
INFERENCES
IN
NO
ACCOUNT
IS
THIS
SAID
AS
IF
IT
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
TO
BE
TAKEN
AS
A
COMMANDMENT
BINDING
ON
CHRISTIANS
THOUGH
I
THINK
IT
AN
ENTIRELY
REASONABLE
CONCLUSION
IN
EACH
CASE
THAT
JESUS
THINKS
IT
TO
BE
SO
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
OUR
MENTAL
GEARS
HAVE
TO
GRIND
A
CYCLE
OR
SO
TO
GET
TO
ANY
CONCLUSION
FROM
ALL
OF
THIS
ABOUT
WHAT
WE
ARE
COMMANDED
TO
DO
BY
JESUS
AND
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
CONTINGENT
ON
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
THE
POINT
OF
JESUS
USE
OF
THE
TORAH
IN
THE
ALL
QUITE
DIFFERENT
GOSPEL
ACCOUNTS
AND
THE
APPLICATION
OF
SUCH
A
CONTEXT
TO
US
THE
DIFFERENT
CONTEXTS
AMONG
THE
SYNOPTICS
ARE
CURIOUS
IT
SHOULD
BE
NOTED
THAT
ONLY
IN
LUKE
DO
WE
GET
THE
FIXING
OF
THIS
COMMAND
BY
THE
PARABLE
OF
THE
GOOD
SAMARITAN
WE
MAY
LOOK
FOR
AN
ANALOGOUS
INTENT
IN
MATTHEW
WHERE
GIVES
THE
GOLDEN
RULE
AS
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
LAW
AND
THE
PROPHETS
AND
WHERE
WE
MAY
ALSO
HEAR
AN
ECHO
OF
HILLEL
SAYING
THE
SAME
A
GENERATION
BEFORE
JESUS
IF
WE
MAKE
THESE
ASSOCIATIONS
WHICH
I
THINK
ARE
ENTIRELY
REASONABLE
WE
ARE
AGAIN
INDULGING
IN
INFERENCE
THE
TEXTS
DO
NOT
EXPLICITLY
SUPPORT
US
RATHER
WE
READ
THE
TEXTS
AS
HAVING
THIS
KIND
OF
INTERRELATIONSHIP
CURRENT
LITERARY
THEORY
CALLS
THIS
INTERTEXTUALITY
MY
DISCUSSION
OF
WHY
THE
AGAPATE
ALLELOU
HAS
TO
APPLY
BEYOND
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
AND
BEYOUND
THE
CIRCLE
OF
CHRISTIAN
BELIEVERS
APPLIES
AGAIN
HERE
TO
BUTTRESS
A
CONCLUSION
THAT
THIS
IS
DESPITE
THE
PRESENTATION
NOT
SAYING
SO
EXPLICITLY
A
COMMANDMENT
TO
CHRISTIANS
FEW
CHRISTIANS
WOULD
DISAGREE
WITH
MY
CONCLUSIONS
BUT
I
MUST
POINT
OUT
THAT
THEY
ARE
CONCLUSIONS
THEY
DEPEND
ON
RATHER
ELABORATE
CHAINS
OF
REASONING
THAT
ARE
SIMPLY
NOT
PRESENT
IN
THE
TEXTS
THEMSELVES
THE
CONTEXTUAL
PROBLEM
KEEPS
COMING
UP
MORE
AND
MORE
SEVERELY
AS
WE
LOOK
AT
THOSE
SAYINGS
OF
JESUS
THAT
ARE
NOT
SO
UNIVERSALLY
TAKEN
BY
CHRISTIANS
AS
COMMANDMENTS
AND
WE
GET
SOME
REALLY
HARD
CASES
TAKE
DIVORCE
MARK
IS
PRETTY
CLEAR
THE
MAN
WHO
DIVORCES
HIS
WIFE
AND
MARRIES
ANOTHER
IS
GUILTY
OF
ADULTERY
AGAINST
HER
CF
LUKE
EXCEPT
THAT
MATTHEW
HAS
AN
ESCAPE
CLAUSE
EXCEPT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
FORNICATION
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
RATHER
CLEAR
COMMANDMENT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
TAKE
MATTHEWS
RESERVATION
AND
SOME
CHRISTIANS
TO
THIS
DAY
TAKE
IT
SO
BUT
SOME
DONT
AT
LEAST
IN
PRACTICE
THIS
IS
RATHER
PECULIAR
IT
IS
NOT
AS
IF
JESUS
WERE
NOT
EXPLICIT
ABOUT
THIS
WHEREAS
HE
SAYS
NOTHING
AT
ALL
ABOUT
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
PEOPLE
GNASH
THEIR
TEETH
OVER
HOW
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
IF
THE
COMMANDS
OF
CHRIST
ARE
CLEAR
THAT
MATTHEW
CAN
SO
DISAGREE
WITH
THE
OTHER
EVANGELISTS
OF
THE
SYNOPTIC
TRADITION
IM
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
THIS
EXAMINATION
INTO
EVERMURKIER
WATERS
BUT
THIS
IS
ENOUGH
TO
START
WITH
THE
THEME
IS
FINDING
COMMANDMENTS
IN
SCRIPTURE
IS
AN
EXERCISE
IN
INFERENCE
OUR
INFERENCES
ARE
INFORMED
BY
OUR
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT
IS
OUR
OWN
CULTURAL
BIASES
I
HAVE
SO
FAR
IDENTIFIED
A
VERY
FEW
COMMANDMENTS
THAT
ARE
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
BY
ALL
CHRISTIANS
AND
YET
IN
THESE
ALREADY
SOME
OF
THE
DIFFICULTIES
START
TO
SURFACE
IT
IS
THESE
DIFFICULTIES
I
WANT
TO
DISCUSS
IN
MY
NEXT
ESSAY
ON
THIS
TOPIC
THE
DIVORCE
COMMANDMENT
ALREADY
STRIKES
AT
SOME
OF
THE
DIFFICULTIES
I
SEE
ALMOST
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
SO
EAGER
TO
FIND
COMMANDMENTS
TO
CONDEMN
ME
WITH
SPEND
ANY
TIME
AT
ALL
WRITING
NASTY
SCREEDS
TO
SOCCOUPLES
OR
MISCLEGAL
ABOUT
THE
HORRORS
OR
VICIOUSNESS
OF
DIVORCE
OR
DEMANDING
THAT
US
LAW
REFUSE
TO
ALLOW
IT
OR
REFUSE
UNREPENTANT
DIVORCEES
PLACES
IN
THEIR
CHURCHES
THAT
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
DIVORCE
DOESNT
ENTER
INTO
CONSIDERATION
IN
GENERAL
IT
IS
MOST
DEFINITELY
A
MATTER
OF
CONCERN
IN
EVEN
THE
MOST
LIBERAL
CHURCH
CIRCLES
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
WILDLY
LIBERAL
EPISCOPALIAN
PRIEST
OF
MY
AQAUINTENCE
IN
A
WILDLY
LIBERAL
DIOCESE
HAS
RECOMMENDED
TO
A
COUPLE
WHO
APPROACHED
HIM
TO
MARRY
THEM
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
PRIVATE
SECULAR
CEREMONY
BEFORE
A
JUDGE
SO
THAT
THE
PUBLIC
CEREMONY
HE
CELEBRATED
NEED
NOT
GO
THROUGH
AN
AGONIZING
EXAMINATION
BY
OFFICIALS
WHO
WOULD
JUST
AS
SOON
NOT
TAKE
ON
THIS
ROLE
OF
INTERPRETING
THE
COMMANDS
WE
ARE
FACED
WITH
AS
CHRISTIANS
THIS
IN
A
CHURCH
THAT
WAS
EFFECTIVELY
CREATED
BY
A
FAMOUS
DIVORCE
