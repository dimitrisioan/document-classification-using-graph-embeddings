RELIGION
AND
MARRIAGE
I
WASNT
SURE
IF
THIS
WAS
THE
RIGHT
NEWSGROUP
TO
POST
THIS
TO
BUT
I
GUESS
THE
MISC
IS
THERE
FOR
A
REASON
HERE
GOES
I
AM
GETTING
MARRIED
IN
JUNE
TO
A
DEVOUT
WISCONSIN
SYNOD
LUTHERAN
I
WOULD
CLASSIFY
MYSELF
AS
A
STRONG
AGNOSTICWEAK
ATHIEST
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
A
SUBJECT
OF
MANY
DISCUSSIONS
BETWEEN
US
AND
IS
REALLY
OUR
ONLY
REAL
OBSTACLE
WE
DONT
HAVE
ANY
REAL
DIFFICULTIES
WITH
THE
RELIGIOUS
DIFFERENCES
YET
BUT
I
EXPECT
THEY
WILL
POP
UP
WHEN
WE
HAVE
CHILDREN
I
HAVE
AGREED
TO
RAISE
THE
CHILDREN
NOMINALLY
LUTHERAN
THAT
IS
LUTHERAN
TRADITIONS
BUT
TRYING
TO
KEEP
AN
OPEN
MIND
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
EVEN
POSSIBLE
THOUGH
I
FEEL
THAT
THAT
THE
WORST
QUALITY
OF
BEING
DEVOUTLY
RELIGOUS
IS
THE
LACK
OF
AN
OPEN
MIND
ANYWAY
I
GUESS
ILL
GET
ON
WITH
MY
QUESTION
IS
ANYONE
IN
THE
SAME
SITUATION
AND
CAN
GIVE
SOME
SUGGESTIONS
AS
TO
HOW
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
WEVE
TAKEN
THE
ATTITUDE
SO
FAR
OF
JUST
TALKING
ABOUT
IT
A
LOT
AND
NOT
LETTING
ANYTHING
GET
BOTTLED
UP
INSIDE
SOMETIMES
I
GET
THE
FEELING
WERE
MAKING
THIS
MUCH
BIGGER
THAN
IT
ACTUALLY
IS
ANY
COMMENTS
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
ALSO
PLEASE
EMAIL
RESPONSES
SINCE
I
DONT
GET
A
CHANCE
TO
READ
THIS
GROUP
OFTEN
PAUL
