RE
QUESTION
FOR
THOSE
WITH
POPULAR
MORALITY
HUDSON
THESE
PEOPLE
HURT
THEIR
OWN
BODIES
WHY
CANT
THEY
HURT
OTHER
PEOPLES
BODIES
TOO
ME
BECAUSE
OTHER
PEOPLE
MIGHT
NOT
WANT
TO
BE
HURT
HUDSON
AND
HURTING
THEM
AGAINST
THEIR
WILL
IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
CHOICE
HUDSON
SO
WHY
IS
SOMEONE
ELSES
WILL
SUCH
A
BIG
DEAL
IF
MORALITY
IS
ALL
RELATIVE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
I
EVER
SAID
THAT
MORALITY
WAS
ALL
RELATIVE
WHAT
I
SAID
WAS
THAT
I
CAN
MAKE
MY
MIND
UP
ON
MY
OWN
THANK
YOU
AND
THAT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
TELL
OTHERS
WHAT
TO
THINK
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
IN
MOST
MORAL
SYSTEMS
THERE
IS
A
RESPECT
FOR
HUMAN
LIFE
AND
THE
DIGNITY
OF
THE
PERSON
IT
IS
ALL
THE
STUFF
BESIDES
THESE
POINTS
THAT
FORMS
THE
CORE
OF
THE
DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN
PRIMITIVE
MORAL
ABSOLUTISTS
LIKE
YOURSELF
AND
THE
REST
OF
US
HUDSON
MAYBE
THE
INSANE
LOVER
OF
PAIN
MIGHT
REASON
IF
OTHER
PEOPLE
EXPERIENCED
ENOUGH
PAIN
THEY
MIGHT
LEARN
TO
ENJOY
IT
TOO
FINE
THERE
IS
STILL
THE
CLINICAL
DEFINITION
OF
CRAZY
AND
THIS
ALSO
INVOLVES
A
VIOLATION
OF
FREE
WILL
BECAUSE
THE
INSANE
LOVER
OF
YOUR
LITTLE
EXAMPLE
WOULD
BE
INFLICTING
PAIN
ON
A
NONWILLING
SUBJECT
TRY
AGAIN
HUDSON
YOU
HAVE
TO
HAVE
OTHER
PREMISES
TO
DERIVE
THIS
ME
NO
YOU
DONT
THAT
IS
A
PATENTLY
FALSE
STATEMENT
HUDSON
YOU
HAVE
TO
HAVE
SOME
SORT
OF
PREMISE
ABOUT
CHOICE
OR
SELFAWARENESS
NO
YOU
DO
NOT
I
DEMONSTRATED
TO
YOU
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
FOOTBALL
TEAM
WHICH
DOESNT
REQUIRE
PREMISES
ABOUT
FREEDOM
OF
CHOICE
OR
SENTIENCESELFAWARENESS
AS
I
SAID
YOU
ARE
WRONG
AND
YOU
DONT
SEEM
TO
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
MORAL
SYSTEMS
IF
I
WERE
YOU
I
WOULD
TAKE
DAVID
BOLDS
SUGGESTION
AND
DO
SOME
READING
ON
THE
SUBJECT
BEFORE
YOU
TRY
PREACHING
ABOUT
IT
