RE
AFTER
YEARS
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY
IS
IN
ARTICLE

MARK
PUNDURS
WRITES
ATOMS
ARE
NOT
OBJECTIVE
THEY
ARENT
EVEN
REAL
WHAT
SCIENTISTS
CALL
AN
ATOM
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
MATHEMATICAL
MODEL
THAT
DESCRIBES
CERTAIN
PHYSICAL
OBSERVABLE
PROPERTIES
OF
OUR
SURROUNDINGS
ALL
OF
WHICH
IS
SUBJECTIVE
OMIGOD
ITS
AN
OPERATIONALIST
SORRY
JIM
BUT
THE
IDEA
THAT
A
THEORY
EXPLAINING
A
MYRIAD
OF
DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT
OBSERVATIONS
IS
MERELY
A
MODEL
IS
MORE
THAN
SENSIBLE
PEOPLE
CAN
ACCEPT
YOUR
PHOBIA
ABOUT
OBJECTIVE
REALITY
NOTWITHSTANDING
THE
POINT
ABOUT
ITS
BEING
REAL
OR
NOT
IS
THAT
ONE
DOES
NOT
WASTE
TIME
WITH
WHAT
REALITY
MIGHT
BE
WHEN
ONE
WANTS
PREDICTIONS
THE
QUESTIONS
IF
THE
ATOMS
ARE
THERE
OR
IF
SOMETHING
ELSE
IS
THERE
MAKING
MEASUREMENTS
INDICATE
ATOMS
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
IN
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
AND
ONE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
WRITE
A
NEW
THEORY
OF
EXISTENCE
EVERYTIME
NEW
MODELS
ARE
USED
IN
PHYSICS
DONT
FORGET
TO
PROVE
YOUR
LAST
SENTENCE
NAMELY
THAT
SENSIBLE
DONT
ACCEPT
THAT
BENEDIKT
