bad
thoughts
these
well
it
depends
on
whether
you
take
the
literal
dictionary
definition
of
cult
and
say
all
faiths
are
cults
or
if
you
take
a
more
socialcontext
view
of
cult
which
allows
you
to
recognize
mainstream
religions
as
sociallyacceptable
and
cults
as
groups
that
involve
techniques
of
brain
washing
and
all
the
other
characteristics
that
define
oppressive
probly
not
the
best
word
cult
behaviour
yeah
but
implicitly
the
socialcontext
view
provides
a
justification
for
the
dictionary
definition
of
a
cult
those
who
follow
the
mainstream
pretend
while
those
in
cults
act
based
on
the
very
same
impulses
now
who
is
to
be
taken
seriously
im
confused
could
you
restate
what
yer
saying
in
those
who
follow
the
mainstream
pretend
and
act
based
on
the
very
same
impulses
