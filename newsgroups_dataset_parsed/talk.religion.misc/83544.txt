KEVIN
OSINSKI
WRITES
I
RECALL
READING
IN
MICHAEL
RUTHERFORDS
NOVEL
SARUM
A
SCENE
IN
WHICH
THE
SON
OF
A
ROMAN
NOBLEMAN
LIVING
IN
BRITAIN
TAKES
PART
IN
A
SECRET
CEREMONY
INVOLVING
A
BULL
HE
STANDS
NAKED
IN
A
PIT
COVERED
WITH
SOME
SORT
OF
SCAFFOLDING
WHILE
ASSISTANTS
COAX
A
BULL
TO
STAND
ON
THE
SCAFFOLDING
THEY
THEN
FATALLY
STAB
THE
BULL
WHICH
DOUSES
THE
WORSHIPPER
IN
THE
PIT
WITH
BLOOD
THIS
IS
SUPPOSEDLY
SOME
SORT
OF
RITE
OF
PASSAGE
FOR
MEMBERS
OF
THE
BULL
CULT
I
WONDER
IF
THIS
IS
RELATED
TO
THE
MITHRAS
CULT
YES
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
ONE
OF
THE
TRADITIONAL
IDEAS
ABOUT
THE
MITHRAIC
CULT
ALTHOUGH
NOT
THE
ONLY
ONE
IT
HAD
MANY
ELEMENTS
THAT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
BORROWED
BY
CATHOLICISM
EG
THE
MASS
COMMUNION
THE
SHARING
OF
A
SACRED
MEAL
CONSECRATION
OF
BREAD
AND
WINE
ETC
FOR
QUITE
AN
AMUSING
NOVEL
THAT
USES
THIS
SAME
IDEA
CHECK
OUT
THE
COVENANT
OF
THE
FLAME
BY
DAVID
MORRELL
IT
HAS
SOME
QUITE
INTERESTING
OCCULT
BITS
AND
LOTS
OF
KILLING
I
WONT
SPOIL
IT
BY
REVEALING
THE
ENDING
BUT
I
WILL
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
RELEVANT
TO
MITHRAISM
