writes
leviticus
and
the
daughter
of
any
priest
if
she
profane
herself
by
playing
the
whore
she
profaneth
her
father
she
shall
be
burnt
with
fire
deuteronomy
and
the
tokens
of
virginity
be
not
found
for
the
damsel
then
they
shall
bring
out
the
damsel
to
the
door
of
her
fathers
house
and
the
men
of
the
city
shall
stone
her
with
stones
that
she
die
deuteronomy
if
a
man
be
found
lying
with
a
woman
married
to
a
husband
then
they
shall
both
of
them
die
deuteronomy
if
a
damsel
that
is
a
virgin
be
betrothed
unto
a
husband
and
a
man
find
her
in
the
city
and
lie
with
her
then
ye
shall
bring
them
both
out
unto
the
gate
of
that
city
and
ye
shall
stone
them
with
stones
that
they
die
deuteronomy
but
if
a
man
find
a
betrothed
damsel
in
the
field
and
the
man
force
her
and
lie
with
her
then
the
man
only
that
lay
with
her
shall
die
if
it
werent
for
the
sin
of
men
none
of
this
killing
would
have
been
necesarry
he
is
kind
and
loving
but
also
righteous
sin
must
be
punished
before
jesus
man
had
to
take
the
sins
on
himself
but
jesus
died
and
took
it
all
upon
him
so
now
we
also
have
a
forgiving
god
if
he
were
not
kind
and
loving
there
wouldnt
have
been
any
people
left
