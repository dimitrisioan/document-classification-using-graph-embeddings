ISAAC
KUO
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
GOYKHMANAPOLLOHPCOM
RED
HERRING
WRITES
THE
FBI
CLAIMS
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THEIR
INTELLIGENCE
REPORTS
THAT
BDS
HAD
NO
PLANS
TO
COMMIT
SUECIDE
THEY
BTW
HAD
BUGGED
THE
PLACE
AND
WERE
LISTENING
TO
BDS
CONVERSATIONS
TILL
THE
VERY
END
KORESHS
ATTORNEY
CLAIMS
THAT
BASED
ON
SOME
HOURS
HE
SPENT
TALKING
TO
HIS
CLIENT
AND
OTHERS
IN
THE
COMPOUND
HE
SAW
NO
INDICATION
THAT
BDS
WERE
CONTEMPLATING
SUECIDE
THE
SURVIVORS
CLAIM
IT
WAS
NOT
A
SUECIDE
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
THAT
MORE
THAN
ONE
OF
THE
SURVIVORS
MADE
THIS
CLAIM
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THE
SURVIVORS
MADE
THE
CONTRADICTORY
CLAIM
THAT
BD
MEMBERS
HAD
STARTED
THE
FIRE
NO
THIS
IS
FAR
FROM
CLEAR
WE
ONLY
HAVE
THE
WORD
OF
THE
FBI
SPOKEPEOPLE
THAT
A
SURVIVOR
MADE
THIS
CLAIM
WE
HAVE
THE
CONTRADICTORY
WORD
OF
THE
LAWYERS
WHO
SPOKE
WITH
THE
SURVIVORS
INDIVIDUALLY
THAT
ALL
OF
THEM
AGREED
THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
HAVE
A
SUICIDE
PACT
AND
DID
NOT
INTENTIONALLY
START
THE
FIRE
IN
THE
ABSENSE
OF
ANY
MORE
EVIDENCE
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
WE
CAN
DECIDE
WHO
TO
BELIEVE
FURTHERMORE
ITS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
GENERAL
SUICIDE
PACT
AND
THAT
SOME
SMALL
INNER
CIRCLE
TOOK
IT
UPON
THEMSELVES
TO
KILL
EVERYONE
ELSE
WITH
THE
STATE
OF
THE
AREA
NOW
WE
MAY
NEVER
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
BDS
WERE
NOT
CONTEMPLATING
SUECIDE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THEY
COMMITTED
ONE
NO
REASON
HOW
ABOUT
THESE
TWO
SOME
OF
THE
SURVIVORS
CLAIMED
THAT
BD
MEMBERS
POURED
FUEL
ALONG
THE
CORRIDORS
AND
SET
FIRE
TO
IT
THE
SPEED
AT
WHICH
THE
FIRE
SPREAD
IS
NOT
INCONSISTENT
WITH
THIS
CLAIM
AGAIN
WE
HAVE
ONLY
THE
WORD
OF
THE
FBI
ON
THIS
CLAIM
THE
LAWYERS
WHO
HAVE
ALSO
TALKED
TO
THE
SURVORS
DENY
THAT
ANY
OF
THEM
ARE
MAKING
THAT
CLAIM
THERE
WAS
CERTAINLY
A
FIRE
WHICH
KILLED
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
THERE
IS
A
VERY
VERY
GOOD
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THE
FBI
DID
NOT
START
THIS
FIRE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BDS
DID
I
WILL
AGREE
ON
YOUR
ASSESSMENT
AS
TO
THE
RELATIVE
PROBABILITIES
ITS
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
THE
BDS
STARTED
THE
FIRE
THAN
DID
THE
FBI
BUT
THERE
IS
CURRENTLY
NO
WAY
TO
DECIDE
WHAT
ACTUALLY
HAPPENED
BASED
ON
THE
PUBLICALLY
AVAILABLE
EVIDENCE
WHICH
IS
NEARLY
NONE
EVEN
IF
THE
BDS
WERE
NOT
CONTEMPLATING
SUICIDE
IT
IS
VERY
POSSIBLE
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
CONVINCED
AND
THUS
CONVINCED
THE
OTHERS
THAT
THIS
WAS
NOT
SUICIDE
IT
WAS
THE
FULFILMENT
OF
A
PROFECY
OF
SOME
SORT
THERE
ARE
THREE
POSSIBILITIES
OTHER
THAN
THE
BDS
SELF
DESTRUCTION
A
THEY
ARE
NOT
DEAD
BUT
ESCAPED
VIA
BUNKERETC
FROM
REPORTS
OF
THE
INADEQUACIES
OF
THE
TUNNELS
AND
THE
BODIES
FOUND
I
WOULD
RATE
THIS
AS
HIGHLY
UNLIKELY
B
THE
FIRE
WAS
STARTED
BY
AN
FBI
ACCIDENT
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
FOOLISH
OF
US
TO
DECLARE
THIS
OUTRIGHT
UNTIL
MORE
EVIDENCE
CAN
BACK
IT
SURE
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
ARMORED
VEHICLE
KNOCKED
DOWN
A
LANTERN
WHICH
STARTED
THE
FIRE
WHY
WAS
THERE
A
LIT
LANTERN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
DAY
NEAR
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
COMPLEX
ITS
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
CONTRADICTED
BY
OTHER
ESCAPEES
C
THE
FIRE
WAS
STARTED
ON
PURPOSE
BY
THE
FBI
THIS
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
BY
SOME
ON
THE
NET
AND
I
WOULD
RATE
THIS
POSSIBILITY
AS
UTTERLY
LUDICROUS
THIS
IS
WHAT
WE
IN
SCISKEPTIC
WOULD
CALL
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
CLAIM
AND
WONT
BOTHER
REFUTING
UNLESS
SOMEONE
GIVES
ANY
GOOD
EVIDENCE
TO
BACK
IT
UP
D
THE
FIRE
WAS
AN
STARTED
ACCIDENTALLY
BY
THE
BDS
I
AM
TRUELY
AMAZED
THAT
I
HAVE
HEARD
OR
READ
OF
NO
ONE
SUGGESTING
THIS
POSSIBILITY
WITH
ALL
THE
TEAR
GAS
AND
THE
LACK
OF
ELECTICAL
POWER
IN
THE
COMPOUND
AND
THE
ADULTS
WEARING
GAS
MASKS
IT
HAD
TO
HAVE
BEEN
CHAOTIC
INSIDE
I
CAN
EASILY
IMAGE
SOMEONE
LEAVING
A
LAMP
TOO
CLOSE
TO
SOMETHING
OR
ACCIDENTALLY
DROPPING
A
LAMP
OR
KNOCKING
ONE
OVER
WITH
THE
WINDS
IT
WOULD
HAVE
QUICKLY
GOTTEN
OUT
OF
CONTROL
SO
WE
ARE
LEFT
WITH
TWO
REASONABLE
POSSIBILITIES
THAT
THE
FIRE
WAS
AN
FBI
ACCIDENT
AND
THAT
THE
FIRE
WAS
STARTED
BY
THE
BD
I
FIND
THE
LATTER
MORE
LIKELY
BASED
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
IVE
SEEN
SO
FAR
NO
I
THINK
THAT
D
IS
ALSO
QUITE
REASONABLE
I
PERSONALLY
CANT
REALLY
ASSES
ANY
RELATIVE
PROBABLITIES
TO
EITHER
OF
THESE
PROBABILITIES
ALTHOUGH
IF
FORCED
TO
BET
ON
THE
ISSUE
I
WOULD
PROBABLY
TAKE
AN
ACCIDENT
EITHER
FBI
OR
BD
OVER
INTENTIAL
SETTING
OF
THE
FIRE
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
ADD
A
COMMENT
RELATED
TO
THE
REPORTS
THAT
BODIES
RECOVERED
HAD
GUNSHOT
WOUNDS
THE
CORONER
WAS
ON
THE
TODAY
SHOW
THIS
MORNING
AND
CATEGORICALLY
DENIED
THAT
THEYVE
REACH
ANY
SUCH
CONCLUSIONS
HE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
UNDER
INTENSE
HEAT
SUFFICIENT
PRESSURE
BUILDS
UP
IN
THE
HEAD
THAT
CAN
CAUSE
IT
TO
EXPLODE
AND
THAT
THIS
CAN
LOOK
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
A
MASSIVE
GUNSHOT
WOUND
TO
THE
HEAD
WHICH
IS
QUITE
CONSISTED
WITH
TE
REPORTS
IVE
READ
AND
HEARD
IN
SHORT
THERES
BEEN
ALMOST
NO
EVIDENCE
CORROBORATING
ANY
OF
THE
MANY
SCENARIOS
AS
TO
WHAT
HAPPENED
ON
MONDAY
WE
SHOULD
REMAIN
SKEPTICAL
UNTIL
MORE
INFORMATION
IS
AVAILABLE
