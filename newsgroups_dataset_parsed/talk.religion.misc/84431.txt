RE
AFTER
YEARS
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY
IS
IN
MY
MIND
TO
SAY
THAT
SCIENCE
HAS
ITS
BASIS
IN
VALUES
IS
A
BIT
OF
A
REACH
SCIENCE
HAS
ITS
BASIS
IN
OBSERVABLE
FACT
ID
SAY
THAT
WHAT
ONE
CHOOSES
TO
OBSERVE
AND
HOW
THE
OBSERVATION
IS
INTERPRETED
AND
WHAT
SIGNIFICANCE
ITS
GIVEN
DEPENDS
A
GREAT
DEAL
ON
THE
VALUES
OF
THE
OBSERVER
SCIENCE
IS
A
HUMAN
ACTIVITY
AND
AS
SUCH
IS
SUBJECT
TO
THE
SAME
POTENTIAL
FOR
DISTORTION
AS
ANY
OTHER
HUMAN
ACTIVITY
THE
MYTH
THAT
SCIENTISTS
ARE
ABOVE
MORAL
INFLUENCE
OR
ETHICAL
CONCERN
THAT
THEIR
KNOWLEDGE
CAN
BE
ABSTACTED
WHOLE
AND
PURE
FROM
NATURE
UNTAINTED
BY
THE
BIASES
OF
THE
SCIENTIST
IS
NONSENSE
BILL
IF
ONE
IS
TO
ARGUE
FOR
OBJECTIVE
VALUES
IN
A
MORAL
SENSE
THEN
ONE
MUST
FIRST
START
BY
DEMONSTRATING
THAT
MORALITY
ITSELF
IS
OBJECTIVE
CONSIDERING
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORD
OBJECTIVE
I
DOUBT
THAT
THIS
WILL
EVER
HAPPEN
SO
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
AND
OBJECTIVE
MORALITY
IS
THIS
MAY
BE
AN
UNFORTUNATE
CHOICE
OF
WORDS
ALMOST
SELFCONTRADICTORY
OBJECTIVE
IN
THE
SENSE
USED
HERE
MEANS
SOMETHING
IMMUTABLE
AND
ABSOLUTE
WHILE
MORALITY
DESCRIBES
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
SOME
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
THE
FIRST
TERM
IS
ALL
INCLUSIVE
THE
SECOND
IS
SPECIFIC
THE
CONCEPT
SUPPOSEDLY
DESCRIBED
MAY
HAVE
MEANING
HOWEVER
IF
THERE
IS
A
GOD
AS
DESCRIBED
BY
THE
CHRISTIANS
FOR
INSTANCE
THEN
HE
HAS
EXISTENCE
APART
FROM
AND
INDEPENDENT
OF
HUMANKIND
HIS
EXISTENCE
IS
OUTSIDE
OF
OUR
FRAME
OF
REFERENCE
REALITY
IF
THIS
BEING
DECLARES
A
THING
TO
BE
SO
IT
IS
NECESSARILY
SO
SINCE
HE
HAS
DEFINED
HIMSELF
AS
OMNIPOTENT
AND
IF
HIS
CLAIMS
ARE
TO
BE
BELIEVED
HE
IS
AT
LEAST
OMNIPOTENT
RELATIVE
TO
US
GOD
IS
INTRINSICALLY
SELFDEFINED
AND
ALL
REALITY
IS
WHATEVER
HE
SAYS
IT
IS
IN
AN
OBJECTIVE
SENSE
IF
GOD
DETERMINES
A
STANDARD
OF
CONDUCT
THAT
STANDARD
IS
OBJECTIVE
IF
HUMAN
BEINGS
ARE
HELD
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
THEIR
CONFORMANCE
TO
THAT
STANDARD
WHILE
PERMITTED
TO
IGNORE
IT
THEY
SUBSTITUTE
A
RELATIVE
MORALITY
OR
MODE
OF
CONDUCT
GIVING
THE
TERM
MORALITY
A
NEBULOUS
MEANINGLESS
SENSE
THAT
CAN
BE
ARGUED
ABOUT
BY
THOSE
PRETENDING
TO
MISUNDERSTAND
THE
STANDARD
IS
OBJECTIVE
AND
THE
CONDUCT
REQUIRED
TO
MEET
THAT
STANDARD
IS
THEREFORE
OBJECTIVELY
DETERMINED
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
IS
CONVENIENT
TO
PRETEND
THAT
THE
TERM
MORALITY
IS
INFINITELY
MALLEABLE
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
THE
OBJECTIVE
STANDARD
ITSELF
DOESNT
EXIST
MORALITY
HAS
COME
TO
MEAN
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
A
CULTURAL
NORM
OR
THE
PREFERRED
CONDUCT
OF
DECENT
PEOPLE
MAKING
IT
SEEM
SUBJECTIVE
BUT
IT
IS
DERIVED
FROM
AN
ABSOLUTE
OBJECTIVE
STANDARD
IRONICALLY
THIS
OBJECTIVE
STANDARD
IS
IN
PERFECT
ACCORD
WITH
OUR
TRUE
NATURE
ACCORDING
TO
CHRISTIANITY
AT
LEAST
YET
IS
CONDEMNED
AS
BEING
CONTRARY
TO
HUMAN
NRE
OPPRESSIVE
AND
SEVERE
THIS
MAY
BE
DUE
AS
BILL
MUCH
TO
OUR
AMORAL
INCLINATIONS
AS
TO
THE
STANDARD
ITSELF
BUT
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
ITS
THEREX
