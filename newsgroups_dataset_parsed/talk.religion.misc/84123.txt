and
loving

i
will
clarify
my
earlier
quote
gods
laws
were
originally
written
for
the
israelites
jesus
changed
that
fact
by
now
making
the
law
applicable
to
all
people
not
just
the
jews
gentiles
could
be
part
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
through
the
saving
grace
of
god
i
never
said
that
the
law
was
made
obsolete
by
jesus
just
for
reference
heres
the
earlier
quote
malcolm
lee
mleepostroyalroadsca
wrote
in
reference
to
leviticus
and
deuteronomy
these
laws
written
for
the
israelites
gods
chosen
people
whom
god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
these
are
two
conflicting
statements
to
say
one
is
a
clarification
of
the
other
is
a
breach
of
logic
i
dont
mind
people
shifting
their
position
on
an
issue
it
irritates
me
when
it
is
said
under
the
premise
that
no
change
was
made
what
about
deuteronomy
is
it
wrong
now
did
jesus
change
that
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
sure
he
does
this
however
he
doesnt
address
the
notion
of
stoning
nonvirgin
brides
because
this
needs
no
clarification
are
you
going
to
deny
that
deuteronomy
is
not
patently
clear
in
its
intent
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
ill
agree
that
there
is
a
lot
of
modern
day
pharisees
that
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
and
dont
believe
in
it
depending
on
how
they
use
this
knowledge
they
can
be
scary
they
can
argue
any
position
they
desire
and
back
it
up
with
selected
parts
of
the
bible
such
pharisees
include
david
koresh
and
adolph
hitler
i
will
qualify
this
by
saying
i
dont
know
if
they
actually
believed
what
they
were
preaching
but
the
ends
certainly
made
the
means
look
frightening
however
just
as
scary
are
those
that
dont
know
much
of
the
bible
but
believe
every
word
in
fact
this
is
probably
scarier
since
there
are
far
more
of
these
people
from
what
ive
seen
in
addition
they
are
very
easy
to
manipulate
by
the
aforementioned
pharisees
since
they
dont
know
enough
to
debate
with
these
people
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
no
it
demands
obedience
to
a
book
if
god
came
down
and
personally
told
me
how
i
should
behave
then
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
doing
gods
will
by
doing
it
however
if
preachers
pastors
and
evangelists
tell
me
to
obey
the
will
of
a
book
written
by
people
who
have
been
dead
for
close
to
two
millenia
even
longer
for
the
ot
even
if
i
follow
everything
in
it
with
my
heart
i
could
scarcely
be
honest
with
myself
by
saying
im
doing
the
will
of
god
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it
because
god
respects
it
too
well
if
god
respects
it
so
much
how
come
there
is
talk
in
the
bible
about
eternal
damnation
for
nonbelievers
i
see
little
respect
eminating
from
the
god
of
the
bible
i
see
a
selfish
and
spiteful
god
god
be
with
you
not
yours
thanks
malcolm
lee
rob
lanphier
and
for
the
curious
here
is
my
earlier
post
hmm
for
a
book
that
only
applied
to
the
israelites
deuteronomy
jesus
sure
quoted
it
a
lot
mt
in
addition
he
alludes
to
it
in
several
other
places
mt
mk
jn
and
just
in
case
it
isnt
clear
jesus
thought
the
old
testament
isnt
obsolete
ill
repeat
the
verse
in
matthew
which
gets
quoted
on
this
group
a
lot
do
not
think
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
have
not
come
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfill
them
i
tell
you
the
truth
until
heaven
and
earth
disappear
not
the
smallest
letter
not
the
least
stroke
of
a
pen
will
by
any
means
disappear
from
the
law
until
everything
is
accomplished
anyone
who
breaks
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
teaches
others
to
do
the
same
will
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
practices
and
teaches
these
commands
will
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
i
tell
you
that
unless
your
righteousness
surpasses
that
of
the
pharisees
and
the
teachers
of
the
law
you
will
certainly
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
mt
niv
in
pretty
red
letters
so
that
you
know
its
jesus
talking
this
causes
a
serious
dilemma
for
christians
who
think
the
old
testament
doesnt
apply
to
them
i
think
thats
why
paul
harvey
likes
quoting
it
so
much
