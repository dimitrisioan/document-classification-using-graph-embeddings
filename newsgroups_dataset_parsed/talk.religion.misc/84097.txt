i
told
some
friends
of
mine
two
weeks
ago
that
koresh
was
dead
the
fbi
and
the
batf
could
not
let
a
man
like
that
live
he
was
a
testimonial
to
their
stupidity
and
lies
deleted
unfortunately
i
think
youve
got
it
figured
pretty
well
i
also
ask
myself
the
question
why
did
they
plan
for
so
many
months
why
was
this
so
important
to
them
what
was
the
government
really
up
to
why
did
they
seal
the
warrant
were
they
after
koresh
or
were
they
after
the
first
and
second
amendments
among
others
allow
me
to
play
devils
advocate
a
moment
jg
o
what
was
called
many
months
of
planning
was
probably
the
intelligence
collecting
paperwork
and
interviews
o
its
important
to
them
because
it
justifies
budgets
o
the
warrant
was
sealed
to
keep
from
jeopardizing
the
the
governments
case
o
there
was
probably
no
one
actually
exercising
oversite
instead
a
system
of
bureaucratic
rules
has
been
set
up
for
such
incidents
like
computer
programs
these
have
to
be
debugged
periodically
especially
when
used
in
fringe
areas
cf
the
hostage
rescue
program
therefore
no
one
was
in
charge
and
no
one
can
reasonably
be
held
responsible
baloney
either
the
programmer
or
the
people
who
decided
to
let
their
actions
be
governed
by
the
program
are
clearly
at
fault
if
you
neglect
to
do
maintenance
on
your
car
and
the
steering
goes
out
you
are
responsible
for
the
death
of
all
those
kids
on
the
sidewalk
your
car
subsequently
drives
over
on
its
own
gene
