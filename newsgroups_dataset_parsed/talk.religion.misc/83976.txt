jesus
is
accusing
you
and
it
is
not
only
you
that
he
is
accusing
he
is
accusing
everyone
me
you
and
everyone
in
the
world
is
guilty
whether
one
sees
the
light
or
does
not
seen
the
light
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
we
do
evil
things
we
do
them
regardless
have
you
ever
made
a
mistake
have
you
ever
lied
to
someone
even
a
little
white
lie
have
you
ever
claimed
to
know
something
that
you
really
didnt
know
have
you
ever
hated
someone
have
you
ever
been
selfish
are
you
guilty
of
any
one
of
these
the
answer
is
of
course
yes
you
are
guilty
period
that
is
it
what
jesus
is
getting
at
no
big
surprise
feelings
do
not
even
enter
the
picture
consider
jesuss
use
of
the
word
guilt
as
how
a
court
uses
it
you
said
everyone
in
the
world
that
means
everyone
in
the
world
including
children
that
are
not
old
enough
to
speak
let
alone
tell
lies
if
jesus
says
everyone
you
cannot
support
that
by
referring
to
a
group
of
people
somewhat
smaller
than
everyone
