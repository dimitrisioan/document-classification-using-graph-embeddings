IS
A
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLE
OF
EXACTLY
WHAT
SEPARATES
REASON
AND
SCIENCE
FROM
NONSENSE
ALTHOUGH
I
AGREE
THAT
CREATION
IS
NONSENSE
I
SUBMIT
THAT
YOU
ARE
MAKING
THE
SAME
MISTAKE
THAT
CREATIONISTS
COMMONLY
DO
IN
THIS
AND
PREVIOUS
POSTS
I
THINK
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
ENGAGING
IN
THE
FALLACY
OF
FALSE
DICHOTOMY
YOU
HAVE
CONSISTENTLY
CHARACTERIZED
SCIENCERELIGION
AS
RATIONALISMNONSENSE
WHEN
IN
FACT
THE
LATTER
DO
NOT
FORM
A
COMPLETE
SET
OF

NEITHER
DO
THE
FORMER
FOR
THAT
MATTER
I
WISH
THAT
THE
SEMIEXPLICIT
LINKING
OF
EVOLUTION
TO
SOCALLED
RATIONAL
ATHEISM
COULD
BE
AVOIDED
IT
JUST
GIVES
THE
CREATIONISTS
FUEL
FOR
THEIR
OFTENREPEATED
INCANTATION
THAT
EVOLUTION
LEADS
TO

DAVE
NO
DAVE
AND
AS
AN
ANTHROPOLOGIST
I
TAKE
GREAT
UMBRAGE
WITH
THIS
MISREPRESENTATION
I
SENSE
THAT
IT
IS
YOU
THAT
HAS
MADE
THE
JUMP
FROM
CREATION
SCIENCE
TO
RELIGION
SEE
ABOVE
I
HAVE
CHARACTERIZED
SCIENCECREATION

AS
RATIONALISMNONSENSE
AND
THAT
IT
IS
WHEN
PEOPLE
PROMOTE
THEIR
RELIGIOUS

AS

THEY
BECOME
NONSENSE
KEPT
WHERE
THEY
BELONG
THEY
ARE
MEANINGFUL

WILL
TELL

HAVE

SEVERAL

IN

AND
IT
WORKS
THE

WAY
TOO
AND
I
HAVE
REPEATEDLY
SAID
SO
NEVER
HAVE
I
SAID
