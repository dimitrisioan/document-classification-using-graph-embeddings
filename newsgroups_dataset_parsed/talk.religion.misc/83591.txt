so
the
fact
that
stephen
did
not
reply
to
a
does
not
justify
the
conclusion
that
stephen
condoned
taking
quotes
out
of
context
in
a
excellent
now
under
what
conditions
could
such
a
conclusion
be
made
other
than
a
direct
assertion
by
his
part
replace
stephen
with
david
joslin
since
you
directed
the
same
accusation
of
hypocrisy
at
me
in
email
to
me
you
wrote
in
trm
robert
weiss
writes
a
promise
from
psalm
gee
since
you
wouldnt
be
at
all
hypocritical
you
must
be
really
busy
arguing
against
these
outofcontext
extracted
translations
as
you
may
recall
you
mailed
me
six
mail
messages
quoting
articles
by
robert
weiss
all
sent
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
you
added
naturally
i
await
your
arguments
against
this
outofcontext
translation
but
i
shall
not
await
holding
my
breath
and
wonder
when
you
get
to
sleep
disputing
all
these
outofcontext
extracted
translations
and
other
similar
comments
perhaps
you
could
explain
why
you
ever
thought
that
i
might
have
a
reason
to
read
all
of
these
articles
you
pulled
off
of
trm
much
less
write
responses
to
them
have
you
by
chance
ever
even
heard
of
inductive
logic
you
are
not
demonstrating
any
familiarly
with
it
ie
you
are
being
insufficiently
logical
i
am
familiar
with
inductive
logic
go
ahead
and
give
me
the
details
of
the
logic
that
led
you
to
conclude
incorrectly
that
i
would
condone
robert
weiss
taking
verses
out
of
context
your
conclusion
was
wrong
of
course
since
i
agree
that
both
you
and
robert
weiss
were
guity
of
taking
verses
out
of
context
nothing
hypocritical
about
that
is
there
since
you
reached
a
false
conclusion
you
made
some
mistake
in
your
logic
the
only
question
is
where
did
you
think
that
it
would
be
hypocritical
for
me
not
to
post
a
reply
to
robert
weiss
articles
did
you
make
the
common
creationist
error
of
confusing
a
lack
of
evidence
for
x
with
evidence
for
the
lack
of
x
is
your
grasp
of
inductive
logic
not
quite
as
firm
as
you
think
see
if
you
can
figure
out
what
your
mistake
was
and
learn
from
it
