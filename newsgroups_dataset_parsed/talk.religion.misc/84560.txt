HELL
IN
THE
KING
JAMES
VERSION
OF
THE
BIBLE
THERE
ARE
THREE
DIFFERENTS
WORDS
TRANSLATED
INTO
THE
WORD
HELL
THESE
GREEK
WORDS
HAVE
TOTALLY
DIFFERENT
MEANINGS
THE
WORDS
ARE
HADES
TARTAROS
AND
GEHENNA
IN
BIBICAL
USAGE
THE
GREEK
WORD
HADES
IS
USED
ONLY
TIMES
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
AND
IS
ROUGHLY
THE
EQUIVALENT
TO
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
WORD
SHEOL
MEANING
THE
GRAVE
OR
PIT
COMPARE
ACTS
WITH
PSALMS
HADES
MAY
BE
LIKENED
TO
A
HOLE
IN
THE
GROUND
IN
THE
BIBLE
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
FIRE
MOST
MODERN
BIBICAL
TRANSLATORS
ADMIT
THAT
THE
USE
IN
THE
ENGLISH
WORD
HELL
TO
TRANSLATE
HADES
AND
SHEOL
ARE
AN
UNFORTUNATE
AND
MISLEADING
PRACTICE
WHY
BECAUSE
WHEN
SEEING
THE
WORD
HELL
MANY
READERS
IMPUTE
TO
IT
THE
TRADITIONAL
CONNOTATION
OF
AN
EVERBURNING
INFERNO
WHEN
THIS
WAS
NEVER
REMOTELY
INTENDED
IN
THE
GREEK
LANGUAGE
OR
IN
OLD
ENGLISH
IN
ITS
TRUE
BIBICAL
USAGE
HADES
DOES
INDEED
REFER
TO
THE
STATE
OR
ABODE
OF
THE
DEAD
BUT
NOT
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
SPIRITS
WALKING
AROUND
IN
SOME
SORT
OF
SHADOWY
REALM
HADES
IS
SIMPLY
THE
ABODE
WE
CALL
THE
GRAVE
ALL
DEAD
GO
TO
THIS
HELL
THE
SECOND
HELL
OF
THE
BIBLE
TARTAROS
IS
MENTIONED
ONLY
ONCE
IN
SCRIPTURE
FOR
IF
GOD
SPARED
NOT
THE
ANGELS
THAT
SINNED
BUT
CAST
THEM
DOWN
TO
HELL
TARTAROS
AND
DELIVERED
THEM
INTO
CHAINS
OF
DARKNESS
TO
BE
RESERVED
UNTO
JUDGMENT
FOLLOWING
THEIR
REBELLION
TO
UNSEAT
GOD
FROM
HIS
THRONE
THE
ARCHANGEL
LUCIFER
NOW
SATAN
AND
A
THIRD
OF
THE
CREATED
ANGELS
NOW
DEMONS
WERE
EJECTED
FROM
HEAVEN
LUKE
THEY
WERE
CAST
DOWN
TO
TARTAROS
A
PLACE
OR
CONDITION
OF
RESTRAINT
THAT
GOD
HAS
IMPOSED
ON
THE
MUTINOUS
ANGELS
AS
THEY
AWAIT
ULTIMATE
JUDGMENT
JUDE
TARTAROS
THEN
IS
A
HELL
THAT
APPLIES
ONLY
TO
EVIL
REBELLIOUS
ANGELS
OR
DEMONS
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THAT
THE
ANCIENT
GREEKS
USED
THIS
WORD
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
PLACE
IN
WHICH
ZEUS
CONFINED
THE
REBELLIOUS
TITANS
NOWHERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
THERE
ANY
MENTION
OF
MEN
BEING
PUT
INTO
THIS
PARTICULAR
HELL
THE
THE
THIRD
WORD
THAT
IS
TRANSLATED
AS
HELL
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
GEHENNA
IT
COMES
FROM
THE
HEBREW
GAI
HINNOM
MEANING
VALLEY
OF
HINNIOM
HINNOM
IS
A
DEEP
NARROW
RAVINE
LOCATED
TO
THE
SOUTH
AND
SOUTHWEST
OF
JERUSALEM
IN
OLD
TESTAMENT
TIMES
IT
WAS
A
PLACE
OF
ABOMINABLE
PAGAN
RITES
INCLUDING
INFANT
SACRIFICE
IT
WAS
THERE
THAT
THE
APOSTATE
KINGS
AHAZ
AND
MANASSEH
MADE
THEIR
CHILDREN
PASS
THROUGH
THE
FIRE
TO
THE
GOD
MOLECH
THE
RITES
WERE
SPECIFICALLY
CELEBRATED
IN
TOPHET
THE
PLACE
OF
ABHORRENCE
ONE
OF
THE
CHIEF
GROVES
IN
THE
VALLEY
KING
JOSIAH
OF
ANCIENT
JUDAH
FINALLY
PUT
AN
END
TO
THESE
ABOMINATIONS
HE
DEFILED
THE
VALLEY
RENDERING
IT
CEREMONIALLY
UNCLEAN
KINGS
LATER
THE
VALLEY
BECAME
THE
CESSPOOL
AND
CITY
DUMP
OF
JERUSALEM
A
REPOSITORY
FOR
SEWAGE
REFUSE
AND
ANIMAL
CARCASSES
THE
BODIES
OF
DISPISED
CRIMINALS
WERE
ALSO
BURNED
THERE
ALONG
WITH
THE
RUBBISH
FIRES
BURNED
CONTINUOUSLY
FEEDING
BY
A
CONSTANT
SUPPLY
OF
GARBAGE
AND
REFUSE
ACELDAMA
THE
FIELD
OF
BLOOD
PURCHASED
WITH
THE
MONEY
JUDAS
RECEIVED
FOR
THE
BETRAYAL
OF
CHRIST
WAS
ALSO
IN
PART
OF
THE
VALLEY
OF
HINNOM
SO
WHAT
DOES
THIS
VALLEY
CALLED
GEHENNA
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
HELL
IN
THE
SATAN
INSPIRED
POLITICAL
DICTATOR
AND
A
MIRACLEWORKING
RELIGIOUS
FIGURE
THE
FALSE
PROPHET
WORKING
WITH
HIM
WILL
RESIST
THE
REESTABLISHMENT
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
GOD
BY
JESUS
CHRIST
AT
HIS
SECOND
COMING
THEIR
FATE
IS
REVEALED
BY
THE
APOSTLE
JOHN
AND
THE
BEAST
WAS
TAKEN
AND
WITH
HIM
THE
FALSE
PROPHET
THESE
BOTH
WERE
CAST
ALIVE
INTO
A
LAKE
OF
FIRE
BURNING
WITH
BRIMSTONE
WHERE
WILL
THIS
TEMPORARY
LAKE
OF
FIRE
THIS
HELL
BE
THE
PROPHET
ISAIAH
WROTE
OF
THIS
LAKE
OF
FIRE
PREPARED
FOR
THE
BEAST
FOR
TOPHET
IN
THE
VALLEY
OF
HINNOM
IS
ORDAINED
OF
OLD
YEA
FOR
THE
KING
IT
IS
PREPARED
HE
HATH
MADE
IT
DEEP
AND
LARGE
THE
PILE
THEREOF
IS
FIRE
AND
WOOD
THE
BREATH
OF
THE
LORD
LIKE
A
STREAM
OF
BRIMSTONE
DOTH
KINDLE
IT
ONE
THOUSAND
YEARS
LATER
SATAN
HIMSELF
WILL
BE
CAST
INTO
THIS
REKINDLED
FIERY
LAKE
WHERE
THE
BEAST
AND
FALSE
PROPHET
WERE
CAST
BUT
WHAT
OF
THE
WICKED
WHO
HAVE
DIED
OVER
THE
MILLENNIA
DOES
THE
BIBLE
SAY
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOW
SUFFERING
FIERY
PUNISHMENT
FOR
THEIR
SINS
IN
A
LAKE
OF
FIRE
IN
THE
SEQUENCE
OF
THE
INCORRIGIBLY
WICKED
ARE
RESURRECTED
TO
BE
THROWN
INTO
THE
LAKE
OF
FIRE
AFTER
SATAN
IS
CAST
THERE
WHAT
WILL
BECOME
OF
THESE
WICKED
WILL
THEY
WRITHE
IN
FLAMES
FOR
ETERNITY
THE
WICKED
WILL
BE
BURNED
UP
FROM
THE
INTENSE
HEAT
OF
THE
COMING
GEHENNA
FIRE
ON
THE
EARTH
THEY
WIL
BE
CONSUMED
ANNIHILATED
DESTROYED
THIS
PUNISHMENT
WILL
BE
EVERLASTING
PERMANENT
AND
FINAL
THE
BIBLE
CALLS
IT
THE
SECOND
DEATH
FROM
WHICH
THERE
IS
NO
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
FURTHER
RESURRECTION
THE
BIBLE
DOES
TEACH
ETERNAL
PUNISHMENT
BUT
NOT
ETERNAL
PUNISHING
THE
PROPHET
MALACHI
PROVIDES
A
GRAPHIC
DESCRIPTION
FOR
BEHOLD
THE
DAY
COMETH
THAT
SHALL
BURN
AS
AN
OVEN
AND
ALL
THE
PROUD
YEA
AND
ALL
THAT
DO
WICKEDLY
SHALL
BE
STUBBLE
AND
THE
DAY
THAT
COMETH
SHALL
BURN
THEM
UP
TO
THE
RIGHTEOUS
GOD
SAYS
THAT
THE
WICKED
SHALL
BE
ASHES
UNDER
THE
SOLES
OF
YOUR
GEHENNA
WAS
A
PLACE
OF
DESTRUCTION
AND
DEATH
NOT
A
PLACE
OF
LIVING
TORTURE
JESUS
WAS
TALKING
TO
JEWS
WHO
UNDERSTOOD
ALL
ABOUT
THIS
GEHENNA
OR
VALLEY
OF
HINNOM
UTTER
DESTRUCTION
BY
FIRE
WAS
COMPLETE
NOTHING
WAS
LEFT
BUT
ASHES
EVERY
TEXT
IN
THE
BIBLE
TRANSLATED
FROM
THIS
GREEK
WORD
GEHENNA
MEANS
COMPLETE
DESTRUCTION
NOT
LIVING
TORTURE
NOT
ETERNAL
LIFE
IN
TORMENT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
IN
ROMANS
THE
WAGES
OF
SIN
IS
DEATH
NOT
ETERNAL
LIFE
IN
TORTURE
THE
PUNISHMENT
REVEALED
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
DEATH
THE
CESSATION
OF
LIFE
ETERNAL
LIFE
IS
THE
GIFT
OF
GOD
