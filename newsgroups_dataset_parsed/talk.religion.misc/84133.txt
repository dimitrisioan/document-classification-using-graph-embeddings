WRITES
ROBERT
YOU
KEEP
MAKING
REFERENCES
TO
ORTHODOX
BELIEF
AND
SAYING
THINGS
LIKE
IT
IS
HELD
THAT
CF
KERMIT
THREAD
ON
WHAT
EXACT
BODY
OF
THEOLOGY
ARE
YOU
DRAWING
FOR
WHAT
YOU
CALL
ORTHODOX
WHO
IS
THAT
HOLDS
THAT
LUKE
MEANT
WHAT
YOU
SAID
HE
MEANT
WHENEVER
YOUR
PERSONAL
INTERPRETATION
OF
BIBLICAL
PASSAGES
IS
CHALLENGED
YOUR
ONLY
RESPONSE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
ONE
NEEDS
MERELY
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
BIBLE
IN
ORDER
TO
SEE
THE
TRUTH
BUT
WHAT
OF
THOSE
WHO
SEE
BIBLICAL
THINGS
DIFFERENTLY
FROM
YOU
ARE
WE
TO
SIMPLY
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
REALLY
UNDERSTANDS
IT
JUST
CURIOUS

WHEN
ROBERT
REFERS
TO
THE
ORTHODOX
HE
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
HISTORICAL
POSITION
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
DERIVED
FROM
BIBLCAL
TEXTS
THROUGH
THE
CENTURIES
BY
THE
APOCOLIC
FATHERS
OF
THE
FAITH
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
THAT
PEOPLE
READ
THINGS
DIFFERENTLY
IN
THE
BIBLE
AND
THIS
IS
ALRIGHT
IN
PARTS
LIKE
PARABLES
AND
SUCH
FORTH
HOWEVER
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THE
ESSENTIAL
DOCTRINES
OF
THE
HISTORICAL
ORTHODOX
CHRISTAN
BELIEFS
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
CORRECT
WAY
TO
READ
IT
FOR
EXAMPLE
EITHER
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
TRINITY
IS
TRUE
OR
IT
IS
FALSE
YES
PEOPLE
READ
THE
TEXTS
DIFFERENTLY
BUT
ONLY
ONE
POSITION
IS
TRUE
THEY
BOTH
CANNOT
BE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
TEXT
THE
DOCTRINE
IS
TRUE
AND
HAS
ALWAYS
EXISTED
THEREFORE
WHEN
PEOPLE
LIKE
JOSEPH
SMITH
COME
ALONG
WITH
A
VISION
AND
THINKS
HE
CAN
UNDO
CENTURIES
OF
A
DOCTRINE
THAT
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
BIBLE
PEOPLE
CONSIDER
HIM
A
CULT
