RE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IN
ARTICLE
JBROWNBATMANBMDTRWCOM
WRITES
ACTUALLY
BOTH
ARE
POSITIVE
ARGUMENTS
POSITIVE
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
BEST
DESCRIPTION
HERE
DUE
TO
POSSIBLE
MISUNDERSTANDING
BUT
ITS
THE
TERM
YOU
USED
POSITIVE
ARGUMENTSASSERTIONS
CAN
BE
BOTH
AFFIRMATIVE
IE
GOD
EXISTS
AND
NEGATIVE
IE
GOD
DOES
NOT
EXIST
BOTH
CARRY
AN
EQUAL
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
BOTH
ASSERTING
THAT
A
CERTAIN
IDEA
IS
TRUE
THE
DEFAULT
CONDITION
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
A
PREPONDERANCE
OF
EVIDENCE
EITHER
WAY
IS
THAT
THE
PROPOSITION
OR
ASSERTION
IS
UNDECIDABLE
AND
THE
PERSON
WHO
TAKES
THE
UNDECIDABLE
POSITION
AND
SAYS
THAT
HESHE
SIMPLY
DISBELIEVES
THAT
THE
PROPOSITION
IS
TRUE
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
HOLDS
NO
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
SOCALLED
WEAK
ATHEIST
POSITION
IS
VIRTUALLY
UNASSAILABLE
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
STANDS
ON
A
FIRM
FOUNDATION
OF
LOGICAL
ARGUMENT
BUT
BECAUSE
ITS
PROPONENTS
SIMPLY
DISBELIEVE
IN
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GODS
AND
THEREFORE
THEY
HOLD
NO
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
WHEN
YOU
DONT
ASSERT
ANYTHING
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
PROVE
ANYTHING
THATS
WHERE
WEAK
ATHEISM
DRAWS
ITS
STRENGTH
BUT
ITS
STRENGTH
IS
ALSO
ITS
ACHILLES
HEEL
WITHOUT
ASSERTIONSAXIOMS
ONE
HAS
NO
FOUNDATION
UPON
WHICH
TO
BUILD
AS
A
PHILOSOPHY
ITS
VIRTUALLY
WORTHLESS
IMO
OF
COURSE
SO
IF
I
WERE
TO
ASSERT
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
THOUSAND
YEAR
OLD
INVISIBLE
PINK
UNICORNS
RESIDING
IN
MY
WALLS
I
NEED
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
WITH
EVIDENCE
I
THINK
THE
LACK
OF
EVIDENCE
SHALL
SUFFICE
WHO
HAPPEN
TO
LIKE
LISTENING
TO
SATANIC
MESSAGES
FOUND
IN
PLAYING
BEETHOVENS
SYMPHONY
BACKWARDS
FBI
OFFICIALS
SAID
CULT
LEADER
DAVID
KORESH
MAY
HAVE
FORCED
FOLLOWERS
TO
REMAIN
AS
FLAMES
CLOSED
IN
KORESHS
ARMED
GUARD
MAY
HAVE
INJECTED
AS
MANY
AS
CHILDREN
WITH
POISON
TO
QUIET
THEM
AND
GOD
SAW
EVERYTHING
HE
HAD
MADE
AND
BEHOLD
IN
WAS
VERY
GOOD
GENESIS
