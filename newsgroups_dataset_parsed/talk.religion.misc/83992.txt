RE
TO
ROB
LANPHIER
I
WROTE
MY
HOPE
IS
THAT
BRIAN
K
WILL
LOOK
AND
WILL
SEE
THE
RAMIFICATIONS
OF
THE
TRUCK
COMING
TOWARDS
HIM
MY
HOPE
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
WANT
TO
STEP
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
MY
FEAR
THOUGH
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
INSTEAD
CHOOSE
TO
GLUE
HIMSELF
TO
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
HIGHWAY
WHERE
HE
WILL
CERTAINLY
GET
RUN
OVER
BUT
IF
HE
SO
CHOOSES
HE
SO
CHOOSES
AND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
I
CAN
DO
BEYOND
THAT
TO
CHANGE
HIS
MIND
FOR
IT
IS
HIS
CHOICE
BUT
AT
THIS
VERY
MOMENT
BRIAN
HASNT
GOTTEN
EVEN
THAT
FAR
HE
IS
STILL
AT
THE
POINT
WHERE
HE
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
LOOK
SURE
HE
MOVES
HIS
EYEBALL
TO
APPEASE
ME
BUT
HIS
HEAD
WILL
NOT
TURN
AROUND
TO
SEE
THE
ENTIRE
PICTURE
SO
FAR
HE
IS
SATISFIED
WITH
HIS
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
MOUNTAINS
OFF
IN
THE
DISTANCE
KENT
SANDVIK
WRITES
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
YOU
IMAGINE
HIM
INSIDE
THIS
HUGE
WALL
UNABLE
TO
SEE
REALITY
WHILE
HE
IMAGINES
THE
SAME
ABOUT
YOU
CLEARLY
WE
HAVE
A
CASE
WHERE
RELATIVITY
PLAYS
A
BIG
ROLE
CONCERNING
LOOKING
AT
OPPOSITE
FRAMES
OF
REALITY
KENT
WITH
REGARDS
TO
THE
INFORMATION
CONTAINED
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
IS
THE
ORIGINAL
CONTEXT
OF
THIS
THREAD
BRIAN
KENDIG
IS
INSIDE
A
HUGE
WALL
BRIAN
IS
INSIDE
THE
BIBLE
AND
THE
INFORMATION
CONTAINED
THEREIN
ARE
OUTSIDE
THE
WALL
BRIAN
KENDIG
PROVES
THIS
VERY
SAD
FACT
BY
THE
ABSURD
THINGS
HE
SAYS
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
I
GET
THROUGH
INTO
THE
FIREY
PIT
I
WILL
CEASE
TO
EXIST
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
SAY
THAT
HE
HASNT
A
CLUE
EVEN
TO
WHAT
JESUS
SAID
ABOUT
HELL
THAT
IS
BUT
ONE
EXAMPLE
NOW
IN
YOUR
SENSE
KENT
OF
SENSING
REALITYTHAT
IS
A
DIFFERENT
MATTER
AND
TO
YOU
AND
TO
BRIAN
RELATIVITY
DOES
PLAY
A
BIG
ROLE
WHAT
WE
PERCEIVE
TO
BE
TRUE
DEPENDS
ON
OUR
VANTAGE
POINT
SINCE
I
HAVE
READ
THE
BIBLE
AND
BRIAN
KENDIG
SHOWS
THAT
HE
HASNT
HE
HAS
A
NARROWER
PERSPECTIVE
THAN
MINE
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
RESPECT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
BIBLE
I
AM
PROPOSING
TO
BRIAN
BRIAN
COME
UP
HERE
AND
TAKE
A
LOOK
FROM
THIS
VANTAGE
POINT
BUT
BRIAN
REPLIES
I
RATHER
NOT
THANK
YOU
I
AM
CONTENT
WHERE
I
AM
BESIDES
THE
VISTA
FROM
UP
THERE
STINKS
AND
IN
THE
MEANWHILE
BRIAN
IGNORES
THE
FACTS
THAT
HE
HAS
NEVER
UP
THERE
NOR
DOES
HE
REALIZE
I
HAD
SHARED
THE
SAME
PLATEAU
WHERE
BRIAN
NOW
STANDS
