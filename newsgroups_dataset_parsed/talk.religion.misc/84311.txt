ERIC

WRITES
BTW
THE
PARALLEL
UNIVERSE
APPROACH
IMPLYS
AN
ELEMENT
OF
MIND
IN
THE
VERY
PHYSICAL
REALITY
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
THIS
SOUNDS
INTERESTING
BUT
WHAT
EXACTLY
DO
YOU
MEAN
WELL
THE
BEST
THING
TO
DO
IS
TO
READ
THE
BOOK
PARALLEL
UNIVERSES
BY
DR
FRED
WOLF
IN
ESSENCE
DR
WOLF
SAYS
THAT
ONE
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
SUBATOMIC
PARTICLEWAVE
DUALITY
IS
THAT
WHAT
WE
PERCEIVE
AS
A
WAVE
IS
ACTUALLY
AN
INFINATE
NUMBER
OF
PARALLEL
UNIVERSES
OVERLAID
AND
IN
EACH
OF
THESE
UNIVERSES
THERE
IS
A
PARTICLE
IN
A
DIFFERENT
LOCATION
WHEN
WE
DO
SOMETHING
TO
MAKE
A
PARTICLE
APPEAR
WE
ARE
ACTUALLY
CAUSING
ALL
THE
PARALLEL
UNIVERSES
TO
COLLAPSE
INTO
ONE
APPARENTLY
THIS
IS
ONE
LINE
OF
THOUGHT
ON
THE
NATURE
OF
QM
THAT
IS
GOING
THROUGH
SOME
OF
THE
SCIENTIFIC
COMMUNITY
DR
WOLF
AND
MANY
OTHERS
CLAIM
THAT
SOMEHOW
THE
COLLAPSE
IS
CAUSED
BY
THE
MENTAL
EFFORT
OF
OBSERVING
THE
PARTICLE
THIS
IMPLYS
THAT
MIND
IS
MORE
THAN
MERELY
A
BIOLOGICAL
PHENOMENON
HE
THEN
EXTRAPOLATES
THAT
IF
MIND
IS
AN
INTEGRAL
PART
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
THEN
PERHAPS
CONSCIOUSNESS
IS
THE
ELEMENT
THAT
GIVES
ORDER
AND
FORM
TO
THE
UNIVERSES
ITTHEMSELFS
IT
ALL
GETS
RATHER
INTERESTING
BUT
WHAT
I
FIND
FACINATING
IS
THAT
THIS
WOULD
EXPLAIN
THE
PHENOMENON
OF
MAGICK
AS
PRACTICED
IN
MY
RELIGION
DR
WOLF
SPECULATES
THAT
THE
ORDERING
FUNCTIONALITY
OF
MIND
COULD
BE
CAUSED
BY
THE
SELECTION
OF
A
FUTURE
FROM
AN
INFINITE
NUMBER
OF
POSSIBLE
FUTURES
HE
SAYS
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
BE
DONE
BY
SOME
SORT
OF
COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN
ONES
CURRENT
AND
POSSIBLE
FUTURE
SELVES
I
HAVE
LONG
SPECULATED
THAT
IF
MAGICK
IS
NOT
MERELY
A
FORM
OF
SELF
DELUSION
THEN
PERHAPS
IT
COULD
BE
CAUSED
BY
SOME
SORT
OF
A
SELECTION
OF
ONE
OF
MANY
POSSIBLE
FUTURES
I
REALIZE
THAT
THIS
GETS
PRETTY
BIZARRE
BUT
IT
NEVER
HURTS
TO
KEEP
AN
OPEN
MIND
AND
AT
LEAST
FILE
IT
ALL
AWAY
AS
ANOTHER
POSSIBILE
EXPLAINATION
OF
THE
WORLD
IN
WHICH
WE
FIND
OURSELVES
AFTER
ALL
THE
MORE
WE
LEARN
ABOUT
THE
UNIVERSE
IN
WHICH
WE
LIVE
THE
MORE
WE
LEARN
THAT
IT
IS
TRULY
A
VERY
STRANGE
PLACE
