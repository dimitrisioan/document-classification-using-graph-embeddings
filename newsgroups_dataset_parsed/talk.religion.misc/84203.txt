RE
A
MESSAGE
FOR
YOU
MR
PRESIDENT
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
ARTICLE
TBRENTBANKECNPURDUEEDU
TIMOTHY
J
BRENT
WRITES
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
WHAT
FIREMAN
SHOULD
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
A
BLAZE
LIKE
THAT
AND
GET
SHOT
AT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
NEARLY
ALL
OF
THEM
WITNESS
LA
FIREMEN
ARE
AMONG
OUR
REAL
HEROES
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
I
WONDER
WHEN
THEY
WERE
ACTUALLY
AASKED
TO
COME
OR
IF
THEY
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
THE
FIRE
OVER
THE
TV
SHOT
AT
BY
WHOM
PROVE
IT
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
BREAKING
THE
LAW
I
AGREE
THESE
WERENT
THE
BEST
TACTICS
WHEN
LAW
REPLACES
JUSTICE
THE
SYSTEM
IS
DYING
OR
DEAD
NOTE
THAT
WE
HAD
A
SMALL
REVOLUTION
YEARS
AGO
ON
THIS
POINT
THEY
PROBABLY
SHOULD
HAVE
BACKED
OFF
PULLED
THE
PERIMETER
WAY
BACK
AND
LET
THEM
SIT
THERE
WITH
NO
MEDIA
ATTENTION
UNTIL
THEY
DECIDED
TO
COME
OUT
THE
ONLY
OTHER
ALTERNATIVE
I
SEE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TO
SEND
IN
A
COUPLE
OF
SPECIAL
FORCES
GUYS
TO
CAPTURE
OR
ASSASSINATE
KORESH
BUT
REMEMBER
THESE
FRUIT
OR
PERHAPS
JUST
WAIT
OR
MAYBEEVEN
SEND
IN
A
FEW
AGENTS
WHO
ARE
CHRISTIAN
TO
SIT
DOWN
AND
PRAY
OUTSIDE
THE
LINE
TRY
AFFINITY
RATHER
THAN
SUBVERSION
LOOPS
WERE
PUTTING
THEIR
LIVES
ON
THE
LINES
VOLUNTARILY
WHY
SHOULD
CHUCKLE
SO
WOULD
YOU
IF
SOMEONE
POINTS
A
GUN
AT
YOU
AT
THAT
POINT
YOU
CAN
DIE
OR
LIVE
AND
IF
LIVING
MEANS
STAYNG
IN
A
BUILDING
TO
KEEP
BADGE
CARRYING
NUTS
OFF
YOUR
KIDS
I
SUSPECT
YOU
MIGHT
AS
WELL
BOTH
SIDES
WERE
WRONG
LAWABIDING
CITIZENS
HAVE
TO
PUT
THEMSELVES
IN
ANY
MORE
DANGER
THAN
NECESSARY
WHEN
DEALING
WITH
A
NUT
LOOK
AT
THE
MAN
WHO
JUMPED
OUT
OF
HIS
BRADLEY
TO
GRAB
A
FLAMING
WOMEN
WHO
WAS
RUNNING
BACK
INTO
THE
BUILDING
YEAH
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
THEY
WERE
TRYING
TO
SAVE
THOSE
PEOPLE
I
DONT
THINK
I
WOULD
RISK
MY
LIFE
THAT
MUCH
TO
SAVE
SOMEONE
THAT
STUPID
THAT
OBVIOUSLY
DIDNT
EVEN
WANT
TO
BE
SAVED
TRY
AGAIN
