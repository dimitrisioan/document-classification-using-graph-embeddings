IM
NOT
SURE
THAT
YOU
CAN
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
MYTH
AND
LEGEND
SO
NEATLY
OR
AT
ALL
A
MYTH
IS
MORE
THAN
A
SINGLE
STORY

THOUGHT
STRUCTURE
AND
WORLDPARADIGM

WHICH
THAT
STORY
IS
INTERPRETED
IS
AS
IMPORTANT
A
PART
OF
THE
MYTH
AS
THE
STORY
ITSELF
THUS
I
CAN
THINK
OF
NO
STORY
WHICH
IS
MEANT
TO
BE
CONVEYED
UNDERSTANDABLY
FROM
ONE
PERSON
TO
ANOTHER
WITHIN
A
