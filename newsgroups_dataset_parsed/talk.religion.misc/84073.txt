IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED

BRIAN
KENDIG
WRITES
JOHN
MOST
ASSUREDLY
I
SAY
TO
YOU
UNLESS
A
GRAIN
OF
WHEAT
FALLS
ONTO
THE
GROUND
AND
DIES
IT
REMAINS
ALONE
BUT
IF
IT
DIES
IT
PRODUCES
MUCH
GRAIN
HE
WHO
LOVES
HIS
LIFE
WILL
LOSE
IT
AND
HE
WHO
HATES
HIS
LIFE
IN
THIS
WORLD
WILL
KEEP
IT
FOR
ETERNAL
LIFE
IF
ANYONE
SERVES
ME
LET
HIM
FOLLOW
ME
AND
WHERE
I
AM
THERE
MY
SERVANT
WILL
BE
ALSO
IF
ANYONE
SERVES
ME
HIM
MY
FATHER
WILL
HONOR
WHY
WOULD
I
WANT
AN
ETERNAL
LIFE
IF
I
HATE
THIS
ONE
AGAIN
YOU
MISSED
JESUSS
POINT
IF
YOU
READ
THE
SURROUNDING
PASSAGES
YOU
WOULD
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
JESUS
MEANS
BY
LIFE
IN
THE
WORLD
BUT
AS
IS
YOU
BUMBLED
AROUND
ASSERTED
YOUR
STANDARD
AXIOM
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
BUNK
AND
CAME
UP
WITH
THE
WRONG
IDEA
ALSO
YOU
DO
NOT
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
JESUS
MEANS
BY
ETERNAL
LIFE
BRIAN
K
DO
YOU
EXPECT
TO
JUMP
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
QUANTUM
MECHANICS
BOOK
AND
UNDERSTAND
HERMITE
POLYNOMIALS
HAVING
NOT
READ
THE
SURROUNDING
MATERIAL
WHY
DO
YOU
SUCH
WITH
THE
BIBLE
FOR
AN
IDEA
WHAT
JESUS
MEANS
BY
THE
WORLD
LOOK
UP
REFERENCES
TO
IT
IN
YOUR
CONCORDANCE
FOR
A
GOOD
DESCRIPTION
THE
WHOLE
BOOK
OF
ECCLESIASTES
IS
GAME
FOR
ETERNAL
LIFE
CHECK
OUT
JOHN
JOHN
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
ETERNAL
LIFE
IS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
THAN
WHAT
YOU
THINK
ETERNAL
LIFE
STARTS
NOWAN
INFINITELY
HIGH
QUALITY
OF
LIFE
LIVING
IN
FELLOWSHIP
WITH
GOD
IN
SHORT
EVEN
IF
YOUR
DEITY
DOES
EXIST
THAT
DOESNT
AUTOMATICALLY
MEAN
THAT
I
WOULD
WORSHIP
IT
I
AM
CONTENT
TO
LIVE
MY
OWN
LIFE
AND
FEND
FOR
MYSELF
SO
WHEN
I
DIE
I
CAN
BE
PROUD
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
NO
MATTER
WHERE
I
END
UP
IT
WILL
BE
BECAUSE
OF
MY
ACTIONS
AND
MY
CHOICES
IF
YOUR
GOD
DECIDES
TO
TOSS
ME
INTO
A
FLAMING
PIT
FOR
THIS
THEN
SO
BE
IT
I
WOULD
MUCH
RATHER
JUST
CEASE
TO
EXIST
BUT
IF
YOUR
GOD
WANTS
MY
RESPECT
AND
MY
OBEDIENCE
THEN
IT
HAD
BETTER
EARN
THESE
AND
IF
IT
DOES
THEN
THEY
WILL
BE
VERY
STRONG
AND
TRUE
IF
MY
DIETY
EXISTS
YOU
WOULD
NOT
JUST
CEASE
TO
EXIST
JESUS
TALKS
OF
HELL
IN
LUKE
YOUVE
GOT
TO
UNDERSTAND
MY
POINTOFVIEW
I
SEE
CHRISTIANS
SPOUTING
BIBLE
VERSE
ALL
THE
TIME
AS
IF
IT
WERE
SOME
SORT
OF
MAGIC
SPELL
THAT
WILL
LEVEL
ALL
OPPOSITION
TRUTH
IS
ITS
NOT
ROBERT
HAS
NEVER
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
HE
ACTUALLY
UNDERSTANDS
WHAT
THE
VERSES
IMPLY
HE
JUST
RATTLES
THEM
OFF
DAY
BY
DAY
SOME
BRAZENLY
FLY
IN
THE
FACE
OF
COMMON
SENSE
AND
REALITY
AND
I
POINT
THESE
OUT
WHERE
I
CAN
THE
TRUTH
IS
IS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
SOME
SORT
OF
MAGIC
SPELL
THE
TRUTH
IS
IS
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
IT
AND
ENJOY
NOT
UNDERSTANDING
IT
CHRISTANITY
IS
A
VERY
NICE
BELIEF
SET
AROUND
A
VERY
NICE
BOOK
WRONG
AGAIN
CHRISTIANITY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
RELATIONSHIP
YOU
DO
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
AND
YOU
ARE
ARGUING
AGAINST
IT
AND
IN
MY
OPINION
YOURE
BUMBLING
ABOUT
BLINDLY
MAKING
UP
ENTITIES
WHERE
THERE
ARENT
ANY
AND
DEPRIVING
YOURSELF
OF
A
TRUE
UNDERSTANDING
AND
ENJOYMENT
OF
YOUR
LIFE
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
KEEP
YOUR
BELIEFS
TO
YOURSELF
ILL
KEEP
MY
BELIEFS
TO
MYSELF
BUT
AS
SOON
AS
YOU
START
WAVING
THEM
AROUND
EXPECT
ME
TO
TOSS
IN
MY
OPINIONS
TOO
JUST
AS
I
MAKE
UP
SUCH
PLACES
AS
JERICHO
JERUSALEM
BABYLON
CORINTH
EPHESUS
SUSA
AND
SUCH
KINGS
AS
NEBUCHANEZZAR
DAVID
SOLOMON
SENNACHERIB
HEROD
PONTIUS
PILATE
BUT
I
GUESS
THEN
THAT
YOU
TREAT
ABRAHAM
LINCOLN
AS
A
MYTH
LIKE
YOU
DO
ODIN
AND
ZEUS
