WRITES
ANYWAY
IVE
OFTEN
WONDERED
WHAT

FOLLOWERS

AFTER

IMO
A
CHRISTIAN
HAS
NO
NEED
OF
WEAPONS
I
KNOW
IT
IS
VERY
CONTRARY
TO
THE
AMERICAN
NRA
ETHOS
OF
THE
RIGHT
TO
BEAR
ARMS
BUT
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
RELY
ON
THE
STRENGTH
OF
GOD
TO
PROTECT
THEM
NOTE
THAT
I
SAY
SHOULD
WE
ARE
INHERENTLY
INSECURE
BUT
I
FEEL
THAT
THAT
IS
NOT
PROPER
JUSTIFICATION
TO
BE
ARMED
TO
THE
TEETH
A
CHRISTIAN
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
RELY
ON
PHYSICAL
WEAPONS
TO
DEFEND
HIMSELF
A
CHRISTIAN
SHOULD
RELY
ON
HIS
FAITH
AND
INTELLIGENCE
FOR
INSTANCE
I
HAVE
THE
FAITH
THAT
GOD
WILL
PROTECT
ME
BUT
GOD
ALSO
GAVE
ME
THE
INTELLIGENCE
TO
KNOW
NOT
TO
GO
WALKING
DOWN
THAT
DARK
ALLEY
AT
NIGHT
TO
JUMP
OFF
A
CLIFF
AND
SAY
THAT
GOD
WILL
SAVE
ME
WOULD
BE
PUTTING
GOD
TO
THE
TEST
AND
WHO
ARE
WE
TO
TEST
GOD
GOD
BE
WITH
YOU
