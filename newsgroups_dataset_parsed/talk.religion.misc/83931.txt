RE
A
KIND
AND
LOVING
GOD
IN
ARTICLE
MLEEPOSTROYALROADSCA
MALCOLM
LEE
WRITES
THE
ONLY
POINT
IM
TRYING
TO
MAKE
IS
THAT
THOSE
WHO
CALL
THEMSELVES
CHRISTIAN
MAY
NOT
BE
CHRISTIAN
WOW
ARE
YOU
SERIOUS
SO
NOT
EVERYONE
WHO
CALLS
THEMSELF
A
CHRISTIAN
IS
A
CHRISTIAN
WOW
THAT
DOES
MAKE
THINGS
A
BIT
MORE
COMPLICATED
DOESNT
IT
I
ASK
THAT
YOU
DRAW
YOUR
OWN
CONCLUSIONS
BY
WHAT
THEY
DO
AND
WHAT
THEY
SAY
THAT
SEEMS
LIKE
VERY
GOOD
ADVICE
GIVEN
THE
ABOVE
REVELATION
IF
THEY
ARE
NOT
MODELLED
AFTER
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
THEN
THEY
ARE
NOT
CHRISTIAN
LIKE
FOR
EXAMPLE
MATTHEW
RIGHT
IF
THEY
HAVE
NOT
REPENTED
OF
THEIR
SINS
AND
ACCEPTED
JESUS
CHRIST
AS
THEIR
PERSONAL
LORD
AND
SAVIOUR
THEN
THEY
ARE
NOT
CHRISTIAN
UM
WHERE
DID
JESUS
SAY
THAT
HE
WANTED
PEOPLE
TO
WORSHIP
HIM
THESE
ARE
THE
ONLY
CRITERIA
TO
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
SO
DO
YOU
ADHERE
TO
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
