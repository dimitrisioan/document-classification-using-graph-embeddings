THE
MORMON
JESUS
IS
THE
SPIRIT
BROTHER
OF
LUCIFER
THAT
JESUS
IS
GOD
GB
THE
FATHERS
FIRST
BORN
SPIRIT
CHILD
THAT
JESUS
WAS
BEGOTTEN
ON
EARTH
GB
THROUGH
NATURAL
MEANS
NOT
BY
THE
HOLY
GHOST
THAT
HE
SWEAT
HIS
BLOOD
GB
FOR
OUR
SINS
IN
THE
GARDEN
OF
GETHSEMANE
THAT
HIS
BLOOD
CANNOT
GB
CLEANSE
FROM
ALL
SIN
THAT
HE
IS
NOW
AMONG
MANY
MILLIONS
OF
OTHER
GB
GODS
THAT
JESUS
IS
JEHOVAH
AND
THE
FATHER
IS
ELOHIM
IN
THE
OT
GB
JEHOVAH
AND
ELOHIM
ARE
THE
SAME
THAT
HE
NEEDED
TO
BE
SAVED
GB
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
MORMONS
BELIEVE
THAT
ALL
SPIRITS
INCLUDING
JESUS
LUCIFER
ROBERT
WEISS
ARE
IN
THE
SAME
FAMILY
IT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
JESUS
WAS
CREATED
BUT
RATHER
THAT
LUCIFER
AND
ROBERT
WEISS
WERE
NOT
I
AGREE
THAT
THIS
IS
A
HERESY
SO
WHAT
THE
SWEATING
OF
BLOOD
IN
GETHSEMENE
IS
NOT
A
BASIC
MORMON
DOCTRINE
JESUS
DID
NOT
PERFORM
THE
ATONEMENT
IN
GETHESEME
ALONE
AS
SOME
ANTIMORMONS
ARE
TRYING
TO
TEACH
AS
FAR
AS
THE
UNPARDONABLE
SIN
WHATEVER
THAT
IS
IT
IS
BIBLICAL
AND
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
MORMON
IT
IS
ALSO
CALLED
THE
SIN
AGAINST
THE
HOLY
GHOST
MOST
BIBLE
SCHOLARS
OTHER
THAN
CONSERVATIVE
ONES
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
JEHOVAH
AND
ELOHIM
WERE
ALWAYS
THE
SAME
IM
SURE
YOUVE
HEARD
OF
THE
J
AND
THE
E
TEXTS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
THAT
HE
NEEDED
TO
BE
SAVED
JESUS
JEHOVAH
ELOHIM
IN
MORMON
DOCTRINE
JESUS
WAS
SINLESS
AND
THUS
DID
NOT
NEED
TO
BE
SAVED

SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND
GEBCADREDSLPITTEDU
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
