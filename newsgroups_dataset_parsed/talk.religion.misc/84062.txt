MIKE
COBB
WRITES
WHY
IS
THE
NT
TOSSED
OUT
AS
INFO
ON
JESUS
I
REALIZE
IT
IS
NORMALLY
TOSSED
OUT
BECAUSE
IT
CONTAINS
MIRACLES
BUT
WHAT
ARE
THE
OTHER
REASONS
FAR
FROM
BEING
TOSSED
OUT
THE
GOSPELS
ARE
TAKEN
ALMOST
UNIVERSALLY
AS
THE
PRIMARY
SOURCE
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
JESUS
I
AM
CURIOUS
AS
TO
WHOM
MIKE
COBB
IS
REFERRING
WHO
TOSSES
OUT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
UNDOUBTEDLY
A
FEW
NAIVE
ATHEISTS
DO
THIS
BUT
THE
PHRASING
OF
THE
QUESTION
ABOVE
SEEMS
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
COBB
ASCRIBES
THIS
MORE
BROADLY
PERHAPS
THE
QUESTION
THAT
GETS
MORE
TO
THE
HEART
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
WHY
EXCEPT
FOR
SOME
NAIVE
BELIEVERS
WHO
UNFORTUNATELY
FAR
OUTNUMBER
NONBELIEVERS
BOTH
NAIVE
AND
CRITICAL
ARE
THE
GOSPELS
NOT
TAKEN
AS
GOSPEL
TRUTH
THAT
FAITHFULLY
RECORDS
JUST
WHAT
HAPPENED
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
AGO
THIS
HAS
AN
EASY
ANSWER
AND
THE
ANSWER
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
MIRACLES
NO
TEXT
IS
TAKEN
THIS
WAY
BY
A
CRITICAL
READER
THERE
IS
A
MYTH
AMONG
SOME
NAIVE
BELIEVERS
THAT
ONE
TAKES
A
TEXT
MEASURES
IT
BY
SOME
SET
OF
CRITERIA
AND
THEN
EITHER
CONFIRMS
THE
TEXT
AS
HISTORICALLY
VALID
OR
TOSSES
OUT
THE
TEXT
I
SUSPECT
THIS
MYTH
COMES
FROM
THE
WAY
HISTORY
IS
PRESENTED
IN
PRIMARY
AND
SECONDARY
SCHOOL
WHERE
CERTAIN
TEXTS
ARE
VESTED
WITH
AUTHORITY
AND
FROM
WRITERS
SUCH
AS
JOSH
MCDOWELL
WHO
PRETEND
TO
PRESENT
HISTORICAL
ARGUMENTS
ALONG
THESE
LINES
FOR
THEIR
RELIGIOUS
PROGRAM
IN
FACT
MOST
TEXTS
USED
IN
PRIMARY
AND
SECONDARY
SCHOOL
HISTORY
CLASSES
OUGHT
TO
BE
TOSSED
OUT
EVEN
THE
BETTER
SUCH
TEXTS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
TREATED
AS
AUTHORITATIVELY
AS
DESCIBED
ABOVE
AND
JOSH
MCDOWELL
WOULD
NOT
KNOW
A
HISTORICAL
ARGUMENT
IF
IT
BIT
HIM
ON
THE
KEISTER
TWICE
LET
ME
PRESENT
THE
BAREST
OUTLINES
OF
A
DIFFERENT
VIEW
OF
TEXTS
AND
THEIR
USE
IN
STUDYING
HISTORY
FIRST
ALL
TEXTS
ARE
HISTORICALLY
VALID
ALL
TEXTS
OR
TO
PUT
THIS
ANOTHER
WAY
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
NOTION
OF
HISTORICAL
VALIDITY
THAT
MAKES
ANY
SENSE
WHEN
APPLIED
TO
A
TEXT
SECOND
NO
TEXT
SHOULD
BE
READ
AS
TELLING
THE
GOSPEL
TRUTH
ABOUT
HISTORICAL
EVENTS
IN
THE
WAY
THAT
MANY
STUDENTS
ARE
WONT
TO
READ
HISTORY
TEXTS
IN
PRIMARY
AND
SECONDARY
SCHOOL
NO
TEXT
THIS
INCLUDES
YOUR
FAVORITE
AUTHORS
HISTORY
OF
WHATEVER
EVERY
TEXT
IS
A
HISTORICAL
FACT
EVERY
TEXT
WAS
WRITTEN
BY
SOME
PERSON
OR
SOME
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
FOR
SOME
PURPOSE
HENCE
EVERY
TEXT
CAN
SERVE
AS
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
CAN
WE
LEARN
FROM
A
TEXT
OF
WHAT
INTERESTING
THINGS
IF
ANY
DOES
THE
TEXT
PROVIDE
EVIDENCE
THE
DIARIES
OF
THE
FOLLOWERS
OF
THE
MAHARISHI
FORMERLY
OF
OREGON
ARE
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
THE
GOSPELS
ARE
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
THE
LETTERS
OF
THE
OFFICERS
WHO
PARTICIPATED
IN
THE
VAMPIRE
INQUESTS
IN
EASTERN
EUROPE
ARE
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
THE
MODERN
AMERICAN
HISTORY
TEXTBOOKS
THAT
WHITEWASH
GREAT
AMERICAN
FIGURES
ARE
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
THESE
ARE
ALL
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
OF
VARIOUS
THINGS
THEY
ARE
NOT
MUCH
EVIDENCE
AT
ALL
THAT
THE
MAHARISHI
FORMERLY
OF
OREGON
COULD
LEVITATE
THAT
JESUS
WAS
RESURRECTED
THAT
VAMPIRES
EXIST
OR
THAT
GREAT
AMERICAN
FIGURES
ARE
AS
SQUEAKY
CLEAN
AS
WE
LEARNED
IN
SCHOOL
THEY
ARE
BETTER
EVIDENCE
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
SAW
THE
MAHARISHI
LATE
OF
OREGON
LEVITATE
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
THOUGHT
JESUS
WAS
RESURRECTED
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
EASTERN
EUROPE
SAW
VAMPIRES
RETURN
FROM
THE
GRAVE
AND
THAT
WE
STILL
HAVE
AN
EDUCATIONAL
SYSTEM
THAT
LARGELY
PREFERS
TO
SPREAD
MYTH
RATHER
THAN
TEACH
HISTORY
HOW
DOES
ONE
DRAW
CAUSAL
CONNECTIONS
AND
INFER
WHAT
A
PIECE
OF
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
TEXT
OR
OTHERWISE
EVINCES
THIS
IS
A
VERY
COMPLEX
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
NO
EASILY
SUMMARIZED
ANSWER
THERE
ARE
MANY
BOOKS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OR
VARIOUS
PARTS
OF
THE
SUBJECT
I
ENJOY
DAVID
HACKETT
FISCHERS
HISTORIANS
FALLACIES
AS
A
GOOD
ANTIDOTE
TO
THE
UNCRITICAL
WAY
IN
WHICH
IT
IS
SO
EASY
TO
READ
TEXTS
PRESENT
HISTORY
ITS
RELATIVELY
CHEAP
ITS
EASY
TO
READ
GIVE
IT
A
TRY
