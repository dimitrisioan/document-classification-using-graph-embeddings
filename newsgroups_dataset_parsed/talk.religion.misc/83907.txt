SATAN
HERE
IS
SOMEONES
BIBLICAL
CLAIM
FOR
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
SATAN
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
THE
PORTION
OF
SCRIPTURE
THAT
YOU
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
ISAIAH
THIS
DOES
SPEAK
OF
THE
MORNING
STAR
WHICH
ACCORDING
TO
YOU
IS
THE
BABYLONIAN
PRINCE
OK
SO
I
TURN
YOUR
ATTENTION
TO
DANIEL
THIS
PASSAGE
CONCERNS
A
REVELATION
OF
PROPHECY
TO
DANIEL
BY
THE
MESSENGER
FROM
GOD
WITHIN
THIS
PASSAGE
THE
MESSENGER
FROM
GOD
SPEAKS
OF
HOW
HE
FOUGHT
FOR
WEEKS
AGAINST
THE
PRINCE
OF
THE
PERSIAN
KINGDOM
OBVIOUSLY
THIS
PRINCE
WAS
NOT
AN
EARTHLY
PRINCE
THIS
PRINCE
OF
THE
PERSIAN
KINGDOM
IS
PROBABLY
ONE
OF
THE
DEMONS
IN
SATANS
HIERARCHY
AS
SUCH
THE
MORNING
STAR
CAN
BE
THE
PRINCE
OF
BABYLON
W
HO
CAN
ALSO
BE
SATAN
ANOTHER
PASSAGE
CONCERNING
SATANS
FALL
FROM
HEAVEN
IS
EZEKIEL
AND
SEPARATELY
DEVIL
CHOSE
TO
TRY
TO
BECOME
GREATER
THAN
GOD
HE
WANTED
TO
SIT
ON
GODS
THRONE
WHEN
THE
DEVIL
WAS
CREATED
HE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
ANGELS
IN
HEAVEN
WE
HAVE
HERE
THREE
DISTINCT
CLAIMS
CONCERNING
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
DEVILS
DECISION
MAKING
A
SPECIFIC
DESIRE
AND
A
PHYSICAL
DESCRIPTION
NOW
IN
SUPPORT
ASIDE
FROM
THE
MINOR
DETAIL
THAT
AN
AUTHOR
SELDOM
WRITES
AN
UNBIASED
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
OPPOSITION
WE
SEE
ISAIAH
ISA
HOW
ART
THOU
FALLEN
FROM
HEAVEN
O
LUCIFER
SON
OF
THE
MORNING
HOW
ART
THOU
CUT
DOWN
TO
THE
GROUND
WHICH
DIDST
WEAKEN
THE
NATIONS
ISA
FOR
THOU
HAST
SAID
IN
THINE
HEART
I
WILL
ASCEND
INTO
HEAVEN
I
WILL
EXALT
MY
THRONE
ABOVE
THE
STARS
OF
GOD
I
WILL
SIT
ALSO
UPON
THE
MOUNT
OF
THE
CONGREGATION
IN
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
NORTH
ISA
I
WILL
ASCEND
ABOVE
THE
HEIGHTS
OF
THE
CLOUDS
I
WILL
BE
LIKE
THE
MOST
HIGH
ISA
YET
THOU
SHALT
BE
BROUGHT
DOWN
TO
HELL
TO
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
PIT
DOESNT
SAY
SITS
ON
GODS
THRONE
SAYS
WILL
EXHAULT
THRONE
ABOVE
THE
STARS
DANIEL
DAN
THEN
SAID
HE
UNTO
ME
FEAR
NOT
DANIEL
FOR
FROM
THE
FIRST
DAY
THAT
THOU
DIDST
SET
THINE
HEART
TO
UNDERSTAND
AND
TO
CHASTEN
THYSELF
BEFORE
THY
GOD
THY
WORDS
WERE
HEARD
AND
I
AM

OF
