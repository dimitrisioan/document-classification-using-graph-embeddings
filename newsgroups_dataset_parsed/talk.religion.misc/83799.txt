kills
doctor
i
addressed
most
of
the
key
issues
in
this
very
long
lines
post
by
dean
kaflowitz
in
two
posts
yesterday
the
first
was
made
into
the
title
post
of
a
new
thread
is
dean
kaflowitz
terminally
ironyimpaired
and
the
second
more
serious
one
appeared
along
the
thread
a
chaney
post
and
a
challenge
reissued
and
revised
both
only
in
talkabortion
but
i
am
posting
its
contents
into
talkreligionmisc
as
soon
as
i
exit
here
this
should
be
enough
for
us
to
thrash
out
for
the
next
week
or
so
the
second
post
really
grapples
with
the
main
bones
of
contention
between
us
the
first
is
more
lighthearted
and
tells
about
such
things
as
kaflowitzdebatingpoints
tm
which
he
continues
to
rack
up
on
both
talkabortion
and
talkreligionmisc
while
setting
followups
to
talkabortion
alone
his
lame
excuse
for
the
latter
policy
is
that
he
gets
a
prompt
as
to
where
to
set
followups
and
does
not
follow
talkreligionmisc
much
this
suggests
that
he
is
being
hypocritical
in
not
also
setting
his
newsgroups
line
to
talkabortion
alone
