re
what
part
of
no
dont
you
understand
in
e
elizabeth
bartley
writes
i
can
certainly
see
opposing
the
amen
but
that
doesnt
require
opposing
a
moment
of
silence
if
the
only
people
proposing
a
moment
of
silence
are
doing
so
as
a
sham
to
sneak
in
prayers
then
it
must
be
opposed
what
the
hell
have
prayers
to
do
with
public
schooling
i
ask
this
question
as
a
devout
christian
ill
back
off
when
they
do
does
anybody
else
besides
me
see
a
vicious
circle
here
i
guarantee
you
the
people
who
want
school
prayer
arent
going
to
back
off
when
they
cant
even
manage
to
get
a
quiet
moment
for
their
kids
to
pray
silently
their
kids
can
bloodywell
pray
any
goddamned
time
they
want
to
and
nothing
on
heaven
or
earth
in
government
or
the
principals
office
can
prevent
or
in
any
other
way
deal
with
their
doing
so
especially
if
the
prayer
is
silent
as
bursting
out
into
the
shema
yisrael
or
some
other
prayer
might
be
construed
as
disruptive
if
audible
no
one
ever
prevented
me
from
praying
in
public
school
they
hardly
even
prevented
me
from
masturbating
in
study
hall
i
should
have
thought
better
of
someone
posting
from
a
uchicago
address
how
can
you
manage
to
say
such
nonsense
without
shame
muslim
students
might
have
a
complaint
if
they
are
prevented
from
setting
out
their
rugs
and
doing
the
proper
ablutions
before
prayer
at
the
times
specified
in
the
quran
jews
would
probably
like
the
opportunity
to
daven
with
tefillim
and
whatever
else
they
require
at
their
appropriate
times
i
do
not
see
them
complaining
though
muslims
and
jews
have
a
case
that
no
christian
i
have
ever
heard
has
been
able
to
make
the
christian
insistence
on
a
public
universal
enforced
moment
of
prayerhhhhhhsilence
is
nothing
but
the
inquisition
naturalized
into
the
american
context
it
is
offensive
to
the
gospel
of
christ

say
