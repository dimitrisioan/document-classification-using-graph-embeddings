i
find
myself
unable
to
put
these
two
statements
together
in
a
sensible
way
abortion
is
done
because
the
mother
can
not
afford
the
pregnancy
if
we
refused
to
pay
for
the
more
expensive
choice
of
birth
then
your
statement
would
make
sense
but
that
is
not
the
case
so
it
doesnt
are
we
paying
for
the
birth
or
not
mr
parker
if
so
why
cant
the
mother
afford
the
pregnancy
if
not
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
latter
objection
you
cant
have
it
both
ways
birth
pregnancy
if
they
were
the
same
the
topic
of
abortion
would
hardly
arise
would
it
