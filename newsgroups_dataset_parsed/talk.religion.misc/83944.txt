RE
IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED
BRIAN
CECCARELLI
WROTE
THATS
ME
KENT
I
AM
NOT
ACCUSING
YOU
OF
EVIL
THINGS
JESUS
IS
ACCUSING
YOU
AND
IT
IS
NOT
ONLY
YOU
THAT
HE
IS
ACCUSING
HE
IS
ACCUSING
EVERYONE
ME
YOU
AND
EVERYONE
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
GUILTY
WHETHER
ONE
SEES
THE
LIGHT
OR
DOES
NOT
SEEN
THE
LIGHT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
WHETHER
WE
DO
EVIL
THINGS
WE
DO
THEM
REGARDLESS
KENT
SANDVIK
RESPONDS
HMM
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CORE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
FEEL
GUILTY
I
THINK
I
SEE
WHERE
YOU
ARE
COMING
FROM
KENT
JESUS
DOESNT
VIEW
GUILT
LIKE
OUR
MODERN
VENACULAR
COLORS
IT
FEELINGS
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
GUILT
FEELINGS
ARISE
FROM
THE
STATE
OF
BEING
GUILTY
FEELING
AND
GUILT
ARE
MUTALLY
EXCLUSIVE
FEELINGS
ARE
A
REACTION
FROM
GUILT
JESUS
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
GUILT
STATE
NOT
THE
REACTION
LET
ME
GIVE
YOU
AN
EXAMPLE
HAVE
YOU
EVER
MADE
A
MISTAKE
HAVE
YOU
EVER
LIED
TO
SOMEONE
EVEN
A
LITTLE
WHITE
LIE
HAVE
YOU
EVER
CLAIMED
TO
KNOW
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
REALLY
DIDNT
KNOW
HAVE
YOU
EVER
HATED
SOMEONE
HAVE
YOU
EVER
BEEN
SELFISH
ARE
YOU
GUILTY
OF
ANY
ONE
OF
THESE
THE
ANSWER
IS
OF
COURSE
YES
YOU
ARE
GUILTY
PERIOD
THAT
IS
IT
WHAT
JESUS
IS
GETTING
AT
NO
BIG
SURPRISE
FEELINGS
DO
NOT
EVEN
ENTER
THE
PICTURE
CONSIDER
JESUSS
USE
OF
THE
WORD
GUILT
AS
HOW
A
COURT
USES
IT
JESUS
IS
CONCERNED
THAT
EVERYONE
SHOULD
ADMIT
THAT
THEY
ARE
GUILTY
OF
BEING
IMPERFECT
THE
BIBLE
CALLS
IT
THE
STATE
THAT
WE
ARE
ALL
SINNERS
WE
ALL
DO
BAD
THINGS
EVEN
THE
MOST
INSIGNFICANT
THING
THAT
WE
DO
WRONG
IS
PROOF
OF
OUR
GUILT
THAT
WE
ARE
ALL
SINNERS
IT
IS
IT
IN
OUR
NATURE
TO
DO
BAD
THINGS
WE
ARE
SINNERS
THEREFORE
WE
DO
BAD
THINGS
BEING
A
SINNER
IS
FACT
IT
IS
NOT
A
PLEASANT
FACT
BUT
IT
IS
JUST
A
FACT
WE
ARE
NOT
PERFECT
CALLING
US
SINNERS
SHOULD
HAVE
NO
MORE
EMOTIONAL
CHARGE
TO
YOU
THAN
CALLING
YOU
A
HUMAN
BEING
GUILTY
AS
CHARGED
AND
THEN
THERES
THIS
SINGLE
PERSONALITY
THAT
WILL
SAVE
YOU
FROM
THIS
UNIVERSAL
GUILT
FEELING
YOU
CAN
HANDLE
YOUR
GUILT
IN
ONE
OF
TWO
WAYS
ACKNOWLEDGE
YOU
MADE
A
MISTAKE
LEARN
FROM
IT
AND
TRY
TO
NOT
DO
IT
AGAININ
THE
MEANTIME
NOT
PUNISHING
YOURSELF
FOR
IT
WHICH
IS
THE
WAY
JESUS
WANTS
YOU
TO
HANDLE
OR
IT
THIS
IS
THE
HEALTHY
WAY
OR
TWO
THE
DESTRUCTIVE
WAY
PUT
YOURSELF
DOWN
SLAP
YOURSELF
AND
FEEL
LIKE
CRAP
NEVER
FORGIVE
YOURSELF
FORCE
YOURSELF
TO
SAY
A
THOUSAND
HAIL
MARYS
EVEN
TO
SUICIDE
THIS
THE
WAY
JESUS
DOES
NOT
WANT
US
TO
DEAL
WITH
IT
ALL
PEOPLE
FALL
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
TO
SOME
EXTENT
IN
THEIR
LIVES
JESUS
IS
NOT
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
SAVING
US
FROM
THIS
GUILT
FEELING
JESUS
IS
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
SHOWING
US
HOW
MUCH
HE
LOVES
US
DESPITE
OUR
GUILT
JESUS
KNOWS
WE
ARE
GUILTY
THAT
ISNT
NEW
TO
HIM
IT
IS
NO
BIG
DEAL
TO
HIM
HE
JUST
WANTS
YOU
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THIS
SINFUL
NATURE
DESTROYS
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
YOU
AND
HIM
THAT
IS
WHAT
HE
WANTS
YOU
TO
KNOW
WHY
BECAUSE
HE
WANTS
TO
HAVE
YOUR
COMPANY
YOU
ARE
IMMENSELY
VALUABLE
TO
HIM
JESUS
WANTS
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
YOU
HOWEVER
IN
OUR
PRESENT
SINFUL
NATURE
WE
ARE
INCAPABLE
OF
HAVING
THIS
RELATIONSHIP
GOD
IS
PERFECT
WE
ARE
NOT
YOU
CANNOT
FIT
A
SQUARE
PEG
INTO
A
ROUND
HOLE
HOWEVER
GOD
HAS
PROVIDED
A
WAY
FOR
US
TO
CHANGE
OUR
NATURE
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
HAVE
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
HIM
GOD
HAS
PROVIDED
JESUS
SO
THAT
WHOSOEVER
JUST
BELIEVES
IN
JESUS
WILL
HAVE
THEIR
NATURE
CHANGED
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
WILL
MOVE
IT
AND
NOW
DIVINE
NATURE
IS
NOW
WITHIN
LIVES
OUR
VERY
BEINGAND
US
AND
GOD
COMMUNICATE
WITH
EACH
THROUGH
HIS
UNIFYING
HOLY
SPIRIT
THE
BENEFITS
OF
THIS
ARE
ENDLESS
FOR
WITH
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
LIVING
WITHIN
US
WE
CAN
NOW
SEE
OUR
IMPERFECTIONS
BETTER
WE
CAN
NOW
HEAD
THEM
OFF
AT
THE
PASS
WITH
THE
POWER
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
LIVING
IN
US
WE
NOW
HAVE
HIS
POWER
TO
HELP
US
OVERCOME
OUR
SHORTCOMINGS
BECAUSE
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
LIVES
WITHIN
US
WE
CAN
NOW
UNDERSTAND
PROFOUND
BIBLE
PASSAGES
THAT
NEVER
BEFORE
WE
COULD
UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
NOW
LIVES
WITHIN
US
WE
NOW
HAVE
AUTHORITY
OVER
DEMONIC
FORCES
AND
LASTLY
BECAUSE
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
NOW
LIVES
WITHIN
US
WE
HAVE
ETERNAL
LIFEFOR
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IS
ETERNAL
THE
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
JESUS
IS
OF
THE
UTMOST
IMPORTANCE
BECAUSE
IT
IS
NOT
WHAT
YOU
DO
IN
LIFE
THAT
QUALIFIES
YOU
TO
BELONG
TO
HEAVENLY
KINGDOM
IT
IS
YOUR
RELATIONSHIP
TO
THE
LIVING
GOD
REMEMBER
WHAT
JESUS
SAID
AT
THE
TAIL
END
OF
MATTHEW
WHEN
HE
SEPARATED
THE
GOATS
FROM
THE
SHEEP
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
THE
LAST
DAY
WILL
ASK
HIM
DIDNT
I
PROPHESY
IN
YOUR
NAME
AND
DO
MIRACLES
AND
DO
GOOD
THINGS
IN
YOUR
NAME
AND
WHAT
DID
JESUS
SAY
DEPART
FROM
ME
FOR
I
NEVER
KNEW
YOU
THAT
IS
THE
CORNERSTONE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
KENT
JESUS
MUST
KNOW
YOU
AS
HIS
FRIEND
IT
IS
YOUR
RELATIONSHIP
TO
JESUS
IF
HE
IS
YOUR
FRIEND
AND
YOU
ARE
HIS
YOU
WILL
BE
COUNTED
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
WILL
SHARE
IN
HIS
INHERITANCE
IN
HEAVEN
BRIAN
I
WILL
TELL
YOU
A
SECRET
I
DONT
FEEL
GUILTY
AT
ALL
I
DO
MISTAKES
AND
I
REGRET
THEM
HOWEVER
IVE
NEVER
HAD
THIS
HUGE
GUILT
FEELING
HANGING
OVER
MY
SHOULDER
GOOD
IT
SHOWS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
STRONG
SELFIMAGETHAT
YOU
LOVE
YOURSELF
THAT
IS
THE
SECOND
GREATEST
COMMANDMENT
JESUS
TAUGHT
IF
ONLY
MORE
PEOPLE
COULD
DO
AS
YOU
DO
AS
I
SAID
BEFORE
IN
THE
COMMON
ENGLISH
VENACULAR
FEELING
GUILTY
HAS
A
DIFFERENT
MEANING
THAN
THE
STATE
OF
GUILT
THIS
ALL
IS
A
VERY
CLEAR
INDICATION
THAT
YOU
NEED
A
CERTAIN
PERSONALITY
TYPE
IN
ORDER
TO
BELIEVE
AND
ADJUST
TO
CERTAIN
RELIGIOUS
DOCTRINES
AND
IF
YOUR
PERSONALITY
TYPE
IS
OPPOSITE
THEN
YOU
ARE
NOT
THAT
EASILY
ATTACHED
TO
A
CERTAIN
WORLD
VIEW
SYSTEM
I
BELIEVE
WHAT
WE
ALL
NEED
IN
OUR
PERSONALITIES
IS
A
LOT
LESS
EGO
A
LOT
LESS
SELFCENTEREDNESS
AND
A
LOT
MORE
UNCONDITIONAL
LOVE
THERE
ARE
HUMANS
THAT
SUBSCRIBE
TO
THE
SAME
NOTION
THE
NICE
THING
IS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
FINALLY
SHAKE
OFF
THIS
HUGE
BURDEN
THE
SHOULDERS
FEEL
FAR
MORE
RELAXED
YES
YOU
HAVE
STATED
WHAT
JESUS
SAID
REMEMBER
COME
TO
ME
TAKE
MY
YOKE
UPON
YOUR
SHOULDERS
FOR
MY
BURDEN
IS
LIGHT
A
YOKE
IS
USED
TO
DIRECT
OXEN
TO
DO
WORK
ONCE
YOU
HAVE
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
JESUS
YOU
AND
HIM
SHARE
THE
YOKE
AND
THE
BURDENS
OF
LIFE
HAVING
GOD
AT
YOUR
SIDE
IS
OF
GREAT
ADVANTAGE
