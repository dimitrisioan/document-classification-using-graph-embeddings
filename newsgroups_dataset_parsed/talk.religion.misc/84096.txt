i
told
some
friends
of
mine
two
weeks
ago
that
koresh
was
dead
the
fbi
and
the
batf
could
not
let
a
man
like
that
live
he
was
a
testimonial
to
their
stupidity
and
lies
deleted
unfortunately
i
think
youve
got
it
figured
pretty
well
i
also
ask
myself
the
question
why
did
they
plan
for
so
many
months
why
was
this
so
important
to
them
what
was
the
government
really
up
to
why
did
they
seal
the
warrant
were
they
after
koresh
or
were
they
after
the
first
and
second
amendments
among
others
allow
me
to
play
devils
advocate
a
moment
jg
didnt
expect
to
find
you
in
the
devils
role
stephen
but
these
are
the
times
that
try
mens
souls
o
what
was
called
many
months
of
planning
was
probably
the
intelligence
collecting
paperwork
and
interviews
nine
months
as
i
understand
it
no
doubt
this
accounts
for
a
significant
amount
of
the
time
as
government
efficiency
in
spending
our
tax
dollars
would
certainly
seek
its
absolute
minimum
in
such
an
event
but
my
gut
instinct
says
there
is
more
at
hand
it
took
some
careful
preplanning
to
demonize
dk
to
such
an
extent
the
attack
meshes
well
with
more
restrictive
gun
control
legislation
that
seems
to
be
the
agenda
of
the
day
it
also
fits
a
pattern
of
increased
government
interference
in
personal
religious
beliefs
randy
weaver
is
now
on
trial
o
its
important
to
them
because
it
justifies
budgets
no
quarrel
here
the
big
bang
theory
is
always
apt
at
appropriation
time
they
just
dont
have
to
possess
a
single
motive
o
the
warrant
was
sealed
to
keep
from
jeopardizing
the
the
governments
case
i
certainly
think
publication
of
the
warrant
undermines
the
governments
case
since
it
makes
no
claims
of
illegal
action
therefore
the
federal
judge
had
reason
to
seal
it
but
i
am
reminded
of
senator
frank
churchs
remark
that
secrecy
is
the
trademark
of
a
totalitarian
government
there
is
rarely
sufficient
motive
to
seal
a
warrant
in
a
nation
of
free
people
o
there
was
probably
no
one
actually
exercising
oversite
instead
a
system
of
bureaucratic
rules
has
been
set
up
for
such
incidents
like
computer
programs
these
have
to
be
debugged
periodically
especially
when
used
in
fringe
areas
cf
the
hostage
rescue
program
therefore
no
one
was
in
charge
and
no
one
can
reasonably
be
held
responsible
how
can
i
argue
with
irrefutable
logic
i
have
long
suspected
that
the
government
has
become
a
mindless
machine
and
now
you
go
and
confirm
my
worst
fears
has
it
become
a
beast
that
is
programmed
simply
to
say
kiss
my
toe
and
you
get
your
piece
of
the
pie
i
suspect
bugs
in
the
program
arise
when
agents
or
those
who
love
this
critter
have
independent
thoughts
o
what
they
were
after
generally
speaking
is
protecting
their
jobs
budgets
and
paychecks
and
watching
terminator
ii
we
waited
days
for
our
hostages
to
come
home
from
iran
we
gave
these
people
days
died
at
the
alamo
died
that
day
in
waco
yes
seeds
for
a
new
republic
and
for
rev
and
they
of
the
people
and
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
shall
see
their
dead
bodies
three
days
and
an
half
and
shall
not
suffer
their
dead
bodies
to
be
put
in
graves
why
no
burial
is
is
that
the
bodies
of
the
witnesses
will
be
said
to
be
property
of
the
state
or
just
a
typical
bureaucratic
delay
rev
they
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
rejoice
over
them
and
make
merry
and
shall
send
gifts
one
to
another
because
these
two
prophets
tormented
them
that
dwelt
on
the
earth
stephen
have
you
sensed
that
some
have
been
rejoicing
lately
