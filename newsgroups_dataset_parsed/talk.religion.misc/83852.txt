KEVIN
OSINSKI
WRITES
I
RECALL
READING
IN
MICHAEL
RUTHERFORDS
NOVEL
SARUM
A
SCENE
IN
WHICH
THE
SON
OF
A
ROMAN
NOBLEMAN
LIVING
IN
BRITAIN
TAKES
PART
IN
A
SECRET
CEREMONY
INVOLVING
A
BULL
HE
STANDS
NAKED
IN
A
PIT
COVERED
WITH
SOME
SORT
OF
SCAFFOLDING
WHILE
ASSISTANTS
COAX
A
BULL
TO
STAND
ON
THE
SCAFFOLDING
THEY
THEN
FATALLY
STAB
THE
BULL
WHICH
DOUSES
THE
WORSHIPPER
IN
THE
PIT
WITH
BLOOD
THIS
IS
SUPPOSEDLY
SOME
SORT
OF
RITE
OF
PASSAGE
FOR
MEMBERS
OF
THE
BULL
CULT
I
WONDER
IF
THIS
IS
RELATED
TO
THE
MITHRAS
CULT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
RUTHERFORD
GOT
HIS
INFORMATION
FOR
THIS
CHAPTER
THE
BOOK
IS
HISTORICAL
FICTION
AND
MOST
OF
THE
GENERAL
EVENTS
WHICH
TAKE
PLACE
ARE
LARGELY
BASED
ON
HISTORICAL
ACCOUNTS
THERE
IS
A
RITE
LIKE
THIS
DESCRIBED
IN
JOSEPH
CAMPBELLS
OCCIDENTALMYTHOLOGY
HE
ALSO
DESCRIBED
LEVELS
OF
INITIATION
I
THINK
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
CAMPBELL
GOT
HIS
INFO
BUT
I
REMEMBER
THINKING
HE
WAS
BEING
A
LITTLE
ECLECTIC
I
ALSO
WONDER
WHAT
IF
ANY
CONNECTION
THERE
IS
BETWEEN
THE
ANCIENT
BULL
CULTS
AND
THE
CURRENT
PRACTICE
OF
BULLFIGHTING
POPULAR
IN
SOME
MEDITERRANEAN
CULTURES
QUITE
A
