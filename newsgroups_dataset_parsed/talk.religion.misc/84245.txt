cybele
and
transgendersexualism
charles
hope
writes
rome
was
under
attack
by
barbarians
they
sent
for
advice
to
some
oracle
and
she
said
worship
cybele
and
youll
be
saved
they
did
they
were
cybele
was
the
quintessential
wiccan
goddess
there
was
her
and
her
son
lover
attis
yucky
idea
if
you
ask
me
ok
the
book
says
she
was
phrygian
from
the
neolithic
matriarchal
society
catal
huyuk
turkey
worshipped
as
black
stone
that
kaaba
in
mecca
ring
a
bell
maybe
carried
to
rome
in
to
save
them
from
hannibal
response
is
there
some
relation
between
the
name
cybele
and
the
phenemenon
of
the
sibyl
your
paragraph
above
seems
to
indicate
there
might
be
my
understanding
is
that
islam
was
founded
on
the
remains
of
a
goddess
cult
or
two
many
muslims
would
not
like
to
hear
that
you
it
gets
more
interesting
romans
called
her
great
mother
magna
mater
could
be
the
reason
why
so
many
of
those
mary
statues
in
europe
are
black
prob
is
connected
to
that
kaaba
theyve
got
in
mecca
cent
ad
she
was
supreme
goddess
in
lyons
france
attis
was
castrated
and
formed
into
a
pine
tree
she
should
be
worshiped
on
mar
in
rome
it
was
an
ecstatic
cult
her
priests
wore
drag
worked
themselves
up
in
dance
and
castrated
themselves
in
order
to
initiate
to
her
lived
their
lives
as
women
they
wore
make
up
and
jewelry
and
the
whole
bit
only
other
such
primitive
transsexualism
i
know
of
goes
on
in
india
where
else
where
they
do
that
castration
thing
under
some
meditation
maybe
i
forget
by
nowtheres
a
book
on
that
of
course
that
excepts
that
weird
russian
romanian
cent
xian
cult
that
did
all
kinds
of
selfcastration
too
i
forget
their
name
response
id
love
to
get
details
or
references
on
any
of
the
above
my
own
exploration
of
this
issue
has
only
extended
to
a
brief
examination
of
the
zuni
berdache
the
zuni
manwoman
by
will
roscoe
university
of
new
mexico
press
probably
has
some
interesting
things
to
say
about
them
ive
yet
to
procure
it
any
details
or
references
on
ecstatic
cults
in
rome
india
russiaromania
christian
too
which
exhibit
any
type
of
transsexualism
or
transvestitism
male
or
female
though
i
expect
mostly
the
former
will
be
found
thanks
for
your
interesting
posts
charles
will
love
come
as
you
like
shall
be
the
whole
of
