ROSICRUCIAN
ORDERS
KENT
WITH
ALL
DUE
RESPECT
HOW
CAN
I
TAKE
YOU
SERIOUSLY
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
THE
NAMES
WRONG
IN
THE
PLACE
EG
THE
SAN
JOSE
RC
ORDO
ROSAE
CRUCIS
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
THE
CORRECT
NAME
IS
ANCIENT
MYSTICAL
ORDER
ROSAE
CRUCIS
ABBREVIATED
AMORC
AND
THE
ROCICRUSIAN
ORDER
CREATED
BY
MAX
HEINDEL
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
EITHER
ITS
THE
ROSICRUCIAN
FELLOWSHIP

CLEARLY
STATE
THAT
THEY
DO
NOT
PRETEND
TO
DESCEND
FROM
THE
ORDER

THE
FAMA
FRATERNITATIS
IN
ADDITION
THERE
ARE
MANY
SPLINTER
GROUPS
ALL
AROUND
EUROPE
THAT
ALL
CLAIM
SOME
CONNECTION
WITH
THE
ORIGINAL

FOUNDED

THE
MIDDLE
AGES

WHO
ELSE
SOME
FREEMASON
GROUPS
ALSO
HAVE
ROSICRUCIANLIKE
SEPARATE
GROUPS
EVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
FAR
FROM
THE
IDEOLOGIES
THE
RC

HAVE
SOMEHOW
IN
COMMON
THESE
ARE
NOT
ROSICRUCIAN
ORDERS
THEY
ARE
MASONIC
STUDY
GROUPS
NONE
OF
WHICH
CLAIMS
TO
BE
DESCENDANT
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
ORDER
WE
MIGHT
COMPETE
ABOUT
HOW
MUCH
TIME
WE
HAVE
SPENT
WITH
THIS
