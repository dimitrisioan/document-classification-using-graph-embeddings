MR

ABDELRAHEM
WRITES
I
URGE
YOU
ALL
TO
VOTE
NO
TO
THE
FORMATION
OF
THE
NEWS
GROUP
AHMADYAISLAM
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
GROUP
THE
WORD
ISLAM
SHOULDNOT
BE
ATTACHED
TO
THE
NAME
OF
SUCH
GROUP
WE
DONT
CONSIDER
THEM
AS
MUSLIMS
DR
TAHIR
IJAZ
COMMENTS
ON
ESAM
ABDELRAHEMS
STATEMENT
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
WE
CONSIDER
OURSELF
TO
BE
MUSLIMS
EVEN
THOUGH
YOU
DONT
LUCKILY
FAITH
IS
DETERMINED
BY
WHAT
ONE
BELIEVES
AND
IS
A
PERSONAL
MATTER
YOU
CANNOT
DECLARE
THE
FAITH
OF
SOMEONE
ELSE
MR
JAWAD
ALI
THEN
COMMENTS
ON
TAHIR
IJAZS
STATEMENT
YOU
ARE
NOT
CONSIDERING
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
YOUR
ARGUMENT
THE
CONVERSE
WOULD
BE
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
MUSLIMS
DONT
CONSIDER
AHMADIES
TO
BE
MUSLIMS
WHO
ONE
CONSIDERS
TO
BE
ONES
COBELIEVER
IS
ALSO
A
PERSONAL
MATTER
IT
WOULD
BE
JUST
AS
WRONG
TO
TELL
THE
MUSLIMS
WHO
SHOULD
BE
INCLUDED
IN
THEIR
SELFDEFINATION
THE
ARGUMENT
BY
JAWAD
ALI
IS
FUNNY
HE
WRITES
THE
CONVERSE
WOULD
BE
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
MUSLIMS
DONT
CONSIDER
AHMADIES
TO
BE
MUSLIMS
WHICH
IS
A
WRONG
STATEMENT
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
DR
IJAZS
STATEMENT
THE
ABOVE
STATEMENT
SHOULD
BE
CORRECTED
IS
THAT
SOME
NONAHMADI
MUSLIMS
DONT
CONSIDER
AHMADIMUSLIMS
AS
MUSLIMS
SO
THE
PROBLEM
DOES
NOT
GET
SOLVED
WHO
IS
A
MUSLIMS
AND
WHO
IS
NOT
HUMANS
CANNOT
DECIDE
HUMANS
MAY
NOT
DECLARE
OTHERS
FAITHS
ITS
THAT
SIMPLE
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THE
MERE
USE
OF
THE
WORD
ISLAM
IS
BECOMMING
SUCH
A
BIG
ISSUE
I
HAVE
SEEN
NUMOROUS
POSTINGS
ON
THE
NET
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
AND
ALL
THEY
SAY
NO
NO
YOU
CANNOT
USE
ISLAM
AS
THE
NAME
OF
YOUR
NEWSGROUP
I
HAVENT
SEEN
A
SINGLE
POSTING
STATING
WHAT
RIGHT
DO
THEY
HAVE
IN
DECLARING
THE
NAME
OF
OTHERS
FAITHS
WHO
GIVES
THEM
THIS
AUTHORITY
QURAN
OR
HADITH
OR
SOMETHING
ELSE
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
THIS
JUST
A
SMALL
REMINDER
TO
ALL
MY
MUSLIM
BROTHERS
DID
EVER
THE
HOLY
PROPHET
OF
ISLAM
MUHAMMAD
PBUH
SAY
TO
ANYONE
WHO
CALLED
HIMSELF
A
MUSLIM
NO
YOU
ARE
NOT
A
MUSLIM
NEVER
I
CHALLENGE
ALL
MY
MUSLIM
BROTHERS
TO
PRODUCE
A
SINGLE
SUCH
EVIDENCE
FROM
THE
HISTORY
OF
ISLAM
HENCE
IF
THE
PROPHET
MUHAMMAD
COULD
NEVER
DO
THAT
TO
ANYONE
HOW
COULD
THE
MUSLIMS
MULLAHS
OR
EVEN
GOVERNMENTS
OF
TODAY
DO
IT
TO
ANYONE
DO
YOU
CONSIDER
YOURSELF
ABOVE
THE
HOLY
PROPHET
MUHAMMAD
