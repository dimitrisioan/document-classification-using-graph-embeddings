remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
jews
wont
agree
with
you
malcolm
which
jews
ks
most
religious
jews
with
the
exception
of
the
messianic
ones
and
atheistsagnostics
malcolm
ks
i
see
youre
wanting
malcolms
response
allow
me
one
last
inter
jection
then
please
distinguishing
among
the
religious
jews
youve
excepted
the
messianic
for
obvious
reasons
specifically
are
you
saying
its
these
religious
jews
who
trace
their
lineage
back
to
abraham
by
blood
and
orthodoxy
rather
than
by
faith
who
wont
agree
orthodox
jews
as
to
the
aa
if
i
understand
your
direction
the
issue
remains
unproven
i
suspect
considering
how
atheists
and
agnostics
so
often
look
to
reason
atheist
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
will
not
agree
for
agnostics
a
poll
seems
in
order
who
knows
myself
im
not
so
sure
the
atheists
can
be
counted
out
for
the
orthodox
i
wonder
how
many
would
follow
moses
or
abraham
or
david
in
accepting
gods
word
is
the
particular
covenant
to
which
one
adheres
more
important
than
god
promisimg
i
reckon
for
many
it
depends
on
the
ongoing
dialogue
under
these
considerations
you
might
understand
why
i
think
its
premature
to
assert
who
will
and
wont
agree
