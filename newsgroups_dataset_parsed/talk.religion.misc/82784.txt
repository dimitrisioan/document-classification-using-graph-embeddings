RE
QUESTION
FOR
THOSE
WITH
POPULAR
MORALITY
HUDSON
AND
FROM
A
MATERIALISTIC
POINT
OF
VIEW
IT
COULD
BE
SAID
THAT
THE
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
IS
JUST
MATTER
WHAT
IS
WRONG
WITH
PRODUCING
CHEMICAL
REACTIONS
IN
MATTER
BECAUSE
THIS
MATTER
IS
DIFFERENT
IT
IS
ALIVE
AND
SELFAWARE
AND
IT
FEELS
PAIN
HUDSON
IF
ALL
MORALITY
WERE
RELATIVE
BIG
HAIRY
DEAL
AS
I
SAID
YOU
APPEAR
TO
BE
THE
ONLY
PERSON
SAYING
THAT
ALL
MORALITY
IS
RELATIVE
MOST
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
DO
HOLD
SOME
ABSOLUTES
IN
THEIR
MORAL
SYSTEM
I
PERSONALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
DIGNITY
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
AND
THE
RIGHT
OF
FREE
WILL
ARE
ABSOLUTES
I
RECOGNIZE
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
MORAL
SYSTEMS
AROUND
WHICH
DONT
ACCEPT
THIS
I
REJECT
THEM
AS
DANGEROUS
AND
ANTISOCIAL
NAZISM
SOME
FORMS
OF
COMMUNISM
FUNDAMENTALIST
XTIANITYNO
THATS
NOT
A
SLAM
BUT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
ALMOST
EVERY
MORAL
SYSTEM
AGREES
ON
THESE
TWO
POINTS
ME
AND
THE
SKY
AND
EVERYTHING
IN
IT
EVERYTHING
THAT
WAS
CREATED
CAME
OUT
OF
GOD
EVERYTHING
INCLUDING
THIS
MATTER
IS
PART
OF
GOD
THEREFORE
IS
IT
WRONG
TO
PUT
PARTS
OF
GOD
IN
A
TEST
TUBE
AND
MAKE
IT
GO
THROUGH
REACTIONS
ISNT
THAT
A
FORM
OF
BLASPHEMY
HUDSON
GENERALLY
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
IN
A
CREATORCREATION
DISTINCTION
OTHER
RELIGIONS
BELIEVE
IN
ONE
BIG
WHOLE
I
DONT
ACCEPT
YOR
PREMISES
TOO
BAD
I
KNOW
IM
RIGHT
SO
I
GET
TO
ENFORCE
MY
VIEW
UPON
YOU
WHETHER
YOU
LIKE
MY
PREMISE
OR
NOT
AND
SINCE
YOU
CANT
PROVE
OTHERWISE
THERE
ISNT
EVEN
AN
INTELLECTUAL
BASIS
FOR
YOUR
RESISTANCE
TO
ACCEPTING
MY
VIEWPOINT
HUDSON
HOW
LONG
WILL
IT
BE
BEFORE
THE
AS
LONG
AS
IT
DOESNT
HURT
SOMEONE
ELSE
BECOMES
MORE
AND
MORE
RELATIVE
UNTIL
THE
ONLY
RULE
THAT
IS
LEFT
IS
I
WILL
DO
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
DO
NO
MATTER
WHO
IT
HURTS
THERES
A
BIG
JUMP
BETWEEN
THOSE
TWO
POSITIONS
AND
YOU
KNOW
IT
VERY
WELL
DONT
PLAY
STUPID
I
REALIZE
THAT
YOURE
TRYING
TO
DISPUTE
WHAT
YOU
CALL
POPULAR
MORALITY
BY
USING
WHAT
YOU
THINK
IS
LOGIC
BUT
YOURE
STRETCHING
THIS
A
BIT
TOO
THIN
HUDSON
I
DONT
THINK
SO
ONCE
MORALITY
BECOMES
RELATIVE
IT
DEGENERATES
I
AM
SAYING
THAT
REASONING
THAT
IT
IS
GENERALLY
EVIL
TO
HURT
OTHER
PEOPLE
IS
BAD
THOUGH
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
SUFFICIENT
WELL
THEN
ANSWER
ME
THIS
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
OPPOSED
TO
MORAL
RELATIVISM
AS
YOU
CALL
IT
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
THE
CAPACITY
TO
DEGENERATE
OBVIOUSLY
THEN
YOU
WOULD
ADVOCATE
A
NONRELATIVE
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
SYSTEM
WHOSE
ABSOLUTIST
MORAL
SYSTEM
DO
WE
CHOOSE
HOW
DO
WE
COME
TO
THIS
DECISION
WHAT
ABOUT
PEOPLE
WHO
DISAGREE
WITH
THE
CHOSEN
MORAL
SYSTEM
HUDSON
BUT
IF
MORALITY
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
RELATIVE
AND
THIS
RULE
ISNT
BASED
ON
ANYTHING
BUT
IS
JUST
AN
ARBITRARY
RULE
PEOPLE
MIGHT
ABANDON
IT
FINE
I
CAN
AGREE
WITH
MOST
OF
WHAT
YOU
TYPED
HERE
HOWEVER
JUST
BECAUSE
MORALITY
GETS
BASED
ON
SOMETHING
NONRELATIVE
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
PICK
YOUR
XTIANITY
AS
ITS
BASE
WE
CAN
START
A
MORALITY
BASED
ON
DIGNITY
OF
HUMANS
FREEDOM
OF
CHOICE
TOLERANCE
ETC
AND
NEVER
EVER
RELY
ON
XTIANITY
FOR
ANYTHING
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
HAS
A
CONSISTENT
MORAL
SYSTEM
BASED
ON
TRUE
PRINCIPLES
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
INVOLVE
XTIANITY
IN
IT
XTIANITY
CERTAINLY
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
MONOPOLY
ON
PRINCIPLES
OF
BEHAVIOR
INDEED
FEWER
RELIGIONS
ARE
GUILTIER
OF
VIOLATING
THEIR
OWN
PRINCIPLES
