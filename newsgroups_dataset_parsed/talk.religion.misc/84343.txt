id
like
to
know
what
relativism
concludes
when
two
people
grotesquely
disagree
is
it
a
both
are
right
b
one
of
them
is
wrong
and
sometimes
though
perhaps
rarely
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
who
it
is
c
one
of
them
is
wrong
but
we
never
have
any
information
as
to
who
so
we
make
our
best
guess
if
we
really
must
make
a
decision
d
the
idea
of
a
right
moral
judgement
is
meaningless
implying
that
whether
peace
is
better
than
war
eg
is
a
meaningless
question
and
need
not
be
discussed
for
it
has
no
correct
answer
e
something
else
a
short
positive
assertion
would
be
nice
from
whose
point
of
view
would
you
like
to
know
what
relativism
concludes
one
of
the
people
involved
in
the
argument
or
some
third
person
observing
the
arguers
ive
just
come
from
responding
another
of
your
posts
where
some
pennies
have
dropped
for
me
but
it
would
clarify
further
if
you
would
answer
from
the
point
of
view
of
any
disinterested
observers
perhaps
an
observer
as
likely
to
be
in
position
a
as
in
position
b
where
a
and
b
disagree
in
the
future
and
have
his
or
her
conclusion
now
binding
on
them
at
that
time
well
if
our
observer
x
is
as
likely
to
be
in
as
position
as
bs
and
if
he
agrees
that
both
a
and
b
are
making
appropriate
observations
and
inferences
regarding
the
situation
then
i
would
expect
him
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
right
answer
hopefully
there
would
be
some
other
factor
which
would
allow
him
to
make
some
judgement
regarding
which
answer
to
accept
if
on
the
other
hand
he
disagrees
with
the
principles
of
either
a
or
b
i
suspect
he
would
make
a
decision
in
favour
of
the
other
one
it
is
unfortunately
the
case
that
not
all
moral
arguments
have
answers
from
all
perspectives
for
instance
i
am
completely
unable
to
come
to
any
conclusion
regarding
whether
abortion
should
be
allowed
or
not
from
my
perspective
in
an
ideal
world
all
living
things
would
have
a
right
to
life
but
in
an
ideal
world
women
would
have
the
absolute
right
to
do
what
they
like
with
their
own
bodies
clearly
there
is
no
way
to
resolve
in
favour
of
both
these
principles
therefore
i
agree
with
the
compromise
solution
of
allowing
abortion
up
to
a
certain
time
after
conception
and
deciding
on
the
time
based
on
various
sometimes
illdefined
criteria
this
is
also
a
sensible
move
i
think
because
it
lets
people
make
their
own
decisions
within
reason
and
for
what
its
worth
i
am
reasonably
happy
with
current
uk
abortion
law
similarly
the
situation
in
whats
left
of
yugoslavia
is
a
horrible
mess
and
i
really
cant
see
my
way
to
any
sort
of
conclusion
there
i
dont
even
know
enough
to
imagine
what
sort
of
compromise
one
might
manage
