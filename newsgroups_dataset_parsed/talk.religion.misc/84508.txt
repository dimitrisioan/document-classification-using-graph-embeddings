RE
IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED
IN
ARTICLE
BRIANLPLARIZONAEDU
BRIAN
CECCARELLI
WRITES
A
BABYS
INNOCENCE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
WHETHER
THE
BABY
IS
A
SINNER
INNOCENCE
AND
THE
SIN
NATURE
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
ATTRIBUTES
THE
BABY
IS
INNOCENT
YET
THE
BABY
IS
A
SINNER
YOU
HAVE
TWO
ARMS
AND
TWO
LEGS
WHY
BECAUSE
YOUR
PARENTS
DID
WHY
BECAUSE
THEIR
PARENTS
DID
ETC
DID
YOU
DO
ANYTHING
TO
GET
THEM
THE
THING
IS
I
KNOW
WHAT
ARMS
AND
LEGS
ARE
ITS
THEREFORE
GENERALLY
EASY
TO
TELL
WHETHER
OR
NOT
SOMEONE
HAS
ARMS
AND
LEGS
THIS
SINFUL
NATURE
SINCE
IT
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
THAT
THE
BABY
ACTUALLY
PERFORM
ANY
SINS
SEEMS
TO
BE
TOTALLY
INVISIBLE
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
MAYBE
HALF
THE
BABIES
HAVE
A
SINFUL
NATURE
AND
HALF
DONTITD
LOOK
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
TELL
THE
DIFFERENCE
WE
ARE
BORN
SINNERS
WE
ARE
BORN
SINNERS
BECAUSE
OUR
PARENTS
WERE
BORN
WITH
IT
WE
GOT
IT
FROM
THEM
WE
DID
NOTHING
TO
EARN
THE
TITLE
SINNER
WE
GET
IT
BECAUSE
OUR
PARENTS
HAD
IT
THEIR
PARENTS
HAD
IT
THEIR
GRANDPARENTS
HAD
IT
ETC
INFINITUM
SO
WHATS
SO
BAD
ABOUT
A
SINFUL
NATURE
THEN
I
COULD
UNDERSTAND
IT
BEING
BAD
IF
IT
ALWAYS
RESULTS
IN
PEOPLE
COMMITTING
SINS
BUT
BABIES
CAN
HAVE
IT
NEVER
COMMIT
SINS
DIE
AND
THEY
STILL
HAVE
IT
SO
THE
BAD
PART
ABOUT
CANT
MERELY
BE
THAT
IT
RESULTS
IN
PEOPLE
COMMITTING
SINSSO
WHAT
IS
BAD
ABOUT
IT
