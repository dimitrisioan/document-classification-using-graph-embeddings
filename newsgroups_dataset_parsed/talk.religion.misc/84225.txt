RE
IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED
IN
ARTICLE
ARROMDEEJYUSENKYOUCSJHUEDU
KEN
ARROMDEE
WRITES
YOU
SAID
EVERYONE
IN
THE
WORLD
THAT
MEANS
EVERYONE
IN
THE
WORLD
INCLUDING
CHILDREN
THAT
ARE
NOT
OLD
ENOUGH
TO
SPEAK
LET
ALONE
TELL
LIES
IF
JESUS
SAYS
EVERYONE
YOU
CANNOT
SUPPORT
THAT
BY
REFERRING
TO
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
SOMEWHAT
SMALLER
THAN
EVERYONE
THATS
RIGHT
EVERYONE
EVEN
INFANTS
WHO
CANNOT
SPEAK
AS
YET
EVEN
A
LITTLE
CHILD
WILL
REBELLIOUSLY
STICK
HIS
FINGER
IN
A
LIGHT
SOCKET
EVEN
A
LITTLE
CHILD
WILL
NOT
WANT
HIS
DIAPER
CHANGED
EVEN
A
LITTLE
CHILD
WILL
FIGHT
NAPTIME
SO
FAR
AS
JESUS
SAYING
EVERYONE
A
CERTAIN
RULER
ASKED
JESUS
GOOD
TEACHER
WHAT
MUST
I
DO
TO
INHERIT
ETERNAL
LIFE
WHY
DO
YOU
CALL
ME
GOOD
JESUS
ANSWERED
NO
ONE
IS
GOOD
EXCEPT
GOD
ALONE
KEN
THE
BOOK
OF
ROMANS
STATES
THAT
WE
ARE
BORN
SINNERS
WE
DO
NOT
GROW
INTO
BEING
A
SINNER
WE
SIN
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
SINNERS
THE
COMMON
MISTAKE
EVEN
IN
CHRISTIAN
CIRCLES
IS
TO
THINK
THE
REVERSE
TRUE
SO
FOR
AS
SURELY
AS
YOU
GREW
TO
LOOK
LIKE
YOU
PARENTS
YOU
NOT
ONLY
INHERITED
THEIR
APPEARANCE
BUT
ALSO
THEIR
SIN
NATURE
IT
GOES
WITH
BEING
HUMAN
EVEN
THOUGH
A
NEWBORN
IS
INNOCENT
AS
CAN
BE
HIS
SINFUL
NATURE
WILL
SURELY
MANIFEST
ITSELF
MORE
EXPLICITY
AS
HE
GETS
OLDER
FOR
AS
SURELY
AS
HE
GROWS
HAIR
ON
HIS
HEAD
AND
TEETH
WITHIN
HIS
MOUTH
HE
WILL
SHOW
THE
SIGNS
OF
HIS
INNATE
SIN
BY
REBELLING
AGAINST
MOMMY
AND
DADDY
WITH
THAT
LOUD
PROCLAMATION
NO
