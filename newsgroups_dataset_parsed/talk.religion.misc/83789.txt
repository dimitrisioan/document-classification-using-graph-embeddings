RE
HOMOSEXUALITY

WRITES
PERHAPS
YOU
DONT
GET
IT
AND
MAYBE
YOU
NEVER
WILL
MANY
DIDNT
GET
IT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AGES
AND
THE
PROCLAIMED
GODS
WILL
BE
DONE
AS
THEY
MASSACRED
THOUSANDS
IN
WITCH
HUNTS
AND
INQUISITIONS
THERE
WERE
MANY
INJUSTICES
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AGES
AND
THIS
IS
TRUELY
SAD
I
WOULD
HATE
TO
SEE
A
DAY
WHEN
CHURCHES
PUT
PEOPLE
TO
DEATH
OR
TORCHURED
THEM
FOR
PRACTICING
HOMOSEXUALITY
OR
ANY
OTHER
CRIME
THE
CHURCH
IS
NOT
CALLED
TO
TAKE
OVER
THE
GOVERNMENTS
OF
THE
WORLD
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
HOMOSEXUALS
TREATED
CRUELLY
TODAY
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
WE
SHOULD
TEACH
CHRISTIANS
TO
PRACTICE
HOMOSEXUAL
IMMORALITY
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
WE
SHOULD
ALSO
TEACH
CHRISTIANS
TO
PRACTICE
DIVINATION
AND
CHANNELLING
BECAUSE
THE
WITCHES
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AGES
WERE
PERSECUTED
THE
MAJOR
FLAW
IN
ALL
THIS
POSTURING
IS
THAT
IN
THE
END
THE
FINAL
EFFECT
OF
POSTS
LIKE
THAT
OF
YOURS
AND
MR
HUDSON
IS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
CONDITIONAL
LOVE
FOR
GAYS
CONDITION
CHANGE
AND
WELL
LOVE
YOU
THIS
IS
SURE
STRANGE
COMING
FROM
A
GROUP
WHO
CLAIM
THAT
GOD
HAS
AN
UNCONDITIONAL
LOVE
ONE
THAT
CALLS
PEOPLE
JUST
AS
THEY
ARE
AND
YOU
ACCUSE
ME
OF
JUDGING
WHEN
DID
YOU
LOOK
INTO
MY
HEART
AND
SEE
IF
I
HAVE
LOVE
I
HAVE
BEEN
WRITING
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
TEACH
CHRISTIANS
TO
PRACTICE
HOMOSEXUAL
IMMORALITY
AND
YOU
PRETEND
TO
HAVE
DIVINE
KNOWLEDGE
TO
LOOK
INTO
MY
HEART
I
CANT
SAY
THAT
I
LOVE
HOMOSEXUALS
AS
I
SHOULD
I
CANT
SAY
THAT
I
LOVE
MY
NEIGHBOR
AS
I
SHOULD
EITHER
I
DONT
KNOW
VERY
MANY
HOMOSEXUALS
AS
IT
IS
BUT
JESUS
LOVES
HOMOSEXUALS
JUST
AS
HE
LOVES
EVERYONE
ELSE
IF
HIS
LOVE
WERE
CONDITIONAL
I
NOT
KNOW
HIM
AT
ALL
YES
WE
SHOULD
SHOW
LOVE
TO
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
LOVE
TO
ENCOURAGE
BROTHERS
IN
THE
CHURCH
TO
STUMBLE
AND
CONTINUE
IN
THEIR
SIN
THAT
IS
A
VERY
DAMAGING
AND
DANGEROUS
THING
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
PASSING
AMENDMENT
IN
COLORADO
HAS
CREATED
AN
ORGANIZATION
WHOS
POSTERS
ARE
APPEARING
ALL
OVER
COLORADO
CALLED
STRAIGHT
I
FORGET
THE
WHOLE
DEFINITION
OFF
HAND
BUT
THE
LAST
PART
WAS
AGAINST
IMMORAL
GROSS
HOMOSEXUAL
TRASH
AND
THEIR
MOTTO
IS
WORKING
FOR
A
FAGFREE
AMERICA
WITH
AN
IMPLICIT
ADVOCATION
FOR
VIOLENCE
THIS
IS
SICK
AND
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
WHAT
YOU
AND
MR
HUDSON
AND
OTHERS
ARE
EMBRACING
THAT
IS
SLANDER
I
COULD
JUST
AS
EASILY
SAY
THAT
NAMBLA
HAS
BEEN
ABLE
TO
IMPLEMENT
LEGISLATION
TO
MAKE
CHILD
MOLESTING
EASIER
BECAUSE
OF
THE
TEARING
DOWN
OF
SOCIETIES
MORALITY
DUE
TO
PEOPLE
ACCEPTING
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
NORMAL
AND
THAT
THIS
IS
WHAT
YOU
ARE
EMBRACING
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
SEX
IS
IMMORAL
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
I
ENDORSE
USING
VIOLENCE
AGAINST
THEM
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
OF
HATRED
IN
THE
CHURCH
BUT
THERE
IS
ALSO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
CALLED
UNSANCTIFIED
MERCY
MANY
IN
THE
CONSERVATIVE
CHURCHES
HAVE
SEEN
THE
MORAL
BREAKDOWN
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
THE
STORM
ON
THE
HORIZON
AND
HAVE
GOTTEN
MILITANT
IN
THE
FLESH
THIS
IS
TRUELY
SAD
YET
OTHERS
IN
OTHER
CHURCHES
HAVE
EMBRACED
IMMORALITY
IN
SOCIETY
AND
HAVE
POINTED
TO
THE
CARNALITY
IN
THE
CONSERVATIVE
CHURCHES
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
ACTIONS
WHY
DONT
WE
JUST
STICK
TO
THE
POSITIVE
AND
FIND
WAYS
TO
BRING
PEOPLE
TO
JESUS
ISTEAD
OF
TAKING
BULLWHIPS
AND
DRIVING
THEM
AWAY
CERTAINLY
WE
SHOULD
NOT
USE
A
BULLWHIP
TO
DRIVE
PEOPLE
FROM
JESUS
BUT
WE
SHOULDNT
WATER
DOWN
THE
GOSPEL
TO
DRAW
PEOPLE
IN
JESUS
DIDNT
GO
OUT
OF
HIS
WAY
TO
SHOW
ONLY
WHAT
MIGHT
BE
CONSIDERED
POSITIVE
ASPECTS
TO
DRAW
PEOPLE
IN
HE
TOLD
ONE
MAN
TO
SELL
ALL
HE
HAD
HE
TOLD
ANOTHER
NOT
TO
SAY
GOOD
BYE
TO
HIS
FAMILY
HIS
WORDS
WERE
HARD
AT
TIMES
WE
SHOULD
PRESENT
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
COST
OF
THE
TOWER
BEFORE
WE
ALLOW
THEM
TO
BEGIN
CONSTRUCTION
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
INNOCULATED
TO
THE
GOSPEL
LINK
