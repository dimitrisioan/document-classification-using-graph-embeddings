just
three
really
competing
rosicrucian
orders
i
have
probably
spent
more
time
than
you
doing
the
same
none
of
them
are
spinoffs
from
oto
the
opposite
may
be
the
case
can
we
assume
from
this
statement
that
you
are
unequivocally
saying
that
amorc
is
not
a
spin
off
of
oto
and
that
in
fact
oto
may
well
be
a
spin
off
of
amorc
i
would
be
quite
interested
in
hearing
what
evidence
you
have
to
support
this
claim
well
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
evidence
floating
around
that
indicates
that
oto
has
been
around
since
at
least
the
late
long
before
crowley
ever
heard
of
it
how
long
has
amorc
been
around
yes
i
know
that
they
claim
to
have
existed
as
an
organization
clear
into
prehistory
but
i
doubt
that
they
have
any
organizational
paperwork
as
a
nonprofit
that
can
be
carbondated
