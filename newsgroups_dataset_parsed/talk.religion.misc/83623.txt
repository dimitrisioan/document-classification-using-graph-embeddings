THE

IS
THIS
CHRISTIAN
A
SAYS
BEHAVIOR
SUCHANDSUCH
IS
SINFUL
WHAT
IS
CHRISTIAN
B
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
WITH
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
ONE
POSSIBILITY
ALWAYS
EXISTS

MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
PERSUADE
B
THAT
THE
BEHAVIOR
IN
QUESTION
DOES
EXHIBIT
A
FAILURE
IN
LOVING
GOD
OR
NEIGHBOR
MICHAEL
MODERN
LIBERAL
THAT
HE
IS
READS
A
FAIRLY
BENIGN
MEANING
INTO
THIS
WORD
HE
THEN
CONSTRUCTS
HIS
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
AROUND
THIS
UNDERSTANDING
READING
OTHER
SCRIPTURE
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THESE
COMMANDMENTS
WITH
LOVE
BENIGNLY
UNDERSTOOD
I
REGARD
LOVE
AS
NO
MORE
OR
LESS
BENIGN
THAN
ANY
OTHER
CHRISTIAN
DOES
YOU
ARE
MERELY
EXPRESSING
APPROVAL
OF
THE
CONSEQUENCES
I
FIND
THEREIN
WHICH
SAYS
MORE
ABOUT
OUR
POLITICS
AND
CULTURAL
TRAPPINGS
THAN
ABOUT
MY
OR
ANY
RELIGION
LOVE
IS
A
HIGHLY
AMBIGUOUS
WORD
OF
WHICH
CHRISTIANS
CAN
WRITE
BOTH
THE
GENTLE
WORDS
PAUL
USES
OF
IT
IN
CORINTHIANS
IN
A
PASSAGE
THAT
EVEN
THE
CONSERVATIVES
WILL
QUOTE
AT
YOU
AND
THE
WORDS
OF
T
S
ELIOT
IN
HIS
PENTACOST
HYMN
LOVE
IS
THE
UNFAMILIAR
NAME
THAT
WOVE
THE
INTOLERABLE
SHIRT
OF
FLAME
THIS
IS
IN
ANY
CASE
RATHER
TO
THE
SIDE
OF
WHAT
I
WAS
ATTEMPTING
TO
RAISE
IN
MY
NOTE
AS
WILL
BECOME
MORE
EVIDENT
BELOW
AS
A
NONBELIEVER
I
FIND
MICHAELS
CHRISTIANITY
KINDER
AND
GENTLER
BLECHHH
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
MISREADING
ME
RATHER
SERIOUSLY
THOUGH
GIVEN
MY
PRINCIPLE
THAT
ONE
CANNOT
FORCE
ONES
OWN
NOTION
OF
SIN
ON
ANOTHER
AND
MY
UNSHAKEABLE
DISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM
RUSSEL
TURPIN
AND
OTHERS
BELIEVERS
AND
UNBELIEVERS
ALIKE
ARE
UNDER
NO
THREAT
OF
MY
LEGISLATING
MY
OWN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
CHRISTIAN
LOVE
IF
I
TAKE
HIM
AT
HIS
WORD
HE
CANNOT
CONDEMN
THE
INQUISITORS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
ALSO
FOLLOWING
THESE
COMMANDMENTS
AS
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
THEM
IF
YOU
MISREAD
I
CAN
DO
AND
HAVE
REPEATEDLY
DONE
A
COMPLETE
BILL
OF
ACCUSATION
AGAINST
THE
INQUISITION
BY
EXHIBITING
IN
AS
THOROUGH
A
FORM
AS
ANYONE
MIGHT
WANT
A
DEMONSTRATION
OF
THE
HARM
IT
HAS
DONE
TO
HUMAN
BEINGS
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
TO
RESPECT
FOR
LET
ALONE
LOVE
OF
GOD
IN
NEAR
SUCCESSION
PLEASE
GO
BACK
TO
MY
QUOTED
WORDS
ABOVE
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
ALWAYS
EXISTS
IS
THAT
I
OR
TO
REVERT
TO
PROPER
TIME
SEQUENCE
MY
PREDECESSORS
OVER
THE
LAST
SEVERAL
CENTURIES
COULD
PERSUADE
CHRISTIAN
B
OF
MY
CASE
THAT
THE
INQUISITION
DOES
INDEED
CONSTITUTE
AN
EGREGIOUS
VIOLATION
OF
THE
LAW
OF
LOVE
I
MUST
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
BEEN
SO
PERSUADED
BY
CHRISTIAN
ARGUMENTATION
AS
WELL
AS
BY
SECULAR
BOTH
CHRISTIAN
AND
NONCHRISTIAN
PROHIBITIONS
WHAT
MR
TURPIN
ALLUDES
TO
IS
A
TRICKIER
POINT
A
I
DEMONSTRATE
THE
HUMAN
PAIN
AND
VIOLATION
OF
LOVE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
INQUISITION
B
THE
INQUISITOR
RESPONDS
THAT
MOTHER
CHURCH
MUST
HOWEVER
PAINFUL
THIS
SEEMS
DISCIPLINE
HER
CHILDREN
FOR
THEIR
OWN
GOOD
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
SALVATION
OF
THEIR
SOULS
OR
IF
THE
TORTURED
HERETIC
WILL
NOT
RECANT
THAN
BY
BAD
EXAMPLE
DETERRING
OTHERS
FROM
THE
SAME
LOSSOFSOUL
A
I
POINT
OUT
THAT
THIS
JUSTIFICATION
OF
A
FAILURE
IN
LOVE
DEPENDS
ON
A
HIGHLY
SPECULATIVE
CONSTRUAL
OF
TEXTS
AND
OF
PHILOSOPHICAL
ASSERTIONS
THAT
ARE
QUITE
UNDEMONSTRABLE
B
BURNS
ME
AT
THE
STAKE
MY
RHETORIC
HAS
FAILED
BUT
THE
POINT
I
AM
MAKING
IS
SUSTAINED
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
HERE
HAS
A
LOT
TO
DO
WITH
CULTURAL
BAGGAGE
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
BAGGAGE
INCLUDES
A
NEARLY
UNIVERSAL
AND
ABSOLUTELY
SECULAR
BELIEF
THAT
AN
ACCUSED
PERSON
MUST
PROVE
INNOCENCE
AND
THAT
TESTIMONY
IS
MOST
BELIEVABLE
IF
TAKEN
UNDER
TORTURE
THE
ELIMINATION
OF
INQISITORIAL
PRACTICE
IN
THOSE
PLACES
WHERE
IT
HAS
BEEN
ELIMINATED
OR
AT
LEAST
GREATLY
REDUCED
HAS
VERY
LITTLE
IF
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
SIN
IN
THE
EXCHANGE
BETWEEN
A
AND
B
MR
TURPIN
IS
POINTING
OUT
THAT
IF
I
AM
A
VERSUS
THE
GRAND
INQUISITORS
B
THEN
MY
PERSUASION
IS
NOT
VERY
LIKELY
TO
WORK
I
KNOW
THIS
AND
IN
WHAT
EVER
PERSONAL
AGONY
I
CONSIGN
THE
ISSUE
TO
GOD
AND
MY
GHOSTLY
DEFENSE
ATTORNEY
SO
ONE
POSSIBILITY
FAILS
IN
THIS
CASE
AS
IT
WILL
FAIL
IN
MAY
OTHERS
AT
THE
OTHER
EXTREME
THE
PERSUASION
WILL
SUCCEED
WHEN
IT
PROPERLY
SHOULD
NOT
IF
IT
ENTAILS
MISTAKEN
ASSUMPTIONS
I
SHARE
WITH
THE
INQUISITOR
AND
THAT
IS
POTENTIALLY
AN
EVEN
MORE
TROUBLING
CASE
IN
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
VICTIMS
OF
INQUISITION
WILL
HAVE
ACCEPTED
THAT
THEY
WERE
IN
FACT
SINFUL
IN
SUCH
RANDOM
CASES
AS
THEY
MAY
ACTUALLY
HAVE
BEEN
GUILTY
OF
CHARGES
BROUGHT
AGAINST
THEM
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THE
PERSUASION
BREAKS
DOWN
WHEN
THE
PARTIES
DO
NOT
SHARE
ENOUGH
TO
AGREE
ON
ALL
THE
CULTURAL
BAGGAGE
AND
GIVEN
THE
MAIN
THRUST
OF
THE
INQUISITION
AGAINST
HERESY
IT
IS
BOUND
TO
BREAK
DOWN
IN
PRECISELY
THE
WORST
CASES
THE
CONSERVATIVE
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
IS
THE
RIGHT
WORD
BTW
WILL
TAKE
REFUGE
IN
WHAT
I
ATTRIBUTE
TO
B
ABOVE
THAT
HE
IS
JUSTIFIED
IN
CAUSING
HARM
BECAUSE
HE
THINKS
THAT
WORKS
TO
A
GREATER
GOOD
BUT
THIS
IS
A
VIOLENT
AND
EXTRAVAGANT
REFUSAL
TO
FOLLOW
THE
GOSPEL
AS
IF
ONES
THEORIES
ABOUT
SIN
ENTITLED
ONE
TO
CAST
ASIDE
JESUS
WORDS
ON
DEALING
WITH
SINNERS
CF
MATTHEW
I
AM
A
RADICAL
CHRISTIAN
ONLY
IN
THAT
I
TAKE
THE
GOSPEL
SERIOUSLY
OR
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WHAT
DOES
IT
MEAN
TO
LOVE
ONES
FELLOW
MAN
AND
WHAT
IS
THE
RIGHT
THING
AND
HOW
DOES
ONE
GO
ABOUT
LOVING
GOD
WELL
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
MAKING
THESE
THE
BASE
COMMANDMENTS
IS
THAT
THEY
ARENT
REDUCIBLE
TO
RULES
A
SET
OF
RULES
IS
A
MORAL
CODE
OR
A
LAW
CODE
OR
AN
ALGORITHM
FOR
ACTING
SUCH
THINGS
CAN
BE
VERY
HELPFUL
TO
INDIVIDUALS
OR
SOCIETIES
BUT
NOT
IF
THEY
ARE
USED
INSTEAD
OF
A
PERSONAL
INVOLVEMENT
IN
AND
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
ONES
ACTIONS
THE
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
IS
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
A
CALL
TO
ACT
AS
IF
YOU
WERE
GOD
AND
ACCEPTING
ULTIMATE
RESPONSIBILITY
IN
YOUR
EVERY
ACTION
A
DEMAND
THAT
I
LIKE
MOST
WOULD
RATHER
NOT
HEAR
BUT
IT
KEEPS
POPPING
UP
NONETHELESS
ALONG
WITH
THE
REASSURANCE
THAT
IT
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAT
I
BE
OPEN
TO
TRYING
THIS
THAN
SUCCEEDING
AT
IT
CONSERVATIVES
MAY
TWIST
THIS
ACT
AS
IF
YOU
WERE
GOD
TO
MEAN
LAY
DOWN
RULES
FOR
OTHER
PEOPLE
AND
BE
AS
NASTY
TO
THEM
AS
POSSIBLE
IF
THEY
DONT
KEEP
YOUR
RULES
THEY
ARE
SO
INSISTENT
AND
OBVIOUS
ABOUT
THIS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
CONVINCED
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
RIGHTLY
REJECT
THE
WHOLE
CONCEPT
THAT
SUCH
IDIOCY
IS
HOW
GOD
ACTS
THAT
AFTER
ALL
IS
THE
STANDARD
ACCUSATION
AGAINST
GOD
BY
THE
ATHEISTS
HERE
AND
ELSEWHERE
THAT
THE
CONSERVATIVES
HAVE
CONFUSED
THEIR
MANIPULATIVE
HOOPJUMPING
NOTIONS
OF
COERCING
OTHER
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
NATURE
OF
GOD
IS
ALMOST
THE
ENTIRE
CONTENT
OF
STANDARD
AMERICAN
ATHEISM
AND
I
QUITE
AGREE
WITH
IT
ON
THIS
POINT
ETHICAL
SYSTEMS
ARE
NOT
DIFFERENTIATED
BY
THE
NICE
SOUNDING
GOO
UP
FRONT
MUCH
OF
WHICH
SOUNDS
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
BUT
BY
THE
SPECIFIC
ACTS
PROCEDURES
AND
ARGUMENTS
THAT
THEY
RECOMMEND
AND
DIFFERENT
BODIES
OF
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
URGED
DIFFERENT
ETHICAL
SYSTEMS
OR
IN
SOME
CASES
NONE
AS
A
RESULT
IT
IS
BIZARRE
TO
IDENTIFY
ANY
ONE
OF
THESE
SYSTEMS
HOWEVER
POPULAR
OR
INFAMOUS
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
CHRISTIANITY
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
TORAH
IT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
QURAN
SPECIFICALLY
CHRISTIAN
SCRIPTURE
HAS
VERY
LITTLE
IF
ANYTHING
IN
THE
WAY
OF
COMMANDMENTS
SO
LITTLE
THAT
THE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
DESPERATELY
WANT
COMMANDMENTS
GO
MINING
FOR
THEM
WITH
ALMOST
NO
SUPPORT
AND
THUS
ALMOST
NO
OBVIOUS
LIMITATION
FOR
THEIR
EFFORTS
THE
ONE
SINGLE
THING
IN
THE
GOSPELS
WHICH
JESUS
SPECIFICALLY
GIVES
AS
A
COMMANDMENT
TO
US
IS
LOVE
ONE
ANOTHER
I
WILL
BE
EXPANDING
ON
THIS
POINT
IN
A
REPLY
TO
PAUL
HUDSON
THAT
I
HOPE
TO
GET
TO
IN
A
DAY
OR
SO
IT
IS
QUITE
TRUE
THAT
SOME
CHRISTIANS
INFER
LOTS
OF
COMMANDMENTS
FROM
THE
NT
ILL
POINT
OUT
WHAT
HAS
TO
BE
GOING
ON
IN
THESE
INFERENCES
AND
WHY
THERE
IS
A
HUGE
AMOUNT
OF
CULTURAL
BAGGAGE
INVOLVED
YOU
ARE
QUITE
RIGHT
THAT
THIS
IS
GOO
IF
ONE
IS
LOOKING
FOR
AN
ETHICAL
SYSTEM
BUT
WHY
SHOULD
ANYONE
BE
LOOKING
FOR
AN
ETHICAL
SYSTEM
SINCE
OUR
SOCIETY
IS
EAGER
TO
HAND
US
ONE
OR
MORE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
WE
DO
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
WE
NEED
A
PRINCIPLE
FOR
THE
CRITIQUE
OF
ETHICAL
SYSTEMS
IN
WHICH
CASE
I
WILL
PROFER
THE
AGAPATE
ALLELOU
ONCE
AGAIN
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
A
FEW
CHRISTIANS
SUCH
AS
MICHAEL
FIND
A
BENIGN
MEANING
FOR
THE
GOO
AND
THEN
INTERPRET
THE
USUALLY
UGLY
SPECIFICS
IN
A
MORE
CONSTRUCTIVE
FASHION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
DO
THINK
THAT
THIS
TELLS
US
MORE
ABOUT
MICHAEL
AND
CHRISTIANS
LIKE
HIM
THAT
IT
TELLS
US
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
BEGGING
THE
QUESTION
WHY
DONT
I
AND
THE
MYRIADS
OF
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
LIKE
ME
TELL
YOU
SOMETHING
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
NOR
IS
THIS
VERY
NEW
IN
CHRISTIANITY
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
LOOK
UP
THE
ORIGINS
AND
FUNDAMENTAL
DOCTRINES
OF
THE
QUAKERS
FROM
THE
CENTURY
ONWARDS
AND
THEY
ARE
NOT
AT
ALL
THE
FIRST
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
GOSPEL
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
IS
CONGENIAL
TO
MY
CASE
MICHAEL

SIEMON
I
SAY
YOU
ARE
