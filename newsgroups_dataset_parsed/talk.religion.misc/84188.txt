re
food
for
thought
on
tyre
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
tyre
in
sum
ezekiel
prophesied
that
the
place
would
be
mashed
and
never
rebuilt
as
there
are
a
lot
of
people
living
there
it
would
appear
that
ezekiel
was
not
literally
correct
this
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
because
i
understand
the
language
ezekiel
used
differently
than
do
socalled
biblical
literalists
for
example
it
sometimes
happens
that
someone
says
my
grandson
is
the
cutest
baby
and
then
turns
around
and
sees
the
granddaughter
and
says
oh
isnt
she
the
cutest
thing
this
person
is
not
literally
claiming
to
have
lined
up
all
the
babies
in
the
world
according
to
cuteness
and
discovered
his
own
grandchildren
tied
for
first
rather
he
is
trying
to
express
his
emotions
using
words
that
are
very
objectoriented
because
this
example
is
one
that
is
common
to
many
people
nobody
misunderstands
the
intent
of
the
statements
the
bible
however
is
often
at
the
mercy
of
people
who
assume
that
everything
within
must
be
exactly
literally
true
for
those
people
the
existence
of
tyre
is
a
problem
for
me
it
is
not
turning
to
the
latest
person
trying
to
defend
ezekiel
we
read
this
from
john
e
king
the
prophesy
clearly
implies
that
people
would
still
be
living
in
the
area
no
it
implies
nothing
of
the
kind
if
you
had
nothing
but
the
prophecy
from
ezekiel
and
you
were
told
you
interpret
it
literally
you
would
never
say
oh
he
means
that
there
will
be
houses
and
businesses
and
plants
and
stuff
like
that
you
would
read
i
will
make
you
a
bare
rock
and
you
will
never
be
rebuilt
and
youd
conclude
that
tyre
would
be
a
bare
rock
the
only
way
to
get
from
fishing
nets
to
houses
and
buildings
and
a
mediumlarge
population
is
if
you
know
that
all
that
latter
stuff
is
there
in
other
words
your
answer
means
that
ezekiel
misled
everybody
who
read
the
prophecy
at
the
time
it
was
written
there
is
no
way
that
given
a
literal
reading
they
could
read
this
passage
and
conclude
mediumsize
city
you
seem
to
feel
that
never
be
rebuilt
means
be
rebuilt
maybe
so
but
it
is
hardly
a
clear
implication
mr
king
also
writes
so
far
ive
seen
stated
figurers
ranging
from
to
lets
assume
the
latter
one
is
correct
by
modern
standards
we
are
talking
about
a
onehorse
town
well
no
thats
only
a
bit
less
than
the
population
of
annapolis
where
im
from
you
know
the
naval
acadamy
the
state
capital
george
washington
resigned
his
commission
in
the
statehouse
annapolis
may
not
be
new
york
but
its
at
least
a
twohorse
town
but
supposing
people
is
a
small
town
its
still
people
more
than
ezekiel
predicted
and
youve
said
nothing
about
the
other
problem
in
chapter
ezekiel
predicts
that
nebuchadnezzar
will
will
destroy
tyre
and
loot
all
their
valuables
however
nebuchadnezzar
did
not
destroy
tyre
and
in
chapter
ezekiel
even
quotes
god
as
saying
he
and
his
army
got
no
reward
from
the
campaign
he
led
against
tyre
lets
ignore
alexander
for
a
moment
and
just
pay
attention
to
chapter
ezekiel
says
n
would
destroy
tyre
and
n
did
not
destroy
tyre
ezekiel
says
that
n
would
plunder
their
valuables
but
n
did
not
plunder
their
valuables
regardless
of
what
you
think
about
tyre
now
the
fact
is
that
n
died
before
the
place
was
destroyed
ezekiel
said
n
was
going
to
do
it
and
n
did
not
this
post
is
of
course
pointless
inerrantists
have
an
amazing
ability
to
rewrite
the
bible
as
needed
to
fit
whatever
they
want
it
to
say
for
example
i
expect
mr
king
to
respond
to
the
comments
about
ezekiel
by
pulling
some
clear
implications
out
of
hat
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
towers
that
clearly
implied
that
the
walls
would
still
be
standing
so
people
would
know
where
the
towers
used
to
be
and
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
fine
houses
and
throw
your
stones
timber
and
rubble
into
the
sea
that
clearly
implied
that
n
would
never
set
foot
on
the
island
and
when
ezekiel
wrote
that
n
would
build
a
ramp
up
to
your
walls
that
clearly
implies
that
n
would
spend
years
stomping
around
on
the
mainland
and
never
get
close
to
the
walls
see
a
few
clear
implications
that
are
totally
contrary
to
the
text
and
you
can
reconcile
anything
you
want
