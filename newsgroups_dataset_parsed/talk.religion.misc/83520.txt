rosicrucian
orders
on
the
subject
of
how
many
competing
rc
orders
there
are
let
me
point
out
the
golden
dawn
is
only
the
outer
order
of
that
tradition
the
inner
order
is
the
roseae
rubeae
et
aurae
crucis
thats
ruby
rose
and
gold
cross
in
rough
translation
the
gd
is
a
rosicrucian
order
as
are
all
derivative
groups
of
course
real
rosicrucians
never
admit
to
being
rosicrucian
enjoy
the
journey
branarthur
