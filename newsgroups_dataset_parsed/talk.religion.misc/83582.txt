A
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
MUST
HAVE
MISSED
WHEN
YOU
SAID
THIS
ABOUT
THESE
OTHER
PROMISES
OF
GOD
THAT
WE
KEEP
GETTING
SUBJECTED
TO
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
WHY
I
AM
WRONG
AND
THEY
ARE
OK
OR
AN
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
OF
PUBLIC
HYPOCRISY
BOTH
OR
NEITHER
SO
ACCORDING
TO
YOU
JIM
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
CRITICIZE
ONE
PERSON
FOR
TAKING
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
WITHOUT
BEING
A
HYPOCRITE
IS
TO
POST
A
RESPONSE
TO
EVERY
PERSON
ON
TRM
WHO
TAKES
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
DID
I
EITHER
ASK
OR
ASSERT
THAT
OR
IS
THIS
YOUR
MISAIMED
TELEPATHY
AT
WORK
AGAIN
STEPHEN
SAID
YOU
TOOK
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
YOU
NOTED
THAT
STEPHEN
HAD
NOT
REPLIED
TO
SOME
OTHER
TRM
ARTICLE
CALL
IT
A
THAT
TOOK
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
BUT
THE
LACK
OF
EVIDENCE
FOR
X
DOES
NOT
CONSTITUTE
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
LACK
OF
X
A
COMMON
CREATIONIST
ERROR
SO
THE
FACT
THAT
STEPHEN
DID
NOT
REPLY
TO
A
DOES
NOT
JUSTIFY
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
STEPHEN
CONDONED
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
IN
A
EXCELLENT
NOW
UNDER
WHAT
CONDITIONS
COULD
SUCH
A
CONCLUSION
BE
MADE
OTHER
THAN
A
DIRECT
ASSERTION
BY
HIS
PART
FOR
INSTANCE
AM
I
TO
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
HAVE
NO
POSITION
ON
EATING
SHIT
MERELY
BECAUSE
YOU
HAVE
NOT
SAID
YOUR
POSITION
OR
MIGHT
A
CONCLUSION
BE
MADE
BY
OBSERVING
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
I
ASSUMED
YOU
WERE
BEING
LOGICAL
AND
THAT
THE
SENTENCE
THAT
BEGINS
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
WAS
NOT
A
NONSEQUITUR
BUT
WAS
INTENDED
TO
FOLLOW
FROM
THE
SENTENCE
THAT
PRECEDED
IT
IS
THAT
BETTER
JIM
ITS
CALLED
AN
ARGUMENT
IF
YOU
DISAGREE
WITH
IT
EXPLAIN
WHY
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
NOT
SOUND
I
ADMIT
THAT
MY
ASSUMPTION
IN
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
A
BIT
HASTY
IF
YOU
AGREE
WITH
IT
JUST
SAY
YUP
HAVE
YOU
BY
CHANCE
EVER
EVEN
HEARD
OF
INDUCTIVE
LOGIC
YOU
ARE
NOT
DEMONSTRATING
ANY
FAMILIARLY
WITH
IT
IE
YOU
ARE
BEING
INSUFFICIENTLY
LOGICAL
