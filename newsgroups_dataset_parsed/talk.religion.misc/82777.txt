A

FROM

BRASS
URN
IN
A
TEMPLE
ONE
OF
ONLY
FOUR
IN

DEDICATED
TO
ONE
OF
THE
WORLDS
MOST
ANCIENT
RELIGIONS
WITH
THE
FLAMES
GO
THE
PRAYERS
OF
ABOUT
BAY
AREA
ZOROASTRIANS
THAT
THEIR
FAITH
WILL
SURVIVE
THIS
LAND
THERE
IS
A
FEAR
A
REAL
FEAR
TOO
SAID
SILLOO
TARAPORE
OF
LAFAYETTE
WE
HAVE
ONE
GENERATION
TO
DO
IT
OR
TO
DIE
MANY
IMMIGRANT
GROUPS
STRUGGLE
TO
MAINTAIN
AN
IDENTITY
IN
A
STRANGE
LAND
BUT
FOR
ZOROASTRIANS
IT
IS
AN
ESPECIALLY
POIGNANT
CONCERN
THEIR
RELIGION
HAS
BEEN
AROUND
FOR
PERHAPS
YEARS
A
HERITAGE
SO
DEEP
IT
SCARCELY
SEEMS
COMPREHENSIBLE
IN
A
STATE
WHERE
HISTORICAL
SITES
ARE
SOMETIMES
LESS
THAN
YEARS
OLD
IT
WAS
THE
RELIGION
OF
THE
GREAT
PERSIAN
EMPIRE
UNDER
KINGS
CYRUS
AND
DARIUS
AND
TRADITION
SAYS
THAT
WHEN
CHRIST
WAS
BORN
ABOUT
YEARS
LATER
HE
WAS
HONORED
BY
A
VISIT
FROM
THREE
ZOROASTRIAN
PRIESTS
THE
MAGI
SCHOLARS
SAY
MANY
KEY
BELIEFS
OF
CHRISTIANS
JEWS
AND
MUSLIMS
CAN
BE
TRACED
TO
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
ZOROASTER
THE
ZOROASTRIAN
PROPHET
YET
WITH
ONLY
ABOUT
ZOROASTRIANS
IN
THE
ENTIRE
WORLD
THEY
ARE
A
MINISCULE
MINORITY
IN
EVERY
COUNTRY
IN
WHICH
THEY
LIVE
SURVIVAL
AS
A
PEOPLE
IS
VERY
MUCH
ON
THEIR
MINDS
IRONICALLY
LOCAL
ZOROASTRIANS
FEAR
THAT
THE
ALMOST
UNLIMITED
TOLERANCE
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
MAY
DO
WHAT
HUNDREDS
OF
YEARS
OF
PERSECUTION
FOLLOWED
BY
NEARLY
YEARS
OF
BENIGN
RELIGIOUS
SEGREGATION
COULD
NOT
DO
CAUSE
THEIR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
TO
STOP
THINKING
OF
THEMSELVES
AS
ZOROASTRIANS
ZOROASTRIANS
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THEIRS
IS
THE
ONLY
RIGHT
RELIGION
AND
THEY
ACTUALLY
SHUN
THE
NOTION
OF
TRYING
TO
WIN
CONVERTS
SO
IF
THEIR
CHILDREN
BECOME
TOTALLY
ASSIMILATED
THEY
SAY
ITS
THEIR
CHILDREN
RATHER
THAN
THE
WORLD
AT
LARGE
WHO
WILL
BE
THE
LOSERS
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
HAVE
AN
IDENTITY
SAID
MANECK
BHUJWAIA
OF
SAN
JOSE
A
LEADER
AMONG
ZOROASTRIANS
WHO
CAME
HERE
FROM
INDIA
ITS
IMPORTANT
FOR
EVERYBODY
IRISH
SCOTTISH
AMERICANS
IT
GIVES
MEANING
TO
LIFE
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
DEPEND
ON
THE
MAJORITY
COMMUNITY
TO
GIVE
YOU
RESPECT
YOU
CAN
FALL
BACK
ON
YOUR
OWN
IDENTITY
FOR
ZOROASTRIANS
THERES
MUCH
TO
BE
PROUD
OF
THEIR
PROPHET
ZOROASTER
SEEKING
TO
MAKE
SENSE
OF
A
CULTURE
IN
WHICH
ANIMAL
SACRIFICE
TO
MULTIPLE
GODS
WAS
COMMON
PREACHED
THAT
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
GOD
A
GOOD
ONE
ZOROASTRIANS
CALL
THEIR
GOD
AHURA
MAZDA
WHICH
TRANSLATES
AS
LORD
OF
WISDOM
AND
LIGHT
GOOD
VS
EVIL
ZOROASTER
SAW
LIFE
AS
A
CONSTANT
STRUGGLE
BETWEEN
GOOD
AND
EVIL
WITH
THE
GOOD
EVENTUALLY
WINNING
MEN
AND
WOMEN
COULD
JOIN
IN
THE
BATTLE
FOR
GOOD
HE
SAID
AND
HE
WARNED
THAT
THEY
WOULD
INEVITABLY
SUFFER
CONSEQUENCES
SUCH
AS
SHAME
AND
SORROW
IF
THEY
DID
WRONG
HE
PREACHED
HONESTY
CHARITY
KINDNESS
TO
ANIMALS
RESPECT
FOR
THE
ENVIRONMENT
HARD
WORK
EQUALITY
OF
MEN
AND
WOMEN
BASIC
VIRTUES
PREACHED
BY
PROPHETS
OF
MANY
RELIGIONS
BUT
ZOROASTER
WAS
PERHAPS
UNUSUAL
IN
THAT
HE
TOLD
HIS
FOLLOWERS
NOT
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
BLINDLY
HE
DEMANDED
THEY
THINK
FOR
THEMSELVES
IN
FACT
JOSEPH
CAMPBELL
THE
FAMOUS
SCHOLAR
OF
THE
HISTORY
AND
MEANING
OF
MYTHS
TRACED
THE
WESTERN
EMPHASIS
ON
INDIVIDUAL
THOUGHT
TO
THE
ZOROASTRIANS
ZOROASTRIANS
HAVE
MANY
WORDS
FOR
THOUGHT
THEIR
MOTTO
LEADED
INTO
A
STAINED
GLASS

OVER
THE
SACRED
FIRE
AT
THE
TEMPLE
ON
THE

SO
ITS
NOT
SURPRISING
THAT
ZOROASTRIANS
VALUE
EDUCATION
HIGHLY
IN
INDIA

A
CONTINGENT
