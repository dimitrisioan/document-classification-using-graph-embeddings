now
that
big
brother
has
rubbed
out
one
minority
religion
in
waco
who
is
next
the
mormons
or
jews
give
me
a
break
if
the
mormons
fortified
utah
and
armed
it
to
the
teeth
and
were
involved
in
illegal
activity
then
they
deserve
whatever
they
get
where
were
you
brought
up
in
the
former
ussr
is
innocent
until
proven
guilty
by
a
jury
of
your
peers
not
dan
rather
dead
in
this
country
seems
so
is
tax
evasion
the
only
charge
brought
against
the
bds
punishable
by
death
in
this
country
now
you
are
making
a
ludicrous
suggestion
not
really
you
are
a
blind
idiot
we
used
to
live
in
a
country
where
everyone
enjoyed
the
free
exercise
of
their
rights
to
worship
and
bear
arms
now
we
dont
does
that
include
the
right
to
murder
little
children
how
about
killing
atf
officers
i
do
not
know
much
about
the
gun
laws
in
texas
but
koreshs
folks
claimed
to
have
grenades
grenade
launchers
and
rocket
launchers
i
am
not
sure
that
the
nra
feels
that
this
falls
under
right
to
bear
arms
not
sure
yet
you
condem
them
to
death
for
it
if
the
batf
had
stayed
home
all
would
be
alive
now
so
who
murdered
who
of
course
to
jews
and
mormons
this
is
just
a
broken
record
it
has
happened
before
please
explain
i
do
not
remember
jews
or
mormons
as
a
group
overtly
breaking
a
judicious
aka
nonnazi
law
and
being
punished
for
it
you
have
a
short
memory
ill
bet
all
you
cult
haters
are
happy
now
right
just
hope
youre
