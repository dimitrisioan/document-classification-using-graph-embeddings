RE
AFTER
YEARS
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY
IS
IN
ARTICLE
LEFTYAPPLECOM
LEFTY
WRITES
THESE
PARTICULAR
TIBETANS
ARE
ADVOCATING
INCREASED
VIOLENCE
AGAINST
THE
CHINESE
OCCUPIERS
ARE
THEY
WRONG
WRONG
ABOUT
WHAT
I
THINK
THEY
ARE
CORRECT
IN
THINKING
THAT
A
WELLPLACED
BOMB
OR
SIX
WOULD
GET
HEADLINES
BUT
I
THINK
THEY
ARE
WRONG
IF
THEY
THINK
THAT
YOU
CAN
SET
OFF
BOMBS
AND
STILL
BE
A
BUDDHIST
MAYBE
WHAT
WE
ARE
SEEING
HERE
IS
THAT
CHINESE
CULTURAL
GENOCIDE
AGAINST
THE
TIBETANS
HAS
WORKED
WELL
ENOUGH
THAT
SOME
TIBETANS
ARE
NOW
NO
LONGER
BUDDHIST
AND
ARE
INSTEAD
WILLING
TO
BEHAVE
LIKE
THE
CHINESE
OCCUPIERS
EVERY
ACTION
IS
ITS
OWN
REWARD
CLEARLY
THE
OCCUPATION
OF
TIBET
HAS
BEEN
LARGELY
IGNORED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
AWARE
OF
THE
OCCUPATION
ARE
MOSTLY
FULL
OF
ADMIRATION
FOR
THE
PEACEFUL
WAY
THAT
TIBETANS
HAVE
PUT
UP
WITH
IT
AND
WHAT
DOES
IT
COST
US
TO
ADMIRE
THEM
ZIP
ARE
TIBETANS
CURRENTLY
PEOPLE
OF
PEACE
DO
THEY
SERVE
THEMSELVES
WELL
OR
BADLY
BY
BEING
SO
YES
THEY
ARE
AND
WHETHER
THIS
SERVES
THEM
WELL
OR
NOT
DEPENDS
ON
WHETHER
THEY
WANT
BUDDHIST
PRINCIPLES
OR
POLITICAL
INDEPENDENCE
AND
WITHOUT
POLITICAL
INDEPENDENCE
CAN
THEY
PRESERVE
THEIR
CULTURAL
AND
RELIGIOUS
TRADITIONS
WOULD
AN
INCREASED
LEVEL
OF
VIOLENCE
MAKE
THEM
TERRORISTS
THE
CHINESE
WOULD
CERTAINLY
REFER
TO
THEM
AS
TERRORISTS
JUST
AS
THE
HITLER
REGIME
USED
TO
REFER
TO
EUROPEAN
RESISTANCE
MOVEMENTS
AS
TERRORISTS
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
GROUP
ADVOCATING
THIS
COURSE
IS
CORRECT
AND
GREATER
ATTENTION
IS
FOCUSSED
ON
THE
OCCUPATION
OF
TIBET
BY
THE
CHINESE
ARE
THE
TIBETANS
BETTER
OFF
AS
PEOPLE
OF
PEACE
OR
AS
TERRORISTS
BETTER
OFF
IN
WHAT
WAY
AS
PROPONENTS
OF
PACIFISM
OR
AS
PROPONENTS
OF
POLITICAL
AUTONOMY
AND
BETTER
OFF
IN
WHAT
TIMESCALE
THE
SOVIET
EMPIRE
PRACTISED
CULTURAL
GENOCIDE
AGAINST
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
HUNDRED
SMALL
MINORITIES
SOME
OF
WHICH
RESISTED
VIOLENTLY
AND
SOME
OF
WHICH
DID
NOT
BUT
IN
THE
END
IT
WAS
THE
SOVIET
EMPIRE
THAT
COLLAPSED
AND
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THE
MINORITIES
SURVIVED
NOW
SOME
OF
THE
MINORITIES
ARE
FIGHTING
ONE
ANOTHER
IS
THAT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
TO
OR
BECAUSE
VIOLENT
RESISTANCE
TO
AN
OPPRESSIVE
EMPIRE
LEGITIMIZED
VIOLENCE
