WRITES
IF
YOU
CAN
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
WHY
THE
DEATH
OF
JESUS
WAS
A
GOOD
THING
THEN
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
GLAD
TO
HEAR
IT
AND
YOU
MIGHT
EVEN
CONVERT
ME
BE
WARNED
HOWEVER
THAT
IVE
HEARD
ALL
THE
MOST
COMMON
ARGUMENTS
BEFORE
AND
THEY
JUST
DONT
CONVINCE
ME
BE
WARNED
IT
IS
NOT
MY
JOB
TO
CONVERT
YOU
THAT
IS
THE
JOB
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
AND
I
FRANKLY
MAKE
A
LOUSY
ONE
I
AM
ONLY
HERE
TO
TESTIFY
YOUR
CONVERSION
IS
BETWEEN
YOU
AND
GOD
I
AM
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
IF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
FOLLOW
JESUS
OF
WHICH
I
INDEED
WOULD
BE
ESTATIC
THEN
ALL
THE
GLORY
BE
TO
GOD
