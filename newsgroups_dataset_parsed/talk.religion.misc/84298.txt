BRIAN
CECCARELLI
WRITES
KENT
WITH
REGARDS
TO
THE
INFORMATION
CONTAINED
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
IS
THE
ORIGINAL
CONTEXT
OF
THIS
THREAD
BRIAN
KENDIG
IS
INSIDE
A
HUGE
WALL
BRIAN
IS
INSIDE
THE
BIBLE
AND
THE
INFORMATION
CONTAINED
THEREIN
ARE
OUTSIDE
THE
WALL
UM
I
THINK
YOU
AND
THE
BIBLE
ARE
THE
ONES
INSIDE
THE
WALL
THERES
A
REALLY
WONDERFUL
WORLD
OUT
HERE
YOU
REALLY
SHOULD
PEEK
OUT
AT
IT
SOMETIME
THE
SILLY
THINGS
YOU
KEEP
SAYING
ONLY
REINFORCE
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
ARE
ON
OPPOSITE
SIDES
OF
A
VERY
HIGH
WALL
I
SEE
HOW
INCREDIBLY
BEAUTIFUL
THINGS
ARE
ON
MY
SIDE
AND
I
ONLY
KEEP
TELLING
YOU
ABOUT
IT
BECAUSE
ID
LIKE
TO
YOU
COME
JOIN
ME
HERE
BRIAN
KENDIG
PROVES
THIS
VERY
SAD
FACT
BY
THE
ABSURD
THINGS
HE
SAYS
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
I
GET
THROUGH
INTO
THE
FIREY
PIT
I
WILL
CEASE
TO
EXIST
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
I
SAID
THAT
I
WOULD
PREFER
TO
CEASE
TO
EXIST
THAN
TO
BE
TOSSED
INTO
ANY
GODS
VERSION
OF
HELL
I
AM
PROPOSING
TO
BRIAN
BRIAN
COME
UP
HERE
AND
TAKE
A
LOOK
FROM
THIS
VANTAGE
POINT
BUT
BRIAN
REPLIES
I
RATHER
NOT
THANK
YOU
I
AM
CONTENT
WHERE
I
AM
BESIDES
THE
VISTA
FROM
UP
THERE
STINKS
AND
IN
THE
MEANWHILE
BRIAN
IGNORES
THE
FACTS
THAT
HE
HAS
NEVER
UP
THERE
NOR
DOES
HE
REALIZE
I
HAD
SHARED
THE
SAME
PLATEAU
WHERE
BRIAN
NOW
STANDS
YOU
SAY
TO
ME
BRIAN
COME
UP
HERE
AND
TAKE
A
LOOK
FROM
THIS
VANTAGE
POINT
BUT
YOURE
IN
A
VALLEY
LOOKING
AT
A
CRAYON
DRAWING
OF
A
SUN
AND
A
TREE
AND
I
CANT
FOR
THE
LIFE
OF
ME
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
YOURE
SO
IMMERSED
IN
IT
IM
THE
ONE
TRYING
TO
GET
YOU
TO
COME
UP
HERE
DONT
YOU
SEE
BRIAN
KENDIG
JE
NE
SUIS
FAIT
COMME
AUCUN
BSKENDIGNETCOMCOM
DE
CEUX
QUE
JAI
VUS
JOSE
CROIRE
NETRE
FAIT
COMME
AUCUN
DE
CEUX
QUI
EXISTENT
THE
MEANING
OF
LIFE
SI
JE
NE
VAUX
PAS
MIEUX
AU
MOINS
JE
SUIS
AUTRE
IS
THAT
IT
ENDS
