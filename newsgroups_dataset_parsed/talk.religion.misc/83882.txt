HEALTH
INSURANCE
IN
DZKRIZOCFBERKELEYEDU
DENNIS
KRIZ
WRITES
I
RECENTLY
HAVE
BECOME
AWARE
THAT
MY
HEALTH
INSURANCE
INCLUDES
COVERAGE
FOR
ABORTION
I
STRONGLY
OPPOSE
ABORTION
FOR
REASONS
OF
CONSCIENCE
IT
DISTURBS
ME
DEEPLY
TO
KNOW
THAT
MY
PREMIUMS
MAY
BE
BEING
USED
TO
PAY
FOR
THAT
WHICH
I
SINCERELY
BELIEVE
IS
MURDER
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
REQUEST
THAT
I
BE
EXEMPTED
FROM
ABORTION
COVERAGE
WITH
MY
HEALTH
PREMIUMS
REDUCED
ACCORDINGLY
I
SHARE
DENNISS
OUTRAGE
OVER
A
SIMILAR
MANNER
I
HAVE
RECENTLY
BECOME
AWARE
THAT
MY
HEALTH
INSURANCE
INCLUDES
COVERAGE
FOR
ILLNESS
AND
INJURIES
SUFFERED
BY
CHRISTIANS
IT
DISTURBS
ME
DEEPLY
TO
KNOW
THAT
MY
PREMIUMS
MAY
BE
USED
TO
PAY
FOR
THAT
WHICH
I
SINCERELY
BELIEVE
IS
DIVINE
PUNISHMENT
FOR
THEIR
SINFUL
CONDUCT
IN
ADDITION
THESE
FOLKS
ARE
ABLE
TO
AVAIL
THEMSELVES
OF
SUCH
ALTERNATIVE
THERAPIES
AS
LOURDES
FATIMA
MORRIS
CERULLO
BENNY
HINN
ETC
IN
ANY
CASE
AS
JESUS
SAVES
I
FEEL
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
FOR
THEM
TO
BE
COVERING
THEIR
BETS
AT
MY
EXPENSE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
REQUEST
THAT
I
BE
EXEMPTED
FROM
CHRISTIAN
COVERAGE
WITH
MY
HEALTH
PREMIUMS
REDUCED
ACCORDINGLY
