IN
REPLY
TO
DELETED
ARTICLE
ABOUT
NOKNOCK
SEARCHES
ARRESTS
HMM
THE
POLICE
STRATEGY
OF
BURSTING
IN
WITH
WEAPONS
DRAWN
CLEARLY
MARKED
AS
OFFICERS
AND
YELLING
POLICE
REPEATEDLY
THIS
IS
USED
EVERY
DAY
TO
BUST
DRUG
HOUSES
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
AWE
THE
SUSPECTS
INTO
SUBMISSION
WITH
SURPRISE
AND
DISPLAY
OF
FIREPOWERE
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
A
GUN
FIGHT
AS
FOR
NOT
KNOCKING
ITS
A
SAD
NECESSITY
IN
MANY
CASES
SINCE
THE
SUSPECTS
WILL
ATTEMPT
TO
ESCAPE
OR
EVEN
FIGHT
USUALLY
THIS
STRATEGY
WORKS
IF
IT
DIDNT
THEN
IT
WOULDNT
BE
USED
SO
COMMONLY
NOW
WOULD
IT
IN
GENERAL
NOKNOCK
RAIDS
ARE
TO
PRESERVE
EVIDENCE
LIKE
DRUGS
WHICH
CAN
BE
FLUSHED
DOWN
THE
TOILET
THEY
ARE
NOT
THE
STANDARD
WAY
TO
ARREST
A
VIOLENT
FELON
LIKE
A
BANK
ROBBER
IF
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
SEARCH
OR
PRESERVE
EVIDENCE
THEY
WILL
JUST
SURROUND
THE
DWELLING
AND
ORDER
THE
SUSPECT
TO
COME
OUT
WITH
HER
HANDS
UP
IF
THE
SUSPECT
DOES
NOT
COME
OUT
TEAR
GAS
WILL
BE
USED
COMMENT
ON
THE
BD
OMITTED
I
MERELY
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
IS
A
VALID
STRATEGY
WHICH
IS
USED
EVERY
DAY
FURTHERMORE
WE
DONT
KNOW
OF
ANY
SUBSTITUTE
STRATEGY
CAPABLE
OF
APPREHENDING
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
AND
ARMED
SUSPECTS
DO
YOU
SUGGEST
IT
IS
NOT
A
METHOD
TO
APPREHEND
CRIMINALS
THAT
THE
POLICE
ALWAYS
KNOCK
WITH
GUNS
HOLSTERED
AND
NEVER
ARREST
ANY
SUSPECTS
UNTIL
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
ALLOWED
TO
INSPECT
THE
OFFICERSS
BADGES
JUST
WHAT
SHOULD
THE
POLICE
DO
WHEN
APPREHENDING
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
AND
ARMED
SUSPECTS
HOW
FAR
CAN
THEY
REASONABLY
GO
TO
IDENTITY
THEMSELVES
WHAT
DO
YOU
SUGGEST
THEY
CAN
DO
WHICH
CANT
BE
FAKED
BY
THE
COMPETITION
IT
IS
A
VERY
DANGEROUS
METHOD
TO
OBTAIN
EVIDENCE
THAT
MIGHT
BE
DESTROYED
IF
A
WARRANT
IS
SERVED
IN
THE
NORMAL
WAY
IT
IS
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
WAY
TO
ARREST
ANYONE
THE
COPS
ARE
CHARGING
INTO
A
ROOM
AND
THEY
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IS
IN
IT
IT
IS
MUCH
SAFER
TO
SURROUND
THE
PLACE
AND
ANNOUNCE
YOURSELF
EVEN
IF
YOUVE
GOT
DEADLY
ENEMIES
WHO
MAY
PRETEND
TO
BE
COPS
THATS
NOT
AN
EXCUSE
TO
MURDER
POLICE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
BDS
THERE
WAS
ALMOST
DEFINITELY
AT
MOST
THE
PARANOID
DELUSION
OF
DEADLY
ENIMIES
WHO
WOULD
PRETEND
TO
BE
COPS
COPS
ARE
NOT
COPS
UNTIL
THEY
IDENTIFY
THEMSELVES
AS
POLICE
OFFICERS
MOST
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
PROFESSIONAL
CRIMINALS
ARE
AWARE
OF
THE
LIKELIHOOD
OF
ARREST
BUT
THEY
ALSO
KNOW
HOW
THE
SYSTEM
WORKS
IF
THEY
ARE
ARRESTED
THEY
CALL
THEIR
LAWYER
POST
BAIL
AND
HOPE
FOR
A
PLEA
BARGAIN
IF
THEY
PULL
A
GUN
AND
SHOOT
A
COP
DURING
A
RAID
THEY
WILL
BE
CHARGED
WITH
FIRST
DEGREE
MURDER
IF
THEY
SURVIVE
THE
RAID
DRUG
DEALERS
HAVE
GUNS
FOR
PROTECTION
FROM
THEIR
CUSTOMERS
AND
OTHER
CRIMINALS
NOT
TO
SHOOT
COPS
COPS
ARE
SHOT
ON
NOKNOCK
DRUG
RAIDS
BECAUSE
THE
CRIMINALS
ARENT
AWARE
THAT
THEY
ARE
COPS
NOKNOCK
RAIDS
ON
HOMES
OCCUPIED
BY
NONCRIMINALS
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
END
IN
DISASTER
MOM
AND
POP
CITIZEN
KNOW
THAT
THEY
HAVE
NOT
COMMITTED
ANY
CRIME
THEY
KNOW
THAT
ANYONE
BREAKING
INTO
THEIR
HOUSE
CANNOT
BE
A
COP
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
DONE
NOTHING
WRONG
IF
THEY
HAVE
THE
MEANS
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
THEY
MAY
BECAUSE
THEY
KNOW
THAT
THE
HOUSEBREAKERS
ARE
CRIMINALS
NOT
COPS
COPS
AND
HOMEOWNERS
MAY
DIE
THE
FIRST
REPORTS
FROM
WACO
STATED
THAT
THE
ATF
HAD
A
WARRANT
TO
SEARCH
FOR
ILLEGAL
WEAPONS
AND
ALSO
AN
ARREST
WARRANT
IF
THE
ILLEGAL
WEAPONS
WERE
FOUND
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
NOKNOCK
WARRANT
WAS
NOT
CALLED
FOR
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
FLUSH
A
GUN
DOWN
THE
TOILET
THE
ATF
COULD
HAVE
SURROUNDED
THE
COMPOUND
A
MARKED
POLICE
CAR
COULD
HAVE
DRIVEN
UP
TO
THE
ENTRANCE
AND
UNIFORMED
OFFICERS
COULD
HAVE
KNOCKED
AND
SERVED
THE
WARRANT
USUAL
WAY
IT
THIS
HAD
HAPPENED
AND
AND
KORESH
REFUSED
THE
WARRANT
OR
DROVE
THE
COPS
OFF
AT
GUN
POINT
THEN
MOST
OF
THE
TPG
FOLKS
WOULD
HAVE
KEPT
QUIET
ROD
ANDERSON
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THE
UNITED

GOVERNMENT
BOULDER
CO
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
FACT
THAT
A
