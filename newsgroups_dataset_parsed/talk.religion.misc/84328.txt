RE
AFTER
YEARS
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY
IS
IN
ARTICLE
FRANK
ODWYER
WRITES
FIRSTLY
SCIENCE
HAS
ITS
BASIS
IN
VALUES
NOT
THE
OTHER
WAY
ROUND
SO
YOU
BETTER
EXPLAIN
WHAT
OBJECTIVE
ATOMS
ARE
AND
HOW
WE
GET
THEM
FROM
SUBJECTIVE
VALUES
BEFORE
WE
GO
ANY
FURTHER
ATOMS
ARE
NOT
OBJECTIVE
THEY
ARENT
EVEN
REAL
WHAT
SCIENTISTS
CALL
AN
ATOM
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
MATHEMATICAL
MODEL
THAT
DESCRIBES
CERTAIN
PHYSICAL
OBSERVABLE
PROPERTIES
OF
OUR
SURROUNDINGS
ALL
OF
WHICH
IS
SUBJECTIVE
WHAT
IS
OBJECTIVE
THOUGH
IS
THE
APPROACH
A
SCIENTIST
TAKES
IN
DISCUSSING
HIS
MODEL
AND
HIS
OBSERVATIONS
THERE
IS
NO
OBJECTIVE
SCIENCE
BUT
THERE
IS
AN
OBJECTIVE
APPROACH
WHICH
IS
SUBJECTIVELY
SELECTED
BY
THE
SCIENTIST
OBJECTIVE
IN
THIS
CASE
MEANS
A
SPECIFIED
UNCHANGING
SET
OF
RULES
THAT
HE
AND
HIS
COLLEAGUES
USE
TO
DISCUSS
THEIR
SCIENCE
THIS
IS
IN
CONTRAST
TO
YOUR
OBJECTIVE
MORALITY
THERE
MAY
BE
AN
OBJECTIVE
APPROACH
TO
SUBJECTIVELY
DISCUSS
YOUR
BELIEFS
ON
MORALITY
BUT
THERE
EXISTS
NO
OBJECTIVE
MORALITY
ALSO
SCIENCE
DEALS
WITH
HOW
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
OUR
OBSERVATIONS
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
AROUND
US
IN
THAT
THE
METHOD
OF
DISCUSSION
IS
OBJECTIVE
NOT
THE
SCIENCE
NOT
THE
DISCUSSION
ITSELF
SCIENCE
MAKES
NO
CLAIMS
TO
KNOW
THE
WHYS
OR
EVEN
THE
HOWS
SOMETIMES
OF
WHAT
WE
CAN
OBSERVE
IT
SIMPLY
GIVES
US
A
WAY
TO
DISCUSS
OUR
SURROUNDINGS
IN
A
MEANINGFUL
CONSISTENT
WAY
I
THINK
IT
WAS
NEILS
BOHR
WHO
SAID
TO
PARAPHRASE
SCIENCE
IS
WHAT
WE
CAN
SAY
ABOUT
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
