M
SKIBA
ENTIRELY
MISSED
MY
POINT
IN
MY
PREVIOUS
POSTING
IN
WHICH
I
WROTE
COMMENT
SHORTLY
AFTER
THAT
POST
I
REALIZED
TWO
THINGS
I
WAS
RUNNING
A
FEVER
OF
OVER
AND
THAT
I
PROBABLY
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
GONE
DIRECTLY
FROM
READING
ALTSLACK
TO
POSTING
ON
THIS
AUGUST
NEWSGROUP
IT
IS
NOT
AD
HOMINEN
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
MR
ARCHER
WILLINGLY
PRINTS
BLATANT
LIES
IN
DEFENSE
OF
BIBLE
INERRANCY
AND
THUS
IS
WORTHLESS
AS
AN
EXPERT
WITNESS
OKAY
IM
GAME
GIVE
US
A
LISTING
OF
BLATANT
LIES
FROM
ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF
BIBLICAL
DIFFICULTIES
OR
OTHER
ARCHER
WRITINGS
THAT
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
IF
ONLY
A
VERY
SHORT
LIST
CAN
BE
GENERATED
I
THINK
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
MR
ARCHER
WITH
HIS
INERANCY
MINDSET
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
IMPARTIAL
AND
MADE
A
DOOZY
OF
A
MISTAKE
IMHO
I
ALSO
THINK
THAT
THIS
MINDSET
TENDS
TO
GENERATE
THESE
SORTS
OF
MISTAKES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
A
LONG
LIST
CAN
BE
GENERATED
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
MR
ARCHER
INTENTIONALLY
USES
DECEPTION
IN
HS
BOOKS
WHY
SHOULD
HE
BE
DECEPTIVE
JUST
WITH
TYRE
SO
ARCHER
IS
JUST
SITTING
AROUND
RUBBING
HIS
HANDS
AND
PLOTTING
HOW
NEXT
TO
DECEIVE
OK
LETS
SEE
THE
LIST
THIS
WAS
AN
OPEN
QUESTION
I
ASSUMED
THAT
IF
MR
ARCHER
IS
A
CHRONIC
LIAR
SOMEONE
WHOULD
HAVE
DOCUMENTED
IT
THIS
ASSUMPTION
IS
BASED
ON
HOW
TALKORIGINS
REGULARS
HAVE
DOCUMENTED
NUMEROUS
CASES
OF
CREATIONIST
DECEPTIONS
SUCH
AS
DUANE
GUISH
AND
HIS
FRIENDS
NO
LONG
LIST
OF
ARCHER
MISTAKES
HAS
YET
BEEN
GIVEN
SO
THIS
MAY
BE
JUST
AN
ISOLATED
INCIDENT
