JESUS
GIVES
MORE
REASONS
IN
JOHN
BUT
ONE
OBVIOUS
REASON
WHY
JESUS
DIED
AND
AS
WITH
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IT
HAS
NOTHING
DO
WITH
HIS
PUNISHMENT
WAS
THAT
HE
COULD
RISE
TO
LIFE
AGAINSO
THAT
WE
WOULD
STOP
DOUBTING
AND
BELIEVE
JOHN
THE
FACT
THAT
JESUS
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
IS
MY
HOPE
THAT
I
TOO
WILL
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
IT
IS
AN
OBVIOUS
POINT
DO
NOT
OVERLOOK
IT
WITHOUT
THIS
OBVIOUS
POINT
I
WOULD
HAVE
NO
HOPE
AND
MY
FAITH
WOULD
BE
VANITY
GLAD
TO
HEAR
THIS
JUST
A
NOTE
OSIRIS
MITHRAS
AND
MANY
OTHER
CULT
GODS
RESURRECTED
AS
WELL
SO
THERES
A
GOOD
CHANCE
FOR
ALL
OF
US
TO
MAYBE
END
UP
IN
A
VIRTUAL
REALITY
SIMULATOR
AND
LIVE
FOREVER
HURRAH
SORRY
THIS
WAS
A
JOKE
SOME
SORT
OF
ONE
ANYWAY
IM
THE
FIRST
