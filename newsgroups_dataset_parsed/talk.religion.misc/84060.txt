RE
THE
FACT
OF
THE
THEORY
JIM
AND
ANDY
BOTH
HAVE
IT
INCORRECT
I
BELIEVE
THE
FACTS
ARE
WHAT
IS
THERE
THE
PROCESSES
THAT
EXIST
IN
THE
PRESENT
OR
THE
PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
PROCESSES
HAVING
OCCURED
IN
THE
PAST
THESE
FACTS
EXIST
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
A
THEORY
THE
THEORY
TRIES
AND
EXPLAINS
THE
FACTS
AND
HOW
THEY
RELATE
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
IS
BOTH
COHERENT
AND
USEFUL
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
USED
TO
MAKE
PREDICTIONS
THE
FACTS
OF
GRAVITY
EVOLUTION
ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION
RELATIVITY
ATOMS
WILL
EXIST
AND
BEHAVE
IN
THE
WAY
IN
WHICH
THEY
BEHAVE
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
WE
HAVE
A
THEORY
TO
TRY
AND
EXPLAIN
HOW
THEY
INTERACT
OR
EVEN
WHY
A
THEORY
NEVER
REALLY
BECOMES
A
FACT
BUT
A
THEORY
CAN
PREDICT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
PREVIOUSLY
UNKNOWN
FACT
AND
IF
WE
FIND
THIS
FACT
AS
THE
THEORY
PREDICTED
WE
SAY
THE
THEORY
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
FACTS
A
THEORY
IS
A
MENTAL
CONSTRUCT
A
SPECULATION
A
MODEL
IF
IT
IS
A
GOOD
MODEL
IT
MAY
BE
USEFUL
IN
SCIENCE
A
THEORY
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
EVIDENCE
CONSIDERABLE
EVIDENCE
SOMETIMES
ALL
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
A
HYPOTHESIS
IS
A
NEW
FLEDGLING
THEORY
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NOT
YET
ENOUGH
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
IT
WHEN
A
NEW
HYPOTHESIS
IS
PROPOSED
TO
REPLACE
AN
EXISTING
THEORY
IT
MUST
EXPLAIN
ALL
OF
THE
FACTS
THAT
THE
CURRENT
THEORY
EXPLAINS
AND
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THE
FACTS
THAT
THE
CURRENT
THEORY
COULD
NOT
ANDOR
PREDICT
NEW
FACTS
IT
IS
SO
SIMPLE
IM
SURPRISED
THAT
THIS
SUBJECT
GETS
BEAT
TO
DEATH
ABOUT
ONCE
A
MONTH
A
QUICK
GLANCE
IN
A
DICTIONARY
WOULD
CLEAR
UP
OF
THE
CONFUSION
AND
BANDWIDTH
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
THEN
WE
COULD
TALK
ABOUT
REALLY
IMPORTANT
THINGS
LIKE
WHY
DO
MEN
HAVE
NIPPLES
