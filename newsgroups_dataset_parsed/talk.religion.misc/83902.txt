RE
CHRISTIAN
METAETHICS
IN
ARTICLE
MLSPANIXCOM
MICHAEL
SIEMON
WRITES
WELL
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
MAKING
THESE
THE
BASE
COMMANDMENTS
IS
THAT
THEY
ARENT
REDUCIBLE
TO
RULES
A
SET
OF
RULES
IS
A
MORAL
CODE
OR
A
LAW
CODE
OR
AN
ALGORITHM
FOR
ACTING
SUCH
THINGS
CAN
BE
VERY
HELPFUL
TO
INDIVIDUALS
OR
SOCIETIES
BUT
NOT
IF
THEY
ARE
USED
INSTEAD
OF
A
PERSONAL
INVOLVEMENT
IN
AND
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
ONES
ACTIONS
THE
TWO
COMMANDMENTS
ARE
RULES
THEY
ARE
MERELY
RULES
THAT
ARE
SO
VAGUE
THAT
THEY
ARE
PRACTICALLY
DEVOID
OF
MEANING
MICHAEL
SIEMON
ACKNOWLEDGES
THIS
EVERY
TIME
HE
WRITES
THAT
THE
RESOLUTION
OF
AN
ARGUMENT
OVER
THEM
TURNS
ON
SECULAR
AND
CULTURAL
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT
ARE
INDEPENDENT
OF
THESE
RULES
THE
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
IS
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
A
CALL
TO
ACT
AS
IF
YOU
WERE
GOD
AND
ACCEPTING
ULTIMATE
RESPONSIBILITY
IN
YOUR
EVERY
ACTION
THE
COMMANDMENT
TO
LOVE
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
AS
YOURSELF
CAN
BE
VIEWED
IN
PART
AS
REMINDING
MAN
THAT
HE
IS
NOT
GOD
AND
CANNOT
ACT
AS
IF
HE
HAS
ULTIMATE
RESPONSIBILITY
INDEED
MANY
TRADITIONS
PRESENT
AN
INTERPRETATION
WHERE
BELIEVERS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
INTERPRET
LOVING
ONES
NEIGHBOR
AS
FOLLOWING
VARIOUS
OTHER
RULES
AND
RELYING
ON
THEIR
GOD
TO
MAKE
THINGS
COME
OUT
RIGHT
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
BE
WRONG
FOR
MAN
TO
ASSUME
SUCH
ULTIMATE
RESPONSIBILITY
ONCE
AGAIN
WE
ARE
CONFRONTED
WITH
GOOD
SOUNDING
GOO
THAT
MEANS
WHATEVER
THE
READER
WANTS
IT
TO
MEAN
CONSERVATIVES
MAY
TWIST
THIS
ACT
AS
IF
YOU
WERE
GOD
TO
MEAN
LAY
DOWN
RULES
FOR
OTHER
PEOPLE
AND
BE
AS
NASTY
TO
THEM
AS
POSSIBLE
IF
THEY
DONT
KEEP
YOUR
RULES
THEY
ARE
SO
INSISTENT
AND
OBVIOUS
ABOUT
THIS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
CONVINCED
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
RIGHTLY
REJECT
THE
WHOLE
CONCEPT
THAT
SUCH
IDIOCY
IS
HOW
GOD
ACTS
AND
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
INTERPRETATION
IS
TWISTED
THERE
ARE
MANY
PASSAGES
IN
THE
BIBLE
THAT
IN
THEIR
MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD
READING
SHOW
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
BEHAVING
IN
JUST
THIS
WAY
MICHAEL
CANNOT
REFER
TO
BASE
CLAIMS
OR
BASE
COMMANDMENTS
TO
SHOW
THAT
SUCH
READINGS
ARE
TWISTED
BECAUSE
THIS
DIVERGENCE
IN
UNDERSTANDING
OCCURS
EVEN
IN
TRYING
TO
INTERPRET
THE
BASE
CLAIMS
AND
COMMANDMENTS
IN
ADDRESSING
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
MICHAEL
WILL
NECESSARILY
DRAW
UPON
SECULAR
AND
CULTURAL
NOTIONS
THAT
THESE
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
WILL
REJECT
BUT
WHY
SHOULD
ANYONE
BE
LOOKING
FOR
AN
ETHICAL
SYSTEM
SINCE
OUR
SOCIETY
IS
EAGER
TO
HAND
US
ONE
OR
MORE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
WE
DO
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
WE
NEED
A
PRINCIPLE
FOR
THE
CRITIQUE
OF
ETHICAL
SYSTEMS
IN
WHICH
CASE
I
WILL
PROFER
THE
AGAPATE
ALLELOU
ONCE
AGAIN
BUT
THESE
BASE
COMMANDMENTS
ARE
TOO
VAGUE
TO
SERVE
AS
A
PRINCIPLE
FOR
THE
CRITIQUE
OF
ETHICAL
SYSTEMS
THE
MEANING
OF
THESE
BASE
COMMANDMENTS
FOR
ANY
BELIEVER
DERIVES
FROM
THE
SECULAR
AND
CULTURAL
NOTIONS
THAT
THE
BELIEVER
BRINGS
TO
THEM
FROM
HOW
THE
BELIEVER
MIXES
THEIR
DEMANDS
WITH
STRAIGHTFORWARD
READINGS
OF
OTHER
BIBLICAL
PASSAGES
FROM
A
PARTICULAR
SECTARIAN
TRADITION
OR
FROM
SOME
COMBINATION
OF
THESE
THINGS
THESE
COMMANDMENTS
LACK
SUFFICIENT
SUBSTANCE
IN
THEMSELF
TO
SERVE
AS
A
BASIS
FOR
CRITICIZING
ETHICAL
SYSTEMS
WHAT
MEANING
THEY
HAVE
COMES
FROM
THE
ETHICAL
SYSTEM
THE
BELIEVER
BRINGS
TO
THESE
COMMANDMENTS
AND
DIFFERENT
BODIES
OF
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
URGED
DIFFERENT
ETHICAL
SYSTEMS
OR
IN
SOME
CASES
NONE
AS
A
RESULT
IT
IS
BIZARRE
TO
IDENTIFY
ANY
ONE
OF
THESE
SYSTEMS
HOWEVER
POPULAR
OR
INFAMOUS
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
CHRISTIANITY
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
TORAH
IT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
QURAN
SPECIFICALLY
CHRISTIAN
SCRIPTURE
HAS
VERY
LITTLE
IF
ANYTHING
IN
THE
WAY
OF
COMMANDMENTS
SO
LITTLE
THAT
THE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
DESPERATELY
WANT
COMMANDMENTS
GO
MINING
FOR
THEM
WITH
ALMOST
NO
SUPPORT
THE
ONE
SINGLE
THING
IN
THE
GOSPELS
WHICH
JESUS
SPECIFICALLY
GIVES
AS
A
COMMANDMENT
TO
US
IS
LOVE
ONE
ANOTHER
JESUS
EXPLICITLY
STATES
THAT
THIS
SUMMARIZES
JEWISH
LAW
WHICH
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BRING
IN
ALL
OF
IT
IF
WE
PROPERLY
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
IT
MEANS
TO
LOVE
GOD
AND
LOVE
OUR
NEIGHBORS
THERE
ARE
MANY
PARABLES
AND
TEACHINGS
THE
GOSPELS
ATTRIBUTE
TO
JESUS
THAT
ARE
STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
READ
AS
ETHICAL
COMMANDMENTS
THE
PAULINE
EPISTLES
ARE
SIMILARLY
FULL
IF
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
THAT
THESE
ALL
COME
TOGETHER
IN
A
SENSIBLE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
ETHICAL
BEHAVIOR
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
A
LACK
OF
RAW
MATERIAL
I
AM
A
RADICAL
CHRISTIAN
ONLY
IN
THAT
I
TAKE
THE
GOSPEL
SERIOUSLY
NO
MICHAEL
THE
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
ALSO
TAKE
THE
GOSPEL
SERIOUSLY
WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES
YOU
IS
THE
WAY
YOU
INTERPRET
THE
GOSPEL
WHY
DONT
I
AND
THE
MYRIADS
OF
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
LIKE
ME
TELL
YOU
SOMETHING
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
IN
A
SENSE
THE
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
INTERPRETATIONS
DOES
TELL
US
SOMETHING
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
IT
TELLS
US
THAT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
AUTHORS
LEFT
A
SUFFICIENTLY
VAGUE
HODGEPODGE
THAT
IT
CAN
SERVE
AS
THE
SOURCE
TEXT
FOR
MANY
VASTLY
DIFFERENT
BELIEFS
ABOUT
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
AND
ABOUT
WHAT
MEN
SHOULD
AND
SHOULDNT
DO
THE
IRONY
HERE
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIANITY
PER
SE
THAT
MICHAEL
CAN
USE
TO
SUPPORT
THE
CAUSE
OF
LESBIANS
AND
GAYS
EVERY
CHRISTIAN
PRINCIPLE
HE
TURNS
TO
THIS
CAUSE
IS
EFFECTIVE
ONLY
THROUGH
THE
EXTRACHRISTIAN
PRINCIPLES
THROUGH
WHICH
MICHAEL
INTERPRETS
HIS
RELIGION
AND
THE
HOMOPHOBES
APPLY
THE
SAME
CHRISTIAN
PRINCIPLES
WITH
EQUAL
JUSTIFICATION
TO
THEIR
CAUSE
IN
SHORT
IT
IS
THE
EXTRACHRISTIAN
PRINCIPLES
THAT
MAKE
MICHAELS
CHRISTIANITY
BENEFICIAL
AND
I
SUSPECT
THEY
WOULD
BE
AS
BENEFICIAL
PERHAPS
MORESO
WITHOUT
BEING
FILTERED
BY
CHRISTIAN
INTERPRETATION
MICHAEL
PAINTS
A
PICTURE
OF
STANDARD
AMERICAN
ATHEISM
AS
THE
REJECTION
OF
THE
EVIL
IN
MANY
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIAN
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
BUT
I
THINK
IT
IS
EVEN
MORE
DAMAGING
TO
CHRISTIANITY
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
PRESENTS
SUCH
A
VAGUE
HODGEPODGE
OF
NOTIONS
ABOUT
THE
NATURE
OF
GOD
AND
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
GOOD
EXCEPT
OF
COURSE
WHEN
IT
IS
ORDERED
BY
AN
INTERPRETATION
THAT
RELIES
ON
EXTRANEOUS
PRINCIPLES
HERE
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
APPLY
A
CHRISTIAN
PARABLE
WHERE
A
COLD
DRINK
CAN
HAVE
ITS
VALUE
AND
A
HOT
DRINK
CAN
HAVE
ITS
VALUE
BUT
THE
LUKEWARM
WE
SHOULD
SPIT
OUT
RUSSELL
