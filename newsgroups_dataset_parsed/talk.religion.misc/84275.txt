if
i
make
a
statement
that
god
exists
loves
me
etc
but
in
no
way
insist
that
you
believe
it
does
that
place
a
burden
of
proof
upon
me
if
you
insist
that
god
doesnt
exist
does
that
place
a
burden
of
proof
upon
you
i
give
no
proofs
i
only
give
testimony
to
my
beliefs
i
will
respond
to
proofs
that
you
attempt
to
disprove
my
beliefs
if
you
say
x
statement
and
give
it
the
authority
of
fact
i
will
respond
by
asking
you
why
you
arent
obligated
to
say
anything
but
if
your
intent
is
to
convince
me
that
x
statement
is
true
then
yes
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
you
if
you
are
merely
giving
testimony
to
your
beliefs
then
you
are
an
egotist
why
would
i
care
to
surmise
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
you
if
you
wish
us
to
believe
that
what
you
say
is
true
