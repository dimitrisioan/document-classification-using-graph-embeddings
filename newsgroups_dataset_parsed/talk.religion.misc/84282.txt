WHY
IS
THE
NT
TOSSED
OUT
AS
INFO
ON
JESUS
I
REALIZE
IT
IS
NORMALLY
TOSSED
OUT
BECAUSE
IT
CONTAINS
MIRACLES
BUT
WHAT
ARE
THE
OTHER
REASONS
IT
IS
NOT
TOSSED
OUT
AS
A
SOURCE
BUT
WOULD
IT
BE
REGARDED
AS
UNBIASED
AND
INDEPENDANT
THIS
BRINGS
UP
ANOTHER
SOMETHING
I
HAVE
NEVER
UNDERSTOOD
I
ASKED
THIS
ONCE
BEFORE
AND
GOT
A
FEW
INTERESTING
RESPONSES
BUT
SOMEHOW
DIDNT
SEEM
SATISFIED
WHY
WOULD
THE
NT
NOT
BE
CONSIDERED
A
GOOD
SOURCE
CONTRADICTING
ITSELF
ON
FACTS
FOR
EXAMPLE
