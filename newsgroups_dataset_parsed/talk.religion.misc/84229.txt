waco
conflagration
precedents
burning
yourself
alive
seems
a
rough
way
to
go
given
the
waco
bunch
had
other
choices
but
it
reminded
me
of
the
russian
oldbelievers
who
thinking
the
antichrist
was
coming
in
grew
frantic
when
peter
the
great
started
westernizing
russia
and
reforming
the
russian
church
a
few
years
later
they
locked
themselves
in
their
churches
and
burned
themselves
alive
by
the
thousands
are
there
other
cases
of
apocalypseobsessed
christians
resorting
to
selfimolation
is
there
a
history
of
precedents
