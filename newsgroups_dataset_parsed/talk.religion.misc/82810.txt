THE

YOUR

ARE

I
REALLY
SAID

ACTUALLY
MR

YOU
SAID
THAT
THERE
WAS
BENEFIT
TO
OUR
ARGUMENT
IN
THAT
IT
CAUSED
TO
TO
REDISCOVER
BULLINGERS

I
DID
NOT

IM
SURE
IM
ONLY
RESPONDING
TO
THIS
ONE
YOU
HAVE
DIRECTED
RE

VIEWS
BECAUSE
ITS
ENJOYABLE
THUS
I
APOLOGIZE
FOR
THINKING
THAT
EVEN
MR

COULD
FIND
SUCH
DREK
CONVINCINGHE
SHOULD
SPECIFY
WHICH
PARTS
OF

HE
FINDS
CONVINCING
AND
QUIT
HIDING
BEHIND
A
DISINGENUOUS
MASK
OF
THIS
IS
WHAT
BULLINGER
BELIEVED
NOT
NECESSARILY
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
SO
WHICH
IS
IT
MR

DO
YOU
FIND
THE
EXEGISIS
CONVINCING
OR
NOT
MY
REPLY
ONE
OF
MY
PURPOSES
IN
DEBATING
THESE
ALLEGED

WITH

AND

IS
TO
DISEMINATE
MANY
DIFFERENT
VIEWS
OF
POSSIBLE
RECONCILIATIONS
RAISED
BY
VARIOUS
BIBLE
SCHOLARS
AND
STUDENTS
ALIKE
WHEN
I
PRESENT
MY
VIEWS
I
WILL
CLEARLY
DISTINGUISH
THEM
FROM
NOW
ON
DB
OF
COURSE
WITHOUT
ARCHER
AND
BULLINGER
WE
FIND
THAT
MR
DECENSO
HAS
PRESENTED
NO
GREEK
EXEGISIS
AT
ALL
AND
MR
DECENSO
HAS
MADE
A
BIG
THING
ABOUT
MY
NOT
REFERRING
BACK
TO
THE
ACTUAL
GREEK
THUS
WE
FIND
THIS
DEMAND
ON
HIS
PART
FOR
QUALITY
GREEK
EXEGISIS
TO
BE
A
HYPOCRITICAL
REQUIREMENT
MY

GOOD
POINT
BUT
IN
YOUR
DECLARING
THAT
THESE

ARE

YOU
HAVE
PRODUCED
ONLY
SUPERFICIAL
REASONINGS
AND
OBSERVATIONS
NOR
HAVE
YOU
DUG
DEEPER
IM
GLAD
YOU
HAVE
BEGUN
IN

I
WILL
BEGIN
GREEK

ON
THESE

IN

I
THOUGHT
NECESSARY

IT
WOULD
BE
APPROPRIATE
TO
LOOK

LETS

HE

SINCE

WE

MY

DO
YOU
FIND
SUCH

IMPORTANT
IF
SO
DO
YOU
PLAN
ON
STARTING
TO
USE
THEM
TO
THE
BEST
OF
YOUR
ABILITY
OR
WILL
YOU
CONTINUE
TO
PRESENT
SHALLOW
OBSERVATIONS
I
DONT
MEAN
THIS
IN
A
BAD
WAY
AT
THIS
POINT
IN
OUR
DEBATES
I
HAVE
NOT
FOUND
IT
NECESSARY
TO
PRESENT
A
TOTAL
EXEGETICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
THESE

SINCE
WE
SEEM
TO
KEEP
BEATING
AROUND
THE
BUSH
AND
NOT
GETTING
INTO
THE
CORE
OF
THE
VERSES
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IT
NECESSARY
TO
USE
MANY
OF
THE
ABOVE
CRITERIA
TO
REFUTE
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
RE
JUDAS
IN
ACTS
AND
MATTHEW
BUT
I
WILL
DO
MY
BEST
FROM
THIS
POINT
ON
TO
USE
SEVERAL
OF
THE
ABOVE
CRITERIA
SINCE
YOU
DESIRE
ME
TO
I
HOPE
YOU
WILL
ALSO
IT
WILL
GREATLY
ENHANCE
OUR
STUDY
OF
THESE
PASSAGES
DB
THE
ONLY
THING
HE
HAS
ACTUALLY
USED
BEYOND
THE
PASSAGE
ITSELF
IS
ANY
OTHER
PASSAGE
THUS
MR
DECENSO
SHOULD
BE
HONEST
AND
NOTE
THAT
MOST
OF
HIS
LIST
IS
RED
HERRING
AND
HIS
ONLY
REAL
CRITERIA
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
THE
TEXT
ITSELF
B
PARALLEL
PASSAGES
MY
REPLY
THE
REASON
IS
SIMPLEYOU
ARE
MISTATING
THE
PASSAGES
YOU
CLAIM
THAT
THE
PASSAGES
CONTRADICT
ONE
ANOTHER
I
DO
NOT
SEE
THE
PASSAGES
CONTRADICTING
ONE
ANOTHER
THEY
MAY
VERY
WELL
BE
COMPLIMENTARY
AS
MANY
SCHOLARLY
SOURCES
MENTION
MATTHEW
MAY
NOT
BE
PRESENTING
JUDAS
DEATH
AS
YOU
CLAIM
BUT
WELL
LOOK
AT
YOUR
DEFENSE
OF
THIS
LATER
ALSO
THE
REWARD
OF
INIQUITY
IN
THE
ACTS
PASSAGE
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
PIECES
OF
SILVER
IN
MATTHEWS
PASSAGES
ALTHOUGH
YOU
HAVE
A
VALIANT
ATTEMPT
LATER
AT
STATING
WHY
YOU
BELIEVE
IT
IS
AT
THIS
BEGINNING
STAGES
IN
OUR
DEBATES
WE
ARE
LAYING
SOME
SCRIPTURAL
GROUNDWORK
WHICH
WILL
BE
EXPANDED
UPON
THROUGH
DEEPER
EXEGESIS
DB
OF
COURSE
THE
ONLY
REASON
I
CAN
SEE
TO
SO
DRASTICALLY
REINTERPRET
A
PASSAGE
AS
HE
HAS
DONE
WITH
JUDAS
DEATH
IS
TO
MAKE
IT
AGREE
WITH
ANOTHER
PASSAGE
SO
THAT
BOTH
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
CORRECT
MY
REPLY
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
I
HAVE
GIVEN
A
DIFFERENT
EXEGETICAL
VIEW
OF
THE
PASSAGES
IS
THAT
YOU
SEEM
TO
THINK
THE
MAJORITY
OF
SCHOLARSHIP
IS
WRONG
IN
CONCLUDING
THESE
PASSAGES
ARE
COMPLIMENTARY
HOWEVER
I
SEE
NO
PROBLEM
IN
TONY
ROSES
EXPLANATION
OF
JUDAS
DEATH
HOW
WOULD
YOU
EXPLAIN
THE
INACCURACY
BETWEEN
JUDAS
HANGING
HIMSELF
IN
MATTHEW
AND
FALLING
HEADLONG
HE
BURST
OPEN
THIS
QUESTION
OF
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
JUDAS
DIED
IS
ONE
WITH
WHICH
WE
ARE
CONSTANTLY
CONFRONTED
IN
OUR
TRAVELS
MANY
PEOPLE
POINT
TO
THE
APPARENT
DISCREPANCY
IN
THE
TWO
ACCOUNTS
AS
AN
OBVIOUS
IRRECONCILABLE
ERROR
SOME
HAVE
GONE
SO
FAR
AS
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
IDEA
OF
AN
INERRANT
BIBLE
IS
DESTROYED
BY
THESE
CONTRADICTORY
ACCOUNTS
HOWEVER
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
AT
ALL
MATTHEW
RELATES
THAT
JUDAS
HANGED
HIMSELF
WHILE
PETER
TELLS
US
HE
FELL
AND
WAS
CRUSHED
BY
THE
IMPACT
THE
TWO
STATEMENTS
ARE
INDEED
DIFFERENT
BUT
DO
THEY
NECESSARILY
CONTRADICT
EACH
OTHER
MATTHEW
DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
JUDAS
DID
NOT
FALL
NEITHER
DOES
PETER
SAY
THAT
JUDAS
DID
NOT
HANG
HIMSELF
THIS
IS
NOT
A
MATTER
OF
ONE
PERSON
CALLING
SOMETHING
BLACK
AND
THE
OTHER
PERSON
CALLING
IT
WHITE
BOTH
ACCOUNTS
CAN
BE
TRUE
AND
SUPPLEMENTARY
A
POSSIBLE
RECONSTRUCTION
WOULD
BE
THIS
JUDAS
HANGED
HIMSELF
ON
A
TREE
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
A
PRECIPICE
THAT
OVERLOOKED
THE
VALLEY
OF
HINNOM
AFTER
HE
HUNG
THERE
FOR
SOME
TIME
THE
LIMB
OF
THE
TREE
SNAPPED
OR
THE
ROPE
GAVE
WAY
AND
JUDAS
FELL
DOWN
THE
LEDGE
MANGLING
HIS
BODY
IN
THE
PROCESS
THE
FALL
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
BEFORE
OR
AFTER
DEATH
AS
EITHER
WOULD
FIT
THIS
EXPLANATION
THIS
POSSIBILITY
IS
ENTIRELY
NATURAL
WHEN
THE
TERRAIN
OF
THE
VALLEY
OF
HINNOM
IS
EXAMINED
FROM
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
VALLEY
YOU
CAN
SEE
ROCKY
TERRACES
TO
FEET
IN
HEIGHT
AND
ALMOST
PERPENDICULAR
THERE
ARE
STILL
TREES
AROUND
THE
LEDGES
AND
A
ROCKY
PAVEMENT
AT
THE
BOTTOM
THEREFORE
IT
IS
EASY
TO
CONCLUDE
THAT
JUDAS
STRUCK
ONE
OF
THE
JAGGED
ROCKS
ON
THIS
WAY
DOWN
TEARING
HIS
BODY
OPEN
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
WE
ARE
NOT
TOLD
HOW
LONG
JUDAS
REMAINED
HANGING
FROM
THE
TREE
OR
HOW
ADVANCED
WAS
THE
DECOMPOSITION
OF
HIS
BODY
BEFORE
HIS
FALL

THEN
PULLED
THE

LEAPED

ARE
TRUE
AS
BOTH
ARE
TRUE
IN
THE

OF

AND
PETERS
ACCOUNTS
OF
THE
DEATH
OF
JUDAS
IT
IS
MERELY
A
SITUATION
OF
DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVES
OF
THE
SAME
EVENT
YOUR
ONLY
REASON
FOR
REJECTING
THIS
IS
I
BELIEVE
YOUR
ATTEMPT

YOU
HAVENT

THIS
IS
IMPOSSIBLE

AT

MR

ONLY
ASKS
TWO
QUESTIONS

YOU
CLAIM
ACTS
AND
MATTHEW
CONTRADICT
ONE
ANOTHER
IN
REPRESENTING
JUDAS
DEATH
I
ASK
YOU
AGAIN
TO
PROVIDE
EVIDENCE
THAT
MATTHEW
STATED
JUDAS
DIED
IN
THE
HANGING
YOU
CLAIM
THAT
THE
PIECES
OF
SILVER
IN
MATTHEW
THAT
JUDAS
THREW
DOWN
IN
THE
TEMPLE
AND
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
USED
IS
THE
REWARD
OF
INIQUITY
IN
ACTS
THAT
PICTURES
JUDAS
IN
SOME
WAY
PURCHASING
A
FIELD
WITH
THEREFORE
THERE
IS
A
CONTRADICTION
PROVE
THAT
THE
PIECES
OF
SILVER
AND
THE
REWARD
OF
INIQUITY
ARE
ONE
AND
THE
SAME
ACTUALLY
I
FIND
QUESTION
TO
BE
A
RATHER
STUPID
REQUEST
BUT
I
WILL
ANSWER
IT
BECAUSE
HE
NOW
RESTRICTS
HIMSELF
TO
TWO
POINTS
FIRST
I
WOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
HANGING
IS
A
VERY
EFFICIENT
MANNER
FOR
ENDING
A
LIFE
IN
FACT
IT
IS
A
BIT
OF
A
FLUKE
WHEN
SOMEONE
SURVIVES
HANGING
EXCEPT
IN
FANTASY
COWBOY
MOVIES
AND
EVEN
THEN
IT
USUALLY
REFERRED
TO
AS
AN
ATTEMPTED
HANGING
MY
REPLY
I

CHILD
ABUSE
AND
NEGLECT
TODAY
I
GOT
A
CALL
RE
A
CHILD
THAT
ATTEMPTED
SUICIDE
BY
HANGING
HIMSELF
BECAUSE
HIS
MOTHER
IS
ON
CRACK
HE
FAILED
IN
HIS
ATTEMPT
AND
IS
IN
A
CHILDS
PSYCH
WARD
AT
A

HANGING
ATTEMPTS
ARE
NOT
ALWAYS
SUCCESSFUL
TO
ASSUME
THAT
BECAUSE
MOST
HANGINGS
ARE
SUCCESSFUL
THIS
ONE
WAS
ALSO
IS
BEGGING
THE
QUESTION
IF
I
MAY
QUOTE
YOU
LAST

TEACHES
COMPARATIVE

LOGIC
IT
WAS
INTERESTING
DB
THIS
IS
SO

THAT
SO
THAT
TO

IS
SYNONYMOUS

WE
HAVE
RE
JUDAS
HANGING
HIMSELF

THAT
JUDAS
DIED
AS

ITS

IT
HAS
THE

HE
LIVED

IS

YOU
DAVE

INTERESTINGLY
NOT

READ

THE

AS

ITS
OK

NOT

THEY

AM
SURE
YOU
WOULD
FIND
SOME
ERRORS

MAYBE
EVEN
SOME
DECEPTION
IN
THOSE

YOU
ALSO
NOTED
THEY
INTERPRETED
THE

THAT
IS

POSSIBLY

YOU

NO
YOU
CANT

THIS
ALTHOUGH
AS
TONY
SAYS
THIS
WAS
A
HIGHLY
PROBABLE
OUTCOME
BUT
MATTHEW
DOES
NOT
STATE
DEATH
AS
BEING
A

THE
GREEK

IS
APAGCHO
MATTHEW
IS
ITS
ONLY
OCCURRENCE
IN
THE
NEW

IN
THE
SEPTUAGINT
THE
GREEK
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
OT
USED
AT
THE
TIME
OF
JESUS
ITS
ONLY
USED
IN

NOW
WHEN
AHITHOPHEL
SAW

HIS
ADVICE
WAS
NOT
FOLLOWED
HE
SADDLED
A
DONKEY
AND
AROSE
AND
WENT
HOME
TO
HIS
HOUSE
TO
HIS
CITY
THEN
HE
PUT
HIS
HOUSEHOLD
IN
ORDER
AND
HANGED
HIMSELF
AND
DIED
AND
HE
WAS
BURIED
IN
HIS
FATHERS
TOMB
NOTICE
THAT
NOT

IS
IT
STATED
THAT
AHITHOPHEL
HANGED
HIMSELF
GR
SEPT
APAGCHO

IT
EXPLICITLY
ADDS

DIED
HERE
WE
HAVE
NO
DOUBT
OF
THE

IN

WE
ARE
NOT
EXPLICITLY
TOLD
JUDAS
DIED
ALSO
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN

YOU
ARE

REPUTABLE

MY

REPUTABLE
YOU
MEAN

HAVE
NEVER

AS
INSISTING
THAT
THE

UNSUCCESSFUL
THAT
CANT

AS
I
SAID
IN

ALTHOUGH
I
STILL
AGREE
WITH

EXEGESIS
AS
BEING
THE
MOST
PROBABLE
EXPLANATION
REGARDING
JUDAS
DEATH
TAKING
INTO

SEVERAL
CRITERIA
IVE
RECENTLY
NOTICED

THEN
HE
THREW
DOWN
THE
PIECES

SILVER
IN

DEPARTED

WENT

HANGED
HIMSELF
BUT
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
TOOK
THE
SILVER
PIECES
AND
SAID
IT
IS
NOT
LAWFUL
TO
PUT
THEM
INTO

THEY
ARE
THE
PRICE
OF
BLOOD
AND
THEY
CONSULTED
TOGETHER
AND
BOUGHT
WITH
THEM
THE
POTTERS
FIELD
TO
BURY
STRANGERS

THEREFORE
THAT
FIELD
HAS
BEEN
CALLED
THE
FIELD
OF
BLOOD
TO
THIS
DAY
FIRST
OF
ALL
NOTICE
THAT
THE

DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
JUDAS
DIED
AS
A

OF

ALL
IT
SAYS
IS
THAT
HE
WENT

HANGED
HIMSELF
LUKE

TELLS
US
THAT
AND
FALLING
HEADLONG
HE
BURST
OPEN
IN
THE

ALL
HIS

GUSHED
OUT
THIS
IS
A
PRETTY
CLEAR
INDICATION
ALONG
WITH
THE
OTHER
DETAILS
GIVEN
IN
ACTS
PETERS
SPEECH
THE
NEED
TO
PICK
A
NEW
APOSTLE
ETC
THAT
AT

AFTER

FALL
HE
WAS
DEAD

THE

HIGHLY
PROBABLE

THERE
IS
NO

MY

WE
DO
KNOW
FROM

THAT
HE
DID

ALTHOUGH
ITS
POSSIBLE

PLAUSIBLE
THAT

I
CAN
NO

NO

MATTHEW
DID
NOT

HE
MOST
SCHOLARS
BELIEVE
HE
PROBABLY
DID

I
QUOTED
ALL
THAT
TO

THAT
I
HIGHLY
REGARD
THE
SCHOLARS

IN
LOOKING
AT
THE

INITIALLY
WE
CANT
ASSUME
JUDAS
DIED
IT
IS
HOWEVER
HIGHLY
PROBABLE
DB
BY
THE
WAY
WHILE
ALL
AGREE
THAT
JUDAS
DIED
FROM

THE
BOOKS
HAD
DIFFERENT
WAYS
OF
DEALING
WITH

ARE

HUNG

MY

THE
OUTCOME
OF
ANY
FALL
IS
DEPENDENT
UPON
MANY
FACTORSHOW
HIGH
THE
PERSON
WAS
SUSPENDED
BEFORE
THE

ANY
OBSTRUCTIONS

AS

THAT
MAY
HAVE
DEVIATED

OF

THE
VICTIM
FELL

THUS
POSSIBLY
ROLLING
OR
BOUNCING

ETC
IN
A
SUPERFICIAL
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
ACTS
PASSAGE
AND
THE
MATTHEW
PASSAGE
WE
ARE
NOT
GIVEN
A
LOT
OF
INFO
ON
THE
GEOGRAPHICAL
SPECIFICS
BUT
TONY
IN
THE
ABOVE
QUOTED
POST
GAVE
US
SOME
A
POSSIBLE
RECONSTRUCTION
WOULD
BE
THIS
JUDAS
HANGED
HIMSELF
ON
A
TREE
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
A
PRECIPICE
THAT
OVERLOOKED
THE
VALLEY
OF
HINNOM
AFTER
HE
HUNG
THERE
FOR
SOME
TIME
THE
LIMB
OF
THE
TREE
SNAPPED
OR
THE
ROPE
GAVE
WAY
AND
JUDAS
FELL
DOWN
THE
LEDGE
MANGLING
HIS
BODY
IN
THE
PROCESS
THE
FALL
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
BEFORE
OR
AFTER
DEATH
AS
EITHER
WOULD
FIT
THIS
EXPLANATION
THIS
POSSIBILITY
IS
ENTIRELY
NATURAL
WHEN
THE
TERRAIN
OF
THE
VALLEY
OF
HINNOM
IS
EXAMINED
FROM
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
VALLEY
YOU
CAN
SEE
ROCKY
TERRACES
TO
FEET
IN
HEIGHT
AND
ALMOST
PERPENDICULAR
THERE
ARE
STILL
TREES
AROUND
THE
LEDGES
AND
A
ROCKY
PAVEMENT
AT
THE
BOTTOM
THEREFORE
IT
IS
EASY
TO
CONCLUDE
THAT
JUDAS
STRUCK
ONE
OF
THE
JAGGED
ROCKS
ON
THIS
WAY
DOWN
TEARING
HIS
BODY
OPEN
DB
NOW
TRUTHFULLY
I
DO
NOT
SEE
WHAT
IS
COMFORTING
ABOUT
MATTHEW
CONFUSING
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
POTTERS
FIELD
PROPHESY
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
AUTHOR
IS
CORRECT
MATTHEW
DOES
MAKE
THAT
CONFUSION
OF
COURSE
A
BIBLICAL
INERRANTIST
WHO
CLAIM
THAT
EVERY
WORD
OF
THE
BIBLE
IS
GUARANTEED
TRUE
BY
GOD
WILL
HAVE
TO
THEREBY
ADD
ONE
MORE
CONTRADICTION
TO
THE
DEATH
OF
JUDAS
IE
WHERE
THE
PROPHESY
OF
THE
POTTERS
FIELD
CAME
FROM
MY
REPLY
PLEASE
WHEN
WE
ARE
DONE
WITH
THIS
STUDY
ON
HIS
DEATH
REMIND
ME
TO
DISCUSS
THIS
WITH
YOU
DB
AS
TO
YOUR
SECOND
QUESTION
MR
DECENSO
YOU
ASK
HOW
WE
COULD
BE
SURE
THAT
THE
MONEY
WITH
WHICH
JUDAS
PURCHASED
THE
LAND
WAS
INDEED
FOR
THE
BETRAYAL
RATHER
THAN
SOME
OTHER
SOURCE
I
WOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
IN
ACTS
WHERE
IT
SPECIFICALLY
MENTION
THE
REWARD
OF
INIQUITY
ACTS
IT
ALSO
SPECIFICALLY
MENTIONS
WHAT
ACT
OF
INIQUITY
THEY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
IE
ACTS
CONCERNING
JUDAS
WHO
WAS
GUIDE
TO
THOSE
WHO
ARRESTED
JESUS
NOW
I
WOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
WHEN
THE
BIBLE
DESCRIBES
AN
ACT
OF
INIQUITY
AND
THEN
IMMEDIATELY
DISCUSSES
THE
REWARD
OF
INIQUITY
IT
WOULD
BE
RATHER
INANE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
IT
WAS
AN
ACTION
OF
INIQUITY
OTHER
THAN
THE
ONE
DISCUSSED
MY
REPLY
DAVE
WE
ARE
GETTING
SOMEWHERE
ARENT
WE
ACT
AND
IN
THOSE
DAYS
PETER
STOOD
UP
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
ALTOGETHER
THE
NUMBER
OF
NAMES
WAS
ABOUT
A
HUNDRED
AND
TWENTY
AND
SAID
ACT
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
THIS
SCRIPTURE
HAD
TO
BE
FULFILLED
WHICH
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
SPOKE
BEFORE
BY
THE
MOUTH
OF
DAVID
CONCERNING
JUDAS
WHO
BECAME
A
GUIDE
TO
THOSE
WHO
ARRESTED
JESUS
ACT
FOR
HE
WAS
NUMBERED
WITH
US
AND
OBTAINED
A
PART
IN
THIS
MINISTRY
ACT
NOW
THIS
MAN
PURCHASED
A
FIELD
WITH
THE
WAGES
OF
INIQUITY
AND
FALLING
HEADLONG
HE
BURST
OPEN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AND
ALL
HIS
ENTRAILS
GUSHED
OUT
ACT
AND
IT
BECAME
KNOWN
TO
ALL
THOSE
DWELLING
IN
JERUSALEM
SO
THAT
FIELD
IS
CALLED
IN
THEIR
OWN
LANGUAGE
AKEL
DAMA
THAT
IS
FIELD
OF
BLOOD
ACT
FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
PSALMS
LET
HIS
DWELLING
PLACE
BE
DESOLATE
AND
LET
NO
ONE
LIVE
IN
IT
AND
LET
ANOTHER
TAKE
HIS
OFFICE
NOTICE
THAT
IN
VERSE
THE
WORD
INIQUITY
IS
NOT
USED
RATHER
IT
STATES
THAT
JUDAS
BECAME
A
GUIDE
TO
THOSE
WHO
ARRESTED
JESUS
BUT
THE
WRITER
DID
NOT
STOP
THEREVS
FOR
HE
WAS
NUMBERED
WITH
US
AND
OBTAINED
A
PART
IN
THIS
MINISTRY
WHAT
PART
DID
JUDAS
PLAY
IN
THEIR
MINISTRY
JOH
THIS
HE
SAID
NOT
THAT
HE
CARED
FOR
THE
POOR
BUT
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
A
THIEF
AND
HAD
THE
MONEY
BOX
AND
HE
USED
TO
TAKE
WHAT
WAS
PUT
IN
IT
JOH
FOR
SOME
THOUGHT
BECAUSE
JUDAS
HAD
THE
MONEY
BOX
THAT
JESUS
HAD
SAID
TO
HIM
BUY
THOSE
THINGS
WE
NEED
FOR
THE
FEAST
OR
THAT
HE
SHOULD
GIVE
SOMETHING
TO
THE
POOR
SO
NOW
WE
KNOW
WHAT
PART
JUDAS
PLAYED
HE
WAS
A
TREASURER
PER
SE
RIGHT
AFTER
PETER
STATED
THAT
JUDAS
PLAYED
A
PART
IN
THIS
MINISTRY
TREASURER
ACCORDING
TO
JOHN
THEN
LUKE
ADDS
THE
PARENTHETICAL
EXPLANATION
OF
WAGES
OF
INIQUITY
MONEY
THAT
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PUT
INTO
THE
MINISTRY
BUT
WAS
STOLEN
BY
JUDAS
TO
PURCHASE
A
FIELD
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
A
BETTER
EXEGETICAL
EXPLANATION
OF
WHAT
THE
WAGES
OF
INIQUITY
ARE
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
DAVE
DB
NOW
SINCE
I
HAVE
GIVEN
YOU
CLEAR
ANSWERS
AND
EVEN
REFERENCES
PERHAPS
YOU
COULD
UNEQUIVOCALLY
STATE
WHAT
TYPE
OF
INERRANTIST
YOU
ARE
INSTEAD
OF
ASKING
ME
WHAT
TYPE
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
AS
YOU
DID
TO
MR
JOSLIN
MY
REPLY
I
WILL
GLADLY
ADMIT
THAT
I
AM
A
COMPLETE
INERRANTIST
ALTHOUGH
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
THAT
BIG
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
LIMITED
INERRANCY

IF

WISHED
