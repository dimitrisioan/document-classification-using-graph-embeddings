these
laws
written
for
the
israelites
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
jews
wont
agree
with
you
malcolm
which
jews
ks
ex
as
a
people
as
a
language
religiously
politically
or
do
you
mean
those
jews
who
are
gods
chosen
and
malcolm
please
if
you
will
set
your
word
wrap
at
or
less
to
avoid
clutter
