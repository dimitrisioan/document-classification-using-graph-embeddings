RE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IN
ARTICLE
JBROWNBATMANBMDTRWCOM
WRITES
THE
DEFAULT
CONDITION
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
A
PREPONDERANCE
OF
EVIDENCE
EITHER
WAY
IS
THAT
THE
PROPOSITION
OR
ASSERTION
IS
UNDECIDABLE
AND
THE
PERSON
WHO
TAKES
THE
UNDECIDABLE
POSITION
AND
SAYS
THAT
HESHE
SIMPLY
DISBELIEVES
THAT
THE
PROPOSITION
IS
TRUE
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
HOLDS
NO
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
SOCALLED
WEAK
ATHEIST
POSITION
IS
VIRTUALLY
UNASSAILABLE
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
STANDS
ON
A
FIRM
FOUNDATION
OF
LOGICAL
ARGUMENT
BUT
BECAUSE
ITS
PROPONENTS
SIMPLY
DISBELIEVE
IN
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GODS
AND
THEREFORE
THEY
HOLD
NO
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
WHEN
YOU
DONT
ASSERT
ANYTHING
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
PROVE
ANYTHING
THATS
WHERE
WEAK
ATHEISM
DRAWS
ITS
STRENGTH
BUT
ITS
STRENGTH
IS
ALSO
ITS
ACHILLES
HEEL
WITHOUT
ASSERTIONSAXIOMS
ONE
HAS
NO
FOUNDATION
UPON
WHICH
TO
BUILD
AS
A
PHILOSOPHY
ITS
VIRTUALLY
WORTHLESS
IMO
OF
COURSE
YES
AS
A
PHILOSOPHY
WEAK
ATHEISM
IS
WORTHLESS
THIS
IS
TRUE
IN
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
SENSE
THAT
AS
A
PHILOSOPHY
CHRISTIANS
DISBELIEF
IN
ZEUS
IS
WORTHLESS
ATHEISTS
CONSTRUCT
THEIR
PERSONAL
PHILOSOPHIES
FROM
MANY
DIFFERENT
SOURCES
BUILDING
NONGODBASED
IDEAS
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
AS
CHRISTIANS
BUILD
NONZEUSBASED
IDEAS
OF
THUNDERBOLTS
ATHEISTS
NO
MORE
BASE
THEIR
PHILOSOPHY
ON
ATHEISM
THAN
CHRISTIANS
BASE
THEIRS
ON
THE
NONEXISTENCE
OF
ZEUS
THE
WEAK
ATHEIST
POSITION
IS
LOGICALLY
EXTREMELY
ASSAILABLE
ANY
LOGICAL
DEMONSTRATION
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
GOD
COMPLETELY
DESTROYS
IT
AS
SOON
AS
THE
DEMONSTRATION
IS
MADE
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
GIVEN
WEAK
ATHEIST
ATHEISTS
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
ARE
BARRAGED
REGULARLY
WITH
ATTEMPTS
TO
PROVIDE
SUCH
A
LOGICAL
DEMONSTRATION
AND
THEY
ALL
FAIL
MISERABLY
IN
FACT
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AROUND
HERE
WHO
CLAIM
THE
STRONG
AS
OPPOSED
TO
MATHEMATICAL
ATHEIST
POSITION
DO
SO
ON
THIS
BASIS
NOT
ONLY
DO
WE
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
A
GOD
BUT
ALSO
ALL
THE
ARGUMENTS
PRESENTED
IN
FAVOR
OF
PARTICULAR
GODS
HAVE
TO
DATE
PROVEN
UNSOUND
THEREFORE
ONE
CAN
SAY
THAT
THOSE
GODS
AS
ARGUED
BY
THOSE
ARGUMENTS
DO
NOT
EXIST
THIS
DOESNT
APPLY
TO
SUCH
PHILOSOPHERS
GODS
AS
ARE
DEFINED
TO
BE
LOGICALLY
UNDEMONSTRABLE
BUT
THESE
ARE
NOT
THE
GODS
OF
POPULAR
RELIGION
AND
THE
COHERENCE
OF
SUCH
CLAIMS
IS
QUITE
QUESTIONABLE
