RE
MERLIN
MITHRAS
AND
MAGICK
IN
RESPONSE
TO
WHITTENFWVASAICCOM
DAVID
WHITTEN
I
WROTE
THERE
EVIDENTLY
WAS
A
FEAST
OF
BREAD
AND
WINE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
MITHRAS
I
HAVE
OFTEN
WONDERED
IF
YESHUA
INTENTIONALLY
INTRODUCED
THIS
RITUAL
TO
EXPAND
THE
APPEAL
OF
HIS
RELIGION
OR
IF
IT
WAS
APPROPRIATED
BY
LATER
WORSHIPERS
AND
YOU
RESPONDED
YOU
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
IF
YOU
WANTED
BUT
I
THINK
A
MORE
REASONABLE
ARGUMENT
WOULD
POINT
OUT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
REMEMBRANCE
FEAST
WAS
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
THE
PESACH
PASSOVER
MEAL
DURING
SEDER
A
VERY
JEWISH
RITUAL
OF
COURSE
THE
FEAST
WAS
THE
SEDER
AND
THE
ACCOUNTS
OF
IT
ARE
VERY
CLEAR
ON
THIS
POINT
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
THE
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
THE
BREAD
AND
WINE
AND
THE
BODY
AND
BLOOD
OF
GOD
THIS
IS
AN
OLD
ASSOCIATION
OF
THE
TAMMUZOSIRISMITHRAS
LINE
AND
NOT
REALLY
RELATED
TO
JUDAISM
IN
ANY
CASE
I
DIDNT
REALLY
INTEND
TO
ARGUE
THE
POINT
I
SAW
A
POSSIBLE
ASSOCIATION
AND
POINTED
IT
OUT
BUT
I
HAVENT
THE
FOGGIEST
NOTION
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENED
