in
many
ways
is
similar
it
was
a
mystery
cult
worship
in
which
not
all
the
information
was
available
to
all
members
tests
had
to
be
passed

each
stage
new
info
was
offered
to
the
worshipper
similar

mithras

sun

down
to
darkness
was
reborn
inspired

against
the

popular
and
charismatic

worship
originated
in
