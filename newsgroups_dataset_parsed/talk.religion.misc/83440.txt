OBJECTIVE
VALUES
V
SCIENTIFIC
ACCURACY
WAS
RE
AFTER
YEARS
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY
IS
FRANK
I
TRIED
TO
MAIL
THIS
BUT
IT
BOUNCED
IT
IS
FAST
MOVING
OUT
OF
TA
SCOPE
BUT
I
DIDNT
KNOW
IF
TA
WAS
THE
ONLY
GROUP
OF
THE
THREE
THAT
YOU
SUBSCRIBED
TO
APOLOGIES
TO
REGULAR
TA
FOLKS
IN
ARTICLE
FRANK
ODWYER
WRITES
SCIENCE
THE
REAL
WORLD
HAS
ITS
BASIS
IN
VALUES
NOT
THE
OTHER
WAY
ROUND
AS
YOU
WOULD
WISH
IT
YOU
MUST
BE
USING
VALUES
TO
MEAN
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
USED
NORMALLY
AND
YOU
ARE
CERTAINLY
USING
SCIENCE
LIKE
THAT
IF
YOU
EQUATE
IT
TO
THE
REAL
WORLD
SCIENCE
IS
THE
RECOGNITION
OF
PATTERNS
IN
OUR
PERCEPTIONS
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
AND
THE
MAKING
OF
QUALITATIVE
AND
QUANTITATIVE
PREDICTIONS
CONCERNING
THOSE
PERCEPTIONS
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
VALUES
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
VALUES
ARE
WELL
THEY
ARE
WHAT
I
VALUE
THEY
ARE
WHAT
I
WOULD
HAVE
RATHER
THAN
NOT
HAVE
WHAT
I
WOULD
EXPERIENCE
RATHER
THAN
NOT
AND
SO
ON
OBJECTIVE
VALUES
ARE
A
SET
OF
VALUES
WHICH
THE
PROPOSER
BELIEVES
ARE
APPLICABLE
TO
EVERYONE
IF
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
OBJECTIVE
VALUE
THEN
SCIENCE
CAN
NOT
OBJECTIVELY
BE
SAID
TO
BE
MORE
USEFUL
THAN
A
KICK
IN
THE
HEAD
I
DONT
AGREE
SCIENCE
IS
USEFUL
INSOFAR
AS
IT
THE
PREDICTIONS
MENTIONED
ABOVE
ARE
ACCURATE
THAT
IS
INSOFAR
AS
WHAT
I
THINK
WILL
BE
THE
EFFECT
ON
MY
PERCEPTIONS
OF
A
TIME
LAPSE
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
MY
INPUT
TO
THE
UNIVERSE
VERSUS
WHAT
MY
PERCEPTIONS
ACTUALLY
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
BUT
VALUES
ARE
ABOUT
WHETHER
I
LIKE
IN
THE
LOOSEST
SENSE
OF
THE
WORD
THE
PERCEPTIONS
SIMPLE
THEORIES
WITH
ACCURATE
PREDICTIONS
COULD
NOT
OBJECTIVELY
BE
SAID
TO
BE
MORE
USEFUL
THAN
A
SET
OF
TAROT
CARDS
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
USEFULNESS
IN
SCIENCE
IS
SYNONOMOUS
WITH
ACCURACY
PERIOD
TAROT
PREDICTIONS
ARE
NOT
USEFUL
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
ACCURATE
OR
CANT
BE
SHOWN
TO
BE
ACCURATE
SCIENCE
IS
USEFUL
BECAUSE
IT
IS
APPARENTLY
ACCURATE
VALUES
OBJECTIVE
OR
OTHERWISE
ARE
BESIDE
THE
POINT
NO
