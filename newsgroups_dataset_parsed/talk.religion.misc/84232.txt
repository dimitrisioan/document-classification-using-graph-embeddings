FOR
YOUR

I
CHECKED
THE
LIBRARY

CATALOG
AND
THEY
LIST
THE
FOLLOWING
BOOKS
BY
FRANCIS
HITCHING
I
BELIEVE
IVE
JUST
DISCOVERED
AN
ANTHOPOLOGICAL
PARALLEL
IN
MY
MANY
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
THE
FUNDIES
THEIR
MAIN
TACTIC
IS
TO
DISCREDIT
MY
SOURCES

POSSIBLY
THE
PARALLEL
JUST
STEMS
FROM
YOUR
TENDING

USE
BAD
SOURCES

THE

EUROPEAN
PHILOSOPHER

SAID
THAT
IF
REASON

REASON
SHOULD
BE
GIVEN
PREFERENCE
AND
IF
THAT
DOESNT
SOUND
REASONABLE
TO
YOU
YOULL
JUST
