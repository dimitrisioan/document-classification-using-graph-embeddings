specifically
when
i
bring
up
the
fact
that
genesis
contains
two
contradictory
creation
stories
i
usually
get
blank
stares
or
flat
denials
ive
never
had
a
fundamentalist
acknowledge
that
there
are
indeed
two
different
accounts
of
creation
that
is
because
two
creation
stories
is
one
of
the
worst
examples
of
a
difficulty
with
the
bible
were
formed
can
also
be
translated
had
been
formed
in
chapter
two
without
any
problems
so
the
text
does
not
demand
that
there
are
two
creation
stories
really
i
dont
get
it
genesis
first
says
that
god
created
the
earth
then
the
animals
then
humans
then
it
turns
around
and
says
that
humans
were
created
before
animals
how
can
you
escape
this
contradiction
