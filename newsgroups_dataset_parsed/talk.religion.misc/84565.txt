probably
not
but
then
i
dont
pack
heavy
weaponry
with
intent
to
use
it
please
cite
your
evidence
that
he
was
intending
to
use
it
well
he
would
be
pretty
stupid
not
to
i
mean
whats
the
use
of
spending
thousands
of
on
something
you
wont
use
sorry
if
im
stepping
on
the
toes
of
any
members
of
some
rifleassociation
here
rifles
bought
for
hunting
i
can
understand
rifles
bought
for
killing
people
or
for
just
keeping
i
cannot
just
for
the
record
i
am
myself
a
collector
of
medieval
armour
weaponry
and
i
dont
just
have
it
hanging
around
i
use
it
obviously
only
in
fencing
practice
with
friends
well
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
it
its
similar
to
collecting
coins
or
stamps
or
campaign
buttons
or
coke
bottles
or
juke
boxes
or
model
trains
or
just
about
anything
else
that
is
collected
and
just
about
everything
is
collected
in
all
cases
you
might
consider
it
something
of
an
aberration
i
mean
what
purpose
does
it
serve
not
much
really
its
just
a
hobby
the
collector
yearns
for
diversity
not
much
use
in
having
two
of
the
same
thing
except
for
tradingselling
it
historical
significance
this
was
the
thingy
used
by
soandso
technical
significance
this
is
the
only
one
that
does
suchandsuch
like
this
this
is
the
first
one
to
do
it
this
way
rarity
and
so
on
some
people
use
their
collections
other
people
do
not
as
you
state
you
use
your
collection
in
one
sense
this
diminishes
the
value
of
your
collection
as
the
items
suffer
wear
and
exposure
in
another
sense
it
can
enhance
your
own
enjoyment
of
your
collection
some
people
collect
firearms
that
they
do
not
use
other
people
use
some
or
all
of
the
firearms
they
collect
its
just
personal
preference
oops
personal
preference
i
guess
were
not
supposed
to
have
that
any
more
are
we
jbaker
