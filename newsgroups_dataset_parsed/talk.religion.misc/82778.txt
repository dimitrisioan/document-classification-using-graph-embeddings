im
curious
to
know
what
purpose
people
think
these
lists
serve
lists
like
this
seem
to
value
quantity
over
quality
an
argument
from
article
length
and
the
list
you
have
here
is
of
poorer
quality
than
most
i
agree
which
is
why
ive
asked
for
help
with
it
the
reason
im
working
on
this
list
is
because
ive
recently
had
one
too
many
christians
tell
me
the
bible
contains
no
contradictions
whatsoever
they
believe
that
its
true
and
that
it
describes
reality
perfectly
and
even
predicts
history
before
it
happens
before
i
can
carry
on
any
sort
of
meaningful
conversation
with
these
people
ive
got
to
show
them
with
concrete
evidence
that
the
bible
is
not
nearly
as
airtight
as
they
thought
i
hope
to
do
that
with
this
list
specifically
when
i
bring
up
the
fact
that
genesis
contains
two
contradictory
creation
stories
i
usually
get
blank
stares
or
flat
denials
ive
never
had
a
fundamentalist
acknowledge
that
there
are
indeed
two
different
accounts
of
creation
