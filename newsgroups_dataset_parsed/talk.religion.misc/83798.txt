RE
SILENCE
IS
CONCURANCE
FOR
THOSE
MISSING
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THIS
THRILLING
DISCUSSION
BETWEEN
JIM
AND
I
JIM
WROTE
THE
FOLLOWING
TO
ME
IN
EMAIL
AFTER
I
POINTED
OUT
THAT
HE
JIM
HAD
TAKEN
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
IN
TRM
ROBERT
WEISS
WRITES
A
PROMISE
FROM
PSALM
GEE
SINCE
YOU
WOULDNT
BE
AT
ALL
HYPOCRITICAL
YOU
MUST
BE
REALLY
BUSY
ARGUING
AGAINST
THESE
OUTOFCONTEXT
EXTRACTED
TRANSLATIONS
HE
DIRECTED
A
SIMILAR
ACCUSATION
OF
HYPOCRISY
AGAIN
BASED
ON
A
LACK
OF
RESPONSE
TO
AN
ARTICLE
BY
ROBERT
WEISS
TOWARD
STEPHEN
I
POINTED
OUT
THAT
I
DID
IN
FACT
AGREE
THAT
BOTH
ROBERT
WEISS
AND
JIM
MERITT
TOOK
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
HENCE
I
FIND
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHY
JIM
THINKS
I
AM
A
HYPOCRITE
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
I
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
REPLY
TO
EVERY
ARTICLE
ON
TRM
THAT
TAKES
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
I
ASKED
JIM
THE
FOLLOWING
SO
ACCORDING
TO
YOU
JIM
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
CRITICIZE
ONE
PERSON
FOR
TAKING
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
WITHOUT
BEING
A
HYPOCRITE
IS
TO
POST
A
RESPONSE
TO
EVERY
PERSON
ON
TRM
WHO
TAKES
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
JIM
REPLIED
BY
SAYING
DID
I
EITHER
ASK
OR
ASSERT
THAT
BUT
TODAY
WE
FIND
FOUR
ARTICLES
FROM
JIM
ONE
OF
WHICH
HAS
THE
SUBJECT
SILENCE
IS
CONCURRENCE
JAMES
MERITT
WRITES
IS
IT
NOT
THE
CASE
THAT
IN
THE
EYES
OF
THE
LAW
WHEN
SOMEONE
IS
AWARE
OF
SOMETHING
AND
HAS
THE
CAPABILITY
OF
TAKING
ACTION
AND
DOES
NOT
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
MAY
BE
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THAT
ACTION
WHICH
IS
OF
COURSE
A
COMPLETE
RED
HERRING
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
ISNT
A
CRIME
I
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
READ
EVERY
ARTICLE
ON
TRM
AND
IM
CERTAINLY
UNDER
NO
OBLIGATION
TO
REPLY
TO
THEM
ALL
DOES
SILENCE
IS
CONCURRENCE
IMPLY
THAT
JIM
THINKS
THAT
BECAUSE
I
DIDNT
RESPOND
TO
WEISS
ARTICLES
I
MUST
CONDONE
WEISS
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
JIM
DOESNT
WANT
TO
GIVE
A
DIRECT
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
READ
WHAT
HE
HAS
WRITTEN
AND
DECIDE
FOR
YOURSELF
BUT
BACK
TO
THE
CONTEXT
OF
MY
CONVERSATION
WITH
JIM
JIMS
NEXT
GAMBIT
WAS
TO
CLAIM
THAT
HE
WAS
USING
INDUCTIVE
LOGIC
WHEN
HE
CONCLUDED
THAT
I
WAS
BEING
A
HYPOCRITE
I
CHALLENGED
HIM
TO
PROVIDE
THE
DETAILS
OF
THAT
LOGIC
THAT
LED
HIM
TO
AN
INCORRECT
CONCLUSION
TODAY
WE
FIND
ANOTHER
OBSCURE
ARTICLE
POSTING
IT
TWICE
DIDNT
HELP
MAKE
IT
MORE
CLEAR
JIM
TITLED
INDUCTIVE
LOGIC
SCENARIO
A
WHITE
GOOSE
WADDLES
PAST
THE
DOOR
A
WHITE
GOOSE
WADDLES
PAST
THE
DOOR
A
WHITE
GOOSE
WADDLES
PAST
THE
DOOR
REPEAT
AN
UNCOUNTABLY
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
A
BLACK
GOOSE
WADDLES
PAST
THE
DOOR
AN
INDIVIDUAL
HITS
IT
WITH
AN
AXE
GIVEN
THAT
THE
POPULATION
OF
GEESE
IS
UNCOUNTABLY
LARGE
AND
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
CONFIDENCE
INTERVAL
FOR
THE
DECISION
IS
UNDETERMINED
UNDER
WHAT
CONDITIONS
COULD
A
DECISION
UPON
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
TOWARDS
WHITE
GEESE
BE
MADE
IF
ONLY
BLACK
GEESE
ARE
OBSERVED
TO
BE
AXED
IS
IT
NOT
A
VALID
QUESTION
TO
BE
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
DIFFERENT
BEHAVIOR
BETWEEN
BLACK
AND
WHITE
GEESE
MORE
RED
HERRINGS
COULD
JIM
MEAN
THAT
HE
HAS
READ
AN
UNCOUNTABLY
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
MY
ARTICLES
COULD
JIM
MEAN
THAT
BECAUSE
I
AXED
HIS
ARTICLES
BUT
NOT
WEISS
ARTICLES
HE
WANTS
TO
CONCLUDE
INDUCTIVELY
WELL
I
CANT
SEE
WHERE
HE
IS
GOING
WITH
THIS
BUT
I
CAN
HELP
HIM
WITH
HIS
INDUCTION
IVE
WRITTEN
ROUGHLY
ARTICLES
SINCE
JANUARY
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
THEM
ARE
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
FRANK
DECENSO
AND
OTHER
INERRANTISTS
WHERE
I
TAKE
THE
POSITION
THAT
THEY
ARE
MAKING
BAD
ARGUMENTS
SOME
ARE
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
JIM
MERITT
WHERE
I
TAKE
THE
POSITION
THAT
HE
IS
MAKING
BAD
ARGUMENTS
A
STRAW
MAN
ARGUMENT
EARLIER
AND
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
MORE
RECENTLY
THINK
HARD
ABOUT
THIS
JIM
SEE
THE
PATTERN
THINK
HARDER
RUN
IT
THROUGH
YOUR
INDUCTION
ENGINE
AND
SEE
WHAT
POPS
