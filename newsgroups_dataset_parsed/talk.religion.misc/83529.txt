MY
ONLINE
BIBLE
IS
ON
A
CD
BUT
I
DONT
OWN
A
CDROM
SYSTEM
FOR
THE
TIME
BEING
SO
I
CANT
SEARCH
FOR
THE
FAMOUS
CITE
WHERE
JESUS
EXPLICITLY
STATES
THAT
HE
DIDNT
WANT
TO
BREAK
EXISTING
JEWISH
LAWS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
TECHNICALLY
SPEAKING
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
USE
SATURDAY
AND
NOT
SUNDAY
AS
THEIR
HOLY
DAY
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
CONFORM
TO
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
JESUS
I
THINK
THE
PASSAGE
YOURE
LOOKING
FOR
IS
THE
FOLLOWING
MATTHEW
THINK
NOT
THAT
I
HAVE
COME
TO
ABOLISH
THE
LAW
AND
THE
PROPHETS
I
HAVE
COME
NOT
TO
ABOLISH
THEM
BUT
TO
FULFIL
THEM
MATTHEW
FOR
TRULY
I
SAY
TO
YOU
TILL
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
PASS
AWAY
NOT
AN
IOTA
NOT
A
DOT
WILL
PASS
FROM
THE
LAW
UNTIL
ALL
IS
ACCOMPLISHED
MATTHEW
WHOEVER
THEN
RELAXES
ONE
OF
THE
LEAST
OF
THESE
COMMANDMENTS
AND
TEACHES
MEN
SO
SHALL
BE
CALLED
LEAST
IN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
BUT
HE
WHO
DOES
THEM
AND
TEACHES
THEM
SHALL
BE
CALLED
GREAT
IN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
MATTHEW
FOR
I
TELL
YOU
UNLESS
YOUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
EXCEEDS
THAT
OF
THE
SCRIBES
AND
PHARISEES
YOU
WILL
NEVER
ENTER
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
THIS
THE
MOST
SERIOUS
IS
THAT
THE
LAW
WAS
REGARDED
BY
JEWS
AT
THE
TIME
AND
NOW
AS
BINDING
ON
JEWS
BUT
NOT
ON
GENTILES
THERE
ARE
RULES
THAT
WERE
BINDING
ON
ALL
HUMAN
BEINGS
THE
SOCALLED
NOACHIC
LAWS
BUT
THEY
ARE
QUITE
MINIMAL
THE
ISSUE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
HAD
TO
FACE
AFTER
JESUS
DEATH
WAS
WHAT
TO
DO
ABOUT
GENTILES
WHO
WANTED
TO
FOLLOW
CHRIST
THE
DECISION
NOT
TO
IMPOSE
THE
LAW
ON
THEM
DIDNT
SAY
THAT
THE
LAW
WAS
ABOLISHED
IT
SIMPLY
ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT
FACT
THAT
IT
DIDNT
APPLY
TO
GENTILES
THIS
IS
A
SIMPLE
ANSWER
WHICH
I
THINK
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYONE
CAN
AGREE
TO
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
ISSUE
IN
MORE
OR
LESS
THESE
TERMS
IS
RECORDED
IN
ACTS
HOWEVER
THERES
MORE
INVOLVED
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
A
FULL
PICTURE
OF
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
LAW
WE
HAVE
TO
COME
TO
GRIPS
WITH
PAULS
APPARENT
REJECTION
OF
THE
LAW
AND
HOW
THAT
RELATES
TO
JESUS
COMMENDATION
OF
THE
LAW
AT
LEAST
AS
I
READ
PAUL
HE
SAYS
THAT
THE
LAW
SERVES
A
PURPOSE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
IN
A
CERTAIN
SENSE
SUPERCEDED
AGAIN
THIS
ISSUE
ISNT
ONE
OF
THE
ABOLITION
OF
THE
LAW
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
HIS
DISCUSSION
PAUL
NOTES
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
UNDERSTOOD
THIS
WAY
AND
ASSURES
US
THAT
THATS
NOT
WHAT
HE
INTENDS
TO
SAY
RATHER
HE
SEES
THE
LAW
AS
PRIMARILY
BEING
PRESENT
TO
CONVICT
PEOPLE
OF
THEIR
SINFULNESS
BUT
ULTIMATELY
ITS
AN
IMPOSSIBLE
STANDARD
AND
ONE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
SUPERCEDED
BY
CHRIST
PAULS
COMMENTS
ARE
NOT
THE
WORLDS
CLEAREST
HERE
AND
NOT
EVERYONE
AGREES
WITH
MY
READING
BUT
THE
INTERESTING
THING
TO
NOTICE
IS
THAT
EVEN
THIS
RADICAL
POSITION
DOES
NOT
ENTAIL
AN
ABOLITION
OF
THE
LAW
IT
STILL
REMAINS
AS
AN
UNCOMPROMISING
STANDARD
FROM
WHICH
NOT
AN
IOTA
OR
DOT
MAY
BE
REMOVED
FOR
ITS
PURPOSE
OF
CONVICTING
OF
SIN
ITS
IMPORTANT
THAT
IT
NOT
BE
RELAXED
HOWEVER
FOR
CHRISTIANS
ITS
NOT
THE
END
ULTIMATELY
WE
LIVE
IN
FAITH
NOT
LAW
WHILE
THE
THEORETICAL
CATEGORIES
THEY
USE
ARE
RATHER
DIFFERENT
IN
THE
END
I
THINK
JESUS
AND
PAUL
COME
TO
A
RATHER
SIMILAR
CONCLUSION
THE
QUOTED
PASSAGE
FROM
MAT
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
REST
OF
THE
SERMON
ON
THE
MOUNT
WHERE
JESUS
SHOWS
US
HOW
HE
INTERPRETS
THE
LAW
THE
NOT
AN
IOTA
OR
DOT
WOULD
SUGGEST
A
RATHER
LITERAL
READING
BUT
IN
FACT
THATS
NOT
JESUS
APPROACH
JESUS
INTERPRETATIONS
EMPHASIZE
THE
INTENT
OF
THE
LAW
AND
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THE
CEREMONIAL
DETAILS
INDEED
HE
IS
WELL
KNOWN
FOR
TAKING
A
RATHER
FREE
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
THE
SABBATH
AND
KOSHER
LAWS
SOME
SCHOLARS
CLAIM
THAT
MAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
TAKEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
CENT
JEWISH
DISCUSSIONS
JESUS
ACCUSES
HIS
OPPONENTS
OF
CARING
ABOUT
GIVING
A
TENTH
OF
EVEN
THE
MOST
MINOR
HERBS
BUT
NEGLECTING
THE
THINGS
THAT
REALLY
MATTER
JUSTICE
MERCY
AND
FAITH
AND
CARING
ABOUT
HOW
CUPS
AND
PLATES
ARE
CLEANED
BUT
NOT
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
INSIDE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
USE
THEM
ARE
FULL
OF
EXTORTION
AND
RAPACITY
MAT
THIS
AND
THE
DISCUSSION
LATER
IN
MAT
SUGGEST
THAT
JESUS
HAS
A
VERY
SPECIFIC
VIEW
OF
THE
LAW
IN
MIND
AND
THAT
WHEN
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
MAINTAINING
THE
LAW
IN
ITS
FULL
STRENGTH
HE
IS
THINKING
OF
THESE
ASPECTS
OF
IT
PAULS
CONCLUSION
IS
SIMILAR
WHILE
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LAW
BEING
SUPERCEDED
ALL
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
HE
GIVES
INVOLVE
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
SUCH
AS
CIRCUMCISION
AND
THE
SABBATH
HE
IS
QUITE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
MAINTAINING
MORAL
STANDARDS
THE
NET
RESULT
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
WHEN
PAUL
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LAW
BEING
SUPERCEDED
AND
JESUS
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LAW
BEING
MAINTAINED
I
BELIEVE
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
DIFFERENT
ASPECTS
OF
THE
LAW
PAUL
IS
EMBROILED
IN
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
CIRCUMCISION
AS
IS
NATURAL
IN
LETTERS
RESPONDING
TO
SPECIFIC
SITUATIONS
HES
LOOKING
AT
THE
ASPECT
OF
THE
LAW
THAT
IS
CURRENTLY
CAUSING
TROUBLE
THE
LAW
AS
SPECIFICALLY
JEWISH
CEREMONIES
HE
CERTAINLY
DOES
NOT
INTEND
TO
ABOLISH
DIVINE
STANDARDS
OF
CONDUCT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WHEN
JESUS
COMMENDS
THE
LAW
HE
SEEMS
TO
BE
TALKING
THE
LAW
IN
ITS
BROADEST
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
MORALS
AND
HUMAN
RELATIONSHIPS
AND
DEEMPHASIZING
THOSE
ASPECTS
THAT
WERE
LATER
TO
GIVE
PAUL
SO
MUCH
TROUBLE
ITS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
PEOPLE
USE
THE
SAME
TERMS
IN
DIFFERENT
WAYS
BUT
WE
SHOULD
BE
FAMILIAR
WITH
THAT
FROM
CURRENT
CONFLICTS
LOOK
AT
THE
WAY
TERMS
LIKE
FAMILY
VALUES
TAKE
ON
SPECIAL
MEANING
FROM
THE
CURRENT
CONTEXT
IMAGINE
SOME
POOR
HISTORIAN
OF
THE
FUTURE
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
FAMILY
VALUES
SHOULD
BE
USED
AS
A
CODE
WORD
FOR
OPPOSITION
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
ONE
SPECIFIC
PERIOD
IN
THE
US
I
THINK
LAW
HAD
TAKEN
ON
A
SIMILAR
ROLE
IN
THE
ARGUMENTS
PAUL
WAS
INVOLVED
IN
PAUL
WAS
CLEARLY
NOT
REJECTING
ALL
OF
THE
JEWISH
VALUES
THAT
GO
ALONG
WITH
THE
TERM
LAW
ANY
MORE
THAN
PEOPLE
WHO
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
FAMILY
VALUES
MOVEMENT
ARE
REALLY
OPPOSED
TO
FAMILY
VALUES
