if
one
is
paying
for
a
private
health
insurance
plan
and
does
not
want
abortion
coverage
there
is
no
reason
for
that
person
to
be
complelled
to
pay
for
it
just
as
one
should
not
be
compelled
to
pay
for
lipposuction
coverage
if
one
doesnt
want
that
kind
of
coverage
you
appear
to
be
stunningly
ignorant
of
the
underlying
concept
of
health
insurance
are
you
any
less
stunningly
ignorant
have
you
ever
heard
of
life
insurance
premiums
some
companies
give
in
which
nonsmokers
are
charged
much
smaller
premiums
than
smokers
not
to
mention
auto
insurance
being
much
cheaper
for
women
under
than
for
men
under
because
women
on
the
average
drive
more
carefully
than
most
menin
fact
almost
as
carefully
as
i
did
before
i
was
as
many
people
have
mentioned
there
is
no
reason
why
insurers
could
not
offer
a
contract
without
abortion
services
for
a
different
premium
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
guarantee
that
this
premium
would
be
lower
for
those
who
chose
this
type
of
contract
although
you
are
removing
one
service
that
may
have
feedbacks
into
other
types
of
covered
care
which
results
in
a
net
increase
in
actuarial
costs
for
an
illustrative
example
in
the
opposite
direction
it
may
be
possible
to
add
services
to
an
insurance
contract
and
reduce
the
premium
if
you
add
preventative
services
and
this
reduces
acute
care
use
then
the
total
premium
may
fall
these
words
and
thoughts
are
my
own
i
am
not
bound
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
word
of
any
master
where
the
storm
carries
me
i
put
into
port
and
make
d
shea
psu
myself
at
home
