please
explain
how
koresh
was
defending
himself
from
those
children
who
burned
who
ever
said
he
was
what
is
obvious
is
that
he
was
defending
himself
and
his
followers
from
the
government
whether
you
think
he
was
right
or
wrong
in
this
is
another
question
if
he
was
right
then
he
had
the
moral
right
to
kill
those

the
killing
of
the
atf
agents
is
a
separate
issue
my
point
is
that
many
children
died
because
of
koresh
defending
himself
did
he
have
what
you
call
the
moral
right
to
keep
those
children
in
a
dangerous
enviroment
in
order
to
defend
himself
