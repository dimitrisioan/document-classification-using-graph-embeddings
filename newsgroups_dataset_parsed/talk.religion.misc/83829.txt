and
i
maintain
some
people
do
not
want
to
enter
into
the
light
and
the
knowledge
that
they
alone
are
their
own
masters
because
they
fear
it
they
are
too
afraid
of
having
to
face
the
world
on
their
own
terms
are
you
your
own
master
do
you
have
any
habits
that
you
cannot
break
if
i
have
a
habit
that
i
really
want
to
break
and
i
am
willing
to
make
whatever
sacrifice
i
need
to
make
to
break
it
then
i
do
so
there
have
been
bad
habits
of
mine
that
ive
decided
to
put
forth
the
effort
to
break
and
ive
done
so
there
have
been
other
bad
habits
that
ive
decided
are
not
worth
the
effort
to
break
its
my
choice
either
way
i
am
my
own
master
i
choose
what
i
want
to
do
i
weigh
the
benefits
of
my
actions
against
their
consequences
and
i
use
my
experience
to
help
me
deal
with
the
unexpected
which
in
turn
make
me
more
experienced
i
dont
always
succeed
but
i
never
fail
either
i
learn
do
you
have
any
habits
you
cant
break
why
not
for
one
you
seem
unable
to
master
your
lack
of
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
the
bible
i
have
arrived
at
my
own
understanding
of
christianity
just
as
youve
probably
arrived
at
your
own
understanding
of
islam
that
is
most
likely
very
different
from
the
way
a
moslem
thinks
of
his
religion
are
you
unable
to
master
your
lack
of
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
the
quran
if
thats
different
then
how
is
it
different
from
what
you
accuse
me
of
can
i
accuse
you
of
having
no
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
atheism
how
about
sexual
sins
gotta
any
of
those
secret
desires
in
your
head
that
you
harbor
but
can
get
control
of
do
you
dehumanize
women
when
they
walk
past
you
do
you
degrade
them
to
a
sex
object
in
your
head
of
course
not
thats
disgusting
for
centuries
religions
have
been
discriminating
on
sex
and
treating
women
as
secondclass
humans
thats
one
of
the
reasons
i
renounced
my
christianity
do
you
insult
people
unknowingly
then
regret
it
later
yet
do
it
again
the
next
time
opportunity
presents
itself
no
i
dont
insult
people
period
its
not
in
my
nature
and
its
not
something
that
i
want
to
do
either
are
you
truly
the
master
of
yourself
not
yet
but
my
life
is
the
ground
i
use
to
practice
on
the
fun
is
in
the
getting
there
i
have
admitted
that
i
am
not
the
master
of
my
thought
life
at
all
times
that
i
sometimes
say
things
i
do
want
to
say
and
then
repeat
my
mistake
unwantingly
i
have
admitted
to
myself
that
i
cannot
control
every
aspect
of
my
being
there
are
times
i
know
i
shouldnt
say
something
but
then
say
it
anyway
there
are
times
i
simply
forget
a
lesson
i
in
fact
am
not
my
own
master
we
dont
start
out
perfect
weve
got
to
strive
to
be
something
better
i
know
my
shortcomings
and
i
know
my
strengths
and
i
live
my
life
according
to
the
decisions
i
make
and
i
am
content
to
abide
with
the
consequences
of
my
decisions
as
easily
as
ill
accept
the
praise
for
them
there
have
been
times
in
my
life
when
ive
made
mistakes
yes
i
try
to
never
make
the
same
mistake
twice
i
need
help
jesus
promised
me
this
help
and
i
took
him
up
on
his
offer
i
have
willfully
let
jesus
be
my
master
because
jesus
knows
what
is
better
for
me
than
i
myself
do
i
regard
christ
as
a
myth
i
feel
that
there
are
far
too
many
people
offering
far
too
many
interpretations
of
what
he
supposedly
said
and
did
the
only
person
who
can
really
judge
me
is
me
i
choose
the
roads
i
travel
and
i
decide
whether
or
not
i
want
to
reach
the
end
of
any
given
road
or
turn
back
and
as
long
as
i
dont
always
turn
back
theres
no
shame
in
it
when
i
need
help
i
seek
out
my
friends
do
you
see
my
point
i
think
youre
the
one
under
the
rock
and
im
getting
a
great
tan
out
here
in
the
sunlight
my
life
has
improved
immesurably
since
i
abandoned
theism
come
and
join
me
it
will
be
a
difficult
trip
at
first
until
you
build
up
your
muscles
for
the
long
hike
but
its
well
worth
it
then
i
guess
ignorance
is
bliss
for
you
because
brian
you
enjoy
not
having
a
clue
about
the
bible
and
you
dont
have
a
clue
about
what
im
saying
either
open
your
eyes
and
see
open
your
ears
and
listen
im
not
just
spouting
off
empty
words
this
is
my
life
this
is
what
gives
me
meaning
dont
you
see
im
not
going
to
accept
anything
that
i
cant
witness
with
my
own
eyes
or
experience
with
my
own
senses
especially
not
something
as
megapowerful
as
what
youre
trying
to
get
me
to
accept
surely
if
you
believe
in
it
this
strongly
you
must
have
a
good
reason
to
dont
you
can
you
witness
motherly
love
with
your
senses
how
does
caring
and
concern
for
you
register
with
your
senses
if
nothing
registers
to
you
other
than
what
you
can
see
taste
smell
hear
and
touch
then
you
better
become
a
vulcan
and
fast
you
better
get
rid
of
your
emotions
huh
youre
going
way
off
the
track
here
i
say
my
mother
loves
me
how
do
i
know
you
ask
i
can
point
to
definite
things
shes
done
for
me
and
i
can
even
just
bring
her
to
you
so
you
can
ask
her
facetoface
you
say
your
deity
loves
you
how
do
you
know
i
ask
you
cant
even
convince
me
that
it
exists
my
god
says
that
you
will
not
cease
existing
you
have
life
forever
you
can
choose
to
either
live
it
in
hell
in
eternal
torment
where
there
is
no
communication
whatsoever
or
can
choose
to
live
it
in
paradise
with
god
that
is
what
my
god
says
and
that
was
the
issue
your
madeup
theism
is
what
it
ismade
up
its
wishful
thinking
if
any
god
dangles
heaven
before
me
like
a
carrot
promising
untold
pleasures
to
me
if
ill
only
suspend
my
disbelief
and
ignore
my
rationality
for
just
this
once
then
i
would
choose
hell
i
can
not
lie
to
myself
to
placate
another
being
no
matter
how
powerful
it
is
note
also
that
there
are
several
gods
trying
to
lure
me
this
way
yahweh
allah
zeus
odin
ra
please
give
me
a
solid
reason
to
choose
one
of
them
over
the
others
description

hee
hee
why
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
thats
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybody
else
any
good
either
because
everyone
dies
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
leading
a
good
life
is
meaningless
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
that
paragraph
demonstrates
that
you
havent
listened
to
a
single
word
ive
said
have
you
ever
gone
to
an
amusement
park
why
i
mean
after
a
few
hours
it
closes
and
nothings
different
except
that
youre
a
few
dollars
lighter
going
to
the
amusement
park
doesnt
do
you
any
good
at
all
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
the
answer
is
that
you
think
its
fun
you
play
the
skeeball
over
and
over
because
youd
like
to
get
better
at
it
even
though
youre
not
going
to
win
anything
better
than
a
stuffed
animal
even
if
you
blow
ten
dollars
on
it
you
ride
the
roller
coaster
because
its
an
thrilling
experience
even
though
because
it
scares
the
dickens
out
of
you
in
the
same
way
i
think
life
is
fun
and
i
dont
intend
to
leave
the
amusement
park
of
life
until
they
close
down
for
the
night
d
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
has
the
resurrection
sunk
in
jesus
is
alive
jesus
is
not
dead
so
you
and
your
holy
book
say
by
the
same
token
therefore
santa
claus
delivers
toys
every
xmas
dont
you
see
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
what
you
say
is
true
please
give
me
some
reason
that
i
cant
similarly
apply
to
santa
claus
forget
the
bible
for
a
minute
forget
quoting
verses
forget
about
who
said
what
about
this
or
that
show
me
picture
just
you
and
me
and
a
wide
open
hilltop
and
convince
me
that
youre
right
forget
that
i
am
a
person
forget
that
i
know
how
to
type
forget
that
i
know
how
to
put
a
sentence
together
forget
that
i
know
how
to
send
email
forget
my
existence
proove
to
me
that
i
exist
i
cant
do
it
because
your
existence
means
nothing
more
to
me
than
just
your
communications
over
the
net
you
have
no
more
bearing
on
nor
importance
in
my
life
than
that
remove
it
and
you
will
cease
to
be
significant
to
me
are
you
thereby
inferring
that
your
deity
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
verses
in
a
book
and
cannot
be
supported
without
invoking
them
or
do
you
mean
that
the
existence
of
your
deity
and
in
fact
any
other
deity
that
can
be
written
about
is
as
real
as
your
own
existence
why
do
you
believe
what
you
believe
