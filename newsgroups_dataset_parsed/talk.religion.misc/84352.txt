recently
ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
dear
joakim
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
these
are
excellent
questions
but
that
by
asking
you
will
find
as
many
different
explanations
as
there
are
respondents
as
a
latterday
saint
i
believe
that
all
of
us
you
me
etc
lived
once
as
spiritchildren
of
god
the
father
hebrews
in
the
premortal
existance
in
order
to
continue
our
eternal
progression
an
earthly
probationary
time
was
required
to
live
by
faith
not
by
sight
to
choose
good
over
evil
and
to
prepare
ourselves
in
all
things
to
become
worthy
of
a
higher
order
of
existance
we
believe
that
all
of
gods
spiritoffspring
were
once
assembled
to
discuss
the
specifics
of
this
earthly
sojourn
onethird
chose
for
lucifers
plan
most
followed
the
firstborn
the
premortal
jesus
christ
lucifers
aspirations
i
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
god
isaiah
etc
resulted
into
the
rebellion
of
his
followers
against
the
firstborn
and
those
who
followed
him
resulting
in
the
casting
out
of
lucifer
who
became
satan
the
father
of
lies
and
onethird
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
and
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth
revelation
as
demons
evil
spirits
to
get
back
on
our
choice
to
be
born
on
this
earth
and
to
be
subject
to
god
and
his
plan
for
good
or
bad
based
upon
our
obedience
and
choices
we
made
that
choice
individually
god
speaking
to
job
where
wast
thou
when
i
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
when
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
job
we
lost
the
knowledge
of
our
premortal
existance
the
veil
of
forgetful
ness
somewhere
in
psalms
in
order
to
live
by
faith
not
by
sight
you
may
not
accept
this
scenario
neither
do
quite
a
few
who
rely
on
the
bible
alone
which
offers
only
fragmentary
insights
into
this
particular
aspect
of
our
existence
as
individuals
as
sons
and
daughters
of
god
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
all
christians
by
definition
are
a
flock
of
sheep
following
the
shepherd
as
they
understand
him
but
in
any
event
not
all
christians
believe
in
the
same
theology
such
as
the
one
latterday
saints
believe
in
they
will
cry
heresy
and
other
accusations
of
perverting
the
doctrines
of
the
bible
while
they
themselves
believe
in
a
myriad
of
interpretations
as
found
in
their
catechisms
and
various
doityourself
biblestudy
manuals
as
for
me
i
have
a
personal
conviction
that
the
preexistance
scenario
as
explained
above
is
most
in
harmony
with
biblical
doctrine
some
dead
sea
scroll
books
the
pseudographion
other
jewish
sources
and
last
but
not
least
modernday
revelation
on
the
subject
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
sarcasm
i
mean
it
how
should
one
deal
with
a
man
who
is
convinced
that
he
is
acting
according
to
gods
will
and
who
there
jokke
fore
believes
that
he
is
doing
you
a
favour
by
stabbing
you
in
the
back
