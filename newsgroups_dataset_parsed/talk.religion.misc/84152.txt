so
are
you
happy
now
when
people
including
innocent
kids
died
today
no
and
im
especially
unhappy
that
these
people
died
in
an
assault
on
private
property
with
government
armored
vehicles
i
am
also
unhappy
or
actually
very
suspicious
that
the
fbi
was
dismissing
out
of
hand
any
chances
that
they
might
have
accidentally
set
the
blaze
themselves
i
mean
i
guess
we
are
just
supposed
to
believe
that
ramming
modified
tanks
into
the
walls
of
a
building
and
injecting
toxic
gases
into
the
building
are
just
routine
procedures
no
way
anything
could
go
wrong
legalize
freedom
