let
me
begin
by
saying
i
think
this
is
the
worlds
first
religion
to
use
the
net
as
its
major
recruitment
medium
therefore
even
if
this
religion
does
not
take
off
its
founding
members
will
be
very
important
historically
as
this
method
of
soliciting
membership
will
eventually
become
common
so
what
is
kibology
chopped
liver
kibo
himself
summed
it
up
by
saying
kibology
is
not
just
a
religion
it
is
also
a
candy
mint
and
a
floor
wax
i
personally
think
that
it
is
more
like
spam
clear
you
really
should
check
out
altreligionkibology
as
kibos
religion
is
slightly
older
than
yours
makes
more
sense
and
has
more
slack
yes
why
send
money
to
when
kibo
will
pay
you
to
worship
him
funny
he
doesnt
seem
to
have
paid
me
live
from
capitaland
heart
of
the
