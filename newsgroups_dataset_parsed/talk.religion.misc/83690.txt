APOLOGY
TO
JIM
MERITT
WAS
SILENCE
IS
CONCURANCE
JAMES
MERITT
WRITES
SO
STOP
DODGING
THE
QUESTION
WHAT
IS
HYPOCRITICAL
ABOUT
MY
CRITICIZING
BAD
ARGUMENTS
GIVEN
THAT
I
DO
THIS
BOTH
WHEN
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
CONCLUSION
AND
WHEN
I
DISAGREE
WITH
THE
CONCLUSION
YOU
ARE
THE
ONE
WHO
HAS
CLAIMED
TO
POSSESS
THE
FRUITS
OF
PRECOGNITION
TELEPATHY
AND
TELEMPATHY
DIVINE
IT
YOURSELF
ANOTHER
DODGE
OH
WELL
IM
NO
MATCH
FOR
YOUR
AMAZING
REPERTOIRE
OF
RED
HERRINGS
AND
SMOKE
SCREENS
YOU
ASKED
FOR
AN
APOLOGY
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
APOLOGIZE
FOR
POINTING
OUT
THAT
YOUR
STRAWMAN
ARGUMENT
WAS
A
STRAWMAN
ARGUMENT
NOR
FOR
SAYING
THAT
YOUR
LIST
OF
BIBLE
CONTRADICTIONS
SHOWS
SUCH
LOW
STANDARDS
OF
SCHOLARSHIP
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
AN
EMBARRASSMENT
TO
ANTIINERRANTISTS
JUST
AS
JOSH
MCDOWELL
SHOULD
BE
AN
EMBARRASSMENT
TO
THE
FUNDIES
NOR
FOR
OBJECTING
VARIOUS
TIMES
TO
YOUR
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
NOR
FOR
POINTING
OUT
THAT
THEY
DO
IT
TOO
IS
NOT
AN
EXCUSE
NOR
FOR
CALLING
YOUR
RED
HERRINGS
AND
SMOKE
SCREENS
WHAT
THEY
ARE
IM
STILL
NOT
SURE
WHY
YOU
THINK
IM
A
HYPOCRITE
ITS
TRUE
THAT
I
HAVENT
RESPONDED
TO
ANY
OF
ROBERT
WEISS
ARTICLES
WHICH
MAY
BE
DUE
IN
PART
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
I
ALMOST
NEVER
READ
HIS
ARTICLES
BUT
I
HAVE
RESPONDED
TO
BOTH
YOU
AND
FRANK
DECENSO
A
FUNDIEINERRANTIST
BOTH
YOU
AND
FRANK
HAVE
TAKEN
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
AND
IVE
OBJECTED
TO
BOTH
OF
YOU
DOING
SO
IVE
CRITICIZED
BAD
ARGUMENTS
BOTH
WHEN
THEY
WERE
YOURS
AND
I
AGREED
WITH
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
NOT
INERRANT
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
FRANKS
AND
I
DISAGREED
WITH
THE
CONCLUSION
IVE
CRITICIZED
BOTH
YOU
AND
FRANK
FOR
EVADING
QUESTIONS
AND
FOR
TRYING
TO
EXPLAIN
ME
AWAY
WITHOUT
ADDRESSING
THE
OBJECTIONS
I
RAISE
YOU
BY
ACCUSING
ME
OF
BEING
HYPOCRITICAL
AND
IRRATIONAL
FRANK
BY
ACCUSING
ME
OF
BEING
MOTIVATED
BY
A
DESIRE
TO
ATTACK
THE
BIBLE
I
DONT
SEE
THAT
ANY
OF
THIS
IS
HYPOCRITICAL
NOR
DO
I
APOLOGIZE
FOR
IT
I
DO
APOLOGIZE
HOWEVER
FOR
HAVING
OFFENDED
YOU
IN
ANY
OTHER
WAY
HAPPY
NOW
