I
AM
NOT
ACCUSING
YOU
OF
EVIL
THINGS
JESUS
IS
ACCUSING
YOU
AND
IT
IS
NOT
ONLY
YOU
THAT
HE
IS
ACCUSING
HE
IS
ACCUSING
EVERYONE
ME
YOU
AND
EVERYONE
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
GUILTY
WHETHER
ONE
SEES
THE
LIGHT
OR
DOES
NOT
SEEN
THE
LIGHT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
WHETHER
WE
DO
EVIL
THINGS
WE
DO
THEM
REGARDLESS
HMM
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CORE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
FEEL
GUILTY
AND
THEN
THERES
THIS
SINGLE
PERSONALITY
THAT
WILL
SAVE
YOU
FROM
THIS
UNIVERSAL
GUILT
FEELING
BRIAN
I
WILL
TELL
YOU
A
SECRET
I
DONT
FEEL
GUILTY
AT
ALL
I
DO
MISTAKES
AND
I
REGRET
THEM
HOWEVER
IVE
NEVER
HAD
THIS
HUGE
GUILT
FEELING
HANGING
OVER
MY
SHOULDER
IF
THINGS
HAPPEN
WRONG
I
WILL
TRY
TO
LEARN
FROM
THE
MISTAKES
AND
GO
ON
THIS
ALL
IS
A
VERY
CLEAR
INDICATION
THAT
YOU
NEED
A
CERTAIN
PERSONALITY
TYPE
IN
ORDER
TO
BELIEVE
AND
ADJUST
TO
CERTAIN
RELIGIOUS
DOCTRINES
AND
IF
YOUR
PERSONALITY
TYPE
IS
OPPOSITE
THEN
YOU
ARE
NOT
THAT
EASILY
ATTACHED
TO
A
CERTAIN
WORLD
VIEW
SYSTEM
SO
DO
YOU
SEE
JESUSS
POINT
CHRISTIANS
ARE
NOT
PERFECT
NONCHRISTIANS
ARE
NOT
PERFECT
NONCHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
COME
INTO
THE
LIGHT
OF
JESUS
BECAUSE
THEY
WILL
SEE
ALL
THE
PROBLEMS
IN
THEIR
LIVES
AND
THEY
WILL
NOT
LIKE
THE
SIGHT
IT
IS
AN
UGLY
THING
TO
SEE
HOW
FAR
WE
HAVE
FALLEN
FROM
JESUSS
PERSPECTIVE
DO
YOU
THINK
YOU
WANT
TO
KNOW
HOW
REALLY
IGNORANT
YOU
ARE
DO
YOU
THINK
BRIAN
KENDIG
WANTS
TO
KNOW
DO
YOU
THINK
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
EGO
VERSES
THE
TRUTH
WHICH
DO
YOU
CHOOSE
ALL
I
KNOW
IS
THAT
I
DONT
KNOW
EVERYTHING
AND
FRANKLY
SPEAKING
I
DONT
CARE
LIFE
IS
FUN
ANYWAY
I
RECOGNIZE
THAT
IM
NOT
PERFECT
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
HINDER
ME
FROM
HAVE
A
HEALTHY
AND
INSPIRING
LIFE
THERE
ARE
HUMANS
THAT
SUBSCRIBE
TO
THE
SAME
NOTION
THE
NICE
THING
IS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
FINALLY
SHAKE
OFF
THIS
HUGE
BURDEN
THE
SHOULDERS
FEEL
FAR
