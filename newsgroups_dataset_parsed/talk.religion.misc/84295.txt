DELETED
IF
I
MAKE
A
STATEMENT
THAT
GOD
EXISTS
LOVES
ME
ETC
BUT
IN
NO
WAY
INSIST
THAT
YOU
BELIEVE
IT
DOES
THAT
PLACE
A
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
UPON
ME
IF
YOU
INSIST
THAT
GOD
DOESNT
EXIST
DOES
THAT
PLACE
A
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
UPON
YOU
I
GIVE
NO
PROOFS
I
ONLY
GIVE
TESTIMONY
TO
MY
BELIEFS
I
WILL
RESPOND
TO
PROOFS
THAT
YOU
ATTEMPT
TO
DISPROVE
MY
BELIEFS
IF
YOU
SAY
X
STATEMENT
AND
GIVE
IT
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
FACT
I
WILL
RESPOND
BY
ASKING
YOU
WHY
YOU
ARENT
OBLIGATED
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
BUT
IF
YOUR
INTENT
IS
TO
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
X
STATEMENT
IS
TRUE
THEN
YES
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IS
UPON
YOU
IF
WHAT
WAS
BEING
DISCUSSED
COULD
BE
ESTABLISHED
OR
DISPROVEN
BY
EXPERIMENT
AND
OBSERVATION
THEN
I
WOULD
AGREE
WITH
YOU
CHRIS
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
WOULD
BELONG
TO
BILL
BUT
THE
SOURCE
DOCUMENT
FOR
CHRISTIANITY
THE
BIBLE
SIMPLY
ASSUMES
GOD
EXISTS
AND
MAKES
IT
CLEAR
TO
US
CALVINISTS
ANYWAY
THAT
WHEN
A
PERSON
IS
IN
FELLOWSHIP
WITH
GOD
IT
IS
BECAUSE
GOD
HAS
TAKEN
THE
INITIATIVE
IN
REVEALING
HIMSELF
TO
THAT
PERSON
SO
FROM
A
CHRISTIAN
POINT
OF
VIEW
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
BELONGS
TO
GOD
BILL
IS
BEING
CONSISTENT
WITH
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
IN
RELATING
HIS
OWN
EXPERIENCE
WITH
GOD
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
AN
ERROR
ON
HIS
PART
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DIRECT
CAUSAL
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
HIS
TESTIMONY
AND
SOMEONE
ELSE
BECOMING
CONVINCED
THAT
GOD
EXISTS
AND
THAT
HE
NEEDS
TO
BE
RECONCILED
TO
GOD
IF
YOU
ARE
MERELY
GIVING
TESTIMONY
TO
YOUR
BELIEFS
THEN
YOU
ARE
AN
EGOTIST
PLEASE
EXCUSE
ME
IF
I
MISSED
AN
EARLIER
PART
OF
THIS
THREAD
IN
WHICH
BILL
CAME
ACROSS
LIKE
AN
EGOTIST
WHAT
I
SAW
WAS
SIMPLY
OBEDIENCE
TO
THE
SCRIPTURAL
COMMAND
TO
ALWAYS
BE
READY
TO
GIVE
A
REASON
FOR
THE
JOY
THAT
IS
IN
YOU
