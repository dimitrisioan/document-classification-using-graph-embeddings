EVOLUTION
AS
I
HAVE
SAID
BEFORE
IS
THEORY
AND
FACT
IT
IS
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
OF
EACH
AS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ATOMS
AND
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GRAVITY
IF
YOU
ACCEPT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ATOMS
AND
GRAVITY
AS
FACT
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
ALSO
ACCEPT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
EVOLUTION
AS
FACT
ANDY
I
DONT
ACCEPT
ATOMS
OR
GRAVITY
AS
FACT
EITHER
THEY
ARE
EXTREMELY
USEFUL
MATHEMATICAL
MODELS
TO
DESCRIBE
PHYSICAL
OBSERVATIONS
WE
CAN
MAKE
OTHER
POSTERS
HAVE
APTLY
EXPLAINED
THE
ATOMIC
MODEL
GRAVITY
TOO
IS
VERY
MUCH
A
THEORY
NO
GRAVITY
WAVES
HAVE
EVEN
BEEN
DETECTED
BUT
WE
HAVE
A
VERY
USEFUL
MODEL
THAT
DESCRIBES
MUCH
OF
THE
BEHAVIOR
ON
OBJECTS
BY
THIS
THING
WE
CALL
GRAVITY
GRAVITY
HOWEVER
IS
NOT
A
FACT
IT
IS
A
THEORETICAL
MODEL
USED
TO
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
OBJECTS
BEHAVE
IN
OUR
PHYSICAL
ENVIRONMENT
NEWTON
THOUGHT
GRAVITY
WAS
A
SIMPLE
VECTOR
FORCE
EINSTEIN
A
WAVE
BOTH
ARE
VERY
USEFUL
MODELS
THAT
HAVE
NO
RELIGIOUS
OVERTONES
OR
REQUIREMENTS
OF
FAITH
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
YOU
WANT
TO
DEMAND
THAT
IT
IS
A
FACTUAL
PHYSICAL
ENTITY
DESCRIBED
EXACTLY
THE
WAY
THE
THEORY
NOW
FORMULATED
TALKS
ABOUT
IT
THAT
TAKES
A
GREAT
LEAP
OF
FAITH
WHICH
OF
COURSE
IS
WHAT
RELIGION
TAKES
EVOLUTION
IS
NO

HERES
AN

NEXT

YOU
ARE
IN
THE
BARNYARD
TAKE
YOUR
MODEL
AND
HOLD
IT
DIRECTLY
ABOVE
A
FRESH
COWPIE
THEN
RELEASE
THE
MODEL
YOU
WILL
OBSERVE
THAT
ON
ITS
OWN
YOUR

WILL
ASSUME
A
TRAJECTORY
