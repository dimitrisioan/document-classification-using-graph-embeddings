MA
WRITES
I
JUST
STARTED
READING
THIS
NEWSGROUP
AND
HAVENT
BEEN
FOLLOWING
THE
THREAD
IM
JUST
CURIOUS
HOW
DID
THIS
THREAD
GET
STARTED
WITH
ALBERT
SABIN
AND
CHANGED
INTO
SOMETHING
ELSE
WHAT
WAS
IT
ABOUT
SABIN
THAT
INITIATED
A
RELIGIOUS
DISCUSSION
COLIN
ITS
JUST
VARIATION
WITHIN
A
THREAD
THE
VARIATION
AT
TIMES
HAS
BEEN
SO
GREAT
THAT
SPECIATION
HAS
OCCURRED
SO
ALBERT
SABIN
IS
THE
COMMON
ANCESTOR
OF
SEVERAL
THREADS
SOME
OF
WHICH
HAVE
THEMSELVES
SPECIATED
ON
A
SEPARATE
TOPIC
I
SUBSCRIBED
TO
TO
JUST
RECENTLY
ALBERT
SABIN
EXISTED
AT
THAT
TIME
SO
I
HAVE
NO
CLUE
AS
TO
ITS
ORIGINS
MAYBE
THE
ABIOGENESISTS
HAVE
AN
ANSWER
I
MIGHT
ALSO
POINT
OUT
THAT
EVOLUTION
IS
AIMLESS
THUS
WHY
ALBERT
SABIN
EVOLVED
INTO
A
RELIGIOUS
DISCUSSION
IS
PROBABLY
UNEXPLAINABLE
