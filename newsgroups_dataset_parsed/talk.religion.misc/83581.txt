WALTER
I
TRIED
SEVERAL
TIMES
IN
THE
PAST
TO
COMMUNICATE
WITH
YOU
AND
SUSAN
BUT
YOU
IGNORED
ME
AND
I
DONT
HONESTLY
BELIEVE
MY
LETTERS
WERE
MEAN
RATHER
I
THOUGHT
THEY
WERE
THOUGHTFUL
AND
COMPASSIONATE
BUT
I
SEE
NOW
WHAT
I
SHOULD
HAVE
SEEN
THEN
CALL
ME
NAIVE
I
GIVE
UP
ON
THIS
GROUP
AS
MY
LORD
ADVISED
THAT
IF
YOU
ARE
UNWELCOME
IN
A
CITY
THEN
BRUSH
THE
DUST
OF
YOUR
FEET
AND
GO
ON
IF
ANYONE
CARES
ABOUT
THE
TOPIC
THEY
WRITE
TO
ME
DIRECT
IF
NOT
WELL
MAY
GOD
BLESS
YOU
AS
WELL
BYE
TO
THIS
GROUP
PAX
