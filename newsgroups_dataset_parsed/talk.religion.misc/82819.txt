seriously
though
griffen
didnt
save
the
lives
of
children
and
he
did
destroy
the
life
of
a
man
so
on
the
most
superficial
of
levels
hes
scum
i
almost
agree
but
griffen
is
not
scum
scum
has
no
guilt
or
freedom
to
choose
anything
griffen
does
god
did
not
make
scum
when
he
made
griffen
he
made
a
precious
person
and
this
person
chose
to
do
wrong
the
same
goes
for
dr
gunn
but
if
you
are
to
examine
it
more
closely
griffen
would
have
preferred
that
these
children
were
born
yet
after
their
birth
did
griffen
have
any
assistance
to
offer
them
did
griffen
intend
to
support
them
educate
them
raise
them
up
to
be
useful
citizens
did
he
have
any
intent
whatsoever
to
help
these
children
after
birth
heres
the
real
problem
americans
have
become
so
insensitive
to
the
needs
of
others
and
so
completely
wrapped
up
in
themselves
that
they
cannot
see
straight
or
think
clearly
enough
to
make
even
the
slightest
and
most
obvious
moral
decisions
based
on
reality
if
a
man
abandons
a
woman
to
care
for
their
child
on
her
own
he
is
not
considered
to
be
a
very
respectable
or
decent
man
by
anyone
this
man
has
fled
his
responsibility
has
behaved
like
a
lazy
coward
and
has
turned
away
from
his
responsibility
to
his
wife
and
child
however
if
a
woman
decides
to
kill
her
unborn
child
to
release
her
burden
she
is
not
thought
of
in
the
same
way
when
the
man
abandons
the
woman
suffers
but
the
child
is
free
to
grow
up
and
live
a
happy
and
normal
life
when
the
woman
abandons
the
child
is
diced
or
killed
with
saline
or
vacuumed
out
and
the
man
has
no
choice
and
the
man
sometimes
suffers
so
badly
that
he
wishes
he
could
trade
places
with
his
child
ths
root
of
this
whole
problem
is
selfishnessthe
arrogance
that
says
my
feelings
and
desires
are
supreme
and
your
well
being
is
not
worth
dung
and
when
you
come
down
to
it
this
is
the
substance
of
what
hell
is
made
of
its
the
reason
a
loving
god
can
throw
selfish
people
to
the
devil
and
his
demons
for
all
of
eternity
let
any
one
of
us
unrepentant
into
heaven
and
well
ruin
it
the
first
chance
we
get
now
i
dont
really
know
the
answer
to
these
questions
but
ive
got
a
real
good
guess
and
its
probably
right
and
i
wouldnt
call
that
benevolent
either
it
is
a
move
in
the
right
direction
as
it
is
now
we
dont
see
our
responsibility
because
we
kill
it
and
get
it
out
of
sight
the
media
backs
us
completely
real
responsibility
does
not
sell
the
only
responsibility
that
sells
in
the
marketplace
is
that
which
is
just
enough
to
make
us
feel
responsible
without
showing
anything
that
might
show
us
our
own
true
irresponsibility
we
want
to
feel
like
good
people
but
we
want
nothing
with
being
good
people
just
give
me
the
freedom
to
say
im
good
and
the
rest
of
the
world
can
burn
rape
and
kill
my
children
and
throw
my
parents
to
the
places
where
poor
old
folks
rot
until
theyre
dead
ill
hate
my
brother
and
sister
if
i
wish
and
ill
cheat
on
my
wife
or
husband
screw
the
government
because
it
screws
me
and
dont
talk
to
me
about
giving
to
the
church
because
church
people
are
all
a
bunch
of
money
grubbing
hypocrites
but
im
a
good
person
at
least
i
admit
what
i
do
at
least
i
love
myself
and
we
all
know
that
is
the
greatest
love
in
the
worldnot
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
brotherthat
sounds
too
christian
at
the
root
this
is
the
substance
of
what
hell
is
made
of
weve
become
a
self
indulgant
backslidden
society
no
longer
responsible
to
our
children
to
our
parents
to
our
families
to
our
government
or
to
our
god
this
is
the
root
behind
justification
of
every
evil
of
every
corruption
in
government
of
every
slanderous
remark
of
every
lie
and
of
every
murder
society
cannot
continue
to
live
like
this
long
it
will
have
to
destroy
itsself
soon
and
perhaps
in
the
end
that
will
be
the
biggest
blessing
this
world
can
hope
to
see
why
do
people
see
so
much
evil
in
trying
to
turn
this
situation
around
i
deplore
the
horrible
crime
of
child
murder
we
want
prevention
not
merely
punishment
we
must
reach
the
root
of
the
evil
it
is
practiced
by
those
whose
inmost
souls
revolt
from
the
dreadful
deed
no
mater
what
the
motive
love
of
ease
or
a
desire
to
save
from
suffering
the
unborn
innocent
the
woman
is
awfully
guilty
who
commits
the
deed
but
oh
thrice
guilty
is
he
who
drove
her
to
the
desperation
which
impelled
her
to
the
crime
