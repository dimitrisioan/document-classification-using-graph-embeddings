MORALITY

DAVID
BOLD
SAYS
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
BE
RUDE
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
YOUVE
GOT
HOLD
OF
THE
WRONG
END
OF
A
DIFFERENT
STICK
DAVID
I
HAD
A
LOOK
AT
YOUR
POSTING
AGAIN
AND
I
SEE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
I
WAS
SO
INTENT
ON
EXPLAINING
HOW
JUNG
THOUGHT
WE
COULD
BE
MORE
MORAL
THAN
GOD
THAT
I
OVERLOOKED
YOUR
MAIN
LINE
OF
THOUGHT
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
SAYING
THAT
GOD
BEING
UNKNOWABLE
HIS
MORALITY
IS
UNKNOWABLE
YEP
THATS
PRETTY
MUCH
IT
IM
NOT
A
JEW
BUT
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
JEWISH
WAY
OF
THINKING
HOWEVER
THE
JEWS
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
COVENANT
BETWEEN
YHWH
AND
THE
PATRIARCHS
ABRAHAM
AND
MOSES
IN
THIS
CASE
ESTABLISHES
A
MORAL
CODE
TO
FOLLOW
FOR
MANKIND
EVEN
THE
JEWS
COULD
NOT
DECIDE
WHERE
THE
BOUNDARIES
FALL
THOUGH
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
THE
SADDUCEES
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
TORAH
WAS
ALL
THAT
WAS
REQUIRED
WHEREAS
THE
PHARISEES
THE
ANCESTORS
OF
MODERN
JUDAISM
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
TORAH
WAS
AVAILABLE
FOR
INTERPRETATION
TO
LEAD
TO
AN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
REQUIRED
MORALITY
IN
ALL
ITS
NUANCES
TALMUD
THE
ESSENCE
OF
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
BIBLICAL
MORALITY
IS
AN
INTERFACE
BETWEEN
MAN
AND
YHWH
FOR
A
JEW
OR
CHRISTIAN
AND
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
INDICATE
ANYTHING
ABOUT
YHWH
OUTSIDE
OF
THAT
RELATIONSHIP
ALTHOUGH
ONE
CAN
SPECULATE
THE
FIRST
THING
THAT
COMES
TO
MIND
IS
THAT
MAN
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
CREATED
IN
HIS
IMAGE
SO
THERE
IS
AN
ARGUMENT
THAT
WE
ARE
COMMITTED
TO
WHATEVER
MORAL
CODE
HE
FOLLOWS
AS
PART
OF
TRYING
TO
LIVE
UP
TO
THAT
IMAGE
IF
WE
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
LIVE
BY
CHRISTS
EXAMPLE
YOU
WOULD
BE
HARD
PRESSED
TO
ARGUE
THAT
GOD
IS
A
DO
WHAT
I
SAY
NOT
WHAT
I
DO
KIND
OF
GUY
THE
TROUBLE
WITH
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
WE
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
WHAT
THE
CREATED
IN
HIS
IMAGE
MEANS
IVE
HEARD
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
OPINIONS
ON
THIS
AND
HAVE
STILL
NOT
COME
TO
ANY
CONCLUSION
THIS
RATHER
UPSETS
THE
APPLE
CART
IF
ONE
WANTS
TO
BASE
A
LIFE
SCRIPT
ON
THIS
SHAKY
FOUNDATION
TO
MIX
METAPHORS
UNASHAMEDLY
AS
TO
LIVING
BY
CHRISTS
EXAMPLE
WE
KNOW
VERY
LITTLE
ABOUT
JESUS
AS
A
PERSON
WE
ONLY
HAVE
HIS
RECORDED
UTTERANCES
IN
A
SET
OF
NARRATIVES
BY
HIS
FOLLOWERS
AND
SOME
VERY
SMALL
REFERENCES
FROM
COMTEMPORARY
HISTORIANS
REVELATION
ASIDE
ONE
CAN
ONLY
KNOW
CHRIST
SECONDHAND
OR
WORSE
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
DEBUNK
CHRISTIANITY
ALTHOUGH
IT
MAY
SEEM
THAT
WAY
INITIALLY
THE
POINT
IM
TRYING
TO
MAKE
IS
THAT
WE
ONLY
REALLY
HAVE
THE
BIBLE
TO
INTERPRET
AND
THAT
INTERPRETATION
IS
BY
HUMANITY
I
GUESS
THIS
IS
WHERE
FAITH
OR
RELEVATION
COMES
IN
WITH
ALL
ITS
INHERENT
SUBJECTIVENESS
METAPHYSICALLY
IF
THERE
ARE
MULTIPLE
MORAL
CODES
THEN
THERE
IS
NO
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
CODE
AND
I
THINK
THIS
IS
THEOLOGICALLY
QUESTIONABLE
NO
THERE
MAY
BE
AN
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
CODE
THERE
ARE
UNDOUBTABLY
MULTIPLE
MORAL
CODES
THE
MULTIPLE
MORAL
CODES
MAY
BE
FOUNDED
IN
THE
ABSOLUTE
MORAL
CODE
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
A
PARENT
MAY
TELL
A
CHILD
NEVER
TO
SWEAR
AND
THE
CHILD
MAY
ASSUME
THAT
THE
PARENT
NEVER
SWEARS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
PARENT
HAS
TOLD
THE
CHILD
THAT
IT
IS
WRONG
NOW
THE
PARENT
MAY
SWEAR
LIKE
A
TROOPER
IN
THE
PUB
OR
BAR
WHERE
THERE
ARE
NO
CHILDREN
THE
WRONGNESS
HERE
IS
IF
THE
CHILD
DISOBEYS
THE
PARENT
THE
PARENT
MAY
FEEL
THAT
IT
IS
INAPPROPRIATE
TO
SWEAR
IN
FRONT
OF
CHILDREN
BUT
MAY
BE
QUITE
HAPPY
TO
SWEAR
IN
FRONT
OF
ANIMALS
THE
ANALOGY
DOES
NOT
QUITE
HOLD
WATER
BECAUSE
THE
CHILD
KNOWS
THAT
HE
IS
OF
THE
SAME
TYPE
AS
THE
PARENT
AND
MAY
BE
A
PARENT
LATER
IN
LIFE
BUT
YOU
GET
THE
GIST
OF
IT
INCIDENTALLY
THE
YOUNG
CHILD
CONSIDERS
THE
DIRECTIVE
AS
ABSOLUTE
UNTIL
HE
GETS
OLDER
SEE
PIAGET
AND
LEARNS
A
MORALITY
OF
HIS
OWN
DAVID
ON
RELIGION
OH
WHERE
IS
THE
SEA
THE
FISHES
CRIED
AS
THEY
SWAM
ITS
CLEARNESS
THROUGH
