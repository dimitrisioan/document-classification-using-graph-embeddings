i
must
correct
the
following
in
my
previous
posting
if
you
are
trying
to
be
objective
you
must
also
recognise
that
the
gospels
are
not
independent
sources
on
the
contrary
they
share
much
of
the
same
material
i
should
have
been
a
bit
more
careful
here
the
gospels
not
only
tell
us
about
the
same
events
they
usually
use
the
same
wordings
textual
analyses
show
that
matthew
and
luke
probably
had
a
common
source
which
may
have
influenced
