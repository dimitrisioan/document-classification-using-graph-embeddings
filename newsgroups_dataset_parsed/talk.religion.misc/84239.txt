MIKE

WRITES
WHY
IS
THE
NT
TOSSED
OUT
AS
INFO
ON
JESUS
I
REALIZE
IT
IS
NORMALLY
TOSSED
OUT
BECAUSE
IT
CONTAINS
MIRACLES
BUT
WHAT
ARE
THE
OTHER
REASONS
IT
IS
NOT
TOSSED
OUT
AS
A
SOURCE
BUT
WOULD
IT
BE
REGARDED
AS
UNBIASED
AND
INDEPENDANT
THIS
BRINGS
UP
ANOTHER
SOMETHING
I
HAVE
NEVER
UNDERSTOOD
I
ASKED
THIS
ONCE
BEFORE
AND
GOT
A
FEW
INTERESTING
RESPONSES
BUT
SOMEHOW
DIDNT
SEEM
SATISFIED
WHY
WOULD
THE
NT
NOT
BE
CONSIDERED
A
GOOD
SOURCE
THIS
MIGHT
BE
A
LITERARYHISTORICAL
QUESTION
BUT
WHEN
I
STUDIED
HISTORY
I
ALWAYS
LOOKED
FOR
FIRSTHAND
ORIGINAL
SOURCES
TO
WRITE
MY
PAPERS
IF
THE
TOPIC
WAS
ON
MR
X
I
LOOKED
TO
SEE
IF
MR
X
WROTE
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
IF
THE
TOPIC
WAS
ON
A
GROUP
LOOK
FOR
THE
GROUP
ETC
IF
THE
TOPIC
IS
ON
MR
X
AND
MR
X
DID
NOT
WRITE
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
BARRING
THE
THEISTIC
RESPONSE
ABOUT
THE
BIBLE
BEING
DIVINELY
INSPIRED
WHICH
I
CANT
ADEQUATELY
ARGUE
WOULDNT
WE
LOOK
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
ATE
WORKED
WALKED
TALKED
ETC
WITH
HIM
IF
SOMEONE
WAS
AT
AN
EVENT
WOULDNT
THEY
BE
A
BETTER
REPORTER
THAN
SOMEONE
WHO
HEARD
ABOUT
IT
SECOND
HAND
I
GUESS
ISNT
FIRSTHAND
BETTER
THAN
SECOND
HAND
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
BIAS
AND
WINNERS
WRITING
HISTORY
BUT
DOESNT
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
FIRSTHAND
BEING
BEST
STILL
APPLY
