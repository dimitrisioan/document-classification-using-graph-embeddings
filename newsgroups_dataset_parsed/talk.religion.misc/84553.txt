YOU
KEEP
MAKING
REFERENCES
TO
ORTHODOX
BELIEF
AND
SAYING
RA
THINGS

IT

HELD
THAT
CF
KERMIT
THREAD
ON
WHAT
RA
EXACT
BODY
OF
THEOLOGY
ARE
YOU
DRAWING
FOR
WHAT
YOU
CALL
ORTHODOX
ORTHODOX
IS
A
COMPOUND
WORD
IT
COMES
FROM
ORTHOS
STRAIGHT
TRUE
RIGHT
AND
FROM
DOXA
OPINION
DOCTRINE
TEACHING
I
USE
ORTHODOX
TO
REFER
TO
RIGHT
TEACHING
AS
OPPOSED
TO
UNIVERSAL
OR
CATHOLIC
OR
FOURSQUARE
GOSPLE
I
THINK
THAT
THE
GREEK
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
WOULD
TAKE
HIGH
OFFENSE
AT
YOUR
MISUSE
OF
THE
WORD
YOUR
VERSION
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NEITHER
MAINSTREAM
NOR
BIBLE
DERIVED
YOU
MAKE
CLAIMS
OF
BIBLECENTRICITY
THAT
ARE
NOT
DERIVABLE
SOLEY
FROM
THE
BIBLE
ABOUT
SIXSEVEN
MONTHS
AGO
YOU
CLAIMED
THAT
YOUR
PRIMARY
OBJECTION
TO
THE
LDS
WAS
THAT
OUR
DOCTRINE
WAS
NOT
BIBLEDERIVED
AND
NOW
THIS
AND
OTHER
CLAIMS
CAN
BE
SHOWN
ARE
ALSO
NOT
BIBLE
INTERPETING
BIBLE
RIGHT
TEACHING
IS
DERIVED
FROM
LETTING
GOD
SPEAK
TO
US
THROUGH
THE
BIBLE
THIS
CAN
BE
FROM
READING
SIMPLE
TRUTHS
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
BY
USING
THE
BIBLE
TO
INTERPRET
THE
BIBLE
SIMPLE
TRUTHS
OH
FOR
EXAMPLE
RA
WHO
IS
THAT
HOLDS
THAT
LUKE
MEANT
WHAT
YOU
SAID
HE
MEANT
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
APPARENT
FROM
READING
THE
SCRIPTURES
THAT
ARE
PERTINENT
LUKE
RECORDS
CHRISTS
PROMISE
TO
THE
REPENTANT
THIEF
WHO
HUNG
ON
AN
ADJACENT
CROSS
TRULY
I
SAY
TO
YOU
TODAY
YOU
WILL
BE
WITH
ME
IN
PARADISE
BUT
WAS
IT
NOT
UNTIL
LATER
THAT
CHRIST
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
ASCENDED
TO
HEAVEN
IF
CHRIST
HIMSELF
WAS
NOT
IN
HEAVEN
UNTIL
SUNDAY
HOW
COULD
THE
REPENTANT
THIEF
HAVE
BEEN
THERE
WITH
HIM
THE
ANSWER
LIES
IN
THE
LOCATION
OF
PARADISE
WHEN
JESUS
DIED
APPARENTLY
PARADISE
WAS
NOT
EXALTED
TO
HEAVEN
UNTIL
EASTER
DAY
PARADISE
EXALTED
TO
HEAVEN
PARADISE
WASNT
EQUAL
TO
HEAVEN
AND
NOW
IT
IS
YET
YOU
CLAIM
THAT
PEEPLE
CAN
NOT
BE
EXALTED
TO
HEAVEN
NICHT
WAHR
JESUS
REFERS
TO
IT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
STORY
OF
THE
RICH
MAN
AND
LAZARUS
AS
ABRAHAMS
BOSOM
TO
WHICH
THE
GODLY
BEGGAR
LAZARUS
WAS
CARRIED
BY
THE
ANGELS
AFTER
HIS
DECEASE
LUKE
THUS
ABRAHAMS
BOSOM
REFERRED
TO
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THE
SOULS
OF
THE
REDEEMED
WAITED
TILL
THE
DAY
OF
CHRISTS
RESURRECTION
WHEN
I
READ
THE
STORY
I
FOUND
THAT
ABRAHAMS
BOSOM
WASNT
SO
MUCH
A
PLACE
BUT
SOMEWHERE
THE
RICH
MAN
COULD
SEE
AND
TALK
TO
ABRAHAM
IT
WAS
NOT
YET
LIFTED
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
IT
MAY
WELL
HAVE
BEEN
A
SECTION
OF
HADES
HEBREW
SHEOL
RESERVED
FOR
BELIEVERS
WHO
HAD
DIED
IN
THE
FAITH
BUT
WOULD
NOT
BE
ADMITTED
INTO
THE
GLORIOUS
PRESENCE
OF
GOD
IN
HEAVEN
UNTIL
THE
PRICE
OF
REDEMPTION
HAD
ACTUALLY
BEEN
PAID
ON
CALVARY
OR
EVEN
THAT
NONE
WOULD
PRECEDE
THE
PRESENCE
OF
JESUS
BACK
TO
GLORY
WITH
THE
FATHER
GEE
THIS
IS
FAIRLY
CLOSE
TO
WHAT
THE
LDS
CALL
SPIRIT
PRISON
AND
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
CALLED
FALSE
DOCTRINE
DOUBTLESS
IT
WAS
THE
INFERNAL
PARADISE
THAT
THE
SOULS
OF
JESUS
AND
THE
REPENTANT
THIEF
REPAIRED
AFTER
THEY
EACH
DIED
ON
FRIDAY
AFTERNOON
BUT
ON
SUNDAY
AFTER
THE
RISEN
CHRIST
HAD
FIRST
APPEARED
TO
MARY
MAGDALENE
JOHN
AND
HER
TWO
COMPANIONS
MATTHEW
PRESUMABLY
HE
THEN
TOOK
UP
WITH
HIM
TO
GLORY
ALL
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
INFERNAL
PARADISE

ABRAHAM

IT

YOUR

BY

POSTION
IS
NOT
SUPPORTABLE
MAKEING
SUCH
A
CLAIM
REQUIRES
MORE
EVIDENCE
THAN
YOU
HAVE
GIVEN
HERE
RA
WHENEVER
YOUR
PERSONAL
INTERPRETATION
OF
BIBLICAL
PASSAGES
IS
RA
CHALLENGED
YOUR
ONLY
RESPONSE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
ONE
NEEDS
MERELY
TO
RA
LOOK
AT
THE
BIBLE
IN
ORDER
TO
SEE
THE
TRUTH
BUT
WHAT
OF
THOSE
WHO
RA
SEE
BIBLICAL
THINGS
DIFFERENTLY
FROM
YOU
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
CHARACTERIZATION
IS
FAULTY
WHENEVER
MY
PERSONAL
INTERPRETATION
IS
QUESTIONED
I
USUALLY
GIVE
A
REASON
YES
AND
YOUR
REASONS
ARE
IN
GENERAL
NOT
SUPPORTED
BY
ANY
DIRECT
READING
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
YOU
HAVE
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
YOU
CLAIMS
TO
SCRIPTURAL
PROOF
NEED
TO
BE
CROSSCHECKED
THE
REFERENCS
THAT
YOU
SUPPLY
OFTEN
DO
NOT
SUPPORT
YOUR
POSTION
IF
THEY
ARE
READ
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
SCRIPTURE
AS
FOR
THOSE
THAT
SEE
THINGS
DIFFERENTLY
PLEASE
PUT
FORWARD
WHERE
THERE
IS
A
VALID
DIFFERENCE
AND
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
IT
I
SEEM
TO
BE
SEEING
FROM
YOU
THE
NOTION
THAT
ANY
DIFFERENCE
IN
HOW
ONE
VIEWS
THE
BIBLE
IS
SOMEHOW
LEGITIMATE
EXCEPT
OR
COURSE
FOR
THE
STUFF
THAT
I
GLEAN
FROM
IT
PUT
FORWARD
A
CONTRARY
VIEW
AND
PERHAPS
WE
CAN
HAVE
A
DISCUSSION
ON
THAT
TOPIC
BUT
TO
DECRY
SOMETHING
THAT
I
PUT
FORWARD
WITHOUT
PUTTING
FORWARD
SOMETHING
ELSE
TO
DISCUSS
AND
TO
DISMISS
WHAT
I
PUT
FORWARD
WHILE
GIVING
CREDENCE
TO
OTHER
ALLEGED
VIEWS
THAT
HAVE
YET
TO
BE
PUT
FORWARD
IS
SIMPLY
BEING
CONTENTIOUS
HOW
ABOUT
THAT
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
IN
PARADISE
AND
HAVE
ACCEPTED
THE
GOSPLE
WILL
BE
JUDGED
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
THEN
RETURN
TO
THE
PRESENCE
OF
GOD
IS
THAT
SOMEHOW
DIFFERENT
FROM
YOUR
EXPRESSED
VIEW
THAT
THE
PARADISE
SPOKEN
OF
OR
ABRAHAMS
BOSOM
RA
ARE
WE
TO
SIMPLY
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
REALLY
RA
UNDERSTANDS
IT
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
SOMETHING
THAT
I
HAVE
DRAWN
FROM
SCRIPTURE
IS
WRONG
THEN
PLEASE
SHOW
ME
FROM
SCRIPTURE
WHERE
IT
IS
WRONG
SIMPLY
STATING
THAT
THERE
ARE
OTHER
VIEWS
IS
NOT
A
PROOF
SHOW
IT
TO
ME
FROM
SCRIPTURE
AND
THEN
WE
CAN
GO
ON
SHOULD
WE
GO
BACK
AND
DISCUSS
YOUR
VIEW
ON
WHY
THE
ANGLE
OF
THE
LORD
IS
THE
LORD
