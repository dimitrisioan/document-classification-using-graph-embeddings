RE
CHRISTIAN
METAETHICS
I
WROTE
AND
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
INTERPRETATION
IS
TWISTED
THERE
ARE
MANY
PASSAGES
IN
THE
BIBLE
THAT
IN
THEIR
MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD
READING
SHOW
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
BEHAVING
IN
JUST
THIS
WAY
IN
ARTICLE
DAVE
DAVIS
WRITES
THIS
REQUIRES
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
ALL
INTERPRETATIONS
ARE
EQUALLY
VALID
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OF
REASONABLY
DISTINGUISHING
AMONG
THEM
I
WOULDNT
MAKE
THAT
ASSUMPTION
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
A
REASONABLE
ASSUMPTION
NO
IT
FOLLOWS
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
MOST
CHRISTIANS
CHOICE
OF
INTERPRETATION
STEMS
FROM
A
MIX
OF
BELIEFS
THAT
ARE
INFLUENCED
BY
THE
SECULAR
ETHICS
OF
THEIR
CULTURE
AND
THAT
ARE
NOT
FULLY
DETERMINED
BY
SCRIPTURE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THERE
IS
SOME
RIGHT
INTERPRETATION
MATTERS
NOT
FEW
CHRISTIANS
CLAIM
THE
ABILITY
TO
READ
THE
MIND
OF
THEIR
GOD
DAVE
DAVIS
SHOULD
NOTE
THAT
IT
WAS
MICHAEL
WHO
FIRST
STATED
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
SECULAR
AND
CULTURAL
INFLUENCE
IN
THIS
THREAD
I
THINK
MICHAEL
IS
RIGHT
IN
THIS
BUT
REGARDLESS
IT
SHOULD
BE
NOTED
THAT
THIS
HAS
NOT
BEEN
A
POINT
OF
CONTENTION
BETWEEN
MICHAEL
AND
MYSELF
I
HAVE
ARGUED
BEYOND
MICHAELS
CLAIMS
THAT
THE
CHRISTIAN
SCRIPTURES
ARE
OPEN
TO
SO
MANY
INTERPRETATIONS
INCLUDING
A
WIDE
DIVERGENCE
WITHIN
THE
CHRISTIAN
TRADITION
THAT
EVEN
THEIR
MOST
IMPORTANT
THEMES
ARE
VAGUE
AGAIN
IT
DOES
NOT
MATTER
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
RIGHT
INTERPRETATION
UNLESS
THERE
IS
A
WAY
TO
DETERMINE
WHAT
THAT
RIGHT
INTERPRETATION
IS
IT
IS
THE
LACK
OF
AN
OBJECTIVE
MEASURE
NOT
THE
PRESUMED
LACK
OF
AN
ANSWER
THAT
PUTS
THE
FORCE
BEHIND
THE
LINE
I
ARGUE
MICHAEL
AND
I
AND
OTHERS
READ
THE
BIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIAN
GLASSES
AMONG
THE
THINGS
THAT
THIS
SHOULD
IMPLY
IS
THAT
THE
NT
INFORMS
THE
OT
EVEN
TO
THE
POINT
OF
DOMINANTING
IT
SOME
POINTS
IN
THE
OT
CEREMONIAL
DIETARY
LAWS
ARE
EXPLICITLY
ABROGATED
BY
THE
NT
TEXTS
THERE
ARE
ENOUGH
CHRISTIAN
GLASSES
VARYING
OVER
A
SUFFICIENTLY
BROAD
RANGE
OF
COLOR
THAT
I
CAN
FIND
A
FEW
THAT
SUPPORT
MY
EXAMPLE
NO
MICHAEL
THE
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
ALSO
TAKE
THE
GOSPEL
SERIOUSLY
WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES
YOU
IS
THE
WAY
YOU
INTERPRET
THE
GOSPEL
RUSSELL
TURPINS
NO
HERE
IS
MISPLACED
NOT
TO
SAY
INAPPROPRIATE
MICHAELS
SELFDESCRIPTION
MUST
GOVERN
THE
EQUATION
OF
RADICAL
LIBERAL
WHICH
SEEMS
IMPLIED
BY
RUSSELL
TURPIN
IS
WRONG
IN
MY
OPINION
WHAT
MAKES
MICHAEL
RADICAL
IS
THAT
HE
FULLY
ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT
CHRISTIAN
SCRIPTURE
AND
TRADITION
FAIL
TO
DETERMINE
THE
DOCTRINES
THAT
SO
MANY
BRANCHES
WITHIN
CHRISTIANITY
HOLD
DEAR
HE
IS
WILLING
TO
LIVE
AND
PRACTICE
HIS
RELIGION
WITHIN
THIS
INDETERMINACY
AND
HE
IS
WILLING
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
MUCH
OF
HIS
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THINGS
CHRISTIAN
IS
INFLUENCED
BY
IDEAS
THAT
ARE
NOT
PURELY
CHRISTIAN
THOSE
CHRISTIANS
I
HAVE
CALLED
CONSERVATIVE
MUST
ALSO
INTERPRET
BUT
THEY
DO
NOT
RECOGNIZE
OR
AT
LEAST
ARE
UNWILLING
TO
ADMIT
THE
EXTENT
AND
IMPORTANCE
OF
THIS
RUSSELL
TURPIN
IN
AN
EARLIER
POST
HAD
SAID
THAT
MICHAEL
MICHAELS
THEOLOGICAL
POSITIONS
ACTUALLY
DIDNT
TELL
HIM
MUCH
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
DEAN
SIMEON
RESPONDS
THIS
TIME
GENTLY
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
MORE
DIRECT
PERHAPS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
WHAT
COULD
YOU
POSSIBLY
MEAN
THE
IMPLIED
RHETORICAL
EFFORT
TO
SEPARATE
MICHAEL
FROM
THE
TRADITION
IS
A
FAILURE
MICHAEL
IS
IN
THE
TRADITION
IF
YOUR
IDEA
OF
THE
TRADITION
DOESNT
INCLUDE
HIM
CHANGE
YOUR
IDEA
OF
THE
TRADITION
I
RECOGNIZE
THAT
MICHAEL
IS
PART
OF
THE
TRADITION
BUT
WHAT
DOES
IT
TELL
ONE
ABOUT
A
TRADITION
COVERING
ORIGEN
AQUINAS
JERRY
FALLWELL
AND
JESSE
JACKSON
THAT
IT
ALSO
INCLUDES
MICHAEL
SIEMON
NOT
VERY
MUCH
IN
SHORT
IT
IS
THE
EXTRACHRISTIAN
PRINCIPLES
THAT
MAKE
MICHAELS
CHRISTIANITY
BENEFICIAL
AND
I
SUSPECT
THEY
WOULD
BE
AS
BENEFICIAL
PERHAPS
MORESO
WITHOUT
BEING
FILTERED
BY
CHRISTIAN
INTERPRETATION
THIS
CONCLUSION
DOES
NOT
FOLLOW
EVEN
IN
SHORT
FROM
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
GOES
BEFORE
A
SURPRISING
LOGICAL
ELLIPSIS
I
THINK
THE
CONCLUSION
DOES
FOLLOW
THE
PURELY
CHRISTIAN
PRINCIPLES
THAT
MICHAEL
HAS
ARE
THE
ONES
HE
SHARES
WITH
OTHERS
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
TRADITION
OR
THAT
CAN
BE
DERIVED
FROM
CHRISTIAN
SCRIPTURE
THESE
NECESSARILY
VAGUE
ARE
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
DRIVE
HIS
POLITICAL
STANCES
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
LOVE
ONES
NEIGHBOR
IS
A
PURELY
CHRISTIAN
PRINCIPLE
THAT
THIS
MEANS
SHOWING
TOLERANCE
FOR
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
NOT
AS
TO
THESE
POLITICAL
STANCES
THEY
ARE
OFTEN
AT
ODDS
WITH
WHAT
IS
COMMONLY
HELD
IN
MOST
OF
CURRENT
CHRISTENDOM
AND
SO
I
SUSPECT
THEY
COULD
BE
BETTER
PRESSED
OUTSIDE
IT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
CAN
WELL
UNDERSTAND
THE
COUNTERPOINT
THAT
THESE
POLITICAL
STANCES
BECOME
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
WHEN
PRESENTED
TO
THOSE
WHO
NEED
THEM
MOST
THIS
IS
A
THEOLOGICAL
STATEMENT
WORTHY
OF
BARTH
DR
TURPIN
DD
MAY
WEAR
THE
BLACK
ROBE
OF
GENEVA
YET
HAVING
BARELY
SURVIVED
THE
EFFORT
TO
FINISH
IN
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
I
DOUBT
I
WILL
ATTEMPT
A
MORE
DIFFICULT
FIELD
ANY
TIME
SOON
