RED
HERRING
WRITES
BDS
WERE
NOT
CONTEMPLATING
SUECIDE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THEY
COMMITTED
ONE
NO
REASON
HOW
ABOUT
THESE
TWO
SOME
OF
THE
SURVIVORS
CLAIMED
THAT
BD
MEMBERS
POURED
FUEL
ALONG
THE
CORRIDORS
AND
SET
FIRE
TO
IT
THE
SPEED
AT
WHICH
THE
FIRE
SPREAD
IS
NOT
INCONSISTENT
WITH
THIS
CLAIM
THIS
MORNING
ON
CNN
TUES
APRIL
TEXAS
COPS
SAY
ARSON
IS
SUSPECTED
BECAUSE
OF
TWO
FALSH
POINTS
CNN
ALSO
STATED
THAT
ALL
SURVIORS
CLAIM
THE
FIRES
ARE
FBI
SET
YOUR
ARGUMENT
ARE
MADEUP
UNTRUE
AND
UNVERIFIED
AT
BEST
THERE
WAS
CERTAINLY
A
FIRE
WHICH
KILLED
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
THERE
IS
A
VERY
VERY
GOOD
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THE
FBI
DID
NOT
START
THIS
FIRE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BDS
DID
THE
DAY
OF
THE
ATTACK
THE
FBI
CLAIMED
TO
HAVE
SEEN
TWO
BDERS
SETTING
THE
FIRE
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
COMPOUND
YESTERDAY
THE
ARSON
SQUAD
SAID
TWO
FLASH
POINTS
AT
THE
OR
NEAR
THE
TANK
ENTRY
POINTS
NOT
GOOD
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
FBI
HIT
SQUAD
EVEN
IF
THE
BDS
WERE
NOT
CONTEMPLATING
SUICIDE
IT
IS
VERY
POSSIBLE
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
CONVINCED
AND
THUS
CONVINCED
THE
OTHERS
THAT
THIS
WAS
NOT
SUICIDE
IT
WAS
THE
FULFILMENT
OF
A
PROFECY
OF
SOME
SORT
IS
THERE
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THINKING
THAT
YOU
WONT
SURVIVE
A
CONFRONTATION
WITH
THE
FBI
PARNOIA
AND
COMMITTING
SUICIDE
THERE
ARE
THREE
POSSIBILITIES
OTHER
THAN
THE
BDS
SELF
DESTRUCTION
B
THE
FIRE
WAS
STARTED
BY
AN
FBI
ACCIDENT
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
FOOLISH
OF
US
TO
DECLARE
THIS
OUTRIGHT
UNTIL
MORE
EVIDENCE
CAN
BACK
IT
SURE
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
ARMORED
VEHICLE
KNOCKED
DOWN
A
LANTERN
WHICH
STARTED
THE
FIRE
WHY
WAS
THERE
A
LIT
LANTERN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
DAY
NEAR
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
COMPLEX
ITS
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
CONTRADICTED
BY
OTHER
ESCAPEES
NO
CLAIMED
BY
THE
ESCAPEES
NOT
CONTRADICTED
WHAT
IM
FINDING
INTERESTING
IS
THE
CONFLICTING
REPORTS
FBI
SAYS
THAT
BODIES
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND
WITH
BULLET
WOUNDS
AND
THE
TEXAS
CORNUERS
SP
SAYS
THAT
THEY
HAVENT
