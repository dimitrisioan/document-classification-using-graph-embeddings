re
swastika
was
hitler
pagan
or
christian
the
observation
that
the
tree
of
life
would
rotate
clockwise
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
counterclockwise
in
the
southern
probably
doesnt
give
enough
consideration
to
the
feebleness
of
the
coriolis
force
compared
to
say
the
phototropism
of
vegetation
a
much
more
likely
explanation
is
the
classic
one
that
the
clockwise
swastika
is
the
sunwheel
because
the
sun
progresses
across
the
sky
that
way
although
thats
not
the
historical
way
it
happened
clocks
were
first
made
as
little
imitation
images
of
the
sun
moving
thru
the
heavens
so
its
more
valid
to
talk
of
the
clock
going
sunwise
but
do
the
engineers
listen
to
me
of
course
not
anyway
there
is
still
much
uncertainty
about
whether
the
antiswastika
goes
countersunwise
because
that
represents
evil
or
because
it
is
the
suns
twinopposite
the
moonwheel
the
use
of
antisun
to
represent
evil
may
be
because
humans
are
so
strongly
visuallyoriented
but
im
not
going
to
try
to
settle
that
one
just
now
