why
isnt
this
falsifiable
ie
there
is
no
god
the
world
has
existed
forever
and
had
no
starting
point
how
does
one
falsify
gods
existance
this
again
is
a
belief
not
a
scien
tific
premise
the
original
thread
referred
specifically
to
scientific
creationism
this
means
whatever
theory
or
theories
you
propose
must
be
able
to
be
judged
by
the
scientific
method
this
is
in
contrast
to
purely
philosophical
arguments
if
given
a
definite
definition
of
god
it
is
sometimes
possible
to
falsify
the
existance
of
that
god
but
when
one
refuses
to
give
an
immutable
definition
one
can
not
whatever
promises
that
have
been
made
can
than
be
broken
john
laws
a
man
without
the
honor
to
keep
his
given
word
