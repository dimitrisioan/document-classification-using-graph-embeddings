comments
about
how
christians
have
to
follow
the
ot
deleted
i
will
clarify
my
earlier
quote
gods
laws
were
originally
written
for
the
israelites
jesus
changed
that
fact
by
now
making
the
law
applicable
to
all
people
not
just
the
jews
gentiles
could
be
part
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
through
the
saving
grace
of
god
i
never
said
that
the
law
was
made
obsolete
by
jesus
exodus
how
many
people
have
you
put
to
death
for
working
on
the
sabbath
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
if
youll
notice
he
also
reams
into
the
pharisees
for
mucking
up
the
law
with
their
own
contrived
interpretations
they
knew
every
letter
of
the
law
and
followed
it
with
their
heads
but
not
their
hearts
that
is
why
he
points
out
that
our
righteousness
must
surpass
that
of
the
pharisees
in
order
to
be
accepted
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
people
such
as
the
pharisees
are
those
who
really
go
out
of
their
way
to
debate
about
the
number
of
angels
that
can
dance
on
the
head
of
a
pin
they
had
become
legalistic
rulemakers
religious
lawyers
who
practiced
the
letter
of
the
law
but
never
really
believed
in
it
leviticus
how
as
that
mediumrare
steak
last
night
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
leviticus
what
did
you
wear
to
work
friday
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
deutromony
i
can
you
can
now
justify
discrimination
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it
because
god
respects
it
too
right
god
be
with
you
