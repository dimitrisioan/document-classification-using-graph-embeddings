brent
said
in
response
to
pvasilion
but
then
i
dont
pack
heavy
weaponry
with
intent
to
use
it
you
dont
really
think
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
keep
that
stuff
do
you
if
so
tell
me
where
you
live
so
i
can
be
sure
to
steer
well
clear
the
public
also
has
rights
and
they
should
be
placed
above
those
of
the
individual
go
ahead
call
me
a
commie
but
youd
be
singing
a
different
tune
if
i
exercised
my
right
to
rape
your
daughter
he
broke
the
law
he
was
a
threat
to
society
they
did
there
job
simple
you
have
no
evidence
that
david
koresh
or
his
followers
were
packing
that
heavy
weaponry
with
any
intent
to
use
for
other
that
recreational
and
selfdefense
purposes
your
statement
that
the
public
also
has
rights
is
correct
only
is
parsed
as
the
individuals
who
comprise
the
public
also
have
rights
there
is
no
separate
rightsbearing
entity
known
as
the
public
since
the
rights
of
the
public
of
which
you
spoke
are
in
fact
only
rights
of
individuals
the
statement
that
the
rights
of
the
public
should
be
placed
above
the
rights
of
the
individual
has
no
meaning
you
have
artificially
created
an
illusionary
conflict
of
individuals
rights
when
you
speak
of
my
right
to
rape
your
daughter
no
person
has
the
right
to
rape
another
person
therefore
there
is
no
conflict
how
do
you
define
society
do
you
hold
that
this
society
is
a
rightsbearing
entity
which
is
separate
from
any
individual
people
how
do
you
define
a
threat
to
society
to
what
extent
do
you
believe
that
a
person
loses
his
rights
when
he
is
declared
by
whom
to
be
such
a
threat
