dennis
kriz
writes
a
lot
of
religious
opinions
and
quotations
from
the
bible
and
from
many
catholic
theologians
and
papal
bulls
which
although
introduced
with
a
smiley
was
not
as
funny
as
it
might
have
been
notable
exception
subject
headers
such
as
ones
dick
is
ones
instrument
of
redemption
and
indeed
the
posting
seemed
to
be
more
a
vehicle
for
the
religious
text
than
for
any
literarymoral
analysis
i
am
surprised
and
saddened
i
would
expect
this
kind
of
behavior
from
the
evangelical
bornagain
gospelthumping
inyourface
were
theonlytruechristian
protestants
but
i
have
always
thought
that
catholics
behaved
better
than
this
friend
dennis
i
urge
you
to
follow
the
example
of
your
fellow
catholics
of
who
i
count
many
dozens
as
my
friends
and
practice
your
faith
through
good
example
and
decent
living
and
respect
for
the
common
humanity
of
others
please
do
not
stoop
to
the
level
of
the
e
ba
gt
iyf
wtotc
protestants
who
think
that
the
best
way
to
witness
is
to
be
strident
intrusive
loud
insulting
and
overbearingly
selfrighteous
the
imagery
in
the
song
of
solomon
is
a
little
bit
dated
get
it
middle
east
date
palms
oh
never
mind
but
apparently
acceptable
on
a
steaminess
level
to
be
accepted
as
part
of
the
canon
from
this
fact
i
derive
that
erotica
itself
is
not
incompatible
with
catholic
doctrine
is
there
such
a
thing
as
catholic
erotica
not
necessarily
a
love
story
between
people
of
that
faith
but
a
love
story
that
is
not
exploitative
does
not
seek
redemption
through
penis
size
pays
proper
respect
to
the
dignity
of
each
partner
and
is
still
erotic
enough
to
have
a
place
on
ass
i
would
submit
that
the
darknites
series
of
stories
qualify
also
most
of
the
journal
entries
and
rings
i
and
ii
i
would
guess
that
your
aim
is
to
cut
down
on
the
pornography
and
increase
the
erotica
i
actually
agree
with
you
that
nearly
all
of
the
ive
got
an
enormous
dick
and
i
shot
my
wad
all
over
her
face
stories
are
crap
i
count
them
as
noise
which
makes
my
take
on
the
signaltonoise
ration
much
lower
than
many
other
peoples
since
you
are
one
of
the
few
posters
here
who
can
actually
write
decent
prose
could
you
write
a
few
stories
for
us
instead
of
overwhelming
us
with
commentary
anyway
this
is
a
big
subject
please
add
your
comments
additions
and
observations
sincerely
dennis

you
