A
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
MUST
HAVE
MISSED
WHEN
YOU
SAID
THIS
ABOUT
THESE
OTHER
PROMISES
OF
GOD
THAT
WE
KEEP
GETTING
SUBJECTED
TO
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
WHY
I
AM
WRONG
AND
THEY
ARE
OK
OR
AN
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
OF
PUBLIC
HYPOCRISY
BOTH
OR
NEITHER
SO
ACCORDING
TO
YOU
JIM
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
CRITICIZE
ONE
PERSON
FOR
TAKING
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
WITHOUT
BEING
A
HYPOCRITE
IS
TO
POST
A
RESPONSE
TO
EVERY
PERSON
ON
TRM
WHO
TAKES
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
DID
I
EITHER
ASK
OR
ASSERT
THAT
OR
IS
THIS
YOUR
MISAIMED
TELEPATHY
AT
WORK
AGAIN
STEPHEN
SAID
YOU
TOOK
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
YOU
NOTED
THAT
STEPHEN
HAD
NOT
REPLIED
TO
SOME
OTHER
TRM
ARTICLE
CALL
IT
A
THAT
TOOK
A
QUOTE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
BUT
THE
LACK
OF
EVIDENCE
FOR
X
DOES
NOT
CONSTITUTE
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
LACK
OF
X
A
COMMON
CREATIONIST
ERROR
SO
THE
FACT
THAT
STEPHEN
DID
NOT
REPLY
TO
A
DOES
NOT
JUSTIFY
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
STEPHEN
CONDONED
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
IN
A
YOU
ASKED
STEPHEN
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
YOU
WERE
WRONG
AND
THEY
WERE
OK
OR
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
HE
WAS
BEING
A
HYPOCRITE
BOTH
OF
THE
CHOICES
YOU
GIVE
STEPHEN
ASSUME
THAT
HE
CONDONED
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
IN
A
I
ASSUMED
YOU
WERE
BEING
LOGICAL
AND
THAT
THE
SENTENCE
THAT
BEGINS
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
WAS
NOT
A
NONSEQUITUR
BUT
WAS
INTENDED
TO
FOLLOW
FROM
THE
SENTENCE
THAT
PRECEDED
IT
THEREFORE
I
CONCLUDED
THAT
YOU
BELIEVED
THAT
IMPLIED
THAT
STEPHEN
CONDONED
TAKING
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
IN
A
BUT
WEVE
ALREADY
SEEN
THAT
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THIS
THEREFORE
YOU
WERE
INCORRECT
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
IMPLIED
THAT
STEPHEN
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
OKAY
TO
TAKE
QUOTES
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
IN
A
AND
WERE
MAKING
AN
ERROR
OF
A
KIND
THAT
IS
FREQUENTLY
MADE
BY
CREATIONISTS
IS
THAT
BETTER
JIM
ITS
CALLED
AN
ARGUMENT
IF
YOU
DISAGREE
WITH
IT
EXPLAIN
WHY
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
NOT
SOUND
I
ADMIT
THAT
MY
ASSUMPTION
IN
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
A
BIT
HASTY
IF
YOU
AGREE
WITH
IT
JUST
SAY
YUP
DJ
YUP
JIMS
EMAILED
RESPONSE
WHEN
I
POINTED
OUT
IN
A
POSTED
ARTICLE
THAT
ONE
OF
HIS
ARGUMENTS
WAS
A
STRAW
MAN
ARGUMENT
REMINISCENT
OF
A
FREQUENT
CREATIONIST
PLOY
