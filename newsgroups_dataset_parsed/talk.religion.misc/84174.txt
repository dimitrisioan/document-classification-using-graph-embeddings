lm
the
rape
has
passed
there
is
nothing
that
will
ever
take
that
away
lm
lmlmtrue
but
forcing
her
to
remain
pregnant
continues
the
violation
of
lmlmher
body
for
another
months
i
see
this
as
being
unbelievably
cruel
lm
lmlife
is
not
a
violation
lmbut
forcing
someone
to
harbor
that
life
in
their
body
is
a
violation
letting
a
mother
force
a
child
from
her
body
in
order
to
end
that
childs
life
is
the
ultimate
violation
i
happen
to
take
the
violation
of
a
person
much
more
seriously
than
the
violation
of
a
mindless
clump
of
cells
smaller
than
my
thumb
your
mileage
may
vary
