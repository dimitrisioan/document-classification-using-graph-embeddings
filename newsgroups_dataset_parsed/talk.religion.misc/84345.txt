can
we
say
that

omigod
its
an
operationalist
sorry
jim
but
the
idea
that
a
theory
explaining
a
myriad
of
distinctly
different
observations
is
merely
a
model
is
more
than
sensible
people
can
accept
your
phobia
about
objective
reality
notwithstanding
first
of
all
i
have
no
phobia
of
objective
reality
im
simply
saying
that
the
scientific
model
of
the
atom
is
probably
not
what
is
really
out
there
im
not
saying
that
theres
no
object
that
sources
these
properties
we
measure
from
atomic
theory
you
hadnt
made
that
clear
im
glad
to
have
it
clarified
so
youre
a
physical
objectivist
after
all
right
take
light
as
another
example
there
are
two
theories
particle
and
wave
each
one
fails
to
predict
the
behavior
of
light
as
some
point
so
which
is
it
particle
or
wave
you
tell
me
youre
the
sensible
one
wavicle
next
question
mark
pundurs
any
resemblance
between
my
opinions
and
those
of
wolfram
research
inc
is
purely
coincidental
