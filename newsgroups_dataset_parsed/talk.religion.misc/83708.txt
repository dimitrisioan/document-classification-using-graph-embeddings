IT
IS
WORTHWHILE
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
FORMULATORS
OF
PUBLIC
SCHOOL
EDUCATION
IN
AMERICA
WERE
FREEMASONS
PAGE
JESUS
CHRIST
NEVER
COMMANDED
TOLERATION
AS
A
MOTIVE
FOR
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
TOLERATION
IS
THE
ANTITHESIS
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
MESSAGE

THE
CENTRAL
DYNAMIC
OF
THE
FREEMASON
DRIVE
FOR
WORLD
UNITY
THROUGH
FRATERNITY
LIBERTY

AND
OF
PRAYING
THE
BLOOD
AND
THE

OF
THE
