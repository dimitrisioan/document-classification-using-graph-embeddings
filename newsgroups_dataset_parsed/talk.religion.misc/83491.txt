this
brings
up
another
question
i
still
have
to
ponder
why
is
there
so
much
antisemitism
why
do
people
hate
jews
i
dont
hate
jews
i
consider
them
to
be
like
anyone
else
sinners
we
all
are
i
dont
know
i
dont
care
about
ethnical
rights
and
wrongs
myself
but
its
evident
that
christians
consider
jews
no
longer
to
be
the
sole
selected
group
of
gods
people
while
jews
consider
this
to
be
the
case
christian
antisemitism
comes
from
the
obvious
fact
that
the
jews
should
know
the
hebrew
scriptures
better
than
anyone
else
yet
they
did
not
convert
to
christianity
en
mass
thus
rejecting
christian
love
no
wonder
this
caused
antisemitism
one
might
even
wonder
that
if
christianity
didnt
do
this
separation
would
antisemitism
have
even
started
i
dont
see
why
not
where
are
the
rest
of
the
tribal
people
what
happened
to
the
tribes
of
the
americas
culture
is
seen
as
different
and
undesirable
in
the
west
particular
in
the
us
with
its
failed
melting
pot
concept
most
tribes
have
been
hunted
to
extinction
the
hebrew
tribe
is
one
of
the
few
survivers
from
the
neolithic
of
course
it
becomes
difficult
at
times
to
separate
christianity
from
the
western
experience
so
perhaps
you
are
right
perhaps
it
would
have
been
a
better
world
if
the
cultural
experiment
in
christianity
never
happened
