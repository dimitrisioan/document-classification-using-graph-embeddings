theres
no

einstein
and
bohr
have
told
us
that
speaking
as
one
who
knows
relativity
and
quantum
mechanics
i
say
bullshit
speaking
as
someone
who
also
knows
relativity
and
quantum
mechanics
i
say
go
ahead
punk
make
my
day
my
degree
can
beat
up
your
degree
simple
take
out
some
physics
books
and
start
looking
for
statements
which
say
that
there
is
no
objective
physics
i
doubt
you
will
find
any
you
might
find
statements
that
there
is
no
objective
length
or
no
objective
location
but
no
objective
physics
consider
for
instance
that
speedoflightin
vacuum
is
invariant
this
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
an
objective
speedoflightinvacuum
or
you
can
try
not
confuse
a
construct
with
the
constructor
if
you
take
a
look
at
quantum
mechanics
many
objective
observations
can
be
made
as
well
however
physics
is
not
objective
bohr
said
the
randomness
of
atomic
motion
is
inherent
in
the
motion
itself
einstein
said
that
nature
is
deterministic
it
is
our
method
of
observation
that
inserts
the
randomness
they
were
talking
about
the
exact
same
results
but
neither
of
them
claimed
to
have
experimental
evidence
that
proved
them
right
in
a
similar
vein
there
is
as
yet
no
experimental
evidence
for
supersymmetric
particles
so
some
physicists
believe
in
them
and
some
dont
but
all
agree
that
either
there
is
an
objectively
true
answer
to
the
question
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
i
guess
mark
pundurs
any
resemblance
between
my
opinions
and
those
of
wolfram
research
inc
is
purely
coincidental
