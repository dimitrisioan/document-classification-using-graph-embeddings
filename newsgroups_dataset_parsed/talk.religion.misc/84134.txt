DO
YOU
JUDGE
ALL
CHRISTIANS
BY
THE
ACTS
OF
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
CALL
THEMSELVES
CHRISTIAN
AND
YET
ARE
NOT
THE
BDS
CONTRADICTED
SCRIPTURE
IN
THEIR
ACTIONS
THEY
WERE
NOT
CHRISTIAN
SIMPLE
AS
THAT
PERHAPS
YOU
HAVE
READ
TOO
MUCH
INTO
WHAT
THE
MEDIA
HAS
PORTRAYED
ASK
ANY
TRUEBELIEVING
CHRISTIAN
AND
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
THEY
WILL
DENY
ANY
ASSOCIATION
WITH
THE
BDS
EVEN
THE
DAY
ADVENTISTS
HAVE
DENIED
ANY
FURTHER
TIES
WITH
THIS
CULT
WHICH
WAS
WHAT
THEY
WERE
WELL
IF
THEY
WERE
SATANISTS
OR
FOLLOWERS
OF
AN
OBSCURE
RELIGION
THEN
I
WOULD
BE
SURE
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WOULD
IN
UNISON
CONDEMN
AND
MAKE
THIS
TO
A
SHOW
CASE
YOU
MIGHT
BE
SURE
BUT
YOU
WOULD
ALSO
BE
WRONG
AND
DOES
NOT
THIS
SHOW
THE
DANGERS
WITH
RELIGION
IN
ORDER
WORD
A
MIND
VIRUS
THAT
WILL
MAKE
MOTHERS
CAPABLE
OF
LETTING
THEIR
SMALL
CHILDREN
BURN
TO
ASHES
WHILE
THEY
SCREAM
I
SUSPECT
THE
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
IS
THE
SAME
AS
THE
ANSWER
TO
DO
NOT
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
LIKES
OF
STALIN
SHOW
THE
DANGERS
OF
ATHEISM
