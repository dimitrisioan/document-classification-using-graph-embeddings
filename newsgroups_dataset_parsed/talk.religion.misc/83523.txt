THE
CERTAINTY
OF
CONFIRMATION
BY
CONSENSUS
OF
ULEMA
SCHOLARS
OF
ISLAM
TO
THE
HUNDRETH
DEGREE
THE
MIRACLE
IS
THE
CONFORMATION
BY
THE
CREATOR
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
OF
HIS
DECLARATION
OF
PROPHETHOOD
IT
HAS
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
WORDSYOU
HAVE
INDEED
SPOKEN
THE
TRUTH
SUPPOSE
THAT
YOU
SAID
IN
THE
ASSEMBLY
OF
A
RULER
WHILE
BEING
OBSERVED
BY
HIM
THE
TRUE
RULER
HAS
APPOINTED
ME
TO
SUCH
AND
SUCH
POSITION
AT
A
TIME
WHEN
YOU
WERE
ASKED
TO
PROVE
YOUR
CLAIM
THE
WORD
YES
UTTERED
BY
THE
RULER
WOULD
SUFFICIENTLY
SUPPORT
YOU
OR
IF
THE
RULER
CHANGED
HIS
USUAL
PRACTICE
AND
ATTITUDE
AT
YOUR
REQUEST
THIS
WOULD
CONFIRM
YOUR
CLAIM
EVEN
MORE
SOUNDLY
AND
MORE
DEFINITELY
THAN
WOULD
THE
WORD
YES
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
ALLAHS
MOST
NOBLE
MESSENGER
CLAIMED
I
AM
THE
ENVOY
OF
THE
CREATOR
OF
THIS
UNIVERSE
MY
PROOF
IS
THAT
HE
WILL
CHANGE
HIS
UNBROKEN
ORDER
AT
MY
REQUEST
AND
MY
PRAYER
NOW
LOOK
AT
MY
FINGERS
HE
MAKES
THEM
RUN
LIKE
A
FOUNTAIN
WITH
FIVE
SPIGOTS
LOOK
AT
THE
MOON
BY
A
GESTURE
OF
MY
FINGER
HE
SPLITS
IT
IN
TWO
LOOK
AT
THAT
TREE
TO
AFFIRM
ME
AND
TO
BEAR
WITNESS
TO
ME
IT
MOVES
AND
COMES
NEAR
TO
ME
LOOK
AT
THIS
FOOD
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
BARELY
ENOUGH
FOR
TWO
OR
THREE
MEN
IT
SATISFIES
TWO
OR
THREE
HUNDRED
FURTHER
HE
SHOWS
HUNDREDS
OF
SIMILAR
MIRACLES
HOWEVER
THE
EVIDENCES
OF
THE
VERACITY
OF
THIS
HIGH
BEING
AND
THE
PROOFS
OF
HIS
PROPHETHOOD
ARE
NOT
RESTRICTED
TO
HIS
MIRACLES
ALL
HIS
DEEDS
AND
ACTS
HIS
WORDS
AND
BEHAVIOR
HIS
MORAL
CONDUCT
AND
MANNERS
HIS
CHARACTER
AND
APPEARANCE
PROVE
TO
THE
ATTENTIVE
HIS
TRUTHFULNESS
AND
SERIOUSNESS
INDEED
MANY
PEOPLE
SUCH
AS
ABDULLAH
B
SALAM
THE
FAMOUS
SCHOLAR
OF
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
CAME
TO
BELIEF
MERELY
BY
SEEING
HIM
AND
SAID
NO
LIE
CAN
HIDE
IN
THIS
FACE
NOR
CAN
ANY
FRAUD
BE
FOUND
IN
IT
ALTHOUGH
MANY
OF
THE
RESEARCHERS
HAVE
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
PROOFS
OF
THE
PROPHETHOOD
OF
MUHAMMAD
AND
HIS
MIRACLES
NUMBER
ABOUT
ONE
THOUSAND
THERE
ARE
THOUSANDS
PERHAPS
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
PROOFS
OF
HIS
PROPHETHOOD
AND
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
TRUTHSEEKING
MEN
MUHAKKIKIIN
WITH
VARYING
OPINIONS
HAVE
AFFIRMED
HIS
PROPHETHOOD
IN
AN
EQUAL
NUMBER
OF
WAYS
THE
WISE
OURAN
ALONE
DEMONSTRATES
THOUSANDS
OF
THE
PROOFS
OF
HIS
PROPHETHOOD
IN
ADDITION
TO
ITS
OWN
FORTY
ASPECTS
OF
MIRACULOUSNESS
SINCE
PROPHETHOOD
IS
AS
A
PHENOMENON
OF
HUMANITY
AND
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
CLAIMED
PROPHETHOOD
AND
PERFORMED
MIRACLES
HAVE
LIVED
AND
PASSED
AWAY
THEN
THE
PROPHETHOOD
OF
MUHAMMAD
SAW
IS
OF
A
CERTANITY
SUPERIOR
TO
THAT
OF
THE
PROPHETHOOD
OF
ALL
THE
OTHERS
FOR
WHATEVER
EVIDENCES
QUALITIES
AND
ATTRIBUTES
BECAME
THE
MEANS
OF
THE
PROPHETHOOD
AND
MESSENGERSHIP
OF
ALL
THE
MESSENGERS
SUCH
AS
JESUS
AS
AND
MOSES
AS
THEY
ARE
ALL
OWNED
IN
A
MORE
PERFECT
AND
COMPREHENSIVE
FASHION
BY
MUHAMMAD
SAW
AND
SINCE
THE
CAUSES
AND
MEANS
OF
PROPHETIC
AUTHORITY
EXIST
MORE
PERFECTLY
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
MUHAMMAD
SAW
THIS
AUTHORITY
IS
TO
BE
FOUND
IN
HIM
WITH
MORE
CERTANITY
THAN
ALL
THE
OTHER
PROPHETS
TO
BE
CONTINUED
