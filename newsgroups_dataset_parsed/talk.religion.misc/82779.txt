RE
BHAGAVADGITA
KALKI
DASA
WRITES
THESE
TOPICS
ARE
ALL
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
VEDAS
IN
FACT
THE
ORIGINAL
KNOWLEDGE
OF
ALL
THESE
TOPICS
COMES
FROM
THE
VEDAS
THEREFORE
THEY
ARE
NOT
NEWAGE
AT
ALL
THEY
ARE
RATHER
OLD
BY
ANY
STANDARDS
NOR
IS
THE
POPULARITY
THEY
ARE
CURRENTLY
EXPERIENCING
SOMETHING
NEW
ONE
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THE
VEDAS
WOULD
BE
VERY
POPULAR
AMONG
NEWAGERS
SINCE
ALL
THE
THINGS
YOU
MENTION
ABOVE
ARE
THOROUGHLY
DESCRIBED
IN
THEM
ISNT
THAT
INTERESTING
IN
THE
JEWISH
TRADITION
YOU
ARE
INCREDIBLY
WRONG
THEY
ORIGINATE
IN
THE
TORAH
AND
WITH
JEWISH
ANCESTORS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
PATRIARCH
ABRAHAM
ZL
THAT
KNOWLEDGE
WAS
SENT
EAST
TO
INDIA
AND
CHINA
WHEN
ABRAHAM
GAVE
GIFTS
THE
COMMENTATORS
TO
JEWISH
SCRIPTURE
SAY
THIS
WAS
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
OCCULT
ARTS
TO
ALL
THE
REST
OF
HIS
CHILDREN
WHEN
HE
SENT
THEM
AWAY
TO
THE
EAST
THIS
ASSURED
THAT
ISAAC
ONLY
WHO
REMAINED
WITH
ABRAHAM
WOULD
INHERIT
HIS
MOST
IMPORTANT
SPIRITUAL
GIFTS
WHAT
EVENTUALLY
BECAME
JUDAISM
SO
YOU
SEE
OTHER
RELIGIONS
CAN
HAVE
VERY
PAROCHIAL
VIEWS
TOO
BY
THE
JEWISH
VIEW
YOU
ARE
VERY
MISTAKEN
YOUR
SCRIPTURE
ARE
NOT
SCRIPTURE
YOUR
GODS
ARE
NOT
GODS
YOUR
PRACTICES
A
JUMBLE
OF
ERRORS
THAT
LEAD
PEOPLE
TO
IDOL
WORSHIP
AND
AWAY
FROM
GOD
THAT
DOESNT
STOP
US
FROM
RESPECTING
YOU
TO
THE
EXTENT
OF
NOT
TRYING
TO
CONVERT
YOU
OR
PROSELYTIZE
YOU
AND
BEING
WILLING
TO
DIALOG
IN
A
RESPECTFUL
MANNER
WERE
CONTENT
TO
LET
YOU
LIVE
THE
WAY
YOU
CARE
TO
LIVE
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
LEAVE
US
BE
WE
ARE
HAPPY
TO
COEXIST
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
GIVE
US
THE
SAME
RIGHT
BUT
YOUR
INCREDIBLE
RUDENESS
AND
VIOLENT
NATURE
SEEMS
TO
PRECLUDE
THAT
TOO
BAD
IS
THIS
TYPICAL
OF
YOUR
RELIGION
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
ONE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
NEWAGE
PRACTITIONER
AND
THE
ACTUAL
FOLLOWER
OF
THE
VEDIC
TEACHINGS
THE
TYPICAL
NEWAGER
DESIRES
TO
ACQUIRE
ALL
THE
MATERIAL
POWERS
AND
OPULENCES
MENTIONED
IN
THE
VEDAS
WITHOUT
REFERRING
TO
THEIR
SOURCE
THE
LORD
HE
WANTS
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
WITHOUT
GOD
HE
WANTS
PERSONAL
POWER
WITHOUT
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
ACKNOWLEDGING
ITS
SOURCE
WITHOUT
THE
PERSON
FROM
WHOM
THAT
POWER
COMES
IN
OTHER
WORDS
HE
IS
JUST
PLAIN
SELFISH
YOU
ARE
A
MOST
PRESUMPTUOUS
FELLOW
HOW
DARE
YOU
PRESUME
THAT
THE
TYPICAL
NEW
AGER
DOESNT
ACKNOWLEDGE
GOD
AND
IS
SELFISH
WHAT
TRITE
SELFRIGHTEOUS
EGOFUL
GARBAGE
THERE
ARE
BUDDHISTS
CHRISTIANS
JEWS
AND
THOSE
OF
MANY
OTHER
RELIGIONS
HERE
ON
THIS
NEWSGROUPS
FOR
WHOM
YOUR
WORDS
ARE
SIMPLE
SLANDER
THE
VEDIC
FOLLOWER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
KNOWS
THAT
NO
MATTER
WHAT
ONE
DESIRES
ONE
MUST
WORSHIP
GOD
AND
THE
VEDAS
GIVE
A
COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION
OF
EXACTLY
WHO
IS
GOD
SO
THAT
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
MISTAKE
IN
HIS
IDENTIFICATION
FOR
THIS
REASON
THE
PARTS
OF
THE
VEDAS
THAT
DEAL
DIRECTLY
WITH
THE
PERSONALITY
OF
GODHEAD
ARE
NOT
VERY
POPULAR
AMONG
NEWAGERS
AND
ANYONE
WHO
PRESENTS
THE
COMPLETE
VEDAS
AS
THEY
ARE
IS
BRANDED
AS
AN
EVANGELIST
AS
IF
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
WRONG
WITH
THAT
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
IS
SIMPLY
PRESENTING
THE
UNADULTERATED
VEDIC
TEACHINGS
OF
COURSE
FROM
THE
JEWISH
PERSPECTIVE
YOU
ARE
INCREDIBLY
WRONG
WED
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
GODHEAD
JUST
CREATED
BEINGS
WHO
MAY
BE
ENJOYING
A
GOOD
LAUGH
AT
YOUR
EXPENSE
A
THIEF
TAKES
FROM
OTHERS
AND
SAYS
THIS
IS
MINE
A
NEWAGER
TAKES
FROM
GOD
AND
SAYS
THIS
IS
MINE
SUCH
A
FALSE
MYSTIC
MUST
BE
CAREFUL
TO
AVOID
COMING
IN
CONTACT
WITH
THE
REAL
OWNER
OF
THE
THINGS
HE
HAS
STOLEN
CONSEQUENTLY
HE
INVENTS
AN
EXPLANATION
FOR
THESE
THINGS
THAT
CONVENIENTLY
OMITS
THE
IDENTITY
OF
THEIR
OWNER
THE
LORD
IN
OTHER
WORDS
HE
LIES
ABOUT
WHERE
HE
GOT
THEM
SO
NOT
ONLY
ARE
WE
SELFISH
WE
ARE
ALSO
THIEVES
AND
LIARS
AND
YOU
EXPECT
ANY
OF
US
TO
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
YOU
AND
YOUR
RELIGION
WHY
NOT
CALL
US
MORE
NAME
MAYBE
THEN
WELL
ALL
CONVERT
IN
GRATEFULLNESS
HOWEVER
THE
LORD
IS
VERY
MERCIFUL
AND
HE
SENDS
HIS
SERVANTS
TO
REMIND
THE
NEWAGER
OF
HIS
OWN
IDENTITY
AS
SPIRIT
SOUL
THE
ETERNAL
SERVANT
OF
GOD
HENCE
ALTHOUGH
UNWANTED
THE
EVANGELIST
CONTINUES
TO
BROADCAST
THE
COMPLETE
TRUTH
YOU
DELUDE
YOURSELF
