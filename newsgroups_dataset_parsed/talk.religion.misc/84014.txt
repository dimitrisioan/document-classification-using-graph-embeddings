for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
i
assume
you
have
evidence
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
again
id
like
to
see
some
evidence
nut
or
not
he
was
clearly
a
liar
he
said
he
would
surrender
after
local
radio
stations
broadcast
his
message
but
he
didnt
then
he
said
he
would
surrender
after
passover
but
he
didnt
none
of
which
excuses
the
gross
incompetence
and
disregard
for
the
safety
of
the
children
displayed
by
the
feds
as
someone
else
pointed
out
if
it
had
been
chelsea
clinton
in
there
you
would
probably
have
seen
more
restraint
