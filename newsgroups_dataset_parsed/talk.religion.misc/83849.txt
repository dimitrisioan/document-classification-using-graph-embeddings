question
is
on
what
authority
do
we
proclaim
that
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
commandment
are
no
longer
relevant
to
modern
christians
please
i
dont
believe
most
christians
believe
they
are
above
the
law
however
we
are
not
saved
by
adherence
to
the
law
the
law
exists
to
tell
us
what
is
sinful
we
all
sin
hence
we
are
all
above
the
law
where
all
in
this
case
refers
to
christians
jews
believe
that
their
sins
are
atoned
for
with
blood
sacrifice
of
animals
as
described
in
the
old
testament
when
was
the
last
time
you
heard
about
a
jewish
animal
sacrifice
christians
believe
that
their
sins
are
atoned
for
by
the
blood
sacrifice
of
jesus
the
blood
sacrifice
of
an
innocent
man
this
does
not
make
the
law
irrelevant
then
why
dont
christians
follow
it
why
dont
they
even
follow
their
own
ten
commandments
breaking
the
law
is
sinful
and
we
are
to
avoid
sinful
ways
but
sinning
by
itself
does
not
jeopardize
salvation
so
in
short
hitler
is
in
heaven
and
gandhi
is
in
hell
note
that
im
not
a
theologian
but
this
is
the
gist
of
several
sermons
ive
heard
lately
and
some
bible
studies
ive
been
through
did
you
ever
wonder
if
someone
perhaps
a
great
deceiver
was
pulling
your
leg
