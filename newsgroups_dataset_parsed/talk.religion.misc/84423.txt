ON
JOSEPHUS
INSERTS
THANKS
AM
I
CORRECT
THEN
IN
ASSUMING
THAT
THAT
JOSEPHUS
DID
IN
FACT
WRITE
ABOUT
JESUS
BUT
CHRISTIAN
COPISTS
EMBELLISHED
IT
JACK
THAT
IS
INDEED
THE
PRESENT
CONSENSUS
CONTRARY
TO
WHAT
DR
FOX
HAS
BEEN
SAYING
HOWEVER
PRESENT
CONSENSUS
IS
NOT
THAT
THE
LONGER
PASSAGE
IN
JOSEPHUS
ABOUT
JESUS
WAS
INSERTED
BUT
ONLY
THAT
IT
WAS
MODIFIED
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
IT
WAS
AT
LEAST
MODIFIED
BASED
ON
WHAT
ORIGEN
SAYSTHAT
JOSEPHUS
DID
NOT
RECOGNIZE
JESUS
AS
THE
MESSIAH
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
IT
APPEARS
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
ONE
I
HAVENT
LOOKED
AT
THE
CONTEXT
FOR
A
WHILE
PERHAPS
SOMEBODY
COULD
GIVE
SOME
OF
THE
SENTENCES
WHICH
PRECEDE
AND
FOLLOW
THE
JESUS
PASSAGE
