lamb
mithraist
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
bull
if
anyone
in
netland
is
in
the
process
of
devising
a
new
religion
do
not
use
the
lamb
or
the
bull
because
they
have
already
been
reserved
please
choose
another
animal
preferably
one
not
on
the
endangered
species
list
this
will
be
a
hard
task
because
most
cultures
used
most
animals
for
blood
sacrifices
it
has
to
be
something
related
to
our
current
postmodernism
state
hmm
what
about
