re
after
years
can
we
say
that
christian
morality
is
frank

writes
plus
questions
for
you
why
do
subjectivistsrelativistsnihilists
get
so
het
up
about
the
idea
that
relativism
is
better
than
objectivism
to
the
degree
that
relativism
is
a
more
accurate
decription
of
the
truth
than
is
objectivism
it
provides
more
power
and
ability
to
control
events
assuming
for
the
moment
that
morals
are
relative
then
two
relativists
can
recognize
that
neither
has
a
lock
on
the
absolute
truth
and
they
can
proceed
to
negotiate
a
workable
compromise
that
produces
the
desired
results
assuming
that
there
is
an
absolute
morality
two
disagreeing
objectivists
can
either
be
both
wrong
or
just
one
of
them
right
there
is
no
room
for
compromise
once
you
beleive
in
absolute
morals
you
must
accept
that
you
are
amoral
or
that
everyone
who
disagrees
with
you
is
amoral
given
a
choice
between
a
peaceful
compromise
or
endless
contention
id
say
that
compromise
seems
to
be
better
