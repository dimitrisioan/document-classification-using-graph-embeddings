RE
JUDAS
CRUCIFIXION
TYRE
ETC
FRANK
DECENSO
I
NEED
TO
PRIORITIZE
THINGS
IN
MY
LIFE
AND
THIS
BOARD
IS
NOT
ALL
THAT
IMPORTANT
TO
ME
OF
COURSE
IT
IS
IT
FORMS
A
VERY
BIG
PART
OF
YOUR
SELFRESPECT
YOU
COME
ONTO
THE
BOARD
THINKING
YOURE
SOME
SORT
OF
APOLOGETICIST
FOR
YOUR
FAITH
AND
YOU
ROUTINELY
GET
ROASTED
OVER
A
GRILL
FOR
STUPID
THEORIES
AND
UNFOUNDED
ASSUMPTIONS
FRANK
DECENSO
THIS
BOARD
WILL
HAVE
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
IF
EVER
I
CAN
ORGANIZE
MY
LIFE
TO
FIT
IT
IN
I
TRIED
DROPPING
OUT
BUT
SIEFERMAN
COERCED
ME
TO
COME
BACK
HE
WONT
THIS
TIME
I
DOUBT
THAT
SIEFERMAN
HAS
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
YOU
DROPPING
OUT
ITS
PROBABLY
CLOSER
TO
THE
TRUTH
TO
SAY
THAT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
THE
CARDS
TO
PLAY
IN
THIS
GAME
BECAUSE
YOU
INSIST
ON
PLAYING
FROM
A
LOSING
HAND
AND
YOURE
FINALLY
REALIZING
IT
YOU
WILL
LURK
ON
THE
BOARD
AND
KEEP
QUIET
FOR
A
WHILE
LOOKING
FOR
AN
AREA
WHERE
YOU
ARE
CERTAIN
THAT
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
AND
THEN
WELL
SEE
YOU
POP
BACK
IN
AGAIN
OF
COURSE
YOU
THEN
WILL
SAY
THAT
YOU
HAVE
MERELY
RETURNED
BECAUSE
YOUR
LIFE
IS
NOW
IN
ORDER
BUT
WELL
KNOW
BETTER
