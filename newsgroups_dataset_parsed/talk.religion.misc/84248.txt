hmm
it
seems
that
this
is
the
core
of
christianity
then
you
have
to
feel
guilty
i
think
i
see
where
you
are
coming
from
kent
jesus
doesnt
view
guilt
like
our
modern
venacular
colors
it
feelings
have
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
feelings
arise
from
the
state
of
being
guilty
feeling
and
guilt
are
mutally
exclusive
feelings
are
a
reaction
from
guilt
jesus
is
talking
about
the
guilt
state
not
the
reaction
let
me
give
you
an
example
have
you
ever
made
a
mistake
have
you
ever
lied
to
someone
even
a
little
white
lie
have
you
ever
claimed
to
know
something
that
you
really
didnt
know
have
you
ever
hated
someone
have
you
ever
been
selfish
are
you
guilty
of
any
one
of
these
the
answer
is
of
course
yes
you
are
guilty
period
that
is
it
what
jesus
is
getting
at
no
big
surprise
feelings
do
not
even
enter
the
picture
consider
jesuss
use
of
the
word
guilt
as
how
a
court
uses
it
ive
done
all
those
things
and
ive
regretted
it
and
i
learned
a
lesson
or
two
so
far
an
aspirin
a
good
talk
with
your
wife
or
a
one
week
vacation
has
cured
me
no
need
for
group
therapy
or
strange
religions
