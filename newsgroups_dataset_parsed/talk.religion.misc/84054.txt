science
the
real
world
has
its
basis
in
values
not
the
other
way
round
as
you
would
wish
it
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
objective
value
then
science
can
not
objectively
be
said
to
be
more
useful
than
a
kick
in
the
head
simple
theories
with
accurate
predictions
could
not
objectively
be
said
to
be
more
useful
than
a
set
of
tarot
cards
you
like
those
conclusions
i
dont
i
think
that
you
are
changing
the
meaning
of
values
here
perhaps
it
is
time
to
backtrack
and
take
a
look
at
the
word
value
n
a
fair
equivalent
or
return
for
something
such
as
goods
or
service
monetary
or
material
worth
worth
as
measured
in
usefulness
or
importance
merit
a
principle
standard
or
quality
considered
inherently
worthwhile
or
desirable
precise
meaning
as
of
a
word
an
assigned
or
calculated
numerical
quantity
mus
the
relative
duratation
of
a
tone
or
rest
the
relative
darkness
or
lightness
of
a
color
the
distinctive
quality
of
a
speech
or
speech
sound
in
context
of
a
moral
system
definition
four
seems
to
fit
best
in
terms
of
scientific
usage
definitions
six
or
eight
might
apply
note
that
these
definitions
do
not
mean
the
same
thing
no
im
using
definition
or
perhaps
in
both
cases
if
there
is
no
objective
worth
usefulness
or
importance
then
science
has
no
objective
worth
usefulness
or
importance
if
nothing
is
inherently
worthwhile
or
desirable
then
simple
theories
with
accurate
predictions
are
not
inherently
worthwhile
or
desirable
do
you
see
any
flaws
in
this
the
problem
is
your
use
of
the
word
objective
along
with
values
both
definitions
three
and
four
are
inherently
subjective
that
is
they
are
particular
to
a
given
individual
or
personal
you
see
what
one
person
may
see
as
worthwhile
another
may
see
as
worthless
if
on
the
other
hand
some
things
have
objective
worth
usefulness
or
importance
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
they
are
again
your
form
of
measurement
in
this
sentence
that
being
of
worth
is
subjective
if
you
can
provide
an
objective
foundation
for
morality
then
that
will
be
a
good
beginning
im
not
willing
to
attempt
this
until
someone
provides
an
objective
basis
for
the
notion
that
science
is
useful
worthy
or
important
in
dealing
with
observed
facts
alternatively
you
could
try
to
demonstrate
to
me
that
science
is
not
necessarily
useful
worthy
or
important
in
any
situation
in
other
words
i
need
to
know
how
you
use
the
term
objective
when
i
find
that
my
usage
of
a
word
is
different
than
the
usage
of
that
word
given
by
another
person
i
try
to
find
a
standard
against
which
to
judge
that
usage
in
most
cases
the
dictionary
is
the
standard
i
use
here
is
a
definiton
of
objective
objective
adj
of
or
having
to
do
with
a
material
object
as
distinguished
from
a
mental
concept
having
actual
existance
unenfluenced
by
emotion
or
personal
prejudice
b
based
on
observable
phenomenon
by
this
definition
science
does
not
have
an
objective
worth
since
the
phrase
objective
worth
is
an
oxymoron
however
you
asked
something
a
little
differently
this
time
you
asked
for
an
objective
basis
for
a
notion
the
fact
that
the
use
of
science
as
an
intellectual
tool
is
responsible
for
changes
in
our
world
the
changes
are
material
and
thus
objective
would
provide
an
objective
basis
for
an
argument
however
the
conclusion
arrived
at
from
that
argument
that
science
is
good
is
subjective
i
think
that
the
problem
here
is
one
of
word
usage
take
a
little
time
and
read
the
definitions
of
these
words
objective
subjective
worth
value
morality
good
evil
i
believe
that
if
you
think
about
the
meaning
of
them
for
a
while
you
will
have
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
objective
morality
