WHOS
NEXT
MORMONS
AND
JEWS
DAVID
CHARLAP
WRITES
SOMEONE
IN
THE
GOVERNMENT
ACTUALLY
BELIEVED
KORESH
KNEW
THE
SEVEN
SEALS
OF
THE
APOCALYPSE
AND
ORDERED
THE
INVASION
SO
THAT
THEYD
ALL
BE
DEAD
AND
UNABLE
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THEM
IN
PUBLIC
EVERYTHING
WE
NEED
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
SEVEN
SEALS
IS
ALREADY
IN
THE
BIBLE
THERE
IS
NO
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
SEALS
THAT
KORESH
COULD
HAVE
UNLESS
THE
FBI
WERE
TO
KILL
ALL
PUBLISHERS
OF
THE
BIBLE
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THE
STORY
OF
THE
SEVEN
SEALS
WOULD
BE
BOUND
TO
LEAK
OUT
ASSUMING
FOR
THE
MOMENT
THAT
THE
FBI
BELIEVED
IN
THE
BIBLE
AND
WERE
AFRAID
OF
THE
SEVEN
SEALS
THEN
THEY
WOULD
ALSO
KNOW
THAT
GOD
IS
THE
ONE
WHO
HAS
TO
OPEN
THE
SEALS
NOT
SOME
LITTLE
PROPHET
LIKE
KORESH
