the

that
you
do

not

im
curious
about
this
statement
is
it
a
known
understanding
amongst
christian
believers
that
people
who
dont
understand
the
christian
doctrines
are
enjoying
this
state
i
come
from
a
background
with
a
heavy
christian
teaching
lutheran
church
and
consider
myself
knowledgeable
with
the
basic
understandings
of
christianity
at
the
same
time
im
not
proud
of
things
i
dont
understand
or
know
of
at
this
point
of
time
ignorance
is
not
bliss
