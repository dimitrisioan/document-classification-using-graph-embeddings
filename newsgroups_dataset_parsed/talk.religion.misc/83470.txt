article
student
writes
hmmmm
define
objective
morality
well
depends
upon
who
you
talk
to
some
say
it
means
you
cant
have
your
hair
over
your
ears
and
others
say
it
means
stryper
is
acceptable
i
would
say
that
general
principles
of
objective
morality
would
be
listed
in
one
or
two
places
ten
commandments
sayings
of
jesus
the
first
depends
on
whether
you
trust
the
bible
the
second
depends
on
both
whether
you
think
jesus
is
god
and
whether
you
think
we
have
accurate
copies
of
the
nt
gong
take
a
moment
and
look
at
what
you
just
wrote
first
you
defined
an
objective
morality
and
then
you
qualified
this
objective
morality
with
subjective
justifications
do
you
see
the
error
in
this
sorry
you
have
just
disqualified
yourself
but
please
play
again
