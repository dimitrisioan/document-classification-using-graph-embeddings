MY
HOPE
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
LOOK
AND
WILL
SEE
THE
RAMIFICATIONS
OF
THE
TRUCK
COMING
TOWARDS
HIM
MY
HOPE
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
WANT
TO
STEP
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
MY
FEAR
THOUGH
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
INSTEAD
CHOOSE
TO
GLUE
HIMSELF
TO
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
HIGHWAY
WHERE
HE
WILL
CERTAINLY
GET
RUN
OVER
BUT
IF
HE
SO
CHOOSES
HE
SO
CHOOSES
AND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
I
CAN
DO
BEYOND
THAT
TO
CHANGE
HIS
MIND
FOR
IT
IS
HIS
CHOICE
BUT
AT
THIS
VERY
MOMENT
BRIAN
HASNT
GOTTEN
EVEN
THAT
FAR
HE
IS
STILL
AT
THE
POINT
WHERE
HE
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
LOOK
SURE
HE
MOVES
HIS
EYEBALL
TO
APPEASE
ME
BUT
HIS
HEAD
WILL
NOT
TURN
AROUND
TO
SEE
THE
ENTIRE
PICTURE
SO
FAR
HE
IS
SATISFIED
WITH
HIS
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
MOUNTAINS
OFF
IN
THE
DISTANCE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
YOU
IMAGINE
HIM
INSIDE
THIS
HUGE
WALL
UNABLE
TO
SEE
REALITY
WHILE
HE
IMAGINES
THE
SAME
ABOUT
YOU
CLEARLY
WE
HAVE
A
CASE
WHERE
RELATIVITY
PLAYS
A
BIG
ROLE
CONCERNING
LOOKING
AT
OPPOSITE

REALITY
