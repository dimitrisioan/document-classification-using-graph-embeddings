WRITES
BE
WARNED
IT
IS
NOT
MY
JOB
TO
CONVERT
YOU
THAT
IS
THE
JOB
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
AND
I
FRANKLY
MAKE
A
LOUSY
ONE
I
AM
ONLY
HERE
TO
TESTIFY
YOUR
CONVERSION
IS
BETWEEN
YOU
AND
GOD
I
AM
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
IF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
FOLLOW
JESUS
OF
WHICH
I
INDEED
WOULD
BE
ESTATIC
THEN
ALL
THE
GLORY
BE
TO
GOD
IVE
ASKED
YOUR
GOD
SEVERAL
TIMES
WITH
ALL
MY
HEART
TO
COME
TO
ME
I
REALLY
WISH
I
COULD
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
COS
NO
MATTER
HOW
MUCH
CONFIDENCE
I
BUILD
UP
ON
MY
OWN
THE
UNIVERSE
IS
A
BIG
PLACE
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
SO
NICE
TO
KNOW
I
HAVE
SOMEONE
WATCHING
OVER
ME
IN
IT
IVE
GONE
INTO
THIS
WITH
AN
OPEN
MIND
IVE
LAYED
MY
BELIEFS
ASIDE
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
WHEN
IVE
HAD
DOUBT
AND
IVE
PRAYED
TO
SEE
WHAT
GOOD
THAT
WOULD
DO
I
DONT
SEE
WHAT
MORE
I
CAN
DO
TO
OPEN
MYSELF
TO
YOUR
GOD
SHORT
OF
JUST
DECIDING
TO
BELIEVE
FOR
NO
GOOD
REASON
AND
IF
I
DECIDE
TO
BELIEVE
FOR
NO
GOOD
REASON
WHY
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
SOME
OTHER
GOD
ZEUS
SEEMS
LIKE
A
PRETTY
COOL
CANDIDATE
ALL
I
KNOW
IS
THAT
IN
ALL
MY
SEARCHING
EVEN
THOUGH
IVE
SET
ASIDE
MY
PRIDE
AND
DECIDED
THAT
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
NO
MATTER
HOW
DIFFICULT
IT
MAY
BE
TO
ACCEPT
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
ANY
ENCOUNTER
WITH
ANY
DEITY
CHRISTIAN
OR
OTHERWISE
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHAT
MORE
I
CAN
DO
WHILE
STILL
REMAINING
