PART
AND
PART
RE
HOMOSEXUALITY
TONY
I
READ
YOUR
POST
IT
WAS
NOTHING
NEW
I
HAD
SEEN
MUCH
THE
SAME
IN
OTHER
TYPICALCHRISTIAN
ANTIGAY
SENTIMENTAL
LITERATURE
GAY
PEOPLE
ARE
AND
WILL
CON
TINUE
TO
BE
PERSECUTED
AS
LONG
AS
SUCH
PROPAGANDA
PETPETUATES
YOU
MAY
BE
UNAWARE
OF
ALL
THE
STATISTICA
FINDINGS
CONCERNING
AFRICANAMERICANS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
PUBLISHED
AND
USED
BY
VARIOUS
GROUPS
TO
REENFORCE
THEIR
OWN
BIAS
AGAINST
AFRICANAMERICANS
WE
USUALLY
THINK
OF
THE
KKK
IN
THESE
INSTANCES
BUT
THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHER
GROUPS
OF
COURSE
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
THE
PUBLIC
SCOFF
AT
SUCH
FINDINGS
AND
DOCUMENTS
TODAY
BUT
THAT
WAS
NOT
ALWAYS
THE
CASE
FORTUNATELY
AFRICANAMERICANS
HAD
WHITES
WHO
SUPPORTED
THEIR
CAUSE
AND
PUBLIC
SENTIMENT
WAS
EVENTUALLY
IF
NOT
ENTIRELY
TURNED
AROUND
THERE
WAS
EVEN
A
CIVIL
WAR
AND
ANTINEGRO
SENTIMENT
INCREASED
IN
FACT
UNTIL
LAWS
WERE
PUT
IN
PLACE
TO
PROTECT
THE
INALIENABLE
RIGHTS
OF
BLACKS
IT
WAS
PRETTY
MUCH
LEGAL
TO
DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST
THEM
I
KNOW
MANY
GAYS
AND
I
WILL
NOT
TURN
MY
BACK
ON
THEM
OR
THEIR
RIGHT
TO
BE
FREE
FORM
DISCRIMINATION
YOU
MAY
THINK
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
DECEIVED
OR
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
YOUR
PEROGATIVE
MY
CHURCH
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
DISCIPLES
OF
CHRIST
OPENLY
AFFIRMS
THE
RIGHTS
OF
OPPRESSED
PEOPLE
OF
ALL
SEGMENTS
OF
SOCIETY
INCLUDING
GAYS
WE
BELIEVE
THE
GOSPEL
MESSAGE
OF
PREACHING
TO
ALL
CREATION
AND
MAKING
DISCIPLES
WE
BELIEVE
IN
THE
LORDS
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
TO
LOVE
AND
WE
BELEIVE
IN
STANDING
UP
FOR
THE
OPPRESSED
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
NOT
POPULAR
TO
DO
SO
I
REALLY
LIKE
MY
CHURCH
FOR
LAST
REASON
THE
MOST
I
CAN
FIND
A
CHURCH
ALMOST
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
VALLEY
THAT
STANDS
FOR
THE
GOSPEL
AND
BELIEVES
IN
THE
COMMANDMENT
OF
LOVE
THOUGH
IM
HARDPRESSED
TO
FIND
MANY
WHO
ACTUALLY
SHO
LOVE
BUT
NOT
MANY
ARE
WILLING
TO
CHAMPION
THE
OPPRESSED
ESPECIALLY
WITHIN
THEIR
OWN
COMMUNITY
I
MAY
HAVE
LOST
FACE
WITH
THE
GREATER
CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY
FOR
THE
UNPOPULARITY
OF
MY
BELIEFS
BUT
SO
DID
THE
ABOLITIONISTS
AGAINST
THE
OPPRESSION
OF
AFRICANAMERICANS
MANY
WERE
EVEN
KILLED
AND
TREATED
AS
RUNAWAY
SLAVES
FOR
BEING
NIGGERLOVERS
AND
SUCH
I
GUESS
IVE
DECIDED
THE
CHALLENGE
IS
WORTH
IT
IN
MY
TALKS
WITH
GAY
MEN
AND
WOMEN
I
HAVE
HEARD
TRAGIC
STORY
AFTER
TRAGIC
STORY
CENTERING
AROUND
FAILED
MARRIAGES
WIVES
AND
HUSBANDS
WHO
ARE
STRAIGHT
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
HURT
IN
THE
PROCESS
ETC
FUNNY
THING
IS
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
ONE
CASE
WHERE
THE
PARENTS
EXWIVES
OR
EVEN
CHILDREN
HAVE
CONTINUED
TO
REJECT
THEIR
GAY
FAMILY
MEMBER
SON
DAUGHTER
EXHUSBAND
FATHER
ETC
AFTER
THEY
BEGAN
TO
TAKE
PART
IN
SOME
FORM
OF
SUPPORT
GROUP
LIKE
PFLAG
IM
APALLED
BY
THE
LEGISLATION
WHICH
PASSED
IN
COLORADO
AND
AM
EQUALLY
RAGED
THAT
SUCH
SLIMEY
PEOPLE
AS
LOUIS
SHELDON
FROM
THE
TRADITION
VALUES
COALITION
HAVE
BEEN
ACTIVELY
WORKING
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
UNDERGROUND
TO
GARNER
SUPPORT
WITHIN
SEVERAL
I
BELIEVE
STATES
THIS
COMING
NOVEMBER
FOR
MORE
OPPRESSIVE
LEGISATION
AGAINST
GAYS
PERHAPS
YOU
DONT
GET
IT
AND
MAYBE
YOU
NEVER
WILL
MANY
DIDNT
GET
IT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AGES
AND
THE
PROCLAIMED
GODS
WILL
BE
DONE
AS
THEY
MASSACRED
THOUSANDS
IN
WITCH
HUNTS
AND
INQUISITIONS
THE
MESSAGE
THAT
COMES
THROUGH
LOUD
AND
CLEAR
BY
PROPONENTS
AGAINST
GAY
RIGHTS
AND
AGAINST
GAYS
IN
GENERAL
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
A
STRONG
DISLIKE
EVEN
HATRED
FOR
GAYS
WHETHER
YOU
WANT
TO
CALL
IT
SUCH
OR
NOT
IT
DOESNT
CHANGE
THE
RESULTS
THE
MAJOR
FLAW
IN
ALL
THIS
POSTURING
IS
THAT
IN
THE
END
THE
FINAL
EFFECT
OF
POSTS
LIKE
THAT
OF
YOURS
AND
MR
HUDSON
IS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
CONDITIONAL
LOVE
FOR
GAYS
CONDITION
CHANGE
AND
WELL
LOVE
YOU
THIS
IS
SURE
STRANGE
COMING
FROM
A
GROUP
WHO
CLAIM
THAT
GOD
HAS
AN
UNCONDITIONAL
LOVE
ONE
THAT
CALLS
PEOPLE
JUST
AS
THEY
ARE
SURE
THERE
ARE
THINGS
THAT
WILL
NATURALLY
CHANGE
AND
HABITS
LIKE
ALCOHOLISM
WIFE
BEATING
ETC
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
CHANGED
THROUGH
SOME
SORT
OF
THERAPY
BUT
THEN
THERE
ARE
THINGS
LIKE
LEFTHANDEDNESS
ETC
THAT
NO
AMOUNT
OF
BEATING
IT
OUT
OF
PEOPLE
IS
GOING
TO
RESULT
IN
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
AN
OUTWARD
CONFORMINTY
TO
OTHER
PEOPLES
EXPECTATIONS
IN
THE
PROCESS
THIS
COERCED
CONFORMITY
CAUSES
MANY
PEOPLE
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
HARM
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
IT
IS
CAUSED
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
NOTHING
MORE
TO
GAIN
FROM
IT
THAT
TO
BECOME
EVEN
MORE
PUFFED
UP
ABOUT
THEIR
OWN
SENSE
OF
PSEUPERSPIRITUALITY
THIS
IS
SAD
BUT
I
THOROUGHLY
BELIEVE
THAT
ONE
DAY
IT
WILL
CHANGE
IT
MAY
BE
UNPOPULAR
TO
CRY
FOR
JUSTICE
AND
EQUALITY
WHEN
THE
BASIS
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
SOMETHING
VERY
PERSONAL
LIKE
SEXUALITY
A
TABOO
SUBJECT
EVEN
TODAY
BUT
I
FIRMLY
BELIEVE
IN
THE
RIGHTS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
TO
BE
FREE
FROM
IMPOSE
REGULATION
ON
THIER
BEDROOMS
ITS
FUNNY
THAT
MOST
STRAIGHT
PEOPLE
HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY
REMOVED
RESTRICTIVE
AND
OPPRESSIVE
LEGISLATION
AGAINST
INVASIVE
LEGISLATION
BUT
WE
LIKE
TO
MAINTAIN
THIS
LITTLE
CHESTNUT
OF
REPRESSIONAS
THOUGH
IT
HELPS
US
MAINTAIN
A
SENSE
OF
SUPERIORITY
OVER
AT
LEAST
ONE
SEGMENT
OF
SOCIETY
GAY
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
CRIMINALS
ANOTHER
INTERESTING
THING
HAPPENED
RECENTLY
A
VERY
PROMINENT
CHARISMATIC
CHURCH
IN
THE
SILICON
VALLEY
HERE
HAD
TWO
OF
ITS
PASTORS
ARRESTED
FOR
SELF
ADMITTED
CHARGES
OF
PEDERASTY
MEN
HAVING
SEX
WITH
BOYS
THIS
HAD
APPARENTLY
BEEN
GOING
ON
FOR
SOME
TIME
A
COUPLE
YEARS
BUT
SINCE
THE
CHARGES
WERE
VOLUNTARY
AND
THE
CHURCH
WORKED
CLOSELY
WITH
THE
POLICE
SO
I
IMAGINE
THAT
WAS
HOW
THEY
MANAGED
TO
DOWNPLAY
IT
IN
THE
MEDIA
HOW
COULD
SUCH
A
THING
HAPPEN
WHEN
THE
CHURCH
ITSELF
HAS
AN
EXGAY
MINISTRY
ONE
OF
MY
FRIENDS
RECENTLY
TOLD
ME
HE
WAS
APPROACHED
BY
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
GOING
THROUGH
THE
REPARITIVE
THERAPY
THERE
AND
HE
WAS
THOROUGHLY
CONVINCED
THAT
THE
REQUEST
FOR
DINNER
WAS
NOT
AN
INVITATION
TO
ATTEND
THE
MINISTRY
THESE
ARE
DIFFICULT
TIMES
WE
LIVE
IN
BUT
PROVIDING
HOSTILE
ENVIRONMENTS
AND
CREATING
AND
PERPETUATING
AN
ATMOSPHERE
THAT
BREED
HATE
AND
VIOLENCE
IS
NOT
THE
CALL
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
PASSING
AMENDMENT
IN
COLORADO
HAS
CREATED
AN
ORGANIZATION
WHOS
POSTERS
ARE
APPEARING
ALL
OVER
COLORADO
CALLED
STRAIGHT
I
FORGET
THE
WHOLE
DEFINITION
OFF
HAND
BUT
THE
LAST
PART
WAS
AGAINST
IMMORAL
GROSS
HOMOSEXUAL
TRASH
AND
THEIR
MOTTO
IS
WORKING
FOR
A
FAGFREE
AMERICA
WITH
AN
IMPLICIT
ADVOCATION
FOR
VIOLENCE
THIS
IS
SICK
AND
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
WHAT
YOU
AND
MR
HUDSON
AND
OTHERS
ARE
EMBRACING
WE
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
A
LOOOOOOOOOONG
TRADITION
OF
COERSION
AND
OPPRESSION
TOWARDS
THOSE
WE
FEEL
DONT
MEASURE
UP
AND
CONSTANT
BERATEMENT
FROM
ORGANIZATIONS
LIKE
THE
CHRISTIAN
RESEARCH
INSTITUTE
WHILE
THEY
DO
HAVE
A
GOOD
PURPOSE
ALSO
THEIR
MAJOR
WORK
SEEMS
TO
BE
FINDING
NEW
AND
BETTER
WAYS
OF
EXCLUDING
PEOPLE
THE
GOSPEL
I
BELIEVE
IS
NOT
SO
NEGATIVE
RATHER
IT
SEEKS
WAYS
TO
INCLUDE
PEOPLE
I
HAVE
SEVERAL
OF
DR
MARTINS
BOOKS
AND
FIND
THEM
QUITE
HELPFUL
ESPECIALLY
CONCERNING
CULTS
BUT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
CRI
HAS
BECOME
A
CULT
UNTO
ITSELF
WHY
DONT
WE
JUST
STICK
TO
THE
POSITIVE
AND
FIND
WAYS
TO
BRING
PEOPLE
TO
JESUS
ISTEAD
OF
TAKING
BULLWHIPS
AND
DRIVING
THEM
AWAY
WHATEVER
RICH
