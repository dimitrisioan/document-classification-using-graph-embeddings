HOW
CLOSELY
DID

ANALYZE
THE
BIBLE
LOOKS
AS
IF
YOU

WAS
THE

WHO

FOR
YOU
DID
YOU
EVER
DO
WHAT

GREEK
HEBREW
AND
ARAMAIC
IN

TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
CORE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
I
HOPE
YOU
ARE
NOT
CATHOLIC
BECAUSE
MY
CHRISTIAN
UPBRINGING
WAS
BASED
ON
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
LUTHER
AND
THE
ONE
OF
THE
CORE
MESSAGES
WAS
BASICALLY
THAT
YOU
DONT
NEED
TO
KNOW
LATIN
IN
ORDER
TO
LEARN
ABOUT
SALVATION
BTW
YOUR
STATEMENT
WOULD
ALSO
ELIMINATE
ABOUT
