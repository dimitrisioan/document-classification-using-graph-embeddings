to
consecrate
the
major
prophet
daniel
uses
the
word
messiah
in
daniel
chapter
how
closely
did
you
analyze
the
bible
looks
as
if
you
didnt
get
past
the
first
word
so
was
the
catalyst
to
break
your
faith
the
priests
who
interpreted
the
bible
for
you
did
you
ever
do
what
the
bereans
did
to
pauls
teachings
in
acts
brian
does
all
this
mean
that
you
have
to
be
well
versed
in
ancient
greek
hebrew
and
aramaic
in
order
to
understand
the
core
of
christianity
i
hope
you
are
not
catholic
because
my
christian
upbringing
was
based
on
the
teachings
of
luther
and
the
one
of
the
core
messages
was
basically
that
you
dont
need
to
know
latin
in
order
to
learn
about
salvation
btw
your
statement
would
also
eliminate
about
of
all
the
christians
in
the
world
as
well
