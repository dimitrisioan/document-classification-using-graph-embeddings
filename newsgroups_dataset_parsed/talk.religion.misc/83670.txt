if
it
were
a
sin
to
violate
sunday
no
one
could
ever
be
forgiven
for
that
for
jesus
never
kept
sunday
holy
he
only
recognized
one
day
of
the
seven
as
holy
jesus
also
recognized
other
holy
days
like
the
passover
acts
says
that
no
more
should
be
layed
on
the
gentiles
than
that
which
is
necessary
the
sabbath
is
not
in
the
list
nor
do
any
of
the
epistles
instruct
people
to
keep
the
day
while
christians
were
living
among
people
who
did
not
keep
the
day
it
looks
like
that
would
have
been
a
problem
instead
we
have
scriptures
telling
us
that
all
days
can
be
esteemed
alike
romans
and
that
no
man
should
judge
us
in
regard
to
what
kind
of
food
we
eat
jewish
holy
days
we
keep
or
in
regard
to
the
sabbath
col
the
question
is
on
what
authority
do
we
proclaim
that
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
commandment
are
no
longer
relevant
to
modern
christians
i
dont
think
that
the
sabbath
or
any
other
command
of
the
law
is
totally
irrelevant
to
modern
christians
but
what
about
collosions
where
it
says
that
we
are
not
to
be
judged
in
regard
to
the
keeping
of
the
sabbath
