you
have

that
whispers
please
come
back
to
me
im
looking
for
something
in
greenlaurie
morgan
sorry
but
it
doesnt
matter
what
you
think
i
am
a
christian
who
happens
to
belong
to
the
lds
church
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
i
dont
usually
read
trm
it
is
truly
informative
to
stop
by
and
see
that
there
are
still
people
in
the
world
like
those
that
forced
my
ancestors
into
the
deserts
of
utah
and
then
out
of
the
country
entirely
my
grandmother
was
born
in
mexico
where
her
family
had
moved
to
escape
religious
persecution
in
the
us
im
willing
to
admit
that
members
of
other
churches
are
christians
if
they
believe
in
christ
and
try
to
follow
his
teachings
even
though
they
have
different
interpretations
of
the
bible
and
yet
these
other
churches
often
go
out
of
their
way
to
define
whether
or
not
i
am
considered
to
be
christian
could
someone
mail
me
a
set
of
rulesbeliefs
that
must
be
followed
to
be
a
christian
does
this
set
of
rules
exclude
other
large
bodies
of
believers
i
know
this
is
a
waste
of
everyones
time
this
has
probably
been
discussed
n
times
etc
i
guess
im
more
sensitive
to
this
demonization
after
what
went
on

texas
