CHURCH
THE
CHURCH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST

IT
IS
TRULY
INFORMATIVE
TO
STOP

AND
SEE
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL
PEOPLE
IN
THE
WORLD
LIKE
THOSE
THAT

US
IM
WILLING
TO
ADMIT
THAT
MEMBERS
OF
OTHER
CHURCHES
ARE
CHRISTIANS
IF
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
CHRIST
AND
TRY
TO
FOLLOW
HIS
TEACHINGS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
HAVE
DIFFERENT
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
AND
YET
THESE
OTHER
CHURCHES
OFTEN
GO
OUT
OF
THEIR
WAY
TO
DEFINE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
I
AM
CONSIDERED
