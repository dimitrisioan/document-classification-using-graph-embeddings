re
davidians
and
compassion
surely
you
are
not
equating
david
koresh
with
christianity
the
two
are
not
comparable
this
is
always
an
option
when
the
sect
is
causing
harm
relabel
the
cult
to
something
else
cheers
kent
good
point
i
would
not
doubt
that

could

extensive
bible
knowledge
was
one
way
he
sucked
in
the
fools
followers
quote
bible
all
you
want
i
too
judge
what
you
say
be
what
you
do
and
even
more
by
if
it
makes
sense
sense
common
that
is
doesnt
seem
so
common
after
all
