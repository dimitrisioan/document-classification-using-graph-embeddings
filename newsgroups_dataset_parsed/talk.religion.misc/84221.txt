neither
i
nor

has
ever
heard
of
francis
hitchings
who
is
he
please
do
not
answer
with
a
well
known
evolutionist
or
some
other
such
informationless
phrase
he
is
a
paleontologist
and
author
of
the
neck
of
the
giraffe
the
quote
was
taken
from
pg
jack
for
your
information
i
checked
the
library
of
congress
catalog
and
they
list
the
following
books
by
francis
hitching
earth
magic
the
neck
of
the
giraffe
or
where
darwin
went
wrong
pendulum
the
psi
connection
the
world
atlas
of
mysteries
followed
by
my
signature
i
was
extremely
careful
in
this
posting
not
to
say
anything
which
was
not
factual
i
made
no
judgement
about
hitching
or
the
quality
of
the
quotation
attributed
to
him
i
have
not
read
any
of
the
books
listed
although
i
did
glimpse
briefly
at
earth
magic
i
saw
nothing
that
i
would
care
to
comment
on
it
was
solely
in
response
to
an
inquiry
by
warren
about
hitching
and
your
assertion
that
he
is
a
paleontologist
i
do
not
know
whether
he
is
or
is
not
a
paleontologist
i
do
not
claim
to
know
anything
about
him
except
this
listing
of
his
publications
however
i
get
the
decided
impression
that
i
am
being
included
among
the
branch
atheists
on
the
basis
of
this
post
if
that
impression
is
mistaken
please
let
me
know
otherwise
i
should
let
you
know
that
the
implications
are
very
offensive
to
me
and
i
would
certainly
appreciate
a
clarification
of
your
posting
