re
whos
next
mormons
and
jews
would
someone
be
kind
enought
to
document
the
exact
nature
of
the
evidence
against
the
bds
without
reference
to
hearsay
or
newsreports
i
would
also
like
to
know
more
about
their
past
record
etc
but
again
based
on
solid
not
media
reports
my
reason
for
asking
for
such
evidence
is
that
last
night
on
larry
king
live
a
socalled
cultexpert
was
interviewed
from
australia
who
claimed
that
it
was
his
evidence
which
led
to
the
original
raid
this
admission
if
true
raises
the
nasty
possibility
that
the
government
acted
in
good
faith
which
i
believe
they
did
on
faulty
evidence
it
also
raises
the
possibility
that
other
self
proclaimed
cult
experts
were
advising
them
and
giving
ver
poor
advice
a
few
years
ago
anson
shupe
and
david
bromley
published
strange
gods
the
great
american
cult
scare
beacon
boston
and
the
new
vigilantes
anticultists
and
new
religions
sage
beverly
hills
both
books
suggested
the
possibility
of
tragic
results
if
selfproclaimed
cult
experts
were
ever
taken
seriously
perhaps
their
diagnosis
of
the
anitcult
movement
needs
investigating
in
light
of
the
waco
tragedy
