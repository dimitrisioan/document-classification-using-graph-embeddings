re
a
message
for
you
mr
president
how
do
you
know
what
happened
i
told
some
friends
of
mine
two
weeks
ago
that
koresh
was
dead
the
fbi
and
the
batf
could
not
let
a
man
like
that
live
he
was
a
testimonial
to
their
stupidity
and
lies
now
before
everyone
gets
crazy
with
me
let
me
say
that
koresh
was
crazy
as
a
bed
bug
but
out
government
was
crazierand
they
lied
to
us
they
told
us
compound
had
been
under
survaillance
for
quite
some
time
yet
whoever
was
watching
the
place
failed
to
see
that
koresh
went
jogging
and
into
town
on
a
regular
basis
everyone
in
the
area
claimed
to
have
seen
him
and
wondered
why
they
didnt
pick
him
up
then
there
are
two
possible
answers
first
they
didnt
see
him
what
kind
of
survaillance
is
that
second
they
didnt
care
they
wanted
a
confrontation
they
wanted
publicity
and
they
got
it
after
the
first
battle
they
told
us
that
they
did
not
know
he
knew
they
were
coming
they
also
said
it
would
have
been
foolish
to
go
in
knowing
that
well
we
know
now
that
they
intercepted
the
informants
call
and
went
in
anyway
did
they
explore
all
of
the
possibilities
for
ending
the
seige
according
to
them
they
did
but
according
to
the
hartford
courant
the
woman
that
raised
koresh
his
grandmother
was
not
allowed
to
go
in
and
see
him
the
fbi
agent
who
she
spoke
with
was
bob
ricks
and
according
to
the
paper
he
said
a
lot
of
people
think
if
you
just
talk
to
them
logically
they
will
come
out
his
grandmother
raised
vernon
howell
koreshs
real
name
she
didnt
raise
david
koresh
someone
who
raises
you
and
loves
you
does
not
speak
to
you
strickly
on
a
logical
level
there
is
also
an
emotional
level
on
which
they
can
reach
you
heres
another
one
all
during
this
operation
the
fbi
has
been
claiming
that
they
feared
a
mass
suicide
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
something
must
be
done
now
they
claim
they
never
thought
he
would
do
it
i
knew
they
were
going
to
do
something
when
they
started
talking
about
how
much
money
this
was
costing
that
was
the
start
of
the
justification
part
part
of
the
plan
thats
when
i
knew
it
would
come
soon
but
back
to
the
plan
it
is
considered
cruel
and
unusal
punishment
to
execute
criminals
in
the
minds
of
many
people
but
look
at
whats
acceptable
they
knew
the
parents
adults
had
gas
masks
they
did
not
know
or
were
not
sure
if
the
children
had
them
so
the
plan
was
to
pour
the
gas
into
the
compound
the
mothers
seeing
what
the
gas
was
doing
to
their
children
were
supposed
to
run
out
and
that
would
only
leave
the
men
to
deal
with
i
spent
two
years
in
the
army
and
like
everyother
veteran
i
went
through
cbr
chemical
biological
radiological
warfare
training
part
of
that
training
is
going
into
a
room
filled
with
the
same
stuff
that
the
children
were
subjected
to
to
make
the
stuff
really
interesting
the
gas
also
has
a
chemical
agent
that
irritates
the
skin
you
think
its
on
fire
i
have
no
doubts
the
children
would
become
hysterical
its
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
never
want
to
do
again
this
was
the
plan
the
final
solution
we
waited
days
for
our
hostages
to
come
home
from
iran
we
gave
these
people
days
i
stated
on
several
occasions
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
this
whole
thing
that
the
government
could
point
to
as
a
success
well
fbi
agent
ricks
changed
my
mind
again
a
newclip
from
the
hartford
courant
and
while
expressing
regret
at
the
loss
of
life
he
suggested
that
the
operation
had
been
at
least
a
modified
success
because
not
a
single
federal
shot
had
been
fired
and
not
a
single
federal
agent
had
been
hurt
it
took
dead
children
to
get
us
that
new
definition
of
success
one
more
thought
the
government
claimed
that
they
believed
he
had
automatic
weapons
on
the
premises
he
had
a
license
for
the
caliber
machine
gun
they
knew
damn
well
he
had
one
they
also
knew
he
had
it
legally
still
without
the
element
of
surprise
they
sent
in
agents
to
get
him
for
all
of
this
my
president
takes
full
responsibility
what
a
guy
i
hope
he
gets

before
you
go
absolving
the
batf
fbi
of
all
blame
in
this
incident
you
should
probably
be
aware
of
two
important
facts
there
is
no
such
thing
as
nontoxic
tear
gas
tear
gas
is
nonbreathable
remaining
in
its
presence
will
cause
nausea
and
vomiting
followed
eventually
by
siezures
and
death
did
the
fbi
know
the
physical
health
of
all
the
people
they
exposed
any
potential
heart
problems
among
the
bds
no
doubt
it
is
dangerous
stuff
when
concentrated
have
you
ever
seen
a
tear
gas
canister
tear
gas
is
produced
by
burning
a
chemical
in
the
can
the
fumes
produced
are
tear
gas
the
canister
has
a
warning
printed
on
the
side
of
it
contact
with
flamable
material
can
result
in
fire
now
how
many
of
these
canisters
did
they
throw
inside
a
building
they
admited
was
a
firetrap
none
they
used
nonincindiary
methods
which
means
they
produced
the
gas
outside
the
building
and
pumped
it
in
via
the
tanks
