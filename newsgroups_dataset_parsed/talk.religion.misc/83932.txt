RE
THE
LIST
OF
BIBLICAL
CONTRADICTIONS
JIM

I
FEEL
THAT
THOSE
WHO
USE
THE
KJV
AS
A
BASIS
FOR
ARGUING
BIBLICAL
CONTRADICTIONS
ARE
EITHER
BEING
INTELLECTUALLY
DISHONEST
PURPOSEFULLY
WANTING
TO
SHOW
THE
BIBLE
IN
THE
WORST
LIGHT
POSSIBLE
OR
THEY
ARE
BEING
MENTALLY
LAZY
AND
ARE
TAKING
THE
EASY
WAY
OUT
EITHER
WAY
THEY
LEAVE
THE
THEIST
THE
OPTION
OF
COUNTERING
WITH
WELL
THATS
JUST
THE
KJV
THATS
NOT
WHAT
MY
XXX
VERSION
SAYS
DELETED
UNFORTUNATELY
ITS
NOT
THAT
SIMPLE
THE
KJV
IS
PREFERRED
BY
THE
MAJORITY
OF
FUNDAMENTALISTS
AT
LEAST
HERE
THE
SECOND
PART
OF
YOUR
ARGUMENT
FAILS
AS
WELL
SINCE
THAT
STATEMENT
CAN
BE
USED
AGAINST
ANY
VERSION
NOT
JUST
THE
KJV
DELETED
IVE
BASED
MY
ARGUMENT
ON
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
MODERN
TRANSLATIONS
AVAILABLE
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
THE
WORK
OF
THE
LEADING
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
DELETED
I
WOULD
NOT
FIND
THIS
STATEMENT
TO
BE
VERY
USEFUL
SINCE
IT
IS
AN
APPEAL
TO
AUTHORITY
AND
THE
OPPOSITION
WILL
JUST
CLAIM
THAT
THEIR
AUTHORITIES
ARE
BETTER
A
SECOND
TACT
THAT
LOCAL
CREATIONISTS
HAVE
USED
IS
TO
REPLY
BUT
THOSE
SCHOLARS
ARE
ATHEISTS
AND
CANNOT
BE
BELIEVED
THEY
WILL
ALSO
USE
THIS
PHRASE
TO
DESCRIBE
ANY
THEOLOGIANS
THAT
THEY
DONT
AGREE
WITH
DELETED
GEN
AND
THE
FLOCKS
CONCEIVED
BEFORE
THE
RODS
AND
BROUGHT
FORTH
CATTLE
RINGSTRAKED
SPECKLED
AND
SPOTTED
DELETED
THE
VERSE
BEING
DISCUSSED
CLEARLY
CLAIMS
THAT
SYMPATHETIC
MAGIC
WORKS
IE
PLACING
STRIPPED
STICKS
IN
THE
CATTLE
BREEDING
GROUNDS
CAUSES
STRIPPED
AND
SPOTTED
CALVES
TO
BE
BORN
AND
SHOULD
BE
ATTACKED
ON
THAT
BASIS
NO
BIOLOGIST
HAS
EVER
OBSERVED
THIS
CLAIMED
CORRELATION
