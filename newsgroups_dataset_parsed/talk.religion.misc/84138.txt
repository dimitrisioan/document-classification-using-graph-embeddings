re
christians
above
the
law
was
clarification
of
pe
in
article
nunnallyacshardingedu
john
nunnally
writes
when
are
we
going
to
hear
a
christian
answer
to
this
question
in
paraphrase
on
what
or
whose
authority
do
christians
proclaim
that
they
are
above
the
law
and
above
the
prophets
major
and
minor
and
not
accountable
to
the
ten
commandments
of
which
jesus
clearly
spoke
his
opinion
in
matthew
what
is
the
source
of
this
pseudodoctrine
who
is
the
pseudoteacher
who
is
the
great
deceiver
ok
heres
at
least
one
christians
answer
jesus
was
a
jew
not
a
christian
in
this
context
matthew
makes
sense
matt
do
not
think
that
i
jesus
came
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
did
not
come
to
abolish
but
to
fulfill
jesus
lived
under
the
jewish
law
however
he
was
the
culmination
of
the
promises
of
the
prophets
he
came
to
fulfill
the
prophecies
and
fully
obey
gods
purposes
verse
says
for
truly
i
say
to
you
until
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
not
the
smallest
letter
or
stroke
shall
pass
away
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplished
the
key
to
this
verse
imho
is
the
last
phrase
jesus
as
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
accomplished
what
the
law
was
supposed
to
accomplish
jesus
did
not
say
that
he
was
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
and
unless
im
mistaken
heaven
and
earth
have
not
yet
passed
away
am
i
mistaken
and
even
assuming
that
one
can
just
gloss
over
that
portion
of
the
word
of
jesus
do
you
really
think
that
all
is
accomplished
verse
whoever
then
annuls
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
so
teaches
others
shall
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
keeps
and
teaches
them
he
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
taken
in
the
context
of
jesus
teaching
jewish
people
about
living
lives
under
the
law
this
makes
sense
then
why
didnt
jesus
say
any
jew
who
annuls
in
v
are
you
saying
that
all
of
jesus
recorded
words
mean
nothing
to
gentiles
are
you
really
saying
that
jesus
only
spoke
for
and
to
the
jews
jesus
didnt
mention
your
name
does
that
mean
he
wasnt
speaking
to
you
when
you
read
the
words
of
jesus
do
you
think
he
is
speaking
to
someone
other
than
you
in
general
it
appears
that
jesus
is
responding
to
some
criticism
he
must
have
received
about
doing
away
with
the
law
that
was
not
jesus
intent
at
all
you
said
above
that
jesus
was
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
are
you
saying
that
does
not
mean
doing
away
with
the
law
he
had
come
to
earth
to
live
the
law
as
it
should
be
lived
and
fulfill
the
promises
made
by
god
to
his
people
all
the
way
back
to
eve
gen
serpent
will
bruise
your
heel
but
he
will
bruise
his
head
i
will
put
enmity
between
you
and
the
woman
and
between
your
offspring
and
hers
they
shall
strike
at
your
head
and
you
shall
strike
at
their
heel
i
will
put
enmity
between
you
and
the
woman
and
between
your
offspring
and
hers
he
will
strike
your
head
and
you
will
strike
his
heel
and
i
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed
it
shall
bruise
thy
head
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel
looks
like
your
translation
has
taken
a
few
liberties
with
the
word
jesus
appeared
to
be
doing
away
with
the
law
because
he
did
not
honor
the
traditions
of
men
as
equal
to
the
law
of
god
he
regularly
locked
horns
with
the
religious
leaders
of
the
day
because
he
would
not
conform
to
their
rules
only
gods
law
in
the
matthew
passage
jesus
is
defending
his
dedication
to
the
law
and
defending
himself
against
his
accusors
almost
the
entire
sermon
on
the
mount
matt
is
dedicated
to
helping
the
jewish
people
understand
the
true
intent
of
the
law
sweeping
away
the
clutter
which
had
been
introduced
by
the
pharasees
and
their
traditions
only
helping
the
jewish
people
in
galatians
paul
describes
the
relationship
of
jesus
to
the
law
in
this
way
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
in
custody
under
the
law
being
shut
up
to
the
faith
which
was
later
to
be
revealed
therefore
the
law
has
become
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
that
we
may
be
justified
by
faith
but
now
that
faith
has
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
for
you
are
all
sons
of
god
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
i
believe
this
says
that
after
christ
was
revealed
the
law
had
served
its
purpose
ie
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
and
now
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
the
law
has
been
fulfilled
as
christ
said
he
would
do
you
are
using
your
interpretation
of
paul
as
an
argument
against
the
clear
words
of
jesus
god
the
author
of
the
old
law
and
the
christman
jesus
are
the
same
personality
therefore
the
old
law
and
the
new
testament
the
last
will
and
testament
of
jesus
are
based
on
the
same
moral
principles
it
makes
sense
that
many
of
the
principles
in
the
old
law
are
reexpressed
in
christianity
reexpressed
care
to
define
that
a
bit
better
on
the
other
hand
now
that
the
law
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
what
are
heaven
and
earth
gone
away
where
did
they
go
is
all
accomplished
for
example
revelations
explain
please
christians
relate
to
god
through
christ
not
the
law
it
also
makes
sense
that
new
practices
and
new
symbolisms
were
established
to
represent
the
mysteries
of
this
new
relationship
ie
baptism
representing
christs
death
burial
and
resurrection
rom
the
lords
supper
as
a
memorial
to
his
sacrifice
i
cor
and
sunday
as
a
day
of
worship
commemorating
his
resurrection
matt
acts
again
your
interpretation
of
paul
versus
the
clear
word
of
jesus
do
you
see
any
problems
here
when
did
heaven
and
earth
go
away
when
was
all
accomplished
ok
thats
one
christians
explanation
i
dont
claim
to
have
all
these
issues
completely
settled
even
in
my
own
mind
and
i
welcome
other
christians
to
offer
other
alternatives
please
excuse
the
long
posting
thanks
for
your
interest
if
you
have
read
this
far
