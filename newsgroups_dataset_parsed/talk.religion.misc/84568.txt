if
you
would
like
to
understand
better
the
sort
of
behavior
that
we
saw
in
connection
with
the
waco
tragedy
id
strongly
recommend
reading
when
prophecy
fails
by
leon
festinger
henry
riecken
and
stanley
schachter
available
as
a
harper
torchbook
it
goes
a
long
way
towards
explaining
how
a
belief
system
can
be
so
strong
as
to
withstand
even
overwhelming
disconfirmatory
evidence
at
least
read
the
first
chapter
interestingly
just
as
the
branch
davidians
had
roots
in
the
seventhday
adventist
movement
the
sdas
themselves
had
their
roots
in
the
millerite
movement
of
the
first
half
of
the
centurya
movement
that
expected
the
end
of
the
world
in
was
disappointed
when
it
did
not
take
place
and
wound
up
as
a
church
thats
also
how
christianity
came
to
be
the
immediate
return
of
jesus
was
expected
when
it
didnt
happen
they
formed
their
own
church
