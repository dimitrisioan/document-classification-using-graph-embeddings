MALCOLM
LEE
WRITES
THESE
LAWS
WRITTEN
FOR
THE
ISRAELITES
GODS
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
WHOM
GOD
HAD
EXPRESSLY
SET
APART
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
THE
ISRAELITES
WERE
A
DIRECT
WITNESS
TO
GODS
EXISTENCE
TO
DISOBEY
GOD
AFTER
KNOWING
THAT
GOD
IS
REAL
WOULD
BE
AN
OUTRIGHT
DENIAL
OF
GOD
AND
THEREFORE
IMMEDIATELY
PUNISHABLE
REMEMBER
THESE
LAWS
WERE
WRITTEN
FOR
A
DIFFERENT
TIME
AND
APPLIED
ONLY
TO
GODS
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
BUT
JESUS
HAS
CHANGED
ALL
OF
THAT
WE
ARE
LIVING
IN
THE
AGE
OF
GRACE
SIN
IS
NO
LONGER
IMMEDIATELY
PUNISHABLE
BY
DEATH
THERE
IS
REPENTANCE
AND
THERE
IS
SALVATION
THROUGH
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
NOT
JUST
FOR
A
FEW
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
SALVATION
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
EVERYONE
JEW
AND
GENTILE
ALIKE
SORRY
IF
THIS
IS
LATE
FOR
THE
THREAD
BUT
I
THOUGHT
GOD
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
CONSTANT
AND
NEVERCHANGING
HOW
DO
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
COMMON
CHRISTIAN
VIEW
WITH
THE
PARAGRAPH
ABOVE
GOD
NEVER
CHANGES
HE
STILL
LOVES
US
SENDING
JESUS
WAS
ONE
OF
HIS
ATTEMPTS
TO
RECONCILE
WITH
MANKIND
THE
NATURE
OF
GOD
HAS
NOT
CHANGED
ALSO
WHILE
WERE
AT
IT
HOW
DO
YOU
RECONCILE
A
KIND
AND
LOVING
GOD
WITH
THE
JUDEOCHRISTIAN
VIEW
THAT
SIN
WAS
AT
ONE
TIME
IMMEDIATELY
PUNISHABLE
BY
DEATH
WAS
KILLING
PEOPLE
FOR
SINNING
GODS
WAY
OF
SHOWING
KINDNESS
AND
LOVE
SINNING
IN
THE
FACE
OF
GOD
WAS
PUNISHABLE
BY
IMMEDIATE
DEATH
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
OT
PASSAGES
TO
BACK
THIS
UP
GOD
IS
GOD
HE
CANNOT
TOLERATE
THE
PRESCENCE
OF
SIN
IN
HIS
MIDST
AND
THE
ISRAELITES
KNEW
THIS
AND
STILL
SOME
OF
THEM
CHOSE
TO
DISOBEY
AND
WERE
DESTROYED
WERE
THESE
PEOPLE
KIND
AND
LOVING
THEMSELVES
GOD
GAVE
THEM
EVERY
BREAK
HE
COULD
BUT
IN
THE
END
HE
REALLY
HAD
NO
CHOICE
IN
THE
MATTER
SEEING
AS
HOW
WE
WERE
FAILING
TO
ACHIEVE
SALVATION
ON
OUR
OWN
HE
SENT
HIS
SON
TO
DIE
FOR
US
TO
BE
THE
ULTIMATE
SIN
OFFERING
NOW
WE
LIVE
IN
THE
AGE
OF
GRACE
IS
THE
FACT
THE
HE
NO
LONGER
DOES
THIS
AN
ADMISSION
ON
HIS
PART
OF
HAVING
MADE
A
MISTAKE
HE
SENT
HIS
SON
AS
A
CONSOLATION
TO
US
OUT
OF
LOVE
NOW
THAT
WE
ARE
LIVING
IN
THE
AGE
OF
GRACE
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
FOR
OUR
SINS
GOD
NOW
DAMNS
US
TO
ETERNAL
HELL
AFTER
WE
DIE
RATHER
THAN
KILLING
US
IMMEDIATELY
IF
SO
IS
THIS
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
KIND
AND
LOVING
GOD
HEY
LETS
BE
FAIR
FOR
A
MOMENT
HERE
KIND
AND
LOVING
DOES
NOT
MEAN
A
FREE
RIDE
THERE
IS
AN
AMOUNT
OF
GIVE
AND
TAKE
AS
IN
ANY
RELATIONSHIP
PARENTS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
KIND
AND
LOVING
BUT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
CHILDREN
CAN
DO
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
NOT
PART
OF
BEING
A
PARENT
MEANS
ADMINISTERING
PUNISHMENT
WHEN
THE
CHILD
IS
AT
FAULT
PART
OF
BEING
A
PARENT
MEANS
GIVING
INSTRUCTION
GOD
TESTS
US
THROUGH
THE
TRIAL
OF
LIFE
SUCH
THAT
WE
MAY
GROW
STRONGER
HE
TEACHES
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
AND
WHAT
IS
WRONG
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
OUR
ACTIONS
ARE
MADE
CLEAR
TO
US
BE
IT
HEAVEN
OR
BE
IT
HELL
IF
GOD
DID
NOT
FOLLOW
THROUGH
WITH
WHAT
HE
HAS
WARNED
US
ABOUT
HE
WOULD
NOT
BE
A
VERY
GOOD
PARENT
IN
PARENTING
IF
A
PARENT
ISSUES
A
WARNING
BUT
DOES
NOT
FOLLOW
THROUGH
WITH
IT
THE
CHILDREN
WILL
NOT
TAKE
THAT
PARENTS
WORDS
VERY
SERIOUSLY
GOD
DOES
THE
SAME
BY
TELLING
US
WHO
HAVE
EARS
TO
HEAR
WHAT
TO
DO
AND
WHAT
NOT
TO
DO
BY
LIFES
TRIALS
WE
SEE
THE
FOLLY
OF
DOING
OUR
OWN
WILL
RATHER
THAN
HIS
HE
WARNS
US
ABOUT
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
REJECTING
HIM
WHEN
IT
COMES
TIME
FOR
JUDGEMENT
DO
WE
FOLLOW
HIM
I
WILL
PEACE
BE
WITH
YOU
