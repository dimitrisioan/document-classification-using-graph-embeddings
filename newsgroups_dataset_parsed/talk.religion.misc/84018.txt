WRITES
FOR
THOSE
WHO
THINK
DAVID
KORESH
DIDNT
HAVE
A
SOLID
STRUCTURE
OR
SOUND
BIBLICAL
BACKING
FOR
HIS
HOUR
LONG
TAPE
BROADCAST
I
DONT
THINK
ANYONE
REALLY
CARES
ABOUT
THE
SOLID
STRUCTURE
OF
HIS
SERMON
OTHER
THAN
IT
TELLS
QUITE
A
LOT
ABOUT
THE
MAN
HIMSELF
ITS
THE
DEATHS
HES
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THAT
CONCERN
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
YOU
THE
SPOKESMAN
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
IVE
ENCLOSED
A
PARTIAL
LIST
OF
THE
SOURCES
HE
CITES
OR
QUOTES
HE
EXACTLY
USED
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
SERMON
ITS
PRETTY
GOOD
IF
NOT
INSPIRED
THOUGH
I
DIFFER
IN
PART
ON
SOME
OF
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
THE
ARGUMENT
HE
PRESENTS
IS
WELL
BACKED
WHICH
IS
WHY
ITS
TAKEN
ME
THIS
LONG
TO
WORK
THROUGH
STILL
ONGOING
IF
YOU
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
RAMBLING
THAT
SAYS
FAR
MORE
ABOUT
YOU
THAN
IT
DOES
KORESH
YOUVE
MADE
ME
CURIOUS
WHAT
DOES
THIS
SAY
ABOUT
ME
THAT
YOU
DONT
RECOGNIZE
THE
BIBLICAL
COMMENTARY
USED
THOSE
IN
THE
CHURCH
KNOW
THE
LANGUAGE
THOUGH
AND
HAVE
NO
SUCH
EXCUSE
FIRST
SEAL
IN
REVELATION
THE
ENTIRETY
OF
PSALMS
AND
THE
MOST
OF
REVELATION
WHICH
DEMONSTRATED
ONE
OF
HIS
MAJOR
POINTS
ABOUT
HOW
THE
WRITINGS
IN
THE
PROPHETS
INCLUDING
DAVID
AND
IN
THE
PSALMS
AND
IN
REVELATION
ARE
ALL
TELLING
THE
SAME
STORY
WHEN
YOU
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THEYRE
RELATED
IE
HAVE
THE
KEY
THEY
LARGELY
EXPLAIN
EACH
OTHER
CHARLES
MANSON
USED
REVELATION
AS
WELL
DO
WE
SEE
A
PATTERN
HERE
I
WONDER
IF
KORESH
LIKED
THE
BEATLES
YOU
MISSED
THE
POINT
WHICH
IS
THAT
THE
PROPHETS
THE
PSALMS
AND
REVELATION
ALL
TOGETHER
PROVIDE
A
VERY
RICH
VIEW
OF
A
VERY
SPECIAL
EVENT
A
WEDDING
KORESH
WAS
A
NUT
OKAY
JUST
BECAUSE
HE
FOUND
WAYS
FOR
THE
BIBLE
TO
BACKUP
HIS
RANTINGS
DOES
NOT
MAKE
HIM
ANY
LESS
OF
A
KOOK
HOW
ARE
YOU
ABLE
TO
MAKE
SUCH
A
CONCLUSION
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
REVELATION
MAKES
IT
CLEAR
THAT
THE
ADDRESS
IS
TO
THOSE
IN
THE
CHURCH
THAT
SAID
IT
DOESNT
HURT
TO
TRY
TO
SEE
WHAT
THE
PROPHECIES
ARE
AHEAD
OF
TIME
FOR
THOSE
OUTSIDE
THE
CHURCH
SEEMS
TO
ME
KORESH
IS
YET
ANOTHER
MESSENGER
THAT
GOT
KILLED
FOR
THE
MESSAGE
HE
CARRIED
ILL
TYPE
THIS
VERY
SLOWLY
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
UNDERSTAND
HE
EITHER
SET
THE
FIRE
HIMSELF
OR
TOLD
HIS
FOLLOWERS
TO
DO
SO
DONT
MAKE
HIM
OUT
TO
BE
A
MARTYR
HE
DID
NOT
GET
KILLED
HE
KILLED
HIMSELF
SO
YOU
SAY
IT
SHOULD
BE
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
WHAT
THE
INVESTIGATORS
CONCLUDE
AND
WHAT
THE
FINAL
JUDGMENTS
ARE
IN
THE
MEAN
TIME
WE
SURE
LEARNED
A
LOT
ABOUT
EVIL
AND
CORRUPTION
ARE
YOU
SURPRISED
THINGS
HAVE
GOTTEN
THAT
ROTTEN
THE
EVIL
WAS
INSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
ALL
THAT
THOU
SHALT
NOT
KILL
STUFF
SO
MUCH
FOR
WAR
AND
GOVERNMENT
EH
OH
YEAH
ONE
LAST
POINT
FOR
THE
BELIEVERS
PHILIPPIAN
FOR
THE
REST
OF
US
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
POST
THE
TEXT
VERY
GLAD
YOU
ASKED
SINCE
I
GOOFED
IT
SHOULD
BE
PHILIPPIAN
HERE
FROM
NIV
BECAUSE
OF
MY
CHAINS
MOST
OF
THE
BROTHERS
IN
THE
LORD
HAVE
BEEN
ENCOURAGED
TO
SPEAK
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
MORE
COURAGEOUSLY
AND
FEARLESSLY
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
SOME
PREACH
CHRIST
OUT
OF
ENVY
AND
RIVALRY
BUT
OTHERS
OUT
OF
GOOD
WILL
THE
LATTER
DO
SO
IN
LOVE
KNOWING
THAT
I
AM
PUT
HERE
FOR
THE
GOSPEL
THE
FORMER
PREACH
CHRIST
OUT
OF
SELFISH
AMBITION
NOT
SINCERELY
SUPPOSING
THAT
THEY
CAN
STIR
UP
TROUBLE
FOR
ME
WHILE
I
AM
CHAINS
BUT
WHAT
DOES
IT
MATTER
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
IS
THAT
IN
EVERY
WAY
WHETHER
FROM
FALSE
MOTIVES
OR
TRUE
CHRIST
IS
PREACHED
AND
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
I
REJOICE
MY
COMMENT
STEMS
FROM
THE
REALIZATION
THAT
WE
WHO
LOVE
THE
LORD
ARE
HUMAN
AND
IMPERFECT
WHATEVER
WE
PREACH
NO
MATTER
HOW
ELOQUENT
OR
HOW
CORRUPTED
IS
OF
LITTLE
DIFFERENCE
THOSE
WHO
KNOW
THE
MASTERS
VOICE
WILL
RECOGNIZE
HIM
A
GEMSTONE
AMIDST
ROCK
SUCH
IS
ALSO
THE
LESSON
OF
THE
STUMBLINGBLOCK
FOR
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
AN
EAR
TO
HEAR
