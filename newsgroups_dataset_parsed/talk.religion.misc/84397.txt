i
am
surprised
and
saddened
i
would
expect
this
kind
of
behavior
from
the
evangelical
bornagain
gospelthumping
inyourface
were
theonlytruechristian
protestants
but
i
have
always
thought
that
catholics
behaved
better
than
this
please
do
not
stoop
to
the
level
of
the
e
ba
gt
iyf
wtotc
protestants
who
think
that
the
best
way
to
witness
is
to
be
strident
intrusive
loud
insulting
and
overbearingly
selfrighteous
pleading
mode
on
please
im
begging
you
quit
confusing
religious
groups
and
stop
making
generalizations
im
a
protestant
im
an
evangelical
i
dont
believe
that
my
way
is
the
only
way
im
not
a
creation
scientist
i
dont
think
that
homosexuals
should
be
hung
by
their
toenails
if
you
want
to
discuss
bible
thumpers
you
would
be
better
off
singling
out
and
making
obtuse
generalizations
about
fundamentalists
if
you
compared
the
actions
of
presbyterians
or
methodists
with
those
of
southern
baptists
you
would
think
that
they
were
different
religions
sarcasm
on
be
sure
we
pick
on
the
correct
groups
here
bible
thumpers
fundamentalists
and
southern
baptists
deserve
our
hasty
generalizations
and
prejudicial
statements
just
dont
pick
on
the
presbyterians
and
the
methodists
sarcasm
off
please
prejudice
is
about
thinking
that
all
people
of
a
group
are
the
same
so
please
dont
write
off
all
protestants
or
all
evangelicals
pleading
mode
off
godi
wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
all
the
