can
you
please
point
to
something
anything
that
proves
to
me
that
the
universe
cannot
possibly
be
explained
without
accepting
as
a
fact
the
existence
of
a
god
in
precisely
the
way
your
holy
book
describes
can
you
please
convince
me
that
your
religion
is
more
than
a
very
cleverlyconstructed
fable
and
that
it
does
indeed
have
some
bearing
on
my
own
personal
daytoday
life
would
you
consider
the
word
of
an
eyewitness
peter
to
testify
to
the
events
surrounding
jesus
life
no
there
are
two
problems
here
peter
died
two
millenia
ago
the
original
letters
he
wrote
have
long
since
decayed
into
dust
if
he
were
alive
today
and
i
could
question
him
then
this
might
lend
credibility
to
your
claims
but
probably
not
much
because
after
all
ive
heard
people
claim
with
all
sincerity
that
theyve
spoken
with
elvis
recently
but
after
his
death
peters
writings
were
transcribed
by
monks
for
centuries
and
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
one
of
them
somewhere
didnt
decide
to
change
the
wording
of
something
to
make
it
in
his
opinion
a
little
easier
to
understand
even
if
peter
did
witness
the
miracles
of
jesus
two
millenia
ago
that
doesnt
mean
that
your
deity
is
what
the
bible
says
it
is
god
might
just
be
satan
trying
to
convince
everyone
that
hes
a
nice
guy
or
even
that
your
deity
is
still
alive
and
active
in
the
world
today
nice
try
but
it
just
isnt
enough
to
convince
me
especially
since
your
wild
claims
about
your
deity
seem
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
way
ive
observed
the
world
to
work
please
find
something
more
compelling
