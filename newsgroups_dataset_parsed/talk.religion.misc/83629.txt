ROBERT
WEISS
SAYS
RA
RA
WELL
JASON
ITS
HERETICAL
IN
A
FEW
WAYS
THE
FIRST
POINT
IS
THAT
RA
THIS
EQUATES
LUCIFER
AND
JESUS
AS
BEING
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
BEING
RA
HOWEVER
LUCIFER
IS
A
CREATED
BEING
THOU
WAST
PERFECT
IN
THY
RA
WAYS
FROM
THE
DAY
THAT
THOU
WAST
CREATED
TILL
INIQUITY
WAS
FOUND
IN
RA
THEE
EZEKIEL
WHILE
JESUS
IS
UNCREATED
AND
THE
CREATOR
OF
RA
ALL
THINGS
IN
THE
BEGINNING
WAS
THE
WORD
AND
THE
WORD
WAS
WITH
RA
GOD
AND
THE
WORD
WAS
GOD
THE
SAME
WAS
IN
THE
BEGINNING
WITH
GOD
RA
ALL
THINGS
WERE
MADE
BY
HIM
AND
WITHOUT
HIM
WAS
NOT
ANY
THING
MADE
RA
THAT
WAS
MADE
JOHN
AND
HE
IS
BEFORE
ALL
THINGS
AND
BY
RA
HIM
ALL
THINGS
CONSIST
COLOSSIANS
RA
RA
YOUR
INFERENCE
FROM
THE
EZEKIEL
AND
JOHN
PASSAGES
THAT
LUCIFER
WAS
RA
CREATED
AND
THAT
JESUS
WAS
NOT
DEPENDS
ON
A
PARTICULAR
INTERPETATION
OF
RA
THE
WORD
CREATE
ONE
WITH
WHICH
MANY
CHRISTIANS
MAY
NOT
AGREE
RA
GRANTED
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
THAT
ALL
OF
GODS
CHILDREN
INCLUDING
CHRIST
RA
AND
LUCIFER
ARE
ETERNALLY
EXISTENT
INTELLIGENCES
WHICH
WERE
ORGANIZED
RA
INTO
SPIRIT
CHILDREN
BY
GOD
THE
TERM
CREATION
CAN
APPLY
EQUALLY
WELL
RA
TO
BOTH
OF
THOSE
PASSAGES
JUST
BRIEFLY
ON
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
IN
PASSING
YOU
REFER
TO
DIFFERING
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
CREATE
AND
SAY
THAT
MANY
CHRISTIANS
MAY
NOT
AGREE
SO
WHAT
THAT
IS
REALLY
IRRELEVANT
WE
DO
NOT
BASE
OUR
FAITH
ON
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
THINK
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
DO
WE
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
TRUTH
REGARDLESS
OF
POPULARITY
OF
OPINIONS
ALSO
I
FIND
IT
RATHER
STRANGE
THAT
IN
TRYING
TO
PERSUADE
THAT
CREATED
AND
ETERNALLY
EXISTENT
ARE
EQUIVALENT
YOU
SAY
GRANTED
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
YOU
CANT
GRANT
YOUR
CONCLUSION
AND
THEN
EXPECT
THE
POINT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
ADDRESSED
IN
ORDER
TO
REPLY
TO
THE
ISSUE
YOU
HAVE
TO
ADDRESS
AND
ANSWER
THE
POINT
THAT
WAS
RAISED
AND
NOT
JUST
JUMP
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
YOU
GRANT
THE
BIBLE
STATES
THAT
LUCIFER
WAS
CREATED
THE
BIBLE
STATES
THAT
JESUS
IS
THE
CREATOR
OF
ALL
THE
CONTRADICTION
THAT
WE
HAVE
IS
THAT
THE
LDS
BELIEF
IS
THAT
JESUS
AND
LUCIFER
WERE
THE
SAME
RA
YOUR
POINT
THAT
WE
ALL
ARE
BROTHERS
OF
JESUS
AND
LUCIFER
IS
ALSO
RA
HERETICAL
SINCE
WE
ARE
NOT
INNATELY
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
OF
CHRIST
RA
WE
ARE
ADOPTED
FOR
YE
HAVE
NOT
RECEIVED
THE
SPIRIT
OF
BONDAGE
RA
AGAIN
TO
FEAR
BUT
YE
HAVE
RECEIVED
THE
SPIRIT
OF
ADOPTION
WHEREBY
RA
WE
CRY
ABBA
FATHER
ROMANS
AND
NOT
THE
NATURAL
CHILDREN
RA
OF
GOD
IT
IS
ONLY
THROUGH
FAITH
THAT
WE
EVEN
ENTER
THE
FAMILY
OF
RA
GOD
FOR
YE
ARE
ALL
THE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
BY
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
RA
GALATIANS
AND
IT
IS
ONLY
THROUGH
THE
MANIFESTATION
OF
THIS
RA
FAITH
IN
RECEIVING
JESUS
THAT
WE
ARE
BECOME
THE
SONS
OF
GOD
BUT
RA
AS
MANY
AS
RECEIVED
HIM
TO
THEM
GAVE
HE
POWER
TO
BECOME
THE
SONS
OF
RA
GOD
EVEN
TO
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
ON
HIS
NAME
WHICH
WERE
BORN
NOT
RA
OF
BLOOD
NOR
OF
THE
WILL
OF
THE
FLESH
NOR
OF
THE
WILL
OF
MAN
BUT
RA
OF
GOD
JOHN
RA
RA
HAS
IT
OCCURED
TO
YOU
ROBERT
THAT
BEING
BORN
OF
SOMEONE
OR
BEING
RA
OF
THAT
PERSON
OR
PERSONS
FAMILY
MAY
BE
A
SYMBOLIC
TERM
IN
THE
NEW
RA
TESTAMENT
MORMONS
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
ARE
ADOPTED
INTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
RA
ISRAEL
THROUGH
BAPTISM
AND
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
ALTHOUGH
SOME
HAVE
EXPRESSED
RA
BELIEF
THAT
THIS
DOES
EVINCE
A
PHYSICAL
CHANGE
IN
OUR
BODIES
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
IS
THAT
ALL
ARE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
LITERALLY
THERE
IS
NOTHING
SYMBOLIC
ABOUT
IT
THIS
HOWEVER
CONTRADICTS
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THAT
NOT
EVERYONE
IS
A
CHILD
OF
GOD
THE
FIELD
IS
THE
WORLD
THE
GOOD
SEED
ARE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
KINGDOM
BUT
THE
TARES
ARE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
WICKED
ONE
MATTHEW
I
SPEAK
THAT
WHICH
I
HAVE
SEEN
WITH
MY
FATHER
AND
YE
DO
THAT
WHICH
YE
HAVE
SEEN
WITH
YOUR
FATHER
JOHN
YE
DO
THE
DEEDS
OF
YOUR
FATHER
THEN
SAID
THEY
TO
HIM
WE
BE
NOT
BORN
OF
FORNICATION
WE
HAVE
ONE
FATHER
EVEN
GOD
JESUS
SAID
UNTO
THEM
IF
GOD
WERE
YOUR
FATHER
YE
WOULD
LOVE
ME
FOR
I
PROCEEDED
FORTH
AND
CAME
FROM
GOD
NEITHER
CAME
I
OF
MYSELF
BUT
HE
SENT
ME
WHY
DO
YE
NOT
UNDERSTAND
MY
SPEECH
EVEN
BECAUSE
YE
CANNOT
HEAR
MY
WORD
YE
ARE
OF
YOUR
FATHER
THE
DEVIL
AND
THE
LUSTS
OF
YOUR
FATHER
YE
WILL
DO
HE
WAS
A
MURDERER
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
AND
ABODE
NOT
IN
THE
TRUTH
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
TRUTH
IN
HIM
WHEN
HE
SPEAKETH
A
LIE
HE
SPEAKETH
OF
HIS
OWN
FOR
HE
IS
A
LIAR
AND
THE
FATHER
OF
IT
JOHN
AND
SAID
O
FULL
OF
ALL
SUBTILTY
AND
ALL
MISCHIEF
THOU
CHILD
OF
THE
DEVIL
THOU
ENEMY
OF
ALL
RIGHTEOUSNESS

THOU
NOT
CEASE
TO
PERVERT
THE
RIGHT

THIS
THE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
ARE
MANIFEST
AND
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
DEVIL
WHOSOEVER
DOETH
NOT
RIGHTEOUSNESS
IS
NOT
OF
GOD
NEITHER
HE
THAT
LOVETH
NOT
HIS
BROTHER
JOHN
ONE
BECOMES
A
CHILD
OF

BUT
AS
MANY
AS
RECEIVED
HIM
TO
THEM
GAVE
HE
POWER
TO

THE
SONS
OF

TO
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
ON

WHAT
MANNER
OF
LOVE
THE
FATHER
HATH
BESTOWED
UPON
US
THAT
WE
SHOULD
BE
CALLED

THEREFORE
THE

NOW
ARE
WE
THE
SONS

THAT
WHEN

APPEAR
WE
SHALL
BE
LIKE
HIM
FOR
WE
SHALL
SEE
HIM
AS
HE
IS

WHICH
WERE
BORN
NOT
OF

NOR
OF
THE

THE
RA
DOCTRINES
OF
THE
LDS
THAT
I
HAVE
MENTIONED
PORTRAY
A
VASTLY
RA
DIFFERENT
JESUS
A
JESUS
THAT
CANNOT
BE
RECONCILED
WITH
THE
JESUS
OF
RA
THE
BIBLE
THEY
ARE
SO
FAR
REMOVED
FROM
EACH
OTHER
THAT
TO
PROCLAIM
RA
ONE
AS
BEING
TRUE
DENIES
THE
OTHER
FROM
BEING
TRUE
ACCORDING
TO
THE

ETERNAL
LIFE
IS
DEPENDENT
ON
KNOWING
THE
ONLY
TRUE

RA
RA
ROBERT
WITH
ALL
DUE

DIED

LEFT
YOU
CHIEF
ARBITER
OF
RA
CORRECT
BIBLICAL
INTERPRETATION
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
BE
SNOTTY
ABOUT
THIS
RA
BUT
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
SO
DIFFERENTLY
INTERPRETED
BY
DIFFERENT
RA
GROUPS
OF
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
OF
THE
JEHOVAHS
RA
WITNESSES
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
TO
MAKE
REFERENCE
TO
THE
JESUS
OF
THE
RA
BIBLE
IS
SIMPLY
RIDICULOUS
WHOSE
JESUS
OF
THE
BIBLE
DO
YOU
MEAN
THIS
IS
REALLY
A
RED
HERRING
IT
DOESNT
ADDRESS
ANY
ISSUE
RAISED
BUT
RATHER
IT
SEEKS
TO
OBFUSCATE
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
GROUPS
TRY
TO
READ
SOMETHING
INTO
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
CHANGE
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
JEHOVAHS
WITNESSES
DENY
THE
DEITY
OF
CHRIST
DOES
NOT
ALTER
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
LOOKING
FOR
THAT

THROUGH
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
GOD
AND
OUR

PETER
ON
THE

WE
FIRST
LOOK
TO
THE

TO
SEE
WHAT
IT
TEACHES
TO
DISCOUNT
OR
NOT
EVEN
ADDRESS
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
SOME
GROUPS
THAT
HAVE
DIFFERING
VIEWS
IS
SELFDEFEATING
TO
SEE
WHAT
THE

TEACHES
YOU
HAVE
TO
LOOK
AT
THE

THE
RA
ABOVE

ARE
BY
THE

BRUCE
R
MCCONKIE
A
FORMER
GENERAL
AUTHORITY
RA
OF
THE

CHURCH
THOSE

WERE
NOT
PUBLISHED
BY
THE

NOR
DO
RA
THEY
CONSTITUTE
OFFICAL

THEY
CONSIST
OF

NOW
RA
DOES
THAT

THAT
WHAT

SAYS
IS
NOT
TRUE
NOT
AT

ILL
HAVE
TO

THINK
ABOUT
THE

BEFORE

MAY

HERETICAL
TO

BUT
IM
PREPARED
TO
ACCEPT
THAT
I
FIND
THIS
RATHER
CURIOUS
WHEN
I
MENTIONED
THAT
THE

BELIEF
IS
THAT
JESUS
NEEDED
TO
BE
SAVED
I
PUT
FORWARD
SOME
QUOTES
FROM
THE

APOSTLE
BRUCE
MCCONKIE
THE
CURIOUS
PART
IS
THAT
NO
ONE
ADDRESSED
THE

RICK
COMES
THE

WITH

I
HAVE
MY

THE
POINT
MOST
OF
THE
OTHER
REPLIES
HAVE
INSTEAD
HOPSCOTCHED
TO

OF
BRUCE

AND
WHETHER

WERE

I
DONT

THAT
IT
MATTERS
IF

THAT
IS
NOT

WERE
MCCONKIES
WRITINGS
INDICATIVE
OF

BELIEF
ON

THE

THE

THAT
