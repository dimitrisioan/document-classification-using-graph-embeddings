RE
WHAT
RIGHT
JOAKIMRIFIUIONO
JOAKIM
RUUD
WRITES
RECENTLY
IVE
ASKED
MYSELF
A
RATHER
INTERESTING
QUESTION
WHAT
RIGHT
DOES
GOD
HAVE
ON
OUR
LIVES
ALWAYS
ASSUMING
THERE
IS
A
GOD
OF
COURSE
IN
HIS
INFINITE
WISDOM
HE
MADE
IT
PERFECTLY
CLEAR
THAT
IF
WE
DONT
LIVE
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
RULES
WE
WILL
BURN
IN
HELL
WELL
WITH
WHAT
RIGHT
CAN
GOD
MAKE
THAT
DESICION
LETS
SAY
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
THAT
GOD
CREATES
EVERY
ONE
OF
US
DIRECTLY
OR
INDIRECTLY
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
THEN
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
HE
FIRST
CREATES
US
AND
THEN
TURNS
US
LOSE
WELL
I
DIDNT
ASK
TO
BE
CREATED
I
GUESS
I
OUGHT
NOT
CONCLUDE
FROM
THIS
THEN
THAT
SINCE
YOU
DIDNT
ASK
TO
BE
CREATED
YOU
DONT
CARE
IF
YOU
GO
TO
HELL
LETS
MAKE
AN
ANALOGUE
IF
A
SCIENTIST
CREATES
A
UNIQUE
LIVING
CREATURE
WHICH
HAS
HAPPENED
IT
WAS
EVEN
PATENTED
DOES
HE
THEN
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
EXPECT
IT
TO
BEHAVE
IN
A
CERTAIN
MATTER
OR
DIE
WHO
IS
GOD
TO
IMPOSE
ITS
RULES
ON
US
WHO
CAN
TELL
IF
GOD
IS
REALLY
SO
RIGHTEOUS
AS
GOD
LIKES
US
TO
BELIEVE
ARE
ALL
CHRISTIANS
A
FLOCK
OF
SHEEP
UNABLE
TO
DO
OTHERWISE
THAT
FOLLOW
THE
REST
I
DONT
CONSIDER
MYSELF
AN
UNTHINKING
SHEEP
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
GOD
CREATED
US
TO
BE
IN
COMMUNION
AND
OBEDIENCE
TO
HIM
THE
FIRST
AND
ONLY
RULE
WAS
TO
NOT
EAT
OF
A
CERTAIN
TREE
OR
ELSE
THE
PUNISHMENT
IS
DISTANCE
FROM
HIM
AND
PHYSICAL
DEATH
GODS
INTENTION
IN
CREATING
US
IS
TO
HAVE
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
US
THE
BIBLE
DOCUMENTS
GODS
ATTEMPTS
TO
HAVE
THAT
RELATIONSHIP
CULMINATING
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
JESUS
TO
BEAR
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
ALL
SIN
SO
THAT
ALL
WHO
ACCEPT
HIM
CAN
HAVE
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
AGAIN
THE
PURPOSE
OF
CREATION
WHO
IS
GOD
TO
IMPOSE
RULES
ON
US
HES
GOD
AND
HE
CREATED
US
I
SUPPOSE
HE
HAS
A
RIGHT
BASED
ON
WHO
HE
IS
ABOVE
YOU
MENTION
IN
HIS
INFINITE
WISDOM
AND
THATS
WHAT
ID
SAY
GOD
EXEMPLIFIES
BUT
IF
YOU
WERE
BEING
SARCASTIC
UP
THERE
THEN
THIS
WHOLE
DISCUSSION
IS
IRRELEVANT
EH
AND
IF
WE
BELIEVE
GOD
IS
INFINITELY
WISE
THAT
BELIEF
SHOULD
INFORM
OUR
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
HIM
