the
term
myth
designates
traditionally
based
dramatic
narratives
on
themes
that
emphasize
the
nature
of
humankinds
relationship
to
nature
and
to
the
supernatural
legends
are
ususally
defined
as
tales
concerning
other
times
and
places
that
do
not
give
the
same
extensive
emphasis
to
supernatural
themes
legends
more
often
than
myths
are
retold
purely

now
doesnt
this

like
the

story
from

i
think
i
hear
what
youre
saying
but
im
not
convinced
that
i
know
what
you
mean
the
possibility
exists
that
what
looks
like
myth
on
the
surface
may
be
after
all
much
more
than
just
a
story
