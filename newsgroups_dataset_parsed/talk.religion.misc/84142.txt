re
is
it
good
that
jesus
died
jesus
this
is
the
verdict
light
has
come
into
the
world
but
men
loved
darkness
instead
of
light
because
their
deeds
are
evil
everyone
who
does
evil
hates
the
light
and
will
not
come
into
the
light
for
fear
that
his
deeds
will
be
exposed
kent
sandvik
says
it
seems
we
are
dealing
with
a
blackandwhite
interpretation
brian
are
you
subtly
accusing
me
of
evil
things
because
i
never
saw
the
light
however
this
is
even
more
confusing
because
i
even
admit
that
i
dont
like
the
situation
where
im
not
informed
black
and
white
a
spade
is
a
spade
there
is
no
hidden
agenda
behind
this
so
stop
trying
to
look
for
one
it
is
an
easy
and
as
straight
forward
as
it
reads
kent
i
am
not
accusing
you
of
evil
things
jesus
is
accusing
you
and
it
is
not
only
you
that
he
is
accusing
he
is
accusing
everyone
me
you
and
everyone
in
the
world
is
guilty
whether
one
sees
the
light
or
does
not
seen
the
light
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
we
do
evil
things
we
do
them
regardless
jesus
uses
the
word
men
i
am
included
jesus
is
not
soloing
you
out
jesus
is
making
a
general
statement
about
out
the
sad
state
of
man
christians
are
not
immuned
from
doing
evil
things
a
christian
is
just
a
person
in
whom
the
holy
spirit
indwells
a
christian
can
see
the
evil
he
is
doingbecause
his
evil
has
been
brought
out
into
the
light
jesus
is
not
saying
that
just
because
evil
has
been
exposed
that
the
christian
will
stop
doing
evil
if
you
havent
seen
jesuss
light
your
evil
deeds
simply
havent
been
exposed
to
the
his
light
you
may
shed
some
light
on
your
own
your
human
spirit
shines
at
perhaps
candela
but
the
holy
spirit
shines
at
a
megacandela
the
holy
spirit
can
shine
light
into
places
inside
us
where
we
didnt
even
know
existed
so
do
you
see
jesuss
point
christians
are
not
perfect
nonchristians
are
not
perfect
nonchristians
do
not
want
to
come
into
the
light
of
jesus
because
they
will
see
all
the
problems
in
their
lives
and
they
will
not
like
the
sight
it
is
an
ugly
thing
to
see
how
far
we
have
fallen
from
jesuss
perspective
do
you
think
you
want
to
know
how
really
ignorant
you
are
do
you
think
brian
kendig
wants
to
know
do
you
think
i
want
to
know
ego
verses
the
truth
which
do
you
choose
im
watching
the
news
about
a
man
who
saw
the
light
and
made
sure
that
the
children
burned
to
death
as
part
of
his
insight
into
the
light
i
dont
think
the
world
is
that
simple
and
if
you
act
in
such
ways
when
you
are
enlighted
then
im
a
happy
man
and
i
pray
i
will
never
receive
such
light
and
i
watched
koresh
too
an
imposter
who
thought
he
saw
the
light
who
made
sure
that
the
children
burned
to
death
sadly
as
part
of
his
delusion
it
is
even
sadder
that
the
people
who
died
with
him
chose
to
die
with
them
and
that
ignorance
was
their
downfall
to
death
and
kent
dont
you
bury
yourself
underneath
a
rock
with
an
excuse
like
bringing
up
koreshas
if
koresh
actually
had
truth
in
him
david
koresh
was
no
light
and
no
excuse
for
you
to
stay
away
from
the
real
jesus
christ
david
koresh
who
claimed
to
be
jesus
was
a
fraud
it
was
obvious
david
koresh
was
born
in
america
jesus
was
born
in
bethlehem
koresh
wasnt
even
a
good
imposter
having
missed
an
obvious
point
as
that
jesus
warned
of
such
imposters
in
the
endtimes
david
koresh
wasnt
anything
new
to
jesus
jesus
told
us
to
be
aware
of
imposters
years
ago
so
the
next
time
an
imposter
makes
a
scene
and
claims
to
be
jesus
ask
the
obvious
where
were
you
born
was
your
mothers
name
mary
if
the
branch
davidians
asked
that
simple
question
they
would
have
labeled
koresh
a
liar
right
from
the
start
the
wouldnt
have
followed
koresh
they
wouldnt
have
died
but
look
what
happened
their
ignorance
cost
them
their
lives
their
choice
to
be
ignorant
cost
them
a
lot
kent
since
you
studied
the
bible
under
lutheranism
do
you
not
remember
what
tactic
satan
used
to
try
to
tempt
jesus
did
not
satan
quote
the
bible
out
of
context
do
you
remember
what
tactic
the
serpent
of
genesis
used
to
tempt
eve
did
he
not
misquote
god
what
satan
used
on
eve
and
succeeded
was
the
same
ploy
he
tried
on
jesus
but
in
jesuss
case
jesus
rebuked
satan
back
with
the
bible
in
context
it
didnt
work
with
jesus
does
what
satan
did
to
eve
in
the
garden
and
what
satan
tried
to
do
with
jesus
in
the
desert
remind
you
of
what
koresh
did
to
his
followers
who
did
koresh
emulate
who
was
koreshs
teacher
koresh
did
to
his
followers
what
satan
did
to
eve
did
not
koresh
kill
his
followersr
did
not
satan
cause
adam
and
eve
to
die
as
well
did
not
the
cult
followers
believe
koresh
even
though
they
knew
the
real
christ
was
born
in
bethlehem
did
not
eve
choose
to
eat
from
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
despite
knowing
that
it
would
cause
her
death
god
held
them
all
responsibledeceiver
and
the
rebeller
none
of
them
had
an
excuse
as
opposed
to
the
branch
davidians
we
have
a
second
chance
follow
jesus
and
he
will
escort
us
to
the
path
of
eternal
life
dont
follow
jesus
and
you
stand
condemned
already
for
like
the
branch
davidian
complex
your
house
is
already
on
fire
satan
adam
and
eve
have
already
set
it
ablaze
it
is
just
a
slow
burn
but
it
is
burning
nevertheless
