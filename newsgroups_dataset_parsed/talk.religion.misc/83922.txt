ROBERT
WEISS
WRITES
NO
CHURCH
WILL
ADMIT
THAT
I
AM
RIGHT
EXCEPT
THE
ONE
WITH
WHICH
I
AM
ASSOCIATED
THIS
MAKES
THEM
WITNESSES
AGAINST
EACH
OTHER
AND
HOW
CAN
I
DECIDE
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
AS
THIS
SEEING
THEY
ARE
ALL
UNLIKE
THE
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
AS
IT
EXISTED
IN
FORMER
DAYS
P
THE
IDEA
OF
AN
APOSTACY
DID
NOT
ORIGINATE
WITH
LUCY
SMITH
OR
JOSEPH
SMITH
OR
THE
MORMONS
THE
IDEA
OF
A
RESTORATION
WAS
QUITE
COMMON

THE
EARLY
CENTURY
USA

CAMPBELL

DISCIPLES
OF

PREACHED
THAT

PRIMITIVE

HAD
BEEN
LOST
AND
WAS
ATTEMPTING
TO
RESTORE

YOU
CAN
FIND
SUCH
SENTIMENTS
IN
MANY
OF
THE
EARLY
PROTESTANTS
OF
THE
REFORMATION
SUCH
AS
MARTIN
LUTHER
GORDON
BANKS
SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND

IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
