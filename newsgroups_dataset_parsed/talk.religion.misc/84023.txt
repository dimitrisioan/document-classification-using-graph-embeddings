PETE
YADLOWSKY
WRITES
DIDNT
CHRIST
TELL
HIS
DISCIPLES
TO
ARM
THEM
SELVES
SHORTLY
BEFORE
HIS
CRUSIFICTION
I
BELIEVE
THE
EXACT
QUOTE
WAS
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
IF
YOU
HAVE
SOMETHING
SELL
IT
AND
BUY
A
SWORD
THIS
FROM
A
GUY
WHO
PREACHED
LOVE
DEFERENCE
OF
POWER
TO
GOD
AND
RENUNCIATION
OF
WORLDLY
LIFE
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
A
LIFE
OF
THE
SPIRIT
IF
JESUS
DID
IN
FACT
COMMAND
HIS
DISCIPLES
TO
ARM
THEMSELVES
I
WOULD
TAKE
THAT
AS
YET
ANOTHER
REASON
TO
REJECT
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
FOR
WHATEVER
ITS
WORTH
LIKE
MOST
RELIGIONS
THE
DOCTRINE
HAS
GOOD
AND
BAD
IN
IT
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
REJECT
THE
CURRENT
IMPLEMENTATIONS
OF
THE
DOCTRINE
NO
THE
ABOVE
IS
A
CLASSIC
EXAMPLE
OF
TAKING
A
SCRIPTURE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
ITS
TAKEN
FROM
LUKE
BUT
NOTE
VS
FOR
I
TELL
YOU
THAT
THIS
WHICH
IS
WRITTEN
MUST
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
IN
ME
NAMELY
AND
HE
WILL
BE
RECKONED
WITH
LAWLESS
ONES
HE
THEN
STATED
THAT
TWO
SWORDS
WERE
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
GROUP
TO
CARRY
TO
BE
COUNTED
AS
LAWLESS
SO
HAVING
MORE
THAN
THE
POLITICALLY
CORRECT
NUMBER
OF
WEAPONS
WAS
CAUSE
TO
BE
ARRESED
AND
KILLED
EVEN
THEN
HUH
JESUS
OVERIDING
MESSAGE
WAS
ONE
OF
PEACE
TURN
OTHER
CHEEK
LIVE
BY
SWORD
DIE
BY
SWORD
ETC
YES
OF
COURSE
AS
IN
MATTHEW
DO
NOT
SUPPOSE
THAT
I
HAVE
COME
TO
BRING
PEACE
TO
THE
EARTH
IT
IS
NOT
PEACE
I
HAVE
COME
TO
BRING
BUT

SWORD
