FLAMING

AND
HIS
BUDDIES
WERE
ACCUSED
OF
BEING
FLAMING
FAGGOTS
ONE
OF
THE
PRETEXTS
FOR
THE
NIGHT
OF
LONG
KNIVES
IN
WHICH
ROEHM
AND
MOST
OF
THE
SA
WING
OF
THE
NSDAP
WERE

THE
ACCUSERS
THEREAFTER
CONTROLLED
THE
RECORDS
ANYTHING
BEARING
ON
THE
SUBJECT
TRUE
OR
NOT
HAS
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
TAINTED
EVIDENCE
THE
AVAILABLE
DATA
SUGGEST
THAT
ROEHM
AND
HIS
CROWD
THE
SA
STURMABTEILUNG
STORM
TROOPERS
LEFT
THE
WORLD
A
BETTER
PLACE
WHEN
THEY
DEPARTED
BUT
CONCRETE
PARTICULARS
ARE
STILL
NO
MORE
THAN
MORE
OR
LESS
