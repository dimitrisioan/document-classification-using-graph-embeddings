AFTER
YEARS
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY

JON
LIVESEY
WRITES
DO
YOU
MEAN
ITS
MORAL
TO
USE
FORCE
ON
SOMEONE
WHO
ADVOCATES
THE
USE
OF
FORCE
WITH
A
FEW
PROVISOS
YES
MINIMUM
FORCE
FOR
A
START
AND
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
IS
BEING
FORCED
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OR
DO
YOU
MEAN
THAT
SOMETIMES
WE
HAVE
TO
USE
FORCE
ON
SUCH
PEOPLE
OUT
OF
NECESSITY
OR
SELFDEFENCE
WHILE
RECOGNIZING
THAT
OUR
OWN
ACTIONS
IN
DOING
SO
ARE
NOT
MORAL
MY
OPINION
IS
THAT
OUR
ACTIONS
WOULD
BE
MORAL
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
IMMORAL
NOT
TO
ACT
IF
ACTION
WOULD
BE
BOTH
NECESSARY
AND
EFFECTIVE
AGAIN
THERE
MANY
CAVEATS
AND
PROVISIOS
NOTE
MY
USAGE
OF
MY
OPINION
IS
AN
ADMISSION
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
A
LOCK
ON
MORALS
NOT
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
TRUTH
ABOUT
MORALITY
TO
HAVE
A
LOCK
ON
YOURE
ADMITTING
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THAT
YOU
ARE
ADMITTING
THAT
YOUR
MORALS
ARE
SITUATIONAL
YOU
ARE
ADMITTING
THAT
THE
ACTIONS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
AND
THE
SITUATION
YOU
ARE
IN
HELP
TO
DETERMINE
HOW
YOU
JUDGE
THE
MORAL
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
ONE
OF
YOUR
OWN
ACTIONS
IF
YOU
EMPLOY
X
DEGREE
OF
FORCE
THATS
NOT
MORAL
BUT
IF
YOU
EMPLOY
X
DEGREE
OF
FORCE
BUT
PREVIOUSLY
SOMEONE
ELSE
HAS
EMPLOYED
Y
DEGREE
OF
FORCE
AND
THE
SITUATION
IS
THUSANDSO
THAT
IS
MORAL
THIS
IS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
SAYING
EMPLOYING
FORCE
ON
OTHER
PEOPLE
IS
IMMORAL
PERIOD
UNFORTUNATELY
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
WE
ARE
OBLIGED
TO
DO
THIS
IMMORAL
THING
FOR
REASONS
OF
SELFPRESERVATION
AND
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
BEAR
THE
MORAL
CONSEQUENCES
OF
THAT
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
AND
YES
I
KNOW
YOU
CLAIM
TO
BE
AN
AGNOSTIC
ITS
THIS
ABILITY
TO
RELABEL
THINGS
FROM
IMMORAL
TO
MORAL
THAT
I
FIND
ONE
OF
THE
LEAST
ATTRACTIVE
QUALITIES
OF
THE
RELIGIOUS
MIND
