is
isaiah
moreover
the
light
of
the
moon
shall
be
as
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
light
of
the
sun
shall
be
sevenfold
as
the
light
of
seven
days
in
the
day
that
the
lord
bindeth
up
the
breach
of
his
people
and
healeth
the
stroke
of
their
wound
so
we
have
to
wait
for
the
sun
to
nova
more
along
the
lines
of
hebrews
i
reckon
see
that
you
refuse
not
him
that
speaks
for
if
they
escaped
not
who
refused
him
that
spake
on
earth
much
more
shall
not
we
escape
if
we
turn
away
from
him
that
speaks
from
heaven
whose
voice
then
shook
the
earth
but
now
he
has
promised
saying
yet
once
more
i
shake
not
the
earth
only
but
also
heaven
and
this
word
yet
once
more
signifies
the
removing
of
those
things
that
are
shaken
as
of
things
that
are
made
that
those
things
which
cannot
be
shaken
may
remain
wherefore
we
receiving
a
kingdom
which
cannot
be
moved
let
us
have
grace
whereby
we
may
serve
god
acceptably
with
reverence
and
godly
fear
for
our
god
is
a
consuming
fire
or
thessalonians
and
to
you
who
are
troubled
rest
with
us
when
the
lord
jesus
shall
be
revealed
from
heaven
with
his
mighty
angels
in
flaming
fire
taking
vengeance
on
them
that
know
not
god
and
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
from
the
glory
of
his
power
when
he
shall
come
to
be
glorified
in
his
saints
and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that
believe
because
our
testimony
among
you
was
believed
in
that
day
kinda
gives
flaming
a
whole
new
meaning
i
reckon
the
impression
i
got
from
talking
with
livingston
was
that
the
coming
of
the
lord
powerwise
is
going
to
be
something
that
those
who
are
unprepared
cant
handle
kinda
like
overloading
a
fuse
due
to
guilt
somehow
it
seems
to
also
apply
to
the
entire
physical
world
as
we
know
it
lf
suggests
that
god
doesnt
want
that
and
has
sent
koresh
as
a
reminder
seems
that
those
who
have
been
purified
through
salvation
or
that
those
protected
by
the
seals
will
be
the
ones
who
survive
and
no
i
dont
have
a
good
idea
yet
what
being
shielded
by
the
seals
actually
involves
or
how
exactly
it
relates
to
salvation
other
than
it
involves
the
marriage
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
for
those
of
you
biblical
well
versed
me
personally
im
totally
dependent
on
god
through
christ
so
if
god
wants
me
to
understand
good
if
not
also
good
if
god
wants
to
save
me
or
dispose
of
me
thats
great
either
way
being
born
in
the
spirit
means
being
part
of
the
body
of
christ
ephesians
so
who
and
what
i
was
matters
little
whats
important
is
loving
god
come
nova
nuke
or
apocalypse
who
cares
satan
might
even
be
able
to
pull
off
a
pretty
convincing
fake
big
deal
not
worth
fearing
or
worrying
about
though
not
before
the
greater
glory
of
god
maybe
koresh
is
right
maybe
he
isnt
and
it
should
be
interesting
to
see
the
new
message
or
prophecy
the
tour
of
the
bible
ive
taken
in
studying
the
passages
he
points
to
in
the
text
has
been
most
re
warding
but
the
test
of
prophecy
is
still
the
fruit
it
bears
which
is
not
yet
clear
much
much
more
important
is
charity
which
by
definition
is
love
for
god
i
hope
dear
reader
youve
taken
all
this
as
an
expression
of
faith
and
not
a
statement
of
mere
fact
seems
many
folks
get
real
upset
at
reminders
