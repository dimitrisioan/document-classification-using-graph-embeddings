I
UNDERSTAND
AND
SYMPATHIZE
WITH
YOUR
PAIN
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WACO
WAS
A
VERY
SAD
TRADGEDY
DONT
TAKE
IT
OUT
ON
US
CHRISTIANS
THOUGH
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
WERE
NOT
AN
ORGANIZED
RELIGION
THEY
WERE
A
CULT
LED
BY
A
EGOMANIAC
CULT
LEADER
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
STANDS
ONLY
ON
THE
SHOULDERS
OF
ONE
MAN
THE
LORD
OF
LORDS
AND
KING
OF
KINGS
JESUS
CHRIST
BTW
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
NOT
JESUS
CHRIST
AS
HE
CLAIMED
THE
INTERESTING
NOTION
IS
THAT
I
WATCHED
TV
TONIGHT
KORESH
NEVER
CLAIMED
OFFICIALLY
TO
BE
JESUS
CHRIST
HIS
BELIEVERS
HOPED
THAT
HE
WOULD
BE
BUT
HE
NEVER
TOOK
THIS
STANDPOINT
HIMSELF
HE
WAS
MORE
INTERESTED
IN
BREAKING
THE
SEVEN
SEALS
OF
REVELATION
AND
MAKE
SURE
THAT
ARMAGEDDON
WOULD
START
WELL
IT
DID
AND
CHILDREN
DIED
AND
NO
GOD
SAVED
