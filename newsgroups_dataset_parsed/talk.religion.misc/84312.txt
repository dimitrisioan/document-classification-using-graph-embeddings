UNLESS
YOU
DIDNT
REALIZE
IT
YOU
ARE
JUST
NOW
INVOLVED
IN
A
DEBATE
WHERE
WE
HAVE
VARIOUS
OPINIONS
AND
EACH
ENTITY
HAS
ITS
OWN
FRAME
WHERE
THE
OPINION
IS
EXPRESSED
I
THINK
I
DONT
NEED
TO
STATE
THE
DREADFUL
RWORD
SO
ITS
SOMETIMES
CORRECT
TO
SAY
THAT
MORALITY
IS
OBJECTIVE
OR
WHAT
IF
YOU
WERE
ABLE
TO
PROVE
THAT
MORALITY
IS
OBJECTIVE
THEN
IT
WOULD
BE
CORRECT
TO
DO
SO
THE
PROBLEM
IS
BY
THE
VERY
MEANING
OF
THE
WORDS
IN
QUESTION
TO
DO
SO
IS
OXYMORONIC
OF
COURSE
YOU
COULD
REDEFINE
THE
WORDS
BUT
THAT
WOULD
STILL
NOT
LEND
SUPPORT
TO
THE
UNDERLYING
CONCEPT
AFTER
ALL
I
COULD
HARDLY
BE
WRONG
WITHOUT
DRAGGING
IN
THE
OWORD
THIS
DOES
NOT
PARSE
HOW
COULD
YOU
HARDLY
BE
WRONG
WITHOUT
DRAGGING
IN
THE
OWORD
FOR
YOUR
PART
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
RELATIVISM
IS
TRUE
THATS
JUST
YOUR
OPINION
WHY
DO
FOLK
GET
SO
HEATED
THEN
IF
A
BELIEF
IN
RELATIVISM
IS
MERELY
A
MATTER
OF
TASTE
TO
BE
FAIR
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
CALM
I
GET
THE
IMPRESSION
THATS
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
NOTIONS
OF
OBJECTIVITY
IN
ANY
FLAVOUR
RIGHT
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
OBJECTIVITY
AT
ALL
IT
IS
MY
OBJECTIVITY
THAT
HAS
LED
ME
TO
CONCLUDE
THAT
MORALITY
IS
SUBJECTIVE
