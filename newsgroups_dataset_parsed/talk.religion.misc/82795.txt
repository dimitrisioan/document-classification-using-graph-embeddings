PSYROBTWUBVMSBCCBUFFALOEDU
WROTE
LOTS
OF
STUFF
ABOUT
THE
NICENE
CREED
DELETED
WHICH
CAN
BE
READ
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
BASENOTE
I
WILL
ALSO
LEAVE
IT
UP
TO
OTHER
LDS
NETTERS
TO
TAKE
MR
WEISS
TO
TASK
ON
USING
MORMON
DOCTRINE
TO
DECLARE
THE
DIFINITIVE
WORD
ON
WHAT
THE
LDS
CHURCH
TEACHES
AS
DOCTRINE
HOPEFULLY
THE
LDS
NETTERS
WILL
BE
AMIABLE
IN
THEIR
EXPLANATION
SINCE
IT
WOULD
DO
NO
GOOD
TO
REBUT
WHAT
MR
WEISS
HAS
STATED
ON
THE
ORIGIN
OF
THE
NICENE
CREED
AND
ITS
STATUS
AS
DEVINE
AND
INSPIRED
I
SAY
NO
GOOD
BECAUSE
IT
CANNOT
BE
PROVED
THROUGH
DISCUSSION
OR
DEBATE
AS
TO
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
AUTHORS
OF
THE
CREED
WERE
INSPIRED
I
LEAVE
YOU
IT
WILL
BE
SOME
TIME
BEFORE
I
POST
AGAIN
WITH
THE
FOLLOWING
THOUGHT
AUTHORED
BY
EUGENE
ENGLAND
PROFESSOR
OF
ENGLISH
AT
BRIGHAM
YOUNG
UNIVERSITY
MR
ENGLAND
WROTE
THE
FOLLOWING
AS
PART
OF
A
BOOK
REVIEW
SECTION
IN
THIS
PEOPLES
MAGAZINE
SPRING
EDITION
I
CONCLUDE
WITH
A
LITTLE
SERMON
BECAUSE
I
BELIEVE
WE
WILL
NOT
BE
A
MORMON
OR
HUMANFAMILY
UNTIL
WE
CAN
GET
OVER
LABELING
AND
REJECTING
EACH
OTHER
WITH
TERMS
LIKE
FEMINIST
OR
PATRIARCHAL
LIBERAL
OR
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIAN
OR
NONCHRISTIAN
HAL
WHEN
WE
ARE
TEMPTED
TO
DRAW
A
CIRCLE
AROUND
A
SET
OF
BELIEFS
AND
TRADITIONS
AND
STYLES
AND
CALL
IT
AMERICAN
THEN
EXCLUDE
THOSE
WHO
DONT
FIT
IT
MAY
BE
WELL
TO
CONSIDER
THAT
PERHAPS
THE
MOST
CENTRAL
DEFINING
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
A
GOOD
AMERICAN
MIGHT
BE
ONE
WHO
DOESNT
DRAW
EXCLUSIVE
CIRCLES
THAT
THE
SUREST
WAY
OF
EXCLUDING
OURSELVES
FROM
THE
CENTRAL
AMERICAN
IDEAL
IS
BY
EXCLUDING
OTHERS
AND
WHEN
WE
ARE
TEMPTED
TO
DRAW
A
CIRCLE
AROUND
MORMON
OR
CHRISTIAN
TO
DECIDE
WHO
IS
ORTHODOX
AND
WHO
ISNT
BY
HOW
MUCH
THEY
AGREE
WITH
US
IT
MIGHT
BE
WELL
TO
CONSIDER
THAT
THE
CENTRAL
PILLAR
OF
CHRISTS
ORTHODOXY
IS
OUR
ABILITY
TO
LOVE
UNCONDITIONALLY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
DIFFERENT
AND
INCLUDE
THEM
IN
OUR
FAMILY
I
RECENTLY
SPENT
SOME
TIME
IN
A
CHRISTIAN
BOOKSTORE
IN
CALIFORNIA
THE
SERVICE
WAS
EXCELLENT
THE
CLERKS
AND
CUSTOMERS
ALL
SMILING
NEAT
AND
WELLSCRUBBED
AND
THERE
WERE
THE
EXPECTED
WHOLESOME
OFFERINGS
OF
SCRIPTURAL
COMMENTARIES
SENTIMENTAL
FICTION
AND
COLLECTIONS
OF
EVANGELISTIC
SERMONS
BUT
I
WAS
DISMAYED
TO
FIND
HOW
MUCH
SHELF
SPACE
WAS
GIVEN
TO
ATTACKING
OTHERS
OFTEN
VICIOUSLYWHETHER
THE
POLITICAL
LEFT
OUR
MODERN
AMERICAN
CULTURE
OR
OTHER
RELIGIONS
A
WHOLE
SECTION
WAS
DEVOTED
TO
CULTS
AND
THE
OCCULT
AND
AS
YOU
MIGHT
EXPECT
MORMONISM
WAS
RIGHT
THERE
UNDER
THE
SAME
RUBRIC
AND
INDICTMENT
OFTEN
BY
THE
SAME
AUTHORS
AS
SATANISM
AND
I
FOUND
I
COULD
EITHER
RENT
OR
BUY
IN
ENGLISH
OR
SPANISH
COPIES
OF
THE
GOD
MAKERS
THAT
ABSURDLY
INACCURATE
EVEN
LIBELOUS
BUT
VERY
POPULAR
AND
DANGEROUS
ANTIMORMON
FILM
THAT
USES
EXACLTY
THE
SAME
TECHNIQUES
AND
EVEN
ACCUSATIONS
OF
THE
NAZI
FILMS
THAT
SCAPEGOATED
JEWS
IN
THE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
ONE
MAJOR
INDICATION
THAT
A
PERSON
IS
A
GENUINE
CONVERT
TO
CHRIST
AND
HIS
REDEMPTIVE
LOVE
IS
HIS
LACK
OF
PARANOIA
AND
ANXIETY
PERFECT
LOVE
CASTETH
OUT
FEAR
I
JOHN
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
PLEASED
THAT
THE
LDS
CHURCH
HAS
NOT
ENGAGED
IN
ATTACKS
ON
OTHER
FAITHS
THOUGH
I
FIND
A
DISHEARTENING
INCREASE
IN
WILLINGNESS
OF
INDIVIDUAL
MORMONS
TO
ENGAGE
IN
THE
SAME
KINDS
OF
STEREOTYPING
AND
SCAPEGOATINGAND
EVEN
THREATS
OF
COERCIVE
ACTIONAS
THE
RELIGIOUS
RIGHT
WING
HAS
LAUNCHED
THIS
YEAR
AGAINST
THE
POLITICAL
LEFT
AND
AMERICAN
CULTURAL
AND
RELIGIOUS
STYLES
THEY
DONT
LIKE
IT
IS
A
FEARFUL
IRONY
THAT
IN
SO
DOING
MORMONS
TAKE
COMMON
CAUSE
WITH
THE
VERY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
MOST
SLANDEROUSLY
ATTACKED
MORMONSPEOPLE
WHO
WOULD
IF
THEY
HAD
POWER
FORCEFULLY
RESTRICT
MORMONS
RIGHTS
ALONG
WITH
THOSE
OF
OTHERS
THEY
BELIEVE
TO
BE
EVIL
THE
ABOVE
SERMON
WAS
ADDRESSED
TO
THE
LDS
AUDIENCE
WHO
USUALLY
SUBSCRIBE
TO
THIS
PEOPLES
MAGAZINE
BUT
WOULD
CERTAINLY
APPLY
TO
ALL
OF
US
WHO
RELY
ON
THE
MERCIES
AND
GRACE
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
TO
BRING
US
BACK
INTO
HIS
ARMS
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
LDS
CHURCH
CLAIMS
DEVINE
AUTHORITY
TO
EXERCISE
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
THE
RESTORED
GOSPELAS
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
CHRIST
THE
CHURCH
DOES
NOT
CLAIM
PERFECTION
AND
INFALLIBILITY
IN
HOW
THOSE
WITH
AUTHORITATIVE
STATUS
HAVE
OR
DO
NOW
LEAD
THE
CHURCH
I
FOR
ONE
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
BE
LABELLED
CHRISTIAN
IF
THOSE
WHO
PROFESS
THEMSELVES
AS
CHRISTIANS
ATTACK
MY
BELIEFS
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
INTOLLERENT
FOR
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
WAY
MY
RELIGION
MAY
INTERPRET
BIBLICAL
SCRIPTURES
OF
THE
SAME
SOURCE
TO
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
MEANING
AND
IMPLICATION
THAN
MAINSTREAM
CHRISTIANITY
WOULD
GIVE
IT
ONCE
AGAIN
BEING
IN
THE
MAJORITY
DOES
NOT
IN
AND
OF
ITSELF
PROVE
ANYTHING
EXCEPT
THAT
YOUR
COLLECTIVE
VOICE
IS
LOUDER
THATS
REALLY
ALL
THE
CRITICS
OF
THE
LDS
CHURCH
HAVE
TO
STAND
ON
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
KIND
OF
BIBLICAL
INTERPRETATION
USED
AS
PROOF
TO
COUNTER
THE
LDS
CHURCH
INTERPRETATION
USING
SOMEONE
ELSES
BIASED
RESEARCH
OF
TRUTHS
AND
NONTRUTHS
WHOSE
TO
SAY
WHAT
THE
MIXTURE
IS
AS
AN
AUTHORITATIVE
TOOL
TO
DISPROVE
OR
DISCREDIT
IS
NOT
BEING
FAIR
TO
ANYONE
LEAST
OF
ALL
THEMSELVES
LET
US
SIMPLY
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
AND
SHARE
BELIEFS
THROUGH
ADULT
DISCUSSION
AND
