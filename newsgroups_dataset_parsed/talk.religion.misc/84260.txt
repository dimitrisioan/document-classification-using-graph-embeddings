I
AM
ALSO
UNHAPPY
OR
ACTUALLY
VERY
SUSPICIOUS
THAT
THE
FBI
WAS
DISMISSING
OUT
OF
HAND
ANY
CHANCES
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
ACCIDENTALLY
SET
THE
BLAZE
THEMSELVES
I
MEAN
I
GUESS
WE
ARE
JUST
SUPPOSED
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
RAMMING
MODIFIED
TANKS
INTO
THE
WALLS
OF
A
BUILDING
AND
INJECTING
TOXIC
GASES
INTO
THE
BUILDING
ARE
JUST
ROUTINE
PROCEDURES
NO
WAY
ANYTHING
COULD
GO
WRONG
MY
CORE
POINT
WAS
AND
STILL
IS
THAT
CHILDREN
DIED
AND
MR
KORESH
COULD
JUST
HAVE
OPENED
THE
DOOR
AND
ASKED
THE
CHILDREN
TO
GO
OUT
BEFORE
ALL
THIS
HAPPENED
YOU
MIGHT
BLAIM
FBI
ATF
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
SATAN
PEPSI
COKE
OR
ANYTHING
ELSE
BUT
YOU
CANT
AVOID
THE
FACT
THAT
ONE
SINGLE
ACTION
WOULD
HAVE
SAVED
SMALL
CHILDREN
FROM
A
DREADFUL
AND
PAINFUL
DEATH
WELL
MR
KORESH
ALLOWED
OTHER
CHILDREN
AND
ADULTS
TO
LEAVE
THE
COMPOUND
DURING
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
SIEGE
WHY
DIDNT
THESE
CHILDREN
LEAVE
THEN
I
DONT
KNOW
MYSELF
AND
CERTAINLY
HAVENT
HEARD
ANY
ANSWERS
ON
THIS
HERE
YES
ONE
SIMPLE
NONACTION
IE
NOT
ATTACKING
THE
COMPOUND
WITH
MODIFIED
TANKS
WOULD
HAVE
PREVENTED
THIS
TRAGEDY
I
BET
YOU
BLAMED
THE
MOVE
PEOPLE
FOR
THE
DEATHS
THAT
OCCURRED
IN
ADJACENT
ROW
HOUSES
IN
PHILADELPHIA
NOT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WHICH
DROPPED
THE
FIREBOMB
RIGHT
LEGALIZE
FREEDOM
