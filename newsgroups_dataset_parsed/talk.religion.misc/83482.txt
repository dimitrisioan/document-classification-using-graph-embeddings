WRITES
RICK
ANDERSON
REPLIED
TO
MY
LETTER
WITH
RA
IN

RA

ROBERT
WEISS
SAYS
RA
JUST
BRIEFLY
ON
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
IN
PASSING
YOU
REFER
TO
DIFFERING
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
CREATE
AND
SAY
THAT
MANY
CHRISTIANS
MAY
NOT
AGREE
SO
WHAT
THAT
IS
REALLY
IRRELEVANT
WE
DO
NOT
BASE
OUR
FAITH
ON
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
THINK
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
DO
WE
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
TRUTH
REGARDLESS
OF
POPULARITY
OF
OPINIONS
IT
MAY
BE
IRRELEVANT
TO
YOU
AND
YOUR
PERSONAL
BELIEFS
OR
SHOULD
I
SAY
BIAS
BUT
IT
IS
RELEVANT
TO
ME
AND
MANY
OTHERS
YOURE
RIGHT
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
TRUTH
INDEPENDANT
FROM
YOU
OR
ANYONE
ELSE
SINCE
YOU
PROCLAIM
TRUTHS
AS
A
SELFPROCLAIMED
APPOINTEE
MAY
I
ASK
YOU
BY
WHAT
AUTHORITY
YOU
DO
THIS
BECAUSE
IT
SAYS
SO
IN
THE
BIBLE
DOES
THE
BIBLE
SAY
SO
OR
IS
IT
YOU
OR
SOMEONE
ELSE
WHO
INTERPRETS
WHETHER
A
SCRIPTURE
OR
DOCTRINE
CONFORMS
TO
YOUR
PARTICULAR
LIKING
OR
DISAPPROVAL
EXCUSE
MOI
BUT
YOUR
LINE
OF
TRUTHS
HAVENT
MOVED
ME
ONE
BIT
TO
PERSUADE
ME
THAT
MY
BELIEFS
ARE
ERRONEOUS
OF
ALL
THE
PREACHERS
OF
TRUTH
ON
THIS
NET
YOU
HAVE
STRUCK
ME
AS
A
SELFRIGHTEOUS
MEMBER
OF
THE
WRECKING
CREW
WITH
NO
POSITIVE
MESSAGE
TO
ME
OR
OTHER
LATTERDAY
SAINTS
WHATSOEVER
BTW
THIS
ENTIRE
DISCUSSION
REMINDS
ME
A
LOT
OF
THE
THINGS
SAID
BY
JESUS
TO
THE
PHARISEES
YE
HYPOCRITES
YE
PREACH
ABOUT
ME
WITH
YOUR
LIPS
BUT
YOUR
HEARTS
ARE
FAR
REMOVED
FROM
ME
ALSO
I
FIND
IT
RATHER
STRANGE
THAT
IN
TRYING
TO
PERSUADE
THAT
CREATED
AND
ETERNALLY
EXISTENT
ARE
EQUIVALENT
YOU
SAY
GRANTED
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
YOU
CANT
GRANT
YOUR
CONCLUSION
AND
THEN
EXPECT
THE
POINT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
ADDRESSED
IN
ORDER
TO
REPLY
TO
THE
ISSUE
YOU
HAVE
TO
ADDRESS
AND
ANSWER
THE
POINT
THAT
WAS
RAISED
AND
NOT
JUST
JUMP
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
YOU
GRANT
SOPHISTRY
LOOK
WHOS
TALKING
JUMPING
TO
CONCLUSIONS
YOU
WOULDNT
DO
THAT
YOURSELF
RIGHT
ALL
YOU
ADDRESS
IS
YOUR
OWN
CONVICTIONS
REGARDLESS
WHETHER
WE
COME
UP
WITH
ANY
BIBLICAL
SCRIPTURES
WHICH
SUPPORTS
OUR
POINTS
OF
VIEW
BECAUSE
YOU
REJECT
SUCH
INTERPRETATIONS
WITHOUT
ANY
CONSIDERATION
WHATSOEVER
THE
BIBLE
STATES
THAT
LUCIFER
WAS
CREATED
THE
BIBLE
STATES
THAT
JESUS
IS
THE
CREATOR
OF
ALL
THE
CONTRADICTION
THAT
WE
HAVE
IS
THAT
THE
LDS
BELIEF
IS
THAT
JESUS
AND
LUCIFER
WERE
THE
SAME
A
BEAUTIFUL
EXAMPLE
OF
DISINFORMATION
AND
A
DELIBERATE
MISREPRESENTATION
OF
LDS
DOCTRINE
THE
FORMER
KGB
WOULD
HAVE
LOVED
TO
EMPLOY
YOU
JESUS
AND
LUCIFER
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
SILLY
AND
YOU
KNOW
IT
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
IS
THAT
ALL
ARE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
LITERALLY
THERE
IS
NOTHING
SYMBOLIC
ABOUT
IT
THIS
HOWEVER
CONTRADICTS
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THAT
NOT
EVERYONE
IS
A
CHILD
OF
GOD
CORRECTION
IT
MAY
CONTRADICT
WOULD
YOU
THINK
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THE
BIBLE
INDEED
DOES
TEACH
THAT
NOT
ALL
ARE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
THEY
BELONG
TO
OR
FOLLOW
GOD
IN
HIS
FOOTSTEPS
SATAN
AND
HIS
FOLLOWERS
HAVE
REBELLED
AGAINST
GOD
AND
ARE
NOT
CHILDREN
FOLLOWERSREDEEMED
OF
GOD
BUT
IT
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
ONCE
CREATED
BY
GOD
BUT
CHOSE
TO
SEPARATE
THEMSELVES
FROM
THOSE
WHO
CHOSE
TO
FOLLOW
GOD
AND
HIS
PLAN
OF
SALVATION
THE
FIELD
IS
THE
WORLD
THE
GOOD
SEED
ARE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
KINGDOM
BUT
THE
TARES
ARE
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
WICKED
ONE
MATTHEW
SO
THIS
ILLUSTRATES
NICELY
WHAT
I
JUST
SAID
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
KINGDOM
ARE
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
REMAINED
VALIANT
IN
THEIR
TESTIMONY
OF
JESUS
AND
HAVE
SHOWN
WORKS
OF
REPENTANCE
ETC
AND
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
WICKED
ONE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
REBELLED
AGAINST
GOD
AND
THE
LAMB
THE
ISSUE
OF
SATANS
SPIRITOFFSPRING
AND
THOSE
WHO
FOLLOWED
HIM
HAS
NOT
BEEN
ADDRESSED
IN
THIS
AND
OTHER
VERSES
YOU
COPIED
FROM
YOUR
BIBLE
YOU
PURPOSEFULLY
OBSCURED
THE
SUBJECT
BY
SWAMPING
YOUR
RIGHT
WITH
NON
RELATED
SCRIPTURES
LOTS
OF
NICE
SCRIPTURES
DELETED
NOT
ROBERT
W
COPYRIGHTED
THOUGH
RA
WE
ARE
TOLD
THAT
AND
THIS
IS
LIFE
ETERNAL
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
KNOW
RA
THEE
THE
ONLY
TRUE
GOD
AND
JESUS
CHRIST
WHOM
THOU
HAST
SENT
RA
JOHN
LIFE
ETERNAL
IS
TO
KNOW
THE
ONLY
TRUE
GOD
YET
THE
RA
DOCTRINES
OF
THE
LDS
THAT
I
HAVE
MENTIONED
PORTRAY
A
VASTLY
RA
DIFFERENT
JESUS
A
JESUS
THAT
CANNOT
BE
RECONCILED
WITH
THE
JESUS
OF
RA
THE
BIBLE
THEY
ARE
SO
FAR
REMOVED
FROM
EACH
OTHER
THAT
TO
PROCLAIM
CORRECTION
MY
JESUS
IS
INDEED
DIFFERENT
THAN
YOUR
JESUS
AND
CAN
BE
RECONCILED
WITH
THE
JESUS
IN
THE
BIBLE
NOT
YOUR
INTERPRETATION
OF
HIM
I
CONCUR
BUT
I
HONESTLY
COULDNT
CARE
LESS
RA
ONE
AS
BEING
TRUE
DENIES
THE
OTHER
FROM
BEING
TRUE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
RA
BIBLE
ETERNAL
LIFE
IS
DEPENDENT
ON
KNOWING
THE
ONLY
TRUE
GOD
AND
RA
NOT
THE
CONSTRUCT
OF
IMAGINATION
IN
THIS
SINGLE
POSTING
OF
YOURS
IVE
SEEN
MORE
CONSTRUCTS
OF
IMAGINATION
THAN
IN
ALL
OF
THE
PROLDS
MAILS
COMBINED
I
HAVE
READ
SO
FAR
IN
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
FIRST
GET
YOUR
LDSFACTS
STRAIGHT
BEFORE
YOU
DARE
PREACHING
TO
US
ABOUT
THE
ONLY
TRUE
GOD
WHOM
YOU
INTERPRET
ACCORDING
TO
YOUR
OWN
LIKES
AND
DISLIKES
BUT
WHOSE
IMAGE
I
CANNOT
RECONCILE
WITH
WHAT
I
KNOW
ABOUT
HIM
MYSELF
I
GUESS
YOUR
GRANDIOSE
SELFIMAGE
DOES
NOT
ALLOW
FOR
OTHER
FAITHS
BELIEVING
IN
THE
DIVINITY
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
BUT
IN
A
DIFFERENT
WAY
OR
FASHION
THAN
YOUR
OWN
NOT
THAT
IT
REALLY
MATTERS
THE
MISSION
AND
PROGRESS
OF
THE
LDS
CHURCH
WILL
GO
ON
BOLDLY
AND
NOBLY
AND
NO
MOB
OR
OPPONENT
CAN
STOP
THE
WORK
FROM
PROGRESSING
UNTIL
IT
HAS
VISITED
EVERY
CONTINENT
SWEPT
EVERY
CLIME
AND
SOUNDED
IN
EVERY
EAR
THIS
IS
REALLY
A
RED
HERRING
IT
DOESNT
ADDRESS
ANY
ISSUE
RAISED
BUT
RATHER
IT
SEEKS
TO
OBFUSCATE
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
GROUPS
TRY
TO
READ
SOMETHING
INTO
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
CHANGE
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
SIGH
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
OR
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
ACCORDING
TO
ROBERT
WEISS
AND
CO
I
RESPECT
THE
FORMER
I
REJECT
THE
LATTER
WITHOUT
THE
REMOTEST
FEELING
THAT
I
HAVE
REJECTED
JESUS
ON
THE
CONTRARY
AND
BY
THE
WAY
I
DO
RESPECT
YOUR
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
I
EVEN
GRANT
YOU
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
FOLLOWING
YOUR
OWN
IMAGE
OF
HIM
AS
MUCH
AS
I
AM
A
CHRISTIAN
FOLLOWING
MY
OWN
IMAGE
OF
HIM
IN
MY
HEART
MOST
OF
THE
OTHER
REPLIES
HAVE
INSTEAD
HOPSCOTCHED
TO
THE
ISSUE
OF
BRUCE
MCCONKIE
AND
WHETHER
HIS
VIEWS
WERE
OFFICIAL
DOCTRINE
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
IT
MATTERS
IF
MCCONKIES
VIEWS
WERE
CANON
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
ISSUE
WERE
MCCONKIES
WRITINGS
INDICATIVE
OF
MORMON
BELIEF
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
IS
THE
REAL
ISSUE
THE
INDICATION
FROM
RICK
IS
THAT
THEY
MAY
CERTAINLY
BE
THE
ISSUE
IS
OF
COURSE
THAT
YOU
LOVE
TO
USE
ANYTHING
TO
EITHER
MIS
REPRESENT
OR
RIDICULE
THE
LDS
CHURCH
THE
ISSUE
OF
OFFICIAL
DOCTRINE
IS
OBVIOUSLY
VERY
IMPORTANT
MCCONKIES
VIEWS
HAVE
BEEN
CONTROVERSIAL
EG
THE
SEVEN
DEADLY
HERESIES
HAS
MADE
ME
A
HERETIC
AT
BEST
OR
ERRONEOUS
AT
WORST
BLACKS
NOT
TO
RECEIVE
THE
PRIESTHOOD
IN
THIS
DISPENSATION
I
RESPECT
HIM
AS
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
MADE
HIS
VALUABLE
CONTRIBUTION
TO
THE
CHURCH
BUT
I
PERSONALLY
DO
NOT
RELY
ON
HIS
PERSONAL
INTERPRETATIONS
HIS
BOOK
MORMON
DOCTRINE
IS
OFTENTIMES
REFERRED
TO
AS
MCCONKIES
BIBLE
IN
MORMON
CIRCLES
ON
MORMON
DOCTRINE
I
RATHER
LOOK
TO
OFFICIAL
DOCTRINAL
SOURCES
AND
TO
HUGH
NIBLEYS
BOOKS
THE
LAST
COMMENT
IS
AN
LDSINSIDER
REFERENCE
SUMMARIZING
MCCONKIE
WAS
A
WISE
MAN
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
UNDOUBTEDLY
FAR
MORE
TO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
THAN
I
HAVE
BUT
WHOSE
VIEWS
ARE
BY
NO
MEANS
DOGMA
OR
ACCEPTED
DOCTRINE
SOME
OF
IT
CLEARLY
BELONGS
TO
PERSONAL
INTERPRETATION
AND
SPECULATION
BUT
HAVING
SAID
THIS
I
FIND
MCCONKIE
EVEN
IN
HIS
MOST
BIASED
AND
SPECULATIVE
MOMENTS
FAR
MORE
THOUGHTPROVOKING
THAN
THE
TRASH
COMING
FROM
YOUR
PROVERBIAL
PEN
IM
SOMEWHAT
APPALLED
THAT
I
HAVE
ALLOWED
MYSELF
TO
SINK
AS
LOW
AS
YOU
