THE
CONCEPT
OF
THE
FUTURE
SAVIOR
IS
ONE
OF
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
NOTIONS
OF
ZORO
ASTRIANISM
TOGETHER
WITH
THAT
OF
DUALISM
IT
APPEARS
AS
EARLY
AS
IN
THE
GATHAS
ZARATHUSHTRA
ZOROASTER
AS
THE
PROPHET
OF
THE
RELIGION
IS
HIMSELF
A
SAO
SHYANT
ONE
WHO
PERFORMS
HIS
WORKS
FOR
THE
FRASHOKERETI
THE
END
OF
THE
PRESENT
STATE
OF
THE
WORLD
WHEN
EXISTENCE
WILL
BE
REHABILITATED
AND
MADE
SPLENDID
SEE
FRASHOKERETI
LATER
ZOROASTRIAN
DOCTRINE
DEVELOPED
THIS
NOTION
INTO
A
TRUE
ESCHATOLOGICAL
MYTH
AND
EXPANDED
THE
NUMBER
OF
SAOSHYANTS
FROM
ONE
TO
THREE
ALL
THE
SAVIORS
ARE
BORN
FROM
THE
SEED
OF
ZARATHUSHTRA
WHICH
IS
PRESERVED
THROUGH
THE
AGES
IN
LAKE
KANSAOYA
IDENTIFIED
WITH
PRESENTDAY
LAKE
HELMAND
IN
SEISTAN
IRAN
PROTECTED
BY
FRAVASHIS
OR
GUARDIAN
SPIRITS
THE
GREATEST
OF
THE
AWAITED
SAOSHYANTS
THE
VICTORIOUS
ASTVATERETA
HE
WHO
EMBODIES
TRUTH
THE
SON
OF
THE
VISPATAURVAIRI
SHE
WHO
CONQUERS
ALL
IS
THE
THIRD
WHO
WILL
MAKE
EXISTENCE
SPLENDID
HE
APPEARS
IN
YASHTS
UPON
HIS
ARRIVAL
HUMANKIND
WILL
NO
LONGER
BE
SUBJECT
TO
OLD
AGE
DEATH
OR
CORRUPTION
AND
WILL
BE
GRANTED
UNLIMITED
POWER
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
DEAD
WILL
BE
RESURRECTED
AND
THE
LIVING
WILL
BE
IMMORTAL
AND
INDESTRUCTABLE
BRANDISHING
THE
WEAPON
WITH
WHICH
HE
KILLS
THE
POWERFUL
ENEMIES
OF
THE
WORLD
OF
TRUTH
THAT
IS
THE
WORLD
OF
THE
SPIRIT
AND
OF
ASHA
ASTVATERETA
WILL
LOOK
UPON
THE
WHOLE
OF
CORPOREAL
EXISTENCE
AND
RENDER
IT
IMPERISHABLE
HE
AND
HIS
COMRADES
WILL
ENGAGE
IN
A
GREAT
BATTLE
WITH
THE
FORCES
OF
EVIL
WHICH
WILL
BE
DESTROYED
THE
NAME
ASTVATERETA
IS
CLEARLY
THE
RESULT
OF
THEOLOGICAL
SPECULATION
KELLENS
AS
ARE
THOSE
OF
HIS
TWO
BROTHERS
UKHSHYATERETA
HE
WHO
MAKES
TRUTH
GROW
AND
UKHSHYATNEMAH
HE
WHO
MAKES
REVERENCE
GROW
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
THREE
VIRGINS
YASHTS
WHO
ARE
IMPREGNATED
WITH
THE
SEED
OF
ZARATHUSHTRA
WHEN
THEY
BATHE
IN
LAKE
KANSAOYA
AND
GIVE
BIRTH
TO
THE
SAOSHYANTS
ARE
EQUALLY
SPECULATIVE
EACH
OF
THESE
SAOSHYANTS
WILL
ARRIVE
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
A
MILLENNIUM
INITIATING
A
NEW
AGE
AND
A
NEW
CYCLE
OF
EXISTENCE
ASTVATERETA
WILL
APPEAR
IN
THE
THIRD
AND
FINAL
MILLENNIUM
TO
SAVE
MANKIND
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
FUTURE
SAVIOR
HAD
ALREADY
TAKEN
SHAPE
IN
THE
ARCHAEMENID
PERIOD
SIXTH
TO
FOURTH
CENTURY
BCE
IT
WAS
NOT
PERHAPS
THE
PRINCIPAL
ELEMENT
IN
THE
FORMATION
OF
THE
MESSIANIC
IDEA
BUT
IT
WAS
CERTAINLY
A
DETERMINING
FACTOR
ONE
THAT
ENJOYED
GREAT
SUCCESS
IN
THE
HELLENISTIC
PERIOD
BEYOND
THE
CONFINES
OF
THE
IRANIAN
WORLD
A
SIMILAR
CONCEPT
THAT
OF
THE
FUTURE
BUDDHA
MAITREYA
WAS
MOST
LIKELY
INDEBTED
TO
IT
AND
CHRISTIAN
MESSIANISM
CAN
TRACE
ITS
ROOTS
TO
THE
SAME
SOURCE
