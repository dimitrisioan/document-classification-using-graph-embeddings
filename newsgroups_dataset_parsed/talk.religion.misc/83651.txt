CAN
YOU

SOMETHING

CANNOT
POSSIBLY
BE
EXPLAINED
WITHOUT
ACCEPTING
AS
A
FACT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
GOD
IN
PRECISELY
THE
WAY
YOUR
HOLY
BOOK
DESCRIBES
CAN
YOU
PLEASE
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
YOUR
RELIGION
IS
MORE
THAN
A
VERY
CLEVERLYCONSTRUCTED
FABLE
AND
THAT
IT
DOES
INDEED
HAVE
SOME
BEARING
ON
MY
OWN
PERSONAL
DAYTODAY
LIFE
WOULD
YOU
CONSIDER
THE
WORD
OF
AN
EYEWITNESS
PETER
TO
TESTIFY
TO
THE
EVENTS
SURROUNDING
JESUS
LIFE
WE
DID
NOT
FOLLOW
CLEVERLY
INVENTED
STORIES
WHEN
WE
TOLD
YOU
ABOUT
THE
POWER
AND
COMING
OF
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
BUT
WE
WERE
EYEWITNESSES
OF
HIS
MAJESTY
FOR
HE
RECEIVED
HONOR
AND
GLORY
FROM
GOD
THE
FATHER
WHEN
THE
VOICE
CAME
TO
HIM
FROM
THE
MAJESTIC
GLORY
SAYING
THIS
IS
MY
SON
WHOM
I
LOVE
WITH
HIM
I
AM
WELL
PLEASED¹
WE
OURSELVES
HEARD
THIS
VOICE
THAT
CAME
FROM
HEAVEN
WHEN
WE
WERE
WITH
HIM
ON
THE
SACRED
MOUNTAIN
AND
WE
HAVE
THE
WORD
OF
THE
PROPHETS
MADE
MORE
CERTAIN
AND
YOU
WILL
DO
WELL
TO
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
IT

TO
A
