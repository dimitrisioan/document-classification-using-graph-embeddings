DAVIDIANS
AND
COMPASSION

KENT
SANDVIK
WRITES
SO
WE
HAVE
THIS
HIGHLY
CHRISTIAN
RELIGIOUS
ORDER
THAT
PUT
FIRE
ON
THEIR
HOUSE
KILLING
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
INSIDE
IM
NOT
THAT
ANNOYED
ABOUT
THE
ADULTS
THEY
KNEW
SUPPOSEDLY
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
AND
ITS
THEIR
OWN
ACTIONS
WHAT
I
MOSTLY
ARE
ANGRY
ABOUT
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
INSIDE
INCLUDING
MOTHERS
LET
THE
CHILDREN
SUFFER
AND
DIE
DURING
AWFUL
CONDITIONS
IF
THIS
IS
CONSIDERED
RELIGIOUS
FOLLOWING
TO
THE
END
IM
PROUD
THAT
I
DONT
FOLLOW
SUCH
FANATICAL
AND
NONCOMPASSIONATE
RELIGIONS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
DIE
FOR
WHATEVER
PURPOSE
BUT
PLEASE
SPARE
THE
INNOCENT
YOUNG
ONES
THAT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THIS
ALL
I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
JUST
NOW
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
KNOWS
ABOUT
THE
WORD
COMPASSION
CHRISTIANS
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
ACTIONS
TODAY
WOULD
PRODUCE
A
GOOD
PICTURE
OF
YOUR
RELIGION

KSAND
PRIVATE
ACTIVITIES
ON
THE
NET
SURELY
YOU
ARE
NOT
EQUATING
DAVID
KORESH
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
THE
TWO
ARE
NOT
COMPARABLE
