A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
DOESNT
MEAN
MUCH
UNLESS
EVERYONE
PARTICIPATES
OTHERWISE
ITS
NOT
SILENT
NOW
IS
IT
NONRELIGIOUS
REASONS
FOR
HAVING
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
FOR
A
DEAD
CLASSMATE
TO
COMFORT
THE
FRIENDS
BY
SHOWING
RESPECT
TO
THE
DECEASED
TO
GIVE
THE
CLASSMATES
A
MOMENT
TO
GRIEVE
TOGETHER
TO
GIVE
THE
FRIENDS
A
MOMENT
TO
REMEMBER
THEIR
CLASSMATE
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
SCHOOL
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CLASSMATE
IS
GONE
SO
THAT
ITS
NOT
DISRUPTIVE
LATER
YEAH
ALL
WELL
AND
GOOD
THE
FACT
IS
THOUGH
THAT
THE
PROSCHOOL
PRAYER
TYPES
HAVE
TRIED
TO
USE
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
AS
A
WAY
TO
GET
PRAYER
BACK
AT
MY
HIGH
SCHOOL
FOR
INSTANCE
OUR
DEAR
PRINCIPAL
ENDED
THE
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
WITH
AMEN
I
CAN
CERTAINLY
SEE
OPPOSING
THE
AMEN
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
REQUIRE
OPPOSING
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
I
SEE
IT
AS
THE
CAMELS
NOSE
ILL
BACK
OFF
WHEN
THEY
DO
DOES
ANYBODY
ELSE
BESIDES
ME
SEE
A
VICIOUS
CIRCLE
HERE
I
GUARANTEE
YOU
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
SCHOOL
PRAYER
ARENT
GOING
TO
BACK
OFF
WHEN
THEY
CANT
EVEN
MANAGE
TO
GET
A
QUIET
MOMENT
FOR
THEIR
KIDS
TO
PRAY
SILENTLY
IM
WILLING
TO
TAKE
MY
CHANCES
ON
WINNING
