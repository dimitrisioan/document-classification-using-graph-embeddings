RE
QUESTION
FOR
THOSE
WITH
POPULAR
MORALITY
PAUL
HUDSON
JR
HUDSONATHENACSUGAEDU
WRITES
I
WAS
NOT
DIRECTLY
GOING
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
MORAL
ARGUMENT
FOR
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
RATHER
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
SHOW
THE
ABSURDITY
OF
ATHEISTIC
MATERIALIST
RELATAVISTS
TRYING
TO
EMBRACE
SOME
COMMON
MORAL
SYSTEM
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
ABSOLUTE
MAN
KNOWS
IN
HIS
HEART
THAT
THERE
IS
RIGHT
AND
WRONG
WE
HAVE
ALL
INHERITED
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
NO
MATTER
HOW
ABSURD
IT
IS
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
A
COMMON
MORAL
SYSTEM
CREATED
BY
MANKIND
IS
ABSOLUTE
IT
IS
NOT
CONTRARY
TO
REASON
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
A
COMMON
MORAL
SYSTEM
CREATED
BY
MANKIND
IS
SENSIBLE
IN
FACT
FOR
THE
BIBLE
TO
BE
OF
ANY
USE
TO
MANKIND
AS
A
MORAL
CODE
IT
MUST
BE
INTERPRETED
BY
MANKIND
AND
A
WORKABLE
MORAL
SYSTEM
CREATED
FOR
EVERYDAY
USE
THE
JEWISH
TALMUD
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
CENTURIES
OF
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
ANALYSING
EVERY
WORD
OF
THE
TORAH
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
MORALITY
BEHIND
IT
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
WERE
GIVEN
A
VERY
STRICT
SET
OF
MORAL
CIVIL
JUDICIAL
AND
CEREMONIAL
LAWS
TO
FOLLOW
AND
YET
THIS
WAS
CLEARLY
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
COVER
EVERY
INSTANCE
OF
MORAL
DILEMMA
IN
THEIR
SOCIETY
FOR
A
CHRISTIAN
THE
SITUATION
IS
NO
BETTER
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
ONLY
CODE
OF
MORALITY
THAT
WE
HAVE
FROM
THE
JUDEO
CHRISTIAN
GOD
IS
THAT
WHICH
IS
CONTAINED
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
WE
CAN
SEE
FROM
THE
DIVERSE
OPINIONS
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
NEWSGROUPS
IS
NOT
CLEAR
THERE
MAY
WELL
BE
AN
ABSOLUTE
MORALITY
DEFINED
BY
THE
JUDEOCHRISTIAN
GOD
FOR
MANKIND
TO
FOLLOW
BUT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
WE
ONLY
HAVE
A
SUBSET
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
CONCEPT
WAS
WRITTEN
DOWN
BY
MAN
THIS
LEADS
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
DEFINING
MORALITY
FOR
OUR
SOCIETY
IF
WE
TAKE
THE
DIVINE
MORALITY
THEN
WE
HAVE
A
CODE
OF
PRACTICE
WHICH
MAY
BE
INTERPRETED
IN
MANY
DIFFERENT
WAYS
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
CONSIDER
THE
IMMOLATION
OF
HERETICS
IN
THE
FIFTEENTH
CENTURY
AND
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
ALLOWS
A
MAN
TO
DO
THAT
TO
ANOTHER
MAN
UNDER
THE
PRECEPT
TO
ADMINISTER
JUSTICE
IF
WE
TAKE
AN
AGNOSTIC
MORALITY
THEN
WE
HAVE
A
CODE
OF
PRACTICE
THAT
CAN
BE
MODIFIED
TO
SUIT
SOCIETY
WITH
ALL
THE
DANGER
THAT
THIS
IMPLIES
ALTERNATIVELY
WE
COULD
TAKE
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
JUDEOCHRISTIAN
MORALITY
AND
INTERPRETEXTEND
THIS
TO
CREATE
AND
JUSTIFY
A
CODE
OF
MORALITY
WHICH
SUITS
THE
SOCIETY
WE
LIVE
IN
AND
ENABLES
THE
PEOPLE
TO
LIVE
RIGHTEOUSLY
AS
MANY
CHRISTIAN
AND
NONCHRISTIAN
PHILOSOPHERS
HAVE
DONE
WHATEVER
THE
DRIVING
FORCE
BEHIND
THE
DEFINITION
OF
MORALITY
FOR
OUR
SOCIETY
I
THINK
THE
IMPORTANT
ASPECT
IS
THE
RESULT
DAVID
ON
RELIGION
OH
WHERE
IS
THE
SEA
THE
FISHES
CRIED
AS
THEY
SWAM
ITS
CLEARNESS
THROUGH
