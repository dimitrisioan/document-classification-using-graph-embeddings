so
we
have
this
highly
christian
religious
order
that
put
fire
on
their
house
killing
most
of
the
people
inside
we
have
no
way
to
know
that
the
cultists
burned
the
house
it
could
have
been
the
batf
and
fbi
we
only
have
the
governments
word
for
it
after
all
and
people
who
started
it
by
a
noknock
search
with
concussion
grenades
are
hardly
disinterested
observers
well
looking
at
the
videos
it
seems
that
this
fire
started
in
various
places
at
the
same
time
which
would
indicate
that
this
was
a
planned
action
im
sure
fbi
and
batf
didnt
deliberately
start
a
possible
fire
having
a
sniper
kill
korresh
would
have
been
a
far
easier
method
looking
at
the
careful
operation
and
use
of
tear
gas
that
as
i
know
dont
start
fires
it
is
less
likely
that
this
was
the
case
sorry
but
my
bets
are
on
fanatical
people
keen
to
start
armageddon
theirs
