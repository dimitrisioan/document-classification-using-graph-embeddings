RE
NEW
BIBLICAL
CONTRADICTIONS
STILL
NOT
ANSWERED
JUDAS
MR
DECENSO
IN
SPITE
OF
REQUIRING
SCHOLARLY
OPINION
ON
THE
HANGING
OF
JUDAS
REJECTS
THAT
THE
SCHOLARLY
OPINION
OF
THE
THOSE
SCHOLARS
AND
THEN
REPHRASES
THOSE
SCHOLARS
OPINION
ON
THE
SUBJECT
WE
DO
KNOW
FROM
MATTHEW
THAT
HE
DID
HANG
HIMSELF
AND
ACTS
PROBABLY
RECORDS
HIS
DEATH
ALTHOUGH
ITS
POSSIBLE
AND
PLAUSIBLE
THAT
HE
FELL
FROM
THE
HANGING
AND
HIT
SOME
ROCKS
THEREBY
BURSTING
OPEN
I
CAN
NO
LONGER
ASSUME
THAT
TO
BE
THE
CASE
THEREFORE
NO
CONTRADICTION
MATTHEW
DID
NOT
SAY
JUDAS
DIED
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
HANGING
DID
HE
MOST
SCHOLARS
BELIEVE
HE
IPROBABLY
DID
BUT
I
QUOTED
ALL
THAT
TO
SHOW
THAT
I
HIGHLY
REGARD
THE
SCHOLARS
EXPLANATIONS
BUT
IN
LOOKING
AT
THE
TEXTS
INITIALLY
WE
CANT
ASSUME
JUDAS
DIED
IT
IS
HOWEVER
HIGHLY
PROBABLE
AND
ALSO
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
THE
GREEK
TO
SUGGEST
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
IT
SIMPLY
MEANS
HANG
ONESELF
ACTUALLY
IF
YOU
DO
FURTHER
RESEARCH
AS
TO
THE
GREEK
WORD
APACGW
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
IT
DOES
DENOTE
SUCCESS
THOSE
SCHOLARS
DID
INDEED
HAVE
AN
EXCELLENT
REASON
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THE
SUICIDE
WAS
SUCCESSFUL
AS
I
POINTED
OUT
I
RECENTLY
CHECKED

WERE

THAT
APACGW
MEANS
SPECIFICALLY
KILL
YOURSELF
BY
HANGING
A
COUPLE
ALSO
NOTED
THAT
THE
MEANING
OF
ONE
THE
ROOT
WORDS
FOR
APACGW
IS
STRANGLE
THROTTLE
OR
CHOKE
WHICH
PRETTY
MUCH
INVALIDATES
THE
GUY
WHO
SUGGESTED
TO
DAVID
JOSLIN
THAT
JUDAS
WAS
HUNG
UPSIDE
DOWN
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
REFERENCES
THOUGH
ROBINSONS
GREEK
AND
ENGLISH
LEXICON
OF

NOT

STATED
THE
TRANSLATION
IT
GAVE
BOTH
THE
ROOT
WORDS
THE
LITERAL
TRANSLATION

GREEK
WORDS
WHICH
USE
THE
SAME
ROOTS
AND
ALSO
OTHER
PRESENTED
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
OF
THE
WORD
IN
GREEK
LITERATURE
TO
GIVE
FURTHER
CONTEXT
THE
WORD
APAGCHW
HAS
TWO
ROOT
WORDS
GCHW
IS
THE
TO
STRANGLE
ROOT
AND
THE
ROOT
WORD
APO
MEANS
LITERALLY
AWAY
THIS
ROOT
WORDS
IS
INCLUDED
IN
WORDS
WHICH
DENOTE
A
TRANSITION
IT
CAN
MEAN
A
TRANSITION
IN
PLACE
EG
THE
GREEK
WORD
APAGELLO
MEANS
TO
SEND
A
MESSAGE
APO
CAN
ALSO
DENOTE
A
CHANGE
IN
STATE
AND
SPECIFICALLY
THE
CHANGE
FROM
LIFE
TO
DEATH
ROBINSON
SPECIFICALLY
MAKES
COMPARISON
TO
THE
WORD
APOKTEIUO
WHICH
MEANS
TO
KILL
IN
LITERAL
MEANING
THE
WORD
APACGW
MEANS
TO
THROTTLE
STRANGLE
TO
PUT
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
AND
IMPLICITLY
DENOTES
A
CHANGE
IN
LIFE
STATE
IE
AWAY
FROM
LIFE
TO
DEATH
SO
WHILE
THE
WORD
APACGW
DOES
MEAN
TO
HANG
IT
SPECIFICALLY
DENOTES
A
DEATH
AS
WELL
THUS
ROBINSON
IS
QUITE
SPECIFIC
WHEN
HE
STATE
THAT
IT
MEANS
TO
HANG
ONESELF
TO
END
ONES
LIFE
BY
HANGING
HE
THEN
NOTES
THE
THE
USE
OF
APACGW
IN
HOMERS
ODESSY
TO
DENOTE
CONTEXT
HE
PRESENTS
THAT
EXAMPLE
OF
APACGW
AS
BEING
USED
TO
EXPLICITLY
MEAN
SUICIDE
BY
HANGING
NOW
SINCE
THERE
IS
A
PERFECTLY
GOOD
WORD
FOR
STRANGLING
WITHOUT
THE
ADDED
DENOTATION
OF
DEATH
AND
AS
YOU
INSIST
THAT
THE
BIBLE
WAS
WRITTEN
BY
GOD
AND
EVERY
WORD
IS
PRECICELY
CORRECT
YOU
ARE
STUCK
WITH
THE
COMPLETE
MEANING
OF
APACGW
IE
SINCE
THE
WORD
APACGW
WAS
USED
THEN
DEATH
IS
DENOTED
AS
THE
RESULT
BY
THE
WAY
I
NOTE
THAT
MR
DECENSO
ALSO
PRESENTS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
APACGW
IN
THE
SEPTUAGINT
THE
GREEK
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
OT
USED
AT
THE
TIME
OF
JESUS
ITS
ONLY
USED
IN
SAMUEL
NOW
WHEN
AHITHOPHEL
SAW
THAT
HIS
ADVICE
WAS
NOT
FOLLOWED
HE
SADDLED
A
DONKEY
AND
AROSE
AND
WENT
HOME
TO
HIS
HOUSE
TO
HIS
CITY
THEN
HE
PUT
HIS
HOUSEHOLD
IN
ORDER
AND
HANGED
HIMSELF
AND
DIED
AND
HE
WAS
BURIED
IN
HIS
FATHERS
TOMB
NOTICE
THAT
NOT
ONLY
IS
IT
STATED
THAT
AHITHOPHEL
HANGED
HIMSELF
GR
SEPT
APAGCHO
BUT
IT
EXPLICITLY
ADDS
AND
DIED
HERE
WE
HAVE
NO
DOUBT
OF
THE
RESULT
IN
MATTHEW
WE
ARE
NOT
EXPLICITLY
TOLD
JUDAS
DIED
NOTE
MR
DECENSO
AS
YOU
SAY
THE
SEPTUAGINT
WAS
A
TRANSLATION
FROM
HEBREW
TO
GREEK
AND
YOU
HAVE
NOT
SHOWN
THE
ORIGINAL
MEANING
OF
THE
HEBREW
IE
THE
THE
HEBREW
SAY
AND
DIED
AND
THUS
WHETHER
IT
WAS
SIMPLY
ECHOED
IN
THE
GREEK
IT
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
ADDED
AND
DIED
THE
CORRECT
TRANSLATION
WOULD
STILL
BE
APACGW
AS
THE
MAN
DID
INDEED
DIE
FROM
STRANGULATION
REDUNDANT
BUT
CORRECT
FURTHER
WE
HAVE
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
SEPTUAGINT
WAS
REPEATEDLY
REWRITTEN
AND
REEDITED
WHICH
INCLUDED
VERSIONS
WHICH
CONTRADICTED
EACH
OTHER
AND
SUCH
EDITING
WAS
NOT
EVEN
NECESSARILY
EXECUTED
BY
GREEKS
THUS
I
AM
NOT
SURE
THAT
YOU
CAN
USE
THE
SEPTUAGINT
AS
IT
NOW
STANDS
AS
A
PARAGON
OF
ANCIENT
GREEK
SO
WHAT
YOU
REALLY
NEED
TO
PROVE
YOUR
POINT
MR
DECENSO
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
IN
ANCIENT
GREEK
OF
SOMEONE
COMMITTING
APACGW
AND
SURVIVING
OTHERWISE
I
WOULD
SEE
YOU
AS
SIMPLY
MAKING
WORTHLESS
ASSERTIONS
WITHOUT
CORRESPONDING
EVIDENCE
NOW
I
WOULD
NOTE
MR
DECENSO
THAT
EVERYTIME
I
GO
OUT
OF
MY
WAY
TO
RESEARCH
IT
ONE
OF
YOUR
APPARENTLY
CONTRIVED
EXEGISIS
I
PRETTY
MUCH
FIND
IT
FALSE
THUS
I
THINK
THAT
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
ADD
TO
THE
TEXT
SOMETHING
OVER
AND
ABOVE
WHAT
THE
SOURCE
CLEARLY
SAYS
THEN
YOU
HAD
BETTER
HAVE
AN
EXPLICIT
GREEK
OR
HISTORICAL
SOURCE
TO
JUSTIFY
IT
BY
THE
WAY
AS
TO
MR
ROSES
STATEMENT
ABOUT
TREES
AROUND
THE
POTTERS
FIELD
THERE
ARE
STILL
TREES
AROUND
THE
LEDGES
AND
A
ROCKY
PAVEMENT
AT
THE
BOTTOM
UNLESS
MR
ROSE
CAN
SHOW
THAT
THESE
TREES
ARE
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
OLD
OR
THAT
THERE
ARE
YEAR
OLD
STUMPS
THERE
OR
HAS
A
THOUSAND
YEAR
OLD
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
AREA
WHICH
MENTIONS
SUCH
TREES
THEN
IT
IS
INAPPROPRIATE
FOR
HIM
TO
ASSERT
THAT
THE
PRESENT
PLACEMENT
OF
TREES
PROVE
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
TREES
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
AGO
AFTER
ALL
THINGS
CHANGE
NOW
AS
TO
YOUR
OTHER
ARGUMENT
IE
THAT
THE
MONEY
JUDAS
USED
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
SILVERS
AS
TO
YOUR
SECOND
QUESTION
MR
DECENSO
YOU
ASK
HOW
WE
COULD
BE
SURE
THAT
THE
MONEY
WITH
WHICH
JUDAS
PURCHASED
THE
LAND
WAS
INDEED
FOR
THE
BETRAYAL
RATHER
THAN
SOME
OTHER
SOURCE
I
WOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
IN
ACTS
WHERE
IT
SPECIFICALLY
MENTION
THE
REWARD
OF
INIQUITY
ACTS
IT
ALSO
SPECIFICALLY
MENTIONS
WHAT
ACT
OF
INIQUITY
THEY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
IE
ACTS
CONCERNING
JUDAS
WHO
WAS
GUIDE
TO
THOSE
WHO
ARRESTED
JESUS
NOW
I
WOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
WHEN
THE
BIBLE
DESCRIBES
AN
ACT
OF
INIQUITY
AND
THEN
IMMEDIATELY
DISCUSSES
THE
REWARD
OF
INIQUITY
IT
WOULD
BE
RATHER
INANE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
IT
WAS
AN
ACTION
OF
INIQUITY
OTHER
THAN
THE
ONE
DISCUSSED
NOTICE
THAT
IN
VERSE
THE
WORD
INIQUITY
IS
NOT
USED
RATHER
IT
STATES
THAT
JUDAS
BECAME
A
GUIDE
TO
THOSE
WHO
ARRESTED
JESUS
BUT
THE
WRITER
DID
NOT
STOP
THEREVS
FOR
HE
WAS
NUMBERED
WITH
US
AND
OBTAINED
A
PART
IN
THIS
MINISTRY
WHAT
PART
DID
JUDAS
PLAY
IN
THEIR
MINISTRY
TRUE
PETER
OR
THE
AUTHOR
OF
ACTS
DOES
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
CALL
JUDAS
BETRAYAL
AN
INIQUITY
BUT
FOR
THAT
MATTER
NEITHER
DOES
JOHN
SPECIFICALLY
CALL
JUDAS
ACTIONS
AN
INIQUITY
EITHER
FURTHER
JOHN
DID
NOT
SAY
THAT
JUDAS
TOOK
THE
MONEY
BOX
BUT
RATHER
SAID
SOME
THOUGHT
THAT
BECAUSE
JUDAS
HAD
THE
MONEY
BOX
JESUS
WAS
TELLING
HIM
BUY
WHAT
WE
NEED
FOR
THE
FEAST
OR
THAT
HE
SHOULD
GIVE
SOMETHING
TO
THE
POOR
SO
AFTER
RECEIVING
THE
MORSEL
HE
IMMEDIATELY
WENT
OUT
AND
IT
WAS
NIGHT
NOTE
THAT
IT
IS
SAID
THAT
JUDAS
LEFT
IT
DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
HE
TOOK
THE
MONEY
BOX
THUS
WHEN
I
SEE
YOUR
EXPLANATION
IT
STILL
SEEMS
TO
ME
YOU
WOULD
CHOOSE
THE
A
AN
UNPROVEN
INIQUITY
MENTIONED
BY
ANOTHER
AUTHOR
IN
A
DIFFERENT
BOOK
WRITTEN
AT
A
DIFFERENT
TIME
OVER
THE
INIQUITY
EXPLICITLY
MENTIONED
BY
THE
AUTHOR
OF
ACTS
I
FIND
THIS
FORCED
AND
CONTRIVED
OF
COURSE
THIS
PARTICULAR
ARGUMENT
BECOMES
MOOT
SINCE
WE
HAVE
HAVE
SEEN
EVIDENCE
THAT
APACGW
MEANS
SUICIDE
YOU
SEE
SINCE
JUDAS
HANGING
WAS
SUCCESSFUL
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
SPENT
THE
MONEY
MENTIONED
IN
JOHN
BECAUSE
MATTHEW
AND
MARK
EXPLICITLY
SAY
THE
BETRAYAL
WAS
ON
THE
HIGH
HOLY
DAY
IE
PASSOVER
AND
THUS
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
SPENT
THE
MONEY
BEFORE
KILLING
HIMSELF
THE
NEXT
DAY
THUS
THE
MONEY
WHICH
BOUGHT
THE
FIELD
OF
BLOOD
WOULD
HAVE
TO
HAVE
BEEN
THE
PIECES
OF
SILVER
OF
COURSE
HE
GOT
THE
PIECES
OF
SILVER
THAT
NIGHT
AS
WELL
AND
THUS
COULDNT
HAVE
SPENT
THAT
EITHER
OH
DEAR
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
HOUSE
OF
CARDS
IS
COMMING
DOWN
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
AT
THIS
POINT
DISCUSS
NOW
WHETHER
JESUS
WAS
CRUCIFIED
ON
FRIDAY
OR
SATURDAY
AS
THAT
IS
NOW
PART
OF
THE
ARGUMENT
ABOUT
JUDAS
BY
THE
WAY
AS
TO
WHERE
THE
PROPHESY
OF
THE
POTTERS
FIELD
CAME
FROM
IE
THE
MENTION
OF
IT
IN
MATTHEW
YOU
SAY
PLEASE
WHEN
WE
ARE
DONE
WITH
THIS
STUDY
ON
HIS
DEATH
REMIND
ME
TO
DISCUSS
THIS
WITH
YOU
I
AM
REMINDING
YOU
NOW
TO
DISCUSS
IT
NOW
ITS
ALL
PART
OF
THE
SAME
VERSE
WE
ARE
DISCUSSING
AND
I
WISH
YOU
WOULD
QUIT
PROCRASTINATING
AND
SIDESTEPPING
THESE
ISSUES
LATER
DAVE
BUTLER
A
WISE
MAN
PROPORTIONS
HIS
BELIEF
TO
THE
EVIDENCE
DAVID
HUME
PHILOSOPHER
AN
INQUIRY
CONCERNING
HUMAN
UNDERSTANDING
PS
I
WOULD
NOTE
AGAIN
THAT
YOU
ARE
NOT
STATING
THAT
THAT
BIBLE
IS
NOT
POSSIBLY
INERRANT
YOU
ARE
STATING
THAT
IT
IS
INERRANT
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
BY
YOUR
OWN
ADMISSION
PRESENTING
MERELY
POSSIBLE
RECONCILIATIONS
I
OF
COURSE
DONT
RATE
THEM
THAT
HIGHLY
THEN
THE
BEST
YOU
CAN
DO
IS
SAY
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
POSSIBLY
INERRANT
NOT
THAT
IT
IS
INERRANT
