IT
SHOULD
BE
REMEMBERED
THAT
ALL
OF
THE
FIRST
REPORTS
CAME
FROM
THE
FBI
AND
THAT
INDEPENDENT
OBSERVERS
IE
THE
PRESS
WERE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
GET
CLOSE
AND
SEE
THINGS
FOR
THEMSELVES
OFFICIAL
COMMUNIQUES
TEND
TO
BE
SELFSERVING
FOR
THE
AGENCIES
THAT

PEOPLE
IN
GENERAL
TEND
TO
BELIEVE
FIRST
REPORTS
AS
THESE
GET

THE
BIGGEST
HEADLINES
CORRECTIONS
ARE
OFTEN
OVERLOOKED
AN
EXAMPLE
IS
THE
FBI
REPORT
THAT
SEVERAL
OF
THE
BODIES
FOUND
IN
THE
RUBBLE
HAD
BULLET
WOUNDS
THE
LOCAL
CORONER
WHO

FOUND
NO
