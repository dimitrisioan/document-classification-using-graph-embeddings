and
does
it
not
say
in
scripture
that
no
man
knows
the
hour
of
his
coming
not
even
the
angels
in
heaven
but
only
the
father
himself
dk
was
trying
to
play
god
by
breaking
the
seals
himself
dk
killed
himself
and
as
many
of
his
followers
as
he
could
btw
god
did
save
the
children
they
are
in
heaven
a
far
better
place
how
do
i
know
by
faith
it
seems
faith
is
the
only
tool
available
for
emotional
purposes
due
to
the
tragedy
as
such
it
maybe
fills
a
need
however
im
getting
tired
to
see
children
dying
in
pain
in
sudan
due
to
lack
of
food
and
assuming
that
god
takes
these
sufferers
to
heaven
after
a
painful
death
if
the
children
are
not
being
fed
whose
fault
is
that
you
and
i
have
plenty
of
food
on
our
tables
while
others
starve
why
is
that
god
gave
us
this
earth
to
manage
i
dont
think
were
doing
a
very
good
job
of
it
the
only
consolation
i
have
for
those
suffering
children
is
that
they
will
be
received
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
where
they
will
never
thirst
and
never
hunger
again
peace
be
with
you
