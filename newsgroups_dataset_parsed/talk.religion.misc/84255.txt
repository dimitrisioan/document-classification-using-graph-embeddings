for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
i
assume
you
have
evidence
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
only
my
common
sense
the
fire
was
caused
by
either
koresh
and
his
followers
or
by
the
fbiatfciakgband
maybe
the
harper
valley
pta
since
you
are
throwing
around
the
evidence
arguement
ill
throw
it
back
can
you
prove
any
government
agency
did
it
please
dont
resort
to
they
covered
it
up
so
that
proves
they
did
it
or
any
wild
theories
about
how
the
government
agencies
intentionally
started
the
fire
the
key
words
are
proof
and
evidence
proves
they
did
it
all
that
thou
shalt
not
kill
stuff
id
like
to
point
out
that
the
bible
says
do
not
commit
murder
the
nkj
translation
mistranslates
selfdefense
was
never
considered
murder
the
please
explain
how
koresh
was
defending
himself
from
those
children
who
burned
