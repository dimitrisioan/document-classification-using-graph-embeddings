WRITES
WHY
DONT
WE
JUST
STICK
TO
THE
POSITIVE
AND
FIND
WAYS
TO
BRING
PEOPLE
TO
JESUS
ISTEAD
OF
TAKING
BULLWHIPS
AND
DRIVING
THEM
AWAY
CERTAINLY
WE
SHOULD
NOT
USE
A
BULLWHIP
TO
DRIVE
PEOPLE
FROM
JESUS
BUT
WE
SHOULDNT
WATER
DOWN
THE
GOSPEL
TO
DRAW
PEOPLE
IN
VERY
WELL
PUT
AND
IN
THE
CASE
OF
SOMEONE
WHO
CALLS
HIMSELF
A
CHRISTIAN
BROTHER
YET
CONTINUES
IN
HIS
SIN
AND
CLAIMS
THAT
HIS
SIN
IS
NOT
A
SIN
AT
ALL
BUT
PERFECTLY
ACCEPTABLE
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
DONE
SHOULD
CHRISTIANS
JUST
IGNORE
A
SINFUL
LIFESTYLE
IN
ORDER
TO
NOT
OFFEND
THE
PERSON
BY
REAFFIRMING
THAT
THE
LIFESTYLE
IS
SINFUL
ACCORDING
TO
THE
BIBLE
ARE
THEY
USING
A
BULLWHIP
TO
DRIVE
PEOPLE
FROM
JESUS
FRANKLY
I
FIND
THE
OCCURANCE
OF
A
HOMOSEXUAL
CHRISTIAN
ATTEMPTING
TO
PASS
HIMSELF
OFF
AS
A
STRAIGHT
CHRISTIAN
IN
ORDER
TO
HAVE
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
ACCEPT
HIS
CHASTISEMENT
BETTER
A
LOT
MORE
SERIOUS
THAN
PEOPLE
REAFFIRMING
THAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
A
SIN
