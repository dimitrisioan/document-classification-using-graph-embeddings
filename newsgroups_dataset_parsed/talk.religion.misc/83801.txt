why
dont
we
just
stick
to
the
positive
and
find
ways
to
bring
people
to
jesus
istead
of
taking
bullwhips
and
driving
them
away
certainly
we
should
not
use
a
bullwhip
to
drive
people
from
jesus
but
we
shouldnt
water
down
the
gospel
to
draw
people
in
very
well
put
and
in
the
case
of
someone
who
calls
himself
a
christian
brother
yet
continues
in
his
sin
and
claims
that
his
sin
is
not
a
sin
at
all
but
perfectly
acceptable
what
should
be
done
should
christians
just
ignore
a
sinful
lifestyle
in
order
to
not
offend
the
person
by
reaffirming
that
the
lifestyle
is
sinful
according
to
the
bible
are
they
using
a
bullwhip
to
drive
people
from
jesus
frankly
i
find
the
occurance
of
a
homosexual
christian
attempting
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
straight
christian
in
order
to
have
other
christians
accept
his
chastisement
better
a
lot
more
serious
than
people
reaffirming
that
the
bible
teaches
homosexuality
is
a
sin
