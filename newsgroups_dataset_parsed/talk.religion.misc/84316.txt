IF
YOU
SAY
X
STATEMENT
AND
GIVE
IT
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
FACT
I
WILL
RESPOND
BY
ASKING
YOU
WHY
YOU
ARENT
OBLIGATED
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
BUT
IF
YOUR
INTENT
IS
TO
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
X
STATEMENT
IS
TRUE
THEN
YES
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IS
UPON
YOU
SOME
INTERESTING
STUFF
ON
THE
LINES
OF
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
BELONGS
TO
GOD
IF
YOU
ARE
MERELY
GIVING
TESTIMONY
TO
YOUR
BELIEFS
THEN
YOU
ARE
AN
EGOTIST
PLEASE
EXCUSE
ME
IF
I
MISSED
AN
EARLIER
PART
OF
THIS
THREAD
IN
WHICH
BILL
CAME
ACROSS
LIKE
AN
EGOTIST
WHAT
I
SAW
WAS
SIMPLY
OBEDIENCE
TO
THE
SCRIPTURAL
COMMAND
TO
ALWAYS
BE
READY
TO
GIVE
A
REASON
FOR
THE
JOY
THAT
IS
IN
YOU
THE
REMAINDER
OF
MY
ARTICLE
DELETED
STATED
WHY
ONE
WOULD
BE
AN
EGOTIST
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
SOMEONE
CARED
ABOUT
WHAT
BILL
R
THOUGHT
HE
NEEDED
TO
SAY
ABOUT
GOD
WHETHER
THEY
DID
OR
NOT
IS
IRRELEVANT
JUMPING
ON
YOUR
TRAILER
ALWAYS
BE
READY
ETC
THEN
THAT
GOES
RIGHT
BACK
TO
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
QUESTION
GO
AHEAD
AND
GIVE
ME
A
REASON
WHY
YOU
THINK
GOD
EXISTS
IF
YOU
STATE
SUCH
A
THING
