even
though
a
newborn
is
innocent
as
can
be
his
sinful
nature
will
surely
manifest
itself
more
explicity
as
he
gets
older
for
as
surely
as
he
grows
hair
on
his
head
and
teeth
within
his
mouth
he
will
show
the
signs
of
his
innate
sin
by
rebelling
against
mommy
and
daddy
with
that
loud
proclamation
no
thats
not
showing
the
signs
of
his
innate
sin
thats
testing
the
limits
of
his
newfound
independence
a
twoyearold
will
continually
test
you
to
see
just
how
much
he
can
get
away
with
just
as
a
pet
dog
will
if
a
child
always
submitted
to
your
will
in
a
docile
fashion
would
you
praise
him
and
suspect
that
hes
the
second
coming
of
christ
or
would
you
seek
professional
help
about
his
emotional
development
