THESE
LAWS
WRITTEN
FOR
THE
ISRAELITES
GODS
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
WHOM
GOD
HAD
EXPRESSLY
SET
APART
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
THE
ISRAELITES
WERE
A
DIRECT
WITNESS
TO
GODS
EXISTENCE
TO
DISOBEY
GOD
AFTER
KNOWING
THAT
GOD
IS
REAL
WOULD
BE
AN
OUTRIGHT
DENIAL
OF
GOD
AND
THEREFORE
IMMEDIATELY
PUNISHABLE
REMEMBER
THESE
LAWS
WERE
WRITTEN
FOR
A
DIFFERENT
TIME
AND
APPLIED
ONLY
TO
GODS
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
BUT
JESUS
HAS
CHANGED
ALL
OF
THAT
WE
ARE
LIVING
IN
THE
AGE
OF
GRACE
SIN
IS
NO
LONGER
IMMEDIATELY
PUNISHABLE
BY
DEATH
THERE
IS
REPENTANCE
AND
THERE
IS
SALVATION
THROUGH
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
NOT
JUST
FOR
A
FEW
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
SALVATION
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
EVERYONE
JEW
AND
GENTILE
ALIKE
SORRY
IF
THIS
IS
LATE
FOR
THE
THREAD
BUT
I
THOUGHT
GOD
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
CONSTANT
AND
NEVERCHANGING
HOW
DO
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
COMMON
CHRISTIAN
VIEW
WITH
THE
PARAGRAPH
ABOVE
GOD
NEVER
CHANGES
SORRY
BUT
YES
HE
DOES
BY
YOUR
OWN
DESCRIPTION
HE
STILL
LOVES
US
SENDING
JESUS
WAS
ONE
OF
HIS
ATTEMPTS
TO
RECONCILE
WITH
MANKIND
HUMOROUS
THIS
NOTION
OF
AN
ALLKNOWING
ALLPOWERFUL
GOD
WHO
MUST
ATTEMPT
TO
RECONCILE
WITH
HIS
LOWLY
CREATIONS
I
REALIZE
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
PENETRATE
SUCH
LOGIC
BUT
IS
THERE
ANY
CHANCE
THAT
YOU
MIGHT
CONSIDER
THAT
AN
OMNIPOTENT
GOD
NEED
NOT
ATTEMPT
ANYTHING
AND
FURTHER
THAT
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
RECONCILE
IMPLIES
A
LACK
OF
OMNISCIENCE
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
HERE
IS
PROJECTING
HUMAN
WEAKNESSES
ONTO
YOUR
GOD
ALSO
WHILE
WERE
AT
IT
HOW
DO
YOU
RECONCILE
A
KIND
AND
LOVING
GOD
WITH
THE
JUDEOCHRISTIAN
VIEW
THAT
SIN
WAS
AT
ONE
TIME
IMMEDIATELY
PUNISHABLE
BY
DEATH
WAS
KILLING
PEOPLE
FOR
SINNING
GODS
WAY
OF
SHOWING
KINDNESS
AND
LOVE
SINNING
IN
THE
FACE
OF
GOD
WAS
PUNISHABLE
BY
IMMEDIATE
DEATH
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
OT
PASSAGES
TO
BACK
THIS
UP
GOD
IS
GOD
BUT
ALL
HUMANS
ARE
SINNERS
THUS
ALL
PREJESUS
HUMANS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PUNISHED
WITH
DEATH
WE
ARENT
PUNISHED
WITH
SIN
NOW
OF
COURSE
BECAUSE
GOD
HAS
CHANGED
HE
REQUIRED
A
BRUTAL
SADISTIC
SACRIFICE
OF
HIS
OWN
BLOOD
IN
ORDER
TO
ALLOW
US
TO
SIN
WITHOUT
IMMEDIATE
DEATH
HE
CANNOT
TOLERATE
THE
PRESCENCE
OF
SIN
IN
HIS
MIDST
YET
HE
DOES
SO
NOW
HE
HAS
CHANGED
THE
SADISTIC
MURDER
OF
HIS
OWN
SON
HAS
MADE
HIM
MORE
TOLERANT
OF
OUR
SINS
BESIDES
HIS
MIDST
IS
EVERYWHERE
SO
YOUR
STATEMENT
IS
MEANINGLESS
HE
TOLERATES
SIN
IN
HELL
WHICH
SURELY
IS
IN
HIS
MIDST
AS
WELL
ALSO
GIVEN
THAT
HE
IS
ALLKNOWING
HE
MUST
HAVE
ETERNAL
KNOWLEDGE
OF
WHO
WILL
COMMIT
WHICH
SINS
AS
WELL
AS
WHEN
AND
WHERE
SO
WHAT
DOES
TOLERANCE
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
ANYTHING
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
ABSOLUTE
NONSENSE
UNLESS
YOUR
GOD
IS
NOT
INDEED
ALLKNOWING
AND
ALLPOWERFUL
OR
UNLESS
HE
DOESNT
TAKE
THE
PERSONAL
INTEREST
IN
EVERYDAY
AFFAIRS
THAT
YOU
CLAIM
AND
THE
ISRAELITES
KNEW
THIS
AND
STILL
SOME
OF
THEM
CHOSE
TO
DISOBEY
AND
WERE
DESTROYED
WERE
THESE
PEOPLE
KIND
AND
LOVING
THEMSELVES
NOT
RELEVANT
THE
CLAIM
OF
KINDNESS
AND
LOVINGNESS
WAS
MADE
BY
YOU
IN
REFERENCE
TO
YOUR
GOD
THE
NATURE
OF
HIS
CREATIONSVICTIMS
IS
NOT
AT
ISSUE
GOD
GAVE
THEM
EVERY
BREAK
HE
COULD
BUT
IN
THE
END
HE
REALLY
HAD
NO
CHOICE
IN
THE
MATTER
I
SEE
AN
ALLKNOWING
GOD
WHO
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ULTIMATE
OUTCOME
WOULD
BE
AND
AN
ALLPOWERFUL
GOD
WHO
HAD
NO
CHOICE
IN
THE
MATTER
MINDMUSH
SEEING
AS
HOW
WE
WERE
FAILING
TO
ACHIEVE
SALVATION
ON
OUR
OWN
HE
SENT
HIS
SON
TO
DIE
FOR
US
TO
BE
THE
ULTIMATE
SIN
OFFERING
DID
I
MISS
SOMETHING
DID
YOU
GIVE
SOME
INDICATION
AT
TO
WHY
A
KIND
AND
LOVING
GOD
SHOULD
REQUIRE
SADISTIC
HUMAN
SACRIFICE
TO
ALLOW
HIS
OWN
BOTCHED
CREATIONS
TO
ACHIEVE
SALVATION
IS
THE
FACT
THE
HE
NO
LONGER
DOES
THIS
AN
ADMISSION
ON
HIS
PART
OF
HAVING
MADE
A
MISTAKE
HE
SENT
HIS
SON
AS
A
CONSOLATION
TO
US
OUT
OF
LOVE
I
NOTE
THAT
YOUR
ANSWER
PHYSICALLY
FOLLOWS
MY
QUESTION
BUT
I
FAIL
TO
DISCERN
A
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
BY
THE
WAY
FOR
WHAT
AM
I
BEING
CONSOLED
NOW
THAT
WE
ARE
LIVING
IN
THE
AGE
OF
GRACE
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
FOR
OUR
SINS
GOD
NOW
DAMNS
US
TO
ETERNAL
HELL
AFTER
WE
DIE
RATHER
THAN
KILLING
US
IMMEDIATELY
IF
SO
IS
THIS
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
KIND
AND
LOVING
GOD
HEY
LETS
BE
FAIR
FOR
A
MOMENT
HERE
KIND
AND
LOVING
DOES
NOT
MEAN
A
FREE
RIDE
WHY
NOT
BY
THE
WAY
I
NOTE
FOR
THE
RECORD
THAT
YOU
DIDNT
ANSWER
THE
QUESTIONS
THERE
IS
AN
AMOUNT
OF
GIVE
AND
TAKE
AS
IN
ANY
RELATIONSHIP
PARENTS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
KIND
AND
LOVING
BUT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
CHILDREN
CAN
DO
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
NOT
PART
OF
BEING
A
PARENT
MEANS
ADMINISTERING
PUNISHMENT
WHEN
THE
CHILD
IS
AT
FAULT
DEATH
ANDOR
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
IS
YOUR
IDEA
OF
CORRECTIONAL
PUNISHMENT
I
HOPE
YOU
ARENT
A
PARENT
PART
OF
BEING
A
PARENT
MEANS
GIVING
INSTRUCTION
GOD
TESTS
US
THROUGH
THE
TRIAL
OF
LIFE
SUCH
THAT
WE
MAY
GROW
STRONGER
HE
TEACHES
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
AND
WHAT
IS
WRONG
THIS
IS
QUITE
AN
ELABORATE
FANTASY
THAT
YOUVE
CONSTRUCTED
BUT
SADLY
IT
LACKS
A
BASIS
IN
REALITY
IT
ALSO
DOES
NOT
ADDRESS
THE
QUESTIONS
THAT
I
RAISED
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
OUR
ACTIONS
ARE
MADE
CLEAR
TO
US
BE
IT
HEAVEN
OR
BE
IT
HELL
IF
GOD
DID
NOT
FOLLOW
THROUGH
WITH
WHAT
HE
HAS
WARNED
US
ABOUT
HE
WOULD
NOT
BE
A
VERY
GOOD
PARENT
THE
GOD
THAT
YOU
DESCRIBE
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
PARENT
BUT
A
TYRANT
IN
PARENTING
IF
A
PARENT
ISSUES
A
WARNING
BUT
DOES
NOT
FOLLOW
THROUGH
WITH
IT
THE
CHILDREN
WILL
NOT
TAKE
THAT
PARENTS
WORDS
VERY
SERIOUSLY
GOD
DOES
THE
SAME
BY
TELLING
US
WHO
HAVE
EARS
TO
HEAR
WHAT
TO
DO
AND
WHAT
NOT
TO
DO
BY
LIFES
TRIALS
WE
SEE
THE
FOLLY
OF
DOING
OUR
OWN
WILL
RATHER
THAN
HIS
HE
WARNS
US
ABOUT
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
REJECTING
HIM
WHEN
IT
COMES
TIME
FOR
JUDGEMENT
SORRY
WAS
THAT
THE
GOD
OF
THE
BIBLE
WHOSE
RULES
I
AM
TO
FOLLOW
OR
THE
GOD
OF
THE
KORAN
THE
VEDAS
THE
BOOK
OF
KORESH
OH
YES
ITS
ALL
SO
CLEAR
DO
WE
FOLLOW
HIM
I
WILL
BULLY
FOR
YOU
