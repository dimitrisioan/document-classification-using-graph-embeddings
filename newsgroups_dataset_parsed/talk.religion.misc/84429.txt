i
merely
point
out
that
it
is
a
valid
strategy
which
is
used
every
day
furthermore
we
dont
know
of
any
substitute
strategy
capable
of
apprehending
potentially
dangerous
and
armed
suspects
do
you
suggest
that
the
police
always
knock
with
guns
holstered
and
never
arrest
any
suspects
until
they
have
been
allowed
to
inspect
the
officerss
badges
just
what
should
the
police
do
when
apprehending
potentially
dangerous
and
armed
suspects
how
far
can
they
reasonably
go
to
identiy
themselves
what
do
you
suggest
they
can
do
which
cant
be
faked
by
the
competition
so
instead
you
are
asking
individual
citizens
to
place
themselves
at
risk
by
assuming
that
everyone
who
claims
to
be
a
cop
actually
is
a
cop
around
here
the
police
have
actually
made
public
service
announcements
saying
that
if
you
are
a
lady
driving
by
yourself
at
night
and
you
see
blue
lights
flashing
behind
you
do
not
pull
over
until
you
reach
a
well
lit
preferably
occupied
place
gas
station
etc
even
if
youve
got
deadly
enemies
who
may
pretend
to
be
cops
thats
not
an
excuse
to
murder
police
it
wouldnt
be
murder
it
would
be
self
defense
mob
rule
isnt
any
prettier
merely
because
the
mob
calls
itself
a
government
it
aint
charity
if
you
are
using
someone
elses
money
wilsons
theory
of
relativity
if
you
go
back
far
enough
were
all
