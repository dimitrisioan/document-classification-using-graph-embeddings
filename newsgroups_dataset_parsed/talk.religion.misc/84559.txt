because
of
course
that
possibility
existed
meaning
any
student
who
really
gave
a
shit
could
have
a
moment
of
silence
on
hisher
own
which
makes
more
sense
than
forcing
those
who
dont
want
to
participate
to
have
to
take
part
what
other
reason
is
there
for
an
organized
moment
of
silence
a
moment
of
silence
doesnt
mean
much
unless
everyone
participates
otherwise
its
not
silent
now
is
it
the
whole
point
is
maybe
everyone
doesnt
want
to
participate
blindly
opposing
everything
with
a
flavor
of
religion
in
it
is
utterly
idiotic
blindly
opposing
everything
with
a
flavor
of
religion
in
it
that
is
supported
by
taxpayer
money
is
the
only
way
to
keep
christianity
from
becoming
the
official
us
religion
not
noticing
that
danger
is
utterly
idiotic
please
provide
evidence
that
having
a
moment
of
silence
for
a
student
who
died
tragically
costs
taxpayers
money
