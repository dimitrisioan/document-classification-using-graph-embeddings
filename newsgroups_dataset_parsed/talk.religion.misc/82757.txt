RE

AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
MAGARRETMAGNUSACSOHIOSTATEEDU
COMPUTER
DUDETTE
WRITES
I
JUST
RECENTLY
REALIZED
THAT
I
AM
BISEXUAL
AND
ALSO
JUST
RECENTLY
RETURNED
TO
RELIGION
AND
HAVE
A
GOOD
FRIEND
WHO
HAS
POINTED
OUT
TO
ME
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
A
SIN
IN
THE
BIBLE
WELL
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
IT
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
A
SIN
FIRST
OF
ALL
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
ONLY
MALE
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
EXPLICITLY
MENTIONED
IN
THE
BIBLES
SO
YOURE
OFF
THE
HOOK
THERE
I
THINK
IN
ANY
EVENT
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
PEOPLE
IN
MANY
DENOMINATIONS
WHO
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
A
PERSONS
SEXUAL
IDENTIFICATION
OF
GAYLESBIANBISEXUAL
AS
AN
IMMORAL
LIFESTYLE
CHOICE
ALSO
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
A
SOMEWHAT
LIBERAL
FEMINIST
AND
AM
PROCHOICE
AND
IT
SEEMS
THAT
BEING
PROCHOICE
AND
BEING
RELIGIOUS
DONT
MIX
EITHER
I
AM
TOLD
THIS
IS
ANOTHER
MISCONCEPTION
YOU
ARE
NOT
BEING
TOLD
THE
WHOLE
STORY
MY
FORMER
MINISTER
IS
A
LESBIAN
AND
I
KNOW
PERSONALLY
AND
PROFESSIONALLY
SEVERAL
OPENLY
GAY
AND
LESBIAN
MINISTERS
I
AM
A
UNITARIANUNIVERSALIST
AND
LIKE
MOST
OTHERS
IN
MY
DENOMINATION
AM
PROCHOICE
YOU
NEEDNT
GO
LOOKING
TO
THE
UNITARIAN
UNIVERSALISTS
WHICH
IS
A
LIBERAL
RELIGION
FOR
ACCEPTANCE
OF
YOUR
SEXUAL
IDENTIFICATION
AND
PROCHOICE
VIEWS
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
MANY
OF
US
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
SPIRITUALITY
AND
FREEDOM
OF
CONSCIENCE
GOOD
LUCK
ON
YOUR
JOURNEY
