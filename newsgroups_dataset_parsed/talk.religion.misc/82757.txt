i
just
recently
realized
that
i
am
bisexual
and
also
just
recently
returned
to
religion
and
have
a
good
friend
who
has
pointed
out
to
me
that
homosexuality
is
a
sin
in
the
bible
well
i
dont
see
how
it
could
be
considered
a
sin
first
of
all
as
far
as
i
know
only
male
homosexuality
is
explicitly
mentioned
in
the
bibles
so
youre
off
the
hook
there
i
think
in
any
event
there
are
plenty
of
people
in
many
denominations
who
do
not
consider
a
persons
sexual
identification
of
gaylesbianbisexual
as
an
immoral
lifestyle
choice
also
i
have
always
been
a
somewhat
liberal
feminist
and
am
prochoice
and
it
seems
that
being
prochoice
and
being
religious
dont
mix
either
i
am
told
this
is
another
misconception
you
are
not
being
told
the
whole
story
my
former
minister
is
a
lesbian
and
i
know
personally
and
professionally
several
openly
gay
and
lesbian
ministers
i
am
a
unitarianuniversalist
and
like
most
others
in
my
denomination
am
prochoice
you
neednt
go
looking
to
the
unitarian
universalists
which
is
a
liberal
religion
for
acceptance
of
your
sexual
identification
and
prochoice
views
however
there
are
many
of
us
who
believe
in
spirituality
and
freedom
of
conscience
good
luck
on
your
journey
