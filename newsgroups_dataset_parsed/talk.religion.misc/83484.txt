JON
LIVESEY
IF
THERE
IS
A
WESTERN
ETHIC
AGAINST
INFANTICIDE
WHY
ARE
SO
MANY
CHILDREN
DYING
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
WORLD
ISNT
WESTERN
SUPERFICIALLY
A
GOOD
ANSWER
BUT
IT
ISNT
THAT
SIMPLE
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
THE
STARVATION
AND
POVERTY
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
DIRECTLY
CAUSED
BY
THE
ECONOMIC
POLICIES
OF
THE
WESTERN
COUNTRIES
AS
WELL
AS
BY
THE
DIET
OF
THE
TYPICAL
WESTERNER
FOR
INSTANCE
SOME
THIRDWORLD
COUNTRIES
WITH
TERRIBLE
MALNUTRITION
PROBLEMS
EXPORT
ALL
THE
SOYA
THEY
CAN
PRODUCE
SO
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
FED
TO
CATTLE
IN
THE
US
TO
MAKE
TENDER
JUICY
STEAKS
AND
BURGERS
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
THIS
TO
GET
MONEY
TO
PAY
THE
INTEREST
ON
THE
CRIPPLING
BANK
LOANS
WE
ENCOURAGED
THEM
TO
TAKE
OUT
FUNDRAISING
FOR
ETHIOPIA
IS
A
TRULY
BIZARRE
IDEA
INSTEAD
WE
OUGHT
TO
STOP
BLEEDING
THEM
FOR
EVERY
PENNY
THEYVE
GOT
PERHAPS
ITS
MORE
ACCURATE
TO
SAY
THAT
THERES
A
WESTERN
ETHIC
AGAINST
WESTERN
INFANTICIDE
ALL
THE
EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS
THAT
SO
LONG
AS
THE
CHILDREN
ARE
DYING
IN
THE
THIRD
WORLD
WE
COULDNT
GIVE
A
SHIT
AND
THAT
GOES
FOR
THE
SUPPOSED
PROLIFE
MOVEMENT
TOO
THEY
COULD
SAVE
FAR
MORE
LIVES
BY
FIGHTING
AGAINST
THIRD
WORLD
DEBT
THAN
THEY
WILL
BY
FIGHTING
AGAINST
ABORTION
HELL
IF
THEYRE
ONLY
INTERESTED
IN
FETUSES
THEY
COULD
SAVE
MORE
OF
THOSE
BY
FIGHTING
FOR
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IN
CHINA
AND
BESIDES
SUZANNES
ANSWER
IMPLIES
THAT
NONWESTERN
COUNTRIES
LACK
THIS
ETHIC
AGAINST
INFANTICIDE
APART
FROM
CHINA
WITH
ITS
POLICY
OF
MANDATORY
FORCED
ABORTION
IN
TIBET
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THIS
TO
BE
THE
CASE
