THIS
HUGE
GUILT
FEELING
HANGING

WILL
TELL
YOU
ANOTHER
SECRET
I
GET
THIS
BURNING
SENSATION
IN
MY

IT
HERE
THE
LESS
ITLL
HURT

JUST
WANT
TO
DO
IVE

THE
RIGHT

YOUR

FEELS
PAIN
TO
LET

WRONG
ITS
YOUR
BODYS
ALARM
SYSTEM
INFORMING
YOU
THAT
SOMETHING
NEEDS
YOUR
ATTENTION
A
FEVER
TELLS
YOU
THAT
YOU
ARE
SICK
AND
NEED
SOME
SORT
OF
CARE
GUILT
CAN
BE
SEEN
AS
THAT
EMOTIONAL
OR
SPIRITUAL
ALARM
JUST
INFORMING
YOU
THAT
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
YOUVE
DONE
THAT
REQUIRES
YOUR
ATTENTION
IT
DOESNT
REQUIRE
A
PERSONALITY
TYPE
TO
BECOME
A
BELIEVER
IT
REQUIRES
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
THEMSELVES
THEIR
BODY
SOUL
ALL
I
KNOW
IS
THAT
I
DONT
KNOW
EVERYTHING

NOT
PERFECT
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
HINDER
ME
FROM
HAVE
A
HEALTHY
AND
INSPIRING
LIFE
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
ALL
I
KNEW
IS
I
REALLY
LIKED
DROPPING
CID
LSD
FRANKLY
SPEAKING
I
DIDNT
REALLY
CARE
IT
WAS
FUN
ANYWAY
IT
DIDNT
MATTER
THAT
EVERY
CHILD
MY
WIFE
AND
I
WANT
TO
HAVE
ARE
AT
A
TREMENDOUSLY
GREATER
RISK
OF
SERIOUS
BIRTH
DEFECTS
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
ALL
I
KNEW
IS
I
REALLY
LIKED
HAVING
SEX
WITH
AS
MANY
WOMEN
AS
I
COULD
CONVICE
FRANKLY
SPEAKING
I
DIDNT
CARE
I
DIDNT
CARE
THAT
I
WAS
PUTTING
EACH
ONE
OF
THEM
AT
RISK
AS
WELL
AS
THEIR
FUTURE
PARTNERS
IT
DIDNT
MATTER
THAT
FOR
THE
FIRST
DECADE
OF
MY
MARRIAGE
MY
WIFE
AND
I
WILL
HAVE
THE
WORRY
THAT
POSSIBLY
THAT
LAST
SNEEZE
MEANT
SOMETHING
MUCH
WORSE
THAN
A
COLD
THERE
ARE
HUMANS

THAT
WHEN
