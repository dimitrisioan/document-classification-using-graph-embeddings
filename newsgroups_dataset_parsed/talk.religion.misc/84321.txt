hmm
it
seems
that
this
is
the
core
of
christianity
then
you
have
to
feel
guilty
and
then
theres
this
single
personality
that
will
save
you
from
this
universal
guilt
feeling
brian
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
i
dont
feel
guilty
at
all
i
do
mistakes
and
i
regret
them
however
ive
never
had
this
huge
guilt
feeling
hanging
over
my
shoulder
i
will
tell
you
another
secret
i
get
this
burning
sensation
in
my
hand
every
time
i
hold
it
over
a
candle
the
pain
does
not
fill
my
entire
body
and
im
told
the
longer
i
hold
it
here
the
less
itll
hurt
itll
eventually
burn
up
the
nerves
or
so
im
told
so
i
suppose
i
should
just
ignore
the
pain
because
holding
my
hand
over
the
candle
is
something
i
just
want
to
do
ive
got
the
right
dont
i
your
body
feels
pain
to
let
you
know
something
is
wrong
its
your
bodys
alarm
system
informing
you
that
something
needs
your
attention
a
fever
tells
you
that
you
are
sick
and
need
some
sort
of
care
guilt
can
be
seen
as
that
emotional
or
spiritual
alarm
just
informing
you
that
there
is
something
that
youve
done
that
requires
your
attention
it
doesnt
require
a
personality
type
to
become
a
believer
it
requires
someone
who
is
willing
to
listen
to
themselves
their
body
soul
all
i
know
is
that
i
dont
know
everything
and
frankly
speaking
i
dont
care
life
is
fun
anyway
i
recognize
that
im
not
perfect
but
that
does
not
hinder
me
from
have
a
healthy
and
inspiring
life
for
several
years
all
i
knew
is
i
really
liked
dropping
cid
lsd
frankly
speaking
i
didnt
really
care
it
was
fun
anyway
it
didnt
matter
that
every
child
my
wife
and
i
want
to
have
are
at
a
tremendously
greater
risk
of
serious
birth
defects
for
several
years
all
i
knew
is
i
really
liked
having
sex
with
as
many
women
as
i
could
convice
frankly
speaking
i
didnt
care
i
didnt
care
that
i
was
putting
each
one
of
them
at
risk
as
well
as
their
future
partners
it
didnt
matter
that
for
the
first
decade
of
my
marriage
my
wife
and
i
will
have
the
worry
that
possibly
that
last
sneeze
meant
something
much
worse
than
a
cold
there
are
humans
that
subscribe
to
the
same
notion
the
nice
thing
is
that
when
you
finally
shake
off
this
huge
burden
the
shoulders
feel
far
more
relaxed
the
nice
thing
about
pain
killers
if
you
take
enough
you
wont
care
about
the
fever
shortness
of
breath
or
pain
