brian
k
please
step
aside
before
you
get
run
over
bk
there
is
no
truck
me
turn
around
at
look
bk
no
me
look
you
will
be
healthier
if
you
do
take
a
look
at
the
oncoming
truck
bk
no
explain
to
me
why
trucks
exist
me
turn
around
or
you
will
run
over
bk
no
i
wont
because
i
like
hiking
and
tomorrow
is
tuesday
me
you
blind
fool
why
do
you
choose
ignorance
you
have
nothing
to
lose
if
you
look
but
if
do
not
look
you
will
certainly
lose
your
life
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
squashed
all
over
the
road
bk
it
is
my
life
to
lose
i
rather
not
look
besides
a
truck
running
over
me
will
not
harm
me
and
by
the
way
i
really
have
an
open
mind
i
think
the
discussion
is
more
like
this
me
happily
picking
daisies
by
the
side
of
the
road
bc
dancing
on
the
double
yellow
broken
line
come
on
out
and
play
on
the
highway
me
why
bc
the
highway
was
put
here
for
people
to
be
on
we
must
work
towards
fulfilling
its
purpose
me
but
bc
look
the
highway
has
been
here
for
several
generations
look
i
have
a
story
about
how
it
was
actually
created
by
a
divine
being
and
several
people
actually
saw
elvis
bless
it
me
but
bc
look
are
you
going
to
come
out
here
or
not
me
but
bc
you
probably
think
that
picking
daisies
is
fun
well
youre
wrong
me
where
in
blazes
did
you
get
this
silly
idea
that
youre
supposed
to
be
playing
on
the
highway
youll
get
yourself
killed
bc
better
to
be
killed
on
the
highway
than
to
live
an
empty
life
off
of
it
besides
youre
just
asking
pointless
questions
you
know
you
really
want
to
be
playing
on
the
highway
too
youre
just
denying
it
me
if
you
want
to
get
run
over
then
fine
but
id
much
rather
enjoy
the
daisies
if
you
please
bc
why
do
you
shun
me
like
this
the
creator
of
the
highway
will
flatten
you
with
a
steamroller
if
you
dont
see
the
light
and
come
join
me
me
well
if
hes
gonna
be
that
way
about
it
maybe
i
want
to
get
as
far
from
the
highway
as
i
can
bc
incoherent
but
quite
familiar
righteous
sputtering
brian
c
dont
you
see
i
do
not
believe
that
your
god
is
a
real
or
even
b
beneficial
in
fact
i
believe
your
religion
is
imaginary
and
carried
to
extremes
harmful
i
would
like
to
help
you
see
its
shortcomings
and
perhaps
someday
finally
become
strong
enough
to
see
it
for
what
it
is
an
elaborate
lie
kept
alive
by
the
elite
priesthood
to
keep
the
masses
properly
submissive
to
their
influences
please
offer
me
an
argument
thats
more
convincing
than
you
just
dont
believe
cos
you
dont
want
to
everything
youve
said
so
far
could
apply
equally
to
any
religion
why
do
you
believe
yours
is
the
real
one
note
that
saying
its
the
only
one
that
promises
eternal
life
or
something
like
that
isnt
an
answer
to
my
question
unless
you
show
that
a
no
other
religion
promises
eternal
life
and
b
it
is
unarguably
true
that
eternal
life
must
be
a
reality
