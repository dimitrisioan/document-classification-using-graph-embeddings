IN

TIMSMEGATEKCOM
WRITES
LET
US
NOT
LIMIT
MISCTAOISM
TO
PHILOSOPHY
BUT
IF
WE
DONT
LIMIT
IT
TO
SOMETHING
THE
DISCUSSION
DEGENERATES
INTO
A
BIG
AMORPHOUS
GLOB
HMMARE
YOU
A
TAOIST
IMPOSING
LIMITS
DOES
DO
SOMETHING
USEFULIT
GIVES
YOU
SOMETHING
TO
GO
BEYOND
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THESE
QUESTIONS
MORE
PROPERLY
FALL
INTO
THE
CATEGORY
OF
GENERAL
METAPHYSICS
I
WOULD
PREFER
ANY
MISCTAOISM
TO
DEAL
MORE
CLOSELY
WITH
TOPICS
AND
WORKS
MORE
CLOSELY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
AT
LEAST
SEMIORTHODOX
TAOISM
WITH
ESTABLISHED
CLASSIC
WORKS
DEFINITELY
INCLUDED
AND
WORKS
LIKE
MANTAK
CHIAS
ARGUED
ABOUT
I
TEND
TO
BE
A
BIT
CRITICAL
OF
ANY
STRATIFICATION
OF
TAOISM
I
ESPECIALLY
TEND
TO
FROWN
ON
ANY
SUGGESTION
THAT
ORTHODOXY
OR
CLASSICS
HAVE
ANY
SPECIAL
PLACE
IN
TAO
I
THINK
NEOTAOISM
SHOULD
BE
EXCLUDED
OR
GET
ITS
OWN
GROUP
WHAT
I
MEAN
BY
THIS
IS
HUMPTYDUMPTY
TAOISM
IN
WHICH
TAOISM
MEANS
WHATEVER
A
POSTER
SAYS
IT
MEANS
THIS
ALTTAOISM
COULD
ALSO
BE
A
REFUGE
FOR
DEBATES
ABOUT
WHAT
TAOISM
REALLY
MEANS
OR
SPECULATIONS
ON
SEXUAL
ALCHEMY
ETC
SO
RATHER
THAN
DEBATE
WHAT
TAOISM
REALLY
MEANS
YOU
ARE
SUGGESTING
THAT
WE
TAKE
SOMEONE
ELSES
WORD
FOR
IT
AND
WORK
THUSLY
ID
RATHER
NOT
THANK
YOU
WHATS
HAPPENING
IS
THAT
THAT
THE
TERM
TAOISM
IS
BECOMING
COMPLETELY
POLLUTED
AND
TRIVIALIZED
LIKE
THE
WORDS
MAGIC
ALCHEMY
ZEN
ETC
BY
WRITERS
APPROPRIATING
THE
WORD
TO
MEAN
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
THIS
IS
SEEN
BY
THE
SPATE
OF
NEW
AGE
BOOKS
ENTITLED
THE
TAO
OF
THIS
THAT
AND
EVERYTHING
ELSE
WHEREAS
YOU
OF
COURSE
HAVE
A
CLEAR
IDEA
OF
WHAT
THE
WORD
MEANS
CAN
YOU
TELL
THE
TAO
ANY
OTHER
COMMENTSIDEAS
I
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
SEEING
THEM
ON
BALANCE
I
SAY
LET
MISCTAOISM
RIP
AND
LET
THE
CHIPS
FALL
WHERE
THEY
MAY
WONDERFUL
IDEA
IT
JUST
GETS
FILLED
UP
WITH
COLLEGE
FRESHMEN
ASKING
ABOUT
THE
TAO
OF
SEX
THEN
IT
WILL
HAVE
BEEN
A
FAILURE
AND
PEOPLE
WILL
POST
TO
THESE
GROUPS
JUST
AS
THEY
DO
NOW
ONLY
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
DEFINE
FAILURE
IN
THAT
WAY
OR
TO
DEFINE
IT
AT
ALL
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
FLESH
AND
THE
APPETITES
SEEING
HEARING
AND
FEELING
ARE
MIRACLES
AND
EACH
PART
AND
TAG
OF
ME
IS
A
MIRACLE
