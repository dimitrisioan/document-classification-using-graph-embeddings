obviously
if
people
are

there
they
would

correct

implies
a

this
is
exactly
what
it
has
become
a
far
cry
from
its
original
position
of

lets
see
if
alexander
destroyed
tyre
and
people
move
back
and
they
construct
houses
and
after
a
while
people
live
there
and
still
call
it
tyre
it
is
not
considered
to
be
rebuilt
instead
its
considered

we
are
talking

sigh
i
was
never
born
in
a
city
then
my
home
town
has
people
i
have
to
consult
my
city
and
inform
them
that
its
from
now
a
fishing
village
when
this
city
kristinestad
was
founded
in
the
century
about
people
lived
there
so
the
norms
were
even
more
bizarre
for
dumb
swedish
queens
who
founded
cities
along
the
coast
of
finland
i
would
like
to
know
why
paul
thought
is
was
worth
mentioning
the
small
fishing
place
of
tyre
in
acts
again
maybe
he
was
a
keen
fisherman
and
wanted
to
visit
the
shores
of
tyre
