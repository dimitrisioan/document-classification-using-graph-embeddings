if
one
is
paying
for
a
private
health
insurance
plan
and
does
not
want
abortion
coverage
there
is
no
reason
for
that
person
to
be
complelled
to
pay
for
it
just
as
one
should
not
be
compelled
to
pay
for
lipposuction
coverage
if
one
doesnt
want
that
kind
of
coverage
you
appear
to
be
stunningly
ignorant
of
the
underlying
concept
of
health
insurance
