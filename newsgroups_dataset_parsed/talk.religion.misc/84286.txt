WHAT

HISTORICLY
NEVER

LETS
CONSIDER
SOME
PERSONAL
INTERPRETATIONS
AND
SEE
HOW
MUCH
TRUST
WE
SHOULD
PUT
IN
ORTHODOX
MORMONISM
WHICH
COULD
NEVER
BE
CONFUSED
WITH
ORTHODOX
CHRISTIANITY
IN
ONE
OF
HIS

MCCONKIE
SAID
THEY
THRASH
AROUND
INDARKNESS
IN
TRYING
TO
IDENTIFY
ELOHIM
AND
JEHOVAH
AND
TO
SHOW
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
TO
THE
PROMISED
MESSIAH
HE
ALSO
SAID
CHRISTIANS
ARE
WRONG
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
JEHOVAH
IS
THE
SUPREME
DEITY
GOD
THE
FATHER
AND
THAT
CHRIST
CAME
INTO
MORTALITY
AS
HIS
ONLY
BEGOTTEN
SON
MCCONKIE
THEN
STATED
WHAT
MORMONS
BELIEVE
TODAY
TO
BE
THE
TRUTH
ABOUT
THE
MATTER
HE
SAID
THAT
ELOHIM
IS
THE
FATHER
AND
JEHOVAH
IS
THE
SON
BEING
THUS
AWARE
OF
HOW
FAR
ASTRAY
THE
RELIGIOUS
INTELLECTUALISTS
HAVE
GONE
IN
DEFINING
THEIR
THREEINONE

IT
COMES
AS
NO
SURPRISE
TO
LEARN
THAT
THEY
THRASH
AROUND
IN
THE
SAME
DARKNESS
IN
TRYING
TO
IDENTIFY
ELOHIM
AND
JEHOVAH
AND
TO
SHOW
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
TO
THE
PROMISED

SECTARIANS
EVEN
BELIEVE
THAT
JEHOVAH
IS
THE
SUPREME
DEITY
WHOSE
SON
CAME
INTO
MORTALITY
AS
THE
ONLY
BEGOTTEN
AS
WITH
THEIR
CONCEPT
THAT
GOD
IS
A
SPIRIT
THIS
MISINFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
GODS
OF

IS
UNTRUE
THE
FACT
IS
AND
IT
TOO
IS
ATTESTED

THERE

THE
FALSE

THAT
THE
CHILDREN
OF

DID

THIS
EXAMINATION
HAS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
ELOHIM
OF
MORMONISM
LIKE
THE
ELOHIM
IN
JU
IS
NOT
THE
TRUE
JEHOVAH
ELOHIM
THEREFORE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
LEAVE
THE
TRUE
ELOHIM
FOR
THE
MORMON
ELOHIM
WILL
DO
EVILIN
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
LORD
JEHOVAH
ALTHOUGH
MCCONKIE
ATTACKED
CHRISTIANS
FOR
THEIR
BELIEF
IN
A
TRIUNE
GOD
WHO
IS
SPIRIT
AND
FOR
THEIR
BELIEF
THAT
GOD
THE
FATHER
JEHOVAH
SENT
HIS
SON
INTO
THE
WORLD
THESE
BELIEFS
ARE
TRUE
GOD
IS
TRIUNE
HE
IS
SPIRIT
HE
IS
JEHOVAH
AND
HE
DID
SEND
HIS
SON
INTO
THE
WORLD
TO
REDEEM
MANKIND
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
FROM
THIS
EXAMINATION
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
THRASH
AROUND
INDARKNESS
ABOUT
WHO
ELOHIM
AND
JEHOVAH
ARE
ONE
WONDERS
WHAT
HOLY
WRIT
MCCONKIE
HAD
IN
MIND
WHEN
HE
STATED
THAT
IT
ATTESTS
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
ELOHIM
IS
THE
FATHER
AND
THAT
JEHOVAH
IS
THE
SON
HE
CERTAINLY
DID
NOT
MEAN
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
TEACHES
THAT
THE
FATHER
SON
AND
HOLY
SPIRIT
ARE
ALL
THE
ONE
JEHOVAH
ELOHIM
HE
APPARENTLY
DID
NOT
MEAN
THE
DC
EITHER
BECAUSE
CHAPTER
VERSES
REFER
TO
THE
FATHER
AS
JEHOVAH
SUMMARY
OBVIOUSLY
JOSEPH
FIELDING
SMITHS
STATEMENT
THAT
THE
MORMONS
HAVE
A
CLEAR
AND
PERFECT
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
GOD
DOCTRINES
OF
SALVATION
IS
NOT
ACCURATE
THE
MORMON
GODS
ARE
NOT
THE
TRUE
GOD
AS
MORMONISM
CLAIMS
BUT
ARE
IDOLS
WHICH
CAUSE
THEIR
FOLLOWERS
TO
COMMIT
ADULTERY
AGAINST
GOD
AND
IDOLATRY
IN
ANSWER
TO
JESUS
QUESTION
BUT
WHOM
SAY
YE
THAT
I
AM
MORMONS
SAY
JESUS
IS
SOMEONE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
JESUS
WHO
IS
REVEALED
IN
THE
BIBLE
AND
WHOM
THE
APOSTLES
PREACHED
THEREFORE
ANYONE
TRUSTING
IN
THE
MORMON
JESUS
IS
BELIEVING
IN
ANOTHER
JESUS
WHOM
PAUL
WARNED
ABOUT

BROCKBANK
OF
THE
FIRST
QUORUM
OF
THE
SEVENTY
ADMITTED
IN
THE
MAY
ISSUE
OF
THE
ENSIGN
A
MORMON
PUBLICATION
THAT
THE
MORMON
JESUS
IS
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
CHRISTIAN
JESUS
HE
STATED
THAT
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
CHURCHES
WORSHIP
A
DIFFERENT
JESUS
CHRIST
THAN
IS
WORSHIPPED
BY
THE
MORMONS
OR
THE
CHURCH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
OF
LATTERDAY
SAINTS
P
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
MORMON
JESUS
ARE
COMMITTING
ADULTERY
AGAINST
GOD
AND
IDOLATRY
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
SON
THEREFORE
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
FATHER
AND
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
ETERNAL

AS
THE

MCCONKIE
RIGHTLY
STATED
SALVATION
COMES
ONLY
BY
WORSHIPING
THE
TRUE
GOD
PROMISED
MESSIAH
P
MCCONKIE
ALSO
RIGHTLY
STATED
THAT
THE
MERE
WORSHIP
OF
A
GOD
WHO
HAS
THE
PROPER
SCRIPTURAL
NAMES
DOES
NOT
ASSURE
ONE
THAT
HE
IS
WORSHIPING
THE
TRUE
AND
LIVING
GOD
BECAUSE
THE
TRUE
NAMES
OF
DEITY
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
FALSE
CONCEPTS
OF

DOCTRINE
P
REMEMBER
THAT
THE

ADMITTED
THAT
JOSEPH

GAVE
A

AND
THE

IT
IS
IMPORTANT
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
LEFT
THE
TRUE
TRIUNE
GOD
REVEALED
IN
THE

TO
REPENT
AND
RETURN
TO
HIM
THEY
MUST
FORSAKE
THE
SINS
OF
IDOLATRY
AND
ADULTERY
WHICH
THEY
ARE
COMMITTING
IN
MORMONISM
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
ALL
THAT
FORSAKE
THEE
SHALL
BE
ASHAMED
AND
THEY
THAT
DEPART
FROM

SHALL
BE

IN
