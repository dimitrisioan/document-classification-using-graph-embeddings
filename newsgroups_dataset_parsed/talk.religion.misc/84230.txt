IF
ALMOST
ALL
PEOPLE
AGREE
THAT
THE
SUN
EXISTS
IN
THE
USUAL
UNCRITICAL
SENSE
AND
ALMOST
ALL
PEOPLE
AGREE
THAT
A
DEAL
IS
BAD
ITS
A
REASONABLE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
SUN
REALLY
DOES
EXIST
AND
THAT
THE
DEAL
REALLY
IS
BAD
I
DISAGREE
COMPLETELY
UNTIL
RATHER
RECENTLY
MOST
PEOPLE
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
EVOLUTION
OR
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
THE
ATOM
BOMB
POPULAR
OPINION
IS
NOTORIOUSLY
WRONG
ABOUT
MATTERS
OF
FACT
TRUE
BUT
NEVERTHELESS
THE
BASIS
OF
ALL
MATTERS
OF
FACT
IS
OVERWHELMING
POPULAR
OPINION
AND
SOME
OVERWHELMING
POPULAR
OPINION
IS
FACT
THE
SUN
SHINES
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
SO
PHYSICS
WOULD
BE
A
PERSONAL
MATTER
ASSUMED
TO
BE
DIFFERENT
FOR
EACH
OF
US
THERE
WOULD
BE
YOURGRAVITY
AND
MYGRAVITY
AND
NO
THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK
TO
ENCOMPASS
THEM
AND
PREDICT
BOTH
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
COMPLETE
NONSENSE
THE
BASIS
FOR
MATTERS
OF
FACT
IS
IF
ANY
CLASS
OF
OPINION
THE
MAJORITY
OF
INFORMED
POPULAR
OPINION
FOR
SOME
VALUE
OF
INFORMED
I
WOULD
REALLY
HATE
TO
BASE
MY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
FOR
INSTANCE
QM
ON
WHAT
THE
OVERWHELMING
POPULAR
OPINION
IS
THE
BASIS
ERIC
IS
PEOPLE
PEERING
AT
THE
WORLD
AND
SAYING
WHAT
THEY
SEE
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
UNINTERPRETED
FACTS
OBSERVATIONS
PEOPLE
DO
THOSE
AGREEMENT
ON
SOME
OBSERVATIONS
IS
A
PREREQUISITE
FOR
A
THEORY
THAT
IS
MORE
THAN
PERSONAL
YES
THATS
TRUE
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
CLEAR
EXACTLY
WHAT
IS
AN
UNINTERPRETED
OBSERVATION
ITS
PRETTY
LOW
LEVEL
STUFF
THE
SUN
SHINES
IS
ALREADY
A
LOT
HIGHER
LEVEL
THAN
THAT
WE
CAN
AGREE
THAT
I
PERCEIVE
BRIGHTNESS
PERHAPS
NOW
I
TAKE
AN
EXPERIENCE
OF
GOODEVIL
TO
BE
EVERY
BIT
AS
RAW
A
FACT
AS
AN
EXPERIENCE
OF
PAIN
OR
VISION
THAT
MIGHT
SEEM
LIKE
A
GOOD
FIRST
PASS
GUESS
BUT
IT
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
A
PRETTY
CRUDDY
WAY
TO
LOOK
AT
THINGS
BECAUSE
WE
ALL
SEEM
TO
HAVE
RATHER
DIFFERENT
OPINIONS
EXPERIENCES
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
GOOD
AND
EVIL
WHILE
WE
SEEM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
AGREE
ON
WHAT
THE
METER
SAYS
YOURE
NOT
COMPARING
APPLES
WITH
APPLES
IF
WE
ALL
LOOK
AT
THE
SAME
METER
WELL
AGREE
IF
WERE
ALL
IN
THE
SAME
SITUATION
THATS
WHEN
WELL
AGREE
ON
FUNDAMENTAL
VALUES
IF
AT
ALL
PEOPLE
WHO
SAY
THAT
NOBODY
AGREES
ON
VALUES
TO
THE
SAME
EXTENT
THAT
THEY
AGREE
ON
TRIVIAL
OBSERVATIONS
SEEM
TO
BE
UNAWARE
OF
THE
EXTENT
OF
AGREEMENT
ON
EITHER
HUH
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
ALL
IN
THE
SAME
SITUATION
LETS
TAKE
ME
AND
DENNIS
KRIZ
AS
EXAMPLES
WERE
IN
PRETTY
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
BUT
I
THINK
WE
CAN
AGREE
AS
TO
WHETHER
ITS
DAY
OR
NIGHT
I
DONT
THINK
WE
CAN
AGREE
AS
TO
WHETHER
OR
NOT
ABORTION
IS
MORALLY
ACCEPTABLE
YET
WE
ARE
CERTAINLY
IN
THE
SAME
DIFFERENCE
OF
SITUATIONS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
EACH
OTHER
LOOKS
LIKE
WEASELWORDS
TO
ME
FRANK
I
DONT
SEE
THAT
ITS
ANY
EVIDENCE
AT
ALL
AS
I
POINT
OUT
ABOVE
IM
REALLY
NOT
INTERESTED
VERY
MUCH
IN
WHAT
THE
POPULAR
OPINION
IS
IM
PREPARED
TO
TRUSTTO
SOME
EXTENT
THE
POPULAR
OPINION
ABOUT
DIRECT
MATTERS
OF
PHYSICAL
OBSERVATION
BECAUSE
BY
AND
LARGE
THEY
ACCORD
WITH
MY
OWN
HOWEVER
IF
EVERYONE
ELSE
SAID
THE
DIAL
READ
AND
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
A
TO
ME
I
WOULD
HOPE
THAT
I
WOULD
BELIEVE
MYSELF
IE
BELIEVING
OTHER
PEOPLE
ABOUT
THESE
MATTERS
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
A
REASONABLE
PROBABILITY
OF
PREDICTING
WHAT
I
WOULD
BELIEVE
IF
I
OBSERVED
MYSELF
BUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
EXISTS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
SINCE
I
KNOW
FROM
OBSERVATION
THAT
OTHERS
DISAGREE
WITH
ME
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
GOOD
I
BELIEVE
I
CAN
DISCOUNT
POPULAR
OPINION
ABOUT
GOOD
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
AS
A
PREDICTOR
OF
MY
OPINION
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
SEEMS
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
GET
PEOPLE
TO
AGREE
ON
WHAT
IS
GOOD
IN
A
REALLY
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
SITUATIONS
IS
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
EVIDENCE
THAT
OBJECTIVE
MORALITY
IS
BOGUS
ACTUALLY
FIRSTLY
IF
EVERYONE
ELSE
SAID
THE
DIAL
WAS
AND
I
SAW
ID
CHECK
MY
LENS
PRESCRIPTION
THATS
UP
TO
YOU
I
GUESS
SECONDLY
YOUR
OBSERVATION
THAT
PEOPLE
DISAGREE
SHOWS
NOTHING
PEOPLE
MAY
BE
LOOKING
AT
DIFFERENT
THINGS
BY
VIRTUE
OF
BEING
IN
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
IF
I
LOOK
AT
AN
ELEPHANT
ILL
SEE
AN
ELEPHANT
THAT
DOESNT
IMPLY
THAT
YOU
WILL
SEE
AN
ELEPHANT
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
AN
IGUANA
THIS
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
STUFF
IS
PRETTY
CONFUSING
FRANK
HOW
DO
WE
DECIDE
IF
WE
ARE
IN
THE
SAME
SITUATION
YOU
MIND
EXPLAINING
THIRDLY
I
QUESTION
YOUR
ASSUMPTION
THAT
WHEN
PEOPLE
DISAGREE
ABOUT
HOW
TO
ACHIEVE
FUNDAMENTAL
OR
SECONDARY
GOALS
THAT
THEY
THEREFORE
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
SAME
FUNDAMENTAL
GOALS
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
DISAGREEMENT
YOU
REFER
TO
HUH
I
DONT
THINK
SO
I
THINK
THAT
PEOPLE
DISAGREE
ABOUT
FUNDAMENTAL
GOALS
