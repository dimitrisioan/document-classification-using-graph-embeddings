ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
he
is
god
in
other
words
the
right
of
might
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
he
is
god
in
other
words
the
right
of
might
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
god
granted
you
the
gift
of
life
whether
you
were
sinner
or
saint
in
other
words
he
can
do
it
he
did
it
and
your
in
no
position
to
argue
about
it
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
the
scientist
creates
the
living
creature
to
examine
it
poke
and
prod
it
and
learn
about
its
behaviour
he
will
kill
it
if
it
becomes
a
threat
for
example
lets
say
the
scientist
creates
a
tyrannosaurus
rex
and
it
breaks
free
of
its
confines
and
starts
devouring
the
population
the
scientist
would
not
hesitate
in
killing
it
god
creates
us
to
be
his
loving
companions
he
knows
whether
we
are
true
in
our
love
for
him
or
not
and
he
lets
us
know
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
god
cannot
abide
by
sin
by
rejecting
god
a
person
becomes
an
enemy
of
god
one
that
must
be
killed
by
him
note
i
say
that
god
and
god
alone
is
worthy
to
be
judge
jury
and
executioner
we
are
not
called
to
carry
out
such
duties
because
we
are
not
worthy
in
other
words
you
better
do
what
this
god
wants
you
to
do
or
else
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
god
is
god
who
are
we
to
question
the
creator
if
you
doubt
gods
doing
in
certain
situations
do
you
claim
to
know
a
better
solution
would
you
be
playing
the
role
of
god
in
other
words
its
his
game
he
made
the
rules
and
if
you
know
whats
good
for
you
youll
play
his
game
his
way
