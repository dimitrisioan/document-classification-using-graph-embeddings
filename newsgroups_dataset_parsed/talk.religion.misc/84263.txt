ATOMS
REAL
WAS
RE
AFTER
YEARS
BLAH
BLAH
BLAH
PETRI
AND
MATHEW
YOUR
DISCUSION
ON
THE
REALITY
OF
ATOMS
IS
INTERESTING
BUT
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
YOU
ARE
VERGING
ON
THE
QUESTION
IS
ANYTHING
REAL
THAT
IS
SINCE
OBSERVATION
IS
NOT
RELIABLE
HOW
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
ANYTHING
IS
REAL
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
WAS
THE
INTENTION
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
SINCE
YOU
NOW
DEFINEOUT
THE
WORD
REAL
SO
THAT
NOTHING
CAN
MEET
ITS
CRITERIA
JUST
A
THOUGHT
BRIAN
PS
RAINBOWS
AND
SHADOWS
ARE
REAL
THEY
ARE
NOT
OBJECTS
THEY
ARE
PHENOMENON
AN
INTERESTING
QUESTION
WOULD
BE
IF
ATOMS
ARE
OBJECTS
CLASSICAL
OR
PHENOMENON
NEOQUANTUM
OR
WHAT
