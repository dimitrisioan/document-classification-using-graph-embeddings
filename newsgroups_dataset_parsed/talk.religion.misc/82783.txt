RE
QUESTION
FOR
THOSE
WITH
POPULAR
MORALITY
HUDSON
YES
YOU
DO
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
IMMORAL
FOR
ONESSELF
TO
EXPERIENCE
PAIN
OR
TO
BE
HURT
IN
SOME
OTHER
WAY
MAYBE
UNPLEASANT
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
MORALITY
IT
VIOLATES
FREE
WILL
HUDSON
ME
YOU
CAN
DERIVE
THE
IMMORALITY
OF
HURTING
SOMEONE
ELSE
ENTIRELY
FROM
SELFISH
MOTIVES
I
CAN
SAY
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
IT
IS
WRONG
TO
HURT
OTHER
PEOPLE
BECAUSE
THAT
MAKES
THEM
LESS
PRODUCTIVE
MEMBERS
OF
SOCIETY
HUDSON
WHY
IS
MAKING
SOMEONE
A
LESS
PRODUCTIVE
MEMBER
OF
SOCIETY
IMMORAL
HUDSON
YOU
ARE
SCREWING
UP
AGAIN
MORALITY
DOES
NOT
I
SAY
AGAIN
DOES
NOT
DEFINE
ONLY
RIGHT
AND
WRONG
IT
ALSO
DEFINES
ACCEPTABLE
SOCIAL
BEHAVIOR
WITHOUT
ANY
OVERTONES
OF
GOOD
AND
EVIL
PICKING
UP
YOUR
TRASH
IS
NOT
REALLY
A
RIGHTWRONG
MORAL
ISSUE
IN
THE
ETERNAL
SENSE
OF
GOOD
AND
EVIL
YET
IT
IS
MORAL
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
IT
IS
ACCEPTABLE
SOCIAL
BEHAVIOR
YOUR
DEFINITION
OF
THE
WORD
MORALITY
IS
WHAT
IS
CAUSING
YOU
TO
TRIP
OVER
YOURSELF
HERE
ME
AND
SINCE
I
SELFISH
BEING
THAT
I
AM
WANT
TO
MAXIMIZE
MY
GAINS
FROM
SOCIETY
I
WILL
NOT
DO
ANYTHING
TO
ANOTHER
MEMBER
OF
SOCIETY
IF
THAT
ACTION
MIGHT
CUT
DOWN
ON
HOW
MUCH
BENEFIT
I
CAN
DERIVE
FROM
SOCIETY
HUDSON
WHY
IS
YOUR
BENEFIT
SOMEHOW
RELATED
TO
MORALITY
AGAIN
YOUR
DEFINITION
IS
CAUSING
YOU
TO
SHOOT
YOURSELF
IN
THE
FOOT
HUDSON
WHAT
ABOUT
IF
SOMEONE
FEELS
THAT
THEIR
OWN
PERSONAL
BENEFIT
IS
ENHANCED
MORE
THAN
IT
WOULD
BE
DAMAGED
BY
DEPLETING
THE
OVERALL
RESOURCES
OF
SOCIETY
MAYBE
SOMETHING
MIGHT
HURT
SOCIETY
BUT
IT
WOULD
HELP
HIM
IMMENSLY
THAT
IS
IRRATIONAL
THINKING
THERE
MAY
ALSO
BE
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
WHO
THINK
THAT
DEATH
BY
ATOMIC
DESTRUCTION
IS
A
SUBLIME
AND
WONDERFUL
THING
I
AM
NOT
GOING
TO
LET
THEM
EXECUTE
THAT
IDEA
JUST
BECAUSE
THEY
WANT
TO
DO
IT
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
I
LET
PEOPLE
MAKE
UP
THEIR
MINDS
ABOUT
WHAT
MORALS
THEY
HAVE
DOESNT
PREVENT
ME
FROM
SPOTTING
AND
STOPPING
A
MADMAN
WHEN
I
SEE
ONE
HUDSON
AND
EVEN
THEN
I
WILL
ONLY
STOP
HIM
WHEN
HE
INTERFERES
WITH
ME
AND
MY
LIFE
THAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
ME
AND
YOU
YOU
WANT
TO
INTERFERE
IN
PEOPLES
LIVES
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
ARENT
AFFECTING
YOU
HUDSON
THE
CENTRAL
CHARACTER
IN
DOSTOEVSKYS
NOVEL

AND

R
SOMETHING
OR
OTHER
REASONED
THAT
IF
KILLED
THIS
OLD
JEWISH
WOMAN
AND
STOLE
HER
MONEY
TO
EDUCATE
AND
ESTABLISH
HIMSELF
FINANCIALLY
HE
COULD
MAKE
A
GREAT
CONTRIBUTION
TO
SOCIETY
HE
REASONED
THAT
SHE
WAS
NOT
OF
MUCH
PROFIT
TO
SOCIETY
SHE
JUST
COLLECTED
RENTS
AND
HOARDED
MONEY
ONE
OF
THE
CENTRAL
POINTS
OF
ANY
THATS
ANY
MORAL
SYSTEM
IS
THAT
IS
HAS
TO
BE
INTERNALLY
CONSISTENT
BY
KILLING
HER
THE
CHARACTER
HAD
TO
ACCEPT
THE
PREMISE
THAT
THE
ENDS
JUSTIFY
THE
MEANS
IF
HE
ACCEPTED
THAT
PREMISE
THEN
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
CONSISTENT
HE
MUST
ACCEPT
THE
IDEA
THAT
SOME
DAY
ANOTHER
PERSON
MAY
APPLY
THE
SAME
STANDARD
TO
HIS
LIFE
NOW
IF
HE
IS
UNWILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THIS
PREMISE
WHICH
HE
WILL
NOT
BE
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THEN
HE
HAS
BEHAVED
INCONSISTENTLY
WITH
HIS
OWN
MORAL
STANDARD
ME
FOOTBALL
EXAMPLE
DELETED
HUDSON
NOW
SUPPOSE
A
FRESHMAN
ON
THE
BENCH
WILL
ONLY
GET
TO
PLAY
IF
ONE
OF
THE
PLAYERS
IN
THE
FIELDON
THE
COURT
IS
INJURED
OR
KILLED
THIS
FRESHMAN
WANTS
TO
PLAY
IN
THE
BIG
GAME
SO
A
TALENT
SCOUT
CAN
SEE
HIM
IF
HE
HURTS
A
PLAYER
ON
THE
TEAM
IT
MIGHT
SLIGHTLY
LESSEN
THE
CHANCES
OF
THE
TEAM
TO
WIN
BUT
HE
MIGHT
GAIN
GREAT
PERSONAL
BENEFIT
SO
OPERATING
ON
PURELY
SELFISH
IMMORALLY
SELFISH
MOTIVES
HE
ARRANGES
FOR
A
SNIPER
TO
SHOOT
A
TEAM
PLAYER
IN
THE
LEG
HE
GETS
TO
PLAY
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
TALENT
SCOUT
DID
THAT
FRESHMAN
BEHAVE
MORALLY
SELFISH
INTENTIONS
MAY
SOMETIMES
GENERATE
APPARENTLY
MORAL
ACTIONS
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
TWO
PROBLEMS
RIGHT
OFF
THE
BAT
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
YOUR
ANALOGY
IS
THAT
IT
DOESNT
ADDRESS
THE
GOAL
THAT
I
STARTED
WITH
WINNING
THE
GAME
PLAYING
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
TALENT
SCOUT
WINNING
THE
GAME
TRY
CREATING
THE
SAME
ANALOGY
AND
KEEP
THE
ULTIMATE
GOAL
THE
SAME
WILL
YOU
THE
INTERNAL
CONSISTENCY
QUESTION
IS
ALSO
NOT
ADDRESSED
IF
THE
FRESHMAN
WANTS
TO
DO
THIS
TO
OTHER
PEOPLE
THEN
HE
HAS
TO
ACCEPT
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
MAY
HAPPEN
TO
HIM
ONE
DAY
IF
HE
IS
UNWILLING
THEN
HE
HAS
VIOLATED
HIS
OWN
MORAL
STANDARD
