RE
AFTER
YEARS
CAN
WE
SAY
THAT
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY
IS
IN
ARTICLE
FRANK
ODWYER
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
LIVESEYSOLNTZEWPDSGICOM
JON
LIVESEY
WRITES
THIS
IS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
SAYING
EMPLOYING
FORCE
ON
OTHER
PEOPLE
IS
IMMORAL
PERIOD
UNFORTUNATELY
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
WE
ARE
OBLIGED
TO
DO
THIS
IMMORAL
THING
FOR
REASONS
OF
SELFPRESERVATION
AND
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
BEAR
THE
MORAL
CONSEQUENCES
OF
THAT
SINCE
BOTH
STATEMENTS
TO
ALL
INTENTS
AND
PURPOSES
SAY
EFFECTIVELY
THE
SAME
THING
ARE
YOU
SERIOUS
TWO
STATEMENTS
ONE
OF
WHICH
SAYS
THAT
USE
OF
FORCE
IN
THE
GIVEN
SITUATION
IS
MORAL
AND
THE
OTHER
OF
WHICH
SAYS
IT
IS
NOT
MORAL
SAY
EFFECTIVELY
THE
SAME
THING
YES
WHEN
YOU
TAG
ON
THE
UNFORTUNATELY
THEN
TO
ALL
INTENTS
AND
PURPOSES
YOU
ARE
SAYING
THE
SAME
THING
THEN
DELETE
THE
UNFORTUNATELY
NOW
TELL
ME
THAT
THE
TWO
STATEMENT
SAY
EFFECTIVELY
THE
SAME
THING
AND
TO
SAVE
EVERYONE
A
COUPLE
OF
TRIPS
ROUND
THIS
LOOP
PLEASE
NOTICE
THAT
WE
ARE
ONLY
OBLIGED
TO
USE
FORCE
TO
PRESERVE
SELF
WE
CAN
CHOOSE
NOT
TO
PRESERVE
SELF
WHICH
IS
THE
POINT
OF
PACIFISM
WOULD
YOU
SAY
THIS
OF
ANY
TWO
STATEMENTS
ONE
SAYING
X
IS
MORAL
AND
THE
OTHER
SAYING
X
IS
IMMORAL
HOW
WOULD
YOU
DECIDED
WHEN
TWO
STATEMENTS
X
IS
MORAL
X
IS
IMMORAL
ACTUALLY
CONFLICT
AND
WHEN
THEY
SAY
EFFECTIVELY
THE
SAME
THING
WHAT
THEY
PRESCRIBE
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
DO
IS
A
PRETTY
GOOD
INDICATOR
AND
IN
THIS
CASE
THEY
DONT
PRESCRIBE
THE
SAME
THINGS
SO
AND
LEAD
ONE
TO
DO
PRECISELY
THE
SAME
THING
THEN
EITHER
BOTH
STATEMENTS
ARE
DOUBLESPEAK
OR
NONE
THEY
MIGHT
LEAD
YOU
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THING
BUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
WHAT
MOTIVATES
PACIFISM
SO
THEY
OBVIOUSLY
DONT
LEAD
PACIFISTS
TO
TO
THE
SAME
THING
THATS
NOT
TRUE
YOU
COULD
FORMULATE
A
PRAGMATIC
BELIEF
IN
MINIMUM
FORCE
AND
STILL
BE
A
PACIFIST
IF
THE
MINIMUM
IS
GREAT
BUT
ONE
IS
ALWAYS
TRYING
TO
GET
AS
CLOSE
TO
FORCE
AS
POSSIBLE
UNDER
THAT
BELIEF
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
FORCE
IS
IMMORAL
PERIOD
BUT
STILL
TENDING
TO
PACIFISM
IF
YOU
DONT
THINK
THE
USE
OF
FORCE
IS
IMMORAL
WHY
MINIMISE
ITS
USE
