TO
ROB
LANPHIER
DEAR
ROB
WHEN
I
READ
BRIAN
KS
POSTINGS
I
FIND
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
HONESTLY
SEEKING
THE
TRUTH
WHEN
I
READ
YOUR
RESPONSE
HERE
I
SEE
CONDESCENSION
WHEN
YOU
REPLY
TO
A
POST
REPLY
TO
THE
POST
YOU
QUOTE
THIS
STATEMENT
UNDERMINES
ANY
GOOD
POINTS
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
HAD
IT
WAS
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
ME
STOP
READING
SOMETIMES
I
DO
COME
ACROSS
CONDESENDING
AND
I
AM
SORRY
I
COME
ACROSS
THAT
WAY
AT
TIMES
THANK
YOU
FOR
THE
REPROACH
I
REALLY
DO
APPRECIATE
IT
ILL
TRY
TO
GET
BETTER
ROB
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
HAVE
ALSO
LEARNED
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
RESPOND
TO
THE
GENTLE
APPROACH
WHILE
OTHERS
RESPOND
ONLY
AT
A
HARSH
REBUKE
BRIAN
K
SO
FAR
ONLY
RESPONDS
TO
THE
LATTER
AND
I
AM
GLAD
HE
RESPONDS
AT
ALL
IN
BOTH
CASES
OF
APPROACH
MY
INTENTION
IS
TO
BE
LOVING
I
AM
MAKING
NO
EXCUSE
FOR
MYSELF
IF
I
AM
COMING
ACROSS
CONDESENDING
I
APOLOGIZE
FOR
THAT
ROB
SOMETIMES
BRIAN
K
COMES
ACROSS
AS
HONEST
I
KNOW
THIS
BUT
BRIAN
K
VASILLATES
BACK
AND
FORTH
ONE
POST
LOOKS
HONEST
THE
NEXT
IS
AN
EXCUSE
NOW
HE
WANTS
ME
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
UNIVERSE
IN
WORDS
OR
LESS
I
THINK
BRIAN
KENDIG
IS
REALLY
TRYING
BUT
HE
IS
TOO
COMFORTABLE
WITH
HIS
SET
OF
EXCUSES
I
JUST
WANT
BRIAN
K
TO
BE
HONEST
WITH
HIMSELF
IF
HE
REALLY
WANTS
TO
KNOW
HE
WILL
ASK
QUESTIONS
AND
STOP
ASSERTING
IRRELEVANT
EXCUSES
WHICH
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
MY
GOD
I
WISH
BRIAN
WOULD
READ
THE
BIBLE
FOR
HIMSELF
AND
COME
TO
HIS
OWN
DECISIONS
WITHOUT
BEING
SIDETRACKED
WITH
THE
TEMPTATION
TO
MOCK
GOD
FROM
MY
PERSPECTIVE
ROB
WHEN
I
LOOK
AT
BRIAN
KENDIG
I
SEE
A
MAN
STANDING
OUT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
HIGHWAY
OFF
INTO
THE
DISTANCE
I
SEE
A
MACK
TRUCK
HEADING
RIGHT
FOR
HIM
BUT
BRIAN
K
IS
FACED
AWAY
FROM
THE
ONCOMING
TRUCK
HE
DOESNT
SEE
IT
HERES
IS
HOW
I
SEE
THE
DIALOG
ME
BRIAN
K
PLEASE
STEP
ASIDE
BEFORE
YOU
GET
RUN
OVER
BK
THERE
IS
NO
TRUCK
ME
TURN
AROUND
AT
LOOK
BK
NO
ME
LOOK
YOU
WILL
BE
HEALTHIER
IF
YOU
DO
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
ONCOMING
TRUCK
BK
NO
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
WHY
TRUCKS
EXIST
ME
TURN
AROUND
OR
YOU
WILL
RUN
OVER
BK
NO
I
WONT
BECAUSE
I
LIKE
HIKING
AND
TOMORROW
IS
TUESDAY
ME
YOU
BLIND
FOOL
WHY
DO
YOU
CHOOSE
IGNORANCE
YOU
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
LOSE
IF
YOU
LOOK
BUT
IF
DO
NOT
LOOK
YOU
WILL
CERTAINLY
LOSE
YOUR
LIFE
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
SEE
YOU
SQUASHED
ALL
OVER
THE
ROAD
BK
IT
IS
MY
LIFE
TO
LOSE
I
RATHER
NOT
LOOK
BESIDES
A
TRUCK
RUNNING
OVER
ME
WILL
NOT
HARM
ME
AND
BY
THE
WAY
I
REALLY
HAVE
AN
OPEN
MIND
SO
IS
MY
MOTIVATION
TO
BELITTLE
BRIAN
OR
TO
LOVE
BRIAN
THE
BEST
I
KNOW
HOW
I
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
SINGLE
BRIAN
KENDIG
OUT
BECAUSE
MILLIONS
IF
NOT
BILLIONS
OF
PEOPLE
FALL
INTO
THE
SAME
CATEGORY
PERHAPS
ALL
PEOPLE
FALL
HAVE
FALLEN
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
AT
ONE
TIME
IN
THEIR
LIVES
I
HAVE
I
CAN
NOW
SEE
THE
TRUCK
BEHIND
BRIAN
MY
HOPE
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
LOOK
AND
WILL
SEE
THE
RAMIFICATIONS
OF
THE
TRUCK
COMING
TOWARDS
HIM
MY
HOPE
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
WANT
TO
STEP
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
MY
FEAR
THOUGH
IS
THAT
BRIAN
WILL
INSTEAD
CHOOSE
TO
GLUE
HIMSELF
TO
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
HIGHWAY
WHERE
HE
WILL
CERTAINLY
GET
RUN
OVER
BUT
IF
HE
SO
CHOOSES
HE
SO
CHOOSES
AND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
I
CAN
DO
BEYOND
THAT
TO
CHANGE
HIS
MIND
FOR
IT
IS
HIS
CHOICE
BUT
AT
THIS
VERY
MOMENT
BRIAN
HASNT
GOTTEN
EVEN
THAT
FAR
HE
IS
STILL
AT
THE
POINT
WHERE
HE
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
LOOK
SURE
HE
MOVES
HIS
EYEBALL
TO
APPEASE
ME
BUT
HIS
HEAD
WILL
NOT
TURN
AROUND
TO
SEE
THE
ENTIRE
PICTURE
SO
FAR
HE
IS
SATISFIED
WITH
HIS
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
MOUNTAINS
OFF
IN
THE
DISTANCE
THANK
YOU
AGAIN
ROB
FOR
YOUR
REPROACH
I
REALLY
DO
APPRECIATE
IT
MY
WIFE
TELLS
ME
THE
SAME
THING
AT
TIMES
I
WILL
TRY
TO
DO
BETTER
