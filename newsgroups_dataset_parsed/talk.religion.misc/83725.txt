ARTICLE
TONY
ALICEA
WRITES
WITH
THE
SOUTHERN
BAPTIST
CONVENTION
CONVENING
THIS
JUNE
TO
CONSIDER
THE
CHARGES
THAT
FREEMASONRY
IS
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
THOUGHT
THE
FOLLOWING
QUOTES
BY
MR
JAMES
HOLLY
THE
ANTIMASONIC
FLAG
CARRIER
WOULD
AMUSE
YOU
ALL
MUNCH
I
HOPE
YOU
ALL
HAD
A
GOOD
LAUGH
I
KNOW
I
DID
G
IT
WOULD
BE
FUNNY
IF
IT
WASNT
SO
DAMN
NASTY
AND
AS
NONXIAN
AS
I
AM
ITS
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
PUSHING
BLACK
IS
WHITE
AND
FREEDOM
IS
SLAVERY
SO
BLATANTLY
MARK
