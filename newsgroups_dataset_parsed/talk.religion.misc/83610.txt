these
laws
written
for
the
israelites
gods
chosen
people
whom
god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
jews
wont
agree
with
you
