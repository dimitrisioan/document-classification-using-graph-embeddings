presumably
this
means
that
some
moral
systems
are
better
than
others
how
so
how
do
you
manage
this
without
an
objective
frame
of
reference
which
goes
faster
a
bullet
or
a
snail
how
come
you
can
answer
that
when
einstein
proved
that
there
isnt
an
objective
frame
of
reference
not
that
einstein
proved
anything
oh
yes
he
did
you
may
not
agree
with
his
premises
and
what
he
proved
may
not
apply
to
reality
if
such
a
thing
exists
but
he
certainly
proved
something
but
you
cant
answer
it
and
your
answer
be
in
general
true
got
it
in
one
similarly
a
moral
relativist
will
not
judge
one
moral
system
to
be
better
than
another
in
every
possible
circumstance
this
does
not
however
preclude
him
from
judging
one
moral
system
to
be
better
than
another
in
a
specific
set
of
circumstances
nor
does
it
preclude
a
set
of
moral
relativists
from
collectively
judging
a
moral
system
from
some
set
of
circumstances
which
they
all
agree
they
are
in
and
even
that
statement
assumes
an
objective
reality
independent
of
our
beliefs
about
it
eh
could
you
explain
this
which
that
statement
are
you
talking
about
and
what
weasel
word
do
you
use
to
describe
that
frame
of
reference
if
it
isnt
an
objective
reality
for
values
im
sorry
i
cant
parse
an
objective
reality
for
values
could
you
try
again
san
objective
reality
for
valuessome
values
are
real
even
in
the
face
of
disagreement
i
still
dont
quite
see
what
youre
trying
to
say
i
assume
by
values
you
mean
moral
values
yes
in
which
case
what
do
you
mean
by
real
what
is
a
real
moral
value
as
opposed
to
an
unreal
one
if
you
are
saying
that
some
moral
systems
are
better
than
others
in
your
opinion
then
all
you
get
is
infinite
regress
sorry
but
in
what
way
is
it
an
infinite
regress
it
looks
extremely
finite
to
me
what
you
do
not
get
is
any
justification
for
saying
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
sorry
but
thats
not
so
i
can
provide
a
justification
for
asserting
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
i
just
cant
provide
a
justification
which
works
in
all
possible
circumstances
similarly
i
can
provide
a
justification
for
asserting
that
bullets
move
faster
than
snails
that
justification
wont
hold
in
all
possible
frames
of
reference
but
it
will
hold
in
almost
all
the
frames
of
reference
i
am
ever
likely
to
be
in
your
saying
it
does
not
make
it
so
and
thats
according
to
your
premise
not
mine
i
dont
think
i
agree
with
this
my
saying
it
does
make
it
so
from
my
point
of
view
and
according
to
my
premises
unless
the
argument
is
invalid
it
may
indeed
not
make
it
so
from
your
point
of
view
but
i
never
claimed
that
it
did
in
fact
i
dont
even
claim
that
you
exist
enough
to
have
a
point
of
view
