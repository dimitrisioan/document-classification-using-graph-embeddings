who
would
be
alive
today
if
they
had
been
released
back
when
we
were
the
word
released
is
loaded
until
convicted
in
cxourt
my
children
are
my
own
when
the
feds
use
this
type
of
loaded
logic
you
cannot
win
we
accuse
you
we
shoot
a
couple
of
your
kids
we
blame
you
for
those
shots
we
harrass
you
for
days
we
tell
you
to
come
out
or
die
we
gas
you
you
burn
to
death
we
blame
you
prior
to
trial
for
all
of
it
