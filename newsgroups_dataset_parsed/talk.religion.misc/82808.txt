question
i
dont
have
a
nice
concise
answer
though
what
about
the

are
crushed
emotionally
because
heshe
starts
a
carerr
doing
something
they
greatly
dislike
it
is
the
same
kind
of
harm
and
is
probably
caused
by
the
same
thing
the
desire
of
the
child
to
be
true
to
his
or
her
self
what
is
more
important
being
true
to
yourself

burying
that
truth
within
you
in
order
to
maintain
peace
in
the
family
