writes
i
learned
that
god
loves
his
children
who
have
never
heard
of
him
and
has
a
plan
for
redeeming
them
too
even
those
who
have
died
without
a
knowledge
of
christ
i
learned
that
a
man
cannot
frustrate
justice
by
repenting
on
his
death
bed
because
repentance
is
more
than
a
feeling
of
remorse
it
requires
faith
in
christ
proven
by
following
him
by
keeping
his
commandments
such
cannot
be
accomplished
on
ones
deathbed
so
jesus
must
have
lied
to
the
thief
on
the
cross
paradise
and
salvation
are
not
the
same
thing
salvation
is
better
