eric

writes
at
my
high
school
for
instance
our
dear
principal
ended
the
moment
of
silence
with
amen
an
extremely
good
example
of
circumstantial
evidence
every
time
these
rightwing
controlfreaks
start
spouting
about
prayer
in
schools
i
get
this
nagging
commentary
from
the
sermon
on
the
mount
matt
and
when
you
pray
do
not
imitate
the
hypocrites
they
love
to
say
their
prayers
standing
up
in
the
synagogues
and
at
the
street
corners
for
people
to
see
them
i
tell
you
solemnly
they
have
had
their
reward
but
when
you
pray
go
to
your
private
room
and
when
you
have
shut
your
door
pray
to
your
father
who
is
in
that
secret
place
but
no
they
want
public
prayers
the
better
to
manipulate
children
amen
indeed
when
the
proschoolprayer
types
stop
trying
to
sneak
religion
in
ill
stop
opposing
everything
that
even
looks
remotely
like
religion
thank
you
i
hope
you
dont
mind
if
i
say
amen
to
this
michael
l
siemon
i
say
you
are
gods
sons
of
the
mlspanixcom
most
high
all
of
you
nevertheless
or
you
shall
die
like
men
and
fall
