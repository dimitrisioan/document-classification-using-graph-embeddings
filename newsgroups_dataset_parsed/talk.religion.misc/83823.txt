so
are
you
happy
now
when
people
including
innocent
kids
died
today
its
amazing
how
everyone
automatically
blames
one
side
or
the
other
one
thing
for
sure
koresh
will
have
no
chance
to
defend
himself
against
the
statements
lacking
in
fact
or
court
sponsored
verification
made
by
agents
who
participated
in
the
situation
that
killed
him
i
dont
know
they
murdered
him
i
also
dont
know
that
the
branch
davidians
set
a
fire
and
suicidede
it
is
sick
of
batf
or
fbi
spokepeople
to
make
such
comments
in
advance
of
forensic
pathology
stephen
thank
you
god
speed
no
kinda
numb
i
thought
something
like
this
was
going
to
happen
over
a
week
ago
one
of
the
things
thats
been
obvious
from
the
yah
start
is
that
when
there
are
two
armed
camps
neither
of
which
yields
its
usually
get
slaughtered
when
any
little
spark
sets
it
off
which
is
why
koresh
and
company
shouldnt
have
stockpiled
weapons
and
why
the
batf
shouldnt
have
come
primed
for
a
raid
bingo
am
i
the
only
one
to
notice
a
no
peaceful
attempt
to
serve
a
warrant
b
six
months
to
develop
a
scene
and
six
days
to
end
it
c
ah
god
children
at
least
adults
plus
at
the
beginning
and
more
batf
agents
all
dead
painful
point
if
the
davidians
fired
first
why
were
the
batf
on
the
roof
rather
than
taking
cover
has
anyone
asked
themselves
these
questions
have
you
seen
the
entire
video
sequences
taken
during
the
opening
rounds
i
seem
to
recall
missing
several
key
parts
a
the
first
five
minutes
of
day
one
only
the
shooting
part
comes
out
b
what
happened
to
the
feds
video
units
you
mean
they
do
not
carry
helmet
cams
wonder
why
not
how
is
it
you
can
have
camera
crews
with
live
transmission
video
present
and
not
have
an
uninterrupted
record
a
you
realize
the
units
carry
ittle
bitty
backups
that
hold
minutes
per
unit
and
there
are
twounits
on
the
professional
handhelds
so
no
tape
turnover
gaps
b
until
all
views
are
seen
it
is
premature
to
point
fingers
in
either
direction
as
you
well
point
out
stephen
anyone
batf
bd
xbd
other
could
have
touched
it
off
by
mistake
or
maliciously
more
on
this
below
once
koresh
was
shot
disregarding
his
being
a
religious
leader
and
apocalyptically
obsessed
most
likely
the
people
inside
just
went
on
drill
just
like
the
batf
outside
is
the
lesson
that
automatic
responses
are
very
hazardous
last
resort
measures
yes
but
it
is
so
hard
toremain
human
under
the
full
pressure
of
hazard
game
playing
and
life
painful
point
either
side
could
have
backed
off
to
help
defuse
the
situation
we
see
the
problem
constantly
here
on
the
net
with
flaming
ego
problems
nuff
said
more
to
the
point
when
someone
dies
almost
like
it
was
intended
that
way
both
sides
will
kill
to
maintain
their
innocence
a
contradiction
in
terms
painful
point
it
doesnt
help
to
take
sides
in
such
a
situation
just
adds
fuel
to
the
fire
better
is
to
let
it
burn
out
on
its
own
true
usually
i
pick
the
unpopular
side
and
point
out
from
the
evidence
seen
what
might
have
alternatively
happened
best
example
i
can
think
of
is
christ
with
the
tax
coin
he
didnt
have
one
and
so
didnt
sanction
the
roman
authority
unduly
when
they
showed
it
to
him
he
noted
that
it
was
caesars
minting
and
so
said
give
it
to
him
no
waste
of
time
and
then
he
got
back
to
more
worthwhile
concerns
gods
will
this
requires
someone
interested
in
gods
will
please
note
that
the
outstanding
overt
problem
in
this
country
today
is
one
where
the
government
wants
caesars
coin
to
pay
off
the
debt
the
antitax
movement
of
today
and
the
antissanasid
groups
would
do
well
to
note
who
the
issuing
authority
is
ditto
for
those
yes
the
american
people
not
the
federal
government
and
if
it
is
not
spent
towards
that
end
noone
deserves
the
coin
made
in
the
image
of
god
yah
fewpeople
hear
the
contradiction
money
made
in
the
image
of
god
no
need
to
stir
things
up
in
ever
larger
revorevorevolution
as
governments
turn
over
and
over
and
over
i
wish
you
were
wrong
many
pundits
are
saying
years
the
onyl
good
thing
to
come
out
of
my
divorce
and
my
exposure
to
the
damned
pardon
me
american
divorce
attorney
is
i
have
no
money
left
to
lose
to
taxes
or
inflation
painful
point
for
many
this
was
just
entertainment
thumbsup
thumbsdown
just
another
thriller
like
terminator
or
a
goodold
ball
game
is
the
lesson
that
weve
become
jaded
to
media
reality
children
dead
if
anyone
thinks
blaming
koresh
or
the
batf
helps
this
any
at
all
is
sick
and
wrong
the
reason
you
can
tell
that
the
batf
may
not
be
entirely
straight
on
this
is
that
the
leaders
at
press
conferences
havew
made
any
comments
about
even
the
possibility
that
koresh
or
his
followers
caused
this
the
batf
agentss
are
more
concerned
with
their
repuations
and
morals
not
my
fault
koresh
did
it
than
they
are
with
dead
children
same
goes
for
koresh
his
followers
who
are
all
mostly
dead
painful
point
la
burned
the
davidians
burned
in
one
case
society
has
abandoned
the
people
which
has
returned
to
a
frontier
in
the
other
the
outskirts
were
bumping
against
the
suburbs
is
the
lesson
that
whats
lawful
in
different
areas
of
society
depends
more
on
conditions
than
laws
more
on
power
and
favoritism
my
personal
opinion
look
to
history
whenever
privilege
has
replaced
whatever
token
of
objective
law
and
justice
a
society
has
had
hitlerrs
have
followed
if
we
dont
learnthelessons
or
at
least
make
an
honest
effort
the
next
conflagration
will
no
doubt
be
closer
to
home
rather
than
putting
out
fires
arent
there
much
more
important
concerns
for
us
to
work
on
you
do
your
name
sake
proud
stephen
its
hard
but
please
keep
on
keeping
on
each
voice
in
the
wilderness
now
will
save
a
generation
unborn
from
horror
kent
who
cant
cheers
today
exactly
what
keeps
me
from
being
a
bombthrower
is
my
loving
god
as
irra
tional
as
that
is
for
so
many
one
direct
benefit
is
being
able
to
keep
things
in
perspective
ks
the
day
i
need
a
gun
or
abomb
to
protect
myself
in
this
society
is
the
day
that
society
is
already
beyond
redemption
and
that
aint
redundant
if
you
have
any
christian
belief
aytall
and
the
day
that
i
cannot
peacefully
enjoin
others
in
the
act
that
thoreau
called
civil
disobedience
to
rectify
the
wrongs
that
my
society
practises
without
undue
harm
or
punishment
befalling
me
is
the
day
that
society
has
ceased
to
be
a
human
society
and
become
a
society
of
animals
we
are
very
cclose
to
that
such
as
who
hurts
more
the
ones
who
died
or
the
loved
ones
who
are
left
besides
the
lessons
its
also
time
for
many
to
grieve
including
those
whove
lost
their
faith
in
others
or
in
god
im
learning
to
be
patient
and
let
things
heal
god
willing
six
years
fighting
an
unjust
court
issue
still
struggling
to
be
patient
for
those
who
like
contrary
questions
nb
i
was
not
there
i
am
not
a
branch
davidian
nor
a
law
official
hater
i
do
hate
liars
or
the
six
letter
variety
of
same
the
official
side
has
its
advocates
already
lets
balance
the
equation
and
asj
a
few
questions
on
the
other
side
for
the
sake
of
an
old
saw
the
batf
abd
fbi
seem
to
want
to
bypass
innocent
until
proven
guilty
not
innocent
until
presumed
guilty
where
are
the
video
tapes
from
the
tanks
all
of
them
dont
tell
me
they
do
not
exist
they
are
standard
equipment
so
you
think
koresh
fired
the
place
because
of
the
explosion
a
tear
gas
comes
with
an
aerosol
to
spread
it
this
aerosol
is
deliberately
made
to
be
as
nonflammable
as
possible
it
is
as
nonflammable
as
possible
gotcha
when
in
isolation
from
other
substances
why
was
a
pipe
deliveryu
system
used
rather
than
remote
launchers
why
did
the
fbi
not
announce
this
window
blown
in
plus
tear
gas
five
minutes
then
the
wall
come
down
and
maintain
a
left
to
right
sequence
b
most
aerosols
also
have
a
secondary
compound
that
when
mixed
in
becomes
a
very
flammable
and
difficult
to
trace
suspension
with
a
very
special
property
exposure
to
brief
eruptions
of
high
heat
muzzle
blasts
or
long
exposure
to
low
heat
matches
a
stove
will
not
tend
to
ignite
what
other
chemicals
come
up
in
the
forensics
who
else
will
be
allowed
to
test
the
site
c
after
a
few
minutes
to
hours
ifdesired
the
combnation
rate
can
be
controlled
as
desired
the
mixture
can
be
made
to
become
veryignitable
onb
exposure
to
a
temperature
above
a
certain
point
a
tracer
round
for
a
certain
heat
quantity
a
small
explosive
charge
or
for
a
length
of
time
start
a
wall
fire
and
wait
check
your
military
records
look
at
the
tapes
why
were
tanks
large
capacity
delivey
systems
tear
gas
why
not
somnorifics
and
now
why
the
hurry
was
there
still
a
comm
channel
open
to
the
outside
do
you
see
any
trace
of
fire
coming
back
to
the
compound
in
the
videos
all
the
videos
which
ones
are
missing
do
i
sound
paranoid
maybe
am
i
probably
not
you
trust
the
fbi
and
batf
to
render
judgement
in
advance
of
a
court
god
help
us
for
we
are
surely
not
helping
ourselves
you
trut
the
federal
gevernment
to
give
us
a
clean
slate
you
are
trillion
admitted
down
and
counting
look
again
did
it
happen
that
way
i
do
not
know
i
was
not
there
and
it
should
wait
for
a
court
to
decide
but
will
that
happen
people
will
not
have
the
chance
to
tell
their
side
as
the
batf
leader
was
on
camera
no
one
wins
except
more
force
next
time
listen
to
your
hearts
