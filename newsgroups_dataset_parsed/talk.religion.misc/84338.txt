MR
CLINTON
SAID
TODAY
THAT
THE
HORRIBLE
TRAGEDY
OF
THE
WACO
FIASCO
SHOULD
REMIND
THOSE
WHO
JOIN
CULTS
OF
THE
DANGERS
OF
DOING
SO
NOW
I
BEGAN
SCRATCHING
MY
HEAD
THINKING
A
BAD
SIGN
DONT
THE
MAINSTREAM
RELIGIONS
IN
THIS
CASE
CHRISTIANITYOR

ADVENTIST

JUST

THESE

GOING
ISNT
MR
CLINTON
CONDEMNING
HIS
OWN
RELIGION
AFTER
ALL
ISNT
IT
A
CULT
TOO
BAD
THOUGHTS
THESE
WELL
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHETHER

CULT
WHICH
ALLOWS

MAINSTREAM
RELIGIONS
AS
SOCIALLYACCEPTABLE
AND

AS

AND
ALL
THE
OTHER
CHARACTERISTICS
THAT
DEFINE
OPPRESSIVE
PROBLY
NOT
THE
BEST
WORD
CULT
BEHAVIOUR
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
ACADEMIC
USE
OF
THE
WORD
CULT
IS
THAT
IT
IS
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
ORIENTED
AROUND
A
SINGLE
AUTHORITY
FIGURE
IT
NEED
NOT
BE
RELIGIOUS
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
SEEN
PLENTY
OF
RELIGIOUS
CULTS
INCLUDING
SOME
THAT
MAINSTREAM
