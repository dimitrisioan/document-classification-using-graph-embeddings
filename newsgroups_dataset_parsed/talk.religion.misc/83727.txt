response
yes
very
true
the
entire
title
is
the
ancient
and
mystical
order
rosae
crucis
they
are
located
at
naglee

san

california
usa
they
are
considered
different
and
largely
unrelated
by
a
number
of
sources
ive
seen
documentation
which
links
them
through
the
figure
of
h
spencer
lewis
lewis
was
apparently
involved
with
reuss
who
was
the
oho
of
ordo
templi
orientis
for
many
years
apparently
it
is
also
true
that
lewis
had
a
charter
to
form
an
oto
body
and
then
created
amorc
as
a
subsidiary
an
interesting
question

headquarters
in
san

a
pretty
decent
metaphysical

any
of

are
interested
in
such
books

my
son
loves
to
run
around
in
their
