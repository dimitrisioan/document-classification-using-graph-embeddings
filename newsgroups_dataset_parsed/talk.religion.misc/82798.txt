LEIFSON
WRITES
DR
ENGLANDS
STORY
DELETED
IT
WAS
A
NICE
READ
THE
FIRST
TIME
THROUGH
NOW
LEAD
THE
CHURCH
I
FOR
ONE
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
BE
LABELLED
CHRISTIAN
IF
THOSE
WHO
PROFESS
THEMSELVES
AS
CHRISTIANS
ATTACK
MY
BELIEFS
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
INTOLLERENT
FOR
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
WAY
MY
RELIGION
MAY
INTERPRET
BIBLICAL
SCRIPTURES
OF
THE
SAME
SOURCE
TO
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
MEANING
AND
IMPLICATION
THAN
MAINSTREAM
CHRISTIANITY
WOULD
GIVE
IT
IT
ISNT
SO
MUCH
A
MATTER
OF
INTERPRETATION
OF
BIBLE
TEXTS
THAT
SETS
MORMONISM
APART
FROM
ORTHODOXY
AS
IT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
FABRICATION
ABOUT
YEARS
AGO
NATIONAL
LAMPOON
HAD
SOME
COMIC
STRIPS
IN
THEM
THAT
WERE
DRAWN
BY
NEAL
ADAMS
THEY
WERE
CALLED
SON
O
GOD
COMICS
IT
WAS
A
PARODY
OF
THE
JESUS
IN
THE
BIBLE
IN
THE
COMIC
THERE
WERE
A
GROUP
OF
THIRTEEN
JEWISH
KIDS
FROM
BROOKLYN
AND
WHEN
ONE
OF
THEM
SAID
THE
MAGIC
WORD
HE
TURNED
INTO
SON
O
GOD
HE
WENT
FROM
A
MYOPIC
CURLY
HEADED
YARMULKE
WEARING
BOY
TO
A
REPLICA
OF
THE
STYLIZIED
PORTRAITS
OF
JESUS
WITH
LONG
FLOWING
BROWN
HAIR
AND
GENTILE
FEATURES
NOW
IF
SOMEONE
WERE
TO
PROFESS
FAITH
IN
THIS
NATLAMP
JESUS
AND
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
WERE
A
CHRISTIAN
BECAUSE
THEY
BELIEVED
IN
THIS
NATLAMP
JESUS
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
WAS
FALLACIOUS
SINCE
THIS
JESUS
WAS
A
FABRICATION
AND
DID
NOT
REALLY
EXIST
THIS
IS
THE
EXACT
SAME
THING
THAT
THE
LDS
DO
WHEN
THEY
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
ARE
CHRISTIAN
THEY
PROFESS
FAITH
IN
JESUS
BUT
THE
JESUS
THAT
THEY
PROFESS
TO
HAVE
FAITH
IN
IS
AS
MUCH
A
FABRICATION
AS
THE
NATLAMP
JESUS
WAS
