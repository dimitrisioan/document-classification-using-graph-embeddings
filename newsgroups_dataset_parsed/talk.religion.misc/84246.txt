CHRISTIANITY
WAS
ALBERT
SABIN
ACTUALLY
IF
MR
X
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
GAIN
BY
HIS
CLAIMS
HIS
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
EVENTS
WOULD
NMOT
BE
THE
MOST
RESPECTED
CASE
AND
POINT
THE
RESURRECTION

CLAIMING
THAT
THE
RESURRECTION
ACTUALLY
HAPPENED
THE
EARLY
PREACHERS
WERE
ABLE
TO
CONVERT
MANY
TO
CHRISTIANITY
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
READ
MATHEW
AND
THE
CASE
FOR
THE
RESURRECTED
SAINTS
WHO
WALKED
AROUND
JERUSALEM
AND
APPEARED
TO
MANY
PEOPLE

WOULD
REALIZE
THAT
OTHER
HISTORIANS
JOSEPHUS
FOR
ONE
WOULD
HAVE
REPORTED
ON
IT
ALL
IF
IT
HAPPENED

THE

SPEAKS
OF
EVENTS
OF
SUCH
GREAT
MAGNITUDE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NOTICED
TAKEN
WITH
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
REPORTED
ON
BY
HISTORIANS
COULD
ONLY
MEAN
THAT
THE
BIBLE
CONTAINS
MANY
MADE
UP
STORIES
