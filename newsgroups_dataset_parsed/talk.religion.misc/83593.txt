ENTIRELY
MISSED
MY
POINT
IN
MY
PREVIOUS
POSTING
IN
WHICH
I
WROTE
FIRMLY
ON
THE
WESTERN
COAST
OF
THE
MED
YOU
CAN
BET
IUM
GONNA
KEEP
THIS
BABY
MY
MY
MY
SUCH
DOUBLE
STANDARDS
YOU
NEGLECTED
TO
GIVE
ANY
PRIMARY
SOURCES
FOR
YOUR
BOOK
ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF
THE
BIBLE
ARE
WE
TO
EXPECT
THAT
SOURCE
TO
BE
AS
UNBIASED
AS
THE
OTHER
SOURCES
MR
BUTLER
DID
GIVE
AT
LEAST
ONE
SOURCE
YOU
HAVE
GIVEN
NONE
REPLY
IT
WAS
A
JOKE
THE
READERS
DIGEST
ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF
THE
BIBLE
WAS
THE
MOST
OUTRAGEOUSLY
BOGUS
AUTHORITY
I
COULD
DREDGE
FROM
MY
SHELVES
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
GOING
TO
SOME
ENCYCLOPEDIA
RATHER
THAN
ORIGINAL
OR
SCHOLARLY
SOURCES
IS
A
BIG
MISTAKE
IN
PROCEDURE
I
AM
GLAD
TO
NOTE
THAT
BUTLER
AND
DECESNO
ARE
ARGUING
ABOUT
SUBSTANCE
NOW
RATHER
THAN
ABOUT
ARGUING
I
GUESS
THE
JOKE
WAS
ON
ME
I
AM
SO
USED
TO
SEEING
BOGUS
STUFF
POSTED
HERE
THAT
I
ASSUMED
THAT

NECESSARILY
