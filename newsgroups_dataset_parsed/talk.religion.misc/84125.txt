THYAGI
MORGOTH
NAGASIVA
WRITES
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ADD
MY
SUPPORT
FOR
A
MISCTAOISM
DISCUSSION
GROUP
I
APPLAUD
THE
ENTHUSIAM
SHOWN
BY
THE
PERSON
POSTING
THYAGICUPPORTALCOM
I
READ
IN
ALTMAGICK
BUT
I
DIFFER
WITH
HIMHER
IN
BELIEVING
THAT
AT
LEAST
SOME
MINIMAL
PARAMETERS
SHOULD
BE
AGREED
UPON
THYAGI
WROTE
I
RECOMMEND
THAT
THE
DEPTH
OF
GENERALITY
INDEED
OF
AMBIGUITY
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
MISCTAOISM
BE
MAXIMIZED
CALLING
THE
TRADITION
OLD
OR
NEW
IS
RATHER
UNNECESSARY
AND
ONLY
LEADS
TO
FOOLISH
SQUABBLES
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
NATURE
IS
A
SPLENDID
TEACHER
WHETHER
SHE
APPEARS
IN
THE
WORDS
SPOKEN
BY
A
TREE
OR
BY
A
STREAM
A
MICROBE
OR
A
STAR
LET
US
NOT
LIMIT
MISCTAOISM
TO
PHILOSOPHY
BUT
IF
WE
DONT
LIMIT
IT
TO
SOMETHING
THE
DISCUSSION
DEGENERATES
INTO
A
BIG
AMORPHOUS
GLOB
OTHER
QUESTIONS
THYAGI
PROPOSES
ARE
WHAT
IS
THIS
ACTUAL
PROCESS
OF
REALITY
WHY
IS
TAOISM
BASED
UPON
AN
ASSUMPTION
WHY
DOES
THIS
ASSUMPTION
CONCERN
KNOWLEDGE
AND
WHAT
CAN
BE
KNOWN
WHAT
IS
THE
VALUE
OF
NOT
KNOWING
WHAT
IS
A
TAO
WHAT
DOES
IT
MEAN
TO
BE
TAOD
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THESE
QUESTIONS
MORE
PROPERLY
FALL
INTO
THE
CATEGORY
OF
GENERAL
METAPHYSICS
I
WOULD
PREFER
ANY
MISCTAOISM
TO
DEAL
MORE
CLOSELY
WITH
TOPICS
AND
WORKS
MORE
CLOSELY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
AT
LEAST
SEMIORTHODOX
TAOISM
WITH
ESTABLISHED
CLASSIC
WORKS
DEFINITELY
INCLUDED
AND
WORKS
LIKE
MANTAK
CHIAS
ARGUED
ABOUT
I
THINK
NEOTAOISM
SHOULD
BE
EXCLUDED
OR
GET
ITS
OWN
GROUP
WHAT
I
MEAN
BY
THIS
IS
HUMPTYDUMPTY
TAOISM
IN
WHICH
TAOISM
MEANS
WHATEVER
A
POSTER
SAYS
IT
MEANS
THIS
ALTTAOISM
COULD
ALSO
BE
A
REFUGE
FOR
DEBATES
ABOUT
WHAT
TAOISM
REALLY
MEANS
OR
SPECULATIONS
ON
SEXUAL
ALCHEMY
ETC
EG
FROM
THYAGI
AGAIN
TAOISM
DOES
WHAT
THE
HELL
IT
WANTS
I
TELL
YOU
TAOISM
DOESNT
EXIST
TAOISM
IS
NO
MORE
REAL
THAT
TAO
DECIDE
NOW
REAL
OR
NOT
REAL
EXIST
OR
NOTEXIST
WHEN
SHALL
WE
BE
CERTAIN
KENT
GLOOMILY
PREDICTS
QUOTING
FROM
THYAGIS
ARTICLE
HOWEVER
MOST
TRAFFIC
IN
THE
GROUP
WILL
LIKELY
CONCERN
THE
PHILOSOPHICAL
SECULAR
TAOISM
AVERRED
BY
ALAN
WATTS
AND
NIELS
BOHR
AND
YOGIC
TAOISM
AS
IT
PERTAINS
TO
MEDICAL
SEXUAL
AND
MARTIAL
TECHNIQUES
I
THINK
THAT
DISCUSSIONS
OF
THIS
NATURE
ARE
NOT
COMPLETELY
OUT
OF
PLACE
WHATS
HAPPENING
IS
THAT
THAT
THE
TERM
TAOISM
IS
BECOMING
COMPLETELY
POLLUTED
AND
TRIVIALIZED
LIKE
THE
WORDS
MAGIC
ALCHEMY
ZEN
ETC
BY
WRITERS
APPROPRIATING
THE
WORD
TO
MEAN
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
THIS
IS
SEEN
BY
THE
SPATE
OF
NEW
AGE
BOOKS
ENTITLED
THE
TAO
OF
THIS
THAT
AND
EVERYTHING
ELSE
WITH
RESPECT
TO
SOME
EXCEPTIONS
LIKE
THE
BOOKS
BY
JOU
TSUNGHWA
ANY
OTHER
COMMENTSIDEAS
I
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
SEEING
THEM
ON
BALANCE
I
SAY
LET
MISCTAOISM
RIP
AND
LET
THE
CHIPS
FALL
WHERE
THEY
MAY
IF
IT
JUST
GETS
FILLED
UP
WITH
COLLEGE
FRESHMEN
ASKING
ABOUT
THE
TAO
OF
SEX
THEN
IT
WILL
HAVE
BEEN
A
FAILURE
AND
PEOPLE
WILL
POST
TO
THESE
GROUPS
JUST
AS
THEY
DO
