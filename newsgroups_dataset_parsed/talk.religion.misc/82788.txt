re
religion
and
homosexuality
in
article
dsoconnemidwayuchicagoedu
writes
first
of
all
as
far
as
i
know
only
male
homosexuality
is
explicitly
mentioned
in
the
bibles
so
youre
off
the
hook
there
actually
there
is
one
condemnation
of
lesbian
acts
in
the
bible
romans
i
think
in
any
event
there
are
plenty
of
people
in
many
denominations
who
do
not
consider
a
persons
sexual
identification
of
gaylesbianbisexual
as
an
immoral
lifestyle
choice
there
are
plenty
who
dont
read
the
bible
or
pray
for
that
matter
