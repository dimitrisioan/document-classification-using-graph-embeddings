what
right
recently
ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
sarcasm
i
mean
it
how
should
one
deal
with
a
man
who
is
convinced
that
he
is
acting
according
to
gods
will
and
who
there
jokke
fore
believes
that
he
is
doing
you
a
favour
by
stabbing
you
in
the
back
