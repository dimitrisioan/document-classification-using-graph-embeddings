ETERNAL
DAMNATION
IS
THE
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
CHOICE
ONE
MAKES
IN
REJECTING
GOD
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
JUMP
OFF
A
CLIFF
YOU
CAN
HARDLY
BLAME
GOD
FOR
YOU
GOING
SPLAT
AT
THE
BOTTOM
HE
KNOWS
THAT
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
JUMP
THAT
YOU
WILL
DIE
BUT
HE
WILL
NOT
PREVENT
YOU
FROM
MAKING
THAT
CHOICE
IN
FACT
HE
SENT
HIS
SON
TO
STAND
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
CLIFF
AND
TELL
EVERYONE
OF
WHAT
LIES
BELOW
TO
PROVE
THAT
POINT
JESUS
TOOK
THAT
PLUNGE
HIMSELF
BUT
HE
BEING
GOD
WAS
ABLE
TO
RISE
UP
AGAIN
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
CHRIST
AND
HAVE
CHOSEN
NOT
TO
JUMP
AND
IM
TRYING
TO
TELL
YOU
NOT
TO
JUMP
OR
ELSE
YOULL
GO
SPLAT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
LISTEN
TO
ME
AND
I
WONT
STOP
YOU
IF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
JUMP
I
ONLY
ASK
THAT
YOU
CHECK
IT
OUT
BEFORE
TAKING
THE
PLUNGE
YOU
OWE
IT
TO
YOURSELF
I
DONT
LIKE
SEEING
ANYONE
GO
SPLAT
IM
FOR
THE
MOMENT
INTERESTED
IN
THIS
NOTION
OF
THE
LEAP
OF
FAITH
ESTABLISHED
BY
KIERKEGAARD
IT
CLEARLY
POINTS
OUT
A
POSSIBLE
SOLUTION
TO
TRANSCENDENTAL
VALUES
WHAT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IS
THAT
IT
ALSO
CLEARLY
SHOWS
THE
EXISTENTIALISM
SYSTEM
WHERE
ANY
LEAP
TO
ANY
TRANSCENDENTAL
DIRECTION
IS
EQUAL
IN
OTHER
WORDS
I
MIGHT
NOT
JUMP
OFF
THE
CLIFF
MENTIONED
ABOVE
BUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
WILL
DECIDE
TO
WHAT
DIRECTION
I
WILL
GO
ACTUALLY
I
WILL
DO
IT
JUST
