RE
NEW
BIBLICAL
CONTRADICTIONS
FALLACIOUSLY
ANSWERED
JUDAS
I
PRODUCED
AN
ERROR
LAST
WEEK
ABOUT
CHORION
BY
THE
WAY
MR
DECENSO
YOU
REALLY
SHOULD
HAVE
LOOKED
IN
THE
INDEX
OF
YOUR
BAUERARNDTGINGRICH
GREEK
LEXICON
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
FOUND
THAT
THE
WORD
IN
ACTS
FOR
LOT
IS
KLEROS
NOT
CHORION
AS
STATED
BY
MR
ARCHER
AND
NOWHERE
IN
THE
VERY
LARGE
DISCUSSION
OF
KLEROS
IN
DONE
THE
TO
THEOLOGICAL
DICTIONARY
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
BY
BROMLEY
IS
THE
MEANING
BURIAL
PLOT
DISCUSSED
IT
DISCUSSES
THE
FORMS
OF
KLEROS
EG
KLEROS
KLEROO
ETC
AND
THE
VARIOUS
MEANINGS
OF
KLEROS
EG
PLOT
OF
LAND
AND
INHERITANCE
BUT
MENTIONS
NOTHING
ABOUT
CHORION
OR
BURIAL
PLOT
WHY
DOES
THIS
NOT
SURPRISE
ME
THUS
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
A
VERY
GOOD
THING
YOU
DUMPED
ARCHER
AS
A
REFERENCE
I
WAS
WRONG
I
ADMIT
THAT
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
HANDLE
ON
GREEK
GRAMMAR
AND
THUS
CONFUSED
KLEROS
THE
SECOND
TO
LAST
WORD
IN
ACTS
AS
BEING
THE
PLOT
OF
LAND
DISCUSSED
IN
ACTUALITY
IT
IS
CHORION
WHICH
IS
THE
LAST
WORD
ACTS
UNFORTUNATELY
MY
GREEK
DICTIONARY
DOES
NOT
DISCUSS
CHORION
SO
I
CANNOT
REPORT
AS
TO
THE
NUANCES
OF
THE
WORD
I
ABHOR
PUBLISHING
TRASH
I
ABHOR
IT
OF
MYSELF
EVEN
MORE
THAN
I
DO
FROM
OTHERS
BUT
SINCE
I
DO
NOT
PRESENT
MYSELF
AS
AN
AUTHORITY
ON
THE
SUBJECT
I
DO
NOT
FEEL
DISHONEST
THOUGH
I
DO
OPENLY
ADMIT
IGNORANCE
AND
INCOMPETENCE
IN
THIS
EXAMPLE
THUS
I
FELT
HONOR
BOUND
TO
DO
A
BETTER
SET
OF
RESEARCH
SPECIFICALLY
ON
THE
WORD
FIRST
IT
SHOULD
BE
NOTED
THAT
GREEK
GRAMMAR
IS
NOT
AS
TOUGH
AS
I
FIRST
ASSUMED
IT
IS
NOT
NONTRIVIAL
BY
ANY
MEANS
AND
I
STILL
AM
NOT
COMPETENT
WITH
IT
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
AS
OPAQUE
AS
I
HAD
THOUGHT
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
WHILE
THE
INDEX
FOR
THE
BAUERARNDTGINGRICH
GREEK
LEXICON
RENDERS
EACH
VERSE
IN

EACH

WITHIN
A

IS
PUT
IN

THUS
WHILE
THE
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
VERSE
IS
DECIPHERABLE
THE
SYNTAX
IS
FAR
FROM
CLEAR
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
A
GREEKENGLISH
INTRALINEAR
BIBLE
MAKES
THINGS
A
LOT
MORE
COMPREHENDABLE
AND
YES
THE
WORD
FOR

IN

IS
INDEED

AS
SOME
OF
THESE
BOOKS
GO
INTO
GREAT
DETAIL
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
THAT
THESE
BOOKS
ARE
ALL
INADEQUATE
AND
MR
ARCHER
IS
THE
ONLY
COMPETENT
SCHOLAR
IN

I
THINK
IT
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
MR

INVESTIGATIONS
INTO

TO
BE

AGAIN
AS
YOUR

SAID
IT
LACKING

AND
THUS

IS

SHOWN
WORTHLESS
AS
AN

BY

MR

I
WOULD
HAVE
HONORABLY
PRESENTED
MY
RESULTS
ON
THIS
MATTER
EVEN
IF
I
HAD
FOUND
THEM
TO
SUPPORT
MR
ARCHERS
CONTENTIONS
BY
THE
WAY
AMONG
THESE
LEXICONS
EG
ROBINSONS
IS
THE
DEFINITION
OF
AGROS
THE
WORD
USED
IN
MATTHEW
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
FIELD
BOUGHT
THE
WORD
AGROS
IS
DEFINED
AS
A
FIELD
IN
THE
COUNTRY
CHORION
IS
SPECIFICALLY
NOTED
AS
A
SYNONYM
TO
AGROS
THIS
IS
SIGNIFICANT
AS
IT
IS
EVIDENCE
OF
HOW
SILLY
BULLINGERS
EXEGISIS
WAS
WHICH
STATED
THAT
THE
WORD
FOR
FIELD
IN
MATTHEW
IE
AGROS
IS
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
WORD
FOR
FIELD
IN
ACTS
IE
CHORION
AND
THUS
WE
MUST
BE
TALKING
ABOUT
TWO
DIFFERENT
FIELDS
OF
COURSE
YOU
ALREADY
ADMIT
HOW
STUPID
BULLINGERS
EXEGISIS
IS
BUT
THIS
WAS
A
SMALL
SERENDIPITY
WHICH
DRIVES
THE
POINT
HOME
SO
AS
OF
NOW
UNLESS
MR
DECENSO
SHOW
COMPELLING
REASONS
TO
BELIEVE
OTHERWISE
EG
A
REPUTABLE

WITH
REPUTABLE

I
CONSIDER
THIS
