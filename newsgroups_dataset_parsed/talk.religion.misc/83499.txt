THE
BAD
PRESS
ISLAM
HAS
RECIEVED
I
RECENTLY
READ
AN
ARTICLE
IN
A
LOCAL
PAPER
WRITTEN
BY
AN
ISLAMIC
PERSON
WHO
WAS
UPSET
WITH
THE
WAY
ISLAM
HAS
BEEN
PORTRAYED
BY
WESTERN
MEDIA
WHEN
A
TERRORIST
ACTION
TAKES
PLACE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
IT
IS
ALWAYS
PLAYED
UP
AS
AN
ISLAMIC
TERRORIST
HOWEVER
WHEN
THE
A
SERBIAN
TERRORIST
ATTACKS
THE
CROATIONS
ITS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
TERRORIST
ITS
JUST
A
TERRORIST
I
HAVE
OFTEN
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
THIS
TO
SOME
CLOSE
FRIENDS
WHO
BELIEVE
THE
PRESS
THAT
ISLAM
IS
SOMEHOW
TIED
TO
VIOLENCE
OFTEN
TIMES
YOU
HEAR
THINGS
LIKE
THEY
JUST
DONT
VALUE
HUMAN
LIFE
LIKE
WE
DO
AND
SO
ON
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HAD
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
FOR
HOW
WE
CAN
CHANGE
THIS
IMAGE
OR
HOW
I
CAN
HELP
MY
FRIENDS
TO
SEE
THAT
THIS
IS
JUST
HYPE
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
SERIOUS
SUGGESTIONS
OR
COMMENTS
VIA
EMAIL
AND
IM
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
ABOUT
HOW
RIGHT
THE
PRESS
IS
