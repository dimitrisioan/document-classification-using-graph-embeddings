THE
LAWS
OF
GOD
WAS
RE
A
KIND
AND
LOVING
GOD
IN
ARTICLE
ROB
LANPHIER
WRITES
THESE
ARE
TWO
CONFLICTING
STATEMENTS
TO
SAY
ONE
IS
A
CLARIFICATION
OF
THE
OTHER
IS
A
BREACH
OF
LOGIC
I
DONT
MIND
PEOPLE
SHIFTING
THEIR
POSITION
ON
AN
ISSUE
IT
IRRITATES
ME
WHEN
IT
IS
SAID
UNDER
THE
PREMISE
THAT
NO
CHANGE
WAS
MADE
WHAT
ABOUT
DEUTERONOMY
IS
IT
WRONG
NOW
DID
JESUS
CHANGE
THAT
IF
ANYTHING
HE
CLARIFIED
THE
LAW
SUCH
AS
IN
THAT
QUOTE
YOU
MADE
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
VERSES
JESUS
TAKES
SEVERAL
PORTIONS
OF
THE
LAW
AND
EXPOUNDS
UPON
THE
LAW
GIVING
CLEARER
MEANING
TO
WHAT
GOD
INTENDED
SURE
HE
DOES
THIS
HOWEVER
HE
DOESNT
ADDRESS
THE
NOTION
OF
STONING
NONVIRGIN
BRIDES
BECAUSE
THIS
NEEDS
NO
CLARIFICATION
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
DENY
THAT
DEUTERONOMY
IS
NOT
PATENTLY
CLEAR
IN
ITS
INTENT
I
SEE
WHAT
YOU
ARE
GETTING
AT
OR
AT
LEAST
I
THINK
I
DO
CORRECT
ME
IF
I
AM
MISTAKEN
BUT
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
ASKING
ME
IF
I
STILL
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
SHOULD
UPHOLD
ALL
OF
THE
LAWS
PERTAINING
TO
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
FOR
SUCH
THINGS
AS
ADULTERY
RAPE
AND
OTHER
HEINOUS
CRIMES
AS
YOU
MAY
RECALL
JESUS
WAS
CONFRONTED
BY
THIS
SAME
QUESTION
IN
REGARDS
TO
THE
ADULTRESS
WHO
WAS
CAUGHT
IN
THE
ACT
AND
BROUGHT
BEFORE
JESUS
AND
HIS
REPLY
LET
HE
WHO
IS
WITHOUT
SIN
CAST
THE
FIRST
STONE
JESUS
DOES
NOT
DENY
THE
SENTENCE
THAT
IS
TO
DUE
FOR
THIS
VIOLATION
OF
THE
LAW
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
OF
THIS
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
AGREE
WITH
ME
THAT
THERE
ARE
IN
TODAYS
WORLD
A
LOT
OF
MODERNDAY
PHARISEES
WHO
KNOW
THE
BIBLE
FROM
END
TO
END
BUT
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
IT
WHAT
GOOD
IS
HEAD
KNOWLEDGE
IF
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
THE
HEART
ILL
AGREE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
MODERN
DAY
PHARISEES
THAT
KNOW
THE
BIBLE
FROM
END
TO
END
AND
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
IT
DEPENDING
ON
HOW
THEY
USE
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
THEY
CAN
BE
SCARY
THEY
CAN
ARGUE
ANY
POSITION
THEY
DESIRE
AND
BACK
IT
UP
WITH
SELECTED
PARTS
OF
THE
BIBLE
SUCH
PHARISEES
INCLUDE
DAVID
KORESH
AND
ADOLPH
HITLER
I
WILL
QUALIFY
THIS
BY
SAYING
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THEY
ACTUALLY
BELIEVED
WHAT
THEY
WERE
PREACHING
BUT
THE
ENDS
CERTAINLY
MADE
THE
MEANS
LOOK
FRIGHTENING
AGREED
HOWEVER
JUST
AS
SCARY
ARE
THOSE
THAT
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
OF
THE
BIBLE
BUT
BELIEVE
EVERY
WORD
IN
FACT
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
SCARIER
SINCE
THERE
ARE
FAR
MORE
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
FROM
WHAT
IVE
SEEN
IN
ADDITION
THEY
ARE
VERY
EASY
TO
MANIPULATE
BY
THE
AFOREMENTIONED
PHARISEES
SINCE
THEY
DONT
KNOW
ENOUGH
TO
DEBATE
WITH
THESE
PEOPLE
AGREED
ALSO
IF
ONE
IS
TO
USE
THE
BIBLE
AS
A
REFERENCE
ONE
MUST
ALWAYS
BE
OPEN
TO
DIFFERENT
INTERPRETATIONS
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
I
HAVE
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
TO
VERIFY
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
WORD
IF
WHAT
THE
SPIRIT
TELLS
ME
IS
NOT
BACKED
UP
IN
SCRIPTURE
THEN
THE
SPIRIT
I
AM
COMMUNICATING
WITH
IS
NOT
OF
GOD
AFTER
ALL
JESUS
TELLS
US
TO
TEST
THE
SPIRITS
TO
KNOW
FOR
SURE
THAT
IT
IS
FROM
GOD
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOT
JUST
A
SET
OF
RULES
ITS
A
LIFESTYLE
THAT
CHANGES
ONES
PERSPECTIVES
AND
PERSONAL
CONDUCT
AND
IT
DEMANDS
OBEDIENCE
TO
GODS
WILL
NO
IT
DEMANDS
OBEDIENCE
TO
A
BOOK
IF
GOD
CAME
DOWN
AND
PERSONALLY
TOLD
ME
HOW
I
SHOULD
BEHAVE
THEN
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
I
WOULD
BE
DOING
GODS
WILL
BY
DOING
IT
HOWEVER
IF
PREACHERS
PASTORS
AND
EVANGELISTS
TELL
ME
TO
OBEY
THE
WILL
OF
A
BOOK
WRITTEN
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
DEAD
FOR
CLOSE
TO
TWO
MILLENIA
EVEN
LONGER
FOR
THE
OT
EVEN
IF
I
FOLLOW
EVERYTHING
IN
IT
WITH
MY
HEART
I
COULD
SCARCELY
BE
HONEST
WITH
MYSELF
BY
SAYING
IM
DOING
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
I
OBEY
WHAT
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
TELLS
ME
TO
DO
THE
SPIRIT
WILL
NOT
VIOLATE
ANYTHING
THAT
IS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
BIBLE
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
I
DO
NOT
WORSHIP
PASTORS
PREACHERS
MY
WIFE
MY
MOTHER
OR
MY
FATHER
WHAT
THEY
TELL
ME
DOES
NOT
CARRY
THE
WEIGHT
OF
WHAT
GOD
TELLS
ME
TO
DO
AND
HIS
COMMANDS
ARE
RIENFORCED
IN
THE
BIBLE
SOME
PEOPLE
CAN
LIVE
BY
IT
BUT
MANY
OTHERS
CANNOT
OR
WILL
NOT
THAT
IS
THEIR
CHOICE
AND
I
HAVE
TO
RESPECT
IT
BECAUSE
GOD
RESPECTS
IT
TOO
WELL
IF
GOD
RESPECTS
IT
SO
MUCH
HOW
COME
THERE
IS
TALK
IN
THE
BIBLE
ABOUT
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
FOR
NONBELIEVERS
I
SEE
LITTLE
RESPECT
EMINATING
FROM
THE
GOD
OF
THE
BIBLE
I
SEE
A
SELFISH
AND
SPITEFUL
GOD
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
IS
THE
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
CHOICE
ONE
MAKES
IN
REJECTING
GOD
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
JUMP
OFF
A
CLIFF
YOU
CAN
HARDLY
BLAME
GOD
FOR
YOU
GOING
SPLAT
AT
THE
BOTTOM
HE
KNOWS
THAT
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
JUMP
THAT
YOU
WILL
DIE
BUT
HE
WILL
NOT
PREVENT
YOU
FROM
MAKING
THAT
CHOICE
IN
FACT
HE
SENT
HIS
SON
TO
STAND
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
CLIFF
AND
TELL
EVERYONE
OF
WHAT
LIES
BELOW
TO
PROVE
THAT
POINT
JESUS
TOOK
THAT
PLUNGE
HIMSELF
BUT
HE
BEING
GOD
WAS
ABLE
TO
RISE
UP
AGAIN
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
CHRIST
AND
HAVE
CHOSEN
NOT
TO
JUMP
AND
IM
TRYING
TO
TELL
YOU
NOT
TO
JUMP
OR
ELSE
YOULL
GO
SPLAT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
LISTEN
TO
ME
AND
I
WONT
STOP
YOU
IF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
JUMP
I
ONLY
ASK
THAT
YOU
CHECK
IT
OUT
BEFORE
TAKING
THE
PLUNGE
YOU
OWE
IT
TO
YOURSELF
I
DONT
LIKE
SEEING
ANYONE
GO
SPLAT
GOD
BE
WITH
YOU
