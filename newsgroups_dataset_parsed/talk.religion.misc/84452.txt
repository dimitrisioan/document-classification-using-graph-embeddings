ANTHONY

ROSE
WRITES
CAPSER
BEFORE
YOU
DECEIVE
EVERONE
INTO
THINKING
THAT
THE
LATTERDAY
SAINTS
HAVE
UNDERGONE
UNDUE
PERSECUTION
THROUGH
THE
YEARS
FOR
JUST
BELIEVING
IN
THEIR
RELIGION
PERHAPS
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TELL
US
ALL
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
THE
MOUNTAIN
MEADOW
MASSACRES
AND
ALL
THE
KILLINGS
THAT
WERE
DONE
UNDER
THE
BLOOD
ATONEMENT
DOCTRINE
AT
THE
COMMAND
OF
BRIGHAM
YOUNG
I
RECENTLY
WATCHED
A
AN
EPISODE
OF
THE
OLD
WEST
A
TV
SHOW
ON
THE
DISCOVERY
CHANNEL
OR
PERHAPS
THE
AE
NETWORK
THE
ONE
HOSTED
BY
KENNY
ROGERS
THIS
EPISODE
WAS
ALL
ABOUT
THE
MORMONS
AND
HOW
THEY
SETTLED
UTAH
ETC
A
LARGE
PORTION
OF
THE
BROADCAST
WAS
ABOUT
THE
MOUNTAIN
MEADOWS
MASSACRE
THE
PROGRAM
VERY
SPECIFICALLY
POINTED
OUT
THAT
BRIGHAM
YOUNG
KNEW
NOTHING
ABOUT
THE
INCIDENT
UNTIL
LONG
AFTER
IT
HAD
HAPPENED
BEFORE
TELEGRAPH
AND
IT
OCCURED
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SEVERAL
MEN
INCITING
A
BUNCH
OF
PARONOID
MOROMN
SETTLERS
INTO
WHAT
AMOUNTED
TO
A
MOB
ALL
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THE
INCIDENT
WERE
PROSECUTED
AND
ECCOMUNICATED
FROM
THE
LDS
CHURCH
I
SUGGEST
YOU
WATCH
A
RERUN
OF
THAT
EPISODE
THEY
PLAY
THEM
OVER
AND
OVER
AND
SEE
WHAT
THEY
NONMORMONS
HAVE
TO
SAY
ABOUT
IT

TRUTH
AND
THE
TRUTH
SHALL
MAKE
YOU
FREE
