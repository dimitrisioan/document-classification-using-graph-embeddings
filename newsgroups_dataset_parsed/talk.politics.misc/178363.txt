re
new
study
out
on
gay
percentage
in
article
writes
it
seems
that
conservatives
are
putting
a
lot
of
effort
into
showing
up
the
figure
but
that
really
doesnt
make
a
difference
like
i
said
who
cares
how
many
there
are
would
the
fact
that
theyre
only
of
the
population
justify
discrimination
against
them
i
dont
think
so
uh
well
golly
gee
whiz
let
me
see
when
the
new
president
as
his
first
big
policy
act
tries
to
force
homosexuals
acceptance
thereof
on
the
military
despite
polls
showing
a
consistent
against
it
and
the
minority
is
only
well
gee
i
sure
think
that
is
newsworthy
tells
you
something
about
the
fascist
politics
being
practiced
there
are
actually
people
that
still
believe
love
canal
was
some
kind
of
environmental
disaster
weird
eh
these
opinions
are
mine
and
you
cant
have
em
but
ill
rent
em
cheap
