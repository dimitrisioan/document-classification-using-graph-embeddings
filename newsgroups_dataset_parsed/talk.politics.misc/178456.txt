actually
i
bet
you
more
gaybi
men
are
as
not
as
promiscuous
as
gay
men
because
more
of
them
could
have
the
option
of
living
a
straight
life
and
with
social
pressures
probably
would
at
least
try
geez
where
have
you
been
ryan
i
proposed
this
theory
months
ago
lets
take
it
one
step
further
even
if
as
the
surveys
show
up
to
of
all
men
have
had
a
homosexual
encounter
then
there
must
be
an
even
larger
percentage
of
people
who
have
had
homosexual
erotic
fantasies
but
if
less
than
of
the
population
is
gay
what
can
we
say
about
these
people
who
dont
identify
as
gay
but
have
demonstrated
gay
potential
obviously
a
large
chunk
of
these
people
chose
or
more
accurately
were
forced
to
choose
by
force
of
religion
and
social
sanction
to
put
those
feelings
aside
to
be
heterosexual
obviously
cramer
and
kaldis
fall
into
this
category
these
people
are
the
ones
who
are
so
hung
up
on
choice
obviously
since
they
chose
everyone
must
have
and
homosexuals
are
just
flaunting
their
perversion
by
choosing
not
to
go
along
with
what
society
has
dictated
of
course
im
that
most
awful
of
perverts
i
chose
i
gleefully
admit
that
i
was
heterosexual
until
i
met
the
right
man
and
chose
to
indulge
in
my
homoerotic
potential

the
purpose
of
writing
is
to
inflate
weak
ideas
obscure
pure
reasoning
and
inhibit
clarity
with
a
little
pratice
writing
can
be
an
intimidating
and
impenetrable
