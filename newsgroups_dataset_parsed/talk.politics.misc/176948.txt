DOUG
WE
ALL
KNOW
THAT
ROE
V
WADE
PREVENTS
STATES
FROM
PROHIBITING
ABORTIONS
NECESSARY
TO
PRESERVE
THE
LIFE
OR
HEALTH
OF
THE
WOMAN
ONLY
VERY
STUPID
PEOPLE
SUCH
AS
YOURSELF
CONFUSE
A
DISCUSSION
OF
MENTAL
HEALTH
RELATED
TO
JANE
DOE
WHO
WAS
IN
A
MENTAL
INSTITUTION
AND
ATTEMPT
TO
CLAIM
THAT
THIS
SAME
ARGUMENT
COULD
BE
APPLIED
TO
A
WOMAN
WHO
DECIDED
SHE
WANTED
AN
ABORTION
BECAUSE
SHE
WAS
HAVING
A
BAD
HAIR
DAY
AS
YOU
WELL
KNOW
THE
FACTS
ARE
THAT
THERE
ARE
ABOUT
THIRDTRIMESTER
ABORTIONS
PERFORMED
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
ANNUALLY
AND
THOSE
ARE
ONLY
DONE

HMMM
HUMAN
GESTATION
PERIOD
IS
SOMETHING
LIKE
WEEKS
THAT
MEANS
THIRD
TRIMESTER
ABORTIONS
ARE
THOSE
DONE
AFTER
WEEKS
IN
CONSULTING
A
WORLD
ALMANAC
I
SEE
THAT
OF
ABORTIONS
IN
WERE
DONE
AT
WEEKS
OR
MORE
THATS
ABOUT
ABORTIONS
IN
AFTER
WEEKS
UNLESS
THE
NUMBER
OF
ABORTIONS
PERFORMED
HAS
DROPPED
DRAMATICALLY
OR
A
LOT
OF
ABORTIONS
ARE
DONE
BETWEEN
AND
WEEKS
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
WRONG
BY
THE
WAY
ROE
V
WADE
ALLOWED
STATES
TO
ADOPT
VERY
VERY
BROAD
PROHIBITIONS
ON
THIRDTRIMESTER
ABORTIONS
BUT
SOME
STATES
SUCH
AS
CALIFORNIA
DECLINED
TO
DO
SO
IT
WAS
REPORTED
THAT
WHAT
FINALLY
STOPPED
THIRD
TRIMESTER
ELECTIVE
ABORTIONS
IN
THE
BAY
AREA
WASNT
LAW
BUT
THAT
THE
ONLY
HOSPITAL
DOING
THEM
RAN
OUT

THEN
DOCTORS
WILLING
TO
DO
THEM
NOT
SURPRISINGLY
THE
BAY
AREA
NOW
CHAPTER
WAS
TERRIBLY
UPSET
ABOUT
THIS
I
REMAIN
PROCHOICE
BUT
WHEN
PROCHOICERS
COMPARE
ABORTION
IN
A
CLINIC
TO
A
RELIGIOUS
RITUAL
IN
A
CHURCH
YOU
HAVE
TO
START
WONDERING
A
BIT
IF
THE
PROLIFE
CRITICISM
OF
ABORTION
AS
MODERN
HUMAN
SACRIFICE
