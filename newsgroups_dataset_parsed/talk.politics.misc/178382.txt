WELL
YES
AND
NO
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
ARE
PROPAGANDA
AND
IT
IS
THEREFORE
DIFFICULT
TO
DETERMINE
PRECISELY
WHAT
MADDISON
ETC
WERE
UP
TO
FROM
THEM
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
WAYS
TO
LOOK
AT
THEM
ONE
IS
WE
WANT
YOU
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
CONSTITUTION
SO
WELL
SAY
ANYTHING
THAT
WE
THINK
WILL
APPEAL
TO
YOU
OR
THE
MORE
STRAIGHTFORWARD
THIS
IS
WHY
WE
THINK
WHAT
WEVE
SUGGESTED
IN
THIS
CONSTITUTION
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
YOU
CLEARLY
CONSIDER
THE
FORMER
TO
BE
THE
PRIMARY
SITUATION
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
MAKE
PAINS
TO
POINT
OUT
WHERE
THE
CONSITUTION
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
AGINST
THE
NEW
YORKERS
INTERESTS
ALSO
THEY
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
RAISE
OPPOSITION
BY
BASING
THEIR
ADVOCACY
ON
UNPOPULAR
PRINCIPLES
HORRORS
APPEALING
TO
POPULAR
PRINCIPLES
CAN
WE
PERHAPS
AS
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
THE
CONSTITUTION
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
WRITTEN
TO
APPEAL
TO
THE
PRINCIPLES
RATHER
THAN
AS
YOU
APPEAR
TO
BELIEVE
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
WITH
SOMETHING
ELSE
IN
MIND
AND
PROPOGANDA
PUT
OUT
BY
ITS
SUPPORTERS
BUT
LETS
BE
HONEST
ABOUT
SOMETHING
HERE
WHEN
WAS
THE
LAST
TIME
YOU
BROUGHT
UP
ALL
THE
VALID
POINTS
AGAINST
YOUR
OWN
ARGUMENTS
OR
ARE
THEY
SIMPLY
PROPOGRANDA
WE
CANT
KNOW
WHAT
PHILL
REALLY
MEANS
BECAUSE
HES
OBVIOUSLY
USING
ARGUMENTS
DESIGNED
TO
CONVINCE
WELL
I
KNOW
HAMILTON
WAS
A
DYED
IN
THE
WOOL
MONARCHIST
AND
PROBABLY
THE
AUTHORITARIAN
EXTREME
TO
JEFFERSONS
DEMOCRATIC
IMPULES
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
SUGGEST
AS
A
MEANS
OF
DETERMINING
THEIR
OPINIONS
ON
THE
GOVERNMENT
IF
WE
DONT
CONSIDER
WHAT
THEY
WROTE
ABOUT
THE
GOVERNMENT
I
DONT
PROPOSE
THAT
ANY
MEANS
EXISTS
FOR
DETERMINING
THEIR
TRUE
OPINIONS
THUS
THEIR
TRUE
OPINIONS
DIED
WITH
THEM
AND
ARE
OF
LITTLE
HELP
TODAY
THEIR
OPINIONS
HAVE
NOT
THE
SLIGHTEST
BEARING
ON
THE
MATTER
THOUGH
ONLY
THEIR
ARGUMENTS
THESE
ARE
TRUE
OR
FALSE
REGARDLESS
OF
WHO
SAID
THEM
OR
WHY
IF
THEYRE
TRUE
OR
FALSE
REGARDLES
OF
WHY
THEY
WERE
SAID
WHY
ON
EARTH
DID
YOU
MAKE
A
POINT
OF
CALLING
THEM
PROPOGRANDA
THAT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
IRRELEVENT
THE
DIFFICULTY
THAT
MOST
US
POSTERS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
IS
IN
CONSIDERING
THAT
THEIR
ARGUMENTS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
FLAWED
OR
NO
LONGER
APPLY
TO
MODERN
SOCIETIES
OH
I
HAVE
NO
ARGUMENT
WITH
QUESTIONING
THEM
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THEY
NO
LONGER
APPLY
BUT
THATS
BECAUSE
I
THINK
MOST
OF
THEM
WERE
GOOD
ARGUMENTS
IM
NOT
ENTIRELY
HAPPY
ABOUT
THE
SITUATION
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
ONLY
APPLIED
TO
A
MINORITY
OF
THE
TIME
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
ALONE
IS
SUFFICIENT
TO
INVALIDATE
THEM
IF
THEY
WERE
ALIVE
TODAY
THE
ONE
OPINION
WE
COULD
COUNT
UPON
THESE
MEN
TO
EXPRESS
IS
THAT
A
CAREFUL
STUDY
OF
THE
MECHANISMS
OF
GOVERNMENT
IS
NECESSARY
AND
THAT
AN
ONGOING
IMPROVEMENT
OF
THE
SAME
IS
REQUIRED
THEY
GAVE
THEIR
OPINIONS
IN
CERTAIN
AREAS
AND
HAVE
BEEN
PROVED
RIGHT
IN
OTHER
AREAS
THEY
GOT
IT
WRONG
THEY
ENSURED
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
MECHANISM
TO
ADAPT
AND
IMPROVE
THE
CONSITITUTION
THIS
CAN
ONLY
HAPPEN
IF
THERE
IS
A
WILLINGNESS
TO
ACCEPT
THAT
THE
STRUCTURAL
PROBLEMS
WITHIN
THE
US
POLITICAL
SYSTEM
MAY
REQUIRE
CONSTITUTIONAL
CHANGE
AS
A
SOLUTION
SINCE
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
IS
THE
BASIS
FOR
THE
US
POLITICAL
SYSTEM
MOST
CHANGES
IN
IT
WOULD
REQUIRE
CONSTITUTIONAL
CHANGE
IN
THIS
PARTICULAR
CASE
HOWEVER
THE
FILLIBUSTER
IS
A
MATTER
OF
PROCEDURE
AND
TRADITION
IT
ONLY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
PART
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
IF
THE
SENATE
WAS
LESS
POWERFUL
THAN
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
THAN
WED
ALMOST
HAVE
TO
STATE
THAT
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
WAS
ALSO
IN
FACT
THEY
BOTH
WERE
BECAUSE
THE
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
HAD
MUCH
GREATER
POWER
THAN
DID
THE
AMERICAN
SYSTEM
IN
PRINCIPLE
NO
IN
PRACTICE
YES
IN
PRINCIPLE
NO
THAT
THEY
HAD
LESS
POWER
OF
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
HAD
LESS
POWER
THE
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
TODAY
IS
THEORETICALY
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
WILL
OF
THE
MONARCH
BY
CONVENTION
ANY
MONARCH
SEEKING
TO
EXERCISE
THAT
POWER
IS
DEPOSED
THE
SUBTLY
IS
THAT
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
IS
NOT
ABLE
TO
IDENTIFY
THEIR
POLITICS
WITH
THE
NATIONAL
INTEREST
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER
THAT
US
PRESIDENTS
REGULARLY
DO
PHILL
WERE
DISCUSING
THE
POWER
OF
LEGISLATIVE
HOUSES
WHILE
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
IS
MEMBER
OF
PARLIAMENT
HE
IS
MORE
ANALGOUS
ALTHOUGH
BADLY
TO
THE
US
PRESIDENT
NOW
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
HOW
THE
US
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
IS
IN
PRINCIPLE
MORE
POWERFUL
THAN
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
OR
THE
SENATE
BUT
IN
PRACTICE
IS
LESS
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
THE
WRITERS
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
REALLY
INTENDED
FOR
THEM
TO
BE
MORE
POWERFUL
BUT
GOSH
DARN
THE
THING
WAS
RATIFIED
BEFORE
THEY
REALIZED
THEYD
FORGOTTEN
TO
PUT
THOSE
EXTRA
RESTRICTIONS
ON
THE
SENATE
IN
I
DISAGREE
THE
SYSTEM
IS
NOT
TOO
SLOW
IT
WAS
SIMPLY
DESIGNED
TO
HANDLE
LESS
THAN
IT
HAS
DEMANDED
THAT
IT
HANDLE
AS
SOMEBODY
IN
WASHINGTON
PUT
IT
WHOSE
NAME
I
FORGET
CONGRESS
HAS
BECOME
EVERYBODYS
CITY
COUNCIL
ONE
REASON
FOR
THAT
IS
THAT
AT
EVERY
LEVEL
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
RENDERED
UNABLE
TO
COME
TO
DECISIONS
THESE
DECISIONS
ARE
PUSHED
UP
TO
THE
NEXT
HIGHER
LEVEL
INSTEAD
NOT
AT
ALL
AS
ANY
ENTRY
LEVEL
POLITICAL
SCIENCE
COURSE
WILL
TELL
YOU
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
LAWS
IMPLEMENTED
WILL
ALWAYS
CHOOSE
THE
LEVEL
OF
GOVERNMENT
TO
ATTACK
WHICH
PRESENTS
THEM
WITH
THE
BEST
CHANCE
OF
GETTING
WHAT
THEY
WANT
WITH
NATIONAL
INTEREST
GROUPS
IT
IS
SIMPLY
A
VERY
RATIONAL
THING
TO
DO
TO
WANT
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TO
ENACT
A
LAW
RATHER
THAN
THE
STATES
LESS
PEOPLE
TO
PERSUADE
AND
LESS
CONTRIBUTIONS
TO
MAKE
WHY
DO
THOSE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
ABORTION
PRIMARILY
CONCENTRATE
AT
THE
FEDERAL
LEVEL
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IF
THEY
WIN
THAT
BATTLE
ALL
THE
LITTLE
STATE
BATTLEFIELDS
ARE
WON
BY
EXTENSION
THE
SAME
EXTENDS
TO
INSURANCE
MEDICINE
AND
MOST
OTHER
QUESTIONS
LOCAL
GOVERNMENT
HAS
NOT
FAILED
IN
THAT
IT
HASNT
DONE
WHAT
IT
SHOULD
BUT
THAT
IT
IS
DOMINATED
BY
LOCAL
INTERESTS
THUS
NONLOCAL
INTERESTS
WHO
WANT
LOCALITIES
TO
ABIDE
BY
THEIR
RULES
CANT
GET
THEIR
RULES
PAST
THE
LOCAL
GOVERNMENT
THUS
SINCE
THEYVE
GOT
MORE
CLOUT
ONLY
IN
THE
WRONG
PLACE
THEY
APPEAL
TO
THE
NEXT
HIGHER
LEVEL
BECAUSE
IT
CAN
IMPOSE
ITS
WILL
ON
THE
LOWER
I
MEAN
LETS
GET
REAL
HERE
DO
WE
REALLY
NEED
THE
CONGRES
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
DECIDING
THAT
X
TRAFFICE
LIGHT
SHOULD
BE
ON
THUS
AND
SUCH
PATTERN
OR
THAT
CARJACKING
NEEDS
TO
BE
A
FEDERAL
AS
OPPOSED
TO
A
LOCAL
CRIME
THE
MORE
PEOPLE
WANT
THE
MORE
CONGRESS
WILL
TAKE
POWER
TO
SELL
IT
TO
THEM
FOR
THEIR
VOTES
I
DONT
THINK
THE
RISE
OF
SPECIAL
INTERESTS
IS
COINCIDENCE
WITH
THE
INCREASED
POWER
OF
CONGRESS
CONGRESS
IS
MORE
THAN
CAPABLE
OF
QUICK
ACTION
AND
HAS
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
POWER
AND
TIME
ON
ITS
HANDS
IF
IT
CONFINED
ITSELF
TO
WHAT
ITS
ORIGINAL
JURISIDICTION
WAS
AND
ALLOWED
MORE
LOCAL
AUTONOMY
IF
THEY
WERE
TO
START
FROM
A
SOCIAL
WELFARE
MODEL
INSTEAD
OF
THE
CURRENT
NO
STATE
SUBSIDY
MOTTO
THEY
WOULD
BE
BETTER
PLACED
AS
IT
IS
THERE
IS
PLENTY
OF
STATE
MONEY
BEING
HANDED
OUT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
IT
IS
DISTRIBUTED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
POWER
IN
CONGRESS
AND
NOT
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
ACTUAL
NEED
BINGO
THE
HIGHER
UP
THE
GOVERNMENTAL
LADDER
THE
LESS
ACTUAL
NEED
MATTERS
BECAUSE
POLITICAL
POWER
CAN
BE
CONCENTRATED
AT
HIGHER
LEVELS
WHILE
PEOPLE
WITH
LESS
CLOUD
ONLY
FIND
THEMSELVES
REDUCED
TO
IN
EFFECTIVENESS
IN
ORDER
TO
SET
UP
A
SCHOOL
PROJECT
IN
NEW
YORK
STATE
YOU
HAVE
TO
PAY
OFF
THE
OTHER
STATES
WITH
PORK
DEFENSE
CONTRACTS
AGRICULTURAL
SUBSIDIES
ETC
OR
TO
BE
PRECISE
OF
THE
STATES
SINCE
YOU
NEED
TO
BEAT
THE
FILIBUSTER
THEN
WHY
NOT
SIMPLY
LEAVE
NEW
YORKS
EDUCATION
TO
NEW
YORK
I
REMAIN
UNCONCINVED
THAT
THERE
IS
ANY
STATE
IN
THE
UNION
WHICH
IS
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
EDUCATING
ITS
OWN
CHILDREN
IF
THATS
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
DO
AND
IF
YOU
LEAVE
IT
TO
THEM
YOU
ONLY
HAVE
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
THE
PORK
IN
THAT
STATE
AND
SINCE
INDUSTRIES
CANT
CONCENTRATE
THEIR
POLITICAL
POWER
AND
WEALTH
RATHER
THEY
MUST
DIVIDE
IT
AMONG
THE
STATES
TO
TRY
AND
GET
WHAT
THEY
WANT
INDIVIDUAL
VOICES
HAVE
MORE
RELATIVE
IMPACT
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
FILLIBUSTER
IS
NOT
THAT
YOU
MUST
BUY
OFF
STATES
BUT
THAT
THE
CONGRESS
HAS
ACQUIRED
TOO
MUCH
POWER
TO
SELL
PORK
IT
IS
NOT
A
CASE
OF
THE
SYSTEM
OF
GOVERNMENT
THEY
CREATED
FAILING
BUT
THAT
IT
IS
OPERATING
UNDER
A
SET
OF
CONDITIONS
THEY
SPECIFICALLY
WANTED
TO
AVOID
NAMELY
A
CONCENTRATION
OF
POWER
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THEN
THAT
THE
PROPER
THING
TO
DO
IS
NOT
TO
REDUCE
THE
POWER
OF
EITHER
HOUSE
IN
SOME
ATTEMPT
TO
GREASE
THE
WHEELS
ALL
YOULL
GET
THEN
IS
A
SYSTEM
WHICH
MOVES
QUICKER
TO
DO
STUPID
THINGS
IT
WOULD
MAKE
MORE
SENSE
TO
MAKE
MORE
DECISIONS
AT
A
LOCAL
LEVEL
NO
YOU
HAVE
TO
BREAK
THE
MACHINE
FREE
OF
SEIZURE
BEFORE
YOU
CAN
REDIRECT
IT
BUT
WHY
ON
EARTH
SHOULD
WE
WANT
TO
REDIRECT
IT
YOU
SAID
YOURSELF
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
SELL
PORK
TO
GET
THINGS
THROUGH
CONGRESS
IF
CONGRES
HAS
LESS
AUTHORITY
TO
SELL
PORK
AND
RETAINS
ITS
AUTHORITY
TO
ENACT
NATIONAL
LEGISLATION
WITHIN
ITS
GRANTED
JURISDICTION
THE
PORK
PROBLEM
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCED
THE
CURRENT
BLOCKS
ON
POWER
SIMPLY
ABSOLVE
CONGRESS
OF
ANY
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
COME
TO
A
DECISION
THE
CURRENT
BLOCKS
ESSENTIALLY
STATE
THAT
INACTION
IS
PREFERABLE
TO
ACTION
THUS
IT
THE
SYSTEM
IS
WEIGHTED
AGAINST
ACTION
CONSIDERING
THE
GOVERNMENT
THE
USUALLY
THE
INSTITUTION
WITH
THE
SOLE
POWER
TO
ENFORCE
ITS
DECISIONS
BY
FORCE
I
CONSIDER
BIAS
AGAINST
MAKING
THOSE
DECISIONS
A
GOOD
THING
PUSHING
THE
DECISIONS
LOWER
IN
THE
PYRAMID
WONT
WORK
UNLESS
THE
LOWER
LEVELS
ARE
LESS
CORRUPT
IN
MOST
CASES
THEY
ARE
WORSE
NOT
BETTER
THE
DIFFERENCE
WITH
THE
LOWER
PYRAMID
IS
THAT
A
THEY
HAVE
MORE
LEGAL
LEGITIMATE
AUTHORITY
IN
MOST
MATTERS
UNDER
OUR
CONSTITUTION
THAN
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
AND
B
AT
THOSE
LOWER
LEVELS
POWER
IS
HARDER
TO
CONCENTRATE
AND
C
YOU
GET
THE
BENEFIT
OF
NOT
IMPOSING
NEW
DEICISONS
ON
EVERYBODY
AT
ONCE
YOU
GET
TO
SEE
THEM
TRIED
OUT
WITHOUT
A
NATIONAL
DECISION
CONGRESSIONAL
ACTION
USUALLY
TREATS
THE
ENTIRE
COUNTRY
AS
A
WHOLE
YET
EVEN
WITH
SIMILAR
PROBLEMS
IN
DIFFERENT
AREAS
DIFFERENT
SOLUTIONS
MAY
BE
CALLED
FOR
AND
WHILE
I
OFTEN
DONT
AGREE
WITH
THE
DECISIONS
MY
LOCAL
AND
STATE
REPS
MAKE
AT
LEAST
I
HAVE
A
BETTER
OPTION
OF
GOING
TO
THE
CITY
COUNCIL
AND
SHOOTING
MY
MOUTH
OFF
ID
MUCH
RATHER
THE
MAJORITY
OF
LAWS
BE
MADE
BY
ACCESSIBLE
PEOPLE
WHO
HANG
AROUND
AND
END
UP
HAVING
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
THEM
RATHER
THAN
SOMEBODY
FAR
OFF
IN
WASHINGTON
WITH
HALF
A
MILLION
OR
MORE
CONSTITUENTS
IM
CURIOUS
WHAT
YOU
BASE
YOUR
ASSUMPTION
THAT
LOWER
LEVELS
ARE
MORE
CORRUPT
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
WHERE
ANY
RESTRICTIONS
IMPLIED
OR
OTHERWISE
WERE
PLACED
ON
THE
VETO
IT
COULD
JUST
AS
EASILY
HAVE
BEEN
READ
AS
A
MEANS
TO
PUT
A
CHECK
ON
DEMOCRATICALLY
POPULAR
BUT
UNWISE
IN
THE
EXECUTIVES
OPINION
POLICIES
SINCE
WE
WERE
ARGUING
FROM
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
I
WOULD
POINT
TO
THEM
PHILL
YOU
BROUGHT
UP
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
WE
WERE
ARGUING
THE
FILLIBUSTER
AND
WHETHER
OR
NOT
A
MINORITY
OF
SENATORS
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HOLD
UP
A
BILL
YOU
CLAIMED
THE
SENATE
WAS
SUPPOSE
TO
BE
A
FAR
LESS
POWERFUL
HOUSE
AND
I
CONTENDED
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
OR
OTHER
WRITINGS
WHICH
INDICATED
THIS
WHICH
WAS
WHEN
YOU
BROUGHT
UP
THAT
WE
CANT
DECIDE
WHAT
THE
FOUNDERS
WANTED
BASED
ON
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
YOU
ARGUED
AGAINST
THEM
I
NEVER
ARGUED
FROM
THEM
I
HAVE
PRIMARILY
REFERRED
TO
THE
CONSTITUTION
WHICH
PLACES
ONLY
VERY
SMALL
RESTRICTIONS
ON
THE
SENATE
THAN
FOR
THE
HOUSE
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
GIVES
ALMOST
NO
REASONING
AS
TO
HOW
IT
SHOULD
WORK
THE
ONLY
PART
WHERE
A
REASON
IS
GIVEN
IS
THE
RIGHT
TO
BEAR
ARMS
AMMENDMENT
WHERE
THE
WELL
REGULATED
MILITIA
JUSTIFICATION
IS
AMBIGUOUS
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
IS
A
NUTSANDBOLTS
DOCUMENT
THE
DELCARATION
OF
INDEPENDENCE
WAS
THE
HIGHBROW
REASONING
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
OTHER
EXAMPLES
THOUGH
SUCH
AS
THE
REASONING
FOR
THE
POWER
TO
TAX
AND
THE
REASONING
FOR
THE
POWER
TO
GRANT
PERMITS
BOTH
IN
ARTICLE
I
SECTION
THAT
THE
VETO
WAS
MEANT
TO
BE
AN
EXCEPTIONAL
MEASURE
FOLLOWS
FROM
THE
FACT
OF
THE
SENATE
IF
THE
PRESIDENT
WAS
MEANT
TO
REVISE
LEGISLATION
THEN
THERE
WOULD
BE
THREE
CHAMBERS
OF
THE
LEGISLATURE
NOT
TWO
FURTHERMORE
THE
SEPARATION
OF
POWERS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
LESS
DISTINCT
TO
A
CERTAIN
EXTEND
I
DO
BELIEVE
THE
VETO
HAS
BECOME
SOMETHING
IT
WASNT
INTENDED
HOWEVER
I
ALSO
BELIEVE
IT
IS
INEVITABLE
CONSIDERING
THE
CONGRESS
OWN
ABUSE
OF
THEIR
POWER
TO
MAKE
BILLS
SAY
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
THEM
TO
SAY
UNLIKE
MOST
PEOPLE
I
THINK
WE
SHOULDNT
BE
WORRYING
ABOUT
THE
VETO
WHICH
IS
FINE
BUT
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IN
CONGRESS
WHICH
ALMOST
NECESSITATES
ITS
ABUSE
THERE
IS
NO
LIMIT
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
TO
THE
PRESIDENTS
VETO
POWER
REGARDING
WHAT
A
BILL
IS
FOR
PREVIOUS
PRESIDENTS
HAVE
USED
THE
VETO
FOR
ANY
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
MOST
USUALLY
HAVING
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THEIR
AGENDA
I
AM
REALLY
CURIOUS
HOW
YOU
SINGLE
BUSH
OUT
AS
THE
PRESIDENT
WHO
ABUSED
VETOS
HE
HAS
THE
RECORD
FOR
VETOS
BUSH
PHILL
THATS
ABSURD
BUSH
HAD
VETOS
ONE
OF
WHICH
WAS
OVERRIDDEN
GO
READ
UP
ON
FDR
IF
YOU
THINK
THATS
ANYTHING
RESEMBLING
A
RECORD
WHY
IS
IT
NOT
A
REASONABLE
RESTRICTION
BECAUSE
SENATORS
IS
THE
MAGIC
HOLY
NUMBER
UPON
WHICH
LAWS
MUST
BE
BASED
IF
SENATORS
FEEL
SAFE
ENOUGH
WITH
THEIR
STATE
CONSTITUENCIES
TO
STAND
UP
AND
FILLIBUSTER
ISNT
THAT
ENOUGH
TO
INDICATE
THERES
A
SUFFICIENT
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHETHER
A
LAW
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
OR
NOT
TO
REEVALUATE
IT
UP
TO
A
POINT
THE
FACT
IS
THOUGH
THAT
WHEN
THE
MAJORITY
ARE
OPPOSED
BY
A
MINORITY
THE
MINORITY
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
WIN
BY
DEFAULT
WHY
NOT
WHAT
IS
INHERENTLY
WRONG
WITH
BIASING
THE
SYSTEM
AGAINST
ACTION
HISTORICALLY
GOVERNEMNT
ACTION
IN
THE
US
WHEN
DEALING
WITH
ISSUES
WITH
A
BARE
MINORITY
AND
A
LARGE
MINORITY
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
SUCCESSFUL
WHEN
YOURE
IN
A
POSITION
OF
IMPOSING
FEDERAL
POWER
ON
DIVERSE
PEOPLE
WHY
SHOULD
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
NOT
HAVE
TO
GOT
THROUGH
SOMETHING
MORE
THAN
A
BARE
MAJORITY
WHY
ONE
EARTH
SHOULD
BE
SUFFICIENT
TO
ENACT
A
LAW
WHICH
COVERS
MILLION
PEOPLE
IN
VERY
VERY
DIVERSE
PLACES
AND
LIVING
IN
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
CONDITIONS
WHY
SHOULDNT
A
SUPERMAJORITY
BE
REQUIRED
BECAUSE
THE
BILL
AT
ISSUE
IS
A
MONEY
BILL
RELATING
TO
A
SHORT
TERM
PROPOSAL
NOW
WERE
SWITCHING
FROM
A
GENERAL
QUESTION
OF
A
FILLIBUSTER
TO
A
SPECIFIC
BILL
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
IT
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
IT
IS
NOT
A
CHANGE
IN
THE
LAW
WHERE
A
PRESUPPOSITION
IN
FAVOUR
OF
THE
STATUS
QUO
IS
ARGUABLE
SURE
ITS
ARGUABLE
THEYRE
ARGUING
IT
HOWEVER
REQUIRING
TO
BRING
IT
TO
A
VOTE
ENSURES
THAT
THEYLL
HAVE
TO
HAVE
A
GOOD
ARGUMENT
SOMETHING
THAT
ISNT
BASED
SOLELY
ON
PARTY
LINES
ANY
SYSTEM
IN
WHICH
THE
SIMPLE
MAJORITY
IS
GIVEN
ABSOLUTE
POWER
TO
IGNORE
THE
MINORITY
THEN
THE
MINORITY
WILL
BE
IGNORED
I
DO

THE

SO
INSTEAD
YOU
CONSIDER
A
SYSTEM
UNDER
WHICH
THE
MINORITY
AUTOMATICALLY
WIN
TO
BE
SUPERIOR
NO
I
AM
COMPLETELY
HAPPY
WITH
A
SYSTEM
WHICH
REQUIRES
A
MINORITY
FOR
ACTION
SINCE
US
HISTORY
IS
A
HISTORY
OF
CARVING
UP
POPULATION
GROUPS
AND
IMPLEMENTING
PIECEMEAL
ON
MINORITIES
I
FEEL
MINORITIES
SHOULD
HAVE
SUFFICENT
CLOUT
TO
PREVENT
ACTION
THEY
FEEL
STRONGLY
ENOUGH
ABOUT
AND
IS
HARDLY
A
TINY
MINORITY
I
DONT
ADVOCATE
THE
MINORITY
BEING
CAPABLE
OF
INITIATING
ACTIONM
BUT
I
SEE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
BIASING
THE
FEDERAL
SYSTEM
AGAINST
ACTION
