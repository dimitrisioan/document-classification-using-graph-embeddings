we
already
kill
people
death
penalty
and
that
costs
even
more
money
so
you
could
as
well
complain
about
this
extremely
barbaric
way
of
justice
but
the
death
penalty
is
right
and
how
expensive
can
an
execution
be
i
mean
i
think
rope
cyanide
for
the
gas
or
the
rifles
and
ammunition
to
arm
firing
squads
are
affordable
now
perhaps
lethal
injection
might
be
expensive
in
that
case
lets
return
to
the
more
efficient
methods
employed
in
the
past
oh
sure
the
death
penalty
is
fairly
inexpensive
but
the
trial
and
sentencing
can
run
millions
strychnine
unless
you
wanna
cut
costs
by
skipping
the
trial
and
sentencing
you
murderous
little
ratbastard
why
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
thinking
of
that
as
a
way
to
make
the
system
more
efficient
and
the
only
murderous
ratbastards
are
aboritionists
yeah
simons
no
ratbastard
hes
the
