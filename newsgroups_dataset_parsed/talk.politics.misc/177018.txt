WE
ALREADY
KILL
PEOPLE
DEATH
PENALTY
AND
THAT
COSTS
EVEN
MORE
MONEY
SO
YOU
COULD
AS
WELL
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THIS
EXTREMELY
BARBARIC
WAY
OF
JUSTICE
BUT
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
IS
RIGHT
AND
HOW
EXPENSIVE
CAN
AN
EXECUTION
BE
I
MEAN
I
THINK
ROPE
CYANIDE
FOR
THE

CAN
RUN
MILLIONS
STRYCHNINE
UNLESS
YOU
WANNA

WHY
AS
A
MATTER
OF

I
WAS
THINKING
OF
THAT
AS
A
WAY
TO
MAKE
THE
SYSTEM
MORE
EFFICIENT
AND
THE
ONLY
MURDEROUS
RATBASTARDS
ARE
ABORITIONISTS
