THIS
WAS
IN

START
THE
WHITE

TO
MOUNT
PUBLIC
PRESSURE
ON
GOP
SENATORS
BOMBARDED
NEWS
OUTLETS
IN
SOME
SENATORS
HOME
STATES
WITH
NEWS
RELEASES
WARNING
THAT
CERTAIN
PROJECTS
MAY
NOT
BE
FUNDED
IF
THE
STIMULUS
BILL
ISNT
PASSED
NONE
OF
THE
PROJECTS
MENTIONED
ARE
ACTUALLY
IN
THE
BILL
RATHER
THEY
ARE
PART
OF
A
WISH
LIST
THAT
MAY
BE
FUNDED
FROM
THE
BILLION
IN
COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT
BLOCK
GRANTS
END
I
COULD
HAVE
SWORN
I
HEARD
A
BUNCH
OF
CLINTONITES
GOING
ON
AND
ON
RAVING
ABOUT
HOW
DISHONEST
IT
WAS
THAT
THE
REBUBLICANS
WERE
TAKING
ITEMS
FROM
THIS
WISH
LIST
IN
ORDER
TO
RIDICULE
THIS
BILL
NOW
THAT
CLINTON
IS
USING
THAT
SAME
LIST
IN
ORDER
TO
GARNER
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
BILL
ARE
YOU
GUYS
GOING
TO
DO
THE
HONORABLE
THING
AND
SAY
THAT
CLINTON
IS
BEING
DISHONEST
AS
ONE
OF
THE
CLINTONITES
CITED
ABOVE
ILL
TRY
TO
CLARIFY
SINCE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
CASE
OF
CLINTONS
DISHONESTY
I
WONT
NECESSARILY
DEFEND
HIM
ON
OTHER
ISSUES
THERE
WERE
NEVER
ANY
SPECIFIC
PROJECTS
INCLUDED
IN
THE
COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT
BLOCK
GRANT
PORTION
OF
THE
PRESIDENTS
PROPOSAL
CONGRESSIONAL
REPUBLICANS
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
DISCREDIT
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
SELECTED
WHAT
THEY
FELT
WERE
SILLY
SOUNDING
PROJECTS
FROM
A
WISHLIST
OF
POTENTIAL
PROJECTS
PREPARED
BY
THE
US
MAYORS
CONFERENCE
BEFORE
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
WAS
EVER
PROPOSED
THE
DOCUMENT
IN
QUESTION
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
PRESSURE
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
TO
INCREASE
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
BLOCK
GRANT
PROPOSAL
SUBMITTED
TO
CONGRESS
IT
DIDNT
WORK
THE
BILLION
PROPOSED
IN
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
CAME
NOWHERE
CLOSE
TO
COVERING
THE
TOTAL
ESTIMATED
COST
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
WISHLIST
IF
IT
WERE
PASSED
COMMUNITIES
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SELECT
WHICH
PROJECTS
TO
FUND
AND
AT
WHAT
LEVEL
IN
THE
CASE
OF
SPOKANE
WA
TOM
FOLEYS
HOME
DISTRICT
NO
ONE
EVER
EXPECTED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
REFURBISH
A
LOCAL
SWIMMING
POOL
ONE
OF
THE
REPUBLICANS
EXAMPLES
FROM
THE
FUNDS
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
SINCE
THE
ESTIMATED
COST
OF
DOING
SO
EXCEEDED
THE
TOTAL
AMOUNT
OF
BLOCK
GRANT
FUNDS
THE
CITY
WOULD
RECEIVE
FROM
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
FOR
ALL
PROJECTS
THE
PLAN
INSTEAD
WAS
TO
USE
THE
MONEY
ON
PUBLIC
HOUSING
CONSTRUCTION
AND
REMODELING
TO
COPE
WITH
A
SEVERE
HOUSING
SHORTAGE
YUP
THERE
ARE
PLACES
WHERE
THAT
IS
TRUE
THE
SWIMMING
POOL
IMPROVEMENTS
WERE
NEAR
THE
BOTTOM
OF
A
LONG
LIST
OF
PRIORITIES
PREPARED
BY
THE
CITY
THE
MILLION
OR
SO
TO
BE
RECEIVED
WOULD
COVER
ONLY
A
FEW
OF
THE
MOST
PRESSING
PRIORITIES
IF
THE
BLOCK
GRANTS
ARE
CUT
FROM
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
IT
IS
THESE
PROJECTS
THAT
WILL
BE
AFFECTED
BY
THE
LACK
OF
FUNDS
AND
THAT
IS
WHY
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
BEEN
PUBLICIZING
THE
ISSUE
A
FINAL
POINT
ONE
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
LIKE
COMMUNITY
BLOCK
GRANTS
IT
IS
WORTH
NOTING
HOWEVER
THAT
CONGRESSIONAL
REPUBLICANS
OPPOSITION
TO
THEM
IS
NEW
SINCE
THE
NIXON
ADMINISTRATION
REPUBLICANS
HAVE
GENERALLY
SUPPORTED
SUCH
GRANTS
AS
AN
ALTERNATIVE
TO
TARGETED
FEDERAL
SPENDING
ARGUING
THAT
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
ARE
FAR
BETTER
ABLE
TO
DETERMINE
SPENDING
PRIORITIES
THAN
WASHINGTON
BUREAUCRATS
IS
IT
CLEAR
NOW
OR
IS
THIS
ALL
TOO
COMPLICATED
TO
UNDERSTAND
