they
used

nontoxic
tear
gas
do
you
know
what
tear
gas
is
i
do
once
upon
a
time
i
happened
to
be
in
a
room
when
someone
threw
a
teargas
grenade
in
that
was
supposed
to
be
a
joke
the
sensation
was
incredible
i
felt
my
eyes
and
nostrils
were
being
torn
apart
i
remember
us
a
bunch
of
young
men
in
our
early
running
out
like
a
herd
of
wild
animals
knocking
down
the
door
and
jumping
out
of
the
windows
thank
gd
we
were
on
the
first
floor
i
cant
imagine
this
kind
of
stuff
being
used
against
children
for
them
the
worst
effect
might
not
be
the
physical
effects
so
much
as
the
psychological
effect
of
being
incapacitated
without
fully
understanding
the
cause
many
years
ago
i
was
accidentally
exposed
to
a
tiny
dose
of
tear
gas
it
was
in
athens
on
the
street
leading
to
the
american
embassy
thered
been
a
march
that
had
been
broken
up
with
teargas
i
must
have
stumbled
into
a
remaining
patch
of
gas
the
next
day
aside
from
the
tears
feeling
sick
to
my
stomach
etc
the
really
horrible
psychological
effect
was
that
of
suddenly
falling
to
pieces
and
not
knowing
why
it
had
happenedi
was
horrified
and
wondered
what
disease
or
other
health
problem
i
had
i
didnt
find
out
about
the
march
and
the
teargas
till
hours
later
i
can
imagine
how
horribly
disorienting
this
might
be
to
very
young
children
suddenly
crying
uncontrollably
and
feeling
sick
weak
and
out
of
control
of
your
bodyand
not
knowing
the
cause
this
gives
us
a
chance
to
try
the
gas
of
peace
yeah
right
