RE
RODNEY
KING
TRIAL
CIVIL
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
IN
ARTICLE
MWILSONNCRATLATLANTAGANCRCOM
MARK
WILSON
WRITES
IN
DAVID
SPANAGEL
WRITES
FURTHERMORE
WHAT
ARE
THE
SPECIFIC
CHARGES
AGAINST
THE
FOUR
LAPD
OFFICERS
WHICH
CIVIL
RIGHTS
OR
LAWS
ARE
THEY
ACCUSED
OF
VIOLATING
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
A
GENERAL
CHARGE
THAT
IS
NO
SPECIFIC
RIGHT
IS
MENTIONED
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
ACCURATE
I
BELIEVE
AND
COULD
BE
WRONG
THAT
THERE
IS
A
SPECIFIC
RIGHT
ALLEGEDLY
TO
HAVE
BEEN
VIOLATED
LIKE
THE
OR
DUE
PROCESS
OR
WHATEVER
WHAT
ABOUT
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
HAS
THERE
BEEN
ANY
CONCERN
THAT
A
VERDICT
AGAINST
KOON
ET
AL
MIGHT
BE
OVERTURNED
UPON
APPEAL
BECAUSE
THEYRE
BEING
TRIED
AGAIN
FOR
THE
SAME
ACTIONS
I
THOUGHT
I
HEARD
SOMETHING
ON
THE
NEWS
ABOUT
THIS
THE
SS
HAS
PREVIOUSLY
RULED
THAT
SINCE
THE
SEPERATE
GOVERNMENTS
WERE
IN
ESSENCE
SEPERATE
SOVEREIGNS
THEN
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
DOES
NOT
APPLY
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
THEN
COULD
DEFENDENTS
ALSO
BE
TRIED
UNDER
CITY
AND
COUNTY
GOVERNMENTS
THIS
MORNINGS
PAPER
SAID
THAT
THE
ACLU
HAS
DECIDED
TO
REINSTATE
ITS
OPPOSITION
TO
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
THEY
HAD
EARLIER
SUSPENDED
THEIR
OPPOSITION
WHILE
THEY
EXAMINED
THE
KING
CASE
THERE
MIGHT
BE
HOPE
FOR
THE
ACLU
AFTER
ALL
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
DOES
NOT
APPLY
BUT
NOT
FOR
THE
REASONS
YOU
QUOTE
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
STATES
THAT
A
PERSON
MAY
NOT
BE
TRIED
TWICE
ON
THE
SAME
CHARGE
HOWEVER
THE
POLICE
ARE
NOT
ON
TRIAL
FOR
THE
CRIME
OF
EXCESSIVE
FORCE
OR
ASSAULT
THEY
ARE
NOW
ON
TRIAL
FOR
THE
DIFFERENT
CRIME
OF
VIOLATING
MR
KINGS
CIVIL
RIGHTS
AS
FOR
THE
CITY
AND
COUNTY
OR
STATE
TRYING
YOU
MORE
THAN
ONCE
IT
MOST
LIKELY
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
CITIES
AND
STATES
HAVE
SEPARATE
LAWS
GOVERNING
BEHAVIOUR
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
SOME
STATES
IT
IS
AN
OFFENCE
TO
CARRY
MARIJUANA
BUT
NOT
A
CITY
OFFENCE
ALSO
I
THINK
MURDER
IS
AGAINST
FEDERAL
BUT
NOT
SOME
STATE
LAWS
AND
MY
MIND
WAS
FILLED
WITH
WONDER
WHEN
THE
EVENING
HEADLINES
READ
RICHARD
CORY
WENT
HOME
LAST
NIGHT
AND
PUT
A
BULLET
THROUGH
HIS
HEAD
