i
certainly
hope
you
dont
have
an
so
sir
what
is
so
supposed
to
signify
i
prefer
the
companionship
of
a
person
not
a
euphemism
because
if
she
heard
thankfully
you
got
the
gender
right
for
i
am
not
a
deviant
how
disparaging
you
are
towards
political
minorities
sexual
deviants
do
not
comprise
a
political
minority
and
if
she
had
any
shred
of
selfrespect
shed
be
out
the
door
i
only
associate
with
girls
who
do
indeed
have
selfrespect
but
were
i
to
find
myself
with
the
sort
who
would
be
inclined
to
head
out
the
door
on
account
of
my
views
regarding
the
aberrant
behavior
known
as
homosexuality
i
would
encourage
her
to
indeed
do
so
and
i
would
further
advise
her
not
to
let
the
door
whack
her
on
the
backside
on
the
way
out
who
needs
such
an
airhead
pretty
soon
they
will
find
themselves
retreating
back
into
the
closet
where
they
belong
dont
count
on
it
sweetheart
oh
i
cant
do
anything
but
count
on
it
after
all
it
is
inevitable
for
it
is
part
of
the
natural
order
of
things
throughout
history
nature
has
always
asserted
itself
dont
be
so
arrogant
as
to
assume
that
this
foolish
and
misguided
generation
can
change
the
nature
of
man
where
practically
every
other
generation
has
failed
greater
men
than
you
havent
been
able
to
do
this
the
above
most
certainly
will
happen
no
matter
how
much
you
may
wish
to
pretend
otherwise
moreover
im
not
your
sweetheart
the
views
expressed
herein
are
theodore
a
kaldis
my
own
only
do
you
seriously
kaldisremusrutgersedu
believe
that
a
major
university
rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
as
this
would
hold
such
views
