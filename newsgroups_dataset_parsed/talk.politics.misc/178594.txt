re
foreign
media
reaction
april
part
of
phill
hallambaker
hallamdscomsadesyde
wrote
first
off
they
could
recognise
iraqus
responsibility
in
initiating
the
iraniraq
war
providing
technical
assistance
to
iran
to
get
its
oil
production
back
up
to
capacity
would
also
be
a
smart
move
at
the
moment
iran
is
above
its
opec
ceiling
if
they
had
extra
capacity
they
would
use
it
and
bring
down
the
oild
price
further
which
is
in
our
interests
i
agree
with
most
of
what
phill
says
except
the
point
about
it
being
in
our
interests
to
bring
down
the
oil
price
consider
that
both
the
us
and
great
britain
have
domestic
sources
to
partly
satisfy
their
energy
needs
pricy
opec
oil
impacts
both
germany
japan
and
many
other
industrial
rivals
more
than
these
two
in
addition
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
especially
by
saudi
arabia
kuwait
uae
etc
are
disproportionately
reinvested
in
the
us
and
gb
propping
up
these
economies
and
further
providing
an
incentive
to
keep
prices
from
falling
too
low
