RE
RODNEY
KING
TRIAL
CIVIL
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
IN
DAVID
SPANAGEL
WRITES
RECENTLY
ITS
OCCURED
TO
ME
THAT
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
ANY
PERSON
EVER
BEING
TRIED
IN
FEDERAL
COURT
FOR
VIOLATING
SOMEONES
CIVIL
RIGHTS
OF
COURSE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
CASES
BEFORE
THE
SUPREME
COURT
IN
WHICH
IT
WAS
DECIDED
THAT
SOMEONES
CIVIL
RIGHTS
HAD
BEEN
VIOLATED
EG
MIRANDA
ESCOBEDO
ETC
BUT
INSTITUTIONS
WERE
DE
FACTO
THE
DEFENDANTS
NOT
INDIVIDUALS
AM
I
MISTAKEN
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
SIMILAR
CASES
AGAINST
INDIVIDUALS
IN
THE
PAST
I
KNOW
IT
WAS
USED
SEVERAL
TIMES
IN
THE
SOUTH
TO
PROSECUTE
THE
MURDERS
OF
BLACKS
AFTER
ALL
WHITE
JURIES
HAD
CLEARED
THE
ACCUSSED
FURTHERMORE
WHAT
ARE
THE
SPECIFIC
CHARGES
AGAINST
THE
FOUR
LAPD
OFFICERS
WHICH
CIVIL
RIGHTS
OR
LAWS
ARE
THEY
ACCUSED
OF
VIOLATING
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
A
GENERAL
CHARGE
THAT
IS
NO
SPECIFIC
RIGHT
IS
MENTIONED
WHAT
ABOUT
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
HAS
THERE
BEEN
ANY
CONCERN
THAT
A
VERDICT
AGAINST
KOON
ET
AL
MIGHT
BE
OVERTURNED
UPON
APPEAL
BECAUSE
THEYRE
BEING
TRIED
AGAIN
FOR
THE
SAME
ACTIONS
I
THOUGHT
I
HEARD
SOMETHING
ON
THE
NEWS
ABOUT
THIS
THE
SS
HAS
PREVIOUSLY
RULED
THAT
SINCE
THE
SEPERATE
GOVERNMENTS
WERE
IN
ESSENCE
SEPERATE
SOVEREIGNS
THEN
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
DOES
NOT
APPLY
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
THEN
COULD
DEFENDENTS
ALSO
BE
TRIED
UNDER
CITY
AND
COUNTY
GOVERNMENTS
THIS
MORNINGS
PAPER
SAID
THAT
THE
ACLU
HAS
DECIDED
TO
REINSTATE
ITS
OPPOSITION
TO
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
THEY
HAD
EARLIER
SUSPENDED
THEIR
OPPOSITION
WHILE
THEY
EXAMINED
THE
KING
CASE
THERE
MIGHT
BE
HOPE
FOR
THE
ACLU
AFTER
ALL
MOB
RULE
ISNT
ANY
PRETTIER
MERELY
BECAUSE
THE
MOB
CALLS
ITSELF
A
GOVERNMENT
IT
AINT
CHARITY
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
SOMEONE
ELSES
MONEY
WILSONS
THEORY
OF
RELATIVITY
IF
YOU
GO
BACK
FAR
ENOUGH
WERE
