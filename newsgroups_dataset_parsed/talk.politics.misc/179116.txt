janet
reno
killed
the
waco
children
she
is
responsible
for
their
deaths
she
should
resign
immediately
she
should
have
understood
that
david
koresh
was
a
madman
who
would
do
anything
against
the
children
if
he
became
provoked
all
the
warning
signs
were
there
and
she
ignored
them
she
provoked
koresh
into
killing
the
children
janet
reno
the
fbi
et
al
were
nothing
but
pawns
in
koreshs
game
he
was
a
madman
who
was
going
to
hurt
the
children
and
everyone
else
in
the
compound
no
matter
what
the
fbi
did
the
situation
in
waco
was
similar
to
a
hostage
situation
with
a
madman
holding
a
gun
against
the
head
of
an
innocent
person
in
such
a
situation
a
person
who
provokes
the
madman
and
causes
him
to
pull
the
guns
trigger
is
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
hostage
janet
reno
blindly
stumbled
in
there
and
basically
threw
a
tear
gas
container
at
the
madman
hoping
that
he
would
release
the
hostage
its
no
surprise
that
the
madman
would
pull
the
trigger
in
response
to
that
kind
of
provocation
such
a
hostage
situation
has
taken
place
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
result
of
the
police
trying
to
take
the
place
by
force
and
the
result
being
the
death
of
the
hostages
and
the
gunmen
however
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
the
blame
landing
squarely
on
the
police
in
this
country
we
have
a
policy
of
not
negotiating
a
back
down
from
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
since
that
only
encourages
other
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
