AND
EVERYONE
ELSE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE

DID
THE
SITUATION
IN
WACO
WAS
SIMILAR
TO
A
HOSTAGE
SITUATION
WITH
A
MADMAN
HOLDING
A
GUN
AGAINST
THE
HEAD
OF
AN
INNOCENT
PERSON
IN
SUCH
A
SITUATION
A

THE
DEATH
OF

BLINDLY
STUMBLED
IN
THERE
AND
BASICALLY
THREW
A
TEAR
GAS
CONTAINER
AT
THE

HOPING
THAT
HE
WOULD
RELEASE
THE

ITS
NO
SURPRISE
THAT
THE

WOULD
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
IN
RESPONSE
TO
THAT
KIND
OF
PROVOCATION
SUCH
A
HOSTAGE
SITUATION
HAS
TAKEN
PLACE
ON
NUMEROUS
OCCASIONS
WITH
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
POLICE
TRYING
TO
TAKE
THE
PLACE
BY
FORCE
AND
THE
RESULT
BEING
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
HOSTAGES
AND
THE
GUNMEN
HOWEVER
THIS

THE
FIRST
TIME
IVE
HEARD
OF
THE
BLAME
LANDING
SQUARELY
ON
THE
POLICE
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
WE
HAVE
A
POLICY
OF
NOT
NEGOTIATING
A
BACK
DOWN
FROM
TERRORISTS
AND
HOSTAGE
TAKERS
SINCE
THAT
ONLY
ENCOURAGES
OTHER
TERRORISTS
AND
HOSTAGE
TAKERS
