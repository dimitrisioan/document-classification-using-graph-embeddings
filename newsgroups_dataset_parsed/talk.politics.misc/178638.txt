WRITES
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
WANT
GUN
CONTROL
MUST
OBVIOUSLY
DISCOUNT
THE
ENTIRE
GOVERNMENT
STORY
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
RATIONALISATION
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
TO
SIMPLY
DISMISS
THE
GOVERNMENT
AS
INCOMPETENT
THAT
WOULD
REQUIRE
THEM
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
SOLUTION
THEMSELVES
INSTEAD
THEY
HAVE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
GOVERNMENT
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
WHEREBY
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECIDED
TO
SET
OUT
TO
MURDER
PEOPLE
JUST
TO
SET
UP
SOME
SORT
OF
SCARE
TO
ALOW
THEM
TO
GET
GUN
CONTROL
LEGISLATION
THROUGH
WHATS
DESPICABLE
IS
THAT
THIS
SORDID
INCIDENT
IS
BEING
GLOMMED
ONTO
BY
ALL
SORTS
OF
PEOPLE
DESPERATELY
TRYING
TO
GET
A
REVOLUTION
IT
MAKES
AMBULANCE
CHASING
BY
LAWYERS
SEEM
LIKE
A
HARMLESS
PASTIME
FOR
THE
LAST
FEW
MONTHS
BENIGHTED
SOULS
HAVE
BEEN
CALLING
CSPAN
ON
ISSUES
AS
MUNDANE
AS
BUDGET
RESOLUTIONS
SAYING
THAT
I
DONT
KNOW
I
JUST
HAVE
THE
FEELING
THERE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
A
REVOLUTION
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
SO
ON
GET

THEN
THE
REVOLUTION
NEVER
DID
COME
AND
WACO
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THE
SPARK
OF
THE
END
TIMES
IN
THE
TAPE
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
THE
WAY
THE
WEATHERPERSONS
DANCE
AROUND
THE
ISSUE
OF
ONE
OF
THEIR
DEFINING
MOMENTS
WHICH
WAS
WHEN
A
FEW
OF
THEIR
COMRADES
MANAGED
TO
BLOW
THEMSELVES
UP
MANUFACTURING
BOMBS
IN
A
GREENWICH
VILLAGE
TOWNHOUSE
THE
PROBLEM
ONE
OF
THEM
SAID
WAS
THAT
THEY
WERE
SO
CAUGHT
UP
IN
THEIR
ARMED
STRUGGLE
THAT
THEY
FORGOT
ABOUT
THEIR
OWN
PERSONAL
SAFETY
AND
WERENT
CAREFUL
BUT
OF
COURSE
THAT
WAS
SOCIETYS
FAULT
A
SOCIETY
THAT
DIDNT
INSTILL
A
SENSE
OF
WORTH
IN
THE
PEOPLE
SO
THEY
NEGLECT
THEIR
OWN
SAFETY
CURRENT
APOLOGISTS

IMPORTANT
RATIONALIZATION
