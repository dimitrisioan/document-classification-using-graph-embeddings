RE
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
IN
ARTICLE
PAUL
BARTHOLOMEW
WRITES
A
VERY
WELL
PUT
TOGETHER
POST
I
DISAGREE
WITH
SEVERAL
KEY
POINTS
BUT
THE
POST
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
ONE
WITH
WHICH
TO
ENGAGE
IN
DISCOURSE
THERE
HAS
BEEN
MUCH
DISCUSSION
RECENTLY
ABOUT
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
MR
CRAMER
AND
MR
RONZONE
APPEAR
TO
TAKE
AN
ABSOLUTIST
POSITION
ON
THIS
RIGHTTHAT
IT
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHT
PERHAPS
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHT
AND
THAT
IT
SUPERSEDES
OTHER
RIGHTS
SUCH
AS
THE
RIGHT
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
OTHERS
FEEL
THAT
A
RIGHT
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
OUTWEIGHS
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
AND
THUS
WE
HAVE
THE
NEVERENDING
DEBATE
THAT
FLARES
UP
REPEATEDLY
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
FOA
INVOLVES
THE
MUTUAL
AND
VOLUNTARY
AGREEMENT
OF
TWO
OR
MORE
PEOPLE
RIGHT
TO
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
LETS
CALL
IT
REO
INVOLVES
COERCION
IN
ALL
CASES
BY
DEFINITION
A
MAJOR
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
NEITHER
OF
THESE
RIGHTS
ARE
EXPLICITLY
DECLARED
OR
PROTECTED
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
OR
IN
THE
DECLARATION
OF
INDEPENDENCE
ALTHOUGH
BOTH
CAN
BE
DERIVED
FROM
THESE
DOCUMENTS
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
DEBATE
WILL
NEVER
END
BECAUSE
NEITHER
SIDE
CAN
CONCLU
SIVELY
PROVE
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THEIR
VIEWIT
BECOMES
SOLELY
A
MATTER
OF
PERSONAL
PHILOSOPHY
YES
THERE
IS
MUCH
DEBATE
BUT
NO
IT
CAN
END
WITH
ONCE
AND
FOR
ALL
RECOGNITION
OF
THESE
RIGHTS
WELL
NOT
TOTALLY
PERFECT
END
BUT
END
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
WORLDWIDE
DISAGREEMENT
THAT
SAY
MURDER
IS
A
CRIME
MY
PERSONAL
OPINION
IS
THAT
THE
REAL
ANSWER
LIES
SOMEWHERE
IN
BETWEEN
I
REGARD
BOTH
OF
THESE
RIGHTS
AS
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHTS
WHICH
UNFORTU
NATELY
COME
INTO
DIRECT
CONFLICT
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
WHICH
IS
STRONGER
DEPENDS
ON
THE
GIVEN
SITUATION
HMM
THERE
IS
EVEN
MORE
DISCUSION
ABOUT
RELIGION
SHOULD
WE
TAKE
A
SOMEWHERE
IN
BETWEEN
APPROACH
TOWARDS
THE
STATE
A
STATE
RECOGNIZED
RELIGION
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
IS
SO
UH
SO
ABSOLUTIST
YOU
KNOW
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
THE
OWNER
OF
A
MOMANDPOP
STORE
WISHES
TO
HIRE
AN
EMPLOYEE
TO
HELP
OUT
THEIR
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
OUTWEIGHS
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THEIR
JOB
APPLICANTS
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
THEY
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
HIRE
WHOMEVER
THEY
CHOOSE
USING
WHATEVER
CRITERIA
THEY
CHOOSE
WITHOUT
ANY
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
AT
ALL
SIMILARLY
IF
A
FAMILY
WISHES
TO
RENT
OUT
A
BEDROOM
IN
THEIR
HOME
OR
A
GARAGE
APARTMENT
OR
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
THEN
THEIR
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
OUTWEIGHS
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THEIR
PROSPECTIVE
TENANTS
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
IF
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IBM
A
MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATION
WITH
EMPLOYEES
PUBLICLY
OWNED
AND
OPERATED
BY
A
BOARD
OF
DIRECTORS
WISHES
TO
HIRE
ADDITIONAL
EMPLOYEES
THEN
WHOSE
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
ARE
WE
PROTECTING
THE
BOARD
OF
DIRECTORS
THE
OTHER
EMPLOYEES
THE
OWNERS
OF
THE
STOCK
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
APPLICANTS
RIGHT
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
OUTWEIGHS
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
AND
WE
AS
A
SOCIETY
CAN
ASK
IBM
TO
USE
ONLY
THOSE
CRITERIA
WHICH
ARE
RELEVANT
TO
THE
SPECIFIC
TASK
WHY
SAYS
WHO
WHY
CAN
MON
POP
HAVE
FOA
BUT
IBM
BE
FORCED
AND
FORCE
IS
THE
CORRECT
WORD
HERE
TO
HAVE
REO
AS
PURCHASE
OF
IBM
IS
VOLUNTARY
THEN
THERE
ARE
VERY
WELL
DEFINED
PROCEDURES
ON
HOW
IBM
CHOOSES
TO
DO
SOME
THINGS
AND
CHOOSES
TO
DO
OTHER
THINGS
WHY
NOT
LET
THOSE
SAME
PROCEDURES
WORK
FOR
EMPLOYMENT
POLICIES
SIMILARLY
IF
A
LANDLORD
OWNS
A
NUMBER
OF
APARTMENT
BUILDINGS
IN
WHICH
HE
DOES
NOT
LIVE
AND
WHICH
ARE
MANAGED
BY
AN
INDEPENDENT
MANAGEMENT
AGENCY
THEN
WHOSE
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
ARE
WE
PROTECTING
IF
THE
OWNER
DOES
NOT
LIVE
IN
HIS
BUILDINGS
AND
HAS
NO
CONTACT
WITH
HIS
TENANTS
THEN
THE
PROSPECTIVE
TENANTS
RIGHT
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
OUTWEIGHS
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
AND
WE
AS
A
SOCIETY
CAN
ASK
THE
OWNER
TO
USE
ONLY
THOSE
CRITERIA
WHICH
ARE
RELEVANT
TO
GOOD
TENANTS
IVE
PUT
GOOD
IN
QUOTATION
MARKS
BECAUSE
I
REALLY
DONT
WANT
TO
BE
DRAWN
OFF
INTO
THE
SIDE
ISSUE
OF
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
A
GOOD
TENANT
WHY
DOES
THIS
TENANT
HAVE
AN
OPTION
I
WONT
CALL
IT
A
RIGHT
TO
DESTROY
THE
FOA
OF
THE
LANDLORD
IF
THE
LANDLORD
AND
THE
TENANT
CANT
AGREE
THEN
THEY
BOTH
CAN
CEASE
FROM
USING
EACH
OTHERS
PROPERTY
SUDDENLY
BY
ARM
WAVING
BY
MAGIC
A
LANDLORD
DOES
NOT
HAVE
FOA
AND
ON
WHAT
BASIS
DOES
THE
FOA
OF
THE
LANDLORD
DISAPPEAR
IT
SEEMS
THAT
VAGUE
TERMS
LIKE
NO
CONTACT
WITH
TENANTS
SUFFICE
WELL
I
THINK
FOA
IS
ONE
OUR
MOST
IMPORTANT
RIGHTTS
IN
THE
TOP
AND
BY
GOLLY
IF
THE
STATE
IS
GOING
TO
MAKE
IT
SUFFER
I
SURE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
THE
HEINOUS
CRIME
THAT
JUSTIFIES
THE
REMOVAL
OF
THIS
RIGHT
I
DONT
THINK
NO
CONTACT
WITH
THE
TENATS
IS
EVEN
A
CRIME
MUCH
LESS
SOMETHING
THAT
SHOULD
CAUSE
SEVERE
INTERFERENCE
WITH
IMPORTANT
RIGHTS
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AGREE
WITH
MY
POSITION
ON
THESE
EXTREME
CASES
PARTICULARLY
IF
THEY
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
THIS
MANNER
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
MR
RONZONE
OR
MR
CRAMER
WOULD
AGREEI
SUSPECT
NOT
IN
ANY
CASE
ADDITIONAL
PROBLEMS
ARISE
WHEN
WE
TRY
TO
APPLY
GUIDELINES
FOR
THE
MIDDLE
GROUND
WHAT
IF
THE
COMPANY
HAS
EMPLOYEES
OR
OR
WHERE
DO
WE
DRAW
THE
LINE
BETWEEN
PROTECTING
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
AND
PROTECTING
THE
RIGHT
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
DEFINED
BY
MAJORITYMOB
CHOICE
FOA
IS
AN
ABSOLUTE
REO
IS
A
FANCY
NAME
FOR
THUGGERY
FOR
RACISM
AND
COERCION
THE
DIFFICULTY
IS
THAT
ANY
LINE
WE
DRAW
WILL
OF
NECESSITY
BE
ARTIFICIAL
AND
ANY
LEGISLATION
RESULTING
WILL
BE
FLAWED
IN
THE
PAST
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
USUALLY
TRIED
TO
PASS
LAWS
WHICH
REFERRED
TO
THE
NUMBER
OF
EMPLOYEES
HIRED
BY
THE
COMPANYEG
ANY
COMPANY
WITH
MORE
THAN
XXX
EMPLOYEES
WAS
AFFECTED
BY
THE
LAW
THOSE
WITH
FEWER
WERE
UNAFFECTED
OF
COURSE
IT
WOULD
BE
YOU
DIMLY
SEE
THAT
THE
LINE
MUST
BE
ARTIFIACIAL
BECAUSE
FOA
IS
THE
ONLY
RIGHT
JUST
LIKE
A
STATE
RELIGION
YOU
CANT
JSUTIFY
THAT
EITHER
GENERALLY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
REGULATIONS
AFFECTING
THESE
RIGHTS
THEN
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
WILL
BE
STRONGER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MANY
OF
THE
REGULATIONS
PROTECT
THE
RIGHT
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
TOO
MUCH
WEAKENING
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
A
SATISFACTORY
SOLUTION
WHICH
WILL
PLEASE
EVERYBODY
A
SOLUTION
THAT
I
CAME
UP
WITH
IS
TO
USE
PUBLICLY
OWNED
VS
PRIVATELY
OWNED
AS
THE
DIVIDING
LINE
IF
THE
COMPANY
REMAINS
PRIVATELY
OWNED
THEN
THE
OWNERS
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
DO
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
WITH
THEIR
COMPANY
IF
THE
COMPANY
BECOMES
PUBLICLY
OWNED
THEN
THE
PUBLIC
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
ASK
THE
COMPANY
TO
SUBMIT
TO
ADDITIONAL
REGULATION
WHY
I
ASSUME
THAT
WHEN
YOU
SAY
PUBLICLY
OWNED
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THOSE
QUASISTATE
COMPANYS
THAT
DO
NOT
HAVE
SHAREHOLDERS
THE
COMPANIES
ON
THE
FORTUNE
FOR
EXAMPLE
ARE
ALL
PRIVATELY
OWNED
THEY
CAN
GIVE
YOU
A
LIST
OF
ALL
OF
THEIR
OWNERS
THEY
HAVE
NO
ANONYMOUS
UNKNOWN
TO
THEM
OWNERS
BY
THE
WAY
THE
ABOVE
ANALYSIS
IS
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
AND
THE
RIGHT
TO
AN
EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY
ARE
BOTH
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHTS
OF
EQUAL
IMPORTANCE
SINCE
THIS
IS
ENTIRELY
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
ANY
PROOF
I
DO
NOT
CHOOSE
TO
EVEN
TRY
TO
ESTABLISH
THIS
YOU
EITHER
ACCEPT
IT
OR
YOU
DONT
ANY
COMMENTS
FOA
CAN
BE
DERIVED
BY
ANY
TWO
RATIONAL
PEOPLE
ON
A
BASIS
THAT
NEITHER
HAS
EVIL
MALICIOUS
OR
MURDEROUS
INTENT
TOWARDS
THE
OTHERS
IN
SHORT
AGREEMENT
IS
MUTUAL
OR
NOT
AT
ALL
YOUR
REO
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
LIVES
ONLY
BY
ACCEPTING
COERCION
THE
GUN
INTO
THE
SITUATION
AND
THAT
IS
SELFDESTRUCTIVE
OF
THE
WHOLE
ARGUMENT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
BASED
ONLY
ON
MIGHT
MAKES
RIGHT
SORT
OF
LIKE
SAYING
NOBODY
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
LIVE
WHEREUPON
I
WHIP
OUT
A
GUN
AND
SHOOT
YOU
DEAD
END
OF
ARGUMENT
THERE
ARE
ACTUALLY
PEOPLE
THAT
STILL
BELIEVE
LOVE
CANAL
WAS
SOME
KIND
OF
ENVIRONMENTAL
DISASTER
WEIRD
EH
THESE
OPINIONS
ARE
MINE
AND
YOU
CANT
HAVE
EM
BUT
ILL
RENT
EM
CHEAP
