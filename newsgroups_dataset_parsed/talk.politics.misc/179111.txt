can
someone
tell
me
why
when
mr
cramer
spouts
on
about
homosexuals
he
only
addresses
homosexual
men
and
never
in
any
post
ive
read
addressed
lesbians
i
cant
really
speak
for
mr
cramer
here
but
i
can
say
that
a
homosexual
male
is
an
entirely
different
animal
than
a
lesbian
there
is
virtually
nothing
that
is
analogous
or
related
between
the
aberrant
behaviors
practiced
by
these
two
groups
of
deviants
obviously
a
homosexual
male
is
of
the
xy
chromosome
pair
and
the
lesbian
is
of
xx
besides
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
price
of
eggs
since
mr
cramer
is
very
straight
he
most
probably
gets
off
to
the
thought
of
lesbians
like
the
majority
of
adolescent
males
the
views
expressed
herein
are

i
hate
to
disappoint
you
but
thats
not
the
case
i
dont
get
off
on
lesbian
sex
nor
am
i
an
adolescent
now
when
i
was
an
adolescent
i
believed
that
homosexuals
were
just
like
everyone
else
but
ive
learned

not
