WRITES
THE
OFFICIAL
AND
LEGAL
TERM
FOR
RAPE
IS
THE
CRIME
OF
FORCING
A
FEMALE
TO
SUBMIT
TO
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
PLEASE
SUPPLY
ME
WITH
SOME
REFERENCES
I
WAS
NOT
AWARE
THAT
ALL
STATES
HAD
THE
WORD
FEMALE
IN
THE
RAPE
STATUTES
I
AM
SURE
OTHERS
ARE
SURPRISED
AS
WELL
I
KNOW
THATS
HOW
IT
WORKS
IN
PRACTICE
NICENFAIR
NOT
BUT
WAS
UNAWARE
THAT
IT
WAS
IN
THE
STATUTES
AS
APPLYING
TO
FEMALES
ONLY
UNIFORMLY
THROUGHOUT
THE
US
I
AGREE
MOSTLY
WITH
CHRIS
IT
IS
UNFORTUNATELY
IMO
TRUE
THAT
THE
FBI
FIGURES
FOR
RAPE
BASED
ON
THE
UNIFORM
CRIME
REPORT
REPORT
ONLY
FEMALE
RAPES
HOWEVER
SOME
STATES
SUCH
AS
ILLINOIS
ARE
NOT
TABLUATED
BECAUSE
THEY
REFUSE
TO
COMPLY
WITH
THIS
SEXIST
DEFINITION
