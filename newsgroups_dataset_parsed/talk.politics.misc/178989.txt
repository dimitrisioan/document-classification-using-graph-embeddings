I
ASK
THIS
QUESTION
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
A
TRADITION
AND
ONE
THAT
IS
HIGHLY
REGARDED
BY
MANY
PEOPLE
THAT
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
JEWS
ELECTED
TO
THROW
THEMSELVES
OFF
A
CLIFF
AT
MASADA
RATHER
THAN
SUBMIT
TO
ROMAN
RULE
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
AT
MASADA
AND
THOSE
AT
WACO
WOULD
SEEM
IN
GENERAL
TERMS
QUITE
SIMILAR
AND
YET
SO
FAR
AS
IM
AWARE
NOBODY
HAS
SERIOUSLY
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
JEWS
WERE
INSANE
AS
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
POINTED
OUT
THE
JEWS
FACED
A
TOTALLY
DIFFERENT
FATE
AT
THE
HAND
OF
THE
ROMANS
THAN
DID
KORESH
AT
THE
HAND
OF
THE
FEDS
THE
JEWISH
MEN
WOULD
MOST
LIKELY
HAVE
BEEN
CRUCIFIED
THE
THE
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
SOLD
INTO
SLAVERY
ONE
CAN
WELL
ARGUE
THAT
KORESH
MAY
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
A
SIMILAR
FATE
AWAITED
HIM
BUT
THERE
WAS
SCANT
RATIONAL
BASIS
FOR
THAT
FEAR
SO
INSANE
SEEMS
TO
DESCRIBE
ANY
SUCH
BELIEF
WHAT
IS
THE
PENALTY
IF
CONVICTED
OF
MURDERING
FEDERAL
AGENTS
IN
TEXAS
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
NONE
OF
WHICH
EXCUSES
THE
RECKLESS
ACTION
OF
THE
FEDS
WHO
ALLEGEDLY
BELIEVING
THEY
WERE
DEALING
WITH
A
NUT
SHOULD
HAVE
EXERCISE
MUCH
MORE
RESTRAINT
INDEED
GIVEN
THEIR
STATED
GOALS
OF
SAVING
THE
CHILDREN
ONE
MIGHT
ALSO
APPLY
THE
MONIKER
INSANE

THE
FEDS
