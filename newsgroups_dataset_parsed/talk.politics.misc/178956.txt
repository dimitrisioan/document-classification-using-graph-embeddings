marc
mueller
writes
considering
that
clinton
received
a
draft
notice
and
got
out
of
it
he
admits
it
the
political
feasibility
of
him
abolishing
it
is
not
something
he
would
be
inclined
to
risk
any
extra
exposure
on
as
a
libertarian
with
a
small
l
who
voted
for
clinton
i
think
that
he
should
abolish
the
selective
service
and
the
draft
if
his
conscience
forbade
him
to
go
to
war
in
vietnam
it
should
forbid
him
to
perpetuate
this
system
of
governmentsanctioned
slavery
agreed
congress
took
money
from
nasa
and
fha
to
fund
the
second
seawolf
the
shipyards
are
still
building
los
angeles
class
submarines
and
there
is
a
lack
of
asw
foes
to
contend
with
the
navy
is
considering
reducing
the
number
of
attack
subs
to
navy
times
and
that
would
entail
getting
rid
of
or
mothballing
some
of
the
current
los
angeles
class
politically
general
dynamics
is
in
connecticut
and
we
will
get
seawolf
subs
whether
we
need
them
or
not
if
our
government
would
pay
attention
to
serious
domestic
issues
the
economy
and
choose
to
stay
out
of
other
peoples
wars
iraq
bosnia
somalia
we
would
not
be
in
this
fix
an
anyway
couldnt
the
jobs
be
replaced
by
improving
our
domestic
situation
im
not
for
continued
deficit
spending
but
if
clinton
and
congress
want
to
spend
id
rather
they
improve
the
infrastructure
than
fight
other
peoples
wars
in
addition
more
bases
need
to
be
closed
probably
long
beach
naval
station
and
others
the
navy
is
talking
about
three
main
bases
on
each
coast
being
required
to
home
port
a
total
fleet
of
ships
the
question
is
whether
les
aspin
and
clinton
will
be
able
to
face
down
a
pork
happy
congress
a
novel
idea
getting
away
from
naval
bases
what
about
refurbishing
decommissioned
air
force
bases
as
airports
this
would
be
so
much
cheaper
than
building
them
from
the
ground
up
denvers
new
airport
is
one
of
the
most
appalling
examples
of
porkbarreling
and
cronyism
i
have
seen
in
my
lifetime
even
if
no
more
airports
are
needed
im
sure
bill
gates
or
ross
perot
would
love
to
have
their
own
private
airfields
and
the
money
from
their
purchases
could
be
applied
to
the
public
debt
