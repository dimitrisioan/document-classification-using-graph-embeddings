all

thats
virtually
an
operational
definition
of

if
you
can
find
an

a
human
community
that
doesnt
then
you
have
discovered

its
pointless
asking
whether
communities
should
do
this
they
do
do
this
its
like
asking
whether
a
leopard
should
have
spots
it
just
evolved
that
way
human
communities
evolved
in
both
the
biological
and
social
senses
of
evolve
to
have
this
characteristic
you
can
debate
whether
some
particular
matter
should
be
left
up
to
the
individual
or
not
this
is
part
of
the
above
process
of
evolution

it
is
the
nature

a

to
impose

peter
at
all
times
in
human
history
people
have
killed
and
stolen
from
one
another
if
you
can
find
an
example
of
where
this
hasnt
happened
in
history
then
you
have
discovered
a
new
phenomenon
in

it
is
pointless
asking
whether
people
should

they

this
it
has
just
evolved
that

humans
have
evolved
to
have
this
characteristivc
you
can
debate
whether
this
should
be
particular
matter
should
be
left
up
to
the
individual
or
not
but
it
is
the
nature
of
humans
to
kill
and
steal
from
others
and
you
will
not
find
a
single
counterexample
of
a
society
without
these
types
in
nature
please
find
a
better
argument
than
thats
the
way
it
has
always
been
child
mortality
has
always
been
yet
we
find
it
in
our
hearts
to
have
made
an
attempt
to
change
