RED

WRITES
IN

RICHARD
HOENES
WRITES
YES
WEVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
SURVIVORS
ARE
NOW
SAYING
THAT
WEVE
ALSO
SEEN
THE
VIDEOTAPE
WHICH
SHOWS
THAT
THE
FIRE
STARTED
IN
TWO
OR
THREE
DIFFERENT
PLACES
WHICH
WERENT
NEAR
THE
TANK
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
THE
TAPE
ON
CNN
WHICH
NETWORK
DID
YOU
SEE
IT
ON
TIM
I
SAW
THE
FILM
ON
CNN
AS
IT
HAPPEND
IT
WAS
CLEAR
FROM
THAT
TIM
TAPE
THAT
THE
FIRE
STARTED
IN
ONE
LOCATION
RIGHT
WHERE
THE
TIM
TANK
WAS
ATTACKING
AND
THEN
HAD
PULLED
BACK
THERE
WERE
NOT
TIM
SEVERAL
SPOTS
WHERE
THE
FIRE
STARTED
IT
STARTED
IN
ONE
TIM
LOCATION
AND
WAS
SPREAD
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
HEAVY
WIND
TIM
THE
FBI
CLAIMS
TO
HAVE
SEEN
OR
FILMED
SEVERAL
STARTING
TIM
POINTS
YET
THEY
KEEP
THIS
HIDDEN
THEY
HAVE
SPREAD
SO
MUCH
TIM
LIES
WELL
I
GUESS
IF
I
WAS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
MASS
MURDER
TIM
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
EXERCISING
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS
I
TIM
WOULD
LIE
ABOUT
IT
TOO
GOSH
TIM
YOU
MUST
HAVE
SEEN
A
DIFFERENT
LIVE
BROADCAST
THAN
I
DID
WHILE
THE
SMOKE
DID
EMERGE
FROM
ONE
PLACE
INITIALLY
IT
WAS
A
CONSIDERABLE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
TANK
AND
IN
A
VERY
SHORT
TIME
FIRE
APPEARED
AT
SEVERAL
PLACES
A
GOOD
DISTANCE
APART
FROM
THERE
THEN
THERES
THAT
NAGGING
QUESTION
ABOUT
WHY
OUT
OF
ALL
THOSE
PEOPLE
ONLY
A
FEW
MADE
ANY
ATTEMPTS
TO
ESCAPE
OR
SAVE
THE
CHILDREN
IF
IT
WERE
ME
WITH
MY
CHILD
AND
I
WASNT
COMMITTING
SUICIDE
I
BELIEVE
I
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
SOME
ATTEMPT
TO
AT
LEAST
SAVE
THE
CHILD
AS
IT
WAS
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THE
SURVIVORS
WAS
ATTEMPTING
TO
GO
BACK
INTO
THE
FIRE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
PHYSICALLY
REMOVED
NO
ONE
LIFTED
A
FINGER
TO
BRING
OUT
A
CHILD
APPARENTLY
HOW
DO
YOU
EXPLAIN
THAT
AND
THE
TWO
SURVIVORS
WHO
CLAIMED
TO
HAVE
DOUSED
THE
PLACE
WITH
LANTERN
OIL
AND
SET
THE
FIRE
NO
DOUBT
ON
DAVIDS
ORDERS
AT
LEAST
UNTIL
THE
LAWYERS
TALKED
TO
THEM
TIM
AND
ALSO
WHY
HAVE
THEY
NOT
YET
RELEASED
THE
SEARCH
WARRANT
THAT
IS
A
GOOD
QUESTION
MAYBE
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
BE
A
FURTHER
EMBARRASSMENT
SEEING
AS
HOW
THE
ATF
WENT
IN
THERE
IN
DIRTY
HARRY
MODE
INITIALLY
AS
STUPIDLY
AS
IT
ALL
WAS
HANDLED
I
FIND
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ENTIRE
FBI
HAS
COMPLETELY
GONE
CORRUPT
UNDER
A
NEW
ADMINISTRATION
LESS
THAN
DAYS
OLD
STUPIDITY
AND
BAD
DECISIONS
AND
PLANS
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
WITH
US
THEY
JUST
HAD
AN
ALIGNMENT

WACO
