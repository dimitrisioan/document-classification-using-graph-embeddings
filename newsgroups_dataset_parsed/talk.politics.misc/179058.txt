ROOM
PM
EDT
THE
PRESIDENT
TERRY
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
QUESTION
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
THERES
A
GROWING
FEELING
THAT
THE
WESTERN
RESPONSE
TO
BLOODSHED
IN
BOSNIA
HAS
BEEN
WOEFULLY
INADEQUATE
HOLOCAUST
SURVIVOR
ELIE
WIESEL
ASKED
YOU
YESTERDAY
TO
DO
SOMETHING
ANYTHING
TO
STOP
THE
FIGHTING
IS
THE
UNITED
STATES
CONSIDERING
TAKING
UNILATERAL
ACTION
SUCH
AS
AIR
STRIKES
AGAINST
SERB
ARTILLERY
SITES
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
FIRST
LET
ME
SAY
AS
YOU
KNOW
FOR
MORE
THAN
A
WEEK
NOW
WE
HAVE
BEEN
SERIOUSLY
REVIEWING
OUR
OPTIONS
FOR
FURTHER
ACTION
AND
I
WANT
TO
SAY
TOO
LETS
LOOK
AT
THE
LAST
THREE
MONTHS
SINCE
I
BECAME
PRESIDENT
I
HAVE
WORKED
WITH
OUR
ALLIES
AND
WE
HAVE
TRIED
TO
MOVE
FORWARD
FIRST
ON
THE
NOFLY
ZONE
ON
ENFORCEMENT
OF
IT
ON
THE
HUMANITARIAN
AIRDROPS
ON
THE
WAR
CRIMES
INVESTIGATION
ON
GETTING
THE
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PEACE
PROCESS
WE
HAVE
MADE
SOME
PROGRESS
AND
NOW
WE
HAVE
A
VERY
MUCH
TOUGHER
SANCTIONS
RESOLUTION
AND
LEON
FUERTH
WHO
IS
THE
NATIONAL
SECURITY
ADVISOR
TO
THE
VICE
PRESIDENT
IS
IN
EUROPE
NOW
WORKING
ON
IMPLEMENTING
THAT
THAT
IS
GOING
TO
MAKE
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
TO
SERBIA
AND
WE
ARE
REVIEWING
OTHER
OPTIONS
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
ACT
WE
SHOULD
LEAD
THE
UNITED
STATES
SHOULD
LEAD
WE
HAVE
LED
FOR
THE
LAST
THREE
MONTHS
WE
HAVE
MOVED
THE
COALITION
AND
TO
BE
FAIR
OUR
ALLIES
IN
EUROPE
HAVE
BEEN
WILLING
TO
DO
THEIR
PART
AND
THEY
HAVE
TROOPS
ON
THE
GROUND
THERE
BUT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
WE
SHOULD
ACT
ALONE
UNILATERALLY
NOR
DO
I
THINK
WE
WILL
HAVE
TO
AND
IN
THE
NEXT
SEVERAL
DAYS
I
THINK
WE
WILL
FINALIZE
THE
EXTENSIVE
REVIEW
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
GOING
ON
AND
WHICH
HAS
TAKEN
A
LOT
OF
MY
TIME
AS
WELL
AS
THE
TIME
OF
THE
ADMINISTRATION
AS
IT
SHOULD
HAVE
OVER
THE
LAST
DAYS
OR
SO
I
THINK
WELL
FINISH
THAT
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
AND
THEN
WELL
HAVE
A
POLICY
AND
WELL
ANNOUNCE
IT
AND
EVERYBODY
CAN
EVALUATE
IT
Q
CAN
I
FOLLOW
UP
THE
PRESIDENT
SURE
Q
DO
YOU
SEE
ANY
PARALLEL
BETWEEN
THE
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
IN
BOSNIA
AND
THE
HOLOCAUST
THE
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
THE
HOLOCAUST
IS
ON
A
WHOLE
DIFFERENT
LEVEL
I
THINK
IT
IS
WITHOUT
PRECEDENT
OR
PEER
IN
HUMAN
HISTORY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
IS
THE
KIND
OF
INHUMANITY
THAT
THE
HOLOCAUST
TOOK
TO
THE
NTH
DEGREE
THE
IDEA
OF
MOVING
PEOPLE
AROUND
AND
ABUSING
THEM
AND
OFTEN
KILLING
THEM
SOLELY
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
ETHNICITY
IS
AN
ABHORRENT
THING
AND
IT
IS
ESPECIALLY
TROUBLESOME
IN
THAT
AREA
WHERE
PEOPLE
OF
DIFFERENT
ETHNIC
GROUPS
LIVE
SIDE
BY
SIDE
FOR
SO
LONG
TOGETHER
AND
I
THINK
YOU
HAVE
TO
STAND
UP
AGAINST
IT
I
THINK
ITS
WRONG
WE
WERE
TALKING
TODAY
ABOUT
ALL
OF
THE
OTHER
TROUBLES
IN
THAT
REGION
I
WAS
HAPPY
TO
SEE
THE
VIOLENCE
BETWEEN
THE
CROATS
AND
THE
MUSLIMS
IN
BOSNIA
SUBSIDE
THIS
MORNING
AND
I
THINK
WERE
MAKING
PROGRESS
ON
THAT
FRONT
BUT
WHATS
GOING
ON
WITH
THE
SERBIANS
AND
THE
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
IS
QUALITATIVELY
DIFFERENT
THAN
THE
OTHER
CONFLICTS
BOTH
WITHIN
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
AND
IN
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
REGION
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
BY
ANY
COUNT
YOU
HAVE
NOT
HAD
A
GOOD
WEEK
IN
YOUR
PRESIDENCY
THE
TRAGEDY
IN
WACO
THE
DEFEAT
OF
YOUR
STIMULUS
BILL
THE
STANDOFF
IN
BOSNIA
WHAT
DID
YOU
DO
WRONG
AND
WHAT
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
DO
DIFFERENTLY
HOW
DO
YOU
LOOK
AT
THINGS
ARE
YOU
REASSESSING
LAUGHTER
THE
PRESIDENT
I
DONT
REALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
SITUATION
IN
BOSNIA
ITS
NOT
BEEN
A
GOOD
WEEK
FOR
THE
WORLD
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATION
COULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
DIFFERENT
ON
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
ID
LIKE
TO
PUT
IT
INTO
THE
LARGER
CONTEXT
AND
REMIND
YOU
THAT
IN
THIS
DAYS
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
FUNDAMENTALLY
CHANGED
THE
DIRECTION
OF
AN
AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT
WE
HAVE
ABANDONED
TRICKLEDOWN
ECONOMICS
WEVE
ABANDONED
THE
POLICIES
THAT
BROUGHT
THE
DEBT
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
FROM
TRILLION
TO
TRILLION
IN
ONLY
A
DECADE
THE
BUDGET
PLAN
WHICH
PASSED
THE
CONGRESS
WHICH
WILL
REDUCE
THE
DEFICIT
AND
INCREASE
INVESTMENT
HAS
LED
TO
A
LOW
IN
MORTGAGE
RATES
DRAMATICALLY
LOWER
INTEREST
RATES
THERE
ARE
PROBABLY
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
ROOM
WHO
HAVE
REFINANCED
THEIR
HOME
MORTGAGES
IN
THE
LAST
THREE
MONTHS
OR
WHO
HAVE
HAD
ACCESS
TO
CHEAPER
CREDIT
THATS
GOING
TO
PUT
TENS
OF
BILLION
DOLLARS
COURSING
THROUGHOUT
THIS
ECONOMY
IN
WAYS
THAT
ARE
VERY
VERY
GOOD
FOR
THE
COUNTRY
AND
SO
WE
ARE
MOVING
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
ECONOMICALLY
I
REGRET
THAT
THE
STIMULUS
DID
NOT
PASS
AND
I
HAVE
BEGUN
TO
ASK
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
ASK
NOT
ONLY
PEOPLE
IN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BUT
PEOPLE
IN
THE
CONGRESS
WHETHER
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
I
COULD
HAVE
DONE
DIFFERENTLY
TO
PASS
THAT
PART
OF
THE
REASON
IT
DIDNT
PASS
WAS
POLITICS
PART
OF
IT
WAS
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
IDEAS
THERE
ARE
REALLY
PEOPLE
STILL
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
ITS
NOT
NEEDED
I
JUST
DISAGREE
WITH
THAT
I
THINK
THE
RECOVERY
THE
ECONOMISTS
SAY
ITS
BEEN
UNDERWAY
FOR
ABOUT
TWO
YEARS
AND
WEVE
STILL
HAD
MONTHS
OF
SEVEN
PERCENT
UNEMPLOYMENT
AND
ALL
THE
WEALTHY
COUNTRIES
ARE
HAVING
TROUBLE
CREATING
JOBS
SO
I
THINK
THERE
WAS
AN
IDEA
BASE
AN
ARGUMENT
THERE
THAT
WHILE
WERE
WAITING
FOR
THE
LOWER
INTEREST
RATES
AND
THE
DEFICIT
REDUCTION
AND
THE
INVESTMENTS
OF
THE
NEXT
FOUR
YEARS
TO
TAKE
EFFECT
THIS
SORT
OF
SUPPLEMENTAL
APPROPRIATION
SHOULD
GO
FORWARD
NOW
I
HAVE
TO
TELL
YOU
I
DID
MISGAUGE
THAT
BECAUSE
A
MAJORITY
OF
THE
REPUBLICAN
SENATORS
NOW
SITTING
IN
THE
SENATE
VOTED
FOR
A
SIMILAR
STIMULUS
WHEN
RONALD
REAGAN
WAS
PRESIDENT
IN
AND
VOTED
TIMES
FOR
REGULAR
SUPPLEMENTAL
APPROPRIATIONS
LIKE
THIS
I
JUST
MISGAUGED
IT
AND
I
HOPE
THAT
I
CAN
LEARN
SOMETHING
IVE
JUST
BEEN
HERE
DAYS
AND
YOU
KNOW
I
WAS
A
GOVERNOR
WORKING
WITH
A
CONTENTIOUS
LEGISLATURE
FOR
YEARS
AND
IT
TOOK
ME
A
DECADE
TO
GET
POLITICAL
REFORM
THERE
SO
IT
TAKES
TIME
TO
CHANGE
THINGS
BUT
I
BASICALLY
FEEL
VERY
GOOD
ABOUT
WHATS
HAPPENED
IN
THE
FIRST
DAYS
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
CONGRESS
Q
WACO
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
WITH
REGARD
TO
WACO
I
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
TO
ADD
TO
WHAT
IVE
ALREADY
SAID
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
I
WANT
THE
SITUATION
LOOKED
INTO
I
WANT
US
TO
BRING
IN
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
ANY
INSIGHTS
TO
BEAR
ON
THAT
I
THINK
ITS
VERY
IMPORTANT
THAT
THE
WHOLE
THING
BE
THOROUGHLY
GONE
OVER
BUT
I
STILL
MAINTAIN
WHAT
I
SAID
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
THAT
THE
OFFENDER
THERE
WAS
DAVID
KORESH
AND
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THE
UNITED
STATES
GOVERNMENT
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
FACT
THAT
A
BUNCH
OF
FANATICS
DECIDED
TO
KILL
THEMSELVES
AND
IM
SORRY
THAT
THEY
KILLED
THEIR
CHILDREN
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
TO
FOLLOW
UP
PARTLY
ON
HELEN
ON
YOUR
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
AND
ON
YOUR
POLITICAL
APPROACH
TO
CAPITOL
HILL
ROSS
PEROT
SAID
TODAY
THAT
YOURE
PLAYING
GAMES
WITH
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
IN
YOUR
TAX
POLICY
HE
WAS
STRONGLY
CRITICAL
OF
YOUR
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
HE
SAID
HES
GOING
TO
LAUNCH
AN
ADVERTISING
CAMPAIGN
AGAINST
THE
NORTH
AMERICAN
FREE
TRADE
AGREEMENT
HOW
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
HANDLE
HIS
POLITICAL
CRITICISM
WILL
IT
COMPLICATE
YOUR
EFFORTS
ON
THE
HILL
WITH
YOUR
ECONOMIC
PLAN
AND
DO
YOU
PLAN
TO
REPACKAGE
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
IN
YOUR
STIMULUS
PROGRAM
AND
TRY
TO
RESUBMIT
THEM
TO
THE
HILL
THE
PRESIDENT
LET
ME
ANSWER
THAT
QUESTION
FIRST
WERE
GOING
TO
REVISIT
ALL
OF
THAT
OVER
THE
NEXT
FEW
DAYS
IM
GOING
TO
BE
TALKING
TO
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS
AND
TO
OTHERS
TO
SEE
WHAT
WE
CAN
DO
ABOUT
THAT
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
ECONOMIC
PLAN
I
MUST
SAY
I
FOUND
THAT
RATHER
AMAZING
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GET
INTO
AN
ARGUMENT
WITH
MR
PEROT
ILL
BE
INTERESTED
TO
HEAR
WHAT
HIS
SPECIFICS
ARE
BUT
I
WOULD
GO
BACK
AND
READ
HIS
BOOK
AND
HIS
PLAN
THERES
A
REMARKABLE
CONVERGENCE
EXCEPT
THAT
WE
HAVE
MORE
SPECIFIC
BUDGET
CUTS
WE
RAISE
TAXES
LESS
ON
THE
MIDDLE
CLASS
AND
MORE
ON
THE
WEALTHY
BUT
OTHERWISE
THE
PLANS
ARE
REMARKABLY
SIMILAR
SO
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
ILL
BE
INTERESTED
TO
SEE
IF
MAYBE
PERHAPS
HES
CHANGED
HIS
POSITION
FROM
HIS
BOOK
LAST
YEAR
AND
HE
HAS
SOME
NEW
IDEAS
TO
BRING
TO
BEAR
ILL
BE
GLAD
TO
HEAR
THEM
Q
TO
FOLLOW
UP
SIR
HOW
DO
YOU
PLAN
TO
HANDLE
HIS
POLITICAL
CRITICISM
HES
LAUNCHED
A
CAMPAIGN
AGAINST
YOU
DO
YOU
THINK
YOU
CAN
SIT
BACK
AND
JUST
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
WILL
ASK
YOU
TO
APPLY
THE
SAME
LEVEL
OF
SCRUTINY
TO
HIM
AS
YOU
DO
TO
ME
AND
IF
HES
CHANGED
HIS
POSITION
FROM
THE
POSITIONS
HE
TOOK
IN
THE
CAMPAIGN
LAST
YEAR
THEN
WE
NEED
TO
KNOW
WHY
AND
WHAT
HIS
IDEAS
ARE
MAYBE
HES
GOT
SOME
CONSTRUCTIVE
IDEAS
I
THINK
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
HAVE
SHOWN
THAT
THEYRE
VERY
IMPATIENT
WITH
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
WANT
TO
PRODUCE
RESULTS
AND
THE
ONE
THING
I
THINK
THAT
EVERYBODY
HAS
FIGURED
OUT
ABOUT
ME
IN
THE
LAST
EVEN
IF
THEY
DONT
AGREE
WITH
WHAT
I
DO
IS
THAT
I
WANT
TO
GET
SOMETHING
DONE
I
JUST
CAME
HERE
TO
TRY
TO
CHANGE
THINGS
I
WANT
TO
DO
THINGS
AND
I
WANT
TO
DO
THINGS
THAT
HELP
PEOPLES
LIVES
SO
MY
JUDGMENT
IS
THAT
IF
HE
MAKES
A
SUGGESTION
THAT
IS
GOOD
THAT
IS
CONSTRUCTIVE
THAT
TAKES
US
BEYOND
SOME
IDEA
IVE
PROPOSED
THAT
WILL
CHANGE
PEOPLES
LIVES
FOR
THE
BETTER
FINE
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THAT
OUGHT
TO
BE
THE
TEST
THAT
WE
APPLY
TO
EVERYONE
WHO
WEIGHS
INTO
THIS
DEBATE
AND
NOT
JUST
TO
THE
PRESIDENT
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
TO
GO
BACK
TO
BOSNIA
FOR
A
MINUTE
YOU
CONTINUE
TO
INSIST
THAT
THIS
HAS
TO
BE
MULTILATERAL
ACTION
A
CRITERIA
THAT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
HAMSTRUNG
US
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MANY
OPTIONS
THUS
FAR
AND
MAKES
IT
LOOK
AS
IF
THIS
IS
A
STATE
OF
PARALYSIS
THE
UNITED
STATES
IS
THE
LAST
REMAINING
SUPERPOWER
WHY
IS
IT
NOT
APPROPRIATE
IN
THIS
SITUATION
FOR
THE
UNITED
STATES
TO
ACT
UNILATERALLY
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
THE
UNITED
STATES
SURELY
YOU
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
EVEN
AS
THE
LAST
REMAINING
SUPERPOWER
HAS
TO
ACT
CONSISTENT
WITH
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
UNDER
SOME
MANDATE
OF
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
Q
BUT
YOU
HAVE
A
MANDATE
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
THEY
DO
AND
THAT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
WE
HAVE
UNDER
REVIEW
I
HAVENT
RULED
OUT
ANY
OPTION
FOR
ACTION
I
WOULD
REMIND
ALL
OF
YOU
I
HAVE
NOT
RULED
OUT
ANY
OPTION
EXCEPT
THAT
WE
HAVE
NOT
DISCUSSED
AND
WE
ARE
NOT
CONSIDERING
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
AMERICAN
FORCES
INTO
CONTINUING
HOSTILITIES
THERE
WE
ARE
NOT
SO
WE
ARE
REVIEWING
OTHER
OPTIONS
BUT
I
ALSO
WOULD
REMIND
YOU
THAT
TO
BE
FAIR
OUR
ALLIES
HAVE
HAD
THE
FRENCH
THE
BRITISH
AND
THE
CANADIANS
HAVE
HAD
TROOPS
ON
THE
GROUND
THERE
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
JUSTIFIABLY
WORRIED
ABOUT
THOSE
BUT
THEY
HAVE
SUPPORTED
THE
AIRDROPS
THE
TOUGHENING
OF
THE
SANCTIONS
THEY
WELCOMED
THE
AMERICAN
DELEGATION
NOW
IN
EUROPE
WORKING
ON
HOW
TO
MAKE
THESE
SANCTIONS
REALLY
WORK
AND
REALLY
BITE
AGAINST
SERBIA
AND
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
THE
OTHER
NATIONS
INVOLVED
ARE
ALSO
GENUINELY
REASSESSING
THEIR
POSITION
AND
I
WOULD
NOT
RULE
OUT
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
CAN
REACH
AN
AGREEMENT
FOR
A
CONCERTED
ACTION
THAT
GOES
BEYOND
WHERE
WE
HAVE
BEEN
I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
CRITICISM
OF
THE
BRITISH
THE
FRENCH
AND
OTHERS
ABOUT
THAT
Q
WOULD
THAT
BE
MILITARY
ACTION
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
SEVERAL
OF
THE
LEADING
LIGHTS
IN
YOUR
ADMINISTRATION
RANGING
FROM
YOUR
FBI
DIRECTOR
TO
YOUR
UN
AMBASSADOR
TO
YOUR
DEPUTY
BUDGET
DIRECTOR
TO
YOUR
HEALTH
SERVICES
SECRETARY
HAVE
ISSUED
STATEMENTS
IN
THE
LAST
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
WHICH
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CONTRADICTORY
TO
SOME
OF
THE
POSITIONS
YOUVE
TAKEN
IN
YOUR
ADMINISTRATION
WHY
IS
THAT
ARE
YOU
LOSING
YOUR
POLITICAL
GRIP
THE
PRESIDENT
GIVE
ME
AN
EXAMPLE
Q
EXAMPLE
JUDGE
SESSIONS
SAID
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
CHILD
ABUSE
IN
WACO
MADELEINE
ALBRIGHT
HAS
SAID
IN
THIS
MORNINGS
NEWSPAPERS
AT
LEAST
THAT
SHE
FAVORS
AIR
STRIKES
IN
BOSNIA
ALL
OF
THESE
ARE
THINGS
YOU
SAID
THAT
YOU
DIDNT
SUPPORT
THE
PRESIDENT
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
WE
KNOW
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
HAD
SEX
WITH
CHILDREN
I
THINK
THAT
IS
UNDISPUTED
IS
IT
NOT
IS
IT
NOT
DOES
ANYBODY
DISPUTE
THAT
WHERE
I
COME
FROM
THAT
QUALIFIES
AS
CHILD
ABUSE
AND
WE
KNOW
THAT
HE
HAD
PEOPLE
TEACHING
THESE
KIDS
HOW
TO
KILL
THEMSELVES
I
THINK
THAT
QUALIFIES
AS
ABUSE
AND
IM
NOT
CRITICIZING
JUDGE
SESSIONS
BECAUSE
I
DONT
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
HE
SAID
IN
TERMS
OF
MADELEINE
ALBRIGHT
MADELEINE
ALBRIGHT
HAS
MADE
NO
PUBLIC
STATEMENT
AT
ALL
ABOUT
AIR
STRIKES
THERE
IS
A
PRESS
REPORT
THAT
SHE
WROTE
ME
A
CONFIDENTIAL
LETTER
IN
WHICH
SHE
EXPRESSED
HER
OR
MEMO
IN
WHICH
SHE
EXPRESSED
HER
VIEWS
ABOUT
THE
NEW
DIRECTION
WE
SHOULD
TAKE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
MY
REQUEST
TO
ALL
THE
SENIOR
MEMBERS
OF
MY
ADMINISTRATION
TO
LET
ME
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
THOUGHT
WE
OUGHT
TO
DO
NEXT
AND
I
HAVE
HEARD
FROM
HER
AND
FROM
OTHERS
ABOUT
WHAT
THEY
THINK
WE
OUGHT
TO
DO
NEXT
AND
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
DISCUSS
THE
RECOMMENDATIONS
THEY
MADE
TO
ME
BUT
IN
THE
NEXT
FEW
DAYS
WHEN
I
MAKE
A
DECISION
ABOUT
WHAT
TO
DO
THEN
I
WILL
ANNOUNCE
WHAT
IM
GOING
TO
DO
SO
I
WOULDNT
SAY
THAT
EITHER
ONE
OF
THOSE
EXAMPLES
QUALIFIES
SPEAKING
OUT
OF
SCHOOL
Q
HOW
ABOUT
THE
VALUE
ADDED
TAX
MR
PRESIDENT
THE
PRESIDENT
WHAT
WAS
THAT
Q
THE
VALUE
ADDED
TAX
MRS
RIVLIN
AND
MISS
SHALALA
BOTH
SAID
THAT
THEY
THOUGHT
THAT
THAT
WAS
A
GOOD
IDEA
THE
PRESIDENT
I
DONT
MIND
THEM
SAYING
THEY
THINK
ITS
A
GOOD
IDEA
THERE
ARE
ALL
KINDS
OF
ARGUMENTS
FOR
IT
ON
POLICY
GROUNDS
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
WE
HAVE
DECIDED
TO
INCORPORATE
IT
IN
THE
HEALTH
CARE
DEBATE
NO
DECISION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
ON
THAT
AND
I
HAVE
NO
OBJECTION
TO
THEIR
EXPRESSING
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
THAT
WEVE
HAD
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
FROM
BUSINESS
AND
LABOR
COME
TO
US
SAYING
THAT
THEY
THOUGHT
THAT
TAX
WOULD
HELP
MAKE
THEIR
PARTICULAR
INDUSTRIES
MORE
COMPETITIVE
IN
THE
GLOBAL
ECONOMY
I
TOOK
NO
THAT
WASNT
TAKING
A
LINE
AGAINST
AN
ADMINISTRATION
POLICY
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
A
WEEK
AGO
A
GROUP
OF
GAY
AND
LESBIAN
REPRESENTATIVES
CAME
OUT
OF
A
MEETING
WITH
YOU
AND
EXPRESSED
IN
THE
MOST
RINGING
TERMS
THEIR
CONFIDENCE
IN
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THEM
AND
THEIR
POLITICAL
ASPIRATIONS
AND
THEIR
BELIEF
THAT
YOU
WOULD
FULFILL
THOSE
ASPIRATIONS
DO
YOU
FEEL
NOW
THAT
YOU
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
MEET
THEIR
NOW
ENHANCED
EXPECTATIONS
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THAT
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THEIR
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
THE
EXPECTATIONS
ARE
BUT
ILL
TELL
YOU
THIS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
COUNTRYS
POLICIES
SHOULD
BE
HEAVILY
BIASED
IN
FAVOR
OF
NONDISCRIMINATION
I
BELIEVE
WHEN
YOU
TELL
PEOPLE
THEY
CANT
DO
CERTAIN
THINGS
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
THAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
CAN
DO
THERE
OUGHT
TO
BE
AN
OVERWHELMING
AND
COMPELLING
REASON
FOR
IT
I
BELIEVE
WE
NEED
THE
SERVICES
OF
ALL
OF
OUR
PEOPLE
AND
I
HAVE
SAID
THAT
CONSISTENTLY
AND
NOT
AS
A
POLITICAL
PROPOSITION
THE
FIRST
TIME
THIS
ISSUE
CAME
UP
WAS
IN
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
BOSTON
I
WAS
JUST
ASKED
THE
QUESTION
ABOUT
IT
AND
I
MIGHT
ADD
ITS
INTERESTING
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
ATTACKED
OBVIOUSLY
THOSE
WHO
DISAGREE
WITH
ME
HERE
ARE
PRIMARILY
COMING
FROM
THE
POLITICAL
RIGHT
IN
AMERICA
WHEN
I
WAS
GOVERNOR
I
WAS
ATTACKED
FROM
THE
OTHER
DIRECTION
FOR
STICKING
UP
FOR
THE
RIGHTS
OF
RELIGIOUS
FUNDAMENTALISTS
TO
RUN
THEIR
CHILD
CARE
CENTERS
AND
TO
PRACTICE
HOME
SCHOOLING
UNDER
APPROPRIATE
SAFEGUARDS
I
JUST
HAVE
ALWAYS
HAD
AN
ALMOST
LIBERTARIAN
VIEW
THAT
WE
SHOULD
TRY
TO
PROTECT
THE
RIGHTS
OF
AMERICAN
INDIVIDUAL
CITIZENS
TO
LIVE
UP
TO
THE
FULLEST
OF
THEIR
CAPACITIES
AND
IM
GOING
TO
STICK
RIGHT
WITH
THAT
Q
ARE
YOU
CONCERNED
SIR
THAT
YOU
MAY
HAVE
GENERATED
EXPECTATIONS
ON
THEIR
END
AND
CRITICISM
AMONG
OTHERS
THAT
HAS
HAMSTRUNG
YOUR
ADMINISTRATION
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
FAR
TOO
GREAT
EMPHASIS
ON
THIS
ISSUE
THE
PRESIDENT
YES
BUT
I
HAVE
NOT
PLACED
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
EMPHASIS
ON
IT
ITS
GOTTEN
A
LOT
OF
EMPHASIS
IN
OTHER
QUARTERS
AND
IN
THE
PRESS
IVE
JUST
SIMPLY
TAKEN
MY
POSITION
AND
TRIED
TO
SEE
IT
THROUGH
AND
THATS
WHAT
I
DO
IT
DOESNT
TAKE
A
LOT
OF
MY
TIME
AS
PRESIDENT
TO
SAY
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
IN
AND
WHAT
I
INTEND
TO
DO
AND
THATS
WHAT
ILL
CONTINUE
TO
DO
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
GETTING
BACK
TO
THE
SITUATION
IN
BOSNIA
AND
WE
UNDERSTAND
YOU
HAVENT
MADE
ANY
FINAL
DECISIONS
ON
NEW
OPTIONS
PREVIOUSLY
CONSIDERED
UNACCEPTABLE
BUT
THE
TWO
MOST
COMMONLY
HEARD
OPTIONS
WOULD
BE
LIFTING
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
TO
ENABLE
THE
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
AND
TO
INITIATE
SOME
LIMITED
AIR
STRIKES
PERHAPS
TO
CUT
OFF
SUPPLY
LINES
WITHOUT
TELLING
US
YOUR
DECISION
PRESUMABLY
YOU
HAVENT
MADE
ANY
FINAL
DECISIONS
ON
THOSE
TWO
OPTIONS
WHAT
ARE
THE
PROS
AND
CONS
THAT
ARE
GOING
THROUGH
YOUR
MIND
RIGHT
NOW
AND
WILL
WEIGH
HEAVILY
ON
YOUR
FINAL
DECISION
THE
PRESIDENT
IM
RELUCTANT
TO
GET
INTO
THIS
THERE
ARE
THOSE
ARE
TWO
OF
THE
OPTIONS
THERE
ARE
SOME
OTHER
OPTIONS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
CONSIDERED
ALL
HAVE
PLUSES
AND
MINUSES
ALL
HAVE
SUPPORTERS
AND
OPPONENTS
WITHIN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
AND
IN
THE
CONGRESS
WHERE
I
WOULD
REMIND
YOU
HEAVY
CONSULTATIONS
WILL
BE
REQUIRED
TO
EMBARK
ON
ANY
NEW
POLICY
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
ON
THE
AIR
STRIKE
ISSUE
THE
PRONOUNCEMENTS
THAT
GENERAL
POWELL
HAS
MADE
GENERALLY
ABOUT
MILITARY
ACTION
APPLY
THERE
IF
YOU
TAKE
ACTION
IF
THE
UNITED
STATES
TAKES
ACTION
WE
MUST
HAVE
A
CLEARLYDEFINED
OBJECTIVE
THAT
CAN
BE
MET
WE
MUST
BE
ABLE
TO
UNDERSTAND
IT
AND
ITS
LIMITATIONS
MUST
BE
CLEAR
THE
UNITED
STATES
IS
NOT
SHOULD
NOT
BECOME
INVOLVED
AS
A
PARTISAN
IN
A
WAR
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
LIFTING
OF
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
THE
QUESTION
OBVIOUSLY
THERE
IS
IF
YOU
WIDEN
THE
CAPACITY
OF
PEOPLE
TO
FIGHT
WILL
THAT
HELP
TO
GET
A
SETTLEMENT
AND
BRING
ABOUT
PEACE
WILL
IT
LEAD
TO
MORE
BLOODSHED
WHAT
KIND
OF
REACTION
CAN
OTHERS
HAVE
THAT
WOULD
UNDERMINE
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
THE
POLICY
BUT
I
THINK
BOTH
OF
THEM
DESERVE
SOME
SERIOUS
CONSIDERATION
ALONG
WITH
SOME
OTHER
OPTIONS
WE
HAVE
Q
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
TRYING
TO
GET
US
INTO
WAR
IN
BOSNIA
ARE
REALLY
REMEMBERING
THAT
WE
HAVENT
TAKEN
CARE
OF
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
VETERANS
FROM
THE
LAST
WAR
AND
WE
COULDNT
TAKE
CARE
OF
OUR
PRISONERS
AND
GET
THEM
ALL
HOME
FROM
VIETNAM
AND
NOW
MANY
OF
THEM
ARE
COMING
UP
WITH
BILLS
FOR
TREATMENT
OF
AGENT
ORANGE
HOW
CAN
WE
AFFORD
TO
GO
TO
ANY
MORE
OF
THESE
WARS
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
I
THINK
THATS
A
GOOD
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
THE
UNITED
STATES
ITSELF
BECOMING
INVOLVED
AS
A
BELLIGERENT
IN
A
WAR
THERE
BUT
WE
ARE
AFTER
ALL
THE
WORLDS
ONLY
SUPER
POWER
WE
DO
HAVE
TO
LEAD
THE
WORLD
AND
THERE
IS
A
VERY
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
OF
SYSTEMATIC
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
IN
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
NOT
ONLY
ENORMOUS
FURTHER
HUMANITARIAN
CONSEQUENCES
AND
GOODNESS
KNOWS
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
BUT
ALSO
COULD
HAVE
OTHER
PRACTICAL
CONSEQUENCES
IN
OTHER
NEARBY
REGIONS
WHERE
THE
SAME
SORTS
OF
ETHNIC
TENSIONS
EXIST
Q
DID
YOU
MAKE
ANY
KIND
OF
AGREEMENT
WITH
BORIS
YELTSIN
TO
HOLD
OFF
EITHER
ON
AIR
STRIKES
OR
ANY
KIND
OF
AGGRESSIVE
ACTION
AGAINST
THE
SERBS
UNTIL
AFTER
SUNDAY
AND
IN
GENERAL
HOW
HAS
HIS
POLITICAL
SITUATION
AFFECTED
YOUR
DELIBERATION
ON
BOSNIA
THE
PRESIDENT
NO
I
HAVE
NOT
MADE
ANY
AGREEMENT
AND
HE
DID
NOT
ASK
FOR
THAT
WE
NEVER
EVEN
DISCUSSED
THAT
INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH
THE
RUSSIANS
I
WOULD
REMIND
YOU
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
PRESIDENT
YELTSINS
CAMPAIGN
ABSTAINED
FROM
OUR
ATTEMPT
TO
GET
TOUGHER
SANCTIONS
THROUGH
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
IN
WHAT
I
THOUGHT
WAS
THE
PROPER
DECISION
FOR
THEM
AND
ONE
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
IM
SURE
THE
REST
OF
THE
FREE
WORLD
VERY
MUCH
APPRECIATED
Q
DO
YOU
WISH
MR
PRESIDENT
THAT
YOUD
BECOME
MORE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PLANNING
OF
THE
WACO
OPERATION
AND
HOW
WOULD
YOU
HANDLE
THAT
SITUATION
DIFFERENTLY
NOW
THE
PRESIDENT
I
DONT
THINK
AS
A
PRACTICAL
MATTER
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
SHOULD
BECOME
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PLANNING
OF
THOSE
KINDS
OF
THINGS
AT
THAT
DETAIL
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
IM
SURE
WILL
COME
OUT
WHEN
WE
LOOK
INTO
THIS
IS
THE
QUESTIONS
WILL
BE
ASKED
AND
ANSWERED
DID
ALL
OF
US
WHO
UP
THE
LINE
OF
COMMAND
ASK
THE
QUESTIONS
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
ASKED
AND
GET
THE
ANSWERS
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
AND
I
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
THAT
BUT
AT
THE
TIME
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
AS
I
DID
BEFORE
THE
FIRST
THING
I
DID
AFTER
THE
ATF
AGENTS
WERE
KILLED
ONCE
WE
KNEW
THAT
THE
FBI
WAS
GOING
TO
GO
IN
WAS
TO
ASK
THAT
THE
MILITARY
BE
CONSULTED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
QUASI
AS
LEAST
MILITARY
NATURE
OF
THE
CONFLICT
GIVEN
THE
RESOURCES
THAT
KORESH
HAD
IN
HIS
COMPOUND
AND
THEIR
OBVIOUS
WILLINGNESS
TO
USE
THEM
AND
THEN
ON
THE
DAY
BEFORE
THE
ACTION
I
ASKED
THE
QUESTIONS
OF
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
WHICH
I
HAVE
REPORTED
TO
YOU
PREVIOUSLY
AND
WHICH
AT
THE
TIME
I
THOUGHT
WERE
SUFFICIENT
I
HAVE
AS
I
SAID
IM
SURE
I
LEAVE
IT
TO
OTHERS
TO
MAKE
THE
SUGGESTIONS
ABOUT
WHETHER
THERE
ARE
OTHER
QUESTIONS
I
SHOULD
HAVE
ASKED
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
WHAT
IS
YOUR
ASSESSMENT
OF
DIRECTOR
SESSIONS
ROLE
IN
THE
WACO
AFFAIR
AND
HAVE
YOU
MADE
A
DECISION
ON
HIS
FUTURE
AND
IF
YOU
HAVENT
WILL
YOU
GIVE
HIM
A
PERSONAL
HEARING
BEFORE
YOU
DO
DECIDE
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
HAVE
NO
ASSESSMENT
OF
HIS
ROLE
SINCE
I
HAD
NO
DIRECT
CONTACT
WITH
HIM
AND
I
MEAN
NO
NEGATIVE
OR
POSITIVE
INFERENCE
I
HAVE
NO
ASSESSMENT
THERE
I
STAND
BY
WHAT
I
SAID
BEFORE
ABOUT
MY
GENERAL
HIGH
REGARD
FOR
THE
FBI
AND
IM
WAITING
FOR
A
RECOMMENDATION
FROM
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
ABOUT
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
FBI
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
SINCE
YOU
SAID
THAT
ONE
SIDE
IN
BOSNIA
CONFLICT
REPRESENTS
INHUMANITY
THAT
THE
HOLOCAUST
CARRIED
TO
THE
NTH
DEGREE
WHY
DO
YOU
THEN
TELL
US
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
CANNOT
TAKE
A
PARTISAN
VIEW
IN
THIS
WAR
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
I
SAID
THAT
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
IS
SOMETHING
WE
OUGHT
TO
STAND
UP
AGAINST
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
OR
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
CAN
ENTER
A
WAR
IN
EFFECT
TO
REDRAW
THE
LINES
GEOGRAPHICAL
LINES
OF
REPUBLICS
WITHIN
WHAT
WAS
YUGOSLAVIA
OR
THAT
THAT
WOULD
ULTIMATELY
BE
SUCCESSFUL
I
THINK
WHAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
HAS
TO
DO
IS
TO
TRY
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHETHER
THERE
IS
SOME
WAY
CONSISTENT
WITH
FORCING
THE
PEOPLE
TO
RESOLVE
THEIR
OWN
DIFFICULTIES
WE
CAN
STAND
UP
TO
AND
STOP
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
AND
THAT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
THE
DIFFICULTY
WE
ARE
WRESTLING
WITH
THIS
IS
CLEARLY
THE
MOST
DIFFICULT
FOREIGN
POLICY
PROBLEM
WE
FACE
AND
THAT
ALL
OF
OUR
ALLIES
FACE
AND
IF
IT
WERE
EASY
I
SUPPOSE
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SOLVED
BEFORE
WE
HAVE
TRIED
TO
DO
MORE
IN
THE
LAST
DAYS
THAN
WAS
PREVIOUSLY
DONE
IT
HAS
CLEARLY
NOT
BEEN
ENOUGH
TO
STOP
THE
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
AND
WE
ARE
NOW
LOOKING
AT
WHAT
ELSE
WE
CAN
DO
Q
YESTERDAY
YOU
SPECIFICALLY
CRITICIZED
THE
ROOSEVELT
ADMINISTRATION
FOR
NOT
HAVING
BOMBED
THE
RAILROADS
TO
THE
CONCENTRATION
CAMPS
AND
THINGS
THAT
WERE
NEAR
MILITARY
TARGETS
ARENT
THERE
STEPS
LIKE
THAT
THAT
WOULD
NOT
INVOLVE
CONFLICT
DIRECT
CONFLICT
OR
PARTISAN
BELLIGERENCE
THAT
YOU
MIGHT
CONSIDER
THE
PRESIDENT
THERE
MAY
BE
I
WOULD
REMIND
YOU
THAT
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE
SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT
WE
WERE
THEN
AT
WAR
WITH
GERMANY
AT
THE
TIME
AND
THATS
WHAT
MADE
THAT
WHOLE
INCIDENT
SO
SERIES
OF
INCIDENTS
SO
PERPLEXING
BUT
WE
HAVE
AS
I
SAY
WEVE
GOT
ALL
OF
OUR
OPTIONS
UNDER
REVIEW
Q
THE
DIPLOMATIC
INITIATIVE
ON
HAITI
IS
ON
THE
VERGE
OF
COLLAPSE
WHAT
CAN
YOU
DO
TO
SALVAGE
IT
SHORT
OF
A
FULLSCALE
MILITARY
OPERATION
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
YOU
MAY
KNOW
SOMETHING
I
DONT
THATS
NOT
WHAT
OUR
PEOPLE
TELL
ME
I
THINK
MR
CAPUTO
AND
AMBASSADOR
PEZZULLO
HAVE
DONE
TOGETHER
A
GOOD
JOB
THE
THING
KEEPS
GOING
BACK
AND
FORTH
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
INVOLVED
WITH
THE
DE
FACTO
GOVERNMENT
THERE
ITS
OBVIOUS
WHAT
THEIR
CONCERNS
ARE
THEY
WERE
THE
SAME
CONCERNS
THAT
LED
TO
THE
OUSTER
OF
ARISTIDE
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
PRESIDENT
ARISTIDE
WE
FEEL
SHOULD
BE
RESTORED
TO
POWER
WERE
WORKING
TOWARD
THAT
I
GET
A
REPORT
ON
THAT
WE
DISCUSS
IT
AT
LEAST
THREE
TIMES
A
WEEK
AND
IM
CONVINCED
THAT
WERE
GOING
TO
PREVAIL
THERE
AND
BE
SUCCESSFUL
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
THERES
EVERY
REASON
TO
THINK
THAT
THERE
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
SOME
SORT
OF
MULTILATERAL
PRESENCE
TO
TRY
TO
GUARANTEE
THE
SECURITY
AND
THE
FREEDOM
FROM
VIOLENCE
OF
PEOPLE
ON
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
LEDGER
WHILE
WE
TRY
TO
ESTABLISH
THE
CONDITIONS
OF
ONGOING
CIVILIZED
SOCIETY
BUT
I
BELIEVE
WERE
GOING
TO
PREVAIL
THERE
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
WOULD
YOU
CARE
TO
MAKE
YOUR
ASSESSMENT
OF
THE
FIRST
DAYS
BEFORE
WE
MAKE
ONE
FOR
YOU
LAUGHTER
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
ILL
SAY
IF
I
BELIEVE
FIRST
OF
ALL
WE
PASSED
THE
BUDGET
RESOLUTION
IN
RECORD
TIME
THAT
WAS
THE
BIGGEST
ISSUE
THAT
CONFIRMED
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
ADMINISTRATION
AND
CONFIRMED
THE
COMMITMENTS
OF
THE
CAMPAIGN
THAT
WE
COULD
BOTH
BRING
THE
DEFICIT
DOWN
AND
INCREASE
INVESTMENT
AND
THAT
WE
COULD
DO
IT
BY
SPECIFIC
SPENDING
CUTS
AND
BY
RAISING
TAXES
ALMOST
ALL
OF
WHICH
COME
FROM
THE
HIGHEST
INCOME
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
SOCIETY
REVERSING
A
TREND
IN
WHICH
MOST
OF
THE
TAX
BURDENS
WERE
BORNE
BY
THE
MIDDLE
CLASS
WHOSE
INCOMES
WERE
GOING
DOWN
WHEN
THEIR
TAXES
WERE
GOING
UP
WHILE
THE
DEFICIT
WENT
FROM
TRILLION
TO
TRILLION
THE
TOTAL
NATIONAL
DEBT
AND
THE
DEFICIT
CONTINUED
TO
GO
UP
WE
HAVE
A
LOW
IN
INTEREST
RATES
FROM
MORTGAGES
WE
HAVE
LOWER
INTEREST
RATES
ACROSS
THE
BOARD
WE
HAVE
TENS
OF
BILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
FLOODING
BACK
INTO
THIS
ECONOMY
AS
PEOPLE
REFINANCE
THEIR
DEBT
WE
HAVE
ESTABLISHED
A
NEW
ENVIRONMENTAL
POLICY
WHICH
IS
DRAMATICALLY
DIFFERENT
THE
SECRETARY
OF
EDUCATION
HAS
WORKED
WITH
ME
AND
WITH
OTHERS
AND
WITH
THE
GOVERNORS
TO
ESTABLISH
A
NEW
APPROACH
IN
EDUCATION
THAT
FOCUSES
ON
TOUGH
STANDARDS
AS
WELL
AS
INCREASING
OPPORTUNITY
WE
HAVE
DONE
AN
ENORMOUS
AMOUNT
OF
WORK
ON
POLITICAL
REFORM
ON
CAMPAIGN
FINANCE
AND
LOBBYING
REFORM
AND
I
HAVE
IMPOSED
TOUGH
ETHICS
REQUIREMENTS
ON
MY
OWN
ADMINISTRATIONS
OFFICIALS
THESE
THINGS
ARE
CONSISTENT
WITH
NOT
ONLY
WHAT
I
SAID
ID
DO
IN
THE
CAMPAIGN
BUT
WITH
TURNING
THE
COUNTRY
AROUND
THE
VICE
PRESIDENT
IS
HEADING
A
TASK
FORCE
WHICH
WILL
LITERALLY
CHANGE
THE
WAY
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
OPERATES
AND
MAKE
IT
MUCH
MORE
RESPONSIVE
TO
THE
CITIZENS
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
WE
ARE
WORKING
ON
A
WHOLE
RANGE
OF
OTHER
THINGS
THE
WELFARE
REFORM
INITIATIVE
TO
MOVE
PEOPLE
FROM
WELFARE
TO
WORK
AND
OF
COURSE
A
MASSIVE
AMOUNT
OF
WORK
HAS
BEEN
DONE
ON
THE
HEALTH
CARE
ISSUE
WHICH
IS
A
HUGE
ECONOMIC
AND
PERSONAL
SECURITY
PROBLEM
FOR
MILLIONS
OF
AMERICANS
SO
I
THINK
IT
IS
AMAZING
HOW
MUCH
HAS
BEEN
DONE
MORE
WILL
BE
DONE
WE
ALSO
PASSED
THE
FAMILY
LEAVE
BILL
A
VERSION
OF
THE
MOTOR
VOTER
BILL
THAT
HAS
NOT
COME
OUT
OF
CONFERENCE
BACK
TO
ME
YET
AND
EVERYTHING
HAS
BEEN
PASSED
EXCEPT
THE
STIMULUS
PROGRAM
SO
I
THINK
WERE
DOING
FINE
AND
WERE
MOVING
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
I
FEEL
GOOD
ABOUT
IT
Q
SIR
A
FOLLOWUP
WOULDNT
YOU
SAY
THOUGH
THAT
ONE
OF
YOUR
BIGGEST
INITIATIVES
AID
TO
SOVIET
RUSSIA
IS
NOW
PRACTICALLY
FINISHED
IF
WE
CANT
PASS
A
STIMULUS
BILL
IN
OUR
OWN
COUNTRY
HOW
CAN
WE
DO
IT
FOR
THEM
THE
PRESIDENT
LET
ME
RECAST
THE
QUESTION
A
LITTLE
BIT
ITS
A
GOOD
QUESTION
LAUGHTER
ITS
A
GOOD
QUESTION
BUT
TO
BE
FAIR
WEVE
GOT
TO
RECAST
IT
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
THE
FIRST
ROUND
OF
AID
TO
THE
SOVIET
TO
NONSOVIET
RUSSIA
TO
A
DEMOCRATIC
RUSSIA
IS
PLAINLY
GOING
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
FIRST
BILLION
THE
AID
THAT
WE
AGREED
WITH
OUR
PARTNERS
IN
THE
TO
PROVIDE
THROUGH
THE
INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS
WHICH
IS
A
BIG
DOLLAR
ITEM
IS
PLAINLY
GOING
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
QUESTION
IS
CAN
WE
GET
ANY
MORE
AID
FOR
RUSSIA
THAT
REQUIRES
A
NEW
APPROPRIATION
BY
THE
UNITED
STATES
CONGRESS
AND
THAT
IS
A
QUESTION
I
THINK
MARY
THAT
WILL
BE
RESOLVED
IN
THE
WEEKS
AHEAD
IN
PART
BY
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
THE
AMERICAN
WORKERS
AND
THEIR
JOBS
AND
THEIR
FUTURE
I
THINK
THE
TWO
THINGS
WILL
BE
TIED
BY
MANY
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS
Q
THE
TAILHOOK
REPORT
CAME
OUT
THIS
MORNING
DOCUMENTING
HORRENDOUS
AND
NEARLYCRIMINAL
CONDUCT
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
NAVY
HOW
MUCH
DID
YOU
DISCUSS
THE
INCIDENT
AND
WHAT
MIGHT
BE
DONE
ABOUT
IT
WITH
YOUR
NOMINEE
TO
BE
THE
SECRETARY
OF
THE
NAVY
THE
PRESIDENT
FIRST
LET
ME
COMMENT
A
LITTLE
ON
THAT
THE
INSPECTOR
GENERALS
REPORT
DETAILS
CONDUCT
WHICH
IS
WRONG
AND
WHICH
HAS
NO
PLACE
IN
THE
ARMED
SERVICES
AND
I
EXPECT
THE
REPORT
TO
BE
ACTED
ON
IN
THE
APPROPRIATE
WAY
I
ALSO
WANT
TO
SAY
TO
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
AND
TO
ALL
OF
YOU
THAT
THE
REPORT
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
FOR
WHAT
IT
IS
A
VERY
DISTURBING
LIST
OF
ALLEGATIONS
WHICH
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
THOROUGHLY
EXAMINED
IT
SHOULD
NOT
BE
TAKEN
AS
A
GENERAL
INDICTMENT
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
NAVY
OR
OF
ALL
THE
FINE
PEOPLE
WHO
SERVE
THERE
IT
IS
VERY
SPECIFIC
IN
ITS
ALLEGATIONS
AND
IT
WILL
BE
PURSUED
THE
ONLY
THING
I
SAID
TO
THE
SECRETARYDESIGNATE
OF
THE
NAVY
AND
THE
ONLY
THING
I
SHOULD
HAVE
SAID
TO
HIM
I
THINK
IS
THAT
I
EXPECTED
HIM
TO
TAKE
THE
REPORT
AND
TO
DO
HIS
DUTY
AND
I
BELIEVE
HE
WILL
DO
THAT
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
TO
BACK
TO
RUSSIA
FOR
JUST
A
MINUTE
THE
LATEST
POLL
SHOW
THAT
MR
YELTSIN
WILL
PROBABLY
WIN
HIS
VOTE
OF
CONFIDENCE
BUT
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
REAL
TOSSUP
ON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
VOTERS
ARE
GOING
TO
ENDORSE
HIS
ECONOMIC
REFORMS
THE
PRESIDENT
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
Q
CAN
YOU
LIVE
WITH
A
SPLIT
LAUGHTER
CAN
YOU
LIVE
WITH
A
SPLIT
DECISION
THOUGH
OR
DO
YOU
NEED
BOTH
PASSED
IN
ORDER
TO
THEN
BUILD
SUPPORT
FOR
RUSSIAN
AID
THE
PRESIDENT
I
BELIEVE
THE
ANSWER
TO
YOUR
QUESTION
IS
FOR
THE
UNITED
STATES
THE
KEY
QUESTION
SHOULD
BE
THAT
WHICH
IS
POSED
TO
ANY
DEMOCRACY
WHICH
IS
WHO
WINS
THE
ELECTION
IF
HE
WINS
THE
ELECTION
IF
HE
IS
RATIFIED
BY
THE
RUSSIAN
PEOPLE
TO
CONTINUE
AS
THEIR
PRESIDENT
THEN
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
DO
OUR
BEST
TO
WORK
WITH
HIM
TOWARD
REFORM
YOU
KNOW
WE
HAD
A
LOT
OF
OTHER
COUNTRIES
HERE
FOR
THE
HOLOCAUST
MUSEUM
DEDICATION
THEIR
LEADERS
WERE
HERE
LEADERS
FROM
EASTERN
EUROPE
LEADERS
FROM
AT
LEAST
ONE
REPUBLIC
OF
THE
FORMER
SOVIET
UNION
ALL
OF
THEM
HAVING
TERRIBLE
ECONOMIC
CHALLENGES
AS
THEY
CONVERT
FROM
A
COMMUNIST
COMMAND
AND
CONTROL
ECONOMY
TO
A
MARKET
ECONOMY
IN
A
WORLD
WHERE
THERES
ECONOMIC
SLOWDOWN
EVERYWHERE
AND
IN
A
WORLD
IN
WHICH
THERES
ECONOMIC
SLOWDOWN
AND
DIFFICULTY
ALL
LEADERS
WILL
HAVE
TROUBLE
HAVING
THEIR
POLICIES
BE
POPULAR
IN
A
POLL
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVENT
PRODUCED
THE
RESULTS
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
SO
EARNESTLY
YEARN
FOR
YOU
CAN
UNDERSTAND
THAT
BUT
IF
THEY
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
LEADERSHIP
I
THINK
THATS
ALL
WE
CAN
ASK
AND
THE
UNITED
STATES
WILL
IF
THE
RUSSIAN
PEOPLE
RATIFY
HIM
AS
THEIR
PRESIDENT
AND
STICK
WITH
HIM
THEN
THE
UNITED
STATES
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
WITH
HIM
I
THINK
HE
IS
A
GENUINE
DEMOCRAT
SMALL
D
AND
GENUINELY
COMMITTED
TO
REFORM
I
THINK
THAT
WE
SHOULD
SUPPORT
THAT
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
MR
PEROT
HAS
COME
OUT
STRONGLY
IN
WHAT
IS
PERCEIVED
BEHIND
THE
LINE
AGAINST
A
FREE
TRADE
AGREEMENT
NAFTA
HOW
HARD
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
FIGHT
FOR
THIS
FREE
TRADE
AGREEMENT
AND
WHEN
DO
YOU
EXPECT
TO
SEE
IT
ACCOMPLISHED
THE
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
WELL
HAVE
THE
AGREEMENT
READY
IN
THE
FAIRLY
NEAR
FUTURE
YOU
KNOW
OUR
PEOPLE
ARE
STILL
WORKING
WITH
THE
MEXICAN
GOVERNMENT
AND
WITH
THE
CANADIANS
ON
THE
SIDE
AGREEMENTS
WERE
TRYING
TO
WORK
OUT
WHAT
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
AGREEMENT
WILL
SAY
WHAT
THE
LABOR
AGREEMENT
WILL
SAY
AND
THEN
WHAT
THE
FAIREST
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
ENFORCEMENT
IS
THE
MEXICANS
SAY
AND
THERE
IS
SOME
MERIT
TO
THEIR
POSITION
THAT
THEYRE
WORRIED
ABOUT
TRANSFERRING
THEIR
SOVEREIGNTY
IN
ENFORCEMENT
TO
A
MULTILATERAL
COMMISSION
EVEN
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
TO
BE
FAIR
WE
HAVE
SOME
FOLKS
WHO
ARE
WORRIED
ABOUT
THAT
ABOUT
GIVING
THAT
UP
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
WERE
GOING
TO
HAVE
AN
ENVIRONMENTAL
AGREEMENT
AND
A
LABOR
STANDARDS
AGREEMENT
THAT
MEANS
SOMETHING
THEN
THERE
HAS
TO
BE
ULTIMATELY
SOME
CONSEQUENCES
FOR
VIOLATING
THEM
SO
WHAT
WERE
TRYING
TO
DO
IS
TO
AGREE
ON
AN
APPROACH
WHICH
WOULD
SAY
THAT
IF
THERE
IS
A
PATTERN
OF
VIOLATIONS
IF
YOU
KEEP
ON
VIOLATING
IT
PAST
A
CERTAIN
POINT
MAYBE
NOT
AN
ISOLATED
INCIDENT
BUT
A
PATTERN
OF
VIOLATION
THERE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
SOME
ENFORCEMENT
THERE
MUST
BE
CONSEQUENCES
AND
WERE
WORKING
OUT
THE
DETAILS
OF
THAT
BUT
I
STILL
FEEL
QUITE
GOOD
ABOUT
IT
AND
THIS
IS
JUST
AN
AREA
WHERE
I
DISAGREE
WITH
MR
PEROT
AND
WITH
OTHERS
I
THINK
THAT
WE
WILL
WIN
BIG
IF
WE
HAVE
A
FAIR
AGREEMENT
THAT
INTEGRATES
MORE
CLOSELY
THE
MEXICAN
ECONOMY
AND
THE
AMERICAN
ECONOMY
AND
LEADS
US
FROM
THERE
TO
CHILE
TO
OTHER
MARKET
ECONOMIES
IN
LATIN
AMERICA
AND
GIVES
US
A
BIGGER
WORLD
IN
WHICH
TO
TRADE
I
THINK
THATS
THE
ONLY
WAY
A
RICH
COUNTRY
CAN
GROW
RICHER
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
WHAT
JAPAN
AND
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
THE
PACIFIC
ARE
DOING
TO
REACH
OUT
IN
THEIR
OWN
REGION
ITS
A
PRETTY
GOOD
LESSON
TO
US
THAT
WE
HAD
BETTER
WORRY
ABOUT
HOW
TO
BUILD
THOSE
BRIDGES
IN
OUR
OWN
AREA
SO
THIS
IS
AN
IDEA
BATTLE
YOU
KNOW
YOUVE
GOT
A
LOT
OF
QUESTIONS
AND
I
WANT
TO
ANSWER
THEM
ALL
BUT
LET
ME
SAY
NOT
EVERY
ONE
OF
THESE
THINGS
CAN
BE
DISTILLED
SIMPLY
INTO
POLITICS
YOU
KNOW
WHOS
FOR
THIS
AND
WHOS
FOR
THAT
AND
IF
THIS
PERSON
IS
FOR
THIS
SOMEBODY
ELSE
HAS
GOT
TO
BE
FOR
THAT
A
LOT
OF
THESE
THINGS
HONESTLY
INVOLVED
REAL
DEBATES
OVER
IDEAS
OVER
WHOS
RIGHT
AND
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
WORLD
TOWARD
WHICH
WERE
MOVING
AND
THE
ANSWERS
ARE
NOT
SELFEVIDENT
AND
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
THAT
I
WANTED
TO
RUN
FOR
PRESIDENT
IS
I
WANTED
TO
SORT
OF
OPEN
THE
FLOODGATES
FOR
DEBATING
THESE
IDEAS
SO
THAT
WE
COULD
TRY
TO
CHANGE
IN
THE
APPROPRIATE
WAY
SO
I
JUST
HAVE
A
DIFFERENCE
OF
OPINION
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
NAFTA
IS
SOUND
EVEN
THOUGH
AS
YOU
KNOW
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
DETAILS
NEEDED
TO
BE
IMPROVED
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
THERE
WAS
A
TREMENDOUS
FLURRY
OF
INTEREST
EARLIER
THIS
MONTH
IN
THE
RUSSIAN
DOCUMENT
THAT
PURPORTED
TO
SHOW
THAT
THE
VIETNAMESE
HAD
HELD
BACK
AMERICAN
PRISONERS
GENERAL
VESSEY
HAS
NOW
SAID
PUBLICLY
THAT
WHILE
THE
DOCUMENT
ITSELF
WAS
AUTHENTIC
HE
BELIEVES
THAT
IT
WAS
INCORRECT
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
PERSONAL
VIEW
AT
THIS
POINT
ABOUT
THAT
ISSUE
AND
MORE
BROADLY
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
IN
FACT
THE
VIETNAMESE
DID
RETURN
ALL
THE
AMERICAN
PRISONERS
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
PARIS
PEACE
ACCORD
THE
PRESIDENT
FIRST
LET
ME
SAY
I
SAW
GENERAL
VESSEY
BEFORE
HE
WENT
TO
VIETNAM
AND
AFTER
HE
RETURNED
AND
I
HAVE
A
HIGH
REGARD
FOR
HIM
AND
I
APPRECIATE
HIS
WILLINGNESS
TO
SERVE
HIS
COUNTRY
IN
THIS
WAY
AS
TO
WHETHER
THE
DOCUMENT
HAD
ANY
BASIS
IN
FACT
LET
ME
SAY
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
VIETNAM
WAS
MORE
FORTHCOMING
THAN
IT
HAD
BEEN
IN
THE
PAST
AND
GAVE
US
SOME
DOCUMENTS
THAT
WOULD
TEND
TO
UNDERMINE
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THE
RUSSIAN
DOCUMENTS
CLAIM
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHETHER
THAT
IS
RIGHT
OR
WRONG
WE
ARE
HAVING
IT
BASICALLY
EVALUATED
AT
THIS
TIME
AND
WHEN
WE
COMPLETE
THE
EVALUATION
WELL
TELL
YOU
AND
OF
COURSE
WE
WANT
TO
TELL
THE
FAMILIES
OF
THOSE
WHO
WERE
MISSING
IN
ACTION
OR
WHO
WERE
POWS
I
THINK
THAT
WELL
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
SOME
PROGRESS
IN
ELIMINATING
SOME
OF
THE
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
OUTSTANDING
CASES
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THIS
LAST
INTERCHANGE
BUT
I
CANNOT
SAY
THAT
IM
FULLY
SATISFIED
THAT
WE
KNOW
ALL
THAT
WE
NEED
TO
KNOW
THERE
ARE
STILL
SOME
CASES
THAT
WE
DONT
KNOW
THE
ANSWER
TO
BUT
I
DO
BELIEVE
WERE
MAKING
SOME
PROGRESS
I
WAS
ENCOURAGED
BY
THE
LAST
TRIP
Q
ID
LIKE
TO
FOLLOW
UP
ON
THAT
BEFORE
THE
US
NORMALIZES
RELATIONS
ALLOWS
TRADE
TO
GO
FORWARD
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
PERSONALLY
SURE
THAT
EVERY
CASE
HAS
BEEN
RESOLVED
OR
WOULD
YOU
BE
WILLING
TO
GO
FORWARD
ON
THE
BASIS
THAT
WHILE
IT
MAY
TAKE
YEARS
TO
RESOLVE
THESE
CASES
THE
VIETNAMESE
HAVE
MADE
SUFFICIENT
OFFERINGS
TO
US
TO
CONFIRM
GOOD
FAITH
THE
PRESIDENT
A
LOT
OF
EXPERTS
SAY
YOU
CAN
NEVER
RESOLVE
EVERY
CASE
EVERY
ONE
THAT
WE
COULDNT
RESOLVE
ALL
THE
CASES
FOR
THEM
AND
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL
SOME
CASES
THAT
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
FACTUALLY
RESOLVED
GOING
BACK
TO
THE
SECOND
WORLD
WAR
BUT
WHAT
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
CONVINCED
OF
IS
THAT
WE
HAD
GONE
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARD
RESOLVING
EVERY
CASE
THAT
COULD
BE
RESOLVED
AT
THIS
MOMENT
IN
TIME
AND
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
COMPLETE
OPEN
AND
UNRESTRICTED
COMMITMENT
TO
CONTINUE
TO
DO
EVERYTHING
THAT
COULD
BE
DONE
ALWAYS
TO
KEEP
RESOLVING
THOSE
CASES
AND
WERE
NOT
THERE
YET
AGAIN
I
HAVE
TO
BE
GUIDED
A
LITTLE
BIT
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
KNOW
A
LOT
ABOUT
THIS
AND
I
CONFESS
TO
BEING
MUCH
MORE
HEAVILY
INFLUENCED
BY
THE
FAMILIES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHOSE
LIVES
WERE
LOST
THERE
OR
WHOSE
LIVES
REMAIN
IN
QUESTION
THAN
BY
THE
COMMERCIAL
INTEREST
AND
THE
OTHER
THINGS
WHICH
SEEM
SO
COMPELLING
IN
THIS
MOMENT
I
JUST
AM
VERY
INFLUENCED
BY
HOW
THE
FAMILIES
FEEL
Q
YOUR
ECONOMIC
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
ARE
YOU
DOING
SOME
KIND
OF
REALITY
CHECK
NOW
AND
SCALING
BACK
SOME
OF
YOUR
PLANS
YOUR
LEGISLATIVE
PLANS
FOR
THE
COMING
YEAR
INCLUDING
THE
CRIME
BILL
THE
HEALTH
CARE
INITIATIVE
AND
OTHER
THINGS
ARE
THERE
ANY
PLANS
TO
DO
THAT
AND
ALSO
DID
YOU
UNDERESTIMATE
THE
POWER
OF
SENATOR
BOB
DOLE
THE
PRESIDENT
NO
WHAT
I
UNDERESTIMATED
WAS
THE
EXTENT
TO
WHICH
WHAT
I
THOUGHT
WAS
A
FAIRLY
SELFEVIDENT
CASE
PARTICULARLY
AFTER
WE
STAYED
BELOW
THE
SPENDING
CAPS
APPROVED
BY
THIS
CONGRESS
INCLUDING
THE
REPUBLICANS
WHO
WERE
IN
THIS
CONGRESS
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
WE
HAD
ALREADY
PASSED
A
BUDGET
RESOLUTION
WHICH
CALLED
FOR
OVER
BILLION
IN
DEFICIT
REDUCTION
WHEN
THEY
HAD
VOTED
REPEATEDLY
FOR
SUPPLEMENTAL
APPROPRIATIONS
TO
HELP
FOREIGN
GOVERNMENTS
I
THOUGHT
AT
LEAST
FOUR
OF
THEM
WOULD
VOTE
TO
BREAK
CLOTURE
AND
I
UNDERESTIMATED
THAT
I
DID
NOT
HAVE
AN
ADEQUATE
STRATEGY
OF
DEALING
WITH
THAT
I
ALSO
THOUGHT
THAT
IF
I
MADE
A
GOODFAITH
EFFORT
TO
NEGOTIATE
AND
TO
COMPROMISE
THAT
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
REBUFFED
INSTEAD
EVERY
TIME
I
OFFERED
SOMETHING
THEY
REDUCED
THE
OFFER
THAT
THEY
HAD
PREVIOUSLY
BEEN
TALKING
TO
THE
MAJORITY
LEADER
ABOUT
SO
IT
WAS
A
STRANGE
SET
OF
EVENTS
BUT
I
THINK
WHAT
HAPPENED
WAS
WHAT
WAS
A
SIGNIFICANT
PART
OF
OUR
PLAN
BUT
NOT
THE
MAJOR
PART
OF
IT
ACQUIRED
A
POLITICAL
CONNOTATION
THAT
GOT
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
TO
THE
MERITS
SO
THAT
A
LOT
OF
REPUBLICANS
WERE
SAYING
TO
ME
PRIVATELY
MR
PRESIDENT
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
FOR
THIS
BUT
I
CANT
NOW
AND
WERE
ALL
STRUNG
OUT
AND
WERE
DIVIDED
AND
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
DO
A
REALITY
CHECK
AS
I
SAID
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
LET
ME
GO
BACK
TO
WHAT
I
SAID
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
FROM
OUR
FOLKS
AND
FROM
OUR
FRIENDS
IN
THE
SENATE
ON
AND
REPUBLICANS
OR
DEMOCRATS
IS
WHAT
COULD
I
HAVE
DONE
DIFFERENTLY
TO
MAKE
IT
COME
OUT
DIFFERENTLY
BECAUSE
THE
REAL
LOSERS
HERE
WERE
NOT
THE
PRESIDENT
AND
THE
ADMINISTRATION
THE
REAL
LOSERS
WERE
THE
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
WONT
HAVE
JOBS
NOW
WE
COULD
HAVE
PUT
ANOTHER
KIDS
TO
WORK
THIS
SUMMER
I
MEAN
WE
COULD
HAVE
DONE
A
LOT
OF
GOOD
THINGS
WITH
THAT
MONEY
AND
I
THINK
THAT
IS
VERY
VERY
SAD
AND
IT
BECAME
MORE
POLITICAL
THAN
IT
SHOULD
HAVE
BUT
THE
UNDERLYING
RATIONALE
I
DONT
THINK
HOLDS
A
LOT
OF
WATER
THAT
IT
WAS
DEFICIT
SPENDING
THAT
JUST
WONT
WASH
Q
AND
REDO
THE
PRESIDENT
NO
I
MEAN
YOU
KNOW
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
MENTIONED
THE
CRIME
BILL
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
A
REAL
MISTAKE
NOT
TO
PASS
THE
CRIME
BILL
I
MEAN
THE
CRIME
BILL
WAS
ALMOST
ON
THE
POINT
OF
PASSAGE
LAST
YEAR
AND
THEY
WERE
ALL
FIGHTING
OVER
THE
BRADY
BILL
SURELY
SURELY
AFTER
WHAT
WE
HAVE
BEEN
THROUGH
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
JUST
IN
THE
LAST
THREE
MONTHS
WITH
THE
KIND
OF
MINDLESS
VIOLENCE
WE
HAVE
SEEN
WE
CAN
PASS
A
BILL
REQUIRING
PEOPLE
TO
GO
THROUGH
A
WAITING
PERIOD
BEFORE
THEY
BUY
A
HANDGUN
AND
SURELY
WE
CAN
SEE
THAT
WE
NEED
MORE
POLICE
OFFICERS
ON
THE
STREET
THATS
ANOTHER
THING
THAT
I
REALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
ONCE
WE
MOVE
SOME
OF
THAT
MONEY
NOT
ALL
BUT
SOME
OF
IT
UP
INTO
THIS
JOBS
PACKAGE
TO
MAKE
SOME
OF
THE
JOBS
REHIRING
POLICE
OFFICERS
ON
THE
STREET
WHOD
BEEN
LAID
OFF
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
COMPELLING
CASE
I
MEAN
PEOPLE
ARE
SCARED
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
GO
FORWARD
I
FEEL
VERY
STRONGLY
THAT
WE
NEED
TO
GO
FORWARD
ON
THE
CRIME
BILL
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
BACK
TO
THE
TAILHOOK
REPORT
FOR
A
SECOND
THAT
REPORT
CONTAINED
VERY
STRONG
CRITICISM
OF
THE
NAVYS
SENIOR
LEADERSHIP
IN
GENERAL
BUT
DID
NOT
NAME
ANY
OF
THE
SENIOR
OFFICERS
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
SENIOR
OFFICERS
WHO
ARE
IMPLICATED
IN
THIS
INCLUDING
ADMIRAL
KELSO
WHO
WAS
THERE
ONE
NIGHT
IN
LAS
VEGAS
SHOULD
THEY
BE
DISCIPLINED
AND
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THE
PUBLIC
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
KNOW
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
SENIOR
OFFICERS
THE
PRESIDENT
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
UNDER
THE
RULES
OF
LAW
WHICH
APPLY
TO
THIS
I
AM
IN
THE
CHAIN
OF
COMMAND
THERE
IS
NOW
AN
INSPECTOR
GENERALS
REPORT
AND
THE
LAW
MUST
TAKE
ITS
COURSE
IF
I
WERE
TO
ANSWER
THAT
QUESTION
I
MIGHT
PREJUDICE
ANY
DECISIONS
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
LATER
MADE
IN
THIS
CASE
I
DONT
REALLY
THINK
I
THINK
ALL
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
IS
WHAT
I
HAVE
ALREADY
SAID
I
WAS
VERY
DISTURBED
BY
THE
SPECIFIC
ALLEGATIONS
IN
THE
INSPECTOR
GENERALS
REPORT
AND
I
WANT
APPROPRIATE
ACTION
TO
BE
TAKEN
UNTIL
THE
PROPER
PROCEDURES
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
KICK
IN
AND
APPROPRIATE
ACTION
IS
TAKEN
I
HAVE
BEEN
ADVISED
THAT
BECAUSE
I
AM
THE
COMMANDERINCHIEF
I
HAVE
TO
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
ABOUT
WHAT
I
SAY
SO
AS
NOT
TO
PREJUDICE
THE
RIGHTS
OF
ANYBODY
AGAINST
WHOM
ANY
ACTION
MIGHT
PROCEED
OR
TO
PREJUDICE
THE
CASE
IN
ANY
OTHER
WAY
EITHER
PRO
OR
CON
SO
I
CANT
SAY
ANY
MORE
EXCEPT
TO
SAY
THAT
I
WANT
THIS
THING
HANDLED
IN
AN
APPROPRIATE
AND
THOROUGH
WAY
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
COULD
I
ASK
YOU
FOR
A
CLARIFICATION
ON
BOSNIA
YOU
SAID
THAT
YOU
WERE
NOT
CONSIDERING
INTRODUCTION
OF
AMERICAN
FORCES
DOES
THAT
INCLUDE
ANY
AIR
FORCES
AS
WELL
AS
GROUND
FORCES
SIR
THE
PRESIDENT
I
SAID
GROUND
FORCES
Q
YOU
SAID
GROUND
FORCES
COULD
I
ASK
YOU
SIR
IF
YOU
FEAR
THAT
USING
US
AIR
STRIKES
MIGHT
DRAW
THE
UNITED
STATES
INTO
A
GROUND
WAR
THERE
THE
PRESIDENT
I
JUST
DONT
WANT
TO
DISCUSS
OUR
EVALUATION
OF
THE
OPTIONS
ANYMORE
IVE
TOLD
YOU
THAT
THERES
NEVER
BEEN
A
SERIOUS
DISCUSSION
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
ABOUT
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
GROUND
FORCES
INTO
AN
ONGOING
CONFLICT
THERE
Q
WITH
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
GAYS
IN
WASHINGTON
THIS
WEEKEND
FOR
THE
MARCH
DID
YOU
EVER
RECONSIDER
YOUR
DECISION
TO
LEAVE
TOWN
FOR
THIS
WEEKEND
DID
YOU
EVER
CONSIDER
IN
ANY
WAY
PARTICIPATING
IN
SOME
OF
THE
ACTIVITIES
THE
PRESIDENT
NO
Q
WHY
NOT
THE
PRESIDENT
BECAUSE
I
AND
BASICALLY
I
WOULDNT
PARTICIPATE
IN
OTHER
MARCHES
I
THINK
ONCE
YOU
BECOME
PRESIDENT
ON
BALANCE
EXCEPT
UNDER
UNUSUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
DONE
BUT
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
IM
GOING
TO
THE
AMERICAN
SOCIETY
OF
NEWSPAPER
EDITORS
A
TRIP
THAT
PRESUMABLY
MOST
OF
YOU
WOULD
WANT
ME
TO
MAKE
TO
TRY
TO
FOCUS
ANEW
ON
WHAT
I
THINK
ARE
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
ISSUES
AT
STAKE
FOR
OUR
COUNTRY
RIGHT
NOW
AND
I
EXPECT
THAT
I
WILL
SAY
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
A
LOT
OF
AMERICANS
HAVE
COME
HERE
ASKING
FOR
A
CLIMATE
THAT
IS
FREE
OF
DISCRIMINATION
ASKING
BASICALLY
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
WORK
HARD
AND
LIVE
BY
THE
RULES
AND
BE
TREATED
LIKE
OTHER
AMERICAN
CITIZENS
IF
THEY
DO
THAT
AND
JUST
THAT
AND
THATS
ALWAYS
BEEN
MY
POSITION
NOT
ONLY
FOR
THE
GAYS
WHO
WILL
BE
HERE
BUT
FOR
OTHERS
AS
WELL
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
