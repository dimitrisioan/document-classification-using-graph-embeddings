WACO
I
DONT
WANT
TO
ATTACK
ANYONES
PERSONAL
OPINIONS
AND
THUS
HAVE
NOT
INCLUDED
ANY
ARTICLES
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
INCREDIBLY
RIDICULOUS
AND
POMPOUS
FOR
SOMEONE
TO
SIT
BACK
WITH
THE
BENEFIT
OF
HINDSIGHT
AND
POINT
FINGERS
AT
CLINTON
RENO
THE
FBI
OR
WHOMEVER
FIRST
OF
ALL
IT
IS
A
KNEEJERK
JUDGEMENT
THE
FACTS
ARE
QUITE
MUDDLED
AT
THIS
POINT
AND
WILL
LIKELY
BE
FOR
QUITE
A
WHILE
SECONDLY
THINGS
DO
NOT
IMPROVE
BY
POINTING
BLAME
AND
ACCUSATORY
FINGERS
POINTING
FINGERS
IS
A
DESTRUCTIVE
ACTION
IF
EVERYONE
SAT
AROUND
POINTING
FINGERS
ALL
THE
TIME
NOTHING
WOULD
GET
DONE
AND
NOTHING
WOULD
EVER
GET
ANY
BETTER
AND
DESPITE
THE
TRAGEDY
WE
CAN
LEARN
SOMETHING
FROM
THIS
IF
IT
IS
APPROACHED
IN
A
CONSTRUCTIVE
MANNER
DOESNT
IT
SEEM
THAT
WORKING
TOGETHER
IS
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
THAN
WORKING
AGAINST
ONE
ANOTHER
THIRDLY
IT
SEEMS
INCREDIBLY
HYPOCRITICAL
TO
PLACE
BLAME
GIVEN
THE
BENEFIT
OF
HINDSIGHT
SOMETHING
THAT
THOSE
WHO
MADE
THE
DECISIONS
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
BENEFIT
OF
WHY
NOT
GIVE
THEM
THE
COURTESY
OF
ACKNOWLEDGING
THAT
THEY
DID
THE
BEST
THEY
COULD
WITH
THE
DATA
THEY
HAD
IN
A
VERY
VERY
DIFFICULT
SITUATION
SOME
RESPONSES
HAVE
GONE
SO
FAR
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
ACTIONS
WERE
DONE
WITHOUT
REGARD
FOR
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
BE
PART
OF
THE
SOLUTION
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
AND
THATS
MY
OPINION
