ONE

SYSTEM
BS
WRITES
THERE
IS
NEVER
ANY
MENTION
OF
HOW
MUCH
WORKING
CANADIANS
HAVE
TO
PAY
IN
TAXES
FOR
THEIR
FREE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
OH
REALLY
I
KNOW
THAT
MORE
THAN
OF
AN
AVERAGE
DAILY
WORKERS
SALARY
GOES
TOWARDS
TAXES
IN
CANADA
MAINLY
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
FREE
HEALTH
CARE
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
WE
ARE
PRETTY
LUCKY
SO
FAR
I
KNOW
THAT
WHEN
WORKING
IN
ALBERTA
ONTARIO
AND
QUEBEC
I
WAS
AWARE
THAT
I
WAS
PAYING
FOR
HEALTH
INSURANCE
EG
IN
TORONTO
OHIP
FEES
WERE
LISTED
SEPERATELY
ON
MY
PAY
STUB
WHILE
IM
NOT
THE
ONLY
CANADIAN
WHO
FAVOURS
LOWER
TAXES
AND
CUTBACKS
IN
SPENDING
HEALTH
INSURANCE
ISNT
ON
THE
TABLE
SEE
OUR

A
BETTER
ONE
MIGHT
BE
THE
JULY
POLLS
CONDUCTED
FOR

OUR
MAJOR
ENGLISH
NEWSMAGAZINE
BY

DECIMA
PRESIDENT
ALLEN
GREGG
IS
CONSIDERED
ONE
OF
THE
WORLDS
TOP
POLL
RESEARCHERS
AND
MULRONEYS
CONSERVATIVES
HAVE
RELIED
ON
HIM
TO
KEEP
IN
POWER
IN
THE
FACE
OF
IMPOSSIBLE
ELECTION
SITUATIONS
I
HAVENT
HAD
A
CHANCE
TO
SEE
THIS
YEARS
VERSION
DUE
TO
OUR
LIBRARY
BUT
PREVIOUS
ONES
BEFORE
THE
AMERICANS
STARTED
THEIR
ASSAULT
AND
DISINFORMATION
HAD
SHOWN
SATISFACTION
AT
AND
SWITCHING
TO
AN
AMERICAN
ALLPRIVATE
SYSTEM
HAD
SUPPORT
WITHIN
STATISTICAL
NOISE
THE
DECIMA
POLLS
ARE
CONSIDERED
DEFINITIVE
EVEN
THE
NEW
REFORM
PARTY
A
BREAKOFF
OF
TRADITIONALISTS
FROM
THE
CONSERVATIVES
WITH
A
MILDLY
LIBERTARIAN
FACTION
HOLD
OUR
PUBLIC
HEALTH
INSURANCE
AS
AN
UNTOUCHABLE
BUT
THAT
JUST
A
FEW
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
BE
REMINDED
THAT
ITS
NOT
FREE
THE
AVERAGE
CANADIANEUROPEAN
IS
MORE
FISCALLY
NAIVE
THAN
THEIR
AMERICAN
COUNTERPARTS
ON
ISSUES
LIKE
THESE
PERSONALLY
I
FEEL
THAT
THE
UNIVERSAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
APPROACH
USED
IN
CANADA
FRANCE
AND
GERMANY
PAYING
TO
PRIVATE
HEALTH
PROVIDERS
IN
A
NOMINALLY
FREE
MARKET
NOT
UNLIKE
AMERICAS
MINUS
HMOS
DEPENDS
A
LOT
ON
VALUES
IN
THOSE
SOCIETIES
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
US
THE
BASIC
HEALTH
NEEDS
FOR
LIFE
ARE
NOT
VIEWED
AS
MARKET
BUT
THE
INSURANCE
DOES
ALLOW
THE
MARKET
TO
ADDRESS
THAT
BASIC
HEALTH
CARE
IS
NOT
VIEWED
ON
THE
LEVEL
OF
OWNERSHIP
OF
A
VCR
AS
AMERICANS
WOULD
SEE
IT
PLENTY
OF
ROOM
IS
LEFT
FOR
EXPENDITURE
OF
PRIVATE
FUNDS
AS
EXTRA
INSURANCE
OR
AS
LASTLY
THERE
WERE
NOISES
ABOUT
HOW
THE
CANADIAN
SYSTEM
WAS
NOT
CONTAINING
COSTS
BUT
IN
FACT
THEIR
SYSTEM
IS
CURRENTLY
BANKRUPT
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
THIS
ONE
HOPEFULLY
IN
A
WAY
THAT
