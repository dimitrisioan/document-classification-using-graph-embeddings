RE
LAW
AND
ECONOMICS
IM
GOING
TO
BE
MIXING
TOGETHER
HERE
STUFF
FROM
TWO
OF
TED
FRANKS
ARTICLES
WHICH
WAS
A
RESPONSE
TO
ME
AND
A
RESPONSE
TO
TIM
SMITH
YES
I
KNOW
THE
BOOMER
COURT
DIDNT
CALL
IT
EMINENT
DOMAIN
BUT
IF
IT
WALKS
LIKE
EMINENT
DOMAIN
AND
SWIMS
LIKE
EMINENT
DOMAIN
AND
QUACKS
LIKE
EMINENT
DOMAIN
WDSTARR
ARE
ALL
TORT
CASES
REALLY
EMINENT
DOMAIN
CASES
THEN
WHAT
ABOUT
BANKRUPTCY
CONTRACT
EMINENT
DOMAIN
IS
A
STATEMANDATED
TRANSACTION
IN
WHICH
ONE
PARTY
IS
REQUIRED
TO
SELL
A
PIECE
OF
PROPERTY
WHICH
IT
OWNS
TO
ANOTHER
PARTY
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
THE
FIRST
PARTY
WISHES
TO
SELL
AT
ALL
AT
A
PRICE
WHICH
IS
SET
BY
THE
STATE
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
HOW
THIS
DOCTRINE
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
TORT
BANKRUPTCY
OR
CONTRACT
CASES
IN
GENERAL
WELL
OKAY
SORT
OF
IN
BANKRUPTCY
IF
SO
SO
WHAT
SINCE
WHEN
ARE
THE
COURTS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
PREVENTING
PARTIES
FROM
REAPING
WINDFALL
SETTLEMENTS
FROM
OTHER
PARTIES
WHEN
THOSE
SETTLEMENTS
ARISE
FROM
WRONGFUL
ACTS
BY
THOSE
OTHER
PARTIES
WDSTARR
SINCE
YOU
SAID
THAT
BOOMERS
RELIANCE
ON
ECONOMICS
LED
TO
AN
UNJUST
RESULT
IM
POINTING
OUT
THAT
YOUR
ALTERNATIVE
IS
FAR
MORE
UNJUST
IN
THE
TRADITIONAL
SENSE
OF
THE
WORLD
ATLANTIC
CEMENTS
ACT
WAS
NOT
WRONGFUL
IT
DID
SOMETHING
THAT
WE
AS
A
CAPITALISTIC
SOCIETY
SHOULD
WANT
THEM
TO
DO
BUILD
A
FACTORY
CREATE
INDUSTRY
AND
JOBS
THE
COST
OF
COMPLIANCE
WAS
GROSSLY
DISPROPORTIONATE
TO
THE
DAMAGE
FACED
BY
PLAINTIFFS
BANG
HERES
ONE
OF
THE
PLACES
WHERE
WE
WIDELY
DIVERGE
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
COURTS
IN
DECIDING
A
CIVIL
DISPUTE
BETWEEN
TWO
PARTIES
SHOULD
CONSIDER
AS
A
FACTOR
PERHAPS
AS
AN
OVERRIDING
FACTOR
ISSUES
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
THE
COURT
SHOULD
IGNORE
AS
BEING
IRRELEVANT
TO
THE
DISPUTE
BOOMER
V
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
CO
WAS
AN
ACTION
BROUGHT
BY
ONE
PARTY
BOOMER
WHOSE
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
WERE
BEING
VIOLATED
ON
AN
ONGOING
BASIS
BY
ANOTHER
PARTY
THE
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
COMPANY
THE
FACTS
SUPPORTED
BOOMERS
CONTENTION
THAT
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
WAS
WRONGFULLY
DAMAGING
HIS
PROPERTY
AND
BOOMER
ASKED
THE
COURT
TO
ORDER
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
TO
STOP
DOING
SO
END
OF
STORY
THERE
WAS
NO
REASON
FOR
THE
COURT
TO
CONSIDER
SUCH
ISSUES
AS
WHAT
A
CAPITALISTIC
SOCIETY
WOULD
WANT
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
TO
DO
OR
WHETHER
THE
COST
OF
COMPLIANCE
WAS
DISPROPORTIONATE
TO
THE
DAMAGE
FACED
BY
THE
PLAINTIFFS
THOSE
ISSUES
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
CASE
BEFORE
THE
COURT
BILL
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAD
STEPPED
IN
AND
THE
EPA
MADE
A
REGULATION
REQUIRING
MULTIMILLION
DOLLAR
CEMENT
PLANTS
TO
BE
SHUT
DOWN
BECAUSE
OF
A
SMATTERING
OF
CEMENT
DUST
AT
A
COSTBENEFIT
RATIO
OF
YOUD
BE
UP
IN
ARMS
WHY
IS
IT
OKAY
FOR
THE
JUDICIAL
BRANCH
TO
INTERFERE
THIS
WAY
BUT
NOT
THE
LEGISLATIVE
OR
EXECUTIVE
BRANCHES
ID
BE
UP
IN
ARMS
WHY
DO
YOU
ASSUME
THAT
QUITE
THE
CONTRARY
ID
PROBABLY
SUPPORT
THE
ACTION
SINCE
IT
WOULD
BE
BASED
ON
THE
SAME
GENERAL
DOCTRINE
AS
THE
DECISION
THAT
I
BELIEVE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CORRECT
IN
BOOMER
THE
IDEA
THAT
PEOPLES
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
VIOLATED
FOR
REASONS
OF
ECONOMIC
EFFICIENCY
IN
BOOMER
IT
WAS
BOOMERS
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
THE
COURT
SHOULD
HAVE
PROTECTED
IN
THE
HYPOTHETICAL
EPA
RULING
YOUVE
PRESENTED
ITS
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLES
COLLECTIVE
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
IN
A
HEALTHY
PHYSICAL
ENVIRONMENT
WHAT
GOOD
IS
COSTBENEFIT
RATIO
OF
IF
YOU
WIND
UP
WITH
CEMENT
DUST
IN
YOUR
AIR
YOUR
RULE
MAKES
IT
PER
SE
ILLEGAL
TO
EVER
OPERATE
A
CEMENT
PLANT
IF
THE
STATE
OF
MASSACHUSETTS
CAME
UP
WITH
A
SIMILAR
REGULATION
YOUD
BE
UP
IN
ARMS
AND
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
INTERFERENCE
WITH
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
AND
FIFTH
AMENDMENT
VIOLATIONS
ONCE
AGAINWHY
IS
IT
OKAY
FOR
THE
JUDICIAL
BRANCH
TO
INTERFERE
THIS
WAY
BUT
NOT
THE
LEGISLATIVE
OR
EXECUTIVE
BRANCHES
OR
ARE
YOU
NOT
THE
LIBERTARIAN
YOU
PRESENT
YOURSELF
AS
BEING
TED
FRANK
HOW
WOULD
IT
BE
PER
SE
ILLEGAL
TO
OPERATE
A
CEMENT
PLANT
WOULDNT
IT
JUST
MEAN
THAT
WHEN
BUYING
LAND
FOR
A
CEMENT
PLANT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
EITHER
BUY
ENOUGH
LAND
SO
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
POLLUTION
WOULD
STAY
ON
YOUR
LAND
OR
BUY
POLLUTION
EASEMENTS
FROM
THE
SURROUNDING
LANDOWNERS
TIM
SMITH
ALL
IT
TAKES
IS
ONE
HOLDOUT
OUT
OF
HUNDREDS
OF
NEIGHBORS
TO
SCRAP
THE
PLANT
FURTHERMORE
EACH
OF
THE
NEIGHBORS
IS
GOING
TO
WANT
THE
FULL
BENEFIT
OF
THE
BARGAIN
UNDER
THE
RESULTING
BILATERAL
MONOPOLY
A
BONANZA
FOR
LAWYERS
TO
BE
SURE
WHO
GET
TO
NEGOTIATE
EACH
OF
THESE
AGREEMENTS
A
WINDFALL
FOR
HOMEOWNERS
WHO
CAN
EXTORT
AWAY
ANY
PROFITS
THE
PLANT
WOULD
MAKE
BUT
NOT
PARTICULARLY
GOOD
FOR
SOCIETY
YES
SO
WHAT
THE
COURTS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
PROTECT
THE
SPECIFIC
RIGHTS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
NOT
THE
GENERAL
INTERESTS
OF
SOME
NEBULOUS
SOCIETY
IF
SOCIETY
CAN
HAVE
ITS
CEMENT
PLANT
WITHOUT
VIOLATING
ANYONES
RIGHTS
FINE
OTHERWISE
SOCIETY
WILL
SOMEHOW
HAVE
TO
LIMP
ALONG
WITH
ONE
LESS
CEMENT
PLANT
SEE
TED
I
REALLY
AM
A
LIBERTARIAN
AFTER
ALL
THATS
THE
WHOLE
POINT
BEHIND
THE
COASE
THEOREM
IN
A
WORLD
WITHOUT
TRANSACTIONS
COSTS
THE
LAND
WILL
AUTOMATICALLY
BE
PUT
TO
THE
BEST
USE
AS
IT
IS
TRANSFERRED
FROM
PERSON
TO
PERSON
INSTANTANEOUSLY
WITHOUT
FRICTION
THE
LEGAL
REGIME
WILL
NOT
MATTER
BECAUSE
THE
RESULT
WILL
BE
THE
SAME
IN
A
WORLD
SUCH
AS
OURS
ONE
WITH
TRANSACTIONS
COSTS
ONE
WANTS
THE
LEGAL
REGIME
TO
APPROXIMATE
THE
END
RESULT
TO
BEGIN
WITH
IN
ORDER
TO
MINIMIZE
THE

COSTS

WANTS
THE

TO
APPROXIMATE
THE

TO

WITH
IN

TO
MINIMIZE
THE

WHICH
ONE
ARE
YOU
SPEAKING
OF
I
WANT
THE
LEGAL
REGIME
TO
PROTECT
PEOPLES
RIGHTS
BESIDES
COASES
THEOREM
ONLY
HAS
REAL
APPLICATION
IN
THE
NEVERNEVER
LAND
OF
PERFECTLY
RATIONAL
ACTORS
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
STUBBORN
ORNERY
SPITEFUL
OR
OTHERWISE
IRRATIONAL
FROM
A
ECONOMIC
POINT
OF
VIEW
AND
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
COURTS
IS
TO
PROTECT
THEIR
RIGHT
TO
BE
SO
I
DONT
CARE
IF
YOU
CAN
SHOW
ME
LOGICALLY
THAT
YOUR
CATTLE
ARE
ONLY
DOING
OF
DAMAGE
TO
MY
PROPERTY
PER
HEAD
SO
I
SHOULD
RATIONALLY
SELL
YOU
GRAZING
RIGHTS
TO
MY
LAND
FOR
SAY
PER
HEAD
I
STILL
RETAIN
THE
RIGHT
TO
TELL
YOU
THAT
I
JUST
PLAIN
DONT
WANT
ANY
DAMNED
CATTLE
ON
MY
PROPERTY
NOT
AT
ANY
PRICE
AND
THEN
YOU
SAY
EVERYONES
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
WERE
PROTECTED
THE
PLAINTIFFS
WERE
MADE
WHOLE
UNNECESSARY
SETTLEMENT
COSTS
WERE
AVOIDED
AS
ABOVE
I
DISPUTE
YOUR
CLAIM
THAT
THE
PLAINTIFFS
WERE
MADE
WHOLE
THEY
WERE
IN
FACT
BY
COURT
ACTION
DEPRIVED
OF
THEIR
RIGHTS
AS
OWNERS
OF
PROPERTY
TO
CHOOSE
TO
SELL
OR
NOT
SELL
THAT
PROPERTY
AT
A
PRICE
ACCEPTABLE
TO
THEM
WDSTARR
THEN
BY
YOUR
ARGUMENT
NO
TORT
PLAINTIFF
IS
EVER
MADE
WHOLE
BECAUSE
THE
AWARD
OF
DAMAGES
IN
INVOLUNTARY
WHY
SHOULD
WE
TREAT
A
NUISANCE
PLAINTIFF
ANY
DIFFERENT
THAN
ANY
OTHER
TORT
PLAINTIFF
WE
DONT
REQUIRE
SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE
IN
THE
ANALOGOUS
CONTRACTUAL
SITUATION
WHY
IN
TORT
LAST
QUESTION
FIRST
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
AS
IN
CONTRACT
LAW
BECAUSE
TO
DO
SO
WOULD
COME
DANGEROUSLY
CLOSE
TO
TREADING
ON
THE
THIRTEENTH
AMENDMENT
AS
TO
YOUR
THEN
BY
YOUR
ARGUMENT
NO
TORT
PLAINTIFF
IS
EVER
MADE
WHOLE
BECAUSE
THE
AWARD
OF
DAMAGES
IN
INVOLUNTARY
CLAIM
YOURE
AT
LEAST
PARTIALLY
RIGHT
FACED
WITH
SITUATIONS
IN
WHICH
THE
WRONG
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
DONE
AND
THE
DAMAGE
TO
THE
VICTIM
HAS
ALREADY
TAKEN
PLACE
AND
CANNOT
BE
REVERSED
OR
UNDONE
COURTS
WILL
TRY
TO
SET
AN
EQUITABLE
PRICE
TAG
ON
THE
LOSS
SUFFERED
BY
THE
VICTIM
AND
REQUIRE
THE
WRONGDOER
TO
PAY
THIS
PRICE
RATHER
THAN
AN
INFLATED
PRICE
WHICH
THE
VICTIM
MIGHT
PREFER
IN
THESE
CASES
THE
SALE
HAS
ALREADY
TAKEN
PLACE
AND
IS
IRREVERSIBLE
AND
THE
COURT
SIMPLY
TRIES
TO
ENSURE
THAT
A
FAIR
PRICE
IS
PAID
UNDER
THE
DOCTRINES
THAT
A
ONLY
IN
CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
SHOULD
EVEN
A
CIVIL
WRONGDOER
BE
FORCED
TO
PAY
PUNITIVE
OR
EXCESSIVE
PRICES
AND
B
EVEN
A
GENUINE
VICTIM
SHOULD
NOT
PROFIT
IN
AN
UNJUSTIFIED
OR
INEQUITABLE
MANNER
FROM
HIS
VICTIMHOOD
BOTH
OF
THESE
DOCTRINES
MAY
BE
WORTH
DISCUSSING
OR
DEBATING
ELSEWHERE
BUT
NEITHER
IS
RELEVANT
TO
CASES
LIKE
BOOMER
IN
WHICH
THE
WRONGFUL
ACT
AND
THE
LOSS
STEMMING
FROM
IT
ARE
STILL
IN
THE
FUTURE
AND
CAN
BE
REVERSEDUNDONE
IE
PREVENTED
FROM
HAPPENING
AT
ALL
BY
ORDER
OF
THE
COURT
IN
THESE
TYPES
OF
CASES
ALL
THE
COURT
HAS
TO
DO
IS
REQUIRE
THAT
THE
POTENTIAL
VICTIMS
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
UNTIL
AND
UNLESS
HE
AGREES
TO
SELL
THEM
AT
A
MUTUALLYACCEPTABLE
PRICE
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
FOR
THE
COURT
TO
GUESS
AT
THE
EQUITABLE
VALUE
OF
THE
LOSS
AND
FORCE
BOTH
SIDES
TO
ACCEPT
ITS
FINDING
IT
CAN
LEAVE
THAT
OPERATION
UP
TO
THE
PARTIES
THEMSELVES
AND
AGAIN
I
ASK
SINCE
WHEN
ARE
THE
COURTS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
ENSURING
THAT
UNNECESSARY
SETTLEMENT
COSTS
ARE
AVOIDED
IF
SO
IVE
BEEN
MISEDUCATED
I
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
COURTS
WERE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
ENSURING
THAT
JUSTICE
IS
DONE
UNNECESSARY
SETTLEMENT
COSTS
ARE
UNJUST
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
PUNITIVE
IN
CASES
LIKE
BOOMER
THEYRE
SIMPLY
A
COST
OF
DOING
BUSINESS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PROPRIETORS
OF
THE
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
CO
GOT
THEMSELVES
INTO
A
POSITION
IN
WHICH
THEY
FOUND
THEMSELVES
OVER
THIS
BARREL
IS
SIMPLY
A
RESULT
OF
THEIR
OWN
POOR
BUSINESS
DECISION
TO
START
UP
A
CEMENT
PLANT
WITHOUT
FIRST
TRYING
TO
NEGOTIATE
WITH
BOOMER
AND
EVERYONE
ELSE
WHOSE
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
THEYD
BE
VIOLATING
VIA
THE
OPERATION
OF
THEIR
PLANT
THERES
NOTHING
PUNITIVE
OR
UNJUST
ABOUT
IT
IT
IS
COMPLETELY
SENSIBLE
ONLY
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ALLEGED
RIGHT
OF
THE
OWNERS
OF
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
TO
STAY
IN
BUSINESS
AND
AVOID
LOSING
A
LOT
OF
THEIR
OWN
MONEY
DUE
TO
THEIR
OWN
WRONGFUL
ACT
AND
THE
ALLEGED
RIGHT
OF
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
EMPLOYEES
TO
NOT
HAVE
THEIR
JOBS
DISAPPEAR
SHOULD
TRUMP
THE
RIGHTS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
OWN
PROPERTY
WHICH
WAS
DAMAGED
BY
ATLANTIC
CEMENTS
WRONGFUL
ACTS
WDSTARR
ANYBODY
WHO
EVER
COMMITS
A
WRONGFUL
ACT
SHOULD
DISGORGE
THEIR
ENTIRE
SET
OF
POSSESSIONS
TO

PERSON
WERENT
YOU
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
EXCESS
PUNITIVE
DAMAGES
BEFORE
ANYBODY
WHO
WANTS
TO
COMMIT
A
WRONGFUL
ACT
IN
THE
FUTURE
SHOULD
BE
REQUIRED
TO
BUY
THE
RIGHT
TO
DO
SO
FROM
THE
VICTIM
IN
ADVANCE
AND
THE
SELLER
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
SET
HIS
OR
HER
PRICE
FOR
THE
PRIVILEGE
NO
INJUSTICE
NO
PUNITIVE
DAMAGES
YOUD
LIKE
POSNER

HES
A
LIBERTARIAN
REALLY
I
DIDNT
KNOW
THAT
WHAT
IF
ANYTHING
HAS
HE
HAD
TO
SAY
ABOUT
CASES
LIKE

WDSTARR
IN

HE
CITES
IT
AS
AN

ITS

ON

PRESUMABLY
FAVORABLY
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
THAT

IN

OF

DOESNT
SOUND
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
A
LIBERTARIAN
TO
ME
LIBERTARIANS
TEND
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
RIGHTS
OF
INDIVIDUAL
PEOPLE
NOT
SOCIETIES
IVE
ADMITTED
THAT
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
FIELD
GENERALLY
REFERRED
TO
AS
LAW
AND
ECONOMICS
IS
WEAK
IF
IT
ADVOCATES
THE
USE
OF
ECONOMICAL
ANALYSIS
AS
ONE
OF
MANY
TIEBREAKER
FACTORS
WHICH
COURTS
MAY
USE
TO

THEM
REACH
DECISIONS
IN
CASES
IN
WHICH
THE
DISPUTE
AS
MEASURED
BY
THE
SCALE
OF
JUSTICE
IS
EVENLY
BALANCED
FINE
BUT
AS
ILLUSTRATED
BY
BOOMER
IT
IS
NOT
FINE
WHEN
THE
COURTS
START
VIEWING
THE
ECONOMICS
OF
A
CASE
AS
BEING
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
THE
JUSTICE
OF
A
CASE
WDSTARR
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
JUSTICE
OF

WAS
INTRICATELY
TIED
UP
WITH
THE

ATLANTIC

A

CAUSING

SHOULD
IT
PAY
IN

MILLIONS
OR
JUST
COMPENSATE
FOR
THE
DAMAGE
IT
COMMITTED
AS
STATED
ABOVE
THE

WAS
ONGOING
ATLANTIC
CEMENT
WANTED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
CONTINUE
TO
VIOLATE

RIGHTS
WHILE
THE

MAY
HAVE
BEEN
JUSTIFIED
IN
SETTING
AN
EQUITABLE
PRICE
TAG
ON
THE

ALREADY
COMMITTED
IT
HAD
NO
REASON
AND
NO

TO
SET
A

ON
THE
