THE
BATF
SHOULD
HAVE
LEFT
AT
THE
BEGINNING
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
KORESHS
PERSONALITY
INSTEAD
THEY
THOUGHT
THEY
HAVE
GUNS
WE
HAVE
BIGGER
GUNS
LETS
GO
GET
EM
THEY
BOTCHED
IT
FROM
DAY
ONE
THEY
SHOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
THERE
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THE
ABOVE
CONVENIENTLY
IGNORES
THE
MURDER
OF
FOUR
BATF
AGENTS
BY
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
IN
AN
UNPROVOKED
AMBUSH
AS
YOURE
NO
DOUBT
AWARE
PHILL
THERE
ARE
PROBABLY
FIVE
OR
SIX
DIFFERENT
MUTUALLY
CONTRADICTORY
VERSIONS
OF
THE
EVENTS
IN
WACO
ON
FEB
ALL
OF
WHICH
ARE
FROM
REPUTABLE
NEWS
SOURCES
RANGING
THE
THE
ASSOCIATED
PRESS
TO
TIME
TO
NEWSWEEK
SOME
OF
THE
EARLIEST
REPORTS
ISSUED
BY
THE
AP
WERE
NOT
AT
ALL
FLATTERING
THE
TO
BATF
AND
PRODUCED
SOME
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHO
FIRED
FIRST
NOW
FOR
ALL
I
KNOW
YOU
WERE
THERE
TO
WITNESS
IT
BUT
I
KIND
OF
DOUBT
THAT
ANY
GOVERNMENT
THAT
ALLOWS
TINPOT
DICTATORS
TO
SET
UP
SHOP
AND
DECLARE
A
PRIVATE
STATE
HAS
DRIFTED
INTO
ANARCHY
THERE
ARE
LAWS
TO
CONTROL
THE
OWNERSHIP
OF
GUNS
AND
THE
BATF
HAD
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELEIVE
THAT
THEY
WERE
BEING
VIOLATED
THEY
SET
OUT
TO
OBTAIN
A
LEGAL
WARRANT
AND
ATTEMPTED
TO
SERVE
IT
ONLY
TO
BE
MET
WITH
GUNFIRE
WHEN
THEY
RANG
THE
DOORBELL
THE
BATF
IN
A
LETTER
THEYVE
BEEN
SENDING
OUT
TO
PEOPLE
SAYS
BOTH
THAT
THEY
WERE
AMBUSHED
BECAUSE
THEY
LOST
THE
ELEMENT
OF
SURPRISE
AND
THAT
THEY
WENT
UP
AND
KNOCKED
ON
THE
DOOR
AND
HAD
IT
SLAMMED
IN
THEIR
FACES
IT
STRIKES
ME
AS
KIND
OF
STRANGE
TO
RELY
ON
SURPRISE
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
BY
KNOCKING
ON
THE
DOOR
THERE
ARE
AT
LEAST
QUESTIONS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
ANSWERED
THE
PARANOID
ASSERTION
THAT
THE
BATF
FIRED
FIRST
IN
AN
UNPROVOKED
ASSAULT
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
BATF
WERE
ON
A
DEATH
WISH
THIS
PARANOID
ASSERTATION
WAS
MADE
BY
WITNESSES
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
ASSAULT
WHO
STATED
THAT
THE
BATF
INITIATED
HOSTILITIES
BY
THROWING
CONCUSSION
GRENADES
AND
REPORTED
BY
THE
ASSOCIATED
PRESS
HAD
THEY
EXPECTED
THE
BD
TO
BE
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
PEACEFULL
CITIZENS
WHO
WOULD
ACCEPT
A
SEARCH
AUTHORIZED
BY
A
COURT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TURNED
UP
IN
A
TANK
AND
BROKEN
THE
DOOR
DOWN
ON
DAY
ONE
PHILL
THE
BATF
WERE
IN
A
FIREFIGHT
WITH
THE
BD
FOR
FORTYFIVE
MINUTES
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTING
PEACEFUL
CITIZENS
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
SHOWN
UP
IN
LIVESTOCK
TRAILERS
AND
WOULD
HAVE
RETREATED
IMMEDIATELY
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTING
PEACFUL
CITIZENS
WHY
SHOW
UP
WITH
OVER
A
HUNDRED
OFFICERS
SOME
OF
WHICH
CLEARLY
VISIBLE
ON
VIDEO
TO
BE
CARRYING
SUBMACHINEGUNS
AND
NATIONAL
GUARD
HELICOPTERS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHO
DID
WHAT
BUT
AS
I
SAID
THERE
ARE
QUESTIONS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
ANSWERED
