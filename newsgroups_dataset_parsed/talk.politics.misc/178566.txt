secondly
any
canadian
who
has
worked
and
participates
in
the
insurance
its
a
negative
option
you
have
to
explicitly
decline
it
knows
that
the
premium
is
deducted
separately
yes
and
some
americans
actually
have
a
problem
with
having
more
of
their
money
taken
from
them
to
pay
for
others
health
care
but
note
again
the
canadian
and
german
health
insurance
is
voluntary
not
true
i
am
required
to
have
insurance
by
law
the
method
of
collection
effectively
makes
it
a
tax
the
selfish
bastards
that
they
are
unfortunately
that
number
has
diminished
recently
but
once
president
pinocchio
gets
through
with
us
i
hope
for
a
reversal
of
trend
well
here
we
have
the
right
hoping
for
more
selfish
bastards
pity
they
dont
look
at
what
years
of
the
reganbush
selfish
bastard
ecconomy
has
done
to
the
country
elect
a
selfish
bastard
government
and
they
will
run
the
country
for
themselve
s
thats
why
they
are
selfish
bastards
bush
and
regan
gave
tax
breaks
for
the
ultra
rich
and
paid
for
them
by
borrowing
against
the
incomes
of
the
middle
class
this
country
is
hardly
ruined
in
fact
it
is
booming
compared
to
after
the
election
this
whole
usa
has
gone
to
hell
and
reaganbush
caused
it
is
not
only
lame
pathetic
and
old
its
wrong
under
reaganbush
the
economy
grew
by
trillion
dollars
this
is
more
than
the
entire
economy
of
germany
a
kind
gentle
country
in
many
peoples
books
what
a
joke
