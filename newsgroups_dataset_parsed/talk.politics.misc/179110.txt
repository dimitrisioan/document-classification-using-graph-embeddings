CAN
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
WHY
WHEN
MR
CRAMER
SPOUTS
ON
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALS
HE
ONLY
ADDRESSES
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
AND
NEVER
IN
ANY
POST
IVE
READ
ADDRESSED
LESBIANS
I
CANT
REALLY
SPEAK
FOR
MR
CRAMER
HERE
BUT
I
CAN
SAY
THAT
A
HOMOSEXUAL
MALE
IS
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
ANIMAL
THAN
A
LESBIAN
THERE
IS
VIRTUALLY
NOTHING
THAT
IS
ANALOGOUS
OR
RELATED
BETWEEN
THE
ABERRANT
BEHAVIORS
PRACTICED
BY
THESE
TWO
GROUPS
OF
DEVIANTS
SO
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
YOUR
MORALS
ITS
JUST
THAT
YOU
WOULDNT
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
WACK
OFF
TO
IF
YOU
DIDNT
HAVE
TAPES
OF
LESBIANS
GOING

I
THINK
WE
ARE
GETTING
CLOSER

TRUTH
NOW
NO
WE
ARE
GETTING

THIS
MAY
SURPRISE
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
DO
NOT
SPEND
THEIR
TIME
WATCHING
PORNOGRAPHY
AND
MASTURBATING
SOME
OF
US
HAVE
REAL
LIVES
INSTEAD
OF
SEXUAL
COMPULSIONS
BUT
I
DONT
EXPECT
A
HOMOSEXUAL
TO
UNDERSTAND
