re
getting
off
to
an
early
start
patrick
townson

writes
so
the
jury
will
be
making
its
announcement
at
am
saturday
morning
pacific
time
am
eastern
time
why
such
an
ungodly
hour
maybe
by
making
the
announcement
at
am
on
the
west
coast
they
figure
all
the
rioters
will
be
asleep
giving
the
troops
time
to
move
into
place
since
the
actual
verdicts
were
not
known
by
the
authorities
it
was
smart
not
to
allow
friday
night
for
fighting
sorry
elton
and
to
seal
them
for
this
morning
also
it
allows
for
maximum
daylight
to
wear
down
and
frustrate
any
potential
troublemakers
as
well
as
give
more
preparation
time
i
guess
we
can
look
forward
to
a
weekend
of
rioting
eh
are
you
a
local
news
intern
the
mayor
of
los
angeles
in
a
press
conference
about
am
saturday
morning
actually
that
was
pm
cos
it
was
shown
live
on
our
pm
news
and
cut
into
cnns
oclock
sports
sorry
but
i
didnt
watch
the
devilsislanders
game
no
sportschannel
meanwhile
following
the
announcement
of
the
jurys
verdict
the
judge
jury
and
assorted
court
personnel
will
be
evacuated
from
the
building
via
helicopters
landing
on
the
roof
of
the
courthouse
they
cant
even
walk
out
through
the
front
door
with
their
heads
held
high
we
had
cutovers
to
las
knbc
on
our
wnbc
and
i
didnt
recall
this
detail
but
ill
not
comment
further
on
that
wont
the
rioters
have
a
surprise
waiting
for
them
when
they
wake
up
later
today
a
netcontact
in
la
tells
me
that
the
alert
will
remain
over
this
weekend
as
some
elements
may
find
excuse
over
the
notguilty
verdicts
on
three
of
five
charges
the
aidingandabetting
those
acquittals
seem
to
balance
out
the
fact
that
rodney
king
himself
was
not
any
kind
of
angel
that
night
speeding
and
fleeing
et
al
however
another
consideration
is
any
street
celebrations
over
the
two
convictions
on
the
excessive
force
charges
koons
for
incompetance
and
powell
for
overreacting
both
guilty
as
heck
even
from
the
view
of
nypd
cops
interviewed
that
might
get
out
of
hand
also
some
elements
may
take
the
acquittals
as
an
excuse
to
challenge
the
cops
a
dumb
move
obviously
and
koreans
are
still
scared
and
certain
people
are
really
mad
over
how
they
have
armed
themselves
in
the
last
year
a
commander
from
nassau
long
island
was
questioned
about
how
his
people
would
have
handled
rodney
king
and
he
said
wed
have
let
him
roll
around
in
the
dirt
til
he
got
tired
then
handcuff
him
