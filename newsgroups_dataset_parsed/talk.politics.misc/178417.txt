HALLAMBAKER
WRITES
OR
ARE
THEY
SIMPLY
PROPOGRANDA
WE
CANT
KNOW
WHAT
PHILL
REALLY
MEANS
BECAUSE
HES
OBVIOUSLY
USING
ARGUMENTS
DESIGNED
TO
CONVINCE
I
MAKE
NO
SECRET
OF
WHAT
I
AM
UP
TO
I
HAVE
STATED
EXPLICITLY
IN
POSTS
THAT
I
AM
A
POLITICAL
PROPAGANDIST
ON
NUMEROUS
OCCASIONS
ANYONE
POSTING
TO
THIS
GROUP
WHO
IS
NOT
PROBABLY
HAS
THE
WRONG
GROUP
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
HAVE
ON
NUMEROUS
OCCASIONS
STATED
QUITE
CLEARLY
THAT
I
BELEIVE
THAT
CERTAIN
FACTIONS
OF
THE
GUN
LOBBY
ARE
THE
WORST
POSSIBLE
ADVOCATES
OF
THEIR
CAUSE
AND
I
AM
PREPARED
TO
DO
ANYTHING
IN
MY
POWER
TO
PROVIDE
THEM
WITH
A
PLATFORM
BECAUSE
THEY
CAN
CONVINCE
PEOPLE
FAR
BETTER
THAN
I
COULD
HOPE
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WITH
A
FIXATION
ON
LETHAL
WEAPONS
ARE
DANGEROUS
AND
DERRANGED
IF
YOU
HAPPEN
TO
KNOW
A
POLITICAL
POSITION
WHICH
DOES
NOT
HAVE
PEOPLE
ADVOCATING
IT
WHO
DO
MORE
HARM
THAN
GOOD
PLEASE
POINT
IT
OUT
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
EVEN
ACCUSED
ME
OF
INVENTING
SUCH
ADVOCATES
PURELY
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
HAVING
THEM
TRASH
A
SET
OF
POLITICAL
VIEWS
IN
FACT
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
FUTILE
TACTIC
BECAUSE
I
COULD
NEVER
HOPE
TO
INVENT
A
CHARACTER
AS
DANGEROUS
AS
SYBOKATHENAEDU
A
MAN
WHO
I
QUITE
SERIOUSLY
BELIEVE
TO
BE
MENTALY
ILL
AND
A
POTENTIAL
PSYCHOPATH
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
LOCAL
SHERIFS
OFFICE
HAVE
INFORMED
ME
THAT
THEY
ARE
UNABLE
TO
ACT
UNTILL
HE
ATTACKS
SOMEONE
ONE
OF
THE
ADVANTAGES
AND
DRAWBACKS
OF
REQUIRING
PROOF
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
BEFORE
THEY
MAY
TAKE
ACTION
AGAINST
CITIZENS
AND
PART
OF
THE
REASON
SOME
OF
US
BELIEVE
WEAPONS
SHOULD
BE
AVAILABLE
SO
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
ASK
ME
WHAT
IS
THE
POINT
THAT
I
AM
TRYING
TO
MAKE
FROM
THIS
CURRENT
ARGUMENT
ON
THE
ABSOLUTE
SANCTITY
OF
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
WHAT
WOULD
I
ANSWER
WE
ARE
NOT
ARGUING
THE
ABSOLUTE
SANCTITY
OF
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
IN
FACT
THE
FILLIBUSTER
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
ISNT
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
I
OBJECTED
TO
YOUR
SUGGESTION
THAT
THE
SENATE
WASNT
INTENDED
TO
EXERCISE
THE
POWER
IT
WAS
CLEARLY
GIVEN
FIRSTLY
I
SEE
THAT
THE
CURRENT
US
POLITICAL
SCENE
LIKE
THE
UK
POLITICAL
SCENE
HAS
BECOME
TIED
TO
SPECIAL
INTERESTS
RATHER
THAN
CHASE
THE
CONVENIENT
CARICATURES
PUT
ABOUT
BY
THE
MEDIA
AND
POLITITIANS
THEMSELVES
FOR
THIS
GAY
RIGHTS
CMAPAIGNERS
ENVIRONMENTALISTS
ZIONISTS
IE
JEWS
FOREIGN
LOBBYISTS
WHATEVER
VOTING
POWER
THEY
HAVE
ETC
I
SUGEST
THAT
YOU
LOOK
AT
WHO
IS
REALLY
BENEFITING
THE
INEVITABLE
CONCLUSION
IS
THAT
IT
IS
THE
MAJOR
CORPORATIONS
OWNED
BY
THE
ULTRAWEALTHY
THAT
HAVE
BENEFITED
REGAN
AND
BUSH
CREATED
WHAT
CAN
ONLY
BE
DESCRIBED
AS
A
WELFARE
STATE
FOR
THE
RICH
ILL
POINT
OUT
AGAIN
THAT
REAGAN
ONLY
HAD
A
REPUBLICAN
MAJORITY
IN
THE
SENATE
DURING
HIS
FIRST
TERM
AND
HIS
COALITION
IN
THE
HOUSE
CAME
APART
AT
ABOUT
THE
SAME
TIME
BUSH
NEVER
HAD
ANY
REAL
SUPPORT
IN
CONGRESS
THE
REAL
POINT
IS
THAT
EVERYBODY
EVERYWHERE
GOT
THEIR
PORK
FROM
THE
BIG
CORPORATIONS
TO
THE
GUY
I
SAW
LAST
NIGHT
LEAVING
A
CONVENIENCE
STORE
WITH
AN
ARMFUL
OF
JUNKFOOD
HED
BOUGHT
WITH
FOOD
STAMPS
HE
SPENT
MORE
IN
FOOD
STAMPS
ON
JUNK
THAN
I
MAKE
IN
A
WEEK
AND
IM
NOT
ON
GOVERNMENT
ASSITANCE
MONEY
WAS
DIVERTED
FROM
PROGRAMS
ADDRESSING
SOCIAL
NEEDS
AND
POURED
INTO
THE
WEAPONS
INDUSTRY
IN
THE
FORM
OF
COST
PLUS
PROFITS
CONTRACTS
LESSEE
LETS
PULL
OUT
THE
OLD
ALMANAC
IN
TOTAL
US
GOVERNMENT
BUDGET
OUTLAYS
WERE
BILLION
DOLLARS
IN
EST
THEY
WERE
TRILLION
DOLLARS
AN
INCREASE
OF
APPROX
BILLION
DOLLARS
IN
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
COST
BILLION
DOLLARS
IN
IT
WAS
BILLION
DOLLARS
AND
INCREASE
OF
BILLION
DOLLARS
THAT
LEAVES
AN
INCREASE
OF
BILLION
DOLLARS
UNACCOUNTED
FOR
THIS
REPRESENTED
AN
INCREASE
OF
IN
INCOME
SECURITY
WHICH
INCLUDES
RETIREMENT
PROGRAMS
HOUSING
ASSITANCE
AND
UNEMPLOYMENT
BENEFITS
AND
I
BELIEVE
WELFARE
COST
BILLION
DOLLARS
IN
IT
WAS
BILLION
DOLLARS
OR
MORE
THAN
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
STARTED
THIS
REPRESENTED
AN
INCREASE
OF
IN
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
SPENT
BILLION
DOLLARS
ON
MEDICARE
IN
THEY
SPENT
BILLION
DOLLARS
AN
INCREASE
OF
IN
THE
FEDS
SPENT
BILLION
DOLLARS
ON
HOUSING
CREDITS
AND
SUBSIDIES
OF
THAT
LIKE
IN
IT
WAS

UP

TO

TRASNPORTATION
UP

TO

ABOUT
THE
ONLY
THINGS
I
SEE
WHICH
WAS
SERIOUSLY
DECREASED
WAS
UNDER
THE
ENERGY
CATEGORY
PRIMARILY
UNDER
SUPPLY
AND
COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT
IN
THE
AREA
OF
DISASTER
RELIEF
AND
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
OF
THEM
REPRESENT
A
LOSS
OF
LESS
THAN
BILLION
DOLLARS
WHERE
WAS
THIS
HUGE
DIVERSION
IN
ORDER
TO
RECTIFY
THIS
SITUATION
THERE
MUST
BE
CONSTITUTIONAL
REVISION
NOT
THATS
A
STRETCH
IF
THE
CURRENT
GOVERNMENT
WAS
PUSHED
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
TO
CREATE
THIS
MESS
WOULDNT
ONE
EXPECT
IT
TO
BEGIN
TO
EQUALIZE
ONCE
THE
PRESSURE
IS
GONE
SECONDLY
THE
FORM
OF
THIS
REVISION
MUST
TAKE
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
CHANGED
CIRCUMSATNCES
OF
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
ONLY
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
NEW
ROLE
IS
A
POSITIVE
ROLE
WE
WANT
TO
CONTINUE
I
SEE
VERY
LITTLE
POSITIVE
ABOUT
IT
THE
CONSTITUTION
CANNOT
BE
USED
TO
FRUSTRATE
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
THE
CONSTITUTION
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
FRUSTRATE
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
SO
THAT
THE
VOTERS
COULD
BE
ABSOLUTELY
SURE
THEY
WERE
GETTING
WHAT
THEY
WANTED
BY
THE
TIME
IT
HAPPENED
NOR
DO
I
SEE
PUTTING
THE
BRAKES
ON
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
AN
INHERENTLY
BAD
THING
CALIFRONIAS
RIDING
THE
EDGE
AND
EVERY
TIME
THEY
PULL
THEIR
BALLOT
INITIATIVE
NONSENSE
IT
GETS
WORSE
IF
THE
PEOPLR
WANT
TO
HAVE
WELFARE
SPENDING
BY
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
IT
SOMETIMES
OR
PERHAPS
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THE
PEOPLE
SHOULD
BE
TOLD
NO
AND
POINTED
TO
THEIR
LOCAL
GOVERNMENT
ATTEMPTING
TO
PREVENT
THIS
THROUGH
CONSTITUTIONAL
TRICKERY
ONLY
LEADS
TO
THE
CONSTITUTION
BEING
BROUGHT
INTO
DISREPUTE
PHILL
WOULD
YOU
DO
ME
THE
VERY
GREAT
FAVOR
OF
REPEATING
THAT
IN
TALKPOLITICSGUNS
METHODS
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
FOUND
TO
BYPASS
SUCH
PROVISIONS
AND
ONCE
THE
GOVERNMENT
GETS
USED
TO
BYPASSING
THOSE
PROVISIONS
THEY
WILL
BYPASS
THE
OTHERS
UP
TO
THE
FIRST
AMMENDMENT
CUTE
WE
CAN
ELIMINATE
VIOLATIONS
OF
THE
LAW
BY
ELIMINATING
THE
LAW
THIS
IS
A
MAJOR
REASON
WHY
THE
RIGHT
TO
OWN
GUNS
SHOULD
BE
EXCLUDED
THE
IMPLICATION
THAT
THIS
RIGHT
IS
EQUAL
TO
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREE
SPEECH
IS
DANGEROUS
FREE
SPEECH
ALONE
IS
DANGEROUS
PHILL
PEOPLE
KNOW
THAT
MASS
OWNERSHIP
OF
LETHAL
WEAPONS
CAUSES
THOUSANDS
OF
MURDERS
A
YEAR
THE
DANGEROUS
CONCLUSION
THEY
MAY
REACH
IS
THAT
THE
FIRST
AMMENDMENT
MAY
ALSO
BE
THE
SAME
DANGEROUS
MISTAKE
OK
PHILL
ALL
YOU
GOTTA
SHOW
ME
IS
A
CLEAR
PATTERN
OF
REDUCTION
IN
HOMICIDE
RATES
ACROSS
SEVERAL
COUNTRIES
AND
THATLL
BE
IT
NOT
CURRENT
MIND
YOU
REDUCTION
NOTE
HOWEVER
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SLIPPERY
SLOPE
ARGUMENT
IT
IS
BECAUSE
THE
RIGHT
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
HAS
BEEN
CHAINED
TO
THE
PRIVILEGE
TO
OWN
WEAPONRY
THAT
THE
DANGER
ARISES
THE
ADVOCATES
OF
THIS
PIVILEGE
MUST
NOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
CHAIN
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
TO
THEIR
CAUSE
SUCH
THAT
IF
THEY
FALL
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
FALLS
AS
WELL
SUCH
ACTIONS
ARE
NOT
THE
ACTIONS
OF
PEOPLE
GENUINELY
INTERESTED
IN
FREEDOM
WHOS
CHAINING
ANYTHING
TO
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
BY
CALLING
IT
A
FREEDOM
THIRDLY
AND
MOST
IMPORTANTLY
I
WANT
TO
DISCOVER
A
MECHANISM
WHERBY
I
CAN
ENGENDER
INTELLECTUAL
DEBATE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
TOTEMIC
DEBATE
I
CONSIDER
THE
GRAVE
THREAT
TO
CIVILISATION
TO
BE
THE
LOSS
OF
THE
ABILITY
TO
REASON
ABOUT
THE
POLITICAL
DEBATE
AT
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
THE
SUPERFICIAL
LEVEL
THE
OBJECTION
I
RAISE
TO
YOUR
BASING
YOUR
CASE
ENTIRELY
ON
THE
ASSERTION
OF
THE
SUPREMACY
OF
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
IS
THAT
THE
CURRENCY
OF
YOUR
ARGUMENT
IS
LIMITED
TO
THE
CURRENCY
OF
THE
TOTEM
UPON
WHICH
IT
IS
BASED
THE
DANGER
OF
TOTEMS
IS
THAT
THEY
CAN
BE
REINTERPRETED
IN
DIFFERENT
WAYS
BY
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
PHILL
YOURE
A
MASTER
OF
SUBTLY
CHANGING
THE
SUBJECT
I
HAVENT
BASED
MY
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
RAW
DEMOCRACY
ON
THE
CONSTITUTION
IVE
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
IT
ISNT
A
GOOD
IDEA
THE
ONLY
TIME
IVE
REFERRED
TO
THE
CONSTITUTION
IS
TO
POINT
OUT
IT
DOESNT
CONTAIN
THE
RESTRICTIONS
ON
THE
VETO
AND
THE
SENATE
YOU
APPEAR
TO
BELIEVE
WERE
MEANT
BUT
JUST
DIDNT
MAKE
IT
IN
THERE
THE
CONSTITUTION
DOESNT
CONTAIN
THE
FILLIBUSTER
RULE
I
ONLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
RULE
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
YOU
CNT
DISMISS
THAT
AS
VENERATING

BECAUSE
IT
ISNT
