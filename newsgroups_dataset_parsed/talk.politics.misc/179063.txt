RE
CLAYTON
IS
AN
ASSHOLE
BUT
WE
ALL
ALREADY
KNOW
THAT
HERES
A
HYPOTHETICAL
QUESTION
IF
CLAYTON
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
ALL
THOSE
NIGGERS
ARE
REALLY
STUPID
PLEASE
DONT
BE
OFFENDED
IM
NOT
RACIST
BUT
MERELY
USING
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
CLAYTONS
MALIGN
LOGIC
AND
THEN
SAID
HE
READ
A
REPORT
THAT
A
LOT
OF
BLACKS
IN
INNER
CITIES
DROPPED
OUT
OF
SCHOOL
I
BET
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
YOUR
SUPPORT
YET
HE
CAN
CLAIM
THAT
ALL
HOMOSEXUALS
ARE
DISHONEST
EVIL
LYING
CHILD
MOLESTERS
WITHOUT
PERSONALLY
HAVING
A
SINGLE
HOMOSEXUAL
FRIEND
OR
ACQUAINTANCE
AND
YOULL
SIT
THERE
AND
SUPPORT
HIM
GOD
CREATED
A
PLACE
FOR
BIGOTS
ITS
CALLED
HELL
AND
CLAYTON
IS
GOING
TO
BURN
THERE
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
I
PRAY
FOR
HIM
TO
FIND
IN
HIS
HEART
THE
CHRISTIAN
VALUES
HE
ESPOUSES
SO
THAT
HE
CAN
LEARN
TO
LOVE
HIS
GAY
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
BECAUSE
ANYONE
WITH
SO
MUCH
HATRED
IN
HIS
SOUL
COULLD
NEVER
BE
RIGHTEOUS
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
SUPPORTING
CLAYTONS
OPINIONS
AND
SUPPORTING
HIS
RIGHT
TO
SPEAK
I
WANT
YOU
TO
KNOW
THAT
YOU
CANNOT
EDUCATE
ANDOR
ELEVATE
ONES
UNDERSTANDING
BY
CALLING
HIM
NAMES
CLAYTON
HAS
AN
OPINION
WHICH
IN
HIS
MIND
IS
AS
VALID
AS
ANY
OPINION
ANYONE
ELSE
ON
THE
NET
HAS
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
WALK
UP
TO
BLACK
PERSON
TO
TALK
ABOUT
BLACKS
IN
THE
INNER
CITY
AND
BEGAN
THE
CONVERSATION
WITH
THOSE
NIGGERS
IN
TH
YOU
WOULD
LOSE
THE
ATTENTION
OF
THAT
BLACK
PERSON
BY
THE
TIME
YOU
SPOKE
YOUR
SECOND
WORD
ALL
NAME
CALLING
AND
DERISIVE
REMARKS
DO
IS
TURN
OFF
THE
AUDIENCE
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
ADDRESS
CLAYTON
IS
GUILTY
OF
THAT
AND
AS
SUCH
HAS
DISTRACTED
ATTENTION
AWAY
FROM
HIS
MESSAGE
TO
BITS
AND
PIECES
OF
HIS
CONVERSATION
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
REPEAT
HIS
MISTAKES
