EIGHT
MYTHS
ABOUT
NATIONAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
PT

AN
OFFICE
VISIT
THATS
IN
SEATTLE
IS
IN
VANCOUVER
CANADA
THATS
BECAUSE
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
THEYVE
GIVEN
THEIR
GOVERNMENT
POWER
TO
BARGAIN
WITH
DOCTORS
AND
HOSPITALS
OVER
FEES
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
LITIGATION
ENVIRONMENT
IS
REFLECTED
IN
THE
FEES
LACK
OF
DEFENSIVE
MEDICINE
AND
NEARABSENCE
OF
MALPRACTICE
IS
REALLY
WHY
WE
SPEND
LESS
USING
THE
MOST
EXPENSIVE
APPROACH
OF
PURE
INSURANCE
IN
CANADA
ALONG
WITH
FRANCE
AND
GERMANY
WITHOUT
HMOS
THE
NYT
HAS
ADMITTED
THAT
MALPRACTICE
INSURANCE
FEES
ARE
AN
ORDER
OF
MAGNITUDE
LOWER
IN
CANADA
BUT
DOCTORS
TAKEHOME
PAY
IS
ALMOST
EQUAL
TO
AMERICAN
DOCTORS
ALSO
MINIMAL
BUREAUCRACY
COS
THE
SYSTEM
IS
SOOO
SIMPLE
EARLY
MARCH
PART
OF
THE
DEAL
FOR
USING
THE
ALLINSURANCE
APPROACH
LIKE
THE
FRENCH
AND
GERMANS
DO
HEY
WHY
DONT
THEY
CRITICIZE
FRANCE
AND
GERMANY
IS
IT
BECAUSE
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
TAKE
FRENCH
AND
GERMAN
IN
COLLEGE
TO
MAKE
THE
ACCUSATIONS
STICK
WAS
TO
PRESERVE
THE
DOCTORS
INDEPENDANCE
SINCE
THE
PROVINCIAL
WINGS
OF
THE
CMA
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
GO
TO
BAT
WHEN
THE
FEE
SCHEDULE
HIKES
ARE
PRESENTED
THE
POLITICALLYBENT
DOCTORS
WERE
JUST
CACKLING
WHEN
THEY
REALIZED
THE
CMA
WOULD
GROW
IN
STRENGTH
RATHER
THAN
DIMINISH
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
UNOPPOSED
UNLIKE
IN
SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE
APPROACHES
LIKE
BRITAINS
NATIONAL
HEALTH
SERVICE
YOUVE
GOT
TO
REMEMBER
YOUVE
GOT
A
WAITING
LIST
AS
WELL
BUT
ITS
NOT
AS
OBVIOUS
IF
YOURE
POOR
AND
YOU
DONT
HAVE
INSURANCE
YOU
DONT
GO
TO
A
SURGEON
IN
THE
STATES
YOU
RATION
BY
ABILITY
TO
PAY
FOR
NONLIFE
THREATENING
THINGS
MARKET
ARGUMENTS
ADEQUATELY
COVER
WHY
CERTAIN
PROCEDURES
ARE
IN
SCARCER
DEMAND
I
HAVE
MD
FRIENDS
WHO
CANT
MAKE
A
LIVING
AS
SPECIALISTS
BACK
IN
MANITOBA
NOT
DUE
TO
THE
INSURANCE
RATES
BUT
BECAUSE
THEY
WONT
GET
ENOUGH
CUSTOMERS
THE
CMA
MEDICAL
MONOPOLYS
GRIP
ON
DOCTORS
LICENCING
AS
IN
THE
US
ASIDE
SO
THEY
MUST
MOVE
TO
LARGER
PLACES
HOWEVER
THIS
DOES
NOT
REFUTE
DEBUNKING
OF
WAITING
LINES
FOR
URGENT
AND
ROUTINE
CARE
AS
HAS
BEEN
DONE
IN
THE
US
BY
CONSUMERS
REPORTS
HEALTH
POLICY
STUDIES
CITED
BY
PROF
DENNIS
E
SHEA
ON
USENET
CNN
NYT
ETC
DOUG
FIERRO
HAS
POSTED
A
NYT
ARTICLE
FROM
WEEKS
AGO
ABOUT
CANADAS
HEALTH
INSURANCE
APPROACH
ON
TALKPOLITICSMEDICINE
THERE
IS
ONE
SMALL
ERROR
IN
THE
ARTICLE
NOT
ALL
OF
OUR
HOSPITALS
ARE
PRIVATE
WOULDNT
NATIONAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
MEAN
THAT
AMERICANS
WHO
ARE
NOW
FULLY
INSURED
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
SETTLE
FOR
LESS
IN
CANADA
PROVINCIAL
INSURANCE
COVERS
ALL
HEALTH
COSTS
EXCEPT
DENTAL
CARE
EYEGLASSES
PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS
AMBULANCE
SERVICE
AND
PRIVATE
HOSPITAL
ROOMS
SO
MANY
CANADIANS
DO
END
UP
BUYING
SOME
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
A
POLICY
TO
COVER
ALL
OF
THESE
THINGS
RUNS
ABOUT
TO
A
MONTH
OF
COURSE
THE
ONE
THING
TO
NOTE
IS
THAT
IN
THE
CANADAFRANCEGERMANY
CASE
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
OFFLOADED
THE
BASIC
COVERAGE
TO
THE
PUBLIC
SECTOR
THEY
REALIZED
THEY
WERE
KEEPING
LOWRISKHIGHPROFIT
EXTRA
INSURANCE
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
PRIVATESEMIPRIVATE
ROOMS
VS
WARD
ACCOMODATION
DENTAL
GLASSES
ETC
FOR
CORPORATE
OR
PERSONAL
BENEFITS
THEYLL
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
YOU
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
COVERED
FOR
BASIC
CARE
AT
THAT
POINT
THEY
WOULDNT
EVEN
CONSIDER
A
VOUCHER
APPROACH
TO
BROKER
THE
UNIVERSAL
COVERAGE
AND
SELL
POLICIES
TO
MAKE
UP
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
FEDERAL
GUIDELINES
AND
MARKET
STUFF
WOULDNT
FREE
CARE
ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE
TO
RUN
TO
THE
DOCTOR
FOR
EVERY
ACHE
AND
PAIN
PEOPLE
WHO
GET
FREE
TREATMENT
DO
GO
TO
THE
DOCTOR
AND
HOSPITAL
ABOUT
A
THIRD
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
TO
PAY
A
SHARE
OF
THEIR
MEDICAL
BILLS
STILL
CANADIANS
WHO
PAY
NOTHING
AT
THE
DOCTORS
HAVE
A
LOWER
PERPERSON
HEALTH
BILL
THAN
WE
DO
IT
IS
FREE
IN
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
DEDUCTIBLES
NOR
COPAYMENTS
TWO
THINGS
WHICH
I
ADVOCATE
TO
MAKE
THE
CANADIAN
INSURANCE
LOOK
MORE
LIKE
REAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
WHICH
ACTUALLY
IT
IS
I
KNOW
THAT
WHEN
WORKING
IN
ALBERTA
ONTARIO
AND
QUEBEC
I
WAS
AWARE
THAT
I
WAS
PAYING
FOR
HEALTH
INSURANCE
EG
IN
TORONTO
OHIP
FEES
WERE
LISTED
ON
MY
PAY
STUB
MANITOBA
DID
NOT
COLLECT
AT
PAYCHEQUE
TIME
BUT
ONLY
ANNUALLY
AT
INCOME
TAX
TIME
BUILT
INTO
THE
TAX
RATE
ONLY
FISCAL
NAIFS
WILL
PROCLAIM
THAT
ITS
FREE
ALONG
WITH
THE
CANADIAN
LEFT
FOR
THAT
IS
PART
OF
THEIR
BRAINWASHING
AGENDA
THE
FRENCH
DO
HAVE
COPAYMENTS
THOUGH
FRANCE
MAGAZINES
SUMMER
EDITION
HAS
A
FANTASTIC
PRESENTATION
OF
THEIR
BASIC
INSURANCE
COVERAGE
INCLUDING
A
SAMPLE
CHART
OF
COPAYMENT
PERCENTAGES
FOR
DAYS
YOURE
COVERED
FOR
OF
THE
PUBLIC
HOSPITAL
RATE
AFTERWARD
WITH
EXTRA
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
YOU
CAN
GET
INTO
A
PRIVATE
HOSPITAL
AND
BE
COVERED
FOR
ANY
DIFFERENCES
BEYOND
THE
PUBLIC
HOSPITAL
RATE
THE
PUBLIC
INSURANCE
COVERS
BEYOND
DAYS
OR
THE
SAME
CASH
AMOUNT
FOR
A
PRIVATE
HOSPITAL
AND
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
PAID
OUTOFPOCKET
OR
ACCORDING
TO
YOUR
SUPPLEMENTARY
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
OVER
OF
FRENCH
HAVE
SOME
FORM
OF
EXTRA
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
SO
THE
OTHER
OF
HEALTH
COSTS
IN
EUROPE
ARE
OUT
OF
PRIVATE
FUNDS
NOT
GLEANED
FROM
OTHER
TAXES
THE
GDP
FIGURES
ARE
COMBINED
PUBLIC
AND
PRIVATE
EXPENDITURES
FOR
TOTAL
OUTLAY
USING
THE
SAME
METHODS
THAT
YIELD
THE
FIGURE
FOR
THE
US
ISNT
THE
PRIVATE
HEALTH
INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
JUST
TOO
BIG
AND
POWERFUL
TO
KILL
DISMANTLING
THE
HEALTH
SEGMENT
OF
OUR
INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
WOULD
BE
POLITICALLY
THORNY
IN
THE
QUIET
WORDS
OF
ONE
ADVOCATE
FOR
A
NATIONAL
PLAN
SOME
FIRMS
NOW
SELL
MORE
THAN
BILLION
IN
HEALTH
INSURANCE
THEYD
PUT
UP
A
HARD
FIGHT
NOT
ONLY
HAS
THE
INDUSTRY
GROWN
EIGHTFOLD
SINCE
CANADA
SHUT
DOWN
ITS
OWN
HEALTH
INSURERS
BUT
OUR
GOVERNMENT
LEAVES
POLITICIANS
MORE
OPEN
TO
LOBBYISTS
THAN
DOES
CANADAS
PARLIAMENTARY
SYSTEM
HEALTH
INSURANCE
DOES
EXIST
IN
CANADA
AND
IN
WESTERN
EUROPE
ITS
JUST
THAT
IT
DOESNT
COVER
BASIC
CARE
YOU
CAN
OPT
OUT
IN
CANADA
AND
GERMANY
BUT
YOULL
HAVE
TO
GO
UNINSURED
AS
A
RESULT
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
TOO
FEW
OTHER
PEOPLE
THAT
DO
SO
IE
NO
MARKET
WHEN
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
REALIZED
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
THEYD
MAKE
WITHOUT
THE
RISKS
INVOLVED
IN
BASIC
INSURANCE
EG
NEUROSURGERY
VERSUS
DELUXE
AMENITIES
EG
HAVING
TO
CALL
GRANADA
TV
TO
REPLACE
A
RENTAL
SET
ON
THE
FRITZ
IN
SOMEONES
PRIVATE
HOSPITAL
ROOM
THEY
STARTED
TO
PAT
THEMSELVES
ON
THE
BACK
FOR
THEIR
SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
IN
QUEBEC
LAST
SPRING
A
