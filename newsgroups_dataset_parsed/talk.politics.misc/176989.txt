re

po

the
deficits
declined
from
reaching
a
low
of
of
gnp
before
the
tax
and
spending
hike
of
reversed
the
trend
brett
is
this
true
some
more
details
would
be
appreciated
cheers
actually
not
brett
himself
has
actually
posted
the
data
previously
what
declined
from
to
as
i
remember
it
was
percent
increaseindeficitgrowth
ie
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
deficit
derivative
of
total
deficit
with
respect
of
to
time
decreased
would
you
please
define
nth
derivative
of
debt
last
time
i
asked
you
seem
to
have
disappeared
and
its
the
deficits
themselves
that
came
down
to
of
gnp
the
numbers
are
posted
in
the
previous
posting
brett
apparently
has
numbed
himself
into
thinking
that
the
deficit
declined
cute
paul
but
with
no
numbers
you
still
look
foolish
if
you
keep
spending
more
than
you
earn
the
deficit
keeps
growing
paul
like
many
others
is
confusing
the
deficit
with
the
debt
if
you
keep
borrowing
at
a
lesser
rate
than
you
borrowed
previously
the
deficit
increases
you
only
decrease
deficits
when
your
income
exceeds
spending
and
you
use
the
difference
to
pay
off
debts
not
in
terms
of
gnp
the
one
universally
accepted
measure
of
deficits
at
least
among
rigorous
economists
arguments
were
brilliant
he
confirmed
with
data
what
many
of
us
know
with
common
sense
the
boom
of
the
has
nothing
to
do
with
government
policy
particularly
supply
side
policy
since
taxes
do
not
cause
economic
activities
people
cause
economic
activity
more
can
be
semantics
lindsey
proves
otherwise
taxes
make
people
change
their
economic
activities
or
shall
we
debate
whether
it
is
the
gun
the
bullet
or
the
person
who
does
the
killing
explained
by
watching
population
waves
roll
through
the
years
and
create
cycles
he
has
made
models
and
predictions
for
years
well
into
the
middle
of
next
century
it
will
be
neat
to
see
how
accurate
he
is
or
whether
this
gentleman
can
win
the
same
praise
as
lindsey
brett
theres
nothing
so
passionate
as
a
vested
interest
disguised
as
an
intellectual
conviction
