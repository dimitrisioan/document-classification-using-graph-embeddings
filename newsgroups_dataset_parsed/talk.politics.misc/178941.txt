WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
TIM
SMITH
WRITES
WHAT
KIND
OF
WITNESSES
IF
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
WITNESSES
WHO
WERE
AT
THE
ACCIDENT
OR
WERE
OTHERWISE
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
EG
PARAMEDICS
EMERGENCY
ROOM
DOCTORS
ETC
THEN
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
USED
AT
THE
FIRST
TRIAL
YOU
DONT
GET
A
NEW
TRIAL
BECAUSE
YOU
SCREWED
UP
AND
FORGOT
TO
CALL
ALL
OF
YOUR
WITNESSES
THEY
ARE
TWO
WITNESSES
WHO
DIDNT
COME
FORTH
UNTIL
AFTER
THE
FIRST
TRIAL
WHILE
IT
WOULD
BE
TOUGH
LUCK
FOR
GM
IF
THEY
NEW
ABOUT
THESE
WITNESSES
BEFOREHAND
IMO
THIS
CONSTITUTES
NEW
EVIDENCE
THE
TEST
ISNT
WHETHER
GM
KNEWOTHERWISE
THAT
WOULD
REWARD
GM
FOR
ITS
STUPIDITY
THE
TEST
IS
WHETHER
GM
REASONABLY
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
OF
THEIR
EXISTENCE
IT
WORKS
BOTH
WAYSIF
GM
HAD
WON
THE
TRIAL
AND
THE
PLAINTIFF
TURNED
UP
TWO
WITNESSES
WHO
CAME
FORWARD
AFTER
THE
FIRST
TRIAL
WHO
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
LOCATED
BEFOREHAND
TOO
BAD
SO
SADNO
NEW
TRIAL
LIKE
TIM
SAID
YOU
DONT
GET
A
NEW
CIVIL
TRIAL
BECAUSE
YOU
SCREWED
UP
THE
FIRST
TIME
AROUND
UNLIKE
THE
CRIMINAL
JUSTICE
SYSTEM
REPOSE
IS
MUCH
MORE
IMPORTANT
IN
THE
CIVIL
JUSTICE
SYSTEM
