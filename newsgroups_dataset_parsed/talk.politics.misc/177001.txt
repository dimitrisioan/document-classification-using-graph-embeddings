GENE
W
SMITH
WRITES
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
PEOPLE
VOTED
FOR
HITLER
AND
HE
BECAME
REICH
CHANCELLOR
IN
GOOD
PART
BECAUSE
HE
USED
BULLY
BOYS
TO
ATTACK
COMMUNISTS
HITLER
DID
NOT
BECOME
BECOME
REICH
CHANCELLOR
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
VOTED
FOR
HIM
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
YOU
MEANT
TO
IMPLY
THAT
OR
NOT
BUT
I
JUST
THOUGHT
ID
BRING
THAT
UP
HITLER
BECAME
CHANCELLOR
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
VOTED
FOR
HIS
POLITICAL
PARTY
THATS
NOT
A
HUGE
DIFFERENCE
IN
A
PARLIAMENTARY
SYSTEM
YOUR
STATEMENT
IS
A
COMMON
MISCONCEPTION
BUT
IT
JUST
ISNT
TRUE
IN
THE
GERMAN
WEIMAR
SYSTEM
THE
CHANCELLOR
WAS
NOT
NECESSARILY
THE
LEADER
OF
THE
LARGEST
REICHSTAG
PARTY
THE
CHANCELLOR
WAS
APPOINTED
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
AND
GENERALLY
WAS
THE
LEADER
OF
A
COALITION
OF
PARTIES
WHO
COULD
FORM
AN
EFFECTIVE
MAJORITY
IN
THE
REICHSTAG
BEYOND
THAT
THE
IMPLICATION
THAT
HITLER
ROSE
TO
THE
CHANCELLORSHIP
BECAUSE
A
MAJORITY
OF
GERMANS
WANTED
NAZI
RULE
IS
FALSE
AS
WELL
BEFORE
PRESIDENT
HINDENBURG
APPOINTED
HITLER
CHANCELLOR
IN
JANUARY
THE
GERMAN
PEOPLE
DID
NOT
SHOW
A
PARTICULAR
DESIRE
TO
BE
LED
EITHER
BY
HITLER
OR
BY
THE
NAZI
PARTY
THESE
ARE
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
MARCH
ELECTION
FOR
PRESIDENT
THE
CLOSEST
HITLER
EVER
CAME
TO
DIRECT
ELECTION
HINDENBURG
HITLER
THAELMANN
DUESTERBERG
IN
THE
RUNOFF
ELECTION
IN
APRIL
THE
RESULTS
WERE
HINDENBURG
HITLER
THAELMANN
SO
WE
CAN
SEE
THAT
HITLER
PERSONALLY
WAS
SUPPORTED
BY
ONLY
ABOUT
A
THIRD
OF
GERMAN
VOTERS
SIMILARLY
THE
NAZI
PARTY
NEVER
RECEIVED
MORE
THAN
OF
THE
VOTE
IN
REICHSTAG
ELECTIONS
THAT
OCCURRED
IN
JULY
IN
THE
NOVEMBER
ELECTION
THE
NAZIS
LOST
TWO
MILLION
VOTES
AND
SEATS
DOWN
FROM
TO
OUT
OF
THE
IN
THE
REICHSTAG
COMPARITIVELY
THE
SOCIALISTS
HAD
AND
THE
COMMUNISTS
THE
COMMUNISTS
HAD
GAINED
SEATS
AND
THE
GERMAN
NATIONAL
PARTY
WHICH
HAD
SUPPORTED
THE
PREVIOUS
GOVERNMENT
HAD
PICKED
UP
A
MILLION
OF
THE
NAZIS
LOST
VOTES
TO
GAIN
SEATS
UP
TO
I
THINK
THE
OTHER
LARGE
PARTY
WAS
THE
CATHOLIC
CENTER
PARTY
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
MANY
SEATS
THEY
HAD
BUT
I
THINK
THEY
WERE
DECLINING
AND
THERE
WERE
NUMEROUS
OTHER
SMALL
PARTIES
THUS
THE
NAZI
VOTE
WAS
ON
THE
DECLINE
AT
THE
TIME
HITLER
WAS
APPOINTED
CHANCELLOR
WHAT
BROUGHT
HITLER
TO
POWER
WAS
NOT
THE
DEMAND
OF
THE
GERMAN
PEOPLE
FOR
HITLER
OR
THE
NAZIS
TO
RUN
THINGS
BUT
THE
INABILITY
OF
THE
OTHER
PARTIES
TO
PUT
THEIR
DIFFERENCES
BEHIND
THEM
IN
FAVOR
OF
FORMING
AN
EFFECTIVE
GOVERNMENT
FOR
THE
COUNTRY
GERMANY
DID
NOT
HAVE
AN
ENDURING
DEMOCRATIC
TRADITION
AND
THEIR
PARLIAMENTARY
SYSTEM
LACKED
EFFECTIVE
CENTER
PARTIES
THAT
FAVORED
THE
INTERESTS
OF
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
POPULATION
INSTEAD
WHAT
THEY
HAD
WAS
A
NUMBER
OF
SMALL
PARTIES
WHO
WERE
UNABLE
TO
PUT
ASIDE
THEIR
OWN
SPECIFIC
OBJECTIVES
IN
ORDER
TO
COMBINE
AGAINST
THE
NAZIS
WHO
WERE
OUT
TO
END
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
IN
FACT
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
OTHER
PARTIES
WITH
SUBSTANTIAL
REPRESENTATION
LIKE
THE
COMMUNISTS
WERE
ALSO
OUT
TO
END
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
BUT
WITH
DIFFERENT
RESULTS
IN
MIND
AND
GENERALLY
DIDNT
MIND
SEEING
PARLIAMENTARY
DEMOCRACY
GO
UNDER
GERMANY
HAD
ALREADY
HAD
A
NONNAZI
CHANCELLOR
WITH
A
MAJORITY
COALITION
FOR
FIVE
MONTHS
WHILE
THE
NAZIS
HAD
BEEN
THE
LARGEST
REICHSTAG
PARTY
AND
THERE
CERTAINLY
WAS
NO
DANGER
OF
A
REVOLUTION
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
NAZIS
IF
ANYTHING
THE
NAZIS
WERE
STARTING
TO
GET
DESPERATE
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
FAILED
TO
GET
ENOUGH
SUPPORT
TO
MAKE
HITLER
PRESIDENT
AND
THEIR
POPULAR
VOTE
HAD
BEGUN
TO
DECLINE
HITLER
WAS
NOT
HINDENBURGS
FIRST
CHOICE
TO
BE
CHANCELLOR
NOT
EVEN
HIS
SECOND
CHOICE
FIRST
VON
PAPEN
HAD
BEEN
CHANCELLOR
SINCE
JUNE
AFTER
THE
NOVEMBER
ELECTION
WHEN
THE
NAZIS
LOST
SEATS
HINDENBURG
FIRST
PREVAILED
ON
VON
PAPEN
TO
REMAIN
AS
CHANCELLOR
BUT
THERE
WERE
INTRIGUES
BEHIND
HIS
BACK
AND
SUPPORT
FOR
HIM
WAS
LACKING
SO
THEN
HINDENBURG
TURNED
TO
VON
SCHLEICHER
WHO
BECAME
CHANCELLOR
FOR
TWO
MONTHS
EVENTUALLY
HE
TOO
WAS
UNABLE
TO
HOLD
TOGETHER
A
WORKING
COALITION
OF
PARTIES
TO
OPPOSE
THE
NAZIS
WHO
REFUSED
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
ANY
GOVERNMENT
THAT
WAS
NOT
LED
BY
A
NAZI
CHANCELLOR
SOME
OF
THE
NAZI
LEADERSHIP
PARTICULARLY
GREGOR
STRASSER
WHO
WAS
THE
MAN
IN
THE
PARTY
AT
THE
TIME
WANTED
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
A
COALITION
GOVERNMENT
BUT
OTHERS
KNOWING
THE
PARTYS
SUPPORT
WAS
WANING
FIGURED
THAT
THEIR
BEST
HOPE
TO
GAIN
POWER
LAY
IN
UNDERMINING
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
NEVERTHELESS
THE
COUNTRY
WAS
GOVERNED
FOR
SEVEN
MONTHS
BY
CHANCELLORS
WHO
WERE
NOT
NAZIS
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
NAZIS
WERE
THE
LARGEST
REICHSTAG
PARTY
THE
FAILURE
OF
THESE
MEN
TO
ACHIEVE
A
WORKING
COALITION
WAS
DUE
TO
THE
INABILITY
OF
THEIR
COALITION
PARTIES
TO
WORK
TOGETHER
HERES
HOW
WILLIAM
SHIRER
PUTS
IT
IN
THE
RISE
AND
FALL
OF
THE
THIRD
REICH
THE
CARDINAL
ERROR
OF
THE
GERMANS
WHO
OPPOSED
NAZISM
WAS
THEIR
FAILURE
TO
UNITE
AGAINST
IT
AT
THE
CREST
OF
THEIR
POPULAR
STRENGTH
IN
JULY
THE
NATIONAL
SOCIALISTS
HAD
ATTAINED
BUT
PERCENT
OF
THE
VOTE
BUT
THE
PERCENT
OF
THE
GERMAN
PEOPLE
WHO
EXPRESSED
THEIR
OPPOSITION
TO
HITLER
WERE
MUCH
TOO
DIVIDED
AND
SHORTSIGHTED
TO
COMBINE
AGAINST
A
COMMON
DANGER
WHICH
THEY
MUST
HAVE
KNOWN
WOULD
OVERWHELM
THEM
UNLESS
THEY
UNITED
HOWEVER
TEMPORARILY
TO
STAMP
IT
OUT
TRUE
THE
GERMAN
PEOPLE
SUPPORTED
HITLER
AFTER
HE
BECAME
CHANCELLOR
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
CHANGE
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOT
OVERWHELMING
SUPPORT
FOR
HIM
BEFORE
HE
WAS
IN
POWER
THE
GERMAN
PEOPLE
WERE
NOT
CRYING
OUT
FOR
HITLER
TO
TAKE
OVER
NO
MATTER
HOW
BAD
ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS
WERE
THE
LEFTIST
PARTIES
SOCIALISTSCOMMUNISTS
PROBABLY
HAD
MORE
SUPPORT
IN
TOTAL
THAN
THE
NAZIS
HITLER
USED
THE
FACT
THAT
OTHERS
WERE
PASSIVELY
OR
ACTIVELY
WILLING
TO
SEE
THE
GOVERNMENT
PARALYZED
AS
A
MEANS
TO
TAKING
IT
OVER
