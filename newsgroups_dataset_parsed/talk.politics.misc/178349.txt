IN

WRITES
IT
IS
THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT
IS
PREVENTING
ENTRY
TO
THE
MARKET
THE
DESIRE
OF
THOSE
RUNNING
ESTABLISHED
BUSINESSES
TO
PREVENT
OR
RESTRICT
THE
ENTRY
OF
COMPETITORS
IS
AN
UNDERSTANDABLE
THOUGH
GENERALLY
UNPLEASANT
HUMAN
FAILING
BUT
WITHOUT
A
MEANS
TO
ACT
ON
THIS
DESIRE
WITHOUT
A
GOVERNMENT
WITH
SUFFICIENT
POWER
TO
RESTRICT
THE
OPTIONS
OF
THE
POTENTIAL
COMPETITOR
THE
ANTICOMPETITIVE
DESIRE
REMAINS
JUST
AN
UNPLEASANT
WISH
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
THE
LINCHPIN
SO
WE
SEEK
TO
DISENGAGE
IT
SO
WE
DONT
GET
THE
SHAFT
ONCE
AGAIN
MARK
YOU
DONT
SPECIFY
THE
MEANS
THROUGH
WHICH
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
TO
BE
PREVENTED
FROM
BECOMING
THE
TOOL
OF
BUSINESS
INTERESTS
AS
A
LEFTWING
BIG
GOVERNMENT
CONVENTIONAL
LIBERAL
IM
JUST
AS
WILLING
AS
YOU
ARE
TO
VOTE
AGAINST
ANTICOMPETITIVE
REGULATIONS
THAT
FAVOR
AUTO
DEALERS
BUT
WHAT
I
HEAR
FROM
LIBERTARIANS
IS
A
DESIRE
TO
LIMIT
INCUMBENTS
TERMS
TO
WEAKEN
GOVERNMENT
BY
ELIMINATING
ITS
POWER
TO
ENFORCE
ANTITRUST
LAWS
AND
A
DESIRE
TO
ELIMINATE
LEGISLATORS
PAY
EACH
STRIKES
ME
AS
A
PARTICULARLY
INEFFECTIVE
WAY
TO
INSURE
THAT
AUTO
DEALERS
AND
OTHER
SPECIAL
INTERESTS
CANNOT
INFLUENCE
PUBLIC
POLICY
IN
FACT
THEY
SEEM
CLEARLY
DESIGNED
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THE
OPPOSITE
THIS
IS
SIMILAR
TO
MY
SAYING
THAT
CLINTONS
TIMBER
SUMMIT
DOES
LITTLE
TO
FIX
THE
HEALTH
CARE
PROBLEM
LOOK
AT
THE
WHOLE
PICTURE
NOT
JUST
RANDOMLY
PICKED
LIBERTARIAN
POSITIONS
IF
GOVERNMENT
IS
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
USE
NONINITIATED
FORCE
TO
ACHIEVE
ITS
GOALS
THAN
NO
SPECIAL
INTEREST
CAN
INFLUENCE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
USE
NONINITIATED
FORCE
ON
THEIR
BEHALF
THE
MEANS
TO
REACHING
SUCH
A
RESTRICTED
GOVERNMENT
IS
ANOTHER
TOPIC
WHICH
ILL
ADDRESS
BRIEFLY
IT
CERTAINLY
WONT
HAPPEN
UNTIL
LIBERTARIANISM
IS
THE
DOMINATE
PHILOSOPHY
WHAT
MEANS
DO
WE
HAVE
TO
MAKE
LIBERTARIANISM
THE
DOMINATE
PHILOSOPHY
STATISTS
RUN
THE
EDUCATION
MONOPOLY
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CREATIVE
THE
ADVOCATES
FOR
SELFGOVERNMENT
REPORTS
OF
THEIR
SEMINAR
PARTICIPANTS
EMBRACE
LIBERTARIANISM
THATS
THE
BEST
MEANS
IVE
SEEN
YET
WE
SHOULD
LOBBY
FOR
COMPULSORY
SEMINAR
ATTENDANCE
IN
JEST
ROGER
COLLINS
ITS
AMAZING
TO
ME
THAT
GOVERNMENTS
AROUND
THE
WORLD
WILL
TRY
EVERY
ASPECT
OF
GOVERNMENT
CONTROL
BEFORE
AS
A
FINAL
LAST
RESORT
AFTER
EVERYTHING
ELSE
FAILS
THEY
WILL
TRY
INDIVIDUAL
