NC
VERDICT
TFARRELLLYNXDACNORTHEASTERNEDU
THOMAS
FARRELL
WRITES
SO
YOU
FEEL
THAT
THE
DEFENDENTS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONVICTED
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
NOW
THAT
WOULD
TRUELY
BE
A
SAD
DAY
FOR
CIVIL
RIGHTS
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
EVERYBODY
ELSE
BUT
TO
ME
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONVICTED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
WHICH
IN
MY
MIND
WAS
QUITE
SUFFICIENT
WHAT
EVIDENCE
ARE
YOU
AWARE
OF
WHAT
WAS
REPORTED
IN
THE
MEDIA
OR
ALL
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
THAT
WAS
PRESENTED
AT
THE
TRIAL
THIS
SOUNDS
TO
ME
A
LOT
LIKE
THE
FIRST
RODNEY
KING
TRIAL
A
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
SAW
TO
SECONDS
OUT
OF
A
SEVERAL
MINUTE
LONG
VIDEO
DECIDED
THAT
THEY
KNEW
MORE
THAN
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
SAT
THROUGH
A
TWO
WEEK
TRIAL
MOB
RULE
ISNT
ANY
PRETTIER
MERELY
BECAUSE
THE
MOB
CALLS
ITSELF
A
GOVERNMENT
IT
AINT
CHARITY
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
SOMEONE
ELSES
MONEY
WILSONS
THEORY
OF
RELATIVITY
IF
YOU
GO
BACK
FAR
ENOUGH
WERE
ALL
RELATED
