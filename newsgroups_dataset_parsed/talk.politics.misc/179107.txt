WHATS
GOOD
FOR
THE
GANDER
YOU
DONT
WANT
HOMOSEXUALS
TO
IMPOSE
THEIR
MORAL
CODES
SUCH
DIABOLICAL
IDEAS
AS
EQUAL
RIGHTS
ON
YOU
YET
YOU
ARE
WILLING
TO
IMPOSE
YOUR
MORAL
CODES
ON
THEM
DO
I
DETECT
A
DOUBLE
STANDARD
GARISON
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
IF
ADULTS
WANT
TO
GET
TOGETHER
FOR
SODOMY
IN
PRIVATE
THATS
THEIR
BUSINESS
AND
THATS
PRECISELY
WHAT
THEY
DO
SO
WHATS
YOUR

SCHNOPIA
DO
IT
IN
PRIVATE
AND
IT
WONT
BE
A
PROBLEM
BUT
THE
REASON
THAT
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
ACTIVISTS
ARE
SO
HOT
ON
ANTIDISCRIMINATION
LAWS
IS
THAT
THEY
WANT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
WEAR
THAT
LOVELY
CHIFFON
EVENING
GOWN
TO
WORK
AND
NOT
HAVE
PEOPLE
GET
DISGUSTED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
WEAR
THEIR
NAMBLA
TSHIRT
AND
NOT
WORRY
ABOUT
GETTING
FIRED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
YOUNG
BOYS
SO
THAT
THEY
START
MAKING
THE
NEXT
GENERATION
OF
HOMOSEXUALS
IF
YOUR
RIGHT
TO
PRIVACY
IS
WHAT
MAKES
SODOMY
LAWS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
A
POSITION
THAT
I
AGREE
WITH
THEN
KEEP
IT
PRIVATE
AND
THERE
WONT
BE
A
PROBLEM
