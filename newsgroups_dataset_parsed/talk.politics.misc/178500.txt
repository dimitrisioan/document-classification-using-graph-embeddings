SOCIALISM
MAY
HAVE
COLLAPSED
IN
EASTERN
EUROPE
AND
THE
SOVIET

BUT
IT
LINGERS
ON
IN

AND
THE

IT
REMAINS
THE
PRIMARY
IDEOLOGY
IN

HEARTS
AND
MINDS
OF

ALL
THE
POLITICAL

THREATEN

COLLAPSE
FROM

INDEED
IT
IS
BECOMING
MORE
APPARENT
EVERY

THAT
SOCIALISM
MAY
NOT

SURVIVE
THE

OF

ED
OF

HAS
NEVER

REMARKABLE
KNOWLEGE
OF

OR
ANY

COME
TO
THAT
WHILE
THE
SWEDES
HAVE
ALREADY
DISCARDED
THEIR
THIRD
WAY
AND
THE
FRENCH
HAVE
MADE
HISTORY
BY
TURNING
OUT
THE
SOCIALIST
PARTY
IN
A
RECORDSETTING
DEFEAT
IT
IS
ITALY
THAT
APPEARS
MOST
PRECARIOUSLY
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
ITS
POLITICAL
EXISTENCE
THAT
LEAVES
GERMANY
JAPAN
AND
THE
UK
AS
EXAMPLES
OF
A
COUNTRY
WHERE
THE
RIGHT
WING
GOVERNMENT
IS
ON
THE
VERGE
OF
COLLAPSE
OH
AND
OF

THE
USA
WHICH
JUST
ELECTED
A
SOCIALIST
GOVERNMENT
ITALY
TODAY
IS
A
BASKETCASE
EVEN
BY

STANDARDS
IT

INTRODUCED

UNFORTUNATELY
YOU

ON
THE
LEFT
OR

BOTH
ARE
TO
BLAME
BOTH
SIDES
ARE
EQUALLY
DEEP
INTO
THE
CORRUPTION
SCANDAL
THE
ONLY
UNTAINED
PARTY
IS
THE
NORTHERN
LEAGUE
WHICH
IS
A
BUNCH
OF
NATIONALIST
SEPARATISTS
AND
THE
COMMUNIST
PARTY
WHICH
HAS
COLLAPSED
IN
SPITE
OF
THIS
POLITICAL
GLUTENY
IT
HAS
AN
ANNUAL
DEFICIT
EXCEEDING
THE
SUM
OF
ALL
OTHER
EC
COUNTRIES
AND
A
PUBLIC
DEBT
TIMES
THAT
OF
LATIN
AMERICA
ITALY
IS
UNDERSTANDABLY
HAVING
SERIOUS
TROUBLE
SELLING
ITS
TREASURY
BONDS
IN
THE

AND
WHILE
ITALY
IS
AN
EXTREME
CASE
IT
IS
ANYTHING
BUT
UNIQUE
ALL
EUROPEAN
GOVERNMENTS
APPEAR
HEADED
IN
THE
SAME
DIRECTION
IN
SPITE
OF
THEIR
NOMINALLY
NONSOCIALIST
GOVERNMENTS
UNFORTUNATELY
EUROPEANS
BEING
WELL
EUROPEANS
IT
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
THAT
THEY
WILL
DISCOVER
AMERICANSTYLE
LIBERTY
INSTEAD
THEY
WILL
LIKELY
LURCH
FROM
SOCIALISM
TO
FASCISM
AS
QUICKLY
AS
THEY
HAD
MOVED
FROM
FASCISM
TO
SOCIALISM
NEVER
PAUSING
ALONG
THE
WAY
TO
REASSESES
THE

OF

ITSELF
I
HOPE
I
AM
WRONG
ED
SHOULD
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
BUDGET
DEFICIT
REGAN
AND
BUSH
CREATED
TOGETHER
BEFORE
HE
STARTS
TO
MAKE
CLAIMS
ABOUT
EUROPE
COLLAPSING
BASED
ON
THE
BUDGET
DEFICITS
HERE
NONE
OF
THEM
ARE
SERIOUS
ON
THE
USA
SCALE
AND
HERE
IN
EUROPE
WE
HAVE
ZERO
INTEREST
IN
EDIPSER
TYPE
FREED
THANK
YOU
WE
DO
NOT
WANT
OUR
COUNTRIES
TO
BE
RUN
BY
A
NARROW
ELITE
OF
RICH
LAWYERS
FOR
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
SUPER
WEALTHY
WE
ARE
QUITE
HAPPY
WITH
SOCIAL
DEMOCRACY
AND
DESPITE
THE
FUSS
MADE
IN
TIME
AND
NEWSWEEK
THERE
IS
REMARKABLY
LITTLE
BEING
DONE
TO
REVERSE
THE
SOCIAL
WELFARE
REFORMS
BROUGHT
IN
BY
SOCIALISM
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
SOCIALISM
IS
THAT
IT
STARTED
WITH
THE
AIMS
OF
FREE
EDUCATION
AND
HEALTH
CARE
AND
PROVISION
OF
THE
WELFARE
STATE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
ACHIEVED
ACROSS
THE
WHOLE
OF
EUROPE
ONLY
THE
USA
IS
STRUGGLING
TO
CATCH
UP
THE
PROBLEM
FOR
SOCIALISM
IS
WHAT
TO
DO
NOW
IT
HAS
SUCCEEDED
NOBODY
EVER
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
COLLAPSE
OF
SOCIALISM
WOULD
BE
PRETTY
THE
DECLINE
OF
THE
NATIONSTATE
WILL
PROBABLY
LEAD
FIRST
TO
ANARCHY
SINCE

ESSENTIAL
SERVICES
BEFORE

RAMPANT
CRIME
AND
FRANTICALLY

BUT
IT
HAS
A
SPANKING
NEW
SUBWAY
THAT
NOBODY
WANTS
TO
USE
AND
WHICH
LIKE
EVERY
OTHER
PUBLIC
TRANSIT
SYSTEM
IN

WILL
NEVER

VIABLE

THUS

THE

HURTLE
TOWARD
CHAOS
EVEN
AS
THE
CENTURY
APPROACHES
RATHER
THE
OPPOSITE
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
IN

IS
THAT
THE
COMMUNIST

HAS
COLLAPSED
THIS
HAS
MEANT
THAT
THE
GRAND
COALITION
BETWEEN

WING

CRACK
DOWN
HARD
ON

ARRESTED
HALF
THE

THE
FACT
THAT

IS
INCIDENTAL
THE

OF
