CAN
YOU
PROVIDE
SOME
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
SLAVE
STATES
REGARDED
SLAVES
AS
NOT
HUMANS
THEY
WERE
OUTSIDE
OUR
SOCIETY
AND
SIMILAR
PHRASES
THAT
BASICALLY
MEANT
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
RECOGNIZED
AS
HAVING
THE
SAME
RIGHTS
AS
A
FREE
PERSON
BUT
THEY
WERE
NEVER
CONSIDERED
NOT
HUMAN
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
ISNT
THE
FACT
THAT
SLAVES
WERE
PURCHASED
AS
OPPOSED
TO
HIRED
ENOUGH
EVIDENCE
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
THOUGHT
AS
HUMANS
DIDNT
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
PROVIDE
BASIC
FREEDOMS
TO
HUMANS
THAT
WERE
NOT
AVAILABLE
TO
SLAVES
NOT
NECESSARILY
DISTINCTIONS
WERE
MADE
BETWEEN
CITIZENS
AND
PERSONS
THROUGHOUT
THE
US
AND
VARIOUS
STATE
CONSTITUTIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
FREE
BLACKS
HAD
SOME
RIGHTS
OF
CITIZENS
BUT
NOT
ALL
THE
RIGHTS
OF
CITIZENS
IM
CURIOUS
IF
THERE
WAS
AN
ADDITIONAL
LEVEL
OF
DISTINCTION
MADE
BY
THE
SLAVE
STATES
TO
RATIONALIZE
THEIR
TREATMENT
OF
SLAVES
OR
IF
THEY
JUST
IGNORED
THE
THEORETICAL
PROBLEMS
OF
SLAVE
OWNERSHIP
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
DOES
NOT
ONCE
REFER
TO
CITIZENS
BUT
IT
MAKES
SEVERAL
REFERENCES
TO
PEOPLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
ARTICLE
IV
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
TO
BE
SECURE
IN
THEIR
PERSONS
HOUSES
PAPERS
AND
EFFECTS
AGAINST
UNREASONABLE
SEARCHES
AND
SEIZURES
SHALL
NOT
BE
VIOLATED
ARTICLE
V
NO
PERSON
SHALL
BE
HELD
TO
ANSWER
FOR
A
CAPITAL
OR
OTHERWISE
INFAMOUS
CRIME
UNLESS
ON
A
PRESENTMENT
OR
INDICTMENT
BY
A
GRAND
JURY
NOR
SHALL
ANY
PERSON
BE
DEPRIVED
OF
LIFE
LIBERTY
OR
PROPERTY
WITHOUT
DUE
PROCESS
OF
LAW
ARTICLE
VIII
EXCESSIVE
BAIL
SHALL
NOT
BE
REQUIRED
NOR
EXCESSIVE
FINES
IMPOSED
NOR
CRUEL
AND
UNUSUAL
PUNISHMENTS
INFLICTED
NOW
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
THAT
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS
APPLY
ONLY
TO
CITIZENS
ARENT
THEY
MEANT
TO
APPLY
EQUALLY
TO
ALL
PERSONS
LIVING
IN
THE
US
WHETHER
SLAVES
WERE
CONSIDERED
NOT
HUMAN
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
A
CASE
COULD
BE
MADE
THAT
THEY
WERENT
TREATED
AS
PEOPLE
AS
DEFINED
IN
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
AND
SINCE
THE
NATION
IS
NOMINALLY
BASED
ON
THE
DECLARATION
OF
INDEPENDENCE
WHICH
STATES
THAT
ALL
MEN
ARE
CREATED
EQUAL
THAT
THEY
ARE
ENDOWED
BY
THEIR
CREATOR
WITH
CERTAIN
UNALIENABLE
RIGHTS
THAT
AMONG
THESE
ARE
LIFE
LIBERTY
AND
THE
PURSUIT
OF
HAPPINESS
IT
WOULD
ALSO
SEEM
THAT
SLAVES
WOULD
NOT
FOLLOW
UNDER
THIS
DEFINITION
OF
HUMANITY
