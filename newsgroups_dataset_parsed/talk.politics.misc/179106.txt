the
government
is
lying
yesterday
the
fbi
was
saying
that
at
least
three
of
the
bodies
had
gunshot
wounds
indicating
that
they
were
shot
trying
to
escape
the
fire
todays
paper
quotes
the
medical
examiner
as
saying
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
gunshot
wounds
in
any
of
the
recovered
bodies
at
the
beginning
of
this
siege
it
was
reported
that
while
koresh
had
a
class
iii
machine
gun
license
todays
paper
quotes
the
government
as
saying
no
they
didnt
have
a
license
todays
paper
reports
that
a
number
of
the
bodies
were
found
with
shoulder
weapons
next
to
them
as
if
they
had
been
using
them
while
dying
which
doesnt
sound
like
the
sort
of
action
i
would
expect
from
a
suicide
our
government
lies
as
it
tries
to
cover
over
its
incompetence
and
negligence
why
should
i
believe
the
fbis
claims
about
anything
else
when
we
can
see
that
they
are
lying
this
system
of
government
is
beyond
reform
