hadnt
realized
how
venomous
this
was
getting
be
careful
herethe
problem
isnt
the
rich
but
the
values
and
the
systems
that
make
the
rich
rich
things
are
designed
in
such
a
way
that
in
order
to
go
with
the
system
and
make
money
everything
else
we
care
about
goes
to
shit
i
have
to
constantly
remind
myself
that
the
goal
of
human
society
is
not
to
make
money
money
doesnt
make
us
happy
it
just
prevents
certain
things
making
us
more
unhappy
therefore
dont
shoot
the
rich

the
conservatives
