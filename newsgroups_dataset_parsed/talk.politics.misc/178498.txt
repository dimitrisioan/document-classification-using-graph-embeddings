last
night
clinton
was
bashing
the
republicans
for
stonewalling
his
so
called
stimulus
package
it
seems
that
one
small
item
within
this
package
was
going
to
pay
for
free
immunizations
for
poor
kids
immunizations
for
children
in
this
country
are
already
free
if
you
care
to
go
have
it
done
the
problem
is
not
the
cost
it
is
the
irresponible
parents
who
are
to
stupid
or
to
lazy
to
have
it
done
in
case
you
havent
noticed
clintonites
are
pushing
a
universal
health
care
access
program
access
here
means
that
folks
who
do
not
give
a
damn
about
immunizing
their
children
will
have
health
care
services
delivered
to
their
doorsteps
ive
read
about
more
than
a
few
of
these
programs
that
ran
into
problems
in
convincing
parents
to
get
their
children
immunized
even
when
they
were
delivered
to
their
doorstep
i
dont
know
maybe
that
sheet
they
have
to
be
informed
of
about
possible
risks
side
effects
and
bad
reactions
scares
them
