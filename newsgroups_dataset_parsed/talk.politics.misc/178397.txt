RE
TOP
TEN
SIGNS
THAT
ITS
THE
AGE
OF
AQUARIUS
ON
PENNSYLVANIA
AVENUE
IN
REGARD
TO
WOODYS
POST
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
REMIND
HIM
OF
SOMETHING
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
HIS
TIRADE
AGAINST
ACADEMIA
AS
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
GENERATION
LIKELY
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
CRAP
REAGAN
AND
HIS
CRONIES
STARTED
WITH
THE
DEFICIT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
BRILLIANT
LAFFER
CURVE
NOT
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
LOOK
WITH
OPEN
MINDS
UPON
ANY
IDEAS
WHICH
WILL
ALLOW
US
TO
DIRECTLY
ADDRESS
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
THE
GIGANTIC
FEDERAL
DEFICIT
AND
DEBT
AND
CONTINUE
TO
ALLOW
OUR
ECONOMY
TO
EXPANDAND
I
DONT
REMEMBER
WOODY
AND
CO
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
ACADEMIA
WHILE
LAFFER
IMPLEMENTED
HIS
POLICY
STOCKMAN
APPROVED
IT
WHILE
BEING
FULLY
AWARE
THE
NUMBERS
NOT
ADDING
UP
AND
REAGAN
COMPLETING
THE
LARGEST
CON
JOB
OF
THE
CENTURY
WHICH
MY
GENERATION
AND
I
WILL
NOW
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
JESSE
