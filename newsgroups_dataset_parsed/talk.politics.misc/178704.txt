janet
reno
killed
the
waco
children
she
is
responsible
for
their
deaths
she
should
resign
immediately
she
should
have
understood
that
david
koresh
was
a
madman
who
would
do
anything
against
the
children
if
he
became
provoked
all
the
warning
signs
were
there
and
she
ignored
them
she
provoked
koresh
into
killing
the
children
the
situation
in
waco
was
similar
to
a
hostage
situation
with
a
madman
holding
a
gun
against
the
head
of
an
innocent
person
in
such
a
situation
a
person
who
provokes
the
madman
and
causes
him
to
pull
the
guns
trigger
is
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
hostage
janet
reno
blindly
stumbled
in
there
and
basically
threw
a
tear
gas
container
at
the
madman
hoping
that
he
would
release
the
hostage
its
no
surprise
that
the
madman
would
pull
the
trigger
in
response
to
that
kind
of
provocation
