REMARKS
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
AT

JOBS
CONFERENCE
HYATT
REGENCY
CRYSTAL
CITY
VIRGINIA
AM
EDT
THE
PRESIDENT
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
THE
SPEECH
THAT
OCTAVIUS
GAVE
SAYS
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
I
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
SAY
TODAY
ABOUT
WHY
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
GIVE
ALL
OF
OUR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
A
CHANCE
TO
GET
A
WORK
EXPERIENCE
AND
TO
CONTINUE
TO
LEARN
TO
MERGE
THE
NATURE
OF
LEARNING
AND
WORK
WHY
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
HONOR
THE
EFFORTS
OF
PEOPLE
LIKE
JERRY
LEVIN
AND
NANCYE
COMBS
AND
PAT
IRVING
AND
ALL
OF
THOSE
WHO
ARE
HERE
I
WANT
TO
THANK
THE
SECRETARIES
OF
LABOR
AND
EDUCATION
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WORK
WITH
THEM
FOR
SPONSORING
THIS
AND
MY
GOOD
FRIEND
GOVERNOR
WILDER
FOR
BEING
HERE
AND
FOR
SPEAKING
AND
ALL
OF
THE
BUSINESS
AND
LOCAL
COMMUNITY
LEADERS
FROM
THE
CITY
AND
COUNTY
AND
STATE
LEVEL
FROM
AROUND
AMERICA
WHO
ARE
HERE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
PRETTY
FUN
DAY
LAUGHTER
I
LOVED
HEARING
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
SING
IT
WAS
MUSIC
TO
MY
EARS
BECAUSE
IT
IS
THEIR
FUTURE
THAT
WE
ARE
REALLY
STRUGGLING
ABOUT
APPLAUSE
A
YEAR
AND
A
HALF
AGO
I
BEGAN
THE
QUEST
TO
SEEK
THE
PRESIDENCY
BECAUSE
I
WAS
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THEIR
FUTURE
BECAUSE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
OUR
COUNTRY
WHICH
HAD
ALWAYS
BEEN
A
BEACON
OF
HOPE
FOR
THE
YOUNG
HAD
TOO
LITTLE
OPPORTUNITY
WAS
TOO
DIVIDED
AMONG
OURSELVES
ACROSS
LINES
OF
INCOME
AND
RACE
AND
REGION
AND
OTHER
WAYS
WITHOUT
A
VISION
TO
TAKE
US
INTO
THE
FUTURE
I
ENTERED
WITH
THE
HOPE
THAT
TOGETHER
WE
COULD
CREATE
MORE
OPPORTUNITY
AND
INSIST
ON
MUCH
MORE
RESPONSIBILITY
FROM
ALL
OF
OUR
PEOPLE
BUT
IN
THE
PROCESS
WE
MIGHT
RECREATE
THE
BEST
OF
AMERICAS
COMMUNITY
KNOWING
THAT
TOGETHER
WE
COULD
ALWAYS
TO
MORE
THAN
WE
COULD
INDIVIDUALLY
AND
THAT
WE
MIGHT
SECURE
OUR
FUTURE
ALL
OF
YOU
HERE
TODAY
ARE
COMMITTED
TO
THAT
THE
JOBS
THAT
JERRY
LEVIN
HAS
COMMITTED
TIMEWARNER
TO
IS
SYMBOLIC
OF
THE
COMMITMENTS
MADE
BY
MANY
OF
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
HERE
AND
THOSE
WHO
ARE
AROUND
THE
COUNTRY
THE
WORK
THAT
NANCYE
COMBS
DOES
AND
THE
SUCCESSES
OF
ALL
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
LIKE
THOSE
ON
THIS
STAGE
AND
ESPECIALLY
THE
ELOQUENT
STATEMENT
OCTAVIUS
JEFFERS
ALL
THOSE
THINGS
SHOW
THAT
TOGETHER
WE
KNOW
WHAT
WE
NEED
TO
DO
AND
WERE
ON
THE
RIGHT
TRACK
LAST
JULY
WHEN
I
WAS
TRAVELING
ACROSS
AMERICAS
HEARTLAND
IN
MY
LUXURIOUS
BUS
I
VISITED
SENECA
HIGH
SCHOOL
IN
LOUISVILLE
KENTUCKY
AND
THERE
I
MET
YOUNG
PEOPLE
AND
BUSINESS
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
PARTICIPATING
IN
THE
LOUISVILLE
EDUCATION
AND
EMPLOYMENT
PARTNERSHIP
I
SAW
WHAT
NANCYE
COMBS
TALKED
ABOUT
TODAY
I
SAW
HOW
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WERE
MAKING
AN
EXTRA
EFFORT
TO
SUCCEED
BOTH
IN
SCHOOL
AND
AT
WORK
I
SAW
AS
I
HAVE
SEEN
MANY
TIMES
IN
MY
OWN
STATE
THE
PRINCIPLE
ILLUSTRATED
THAT
OCTAVIUS
HAS
TALKED
ABOUT
THAT
FOR
MILLIONS
OF
AMERICAN
YOUNG
PEOPLE
IT
IS
REALLY
AN
IMPEDIMENT
TO
BOTH
THEIR
LEARNING
AND
THEIR
ABILITY
TO
BE
GOOD
WORKERS
TO
DRAW
A
SHARP
DIVIDING
LINE
BETWEEN
WHAT
IS
WORK
AND
WHAT
IS
LEARNING
IN
THE
WORLD
IN
WHICH
WE
ARE
LIVING
THE
AVERAGE
YOUNG
PERSON
WILL
CHANGE
THE
NATURE
OF
WORK
SEVEN
OR
EIGHT
TIMES
IN
A
LIFETIME
WE
MUST
LEARN
TO
MERGE
THE
WORK
WORLD
AND
THE
LEARNING
WORLD
MUCH
BETTER
AND
WE
MUST
DETERMINE
THAT
ALL
OF
OUR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
SEE
THE
OPPORTUNITIES
THAT
SOME
OF
THEM
HAVE
HAD
SHOWCASED
HERE
TODAY
WHETHER
YOURE
IN
BUSINESS
OR
IN
GOVERNMENT
OR
IN
EDUCATION
YOU
KNOW
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
BIG
JOB
TO
DO
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
BUILDING
A
FUTURE
THAT
REALLY
HONESTLY
INCLUDES
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
ALL
OF
OUR
PEOPLE
THERE
ARE
STILL
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
SAY
WELL
THINGS
ARE
PRETTY
GOOD
HERE
IN
WASHINGTON
AND
EVERYTHINGS
FINE
THE
BEST
THING
WE
CAN
DO
ABOUT
THIS
WHOLE
THING
IS
NOTHING
THEY
ALL
HAVE
JOBS
LAUGHTER
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
SAY
THAT
APPLAUSE
THEY
ALL
HAVE
HEALTH
INSURANCE
THEY
ALL
HAVE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
EDUCATION
AND
THEY
ALL
HAVE
A
PRETTY
SECURE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
THEYLL
BE
OKAY
NO
MATTER
WHAT
HAPPENS
I
SAY
THAT
NOT
TO
BE
EITHER
POLITICAL
OR
UNDULY
CRITICAL
BUT
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
CHALLENGES
OF
THIS
AGE
FOR
EVERY
ADVANCED
NATION
EVERYONE
IS
TO
FULLY
DEVELOP
THE
CAPACITIES
OF
ALL
OF
ITS
PEOPLE
AND
THEN
FIND
WORK
FOR
THEM
TO
DO
ALL
THE
EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES
HAVE
HIGHER
UNEMPLOYMENT
RATES
THAN
WE
DO
BUT
ALSO
STRONGER
SUPPORT
SYSTEMS
FOR
THE
UNEMPLOYED
THE
JAPANESE
UNEMPLOYMENT
RATE
HAS
BEEN
GOING
UP
THEYRE
GOING
TO
ADOPT
A
STIMULUS
THAT
EVEN
IF
YOU
COUNT
IT
IN
ITS
MOST
RIGOROUS
TERMS
IS
THREE
OR
FOUR
TIMES
BIGGER
THAN
THE
ONE
THAT
I
HAVE
PROPOSED
TO
CREATE
JOBS
IN
WEST
GERMANY
ALONE
THE
UNEMPLOYMENT
RATE
IS
NOW
ABOUT
AS
HIGH
AS
OURS
THIS
IS
A
BIG
PROBLEM
FOR
ADVANCED
NATIONS
IT
COSTS
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
TO
ADD
AN
EXTRA
EMPLOYEE
WITH
A
LOT
OF
PRESSURE
FROM
LOWWAGE
PRODUCERS
IN
OTHER
COUNTRIES
THAT
ARE
GROWING
THEIR
OWN
ECONOMIES
AND
TRYING
TO
PROVIDE
NEW
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
THEIR
PEOPLE
BUT
IT
IS
ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT
FOR
AMERICA
FOR
TWO
REASONS
ONE
IS
WE
HAVE
A
WHOLE
LOT
OF
FOLKS
WHO
UNLESS
WE
MOVE
AGGRESSIVELY
WILL
NOT
HAVE
THE
EDUCATION
AND
SKILLS
WE
NEED
TO
BE
COMPETITIVE
AND
PRODUCTIVE
IN
A
NATION
LIKE
THIS
THE
SECOND
IS
EVEN
IF
WE
EDUCATE
THEM
ALL
IF
THERE
ARENT
JOBS
THEY
WILL
BE
ROBBED
OF
THE
FRUITS
OF
THEIR
EDUCATIONAL
LABORS
PEOPLE
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
WORK
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
APPLAUSE
WE
HAVE
ALWAYS
HAD
SOME
UNEMPLOYMENT
AND
INDEED
SOME
OF
IT
IS
NORMAL
YOUVE
ALWAYS
GOT
SOME
PEOPLE
LEAVING
JOBS
AND
MOVING
AROUND
THE
COUNTRY
AND
DOING
FIRST
ONE
THING
AND
ANOTHER
WE
HAVE
NOW
AT
THIS
MOMENT
IN
OUR
HISTORY
THE
NECESSITY
FOR
ALL
BIG
ORGANIZATIONS
INCLUDING
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
REEXAMINE
THE
WAY
THEY
ARE
ORGANIZED
AND
WHO
ASK
WHETHER
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
WORKING
AT
SOME
KINDS
OF
JOBS
BUT
IN
THE
WHOLE
WE
MUST
STILL
BE
ABLE
TO
CREATE
JOBS
IN
A
COUNTRY
LIKE
AMERICA
TO
PROVIDE
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
CHANCE
TO
WORK
ITS
GOING
TO
BE
DIFFICULT
FOR
ME
TO
MAKE
THE
WELFARE
REFORM
PROPOSALS
THAT
I
WILL
MAKE
TO
CONGRESS
IN
THE
NEXT
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
ITS
GOING
TO
BE
HARD
FOR
ME
TO
MAKE
THOSE
WORK
IF
AT
THE
END
OF
ALL
THIS
WORK
TO
GET
OFF
WELFARE
THERE
ISNT
A
JOB
APPLAUSE
SO
WE
HAVE
TWO
TASKS
ONE
IS
TO
DEVELOP
THE
CAPACITY
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
TO
PERFORM
WITHOUT
REGARD
TO
RACE
OR
INCOME
OR
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF
THEIR
BIRTH
THE
OTHER
IS
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
THEM
TO
BRING
TO
BEAR
FOR
THEIR
TALENT
AND
TO
BE
REWARDED
WITH
A
PAYCHECK
IT
IS
A
GREAT
CHALLENGE
I
DO
NOT
PRETEND
THAT
ALL
OF
THE
ANSWERS
ARE
SIMPLE
BUT
I
KNOW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
ASK
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
ALL
OF
THEM
TO
BE
MORE
RESPONSIBLE
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
RECREATE
A
SENSE
OF
COMMUNITY
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
THAT
BRIDGES
THE
LINES
OF
RACE
AND
INCOME
AND
REGION
YOU
HAVE
GOT
TO
HAVE
OPPORTUNITY
IN
THAT
MIX
A
PART
OF
OUR
VISION
FOR
AMERICA
HAS
TO
BE
A
FUTURE
FOR
EVERY
YOUNG
PERSON
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
WHOS
WILLING
TO
PLAY
BY
THE
RULES
AND
WORK
HARD
AND
STRIVE
FOR
THE
END
OF
THE
RAINBOW
THERE
HAS
TO
BE
SOMETHING
AT
THE
END
OF
THAT
RAINBOW
AND
THAT
IS
WHAT
WE
ARE
BASICALLY
HERE
TO
TALK
ABOUT
TODAY
WHAT
CAN
WE
ALL
DO
AS
PARTNERS
RECOGNIZING
NONE
OF
US
CAN
DO
IT
ALONE
TO
DEVELOP
THE
CAPACITIES
OF
OUR
PEOPLE
TO
SUCCEED
WHEREVER
THEY
LIVE
AND
WHATEVER
THEIR
BACKGROUND
AND
THEN
WHAT
CAN
WE
DO
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THERES
SOMETHING
THERE
FOR
THEM
TO
DO
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
PROGRAM
WERE
DISCUSSING
TODAY
IS
AN
INTEGRAL
PART
OF
THAT
PLAN
BECAUSE
IT
WILL
PROMOTE
THE
VALUES
OF
WORK
AND
OPPORTUNITY
AND
FAIRNESS
COMMUNITY
IT
WILL
PUT
THE
PEOPLE
FIRST
AND
IT
DOES
HAVE
A
PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN
THE
PUBLIC
AND
PRIVATE
SECTOR
I
SAID
WHEN
I
ADDRESSED
THE
UNITED
STATES
CONGRESS
IN
FEBRUARY
ON
THIS
PROGRAM
THAT
I
WOULD
SEEK
TO
CREATE
ABOUT
EXTRA
SUMMER
JOBS
FROM
GOVERNMENT
SOURCES
AND
THEN
CHALLENGE
THE
AMERICAN
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
TO
MEET
THAT
TARGET
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
CREATE
MORE
THAN
A
MILLION
NEW
SUMMER
JOBS
OVER
AND
ABOVE
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
CREATED
BEFORE
MANY
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
RESPONDED
TO
THAT
CHALLENGE
AND
JERRY
IS
JUST
A
SHINING
EXAMPLE
OF
THAT
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
REPLICATED
IN
THIS
ROOM
AND
AROUND
THE
COUNTRY
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
MORE
THAN
THEY
OTHERWISE
WOULD
IN
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
TO
GIVE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
A
WORK
EXPERIENCE
AND
IT
IS
TERRIBLY
IMPORTANT
I
WANT
TO
EMPHASIZE
THAT
THIS
SUMMER
JOBS
PROGRAM
IS
PART
OF
AN
OVERALL
COMMITMENT
TO
INCREASE
THE
CAPACITY
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
FROM
RETRAINING
DEFENSE
WORKERS
WHO
LOSE
THEIR
JOBS
AND
OTHER
ADULTS
WHO
NEED
TO
ACQUIRE
NEW
SKILLS
TO
IMPROVING
THE
TRANSITION
FROM
SCHOOL
TO
WORK
FOR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
GO
TO
COLLEGE
BUT
DO
NEED
AT
LEAST
TWO
YEARS
OF
POSTHIGH
SCHOOL
TRAINING
EITHER
ON
THE
JOB
OR
IN
A
COMMUNITY
COLLEGE
OR
A
VOCATIONAL
SETTING
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
BE
COMPETITIVE
WORKERS
MAKING
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
MORE
PEOPLE
TO
GO
ON
TO
COLLEGE
WHO
DO
WANT
TO
GO
ALL
THESE
THINGS
ARE
PART
AND
PARCEL
OF
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PLAN
ITS
ALSO
IMPORTANT
AS
I
SAID
THAT
WE
CREATE
MORE
JOBS
THE
EMERGENCY
JOBS
PROGRAM
THAT
I
ASKED
THE
CONGRESS
TO
ADOPT
WOULD
CREATE
A
HALF
A
MILLION
EXTRA
JOBS
OVER
THE
NEXT
YEAR
AND
A
HALF
AND
THAT
WOULD
REDUCE
THE
UNEMPLOYMENT
RATE
BY
A
HALF
A
PERCENT
IT
WOULD
ALSO
ENABLE
US
TO
ABSORB
MORE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
COMING
INTO
THE
WORK
FORCE
IN
JOBS
THAT
OTHERWISE
WILL
NOT
BE
CREATED
IT
ALSO
WILL
HELP
A
LOT
OF
CITIES
AND
COUNTIES
TO
INVEST
IN
THINGS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
DONE
AT
THE
GRASSROOTS
LEVEL
PROJECTS
LONG
DELAYED
WATER
PROJECTS
SEWER
PROJECTS
PARK
PROJECTS
NEW
INDUSTRIES
AND
PARTICULARLY
IN
SMALL
AND
MEDIUMSIZE
COMMUNITIES
A
WHOLE
RANGE
OF
THINGS
THAT
WILL
IMPROVE
THE
ECONOMY
AND
IMPROVE
THE
ENVIRONMENT
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
PROGRAM
IS
AN
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THAT
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
TRIED
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THROUGH
THE
WORK
OF
THE
LABOR
DEPARTMENT
AND
THE
EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT
AND
THROUGH
REACHING
OUT
TO
PEOPLE
LIKE
YOU
TO
MAKE
THIS
MORE
THAN
JUST
A
ONESHOT
SUMMER
JOBS
PROGRAM
TO
INTEGRATE
IT
WITH
PRIVATE
SECTOR
EFFORTS
TO
HOPEFULLY
REPLICATE
IT
IN
EACH
COMING
SUMMER
TO
MOVE
THESE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
INTO
FURTHER
EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES
AND
TO
FURTHER
JOB
OPPORTUNITIES
AND
TO
HAVE
A
STRONG
MEANINGFUL
EDUCATION
COMPONENT
TO
THESE
SUMMER
JOBS
SOMETHING
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
GOVERNMENT
HAS
NEVER
FULLY
EMPHASIZED
BEFORE
A
LOT
OF
THESE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
AS
YOU
WELL
KNOW
BECAUSE
THEY
COME
FROM
DIFFICULT
BACKGROUNDS
BECAUSE
THEY
GO
TO
SCHOOL
IN
DIFFICULT
AND
CHALLENGING
CIRCUMSTANCES
NEED
EXTRA
HELP
IN
BUILDING
THEIR
BASIC
SKILLS
IN
MATH
AND
LANGUAGE
REASONING
AND
IN
OTHER
AREAS
AND
A
LOT
OF
EDUCATIONAL
STUDIES
SHOW
THAT
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
DIFFICULTY
IN
SCHOOL
OFTEN
FORGET
AS
MUCH
AS
PERCENT
OF
WHAT
THEY
LEARN
OVER
THE
SUMMER
AND
THEN
THAT
HAS
TO
BE
REPEATED
THE
NEXT
YEAR
WHAT
WE
ARE
TRYING
TO
DO
HERE
IS
TO
GIVE
PEOPLE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
LEARN
GOOD
WORK
HABITS
AND
TO
REINFORCE
THEIR
LEARNING
SKILLS
AND
TO
PUT
THEM
TOGETHER
AND
THEN
HOPEFULLY
OVER
THE
NEXT
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
IF
OUR
ENTIRE
PROGRAM
PASSES
TO
GIVE
EVERY
SCHOOL
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
HAVE
A
GOOD
WORK
AND
LEARNING
ENVIRONMENT
THERE
WILL
BE
MORE
APPLIED
ACADEMICS
MORE
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
LEARN
AND
WORK
DURING
THE
SCHOOL
YEAR
SO
THAT
THIS
WILL
NOT
SIMPLY
BE
AN
ISOLATED
MOMENT
FOR
THESE
YOUNG
FOLKS
BUT
WILL
BE
A
PART
OF
BUILDING
A
WHOLE
NEW
EDUCATIONAL
EXPERIENCE
A
WHOLE
NEW
WORK
EXPERIENCE
AND
MOVING
ON
A
PATHWAY
TO
A
BETTER
FUTURE
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
PROGRAMS
ARE
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
BE
MAKE
WORK
JOBS
THEYRE
DESIGNED
TO
MAKE
A
FUTURE
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
HOLDING
THE
JOB
AND
THATS
WHAT
THEY
WILL
DO
IN
THE
PROCESS
THEYLL
HELP
TO
BUILD
LOCAL
COMMUNITIES
TO
STRENGTHEN
LOCAL
ECONOMIES
TO
SOLVE
LOCAL
PROBLEMS
REAL
JOBS
RENOVATING
HOUSING
REPAIRING
PUBLIC
BUILDINGS
DOING
CLERICAL
WORK
PROVIDING
NURSING
ASSISTANCE
IN
HOSPITALS
SUPERVISING
AND
TRAINING
CHILDREN
AT
CHILD
CARE
CENTERS
AND
LEARNING
ALL
THE
WAY
CHALLENGING
YOUNG
PEOPLE
TO
LEARN
WHILE
THEY
EARN
BUT
LETTING
THEM
EARN
YOU
KNOW
ITS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
MAKE
A
CASE
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
OPPORTUNITY
ON
THEIR
OWN
STREET
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
DO
THIS
THAT
OR
THE
OTHER
THING
IF
THERES
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
OPPORTUNITY
THATS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
EFFORT
I
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
SPARING
IN
GOING
FOR
THE
LAST
YEARANDAHALF
INTO
PLACES
WHERE
IT
ISNT
EXACTLY
POPULAR
TO
SAY
IT
AND
SAY
I
WANTED
TO
REFORM
THE
WELFARE
SYSTEM
I
WANTED
TO
TOUGHEN
CHILD
SUPPORT
I
WANTED
TO
REQUIRE
PEOPLE
TO
WORK
I
WAS
SICK
AND
TIRED
OF
PEOPLE
BEING
IRRESPONSIBLE
IN
THE
USE
OF
GUNS
ON
THE
STREETS
AND
I
WANTED
TO
CHANGE
ALL
THAT
BUT
IF
YOURE
GOING
TO
SUMMON
PEOPLE
TO
GREATER
RESPONSIBILITY
YOU
HAVE
TO
REWARD
THEM
WHEN
THEY
DO
THE
RIGHT
THING
WITH
OPPORTUNITY
APPLAUSE
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WE
PROPOSE
TO
PUT
TO
WORK
UNDER
OUR
PROGRAM
WILL
SPEND
HOURS
LEARNING
BASIC
SKILLS
SUCH
AS
MATH
READING
WRITING
EITHER
ON
THE
JOB
IN
THE
CLASSROOM
THEY
WILL
STRETCH
THEIR
MINDS
AS
WELL
AS
WORK
UP
A
SWEAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
SENSE
OF
ACCOMPLISHMENT
IT
WILL
LITERALLY
BE
A
SUMMER
CHALLENGE
BUT
A
CHALLENGE
THAT
WILL
TAKE
THEM
INTO
A
DIFFERENT
LIFE
SO
I
WANT
TO
ASK
ALL
OF
YOU
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
EFFORT
EVEN
AS
I
AS
YOUR
PRESIDENT
SUPPORT
YOUR
EFFORT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SUMMER
WE
WILL
EVALUATE
ALL
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
PARTICIPATE
WELL
SEE
WHETHER
THEY
INSTEAD
OF
FALLING
BEHIND
OVER
THE
SUMMER
ACADEMICALLY
AS
TOO
MANY
YOUNG
PEOPLE
DO
THEY
STAYED
EVEN
OR
MOVED
AHEAD
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THEY
WILL
THIS
SUMMER
SECRETARY
REICH
AND
SECRETARY
RILEY
AND
I
WILL
BE
VISITING
MANY
OF
YOUR
COMMUNITIES
WELL
REALLY
TRY
TO
LEARN
FROM
YOU
WHICH
OF
THESE
EFFORTS
ARE
WORKING
WHAT
WE
SHOULD
DO
NEXT
SUMMER
HOW
WE
CAN
BUILD
IT
IN
TO
WHAT
GOES
ON
DURING
THE
SCHOOL
YEAR
HOW
WE
CAN
BUILD
IN
OUR
JOB
TRAINING
EFFORTS
AND
THE
WORKS
THAT
WE
DO
WITH
YOUR
COMPANIES
TO
MAKE
SENSE
OF
THIS
WHOLE
THING
SO
THAT
WE
MAXIMIZE
THE
IMPACT
OF
THE
TAXPAYER
DOLLAR
AND
YOUR
PRIVATE
INVESTMENTS
AS
WELL
WE
WANT
TO
HONOR
THE
COMPANIES
AND
THE
COMMUNITIES
THE
BUSINESS
LEADERS
AND
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
THE
VERY
BEST
JOBS
THIS
SUMMER
AND
AGAIN
I
WANT
TO
SAY
TO
ALL
OF
YOU
IN
PRIVATE
BUSINESS
WHO
HAVE
MATCHED
OUR
EFFORT
I
THANK
YOU
AND
TO
ALL
OF
YOU
WHO
HAVENT
AND
THOSE
ACROSS
THE
COUNTRY
WHO
MAY
LISTEN
OR
LEARN
ABOUT
THIS
EVENT
TODAY
I
WANT
TO
IMPLORE
OTHER
PRIVATE
EMPLOYERS
TO
STRETCH
A
LITTLE
BIT
TO
GIVE
OTHER
YOUNG
PEOPLE
A
CHANCE
TO
WORK
THIS
SUMMER
IM
TELLING
YOU
WE
CANNOT
GO
THROUGH
ANOTHER
YEARS
WHEN
WE
DONT
GIVE
THESE
CHILDREN
ANYTHING
TO
SAY
YES
TO
IF
WE
EXHORT
THEM
TO
DO
RIGHT
WEVE
GOT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
REWARD
THEM
APPLAUSE
WHEN
THE
OTHER
SPEAKERS
WERE
TALKING
I
WAS
SITTING
UP
HERE
ON
THE
PLATFORM
LISTENING
AND
REVELING
AND
THEY
GOT
TALKING
ABOUT
WORK
AND
I
GOT
TO
THINKING
ABOUT
ALL
THE
DIFFERENT
THINGS
IVE
DONE
TO
MAKE
A
LIVING
IN
MY
LIFE
WHEN
I
WAS
I
MADE
A
VERY
FOOLISH
SHORTTERM
BUSINESS
INVESTMENT
I
SET
UP
A
COMIC
BOOK
STAND
AND
SOLD
TWO
TRUNKS
FULL
OF
COMIC
BOOKS
MADE
MORE
MONEY
THAN
I
HAD
EVER
HAD
IN
MY
LIFE
BUT
IF
I
HAD
SAVED
THOSE
TRUNKS
THEYD
BE
WORTH
TODAY
LAUGHTER
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
YOUNG
PEOPLE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ENTREPRENEURIAL
IT
JUST
MEANS
THAT
YOU
CANT
FORESEE
A
GENERATION
AHEAD
I
HAVE
MOWED
YARDS
AND
CLEARED
LAND
AND
BUILT
HOUSES
AND
WORKED
IN
BODY
SHOPS
AND
THE
PARTS
DEPARTMENTS
OF
A
CAR
DEALERSHIP
AND
IVE
DONE
A
LOT
OF
DIFFERENT
THINGS
FOR
A
LIVING
SOME
PEOPLE
SAY
I
GOT
INTO
POLITICS
TO
ESCAPE
WORK
LAUGHTER
I
LEARNED
SOMETHING
FROM
EVERY
JOB
I
EVER
HAD
BUT
I
GREW
UP
IN
A
GENERATION
WHERE
I
LITERALLY
DID
NOT
KNOW
A
LIVING
SOUL
WITHOUT
REGARD
TO
RACE
OR
INCOME
WHO
WANTED
TO
WORK
WHO
DIDNT
HAVE
A
JOB
I
GREW
UP
IN
A
GENERATION
WHEN
ALL
YOU
HAD
TO
REALLY
SAY
TO
PEOPLE
IS
GET
AN
EDUCATION
AND
YOULL
BE
ALL
RIGHT
YOULL
GET
A
JOB
AND
YOULL
MAKE
MORE
MONEY
NEXT
YEAR
THAN
YOU
DID
THIS
YEAR
NOW
I
LIVE
IN
A
GENERATION
FULL
OF
PEOPLE
MOST
OF
WHOM
DONT
MAKE
ANY
MORE
MONEY
IN
REAL
DOLLARS
THAN
THEY
DID
YEARS
AGO
AND
THEYRE
WORKING
LONGER
HOURS
AND
THEYRE
PAYING
MORE
FOR
THE
BASICS
OF
LIFE
AND
WE
ARE
NOW
WONDERING
WHETHER
WE
CAN
CREATE
THE
JOBS
THAT
THESE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WANT
NOW
I
WANT
TO
CLOSE
BY
REEMPHASIZING
THESE
TWO
THINGS
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
KIND
OF
ECONOMIC
POLICIES
THIS
ADMINISTRATION
PURSUES
OR
HOW
MUCH
PRODUCTIVITY
INCREASES
THERE
ARE
IN
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
IF
YOUNG
AMERICANS
DONT
GET
A
GOOD
EDUCATION
DONT
LEARN
HOW
TO
WORK
AND
CANT
BE
PRODUCTIVE
THOSE
JOBS
WILL
NOT
BE
CREATED
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
MACHINES
WILL
DO
THE
WORK
OR
THE
WORK
WILL
BE
DONE
OFFSHORE
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
THE
SAME
SKILL
LEVELS
AND
CAN
WORK
FOR
A
THIRD
OR
A
FOURTH
OR
A
FIFTH
THE
WAGES
SO
NOTHING
WE
CAN
DO
ECONOMICALLY
WILL
MATTER
UNLESS
WE
BUILD
THE
SKILLS
AND
CAPACITIES
OF
AMERICAS
WORK
FORCE
AND
ANYBODY
THAT
PRETENDS
OTHERWISE
IS
JUST
KIDDING
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WE
NEED
TO
BE
HONEST
EVERY
WEALTHY
COUNTRY
IN
THE
WORLD
INCLUDING
THE
UNITED
STATES
IS
HAVING
DIFFICULTY
CREATING
JOBS
IF
I
KNEW
EVERYTHING
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
DONE
ID
BE
GLAD
TO
TELL
YOU
AND
WE
COULD
JUST
CALL
OFF
THE
WHOLE
DELIBERATIONS
OF
CONGRESS
AND
EVERYTHING
ELSE
I
DONT
HAVE
ALL
THE
ANSWERS
BUT
I
KNOW
THIS
DOING
NOTHING
IS
NOT
THE
ANSWER
APPLAUSE
AND
SO
THE
JOBS
PROGRAM
THAT
I
HAVE
PRESENTED
TO
CONGRESS
WITH
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
WITH
THE
MONEY
FOR
THE
CITIES
AND
THE
COUNTIES
THROUGH
THE
COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM
WITH
THE
INFRASTRUCTURE
MONEY
IS
A
SMALL
PART
OF
A
BIG
BUDGET
IT
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
ENGAGE
IN
AN
EXPERIMENT
TO
SEE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WITH
THE
ECONOMY
RECOVERING
IN
TERMS
OF
CORPORATE
PROFIT
WE
CAN
GIVE
A
LITTLE
BOOST
TO
IT
GIVE
OPPORTUNITIES
TO
YOUNG
PEOPLE
CREATE
A
HALF
A
MILLION
JOBS
AND
MAYBE
GET
THE
ENGINE
GOING
AGAIN
MOST
OF
THE
JOBS
IN
THIS
PROGRAM
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
JOBS
IN
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
NOT
GOVERNMENT
JOBS
EVEN
THOUGH
ITS
GOVERNMENT
MONEY
AND
THE
LIONS
SHARE
OF
THE
WORK
IN
REBUILDING
THE
AMERICAN
ECONOMY
OBVIOUSLY
WILL
COME
FROM
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
THATS
THE
KIND
OF
SYSTEM
WE
HAVE
AND
IT
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
BUT
THIS
IS
THE
CHALLENGE
WE
HAVE
SO
I
ASK
ALL
OF
YOU
HERE
TODAY
TO
SUPPORT
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
PROGRAM
TO
ASK
YOUR
FRIENDS
AND
NEIGHBORS
TO
SUPPORT
IT
TO
GO
BACK
HOME
AND
ASK
YOUR
EMPLOYERS
TO
MAKE
A
LITTLE
EXTRA
EFFORT
TO
DO
WHAT
YOU
CAN
TO
HELP
ME
PASS
THE
FUNDS
TO
CREATE
THE
JOBS
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
CREATE
THIS
SUMMER
SO
THAT
TOGETHER
WE
CAN
HAVE
THIS
PARTNERSHIP
BECAUSE
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
WE
HAVE
TO
GIVE
A
FUTURE
A
FUTURE
THAT
OUR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
CAN
BELIEVE
IN
WE
NEED
TO
SEND
THEM
A
MESSAGE
THAT
HERE
IN
AMERICA
IF
YOU
STUDY
HARD
AND
WORK
HARD
IF
YOU
OBEY
THE
LAW
AND
CONTRIBUTE
SOMETHING
TO
YOUR
COMMUNITY
YOU
WILL
BE
REWARDED
BY
YOUR
COUNTRY
YOU
CAN
BUILD
A
FUTURE
FROM
YOU
OWN
DREAMS
THAT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THE
PROMISE
OF
AMERICA
TOGETHER
THATS
WHAT
THIS
SUMMER
OF
CHALLENGE
NEEDS
TO
BE
A
REAFFIRMATION
OF
THE
PROMISE
OF
AMERICA
FOR
SO
MANY
YOUNG
PEOPLE
TO
WHOM
THAT
PROMISE
HAS
BEEN
AN
ILLUSION
WE
CAN
MAKE
IT
A
REALITY
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
