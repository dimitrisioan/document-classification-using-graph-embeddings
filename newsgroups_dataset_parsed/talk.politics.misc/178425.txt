MYTHS

PT

IN

GLDCUNIXBCCCOLUMBIAEDU
GARY
L
DARE
WRITES
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
LITIGATION
ENVIRONMENT
IS
REFLECTED
IN
THE
FEES
LACK
OF
DEFENSIVE
MEDICINE
AND
NEARABSENCE
OF
MALPRACTICE
IS
REALLY
WHY
WE
SPEND
LESS
USING
THE
MOST
EXPENSIVE
APPROACH
OF
PURE
INSURANCE
THEN
WHY
DO
WE
REALLY
NEED
NATIONAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
THEN
WOULDNT
IT
JUST
MAKE
MORE
SENSE
TO
FIND
SOME
WAY
TO
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
COST
OF
MALPRACTICE
INSURANCE
AND
MAYBE
THATS
NOT
SUCH
A
GOOD
THING
I
ALSO
READ
SOMEWHERE
THAT
IT
IS
NEXT
TO
IMPOSSIBLE
IN
CANADA
TO
LITIGATE
AGAINST
THE
HEALTH
SYSTEMCLASS
ACTION
SUITS
ARE
NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE
AND
YOU
CANT
SUE
THE
PROVINCIAL
HEALTH
OFFICIALS
AT
ALL
PART
OF
THE
DEAL
FOR
USING
THE
ALLINSURANCE
APPROACH
LIKE
THE
FRENCH
AND
GERMANS
DO
HEY
WHY
DONT
THEY
CRITICIZE
FRANCE
AND
GERMANY
IS
IT
BECAUSE
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
TAKE
FRENCH
AND
GERMAN
IN
COLLEGE
TO
MAKE
THE
ACCUSATIONS
STICK
WAS
TO
PRESERVE
THE
DOCTORS
INDEPENDANCE
SINCE
THE
PROVINCIAL
WINGS
OF
THE
CMA
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
GO
TO
BAT
WHEN
THE
FEE
SCHEDULE
HIKES
ARE
PRESENTED
THE
POLITICALLYBENT
DOCTORS
WERE
JUST
CACKLING
WHEN
THEY
REALIZED
THE
CMA
WOULD
GROW
IN
STRENGTH
RATHER
THAN
DIMINISH
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
UNOPPOSED
UNLIKE
IN
SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE
APPROACHES
LIKE
BRITAINS
NATIONAL
HEALTH
SERVICE
OH
NO
DONT
LET
THE
AMA
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
THEY
HAVE
ENOUGH
POWER
AS
IT
IS
ASK
MOST
AMERICANS
WHETHER
THEYD
LIKE
THE
DOCTORS
LOBBY
TO
GET
MORE
POWERFUL
FOR
NONLIFE
THREATENING
THINGS
MARKET
ARGUMENTS
ADEQUATELY
COVER
WHY
CERTAIN
PROCEDURES
ARE
IN
SCARCER
DEMAND
I
HAVE
MD
FRIENDS
WHO
CANT
MAKE
A
LIVING
AS
SPECIALISTS
BACK
IN
MANITOBA
NOT
DUE
TO
THE
INSURANCE
RATES
BUT
BECAUSE
THEY
WONT
GET
ENOUGH
CUSTOMERS
THE
CMA
MEDICAL
MONOPOLYS
GRIP
ON
DOCTORS
LICENCING
AS
IN
THE
US
ASIDE
SO
THEY
MUST
MOVE
TO
LARGER
PLACES
HOWEVER
THIS
DOES
NOT
REFUTE
DEBUNKING
OF
WAITING
LINES
FOR
URGENT
AND
ROUTINE
CARE
AS
HAS
BEEN
DONE
IN
THE
US
BY
CONSUMERS
REPORTS
HEALTH
POLICY
STUDIES
CITED
BY
PROF
DENNIS
E
SHEA
ON
USENET
CNN
NYT
ETC
WELL
YEAH
TELL
US
ABOUT
THE
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
MEDICAL
CENTRE
OUTSIDE
OTTAWA
THEORETICALLY
ITS
LIMITED
TO
SERVICE
PERSONNEL
BUT
SOME
STUDIES
IVE
HEARD
ABOUT
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THAT
ABOUT
HALF
THE
PATIENTS
THERE
ARE
CIVILIANS
WHO
NOT
ONLY
HAVE
CONNECTIONS
BUT
ARENT
URGENT
AT
ALL
THE
PROBLEM
IS
IN
A
SYSTEM
WHERE
HOSPITALS
ANNUAL
BUDGETS
ARE
APPROVED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
HOW
DO
YOU
KEEP
POLITICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
OUT
OF
MEDICAL
DECISIONS
I
BET
THAT
IF
YOURE
AN
MP
OR
MPP
OR
GOOD
FRIENDS
WITH
ONE
YOURE
PUT
ON
ANY
HOSPITALS
URGENT
CARE
LIST
NO
MATTER
HOW
MINOR
YOUR
PROBLEM
WHICH
IS
OK
UNLESS
YOURE
SOMEONE
WHO
GETS
BUMPED
OFF
THE
LIST
FOR
SOME
BIGSHOT
WOULDNT
NATIONAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
MEAN
THAT
AMERICANS
WHO
ARE
NOW
FULLY
INSURED
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
SETTLE
FOR
LESS
IN
CANADA
PROVINCIAL
INSURANCE
COVERS
ALL
HEALTH
COSTS
EXCEPT
DENTAL
CARE
EYEGLASSES
PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS
AMBULANCE
SERVICE
AND
PRIVATE
HOSPITAL
ROOMS
SO
MANY
CANADIANS
DO
END
UP
BUYING
SOME
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
A
POLICY
TO
COVER
ALL
OF
THESE
THINGS
RUNS
ABOUT
TO
A
MONTH
HMM
HOW
MUCH
DIFFERENCE
WOULD
IT
MAKE
IN
THE
FIGURE
OF
PERCENTAGE
OF
GNP
SPENT
ON
HEALTH
CARE
IF
DENTISTRY
AND
OPTOMETRY
WERE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
ACCOUNTING
MAYBE
CANADA
SPENDS
PROPORTIONATELY
JUST
AS
MUCH
ON
HEALTH
CARE
AS
WE
DO
OF
COURSE
THE
ONE
THING
TO
NOTE
IS
THAT
IN
THE
CANADAFRANCEGERMANY
CASE
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
OFFLOADED
THE
BASIC
COVERAGE
TO
THE
PUBLIC
SECTOR
THEY
REALIZED
THEY
WERE
KEEPING
LOWRISKHIGHPROFIT
EXTRA
INSURANCE
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
PRIVATESEMIPRIVATE
ROOMS
VS
WARD
ACCOMODATION
DENTAL
GLASSES
ETC
FOR
CORPORATE
OR
PERSONAL
BENEFITS
THEYLL
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
YOU
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
COVERED
FOR
BASIC
CARE
AT
THAT
POINT
THEY
WOULDNT
EVEN
CONSIDER
A
VOUCHER
APPROACH
TO
BROKER
THE
UNIVERSAL
COVERAGE
AND
SELL
POLICIES
TO
MAKE
UP
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
FEDERAL
GUIDELINES
AND
MARKET
STUFF
SO
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
THE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEMS
FINANCIALLY
COLLAPSE
BOB
RAE
THE
SECOND
LEAST
POPULAR
MAN
IN
ONTARIO
WARNED
ONTARIANS
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THAT
IF
THEY
DIDNT
STOP
CROSSBORDER
SHOPPING
IN
SUCH
HUGE
NUMBERS
THE
SERVICES
THEY
EXPECT
FROM
THE
PROVINCE
JUST
WONT
BE
THERE
IN
A
FEW
YEARS
FORTUNATELY
FOR
THEM
AND
LESS
FORTUNATELY
FOR
THE
RETAILERS
HERE
IN
WESTERN
NEW
YORK
THE
CANADIAN
DOLLAR
WENT
BACK
TO
A
MORE
REALISTIC
VALUE
HE
DIDNT
SAY
SO
BUT
I
KNEW
HE
MEANT
THE
OHIP
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
HIS
WARNING
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
THE
TRUTH
WOULD
THE
PRIVATE
INSURERS
TAKE
UP
THE
SLACK
THEYD
BE
UNDER
NO
OBLIGATION
TO
OF
COURSE
THEY
COULD
EVENTUALLY
MAKE
MONEY
AGAIN
BUT
IF
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
TRUE
THEYD
BE
LOATHE
TO
DO
SO
AND
OUT
OF
PRACTICE
IN
HANDLING
SUCH
BASIC
SERVICES
TOO
WOULDNT
FREE
CARE
ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE
TO
RUN
TO
THE
DOCTOR
FOR
EVERY
ACHE
AND
PAIN
PEOPLE
WHO
GET
FREE
TREATMENT
DO
GO
TO
THE
DOCTOR
AND
HOSPITAL
ABOUT
A
THIRD
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
TO
PAY
A
SHARE
OF
THEIR
MEDICAL
BILLS
STILL
CANADIANS
WHO
PAY
NOTHING
AT
THE
DOCTORS
HAVE
A
LOWER
PERPERSON
HEALTH
BILL
THAN
WE
DO
IT
IS
FREE
IN
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
DEDUCTIBLES
NOR
COPAYMENTS
TWO
THINGS
WHICH
I
ADVOCATE
TO
MAKE
THE
CANADIAN
INSURANCE
LOOK
MORE
LIKE
REAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
WHICH
ACTUALLY
IT
IS
I
KNOW
THAT
WHEN
WORKING
IN
ALBERTA
ONTARIO
AND
QUEBEC
I
WAS
AWARE
THAT
I
WAS
PAYING
FOR
HEALTH
INSURANCE
EG
IN
TORONTO
OHIP
FEES
WERE
LISTED
ON
MY
PAY
STUB
MANITOBA
DID
NOT
COLLECT
AT
PAYCHEQUE
TIME
BUT
ONLY
ANNUALLY
AT
INCOME
TAX
TIME
BUILT
INTO
THE
TAX
RATE
ONLY
FISCAL
NAIFS
WILL
PROCLAIM
THAT
ITS
FREE
ALONG
WITH
THE
CANADIAN
LEFT
FOR
THAT
IS
PART
OF
THEIR
BRAINWASHING
AGENDA
WOULD
THAT
IT
WERE
FREE
AMERICANS
WOULD
START
ANOTHER
REVOLUTION
IF
THEY
HAD
TO
PAY
TAXES
AT
CANADIAN
RATES
ISNT
THE
PRIVATE
HEALTH
INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
JUST
TOO
BIG
AND
POWERFUL
TO
KILL
DISMANTLING
THE
HEALTH
SEGMENT
OF
OUR
INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
WOULD
BE
POLITICALLY
THORNY
IN
THE
QUIET
WORDS
OF
ONE
ADVOCATE
FOR
A
NATIONAL
PLAN
SOME
FIRMS
NOW
SELL
MORE
THAN
BILLION
IN
HEALTH
INSURANCE
THEYD
PUT
UP
A
HARD
FIGHT
NOT
ONLY
HAS
THE
INDUSTRY
GROWN
EIGHTFOLD
SINCE
CANADA
SHUT
DOWN
ITS
OWN
HEALTH
INSURERS
BUT
OUR
GOVERNMENT
LEAVES
POLITICIANS
MORE
OPEN
TO
LOBBYISTS
THAN
DOES
CANADAS
PARLIAMENTARY
SYSTEM
HEALTH
INSURANCE
DOES
EXIST
IN
CANADA
AND
IN
WESTERN
EUROPE
ITS
JUST
THAT
IT
DOESNT
COVER
BASIC
CARE
YOU
CAN
OPT
OUT
IN
CANADA
AND
GERMANY
BUT
YOULL
HAVE
TO
GO
UNINSURED
AS
A
RESULT
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
TOO
FEW
OTHER
PEOPLE
THAT
DO
SO
IE
NO
MARKET
WHEN
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
REALIZED
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
THEYD
MAKE
WITHOUT
THE
RISKS
INVOLVED
IN
BASIC
INSURANCE
EG
NEUROSURGERY
VERSUS
DELUXE
AMENITIES
EG
HAVING
TO
CALL
GRANADA
TV
TO
REPLACE
A
RENTAL
SET
ON
THE
FRITZ
IN
SOMEONES
PRIVATE
HOSPITAL
ROOM
THEY
STARTED
TO
PAT
THEMSELVES
ON
THE
BACK
FOR
THEIR
SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
IN
QUEBEC
LAST
SPRING
A
CONSORTIUM
OF
PRIVATE
INSURERS
PUBLICLY
WARNED
AGAINST
ANY
THOUGHTS
OF
PRIVATIZING
ROUTINE
LOW
COST
PARTS
OF
THAT
PROVINCES
PUBLIC
HEALTH
INSURANCE
PLAN
AGAIN
I
DOUBT
AMERICANS
WOULD
LIKE
GIVING
THE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
THAT
MUCH
POWER
I
HALF
WONDER
IF
THE
CANADIAN
HEALTH
INSURERS
DIDNT
GO
ALONG
WITH
THE
PROVINCES
AND
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
YEARS
AGO
BECAUSE
THEY
KNEW
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
GOOD
CHANCE
OF
THE
PUBLIC
SYSTEM
GOING
BUST
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
AND
THEN
AFTERWARDS
THEY
COULD
CLEAN
UP
OKAY
THIS
SORT
OF
CONTRADICTS
WHAT
I
SAID
HIGHER
UP
BUT
ITS
ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY
THEYD
HAVE
AN
ADDED
BONUS
WHEN
ARGUING
AGAINST
GOVERNMENT
INVOLVEMENT
IN
THEIR
INDUSTRYAS
THEY
COULD
THEN
POINT
TO
ITS
FAILURE
INSTEAD
OF
JUST
CITING
THEORETICAL
PRINCIPLES
