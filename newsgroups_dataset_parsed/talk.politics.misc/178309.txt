secretary
riley
good
evening
and
welcome
to
all
of
you
in
the
thousands
of
communities
around
the
country
that
are
taking
part
in
this
satellite
town
meeting
for
the
month
of
april
you
know
today
is
april
in
thomas
jefferson
was
born
years
ago
i
think
thats
appropriate
to
mention
at
the
beginning
of
this
meeting
because
since
that
time
he
has
been
of
course
a
person
who
has
been
one
that
weve
all
followed
in
terms
of
our
democracy
and
the
importance
of
education
here
in
this
great
country
the
success
of
our
democracy
according
to
jefferson
really
depends
upon
the
success
of
our
educational
system
i
wonder
if
he
realizes
the
irony
of
a
federal
secretary
invoking
a
rabid
antifederalist
in
support
of
federal
education
programs
