it
should
be
noted
that
nambla
has
not
been
present
in
the
other
or
so
gay
parades
in
the
nation
while
i
view
this
as
an
isolated
event
i
am
very
troubled
by
its
reccurence
i
hope
im
not
going
to
hate
myself
for
getting
involved
in
this
discussion
but
i
felt
obliged
to
keep
things
factually
accurate
last
year
nambla
marched
in
the
pride
parades
in
boston
new
york
and
san
francisco
it
was
not
the
first
time
we
participated
in
these
parades
and
it
will
not
be
the
last
i
have
marched
with
the
nambla
contingent
in
new
york
every
year
for
more
than
a
decade
thank
you
for
correcting
the
error
in
my
post
to
the
net
this
information
came
from
a
newspaper
article
that
was
fuzzy
in
my
mind
i
can
only
wonder
if
there
have
been
similar
outcries
about
namblas
presence
in
the
parades
of
new
york
and
boston
