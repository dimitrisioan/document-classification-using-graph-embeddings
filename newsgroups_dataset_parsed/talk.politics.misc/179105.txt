can
people
please
stop
the
i
thinkknow
the
batffbi
are
completely
responsible
but
theyll
cover
it
up
so
that
the
investigation
will
show
that
koresch
is
responsible
bs
in
an
investigation
of
this
size
with
the
feds
state
and
civilians
involved
in
the
investigation
it
would
be
practially
impossible
to
cover
up
the
place
has
burned
to
the
ground
the
fbi
and
company
have
the
whole
area
cordoned
off
and
have
already
arrested
reporters
for
being
at
the
site
and
taking
pictures
all
your
going
to
get
in
terms
of
a
story
is
what
the
fbi
atf
and
the
texas
rangers
decide
to
release
and
with
republicans
like
arlen
spector
calling
for
investigations
this
isnt
going
to
be
handled
with
kid
gloves
when
the
philadephia
cops
dropped
their
bomb
on
move
and
managed
to
burn
down
an
entire
neighborhood
many
people
said
the
same
thing
dead
men
and
rubble
tell
no
tales
that
the
police
dont
want
them
to
tell
you
can
judge
the
real
political
mood
on
this
from
the
fact
that
congressperson
pat
scroder
is
a
supporter
of
the
fbis
actions
she
was
on
television
this
week
saying
that
the
cost
of
the
operation
in
waco
was
a
valid
reason
for
the
storming
and
gassing
of
the
compound
