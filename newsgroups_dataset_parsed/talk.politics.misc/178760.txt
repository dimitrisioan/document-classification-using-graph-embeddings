writes
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
possibly
because
gaybi
men
are
less
likely
to
get
married
marriage
isnt
a
requirement
for
a
couple
staying
together
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
post
if
it
was
to
show
a
mindless
obsession
with
statistics
an
incredibly
flawed
system
of
reasoning
and
a
repellent
hatemonger
agenda
then
the
purpose
was
accomplished
with
panache
a
get
a

get

yes
you
are
when
you
and
the
rest
of
the
homosexual
community
pass
laws
to
impose
your
moral
codes
on
me
by
requiring
me
to
hire
rent
to
or
otherwise
associate
with
a
homosexual
against

yes
you
are
in

until
homosexuals
stop
trying
to
impose
their
morals
on
me
