Q
MR

PRESIDENT
HAVEL
IS
HERE
FOR
THE
HOLOCAUST
MUSEUM
OPENING
AND
YOU
TOURED
THE
MUSEUM
LAST
NIGHT
ALL
THIS
FOCUS
ON
THE
HOLOCAUST
HOW
DOES
THAT
WEIGH
ON
YOUR
DECISION
MAKING
PROCESS
AS
FAR
AS
BOSNIA
IS
CONCERNED
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
I
THINK
THE
HOLOCAUST
IS
THE
MOST
EXTREME
EXAMPLE
THE
WORLD
HAS
EVER
KNOWN
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
AND
I
THINK
THAT
EVEN
IN
ITS
MORE
LIMITED
MANIFESTATIONS
ITS
AN
IDEA
THAT
SHOULD
BE
OPPOSED
YOU
COULDNT
HELP
THINKING
ABOUT
THAT
THATS
NOT
TO
COMPARE
THE
TWO
EXAMPLES
THEYRE
NOT
IDENTICAL
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
SHOULD
ALWAYS
SEEK
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
STAND
UP
AGAINST
AT
LEAST
TO
SPEAK
OUT
AGAINST
INHUMANITY
Q
SIR
HOW
CLOSE
ARE
YOU
TO
A
DECISION
ON
MORE
SANCTIONS
ON
BOSNIA
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
OF
COURSE
WEVE
GOT
THE
UN
VOTE
AMBASSADOR
ALBRIGHT
WAS
INSTRUMENTAL
IN
THE
UN
VOTE
TO
STRENGTHEN
THE
SANCTIONS
AND
THEY
ARE
QUITE
TOUGH
AND
WE
NOW
ARE
PUTTING
OUR
HEADS
AT
THE
BUSINESS
OF
IMPLEMENTING
THEM
AND
LOOKING
AT
WHAT
OTHER
OPTIONS
WE
OUGHT
TO
CONSIDER
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
ANYTHING
ELSE
TO
SAY
EXCEPT
TO
TELL
YOU
THAT
I
SPENT
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
TIME
ON
IT
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
OVER
THE
NEXT
SEVERAL
DAYS
Q
FOLLOWING
YOUR
MEETING
TODAY
SIR
ARE
YOU
ANY
CLOSER
TO
SOME
SORT
OF
US
MILITARY
PRESENCE
THERE
THE
PRESIDENT
I
HAVE
NOT
MADE
ANY
DECISIONS
Q
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
WHY
HAVE
YOU
DECIDED
TO
MEET
