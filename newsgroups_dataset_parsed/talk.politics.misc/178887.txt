actually
i
bet
you
more
gaybi
men
are
as
not
as
promiscuous
as
gay
men
because
more
of
them
could
have
the
option
of
living
a
straight
life
and
with
social
pressures
probably
would
at

try

ryan
i
proposed
this
theory
months
ago
lets
take
it
one
step
further
even
if
as
the
surveys
show
up
to
of
all
men
have
had
a
homosexual
encounter
then
there
must
cite
a
survey
other
than
the
obviously
bogus
kinsey
studies
be
an
even
larger
percentage
of
people
who
have
had
homosexual
erotic
fantasies
but
if
less
than
of
the
population
is
gay
what
can
we
say
about
these
people
who
dont
identify
as
gay
but
have
demonstrated
gay
potential
obviously
a
large
chunk
of
these
people
chose
or
more
accurately
were
forced
to
choose
by
force
of
religion
and
social
sanction
to
put
those
feelings
aside
to
be
heterosexual
obviously
cramer
and
kaldis
fall
into
this
category
i
cant
speak
for
kaldis
but
force
of
religion
and
social
sanction
played
no
part
in
my
sexual
preferences
neither
had
much
influence
on
me
as
a
