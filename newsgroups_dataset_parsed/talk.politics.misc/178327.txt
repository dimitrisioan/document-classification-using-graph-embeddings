WRITES
NOT
AT
ALL
YOU
ARE
APPARENTLY
JUST
ANOTHER
MEMBER
OF
THE
RELIGIOUS
LEFT
SHOW
ME
ALL
THESE
ENVIRONMENTAL
DISASTERS
MOST
OF
THEM
ARENT
AND
THE
NATURAL
DISASTERS
WE
HAVE
HAD
INDIVIDUALLY
FAR
OUTWEIGH
THE
MANMADE
ONES
MOST
OF
YOUR
SOCALLED
DISASTERS
LOVE
CANAL
TIMES
BEACH
TMI
ARENT
DISASTERS
AT
ALL
SO
LOOK
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
WORSHIP
TREES
OR
OWLS
OR
SNAILS
OR
WHATEVER
FINE
DO
SO
BUT
DONT
TRY
TO
PUSH
THE
SCAREDNESS
OF
YOUR
RELIGIOUS
OFF
ONTO
ME
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
SEE
ENVIRONMENTAL
DISASTERS
GO
TO
EASTERN
EUROPE
OR
SOME
PARTS
OF
THE
FSU
FORMER
SOVIET
UNION
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
NO
ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION
LAWS
AND
WERE
TRYING
TO
INCREASE
PRODUCTIVITY
AT
ANY
EXPENSE
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
POLITICAL
SYSTEMS
LUCKILY
FOR
US
SOME
OF
OUR
POLITICIANS
WITH
VISION
PASSED
SOME
ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS
THAT
ISNT
TO
SAY
THAT
THEY
SHOULDNT
BE
MODIFIED
BUT
ALL
I
EVER
HEAR
FROM
YOU
IS
THAT
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS
WERE
DREAMED
UP
BY
A
BUNCH
OF
LEFTWING
TREEHUGGERS
INTENT
ON
PUTTING
US
BACK
ON
HORSEBACK
YES
THERE
ARE
SOME
OF
THOSE
BUT
A
LOT
OF
US
SIMPLY
WANT
TO
PROCEDE
WITH
CAUTION
