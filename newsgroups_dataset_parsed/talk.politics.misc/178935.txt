I
REALLY
DONT
WANT
TO
WASTE
TIME
IN
HERE
TO
DO
BATTLE
ABOUT
THE
LEGALIZATION
OF
DRUGS
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TO
WE
CAN
GET
INTO
IT
AND
PROVE
JUST
HOW
IDIOTIC
THAT
IDEA
IS
READ
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
FUCK
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
AND
AM
NOT
EAGER
TO
MAKE
A
FOOL
OF
MYSELF
OH
YOU
FOOLISH
PERSON
I
DO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
FUCK
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
AND
WILL
GLADLY
DEMONSTRATE
FOR
SUCH
IGNORANTS
AS
YOURSELF
IF
YOU
WISH
THE
LEGALIZATION
OF
DRUGS
WILL
PROVIDE
FEW
IF
ANY
OF
THE
BENEFITS
SO
HIGHLY
TAUNTED
BY
ITS
PROPONENTS
SAFER
CHEAPER
DRUGS
ALONG
WITH
REVENUES
FROM
TAXES
ON
THOSE
DRUGS
REDUCED
CRIME
AND
REDUCED
ORGANIZED
CRIME
SPECIFICALLY
ETC
ETC
IF
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
PROVE
HOW
CLUELESS
YOU
ARE
WE
CAN
GET
INTO
WHY
AGAIN
A
LOT
OF
WASTED
POSTS
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
GROUP
WAS
INTENDED
FOR
AND
SOMETHING
EASILY
SOLVED
BY
YOU
DOING
A
LITTLE
RESEARCH
FROM
A
PRAGMATIC
STANDPOINT
THERE
CERTAINLY
IS
SOME
JUSTIFICATION
IF
IT
IS
A
VICE
PEOPLE
WILL
COMMIT
ANYWAY
SHALL
WE
CRIMINALIZE
ALCOHOL
AGAIN
IF
THE
RELEGALIZATION
FOR
ALCOHOL
WERE
DONE
FROM
MAKING
YOU
LOOK
BAD
IS
TOO
DAMN
EASY
THE
VAST
SOCIAL
AND
HISTORICAL
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
ALCOHOL
AND
OTHER
DRUGS
MAKE
THIS
COMPARISON
WORTHLESS
VICE
STATUTES
SERVE
ONLY
TO
MAKE
IT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
FOR
THE
RICH
AND
MORE
DANGEROUS
FOR
THE
POOR
AS
TIM
SO
ELOQUENTLY
PUT
IT
PEOPLE
WILL
HOWEVER
AND
SO
IT
SHALL
BE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
BY
THE
PEOPLE
DECIDES
THAT
THESE
VICES
ARE
DETRIMENTAL
TO
THE
SOCIETY
AS
A
WHOLE
AND
WHY
PRAY
TELL
IS
AIDS
VICTIM
IN
SNEAR
QUOTES
ARE
YOU
OF
THE
REVISIONIST
SORT
THAT
THINKS
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
THE
AIDS
PLAUGE
OR
DO
THEY
JUST
DESERVE
IT
THE
OVERWHELMINGLY
VAST
MAJORITY
