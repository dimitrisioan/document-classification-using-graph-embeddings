XAVIER
GALLAGHER
WRITES
TRUE
MAN
DID
NOT
INVENT
THE
NEED
FOR
FOOD
SHELTER
WARMTH
AND
THE
ILK
BUT
MAN
DID
INVENT
THE
PROPERTY
LAWS
AND
THE
LAWS
OF
TRESPASS
BUT
HOW
DO
YOU
THINK
PROPERTY
IS
GENERATED
DOES
IT
GROW
AUTOMATICALLY
ON
TREES
WHEN
WE
WISH
SO
OR
SOMEONE
HAS
TO
PRODUCE
IT
SOME
SAY
IT
WAS
GENERATED
BY
GOD
OR
GODDESS
SOME
SAY
IT
WAS
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
COALESCENCE
OF
BILLIONS
OF
TONS
OF
INTERSTELLAR
DEBRIS
IN
EITHER
CASE
THE
PROPERTY
OF
WHICH
XAVIER
SPEAKS
HAS
BEEN
AROUND
FOR
MILLIONS
OF
YEARS
IT
ALL
FOLLOWS
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
MOTHER
NATURE
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
US
AUTOMATICALLY
WITH
OUR
NEEDS
OH
WHEN
DID
SHE
STOP
MOTHER
NATURE
HAS
BEEN
AUTOMATICALLY
PROVIDING
US
WITH
HER
BOUNTY
EVER
SINCE
WE
CRAWLED
OUT
OF
THE
PRIMORDIAL
OOZE
IT
IS
NOT
PRODUCED
IT
PRODUCES
ITSELF
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR
LAST
NIGHT
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
SAW
FOUR
DEER
CROSSING
THE
ROAD
PRETTY
SIGHT
TOO
IN
AN
EARLIER
TIME
ONE
OF
THEM
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DINNER
THERE
ARE
WAYS
TO
GO
WITH
PRODUCED
THINGS
THE
FIRST
IS
TO
TRADE
IT
WITH
THE
THE
PERSONS
WHO
PRODUCED
IT
THE
OTHER
ONE
IS
TO
TAKE
IT
WITH
A
GUN
FROM
THE
PERSON
WHO
PRODUCED
IT
THE
FIRST
WAY
IS
THE
CIVILIZED
METHOD
THE
SECOND
IS
HOW
SAVAGES
ARRANGE
THEIR
AFFAIRS
THE
AMERICAN
INDIANS
HAD
NO
CONCEPT
OF
OWNERSHIP
OF
PROPERTY
AND
OFTEN
FREELY
GAVE
OF
THEIR
SUPPLIES
TO
NEIGHBORING
TRIBES
TRADING
FOOD
AND
CLOTHING
FOR
WEAPONS
OR
SERVICES
THE
NATIVE
HAWAIIANS
LIKE
THEIR
POLYNESIAN
ANCESTORS
ALSO
COULD
NOT
CONCEIVE
OF
THAT
IDEA
AND
SHARED
MANY
THINGS
WITH
THE
OTHER
ISLANDERS
IN
FACT
HIIPOI
THE
HAWAIIAN
WORD
FOR
CHERISH
MEANS
SHARING
FOOD
THE
GREAT
MAHELE
IN
WHICH
THE
ISLANDS
WERE
DIVIDED
UP
MOREORLESS
EVENLY
BETWEEN
THE
RICH
AND
THE
POOR
WAS
A
WHITE
MANS
IDEA
IN
AFRICA
VILLAGERS
WILL
OFTEN
SHARE
TOOLS
CROPS
AND
CLOTHING
WITH
OTHER
MEMBERS
OF
THEIR
OWN
VILLAGE
AND
NEIGHBORING
VILLAGES
EVERY
ANTHROPOLOGIST
WHO
HAS
EVER
BEEN
TO
AFRICA
HAS
AT
LEAST
ONE
TALE
OF
THE
DIFFICULTIES
ARISING
FROM
THE
SO
CALLED
THEFT
OF
THE
SCIENTISTS
POSSESSIONS
TWO
CONCEPTS
OF
WHICH
UNTIL
THE
VISITORS
CAME
ALONG
THE
NATIVES
HAD
NO
UNDERSTANDING
THESE
ARE
THE
PEOPLE
WE
CALL
SAVAGES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
CARJACKINGS
AND
MUGGINGS
ARE
UP
FROM
LAST
YEAR
DOV
BEFORE
YOU
MAKE
FURTHER
COMMENT
ON

I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BEHOOVE
YOU
