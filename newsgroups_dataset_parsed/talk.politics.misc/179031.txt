RE
DRUGS
AND
CRIME
A
NEW
APPROACH
MWILSONNCRATLATLANTAGANCRCOM
MARK
WILSON
WRITES
MISSING
THE
ENTIRE
POINT
OF
MY
POST
WROTE
GIVEN
THAT
THE
TRADE
IN
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
MUCH
OF
THE
CRIME
WHICH
AFFLICTS
OUR
NATION
THERE
IS
MUCH
EVIDENCE
THAT
IT
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
DRUGS
ARE
ILLEGAL
NOT
THE
DRUGS
THEMSELVES
THAT
HAVE
CAUSED
THE
VIOLENCE
WITNESS
PROHIBITION
AND
THE
VIOLENCE
THAT
SURROUNDED
THE
TRADE
IN
ALCOHOL
NO
JOKE
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
DRUGS
PARTICULARLY
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
PREDISPOSED
TO
ADDICTION
WILL
FIND
A
WAY
TO
GET
THEM
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
ARE
LEGALLY
AVAILABLE
THIS
IS
SUPPOSSED
TO
BE
AN
ARGUMENT
FOR
KEEPING
DRUGS
ILLEGAL
NOYOUJUMPED
TOTHATCONCLUSION
ITS
ACTUALLY
AN
ARGUMENT
AS
TO
HOW
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THE
SOCIETAL
GOOD
OF
DISCOURAGING
DRUG
USE
WITHOUT
VIOLATING
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHTS
DESPITE
CURRENT
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
EFFORTS
DRUGS
ARE
READILY
AVAILABLE
TO
THOSE
WHO
WANT
THEM
THIS
IS
SUPPOSSED
TO
BE
AN
ARGUMENT
FOR
KEEPING
DRUGS
ILLEGAL
NO
YOUMISSED
THE
POINT
THE
POINT
IS
THE
WAR
ON
DRUGS
IS
A
FAILURE
AND
IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
ADDICTION
TO
DRUGS
BOH
LEGAL
AND
ILLEGAL
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
A
SIGNIFICANT
DRAIN
ON
THE
PRODUCTIVE
RESOURCES
OF
OUR
COUNTRY
AND
THIS
OCCURS
IN
A
VARIETY
OF
WAYS
FROM
THE
COCAINEADDICTED
BABIES
WHO
ARE
UNABLE
TO
LEARN
TO
THE
SPREAD
OF
DISEASE
AMONG
ADDICTS
TO
THE
TRAGIC
CONSEQUENCES
OF
ALCOHOL
ABUSE
AND
TOBACCO
SMOKING
THE
CRACK
BABY
SCENARIO
HAS
BEEN
THOUROUGHLY
DISCREDITED
IT
JUST
SO
HAPPENS
THAT
THE
SYMPTOMS
SEEN
IN
THE
CRACK
BABIES
ARE
IDENTICAL
TO
FETAL
ALCOHOL
SYNDROME
AND
THE
MOTHERS
WHO
ADMITTED
TO
TAKING
CRACK
ALSO
ADMITTED
TO
DRINKING
HEAVILY
DURING
PREGNANCY
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
PEOPLE
ARE
FREE
TO
BE
STUPID
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
FREE
TO
BE
STUPID
AND
INJURE
OTHER
PEOPLE
ADMITTEDLY
THE
FETAL
RIGHTTOLIFE
IS
OUTSIDE
THE
SCOPE
OF
THIS
DISCUSSION
HOWEVER
ITS
RIDICULOUS
TO
ASSERT
AS
YOU
APPARENTLY
DO
THAT
COCAINE
HASNO
EFFECTON
THE
DEVELOPING
FETAL
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
CAFFIENE
AND
NICOTINE
HAVE
FETAL
EFFECTS
TOO
WHY
SHOULD
COCAINE
BE
ANY
EXCEPTION
A
GENERAL
ECONOMIC
PRINCIPLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
IS
THAT
WHATEVER
IS
SUBSIDIZED
YOU
GET
MORE
OF
AND
WHATEVER
IS
TAXED
YOU
GET
LESS
OF
TO
BE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
IN
CONFRONTING
THE
NATIONS
DRUG
PROBLEM
SOME
WAY
MUST
BE
FOUND
TO
UTILIZE
THESE
ADDITIONAL
POWERS
OF
GOVERNMENT
TO
MAKE
DRUG
DEALING
AND
DRUG
USE
LESS
ATTRACTIVE
SO
MAKE
THE
DRUGS
LEGAL
TAX
THEM
AND
USE
THE
TAX
MONEY
TO
FUND
A
PROGRAM
TO
TELL
PEOPLE
HOW
STUDID
DRUGS
ARE
IT
HAS
WORKED
FOR
THE
LEGAL
DRUGS
IF
YOU
HAD
READ
MY
ARTICLE
BEFORE
WRITING
YOUR
KNEEJERK
RESPONSE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
SEEN
THAT
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
ADVOCATED
WHILE
THIS
COUNTRYS
CURRENT
EFFORTS
TO
COMBAT
LEGAL
DRUGS
HAVE
SUCCEEDED
IN
SOME
RESPECTS
THERE
IS
A
GREATER
AWARENESS
OF
THE
HEALTH
CONSEQUENCES
OF
SMOKING
AND
DESIGNATEDDRIVER
PROGRAMS
HAVE
HELPED
REDUCE
DRUNK
DRIVING
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
SAME
CANNOT
BE
SAID
FOR
THE
WAR
ON
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
THERE
REMAINS
A
CORE
GROUP
OF
ILLEGAL
DRUG
USERS
WHICH
SUPPORT
INTERNATIONAL
NETWORKS
OF
SMUGGLERS
PUSHERS
GROWERS
PROCESSORS
KINGPINS
AND
GANGSTERS
THESE
NETWORKS
AND
THEIR
MARKETING
ACTIVITIES
WHICH
INCLUDE
DRIVE
BY
SHOOTINGS
CORRUPTING
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AUTHORITIES
AND
SMUGGLING
WEAPONS
ARE
DIRECTLY
OR
INDIRECTLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
A
LARGE
PROPORTION
OF
THE
CRIMES
COMMITTED
IN
OUR
COUNTRY
EVERY
DAY
EACH
AND
EVERY
ONE
OF
THESE
PROBLEMS
IS
A
DIRECT
RESULT
OF
THE
DRUG
TRADE
BEING
ILLEGAL
NO
SHIT
SHERLOCK
CLEARLY
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
AND
RISING
CRIME
ARE
LINKED
IT
TAKES
ONLY
A
MOMENTS
REFLECTION
TO
RECOGNIZE
HOW
THEY
ARE
LINKED
THE
LINK
IS
MONEY
AS
WITH
THIS
COUNTRYS
FAILED
EFFORT
TO
PROHIBIT
ALCOHOL
CONSUMPTION
A
BLACK
MARKET
HAS
BEEN
CREATED
IN
WHICH
GREEDY
LOCAL
MONOPOLIES
LIKE
THE
GANGSTERS
OF
A
BYGONE
ERA
HAVE
PROFITED
ENORMOUSLY
FROM
THEIR
ILLEGAL
TRADE
THE
VICTIMS
OF
THIS
TRADE
INCLUDE
NOT
ONLY
THE
INNOCENT
PEOPLE
UNFORTUNATE
ENOUGH
TO
BE
CAUGHT
IN
THE
CROSSFIRE
BUT
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THE
DRUG
USERS
THEMSELVES
A
GREAT
ARGUMENT
FOR
MAKING
DRUGS
LEGAL
THANK
YOU
HOW
COULD
YOU
HAVE
MISSED
THE
POINT
SO
UTTERLY
WHATHAVEYOU
BEEN
SMOKING
HERE
THEN
IS
MY
PROPOSAL
POSSESSION
AND
USE
OF
ALL
PRESENTLY
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
IS
DECRIMINALIZED
BUT
BUYING
AND
SELLING
THEM
REMAINS
ILLEGAL
POTHEADS
CAN
GROW
THEIR
OWN
MARIJUANA
AS
MANY
ALREADY
DO
TODAY
OTHER
DRUG
USERS
CAN
LEGALLY
IMPORT
THEIR
POISON
OF
CHOICE
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
PAY
THE
TARIFFS
AND
A
BARTER
ECONOMY
OF
DRUG
EXPERIMENTERS
DEVELOPS
YOUR
SOLUTION
HAS
DONE
NOTHING
TO
ELIMINATE
THE
VIOLENCE
IN
THE
DRUG
TRADE
BTW
HOW
IS
SOMEONE
GOING
TO
IMPORT
A
DRUG
IF
BUYING
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
I
THINK
YOU
NEED
TO
THINK
YOUR
SOLUTION
THROUGH
A
LITTLE
MORE
THOUROUGHLY
OBVIOUSLY
IMPORTERS
WILL
NOT
BE
BUYING
DRUGS
IN
THE
US
UNDER
US
JURISDICTION
USE
YOUR
REMAINING
BRAIN
CELLS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BARTER
ECONOMY
WHICH
SUPPLIES
THE
DRUG
USERS
THE
BLACK
MARKET
PROFITS
THAT
HAVE
SO
ENRICHED
THE
DRUG
LORDS
DWINDLE
IF
THESE
DRUGS
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
FOR
FREE
OR
NEXT
TO
NOTHING
WHY
BUY
THEM
NEVERTHELESS
THERE
WILL
BE
THOSE
WHO
WILL
SEEK
TO
SELL
THESE
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUGS
EVEN
AT
RELATIVELY
LOW
PRICES
THEREFORE
YOU
HAVE
FAILED
TO
INDICATE
HOW
THESE
DRUGS
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
FOR
FREE
OR
NEXT
TO
NOTHING
YOU
HAVE
STATED
THAT
THE
SALE
OF
THEM
IS
ILLEGAL
OK
ILL
SPELL
IT
OUT
FOR
YOU
BARTER
ECONOMY
MEANS
THAT
DRUG
USERS
WILL
BE
PERMITTED
TO
GROW
OR
SYNTHESIZE
CHEMICALLY
ANYTHING
THEY
CHOOSE
OR
TO
BUY
IT
OUTSIDE
THE
US
AND
BRING
IT
IN
IF
IT
WONT
GROW
HERE
THEY
WILL
ALSO
BE
PERMITTED
TO
TRADE
WITH
OTHER
DRUG
USERS
FOR
DRUGS
OTHER
THAN
THE
ONES
THEY
THEMSELVES
GROW
OR
MANUFACTURE
THEY
WILL
NOT
HOWEVER
BE
ABLE
TO
LEGALLY
SELL
THEIR
DRUGS
FOR
MONEY
BOTH
MANUFACTURE
AND
IMPORTATION
OF
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUGS
WILL
BE
TAXED
TO
DISCOURAGE
THEIR
USE
THIS
IS
YOUR
BRAIN
ON
DRUGS
ANY
QUESTIONS
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
ACTIVITY
IS
CONCENTRATED
ON
THOSE
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
CONTINUE
TO
BUY
AND
SELL
AND
ALSO
ON
THE
CRIMES
COMMITTED
BY
DRUG
USERS
TOO
POOR
TO
AFFORD
EVEN
LOW
PRICES
BUT
HERE
IS
WHERE
THE
STRATEGY
BEGINS
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN
THE
DRUG
DEALERS
THE
VICTIMIZERS
AND
THE
DRUG
USERS
THEIR
VICTIMS
IN
MOST
CITIES
THIS
IS
ALREADY
THE
STRATEGY
IT
HAS
ALREADY
FAILED
AND
IS
DRAGGING
THE
REST
OF
US
DOWN
WITH
IT
PARDON
ME
BUT
POSSESSIONUSE
OF
THESE
DRUGS
IS
STILL
A
CRIME
YOU
CANNOT
ANALOGIZE
THE
RATES
AT
WHICH
DRUG
USERS
WOULD
SEEK
TREATMENT
AND
THE
COMPARATIVE
EASE
WITH
WHICH
IT
COULD
BE
MADE
AVAILABLE
TODAY
WHEN
THESE
DRUGS
ARE
ILLEGAL
TO
POSSESSUSE
WITH
WHAT
IT
WOULD
BE
WERE
THEYNOTILLEGAL
TO
POSSESSUSE
DECRIMINALIZING
POSSESSION
AND
USE
MAKES
TREATMENTMUCHEASIER
DRUG
DEALERS
ARE
EXPLOITING
THE
WEAKNESSES
OF
THOSE
PERSONS
WHO
ARE
PRONE
TO
ADDICTION
AND
AS
SUCH
THE
DRUG
USERS
SHOULD
BE
LEFT
ALONE
NOT
THROWN
IN
PRISON
ALONG
WITH
THEIR
VICTIMIZERS
DRUGDEALERSARE
THE
CRIMINALS
AND
SHOULD
BE
TREATED
AS
SUCH
DRUG
ADDICTION
DOES
NOT
ABSOLVE
YOU
OF
RESPONSIBLITY
FOR
YOUR
CRIMINAL
ACTIONS
HOWEVER
UPON
ARREST
FORANYCRIMESUSPECTS
ARE
PERMITTED
TO
CHOOSE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
WILL
UNDERGO
A
DRUG
TEST
THOSE
WHO
CHOOSE
TO
COOPERATE
ARE
INFORMED
THAT
UPON
CONVICTION
FOR
THE
CRIME
THEY
ARE
ACCUSED
OF
IF
THEY
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
A
DRUG
USER
THEY
WILL
BE
INSTITUTIONALIZED
UNTIL
THEY
ARE
CLEAN
AND
ONLY
THEN
WILL
THEY
BEGIN
TO
SERVE
THEIR
SENTENCE
IF
THEY
CHOOSE
TO
COOPERATE
AND
ARE
ALREADY

THEY
CAN

WHO
CHOOSE
NOT
TO
UNDERGO
THE
DRUG
TEST
AND
ARE
CONVICTED
FACE
STIFFER
FINES
AND
SERVE
LONGER
SENTENCES
THIS
SOUNDS
A
HELL
OF
A
LOT
LIKE
SELF
INCRIMINATION
WHICH
IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
IF
DRUG
USE
IS
LEGAL
IN
YOUR
SCHEME
WHY
SHOULD
THE
PRESENCE
OF
DRUGS
IN
ANYONES
SYSTEM
INFLUENCE
THE
PENALTY
THEY
RECEIVE
MUCH
TOO
BIG
BROTHERISH
FOR
MY
TASTES
THE
DRUG
TEST
OF
AN
ARRESTED
SUSPECT
IS
VOLUNTARY
NOT
COERCED
AND
DOES
NOT
THEREFORE
CONSTITUTE
VIOLATION
OF
AMENDMENT
V
THOSE
CONVICTED
WHO
ARE
DRUG
USERS
AS
EVIDENCED
BY
THE
TEST
ARE
IN
NEED
OF
TREATMENT
FOR
THEIR
PROBLEM
INSTITUTIONALIZATION
OF
THESE
ADDDICTED
CRIMINALS
IS
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
HELP
THEM
STRAIGHTEN
OUT
IF
THEY
REFUSE
THE
TEST
AND
ARE
CONVICTED
THEIR
SENTENCE
CAN
BE
APPROPRIATELY
HARSHER
SINCE
THEY
UNLIKE
THE
ADDICT
HAVE
NO
EXCUSE
FOR
THEIR
CRIMES
INSTITUTIONALIZATION
OF
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
SERVES
SEVERAL
PURPOSES
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
AND
THIS
INCLUDES
DRUNK
ANDOR
STONED
DRIVERS
ARE
SEPARATED
FROM
THEIR
SOURCES
OF
SUPPLY
THUS
REDUCING
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
DRUG
USERS
IN
SOCIETY
AT
LARGE
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
DECREASING
THE
DEMAND
FOR
DRUGS
ON
THE
STREET
PUTTING
MORE
OF
THE
REMAINING
DRUG
DEALERS
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
WHY
SHOULD
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
BE
TREATED
ANY
DIFFERENT
FROM
OTHER
CRIMINALS
YOU
HAVE
ALREADY
STATED
THAT
DRUG
USE
IS

WHY

MY

IS
TO

BEHAVIOR
IF
FEWER
CRIMINALS
DO
DRUGS
OUT
OF
FEAR
OF
GETTING
A
HARSHER
SENTENCE
IF

WHY
IS
THAT

IF
