THOMAS
FARRELL
SAID
A
GOOD
CASE
A
FKING
GOOD
CASE
THE
DEFENSE
LAWYER
ASKED
THE
VICTIM
QUESTIONS
LIKE
WHAT
KIND
OF
SEXUAL
PERVERSIONS
DO
YOU
PARTICIPATE
IN
AND
YOU
THINK
HE
MADE
A
GOOD
CASE
SPEAKING
AS
SOMEONE
WHOS
ONLY
ABOUT
SIX
WEEKS
AND
A
TUITION
BILL
AWAY
FROM
BECOMING
AN
UNEMPLOYED

WITH

ID
REALLY
LIKE
TO
SEE
A
TRANSCRIPT
OF
THIS
TRIAL
ID
ESPECIALLY
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THE
DEFENSE
ATTORNEY
ASKED
THAT
QUESTION
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
REPORTS
THAT
HE
DID
SO
ARE
ACCURATE
IM
NOT
ACCUSING
TOM
FARRELL
OF
MAKING
ANYTHING
UP
BUT
THIS
IS
THE
SORT
OF
CASE
THAT
SPAWNS
GARBLED
MISQUOTES
FALSE
RUMORS
AND
URBAN
LEGENDS
LIKE
TRIBBLES
ITD
BE
NICE
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
PROSECUTOR
OBJECTED
IRRELEVANT
PREJUDICIAL
INFLAMMATORY
TAKE
YOUR
PICK
AND
THAT
THE
JUDGE
UPHELD
THE
OBJECTION
HAVING
WATCHED
MOST
OF
THE
TELEVISED
TRIAL
I
CAN
ANSWER
THAT
WHEN
SUCH
STATEMENTS
WERE
MADE
BY
THE
DEFENSE
ATTY
THE
PROSECUTOR
DID
OBJECT
AND
THE
JUDGE
TENDED
TO
SUSTAIN
THE
ONES
THAT
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
FALLING
UNDER
THE
SELFINCRIMINATION
TYPE
OF
OBJECTION
THERE
WAS
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
METADISCUSSION
DURING
THE
TRIAL
OVER
THE
USE
OF
GRAPHIC
LANGUAGE
WITH
MOST
FOLKS
ASKING
THE
JUDGE
IF
SHE
WANTED
TO
HEAR
THE
EXACT
LANGUAGE
PRACTICALLY
EVERY
TIME
THE
DEFENSE
TRIED
TO
GET
THE
PLAINTIFFS
TO
SELFINCRIMINATE
BY
ASKING
THEM
SUCH
QUESTIONS
THERE
WERE
OBJECTIONS
AND
SUSTAINS
AT
ONE
POINT
THE
DEFENSE
MANAGED
TO
GET
IN
A
QUIP
ABOUT
SOLICITATION
FOR
A
FELONY
AND
THE
JUDGE
HERSELF
SAID
SUSTAINED
BEFORE
THE
PROSECUTOR
