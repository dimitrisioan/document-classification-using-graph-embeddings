WRITES
QUESTIONS
LIKE
WHAT
KIND
OF
SEXUAL
PERVERSIONS
DO
YOU
PARTICIPATE
IN
AND
YOU
THINK
HE
MADE
A
GOOD
CASE
THE
ARRESTING
OFFICER
SAID
THE
BASTARDS
TOLD
HIM
THEY
DID
IT
ON
PURPOSE
AND
HOPED
THE
VICTIM
WOULD
DIE
AND
YOU
THINK
THE
DEFENSE
MADE
A
GOOD
CASE
NO
WONDER
WERE
LOSING
WERE
APARENTLY
NOT
TRYING
TO
WIN
THE
CLIP
I
SAW
WAS
EVEN
WORSE
THAN
THAT
THE
DEFENSE
ATTORNEY
WAS
ASKING
SOMETHING
LIKE
WHAT
HAVE
YOU
DONE
TO
SERVE
YOUR
COUNTRY
AS
COMPARED
TO
THESE
FINE
UPSTANDING
EXAMPLES
OF
PATRIOTISM
I
DIDNT
SEE
THE
RESPONSE
I
DONT
THINK
IT
WAS
SHOWN
ON
TV
I
WISH
THE
RESPONSE
HAD
BEEN
I
VOTE
I
PAY
TAXES
I
PAY
MY
SALARY
I
SUPPORT
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
UNLIKE
YOU
COUNSELOR
IN
MY
DREAMS
NOW
THE
REAL
QUESTION
IS
COULD
THIS
BE
A
FEDERAL
CIVIL
RIGHTS
CASE
SINCE
THE
STATE
CASE
WAS
A
SHAM
SOUND
LIKE
A
WELLKNOWN
LOS
ANGELES
TRIAL
PROBABLY
NOT
FAGS
AND
DYKES
ARENT
PROTECTED
FOR
BEING
FAGS
AND
DYKES
UNDER
CIVIL
RIGHTS
LAWS
I
WOULD
DOUBT
ANY
CIVIL
RIGHTS
CASE
WOULD
BE
IN
ORDER
FOR
THE
POINT
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
POSSIBLE
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
BAD
IDEA
SINCE
IT
SMACKS
REAL
STRONGLY
OF
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
A
CIVIL
CASE
FOR
DAMAGES
IS
FINE
SINCE
THAT
IS
A
TRIAL
THAT
WOULD
PROCEED
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
FIRST
I
THINK
A
BAD
PRECEDENT
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
SET
IN
THE
KING
TRIAL
IN
LA
AND
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
WOULD
MAKE
IT
WORSE
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
BAD
ANYBODY
FEELS
ABOUT
THIS
DECISION
IT
MUST
STAND
THAT
CHARGES
OF
ASSAULT
WERE
NOT
NOT
PROVEN
AGAINST
THE
THREE
MARINES
AND
THATS
HOW
IT
SHOULD
STAND
