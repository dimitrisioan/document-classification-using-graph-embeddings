i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
tv
stations
here
in
la
want
a
riot
to
happen
when
the
verdict
comes
in
why
is
this
surprising
then
the
times
can
get
a
few
more
pulitzers
the
same
way
they
did
last
year
i
suppose
all
media
want
something
to
happen
otherwise
what
would
they
report
thats
their
job
duhhh
to
me
but
its
not
so
much
surprising
that
they
want
a
riot
as
it
is
amazing
how
they
carry
that
desire
across
in
not
so
subtle
ways
at
least
to
me
carlos
i
as
much
as
any
other
man
am
in
favor
of
having
the
superior
position
assigned
to
the
white
race
