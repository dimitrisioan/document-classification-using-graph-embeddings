news
were
here
at
the
pittsburgh

and
with
me
is
the
president
of
the
united
states
bill
clinton
and
id
like
to
welcome
you
to
the
area
and
to
kdka
the
president
thank
you
mike
glad
to
be
here
q
there
are
a
lot
of
things
wed
like
to
talk
about
in
the
brief
amount
of
time
we
have
but
some
news
is
just
breaking
from
los
angeles
i
guess
the
entire
country
has
been
kind
of
holding
their
breath
wondering
whats
going
to
happen
in
the
trial
of
the
four
los
angeles
police
officers
we
just
heard
that
two
of
those
officers
the
sergeant
sergeant
koon
and
officer
powell
have
been
found
guilty
and
two
officers
have
been
found
not
guilty
its
a
situation
thats
been
building
for
over
a
year
since
the
first
trial
and
now
this
trial
and
this
verdict
and
i
wonder
what
your
thoughts
are
this
morning
on
how
you
see
the
situation
in
los
angeles
in
connection
with
your
administration
and
what
youre
trying
to
do
the
president
well
first
of
all
i
think
the
american
people
should
know
that
this
trial
in
my
judgment
is
a
tribute
to
the
work
and
judgment
of
the
jury
as
well
as
to
the
efforts
of
the
federal
government
in
developing
the
case
the
law
under
which
the
officers
were
tried
is
a
complex
one
the
standards
of
proof
are
complicated
the
jury
decided
that
they
would
convict
the
sergeant
who
was
responsible
for
supervising
the
officers
and
the
officer
who
on
the
film
did
most
of
the
beating
the
jury
acquitted
an
officer
who
kicked
rodney
king
but
also
plainly
tried
to
shield
him
from
some
blows
and
another
officer
who
was
a
rookie
no
one
knows
exactly
why
they
did
what
they
did
but
it
appears
that
they
really
tried
to
do
justice
here
they
acknowledged
that
his
civil
rights
were
violated
and
i
think
that
the
american
people
should
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
that
but
i
hope
now
we
can
begin
to
look
ahead
and
focus
on
three
things
first
of
all
the
importance
of
trying
to
bring
this
country
together
and
not
violate
the
civil
rights
of
any
american
secondly
the
importance
of
renewing
our
fight
against
crime
i
think
its
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
poorest
areas
of
los
angeles
and
many
other
cities
in
this
country
people
may
be
worried
about
police
abuse
but
theyre
even
more
worried
about
crime
its
time
that
we
renewed
our
efforts
to
go
to
community
policing
put
more
police
officers
on
the
street
pass
the
brady
bill
that
would
require
a
waiting
period
before
people
could
buy
a
handgun
and
do
some
other
things
to
reduce
the
vulnerability
of
our
people
to
violence
and
drugs
and
the
last
point
id
like
to
make
is
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
got
to
rededicate
ourselves
to
the
economic
revitalization
of
our
cities
and
other
economicallydistressed
areas
if
you
just
think
about
it
if
everybody
in
los
angeles
who
wanted
a
job
had
one
i
dont
think
wed
have
quite
as
many
problems
as
we
do
and
i
laid
out
a
very
ambitious
program
in
the
campaign
to
try
to
bring
private
investment
and
public
investment
to
bear
in
our
cities
i
have
dispatched
the
commerce
secretary
ron
brown
to
california
to
try
to
come
up
with
some
strategies
for
that
state
because
its
our
biggest
state
with
our
highest
unemployment
rate
which
could
then
be
applied
around
the
country
i
want
to
talk
to
him
and
to
the
attorney
general
to
the
new
head
of
the
naacp
to
reverend
jackson
and
to
several
other
people
and
then
ill
decide
where
to
go
from
here
with
regard
to
los
angeles
and
the
other
cities
of
the
country
q
lets
talk
about
what
brings
you
to
the
pittsburgh
area
today
there
have
been
i
guess
theres
been
a
lot
of
discussion
on
capitol
hill
about
your
stimulus
package
youve
been
locked
in
a
battle
with
the
gop
yesterday
as
you
said
earlier
in
your
radio
address
you
made
some
moves
to
break
that
gridlock
what
brings
you
to
pittsburgh
in
particular
to
allegheny
county
in
particular
to
pennsylvania
with
that
battle
the
president
well
there
are
two
reasons
first
of
all
pittsburgh
allegheny
county
and
pennsylvania
supported
me
in
the
last
election
because
they
wanted
a
new
direction
in
economic
policy
we
have
passed
our
overall
economic
plan
it
gives
the
country
a
very
different
budget
for
the
next
five
years
than
weve
had
in
the
previous
we
reduced
the
deficit
and
at
the
same
time
increased
investment
in
jobs
and
education
and
health
care
in
the
things
that
will
make
us
a
stronger
country
but
in
addition
to
that
i
asked
the
congress
in
the
short
run
to
spend
a
little
more
money
a
modest
amount
of
money
to
create
another
halfmillion
jobs
in
the
next
year
and
a
half
to
try
to
cut
the
unemployment
rate
by
a
half
a
percent
but
also
to
try
to
spark
job
creation
in
the
private
sector
more
the
plan
passed
the
house
it
has
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
senate
at
the
present
time
all
the
republican
senators
as
a
bloc
are
filibustering
the
bill
that
is
they
wont
let
it
come
to
a
vote
i
believe
that
senator
specter
would
like
to
vote
for
the
bill
and
i
believe
that
senator
dole
the
republican
leader
has
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
a
lot
of
the
republicans
to
stay
hitched
and
theyre
all
saying
that
this
bill
increases
the
deficit
it
doesnt
this
bill
is
well
below
the
spending
targets
that
congress
approved
including
the
republicans
for
this
year
this
bill
is
paid
for
by
budget
cuts
in
the
next
five
years
this
bill
is
designed
to
give
a
jumpstart
to
the
economy
and
i
must
say
a
lot
of
the
republican
senators
that
are
holding
it
up
when
mr
bush
was
president
voted
for
billions
of
dollars
of
emergency
spending
of
just
this
kind
much
of
it
was
totally
unrelated
to
creating
jobs
so
what
im
trying
to
do
is
to
break
this
logjam
ive
held
out
an
olive
branch
ive
offered
a
compromise
but
i
think
that
we
ought
to
try
to
put
some
more
americans
to
work
right
now
to
show
that
were
changing
the
direction
of
the
country
and
thats
the
purpose
of
the
bill
q
have
you
been
in
touch
with
senator
specter
or
his
office
lately
the
president
well
weve
been
trying
to
talk
regularly
to
through
my
white
house
congressional
liaison
operation
to
the
senators
that
we
think
are
open
to
this
senator
specter
senator
damato
from
new
york
senator
jeffords
from
vermont
senator
hatfield
from
oregon
and
five
or
six
others
whom
we
believe
know
we
need
more
jobs
in
this
economy
and
know
that
we
are
paying
for
this
with
budget
cuts
over
the
life
of
the
budget
i
presented
you
know
it
has
a
lot
of
appeal
to
say
well
weve
got
a
big
deficit
we
shouldnt
increase
it
more
but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
paying
for
this
with
budget
cuts
in
the
whole
life
of
the
budget
over
the
next
few
years
and
more
importantly
we
have
this
program
well
below
the
spending
targets
that
congress
has
already
approved
for
this
year
and
theyve
done
this
for
years
with
the
republicans
voting
for
it
many
republicans
voting
for
it
for
things
that
werent
nearly
as
important
as
putting
the
american
people
back
to
work
so
i
just
hope
that
this
doesnt
become
a
political
issue
it
ought
to
just
be
about
the
people
of
this
country
and
the
need
for
jobs
q
i
have
some
questions
from
people
who
supported
you
and
some
people
who
are
skeptical
about
your
administration
it
has
to
do
with
their
hopes
and
also
with
their
fears
a
lot
of
people
who
supported
you
and
voted
for
you
in
pennsylvania
i
think
some
of
them
are
now
saying
were
glad
we
got
him
in
the
white
house
but
now
look
at
this
incredible
process
he
has
to
go
through
look
at
these
problems
look
at
this
gridlock
and
theyre
beginning
to
wonder
is
this
going
to
work
can
you
pull
it
off
and
of
course
your
skeptics
are
saying
well
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
like
this
the
president
well
what
i
would
id
ask
people
first
of
all
to
remember
that
we
are
frankly
moving
very
fast
the
budget
resolution
that
the
congress
passed
is
the
fastest
they
have
ever
passed
a
budget
resolution
ever
in
history
setting
out
the
next
fiveyear
budget
targets
so
we
are
moving
really
rapidly
and
weve
got
them
working
on
political
reform
welfare
reform
health
care
reform
a
whole
wide
range
of
things
but
its
a
big
operation
you
cant
expect
to
turn
it
around
overnight
it
took
years
to
produce
the
conditions
which
led
to
the
victory
i
received
from
the
people
in
november
and
we
cant
turn
it
around
in
days
but
i
think
were
making
real
real
progress
i
would
urge
the
people
not
to
get
discouraged
were
not
going
to
win
every
battle
and
not
everything
is
going
to
happen
overnight
but
we
are
definitely
moving
and
changing
things
q
thank
you
very
much
the
president
of
the
united
states
bill
