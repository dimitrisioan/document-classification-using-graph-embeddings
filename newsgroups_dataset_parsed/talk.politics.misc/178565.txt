FOR
A

HOMOSEXUALS
PAID
HIGHER
INSURANCE
RATES
THAN
STRAIGHTS
AND
WITH
VERY
GOOD
REASON
UNTIL
THE
GOVERNMENT
MADE
IT
ILLEGAL
TO
DO
SO
WELL
IF
WE
GO
BY
THIS
PHILOSOPHY
HOW
MANY
CHILDREN
DO
YOU
THINK
WE
HELP
PAY
FOR
WITH
OUR
INSURANCE
PREMIUMS
CHILDREN
WHO
OBVIOUSLY
CANNOT
BE
AFFORDED
SINCE
THE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
ALL
OF
THE
PRENATAL
AND
BIRTHING
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
CHILDREN
BORN
WITH
HORRIBLE
FLAWS
WHO
COST
THE
SYSTEM
AN
ARM
AND
A
LEG
TO
BE
KEPT
ALIVE
WE
ALL
PAY
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
ALL
PART
OF
THIS
SOCIETY
AND
WE
SHOULD
TAKE
CARE
OF
ONE
ANOTHER
ODDLY
ENOUGH
DEPENDENT
COVERAGE
COSTS
A
BIT
MORE
THAN
FOR
ONE
SELF
ALONE
BUT
IF
YOU
REALLY
BELIEVE
YOUR
CLAIMS
YOU
COULD
MAKE
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
STARTING
THE
HOMOSEXUALS

INSURANCE
CO
AND
REFUSE
TO
INSURE
BREEDERS
BUT
I
SHUDDER
TO
THINK
WHAT
YOUR
PREMIUMS
WILL
BE
