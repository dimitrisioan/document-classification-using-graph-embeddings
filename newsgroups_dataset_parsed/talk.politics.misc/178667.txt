critisism
is
too
easy
what
solutions
do
people
have
that
would
have
been
better
than
what
the
fbi
had
been
doing
for
the
last
few
months
after
the
seige
began
surround
the
place
with
razor
wire
and
then
let
them
sit
do
not
have
daily
press
conferences
do
your
best
to
keep
things
out
of
the
press
as
things
get
more
and
more
miserable
inside
one
of
two
things
is
going
to
happen
people
will
start
coming
out
they
will
commit
suicide
in
mass
at
some
point
the
thing
to
remember
about
is
that
hysterical
situations
and
assults
play
into
the
hands
of
a
leader
who
has
picked
this
course
its
much
easier
to
stampede
people
into
something
like
suicide
if
there
is
gas
coming
in
and
bullets
in
the
air
let
them
be
hungry
and
miserable
for
longer
and
longer
and
it
will
probably
be
more
effective
the
possiblity
that
they
would
all
kill
themselves
at
some
point
would
not
bother
me
in
the
least
or
alter
tactics
if
people
are
going
to
take
their
own
lives
the
best
you
can
probably
do
is
prevent
yourself
from
giving
them
the
opportunity
or
an
excuse
to
do
it
if
the
fbi
and
attorney
general
vampira
really
were
concerned
with
sanitation
and
welfare
of
the
children
inside
they
would
not
have
turned
the
water
to
the
compound
off
as
a
pressure
tactic
in
the
first
place
