let
me
get
this
straight
after
a
nice
long
rant
about
how
people
need
to
take
personal
responsibility
for
their
economic
and
social
lives
all
of
a
sudden
radicals
such
as
me
i
guess
are
responsible
for
poor
peoples
lifestyles
tell
me
how
that
worksor
do
you
think
that
poor
people
are
just
too
dumb
to
think
for
themselves
there
are
many
reasons
for
the
disintegration
of
the
family
and
support
systems
in
general
among
this
nations
poor
somehow

at
the
top
of
any
sane
persons
list
you
want
to
go
after
my
generations
vaunted
cultural
revolution
for
a
lasting
change
for
the
worse
try
socalled
relevant
or

education
hey
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
how
were
we
to
know
you
needed
a
real
education
firsti
mean
we
took
that
for
granted
the
generation
were
the
most
spoiled
and
irresponsible
the
depression
had
create
mothers
and
fathers
that
were
determined
that
their
kids
would
not
want
for
anything
going
overboard
and
creating
a
nation
of
brats
consider
the
contrast
between
two
famous
events
in
july
of
apollo
and
woodstock
which
group
had
large
numbers
of
people
that
could
not
feed
themselves
and
reverted
to
the
cultural
level
of
primitives
defecation
in
public
etc
and
which
group
assembled
took
care
of
itself
and
dispersed
with
no
damage
no
deaths
no
large
numbers
of
drug
problems
wasnt
woodstock
also
called
the
biggest
parking
lot
in
history
they
rejected
society
and
went
back
to
nature
in
their
parents
cars
