THIS
COUNTRY
IS
HARDLY
RUINED
IN
FACT
IT
IS
BOOMING
COMPARED
TO
AFTER
THE
ELECTION
THIS
WHOLE
USA
HAS
GONE
TO
HELL
AND
REAGANBUSH
CAUSED
IT
IS
NOT
ONLY
LAME
PATHETIC
AND
OLD
ITS
WRONG
UNDER
REAGANBUSH
THE
ECONOMY
GREW
BY
TRILLION
DOLLARS
THIS
IS
MORE
THA
N
THE
ENTIRE
ECONOMY
OF
GERMANY
A
KIND
GENTLE
COUNTRY
IN
MANY
PEOPLES
BOOKS
WHAT
A
JOKE
DRIVE
DOWN
TO
CINCINNATI
AND
TAKE
A
LOOK
NOT
PRETTY
IS
IT
BUT
DRIVE
UP
TO
CLEVELAND
AND
IT
IS
ABOUT
TIMES
BETTER
I
FROM
TOLEDO
ORIGINALLY
BUT
THAT
PLACE
ALWAYS
AS
SUCKED
AS
LONG
AS
IVE
BEEN
ON
THE
PLANET
THINGS
WERE
MUCH
BETTER
THERE
IN
ALL
THAT
GROWTH
WENT
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
RON
AND
GEORGIES
PALS
AND
I
DIDNT
GET
A
SINGLE
DIME
OF
IT
DAMMIT
AND
NOW
IM
GONNA
BE
BLED
TO
DEATH
BY
TAX
LEECHES
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
DAMAGE
FING
GREAT
REPUBLICANS
HAVE
BEEN
TRYING
TO
PASS
A
BALANCED
BUDGET
AMENDMENT
FOR
THE
LAST
TEN
YEARS
OH
HERES
ANOTHER
THING
SEEMS
LIKE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
IN
COLUMBUS
DRIVE
OVER
TO
MARYSVILLE
AND
MAKE
JAPANESE
CARS
HM
BECAUSE
FOR
A
WHILE
THE
AMERICAN
COMPANIES
COULNT
EVEN
COMPETE
IN
THEIR
OWN
COUNTRY
WHERE
FREE
TRADE
ISNT
EVEN
AN
ISSUE
HOWEVER
EVEN
THE
AUTOMOBILE
PENDELUM
HAS
SWUNG
BACK
TO
THE
BIG
I
WONDER
HOW
MANY
AMERICANOWNED
COMPANIES
EMPLOY
THOSE
IN
CENTRAL

OTHER
THAN

STATE
UNIVERSITY
OH
I
DONT
KNOW
ITS
PROBABLY
IN
