OM
MARK
WILSON
WRITES
ON
THE
NEWS
LAST
NIGHT
CLINTON
WAS
BASHING
THE
REPUBLICANS
FOR
STONEWALLING
HIS
SO
CALLED
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
ONE
SMALL
ITEM
WITHIN
THIS
PACKAGE
WAS
GOING
TO
PAY
FOR
FREE
IMMUNIZATIONS
FOR
POOR
KIDS
IMMUNIZATIONS
FOR
CHILDREN
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
ARE
ALREADY
FREE
IF
YOU
CARE
TO
GO
HAVE
IT
DONE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
THE
COST
IT
IS
THE
IRRESPONIBLE
PARENTS
WHO
ARE
TO
STUPID
OR
TO
LAZY
TO
HAVE
IT
DONE
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
YOU
LIVE
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
NATIONAWIDE
PERHAPS
YOUR
STATE
OR
MUNICIPALITY
HAS
PUT
TOGETHER
THE
FUNDS
TO
DO
SO
BUT
IN
MY
AREA
AND
MOST
AREAS
WHERE
I
KNOW
PEOPLE
IMMUNIZATIONS
COST
NATIONWIDE
THE
IMMUNIZATION
RATE
AMONG
TODDLERS
IS
ABOUT
BUT
IT
IS
REPORTEDLY
AS
LOW
AS
IN
SOME
INNERCITY
NEIGHBORHOODS
I
BET
MORE
THAN
KIDS
LIVING
IN
SUCH
NEIGHBORHOODS
ARE
ALREADY
COVERED
BY
MEDICAID
HERE
IN
MASSACHUSSETS
WE
HAVE
HAD
A
UNIVERSAL
IMMUNIZATION
PROGRAM
THE
KIND
OF
CLINTON
SEEMS
TO
BE
PROPOSING
FOR
MANY
YEARS
TWO
DECADES
MASS
IMMUNIZATION
RATE
IS
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
OTHER
I
GUESS
SOME
PARENTS
ARE
INDEED
TOO
IGNORANT
OR
TOO
LAZY
OR
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
CARE
SORRY
TO
SHATTER
YOUR
STEREOTYPES
IN
CASE
YOU
HAVENT
NOTICED
CLINTONITES
ARE
PUSHING
A
UNIVERSAL
HEALTH
CARE
ACCESS
PROGRAM
ACCESS
HERE
MEANS
THAT
FOLKS
WHO
DO
NOT
GIVE
A
DAMN
ABOUT
IMMUNIZING
THEIR
CHILDREN
WILL
HAVE
HEALTH
CARE
SERVICES
DELIVERED
TO
THEIR
DOORSTEPS
