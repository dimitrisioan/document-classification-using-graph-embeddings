A
QUESTION
WHAT
IF
INSTEAD
OF
A
TRUE
VAT
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IMPOSED
A
SALES
TAX
OF
SAY
THE
TAX
WOULD
ONLY
BE
PAID
ON
RETAIL
SALES
THUS
NOT
BUILDING
UP
AT
ALL
LEVELS
OF
PRODUCTION
COSTS
THAT
ARE
JUST
PASSED
ON
TO
CONSUMERS
ANYWAY
AND
WOULD
ONLY
GO
TO
REDUCING
THE
DEFICIT
I
KNOW
THAT
THIS
WOULD
NEVER
HAPPEN
BUT
IT
SEEMS
A
LOT
MORE
PALETTABLE
THAN
A
VAT
CANADAS
GST
IS
COLLECTED
AS
A
SALES
TAX
AND
IS
CONSIDERED
A
VAT
FUNNILY
THE
PREVIOUS
HIDDEN
WHOLESALE
TAX
THAT
IT
REPLACES
WAS
NEVER
REFERRED
TO
AS
A
TAX
OR
PEOPLE
NEVER
PAID
MIND
TO
IT
THUS
THE
UPROAR
WHEN
IT
WAS
BROUGHT
UP
FRONT
AS
THE
GST
ONE
PARTY
HAS
ACTUALLY
CAMPAIGNED
ON
HIDING
THE
TAX
AGAIN
THE
STATED
INTENT
OF
THE
TORIES
WAS
TO
USE
THE
GST
TO
WRITE
DOWN
OUR
DEFICIT
UNFORTUNATELY
THEIR
LEGISLATION
DIDNT
INCLUDE
ANY
MECHANISM
FOR
DISBURSING
THE
COLLECTED
FUNDS
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
AND
THE
MONEY
IS
NOW
SITTING
IN
ESCROW
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IS
INVOLVED
IN
RELEASING
THE
FUNDS
BUT
ONE
DILEMNA
IS
THAT
THE
TORIES
ARE
NOT
FISCAL
CONSERVATIVES
THEMSELVES
THOUGH
WHILE
TAXING
AND
SPENDING
THEYVE
MADE
MOVES
TO
APPLY
THE
BREAKS
TO
A
RUNAWAY
LOCOMOTIVE
BY
THE
END
OF
THIS
TIME
THE
END
OF
THEIR
SECOND

WHILE
THEY
DO
HAVE
CHANCES
