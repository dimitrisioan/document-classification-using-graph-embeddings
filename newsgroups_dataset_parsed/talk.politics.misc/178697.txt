re
welcome
to
police
state
usa
in
article
writes
the
above
conveniently
ignores
the
murder
of
four
batf
agents
by
the
branch
davidians
in
an
unprovoked
ambush
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
so
you
approve
of
the
batf
launching
a
raid
complete
with
flack
jackets
men
hidden
in
horse
trailers
stun
grenades
semiauto
weapons
on
peaceful
citizens
who
would
also
accept
a
search
authoried
by
a
court
there
is
still
no
proof
that
the
branch
davidians
had
illegal
weapons
nothing
else
was
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
batf
unless
they
were
thought
to
have
a
still
or
be
smoking
untaxed
cigarettes
the
automatic
firearms
violation
is
a
tax
matter
you
dont
serve
noknock
warrants
on
someone
with
cal
mgs
it
isnt
necessary
they
cant
flush
a
machine
gun
down
a
toilet
you
know
and
it
isnt
smart
if
you
are
right
you
got
a
good
chance
of
getting
blown
away
if
you
are
wrong
you
shouldnt
have
done
it
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a
warant
on
the
place
by
ludicrously
underarmed
and
unprotected
police
the
stupidity
was
indeed
related
to
this
but
the
stupidity
may
have
been
to
attempt
to
serve
the
warrant
by
ludicrously
overarmed
overprotected
and
overconfident
gestapo
escalation
isnt
automatically
brilliant
it
was
a
tax
matter
you
cant
flush
mgs
down
the
toilet
you
dont
need
noknock
warrants
for
everything
actually
imho
nothing
justifies
them
but
that
is
another
argument
if
anyone
on
the
net
cares
to
suggest
a
sure
fire
method
of
bringing
the
murderes
of
four
police
officers
to
justice
perhaps
we
could
hear
it
there
wasnt
any
murder
of
police
officers
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
them
for
murder
perhaps
we
us
citizens
are
innocent
until
proven
guilty
there
also
wasnt
any
killing
until
the
batf
screwed
up
real
bad
