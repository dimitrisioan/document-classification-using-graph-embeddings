RECENT

HAVE
BEEN
ALL
OVER
THE

SO
HAVE
LESS
RECENT

NONE
CAN
BE
SAID
TO
HAVE
SHOWN
ANYTHING
TO
WITHIN
AN
ACCURACY
OF
OF
AS
YOU
CLAIM
HERE
THIS
STUDY
IS
FROM
THE
BATTELLE
HUMAN
AFFAIRS
RESEARCH
CENTERS
IN
SEATTLE
AND
WAS
A
HOT
TOPIC
IN
THE
NEWS
LAST
WEEK
THE
STUDY
QUESTIONED
AT
RANDOM
MEN
IN
A
FACE

FACE
INTERVIEW
THIS

A
STUDIES
BUT
A

GIVE
VERY
DIFFERENT

THE

OFTEN
BEEN
ACCUSED
OF
LACKING
A
STRONG
SCIENTIFIC
BACKBONE
DONT
BE
STUPID
THE
KINSEY
REPORT
IS
ONE
STUDY
SO
IT
CANT
BE
ALL
OVER
THE
MAP
ALL
BY
ITSELF
OTHER

INCLUDING
THE
BATTELLE
ONE
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
CRITICED
AS
