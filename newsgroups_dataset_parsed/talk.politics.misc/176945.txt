q
mr
president
what
do
you
think
of
jesse
jacksons
protest
today
the
president
i
think
its
an
informational
protest
i
think
its
fine
the
owners
put
out
a
statement
few
days
ago
which
they
say
was
the
first
step
in
you
know
efforts
to
increase
minority
ownership
and
minority
increases
in
management
i
think
we
should
im
encouraged
by
don
baylors
appointment
out
in
colorado
and
i
think
its
time
to
make
a
move
on
that
front
so
i
think
its
a
legitimate
issue
and
i
think
its
like
i
said
its
an
informational
picket
and
not
an
attempt
to
get
people
not
to
go
to
the
game
so
i
think
its
good
q
do
you
think
theyre
moving
fast
enough
the
president
well
i
think
that
it
was
a
good
first
step
and
i
think
youll
see
some
movement
now
and
i
think
its
an
issue
that
deserves
some
attention
and
theyre
obviously
going
to
give
it
some
and
i
think
that
reverend
jackson
being
out
there
will
highlight
the
issue
so
i
think
its
fine
q
mr
president
how
about
the
logjam
in
the
senate
on
the
economic
stimulus
plan
do
you
think
theyll
be
able
to
break
that
and
get
cloture
the
president
i
dont
know
were
working
at
it
i
mean
its
a
classic
there
was
an
article
in
the
paper
today
one
of
the
papers
i
saw
which
pretty
well
summed
it
up
they
said
you
know
this
is
a
its
just
a
political
power
play
in
the
senate
the
majority
does
not
rule
its
not
like
the
country
its
not
like
the
its
not
like
the
house
if
the
minority
chooses
they
can
stop
majority
rule
and
thats
what
theyre
doing
there
are
a
lot
of
republican
senators
who
have
told
people
that
they
might
vote
for
the
stimulus
program
but
theres
enormous
partisan
political
pressure
not
to
do
it
and
of
course
what
it
means
is
that
in
this
time
when
no
new
jobs
are
being
created
even
though
there
seems
to
be
an
economic
recovery
it
means
that
for
political
purposes
theyre
willing
to
deny
jobs
to
places
like
baltimore
and
dallas
and
houston
and
pittsburgh
and
philadelphia
and
portland
and
seattle
its
very
sad
i
mean
the
block
grant
program
was
designed
to
create
jobs
in
a
hurry
based
on
local
priorities
and
its
one
that
the
republicans
had
always
championed
just
about
the
only
democrat
champions
of
the
program
were
people
like
me
who
were
out
there
at
the
grassroots
level
governors
and
senators
i
just
think
its
real
sad
that
they
have
chosen
to
exert
the
minority
muscle
in
a
way
that
will
keep
americans
out
of
work
i
think
its
a
mistake
the
press
thank
you
