WRITES
ANY
GOVERNMENT
THAT
ALLOWS
TINPOT
DICTATORS
TO
SET
UP
SHOP
AND
DECLARE
A
PRIVATE
STATE
HAS
DRIFTED
INTO
ANARCHY
THERE
ARE
LAWS
TO
CONTROL
THE
OWNERSHIP
OF
GUNS
AND
THE
BATF
HAD
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELEIVE
THAT
THEY
WERE
BEING
VIOLATED
THEY
SET
OUT
TO
OBTAIN
A
LEGAL
WARRANT
AND
ATTEMPTED
TO
SERVE
IT
ONLY
TO
BE
MET
WITH
GUNFIRE
WHEN
THEY
RANG
THE
DOORBELL
THE
BATF
IN
A
LETTER
THEYVE
BEEN
SENDING
OUT
TO
PEOPLE
SAYS
BOTH
THAT
THEY
WERE
AMBUSHED
BECAUSE
THEY
LOST
THE
ELEMENT
OF
SURPRISE
AND
THAT
THEY
WENT
UP
AND
KNOCKED
ON
THE
DOOR
AND
HAD
IT
SLAMMED
IN
THEIR
FACES
IT
STRIKES
ME
AS
KIND
OF
STRANGE
TO
RELY
ON
SURPRISE
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
BY
KNOCKING
ON
THE
DOOR
PRESUMABLY
THE
BD
DID
NOT
MOUNT
A
CONTINUOUS
STATE
OF
ALERT
WITH
GUNMEN
READY
TO
FIRE
ON
PEOPLE
WHO
CASUALLY
WALKED
UP
TO
RING
THE
DOORBELL
ONCE
INSIDE
THE
BUILDING
THE
BATF
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
IN
CONTROL
TRAINED
POLICE
OFFICERS
ARE
A
MATCH
TO
ANY
BUNCH
OF
BOZOS
PLAYING
AT
SOLDIERS
HAD
THEY
EXPECTED
THE
BD
TO
BE
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
PEACEFULL
CITIZENS
WHO
WOULD
ACCEPT
A
SEARCH
AUTHORIZED
BY
A
COURT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TURNED
UP
IN
A
TANK
AND
BROKEN
THE
DOOR
DOWN
ON
DAY
ONE
PHILL
THE
BATF
WERE
IN
A
FIREFIGHT
WITH
THE
BD
FOR
FORTYFIVE
MINUTES
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTING
PEACEFUL
CITIZENS
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
SHOWN
UP
IN
LIVESTOCK
TRAILERS
AND
WOULD
HAVE
RETREATED
IMMEDIATELY
NOT
A
SMART
MOVE
UNLESS
MEANT
TO
BE
PART
OF
THE
SURPRIZE
COVER
EVEN
SO
THE
NARROW
OPENING
OF
THE
TRUCKS
SIMPLY
WAS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
A
SIDE
OPENING
TRUCK
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
BETTER
MORE
LIKE
A
COVERED
WAGGON
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTING
PEACFUL
CITIZENS
WHY
SHOW
UP
WITH
OVER
A
HUNDRED
OFFICERS
SOME
OF
WHICH
CLEARLY
VISIBLE
ON
VIDEO
TO
BE
CARRYING
SUBMACHINEGUNS
AND
NATIONAL
GUARD
HELICOPTERS
SOUNDS
JUST
ABOUT
RIGHT
TO
ME
ITS
THE
MINIMUM
AMOUNT
OF
FORCE
THAT
I
WOULD
CONSIDER
NECESSARY
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
ON
THE
TALKPOLITICSGUNS
ANNUAL
DINNER
MICHAEL
HESSELTINE
ORDERED
THE
USE
OF

INCLUDING
MEMBERS
OF
THE
PARACHUTE
REGIMENT
TO
REMOVE
APPROX
HIPPY
PEACE
PROTESTORS
ON
A
SITE
WHERE
THEY
WANTED
TO
INSTALL
CRUISE
MISSILES
HE
EVEN
TURNED
UP
IN
A
FLACK
JACKET
TO
MONITOR
THE
PROCEEDINGS
JUST
ABOUT
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
TOOL
THE
WOMEN
POSSESED
WAS
A
TIN
OPENER
THAT
SINGLE
ACTION
PROBABLY
COST
HIM
THE
POSITION
AS
PRIME
MINISTER
ONE
OF
THE
ELDERS
OF
MY
CHURCH
GOT
ARRESTED
IN
THAT
HEROIC
ACTION
BY
THE
FORCES

AFTER
WAS
SOMETHING
OF
