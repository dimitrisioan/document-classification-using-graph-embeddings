next
station
the
real
question

la
chrysler
so
that
important
manufacturing
jobs
wouldnt
be
lost
you
have
just
reminded
me
of
an
old
tom
paxton
song
im
changing
my
name
to
chrysler
tom
paxton
oh
the
price
of
gold
is
rising
out
of
sight
and
the
dollar
is
in
sorry
shape
tonight
what
the
dollar
used
to
get
us
now
wont
buy
a
head
of
lettus
no
the
economic
forecast
isnt
right
but
amidst
the
clouds
i
spot
a
shining
ray
i
caneven
glimpse
a
new
and
better
way
and
ive
devised
a
plan
of
action
worked
it
down
to
the
last
fraction
and
im
going
into
action
here
today
chorus
i
am
changing
my
name
to
chrysler
i
am
going
down
to
washington
dc
i
will
tell
some
power
broker
what
they
did
for
iacoca
will
be
perfectly
acceptable
to
me
i
am
changing
my
name
to
chrysler
i
am
heading
for
that
great
receiving
line
so
when
they
hand
a
million
grand
out
ill
be
standing
with
my
hand
out
yes
sir
ill
get
mine
when
my
creditors
are
screaming
for
their
dough
ill
be
proud
to
tell
them
all
where
they
can
go
they
wony
have
to
scream
and
holler
theyll
all
be
paid
to
the
last
dollar
where
the
endless
streams
of
money
seam
to
flow
ill
be
glad
to
tell
them
all
what
they
can
do
its
just
a
matter
of
a
simple
form
or
two
its
not
renumeration
its
a
liberal
education
aint
you
kind
of
glad
that
im
in
debt
to
you
chorus
since
the
first
first
amphibians
crawled
out
of
the
slime
weve
been
struggling
in
an
unrelenting
climb
we
were
hardly
up
and
walking
before
money
started
talking
and
its
sad
failure
is
an
awful
crime
its
been
that
way
for
a
millennium
or
two
but
now
it
seems
theres
a
different
point
of
view
if
youre
a
corporate
titanic
and
your
failure
is
gigantic
down
in
congress
there
is
a
safety
net
for
you
chorus
perhaps
steven
jobs
should
take
paxtons
advice
and
change
his
name
to
chrysler
or
perhaps
set
himself
up
as
an
sl
maybe
neil
bush
could
give
him
a
hand
akasacoualfredccscarletonca
no
eternal
reward
will
forgive
us
now
for
wasting
the
dawn
jmorrison
the
opinions
expressed
above
are
mine
like
anyone
else
would
admit
to
them
