i
heard
about
a
guy
in
alberta
who
came
down
with
some
rare
eye
disease
that
he
had
to
take
repeated
trips
to
seattle
to
get
treated
well
what
american
private
insurance
plans
cover
travel
expenses
well
it
wasnt
just
the
travel
expenses
it
was
the
whole
treatment
when
you
buy
insurance
where
you
live
it
is
based
on
the
local
rates
tourists
coming
from
say
utah
will
find
that
there
is
a
difference
in
what
their
insurance
will
cover
fob
provo
and
what
they
get
stuck
with
at
lenox
hill
or
mount
sinai
if
they
fall
ill
in
the
big
apple
but
to
what
extent
does
it
affect
the
system
and
why
is
an
urgent
care
list
necessary
in
the
first
place
its
worth
thinking
about
its
regular
practice
in
a
hospital
to
figure
out
who
needs
to
get
at
what
facilities
dont
americans
have
to
arrange
in
advance
for
operations
too
i
think
that
there
are
two
standards
being
applied
here
and
that
canada
cant
give
beverly
hillsstyle
treatment
to
everybody
its
not
a
big
brother
list
its
more
like
calling
around
town
for
a
table
for
dinner
but
americans
need
far
less
advance
time
to
book
operations
it
would
depend
on
where
you
live
downtown
toronto
or
mile
british
columbia
just
like
cheyenne
wy
vs
boston
ma
again
geography
rears
its
ugly
head
since
our
health
care
providers
are
private
they
depend
on
an
adequate
market
size
in
order
to
sustain
enough
business
since
our
health
care
professionals
have
equivalent
takehome
pay
to
their
american
cousins
its
not
that
theyre
being
paid
too
little
to
provide
services
whether
canadians
would
be
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
their
own
health
services
catering
toward
americans
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
than
they
do
is
another
issue
entirely
it
must
be
noted
that
they
said
they
were
doing
it
partly
because
their
grants
from
the
province
were
getting
smaller
if
those
grants
are
so
insubstantial
why
the
need
to
attract
foreigners
to
make
up
the
difference
you
answered
the
question
yourself
private
nonprofit
foundations
have
to
make
money
somehow
and
i
think
that
its
about
time
that
they
acted
like
the
private
hospitals
that
they
are
personally
im
fed
up
with
canadian
socialists
trying
to
tell
everyone
that
their
health
care
is
free
when
we
are
actually
buying
insurance
thats
one
at
you
bob
rae
true
but
i
was
thinkingdoescan
anybody
compete
with
the
provinces
to
offer
basic
health
coverage
i
remember
reading
that
that
sort
of
private
health
insurance
is
actually
illegal
in
canada
i
have
only
hear
americans
say
that
its
illegal
but
i
could
be
wrong
just
have
never
heard
it
from
a
canadian
source
our
private
insurance
has
recently
balked
in
quebec
when
the
liberals
proposed
privatizing
some
aspects
of
routine
care
also
our
insurance
was
put
in
place
when
no
ndp
labour
governments
were
in
power
in
any
province
to
derail
the
effort
cos
they
wanted
real
socialized
medicine
youre
not
buying
insurance
so
much
as
being
coerced
into
one
insurance
plan
no
it
is
optional
as
it
is
optional
for
doctors
to
accept
it
there
are
isolated
religeous
communities
in
particular
that
ask
for
exemptions
and
one
email
from
a
christian
scientist
in
edmonton
verified
for
me
that
it
is
indeed
negative
option
i
guess
that
you
can
argue
that
there
is
a
right
to
having
a
particular
insurance
but
so
far
ive
not
come
across
that
up
north
and
i
take
pains
to
keep
tabs
with
news
from
home
and
that
turns
the
private
insurers
offering
the
frills
into
an
effective
cartelthey
dont
really
need
to
compete
because
as
you
put
it
theyre
in
a
winwin
situation
and
theyre
guaranteed
to
turn
a
profit
believe
me
they
probably
had
orgasms
when
they
figured
that
out
and
according
to
my
sister
the
yuppie
they
pat
themselves
on
the
back
to
the
point
of
ungraciousness
at
chamber
of
commerce
luncheons
interesting
side
notehave
any
new
insurance
companies
started
upfrom
scratchsince
medicare
became
standard
in
canada
i
actually
have
doubts
that
any
new
ones
have
emerged
since
ww
i
no
scratch
that
there
are
a
few
in
western
canada
and
quite
a
few
in
quebec
as
part
of
the
quebec
miracle
out
with
the
nationalism
in
with
the
french
capitalism
la
groupe
des
cooper
antes
built
a
new
tower
by
the
eatons

at

terraces
and
if
you
were
able
to
catch

crimetime
youd
see
it
as
the
welllit
one
with
doubleturrets
at
the
top
as
for
ontario
which
still
dominates
and
anchors
business
up
north
canada
is
a
very
oldmoney
kind
of
place
and
the
free
trade
agreement
saw
a
lot
of
odd
alliances
labour
unions
and
establishment
old
money
who
wanted
to
preserve
their
traditional
monopolies
on
one
side
and
entrepreneurs
and
internationally
oriented
businesses
and
professionals
on
the
other
the
final
trudeau
administration
and
the
first
mulroney
government
had
a
high
percentage
of
nouveaux
riches
who
knew
what
it
was
like
to
make
your
own
money
and
that
motivated
the
mcdonald
commission
under
trudeau
which
set
up
brians
initiative
macaroni
was
against
free
trade
til
he
did
a
head
count
of
his
caucus
after
the
election
its
not
really
insurance
if
you
dont
have
alternatives
well
you
have
to
realize
that
in
our
society
thats
like
saying
that
its
not
really
national
defence
because
you
cant
hire
your
own
rambo
squad
instead
or
even
opting
out
as
a
pacifist
btw
there
are
always
pacifists
in
the
news
arguing
about
their
portion
of
taxes
but
never
people
arguing
over
health
insurance
alternatives
and
were
talking
about
a
press
that
is
hostile
to
whomever
is
in
government
regardless
of
party
one
of
their
few
redeeming
characteristics
it
seems
also
in
the
april
globe
and
mail
there
was
a
letter
from
the
director
of
trauma
services
at
st
michaels
hospital
in
toronto
responding
to
an
article
on
a
study
comparing
heart
surgery
in
california
and
canada
in
which
some
canadian
doctor
worried
that
american
analysts
would
seize
on
the
results
as
proof
that
canada
rationed
vital
services
the
doctor
i
cant
recall
his
name
said
that
canada
is
rationing
vital
services
as
any
physician
can
plainly
see
he
said
that
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
different
from
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
the
government
cant
afford
it
as
a
result
of
deliberate
underfunding
of
the
health
insurance
plan
in
fairness
he
did
say
that
both
the
us
and
canadian
systems
are
in
the
same
situation
the
only
way
to
hit
at
the
canadian
system
is
transient
periods
of
high
demand
which
is
more
a
function
of
the
doctors
monopolys
tight
fist
on
the
licencing
an
obvious
difference
is
that
in
such
a
transient
period
the
rationing
is
of
the
nature
of
a
mob
battling
over
cabbage
patch
dollstm
as
weve
seen
recently
as
opposed
by
rationing
by
ability
to
pay
but
the
former
is
a
transient
situation
and
if
a
large
body
of
insured
patients
were
to
deluge
the
california
health
infrastructure
the
same
would
result
rationing
among
the
insured
population
with
smaller
markets
there
is
much
less
flexibility
when
dealing
with
our
insured
population
than
california
which
by
the
way
has
more
people
than
canada
in
a
much
more
dense
area
so
he
is
correct
in
that
the
resources
are
fixed
for
a
particular
time
window
or
as
a
function
of
the
doctors
monopoly
licencing
according
to
the
market
steady
state
in
either
case
as
for
being
refused
treatment
the
government
of
the
day
would
be
shredded
to
tatters
if
something
like
that
were
to
happen
canadians
can
be
geographically
bad
too
not
realizing
that
their
health
care
is
private
while
only
their
insurance
isnt
too
many
people
have
bought
into
socialist
trype
that
we
have
socialized
medicine
i
know
i
know
the
monopoly
power
of
canadian
doctors
often
leads
them
to
overstate
the
problems
with
the
system
in
order
to
get
more
money
from
the
government
another
case
of
businessmen
once
scratched
becoming
socialists
right
as
ive
pointed
out
above
but
hasnt
that
just
shifted
the
locus
of
the
problem
from
one
place
to
the
other
it
hasnt
really
solved
it
either
way
the
transient
situations
are
hard
to
deal
with
since
the
changes
in
the
private
medical
care
resource
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
ability
of
people
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disasters
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
disease
a
doctor
needs
years
of
training
plus
internship
and
specialty
training
people
too
often
tend
to
put
prescription
cold
medicine
on
their
insurance
when
they
really
dont
need
to
thats
why
ive
argued
for
deductible
and
copayments
rather
than
education
which
is
what
most
canadian
fiscal
conservatives
are
arguing
for
the
leftists
ah
just
let
em
spend
yeah
right
also
note
that
only
a
few
provinces
cover
prescriptions
under
some
high
dollar
threshold
in
most
its
your
private
insurance
that
covers
it
just
like
in
the
us
still
it
all
adds
up
in
the
oecd
measures
in
fact
buffalo
may
be
the
only
place
in
the
us
where
people
get
don
cherry
jokes
we
get
the
sabres
feed
as
a
replacement
game
on
espn
tonight
the
devils
local
metro
ny
coverage
supplants
the
main
espn
game
the
ndp
cleaning
up
a
tory
spending
mess
and
just
when
i
thought
i
understood
canadian
politics
yeah
its
a
sad
story
and
saskatchewan
tory
leader
grant
devine
has
been
on
a
nonstop
pr
campaign
to
save
his
sorry
butt
the
sask
ndp
have
taken
a
neoconservative
turn
like
hawke
gonzalez
and
mitterand
did
has
anybody
considered
following
singapores
example
and
going
to
a
system
where
the
company
and
the
state
buys
basic
and
catastrophic
coverage
for
everybody
and
then
you
also
have
an
ira
sort
of
thing
to
which
you
and
your
employer
can
can
contribute
for
medical
expenses
only
it
would
tend
to
discourage
you
from
overusing
it
the
medical
ira
would
have
limited
use
as
youd
need
a
lower
catastrophic
threshold
else
thered
still
be
a
drain
on
the
public
purse
if
someone
exhausts
their
ira
also
singapore
has
a
much
more
autocratic
mentality
which
has
seaped
down
into
its
masses
if
singaporeans
that
ive
met
are
any
indication
i
dont
mean
any
disprespect
here
where
theyd
let
you
just
die
one
of
the
good
things
about
being
the
last
country
to
create
a
national
health
care
system
should
we
decide
to
is
that
we
have
everybody
elses
mistakes
to
learn
from
thats
true
the
question
is
how
much
leeway
is
there
between
the
us
approach
and
the
secondmost
capitalist
approaches
of
canada
france
and
germany
seriously
there
are
few
areas
that
have
sufficient
population
for
a
twomoretiered
system
like
what
the
french
have
a
health
policy
prof
dg
shea
has
cited
studies
in
the
nejm
that
indicate
having
a
population
of
is
necessary
for
adequate
competition
and
in
canada
there
are
only
four
cities
west
of
the
great
lakes
with
that
population
or
larger
but
there
are
many
cities
in
the
us
with
that
kind
of
population
yes
many
and
pretty
close
to
a
lot
of
smaller
towns
or
not
too
far
from
a
bigger
town
just
take
a
look
at
a
detailed
atlas
or
better
take
a
flight
from
pittsburgh
or
rochester
to
toronto
my
first
time
across
lake
ontario
to
nyc
i
was
amazed
by
the
increase
in
density
and
the
toronto
region
is
the
densest
in
all
of
canada
there
was
one
about
a
group
of
doctors
in
calgary
who
have
opened
canadas
first
usstyle
mri
clinic
as
an
alternative
to
the
provincially
owned
one
its
about
time
ive
ragged
on
my
own
doctor
friends
as
to
why
they
dont
invest
in
their
own
private
practices
in
the
end
its
their
money
but
they
choose
to
spend
it
on
americas
cup
pipedreams
and
thats
none
of
my
business
as
for
provincially
owned
for
sure
its
against
the
law
in
canada
for
governments
to
be
directly
involved
in
the
provision
of
health
care
except
in
the
military
or
native
reser
vations
what
that
term
actually
means
is
that
the
facility
gets
by
on
public
grants
to
meet
shortfall
from
lack
of
use
no
kidding
medical
practice
itself
is
much
more
conservative
up
north
my
own
best
friend
did
two
clerkships
at
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochester
mn
and
is
no
stranger
to
high
tech
medicine
but
his
boat
comes
first
there
were
some
people
expressing
concern
that
it
was
the
first
wedge
of
twotiered
health
care
and
that
it
might
violate
the
canada
health
act
no
its
probably
socialist
whiners
who
are
offended
that
we
have
private
practices
and
always
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyways
so
why
not
have
a
particular
facility
the
canadian
big
government
mentality
often
imagines
government
where
it
does
not
even
exist
since
the
french
and
germans
have
become
more
entrepreneurial
and
less
laidback
without
sacrificing
their
culture
and
values
then
canadians
can
do
the
same
as
ive
pointed
out
above
the
law
states
that
it
is
illegal
for
the
government
to
provide
any
health
services
except
for
the
military
and
natives
look
nobody
stopped
the
clinic
when
they
planned
on
the
mri
nobody
stopped
them
when
they
bought
it
nobody
seems
to
be
stopping
them
from
using
it
either
much
ado
about
nothing
thank
goodness
that
hockey
playoffs
have
started
while
it
seemed
currently
unjustified
there
was
one
anecdote
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstrate
the
mri
he
showed
an
image
of
an
injured
knee
which
happened
to
belong
to
the
manager
of
the
bank
who
approved
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provincial
mri
then
another
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscles
would
have
atrophied
and
rehabilitation
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tiers
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exaggeration
somewhere
because
the
gao
study
of
canada
cited
often
on
usenet
did
not
find
access
to
mri
to
be
a
problem
ill
bet
the
doctor
is
relying
on
people
having
listened
to
american
trash
talk
on
cable
so
that
he
can
puff
his
chest
a
bit
there
are
already
a
few
treatment
regimens
for
knee
injuries
without
relying
on
mri
unfortunately
ive
had
a
few
and
im
not
a
banker
