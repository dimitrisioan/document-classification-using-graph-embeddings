writes
but
this
does
not
imply
that
all
relationships
between
youth
and
adults
are
exploitative
and
abusive
the
critical
factor
here
is
whether
the
sexual
activity
is
forced
or
whether
it
is
an
activity
that
is
consensually
agreed
upon
and
freely
engaged
in
by
the
people
involved
when
a
child
is
forced
there
is
often
damage
on
the
other
hand
wholeheartedly
agree
here
consensual
relationships
are
often
found
to
be
positive
experiences
for
all
concerned
why
do
i
find
this
hard
to
believe
care
to
convince
us
carlos
why
not
check
out
some
of
the
scientific
research
that
has
been
done
in
this
area
and
convince
yourself
research
around
the
world
indicates
that
the
issue
of
coercion
is
the
critical
factor
for
those
interested
in
research
on
the
topic
i
can
suggest
li

constantine
united
states

sandfort
the

i
especially
like
sandforts
research
for
he
actually
quotes
what
the
boys
who
are
involved
in
the
relationships
have
to
say
children

sex
