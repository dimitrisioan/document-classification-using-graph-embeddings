LABOR
IS
A
TOUGH
ONE
LABOR
IS
DEFINED
ECONOMICALLY
AS
THE
EFFORTS
BOTH
MENTAL
AND
PHYSICAL
OF
HUMANS
CAPITAL
IS
DEFINED
AS
INTERMEDIATE
GOODS
USED
TO
CREATE
OTHER
GOODS
AND
SERVICES
NOW
IF
A
SLAVE
IS
CONSIDERED
AN
INTERMEDIATE
GOOD
THEN
THE
SLAVE
HAS
NOW
BEEN
DEHUMANIZED
AND
IS
SIMPLY
A
MACHINE
NOT
GOOD
FOR
THE
ANTISLAVE
IE
PROHUMAN
RIGHTS
ARGUMENT
SO
SLAVES
ARE
HUMANS
AND
THEY
PRODUCE
LABOR
SORRY
THE
QUESTION
OF
DEFINING
SLAVE
LABOR
IS
NO
TOUGHER
THAN
DEFINING
THE
LABOR
OF
A
HORSE
AN
OX
OR
ANY
OTHER
LIVESTOCK
BOTH
LEGALLY
AND
ECONOMICALLY
IN
A
SLAVEECONOMY
SLAVES
ARE
NOT
HUMANS
THEY
ARE
LIVESTOCK
CAN
YOU
PROVIDE
SOME
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
SLAVE
STATES
REGARDED
SLAVES
AS
NOT
HUMANS
THEY
WERE
OUTSIDE
OUR
SOCIETY
AND
SIMILAR
PHRASES
THAT
BASICALLY
MEANT
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
RECOGNIZED
AS
HAVING
THE
SAME
RIGHTS
AS
A
FREE
PERSON
BUT
THEY
WERE
NEVER
CONSIDERED
NOT
HUMAN
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
LIKE
A
HORSE
THAT
PULLS
A
PLOW
A
SLAVES
LABOR
IS
THE
RETURN
ON
THE
CAPITAL
REQUIRED
TO
PURCHASE
AND
FEED
HIM
THE
PARALLEL
IS
SO
OBVIOUS
IM
NOT
SURE
HOW
YOU
MISSED
IT
AFTER
ALL
ITS
WAS
THE
LIBERTY
TO
USE
THEIR
PROPERTY
AS
THEY
SAW
FIT
THAT
MOTIVATED
SOUTHERN
PLANTERS
TO
EMPHASIZE
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
STATES
RIGHTS
IF
THAT
WERE
THE
CASE
THE
SLAVE
STATES
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
PASSED
SO
MANY
LAWS
THAT
RESTRICTED
THE
FREEDOM
OF
SLAVE
OWNERS
TO
DO
AS
THEY
WISHED

THEIR
