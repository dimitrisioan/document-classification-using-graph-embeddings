DOUG
HOLTSINGER
WRITES
JANET
RENO
KILLED
THE
WACO
CHILDREN
SHE
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
DEATHS
SHE
SHOULD
RESIGN
IMMEDIATELY
I
AGREE
SHE
SHOULD
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
A
MADMAN
WHO
WOULD
DO
ANYTHING
AGAINST
THE
CHILDREN
IF
HE
BECAME
PROVOKED
ALL
THE
WARNING
SIGNS
WERE
THERE
AND
SHE
IGNORED
THEM
SHE
PROVOKED
KORESH
INTO
KILLING
THE
CHILDREN
I
THINK
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
THAT
MRS
RENO
STRIKES
ME
AFTER
WATCHING
NIGHTLINE
LAST
NIGHT
AS
A
PERSON
WHO
IS
INCAPABLE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
OR
DEALING
WITH
A
GREAT
NUMBER
OF
THINGS
FACT
IS
THAT
BILL
AND
HILLARY
HAD
TO
CLEAR
THE
DECKS
FOR
THEIR
DREAM
PACKAGE
OF
FREE
STUFF
FOR
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
THEIR
SUBJECTS
THEY
COULDNT
HAVE
A
WILD
CARD
FLOATING
AROUND
WHILE
THEY
AND
ROBERT
THE
FIFTH
REICH
REICH
PLAN
THE
GLORIOUS
PEOPLES
DEMOCRACY
THAT
WOULDNT
FIT
IN
WITH
THEIR
VISION
OF
THEMSELVES
OR
WHATYOU
SHOULD
BE
PROGRESSIVELY
WORKING
FOR
AFTER
ALL
WHO
DO
YOU
THINK
YOURE
WORKING
FOR
AND
IF
A
HANDFUL
OF
PEASANT
CHILDREN
HAVE
TO
DIE
FOR
THE
GLORIOUS
VISION
OF
THE
YEAR
OF
THE
CHILD
IN
AMERICA
ITS
A
SMALL
PRICE
TO
PAY
LET
THEM
EAT
CAKE
