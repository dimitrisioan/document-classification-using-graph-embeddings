THE
LESSONS

NAZIS
RE
DAVID
IRVING
SCHOLASTIC
FRAUD
IN
RESPONDING
TO
THE
POST
BELOW
I
HAVE
CONSIDERED
ISSUES
FAR
OUTSIDE
THE
SCOPE
OF
REVISIONISM
AND
PRINCIPALLY
HAVE
CONSIDERED
THE
POLITICAL
IMPLICATIONS
OF
A
RACIST
IDEOLOGY
AND
ITS
INEVITABLE
OUTCOME
THUS
IT
IS
TANGENTIALLY
RELEVANT
TO
SOCHISTORY
AND
ALTREVISIONISM
BUT
I
HAVE
DIRECTED
FOLLOWUPS
TO
TPM
SINCE
IT
IS
PRINCIPALLY
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
POLITICAL
LESSONS
TO
BE
DRAWN
FROM
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
NAZI
PARTY
THAT
I
DEAL

AND

HARVARD
UNIVERSITY
PRESS
THE
NADIR
IN
HITLEROLOGY
IS
REACHED
BY
DAVID
IRVINGS
HITLERS
AN
AMATEUR
HISTORIAN
WHOSE
REPUTATION
AS
A
GERMAN
APOLOGIST
AND
AS
A
WRITER
WITHOUT
REGARD
FOR
ACCURACY
OR
TRUTH
WON
HIM
A
MEASURE
OF
NOTORIETY
IRVING
PRODUCED
A
WORK
INTENDED
TO
SHOW
THAT
HITLER
WAS
KIND
TO
HIS
ANIMALS
AND
TO
HIS
SECRETARIES
THAT
HE
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
WEAKEST
LEADER
GERMANY
HAS
KNOWN
IN
THIS
CENTURY
AND
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
MURDER
THE
JEWS
OR
EVEN
WISH
TO
DO
SO
BUT
THAT
THE
MURDER
WAS
COMMITTED
BEHIND
HIS
BACK
WITHOUT
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
OR
CONSENT
LET
US
ASSUME
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
THAT
THIS
WAS
INDEED
THE
CASE
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
HILTER
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
IN
ANY
WAY
LESS
GUILTY
OF
MASS
MURDER
BECAUSE
HE
AQUIESCED
RATHER
THAN
PARTICIPATED
AS
AN
ACTIVE
AND
ARDENT
SUPPORTER
ONE
OF
THE
IMPORTANT
THINGS
TO
REALISE
ABOUT
THE
NAZIS
IS
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
WAS
FAR
MORE
EVIL
THAN
ANY
SINGLE
MEMBER
ONCE
CREATED
THE
NAZI
PARTY
ITSELF
WAS
A
MURDER
MACHINE
THAT
WOULD
INEVITABLY
COMMIT
GENOCIDE
THERE
WAS
NOONE
WITHIN
IT
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
PREVENT
IT
REMEMBER
THAT
HITLER
DID
NOT
ORIGINALY
LEAD
THE
NAZI
PARTY
NOR
WAS
HE
PARTICULARLY
POWERFUL
WITHIN
IT
UNTIL
HIS
ORATORY
ALLOWED
THE
PARTY
TO
COME
TO
POWER
HAD
HITLER
RENEGED
UPON
THE
EMOTIAONAL
EXPECTATIONS
WHICH
HE
HAD
CREATED
WITHIN
THE
RANKS
OF
HIS
SUPPORTERS
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
REPLACED
AS
HE
HAD
HIMSELF
REPLACED
THE
OLD
GUARD
WHO
HE
BELEIVED
WERE
UNABLE
TO
GRASP
THE
INTELLECTUAL
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THEIR
RHETORIC
THIS
IS
WHY
ALL
PARTIES
THAT
ESPOUSE
NAZI
STYLE
RACE
SUPREMACY
IDEOLOGIES
MUST
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
DANGEROUS
AND
AS
EVIL
AS
THE
NAZIS
THE
IDEA
THAT
ONE
RACE
OF
PEOPLE
IS
INHERENTLY
SUPERIOR
TO
ANOTHER
AND
THAT
THE
GREATEST
GOAL
OF
HUMANITY
IS
TO
ACHIEVE
RACIAL
PERFECTION
HAS
ONLY
ONE
LOGICAL
OUTCOME
THE
GAS
CHAMBERS
OF
AUSCHWITZ
THE
NAZI
PARTY
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
THE
TALE
OF
A
SUPREMELY
EVIL
SINGLE
MAN
WHO
LEAD
AN
ENTIRE
COUNTRY
ASTRAY
BEYOND
THE
EVIL
OF
INDIVIDUALS
THERE
WAS
THE
EVIL
OF
THE
SYSTEM
ITSELF
WHICH
WAS
SELF
GENERATING
AND
SELF
PERPETUATING
HITLER
WAS
AN
EXTREEMLY
EVIL
PERSON
WHO
BUILT
HIS
PARTY
ARROUND
AN
EGO
CULT
CENTERED
ON
THE
DEMONSTRATION
OF
HIS
OWN
POWER
THIS
DOES
NOT
HOWEVER
MEAN
THAT
HE
WAS
AS
ENTIRELY
FREE
FROM
POLITICAL
CONSTRAINTS
AS
HE
AND
HIS
PROPAGANDISTS
WORKED
SO
HARD
TO
ASSERT
THE
MYTH
THAT
RACISM
CAN
PRODUCE
A
STRONG
GOVERNMENT
THAT
CAN
CURE
A
NATIONS
ILLS
MUST
BE
EMPHATICALLY
REJECTED
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
WE
MUST
ACCEPT
A
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
A
GOVENRMENT
THAT
DEMONSTRATES
ITS
STRENGTH
AND
ONE
THAT
IS
ABLE
TO
GOVERN
DECISIVELY
IN
THE
MANNER
IT
BELEIVES
IS
BEST
I
WOULD
ACCEPT
ONLY
THE
LATTER
AS
A
STRONG
GOVERNMENT
SINCE
MOST
DISPLAYS
OF
STRENGTH
ARE
MADE
NECESSARY
BY
AN
ESSENTIAL
WEAKNESS
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
NAZIS
WERE
NOT
STUPID
NOR
WERE
THEY
AMORAL
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
THEY
LACKED
MORAL
SCRUPLES
THEY
ACTED
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER
AS
THE
SPANISH
INQUISITION
MURDER
AND
TORTURE
IN
THE
CAUSE
OF
MORALITY
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
NAZIS
LIES
IN
THEIR
AXIOMS
NOT
IN
THEIR
LOGIC
NOR
IN
THEIR
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
THOSE
AXIOMS
THUS
ALL
SUCH
PARTIES
SUCH
AS
THE
NATIONAL
FRONT
OR
DAVID
DUKES
KLU
KLUX
KLAN
FRONT
WHO
ASSERT
THE
TRUTH
OF
THOSE
AXIOMS
MUST
BE
CONSIDERED
FOR
WHAT
THEY
ARE
ADVOCATES
OF
A
SYSTEM
THAT
WOULD
COMMIT
GENOCIDE
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
HITLER
WAS
NOT
ONLY
RESPONSIBLE
BUT
IMENSELY
EVIL
IS
INESCAPABLE
FROM
THE
HISTORICAL
RECORD
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
THOUGH
TO
NOT
LET
THE
CONCLUSION
BE
REACHED
THAT
THE
NAZIS
ESPOUSED
A
SET
OF
IDEAS
THAT
WERE
BASICALLY
CORRECT
BUT
HAD
AN
UNFORTUNATE
PROPONENT
THE
EVILS
OF
THE
CONCEPT
OF
RACE
SUPREMACY
ARE
PRIMARY
ALTHOUGH
THIS
MOST
EMPHATICALY
DOES
NOT
EXCUSE
INDIVIDUAL
CULPABILITY
THIS
IS
NEVERTHELESS
SECONDARY
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
PROMISES
MADE
BY
A
RACIST
SUPREMACIST
PARTY
UPON
ELECTION
THOSE
PROMISES
WILL
BE
BROKEN
AS
SOON
AS
CIRCUMSTANCES
PERMIT
IF
THIS
REQUIRES
THE
REPLACEMENT
OF
THE
LEADERS
THAT
ORIGINALLY
MADE
THE
PLEDGES
THAT
WILL
OCCUR
HATRED
IS
A
SUPREME
JUSTIFIER
IT
ALSO
CREATES
A
DYNAMIC
OF
ITS
OWN
WHEN
THOSE
IN
GOVERNMENT
ALLOW
IT
REIGN
FOR
MANY
IN
GOVERNMENT
POLITICS
IS
A
METHOD
OF
PROVIDING
A
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
THEIR
OWN
EXISTENCE
THROUGH
A
DEMONSTRATION
OF
THEIR
IMPORTANCE
A
RHETORIC
OF
HATRED
INEVITABLY
DEVELOPS
THE
QUESTION
OF
ACTION
SINCE
THE
CONTINUED
EXISTENCE
OF
AN
OBJECT
OF
HATRED
IS
INEVITABLY
A
REMINDER
OF
THE
ESSENTIAL
IMPOTENCE
OF
THE
POLITICIAN
THUS
WE
HAVE
THE
US
RAID
ON
TRIPOLI
WHICH
HAS
LITTLE
PURPOSE
BEYOND
A
DEMONSTRATION
OF
POWER
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
REALISE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
QUANTUM
JUMP
BETWEEN
THE
POLITICS
OF
THE
RIGHT
AND
THOSE
OF
THE
EXTREEME
RIGHT
BUT
A
PROGRESSION
FROM
THE
REINFORCEMENT
OF
POPULAR
PREDJUDICE
TO
ACTION
BEING
TAKEN
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THAT
PREDJUDICE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
THE
EXTREEME
LEFT
TRACE
THEIR
ROUTE
TO
DESPOTISM
THROUGH
THEIR
ASSERTION
OF
THE
SUBJUGATION
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
TO
IDEOLOGY
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
THOUGH
THAT
IN
ATTEMPTING
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
DYNAMICS
OF
POLITICAL
SYSTEMS
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
USED
TO
EXCUSE
THE
PARTICIPANTS
THE
LEADERS
OF
A
NATION
TAKE
ON
A
SUPREME
MORAL
BURDEN
BUT
NOT
ONLY
DO
SO
VOLUNTARILY
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
STIVE
TO
DO
SO
THUS
TO
TAKE
ON
SUCH
A
TASK
WITHOUT
A
FUNDAMENTAL
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
LOGICAL
PROGRESSION
OF
ONES
SET
OF
AXIOMS
TO
ITS
CONCLUSION
IN
ITSELF
IS
A
MORAL
CRIME
FURTHERMORE
IN
TAKING
ON
SUCH
A
DUTY
ONE
IS
OBLIGED
TO
PUT
THE
INTEREST
OF
THE
WHOLE
BEFORE
PERSONAL
CONCERNS
EVEN
OF
PERSONAL
SECURITY
ALTHOUGH
IT
WAS
INEVITABLE
THAT
A
PARTY
SUCH
AS
THE
NAZIS
BASED
UPON
HATRED
AND
AN
IDOLISATION
OF
THE
SYMBOLS
OF
POWER
SHOULD
HAVE
SAUGHT
TO
COMMIT
GENOCIDE
IT
WAS
NOT
INEVITABLE
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
SUCCEEDED
EACH
MEMBER
OF
THE
SYSTEM
HAD
AN
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
A
CHANGE
WITHIN
IT
THAT
HAD
A
POSSIBILITY
OF
CHANGING
THE
DYNAMIC
REALISING
THAT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
CANNOT
HOPE
TO
CONTROL
A
SYSTEM
DOES
NOT
MEAN
ACCEPTING
THAT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
CANNOT
AFFECT
THE
SYSTEM
