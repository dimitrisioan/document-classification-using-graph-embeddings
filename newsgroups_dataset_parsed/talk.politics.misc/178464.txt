RE
HOW
MANY
HOMOSEXUALS
ARE
THERE
I
AM
SO
TIRED
ABOUT
ALL
THIS
DEBATE
ON
HOW
MANY
GAYS
THERE
ARE
SUCH
ARGUMENTS
ARE
BASICALLY
WORTHLESS
IMHO
WOULD
IT
REALLY
MATTER
IF
IT
WERE
MILLIONS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
REGULARLY
DENIED
ACCESS
TO
HOUSING
EMPLOYMENT
AND
PERSONAL
SECURITY
OR
EVEN
ONLY
ONE
AS
FOR
DEATH
THREATS
I
HAPPEN
TO
KNOW
FROM
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
THAT
GAY
PEOPLE
ARE
FAR
MORE
LIKELY
TO
RECEIVE
THEM
BASED
ON
POLITICAL
VEIWS
OR
EVEN
PERSONAL
PHILOSOPHIES
RELATED
TO
THE
ISSUE
OF
SEXUAL
ORIENTATION
THAN
ARE
HETEROSEX
UALS
NOT
A
WEEK
GOES
BY
THAT
I
PERSONALLY
OR
ONE
OF
MY
FRIENDS
IS
NOT
PHYSICALLY
OR
VERBALLY
HARRASSED
FOR
EVEN
APPEARING
TO
BE
GAY
EVERYONE
IS
GARAUNTEED
CERTAIN
UNALIENABLE
RIGHTS
UNDER
OUR
CURRENT
FORM
OF
GOVERNMENT
IN
THEORY
YET
EVERY
DAY
GAY
PEOPLE
ARE
VICTIMIZED
BY
THEIR
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
BY
THE
POLICE
FORCE
AND
BY
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
AN
UNINFORMED
AND
IGNORANT
PUBLIC
IS
THIS
DEMOCRACY
I
DONT
THINK
SO
A
SOCIETYS
SENSE
OF
JUSTICE
IS
JUDGED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
TREATMENT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
MAKE
UP
THAT
SOCIETY
ALL
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
AND
YES
THAT
INCLUDES
GAYS
LESBIANS
AND
BISEXUALS
WHOSE
CRIMES
HAVE
NO
VICTIMS
AND
WHO
ARE
AS
VARIED
AND
DIVERSE
AS
THE
SOCIETY
OF
WICH
THEY
ARE
