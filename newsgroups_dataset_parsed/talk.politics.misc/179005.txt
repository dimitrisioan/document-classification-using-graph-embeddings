can
people
please
stop
the
i
thinkknow
the
batffbi
are
completely
responsible
but
theyll
cover
it
up
so
that
the
investigation
will
show
that
koresch
is
responsible
bs
well
they
could
unseal
the
original
warrent
why
was
i
sealed
in
the
first
place
release
their
video
tapes
from
their
listening
devices
inside
the
compound
and
quit
makeing
contradictory
statements
do
you
believe
their
statement
that
the
children
were
killed
by
lethal
injection
they
later
stated
that
the
childrens
bodies
were
burned
to
the
point
the
would
be
hard
to
identify
so
how
did
they
come
up
with
the
lethal
injection
theory
in
an
investigation
of
this
size
with
the
feds
state
and
civilians
involved
in
the
investigation
it
would
be
practially
impossible
to
cover
up
unless
the
evidence
was
destroyed
or
other
evidence
planted
and
with
republicans
like
arlen
spector
calling
for
investigations
this
isnt
going
to
be
handled
with
kid
gloves
you
mean
