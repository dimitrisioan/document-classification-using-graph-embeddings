RE
DEBATING
SPECIAL
HATE
CRIMES
LAWS
IN
ARTICLE
SAID
THIS
SORT
OF
SEPARATE
TREATMENT
BY
THE
LAW
HAS
NO
PLACE
IN
AN
EQUAL
SOCIETY
THE
SOLUTION
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
CLASSES
ARE
MORE
VULNERABLE
TO
ATTACK
OR
DISCRIMINATION
IS
TO
DO
WHAT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
DONE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
IMBALANCES
IN
CRIMINAL
ACTIVITY
AND
CITIZEN
PROTECTION
TO
ALLOCATE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
RESOURCES
TO
MORE
EFFICIENTLY
AND
EFFECTIVELY
DEAL
WITH
THE
PROBLEMS
NOT
TO
REWRITE
THE
LAW
ITSELF
WDSTARR
SO
HOW
DO
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
INCREASED
PENALTIES
FOR
KILLING
A
POLICEMAN
A
FEDERAL
EMPLOYEE
OR
TO
USE
BOTH
SCALIAS
AND
STEVENSS
EXAMPLE
INCREASED
PENALTIES
FOR
THREATENING
THE
PRESIDENT
IM
ASSUMING
THAT
LIKE
ALL
GOOD
PEOPLE
YOU
OPPOSE
THE
MARITAL
EXEMPTION
FOR
RAPE
SO
I
WONT
BRING
THAT
UP
IN
ORDER
OF
YOUR
QUESTIONS
I
OPPOSE
IT
I
OPPOSE
IT
I
OPPOSE
IT
AND
HUH
WHA
WHERE
DID
THAT
TOPIC
COME
FROM
AND
WHATS
IT
GOT
TO
DO
WITH
THE
DISCUSSION
AT
HAND
WHEN
I
WAS
DISCUSSING
THE
CONCEPT
OF
DIFFERENT
CRIMINAL
LAWS
FOR
CRIMES
AGAINST
DIFFERENT
CLASSES
OF
PEOPLE
AND
YES
I
DO
CONSIDER
LAWS
WHICH
ALLOWMANDATE
ENHANCED
PENALTIES
FOLLOWING
CONVICTION
BASED
UPON
THE
CONVICTS
ATTITUDES
TOWARDS
THE
CLASS
MEMBERSHIP
OF
THE
VICTIM
TO
FIT
INTO
THAT
CATEGORY
THE
CATEGORY
OF
CLASSES
I
HAD
IN
MIND
WAS
THAT
OF
THE
STANDARD
CIVIL
RIGHTS
DISCUSSION
CLASSES
BASED
UPON
RACE
GENDER
ETHNICITY
RELIGION
SEXUAL
ORIENTATION
ETC
HAVING
YOU
ASK
ABOUT
CLASSES
BASED
UPON
ONES
PROFESSION
RATHER
THAN
ONES
PERSONAL
CHARACTERISTICS
CAUGHT
ME
OFF
GUARD
AND
I
HAD
TO
THINK
OUT
THE
QUESTION
FROM
SCRATCH
WHAT
I
FINALLY
DECIDED
WAS
THAT
THE
LAW
SHOULD
NOT
RECOGNIZE
SUCH
CLASSES
BECAUSE
TO
DO
SO
WOULD
BE
TO
FORMALLY
AND
OFFICIALLY
DECLARE
SOME
PEOPLE
TO
BE
OF
MORE
WORTH
THAN
OTHERS
AND
THAT
WOULD
BE
ANATHEMA
TO
THE
UNDERLYING
AMERICAN
CONCEPT
OF
EQUAL
TREATMENT
UNDER
THE
LAW
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
A
FEDERAL
CRIME
BILL
WAS
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
EXPANDED
THE
FEDERAL
DEATH
PENALTY
TO
AN
ADDITIONAL
FIFTYPLUS
CRIMES
INCLUDING
THE
MURDER
OF
VARIOUS
FEDERAL
OFFICERS
HITHERTO
NOT
PROTECTED
BY
THAT
AURA
OF
DETERRENCE
CRITICS
POINTED
OUT
THE
ABSURDITY
OF
HAVING
LAWS
WHICH
MADE
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
AVAILABLE
FOR
THE
MURDER
OF
A
FEDERAL
POSTAL
INSPECTOR
BUT
NOT
FOR
THER
MURDER
OF
A
CIVILIAN
TEACHER
WHEN
THE
LATTER
ARGUABLY
PROVIDED
A
MUCH
MORE
VALUEABLE
SERVICE
AND
THEREFORE
WOULD
BE
THE
GREATER
LOSS
TO
SOCIETY
THIS
WAS
AN
EMOTIONALLY
COMPELLING
ARGUMENT
BUT
EVEN
THE
PROPONENTS
OF
THAT
VIEWPOINT
APPEARED
TO
TACITLY
ASSUME
THAT
THE
STATE
SHOULD
JUDGE
SOME
LIVES
AS
BEING
MORE
VALUABLE
THAN
OTHERS
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THEIR
CONTRIBUTION
TO
SOCIETY
I
VIEW
THAT
DOCTRINE
AS
BEING
BOTH
A
PERSONALLY
REPUGNANT
AND
B
REPUGNANT
TO
THE
EQUAL
PROTECTION
CLAUSE
OF
THE
AMENDMENT
ACCORDINGLY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NO
LAWS
WHICH
GIVE
ANY
PROFESSIONBASED
CLASS
OF
PEOPLE
SPECIAL
PROTECTION
VIA
THE
MECHANISM
OF
SUPPLYING
STRONGER
STATUTORY
DETERRENCE
OF
CRIMES
AGAINST
MEMBERS
OF
THAT
CLASS
NOT
EVEN
POLICE
OFFICERS
FEDERAL
OFFICERS
OR
HIGHRANKING
MEMBERS
OF
THE
EXECUTIVE

OF
THE
