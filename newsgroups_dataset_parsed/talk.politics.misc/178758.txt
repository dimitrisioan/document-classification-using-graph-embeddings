p
male
sex
survey
gay
activity
low
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
the
figures
on
homosexuality
in
the
study
released
wednesday
by
the
alan
guttmacher
institute
are
significantly
lower
than
the
percent
figure
that
has
been
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
since
it
was
published
in
the
kinsey
report
so
what
homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in
child
molestation
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
but
many
of
the
people
who
will
be
marching
arent
homosexuals
but
other
members
of
the
leftist
agenda
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
dont
forget
that
had
or
more
partners
not
surprising
remember
that
study
includes
homosexuals
as
well
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
and
what
did
this
study
show
for
number
of
sexual
contacts
for
those
who
said
they
where
homosexual
or
is
that
number
to
inconvient
for
you
it
wasnt
published
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
fuck
off
typical
homoseuxal
