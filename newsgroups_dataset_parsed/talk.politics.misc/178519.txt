FILLIBUSTER

DAVID
VEAL
WRITES
COME
TO
THAT
UNDER
THE
ORIGINAL
PLAN
THERE
WASNT
MEANT
TO
BE
ANYTHING
MUCH
FOR
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TO
DO
EXCEPT
KEEP
THE
BRITISH
OUT
THATS
ALSO
UNTRUE
BUT
AT
LEAST
WERE
WANDERING
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
TOWARD
REALITY
THAT
THE
ARTICLES
OF
CONFEDERATION
FELL
APART
IS
ENOUGH
PROOF
IT
WAS
THERE
FOR
JUST
A
TAD
BIT
MORE
WELL
YES
AND
NO
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
ARE
PROPAGANDA
AND
IT
IS
THEREFORE
DIFFICULT
TO
DETERMINE
PRECISELY
WHAT
MADDISON
ETC
WERE
UP
TO
FROM
THEM
THEY
CERTAINLY
EMPHASISED
A
LIMITED
ROLE
FOR
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
BUT
THIS
WAS
NOT
NECESSARILY
THEIR
TRUE
POSITION
AND
LIKE
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
WHICH
IT
IS
COPIED
FROM
IT
WAS
GIVEN
PRETTY
WIDE
POWERS
UNFORTUNATELY
THEY
STARTED
TO
USE
THEM
AND
THUS
THE
GRIDLOCK
SET
IN
I
WASNT
AWARE
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
HAD
WIDE
POWERS
I
WAS
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
IS
WAS
PRETTY
POWERLESS
COMPARED
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
COMMONS
AND
CERTAINLY
DIDNT
HAVE
ALMOST
EQUAL
THEIR
POWERS
THE
SENATE
IS
RESTRICTED
ONLY
THAT
IT
MAY
NOT
INTRODUCE
BILLS
RELATING
TO
RAISING
REVENUE
THE
SENATE
WAS
LESS
POWERFUL
THAN
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
IN
THE
PERIOD
IN
QUESTION
THE
STRIPPING
OF
THE
POWERS
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
DID
NOT
OCCUR
UNTIL
AND
DAVID
LLLOYD
GEORGES
BUDGET
EVEN
DESPITE
THIS
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
HAS
CONSIDERABLE
POWER
EVEN
TODAY
AND
IS
FAR
FROM
A
RUBBER
STAMPING
BODY
MY
READING
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
OTHER
WRITINGS
GIVES
ME
ABSOLUTELY
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THE
SENATE
WASNT
INTENDED
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
THEIR
LAWMAKING
POWERS
IN
FACT
GRIDLOCK
APPEARS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
DESIGNED
INTO
THE
SYSTEM
WITH
THE
SENATE
BEING
A
MORE
DELIBERATIVE
BODY
TO
ACT
AS
A
CHECK
ON
THE
MOREOFTEN
ELECTED
HOUSE
THE
SYSTEM
IS
MEANT
TO
BE
SLOW
TO
REACT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
IT
ENDED
UP
A
BIT
TOO
SLOW
ON
WHAT
BASIS
DO
YOU
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
SENATE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
SOME
SORT
OF
RUBBERSTAMP
FOR
THE
HOUSE
YOULL
NOTE
THAT
WHILE
THE
PRESIDENTS
VETO
MAY
BE
OVERRIDDEN
THE
HOUSE
CANT
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
A
VETO
BY
THE
SENATE
THE
PRESIDENT
VETO
WAS
MEANT
TO
BE
ENTIRELY
SEPARATE
UNTIL
BUSH
ABUSED
IT
IN
A
QUITE
EXTRAORDINARY
MANNER
IT
WAS
USED
MORE
IN
ACCORD
WITH
THE
INTENT
OF
BEING
A
CHECK
ON
UNREASONABLE
LEGISLATION
THE
VETO
WAS
CLEARLY
REGARDED
AS
A
COMPLETELY
LAST
GASP
MEASURE
ITS
USE
WAS
MEANT
TO
BE
RESTRICTED
TO
PREVENTING
THE
LEGISLATURE
INTERFERING
WITH
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
EXECUTIVE
THE
SENATE
IS
NOT
MEANT
TO
BE
EXACTLY
A
RUBBER
STAMP
BODY
IT
IS
MEANT
AS
A
CHECK
ON
UNRESTRAINED
LEGISLATION
THAT
IS
THE
EXTRA
MEASURE
BUILT
INTO
THE
CONSTITUTION
IN
FAVOUR
OF
THE
STATUS
QUO
OF
THE
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
STATES
IS
NOT
A
REASONABLE
RESTRICTION
