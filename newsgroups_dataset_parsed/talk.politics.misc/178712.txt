mr
cramer
you
are
on
one
hand
condemning
the
news
media
as
the
role
of
the
national
news
media
in
inflaming
passions
that
was
your
message
subject
i
believe
then
you
turn
around
and
actually
take
from
the
santa
rosa
cal
pressdemocrat
april
p
male
sex
survey
gay
activity
low
title
you
even
use
such
a
title
for
the
san
jose
mercury
news
the
murky
news
now
which
is
it
are
you
going
to
comdemn
national
media
then
turn
around
and
use
it
to
support
some
position
you
present
seems
somewhat
contradictory
doesnt
it
i
believe
that
this
is
not
contradictory
on
the
basis
that
the
quality
of
media
reporting
varies
greatly
based
on
the
subject
at
hand
the
media
has
proven
itself
very
accurate
is
the
areas
of
presenting
raw
undisputed
data
one
good
example
would
be
the
weather
page
in
which
high
and
low
temperatures
of
the
previous
day
for
a
large
number
of
locations
are
posting
there
is
little
evidence
to
show
that
they
are
in
error
the
american
media
has
failed
us
in
its
analysis
of
complex
events
however
im
sure
that
we
can
come
up
with
many
news
stories
that
have
left
us
angry
because
so
many
facts
have
been
ommitted
cases
that
come
to
mind
are
the
invasion
of
panama
the
war
with
iraq
the
disaster
in
waco
the
issues
surrounding
the
acceptance
of
gays
into
the
military
the
war
on
drugs
and
many
others
the
story
that
you
bring
to
light
was
regarding
the
new
sex
survey
while
im
sure
that
due
to
lazyness
some
of
the
data
was
ommitted
from
the
article
i
would
venture
to
guess
that
the
data
that
was
presented
did
not
deviate
from
the
survey
i
do
however
think
that
it
would
be
folly
to
have
blind
faith
in
a
single
newswriters
analysis
of
this
data
in
this
particular
case
there
was
little
analysis
and
the
reader
was
left
to
draw
hisher
own
convictions
many
netters
mr
cramer
included
often
forget
that
the
american
media
are
merely
a
number
of
businesses
whos
purpose
in
life
is
to
make
money
for
their
owners
and
stockholders
revenues
come
largely
from
advertisers
who
merely
want
maximum
useful
exposure
per
dollar
the
media
is
like
fast
food
the
quality
of
the
food
or
of
the
reporting
will
improve
only
if
the
customers
demand
as
such
otherwise
it
is
business
as
usual
