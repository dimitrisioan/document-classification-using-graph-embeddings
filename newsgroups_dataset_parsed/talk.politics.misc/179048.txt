you
are
speculating
that
the
fbi
purposely
started
the
fire
please
if
youve
got
such
a
ridiculously
extraordinary
claim
and
have
no
evidence
whatsoever
at
least
give
us
a
speculatory
reason
why
the
fbi
would
want
to
do
such
a
thing
the
possibility
that
the
fire
was
started
accidentally
is
much
more
reasonable
but
we
dont
have
anything
but
contradictory
anecdotal
evidence
right
now

mr

i
dont
recall
seeing
your
byline
around
much
before
at
least
on
tpm
let
me
clue
you
in
on
this
newsgroup
tpm
is
populated
largely
by
people
whose
hatred
for
the
us
government
especially
the
government
of
mr
clinton
is
literally
boundless
to
these
people
the
suggestion
that
agents
of
the
us
government
would
carry
out
a
spectacular
massacre
of
its
own
citizens
in
full
view
of
tv
cameras
is
not
an
extraordinary
claim
its
just
another
day
in
the
life
of
these
united
states
they
dont
have
to
suggest
any
reason
why
the
fbi
would
want
to
publicly
massacre
citizens
have
you
seen
the
crying
game
its
in
their
nature
