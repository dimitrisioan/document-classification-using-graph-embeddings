and
like
the
house
of
lords
which
it
is
copied
from
it
was
given
pretty
wide
powers
unfortunately
they
started
to
use
them
and
thus
the
gridlock
set
in
i
wasnt
aware
the
house
of
lords
had
wide
powers
i
was
under
the
impression
is
was
pretty
powerless
compared
to
the
house
of
commons
and
certainly
didnt
have
almost
equal
their
powers
the
senate
is
restricted
only
that
it
may
not
introduce
bills
relating
to
raising
revenue
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
in
the
period
in
question
the
stripping
of
the
powers
of
the
house
of
lords
did
not
occur
until
and

budget
even
despite
this
the
house
of
lords
has
considerable
power
even
today
and
is
far
from
a
rubber
stamping
body
just
how
much
power
does
the
house
of
lords
have
now
who
said
anything
about
panicking

this
is
still
just

into
the
situation
and

my
bearings
then
