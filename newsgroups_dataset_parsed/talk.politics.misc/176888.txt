SAID
A
REAL
WORLD
DATA
POINT
A
PERSON
HAS
A
MUCH
STRONGER
LEGAL
CLAIM
FOR
HARRASSMENT
SEXUAL
OR
OTHERWISE
IF
THEY
MAKE
IT
CLEAR
TO
THE
OFFENDER
THAT
THEIR
BEHAVIOUR
IS
UNWANTED
IF
THE
BEHAVIOUR
PERSISTS
HARRASSMENT
IS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
DEMONSTRATE
DUE
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
OFFENDER
KNEW
THAT
THE
BEHAVIOUR
WAS
UNWANTED
NO
ARGUMENT
HERE
MY
ORIGINAL
QUERY
REGARDED
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHY
THE
FIRST
SEXUAL
PROPOSITION
MADE
BY
PERSON
A
TO
PERSON
B
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
SEXUAL
HARASSMENT
BY
SOMEMANY
PEOPLE
ASSUMING
OF
COURSE
THAT
THERE
DOES
NOT
EXIST
A
POWER
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
A
AND
B
SUCH
THAT
THE
PROPOSITION
CARRIES
STRONG
IMPLICATIONS
OF
EXTORTION
RIGHT
FROM
WORD
ONE
I
CAN
ONLY
SAY
THAT
THOSE
PEOPLE
ARE
WRONG
THE
WORD
HARASS
MEANS
TO
IRRITATE
OR
TORMENT
PERSISTENTLY
ID
HARDLY
CONSIDER
ONE
TIME
TO
FALL
UNDER
THE
DEFINITION
OF
PERSISTENT
ADDITIONALLY
THERE
IS
NO
BASIS
TO
ASSUME
THE
BEHAVIOUR
IS
UNWANTED
UNLIKE
AN
ILLEGAL
PROPOSITION
OF
COURSE
I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
OF
OFFERING
MONEY
FOR
SEX
IS
INARGUABLY
HARRASSMENT
BECAUSE
THE
ACTIVITY
IS
ILLEGAL
AND
COULD
BE
PRESUMED
TO
BE
UNWANTED
BY
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
I
HAVE
TO
TAKE
ISSUE
WITH
THIS
VIEWPOINT
GIVEN
THAT
A
PROSTITUTION
IS
A
VICTIMLESS
CRIME
AND
B
THERE
ARE
LITERALLY
MILLIONS
OF
AMERICANS
WHO
PARTICIPATE
IN
SOME
SORT
OF
VICTIMLESS
ACTIVITIES
WHICH
THE
STATE
HAS
DEFINED
TO
BE
CRIMINAL
EG
PROSTITUTION
OBSCENITY
GAMBLING
USING
CERTAIN
RECREATIONAL
DRUGS
HAVING
NONMERCENARY
SEX
WITH
PERSONS
NOT
ONES
SPOUSE
IN
CERTAIN
STATES
HAVING
UNNATURAL
SEX
WITH
PEOPLE
REGARDLESS
OF
MARITAL
STATUS
OR
EXCHANGE
OF
MONEY
IN
CERTAIN
STATES
ETC
ID
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
IDEA
THAT
AN
ACTIVITY
MAY
BE
PRESUMED
TO
BE
UNWANTED
BY
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
MERELY
BECAUSE
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
IS
THE
SORT
OF
SOPHISTRY
THAT
ONLY
A
JUDGE
COULD
INDULGE
IN
WITH
A
STRAIGHT
FACE
HE
SAID
SPEAKING
AS
A
LAW
STUDENT
WHOS
READ
HIS
SHARE
OF
JUDICIAL
OPINIONS
IN
WHICH
REALITY
WAS
NOT
ONLY
DENIED
BUT
IN
FACT
ACTUALLY
INVERTED
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
THE
UNIVERSE
CONFORM
TO
THE
WRITERS
POLITICS
I
WAS
SPEAKING
FROM
A
LEGALISTIC
VIEWPOINT
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
TRUE
BUT
THE
LAW
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
WHAT
LITTLE
SENSE
IT
MANAGES
TO
MAKE
HAS
TO
MAKE
SOME
ASSUMPTIONS
ASSUMING
THAT
AN
ILLEGAL
ACTIVITY
IS
UNWANTED
BY
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
I
THINK
IS
REASONABLE
CERTAINLY
I
WOULD
NEED
A
PREPONDERANCE
OF
EVIDENCE
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
PROPOSITIONER
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
REASONABLE
BELIEF
THAT
THE
PROPOSITION
WAS
WELCOME
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
PARTICIPATE
IN
VICTIMLESS
CRIMES
NOTWITHSTANDING
THE
FACT
REAMINS
THAT
UNDER
THE
LAW
THE
ACTIVITY
IS
ILLEGAL
TO
PRESUME
THAT
THE
PROPOSITION
IS
WELCOME
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
INDULGE
IN
IT
IS
THE
TYPE
OF
SOPHISTRY
ONLY
A
LAWYER
COULD
INDULGE
IN
WITH
A
STRAIGHT
FACE
DALE
COOK
ANY
TOWN
HAVING
MORE
CHURCHES
THAN
BARS
HAS
A
SERIOUS
SOCIAL
PROBLEM
EDWARD
ABBEY
THE
OPINIONS
ARE
MINE
ONLY
IE
THEY
ARE
NOT
MY
EMPLOYERS
