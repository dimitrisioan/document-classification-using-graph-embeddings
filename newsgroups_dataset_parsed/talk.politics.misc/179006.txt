MATTHEW
T
RUSSOTTO
WRITES
WERE
HEARING
IT
IT
SURE
RINGS
TRUE
ITS
CONSISTENT
IN
A
WAY
THAT
MASS
SUICIDE
BY
FIRE
IS
NOT
THIS
SURVIVOR
IS
ALSO
SAYING
THAT
THEY
WERE
TRAPPED
INSIDE
BY
THE
DAMAGE
DONE
BY
THE
TANKS
WHY
IS
AN
ACCIDENTAL
FIRE
MORE
PLAUSIBLE
THAN
A
MASS
SUICIDE
CONSIDERING
THAT
THE
DAVIDIANS
WERE
AN
APOCALYPTIC
CULT
WITH
A
HISTORY
OF
ARMED
VIOLENCE
IF
THE
FBI
HAS
REASON
TO
LIE
ABOUT
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
FIRE
IF
IT
RESULTED
FROM
THEIR
OWN
NEGLIGENCE
THEN
THE
BD
SURVIVORS
ALSO
HAVE
REASON
TO
LIE
IF
THEY
STARTED
THE
BLAZE
THE
FBI
CLAIMS
THE
FIRE
WAS
SET
SIMULTANEOUSLY
IN
THREE
PLACES
THEY
CLAIM
THE
BUILDING
WAS
FILLED
WITH
TEAR
GAS
ELECTRICITY
WAS
CUT
OFF
TANKS
WERE
ROLLING
ALL
AROUND
HOW
DID
THE
BDS
COORDINATE
THE
SETTING
OF
THE
FIRE
ITS
FAIRLY
SIMPLE
IT
WAS
DECIDED
TO
BURN
THE
PLACE
DOWN
AND
MORE
THAN
ONE
AGENT
WAS
DISPATCHED
TO
SET
THE
FIRES
IN
SEPARATE
PARTS
OF
THE
COMPOUND
I
DOUBT
THAT
SIMULTANEOUSLY
MEANS
AT
THE
EXACT
SAME
TIME
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
LIKELY
MEANS
CLOSE
ENOUGH
TOGETHER
TO
PRECLUDE
THEM
FROM
BEING
PART
OF
THE
SAME
FIRE
THE
FBI
CLAIMS
THAT
MEN
WITH
TORCHES
SET
THE
FIRES
BUT
HAVENT
RELEASED
ANY
EVIDENCE
OF
THIS
THOUGH
IT
SEEMS
INCONCIEVABLE
THAT
THEY
DONT
HAVE
ANY
IF
IT
WAS
TRUE
THEY
MIGHT
BE
WAITING
UNTIL
THE
EVIDENCE
COMES
IN
FROM
THE
SITE
AND
THE
INVESTIGATION
IS
AT
LEAST
WELL
UNDERWAY
ALL
OF
THE
BDS
PREVIOUS
ACTIONS
WERE
AIMED
TOWARDS
THEIR
SURVIVAL
NOT
THEIR
DEATH
THE
SAME
COULD
BE
SAID
OF
JONESTOWN
THE
IDEA
THAT
KEROSENE
LAMPS
WOULD
BE
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
WITH
ELECTRICITY
CUT
OFF
MAKES
SENSE
THE
IDEA
THAT
RAMMING
TANKS
INTO
THE
BUILDING
WOULD
SPILL
THEM
AND
CAUSE
A
FIRE
MAKES
SENSE
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THE
FBI
WOULDNT
KNOW
THIS
IS
NIL
IT
WASNT
SIMPLE
NEGLIGENCE
MAYBE
THEN
AGAIN
IVE
BEEN
SUPRISED
AT
WHAT
FOLKS
HAVE
MISSED
IN
THE
PAST
IN
SIMILAR
SITUATIONS
DONT
