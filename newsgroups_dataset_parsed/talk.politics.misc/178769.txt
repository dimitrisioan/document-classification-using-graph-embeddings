IM
SURPRISED
YOU
MISSED
IT
ITS
RIGHT
THERE
IN
THE
FIRST
PARAGRAPH
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
AT
LEAST
THROUGH
THE
PREAMBLE
YOU
ALMOST
GOT
IT
RIGHT
AND
IT
WAS
A
GOOD
TRY
BUT
YOU
SHOULD
FOLLOW
YOUR
OWN
ADVICE
THE
PREAMBLE
TO
THE
CONSTITUTION
DOES
READ
AS
YOU
HAVE
QUOTED
BUT
LET
US
NOT
FORGET
THAT
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
ONLY
THE
PREAMBLE
IT
IS
NOT
A
BINDING
PART
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
CARRIES
NO
WEIGHT
IN
THE
LAW
THAT
POOR
TORTURED
PARAGRAPH
HAS
GOT
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
UNFORTUNATE
PASSAGES

ONLY
HAS

TO
PROMOTING
THE

TO
BE

TO

SURE
EVERYONE
UNDERSTOOD
THEY
MEANT
