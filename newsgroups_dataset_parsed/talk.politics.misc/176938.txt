there
was
once
the
following
joke
how
many
supplysiders
does
it
take
to
screw
in
a
light
bulb
none
they
let
the
free
market
do
it
if
the
free
market
places
an
attractive
price
on
the
screwing
in
of
a
light
bulb
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
that
the
light
bulb
will
most
certainly
get
screwed
in
and
most
promptly
at
that
too
the
views
expressed
herein
are
theodore
a
kaldis
my
own
only
do
you
seriously
kaldisremusrutgersedu
believe
that
a
major
university
rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
as
this
would
hold
such
views
