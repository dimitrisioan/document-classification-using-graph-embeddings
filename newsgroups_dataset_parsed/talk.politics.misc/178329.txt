THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THIS
LAW
PROTECTS
NO
ONE
BUT
THE
ESTABLISHED
CAR
DEALERS
OR
PEOPLE
WITH
ENOUGH
MONEY
TO
START
A
FAIRLY
BIG
OPERATION
ALL
AT
ONCE
PROTECTING
THESE
FOLKS
FROM
COMPETITION
PROTECTS
THE
REST
OF
US
FROM
LOW
PRICES
AND
HIGH
QUALITY
AN
EXCELLENT
POINT
BUT
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
MISSING
A
MORE
SUBTLE
POINT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT
SHOULD
BE
THE
RECIPIENT
OF
YOUR
DISPLEASURE
BUT
THE
ESTABLISHED
BUSINESS
INTERESTS
THAT
INFLUENCE
AND
DIRECT
GOVERNMENT
ACTION
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
IS
THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT
IS
PREVENTING
ENTRY
TO
THE
MARKET
THE
DESIRE
OF
THOSE
RUNNING
ESTABLISHED
BUSINESSES
TO
PREVENT
OR
RESTRICT
THE
ENTRY
OF
COMPETITORS
IS
AN
UNDERSTANDABLE
THOUGH
GENERALLY
UNPLEASANT
HUMAN
FAILING
BUT
WITHOUT
A
MEANS
TO
ACT
ON
THIS
DESIRE
WITHOUT
A
GOVERNMENT
WITH
SUFFICIENT
POWER
TO
RESTRICT
THE
OPTIONS
OF
THE
POTENTIAL
COMPETITOR
THE
ANTICOMPETITIVE
DESIRE
REMAINS
JUST
AN
UNPLEASANT
WISH
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
THE
LINCHPIN
SO
WE
SEEK
TO
DISENGAGE
IT
SO
WE
DONT
GET
THE
SHAFT
ONCE
AGAIN
MARK
YOU
DONT
SPECIFY
THE
MEANS
THROUGH
WHICH
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
TO
BE
PREVENTED
FROM
BECOMING
THE

CONVENTIONAL
LIBERAL
IM
JUST
AS
WILLING
AS
YOU
ARE
TO
VOTE
AGAINST
ANTICOMPETITIVE
REGULATIONS
THAT
FAVOR
AUTO
DEALERS
BUT
WHAT
I
HEAR
FROM
LIBERTARIANS
IS
A
DESIRE
TO
LIMIT
INCUMBENTS
TERMS
TO

GOVERNMENT
BY
ELIMINATING
ITS
