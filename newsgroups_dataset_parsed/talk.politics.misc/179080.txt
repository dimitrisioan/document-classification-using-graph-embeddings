JOHN
F
CARR
WRITES
I
RECOMMEND
THE
BOOK
ADAMS
V
TEXAS
THE
STORY
OF
A
MAN
ADAMS
WHO
WAS
SENTENCED
TO
DEATH
FOR
A
CRIME
HE
DIDNT
COMMIT
MOST
OF
THE
BOOK
IS
THE
STORY
OF
THE
LONG
APPEALS
PROCESS
AND
THE
PROBLEMS
AND
DELAYS
CAUSED
BY
NOT
BEING
ABLE
TO
INTRODUCE
NEW
EVIDENCE
IN
CERTAIN
COURTS
AND
I
RECOMMEND
THE
MOVIE
THE
THIN
BLUE
LINE
WHICH
IS
ABOUT
THE
SAME
CASE
NOT
AS
MUCH
LEGAL
DETAIL
BUT
STILL
AN
EXCELLENT
FILM
IT
SHOWS
HOW
VERY
EASY
IT
IS
TO
COME
UP
WITH
SEEMINGLY
CONCLUSIVE
EVIDENCE
AGAINST
SOMEONE
WHOM
YOU
THINK
IS
GUILTY
MATTHEW
AUSTERN
MAYBE
WE
CAN
EVENTUALLY
MAKE
