well
i
just
did
a
quick
medline
scan
and
came
up
with
the
following
article
by
tashkin
that
reviews
the
literature
id
probably
start
here

why
isnt
this
information
in
the
faq
on
marijuana
if
we
expect
people
to
think
we
are
telling
them
the
truth
about
drugs
why
does
this
group
constantly
refute
every
negative
thing
about
almost
all
drugs
maybe
because
the
claims
deserve
refute
the
above
abstract
lists
various
possible
links
to
cannabis
use
unfiltered
almost
guaranteed
and
lung
problems
someone
may
get
overly
excited
when
they
see
that
article
but
without
actually
digging
up
the
study
and
seeing
how
the
studies
gathered
their
data
it
really
doesnt
tell
you
shit
im
going
to
track
down
that
study
hopefully
tomarrow
i
never
claimed
pot
was
more
or
less
damageing
than
cigarettesi
was
just
trying
to
keep
ourselves
honest
if
we
are
going
to
educate
kidsand
adultsand
tell
them
the
truth
about
drugs
dont
you
think
a
much
better
approach
would
be
to
list
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
type
of
drug
what
justifies
the
truth
about
drugs
research
what
sort
of
research
correlational
data
can
help
establish
a
theory
but
it
does
not
prove
anything
how
can
you
expect
someone
to
make
a
decision
when
the
pdfa
on
one
hand
says
that
all
drugs
are
absolutely
bad
bad
badand
this
newsgroup
consistently
refuses
to
admit
that
drugs
like
heroin
even
have
negative
side
effects
heroin
is
a
relatively
safe
drug
what
makes
it
unsafe
are
iv
administration
and
shit
like
adulterants
there
are
side
effects
like
withdrawal
but
they
effect
people
differently
ive
seen
numerous
posts
claiming
heroin
has
lower
addiction
rates
that
cigarettes
which
might
be
true
but
it
is
very
deceiving
because
heroin
is
much
more
harmful
drug
to
be
addicted
to
than
cigarettes
heroin
addicts
are
far
more
prone
to
end
up
in
the
gutter
and
destroy
their
family
and
friends
than
people
addicted
to
just
cigarettes
stereotypical
statement
i
know
people
who
use
heroin
and
opiates
that
function
just
fine
in
society
this
group
does
provide
some
very
good
information
to
people
but
i
am
worried
that
the
prolegalizationprodecriminalization
movement
is
being
hurt
when
it
refuses
to
admit
that
anysome
drugs
are
very
harmful
name
some
of
these
drugs
so
we
can
debate
about
them
more
specifically
im
all
for
legalization
of
most
drugs
but
when
someone
asks
me
about
relative
risks
of
certain
drugs
or
possible
bad
side
effects
i
would
like
to
know
themand
not
be
given
the
runaround
by
this
groupwhich
recently
tried
to
tell
me
that
pot
was
not
harmful
in
any
manner
to
peoples
lungs
no
no
no
or
at
least
i
havent
been
arguing
this
there
is
not
enough
data
to
form
a
scientific
conclusion
that
doesnt
mean
that
cannabis
is
benign
to
users
lungs
we
can
form
all
the
theories
we
want
but
they
are
only
theories
some
theories
are
supported
by
more
evidence
than
others
and
that
makes
them
stronger
i
think
its
time
yall
reexamined
your
positions
and
try
to
understand
that
you
cannot
fight
the
pdfa
by
calling
them
a
bunch
of
liars
the
hell
i
cant
they
state
unjustified
conclusions
as
fact
as
a
political
strategy
to
stop
drug
use
in
general
i
somewhat
see
what
youre
saying
and
people
like
jack
herer
contribute
to
this
this
has
been
quite
a
big
mindfuck
for
me
recently
and
ive
pretty
came
to
the
conclusion
that
you
cant
trust
anybody
by
word
of
mouth
alone
my
attitude
about
the
general
population
has
decreased
significantly
gotta
run
to
class
