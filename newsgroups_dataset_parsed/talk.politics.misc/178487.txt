ROGER
COLLINS
WRITES
LOOK
AT
THE
WHOLE
PICTURE
NOT
JUST
RANDOMLY
PICKED
LIBERTARIAN
POSITIONS
IF
GOVERNMENT
IS
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
USE
NONINITIATED
FORCE
TO
ACHIEVE
ITS
GOALS
THAN
NO
SPECIAL
INTEREST
CAN
INFLUENCE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
USE
NONINITIATED
FORCE
ON
THEIR
BEHALF
EITHER
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
FORCE
AVAILABLE
TO
IT
OR
IT
DOESNT
THE
LIBERTARIAN
POSITION
IS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
CAN
USE
FORCE
ONLY
WHEN
SOMEONE
ELSE
USES
FORCE
FIRST
EVEN
WHEN
THAT
FIRST
FORCE
IS
NOT
DIRECTED
AGAINST
THE
GOVERNMENT
BUT
ONE
OF
ITS
CITIZENS
THAT
ALL
BEING
TRUE
WHAT
SAFEGUARDS
DO
WE
HAVE
AGAINST
THE
GOVERNMENT
CLAIMING
THAT
SOME
INITIATION
OF
FORCE
ON
ITS
PART
IS
REALLY
A
RESPONSE
LIKE
THE
BURNING
OF
THE
MAINE
THE
TONKIN
GULF
INCIDENT
OR
THE
ASSAULT
ON
WACO
