the
economic
and
political
ignorance
of
most
americans
can
be
truly
scary
price
controls
and
government
intervention
the
surest
route
to
disaster
its
amazing
people
never
seem
to
learn
from
history
or
common
sense
price
controls
do
not
and
cannot
work
i
would
have
thought
our
last
experiment
in
the
would
have
been
enough
to
dampen
the
belief
that
price
controls
can
actually
work
as
for
government
intervention
people
never
seem
to
get
the
irony
of
what
the
are
saying
we
are
told
that
entitlements
are
the
biggest
portion
of
the
budget
and
they
must
be
controlled
we
are
presented
with
horror
stories
of
waste
and
fraud
in
almost
all
government
agencies
we
are
shown
stories
about
the
miserable
treatment
our
veterans
get
in
our
government
run
hospitals
we
are
just
now
seeing
stories
about
how
social
security
isnt
going
to
cut
it
in
the
future
as
if
that
should
come
as
any
surprise
and
yet
people
choose
to
ignore
all
of
that
and
believe
in
the
fairy
tale
of
the
government
coming
to
the
rescue
simply
amazing
