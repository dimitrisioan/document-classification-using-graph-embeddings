THE

HAVE
SOME
FORM

EXTRA
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
SO
OF
HEALTH
COSTS
IN
EUROPE
ARE
OUT
OF
PRIVATE
FUNDS
AND
NOT
GLEANED
FROM
OTHER
TAXES
THE
GDP
FIGURES
ARE
COMBINED
PUBLIC
AND
PRIVATE
EXPENDITURES
FOR
TOTAL
OUTLAY
USING
THE
SAME
METHODS
THAT
YIELD
THE
FIGURE
FOR
THE
US
THAT
THE
FRENCH
HAD
DEDUCTIBLES
AND
COPAYMENTS
IN
THEIR
INSURANCE
FUND
IS
TO
THEIR
CREDIT
I
AM
IN
THE
MINORITY
FOR
ADVOCATING
SUCH
BACK
IN
CANADA
TO
MAKE
THE
CANADIAN
INSURANCE
LOOK
MORE
LIKE
REAL
HEALTH
INSURANCE
WHICH
ACTUALLY
IT
IS
THE
NEW
REFORM
PARTY
A
BREAKOFF
OF
TRADITIONALISTS
FROM
THE
CONSERVATIVES
WITH
A
MILDLY
LIBERTARIAN
FACTION
HOLD
OUR
PUBLIC
HEALTH
INSURANCE
AS
AN
UNTOUCHABLE
BUT
THAT
JUST
A
FEW
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
BE
REMINDED
THAT
ITS
NOT
FREE
THE
AVERAGE
CANADIANEUROPEAN
IS
MORE
FISCALLY
NAIVE
THAN
THEIR
AMERICAN
COUNTERPARTS
ON
ISSUES
LIKE
THESE
IM
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
PEOPLE
WHO
FAVOUR
COPAYMENTS
FORGET
ABOUT
LEFTISTS
EVEN
OUR
CONSERVATIVES
ATTACK
ME
FOR
IT
ON
THE
CANADIAN
NEWSGROUPS
TO
MAKE
IT
LOOK
MORE
LIKE
REAL
INSURANCE
COS
THE
INSURANCE
PAYMENT
IS
HIDDEN
UNLIKE
IN
FRANCE
AND
IF
YOU
DIDNT
KNOW
IT
YOUD
BELIEVE
IT
ACTUALLY
IS
SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE
AMERICAN
CONSERVATIVESLIBERTARIANS
AND
CANADIAN
LEFTISTS
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
SERIOUSLY
CALL
IT
THAT
CANADIANS
ARENT
WORRIED
ABOUT
THE
AMERICANS
WHO
SPEND
WERE
WORRIED
ABOUT
THE
FRENCH
AND
GERMANS
WHO
SPEND
TO
OUR
SO
THE
INSURANCE
IS
LOOKING
AT
THINGS
THAT
SHOULDNT
BE
PAID
FOR
OUT
OF
GENERAL
FUNDS
LIKE
PHYSICALS
FOR
INSURANCE
POLICIES
SICK
NOTES
ELECTROLYSIS
ETC
THE
REASON
THAT
THE
CANADIAN
HEALTH
INSURANCE
HASNT
SPIRALLED
OUT
OF
CONTROL
DESPITE
BEING
OPEN
AND
UNIVERSAL
IS
THAT
UNLIKE
AMERICANS
THERE
IS
NO
URGE
TO
SPEND
ALL
OF
YOUR
BENEFITS
WORTH
AND
MORE
IF
YOU
CAN
WERE
A
DIFFERENT
CULTURE
LIKE
THE

MODEL
MANAGED

LEAVES
IN

TWO
ELEMENTS
OF
THE

THAT
REFORMERS
MOST
OFTEN
CRITICIZE
THE
PRIVATE

INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
AND
THE
EMPLOYERBASED
SYSTEM
OF

MANAGED

COMPELS

RELIES
ON

WHICH
ARE

APPROACH
AS
IN
FRANCE
AND
GERMANY
WITH
ALL
PRIVATE
DOCTORS
AND
BOTH
PRIVATE
AND
PUBLIC
HOSPITALS
IT
IS
ALL
PURE

WITHOUT

THE
DIVISIONS
ARE
DIFFERENT
WITH
THE
GERMANS
USING
A

OVER
A

ITS
NO

ALLINSURANCE
IS
THE
MOST
EXPENSIVE
WAY
TO
