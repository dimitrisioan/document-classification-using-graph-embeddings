magazine
see
bottom
march
the
singlepayer
model
sometimes
called
national
health
insurance
eliminates
private
insurance
companies
and
removes
health
care
from
employment
the
government
provides
free
health
care
to
all
us
residents
and
there
are
no
outofpocket
costs
wrong
in
better
ec
countries
that
use
pure
but
public
health
insurance
like
we
use
in
canada
rather
than
selfenclosed
hmolike
socialized
medicine
of
our
costs
comes
from
private
supplementary
insurance
andor
copayments
france
magazines
summer
edition
has
a
fantastic
presentation
of
their
basic
insurance
coverage
including
a
sample
chart
of
copayment
percentages
for
days
youre
covered
for
of
the
public
hospital
rate
afterward
with
extra
private
insurance
you
can
get
into
a
private
hospital
and
be
covered
for
any
differences
beyond
the
public
hospital
rate
the
public
insurance
covers
beyond
days
or
the
same
cash
amount
for
a
private
hospital
and
the
difference
is
paid
outofpocket
or
according
to
your
supplementary
private
insurance
over
of
french
have
some
form
of
extra
private
insurance
so
of
health
costs
in
europe
are
out
of
private
funds
and
not
gleaned
from
other
taxes
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
using
the
same
methods
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
that
the
french
had
deductibles
and
copayments
in
their
insurance
fund
is
to
their
credit
i
am
in
the
minority
for
advocating
such
back
in
canada
to
make
the
canadian
insurance
look
more
like
real
health
insurance
which
actually
it
is
the
new
reform
party
a
breakoff
of
traditionalists
from
the
conservatives
with
a
mildly
libertarian
faction
hold
our
public
health
insurance
as
an
untouchable
but
that
just
a
few
people
have
to
be
reminded
that
its
not
free
the
average
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscally
naive
than
their
american
counterparts
on
issues
like
these
im
one
of
the
few
people
who
favour
copayments
forget
about
leftists
even
our
conservatives
attack
me
for
it
on
the
canadian
newsgroups
to
make
it
look
more
like
real
insurance
cos
the
insurance
payment
is
hidden
unlike
in
france
and
if
you
didnt
know
it
youd
believe
it
actually
is
socialized
medicine
american
conservativeslibertarians
and
canadian
leftists
are
the
only
ones
who
seriously
call
it
that
canadians
arent
worried
about
the
americans
who
spend
were
worried
about
the
french
and
germans
who
spend
to
our
so
the
insurance
is
looking
at
things
that
shouldnt
be
paid
for
out
of
general
funds
like
physicals
for
insurance
policies
sick
notes
electrolysis
etc
the
reason
that
the
canadian
health
insurance
hasnt
spiralled
out
of
control
despite
being
open
and
universal
is
that
unlike
americans
there
is
no
urge
to
spend
all
of
your
benefits
worth
and
more
if
you
can
were
a
different
culture
like
the
play
or
pay
model
managed
competition
leaves
in
place
two
elements
of
the
current
health
care
system
that
reformers
most
often
criticize
the
private
forprofit
insurance
industry
and
the
employerbased
system
of
coverage
managed
competition
compels
employers
to
enroll
their
workers
in
large
pools
of
health
insurance
customers
entire
industries
may
for
example
sponsor
a
pool
or
network
insurance
companies
doctors
hospitals
and
other
health
care
providers
then
bid
for
the
pools
business
competing
in
theory
on
the
basis
of
price
and
quality
managed
care
relies
on
hmos
which
are
unknown
in
most
western
nations
that
use
only
public
health
insurance
like
canada
france
and
germany
im
canadian
and
my
german
fatherinlawtobe
says
of
hmonhs
approaches
we
left
that
behind
with
east
germany
sure
hmonhs
controls
costs
because
you
have
managers
strangling
doctors
with
budget
strings
in
canada
we
use
the
public
health
insurance
approach
as
in
france
and
germany
with
all
private
doctors
and
both
private
and
public
hospitals
it
is
all
pure
insurance
without
hmos
the
divisions
are
different
with
the
germans
using
a
couple
hundred
interlinked
sickness
funds
over
a
century
old
while
canada
divides
by
their
provinces
who
run
the
insurance
fund
and
set
local
fees
with
the
doctors
monopoly
federal
funds
cover
the
fees
disbursed
with
such
an
openended
system
its
no
surprise
that
canada
is
to
the
us
in
costs
allinsurance
is
the
most
expensive
way
to
go
the
french
and
germans
use
the
same
approach
but
have
larger
populations
in
more
compact
geography
to
improve
scales
of
economy
