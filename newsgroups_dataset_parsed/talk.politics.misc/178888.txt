clayton
cramer
writes
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
right
off
the
bat
this
information
is
flawed
most
throrough
im
sorry
but
masters
johnson
put
out
a
report
within
the
past
few
years
the
kinsey
institute
has
been
quite
active
since
it
was
founded
ohsomany
years
ago
they
too
recently
put
out
a
new
report
on
sexuality
i
was
quoting
a
news
story
i
have
no
idea
why
they
claim
this
was
the
most
through
examination
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
i
hate
to
be
picky
but
lets
do
the
math
if
we
take
the
cities
of
new
york
city
and
los
angeles
alone
we
can
find
approximately
million
gay
peoplemaking
about
million
gay
men
what
even
in
san
francisco
the
dept
of
public
health
estimates
that
only
of
the
male
population
is
gay
what
you
are
claiming
is
that
of
the
million
people
in
the
nyc
and
la
areas
that
more
than
are
gay
what
is
the
source
of
your
numbers
keep
in
mind
that
attempts
by
cdc
to
determine
homosexual
percentage
in
american
cities
have
given
numbers
of
the
american
male
population
is
about
million
so
what
this
study
says
is
that
all
gay
males
live
in
new
york
city
or
los
angeles
and
about
halfamillion
people
are
lying
about
being
gay
something
smells
funny
yes
your
million
number
smells
funny
