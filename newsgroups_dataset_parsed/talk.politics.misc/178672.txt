OKAY
BUT
DO
DOCTORS
WILLINGLY
TESTIFY
AGAINST
EACH
OTHER
IN
MALPRACTICE
CASES
WHEN
THEY
DO
GO
TO
COURT
OBVIOUSLY
ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL
TO
PROVE
MALPRACTICE
IT
USED
TO
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
GET
DOCTORS
HERE
TO
DO
THAT
A
POSSIBLE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
US
SYSTEM
YOU
WONT
HEAR
ABOUT
FROM
THE
AMA
OUR
DOCTORS
MONOPOLY
IS
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
AS
IN
THE
US
IF
NOT
MORE
POWERFUL
NOW
THAT
THEY
CAN
DICTATE
INSURANCE
PAYMENT
RATES
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
AN
ANSWER
TO
THIS
ONE
ANECDOTALLY
MY
FRIENDS
WHO
ARE
MDS
INCLUDING
MY
MAIN
BUDS
FROM
HIGH
SCHOOL
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
HARD
IT
IS
TO
TURN
STATES
WITNESS
AGAINST
SOMEONE
ELSE
NO
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
THERE
THOUGH
ALSO
IN
SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU
MAY
HAVE
TO
SUE
THE
INSURANCE
PLAN
PEOPLE
HERE
AFTER
ALL
SUE
HEALTH
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
ALL
THE
TIME
I
HEARD
ABOUT
A
GUY
IN
ALBERTA
WHO
CAME
DOWN
WITH
SOME
RARE
EYE
DISEASE
THAT
HE
HAD
TO
TAKE
REPEATED
TRIPS
TO
SEATTLE
TO
GET
TREATED
IT
COST
HIM
AND
HIS
FAMILY
SOMETHING
LIKE
AND
THE
PROVINCE
YEARS
LATER
STILL
HAS
ONLY
REIMBURSED
THEM
FOR
OR
SO
WELL
WHAT
AMERICAN
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
PLANS
COVER
TRAVEL
EXPENSES
SINCE
OUR
PUBLIC
INSURANCE
PLANS
ARE
PUBLICLY
ACCOUNTABLE
ONE
CAN
RAISE
A
STINK
IN
THE
MEDIA
TO
TRY
AND
EXTORT
BENEFITS
BEYOND
WHICH
ONE
IS
ENTITLED
HEY
NOT
ALBERTAS
FAULT
THAT
HE
LIVES
THERE
IF
HE
LIVED
IN
CHEYENNE
WY
HIS
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
WOULDVE
TOLD
HIM
TO
GO
TO
HELL
FOR
THE
TRAVEL
EXPENSES
AND
THATS
THAT
AN
HMO
WOULD
HAVE
JUST
KEPT
QUIET
AND
LET
HIM
GO
BLIND
WELL
YEAH
TELL
US
ABOUT
THE
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
MEDICAL
CENTRE
OUTSIDE
OTTAWA
IT
SERVES
THE
SAME
PURPOSE
AS
THE
BETHESDA
NAVAL
HOSPITAL
SINCE
NOT
ALL
HOSPITALS
CAN
PROVIDE
EVERYTHING
MAYBE
THEY
HAVE
SOME
STUFF
THAT
OTHERS
DONT
OTTAWAS
POPULATION
IS
ONLY
A
QUARTER
MILLION
IF
YOU
INCLUDE
THE
SURROUNDING
COUNTIES
MY
POINT
WAS
THAT
SOMETHING
THAT
SHOULD
NECESSARILY
REMAIN
UNPOLITICIZED
HAS
BECOME
VERY
POLITICIZED
TO
THE
DETRIMENT
OF
ITS
MISSION
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THIS
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
WITH
THE
DMC
THE
PROBLEM
IS
IN
A
SYSTEM
WHERE
HOSPITALS
ANNUAL
BUDGETS
ARE
APPROVED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
HOW
DO
YOU
KEEP
POLITICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
OUT
OF
MEDICAL
DECISIONS
I
BET
THAT
IF
YOURE
AN
MP
OR
MPP
OR
GOOD
FRIENDS
WITH
ONE
YOURE
PUT
ON
ANY
HOSPITALS
URGENT
CARE
LIST
NO
MATTER
HOW
MINOR
YOUR
PROBLEM
WHICH
IS
OK
UNLESS
YOURE
SOMEONE
WHO
GETS
BUMPED
OFF
THE
LIST
FOR
SOME
BIGSHOT
PEOPLE
OF
INFLUENCE
WILL
GET
THEIR
WAY
IN
ANY
SYSTEM
AMERICAN
OR
EUROPEAN
ITS
THE
GOLDEN
RULE
HE
WHO
HAS
THE
GOLD
MAKES
THE
RULES
BUT
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
DOES
IT
AFFECT
THE
SYSTEM
AND
WHY
IS
AN
URGENT
CARE
LIST
NECESSARY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
ITS
WORTH
THINKING
ABOUT
ITS
REGULAR
PRACTICE
IN
A
HOSPITAL
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHO
NEEDS
TO
GET
AT
WHAT
FACILITIES
DONT
AMERICANS
HAVE
TO
ARRANGE
IN
ADVANCE
FOR
OPERATIONS
TOO
I
THINK
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
STANDARDS
BEING
APPLIED
HERE
AND
THAT
CANADA
CANT
GIVE
BEVERLY
HILLSSTYLE
TREATMENT
TO
EVERYBODY
ITS
NOT
A
BIG
BROTHER
LIST
ITS
MORE
LIKE
CALLING
AROUND
TOWN
FOR
A
TABLE
FOR
DINNER
YEAH
BUT
PRIVATE
NONPROFIT
FOUNDATIONS
HAVE
TO
MAKE
MONEY
SOMEHOW
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
BUSINESS
YES
AND
THE
TORIES
IN
OTTAWA
ARE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
THEM
DO
THAT
RATHER
THAN
HOPE
FOR
A
BIGGER
GRANT
FROM
THE
FEDS
AND
THEIR
PROVINCE
THE
NEXT
TIME
AROUND
WHETHER
ITS
USING
MOP
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
LONGER
OR
EVEN
SELLING
SERVICES
TO
AMERICANS
REMEMBER
OUR
SYSTEM
IS
CASH
BASED
AND
SINCE
OUR
HEALTH
CARE
INFRASTRUCTURE
IS
OVERBUILT
EXCEPT
IN
SPECIALTIES
THAT
REQUIRE
LARGER
POPULATIONS
TO
GENERATE
BUSINESS
WHY
NOT
THE
ALTERNATIVE
IS
CLOSING
UNUSED
WARDS
BUSINESS
WHETHER
CANADIANS
WOULD
BE
THRILLED
AT
THE
PROSPECT
OF
THEIR
OWN
HEALTH
SERVICES
CATERING
TOWARD
AMERICANS
WHO
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
PAY
MORE
THAN
THEY
DO
IS
ANOTHER
ISSUE
ENTIRELY
IT
MUST
BE
NOTED
THAT
THEY
SAID
THEY
WERE
DOING
IT
PARTLY
BECAUSE
THEIR
GRANTS
FROM
THE
PROVINCE
WERE
GETTING
SMALLER
IF
THOSE
GRANTS
ARE
SO
INSUBSTANTIAL
WHY
THE
NEED
TO
ATTRACT
FOREIGNERS
TO
MAKE
UP
THE
DIFFERENCE
YOU
ANSWERED
THE
QUESTION
YOURSELF
PRIVATE
NONPROFIT
FOUNDATIONS
HAVE
TO
MAKE
MONEY
SOMEHOW
AND
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
ABOUT
TIME
THAT
THEY
ACTED
LIKE
THE
PRIVATE
HOSPITALS
THAT
THEY
ARE
PERSONALLY
IM
FED
UP
WITH
CANADIAN
SOCIALISTS
TRYING
TO
TELL
EVERYONE
THAT
THEIR
HEALTH
CARE
IS
FREE
WHEN
WE
ARE
ACTUALLY
BUYING
INSURANCE
THATS
ONE
AT
YOU
BOB
RAE
THE
GDP
FIGURES
ARE
COMBINED
PUBLIC
AND
PRIVATE
EXPENDITURES
FOR
TOTAL
OUTLAY
AND
ARE
COMPILED
USE
THE
SAME
METHODS
BY
THE
OECD
THAT
YIELD
THE
FIGURE
FOR
THE
US
BUT
DONT
THE
US
FIGURES
INCLUDE
DENTISTRY
AND
OPTOMETRY
WHERE
THE
CANADIAN
ONE
UNTIL
RECENTLY
ANYWAY
DIDNT
SINCE
WE
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
EVALUATED
IN
AN
OECD
STYLE
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
REMEMBER
OECD
COUNTS
BOTH
PRIVATE
AND
PUBLIC
FUNDS
AND
IN
CANADA
LIKE
FRANCE
AND
GERMANY
OF
HEALTH
CARE
SPENDING
IS
PRIVATE
FUNDS
IE
NOT
THE
BASIC
HEALTH
INSURANCE
MONEY
SO
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
THE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEMS
FINANCIALLY
COLLAPSE
HOW
THEY
ARE
COLLECTING
PREMIUMS
AND
IM
AN
ADVOCATE
OF
HAVING
COPAYMENTS
LIKE
THE
FRENCH
DO
IN
THEIR
SYSTEM
WELL
IF
YOU
SPEND
MORE
THAN
YOU
TAKE
IN
YOU
GO
BANKRUPT
ITS
THAT
SIMPLE
IF
THE
PROVINCIAL
INSURANCE
SYSTEMS
FIND
THEMSELVES
PAYING
OUT
MORE
THAN
THEY
GET
IN
REVENUE
THEY
WONT
BE
ABLE
TO
PAY
FOR
EVERYBODYS
PRIMARY
CARE
YES
THE
INFRASTRUCTURE
WILL
BE
THERE
BUT
WILL
EVERYBODY
BE
ABLE
TO
CONTINUE
USING
IT
AT
THE
SAME
RATE
MINOR
COPAYMENTS
CAN
FLUSH
OUT
ABUSERS
REMEMBER
THAT
OUR
SYSTEM
IS
ONLY
AN
INSURANCE
POLICY
BUT
OUR
COSTS
ARENT
RISING
FAST
ENOUGH
TO
ENSURE
ADEQUATE
COPAYMENTSDEDUCTIBLES
LAST
YEAR
QUEBECS
USERFEE
PROPOSAL
CAME
OUT
WITH
THE
NUMBER
OF
AS
THE
NECESSARY
HIKE
THAT
COULD
BE
DONE
THROUGH
A
COPAYMENT
RATHER
THAN
GIVE
THE
QMA
A
RAISE
AND
ITS
NOT
CONTRACT
TIME
YET
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
FROM
UPI
CLARINET
EVEN
THE
NEW
REFORM
PARTY
A
BREAKOFF
OF
TRADITIONALISTS
FROM
THE
CONSERVATIVES
WITH
A
MILDLY
LIBERTARIAN
FACTION
HOLDS
OUR
PUBLIC
HEALTH
INSURANCE
AS
AN
UNTOUCHABLE
BUT
THAT
JUST
A
FEW
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
BE
REMINDED
THAT
ITS
NOT
FREE
THE
AVERAGE
CANADIANEUROPEAN
IS
MORE
FISCALLY
NAIVE
THAN
THEIR
AMERICAN
COUNTERPARTS
ON
ISSUES
LIKE
THESE
BUT
NO
MENTION
OF
COPAYMENTS
ANYWHERE
TO
BE
SEEN
BUT
CUTTING
PUBLIC
SPENDING
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
AND
BRINGING
BACK
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
WITH
LITTLE
HASTE
IF
ELECTED
I
KNOW
THAT
FOR
PETES
SAKE
I
LIVE
RIGHT
ON
THE
BORDER
I
KNOW
THE
CANADIAN
SYSTEM
ISNT
SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE
UNLIKE
BRITAINS
NHS
SORRY
ITS
JUST
THAT
I
EVEN
RUN
INTO
PEOPLE
FROM
BUFFALO
AND
FROM
MICHIGAN
WHO
DONT
KNOW
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
MEANS
THAT
IF
THE
MONEY
RUNS
LOW
IN
THE
PLAN
YOURE
OUT
OF
LUCK
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
AFFORD
IT
YOURSELF
YEAH
BUT
THERED
BE
A
LOT
OF
LEADTIME
AND
A
HEALTHCARE
CRISIS
THAT
WOULD
PRECLUDE
IT
IF
PROVINCIAL
GOVERNMENTS
AS
BAD
AS
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
HECK
WE
HAVE
THE
NDP
CLEANING
UP
A
SPENDING
MESS
MADE
BY
THE
CONSERVATIVES
IN
SASKATCHEWAN
EMBARASSING
CAN
BE
SO
IRRESPONSIBLE
THERE
IS
STILL
REALLOCATION
HEALTH
INSURANCE
IS
SO
IMPORTANT
THAT
ITS
ABOUT
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
CAN
INSPIRE
OPEN
REBELLION
AND
VIOLENT
INSURRECTION
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
HOCKEY
RINK
RIGHT
NOW
ATTEMPTS
TO
GET
THE
SYSTEM
AND
ITS
USERS
TO
LEARN
GOOD
HABITS
ARE
BEING
TREATED
LIKE
CODLIVER
OIL
WOULD
THE
PRIVATE
INSURERS
TAKE
UP
THE
SLACK
THEYD
BE
UNDER
NO
OBLIGATION
TO
OF
COURSE
THEY
COULD
EVENTUALLY
MAKE
MONEY
AGAIN
BUT
IF
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
TRUE
THEYD
BE
LOATHE
TO
DO
SO
AND
OUT
OF
PRACTICE
IN
HANDLING
SUCH
BASIC
SERVICES
TOO
SOME
OF
THE
COMPANIES
PROVIDING
EXTRA
INSURANCE
ARE
SUBSIDIARIES
OF
AMERICAN
COMPANIES
AND
THEIR
PARENTS
PROVIDE
FULL
INSURANCE
DOWN
HERE
REGARDLESS
ALL
FIRMS
UP
NORTH
CAN
EASILY
TURN
ON
CABLE
TV
TO
SEE
HOW
WELL
THE
AMERICAN
FIRMS
ARE
DOING
BY
BEING
INVOLVED
IN
BASIC
COVERAGE
THE
PRIVATE
FIRMS
ARE
MAKING
TOO
MUCH
MONEY
AFTER
HAVING
GOTTEN
RID
OF
BASIC
COVERAGE
THEY
RUN
AROUND
PATTING
THEM
SELVES
ON
THE
BACK
FOR
THEIR
OWN
COOPERATION
IN
PROVIDING
EXTRAS
FOR
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO
DESERVE
IT
YEAH
BUT
EVENTUALLY
ITS
GOING
TO
CREATE
A
KIND
OF
TWOTIERED
EFFECT
THAT
WILL
BE
NOTICEABLE
AFTER
A
WHILE
LIKE
IN
BRITAIN
MOST
AMERICANS
ARE
FEARFUL
OF
A
SINGLETIER
SYSTEM
SERIOUSLY
THERE
ARE
FEW
AREAS
THAT
HAVE
SUFFICIENT
POPULATION
FOR
A
TWOMORETIERED
SYSTEM
LIKE
WHAT
THE
FRENCH
HAVE
A
HEALTH
POLICY
PROF
DG
SHEA
HAS
CITED
STUDIES
IN
THE
NEJM
THAT
INDICATE
HAVING
A
POPULATION
OF
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
ADEQUATE
COMPETITION
AND
IN
CANADA
THERE
ARE
ONLY
FOUR
CITIES
WEST
OF
THE
GREAT
LAKES
WITH
THAT
POPULATION
OR
LARGER
ANYWAYS
THE
NUMBERS
SHOW
THAT
COSTS
HAVE
HELD
STEADIER
THAN
THOSE
IN
THE
US
AND
BARRING
ANY
FUTURE
CHERNOBYLLIKE
CRISIS
SUDDEN
TRANSIENTS
IN
SPENDING
ARE
UNLIKELY
IN
FACT
THE
HEALTH
ALLOCATION
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
WELLBEHAVED
SECTORS
OF
SPENDING
UP
NORTH
SO
ANY
TALK
OF
BANKRUPTCY
IS
TALKRADIO
FODDER
FAR
AWAY
FROM
THE
BORDER
IF
THE
PROVINCES
HIT
FISCAL
ROUGH
SPOTS
AND
HAVE
TO
CUT
BACK
THE
THINGS
PRIVATE
INSURERS
HAVE
TO
OFFER
WILL
SEEM
LESS
AND
LESS
LIKE
LUXURIES
AND
THE
GAP
WILL
BE
MORE
AND
MORE
NOTICEABLE
THIS
WONT
BE
OVERNIGHT
AND
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
WOULD
FORCE
CANADA
TO
HAVE
A
SYSTEM
MORE
LIKE
THE
FRENCH
ONE
BUT
THATS
NOT
A
BAD
THING
AND
THE
CHANGE
WILL
BE
MINIMAL
IE
ADD
COPAYMENTS
AND
FRUSTRATE
