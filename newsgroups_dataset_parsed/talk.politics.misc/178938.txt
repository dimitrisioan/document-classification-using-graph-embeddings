TIM
SMITH
WRITES
DEMONDESIREWRIGHTEDU
NOT
A
BOOMER
WRITES
A
JUDGE
DENIED
GMS
NEW
TRIAL
MOTION
EVEN
THOUGH
GM
SAYS
IT
HAS
TWO
NEW
WITNESSES
THAT
SAID
THE
OCCUPANT
OF
THE
TRUCK
WAS
DEAD
FROM
THE
IMPACT
NOT
FROM
THE
FIRE
THOUGHTS
HOW
CAN
A
WITNESS
TELL
THAT
SOMEONE
IN
A
BURNING
TRUCK
IS
DEAD
RATHER
THAN
UNCONSCIOUS
THEIR
TESTIMONY
WOULD
BE
A
CONTRADICTION
OF
THE
PLAINTIFFS
CHARGE
AND
WITNESS
THAT
THE
OCCUPANT
MOVED
AFTER
THE
IMPACT
INDICATING
HE
WAS
ALIVE
AND
TRYING
TO
GET
OUT
AND
PROVOKING
ALL
SORTS
OF
SYMPATHETIC
GROSS
BURNED
ALIVE
REACTIONS
ITS
KIND
OF
SCARY
WHEN
YOU
REALIZE
THAT
JUDGES
ARE
GOING
TO
START
DENYING
NEW
TRIALS
EVEN
WHEN
NEW
EVIDENCE
THAT
CONTRADICTS
THE
FACTS
THAT
LED
TO
THE
PREVIOUS
RULING
APPEAR
OR
HAS
THE
JUDGE
DECIDED
THAT
THE
NEW
WITNESSES
ARE
NOT
TO
BE
BELIEVED
SHOULDNT
THAT
BE
UP
TO
A
JURY
WHAT
KIND
OF
WITNESSES
IF
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
WITNESSES
WHO
WERE
AT
THE
ACCIDENT
OR
WERE
OTHERWISE
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
EG
PARAMEDICS
EMERGENCY
ROOM
DOCTORS
ETC
THEN
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
USED
AT
THE
FIRST
TRIAL
YOU
DONT
GET
A
NEW
TRIAL
BECAUSE
YOU
SCREWED
UP
AND
FORGOT
TO
CALL
ALL
OF
YOUR
WITNESSES
THEY
ARE
TWO
WITNESSES
WHO
DIDNT
COME
FORTH
UNTIL
AFTER
THE
FIRST
TRIAL
WHILE
IT
WOULD
BE
TOUGH
LUCK
FOR
GM
IF
THEY
NEW
ABOUT
THESE
WITNESSES
BEFOREHAND
IMO
THIS
CONSTITUTES
NEW
EVIDENCE
IF
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
NEW
EXPERT
WITNESSES
WHO
WILL
OFFER
NEW
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
DATA
NOTE
THAT
THE
LOSER
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
SUCH
WITNESSES
IF
THIS
WERE
GROUNDS
FOR
A
NEW
TRIAL
THEN
THE
LOSER
COULD
ALWAYS
GET
A
NEW
TRIAL
AND
KEEP
DOING
SO
UNTIL
THE
LOSER
BECOMES
A
WINNER
AND
THEN
THE
OTHER
SIDE
WOULD
COME
UP
WITH
NEW
EXPERT
WITNESSES
NO
I
SUPPORT
RULINGS
THAT
DENY
NEW
TRIALS
ON
THOSE
GROUNDS
BRETT
THERES
NOTHING
SO
PASSIONATE
AS
A
VESTED
INTEREST
DISGUISED
AS
AN
INTELLECTUAL
CONVICTION
