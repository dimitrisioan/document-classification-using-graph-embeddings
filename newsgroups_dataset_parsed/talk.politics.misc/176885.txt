HERE
IS
A
PRESS
RELEASE
FROM
THE
CALIFORNIA
DEPARTMENT
OF
INSURANCE
CALIFORNIA
INSURANCE
COMMISSIONER
ENDORSES
FEDERAL
LEGISLATION
TO
PROTECT
CONSUMERS
FROM
SCAM
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
I
MAY
BE
A
LITTLE
DENSE
BUT
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
PROTECTING
CONSUMERS
FROM
SCAM
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
WOULD
BE
THE
PRIME
OBJECTIVE
OF
SOMETHING
CALLED
THE
CAL
INSURANCE
COMMISSION
IF
THEY
ARENT
ACCOMPLISHING
THAT
NOW
THEN
WHY
DO
WE
NEED
THEM
VERY
SIMPLE
AN
INSURANCE
COMMISSIONER
IS
A
BUREAUCRAT
A
REGULATOR
IT
IS
HISHER
DUTIES
TO
MAKE
RULES
TO
ENFORCE
LAWS
HESHE
CANNOT
MAKE
LAWS
IF
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
THAT
COVERS
A
SPECIFIC
SUBJECT
SAY
SCAM
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
A
REGULATOR
CANNOT
CREATE
ONE
SO
THEY
HAVE
TO
GO
TO
A
PROPER
LEGISLATIVE
BODY
TO
GET
SUCH
A
LAW
ENACTED
FOR
THE
CALIFORNIA
INSURANCE
COMMISSIONER
THERE
ARE
TWO
POSSIBLE
LEGISLATIVE
BODIES
THE
CALIFORNIA
STATE
LEGISLATURE
AND
THE
US
CONGRESS
WE
ALL
KNOW
HOW
LITTLE
THE
CALIFORNIA
STATE
LEGISLATURE
ACCOMPLISHES
ESP
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
INSURANCE
REFORM
LEGISLATION
NEGATIVE
MOVEMENT
SO
GARAMENDI
WANTS
THE
FEDS
TO
DO
IT
BECAUSE
A
HE
HAS
A
BETTER
CHANCE
OF
GETTING
A
FEDERAL
LAW
THROUGH
AND
B
SINCE
MANY
OF
THE
SCAM
COMPANIES
WORK
ACROSS
STATE
LINESNATIONAL
BORDERS
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
HAVE
A
LAW
THAT
REACH
OUT
INTO
OTHER
JURISDICTIONS
