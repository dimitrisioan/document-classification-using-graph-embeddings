CRITISISM
IS
TOO
EASY
WHAT
SOLUTIONS
DO
PEOPLE
HAVE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BETTER
THAN
WHAT
THE
FBI
HAD
BEEN
DOING
FOR
THE
LAST
FEW
MONTHS
FIRSTLY
THEY
COULD
HAVE
BACKED
OFF
REGARDLESS
OF
WHO
WAS
AT
FAULT
IN
THE
FIRST
ASSAULT
THE
ONE
IN
WHICH
FOUR
ATF
OFFICERS
DIED
ONCE
THAT
WAS
OVER
BACKING
OFF
WAS
NO
LONGER
AN
OPTION
THE
PEOPLE
INSIDE
PARTICULARLY
KORESH
WERE
CRIMINAL
SUSPECTS
THEY
COULD
HAVE
MADE
A
CASE
OF
SELFDEFENSE
IF
THEY
WANTED
IN
A
COURT
OF
LAW
UNTIL
THEN
THE
POLICE
HAD
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
CAPTURE
AND
ARREST
THEM
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
A
CASE
WHERE
THE
POLICE
KNEW
THERE
WAS
A
CRIMINAL
SUSPECT
IN
A
BUILDING
AND
STILL
DECIDED
TO
BACK
OFF
CONTINUING
THE
SIEGE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
ALTERNATIVES
TO
WHAT
ACTUALLY
TOOK
PLACE
AND
ITS
A
MATTER
OF
DEBATE
WHETHER
ANY
OF
THESE
WOULD
HAVE
ENDED
ANY
BETTER
HOW
ABOUT
LETTING
IN
THE
PRESS
HOW
ABOUT
LETTING
KORESH
OUT
TO
TALK
TO
THE
PRESS
MAYBE
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
ALLOWED
TO
TALK
WITH
THE
PRESSTV
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
DAYS
HE
WOULD
HAVE
SURRENDERED
PEACEFULLY
HOW
ABOUT
LETTING
THE
RELATIVES
OF
KORESHS
FOLLOWERS
TALK
SEEMS
TO
ME
WHEN
YOU
ISOLATE
SOMEONE
TRY
TO
SEND
THEM
CRAZY
BY
PLAYING
LOUDSPEAKERS
THROUGH
THE
NIGHT
OF
TIBETAN
CHANTS
ETC
YOU
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
TO
STAND
ON
WHEN
THEY
BEHAVE
AS
IF
THEY
ARE
CRAZY
IM
NOT
TOO
SURE
OF
THEIR
SANITY
TO
START
WITH
I
AM
VERY
SUSPICIOUS
WHEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
CONTROLS
ALL
COMMUNICATION
AND
SENDS
THE
PRESS
MILES
AWAY
I
HAVE
A
GUT
FEELING
THAT
NOKNOCK
WARRANT
WHICH
IS
SEALED
WOULD
NOT
STAND
UP
TO
SCRUTINY
I
DONT
THINK
NOKNOCK
WARRANTS
ARE
WHAT
THE
CONSTITUTION
WRITERS
HAD
IN
MIND
WHEN
THEY
GAVE
US
RIGHTS
AGAINST
IMPROPER
SEARCH
AND
SEIZURE
I
DONT
THINK
AN
ALLPOWERFUL
CENTRAL
HIGHTAXING
GOVERNMENT
WAS
WHAT
THE
CONSTITUTION
WRITERS
HAD
IN
MIND
WHEN
IT
DELAGATED
RIGHTS
TO
THE
CITIZENS
AND
STATES
AND
RESTRICTED
CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT
