WE
ALREADY
KILL
PEOPLE
DEATH
PENALTY
AND
THAT
COSTS
EVEN
MORE
MONEY
SO
YOU
COULD
AS
WELL
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THIS
EXTREMELY
BARBARIC
WAY
OF
JUSTICE
BUT
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
IS
RIGHT
AND
HOW
EXPENSIVE
CAN
AN
EXECUTION
BE
I
MEAN
I
THINK
ROPE
CYANIDE
FOR
THE

OR
THE
RIFLES

AMMUNITION

IN

OH
SURE
THE

PENALTY
IS
FAIRLY
INEXPENSIVE
BUT
THE
TRIAL

CAN
RUN
MILLIONS
THATS
ASSUMING
OUR

PUPPY
IS
WILLING
TO

AND
WHY

HELL
WOULD
I
WASTE
MY

DOING
THAT
TO
A
CONVICTED
CRIMINAL
GETTING
A
DEATH
SENTENCE
GO
DIRECTLY

DO
NOT

GO

HEY
PUPPY
YOU
ARE

BUT
I
WOULDNT

EVERYONE
