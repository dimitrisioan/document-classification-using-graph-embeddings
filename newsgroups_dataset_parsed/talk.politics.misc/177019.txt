we
already
kill
people
death
penalty
and
that
costs
even
more
money
so
you
could
as
well
complain
about
this
extremely
barbaric
way
of
justice
but
the
death
penalty
is
right
and
how
expensive
can
an
execution
be
i
mean
i
think
rope
cyanide
for
the
gas
or
the
rifles
and
ammunition
to
arm
firing
squads
are
affordable
now
perhaps
lethal
injection
might
be
expensive
in
that
case
lets
return
to
the
more
efficient
methods
employed
in
the
past
oh
sure
the
death
penalty
is
fairly
inexpensive
but
the
trial
and
sentencing
can
run
millions
thats
assuming
our
attack
puppy
is
willing
to
grant
people
trials
in
his
new
order
and
why
the
hell
would
i
waste
my
time
doing
that
to
a
convicted
criminal
getting
a
death
sentence
go
directly
to
hell
do
not
pass
go
do
not
collect
judge
laughing
hey
puppy
you
are
getting
further
around
the
bend
every
day
but
i
wouldnt
miss
your
adolescent
ravings
for
the
world
everyone
needs
a
good
laugh
now
and
then
