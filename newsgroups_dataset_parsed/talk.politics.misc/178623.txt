re
welcome
to
police
state
usa
in
article
writes
the
above
conveniently
ignores
the
murder
of
four
batf
agents
by
the
branch
davidians
in
an
unprovoked
ambush
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a
warant
on
the
place
by
ludicrously
underarmed
and
unprotected
police
wait
a
second
youre
ignoring
major
facts
here
there
was
no
attempt
to
simply
serve
a
warrant
the
batf
had
a
noknock
warrant
the
initial
firefight
began
when
the
batf
threw
concussion
grenades
at
the
building
batf
admits
this
if
anyone
on
the
net
cares
to
suggest
a
sure
fire
method
of
bringing
the
murderes
of
four
police
officers
to
justice
perhaps
we
could
hear
it
lets
be
realistic
here
shall
we
youre
a
member
of
a
rather
paranoid
religious
organization
someone
comes
to
your
building
dressed
in
black
suits
carrying
firearms
they
throw
a
concussion
grenade
at
the
place
and
try
to
break
in
what
exactly
are
you
going
to
do
i
would
not
allow
anyone
to
enter
my
home
without
first
identifying
themselves
if
someone
attacks
my
home
by
firing
weapons
or
throwing
explosive
i
think
id
be
entirely
justified
in
defending
myself
regardless
of
what
i
think
of
the
bds
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
were
guilty
of
firearms
violations
this
is
not
the
way
you
treat
people
in
a
supposedly
free
society
mc
mark

we
the
people
are
getting
tired
of
your
lies
univ

now
believe
that
