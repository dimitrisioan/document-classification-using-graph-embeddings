re
only
month
a
alan
brock
orange
county
register
editorial
titled
a
case
for
repealing
the
income
tax
got
my
attention
some
quotes
a
tax
on
income
because
of
the
flexible
definition
of
that
concept
invites
the
government
to
snoop
into
every
nook
and
cranny
of
our
lives
encouraging
people
to
snoop
on
one
another
and
report
transgressions
against
the
almighty
state
which
most
americans
deplored
in
nazi
or
communist
regimes
although
most
americans
paid
no
income
tax
at
all
years
ago
withholding
began
only
during
world
war
ii
as
a
temporary
exigency
and
in
the
median
family
federal
income
tax
was
last
year
the
federal
government
got
only
percent
of
its
income
from
income
taxes
how
long
ago
was
it
that
the
federal
government
somehow
managed
to
stagger
along
on
percent
of
its
revenue
would
you
believe
five
the
income
tax
has
converted
a
free
people
into
a
society
of
the
fearful
and
the
snitches
