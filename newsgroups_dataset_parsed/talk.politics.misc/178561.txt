and
now
those
other
options
dont
exist
we
probably
agree
on
this
more
than
you
thinkwelfare
was
invented
to
solve
a
problem
of
the
but
the
poverty
is
now
so
much
worse
and
our
economic
infra
structure
has
been
so
eroded
that
it
just
cant
keep
up
any
more
you
mean
since
your
philosophy
took
over
the
economy
has
almost
collapsed
excuse
me
my
philosophy
you
dont
have
any
idea
what
my
philosophy
is
the
american
economy
has
had
its
ups
and
downs
through
a
number
of
prevailing
economic
philosophies
but
then
economics
is
hardly
a
science
in
my
lifetime
your
philosophy
socialism
masquerading
as
a
liberal
welfare
state
has
been
in
ascendancy
no
i
mean
exactly
what
i
wrotethe
welfare
system
of
the
new
deal
is
wholly
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
current
state
of
affairs
absolutely
so
the
response
of
socialists
is
take
us
even
further
into
socialism
whether
or
not
the
fathers
work
is
not
germane
to
single
mothers
very
true
but
the
promotion
of
casual
sexuality
is
something
that
plays
a
part
in
the
single
mother
problem
ill
buy
thatand
theres
lots
of
reasons
for
it
extremely
far
down
on
the
list
being
the
flashinthepan
media
attention
a
bunch
of
middle
class
dropouts
got
for
their
philosophy
and
experimentation
flashinthepan
no
your
subculture
has
utterly
dominated
the
tv
and
movie
industries
for
two
decades
now
my
subculture
my
were
getting
personal
the
only
subculture
i
see
dominating
the
tv
and
movie
industries
is
money
if
youll
buy
it
theyll
sell
it
and
as
recent
movements
to
boycott
tv
advertisers
have
shown
theyre
very
sensitive
about
what
sells
whatever
happened
to
personal
responsibility
anyway
or
am
i
personally
responsible
for
the
decline
in
that
too
to
the
extent
that
people
have
been
encouraged
to
not
be
responsible
for
themselves
yes
come
on
you
and
i
both
know
that
the
major
problem
of
this
society
today
isnt
a
lack
of
employment
its
a
lack
of
people
willing
to
work
huh
tell
that
to
the
single
mother
i
know
who
was
laid
off
from
her
job
at
a
hospital
and
now
works
fulltime
minimum
wage
jobs
to
barely
be
able
to
support
herself
and
her
kid
barely
hey
shes
too
proud
to
go
on
public
assistance
but
the
only
jobs
she
can
find
are
menial
and
with
no
benefits
and
no
career
path
eitherthey
find
excuses
to
lay
people
off
and
hire
new
ones
rather
than
give
raises
and
perks
and
why
not
its
a
lot
cheaper
oddly
enough
all
the
unskilled
or
semiskilled
people
i
know
manage
to
find
employment
almost
immediately
maybe
she
needs
to
move
to
a
cheaper
part
of
the
country
where
jobs
are
plentiful
and
the
cost
of
living
is
lower
the
west
side
of
chicago
is
about
as
cheap
as
it
getssqualor
city
tell
me
about
all
these
places
where
its
cheap
to
live
and
jobs
are
abundantill
pass
them
on
sonoma
county
you
live
in
a
strange
and
wondrous
place
sir
inexpensive
housing
not
exactly
cheap
but
not
los
angeles
either
lots
of
employment
and
utterly
surrounded
by
socialists
well
i
suppose
thats
the
sort
of
environment
that
would
attract
socialists
or
at
least
not
dissuade
them
no
its
that
areas
with
a
lot
of
wealthy
breed
socialists
all
the
spoiled
rich
kids
feeling
guilty
about
their
wealth
but
not
guilty
enough
to
give
it
away
they
just
look
for
politicians
to
take
my
more
limited
wealth
away
i
see
a
lot
of
people
willingnay
eagerto
work
what
i
dont
see
is
a
system
that
makes
it
at
all
feasible
to
do
so
its
not
just
welfare
which
nobody
enjoys
but
there
just
arent
the
jobs
any
more
when
the
us
was
expanding
industrial
capacity
there
was
always
a
mill
to
go
work
inskills
to
learn
a
future
now
theres
only
mcdonalds
odd
not
the
experience
of
anyone
i
know
just
the
opposite
in
california
yup
mr
cramer
i
was
there
hippiedom
was
a
very
lowbudget
operation
our
drugs
were
cheap
the
money
i
was
referring
to
was
aid
to
families
with
druggie
cohabitators
afdc
well
i
doubt
that
much
of
this
goes
to
drugsthere
isnt
much
left
after
buying
food
and
there
is
very
little
in
the
first
place
sure
you
read
about
such
cases
now
and
then
but
thats
what
makes
them
news
show
me
your
statistics
about
afdc
abuse
i
can
tell
you
that
relatives
i
have
known
the
drugs
came
first
the
food
was
secondary
