it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
feel
this
way
in
the
first
place
constant
combat
isnt
particularly
conducive
to
intellectual
theorizing
also
they
tend
to
get
invaded
before
they
can
come
to
anything
like
a
stable
society
anyway
and
the
reason
that
the
soviet
union
couldnt
achieve
the
ideal
of
pure
communism
was
the
hostility
of
surrounding
capitalist
nationsuh
huh
somehow
this
all
sounds
familiar
once
again
utopian
dreams
are
confronted
by
the
real
world

youre
the
one
who
suggested
that
a
failed
government
should
be
an
ideal
proving
ground
i
never
felt
that
way
in
the
first
place
quite
the
contrary
i
think
a
better
proving
ground
would
be
someplace
that
already
had
a
governemnt
that
would
prevent
outright
acts
of
agression
yet
had
a
strong
spirit
of
individualism
and
initiative
someplace
like
texas
