IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
A
SOCIETY
WITH
A
FAILED
GOVERNMENT
WOULD
BE
AN
IDEAL
SETTING
FOR
LIBERTARIAN
IDEALS
TO
BE
IMPLEMENTED
NOW
WHY
DO
YOU
SUPPOSE
THAT
NEVER
SEEMS
TO
OCCUR
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
WHY
YOU
SHOULD
FEEL
THIS
WAY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
CONSTANT
COMBAT
ISNT
PARTICULARLY
CONDUCIVE
TO
INTELLECTUAL
THEORIZING
ALSO
THEY
TEND
TO
GET
INVADED
BEFORE
THEY
CAN
COME
TO
ANYTHING

YOURE

I
NEVER

IN

QUITE
THE

I
THINK
A
BETTER
PROVING
GROUND
WOULD
BE
SOMEPLACE
THAT
ALREADY
HAD
A

THAT
WOULD
PREVENT
OUTRIGHT
ACTS
OF
AGRESSION
YET
HAD
A
STRONG
SPIRIT
OF
INDIVIDUALISM
AND
INITIATIVE
SOMEPLACE
LIKE
