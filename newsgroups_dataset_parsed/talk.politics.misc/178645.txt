CHRISHOLTNEWCASTLEACUK
CHRIS
HOLT
WRITES
SO
WE
TRY
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
PROCESS
OF
DECIDING
WHETHER
TO
INTRODUCE
THIRD
PARTIES
ISNT
RANDOM
AS
STEVE
SAID
ABOVE
THERE
ARE
EXAMPLES
WHERE
THIRD
PARTIES
ARE
LESS
IGNORANT
OR
CORRUPT
THAN
THE
TWO
PRIMARY
PARTIES
SHOULD
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
HELP
OF
COURSE
IT
HELPS
BUT
ONLY
IF
THE
DECISION
TO
INVOLVE
THIRD
PARTIES
IS
THE
PRIMARY
PARTIS
TO
MAKE
A
CORRUPT
AND
IGNORANT
THIRD
PARTY
ISNT
GOING
TO
SAY
WERE
CORRUPT
AND
IGNORANT
WELL
STAY
OUT
OF
THIS
POINTING
OUT
THAT
THEY
ARE
CORRUPT
AND
IGNORANT
WONT
HELP
THEY
EITHER
WONT
BELIEVE
YOU
OR
WONT
CARE
ITS
IMPOSSIBLE
OR
AT
LEAST
BEYOND
MY
ABILITIES
TO
FORMULATE
A
RULE
THAT
WILL
ALWAYS
TELL
WHETHER
THE
INVOLVEMENT
OF
A
THIRD
PARTY
WOULD
BE
GOOD
OR
BAD
BUT
THERES
ONE
THAT
SEEMS
BETTER
THAN
ANY
OTHER
IVE
EVER
HEARD
SUGGESTED
VOLUNTARY
GOOD
MANDATORY
BAD
THAT
IS
A
THIRD
PARTY
SHOULD
INVOLVE
ITSELF
IN
A
TRANSACTION
ONLY
AT
THE
REQUEST
OF
THE
PRIMARY
PARTICIPANTS
SO
WE
DONT
FORMULATE
A
RULE
THAT
WILL
ALWAYS
TELL
WE
TRY
TO
USE
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
OTHER
PROPERTIES
OF
SITUATIONS
TO
SOME
OF
US
IT
APPEARS
THAT
TRYING
ALWAYS
TO
APPLY
VOLUNTARY
GOOD
MANDATORY
BAD
IS
NOT
ONLY
LESS
THAN
OPTIMAL
IT
IS
IN
SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES
SERIOUSLY
DAMAGING
THE
INTERESTING
QUESTION
IS
TO
CHARACTERIZE
THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES
AS
BEST
WE
CAN
LOOK
SOMEBODY
HAS
TO
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
DECIDE
WHETHER
A
THIRD
PARTY
WILL
REGULATE
YOUR
TRANSACTIONS
OR
NOT
THAT
SOMEBODY
IS
GOING
TO
BE
EITHER
YOU
OR
THE
THIRD
PARTY
YOU
CAN
ARGUE
UNTIL
YOU
ARE
BLUE
IN
THE
FACE
THAT
REGULATORS
SHOULDNT
GET
INVOLVED
IN
FACT
PEOPLE
HAVE
TRIED
THIS
THEY
WONT
LISTEN
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
QUESTION
YOU
HAVE
TO
ASK
IS
WHOSE
DECISION
IS
IT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
TO
INVOLVE
REGULATORS
OURS
OR
THEIRS
AFTER
YOUVE
ANSWERED
THED
FIRST
QUESTION
YOU
CAN
TRY
TO
MOVE
ON
TO
SUCH
QUESTIONS
AS
SHOULD
REGULATORS
BE
INVOLVED
AND
IF
SO
WHAT
REGULATIONS
ARE
APPROPRIATE
ALTHOUGH
WITH
YOUR
ANSWER
TO
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
THE
SECOND
AND
THIRD
ARE
TAKEN
OUT
OF
YOUR
HANDS

GRINCH
