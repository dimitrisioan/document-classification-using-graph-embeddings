THE
MEDIAN
OF
A
DISTRIBUTION
IS
THAT
VARIATEVALUE
WHICH
DIVIDES
THE
DISTRIBUTION
HALFWAY
IE
OF
THE
DISTRIBUTION
POPULATION
HAVE
LOWER
AND
HALF
HAVE
HIGHER
VARIATEVALUES
SO
FOR
MALES
THE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
HALF
OF
THESE
MEN
ARE
HIGHER
THAN
THIS
AND
HALF
ARE
LOWER
THAN
THIS
NOW
IF
THE
POPULATION
SAMPLE
SIZE
IS
AND
OF
THEM
ARE
GAY
MALES
ARE
GAY
IF
WE
SAY
THEY
ARE
DISTRIBUTED
EQUALLY
THEN
ONLY
ARE
GREATER
THAN
SEXUAL
PARTNERS
OF
COURSE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
HETEROSEXUAL
MEN
ARE
GREATER
THAN
NOT
QUITE
FIRST
THE
MEDIAN
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THAT
HALF
OF
THE
MEN
ARE
ABOVE
AND
HALF
BELOW
IT
SIMPLY
MEANS
THAT
IS
THE
MIDPOINT
BETWEEN
THE
MAXIMUM
NUMBER
OF
PARTNERS
AND
THE
MINIMUM
WHICH
IS
MOST
LIKELY
ZERO
HOWEVER
ASSUMING
YOUR
IMPLICATION
TO
BE
MOREORLESS
CORRECT
YOUR
FINAL
RESULT
IS
STILL
INVALID
IF
OF
ALL
MALES
HAVE
HAD
MORE
THAN
PARTNERS
AND
YOU
DEDUCT
THE
ASSUMED
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
MALES
WHAT
REMAINS
IS
NOT
BUT
STILL
OF
ALL
HETEROSEXUAL
MALES
WHICH
IS
TO
SAY
HEY
WERE
ALL
HUMAN
GARISON
