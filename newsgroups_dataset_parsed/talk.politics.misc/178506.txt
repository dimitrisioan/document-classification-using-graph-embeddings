WHINING
ABOUT

CANDIDATE
CLINTON
PROMISED
TO
TAX
THE
RICH
AND
MOST
FOLKS
THOUGHT
THAT
WAS
A
PRETTY
NIFTY
IDEA
THEN
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
SAID
HE
WANTED
FAMILIES
WHO
MAKE
MORE
THAN
TO
BEAR
OF
THE
NEW
TAX
BURDEN
AND
MANY
WERE
QUICK
TO
COMPLAIN
THAT
THEIR
SIXFIGURE
INCOME
DOES
NOT
MAKE
THEM
ONE
OF
THE
WELLTODO
ITS
PARTICULARLY
IRONIC
TO
ME
THAT
ITS
IN
THOSE
TRADITIONALLY
LIBERAL
ENCLAVES
OF
THE
BAY
AREA
AND
ACADEMIA
WHERE
THE
WEALTHY
ARE
STRUGGLING
SO
TO
FIT
THEMSELVES
INTO
THE
MANTLE
OF
JUST
REGULAR
WORKINGCLASS
FOLK
NOBODY
WILL
EVER
ADMIT
TO
BEING
RICH
EVERYBODYS
MIDDLE

SO
WHO
ARE
THE

WELL
ILL
THROW
OUT

THAT

US
AND
THAT
IS
WHAT
TENURED
PROFESSORS
CAN
EXPECT
TO
MAKE
FOR
A
PHD
WITH

IS
A

LESS
THAN
WHAT

THAT

AND
IS
HARDLY

ITS
WELL
ABOVE
THE

INCOME
FOR
THE

BAY

AVERAGE
HOUSEHOLD
INCOME
IS
IN
THE
RANGE
NATIONAL

IS
THE

HAS
NEARLY
TWICE
THE

OF

VS
THE

HERE
MAY
BE
HIGH
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
ITS

I
DOUBT
THAT
THE

IS
ALL
THAT
DIFFERENT
IT
WOULD
APPEAR
THAT
THIS
DEFINITION
OF
MODEST
IS
PERHAPS
A
BIT
IMMODERATE
SO
WHAT
THEYRE
NO
CHEAPER
FOR
THOSE
WHO
ARE
GAINFULLY
EMPLOYED
IN
CALIFORNIA
IS
NOT
UPPERMIDDLECLASS
IT
DEPENDS
UPON
YOUR
DEFINITION
ITS
CLEARLY
ABOVE
AVERAGE
IT
IS
MORE
THAN
WHAT
TWOTHIRDS
OF
CALIFORNIA
HOUSEHOLDS
MAKE
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
BELONGING
TO
THE
UPPER
ONETHIRD
IS
NOT
AN
UNREASONABLE
DEFINITION
OF
UPPERMIDDLECLASS
NOTE
THAT
IF
THAT
PROFESSORS
SPOUSE

THEY
BECOME
ONE
OF
