MR

STEVE
HENDRICKS
WRITES
OF
COURSE
ONE
AGAIN
FACES
THE
QUESTION
OF
HOW
ONE
CIRCUMSCRIBES
GOVERNMENT
POWER
AND
KEEPS
IT
CIRCUMSCRIBED
IN
A
COMPLEX
SOCIETY
WHEN
IT
IS
IN
THE
INTEREST
OF
NEITHER
CAPITALISTS
NOR
CONSUMERS
TO
REFRAIN
FROM
USING
GOVERNMENT
POWER
FOR
THEIR
OWN
ENDS
BUT
APART
FROM
THAT
LITTLE
CONUNDRUM
THIS
IS
A
DIFFICULT
PROBLEM
FOR
WHICH
THERE
IS
NO
OBVIOUSLY
GOOD
SOLUTION
ONE
APPROACH
IS
SIMPLY
TO
TRY
AND
MOVE
POLITICAL
OPINION
AND
HOPE
A
NEW
MORE
LIBERTARIAN
CONSENSUS
LASTS
FOR
A
WHILE
ANOTHER
APPROACH
IS
TO
TRY
AND
AMEND
THE
CONSTITUTION
THE
ORIGINAL
CONSTITUTION
RESTRAINED
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
FROM
ECONOMIC
INTERVENTION
FOR
TO
YEARS
DEPENDING
ON
JUST
HOW
ONE
WANTS
TO
COUNT
IT
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
THOUGH
WEAKENED
IN
MANY
WAYS
STILL
RESTRAINS
GOVERNMENT
PARTICULARLY
STATE
AND
LOCAL
EVEN
THOUGH
ON
MANY
PARTICULAR
ISSUES
THE
MAJORITY
IS
IN
FAVOR
OF
CENSORSHIP
I
THINK
LIBERTARIANS
WOULD
BE
HAPPY
WITH
ANOTHER
YEARS
OF
RESTRAINT
VIA
AN
AMENDMENT
OR
TWO
NOT
THAT
I
THINK
THATS
LIKELY
TO
HAPPEN
NOT
NECESSARILY
MR
HENDRICKS
BUT
OTHER
POSTERS
SEEM
TO
SEE
THIS
AS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
LIBERTARIANISM
THAT
IT
CANNOT
BE
STABLE
THAT
MIGHT
BE
TRUE
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
AN
OBJECTION
TO
LIBERTARIANISM
PER
SE
IF
A
LIBERTARIAN
POLITICAL
CONSENSUS
FORMS
FOR
A
DECADE
OR
TWO
AND
THEN
FALLS
APART
AGAIN
WE
WOULD
JUST
BE
BACK
WHERE
WE
ARE
NOW
THIS
IS
UNLIKE
THE
CASE
FOR
SOCIALISM
WHERE
A
SOCIALIST
CONSENSUS
THAT
HELD
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
THEN
FELL
APART
WOULD
NOT
LEAVE
US
WHERE
WE
ARE
NOW
BUT
INSTEAD
WITH
LOTS
OF
BUREAUCRACY
THAT
WOULD
BE
HARD
TO
GET
RID
OF
IF
NOT
TYRANNY
AS
THE
END
CONDITION
OF
A
STRONG
SOCIALIST
CONSENSUS
