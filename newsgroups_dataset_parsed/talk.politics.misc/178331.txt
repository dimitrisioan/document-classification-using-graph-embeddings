IM
SICK
OF
IT
THIS
CONTINUAL
EFFORT
TO
INFLAME
THE
PASSIONS
OF
AMERICANS
BY
PLAYING
EVERY
TRIAL
AS
COMPLETELY
SEXIST
RACIST
OR
GAYBASHING
WHEN
THE
REALITIES
ARE
SELDOM
THIS
SIMPLE
THIS
IS
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
A
SOCIETY
BECOMES
TIED
UP
IN
IDEOLOGIES
I
HAVE
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
TV
STATIONS
HERE
IN
LA
WANT
A
RIOT
TO
HAPPEN
WHEN
THE
VERDICT
COMES
IN
IN
A
NOT
SO
SUBTLE
WAY
THEY
ARE
PREPARING
THEIR
AUDIENCE
FOR
THE
WORST

EVEN
GOING
SO
FAR
AS
TO
WANT
SOMETHING
TO
HAPPEN
FOR
THEIR
VIEWERS
WITH
ALL
THEIR
COMMERCIALS
AND
THEIR
WE
ARE
READY
FOR
ANYTHING
SO
WATCH
US
MESSAGES

I
AS
MUCH
AS
ANY
OTHER
MAN
AM
IN
FAVOR
OF
HAVING
THE
SUPERIOR
POSITION
ASSIGNED
