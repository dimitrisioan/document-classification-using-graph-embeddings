i
want
to
know
that
i
have
a
competent
doctor
when
i
am
ill
government
regulations
have
driven
up
costs
and
decreased
quality
by
providing
a
monopoly
for
licensed
mds
many
procedures
could
be
performed
by
qualified
nurses
but
doctors
are
forced
to
do
them
the
common
cold
must
be
diagnosed
by
a
licensed
doctor
who
is
the
only
one
who
is
allowed
to
write
a
perscription
doctors
are
spending
much
of
their
time
on
such
mundane
cases
that
they
cannot
have
the
time
to
spend
on
the
really
tough
cases
this
results
in
higher
cost
lower
quality
medical
care
here
in
georgia
the
state
legislature
in
accidentally
passed
a
law
lobbied
for
by
opthamologists
prohibiting
anyone
but
a
licensed
md
from
giving
shots
they
were
trying
to
limit
optometrists
from
competing
with
them
they
inadvertantly
forbade
nurses
emts
dentists
and
tattoo
artists
from
piercing
the
skin
probably
diabetics
too
the
secretary
of
states
office
announced
on
june
that
they
wouldnt
enforce
it
pending
reconsideration
in
the
legislature
in
the
hassle
over
the
state
flag
i
heard
nothing
about
repealing
it
