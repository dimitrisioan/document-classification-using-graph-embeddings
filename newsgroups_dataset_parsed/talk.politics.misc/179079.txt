i
really
dont
want
to
waste
time
in
here
to
do
battle
about
the
legalization
of
drugs
if
you
really
want
to
we
can
get
into
it
and
prove
just
how
idiotic
that
idea
is
read
i
do
not
know
what
the
fuck
im
talking
about
and
am
not
eager
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
oh
you
foolish
person
i
do
know
what
the
fuck
im
talking
about
and
will
gladly
demonstrate
for
such
ignorants
as
yourself
if
you
wish
the
legalization
of
drugs
will
provide
few
if
any
of
the
benefits
so
highly
taunted
by
its
proponents
safer
cheaper
drugs
along
with
revenues
from
taxes
on
those
drugs
reduced
crime
and
reduced
organized
crime
specifically
etc
etc
ahhh
the
classic
truth
by
blatant
assertion
technique
too
bad
its
so
demonstrably
false
take
a
look
at
great
britain
sometime
for
a
nice
history
on
drug
criminalization
the
evidence
there
shows
that
during
periods
of
time
when
drugs
such
as
heroin
were
illegal
crime
went
up
and
people
did
die
from
bad
drugs
during
times
when
drugs
were
legalized
those
trends
were
reversed
if
you
would
like
to
prove
how
clueless
you
are
we
can
get
into
why
again
a
lot
of
wasted
posts
that
i
dont
think
this
group
was
intended
for
and
something
easily
solved
by
you
doing
a
little
research
now
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
ironclad
proof
gosh
im
convinced
for
the
humor
impaired
first
assert
something
for
which
you
have
no
evidence
then
dodge
requests
for
proof
by
claiming
to
know
what
this
group
was
intended
for
as
to
research
if
youd
done
any
at
all
youd
realize
that
there
is
plenty
of
reason
to
believe
that
legalizing
drugs
will
have
many
benefits
to
society
there
are
some
plausible
arguments
against
it
too
but
they
arent
enough
to
convince
me
that
criminalization
of
drugs
is
the
answer
im
willing
to
be
convinced
im
wrong
but
i
seriously
doubt
the
likes
of
you
can
do
it
dale
cook
any
town
having
more
churches
than
bars
has
a
serious
social
problem
