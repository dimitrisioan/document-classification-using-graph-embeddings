STARTS
OUT
WITHOUT

AFTER

WE

DO
AND
NO

TEACHES

TO

ITS
SOMETIMES
HARD
TO
SEE
HOW
THEY
CAN
AVOID
BECOMING
SO
BASED
ON
THEIR

OBSERVATIONS
AND
INSTINCT
FOR
SELFPRESERVATION
WE
ALWAYS
TAUGHT

CAN

WHAT
CAN
WE

SINCE

I

THE

THROUGH

IGNORING

TREATING

ALAN
YOU
CAN
START
BY
TEACHING
YOUR
CHILDREN
THAT
THE
PERPETRATORS
OF
CRIMES
NO
MORE
REPRESENT
THE
BLACK
COMMUNITY
THAN
RACIST
HATEFUL
WHITES
REPRESENT
THE
MAJORITY
CULTURE
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
MANY
ETHNIC
MINORITIES
WHO
HAVE
FALLEN
INTO
THE
VERY
TRAP
THAT
YOU
ARE
STRUGGLING
WITH
AND
BELIEVE
OTHERWISE
THE
TRAP
IS
THE
EASY
WAY
OUT
FOR
YOURSELF
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THE
DEMOGRAPHICS
RELATED
TO
THE
CRIMES
YOU
SPEAK
OF
HAVE
LESS
TO
DO
WITH
RACE
AND
MUCH
TO
DO
WITH
SOCIOECONOMIC
STATUS
AND
DISENFRANCHISEMENT
YOURE
GOING
TO
FIND
HIGHER
CRIME
WITHIN
ANY
COMMUNITY
COMPRISED
OF
ANY
ETHNIC
GROUP
OR
SUBGROUP
THAT
HAS
BECOME
DYSFUNCTIONAL
WHATEVER
THE
FACTORS
LEADING
TO
THAT
DYSFUNCTION
WITH
ETHNIC
MINORITIES
IT
IS
MORE
USUALLY
THAN
NOT
AS
I
SAID
SOCIOECONOMIC
DISENFRANCHISEMENT
IF
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
LIVED
IN
AN
AREA
WHERE
THERE
WERE
VERY
FEW
BLACKS
BUT
QUITE
A
FEW
POORFORGENERATIONS
WHITES
YOUD
SEE
THE
CRIME
STATISTICS
REFLECTING
THE
DYSFUNCTION
OF
THOSE
WHITE
PEOPLE
WOULD
YOU
THEN
WORRY
ABOUT
WHTHER
YOUR
CHILDREN
WOULD
BEGIN
TO
SEE
WHITES
AS
UNDESIREABLE
OR
WHATEVER
THE
TRAP
SPRINGS
INTO
ACTION
WHEN
OUR
INNATE
COMPUNCTION
TO
DEFINE
US
AND
OTHER
RAISES
ITS
LITTLE
VOICE
THE
TRAP
BECOMES
DANGEROUS
WHEN
WE
STOP
TO
LISTEN
TO
THAT
LITTLE
VOICE
AND
STOP
THINKING
LIKE
RATIONAL
HUMANS
ITS
INTERESTING
THAT
BLACKS
ARE
TRADITIONALLY
SEEN
AS
THE
OR
THE
MOST
CRIMINAL
ELEMENT
IN
MANY
OF
OUR
URBAN
AREAS
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
RACIAL
MAKEUP
OF
PHOENIX
SO
I
CANT
SPEAK
TO
YOUR
SITUATION
HOWEVER
I
LIVE
IN
SAN

A
CITY
THAT
LOVES
TO

ITS

WE
HAVE

GANGS
ASIAN
YES
THE

MINORITY
GANGS
AND
EVEN
A
FEW
WHITE
GANGS
THE
ASIAN
GANGS
HAVE
BECOME
A
PARTICULARLY
TROUBLESOME
ELEMENT
FOR
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
HERE
MAINLY
DUE
I
THINK
TO
THEIR
PROPENSITY
FOR
ENGAGING
IN
ORGANIZED
CRIMINAL
ACTIVITIES
BUT
ASK
PEOPLE
ON
THE
STREET
AND
THEYLL
TIMES
TELL
YOU
THAT
BLACK
GANGS
AND
CRIME
ARE
WHAT
THEY
MOST
FEAR
DURING
THE
DISTURBANCE
IN
LOS
ANGELES
LAST
YEAR
MANY
OF
THE
RIOTERS
AND
LOOTERS
WERE
NOT
BLACK
SOME
WERE
EVEN
WHITE
I
REMEMBER
BEING
AMAZED
AT
TELEVISION
NEWS
SCENES
THAT
SHOWED
LOOTING
MOBS
WHERE
THERE
WERE
MAYBE
ONE
OR
TWO
BLACKS
AT
MOST
MY
PERCEPTIONS
GLEANED
FROM

NEWS
WERE
FURTHER
CORROBORATED
BY
NUMEROUS
FRIENDS
AND
RELATIVES
THAT
LIVE
IN
LOS

THIS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
COUNTRYS
FIRST
TRULY
MULTIETHNIC
RIOT
YET
I
KNOW
FROM
FACETOFACE
AND
ONLINE
DISCUSSION
THAT
IN
THE
MINDS
OF
AMERICA
THE
POPULAR
PERCEPTION
IS
THAT
IT
WAS
A
BLACK
RIOT
IN
CLOSING
ID
LIKE
TO
SAY
THAT
YOU
RAISE
SOME
INTERESTING
POINTS
THAT
REALLY
NEED
DISCUSSION
OUR
COUNTRY
HAS
SPENT
TOO
LONG
IGNORING
THE
RACISM
AND
ITS
ATTENDANT
ILLS
THAT
IS
VERY
MUCH
A
PART
OF
OUR
CULTURE
AS
A
PEOPLE
WE
ARE
AFRAID
TO
FACE
UP
TO
SOME
HURTFUL
TRUTHS
AND
THE
PROBLEM
BECOMES
COMPOUNDED
DAILY
WE
CANNOT
AFFORD
TO
DO
IT
MUCH
LONGER
I
TRULY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
WELLBEING
OF
ALL
OF
US
DEPENDS
ON
CHANGING
OUR
CURRENT
COURSE
OF
DENIAL
AND
REPRESSION
I
WISH
