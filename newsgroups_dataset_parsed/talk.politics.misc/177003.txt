FRANCIS
A
NEY
SAYS
OF
WHO
ELSE
BUT
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
WILLIAM
JEFFERSON
CLINTON
ITS
A
MUCH
BETTER
DEAL
TO
HAVE
HIM
END
HIS
TERM
OF
OFFICE
IN
DISGRACE
AFTER
WATCHING
ALL
HIS
LIBERAL
DEMOCRAT
FRIENDS
ON
HIS
STAFF
RUN
THIS
NATION
DOWN
THE
TOILET
TSK
SURELY
YOU
DONT
WISH
FOR
THE
DEMOCRATS
TO
DESTROY
OUR
BELOVED
COUNTRY
JUST
SO
YOUR
PARTY
CAN
GET
SOME
TRIVIAL
POLITICAL
ADVANTAGE
THATS
RATHER
A
PETTY
WAY
TO
THINK
NOT
THAT
THIS
PETTINESS
DOESNT
EXTEND
ALL
THE
WAY
TO
THE
US
SENATE
IVE
NOTICED
WHILE
BUSH
WAS
PRESIDENT
I
KEPT
HOPING
AND
PRAYING
THAT
HED
WISE
UP
I
COULDNT
STAND
THE
MAN
BUT
I
WISH
HED
DONE
A
DECENT
JOB
IF
SO
WE
MIGHT
NOT
BE
IN
THE
MESS
WE
ARE
NOW
AND
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
SMALL
PRICE
TO
PAY
FOR
SUFFERING
THROUGH
ANOTHER
TERM
OF
REPUBLICAN
CONTROL
SIMILARILY
YOU
SHOULD
BE
HOPING
AND
PRAYING
THAT
CLINTON
DOES
A
GOOD
JOB
EVEN
IF
YOURE
CERTAIN
HE
WONT
SO
I
PROPOSE
THAT
WE
DESTROY
THE
MOON
NEATLY
SOLVING
THAT
PROBLEM
YOUR
BLOOD
PRESSURE
JUST
WENT
UP
MARK
SACHS
IS
DISCLAIMER
IF
PSU
KNEW
I
HAD
OPINIONS
THEYD
TRY
TO
CHARGE
ME
FOR
THEM
