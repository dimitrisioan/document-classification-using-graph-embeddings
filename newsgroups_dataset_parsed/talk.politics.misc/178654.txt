HALLAMDSCOMSADESYDE
PHILL
HALLAMBAKER
WRITES
IN
ORDER
TO
REJECT
THE
WORD
OF
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
IT
IS
NECCESSARY
TO
BELEIVE
THE
WORDS
OF
A
MAN
WHO
HAS
JUST
MURDERED
CHILDREN
AND
ORDERED
THE
SUICIDEMURDER
OF
HIS
OTHER
FOLLOWERS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
ACCOUNT
GIVEN
THE
BATF
ATTEMPTED
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
UPON
KORESH
AT
THE
RANCH
AND
WERE
MET
BY
GUNFIRE
IN
A
DELIBERATE
ATTEMPT
TO
MURDER
THEM
THE
KORESHGUN
SUPPORTER
CLAIM
THAT
THE
BATF
STARTED
SHOOTING
SIMPLY
DOES
NOT
STAND
UP
IF
THE
AFT
HAD
GONE
THERE
TO
START
SHOOTING
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
WITH
HEAVIER
GRADE
WEAPONRY
THAN
STANDARD
ISSUE
HANDGUNS
FOR
ALL
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
THEY
WERE
UNARMED
THE
BD
FOLLOWERS
HAD
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
WANT
GUN
CONTROL
MUST
OBVIOUSLY
DISCOUNT
THE
ENTIRE
GOVERNMENT
STORY
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
RATIONALISATION
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
TO
SIMPLY
DISMISS
THE
GOVERNMENT
AS
INCOMPETENT
THAT
WOULD
REQUIRE
THEM
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
SOLUTION
THEMSELVES
INSTEAD
THEY
HAVE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
GOVERNMENT
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
WHEREBY
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECIDED
TO
SET
OUT
TO
MURDER
PEOPLE
JUST
TO
SET
UP
SOME
SORT
OF
SCARE
TO
ALOW
THEM
TO
GET
GUN
CONTROL
LEGISLATION
THROUGH
I
MUST
OBJECT
TO
THE
CHARACTERIZATION
OF
THOSE
OPPOSED
TO
THE
GOVERNMENTS
HANDLING
OF
THE
WACO
SITUATION
AS
GUN
SUPPORTERS
YOUR
ARGUMENT
TRIES
TO
PAINT
THE
BATF
CRITICS
AS
RIGHTWING
GUN
NUTS
AND
JUST
MIXES
UP
TWO
ISSUES
I
AM
ONE
OF
THE
BATFFBI
CRITICS
AND
YET
I
AM
A
LIBERAL
AND
JUST
AS
ANTIGUN
AS
YOU
ARE
I
JUST
HAPPEN
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
EVERYONE
HAS
CIVIL
RIGHTS
EVEN
RELIGIOUS
CRAZIES
THEYRE
ALL
HUMAN
BEINGS
NOT
SOME
NEST
OF
WASPS
THAT
YOURE
TRYING
TO
EXTERMINATE
THE
BATF
CREATED
THE
CRISIS
SITUATION
BY
THE
WAY
THEY
HANDLED
THE
ORIGINAL
RAID
IT
WAS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
KORESH
REGULARLY
WENT
JOGGING
OUTSIDE
HIS
PROPERTY
HE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
SERVED
WITH
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
THEN
HE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
ARRESTED
IF
HE
HAD
REFUSED
TO
COMPLY
INSTEAD
OFFICERS
ARMED
WITH
GRENADES
INVADED
THE
PROPERTY
THIS
ESCALATED
INTO
A
SHOOTING
WAR
WITH
TRAGIC
DEATHS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
THOSE
WERE
THE
FIRST
TWO
MISTAKES
THE
BAD
JUDGMENT
OF
ASKING
FOR
A
NOKNOCK
WARRANT
AND
THE
BAD
AND
PROBABLY
ILLEGAL
WAY
THE
ALREADYUNWISE
WARRANT
WAS
SERVED
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
SITUATION
ESCALATED
TO
WHERE
IT
WAS
DESCRIBED
AS
AN
ARMED
STANDOFF
AND
A
HOSTAGE
CRISIS
THATS
WHEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
STARTED
COVERING
THEIR
TRACES
SEALING
THE
WARRANT
REVISING
THEIR
REPORTED
HISTORY
OF
THE
INCIDENT
ETC
THINGS
WERE
ALREADY
BUILDING
UP
TO
DISASTER
NOW
THE
GOVERNMENT
COULD
HAVE
SIMPLY
CLOSED
THE
SUPPLY
ROUTES
AND
WAITED
BUT
ACCORDING
TO
JANET
RENO
THAT
OPTION
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERED
SO
SUPPOSEDLY
BECAUSE
THE
AGENTS
WERE
FRUSTRATED
AND
FATIGUED
AND
BECAUSE
THERE
SUPPOSEDLY
WERE
NO
BACKUPS
THEY
FELT
THEY
HAD
TO
GO
IN
NOW
ITS
ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE
THAT
KORESH
WAS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
FIRE
IF
THATS
SO
HE
DESERVES
THE
BLAME
FOR
THE
DEATHS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
HIS
COMPOUND
BUT
THE
GOVERNMENTS
HANDS
ARE
FAR
FROM
CLEAN
THEIR
FIRST
RAID
DEMONSTRATED
BAD
JUDGMENT
PLUS
CONTEMPT
FOR
THE
AMENDMENT
THE
MOTIVATIONS
FOR
THE
SECOND
RAID
ARE
JUST
TOO
UNBELIEVABLE
AND
THEIR
COVERUP
OF
THE
EVENTS
OF
THE
FIRST
RAID
UNDERMINES
THEIR
CREDIBILITY
IN
ANYTHING
THEY
DO
THEREAFTER
WE
HAVE
ONLY
SOME
VERY
BIASED
FBI
AGENTS
WORD
FOR
WHAT
HAPPENED
AND
PLEASE
LETS
NOT
TURN
THIS
INTO
A
PROGUN
VS
ANTIGUN
DISCUSSION
ANTIGUN
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
GUNOWNERS
DESERVE
TO
GET
FRONTALLY
ASSAULTED
BY
ARMED
GOVERNMENT
AGENTS
AND
KORESHS
