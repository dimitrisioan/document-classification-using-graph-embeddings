LET
ME
TRY
TO
DRAG
THIS
DISCUSSION
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
ISSUES
AS
IVE
NOTED
BEFORE
IM
NOT
NECESSARILY
DISPUTING
THE
BENEFITS
OF
ELIMINATING
ANTICOMPETITIVE
LEGISLATION
WITH
REGARD
TO
AUTO
DEALERS
BARBERS
ETC
ONE
NEED
NOT
HOWEVER
SWALLOW
THE
ENTIRE
LIBERTARIAN
AGENDA
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THIS
END
JUST
BECAUSE
ONE
GRANTS
THE
BENEFITS
OF
ALLOWING
ANYONE
WHO
WISHES
TO
CUT
HAIR
TO
SELL
HISHER
SERVICES
WITHOUT
REGULATION
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THE
SAME
UNREGULATED
BARBERS
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
BLEED
PEOPLE
AS
A
MEDICAL
SERVICE
WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
AS
SOMEMANY
LIBERTARIANS
WOULD
ARGUE
ON
A
CASE
BY
CASE
BASIS
THE
COSTBENEFIT
RATIO
OF
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
IS
OBVIOUSLY
WORTHWHILE
THE
LIBERTARIAN
AGENDA
HOWEVER
DOES
NOT
CALL
FOR
THIS
ASSESSMENT
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
COSTS
OF
REGULATION
OF
ANY
KIND
ALWAYS
OUTWEIGH
ITS
BENEFITS
THIS
APPROACH
AVOIDS
ALL
SORTS
OF
DIFFICULT
ANALYSIS
BUT
IT
STRIKES
MANY
OF
THE
REST
OF
US
AS
DOGMATIC
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
I
HAVE
NO
OBJECTION
TO
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
MEDICAL
CARE
EDUCATION
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
OR
LOCAL
POLICE
THAT
SUGGESTS
A
FREE
MARKET
CAN
PROVIDE
A
MORE
EFFECTIVE
EFFICIENT
MEANS
OF
ACCOMPLISHING
SOCIAL
OBJECTIVES
THAN
IS
PROVIDED
THROUGH
STATIST
APPROACHES
WITH
SOME
NOTABLE
EXCEPTIONS
HOWEVER
I
DO
NOT
SEE
SUCH
NITTYGRITTY
WORTHWHILE
ANALYSIS
BEING
CARRIED
OUT
BY
SELFPROFESSED
LIBERTARIANS
EXCELLENTLY
PUT
EVEN
AS
A
LIBERTARIAN
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
GOVERNMENT
DOES
DO
SOME
THINGS
I
LIKE
THERE
IS
A
BEAUTIFUL
PERFORMING
ARTS
COMPLEX
IN
FT
LAUDERDALE
THAT
WAS
PARTIALLY
BUILT
WITH
TAX
DOLLARS
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
WAS
PRIVATE
AND
HOW
MUCH
WAS
STOLEN
I
MEAN
PUBLIC
BUT
IT
IS
BEAUTIFUL
AND
I
ENJOY
IT
KEEP
IN
MIND
THOUGH
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
CITY
WILL
NEVER
ATTEND
A
SINGLE
PERFORMANCE
THERE
SO
THEY
MIGHT
FEEL
DIFFERENTLY
ABOUT
HAVING
TO
HELP
PAY
FOR
IT
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
TO
DISAGREE
ABOUT
IT
BEING
DESIREABLE
OR
EFFICIENT
TO
GIVE
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTIONPOWER
ON
A
CASEBYCASE
BASIS
IN
FACT
WE
HAVE
A
LOT
BETTER
LUCK
MAINTAINING
OUR
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
IT
IS
NOT
DECIDED
ON
A
CASEBYCASE
BASIS
AS
MUCH
AS
OTHER
ISSUES
JUDGES
DECIDE
WHETHER
POLITICAL
SPEECH
IS
ALLOWED
ON
THE
SIDEWALK
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
POST
OFFICE
THEY
DO
NOT
TRY
TO
DECIDE
JUST
WHETHER
PRONAZI
PROCHOICE
PROLIFE
OR
PROTAX
POLITICAL
SPEECH
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
ON
THE
SIDEWALK
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
POST
OFFICE
YOU
CAN
IMAGINE
THE
RESULT
IF
RIGHT
TO
FREE
SPEECH
WAS
DECIDED
BY
THE
MAJORITY
ON
A
CASEBYCASE
BASIS
NOT
SO
WITH
ECONOMIC
ISSUES
GOVERNMENT
DOES
TELL
TAXIDRIVERS
EXACTLY
WHAT
THEY
CAN
CHARGE
BUT
NOT
THE
BUS
LINES
OR
THE
LAWYERS
JUST
AS
IT
IS
NOT
DESIREABLE
TO
DECIDE
RIGHTS
OF
FREE
SPEECH
ON
A
CASEBYCASE
BASIS
WE
SHOULD
NOT
DECIDE
RIGHTS
TO
FREE
ENTERPRISE
ON
A
CASEBYCASE
BASIS
THERE
IS
HOPE
THAT
A
GOVERNMENT
CAN
BE
RESTRICTED
FROM
INTERFERRING
WITH
FREE
ENTERPRISE
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
HOPE
IN
MY
OPINION
OF
HAVING
A
GOVERNMENT
THAT
INTERFERES
WITH
FREE
ENTERPRISE
IN
AN
EFFICIENT
MANNER
I
CALL
IT
POLITICAL
MARKET
FAILURE
THUS
IF
YOU
VALUE
FREEDOM
AND
THE
ABUNDANCE
IT
PRODUCES
YOU
HAVE
TO
SWALLOW
THE
WHOLE
LIBERTARIAN
AGENDA
