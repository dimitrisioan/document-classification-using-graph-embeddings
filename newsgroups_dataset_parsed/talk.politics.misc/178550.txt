FOR

REMARKS
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
TO
LAW

ORGANIZATIONS
THE
ROSE
GARDEN
PM
EDT
THE
PRESIDENT
GOOD
AFTERNOON
LADIES
AND
GENTLEMEN
TWO
MONTHS
AGO
I
PRESENTED
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PLAN
TO
REDUCE
OUR
NATIONAL
DEFICIT
AND
TO
INCREASE
OUR
INVESTMENT
IN
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
THEIR
JOBS
AND
THEIR
ECONOMIC
FUTURE
THE
FEDERAL
BUDGET
PLAN
PASSED
CONGRESS
IN
RECORD
TIME
AND
CREATED
A
NEW
SENSE
OF
HOPE
AND
OPPORTUNITY
IN
THE
COUNTRY
THEN
THE
SHORTTERM
JOBS
PLAN
I
PRESENTED
TO
CONGRESS
WHICH
WOULD
CREATE
A
HALF
A
MILLION
JOBS
IN
THE
NEXT
TWO
YEARS
PASSED
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
IT
NOW
HAS
THE
SUPPORT
OF
A
MAJORITY
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
SENATE
ALL
OF
THESE
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS
KNOW
ITS
TIME
TO
GET
THE
ECONOMY
MOVING
AGAIN
TO
GET
JOB
GROWTH
GOING
AGAIN
TO
GET
A
FAST
START
ON
THE
INVESTMENTS
WE
NEED
TO
BUILD
A
LASTING
PROSPERITY
UNFORTUNATELY
A
MINORITY
OF
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
SENATE
HAVE
USED
GRIDLOCK
TACTICS
TO
PREVENT
THEIR
COLLEAGUES
FROM
WORKING
THE
WILL
OF
THE
MAJORITY
ON
THE
JOBS
BILL
WHEN
CONGRESS
RETURNS
I
ASK
EVERY
SENATOR
FROM
EVERY
STATE
AND
FROM
BOTH
PARTIES
TO
REMEMBER
WHAT
IS
AT
STAKE
THE
ISSUE
IS
NOT
POLITICS
ITS
PEOPLE
SIXTEEN
MILLION
OF
THEM
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
FULLTIME
JOBS
AND
CANT
FIND
THEM
THESE
MEN
AND
WOMEN
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
WHOS
UP
OR
DOWN
IN
WASHINGTON
THEY
CARE
ABOUT
PAYING
THE
RENT
AND
MEETING
THE
MORTGAGE
PAYMENT
ABOUT
PUTTING
FOOD
ON
THE
TABLE
AND
BUYING
SHOES
FOR
THEIR
CHILDREN
ABOUT
REGAINING
A
SENSE
OF
DIGNITY
THAT
COMES
FROM
DOING
A
DAYS
WORK
AND
SUPPORTING
THEIR
FAMILIES
AND
DRAWING
A
PAYCHECK
THEYRE
ASKING
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
HAVE
THE
PRIVILEGE
OF
SERVING
TO
PUT
ASIDE
POLITICS
AND
DO
SOMETHING
NOW
TO
MOVE
OUR
ECONOMY
FORWARD
I
AM
PREPARED
TO
DO
THAT
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
WORKING
WITH
THE
SENATE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
AN
ADJUSTED
PACKAGE
THAT
MEETS
SOME
OF
THE
CONCERNS
OF
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
BLOCKING
ACTION
ON
THE
JOBS
PLAN
IM
WILLING
TO
COMPROMISE
SO
LONG
AS
WE
KEEP
THE
FOCUS
ON
JOBS
KEEP
THE
FOCUS
ON
GROWTH
AND
KEEP
THE
FOCUS
ON
MEETING
UNMET
NATIONAL
NEEDS
OUR
OPPONENTS
HAVE
BEEN
ASKING
FOR
A
SMALLER
PACKAGE
TODAY
I
ASK
THEM
TO
JOIN
ME
IN
DETERMINING
EXACTLY
WHAT
KIND
AND
WHAT
SIZE
PACKAGE
CONGRESS
CAN
APPROVE
THAT
ACTUALLY
MEETS
THE
NEEDS
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
BUT
EVEN
AS
WE
MAKE
THOSE
REDUCTIONS
AND
THE
PACKAGE
WILL
BE
SMALLER
I
BELIEVE
WE
MUST
ADDRESS
PROBLEMS
THAT
ARE
ON
THE
MINDS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
AMERICANS
AND
ONE
IN
PARTICULAR
AND
THAT
IS
THE
NEED
TO
TOUGHEN
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
IN
OUR
SOCIETY
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
DRAMATIC
RISE
IN
VIOLENT
CRIME
SO
I
WILL
ASK
EVEN
IN
THIS
REDUCED
PACKAGE
FOR
AN
ADDITIONAL
MILLION
IN
FEDERAL
FUNDING
TO
HELP
LOCAL
COMMUNITIES
TO
REHIRE
POLICE
OFFICERS
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
LAID
OFF
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FISCAL
PROBLEMS
CAUSED
BY
THE
NATIONAL
RECESSION
TOGETHER
WITH
A
MATCHING
EFFORT
BY
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
THIS
COULD
PUT
AS
MANY
AS
POLICE
OFFICERS
BACK
ON
THE
JOB
AND
BACK
ON
THE
BEAT
IN
COMMUNITIES
ALL
ACROSS
OUR
NATION
AT
A
TIME
WHEN
TOO
MANY
OF
OUR
PEOPLE
LIVE
IN
FEAR
OF
VIOLENT
CRIME
WHEN
TOO
MANY
BUSINESSES
HAVE
CLOSED
AND
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
LOST
THEIR
JOBS
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
ARE
AFRAID
TO
LEAVE
THEIR
HOMES
REHIRING
THOUSANDS
OF
OFFICERS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
INVESTMENTS
AMERICA
CAN
MAKE
AND
I
ASK
BOTH
HOUSES
OF
CONGRESS
TO
MAKE
THAT
INVESTMENT
IN
OUR
PEOPLES
SAFETY
AND
IN
THEIR
PIECE
OF
MIND
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
NEED
FOR
STRONG
FEDERAL
ACTION
TO
KEEP
THE
ECONOMY
GOING
TOWARD
RECOVERY
AND
TO
CREATE
JOBS
MAKE
NO
MISTAKE
ABOUT
IT
I
WILL
FIGHT
FOR
THESE
PRIORITIES
AS
HARD
AS
I
EVER
HAVE
I
WILL
NEVER
FORGET
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
SENT
ME
HERE
TO
FIGHT
FOR
THEIR
JOBS
THEIR
FUTURE
AND
FOR
FUNDAMENTAL
CHANGE
I
WANT
TO
THANK
THE
POLICE
OFFICERS
WHO
ARE
HERE
TODAY
AND
TELL
YOU
THAT
NOT
A
SINGLE
ONE
OF
THEM
KNEW
BEFORE
THEY
CAME
HERE
THAT
I
HAD
DETERMINED
TO
ASK
FOR
MORE
MONEY
IN
THIS
JOBS
BILL
TO
REHIRE
POLICE
OFFICERS
THEY
CAME
HERE
BECAUSE
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
PORTION
OF
THE
PACKAGE
AND
I
WANT
THEM
TO
BE
FREE
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THAT
THEY
CAME
HERE
NOT
OUT
OF
ANY
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
CONCERN
OTHER
THAN
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
WANTED
THE
KIDS
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
TO
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
HAVE
JOBS
THIS
SUMMER
TO
HAVE
SAFER
STREETS
AND
A
BRIGHTER
AND
MORE
PEACEFUL
FUTURE
I
SAY
WHAT
I
SAY
TODAY
NOT
JUST
BECAUSE
ITS
GOOD
FOR
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
BUT
BECAUSE
ITS
GOOD
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
LIVE
IN
THESE
COMMUNITIES
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
SUPPORTED
COMMUNITY
POLICING
NOT
ONLY
BECAUSE
IT
HELPS
TO
PREVENT
CRIME
AND
TO
LOWER
THE
CRIME
RATE
BUT
BECAUSE
IT
CEMENTS
BETTER
RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN
PEOPLE
IN
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AND
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
THEYRE
HIRED
TO
PROTECT
IT
REDUCES
THE
CHANCES
OF
ABUSIVE
ACTION
BY
POLICE
OFFICERS
AND
INCREASES
THE
CHANCES
OF
HARMONY
AND
SAFE
STREETS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THESE
ARE
THE
KINDS
OF
THINGS
THAT
WE
ARE
TRYING
TO
DO
I
PROMISED
IN
MY
CAMPAIGN
THAT
ID
DO
EVERYTHING
I
COULD
TO
PUT
ANOTHER
POLICE
OFFICERS
ON
THE
STREET
OVER
THE
NEXT
FOUR
YEARS
THIS
MAKES
A
GOOD
DOWNPAYMENT
ON
THAT
THIS
KEEPS
IN
MIND
THE
CORE
OF
THE
JOBS
PACKAGE
AND
THIS
WILL
HELP
US
TO
MOVE
FORWARD
SO
I
ASK
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
SENATE
WHO
HAVE
BLOCKED
THE
JOBS
BILL
LETS
WORK
TOGETHER
I
CAN
ACCEPT
A
REDUCED
PACKAGE
IF
YOU
WILL
INCREASE
YOUR
COMMITMENT
TO
SAFE
STREETS
I
DO
NOT
ACCEPT
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
SHOULD
REDUCE
OUR
COMMITMENT
TO
SUMMER
JOBS
OR
TO
BUILDING
OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE
OR
TO
DOING
THOSE
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
WILL
CREATE
REAL
AND
LASTING
PROSPERITY
FOR
OUR
PEOPLE
I
HAVE
DONE
MY
PART
NOW
TO
END
THE
GRIDLOCK
I
ASK
YOU
TO
DO
YOURS
I
WANT
NOW
TO
GIVE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
HERE
WITH
ME
ON
THE
PLATFORM
A
CHANCE
TO
MAKE
SOME
REMARKS
AND
TO
BE
HEARD
BY
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
BEGINNING
WITH
JANET
RENO
THE
DISTINGUISHED
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
CAN
YOU
TELL
US
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
THE
JOBS
PACKAGE
COULD
BE
PUT
IN
FURTHER
JEOPARDY
BY
CONTROVERSY
OVER
THE
SUGGESTION
OF
A
VAT
TAX
AT
THIS
POINT
IN
THE
CONGRESSIONAL
DIALOGUE
THE
PRESIDENT
NOT
AT
ALL
I
THINK
IT
SHOULD
HAVE
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
ANY
RELATIONSHIP
ONE
TO
THE
OTHER
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
MADE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
DECISION
ON
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
THERES
A
LOT
OF
SUPPORT
IN
THE
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
AND
THE
LABOR
COMMUNITY
PEOPLE
HAVE
ASKED
US
TO
CONSIDER
THAT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ENORMOUS
BURDEN
OF
THE
PRESENT
SYSTEM
ON
MANY
OF
OUR
MAJOR
EMPLOYERS
PARTICULARLY
MANY
OF
THOSE
THAT
WE
DEPEND
UPON
TO
GENERATE
JOBS
AND
TO
CARRY
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THIS
ECONOMY
BUT
I
HAVE
MADE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
DECISION
THAT
WOULD
EVEN
APPROACH
THAT
ON
THAT
OR
ANY
OTHER
KIND
OF
GENERAL
TAX
Q
DO
YOU
PERSONALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
AMERICAN
PUBLIC
IS
READY
TO
PAY
FOR
TO
HAVE
ANOTHER
TAX
TO
PAY
FOR
HEALTH
CARE
I
MEAN
APART
FROM
WHAT
BUSINESS
AND
LABOR
LEADERS
HAVE
SAID
THE
PRESIDENT
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
SPECULATE
ON
THAT
I
WILL
SAY
THIS
THE
REAL
ISSUE
IS
HOW
QUICKLY
WE
CAN
RECYCLE
THE
BENEFITS
OF
ALL
THE
SAVINGS
TO
COVER
THE
COST
I
MEAN
THAT
IS
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
IF
YOU
DO
WHAT
WERE
PROPOSING
TO
DO
IF
YOU
STREAMLINE
THE
INSURANCE
SYSTEM
IF
YOU
FIX
THE
SYSTEM
SO
THAT
THERES
NO
LONGER
AN
ENORMOUS
ECONOMIC
INCENTIVE
TO
OVERUTILIZE
OR
OVERPROVIDE
CERTAIN
SERVICES
IF
YOU
PROVIDE
PRIMARY
AND
PREVENTIVE
CARE
IN
PLACES
WHERE
IT
ISNT
NOW
EVERY
SINGLE
ANALYSIS
SHOWS
ABSOLUTELY
MASSIVE
SAVINGS
TO
THE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
THE
REAL
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
YOU
CAN
TRANSFER
THOSE
SAVINGS
TO
COVER
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
NO
COVERAGE
NOW
OR
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
VIRTUALLY
NO
COVERAGE
SO
THAT
YOU
PROVIDE
PEOPLE
THE
SECURITY
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
THE
POLLS
SAY
THAT
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
ALL
I
KNOW
IS
THE
POLLS
THAT
I
SEE
IN
THE
PRESS
THAT
MANY
OF
YOU
HAVE
COMMISSIONED
THEY
SAY
OVERWHELMINGLY
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
WANT
THE
SECURITY
OF
AN
AFFORDABLE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
HAS
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THIS
STIMULUS
AND
IT
CERTAINLY
SHOULDNT
HAVE
PEOPLE
WANT
A
JOB
FIRST
AND
FOREMOST
THEY
WANT
THAT
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
Q
NOW
THAT
YOUVE
ANNOUNCED
YOUR
WILLINGNESS
TO
COMPROMISE
ON
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
CAN
YOU
TELL
US
WHAT
PARTS
OF
YOUR
PACKAGE
YOU
CONSIDER
VITAL
AND
UNCOMPROMISABLE
I
ASSUME
SUMMER
JOBS
IS
ONE
THE
PRESIDENT
I
WANT
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
I
WANT
THE
HIGHWAY
PROGRAM
AND
I
WANT
THE
POLICE
PROGRAM
I
STILL
INTEND
LET
ME
SAY
THIS
I
STILL
INTEND
TO
FULLY
AND
AGGRESSIVELY
PUSH
THE
CRIME
BILL
WHICH
DID
NOT
PASS
THE
CONGRESS
LAST
YEAR
THIS
IS
A
SUPPLEMENT
TO
THAT
NOT
A
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
IT
IN
ANY
WAY
BUT
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
DO
THAT
I
THINK
WE
NEED
THE
RYAN
WHITE
FUNDS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ENORMOUS
HEALTH
CARE
BURDENS
TO
THE
COMMUNITIES
THAT
ARE
INORDINATELY
AND
DISPROPORTIONATELY
AFFECTED
BY
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
CARING
FOR
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
AND
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
I
THINK
SHOULD
BE
DONE
WE
HAVE
TO
DO
THE
AGRICULTURE
DEPARTMENT
MEAT
INSPECTORS
THE
SAFETY
OF
THE
PUBLIC
DEPENDS
ON
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
I
DONT
I
DONT
THINK
ANY
OF
IT
SHOULD
BE
CUT
BUT
I
HAVE
GIVEN
SENATOR
MITCHELL
AND
SENATOR
BYRD
I
TALKED
TO
THEM
AND
SENATOR
DOLE
CALLED
ME
YESTERDAY
TO
DISCUSS
THIS
AND
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
I
WOULD
CALL
HIM
BACK
I
CALLED
HIM
BACK
LAST
NIGHT
IN
NEW
HAMPSHIRE
AND
WE
DISCUSSED
THIS
AND
I
BASICALLY
ASKED
THEM
TO
TALK
TODAY
AND
SAID
THAT
I
WOULD
NOT
MAKE
ANY
STATEMENTS
ABOUT
ANY
SPECIFICS
UNTIL
AT
LEAST
THEY
HAD
A
CHANCE
TO
TALK
TO
SEE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
COULD
REACH
SOME
ACCORD
SO
I
DONT
WANT
TO
BE
ANY
MORE
SPECIFIC
THAN
I
HAVE
BEEN
ALREADY
AND
LETS
SEE
IF
THEY
CAN
TALK
IT
OUT
Q
WHEN
YOU
TALKED
TO
SENATOR
DOLE
AND
SENATOR
MITCHELL
DID
YOU
TELL
THEM
ABOUT
YOUR
INCREASE
ALSO
THAT
MILLION
THAT
YOU
WANT
THAT
AS
PART
OF
THE
PACKAGE
THE
PRESIDENT
I
DID
I
TOLD
SENATOR
I
LEFT
WORD
FOR
SENATOR
MITCHELL
LAST
NIGHT
ABOUT
IT
WHEN
I
TALKED
TO
SENATOR
DOLE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
FOR
SURE
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
I
MENTIONED
IT
BUT
I
DID
TELL
HIM
THAT
I
WAS
PREPARED
TO
REDUCE
THE
PACKAGE
AND
I
WANTED
TO
BREAK
THE
GRIDLOCK
AND
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
I
WAS
WORKING
ON
A
REFORMULATION
OF
IT
SO
THAT
IN
THE
HOPE
THAT
IT
WOULD
BECOME
EVEN
MORE
FOCUSED
ON
JOBS
AND
THE
KINDS
OF
ISSUES
THAT
I
THOUGHT
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
WANTED
US
TO
ADDRESS
AND
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
CONSISTENT
WITH
THAT
THANK
YOU
