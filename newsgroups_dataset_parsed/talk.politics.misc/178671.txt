JAMES
P
REYNOLDS
WRITES
PEOPE
JUST
DOESNT
GET
IT
THE
CURRENT
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
IS
A
CANCER
WHICH
IS
KILLING
OUR
ECONOMIC
WELLBEING
COSTS
ARE
STILL
RISING
PERCENT
A
YEAR
EVEN
AS
AMERICANS
BY
THE
TENS
OF
MILLIONS
GO
WITHOUT
OR
ARE
FORCED
INTO
MANAGEDCARE
PROGRAMS
WHICH
ARE
CERTAINLY
PRETTY
SOCIALIZED
ALREADY
IF
YOU
ASK
ME
A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
AGO
I
POSTED
A
MESSAGE
ASKING
ANY
HILLARYBASHERS
TO
PLEASE
COME
FORWARD
AND
PRESENT
NO
GIMMICKS
STRAIGHT
TALK
JUST
HOW
THEY
WOULD
SET
ABOUT
KEEPING
COSTS
DOWN
I
DIDNT
GET
A
SINGLE
ANSWER
THE
FIRST
THING
I
WOULD
DO
WOULD
BE
TO
DISBAND
MEDICARE
AND
MEDICADE
THEY
ARE
A
PRIMARY
REASON
WHY
HEALTH
CARE
COSTS
ARE
GOING
UP
TO
COVER
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
CURRENTLY
ON
THESE
PROGRAMS
I
WOULD
SELL
THEIR
COVERAGE
IN
BLOCKS
TO
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
THE
PRIVATE
COMPANIES
WOULD
BID
TO
GET
THESE
LARGE
BLOCKS
OF
PEOPLE
AND
PRICES
WOULD
GO
DOWN
TO
GET
AWAY
FROM
STRONG
FEDERAL
CONTROL
ON
HEALTH
CARE
I
WOULD
PASS
OFF
MORE
CONTROL
TO
THE
STATES
EVERYONE
IS
ALWAYS
SPEWING
FORTH
ABOUT
HOW
WONDERFUL
HAWAII
IS
DOING
WELL
HOW
ABOUT
GIVING
SOME
OTHER
STATES
INCENTIVE
TO
TRY
THEIR
OWN
PLANS
WHAT
I
WOULD
NOT
DO
IS
TRY
TO
IMPLEMENT
SOME
FAR
REACHING
FEDERAL
PROGRAM
PROGRAM
TO
COVER
ALL
AMERICANS
BECAUSE
THIS
IS
THE
SUREST
WAY
TO
FAIL
HOW
CAN
ANYONE
READ
THE
NEWS
LIVE
UNDER
OUR
SYSTEM
AND
NOT
SEE
THESE
FAULTS
HOW
CAN
WE
DEAL
WITH
THE
DEFICIT
OUR
CITIES
OUR
EDUCATIONAL
SYSTEM
OUR
INFRASTRUCURE
AIDS
MODERNIZING
OUR
INDUSTRY
ETC
IF
WE
DONT
QUIT
THROWING
AWAY
MONEY
WHICH
COULD
BE
USED
TO
SOLVE
THOSE
PROBLEMS
ONE
SURE
WAY
TO
STOP
THROWING
MONEY
AWAY
IS
TO
STOP
GIVING
SO
MUCH
TO
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
OUR
FEDERAL
TAXES
SHOULD
BE
SLASHED
AND
OUR
STATE
TAXES
INCREASED
A
STRONG
CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT
ALWAYS
FAILS
GIVE
POWER
BACK
TO
THE
STATESCOUNTIESCITIES
WHERE
IT
BELONGS
AMERICA
NEEDS
HEALTH
CARE
REFORM
NOW
DONT
JUST
SIT
THERE
AND
HILLARYBASH
INFORM
YOURSELF
THE
MORE
I
INFORM
MYSELF
THE
MORE
I
WANT
TO
HILLARYBASH
