remarks
by
the
president
in
question
and
answer
session
with
the
press
pm
edt
the
president
on
february
the
four
federal
agents
were
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
trying
to
enforce
the
law
against
the
branch
davidian
compound
which
had
illegally
stockpiled
weaponry
and
ammunition
and
placed
innocent
children
at
risk
because
the
batf
operation
had
failed
to
meet
its
objective
a
standoff
ensued
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
then
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
bring
this
perilous
situation
to
an
end
without
bloodshed
and
further
loss
of
life
the
bureaus
efforts
were
ultimately
unavailing
because
the
individual
with
whom
they
were
dealing
david
koresh
was
dangerous
irrational
and
probably
insane
the
stacy
koonlawrence
powell
defense
the
decisions
of
janet
reno
and
bill
clinton
in
this
affair
are
essentially
the
moral
equivalents
of
stacy
koons
reno
and
clinton
have
the
advantage
in
that
they
investigate
themselves
