AARON

BOYKEN
WRITES
IF
THE
VAT
WILL
BE
DONE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
THAT
STATE
AND
LOCAL
SALES
TAXES
ARE
DONE
NOTHING
WILL
BE
ON
THE
STICKER
THE
CLEARK
RINGING
UP
YOUR
PURCHASE
GUM
GAS
CAR
ETC
WILL
HIT
A
BUTTON
TO
ADD
ANOTHER
ON
TOP
OF
THE
STATE
AND
LOCAL
SALES
TAXES
AND
THAT
WONT
INCLUDE
ANY
OF
THE
VAT
FROM
PREVIOUS
LEVELS
OF
SALES
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
INCLUDE
THE
VAT
FROM
PREVIOUS
LEVELS
BECAUSE
THE
VAT
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
TAXIF
THE
VAT
IS
X
THAN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
TAX
THE
GOVERNMENT
RECEIVES
THROUGH
ALL
THE
LEVELS
IS
X
OF
THE
PURCHASE
PRICE
OF
THE
END
CONSUMER
AT
THE
INTERVENING
LEVELS
ONLY
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
VAT
PAID
OUT
AND
THE
VAT
RECEIVED
IS
REMITTED
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
HERES
A
QUESTION
WHAT
IF
INSTEAD
OF
A
TRUE
VAT
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IMPOSED
A
SALES
TAX
OF
SAY
THE
TAX
WOULD
ONLY
BE
PAID
ON
RETAIL
SALES
THUS
NOT
BUILDING
UP
AT
ALL
LEVELS
OF
PRODUCTION
COSTS
THAT
ARE
JUST
PASSED
ON
TO
CONSUMERS
ANYWAY
AND
WOULD
ONLY
GO
TO
REDUCING
THE
DEFICIT
I
KNOW
THAT
THIS
WOULD
NEVER
HAPPEN
BUT
IT
SEEMS
A
LOT
MORE
PALETTABLE
THAN
A
VAT
A
VAT
IS
INFINITELY
PREFERABLE
TO
A
RETAIL
SAILS
TAX
