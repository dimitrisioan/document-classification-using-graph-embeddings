ANY
GOVERNMENT
THAT
ALLOWS
TINPOT
DICTATORS
TO
SET
UP
SHOP
AND
DECLARE
A
PRIVATE
STATE
HAS
DRIFTED
INTO
ANARCHY
THERE
ARE
LAWS
TO
CONTROL
THE
OWNERSHIP
OF
GUNS
AND
THE
BATF
HAD
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELEIVE
THAT
THEY
WERE
BEING
VIOLATED
THEY
SET
OUT
TO
OBTAIN
A
LEGAL
WARRANT
AND
ATTEMPTED
TO
SERVE
IT
ONLY
TO
BE
MET
WITH
GUNFIRE
WHEN
THEY
RANG
THE
DOORBELL
THE
BATF
IN
A
LETTER
THEYVE
BEEN
SENDING
OUT
TO
PEOPLE
SAYS
BOTH
THAT
THEY
WERE
AMBUSHED
BECAUSE
THEY
LOST
THE
ELEMENT
OF
SURPRISE
AND
THAT
THEY
WENT
UP
AND
KNOCKED
ON
THE
DOOR
AND
HAD
IT
SLAMMED
IN
THEIR
FACES
IT
STRIKES
ME
AS
KIND
OF
STRANGE
TO
RELY
ON
SURPRISE
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
BY
KNOCKING
ON
THE
DOOR
PRESUMABLY
THE
BD
DID
NOT
MOUNT
A
CONTINUOUS
STATE
OF
ALERT
WITH
GUNMEN
READY
TO
FIRE
ON
PEOPLE
WHO
CASUALLY
WALKED
UP
TO
RING
THE
DOORBELL
LETS
TRY
THAT
AGAIN
WHY
WAS
THE
BATF
CONCERNED
ABOUT
SURPRISE
WHEN
THEY
INTENDED
TO
SERVE
THE
WARRANT
BY
KNOCKING
ON
THE
DOOR
THE
BATF
APPEARS
TO
BE
INCONSISTANT
IN
THEIR
OWN
DESCRIPTION
OF
EVENTS
AND
IN
ANY
CASE
HOW
DOES
ONE
MOUNT
AN
AMBUSH
IF
ONE
ISNT
ON
ALERT
HAD
THEY
EXPECTED
THE
BD
TO
BE
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
PEACEFULL
CITIZENS
WHO
WOULD
ACCEPT
A
SEARCH
AUTHORIZED
BY
A
COURT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TURNED
UP
IN
A
TANK
AND
BROKEN
THE
DOOR
DOWN
ON
DAY
ONE
PHILL
THE
BATF
WERE
IN
A
FIREFIGHT
WITH
THE
BD
FOR
FORTYFIVE
MINUTES
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTING
PEACEFUL
CITIZENS
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
SHOWN
UP
IN
LIVESTOCK
TRAILERS
AND
WOULD
HAVE
RETREATED
IMMEDIATELY
NOT
A
SMART
MOVE
UNLESS
MEANT
TO
BE
PART
OF
THE
SURPRIZE
COVER
EVEN
SO
THE
NARROW
OPENING
OF
THE
TRUCKS
SIMPLY
WAS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
A
SIDE
OPENING
TRUCK
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
BETTER
MORE
LIKE
A
COVERED
WAGGON
SO
WERE
THE
BATF
FIRED
ON
BEFORE
OR
AFTER
THEY
LEFT
THE
TRAILERS
TO
KNOCK
ON
THE
DOOR
TO
SERVE
THE
WARRANT
EVERY
DESCRIPTION
IVE
HEARD
INDICATES
THE
BATF
DID
NOT
HANG
AROUND
IN
THE
TRAILERS
ONCE
THEY
DECIDED
TO
OPEN
THEM
UP
FOR
THAT
MATTER
IF
THEY
EXPECT
PEACEFUL
CITIZENS
WHY
COME
IN
LIVE
STOCK
TRAILERS
TO
BEING
WITH
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTING
PEACFUL
CITIZENS
WHY
SHOW
UP
WITH
OVER
A
HUNDRED
OFFICERS
SOME
OF
WHICH
CLEARLY
VISIBLE
ON
VIDEO
TO
BE
CARRYING
SUBMACHINEGUNS
AND
NATIONAL
GUARD
HELICOPTERS
SOUNDS
JUST
ABOUT
RIGHT
TO
ME
ITS
THE
MINIMUM
AMOUNT
OF
FORCE
THAT
I
WOULD
CONSIDER
NECESSARY
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
ON
THE
TALKPOLITICSGUNS
ANNUAL
DINNER
OK
JUST
TO
MAKE
SURE
WEVE
GOT
THIS
STRAIGHT
YOU
CONSIDER
ARMED
TROOPS
IN
DISGUISED
VEHICLES
AND
MULTIPLE
HELICOPTERS
TO
BE
USED
TO
SERVE
SEARCH
WARRANTS
ON
PEACEFUL
CITIZENS
AND
JUST
SO
WE
DONT
HAVE
ONE
OF
THOSE
ENTERTAINING
SHIFTS
YOU
DESCRIBED
THEM
AS
THE
BATF
EXPECTING
THEM
TO
BE
PEACEFUL

ABOUT
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
TOOL
THE

HIM
