i
certainly
hope
you
dont
have
an
so
sir
what
is
so
supposed
to
signify
i
prefer
the
companionship
of
a
person
not
a
euphemism
oh
do
please
try
not
to
be
ludicrous
sosignificant
other
a
term
i
employed
to
avoid
the
awkward
construction
girlfriend
or
wife
because
if
she
heard
thankfully
you
got
the
gender
right
for
i
am
not
a
deviant
a
deviant
is
someone
who
does
not
fit
an
accepted
norm
by
that
definition
i
would
certainly
be
a
deviant
as
bisexuality
is
not
an
accepted
norm
in
american
society
so
far
this
term
of
course
really
has
no
negative
aspects
inherent
in
its
denotation
i
presume
you
intended
it
as
a
term
of
abuse
its
a
great
pity
you
feel
such
tactics
to
be
necessary
but
hardly
surprising
since
you
have
no
factual
basis
for
your
absurd
beliefs
how
disparaging
you
are
towards
political
minorities
sexual
deviants
do
not
comprise
a
political
minority
may
i
attempt
to
emulate
your
style
of
discourse
with
a
term
of
abuse

the
post
to
which
i
responded
was
a
highly
amusing
one
in
which
you
belittled
homosexuals
for
having
no
political
clout
i
would
be
further
amused
if
you
would
explain
to
me
why
having
no
political
clout
and
constituting
a
political
minority
are
different
and
if
she
had
any
shred
of
selfrespect
shed
be
out
the
door
i
only
associate
with
girls
who
do
indeed
have
selfrespect
but
were
and
yet
you
call
them
girls
the
feminists
would
be
up
in
arms
i
to
find
myself
with
the
sort
who
would
be
inclined
to
head
out
the
door
on
account
of
my
views
regarding
the
aberrant
behavior
known
as
homosexuality
i
would
encourage
her
to
indeed
do
so
and
i
would
further
advise
her
not
to
let
the
door
whack
her
on
the
backside
on
the
way
out
who
needs
such
an
airhead
cough
cough
well
well
you
certainly
are
a
fine
upstanding
fellow
you
are
sir
and
like
many
fine
upstanding
fellows
you
have
the
reading
comprehension
of
a
dyslexic
anteater
perhaps
i
should
have
been
more
explicit
in
pointing
out
that
females
constitute
a
political
minority
in
this
country
when
last
i
checked
and
that
your
obvious
lack
of
respect
for
these
minorities
equates
to
a
lack
of
respect
for
women
that
is
of
course
a
conceptual
stretch
of
logic
but
given
your
slow
uptake
as
de
monstrated
so
far
i
figure
we
should
start
simple
and
work
up
dont
worry
youll
get
it
pretty
soon
they
will
find
themselves
retreating
back
into
the
closet
where
they
belong
dont
count
on
it
sweetheart
oh
i
cant
do
anything
but
count
on
it
after
all
it
is
inevitable
for
it
is
part
of
the
natural
order
of
things
throughout
history
nature
has
always
asserted
itself
dont
be
so
arrogant
as
this
is
very
true
this
bit
about
nature
asserting
itself
homosexuality
has
always
been
a
part
of
human
society
and
always
will
be
for
that
is
the
natural
order
if
youre
naive
enough
to
believe
otherwise
go
right
ahead
well
try
not
to
snicker
too
loudly
behind
your
back
inevitable
chortle
anyone
would
think
you
had
some
idea
what
you
were
talking
about
i
havent
seen
fact
one
from
you
and
until
i
do
you
can
just
dispense
with
the
bullshit
and
tell
us
what
we
already
know
that
youre
a
clueless
little
slime
mold
with
no
concept
of
reality
beyond
the
donna
reed
show
live
a
little
and
then
come
back
and
tell
us
all
about
the
natural
order
of
things
youre
in
a
bubble
and
its
really
going
to
rock
your
world
when
you
come
out
to
assume
that
this
foolish
and
misguided
generation
can
change
the
nature
of
man
where
practically
every
other
generation
has
failed
foolish
and
misguided
oh
this
is
too
much
so
which
religious
figure
do
you
believe
you
are
and
how
do
you
know
so
much
about
the
nature
of
man
youre
almost
too
amusing
to
be
worth
the
effort
of
crushing
your
pealike
brain
greater
men
than
you
havent
been
able
to
do
this
the
above
most
certainly
will
happen
no
matter
how
much
you
may
wish
to
pretend
otherwise
gee
you
sound
awfully
sure
of
yourself
methinks
the
bigot
doth
protest
too
much
admit
it
youre
scared
shitless
that
what
youve
been
spoonfed
all
your
sorry
little
life
was
wrong
and
youre
trying
to
escape
that
fear
by
a
blind
faith
that
you
know
deep
down
is
based
in
nothing
nothing
at
all
go
ahead
clutch
your
unfounded
declaratives
to
your
empty
breast
ignore
the
myriad
of
societies
that
have
accepted
homosexuality
as
equally
valid
or
even
mystical
ignore
the
solid
inescapable
fact
t
hat
weve
existed
as
long
as
humans
have
fear
us
go
ahead
laugh
at
us
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
we
both
know
youre
just
whistling
in
the
dark
theres
one
group
thats
stamped
out
whenever
it
appears
in
any
form
and
thats
the
group
of
boneheads
who
fancy
themselves
morally
superior
youre
in
that
group
and
youre
slowly
and
steadily
being
stamped
out
preach
while
you
can
little
manit
wont
be
long
moreover
im
not
your
sweetheart
thats
the
first
truth
youve
told
so
far
i
dont
hate
hets
sir
im
bisexual
and
i
embrace
man
and
womankind
alike
i
have
nothing
against
those
who
dont
understand
my
love
but
you
deny
its
potency
and
validity
you
would
crush
us
all
human
beings
to
a
one
in
your
imagined
divinity
its
fools
like
you
that
stir
my
ireidiots
with
the
small
minds
who
cant
think
for
themselves
who
know
nothing
about
how
the
real
world
operates
and
who
hate
because
they
are
told
what
to
do
and
do
it
like
sheep
who
hate
everyone
who
refuses
to
be
a
sheep
youre
not
part
of
the
norm
youre
part
of
a
minorityyes
a
minoritywith
supreme
oerweening
arrogance
your
hubris
will
topple
because
it
always
has
because
those
with
intelligence
know
it
to
be
a
clowns
costume
wow
that
was
pretentious
i
sometimes
wonder
why
i
waste
my
talents
on
zeroes
like
you
i
really
have
no
interest
in
continuing
this
effortless
discussion
after
all
this
is
for
me
the
proverbial
battle
of
wits
with
an
unarmed
opponent
come
back
with
some
swordsie
factsand
we
shall
do
battle
till
then
begone
from
my
sight
drewcifer
ps
you
were
very
entertaining
however
have
you
considered
taking
this
on
the
road
i
hear
escapism
is
back
in
