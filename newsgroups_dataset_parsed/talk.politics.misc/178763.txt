mike
van
pelt
says
there
is
something
terribly
wrong
however
with
a
culture
which
condemns
attacks
and
all
too
often
kills
any
of
its
members
who
attempt
to
get
an
education
my
mother
is
an
elementary
school
teacher
and
she
tells
me
that
she
and
her
african
american
collegues
are
frustrated
to
tears
by
the
fact
that
any
african
american
child
who
attempts
to
do
well
in
school
and
get
an
education
is
accused
by
hisher
peers
of
trying
to
be
white
and
is
beaten
bullied
and
tormented
by
them
it
goes
beyond
each
passing
grade
on
a
test
earning
a
beating
in
my
mothers
school
one
of
the
most
promising
young
students
who
happened
to
be
african
american
had
her
throat
cut
by
one
of
these
young
thugs
you
know
you
have
a
point
here
but
dont
stop
with
african
americans
when
i
was
in
high
school
in
the
early
on
various
occasions
i
had
knives
pulled
on
me
had
friends
who
were
stabbed
and
i
was
beaten
up
repeatedly
by
those
that
couldnt
accept
me
as
different
and
dont
let
the
teachers
off
the
hook
either
on
many
many
occasions
there
were
teachers
that
either
resented
me
or
were
too
scared
out
of
their
wits
by
the
bullies
to
even
stop
the
people
who
attacked
me
and
they
would
just
watch
quietly
all
of
this
was
in
a
nice
white
middle
class
high
school
in
fact
we
were
so
nice
and
white
that
we
made
sure
that
the
one
black
kid
in
my
class
was
unable
to
go
to
the
prom
with
his
white
girlfriend
this
isnt
a
race
thing
its
the
way
public
schools
seem
to
be
run
id
hate
to
be
in
high
school
right
now
at
least
i
didnt
have
to
deal
with
guns
just
the
roving
psychodrugdorks
and
the
jocks
withoutafuturebutwithplentyoftestosterone
id
separate
everyone
who
wants
to
learn
from
these
assholes
but
hey
the
valuelessness
of
learning
and
glorification
of
jocks
is
an
american
tradition
you
think
anything
is
going
to
change
if
you
have
kids
take
em
out
of
the
public
school
system
and
educate
them
yourself
thats
what
ill
do
if
i
ever
have
them
i
wouldnt
wish
what
i
went
through
upon
any
kid
maybe
on
some
of
their
parents
though
