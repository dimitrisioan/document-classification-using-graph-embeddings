serious
q
has
he

janet

or
yesterday
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
hes

q
why

ms
myers
it
will
be
at
the
photo
in
the
rose
garden
q
he
will
talk
about
waco
at
that
ms
myers
yes
hell
have
something
to
say
q
is
that
something
we
can
take
live
ms
myers
i
think
it
will
be
brief
we
can
talk
a
little
later
about
the
exact
structure
as
we
work
it
out
but
i
dont
know
if
its
something
youd
want
to
take
live
q
will
he
take
questions
on
waco
at
that
time
as
well
ms
myers
hell
probably
take
a
few
q
is
there
any
reason
why
he
hasnt
talked
to
the
attorney
general
ms
myers
ill
have
to
doublecheck
i
dont
know
that
he
hasnt
talked
to
her
this
morning
q
and
she
didnt
come
here
this
morning
to
see
him
or
anyone
else
ms
myers
no
q
and
he
didnt
talk
yesterday
q
whats
the
reaction
to
her
resignation
statement
that
she
made
last
night
ms
myers
she
was
asked
a
question
about
it
and
she
answered
the
question
the
president
has
absolutely
no
intention
of
asking
for
the
attorney
generals
resignation
he
stands
behind
her
percent
as
you
know
he
was
informed
about
the
decision
he
takes
full
responsibility
for
that
and
stands
percent
behind
attorney
general
reno
q
the
question
now
arises
yesterday
we
were
told
that
he
was
briefed
on
this
but
we
never
got
a
firm
idea
of
how
much
he
knew
of
what
the
plan
was
and
the
justification
for
the
plan
and
the
justification
of
the
timing
was
he
fully
informed
on
all
of
that
all
of
this
about
the
increasing
levels
of
violence
inside
the
compound
that
made
them
want
to
go
now
the
feeling
that
nothing
else
was
going
to
succeed
et
cetera
ms
myers
he
talked
with
the
attorney
general
about
the
decision
about
she
talked
to
him
about
the
factors
that
led
to
her
decision
he
raised
no
objections
he
supports
her
decision
to
go
forward
with
it
he
was
fully
briefed
q
of
course
hindsight
is
but
looking
back
now
does
the
president
does
the
white
house
feel
that
the
decision
he
signed
off
on
proved
to
be
the
right
way
to
go
when
you
look
at
what
actually
happened
ms
myers
i
think
everybody
feels
bad
when
life
is
lost
but
i
dont
think
that
that
is
reason
to
secondguess
the
decision
he
stands
behind
the
decision
that
was
made
he
was
informed
about
it
he
was
fully
briefed
about
it
and
he
stands
percent
behind
the
attorney
general
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
its
a
difficult
operation
and
theres
it
had
already
gone
on
for
more
than
seven
weeks
four
federal
agents
had
lost
their
lives
in
the
line
of
duty
lets
not
forget
that
this
was
a
very
difficult
situation
and
all
the
decisions
involved
were
very
difficult
but
all
the
agents
on
the
ground
the
fbi
the
justice
department
all
recommended
moving
forward
with
this
they
thought
given
the
circumstances
it
was
the
best
possible
course
of
action
theres
just
no
point
in
second
guessing
those
decisions
now
i
think
that
theres
a
reason
q
why
not
they
have
to
ms
myers
no
not
to
secondguess
the
decisions
i
think
its
important
to
take
a
look
at
it
to
have
an
investigation
i
think
the
president
will
talk
some
about
that
later
today
but
at
this
from
this
vantage
point
to
secondguess
those
decisions
its
not
useful
q
you
sound
like
hes
going
to
order
an
investigation
of
what
happened
and
whether
ms
myers
i
think
hell
have
more
to
say
about
that
later
yes
q
he
will
order
an
investigation
ms
myers
hell
have
more
yes
hell
have
more
to
say
about
an
investigation
q
what
kind
of
investigation
ms
myers
hell
have
more
to
say
about
it
later
q
but
in
the
monday
morning
quarterbacking
surely
there
is
some
soulsearching
now
as
to
whether
it
was
the
right
decision
you
cant
say
that
we
did
the
best
we
could
when
it
turned
out
to
be
a
rather
a
debacle
ms
myers
i
think
well
obviously
well
review
the
situation
and
all
the
factors
that
lead
to
a
very
tragic
outcome
i
dont
think
anybody
disputes
that
the
outcome
was
tragic
but
again
the
president
stands
behind
the
decisions
that
were
made
and
well
take
a
look
at
the
factors
that
contributed
to
that
q
what
was
the
fbi
directors
role
in
this
ms
myers
well
he
was
obviously
involved
in
setting
up
the
operation
he
signed
off
on
it
as
did
the
agents
that
were
on
the
ground
that
were
working
with
him
i
dont
believe
he
spoke
to
the
president
but
ill
doublecheck
that
q
but
he
was
very
closely
involved
in
every
aspect
of
planning
and
so
forth
ms
myers
i
would
refer
you
to
the
fbi
on
exactly
what
aspects
he
was
involved
with
q
will
janet
reno
be
coming
over
to
the
white
house
today
ms
myers
theres
no
planned
meeting
i
dont
believe
that
shell
be
here
q
she
wont
be
at
this
event
at
pm
ms
myers
no
no
plans
to
be
q
do
you
think
that
theres
going
to
be
a
jumping
on
on
the
part
of
political
opposition
to
make
something
out
of
this
in
terms
of
to
the
presidents
detriment
politically
ms
myers
well
i
would
certainly
hope
that
people
wouldnt
try
to
use
this
tragedy
for
political
reasons
obviously
i
think
again
that
its
useful
to
look
at
the
facts
to
reevaluate
the
facts
and
i
think
the
president
will
move
forward
with
that
but
i
think
people
understand
that
this
was
a
difficult
series
of
decisions
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
situation
that
it
was
caused
by
a
man
who
was
a
cult
leader
who
was
involved
in
the
death
of
four
federal
agents
and
i
think
its
most
tragic
that
a
lot
of
innocent
children
lost
their
lives
in
this
i
dont
think
anybody
disputes
the
tragedy
of
the
outcome
q
dee
dee
what
was
the
white
house
role
in
handling
the
i
guess
public
relations
aspect
in
the
aftermath
who
was
talking
who
here
at
the
white
house
was
talking
with
people
at
justice
to
set
up
renos
news
conference
to
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
ms
myers
i
think
the
attorney
general
handled
her
end
of
the
situation
herself
and
made
the
decision
to
go
ahead
with
the
news
conference
once
there
was
a
point
at
which
there
was
enough
information
i
think
to
talk
with
some
accuracy
about
what
had
transpired
during
the
day
obviously
people
here
at
a
number
of
levels
were
keeping
in
touch
with
people
at
the
justice
department
and
at
the
fbi
to
try
to
keep
informed
about
what
was
happening
there
q
but
reno
said
that
she
didnt
talk
to
the
president
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
indication
she
hadnt
talked
to
anybody
at
the
white
house
so
who
ms
myers
there
were
people
talking
on
a
staffto
staff
level
q
i
understand
but
who
at
the
justice
department
was
handling
that
for
reno
who
was
talking
to
the
white
house
ms
myers
there
were
a
number
of
people
as
you
know
webb
hubbell
is
the
liaison
to
the
white
house
and
i
know
he
talked
to
a
number
of
people
here
there
were
a
number
of
people
at
a
number
of
different
levels
involved
i
dont
want
to
get
into
exactly
who
had
what
conversations
with
whom
but
there
were
a
number
of
conversations
obviously
the
justice
department
was
working
to
keep
the
white
house
informed
the
press
informed
to
the
best
of
its
ability
as
events
unfolded
throughout
the
day
q
did
webb
hubbell
talk
to
the
president
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
i
dont
know
if
he
talked
he
may
have
at
one
point
q
and
was
the
white
house
role
just
to
seek
information
about
what
happened
or
was
it
to
direct
the
public
information
campaign
that
followed
ms
myers
it
was
both
to
keep
abreast
of
the
situation
so
the
president
could
be
on
top
of
it
but
i
think
the
justice
department
managed
its
press
relations
on
it
we
were
obviously
very
interested
in
what
was
happening
there
throughout
the
day
and
the
president
was
following
it
very
closely
throughout
the
day
q
dee
dee
on
that
though
if
the
president
was
following
it
so
closely
and
he
had
talked
the
night
before
with
janet
reno
why
wouldnt
he
talk
to
her
at
all
since
then
ms
myers
again
i
dont
know
if
hes
talked
to
her
this
morning
again
hes
kept
fully
aware
of
what
has
been
going
on
throughout
the
day
he
stands
percent
behind
her
decisions
hes
been
fully
supportive
of
her
as
he
said
yesterday
morning
before
events
transpired
and
yesterday
afternoon
in
a
written
statement
q
but
wouldnt
he
want
to
convey
those
thoughts
to
her
personally
yesterday
ms
myers
one
more
time
i
dont
know
if
theyve
spoken
this
morning
q
no
yesterday
q
clearly
theres
a
perception
that
she
was
left
hung
out
to
dry
all
day
yesterday
ms
myers
thats
just
not
true
i
think
we
said
throughout
the
day
that
the
president
takes
full
responsibility
that
he
stands
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
the
president
stands
foursquare
behind
the
attorney
general
on
this
he
accepts
full
responsibility
for
the
events
that
transpired
he
believes
that
janet
reno
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
acted
as
best
they
could
given
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
that
were
evident
at
the
time
i
dont
know
what
else
he
can
say
to
show
that
he
supports
her
percent
q
one
of
the
best
indications
of
that
is
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
tell
her
ms
myers
again
i
dont
know
whether
theyve
spoken
this
morning
q
why
cant
we
find
out
ms
myers
well
we
can
i
cant
do
it
standing
here
right
now
q
youve
got
six
people
here
all
theyve
got
to
do
is
pick
up
the
phone
ms
myers
helen
well
get
back
to
you
q
dee
dee
when
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
on
sunday
is
it
safe
to
assume
that
either
she
volunteered
or
he
inquired
about
whether
there
was
a
possible
downside
to
increasing
pressure
on
the
davidians
ms
myers
i
think
that
they
discussed
the
situation
again
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
specific
details
of
what
exactly
she
told
him
but
i
think
that
he
was
aware
of
the
risks
involved
q
dee
dee
the
president
yesterday
morning
said
it
was
entirely
her
decision
she
then
said
that
she
told
him
what
was
happening
and
he
said
okay
does
the
president
regard
it
that
he
gave
the
goahead
or
that
she
gave
the
goahead
ms
myers
i
think
what
they
both
said
yesterday
was
that
she
made
a
decision
based
on
all
the
available
facts
she
informed
him
about
that
and
he
raised
no
objections
again
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
about
that
q
and
he
said
okay
the
issue
is
over
the
responsibility
ms
myers
he
said
okay
q
does
okay
mean
ms
myers
the
president
accepts
ultimate
responsibility
q
dee
dee
the
presidents
investigation
that
hes
going
to
announce
would
that
be
conducted
by
someone
outside
the
administration
ms
myers
no
q
it
would
be
internal
is
it
meant
to
preclude
any
congressional
investigation
ms
myers
no
its
meant
simply
to
follow
up
on
the
incidents
that
occurred
yesterday
q
and
you
would
i
assume
therefore
cooperate
fully
with
any
congressional
hearings
that
would
be
held
ms
myers
to
the
best
of
our
ability
q
dee
dee
there
are
two
reports
out
this
morning
one
that
the
justice
department
or
fbi
or
whomever
apparently
had
a
bug
planted
inside
the
complex
and
the
other
is
that
the
children
may
have
been
injected
with
some
kind
of
poison
that
may
have
either
left
them
unconscious
or
maybe
even
killed
them
before
the
fire
what
do
you
know
about
those
two
ms
myers
nothing
more
than
ive
seen
in
news
accounts
this
morning
we
may
get
more
on
it
later
but
at
this
point
i
know
im
not
sure
anybody
knows
any
more
than
what
was
reported
by
people
who
came
out
of
the
compound
q
has
the
president
received
any
report
today
in
terms
of
fatalities
and
actually
what
was
going
on
what
theyve
been
able
to
find
out
on
in
the
compound
now
ms
myers
hes
been
briefed
i
dont
think
that
theyve
gotten
into
the
compound
yet
they
were
still
waiting
for
it
to
cool
off
i
dont
think
theres
much
beyond
whats
been
reported
in
the
news
accounts
but
he
has
been
kept
uptodate
on
it
q
dee
dee
the
president
stands
behind
attorney
general
reno
but
does
he
feel
that
she
perhaps
got
bad
advice
from
the
socalled
experts
ms
myers
he
believes
that
she
made
he
stands
behind
the
decision
that
she
made
it
was
the
unanimous
decision
of
her
advisors
of
the
fbi
of
the
agents
on
the
ground
and
he
supports
that
q
what
about
the
validity
of
the
decisions
made
on
the
ground
does
he
back
those
ms
myers
hes
not
going
to
secondguess
decisions
made
q
dee
dee
you
just
said
he
stands
behind
the
decision
which
she
made
normally
in
a
situation
like
this
the
president
says
i
made
the
decision
but
youre
saying
she
made
the
decision
ms
myers
im
saying
that
the
president
was
briefed
about
the
decision
he
okayed
it
and
he
accepts
full
responsibility
for
it
q
but
then
why
do
you
keep
using
the
terminology
the
decision
that
she
made
rather
than
the
decision
that
he
made
ms
myers
because
as
he
said
yesterday
she
evaluated
the
facts
based
on
evidence
presented
to
her
by
justice
department
and
fbi
which
is
part
of
the
justice
department
and
made
a
decision
and
then
briefed
the
president
on
that
decision
that
is
how
the
chain
of
command
works
she
briefed
him
he
signed
off
on
it
the
operation
went
forward
and
the
president
accepts
full
responsibility
q
in
that
chain
of
command
analogy
there
i
want
to
go
back
to
sessions
a
moment
do
you
know
if
this
was
a
plan
that
came
through
him
to
reno
or
was
it
presented
to
her
around
him
or
with
his
involvement
what
was
his
involvement
ms
myers
again
youd
have
to
go
to
the
justice
department
for
the
specific
interaction
between
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
q
does
the
president
stand
behind
director
sessions
ms
myers
he
supports
again
i
dont
know
how
many
different
ways
i
can
say
this
he
supports
the
decisions
made
by
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
he
fully
supports
the
attorney
general
in
this
im
not
stepping
away
from
the
director
of
the
fbi
i
want
to
but
janet
reno
is
the
one
who
briefed
him
the
one
who
made
the
decisions
as
the
head
of
the
justice
department
as
you
know
the
director
of
the
fbi
reports
to
the
attorney
general
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
she
informed
the
president
about
those
decisions
he
okayed
it
he
didnt
raise
any
objections
to
it
and
he
accepts
full
responsibility
q
do
you
have
based
on
what
you
know
here
at
the
white
house
any
concerns
about
william
sessions
performance
during
this
ms
myers
nothing
to
suggest
that
no
q
along
those
same
lines
just
in
your
initial
review
of
the
situation
how
much
do
you
think
the
problems
might
have
come
from
not
having
a
justice
department
thats
fully
staffed
and
having
an
fbi
director
who
is
still
quite
uncertain
about
his
status
ms
myers
i
just
dont
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
think
the
agents
on
the
ground
the
operation
went
forward
im
not
going
to
speculate
on
that
q
did
the
white
house
express
any
alarm
that
janet
reno
chose
to
speak
to
the
live
network
media
before
she
chose
to
speak
to
clinton
ms
myers
no
she
was
carrying
forward
her
responsibility
to
inform
the
public
about
the
events
of
yesterday
i
think
she
did
a
very
admirable
job
the
president
agrees
with
that
q
before
sunday
how
often
was
the
president
briefed
on
the
situation
in
waco
ms
myers
he
was
kept
updated
on
a
regular
basis
on
a
daily
basis
q
who
briefed
the
president
ms
myers
well
im
not
going
to
get
into
exactly
who
what
conversations
he
had
with
whom
but
he
was
kept
uptodate
on
the
events
in
waco
he
has
daily
briefings
on
a
number
of
issues
q
no
no
was
this
a
regular
briefing
conducted
by
a
white
house
staff
person
or
was
it
by
a
justice
department
person
ms
myers
hes
briefed
regularly
by
a
white
house
staff
on
a
number
of
issues
again
im
not
going
to
get
into
exactly
who
briefs
him
on
what
subjects
q
another
subject
q
on
another
subject
q
now
were
going
to
do
gays
in
the
military
laughter
ms
myers
i
welcome
it
q
how
close
are
you
to
signing
the
biodiversity
treaty
ms
myers
as
you
know
the
presidents
giving
a
speech
on
earth
day
tomorrow
well
have
more
to
say
about
it
then
q
any
details
on
where
or
when
that
speech
is
yet
ms
myers
its
at
am
and
i
dont
know
where
yet
q
dee
dee
is
this
a
major
policy
address
how
would
you
characterize
the
speech
tomorrow
ms
myers
i
would
characterize
it
as
a
earth
day
speech
i
wouldnt
look
for
any
major
departures
from
his
past
positions
on
these
things
but
again
i
dont
want
to
get
too
much
into
what
hes
going
to
talk
about
tomorrow
q
on
or
off
campus
q
is
this
at
a
location
outside
the
white
house
ms
myers
it
will
be
somewhere
in
washington
we
dont
know
exactly
where
yet
q
dee
dee
what
foreign
leaders
has
the
president
talked
to
since
friday
on
the
situation
in
bosnia
ms
myers
only
prime
minister
major
and
again
hell
try
to
reach
president
mitterrand
again
this
morning
q
david
owen
said
yesterday
and
joe
biden
said
today
both
of
them
agree
that
the
peace
process
is
not
going
to
work
that
the
serbs
are
not
going
to
sign
on
does
the
administration
still
believe
that
it
can
work
and
that
they
will
sign
on
ms
myers
obviously
the
ultimate
goal
is
some
sort
of
peaceful
resolution
to
the
conflict
in
bosnia
as
you
know
the
administration
is
considering
a
wide
variety
of
options
at
this
point
the
situation
there
in
and
around
srebrenica
and
the
rest
of
eastern
bosnia
is
quite
serious
and
the
president
will
meet
with
his
bosnian
advisors
today
and
continue
to
press
forward
on
this
q
is
that
a
question
theyre
going
to
try
to
be
deciding
whether
or
not
the
peace
plan
remains
viable
ms
myers
again
theyll
be
reviewing
a
number
of
options
including
the
peace
plan
q
does
the
group
that
hes
meeting
with
today
include
reg
bartholomew
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
hes
here
but
it
will
be
among
the
usual
secretary
christopher
secretary
aspin
general
powell
q
dee
dee
do
you
have
anything
on
the
apparent
encounter
by
us
over
bosnia
today
some
aircraft
violating
the
nofly
zone
ms
myers
no
i
dont
ill
get
back
to
you
on
that
q
will
the
president
be
meeting
with
every
one
of
the
leaders
coming
to
town
for
the
holocaust
museum
ms
myers
he
will
hell
be
meeting
as
you
know
with
vaclav
havel
today
and
with
lech
walesa
tomorrow
and
then
with
the
rest
of
the
group
tomorrow
afternoon
q
as
a
group
or
one
by
one
ms
myers
i
believe
its
as
a
group
now
havel
and
walesa
asked
for
meetings
early
and
these
have
been
on
the
agenda
for
quite
some
time
but
he
will
meet
with
all
of
the
foreign
heads
of
state
that
are
here
q
dee
dee
has
the
president
decided
whether
he
supports
the
gay
and
lesbian
civil
rights
act
and
has
anything
been
worked
out
for
him
to
address
the
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
i
think
hell
probably
have
a
letter
or
some
kind
of
a
statement
to
the
march
we
havent
worked
out
the
exact
details
of
that
q
not
a
live
phone
hookup
ms
myers
probably
not
given
the
logistics
of
getting
to
boston
the
speech
as
you
know
is
at
pm
the
answer
to
the
other
part
of
your
question
is
no
he
hasnt
taken
a
position
on
it
q
you
said
that
speech
in
boston
was
at
pm
ms
myers
i
believe
so
yes
q
do
you
know
what
its
on
ms
myers
well
still
working
out
q
general
vesseys
coming
back
tonight
from
vietnam
when
will
he
be
meeting
with
the
president
ms
myers
no
specific
meeting
is
scheduled
well
talk
to
him
at
some
point
and
see
we
look
forward
to
his
report
but
exactly
how
hell
make
that
report
is
unclear
q
so
hes
not
going
to
come
immediately
to
the
white
house
ms
myers
no
q
the
aids
czar
how
close
are
you
ms
myers
still
working
on
it
q
drug
czar
q
do
you
expect
it
before
the
march
ms
myers
i
dont
have
a
time
line
on
it
q
did
the
president
ask
senator
mitchell
to
try
the
lloyd
cutler
ploy
to
break
the
filibuster
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
q
why
not
ms
myers
hes
just
not
going
to
q
are
senate
democrats
here
at
this
hour
ms
myers
no
thats
tomorrow
tomorrow
at
am
q
update
on
the
stimulus
possible
scaling
down
ms
myers
as
you
know
the
senate
will
vote
on
amendments
today
well
continue
to
talk
the
president
is
committed
to
some
kind
of
a
jobs
package
wed
like
to
see
it
passed
and
well
continue
in
conversations
throughout
the
day
and
see
where
we
end
up
q
when
this
briefing
is
over
can
you
give
us
word
through
the
speaker
or
whatever
whether
the
presidents
talked
to
janet
reno
ms
myers
well
be
happy
to
q
its
become
a
pressing
question
for
the
last
several
hours
ms
myers
no
just
this
minute
that
ive
been
here
and
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
follow
up
on
it
helen
q
does
he
have
an
opinion
on
hatfield
ms
myers
i
mean
obviously
he
prefers
he
offered
a
compromise
package
of
billion
he
believes
that
thats
the
best
alternative
believes
that
hes
obviously
willing
to
take
a
second
look
at
the
package
and
i
think
the
senate
will
vote
on
that
today
and
were
hopeful
that
the
presidents
bill
which
will
be
the
mitchell
amendment
will
be
the
one
that
will
be
approved
q
dee
dee
is
there
any
white
house
official
that
will
be
at
the
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
somebody
will
be
there
representing
the
president
i
dont
know
who
yet
q
well
has
it
been
decided
how
hes
going
to
address
is
it
going
to
be
a
videotape
or
a
phone
call
ms
myers
i
think
it
will
probably
be
a
letter
but
there
hasnt
been
a
final
decision
on
that
yet
q
the
official
will
read
the
letter
is
that
what
it
sounds
like
ms
myers
correct
q
lloyd
bentsen
came
in
here
this
morning
do
you
know
what
was
that
about
was
that
about
this
waco
thing
ms
myers
no
actually
it
wasnt
it
may
have
come
up
but
it
was
about
economic
issues
q
on
health
care
is
the
of
may
still
the
target
ms
myers
thats
still
the
target
q
and
theres
talk
about
a
joint
session
of
congress
speech
at
the
end
of
may
ms
myers
we
havent
resolved
exactly
how
the
president
will
present
the
health
care
plan
to
the
people
i
wouldnt
rule
that
out
as
an
option
but
no
decisions
have
been
made

edt
