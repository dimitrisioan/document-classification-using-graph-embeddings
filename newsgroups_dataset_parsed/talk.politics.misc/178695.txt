THESE
TWO
PARAGRAPHS
ARE
FROM
TWO
DIFFERENT
POSTS
IN
SPLICING
THEM
TOGETHER
IT
IS
NOT
MY
INTENTION
TO
CHANGE
STEVES
MEANING
OR
MISREPRESENT
HIM
IN
ANY
WAY
I
DONT
THINK
IVE
DONE
SO
AS
NOTED
IN
ANOTHER
THREAD
LIMITING
GOVT
THE
PROBLEM
LIBERTARIANS
FACE
IS
INSURING
THAT
THE
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
THEY
SEEK
DOES
NOT
BECOME
THE
TOOL
OF
PRIVATE
INTERESTS
TO
PURSUE
THEIR
OWN
AGENDA
IT
IS
A
FAILURE
OF
LIBERTARIANISM
IF
THE
IDEOLOGY
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
ANY
REASONABLE
WAY
TO
RESTRAIN
SUCH
ACTIONS
OTHER
THAN
UTOPIAN
DREAMS
JUST
AS
MARXISM
FAILS
TO
SPECIFY
HOW
PURE
COMMUNISM
IS
TO
BE
ACHIEVED
AND
THE
STATE
IS
TO
WITHER
AWAY
LIBERTARIANS
FREQUENTLY
FAIL
TO
SHOW
HOW
WEAKENING
THE
POWER
OF
THE
STATE
WILL
RESULT
IN
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
PATRICKS
EXAMPLE
OF
ANTICOMPETITIVE
REGULATIONS
FOR

DEALERS
DELETED
HERES
WHAT
I
SEE
LIBERTARIANISM
OFFERING
YOU
THIS
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
ME
TO
BE
A
UTOPIAN
DREAM
BUT
BASIC
HUMAN
DECENCY
AND
COMMON
SENSE
A
REAL
GRASSROOTS
EXAMPLE
OF
FREEDOM
AND
LIBERTY
AND
YES
NOT
HAVING
A
FEW
PEOPLE
ACTING
AS
OUR
MASTERS
APPROVING
OR
REJECTING
EACH
OF
OUR
BASIC
TRANSACTIONS
WITH
EACH
OTHER
DOES
STRIKE
ME
AS
A
WONDERFUL
WAY
TO
IMPROVE
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
THANKS
AWFULLY
PATRICK
LET
ME
TRY
TO
DRAG
THIS
DISCUSSION
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
ISSUES
AS
IVE
NOTED
BEFORE
IM
NOT
NECESSARILY
DISPUTING
THE
BENEFITS
OF
ELIMINATING
ANTICOMPETITIVE
LEGISLATION
WITH
REGARD
TO
AUTO
DEALERS
BARBERS
ETC
ONE
NEED
NOT
HOWEVER
SWALLOW
THE
ENTIRE
LIBERTARIAN
AGENDA
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THIS
END
JUST
BECAUSE
ONE
GRANTS
THE
BENEFITS
OF
ALLOWING
ANYONE
WHO
WISHES
TO
CUT
HAIR
TO
SELL
HISHER
SERVICES
WITHOUT
REGULATION
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THE
SAME
UNREGULATED
BARBERS
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
BLEED
PEOPLE
AS
A
MEDICAL
SERVICE
WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
AS
SOMEMANY
LIBERTARIANS
WOULD
ARGUE
ON
A
CASE
BY
CASE
BASIS
THE
COSTBENEFIT
RATIO
OF
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
IS
OBVIOUSLY
WORTHWHILE
THE
LIBERTARIAN
AGENDA
HOWEVER
DOES
NOT
CALL
FOR
THIS
ASSESSMENT
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
COSTS
OF
REGULATION
OF
ANY
KIND
ALWAYS
OUTWEIGH
ITS
BENEFITS
THIS
APPROACH
AVOIDS
ALL
SORTS
OF
DIFFICULT
ANALYSIS
BUT
IT
STRIKES
MANY
OF
THE
REST
OF
US
AS
DOGMATIC
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
I
HAVE
NO
OBJECTION
TO
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
MEDICAL
CARE
EDUCATION
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
OR
LOCAL
POLICE
THAT
SUGGESTS
A
FREE
MARKET
CAN
PROVIDE
A
MORE
EFFECTIVE
EFFICIENT
MEANS
OF
ACCOMPLISHING
SOCIAL
OBJECTIVES
THAN
IS
PROVIDED
THROUGH
STATIST
APPROACHES
WITH
SOME
NOTABLE
EXCEPTIONS
HOWEVER
I
DO
NOT
SEE
SUCH
NITTYGRITTY
WORTHWHILE
ANALYSIS
BEING
CARRIED
OUT
