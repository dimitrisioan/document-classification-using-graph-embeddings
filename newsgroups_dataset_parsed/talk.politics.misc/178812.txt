FURY
OF
MOTHER
NATURE
CLEARLY
MAN
HAS
A
LONG
WAY
TO
GO
TO
MATCH
NATURE
AS
A
DESPOILER
OF
THE
ENVIRONMENT
BULLSHIT
HOW
MANY
LAKES
HAVE
CEASED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SUPPORT
LIFE
FROM
PURELY
NATURAL
POLLUTION
MAN
HAS
ALREADY
DONE
THIS
TO
SCORES
OF
LAKES
ALSO
MUCH
OF
THE
DEGREDATION
YOU
CITE
WAS
DONE
BY
COWS
AND
PIGS
YOU
HAVE
PERHAPS
HEARD
OF
THE
DEAD
SEA
I
MAY
BE
WRONG
BUT
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
NOT
MISNAMED
AND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
HUMANS
HAD
A
HAND
IN
IT
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
SINCE
THE
GREAT
CEDAR
FORESTS
OF
LEBANON
WERE
BUT
A
MEMORY
BY
THE
TIME
OF
CHRIST
IF
NOT
EARLIER
BUT
MORE
ON
THE
POINT
WHILE
NATURE
IS
THE
MAY
BE
THE
MORE
PROLIFIC
DESPOILER
MAN
IS
CERTAINLY
THE
MORE
CREATIVE
WE
HAVE
TO
OUR
CREDIT
PESTICIDES
AND
HEAVY
METALS
NOT
TO
MENTION
RADIOACTIVITY
WHICH
IS
SO
WONDERFULLY
PERSISTENT
AND
FATAL
NOT
THAT
WE
INVENTED
RADIOACTIVITY
OR
HEAVY
METALS
WE
ONLY
CONCENTRATED
THEM
SO
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BE
A
MORE
LETHAL
THREAT
IN
GENERAL
I
FIND
MR
BACONS
ARGUMENTS
RHETORICAL
DEVOID
OF
SENSE
AND
THEREFORE
TRIVIAL
BTW
IS
THERE
ANY
REASON
THIS
DISCUSSION
IS
ON
PHLMISC
SO
LONG
JR
