last
night
i
heard
something
about
bill
clintons
sister
being
involved
in
a
marijuana
bust
and
the
news
being
suppressed
i
also
heard
something
about
her
being
an
excon
this
source
is
not
reliable
though
it
was
a
collagebooklet
advertising
a
local
band
can
anyone
on
the
net
verify
this
or
provide
more
details
im
surprised
i
havent
seen
anything
about
this
in
this
newsgroup
also
does
anyone
know
what
happened
to
the
charges
that
shalala
was
a
regular
pot
smoker
when
she
was
in
college
this
ghastly
accusation
was
reported
on
cnn
streamline
news
the
day
she
was
nominated
then
i
never
heard
anything
about
it
again
its
almost
enough
to
make
me
want
to
start
an
actup
type
campaign
to
invade
the
privacy
of
closet
smokers
if
only
this
type
of
publicity
didnt
violate
peoples
rights
