WHAT
EXACTLY
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
SAY
AND
WHY
WERE
THERE
NO
FIREENGINES
WITHIN
A
MILE
OF
THE
COMPOUND
BECAUSE
THE
GUN
LOONIES
WERE
FIRING
ON

CALIBRE
IS
MUCH
SMALLER
BUT
THE

RANGE
SOUNDS
ABOUT
RIGHT
MAYBE
HE
JUST
GOT
THE
TWO
CONFUSED
THE
FBIS
REASONING
WAS
SOUND
BUT
THE
NOTE
FROM
PHB
WAS
FACTUALLY
WRONG
