IS

I
WAS
PLEASED
THAT
THE
RESTORATION
OF
THE
BOURBON
DE
BOURBONS
TO
WHAT
TREE
DID
YOU
JUST
CLIMB
DOWN
FROM
THE
CHURCH
IS
AN
OPRESSIVE
FARCE
WHICH
DESTROYS
CULTURES
IM
NOT
KNOCKING
RELIGIOUS
MORALITY
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
AMERICANS
TAKE
THEIR
RELIGION
TOO
SERIOUSLY
TO
THE
POINT
OF
TRYING
TO
CONVERT
ANYONE
OR
ANYTHING
TO
THEIR
PARTICULAR
SECT
ITS
A

NOT
SALVATION

IT
LOOKES
LIKE
YOURE
PRETTY
HOPPED
UP

SELFRIGHTOUSNESS
NEVER

EH
NO

THE

PROCEDURE
IS
TO
ACCEPT
SOME
PART
OF
THE
OPPOSITIONS
ARGUEMENT
AND
RUN
WITH
IT
UNTIL
ONE
GOES
BEYOND
RATIONAL
THOUGHT
AND
THEN
RING

ZB
THE
IDEA
OF
A
MINIMUM
WAGE
IS
CONSIDERED
A
GOOD
ONE
AND
IN
THESE
TIMES
OF
ECONOMIC
DIFFICULTY
THE
WASHINGTON
LEGISLATURE
IS
PROPOSSING
TO
RAISE
THE
STATE
MINWAGE
FROM
THE
FEDERAL
LEVEL
TO
FIFTEEN
CENTS
OVER
OREGONS
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
INCREASE
DOES
NOT
KEEP
PACE
WITH
INFLATION
THAT
THE
MINIMUM
WAGE
SHOULD
BE
TO
BY
MY
FIGURES
SO
IT
IS
PROPOSED
THAT
WE
RAISE
THE
MINIMUM
WAGE
TO
PER
HOUR
BY
JULY
AND
THEN
GIVE
A
COST
OF
LIVING
INCREASE
EVERY
JULY
AND
ANYONE
WHO
DOESNT

IT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
