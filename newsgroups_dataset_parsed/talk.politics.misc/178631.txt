quoting

just
drieux
to
all
dated
my
point
if
it
alluded
you
is
that
as
long
as
the
usa
remains
in
the
state
of
rebellion
against
gods
divinely
appointed
vicar
over
these
colonies
what
more
can
you
expect
from

wonderful

i
was
pleased
that
the
restoration
of
the
bourbon
de
bourbons
to
what
tree
did
you
just
climb
down
from
the
church
is
an
opressive
farce
which
destroys
cultures
im
not
knocking
religious
morality
but
i
think
that
americans
take
their
religion
too
seriously
to
the
point
of
trying
to
convert
anyone
or
anything
to
their
particular
sect
its
a
question
of
power
and
not
salvation
all
monotheistic
religions
breed
intoleraance
into
their
flock
islam
judaism
and
christianity
religion
is
not
the
opiate
of
the
masses
fanaticism
is
and
brother
it
lookes
like
youre
pretty
hopped
up
on
your
own
selfrightousness
never
heard
of
arguement
by
absurdity
eh
no
also
called
sarcasm
the
usual
procedure
is
to
accept
some
part
of
the
oppositions
arguement
and
run
with
it
until
one
goes
beyond
rational
thought
and
then
ring
the
changes
zb
the
idea
of
a
minimum
wage
is
considered
a
good
one
and
in
these
times
of
economic
difficulty
the
washington
legislature
is
propossing
to
raise
the
state
minwage
from
the
federal
level
to
fifteen
cents
over
oregons
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
increase
does
not
keep
pace
with
inflation
that
the
minimum
wage
should
be
to
by
my
figures
so
it
is
proposed
that
we
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
per
hour
by
july
and
then
give
a
cost
of
living
increase
every
july
and
anyone
who
doesnt
like
it
is
obviously
a
country
club
republican
getting
rich
off
the
exploitation
of
poor
people
