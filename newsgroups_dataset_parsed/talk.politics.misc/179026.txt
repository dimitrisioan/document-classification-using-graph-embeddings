william
a
bacon
says
the
word
some
sums
it
up
alot
of
scientist
have
concluded
that
without
a
doubt
global
climate
willis
occurring
and
should
be
dealt
with
by
source
without
a
doubt
some
warming
will
occur
however
there
is
mucho
disagreement
on
how
much
warming
will
occur
the
original
doomsdayers
were
claiming
to
degrees
farhenheit
lately
they
have
been
saying
degrees
newer
studies
hint
that
it
might
be
less
than
a
degree
of
course
then
theres
the
other
side
an
article
in
yesterdays
atlanta
journal
stated
that
there
are
many
scientists
who
have
misgivings
that
the
data
being
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
global
warming
is
occuring
is
faulty
the
point
that
the
article
made
is
that
all
long
term
temperature
dataa
collected
has
been
in
urban
areas
and
that
any
heat
rise
can
be
attributed
to
the
growth
and
urbanization
of
the
area
they
called
it
the
asphalt
temperature
trend
we
have
no
real
long
term
data
on
remote
areas
such
as
the
middle
of
the
amazon
rain
forest
or
the
top
of
mt
everest
or
the
gobi
desert
for
that
matter
an
accompanying
article
mentioned
that
a
group
of
scientists
at
nasa
had
developed
a
method
for
using
a
satellite
to
collect
temperature
data
globally
and
that
preliminary
results
showed
a
slight
downward
trend
attributed
to
the
mt
pinatubo
eruption
it
went
on
to
say
that
even
with
the
current
downward
trend
there
appeared
to
be
no
change
in
global
temperatures
using
trend
prediction
methods
for
at
least
the
next
years
i
can
quote
the
article
verbatim
