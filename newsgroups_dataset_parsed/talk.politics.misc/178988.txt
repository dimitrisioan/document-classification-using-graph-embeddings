SYSTEMREGULATIONS
FOR
THE
EUROPEAN

SINCE
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT
THE
PARLIAMENTARY
ASSEMBY
OF
THE
EUROPEAN
COMMUNITY
HAVE
BEEN
ELECTED
DIRECTLY
BY
THE
CITIZENS
OF
THE
MEMBER
STATES
BEFORE
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT
MEPS
WERE
JUST
MEMBERS
OF
NATIONAL
PARLIAMENTS
MNPS
ELECTED
BY
AND
FROM
AMONG
THEIR
PEERS
IN
THE
EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT
EVERY
MEMBER
STATE
HAS
A
FIXED
NUMBER
OF
SEATS
WHICH
INCREASES
LESS
THAN
PROPORTIONALLY
WITH
THE
POPULATION
ONCE
IN
FIVE
YEARS
A
GENERAL
EUROPEAN
ELECTION
IS
BEING
HELD
IN
WHICH
THE
CITIZENS
OF
ALL
MEMBER
STATES
CHOOSE
THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES
TO
THE
EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT
NEXT
ELECTIONS
ARE
DUE
IN
NOW
THE
VOTING
SYSTEM
FOR
THESE
EUROPEAN
ELECTIONS
STILL
DIFFERS
FROM
ONE
COUNTRY
TO
ANOTHER
ALTHOUGH
THE
EUROPEAN
TREATY
ENABLING
THE
DIRECT
ELECTION
OF
THE
MEPS
REQUIRES
A
UNIFORM
VOTING
SYSTEM
UP
TO
NOW
EVERY
COUNTRY
HAS
JUST
USED
ITS
OWN
SYSTEM
MORE
OR
LESS
THE
SAME
ONE
USED
FOR
NATIONAL
ELECTIONS
BRITISH
MEPS
ARE
ELECTED
IN
A
FIRSTPASTTHEPOST
SYSTEM
WITH
ONE
MEP
PER
DISTRICT
NEARLY
ALL
OTHER
STATES
HAVE
CHOSEN
A
SYSTEM
WITH
PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION
BUT
THEN
IN
SOME
COUNTRIES
FRANCE
ITALY
MEPS
ARE
ALLOWED
TO
BE
A
MNP
AS
WELL
WHILST
IN
OTHERS
THEY
ARE
NOT
BELGIUM
NETHERLANDS
THE
EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT
IS
NOW
WORKING
ON
A
UNIFORM
ELECTION
SYSTEM
FOR
ITS
OWN
MEMBERS
SO
THAT
EVERY
CANDIDATE
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
SAME
REGULATIONS
TO
COMPLY
WITH
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
MEMBER
STATE
SHE
WANTS
TO
BE
ELECTED
FOR
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
THINK
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
QUESTIONS
DO
YOU
THINK
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
HAVE
UNIFORM
REGULATIONS
OR
SHOULD
EVERY
MEMBER
STATE
CONTINUE
TO
USE
ITS
OWN
REGULATIONS
FOR
EUROPEAN
ELECTIONS
THAT
IS
DO
YOU
THINK
A
SYSTEM
OF
MAJORITY
VOTING
SHOULD
BE
IMPLEMENTED
WITH
ONE
OR
MORE
MEPS
PER
DISTRICT
OR
WOULD
YOU
PREFER
A
SYSTEM
WITH
PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION
FOR
THE
WHOLE
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
OR
PER
STATE
PER
REGION
PER
DISTRICT
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
EUROPEAN
COMMISSION
OR
JUST
ITS
PRESIDENT
SHOULD
BE
DIRECTLY
ELECTED
TOO
OR
SHOULD
IT
BE
APPOINTED
BY
THE
EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT
OR
BY
THE
JOINT
MEMBER
STATE
GOVERNMENTS
AS
IT
IS
NOW
THE
MAASTRICHT
TREATY
ALLOWS
SUBJECTS
OF
MEMBER
STATES
TO
STAND
FOR
ELECTION
IN
ANOTHER
MEMBER
STATE
THEY
ARE
RESIDING
IN
DO
YOU
THINK
YOU
WOULD
OR
COULD

FOR
A
FOREIGNER
IF
HISHER
IDEAS
APPEAL
TO
YOU
DO
YOU
THINK
MEPS
SHOULD
BE

BE
A
MEMBER
OF
A
NATIONAL
PARLIAMENT
OR
A
REGIONAL
PARLIAMENT
TOO
OR
A
MEMBER
OF
A

REGIONAL
GOVERNMENT
BODY
THE

BOTH
STRASBOURG

BRUSSELS
MEPS
THEMSELVES
ARE
FOR
A
COMPLETE
MOVE
