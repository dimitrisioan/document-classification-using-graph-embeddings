YOU
DONT
SPECIFY
THE
MEANS
THROUGH
WHICH
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
TO
BE
PREVENTED
FROM
BECOMING
THE
TOOL
OF
BUSINESS
INTERESTS
AS
A
LEFTWING
BIG
GOVERNMENT
CONVENTIONAL
LIBERAL
IM
JUST
AS
WILLING
AS
YOU
ARE
TO
VOTE
AGAINST
ANTICOMPETITIVE
REGULATIONS
THAT
FAVOR
AUTO
DEALERS
BUT
WHAT
I
HEAR
FROM
LIBERTARIANS
IS
A
DESIRE
TO
LIMIT
INCUMBENTS
TERMS
TO
WEAKEN
GOVERNMENT
BY
ELIMINATING
ITS
POWER
TO
ENFORCE
ANTITRUST
LAWS
AND
A
DESIRE
TO
ELIMINATE
LEGISLATORS
PAY
EACH
STRIKES
ME
AS
A
PARTICULARLY
INEFFECTIVE
WAY
TO
INSURE
THAT
AUTO
DEALERS
AND
OTHER
SPECIAL
INTERESTS
CANNOT
INFLUENCE
PUBLIC
POLICY
IN
FACT
THEY
SEEM
CLEARLY
DESIGNED
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THE
OPPOSITE
IF
GOVERNMENT
IS
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
USE
NONINITIATED
FORCE
TO
ACHIEVE
ITS
GOALS
THAN
NO
SPECIAL
INTEREST
CAN
INFLUENCE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
USE
NONINITIATED
FORCE
ON
THEIR
BEHALF
FINE
LIBERTARIANS
AND
ANARCHISTS
ARE
NOT
ALONE
IN
BEING
UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH
THE
USE
OF
STATE
SPONSORED
COERCION
THE
NOTION
THAT
COERCION
CAN
BE
VIRTUALLY
ELIMINATED
IN
A
SOCIETY
OR
MORE
PROPERLY
THAT
ONCE
IT
IS
ELIMINATED
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
STATE
IT
IS
NO
LONGER
WORTH
SERIOUS
CONSIDERATION
IS
A
VIEW
THAT
IS
PECULIAR
TO
LIBERTARIANS
AND
ANARCHISTS
FOR
EXAMPLE
DOES
NONINITIATED
FORCE
COERCION
INCLUDE
TAX
COLLECTION
DOES
IT
INCLUDE
THE
MINIMAL
LEVEL
OF
REGULATION
OF
COMMERCE
ENVISIONED
BY
ADAM
SMITH
SINCE
COERCION
CAN
BE
EXERCISED
BY
ACTORS
OTHER
THAN
THE
STATE
HOW
IS
THE
STATE
TO
DEAL
WITH
IT
EXCLUSIVELY
THROUGH
AFTER
THE
FACT
ARBITRATIONLEGAL
COMPULSION
THE
MEANS
TO
REACHING
SUCH
A
RESTRICTED
GOVERNMENT
IS
ANOTHER
TOPIC
WHICH
ILL
ADDRESS
BRIEFLY
IT
CERTAINLY
WONT
HAPPEN
UNTIL
LIBERTARIANISM
IS
THE
DOMINATE
PHILOSOPHY
WHAT
MEANS
DO
WE
HAVE
TO
MAKE
LIBERTARIANISM
THE
DOMINATE
PHILOSOPHY
STATISTS
RUN
THE
EDUCATION
MONOPOLY
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CREATIVE
THE
ADVOCATES
FOR
SELFGOVERNMENT
REPORTS
OF
THEIR
SEMINAR
PARTICIPANTS
EMBRACE
LIBERTARIANISM
THATS
THE
BEST
MEANS
IVE
SEEN
YET
WE
SHOULD
LOBBY
FOR
COMPULSORY
SEMINAR
ATTENDANCE
IN
JEST
WELL
I
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
THE
PICTURE
OF
LIBERTARIANS
AS
AMWAY
PARTICIPANTS
IS
SOMEWHAT
MORE
REASSURING
THAN
THE
IDEA
OF
THEM
TRYING
TO
GOVERN
A
COMPLEX
CONFLICTUAL
INDUSTRIAL
SOCIETY
ID
VENTURE
TO
POINT
OUT
HOWEVER
THAT
IF
LIBERTARIANS
COULDNT
CONVINCE
AT
LEAST
OF
A
GROUP
OF
SEMINAR
PARTICIPANTS
TO
EMBRACE
THEIR
PHILOSOPHY
THEIR
PROPAGANDA
SKILLS
NEED
TO
BE
HONED
FRANKLY
HOWEVER
IT
IS
NO
GREAT
TRICK
TO
CREATE
A
GOVERNMENT
FOR
A
SOCIETY
IN
WHICH
ALMOST
EVERYONE
IS
ASSUMED
TO
AGREE
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
A
PROPER
GOVERNMENT
POLICY
ONCE
THAT
IS
ASSUMED
ALL
SORTS
OF
ANNOYING
FORMALITIES
CAN
BE
DISPENSED
WITH
ELECTIONS
POLICE
ETC
AND
AS
MR
MARX
SAID
THE
STATE
WILL
JUST
WITHER
AWAY
ON
THE
WAY
THERE
HOWEVER
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
EXPLAIN
HOW
ELIMINATING
VIRTUALLY
ALL
POLICIES
THAT
RESTRAIN
PRIVATE
COERCION
IN
THE
CURRENT
SOCIETY
WILL
HELP
US
TO
LIVE
HAPPIER
LIVES
OR
IS
IT
LIKE
SOCIALISM
JUST
SOME
SHORTTERM
PAIN
THAT
WELL
HAVE
TO
BEAR
UNTIL
EVERYONE
HAS
HAD
THE
BENEFIT
