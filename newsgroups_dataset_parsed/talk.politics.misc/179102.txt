YES
WEVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
SURVIVORS
ARE
NOW
SAYING
THAT
WEVE
ALSO
SEEN
THE
VIDEOTAPE
WHICH
SHOWS
THAT
THE
FIRE
STARTED
IN
TWO
OR
THREE
DIFFERENT
PLACES
WHICH
WERENT
NEAR
THE
TANK
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
THE
TAPE
ON
CNN
WHICH
NETWORK
DID
YOU
SEE
IT
ON
I
SAW
THE
FILM
ON
CNN
AS
IT
HAPPEND
IT
WAS
CLEAR
FROM
THAT
TAPE
THAT
THE
FIRE
STARTED
IN
ONE
LOCATION
RIGHT
WHERE
THE
TANK
WAS
ATTACKING
AND
THEN
HAD
PULLED
BACK
NO
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
THE
CNN
PICTURES
SHOW
TWO
SITES
CLEARLY
AND
A
THIRD
IS
BARELY
DISTINGUISHED
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
TAPE
YOU
SHOULD
NOTE
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
TOWERS
AT
EITHER
END
OF
THE
BUILDING
A
BIG
ONE
AND
A
LITTLE
ONE
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
MERELY
A
LONG
SHOT
OF
THE
BIG
TOWER
WITH
THE
TANK
IN
FRONT
IS
IN
FACT
THE
LITTLE
TOWER
YOU
CAN
TELL
BEACUSE
THE
FLAG
IN
THE
FOREGROUND
SWITCHES
SIDES
FROM
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PICTURE
TO
THE
LEFT
THE
THIRD
SITE
IS
VISIBLE
AS
THE
FLAMES
CLEARLY
COME
FROM
A
POINT
OBSCURED
BY
THE
SMALL
TOWER
YOU
NEED
A
TAPE
AND
A
GOOD
SLOW
MOTION
VIDEO
TO
SEE
THIS
