MITCHELL

SENATOR
DOLE
THIS
MORNING
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
IS
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
MAKE
THE
POINT
THAT
HE
BELIEVES
THAT
OUR
INVESTMENT
PACKAGE
OUR
JOBS
PACKAGE
NEEDS

BE
PASSED
AS
QUICKLY
AS

WE
NEED
THIS
INVESTMENT
FOR

JOBS
FOR
IMMUNIZATION
FOR
HIGHWAY
CONSTRUCTION
FOR
THE
IMPORTANT
PROGRAMS
THAT
WILL
PUT
PEOPLE
BACK
TO
WORK
RIGHT
AWAY
THIS
SUMMER
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
CONTINUES
TO
BELIEVE
HIS
PROGRAM
SHOULD
BE
PASSED
Q
WILL
HE
COMPROMISE
THATS
THE
QUESTION
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
AS
YOU
KNOW
THE
DISCUSSIONS
ARE
GOING
ON
THIS
MORNING
IN
THE
SENATE
BETWEN
SENATOR
MITCHELL
AND
SENATOR
DOLE
LETS
SEE
WHAT
THEY
COME
UP
WITH
BUT
THE
PRESIDENT
BELIEVES
HIS
JOBS
PROGRAM
SHOULD
GO
FORWARD
Q
GEORGE
WOULD
THE
PRESIDENT
BE
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
BILLION
FOR
ONE
YEAR
WHICH
APPARENTLY
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
COMPROMISE
BEING
OFFERED
BY
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IS
BEING
OFFERED
BY
EITHER
SIDE
THE
SENATE
DISCUSSIONS
ARE
GOING
ON
RIGHT
NOW
LETS
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
TODAY
Q
WOULD
HE
GO
THAT
FAR
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
REPUBLICANS
HAVE
OFFERED
SO
FAR
WOULD
HE
GO
THAT
FAR
BILLION
PER
YEAR
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
THE
PRESIDENT
BELIEVES
THAT
HIS
PROGRAM
SHOULD
BE
PASSED
AT
THIS
TIME
CLEARLY
WERE
GOING
TO
BE
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
WHAT
THE
SENATORS
MIGHT
OR
MIGHT
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
BUT
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
GET
INTO
FIGURES
RIGHT
NOW
LETS
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
Q
ITS
REASONABLE
TO
ASSUME
ISNT
IT
FROM
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED
SO
FAR
THAT
A
COMPROMISE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
NECESSARY
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
A
VOTE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
THE
REPUBLICANS
SEEM
MORE
INTRESTED
IN
STOPPING
PROGRESS
ON
THE
PRESIDENTS
JOBS
BILL
THAN
IN
DOING
SOMETHING
TO
CREATE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
THE
REPUBLICANS
SEEM
MORE
INTERESTED
IN
STOPPING
PROGRESS
ON
THE
PRESIDENTS
JOBS
BILL
THAN
IN
DOING
SOMETHING
TO
CREATE
REAL
ACTION
REAL
JOBS
THIS
SUMMER
FOR
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
I
THINK
THERES
NO
QUESTION
ABOUT
THAT
THERES
BEEN
SOME
FRUSTRATION
OF
LEGISLATIVE
ACTIVITY
OVER
THE
LAST
FEW
DAYS
Q
SO
YOULL
NEED
TO
COMPROMISE
TO
GET
YOUR
PACKAGE
THROUGH
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
WITH
THE
CONVERSATIONS
BETWEEN
SENATOR
MITCHELL
AND
SENATOR
DOLE
THIS
MORNING
Q
PREPARED
TO
COMPROMISE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
THE
PRESIDENTS
PREPARED
TO
LISTEN
TO
WHAT
SENATOR
MITCHELL
HAS
TO
SAY
THIS
MORNING
AFTER
HIS
MEETING
WITH
SENATOR
DOLE
Q
DOES
HE
FEEL
THAT
HE
HAS
BEEN
DEFEATED
IN
HIS
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
NOT
IN
THE
LEAST
IN
FACT
HES
BEEN
VERY
SUCCESSFUL
SO
FAR
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
HIS
TERM
Q
HOW
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
HE
PASSED
HIS
BUDGET
IN
RECORD
TIME
IN
SIX
WEEKS
AND
ITS
A
BUDGET
WHICH
REDUCES
THE
DEFICIT
BY
BILLION
OVER
FIVE
YEARS
AND
ITS
A
BUDGET
WHICH
PROVIDES
FOR
IMPORTANT
INVESTMENTS
IN
OUR
FUTURE
RIGHT
NOW
WEVE
ALSO
HAD
STRONG
PASSAGE
OF
HIS
JOBS
PROGRAM
THROUGH
THE
HOUSE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
A
MINORITY
OF
REPUBLICANS
IN
THE
SENATE
CHOOSE
TO
PERPETUATE
GRIDLOCK
AND
HOLD
UP
ACTION
ON
THE
PRESIDENTS
JOBS
PROGRAM
IS
NOT
A
SIGN
THAT
HE
IS
NOT
SUCCEEDING
OVERALL
Q
HE
CANT
BEAT
THIS
CAN
HE
Q
THE
FACT
IS
THEY
CAN
DO
THAT
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
THE
REPUBLICANS
CAN
STOP
ACTION
THERES
NO
QUESTION
ABOUT
THAT
Q
WHAT
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
DO
ABOUT
IT
Q
GEORGE
WHAT
DO
YOU
KNOW
ABOUT
THESE
ALLEGED
NOTES
TAKEN
BY
BORIS
YELTSIN
DURING
ONE
OF
THE
MEETINGS
IN
WHICH
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
TOLD
BORIS
YELTSIN
NOT
TO
TRUST
THE
JAPANESE
THAT
WHEN
THEY
SAY
YES
THEY
MEAN
NO
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
THINK
THATS
A
COMPLETE
MISREADING
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
AT
THE
MEETING
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
CONVERSATION
WAS
THAT
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
WAS
ACTUALLY
REASSURING
PRESIDENT
YELTSIN
AT
THE
TIME
ABOUT
HIS
CONVERSATIONS
WITH
PRIME
MINISTER
MIYAZAWA
OVER
THE
KURIL
ISLANDS
AND
THE
PRIME
MINISTERS
BELIEF
THAT
JAPAN
WOULD
PLAY
A
CONSTRUCTIVE
ROLE
IN
THE
PROCESS
I
MEAN
THIS
WAS
A
CASUAL
COMMENT
ABOUT
JAPANESE
COURTESY
AND
ETIQUETTE
BUT
OVERALL
IT
WAS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
A
CONVERSATION
WHERE
HE
WAS
REASSURING
PRESIDENT
YELTSIN
THAT
HE
BELIEVED
THE
JAPANESE
WERE
SERIOUS
ABOUT
THEIR
COMMITMENT
TO
THE
PROCESS
Q
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
SAID
THAT
WHEN
THE
JAPANESE
SAY
YES
THEY
MEAN
NO
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
THATS
NOT
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
EXACT
WORDS
AND
THERE
WAS
A
MUCH
LONGER
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
HE
DID
SAY
SOMETHING
ALONG
THE
LINES
THAT
HE
BELIEVES
THAT
ON
THIS
ISSUE
PRIME
MINISTER
MIYAZAWA
INTENDS
TO
REALLY
GO
FORWARD
WITH
THE
PROCESS
Q
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
ANY
ATTEMPTS
TO
EXPLAIN
THIS
TO
THE
JAPANESE
BECAUSE
APPARENTLY
THE
JAPANESE
PRESS
HAS
PICKED
THIS
UP
AND
THERE
APPEARS
TO
BE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
IVE
SEEN
THE
REPORTS
IN
THE
JAPANESE
PRESS
AND
IT
ACTUALLY
DOES
PUT
THE
SITUATION
IN
CONTEXT
IT
DOES
TALK
ABOUT
THE
JAPANESE
UNDERSTANDING
THE
JAPANESE
POINTS
OF
VIEW
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
GOING
TO
BE
A
PROBLEM
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
SOME
DIPLOMATIC
CONTEXT
JUST
TO
CLEAR
THINGS
UP
BUT
IM
NOT
POSITIVE
Q
GEORGE
WAS
THE
SPECIFIC
COMMENT
THAT
WAS
MADE
SPECIFIC
TO
THE
KURIL
ISLAND
SITUATION
OR
WAS
IT
A
GENERAL
OBSERVATION
ON
JAPANESE
ETIQUETTE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
THE
DISCUSSION
WAS
ABOUT
Q
THE
SPECIFIC
COMMENT
IS
WHAT
IM
ASKING
ABOUT
THAT
HAS
ALLEGED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
TRANSLATED
FROM
THE
RUSSIAN
NOTES
WHEN
THE
JAPANESE
SAY
YES
THEY
MEAN
NO
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
IT
WAS
A
COMBINATION
I
MEAN
I
DONT
THINK
THATS
THE
WHOLE
SENTENCE
I
THINK
THAT
THE
SPECIFIC
COMMENT
WAS
A
BROAD
GENERAL
OBSERVATION
FOLLOWED
UP
BY
A
SPECIFIC
FINISH
TO
THE
SENTENCE
WHERE
HE
SAID
IN
THIS
CASE
HE
BELIEVES
THAT
PRIME
MINISTER
MIYAZAWA
MEANS
TO
KEEP
THE
COMMITMENT
Q
WAS
HE
SAYING
IT
FACETIOUSLY
FIRST
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
THINK
IT
WAS
JUST
A
CASUAL
OBSERVATION
Q
AND
THEN
YOU
SAY
DIPLOMATIC
CONTACTS
WERE
MADE
TO
CLEAR
IT
UP
HAS
THE
PRESIDENT
SENT
A
MESSAGE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
NO
I
DONT
THINK
THE
PRESIDENT
SPOKE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
SECRETARY
CHRISTOPHER
HAS
MADE
SOME
CALLS
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
EXACTLY
HOW
MANY
Q
WELL
THIS
OBVIOUSLY
IS
A
BIGGER
DEAL
THAN
YOURE
MAKING
IT
OUT
TO
BE
IF
CHRISTOPHER
HAS
HAD
TO
MAKE
SOME
CALLS
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
NO
NO
IT
WAS
JUST
THAT
WE
GOT
THE
REPORTS
IN
VANCOUVER
AND
THE
SECRETARY
WANTED
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
IT
WAS
UNDERSTOOD
AND
MAKE
SURE
THERE
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
REPORTS
IN
VANCOUVER
AND
THE
SECRETARY
WANTED
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
IT
WAS
UNDERSTOOD
AND
MAKE
SURE
THERE
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
MISUNDERSTANDING
AND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
ON
Q
WHAT
IS
OUR
POSITION
ABOUT
THE
JAPANESE
THAT
THEY
MAY
HAVE
TO
SAY
ONE
THING
BUT
ACTUALY
MEAN
ANOTHER
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
NO
THE
POSITION
ON
THE
JAPANESE
IS
AS
THE
PRESIDENT
STATED
TO
PRESIDENT
YELTSIN
THROUGHOUT
THE
TWO
DAYS
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
HAD
HAD
A
GOOD
CONVERSATION
WITH
PRIME
MINISTER
MIAZAWA
PRIOR
TO
THE
SUMMIT
HE
REITERATED
THE
US
POSITION
THE
LONGSTANDING
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
JAPANESE
POSITION
ON
THE
KURIL
ISLANDS
BUT
ALSO
REITERATED
PRIME
MINISTER
MIAZAWAS
COMMITMENT
TO
MOVE
FORWARD
ON
THE
PROCESS
AND
TO
PLAY
A
CONSTRUCTIVE
ROLE
AND
I
THINK
PRESIDENT
YELTSIN
WAS
VERY
GLAD
TO
HEAR
THAT
Q
AFTER
LISTENING
TO
SECRETARY
CHRISTOPHER
ON
IRAQ
FOR
THE
LAST
FEW
DAYS
IM
A
LITTLE
CONFUSED
WHAT
IS
THE
US
POLICY
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
SEE
SADDAM
HUSSEIN
OVERTURNED
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
ITS
THE
SAME
POLICY
THAT
SECRETARY
CHRISTOPHER
HAS
REITERATED
AND
ALL
OF
THE
US
OFFICIALS
HAVE
REITERATED
WE
EXPECT
FULL
AND
COMPLETE
AND
UNEQUIVOCAL
COMPLIANCE
WITH
ALL
UN
RESOLUTIONS
RIGHT
NOW
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
THAT
COMPLIANCE
Q
THROWING
IT
OUT
FURTHER
THAT
IF
IRAQ
COMPLIES
SADDAM
CANT
STAY
IN
OFFICE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
RIGHT
I
THINK
THAT
THATS
OUR
JUDGMENT
IS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
SADDAM
HUSSEIN
TO
COMPLY
WITH
THE
RESOLUTIONS
AND
STAY
IN
POWER
BUT
THE
IMPORTANT
POINT
IS
THAT
WE
EXPECT
COMPLIANCE
BY
IRAQ
WITH
ALL
UN
RESOLUTIONS
AND
WE
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
DEMAND
IT
Q
AND
ARE
YOU
CONCERNED
THE
IRAN
WILL
BECOME
THE
DOMINANT
POWER
IN
THE
AREA
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
SECRETARY
CHRISTOPHER
HAS
ALSO
SPOKEN
TO
IRAN
OVER
THE
LAST
SEVERAL
DAYS
AND
HE
SAYS
WE
ALSO
EXPECT
FULL
IRANIAN
COMPLIANCE
WITH
ALL
INTERNATIONAL
NORMS
AND
STOPPING
SUPPORT
OF
TERRORISM
Q
THATS
A
VERY
GLIB
STATEMENT
THAT
HE
WONT
STAY
IN
POWER
IF
HE
COMPLIES
WITH
UN
RESOLUTIONS
ON
WHAT
LOGIC
DO
YOU
BASE
THAT
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
RIGHT
NOW
SADDAM
HUSSEIN
IS
NOT
COMPLYING
WITH
THE
UN
RESOLUTIONS
AT
ALL
HE
IS
NOT
RESPECTING
THE
RIGHTS
OF
HIS
PEOPLE
AS
IS
REQUIRED
BY
THE
UN
RESOLUTION
HE
IS
NOT
FULLY
COMPLYING
WITH
ALL
THE
RESOLUTIONS
REGARDING
INSPECTIONS
HE
IS
NOT
FULLY
COMPLYING
WITH
ALL
THE
RESOLUTIONS
REGARDING
ARMAMENTS
Q
WELL
WHEN
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
IF
HE
DID
COMPLY
HE
WOULD
BE
OUT
OF
POWER
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
RIGHT
NOW
HIS
POWER
RESTS
ON
THE
REPRESSION
OF
HIS
PEOPLE
IF
HE
STOPPED
DOING
THAT
IT
WOULD
MAKE
IT
MORE
DIFFICULT
FOR
HIM
TO
STAY
IN
POWER
Q
GEORGE
BACK
ON
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
YOU
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
ACCUSE
THE
REPUBLICANS
OF
PLAYING
PURE
POLITICS
AND
PERPETUATING
GRIDLOCK
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
WHAT
EVIDENCE
DO
YOU
HAVE
THAT
THEY
JUST
DONT
HAVE
A
GENUINE
IDEALOGICAL
DIFFERENCE
WITH
YOU
THATS
IN
GOOD
FAITH
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
THE
FACT
THAT
SEVERAL
TIMES
IN
THE
PAST
THE
REPUBLICANS
MANY
OF
THE
ONES
WHO
ARE
NOW
LEADING
THE
FIGHT
FOR
THE
FILIBUSTER
HAVE
SUPPORTED
THE
VERY
FUNDING
THEY
NOW
SEEK
TO
STOP
MOST
ESPECIALLY
THE
HIGHWAY
FUNDING
Q
GEORGE
IN
REGARDS
TO
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
MODERATE
REPUBLICANS
SAID
THAT
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
ERRED
BY
NOT
BEING
MORE
OPEN
TO
THEM
DURING
THE
WHILE
THE
PLAN
WAS
PUT
TOGETHER
THAT
THEY
HAD
ONE
SORT
OF
PROFORMA
MEETING
BETWEEN
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
AND
THE
SENATE
REPUBLICANS
AND
THAT
WAS
IT
DOES
THE
ADMINISTRATION
LOOK
BACK
AND
THINKS
PERHAPS
IT
COULD
HAVE
DONE
A
BETTER
JOB
OF
WORKING
WITH
SOME
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
IM
NOT
SURE
THAT
ITS
TRUE
THAT
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
MEETING
I
MEAN
THE
PRESIDENT
MET
WITH
THE
REPUBLICAN
LEADERSHIP
ON
AT
LEAST
TWO
OCCASIONS
BEFORE
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
HIS
PACKAGE
HE
MET
WITH
THE
ENTIRE
SENATE
REPUBLICAN
CAUCUS
ALSO
FOR
LUNCH
AND
WENT
UP
THERE
WE
ARE
CONTINUALLY
IN
CONTACT
WITH
AS
MANY
REPUBLICANS
AS
WE
CAN
FIND
WHO
HAVE
AN
INTEREST
IN
THE
PRESIDENTS
PACKAGE
WE
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
SAY
AS
WELL
BUT
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
PROGRAM
IS
IMPORTANT
AND
WERE
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
FIGHT
FOR
IT
Q
YOUR
ALL
OR
NOTHING
DO
IT
WITH
THE
DEMOCRATS
ALONE
STRATEGY
DID
YOU
MAYBE
MISCALCULATE
THE
ABILITY
TO
GET
IT
THROUGH
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
I
MEAN
I
THINK
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
UNDER
THE
SENATE
RULES
A
DETERMINED
MINORITY
CAN
FRUSTRATE
ACTIVITY
I
MEAN
THERE
IS
JUST
NO
QUESTION
ABOUT
THAT
YOU
ONLY
NEED
PLUS
ONE
TO
KEEP
GOING
PLUS
ONE
TO
KEEP
GOING
AND
TO
STOP
ANY
ACTION
AND
THATS
WHAT
THE
REPUBLICANS
ARE
DOING
Q
GOING
TO
RETHINK
THE
WAY
YOU
ATTEMPT
TO
GET
OTHER
THINGS
PASSED
AS
YOU
GO
THROUGH
THIS
PROCESS
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
SUMMER
Q
WORK
WITH
REPUBLICANS
AND
TRY
TO
WOO
SOME
REPUBLICANS
INTO
YOUR
CAMP
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
THINK
WERE
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
LOOK
FOR
THE
SUPPORT
OF
REPUBLICANS
WHENEVER
WE
CAN
GET
IT
ON
THE
PRESIDENTS
INTIATIVES
Q
BUT
ON
THIS
ONE
HOW
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
DO
IT
DIFFERENTLY
THAN
YOU
DID
IT
ON
THIS
ONE
BECAUSE
ON
THIS
ONE
YOU
REALLY
DID
STIFF
THE
REPUBLICANS
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
AND
MADE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
IT
WAS
A
DEMOCRATIC
MAJORITY
THAT
WOULD
GET
THIS
THROUGH
AND
COULD
GET
IT
THROUGH
AND
YOU
REALLY
DIDNT
NEED
REPUBLICAN
VOTES
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
TAKE
A
DIFFERENT
TACK
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
FOR
PARTICULAR
VOTES
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
THROUGH
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
CANT
SEE
INTO
THE
FUTURE
AND
UNDERSTAND
EVERY
POSSIBLE
TURN
IN
THE
LEGISLATIVE
ROAD
CLEARLY
THE
PRESIDENTS
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
REACH
OUT
WHEN
HE
CAN
Q
YOU
DONT
HAVE
ANY
REGRETS
THEN
ABOUT
THE
WAY
YOU
HAVE
HANDLED
IT
UP
TO
NOW
AND
YOU
DONT
PLAN
ANY
CHANGES
IN
YOUR
APPROACH
IN
DEALING
WITH
THE
REPUBLICANS
IN
CONGRESS
BASED
ON
THIS
EXPERIENCE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
OBVIOUSLY
THE
PRESIDENT
WOULD
LIKE
HIS
PACKAGE
PASSED
AS
QUICKLY
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
HES
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
PRESS
FOR
THAT
WE
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
REACH
OUT
TO
REPUBLICANS
THERES
NOT
QUESTION
ABOUT
THAT
AND
WELL
CONTINUE
TO
REASON
WITH
THEM
AND
TRY
AND
FIND
APPROPRIATE
AVENUES
FOR
COOPERATION
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
REPUBLICANS
HAVE
CHOSEN
TO
UNIFY
AROUND
A
FILIBUSTER
AROUND
A
PLAN
TO
FRUSTRATE
ACTION
NOT
A
PLAN
TO
MOVE
FORWARD
Q
THEYRE
BEING
DENIED
ANY
OTHER
LEGISLATIVE
MEANS
OF
PUTTING
THEIR
PROPOSALS
FORWARD
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
THINK
THEYRE
BEING
Q
ANY
IDEAS
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
THINK
THEIR
AMENDMENTS
ARE
BEING
DEFEATED
I
DONT
KNOW
THAT
THEYRE
BEING
DENIED
Q
TO
PRESENT
THEM
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
THATS
NOT
EXACTLY
TRUE
I
MEAN
THEY
GET
THE
VOTES
Q
THAT
THEIRS
CAN
BE
PASSED
THOUGH
BY
THE
PARLIAMENTARY
RULES
UNDER
WHICH
THEYRE
PLAYING
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
UNLESS
THEY
GET
A
MAJORITY
IN
SUPPORT
ALL
THE
WAY
AROUND
NO
THATS
NOT
EXACTLY
TRUE
Q
GEORGE
ONE
MORE
ON
IRAQ
IS
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BACKING
ANY
OF
THE
IRAQI
OPPOSITION
GROOMING
ANY
NEW
LEADERSHIP
Q
BACKING
ANY
OF
THE
IRAQI
LEADERSHIP
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
OH
I
AGAIN
WERE
PRESSING
FOR
IRAQI
COMPLIANCE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
WE
CAN
GET
INTO
THE
BUSINESS
OF
GROOMING
LEADERSHIP
I
BELIEVE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SOME
CONTACTS
AT
SOME
LEVELS
WITH
IRAQI
OPPOSITION
GROUPS
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
ANYTHING
RECENTLY
Q
JESSE
JACKSON
WHO
OF
COURSE
IS
NOT
THE
PRESIDENTS
BEST
FRIEND
HAS
HOWEVER
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THERE
IS
TO
BE
SOME
KIND
OF
TOWN
MEETING
OR
SOME
KIND
OF
INVOLVEMENT
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
PREEMPTED
THE
BALL
GAME
LOS
ANGELES
WILL
HE
CONSIDER
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
OR
ANY
OTHER
KIND
OF
INTERVENTION
THERE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
AS
YOU
KNOW
THE
PRESIDENT
APPOINTED
COMMERCE
SECRETARY
RON
BROWN
ABOUT
DAYS
AGO
TO
BE
A
SPECIAL
ENVOY
TO
CALIFORNIA
AND
COORDIANTE
CABINET
ACTIVITIES
AROUND
THE
CALIFORNIA
ECONOMIC
SITUATION
INCLUDING
THE
SITUATION
IN
LOS
ANGELES
I
BELIEVE
THERE
WILL
ALSO
BE
VISITS
OUT
TO
LOS
ANGELES
BY
THE
EDUCATION
OR
HAVE
BEEN
VISITS
BY
THE
EDUCATION
SECRETARY
MR
RILEY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
TRANSPORTATION
SECRETARY
PENA
AND
HUD
SECRETARY
CISNEROS
ARE
ALSO
GOING
OUT
AND
THERE
MAY
BE
OTHER
VISITS
BY
CABINET
OFFICIALS
OVER
THE
NEXT
SEVERAL
DAYS
AND
WEEKS
I
WOULDNT
RULE
OUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
VISIT
BY
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
TO
CALIFORNIA
OBVIOUSLY
HE
IS
FOLLOWING
THE
SITUATION
CLOSELY
AND
IS
CONCERNED
ABOUT
MAKING
SURE
THAT
WE
MAKE
THE
RIGHT
LONG
TERM
POLICY
DECISIONS
THAT
WILL
HELP
CREATE
THE
KIND
OF
ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITIES
WHICH
HELP
PREVENT
DISTURBANCES
BUT
WERE
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
WATCH
IT
Q
GEORGE
AS
A
FOLLOWUP
REVEREND
JACKSON
IS
ALSO
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
OUTSIDE
THE
BALL
PARK
TODAY
IN
BALTIMORE
WITH
A
GROUP
OF
SUPPORTERS
PROTESTING
THE
LACK
OF
MINORITIES
IN
BASEBALL
MANAGEMENT
DOES
THE
PRESIDENT
HAVE
A
POSITION
ON
THAT
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
RECEIVED
CORRESPONDENCE
FROM
REVEREND
JACKSON
I
KNOW
THAT
REVEREND
JACKSON
HAS
ALSO
SPOKEN
WITH
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
CHIEF
OF
STAFF
MACK
MCLARTY
HE
CLEARLY
RAISES
SERIOUS
QUESTIONS
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
PROGRESS
IN
BASEBALL
OVER
THE
LAST
SEVERAL
YEARS
BUT
STILL
NOT
ENOUGH
BUT
THE
PRESIDENT
INTENDS
TO
CONTINUE
TO
GO
TO
THE
BALL
GAME
Q
IS
HE
GOING
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
TODAY
OR
SEE
REVEREND
JACKSON
WHILE
HES
OUT
THERE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
HE
IS
GOING
TO
SEE
THEM
BUT
AS
I
SAID
THE
PRESIDENT
BELIEVES
THAT
REVEREND
JACKSON
HAS
RAISED
SOME
SERIOUS
QUESTIONS
AND
ITS
SOMETHING
THAT
AS
I
SAID
EVEN
THOUGH
THERE
HAS
BEEN
PROGRESS
ITS
CLEARLY
NOT
ENOUGH
Q
DID
REVEREND
JACKSON
ASK
HIM
NOT
TO
GO
TO
THE
BALL
GAME
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THAT
I
BELIEVE
THE
CHARACTERIZATION
THE
REVEREND
JACKSON
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
IS
AN
INFORMATIONAL
PICKETT
I
DONT
KNOW
THAT
HE
ASKED
HIM
NOT
TO
GO
TO
THE
BALL
GAME
BUT
HE
SENT
A
LONG
DETAILED
FORMAL
LETTER
OUTLINING
HIS
CONCERNS
WITH
THE
SITUATION
IN
MAJOR
LEAGUE
BASEBALL
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
READ
IT
Q
GEORGE
THE
ORIOLES
ARE
PLAYING
THE
RANGERS
THE
MANAGING
PARTNER
OF
THE
RANGERS
IS
GEORGE
W
BUSH
IS
HE
GOING
TO
BE
THERE
AND
IS
HE
GOING
TO
MEET
WITH
THE
PRESIDENT
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
DONT
KNOW
Q
WHAT
IS
THE
MUBARAK
SCHEDULE
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
KNOW
THAT
PRESIDENT
MUBARAK
IS
COMING
TOMORROW
MORNING
FOR
A
WORKING
MEETING
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
LUNCH
AND
I
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
IS
HAVING
DINNER
TONIGHT
WITH
VICE
PRESIDENT
GORE
Q
AND
JOINT
STATEMENTS
TOMORROW
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
BELIEVE
SO
YES
AT
THE
END
YES
Q
IS
THERE
EVIDENCE
GEORGE
THAT
THE
EGYPTIANS
DID
WARN
THE
US
ABOUT
A
POTENTIAL
TERRORIST
BOMBING
TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
AS
REPORTED
IN
THE
NEW
YORK
TIMES
I
MEAN
I
THINK
THAT
PRESIDENT
MUBARAK
DID
SAY
THAT
THERE
HAS
BEEN
GENERAL
CONVERSATIONS
WITH
THE
EGYPTIANS
AS
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
FOR
A
LONG
PERIOD
OF
TIME
WE
DO
HAVE
GENERAL
INTELLIGENCE
SHARING
I
MEAN
BUT
PRESIDENT
MUBARAK
WAS
VERY
CAREFUL
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
SPECIFIC
INFORMATION
ON
THIS
VISIT
THAT
WAS
PASSED
FORWARD
THE
PRESIDENT
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
SITUATION
BUT
HE
ALSO
REITERATES
HIS
BELIEF
THAT
WE
CANNOT
TOLERATE
TERRORISM
OF
ANY
KIND
Q
GEORGE
HE
DID
MAKE
SPECIFIC
OR
THE
EGYPTIANS
APPARENTLY
DID
ISSUE
SPECIFIC
WARNINGS
ABOUT
THIS
INDIVIDUAL
WHO
FORGIVE
ME
THIS
INDIVIDUAL
WHO
FORGIVE
ME
THE
NAME
ESCAPES
ME
AT
THE
MOMENT
AND
SAID
THE
EGYPTIANS
WERE
MORE
OR
LESS
REBUFFED
IN
THEIR
ATTEMPTS
TO
GET
SOME
KIND
OF
ACTION
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
AGAIN
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
I
WOULD
AGREE
WITH
YOUR
CHARACTERIZATION
OF
THE
MUBARAK
INTERVIEW
HE
DID
SAY
THAT
THEY
GAVE
GENERAL
WARNINGS
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
NETWORK
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
UPON
WHICH
WE
TOOK
APPROPRIATE
ACTION
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
SPECIFIC
INFORMATION
ON
THIS
SPECIFIC
OPERATION
AT
ALL
Q
SO
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
DOESNT
FEEL
THAT
ANY
OF
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
WHETHER
IT
BE
THE
CIA
OR
FBI
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
RECEIVED
THIS
KIND
OF
INFORMATION
WAS
LAX
OR
DERELICT
IN
ITS
DUTY
IN
NOT
PURSUING
SOME
KIND
OF
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
NO
NOT
AT
ALL
Q
WHATS
NEXT
WITH
SERBIA
IT
GOT
ONLY
A
PASSING
MENTION
IN
THE
NEWS
CONFERENCE
YESTERDAY
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
YOU
DIDNT
GET
TO
ASK
YOUR
QUESTION
Q
YES
EXACTLY
WAS
THERE
ANY
AGREEMENT
ON
CONCERTED
ACTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
COUNTRIES
AND
EVEN
IF
THERE
WASNT
WHAT
DOES
THE
US
DO
NEXT
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
I
THINK
THE
US
IS
CLEARLY
GOING
TO
MOVE
FORWARD
IN
THE
UN
TODAY
CONTINUING
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
OUR
ALLIES
ON
A
SANCTIONS
RESOLUTION
AND
WELL
CONTINUE
TO
LOOK
FOR
WAYS
TO
PRESS
THE
SERBIANS
TO
COME
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
AND
SIGN
AN
AGREEMENT
Q
GEORGE
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
SANCTIONS
IS
STILL
AN
OPTION
I
MEAN
THE
SERBIANS
MAKE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
AT
LEAST
THE
LEADERSHIP
IS
SURVIVING
JUST
FINE
AND
THEY
FEEL
LIKE
THEY
CAN
WAIT
YOU
OUT
AND
EVEN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS
WE
HAD
IN
THE
OTHER
DAY
SAID
THERES
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THEYRE
GOING
TO
HAVE
AN
EFFECT
ANY
TIME
SOON
THE
BOSNIAN
SERBS
HAVE
SAID
NO
TO
THE
PEACE
PLAN
WHEN
DOES
NO
MEAN
NO
AND
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
WELL
I
MEAN
WE
ARE
DOING
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
WERE
MOVING
FORWARD
ON
FURTHER
SANCTIONS
THROUGH
THE
UN
AND
THOSE
DISCUSSIONS
WILL
CONTINUE
WERE
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
TRY
AND
TIGHTEN
THE
NOOSE
ON
SERBIA
AND
I
THINK
THAT
EVERY
OPPORTUNITY
WE
HAVE
TO
DO
THAT
WILL
HAVE
AN
EFFECT
OVER
TIME
Q
ARE
WE
LOOKING
AGAIN
AT
LIFTING
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
SAID
THAT
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
Q
GEORGE
DO
YOU
HAVE
ANY
MORE
ON
HUGH
RODHAMS
CONDITION
HOW
HES
DOING
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
NOTHINGS
CHANGED
Q
GEORGE
WEEK
AFTER

A
LITTLE
UNCLEAR
I
THINK
WELL

EITHER
TONIGHT
OR
TOMORROW
MORNING
AFTER
THE
MUBARAK
VISIT
Q
IS
HE
GOING
SOMEWHERE
FOR
EASTER
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
NOT
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
Q
WHAT
MORE
CAN
YOU
TELL
US
ABOUT
THE
ADDITIONAL
AID
TO
RUSSIA
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
PLANS
TO
ASK
CONGRESS
ABOUT
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
HES
GOING
TO
BE
CONSULTING
WITH
THE
CONGRESS
AND
WITH
OUR
PARTNERS
OVER
THE
NEXT
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS

KNOW
THAT

LAST
EVENING
WITH
CONGRESSMAN
GEPHARDT
AND
THEIR
DELEGATION
BEFORE
THE
THE
CONGRESSIONAL
DELEGATION
MEETS
WITH
THE
RUSSIANS
THIS
WEEK
AND
THOSE
CONSULTATIONS
WILL
CONTINUE
OVER
THE
NEXT
SEVERAL
WEEKS
Q
DO
YOU
EXPECT
THAT
PACKAGE
TO
BE
OF
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
ONE
ANNOUNCED
SUNDAY
MR
STEPHANOPOULOS
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
DISCUSS

MAGNITUDE
Q
HOW

UP
I

THIS
LIST
MR

I
THINK
HES
GOING
TO
TALK
TO
THE
CONGRESSIONAL
LEADERS
ABOUT
COMPILING
THE
LIST
BUT
IM
CERTAIN
WELL
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
OUR
OWN
RESEARCHERS
WORKING
AS
WELL
Q
GEORGE

LIFTING
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
MORE
OF
A
PROBABILITY
