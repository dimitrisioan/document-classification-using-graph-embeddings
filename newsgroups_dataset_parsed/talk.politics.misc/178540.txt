AS

THREAD
LIMITING
GOVT
THE
PROBLEM
LIBERTARIANS
FACE
IS
INSURING
THAT
THE
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
THEY
SEEK
DOES
NOT
BECOME
THE
TOOL
OF
PRIVATE
INTERESTS
TO
PURSUE
THEIR
OWN
AGENDA
IT
IS
A
FAILURE
OF
LIBERTARIANISM
IF
THE
IDEOLOGY
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
ANY
REASONABLE
WAY
TO
RESTRAIN
SUCH
ACTIONS
OTHER
THAN
UTOPIAN
DREAMS
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
SAYING
THAT
A
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
WILL
PROVIDE
MORE
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
PRIVATE
INTERESTS
TO
USE
IT
TO
PURSUE
THEIR
OWN
AGENDAS
AND
ASKING
LIBERTARIANS
TO
PROVE
THAT
THIS
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
WHILE
I
CANT
OFFER
SUCH
A
PROOF
IT
SEEMS
PRETTY
DAMN
PLAUSIBLE
THAT
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
DOES
NOT
REGULATE
A
PARTICULAR
AREA
IT
CANNOT
BECOME
A
TOOL
OF
PRIVATE
INTERESTS
TO
PURSUE
THEIR
OWN
AGENDAS
IN
THAT
AREA
I
RATHER
SUSPECT
THAT
ITS
THE
SORT
OF
GOVERNMENT
WE
HAVE
NOW
THAT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BECOME
SUCH
A
TOOL
AND
THAT
IT
IS
SUCH
A
TOOL
IN
MANY
INSTANCES
JUST
AS
MARXISM
FAILS
TO
SPECIFY
HOW
PURE
COMMUNISM
IS
TO
BE
ACHIEVED
AND
THE
STATE
IS
TO
WITHER
AWAY
LIBERTARIANS
FREQUENTLY
FAIL
TO
SHOW
HOW
WEAKENING
THE
POWER
OF
THE
STATE
WILL
RESULT
IN
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
AS
YOU
DEFINE
IT
IS
NOT
THE
PRIMARY
GOAL
OF
LIBERTARIANISM
AND
WOULD
NOT
BE
THE
PRIMARY
GOAL
OF
A
LIBERTARIAN
GOVERNMENT
MY
IMPRESSION
OF
LIBERTARIANISM
IS
THAT
ITS
PRIMARY
GOAL
IS
THE
ELIMINATION
OF
GOVERNMENT
COERCION
EXCEPT
IN
A
VERY
LIMITED
