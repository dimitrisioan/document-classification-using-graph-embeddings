who

conservative

this

kevin
darcy
writes
congress
is
not
allowed
to
abrogate
the
constitutional
rights
and
privileges
already
enjoyed
by
persons
however
unless
the
abrogation
has
a
rational
reason
or
a
compelling
interest
to
it
depending
on
which
standard
is
applied
this
is
relevant
because
granting
a
right
to
one
class
of
persons
by
definition
always
impinges
on
the
rights
of
another
class
or
classes
or
persons
to
some
degree
in
the
case
of
abortion
establishing
rights
for
the
unborn
impinges
greatly
on
the
rights
of
pregnant
women
there
has
yet
to
be
presented
a
sufficient
justification
for
such
fetal
rights
not
to
your
satisfaction
but
the
arguments
have
convinced
me
and
others
mob
rule
isnt
any
prettier
merely
because
the
mob
calls
itself
a
government
it
aint
charity
if
you
are
using
someone
elses
money
wilsons
theory
of
relativity
if
you
go
back
far
enough
were
all
related
