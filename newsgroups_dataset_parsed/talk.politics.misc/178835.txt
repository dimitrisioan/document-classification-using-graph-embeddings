will
italy
be
the
next
domino
to
fall
note
crossposted

and

this
is
a
reply
to
an
article
by
ed
ipser
which
also
appeared
in
altpoliticsusamisc
and
altpoliticslibertarian
but
no
longer
belongs
i
hate
to
defend
ed
the
article
was
very
poorly
written
but
here
goes
hallamdscomsadesyde
phill
hallambaker
writes
ed
should
take
a
look
at
the
budget
deficit
regan
and
bush
created
together
before
he
starts
to
make
claims
about
europe
collapsing
based
on
the
budget
deficits
here
none
of
them
are
serious
on
the
usa
scale
italys
percapita
debt
is
much
higher
than
usas
we
do
not
want
our
countries
to
be
run
by
a
narrow
elite
of
rich
lawyers
for
the
benefit
of
the
super
wealthy
this
is
exactly
what
the
public
in
france
italy
perceive
to
be
the
problem
thus
the
french
election
and
italian
pulizia
regarding
the
postpulizia
italy
what
looks
likely
to
happen
is
the
fringe
parties
are
going
to
do
much
better
in
the
next
election
most
of
the
parliamentary
deputies
are
going
to
get
replaced
and
the
parties
are
going
to
be
forced
to
look
to
people
who
are
free
of
any
hint
of
corruption
look
out
for
a
parliament
of
pavarottis
and
porn
stars
wrong
this
is
true
perhaps
only
for
the
lega
nord
the
referendum
sunday
is
expected
to
establish
a
britishamerican
style
firstpastthepost
system
in
the
senate
if
implemented
it
would
encourage
a
two
or
perhaps
three
party
system
in
italy
most
likely
the
dc
and
psi
will
not
be
these
parties
rather
there
will
be
a
shakeup
of
the
entire
party
structure
from
which
new
parties
will
emerge
to
dominate
will
lega
nord
be
one
of
these
who
knows
the
camera
dei
deputati
lower
house
will
likely
remain
with
proportional
representation
for
a
while
but
there
is
talk
of
switching
a
portion
of
that
house
too
maybe
as
much
as
firstpastthepost
overall
the
electoral
reform
in
italy
is
a
welcome
change
italians
are
tired
of
having
crappy
government
porn
stars
pavarottis
and
hunters
fishers
wont
gain
seats
because
pr
is
dead
a
good
twoparty
system
will
bring
italy
efficient
accountable
government
its
about
time
