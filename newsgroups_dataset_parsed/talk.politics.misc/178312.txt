professors
get
summers
off
industry
employees
dont
what
professor
gets
the
summer
off
the
primary
purpose
of
a
professor
at
a
university
is
to
publish
teaching
is
secondary
the
summer
is
when
professors
are
able
to
do
the
research
required
for
their
papers
im
told
by
my
advisor
that
only
at
some
universities
is
publishing
the
primary
emphasis
many
professors
in
the
cal
state
university
system
dont
publish
at
all
those
that
prefer
teaching
are
under
no
pressure
to
publish
when
discussing
and
issue
it
helps
that
all
participants
use
the
same
definitions
although
this
rarely
occurs
on
usenet
when
i
use
the
term
university
i
think
of
an
organization
that
has
a
bachelors
masters
and
phd
program
i
believe
that
cal
state
schools
do
not
i
call
them
colleges
uc
schools
are
universities
at
a
univeristy
the
number
one
goal
is
to
publish
cal
state
university
system
offers
bachlors
and
masters
degrees
the
phd
is
not
offered
because
of
opposition
from
uc
at
the
cal
state
schools
do
the
professors
you
speak
of
have
phds
at
nearly
all
the
professors
have
phds
i
havent
had
a
professor
who
didnt
though
my
wife
has
had
a
couple
of
professors
with
just
an
ma
a
friend
had
an
instructor
who
didnt
have
a
degree
at
all
but
because
he
had
been
minister
of
culture
for
the
black
panthers
he
was
teaching
anyway
he
had
a
bad
habit
of
usually
not
showing
up
to
teach
the
class
and
finally
quit
in
disgust
at
the
racism
of
a
university
that
expected
him
to
show
up
to
teach
a
university
you
have
professors
with
phds
and
then
teaching
assistants
tas
tas
were
the
slave
labor
graduate
students
who
got
their
tuition
paid
and
a
few
hundred
a
month
for
living
expenses
in
exchange
for
doing
all
the
grunt
work
the
professors
taught
the
lectures
with
to
students
per
class
then
the
tas
taught
the
labs
with
to
per
class
tim

at
sonoma
state
university
typical
class
size
is
to
per
class
teaching
is
definitely
more
the
goal
and
sometimes
it
actually
happens
the
best
professors
at
sonoma
state
u
are
equivalent
to
the
best
professors
i
