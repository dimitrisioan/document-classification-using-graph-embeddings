i
believe
the
mow
plans
and
handing
out
some
sort
of
wristband
thingy
and
basing
their
count
on
those
i
see
two
problems
with
this
one
can
they
get
everybody
to
take
one
and
only
one
two
they
couldnt
possibly
have
been
able
to
choose
a
colordesign
that
wont
clash
with
somebodys
outfit
and
three
the
ads
ive
seen
for
the
wristbands
indicate
theyre
charging
a
wristband
as
ive
seen
them
the
wristbands
look
like
clear
plastic
with
multicoloured
rainbow
threads
in
them
labeled
march
on
washington
the
being
your
particular
wristband
number
certainly
not
everyone
at
the
march
on
washington
will
be
willing
to
shell
out
five
bucks
for
a
piece
of
plastic
i
bought
mine
at
the
mow
storefront
its
not
plastic
its
woven
material
but
i
think
you
miss
the
point
its
not
about
the
five
bucks
in
your
pocket
its
about
supporting
the
march
and
helping
to
pay
for
all
the
printed
materail
and
scehdulkes
and
organisation
and
all
leading
up
to
the
literal
birth
of
queer
visibility
in
this
country
up
to
this
point
all
our
news
coverage
has
been
driven
by
events
thatb
happen
to
us
this
event
is
happening
by
our
direct
action
of
course
the
last
mow
was
the
same
thing
but
they
ignored
us
i
guess
that
was
just
labor
pains
perhaps
they
will
ignore
us
again
in
which
case
we
will
come
in
even
largeer
numbers
next
time
lst
night
in
dc
there
were
so
many
queers
out
and
about
you
could
hardly
get
in
any
place
i
suspect
thatb
over
the
next
two
days
that
will
become
exponentially
larger
to
my
mind
this
is
a
physical
bsuting
down
of
the
collective
closet
of
queer
invisibility
the
five
bucks
is
insignificant

euphoria
a
state
of
well
being
euphoria
is
my
natural
state
i
do
what
i
enjoy
and
an
abundance
of
all
good
fortune
comes
to
me
for
it
