NC
VERDICT
TFARRELLLYNXDACNORTHEASTERNEDU
THOMAS
FARRELL
WRITES
SO
YOU
FEEL
THAT
THE
DEFENDENTS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONVICTED
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
NOW
THAT
WOULD
TRUELY
BE
A
SAD
DAY
FOR
CIVIL
RIGHTS
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
EVERYBODY
ELSE
BUT
TO
ME
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONVICTED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
WHICH
IN
MY
MIND
WAS
QUITE
SUFFICIENT
SO
YOU
SAT
IN
THE
COURT
ROOM
AND
LISTENED
TO
THE
CASE
AFTER
CAREFUL
CONSIDERATION
YOU
HAVE
COME
TO
YOUR
CONCLUSION
WELL
GOOD
FOR
YOU
