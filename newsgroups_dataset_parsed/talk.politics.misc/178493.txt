WRITES
BUT
PUNISHING
THE
PERSON
FOR
POSTING
SUCH
A
THING
SMACKS
OF
AUTHORITARIANISM
ITS
A
DELIBERATE
ACT
OF
FRAUD
INTENDED
TO
CAUSE
HARM
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
UNCLEAR
ABOUT
THE
LEGAL
MEANING
OF
FRAUD
MERE
MISREPRESENTATION
IS
NOT
FRAUD
YOUR
COMMENT
HERE
IS
MEANT
AS
A
PUT
DOWN
IT
FAILS
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
YOU
HAVE
EDITED
OUT
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
ACTION
UNDER
DISCUSSION
I
NEVER
BROUGHT
THE
LEGAL
DEFINITION
UP
I
USE
THE
ENGLISH
LANGUAGE
AND
NOT
THE
LEGAL
DIALECT
THE
LEGAL
DEFINITION
OF
FRAUD
CHANGES
FROM
ONE
COUNTRY
TO
ANOTHER
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
DISCUSSION
IS
MORALITY
OF
CENSORSHIP
HOW
DOES
A
POSTING
FROM
YOUR
SITE
DO
ANY
SUCH
THING
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOUR
SITE
IS
A
UNIVERSITY
DO
YOU
KNOW
ANY
PERSON
WHO
BELIEVES
THAT
A
UNIVERSITY
ENDORSES
EVERY
COMMENT
MADE
FROM
A
UNIVERSITY
SITE
THAT
IS
WHY
I
REFERED
SPECIFICALLY
TO
A
COMPANY
GOOD
NOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
ANY
PERSON
WHO
BELIEVES
THAT
A
COMPANY
ENDORSES
EVERY
COMMENT
MADE
FROM
A
UNIVERSITY
SITE
YOU
ARE
EXTRAPOLATING
FROM
THE
STATEMENT
I
MADE
CONCERNING
A
CIRCUMSTANCE
IN
WHICH
SUCH
AN
ACT
OF
CENSORSHIP
WOULD
BE
PERMISSABLE
TO
THE
TEEL
CASE
IF
YOU
HAD
BOTHERED
TO
READ
THE
POST
INSTEAD
OF
TRYING
TO
PROVE
HOW
STUPID
YOU
THOUGHT
ME
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
RATHER
BETTER
THE
MODE
OF
ARGUMENT
I
WAS
USING
WAS
A
FORM
OF
RHETORIC
ARGUMENT
BY
EXAMPLE
I
DESCRIBE
A
WIDE
SET
OF
CIRCUMSTANCES
IN
WHICH
AN
ACTION
IS
PERMISABLE
AND
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
THEY
DO
NOT
APPLY
THUS
THE
ACTION
IS
NOT
PERMISABLE
OBVIOUSLY
A
COMPANY
POSTING
FROM
A
UNIVERSITY
ADRESS
WOULD
BE
SQUASHED
IT
WOULD
BE
CONTRARY

I
SUGGEST
STRONGLY
THAT
IF
YOU
MEAN
FOR
THIS
TO
BE
TAKEN
AS
LETTERHEAD
YOU
GET
A
BETTER
STATIONERY
DESIGNER
NOW
YOU
ARE
CLUTCHING
AT
STRAWS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
DISCUSSION
IT
WAS
THE
FACT
OF
ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN
THE
COMPANY
AND
THE
POST
THAT
WAS
IMPORTANT
THE
TYPEFACE
ETC
IS
INCONSEQUENTIAL
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
NET
WHO
ARE
OPENLY
SUPPORTING
THE
MURDER
OF
MEMBERS
OF
MY
FAMILY
SIGH
IF
YOU
ARE
IMPLYING
THAT
I
AM
LYING
I
SUGGEST
YOU
READ
MARK
HOLOHAN
AND
ULICK
STAFFORDS
POSTS
INTO
SOCCULTUREBRITISH
IF
YOU
ARE
SUGGESTING
THAT
ADVOCATING
MURDER
IS
A
TRIVIAL
MATTER
I
WOULD
PREFER
THAT
YOU
STATE
IT
DIRECTLY
CERTAINLY
I
OPPOSE
THE
RIGHT
OF
DR
SIDIQUI
AND
THE
AYATOLAH
KHOMENHI
TO
CALL
FOR
THE
MURDER
OF
SALMAN
RUSHDIE
INCITEMENT
TO
MURDER
IS
NOT
PART
OF
WHAT
I
CONSIDER
LEGITIMATE
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
AS
FOR
YOUR
NOTION
THAT
EMPLOYEES
CAN
ARGUE
THEIR
DIFFERENT
POLITICAL
VIEWS
AT
THEIR
OWN
EXPENSE
COULD
YOU
EXPLAIN
PRECISELY
WHAT
EXPENSE
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
INTERNET
IS
NOT
FREE
THE
CONNECTION
CHARGES
ARE
QUITE
EXPENSIVE
FOR
COMERCIAL
CONCERNS
COULD
YOU
GIVE
ME
A
COST
BREAKDOWN
FOR
THE
EXPENSE
TO
YOUR
COMPANY
ATTRIBUTABLE
TO
AN
EMPLOYEES
POSTING
A
POLITICAL
VIEW
IN
DISAGREEMENT
WITH
YOURS
NUMBERS
PLEASE
THAT
IS
IRRELEVANT
THE
CASE
IS
NOT
THE
INCREMENTAL
COST
BUT
THE
FACILITY
COST
IF
I
DECIDE
THAT
A
COMPANY
I
AM
ASSOCIATED
WITH
SHOULD
SUBSCRIBE
TO
USENET
THAT
USENET
CONNECTION
IS
THE
PROPERTY
OF
THE
COMPANY
IT
IS
QUITE
LEGITIMATE
FOR
A
COMPANY
TO
HAVE
A
POLITICAL
OR
OTHER
AGENDA
AND
REGULATE
THE
USE
OF
ITS
PROPERTY
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
ITS
POLICY
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
A
MICROSOFT
EMPLOYEE
WERE
TO
POST
WINDOWS
NT
IS
CRAP
DONT
BUY
IT
FROM
A
MICROSOFT
MACHINE
I
WOULD
CONSIDER
IT
REASONABLE
FOR
MICROSOFT
TO
SACK
THAT
EMPLOYEE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
IF
A
COMPANY
DECIDES
THAT
IT
HAS
POLITICAL
OBJECTIVES
IT
MIGHT
WISH
TO
REGULATE
POSTINGS
IN
A
POLITICAL
MANNER
THIS
IS
NO
WORSE
THAN
RUPERT
MURDOCH
USING
HIS
PAPERS
AS
A
POLITICAL
PLATFORM
FOR
HIS
VIEWS
I
WAS
REFERING
TO
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
YOUR
POSITION
QUOTING
THE
WORDS
WRITTEN
BY
SLAVE
OWNERS
AT
ME
IN
THE
CAUSE
OF
FREEDOM
WHICH
WORDS
WRITTEN
BY
SLAVE
OWNERS
DID
I
QUOTE
I
DONT
RECALL
QUOTING
ANYONE
AH
YES
YOU
DID
NOT
QUOTE
THEM
MERELY
REFERED
TO
THEM
YOUR
CONSTITUTION
IS
NOT
CONSIDERED
SACROSANCT
IN
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
GLOBE
NOR
HAVE
I
ASSUMED
IT
IS
I
DONT
CONSIDER
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
TO
HAVE
TALISMANIC
VALUE
YOU
MIGHT
JUST
AS
WELL
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
ARGUE
FROM
THE
KING
JAMES
BIBLE
TO
A
MUSLIM
I
WAS
POINTING
OUT
THAT
YOUR
REASONING
IS
PAROCHIAL
WHEN
WITH
LITTLE
EFFORT
YOU
COULD
HAVE
MADE
A
SUBSTANTIVE
POINT
I
MADE
THE
EFFORT
APPARENTLY
YOU
MADE
A
CERTAIN
EFFORT
TO
MISUNDERSTAND
ME
YOUR
ARTICLE
CONSISTED
OF
A
REFERENCE
TO
THE
FIRST
AMMENDMENT
YOUR
SIGNATURE
AND
PRETTY
WELL
DAMN
ALL
ELSE
FOR
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
UK
PUBLICATION
THAT
UNDERSTANDS
THIS
TRY
INDEX
ON
CENSORSHIP
I
USED
TO
SUBSCRIBE
I
WOULD
STILL
IF
I
WAS
NOT
MOVING
INDEX
REGULARLY
PUBLISHES
OPINIONS
BY
NONAMERICANS
WHO
BELIEVE
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
REPRESENTS
APPROPRIATE
FREESPEECH
PRINCIPLES
FOR
ALL
OPEN
SOCIETIES
SEE
EG
THE
OPINIONS
OF
THE
DISSENTING
LAW
LORDS
IN
THE
SPYCATCHER
CASE
ARE
YOU
REFERING
TO
THE
INITIAL
HEARINGS
ON
AN
INJUNCTION
OR
THE
JUDGMENTS
ON
THE
SUBSTANTIVE
CASE
THE
INITIAL
HEARINGS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WON
WERE
JUDGED
ON
THE
NOT
UNRESONABLE
JUDGMENT
THAT
ASSERTION
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT
THE
NATIONAL
INTEREST
MIGHT
BE
HARMED
WOULD
BE
GROUNDS
FOR
PRIOR
RESTRAINT
THE
SECOND
SET
OF
HEARINGS
ON
THE
SUBSTANCE
JUDGED
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAD
NO
CASE
AND
THAT
THE
OFFICIAL
SECRETS
ACT
COULD
NOT
BE
USED
TO
SUPPRESS
INFORMATION
IN
THWE
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
ALREADY
THE
PART
THAT
THEY
WON
WAS
OVER
THE
COPYRIGHT
ISSUE
WHICH
IS
RATHER
SEPARATE
HERE
AGAIN
THE
ISSUE
OF
CENSORSHIP
IS
RATHER
DIFFERENT
IN
THE
CASE
THAT
INFORMATION
IS
DIVULGED
ON
THE
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
BE
COMMUNICATED
TO
THIRD
PARTIES
THE
FIRST
AMMENDMENT
CERTAINLY
DOES
NOT
APPLY
IN
THIS
CASE
AS
THE
NUMEROUS
PROSECUTIONS
OF
SPIES
IN
THE
US
PROVES
THE
CRUX
OF
THE
SPYCATCHER
AFFAIR
WAS
EXTRATERITORIALITY
OF
BRITISH
LAW
THE
CENSORSHIP
ASPECT
OF
IT
AROSE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
GOVERNMENTS
LUDICROUS
ATTEMPTS
TO
PREVENT
SUMMARY
OF
THE
CASE
IN
THE
BOOK
YOU
HAVENT
ANY
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ANYTHING
IVE
SAID
HAS
BEEN
REACHED
UNQUESTIONINGLY
ONLY
MOST
OF
WHAT
YOU
WRITE
FOR
SOMEONE
WHO
PURPORTS
TO
BE
OPPOSED
TO
ARGUMENT
FROM
ASSERTION
YOU
CERTAINLY
GET
BY
ON
ASSERTIONS
A
LOT
FUNNY
I
SAW
THAT
AS
A
REJECTION
OF
AN
ASSERTION
THAT
YOU
HAD
MADE
OF
COURSE
IN
REJECTING
AN
ASSERTION
I
HAVE
TO
MAKE
A
CONTRARY
ASSERTION
SINCE
THIS
ASSERTION
IS
UNPROVABLE
I
LEFT
IT
AT
THAT
SO
FAR
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
YOU
DEMONSTRATE
A
COMMAND
OF
THE
CONTRARY
OPINION
TO
YOUR
OWN
YOU
ARE
ATTACKING
MY
ANTICENSORSHIP
VIEW
BECAUSE
I
DARE
TO
ACCEPT
THE
VALIDITY
OF
SOME
PROCENSORSHIP
ARGUMENTS
WHILE
REJECTING
THEIR
CONCLUSIONS
PLUS
I
AM
NOT
AN
ABSOLUTIST
I
HAVE
THIS
FUNNY
IDEA
THAT
THE
SOLUTION
TO
THIS
PROBLEM
WAS
NOT
DECIDED
IN
BY
A
GROUP
OF
WHITE
MALE
GENTRY
IN
SECRET
SESSION
AND
SUMARIZED
IN
A
SINGLE
LINE
FURTHERMORE
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THE
ISSUES
ARE
HALF
AS
SIMPLE
AS
YOU
IMPLY
YOU
MAY
THINK
THAT
I
AM
BEING
ANTIAMERICAN
IN
DISALLOWING
RECOURSE
TO
THE
FIRST
AMMENDMENT
ITS
JUST
THAT
THIS
ARGUMENT
HAS
NO
CURRENCY
IN
THE
PARTS
OF
THE
WORLD
WHERE
THERE
IS
STATE
CENSORSHIP
SUCH
AS
IRAN
KEWAIT
AND
ISRAEL
I
DONT
PRETEND
TO
HAVE
GEARED
MY
DISCOURSE
FOR
ALL
CONCEIVABLE
AUDIENCES
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
YOU
HAVE
GEERED
YOUR
DISCOURSE
TO
ANY
AUDIENCE
SAVE
THAT
OF
PROVING
THAT
YOU
ARE
THE
ONLY
PERSON
WEARING
A
WHITE
HAT
