WRITES
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
I
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
SOME
OF
THE
POLITICS
THAT
IS
GOING
ON
WITH
THE
TEXAS
BULLET
TRAIN
AND
WAS
APPALLED
AT
SOME
OF
THE
APPARENT
UNDERHANDED
TACTICS
TO
PUSH
THIS
THING
THROUGH
WITHOUT
ANY
PUBLIC
SAY
WHATSOEVER
SO
I
WROTE
UP
A
SHORT
EDITORIAL
THING
AND
POSTED
IT
HOPING
TO
GET
SOME
DISCUSSION
I
SUPPOSE
EDITORIALS
DONT
DO
IT
HERE
SO
NOW
I
AM
ASKING
FOR
THE
GENERAL
OPINION
OF
THE
NET
ABOUT
THE
PROPOSED
HIGH
SPEED
TRAIN
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
IT
IS
A
STUPID
IDEA
AND
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
PEOPLE
SOMEWHERE
WHO
ARE
GOING
TO
GET
VERY
RICH
FROM
THIS
DEAL
MY
OPINION
IS
THIS
IN
A
SOCIETY
WHOSE
ECONOMY
IS
PRIMARILY
BASED
ON
CAPITALISM
THE
ROLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
BE
TO
PROVIDE
THOSE
GOODS
AND
SERVICES
THAT
NEED
PROVIDING
FOR
THE
GENERAL
PUBLICS
GOOD
BUT
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
SUPPLY
THOSE
NECESSARY
GOODS
AND
SERVICES
ONLY
WHEN
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
A
PRIVATE
ENTERPRISE
OR
INDIVIDUAL
TO
MAKE
MONEY
FROM
PROVIDING
THEM
I
AGREE
WITH
SOME
OF
THE
OTHER
POSTS
THAT
THIS
TRAIN
PROBABLY
CAN
NOT
MAKE
MONEY
AND
WILL
RELY
HEAVILY
ON
STATE
TAX
DOLLARS
THE
QUESTION
I
THINK
THEN
BECOMES
DO
WE
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
NEED
THE
TRAIN
I
CERTAINLY
DO
NOT
NOR
WILL
I
EVER
NEED
THIS
TRAIN
IN
LUBBOCK
TEXAS
WITH
THE
INEXPENSIVE
AIR
TRAVEL
PROVIDED
BETWEEN
DALLAS
AND
HOUSTON
I
DONT
THINK
PEOPLE
IN
DALLAS
OR
HOUSTON
NEED
IT
EITHER
