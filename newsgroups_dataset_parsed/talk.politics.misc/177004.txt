RE
TOP

REASONS
NOT
TO
AID
RUSSIANS
IN
ARTICLE
RCOLLINSENCORECOM
ROGER
COLLINS
WRITES
JULIEEDDIEJPLNASAGOV
JULIE
KANGAS
WRITES
I
SUGGEST
YOU
LISTEN
VERY
CAREFULLY
TO
THE
STUFF
YELTSIN
AND
HIS
PEOPLE
ARE
SAYING
AND
COMPARE
THAT
WITH
THE
VERY
ANTIWEST
SLOGANS
COMING
FROM
HIS
OPPONENTS
IN
THE
RUSSIAN
CONGRESS
I
SURE
KNOW
WHO
I
WANT
TO
BACK
COULD
WE
BACK
HIM
WITHOUT
FORCING
OTHERS
TO
BACK
HIM
AT
THE
POINT
OF
A
GUN
IF
WE
HAD
BACKED
HIM
STRONGLY
EARLY
ON
I
DOUBT
THERE
WOULD
BE
THE
PROBLEM
THERE
IS
NOW
MANY
RUSSIANS
BECAME
DISILLUSIONED
WITH
DEMOCRACY
AND
REFORMS
WHEN
THEY
FELT
RIGHTLY
IMO
THAT
THE
WEST
DIDNT
CARE
YELTSIN
WAS
VIRTUALLY
PROMISED
MASSIVE
AID
ONCE
BUSH
GOT
OVER
HIS
GORBYMANIA
THIS
PROBABLY
KEPT
HIM
FROM
DISMANTLING
THE
CONGRESS
AND
CALLING
FOR
NEW
ELECTIONS
WELL
THE
AID
DIDNT
COME
THROUGH
AND
WE
DIDNT
MAKE
SURE
IT
WENT
TO
THE
PROPER
PLACES
AND
NOW
THE
ANTIREFORMERS
ARE
GAINING
STRENGTH
WHERE
BEFORE
THEY
WERE
IN
HIDING
HAVE
YOU
CONSIDERED
A
NONINTERVENTIONIST
POLICY
IF
MARKET
REFORM
DOES
HAPPEN
RUSSIA
WILL
CERTAINLY
GET
PRIVATE
CAPITAL
AT
PRIVATE
RISK
TO
HELP
THEIR
ECONOMY
THEY
WILL
EVEN
HAVE
INCENTIVE
TO
DO
SO
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
IF
THEY
DONT
REFORM
THEN
OUR
GOVERNMENT
WILL
PROBABLY
CONSIDER
THEM
ENEMIES
ANYWAY
AND
RATHER
SPEND
MONEY
TO
HURT
RATHER
THAN
HELP
THEM
IF
THEY
DONT
REFORM
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
GIVING
THEM
MONEY
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THIS
IS
TOO
IMPORTANT
TO
TAKE
A
NONINTERVENTIONIST
APPROACH
THIS
IS
WHAT
REALLY
BUGS
ME
ABOUT
LIBERTARIANISM
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
ITLL
ALL
BE
THE
SAME
IN
A
HUNDRED
YEARS
TIME
NO
NEED
TO
DO
ANYTHING
HOW
DOES
THIS
AFFECT
US
WELL
WE
ARE
ON
THE
SAME
PLANET
AND
IF
VAST
TRACKS
OF
EUROPE
ARE
BLOWN
AWAY
I
THINK
WED
FEEL
SOMETHING
A
MASSIVE
BREAKUP
OF
A
COUNTRY
THAT
SPANS
THE
PLANET
IS
BOUND
TO
HAVE
AFFECTS
HERE
OF
COURSE
THERE
IS
ALSO
THE
HUMANITARIAN
ARGUMENT
THAT
DEMOCRACIES
SHOULD
HELP
OTHER
DEMOCRACIES
OR
STRUGGLING
DEMOCRACIES
IF
A
BILLION
GIFT
WAS
THAT
IMPORTANT
TO
OUR
WELL
BEING
COULDNT
IT
BE
RAISED
VOLUNTARILLY
PEOPLE
ALREADY
GIVE
OVER
BILLION
A
YEAR
TO
CHARITY
DESPITE
THE
WISHES
OF
LIBERTARIANS
THIS
SOCIETY
IS
A
FAR
WAY
AND
GETTING
FARTHER
FROM
BEING
LIBERTARIAN
PERHAPS
VOLUNTARY
GIFTS
WOULD
WORK
IF
WE
HAD
THE
PROPER
FRAMEWORK
BUT
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
IT
WE
HAVE
TO
FACE
THE
PROBLEM
NOW
NOT
IN
X
YEARS
WHEN
WE
HAVE
A
LIBERTARIAN
DREAM
SOCIETY
RIGHT
NOW
THERE
ARE
HUGE
STUMBLING
BLOCKS
TO
TRADE
LET
ALONE
CHARITY
THERE
ARE
STILL
LIMITATIONS
TO
HIGHTECH
EXPORTS
NASA
CANT
BUY
PROTON
LAUNCH
VEHICLES
FROM
THEM
SURE
THE
MARKET
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
HELP
A
GREAT
DEAL
BUT
IT
CANT
RIGHT
NOW
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
OBSTACLES
INSTEAD
OF
FIGHTING
AGAINST
THE
AID
YOU
SHOULD
BE
FIGHTING
TO
TEAR
DOWN
THE
OBSTACLES
THE
MARKET
AND
CHARITIES
HAVE
TO
FACE
SERIOUSLY
EVERYONE
HAS
DIFFERENT
OPINIONS
ON
WHAT
IS
STUPID
MY
TWO
CAUSES
ARE
AID
TO
RUSSIA
AND
A
STRONG
SPACE
PROGRAM
SOMEONE
ELSE
WILL
CHAMPION
WELFARE
OR
EDUCATION
OR
DOING
STUDIES
OF
DRUNKEN
GOLDFISH
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
HAVE
A
REPUBLIC
AND
NOT
A
TRUE
DEMOCRACY
INSTEAD
OF
GRIDLOCK
ON
A
MASSIVE
SCALE
WE
ONLY
HAVE
GRIDLOCK
ON
A
CONGRESSIONAL
SCALE
IT
SEEMS
INSTEAD
OF
GRIDLOCK
ON
ANY
SCALE
WE
HAVE
AID
TO
RUSSIA
EXPENSIVE
SPACE
PROGRAMS
NATIONAL
CHARITY
THAT
DOESNT
HELP
THE
POOR
AND
PROBABLY
STUDIES
OF
DRUNKEN
GOLDFISH
I
THINK
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
IS
MORE
KEY
THAN
HOW
DEMOCRATIC
IT
IS
WELL
I
THINK
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
IS
PRIMARILY
DEMOCRATIC
DUE
TO
IT
BEING
LIMITED
BUT
THE
MAIN
QUESTION
IS
HOW
DO
YOU
TRANSFORM
A
STATERUN
ECONOMY
AND
MONOLITHIC
GOVERNMENT
INTO
SOMETHING
THAT
EVEN
REMOTELY
LOOKS
LIKE
OURS
BTW
SOMETIMES
IT
SEEMS
THAT
OUR
GOVERNMENT
IS
TRYING
TO
GO
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
IT
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
PAINLESS
AND
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
EASY
WE
SIMPLY
CANNOT
WAIT
TO
HELP
WHEN
THEY
HAVE
THE
PROPER
GOVERNMENT
THEYLL
NEVER
GET
THERE
WITHOUT
THE
AID
IT
MAY
BE
TOO
LATE
ALREADY
BTW
WHO
IS
TO
DECIDE
STUPID
THIS
IS
JUST
LIKE
THOSE
WHO
WANT
TO
IMPOSE
THEIR
MORALS
ON
OTHERS
JUST
THE
SORT
OF
THING
I
THOUGHT
LIBERTARIANS
WERE
AGAINST
THAT
WAS
AN
OPINION
AND
LIBERTARIANS
ARE
VERY
BIG
ON
FREE
SPEECH
AND
IM
JUST
EXCERCISING
MINE
ACTUALLY
MY
POLITICS
ARE
PRETTY
LIBERTARIAN
EXCEPT
ON
THIS
ONE
ISSUE
AND
THIS
IS
WHY
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
ME
TO
JOIN
THE
PARTY
IT
SEEMS
THAT
LIBERTARIANS
WANT
TO
WITHDRAW
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
LET
IT
SINK
OR
SWIM
IF
YOU
ARE
PRETTY
LIBERTARIAN
EXCEPT
ON
THIS
ONE
ISSUE
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
BE
VERY
LIBERTARIAN
CONSIDER
IT
A
COMPROMISE
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
WOULD
YOUR
FELLOW
RUSSIAAIDERS
HAVE
TO
GIVE
TO
RUSSIA
IF
THOSE
YOU
OPPOSE
WERENT
USING
THE
SAME
GOVERNMENT
MACHINE
TO
STEAL
MONEY
FROM
YOU
AND
YOUR
GROUP
FOR
CAUSES
YOU
DONT
SUPPORT
AS
I
ALSO
SAID
ABOVE
ANOTHER
PROBLEM
I
HAVE
IS
WITH
TRANSFORMATION
A
LIBERTARIAN
SOCIETY
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
PAINLESSLY
OR
OVERNIGHT
I
HAVE
SEEN
NOTHING
ABOUT
HOW
TO
TAKE
OUR
CURRENT
GOVERNMENT
AND
SOCIETY
AND
TURN
IT
INTO
A
MINIMAL
GOVERNMENT
AND
A
RESPONSIBLE
SELFSUFFICIENT
POPULACE
WE
COULD
DO
THAT
YEARS
AGO
BUT
NOT
NOW
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
SAYING
THAT
FOR
HUNDREDS
OF
YEARS
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
YEARS
AGO
NOR
INSTANTANEOUS
COMMUNICATIONS
NOR
TRAVEL
TO
VIRTUALLY
ANYPLACE
ON
THE
EARTH
IN
LESS
THAN
A
DAY
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
WE
ARE
IN
THE
BEGINNINGS
OF
A
GLOBAL
ECONOMY
AND
GLOBAL
DECISION
MAKING
ALL
THE
MORE
REASON
TO
DEPEND
ON
THE
FREE
MARKET
WHICH
CAN
MORE
EFFICIENTLY
PROCESS
INFORMATION
THAN
TO
DEPEND
ON
RULERS
FOR
DECISIONS
ON
COMPLEX
ISSUES
YES
DEPEND
ON
THE
RULERS
OF
THE
FREE
MARKET
AND
THE
BUSINESSES
RULERS
DO
EMERGE
SOMEWHERE
AND
THEY
WILL
NEVER
REPRESENT
THE
OPINIONS
OF
EVERY
PERSON
ON
THE
PLANET
THERE
MUST
BE
CHECKS
AND
BALANCES
CHECKS
ON
THE
GOVERNMENT
WHEN
IT
GETS
OUT
OF
BOUNDS
AND
CHECKS
ON
INDUSTRY
WHEN
IT
GETS
OUT
OF
BOUNDS
PUTTING
ALL
YOUR
HOPES
ON
THE
BENEVOLENCE
OF
THE
MARKET
IS
TO
ME
JUST
LIKE
PUTTING
ALL
YOUR
HOPES
ON
THE
BENEVOLENCE
OF
GOVERNMENT
