dr
norman
these
were
not
your
typical
beer
swilling
rednecks
personally
i
wouldnt
have
paid
any
more
attention
to
the
incident
except
that
the
evening
news
when
describing
the
event
went
on
to
comment
that
being
booed
was
nothing
unusual
since
it
was
normal
for
audiences
to
boo
at
this
point
since
the
celebrity
was
delaying
the
start
of
the
game
what
a
bunch
of
crock
i
have
never
heard
of
any
incident
in
which
the
thrower
of
the
ceremonial
ball
has
been
booed
before
dan
quayle
got
roundly
booed
in
milwaulkee
last
year
i
was
listening
on
the
radio
this
was
the
game
that
quayle
told
the
brewers
players
that
he
would
like
to
see
them
play
the
orioles
in
the
alcs
its
come
to
this
has
it
defending
al
gore
by
comparing
him
to
dan
quayle
id
say
that
about
says
