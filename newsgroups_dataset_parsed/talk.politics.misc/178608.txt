when
you
force
people
to
associate
with
others
against
their
will
yes
good
grief
i
do
believe
that
for
once
you
may
have
an
argument
which
may
be
discussed
intelligently
i
guess
that
you
are
a
person
who
dislikes
contact
with
people
of
ethnic
minority
however
your
argument
again
falls
flat
on
its
face
you
state
that
you
under
an
antidiscrimination
bill
would
be
forced
to
associate
with
others
homosexuals
i
assume
against
your
will
how
do
you
know
that
you
do
not
associate
with
them
now
except
they
may
be
closeted
would
you
like
to
change
your
argument
to
read
forced
to
associate
with
truthfully
homosexual
people
against
my
will
you
have
no
proof
that
anyone
you
now
know
may
not
be
homosexual
and
this
punches
a
large
hole
in
your
argument
is
it
your
belief
that
a
homosexual
comes
in
only
one
flavour
sic
and
that
is
the
camp
mincing
type
prove
it
you
cannot
i
must
admit
though
that
it
looks
as
if
you
actually
thought
about
your
response
this
time
instead
of
just
raving
