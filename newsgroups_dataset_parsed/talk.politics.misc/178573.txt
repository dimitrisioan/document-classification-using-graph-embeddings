p
drug
use
is
on
the
rise
among
kids
as
young
as
eighth
graders
usually
and
theyre
using
more
lsd
and
inhalants
like
glue
and
air
fresheners
says
a
new
survey
the
annual
national
high
school
senior
survey
on
drug
abuse
finds
statistically
significant
increases
in
eighthgraders
use
of
many
drugs
including
marijuana
cocaine
crack
lsd
and
inhalants
we
may
be
in
danger
of
losing
some
hardwon
ground
in
reducing
drug
use
as
a
new
more
naive
generation
of
youngsters
enters
adolescence

at
its

point
since

reducing
drug

requires
a
different
kind
of
strategy
that
health
secretary
donna
shalala
says
will
be
part
of
an
overall
illness
prevention
plan
the
survey
shows
drugs
are
easier
to
get
and
fewer
eighthgraders
disapprove
of
them
its
scary
shalala
says
dealers
are
focusing
