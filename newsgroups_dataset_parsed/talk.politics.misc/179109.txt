CAN
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
WHY
WHEN
MR
CRAMER
SPOUTS
ON
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALS
HE
ONLY
ADDRESSES
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
AND
NEVER
IN
ANY
POST
IVE
READ
ADDRESSED
LESBIANS
I
CANT
REALLY
SPEAK
FOR
MR
CRAMER
HERE
BUT
I
CAN
SAY
THAT
A
HOMOSEXUAL
MALE
IS
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
ANIMAL
THAN
A
LESBIAN
THERE
IS
VIRTUALLY
NOTHING
THAT
IS
ANALOGOUS
OR
RELATED
BETWEEN
THE
ABERRANT
BEHAVIORS
PRACTICED
BY
THESE
TWO
GROUPS
OF
DEVIANTS
THE
LAST
TIME
I
CHECKED
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
AND
WOMEN
WERE
BOTH
HUMAN
I
THINK
MR
KALDIS
WAS
USING
THE
EXPRESSION
IN
THE
SLANG
SENSE
THOUGH
I
AGREE
IT
IS
NOT
AN
APPROPRIATE
EXPRESSION
TO
USE
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
THEY
BOTH
PREFER
TO
ENGAGE
IN
SEXUAL
ACTS
WITH
PEOPLE
OF
THE
SAME
GENDER
THERE
IS
NOTHING
INHERENTLY
WRONG
WITH
THE
TRADEMARK
BEHAVIOUR
OF
EITHER
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
OR
HOMOSEXUAL
WOMEN
EXCEPT
IN
THE
MINDS
OF
MISINFORMED
FOLK
CLUELESS
FOLK
AND
BIGOTS
SO
WHAT
MAKES
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
AND
HOMOSEXUAL
WOMEN
DIFFERENT
ANIMALS
MICHAEL
D
ADAMS
ENTERPRISE
ALABAMA
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
ARE
EXTREMELY
PROMISCUOUS
AND
HOMOSEXUAL
WOMEN
ARE
IF
ANY
MORE
PROMISCUOUS
THAN
HETEROSEXUAL
WOMEN
ITS
NOT
BY
MUCH
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
ARE
OVERREPRESENTED
AMONG
CHILD
MOLESTERS
ABOUT
OF
CHILD
MOLESTATION
IS
DONE
BY
HOMOSEXUAL
OR
BISEXUAL
MEN
WHILE
HOMOSEXUAL
WOMEN
DONT
APPEAR
TO
BE
SIMILARLY
OVER
REPRESENTED
