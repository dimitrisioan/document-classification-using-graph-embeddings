AND
ASSUALTED
TWO
OF
WHILE

HOW
IT
IS
NOW
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
JUSTIFIED
IN
ASSUALTING
THOSE

BECAUSE

FROM
THE
COMMENTS
OF

GROUPS
THAT
IN
A
LIBERAL
DEMOCRATIC
VISION
OF
AMERICA
ONLY
A
CERTAIN
SELECT
FEW
PEOPLE
CAN
EXPECT
TO
HAVE
CIVIL
RIGHTS
ENFORCED
AND
THIS
ADMINISTRATION
INTENDS
TO
ENFORCE
LAWS
APPLY
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
OBEY
THE
LAWS
ONLY
WHEN
IT
SUITS
THEM
TO
DO
