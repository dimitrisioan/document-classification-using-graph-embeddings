CHILDREN
IN

RICHARD
HOENES
WRITES
SUCH
A
HOSTAGE
SITUATION
HAS
TAKEN
PLACE
ON
NUMEROUS
OCCASIONS
WITH
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
POLICE
TRYING
TO
TAKE
THE
PLACE
BY
FORCE
AND
THE
RESULT
BEING
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
HOSTAGES
AND
THE
GUNMEN
HOWEVER
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
TIME
IVE
HEARD
OF
THE
BLAME
LANDING
SQUARELY
ON
THE
POLICE
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
WE
HAVE
A
POLICY
OF
NOT
NEGOTIATING
A
BACK
DOWN
FROM
TERRORISTS
AND
HOSTAGE
TAKERS
SINCE
THAT
ONLY
ENCOURAGES
OTHER
TERRORISTS
AND
HOSTAGE
TAKERS
NOT
AN
ACCURATE
ANALOGY
DAVID
KORESH
DID
NOT
TAKE
A
BUNCH
OF
HOSTAGES
AND
THEN
CALL
THE
BATF
WITH
A
RANSOM
NOTE
YOU
MAKE
IT
SOUND
AS
IF
THE
BATF
SHOWED
UP
TO
SAVE
THOSE
CHILDREN
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
I
HAVE
SOME
INTERESTING
NEWS
FOR
YOUBATF
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
JURISDICTION
IN
CHILD
ABUSE
CASES
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
BATF
SHOWED
UP
TOOK
THE
DAVIDIANS
HOSTAGE
THEN
THE
FBI
SHOWED
UP
NEGOTIATED
TO
HAVE
A
FEW
OF
THE
HOSTAGES
RELEASED
BUT
WERE
UNABLE
TO
KEEP
THE
BATF
FROM
KILLING
THE
REST
OF
THE
POOR
PEOPLE
TRAPPED
INSIDE
THE
COMPOUND

THE
STRONGEST
REASON
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
TO
RETAIN
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
IS
AS
A
LAST
RESORT
TO
