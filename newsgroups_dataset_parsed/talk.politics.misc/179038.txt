RE
EMPLOYMENT
WAS
RE
WHY
NOT
CONCENTRATE
ON
CHILD
MOLESTERS
IN
ARTICLE
TREE
OF
SCHNOPIA
WRITES
WOW
I
HADNT
REALIZED
HOW
VENOMOUS
THIS
WAS
GETTING
BE
CAREFUL
HERETHE
PROBLEM
ISNT
THE
RICH
BUT
THE
VALUES
AND
THE
SYSTEMS
THAT
MAKE
THE
RICH
RICH
BUT
THE
VALUES
AND
SYSTEMS
THAT
MAKE
THE
RICH
RICH
ALL
BASICALLY
AMOUNT
TO
FREEDOM
OF
CHOICE
IN
NEW
ENGLAND
IN
THE
ENTIRE
ECONOMY
WAS
BASED
ON
THE
SMALL
FAMILY
FARM
FARM
ECONOMY
HOUSEHOLDS
WERE
ECONOMICALLY
DIVERSIFIED
PRODUCING
NOT
ONLY
AGRICULTURAL
GOODS
BUT
ALSO
MANUFACTURED
GOODS
ESPECIALLY
CLOTH
MANY
FARM
WOMEN
CARDED
SPUN
ANDOR
WOVE
PRODUCING
NOT
ONLY
CLOTH
FOR
THEIR
OWN
FAMILY
BUT
ALSO
TO
SELL
GENERATING
EXTRA
INCOME
BUT
ABOUT
THIS
TIME
THE
INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION
WAS
UNDERWAY
IN
ENGLAND
AND
BY
THE
IT
HAD
MOVED
TO
THE
US
IN
BOTH
CASES
IN
THE
FORM
OF
TEXTILE
MILLS
THESE
MILLS
COULD
PRODUCE
CLOTH
FAR
MORE
EFFICIENTLY
AND
CHEAPLY
THAN
PEOPLE
AT
HOME
THE
RESULT
WAS
THAT
AN
IMPORTANT
SOURCE
OF
HOME
INCOME
WAS
WIPED
OUT
AND
MANY
OF
THESE
WOMEN
WERE
COMPELLED
BY
ECONOMIC
CIRCUMSTANCE
TO
GO
TO
WORK
IN
THESE
SAME
MILLS
IN
LOWELL
MASS
OR
NASHUA
NH
WHERE
THEY
WORKED
HOUR
WEEKS
IN
DEAFENING
DANGEROUS
CONDITIONS
LIVING
REGIMENTED
LIVES
AND
BEING
EXPOSED
TO
COTTONDUST
AND
INFECTIOUS
DIS
EASES
DUE
TO
THE
WORK
NOW
PEOPLE
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
BUY
THE
CHEAPER
FACTORYMADE
CLOTH
THEY
WERE
FREE
TO
KEEP
BUYING
THE
HOMEMADE
VARIETY
AND
SUPPORT
THEIR
LOCAL
ECONOMY
THINGS
ARE
DESIGNED
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
IN
ORDER
TO
GO
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
AND
MAKE
MONEY
EVERYTHING
ELSE
WE
CARE
ABOUT
GOES
TO
SHIT
BUT
SORRY
FOR
THE
CLICHE
IT
TAKES
TWO
TO
TANGO
THE
BIG
RICH
CORPORATIONS
ACHIEVED
THAT
WEALTH
BECAUSE
WE
BUY
THEIR
STUFF
IT
USED
TO
BE
THE
CASE
THAT
THE
BUSINESS
CENTER
OF
A
TOWN
WAS
ALSO
ITS
SOCIAL
CENTER
YOU
KNEW
THE
MERCHANTS
YOU
DID
BUSINESS
WITH
OR
EVEN
LOCAL
KIDS
WORKING
BEHIND
THE
COUNTER
YOU
WOULD
SEE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
STREET
WHOM
YOU
KNEW
AND
YOU
COULD
STOP
FOR
A
CHAT
NOWADAYS
LOCAL
MERCHANTS
ARE
GOING
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
AND
PEOPLE
SHOP
AT
HUGE
ANONYMOUS
MALLS
SERVING
REGIONAL
POPULATIONS
OF
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OR
MILLIONS
YOU
HAVE
NO
PARTICULAR
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE
COMPANIES
YOU
DO
BUSINESS
WITH
AND
FEEL
NO
PARTICULAR
COMMITMENT
TO
THEM
NOR
THEY
TO
YOU
MAJOR
COMPONENTS
OF
WHAT
DEFINES
A
COM
MUNITY
HAVE
BEEN
DESTROYED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
PRODUCTS
WE
BUY
AT
THESE
MALLS
ARE
A
LOT
CHEAPER
DUE
TO
ECONOMIES
OF
SCALE
AND
FOREIGN
MANUFACTURE
AND
THEY
ARE
PROBABLY
OF
BETTER
OR
AT
LEAST
MORE
CONSISTENT
QUALITY
I
HAVE
TO
CONSTANTLY
REMIND
MYSELF
THAT
THE
GOAL
OF
HUMAN
SOCIETY
IS
NOT
TO
MAKE
MONEY
MONEY
DOESNT
MAKE
US
HAPPY
IT
JUST
PREVENTS
CERTAIN
THINGS
MAKING
US
MORE
UNHAPPY
THEREFORE
DONT
SHOOT
THE
RICH
SHOOT
THE
CONSERVATIVES
DONT
BLAME
THE
CONSERVATIVES
FOR
THIS
EVERYONE
MAKES
THEIR
OWN
INDIVIDUAL
CHOICE
AND
THE
LIBERALS
AND
THE
FENCESITTERS
ARE
JUST
AS
GUILTY
OF
PRETENDING
THERE
ARE
NO
SOCIAL
AND
CULTURAL
CONSEQUENCES
TO
ECONOMIC
CHOICES
