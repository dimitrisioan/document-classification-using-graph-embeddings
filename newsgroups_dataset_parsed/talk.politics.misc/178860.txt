the
office

this
is
a
lie
the
senate
committee
issued
an
indictment
that
listed
nixons
crimes
the
relevant
ones
were
violating
his
oath
of
office
abusing
his

powers
personal
gain
for
his
own
monetary
advantage
i
dont
think
anyone
would
dispute
that
he
both
violated
his
oath
of
office
and
abused
his
powers
but
thats
not
for
personal

nothing
is
