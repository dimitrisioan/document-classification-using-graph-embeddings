however
legalizing
it
and
just
sticking
some
drugs
in
gas
stations
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
i
dont
find
this
silly
at
all
i
find
it
silly
black
humor
that
were
spending
billions
of
dollars
and
risking
the
lives
and
freedoms
of
every
american
to
save
a
bunch
of
bychoice
druggies
could
you
please
tell
us
why
you
find
this
silly
thats
why
letters
w
h
and
y
rather
than
arguments
like
oh
everbody
thinks
such
and
such
is
true
first
the
only
drug
that
could
possibly
be
put
in
drug
stations
are
marijuana
or
its
derivitives
every
other
drug
that
i
can
think
of
can
kill
you
if
you
take
to
much
by
the
very
nature
of
these
drugs
your
decision
making
skills
arent
up
to
par
that
is
how
it
differs
from
asprin
flinstone
vitamins
etc
we
dont
even
allow
penicilin
to
be
sold
over
the
counter
second
we
already
have
a
big
enough
drunk
driving
and
alchoholic
problem
in
this
country
if
marijuana
were
legal
undoubtedly
more
people
would
use
it
and
that
is
a
problem
people
use
it
get
stupid
and
hurt
other
people
