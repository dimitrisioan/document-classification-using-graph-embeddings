KENNEDY
JAMES
SCOT
WRITES
I
COMPLETELY
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THE
ILLEGAL
INVASION
OF
PANAMA
WAS
SOMETHING
MR
BUSH
NEVER
DID
HAVE
TO
ANSWER
FOR
REMEMBER
NOT
ONLY
DID
A
LOT
OF
PANAMANIAN
CIVILIANS
GET
KILLED
BUT
MORE
THAN
A
FEW
AMERICAN
SOLDIERS
DIED
TOO
ALL
THIS
FOR
ARRESTING
A
PETTY
DICTATOR
HERES
THE
ICING
ON
THE
CAKE
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
THE
FLOW
OF
DRUGS
FROM
PANAMA
HASNT
SLOWED
DOWN
AT
ALL
WITH
THE
REMOVAL
OF
NORIEGA
SO
WHAT
GOOD
DID
IT
DO
TO
REMOVE
HIM
FROM
POWER
THE
CIGARETTE
COPS
AND
THE
FBI
KILLING
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
IN
WACO
IS
EQUALLY
REPREHENSIBLE
BTW
IVE
CROSSPOSTED
THIS
ARTICLE
TO
TPD
BECAUSE
I
WANT
TO
HEAR
FROM
KNOWLEDGABLE
PEOPLE
ON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
ARREST
OF
NORIEGA
AFFECTED
THE
DRUG
TRADE
IN
ANY
WAY
THE
ARREST
OF
NORIEGA
DID
NOT
HAVE
ANY
MAJOR
ADVERSE
EFFECT
ON
THE
DRUG
TRADE
GOING
THROUGH
PANAMA
MONEY
LAUNDERING
CONTINUES
TO
BE
PANAMAS
MAIN
INDUSTRY
IN
FACT
IT
IS
BIGGER
NOW
THAN
BEFORE
NORIEGA
WAS
ARRESTED
PANAMAS
CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION
ALSO
HAS
TIES
WITH
THE
COLOMBIAN
COCAINE
CARTELS
AND
LARGE
AMOUNTS
COCAINE
STILL
FLOW

A
REGULAR
BASIS
