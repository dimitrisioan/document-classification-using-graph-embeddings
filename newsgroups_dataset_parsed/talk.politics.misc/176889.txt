with
a
tip
of
the
hat
to
david
letterman
for
making
the
top
ten
format
so
popular
top
ten
reasons
that
conservatives
dont
want
to
aid
russia
looking
around
who
where
dont
look
at
me
i
want
to
send
aid
to
russia
many
other
conservatives
do
as
well
yes
it
was
nixon
who
was
most
vocal
about
giving
money
to
russia
it
makes
me
proud
to
be
a
libertarian
it
appears
both
conservatives
and
liberals
prefer
to
cold
war
until
you
win
then
nurse
the
enemy
back
to
health
for
another
go
around
enemy
sounds
like
thats
the
viewpoint
of
the
stereotypical
rednecked
conservative
always
been
commies
always
will
be
i
suggest
you
listen
very
carefully
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
his
people
are
saying
and
compare
that
with
the
very
antiwest
slogans
coming
from
his
opponents
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
oh
btw
germany
has
sure
come
back
as
a
terrible
enemy
after
wwii
hasnt
it
its
like
subsidizing
the
wealthy
countries
japan
germany
etc
with
free
defense
and
then
tradewarring
with
them
because
of
the
economic
competition
its
like
subsidizing
tobacco
farmers
while
paying
bureaucrats
to
pursuade
people
not
to
smoke
better
to
let
them
degenerate
into
civil
war
remember
all
those
nuclear
weapons
in
russia
i
cannot
imagine
that
they
would
not
be
used
in
a
civil
war
if
nationialists
take
over
and
even
if
they
prevent
a
civil
war
most
feel
they
must
take
back
large
parts
of
land
that
are
in
other
countries
like
ukraine
i
also
cannot
imagine
ukraine
giving
up
land
without
a
fight
possibly
nuclear
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of
europe
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
i
ask
myself
what
law
could
we
pass
to
prevent
government
from
doing
stupid
frivilous
things
with
our
money
then
i
think
the
constitution
was
supposed
to
do
that
could
someone
please
tell
me
what
legitimate
constitutional
power
the
federal
government
is
using
when
it
takes
money
from
my
paycheck
and
gives
it
to
needy
countries
seriously
seriously
everyone
has
different
opinions
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
causes
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong
space
program
someone
else
will
champion
welfare
or
education
or
doing
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
that
is
why
we
have
a
republic
and
not
a
true
democracy
instead
of
gridlock
on
a
massive
scale
we
only
have
gridlock
on
a
congressional
scale
btw
who
is
to
decide
stupid
this
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarians
were
against
actually
my
politics
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
and
this
is
why
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
join
the
party
it
seems
that
libertarians
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
we
could
do
that
years
ago
but
not
now
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
beginnings
of
a
global
economy
and
global
decision
