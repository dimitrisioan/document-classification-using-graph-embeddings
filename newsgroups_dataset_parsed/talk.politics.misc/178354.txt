does
anyone
have
knowledge
about
how
this
was
handled
in
the
past
such
as
with
the
louisiana
territory
or
the
northwest
territory
those
areas
became
states
puerto
rico
has
the
population
needed
to
become
a
state
but
the
ethnic
mix
there
is
such
that
puerto
rico
will
probably
never
become
a
state
i
say
we
cut
them
loose
if
they
dont
want
to
become
a
state
we
shouldnt
continue
to
subsidize
their
existence
