the
result
is
that
clinton
now
hopes
to
reduce
the
deficit
to
a
level
above
where
it
was
when
reagan
left
office
which
considering
the
amount
bushcongress
added
to
it
would
be
a
notinconsiderable
achievement
while
were
on
the
subject
i
also
believe
that
the
supplyside
claim
that
reducing
taxes
raised
revenue
is
also
false
because
they
typically
factor
in
socsec
taxes
which
were
raised
a
considerable
amount
at
the
same
time
that
income
taxes
were
cut
if
you
look
at
income
tax
revenue
alone
it
fell
after
after
the
cuts
began
and
didnt
recover
for
several
years
by
then
record
deficits
were
well
entrenched
chew
on
that
awhile
