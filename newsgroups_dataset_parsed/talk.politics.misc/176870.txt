TOP
TEN
REASONS
THAT
CONSERVATIVES
DONT
WANT
TO
AID
RUSSIA
LOOKING
AROUND
WHO
WHERE
DONT
LOOK
AT
ME
I
WANT
TO
SEND
AID
TO
RUSSIA

DISCLAIMER
ALL
OPINIONS
HERE
BELONG
TO
MY
CAT
AND
NO
ONE
ELSE
YES
IT
WAS
NIXON
WHO
WAS
MOST
VOCAL
ABOUT
GIVING
MONEY
TO
RUSSIA
IT
MAKES
ME
PROUD
TO
BE
A
LIBERTARIAN
IT
APPEARS
BOTH
CONSERVATIVES
AND
LIBERALS
PREFER
TO
COLD
WAR
UNTIL
YOU
WIN
THEN
NURSE
THE
ENEMY
BACK
TO
HEALTH
FOR
ANOTHER
GO
AROUND
ITS
LIKE
SUBSIDIZING
THE
WEALTHY
COUNTRIES
JAPAN
GERMANY
ETC
WITH
FREE
DEFENSE
AND
THEN
TRADEWARRING
WITH
THEM
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ECONOMIC
COMPETITION
ITS
LIKE
SUBSIDIZING
TOBACCO
FARMERS
WHILE
PAYING
BUREAUCRATS
TO
PURSUADE
PEOPLE
NOT
TO
SMOKE
I
ASK
MYSELF
WHAT
LAW
COULD
WE
PASS
TO
PREVENT
GOVERNMENT
FROM
DOING
STUPID
FRIVILOUS
THINGS
WITH
OUR
MONEY
THEN
I
THINK
THE
CONSTITUTION
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
THAT
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHAT
LEGITIMATE
CONSTITUTIONAL
POWER
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IS
USING
WHEN
IT
TAKES
MONEY
FROM
MY
PAYCHECK
AND
GIVES
IT
TO
NEEDY
COUNTRIES
SERIOUSLY

IF
WE
WERE
DIRECTED
FROM
WASHINGTON
WHEN
TO
SOW
AND
WHEN
TO
REAP
WE
WOULD
SOON
