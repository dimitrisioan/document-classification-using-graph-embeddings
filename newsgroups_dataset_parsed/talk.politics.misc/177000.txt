writes
yet
when
a
law
was
proposed
for
virginia
that
extended
this
philosophy
to
cigarette
smokers
so
that
people
who
smoked
away
from
the
work
couldnt
be
discriminated
against
by
employers
the
liberal
gov
wilder
vetoed
it
which
shows
that
liberals
dont
give
a
damn
about
best
person
for
the
job
its
just
a
power
play
of
course
clayton
ignores
the
fact
that
employers
pay
health
insurance
and
insurance
for
smokers
is
more
expensive
than
for
nonsmokers
