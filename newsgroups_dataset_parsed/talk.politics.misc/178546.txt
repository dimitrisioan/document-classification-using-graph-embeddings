IT
IS
A
FAILURE
OF
LIBERTARIANISM
IF
THE
IDEOLOGY
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
ANY
REASONABLE
WAY
TO
RESTRAIN
SUCH
ACTIONS
OTHER
THAN
UTOPIAN
DREAMS
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
SAYING
THAT
A
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
WILL
PROVIDE
MORE
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
PRIVATE
INTERESTS
TO
USE
IT
TO
PURSUE
THEIR
OWN
AGENDAS
AND
ASKING
LIBERTARIANS
TO
PROVE
THAT
THIS
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
WHILE
I
CANT
OFFER
SUCH
A
PROOF
IT
SEEMS
PRETTY
DAMN
PLAUSIBLE
THAT
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
DOES
NOT
REGULATE
A
PARTICULAR
AREA
IT
CANNOT
BECOME
A
TOOL
OF
PRIVATE
INTERESTS
TO
PURSUE
THEIR
OWN
AGENDAS
IN
THAT
AREA
I
RATHER
SUSPECT
THAT
ITS
THE
SORT
OF
GOVERNMENT
WE
HAVE
NOW
THAT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BECOME
SUCH
A
TOOL
AND
THAT
IT
IS
SUCH
A
TOOL
IN
MANY
INSTANCES
PARDON
ME
FOR
INTERRUPTING
BUT
WHY
DOESNT
ANYONE
EVER
BRING
UP
OTHER
POSSIBILITIES
BESIDES
MORE
GOVERNMENT
LESS
GOVERNMENT
OR
NO
GOVERNMENT
AND
STOP
THERE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
PROBLEMS
WITH
SOCIETY
GO
MUCH
DEEPER
THAN
GOVERNMENT
DEMOCRACIES
SEEM
TO
REFLECTIVE
OF
THE
MAJORITY
OF
SOCIETY
BOTH
THE
GOOD
AND
THE
BAD
IF
YOU
TAKE
AWAY
THE
GOVERNMENT
YOU
STILL
HAVE
THE
STRUCTURAL
FLAWS
IN
SOCIETY
EXCEPT
THIS
TIME
WITH
NO
RESTRAINTS
YES
NO
WHY
DOESNT
ANYBODY
EVER
DISCUSS
COMMUNAL
SOCIETY
LIKE
A
KIBBUTZ
I
NEVER
STUDIED
IT
ON
DEPTH
BUT
FROM
WHAT
IVE
HEARD
THE
KIBBUTZ
IN
ISREAL
WAS
VERY
SUCCESSFUL
IT
IS
ALSO
VERY
CLOSE
TO
WHAT
ARISTOTLE
AND
SOCRATES
BELIEVED
WAS
THE
BEST
SORRY
TO
DETRACT
FROM
THE
DISCUSSION
JUST
AS
MARXISM
FAILS
TO
SPECIFY
HOW
PURE
COMMUNISM
IS
TO
BE
ACHIEVED
AND
THE
STATE
IS
TO
WITHER
AWAY
LIBERTARIANS
FREQUENTLY
FAIL
TO
SHOW
HOW
WEAKENING
THE
POWER
OF
THE
STATE
WILL
RESULT
IN
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
AS
YOU
DEFINE
IT
IS
NOT
THE
PRIMARY
GOAL
OF
LIBERTARIANISM
AND
WOULD
NOT
BE
THE
PRIMARY
GOAL
OF
A
LIBERTARIAN
GOVERNMENT
MY
IMPRESSION
OF
LIBERTARIANISM
IS
THAT
ITS
PRIMARY
GOAL
IS
THE
ELIMINATION
OF
GOVERNMENT
COERCION
EXCEPT
IN
A
VERY
LIMITED
CASES
BUT
WHAT
GOOD
IS
CHANGE
IF
THERE
IS
NO
TRACABLE
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
WHO
WOULD
EVER
SUPPORT
THE
CHANGE
IF
YOU
TELL
THEM
IT
WONT
IMPROVE
THEIR
LIVES
I
KNOW
THAT
THERE
ARE
AND
WILL
BE
LIBERTARIANS
WHO
WILL
JUMP
IN
NOW
AND
SAY
THAT
IT
WILL
IMPROVE
OUR
LIVES
I
CAN
DEAL
WITH
THAT
ALL
IM
SAYING
IS
THAT
IMPROVING
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
MUST
BE
THE
PRIMARY
GOAL
OF
ANY
ORGANIZATION
