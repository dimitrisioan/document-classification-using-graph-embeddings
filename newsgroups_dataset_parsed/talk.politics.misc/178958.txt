looks
like
the
wod
is
working
really
good
to
stop
people
from
being
screwed
up
in
the
head
given
that
example
issue
your
friend
got
his
drugslegal
or
not
legal
hell
continue
to
get
them
issue
why
should
i
as
somebody
who
does
not
use
illegal
drugs
and
who
is
not
screwed
up
have
to
pay
for
this
idiots
problems
hes
not
doing
anybody
any
harm
except
himself
the
wod
on
the
other
hand
is
an
immediate
threat
to
my
life
and
livelyhood
tell
me
why
i
should
sacrafice
this
to
that
hello
is
there
anybody
in
there
you
think
you
have
to
pay
for
this
idiots
problem
now
whos
going
to
pay
for
the
ballooning
number
of
addicts
and
all
of
the
associated
problems
with
them
i
dont
even
want
to
think
about
it
with
hillary
in
the
white
house
and
an
administration
that
feels
our
pain
no
harm
but
to
himself
what
about
when
he
drives
his
school
bus
full
of
kids
into
a
train
when
he
gets
stoned
and
drives
up
on
a
sidewalk
and
kills
people
when
he
lives
off
me
on
welfare
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
problem
with
the
wod
is
that
it
has
no
bite
sending
the
slimy
bastards
to
the
chair
for
selling
drugs
to
kids
now
theres
some
bit
