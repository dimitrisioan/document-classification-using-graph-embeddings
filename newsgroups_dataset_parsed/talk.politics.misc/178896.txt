well
the
obvious
point
to
make
is
would
straight
men
fuck
like
rabbits
if
the
oppertunity
presented
itself
i
reckon
any
man
would
go
wildly
promiscuous
if
presented
with
a
huge
variety
of
willing
partners
if
true
and
if
gays
were
the
same
as
straights
except
for
sexual
preference
i
would
imagine
that
gays
would
have
much
less
sex
than
straights
because
the
available
pool
for
dates
is
less
than
onetenth
what
it
is
for
straights
somebody
