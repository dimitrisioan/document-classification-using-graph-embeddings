re
new
study
out
on
gay
percentage
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
isnt
is
funny
how
someone
who
seems
to
know
nothing
about
homosexuality
uses
a
very
flawed
imho
source
of
information
to
pass
jusgement
on
all
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
it
would
seem
more
logical
to
say
that
since
the
heterosexual
group
of
men
is
larger
then
the
chances
of
promiscuity
larger
as
well
in
my
opinion
orientation
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
men
are
men
and
they
all
like
sex
i
am
a
gay
male
i
have
had
sex
three
times
in
my
life
all
with
the
same
man
before
that
i
was
a
virgin
so
whose
promiscuous
just
because
someone
is
gay
doesnt
mean
they
have
no
morals
just
because
someone
is
heterosexual
doesnt
mean
they
do
look
at
the
world
statistics
alone
prove
that
most
criminals
are
by
default
hetero
look
closely
at
the
person
not
the
group
all
flames
will
be
ignored
later
