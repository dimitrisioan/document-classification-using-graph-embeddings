re
debating
special
hate
crimes
laws
was
how
many
homosexuals
in
article

william
december
starr
writes
if
someone
beats
up
a
homosexual
he
should
get
charged
for
assault
and
battery
why
must
we
add
gay
bashing
to
the
list
isnt
this
a
sort
of
double
jeopardy
or
am
i
just
being
a
fascist
again
douglas
meier
assuming
the
questions
are
not
rhetorical
the
answers
are
to
deter
an
epidemic
of
gay
bashing
that
has
not
been
deterred
by
assault
laws
no
it
is
not
double
jeopardy
a
single
act
may
lead
to
multiple
charges
and
multiple
crimes
yes
lets
leave
aside
the
personalinsult
potential
that
doug
created
by
asking
his
last
question
and
just
concentrate
on
the
legalpolitical
debate
last
point
first
yes
a
single
act
may
lead
to
multiple
independent
charges
however
as
a
side
note
i
think
that
the
prohibition
on
double
jeopardy
mandates
that
the
suspect
be
tried
on
all
those
charges
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
trial
unless
of
course
the
government
can
pull
the
separate
sovereignties
crock
that
theyre
using
on
those
four
lapd
cops
who
arrested
rodney
king
ie
trying
a
person
whos
already
been
acquitted
in
state
court
on
federal
charges
arising
from
the
same
act
i
think
that
this
is
double
jeopardy
but
apparently
the
courts
dont
agree
with
me
note
that
the
laws
that
dont
agree
with
you
were
passed
to
protect
a
class
of
people
who
couldnt
get
justice
from
the
state
courts
specifically
civil
rights
workers
in
missisippi
in
the
the
federal
protection
of
individual
rights
supersedes
the
nonfeasance
of
the
state
something
similar
has
long
been
traditional
well
hes
queer
so
i
beat
him
up
for
gays
you
pays
your
money
and
you
takes
your
pick
me
i
lean
strongly
towards
the
against
argument
i
know
that
having
the
law
treat
everyone
as
equals
regardless
of
realities
will
not
in
and
of
itself
lead
to
true
equality
and
in
fact
may
lead
at
times
towards
greater
inequality
nonetheless
i
believe
that
true
equality
is
at
least
possible
when
the
laws
treat
people
as
being
equal
while
true
equality
is
by
definition
impossible
when
the
laws
themselves
mandate
unequal
treatment
of
classes
of
people
by
the
state
william

wdstarrathenamitedu
as
anatole
france
said
the
law
in
its
impartial
majesty
forbids
the
rich
as
well
as
the
poor
from
sleeping
under
bridges
equality
of
law
can
be
construed
in
any
number
of
ways
for
example
the
fact
that
all
property
thefts
regardless
of
value
are
not
punished
equally
is
an
inequality
which
protects
those
who
have
a
lot
of
money
from
having
it
stolen
you
could
easily
define
equality
to
regard
the
property
in
terms
of
its
significance
for
the
owner
this
would
a
form
of
equality
that
would
be
skewed
toward
poorer
people
in
fact
most
antigay
bashing
laws
are
constructed
to
offer
equal
protection
they
make
it
an
offense
to
damage
people
based
on
a
motivation
of
hatred
for
sexual
orientation
thus
the
law
in
its
impartial
majesty
protects
hets
as
well
as
gays
from
being
bashed
im
sure
thats
a
great
relief
