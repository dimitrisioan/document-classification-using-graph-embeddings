WRITES
IN
FACT
NO
ONE
HAS
SUCH
A
LIST
THE
CLINTON
PACKAGE
AS
PRESENTLY
PROPOSED
INCLUDES
A
VARIETY
OF
RECOMMENDED
SPENDING
AREAS
AND
DOLLAR
AMOUNTS
IT
DOES
NOT
INCLUDE
A
LINEBYLINE
LIST
OF
EVERY
PROJECT
THAT
WOULD
BE
FUNDED
CONGRESS
MAY
INCLUDE
SUCH
LINE
ITEMS
IN
THE
BILL
WHEN
IT
PASSES
LIKEWISE
IT
MAY
PROHIBIT
SPENDING
FOR
SPECIFIC
PROJECTS
AS
AMENDMENTS
TO
THE

SUCH
AMENDMENTS
POSITIVE
AND
NEGATIVE
ARE
OFTEN
POINTED
TO
BY
THOSE
WHO
PROPOSE
A
LINE
ITEM
VETO
OR
ENHANCED
RECISION
POWER
FOR
THE
PRESIDENT
SOME
OF
THE
BILLION
PACKAGE
IS
IN
THE
FORM
OF
BLOCK
GRANTS
TO
STATES
AND
LOCALITIES
THIS
IS
WHY
I
ASKED
TO
BE
ENLIGHTENED
YOU
ARE
MAKING
CLAIMS
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
OR
IS
NOT
PART
OF
THIS
PROGRAM
BUT
IF
THE
BLOCK
GRANTS
GO
TO
STATES
AND
CITIES
THE
MAYORS
LIST
IS
VERY
RELIVENT
ID
SUGGEST
CONTACTING
YOUR
LOCAL
OFFICIALS
READING
A
NEWSPAPER
WITH
GOOD
COVERAGE
OF
CONGRESS
WASHINGTON
POST
NY
TIMES
OR
IF
YOURE
SERIOUS
ABOUT
PAYING
ATTENTION
TO
THESE
ISSUES
GET
COPIES
OF
CONGRESSIONAL
QUARTERLY
AT
YOUR
LIBRARY
OR
HAVE
YOUR
REPRESENTATIVE
PUT
YOU
ON
THE
MAILING
LIST
FOR
THE
CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD
ITS
FREE
BUT
BE
PREPARED
TO
INVEST
MORE
TIME
IN
THE
EFFORT
THAN
IT
TAKES
TO
WATCH
THE
EVENING
NEWS
OR
READ
YOUR
LOCAL
PAPER
OKAY
SCARASM
DOES
DESERVE
SACRASM
BUT
I
ALREADY
CONTACT
MY
LOCAL
OFFICALS
MY
CONGRESS
REP
SENATORS
WATCH

NEWS

AND
CSPAN
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
CHERRY
PICKING
THAT
WENT
ON
WITH
THE
MAYORS
WISH
LIST
CONGRESSIONAL
REPUBLICANS
SELECTED
WISH
LIST
PROJECTS
FROM
A
VARIETY
OF
FEDERAL
AGENCIES
BASED
APPARENTLY
UPON
HOW
SILLY
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
PROJECTS
SOUNDED
IM
NOT
EVEN
SURE
IF
THEY
BOTHERED
TO
CORRELATE
A
POTENTIAL
EXPENDITURE
OF
AN
AGENCY
IN
CLINTONS
BILL
WITH
A
POTENTIAL
PROJECT
FROM
THE
SAME
AGENCY
BUT
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
EFFORT
WAS
TO
MAKE
CLINTONS
POTENTIAL
EXPENDITURES
APPEAR
TO
BE
LINKED
TO
PROJECTS
WITH
ABSURD
NAMES
NOT
TO
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
ANY
MORE
THAN
EQUIVALENT
TACTICS
BY
DEMOCRATS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
IN
THE
REAGANBUSH
ERA
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
PRIMETIME
TM
OF
ABC
HAS
HAD
NUMBEROUS
REPOSTS
ON
SUCH
WASTE
PROGRAMS
THAT
ALREADY
EXIST
AGAIN
IF
WE
ARE
TRUELY
INTRESTED
IN
ELIMINATING
THE
DEBT
WE
MUST
REMOVE
THE
DEFICIT
AND
DO
AWAY
WITH
ALL
PORK
I
REALIZE
THAT
IT
IS
TEMPTING
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
GOVERNMENT
IS
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
CLOWNS
WHO
ARE
DISHONEST
AT
BEST
BUT
SUCH
SIMPLISTIC
ANALYSIS
DOES
LITTLE
TO
ADVANCE
THE
CAUSE
OF
PUBLIC
EDUCATION
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SEVERAL
BOOKS
WRITTEN
ON
GOV
WASTE
NETWORK
NEWS
PROGRAMS
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
DEVOTE
SEGMENTS
TO
THIS
AND
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
BILLS
PROPOSED
THAT
SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCES
EXPENDITURES
WITHOUT
TOUCHING
EXTERNAL
PROGRAMS
BY
CHANGING
THE
WAY
CONGRESS
DOES
BUSINESS
AND
MAKE
IT
MORE
EFFICENT
TRUE
BLAME
IS
EASY
BUT
ALSO
IS
SPENDING
SOMEONE
ELSES
MONEY
CLINTON
RAN
ON
A
PLATFORM
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
RAISE
TAXES
ON
THE
MIDDLE
CLASS
TO
PAY
FOR
THESE
HIS
PROGRAMS
HE
HAS
PROPOSED
A
PROGRAM
THAT
IS
NOT
