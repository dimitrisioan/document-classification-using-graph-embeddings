was
quite
disgusting
in
that
way
the
reports
of
the
women
that
he
coerced
via
power
of
the
office
are
now
in
the
dozens
today
wed
call
for
immediate
resignation
for
that
kind
of
behaviour
i
guess
coercing
women
into
having
sex
is
much
worse
than
stealing
breaking
and
entering
rigging
national
elections
starting
secret
wars
that
kill
hundreds
of
thousands
and
using
the
powers
of
your
office
for
personal
gain
like
nixon
did
not
garrett
you
are
a
really
pathetic
liar
isnt
name
calling
fun
some
of
your
charges
are
arguable
but
most
of
them
are
obvious
lies
i
challenge
you
to
present
us
with
any
evidence
that
nixon
stole
rigged
a
national
election
never
mind
elections
or
used
the
powers
of
his
office
for
personal
gain
what
do
you
think
happened
at
watergate
what
do
you
think
they
broke
into
the
building
for
it
wasnt
to
just
look
around
do
i
have
to
draw
you
a
picture
you
cant
because
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
any
of
these
events
occurred
whatever
who
said
anything
about
panicking
snapped
authur
garrett
johnson
this
is
still
just
culture
shock
you
wait
till
ive
garrettingrescom
settled
into
the
situation
and
found
my
bearings
then
ill
start
panicking
