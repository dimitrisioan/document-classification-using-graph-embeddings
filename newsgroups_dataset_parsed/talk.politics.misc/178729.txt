re
a
message
for
you
mr
president
how
do
you
know
what
happened
in
billtrianglecsuofsedu
bill
gunshannon
writes
there
is
no
such
thing
as
nontoxic
tear
gas
tear
gas
is
nonbreathable
remaining
in
its
presence
will
cause
nausea
and
vomiting
followed
eventually
by
siezures
and
death
did
the
fbi
know
the
physical
health
of
all
the
people
they
exposed
any
potential
heart
problems
among
the
bds
they
certainly
knew
that
there
were
pregnant
women
in
there
plus
children
i
could
not
believe
when
they
said
that
the
gassing
was
an
attempt
to
save
the
children
yesterday
i
cant
think
of
a
much
worse
sort
of
child
abuse
that
pouring
tear
gas
into
a
building
have
you
ever
seen
a
tear
gas
canister
tear
gas
is
produced
by
burning
a
chemical
in
the
can
the
fumes
produced
are
tear
gas
the
canister
has
a
warning
printed
on
the
side
of
it
contact
with
flamable
material
can
result
in
fire
now
how
many
of
these
canisters
did
they
throw
inside
a
building
they
admited
was
a
firetrap
i
have
heard
two
things
recently
explaining
this
they
pumped
the
gas
into
the
building
from
outside
via
some
sort
of
pipe
rather
than
by
canister
the
sort
of
tear
gas
they
are
using
was
described
as
some
sort
of
powdery
material
that
sticks
to
things
kind
of
like
a
powder
cloud
and
once
again
these
are
government
lacky
explainations
and
since
government
stories
always
change
none
or
all
of
the
information
might
not
be
true
this
whole
thing
was
a
case
of
overreaction
by
the
officials
at
every
step
i
hope
it
is
thoroughly
investigated
and
the
responsible
parties
are
held
accountable
but
that
is
highly
unlikely
when
you
figure
they
are
going
to
be
investigating
themselves
or
better
yet
the
texas
rangers
will
be
investigating
which
is
probably
worse
than
the
fbi
or
atf
investigating
itself
