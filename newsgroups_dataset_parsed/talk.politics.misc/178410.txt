p
male
sex
survey
gay
activity
low
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
the
figures
on
homosexuality
in
the
study
released
wednesday
by
the
alan
guttmacher
institute
are
significantly
lower
than
the
percent
figure
that
has
been
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
since
it
was
published
in
the
kinsey
report
so
what
so
there
are
less
gays
then
the
gays
claim
last
i
checked
i
was
one
person
i
havent
even
been
elected
as
a
representative
for
gaydom
should
i
ascribe
every
thing
you
say
as
representing
every
member
of
the
straight
community
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
dream
on
abortion
and
africanamerican
civil
rights
rallies
dont
even
bring
in
half
of
that
thats
the
point
if
there
are
several
million
queers
in
dc
you
had
better
start
wondering
about
the
validity
of
the
study
join
the
pythagorean

church
repent
of
your
evil
irrational
numbers
and
