says
the
earth
may
spew
alot
of
substances
into
the
atmosphere
but
the
quality
of
your
toxic
output
can
easily
make
up
for
the
lack
of
quantity
excuse
me
quality
as
in
grade
a
and
grade
b
i
may
not
have
this
quite
right
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
was
furthermore
the
planet
is
a
system
of
carbon
sulfur
and
other
chemicals
which
have
been
acting
for
billions
of
years
we
are
but
newcomers
to
the
system
we
must
adapt
and
control
in
order
to
bring
about
stability
also
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right
so
continuing
our
practices
despite
overwhelming
data
is
just
ignorance
in
nonaction
a
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
this
system
is
inherently
stable
the
ice
ages
occured
without
any
help
from
humans
b
the
point
was
that
the
human
contribution
of
and
other
greenhouse
gasses
is
insignificant
and
it
wont
really
make
a
difference
if
we
make
more
or
less
c
what
overwhelming
data
i
see
lots
of
projections
of
the
future
which
is
fascinating
considering
they
cant
predict
the
weather
two
weeks
in
advance
