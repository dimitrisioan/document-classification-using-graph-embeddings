I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
LEGAL
PRECEDENT
DEFINES
A
HUMAN
BEING
IE
A
PERSON
WHOSE
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
THE
LAW
AS
SOMEONE
WITH
A
FUNCTIONING
BRAIN
NO
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
USE
LEGAL
PRECEDENT
YOU
SHOULD
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
MODEL
PENAL
CODE
ON
WHICH
MANY
STATES
BASE
THEIR
CRIMINAL
CODE
MY
APOLOGIES
IF
I
WAS
UNCLEAR
I
WAS
NOT
TRYING
TO
START
A
STATUTORY
DEBATE
SINCE
THERE
ARE
MANY
IN
SOME
CASES
CONFLICTING
STATUTES
ON
THE
BOOKS
I
WAS
MERELY
SUGGESTING
A
PARADIGM
THAT
MIGHT
MAKE
SENSE
FOR
A
PROCHOICER
IMHO
CITE
ONE
OF
THESE
CONFLICTING
STATUTES
YOU
KEEP
MAKING
THESE
ASSERTIONS
BUT
YOU
HAVENT
SUPPORTED
ANY
OF
THEM
YET
I
AM
SPEAKING
OF
STATUTES
THAT
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
DEFINITION
LARRY
POSTED
WHY
DID
YOU
DELETE
THE
CODE
THAT
LARRY
POSTED
ALSO
THE
MODEL
PENAL
CODE
MADE
PERFECT
SENSE
TO
ME
WERE
YOU
PERHAPS
CONFUSED
BY
IT
ALSO
I
AM
STILL
LOOKING
FOR
YOUR
DEFINITION
THE
ONE
YOU
USED
CLEARLY
INDICATES
THAT
A
FETUS
IS
NOT
A
HUMAN
BEING
THIS
IS
NOT
LIKELY
TO
PLEASE
EITHER
PROLIFERS
OR
PROCHOICERS
BUT
IT
IS
PRETTY
CLEAR
FROM
THE
LEGALMEDICAL
CONCEPT
OF
BRAIN
DEATH
BRAIN
DEATH
IS
A
METHOD
OF
DECIDING
WHEN
A
KNOWN
PERSON
IS
LEGALLY
DEAD
THERES
NO
ANALOGOUS
CONCEPT
OF
BRAIN
BIRTH
I
HAVE
JUST
COINED
IT
YOU
MAY
OBJECT
TO
THE
PARADIGM
BUT
IT
WOULD
MAKE
OUR
TREATMENT
OF
HUMAN
LIFE
STATUTORILY
CONSISTENT
CIRCULAR
ARGUMENTS
ARE
USUALLY
VERY
CONSISTENT
IF
A
PARENT
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
CHOOSE
TO
NOT
TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THEIR
OWN
CHILD
WHY
ARE
THERE
LAWS
AND
PENALTIES
AGAINST
CHILD
ABANDONMENT
THIS
LAST
QUESTION
IS
IRRELEVANT
AND
SOMETHING
OF
A
NON
SEQUITUR
CAN
YOU
ESTABLISH
SOME
RELEVANCE
OR
EVEN
SOME
SENSE
FOR
IT
IF
AT
SOME
POINT
AN
UNBORN
CHILD
IS
A
HUMAN
BEING
THE
PARENTS
CLEARLY
HAVE
THE
SAME
RESPONSIBILITIES
TOWARD
HER
AS
ANY
OTHER
PARENTS
HAVE
TOWARD
THEIR
CHILDREN
AND
NO
PARENT
CAN
BE
FORCED
TO
SUPPLY
BODILY
RESOURCES
TOWARD
THEIR
CHILDREN
EVEN
IF
NECESSARY
TO
SAVE
THE
CHILDS
LIFE
THERE
IS
A
CONFUSION
HERE
BETWEEN
ACTION
AND
INACTION
A
PARENT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
RUN
OUT
IN
FRONT
OF
A
BUS
TO
SAVE
THEIR
CHILDS
LIFE
EITHER
BUT
A
PARENT
IS
REQUIRED
TO
FEED
HIS
CHILDREN
AGAIN
YOUR
DESIRE
FOR
CONSISTENCY
DISAPPEARS
WHEN
IT
DOES
NOT
SUIT
YOUR
NEEDS
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
PROTECTING
LIFE
IS
ABANDONED
BASED
ON
ACTION
VERSUS
INACTION
NOT
MUCH
OF
A
PRINCIPLE
SUDDENLY
YOU
RECOGNIZE
THAT
THE
CLAIM
ON
BODILY
RESOURCES
IS
DEPENDENT
ON
CIRCUMSTANCES
OTHER
THAN
THIS
PRINCIPLE
OF
LIFE
THATS
A
VERY
CONEVNIENT
PRINCIPLE
YOU
HAVE
THERE
