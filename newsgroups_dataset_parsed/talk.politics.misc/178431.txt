it
is
a
failure
of
libertarianism
if
the
ideology
does
not
provide
any
reasonable
way
to
restrain
such
actions
other
than
utopian
dreams
society
would
collapse
if
most
people
were
evil
most
of
the
time
david
bergland
agreed
if
people
are
basically
evil
the
last
thing
youd
want
is
a
big
government
staffed
by
those
evil
folks
exercising
control
over
you
david
bergland
agreed
freedom
seems
to
have
unleashed
the
creative
energies
of
the
people
and
leads
to
ever
higher
levels
of
income
and
social
progress
un
report
agreed
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limited
government
and
those
who
want
unlimited
government
it
is
between
those
who
believe
government
regulation
in
a
capitalist
economy
serves
worthwhile
ends
and
those
who
believe
such
regulation
is
neither
desirable
on
empirical
grounds
nor
justifiable
on
ideological
grounds
good
summary
selling
your
labor
or
goods
so
that
you
can
eat
and
buy
a
house
is
essential
so
that
you
can
excercise
your
personal
freedoms
