a
few
questions
for
janet
reno
why
dont
you
think
generals
have
any
place
in
law
enforcement
if
the
atffbi
had
proof
that
koresh
was
a
child
molester
a
child
abuser
a
wife
abuser
bigamist
sexual
deviant
not
a
crime
in
all
states
yet
as
well
as
illegally
modify
weapons
why
wasnt
he
simply
arrested
during
one
of
his
morning
jogs
why
did
the
allegations
of
childwifesex
crimes
only
come
out
after
the
branch
davidians
repelled
the
initial
assualt
was
it
because
it
became
necessary
to
demonize
david
koresh
do
you
feel
responsible
for
the
deaths
of
over
people
how
many
would
be
alive
to
day
if
koresh
had
been
arrested
outside
the
compound
inquiring
minds
want
to
know
although
janet
was
installed
after
the
siege
began
her
purge
of
the
justice
dept
leaves
only
her
people
in
charge
brett

nothing
so
passionate
as
a
vested
interest
disguised
as
an
intellectual
conviction
