response
to
dave
borden
you
selfish
little
bastard
afraid
you
might
have
to
sacrafice
somthing
for
your
country
what
someone
not
approve
a
lone
for
you
to
bad
what
is
immoral
is
people
like
you
and
the
current
president
who
dont
have
any
idea
why
this
country
still
exists
after
years
william
if
the
reason
that
this
country
still
stands
after
years
is
that
it
uses
military
conscription
to
force
young
men
to
fight
for
causes
that
they
dont
believe
in
strongly
enough
to
volunteer
for
military
service
in
support
of
then
perhaps
the
fact
that
the
country
is
still
standing
is
not
good
news
