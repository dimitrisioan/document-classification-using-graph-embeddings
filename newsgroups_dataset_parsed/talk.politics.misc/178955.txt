just
what
is
in
the
jobspork
bill
this
was
in
wed
wsj
start
the
white
house
seeking
to
mount
public
pressure
on
gop
senators
bombarded
news
outlets
in
some
senators
home
states
with
news
releases
warning
that
certain
projects
may
not
be
funded
if
the
stimulus
bill
isnt
passed
none
of
the
projects
mentioned
are
actually
in
the
bill
rather
they
are
part
of
a
wish
list
that
may
be
funded
from
the
billion
in
community
development
block
grants
end
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
a
bunch
of
clintonites
going
on
and
on
raving
about
how
dishonest
it
was
that
the
rebublicans
were
taking
items
from
this
wish
list
in
order
to
ridicule
this
bill
now
that
clinton
is
using
that
same
list
in
order
to
garner
support
for
the
bill
are
you
guys
going
to
do
the
honarable
thing
and
say
that
clinton
is
being
dishonest
mob
rule
isnt
any
prettier
merely
because
the
mob
calls
itself
a
government
it
aint
charity
if
you
are
using
someone
elses
money
wilsons
