CRITISISM
IS
TOO
EASY
WHAT
SOLUTIONS
DO
PEOPLE
HAVE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BETTER
THAN
WHAT
THE
FBI
HAD
BEEN
DOING
FOR
THE
LAST
FEW
MONTHS
FOR
STARTERS
THEY
COULD
HAVE
GONE
ON
WAITING
AND
NEGOTIATING
THE
DAVIDIANS
WERENT
GOING
ANYWHERE
AND
THEIR
SUPPLIES
HAD
TO
BE
LIMITED
LARGE
PERHAPS
BUT
LIMITED
IF
THEY
HAD
SIMPLY
FIRED
THE
COMPOUND
BY
THEMSELVES
WITHOUT
GOVT
TANKS
SMASHING
DOWN
THEIR
WALLS
THEN
AT
LEAST
THE
GOVT
WOULD
NOT
BE
GUILTY
OF
HAVING
AGAIN
USED
AN
INAPPROPRIATE
LEVEL
OF
FORCE
AND
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
USE
THE
MEANTIME
TO
CONTINUE
TO
PRESSURE
AND
NEGOTIATE
NO
THEY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
LOOKED
GOOD
ON
THE
NEWS
IN
SIX
MONTHS
OR
A
YEAR
BUT
THEY
SURE
AS
HELL
DONT
LOOK
VERY
GOOD
NOW
TRUE

INTERVIEWED
A
FORMER
UNIFICATION
CHURCH
LEADER
WHO
IS
NOW
A
CONSULTANT
ON
CULTS
HE
SAID
THE
FBIS
APPROACH
WAS
TOTALLY
WRONG
HE
SAID
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
TRIED
TO
BREAK
DOWN
THE
BDS
LOYALTY
TO
KORESH
THROUGH
PSYCHOLOGICAL
MEANS
KORESHS
WHOLE
THEOLOGY
WAS
BASED
ON
AN
APPROACHING
CONFRONTATION
WITH
THE
FORCES
OF
EVIL
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
A
SEIGE
MENTALITY
BASED
ON
THIS
THE
FEDS
PLAYED
INTO
HIS
HANDS
PERFECTLY
BY
SURROUNDING
THE
COMPOUND
WITH
TANKS
AND
PLAYING
LOUD
ROCK
MUSIC
AND
GLARING
LIGHTS
AT
THEM
THEY
STRONGLY
REINFORCED
KORESHS
MESSAGE
THAT
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD
WAS
EVIL
AND
THREATENING
HE
SAID
INSTEAD
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
SET
UP
A
PICNIC
ATMOSPHERE
AND
ACTED
INVITING
AND
FRIENDLY
IF
THEY
BROADCAST
ANYTHING
OVER
PA
SYSTEMS
IT
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
LOVING
RELATIVES
REFLECTING
ON
PLEASANT
EVENTS
FROM
THE
CULT
MEMBERS
CHILDHOODS
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
MAKE
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD
AND
SURRENDER
SEEM
LIKE
A
PLEASANT
DESIRABLE
ALTERNATIVE
INTERESTING
