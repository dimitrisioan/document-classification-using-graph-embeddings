if
someone
beats
up
a
homosexual
he
should
get
charged
for
assault
and
battery
why
must
we
add
gay
bashing
to
the
list
isnt
this
a
sort
of
double
jeopardy
or
am
i
just
being
a
fascist
again
to
deter
an
epidemic
of
gay
bashing
that
has
not
been
deterred
by
assault
laws
so
we
ought
to
make
beating
up
a
homosexual
more
illegal
than
beating
up
a
straight
silly
me
thinking
that
the
issue
was
that
we
are
all
people
to
be
treated
equally
thanks
for
straightening
me
out
wrong
if
a
bunch
of
faggots
from
the
tenderloin
decide
to
go
straight
bashing
and
they
selectively
target
a
heterosexual
man
and
beat
the
bloody
fuck
out
of
him
they
would
get
charged
as
well
under
all
the
federal
laws
that
exist
about
violation
of
civils
rights
the
focus
of
their
intent
is
his
sexual
orientation
and
so
the
law
applies
to
them
as
well
the
national
government
retains
the
right
to
make
any
laws
necessary
to
sufficiently
deter
and
punish
any
crime
against
someones
civil
rights
until
that
behavior
becomes
so
well
punished
that
nobody
even
tries
it
the
fact
is
that
at
last
count
gays
were
not
beating
straights
for
their
sexual
orientation
thus
the
law
is
getting
applied
only
to
the
straights
who
indulge
themselves
the
federal
government
or
judiciary
has
the
right
to
enforce
the
amendment
guarantee
of
equal
protection
under
law
even
if
it
takes
possible
charges
against
people
who
would
violate
them
go
read
your
constitutional
law
we
broke
the
back
of
the
kkks
harrassment
campaign
with
the
same
strategy
in
the
early
so
many
went
to
jail
and
for
so
long
that
it
cut
the
heart
out
of
the
kkk
rsw
no
it
is
not
double
jeopardy
a
single
act
may
lead
to
multiple
charges
and
multiple
crimes
i
think
what
you
meant
to
say
here
was
with
the
current
mutation
of
the
us
constitution
under
the
current
police
state
someone
may
be
charged
multiple
times
for
one
act
if
the
victim
in
question
is
of
the
right
shade
a
single
act
should
never
merit
more
than
on
charge
thats
almost
like
if
four
cops
got
acquitted
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
charges
and
the
country
went
and
tried
them
again
and
again
until
they
oh
never
mind
this
mutation
as
you
call
it
protects
your
little
butt
too
if
you
happen
to
be
somewhere
where
youre
the
wrong
shade
for
somebody
elses
taste
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
motive
for
the
assault
on
you
was
racially
motivated
then
the
full
power
of
these
extra
laws
that
bring
more
charges
and
punishments
will
come
against
those
who
harmed
you
the
first
use
of
such
laws
was
well
over
a
hundred
years
ago
and
constitutional
scholars
of
all
conviction
recognize
that
this
right
reserved
to
the
federal
government
is
well
established
and
not
just
some
shortlived
peculiarity
too
go
read
some
constitutional
law
for
awhile
maybe
youll
get
it
