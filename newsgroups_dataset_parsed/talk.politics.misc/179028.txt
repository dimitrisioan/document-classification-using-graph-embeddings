well
it
really
doesnt
matter
anyway
because
i
really
dont
care
what
liars
think
of
me
anyway
what
did
i
call
you
liars
you
want
proof
id
be
glad
to
provide
it
im
really
sure
which
ones
of
you
said
these
things
since
you
all
sound
the
same
anyway
one
of
you
said
nixon
didnt
start
any
secret
wars
this
is
a
lie
nixon
had
full
knowledge
of
the
invasions
of
laos
and
cambodia
and
then
lied
to
the
american
public
about
it
note
however
that
these
were
military
actions
but
not
wars
what
a
joke
you
cant
actually
believe
what
you
just
said
can
you
we
bombed
and
invaded
these
countries
notice
the
definition
of
war
from
the
american
heritage
dictionary
a
state
or
period
of
armed
conflict
between
nations
or
states
this
qualifies
the
invasions
of
cambodia
and
laos
as
wars
one
of
you
said
nixon
didnt
use
the
office
of
the
presidency
for
personal
gain
this
is
a
lie
the
senate
committee
issued
an
indictment
that
listed
nixons
crimes
the
relevant
ones
were
violating
his
oath
of
office
abusing
his
presidential
powers
excuse
me
but
neither
of
these
refer
to
personal
gain
then
let
me
explain
this
to
you
really
slowly
why
did
he
abuse
the
powers
of
his
position
could
it
have
been
to
gain
personal
political
power
naw
that
would
be
too
obvious
so
now
youre
big
thing
that
you
have
been
flogging
me
with
is
that
i
mistook
prc
for
peoples
republic
of
cambodia
since
i
knew
that
cambodia
was
socialist
at
the
time
and
since
your
comment
was
right
in
middle
of
a
conversation
about
cambodia
i
made
the
wrong
assumption
that
we
were
talking
about
the
same
thing
ah
but
garrett
anyone
who
has
to
make
assumptions
about
the
meaning
of
the
initials
prc
in
a
discussion
about
asia
is
breathtakingly
ignorant
and
anyone
who
can
only
call
names
because
his
position
is
defensless
is
breathtakingly
ignorant
and
desperate
i
noticed
that
you
edited
out
the
other
points
were
i
proved
you
and
phil
to
be
completely
wrong
death
to
all
modifiers
he
declared
one
day
and
out
of
garrett
johnson
every
letter
that
passed
through
his
hands
went
every
garrettingrescom
adverb
and
adjective
the
next
day
he
made
war
on
articles
the
following
day
he
blacked
out
everything
in
the
letters
but
a
an
and
the
