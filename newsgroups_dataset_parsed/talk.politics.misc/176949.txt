says
that
either
the
parade
organizers
want
to
show
support
for
nambla
or
they
themselves
have
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
their
rights
and
responsibilities

really
like
to
believe

latter
but

would
need
some
help
to

there
are
dozens
of
examples
of

nambla

especially

hardly
the
only

they
had
some
clue
in
this
regard
dozens
of
examples
