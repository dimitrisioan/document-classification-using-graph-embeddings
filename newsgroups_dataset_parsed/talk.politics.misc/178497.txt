THAT
SAID
THE
OCCUPANT
OF
THE
TRUCK
WAS
DEAD
FROM
THE
IMPACT
NOT
FROM
THE

THOUGHTS
ITS
KIND
OF
SCARY
WHEN
YOU
REALIZE
THAT
JUDGES
ARE
GOING
TO
START
DENYING
NEW
TRIALS
EVEN
WHEN
NEW
EVIDENCE
THAT
CONTRADICTS
THE
FACTS
THAT
LED
TO
THE
PREVIOUS
RULING
APPEAR
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IT
WOULD
BE
KIND
OF
SCARY
IF
THERE
WERE
NEVER
A
FINAL
VERDICT
BECAUSE
A
PARTY
TO
LITIGATION
COULD
KEEP
SAYING
OOPS
I
FORGOT
TO
BRING

A
NEW

SHOULDNT
THAT
BE
ENOUGH
FOR
A

TO
THROUGH
OUT
THE
OLD
VERDICT
AND
CALL
FOR
A

DID
