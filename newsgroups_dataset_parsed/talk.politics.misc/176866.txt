SICK

TIRED
WAS
RE
BILL
CONKLIN
ET
AL
S
LETTER
REPLYING
TO
AJ
TEEL
WELL
THE
TWO
NIFTY
LETTERS
GIVING
CONCRETE
PROOF
THAT
THE
INCOME
TAX
IS
VOLUNTARY
AND
GIVING
SPECIFIC
PROCEDURES
FOR
STOPPING
WITHHOLDING
ET
CETERA
HAVE
BEEN
OUT
THERE
FOR
A
WHILE
NOW
HUMBUG
THOSE
LETTERS
DONT
PROVIDE
CONCRETE
PROOF
OF
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
ANY
CASE
LAW
THAT
DEMONSTRATES
THE
METHOD
WILL
ACTU
ALLY
WORK
FOR
ORDINARY
PEOPLE
IN
EVERYDAY
SITUATIONS
SPECIFICALLY
SHOW
US
SOME
CASE
LAW
IN
WHICH
THE
COURTS
HAVE
RULED
THAT
INCOME
TAX
IS
ILLEGAL
ANDOR
THAT
ORDINARY
WORKING
TYPES
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
PAY
INCOME
TAX
AND
THAT
THEY
CAN
LEGALLY
AVOID
PAYING
INCOME
TAX
WITH
OUT
DECLARING
THEMSELVES
TO
BE
CHURCHES
OR
SOME
SUCH
SILLINESS
THIS
ISSUE
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
IMPORTANT
THAT
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
EXPECT
SOMETHING
SQUARELY
ON
POINT
FROM
THE
US
SUPREME
COURT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
FEDERAL
TAX
OR
A
STATES
SUPREME
COURT
FOR
A
STATES
INCOME
TAX
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
DO
THAT
I
FOR
ONE
AM
UNWILLING
TO
CALL
YOUR
MATERIAL
CONCRETE
PROOF
THERE
HAS
BEEN
NO
REFUTATION
TO
DATE
HAVE
THE
NAYSAYERS
FINALLY
GIVEN
UP
AS
DEFEATED
SURE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
THEIR
REASONS
FOR
DISBELIEF
AT
THIS
POINT
REFUTATION
REFUTATION
OF
WHAT
YOU
HAVENT
MADE
A
CASE
YET
YOUVE
POSTED
PLENTY
OF
CLAIMS
BUT
YOU
HAVENT
GIVEN
US
ANY
VALID
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ANY
COURT
IN
THE
US
WILL
AGREE
WITH
YOU
YOUR
CLAIMS
SEEM
ON
THE
SURFACE
TO
DEVIATE
SO
RADICALLY
FROM
THE
LEGAL
MAINSTREAM
THAT
I
FEEL
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IS
STILL
ON
YOU
TO
SHOW
THAT
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
HAVE
ANY
MERIT
WHATSOEVER
AND
THE
CASES
YOUVE
CITED
INVOLVE
SUCH
STRANGE
SITUATIONS
THAT
I
SEE
NO
REASON
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THE
RULINGS
ARE
APPLICABLE
TO
ANYONE
ELSE
OR
THAT
THEY
WILL
ULTIMATELY
STAND
ON
APPEAL
TO
THE
SUPREME
COURT
WHY
CANT
YOU
JUST
CITE
US
A
CASE
IN
WHICH
JOE
SCHMOE
A
REGULAR
EMPLOYEE
EARNING
REGULAR
WAGES
FROM
A
REGULAR
COMPANY
REFUSES
TO
PAY
HIS
INCOME
TAX
GETS
HAULED
INTO
COURT
IS
CONVICTED
OF
WILFUL
TAX
EVA
SION
AND
THEN
HAS
HIS
CONVICTION
OVERTURNED
BY
THE
US
SUPREME
COURT
WITH
A
LANDMARK
MAJORITY
RULING
THAT
INCOME
TAX
IS
INDEED
TOTALLY
VOLUNTARY
WHAT
YOU
SAY
NO
SUCH
CASE
EXISTS
HMMM
I
WONDER
WHY
NOT
WHY
HAVENT
YOU
SHALL
I
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
POINT
HAS
BEEN
RECEIVED
AND
THE
OPPOSITION
HAS
FORFEITED
THE
FIELD
WITH
ALL
DUE
RESPECT
YOU
CAN
CONCLUDE
ANYTHING
YOU
WANT
I
JUST
HOPE
FOR
YOUR
OWN
SAKE
THAT
YOU
DONT
CONCLUDE
THAT
ANYONE
IN
A
POSITION
OF
AUTHORITY
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
OR
ANY
LEGITIMATE
OR
ILLEGITIMATE
POLIT
ICAL
SUBDIVISION
THEREOF
IS
GOING
TO
AGREE
WITH
YOUR
CONCLUSIONS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
I
CONFESS
IM
THOROUGHLY
CONFUSED
AS
TO
WHY
YOU
WOULD
BE
LOOKING
FOR
COURT
RULINGS
IN
YOUR
FAVOR
ANYWAY
SINCE
I
THOUGHT
YOU
TOLD
US
EARLIER
THAT
EVERY
COURT
IN
THE
US
HAS
BEEN
IN
CAHOOTS
WITH
BIG
BANKING
INTERESTS
SINCE
THE
ADMIRALTY
JURISDICTION
COVERUP
THING
DO
YOU
HONESTLY
EXPECT
US
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THEYD
GO
TO
ALL
THE
TROUBLE
TO
SUBVERT
THE
SYSTEM
AND
YET
WOULD
STILL
PROMPTLY
SLINK
BACK
INTO
THEIR
BURROWS
IN
THE
FACE
OF
ANYONE
WHO
KNEW
ENOUGH
TO
INVOKE
THE
RIGHT
COMBINATION
OF
MAGIC
SPELLS
AND
MYSTIC
MUMBOJUMBO
NOT
ONLY
THAT
BUT
WHY
DO
YOU
EVEN
CARE
WHAT
THE
US
COURTS
SAY
ANYWAY
DIDNT
YOU
TELL
US
A
WHILE
BACK
THAT
YOUVE
DISAVOWED
ALL
ATTEMPTS
BY
US
OFFICIALS
TO
CLASSIFY
YOU
AS
A
AMENDMENT
FEDERAL
CITIZEN
WHEN
THE
FBI
COMES
TO
HAUL
YOU
AWAY
FOR
TAX
EVASION
WHY
DONT
YOU
JUST
TELL
THEM
THEYRE
OUT
OF
THEIR
JURISDICTION
AND
SHOULD
GO
BACK
TO
WASHINGTON
DC
WHERE
THEY
BELONG
OR
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
ALL
JUST
GO
BACK
TO
MEDIAEVAL
COMMON
LAW
WHICH
YOU
SUGGESTED
WOULD
BE
BETTER
THAN
ALL
THESE
STATUTES
CODES
AND
THE
LIKE
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
RENOUNCE
SOCIETYS
LEGAL
FRAMEWORK
FINE
WE
CAN
JUST
DECLARE
YOU
AN
OUTLAW
OK
AND
ANYONE
WHO
SEES
YOU
DRIVING
ON
THE
ROADS
WITH
NO
LICENSE
PLATE
ON
YOUR
CAR
AND
NO
DRIVERS
LICENSE
IN
YOUR
WALLET
CAN
JUST
TAKE
YOU
LIKE
A
GAME
ANIMAL
AND
STEW
YOU
FOR
THEIR
SUPPER
WITH
PLENTY
OF
VEGGIES
AND
A
PINCH
OF
SALT
BUT
WITHOUT
PREJUDICE
UCC
SORRY
EVERYONE
ITS
GETTING
LATE
AND
IM
SICK
AND
TIRED
OF
ALL
THIS
GARBAGE
IF
I
KNOW
WHATS
GOOD
FOR
ME
ILL
JUST
CLAM
UP
AND
STOP
TRY
ING
TO
REFUTE
THIS
NONSENSE
AND
IF
ANYONE
FALLS
FOR
IT
AND
WINDS
UP
IN
JAIL
FOR
TAX
EVASION
OR
WHATNOT
ITLL
BE
ON
THEIR

HEAD
NEEDLESS
TO

NONE
OF
THE
