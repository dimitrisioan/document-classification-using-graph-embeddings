INSANITY

PATRICK
KEARNEY
WRITES
ASSUMING
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
THAT
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIAN
PEOPLE
IMMOLATED
THEMSELVES
IN
THE
MANNER
DESCRIBED
BY
THE
FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES
WHY
DOES
THE
GENERAL
CONSENSUS
APPEAR
TO
BE
THAT
THEY
THE
BD
WERE
INSANE
IS
IT
THE
MANNER
OF
THEIR
BEHAVIOUR
BEFORE
THEY
DIED
OR
THE
FACT
THEY
CHOSE
TO
KILL
THEMSELVES
RATHER
THAN
SUBMIT
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
I
ASK
THIS
QUESTION
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
A
TRADITION
AND
ONE
THAT
IS
HIGHLY
REGARDED
BY
MANY
PEOPLE
THAT
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
JEWS
ELECTED
TO
THROW
THEMSELVES
OFF
A
CLIFF
AT
MASADA
RATHER
THAN
SUBMIT
TO
ROMAN
RULE
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
AT
MASADA
AND
THOSE
AT
WACO
WOULD
SEEM
IN
GENERAL
TERMS
QUITE
SIMILAR
AND
YET
SO
FAR
AS
IM
AWARE
NOBODY
HAS
SERIOUSLY
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
JEWS
WERE
INSANE
THE
POINT
OF
THIS
COMPARISON
IS
TO
QUESTION
THE
USE
OF
THE
WORD
CULT
IN
DISCUSSING
THE
EVENTS
AT
WACO
WHY
WERE
THE
DAVIDIANS
A
CULT
AND
NOT
THE
JEWS
AT
MASADA
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
A
CULT
IS
IT
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
MEMBERSHIP
OR
A
MATTER
OF
RESPECTABILITY
OR
PERHAPS
THE
LENGTH
OF
TIME
ITS
BEEN
IN
EXISTENCE
ARE
THE
CATHOLICS
A
CULT
HOW
ABOUT
THE
MORMONS
OR
THE
CALVINISTS
IS
A
SECT
A
RESPECTIBLE
CULT
DICTIONARY
DEFINITIONS
ASIDE
SINCE
POPULAR
USAGE
SEEMS
TO
CARRY
MORE
WEIGHT
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
WORD
CULT
IS
USED
IN
A
PERJORIVE
SENSE
WHEN
SPEAKING
OF
GROUPS
LIKE
THE
DAVIDIANS
IT
IS
RATHER
LIKE
THE
WORD
BOSS
WHEN
USED
TO
DESCRIBE
SOMEONE
UNPOPULAR
OR
SOMEONE
THE
GOVERNMENT
WISHES
TO
MAKE
UNPOPULAR
LIKE
SAY
CASTRO
THE
COMMUNIST
BOSS
OF
CUBA
ONE
DOESNT
HEAR
CLINTON
DESCRIBED
AS
AMERICAS
DEMOCRATIC
OR
CAPITALIST
BOSS
WELL
FOR
ONE
THING
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
THE
DIVIDIANS
DEPENDING
ON
WHETHER
THEY
COULD
SHOW
THEY
ACTED
IN
SELFDEFENSE
AND
THERE
WERE
NO
ILLEGAL
WEAPONS
COULD
HAVE
GONE
ON
WITH
THEIR
LIFE
AS
THEY
WERE
LIVING
IT
NO
ONE
WAS
FORCING
THEM
TO
GIVE
UP
THEIR
RELIGION
OR
EVEN
THEIR
LEGAL
WEAPONS
THE
DIVIDIANS
HAD
SURVIVED
A
CHANGE
IN
LEADERSHIP
BEFORE
SO
EVEN
IF
KORESCH
HIMSELF
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONVICTED
AND
SENT
TO
JAIL
THEY
STILL
COULD
HAVE
CARRIED
ON
I
DONT
THINK
THE
DIVIDIANS
WERE
INSANE
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
A
REASON
FOR
MASS
SUICIDE
IF
THE
FIRE
WAS
INTENTIONAL
SET
BY
SOME
OF
THE
DIVIDIANS
WE
ALSO
DONT
KNOW
THAT
IF
THE
FIRE
WAS
INTENTIONALLY
SET
FROM
INSIDE
WAS
IT
A
GENERALLY
KNOW
PLAN
OR
WAS
THIS
SOMETHING
ONLY
AN
INNER
CIRCLE
KNEW
ABOUT
OR
WAS
IT
SOMETHING
TWO
OR
THREE
FELT
THEY
HAD
TO
DO
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
KORESCHS
KNOWLEDGEBLESSING
ETC
I
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
MASADA
WERE
SOME
PEOPLE
THROWING
OTHERS
OVER
DID
MOTHERS
JUMP
OVER
WITH
THEIR
BABIES
IN
THEIR
ARMS
