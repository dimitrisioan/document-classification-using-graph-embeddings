MITCHELL
S
TODD
WRITES
WHY
IS
AN
ACCIDENTAL
FIRE
MORE
PLAUSIBLE
THAN
A
MASS
SUICIDE
CONSIDERING
THAT
THE
DAVIDIANS
WERE
AN
APOCALYPTIC
CULT
WITH
A
HISTORY
OF
ARMED
VIOLENCE
BECAUSE
THE
PLACE
WAS
A
TINDER
BOX
WITH
STRAW
BALES
FOR
INSULATION
AND
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
TIME
TO
DIE
FROM
SMOKE
INHALATION
BEFORE
THE
FIRE
REACHED
THEM
THOSE
PEOPLE
BURNED
TO
DEATH
A
TRULY
HORRIBLE
AND
AGONIZINGLY
PAINFUL
WAY
TO
DIE
WHICH
I
DONT
THINK
EVEN
A
FANATIC
WOULD
WILLINGLY
INFLICT
ON
HIMSELF
LET
ALONE
HIS
FAMILY
YOU
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
THE
FALL
OF
DIEMS
GOVERNMENT
IN
VIETNAM
OR
THE
TRADITIONAL
INDIAN
PRACTICE
OF
SUTTEE
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
BURNING
THEMSELVES
TO
DEATH
OR
WILLING
TO
GO
THROUGH
SUCH
AND
END
FOR
POLITICAL
AND
RELIGIOUS
REASONS
SINCE
THE
BEGINNING
OF
TIME
ALSO
DEATH
FROM
SMOKE
INHALATION
IS
LITTLE
BETTER
THAN
DYING
FROM
THE
FLAMES
THEMSELVES
THINK
ABOUT
BREATNING
IN
SEARING
TOXIC
GASSES
ITS
NOT
PLEASANT
TO
ANYONE
WHO
REMEMBERED
JIM
JONES
AND
WHO
THOUGHT
THAT
MASS
SUICIDE
WAS
A
REAL
POSSIBILITY
SELFIMMOLATION
WOULD
SIMPLY
NOT
BE
THE
METHOD
OF
CHOICE
THEN
AGAIN
TO
A
BUDDHIST
MONK
IT
MIGHT
BE
TO
EACH
HIS
OWN
FAR
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
BOMBS
BULLETS
OR
POISONED
KOOLAID
THATS
NOT
TO
SAY
THEY
DEFINITELY
DIDNT
DO
IT
I
DONT
MAKE
CLAIMS
EITHER
WAY
BUT
I
FIND
THE
IDEA
IMPLAUSIBLE
ENOUGH
TO
WANT
TO
SEE
THE
GOVT
THOROUGHLY
INVES
TIGATED
TO
DETERMINE
IF
THEY
STARTED
THE
FIRE
BY
ACCIDENT
IM
WAITING
TO
SEE
WHAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
TOO
