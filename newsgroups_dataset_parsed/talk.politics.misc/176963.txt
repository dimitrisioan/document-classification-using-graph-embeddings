balderdash
americas
reputation
abroad
has
become
tarnished
because
of
feckless
and
pusillanimous
cowards
who
apparently
do
not
have
the
requisite
gonads
to
stand
up
for
american
honor

dignity
dont
be
ridiculous
kaldis
i
suggest
you
give
the
ugly
american
concept
which
i
can
easily
see
you
demonstrating
a
good
hard
second
look
the
american
way
is
not
the
only
way
its
not
necessarally
the
best
way
and
it
is
incredibly
arrogant
to
even
think
that
the
american
way
may
not
be
the
only
way
and
you
may
not
consider
it
to
be
necessarily
the
best
way
but
by
god
its
our
way
and
were
going
to
stick
with
it
if
you
cant
go
along
with
the
program
then
perhaps
you
should
consider
moving
elsewhere
dear
god
didnt
this
die
out
in
the
fifties
with
mccarthy
and
the
blacklists
ive
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
in
different
provinces
of
canada
and
let
me
tell
you
it
is
very
refreshing
to
spend
time
with
people
who
are
not
full
of
arrogant
nationalism
and
empty
patriotism
that
is
exactly
the
problem
with
canadians
they
dont
stand
for
anything
with
certitude
didnt
your
mother
ever
teach
you
not
to
generalize
i
am
a
canadian
and
i
stand
up
for
too
many
things
with
too
much
certitude
the
canadians
i
know
well
enough
to
say
this
about
seem
to
have
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
their
provinces
and
their
country
but
they
arent
blinded
by
flags
and
ideals
like
many
americans
are
could
this
be
because
they
are
bereft
of
ideals
uh
huh
this
must
explain
the
world

i
see
now
its
all
becoming
so
clear
to
me
well
ive
said
too
much
yes
you
have
no
he
hasnt
but
i
was
so
angered
by
your
words
that
i
felt
i
had
to
say
something
sorry
to
intrude
you
pipsqueak
you
mouse
if
you
are
sorry
to
intrude
then
why
do
it
dont
you
have
the
courage
of
your
convictions
hell
do
you
even
have
any
convictions
to
start
with
what
kind
of
example
of
manly
dignity
is
this
sheesh
remarkable
audacity
and
misguidance
what
you
take
for
your
own
courage
sir
is
nothing
more
than
simple
loudmouthedness
coupled
with
unrestrained
bragging
please
allow
me
