re
the
continuing
decay
much
blathering
on
the
role
of
military
forces
in
enforcing
civil
law
deleted
the
main
problem
with
trying
to
get
the
military
involved
in
police
work
is
the
differences
in
the
missions
the
police
take
names
try
and
find
out
what
happened
stop
suspects
thats
the
meaning
of
arrest
and
turn
them
over
to
the
custody
of
the
judicial
branch
for
the
adjudication
of
their
case
the
militarys
mission
is
to
kill
the
enemy
before
they
can
escape
or
surrender
