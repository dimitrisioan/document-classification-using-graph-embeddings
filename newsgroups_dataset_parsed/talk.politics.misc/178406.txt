MEET
PERSONALLY
WITH
CITIZENS
HERE
TO
DISCUSS
MY

AND
THE

DO
MY
WEEKLY
BROADCAST
WITH
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
IM
TOLD
THIS
STATION
FIRST
BROADCAST
IN
WHEN
IT
REPORTED
THAT
YEARS
PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS
OVER
THE
PAST
SEVEN
DECADES
PRESIDENTS
HAVE
FOUND
WAYS
TO
KEEP
IN
TOUCH
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
FROM
WHISTLESTOP
TOURS
TO
FIRESIDE
CHATS
TO
THE
BUS
TOUR
THAT
I
ADOPTED
ALONG
WITH
VICE
PRESIDENT
GORE
IN
LAST
YEARS
CAMPAIGN
EVERY
SATURDAY
MORNING
I
TAKE
THIS
TIME
TO
TALK
WITH
YOU
MY
FELLOW
AMERICANS
ABOUT
THE
PROBLEMS
ON
YOUR
MINDS
AND
WHAT
IM
DOING
TO
TRY
AND
SOLVE
THEM
ITS
MY
WAY
OF
REPORTING
TO
YOU
AND
OF
GIVING
YOU
A
WAY
TO
HOLD
ME
ACCOUNTABLE
YOU
SENT
ME
TO
WASHINGTON
TO
GET
OUR
GOVERNMENT
AND
ECONOMY
MOVING
AFTER
YEARS
OF
PARALYSIS
AND
POLICY
AND
A
BAD
EXPERIMENT
WITH
TRICKLEDOWN
ECONOMICS
YOU
KNOW
HOW
IMPORTANT
IT
IS
FOR
US
TO
MAKE
BOLD
COMPREHENSIVE
CHANGES
IN
THE
WAY
WE
DO
BUSINESS
WE
LIVE
IN
A
COMPETITIVE
GLOBAL
ECONOMY
NATIONS
RISE
AND
FALL
ON
THE
SKILLS
OF
THEIR
WORKERS
THE
COMPETITIVENESS
OF
THEIR
COMPANIES
THE
IMAGINATION
OF
THEIR
INDUSTRIES
AND
THE
COOPERATIVE
EXPERIENCE
AND
SPIRIT
THAT
EXISTS
BETWEEN
BUSINESS
LABOR
AND
GOVERNMENT
ALTHOUGH
MANY
OF
THE
ECONOMIES
OF
THE
INDUSTRIALIZED
WORLD
ARE
NOW
SUFFERING
FROM
SLOW
GROWTH
THEYVE
MADE
MANY
OF
THE
SMART
INVESTMENTS
AND
THE
TOUGH
CHOICES
WHICH
OUR
GOVERNMENT
HAS
FOR
TOO
LONG
IGNORED
THATS
WHY
MANY
OF
THEM
HAVE
BEEN
MOVING
AHEAD
AND
TOO
MANY
OF
OUR
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
FALLING
BEHIND
WE
HAVE
AN
ECONOMY
TODAY
THAT
EVEN
WHEN
IT
GROWS
IS
NOT
PRODUCING
NEW
JOBS
WEVE
INCREASED
THE
DEBT
OF
OUR
NATION
BY
FOUR
TIMES
OVER
THE
LAST
YEARS
AND
WE
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
TO
SHOW
FOR
IT
WE
KNOW
THAT
WAGES
OF
MOST
WORKING
PEOPLE
HAVE
STOPPED
RISING
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
WORKING
LONGER
WORK
WEEKS
AND
THAT
TOO
MANY
FAMILIES
CAN
NO
LONGER
AFFORD
THE
ESCALATING
COST
OF
HEALTH
CARE
BUT
WE
ALSO
KNOW
THAT
GIVEN
THE
RIGHT
TOOLS
THE
RIGHT
INCENTIVES
AND
THE
RIGHT
ENCOURAGEMENT
OUR
WORKERS
AND
BUSINESSES
CAN
MAKE
THE
KINDS
OF
PRODUCTS
AND
PROFITS
OUR
ECONOMY
NEEDS
TO
EXPAND
OPPORTUNITY
AND
TO
MAKE
OUR
COMMUNITIES
BETTER
PLACES
TO
LIVE
IN
MANY
CRITICAL
PRODUCTS
TODAY
AMERICANS
ARE
THE
LOW
COST
HIGH
QUALITY
PRODUCERS
OUR
TASK
IS
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
WE
CREATE
MORE
OF
THOSE
KINDS
OF
JOBS
JUST
TWO
MONTHS
AGO
I
GAVE
CONGRESS
MY
PLAN
FOR
LONGTERM
JOBS
AND
ECONOMIC
GROWTH
IT
CHANGES
THE
OLD
PRIORITIES
IN
WASHINGTON
AND
PUTS
OUR
EMPHASIS
WHERE
IT
NEEDS
TO
BE
ON
PEOPLES
REAL
NEEDS
ON
INCREASING
INVESTMENTS
AND
JOBS
AND
EDUCATION
ON
CUTTING
THE
FEDERAL
DEFICIT
ON
STOPPING
THE
WASTE
WHICH
PAYS
NO
DIVIDENDS
AND
REDIRECTING
OUR
PRECIOUS
RESOURCES
TOWARD
INVESTMENT
THAT
CREATES
JOBS
NOW
AND
LAYS
THE
GROUNDWORK
FOR
ROBUST
ECONOMIC
GROWTH
IN
THE
FUTURE
THESE
NEW
DIRECTIONS
PASSED
THE
CONGRESS
IN
RECORD
TIME
AND
CREATED
A
NEW
SENSE
OF
HOPE
AND
OPPORTUNITY
IN
OUR
COUNTRY
THEN
THE
JOBS
PLAN
I
PRESENTED
TO
CONGRESS
WHICH
WOULD
CREATE
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
JOBS
MOST
OF
THEM
IN
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
IN
AND
PASSED
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
IT
NOW
HAS
THE
SUPPORT
OF
A
MAJORITY
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
SENATE
BUT
ITS
BEEN
HELD
UP
BY
A
FILIBUSTER
OF
A
MINORITY
IN
THE
SENATE
JUST
SENATORS
THEY
BLOCKED
A
VOTE
THAT
THEY
KNOW
WOULD
RESULT
IN
THE
PASSAGE
OF
OUR
BILL
AND
THE
CREATION
OF
JOBS
THE
ISSUE
ISNT
POLITICS
THE
ISSUE
IS
PEOPLE
MILLIONS
OF
AMERICANS
ARE
WAITING
FOR
THIS
LEGISLATION
AND
COUNTING
ON
IT
COUNTING
ON
US
IN
WASHINGTON
BUT
THE
JOBS
BILL
HAS
BEEN
GROUNDED
BY
GRIDLOCK
I
KNOW
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
ARE
TIRED
OF
BUSINESS
AS
USUAL
AND
POLITICS
AS
USUAL
I
KNOW
THEY
DONT
WANT
US
TO
SPIN
OR
WHEELS
THEY
WANT
THE
RECOVERY
TO
GET
MOVING
SO
I
HAVE
TAKEN
A
FIRST
STEP
TO
BREAK
THIS
GRIDLOCK
AND
GONE
THE
EXTRA
MILE
YESTERDAY
I
OFFERED
TO
CUT
THE
SIZE
OF
THIS
PLAN
BY
PERCENT
FROM
BILLION
TO
BILLION
ITS
NOT
WHAT
ID
HOPED
FOR
WITH
MILLION
AMERICANS
LOOKING
FOR
FULLTIME
WORK
I
SIMPLY
CANT
LET
THE
BILL
LANGUISH
WHEN
I
KNOW
THAT
EVEN
A
COMPROMISE
BILL
WILL
MEAN
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
JOBS
FOR
OUR
PEOPLE
THE
MANDATE
IS
TO
ACT
TO
ACHIEVE
CHANGE
AND
MOVE
THE
COUNTRY
FORWARD
BY
TAKING
THIS
INITIATIVE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
AN
UNRELENTING
SENATE
TALKATHON
I
THINK
WE
CAN
RESPOND
TO
YOUR
MANDATE
AND
ACHIEVE
A
SIGNIFICANT
PORTION
OF
OUR
ORIGINAL
GOALS
FIRST
WE
WANT
TO
KEEP
THE
PROGRAMS
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
THAT
ARE
NEEDED
TO
GENERATE
JOBS
AND
MEET
HUMAN
NEEDS
INCLUDING
HIGHWAY
AND
ROAD
CONSTRUCTION
SUMMER
JOBS
FOR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
IMMUNIZATION
FOR
CHILDREN
CONSTRUCTION
OF
WASTE
WATER
SITES
AND
AID
TO
SMALL
BUSINESSES
WE
ALSO
WANT
TO
KEEP
FUNDING
FOR
EXTENDED
UNEMPLOYMENT
COMPENSATION
BENEFITS
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
UNEMPLOYED
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BECAUSE
THE
ECONOMY
ISNT
CREATING
JOBS
SECOND
IVE
RECOMMENDED
THAT
ALL
THE
OTHER
PROGRAMS
IN
THE
BILL
BE
CUT
ACROSSTHEBOARD
BY
A
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
PERCENT
AND
THIRD
IVE
RECOMMENDED
A
NEW
ELEMENT
IN
THIS
PROGRAM
TO
HELP
US
IMMEDIATELY
START
OUR
ATTEMPT
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
CRIME
BY
PROVIDING
MILLION
FOR
CITIES
AND
TOWNS
TO
REHIRE
POLICE
OFFICERS
WHO
LOST
THEIR
JOBS
DURING
THE
RECESSION
AND
PUT
THEM
BACK
TO
WORK
PROTECTING
OUR
PEOPLE
IM
ALSO
GOING
TO
FIGHT
FOR
A
TOUGH
CRIME
BILL
BECAUSE
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
NEED
IT
AND
DESERVE
IT
NOW
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
FILIBUSTERING
THIS
BILL
THE
REPUBLICAN
SENATORS
SAY
THEY
WONT
VOTE
FOR
IT
BECAUSE
IT
INCREASES
DEFICIT
SPENDING
BECAUSE
THERES
EXTRA
SPENDING
THIS
YEAR
THAT
HASNT
ALREADY
BEEN
APPROVED
THAT
SOUNDS
REASONABLE
DOESNT
IT
HERES
WHAT
THEY
DONT
SAY
THIS
PROGRAM
IS
MORE
THAN
PAID
FOR
BY
BUDGET
CUTS
OVER
MY
FIVEYEAR
BUDGET
AND
THIS
BUDGET
IS
WELL
WITHIN
THE
SPENDING
LIMITS
ALREADY
APPROVED
BY
THE
CONGRESS
THIS
YEAR
ITS
AMAZING
TO
ME
THAT
MANY
OF
THESE
SAME
SENATORS
WHO
ARE
FILIBUSTERING
THE
BILL
VOTED
DURING
THE
PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION
FOR
BILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
OF
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
EMERGENCY
SPENDING
AND
MUCH
OF
IT
WAS
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
PUT
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
TO
WORK
THIS
IS
NOT
ABOUT
DEFICIT
SPENDING
WE
HAVE
OFFERED
A
PLAN
TO
CUT
THE
DEFICIT
THIS
IS
ABOUT
WHERE
YOUR
PRIORITIES
ARE
ON
PEOPLE
OR
ON
POLITICS
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
OUR
JOBS
BILL
IS
PAID
FOR
DOLLAR
FOR
DOLLAR
IT
IS
PAID
FOR
BY
BUDGET
CUTS
AND
ITS
THE
SOUNDEST
INVESTMENT
WE
CAN
NOW
MAKE
FOR
OURSELVES
AND
OUR
CHILDREN
I
URGE
ALL
AMERICANS
TO
TAKE
ANOTHER
LOOK
AT
THIS
JOBS
AND
INVESTMENT
PROGRAM
TO
CONSIDER
AGAIN
THE
BENEFITS
FOR
ALL
OF
US
WHEN
WEVE
HELPED
MAKE
MORE
AMERICAN
PARTNERS
WORKING
TO
ENSURE
THE
FUTURE
OF
OUR
NATION
AND
THE
STRENGTH
OF
OUR
ECONOMY
YOU
KNOW
IF
EVERY
AMERICAN
WHO
WANTED
A
JOB
HAD
ONE
WE
WOULDNT
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
THE
OTHER
PROBLEMS
WE
HAVE
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
TODAY
THIS
BILL
IS
NOT
A
MIRACLE
ITS
A
MODEST
FIRST
STEP
TO
TRY
TO
SET
OFF
A
JOB
CREATION
EXPLOSION
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AGAIN
BUT
ITS
A
STEP
WE
OUGHT
TO
TAKE
AND
IT
IS
FULLY
PAID
FOR
OVER
THE
LIFE
OF
OUR
BUDGET
TELL
YOUR
LAWMAKERS
WHAT
YOU
THINK
TELL
THEM
HOW
IMPORTANT
THE
BILL
IS
IF
IT
PASSES
WELL
ALL
BE
WINNERS
GOOD
MORNING
AND
THANK
YOU
FOR
LISTENING
END
