THE
ENTIRE
SECOND
TRIAL
WAS
ABOUT
RACE
TED
I
DONT
FEEL
COMPELLED
TO
DISCUSS
MR
KINGS
RACIAL
BACKGROUND
BUT
HAD
MR
KING
BEEN
WHITE
THERE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
A
SECOND
TRIAL
YOU
PROBABLY
ARE
SAYING
THAT
THE
BEATING
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
OCCURRED
IF
HE
WERE
WHITE
BUT
THAT
IS
AN
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
CALL
TO
MAKE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THE
CASE
BUT
NOT
DEFINATELY
ONE
COULD
EASILY
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
JURY
DECIDED
THAT
THIS
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
CALL
COULD
BE
MADE
WHICH
IS
WHY
THE
TWO
OF
THE
DEFENDANTS
WERE
FOUND
GUILTY
ONE
COULD
ALSO
MAKE
SOME
INTERESTING
OBSERVATIONS
ON
OUR
SYSTEM
OF
JUSTICE
WHERE
THE
MEN
WERE
NOT
GUILTY
OF
EXCESSIVE
FORCE
BUT
GUILTY
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
VIOLATED
HIS
CIVIL
RIGHTS
BY
USE
OF
THE
NONEXISTANT
EXCESSIVE
FORCE
IT
IS
ALSO
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
POWELL
AND
MAYBE
KOONS
WERE
FOUND
GUILTY
OF
AIDING
AND
ABETTING
THE
DEPRIVAL
