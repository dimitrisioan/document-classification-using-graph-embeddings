actually
i
was
rather
surprised
to
see
an
article
on
this
subject
ie
the
new
inproved
survey
saying
that
roughly
of
men
are
gay
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times
recently
i
think
it
was
on
thurs
april
the
headline
was
something
to
the
effect
of
new
survey
finds
of
men
are
gay
i
was
shocked
not
because
the
new
york
times
was
running
a
story
on
a
sex
survey
although
that
was
part
of
it
but
because
they
thought
that
this
news
was
actually
important
enough
to
warrant
front
page
space
i
mean
how
many
people
actually
care
how
many
people
are
gay
as
long
as
you
know
how
to
findavoid
them
if
you
want
to
i
dont
if
you
dont
care
why
was
so
much
effort
put
into
promoting
the
lie
because
it
was
important
to
scare
politicians
into
obedience
