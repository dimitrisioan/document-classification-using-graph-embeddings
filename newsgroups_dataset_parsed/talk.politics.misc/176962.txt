IS
THIS
TRUE
SOME

WOULD

YES
SADLY
THIS
IS
TRUE
THE
PRIMARY
REASON
AND
THE
ESSENCE
OF
THE
DETAILS
THAT
YOU
ARE
SEEKING
IS
THAT
THE
GRAHMRUDMAN
BUDGET
CONTROLS
WERE
WORKING

EXPANSION
AND
THE

FIRST
ACT
AS
PRESIDENT
SO
THAT
HE
COULD
CREATE
HIS
OWN
NEW
PLAN
WITH
MORE
TAX
INCREASES
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
CLINTON
NOW
HOPES
TO
REDUCE
THE
DEFICIT

A
LEVEL
ABOVE
WHERE
IT
WAS
WHEN
