the
deficits
declined
from
reaching
a
low
of
of
gnp
before
the
tax
and
spending
hike
of
reversed
the
trend
brett
is
this
true
some
more
details
would
be
appreciated
yes
sadly
this
is
true
the
primary
reason
and
the
essence
of
the
details
that
you
are
seeking
is
that
the
grahmrudman
budget
controls
were
working
in
fact
they
were
working
so
well
that
unless
the
feds
did
something
they
were
going
to
have
to
start
cutting
pork
so
bush
and
the
democrats
got
together
in
a
budget
summit
and
replaced
grahmrudman
with
the
now
historic
grand
compromise
in
which
bush
consented
to
raise
taxes
in
exchange
for
certain
caps
on
spending
increases
as
it
turned
out
the
taxes
killed
the
reagan
expansion
and
the
caps
on
spending
increases
were
dispelled
by
clinton
in
his
first
act
as
president
so
that
he
could
create
his
own
new
plan
with
more
tax
increases
the
result
is
that
clinton
now
hopes
to
reduce
the
deficit
to
a
level
above
where
it
was
when
reagan
left
office
chew
on
that
awhile
