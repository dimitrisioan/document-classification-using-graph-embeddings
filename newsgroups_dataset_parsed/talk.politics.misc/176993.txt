urgent
ted
frank
wanted
for
killing
aj
teel
his
account
that
is
many
important
issues
and
some
notso
important
ones
are
discussed
here
on
the
net
on
a
daily
basis
i
have
just
been
informed
of
what
i
feel
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
that
we
could
ever
discuss
the
outandout
censorship
of
one
of
our
fellow
posters
because
some
people
dont
like
what
he
says
or
thinks
we
have
all
seen
the
postings
here
by
aj
teel
although
many
of
us
have
not
agreed
with
their
content
im
sure
most
of
us
have
been
at
least
somewhat
interested
in
them
i
for
one
am
greatful
to
live
i
thought
in
a
country
where
people
like
mr
teel
are
allowed
to
say
what
they
please
if
i
dont
want
to
read
it
i
can
just
skip
on
by
or
unsuscribe
but
unfortunately
some
people
cannot
let
others
live
and
let
live
they
feel
an
overwhelming
need
to
snuff
out
the
little
bastards
now
it
seems
that
mr
teel
will
be
with
us
no
more
due
mainly
to
our
brother
and
cheif
net
police
ted
frank
please
help
aj

access

injustice

ted

well
well
well
thanks
to
eckpanixcom
mark
eckenwiler
and
ted
frank
my
account
is
to
be
axed
i
guess
that
the
information
i
am
presenting
is
just
toooo
difficult
for
them
to
deal
with
they
only
ted
and
mark
have
complained
to
my
sysadmin
some
unknown
number
of
times
to
get
me
off
the
net
in
his
defense
mark
sent
only
one
message
and
it
was
not
that
bad
it
has
been
posted
in
one
of
the
newsgroups
however
it
was
not
directed
at
me
as
would
be
common
practice
and
i
am
very
good
at
responding
via
netmail
while
i
disagree
with
ted
i
would
not
send
mail
to
his
sysadmin
to
get
him
axed
namecalling
was
not
enough
jumping
on
every
post
i
made
was
not
enough
ignoring
specific
points
when
they
were
not
what
the
desired
picture
was
not
enough
simply
ignoring
me
if
i
am
such
a
kook
was
not
enough
even
now
i
do
not
wish
to
have
him
axed
but
i
do
wish
to
express
my
disgust
about
this
argumentum
ad
silenceyouropponentum
i
would
have
thought
he
would
have
wanted
me
to
stay
around
just
to
have
someone
to
yell
about
and
seem
sooo
wise
to
himself
i
think
the
issue
that
seems
to
be
is
the
following
an
advertisement
apparently
ted
and
mark
think
so
i
posted
an
article
from
around
one
year
ago
as
it
was
taken
off
the
net
from
last
year
if
reposting
an
article
constitutes
posting
an
ad
then
i
am
guilty
this
post
did
have
a
name
and
address
and
yes
a
price
if
one
had
posted
the
address
and
subscription
price
of
newsweek
would
that
be
an
ad
i
get
nothing
from
showing
this
stuff
i
posted
a
list
of
documents
showing
examples
of
the
kind
of
proof
that
was
requested
by
ted
frank
he
then
complains
to
my
sysadmin
saying
that
i
am
advertising
and
lo
and
behold
poof
there
goes
my
account
this
one
had
an
address
in
it
oh
no
i
guess
that
means
it
is
an
ad
if
you
value
the
alternative
view
i
have
been
discussing
or
value
its
discussion
even
if
you
do
not
agree
with
it
i
ask
that
you
send
a
note
saying
as
much
to
me
to
show
to
the
sysadmin
they
rarely
get
ya
know
that
user
on
your
net
was
real
helpful
or
whatever
they
only
get
i
dont
like
what
that
user
is
doing
because
please
do
not
send
the
note
to
the
sysadmin
i
need
to
take
it
to
them
in
a
manner
that
has
at
least
a
chance
of
getting
through
in
my
files
here
are
hundreds
of
responses
from
people
saying
thanks
for
the
info
or
could
you
send
me
such
and
such
or
your
posts
are
very
interesting
keep
it
up
and
only
a
handfull
of
go
aways
but
i
guess
the
fact
that
i
have
decided
not
to
waste
my
time
trying
to
convince
ted
is
a
net
offensetm
of
such
magnitude
as
to
warrant
a
message
complaining
about
me
knock
knockmy
name
is
ted
and
and
this
is
mark
were
from
the
thought
police
seems
you
have
some
pretty
dangerous
ideas
here
and
were
here
to
confiscate
them
nwo
indeed
guess
i
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
come
up
with
a
new
plan
thanks
ted
and
mike
hope
you
are
happy
i
will
be
on
for
a
few
more
days
and
then
thats
all
folks
your
comments
and
support
are
requested
i
can
no
longer
post
to
news
i
ask
what
this
has
accomplished
is
there
some
benefit
from
making
alternative
views
simply
vanish
not
in
my
book
seems
the
easiest
way
to
win
an
argument
is
to
make
the
opposing
side
shut
up
images
of
waco
ah
but
alas
and
all
this
when
i
am
in
the
process
of
typing
in
a
letter
to
me
from
the
tax
collector
saying
that
a
lien
was
removed
due
to
a
letter
that
i
wrote
challenging
jurisdiction
oh
well
it
takes
time
to
come
up
with
the
info
requested
and
i
was
just
getting
started
it
should
be
noted
that
ted
frank
has
been
accused
publicly
over
times
of
being
an
nwo
supporter
and
has
never
made
an
statements
to
the
contrary
further
what
are
ted
franks
motivations
for
getting
me
axed
we
all
know
that
some
people
are
getting
paid
to
collect
info
on
people
on
the
net
that
are
of
interest
to
the
government
and
ted
sure
seems
to
have
a
personal
interest
in
debunking
me
hmmm
just
who
does
he
work
for
the
university
of
chicago
which
he
attends
is
well
known
as
one
of
the
biggest
nwo
supporters
and
finally
if
anyone
would
be
able
to
help
me
find
a
new
account
here
in
the
boulderdenver
area
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
i
am
in
the
process
of
installing
linux
and
so
will
be
able
to
do
uucp
or
maybe
a
tcip
connection
any
help
here
would
be
greatly
appreciated
since
i
am
longer
be
able
to
post
news
and
will
no
longer
have
email
very
soon
i
hope
that
anyone

editors
note
the
reason
for
posting
the
header
lines
from
the
bounced
messages
was
to
show
what
the
problem
was
and
hopefully
correct
it
ted
frank
its
inexcusable
to
post
lines
of
bounced
mail
headers
to
four
newsgroups
a
simple

would
have
been
sufficient
resolution
lazlo
yes
i
agree
but
our
policy
is
to
not
watch

someone
here
makes
we
generally
let
the
net
itself
take
care
of
inappropriate
postings
by
flaming
the
user
into
shape
which
i
assume
this
is
ment
to
be
we
cs
operations
dont
like
to
get
involved
in
this
stuff
unless
its
illegal
repetitive
posts
of
gifs
harassment
or
something
else
that
offends
the
community
in
general
my
suggestion
is
that
you
take
it
to
email
and
explain
what
a
post
for
bounces
should
look
like
or
tell
him
to

editors
note
obviously
ted
had
no
such
intention
of
doing
so
ted
frank
however
teel
should
have
mentioned
that
though
his
advice
is
legally
sound
if
you

you
will
