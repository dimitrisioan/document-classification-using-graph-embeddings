NOW
WHICH
IS
IT
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
COMDEMN
NATIONAL
MEDIA
THEN
TURN
AROUND
AND
USE
IT
TO
SUPPORT
SOME
POSITION
YOU
PRESENT
SEEMS
SOMEWHAT
CONTRADICTORY
DOESNT
IT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
CONTRADICTORY
ON
THE
BASIS
THAT
THE
QUALITY
OF
MEDIA
REPORTING
VARIES
GREATLY
BASED
ON
THE
SUBJECT
AT
HAND
THE
MEDIA
HAS
PROVEN
ITSELF
VERY
ACCURATE
IS
THE
AREAS
OF
PRESENTING
RAW
UNDISPUTED
DATA
ONE
GOOD
EXAMPLE
WOULD
BE
THE
WEATHER
PAGE
IN
WHICH
HIGH
AND
LOW
TEMPERATURES
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
DAY
FOR
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
LOCATIONS
ARE
POSTING
THERE
IS
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
TO
SHOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
IN
ERROR
I
BELIEVE
THIS
TRUE
WHEN
WE
SPEAK
OF
PHYSICAL
DATA
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
PURE
SCIENCE
BUT
WHEN
WE
SPEAK
OF
DATA
THAT
REVOLVE
AROUND
SOCIAL
SCIENCES
THEN
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFUL
THE
AMERICAN
MEDIA
HAS
FAILED
US
IN
ITS
ANALYSIS
OF
COMPLEX
EVENTS
HOWEVER
IM
SURE
THAT
WE
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
MANY
NEWS
STORIES
THAT
HAVE
LEFT
US
ANGRY
BECAUSE
SO
MANY
FACTS
HAVE
BEEN
OMMITTED
CASES
THAT
COME
TO
MIND
ARE
THE
INVASION
OF
PANAMA
THE
WAR
WITH
IRAQ
THE
DISASTER
IN
WACO
THE
ISSUES
SURROUNDING
THE
ACCEPTANCE
OF
GAYS
INTO
THE
MILITARY
THE
WAR
ON
DRUGS
AND
MANY
OTHERS
I
QUITE
AGREE
BUT
THESE
ARE
CASES
OR
NEWS
EVENTS
THAT
CONTAIN
POLITICS
SOCIAL
SCIENCE
INFORMATION
SOCIOLOGY
ETC
AND
AT
BEST
ARE
REFLECTIONS
OF
THE
GROUP
THAT
REPORTS
THEM
AS
YOU
HAVE
POINTED
OUT
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
REPORT
THAT
THE
TEMPERATURE
WAS
DEGREES
WHEN
IT
WAS
DEGREES
AND
HAVE
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
YOU
THE
STORY
THAT
YOU
BRING
TO
LIGHT
WAS
REGARDING
THE
NEW
SEX
SURVEY
WHILE
IM
SURE
THAT
DUE
TO
LAZYNESS
SOME
OF
THE
DATA
WAS
OMMITTED
FROM
THE
ARTICLE
I
WOULD
VENTURE
TO
GUESS
THAT
THE
DATA
THAT
WAS
PRESENTED
DID
NOT
DEVIATE
FROM
THE
SURVEY
I
DO
HOWEVER
THINK
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
FOLLY
TO
HAVE
BLIND
FAITH
IN
A
SINGLE
NEWSWRITERS
ANALYSIS
OF
THIS
DATA
IN
THIS
PARTICULAR
CASE
THERE
WAS
LITTLE
ANALYSIS
AND
THE
READER
WAS
LEFT
TO
DRAW
HISHER
OWN
CONVICTIONS
YES
AND
NO
THE
SURVEY
PRESENTED
ACCORDING
TO
MR
CRAMER
A
VALUE
CALLED
THE
MEDIAN
WHICH
ONE
USED
THIS
MAKES
US
BELIEVE
THAT
OF
THE
MALES
HAD
PLUS
SEX
PARTNERS
AND
OF
THE
MALES
HAD
OR
LESS
SEX
PARTNERS
HOMOSEXUALS
ARE
PURPORTED
TO
MAKE
UP
ONLY
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
PLUS
SEX
PARTNERS
ARE
HETEROSEXUAL
IT
IS
MY
FEELING
THAT
MEDIAN
WAS
NOT
THE
INTENDED
WORD
USAGE
BUT
IF
IT
IS
THEN
WE
HAVE
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
MR
CRAMER
CLAIMS
ABOUT
GAY
PROMISCUITY
HETERO
PROMISCUITY
MANY
NETTERS
MR
CRAMER
INCLUDED
OFTEN
FORGET
THAT
THE
AMERICAN
MEDIA
ARE
MERELY
A
NUMBER
OF
BUSINESSES
WHOS
PURPOSE
IN
LIFE
IS
TO
MAKE
MONEY
FOR
THEIR
OWNERS
AND
STOCKHOLDERS
REVENUES
COME
LARGELY
FROM
ADVERTISERS
WHO
MERELY
WANT
MAXIMUM
USEFUL
EXPOSURE
PER
DOLLAR
THE
MEDIA
IS
LIKE
FAST
FOOD
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
FOOD
OR
OF
THE
REPORTING
WILL
IMPROVE
ONLY
IF
THE
CUSTOMERS
DEMAND
AS
SUCH
OTHERWISE
IT
IS
BUSINESS
AS
USUAL
VERY
GOOD
THIS
IS
A
POINT
THAT
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
BRING
OUT
AND
AS
ANY
NETWORK
NEWS
PROGRAM
WILL
SHOW
YOU
IT
IS
TRUE
THE
NEWS
MEDIA
IS
A
BUSINESS
AND
AS
SUCH
BECOMES
SKEWED
BECAUSE
OF
WHERE
ITS
LOYALTIES
LIE
THERE
IS
AN
OLD
STATEMENT
BY
A
MAN
AND
I
CANNOT
REMEMBER
HIM
OR
HIS
STATMENT
EXACTLY
BUT
IT
WARNS
AGAINST
THE
MERGER
OF
BUSINESS
AND
NEWS
REPORTING
BECAUSE
OF
THE
OBVIOUS
CONSEQUENCES
WHAT
MASTER
IS
NEWS
GOING
TO
SERVE
IN
THE
END
THE
ADVERTISER
AND
THE
BIAS
OF
THE
