repressed

recent
studies
have
shown
that
the
number
of
men
who
have
engaged
in
homosexual
activities
in
the
last
decade
is
and
the
number
of
men
who
are
exclusively
homosexual
is
these
figures
are
much
less
than
those
that
came
from
earlier
studies
that
showed
that
homosexuality
among
men
is
a
lot
higher
so
what
can
we
deduce
from
these
figures
are
there
a
lot
less
male
homosexuals
than
there
used
to
be
or
are
men
perhaps
women
too
not
as
honest
as
they
used
to
be
about
there
sexuality
presumably
the
people
that
were
polled
in
you
mean
in
the
men
and
women
were
much
more
open
about
their
homosexuality
than
today
want
to
try
that
one
again
this
survey
were
assured
of
their
anonymnity
so
they
should
have
answered
the
questions
honestly
i
suppose
however
it
could
be
that
gays
feel
so
repressed
and
denigrated
by
society
that
they
didnt
feel
that
they
could
be
forthcoming
about
there
sexuality
in
something
like
a
survey
if
this
true
then
is
it
possible
that
there
is
a
lot
more
gays
out
there
than
we
are
led
to
believe
perhaps
if
americans
were
more
open
about
there
sexualityi
think
most
americans
arentthen
we
might
discover
that
there
are
really
quite
a
few
more
people
out
there
who
are
orientated
toward
the
same
sexmen
and
women
included
id
venture
a
guess
that
there
is
a
lot
of
people
out
there
who
have
considered
having
a
relationship
with
someone
of
the
same
sex
at
some
point
in
there
life
maybe
they
didnt
take
their
longings
seriously
but
this
doesnt
make
these
longings
any
less
valid
therefore
if
americans
werent
so
repressed
about
their
sexuality
in
generalas
i
believe
they
may
be
then
wed
see
a
lot
more
people
coming
out
of
the
closet
you
mean
ignore
study
after
study
so
that
we
can
continue
to
accept
a
study
kinseys
that
is
obviously
wrong
as
for
myself
im
a
heterosexual
and
ive
never
considered
having
sex
with
another
man
thats
just
the
way
i
ami
could
have
just
as
easily
of
been
gay
i
suppose
one
of
the
big
debates
about
homosexuality
is
whether
or
not
its
a
type
of
behavior
that
is
learned
or
if
one
is
just
born
that
way
imho
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
its
some
combination
of
the
two
based
on
what
besides
your
own
warm
fuzzy
feelings
heres
something
to
ponder
upon
have
any
of
you
gaybashers
out
there
ever
considered
that
homosexuals
probably
deem
their
sexual
orientation
as
being
a
state
of
affairs
that
is
just
as
much
an
intrinsic
and
natural
part
of
their
life
as
heterosexuals
do
about
their
own
sexuality
in
other
words
someone
who
is
truly
alcoholics
share
that
feeling
until
they
hit
bottom
gay
may
not
be
able
to
live
any
other
way
even
if
they
date
someone
of
the
opposite
sex
or
get
married
in
their
heart
they
are
still
a
homosexual
likewise
if
someone
who
is
truly
heterosexual
forms
a
relationship
with
someone
of
the
same
sex
then
they
are
still
a
heterosexual
even
though
outward
appearances
may
suggest
otherwise

unless
of
course
the
problem
is
that
homosexuality
is
a
form
of
mental
disorder
caused
by
childhood
sexual
abuse
as
a
number
of
recent
works
suggest
if
homosexuals
would
stop
using
the
government
to
impose
their
morality
on
others
antidiscrimination
laws
and
leave
our
children
alone
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
private
but
until
they
get
over
the
liberal
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
government
is
to
tell
peaceful
people
how
to
live
i
have
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
point
out
that
homosexuality
is
not
an
alternative
lifestyle
but
a
sickness
