HOW
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
COPS
PUTTING
THEIR
LIVES
ON
THE
LINE
DAY
IN
AND
DAY
OUT
WHO
ARE
AFRAID
AS
HELL
OF
A
LARGE
BLACK
GUY
THA
T
TOOK
A
LARGE
AMOUNT
OF
PUNISHMENT
AND
REFUSED
SUBMIT
IM
CURIOUS
WHY
YOU
THINK
THAT
PARTICULAR
ADJECTIVE
IS
IMPORTANT
BLACK
IS
A
DESCRIPTIVE
ADJECTIVE
THAT
DESCRIBES
MR
KING
FROM
MANY
OF
THE
NEWSPAPER
RADIO
AND
TV
NEWS
REPORTS
I
HAVE
SEEN
THIS
ADJECTIVE
IS
COMMONLY
IN
FRONT
OF
HIS
NAME
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANYONE
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THE
USE
OF
THIS
ADJECTIVE
WHEN
USED
IN
A
BENIGN
MANNER
I
DID
NOT
SAY
THAT
MR
KING
WAS
A
NO
GOOD
BLACK
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
MR
KING
AND
WOULD
NOT
MAKE
THIS
ASCERTIAN
WITHOUT
SOME
EVIDENCE
TO
THIS
EFFECT
I
USED
IT
PURELY
AS
A
DESCRIPTIVE
ADJECTIVE
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER
THAN
MANY
MOST
NEWS
PEOPLE
HAVE
USED
IT
IN
THE
PAST
NO
ONE
IS
QUESTIONING
WHETHER
MR
KING
IS
BLACK
THE
QUESTION
ARISES
WHETHER
KINGS
RACE
SHOULD
MAKE
POLICE
OFFICERS
AFRAID
AS
HELL
YOUR
STATEMENT
SEEMS
TO
IMPLY
THAT
COPS
SHOULD
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
STANDARD
FOR
LARGE
BLACK
GUYS
THAN
FOR
JUST
LARGE
GUYS
IN
GENERAL
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
NEVER
SAID
THEY
WERE
AFRAID
OF
KING
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
BLACK
IN
FACT
THE
OFFICERS
WERE
AFRAID
OF
KING
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
HE
DID
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
COLOR
OF
HIS
SKIN
IT
IS
YOU
MR
FRANK
THAT
READ
THE
PHRASE
LARGE
BLACK
MAN
AND
CRIED
RACISM
IN
A
TYPICAL
KNEEJERK
FASHION
WHEN
YOU
AND
OTHERS
I
SUSPECT
CAN
GET
PAST
THIS
PROBLEM
MAYBE
THE
REAL
PROBLEMS
IN
THIS
ISSUE
CAN
BE
DISCUSSED
THAT
TWO
POSTS
LATER
YOU
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
ANYONE
POINTED
OUT
YOUR
USE
OF
THE
ADJECTIVE
IS
ALMOST
AS
INFORMATIVE
AS
YOUR
ORIGINAL
USE
