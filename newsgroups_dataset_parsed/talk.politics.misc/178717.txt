WAIT
A
SECOND
YOURE
IGNORING
MAJOR
FACTS
HERE
THERE
WAS
NO
ATTEMPT
TO
SIMPLY
SERVE
A
WARRANT
THE
BATF
HAD
A
NOKNOCK
WARRANT
THE
INITIAL
FIREFIGHT
BEGAN
WHEN
THE
BATF
THREW
CONCUSSION
GRENADES
AT
THE
BUILDING
BATF
ADMITS
THIS
WHEN
DID
THE
BATF
SAY
THIS
EVERYTHING
IVE
SEEN
FROM
THE
BATF
FROM
THE
OFFICIAL
VERSION
TO
THE
DISSIDENT
STATEMENTS
OF
BATF
OFFICERS
WHO
CONDUCTED
THE
RAID
CLAIMS
THAT
THE
DAVIDIANS
WERE
SHOOTING
AT
THE
AGENTS
LONG
BEFORE
THEY
WERE
WITHIN
GRENADE
RANGE
WHAT
I
SAW
ON
TV
AND
WHAT
YOU
CLAIM
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
THE
DAVIDIANS
DID
NOT
START
SHOOTING
UNTIL
AFTER
THE
BATF
LOBBED
A
COUPLE
GENADES
IN
THE
WINDOWS
AND
STARTED
SHOOTING
THEMSELVES
ALSO
IF
THE
WARRANT
IS
SEALED
HOW
DO
WE
KNOW
IT
WAS
A
NOKNOCK
EASY
IF
YOU
SEE
FEDERAL
AGENTS
IN
BODY
ARMOR
WITH
SUB
MACHINE
GUNS
GOING
IN
THROUGHT
WINDOWS
THAT
IS
A
NOKNOCK
WARRANT
ALSO
SINCE
THE
VIDEOTAPE
SHOWS
THE
BATF
THROWING
GRENADES
BEFORE
THE
BDS
ETUNRED
FIRE
YOU
CAN
SAFELY
ASSUME
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
RING
THE
DOORBELL
PVASILION
PS
GET
RID
OF
THAT
BANDWIDTH
CLOGGING
