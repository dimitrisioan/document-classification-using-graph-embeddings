I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
LEGAL
PRECEDENT
DEFINES
A
HUMAN
BEING
IE
A
PERSON
WHOSE
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
THE
LAW
AS
SOMEONE
WITH
A
FUNCTIONING
BRAIN
NO
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
USE
LEGAL
PRECEDENT
YOU
SHOULD
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
MODEL
PENAL
CODE
ON
WHICH
MANY
STATES
BASE
THEIR
CRIMINAL
CODE
MY
APOLOGIES
IF
I
WAS
UNCLEAR
I
WAS
NOT
TRYING
TO
START
A
STATUTORY
DEBATE
SINCE
THERE
ARE
MANY
IN
SOME
CASES
CONFLICTING
STATUTES
ON
THE
BOOKS
I
WAS
MERELY
SUGGESTING
A
PARADIGM
THAT
MIGHT
MAKE
SENSE
FOR
A
PROCHOICER
IMHO
AND
I
WAS
POINTING
OUT
THAT
LEGAL
PRECEDENT
DEFINES
A
HUMAN
BEING
AS
REFERRING
ONLY
TO
THE
BORN
SO
YOUR
SUGGESTION
WAS
INCORRECT
IF
AT
SOME
POINT
AN
UNBORN
CHILD
IS
A
HUMAN
BEING
THE
PARENTS
CLEARLY
HAVE
THE
SAME
RESPONSIBILITIES
TOWARD
HER
AS
ANY
OTHER
PARENTS
HAVE
TOWARD
THEIR
CHILDREN
AND
NO
PARENT
CAN
BE
FORCED
TO
SUPPLY
BODILY
RESOURCES
TOWARD
THEIR
CHILDREN
EVEN
IF
NECESSARY
TO
SAVE
THE
CHILDS
LIFE
THERE
IS
A
CONFUSION
HERE
BETWEEN
ACTION
AND
INACTION
A
PARENT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
RUN
OUT
IN
FRONT
OF
A
BUS
TO
SAVE
THEIR
CHILDS
LIFE
EITHER
BUT
A
PARENT
IS
REQUIRED
TO
FEED
HIS
CHILDREN
THERE
IS
A
CONFUSION
HERE
ABOUT
WHAT
BODILY
RESOURCES
CONSTITUTES
BLOOD
TRANSFUSIONS
AND
ORGAN
DONATIONS
INVOLVE
BODILY
RESOURCES
YOUR
