PTOWNSONEECSNWUEDU
WRITES
SO
THE
JURY
WILL
BE
MAKING
ITS
ANNOUNCEMENT
AT
AM
SATURDAY
MORNING
PACIFIC
TIME
AM
EASTERN
TIME
WHY
SUCH
AN
UNGODLY
HOUR
I
GUESS
ITS
BECAUSE
THE
NEWS
IS
NOT
WHAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WANTED
TO
HEAR
EITHER
THE
POLICE
OFFICERS
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND
INNOCENT
OR
AFTER
A
WEEK
THE
JURY
IS
HUNG
NEITHER
GOOD
NEWS
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENTS
POINT
OF
VIEW
AS
THEY
DESPARATELY
NEEDED
SOME
SCAPEGOATS
IN
LOS
ANGELES
WRONG
ON
BOTH
ACCOUNTS
MAYBE
BY
MAKING
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
AT
AM
ON
THE
WEST
COAST
THEY
FIGURE
ALL
THE
RIOTERS
WILL
BE
ASLEEP
GIVING
THE
TROOPS
TIME
TO
MOVE
INTO
PLACE
NO
ONE
IS
A
RIOTER
UNTIL
THEY
PARTICIPATE
IN
A
RIOT
WHICH
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
HAPPEN
NOW
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
LA
ARE
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
GOTTEN
UP
EARLY
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
COURT
ANNOUNCEMENT
I
GUESS
WE
CAN
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
A
WEEKEND
OF
RIOTING
EH
SORRY
TO
DISAPPOINT
YOU
BUT
THIS
SEEMS
UNLIKELY
THE
MAYOR
OF
LOS
ANGELES
IN
A
PRESS
CONFERENCE
ABOUT
AM
SATURDAY
MORNING
IN
ANNOUNCING
THAT
THE
JURY
WOULD
GIVE
ITS
VERDICT
LATER
THIS
MORNING
JUST
AN
HOUR
AWAY
AS
I
WRITE
THIS
WOULD
NOT
SAY
WHAT
THAT
VERDICT
IS
BUT
I
THINK
HE
WAS
TOLD
IN
HIS
PRESS
CONFERENCE
HE
SAID
ANYONE
RIOTING
WILL
BE
STOPPED
DEAD
IN
THEIR
TRACKS
I
DONT
THINK
HE
WAS
TOLD
HOWEVER
HIS
STATEMENT
WAS
STILL
APPROPRIATE
MEANWHILE
FOLLOWING
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
OF
THE
JURYS
VERDICT
THE
JUDGE
JURY
AND
ASSORTED
COURT
PERSONNEL
WILL
BE
EVACUATED
FROM
THE
BUILDING
VIA
HELICOPTERS
LANDING
ON
THE
ROOF
OF
THE
COURTHOUSE
THEY
CANT
EVEN
WALK
OUT
THROUGH
THE
FRONT
DOOR
WITH
THEIR
HEADS
HELD
HIGH
JURY
DUTY
IS
A
SOLEMN
DUTY
TO
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
IT
IS
NOT
MEANT
TO
BE
A
SOURCE
OF
PRIDE
OR
INSTANT
FAME
WONT
THE
RIOTERS
HAVE
A
SURPRISE
WAITING
FOR
THEM
WHEN
THEY
WAKE
UP
LATER
TODAY
WELL
THE
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
GOT
UP
EARLY
TO
GO
TO
THE
COURT
TO
HEAR
THE
VERDICT
FOUND
THAT
JUSTICE
WAS
SERVED
GIVEN
YOUR
DIRE
AND
CYNICAL
PREDICTIONS
I
IMAGINE
THAT
IT
IS
YOU
WHO
WILL
BE
SURPRISED
