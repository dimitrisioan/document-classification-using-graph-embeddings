item
number
in
a
previous
posting
you
stated
that
you
had
found
overwhelming
support
for
child
molestation
in
socmotss
you
have
finally
responded
to
this
one
i
have
read
your
complete
file
of
postings
to
socmotss
and
to
put
it
bluntly
it
does
not
support
your
assertion
in
short
this
claim
is
bogus
thank
you
for
confirming
this
all
those
postings
in
defense
of
adults
having
sex
with
children
and
you
just
choose
to
claim
that
they
dont
say
anything
of
the
sort
theres
no
point
in
discussing
this
any
further
then
you
are
clearly
a
liar
without
morals
of
any
sort
prepared
to
justify
child
molestation
clayton
are
you
really
an
idiot
or
do
you
just
play
one
on
usenet
you
claimed
you
had
postings
from
a
dozen
ie
socmotss
posters
that
supported
child
molestation
point
aside
that
they
were
really
defending
abolishing
or
modifying
the
age
of
consent
laws
or
the
right
to
be
attracted
but
dont
act
upon
desires
for
children
so
out
of
thousands
is
an
overwhelming
majority
you
never
cease
to
amaze
me
and
you
still
havent
told
me
why
my
relationship
with
my
partner
is
immoral
