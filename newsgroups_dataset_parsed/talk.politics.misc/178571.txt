press
briefing
by
george
stephanopoulos
the
briefing
room
pm
edt
mr
stephanopoulos
good
afternoon
q
could
we
do
this
on
the
lawn
mr
stephanopoulos
that
would
be
nice
lets
go
out
to
the
cherry
blossoms
well
do
like
the
president
q
is
the
stimulus
package
dead
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
not
q
can
you
tell
us
more
about
the
dole
talks
you
said
it
was
a
good
visit
but
no
compromise
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
the
president
had
a
good
talk
with
senator
dole
last
night
i
think
that
as
we
said
before
there
were
no
specific
compromises
on
either
side
although
it
was
a
very
good
discussion
about
the
jobs
package
and
about
other
issues
as
well
as
you
know
the
president
first
called
senator
dole
i
believe
tuesday
night
to
talk
about
the
russian
aid
package
they
did
not
speak
senator
dole
called
him
back
wednesday
morning
when
the
president
was
out
instead
he
spoke
with
tony
lake
and
at
the
close
of
that
conversation
indicated
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
the
president
about
the
jobs
and
stimulus
package
they
finally
talked
about
that
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
close
of
that
discussion
they
said
that
they
would
have
another
talk
last
night
which
they
did
when
the
senator
was
up
in
new
hampshire
and
although
there
were
no
specific
compromises
made
on
either
side
they
did
say
that
they
would
continue
to
have
some
discussions
and
thats
where
we
are
q
well
who
is
giving
in
where
is
it
standing
are
both
making
concessions
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
its
at
that
phase
no
compromise
has
been
made
as
the
president
has
said
consistently
he
intends
to
come
forward
with
an
adjusted
package
he
believes
in
the
package
but
he
believes
that
if
its
going
to
take
adjustments
to
get
the
minority
to
release
it
hes
willing
to
make
those
adjustments
q
on
the
subject
of
a
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
boy
q
can
we
stay
on
this
for
one
more
minute
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
q
we
have
a
problem
with
the
five
minutes
q
i
know
no
decisions
have
been
made
but
what
would
lead
the
health
group
to
believe
that
a
vat
might
be
necessary
mr
stephanopoulos
sorry
andrea
im
not
going
to
go
down
that
road
no
decisions
have
been
made
as
the
president
said
this
morning
a
number
of
groups
a
number
of
members
of
congress
a
number
of
other
organizations
have
recommended
that
this
be
looked
at
the
working
group
is
looking
at
it
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
q
to
follow
have
they
done
that
directly
through
him
have
labor
and
business
groups
been
in
touch
with
the
president
about
it
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
although
theres
a
lot
of
people
who
have
public
decisions
in
support
of
the
vat
but
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
q
at
the
meetings
that
hes
had
with
his
own
task
force
advisers
have
they
discussed
the
funding
issue
and
what
the
possible
options
would
be
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
that
that
has
been
presented
for
a
decision
no
q
not
for
a
decision
but
has
it
been
discussed
as
an
option
mr
stephanopoulos
again
there
are
a
lot
of
levels
of
briefing
i
do
not
believe
that
the
vat
has
been
presented
to
the
president
as
okay
this
is
something
for
you
to
decide
on
q
youre
not
saying
he
didnt
know
it
was
being
considered
though
are
you
mr
stephanopoulos
no
he
said
its
being
considered
q
he
knew
that
q
but
has
he
discussed
that
with
his
advisers
thats
what
im
asking
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
said
its
being
considered
i
do
not
know
what
level
of
discussion
there
has
been
over
the
vat
it
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
i
dont
even
know
that
its
q
but
he
didnt
say
he
was
considering
did
he
at
this
stage
mr
stephanopoulos
no
he
is
not
i
think
were
getting
into
something
of
a
metaphysical
debate
right
here
what
is
considered
q
well
he
is
the
one
who
said
i
havent
reviewed
it
mr
stephanopoulos
that
is
true
that
is
what
i
just
repeated
q
george
is
there
any
concern
here
that
as
a
result
of
the
definite
statement
he
made
in
february
and
the
promise
that
if
it
were
to
be
considered
hed
let
us
know
and
having
it
trickle
out
the
way
it
did
that
there
may
now
be
the
development
of
a
credibility
gap
on
this
issue
and
others
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
so
i
mean
it
is
now
public
knowledge
that
this
is
being
considered
q
is
he
or
you
at
all
embarrassed
about
the
absolute
statements
that
were
made
from
this
platform
to
the
effect
that
it
was
off
the
table
and
was
not
being
considered
and
then
to
have
it
come
out
not
from
you
people
but
mr
stephanopoulos
well
wait
a
second
it
came
out
from
the
administration
what
are
you
talking
about
q
what
im
saying
is
though
that
the
president
said
he
would
let
us
know
mr
stephanopoulos
right
q
you
people
then
said
you
said
i
believe
that
its
not
going
to
be
on
the
program
mr
stephanopoulos
on
march
q
on
march
mr
stephanopoulos
circumstances
change
q
well
i
understand
but
we
have
to
find
that
out
by
rooting
around
in
the
fine
print
of
an
interview
mr
stephanopoulos
rooting
around
i
know
you
did
do
a
very
good
job
there
to
read
the
usa
today
article
but
this
is
laughter
the
deputy
director
of
the
omb
and
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
i
mean
that
is
common
anytime
you
guys
write
a
story
that
has
an
unattributed
quote
from
somebody
in
the
clinton
administration
the
headline
is
ill
look
at
it
right
here
and
ap
story
clinton
wants
more
money
for
spying
q
what
about
his
remark
that
if
it
were
being
considered
hed
tell
us
about
it
mr
stephanopoulos
and
the
administrations
concerned
and
hed
let
you
know
q
and
did
he
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
absolutely
what
did
he
say
this
morning
q
it
had
to
be
dragged
out
of
you
here
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
it
didnt
have
to
be
dragged
out
of
me
we
had
the
deputy
director
of
the
omb
we
had
the
secretary
of
health
of
human
services
say
it
was
being
considered
that
is
his
administration
that
is
his
administration
policy
q
were
these
authorized
trial
balloons
or
were
they
orchestrated
leaks
i
mean
what
was
the
mr
stephanopoulos
they
were
asked
questions
they
answered
the
questions
q
youre
saying
here
that
it
didnt
have
to
be
dragged
out
that
you
more
or
less
made
it
clear
yesterday
you
were
considering
it
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
i
was
very
clear
painfully
clear
q
was
there
a
particular
political
strategy
in
making
it
clear
the
administration
is
considering
a
new
tax
increase
on
tax
day
mr
stephanopoulos
no
it
was
just
this
issue
is
being
considered
they
were
asked
if
it
was
being
considered
they
answered
that
it
was
being
considered
q
george
the
new
york
times
q
why
do
it
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
they
were
asked
q
the
new
york
times
reports
today
that
secretary
reich
and
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
department
used
apples
and
oranges
numbers
in
order
to
portray
last
months
unemployment
figures
in
a
way
that
was
supportive
of
the
presidents
job
stimulus
bill
but
which
turned
out
to
be
totally
false
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
it
was
totally
false
but
i
think
laughter
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
department
did
grant
that
it
was
an
inappropriate
mixing
and
they
say
that
q
the
question
is
is
the
president
concerned
about
behavior
that
amounts
to
corrupting
government
data
and
whats
he
doing
about
it
if
so
mr
stephanopoulos
the
chief
economist
has
said
that
a
mistake
was
made
it
wont
happen
again
and
thats
the
end
of
the
matter
q
isnt
that
the
same
information
that
goes
to
the
president
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulus
package
mr
stephanopoulos
theres
two
separate
pieces
of
information
i
think
thats
where
the
confusion
was
q
when
did
you
all
first
learn
about
this
mistake
that
was
made
mr
stephanopoulos
i
read
the
article
this
morning
q
and
as
far
as
you
know
is
the
president
aware
of
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
so
q
and
was
he
aware
of
it
before
he
read
about
it
in
the
new
york
times
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
not
to
my
knowledge
q
did
you
ever
hear
about
it
before
this
morning
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
i
didnt
q
wasnt
the
president
given
an
erroneous
spin
on
this
for
his
own
purpose
for
his
speeches
for
his
arguments
mr
stephanopoulos
well
again
im
not
sure
both
statements
are
true
what
the
labor
department
has
granted
is
that
mixing
them
in
one
sentence
essentially
was
misleading
they
said
it
was
a
mistake
they
said
they
wouldnt
do
it
again
q
did
they
drop
it
is
this
something
that
you
choose
to
spin
or
make
an
issue
of
mr
stephanopoulos
whenever
fewer
people
are
out
of
work
were
gratified
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
need
to
get
this
jobs
package
going
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulus
package
for
a
minute
you
said
that
the
president
plans
to
come
forward
with
an
amendment
is
the
timetable
still
what
it
was
that
the
amendment
would
be
laid
down
on
monday
and
voted
on
on
tuesday
or
did
he
in
the
conversation
with
dole
talk
about
the
possibility
of
putting
that
off
for
a
few
more
days
to
give
more
time
for
the
discussion
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
at
this
point
theres
no
changes
in
the
schedule
at
all
i
dont
know
that
they
discussed
the
timing
like
that
q
do
you
believe
that
youre
closer
or
getting
closer
this
week
than
you
were
last
week
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
believe
that
were
going
to
pass
a
jobs
package
the
president
is
prepared
to
make
adjustments
in
order
to
get
that
to
happen
i
dont
know
where
the
votes
are
on
cloture
at
this
particular
time
i
dont
know
whats
going
to
happen
until
we
have
a
vote
but
the
president
believes
deeply
in
this
jobs
package
and
wants
to
get
it
done
q
has
there
been
any
indication
that
this
situation
has
changed
mr
stephanopoulos
were
going
to
continue
to
work
on
it
well
know
when
the
votes
are
taken
q
george
last
week
you
said
that
there
are
or
various
people
in
the
administration
were
saying
that
you
couldnt
go
through
dole
you
were
going
to
have
to
try
and
go
around
him
because
he
was
immovable
on
this
subject
of
a
compromise
or
at
least
the
compromise
he
wanted
was
not
anything
like
the
one
that
you
could
accept
this
week
youre
talking
to
him
is
that
because
youve
realized
that
the
peeling
off
effort
wasnt
going
to
work
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
because
senator
dole
wanted
to
talk
to
the
president
about
the
stimulus
package
q
he
initiated
the
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
secretary
reich
this
morning
said
that
in
fact
the
president
is
not
willing
to
compromise
on
this
bill
at
all
you
say
hes
making
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
thats
exactly
what
he
said
i
think
he
said
he
didnt
have
any
indication
that
there
was
any
compromises
yet
or
that
there
would
be
a
compromise
and
the
president
doesnt
want
to
compromise
and
the
president
doesnt
want
to
compromise
but
if
he
has
to
make
adjustments
to
get
it
through
he
will
q
officials
here
yesterday
said
that
panetta
was
working
on
a
series
of
adjustments
that
might
be
made
public
before
the
actual
vote
mr
stephanopoulos
its
possible
q
today
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
exactly
when
that
will
happen
but
i
think
that
its
very
possible
that
well
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
different
package
or
senate
democrats
will
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
different
package
in
order
to
get
it
passed
q
as
we
understood
his
conversations
with
dole
the
first
one
was
some
discussion
of
this
and
ill
get
back
to
you
tonight
with
some
details
or
some
adjustments
or
whatever
the
phrase
is
did
he
offer
him
some
details
or
some
adjustments
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
its
a
question
of
how
detailed
i
mean
i
think
they
had
a
general
discussion
about
the
package
last
night
subsequent
to
their
conversation
yesterday
afternoon
i
believe
that
there
will
be
followup
discussions
today
in
the
senate
not
necessarily
between
the
president
and
senator
dole
and
let
me
just
reiterate
neither
side
has
made
specific
compromises
at
this
date
when
we
have
something
well
let
you
know
and
im
not
suggesting
that
senator
dole
has
accepted
anything
that
weve
talked
about
or
that
weve
offered
anything
in
a
hard
way
q
what
are
the
followup
discussions
if
not
the
president
and
dole
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
senator
mitchell
is
going
to
talk
to
senator
dole
q
is
that
a
threat
laughter
q
did
the
president
say
to
senator
dole
all
right
how
about
this
number
as
an
overall
size
or
did
dole
say
to
the
president
i
can
go
as
high
as
this
did
they
talk
numbers
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
it
was
a
negotiation
in
that
respect
it
was
more
of
a
discussion
about
their
positions
q
did
they
discuss
actual
numbers
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
i
know
they
talked
about
the
basic
outlines
of
the
packages
i
think
they
talked
about
the
programs
they
cared
about
i
dont
know
if
they
got
to
the
level
of
this
many
xbillion
dollars
q
does
dole
have
to
sign
off
before
there
is
a
package
mr
stephanopoulos
no
of
course
not
q
did
the
white
house
have
anything
to
do
with
the
protesters
who
showed
up
in
new
hampshire
today
where
senator
dole
was
speaking
was
that
in
any
way
organized
by
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
no
q
and
has
the
president
been
in
touch
with
senators
kohl
or
feingold
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
hes
talked
to
them
no
q
george
is
the
president
considering
the
more
palatable
fact
of
having
a
national
sales
tax
instead
of
having
the
haves
having
to
continuously
pay
for
the
havenots
and
is
he
going
to
scrap
his
proposed
tax
on
the
privileged
few
with
the
haves
having
to
pay
for
the
havenots
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
deeply
that
the
tax
rates
on
upper
income
americans
as
he
presented
in
his
budget
should
go
up
and
i
think
for
the
second
half
of
your
question
ill
refer
you
to
my
briefing
from
yesterday
q
george
on
the
subject
of
accuracy
in
information
you
suggested
the
other
day
that
the
stimulus
package
included
money
that
would
solve
the
water
problem
in
milwaukee
apparently
that
is
not
true
its
actually
waste
water
money
mr
stephanopoulos
its
waste
water
money
for
wisconsin
and
some
could
go
to
milwaukee
q
but
it
would
not
affect
the
drinking
water
problem
because
its
waste
water
money
right
mr
stephanopoulos
it
would
affect
the
water
treatment
overall
q
but
the
implication
from
your
statement
the
other
day
was
that
it
would
help
fix
this
disease
problem
in
milwaukee
now
would
you
agree
thats
not
the
case
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
of
the
specifics
i
know
that
it
goes
to
the
overall
water
treatment
in
wisconsin
q
a
leftover
question
from
this
morning
which
was
when
did
the
president
find
out
that
the
task
force
was
deliberating
on
a
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
exactly
when
i
just
dont
know
i
assume
it
came
up
over
the
last
certainly
between
the
time
that
we
had
commented
on
in
the
past
and
two
days
ago
q
so
sometime
since
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
right
i
dont
know
the
exact
date
q
george
the
president
this
morning
mentioned
that
some
labor
and
business
groups
are
for
the
vat
tax
apparently
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
talks
about
perhaps
the
vat
tax
being
okay
if
it
replaces
the
btu
tax
so
does
the
president
feel
that
perhaps
this
might
be
in
place
of
some
other
tax
hes
proposed
or
is
this
totally
in
addition
to
the
other
taxes
hes
already
proposed
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
weve
said
all
we
have
to
say
about
the
vat
at
this
point
i
mean
theres
just
no
this
is
being
considered
by
the
health
care
working
groups
and
that
is
all
the
president
hasnt
made
any
further
decisions
beyond
that
q
but
it
would
be
to
finance
health
care
it
wouldnt
be
to
replace
some
other
tax
that
finances
it
wouldnt
replace
the
income
tax
for
instance
mr
stephanopoulos
there
have
been
no
discussions
on
that
q
in
terms
of
getting
a
vat
tax
through
congress
senator
doles
press
release
today
said
vat
on
tax
day
do
you
think
does
it
have
a
chance
of
getting
through
congress
would
it
have
a
chance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
have
no
idea
q
is
that
a
consideration
whether
you
all
put
it
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
that
would
become
a
consideration
if
the
president
were
to
decide
to
do
it
its
not
in
consideration
now
q
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
briefing
that
circumstances
had
changed
and
that
had
caused
the
vat
to
now
be
under
consideration
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
what
the
president
referred
to
this
morning
these
groups
came
forward
and
said
this
is
something
that
has
to
be
considered
q
those
are
the
circumstances
that
have
changed
thats
the
only
difference
between
now
and
when
he
emphatically
ruled
it
out
that
groups
have
asked
it
to
be
considered
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
what
he
said
q
is
that
true
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
was
there
in
fact
some
understanding
that
sin
taxes
would
not
produce
enough
money
for
the
health
care
benefits
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
deliberations
q
but
george
mr
stephanopoulos
no
what
the
consideration
is
as
the
president
said
groups
came
forward
and
said
this
is
something
you
ought
to
consider
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
q
is
that
the
only
thing
thats
changed
since
his
prior
statement
and
your
prior
statement
on
the
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
can
you
explain
how
those
groups
how
that
information
got
to
him
that
groups
wanted
it
was
it
just
reading
the
newspaper
or
did
groups
make
presentations
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
groups
as
you
know
the
health
care
task
force
has
met
with
dozens
of
groups
q
but
this
is
the
presidents
knowledge
that
these
groups
had
come
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
was
referring
to
what
was
coming
to
the
working
groups
obviously
there
have
also
been
published
positions
in
the
newspapers
q
have
certain
groups
briefed
him
on
the
groups
presentations
to
them
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyve
briefed
him
i
mean
how
detailed
the
briefings
have
been
i
know
that
the
working
groups
decided
to
look
into
this
after
being
pressed
by
these
groups
q
what
kind
of
arguments
did
the
groups
make
that
were
persuasive
enough
that
the
president
would
change
the
position
that
he
had
enunciated
previously
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
its
just
theyve
had
longstanding
positions
that
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
finance
health
care
q
the
president
wasnt
aware
of
those
longstanding
positions
mr
stephanopoulos
he
may
have
been
at
some
level
obviously
hes
been
a
governor
for
a
long
time
and
he
knows
the
basic
arguments
for
and
against
a
vat
tax
q
what
were
trying
to
figure
out
here
youre
telling
us
that
the
only
change
the
only
thing
that
affected
this
change
in
the
presidents
attitude
toward
the
vat
between
february
and
now
mr
stephanopoulos
the
presidents
attitude
hasnt
necessarily
changed
i
mean
he
has
not
made
a
decision
q
i
know
but
the
president
said
that
it
was
off
the
table
so
did
you
and
youre
saying
that
the
only
thing
thats
changed
is
the
positions
of
these
groups
except
youre
also
describing
them
as
longstanding
positions
i
dont
see
the
change
if
these
groups
havent
had
any
change
in
their
position
thats
been
made
to
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
well
theyve
made
the
presentations
to
the
health
care
task
force
q
theres
no
relationship
at
all
between
the
fact
that
sin
taxes
that
he
had
said
suggested
in
february
that
he
favored
will
not
produce
enough
revenue
to
finance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
he
ever
suggested
that
they
would
produce
all
the
revenue
q
well
he
suggested
that
he
thought
that
those
were
appropriate
ways
to
finance
health
care
mr
stephanopoulos
he
did
say
that
i
dont
know
that
he
said
anything
to
refute
that
q
but
in
fact
has
the
task
force
discovered
that
there
wouldnt
be
enough
revenue
from
those
taxes
to
finance
the
kind
of
core
benefits
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
think
that
the
task
force
ever
suggested
that
there
would
q
george
if
he
advocated
a
vat
tax
would
that
break
his
promise
not
to
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
to
pay
for
his
programs
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
comment
on
a
hypothetical
situation
q
but
does
that
promise
would
that
promise
not
to
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
to
pay
for
the
programs
prevent
him
from
seeking
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
made
no
decisions
on
the
vat
tax
when
he
does
well
tell
you
and
well
explain
the
implications
then
q
which
specific
groups
can
you
cite
business
labor
or
otherwise
whose
recommendations
to
the
health
care
task
force
has
prompted
this
consideration
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
have
the
specific
i
just
dont
have
that
q
george
can
you
tell
us
to
what
extend
these
other
alternatives
for
instance
the
employer
tax
or
the
sin
taxes
or
other
financing
options
are
also
still
on
the
table
and
what
these
options
are
mr
stephanopoulos
no
as
members
of
the
task
force
and
representatives
of
the
working
groups
have
said
they
are
looking
at
a
wide
variety
of
options
i
think
that
ira
magaziner
said
that
there
are
different
options
under
consideration
but
im
not
going
to
comment
q
whats
the
scope
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
going
to
comment
on
them
no
q
whats
the
scope
of
the
need
how
much
are
you
talking
about
that
has
to
be
produced
by
one
or
a
combination
of
the
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
what
the
health
care
task
force
is
looking
at
q
since
theres
not
going
to
be
any
briefing
on
the
miyazawa
visit
two
questions
one
generally
what
does
the
president
hope
to
use
that
meeting
for
but
more
specifically
is
his
task
complicated
by
the
japanese
anger
over
the
vancouver
note
and
the
remark
about
market
access
at
the
press
conference
mr
stephanopoulos
the
vancouver
note
q
does
no
mean
yes
q
yes
and
no
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
i
saw
the
prime
ministers
press
conference
where
he
was
asked
the
question
about
that
note
and
he
gave
a
very
gracious
and
complete
answer
when
he
was
asked
the
question
the
questions
of
trade
are
something
that
certainly
will
be
discussed
between
the
prime
minister
and
the
president
there
is
obviously
a
trade
imbalance
between
japan
and
the
us
that
we
want
to
do
something
about
q
also
in
those
comments
the
prime
minister
made
he
suggested
that
the
united
states
should
come
down
heavy
on
him
in
terms
of
trade
are
you
going
to
oblige
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
president
will
state
our
views
on
trade
very
clearly
and
our
views
on
the
trade
deficit
very
clearly
i
dont
necessarily
want
to
agree
with
your
characterization
of
the
prime
ministers
comments
q
that
we
need
specific
export
targets
specific
numerical
targets
is
that
what
hes
going
to
discuss
with
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
theyre
going
to
have
a
broad
discussion
of
a
wide
range
of
trade
issues
i
dont
want
to
get
into
those
specifics
until
after
the
meeting
q
why
q
thats
the
crux
of
the
issue
right
whether
or
not
does
the
president
believe
that
without
specific
numerical
targets
it
is
really
as
he
said
in
his
press
conference
sort
of
hopeless
that
this
is
going
to
change
very
much
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
we
must
have
pressure
on
japan
to
turn
the
trade
imbalance
around
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
specifics
of
how
that
would
be
done
q
but
does
the
president
believe
that
their
stimulus
package
announced
yesterday
will
rectify
the
imbalance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
first
the
president
wants
to
get
a
full
briefing
on
the
stimulus
package
from
prime
minister
miyazawa
himself
and
then
hell
make
the
comment
on
it
q
how
about
the
russian
aid
package
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
about
how
the
us
views
that
secretary
christopher
saying
or
bentsen
saying
the
japanese
may
need
to
do
more
the
japanese
saying
that
thats
not
what
they
heard
mr
stephanopoulos
again
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
all
our
allies
in
the
and
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
help
for
russian
reform
russian
democratic
reform
and
i
think
that
so
far
we
had
a
very
good
announcement
out
of
tokyo
and
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
our
allies
for
bilateral
packages
q
do
you
think
the
japanese
need
to
do
more
mr
stephanopoulos
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
all
our
allies
to
do
as
much
as
we
can
q
secretary
christopher
was
asked
today
on
the
today
show
this
morning
what
he
thought
of
margaret
thatchers
comments
on
the
bosnia
policy
and
he
said
its
a
rather
emotional
response
mr
stephanopoulos
over
an
emotional
issue
q
right
to
an
emotional
problem
does
the
white
house
condone
that
kind
of
remark
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
secretary
christophers
remarks
speaks
for
itself
the
president
believes
also
that
this
is
a
deeply
troubling
situation
that
were
trying
to
find
answers
for
q
but
that
specific
rather
emotional
response
specific
term
mr
stephanopoulos
no
it
speaks
for
itself
q
in
connection
with
that
doesnt
it
seem
that
with
the
numbers
of
people
who
are
being
killed
at
this
very
moment
is
it
good
american
policy
to
put
off
some
decisions
that
might
be
made
now
to
help
boris
yeltsin
win
a
referendum
mr
stephanopoulos
for
example
q
to
take
stronger
action
to
take
military
action
air
strikes
anything
that
can
be
done
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
what
must
be
done
now
is
to
push
harder
for
sanctions
he
is
also
as
you
know
the
administration
has
been
discussing
lifting
the
arms
embargo
he
believes
those
are
the
appropriate
ways
to
increase
pressure
at
this
time
q
what
is
your
response
to
the
critics
who
would
say
that
the
us
is
now
stymied
by
trying
to
help
boris
yeltsin
retain
the
presidency
mr
stephanopoulos
theyre
wrong
were
pressing
hard
for
the
serbs
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
were
pressing
hard
for
increased
sanctions
and
were
talking
to
our
allies
about
the
arms
embargo
q
you
were
putting
great
store
in
vance
and
owen
getting
people
to
agree
to
that
now
vance
and
owen
have
both
said
that
military
force
to
some
extent
would
be
acceptable
does
that
change
your
thinking
mr
stephanopoulos
clearly
were
going
to
listen
to
whatever
people
who
have
put
so
much
time
into
a
situation
have
to
say
but
at
this
point
the
president
is
moving
forward
on
sanctions
and
talking
about
the
arms
embargo
q
a
followup
on
a
dee
dee
comment
this
morning
she
said
she
would
be
able
to
provide
some
administration
officials
who
could
document
the
effect
the
sanctions
are
having
in
bosnia
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
or
do
you
have
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
thats
what
she
said
q
thats
exactly
what
she
said
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
thats
true
but
what
she
said
we
would
look
into
the
situation
of
what
kind
of
evidence
can
be
provided
in
bosnia
obviously
if
there
are
connections
between
the
bosnian
serbs
and
the
serbs
in
belgrade
and
we
are
tightening
the
screws
on
the
serbs
in
belgrade
that
will
have
an
effect
over
time
i
do
not
know
day
by
day
minute
by
minute
what
kind
of
help
is
being
given
between
the
two
and
what
the
exact
effect
has
been
but
clearly
we
are
slowing
the
shipment
of
goods
into
belgrade
we
are
having
an
effect
on
the
serbs
there
what
kind
of
effect
that
will
eventually
have
on
the
bosnian
serbs
i
dont
know
but
one
thing
i
would
say
is
if
it
were
having
no
effect
at
all
i
dont
know
why
theyd
be
fighting
it
so
much
q
are
the
first
ladys
tax
returns
going
to
be
released
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
a
joint
tax
return
and
it
will
be
probably
later
today
q
is
the
president
considering
signing
an
executive
order
banning
discrimination
against
homosexuals
in
the
federal
work
force
as
part
of
the
gay
rights
march
here
next
week
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
theres
any
proposal
for
that
at
this
time
not
that
i
know
of
q
its
something
that
the
president
promised
during
the
campaign
that
he
would
do
mr
stephanopoulos
i
have
not
seen
any
i
dont
think
its
anything
thats
on
his
plate
right
now
q
is
he
meeting
with
gay
rights
leaders
at
any
point
on
this
issue
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
on
this
issue
i
assume
that
hell
meet
with
representatives
of
the
gay
and
lesbian
community
sometime
soon
as
he
meets
with
representatives
of
lots
of
different
groups
and
communities
q
do
you
know
if
thats
scheduled
mr
stephanopoulos
its
probably
going
to
be
tomorrow
q
probably
going
to
be
tomorrow
laughter
q
its
a
good
thing
you
asked
q
whos
probably
going
to
be
there
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
q
how
long
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
thats
all
i
know
q
do
you
know
if
its
at
pm
tomorrow
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
what
time
it
is
i
dont
even
know
for
sure
if
its
going
to
be
tomorrow
q
environmental
groups
have
asked
him
to
make
a
major
speech
next
week
of
some
kind
is
that
going
to
happen
do
you
know
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyve
asked
but
i
think
the
president
has
always
planned
as
he
did
last
year
to
give
a
speech
on
earth
day
and
i
expect
that
he
will
if
its
not
exactly
on
earth
day
it
might
be
a
day
before
or
something
like
that
q
is
he
planning
to
sign
or
announce
the
signing
of
the
biodiversity
treaty
in
connection
with
earth
day
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
the
specific
timing
of
something
like
that
but
its
certainly
something
under
discussion
and
something
weve
been
working
on
q
campaign
finance
reform
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
it
q
do
you
think
it
will
be
next
week
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
the
biodiversity
treaty
is
something
youre
working
on
i
missed
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
something
were
working
on
he
asked
if
it
was
ready
to
be
signed
and
i
said
i
didnt
know
anything
about
that
but
its
something
weve
certainly
been
working
on
q
do
you
know
what
organizations
might
be
represented
in
this
meeting
with
the
gay
and
lesbian
groups
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
q
do
you
know
if
he
is
going
to
reconsider
being
out
of
town
on
the
day
of
the
march
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
got
to
be
at
the
senate
meeting
in
jamestown
and
i
believe
hes
also
going
to
be
giving
a
speech
to
the
american
association
of
newspaper
publishers
in
boston
on
sunday
as
he
did
last
year
q
would
you
have
told
us
if
she
had
not
pressed
you
on
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
on
what
q
on
the
gays
mr
stephanopoulos
when
we
went
through
the
presidents
schedule
for
the
day
certainly
q
george
what
day
is
the
publishers
speech
is
that
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
its
a
sunday
q
and
saturday
hell
be
in
jamestown
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
so
youre
just
going
to
be
in
jamestown
for
one
day
mr
stephanopoulos
no
im
not
sure
i
dont
know
how
long
the
senate
thing
goes
it
might
go
overnight
i
just
dont
know
q
you
would
have
made
the
gay
meeting
public
right
mr
stephanopoulos
im
certain
if
we
had
the
meeting
i
dont
know
about
open
to
the
press
but
we
would
have
told
you
about
it
q
i
mean
because
it
is
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
first
time
in
history
a
president
has
met
in
the
oval
office
with
mr
stephanopoulos
i
didnt
say
it
was
going
to
be
in
the
oval
office
laughter
but
i
didnt
im
not
say
that
its
not
but
i
didnt
say
that
it
was
laughter
q
at
the
white
house
in
the
bush
administration
gay
officials
were
invited
to
a
bill
signing
ceremony
and
the
white
house
had
to
repudiate
having
done
that
so
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
president
wouldnt
do
anything
like
that
q
certainly
not
q
what
marching
orders
did
the
president
give
to
general
vessey
mr
stephanopoulos
they
had
a
very
good
discussion
for
about
half
an
hour
today
he
wanted
the
most
important
thing
was
he
had
a
full
accounting
for
american
pows
and
mias
he
will
obviously
look
into
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
new
document
the
president
stressed
that
he
wanted
the
fullest
possible
accounting
and
said
that
only
when
we
have
that
can
we
even
consider
any
changes
in
our
policy
towards
vietnam
hell
be
looking
at
vietnams
response
to
the
questions
raised
by
the
document
and
hell
also
look
into
investigations
on
discrepancy
cases
increased
efforts
on
remains
implementing
trilateral
investigations
and
access
to
military
archives
and
ambassador
toon
also
briefed
the
president
on
the
activities
of
the
joint
commission
and
on
the
document
q
vietnam
says
its
a
fake
what
is
the
dod
analysis
at
this
stage
mr
stephanopoulos
its
not
completed
yet
and
its
also
the
first
thing
that
general
vessey
will
bring
up
with
the
vietnamese
q
a
number
of
defense
officials
have
been
saying
that
they
think
that
the
or
so
prisoners
referred
to
are
in
fact
nonamericans
that
the
vietnamese
had
captured
who
they
referred
to
as
americans
from
time
to
time
do
people
mr
stephanopoulos
we
dont
have
any
final
determination
were
going
to
wait
for
the
complete
review
when
we
have
it
well
make
a
judgment
q
i
know
you
dont
have
any
final
determination
but
given
all
of
the
intense
public
interest
in
this
do
you
think
that
thats
a
likely
possibility
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
want
to
characterize
it
in
any
way
until
the
review
is
complete
q
george
was
there
a
topic
scheduled
for
the
speech
in
boston
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
is
the
president
going
to
have
a
press
conference
tomorrow
with
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
so
but
im
not
positive
yes
i
expect
yes
q
was
toon
in
with
vessey
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
he
was
in
on
the
meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
what
was
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
was
ambassador
toon
in
with
vessey
and
the
answer
is
yes
q
do
you
have
any
response
to
the
wall
street
journal
report
this
morning
the
presidents
distressed
about
some
of
his
press
clippings
and
that
perhaps
hes
distressed
with
you
about
that
mr
stephanopoulos
no
well
i
do
have
a
response
i
think
the
article
was
highly
misleading
to
the
extent
that
it
implied
that
the
president
has
had
restricted
access
to
the
press
i
would
point
out
that
hes
answered
questions
on
occasions
more
than
any
of
his
predecessors
i
would
also
point
out
it
also
q
how
many
questions
mr
stephanopoulos
three
hundred
fiftyeight
on
occasions
q
how
many
were
while
he
was
jogging
mr
stephanopoulos
well
no
thats
actually
a
very
good
question
andrea
and
i
would
point
out
further
that
the
article
also
implied
that
these
questions
were
only
answered
at
tightly
controlled
photo
opportunities
which
is
just
patently
false
hes
had
press
conferences
in
either
the
east
room
the
oval
office
or
the
roosevelt
room
or
the
briefing
room
in
addition
to
questions
taken
at
photo
opportunities
and
that
is
only
the
q
oval
office
press
conference
when
was
that
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
answered
questions
in
the
east
room
hes
had
five
in
the
east
room
hes
had
one
in
the
oval
office
hes
had
one
in
the
rose
garden
hes
had
one
or
two
in
the
roosevelt
room
and
this
is
just
to
the
white
house
washington
press
corps
in
addition
to
that
hes
had
interviews
with
local
television
anchors
hes
met
with
the
editorial
board
of
the
portland
oregonian
hes
had
an
hourlong
interview
with
dan
rather
hes
had
interviews
with
local
press
from
california
florida
and
connecticut
q
can
you
address
the
question
of
the
attitude
the
article
implies
that
he
doesnt
q
why
doesnt
he
like
us
laughter
q
did
you
really
get
blamed
for
that
post
story
q
the
story
is
that
you
are
you
held
responsible
for
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
im
going
to
comment
about
this
q
are
you
denying
that
the
president
has
shown
displeasure
publicly
mr
stephanopoulos
i
am
not
commenting
on
the
discussions
between
the
president
and
myself
q
did
the
president
write
that
letter
to
chris
webber
mr
stephanopoulos
what
q
the
letter
to
the
university
of
michigan
basketball
player
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
yes
q
that
is
an
authentic
letter
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
since
the
president
first
talked
about
the
vat
in
february
he
said
at
the
time
that
he
thought
there
probably
should
be
exceptions
made
in
basic
necessities
such
as
food
and
clothing
does
he
still
hold
that
position
given
the
impact
it
could
have
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
just
cant
comment
on
a
proposal
he
hasnt
made
q
george
does
the
president
have
some
agenda
for
this
meeting
with
the
gay
leaders
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
it
will
just
a
general
meeting
on
the
wide
range
of
issues
that
they
care
about
including
aids
and
other
issues
civil
rights
q
the
military
issue
mr
stephanopoulos
im
certain
it
will
come
up
q
is
he
using
this
event
to
name
the
aids
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
so
q
george
what
specifically
is
the
president
doing
to
prepare
for
tomorrows
meeting
with
the
prime
minister
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
had
briefing
memos
hes
had
general
discussions
with
members
of
the
treasury
department
the
trade
representative
and
others
q
report
yet
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
he
has
the
report
referred
to
in
the
times
but
ambassador
kantor
was
here
to
brief
him
today
q
he
was
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
does
he
intend
to
use
any
of
these
instances
that
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
that
the
reports
been
presented
but
obviously
the
president
will
press
hard
in
any
case
where
he
thinks
that
a
violation
has
occurred
q
in
terms
of
the
wall
street
journal
the
thrust
was
that
theres
a
real
schism
here
a
hostility
do
you
think
he
feels
that
way
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
as
i
said
on
the
record
in
the
article
i
think
the
president
likes
reporters
again
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
article
was
still
misleading
the
thrust
of
the
article
was
that
in
some
way
some
attitude
which
the
president
may
or
may
not
have
is
affecting
access
when
in
fact
he
has
the
most
open
accessible
administration
than
have
any
in
recent
history
q
can
we
come
up
to
your
office
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
if
youre
invited
the
press
thank
you
