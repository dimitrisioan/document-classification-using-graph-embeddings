a

points
out
according
to
jerry
taylor
catos
director
of

resource
studies
we
are
not
running
out
of
sources
of
energy
the
world
now
has
almost
times
the
proven
oil
reserves
it
had
in
and
twice
the
reserves
of
proven
reserves
of
coal

natural

increased

as
dramatically

standards
of

united
states
is
no
less
energy
efficient
than
japan
and
more
energy
efficient
than
many
of
the
group
of
seven
nations
energy
independence
provides
little
protection
against
domestic
oil
price
shocks
because
the
energy
economy
is
global
moreover
since
the
cost
of
oil
represents
only
about
percent
of
gross
national
product
even
large
increases
in
the
price
of
oil
would
