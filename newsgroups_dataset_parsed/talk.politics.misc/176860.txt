once
pointed
out
that
curious
fact
are
you
saying
that
it
should
be
considered
unpatriotic
if
you
do
not
give
everything
you
own
to
the
state
are
you
saying
that
it
should
be
considered
unpatriotic
if
you
do
not
give
your
life
in
battle
for
the
state
the
pc
patrioticly
correct
certainly
think
so
i
thought
that
kind
of
system
collapsed
when
the
soviet
union
did
no
the
pentagon
is
still
standing
and
collecting
names
for
the
draft
if
thats
not
what
you
meant
at
what
point
does
paying
more
taxes
cease
being
patriotic
your
money
or
your
life
which
is
more
important
nice
dodge
i
give
it
a
now
to
answer
your
questions
i
do
not
believe
that
there
should
be
a
draft
the
armed
services
should
be
voluntary
can
you
say
the
same
about
taxes
ive
answered
your
question
would
you
now
answer
mine
mob
rule
isnt
any
prettier
merely
because
the
mob
calls
itself
a
government
it
aint
charity
if
you
are
using
someone
elses
money
wilsons
theory
of
relativity
if
you
go
back
far
enough
were
all
