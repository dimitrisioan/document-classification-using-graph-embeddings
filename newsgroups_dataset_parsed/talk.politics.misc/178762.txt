PHILL
HALLAMBAKER
WRITES
IN
ORDER
TO
REJECT
THE
WORD
OF
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
IT
IS
NECCESSARY
TO
BELEIVE
THE
WORDS
OF
A
MAN
WHO
HAS
JUST
MURDERED
CHILDREN
AND
ORDERED
THE
SUICIDEMURDER
OF
HIS
OTHER
FOLLOWERS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
ACCOUNT
GIVEN
THE
BATF
ATTEMPTED
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
UPON
KORESH
AT
THE
RANCH
AND
WERE
MET
BY
GUNFIRE
IN
A
DELIBERATE
ATTEMPT
TO
MURDER
THEM
THE
KORESHGUN
SUPPORTER
CLAIM
THAT
THE
BATF
STARTED
SHOOTING
SIMPLY
DOES
NOT
STAND
UP
IF
THE
AFT
HAD
GONE
THERE
TO
START
SHOOTING
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
WITH
HEAVIER
GRADE
WEAPONRY
THAN
STANDARD
ISSUE
HANDGUNS
FOR
ALL
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
THEY
WERE
UNARMED
THE
BD
FOLLOWERS
HAD
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
WANT
GUN
CONTROL
MUST
OBVIOUSLY
DISCOUNT
THE
ENTIRE
GOVERNMENT
STORY
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
RATIONALISATION
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
TO
SIMPLY
DISMISS
THE
GOVERNMENT
AS
INCOMPETENT
THAT
WOULD
REQUIRE
THEM
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
SOLUTION
THEMSELVES
INSTEAD
THEY
HAVE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
GOVERNMENT
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
WHEREBY
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECIDED
TO
SET
OUT
TO
MURDER
PEOPLE
JUST
TO
SET
UP
SOME
SORT
OF
SCARE
TO
ALOW
THEM
TO
GET
GUN
CONTROL
LEGISLATION
THROUGH
I
MUST
OBJECT
TO
THE
CHARACTERIZATION
OF
THOSE
OPPOSED
TO
THE
GOVERNMENTS
HANDLING
OF
THE
WACO
SITUATION
AS
GUN
SUPPORTERS
YOUR
ARGUMENT
TRIES
TO
PAINT
THE
BATF
CRITICS
AS
RIGHTWING
GUN
NUTS
AND
JUST
MIXES
UP
TWO
ISSUES
I
AM
ONE
OF
THE
BATFFBI
CRITICS
AND
YET
I
AM
A
LIBERAL
AND
JUST
AS
ANTIGUN
AS
YOU
ARE
I
JUST
HAPPEN
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
EVERYONE
HAS
CIVIL
RIGHTS
EVEN
RELIGIOUS
CRAZIES
THEYRE
ALL
HUMAN
BEINGS
NOT
SOME
NEST
OF
WASPS
THAT
YOURE
TRYING
TO
EXTERMINATE
THE
BATF
CREATED
THE
CRISIS
SITUATION
BY
THE
WAY
THEY
HANDLED
THE
ORIGINAL
RAID
IT
WAS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
KORESH
REGULARLY
WENT
JOGGING
OUTSIDE
HIS
PROPERTY
HE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
SERVED
WITH
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
THEN
HE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
ARRESTED
IF
HE
HAD
REFUSED
TO
COMPLY
INSTEAD
OFFICERS
ARMED
WITH
GRENADES
INVADED
THE
PROPERTY
THIS
ESCALATED
INTO
A
SHOOTING
WAR
WITH
TRAGIC
DEATHS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
THOSE
WERE
THE
FIRST
TWO
MISTAKES
THE
BAD
JUDGMENT
OF
ASKING
FOR
A
NOKNOCK
WARRANT
AND
THE
BAD
AND
PROBABLY
ILLEGAL
WAY
THE
ALREADYUNWISE
WARRANT
WAS
SERVED
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
SITUATION
ESCALATED
TO
WHERE
IT
WAS
DESCRIBED
AS
AN
ARMED
STANDOFF
AND
A
HOSTAGE
CRISIS
THATS
WHEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
STARTED
COVERING
THEIR
TRACES
SEALING
THE
WARRANT
REVISING
THEIR
REPORTED
HISTORY
OF
THE
INCIDENT
ETC
THINGS
WERE
ALREADY
BUILDING
UP
TO
DISASTER
NOW
THE
GOVERNMENT
COULD
HAVE
SIMPLY
CLOSED
THE
SUPPLY
ROUTES
AND
WAITED
BUT
ACCORDING
TO
JANET
RENO
THAT
OPTION
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERED
SO
SUPPOSEDLY
BECAUSE
THE
AGENTS
WERE
FRUSTRATED
AND
FATIGUED
AND
BECAUSE
THERE
SUPPOSEDLY
WERE
NO
BACKUPS
THEY
FELT
THEY
HAD
TO
GO
IN
YES
THE
GOVT
HANDLED
IT
IN
THE
RAMBO
HOLLYWOOD
TYPE
STYLE
WITH
EXTREEME
MACHISMO
PERHAPS
THATS
NOT
THE
WAY
TO
HANDLE
IT
IT
IS
A
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
THING
TO
START
ASSERTING
AS
MANY
HAVE
DONE
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
PRIMARILY
TO
BLAME
THE
COMPARISONS
WITH
THE
NAZIS
IN
PARTICULAR
ARE
PURELY
GRATUITOUS
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
PROVIDED
A
CONSTRUCTIVE
OPINION
ON
THE
ISSUE
YOUR
POST
DESREVES
TO
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
PETER
NELSON
ALSO
MADE
SOME
VERY
GOOD
POINTS
ABOUT
HOW
A
LOW
KEY
APPROACH
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
EFFECTIVE
THE
POINT
IS
THOUGH
THAT
YOU
LEARN
THROUGH
MISTAKES
THE
GOVT
PLAYED
THE
WRONG
CARD
AND
LOST
THATS
NOT
A
BIG
DEAL
THEY
HAD
HAD
FOUR
GUYS
MURDERED
AT
THE
BEGINING
AND
MAYBEE
THEY
JUST
WERE
NOT
PREPARED
FOR
WUITE
THIS
SITUATION
WHO
COULD
BE
IF
THE
SAME
THING
WERE
TO
HAPPEN
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
WE
MIGHT
PERHAPS
BE
ABLE
TO
CASTIGATE
THE
GOVT
IF
THEY
USED
THE
SAME
TACTICS
AND
FAILED
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
AS
IT
IS
I
CANT
SAY
THAT
I
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
MADE
THE
SAME
MISTAKE
MAYBEE
I
WOULDNT
BECAUSE
I
DONT
AS
A
RULE
GO
IN
FOR
A
CONFRONTATIONAL
SITUATION
IF
I
CAN
AVOID
IT
MAYBEE
I
WOULD
BECAUSE
WITH
ALL
THOSE
PRESS
ABOUT
ITS
VERY
DIFFICULT
NOT
TO
TRY
THE
MACHO
STUFF
THE
FBI
HAD
INFORMATION
FROM
WITHIN
THE
COMPOUND
WE
HAD
NO
ACCESS
TO
THEY
MAY
HAVE
CALCULATED
THAT
THE
BD
FOLLOWERS
RESOLVE
WAS
CRACKING
BASED
ON
THEIR
LISTENING
DEVICES
WITHIN
THE
COMPOUND
THEY
KNEW
THAT
KORESH
HAD
CHICKENED
OUT
OF
ONE
SUICIDE
ATTEMPT
THIS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
REASON
WHY
THEY
CONSIDERED
THAT
FEAR
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
A
WEAPON
FOR
BREAKING
HIS
RESOLVE
AGAIN
IN
PANAMA
THEY
HAD
USED
THE
HEAVY
ROCK
MUSIC
TO
GREAT
EFFECT
DURING
BUSHS
INVASION
FUNNY
THAT
FEW
OF
THE
KORESH
SUPPORTERS
AND
APPOLOGISTS
COMPLAIN
MUCH
ABOUT
THE
DEATH
OF
SEVERAL
THOUSAND
PANANMANIAN
CIVILIANS
WHILE
THE
US
GOVT
ATTEMPTED
TO
ARREST
THEIR
FORMER
ALLY
AND
PLEASE
LETS
NOT
TURN
THIS
INTO
A
PROGUN
VS
ANTIGUN
DISCUSSION
ANTIGUN
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
GUNOWNERS
DESERVE
TO
GET
FRONTALLY
ASSAULTED
BY
ARMED
GOVERNMENT
AGENTS
AND
KORESHS
CIVIL
RIGHTS
EXIST
WHETHER
HIS
GUNS
WERE
LEGAL
ILLEGAL
ILLEGALBUTSHOULDHAVEBEENLEGAL
OR
WHATEVER
KORESH
NEGATED
HIS
CIVIL
RIGHTS
THE
MINUTE
HIS
FOLLOWERS
FIRED
ON
THE
POLICE
HELICOPTER
NO
MATTER
WHETHER
THE
WARRANT
WAS
OR
WAS
NOT
TECHNICALLY
VALID
THE
GUYS
WHO
WERE
CARRYING
IT
OUT
THOUGHT
THAT
IT
WAS
THUS
THE
ASSAULT
ON
THEM
WAS
COMPLETELY
INEXCUSABLE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
RATIONALISATION
PEOPLE
MIGHT
WISH
TO
EMPLOY
OF
COURSE
WE
HAVE
TO
CONSIDER
THE
GUNS
ISSUE
THAT
IS
THE
WHOLE
CORE
OF
THE
QUESTION
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IS
A
DIVERSION
