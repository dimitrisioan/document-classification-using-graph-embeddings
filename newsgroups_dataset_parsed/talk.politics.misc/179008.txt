BLUE

HEALTH

OOPS
OOPS
BLUE
CROSS
MAY
WELL
BE
THE
INSURER
FOR
GOVERNMENT
WORKERS
IN
MASSACHUSETTS
AS
IT
IS
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
STATE
AND
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
BLUE
CROSS
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
A
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
IT
IS
A
PRIVATE
INSURER
YES
IT
IS
A
PRIVATE
INSURER
THAT
HAS
TO
DEAL
WITH
GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS
CONCERNING
HOW
ITS
EMPLOYEES
ARE
TO
BE
COVERED
PROCESSED
ETC
THERE
ARE
A
MOUNTAIN
OF
FORMS
THAT
GOV
EMPLOYEES
HAVE
TO
GO
THROUGH
SORRY
BUT
THIS
IS
A
RED
HERRING
ARE
YOU
CONTENDING
THAT
THE
MOUNTAIN
OF
FORMS
ARE
PROCESSED
BY
BLUE
CROSS
HAVING
HAD
BLUE
CROSS
INSURANCE
BOTH
AS
A
GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEE
AND
AS
AN
EMPLOYEE
OF
A
PRIVATE
CORPORATION
I
SAW
NO
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
SETS
OF
FORMS
MOREOVER
THE
ADMINISTRATIVE
COSTS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
MEDICAREMEDICAID
THE
TWO
PRIMARY
FORMS
OF
GOVERNMENT
INSURANCE
ARE
CONSIDERABLY
LOWER
THAN
THE
AVERAGE
FOR
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
VERSUS
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
BLUE
CROSS
BEARS
A
HEAVIER
BURDEN
IN
INSURING
GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEES
THAN
PRIVATE
EMPLOYEES
POST
IT
OTHERWISE
TRY
TO
STICK
TO
FACTUAL
ASSERTIONS
AND
AS
THE
ORIGINAL
POST
IMPLIED
IT
IS
PRIVATE
INSURERS
IN
THE
US
WHOSE
ADMINISTRATIVE
COSTS
ARE
SIGNIFICANTLY
HIGHER
THAN
THE
ADMINISTRATIVE
COSTS
OF
TAXSUPPORTED
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEMS
IN
CANADA
AND
ELSEWHERE
ONLY
THOSE
THAT
REMAIN
PAPERBOUND
AND
REFUSE
TO
STANDARDIZE
WELL
NOW
THATS
AN
INTERESTING
DEFENSE
OF
THE
FREE
ENTERPRISE
SYSTEM
ARE
YOU
CONTENDING
THAT
IT
IS
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
THAT
PREVENTS
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
FROM
STANDARDIZING
IN
FACT
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
REDTAPE
BURDEN
STEMS
FROM
THE
LACK
OF
STANDARDIZATION
AMONG
THE
OR
SO
PRIVATE
INSURERS
IN
THE
US
BUT
ITS
A
LITTLE
DIFFICULT
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THIS
IS
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
FREE
ENTERPRISE
AT
WORK
BY
THE
WAY
BARRONS
THE
BIBLE
OF
WALL
STREET
THIS
WEEK
ADMITTED
THAT
ADMINISTRATIVE
COSTS
WERE
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
IN
CANADA
BECAUSE
A
SINGLEPAYER
SYSTEM
IS
ALWAYS
CHEAPER
GUESS
EVEN
THE
FREE
ENTERPRISE
ADVOCATES
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
SEE
THE
LIGHT
TRY
AGAIN
WHY
MY
HMO
PROVIDES
GOOD
SERVICE
AT
A
LOW
COST
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TELLING
MY
DOCTORS
WHAT
THEY
CAN
AND
CAN
NOT
SAY
ABOUT

YOU
