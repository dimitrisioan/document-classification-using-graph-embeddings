THANK
YOU
FOR
PLAYING
BUT
OBVIOUSLY
YOU
ARE
NOT
READING
THE
MATERIAL
AS
IT
IS
PRESENTED
ACCORDING
TO
THE
REPORT
IVE
GOT
IN
MY
HANDS
THE
NEWSWEEK
ARTICLE
WHICH
REPORTED
THAT
TO
PERCENT
OF
THE
POPULATION
IS
GAY
USED
THE
CRITERIA
OF
NO
HETEROSEXUAL
CONTACT
IN
THE
PAST
YEAR
BUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
DENVER
STUDY
POINTS
OUT
QUITE
DRAMATICALLY
THAT
OF
ALL
SELFIDENTIFYING
GAY
MEN
HAVE
HAD
SOME
FORM
OF
HETEROSEXUAL
CONTACT
IN
THE
PAST
YEAR
I
THINK
THE
BIG
MISTAKE
IN
THAT
STUDY
MUST
BE
THAT
IF
ONE
HAD
HAD
NO
SEXUAL
CONTACT
OF
ANY
KIND
IN
THE
PREVIOUS
YEAR
THEY
ARE
COUNTED
AS
HETEROSEXUAL
EVEN
IF
THEY
DIDNT
INTEND
IT
THAT
WAY
THATS
HOW
THE
FIGURES
ARE
BEING
USED
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
POST
SOME
DATE
SUCH
AS
WHAT
QUESTONNARES
WHERE
USED
AND
HOW
THEY
WERE
DISTRIBUTED
AND
RETURNED
