WILLIAM

WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
SAID
IM
FOR
CREATING
A
CLASS
OF
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUGS
WHICH
WOULD
INCLUDE
THE
CURRENTLY
ILLEGAL
ONES
WHICH
WOULD
BE
LEGAL
TO
POSSESS
GROW
PRODUCE
BUT
NOT
TO
SELL
BOMB
THE
PUSHERS
BACK
TO
THE
BARTER
AGE
AND
TAX
PRODUCTION
TOO
UM
WHY
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
THE
ACT
OF
SELLING
RECREATIONAL
DRUGS
EVEN
FOR
MERCENARY
REASONS
EG
GETTING
RICH
NOTE
BY
SELLING
I
MEAN
SELLING
THE
PRODUCT
TO
A
CONSENTING
ADULT
AT
A
MUTUALLY
AGREEABLE
PRICE
I
POINT
THIS
OUT
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
PREEMPTIVELY
PREVENT
THIS
THREAD
FROM
GETTING
SIDETRACKED
ONTO
A
FLAMEFEST
ABOUT
PUSHING
DRUGS
TO
SCHOOLCHILDREN
OR
THE
LIKE
AND
WHY
SHOULD
THE

BE

WILLIAM

NOTE
THIS
IS
A
REPOST
OF
MY
EARLIER
RESPONSE
TO
MR

WHICH
WAS
NOT
PROPERLY
FORMATTED
APOLOGIES
TO
THOSE
WHOVE
SEEN
THE
FOLLOWING
BEFORE
TO
EXPLAIN
MY
POSITION
ON
THE
WAR
ON
DRUGS
I
OFFER
THIS
DRUGS
AND
CRIME
A
NEW
APPROACH
BY
KEN
BARNES
GIVEN
THAT
THE
TRADE
IN
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
MUCH
OF
THE
CRIME
WHICH
AFFLICTS
OUR
NATION
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
DRUGS
PARTICULARLY
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
PREDISPOSED
TO
ADDICTION
WILL
FIND
A
WAY
TO
GET
THEM
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
ARE
LEGALLY
AVAILABLE
DESPITE
CURRENT
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
EFFORTS
DRUGS
ARE
READILY
AVAILABLE
TO
THOSE
WHO
WANT
THEM
ADDICTION
TO
DRUGS
BOTH
LEGAL
AND
ILLEGAL
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
A
SIGNIFICANT
DRAIN
ON
THE
PRODUCTIVE
RESOURCES
OF
OUR
COUNTRY
AND
THIS
OCCURS
IN
A
VARIETY
OF
WAYS
FROM
THE
COCAINEADDICTED
BABIES
WHO
ARE
UNABLE
TO
LEARN
TO
THE
SPREAD
OF
DISEASE
AMONG
ADDICTS
TO
THE
TRAGIC
CONSEQUENCES
OF
ALCOHOL
ABUSE
AND
TOBACCO
SMOKING
A
GENERAL
ECONOMIC
PRINCIPLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
IS
THAT
WHATEVER
IS
SUBSIDIZED
YOU
GET
MORE
OF
AND
WHATEVER
IS
TAXED
YOU
GET
LESS
OF
TO
BE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
IN
CONFRONTING
THE
NATIONS
DRUG
PROBLEM
SOME
WAY
MUST
BE
FOUND
TO
UTILIZE
THESE
ADDITIONAL
POWERS
OF
GOVERNMENT
TO
MAKE
DRUG
DEALING
AND
DRUG
USE
LESS
ATTRACTIVE
WHILE
THIS
COUNTRYS
CURRENT
EFFORTS
TO
COMBAT
LEGAL
DRUGS
HAVE
SUCCEEDED
IN
SOME
RESPECTS
THERE
IS
A
GREATER
AWARENESS
OF
THE

CONSEQUENCES
OF

AND

PROGRAMS
HAVE
HELPED
REDUCE
DRUNK
DRIVING
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
SAME
CANNOT
BE
SAID
FOR
THE
WAR
ON
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
THERE
REMAINS
A
CORE
GROUP
OF
ILLEGAL
DRUG
USERS
WHICH
SUPPORT
INTERNATIONAL
NETWORKS
OF
SMUGGLERS
PUSHERS
GROWERS
PROCESSORS
KINGPINS
AND
GANGSTERS
THESE
NETWORKS
AND
THEIR
MARKETING
ACTIVITIES
WHICH
INCLUDE
DRIVE
BY
SHOOTINGS
CORRUPTING
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AUTHORITIES
AND
SMUGGLING
WEAPONS
ARE
DIRECTLY
OR
INDIRECTLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
A
LARGE
PROPORTION
OF
THE
CRIMES
COMMITTED
IN
OUR
COUNTRY
EVERY
DAY
CLEARLY
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
AND
RISING
CRIME
ARE
LINKED
IT
TAKES
ONLY
A
MOMENTS
REFLECTION
TO
RECOGNIZE
HOW
THEY
ARE
LINKED
THE
LINK
IS
MONEY
AS
WITH
THIS
COUNTRYS
FAILED
EFFORT
TO
PROHIBIT
ALCOHOL
CONSUMPTION
A
BLACK
MARKET
HAS
BEEN
CREATED
IN
WHICH
GREEDY
LOCAL
MONOPOLIES
LIKE
THE
GANGSTERS
OF
A
BYGONE
ERA
HAVE
PROFITED
ENORMOUSLY
FROM
THEIR
ILLEGAL
TRADE
THE
VICTIMS
OF
THIS
TRADE
INCLUDE
NOT
ONLY
THE
INNOCENT
PEOPLE
UNFORTUNATE
ENOUGH
TO
BE
CAUGHT
IN
THE
CROSSFIRE
BUT
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THE
DRUG
USERS
THEMSELVES
WERE
IT
NOT
FOR
THE
BLACK

AND
THE
VIOLENT
MONOPOLY
OF
THE

LORDS
DRUG

MIGHT
NOT
BE
THE
THIEVES
ROBBERS
PROSTITUTES
AND
MURDERERS
THEY
HAVE
BECOME
IN
ORDER
TO

THE
HIGH
PRICES
THE
DRUG

DEMAND
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
THE

MOST
WOULD
BE
I
BELIEVE
SIMPLY
PEOPLE
WITH
A
PROBLEM
EITHER
A
MORAL
PROBLEMORA
MEDICAL
PROBLEM
BUTNOTA
CRIMINAL
PROBLEM
LET
ME
BE
CLEAR
HOWEVER
I
AMNOTADVOCATING
THAT
WE
LET
THE
CRIMINALS
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
PREYING
ON
OUR
SOCIETY
FOR
THESE
MANY
YEARS
OF
PROHIBITION
OFF
THE
HOOK
ON
THE
CONTRARY
THE
NEW
APPROACH
I
ADVOCATE
IS
ONE
WHICH
WOULD
NOT
RESULT
IN
EITHER
THE
GOVERNMENT
OR
PRIVATE
INDUSTRY
GETTING
INTO
THE
BUSINESS
OF
PROMOTING
CRACK
COCAINE
OR
ANY
OTHER
PRESENTLY
ILLEGAL
DRUG
FOR
THAT
MATTER
NEITHER
IS
IT
AN
APPROACH
WHICH
SEES
LAW
ABIDING
CITIZENS
HANDING
OVER
MORE
AND
MORE
OF
THEIR
FREEDOM
AND
PRIVACY
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
TRACK
DOWN
ILLEGAL
DRUG
USERS
UNTIL
THE
LAND
OF
THE
FREE
AND
THE
HOME
OF
THE
BRAVE
LOOKS
LIKE
A
POLICE
STATE
HERE
THEN
IS
MY
PROPOSAL
POSSESSION
AND
USE
OF
ALL
PRESENTLY
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
IS
DECRIMINALIZED
BUT
BUYING
AND
SELLING
THEM
REMAINS
ILLEGAL
POTHEADS
CAN
GROW
THEIR
OWN
MARIJUANA
AS
MANY
ALREADY
DO
TODAY
OTHER
DRUG
USERS
CAN
LEGALLY
IMPORT
THEIR
POISON
OF
CHOICE
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
PAY
THE
TARIFFS
AND
A
BARTER
ECONOMY
OF
DRUG
EXPERIMENTERS
DEVELOPS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BARTER
ECONOMY
WHICH
SUPPLIES
THE
DRUG
USERS
THE
BLACK
MARKET
PROFITS
THAT
HAVE
SO
ENRICHED
THE
DRUG
LORDS
DWINDLE
IF
THESE
DRUGS
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
FOR
FREE
OR
NEXT
TO
NOTHING
WHY
BUY
THEM
NEVERTHELESS
THERE
WILL
BE
THOSE
WHO
WILL
SEEK
TO
SELL
THESE
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUGS
EVEN
AT
RELATIVELY
LOW
PRICES
THEREFORE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
ACTIVITY
IS
CONCENTRATED
ON
THOSE
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
CONTINUE
TO
BUY
AND
SELL
AND
ALSO
ON
THE
CRIMES
COMMITTED
BY
DRUG
USERS
TOO
POOR
TO
AFFORD
EVEN
LOW
PRICES
BUT
HERE
IS
WHERE
THE
STRATEGY
BEGINS
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN
THE
DRUG
DEALERS
THE
VICTIMIZERS
AND
THE
DRUG
USERS
THEIR
VICTIMS
UPON
ARREST
FORANYCRIMESUSPECTS
ARE
PERMITTED
TO
CHOOSE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
WILL
UNDERGO
A
DRUG
TEST
THOSE
WHO
CHOOSE
TO
COOPERATE
ARE
INFORMED
THAT
UPON
CONVICTION
FOR
THE
CRIME
THEY
ARE
ACCUSED
OF
IF
THEY
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
A
DRUG
USER
THEY
WILL
BE
INSTITUTIONALIZED
UNTIL
THEY
ARE
CLEAN
AND
ONLY
THEN
WILL
THEY
BEGIN
TO
SERVE
THEIR
SENTENCE
IF
THEY
CHOOSE
TO
COOPERATE
AND
ARE
ALREADY
DRUGFREE
THEY
CAN
BEGIN
TO
SERVE
THEIR
SENTENCE
RIGHT
AWAY
THOSE
WHO
CHOOSE
NOT
TO
UNDERGO
THE
DRUG
TEST
AND
ARE
CONVICTED
FACE
STIFFER
FINES
AND
SERVE
LONGER
SENTENCES
INSTITUTIONALIZATION
OF
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
SERVES
SEVERAL
PURPOSES
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
AND
THIS
INCLUDES
DRUNK
ANDOR
STONED
DRIVERS
ARE
SEPARATED
FROM
THEIR
SOURCES
OF
SUPPLY
THUS
REDUCING
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
DRUG
USERS
IN
SOCIETY
AT
LARGE
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
DECREASING
THE
DEMAND
FOR
DRUGS
ON
THE
STREET
PUTTING
MORE
OF
THE
REMAINING
DRUG
DEALERS
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
INSTITUTIONALIZATION
PROVIDES
AN
INCENTIVE
FOR
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
TO
STRAIGHTEN
THEMSELVES
OUT
BEFORE
BECOMING
PART
OF
THE
GENERAL
PRISON
POPULATION
WHILE
HELPING
PROTECT
SOCIETY
FROM
CRIME
INSTITUTIONALIZATION
COULD
ALSO
SERVE
TO
DETER
DRUG
USERS
FROM
BECOMING
CRIMINALS
SINCE
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
UNLIKE
OTHER
CRIMINALS
WOULD
BE
DELAYED
PRIOR
TO
SERVING
THEIR
SENTENCES
BY
THE
ADDITIONAL
TIME
IT
TAKES
FOR
THEM
TO
SOBER
UP
INSTITUTIONALIZATION
OF
DRUG
USING
CRIMINALS
SEPARATE
FROM
THE
GENERAL
PRISON
POPULATION
WOULD
ALSO
PROVIDE
A
CLOSELY
MONITORED
POOL
OF
ADDICTS
WHO
COULD
VOLUNTEER
FOR
RESEARCH
STUDIES
OF
NEW
TECHNIQUES
AND
TREATMENTS
FOR
ADDICTIVE
DISEASE
WITH
THE
POTENTIAL
TO
BENEFIT
BOTH
THEMSELVES
AND
OTHERS
DEALERS
IN
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
ARE
GENERALLY
NOT
DRUG
USERS
THEMSELVES
AND
THIS
IS
PARTICULARLY
TRUE
OF
THE
DRUG
BOSSES
OR
KINGPINS
RUNNING
LARGE
ILLICIT
ORGANIZATIONS
UNDER
THIS
PROPOSAL
DEALERS
WOULD
BE
MORE
READILY
IDENTIFIABLE
SINCE
UPON
ARREST
THEY
WOULD
PRESUMABLY
PASS
THE
DRUG
TEST
OR
ELSE
DECLINE
TO
TAKE
IT
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
HAVING
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
THEY
ARE
IN
POSSESSION
OF
DRUGS
WHEN
IT
IS
APPARENT
THEY
DO
NOT
USE
THEM
DECLINING
TO
TAKE
THE
TEST
THEY
WOULD
OF
COURSE
FACE
STIFFER
PENALTIES
WHILE
EACH
CASE
OF
ATTEMPTED
SALE
OF
A
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUG
WOULD
HAVE
TO
STAND
ON
OWN
ITS
MERITS
THE
OUTCOME
OF
A
SUSPECTS
DRUG
TEST
COULD
PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
PROSECUTION
JUST
AS
CIGARETTE
TAXES
HAVE
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
DECLINE
OF
SMOKING
IN
OUR
COUNTRY
BY
MAKING
CIGARETTES
MORE
COSTLY
WHILE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
PROVIDING
REVENUE
FOR
ANTISMOKING
CAMPAIGNS
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUGS
SHOULD
BE
TAXED
AND
THE
MONEY
GENERATED
SHOULD
BE
USED
TO
COMBAT
THEIR
USE
ENFORCEMENT
OF
THIS
TAX
SHOULD
BE
ON
A
VOLUNTARY
BASIS
HOWEVER
AND
SHOULD
NOT
BE
USED
AS
AN
EXCUSE
TO
INFRINGE
ON
THE
RIGHTS
AND
PRIVACY
OF
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUG
USERS
SINCE
TO
DO
SO
WOULD
HAVE
THE
EFFECT
OF
REINTRODUCING
PROHIBITION
INSTEAD
DRUG
USERS
WILL
BE
ENCOURAGED
TO
PAY
THE
TAX
BY
REMINDING
THEM
THAT
IF
UNTAXED
DRUGS
ARE
EVER
FOUND
IN
THEIR
POSSESSION
DURING
THE
COURSE
OF
ROUTINE
POLICE
OPERATIONS
THEY
WILL
BE
REQUIRED
TO
PAY
THE
TAX
IMMEDIATELY
OR
ELSE
FORFEIT
THEIR
UNTAXED
DRUGS
TO
BE
DESTROYED
IF
DRUG
DEALERS
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
SELLING
NONCOMMERCIAL
DRUGS
ON
WHICH
TAXES
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
PAID
THEY
WILL
FACE
ADDITIONAL
PROSECUTION
FOR
EVADING
THE
TAX
THE
STRATEGY
OF
ADDING
TAX
EVASION
TO
DRUG
DEALING
CHARGES
IS
ALREADY
IN
USE
IN
SOME
JURISDICTIONS
BUT
ITS
EFFECTIVENESS
IS
CURRENTLY
LIMITED
BY
THE
ILLEGALITY
OF
DRUG
POSSESSION
REVENUE
FROM
DRUG
POSSESSION
TAXES
AND
IMPORT
TARIFFS
WOULD
BE
USED
TO
FUND

TO

DRUG

FOR
THOSE
UNABLE
TO
AFFORD

TAXPAYER
SUBSIDIES
TO
ALL

BE
ENDED
FEDERAL
SUPPORT
OF
TOBACCO
FARMING
IS
BOTH
IMMORAL
AND
WASTEFUL
IN
THIS
ERA
OF
TIGHT
BUDGETS
AND
THE
MARIJUANA
CROPS
GROWN
ILLICITLY
ON
FEDERAL
LANDS
IN
MANY
STATES
MUST
LIKEWISE
BE
ELIMINATED
WHILE
MY
PROPOSAL
WOULD
HAVE
THE
EFFECT
OF
PERMITTING
THE
USE
OF
WHAT
ARE
NOW
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
IT
WOULD
HOLD
THE
USERS
OF
ALL
DRUGS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
ACTIONS
AND
I
BELIEVE
WOULD
REDUCE
THE
HARM
DRUGS
HAVE
ON
OUR
SOCIETY
PARTICULARLY
THE
CRIME
CAUSED
BY
THE
ILLEGAL
DRUG
TRADE
SO
LONG
AS
WE
REMAIN
A
FREE
NATION
WITH
RELATIVELY
POROUS
BORDERS
AND
FREEDOM
FOR
OUR
CITIZENS
TO
TRAVEL
WE
WILL
ALWAYS
HAVE
A
DRUG
PROBLEM
WHETHER
IT
TAKES
THE
FORM
OF
HEROIN
ADDICTS
DYING
IN
ABANDONED
BUILDINGS
DRUNK
DRIVERS
KILLING
AND
MAIMING
OTHERS
ON
OUR
STREETS
OR
EMPHYSEMA
PATIENTS
STRUGGLING
FOR
BREATH
AFTER
A
LIFETIME
OF
SMOKING
THE
RESULTS
ARE
THE
SAME
NEEDLESS
SUFFERING
AND
DEATH
AS
A
SOCIETY
WE
MUST
RECOGNIZE
THAT
WHILE
OUR
SOCIETY
PERMITS
US
TO
HARM
OURSELVES
WITH
DRUGS
AS
WE
ARE
ALREADY
DOING
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
DRUG
LAWS
WE
MUST
TAKE
A
STAND
AGAINST
THE
HARM
THAT
DRUGS
AND
DRUG
USERS
CAUSE
TO
OTHERS
WE
MUST
PARTICULARLY
OPPOSE
THE
VICIOUS
AND
VIOLENT
CARTELS
WHICH
PREY
ON
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
DRUG
USERS
BY
TAKING
THE
PROFITS
OUT
OF
THEIR
DEADLY
TRADE
MY
PROPOSAL
GOES
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARDS
SHUTTING
DOWN
THESE
POWERFUL
CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
DRUG
USE
IS
A
MORAL
OR
MEDICAL
PROBLEM
DEPENDS
ON
WHICH
GROUP
OF
DRUG
USERS
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
DIFFERENT
DRUGS
HAVE
DIFFERENT
EFFECTS
AND
SOME
ARE
MORE
ADDICTIVE
THAN
OTHERS
THE
ADDICTIVENESS
OF
A
DRUG
ALSO
OFTEN
VARIES
BETWEEN
INDIVIDUALS
AND
SO
WE
HAVE
SOME
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
DRINK
ALCOHOL
IN
MODERATION
WHILE
OTHERS
FIND
THEY
CANNOT
RESIST
THE
BOTTLE
NICOTINE
WHICH
FORMER

C
EVERETT
KOOP
DECLARED
TO
BE
AS
ADDICTING
AS
HEROIN
IS

DRUG
WITH
KNOWN
HARMFUL
EFFECTS
AND
WHILE
SOME
PEOPLE
CAN
STOP
SMOKING
BY
WILLPOWER
ALONE
OTHERS
CONTINUE
TO
SMOKE
EVEN
AFTER
TREATMENT
FOR
LUNG
CANCER
FOR
THOSE
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
CAN
STOP
TAKING
DRUGS
ON
THEIR
OWN
WE
MAY
ARGUE
THAT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
CHOSEN
TO
USE
THEM
THIS
REPRESENTS
A
MORAL
FAILURE
ON
THEIR
PART
OR
AN
UNWILLINGNESS
TO
FACE
THE
DIFFICULTIES
OF
LIFE
BUT
FOR
THE
ADDICTS
WHILE
THEY
MAY
HAVE
CHOSEN
TO
USE
DRUGS
THE
FIRST
TIME
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
DISCOVER
THEIR
ADDICTION
IT
IS
TOO
LATE
WE
CANNOT
HOLD
THEM
RESPONSIBLE

MORE

WE

WHO
IS
DROWNING
FOR
AN
INABILITY
