TM
TRY
IT
WHICH
YOU
REFER
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
MANY
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
EVOLVED
FROM
BASIC
PRAGMATIC
PRINCIPLES
OF
DAYTODAY
LIVING
IF
WE
HAD
LIVED
CERTAINLY
MANY
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
SEEM
TO
BE
POSITIVE
PRINCIPLES
FOR
EVERYDAY
LIVING
INDEED
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
THE
ISLAMIC
RELIGION
WHICH
AVOIDS
ALCOHOL
I
APOLOGIZE
IF
I
NAME
THE
WRONG
RELIGION
AND
THAT
IS
CERTAINLY
A
PHYSICAL
POSITIVE
IN
MANY
RESPECTS
HOWEVER
THIS
PROVES
NOTHING
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
IS
A
BASIC
PRAGMATIC
PRINCIPLE
OF
DAYTODAY
LIVING
TODAY
DOESNT
MEAN
IT
EVOLVED
FROM
THE
SAME
ESPECIALLY
THOSE
BELIEFS
AND
MOSTLY
POSITIONS
HELD
BASED
ON
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
RELIGION
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
COME
FROM
MANY
PLACES
BUT
MOST
WILL
BE
BACKED
UP
AFTER
MANY
LEVELS
OF
ARGUMENTS
TO
BECAUSE
THATS
HOW
IT
IS
WRITTEN
OR
GOD
SAYS
NOW
IM
NOT
FAULTING
THAT
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
A
BASIC
PRAGMATIC
PRINCIPLE
AS
YOU
MEAN
IT
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
IT
IS
A
BELIEF
BASED
ON
FAITH
WHICH
BY
DEFINITION
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
BACKED
UP
BY
LOGIC
FAITH
IS
A
GIVEN
GOD
IS
A
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
WHEN
ARGUING
FROM
RELIGION
ALSO
MANY
RELIGIONS
WOULD
REJECT
YOUR
THESIS
THAT
THEIR
BELIEFS
SIMPLY
COME
FROM
THESE
DAYTODAY
PRINCIPLES
IN
SUMMATION
IF
YOU
WISH
TO
USE
RELIGIOUS
ARGUMENTS
BE
PREPARED
TO
BACK
THEM
UP
WITH
IT
SAYS
IN
THE
FILL
IN
RELIGIOUS
DOCUMENT
HERE
BECAUSE
MOST
RELIGIONS
THINGS
WHICH
AT
LEAST
I
DENOTE
AS
RELIGIONS
ARE
BASED
ON
THE
WRITINGS
OF
OR
TEACHINGS
OF
FILL
IN
RELIGIOUS
FIGURE
HERE
NOTE
RELIGION
IS
A
CHARGED
TOPIC
AND
IF
I
OFFENDED
ANYONE
REGARDING
MY
REFERENCES
TO
GOD
I
APOLOGIZE
PLEASE
INSERT
YOUR
OWN
SENSIBLE
REFERENCES
