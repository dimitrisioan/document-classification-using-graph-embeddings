so
what
so
this
bolsters
the
contention
that
many
homosexuals
are
liars
so
if
this
study
is
proved
wrong
then
it
proves
that
heterosexuals
are
liars
unlike
the
propaganda
spouted
by
the
far
right
the
ten
percent
figure
was
backed
up
by
the
best
study
available
at
the
time
its
hardly
certain
that
this
new
study
is
correct
since
it
hasnt
even
been
out
for
enough
time
for
any
double
checking
to
happen
the
alan
guttmacher
institute
btw
is
funded
by
planned
parenthood
so
it
hardly
qualifies
as
a
bastion
of
conservatism
or
of
family
values
of
course
if
they
had
found
then
it
would
be
invalid
because
it
was
funded
by
planned
parenthood
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
this
preassumes
that
million
queers
will
show
up
on
april
there
wont
be
anywhere
near
that
many
go
ahead
make
my
day
promote
that
number
that
way
it
will
surely
be
a
much
greater
embarrassment
and
slap
in
the
face
to
homosexual
activists
when
the
crowds
are
much
smaller
even
if
its
only
one
million
the
point
still
stands
even
getting
of
a
given
population
in
one
place
would
be
unprecidented
if
even
million
show
up
in
dc
it
will
raise
serious
doubts
about
this
study
or
indicate
a
resolve
unprecidented
in
human
history
btw
have
you
noticed
that
even
slick
willie
isnt
going
to
be
in
town
that
day
he
isnt
the
target
of
the
march
nor
do
presidents
often
speak
at
civil
rights
marchs
of
course
it
would
have
been
nice
however
the
republicans
and
conservative
democrats
would
do
well
to
take
notice
join
the
pythagorean
reform
church
repent
of
your
evil
irrational
numbers
and
bean
eating
ways
accept
into
your
heart
call
the
pythagorean
reform
church
bbs
at
the
above
smacks
of
antihispanic
bigotry
this
is
quite
amusing
obviously
you
know
nothing
about
the
history
of
math
