PROHIBITS

LINE

WOMAN
CENTER
FOR
CHOICE
EVEN
ACROSS
THE
STREET
THEY
MAY
NOT
DISPLAY
PICTURES
OF
DEAD
FETUSES
OR
SING
OR
CHANT
LOUD
ENOUGH
TO
BE
HEARD
BY
PATIENTS
INSIDE
THE
CLINIC
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
JUSTICE
WILLIAM
O
DOUGLAS
WHO
WAS
ABOUT
AS
LIBERTARIAN
AS
YOU
CAN
GET
ABOUT
FREESPEECH
AND
SIMILAR
ISSUES
WROTE
A
MAJORITY
OPINION
IN
WHICH
THE
SUPREME
COURT
TURNED
DOWN
AN
APPEAL
BY
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
PROHIBITED
FROM
DEMONSTRATING
IN
FRONT
OF
THEIR
LANDLORDS
HOME
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
CITE
FOR
THE
CASE
YOU
DONT
GIVE
ENOUGH
INFORMATION
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
COMPARE
THE
TWO
SITUATIONS
IF
THE
DEMONSTRATORS
HAD
BEEN
BLARING
LOUD
ROCK
MUSIC
INTO
THE
LANDLORDS
HOME
ALL
DAY
AND
NIGHT
THEN
I
COULD
SEE
HOW
THE
OPINION
WOULD
BE
JUSTIFIED
BUT
THIS
COURT
ORDER
HAD
PROHIBITED
ABORTION
PROTESTERS
FROM
DISPLAYING
PICTURES
OF
DEAD
FETUSES
WHICH
DOESNT
DISRUPT
THE
PRIVACY
OF
ANYONE
INSIDE
THE
CLINIC
HE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
BE
FREE
FROM
SPEECH
PERHAPS
IN
THE
PRIVACY
OF
THEIR
HOMES
BUT
NOT
ON
PUBLIC
PROPERTY
DID
THE
KOREAN
GROCERY
STORE
OWNER
IN
NEW
YORK
CITY
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
BE
FREE
FROM
THE
SPEECH
OF
THE
PROTESTERS
OUTSIDE
HIS
STORE
PATRONS
INSIDE
THE
STORE
COULD
HEAR
THE
PROTESTERS
ASKING
THEM
TO
RECONSIDER
SHOPPING
THERE
HOW
IS
THAT
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
ABORTION
PROTESTERS
ASKING
WOMEN
TO
RECONSIDER
GETTING
AN
ABORTION
AT
A
CLINIC
HARASSMENT
GOES
BEYOND
EXPRESSION
TO
DIRECT
ATTACK
ON
PARTICULAR
PERSONS
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
WORKERS
AND
CLIENTS
AT
A
CLINIC
ITS
PURPOSE
IS
CLEARLY
NOT
TO
CONVEY
INFORMATION
OR
EXPRESS
AN
OPINION
BUT
TO
INTIMIDATE
AND
DO
HARM
TO
OTHER
OTHERS
EVEN
IF
THE
PROTESTERS
SPEECH
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
HARASSMENT
WHICH
IT
IS
NOT
HATE
SPEECH
LAWS
HAVE
GENERALLY
BEEN
STRUCK
DOWN
BY
THE
COURTS
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
THE
WORDS
DONT
KILL
YOUR
BABY
OR
ABORTION
IS
MURDER
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
HARASSMENT
ANTIABORTIONISTS
HAVE
LOST
THE
BATTLE
FOR
PUBLIC
OPINION
AND
THE
MORE
PSYCHOPATHIC
AMONG
THEM
HAVE
TURNED
TO
HARASSMENT
ARSON
BOMBING
AND
MURDER
TO
CARRY
ON
THEIR
WAR
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
NOT
TO
RESTRAIN
THEM
TO
PROTECT
THE
ORDINARY
CIVIL
RIGHTS
OF
EVERYONE
ELSE
SOME
OF
THE
PROTESTERS
WERE
ARRESTED
FOR
SIMPLY
PRAYING
QUIETLY
ON
A
PUBLIC
SIDEWALK
YEAH
I
COULD
SEE
HOW
THAT
MIGHT
BE
EQUIVALENT
TO
BOMBING
AND
MURDER
