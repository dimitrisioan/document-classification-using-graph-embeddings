it
is
a
matter
of
logic
that
governmentrun
systems
are
inefficient
and
the
fact
that
the
highly
bureaucratized
private
sector
system
in
the
us
is
vastly
more
inefficient
is
therefore
irrelevant
proof
that
the
entire
private
sector
is
vastly
more
inefficient
good
point
brett
it
might
merely
be
proof
that
basic
health
care
markets
operate
differently
with
certain
nonmarket
phenomenom
that
the
private
sector
cant
handle
well
like
armies
vs
warlords
in
that
respect
the
effects
on
american
society
vs
canadianeuropean
society
might
also
be
different
it
is
for
example
of
no
relevance
that
blue
cross
of
massachusetts
employs
people
more
than
are
employed
in
all
of
canadas
health
programs
which
insure
times
as
many
people
blue
cross
is
the
government
health
insurance
provider
good
point
again
blue
cross
in
the
us
is
quite
convoluted
compared
to
the
canadian
and
german
insurance
funds
which
have
a
minimal
organization
to
coordinate
it
if
anything
bureaucracy
now
needs
to
be
built
up
in
canada
to
combat
fraud
such
as
americans
crossing
the
border
individually
to
use
insurance
cards
borrowed
from
friends
and
relatives
or
using
phony
domestic
addresses
or
fraud
rings
stealing
them
in
blocks
our
private
practices
are
now
recording
insurance
account
numbers
both
public
insurance
and
private
insurance
which
most
have
never
bothered
to
do
before
on
assumption
of
an
honour
