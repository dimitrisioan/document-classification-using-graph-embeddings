ANY

ON
THAT
SUBJECT
MS
MYERS
WELL
CLEARLY
THE
REPORT
IS
THE
FIRST
ORDER
OF
BUSINESS
ITS
HIGH
ON
THE
AGENDA
ON
SOMETHING
THAT
THEYLL
DISCUSS
I
THINK
THE
PRESIDENT
AND
GENERAL
VESSEY
WILL
DISCUSS
THE
PARAMETERS
OF
HIS
VISIT
TO
VIETNAM
TODAY
BUT
THE
PRESIDENT
HASNT
DRAWN
ANY
CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT
THE
REPORT
YET
CERTAINLY
ITS
SOMETHING
THAT
HE
WANTS
GENERAL
VESSEY
TO
TALK
WITH
THE
VIETNAMESE
ABOUT
FIRST
Q
DID
THE
PRESIDENT
TALK
WITH
ANY
REPUBLICAN
SENATORS
YESTERDAY
ABOUT
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
MS
MYERS
HE
SPOKE
WITH
SENATOR
DOLE
Q
HOW
MANY
TIMES
MS
MYERS
I
BELIEVE
ONCE
DURING
THE
DAY
AND
ONCE
LAST
NIGHT
Q
WHAT
WAS
THE
OUTCOME
OF
THAT
MS
MYERS
THEYRE
CONTINUING
TO
WORK
TOWARD
SOME
KIND
OF
AN
AGREEMENT
ON
A
JOBS
PACKAGE
Q
IS
IT
YOUR
IMPRESSION
THAT
SENATOR
DOLE
IS
IN
ANY
WAY
FLEXIBLE
ON
THIS
MS
MYERS
WELL
I
THINK
WERE
HOPEFUL
THAT
WERE
GOING
TO
GET
SOME
KIND
OF
JOBS
PACKAGE
THROUGH
THE
SENATE
AND
WELL
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
WITH
SENATOR
DOLE
AND
OTHERS
UNTIL
WE
REACH
SOME
KIND
OF
AN
AGREEMENT
Q
DID
THEY
DISCUSS
THE
VAT
TAX
MS
MYERS
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THAT
CAME
UP
Q
CAN
YOU
CHECK
THAT
MS
MYERS
SURE
Q
SO
WHAT
ARE
THEY
IS
THE
PRESIDENT
OFFERING
TO
SCALE
DOWN
HIS
PROGRAM
IS
THAT
WHAT
HES
TRYING
TO
DO
BUY
IT
DOWN
TO
WHERE
DOLE
WILL
SIGN
ON
MS
MYERS
WELL
HES
TRYING
TO
PROTECT
AS
MUCH
OF
IT
AS
HE
CAN
BUT
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
HIM
TO
GET
SOME
KIND
OF
A
JOBS
PACKAGE
THROUGH
THE
SENATE
AND
THROUGH
CONGRESS
NOW
AND
AS
SOON
AS
WE
REACH
SOME
CONCLUSIONS
ON
THAT
WELL
LET
YOU
KNOW
BUT
AT
THE
MOMENT
HES
CONTINUING
TO
CONSULT
WITH
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS
INCLUDING
OBVIOUSLY
SENATOR
DOLE
Q
IS
HE
TALKING
TO
ANYBODY
ELSE
MS
MYERS
I
DONT
BELIEVE
HE
TALKED
TO
ANY
OTHER
REPUBLICANS
YESTERDAY
Q
IS
HE
TALKING
TO
ANYBODY
TODAY
MS
MYERS
I
DONT
THINK
ANYTHING
IS
SCHEDULED
BUT
I
WOULDNT
RULE
IT
OUT
Q
WE
WERE
LED
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
CALLED
MR
DOLE
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
RUSSIAN
AID
AND
THAT
BOB
DOLE
BROUGHT
THE
CONVERSATION
AROUND
TO
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
IS
THAT
CORRECT
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
CONTACTED
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
ON
RUSSIAN
AID
I
THINK
THAT
IT
WAS
ALWAYS
EXPECTED
THAT
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
OR
THE
JOBS
PACKAGE
WILL
BE
PART
OF
ANY
CONVERSATION
HE
WOULD
HAVE
WITH
SENATOR
DOLE
THE
PRIMARY
OBJECTIVE
OF
THE
CONVERSATION
WAS
RUSSIAN
AID
THAT
WAS
THE
FIRST
ORDER
OF
BUSINESS
BUT
IT
WAS
BOTH
Q
IN
THE
PRESIDENTS
MIND
ARE
THEY
LINKED
POLITICALLY
IN
THAT
IF
THE
REPUBLICANS
CONTINUE
TO
REJECT
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
HE
THINKS
IT
WILL
BE
HARDER
TO
SELL
RUSSIAN
AID
TO
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
HAS
HE
MADE
THAT
ARGUMENT
MS
MYERS
I
CANT
TALK
ABOUT
SPECIFICALLY
WHAT
ARGUMENTS
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
MADE
THE
PRESIDENT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
COMMITTED
TO
BOTH
HE
LIKED
TO
SEE
A
JOBS
PACKAGE
TO
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
FIRST
BUT
AS
YOU
KNOW
WE
OUTLINED
THE
DETAILS
OF
ADDITIONAL
RUSSIAN
AID
LAST
NIGHT
IN
TOKYO
Q
BUT
DOES
THE
PRESIDENT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
WILL
MAKE
IT
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
PERSUADE
AMERICANS
TO
VOTE
FOR
RUSSIAN
TO
ACCEPT
A
VOTE
FOR
RUSSIAN
AID
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
IS
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
TO
PASS
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
TO
PASS
A
JOBS
PACKAGE
AND
WERE
STILL
HOPEFUL
THAT
WELL
GET
SOME
KIND
OF
JOBS
PACKAGE
THROUGH
THE
CONGRESS
Q
IS
IT
FAIR
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
IS
NEGOTIATING
NOW
WITH
DOLE
MS
MYERS
HES
DISCUSSING
OPTIONS
WITH
HIM
Q
ON
THE
STIMULUS
IS
IT
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
OVER
THE
BREAK
SOME
DEMOCRATS
THEMSELVES
HAVE
LEFT
THE
SUPPORT
THAT
THEY
HAD
EARLIER
FOR
THE
PACKAGE
THE
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
WE
STILL
HAVE
WIDE
SUPPORT
IN
THE
SENATE
FOR
THE
JOBS
PACKAGE
Q
BUT
SPECIFICALLY
THAT
YOUVE
LOST
DEMOCRATS
OTHER
THAN
SHELBY
MS
MYERS
I
DONT
BELIEVE
SO
THERE
HASNT
BEEN
A
VOTE
Q
WHAT
ABOUT
KOHL
Q
KOHL
AND
FEINGOLD
MS
MYERS
THERE
HASNT
BEEN
A
VOTE
YET
AND
WELL
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
WITH
SENATORS
TO
TRY
TO
GET
A
MAJORITY
TO
TRY
TO
BRING
THE
PACKAGE
TO
A
VOTE
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
A
MAJORITY
OF
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
SENATE
SUPPORT
THE
PACKAGE
Q
IF
YOURE
WERENT
WORRIED
ABOUT
KOHL
AND
FEINGOLD
WHY
DID
GEORGE
MENTION
MILWAUKEE
PROJECTS
THE
OTHER
DAY
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
GEORGE
POINTED
OUT
A
NUMBER
OF
PROJECTS
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
STATES
THAT
STAND
TO
BE
FUNDED
OR
TO
LOSE
FUNDING
IF
THIS
JOBS
PACKAGE
DOESNT
PASS
Q
NO
DEMOCRATS
LAUGHTER
MS
MYERS
ILL
LET
YOU
DRAW
YOUR
OWN
CONCLUSIONS
Q
DOES
HE
PLAN
TO
TALK
TO
DOLE
AGAIN
TODAY
OR
ANY
OTHER
REPUBLICANS
AGAIN
TODAY
MS
MYERS
THERES
NOTHING
SPECIFICALLY
SCHEDULED
BUT
AGAIN
I
WOULDNT
RULE
IT
OUT
Q
DOES
HE
PLAN
TO
PUT
OUT
ANY
MORE
PRESS
RELEASES
TO
ANY
OTHER
STATES
TODAY
MS
MYERS
WHAT
WEVE
DONE
IS
WERE
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
BREAKING
DOWN
THE
BENEFITS
OF
THE
JOBS
PACKAGE
STATE
BY
STATE
I
THINK
ITS
ENTIRELY
FEASIBLE
THAT
AS
WE
SORT
OF
ARE
ABLE
TO
SUM
THOSE
UP
WELL
SEND
OUT
PRESS
RELEASES
TO
THE
VARIOUS
STATES
THAT
SUGGEST
HOW
THEIR
STATES
WOULD
BENEFIT
FROM
THIS
PACKAGE
Q
WILL
YOU
SHARE
THOSE
WITH
US
MS
MYERS
SURE
AS
WE
DID
YESTERDAY
Q
DO
YOU
HAVE
COPIES
OF
THE
ONES
YOU
SENT
MS
MYERS
YES
WE
MADE
THOSE
AVAILABLE
YESTERDAY
AND
WE
CERTAINLY
CAN
CONTINUE
TO
PROVIDE
THEM
TODAY
Q
DEE
DEE
SINCE
YESTERDAYS
QUESTIONS
AND
SUBSEQUENT
STORIES
ABOUT
THE
VAT
WHAT
FURTHER
CONSIDERATION
OF
THIS
ISSUE
HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
MS
MYERS
NOTHINGS
CHANGED
SINCE
YESTERDAY
I
THINK
THE
PRESIDENT
COMMENTED
ON
IT
THIS
MORNING
TO
SAY
ONLY
THAT
IT
WAS
SOMETHING
HE
KNEW
WAS
BEING
CONSIDERED
BY
THE
TASK
FORCE
AND
THAT
HE
HAS
NOT
MADE
A
DECISION
ON
AND
I
DONT
THINK
WE
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
ADD
TO
THAT
Q
BUT
HE
ALSO
SAID
THAT
BUSINESS
AND
LABOR
GROUPS
ARE
TELLING
HIM
THEY
SUPPORT
IT
CAN
YOU
TELL
US
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
THAT
THERE
HAS
BEEN
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
SPECULATE
ON
WHO
SUPPORTS
IT
I
THINK
THE
PRESIDENT
SAID
THAT
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
SUPPORT
AMONG
BUSINESS
AND
LABOR
GROUPS
I
DONT
THINK
HE
SAID
HE
WAS
DIRECTLY
CONTACTED
BY
THEM
Q
ARE
WE
TO
TAKE
THAT
TO
MEAN
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
SOUNDED
OUT
BUSINESS
AND
LABOR
GROUPS
ON
THIS
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
THERES
BEEN
PLENTY
OF
PUBLIC
DISCOURSE
ON
THIS
OVER
THE
YEARS
AND
EVEN
RECENTLY
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
I
WANT
TO
ADD
TO
THAT
Q
IN
FEBRUARY
THOUGH
THE
PRESIDENT
SAID
THAT
THIS
WAS
SOMETHING
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
OR
YEARS
DOWN
THE
ROAD
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED
BETWEEN
THEN
AND
NOW
TO
CAUSE
THIS
ADMINISTRATION
TO
CHANGE
ITS
MIND
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
AS
WE
SAID
YESTERDAY
IT
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
ARE
LOOKING
AT
THEYRE
CONSIDERING
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
OPTIONS
ON
EVERYTHING
FROM
FUNDING
TO
SPECIFIC
OPTIONS
THAT
WILL
BE
COVERED
BY
THE
PRESIDENTS
HEALTH
CARE
PLAN
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
NOT
TAKEN
IT
UP
YET
HAS
NOT
MADE
A
DECISION
ON
IT
AND
BEYOND
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
ADD
Q
YOU
HAVENT
ANSWERED
THE
QUESTION
IT
WASNT
BEING
CONSIDERED
BY
ANYONE
IN
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
AFTER
THE
PRESIDENTS
COMMENTS
IN
FEBRUARY
AND
GEORGE
REAFFIRMED
THAT
IN
A
BRIEFING
Q
AND
THEN
SUDDENLY
Q
WHAT
HAPPENED
MS
MYERS
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
AS
WE
HAVE
SAID
THROUGHOUT
WE
INSTRUCTED
TO
CONSIDER
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
OPTIONS
ACROSSTHEBOARD
AND
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
HAS
BEEN
TALKED
ABOUT
AND
THAT
THEY
ARE
CLEARLY
CONSIDERING
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
A
VALUEADDED
TAX
Q
BUT
THE
PRESIDENT
HIMSELF
TOOK
THIS
OFF
THE
TABLE
DEE
DEE
AND
SUDDENLY
IT
REAPPEARS
AND
THIS
GOES
TO
THE
CREDIBILITY
OF
THIS
ADMINISTRATION
IN
A
WAY
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED
IN
THE
MEANTIME
MS
MYERS
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
NOT
LOOKED
AT
THIS
IT
HASNT
BEEN
PRESENTED
TO
HIM
AGAIN
YET
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
ARE
LOOKING
AT
IT
AS
THEYRE
LOOKING
AT
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
OPTIONS
AND
NO
DECISIONS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
Q
AND
IT
RAISES
THE
QUESTION
OF
HOW
INDEPENDENTLY
THE
TASK
FORCE
IS
WORKING
MS
MYERS
THE
TASK
FORCE
WAS
INSTRUCTED
TO
CONSIDER
ALL
OPTIONS
AND
THEYVE
TAKEN
THAT
MANDATE
SERIOUSLY
AND
THEYRE
CONSIDERING
ALL
OPTIONS
Q
BUT
THATS
NOT
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
LEFT
IN
FEBRUARY
THE
IMPRESSION
HE
LEFT
WAS
THAT
THIS
WAS
SOMETHING
THAT
WAS
LONGRANGE
TO
BE
LOOKED
AT
YEARS
DOWN
THE
ROAD
THE
CLEAR
IMPLICATION
OF
HIS
REMARKS
WAS
THAT
THIS
WAS
SOMETHING
THAT
WAS
NOT
ON
THE
TABLE
NOT
AN
OPTION
Q
IF
IT
CHANGES
ILL
TELL
YOU
Q
BRING
HIM
ON
Q
AND
YOU
REPEATEDLY
REFERRED
TO
THE
PRESIDENTS
REMARKS
TELLING
US
THAT
THOSE
WERE
STILL
IN
OPERATION
MS
MYERS
ITS
CHANGED
AND
WE
TOLD
YOU
LAUGHTER
Q
BUT
THATS
WHAT
ALICE
RIVLINS
COMMENTS
AND
DONNA
SHALALA
COMMENTS
WERE
ABOUT
I
MEAN
THAT
SEEMED
LIKE
AN
ORCHESTRATED
EFFORT
BECAUSE
YOU
HAVE
TWO
INDEPENDENT
CABINET
OFFICERS
MS
MYERS
I
WOULDNT
NO
ALICE
RIVLINS
NOT
A
CABINET
MEMBER
FIRST
OF
ALL
SECOND
OF
ALL
IT
WAS
NOT
ORCHESTRATED
BUT
CLEARLY
THEY
BOTH
SAID
YESTERDAY
AND
IN
THE
LAST
COUPLE
OF
DAYS
THAT
ITS
SOMETHING
THATS
BEING
LOOKED
AT
WE
CONFIRMED
THAT
YESTERDAY
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
ADD
TO
THAT
Q
IS
IT
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
VERY
FEW
OPTIONS
Q
IS
THIS
SOMETHING
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
INCUMBENT
UPON
THE
TASK
FORCE
TO
CONVINCE
THE
PRESIDENT
ABOUT
IN
OTHER
WORDS
HAS
THE
PRESIDENT
HIMSELF
PERSONALLY
RULED
IT
OUT
AND
ITS
NOW
UP
TO
THE
TASK
FORCE
TO
CONVINCE
HIM
TO
PUT
IT
BACK
ON
THE
TABLE
OR
IS
IT
IN
FACT
BACK
ON
THE
TABLE
HAVING
BEEN
PLACED
THERE
BY
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
THE
PRESIDENT
MS
MYERS
IT
IS
NOT
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
MISSION
AT
THIS
POINT
TO
CONVINCE
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
ANYTHING
IT
IS
THEIR
MISSION
TO
PUT
BEFORE
HIM
HIS
OPTIONS
AND
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
BENEFITS
AND
THE
COSTS
AND
THE
BASIC
PROS
AND
CONS
OF
EACH
OF
THOSE
OPTIONS
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
WILL
CERTAINLY
PRESENT
THE
VAT
TO
HIM
IN
THAT
CONTEXT
AND
AT
THIS
POINT
HES
NOT
THAT
PRESENTATION
HAS
NOT
BEEN
MADE
BUT
ITS
SOMETHING
THAT
HE
WILL
HEAR
AND
HE
HAS
NOT
MADE
A
DECISION
ON
Q
THEY
WILL
PRESENT
IT
TO
HIM
AS
ONE
OF
HIS
OPTIONS
THOUGH
HE
SPECIFICALLY
RULED
IT
OUT
MS
MYERS
CORRECT
Q
DEE
DEE
IS
THIS
MORE
THAN
A
TRIAL
BALLOON
IS
THIS
A
SERIOUS
CONSIDERATION
THAT
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
ARE
GIVING
TO
THIS
FORM
OF
TAXATION
MS
MYERS
ITS
SIMPLY
A
STATEMENT
OF
FACT
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
ARE
CONSIDERING
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
OPTIONS
ON
A
NUMBER
OF
ISSUES
RELATING
TO
HEALTH
CARE
REFORM
ONE
OF
THE
OPTIONS
THAT
THEYRE
LOOKING
AT
IS
THE
VAT
Q
DEE
DEE
WHEN
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
WERE
EXAMINING
THIS
POSSIBILITY
WAS
THIS
ON
THE
TABLE
DURING
THE
SAME
TIME
PERIOD
THAT
YOU
WERE
TELLING
US
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
MS
MYERS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
SPECIFIC
TIMING
OF
THEIR
DRAFTING
OF
OPTIONS
IS
I
DONT
KNOW
Q
WHO
WAS
TELLING
YOU
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
MS
MYERS
I
WAS
REFERRING
BACK
TO
THE
PRESIDENTS
COMMENTS
Q
HAVE
THEY
DISCOVERED
THAT
THE
SIN
TAXES
WONT
RAISE
ENOUGH
MONEY
TO
FUND
THE
CORE
BENEFIT
PACKAGE
MS
MYERS
NO
THERES
NO
DECISIONS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
ON
HOW
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
HEALTH
CARE
PLAN
Q
IM
ASKING
WHETHER
THE
PROJECTIONS
MS
MYERS
THERES
A
NUMBER
OF
OPTIONS
DEPENDING
ON
HOW
THE
PLAN
IS
STRUCTURED
YOU
CANT
DECIDE
HOW
MUCH
THE
PLAN
IS
GOING
TO
COST
UNTIL
YOU
DECIDE
WHAT
THE
PLAN
IS
GOING
TO
LOOK
LIKE
AND
SO
YOU
CANT
DISCUSS
WHAT
FINANCING
OPTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
RULED
IN
OUR
OUT
UNTIL
YOU
KNOW
Q
DEE
DEE
WEVE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
COMPUTER
MODELS
ON
A
NUMBER
OF
POSSIBLE
PACKAGES
MS
MYERS
CORRECT
Q
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
THEY
HAVE
NOW
DETERMINED
WHETHER
SIN
TAXES
WOULD
NOT
PRODUCE
ENOUGH
MONEY
FOR
EVEN
THE
BAREST
MINIMUM
PACKAGE
THAT
IS
NOT
A
VERY
DIFFICULT
COMPUTATION
MS
MYERS
IT
IS
A
QUESTION
THAT
YOU
KNOW
THAT
WERE
NOT
GOING
TO
ANSWER
UNTIL
THERES
A
NUMBER
OF
OPTIONS
BEING
CONSIDERED
IT
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
THE
PACKAGE
IS
STRUCTURED
THE
EXACT
DETAILS
OF
THE
PACKAGE
AND
THE
FINANCING
MECHANISMS
USED
TO
PAY
FOR
THEM
ARE
ALL
AMONG
THE
DECISIONS
THAT
HAVE
YET
TO
BE
MADE
Q
AND
WHEN
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
BEEN
MEETING
WITH
HEALTH
CARE
HIS
HEALTH
CARE
ADVISORS
WHICH
WE
ARE
TOLD
HE
HAS
BEEN
DOING
MS
MYERS
CORRECT
Q
THEY
HAVE
NEVER
ONCE
SAID
TO
HIM
THESE
ARE
YOUR
FUNDING
OPTIONS
INCLUDING
THE
VAT
HE
HAS
NEVER
HEARD
THE
WORD
VAT
IN
HIS
MS
MYERS
I
AM
NOT
GOING
TO
COMMENT
ON
THE
SPECIFIC
NATURE
OF
THE
DAILY
THEYRE
NOT
DAILY
BUT
THE
QUASIREGULAR
BRIEFINGS
Q
WELL
YOU
HAVE
MS
MYERS
I
HAVE
NOT
OTHER
THAN
TO
SAY
THAT
HES
NOT
CONSIDERED
THE
VAT
AND
I
THINK
THAT
IS
A
TRUE
STATEMENT
Q
NO
BUT
YOU
SAID
THAT
IT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
PRESENTED
TO
HIM
AS
AN
OPTION
MS
MYERS
CORRECT
Q
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
HE
HASNT
HEARD
ABOUT
IT
MS
MYERS
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
GET
INTO
THE
DETAILS
OF
WHATS
DISCUSSED
I
THINK
THAT
STATEMENT
STANDS
FOR
ITSELF
Q
SPECIFIC
DEE
DEE
WHEN
YOU
SAY
HE
HASNT
LOOKED
AT
IT
DO
YOU
MEAN
THAT
HE
HASNT
LOOKED
AT
IT
IN
TERMS
OF
PAYING
FOR
MEDICAL
COVERAGE
OR
HASNT
LOOKED
AT
IT
IN
GENERAL
BECAUSE
BACK
IN
CHILICOTHE
HE
WAS
VERY
SPECIFIC
IN
DEFINING
HOW
IT
WORKS
WHAT
THE
ADVANTAGES
ARE
THE
WHOLE
THING
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
MS
MYERS
BUT
THAT
WAS
I
THINK
IN
CHILICOTHE
IF
YOU
GO
BACK
TO
HIS
REMARKS
THERE
IT
WAS
A
BROADER
PHILOSOPHICAL
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
TAX
STRUCTURE
AND
I
THINK
THE
COMMENTS
WERE
GENERALLY
IN
REFERENCE
TO
THE
OVERALL
ECONOMIC
PLAN
BUT
CLEARLY
ITS
SOMETHING
THAT
HES
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IN
THE
BROAD
CONTEXT
I
MEAN
THAT
WAS
CLEAR
IN
CHILICOTHE
WHAT
IM
SAYING
IS
THAT
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
ITS
SOMETHING
THAT
HE
HASNT
CONSIDERED
YET
ITS
SOMETHING
THAT
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
WILL
PRESENT
TO
HIM
AMONG
THE
NUMBER
OF
OPTIONS
AND
THAT
NO
DECISIONS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
AND
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
COMMENT
ANY
FURTHER
ON
THE
DETAILS
OF
THE
MEETINGS
WHERE
HEALTH
CARE
ISSUES
ARE
BEING
DISCUSSED
Q
ITS
YOUR
STATEMENT
FROM
THIS
PODIUM
THAT
NO
DISCUSSION
OF
THIS
HAS
TAKEN
PLACE
YOU
SAY
THAT
NO
OPTION
THAT
THE
OPTION
HAS
NOT
BEEN
PRESENTED
TO
HIM
MS
MYERS
THAT
IS
CORRECT
Q
DO
YOU
STAND
BY
DOES
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
STILL
STAND
BY
GEORGES
STATEMENT
IN
MARCH
THAT
THIS
WILL
NOT
BE
IN
THE
PROPOSAL
MS
MYERS
NO
DECISIONS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
WE
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
ADD
TO
WHATS
ALREADY
BEEN
SAID
Q
LET
ME
FOLLOW
UP
HERE
DO
YOU
STAND
BY
WHAT
RIVLIN
SAID
YESTERDAY
THAT
IF
ANY
KIND
OF
VAT
WERE
TO
BE
USED
OR
CONSIDERED
THAT
OTHER
CHANGES
TO
THE
TAX
CODE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
MADE
SO
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
LESS
REGRESSIVE
MS
MYERS
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
COMMENT
ANY
FURTHER
ON
WHAT
MIGHT
HAPPEN
IF
Q
BUT
DO
YOU
STAND
BY
THE
PREVIOUS
CONVERSATIONS
IN
FEBRUARY
THAT
IF
THERE
WERE
TO
BE
A
VAT
I
THINK
THE
PRESIDENT
SAID
YOUD
EXCLUDE
FOOD
AND
ENERGY
MS
MYERS
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
COMMENT
ON
THE
SPECIFIC
STRUCTURE
OF
A
DECISION
THAT
HASNT
BEEN
MADE
Q
WAS
THE
PRESIDENT
AWARE
PRIOR
TO
DONNA
SHALALAS
COMMENTS
YESTERDAY
THAT
THIS
WAS
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
BY
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
MS
MYERS
I
DONT
KNOW
SPECIFICALLY
WHAT
Q
COULD
YOU
CHECK
FOR
US
BECAUSE
THATS
A
REAL
IMPORTANT
CREDIBILITY
QUESTION
MS
MYERS
SURE
Q
SINCE
THE
TASK
FORCE
WAS
BROUGHT
TOGETHER
THIS
ISSUE
HAS
BEEN
DISCUSSED
AT
THE
BEGINNING
AND
THROUGHOUT
AS
ONE
FAIRLY
PAINLESS
WAY
TO
RAISE
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
WERE
YOU
ALL
KEPT
IN
THE
DARK
WAS
THE
PRESS
OFFICE
KEPT
IN
THE
DARK
OVER
THE
PAST
MONTH
AND
A
HALF
WHEN
YOUVE
BEEN
DENYING
THAT
A
VAT
TAX
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
THAT
IT
WAS
ACTUALLY
ON
THE
TABLE
OVER
THERE
AS
AN
OPTION
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
WEVE
SAID
ALL
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
SAY
IT
IS
SOMETHING
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
ARE
LOOKING
AT
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
NOT
MADE
A
DECISION
ABOUT
IT
YET
AND
BEYOND
THAT
I
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
ADD
Q
WELL
SORRY
DEE
DEE
THERE
ARE
STILL
A
COUPLE
OF
QUESTIONS
THAT
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
ASK
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
CREDIBILITY
HERE
YOURS
PRIMARILY
WHAT
WERE
ASKING
IS
IF
YOU
ALL
WERE
NOT
TOLD
AT
ALL
THAT
THIS
THING
WAS
BEING
CONSIDERED
WHILE
YOU
WERE
COMING
OUT
HERE
AND
TELLING
US
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
OR
IF
ITS
A
CASE
THAT
YOU
WERE
COMING
OUT
HERE
AND
DELIBERATELY
MISLEADING
US
MS
MYERS
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
ANYONE
HAS
EVER
COME
OUT
HERE
AND
DELIBERATELY
MISLED
YOU
FROM
THIS
PODIUM
EVER
EVER
Q
HAS
ANYONE
TRIED
TO
SHADE
IT
A
LITTLE
BIT
TO
INDICATE
SOMETHING
HAS
ANYBODY
TOLD
ANYBODY
TO
COME
OUT
MS
MYERS
WERE
NOT
TRYING
TO
SHADE
ANSWERS
OR
DELIBERATELY
MISLEAD
ANYBODY
IVE
SAID
WHAT
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THIS
ISSUE
Q
ALL
WE
WERE
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
MS
MYERS
I
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
YOURE
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
AND
IVE
GIVEN
YOU
THE
ANSWERS
HELEN
Q
WERE
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
CHANGED
WHAT
MADE
IT
AN
OPTION
AGAIN
THATS
THE
MS
MYERS
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
WERE
GIVEN
A
BROAD
MANDATE
TO
INVESTIGATE
ALL
OPTIONS
AND
THEY
ARE
DOING
THAT
Q
YES
BUT
IT
WASNT
AN
OPTION
BEFORE
HOW
CAN
YOU
INVESTIGATE
IT
IF
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
TAKEN
IT
OFF
THE
TABLE
MS
MYERS
IT
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
THEYRE
OBVIOUSLY
CONSIDERING
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
NOT
MADE
A
DECISION
ON
Q
YES
BUT
HE
TOOK
IT
OFF
THE
TABLE
IN
FEBRUARY
MS
MYERS
WORKING
GROUPS
ARE
CONSIDERING
IT
THEYLL
PRESENT
IT
TO
THE
PRESIDENT
AT
SOME
POINT
AND
HELL
MAKE
A
DECISION
Q
WHY
WOULD
THEY
CONSIDER
IT
IF
HE
HAS
TAKEN
IT
OFF
THE
TABLE
MS
MYERS
ITS
CLEARLY
ON
THE
TABLE
Q
YES
BUT
HE
TOOK
IT
OFF
THE
TABLE
DID
HE
CHANGE
HIS
MIND
MS
MYERS
ITS
BACK
ON
THE
TABLE
BILL
Q
DID
HE
CHANGE
HIS
MIND
MS
MYERS
HE
SAID
THIS
MORNING
THAT
HE
HASNT
MADE
A
DECISION
ABOUT
IT
HE
OBVIOUSLY
KNOWS
THAT
ITS
ON
THE
TABLE
ITS
SOMETHING
THAT
HE
WILL
LOOK
AT
AT
SOME
AND
WHEN
WE
HAVE
A
DECISION
ON
THIS
WELL
LET
YOU
KNOW
Q
SO
HE
MUST
HAVE
CHANGED
HIS
MIND
RIGHT
MS
MYERS
AT
SOME
POINT
IT
WILL
BE
LOOKED
AT
I
MEAN
Q
DEE
DEE
THERES
LIKE
TWO
OPTIONS
EITHER
HE
CHANGED
HIS
MIND
OR
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
THINK
THEYRE
AUTHORITY
EXCEEDS
THE
PRESIDENTS
MS
MYERS
THE
WORKING
GROUPS
WERE
GIVEN
A
BROAD
MANDATE
TO
LOOK
AT
ALL
OPTIONS
THEYVE
DONE
THAT
Q
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
PUT
OUT
HIS
INCOME
TAX

AVAILABLE
Q
WILL
THERE
BE
ANY
KIND
OF
BRIEFING
TO
GO
THROUGH
IT
MS
MYERS
NO
NOTHINGS
PLANNED
I
THINK
SOMEONE
WILL
BE
AVAILABLE
PROBABLY
NOT
IN
A
BRIEFING
SETTING
BUT
TO
WALK
YOU
THROUGH
THE
QUESTIONS
Q
WERE
USED
TO
BE
WALKED
LINEBYLINE
THROUGH
THE
PRESIDENTIAL
TAX
FORMS
MS
MYERS
IVE
SEEN
THOSE
BRIEFINGS
LAUGHTER
Q
COULD
WE
HAVE
ONE
MS
MYERS
NO
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
WILL
BE
ANY
KIND
OF
A
FORMAL
BRIEFING
BUT
THERE
WILL
BE
SOMEBODY
AVAILABLE
TO
ANSWER
YOUR
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
IT
Q
DID
THEY
FILE
A
JOINT
FORM
MS
MYERS
YES
Q
WHEN
DID
HE
FILE

MYERS
I
BELIEVE
ITS
BEING
FILED
TODAY
Q
DEE
DEE
IS
THERE
GOING
TO
BE
A
BACKGROUNDER
FOR
MIYAZAWA
MS
MYERS
NO
THERE

A
READOUT
AFTER

COMPLICATED
STUFF
WE
NEED

LAUGHTER
MS
MYERS
WE
CANT
GIVE
YOU
TAXES
AND
MIYAZAWA
ALL
IN
ONE
DAY
ITS
TOO
CONFUSING
LAUGHTER
Q
VANCE
AND
OWEN
HAVE
OPENED
THE
DOORS
ON
THE
USE
OF
FORCE
IN
BOSNIA
THEYVE
BOTH
SAID
THAT
A
THEY
NEVER
RULED
IT
OUT
AND
B
IT
MIGHT
BE
NECESSARY
NOW
DOES
THAT
INFLUENCE
YOUR
THINKING
ON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
TO
CHANGE
YOUR
APPROACH
MS
MYERS
THERES
BEEN
NO
CHANGE
IN
OUR
POLICY
TOWARDS
BOSNIA
WE
HAVE
ALWAYS
SAID
THAT
WED
CONSIDER
Q
BUT
DOES
THAT
IMPACT
UPON
YOUR
DECISION
ARE
THEY
PEOPLE
WHOSE
OPINIONS
WOULD
CARRY
WEIGHT
WITH
YOU
MS
MYERS
THEYRE
PEOPLE
WHOSE
OPINIONS
CARRY
WEIGHT
CERTAINLY
I
MEAN
THE
PRESIDENT
SUPPORTS
THE
PROCESS
THAT
THEYVE
INITIATED
BUT
THERES
BEEN
NO
CHANGE
IN
OUR
POLICY
FOR
BOSNIA
ALTHOUGH
WERE
CONSIDERING
A
NUMBER
OF
OPTIONS
RIGHT
NOW
IF
THE
SERBS
DONT
COME
BACK
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
IF
THEY
DONT
SIGN
ON
TO
SOME
KIND
OF
AN
AGREEMENT
WE
WILL
CONSIDER
ADDITIONAL
OPTIONS
WHICH
WEVE
BEEN
SAYING
REGULARLY
Q
ONE
FOLLOWUP
QUESTION
THEN
WE
CANNOT
GET
A
STRAIGHT
ANSWER
FROM
ANYONE
IN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
WHY
DO
YOU
NOT
SET
A
DEADLINE
FOR
THE
SERBS
CAN
YOU
TELL
US
THE
STRATEGIC
OR
TACTICAL
REASONS
FOR
NOT
GIVING
THEM
A
DEADLINE
TO
COME
TO
THE
TABLE
MS
MYERS
WERE
CONTINUING
TO
PUT
PRESSURE
ON
THEM
EVERY
DAY
Q
WHICH
DOESNT
WORK
SO
MS
MYERS
WELL
WE
THINK
IT
IS
HAVING
SOME
EFFECT
WERE
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
TIGHTEN
SANCTIONS
AS
YOU
KNOW
WE
SUPPORT
THE
OMNIBUS
RESOLUTION
WE
EXPECT
THAT
TO
COME
TO
A
VOTE
ON
THE
Q
YOU
SAY
ITS
HAVING
AN
EFFECT
CAN
YOU
GIVE
US
ANY
DOCUMENTATION
MS
MYERS
ID
BE
HAPPY
TO
PROVIDE
SOMEBODY
TO
TALK
TO
YOU
ABOUT
THE
IMPACT
OF
THE
SANCTIONS
AND
THINGS
LIKE
THAT
Q
THERES
BEEN
NO
YOU
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
PROVIDE
ANYBODY
WHO
CAN
TELL
US
THAT
THE
SANCTIONS
HAVE
HAD
ANY
EFFECT
IN
BOSNIA
SERBIA
YES
IN
BOSNIA
NO
MS
MYERS
I
THINK
THAT
THEYVE
HAD
EFFECT
IN
SERBIA
AND
WE
THINK
THEYVE
HAD
SOME
EFFECT
IN
BOSNIA
AND
AGAIN
ILL
BE
HAPPY
TO
PROVIDE
SOMEBODY
TO
WALK
YOU
THROUGH
THE
DETAILS
OF
THAT
IF
YOUD
LIKE
Q
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
CAN
SHOW
US
WHAT
THE
EFFECT
HAS
BEEN
IN
BOSNIA
WE
HAD
THE
BRIEFING
ON
ALL
OF
THE
TERRIBLE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
HAPPENING
IN
BELGRADE
BUT
WE
HAVENT
SEEN
ANYTHING
THAT
INDICATES
AN
IMPACT
ON
THE
FIGHTING
CAN
YOU
PROVIDE
SOMETHING
ALONG
THOSE
LINES
MS
MYERS
I
WILL
SEE
WHAT
I
CAN
GET
YOU
Q
ON
THE
EXTRA
RUSSIAN
AID
THAT
CHRISTOPHER
ANNOUNCED
THIS
MORNING
WHERE
IS
THAT
MONEY
COMING
FROM
MS
MYERS
WELL
HAVE
TO
WORK
WITH
CONGRESS
ON
THE
DETAILS
OF
THAT
PACKAGE
Q
SO
THAT
WOULD
BE
NEW
MONEY
THAT
YOU
WOULD
HOPE
TO
GET
MS
MYERS
YES
THATS
NEW
MONEY
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
BILLION
ANNOUNCED
IN
VANCOUVER
SO
I
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
ALL
HAVE
SEEN
THE
PACKAGE
THAT
WAS
ANNOUNCED
THIS
MORNING
IN
TOKYO
BY
SECRETARY
CHRISTOPHER
Q
ISNT
THERE
A
CONCERN
THOUGH
ABOUT
OFFERING
SOMETHING
WHICH
YOU
HAVE
TO
GET
IN
CONGRESS
I
MEAN
THAT
WAS
THE
CONCERN
WITH
VANCOUVER
YOU
DIDNT
WANT
TO
DO
THAT
MS
MYERS
THE
CONCERN
WITH
VANCOUVER
WAS
TO
DO
SOMETHING
IMMEDIATELY
WHICH
REQUIRED
MONEY
THAT
WAS
ALREADY
APPROVED
IN
THE
FISCAL
BUDGET
WHAT
WERE
LOOKING
AT
NOW
IS
A
LITTLE
BIT
LONGERTERM
PLAN
TO
BUILD
ON
TOP
OF
THE
BILLION
THAT
WE
ANNOUNCED
IN
VANCOUVER
THIS
CLEARLY
WILL
REQUIRE
CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL
OR
SOME
OF
IT
WILL
ANYWAY
AND
WERE
GOING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
WITH
CONGRESS
TO
MAKE
THAT
HAPPEN
Q
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
HAS
THAT
BEEN
VETTED
OR
AGREED
TO
BY
CONGRESS
MS
MYERS
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
HAD
A
NUMBER
OF
CONVERSATIONS
WITH
MEMBERS
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
WITH
THEM
AS
THIS
PROCESS
MOVES
FORWARD
Q
WAS
CHRISTOPHER
ABLE
TO
PUT
THIS
PACKAGE
OUT
WITH
A
FAIR
DEGREE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
YOU
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
IT
THROUGH
CONGRESS
MS
MYERS
IT
WAS
CREATED
IN
CONSULTATION
WITH
CONGRESS
Q
IN
MEETING
WITH
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS
IS
THAT
DOES
THAT
HAVE
A
SET
SPEECH
AND
A
GOAL
A
DIRECTION
MS
MYERS
YES
THE
PRESIDENT
WILL
TALK
ABOUT
AND
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
ENDORSING
THE
PRESIDENTS
JOBS
PACKAGE
THEY
BELIEVE
PARTICULARLY
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
PACKAGE
WILL
HELP
GIVE
KIDS
SOMETHING
TO
DO
Q
WHO
ARE
THEY
MS
MYERS
ITS
MEMBERS
OR
LEADERSHIP
FROM
THREE
ORGANIZATIONS
NAPO
WHICH
IS
THE
NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION
OF
POLICE
ORGANIZATIONS
IBPO
WHICH
IS
THE
INTERNATIONAL
BROTHERHOOD
OF
POLICE
ORGANIZATIONS
I
BELIEVE
AND
IUPA
WHICH
IS
THE
INTERNATIONAL
UNION
OF
POLICE
ASSOCIATIONS
Q
WILL
THE
FBI
CHIEF
BE
THERE
MS
MYERS
THE
FBI
CHIEF
NO
Q
OR
ANY
OTHER
FEDERAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS
MS
MYERS
NO
IT
WILL
BE
THE
PRESIDENT
AND
THESE
NATIONAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
ORGANIZATION
LEADERS
Q
DOES
THE
BILLION
ANNOUNCED
TODAY
INCLUDE
THE
MILLION
THATS
IN
THE
FY
BUDGET
FOR
DISARMAMENT
MS
MYERS
NO
THE
NUNNLUGAR
MONEY
IS
SEPARATE
Q
SO
THIS
WOULD
BE
THE
MILLION
THATS
IN
THE
BUDGET
ALREADY
PLUS
ANOTHER
BILLION
MS
MYERS
I
BELIEVE
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
ON
TOP
OF
THE
MILLION
ALREADY
IN
THE
BUDGET
Q
IS
THIS
GOING
TO
BE
PART
OF
THE
SUPPLEMENTAL
OR
FISCAL
MS
MYERS
WELL
WORK
WITH
CONGRESS
ON
THE
EXACT
FUNDING
MECHANISM
ON
EXACTLY
HOW
THIS
WILL
BE
PAID
FOR
Q
THIS
BILLION
ON
TOP
OF
MS
MYERS
ON
TOP
OF
MILLION
ON
TOP
OF
THE
MILLION
NUNNLUGAR
MONEY
WE
ANNOUNCED
EARLIER
Q
AND
THIS
IS
WHAT
PROMPTED
THE
PRESIDENT
TO
CALL
BOB
DOLE
IT
WAS
ON
THIS
TRANCHE
NOT
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
MONEY
HE
WAS
CALLING
BOB
DOLE
MS
MYERS
CORRECT
Q
IS
THERE
A
BRIEFING
ON
MIYAZAWA
MS
MYERS
THERE
WILL
BE
A
READOUT
AFTER
THE
MEETING
WITH
MIYAZAWA
TOMORROW
Q
DEE
DEE
ON
A
TOTALLY
UNRELATED
MATTER
SOME
REPUBLICANS
WHO
ARE
ACTIVE
IN
THE
US
CHAMBER
OF
COMMERCE
ARE
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
THIS
NEW
COZY
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
AND
THE
CHAMBER
OF
COMMERCE
THERE
ARE
THE
TOWN
HALL
MEETING
THE
OTHER
NIGHT
THE
SATELLITE
AND
ALL
OF
THIS
RELATIONSHIP
DOES
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
FEEL
THAT
YOURE
GETTING
TOO
CLOSE
TO
THESE
CHAMBERS
OF
COMMERCE
MS
MYERS
THATS
AN
INTERESTING
CHARGE
LAUGHTER
AFTER
HOW
MANY
YEARS
OF
DEMOCRATS
BEING
ACCUSED
OF
NOT
PAYING
ANY
ATTENTION
TO
THE
CHAMBERS
NOW
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
ACCUSE
US
OF
BEING
TOO
CLOSE
I
THINK
THATS
INTERESTING
BUT
NO
WERE
THRILLED
BY
THE
SUPPORT
WEVE
RECEIVED
FROM
THE
NATIONAL
CHAMBER
AND
LOCAL
CHAMBERS
ACROSS
THE
COUNTRY
AND
WELL
CONTINUE
TO
WORK
WITH
THEM
ON
THIS
AND
OTHER
INITIATIVES
Q
WHATS
THE
STATUS
OF
THE
PRESIDENT
THINKING
ABOUT
GOING
TO
THIS
DEMOCRATIC
RETREAT
MS
MYERS
ITS
ON
HIS
CALENDAR
I
THINK
HELL
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
GO
Q
ALL
THREE
DAYS

MYERS
WE
HAVENT
FIGURED
OUT
EXACTLY
WHEN
HELL
BE
THERE
YET
Q
IS
IT
OPEN
TO

MS
MYERS
NO
I
BELIEVE
THE
WHOLE
THING
IS
CLOSED
Q
IS
HE
GOING
TO
HAVE
ANY
KIND
OF
ADDRESS
STATEMENT
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
ON
THE
GAY
RIGHTS
MARCH
ON
THE
MS
MYERS

STILL
LOOKING
AT

FINAL
DECISION
ABOUT
HOW
WELL
WHO

MAKE
A
STATEMENT
OR
WHAT
Q
ANY
MEETINGS
SCHEDULED
WITH
ANY
OF
THE
LEADERS

GAY
RIGHTS
OR

LONG
TIME

THE
