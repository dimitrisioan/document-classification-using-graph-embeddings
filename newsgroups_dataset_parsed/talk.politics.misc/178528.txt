DAVID
VEAL
WRITES
COME
TO
THAT
UNDER
THE
ORIGINAL
PLAN
THERE
WASNT
MEANT
TO
BE
ANYTHING
MUCH
FOR
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TO
DO
EXCEPT
KEEP
THE
BRITISH
OUT
THATS
ALSO
UNTRUE
BUT
AT
LEAST
WERE
WANDERING
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
TOWARD
REALITY
THAT
THE
ARTICLES
OF
CONFEDERATION
FELL
APART
IS
ENOUGH
PROOF
IT
WAS
THERE
FOR
JUST
A
TAD
BIT
MORE
WELL
YES
AND
NO
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
ARE
PROPAGANDA
AND
IT
IS
THEREFORE
DIFFICULT
TO
DETERMINE
PRECISELY
WHAT
MADDISON
ETC
WERE
UP
TO
FROM
THEM
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
WAYS
TO
LOOK
AT
THEM
ONE
IS
WE
WANT
YOU
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
CONSTITUTION
SO
WELL
SAY
ANYTHING
THAT
WE
THINK
WILL
APPEAL
TO
YOU
OR
THE
MORE
STRAIGHTFORWARD
THIS
IS
WHY
WE
THINK
WHAT
WEVE
SUGGESTED
IN
THIS
CONSTITUTION
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
YOU
CLEARLY
CONSIDER
THE
FORMER
TO
BE
THE
PRIMARY
SITUATION
THEY
CERTAINLY
EMPHASISED
A
LIMITED
ROLE
FOR
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
BUT
THIS
WAS
NOT
NECESSARILY
THEIR
TRUE
POSITION
WELL
I
KNOW
HAMILTON
WAS
A
DYED
IN
THE
WOOL
MONARCHIST
AND
PROBABLY
THE
AUTHORITARIAN
EXTREME
TO
JEFFERSONS
DEMOCRATIC
IMPULES
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
SUGGEST
AS
A
MEANS
OF
DETERMINING
THEIR
OPINIONS
ON
THE
GOVERNMENT
IF
WE
DONT
CONSIDER
WHAT
THEY
WROTE
ABOUT
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
IS
WRITING
IN
SUPPORT
OF
SOMETHING
AUTOMATICALLY
PROPOGANDA
TO
THE
POINT
WE
MUST
ASSUME
IT
IS
UNTRUE
OR
THAT
THEY
ARE
SAYING
WHAT
THEY
DONT
BELIEVE
AND
LIKE
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
WHICH
IT
IS
COPIED
FROM
IT
WAS
GIVEN
PRETTY
WIDE
POWERS
UNFORTUNATELY
THEY
STARTED
TO
USE
THEM
AND
THUS
THE
GRIDLOCK
SET
IN
I
WASNT
AWARE
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
HAD
WIDE
POWERS
I
WAS
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
IS
WAS
PRETTY
POWERLESS
COMPARED
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
COMMONS
AND
CERTAINLY
DIDNT
HAVE
ALMOST
EQUAL
THEIR
POWERS
THE
SENATE
IS
RESTRICTED
ONLY
THAT
IT
MAY
NOT
INTRODUCE
BILLS
RELATING
TO
RAISING
REVENUE
THE
SENATE
WAS
LESS
POWERFUL
THAN
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
IN
THE
PERIOD
IN
QUESTION
IF
THE
SENATE
WAS
LESS
POWERFUL
THAN
THE
HOUSE
OF
LORDS
THAN
WED
ALMOST
HAVE
TO
STATE
THAT
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
WAS
ALSO
IN
FACT
THEY
BOTH
WERE
BECAUSE
THE
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
HAD
MUCH
GREATER
POWER
THAN
DID
THE
AMERICAN
SYSTEM
MY
READING
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
OTHER
WRITINGS
GIVES
ME
ABSOLUTELY
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THE
SENATE
WASNT
INTENDED
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
THEIR
LAWMAKING
POWERS
IN
FACT
GRIDLOCK
APPEARS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
DESIGNED
INTO
THE
SYSTEM
WITH
THE
SENATE
BEING
A
MORE
DELIBERATIVE
BODY
TO
ACT
AS
A
CHECK
ON
THE
MOREOFTEN
ELECTED
HOUSE
THE
SYSTEM
IS
MEANT
TO
BE
SLOW
TO
REACT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
IT
ENDED
UP
A
BIT
TOO
SLOW
I
DISAGREE
THE
SYSTEM
IS
NOT
TOO
SLOW
IT
WAS
SIMPLY
DESIGNED
TO
HANDLE
LESS
THAN
IT
HAS
DEMANDED
THAT
IT
HANDLE
AS
SOMEBODY
IN
WASHINGTON
PUT
IT
WHOSE
NAME
I
FORGET
CONGRESS
HAS
BECOME
EVERYBODYS
CITY
COUNCIL
CONGRESS
IS
MORE
THAN
CAPABLE
OF
QUICK
ACTION
AND
HAS
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
POWER
AND
TIME
ON
ITS
HANDS
IF
IT
CONFINED
ITSELF
TO
WHAT
ITS
ORIGINAL
JURISIDICTION
WAS
AND
ALLOWED
MORE
LOCAL
AUTONOMY
IT
IS
NOT
A
CASE
OF
THE
SYSTEM
OF
GOVERNMENT
THEY
CREATED
FAILING
BUT
THAT
IT
IS
OPERATING
UNDER
A
SET
OF
CONDITIONS
THEY
SPECIFICALLY
WANTED
TO
AVOID
NAMELY
A
CONCENTRATION
OF
POWER
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THEN
THAT
THE
PROPER
THING
TO
DO
IS
NOT
TO
REDUCE
THE
POWER
OF
EITHER
HOUSE
IN
SOME
ATTEMPT
TO
GREASE
THE
WHEELS
ALL
YOULL
GET
THEN
IS
A
SYSTEM
WHICH
MOVES
QUICKER
TO
DO
STUPID
THINGS
IT
WOULD
MAKE
MORE
SENSE
TO
MAKE
MORE
DECISIONS
AT
A
LOCAL
LEVEL
ON
WHAT
BASIS
DO
YOU
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
SENATE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
SOME
SORT
OF
RUBBERSTAMP
FOR
THE
HOUSE
YOULL
NOTE
THAT
WHILE
THE
PRESIDENTS
VETO
MAY
BE
OVERRIDDEN
THE
HOUSE
CANT
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
A
VETO
BY
THE
SENATE
THE
PRESIDENT
VETO
WAS
MEANT
TO
BE
ENTIRELY
SEPARATE
UNTIL
BUSH
ABUSED
IT
IN
A
QUITE
EXTRAORDINARY
MANNER
IT
WAS
USED
MORE
IN
ACCORD
WITH
THE
INTENT
OF
BEING
A
CHECK
ON
UNREASONABLE
LEGISLATION
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
HOW
BUSH
ABUSED
THE
VETO
IN
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
MANNER
THE
VETO
WAS
CLEARLY
REGARDED
AS
A
COMPLETELY
LAST
GASP
MEASURE
ITS
USE
WAS
MEANT
TO
BE
RESTRICTED
TO
PREVENTING
THE
LEGISLATURE
INTERFERING
WITH
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
EXECUTIVE
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
WHERE
ANY
RESTRICTIONS
IMPLIED
OR
OTHERWISE
WERE
PLACED
ON
THE
VETO
IT
COULD
JUST
AS
EASILY
HAVE
BEEN
READ
AS
A
MEANS
TO
PUT
A
CHECK
ON
DEMOCRATICALLY
POPULAR
BUT
UNWISE
IN
THE
EXECUTIVES
OPINION
POLICIES
THERE
IS
NO
LIMIT
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
TO
THE
PRESIDENTS
VETO
POWER
REGARDING
WHAT
A
BILL
IS
FOR
PREVIOUS
PRESIDENTS
HAVE
USED
THE
VETO
FOR
ANY
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
MOST
USUALLY
HAVING
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THEIR
AGENDA
I
AM
REALLY
CURIOUS
HOW
YOU
SINGLE
BUSH
OUT
AS
THE
PRESIDENT
WHO
ABUSED
VETOS
THE
SENATE
IS
NOT
MEANT
TO
BE
EXACTLY
A
RUBBER
STAMP
BODY
IT
IS
MEANT
AS
A
CHECK
ON
UNRESTRAINED
LEGISLATION
THAT
IS
THE
EXTRA
MEASURE
BUILT
INTO
THE
CONSTITUTION
IN
FAVOUR
OF
THE
STATUS
QUO
OF
THE
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
STATES
IS
NOT
A
REASONABLE
RESTRICTION
WHY
IS
IT
NOT
A
REASONABLE
RESTRICTION
BECAUSE
SENATORS
IS
THE
MAGIC
HOLY
NUMBER
UPON
WHICH
LAWS
MUST
BE
BASED
IF
SENATORS
FEEL
SAFE
ENOUGH
WITH
THEIR
STATE
CONSTITUENCIES
TO
STAND
UP
AND
FILLIBUSTER
ISNT
THAT
ENOUGH
TO
INDICATE
THERES
A
SUFFICIENT
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHETHER
A
LAW
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
OR
NOT
TO
REEVALUATE
IT
WHY
ONE
EARTH
SHOULD
BE
SUFFICIENT
TO
ENACT
A
LAW
WHICH
COVERS
MILLION
PEOPLE
IN
VERY
VERY
DIVERSE
PLACES
AND
LIVING
IN
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
CONDITIONS
WHY
SHOULDNT
A
SUPERMAJORITY
BE
REQUIRED
ANY
SYSTEM
IN
WHICH
THE
SIMPLE
MAJORITY
IS
GIVEN
ABSOLUTE
POWER
TO
IGNORE
THE
MINORITY
THEN
THE
MINORITY
WILL
BE
IGNORED
I
DO
NOT
SEE
THIS
AS
A
POSITIVE
THING
AND
FOR
ALL
THAT
IM
SURE
THE
REPUBLICANS
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
PORK
AS
MUCH
AS
THE
DEMOCRATS
THEYVE
GOT
SOME
LEGITIMATE
OBJECTIONS
TO
THE
LEGISLATION
