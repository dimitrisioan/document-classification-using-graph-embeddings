what
i
see
is
that
the
media
is
reasonably
fair
but
is
seen
as
liberal
by
conservatives
and
conservative
by
liberals
not
that
i
think
anyone
cares
but
this
pattern
using
other
examples
of
course
was
discussed
years
ago
by
aristotle
in
nicomacheanethics
note
that
you
cant
use
this
insight
to
reason
backwards
eg
since
the
conservatives
see
the
media
as
liberal
and
the
liberals
see
the
media
as
conservative
the
media
are
fair
though
ive
seen
this
reasoning
