why
did
ford
go
to
the
trouble
of
pardoning
him
if
he
did
nothing
wrong
duh
garrett
you
ignorant
slut
read
up
on
watergate
so
are
all
you
guys
so
unarticulate
that
you
all
must
must
call
names
are
none
of
you
above
gradeschool
levels
in
intelligence
jesus
garret
havent
you
ever
watched
saturday
night
live
not
only
are
you
a
historical
ignoramus
but
you
are
also
a
cultural
ignoramus
what
does
saturday
night
live
have
to
do
with
anything
when
they
make
fun
of
someone
they
do
it
with
a
little
bit
of
creativity
and
talent
you
on
the
other
hand
have
a
complete
lack
of
creativity
talent
and
verbal
mechanics
and
if
you
think
that
snl
is
culture
then
it
just
shows
where
your
intellectual
level
is
what
is
generally
accepted
is
that
nixon
attempted
to
cover
up
the
break
in
after
it
occurred
it
was
actions
in
pursuit
of
that
end
that
he
was
pardoned
for
you
of
course
are
so
ignorant
of
history
that
you
think
that
he
was
involved
in
the
break
in
i
guess
that
makes
you
even
dumber
than
me
then
because
he
was
officially
accused
of
alot
more
than
that
let
me
list
it
for
you
obstructing
justice
as
part
of
the
coverup
granted
abusing
his
presidential
powers
to
do
the
coverup
only
in
part
lets
not
forget
that
nixon
personally
authorized
the
breakin
of
ellsbergs
psychiatrist
subverting
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
i
challenge
you
to
provided
any
evidence
that
nicon
was
officially
accused
of
thi
if
nothing
else
its
meaningless
how
can
you
subvert
someones
constitutional
rights
the
verb
doesnt
go
with
the
noun
tell
that
to
the
house
that
was
the
charge
or
are
you
going
to
challenge
me
on
that
as
well
subverting
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
has
nothing
to
do
with
coveringup
for
watergate
you
have
been
proved
wrong
again
but
i
dont
expect
you
to
believe
this
since
your
arrogance
has
replaced
your
reason
and
willfully
disobeying
lawful
subpoenas
for
white
house
records
and
tapes
part
of
the
coverup
granted
garrett
please
note
that
every
charge
you
mention
except
for
the
one
that
has
no
english
meaning
was
part
of
the
coverup
wrong
again
you
forgot
about
ellsberg
btw
why
od
you
think
he
tried
to
cover
it
up
loyalty
to
people
who
worked
for
him
this
would
be
funny
if
it
werent
so
sad
that
you
actually
believe
this
in
his
loyalty
he
allowed
the
people
who
worked
for
him
to
take
the
rap
while
he
idly
sat
by
and
let
it
happen
if
he
really
was
loyal
to
the
people
who
worked
for
them
he
would
have
pardoned
them
before
he
resigned
death
to
all
modifiers
he
declared
one
day
and
out
of
garrett
johnson
every
letter
that
passed
through
his
hands
went
every
garrettingrescom
adverb
and
adjective
the
next
day
he
made
war
on
articles
the
following
day
he
blacked
out
everything
in
the
letters
but
a
an
and
the
