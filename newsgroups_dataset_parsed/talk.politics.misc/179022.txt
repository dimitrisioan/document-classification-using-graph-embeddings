GREG
HENNESSY
WRITES
CLAYTON
CRAMER
WRITES
COMPARED
TO
THE
TABLE
I
HAVE
ALREADY
POSTED
FROM
MASTERS
JOHNSON
AND
KOLODNY
SHOWING
MALE
HOMOSEXUAL
PARTNERS
IT
IS
APPARENT
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
ARE
DRAMATICALLY
MORE
PROMISCUOUS
THAN
THE
GENERAL
MALE
POPULATION
DID
YOU
EVER
CONSIDER
THE
SELECTION
EFFECT
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ARE
WILLING
TO
ADMIT
TO
BEING
A
MEMBER
SEXUAL
MINORITY
HOMOSEXUALITY
ARE
MORE
WILLING
TO
ADMIT
TO
BEING
A
MEMBER
OF
ANOTHER
SEXUAL
MINORITY
HIGHLY
PROMISCIOUS
I
DIDNT
THINK
THAT
YOU
DID
GREG
HENNESSY
UNIVERSITY
OF
VIRGINIA
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
MR
CRAMER
HAS
THE
ABILITY
TO
TAKE
THE
LEAP
OF
FAITH
I
HAVE
LISTENED
TO
SEVERAL
OF
THE
MEN
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
STUDY
AND
EVEN
THEY
CLAIM
THAT
THE
MEN
INVOLVED
WILL
NOT
TELL
THE
WHOLE
TRUTH
I
PUT
LITTLE
VALUE
IN
EXTRAPOLATING
FROM
THESE
TYPES
OF
STUDIES
OR
SURVEYS
THEY
HAVE
LIMITED
SUBSETS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
AND
THERE
IS
ALOT
OF
SKEWING
DUE
TO
IMPROPER
SELECTION
METHODS
AND
THE
BIAS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
STUDIES
ON
BOTH
SIDES
SUBJECT
AND
RESEARCHER
WOULD
YOU
ADMIT
TO
BE
PART
OF
A
GROUP
THAT
WAS
NOT
VERY
WELL
LIKED
WOULD
YOU
ADMIT
TO
HAVING
HAD
SEX
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLE
AT
SOME
CONSIDERED
ABNORMAL
RATE
THIS
APPLIES
TO
HETEROSEXUAL
MEN
IN
FACT
AS
ONE
GAY
MAN
AND
ONE
STRAIGHT
MAN
PUT
IT
MEN
LIE
ABOUT
THE
NUMBER
OF
PARTNERS
BECAUSE
THATS
THE
THING
TO
DO
OUR
CULTURE
FOR
THE
MALE
ALMOST
REQUIRES
THIS
TYPE
OF
RESPONSE
IT
MAY
SEEM
HARMLESS
AND
SILLY
BUT
CARRIES
A
LARGE
EMOTIONAL
AND
MENTAL
PRICE
TAG
I
HEAR
COLLEGE
MALE
STUDENTS
EVERYDAY
TALKING
ABOUT
THEIR
SUPPOSED
CONQUEST
THEY
JUST
HAVE
TO
LOOK
GOOD
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
AT
LEAST
IN
THEIR
EYES
BUT
ALSO
KNOW
THAT
ALOT
OF
THIS
DOES
GO
ON
THERE
ARE
MANY
COLLEGE
MALES
HETERO
HAVING
A
LOT
OF
SEX
WITH
DIFFERENT
PARTNERS
