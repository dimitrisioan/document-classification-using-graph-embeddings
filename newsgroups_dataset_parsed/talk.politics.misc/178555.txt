the
question
i
think
then
becomes
do
we
the
general
public
need
the
train
i
certainly
do
not
nor
will
i
ever
need
this
train
in
lubbock
texas
with
the
inexpensive
air
travel
provided
between
dallas
and
houston
i
dont
think
people
in
dallas
or
houston
need
it
either
i
totally
agree
really
the
only
people
this
is
going
to
benefit
are
those
who
live
in
the
cities
where
the
train
stops
who
wants
to
drive
to
the
train
station
from
x
lubbock
for
example
its
probably
farther
to
drive
to
the
train
station
than
it
is
to
the
nearest
national
airport
i
really
cant
see
spending
billion
on
a
system
that
only
three
cities
will
benefit
from
