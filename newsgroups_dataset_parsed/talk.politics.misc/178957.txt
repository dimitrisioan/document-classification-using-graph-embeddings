eliminate
the
transport
wrong
we
need
its
capability
sure
it
has
its
problems
if
you
read
aviation
week
the
line
can
be
reopened
and
the
would
be
delivered
a
year
earlier
and
cost
a
billion
less
for
the
program
politically
though
the
is
popular
pork
i
do
read
av
week
and
dont
remember
this
could
you
supply
the
date
of
the
magazine
aviation
week
march
the
cbo
estimates
that
matching
the
capability
of
would
require
at
a
total
cost
of
billion
this
option
is
still
more
than
billion
cheaper
than
completing
the
program
which
the
cbo
estimates
will
cost
billion
sorry
i
was
nine
billion
off
the
would
be
ten
billion
cheaper
as
for
vs
the
cant
carry
as
much
but
has
more
capability
read
can
land
at
smaller
airfields
of
which
there
are
more
of
than
the
now
is
the
pork
it
depends
on
whether
your
job
relies
on
it
or
not
in
california
right
now
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
pork
since
due
to
peace
dividend
so
many
people
are
out
of
work
well
california
voted
overwhelmingly
for
change
right
the
argument
to
continue
military
programs
just
to
support
jobs
is
a
poor
one
its
kept
quite
a
few
bases
open
that
should
have
been
closed
years
ago
wasting
billions
of
taxes
the
question
is
whether
les
aspin
and
clinton
will
be
able
to
face
down
a
pork
happy
