the
difference
in
the
litigation
environment
is
reflected
in
the
fees
lack
of
defensive
medicine
and
nearabsence
of
malpractice
is
really
why
we
spend
less
using
the
most
expensive
approach
of
pure
insurance
and
maybe
thats
not
such
a
good
thing
i
also
read
somewhere
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
in
canada
to
litigate
against
the
health
systemclass
action
suits
are
nearly
impossible
and
you
cant
sue
the
provincial
health
officials
at
all
since
our
doctors
are
private
and
the
system
is
just
an
insurance
plan
litigation
would
not
involve
the
insurance
fund
our
lawyers
do
not
work
on
contingency
so
that
if
you
were
to
sue
for
malpractice
then
youd
better
be
sure
of
winning
to
cover
your
fees
likewise
if
you
were
a
doctor
and
subject
of
a
suit
its
time
to
sweat
since
the
provincial
wings
of
the
cma
are
the
ones
that
go
to
bat
when
the
fee
schedule
hikes
are
presented
the
politicallybent
doctors
were
just
cackling
when
they
realized
the
cma
would
grow
in
strength
rather
than
diminish
especially
when
unopposed
unlike
in
socialized
medicine
approaches
like
britains
national
health
service
oh
no
dont
let
the
ama
know
about
this
they
have
enough
power
as
it
is
ask
most
americans
whether
theyd
like
the
doctors
lobby
to
get
more
powerful
a
few
weeks
ago
the
president
of
the
canadian
ma
wrote
a
letter
to
the
nyt
to
decry
a
lobbyists
advert
repeating
the
same
old
trash
this
is
significant
because
the
ama
and
the
cma
are
interlinked
organizations
and
he
would
not
have
done
it
without
the
approval
of
his
ama
cronies
well
yeah
tell
us
about
the
national
defense
medical
centre
outside
ottawa
theoretically
its
limited
to
service
personnel
but
some
studies
ive
heard
about
have
suggested
that
about
half
the
patients
there
are
civilians
who
not
only
have
connections
but
arent
urgent
at
all
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
bethesda
naval
hospital
since
not
all
hospitals
can
provide
everything
maybe
they
have
some
stuff
that
others
dont
ottawas
population
is
only
a
quarter
million
if
you
include
the
surrounding
counties
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospitals
annual
budgets
are
approved
by
the
government
how
do
you
keep
political
considerations
out
of
medical
decisions
i
bet
that
if
youre
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friends
with
one
youre
put
on
any
hospitals
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
youre
someone
who
gets
bumped
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
people
of
influence
will
get
their
way
in
any
system
american
or
european
its
the
golden
rule
he
who
has
the
gold
makes
the
rules
as
for
annual
budgets
those
are
actually
annual
grants
for
facilities
eg
mops
pans
etc
given
to
hospitals
of
which
most
are
private
nonprofit
foundations
btw
i
have
no
problem
with
having
aggressive
forprofit
hospitals
like
the
french
who
use
our
approach
but
in
the
paris
region
they
have
almost
as
many
people
as
canada
does
so
their
market
is
much
more
diverse
the
rest
has
to
be
made
up
for
by
billings
from
patients
who
use
their
services
wouldnt
national
health
insurance
mean
that
americans
who
are
now
fully
insured
might
have
to
settle
for
less
in
canada
provincial
insurance
covers
all
health
costs
except
dental
care
eyeglasses
prescription
drugs
ambulance
service
and
private
hospital
rooms
so
many
canadians
do
end
up
buying
some
private
insurance
a
policy
to
cover
all
of
these
things
runs
about
to
a
month
hmm
how
much
difference
would
it
make
in
the
figure
of
percentage
of
gnp
spent
on
health
care
if
dentistry
and
optometry
were
included
in
the
accounting
maybe
canada
spends
proportionately
just
as
much
on
health
care
as
we
do
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
and
are
compiled
use
the
same
methods
by
the
oecd
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
so
what
happens
if
the
health
care
systems
financially
collapse
how
they
are
collecting
premiums
and
im
an
advocate
of
having
copayments
like
the
french
do
in
their
system
in
order
to
make
it
look
more
like
the
real
insurance
that
it
is
the
private
doctors
and
hospitals
will
still
be
there
after
the
insurance
hypothically
disappears
as
they
were
there
before
it
appeared
bob
rae
the
second
least
popular
man
in
ontario
warned
ontarians
a
few
years
ago
that
if
they
didnt
stop
crossborder
shopping
in
such
huge
numbers
the
services
they
expect
from
the
province
just
wont
be
there
in
a
few
years
for
one
thing
i
think
that
bob
rae
is
an
idiot
he
didnt
say
so
but
i
knew
he
meant
the
ohip
most
of
ohip
comes
from
separate
premiums
on
your
paycheck
if
you
are
a
player
he
wants
to
spend
our
money
on
other
things
than
the
health
insurance
our
high
taxes
are
high
for
other
spending
but
health
insurance
which
is
separate
and
optional
and
it
is
being
spent
in
a
nonpartisan
manner
by
every
party
ohip
is
just
a
health
insurance
plan
it
does
not
provide
any
kind
of
health
care
that
is
up
to
you
and
your
private
doctors
would
the
private
insurers
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
obligation
to
of
course
they
could
eventually
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loathe
to
do
so
and
out
of
practice
in
handling
such
basic
services
too
some
of
the
companies
providing
extra
insurance
are
subsidiaries
of
american
companies
and
their
parents
provide
full
insurance
down
here
regardless
all
firms
up
north
can
easily
turn
on
cable
tv
to
see
how
well
the
american
firms
are
doing
by
being
involved
in
basic
coverage
the
private
firms
are
making
too
much
money
after
having
gotten
rid
of
basic
coverage
they
run
around
patting
them
selves
on
the
back
for
their
own
cooperation
in
providing
extras
for
those
people
who
deserve
it
when
private
insurance
realized
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risks
involved
in
basic
insurance
eg
neurosurgery
versus
deluxe
amenities
eg
having
to
call
granada
tv
to
replace
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someones
private
hospital
room
they
started
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
social
responsibility
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
private
insurers
publicly
warned
against
any
thoughts
of
privatizing
routine
low
cost
parts
of
that
provinces
public
health
insurance
plan
again
i
doubt
americans
would
like
giving
the
insurance
companies
that
much
power
i
half
wonder
if
the
canadian
health
insurers
didnt
go
along
with
the
provinces
and
the
federal
government
years
ago
because
they
knew
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
the
public
system
going
bust
in
the
long
run
and
then
afterwards
they
could
clean
up
okay
this
sort
of
contradicts
what
i
said
higher
up
but
its
another
possibility
theyd
have
an
added
bonus
when
arguing
against
government
involvement
in
their
industryas
they
could
then
point
to
its
failure
instead
of
just
citing
theoretical
principles
i
agree
they
were
in
a
winwin
situation
but
right
now
it
seems
that
they
have
won
bigger
when
you
look
at
how
full
their
coffers
are
friends
from
my
sisters

class

being
