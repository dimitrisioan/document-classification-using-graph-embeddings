GARY
L
DARE
WRITES
AGAIN
THEY
CANT
FORCE
A
PRIVATE
ENTITY
TO
SPRING
TO
LIFE
TO
PAY
THEM
SO
THE
GOVERNMENT
BY
SHEER
ECONOMIC
FORCE
HAS
BASICALLY
CLEARED
THE
BASICCARE
MARKET
FOR
ITSELF
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
TEST
THIS
WOULD
BE
FOR
SOME
REALLY
DARING
PERSON
TO
START
UP
FROM
SCRATCH
IN
ALBERTA
ANDOR
QUEBEC
A
HEALTH
INSURANCE
COMPANY
OFFERING
BASIC
CARE
CRAZY
YES
BUT
THATS
ALMOST
HOW
MCI
GOT
STARTED
HOWEVER
THE
CONCEPT
OF
RISKS
IS
WELL
KNOWN
BY
INSURANCE
ACTUARIES
AND
NO
PRIVATE
FIRM
CAN
GET
THE
KIND
OF
AMORTIZATION
THAT
THE
PUBLIC
POOLS
CAN
GET
AND
SINCE
HEALTH
INSURANCE
GETS
SPENT
THAT
DOESNT
SIT
WELL
WITH
THE
INSURANCE
CEOS
AND
YOU
GET
A
SITUATION
LIKE
IN
THE
US
WHERE
RATES
KEEP
GOING
UP
TO
CATCH
UP
SEE
WHAT
I
MEAN
ITS
A
GOVERNMENT
MONOPOLY
SURE
BECAUSE
ITS
A
NONMARKET
PHENOMENOM
AND
THE
FREE
MARKET
CANT
SOLVE
IT
EVEN
OUR
PRIVATE
INSURANCE
SAYS
THAT
AND
REMEMBER
LAST
YEAR
QUEBEC
PROPOSED
GIVING
THE
LEAST
RISKY
PARTS
OF
BASIC
CARE
TO
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
AND
THEY
BALKED
LIKE
YOU
SAIDWHY
SHOULD
THEY
AND
WANTS
NO
PART
OF
IT
BY
YOUR
OWN
ARGUMENTS
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
THE
PROVINCIAL
PLAN
YOURE
BASICALLY
UP
A
CREEK
YES
BUT
IN
OUR
CULTURE
ARGUING
AGAINST
IT
IS
LIKE
ARGUING
FOR
NATIONAL
DEFENCE
BY
MEANS
OF
WARLORDS
TRUE
ACCORDING
TO
POLLS
IVE
READ
USUALLY
IN
THE
SORT
OF
SIMPLEMINDED
STUFF
YOU
WERE
INITALLY
RESPONDING
TO
SOMETHING
LIKE
OF
AMERICANS
WOULD
LIKE
CANADIANSTYLE
HEALTH
CARE
WHEREAS
ONLY
OF
CANADIANS
WOULD
LIKE
IT
OUR
WAY
ID
BE
INTERESTED
TO
KNOW
WHY
THERE
ARE
THAT
MANY
OF
CANADAS
POPULATION
IS
ABOUT
A
MILLION
OR
SO
PEOPLE
CANADA
IS
SATURATED
BY
AMERICAN
MEDIA
WHILE
PUNDITS
COME
ON
CABLE
AND
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
AWFUL
OUR
HEALTH
CARE
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
WHAT
PEOPLE
EXPERIENCE
UP
NORTH
ENDS
UP
NOT
DIFFERING
FROM
WHAT
THEY
SEE
PORTRAYED
ON
AMERICAN
TELEVISION
IN
MOVIES
IE
SAME
INFRASTRUCTURE
DIFFERENT
INSURANCE
MAKEUP
YET
THEY
KNOW
NOT
OF
ANY
INSURANCE
PROBLEMS
AND
HAVE
NO
IDEA
OF
WHAT
AN
HMO
IS
BUT
HAVING
LOTS
OF
BRITISH
TV
AS
WELL
THEY
KNOW
THAT
THEY
DONT
LIKE
NHS
SOMEONE
MUST
HAVE
A
REASON
TO
ARGUE
AGAINST
IT
VALID
OR
NOTWHAT
KIND
OF
PEOPLE
ARE
THEY
THE
POLLS
THAT
YOU
REFER
TO
FOR
THE
CANADIAN
DATA
ARE
FROM
THE
ANNUAL
JULY
POLLS
CONDUCTED
FOR
MACLEANS
OUR
MAJOR
ENGLISH
NEWSMAGAZINE
BY
DECIMA
RESEARCH
DECIMA
PRESIDENT
ALLEN
GREGG
IS
CONSIDERED
ONE
OF
THE
WORLDS
TOP
POLL
RESEARCHERS
AND
MULRONEYS
CONSERVATIVES
HAVE
RELIED
ON
HIM
TO
KEEP
IN
POWER
IN
THE
FACE
OF
IMPOSSIBLE
ELECTION
SITUATIONS
THE
AMERICAN
POLLS
ARE
HARRIS
POLLS
AND
HAVE
BEEN
REPOSTED
ON
USENET
A
FEW
TIMES
AND
PROBABLY
WILL
AGAIN
IM
SORTA
SUSPICIOUS
MYSELF
COS
MAYBE
AMERICANS
WANT
UNIVERSAL
COVERAGE
LIKE
CANADA
I
HONESTLY
DOUBT
THAT
MOST
AMERICANS
REALIZE
THAT
WE
HAVE
PRIVATE
DOCTORS
AND
PUBLIC
AND
PRIVATE
HOSPITALS
IE
SIMILIAR
HEALTH
CARE
INFRASTRUCTURE
AND
OUR
SYSTEM
IS
BASICALLY
PURE
INSURANCE
WITHOUT
HMOS
GIVEN
RECENT
TURNAROUNDS
BY
THE
HIAA
ENDORSING
UNIVERSAL
COVERAGE
AND
HOSTILITY
TO
CORPORATIST
HMOS
WITHIN
THE
AMA
AND
THE
COMPLETE
SILENCE
VIS
A
VIS
CANADABASHING
BY
THE
AMA
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THEYRE
KEEPING
THE
SECRET
ABOUT
CANADA
UP
THEIR
SLEEVE
EXACTLY
WOULDNT
YOU
UNTIL
THE
IDEA
OF
MANAGED
COMPETITION
AROSE
THERE
WAS
NO
DIRECT
THREAT
TO
STANDALONE
PRIVATE
PRACTICE
IN
THE
THE
AMA
FOUGHT
HMOS
AS
CORPORATIZED
SOCIALIST
MEDICINE
PART
OF
THE
REASON
WHY
WE
HAVE
ONLY
INSURANCE
AND
NO
HMOS
IN
CANADA
COS
THAT
WAS
PART
OF
THE
DEAL
CUT
WITH
THE
CMA
IVE
ALSO
READ
THAT
THE
THREE
BIGGEST
AMERICAN
HMOS
CAN
BE
COMPARED
STRAIGHT
UP
AGAINST
SOME
OF
THE
SMALLER
CANADIAN
PROVINCES
IN
THE
MARITIMES
AND
THEY
SPEND
SOMETHING
LIKE
LESS
PER
PATIENT
MAYBE
IT
DOES
HELP
THE
AMERICAN
HMOS
CAN
STILL
CREAM
AND
THEY
PROBABLY
COVER
A
SMALLER
GEOGRAPHIC
AREA
THAN
EVEN
OUR
SMALLEST
PROVINCES
GEOGRAPHY
AGAIN
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
SPREAD
OUT
ACROSS
THE
WHOLE
COUNTRY
I
THINK
BUT
EACH
SITE
IS
PROBABLY
COMPACT
AND
THE
CLIENTELE
ARE
CREAMED
AND
DONT
FORGET
THAT
HMOS
PLACE
CAPS
ON
YOUR
COVERAGE
AND
OFTEN
WONT
TELL
YOU
ABOUT
ADDITIONAL
PROCEDURES
YOU
COULD
GET
OTHERWISE
DESPITE
THAT
YOU
MIGHT
BE
WILLING
TO
PAY

IT
