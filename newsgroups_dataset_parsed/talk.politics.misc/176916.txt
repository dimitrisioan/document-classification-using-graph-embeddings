see

you
agree
that
the
current
government
is
reticent
about
admitting
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
speaking
from
personal
experience
i
have
had
judges
illegally
assume
jurisdiction
even
after
i
demanded
that
the
da
prove
such
jurisdiction
on
the
record
and
the
da
stood
mute
i
have
also
had
an
appellate
court
uphold
such
action
and
hide
behind
california
rules
of
court
rule
the
judges
of
the
appellate
department
shall
not
be
required
to
write
opinions
in
any

may
do
so
whenever
they
deem
it
advisable
or
in
the
public
interest
that
is
reality
