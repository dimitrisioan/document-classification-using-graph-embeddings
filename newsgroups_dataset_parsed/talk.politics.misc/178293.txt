SECRETARY
RILEY
TALKED
ABOUT
THIS
BEING
THOMAS
JEFFERSONS
BIRTHDAY
IF
THOMAS
JEFFERSON
BELIEVED
IN
ANYTHING
HE
BELIEVED
IN
THESE
THREE
THINGS
FIRST
IN
EDUCATION
SECOND
IN
REAL
PERSONAL
LIBERTY
FREEDOM
OF
RELIGION
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
FREEDOM
OF
ASSOCIATION
FREEDOM
OF
THE
PRESS
AND
THIRD
IN
THE
ABSOLUTE
IMPERATIVE
OF
CHANGING
AS
TIMES
CHANGE
IF
YOU
GO
TO
THE
JEFFERSON
MEMORIAL
HERE
IN
THIS
BEAUTIFUL
CITY
WHICH
IS
NOW
BEDECKED
WITH
ALL
OF
ITS
WONDERFUL
CHERRY
BLOSSOMS
YOU
WILL
SEE
JEFFERSON
SAYING
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
CHANGE
WITH
CHANGING
TIMES
FOR
US
HERE
IN
AMERICA
THAT
MEANS
REDUCING
OUR
DEFICIT
AND
INCREASING
OUR
INVESTMENT
AND
PUTTING
OUR
PEOPLE
FIRST
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
COMPETE
IN
THE
WORLD
WERE
HERE
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THAT
TONIGHT
ABOUT
WHAT
WE
CAN
DO
TO
EDUCATE
AND
TRAIN
OUR
PEOPLE
BETTER
UNLESS
WE
DO
THAT
NONE
OF
THE
EFFORTS
THAT
ALL
THE
REST
OF
US
MAKE
IN
GOVERNMENT
EVEN
TO
BRING
THE
BUDGET
INTO
BALANCE
EVEN
TO
INCREASE
OUR
INVESTMENT
IN
OTHER
THINGS
WHICH
WILL
GROW
JOBS
WILL
LAST
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
WE
ALSO
HAVE
TO
HAVE
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
CARRY
THEIR
LOAD
AND
IN
A
WORLD
WHERE
THE
AVERAGE
YOUNG
PERSON
WILL
CHANGE
JOBS
SEVEN
OR
EIGHT
TIMES
IN
A
LIFETIME
THAT
BEGINS
WITH
THE
EDUCATION
SYSTEM
AND
CONTINUES
INTO
THE
WORK
FORCE
WHERE
EDUCATION
MUST
GO
ON
FOR
A
LIFETIME
ITS
NOT
JUST
IMPORTANT
WHAT
YOU
KNOW
BUT
WHAT
YOU
CAN
LEARN
AND
IF
I
MIGHT
ID
LIKE
TO
CLOSE
JUST
BY
EMPHASIZING
WERE
DOING
OUR
BEST
TO
TRY
TO
HAVE
THE
MOST
INNOVATIVE
PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN
THE
LABOR
DEPARTMENT
AND
THE
EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT
AND
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
TO
BUILD
A
GOOD
SCHOOLTOWORK
TRANSITION
AND
WERE
TRYING
TO
GET
OFF
TO
A
GOOD
START
THIS
SUMMER
WITH
A
PROGRAM
THAT
WOULD
CREATE
MORE
THAN
NEW
SUMMER
JOBS
INCLUDING
MANY
THOUSANDS
THAT
HAVE
A
STRONG
EDUCATION
COMPONENT
SO
OUR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
CAN
BE
LEARNING
AND
WORKING
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
DICK
I
THINK
I
OUGHT
TO
STOP
THERE
THATS
A
GOOD
PLACE
WE
CAN
BEGIN
I
THINK
THE
DISCUSSION
SECRETARY
RILEY
THANK
YOU
SO
MUCH
MR
PRESIDENT
EACH
MONTH
WE
GET
TOGETHER
AND
TALK
ABOUT
WAYS
THAT
ALL
CITIZENS
CAN
WORK
TOWARDS
REACHING
THE
NATIONAL
EDUCATION
GOALS
AND
TONIGHT
WELL
FOCUS
ON
GOAL
FIVE
AND
HOW
COMMUNITIES
SUCH
AS
YOURS
CAN
PREPARE
STUDENTS
FOR
THIS
WORLD
OF
WORK
THIS
WEEK
THE
EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT
AND
THE
LABOR
DEPARTMENT
ARE
HOSTING
A
CONFERENCE
HERE
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
CALLED
SUMMER
CHALLENGE
A
PROGRAM
OF
WORK
AND
LEARNING
TO
AMERICAS
YOUTH
THE
AIM
IS
TO
USE
SOME
SPECIAL
FUNDS
FROM
PRESIDENT
CLINTONS
PROPOSED
ECONOMIC
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
TO
PROVIDE
EDUCATIONALLYENRICHED
JOBS
AND
SUMMER
SCHOOL
PROGRAMS
FOR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
IN
DISADVANTAGED
AREAS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
MR
PRESIDENT
LETS
TALK
A
MINUTE
YOU
ALLUDED
TO
IT
SOMEWHAT
ABOUT
THE
SUMMER
YOUTH
CHALLENGE
YOUR
PROGRAM
CALLS
FOR
MORE
EDUCATIONAL
ENRICHMENT
IN
THE
SUMMER
JOBS
AND
WHY
IN
YOUR
WORDS
IS
THAT
SO
IMPORTANT
THE
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
ITS
IMPORTANT
FOR
TWO
REASONS
FIRST
OF
ALL
A
LOT
OF
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WERE
TRYING
TO
REACH
MAY
HAVE
HAD
TROUBLE
ADJUSTING
TO
SCHOOL
AND
LEARNING
AND
WHILE
WE
WANT
THEM
TO
HAVE
A
GOOD
EXPERIENCE
WITH
A
REAL
JOB
WE
ALSO
WANT
THEM
TO
CONTINUE
TO
LEARN
DURING
THE
SUMMER
BECAUSE
WE
KNOW
FROM
A
LOT
OF
RESEARCH
THAT
A
LOT
OF
KIDS
THAT
HAVE
TROUBLE
LEARNING
IN
SCHOOL
MAY
FORGET
AS
MUCH
AS
PERCENT
OF
WHAT
THEY
LEARNED
THE
PREVIOUS
YEAR
OVER
THE
SUMMERTIME
AND
THAT
IS
A
VERY
UNPRODUCTIVE
THING
FOR
SCHOOLS
TO
HAVE
TO
TAKE
UP
A
LOT
OF
TIME
TEACHING
WHAT
THEY
ALREADY
TAUGHT
BEFORE
SECONDLY
WE
WANT
TO
HELP
THESE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
PROGRESS
NOT
ONLY
IN
TERMS
OF
WORK
BUT
IN
TERMS
OF
LEARNING
WE
WANT
TO
ABOLISH
THE
ARTIFICIAL
DIVIDING
LINE
BETWEEN
WHAT
IS
WORK
AND
WHAT
IS
LEARNING
BECAUSE
WE
THINK
THAT
THE
BEST
AND
MOST
PRODUCTIVE
WORKERS
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
LIFETIME
LEARNERS
AND
WE
THINK
THAT
THIS
EXPERIENCE
COULD
MAYBE
DRIVE
THAT
POINT
HOME
AND
PREPARE
THESE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
TO
SUCCEED
IN
SCHOOL
OR
AT
WORK
OR
IN
COLLEGE
AS
THEY
GO
ON
SECRETARY
RILEY
WELL
I
THINK
THE
FACT
THAT
THESE
ARE
DISADVANTAGED
KIDS
THAT
GAP
THAT
LAG
YOU
MENTIONED
AS
THEY
GO
INTO
THE
NEXT
YEAR
IS
REALLY
EVEN
GREATER
SECRETARY
REICH
OF
COURSE
YOU
HAVE
TRAINING
PROGRAMS
THROUGHOUT
THE
YEAR
AND
I
WONDER
IS
YOU
HAVE
ANY
COMMENT
ABOUT
THIS
EDUCATIONAL
COMPONENT
OF
TRAINING
SECRETARY
REICH
WELL
WHAT
WEVE
LEARNED
MR
SECRETARY
IS
THAT
FOR
MANY
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHETHER
ITS
FOR
THE
SUMMER
OR
FOR
THE
YEAR
ACTUALLY
ONTHEJOB
WORK
EXPERIENCE
COMBINED
WITH
EDUCATION
IS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
WAYS
OF
LEARNING
MANY
YOUNG
PEOPLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
HAVE
A
LOT
THEY
HAVE
A
DIFFICULT
TIME
LEARNING
GEOMETRY
BUT
WHEN
THEY
ACTUALLY
ARE
THERE
BUILDING
SOMETHING
OR
WORKING
ON
SOMETHING
AND
THEY
CAN
SEE
THE
EXACT
AND
DIRECT
APPLICATION
OF
GEOMETRY
THEY
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
ITS
USED
FOR
AND
A
LOT
OF
YOUNG
PEOPLE
JUST
THAT
SENSE
OF
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
EDUCATION
AND
THE
WORLD
OF
WORK
IS
TERRIBLY
TERRIBLY
IMPORTANT
ITS
IMPORTANT
DURING
THE
SUMMER
BUT
ITS
IMPORTANT
FOR
A
LOT
OF
YOUNG
PEOPLE
EVEN
BEYOND
THE
SUMMER
SECRETARY
RILEY
THANK
YOU
MR
PRESIDENT
YOUVE
CALLED
FOR
A
YOUTH
APPRENTICESHIP
PROGRAM
SCHOOLTOWORK
TRANSITION
AND
I
WONDER
IF
YOU
WOULD
TELL
US
A
LITTLE
BIT
ABOUT
YOUR
CONCEPT
OF
THAT
AND
HOW
YOU
SEE
IT
DEVELOPING
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
FIRST
OF
ALL
LETS
TALK
ABOUT
WHY
ITS
IMPORTANT
MOST
NEW
JOBS
THAT
WILL
BE
CREATED
IN
THIS
DECADE
WILL
NOT
REQUIRE
A
FOURYEAR
COLLEGE
DEGREE
BUT
MOST
OF
THEM
WILL
REQUIRE
SOME
LEARNING
AND
SKILLS
THAT
GO
WELL
BEYOND
WHAT
MOST
PEOPLE
GET
IN
A
HIGH
SCHOOL
DIPLOMA
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
LAST
YEARS
THE
AVERAGE
SALARIES
OF
YOUNG
PEOPLE
THAT
HAD
AT
LEAST
TWO
YEARS
OF
GOOD
POSTHIGH
SCHOOL
EDUCATION
WAS
A
GOOD
SALARY
THAT
WENT
UP
OVER
THE
DECADE
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
LESS
THAN
THAT
TENDED
TO
HAVE
LOWER
WAGES
THAT
DID
NOT
GO
UP
AND
IN
MANY
CASES
IN
REAL
TERMS
FELL
OVER
THE
DECADE
BECAUSE
THEY
WERENT
PRODUCTIVE
THEY
WERENT
MORE
VALUABLE
TO
THEIR
EMPLOYERS
SO
WE
THINK
AMERICA
HAS
A
BIG
ECONOMIC
INTEREST
IN
TRYING
TO
ENSURE
THAT
ALL
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
GET
OUT
OF
HIGH
SCHOOL
BUT
DONT
GO
ON
TO
COLLEGE
MAKE
A
TRANSITION
TO
WORK
WHICH
INCLUDES
TWO
YEARS
OF
FURTHER
TRAINING
EITHER
IN
A
COMMUNITY
COLLEGE
A
VOCATIONAL
SETTING
OR
PERHAPS
ON
THE
JOB
AND
WHAT
I
HAVE
DONE
IN
THIS
BUDGET
AS
YOU
KNOW
IS
TO
GIVE
YOU
AND
SECRETARY
REICH
SOME
FUNDS
AND
SOME
INCENTIVES
TO
TRY
TO
WORK
IN
PARTNERSHIP
WITH
STATES
AND
WITH
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
TO
BUILD
THESE
PROGRAMS
STATEBYSTATE
IN
A
WAY
THAT
WOULD
BE
CUSTOMIZED
ESSENTIALLY
BY
THE
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
BASED
ON
THE
NEEDS
OF
THE
ECONOMY
IN
ANY
GIVEN
AREA
IT
COULD
REVOLUTIONIZE
LONGTERM
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
AMERICAN
WORK
FORCE
AND
THE
EARNINGS
OF
AMERICAN
WORKERS
SECRETARY
REICH
I
SHOULD
ADD
MR
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
YOU
KNOW
THIS
FROM
YOUR
EXPERIENCE
IN
ARKANSAS
AND
MANY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WATCHING
THIS
PROGRAM
THAT
THE
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
AND
EDUCATORS
LABOR
GROUPS
ARE
ALREADY
IN
MANY
OF
OUR
COMMUNITIES
MANY
OF
OUR
STATES
BUILDING
A
SCHOOLTOWORK
TRANSITION
PROGRAM
IN
FACT
THERES
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
FERMENT
A
LOT
OF
EXCITEMENT
THE
PEOPLE
WATCHING
THIS
PROGRAM
PROBABLY
ARE
THE
ONES
WHO
ARE
MOST
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
IN
THAT
AND
MORE
POWER
TO
THEM
SECRETARY
RILEY
AND
I
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
EVERYTHING
WE
CAN
TO
BUILD
ON
THE
SUCCESSES
ALREADY
OUT
THERE
SECRETARY
RILEY
BOB
WERE
GOING
TO
BE
TALKING
TONIGHT
ABOUT
YOUTH
APPRENTICESHIP
AND
TECH
PREP
THE
COOP
LEARNING
CAREER
ACADEMIES
AND
WHAT
FEATURES
ALL
THOSE
PROGRAMS
THAT
DEAL
WITH
THIS
SUBJECT
WHAT
ARE
SOME
OF
THE
FEATURES
THAT
EVERY
ONE
OF
THESE
SCHOOLTOWORK
PROGRAMS
MIGHT
HAVE
THAT
ARE
IMPORTANT
SECRETARY
REICH
WELL
ONE
THING
THAT
WEVE
SEEN
AND
YOU
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
WORKING
AT
THIS
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AND
YOU
MUCH
LONGER
THAN
I
WEVE
SEEN
THAT
ACTIVE
INVOLVEMENT
OF
THE
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
IS
ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL
AND
IM
SO
DELIGHTED
THAT
WERE
DOING
THIS
IN
THE
HEADQUARTERS
OF
THE
CHAMBER
OF
COMMERCE
THE
CHAMBER
OF
COMMERCE
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
IS
COMMITTED
TO
DOING
THESE
KINDS
OF
PROGRAMS
TRAINING
EDUCATION
RETRAINING
AND
WEVE
AIMED
TO
WORK
VERY
CLOSELY
WITH
THE
CHAMBER
THE
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
IS
GOING
TO
BE
ACTIVELY
ENGAGED
IN
DEVELOPING
ALMOST
AN
AUDIT
OF
THE
KIND
OF
JOBS
THAT
ARE
NEEDED
AND
HELPING
THE
EDUCATORS
COMMUNITY
COLLEGES
TECHNICAL
INSTITUTIONS
DEVELOP
CURRICULA
THAT
ARE
RELEVANT
FOR
THE
JOBS
OF
THE
FUTURE
COMMUNITIES
HAVE
GOT
TO
COME
TOGETHER
I
MEAN
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
THINGS
YOUVE
GOT
TO
HAVE
ALL
OF
THESE
PLAYERS
IN
A
COMMUNITY
COME
TOGETHER
AND
WORK
TOGETHER
AND
COOPERATE
TOGETHER
YOU
KNOW
TOO
OFTEN
WE
HAVE
THE
EDUCATORS
OVER
HERE
AND
THE
BUSINESS
LEADERS
OVER
HERE
LABOR
GROUPS
OVER
HERE
AND
EVERYBODY
IS
TALKING
BUT
THEYRE
NOT
REALLY
WORKING
TOGETHER
IN
A
COMMON
STRATEGY
AND
THE
THIRD
AND
FINAL
INGREDIENT
I
WOULD
SAY
DICK
WOULD
BE
A
COMMITMENT
TO
EXCELLENCE
A
COMMITMENT
BOTH
TO
ACADEMIC
EXCELLENCE
AND
ALSO
TO
SKILLS
DEVELOPMENT
EXCELLENCE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
TRACKING
PROGRAM
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
FOR
KIDS
WHO
ARE
NOT
GOING
TO
MAKE
IT
THIS
IS
A
PROGRAM
THAT
EVERY
YOUNG
PERSON
OUGHT
TO
BE
ELIGIBLE
FOR
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
GO
ON
BEYOND
THAT
TO
FOURYEAR
COLLEGE
THATS
FINE
THAT
OUGHT
TO
BE
PERMISSIBLE
BUT
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
LEARNING
ABOUT
JOBS
THE
FOUNDATION
SKILLS
FOR
ONTHEJOB
LEARNING
AND
AGAIN
THOSE
ARE
THE
CRITICAL
COMPONENTS
ITS
ALREADY
BEING
DONE
THE
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
IF
I
MIGHT
JUST
INTERJECT
ONE
POINT
BASED
ON
MY
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
AT
HOME
THE
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
HAS
A
CRITICAL
ROLE
TO
PLAY
NOT
SIMPLY
IN
SAYING
HERE
ARE
THE
JOB
SKILLS
THAT
ARE
NEEDED
AND
HERES
WHAT
OUGHT
TO
BE
TAUGHT
BUT
ALSO
IN
MONITORING
THAT
EXCELLENCE
IF
YOU
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
SORT
OF
PARTNERSHIP
THERE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
PAYING
THE
TAXES
AND
WHO
ARE
GOING
TO
THEN
BE
HIRING
THE
WORKERS
ARE
NOT
GOING
TO
PERMIT
THE
SECONDRATE
PROGRAMS
TO
SURVIVE
IF
THEY
HAVE
ANY
WAY
TO
SHAPE
AND
INFLUENCE
THEM
SO
I
THINK
THATS
VERY
IMPORTANT
AND
WHEN
WE
TRY
TO
IF
YOU
WILL
FILL
IN
THE
BLANKS
AT
THE
FEDERAL
LEVEL
TRYING
TO
SET
SOME
STANDARDS
AND
PROVIDE
SOME
FUNDS
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
WE
WANT
TO
BE
SURE
AND
DO
IS
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THE
EMPLOYER
HAS
A
HEAVY
AMOUNT
OF
INFLUENCE
OVER
THE
QUALITY
OF
THESE
PROGRAMS
BECAUSE
THATS
REALLY
WHATS
GOING
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
THE
WHOLE
THING
IS
WORTHWHILE
SECRETARY
RILEY
THATS
GREAT
WEVE
BEEN
TALKING
OF
COURSE
ABOUT
SCHOOLTOWORK
AND
ALSO
THE
JOBS
AND
ECONOMIC
RECOVERY
PROGRAM
FOR
THIS
SUMMER
AND
FALL
BUT
LETS
TALK
JUST
A
MOMENT
ABOUT
LONGTERM
SCHOOL
REFORM
ITS
SOMETHING
ESPECIALLY
CLOSE
TO
ME
MR
PRESIDENT
I
WONDER
IF
YOU
WOULD
GIVE
US
SOME
OF
YOUR
IDEAS
FOR
THE
COMMUNITIES
OUT
HERE
ON
GOALS
LEGISLATION
THAT
I
THINK
WILL
BE
COMING
FORTH
BEFORE
TOO
LONG
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
AS
YOU
KNOW
BACK
WHEN
YOU
AND
I
WERE
BOTH
GOVERNORS
WE
SPENT
A
LOT
OF
TIME
WORKING
ON
OUR
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
AND
WE
TRIED
TO
BE
VERY
CANDID
WITH
OUR
PEOPLE
IN
SAYING
THAT
A
LOT
OF
THESE
THINGS
WERE
GOING
TO
TAKE
SOME
TIME
TO
MATERIALIZE
I
HAD
A
HAND
IN
WRITING
THE
NATIONAL
EDUCATION
GOALS
THAT
THE
GOVERNORS
DRAFTED
ALONG
WITH
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
PRESIDENT
BUSHS
ADMINISTRATION
BACK
IN
AND
WHAT
WERE
GOING
TO
TRY
TO
DO
THIS
YEAR
WITH
YOUR
LEADERSHIP
IS
TO
INTRODUCE
LEGISLATION
IN
CONGRESS
THAT
WILL
ACTUALLY
DEFINE
THE
THINGS
THAT
THE
NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT
OUGHT
TO
DO
TO
TRY
TO
HELP
THE
LOCAL
SCHOOLS
AND
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
THE
ADULT
LEARNERS
TOO
MEET
THOSE
GOALS
MAKING
SURE
THAT
WHEN
BY
PEOPLE
SHOW
UP
FOR
SCHOOL
READY
TO
LEARN
THAT
WE
GET
A
PERCENT
ONTIME
HIGH
SCHOOL
GRADUATION
RATE
THAT
CHILDREN
AT
THE
AND
GRADES
ARE
CONFIDENT
IN
THE
SUBJECTS
THEYRE
SUPPOSED
TO
KNOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
SECOND
TO
NONE
IN
MATH
AND
SCIENCE
THAT
ARE
SCHOOLS
ARE
SAFE
DISCIPLINED
AND
DRUGFREE
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
FIFTH
GOAL
I
TOOK
THEM
OUT
OF
LINE
TO
SAY
THIS
THE
LAST
IS
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
SYSTEM
OF
LIFELONG
LEARNING
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
EACH
ONE
OF
THOSE
GOALS
THERES
A
NATIONAL
ROLE
A
STATE
ROLE
A
SCHOOL
ROLE
SCHOOL
DISTRICT
ROLE
AND
A
PRIVATE
SECTOR
ROLE
AND
WHAT
YOUVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
DO
IN
THIS
BILL
YOURE
GOING
TO
INTRODUCE
WITH
ME
IN
THE
NEXT
FEW
WEEKS
IS
TO
DEFINE
WHAT
OUR
JOB
IS
AND
THEN
TO
GIVE
THE
REST
OF
AMERICA
A
WAY
OF
DEFINING
WHAT
THEIR
JOB
IS
AND
SEEING
WHETHER
WERE
ACTUALLY
MEETING
THE
STANDARDS
OF
QUALITY
THAT
WE
NEED
TO
MEET
ITS
VERY
EXCITING
SO
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
NOTHING
QUITE
LIKE
IT
HAS
EVER
BEEN
DONE
IN
THE
FORM
OF
FEDERAL
LEGISLATION
BEFORE
NOT
MANDATING
AND
TELLING
PEOPLE
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
THEIR
MONEY
BUT
ACTUALLY
SETTING
UP
A
FRAMEWORK
FOR
EXCELLENCE
AND
PARTNERSHIPS
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
DO
OUR
JOB
IM
REALLY
EXCITED
ABOUT
IT
SECRETARY
RILEY
WELL
I
AM
TOO
AND
I
THINK
REALLY
IT
WILL
BE
AN
ENTIRELY
NEW
ROLE
FOR
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IN
TERMS
OF
ITS
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
STATES
SERVING
AS
A
PARTNER
REALLY
TO
SUPPORT
AND
FACILITATE
AND
TO
HELP
OUT
IN
THESE
EDUCATION
REFORM
EFFORTS
ALL
DRIVEN
BY
HIGH
STANDARDS
THATS
THE
POINT
BOB
LET
ME
ASK
YOU
ONE
QUESTION
AND
THEN
WELL
GET
TO
THE
TELEPHONE
CALLS
ITS
ABOUT
THE
SAME
SUBJECT
WE
HAVE
OF
COURSE
SKILLS
STANDARDS
THAT
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
PART
OF
GOALS
AND
I
WONDER
IF
YOU
WOULD
COMMENT
ON
THAT
SECRETARY
REICH
WELL
YOU
KNOW
WE
HAVE
PERCENT
OF
OUR
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
GRADUATE
FROM
COLLEGE
VERY
OFTEN
THEY
DONT
HAVE
VERY
MANY
ALTERNATIVES
THEY
DO
HAVE
A
WONDERFUL
SYSTEM
OF
COMMUNITY
COLLEGES
AND
TECHNICAL
INSTITUTIONS
BUT
IF
WE
HAD
NATIONAL
SKILL
STANDARDS
TO
WHICH
THEY
COULD
ASPIRE
AND
WHICH
EMPLOYERS
WOULD
UNDERSTAND
AS
A
NATIONAL
CREDENTIAL
MANY
OF
THESE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WOULD
ACTUALLY
FIND
THAT
THEY
WERE
MUCH
MORE
ELIGIBLE
FOR
JOBS
EVERYBODY
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
GO
TO
COLLEGE
OTHER
COUNTRIES
YOU
HAVE
SMALLER
PROPORTIONS
OF
THEIR
POPULATION
GOING
TO
COLLEGE
BUT
YOU
HAVE
A
WHOLE
LEVEL
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
CERTAIN
TECHNICAL
PREPROFESSIONAL
SKILLS
WE
CAN
DO
IT
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
IF
YOU
DONT
GO
TO
FOURYEAR
COLLEGE
YOURE
NOT
A
LOSER
AND
WE
WANT
TO
DEVELOP
THOSE
NATIONAL
SKILL
STANDARDS
WERE
GOING
TO
BE
WORKING
WITH
THE
STATES
WITH
THE
EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT
WITH
A
LOT
OF
PRIVATE
INDUSTRY
IN
DEVELOPING
THOSE
STANDARDS
AND
I
THINK
THEY
WILL
BE
THE
KINDS
OF
THINGS
THAT
ENABLE
OUR
VOCATIONAL
AND
TECHNICAL
AND
OTHER
INSTITUTIONS
TO
RALLY
AROUND
AS
WELL
AS
OUR
BUSINESS
COMMUNITY
SECRETARY
RILEY
WELL
THATS
GREAT
WHY
DONT
WE
GO
AHEAD
AND
GO
TO
THE
TELEPHONE
WE
HAVE
A
CALL
I
SEE
MAYOR
BRUCE
TODD
OF
AUSTIN
TEXAS
Q
YES
MR
PRESIDENT
AND
MR
SECRETARY
REICH
AND
RILEY
WE
CERTAINLY
APPRECIATE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
JOIN
YOU
TODAY
WE
HAVE
SOME
DEDICATED
PROFESSIONALS
AND
VOLUNTEERS
HERE
IN
AUSTIN
WHO
HAVE
HEARD
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
SAID
AND
ARE
VERY
APPRECIATIVE
LET
ME
SIMPLY
SAY
AMEN
TO
SOME
OF
THE
COMMENTS
MADE
ALREADY
WE
AGREE
WITH
MUCH
OF
THE
TONE
THAT
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
TAKEN
AND
ARE
VERY
SUPPORTIVE
WE
HAVE
BEEN
SUCCESSFUL
HERE
IN
AUSTIN
OF
TRIPLING
OUR
SUMMER
EMPLOYMENT
PROGRAM
OVER
THE
LAST
FOUR
YEARS
WE
EXPECT
TO
HAVE
OVER
EMPLOYED
THIS
YEAR
IN
THE
SUMMERTIME
PERHAPS
AS
MUCH
AS
WITH
THE
FEDERAL
ASSISTANCE
MUCH
OF
THE
QUESTION
THAT
WE
HAD
DESIGNED
YOU
HAVE
ANSWERED
IN
YOUR
OPENING
COMMENTS
SO
WE
MUST
BE
THINKING
ALIKE
BUT
THE
QUESTION
ESSENTIALLY
INVOLVED
WHAT
INITIATIVES
AFTER
LABOR
DAY
WOULD
BE
APPROPRIATE
WE
KNOW
SUMMERTIME
IS
IMPORTANT
YEARROUND
IS
EVEN
MORE
IMPORTANT
AND
WHAT
KIND
OF
INITIATIVES
AT
THE
FEDERAL
LEVEL
MIGHT
BE
PROPOSED
TO
MEET
THE
NEEDS
OF
THE
YOUTH
ON
A
YEAR
ROUND
BASIS
AND
PERHAPS
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
HOW
CAN
FAMILIES
AND
THE
LOCAL
COMMUNITY
BE
MORE
INVOLVED
USING
THE
FEDERAL
INITIATIVE
THATS
SOMETHING
THAT
WE
BELIEVE
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
TO
SUCCESS
IN
THIS
EFFORT
SECRETARY
RILEY
MR
PRESIDENT
THE
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
ILL
GIVE
EVERYBODY
A
CHANCE
TO
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
BRUCE
BUT
LET
ME
FIRST
THANK
YOU
FOR
CALLING
AND
THANK
YOU
FOR
ALL
THE
GREAT
WORK
THAT
YOURE
DOING
IN
AUSTIN
IVE
SEEN
SOME
OF
IT
AND
IVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
VERY
IMPRESSED
FIRST
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
SUMMER
PROGRAM
WE
HOPE
WE
CAN
STRUCTURE
IT
IN
A
WAY
THAT
WILL
ENABLE
US
TO
CONTINUE
THE
SUMMER
PROGRAM
AND
THAT
WILL
MOVE
A
LOT
OF
THESE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
BACK
INTO
SCHOOLS
UNDER
CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT
MIGHT
ALLOW
THEM
TO
DO
SOME
WORK
IN
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
TOO
WE
HOPE
THAT
SECRETARY
REICH
IS
GOING
TO
TRY
TO
SET
UP
A
SYSTEM
WHERE
WE
CREATE
A
LOT
OF
PRIVATE
SECTOR
JOBS
TO
BE
MATCHED
WITH
THE
PUBLIC
SECTOR
JOBS
THIS
SUMMER
AND
WERE
WORKING
ON
THAT
SECONDLY
IN
THE
PROGRAM
THAT
I
HAVE
PRESENTED
TO
THE
CONGRESS
OVER
THE
NEXT
FIVE
YEARS
WHAT
WE
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
DO
IS
TO
BUILD
IN
AN
AMOUNT
OF
INVESTMENT
THATS
QUITE
SUBSTANTIAL
FOR
JOB
TRAINING
PROGRAMS
FOR
SCHOOLTOWORK
PROGRAMS
ALL
OF
WHICH
GIVE
HEAVY
HEAVY
WEIGHT
TO
LOCAL
COMMUNITY
INPUT
JUST
THE
QUESTION
YOU
ASKED
BUT
DO
PROVIDE
SOME
FEDERAL
INVESTMENT
DOLLARS
WHICH
WE
HOPE
YOU
CAN
PUT
WITH
LOCAL
DOLLARS
TO
KEEP
PEOPLE
WORKING
AND
BEING
TRAINED
ON
A
YEARROUND
BASIS
AND
I
WILL
SAY
AGAIN
TO
ECHO
WHAT
SECRETARY
REICH
SAID
A
MOMENT
AGO
TO
TRY
TO
BREAK
DOWN
THE
BARRIER
BETWEEN
WHAT
IS
SEEN
AS
WORK
AND
WHAT
IS
SEEN
AS
LEARNING
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
YOUNG
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
HAVE
QUITE
HIGH
IQS
BUT
ACTUALLY
LEARN
SO
MUCH
BETTER
WHEN
THEYRE
DOING
THAN
WHEN
THEYRE
READING
OR
JUST
LISTENING
SO
WE
HOPE
THAT
THE
COMMUNITY
INVOLVEMENT
PART
OF
IT
WILL
BE
PERMANENT
AND
WE
HOPE
THAT
IF
THE
WHOLE
BUDGET
PASSES
AND
WE
DO
HAVE
BUDGET
CUTS
AND
MORE
THAN
ACTUALLY
IN
THE
BUDGET
AND
SOME
REVENUE
RAISERS
AND
SOME
NEW
MONEY
FOR
EDUCATION
AND
TRAINING
THAT
WELL
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
JUST
WHAT
YOU
SEEM
TO
WANT
BASED
ON
YOUR
QUESTION
BOB
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
SECRETARY
REICH
WELL
YOU
TOOK
MOST
OF
THE
WORDS
OUT
OF
MY
MOUTH
MR
PRESIDENT
AS
USUAL
BUT
LET
ME
JUST
ADD
ONE
THING
AND
THAT
IS
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
ASPECTS
OF
POSTHIGH
SCHOOL
FOR
A
LOT
OF
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
NOT
GOING
ON
TO
COLLEGE
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
SCHOOLTOWORK
PROGRAM
SIMPLY
IS
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
JOBS
AND
WEVE
GOT
TO
GET
THIS
ECONOMY
MOVING
AGAIN
OBVIOUSLY
ITS
TERRIBLY
IMPORTANT
TO
GET
THIS
RECOVERY
PROGRAM
TO
GET
THE
ECONOMY
BACK
ON
TRACK
THATS
SORT
OF
THE
PREREQUISITE
TO
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IF
WE
DONT
GET
THE
ECONOMY
BACK
ON
TRACK
WE
HAVE
I
THINK
THIS
IS
THE
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
MR
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
IS
THE
MONTH
WE
HAVE
HAD
SEVEN
PERCENT
UNEMPLOYMENT
OR
GREATER
THIS
IS
A
JOBLESS
RECOVERY
A
LOT
OF
THOSE
KIDS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
GETTING
OUT
OF
SCHOOL
IN
JUNE
AND
EVEN
IF
WE
DID
EVERYTHING
RIGHT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
A
VERY
VERY
HARD
TIME
GETTING
JOBS
SECRETARY
RILEY
THANK
YOU
BOTH
OF
COURSE
GOALS
WILL
BE
A
PERMANENT
LONGTERM
THING
THAT
WILL
CERTAINLY
REACH
INTO
NEXT
YEAR
IT
WILL
INVOLVE
IF
PASSED
AND
WE
CERTAINLY
HOPE
IT
WILL
BE
ACTION
PLANS
WITH
EVERY
STATE
WHERE
WE
CAN
BE
WORKING
TOGETHER
TO
REACH
FOR
THE
GOALS
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
WAYS
AND
THEN
THE
STATE
WITH
ALL
THE
VARIOUS
SCHOOL
DISTRICTS
A
VERY
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THAT
WILL
BE
CITIZEN
AND
PARENT
INVOLVEMENT
AND
I
THINK
EVERYBODY
WILL
SEE
A
GREAT
ENERGY
OUT
THERE
ONCE
WE
GET
THAT
MOVING
THE
NEXT
CALL
IS
DR
HARRY
HEINEMANN
NEW
YORK
DOCTOR
Q
GOOD
EVENING
MR
SECRETARY
IT
IS
A
PLEASURE
TO
BE
ON
WITH
YOU
THIS
EVENING
AS
YOU
MAY
KNOW
BRIDGING
THE
SCHOOL
AND
WORK
HAS
BEEN
CENTRAL
TO
LA
GUARDIAS
EDUCATIONAL
PROGRAM
SINCE
ITS
INCEPTION
IN
THE
AND
THAT
INCLUDES
THE
COLLEGE
THE
TWO
ALTERNATIVE
HIGH
SCHOOLS
THAT
OPERATE
ON
OUR
CAMPUS
AND
THE
LINKAGES
WE
HAVE
FORGED
WITH
THE
LOCAL
SCHOOLS
WE
HAVE
FOUND
THIS
TO
BE
AN
EXTREMELY
EFFECTIVE
LEARNING
STRATEGY
AND
OVER
THE
YEARS
WEVE
COME
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
PRINCIPLES
THAT
ARE
VERY
IMPORTANT
IN
BRIDGING
THE
SCHOOL
AND
WORK
AND
THESE
INCLUDE
INTEGRATING
THEORY
IN
THE
CLASSROOM
WITH
PRACTICE
IN
THE
WORKPLACE
WITH
PROVIDING
ALL
STUDENTS
EARLY
EXPOSURE
TO
CAREERS
AS
WELL
AS
PROVIDING
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
THEM
TO
REFLECT
UPON
THESE
EXPERIENCES
WHILE
THEY
STRENGTHEN
THEIR
SKILLS
AND
LASTLY
THE
CRITICAL
ROLE
OF
THE
LIBERAL
ARTS
PARTICULARLY
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
COMPETENCIES
MY
QUESTION
THEN
IS
HOW
CAN
THE
GENERAL
EDUCATION
FACULTY
AND
THE
ACADEMIC
CURRICULUM
BE
MORE
CLOSELY
INTEGRATED
WITH
TRANSITION
TO
WORK
EXPERIENCE
AND
WHAT
MECHANISMS
AND
STRATEGIES
CAN
YOU
SUGGEST
TO
ACHIEVE
THIS
INTEGRATION
SECRETARY
RILEY
WELL
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
I
THINK
AND
WELL
GET
A
RESPONSE
FROM
YOU
ALL
ON
THAT
AND
VERY
INTERESTING
WORK
GOING
ON
THERE
WERE
GOING
TO
HAVE
THREE
PEOPLE
OUR
NEXT
GUESTS
ON
THE
PROGRAM
THIS
EVENING
THAT
WILL
BE
SOME
SPECIALISTS
IN
THAT
AREA
THAT
YOURE
SPEAKING
AND
ILL
CERTAINLY
PASS
THAT
ON
TO
THEM
AND
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
IT
LATER
YOU
ALL
CARE
TO
COMMENT
ANY
COMMENTS
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
THE
PRESIDENT
ID
JUST
LIKE
TO
SAY
IF
I
MIGHT
ONE
THING
I
WANT
TO
REEMPHASIZE
THIS
AND
I
DONT
THINK
IM
BEING
AS
CLEAR
ABOUT
IT
AS
ID
LIKE
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WILL
BE
ON
THE
SECOND
PANEL
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
SAY
IT
MORE
EXPLICITLY
THAN
I
I
THINK
THIS
WHOLE
CONCEPT
OF
APPLIED
ACADEMICS
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
AND
I
THINK
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
BASICALLY
ABOLISH
WHAT
I
CONSIDER
TO
BE
A
VERY
ARTIFICIAL
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
WHAT
IS
VOCATIONAL
LEARNING
AND
WHAT
IS
ACADEMIC
LEARNING
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
KEEP
THE
LIBERAL
ARTS
GOING
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
A
STRONG
COMPONENT
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
IN
THE
VOCATIONAL
PROGRAM
SECRETARY
REICH
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WE
ALSO
NEED
TO
RETHINK
OUR
ENTIRE
TRACKING
SYSTEM
BECAUSE
A
LOT
OF
THESE
SCHOOL
AND
WORK
COMBINATIONS
ARE
IMPORTANT
FOR
MAINSTREAM
STUDENTS
THEYRE
IMPORTANT
FOR
ALL
STUDENTS
ITS
NOT
JUST
A
SPECIAL
GROUP
OF
STUDENTS
THAT
NEEDS
THEM
SOME
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTS
THAT
IVE
SEEN
AROUND
THE
UNITED
STATES
DICK
IM
SURE
YOUVE
SEEN
THEM
AS
WELL
ARE
MAINSTREAM
EXPERIMENTS
THEYRE
MAINSTREAMING
ALL
THE
STUDENTS
AT
AND
GRADES
THEYRE
GIVING
THEM
A
COMBINED
WORK
AND
SCHOOL
EXPERIENCE
AND
THEN
A
TRANSITION
PROGRAM
AND
AGAIN
THE
KIDS
CAN
EITHER
GO
ON
TO
COLLEGE
IF
THEY
WANT
THEY
CAN
GO
ON
TO
TECHNICAL
COMMUNITY
THEY
CAN
GO
ON
TO
AN
ENTIRELY
A
LARGE
VARIETY
OF
POSSIBILITIES
AND
CAREER
DIRECTIONS
BUT
WE
HAVE
TO
GET
AWAY
FROM
THE
STIGMATIZING
THAT
OFTEN
GOES
ON
WITH
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHO
SIMPLY
ARE
DOING
JOBRELATED
OR
WORK
RELATED
WORK
WITHIN
THE
CLASSROOM
WITHIN
OUR
SCHOOLS
SECRETARY
RILEY
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
I
THINK
THATS
GOING
TO
BE
THE
LAST
CALL
THAT
WE
HAVE
TIME
FOR
MR
PRESIDENT
I
THINK
YOUVE
GOT
TO
MOVE
ON
TO
ANOTHER
MATTER
AND
I
WANT
TO
THANK
YOU
AND
SECRETARY
REICH
FOR
BEING
HERE
WE
APPRECIATE
YOUR
TIME
AND
YOUR
IDEAS
AND
ITS
BEEN
A
TREMENDOUS
HELP
TO
US
PM
EDT
