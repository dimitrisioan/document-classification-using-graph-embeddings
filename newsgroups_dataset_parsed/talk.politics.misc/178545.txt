writes
in
the
world
of
the
future
bill
clinton
will
appoint
canadians
to
govern
all
american
institutions
starting
with
the
american
health
care
system
we
will
be
benevolent
canadian
dictators
with
yet
another
tax
being
floated
by
the
clinton
administration
to
pay
for
new
free
social
programs
ive
really
begun
to
suspect
that
the
canadians
long
resentful
of
their
place
in
the
american
shadow
brainwashed
an
american
draft
dodger
who
fled
to
canada
some
time
between
and
tutored
him
in
the
ways
of
canadian
socialism
awarded
him
with
smokeless
marijuana
cigarettes
when
he
got
the
correct
answers
then
returned
him
to
the
states
under
the
control
of
the
domineering
wife
assigned
to
his
case
to
attain
high
public
office
and
destroy
the
evil
individualistic
and
free
market
forces
in
america
thus
shaping
america
in
the
canadian
image
