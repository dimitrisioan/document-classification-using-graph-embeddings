RE
RACE
AND
VIOLENCE
JOE
AS
USUAL
THIS
ISSUE
OF
DYSFUNCTION
OF
BAD
VALUES
OF
MESSED
UP
CULTURE
IS
EASILY
EMBRACED
BY
NON
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
EXPLAINING
PROBLEMS
IN
OUR
COMMUNITY
FROM
YOUR
POST
YOU
APPARENTLY
FIND
THE
IDEA
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
WITH
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
VALUEWISE
CULTURE
WISE
OR
SOMETHING
VERY
APPEALING
I
NEVER
CEASE
TO
BE
AMAZED
AT
HOW
EAGER
NON
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
ARE
TO
EMBRACE
THEORIES
ABOUT
OUR
PROBLEMS
WHICH
BASICALLY
ASSERT
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
WITH
US
THE
SOCIOECONOMIC
FACTORS
WHICH
WE
KNOW
HELP
TO
PRODUCE
HIGH
CRIME
LEVELS
LIKE
POVERTY
WHICH
EXISTS
AMONG
US
IN
LARGE
PROPORTION
I
MEAN
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
DISCUSSION
OF
AFRICAN
AMERICAN
PROBLEMS
WE
SOMEHOW
BECOME
EXEMPT
FROM
ALL
THESE
TYPES
OF
FACTORS
AND
THE
PROBLEM
IS
LAID
AT
THE
DOORSTEP
OF
SOME
NEBOULOUS
DYSFUNCTION
WE
SUPPOSEDLY
HAVE
BUT
NOBODY
ATTRIBUTES
CRIME
AMONGST
WHITE
AMERICANS
TO
DYSFUNCTION
NO
THAT
HAS
SOCIOECONOMIC
FACTORS
TO
IT
BUT
FOR
AFRICA
AMERICANS
ITS
GOTTA
BE
A
DYSFUNCTION
BASICALLY
I
THINK
THIS
TENDENCY
FOR
NON
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
WITH
US
EXISTS
BECAUSE
NON
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
DONT
WANT
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
POSSIBLILITY
THAT
THE
SOCIETY
IS
DEEPLY
BIASED
AGAINST
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
AND
THAT
THIS
IS
ABOUT
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IT
COULD
NOT
POSSIBLE
BE
THAT
THE
SOCIETY
IS
SO
DEEPLY
RACIST
AND
STRUCTURED
AGAINST
US
THAT
THIS
HAS
A
VERY
EFFECTIVE
NEGATIVE
EFFECT
ON
US
NO
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
WITH
US
NON
AFRICAN
AMERICANS
ARE
QUICK
TO
DISREGARD
WHAT
WE
HAVE
TO
SAY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
SO
BUSY
TRYING
TO
FIND
SOMETHING
WRONG
WITH
US
INSTEAD
OF
TAKING
A
GOOD
HARD
LOOK
AT
THE
THING
WE
SAY
ARE
DOING
US
DAMAGE
I
WOULD
GET
ANGRY
IF
IT
WERENT
SO
DAMN
TYPICAL
PEACE
