why
dont
the
republicans
get
their
act
together
and
say
they
will
support
a
broadbased
vat
that
would
have
to
be
visible
the
vat
in
canada
is
visible
unlike
the
invisible
vats
they
have
in
europe
and
suggest
a
rate
sufficient
to
halve
income
and
corporate
and
capital
gains
tax
rates
and
at
a
rate
sufficient
to
give
the
clintons
enough
revenue
for
their
health
care
reform
the
republicans
are
in
general
fighting
any
tax
increase
there
is
also
worry
that
a
vat
would
be
far
too
easy
to
increase
incrementally
i
was
a
graduate
student
in
the
early
and
we
had
a
conference
on
reaganomics
where
jerry
jordan
then
a
member
of
the
council
of
economic
advisors
was
a
speaker
i
had
the
pleasure
of
driving
him
back
to
the
airport
afterwards
and
since
taxes
were
the
main
topic
of
discussion
i
thought
i
would
ask
him
about
the
vat
i
have
favored
it
for
these
reasons
you
mention
that
the
income
base
is
too
hazy
to
define
that
it
taxes
savings
and
investment
that
it
is
likely
to
be
more
visible
he
agreed
and
reported
that
the
cea
at
that
time
was
in
favor
of
vat
so
why
not
propose
it
i
asked
he
replied
that
the
reagan
white
house
feared
that
the
democrats
would
introduce
vat
in
addition
to
the
income
tax
rather
than
in
lieu
better
not
to
give
them
any
ideas
he
said
pretty
prescient
btw
what
is
different
between
canadas
tax
and
most
of
europes
that
makes
it
visible
yes
any
canadian
readers
please
tell
us
if
the
tax
is
displayed
on
price
stickers
im
relatively
certain
it
is
not
in
europe
