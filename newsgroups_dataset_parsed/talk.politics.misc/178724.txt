MATT
FREIVALD
SAID
I
LIKE
TO
CALL
THE
FORM
OF
GOVERNMENT
THAT
I
ADVOCATE
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
WITH
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
THERE
IS
A
REPRESENTATIVE
NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT
THAT
HAS
ONLY
CERTAIN
LIMITED
POWERS
TO
DO
WHAT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
AT
THAT
LEVEL
NEXT
THERE
ARE
THE
STATE
GOVERNMENTS
AGAIN
WITH
ONLY
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
POWERS
ONWARD
TO
COUNTIES
CITIESTOWNSHIPS
DISTRICTS
AND
NEIGHBORHOODS
THE
LOWEST
READ
MOST
LOCAL
LEVELS
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
HAVE
THE
MOST
POWER
OVER
INDIVIDUALS
DAYTODAY
LIVES
WHICH
IS
GOOD
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
LEVEL
WHERE
INDIVIDUALS
HAVE
THE
MOST
VOICE
YOU
KNOW
IF
YOU
TAKE
ALL
THIS
TO
ITS
LOGICAL
CONCLUSION
DOESNT
IT
SEEM
THAT
THE
REAL
LOWEST
LEVEL
THE
LEVEL
WHERE
INDIVIDUALS
HAVE
THE
MOST
VOICE
IS
THAT
OF
THE
SINGLE
INDIVIDUALS
THEMSELVES
WHY
HAVE
YOU
OMITTED
THAT
LEVEL
FROM
YOUR
MODEL
YES
AND
THE
INDIVIDUAL
IS
NOT
OMITTED
I
JUST
DIDNT
FULLY
ARTICULATE
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
ALL
GOVERNMENT
POWERS
DERIVE
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
EACH
LEVEL
CAN
RECEIVE
A
NEW
POWER
FROM
THE
LEVEL
BELOW
THROUGH
THE
AMENDMENT
PROCESS
WHERE
A
TRUE
CONSENSUS
SAY
A
MAJORITY
WRITES
THAT
POWER
INTO
THE
CONSTITUTION
OF
THE
LEVEL
ABOVE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
LOWEST
LEVEL
AN
AMENDEMENT
IS
PASSED
BY
A
MAJORITY
VOTE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
HIGHER
LEVELS
IT
MUST
BE
PASSED
BY
OF
THE
LEGISLATURES
WE
CAN
OF
COURSE
HAGGLE
ABOUT
THE
SPECIFICS
OF
TRUE
CONSENSUS
WHEN
WE
HOLD
OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL
CONVENTION
ONCE
A
POWER
HAS
BEEN
GRANTED
IT
MAY
BE
EXERCISED
BY
THE
LEGISLATURE
POWERS
NOT
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
CONSTITUTIONS
MUST
PERCOLATE
UPWARD
STARTING
FROM
THE
INDIVIDUAL
THE
RATIFICATION
PROCESS
FOR
THE
ORIGINAL
CONSTITUTIONS
SHOULD
INVOLVE
CONSENSUS
AND
NOT
SIMPLY
A
PLURALITY
OR
MAJORITY
GRANTING
A
RIGHT
IN
A
CONSTITUTION
IS
OF
COURSE
THE
SAME
AS
EMPOWERING
THE
GOVERNMENT
AT
THAT
LEVEL
TO
RESTRICT
THE
ACTIVITIES
OF
THE
GOVERNMENTS
AT
THE
LOWER
LEVELS
SO
IT
OPERATES
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
AS
THE
AMENDMENT
PROCESS
AGAIN
THAT
CRAZY
RESEMBLANCE
TO
THE
SUPPOSEDBUTNOTACTUAL
US
GOVERNMENT
STRUCTURE
THIS
GOVERNMENT
STRUCTURE
IS
A
VERY
FRUSTRATING
ONE
FOR
THOSE
PEOPLE
READ
LIBERALS
WHO
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HAVE
CONCENTRATED
POWER
TO
USE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
FORCE
PEOPLE
TO
DO
GOOD
A
DIFFICULTTODEFINE
WORD
AND
ONE
THAT
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
REACH
A
CONSENSUS
ON
IT
IS
ALSO
A
FRUSTRATING
STRUCTURE
FOR
THOSE
WHO
WANT
TO
USE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
DICTATE
PERSONAL
BEHAVIOR
READ
BIGGOVERNMENT
CONSERVATIVES
I
PERSONALLY
WOULD
RATHER
SEE
THOSE
TYPES
OF
PEOPLE
FRUSTRATED
THAN
THE
INCREDIBLE
EROSION
OF
LIBERTY
BOTH
CIVIL
AND
ECONOMIC
THAT
IS
GOING
ON
NOW
THIS
IS
IMHO
A
GOOD
GOVERNMENT
STUCTURE
FOR
THOSE
WHO
SEE
THE
ROLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
AS
THE
PROTECTION
OF
INDIVIDUAL
LIBERTIES
WHILE
STILL
RECOGNIZING
THAT
INDIVIDUALS
NEED
TO
HAVE
SOME
INFLUENCE
IN
THE
TYPE
OF
COMMUNITY
THAT
THEY
LIVE
IN
A
FREE
MARKET
WORKS
ON
GOVERNMENT
NOT
JUST
ECONOMICS
SUCCESFUL
IDEAS
PROPOGATE
UNSUCCESSFUL
IDEAS
DIE
WHAT
IS
YOUR
DEFINITION
OF
A
SUCCESSFUL
IDEA
OR
A
SUCCESSFUL
GOVERNMENT
ONE
WHICH
MAINTAINS
PEACE
LIBERTY
AND
THE
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
HAPPINESS
FOR
ITS
PEOPLE
WHILE
WORKING
WITHIN
THE
REALITIES
OF
HUMAN
NATURE
YOU
DO
BRING
UP
THE
POINT
INTENTIONAL
OR
NOT
THAT
A
LASTING
IDEA
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
NECESSARILY
A
SUCCESSFUL
IDEA
I
BELIEVE
THAT
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
WOULD
AT
LEAST
BRING
MANY
IDEAS
TO
LIGHT
AND
THE
PEOPLE
WOULD
HAVE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
DEMOCRATICALLY
CHOOSE
BETWEEN
GOOD
IDEAS
AND
BAD
IDEAS
IF
THE
DOCIALISTS
ER
I
MEAN
DEMOCRATS
ARE
RIGHT
AND
GOVERNMENT
ACTIVISM
FOSTERS
A
PROSPEROUS
PEOPLE
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
PLETHORA
OF
LOCAL
OPPORTUNITIES
TO
CHECK
THEIR
THESIS
IF
LIBERTOPIA
IS
POSSIBLE
IT
WILL
ARISE
IF
A
BALANCED
CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLIC
IS
DEMOCRATICALLY
RECEIVED
AS
THE
BEST
LEVEL
OF
GOVERNMENT
ACTIVITY
IT
WILL
BECOME
CLEAR
TO
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
IT
IS
BEST
AS
FAR
AS
SET
THE
MORAL
TONE
IS
CONCERNED
IF
A
COMMUNITY
DOES
NOT
COLLECTIVELY
WANT
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
PROSTITUTION
GOING
ON
IN
FRONT
OF
THEIR
KIDS
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
HAVE
TO
IF
A
COMMUNITY
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
SEE
PROLIFERATION
OF
DRUGS
AMONG
THEIR
KIDS
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
HAVE
TO
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
A
CHURCH
OPERATING
RIGHT
OUT
IN
THE
OPEN
WHERE
THEIR
KIDS
CAN
SEE
IT
AND
WITH
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
HOUSE
ACROSS
THE
STREET
FLYING
AN
AMERICAN
FLAG
RIGHT
OUT
THERE
IN
THE
OPEN
EVERY
DAY
IN
FRONT
OF
THEIR
KIDS
ITS
CALLED
FREEDOM
IF
THEY
DONT
LIKE
THE
IDEAS
TO
WHICH
THEIR
KIDS
ARE
EXPOSED
THEY
CAN
TRY
TO
EDUCATE
AND
PERSUADE
THEIR
KIDS
AS
TO
WHY
THE
THINGS
THAT
THEYRE
SEEING
OTHER
PEOPLE
DOING
ARE
WRONG
OR
BAD
RIGHT
AND
PEOPLE
WOULD
NOT
RESCIND
ANY
FREEDOMS
READ
EMPOWER
THE
GOVERNMENT
EXCEPT
THROUGH
THE
AMENDMENT
PROCESS
THAT
IS
HOW
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
WORK
NOW
BUT
THE
SUPREME
SOVIET
ER
I
MEAN
THE
SUPREME
COURT
PUT
A
STOP
TO
THAT
REPUBLICAN
GOVERNMENT
NONSENSE
IN
MY
HYPOTHETICAL
GOVERNMENT
IF
THERE
WERE
A
CONSTITUTIONAL
PROVISION
EMPOWERING
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
REGULATE
CHURCHES
THE
GOVERNMENT
WHATEVER
LEVEL
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
COULD
INDEED
BAN
CHURCHES
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
PROVISION
WOULD
BE
INVALID
IF
A
HIGHER
LEVEL
HAD
A
CONSTITUTIONAL
PROVISION
PROTECTING
FREE
EXERCISE
OF
RELIGION
THE
UPPERMOST
CONSTITUTION
IS
STILL
THE
SUPREME
LAW
OF
THE
LAND
I
FIND
IT
INTERESTING
THAT
YOU
APPLAUD
THE
IDEA
OF
FREEMARKET
COMPETITION
AMONG
VARIOUS
IDEAS
AND
YET
SUPPORT
THE
RIGHT
OF
HE
MAJORITY
IN
A
COMMUNITY
TO
SUPPRESS
IDEAS
WHICH
THEY
DONT
LIKE
IT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
INDIVIDUALS
BEING
ABLE
TO
CONTROL
THEIR
OWN
ASSOCIATIONS
AND
ENVIRONMENT
NOT
A
MATTER
OF
SUPPRESSION
OF
IDEAS
ONE
DILEMMA
OF
THE
HUMAN
CONDITION
IS
THAT
INDIVIDUALS
NEED
LIBERTY
AND
THEY
ALSO
NEED
TO
HAVE
SOME
CONTROL
OVER
THEIR
ENVIRONMENT
IN
MY
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
GOVERNMENT
CERTAIN
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTIONS
OTHER
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
EMPOWERED
TO
INFRINGE
UPON
THEM
WHEN
A
CONSENSUS
IS
REACHED
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
HAVE
A
CERTAIN
POWER
THEN
FREEDOM
IS
INFRINGED
UPON
THIS
CANNOT
BE
AVOIDED
MURDER
STATUTES
INFRINGE
UPON
FREEDOM
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THE
CONSENSUS
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
IS
THAT
MURDER
STATUTES
ARE
A
GOOD
IDEA
I
AM
SURE
THAT
MANY
PARENTS
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
CONTROL
THE
ENVIRONMENT
THAT
THEIR
CHILDREN
LIVE
IN
PEOPLE
FEEL
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
SLEEP
PEACEFULLY
AT
NIGHT
THUS
THERE
ARE
NOISE
ORDINANCES
THERE
ARE
ZONING
LAWS
THAT
KEEP
BUSINESSES
FROM
OVERRUNNING
RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOODS
I
DO
NOT
VIEW
THESE
AS
BAD
THINGS
CERTAINLY
SOME
INDIVIDUAL
INSTANCES
ARE
BAD
BUT
THE
CONCEPT
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
BAD
I
VIEW
THEM
AS
THE
PEOPLE
IN
A
COMMUNITY
HAVING
SOME
CONTROL
OVER
THE
TYPE
OF
COMMUNITY
THAT
THEY
LIVE
IN
I
SEE
THE
ALTERNATIVE
AS
NEAR
ANARCHY
LIKE
I
SAID
IN
ANOTHER
POST
IF
YOU
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
A
SCENARIO
WHERE
AN
INDIVIDUAL
CAN
DO
SOMETHING
TRULY
AUTONOMOUSLY
WITH
ABSOLUTELY
ZERO
EFFECT
ON
ANYONE
ELSE
THEN
NO
INDIVIDUAL
OR
GOVERNMENT
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
RESTRICT
THAT
ACTIVITY
THERE
ARE
SIMPLY
NOT
VERY
MANY
BEHAVIORS
THAT
FIT
INTO
THE
CATEGORY
OF
THE
TRULY
AUTONOMOUS
SO
THE
WHOLE
THING
BECOMES
AN
ISSUE
OF
ONE
INDIVIDUAL
OR
GROUP
HAVING
POWER
OVER
ANOTHER
INDIVIDUAL
OR
GROUP
I
THINK
THAT
THE
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
APPROACH
IS
A
SOUND
IF
NOT
IDEAL
APPROACH
TO
LIMITING
THIS
RESTRICTIVE
POWER
THE
LIBERTARIAN
SCENARIO
DEGENERATES
TO
MIGHT
MAKES
RIGHT
AND
THE
SYSTEM
WE
HAVE
RIGHT
NOW
IS
ONE
OF
LAWYERS
ABUSING
NATURAL
RIGHTS
PHILOSOPHY
TO
DECIDE
WHAT
POWERS
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
HAVE
BY
SUBVERTING
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
THOUGH
THE
SUPREME
COURT
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
EGALITARIAN
VIEW
IS
THAT
IT
TRIES
TO
DENY
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
DILEMMA
OF
DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
EXERCISE
A
VOICE
IN
THEIR
COMMUNITY
YET
INDIVIDUALS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
BE
LEFT
TO
THEMSELVES
THIS
IS
A
SERIOUS
DILEMMA
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NOT
MUCH
THAT
TAKES
PLACE
IN
A
VACUUM
ODDLY
ENOUGH
IF
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
TAKEN
LITERALLY
THERE
IS
LITTLE
OR
NO
CONFLICT
THE
PEOPLE
DO
INDEED
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
EXERCISE
A
VOICE
WHERE
VOICE
EQUALS
PERSUASIVE
SPEECH
IN
THEIR
COMMUNITIES
ITS
ONLY
WHEN
THEY
SOMEHOW
GET
THE
IDEA
INTO
THEIR
HEADS
THAT
THEY
ALSO
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
DICTATE
BEHAVIOR
IN
THEIR
COMMUNITIES
THAT
THE
TROUBLE
BEGINS
I
THINK
I
ANSWERED
THIS
ABOVE
ALREADY
BUT
LET
ME
EXPAND
A
LITTLE
MORE
WITH
AN
EXAMPLE
IF
I
STAND
NAKED
IN
FRONT
OF
YOUR
HOUSE
AND
MASTURBATE
IN
FRONT
OF
YOUR
CHILDREN
WHILE
THEY
PLAY
IN
YOUR
LIBERTARIAN
SMALL
L
SCENARIO
THE
ONLY
RECOURSE
YOU
HAVE
IS
TO
YELL
AT
ME
AUTONOMOUS
IS
A
VALUE
JUDGEMENT
OF
THE
TIME
IT
IS
NOT
A
SCIENTIFIC
REALITY
WITH
A
CLEAR
DEFINITION
EXACTLY
WHO
WOULD
YOU
EMPOWER
TO
MAKE
THAT
VALUE
JUDGEMENT
STUFF
DELETED
CERTAINLY
NOT
THE
ONLY
CAUSE
MIKE
BUT
PEOPLE
IN
A
LOCAL
NEIGHBORHOOD
SHOULD
HAVE
A
VOICE
IN
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD
TO
DENY
THIS
IS
TO
CREATE
ANOTHER
CONCENTRATED
CENTRALIZED
POWER
TO
KEEP
THE
LOCALITY
FROM
ABUSING
ITS
POWER
IN
ESSENCE
USING
A
PIT
BULL
TO
KEEP
A
TOY
POODLE
FROM
BITING
YOUR
LEG
CHANCES
ARE
THE
PIT
BULL
IS
GOING
TO
TURN
ON
YOU
SOME
DAY
AND
YOU
HAVE
MUCH
LESS
DEFENSE
AGAINST
IT
THAN
YOU
DO
AGAINST
THE
TOY
POODLE
THE
ARGUMENT
HERE
APPEARS
TO
BE
THAT
TYRANNY
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
BY
THE
LOCAL
MAJORITY
IS
SUPERIOR
TO
HAVING
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
HAVE
AND
EXERCISE
THE
POWER
TO
PROTECT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
FROM
HIS
NEIGHBORS
BECAUSE
THAT
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
WILL
EVENTUALLY
AND
INEVITABLY
BECOME
CORRUPT
AND
USE
ITS
POWER
TO
TYRANNIZE
EVERYONE
OKAY
THERES
A
LOT
OF
TRUTH
IN
THAT
CERTAINLY
WERE
SEEING
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
HAPPENING
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
TODAY
THOUGH
ITS
UNCLEAR
THAT
HE
PROGRESSION
HERE
MATCHES
THE
MODEL
SINCE
OUR
BELOVED
AND
BENIGN
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
HASNT
EVERSHOWN
MUCH
ENTHUSIASM
FOR
THE
IDEA
OF
PROTECTING
ANY
INDIVIDUALS
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
ARE
LONG
ON
COMPLAINTS
AND
SHORT
ON
PRACTICAL
SOLUTIONS
ALTHOUGH
I
AM
PESSIMISTIC
THAT
MY
IDEA
WILL
EVER
BEAR
FRUIT
I
AM
AT
LEAST
TRYING
TO
BE
LONG
ON
SOLUTIONS
ALSO
I
AM
TRULY
INTERESTED
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
IMPROVEMENTS
TO
MAKE
ON
MY
IDEAS
I
CALL
THEM
MY
IDEAS
BUT
THEY
ALL
COME
FROM
AN
AVERAGE
GUY
READING
OF
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
WITHOUT
BENEFIT
OF
THE
INDOCTRINATION
OF
CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW
ACADEMIA
BUT
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
THINK
THAT
YOUR
SOLUTION
IS
AT
LEAST
JUST
AS
BAD
TRADING
THE
YOKE
OF
FEDERAL
TYRANNY
FOR
THE
YOKE
OF
LOCAL
TYRANNY
DOESNT
CHEER
ME
UP
MUCH
I
THINK
ID
PREFER
TO
PUT
MY
FAITH
IN
A
LARGER
GOVERNMENT
THAT
AT
LEAST
MIGHT
PROTECT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
RATHER
THAN
PLACE
IT
IN
LOCAL
MOB
RULE
ADMITTEDLY
ITS
THE
LESSER
OF
TWO
EVILS
AND
ITS
NOT
LESS
BY
VERY
MUCH
AND
THEYRE
BOTH
PRETTY
DAMN
EVIL
SORRY
THE
CONFUSION
WAS
MY
FAULT
WHEN
I
SAID
THAT
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
RESEMBLES
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
I
MEANT
IT
AND
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
PRETTY
CLEAR
I
SHOULD
HAVE
MORE
CLEARLY
EXPLAINED
THAT
THE
ULTIMATE
DERIVATION
OF
GOVERNMENT
POWER
IS
FROM
THE
CONSENSUS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ALTHOUGH
NOT
THE
CONSENT
OF
EVERY
INDIVIDUAL
A
PRACTICAL
OBSERVATION
NOT
A
MORAL
JUDGEMENT
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
BETTER
THAN
HAVING
ALL
GOVERNMENT
POWER
DERIVE
FROM
NINE
LAWYERS
WHICH
IS
THE
SITUATION
WE
HAVE
NOW
THAT
IS
WHY
I
THINK
THE
SUPREME
COURT
SHOULD
BE
A
JURY
COURT
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
JURY
FOR
EACH
CASE
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
PERFECT
NO
PHILOSOPHY
OF
GOVERNMENT
IS
BUT
DO
YOU
STILL
FIND
IT
A
REPUGNANT
IDEA
IF
SO
WHAT
IS
YOUR
SOLUTION
IDEALLY
EVERYONE
WOULD
LEAVE
EVERYONE
ELSE
ALONE
AND
NO
GOVERNMENT
COERCIVE
POWER
OF
ANY
KIND
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
THIS
WILL
NEVER
WORK
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
ARE
DIFFERENT
AND
BY
THEIR
NATURE
THEY
WILL
ALWAYS
WANT
TO
FORCE
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
OTHERS
IF
THIS
WERE
NOT
THE
CASE
NOBODY
WOULD
TRY
TO
FORCE
THEIR
VIEW
THAT
MURDER
IS
WRONG
ON
ANYONE
ELSE
THIS
IS
TRUE
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
WE
YOU
GOING
TO
DO
ABOUT
IT
YOUR
PROPOSED
SOLUTION
SEEMS
TO
ACTUALLY
ENCOURAGE
THESE
BOZOS
TO
LORD
IT
OVER
THEIR
VICTIMS
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
MISUNDERSTOOD
THE
STRUCTURE
OF
THE

ADVOCATE

IT
