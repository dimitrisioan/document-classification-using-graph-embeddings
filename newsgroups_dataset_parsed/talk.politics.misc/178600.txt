SOME
SCIENTISTS
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
GREEN
HOUSE
EFFECT
THE
FOLLOWING
STATEMENT
WAS
RELEASED
ON
FEBRUARY
BY
THE
SCIENCE
ENVIRONMENTAL
POLICY
PROJECT
AS
INDEPENDENT
SCIENTISTS
RESEARCHING
ATMOSPHERE
AND
CLIMATE
PROBLEMS
WE
ARE
CONCERNED
BY
THE
AGENDA
FOR
UNCED
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
CONFERENCE
ON
ENVIRONMENT
AND
DEVELOPMENT
BEING
DEVELOPED
BY
ENVIRONMENTAL
AND
ACTIVISTS
GROUPS
AND
CERTAIN
POLITICAL
LEADERS
THIS
SO
CALLED
EARTH
SUMMIT
IS
SCHEDULED
TO
CONVENE
IN
BRAZIL
IN
JUNE
AND
AIMS
TO
IMPOSE
A
SYSTEM
OF
GLOBAL
ENVIONMENTAL
REGULATIONS
INCLUDING
ONEROUS
TAXES
ON
ENERGY
FUELS
ON
THE
POPULATION
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
OTHER
INDUSTRIALIZED
NATIONS
SUCH
POLICY
INITIATIVES
DERIVE
FROM
HIGHLY
UNCETAIN
SCIENTIFIC
THEORIES
THEY
ARE
BASED
ON
THE
UNSUPPORTED
ASSUMPTION
THAT
CATASTROPHIC
GLOBAL
WARMING
FOLLOWS
FROM
THE
BURNING
OF
FOSSILL
FUELS
AND
REQUIRES
IMMEDIATE
ACTION
WE
DO
NOT
AGREE
A
SURVEY
OF
US
ATMOSPHERIC
SCIENTISTS
CONDUCTED
IN
THE
SUMMER
OF
CONFIRMS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
CONSESENSUS
ABOUT
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
SLIGHT
WARMING
OBSERVED
DURING
THE
PAST
CENTURY
A
RECENTLY
PUBLISHED
RESEARCH
PAPER
EVEN
SUGGESTS
SUNSPOT
VARIABILITY
WHICH
IS
DIRECTLY
PROPORTIONAL
TO
SOLAR
ACTIVITY
RATHER
THAN
A
RISE
IN
GREENHOUSE
GASES
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
GLOBAL
TEMPERATURE
INCREASES
AND
DECREASES
RECODED
SINCE
ABOUT
FUTHERMORE
THE
MAJORITY
OF
SCIENTIFIC
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THE
SURVEY
AGREED
THAT
THE
THEORETICAL
CLIMATE
CLIMATE
MODELS
USED
TO
PREDICT
A
FUTURE
WARMING
CANNOT
BE
RELIED
UPON
AND
ARE
NOT
VALIDATED
BY
THE
EXISTING
CLIMATE
RECORD
YET
ALL
PREDICTIONS
ARE
BASED
ON
SUCH
THEORETICAL
MODELS
FINALLY
AGRICULTURALITS
GENERALLY
AGREE
THAT
ANY
INCREASE
IN
CARBON
DIOXIDE
LEVELS
FROM
FOSSIL
FUELS
BURNING
HAS
BENEFICIAL
EFFECTS
ON
MOST
CROPS
AND
ON
WORLD
FOOD
SUPPLY
WE
ARE
DISTURBED
THAT
ACTIVISTS
ANXIOUS
TO
STOP
ENERGY
AND
ECONOMIC
GROWTH
ARE
PUSHING
AHEAD
WITH
DRASTIC
POLICIES
WITHOUT
TAKING
NOTICE
OF
RECENT
CHANGES
IN
THE
UNDERLYING
SCIENCE
WE
FEAR
THAT
THE
RUSH
TO
IMPOSE
GLOBAL
REGULATIONS
WILL
HAVE
CATASTROPHIC
IMPACTS
ON
THE
WORLD
ECONOMY
ON
JOBS
STANDARDS
OF
LIVING
AND
HEALTH
CARE
WITH
THE
MOST
SEVERE
CONSEQUENCES
FALLING
ON
DEVELOPING
