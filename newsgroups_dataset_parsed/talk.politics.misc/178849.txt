THE
SELECTIVE
SERVICE
REGISTRATION
SHOULD
BE
ABOLISHED
TO
START
WITH
THE
DRAFT
IS
IMMORAL
WHETHER
YOU
AGREE
WITH
THAT
OR
NOT
WE
DONT
HAVE
ONE
NOW
AND
MILITARY
EXPERTS
AGREE
THAT
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
ARMED
FORCES
IS
SUPERIOR
WITH
A
VOLUNTEER
ARMY
THAN
WITH
DRAFTEES
FINALLY
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
US
ON
MANY
LISTS
IN
MANY
COMPUTERS
THE
IRS
SOCIAL
SECURITY
ADMISTRATION
AND
MOTOR
VEHICLE
REGISTRIES
TO
NAME
A
FEW
AND
IT
CAN
FIND
US
IF
IT
NEEDS
TO
MAINTAINING
YET
ANOTHER
LIST
OF
PEOPLE
IS
AN
UTTER
WASTE
OF
MONEY
AND
TIME
LETS
AXE
THIS
WHOLE
DEPARTMENT
AND
REDUCE
THE
DEFICIT
A
LITTLE
BIT
IM
REALLY
SURPRISED
CLINTON
HASNT
ALREADY
TRIED
TO
DO
THIS
HE
SEEMS
TO
WANT
TO
TACKLE
OTHER
IRRELEVANT
ISSUES
FIRST
SO
WHY
NOT
THIS
ONE
AS
WELL
CONSIDERING
THAT
CLINTON
RECEIVED
A
DRAFT
NOTICE
AND
GOT
OUT
OF
IT
HE
ADMITS
IT
THE
POLITICAL
FEASIBILITY
OF
HIM
ABOLISHING
IT
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
HE
WOULD
BE
INCLINED
TO
RISK
ANY
EXTRA
EXPOSURE
ON
LET
ME
SAY
THIS
ABOUT
THAT
AS
A
RETIRED
NAVY
OFFICER
I
AGREE
CUT
IT
BUT
LETS
NOT
STOP
THERE
ELIMINATE
THE
TRANSPORT
WRONG
WE
NEED
ITS
CAPABILITY
SURE
IT
HAS
ITS
PROBLEMS
VERY
FEW
AIRPLANES
HAVENT
BUT
GETTING
RID
OF
SOMETHING
WE
NEED
IS
NOT
THE
ANSWER
WHAT
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
START
OVER
A
REBUILD
A
NEW
AIRPLANE
FROM
SCATCH
ITLL
HAVE
ITS
PROBLEMS
AS
WELL
AND
THERE
WILL
BE
CALLS
AGAIN
FOR
IT
TO
BE
SCRAPPED
THE
OTHER
OPTION
IS
TO
TRY
TO
EXTEND
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
AND
THAT
ARE
GETTING
EXTREMELY
OLD
IF
YOU
READ
AVIATION
WEEK
THE
LINE
CAN
BE
REOPENED
AND
THE
WOULD
BE
DELIVERED
A
YEAR
EARLIER
AND
COST
A
BILLION
LESS
FOR
THE
PROGRAM
POLITICALLY
THOUGH
THE
IS
POPULAR
PORK
SCRAP
THE
SEAWOLF
NUCLEAR
SUBMARINE
GROUND
THE
STEALTH
BOMBER
ITLL
COST
JOBS
BUT
IM
FOR
IT
WE
ESPECIALLY
DONT
NEED
A
THE
I
KNOW
LITTTLE
ABOUT
AGREED
CONGRESS
TOOK
MONEY
FROM
NASA
AND
FHA
TO
FUND
THE
SECOND
SEAWOLF
THE
SHIPYARDS
ARE
STILL
BUILDING
LOS
ANGELES
CLASS
SUBMARINES
AND
THERE
IS
A
LACK
OF
ASW
FOES
TO
CONTEND
WITH
THE
NAVY
IS
CONSIDERING
REDUCING
THE
NUMBER
OF
ATTACK
SUBS
TO
NAVY
TIMES
AND
THAT
WOULD
ENTAIL
GETTING
RID
OF
OR
MOTHBALLING
SOME
OF
THE
CURRENT
LOS
ANGELES
CLASS
POLITICALLY
GENERAL
DYNAMICS
IS
IN
CONNECTICUT
AND
WE
WILL
GET
SEAWOLF
SUBS
WHETHER
WE
NEED
THEM
OR
NOT
IN
ADDITION
MORE
BASES
NEED
TO
BE
CLOSED
PROBABLY
LONG
BEACH
NAVAL
STATION
AND
OTHERS
THE
NAVY
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
THREE
MAIN
BASES
ON
EACH
COAST
BEING
REQUIRED
TO
HOME
PORT
A
TOTAL
FLEET
OF
SHIPS
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
LES
ASPIN
AND
CLINTON
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
FACE
DOWN
A
PORK
HAPPY
CONGRESS
