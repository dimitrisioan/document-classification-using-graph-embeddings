COME
TO
LEARN
TO
SUSPECT
ANYTHING
IN
THE
AMERICAN
PRESS
ABOUT
OUR
SYSTEM
IF
MUCH
OR
SOME
OF
IT
WERE
TRUE
YOUD
HAVE
TO
TAKE
US
FOR
IDIOTS
FOR
TOLERATING
IT
AND
GIVEN
THAT
OUR
INSURANCE
WAS
INSTALLED
DURING
A
PERIOD
WHEN
THERE
WERE
ONLY
LIBERAL
AND
TORY
GOVERNMENTS
FEDERALLY
AND
PROVINCIALLY
AND
THE
SOCIALISTS
ARE
STILL
CHAFING
THEY
WOULDVE
PRESSED
FOR
REAL
SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE
TO
FIX
THINGS
THINK
ABOUT
IT
AFTER
ALL
WE
ARE
USING
THE
US
AS
A
METRIC
TO
MAKE
COMPARISON
BOTH
FOR
KEEPINGUPWITHTHEJONESES
AS
FOR
CONFIRMING
THAT
WE
DID
SOMETHING
RIGHT
TRUE
BUT
REMEMBER
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
CANADIANBASHING
EXISTS
BECAUSE
AMERICAN
PROPONENTS
OF
YOUR
SYSTEM
MAKE
IT
LOOK
LIKE
IT
WALKS
ON

EVEN
YOU
DONT
GO
THAT
FAR
SORRY
BUT
ID
HAVE
TO
DIFFER
THE
CANADIANBASHING
WRT
TO
THE
HEALTH
INSURANCE
SYSTEM
IS
LARGELY
WITH
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
OR
PROMPTING
HAVING
KEPT
UP
WITH
THIS
DEBATE
ON
THE
NET
FOR
SOME
MONTHS
JUST
ABOUT
ALL
THE
CRITICISM
OF
THE
CANADIAN
SYSTEM
HAS
MISQUOTED
OR
MISINTERPRETED
EVEN
THE
ANTICANADIAN
PROPAGANDA
PUT
OUT
BY
THE
AMERICAN
INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
AND
THE
AMA
IN
A
FEW
CASES
SUCH
AS
MR
CASE
THE
CRITIQUES
ARE
WELLREASONED
AND
WORTHY
OF
RESPONSE
MOST
OTHERS
ARE
MISINFORMED
ILLOGICAL
OR
JUST
PLAIN
DUMB
I
DONT
THINK
THE
SAME
CAN
BE
SAID
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PROPONENTS
OF
THE
CANADIAN
