you
dumb
shit
its
amazing
that
someone
with
your
limited
vocabulary
learned
how
to
use
a
computer
didnt
they
require
you
to
take
english
at
the
school
where
you
went
or
are
you
just
crude
by
nature
im
forced
to
agree
with
garrett
here
theres
no
need
for
vulgarity
or
even
hostility
i
mean
its
not
as
though
garrett
asked
to
be
born
dumber
than
a
bag
of
hammers
while
it
can
occasionally
be
annoying
there
is
a
noble
tragedy
to
someone
with
no
knowlege
of
geography
or
premadonna
history
thinking
that
his
political
views
are
worth
reading
something
like
a
hydroencephalic
trying
to
master
nuclear
physics
i
was
the
first
to
note
that
the
population
of
the
prc
isnt
gonna
fit
into
cambodia
unless
you
puree
them
so
theres
no
need
to
keep
pounding
on
that
idiocy
there
are
plenty
of
other
idiocies
in
his
post
find
your
own
and
stop
hogging
mine
at
first
this
kind
of
ranting
annoyed
me
but
now
its
rather
entertaining
these
kinds
of
posts
dont
require
any
facts
logic
or
even
sense
its
kind
of
like
what
old
kids
do
on
the
playground
so
go
on
and
play
not
everyone
on
the
net
is
as
simple
minded
as
you
guys
seem
to
be

was
what

were
after

damage
was
just
gravy
nothing
is
as
inevitable
as
a

whose

the

someone

is
proportional

stupidity
of
