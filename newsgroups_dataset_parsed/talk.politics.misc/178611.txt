critisism
is
too
easy
what
solutions
do
people
have
that
would
have
been
better
than
what
the
fbi
had
been
doing
for
the
last
few
months
firstly
they
could
have
backed
off
when
you
put
a
power
freak
like
david
koresh
in
that
kind
of
situation
he
is
going
to
explode
no
pun
intended
koresh
wanted
to
be
a
martyr
and
the
government
played
right
into
his
hands
if
the
government
hadnt
given
him
the
attention
he
wanted
nothing
would
have
ever
happened
secondly
the
davidians
were
expecting
everything
the
government
did
they
thought
that
they
were
facing
the
apocalypse
and
that
they
were
to
perish
in
fire
they
werent
scared
of
the
fbi
they
are
not
the
average
hoods
they
are
very
devout
followers
of
a
religion
psyops
didnt
work
and
the
government
got
frustrated
so
they
murdered
them
the
batf
should
have
left
at
the
beginning
they
should
have
looked
at
koreshs
personality
instead
they
thought
they
have
guns
we
have
bigger
guns
lets
go
get
em
they
botched
it
from
day
one
they
shouldnt
have
been
there
in
the
first
place
the
above
conveniently
ignores
the
murder
of
four
batf
agents
by
the
branch
davidians
in
an
unprovoked
ambush
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a
warant
on
the
place
by
ludicrously
underarmed
and
unprotected
police
if
anyone
on
the
net
cares
to
suggest
a
sure
fire
method
of
bringing
the
murderes
of
four
police
officers
to
justice
perhaps
we
could
hear
it
