STEVE
HENDRICKS
WRITES
ON
A
CASE
BY
CASE
BASIS
THE
COSTBENEFIT
RATIO
OF
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
IS
OBVIOUSLY
WORTHWHILE
THE
LIBERTARIAN
AGENDA
HOWEVER
DOES
NOT
CALL
FOR
THIS
ASSESSMENT
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
COSTS
OF
REGULATION
OF
ANY
KIND
ALWAYS
OUTWEIGH
ITS
BENEFITS
THIS
APPROACH
AVOIDS
ALL
SORTS
OF
DIFFICULT
ANALYSIS
BUT
IT
STRIKES
MANY
OF
THE
REST
OF
US
AS
DOGMATIC
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
I
ASSUME
YOU
MEAN
THAT
ANALYZING
THE
COSTBENEFIT
RATIO
OF
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
ON
A
CASE
BY
CASE
BASIS
IS
WORTHWHILE
LET
ME
SUGGEST
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
OPTION
REGULATORS
REGULATE
ITS
WHAT
THEY
DO
IM
NOT
SURE
WHY
YOU
DONT
CONSIDER
IT
AN
OPTION
NO
ONE
SUGGESTS
THAT
SUCH
ANALYSIS
SHOULD
BE
LEFT
TO
REGULATORS
IN
FACT
THE
REINVENTING
GOVERNMENT
MOVEMENT
PROVIDES
JUST
SUCH
A
COSTBENEFIT
APPROACH
TO
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
PUBLIC
SPENDING
LIBERTARIANS
WOULD
DO
WELL
TO
LEARN
MORE
ABOUT
IT
IT
MIGHT
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
PASS
AN
AMENDMENT
WHICH
WOULD
PREVENT
ANY
LISCENSING
LAWS
FROM
BEING
VALID
ASSUMING
YOU
COULD
CONVINCE
PEOPLE
THAT
IT
WOULD
OVERALL
BE
A
GOOD
IDEA
ELIMINATING
THE
LISCENSING
LAWS
WHICH
SERVE
NO
GOOD
PURPOSE
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
THEM
WHILE
MAINTAINING
THE
WORTHWHILE
ONES
ASSUMING
THERE
ARE
ANY
IS
NOT
FEASIBLE
SORRY
BUT
IT
STRIKES
ME
THAT
IT
IS
THE
ONLY
FEASIBLE
APPROACH
WHAT
IS
NOT
FEASIBLE
IS
A
WHOLESALE
ATTACK
ON
ALL
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
AND
LICENSING
THAT
TREATS
CUTTING
HAIR
AND
PRACTICING
MEDICINE
AS
EQUIVALENT
TASKS
I
HAVE
NO
OBJECTION
TO
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
MEDICAL
CARE
EDUCATION
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
OR
LOCAL
POLICE
THAT
SUGGESTS
A
FREE
MARKET
CAN
PROVIDE
A
MORE
EFFECTIVE
EFFICIENT
MEANS
OF
ACCOMPLISHING
SOCIAL
OBJECTIVES
THAN
IS
PROVIDED
THROUGH
STATIST
APPROACHES
WITH
SOME
NOTABLE
EXCEPTIONS
HOWEVER
I
DO
NOT
SEE
SUCH
NITTYGRITTY
WORTHWHILE
ANALYSIS
BEING
CARRIED
OUT
BY
SELFPROFESSED
LIBERTARIANS
JSH
I
NOTE
THAT
THE
ABOVE
EXAMPLES
TEND
TO
BE
AMONG
THE
FEW
GOVERNMENT
AREAS
LIKELY
TO
WIN
SOME
APPROVAL
AMONG
LIBERTARIANS
ANYWAY
ACTUALLY
THE
ONLY
AREAS
OF
PUBLIC
SPENDING
ABOVE
THAT
STRIKE
ME
AS
GENERATING
SUBSTANTIAL
SUPPORT
AMONG
LIBERTARIANS
ARE
POLICE
AND
DEFENSE
IT
IS
AN
INTERESTING
ASIDE
THAT
AS
COMMITTED
AS
LIBERTARIANS
CLAIM
TO
BE
TO
A
PRINCIPLE
OF
NONCOERCION
THE
ONLY
AREAS
OF
PUBLIC
SPENDING
THAT
THEY
FREQUENTLY
SUPPORT
INVOLVE
HIRING
PEOPLE
WITH
GUNSHMMM
THE
MOST
OBJECTIONABLE
GOVERNMENT
EXPENDITURES
ARE
ENTITLEMENTS
WHICH
ALSO
ARE
THE
BIGGEST
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS
WILL
SUGGEST
THAT
THESE
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
DEFENSE
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
THEY
ARE
A
SORT
OF
DANEGELD
TO
WOULDBE
REVOLUTIONARIES
BUT
I
PERSONALLY
DONT
FEEL
WE
HAVE
MUCH
TO
FEAR
FROM
AN
ALLIANCE
OF
GEEZERS
AND
UNWED
MOTHERS
MAYBE
IVE
LED
TOO
SHELTERED
A
LIFE
PERHAPS
YOU
HAVE

I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
CONSIDER
THAT
REVOLUTIONARIES
FREQUENTLY
GENERATE
SUPPORT
BY
ACTING
AS
PROTECTORS
OF
GEEZERS
MOTHERS
AND
CHILDREN
GOVERNMENTS
THAT
IGNORE
SUCH
PEOPLE
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
WE
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
TO

FROM

DO
SO
