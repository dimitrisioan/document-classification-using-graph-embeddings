CHRIS

WRITES
ITS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THAT
A
BUYER
AND
SELLER
WILL
BOTH
TRUST
SOME
THIRD
PARTY
MORE
THAN
EITHER
TRUST
THE
OTHER
AND
WILL
DESIRE
THE
MODERATION
OF
THAT
THIRD
PARTY
BUT
IF
A
RANDOM
THIRD
PARTY
ASSUMES
THE
RIGHT
TO
INTERFERE
IN
A
TRANSACTION
CONTARARY
TO
THE
WISHES
OF
THE
PRIMARY
PARTICIPANTS
ODDS
ARE
PRETTY
GOOD
THE
RESULTS
WILL
BE
DETRIMENTAL
SO
WE
TRY
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
PROCESS
OF
DECIDING
WHETHER
TO
INTRODUCE
THIRD
PARTIES
ISNT
RANDOM
AS
STEVE
SAID
ABOVE
THERE
ARE
EXAMPLES
WHERE
THIRD
PARTIES
ARE
LESS
IGNORANT
OR
CORRUPT
THAN
THE
TWO
PRIMARY
PARTIES
SHOULD
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
HELP
A
THIRD
PARTY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
PERSUASION
TO
SWAY
THE
TRANSACTION
IF
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WE
CONDONE
THE
USE
OF
FORCE
OR
THREAT
OF
VIOLENCE
BY
THE
THIRD
PARTY
THEN
WE
ARE
IN
TROUBLE
A
FOURTH
PARTY
COULD
SAY
THAT
IT
KNOWS
BETTER
THAN
PARTIES
AND
AND
A
FIFTH
PARTY
AND
SO
ON
WHO
WINS
THE
ONE
THAT
CAN
USE
THE
FORCE
OR
THREAT
OF
FORCE
THE
BEST
IN
OTHER

MIGHT
MAKES

LETS
ABANDON
SUCH
AGGRESSIVE
