the
difference
in
the
litigation
environment
is
reflected
in
the
fees
lack
of
defensive
medicine
and
nearabsence
of
malpractice
is
really
why
we
spend
less
using
the
most
expensive
approach
of
pure
insurance
then
why
do
we
really
need
national
health
insurance
then
wouldnt
it
just
make
more
sense
to
find
some
way
to
cut
down
on
the
cost
of
malpractice
insurance
it
would
if
malpractice
and
defensive
medicine
were
the
main
factors
in
explaining
spiralling
us
health
care
costs
but
they
arent
although
gary
is
correct
in
noting
that
malpracticerelated
problems
are
greater
in
the
us
than
canada
they
by
no
means
account
for
the
overall
difference
in
health
care
costs
they
do
account
for
a
somewhat
larger
portion
of
the
difference
in
physicians
gross
income
in
the
two
countries
some
facts
malpractice
insurance
and
awards
account
for
less
than
of
total
health
care
costs
in
the
us
in
according
to
a
survey
of
physicians
conducted
by
a
national
medical
journal
physicians
averaged
paying
of
their
practice
receipts
in
malpractice
insurance
malpractice
insurance
premiums
and
malpractice
awards
peaked
in
theyve
declined
significantly
since
then
at
the
same
time
health
care
costs
have
increased
more
than
any
period
in
history
as
far
as
defensive
medicine
is
concerned
the
ama
estimates
that
its
total
impact
is
about
billion
per
year
thats
about
of
the
total
current
increase
in
health
care
costs
and
the
estimate
is
from
a
group
that
could
be
expected
to
overestimate
the
impacts
of
defensive
medicine
on
health
care
as
small
a
problem
as
this
is
in
the
overall
scheme
of
things
however
clinton
has
been
on
record
for
a
long
time
favoring
an
indemnification
of
mds
against
malpractice
suits
if
they
follow
procedures
set
by
their
specialties
this
would
eliminate
most
if
not
all
frivolous
suits
while
retaining
the
ability
to
sue
for
true
malpractice
