I
THOUGHT
I
WAS
CLEAR
BECAUSE
HOMOSEXUALS
SUPPORT
LAWS
TO
FORCE
EMPLOYMENT
OF
HOMOSEXUALS
AGAINST
THE
WILL
OF
SOME
EMPLOYERS
THEY
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
INTERFERE
WITH
PRIVATE
ACTS
BETWEEN
MUTUALLY
CONSENTING
ADULTS
OK
ILL
LEAVE
OTHERS
TO
DISCUSS
YOUR
USE
OF
STATISTICS
BUT
I
THINK
IM
ABLE
TO
DISCUSS
LIBERTERIAN
IDEAS
THE
IDEAS
ARE
GOOD
THEY
SEEK
TO
MAXIMISE
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHTS
BY
KEEPING
GOVERNMENTS
OUT
OF
TRANSACTIONS
BETWEEN
CONSENTING
ADULTS
IF
AN
EMPLOYER
WANTS
TO
DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST
A
GROUP
SHEHE
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
TO
MAXIMISE
THEIR
FREEDOM
THE
DISCRIMINATEES
CAN
GO
ELSEWHERE
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
DOESNT
RELATE
TO
MAXIMISING
TOTAL
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHTS
WITHIN
A
COMMUNITY
IF
AN
EMPLOYER
OR
SHOPKEEPER
OR
WHATEVER
CAN
DISCRIMINATE
IN
THIS
WAY
THEN
THE
FREEDOM
OF
THE
DISCRIMINATEE
GOES
DOWN
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
LIVE
IN
PERFECT
ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS
WITH
PERFECT
MOBILITY
UNLIMITED
NUMBERS
OF
POTENTIAL
EMPLOYERS
OF
THEIR
SKILLS
UNLIMITED
PLACES
TO
BUY
GOODS
THE
LIBERTERIAN
ARGUMENT
LEADS
TO
A
DECREASE
IN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
LIBERTY
IN
THE
COMMUNITY
YOU
MEAN
IF
A
LARGE
PART
OF
THE
POPULATION
SUPPORTS
DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALS
THEY
WILL
BE
INJURED
BUT
IF
A
LARGE
PART
OF
THE
POPULATION
SUPPORTS
SUCH
DISCRIMINATION
HOW
DID
THAT
LAW
GET
PASSED
