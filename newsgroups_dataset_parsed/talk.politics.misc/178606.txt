i
note
with
insufficient
emotion
that
amongst
the
five
survivors
of
the
waco
debacle
there
were
two
brits
and
an
aussie
the
anglosaxon
persona
really
doesnt
lend
itself
to
martyrdom
for
a
spurious
messiah
i
dont
see
how
you
draw
that
conclusion
around
of
the
inside
the
buildings
were
british
one
quarter
two
out
of
the
eight
latest
count
i
heard
survivors
were
british
one
quarter
anyhow
british
doesnt
equate
to
anglosaxon
what
exactly
are
you
trying
to
say
and
why
were
there
no
fireengines
within
a
mile
of
the
compound
because
the
gun
loonies
were
firing
on
vehicles
with
amunition
that
has
a
range
of
meters
what
crap
phil
wrong
to
give
you
a
clue
as
to
how
big
is
the
fighter
aircraft
have
gattling
guns
used
to
shoot
down
other
aircraft
a
gun
would
be
somewhere
in
the
cannon
realm
they
might
have
had
calibre
but
definitely
not
