I
NOTE
WITH
INSUFFICIENT
EMOTION
THAT
AMONGST
THE
FIVE
SURVIVORS
OF
THE
WACO
DEBACLE
THERE
WERE
TWO
BRITS
AND
AN
AUSSIE
THE
ANGLOSAXON
PERSONA
REALLY
DOESNT
LEND
ITSELF
TO
MARTYRDOM
FOR
A
SPURIOUS
MESSIAH
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
YOU
DRAW
THAT
CONCLUSION
AROUND
OF
THE
INSIDE
THE
BUILDINGS
WERE
BRITISH
ONE
QUARTER
TWO
OUT
OF
THE
EIGHT
LATEST
COUNT
I
HEARD
SURVIVORS
WERE
BRITISH
ONE
QUARTER
ANYHOW
BRITISH
DOESNT
EQUATE
TO
ANGLOSAXON
WHAT
EXACTLY
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
SAY
AND
WHY
WERE
THERE
NO
FIREENGINES
WITHIN
A
MILE
OF
THE
COMPOUND
BECAUSE
THE
GUN
LOONIES
WERE
FIRING
ON
VEHICLES
WITH
AMUNITION
THAT
HAS
A
RANGE
OF
METERS
WHAT
CRAP
PHIL
WRONG
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
CLUE
AS
TO
HOW
BIG
IS
THE
FIGHTER
AIRCRAFT
HAVE
GATTLING
GUNS
USED
TO
SHOOT
DOWN
OTHER
AIRCRAFT
A
GUN
WOULD
BE
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
CANNON
REALM
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
HAD
CALIBRE
