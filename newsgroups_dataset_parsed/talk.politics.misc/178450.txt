FKING
GOOD
CASE
THE
DEFENSE
LAWYER
ASKED
THE

QUESTIONS
LIKE
WHAT
KIND
OF
SEXUAL
PERVERSIONS
DO
YOU
PARTICIPATE

AND
YOU
THINK
HE
MADE
A
GOOD
CASE
SPEAKING
AS
SOMEONE
WHOS

ABOUT
SIX
WEEKS
AND
A
TUITION
BILL
AWAY
FROM
BECOMING

TRIAL
ID
ESPECIALLY
LIKE
TO

WHAT
HAPPENED
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THE
DEFENSE
ATTORNEY
ASKED
THAT
QUESTION
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
REPORTS
THAT
HE
DID
SO
ARE
ACCURATE
IM
NOT
ACCUSING
TOM
FARRELL
OF
MAKING
ANYTHING

THIS
IS
THE
SORT
OF

GARBLED
MISQUOTES
FALSE

OBJECTED
IRRELEVANT
PREJUDICIAL
INFLAMMATORY
TAKE
YOUR
PICK
AND
THAT
THE
JUDGE
UPHELD
THE
OBJECTION
I

UPDATE
OF
THE
CASE
THEY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
ONGOING
TRIAL
AND
HAD
SOME
AUDIO
CLIPS
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THE
DEFENSE
ATTORNEY
ASKED
THE
QUESTION
THERE
WAS
AN
OBJECTION
HEARD
IN
THE
BACKGROUND
THE
CLIP
ENDED
AT
THAT
POINT
SO
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THE
OBJECTION
WAS
UPHELD
I
CANT
IMAGINE
NC
IS
THAT
BAD
THE
ARRESTING
OFFICER
SAID
THE
BASTARDS
TOLD
HIM
THEY
DID
IT
ON
PURPOSE
AND
HOPED
THE
VICTIM
WOULD
DIE

A
GOOD
CASE

WONDER
WERE
LOSING
WERE
APARENTLY
NOT
TRYING
TO
WIN
AGAIN
