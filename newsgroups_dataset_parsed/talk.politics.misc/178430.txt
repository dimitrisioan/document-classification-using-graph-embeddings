WRITES
OUCH
NOW
THAT
REALLY
HURTS
IM
BEING
ACCUSED
OF
NO
BREADTH
NOR
DEPTH
TO
MY
HISTORICAL
KNOWLEDGE
BECAUSE
IM
UNWILLING
TO
AGREE
THAT
ECONOMIC
INEQUALITY
LEADS
TO
POVERTY
AND
FROM
THERE
TO
SOCIAL
AND
POLITICAL
INSTABILITY
YOU
GO
READ
YOUR
HISTORY
AGAIN
POVERTY
IS
THE
MAIN
ENGINE
OF
SOCIAL
INSTABILITY
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
WELL
PUT
ASIDE
RELIGIOUS
TURMOIL
MASS
MIGRATIONS
ETC
WELL
THE
FACT
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
THAT
POVERTY
IS
IMPERFECTLY
RELATED
TO
SOCIAL
AND
POLITICAL
INSTABILITY
WHILE
ECONOMIC
INEQUALITY
IS
MUCH
MORE
STRONGLY
RELATED
IN
VIRTUALLY
ALL
MAJOR
REVOLUTIONS
INCLUDING
ENGLAND
THE
PURITAN
REVOLUTION
FRANCE
RUSSIA
AND
CHINA
THE
REVOLUTIONS
OCCURRED
AS
ECONOMIES
WERE
UNDERGOING
SUBSTANTIAL
LONG
TERM
GROWTH
AND
POVERTY
WAS
DECLINING
WHAT
SETS
OFF
REVOLUTIONS
IS
MASSIVE
INEQUALITY
COUPLED
WITH
A
PERCEPTION
ON
THE
PART
OF
THOSE
AT
THE
BOTTOM
THAT
SOCIAL
CHANGE
IS
POSSIBLE
IF
POVERTY
WERE
THE
MAIN
ENGINE
OF
SOCIAL
INSTABILITY
THIS
TYPICAL
HISTORICAL
PATTERN
WOULD
NOT
HOLD
IN
FACT
REVOLUTIONS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
FAR
MORE
TYPICAL
BEFORE
THE
NINETEENTH
CENTURY
THAN
SINCE
THAT
TIME
MUCH
DELETED
GEE
JIM
IF
YOULL
CHECK
THE
CONSTITUTION
YOULL
FIND
IN
ORDER
TO
PROMOTE
THE
GENERAL
WELFAREDO
ORDAIN
AND
ESTABLISH
THIS
CONSTITUTION
IM
SURPRISED
YOU
MISSED
IT
ITS
RIGHT
THERE
IN
THE
FIRST
PARAGRAPH
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
AT
LEAST
THROUGH
THE
PREAMBLE
YOU
ALMOST
GOT
IT
RIGHT
AND
IT
WAS
A
GOOD
TRY
BUT
YOU
SHOULD
FOLLOW
YOUR
OWN
ADVICE
THE
PREAMBLE
TO
THE
CONSTITUTION
DOES
READ
AS
YOU
HAVE
QUOTED
BUT
LET
US
NOT
FORGET
THAT
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
ONLY
THE
PREAMBLE
IT
IS
NOT
A
BINDING
PART
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
CARRIES
NO
WEIGHT
IN
THE
LAW
THAT
POOR
TORTURED
PARAGRAPH
HAS
GOT
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
UNFORTUNATE
PASSAGES
IN
THE
ENGLISH
LANGUAGE
WITNESS
THE
LEGIONS
OF
BLOWHARDS
LIKE
YOURSELF
WHO
THINK
THOSE
VAGUE
FLOWERY
PHRASES
ARE
PART
OF
THE
LAW
OF
THE
LAND
DO
YOU
REALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
A
POLITICIAN
ONLY
HAS
TO
GIVE
LIP
SERVICE
TO
PROMOTING
THE
GENERAL
WELFARE
TO
BE
WITHIN
THE
LIMITS
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
SORRY
BUDDY
BUT
SOME
OTHER
BLOWHARDS
MANAGED
TO
INCLUDE
THE
GENERAL
WELFARE
IN
ANOTHER
PORTION
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION

THE

I
GUESS
THEY
WANTED
TO
MAKE
SURE
EVERYONE
UNDERSTOOD
THEY
MEANT
WHAT
THEY
SAID
IN
THE
PREAMBLE
JUST
TO
MAKE
SURE
YOUVE
GOT
THE
POINT
LETS
DO
A
LITTLE
EXPERIMENT
WHAT
IF
THE

READ
AS

WE
THE

FUNCTION
AND

FUNCTION

BUT
AS
NOTED
ABOVE
THE
CONSTITUTION
DOESNT
SAY
THAT
DOES
IT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WOULD
NOT
THEN
HAVE
TWO
FUNCTIONS
DEFENSE
AND
WELFARE
BUT
SINCE
IT
EXPLICITLY
INCLUDES
BOTH
THE
