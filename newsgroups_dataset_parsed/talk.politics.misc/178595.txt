i
think
you
are
while
both
organizations
may
on
paper
support
the
abolition
of
the
age
of
consent

the

stops
one
supports
the
removal
of
a
coercive
law
the
other
a
paper
facade
to
legitimize
sexual
relations
with
children
i
get
it
one
organization
wants
to
abolish
age
of
consent
laws
whereas
in
contrast
the
other
wants
to
abolish
age
of
consent
laws
this
makes
it
respectable
to
belong
to
one
organization
but
not
the
other
