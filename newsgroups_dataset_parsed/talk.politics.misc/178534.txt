NO
IM
SAYING
ANY

INVESTOR
THE
ONES
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
LARGE
CAPITAL
GAINS
WOULD
BE
FOOLISH
TO
SELL
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
A
TAX
HIKE
THAT
A
MIGHT
DISAPPEAR
IN
ANY
GIVEN
YEAR
AND
B
BE
OVERCOME
IN
A

OR

BY
ACCUMLATED

TO

MY

ISSO

NOT

PEOPLE
WHO

GAINS
TAXES
ARE
LONG

INVESTORS
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
OF
THEM
ARENT
FOR
THERE
TO
BE
HUGE
BLIP
WHENEVER
CAPITAL
GAINS
TAXES
GET
RAISED
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
EVERYONE
WOULD
FIND
THIS
ADVANTAGEOUS
I
SAID
THAT
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
WOULD
FOR
THE
RESULT
TO
BE
READILY
NOTICEABLE

DISTORT

EVEN
IF

WERE

WERENT

STILL
BE

ABOUT
THE

FOR
THE

NOTES
NOT
EVERYONE

A

ONE
MIGHT
FIND
ONESELF
AS
I
DID
IN

ANTICIPATING
EXPENSES
IN
THE
NEAR

THAT
REQUIRE
SELLING
OFF

GIVEN
THE
CHOICE
BETWEEN
WAITING
A
FEW

AND
TAKING
AN
EXTRA
TAX
HIT
OR
SELLING
IN

WITH
PREFERENTIAL
TAX
TREATMENT
ONLY
A
FOOL
WOULD
CHOOSE

THE
FACT
THAT

CALCULATIONS
OF
WHAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN

BENEFICIAL
TO

IS
IN
MANY
RESPECTS
BESIDE
THE
POINT
THERE
WAS
PLENTY
OF
MONEYSTYLE
ADVICE
GIVEN
TO
UNSOPHISTICATED
INVESTORS
IN
LATE
TO
SELL
NOW
AND
SAVE
ON
TAXES
IN
CASE
ANYONE
MISSED
IT
THERE
WAS
NO
SHORTAGE
OF
SIMILAR
ADVICE
LATE
LAST
YEAR
IN
THE
NYTIMES
EG
EVEN
THOUGH
THAT
ADVICE
WAS
BASED
NOT
ON
THE
FOREGONE
CONCLUSION
OF
ENACTED
LAW
AS
IN
BUT
MERELY
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
CLINTON
WOULD
RAISE
TAX
RATES
WITHOUT
CAPPING
CG
TAXES
CONTRARY
TO
THE
CURRENT
PROPOSAL
ITS
NICE
TO
THINK
THAT
INVESTORS
ALWAYS
BEHAVE
IN
THEIR
OPTIMAL
ECONOMIC
INTEREST
LIKE
ASSUMING
WEIGHTLESS
ROPES
AND
FRICTIONLESS
PULLEYS
THOUGH
THIS
SORT
OF
THINKING
OFTEN
FAILS
TO
DESCRIBE
ACCURATELY
WHAT
HAPPENS
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
MORAL
ALWAYS
CHOOSE
THE
RIGHT
SORT
OF
PARENTS
BEFORE
YOU
START
IN
TO

ROUGH
