A
RATIONAL
VIEWPOINT
WAS
RE
NEW
STUDY
OUT
ON
GAY
PERCENTAGE
IN
ARTICLE
DANSUXACSOUIUCEDU
DAN
S
WRITES
DONT
FORGET
ABOUT
THE
CULTURE
SADLY
WE
DONT
AS
A
SOCIETY
LOOK
UPON
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
NORMAL
AND
AS
WE
ARE
ALL
TOO
WELL
AWARE
THERE
ARE
ALOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
CONDEMN
IT
AS
A
RESULT
THE
GAY
POPULATION
IS
NOT
ENCOURAGED
TO
DEVELOP
NONPROMISCUOUS
RELATIONSHIPS
IN
FACT
THERE
ARE
MANY
ROADBLOCKS
PUT
IN
THE
WAY
OF
SUCH
COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIPS
IT
IS
AS
IF
THE
HETEROSEXUAL
COMMUNITY
PUTS
THESE
BLOCKS
THERE
SO
AS
TO
PERPETUATE
THE
CLAIM
THAT
GAYS
ARE
IMMORAL
MY
IF
WE
ALLOWED
GAYS
TO
MARRY
RAISE
CHILDREN
WE
MIGHT
JUST
FIND
OUT
THEYRE
AS
MORAL
AS
WE
ARE
CANT
HAVE
THAT
CAN
WE
JUST
SOME
THOUGHTS
FLAME
AWAY
DAN
THIS
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
POINT
ONE
THAT
I
HAVE
HELD
FOR
SOMETIME
WE
DO
NOT
ALLOW
PEOPLE
TO
DEVELOP
ON
THE
PATHS
THAT
THEY
CHOOSE
OR
DESIRE
EVEN
WITH
HETEROSEXUALS
WE
TEND
TO
LEAVE
SOME
HANGING
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
INFORMATION
ABOUT
SEXUALITY
AND
RELATIONSHIPS
IT
IS
VERY
DIFFICULT
FOR
A
YOUNG
PERSON
TO
DEVELOP
AND
BUILD
A
POSITIVE
VIEW
OF
THEMSELF
WHEN
THEY
ARE
CONSTANTLY
BEING
TOLD
IMPLICITLY
AND
EXPLICITLY
THAT
THEY
ARE
WRONG
AND
IMMORAL
THE
CONCEPTS
ABOUT
PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE
DEEPLY
EMBEDDED
IN
EMOTIONALISM
AND
FEAR
THESE
FEARS
COVER
A
WIDE
RANGE
BUT
MOSTLY
JEALOUSY
AND
LACK
OF
TRUST
SEEM
TO
BE
CORNERSTONES
OF
MODERN
DAY
AMERICAN
RELATIONSHIPS
WE
ALSO
SET
ON
TOP
OF
THIS
THE
CONCEPTS
OF
MADISON
AVENUE
ATTRACTIVENESS
AND
STANDARDS
AND
PUT
THE
PRESSURE
ON
TO
MEASURE
UP
