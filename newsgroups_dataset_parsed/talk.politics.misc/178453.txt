STEVE

WRITES
OKAY
LET
ME
TRY
TO
EXPLAIN
THIS
WHEN
ONE
VOTES
FOR
SUCH
A
CREATURE
AS
A
SENATOR
OR
WORSE
YET
A
PRESIDENT
ONE
VOTES
NOT
FOR
SPECIFIC
POLICIES
BUT
FOR
A
GENERAL
PACKAGE
WHICH
MUST
COVER
ALL
ISSUES
FOR
OR
YEARS
AS
SUCH
ONES
INFLUENCE
IS
HIGHLY
DILUTED
I
MIGHT
ADD
THAT
EVEN
IF
ONE
WERE
FREE
TO
VOTE
ON
INDIVIDUAL
REGULATIONS
THE
VAST
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
REQUIRED
FOR
CONSIDERING
A
PARTICULAR
REGULATION
COMBINED
WITH
THE
VERY
SMALL
CHANCE
OF
ONES
VOTE
MAKING
A
DIFFERENCE
WOULD
MAKE
IT
UNREASONABLE
TO
EXPECT
THE
VOTER
TO
MAKE
AN
INTELLIGENT
DECISION
WITH
RESPECT
TO
SPECIFIC
REGULATIONS
IM
AFRAID
THAT
IVE
LOST
THE
THREAD
HERE
I
DIDNT
SUGGEST
THAT
ALL
GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS
BE
SUBJECT
TO
REFERENDA
SO
I
DONT
FOLLOW
THE
COMMENTS
ABOVE
SORRY
BUT
IT
STRIKES
ME
THAT
IT
IS
THE
ONLY
FEASIBLE
APPROACH
WHAT
IS
NOT
FEASIBLE
IS
A
WHOLESALE
ATTACK
ON
ALL
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
AND
LICENSING
THAT
TREATS
CUTTING
HAIR
AND
PRACTICING
MEDICINE
AS
EQUIVALENT
TASKS
IM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
FEASIBLE
IN
THIS
CASE
DO
YOU
MEAN
THAT
ARE
IMPOSSIBLE
IN
PRICIPLE
OR
MERELY
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
UNDESIRABLE
IN
FACT
I
MEAN
THAT
AN
IDEOLOGY
THAT
TREATS
ALL
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
AS
EQUALLY
UNDESIRABLE
AND
SEEKS
TO
ABOLISH
ALL
REGULATIONS
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
DRAW
SUPPORT
AMONG
MORE
THAN
A
MINISCULE
PORTION
OF
THE
ELECTORATE
FURTHERMORE
I
AM
SUGGESTING
THAT
SUCH
A
PLAN
IS
NOT
FEASIBLE
IN
AN
INDUSTRIAL
SOCIETY
BECAUSE
THE
WEIGHT
OF
LITIGATION
ANDOR
MISERY
IT
WOULD
PRODUCE
WOULD
EFFECTIVELY
CRUSH
PRODUCTIVE
EFFORT
ACTUALLY
THE
ONLY
AREAS
OF
PUBLIC
SPENDING
ABOVE
THAT
STRIKE
ME
AS
GENERATING
SUBSTANTIAL
SUPPORT
AMONG
LIBERTARIANS
ARE
POLICE
AND
DEFENSE
IT
IS
AN
INTERESTING
ASIDE
THAT
AS
COMMITTED
AS
LIBERTARIANS
CLAIM
TO
BE
TO
A
PRINCIPLE
OF
NONCOERCION
THE
ONLY
AREAS
OF
PUBLIC
SPENDING
THAT
THEY
FREQUENTLY
SUPPORT
INVOLVE
HIRING
PEOPLE
WITH
GUNSHMMM
YOU
SAY
THIS
AS
IF
IT
WERE
SURPRISING
YET
IN
FACT
A
NECESSARY
CONSEQUENCE
OF
LIBERTARIAN
PHILOSOPHY
ALL
NONCOERSIVE
FUNCTIONS
SHOULD
BE
DEALT
WITH
PRIVATELY
THEREFORE
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
THE
ONLY
FUNCTIONS
REMAINING
TO
THE
STATE
ARE
THE
COERSIVE
ONES
NO
IM
NOT
SURPRISED
I
JUST
THINK
ITS
INTERESTING
THAT
ON
ONE
HAND
LIBERTARIANS
ASSUME
A
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
CAN
BE
DECREED
YET
ON
THE
OTHER
POSIT
AN
ENTIRE
GOVERNMENT
MADE
UP
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
CARRY
GUNS
I
REALIZE
THAT
MANY
LIBERTARIANS
ASSUME
THAT
SUCH
A
GOVERNMENT
WILL
BE
COUNTERBALANCED
BY
A
FULLY
ARMED
CITIZENRY
BUT
IT
IS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
WIDESPREAD
CIVILIAN
OWNERSHIP
OF
GUNS
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
PREVENT
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
TOTALITARIAN
GOVERNMENT
EG
IRAQ
PERHAPS
YOU
HAVE
MAY
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
CONSIDER
THAT
REVOLUTIONARIES
FREQUENTLY
GENERATE
SUPPORT
BY
ACTING
AS
PROTECTORS
OF
GEEZERS
MOTHERS
AND
CHILDREN
GOVERNMENTS
THAT
IGNORE
SUCH
PEOPLE
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
WE
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
TO
FEAR
FROM
THEM
DO
SO
AT
THEIR
OWN
PERIL
MUCH
MORE
LIKELY
ITS
DRUNKEN
TEENAGERS
THE
GROUPS
IN
QUESTIONARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
WORSE
OFF
DURING
AND
AFTER
A
REVOLUTION
THAN
BEFORE
IN
THE
UNLIKELY
EVENT
THAT
YOU
MISSED
MY
EARLIER
SARCASM
LET
ME
SAY
THIS
DIRECTLY
THE
IDEA
THAT
SUCH
PROGRAMS
AS
SOCIAL
SECURITY
OR
AFDC
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
DEFENSE
AN
IDEA
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
ADVANCED
IN
THS
AND
OTHER
NEWSGROUPS
IS
SO
ABSURD
A
LIE
AS
TO
BE
UNWORTHY
OF
CONSIDERATION
DO
YOU
SERIOUSLY
DISPUTE
THIS
YUP
SURE
DO
BUT
SINCE
I
ALSO
SUPPORT
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
REQUIREMENT
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROVIDE
FOR
THE
GENERAL
WELFARE
ARTICLE
I
SECTION
IM
WILLING
TO
JUSTIFY
SUCH
PROGRAMS
ON
THAT
BASIS
I
DONT
WANT
TO
SEEM
PATRONIZING
BUT
YOU
STILL
SEEM
TO
BE
LABORING
UNDER
THE
DELUSION
THAT
UNDER
A
SOCIALIZED
ECONOMIC
SYSTEM
IT
IS
REASONABLY
INTELLIGENT
AND
HONEST
PERSONS
LIKE
YOURSELF
WHO
MAKE
THE
DECISIONS
I
FEEL
ANY
THIRD
PARTY
ADDED
TO
A
TRANSACTION
IS
EVERY
BIT
AS
LIKELY
TO
BE
IGNORANT
OR
CORRUPT
AS
THE
BUYER
OR
SELLER
I
DONT
EXPECT
YOU
TO
AGREE
WITH
ME
BUT
YOU
EXPLAIN
WHY
YOU
FEEL
IM
WRONG
WELL
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
I
DONT
SUPPORT
A
SOCIALIZED
ECONOMIC
SYSTEM
I
THINK
WITHIN
LIMITS
THAT
CAPITALISM
IS
A
FINE
IDEA
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
THAT
ANY
THIRD
PARTYISAS
LIKELY
TO
BE
IGNORANT
OR
CORRUPT
AS
THE
BUYER
OR
SELLER
THERE
ARE
MULTITUDES
OF
EXAMPLES
WHERE
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
IS
DEMONSTRABLY
FALSE
REGULATION
OF
STOCK
MARKET
TRANSACTIONS
THAT
PROVIDE
A
REASONABLE
BASIS
FOR
BUYERS
TO
AVOID
FRAUD
IS
ONLY
ONE
