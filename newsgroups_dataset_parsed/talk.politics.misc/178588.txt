heres
my
own
top
ten
response
to
mr
ipsers
list
it
just
so
happens
that
that
it
takes
money
to
make
this
country
work
to
provide
the
services
that
people
need
and
to
help
solve
the
problems
that
need
to
be
solved
granted
some
things
can
probably
be
done
more
efficiently
for
less
money
and
should
be
but
some
things
are
going
to
cost
more
money
and
im
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
everyone
whining
about
taxes
all
the
time
you
want
to
live
in
my
country
you
pay
your
fair
share
some
people
pay
shares
that
are
more
fair
than
others
and
will
continue
to
do
so
even
with
the
presence
of
president
clinton
until
the
rich
elite
hurt
from
taxes
and
shower
me
with
their
blood
dripping
from
the
wound
of
the
tax
dagger
i
will
scream
and
yell
because
taxes
are
killing
the
poor
and
middleclass
and
im
tired
of
the
wealthy
getting
a
free
ride
in
this
country
sure
they
pay
a
lot
of
taxes
but
i
want
them
to
share
my
pain
and
not
even
slick
willy
is
that
fair
is
he
seeing
that
he
and
his
wife
qualify
as
one
of
those
wealthy
people
i
was
talking
about
theyre
on
the
lower
end
of
wealthy
but
wealthy
they
are
i
cant
believe
what
hypocrites
people
are
when
they
ask
people
to
give
up
their
lives
for
their
country
and
then
complain
about
taxes
if
youre
willing
to
send
me
off
to
die
for
some
stupid
obsession
with
fighting
an
enemy
which
at
best
doesnt
affect
us
and
at
worst
really
should
be
our
friend
then
you
have
no
right
to
tell
me
you
shouldnt
pay
taxes
yah
i
think
the
draft
for
vietnam
was
a
sack
of
shit
but
do
we
get
to
pick
and
choose
which
laws
we
obey
mr
chaudhary
if
so
shall
we
set
up
a
you
follow
the
laws
you
like
and
ill
follow
the
laws
i
like
arrangement
hey
i
think
the
beaded
curtains
add
a
lovely
touch
i
never
thought
much
of
beaded
curtains
now
beaded
seatcovers
on
the
other
hand
health
care
is
a
human
rightdeleted
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
respond
to
this
but
i
changed
my
mind
tell
me
why
do
you
think
health
care
is
a
human
right
this
isnt
a
flame
or
anything
i
just
wonder
next
thing
you
know
free
public
transportation
will
be
a
human
right
maybe
membership
at
prestigious
health
spas
sorry
to
grease
the
hill
on
ya
there
make
love
not
war
be
sure
and
wrap
that
wanker
when
you
go
spreadin
that
free
love
stuff
around
or
after
the
fda
gets
its
thumb
out
of
its
ass
use
that
neat
new
reality
femicondom
contrary
to
popular
belief
it
is
possible
to
be
a
male
and
a
feminist
at
the
same
time
to
discriminate
against
or
to
deny
equal
opportunity
to
a
majority
of
the
population
is
just
plain
wrong
and
trying
to
force
them
into
some
sort
of
tradition
role
is
even
worse
women
certainly
have
as
much
to
offer
this
world
as
men
and
the
day
that
gender
discrimination
is
finally
broken
it
going
to
make
all
the
revolutions
of
the
past
few
centuries
seem
like
reform
bills
i
look
forward
to
it
so
do
i
amen
and
all
that
hey
man
acadamia
rules
what
the
hell
is
an
acadamia
anyway
is
that
like
a
macadamia
cpk
its
been
days
do
you
know
where
your
wallet
is
slick
willys
already
got
his
hand
in
my
pocket
im
just
afraid
of
what
he
might
grab
hold
of
