when
you
force
people
to
associate
with
others
against
their
will
yes
you
are
forced
everyday
to
associate
with
people
that
you
do
not
wish
to
and
there
isnt
even
a
law
that
makes
you
do
it
but
you
do
becuase
you
want
to
go
shopping
or
go
to
work
or
go
to
a
public
park
or
go
to
a
baseball
game
etc
the
process
of
ending
discrimination
is
based
upon
the
rational
concept
that
all
men
women
people
are
created
equal
have
the
same
equal
standing
and
chances
in
society
