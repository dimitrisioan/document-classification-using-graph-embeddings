THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
SLAVERY
WAS
A
DYING
INSTITUTION

MADE
BY
IS
HISTORIANS
MAINLY
SOUTHERNERS
WHO
SOUGHT
TO
DIVERT
ATTENTION
FROM
THE
INSTITUTION
AS
THE
CENTRAL
ISSUE
OF
THE
CIVIL
WAR
IN
FACT
HOWEVER
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
SPECIOUS
AT
BEST
MORE
RECENT
SCHOLARSHIP
FROM
THE
LAST
YEARS
DEMONSTRATES
RATHER
CONCLUSIVELY
THAT
THE
COTTONSUGAR
TOBACCO
ECONOMY
AND
ITS
RELIANCE
ON
SLAVERY
WAS
INCREASINGLY
DOMINANT
IN
THE
SOUTH
PRIOR
TO
THE
CIVIL
WAR
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THE
SOUTH
DID
NOT
RECEIVE
THE
MASSIVE
MOMENTUM
OF
CAPITAL
INTENSIVE
GROWTH
THAT
THE
NORTHERN
STATES
DID
COMPARE
THE
NORTHERN
AGRICULTURAL
SYSTEM
WITH
THE
SOUTHERN
AND
YOU
WILL
SEE
A
MAJOR
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
CAPITAL
TO
LABOR
INTENSITY
CAPITAL
AND
LABOR
ARE
ONE
AND
THE
SAME
IN
A
SLAVE
ECONOMY
EXCEPT
THAT
CAPITAL
DOESNT
REPRODUCE
QUITE
AS
READILY
AS
SLAVES
DID
SLAVERY
WAS
A
DYING
INSTITUTION
BEFORE

GIN
YES
BUT
NOT
IN
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
COTTON
SUFFERED
FROM

DEPRESSION
IN
THE
THE
PERIOD
USED
TO
CLAIM
THAT
SLAVERY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
LASTED
IN
THE
SOUTH
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
I
HAVE
HEARD
IT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
LASTED
BECAUSE
THE
GROWTH
IN
THE
NORTH
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SUSTAINED
FOR
MUCH
LONGER
WITHOUT
SPILLING
OVER
TO
THE
SOUTHERN
STATES
IE
NORTHERN
INDUSTRY
WOULD
HAVE
MIGRATED
CAPITAL
TO
THE
SOUTHERN

AND
WITH
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
COME
IMMIGRANT
LABOR
TO
THE
PORTS
OF
THE
SOUTH
EG
CHARLESTON
SAVANNAH
MOBILE
NEW
ORLEANS
ETC
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
PUT
THE
BREAKS
ON
THE
SLAVE
MARKET
AND
SLAVERY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
OUTMODED

THE

THOSE
THAT
INSISTED
ON

WOULD
NOT
HAVE
CAUSED
THE
PASSAGE
OF
LAWS
TO
KEEP
OUT

SLAVE

WERE

TO
DO
ALMOST
ANYTHING
ELSE
