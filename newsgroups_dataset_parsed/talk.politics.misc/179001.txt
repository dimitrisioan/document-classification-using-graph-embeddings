QUESTION
ABOUT
REPRESENTATION
IN
A
DEBATE
ABOUT
THE
STUDENT
GOVERNMENT
HERE
AT
OUR
UNIVERSITY
A
QUESTION
WAS
RAISED
BY
ONE
STUDENT
SENATOR
WHY
SHOULD
I
REPRESENT
PEOPLE
WHO
DIDNT
VOTE
AND
BY
IMPLICATION
THIS
RAISES
A
DIFFERENT
QUESTION
WHY
SHOULD
I
REPRESENT
PEOPLE
WHO
DIDNT
VOTE
FOR
ME
I
FEEL
THAT
THERE
ARE
MANY
GOOD
REASONS
THAT
ANYONE
ELECTED
TO
PUBLIC
OFFICE
IN
STUDENT
GOVERNMENT
OR
ANY
OTHER
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
STRIVE
TO
REPRESENT
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THEIR
CONSTITUENCY
CLASS
OF
OR
A
GEOGRAPHICAL
AREA
OR
WHATEVER
I
WOULD
LIKE
SOME
HELP
FROM
OTHERS
IN
PHRASING
A
REASONABLE
ARGUMENT
ON
THIS
TOPIC
