nonsense

homosexuals
have
been
lying
about
the
number
for
so
long
that
the
politicians
are
running
scared
of
them
of
course
homosexuals
lying
should
be
no
surprise
how
can
you
lie
about
something
that
no
one
knows
for
sure
i
am
the
first
to
state
that
the
figure
may
be
too
high
but
it
may
just
be
too
low
depending
on
what
you
are
talking
about
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
practicing
heterosexuals
that
are
actually
gay
these
people
chose
to
take
a
road
that
avoids
being
harassed
and
they
wanted
to
fitin
with
everyone
other
normal
person
but
lets
get
off
of
this
irrational
behavior
of
calling
everyone
a
liar
you
cannot
even
start
to
support
such
claims
also
the
corrupt
criminal
and
lying
nature
of
kinseys
work
which
provides
much
of
the
justification
for
homosexual
rights
in
the
modern
era
should
make
people
step
back
for
a
moment
and
question
the
rest
of
the
crap
that
they
have
been
forcefed
by
the
news
media
this
sure
sounds
definitive
how
do
you
label
kinseys
work
like
this
from
that
factually
based
and
scientific
journal
wsj
relations
between
people
to
be
by
mutual
consent
or
not
at
all
this
is
an
interesting
statement
do
you
realize
how
many
things
you
do
your
life
that
are
not
based
on
mutual
consent
and
that
it
may
be
required
on
occasion
that
all
parties
may
not
be
mutually
consenting
