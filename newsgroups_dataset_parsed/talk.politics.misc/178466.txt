ryan
c
scharfy
said
however
legalizing
it
and
just
sticking
some
drugs
in
gas
stations
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
ryan
c
scharfy
or
the
government
could
adopt
the
radical
and
probably
unamerican
idea
that
citizens
are
free
to
live
their
lives
as
they
wish
and
simply
decriminalize
cocaine
marijuana
heroin
lsd
etc
please
explain
why
the
idea
of
allowing
recreational
drugs
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
after
all
it
works
just
fine
for
nicotine
wdstarr
yeah
cancer
is
pretty
cool
isnt
it
ryan
please
explain
how
the
coolness
or
lack
thereof
of
cancer
is
relevant
to
a
discussion
of
the
legalization
of
currently
illegal
recreational
drugs
for
that
matter
please
explain
how
its
even
relevant
to
a
discussion
of
currently
legal
recreational
drugs
such
as
tobacco
wdstarr
you
said
it
worked
so
well
with
tobacco
i
was
being
fascisiousi
cant
spell
worth
a
damn
look
this
is
getting
ridiculous
first
i
think
tobacco
should
be
legal
anybody
who
cant
see
the
difference
between
tobacco
and
marijuana
has
got
to
be
high
