THE
STATE
OF
JUSTICE
DEMONDESIREWRIGHTEDU
NOT
A
BOOMER
WRITES
A
JUDGE
DENIED
GMS
NEW
TRIAL
MOTION
EVEN
THOUGH
GM
SAYS
IT
HAS
TWO
NEW
WITNESSES
THAT
SAID
THE
OCCUPANT
OF
THE
TRUCK
WAS
DEAD
FROM
THE
IMPACT
NOT
FROM
THE
FIRE
THOUGHTS
HOW
CAN
A
WITNESS
TELL
THAT
SOMEONE
IN
A
BURNING
TRUCK
IS
DEAD
RATHER
THAN
UNCONSCIOUS
ITS
KIND
OF
SCARY
WHEN
YOU
REALIZE
THAT
JUDGES
ARE
GOING
TO
START
DENYING
NEW
TRIALS
EVEN
WHEN
NEW
EVIDENCE
THAT
CONTRADICTS
THE
FACTS
THAT
LED
TO
THE
PREVIOUS
RULING
APPEAR
OR
HAS
THE
JUDGE
DECIDED
THAT
THE
NEW
WITNESSES
ARE
NOT
TO
BE
BELIEVED
SHOULDNT
THAT
BE
UP
TO
A
JURY
WHAT
KIND
OF
WITNESSES
IF
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
WITNESSES
WHO
WERE
AT
THE
ACCIDENT
OR
WERE
OTHERWISE
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
EG
PARAMEDICS
EMERGENCY
ROOM
DOCTORS
ETC
THEN
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
USED
AT
THE
FIRST
TRIAL
YOU
DONT
GET
A
NEW
TRIAL
BECAUSE
YOU
SCREWED
UP
AND
FORGOT
TO
CALL
ALL
OF
YOUR
WITNESSES
IF
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
NEW
EXPERT
WITNESSES
WHO
WILL
OFFER
NEW
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
DATA
NOTE
THAT
THE
LOSER
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
SUCH
WITNESSES
IF
THIS
WERE
GROUNDS
FOR
A
NEW
TRIAL
THEN
THE
LOSER
COULD
ALWAYS
GET
A
NEW
TRIAL
AND
KEEP
DOING
SO
UNTIL
THE
LOSER
BECOMES
A
WINNER
AND
THEN
THE
OTHER
SIDE
WOULD
COME
UP
WITH
NEW
EXPERT
WITNESSES
