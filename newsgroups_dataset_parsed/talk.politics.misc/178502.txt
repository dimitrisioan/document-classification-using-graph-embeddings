digest
of
foreign
media
reaction
from
april
compiled
by
the
united
states
information
agency
terrorism
and
world
insecurity
in
recent
editorials
iran
was
universally
recognized
as
te
source
of
the
double
threat
of
statesponsored
terrorism
and
islamic
extremism
but
beyond
this
fear
and
condemnation
journalists
found
little
common
ground
that
would
compel
both
north
and
south
and
arab
and
nonarab
nations
to
work
together
to
combat
the
global
threat
of
terrorism
for
example
egyptian
and
algerian
papers
were
in
the
forefront
in
charging
us
complicity
in
the
current
instability
in
the
middle
east
those
commentators
asserted
that
the
united
states
had
promoted
islamic
fundamentalism
during
the
afghanistan
war
and
had
further
added
to
regional
instability
by
alternately
encouraging
iraq
and
iran
the
cads
the
fact
that
this
is
precisely
what
the
us
was
up
to
of
course
is
not
mentioned
it
is
a
fact
that
regan
and
bush
sold
arms
to
iran
it
is
also
a
fact
that
they
supported
and
armed
iraq
still
this
is
state
dept
propaganda
so
none
too
surprizing
indias
papers
weighed
the
pros
and
cons
of
helping
the
west
to
identify
pakistans
role
in
promoting
terrorism
noting
on
the
one
hand
that
doing
so
could
bring
ruination
to
islamabads
kashmir
cause
but
on
the
other
could
also
bring
indias
security
apparatus
uncomfortably
close
to
the
cia
and
the
mossad
arab
papers
continued
to
portray
iraq
and
libya
as
being
unfairly
treated
by
the
un
while
israel
remains
unpunished
for
resolutions
which
it
has
violated
in
the
case
of
lybia
there
is
the
problem
that
the
us
only
decided
that
gadffii
ordered
the
bombing
after
it
needed
to
make
peace
with
damascus
during
the
gulf
war
one
day
the
us
is
certain
that
its
syria
the
next
lybia
for
a
strange
reason
the
us
will
not
provide
evidence
to
lybian
courts
for
extradition
proceedings
faced
with
similar
demands
the
usa
would
reject
them
as
would
any
other
country
concerning
northern
ireland
president
clintons
message
of
consolation
to
the
victims
of
the
warrington
bombing
was
seen
in
british
tabloids
as
signalling
a
tougher
stance
by
the
american
government
against
violence
by
the
ira
the
word
is
terrorism
the
problem
is
that
after
the
behaviour
of
george
bush
the
usa
has
an
image
abroad
as
doing
precisely
what
it
likes
and
is
in
its
own
interests
then
comming
out
with
a
dysney
scripted
sugary
justification
repeating
a
fitting
combination
of
the
words
freedom
dignity
democaracy
or
of
terrorism
dictatorship
etc
as
appropriate
the
usa
could
go
quite
far
to
mend
the
bridges
with
iran
the
people
there
are
rather
pissed
off
because
the
usa
first
supported
the
shah
who
they
loathed
and
then
supported
saddam
when
he
mounted
an
unprovoked
attack
hardly
surprizing
after
the
embassy
hostage
crisis
but
iran
is
meant
to
be
the
country
run
by
unreasonable
bigots
not
the
usa
so
if
there
is
to
be
movement
it
would
be
easier
for
the
usa
to
move
first
off
they
could
recognise
iraqus
responsibility
in
initiating
the
iraniraq
war
providing
technical
assistance
to
iran
to
get
its
oil
production
back
up
to
capacity
would
also
be
a
smart
move
at
the
moment
iran
is
above
its
opec
ceiling
if
they
had
extra
capacity
they
would
use
it
and
bring
down
the
oild
price
further
which
is
in
our
interests
the
iranian
clerics
would
have
an
interest
in
seeking
a
raprochment
simply
because
a
permanent
war
footing
is
debilitating
they
also
need
western
technology
