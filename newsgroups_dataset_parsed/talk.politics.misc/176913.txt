IF
SOMEONE
BEATS
UP
A
HOMOSEXUAL
HE
SHOULD
GET
CHARGED
FOR
ASSAULT
AND
BATTERY
WHY
MUST
WE
ADD
GAY
BASHING
TO
THE
LIST
ISNT
THIS
A
SORT
OF
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
OR
AM
I
JUST
BEING
A
FASCIST
AGAIN
TO
DETER
AN
EPIDEMIC
OF
GAY
BASHING
THAT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
DETERRED
BY
ASSAULT
LAWS
SO
WE
OUGHT
TO
MAKE
BEATING
UP
A
HOMOSEXUAL
MORE
ILLEGAL
THAN
BEATING
UP
A
STRAIGHT
AND
WHOS
ADVOCATING
THAT
HATE
CRIMES
LAWS
ARE
AIMED
AT
THE
MOTIVATIONS
OF
THE
ACTS
JUST
LIKE
PREMEDITATED
HOMICIDE
IS
TREATED
STRICTER
THAN
HEATOFPASSION
HOMICIDE
NO
IT
IS
NOT
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
A
SINGLE
ACT
MAY
LEAD
TO
MULTIPLE
CHARGES
AND
MULTIPLE
CRIMES
I
THINK
WHAT
YOU
MEANT
TO
SAY
HERE
WAS
WITH
THE
CURRENT
MUTATION
OF
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
UNDER
THE
CURRENT
POLICE
STATE
SOMEONE
MAY
BE
CHARGED
MULTIPLE
TIMES
FOR
ONE
ACT
IF
THE
VICTIM
IN
QUESTION
IS
OF
THE
RIGHT
SHADE
A
SINGLE
ACT
SHOULD
NEVER
MERIT
MORE
THAN
ON
CHARGE
SO
IF
I
SET
OFF
A
BOMB
IN
THE
WORLD
TRADE
CENTER
I
CAN
ONLY
BE
CHARGED
WITH
MORE
THAN
ONE
MURDER
AND
NOT
THE
OTHER
FIVE
DEATHS
AND
EXTENSIVE
PROPERTY
DAMAGE
AFTER
ALL
THE
BOMB
WAS
A
SINGLE
ACT
