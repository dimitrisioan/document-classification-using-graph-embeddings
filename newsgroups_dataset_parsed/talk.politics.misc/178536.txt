not
at
all
you
are
apparently
just
another
member
of
the
religious
left
not
at
all
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
religious
left
right
or
even
center
in
fact
i
dont
consider
myself
very
religious
at
all
this
will
probably
result
in
flames
now
in
fact
phil
you
should
leave
religion
out
of
it
it
just
clouds
the
issue
show
me
all
these
environmental
disasters
most
of
them
arent
and
the
natural
disasters
we
have
had
individually
far
outweigh
the
manmade
ones
how
typical
so
you
think
we
shouldnt
avoid
these
events
i
shall
refrain
from
the
word
disaster
since
it
seems
to
upset
you
so
much
when
we
can
in
case
you
didnt
realize
it
the
natural
disasters
oops
sorry
events
you
are
refering
to
we
have
no
control
over
manmade
ones
we
do
i
guess
you
missed
the
show
on
ch
earlier
this
week
about
the
disaster
oops
there
i
go
again
i
meant
to
say
event
on
the
exxon
valdez
just
a
natural
every
day
occurance
to
spread
oil
on
miles
of
beach
i
would
like
to
know
which
natural
event
hey
i
remembered
not
to
say
disaster
that
would
be
similar
to
this
most
of
your
socalled
disasters
love
canal
times
beach
tmi
arent
disasters
at
all
hmm
i
suppose
you
could
be
right
they
are
as
natural
as
a
tree
or
a
sunrise
not
so
look
if
you
want
to
worship
trees
or
owls
or
snails
or
whatever
fine
do
so
but
dont
try
to
push
the
scaredness
of
your
religious
off
onto
me
so
look
if
you
want
to
worship
a
oil
slick
or
toxic
waste
dump
or
live
in
a
house
that
has
a
cesspool
in
the
front
yard
fine
you
have
my
permission
to
do
so
yea
right
like
you
need
my
permission
it
just
wont
be
in
the
neighborhood
where
i
live
but
dont
try
to
push
your
shortsighted
tunnelvision
views
off
on
the
rest
of
us
russell
hockins
there
are
people
who
believe
that
there
is
innovative
interfaces
inc
no
such
thing
as
an
environmental
disaster
pretty
weird
aint
it
my
own
opinions
no
one
elses
packet
