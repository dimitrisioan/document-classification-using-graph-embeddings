secondly
any
canadian
who
has
worked
and
participates
in
the
insurance
its
a
negative
option
you
have
to
explicitly
decline
it
knows
that
the
premium
is
deducted
separately
yes
and
some
americans
actually
have
a
problem
with
having
more
of
their
money
taken
from
them
to
pay
for
others
health
care
but
note
again
the
canadian
and
german
health
insurance
is
voluntary
not
true
i
am
required
to
have
insurance
by
law
the
method
of
collection
effectively
makes
it
a
tax
could
it
be
because
youre

phill
and
living
in
germany
while
the

working
rules
are
more
liberal
than
what
we
have
in

fta
theres
probably
a
law
about
that
having
health
insurance
coverage
is
a
condition
of
my
being
down
here
for
example
you
have
mentioned
this
once
before
yet
both
the
ny
times
profile
on
the
german
sickness
funds
late
jan
and
pamphlets
that
my
girlfriend
gives
to
her
language
students
from
the
german
consulate
both
say
that
it
is
voluntary
okay
there
were
quotation
marks
and
that
only
of
the
population
is
covered
by
the
sickness
funds
analogous
to
our
provincial
health
insurances
but
not
divided
by
provincestate
another
guy
in
health
care
policy
says
that
the
turkish
guest
workers
arent
covered
hes
written
to
me
a
couple
of
times
hes
not
