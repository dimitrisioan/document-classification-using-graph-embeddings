homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in
child
molestation
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
you
havent
shown
any
disproportionate
involvement
the
janus
report
which
came
out
recently
gives
as
the
percentage
of
exclusively
or
predominantly
gay
men
i
thumbed
through
the
janus
report
in
a
bookstore
recently
looking
for
a
clue
about
their
methodology
they
were
very
unclear
about
it
but
as
far
as
i
could
tell
they
relied
on
their
professional
associates
in
the
psychotherapy
profession
to
provide
the
subjects
interviews
and
numbers
if
so
this
would
hardly
represent
an
average
crosssection
i
posted
to
usenet
at
the
time
asking
for
more
data
about
their
methodology
but
answer
came
there
none
i
must
have
been
out
of
my
mind
for
even
asking
for
factual
information
on
usenet
no
one
is
presumably
going
to
say
theyre
gay
if
theyre
not
but
some
no
doubt
are
going
to
hide
their
homosexuality
in
surveys
thus
the
is
a
lower
limit
this
is
the
problem
people
have
to
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
anonymity
of
a
study
before
they
can
counted
on
to
speak
freely
about
stuff
like
that
but
i
agree
that
if
someones
going
to
lie
it
will
be
in
the
direction
of
a
gay
person
claiming
to
be
straight
rather
than
the
other
way
around
i
still
say
that
weighing
all
the
evidence
gives
a
most
likely
percentage
between
and
i
dont
see
why
theres
any
more
evidence
for
this
figure
than
any
other
it
seems
totally
arbitrary
