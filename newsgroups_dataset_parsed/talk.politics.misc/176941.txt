WITH
RUSSIAN
PRESS
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
OFFICE
OF
THE
PRESS
SECRETARY
VANCOUVER
BRITISH
COLUMBIA
FOR
IMMEDIATE
RELEASE
APRIL
PRESS
CONFERENCE
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
WITH
RUSSIAN
PRESS
CANADA
PLACE
VANCOUVER
BRITISH
COLUMBIA
PM
PDT
Q
I
HAD
TWO
QUESTIONS
FOR
BOTH
PRESIDENTS
SO
YOU
COULD
PROBABLY
ANSWER
FOR
BORIS
TOO
LAUGHTER
THE
PRESIDENT
ILL
GIVE
YOU
MY
ANSWER
THEN
ILL
GIVE
YOU
YELTSINS
ANSWER
LAUGHTER
Q
THE
FIRST
IS
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
MEETING
OF
THE
PRESIDENTS
SO
THE
MONEY
THATS
BEING
PROMISED
IS
GOVERNMENT
MONEY
AND
NATURALLY
ITS
GOING
TO
BE
DISTRIBUTED
THROUGH
THE
GOVERNMENT
BUT
YOUVE
INDICATED
THAT
THREEQUARTERS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
GOING
TO
BUSINESSES
SO
THE
QUESTION
IS
HOW
THE
RUSSIAN
BUSINESSES
THEMSELVES
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
CONSULTED
IF
EVER
WHAT
ARE
THE
PRIORITIES
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
ASSOCIATION
OF
RUSSIAN
BUSINESSMEN
EXISTING
ALREADY
SO
WILL
THEY
BE
INVITED
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
SETTING
UP
PRIORITIES
FOR
INVESTMENT
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
AND
SECOND
TO
YOU
WE
KNOW
THAT
POLLS
PUBLIC
POLLS
IN
AMERICA
DO
NOT
SHOW
THAT
AMERICANS
ARE
VERY
ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT
GIVING
THIS
AID
LIKE
NEWSWEEK
POLLS
SAY
THAT
ABOUT
PERCENT
DONT
APPROVE
IT
AND
NEW
YORK
TIMES
PUBLISHED
THAT
PERCENT
SUPPORT
IF
IT
JUST
PREVENTS
CIVIL
WAR
PERCENT
IF
IT
FOSTERS
DEMOCRATIC
REFORM
AND
ONLY
PERCENT
IF
IT
JUST
PERSONALLY
SUPPORTS
YELTSIN
HOW
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
SORT
OF
HANDLE
THIS
PROBLEM
THAT
AMERICANS
THEMSELVES
ARE
NOT
VERY
ENTHUSIASTIC
THANK
YOU
Q
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
IM
SORRY
IS
THERE
GOING
TO
BE
A
TRANSLATION
OF
EVERYTHING
INTO
RUSSIAN
NO
JUST
THE
ANSWERS
JUST
THE
ANSWERS
OKAY
THE
PRESIDENT
THE
ANSWER
TO
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
IS
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
KIND
OF
AID
WERE
DISCUSSING
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
FUNDS
THAT
WILL
BE
SET
UP
FOR
FINANCING
NEW
BUSINESSES
WILL
OBVIOUSLY
GO
TO
THOSE
BUSINESSES
WHO
APPLY
AND
WHO
SEEM
TO
BE
GOOD
RISKS
AND
MAKE
THE
APPLICATION
THE
PRIVATIZATION
FUND
WILL
BE
USED
TO
SUPPORT
THE
PRIVATIZATION
OF
EXISTING
PUBLIC
ENTERPRISES
THEN
THERE
ARE
SOME
OTHER
GENERAL
FUNDS
IN
THE
DEMOCRACY
CORPS
AND
OTHER
THINGS
WHICH
PEOPLE
IN
RUSSIA
WILL
HAVE
SOME
INFLUENCE
OVER
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
WITH
REGARD
TO
YOUR
SECOND
QUESTION
LET
ME
SAY
THAT
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
PEOPLE
IN
BOTH
COUNTRIES
WHO
WOULD
NOT
FEEL
TOO
WARMLY
TOWARD
SIMPLY
THE
AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT
GIVING
MONEY
TO
THE
RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT
THERES
OPPOSITION
TO
THAT
IN
RUSSIA
AND
IN
OUR
COUNTRY
THROUGHOUT
OUR
WHOLE
HISTORY
THERE
HAS
BEEN
AN
OPPOSITION
TO
FOREIGN
AID
OF
ALL
KINDS
THAT
IS
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
RUSSIA
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
WHOLE
HISTORY
OF
AMERICA
ANY
KIND
OF
AID
PROGRAM
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
UNPOPULAR
WHAT
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
TELL
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
IS
IS
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
AID
PROGRAM
THIS
IS
AN
INVESTMENT
PROGRAM
THAT
THIS
IS
AN
INVESTMENT
IN
OUR
FUTURE
WE
SPENT
TRILLION
TRILLION
ON
ARMAMENTS
ON
SOLDIERS
AND
OTHER
INVESTMENTS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
COLD
WAR
NOW
WITH
A
DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT
IN
RUSSIA
WITH
THE
NEWLY
INDEPENDENT
STATES
THE
REMAINDER
OF
THEM
WORKING
ON
A
DEMOCRACY
AND
STRUGGLING
TO
GET
THEIR
ECONOMIES
GOING
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
VERY
MUCH
IN
OUR
INTEREST
TO
MAKE
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
WHATEVER
WE
CAN
FOR
DEMOCRACY
TO
SURVIVE
FOR
THE
ECONOMY
OF
RUSSIA
TO
GROW
BECAUSE
OF
THE
POTENTIAL
FOR
TRADE
AND
INVESTMENT
THERE
AND
FOR
US
TO
CONTINUE
THE
EFFORT
TO
REDUCE
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
AND
OTHER
ELEMENTS
OF
HOSTILITY
ON
BOTH
SIDES
ON
OUR
SIDE
AND
ON
THE
RUSSIAN
SIDE
SO
I
DONT
SEE
THIS
AS
AN
AID
PROGRAM
THIS
IS
AN
INVESTMENT
FOR
THE
UNITED
STATES
THIS
IS
VERY
MUCH
IN
THE
INTEREST
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
THE
THINGS
I
ANNOUNCED
TODAY
THE
SECOND
STAGE
OF
THE
PROGRAM
WHICH
I
HOPE
TO
PUT
TOGETHER
NEXT
WEEK
IN
MY
VIEW
ARE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
GOOD
FOR
MY
COUNTRY
AND
FOR
THE
TAXPAYERS
AND
WORKERS
OF
MY
COUNTRY
RUSSIA
IS
A
VERY
GREAT
NATION
THAT
NEEDS
SOME
PARTNERSHIP
NOW
SOME
COMMON
ENDEAVOR
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHO
SHARE
HER
GOALS
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GREAT
MISTAKE
FOR
ANYONE
TO
VIEW
THIS
AS
SOME
SORT
OF
JUST
A
CHARITY
OR
AN
AID
ISSUE
THATS
NOT
WHAT
IT
IS
ITS
AN
INVESTMENT
FOR
AMERICA
AND
ITS
A
WONDERFUL
INVESTMENT
LIKE
ALL
INVESTMENTS
THERE
IS
SOME
RISK
BUT
THERES
FAR
LESS
RISK
WITH
A
FAR
GREATER
POTENTIAL
OF
RETURN
THAN
THE
TRILLION
WE
SPENT
LOOKING
AT
EACH
OTHER
ACROSS
THE
BARRIER
OF
THE
COLD
WAR
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
FIRST
OF
ALL
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
INDEED
FOR
COMING
HERE
AND
TALKING
TO
US
IN
THE
MEMORY
OF
THE
LIVING
CORRESPONDENTS
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
TIME
AN
AMERICAN
PRESIDENT
IS
DOING
THIS
TO
THE
RUSSIAN
PRESS
CORPS
SO
ITS
KIND
OF
A
VERY
MEASURED
BREAKTHROUGH
I
HAVE
TWO
QUESTIONS
ONE
IN
YOUR
INTRODUCTORY
REMARKS
OF
THE
OTHER
PRESS
CONFERENCE
YOU
MENTIONED
IN
BRIEF
THAT
YOU
DISCUSSED
THE
START
II
AND
START
I
ISSUES
COULD
YOU
TELL
US
DID
YOU
REACH
AN
AGREEMENT
WITH
PRESIDENT
YELTSIN
AS
TO
WHAT
MIGHT
BE
DONE
IN
ORDER
TO
HAVE
UKRAINE
JOIN
THE
RATIFICATION
OF
START
I
AND
THE
NPT
REGIME
AND
MY
SECOND
QUESTION
IS
HOW
CONFIDENT
YOU
ARE
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
CONGRESS
WOULD
BE
EAGER
TO
SUPPORT
YOU
IN
LIFTING
JACKSONVANIK
AND
OTHER
RESTRICTIONS
INHERITED
FROM
THE
COLD
WAR
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
FIRST
WE
DISCUSSED
THE
ISSUE
OF
UKRAINE
WITH
REGARD
TO
START
I
AND
NPT
AND
GENERALLY
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
NEED
TO
PROCEED
TO
HAVE
THE
OTHER
INDEPENDENT
STATES
ALL
BE
NONNUCLEAR
BUT
ALSO
TO
HAVE
THE
UNITED
STATES
DEVELOP
STRONG
RELATIONSHIPS
WITH
THEM
WE
KNOW
THAT
ONE
THING
THAT
WE
COULD
DO
THAT
WOULD
INCREASE
I
THINK
THE
WILLINGNESS
OF
THE
UKRAINE
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
DIRECTION
IS
TO
SUCCESSFULLY
CONCLUDE
OUR
OWN
NEGOTIATIONS
ON
HIGHLY
ENRICHED
URANIUM
BECAUSE
THAT
WOULD
PROVIDE
NOT
ONLY
AN
IMPORTANT
ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
RUSSIA
BUT
ALSO
FOR
UKRAINE
AND
IT
WOULD
SHOW
SOME
REACHING
OUT
ON
OUR
PART
BUT
WE
AGREED
THAT
BASICALLY
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
SIGNED
OFF
ON
THE
LISBON
PROTOCOL
HAVE
GOT
TO
HONOR
WHAT
THEY
DID
AND
WE
AGREED
TO
CONTINUE
TO
PRESS
THAT
I
MYSELF
HAVE
SPENT
A
GOOD
DEAL
OF
TIME
TRYING
TO
REASSURE
UKRAINES
LEADERS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
PRESIDENT
AND
THE
FOREIGN
MINISTER
THAT
I
WANT
STRONG
TIES
WITH
UKRAINE
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
VERY
MUCH
WANTS
A
GOOD
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
UKRAINE
BUT
THAT
IN
ORDER
TO
DO
WHAT
WE
NEED
TO
DO
TOGETHER
TO
STRENGTHEN
THE
ECONOMY
OF
UKRAINE
AND
TO
HAVE
THE
UNITED
STATES
BE
FULLY
SUPPORTIVE
THE
COMMITMENT
TO
RATIFY
START
I
AND
TO
JOIN
THE
NPT
REGIME
IS
CRITICAL
WHAT
WAS
THE
SECOND
QUESTION
THE
PRESIDENT
WITH
REGARD
TO
JACKSONVANIK
AND
COCOM
I
WOULD
MAKE
TWO
POINTS
FIRST
I
HAVE
AGREED
WITH
THE
REPUBLICAN
AND
DEMOCRATIC
LEADERS
IN
THE
CONGRESS
THAT
WE
WILL
AS
SOON
AS
I
RETURN
HAVE
A
LIST
OF
ALL
THE
LEGISLATIVE
AND
OTHER
RESTRICTIONS
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
REGULATORY
IN
NATURE
IMPOSED
ON
RELATIONS
BETWEEN
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
RUSSIA
THAT
ARE
LEGACIES
OF
THE
COLD
WAR
AND
WE
WILL
SEE
WHETHER
THEYRE
HOW
MANY
OF
THEM
WE
COULD
AGREE
TO
DO
AWAY
WITH
RIGHT
NOW
AT
LEAST
AMONG
THE
LEADERSHIP
OF
THE
CONGRESS
WITH
REGARD
TO
JACKSONVANIK
I
THINK
THERE
WILL
BE
AN
OPENNESS
TO
CHANGE
THE
LAW
IF
THE
CONGRESS
IS
CONVINCED
THERE
ARE
IN
FACT
NO
MORE
REFUSNIKS
NO
MORE
PEOPLE
WHO
WISH
TO
EMIGRATE
WHO
ARE
NOT
BEING
ALLOWED
TO
IF
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
ONE
THERE
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
WHO
THE
LAW
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
AFFECT
THEN
I
THINK
THAT
THE
DESIRE
TO
KEEP
THE
LAW
WILL
BE
MUCH
LESS
WITH
REGARD
TO
COCOM
MY
GUESS
IS
AND
ITS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
GUESS
THAT
THE
LEADERSHIP
OF
CONGRESS
AND
INDEED
MY
OWN
ADVISERS
MIGHT
PREFER
TO
SEE
SOME
SORT
OF
PHASED
MOVEMENT
OUT
OF
THE
COCOM
REGIME
BUT
I
THINK
THEY
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
BEGIN
IT
IN
THE
FAIRLY
NEAR
FUTURE
Q
MR
CLINTON
WHEN
I
READ
YOUR
SPEECH
IN
ANNAPOLIS
I
GOT
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
PERSONAL
AND
I
STRESS
THAT
PERSONAL
NOT
POLITICAL
APPROACH
TOWARDS
RUSSIA
COMPARED
TO
THE
APPROACH
OF
MR
BUSH
COULD
YOU
FORMULATE
IN
A
FEW
WORDS
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
YOU
AS
A
PERSONALITY
AND
YOUR
APPROACH
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
YOUR
APPROACH
TO
RUSSIA
AND
THE
APPROACH
OF
MR
BUSH
AND
WHO
MADE
YOU
WHY
DID
YOU
CITE
AKHMATOVA
IN
THE
LAST
PART
OF
YOUR
SPEECH
THE
PRESIDENT
LET
ME
SAY
FIRST
I
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
COMPARE
MYSELF
WITH
PRESIDENT
BUSH
OR
ANYONE
ELSE
I
CANT
SAY
WHAT
WAS
IN
HIS
HEART
ABOUT
RUSSIA
I
CAN
SAY
THAT
SINCE
I
WAS
A
BOY
I
HAVE
BEEN
PERSONALLY
FASCINATED
WITH
THE
HISTORY
THE
MUSIC
AND
THE
CULTURE
AND
THE
LITERATURE
OF
RUSSIA
I
HAVE
BEEN
THRILLED
BY
RUSSIAN
MUSIC
SINCE
I
WAS
A
SERIOUS
STUDENT
OF
MUSIC
FOR
MORE
THAN
YEARS
NOW
I
HAVE
READ
MAJOR
RUSSIAN
NOVELISTS
AND
MANY
OF
YOUR
POETS
AND
FOLLOWED
YOUR
BALLET
AND
TRIED
TO
KNOW
AS
MUCH
AS
I
COULD
ABOUT
YOUR
HISTORY
AND
I
WENT
TO
THE
SOVIET
UNION
BUT
IT
WAS
THEN
THE
SOVIET
UNION
YOU
MAY
KNOW
IT
WAS
A
BIG
ISSUE
IN
THE
LAST
PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN
THAT
I
SPENT
THE
FIRST
WEEK
OF
ALONE
IN
MOSCOW
AND
DID
NOT
RETURN
AGAIN
UNTIL
THREE
DAYS
BEFORE
MR
YELTSIN
WAS
ELECTED
PRESIDENT
BUT
ALL
THAT
TIME
I
WAS
AWAY
I
WAS
FOLLOWING
EVENTS
THERE
VERY
CLOSELY
AND
HOPING
FOR
THE
DAY
WHEN
WE
COULD
BE
GENUINE
PARTNERS
SO
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
HAD
A
PERSONAL
FEELING
ABOUT
RUSSIA
I
REMEMBER
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
LOT
OF
YOU
KNOW
I
LIKE
MUSIC
VERY
MUCH
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
MOVING
EXPERIENCES
FOR
ME
AS
A
MUSICIAN
WAS
WHEN
LEONARD
BERNSTEIN
TOOK
THE
NEW
YORK
PHILHARMONIC
TO
MOSCOW
AND
PLAYED
SHOSTAKOVICHS
FIFTH
SYMPHONY
TO
THE
RUSSIANS
AND
HE
PLAYED
THE
LAST
MOVEMENT
MORE
RAPIDLY
THAN
ANYONE
HAD
EVER
PLAYED
IT
BEFORE
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
TECHNICALLY
SO
DIFFICULT
THAT
IS
SOMETHING
I
FOLLOWED
VERY
CLOSELY
WHEN
IT
OCCURRED
THESE
ARE
THINGS
THAT
HAVE
ALWAYS
HAD
A
BIG
IMPACT
ON
MY
LIFE
AND
I
HAD
JUST
ALWAYS
HOPED
THAT
SOMEDAY
IF
I
EVER
HAD
THE
CHANCE
TO
I
COULD
PLAY
A
ROLE
IN
SEEING
OUR
TWO
COUNTRIES
BECOME
CLOSER
PARTNERS
APPLAUSE
THE
PRESS
THANK
YOU
