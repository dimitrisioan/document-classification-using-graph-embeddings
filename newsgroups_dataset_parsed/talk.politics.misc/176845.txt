JUST
SUCH
A
PLACE
ALTHOUGH
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
ESCAPED
MY
UNDERSTANDING
JUST
WHAT

ALLEGEDLY
RATIONAL

OF
SUCH
A
SCHEME
MIGHT
BE
WHAT
GIVES
KING
OLAV

OR
WHOEVER
IT

SOME
OF
OUR

DONE
NOTHING
PETER

WHICH
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
SOME
OF
OUR
PRESIDENTS
HAVE
NOT
PROVIDED
A
SERVICE
FOR
THE
COUNTRY
TOO
DISSIMILAR
FROM
WHAT
