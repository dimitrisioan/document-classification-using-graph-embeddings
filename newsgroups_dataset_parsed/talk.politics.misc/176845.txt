where
you
appear
to
be
posting
from
is
just
such
a
place
although
it
has
always
escaped
my
understanding
just
what
the
appeal
to
allegedly
rational
people
of
such
a
scheme
might
be
what
gives
king
olav
v
or
whoever
it
is
now
my
atlas
is
from
the
right
to
any
special
legal
status
or
title
based
on
a
mere
accident
of
birth
to
begin
with
its
quite
inexpensive
compared
to
here
what
with
our
having
six
former
presidents
still
alive
drawing
pensions
expense
accounts
and
secret
service
protection
maybe
so
but
they
were
after
all
president
in
the
corporate
world
its
sop
for
retiring
senior
executives
to
be
given
nice
pensions
etc
the
point
is
that
they
performed
a
service
and
this
is
part
of
the
compensation
package
the
only
service
royals
have
to
perform
for
their
free
ride
is
being
born
we
might
be
better
off
had
some
of
our
former
presidents
done
nothing
peter
ps
which
is
not
to
say
that
some
of
our
presidents
have
not
provided
a
service
for
the
country
too
dissimilar
from
what
occurs
when
a
bull
services
a
cow
for
those
of
you
familiar
with
cattle
breeding
