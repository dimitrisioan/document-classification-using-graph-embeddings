re
tieing
abortion

is

nuts

article
writes
i
like
the
way
people
call
it
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
as
if
imprisonment
isnt
cruel
too
lethal
injection
pales
in
comparison
and
they
have
a
death
sentence
because
they
were
convicted
of
a
cruel
and
unusual
crime
its
not
what
they
did
that
matters
its
what
you
do
and
what
i
do
and
what
we
do
in
response
that
matters
do
we
lessen
ourselves
by
killing
in
response
to
killing
its
vengeance
thats
all
its
no
deterrent
it
serves
no
purpose
but
to
slake
somebodys
blood
lust
it
would
be
nice
though
if
we
never
convicted
someone
of
a
crime
they
didnt
commit
and
it
would
make
the
death
penalty
much
more
justifiable
yeah
yeah
yeah
and
sure
would
be
nice
if
we
didnt
apply
the
death
penalty
disproportionately
to
minorities
ill
revisit
my
opinion
on
the
death
penalty
when
there
are
more
whites
up
for
it
than
blacks
ie
when
hell
