RNITEDACE
AND
VIOLENCE
IN

NEAL
SAID
MY
VIEWS
ARE
OUT
OF
EXPERIENCES
WHEN
I
WAS
A
POLICE
OFFICER
IN
A
LARGE
METROPOLITAN
AREA
AND
OF
A
CITIZEN
UNLESS
PEOPLE
ACCOUNT
FOR
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
AND
FOR
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THEIR
IMMEDIATE
COMMUNITY
NOTHING
WILL
IMPROVE
WAIT
A
MINUTE
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THEIR
OWN
BEHAVIOR
I
ASSUME
THATS
WHAT
YOU
MEANT
BY
THE
WORD
ACCOUNT
BUT
ALSO
FOR
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THEIR
IMMEDIATE
COMMUNITY
FIRST
OF
ALL
HOW
IMMEDIATE
ARE
YOU
TALKING
ABOUT
AND
SECONDLY
I
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
TROUBLE
WITH
ANY
THEORY
OF
SOCIAL
BEHAVIOR
OR
JUSTICE
WHICH
CHARGES
ANYONE
WITH
THE
DUTY
OF
TAKING
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
OR
ACCOUNTING
FOR
THE
ACTIONS
OF
A
DIFFERENT
PERSON
