WRITES
JANET
RENO
KILLED
THE
WACO
CHILDREN
SHE
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
DEATHS
SHE
SHOULD
RESIGN
IMMEDIATELY
SHE
SHOULD
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
A
MADMAN
WHO
WOULD
DO
ANYTHING
AGAINST
THE
CHILDREN
IF
HE
BECAME
PROVOKED
ALL
THE
WARNING
SIGNS
WERE
THERE
AND
SHE
IGNORED
THEM
SHE
PROVOKED
KORESH
INTO
KILLING
THE
CHILDREN
ASIDE
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
I
DISAGREE
W
YOU
SHE
DID
OFFER
TO
RESIGN
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
REJECTED
THE
OFFER
SHE
WAS
WILLING
TO
TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
THE
PRESIDENT
HAS
THE
BALLS
ENOUGH
TO
STAND
BY
A
DECISION
THE
FACT
THAT
RENO
IS
ACTUALLY
TAKING
RESPONSIBILITY
GEETHATS
A
NEW
ONE
FOR
A
POLITICIAN
IS
A
NEW
THING
FOR
A
MEMBER
OF
CLINTONS
ADMINISTRATION
I
ACTUALLY
RESPECT
HER
FOR
HAVING
A
BACKBONE
I
NEVER
THOUGHT
ID
SAY
THAT
ABOUT
SOMEONE
FROM
THAT
BUNCH
THE
WAY
I
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
HAPPENED
IS
THAT
SHE
DISCUSSED
WITH
CLINTON
WHAT
WAS
BEING
PLANNED
FOR
WACO
CLINTON
DIDNT
SAY
NO
SO
GAVE
DE
FACTO
APPROVAL
FOR
THE
OPERATION
THINGS
GOT
MESSED
UP
AND
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
DIED
HORRIBLE
DEATHS
IF
I
AM
INCORRECT
ABOUT
THIS
PLEASE
FEEL
FREE
TO
CORRECT
IT
THIS
IS
JUST
WHAT
IVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
PICK
UP
IVE
JUST
GOT
A
COUPLE
OF
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THIS
WHOLE
THING
WHY
DID
THE
GOVERNMENT
FEEL
THEY
NEEDED
TO
ASSAULT
THAT
COMPOUND
WHY
DIDNT
THEY
TRY
TO
FLUSH
THEM
OUT
IN
THE
FIRST
WEEK
OF
THIS
FIASCO
INSTEAD
OF
WAITING
DAYS
JANET
RENO
JUMPED
UP
TO
TAKE
RESPONSIBILTY
TO
TAKE
HEAT
AWAY
FROM
THE
PRESIDENT
DOES
THIS
SOUND
ANYTHING
LIKE
WHAT
A
COUPLE
OF
REAGANS
AIDES
DID
AARON
