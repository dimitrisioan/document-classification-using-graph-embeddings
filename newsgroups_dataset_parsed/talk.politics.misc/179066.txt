WRITES
THIRDLY
IT
SEEMS
INCREDIBLY
HYPOCRITICAL
TO
PLACE
BLAME
GIVEN
THE
BENEFIT
OF
HINDSIGHT
SOMETHING
THAT
THOSE
WHO
MADE
THE
DECISIONS
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
BENEFIT
OF
WHY
NOT
GIVE
THEM
THE
COURTESY
OF
ACKNOWLEDGING
THAT
THEY
DID
THE
BEST
THEY
COULD
WITH
THE
DATA
THEY
HAD
IN
A
VERY
VERY
DIFFICULT
SITUATION
WHAT
IS
YOUR
PROOF
THAT
THEY
DID
THE
BEST
THEY
COULD
UNLESS
THEY
HAD
STRONG
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
WERE
IN
IMMEDIATE
DANGER
THEN
THE
BEST
THEY
COULD
HAVE
DONE
WAS
TO
SHOW
RESTRAINT
SOME
OF
US
DID
PREDICT
THIS
OUTCOME
OR
AT
LEAST
SUGGESTED
A
STRONG
POSSIBILITY
OF
IT
I
FOR
ONE
SAID
THAT
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
AN
ASSAULT
AGAINST
THE
BUILDING
THE
CHILDREN
WERE
THE
ONES
IN
DANGER
EITHER
FROM
THE
ASSAULT
ITSELF
OR
FROM
A
JONESTOWN
MY
PHRASE
A
WEEK
AFTER
THE
SEIGE
STARTED
STYLE
SUICIDE
AND
AS
I
POINTED
OUT
THEN
AND
REPEATEDLY
OVER
THE
OBJECTIONS
OF
PEOPLE
ON
THE
NET
WHO
DISAGREED
WITH
ME
AN
ADULT
MAY
FREELY
CHOOSE
SUICIDE
BUT
THEY
HAVE
NO
RIGHT
TO
IMPOSE
THIS
CHOICE
ON
THEIR
CHILDREN
NOW
WHILE
I
DONT
EXPECT
THE
FBI
TO
PAY
ANY
ATTENTION
TO
WHAT
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
ON
THIS
I
DO
EXPECT
THEM
TO
FIGURE
IT
OUT
ON
THEIR
OWN
OR
TO
TAKE
THE
ADVICE
OF
EXPERTS
THE
CULT
SPECIALIST
INTER
VIEWED
IN
YESTERDAYS
BOSTON
GLOBE
SAID
HE
WAS
REPEATEDLY
STONEWALLED
BY
THE
FBI
WHEN
HE
POINTED
OUT
TO
THEM
THAT
THEIR
CONFRONTATIONAL
TACTICS
PLAYED
PERFECTLY
INTO
KORESHS
MAD
VIEW
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
SO
INCREASED
THE
CHANCE
OF
A
TRAGIC
OUTCOME
SOME
RESPONSES
HAVE
GONE
SO
FAR
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
ACTIONS
WERE
DONE
WITHOUT
REGARD
FOR
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
GIVE
US
A
BREAK
PUMPING
TEARGAS
FOR
MINUTES
INTO
A
COMPOUND
FILLED
WITH
CHILDREN
THIS
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
SHOW
MUCH
REGARD
FOR
THEIR
LIVES
OR
SAFETY
NONTOXIC
TEARGAS
IS
AN
OXYMORON
CHILDREN
HAVE
TINY
RESPIRATORY
PASSAGES
WHICH
ARE
EASILY
BLOCKED
BY
THE
SECRETIONS
INDUCED
BY
TEARGAS
MOREOVER
TEARGAS
CAN
EASILY
CAUSE
FATALITIES
IN
ANYONE
SUBJECT
TO
LARYNGOSPASMS
ASTHMA
OR
HEART
DISEASE
IF
A
MADMAN
IS
HOLDING
A
GUN
TO
A
HOSTAGE
SOMEONE
WHO
PROVOKES
THE
MADMAN
BY
ATTACKING
HIM
BEARS
NEARLY
AS
MUCH
REPSONSIBILITY
FOR
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
HOSTAGE
AS
THE
MADMAN
HIMSELF
THESE
KINDS
OF
SITUATIONS
HAVE
TO
BE
HANDLED
DELICATELY
NOT
BY
SURROUNDING
A
PLACE
WITH
TANKS
AND
HEAVILY
ARMED
PERSONNEL
AND
BLARING
ROCK
MUSIC
FROM
LOUD
SPEAKERS
AT
ALL
HOURS
THAT
APPROACH
IS
IDIOTIC
BE
PART
OF
THE
SOLUTION
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
THE
SOLUTION
IS
TO
GREATLY
REDUCE
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
THE
AUTHORITIES
THE
FEDS
SHOWED
THEMSELVES
HERE
AS
THEY
HAVE
SO
MANY
TIMES
IN
THE
PAST
TO
BE
A
GANG
OF
TRIGGERHAPPY
IMPULSIVE
YAHOOS
WHO
CAUSE
MORE
TROUBLE
THAN
THEY
PREVENT
THEIR
CONFRONTATIONAL
APPROACH
REINFORCED
EVERY
SINGLE

KORESH
WAS
GIVING
HIS
FOLLOWERS
VIRTUALLY
GUARANTEE
ING
THAT
WHATEVER
CRAZY
SOLUTION
KORESH
PROPOSED
WOULD
BE
FOLLOWED
WILLINGLY
THIS
WAS
POINTED
OUT
HERE
ON
COMPUSERVE
IN
THE

JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
PLACE

IN

IT
