RE
THE
STATE
OF
JUSTICE
IN
DEMONDESIREWRIGHTEDU
SEZ
A
JUDGE
DENIED
GMS
NEW
TRIAL
MOTION
EVEN
THOUGH
GM
SAYS
IT
HAS
TWO
NEW
WITNESSES
THAT
SAID
THE
OCCUPANT
OF
THE
TRUCK
WAS
DEAD
FROM
THE
IMPACT
NOT
FROM
THE
FIRE
THOUGHTS
ITS
KIND
OF
SCARY
WHEN
YOU
REALIZE
THAT
JUDGES
ARE
GOING
TO
START
DENYING
NEW
TRIALS
EVEN
WHEN
NEW
EVIDENCE
THAT
CONTRADICTS
THE
FACTS
THAT
LED
TO
THE
PREVIOUS
RULING
APPEAR
THERES
THIS
MINOR
THING
CALLED
INTEREST
OF
FINALITYREPOSE
WHAT
IT
MEANS
IS
THAT
PARTIES
ARENT
DRAGGED
INTO
COURT
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
BECAUSE
THE
LOSING
SIDE
DISCOVERS
SOME
NEW
EVIDENCE
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
YOU
BRETT
BUT
I
SUSPECT
GM
HAD
THE
RESOURCES
TO
FIND
JUST
ABOUT
AS
MANY
EXPERT
AND
FACT
WITNESSES
AS
IT
WANTED
BEFORE
THE
TRIAL
STARTED
LETTING
THEM
REOPEN
THE
CASE
NOW
IS
PRACTICALLY
AN
INVITATION
TO
EVERY
CIVIL
LITIGANT
ON
EARTH
TO
KEEP
AN
ACE
IN
THE
HOLE
IN
CASE
THE
VERDICT
GOES
AGAINST
HIM
BTW
IN
FEDERAL
CRIMINAL
CASES
RULE
DOES
PERMIT
A
MOTION
FOR
A
NEW
TRIAL
BASED
ON
NEWLY
DISCOVERED
EVIDENCE
IF
MADE
WITHIN
YEARS
OF
THE
VERDICT
EMPHASIS
MINE
IF
YOURE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
A
BACKHANDED
POINT
ABOUT
CRIMINAL
JUSTICE
IN
A
DISCUSSION
THAT
HAS
LITTLE
TO
DO
WITH
CRIMINAL
TRIALS
AS
THE
ESTIMABLE
DAVID
BROCK
DID
IN
HIS
AMUSING
WSJ
PIECE
LAST
WEEK
SAVE
YOUR
BREATH
OR
HAS
THE
JUDGE
DECIDED
THAT
THE
NEW
WITNESSES
ARE
NOT
TO
BE
BELIEVED
SHOULDNT
THAT
BE
UP
TO
A
JURY
YUP
WHICH
IS
WHY
THEY
SHOULDA
BEEN
BROUGHT
AROUND
THE
FIRST
TIME
THROUGH
AND
WHAT
ABOUT
MEMBERS
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
JURY
PARADING
THROUGH
THE
TALK
SHOWS
PROCLAIMING
THEIR
OBVIOUS
BIAS
AGAINST
GM
SHOULDNT
THAT
BE
ENOUGH
FOR
A
JUDGE
TO
THROUGH
OUT
THE
OLD
VERDICT
AND
CALL
FOR
A
NEW
TRIAL
WHATEVER
HAPPENED
TO
JURORS
HAVING
TO
BE
OBJECTIVE
UNLESS
THERES
SOME
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
SUPPOSED
BIAS
PREDATED
THE
TRIAL
AS
OPPOSED
TO
BEING
A
PRODUCT
OF
IT
AND
THAT
GM
WAS
UNFAIRLY
PREVENTED
FROM
DISCOVERING
IT
BY
VENIREMAN
CONCEALMENT
OR
OTHERWISE
WHY
SHOULD
GM
BE
ALLOWED
TO
COMPLAIN
MORAL
ALWAYS
CHOOSE
THE
RIGHT
SORT
OF
PARENTS
BEFORE
YOU
START
IN
TO
BE
ROUGH
