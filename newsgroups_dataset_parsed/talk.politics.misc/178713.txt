release

clipper
chip
encryption
initiative
in
article
the
white
house
writes
statement
by
the
press
secretary
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
while
also
allowing
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
phone
conversations
of
criminals
and
noncriminals
unlawfully
no

we
arent
spying
on
you
i
wonder
how
long
it
will
take
for
the
wrong
people
to
put
their
hands
on
the
equipment
necessary
to
read
this
stuff
itll
probably
be
as
safe
as
weapons
locked
safely
in
evidence
rooms
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
and
people
to
whom
they
sell
them
to
all
it
takes
is
corrupting
the
right
guy
no
that
never
happens
