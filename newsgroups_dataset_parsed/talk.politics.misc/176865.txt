THANKS
TO
KIM
FOR
FOLLOWING
UP
I
WAS
HOPING
THAT
SOMEONE
WOULD
BRING
UP
THE
ISSUE
OF
COST
COMPENSATION
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
IT
FAILS
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
KIDNEY
DIALYSIS
RD
SERVICES
HAVE
EXPANDED
MASSIVELY
IN
THE
LAST
DECADE
AFTER
ALL
NO
ONE
IS
FORCING
PRIVATE
PROVIDERS
TO
OFFER
THIS
SERVICE
IF
THEY
ARE
LOSING
MONEY
ON
THE
TREATMENT
WHICH
ACCORDING
TO
INFORMATION
IVE
COLLECTED
FROM
SEVERAL
PROVIDERS
THEY
ARE
NOT
WHY
WOULD
THEY
NOT
SIMPLY
LIMIT
THEIR
LOSSES
BY
CUTTING
BACK
ON
SERVICES
ENGAGE
IN
EFFECTIVE
RATIONING
OF
SUPPLY
RATHER
THAN
EXPAND
THE
COVERAGE
TO
A
LARGER
MARKET
THAT
MUST
THEN
BE
COMPENSATED
BY
RAISING
PRICES
IN
OTHER
AREAS
PERHAPS
THERE
IS
A
COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE
IN
THERE
AFTER
ALL
WOULD
NOT
REPUTABLE
AND
DEDICATED
PHYSICIANS
PREFER
TO
AFFILIATE
WITH
AN
INSTITUTION
THAT
OFFERS
DIALYSIS
SERVICES
WOULD
THEY
NOT
THEREFORE
TEND
TO
ADMIT
PATIENTS
IN
GREATER
NUMBERS
TO
AN
INSTITUTION
THAT
OFFERED
A
FULL
RANGE
OF
DIAGNOSTIC
AND
TREATMENT
OPTIONS
UNDOUBTEDLY
IN
FACT
IT
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
HOSPITALS
FREQUENTLY
COMPETE
FOR
PHYSICIANS
RATHER
THAN
FOR
PATIENTS
THAT
IN
PART
COMPLICATES
AND
UNDERMINES
A
SIMPLISTIC
FREEMARKET
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
MARKET
FOR
MEDICAL
CARE
HOSPITALS
TEND
TO
LOSE
MONEY
ON
ALL
SORTS
OF
HIGHTECH
HIGHPRICE
MACHINERY
THEY
MANAGE
TO
MAKE
IT
UP
ON
OTHER
CHARGES
ONCE
AGAIN
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THIS
IS
TRUE
IN
REGARD
TO
KIDNEY
DIALYSIS
ALTHOUGH
PRICE
CONTROLS
HAVE
PROMOTED
AN
EXPANSION
OF
SERVICES
TO
A
MUCH
GREATER
VOLUME
OF
PATIENTS
RD
IS
STILL
A
PROFITABLE
SERVICE
OTHERWISE
ONE
WOULD
EXPECT
TO
SEE
EVIDENCE
OF
RATIONING
RATHER
THAN
THE
VAST
EXPANSION
THAT
HAS
OCCURRED
REMEMBER
THE
NOTION
THAT
YOU
CAN
LOSE
A
LITTLE
ON
EACH
TREATMENT
BUT
MAKE
IT
UP
IN
VOLUME
IS
NOT
GOOD
ECONOMICS
EVEN
IN
A
FREE
MARKET
THEN
HOW
DO
YOU
EXPLAIN
WHY
GROCERY
STORES
ROUTINELY
OFFER
AN
ARRAY
OF
PRODUCTS
AT
PRICES
BELOW
COST
ARE
NOT
GROCERY
STORES
EMBEDDED
IN
A
RELATIVELY
FREE
MARKET
CAN
YOU
SPELL
LOSS
LEADER
I
KNEW
YOU
COULD
GROCERY
STORES
DO
NOT
ATTEMPT
TO
MAKE
UP
THE
LOSS
ON
AN
INDIVIDUAL
PRODUCT
BY
SELLING
MORE
OF
IT
IN
FACT
YOUR
ARGUMENT
ABOVE
IS
THAT
KIDNEY
DIALYSIS
IS
A
LOSS
LEADER
FOR
OTHER
MEDICAL
TREATMENTS
WHERE
LOST
REVENUE
CAN
BE
REGAINED
BUT
THE
EVIDENCE
DOES
NOT
SUPPORT
THIS
CONTENTION
RATHER
IT
APPEARS
THAT
PRICE
CONTROLS
HAVE
DISCIPLINED
THE
MARKET
BY
FORCING
AN
EXPANSION
OF
SERVICE
AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF
IMPROVED
LOWERCOST
TECHNOLOGY
TO
PROVIDE
COMPARABLE
BENEFITS
PROVIDERS
CONTINUE
TO
PROFIT
FROM
RD
THEY
SIMPLY
MAKE
LESS
ON
EACH
TREATMENT
THAN
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
IF
THE
PRICE
HAD
RISEN
AT
THE
RATE
THAT
UNCONTROLLED
TREATMENTS
HAVE
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
HAD
PRICE
CONTROLS
FORCED
THE
PRICE
OF
RD
SUBSTANTIALLY
BELOW
ITS
ACTUAL
COST
THAT
SOME
OR
ALL
OF
THE
DOOMSDAY
PREDICTIONS
OF
FREEMARKET
ADVOCATES
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SEEN
RESTRICTION
OF
SERVICE
LAGGING
TECHNOLOGICAL
DEVELOPMENT
ETC
LIKEWISE
IT
APPEARS
THAT
IN
THE
VA
AND
ARMED
FORCES
MEDICAL
CARE
SYSTEMS
WHERE
PROVIDERS
ARE
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
SOME
OF
THESE
NEGATIVE
IMPACTS
MAY
OCCUR
RD
PATIENTS
IN
THE
VA
SYSTEM
IN
SPOKANE
FOR
EXAMPLE
MUST
TRAVEL
TO
SEATTLE
MILES
AWAY
FOR
TREATMENT
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
HOWEVER
IS
THAT
THIS
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
OF
A
RATHER
EXTREME
SORT
THAT
APPEARS
TO
HAVE
HAD
BENEFICIAL
RESULTS
FOR
BOTH
PROVIDERS
AND
CONSUMERS
CLAIMS
THAT
