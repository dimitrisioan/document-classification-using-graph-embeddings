I
THINK
WHAT
YOU
MEANT
TO
SAY
HERE
WAS
WITH
THE
CURRENT
MUTATION
OF
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
UNDER
THE
CURRENT
POLICE
STATE
SOMEONE
MAY
BE
CHARGED
MULTIPLE
TIMES
FOR
ONE
ACT
IF
THE
VICTIM
IN
QUESTION
IS
OF
THE
RIGHT
SHADE
A
SINGLE
ACT
SHOULD
NEVER
MERIT
MORE
THAN
ON
CHARGE
SO
IF
I
SET
OFF
A
BOMB
IN
THE
WORLD
TRADE
CENTER
I
CAN
ONLY
BE
CHARGED
WITH
MORE
THAN
ONE
MURDER
AND
NOT
THE
OTHER
FIVE
DEATHS
AND
EXTENSIVE
PROPERTY
DAMAGE
AFTER
ALL
THE
BOMB
WAS
A
SINGLE
ACT
TED
FRANK
HOWEVER
TEEL
SHOULD
HAVE
MENTIONED
THAT
THOUGH
AGAIN
MR
FRANK
HAS
COME
TO
THE
RESCUE
WITH
HIS
COOL
HEADED
REASON
HOW
ABOUT
ONE
CHARGE
PER
VICTIM
OF
COURSE
ILL
THINK
ABOUT
IT
IN
A
FEW
DAYS
AND
FIND
A
CASE
WHERE
THIS
DOESNT
APPLY
EITHER
WHAT
THE
HECK
I
DONT
STUDY
LAW
I
JUST
HATE
LAWYERS
