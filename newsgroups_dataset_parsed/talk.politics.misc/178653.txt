HE
NOTES

AND
ELSEWHERE
FOR

ITS
THE
CANADIANS
AND
OTHERS
WHO
COME
HERE
WHY
SHOULD
THE

DUPLICATE
WHAT
DOESNT

WE

JOHN
F
MCMANUS
NATIONAL
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
JOHN
BIRCH
SOCIETY
WHEN
MCMANUS
SAYS
WE
HAVE
THE
WORLDS
BEST
MEDICAL
CARE
I
CAN
HARDLY
BELIEVE
HES
REFERRING
TO
A
SYSTEM
THAT
COSTS
US
PERCENT
OF
OUR
GDP
WHILE
THERE
ISNT
A
SINGLE
OTHER
COUNTRY
IN
THE
INDUSTRIALIZED
WORLD
THAT
SPENDS
MORE
THAN
PERCENT
THAT
LEAVES
MILLION
OF
US
WITH
NO
COVERAGE
EVEN
THOUGH
ALL
THE
OTHER
SYSTEMS
IN
THE
INDUSTRIALIZED
WORLD
COVER
VIRTUALLY
EVERYONE
YET
AMERICANS
RANK
NEAR
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
LIST
IN
TERMS
OF
LIFE
EXPECTANCY
CHILDHOOD
IMMUNIZATION
RATE
INFANT
MORTALITY
AND
MANY
PREVENTABLE
DISEASES
WE
PAY
ON
AVERAGE
ABOUT
EACH
FOR
MRIS
TO
PUT
THAT
IN
PERSPECTIVE
THEY
COST
IN
JAPAN
THE
AVERAGE
US
COMPANY
SPENDS
OVER
DOLLARS
A
YEAR
PER
EMPLOYEE
ON
HEALTH
BENEFITS
SEVEN
HUNDRED
TO
IS
THE
RANGE
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYWHERE
ELSE
HOW
CAN
ANYONE
SAY
THAT
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
IS
THE
BEST
IN
THE
WORLD
THE
ONLY
THING
THE
USA
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
IS
GOOD
AT
IS
SHOWERING
WELLINSURED
PATIENTS
WITH
A
CHAMPAGNE
TREATMENT
OF
CARE
AND
OUTRAGEOUSLY
OVERCHARGING
FOR
IT
AND
THE
PRIVATE
SYSTEM
OF
INSURERS
AND
PAPERWORK
IS
SO
BLOATED
AND
INEFFICIENT
THAT
IT
ITSELF
SUCKS
UP
OVER
BILLION
DOLLARS
A
YEAR
IN
MONEY
FROM
EVERY
OTHER
SECTOR
OF
SOCIETY
INDIVIDUALS
GOVERNMENT
AND
INDUSTRY
OF
THE
BILLION
DOLLARS
AMERICANS
THREW
INTO
THE
BOTTOMLESS
PIT
OF
HEALTH
CARE
COSTS
LAST
YEAR
THE
CONSUMERS
UNION
ESTIMATED
THAT
AT
LEAST
BILLION
WAS
THROWN
AWAY
ON
OVERPRICED
USELESS
AND
EVEN
DOWNRIGHT
HARMFUL
TESTS
AND
PROCEDURES
AND
THE
MOST
BUREAUCRATIC
REGULATED
INSURANCE
SYSTEM
IN
THE
WORLD
THERE
ARE
MORE
THAN
DIFFERENT
PRIVATE
INSURERS
IN
THE
USA
BUT
DID
THE
PRIVATE
COMPETITION
STIMULATE
MORE
EFFICIENT
PAPERWORK
ASK
ANY
DOCTOR
WHOS
HAD
TO
HIRE
A
FULLTIME
CLERK
TO
DEAL
WITH
IT
ALL
THE
COMPETITION
AMONG
HOSPITALS
IS
DRIVING
COSTS
UP
NOT
DOWN
THE
COMPETITION
AMONG
HOSPITALS
FOR
BOTH
DOCTORS
AND
PATIENTS
HAS
ENCOURAGED
THE
HOSPITALS
TO
TRAFFIC
IN
EXPENSIVE
SUPERFLUOUS
EQUIPMENT
SPENDING
MILLIONS
ON
EXPENSIVE
MACHINES
OF
DUBIOUS
VALUE
THAT
SPEND
PERCENT
OF
THE
DAY
IDLE
ISNT
MY
IDEA
OF
THE
WORLDS
BEST
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
COMPETITION
AMONG
SPECIALISTS
IS
DRIVING
THEM
TO
PERFORM
DANGEROUS
AND
EXPENSIVE
PROCEDURES
WHERE
THEY
ARE
VERY
MARGINALLY
HELPFUL
IM
ESPECIALLY
THINKING
OF
HEART
SURGERY
AND
SOME
WOMENS
SURGERIES
LIKE
HYSTERECTOMY
AND
CESAREAN
SECTION
SOUND
LIKE
THE
WORLDS
BEST
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
EVER
NOTICE
HOW
EVERY
TIME
SOMEONE
TRIES
TO
BRING
ABOUT
SOME
REAL
CHANGE
IN
HEALTH
CARE
THE
LIBBIES
START
BASHING
CANADAS
SYSTEM
FIRST
OF
ALL
HILLARY
CLINTON
IS
NOT
ADVOCATING
ANOTHER
CANADIAN
SYSTEM
I
THINK
THATS
BEEN
MADE
ABUNDANTLY
CLEAR
IN
THE
NEWS
FOR
THE
LAST
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
WHERE
DID
JOHN
F
MCMANUS
GET
THAT
IDEA
ANYWAY
LETS
SAY
YOURE
A
CANADIAN
LIVING
IN
A
SMALL
TOWN
NEAR
THE
USA
BORDER
YOUR
CHILD
NEEDS
A
COMPLICATED
PROCEDURE
ONLY
AVAILABLE
IN
CITY
HOSPITALS
THE
NEAREST
CANADIAN
CITIES
ARE
HOURS
WEST
AND
HOURS
EAST
AND
THERES
AN
AMERICAN
CITY
ONE
HOUR
SOUTH
WHICH
WAY
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
GO
IS
IT
BECAUSE
THE
AMERICAN
SYSTEM
IS
THE
BEST
IN
THE
WORLD
OR
JUST
FOR
CONVENIENCE
IT
STILL
AMAZES
ME
THAT
PEOPLE
CANT
SEEM
TO
SEE
MORE
THAN
JUST
BLACK
AND
WHITE
ON
HEALTH
CARE
REFORM
THERE
ARE
A
MILLION
DIFFERENT
WAYS
WE
OULD
RESTRUCTURE
THE
SYSTEM
ITS
NOT
JUST
A
CHOICE
BETWEEN
TOTAL
GOVERNMENT
CONTROL
AND
TOTAL
PRIVATE
CONTROL
I
WISH
THE
PEOPLE
SCREAMING
SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE
EVERY
TIME
SOEMONE
WANTS
TO
CHANGE
THE
CURRENT
SYSTE
WOULD
INFORM
THEMSELVES
ON
HEALTH
CARE
ISSUES
THE
CURRENT
SYSTEM
SUCKS
I
WANT
TO
KEEP
PROVIDERS
PRIVATE
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
CHANGE
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
WILL
NEVER
BE
ABLE
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
DEFICIT
IF
WE
DONT
REFORM
THE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
PURELY
PRIVATE
HEALTH
CARE
WITHOUT
ANY
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
DOESNT
WORK
HILLARY
CLINTON
IS
NOT
THINKING
OF
NATIONALIZING
PROVIDERS
OR
EVERN
INSURERS
HOW
CAN
YOU
SCREAM
SOCIALIZED
MEDICINE
AT
HER
PROGRAMS
DONT
YOU
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
EVER
SEE
CLINTONS
GRAPHS
OF
PROJECTED
DEFICIT
VERSUS
YEAR
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
DECADE
NOTICE
HOW
THE
LINE
FALLS
THEN
STARTS
INCREASING
WHY
ILL
GIVE
YOU
ONE
WILD
GUESS
AS
TO
WHICH
COMPONENT
OF
SPENDING
WILL
OVERWHELM
US
IF
WE
DONT
DO
SOMETHING
ABOUT
IT
PEOPE
JUST
DOESNT
GET
IT
THE
CURRENT
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
IS
A
CANCER
WHICH
IS
KILLING
OUR
ECONOMIC
WELLBEING
COSTS
ARE
STILL
RISING
PERCENT
A
YEAR
EVEN
AS
AMERICANS
BY
THE
TENS
OF
MILLIONS
GO
WITHOUT
OR
ARE
FORCED
INTO
MANAGEDCARE
PROGRAMS
WHICH
ARE
CERTAINLY
PRETTY
SOCIALIZED
ALREADY
IF
YOU
ASK
ME
A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
AGO
I
POSTED
A
MESSAGE
ASKING
ANY
HILLARYBASHERS
TO
PLEASE
COME
FORWARD
AND
PRESENT
NO
GIMMICKS
STRAIGHT
TALK
JUST
HOW
THEY
WOULD
SET
ABOUT
KEEPING
COSTS
DOWN
I
DIDNT
GET
A
SINGLE
ANSWER
THE
ONLY
THING
I
KEEP
HEARING
FROM
LIBBIE
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
PRESS
RELEASES
FILLED
WITH
EVASIVE
PLATITUDES
LIKE
GIVE
HEALTH
CARE
BACK
TO
THE
PEOPLE
JUST
DO
YOU
EXPECT
TO
DO
THAT
WITHOUT
SERIOUS
REFORMS
WHAT
IS
IT
ABOUT
THE
CURRENT
SYSTEM
THAT
YOU
WOULD
CHANGE
AND
HOW
WOULD
THAT
HELP
HOW
CAN
ANYONE
READ
THE
NEWS
LIVE
UNDER
OUR
SYSTEM
AND
NOT
SEE
THESE
FAULTS
HOW
CAN
WE
DEAL
WITH
THE
DEFICIT
OUR
CITIES
OUR
EDUCATIONAL
SYSTEM
OUR
INFRASTRUCURE
AIDS
MODERNIZING
OUR
INDUSTRY
ETC
IF
WE
DONT
QUIT
THROWING
AWAY
MONEY
WHICH
COULD
BE
USED
TO
SOLVE
THOSE
PROBLEMS
AMERICA
NEEDS
HEALTH
CARE
REFORM
NOW
DONT
JUST
SIT
THERE
AND
HILLARYBASH
INFORM
YOURSELF
JIM
REYNOLDS
JAMES
P
REYNOLDS
THATS
JIM
TO
YOU
AND
ME
