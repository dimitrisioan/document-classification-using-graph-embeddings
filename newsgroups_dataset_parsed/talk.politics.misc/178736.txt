WACO
AND
PANAMA
I
HAVENT
RECOGNIZED
ANY
NAMES
FROM
PREVIOUS
DISCUSSIONS
BUT
I
DO
NOTICE
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
WHO
BLAME
CLINTON
FOR
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
BATF
IN
WACO
UNLESS
YOU
FELT
THE
SAME
WAY
ABOUT
WHAT
WE
DID
UNDER
BUSHS
DIRECT
COMMAND
IN
PANAMA
ITS
JUST
PARTISAN
WHINING
WHICH
IS
WHAT
I
EXPECT
MOST
OF
IT
TO
BE
I
CAN
SEE
NO
WAY
TO
CONDEMN
ONE
AND
NOT
THE
OTHER
BUT
IM
SURE
SOME
LIMBOT
WILL
TELL
ME
HOW
KILLING
THOUSANDS
OF
PANAMANIAN
CIVILIANS
TO
SERVE
AN
ARREST
WARRANT
IS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
ALLOWING
RELIGIOUS
FANATICS
TO
COMMIT
SUICIDE
FOLLOWING
A
BOTCHED
ATTEMPT
BY
THE
BATF
TO
SERVE
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
