only
month
ahhh
remember
the
days
of
yesterday
when
we
were
only
going
to
pay
month
when
only
of
the
population
would
pay
extra
taxes
remember
when
a
few
of
us
predicted
that
it
wasnt
true
remember
the
inaugural
dancing
and
singing
liberation
at
last
well
figure
this
out
vat
estimated
to
raise
billion
per
year
on
cnn
work
it
out
chum
taxpayers
year
but
you
exclaim
ill
get
free
health
care
but
i
exclaim
no
you
wont
this
is
only
for
that
poor
million
who
have
none
not
for
you
chum
that
comes
later
add
in
the
estimates
of
the
energy
tax
costs
year
plus
all
that
extra
corporate
and
rich
taxes
that
will
trickle
down
and
what
do
you
have
year
just
like
i
said
two
months
ago
and
the
best
part
you
dont
get
anything
for
it
deficit
is
still
projected
to
rise
at
same
rate
its
been
rising
at
by
clintons
own
estimates
and
this
assumes
that
his
plan
will
work
i
mean
come
on
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
see
that
in
another
or
years
were
getting
another
whopping
tax
increase
because
the
deficit
will
still
be
growing
faster
than
the
economy
all
clinton
is
doing
is
moving
us
to
a
higher
diving
board
face
it
clinton
is
bush
x
in
four
more
years
our
country
will
be
completely
bankrupt
and
your
childrens
future
so
oft
mentioned
by
pal
bill
will
be
gone
and
those
of
you
still
deluding
yourselves
will
be
faced
with
the
guilt
well
glancing
at
watch
gotta
go
i
want
to
be
out
of
here
by
noon
got
an
appointment
at
the
lake
no
tax
there
yet
