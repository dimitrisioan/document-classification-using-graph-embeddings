STEVE
YOURE
THE
ONE
WHO
SUGGESTED
THAT
A
FAILED
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
BE
AN
IDEAL
PROVING
GROUND
I
NEVER
FELT
THAT
WAY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
QUITE
THE
CONTRARY
I
THINK
A
BETTER
PROVING
GROUND
WOULD
BE
SOMEPLACE
THAT
ALREADY
HAD
A
GOVERNEMNT
THAT
WOULD
PREVENT
OUTRIGHT
ACTS
OF
AGRESSION
YET
HAD
A
STRONG
SPIRIT
OF
INDIVIDUALISM
AND
INITIATIVE
SOMEPLACE
LIKE
TEXAS
MR
GRINCH
AND
WHILE
TEXAS
TAXPAYERS
MIGHT
WILLINGLY
ELIMINATE
TAXSUPPORT
FOR
UT
AND
TAMU
IM
NOT
SURE
THEYD
SUPPORT
GUTTING

THERES
THE
IMPACT
ON
ROSS
PEROTS
FORTUNE
OF
ELIMINATING
THE
VARIOUS
STATE
SUPPORTED

TEXAS

SEEM
TO
BE
A
VERY
LIKELY
PLACE
FOR
LIBERTARIANISM
TO
TAKE
HOLD
MORE
LIKELY
THAN
MOST
PLACES
WHEN
I
WAS
THERE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
STATE
ISSUE
WAS
WHETHER
TO
HAVE
A
STATE
INCOME
TAX
OR
INSTEAD
LEGALIZE
A
POPULAR
VICE
FOR
FUND
RAISING
AND
VICE
WON
A
DECISIVE
VICTORY
JSH
MR
GRINCH
PS
NOW
THAT

SAFELY
DEAD

EXPECT
DAVID

BECOME
THE
HERO
OF
POPULAR
FOLK
BALLADS
AND
THE
ATF
TO
BE
GENERALLY
EQUATED
WITH
SANTA
