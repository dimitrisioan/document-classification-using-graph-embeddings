RE
RNITEDACE
AND
VIOLENCE
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
YOU
RECOGNIZE
THAT
PEOPLE
SHOULD
NOT
ENGAGE
IN
DENIAL
AND
REPRESSION
AND
SHOULD
ACKNOWLEDGE
SUCH
THE
UNITED
STATES
WITH
ITS
PEOPLE
HAVE
RECOGNIZED
THAT
REPRESSION
HAS
TAKEN
PLACE
WITH
THE
LOSS
AND
OUTRIGHT
ABROGATION
OF
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
AND
CONSTITUTIONAL
PROTECTIONS
OF
CITIZENS
THIS
RECOGNITION
HAS
TAKEN
THE
FORM
OF
THE
CIVIL
RIGHTS
LAW
LETS
JUST
DISCUSS
THE
FEDERAL
LEVEL
FOR
NOW
SUCH
AS
USC
ET
SEQ
USC
ET
SEQ
ET
AL
WITH
THIS
RECOGNITION
OF
REPRESSION
AT
TIMES
MANIFESTED
IN
THE
FORM
OF
COLLECTIVE
GUILT
I
WANT
PEOPLE
TO
RECOGNIZE
DENIAL
THOUGH
IT
CAN
BE
SAID
THAT
WHITE
PEOPLE
NUMERICALLY
COMMIT
MORE
CRIMES
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
BECAUSE
WHITE
PEOPLE
ARE
A
MAJORITY
IT
CAN
ALSO
BE
SAID
THAT
BLACK
PEOPLE
COMMIT
A
DISPROPORTIONATE
AMOUNT
OF
CRIME
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
IN
THEIR
RELATION
TO
THEIR
NUMBERS
IN
POPULATION
MY
VIEWS
ARE
OUT
OF
EXPERIENCES
WHEN
I
WAS
A
POLICE
OFFICER
IN
A
LARGE
METROPOLITAN
AREA
AND
OF
A
CITIZEN
UNLESS
PEOPLE
ACCOUNT
FOR
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
AND
FOR
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THEIR
IMMEDIATE
COMMUNITY
NOTHING
WILL
IMPROVE
REGARDS
NEAL
