IS
AN
UNBORN
CHILD
A
HUMAN
BEING
AT
ANY
POINT
DURING
PREGNENCY
IN
MY
OPINION
AT
ALL
POINTS
DURING
THE
PREGNANCY
IT
IS
HUMAN
YOULL
HAVE
TO
DEFINE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
HUMAN
BEING
FOR
ME
TO
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
AS
PUT
A
PARALLEL
Q
IS
A
PERSON
OF
COLOR
A
HUMAN
BEING
A
YOULL
HAVE
TO
DEFINE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
HUMAN
BEING
TO
ANSWER
YOUR
IRRELEVANT
QUESTION
YES
A
PERSON
OF
COLOR
IS
HUMAN
BUT
I
STILL
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
HUMAN
BEING
AND
YOU
HAVE
MERELY
BEGGED
THE
QUESTION
WITHOUT
RESPONDING
BY
TRYING
TO
INJECT
THE
NOTION
OF
RACE
INTO
THE
DISCUSSION
YOU
MUDDY
THE
WATERS
WITHOUT
ADDING
ANY
INSIGHT
WHATEVER
THE
SAME
PARALLEL
QUESTION
COULD
BE
IS
A
POLYDACTYL
PERSON
A
HUMAN
BEING
YOU
STILL
HAVE
NOT
ANSWERED
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
HUMAN
BEING
PLEASE
DO
SO
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
LEGAL
PRECEDENT
DEFINES
A
HUMAN
BEING
IE
A
PERSON
WHOSE
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
THE
LAW
AS
SOMEONE
WITH
A
FUNCTIONING
BRAIN
COULD
YOU
CITE
SOME
OF
THOSE
PRECEDENTS
FOR
ME
OR
THE
BASIS
OF
THIS
DEFINITION
WHILE
THE
LAW
DOES
ALLOW
THE
REMOVAL
OF
EXTRAORDINARY
MEANS
OF
SUSTAINING
LIFE
IN
CASES
OF
BRAIN
DEATH
THIS
IN
ITSELF
DOES
NOT
LEAD
TO
YOUR
CONCLUSION
OF
HOW
THE
LAW
DEFINES
A
HUMAN
BEING
HOWEVER
AT
LEAST
YOU
DEFINED
HUMAN
BEING
IN
A
TENUOUS
FASHION
THAT
IS
A
PERSON
WHOSE
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
THE
LAW
FOR
MY
ANSWER
TO
YOUR
QUESTION
I
REFER
YOU
TO
ROE
V
WADE
AND
SUBSEQUENT
SUPREME
COURT
DECISIONS
WHICH
DEFINE
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
A
FETUS
IS
PROTECTED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
THE
LAW
CERTAIN
JUDGES
HAVE
CONCURRED
THAT
SLAVERY
IS
NOT
A
VIOLATION
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
THEREFORE
IT
IS
NOT
YOU
WONT
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
AND
INSTEAD
DRAG
IN
IRRELEVANCIES
IF
YOU
WANT
A
DEFINITION
OF
HUMAN
BEING
THAT
DOES
NOT
DEPEND
ON
THE
VAGARIES
OF
LAW
BUT
HOLDS
SOLID
WHATEVER
THE
LAW
MAY
RULE
PROVIDE
IT
FOR
ME
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
YOUR
BLIND
FAITH
WOULD
NOT
LIKELY
HOLD
UP
IF
THE
SHOE
WERE
ON
THE
OTHER
FOOT
THE
BRAIN
LIFEDEATH
PARADIGM
IS
ONE
THAT
I
SUGGEST
AS
ONE
CONSISTENT
WITH
OTHER
LEGAL
DEFINITIONS
IT
CLEARLY
DOESNT
MATTER
TO
YOU
WHETHER
AN
UNBORN
CHILD
HAS
ANY
RIGHTS
OR
NOT
HOWEVER
SO
THE
POINT
IS
LOST
ON
YOU
MORE
IRRELEVANCIES
AS
LARRY
MARGOLIS
POINTED
OUT
THE
LAW
HAS
MADE
SPECIAL
EXCEPTIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
INCLUDE
FETUSES
BUT
DOES
NOT
FOLLOW
YOUR
VERSION
OF
HUMAN
BEING
AND
AS
HE
POINTED
OUT
BRAIN
DEATH
IS
NOT
A
MEANS
OF
DETERMINING
WHO
HAS
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THE
LIVING
BUT
RATHER
WHO
HAS
DIED
THERE
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
WHAT
I
AM
WONDERING
NOW
IS
HAS
YOUR
ARGUMENT
SO
FAILED
YOU
THAT
YOU
FEEL
IT
NECESSARY
TO
DRAG
OUT
IRRELEVANCIES
AND
LEAVE
THE
THREAD
YOU
STARTED
YOU
GOT
ANSWERS
TO
YOUR
QUESTIONS
WHEN
YOU
BEGAN
BAITING
ME
IF
YOU
RECALL
AFTER
YOU
HAD
MADE
SOME
RIDICULOUS
REMARKS
ABOUT
ADRIENNE
REGARD
AND
HAVING
BEEN
CORRECTED
CHANGED
THE
SUBJECT
WITH
YOUR
REMARKS
ABOUT
HAVING
A
DISCUSSION
OF
SUBSTANCE
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANTED
A
DISCUSSION
OF
SUBSTANCE
WHY
THEN
DO
YOU
DISREGARD
LOGIC
AND
SUBSTANCE
IN
ORDER
TO
TOSS
SILLY
ACCUSSATIONS
EG
IT
REALLY
DOESNT
MATTER
TO
YOU
IF
IT
MATTERS
TO
YOU
THEN
WHY
NOT
DEFINE
HUMAN
BEING
AND
SEEK
SOME
SUBSTANCE
YOURE
NOT
GOING
TO
CONVINCE
A
LOGICAL
PERSON
OF
THE
RIGHTNESS
OF
YOUR
POSITION
UNLESS
YOU
APPLY
SOME
LOGIC
AND
SHOW
SOME
MEANING
TO
YOUR
WORDS
IF
SHE
IS
THEN
WHY
DOES
THE
MOTHER
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
KILL
HER
WHEN
SHE
IS
IN
THE
WOMB
BUT
NOT
AFTER
SHE
HAS
PASSED
THROUGH
THE
BIRTH
CANAL
BECAUSE
A
WOMAN
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
ANY
OBJECT
WHICH
THREATENS
HER
HEALTH
AND
IS
WITHIN
THE
CONFINES
OF
HER
BODY
REMOVED
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
ARGUMENT
WOULD
GIVE
RIGHTS
TO
THE
FETUS
THAT
WOULD
NOT
BE
GRANTED
TO
AN
ADULT
HUMAN
IF
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
WERE
OCCUPYING
THE
BODY
OF
ANOTHER
FOR
WHATEVER
REASON
OR
THROUGH
WHATEVER
MEANS
THE
REASON
AND
MEANS
BEING
IRRELEVANT
THAT
OTHER
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
REMOVE
OR
HAVE
YOU
REMOVED
IF
THAT
REMOVAL
REQUIRED
YOUR
DEMISE
I
SEE
NO
REASON
IN
LAW
THAT
SUCH
A
REMOVAL
COULD
NOT
BE
EFFECTED
RATHER
THAN
EXAMINING
A
HYPOTHETICAL
THOUGHT
EXPERIMENT
LET
US
EXAMINE
A
REAL
THOUGH
RARE
SITUATION
SIAMESE
TWINS
IF
ONE
SIAMESE
TWIN
HAS
THE
OTHER
SURGICALLY
REMOVED
KNOWING
THAT
IT
WILL
CAUSE
DEATH
AND
BARRING
SOME
EMERGENCY
WHERE
THEY
WILL
BOTH
DIE
ANYWAY
IT
IS
MURDER
IS
IT
HAVE
YOU
ANY
SUPPORT
FOR
THIS
ASSERTION
FURTHERMORE
YOUR
ANALOGY
IS
COMPLETELY
INAPPLICABLE
SIAMESE
TWINS
HAVE
AN
EQUAL
CLAIM
TO
ANY
BODY
PARTS
THEY
HAVE
IN
COMMON
TRY
AGAIN
WHAT
ESTABLISHES
THIS
EQUAL
CLAIM
BEYOND
YOUR
ASSERTION
IF
IT
IS
MERELY
A
MATTER
OF
WHICH
CAME
FIRST
CANNOT
ONE
KILL
THE
OTHER
SINCE
THEY
BOTH
HAVE
EQUAL
CLAIM
WHAT
IF
ONE
HAS
MORE
MOTOR
CONTROL
THAN
THE
OTHER
DOES
THAT
ESTABLISH
A
SUPERIOR
CLAIM
AS
OTHERS
POINT
OUT
ONE
IS
SACRIFICED
FOR
THE
OTHER
DEPENDING
ON
WHICH
HAS
THE
BETTER
CHANCE
AT
SURVIVAL
AGAIN
YOUR
ANALOGY
FAILS
NOT
PRECEDENCE
BUT
POSSESSION
MAKES
A
DIFFERENCE
HERE
A
WOMANS
WOMB
IS
INDISPUTABLY
HER
OWN
ALSO
I
SEE
YOU
IGNORE
MY
STATEMENT
THAT
YOU
WOULD
GRANT
RIGHTS
TO
A
FETUS
THAT
WOULD
NOT
BE
GRANTED
A
BORN
HUMAN
BEING
WAS
THAT
DUE
TO
ITS
INCONVENIENCE
YOU
SEE
THE
RIGHT
TO
LIFE
IS
GRANTED
TO
ADULT
HUMANS
IN
THE
SAME
SENSE
AS
IT
SHOULD
BE
TO
THE
FOETUS
AT
SOME
POINT
PRIOR
TO
BIRTH
ARE
SIAMESE
TWINS
EVER
SEPARATED
IN
THE
WOMB
OR
IS
THIS
RIGHT
YOU
ASSERT
FOR
SIAMESE
TWINS
WHICH
I
DONT
EVEN
THINK
IS
TRUE
AS
STATED
OR
VALID
AS
AN
ANALOGY
ONE
THAT
EXISTS
AFTER
BIRTH
FREIVALD
YOUR
ENTIRE
ARGUMENT
HERE
IS
A
FAILURE
INTERESTING
WAY
OF
TRYING
TO
COMBINE
TWO
ESSENTIALLY
ORTHOGONAL
CONCEPTS
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
IT
IS
MURDER
FOR
ONE
SIAMESE
TWIN
TO
KILL
THE
OTHER
REGARDLESS
OF
THEIR
STATUS
OF
PHYSIOLOGICAL
DEPENDENCE
OR
INTERDEPENDENCE
IS
IT
PLEASE
CITE
A
PRECEDENT
AND
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
RULING
IT
WOULD
BE
DIFFICULT
FOR
ONE
SIAMESE
TWIN
TO
KILL
THE
OTHER
INSIDE
THE
WOMB
AND
EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
POSSIBLE
I
DOUBT
THAT
A
CASE
COULD
BE
MADE
FOR
PREMEDITATION
OR
NEGLEGENCE
NOTE
THE
USE
OF
THE
PHRASE
IT
SHOULD
BE
IN
MY
POST
YOU
SIMPLY
ASSERT
THINGS
WITHOUT
ANY
SUPPORT
YOUR
ANALOGY
IS
NOT
ACCURATE
AND
YOUR
ASSERTIONS
ARE
UNSUPPORTED
TRY
THIS
ON
FOR
SIZE
IT
IS
NOT
MURDER
FOR
ONE
SIAMESE
TWIN
TO
KILL
THE
OTHER
IN
THE
WOMB
THERE
WE
NOW
HAVE
EQUAL
ARGUMENTS
BUT
THE
IDEA
IS
ILLOGICAL
FOR
ONE
SIAMESE
TWIN
TO
KILL
THE
OTHER
IN
THE
WOMB
WOULD
LIKELY
BE
TO
KILL
ITSELF
AS
WELL
THE
SYSTEMS
ARE
DEPENDENT
ON
EACH
OTHER
FOR
LIFE
IM
STILL
STRUGGLING
TO
SEE
ANYTHING
ANALAGOUS
HERE
AND
FAILING
TO
DO
SO
OF
COURSE
THE
SITUATION
IS
NOT
A
PERFECT
COMPARISON
IT
MAY
WELL
BE
THAT
ONE
SIAMESE
TWIN
DELIBERATELY
INITIATES
OPPRESSION
OR
COERSION
AGAINST
THE
OTHER
THIS
IS
CLEARLY
NOT
THE
CASE
WITH
AN
UNBORN
CHILD
AND
THIS
LAST
STATEMENT
FROM
YOU
IS
A
TOTAL
NON
SEQUITUR
THE
COMPARISON
IS
FAR
WORSE
THAN
YOU
GIVE
IT
CREDIT
FOR
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
LET
THIS
ASSERTION
STAND
ON
ITS
OWN
ALSO
OR
DO
YOU
PLAN
ON
FOLLOWING
UP
WITH
A
REASONED
ARGUMENT
YOUR
ARGUMENT
IS
FROM
FANTASY
ISLAND
YOUR
COMPARISON
IS
A
TOTAL
FAILURE
AS
I
HAVE
DEMONSTRATED
ALREADY
AND
HAS
NO
BASIS
IN
REALITY
NEITHER
LEGALLY
NOR
MEDICALLY
AND
FOR
YOU
TO
ASSERT
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
A
PERFECT
COMPARISON
BECAUSE
OF
THE
IMPOSSIBLE
THAT
OF
COERCION
OR
OPPRESSION
IS
RIDICULOUS
AS
I
SAID
YOU
GIVE
THE
ANALOGY
TOO
LITTLE
CREDIT
FOR
FAILURE
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
YOU
START
THIS
BY
SAYING
YOU
WANT
TO
TAKE
A
REAL
RATHER
THAN
A
HYPOTHETICAL
SITUATION
THEN
YOU
FLY
OFF
INTO
SIAMESE
TWINS
MURDERING
ONE
ANOTHER
IN
THE
WOMB
OR
COERCING
OR
OPPRESSING
EACH
OTHER
IN
THE
WOMB
WHEN
THE
REALITY
OF
THE
SITUATION
YOU
DESCRIBE
IN
NOW
WAY
MATCHES
YOUR
VERSION
AS
I
SAID
BEFORE
DECISIONS
ARE
MADE
REGARDING
WHICH
TWIN
LIVES
AND
DIES
IN
SITUATIONS
WHERE
THEY
CANNOT
BOTH
SURVIVE
AND
FURTHERMORE
AS
I
HAVE
ALREADY
SAID
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AN
EQUAL
CLAIM
TO
ORGANS
AND
A
CLAIM
THAT
IS
UNEQUAL
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
ASSERTING
THAT
A
FETUS
HAS
A
CLAIM
ON
A
WOMANS
WOMB
WHEN
THE
FETUS
IS
BORN
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
ITS
CLAIM
AND
BY
WHAT
REASON
DO
YOU
ASSERT
ITS
CLAIM
IF
A
PARENT
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
CHOOSE
TO
NOT
TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THEIR
OWN
CHILD
WHY
ARE
THERE
LAWS
AND
PENALTIES
AGAINST
CHILD
ABANDONMENT
THIS
LAST
QUESTION
IS
IRRELEVANT
AND
SOMETHING
OF
A
NON
SEQUITUR
CAN
YOU
ESTABLISH
SOME
RELEVANCE
OR
EVEN
SOME
SENSE
FOR
IT
IF
AT
SOME
POINT
AN
UNBORN
CHILD
IS
A
HUMAN
BEING
THE
PARENTS
CLEARLY
HAVE
THE
SAME
RESPONSIBILITIES
TOWARD
HER
AS
ANY
OTHER
PARENTS
HAVE
TOWARD
THEIR
CHILDREN
AGAIN
WHAT
IS
THE
RELEVANCE
YOU
HAVE
ESTABLISHED
NO
SENSE
OF
WHEN
THAT
POINT
IS
YOU
IGNORE
THE
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
FETUS
AND
A
BORN
CHILD
THE
DEPENDENCE
OF
A
BORN
CHILD
CAN
BE
TRANSFERRED
TO
ANOTHER
PARTY
WHILE
THAT
OF
A
FETUS
CANNOT
A
BORN
CHILD
DOES
NOT
LIVE
WITHIN
THE
BODY
OF
ANOTHER
HUMAN
BEING
WHILE
A
FETUS
DOES
THEREBY
REPRESENTING
POTENTIAL
AND
OFTEN
ACTUAL
HARM
TO
THAT
BODY
AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
ONE
OF
OUR
TALKABORTION
PARTICIPANTS
WHO
SUFFERS
FROM
EPILEPSY
AND
TO
WHOM
PREGNANCY
REPRESENTS
A
SIGNIFICANT
HEALTH
RISK
OR
AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
A
WOMAN
I
KNOW
WHO
CHOSE
TO
CONTINUE
HER
PREGNANCY
BUT
SPENT
HER
ENTIRE
PREGNANCY
CONFINED
TO
A
WHEELCHAIR
AND
SUFFERING
GREAT
PAIN
FROM
CONSTRICTION
OF
SOME
NERVE
AND
YOUR
ARGUMENT
IS
NOT
AN
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
ABORTION
GENERALLY
BUT
AT
BEST
AN
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
ABORTION
AT
SOME
TIME
DURING
THE
COURSE
OF
PREGNANCY
AGAIN
A
QUEST
FOR
COMMON
GROUND
MOST
OF
THE
PROCHOICE
PEOPLE
I
HAVE
SPOKEN
TO
IN
PERSON
NONE
OF
THEM
PROABORTION
ACTIVISTS
CONCEDE
THAT
THE
CHILD
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
LIFE
AT
SOME
POINT
THAT
SUPERSEDES
ALL
OF
THE
MOTHERS
RIGHTS
EXCEPT
THAT
OF
HER
OWN
LIFE
AS
IS
OFTEN
THE
CASE
IN
EMOTIONALLY
CHARGED
ISSUES
THE
ACTIVISTS
HAVE
A
VERY
DIFFERENT
OUTLOOK
FROM
THE
MAINSTREAM
YOU
HAVENT
ANSWERED
THE
QUESTION
THE
SITUATIONS
ARE
NOT
ANALAGOUS
THE
DEPENDENCE
OF
A
BORN
CHILD
IS
NOT
TRANSFERRED
INSTANTANEOUSLY
IT
TAKES
TIME
AND
EFFORT
INCIDENTALLY
IT
IS
THE
PROCHOICE
SIDE
NOT
ME
ARGUING
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
MAKE
IT
EASY
FOR
PARENTS
TO
ABANDON
THEIR
CHILDREN
TO
THE
STATE
AGAIN
YOU
AVOID
THE
QUESTION
DEPENDENCE
CAN
BE
TRANSFERRED
AND
IT
IS
NOT
AS
SLOW
AS
YOU
SEEM
TO
THINK
AS
TO
THE
ANECDOTAL

OF
REAL
HUMAN
TRAGEDY
THERE
IS
AMPLE

I

THE

THAT
