steve
hendricks
writes
of
course
one
again
faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
without
having
a
complete
answer
to
this
question
i
should
think
it
obvious
that
the
first
step
should
be
to
convince
people
this
would
be
a
desirable
result
there
are
still
quite
a
lot
of
people
who
feel
that
the
command
economies
of
eastern
europe
failed
due
to
corruption
rather
than
essential
weaknesses
of
caommand
economies
and
you
still
have
a
majority
in
this
nation
that
favors
keeping
unenforced
and
unenforcible
laws
on
the
books
in
order
to
send
a
signal
it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
feel
this
way
in
the
first
place
constant
combat
isnt
particularly
conducive
to
intellectual
theorizing
also
they
tend
to
get
invaded
before
they
can
come
to
anything
like
a
stable
society
anyway
regulation
is
such
a
vauge
word
i
wouldnt
call
it
vague
id
call
it
elastic
all
regulation
is
not
necessarily
the
same
by
opposing
all
government
regulation
some
libertarians
treat
every
system
from
a
command
economy
to
those
that
regulate
relatively
free
markets
as
identical
thats
one
reason
many
of
the
rest
of
us
find
their
analysis
to
be
simplistic
umm
is
there
any
distinction
between
vague
and
elastic
in
this
context
aside
from
one
having
a
more
positive
connotation
than
the
other
at
any
rate
weve
been
through
all
this
before
