re
the
role
of
the
national
news
media
in
inflaming
passions
in
article
greg
hennessy
writes
clayton
cramer
but
what
came
out
in
much
lower
profile
reporting
was
that
the
victim
was
a
prostitute
and
the
man
had
not
paid
her
hence
the
false
accusation
there
was
no
evidence
the
woman
in
question
was
a
prostitute
the
defense
merely
alledged
that
she
was
the
fact
that
she
was
wearing
a
miniskirt
with
no
underwear
was
presented
as
evidence
that
she
was
a
prostitute
and
the
court
apparently
found
this
compelling
even
clayton
knows
the
difference
err
perhaps
clayton
doesnt
know
the
difference
clayton
does
indeed
know
the
difference
greg
apparently
doesnt
the
judge
found
that
there
was
some
credible
evidence
that
the
marines
were
engaged
in
selfdefense
no
the
judge
found
that
the
prosecution
did
not
carry
out
the
burder
on
proof
because
the
judge
found
that
there
was
some
credible
evidence
that
the
marines
were
engaged
in
selfdefense
got
it
knucklehead
a
small
clipping
from
clarinews
under
fair
use
guidelines
new
hanover
district
court
judge
jacqueline
morrisgoodson
ruled
in
the
benchtrial
that
the
state
failed
to
carry
its
burden
in
proving
the
marines
acted
to
cause
injury
because
in
part
repeat
after
me
the
judge
found
that
there
was
some
credible
evidence
that
the
marines
were
engaged
in
selfdefense
hopefully
one
of
these
days
you
will
understand
interesting
that
in
of
the
cases
clayton
does
what
he
accuses
others
of
doing
with
respect
to
credibility
i
would
rate
clayton
cramer
an
order
of
magnitude
higher
than
a
the
news
media
and
b
homosexuals
but
i
never
thought
clayton
was
consistent
clayton
is
indeed
consistent
and
so
are
you
the
views
expressed
herein
are
theodore
a
kaldis
my
own
only
do
you
seriously
kaldisremusrutgersedu
believe
that
a
major
university
rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
as
this
would
hold
such
views
