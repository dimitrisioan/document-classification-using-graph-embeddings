CRITISISM
IS
TOO
EASY
WHAT
SOLUTIONS
DO
PEOPLE
HAVE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BETTER
THAN
WHAT
THE
FBI
HAD
BEEN
DOING
FOR
THE
LAST
FEW
MONTHS
FIRSTLY
THEY
COULD
HAVE
BACKED
OFF
WHEN
YOU
PUT
A
POWER
FREAK
LIKE
DAVID
KORESH
IN
THAT
KIND
OF
SITUATION
HE
IS
GOING
TO
EXPLODE
NO
PUN
INTENDED
KORESH
WANTED
TO
BE
A
MARTYR
AND
THE
GOVERNMENT
PLAYED
RIGHT
INTO
HIS
HANDS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
HADNT
GIVEN
HIM
THE
ATTENTION
HE
WANTED
NOTHING
WOULD
HAVE
EVER
HAPPENED
SECONDLY
THE
DAVIDIANS
WERE
EXPECTING
EVERYTHING
THE
GOVERNMENT
DID
THEY
THOUGHT
THAT
THEY
WERE
FACING
THE
APOCALYPSE
AND
THAT
THEY
WERE
TO
PERISH
IN
FIRE
THEY
WERENT
SCARED
OF
THE
FBI
THEY
ARE
NOT
THE
AVERAGE
HOODS
THEY
ARE
VERY
DEVOUT
FOLLOWERS
OF
A
RELIGION
PSYOPS
DIDNT
WORK
AND
THE
GOVERNMENT
GOT
FRUSTRATED
SO
THEY
MURDERED
THEM
THE
BATF
SHOULD
HAVE
LEFT
AT
THE
BEGINNING
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
KORESHS
PERSONALITY
INSTEAD
THEY
THOUGHT
THEY
HAVE
GUNS
WE
HAVE
BIGGER
GUNS
LETS
GO
GET
EM
THEY
BOTCHED
IT
FROM
DAY
ONE
THEY
SHOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
THERE
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THE
ABOVE
CONVENIENTLY
IGNORES
THE
MURDER
OF
FOUR
BATF
AGENTS
BY
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
IN
AN
UNPROVOKED
AMBUSH
THE
ABOVE
STATEMENT
IGNORES
REALITY
THE
BD
WERE
PROVOKED
ANY
GOVERNMENT
THAT
ALLOWS
TINPOT
DICTATORS
TO
SET
UP
SHOP
AND
DECLARE
A
PRIVATE
STATE
HAS
DRIFTED
INTO
ANARCHY
THERE
ARE
LAWS
TO
CONTROL
THE
OWNERSHIP
OF
GUNS
AND
THE
BATF
HAD
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELEIVE
THAT
THEY
WERE
BEING
VIOLATED
THEY
SET
OUT
TO
OBTAIN
A
LEGAL
WARRANT
AND
ATTEMPTED
TO
SERVE
IT
ONLY
TO
BE
MET
WITH
GUNFIRE
WHEN
THEY
RANG
THE
DOORBELL
DAMN
PHIL
YOU
MUST
HAVE
SEEN
A
DIFFERENT
TAPE
OF
THE
INITIAL
RAID
THAN
I
DID
YOUR
DOORBELL
HAPPENED
TO
INCLUDE
LOBBING
PERCUSSION
GRENADES
AND
ATTEMPTING
TO
STORM
THE
COMPOUND
THROUGH
THE
WINDOWS
I
CAN
HONESTLY
SAY
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
DOORBELL
THAT
WORKS
LIKE
THAT
THE
PARANOID
ASSERTION
THAT
THE
BATF
FIRED
FIRST
IN
AN
UNPROVOKED
ASSAULT
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
BATF
WERE
ON
A
DEATH
WISH
HAD
THEY
EXPECTED
THE
BD
TO
BE
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
PEACEFULL
CITIZENS
WHO
WOULD
ACCEPT
A
SEARCH
AUTHORIZED
BY
A
COURT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TURNED
UP
IN
A
TANK
AND
BROKEN
THE
DOOR
DOWN
ON
DAY
ONE
THINK
MAN
THE
BATF
ARE
SERVING
A
WARRANT
ON
SOMEONE
WHO
THEY
FEEL
MIGHT
HAVE
ILLEGAL
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
IF
THEY
EXPECTED
AS
YOU
STATE
THAT
THE
BD
TO
BE
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
PEACEFUL
CITIZENS
THEY
COULD
HAVE
SENT
ONE
MAYBE
TWO
AGENTS
UP
TO
THE
FRONT
DOOR
KNOCK
AND
ATTEMPT
TO
SERVE
THE
WARRANT
ON
THE
PERSON
ANSWERING
THE
DOOR
SCENARIO
ONE
THAT
PERSON
LETS
THEM
IN
TO
PERFORM
THE
SEARCH
AND
NO
ONE
GETS
HURT
SCENARIO
TWO
THE
PERSON
ANSWERING
THE
DOOR
PULLS
A
WEAPON
AAND
KILLS
BOTH
OFFICERS
NOW
YOU
HAVE
TWO
DEAD
BATF
AGENTS
INSTEAD
OF
FOUR
THE
BATF
KNOWS
EXACTLY
WHERE
THEY
STAND
WITH
REGARDS
TO
THE
BD
AND
BEGAN
TO
FORMULATE
A
PLAN
OF
ACTION
TO
ARREST
THOSE
RESPONSIBLE
WITHOUT
HARM
TO
THE
INNOCENT
PEOPLECHILDREN
WITHIN
THE
COMPOUND
THE
STUPIDITY
WAS
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
SERVE
A
WARANT
ON
THE
PLACE
BY
LUDICROUSLY
UNDERARMED
AND
UNPROTECTED
POLICE
NO
THE
STUPIDITY
WAS
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
SERVE
THE
WARRANT
SWAT
STYLE
IF
ANYONE
ON
THE
NET
CARES
TO
SUGGEST
A
SURE
FIRE
METHOD
OF
BRINGING
THE
MURDERES
OF
FOUR
POLICE
OFFICERS
TO
JUSTICE
PERHAPS
WE
COULD
HEAR
IT
SURE
DO
IT
WITHIN
THE
LAW
THE
BATF
IS
THERE
TO
UPHOLD
THE
LAW
NOT
CIRCUMVENT
IT
TO
FIT
THEIR
NEEDS
