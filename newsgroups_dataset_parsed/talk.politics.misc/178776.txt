AS
FAR
AS
SET
THE
MORAL
TONE
IS
CONCERNED
IF
A
COMMUNITY
DOES
NOT
COLLECTIVELY
WANT
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
PROSTITUTION
GOING
ON
IN
FRONT
OF
THEIR
KIDS
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
HAVE
TO
IF
A
COMMUNITY
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
SEE
PROLIFERATION
OF
DRUGS
AMONG
THEIR
KIDS
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
HAVE
TO
BY
WHAT
RIGHT
AND
DO
TELL
FROM
THE
STANDPOINT
OF
THE
DRUG
DEALER
OR
PROSTITUTE
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
IF
THE
GUN
IS
POINTED
BY
THE
LOCAL
HICK
CITY
COUNCIL
OR
THE
FEDS
IF
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
IT
IS
WRONG
PERIOD
IF
IT
IS
NOT
SUSTAINABLE
AT
A
FEDERAL
LEVEL
WHY
SHOULD
IT
BE
OK
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
GEOGRAPHICAL
UNIT
IS
SMALLER
PETER
NELSON
POSTED
A
VERY
ELOQUENT
RESPONSE
TO
THIS
POINT
IN
TALKPOLITICSMISC
SO
I
NEED
NOT
CONSUME
MORE
BANDWIDTH
HERE
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
EGALITARIAN
VIEW
IS
THAT
IT
TRIES
TO
DENY
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
DILEMMA
OF
DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
EXERCISE
A
VOICE
IN
THEIR
COMMUNITY
YET
INDIVIDUALS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
BE
LEFT
TO
THEMSELVES
THIS
IS
A
SERIOUS
DILEMMA
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NOT
MUCH
THAT
TAKES
PLACE
IN
A
VACUUM
YOU
ARE
SERIOUSLY
MISUSING
THE
WORD
EGALITARIAN
YOU
SHOULD
LOOK
THE
WORD
UP
BEFORE
YOU
USE
IT
THERE
IS
A
VAST
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
EQUAL
JUSTICE
UNDER
THE
LAW
AND
EGALITARIANISM
WHAT
I
MEANT
IF
IT
WAS
NOT
CLEAR
WAS
THE
INTERSECTION
SET
OF
LIBERAL
AND
LIBERTARIAN
PHILOSOPHIES
OF
NATURAL
RIGHTS
AND
HOW
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
CONSTITUTIONAL
INTERPRETATION
IN
PARTICULAR
FITS
INTO
THAT
PHILOSOPHY
THIS
PHILOSOPHY
ENGAGES
IN
THE
VERY
SERIOUS
PRACTICAL
ERROR
OF
ENDOWING
THE
NINE
LAWYERS
ON
THE
SUPREME
COURT
WITH
AN
ALMOST
TOTALITARIAN
AUTHORITY
COMPLETELY
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
CONSENT
OR
CONSENSUS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THIS
IS
WHY
SUPREME
COURT
NOMINATIONS
ARE
SUCH
AMAZING
POLITICAL
FISTFIGHTS
THESE
DAYS
BECAUSE
HE
WHO
CONTROLS
THE
COURT
RULES
THE
COUNTRY
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
COURT
MAY
WELL
BE
TRYING
TO
DO
THE
BEST
JOB
THEY
CAN
BUT
THEY
ARE
AT
BEST
A
BENEVOLENT
OLIGARCH
EVEN
IF
YOU
APPROVE
OF
EVERY
SUPREME
COURT
DECISION
EVER
EVENTUALLY
AN
OLIGARCH
WILL
ARISE
THAT
WILL
DECIMATE
THAT
WHICH
YOU
HOLD
DEAR
TRY
SUPREME
COURT
CASES
BY
JURY
AND
THE
PROBLEM
WOULD
BE
MITIGATED
A
GREAT
DEAL
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
CREATE
BROAD
NONENUMERATED
GOVERNMENT
POWERS
AT
ANY
LEVEL
AS
IN
EUROPEAN
PARLAMENTARY
DEMOCRACIES
AND
THE
CURRENT
DEFACTO
STANDARD
IN
THE
US
HAVE
ESSENTIALLY
ENGAGED
IN
THE
SAME
FUNDAMENTAL
MISTAKE
EXCEPT
THAT
IT
IS
SOME
DIFFERENT
BODY
THAT
HAS
THE
TOTALITARIAN
VIRTUALLY
UNCHECKED
EXCEPT
BY
PLURALITY
ELECTION
DEATH
OR
RETIREMENT
GOVERNMENT
POWER
AND
WHY
SHOULD
YOUR
COMMUNITY
BE
ALLOWED
TO
STOP
MY
ACTIVITIES
WHEN
IM
NOT
PICKING
YOUR
POCKET
OR
DEFRAUDING
YOU
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
LIKE
IT
BECAUSE
YOU
FIND
IT
MORALLY
REPUGNANT
THIS
IS
LIKE
ASKING
WHY
THE
WIND
BLOWS
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
PROVE
THAT
THE
FACT
OF
YOUR
ENGAGING
IN
CERTAIN
ACTIVITIES
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
EFFECT
WHATSOEVER
ON
ANY
OTHER
HUMAN
BEING
WHO
HAS
NOT
CONSENTED
TO
YOUR
ENGAGEMENT
IN
THOSE
ACTIVITIES
VERY
FEW
HUMAN
ACTIVITIES
INDEED
FIT
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
EVEN
FOR
THOSE
FEW
THAT
DO
WHO
WOULD
YOU
EMPOWER
TO
MAKE
THE
JUDGEMENT
OF
WHAT
IS
AND
IS
NOT
A
FULLY
AUTONOMOUS
ACTIVITY
WHO
DEFINES
PICKING
MY
POCKET
AND
DEFRAUDING
ARE
ECONOMIC
ASSETS
A
PERSONS
ONLY
ASSETS
OR
ARE
PEACE
OF
MIND
STABILITY
CONFIDENCE
IN
A
CHILDS
EMOTIONAL
ENVIRONMENT
SECURITY
AND
MANY
OTHER
THINGS
NOT
ALSO
A
PART
OF
A
PERSONS
ASSETS
WHAT
GIVES
YOU
THE
RIGHT
TO
CREATE
A
MORAL
ENVIRONMENT
THAT
A
PARENT
STRONGLY
OBJECTS
TO
WHAT
GIVES
YOU
THE
RIGHT
TO
CREATE
AN
ENVIRONMENT
OF
SOCIAL
UNREST
AND
INSTABILITY
IF
YOU
SAY
THAT
WHAT
YOU
DO
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THOSE
EFFECTS
BY
WHAT
AUTHORITY
DO
YOU
SAY
THAT
WHO
IS
EMPOWERED
TO
MAKE
THESE
VALUE
JUDGEMENTS
HOW
WOULD
YOU
FEEL
IF
I
GOT
A
GANG
TOGETHER
AND
FOUND
XTIANITY
OR
INSERT
YOUR
FAVORITE
CAUSE
HERE
MORALLY
REPUGNANT
AND
PASSED
LAWS
TO
OUTLAW
ITS
FREE
EXERCISE
ALL
AT
A
LOCAL
LEVEL
SINCE
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
AOK
WITH
YOU
IF
THE
FEDERAL
CONSTITUTION
EXPLICITLY
PROHIBITED
YOU
FROM
DOING
SO
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
WOULD
PREVENT
YOU
FROM
DOING
SO
IF
IT
DID
NOT
AND
YOU
COULD
MUSTER
ENOUGH
LOCAL
SUPPORT
TO
PASS
AN
AMENDMENT
TO
THE
LOCAL
CONSTITUTION
BY
SAY
A
MAJORITY
EMPOWERING
THE
LOCAL
GOVERNMENT
TO
DO
SO
THEN
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
VOTE
WITH
MY
FEET
AND
MOVE
TO
A
NEIGHBORHOOD
MORE
FRIENDLY
TO
MY
OWN
SYSTEM
OF
VALUES
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
IDEAL
SITUATION
BUT
IT
IS
FAR
BETTER
THAN
THE
MESS
WE
ARE
MIRED
IN
RIGHT
NOW
AS
TO
THE
GANG
OF
PITCHFORK
AND
TORCH
WIELDING
FRIENDS
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
RESTRICTIVE
LOCAL
LAWS
THAT
I
PERSONALLY
WOULD
ADVOCATE
OR
VOTE
FOR
SINCE
I
AM
OF
THE
VIEW
THAT
EXERCISING
GOVERNMENT
POWER
OVER
YOUR
NEIGHBORS
SHOULD
BE
DONE
WITH
EXTREME
CARE
AND
ONLY
WHEN
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
BUT
I
DO
BELIEVE
IN
PROTECTING
CHILDREN
FROM
VICTIMIZATION
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
CALLOUS
DISREGARD
FOR
THE
EFFECTS
THEY
HAVE
ON
OTHERS
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
LEAVE
A
WELLBEHAVED
MASSAGE
PARLOR
ALONE
SO
LONG
AS
IT
HAD
NO
DETRIMENTAL
EFFECTS
ON
THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
YOU
JUST
DONT
GET
IT
THE
DEBATE
IS
NOT
WHETHER
YOU
OR
A
COMMUNITITY
WOULD
OR
WOULD
NOT
VOTE
AWAY
MY
RIGHTS
IT
IS
THE
PROPRIETY
OF
WHETHER
THAT
SHOULD
EVEN
BE
AN
OPTION
WHEN
YOU
DEFINE
RIGHTS
VERY
BROADLY
THERE
IS
NO
PRACTICAL
CHOICE
ABOUT
WHETHER
PEOPLE
WILL
OR
WILL
NOT
INFRINGE
UPON
YOUR
RIGHTS
SINCE
THESE
RIGHTS
OVERLAP
EVEN
WHEN
RIGHTS
ARE
DEFINED
VERY
NARROWLY
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
BEEN
EMPOWERED
TO
PREVENT
OTHERS
FROM
INFRINGING
ON
YOUR
RIGHTS
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
QUESTION
IS
BY
WHOSE
AUTHORITY
IS
THAT
POWER
CREATED
IF
YOU
SUPPORT
THE
CURRENT
SITUATION
WITH
A
NATURAL
RIGHTS
SUPREME
COURT
RATHER
THAN
AN
ORIGINAL
UNDERSTANDING
SUPREME
COURT
OR
EVEN
BETTER
SUPREME
COURT
BY
JURY
YOU
ARE
CONSENTING
TO
HAVING
NINE
LAWYERS
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
CREATE
THOSE
POWERS
OUT
OF
THE
AIR
IN
MY
FRACTAL
FEDERALISM
SCENARIO
IT
IS
A
BROAD
CONSENSUS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IE
THE
AMENDMENT
PROCESS
THAT
CREATES
THOSE
POWERS
CERTAINLY
NOT
THE
ONLY
CAUSE
MIKE
BUT
PEOPLE
IN
A
LOCAL
NEIGHBORHOOD
SHOULD
HAVE
A
VOICE
IN
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD
TO
DENY
THIS
IS
TO
CREATE
ANOTHER
CONCENTRATED
CENTRALIZED
POWER
TO
KEEP
THE
LOCALITY
FROM
ABUSING
ITS
POWER
YOU
MEAN
THAT
HORRIFIC
CENTRALIZED
POWER
THE
INDIVIDUAL
NO
I
MEAN
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
THAT
COMES
TRUCKING
IN
WITH
GUNS
TO
TELL
THE
LOCALS
HOW
TO
RUN
THEIR
NEIGHBORHOOD
WACO
TX
IS
A
NICE
EXAMPLE
IN
ESSENCE
USING
A
PIT
BULL
TO
KEEP
A
TOY
POODLE
FROM
BITING
YOUR
LEG
CHANCES
ARE
THE
PIT
BULL
IS
GOING
TO
TURN
ON
YOU
SOME
DAY
AND
YOU
HAVE
MUCH
LESS
DEFENSE
AGAINST
IT
THAN
YOU
DO
AGAINST
THE
TOY
POODLE
IDEALLY
EVERYONE
WOULD
LEAVE
EVERYONE
ELSE
ALONE
AND
NO
GOVERNMENT
COERCIVE
POWER
OF
ANY
KIND
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
THIS
WILL
NEVER
WORK
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
ARE
DIFFERENT
AND
BY
THEIR
NATURE
THEY
WILL
ALWAYS
WANT
TO
FORCE
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
OTHERS
IF
THIS
WERE
NOT
THE
CASE
NOBODY
WOULD
TRY
TO
FORCE
THEIR
VIEW
THAT
MURDER
IS
WRONG
ON
ANYONE
ELSE
FINE
WHEN
THEY
FORCE
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
OTHERS
PROSECUTE
THEM
UNTIL
THEN
LEAVE
THEM
ALONE
THIS
IS
SUCH
A
SIMPLE
CONCEPT
HOW
DO
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
SPEECH
CODES
HATE
SPEECH
CERTAINLY
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
AN
INDICATION
THAT
THE
PIT
BULL
IS
GOING
TO
TURN
SOME
DAY
SHOULD
THE
COMMUNITY
BE
ALLOWED
TO
LIMIT
IT
TOO
IF
NOT
WHY
NOT
IF
YOU
CREATE
A
COMMUNITY
WHERE
PUBLIC
MASTURBATION
IS
PERMITTED
IN
THE
CAUSE
OF
PERSONAL
AUTONOMY
HAVE
YOU
DONE
ANYTHING
DIFFERENT
WHAT
PRECISELY
ARE
THESE
AUTONOMOUS
ACTIVITIES
YOU
ARE
REFERRING
TO
IF
YOU
LIST
THEM
PERHAPS
WE
CAN
GET
ENOUGH
PEOPLE
TO
AGREE
THAT
THEY
ARE
TRULY
AUTONOMOUS
AND
PASS
A
CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT
PROTECTING
THEM
AND
HOW
DO
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
DAVID
KORESH
DID
HE
DESERVE
IT
SHOULD
THE
BATF
OR
A
LOCAL
VERSION
OF
SAME
BE
ALLOWED
TO
TOSS
HIM
IN
JAIL
JUST
BECAUSE
THEY
THINK
HES
OFF
HIS
ROCKER
THE
KORESH
INCIDENT
APPEARS
TO
BE
A
HORRENDOUS
ABUSE
OF
GOVERNMENT
POWER
POWER
POSSIBLY
ILLEGITIMATELY
OBTAINED
THROUGH
A
MEANS
I
WOULD
ABOLISH
THE
CONSTITUTIONALITY
OF
NOKNOCK
WARRANTS
SEEMS
VERY
DUBIOUS
TO
ME
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
MERE
EXISTENCE
OF
BATF
AND
THE
GOVERNMENTS
PROPENSITY
TO
IGNORE
THE
WORD
INFRINGE
IN
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
THIS
POWER
IS
UPHELD
BY
THE
SAME
BODY
WITH
ITS
INCREDIBLE
CONCENTRATION
OF
POWER
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
NINE
PEOPLE
THAT
HAS
UPHELD
MUCH
SOCALLED
CIVIL
RIGHTS
READ
AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION
LEGISLATION
DESPITE
THE
FOURTEENTH
AMENDMENT
WHO
SAID
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
PUBLIC
TILL
GET
RID
OF
IT
AND
GET
OUT
OF
MY
FACE
I
AGREE
ABOUT
GETTING
RID
OF
THE
PUBLIC
TILL
ARE
YOU
STILL
SURE
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
COME
OVER
FOR
COFFEE
YOU
MIGHT
NOT
ESPECIALLY
LIKE
MY
NEIGHBORHOOD
AND
I
MIGHT
NOT
ESPECIALLY
LIKE
YOURS
BUT
AT
LEAST
WE
CAN
AGREE
TO
LET
EACH
OTHER
LIVE
THE
KIND
OF
LIFE
WE
WANT
TO
AT
THE
POINT
YOU
GET
RID
OF
THE
PUBLIC
TILL
YOU
LOSE
ALL
CREDIBILITY
AS
TO
WHY
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
A
SAY
ABOUT
MY
PRIVATE
AFFAIRS
ARE
YOU
SURE
YOU
ARE
READY
FOR
THAT
MONEY
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
THE

ASSET
I
