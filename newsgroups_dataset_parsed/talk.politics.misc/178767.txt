the
point
is
though
that
you
learn
through
mistakes
the
govt
played
the
wrong
card
and
lost
thats
not
a
big
deal
they
had
had
four
guys
murdered
at
the
begining
and
maybee
they
just
were
not
prepared
for
wuite
this
situation
who
could
be
if
the
same
thing
were
to
happen
all
over
again
we
might
perhaps
be
able
to
castigate
the
govt
if
they
used
the
same
tactics
and
failed
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
i
cant
say
that
i
would
not
have
made
the
same
mistake
maybee
i
wouldnt
because
i
dont
as
a
rule
go
in
for
a
confrontational
situation
if
i
can
avoid
it
maybee
i
would
because
with
all
those
press
about
its
very
difficult
not
to
try
the
macho
stuff
my
god
how
many
chances
do
they
get

etc
hell
we
get
heavily
armed
millenial
cults
out
west
every
couple
of
years
do
with
have
to
start
a
cascade
of
times
the

have
been
