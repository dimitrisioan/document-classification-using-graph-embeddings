im
saying
any
long
term
investor
the
ones
likely
to
have
large
capital
gains
would
be
foolish
to
sell
in
order
to
avoid
a
tax
hike
that
a
might
disappear
in
any
given
year
and
b
be
overcome
in
a
year
or
two
by
accumlated
gains
to
which
my
response
isso
what
not
all
people
who
pay
capital
gains
taxes
are
long
term
investors
more
than
enough
of
them
arent
for
there
to
be
huge
blip
whenever
capital
gains
taxes
get
raised
i
never
said
that
everyone
would
find
this
advantageous
i
said
that
more
than
enough
would
for
the
result
to
be
readily
noticeable
and
distort
trends
even
if
bretts
eventualreturn
figures
were
correct
and
they
clearly
werent
hed
still
be
wrong
about
the
cause
for
the
blip
because
he
fails
to
consider
basic
factors
you
misunderstand
im
not
trying
to
prove
a
cause
for
anything
merely
pointing
out
that
teds
assertion
that
the
blip
in
revenues
was
caused
by
selling
to
avoid
the
tax
cant
be
proven
as
ted
notes
not
everyone
is
a
longterm
investor
one
might
find
oneself
as
i
did
in
late
anticipating
expenses
in
the
near
term
that
require
selling
off
holdings
given
the
choice
between
waiting
a
few
weeks
and
taking
an
extra
tax
hit
or
selling
in
december
with
preferential
tax
treatment
only
a
fool
would
choose
the
former
not
disputed
the
fact
that
brett
can
now
construct
post
hoc
calculations
of
what
would
have
been
more
beneficial
to
investors
is
in
many
respects
beside
the
point
there
was
plenty
of
moneystyle
advice
given
to
unsophisticated
investors
in
late
to
sell
now
and
save
on
taxes
in
case
anyone
missed
it
there
was
no
shortage
of
similar
advice
late
last
year
in
the
nytimes
eg
even
though
that
advice
was
based
not
on
the
foregone
conclusion
of
enacted
law
as
in
but
merely
on
the
assumption
that
clinton
would
raise
tax
rates
without
capping
cg
taxes
contrary
to
the
current
proposal
it
works
for
any
situation
if
you
believe
the
market
is
going
up
dont
sell
if
believe
its
not
sell
but
then
youd
be
selling
anyways
wouldnt
you
so
where
is
the
evidence
that
a
large
number
of
people
suddenly
decided
that
the
higher
taxes
meant
they
should
sell
before
the
year
was
out
there
isnt
any
teds
saying
that
the
increase
over
the
previous
year
is
proof
of
that
proposition
but
im
saying
you
cant
know
that
the
trend
of
increasing
capital
gains
revenues
wouldnt
account
for
a
lot
of
that
increase
was
the
height
of
the
housing
boom
remember
people
were
trading
up
like
mad
its
nice
to
think
that
investors
always
behave
in
their
optimal
economic
interest
like
assuming
weightless
ropes
and
frictionless
pulleys
though
this
sort
of
thinking
often
fails
to
describe
accurately
what
happens
in
the
real
world
indeed
brett
theres
nothing
so
passionate
as
a
vested
interest
disguised
as
an
intellectual
conviction
