quote
from
rushs
radio
show
yesterday
when
he
referred
to
recent
events
near
waco
texas
me
either
yes
its
regrettable
that
eightysomeodd
people
died
but
they
could
have
walked
out
the
door
with
the
simple
turn
of
a
knob
its
just
plain
stupid
to
lay
the
blame
for
this
at
anyones
feet
but
ol
vernons
if
the
fbibatf
started
the
fire
why
did
it
take
six
or
so
hours
to
catch
timed
incendiary
devices
you
say
could
those
idiots
not
have
picked
them
up
and
tossed
them
out
the
window
and
what
of
this
argument
about
whether
a
wood
burning
stove
was
being
used
its
a
known
fact
that
when
a
city
is
under
seige
the
citzens
thereof
eat
what
they
can
how
they
can
hell
the
bds
couldve
had
mre
type
grub
for
all
any
of
us
know
my
conscience
is
clear
does
the
word
smolder
mean
anything
to
you
several
minutes
can
go
by
before
a
smoldering
cigarette
butt
in
a
couch
sets
the
couch
on
fire
heres
a
possible
maybe
very
possible
scenario
one
of
the
cs
gas
grenades
that
the
fbi
threw
in
earlier
caused
some
material
like
the
drapes
or
carpet
to
smolder
for
an
extended
period
of
time
later
on
when
a
tank
punched
a
hole
in
the
wall
knocking
over
one
of
the
bds
kerosene
lanterns
kerosene
spilled
onto
this
smoldering
material
resulting
in
a
fire
that
killed
people
inside
another
possibility
and
this
results
in
a
fire
that
starts
in
one
room
and
torches
the
entire
place
before
anyone
in
the
adjacent
rooms
can
escape
i
dont
think
so
so
much
for
the
smolder
theory
donavan
sorry
no
catchy
quotes
