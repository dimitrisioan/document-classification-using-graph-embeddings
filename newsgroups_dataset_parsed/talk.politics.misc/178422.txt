if
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
house
of
representatives
was
also
in
fact
they
both
were
because
the
british
government
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
in
principle
no
in
practice
yes
in
principle
no
that
they
had
less
power
of
that
they
should
have
had
less
power
the
british
parliament
in
principle
has
absolute
power
so
does
the
monarch
much
of
the
stability
of
the
system
rests
on
what
is
not
defined
clearly
in
the
case
of
a
clear
abuse
by
one
side
or
the
other
the
other
side
can
act
to
remedy
the
situation
two
institutions
with
absolute
power
cute
lets
talk
practicality
shall
we
if
the
monarch
tried
to
do
something
what
would
happen
if
they
were
to
start
from
a
social
welfare
model
instead
of
the
current
no
state
subsidy
motto
they
would
be
better
placed
as
it
is
there
is
plenty
of
state
money
being
handed
out
the
problem
is
that
it
is
distributed
on
the
basis
of
power
in
congress
and
not
on
the
basis
of
actual
need
bingo
the
higher
up
the
governmental
ladder
the
less
actual
need
matters
because
political
power
can
be
concentrated
at
higher
levels
while
people
with
less
cloud
only
find
themselves
reduced
to
in
effectiveness
that
was
not
my
point
but
you
illustrated
the
problem
very
well
in
order
to
set
up
a
school
project
in
new
york
state
you
have
to
pay
off
the
other
states
with
pork
defense
contracts
agricultural
subsidies
etc
or
to
be
precise
of
the
states
since
you
need
to
beat
the
filibuster
then
why
not
simply
leave
new
yorks
education
to
new
york
i
remain
unconcinved
that
there
is
any
state
in
the
union
which
is
not
capable
of
educating
its
own
children
if
thats
what
they
want
to
do
the
point
is
of
redistribution
of
cash
from
the
poor
areas
of
the
ecconomy
to
the
rich
ones
i
am
contending
that
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
which
does
not
have
ample
wealth
if
they
choose
to
spend
it
to
run
a
perfectly
acceptable
education
system
i
further
contend
that
the
amount
of
money
being
spent
now
is
more
then
sufficient
but
is
being
spent
badly
or
vice
versa
if
you
arent
a
republican
so
tell
me
phill
were
the
republicans
also
responsible
for
some
of
the
huge
increases
in
social
programs
or
were
they
only
responsible
for
what
you
dont
like
i
contend
it
is
congress
which
is
to
blame
democrat
and
republican
alike
if
society
simply
writes
off
any
areas
of
the
country
that
is
ecconomically
weak
you
end
up
with
a
basket
case
ecconomy
there
are
inevitable
cycles
in
any
business
some
of
these
act
in
phase
to
produce
the
business
cycle
others
are
countercyclic
localities
can
experience
boom
to
bust
cycles
outside
the
national
trend
to
produce
a
strong
ecconomy
you
need
to
ensure
that
the
bust
areas
do
not
fall
bellow
the
level
where
they
cannot
be
ecconomically
rebuilt
most
of
our
worst
areas
are
still
better
off
than
most
of
europe
in
any
case
were
talking
about
education
if
the
industry
in
an
area
collapses
the
us
as
a
whole
still
has
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
children
in
that
area
get
a
good
education
in
some
areas
of
the
us
schools
are
closing
halfway
through
the
year
for
lack
of
money
yes
i
live
in
once
such
area
youre
woefully
ignorant
of
the
situation
at
the
same
time
some
of
tennessees
school
districts
are
closing
down
the
governor
asked
for
million
dollars
for
bicentenntial
celebration
license
plats
in
almost
the
same
breath
he
wanted
to
raise
unemployment
compensation
and
reduce
taxes
which
paid
into
it
i
dont
know
about
the
rest
of
the
country
but
our
education
problems
stem
directly
from
two
problems
neither
of
which
are
a
lack
of
money
in
the
state
btw
tennessee
is
considered
a
tax
heaven
and
our
economy
is
one
of
the
strongest
in
the
country
i
see
a
correlation
what
money
we
spend
goes
primarly
to
administration
the
average
administrator
makes
two
and
a
half
times
what
the
average
teacher
makes
and
sucks
up
an
enormous
amount
of
revenue
and
the
governor
is
making
a
concerted
effort
to
create
an
education
crisis
in
order
to
push
for
his
pet
income
tax
some
of
the
most
idiotic
programs
get
funded
like
state
funds
for
new
art
in
the
county
seat
while
schools
are
closing
its
not
a
lack
of
funds
its
an
unwillingness
to
spend
them
on
what
is
more
appropriate
education
is
the
parental
hotbutton
education
is
always
the
first
to
but
cut
because
its
easier
to
get
people
to
pay
for
their
children
than
ugly
art
the
us
constitution
is
a
nutsandbolts
document
the
delcaration
of
independence
was
the
highbrow
reasoning
there
are
a
couple
of
other
examples
though
such
as
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
tax
and
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
grant
permits
both
in
article
i
section
the
declaration
on
independence
cam
a
decade
earlier
and
has
not
a
line
of
justification
for
the
us
constitution
you
could
argue
that
it
went
into
the
broad
concepts
but
little
more
it
spoke
very
eloquently
on
government
being
based
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
in
fact
it
is
little
more
than
a
protracted
whinge
more
to
do
with
the
price
of
tea
than
the
design
of
a
government
it
would
be
a
pretty
daft
idea
for
a
bunch
of
guys
to
sit
arround
designing
the
structure
of
the
new
government
while
the
little
matter
of
the
british
army
remained
to
be
settled
they
did
it
anyway
the
continental
congress
had
its
own
set
of
bylaws
it
wasnt
quite
a
government
but
a
means
of
making
decisions
had
to
be
created
however
low
george
washingtons
opinion
of
them
were
to
a
certain
extend
i
do
believe
the
veto
has
become
something
it
wasnt
intended
however
i
also
believe
it
is
inevitable
considering
the
congress
own
abuse
of
their
power
to
make
bills
say
whatever
they
want
them
to
say
unlike
most
people
i
think
we
shouldnt
be
worrying
about
the
veto
which
is
fine
but
of
the
problem
in
congress
which
almost
necessitates
its
abuse
the
congress
is
the
most
democratic
body
in
the
whole
system
allow
me
again
to
speak
heresy
against
the
holy
democratic
orders
so
what
the
government
was
built
with
a
very
nondemocratic
presidency
with
fairly
broad
powers
including
the
veto
it
has
not
only
the
fairest
system
of
election
but
the
two
year
term
means
that
the
members
have
always
got
a
recent
mandate
yes
and
the
senate
was
intended
to
act
as
a
balance
to
this
too
much
democracy
was
intentionally
avoided
it
was
considered
a
good
thing
to
place
nondemocratic
blocks
to
impulsive
action
on
the
other
hand
if
the
period
of
election
were
to
be
made
years
in
antiphase
to
the
presidential
cycle
there
would
be
much
less
dependence
on
fund
raising
from
special
interests
than
there
is
at
present
so
long
as
congress
has
something
to
sell
people
will
pay
for
it
most
congressmen
rake
in
more
money
than
they
need
why
not
what
is
inherently
wrong
with
biasing
the
system
against
action
historically
governemnt
action
in
the
us
when
dealing
with
issues
with
a
bare
minority
and
a
large
minority
have
not
been
successful
when
youre
in
a
position
of
imposing
federal
power
on
diverse
people
why
should
the
federal
government
not
have
to
got
through
something
more
than
a
bare
majority
in
other
words
david
thinks
that
the
reactionaries
should
need
only
votes
while
progressives
should
need
no
if
the
progressives
dont
want
the
reactionaries
to
move
backward
they
get
the
same
benefit
of
the
states
is
a
lot
of
people
and
historically
laws
with
that
sort
of
minority
arent
very
effective
especially
since
it
is
usually
geographically
concentrated
when
wielding
the
federal
big
stick
i
dont
see
why
they
shouldnt
have
to
make
a
better
argument
than
more
people
than
not
agree
now
we
know
why
nobody
calls
the
republicans
democrats
im
not
a
republican
im
a
republican
and
no
im
neither
a
democrat
nor
a
democrat
now
ive
asked
several
times
and
all
youve
done
is
answer
it
isnt
democratic
which
i
knew
before
i
said
it
why
should
it
be
democratic
we
dont
have
a
true
direct
democracy
and
few
people
advocate
one
why
then
is
this
other
modification
of
democracy
to
bias
it
against
action
so
much
worse
