WRITES
IM
NOT
IM
IN
CANADA
WE
HAVE
FAR
FEWER
SHOOTINGS
LIKE
THIS
WE
HAVE
HAD
I
BELIEVE
ONE
MASS
MURDER
IN
THE
LAST
TWENTY
YEARS
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
SAY
WE
DONT
HAVE
OUR
GUN
PROBLEMS
BUT
WE
DO
HAVE
THE
WORLDS
LARGEST
UNDEFENDED
BOARDER
WITH
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
GUNHAPPY
COUNTRIES
IN
THE
WORLD
I
THINK
CANADA
ILLUSTRATES
THAT
GUN
CONTROL
DOES
HAVE
AN
EFFECT
IN
FACT
ITS
SUPRISING
THAT
THERE
IS
ANY
DIFFERENCE
CONSIDERING
HOW
EASY
IT
IS
TO
SMUGGLE
A
GUN
FROM
THE
US
YES
ITS
AMAZING
ISNT
IT
IN
FACT
IT
SHOULD
TELL
YOU
THAT
GUN
CONTROL
IS
NOT
THE
REASON
YOUR
CRIME
RATE
IS
LOW
SINCE
ANY
IDIOT
CAN
SMUGGLE
GUNS
INTO
CANADA
FROM
THE
US
AT
ANY
TIME
I
THINK
PAUL
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
THE
POINT
THAT
ANY
IDIOT
DOESNT
THERE
ARE
SURELY
SOME
IDIOTS
WHO
DO
SMUGGLE
GUNS
BUT
PAUL
SEEMS
TO
FEEL
THAT
THE
EXIS
TENCE
OF
STRICTER
GUN
CONTROL
LAWS
HAS
HAD
A
DETERRENT
EFFECT
THIS
SEEMS
A
STRANGE
ARGUMENT
TO
MAKE
CONSIDERING
THAT
CANADAS
VIOLENT
CRIME
RATE
IN
GENERAL
IS
FAR
LOWER
THAN
THAT
OF
THE
US
OUR
NONGUN
CRIME
RATE
IS
GREATER
THAN
THEIR
ENTIRE
CRIME
RATE
IT
WOULD
SEEM
STRANGE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
IT
TO
WERE
THE
RESULT
OF
GUN
CONTROL
LAWS
I
THINK
IF
WE
LOOKED
WED
FIND
VERY
SPECIFIC
CULTURAL
AND
ENFORCEMENT
REASONS
WHY
THE
NONGUN
RATE
IS
LOW
AS
WELL
AND
THEN
THAT
REASONS
COULD
BE
APPLIED
TO
THE
WITHGUN
RATES
AS
EASILY
GIVEN
THAT
MOST
CRIMINALLY
USED
GUNS
ARE
EITHER
LEGALLY
PURCHASED
OR
STOLEN
FROM
THOSE
WHO
PURCHASE
THEM
LEGALLY
HAVING
MORE
RESTRICTIONS
ON
LEGAL
POSSESSION
DOES
SEEM
TO
HAVE
THE
EFFECT
OF
REDUCING
GUNRELATED
CRIMES
ASIDE
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
I
FIND
THE
IDEA
OF
BEING
PUNISHED
BECAUSE
SOMEBODY
MIGHT
STEAL
SOMETHING
FROM
ME
AND
GO
AND
COMMIT
A
CRIME
WITH
IT
A
SILLY
SOLUTION
IT
STILL
DOESNT
ADDRESS
THE
QUESTION
OF
CANADA
WHICH
IS
NOW
BY
THE
WAY
BLAMING
THEIR
RISING
GUNCRIME
RATE
ON
THE
US
STRANGE
THAT
THE
BORDER
USED
TO
MAGICALLY
KEEP
THE
GUNS
OUT
BUT
NOW
ISNT
IT
CERTAINLY
MAKES
SENSE
THAT
IT
WOULD
WELL
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
SOME
OF
US
ANYWAY
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
COIN
OF
COURSE
IS
THAT
FAR
ILLEGAL
DRUGS
ARE
PURCHASES
LEGALLY
OR
STOLEN
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
PURCHASE
THEM
LEGALLY
IVE
STILL
NOT
BEEN
CONVINCED
THAT
GUNS
A
COMMODITY
WHICH
CRIMINALS
HAVE
SHOWN
THEIR
PERFECTLY
WILLING
TO
PAY
FOR
FROM
ILLEGAL
SOURCES
STOLEN
EITHER
FROM
POLICE
MILITARY
OR
CIVILIAN
WE
WOULDNT
SIMPLY
SEE
SOUTH
AMERICAN
SOURCES
FROM
WHICH
DRUGS
COME
START
SMUGGLING
GUNS
AS
WELL
SINCE
THERES
A
THRIVING
GUN
MANUFACTURING
INDUSTRY
DOWN
THERE
IF
YOU
WOULD
JUST
LOOK
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
AT
THE
CRIME
STATISTICS
YOU
WOULD
REALIZE
THAT
OUR
NONGUN
CRIME
RATE
IS
ALSO
VERY
HIGH
SO
GUNS
PER
SE
ARE
NOT
THE
ISSUE
DIRECTLY
CONTRADICTED
BY
THE
NEJM
STUDY
THAT
COMPARED
CRIME
IN
SEATTLE
AND
VANCOUVER
BC
THE
NONGUN
RATES
WERE
ROUGHLY
THE
SAME
FOR
BOTH
CITIES
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
VIOLENT
CRIME
RATES
WAS
ALMOST
TOTALLY
GUNRELATED
AND
AS
WAS
NOT
POINTED
OUT
IN
THE
STUDY
BUT
IN
CRITIQUES
OF
IT
TWO
SEPERATE
ARTICLES
BY
JAMES
WRIGHT
AND
DAVID
KOPEL
COME
TO
MIND
IT
WAS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
WAS
ALSO
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
MINORITY
RELATED
THAT
IS
THE
GUN
CRIME
RATE
SKYROCKETED
FOR
POOR
MINORITIES
BLACKS
AND
HISPANICS
PRIMARILY
WHILE
WHEN
YOU
COMPARED
THE
WHITE
MAJORITY
THEY
WERE
VIRUTALLY
IDENTICAL
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
NEJM
STUDY
WAS
THEY
COMPARED
MINORITY
VS
NONMINORITY
PERCENTAGES
BUT
FAILED
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
RELATIVE
CONDITIONS
OF
THOSE
MINORITIES
THAT
THERE
WAS
AN
EQAUL
PERCENTAGE
OF
NOMNWHITES
WAS
ABOUT
AS
FAR
AS
THEY
WENT
THEY
FAILED
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THAT
THE
NONWHITES
IN
EITHER
CITY
WERE
NOT
LIVING
IN
THE
SAME
CONDITIONS
IF
THE
SITUATION
WAS
ENTIRELY
BASED
ON
AVAILABILITY
OF
GUNS
THEN
WED
EXPECT
THAT
THE
WHITE
RATES
THE
TWO
GROUPS
WHICH
ARE
ARGUABLY
FAIRLY
COMPARATIVE
IN
THE
TWO
CITIES
WOULD
HAVE
A
FAR
HIGHER
RATE
IN
SEATTLE
YET
THE
MAJORITY
IN
SEATTLE
IS
NOT
ONLY
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
HIGHER
WHEN
THE
MINORITIES
ARE
EXCLUDED
BUT
SLIGHTLY
LOWER
VIOLENT
CRIME
IS
HIGHLY
CONCENTRATED
IN
THE
INNER
CITY
SURPRISE
PICK
THE
AREA
WITH
THE
HIGHEST
INCIDENCE
OF
POVERTY
DRUG
USE
DISEASE
ETC
SINCE
RATES
ARE
LOWER
IN
SUBURBIA
US
MIDDLE
CLASS
FOLKS
CAN
IGNORE
THE
PROBLEM
THE
POINT
IS
OF
COURSE
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
US
INNERCITY
PROBLEMS
ARE
NOT
MIRRORED
IN
CANADA
AS
SUCH
IF
THERE
IS
A
CONDITION
WHICH
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
IN
CANADA
FROM
THE
US
AND
VIOLENT
CRIME
IS
HIGHLY
CORRELATED
TO
THAT
AREA
SUGGESTING
THAT
GUN
CONTROL
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
CANADAS
LOW

IS
HIGHLY
QUESTIONABLE
AS

CANADIAN
POINTED

CANADAS
MAJOR
GUN
CONTROL
IN
DID
NOT
RESULT
IN
EITHER
A
REDUCTION
OR
A
SLOWING
OF
AN
INCREASE
IN
VIOLENT
CRIME
RATES
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
RISING
STEADILY
SINCE
APPARENTLY
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
MIRROR
THE
USS
VERY
LARGE
DROP
OF
VIOLENT
CRIME
IN
THE
EARLY
EIGHTIES
MOST
VIOLENT
CRIME
OCCURS
IN
AREAS
WITH
STRICT
GUN
CONTROL
ALREADY
POST
HOC
ERGO
PROPTER
HOC
THOSE
AREAS
IMPLEMENTED
GUN
CONTROL
BECAUSE
OF
THE
HIGH
RATES
TRUE
ONLY
TO
A
CERTAIN
EXTENT
TAKE
WASHINGTON
DC
WHERE
GUN
CONTROL
WAS
INSTITUTED
WHILE
IT
HAD
CRIME
PROBLEMS
TRUE
BUT
THAT
CRIME
PROCEEDED
TO
EXPLODE
AFTERWARDS
SIMILARLY
FOR
NEW
YORK
THE
QUESTION
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
A
POINT
IN
TIME
WHERE
CRIME
WAS
HIGH
OR
LOW
DID
THE
GUN
CONTROL
SIGNIFICANTLY
AND
POSITIVELY
IMPACT
VIOLENT
CRIME
SINCE
ITS
GONE
UP
IN
THOSE
AREAS
OFTEN
FASTER
THAN
IT
WAS
GOING
UP
BEFORE
YOU
CANT
SIMPLY
DISMISS
THE
HIGH
CRIME
RATE
BY
SAYING
GUN
CONTROL
WAS
CAUSED
BY
IT
YES
GUN
CONTROL
MAY
BE
INSTITUTED
TO
DEAL
WITH
HIGH
CRIME
BUT
IF
THE
CRIME
IS
NOT
POSITIVELY
IMPACTED
YOU
CANT
CONTINUALLY
SAY
THAT
THAT
CRIME
RATE
WAS
ENTIRELY
A
CAUSE
OF
THAT
GUN
CONTROL
SINCE
MUCH
OF
THAT
CRIME
RATE
INCREASED
AFTER
GUN
CONTROL
WAS
IMPLEMENTED
JUST
AS
HAPPENED
IN
CANADA
SIMILAR
OR
WORSE
RATES
EXIST
IN
CITIES
WITH
POOR
GUN
CONTROL
AS
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
IF
VIOLENT
CRIME
WAS
GENERALLY
INDEPENDENT
OF
GUN
CONTROL
AND
THE
JURY
IS
STILL
OUT
ON
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
RECENT
TOUGH
LAWS
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
MAY
HAVE
ALLEVIATED
VIOLENCE
AND
SUICIDE
RATES
THERE
WOULD
THIS
BE
THE
LAWS
WHICH
MADE
MANUFACTURERS
LIABLE
FOR
WHAT
OTHERS
DID
WITH

SUDDENLY
