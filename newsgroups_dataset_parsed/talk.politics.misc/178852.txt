WRITES
WELL
IT
SEEMS
THE
NATIONAL
SALES
TAX
HAS
GOTTEN
ITS
VERY
OWN
CNN
NEWS
LOGO
COOL
THAT
MEANS
WELL
BE
SEEING
IT
OFTEN
MAN
I
SURE
AM
GLAD
THAT
I
QUIT
WORKING
OR
TAKING
THIS
SERIOUSLY
IN
IF
I
KEPT
BUSTING
MY
ASS
WATCHING
TIME
GO
BY
BEING
FRUSTRATED
ID
BE
PRETTY
DAMN
MAD
BY
NOW
I
JUST
WISH
I
HAD
THE
EMAIL
ADDRESS
OF
TOTAL
GUMBY
WHO
WAS
SAYING
THAT
CLINTON
DIDNT
PROPOSE
A
NST
ACTUALLY
JERRY
BROWN
ESSENTIALLY
DIDAND
CLINTON
IN
HIS
DEMAGOGUE
PERSONA
CONDEMNED
BROWN
FOR
IT
IN
THE
CRUCIAL
NY
PRIMARY
LAST
YEAR
HOWEVER
WHY
DONT
THE
REPUBLICANS
GET
THEIR
ACT
TOGETHER
AND
SAY
THEY
WILL
SUPPORT
A
BROADBASED
VAT
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
VISIBLE
THE
VAT
IN
CANADA
IS
VISIBLE
UNLIKE
THE
INVISIBLE
VATS
THEY
HAVE
IN
EUROPE
AND
SUGGEST
A
RATE
SUFFICIENT
TO
HALVE
INCOME
AND
CORPORATE
AND
CAPITAL
GAINS
TAX
RATES
AND
AT
A
RATE
SUFFICIENT
TO
GIVE
THE
CLINTONS
ENOUGH
REVENUE
FOR
THEIR
HEALTH
CARE
REFORM
AND
FORCE
AN
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
DEMOCRATS
THAT
THE
TOP
INCOME
TAX
RATE
WOULD
THEN
BE
FROZEN
FOR
THE
FORSEEABLE
FUTURE
AND
COULD
BE
INCREASED
ONLY
VIA
A
NATIONAL
REFERENDUM
WHY
NOT
MAKE
USE
OF
THE
CLINTONS
TO
DO
SOMETHING
WORTHWHILE
SHIFT
THE
TAX
BURDEN
FROM
INVESTMENT
TO
CONSUMPTION
AND
GET
HEALTH
CARE
REFORM
AND
A
FROZEN
LOW
TOP
MARGINAL
