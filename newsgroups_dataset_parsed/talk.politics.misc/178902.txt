such
a
hostage
situation
has
taken
place
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
result
of
the
police
trying
to
take
the
place
by
force
and
the
result
being
the
death
of
the
hostages
and
the
gunmen
however
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
the
blame
landing
squarely
on
the
police
in
this
country
we
have
a
policy
of
not
negotiating
a
back
down
from
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
since
that
only
encourages
other
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
richard
that
people
are
at
risk
and
that
some
die
during
a
hostage
situation
might
be
considered
an
acceptable
scenario
in
storming
a
compound
when
everyone
dies
save
for
nine
people
including
twenty
children
the
outcome
must
be
considered
a
failure
now
was
the
failure
due
to
unforseeable
circumstances
incompetence
or
negligence
from
the
double
talk
and
multiple
stories
ive
seen
on
the
news
coming
from
the
fbi
and
reno
i
find
it
was
an
honest
mistake
hard
to
swallow
lets
hope
they
get
their
stories
straight
for
the
second
round
of
questions
