CRAMER
WRITES
YOU
MIGHT
EXCEPT
THAT
GAY
MEN
ARE
MUCH
MORE
PROMISCUOUS
THAN
STRAIGHT
MEN
WHICH
SHOWS
HOW
DAMAGED
AND
SCREWED
UP
GAY
MEN
ARE
OKAY
CLAYTOON
LET
US
SAY
THAT
HYPOTHETICALLY
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
GAY
MEN
ARE
MUCH
MORE
PROMISCUOUS
THAN
STRAIGHT
MEN
WHY
DOES
THIS
INDICATE
THEY
ARE
SCREWED
UP
PEOPLE
BTW
IT
OCCURS
TO
ME
THAT
SINCE
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
MEN
ARE
MUCH
MORE
INTERESTED
IN
SEX
THAN
WOMEN
AND
WANT
TO
HAVE
SEX
MUCH
EARLIER
IN
A
RELATIONSHIP
THAN
WOMEN
DO
THAT
HOMOSEXUALS
WOULD
HAVE
SEX
MORE
OFTEN
SIMPLY
BECUASE
THEIR
PARTNER
IS
OF
A
LIKE
MIND
IE
HETEROSEXUAL
MEN
WOULD
BE
MORE
PROMISCUOUS
IF
THEY
COULD
ITS
MY
OBSERVATION
THAT
WOMEN
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
ME
MORE
STRONGLY
INDOCTRONATED
INTO
NOW
WANTING
SEX
THAT
ARE
MEN
ALSO
THERE
ARE
DEFINITE
DOUBLE
STANDARDS
FOR
MEN
AND
WOMEN
WHO
ARE
PROMISCUOUS
COULD
THERE
ALSO
BE
A
FACTOR
OF
COMMUNICATION
BEING
MORE
DIRECT
IN
HOMOSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS
AND
CULTURE
