JEFFRY
R
BEACH
WRITES
I
WOULD
BE
UPSET
THAT
ALTHOUGH
ABORTIONS
WOULD
CONTINUE
THEY
WOULD
BE
A
LOT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
FOR
THE
RICH
AND
A
LOT
LESS
SAFE
FOR
THE
POOR
SO
NOW
THINGS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
LEGAL
JUST
TO
KEEP
THEIR
COST
DOWN
AND
THE
SAFETY
FACTOR
HIGH
IN
THE
CASE
OF
VICTIMLESS
CRIMES
YES
I
THINK
SO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
IF
I
ROB
OR
BEAT
UP
OR
RAPE
OR
KILL
SOMEONE
ITS
VERY
CLEAR
TO
ANYONE
NOT
A
SOCIOPATH
THAT
IVE
DONE
SOMETHING
IMMORAL
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
I
SMOKE
GRASS
OR
HAVE
SEX
WITH
A
CONSENTING
ADULT
IN
A
MANNER
ILLEGAL
IN
THAT
STATE
THE
MORALITY
OR
IMMORALITY
OF
THAT
ACT
IS
MERELY
A
LIFESTYLE
CHOICE
IT
DOESNT
CLEARLY
HURT
ANYONE
ELSE
IMO
IF
SUCH
AN
ACT
DOESNT
HURT
ANOTHER
PERSON
IT
SHOULD
NOT
BE
INTERFERED
WITH
THINK
ABOUT
IT
SHOULDNT
ALL
DRUGS
THEN
BE
LEGALIZED
IT
WOULD
LOWER
THE
COST
AND
DEFINITELY
MAKE
THEM
SAFER
TO
USE
I
THINK
SO
AND
I
DONT
USE
DRUGS
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
LEGAL
ONES
ALCOHOL
AND
COFFEE
DON
