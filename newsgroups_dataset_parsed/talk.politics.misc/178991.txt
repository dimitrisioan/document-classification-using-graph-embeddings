heres
a
question
for
those
of
you
far
more
informed
about
health
care
than
i
am
my
almanac
quoting
oecd
health
data
lists
us
public
health
expenditures
for
as
being
of
gdp
or
of
total
health
expenditures
are
we
really
paying
of
our
expenditures
to
insure
of
our
population
heh
no
doubt
more
evidence
that
the
government
is
more
efficient
than
evil
for
profit
health
care
proving
once
again
that
brett
has
a
major
thinking
problem
two
groups
that
the
government
insure
are
the
elderly
and
the
medically
an
needy
those
who
have
impoverished
themselves
through
spending
for
medical
care
the
typical
elderly
person
spends
times
what
a
person
under
age
the
typical
medically
needy
person
spends
about
times
what
the
average
person
does
youve
got
to
adjust
those
data
brett
these
words
and
thoughts
are
my
own
i
am
not
bound
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
word
of
any
master
where
the
storm
carries
me
i
put
into
