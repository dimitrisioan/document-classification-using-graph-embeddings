AGREE
WITH
MUCH
OF
THIS
POST
ONE
POINT
SEEMS
MISDIRECTED
WHEN
STANDARDS
OF
LIVING
POPULATION
DENSITIES
AND
INDUSTRIAL
STRUCTURES
ARE
CONTROLLED
FOR
THE
UNITED
STATES
IS
NO
LESS
ENERGY
EFFICIENT
THAN
JAPAN
AND
MORE
ENERGY
EFFICIENT
THAN
MANY
OF
THE
GROUP
OF
SEVEN
NATIONS
AND
WHEN
CONTROLLED
FOR
USAGE
OF

GAS
ETC
ENERGY
EFFICIENCY
IN
ALL

TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
IDENTICAL
TO
TAKE

DENSITY
AS
AN

ONE
WAY
TO
REDUCE
ENERGY
USED
IN
TRANSPORTATION
IS
SURELY
TO
CONCENTRATE
THE
POPULATION
IN
DENSE
URBAN
AREAS

THIS
MIGHT
OF

HAVE
OTHER
DISADVANTAGES
POSSIBLY
EVEN
RELATING
TO
ENERGY
USE
THE
FACT
THAT
JAPAN
IS
FORCED
TO
DO
THIS
BY
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
COUNTRY
WHILE
THE
US
IS
NOT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
PEOPLE
IN
THE

WOULD
BE
UNABLE
TO
DO
THIS
