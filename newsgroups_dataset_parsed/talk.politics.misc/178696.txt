CRAMER
WRITES
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
A
FORM
OF
MENTAL
DISORDER
CAUSED
BY
CHILDHOOD
SEXUAL
ABUSE
AS
A
NUMBER
OF
RECENT
WORKS
SUGGEST
WHICH
NUMBER
IS
THAT
ZERO
THE
ONLY
TIME
I
HAVE
HEARD
MENTION
OF
SUCH
A
MECHANISM
IS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
FEMALE
HOMOSEXUALITY
RESULTING
FROM
HETEROSEXUAL
CHILDHOOD
ABUSE
AND
THIS
AS
ONLY
ONE
OF
SEVERAL
FACTORS
AFFECTING
THE
SAME
PERSON
AS
MR
CRAMER
APPEARS
TO
CONCENTRATE
ON
MALE
HOMOSEXUALITY
