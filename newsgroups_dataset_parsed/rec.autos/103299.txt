I
JUST
HAVE
GOT
TO
REMIND
ALL
OF
YOU
THAT
THIS
IS
IT
YES
THATS
RIGHT
SOMTIME
THIS
FALL
FORD
THE
GRANDDADDY
OF
CARS
WILL
BE
INTRODUCING
AN
ALLNEW
MEGACOOL
WAYTOOFASTFORACCORDDRIVERS
MUSTANG
ITS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
STREAMLINED
LOOKING
SIMILAR
TO
THE
MACH
III
CONCEPT
CAR
FORD
CAME
OUT
WITH
AROUND
JANUARY
I
CANT
WAIT
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HEAR
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
RECENTLY
IF
EVERYTHING
IVE
READ
IS
CORRECT
FORD
IS
DOING
NOTHING
BUT
RE
SKINNING
THE
EXISTING
MUSTANG
WITH
MINOR
SUSPENSION
MODIFICATIONS
AND
THE
PICTURES
IVE
SEEN
INDICATE
THEY
DIDNT
DO
A
VERY
GOOD
JOB
OF
IT
THE
NEW
MUSTANG
IS
NOTHING
BUT
A
RECYCLE
OF
A
YEAR
OLD
CAR
GEE
IS
IT
ALREADY
YES
IT
WILL
STILL
BE
ON
THE
FOX
PROGRAM
CHASIS
ANYTHING
THAT
WILL
BE
DIFFERE
NT
ON
THE
NEW
CAR
AS
FAR
AS
MECHANICALS
IS
UNKNOWN
THE
SUSPENSION
WILL
MOST
LIKELY
BE
CHANGED
AS
WELL
AS
THE
DRIVE
DRAIN
FROM
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
PRINTED
ON
IT
THERE
IS
NO
CLEAR
IDEA
OF
WHAT
WILL
BE
DONE
AS
SOME
SAY
IT
WILL
HAVE
THE
MODULAR
AND
OTHERS
THE
CURRENT
SMALL
BLOCK
JUST
HAVE
TO
WAIT
AND
SEE
ALSO
IS
FAR
AS
STYLING
GOES
FROM
WHAT
I
SEEN
IS
GOOD
A
RETURN
TO
TRADITION
C
SCOOP
ON
THE
SIDES
AND
ROOF
LINE
MUCH
LIKE
A
OR
FASTBACK
YOU
KNOW
IM
A
FORD
FAN
I
MUST
SAY
SO
IM
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
THE
NEXT
MUSTANG
I
HAVE
FAITH
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
A
FINE
PRODUCT
MORE
DESIREABLE
THAN
THE
CAMARO
IS
NOW
YOU
KNOW
THATS
MHO
THE
DIFFERENCES
THESE
DAYS
BETWEEN
FORD
AND
GM
ARE
NOT
SO
MUCH
THE
QUALITY
JUST
THE
PHILOSOPHY
IT
USED
TO
BE
QUALITY
AND
PHILOSOPHY
GM
IS
BARELY
CATCHING
UP
BUT
THEY
HAVE
MORE
ROOM
FOR
IMPROVEMENT
THAT
CAN
ONLY
BE
MADE
UP
IN
TIME
STSS
STILL
COME
OFF
THE
ASSEMBLY
LINE
WITH
SCREWED
UP
PAINT
STRIPES
AND
POOR
TRUNKDOORHOODPANEL
ALIGNMENTS
ITS
THOSE
YEAR
OLD
PLANTS
AND
THE
LATEST
GM
PRODUCTS
STILL
COME
WITH
THE
STANDARD
EQUIPMENT
RATTLEDASH
TM
BUT
LIKE
I
SAID
THEYRE
GETTING
BETTER
AND
MAKING
THE
MOVE
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
THEY
BEAT
FORD
TO
THE
MARKET
WITH
THE
CAMAROFIREBIRD
BUT
REALLY
ONLY
IN
WORDS
PRODUCTION
OF
THESE
VEHICLES
WILL
BE
LIMITED
UNTIL
THE
END
OF
THE
YEAR
KEEPING
SELLING
PRICES
ABOVE
MSRP
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
SINCE
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
TWITCHING
CAMARO
FANS
OUT
THERE
I
WOULDNT
PRESS
FORD
TO
HURRY
THE
MUSTANG
SINCE
THE
FINAL
WAIT
COULD
BE
WORTH
IT
BESIDES
NO
BOWTIE
FANATIC
IS
GONNA
BUY
THE
MUSTANG
ANYWAY
I
DO
NOT
PUT
MUCH
STOCK
IN
THE
MAG
RAGS
INSIDE
INFORMATION
OR
EVEN
FORD
REP
QUOTES
THE
TAURUS
WAS
PRETTY
MUCH
A
SURPRISE
WHEN
IT
WAS
FINALLY
DISCLOSED
IN
ITS
ENTIRETY
INSIDE
INFORMATION
HAD
THE
TAURUS
WITH
A
AND
REARWHEEL
DRIVE
AT
ONE
POINT
I
WOULDNT
LOOK
FOR
A
SIMPLE
REPANELED
MUSTANG
FOLKS
YOU
MAY
BE
CHEATING
YOURSELF
IF
YOU
DO
THERES
A
LOT
OF
POTENTIAL
FORD
HASNT
RELEASED
A
NEW
CAR
WITHOUT
A
IS
IN
YEARS
THE
MUSTANG
PROJECT
HAS
BEEN
BREWING
FOR
AT
LEAST
RIGHT
A
IS
COULD
HAPPEN
THOSE
MODULAR
ARE
OUT
THERE
TOO
IN
THE
INTEREST
OF
CAFE
AND
COMPETITION
DONT
RULE
THOSE
OUT
EITHER
YOUR
IGNORANT
IF
YOU
DO
AND
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
SPY
SHOTS
AND
ARTIST
RENDERINGS
OUT
THERE
WHO
REALLY
KNOWS
WHAT
ITLL
LOOK
LIKE
THE
MACH
III
DOUBT
IT
HIGHLY
THE
NEXT
MUSTANG
WILL
BE
FORDS
HIGHEST
PROFILE
CAR
IT
ATTRACTS
WAY
MORE
ATTENTION
THAN
THE
CAMAROFIREBIRD
BECAUSE
ITS
HERITAGE
IS
MORE
EMBEDDED
IN
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
DONT
LIE
TO
YOURSELF
AND
BELIEVE
FORD
WILL
FORFEIT
THAT
I
SUBMIT
THAT
THE
MUSTANG
WILL
BE
A
SUCCESS
ENOUGH
TO
ELICIT
DEFENSIVE
REMARKS
FROM
SOME
HEAVY
CAMARO
FANS
HERE
YOU
KNOW
INTELLIGENT
CRITICAL
SPEWS
LIKE
THE
MUSTANG
BITES
MAN
SOME
OF
YOU
ARE
ALREADY
BEGINNING
I
PREDICT
THAT
THE
MUSTANG
AND
CAMARO
WILL
BE
COMPARABLE
PERFORMERS
AS
USUAL
I
PREDICT
THAT
THE
DIFFERENCES
WILL
BE
IN
SUBJECTIVE
AREAS
LIKE
LOOKS
AND
FEEL
AS
USUAL
THE
CAMARO
IS
STILL
A
HUGE
AUTOMOBILE
THE
MUSTANG
WILL
RETAIN

AND
SHORT

THE
CAMARO
STILL
REACHES
OUT
TO
THE
FIGHTER

WHILE
THE

WILL
APPEAL

THE

WILL
STILL

WHILE
THE

WILL
CONTINUE

I
DO
THINK
THE
CAMARO
IS
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
CLEAR
WINNER
UNLESS
THE
FORD
GETS
THE

YOU
DONT
SERIOUSLY
BELIEVE
THAT
