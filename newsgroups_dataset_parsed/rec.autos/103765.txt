i
had
a
dream
that
my
dad
bought
a
viper
i
took
it
out
for
a
test
drive
without
his
knowledge
and
had
to
push
it
all
the
way
home
just
to
avoid
a
ticket
wierd
dream
i
wonder
what
it
means
velllets

der
passenger
seat
or

m
feeling
a
tad
bit
freudian
doubtless
inspired
by
the
magnificent
phallicness
some
word
