considering
switching
to
geico
insurance
but
have
heard
that
they
do
not
assign
a
specific
agent
for
each
policy
or
claim
i
was
worried
that
this
might
be
a
real
pain
when
you
make
a
claim
i
have
also
heard
that
they
try
to
get
rid
of
you
if
you
have
an
accident
ive
read
in
this
group
that
geico
has
funded
the
purchasing
of
radar
guns
by
police
depts
im
not
sure
where
maryland
and
other
states
to
the

the

of

and
driver

this
its
interesting
