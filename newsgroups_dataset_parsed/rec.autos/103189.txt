there
is
no
question
that
the
has
good
range
but
not
significant
enough
to
be
or
times
as
expensive
as
some
of
the
others
the
big
win
with
the
is
not
its
range
but
rather
its
directionality
and
multipletransmitter
tracking
which
you
later
called
a
gimmick
a
conclusion
i
disagree
with
since
the
detector
incorporates
multiple
receivers
its
not
surprising
that
its
significantly
more
expensive
while
the
added
capabilities
may
not
help
you
there
is
added
value
for
those
of
us
who
live
in
areas
where
there
are
a
lot
of
falsealarms
summary
way
too
expensive
and
not
a
significantly
better
performer
i
certainly
call
it
interesting
but
im
another
person
who
thinks
that
the
added
value
might
be
coming
at
too
high
a
cost
very
adequate
radar
detectors
are
available
for
less
than
half
the
cost
and
one
of
them
has
suited
me
rather
well
if
i
did
more
longdistance
travelling
in
areas
im
not
familiar
with
id
probably
consider
getting
the
because
its
additional
information
would
be
useful
in
discriminating
false
alarms
