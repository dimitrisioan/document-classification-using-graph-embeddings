THE
DEVIL
REINCARNATE
WRITES
YOU
WILL
BE
SURPRISED
AT
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
FORGET
THEIR
GLASSES
WHILE
DRIVING
AND
THEN
THERE
ARE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
JUST
PLAIN
DONT
GET
THEIR
EYES
CHECKED
ONCE
A
YEAR
AS
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
LOUSY
VISION
I
CAN
SEE
OBJECTS
AT
A
DISTANCE
WITHOUT
MY
GLASSES
HOWEVER
THEY
ARE
QUITE
FUZZY
AND
I
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
OUT
THE
DETAILS
BUT
I
CAN
CERTAINLY
TELL
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
THERE
I
WONT
ARGUE
TOO
MUCH
ABOUT
ANYTHING
I
AM
PROBABLY
ONE
OF
THOSE
THAT
THINK
THAT
WE
CANT
HAVE
ENOUGH
SAFETY
ON
THE
ROADS
I
WOULD
GLADLY
SACRIFICE
DISTRACTIONS
AS
YOU
CALL
IT
THAN
SOMEONE
HAVING
TROUBLE
SEEING
DANGER
EARLIER
ONE
SAVED
LIFE
JUSTIFIES
MORE
THAN
MY
LIFETIME
OF
DISTRACTIONS
FOR
ME
AND
THEN
THERE
IS
DAWN
AND
DUSK
WHEN
YOUR
EYES
HAVE
NOT
YET
ADJUSTED
TO
THE
POOR
LIGHT
AND
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
DRIVE
BLACKGREY
CARS
AND
THEN
THERE
IS
THE
CASE
WHERE
YOU
ARE
DRIVING
DOWN
A
TWOWAY
ONE
LANE
ROAD
AND
SOMEONE
IS
OVERTAKING
CARS
AND
COMING
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
DOESNT
SEE
YOU
BECAUSE
YOUR
LIGHTS
ARE
NOT
ON
OR
VICE
VERSA
AT
THAT
IS
QUITE
A
SMALL
REACTION
TIME
BUT
OF
COURSE
WE
ARE
TOO
MACHO
TO
THINK
WE
ARE
INVINCIBLE
AND
CAN
REACT
FASTER
THAN
THAT
ONLY
THE
POOR
SOD
WHO
YOU
DIDNT
SEE
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
A
NORMAL
LIFE
EVER
I
WORKED
OUT
THE
REACTION
TIME
IN
A
PREVIOUS
POST
AND
ITS
PLENTY
EVEN
FOR
AN
YEAR
OLD
GRANDMA
AS
LONG
AS
SPEEDS
ARE
IN
THE
MPH
RANGE
OR
LESS
IF
YOU
OR
SOME
OTHER
DRIVER
IS
GOING
WAY
FASTER
THAN
THAT
THEN
BE
CAREFUL
AS
ALWAYS
YOU
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
YOUR
DRIVING
ACTIONS
IF
YOU
PULL
OUT
TO
PASS
AND
CRASH
INTO
SOMEONE
FOR
WHATEVER
REASON
ITS
YOUR
FAULT
IF
YOU
CANT
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
I
MAY
JUST
KILL
THE
GUY
I
AGREE
THAT
I
WOULD
BE
AT
FAULT
AND
I
WILL
HAVE
MY
LICENSE
REVOKED
WHY
I
MIGHT
EVEN
GO
TO
THE
GAS
CHAMBER
BUT
THE
FACT
STILL
REMAINS
THAT
THE
GUY
IS
DEAD
SOMEONE
DIED
BECAUSE
I
WAS
TOO
STINGY
TO
PUT
ON
MY
LIGHTS
SEE
A
DAMN
THING
THEN
YOU
SHOULDNT
BE
DRIVING
LIGHTS
FAIL
FALLEN
TREES
OR
ROCKS
DONT
HAVE
LIGHTS
ETC
I
MAINTAIN
THAT
HEADLIGHT
STRENGTH
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
FALLEN
TREESROCKS
ON
THE
ROADS
TO
ONCOMING
TRAFFIC
IS
TOO
LOW
TO
EVEN
BE
CONSIDERED
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
ALSO
WORKING
ON
WHAT
WE
KNOW
COULD
HAPPEN
TO
WHAT
MIGHT
HAPPEN
RUNNING
LIGHTS
ARE
NOT
NECESSARY
FOR
MOTORISTS
WHO
DRIVE
AROUND
IT
MAY
BE
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
FORCE
THE
RUNNING
OR
HEADLIGHTS
ON
WHEN
YOU
TURN
YOUR
WINDSHIELD
WIPERS
ON
BUT
ONLY
BECAUSE
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
TOO
STUPID
TO
DO
SO
IF
YOU
CRASH
INTO
ONE
OF
THOSE
IDIOTS
YOU
HAVE
TO
FIGHT
IT
OUT
IN
COURT
TO
SHOW
HIS
NEGLEGENCE
IF
YOU
CAN
EVEN
PROVE
IT
JUST
OUT
OF
CURIOSITY
HOW
MUCH
GASMILAGE
DO
YOU
LOOSE
WHEN
YOU
PUT
YOUR
LIGHTS
ON
AND
HOW
MUCH
DO
YOU
REDUCE
THE
LIFE
OF
YOUR
HEADLAMPS
AND
WHAT
IS
THE
COST
OF
YOUR
HEADLAMPS
ANYWAY
MILEAGE
IS
CERTAINLY
REDUCED
BUT
BY
A
VERY
VERY
SMALL
AMOUNT
PROBABLY
ABOUT
WATTS
FOR
HEAD
AND
RUNNING
LIGHTS
THIS
IS
AN
EXTRA
HORSEPOWER
THAT
MUST
BE
MADE
BY
THE
ENGINE
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THIS
WILL
COST
YOU
AROUND
TWO
GALLONS
A
YEAR
BUT
TIMES
MILLION
CARS
THATS
A
LOT
OF
GAS
COMPARED
TO
THE
NUMBER
OF
GALLONS
OF
GAS
CONSUMED
BY
THOSE
MILLION
CARS
IT
IS
MINISCULE
WHATEVER
TIS
A
PITY
I
HAVE
TO
SHARE
THE
SAME
ROADS
WITH
A
PERSON
NOT
CONCERNED
WITH
SAFETY
S
SSAVEOLECDACCOM
LAMP
LIFE
IS
MEASURED
IN
HOURS
SO
IF
YOU
NORMALLY
DRIVE
IN
HALF
DAYLIGHT
AND
HALF
NIGHT
YOUR
LAMPS
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
REPLACED
TWICE
AS
OFTEN
HEADLAMPS
ONLY
COST
ABOUT
FOR
MOST
HALOGEN
LAMPS
THE
COST
TO
THE
INDIVIDUAL
IS
TRIVIAL
AND
TO
ME
IS
NOT
THE
ISSUE
WHAT
I
DONT
LIKE
IS
THE
DISTRACTIONS
ALL
THESE
CARS
WITH
HEADLIGHTS
CAUSE
I
DONT
NEED
TO
CONSTANTLY
SEE
THE
HEADLIGHTS
OF
THE
VEHICLE
BEHIND
ME
I
DONT
NEED
TO
SEE
THE
HEADLIGHTS
OF
EVERY
GOSH
DARN
CAR
FOR
A
MILE
DOWN
THE
ROAD
THESE
LIT
UP
CARS
MAKE
NONILLUMINATED
THINGS
LESS
VISIBLE
LIKE
PEDISTRIANS
AND
BIKES
HOPEFULLY
WERE
NOT
GOING
TO
MANDATE
DRLS
FOR
PEOPLE
AND
BIKES
TOO
A
STREAM
OF
TAILLIGHTS
IS
TOLERABLE
AS
ARE
THE
ORANGE
FRONT
RUNNING
LIGHTS
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
SUFFICIENT
FOR
OTHER
PEOPLE
TO
SEE
YOU
IF
THEY
LOOK
AND
DOESNT
DISTRACT
ME
NEARLY
AS
MUCH
AS
FULL
POWER
HEADLIGHTS
MARK
