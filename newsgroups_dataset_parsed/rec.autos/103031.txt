I
THINK
HES
TALKING
ABOUT
A
DIFFERENT
FORM
OF
RUSH
EVIDENTLY
ITS
FUN
TO
BE
TERRIFIED
BUT
HEY
IF
YOU
WANT
THAT
KIND
OF
RUSH
TRY
BOBSLEDDING
YOU
MAY
ONLY
GET
UP
TO
OR
SO
BUT
IT
MAKES
IN
A
CAR
FEEL
LIKE
A
STROLL
IN
THE
PARK
WHY
SHOULD
A
GOOD
DRIVER
BE
TERRIFIED
AT
THE
ONLY
THING
I
FEAR
GOING
AT
ARE
DRIVERS
WHO
SWITCH
TO
THE
LEFT
LANE
WITHOUT
USING
EITHER
REARVIEWMIRROR
OR
FLASHERS
DOING
TO
AINT
A
RUSH
FOR
ME
BUT
ITS
FUN
AND
I
GET
WHERE
I
WANT
TO
GO
MUCH
FASTER
BUT
IN
ONE
POINT
YOU
ARE
QUITE
RIGHT
IF
YOU
ARE
TERRIFIED
AT
YOU
SHOULD
BETTER
NOT
DRIVE
THAT
FAST
OR
YOULL
BE
A
HAZARD
TO
OTHERS
BTW
BEFORE
YOU
FLAME
ME
READ
MY
EMAIL
ADDRESS
I
KNOW
WHAT
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
AS
I
LIVE
IN
GERMANY

CRHREGENTETECHNIKTUMUENCHENDE
NOT
A
FLAME
JUST
A
POINT
ID
BE
SCARED
AT
HERE
NOT
BECAUSE
I
FEEL
I
OR
MY
CAR
COULDNT
HANDLE
IT
BUT
BECAUSE
OF
EXACTLY
WHAT
YOU
SAID
DRIVERS
WHO
ARE
STUPID
LIKE
THE
ONES
WHO
ARE
DOING
ALSO
AND
SO
THEY
PULL
IN
RIGHT
BEHIND
YOU
AT
MAYBE
CAR
LENGTHSOH
YEAH
REAL
SMART
THIS
SCARES
ME
IN
CITIES
AT
WHEN
I
CANT
SEE
ENOUGH
OF
THE
CAR
TO
MAKE
IT
RECOGNIZABLE
THEY
ARE
FOLLOWING
TOO
CLOSE
AND
WHEN
I
SEE
THEM
DOING
THIS
AND
READING
A
NEWSPAPERSIGHTHIS
IS
WHY
AMERICA
HAS
SPEED
LIMITS
OUR
DRIVERS
ARE
TOO
DUMB
TO
REALISE
THAT
READING
THE
PAPER
SHOULD
BE
DONE
AT
BREAKFAST
OR
WORK
NOT
IN
THEIR
CAR
MY
THOUGHTS
DREW
