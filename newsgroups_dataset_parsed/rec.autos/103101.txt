RE
CAR
BUYING
STORY
WAS
CHRIST
ANOTHER
DEALER
SERVICE
SCAM
FROM
ARTICLE
BY
MARKMBIGFOOTSPSMOTCOM
MARK
MONNINGER
THIS
KIND
OF
BEHAVIOR
IS
WHAT
I
WAS
SHOCKED
BY
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
FOR
CRYING
OUT
LOUD
HOW
DO
THESE
TURKEYS
THINK
THEY
CAN
TALK
TO
CUSTOMERS
THIS
WAY
AND
STILL
STAY
IN
BUSINESS
AGAIN
I
DONT
EXPECT
SALES
PEOPLE
TO
BOW
SCRAPE
AND
GROVEL
IN
MY
PRESENCE
BUT
I
SURE
DONT
EXPECT
TO
BE
ABUSED
EITHER
I
WAS
VERY
SURPRISED
BY
THE
WAY
THE
SALES
PEOPLE
TALKED
TO
ME
AND
IN
OTHER
NEGOTIATING
SESSIONS
I
OVERHEARD
IN
NEIGHBORING
SALES
CUBICLES
EVIDENTLY
THEIR
SUCCESS
RATE
IS
HIGH
ENOUGH
THAT
THEY
CONTINUE
TO
DO
BUSINESS
THIS
WAY
THERE
MUST
BE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
WHO
ARE
EASY
TO
INTIMIDATE
A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
AGO
I
WENT
TO
A
DEALERSHIP
TO
TEST
DRIVE
A
CAR
AFTERWARDS
WE
SAT
DOWN
TO
DISCUSS
PRICES
I
EXPLAINED
THAT
I
WANTED
A
CAR
JUST
LIKE
THE
ONE
I
DROVE
BUT
IN
A
DIFFERENT
COLOR
HE
SAID
HE
COULD
GET
ONE
EXACTLY
LIKE
I
WANTED
FROM
THE
DEALER
NETWORK
WITHIN
A
DAY
WE
THEN
NEGOTIATED
A
PRICE
AND
SIGNED
THE
DEAL
NEXT
DAY
I
GET
A
CALL
HE
EXPLAINS
THAT
THEY
GOOFED
AND
THEY
HAD
NEGLECTED
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
A
PRICE
INCREASE
THE
LAST
PRICE
INCREASE
HAD
OCCURRED
OVER
MONTHS
PRIOR
TO
MY
VISIT
IF
I
STILL
WANTED
THE
CAR
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
FORK
OVER
ANOTHER
AS
AN
ALTERNATIVE
THEY
WOULD
HONOR
THE
PRICE
IF
I
BOUGHT
THE
CAR
I
TEST
DROVE
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
AROUND
FOR
MONTHS
AND
HAD
A
FEW
MILES
ON
IT
I
SAID
GOODBYE
THIS
WAS
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
THEY
CAN
LOWBALL
YOU
AND
STILL
COVER
THEIR
BUTTS
ITS
TOO
BAD
MORE
PEOPLE
DONT
DEMAND
HONESTY
OR
THESE
TYPES
OF
DEALERS
WOULD
NO
LONGER
BE
IN
BUSINESS
THE
NEXT
DEALERSHIP
I
WENT
TO
WAS
STRAIGHTFORWARD
AND
HONEST
FIRST
THING
THE
SALESMAN
SAID
WAS
LETSS
SEE
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
FOR
DEALER
COST
AND
WORK
OUT
HOW
MUCH
PROFIT
I
SHOULD
MAKE
THE
DEAL
WENT
THROUGH
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
STEVE
