WRITES
HELLO
I
FIND
THIS
METHOD
MUCH
BETTER
MYSELF
TOO
ALTHOUGH
I
DO
REALLY
HATE
IT
WHEN
THE
BOLT
FINALLY
COMES
LOOSE
AND
THE
WRENCH
AND
MY
HAND
BOTH
COME
CRASHING
INTO
MY
FACE
AFTER
COMING
TO
WHICH
IS
ABOUT
MINUTES
LATER
I
CHANGE
MY
CLOTHES
BECAUSE
BY
THIS
TIME
ALL
THE
OIL
HAS
DRAINED
ON
ME
AND
ICE
MY
ENTIRE
FACE
AND
SUCK
DOWN
ABOUT
TYLENOL
TO
EASE
THE
PAIN
LATER
IN
THE
DAY
I
THEN
PROCEED
WITH
REFILLING
THE
ENGINE
OIL
ITS
JUST
CRAZY
HOW
I
TRY
AND
CHANGE
THE
OIL
ON
MY
CARS
IN
ONE
WEEKENDI
GO
THROUGH
ABOUT
BOTTLES
OF
TYLENOL
AND
BAGS
OF
ICE
