WHY
CRAWL
UNDER

CAR
AT

I
HAVE
A
MACHINE
I
GOT
FOR
MY
BOAT
THAT
PULLS
THE
OIL
OUT
UNDER
SUCTION
THROUGH
THE
DIP
STICK
TUBE
IT
DOES
AN
EXCELLENT
JOB
AND
BY
MOVING
THE
SUCTION
TUBE
AROUND
YOU
CAN
GET
MORE
OLD
OIL
OUT
THAN
BY
USING
THE
DRAIN
PLUG
I
THINK
I
PAID
AT
EB
MARINE
THE
OIL
GOES
INTO
A
STEEL
GAL
CAN
WAIT
UNTIL
IT
COOLS
AND
DECANT
INTO
YOUR
FAVORITE
DEVICE
I
USE
SOFT

BOTTLES
EASY
TO
TAKE
THEM
DOWN
TO
THE
LOCAL
OIL
RECYCLE
CENTER

DOES
SOUND
GOOD
BUT
I
HEARD
IT
TENDS
TO
LEAVE
MORE
GRIT
ETC
IN
THE
OIL
PAN
ALSO
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
TO
CHANGE
THE
OLD
WHEN
ITS
HOT
BEFORE
THE
GRIT
HAS
MUCH
