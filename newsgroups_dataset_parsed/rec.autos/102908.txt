RIGHT

HAS
KM
OR
ABOUT
MILES
ON
IT
A
TYPICAL
MILEAGE
FOR
CARS
SEEM
TO
BE
ABOUT
KM
OR
ABOUT

THE
SELLER
JUST
INFORMED
ME
THAT
WHEN
HE
BROUGHT
THE
CAR
IN
FOR
CERTIFICATION
HE
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THE
FRONT
BREAK
PADS
AND
THE
EXHAUSTS
HAD
TO
BE
REPLACED
TO
MEET
THE
LEGAL
STANDARDS
HE
SAID
HE
WILL
REPLACE
THE
COMPONENTS
BEFORE
SELLING
THE
CAR
TO
ME
BEING
COPMLETELY
IGNORANT
TO
THE
TECHNICAL
STUFF
ON
CARS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THIS
COULD
MEAN
IS
KM
ABOUT
THE
TIME
TYPICAL
FOR
REPLACING
THE
ABOVE
MENTIONED
ITEMS
OR
IS
THIS
AN
INDICATION
THAT
THE
CAR
WAS
ABUSED
WOULD
OTHER

BREAK
DOWN
OR
HAVE
TO
BE
REPLACED
SOON
THE
SELLER
TOLD
ME
THAT
HE
USED
THE
CAR
ON
THE
HIGHWAY
A
LOT

VERIFY

TINY
DOTS
IN
THE
FRONT
EDGE

ALTHOUGH
THE
MAXIMA
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
CAR
AND
THE
CAR
IS
VERY
CLEAN
AND
WELL
KEPT
ITS
CURRENTLY
OUT
OF
WARRANTY
A
SIMILARLY
PRICED
ACCORD
WITH
KM
WILL
HAVE
YEARS
OR
KM
WORTH
OF
WARRANTY
LEFT
AND
I
DONT
WANT
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
PAYING
FOR
ANY
REPAIR
BILLS
BUT
I
ALSO
NEED
A
CAR
FOR
PEOPLE
WHEN
WILL
THE
NEW
