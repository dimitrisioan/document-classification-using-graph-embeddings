DEALER
CHEATED

READING
NEED
HELP
HERE
IS
A
STORY
I
BOUGHT
A
CAR
ABOUT
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
FINALLY
CAN
GET
HOLD
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
OF
THE
CAR
AND
GOT
ALL
MAINTANENCE
HISTORY
OF
THE
CAR
IN
BETWEEN
AND
THE
INSTRUMENT
PANNEL
OF
THE
CAR
HAS
BEEN
REPLACED
AND
THE
ODOMETER
ALSO
HAS
BEEN
RESET
TO
ZERO
THEREFORE
THE
TRUE
METER
READING
IS
THE
READING
BEFORE
REPLACEMENT
PLUS
CURRENT
MILEAGE
THAT
SHOWS
MILE
DIFFERENCE
COMPARING
TO
THE
MILEAGE
ON
THE
ODOMETER
DISCLOSURE
FROM
THE
DEALER
NEVER
TOLD
ME
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THAT
IMPORTANT
STORY
I
HOPE
THAT
I
CAN
RETURN
THE
CAR
WITH
FULL
REFUND
DO
U
THINK
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCES
ANY
COMMENTS
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED
THANKS
SOMETHING
THAT
HAPPENED
IN
SOUTH
AFRICA
ABOUT
A
YEAR
AGO
A
DEALER
SOLD
A
MERCEDES
WITH
AN
ODOMETER
READING
OF
KILOMETERS
TO
A
LADY
TURNED
OUT
THAT
THE
ACTUAL
READING
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
COURT
CASE
FOLLOWED
BECAUSE
LADY
SAID
SHE
WOULDNT
HAVE
BOUGHT
A
CAR
WITH
THAT
MUCH
KMS
DEALER
FOUND
QUILTY
FINED
AND
HAD
TO
TAKE
BACK
THE
CAR
I
THINK
YOU
HAVE
A
CASE
IF
YOU
CAN
GET
A
SWORN
STATEMENT
FROM
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
TAKE
THE
CAR
BACK
TO
THE
DEALER
AND
THREATEN
HIM
OR
SOMETHING
GERRIT
