gki
hear
that
tires
for
this
car
can
get
really
expensive
i
gkcurrently
have
goodyear
that
cost
the
previous
owner
gkfor
four
try
eagle
gas
wear
better
cost
less
lose
little
handling
and
are
quieter
im
going
to
switch
to
in
my
next
set
with
new
rims
fitti
twists
if
i
can
afford
em
by
the
time
my
gas
wear
out
gkis
a
whole
new
ritual
for
me
with
that
fangled
pedal
also
i
began
gkto
wonder
how
strong
that
brake
really
is
today
i
backed
out
of
gkparking
spot
today
and
started
to
drive
away
before
i
noticed
gkthe
glowing
brake
light
oops
mine
is
strong
enough
to
not
let
the
car
move
when
its
in
even
if
youre
giving
it
enough
gas
to
normally
move
it
in
you
might
need
a
brake
adjustment
gkthe
drivers
power
window
creaks
when
closed
all
the
way
the
same
gkthing
happens
in
my
parents
mercury
sable
oddly
all
the
gkother
windows
work
smoothly
watch
it
closely
the
glass
actually
flexes
from
the
torque
in
the
motor
it
seems
stronger
in
the
drivers
window
then
the
others
gkim
liking
the
interior
amenities
more
and
more
each
day
the
gkcupholders
are
great
ive
found
the
location
under
the
armrest
in
between
the
seats
to
be
a
pain
but
like
having
them
they
moved
it
into
the
dash
pop
out
in
the
model
year
much
better
gki
really
feel
like
i
dont
deserve
this
car
i
really
cant
gkbelieve
that
i
could
afford
it
i
got
this
car
ten
years

of
schedule

the
same
thing
