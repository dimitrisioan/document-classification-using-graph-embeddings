before
you
go
in
find
out
the
invoice
prices
of
the
car
add
a
reasonable
profit
for
the
dealer
offer
them
that
price
and
stick
to
it
whoa
watch
your
terminology
dealer
invoice
is
not
dealer
cost
thats
probably
true
but
its
the
closest
to
it
that
youre
going
to
get
the
actual
dealer
cost
depends
on
a
lot
of
things
and
even
the
dealer
probably
doesnt
know
exactly
what
it
will
be
until
all
the
factory
kickbacks
incentives
etc
are
paid
and
that
often
depends
on
his
volume
at
the
end
of
the
monthquarterwhatever
it
might
be
a
funny
munber
but
its
all
you
have
to
start
with
except
the
sticker
and
anyone
who
pays
sticker
price
is
really
being
ripped
off
mark
