my
car
was
recently
destroyed
in
a
hail
storm
i
fully
expected
to
get
jerked
around
by
the
insurance
company
i
wasnt
the
only
one
who
had
hail
damage
state
farm
opened
its
claim
centers
on
evenings
and
weekends
and
flew
down
additional
adjusters
from
dallas
i
have
no
experience
with
state
farm
but
i
think
its
important
to
differentiate
your
experience
from
a
typical
accident
hail
damage
is
clearly
not
the
fault
of
the
owner
and
also
tends
to
be
well
publicized
in
the
media
so
its
to
the
ins
cos
benefit
to
respond
promptly
and
helpfully
damage
like
this
doesnt
imply
anything
about
the
likelihood
of
future
claims
unless
you
live
in
an
area
that
gets
frequent
damaging
hail
storms
so
theres
no
reason
for
them
to
stop
covering
you
thats
a
lot
different
from
atfault
accidents
or
theftrelated
claims
which
may
be
more
indicative
of
claim
patterns
