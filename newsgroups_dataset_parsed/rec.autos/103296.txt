OF

WONDERING
IF
ANYBODY

OUT
THERE
IS
A
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTER
IVE
BEEN
DOING
IT
MY
SELF
OVER
MILES
ON
MY
CURRENT
TOYOTA
TRUCK
IVE
GOT
OVER
IVE
HEARD
PEOPLE
TALK
ABOUT
HOW

THIS
CAN
DAMAGE
A
TRANSMISSION
MY
EXPERIENCES
SUGGEST
OTHERWISE
WHAT
TECHNIQUES

ON
SOME
OLD
PIECES
OF

THE
ONLY
WAY
TO

TO
DATE
IVE
DRIVEN
RABBITS
DATSUNS
COMETS
FORDS
A
CHEVY
SOME
WHERE
HARDER
THAN
OTHERS
TO
SHIFT
BUT
GENERALLY
THE
HIGHER
THE
MILAGE
THE
SMOOTHER
QUICKER
EASIER
THEY
WHERE
TO
SHIFT
MY
TECHNIQUE
IS
TO
EASE
BACK
OFF
THE
THROTTLE
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
GENTLY
WRIST
BACK
ON
THE
SHIFT
LEVER

FOR
SOME
REASON
I
MISS
THE
SHIFT

LIGHTLY
PRESS
THE
ACCELERATOR

FOUND
THAT
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTING
IS
EAISERQUICKER
AT
HIGH
RPMS
I
ALSO
SKIP
GEARS
SOME
TIMES
