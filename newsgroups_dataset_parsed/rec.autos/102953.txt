KNOW
THAT
NEWAGE
ATS
ARE
GREAT
IN
TRAFFIC
AND
DO
A
SATISFACTORY
JOB
IN
ACCELERATION
WHEN

CARPET
MY
QUESTION
REGARDS
DOWNSHIFTING
NOT
DOWNSHIFTING
TO

GOOD
AT
THIS
NOW
BUT
MANUALLY
MOVING
THE
LEVER
TO
OR
AT
A
POINT
WHERE
YOU
WOULD
DOWNSHIFT
A
MANUAL
EG
APPROACHING
A
RED
LIGHT
OR
A
CURVE
OR
JUST
TOOLING
AROUND
A
PARKING
LOT
IN

WO
SHIFTING

IS
WHY
IM
STILL
A
MANUALTRANS
BIGOT
THE
DOWNSHIFTING
FOR
DECELERATION
SEEMS
SO
NATURAL
WHEN

THE
TRANNY
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
I
WANT
ADDENDUM
ISNT
IT
GREAT
AFTER
DOWNSHIFTING
WHILE
APPROACHING
THAT
RED
LIGHT
WHEN
THE

GREEN
AND

ONCAM
OR
THE
TURBOS
