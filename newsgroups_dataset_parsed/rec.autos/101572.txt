SHAREN
A
RUND
WRITES
APPARENTLY
YOURE
NOT
A
WOMAN
MY
HUSBAND
HATES
THE
AUTO
DOOR
LOCKS
FEATURES
BUT
FORGETS
THAT
BESIDES
FAMILIES
WITH
CHILDREN
A
WOMAN
FEELS
SAFER
IN
A
CAR
THAT
LOCKS
EASILY
IN
ADDITION
TO
WATCHING
AROUND
CHECKING
OUT
IF
ANYONES
NEAR
ME
WHEN
I
GET
TO
MY
CAR
NEVER
PARK
IN
A
SECLUDED
SPOT
ETC
HAVE
MY
KEYS
READY
TO
OPEN
THE
DOOR
SO
IM
NOT
FUMBLING
IN
MY
PURSE
LOOKING
FOR
THEM
THIS
HAS
ME
THINKING
IS
THERE
A
BIOLOGICAL
REASON
WHY
WOMEN
CANT
PUT
THEIR
KEYS
IN
THEIR
PANTS
POCKETS
LIKE
MEN
DO
I
HAVE
TWO
POCKETS
ON
THE
BACK
OF
EACH
OF
MY
PANTS
I
PUT
MY
KEYS
IN
ONE
AND
WALLENT
IN
ANOTHER
MANY
OF
THE
POCKETS
EVEN
HAVE
A
BOTTON
ON
THEM
SO
I
CAN
CLOSE
THEM
SECURELY
EVERYTHING
IS
THAT
MUCH
SIMPLER
FOR
ME
WHY
CANT
WOMEN
DO
THE
SAME
IS
IS
BIOLOGICAL
IE
NOT
ENOUGH
ROOM
FOR
A
BIGGER
BOTTOM
PLUS
KEYS
AND
A
WALLET
OR
IS
IT
THE
WAY
THEY
ARE
RAISED
BY
THE
PARENTS
