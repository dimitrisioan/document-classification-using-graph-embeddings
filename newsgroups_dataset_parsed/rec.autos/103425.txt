BUYING
A
USED
CAR
I
HAVE
A
FEW
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
TAX
ON
A
USED
CAR
PURCHASE
I
LIVE
IN
NEW
YORK
STATE
AND
I
AM
GOING
TO
BUY
A
USED
CAR
I
KNOW
THAT
I
WILL
HAVE
TO
PAY
TAX
WHEN
I
GO
TO
REGISTER
THE
CAR
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
OF
TAX
IS
PAYED
ON
THE
BOOK
VALUE
OF
THE
CAR
OR
ON
THE
PURCHASE
PRICE
ALSO
WHAT
TAX
RATE
IS
USED
THE
OWNER
LIVES
IN
ALBANY
TAX
AND
I
WILL
BE
LIVING
IN
SARATOGA
WITH
TAX
DO
I
PAY
ALBANY
TAX
OR
SARATOGA
TAX
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
A
WHOLE
ONE
MORE
THING
HOW
MUCH
DOES
IT
COST
FOR
THE
USUAL
YEAR
REGISTRATION
DID
I
LEAVE
ANYTHING
OUT
WHAT
ELSE
MIGHT
I
HAVE
TO
KNOW
TO
PURCHASE
AND
REGISTER
A
USED
CAR
IVE
NEVER
DONE
THIS
BEFORE
THANK
YOU
