COMPILATION
OF

CHEVY
CAPRICE
MY
CAPRICE
CLASSIC
WITH
MILES
HAS
FINALLY
REACHED
THE
THRESHOLD
OF
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
MECHANICAL
PROBLEMS
THAT
I
AM
FORCED
TO
POST
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
WHO
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
GIVE
ME
SOME
POINTERS
ON
ONE
OR
MORE
OF
THE
BELOW
PLEASE
EMAIL
OR
POST
WHEN
MAKING
TURNS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
ACCELERATING
THERE
IS
USUALLY
A
LOUD
THUNK
FROM
THE
REAR
OF
OF
THE
CAR
SOUNDS
LIKE
IT
COULD
BE
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
WHAT
COULD
CAUSE
THIS
IS
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
GOING
BAD
I
RECENTLY
HAD
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
FLUID
CHANGED
AND
IT
DID
HAVE
TINY
METAL
BITS
IN
IT
AND
NO
THE
SOUND
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
ROLLING
AROUND
IN
THE
TRUNK

RELATIVELY
CLEAR
PEDAL
DOES
NOT
SLOWLY
SINK
TO
THE
FLOOR
WHEN
HELD
DOWN
PEDAL
DOES
NOT
FEEL
SPONGEY
BUT
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
BLEEDING
THE
BRAKES
MIGHT
HELP
COULD
ANYTHING
ELSE
CAUSE
THIS
TRANNY
TRANNY
PROBLEMS
SEEM
