LEE
GROVES
WRITES
AS
THE
OWNER
OF
AN
AND
HAVING
SEVERAL
FRIENDS
WHO
OWN
THEM
I
AM
VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE
WHEN
I
SEE
AN
AD
LIKE
THIS
WHEN
THESE
SEATS
ARE
SEEN
FOR
SALE
THEY
ARE
MOST
OFTEN
STOLEN
SO
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
SEE
A
STATEMENT
SAYING
WHERE
THEY
CAME
FROM
ILL
GIVE
THIS
SELLER
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
DOUBT
BUT
PEOPLE
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
THE
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
SEATS
ON
THE
MARKETESPECIALLY
THOSE
THAT
ARE
IN
CELICASARE
STOLEN
I
AM
THE
ORIGINAL
OWNER
OF
THE
SEATS
AND
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
I
TAKE
VERY
SERIOUS
OFFENCE
IN
YOUR
STATEMENT
ME
THINKS
THEE
DOST
PROTEST
TOO
MUCH
PLEASE
IN
THE
FUTURE
THINK
BEFORE
YOU
MAKE
ALLEGATIONS
LIKE
THE
ABOVE
HE
MADE
NO
ALLEGATIONS
AND
SPECIFICALLY
GAVE
THE
SELLER
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
DOUBT
HE
SIMPLY
MADE
THE
NET
AWARE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
MANY
OF
THESE
SEATS
ARE
STOLEN
SO
WATCH
OUT
AND
ASK
QUESTIONS
WHEN
BUYING
THATS
GOOD
ADVICE
TO
FOLLOW
WHEN
BUYING
ANYTHING
FROM
A
THIRD
PARTY
ON
THE
NET
OR
ELSEWHERE
IT
HURTS
