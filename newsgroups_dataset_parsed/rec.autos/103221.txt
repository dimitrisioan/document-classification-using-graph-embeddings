re
choice
of
gauges
if
im
going
to
drive
on
a
public
road
then
i
need
a
speedometer
and
an
odometer
helps
for
navigation
my
chevy
has
a
bare
minimum
enginetemp
and
oilpress
warning
lights
and
a
fuel
gauge
my
vw
has
tach
watertemp
voltmeter
and
oiltemp
gauges
if
i
had
a
turbo
car
id
want
a
vacuum
manifoldboost
gauge
an
oil
pressure
gauge
is
a
nice
reassuring
gauge
to
look
at
if
my
car
was
air
cooled
then
i
would
substitute
a
cylheadtemp
gauge
for
the
watertemp
gauge
a
few
years
ago
i
looked
at
the
audi
quattro
si
coupe
that
bobby
unser

to
win
the
