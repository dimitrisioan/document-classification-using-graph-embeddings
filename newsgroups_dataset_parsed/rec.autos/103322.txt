SEEKING
RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
NEW
CAR
PURCHASE
FOLKS
I
AM
GOING
TO
BE
PURCHASING
A
NEW
VEHICLE
IN
THE
NEXT
FEW
MONTHS
I
AM
TRYING
TO
HOLD
OUT
UNTIL
THE
FALL
SINCE
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
I
CAN
BE
IN
A
BETTER
NEGOTIATING
POSITION
TO
PURCHASE
A
RIGHT
WHEN
THE
ARE
COMING
OUT
I
NEED
SOMETHING
THAT
CAN
COMFORTABLY
CARRY
ADULTS
KIDS
IN
CAR
SEATS
AND
DOGS
I
CAN
PROBABLY
AFFORD
SOMETHING
IN
THE
RANGE
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
THE
SUVS
BUT
AM
NOT
SURE
THERE
ARE
ANY
THAT
ARE
DECENT
WHICH
I
CAN
AFFORD
I
THINK
THE
FORD
EXPLORER
GOT
GOOD
REVIEWS
FROM
CONSUMER
REPORTS
BUT
IS
ABOVE
MY
RANGE
THE
ISUZU
RODEO
IS
PROBABLY
IN
MY
PRICE
RANGE
BUT
I
THINK
CONSUMER
REPORTS
GAVE
IT
A
BIG
THUMBS
DOWN
CAN
ANYONE
OFFER
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
I
AM
HOPING
FOR
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
MORE
HIP
THAN
THE
TRADITIONAL
WAGON
AND
THE
SUVS
LOOK
LIKE
FUN
WE
DO
A
LOT
OF
CAMPING
TOO
VEEK
