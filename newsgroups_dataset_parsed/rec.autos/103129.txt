WRITES
HOW
ABOUT
THE
THOUSANDS
OF
KIND
TEENAGERS
WHO
VOLUNTEER
AT
LOCAL
AGENCIES
TO
HELP
CHILDREN
SENIORS
THE
HOMELESS
HEAR
HEAR
THANKS
ROBBIE
YOU
ALSO
DONT
READ
THAT
MUCH
ABOUT
VIOLENCE
AGAINST
TEENAGERS
SUCH
AS
GEORGE
BUSH
BURYING
ALIVE
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
UNARMED
IRAQI
WHO
WERE
TRYING
TO
SURRENDER
WITH
BULLDOZERS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
THINK
IT
IS
TRUE
WITHOUT
SINGLING
OUT
TEENAGERS
FOR
BLAME
THAT
VIOLENCE
IS
MORE
SOCIALLY
ACCEPTABLE
THAN
IT
USED
TO
BE
THOSE
OF
US
WHOD
LIKE
TO
DISCOURAGE
VIOLENCE
HAVE
PLENTY
OF
WORK
TO
DO
WITH
PEOPLE
OF
ALL
AGES
WELL
THIS
ISNT
THE
RIGHT
GROUP
FOR
THIS
BUT
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
VIOLENCE
IS
ANY
MORE
SOCIALLY
ACCEPTABLE
NOW
BY
ANY
MEANS
HOW
CAN
YOU
SAY
THAT
WHEN
WE
USED
TO
HAVE
OF
PISTOLTOTING
GUNSLINGERS
AS
HEROS
OR
EVEN
GANGLAND
THUGS
BEING
CONSIDERED
ROMANTIC
DO
YOU
THINK
OUR
GREAT
GRANDPARENT
GOT
YELLED
AT
BY
THEIR
PARENTS
FOR
PLAYING
COWBOYS
AND
INDIANS
I
DONT
THINK
SO
THAT
BEHAVIOR
WAS
SOMEWHAT
ENCOURAGED
BACK
THEN
IN
FACT
I
THINK
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
NOW
AND
THEN
IS
THAT
NOWADAYS
WHEN
SOME
TEENAGER
KILLS
ANOTHER
ONE
IN
A
CLASSROOM
IN
CALIFORNIA
WE
HERE
ABOUT
IT
IN
MA
THE
SAME
DAY
BACK
IN
THE
OLD
DAYS
THEYD
NEVER
HEAR
ABOUT
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
PERIOD
