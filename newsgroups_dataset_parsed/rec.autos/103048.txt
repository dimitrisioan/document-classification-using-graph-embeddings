IM
CONSIDERING
SWITCHING
TO
GEICO
INSURANCE
BUT
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THEY
DO
NOT
ASSIGN
A
SPECIFIC
AGENT
FOR
EACH
POLICY
OR
CLAIM
I
WAS
WORRIED
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
BE
A
REAL
PAIN
WHEN
YOU
MAKE
A
CLAIM
I
HAVE
ALSO
HEARD
THAT
THEY
TRY
TO
GET
RID
OF
YOU
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
ACCIDENT
IVE
READ
IN
THIS
GROUP
THAT
GEICO
HAS
FUNDED
THE
PURCHASING
OF
RADAR
GUNS
BY
POLICE
DEPTS
IM
NOT
SURE
WHERE
GEICO
HAS
PURCHASED
RADAR
GUNS
IN
SEVERAL
STATES
I
KNOW
THEY
HAVE
DONE
IT
HERE
IN
CT
I
HAVE
ALSO
HEARD
HORROR
STORIES
ABOUT
PEOPLE
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
INSURED
BY
GEICO
FOR
YEARS
AND
THEN
HAD
ACCIDENT
AND
WERE
IMMEDIATELY
DROPPED
AND
ONCE
YOUVE
BEEN
DROPPED
BY
ANY
INSRUANCE
COMPANY
YOU
BECOME
LABLED
A
HIGH
RISK
AND
END
UP
FORKING
OUT
OR
TIMES
WHAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
FOR
INSURANCE
MY
SUGGESTION
STAY
WHERE
YOU
ARE
OR
SHOP
AROUND
BUT
STAY
AWAY
FROM
GEICO
