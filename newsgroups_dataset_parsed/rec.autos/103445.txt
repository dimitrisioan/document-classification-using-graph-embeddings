understand
what

tort
option
means

it
lower
my
rates
if
i
opt
to
have
it
or
will
it
be
more
expensive

i
opt
to
have
it
what
does
it
do
for
me
in
laymans
terms
please
is
it
a
good
deal
or
should
i
ignore
it
im
not
the
type
to
sue
anyone
at
a
drop
of
the
hat
nor
am
i
the
type
to
report

lower
your
rates
