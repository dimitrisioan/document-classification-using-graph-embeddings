wheres
my
thing
writes
it
was
called
a
bricklin
bricklins
were
manufactured
in
the
with
engines
from
ford
waitaminnit
didnt
the
bricklin
have
an
pugeot
sixcylinder
or
am
i
confusing
it
with
the
delorean
i
was
sure
the
delorean
had
a
the
delorean
had
the
yucky
prv
engine
a
jointventure
between
peugout
note
spelling
renault
and
volvo
prv
this
engine
is
a
mighty
boring
piece
of
junk
with
approx
doesnt
like
revs
at
all
if
you
look
at
the
delorean
in
the
movie
back
to
the
future
you
will
note
that
they
changed
the
engine
sound
to
a
big
a
real
delorean
doesnt
sounds
half
as
good
you
will
also
note
that
every
time
they
have
to
spin
the
tires
in
the
movie
the
ground
is
all
wet
this
is
because
a
delorean
cant
make
a
burnout
on
a
dry
road
the
weak
engine
thats
mounted
over
the
rear
axle
makes
it
almost
impossible
