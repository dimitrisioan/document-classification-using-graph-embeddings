YOU
CAN
AVOID
THESE
PROBLEMS
ENTIRELY
BY
INSTALLING
AN
OIL
DRAIN
VALVE
IN
PLACE
OF
THE
BOLT
I
HAVE
ONE
ON
BOTH
OF
MY
CARS
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
NO
LEAKS
IN
MILES
COMBINED
MILES
ON
BOTH
CARS
YES
BUT
THEN
SOMEONE
WOULD
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
DRAINING
YOUR
OIL
IN
A
PARKING
LOT
ALL
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
REACH
UNDERNEATH
TURN
A
VALVE
AND
FORGET
THE
TRIP
HOME
BUT
THERE
IS
LESS
LIKELYHOOD
THEY
HAVE
A
WRENCH
WITH
THEM
I
PERSONALLY
RECOMMEND
INSTALLING
A
SPECIAL
LOCKING
DRAIN
PLUG
TO
KEEP
VANDALS
AWAY
STEVE
I
WAS
WORRIED
ABOUT
SOMEONE
STEALING
MY
OIL
ONCE
ALSO
I
FINALLY
DECIDED
TO
JUST
HAVE
MY
DRAIN
PLUG
WELDED
SHUT
IT
WORKS
GREAT
I
FIGURE
THAT
WHEN
I
ADD
THREE
OR
FOUR
QUARTS
WHEN
THE
OIL
LIGHT
COMES
ON
EVERY
MONTH
OR
SO
THAT
ITS
JUST
AS
GOOD
OR
BETTER
THAN
THE
OLD
WIVES
TALE
OF
CHANGING
THE
OIL
AND
FILTER
EVERY
MILES
WORKS
FOR
ME
I
MUST
SAY
