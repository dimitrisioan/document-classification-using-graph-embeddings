RE
WHAT
CAR
IS
THIS
THE
BRICKLIN
WAS
A
CAR
MANUFACTURED
BY
A
COMPANY
STARTED
BY
MALCOLM
BRICKLIN
WHO
I
BELIEVE
WAS
CANADIAN
HE
WAS
THE
FIRST
ONE
TO
IMPORT
SUBARUS
AND
LATER
WAS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IMPORTING
YUGOS
I
BELIEVE
ANYWAY
HE
HAD
THIS
IDEA
THAT
WHAT
WOULD
REALLY
SELL
WOULD
BE
A
SPORTS
CAR
BUT
ONE
INCORPORATING
A
BUNCH
OF
INNOVATIVE
SAFETY
FEATURES
THE
BRICKLIN
WAS
BUILT
TO
BE
THAT
QUEEREST
OF
BEASTS
THE
SAFETY
SPORTS
CAR
IF
ANY
OF
YOU
REMEMBER
THE
EARLY
MOVEMENT
AMONG
CAR
MAKERS
TO
DESIGN
EXPERIMENTAL
SAFETY
CARS
YOU
WILL
RECOGNIZE
THE
GENERAL
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
BRICKLIN
BIG
OL
BUMPERS
ETC
ANYONE
RECALL
OTHER
SAFETY
FEATURES
THE
ENGINE
WAS
AN
AMERICAN
FORD
I
THINK
IS
RIGHT
PERSONALLY
I
KINDA
LIKE
THE
WAY
THEY
LOOK
AND
IF
I
REMEMBER
FROM
THE
OLD
MAGAZINE
ARTICLES
THE
PERFORMANCE
WAS
ONLY
HALFBAD
THE
CHOICE
OF
COLORS
THOUGH
TENDED
TOWARDS
THE
LIME
GREEN
YECH
BUT
HIGHLY
VISIBLE
I
SUPPOSE
THE
DELOREAN
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WAS
A
DOG
NICE
LOOKING
IMO
BUT
NO
MOTOR
AT
ALL
