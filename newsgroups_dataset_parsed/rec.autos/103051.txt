dirty
diesels
i
heard
the
diesels
are
considered
cleanerburning
than
gas
engines
because
the
emit
less
of
carbon
monoxide
hydrocarbons
and
oxides
of
nitrogen
co
hc
nox
but
they
can
put
out
a
lot
of
particulate
matter
i
heard
something
about
legislation
being
discussed
to
clean
up
diesel
emissions
is
there
anything
in
the
works
to
install
scrubbers
for
diesels
how
about
the
feasibility
of
installing
them
on
trucks
and
cars
would
it
be
any
different
than
a
catylitic
converter
id
assume
easier
since
were
removing
particulate
matter
instead
of
converting
gasses
lets
hear
peoples
opinions
