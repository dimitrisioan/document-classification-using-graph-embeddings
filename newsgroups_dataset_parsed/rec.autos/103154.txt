WELL
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
KIND
OF
LOCKING
LUGNUTS
YOU
HAVE
MY
PREVIOUS
CAR
HAD
LOCKING
LUGNUTS
THAT
WEIGHED
ABOUT
MORE
THAN
THE
OTHERS
THE
LOCKING
LUGNUTS
WERE
FACTORY
EQUIPMENT
AND
ACCORDING
TO
THE
FACTORY
SERVICE
MANUAL
AFTER
TIRE
BALANCING
THE
TECHNICIANMECHANIC
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
PUT
A
OZ
COUNTERWEIGHT
ON
THE
RIM
OPPOSITE
THE
LOCKING
NUT
I
ALWAYS
HAD
VIBRATION
PROBLEMS
WITH
THOSE
STUPID
LUGNUTS
SINCE
NO
ONE
EVER
DID
THE
SERVICE
CORRECTLY
I
EVENTUALLY
GOT
RID
OF
THE
LOCKING
LUGNUTS
AND
REPLACED
THEM
WITH
THE
STANDARD
LUGNUTS
UNFORTUNATELY
I
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
THE
COUNTERWEIGHTING
TECHNIQUE
MONTHS
AFTER
I
GOT
RID
OF
THE
LOCKING
NUTS
MY
PRESENT
CAR
A
SATURN
SC
HAS
LOCKING
LUGNUTS
THAT
I
BOUGHT
AT
THE
DEALER
AND
ARE
MADE
SPECIFICALLY
FOR
THE
SATURN
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
TO
BE
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
WEIGHT
AS
THE
NONLOCKING
LUGNUTS
SAID
SO
ON
THE
PACKAGE
AND
I
VERIFIED
IT
MYSELF
I
HAVENT
HAD
ANY
VIBRATION
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
TIRES
AT
ALL
DUE
TO
THE
NUTS
IN
OF
OWNERSHIP
I
DID
HAVE
SOME
OTHER
VIBRATION
PROBLEMS
BUT
IT
WAS
DUE
TO
A
POOR
JOB
OF
TIRE
BALANCING
