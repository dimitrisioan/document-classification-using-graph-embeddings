WAGON
WHICH
I
HAVE
HEARD
IS
SOMEHOW
SLIGHTLY
FASTER
THAN
THE
COUPE
WAGON
HAS
AN
AUTOMATIC
ITS
SLOWER
COULD
BE
DUE
TO
THE
REAREND
RATIO
ALSO
USUALLY
AUTOMATICS
HAVE
DIFFERENT
REARENDS
THAN
MANUALS
FROM
MY
LIMITED
EXPERIENCE
ANYWAYS
YOULL
HAVE
FUN
LOOKING
FOR
THE
REAREND
GEARS
ON
AN
SHOTHE
TAURUS

VEHICLE
I
WENT
BACK
AND
CHECKED
THE
ARTICLE
AGAIN
THE
SHO
WAGON
IS
QUICKER
THAN
THE
SHO
AUTOMATIC
BUT
SIGNIFICANTLY
SLOWER
THAN
THE
REAL
SHO
WHY
ANYONE
WOULD
ORDER
AN
SHO
WITH
AN
AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION
IS
BEYOND
ME
IF
YOU
CANT
HANDLE
A
STICK
YOU
SHOULD
STICK
WITH
A
REGULAR
TAURUS
AND
LEAVE
THE
SHO
TO
REAL
DRIVERS
THAT
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
ARENT
REAL
DRIVERS
WHO
CANT
USE
THE
STICK
EG
DISABLED
PERSONS
BUT
THEY
ARENT
IN
ANY
POSITION
TO
USE
AN
SHO
ANYWAY
I
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
BET
THAT
IF
WE
REMOVED
THE
AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSIONS
FROM
ALL
PERFORMANCETYPE
CARS
LIKE
THE
MUSTANGS
CAMAROS
AND
THE
LIKE
WED
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
NUMBER
OF
ACCIDENTS
EACH
YEAR
AUTOS
ARE
FINE
FOR
SEDATE
LITTLE
SEDANS
BUT
THEY
HAVE
NO
BUSINESS
IN
PERFORMANCE
CARS
