re
dumbest
automotive
concepts
of
all
time
well
you
young
fellers
wont
remember
but
we
used
to
have
side
vent
front
windows
until
some
damn
bean
counter
scrapped
them
these
were
separate
triangular
windows
at
the
leading
edge
of
the
front
doors
that
pivoted
outward
at
the
rear
edge
worked
like
a
charm
yeah
i
loved
the
vent
windows
on
my
escort
hell
the
only
thing
i
liked
about
the
car
one
of
the
things
id
like
to
see
brought
back
does
anyone
know
if
theyre
an
option
on
the
new
escorts
trh
