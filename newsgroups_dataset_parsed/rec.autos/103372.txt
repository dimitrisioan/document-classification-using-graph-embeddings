I
WAS
RECENTLY
THUMBING
THROUGH
THE
LEMONAID
NEW
CAR
GUIDE
WHAT
I
FOUND
WAS
A
CAR
WOULD
BE
GIVEN
A
RECOMMENDED
UNDER
THE
PICTURE
WHILE
A
FEW
SENTENCES
LATER
NOTING
HOW
A
DRIVER
AND
PASSENGER
WERE
VIRTUALLY
GUARANTEED
TO
BE
KILLED
IN
A
FRONT
END
COLLISION
THE
MOST
HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED
SMALL
CAR
THE
CIVIC
HAS
THE
WORST
CRASH
RATING
OF
ALL
OF
THE
SMALL
CARS
LISTED
THERE
WERE
MANY
SUCH
CASES
OF
GREAT
VEHICLES
WHERE
YOU
WOULDNT
SURVIVE
AN
ACCIDENT
IS
IT
ONLY
ME
OR
IS
SAFETY
NOT
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
FACTORS
WHEN
BUYING
A
CAR
IMHO
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
REDUCE
RISK
WHEN
OPERATING
A
VEHICLE
IS
BEING
ABLE
TO
AVOID
HAZARDS
AND
FOR
THAT
REASON
MY
PREFERRED
VEHICLE
IS
A
MOTORCYCLE
WHEN
I
DO
USE
A
FOUR
WHEELER
MY
PRIMARY
REASONS
ARE
IT
WILL
KEEP
ME
DRY
IT
WILL
KEEP
ME
WARM
OR
IT
WILL
CARRY
MORE
CARGO
IF
THE
FOUR
WHEELER
HAS
AS
MUCH
COLLISION
PROTECTION
AS
THE
AVERAGE
MOTORCYCLE
THEN
IT
HAS
ENOUGH
FORM
ME
HOW
DO
YOU
DEFINE
SAFE
ONE
DEFINITION
OF
SAFE
IS
WITHOUT
RISK
IS
CHAS
DOD
OH
HOW
CAN
YOU
BE
IN
TWO
PLACES
AT
ONCE
WHEN
YOURE
NOT
ANYWHERE
AT
ALL
