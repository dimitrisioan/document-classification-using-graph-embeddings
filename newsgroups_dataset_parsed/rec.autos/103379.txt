PERRY
WRITES
HARDLY
A
GOOD
REASON
MOST
US
CARS
DO
TOO
AND
PLENTY
OF
PEOPLE
BUY
THEM
IN
THE
US
ANYWAY
I
THINK
THE
IS
QUITE
A
GOOD
LOOKING
CAR
UNLIKE
THE
US
INFLUENCED

I
DONT
THINK
ITS
SO
EASY
TO
TELL
THE
FROM
ANY
OTHER
OR
SERIES
UNLESS
YOU
LOOK
REAL
CLOSE
I
REALLY
DO
THINK
VOLVOS
ARE
ALL
DOGS
THOUGH
BEACUSE
THEY
ARE
WHILE
PREVIOUS
VOLVOS
HAVE
BEEN
ESSENTIALLY
VERY
FAST
TRACTORS
THE
AND
SERIES
ARE
FAR
FROM
AGRICULTURAL
IN
DESIGN
OR
EXECUTION
HOW
MANY
FWD
TRACTORS
HAVE
YOU
SEEN
GODLIER
THAN
THOU
ADVERTISING
YOU
STATE
THIS
LIKE
IT
IS
A
BAD
THING
REMEMBER
CAR
COMPANIES
USE
AD
AGENCIES
THEY
DONT
DO
THEIR
OWN
ADS
PART
OF
RENAULT
IS
THIS
TRUE
I
KNOW
THAT
THEY
HAD
DONE
JOINT
VENTURES
WITH
RENAULT
BUT
I
HAVENT
HEARD
ABOUT
THEIR
SUBSUMPTION
INTO
RENAULT
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
THE
FRENCH
GOVERNMENT
NOW
OWNS
VOLVO
ANYWAY
RENAULT
MAKES
SOME
VERY
NICE
CARS
THEY
JUST
DONT
SELL
EM
IN
N
AMERICA
HOWEVER
ONE
THING
THAT
I
DO
THINK
IS
IN
THEIR
FAVOUR
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
IMMEDIATELY
RECOGNISABLE
AS
A
VOLVO
AND
THAT
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
YOU
CAN
SAY
ABOUT
MOST
JAPANESE
MANUFACTURERS
AND
FORD
SAAB
ALSO
HAVE
A
STRONG
CORPARATE
LOOK
WHICH
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
IS
WHAT
I
THING
ALL
CAR
MAKERS
COULD
AIM
FOR
TO
MAKE
LIFE

LITTLE
