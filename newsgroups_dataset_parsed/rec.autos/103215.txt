i
bought
a
set
of
ares
a
few
months
back
and
decided
to
add
locks
so
that
i
could
keep
my
new
rims
i
havent
had
a
balance
problem
yet
so
i
assume
that
it
might
be
just
particular
to
your
type
of
stock
nuts
my
rims
were
balanced
with
new
bfg
tas
at
a
speed
shop
to
the
finest
setting
on
their
bal
machine
so
that
helps
too
