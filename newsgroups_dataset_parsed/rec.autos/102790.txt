waxing
a
new
car
i
have
just
taken
delivery
on
a
new
gm
car
firebird
with
a
clearcoat
finish
i
assume
that
it
is
probably
urethane
since
the
industry
has
moved
in
that
direction
in
paints
in
years
past
it
used
to
be
recommended
that
owners
wait
up
to
days
before
you
wax
a
car
for
the
paint
to
cure
the
dealer
shop
manager
said
this
also
but
im
not
sure
that
he
wasnt
just
basing
it
on
past
tradition
does
anyone
know
if
this
is
still
a
recommended
practice
or
is
it
better
to
go
ahead
and
wax
right
away
nonabrasive
new
car
wax
with
the
newer
finishes
