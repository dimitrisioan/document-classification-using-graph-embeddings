WRITES

DONNA
MARTZ
WRITES
STUFF
DELETED
EXCUSE
ME
BUT
I
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
MR
SMITH
MEANT
AND
I
HAVE
OFTEN
OBSERVED
WHEN
TRAFFIC
IS
BLOCKED
SOLID
THAT
IF
A
FEW
PEOPLE
YEILD
TO
THE
MORON
WHO
IS
IMPATIENTLY
RIDING
BUMPERS
THE
SLUG
AT
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
PACK
WILL
MIRACULOUSLY
WAKE
UP
CHANGE
LANES
AND
VIOLA
NO
MORE
JAM
GRANTED
THE
SITUATION
HERE
DOES
NOT
APPLY
TO
RUSH
HOUR
IN
A
CROWDED
CITY
BUT
I
HAVE
OBSERVED
THIS
SITUATION
REGULARLY
ON
YOUR
AVERAGE
INTERSTATE
SIX
OR
EIGHT
SETS
OF
CARS
SIDE
BY
SIDE
BUNCHED
UP
IN
A
PACK
WITH
OPEN
FREEWAY
FORE
AND
AFT
AS
FAR
AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
REFUSE
TO
YEILD
AS
A
POINT
OF
HONOR
ARE
JUST
AS
ANNOYING
AS
THE
SLUG
IN
THE
FRONT
I
AGREE
THAT
IF
TRAFFIC
IS
ALL
BLOCKED
UP
AND
YOU
WANT
TO
PASS
YOU
MIGHT
NOT
FEEL
LIKE
MOVING
OVER
FOR
SOMEONE
BEHIND
YOU
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
GIVE
THEM
THAT
ONE
CARLENGTH
WHEN
THEY
SHOULD
JUST
WAIT
LIKE
YOU
ARE
BUT
IF
YOURE
ONE
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
THAT
JUST
SITS
BEHIND
THE
PERSON
AND
DOESNT
FLASH
THEM
WITH
THE
HIGH
BEAMS
OR
PULL
LEFT
AND
FLASH
THEM
OR
RIDE
THEIR
BUMPER
OR
OTHERWISE
TELL
THEM
THAT
YOU
DO
IN
FACT
WANT
TO
GO
BY
AND
YOURE
NOT
JUST
DRAFTING
THEM
THEN
GET
THE
HELL
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
OF
SOMEONE
WHO
WILL
I
ESPECIALLY
HATE
IT
WHEN
YOU
FLASH
SOMEONE
AT
THE
BACK
OF
A
LINE
AND
THEY
DONT
PASS
IT
ON
SO
AFTER
IVE
FLASHED
MY
LIGHTS
AT
THE
CHAP
IN
FRONT
AND
HE
DOESNT
PASS
IT
ON
AND
FEW
IF
ANY
DO
WHAT
NEXT
ON
MAJOR
HIGHWAYS
OR
MORE
LANES
IN
EACH
DIRECTION
KEEPING
TO
THE
EXTREME
RIGHT
BLOCKS
FOLKS
WHO
ARE
ENTERING
ALSO
AS
SOMEONE
POSTED
IN
THIS
THREAD
HERE
IN
THE
DC
AREA
WE
HAVE
A
FEW
LEFT
LANE
EXITS
SOUNDS
LIKE
IF
YOU
WAIT
UNTIL
THE
LAST
MINUTE
TO
GET
IN
THE
LEFT
LANE
YOU
WONT
CAUSE
THESE
YOYOS
WONT
MAKE
ROOM
WE
HAVE
A
PARTICULARLY
BAD
STRECH
HERE
IN
MERRYLAND
JUST
OVER
THE
CABIN
JOHN
BRIDGE
THERE
ARE
TWO
VERY
LONG
ENTRY
RAMPS
WHICH
ALL
THE
HURRYUP
YAHOOS
DIVE
INTO
CAUSE
THEY
WANT
TO
GET
AHEAD
WHEN
WE
GET
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
THESE
RAMPS
MERGE
ALL
HELL
BREAKS
LOSE
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
TRAFFIC
WHICH
WAS
MOVING
AT
ON
THE
VA
SIDE
OF
THE
BRIDGE
STALLS
ON
TOTHER
SIDE
IF
THESE
DINGBATS
HAD
STAYED
IN
LANE
ALLOWED
THE
FOLKS
COMING
UP
THE
TWO
RAMPS
TO
MERGE
WE
WOULD
STILL
BE
DOING
INSTEAD
WE
DO
START
STOP
FOR
MILES
DAVE
BARRYS
IDEA
OF
A
LASER
EQUIPPED
CAR
WOULD
BE
REAL
USEFUL
HERE
BOB
PS
IF
YOU
DRIVE
THE
BELTWAY
AND
WANT
TO
MERGE
LOOK
FOR
A
BROWN
PROBE
WITH
A
SILVER
HAIRED
DRIVER
THEN
USE
YOUR
SIGNALS
I
DONT
READ
MINDS
BUT
I
DO
TRY
TO
BE
COURTEOUS
THEY
TOLD
ME
COURTESY
WAS
CONTAGIOUS
BUT
I
GUESS
THE
FOLKS
AROUND
HERE
HAVE
HAD
THEIR
SHOTS
