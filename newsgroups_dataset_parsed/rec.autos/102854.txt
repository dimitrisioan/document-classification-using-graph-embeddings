EUROWIPER
BOOTS
I
HAVE
THE
EUROWIPER
BOOTS
IN
WHITE
AND
HAD
TO
THROW
AWAY
THE
FIRST
PAIR
SINCE
I
FOUND
NO
WAY
OF
CLEANING
THEM
AFTER
THEY
LOOKED
ALMOST
BLACK
NOW
I
HAVE
MY
SECOND
PAIR
OF
WHITE
ONES
AND
ONCE
AGAIN
THEY
ARE
DIRTY
I
NEED
A
WAY
TO
CLEAN
THEM
WO
REMOVING
THEM
SINCE
I
HAD
TO
CUT
THEM
TO
REMOVE
THEM
IS
THERE
A
WAY
OR
SHOULD
I
JUST
BUY
BLACK
ONES
