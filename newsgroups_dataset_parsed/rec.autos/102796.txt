RE
RFIART
OF
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTING
WRITES
IM
WONDERING
IF
ANYBODY
ELSE
OUT
THERE
IS
A
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTER
IVE
BEEN
DOING
IT
MY
SELF
OVER
MILES
ON
MY
CURRENT
TOYOTA
TRUCK
IVE
GOT
OVER
IVE
HEARD
PEOPLE
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
DOING
THIS
CAN
DAMAGE
A
TRANSMISSION
MY
EXPERIENCES
SUGGEST
OTHERWISE
WHAT
TECHNIQUES
DO
YOU
USE
YEAH
I
DONT
USE
THE
CLUTCH
ALL
THE
TIME
EITHER
IVE
DONE
IT
WITH
FORDS
BMW
DATSUN
AND
CHEVY
AND
IT
WORKS
FINE
I
CANT
THINK
OF
ANY
REASON
THAT
IT
WOULD
DAMAGE
THE
TRANNY
ESSENTIALLY
YOU
ARE
JUST
DOING
WHAT
THE
SYNCHROS
DO
ANYHOW
MATCH
THE
ENGINE
SPEED
WITH
THE
TRANNY
SPEED
AND
SLIP
IT
INTO
GEAR
ON
SOME
OLD
PIECES
OF
JUNK
I
DROVE
THE
TRANSMISSION
WAS
SO
WORN
THAT
PUMPING
THE
CLUTCH
WAS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
SHIFT
EXCEPT
CLUTCHLESS
TO
DATE
IVE
DRIVEN
RABBITS
DATSUNS
COMETS
FORDS
A
CHEVY
SOME
WHERE
HARDER
THAN
OTHERS
TO
SHIFT
BUT
GENERALLY
THE
HIGHER
THE
MILAGE
THE
SMOOTHER
QUICKER
EASIER
THEY
WHERE
TO
SHIFT
MY
TECHNIQUE
IS
TO
EASE
BACK
OFF
THE
THROTTLE
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
GENTLY
WRIST
BACK
ON
THE
SHIFT
LEVER
IF
FOR
SOME
REASON
I
MISS
THE
SHIFT
WINDOW
I
LIGHTLY
PRESS
THE
ACCELERATOR
TRY
AGIAN
IVE
FOUND
THAT
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTING
IS
EAISERQUICKER
AT
HIGH
RPMS
I
ALSO
SKIP
GEARS
SOME
TIMES
USING
SOUNDS
ABOUT
RIGHT
I
USUALLY
SLIP
IT
OUT
DURING
THROTTLEDOWN
AND
THEN
BLIP
THE
THROTTLE
AND
WAIT
UNTIL
IT
FEELS
LIKE
THINGS
ARE
RIGHT
USUALLY
ABOUT
A
SECOND
AND
THEN
SLIP
IT
INTO
GEAR
KRISPY
JON
YOU
OBVIOUSLY
DONT
KNOW
WHO
YOURE
DEALING
