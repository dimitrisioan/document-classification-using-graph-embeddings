MORRIS
WRITES
HEY
NISSAN
WHY
ARENT
YOU
GUYS
MAKING
ANY
STATION
WAGONS
YOU
USED
TO
MAKE
A
WAGON
ON
EVERY
PLATFORM
SENTRA
STANZA
MAXIMA
AND
NOW
NONE
AT
ALL
IN
FACT
THEY
MAKE
SOME
BUT
THEY
JUST
DONT
SELL
THEM
HERE
IN
US
SUNNY
CALIFORNIA
IS
A
WAGON
BASED
ON
SENTRA
AVENIL
IS
A
WAGON
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
INFINITY
BUT
ACTUALLY
ITS
INDEPENDENTLY
DESIGNED
TO
BE
A
WAGONI
MEAN
ITS
NOT
BASED
ON
ANY
SEDANS
NISSAN
HAD
BETTER
CONSIDER
TO
SELL
THEM
HERE
AFTER
BUYING
MY
SER
AND
REALLY
LOVING
IT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BUY
ANOTHER
NISSAN
PRODUCT
FOR
MY
WIFE
BUT
PREFER
A
WAGON
IVE
OWNED
MINIVANS
AND
DONT
PREFER
THEM
HOW
ABOUT
AN
ALTIMA
WAGON
OR
A
SENTRA
WAGON
WOULD
DO
SOUNDS
NICE
BUT
I
DOUBT
THEY
HAVE
A
PLAN
COZ
AVENIL
WAS
INTRODUCED
TO
REPLACE
ANY
SEDAN
BASED
WAGON
OR
HERES
AN
EVEN
BETTER
SUGGESTION
WHY
DONT
YOU
GUYS
GO
AHEAD
AND
BUY
THE
REST
OF
FUJI
HEAVY
INDUSTRIES
SUBARU
AND
PUT
EITHER
AN
INLINE
OR
INTO
THE
LEGACY
WAGON
ID
BUY
THE
LEGACY
IN
A
MINUTE
IF
IT
HAD
A
NISSAN
ENGINE
INSTEAD
OF
THE
HORIZONTAL
THAT
THEY
SEEM
SENTIMENTALLY
ATTACHED
TO
WITH
ALL
THE
CAMRY
ACCORD
TAURUS
VOLVO
AND
SUBARU
WAGONS
OUT
THERE
ITS
GOT
TO
BE
A
MARKET
SEGMENT
THAT
WOULD
BE
WORTHWHILE
I
CAN
WAIT
A
YEAR
OR
TWO
BUT
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
COMPETE
BY
THE
MODEL
I
MAY
HAVE
TO
GO
ELSEWHERE
