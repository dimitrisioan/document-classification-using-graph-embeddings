RE
WHAT
IS
THE
DEAL
WITH
BLUEBOOK
VALUE
OF
AN
AUTO
NEWTONCONVEXCOM
VICKI
NEWTON
WRITES
I
AM
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
BUYING
A
NEW
AUTO
I
HAVENT
DECIDED
YET
WHETHER
I
SHOULD
SELL
MY
CURRENT
CAR
MYSELF
OR
TRADE
IT
IN
AS
PART
OF
THE
NEW
AUTO
PURCHASE
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
BLUE
BOOK
VALUE
FOR
THE
CAR
IS
AN
ACQUAINTENCE
HAS
OFFERED
TO
GIVE
ME
BLUE
BOOK
VALUE
FOR
THE
CAR
I
AM
JUST
WONDERING
IF
THIS
IS
A
STANDARD
MEASURE
FOR
NEGOTIATING
A
RESALE
PRICE
OR
IF
I
CAN
HOPE
TO
GET
MORE
MONEY
FROM
SOMEONE
ELSE
WHAT
EXACTLY
IS
BLUE
BOOK
VALUE
BASED
ON
I
KNOW
THAT
FOR
ITS
YEAR
MY
CAR
HAS
LOW
MILEAGE
IT
IS
IN
EXCELLENT
WORKING
CONDITION
BUT
DOES
HAVE
A
FEW
DINGS
ON
THE
EXTERIOR
NOTHING
MAJOR
DO
ANY
OF
THESE
FACTS
ALTER
THE
FAIR
SELLING
PRICE
OF
THE
CAR
I
AM
NOT
LOOKING
TO
RIP
ANYONE
OFF
I
JUST
NATURALLY
WANT
TO
GET
THE
BEST
PRICE
FOR
THE
CAR
THANKS
A
MILLION
VEEK
I
THINK
THE
BLUE
BOOK
IS
THE
NADA
HANDBOOK
FOR
USED
CAR
PRICES
NO
IS
THE
BLUE
BOOK
VALUE
GIVEN
THE
RETAIL
OR
WHOLESALE
VALUE
THE
BLUE
BOOK
VALUE
ISNT
SET
IN
STONE
THOUGH
LOW
MILAGE
EXTRA
ADDONS
AND
STUFF
LIKE
THAT
THERE
CAN
INCREASE
THE
RESALE
PRICE
OF
THE
CAR
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
HEAD
ON
OVER
TO
THE
LOCAL
LIBRARY
OR
BORROW
YOUR
FRIENDS
BLUE
BOOK
AND
READ
UP
ON
THAT
SORT
OF
STUFF
I
PAID
UNDER
BB
RETAIL
FOR
MY
CIVIC
IN
AND
IT
WAS
IN
PERFECT
CONDITION
AND
HAD
ONLY
MILES
ON
IT
THE
GUY
WAS
DESPARATE
TO
SELL
NEW
KID
ON
THE
WAY
ETC
BUT
IT
WAS
A
GOOD
PRICE
REMEBER
BOTH
YOU
AND
THE
BUYER
IF
HE
HAS
ANY
SORT
OF
BRAINS
AT
ALL
ARE
USING
THE
BLUE
BOOK
SO
YOU
SHOULD
PICK
A
FAIR
PRICE
