CAROLINAFANUIUC
WROTE
I
HAVE
BEEN
ACTIVE
IN
DEFENDING
SATURN
LATELY
ON
THE
NET
AND
WOULD
LIKE
TO
STATE
MY
FULL
OPINION
ON
THE
SUBJECT
RATHER
THAN
JUST
REPLY
TO
OTHERS
POINTS
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEM
SOME
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
BE
HAVING
IS
THAT
SATURN
DEALERS
MAKE
ON
A
CAR
I
THINK
MOST
WILL
AGREE
WITH
ME
THAT
THE
CAR
IS
COMPARABLY
PRICED
WITH
ITS
COMPETITORS
THAT
IS
THEY
ARENT
OVERPRICED
COMPARED
TO
MOST
CARS
IN
THEIR
CLASS
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THE
POINT
OF
ARGUING
OVER
WHETHER
THE
DEALER
MAKES
THE
OR
NOT
I
HAVE
NEVER
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
THE
BIG
DEAL
OVER
DEALER
PROFITS
IS
EITHER
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
I
CAN
FIGURE
OUT
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
THEY
MINIMIZE
THE
DEALER
PROFIT
THEY
WILL
MINIMIZE
THEIR
TOTAL
OUTOFPOCKET
EXPENSES
FOR
THE
CAR
WHILE
THIS
MAY
BE
TRUE
IN
SOME
CASES
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
GENERALLY
TRUE
I
BOUGHT
A
SATURN
SL
IN
JANUARY
OF
AT
THAT
TIME
BASED
ON
STUDYING
CAR
PRICES
I
DECIDED
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
COMPARABLE
CAR
THAT
WAS
PRICED
AS
CHEAPLY
AS
THE
SATURN
SURE
MAYBE
I
COULD
HAVE
TALKED
THE
PRICE
FOR
SOME
OTHER
CAR
TO
THE
SATURN
PRICE
BUT
MY
OUTOFPOCKET
EXPENSES
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
ANY
DIFFERENT
WHATS
IMPORTANT
TO
ME
IS
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
I
HAVE
LEFT
AFTER
I
BUY
THE
CAR
REDUCING
DEALER
PROFIT
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
THING
AS
SAVING
MONEY
SHOW
ME
HOW
REDUCING
DEALER
PROFIT
SAVES
ME
MONEY
AND
ILL
BELIEVE
THAT
ITS
IMPORTANT
MY
EXPERIENCE
HAS
BEEN
THAT
REDUCING
DEALER
PROFIT
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
SAVE
ME
MONEY
FRED
SAY
YOU
BOUGHT
YOUR
SATURN
AT
WITH
A
DEALER
PROFIT
OF
IF
THE
DEALER
PROFIT
IS
THEN
YOU
WOULD
ONLY
BE
PAYING
FOR
THE
SAME
CAR
SO
ISNT
THAT
SAVING
MONEY
MOREOVER
IF
SATURN
REALLY
DOES
REDUCE
THE
DEALER
PROFIT
MARGIN
BY
THEN
THEIR
CARS
WILL
BE
EVEN
BETTER
DEALS
SAY
IF
THE
PRICE
OF
A
SATURN
WAS
ALREADY
BELOW
MARKET
AVERAGE
FOR
THE
CLASS
OF
CARS
THEN
AFTER
THEY
REDUCE
THE
DEALER
PROFIT
IT
WOULD
BE
BELOW
MARKET
AVERAGE
IT
WILL
ATTRACT
EVEN
MORE
PEOPLE
TO
BUY
SATURNS
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
SAVE
THEM
MONEY
FORCE
THE
COMPETITORS
TO
LOWER
THEIR
PRICES
TO
SURVIVE
NOW
NOT
ONLY
WILL
SATURN
OWNERS
BENEFIT
FROM
A
LOWER
DEALER
PROFIT
EVEN
THE
BUYERS
FOR
OTHER
CARS
WILL
PAY
LESS
ISNT
THAT
SAVING
MONEY
