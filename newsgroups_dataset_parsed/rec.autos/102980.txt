STUFF
DELETED
BACK
TO
THE
STUFF
FOR
A
SECOND
NOTE
THAT
THE
AUTO
TRANNY
IN
STILL
SHIFTS
AT
THE
DRIVERS
COMMAND
NOT
SOME
PRESELECTED
SCHEDULE
THE
DRIVER
STILL
CONTROLS
THE
SHIFTING
NOT
THE
TRANSMISSION
NOW
THERE
IS
NO
DISPUTE
THAT
IN
PRODUCTION
CARS
AUTOMATICS
ARE
INHERENTLY
MORE
LOSSY
THAN
MANUALS
THAT
IS
IN
THEORY
MY
POINT
ALL
ALONG
IS
THAT
WHATEVER
MECHANICAL
ADVANTAGES
A
MANUAL
HAS
OVER
AN
AUTOMATIC
CAN
VERY
EASILY
BE
LOST
BY
A
DRIVER
WHO
ISNT
SKILLFUL
OR
ONE
THING
THAT
GIVES
AN
AUTOMATIC
AN
ADVANTAGE
AT
LAUNCH
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
HAS
A
TORQUE
CONVERTER
VS
A
CLUTCH
I
KNOW
THIS
SOUNDS
STRANGE
BUT
A
TORQUE
CONVERTER
MULTIPLIES
THE
ENGINE
OUTPUT
WHEN
LAUNCHING
IT
FUNCTIONS
AS
A
SORT
OF
LIMITED
CONTINUOUSLY
VARIABLE
TRANSMISSION
TYPICALLY
YOU
GET
A
TORQUE
MULTIPLICATION
OF
TO
TIMES
DEPENDING
ON
THE
STALL
SPEED
I
HAVE
YET
TO
SEE
A
TORQUE
MULTIPLIER
INSTALLED
ON
A
PRODUCTION
AUTOMOBILE
SUCH
SYSTEMS
DO
EXIST
BUT
NONE
ARE
PRESENTLY
INSTALLED
IN
PRODUCTION
AUTOS
THAT
I
AM
AWARE
OF
THESE
ARE
COMMONLY
CALLED
VISCOUS
DRIVE
CVTS
OR
FLUIDIC
AMPLIFIERS
CONTRASTED
TO
A
CLUTCH
WHICH
MERELY
SLIPS
WHEN
FEATHERED
RESULT
IS
NO
TQ
MULT
WHAT
THE
CONVERTOR
DOES
ALLOW
IS
FOR
THE
ENGINE
TO
BE
CLOSER
TO
ITS
TORQUE
PEAK
DURING
THE
LAUNCH
BEFORE
A
CLUTCHED
CAR
CAN
FULLY
ENGAGE
ITS
DRIVELINE
CHEVY
PROVED
IT
MANY
YEARS
AGO
WITH
THE
CAMARO
ETS
AND
TERMINAL
MILE
TIMES
WERE
CLOSE
ENOUGH
TPO
BE
IDENTICAL
FOR
SPEED
AND
AUTO
CARS
NOTE
THAT
THIS
IS
ALSO
THE
MAJOR
REASON
THAT
AN
AUTO
CAR
CAN
GET
AWAY
WITH
FEWER
GEARS
THAN
A
MANUAL
THE
SLIP
IN
THE
CONVERTOR
MAKES
UP
FOR
THE
FEWER
RATIOS
AND
BEFORE
EVERYONE
STARTS
YELLING
ABOUT
THE
PROPOSED
SSPEED
AUTOS
SOON
TO
BE
OUT
NOTE
THAT
SOME
MANUFACTURERS
ARE
USING
SPEED
MANULAS
NOW
ONCE
PAST
LAUCH
HOWEVER
THE
CONVERTER
BEGINS
COUPLING
AND
THE
TQ
MULTIPLICATION
EFFECT
IS
REDUCED
