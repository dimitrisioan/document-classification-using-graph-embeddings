while
a
few
sentences
later
noting
how
a
driver
and
passenger
were
virtually
guaranteed
to
be
killed
in
a
front
end
collision
the
most
highly
recommended
small
car
the
civic
has
the
worst
crash
rating
of
all
of
the
small
cars
listed
there
were
many
such
cases
of
great
vehicles
where
you
wouldnt
survive
an
accident

it
