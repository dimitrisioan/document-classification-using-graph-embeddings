i
was
curious
as
to
what
people
thought
of
the
vw
corrado
thats
about
it
outatime
it
hauls
butt
handles
nice
but
is
junk
i
drove
a
brand
new
one
for
a
day
as
a
loaner
the
key
was
already
rustingseems
they
stamp
their
keys
out
of
potmetal
all
the
controls
seemed
really
junkclutch
was
heavy
door
locks
power
buttons
sunroof
controls
etc
seemed
really
cheap
no
way
i
would
pay
for
this
baby
no
airbag
either
i
also
drove
a
svx
for
a
daystickered
at
but
going
out
the
door
for
much
better
buy
imo
although
it
is
more
of
a
sports
touring
couperoomy
etc
the
corrado
is
more
of
a
small
sports
car
the
ergonomics
and
leather
in
the
svx
was
twice
as
nice
as
the
corrados
both
had
smooth
strong
engines
