ashtrays
and
cigarette
lighters
these
should
be
an
option
you
forget
that
the
cigarette
lighter
plug
is
essential
for
plugging
in
radar
detectors
and
lights
the
ashtrays
are
also
essential
because
they
are
great
places
to
keep
change
and
tokens
wouldnt
you
rather
have
some
type
of
standard
electrical
plug
instead
of
that
fire
hazard
waiting
to
happen
adaptor
i
know
i
would
and
i
would
also
prefer
to
have
sensibly
placed
cup
holders
instead
of
an
ashtray
my
car
came
with
coin
holders
already
built
in
ron
