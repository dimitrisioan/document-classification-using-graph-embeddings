q
dings
in
the
paint
on
my
hood
hello
i
have
a
toyota
and
in
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
been
getting
quite
a
few
dings
in
the
paint
on
the
hood
from
rocks
and
debris
off
of
the
road
i
have
never
had
any
major
problems
with
other
cartrucks
in
the
past
maybe
a
ding
once
in
a
while
i
went
to
the
dealer
and
he
said
that
it
happens
all
of
the
time
and
he
recomended
putting
a
bug
deflector
on
the
hood
he
said
that
the
trucks
for
some
unknown
reason
seem
to
have
this
problem
more
than
some
cars
it
seems
to
me
that
either
my
luck
is
really
bad
or
there
might
be
a
problem
with
the
paint
painted
on
a
monday
morning
perhaps
how
well
do
these
bug
deflectors
work
for
small
road
debris
on
trucks
if
anyone
has
any
experiencessuggestions
please
let
me
know
thanks
