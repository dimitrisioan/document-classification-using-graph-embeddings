SUNDANCEDODGE
SHADOW
EXPERIENCES
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
SOME
LEMONS
ARE
OUT
THERE
BUT
FROM
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
MY
BROTHERS
HAS
BEEN
TROUBLE
FREE
NOT
ONE
SINGLE
REPAIR
ONLY
REGULAR
MAINTAINANCE
THE
ONLY
WORK
HE
HAD
DONE
ON
IT
WAS
A
RESULT
OF
HIS
STUPIDITY
HE
STOPPED
SUDDENLY
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
LEFT
TURN
ON
A
BUSY
INTERSECTION
AND
WAS
REARENDED
HE
HAS
A
PLYMOUTH
SUNDANCE
I
WOULD
RECOMEND
IT
BUT
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
SAY
THAT
IF
YOU
CAN
WAIT
ABOUT
SIX
MONTHS
CHRYCO
IS
COMING
OUT
WITH
A
NEW
CAR
CALLED
THE
NEON
THAT
IS
BUILT
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
AS
THE
LHS
WHERE
GOOD
LUCK
WITH
YOUR
DESISCION
