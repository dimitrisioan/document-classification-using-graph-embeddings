I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
TWENTIES
WE
PROBABLY
DROVE
MOSTLY
DOWN
CATTLE
TRAILS
AND
IN
WAGON
RUTS
I
AM
FAIRLY
SURE
THAT
PLACEMENT
OF
THE
STEERING
WHEEL
WAS
PRETTY
MUCH
ARBITRARY
TO
THE
COMPANY
AT
THAT
TIME
BY
THE
THERE
WAS
A
VERY
ACTIVE
GOOD

HAD
ITS

CONVINCED

THAT
GOOD
RAODS
WERE
CRUCIAL
TO
OUR
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
ANYWAY
BY
THE
THERE
WERE
PLENTY
OF
GOOD
ROADS
AT
LEAST
AROUND
URBAN
AREAS
AND
THEY
WERE
RAPIDLY
EXPANDING
INTO
THE
COUNTRYSIDE

THEY
DONT

THERE
HUH
I
JUST
ALWAYS
RECALL
THINKING
THAT
GOOD
ROADS
OF

DIDNT
COME
AROUND
TIL
THE
INTERSTATE
HIWAY
ACT
OR
WHATEVER
THEY
CALLED
AND
THAT

ROADS
WERE
FAIRLY
RARE
UP
THROUGH
THE
DEPRESSION
EXCEPT
IN
OVERPOPULATED
PLACES
LIKE
ENGLAND
AND
US
CITIES
OBVIOUSLY
NETWISDOM
SAYS
I
AM
WRONG
AS
TO
PLACEMENT
OF
THE
STEERING
WHEEL
BEING
ARBITRARY
BY
THE
EARLY
TEENS
THERE
WERE
VIRTUALLY
NO
AMERICAN
CARS
THAT
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
WHEEL
ON
THE
LEFT
IN
THE
EARLY
DAYS
CARS
HAD
THE
WHEEL
ON
THE
LEFT
ON
THE
RIGHT
AND
EVEN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AS
WELL
AS
SOMETIMES
HAVING
A
TILLER
INSTEAD
OF
A
WHEEL
THIS
WAS
STANDARDIZED
FAIRLY
EARLY
ON
THOUGH
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
I
KNEW
IT
WAS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
DONE
BUT
I
KNEW
OF
NO
REASON
THAT
IT
MIGHT
NOT
BE
DONE
THE
OTHER
WAY
BY
DESOTO
FOR
THEIR
CAR
SEEMS
LIKE
THEY
HAD
SOME
OTHER
DEVIATIONS
FROM
THE
