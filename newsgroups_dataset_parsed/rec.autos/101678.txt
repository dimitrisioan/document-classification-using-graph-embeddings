apology
was
re
did
us
drive
on
the
left
from
andrew
a
spencer
in
a
previous
article
daniel
u
holbrook
says
im
guessing
but
i
believe
in
the
twenties
we
probably
drove
mostly
down
cattle
trails
and
in
wagon
ruts
i
am
fairly
sure
that
placement
of
the
steering
wheel
was
pretty
much
arbitrary
to
the
company
at
that
time
by
the
there
was
a
very
active
good
roads
movement
which
had
its
origins
actually
in
the
during
the
bicycle
craze
picked
up
steam
in
the
teens
witness
the
linclon
highway
association
or
so
and
the
us
highway
support
act
real
name
something
different
in
that
first
pledged
federal
aid
to
states
and
counties
to
build
decent
roads
also
the
experience
of
widespread
use
of
trucks
for
domestic
transport
during
ww
convinced
the
government
that
good
raods
were
crucial
to
our
national
defense
anyway
by
the
there
were
plenty
of
good
roads
at
least
around
urban
areas
and
they
were
rapidly
expanding
into
the
countryside
this
was
the
era
after
all
of
the
first
auto
touring
fad
the
motel
the
auto
camp
ground
etc

raes
auto
histories
im
sorry
as
i
have
never
heard
of
any
of
this
guess
they
dont
think
its
important
enough
for
a
classroom
and
i
was
going
on
what
ive
seen
in
picssome
moviesreal
nice
scource
there
huh
i
just
always
recall
thinking
that
good
roads
of
asphalt
didnt
come
around
til
the
interstate
hiway
act
or
whatever
they
called
and
that
wood
and
cobblestone
roads
were
fairly
rare
up
through
the
depression
except
in
overpopulated
places
like
england
and
us
cities
obviously
netwisdom
says
i
am
wrong
as
to
placement
of
the
steering
wheel
being
arbitrary
by
the
early
teens
there
were
virtually
no
american
cars
that
did
not
have
the
wheel
on
the
left
in
the
early
days
cars
had
the
wheel
on
the
left
on
the
right
and
even
in
the
middle
as
well
as
sometimes
having
a
tiller
instead
of
a
wheel
this
was
standardized
fairly
early
on
though
i
dont
know
why
i
knew
it
was
almost
always
done
but
i
knew
of
no
reason
that
it
might
not
be
done
the
other
way
by
desoto
for
their
car
seems
like
they
had
some
other
deviations
from
the
norm
too
at
times
