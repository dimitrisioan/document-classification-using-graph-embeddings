this
happened
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
the
girls
ok
actually
and
she
recovered
well
enough
to
go
home
i
dont
know
if
she
has
any
permanent
damage
though
just
in
case
anybody
was
concerned
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of
ours
i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off
of
bridges
and
such
but
pound
rocks
has
our
society
really
stooped

low

if
people
start
forcing
others
to
take
responsibility
for
their
actions
things
like
this
wouldnt
happen
untill
we
stop
blaming
outside
causes
and
start
blaming
the
criminals
we
will
continue
to
let
things
like
this
happen
