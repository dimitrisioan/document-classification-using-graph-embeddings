RE
WAXING
A
NEW
CAR
I
JUST
HAD
MY
CHRYSLER
PAINTED
I
WAS
TOLD
TO
REFRAIN
FROM
WAXING
IT
AND
TO
LEAVE
IT
OUT
IN
THE
SUN
SUPPOSEDLY
THIS
LETS
THE
VOLATILES
ESCAPE
FROM
THE
PAINT
OVER
A
MONTH
OR
SO
I
CAN
SMELL
IT
FEET
AWAY
ON
A
HOT
DAY
AND
LETS
ANY
SLIGHT
IRREGULARITES
IN
THE
SURFACE
FLOW
OUT
AS
THE
PAINT
REMAINS
A
LITTLE
SOFT
FOR
A
WHILE
