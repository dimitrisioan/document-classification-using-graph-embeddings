JOHN
G
KISSANE
WRITES
AS
A
MATTER
OF
INTEREST
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHY
AUTOS
ARE
SO
POPULAR
IN
THE
US
WHILE
HERE
IN
EUROPE
THEY
ARE
RARE
JUST
WONDERING
IN
MANY
OF
OUR
CITIES
THERE
ARE
TRAFFIC
SIGNALS
EVERY
FEET
UNSYNCHRONISED
OF
COURSE
WELL
HERE
IN
OTTAWA
ANYWAY
AND
THE
ROADS
ARE
SO
CONGESTED
THAT
SHIFTING
MANUALLY
IS
A
REAL
PAIN
IN
THE
LEFT
FOOT
ALSO
MOST
CANADIANS
ARE
TOO
STUPID
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
SHIFT
MANUALLY
GEE
I
GOTTA
COORDINATE
MY
TWO
FEET
ON
THE
CLUTCH
BRAKE
AND
ACCELERATOR
AND
I
GOTTA
STEER
SHIFT
AND
OPERATE
THE
SIGNALS
OPTIONAL
AND
RADIO
WITH
MY
TWO
HANDS
DUH
IT
I
AGREE
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
CANT
BE
DONE
ALSO
MOST
NORTH
AMERICAN
MADE
CARS
COME
WITH
THE
AUTOMATIC
AS
STANDARD
EQUIPMENT
SO
WHY
BOTHER
WITH
A
MANUAL
WHEN
THE
CAR
CAN
SHIFT
FOR
YOU
FOR
NO
ADDITION
MONEY
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THERE
IN
CA
BUT
HERE
IN
US
THE
MANUALS
ARE
QUITE
OFTEN
THE
STANDARD
EQUIPMENT
OF
COURSE
FINDING
A
CAR
WITH
ONE
MIGHT
BE
HARD
BUT
IF
YOU
READ
THE
STICKER
ON
THE
WINDOW
THERE
IS
USALLY
AN
ADDITIONAL
OR
SO
TACKED
ON
FOR
THAT
LOUSY
TRANNY
SO
YOU
ACTUALLY
ARE
PAYING
MORE
JUST
THAT
ITS
SOMETIMES
HARD
TO
FIND
ONE
THAT
IS
EQUIPPED
STANDARD
THIS
APPLIES
TO
MOST
CARS
BUT
NOT
TO
THE
LUXOYACHTSEG
CADDILAC
LICOLNS
ETC
DREW
