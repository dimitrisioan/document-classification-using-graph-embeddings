re
car
buying
story
was
christ
another
dealer
service
scam
in
article
writes
before
you
go
in
find
out
the
invoice
prices
of
the
car
add
a
reasonable
profit
for
the
dealer
offer
them
that
price
and
stick
to
it
whoa
watch
your
terminology
dealer
invoice
is
not
dealer
cost
youll
hear
lots
of
ads
screaming
two
dollars
over
dealer
invoice
sounds
like
a
real
deal
huh
no
you
know
what
the
dealer
invoice
also
called
factory
invoice
is
its
a
piece
of
paper
with
numbers
on
it
that
the
factory
sends
the
dealer
what
do
the
numbers
signify
absolutely
nothing
its
a
marketing
gimmick
that
the
salesman
can
wave
in
your
face
to
impress
you
note
that
nowhere
on
the
invoice
does
it
claim
to
be
the
real
price
of
the
car
and
most
ads
which
mention
dealer
invoice
will
end
with
a
very
fast
low
voice
saying
something
like
invoice
may
not
reflect
actual
dealer
cost
actually
i
guarantee
it
does
not
reflect
actual
dealer
cost
also
the
reasonable
profit
for
dealer
is
usually
around
three
percent
adjust
according
to
the
dealer
cost
of
the
car
and
any
options
that
you
want
haggle
like
hell
with
the
salesman
over
the
cost
of
dealer
prep
and
protection
package
ie
a
few
squirts
of
paint
and
fabric
protectant
while
youre
at
it
ask
the
salesman
to
toss
in
a
thing
or
two
that
doesnt
cost
him
any
cash
my
wife
and
i
got
a
joyride
in
a
twinturbo
mitsubishi
when
we
bought
our
mitsubishi
minivan
