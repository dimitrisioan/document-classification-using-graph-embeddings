RE
HONDA
CLUTCH
CHATTER
I
ALSO
EXPERIENCE
THIS
KINDA
PROBLEM
IN
MY
BMW
DURING
COLD
START
UPS
THE
CLUTCH
SEEMS
TO
BE
STICKY
AND
EVERYTIME
I
DRIVE
OUT
FOR
ABOUT
THE
CLUTCH
SEEMS
TO
STICK
ONTO
SOMEWHERE
THAT
IF
I
DEPRESS
THE
CLUTCH
THE
WHOLE
CHASSIS
MOVES
ALONG
BUT
AFTER
PREHEATING
IT
BECOMES
SMOOTH
AGAIN
I
THINK
THAT
YOUR
SUGGESTION
OF
BEING
SOME
HUMUDITY
IS
RIGHT
BUT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
SOME
REMEDY
I
ALSO
FOUND
OUT
THAT
MY
CLUTCH
IS
ALREADY
THIN
BUT
STILL
ALRIGHT
FOR
A
COUPLE
GRAND
MORE
