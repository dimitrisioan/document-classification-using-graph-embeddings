JEFFREY
HOFFMEISTER
WRITES
MY
SUGGESTION
STAY
WHERE
YOU
ARE
OR
SHOP
AROUND
BUT
STAY
AWAY
FROM
GEICO
I
STRONGLY
AGREE
WITH
JEFF
HERES
MY
HORROR
STORY
MANY
YEARS
BACK
I
SWITCHED
TO
GEICO
FROM
STATE
FARM
TO
SAVE
SOME
I
HAVE
A
RELATIVELY
NEW
SPORTS
CAR
FOR
WHICH
WE
COVERED
WITH
LIABILITY
COLLISION
AND
COMPREHENSIVE
WITH
THIS
MAKE
OF
CAR
NEW
MODELS
CAME
OUT
IN
JANUARY
NOT
SEPTEMBER
LIKE
OTHER
MAKES
THE
CAR
WAS
PURCHASED
IN
AUGUST
OF
THAT
YEAR
WE
ALSO
HAD
A
MUCH
OLDER
CLUNKER
FOR
WHICH
WE
ONLY
WANTED
LIABILITY
LOW
AND
BEHOLD
A
VANDAL
SLASHED
THE
ROOF
OF
THE
SPORTS
CAR
AND
WE
PUT
IN
A
CLAIM
THIS
WAS
IN
OCTOBER
STILL
THE
CURRENT
MODEL
YEAR
FOR
THE
CAR
A
NEW
TOP
WITH
INSTALLATION
WAS
WE
HAD
DEDUCTIBLE
SO
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
YOU
HAD
TO
GO
TO
GEICOS
LOCAL
OFFICE
TO
HAVE
AN
ADJUSTER
SEE
THE
CAR
UNLIKE
STATE
FARM
THAT
SENT
THE
ADJUSTERS
TO
THE
SHOP
OR
YOUR
PLACE
HE
SAID
SINCE
THE
CAR
IS
NOW
ONE
YEAR
OLD
WELL
DEPRECIATE
THE
TOP
BY
SO
YOULL
GET
ON
THE
CLAIM
THIS
WILL
ALSO
COUNT
AS
AN
ACCIDENT
AGAINST
YOU
SO
YOUR
RATE
MAY
INCREASE
THE
HASSLE
CONTINUED
THEN
WE
GOT
A
LETTER
FROM
GEICO
SAYING
CLAIM
DENIED
YOUR
POLICY
ON
THIS
CAR
DOESNT
COVER
THIS
I
THEN
LEARNED
THAT
THEIR
RECORDS
HAD
THE
FULL
COVERAGE
COLLISION
ETC
ON
OUR
OLD
CLUNKER
AND
ONLY
HAD
LIABILITY
FOR
THIS
NEW
CAR
THEY
MIXED
UP
OUR
CARS
IN
THEIR
RECORDS
I
FIXED
THE
TOP
MYSELF
WITH
SOME
CARPET
THREAD
AND
DROPPED
MY
CLAIM
THEY
STILL
CHARGED
ME
WITH
AN
ACCIDENT
I
CANCELLED
MY
POLICY
AND
SWITCHED
TO
ANOTHER
COMPANY
THE
COUP
DE
GRAS
CAME
WHEN
THEY
SENT
ME
A
BILL
FOR
AN
ADDITIONAL
BALANCE
DUE
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
COLLISIONCOMPREHENSIVE
COST
BETWEEN
MY
SPORTS
CAR
AND
MY
CLUNKER
I
RETURNED
THE
BILL
UNPAID
WITH
A
NASTYGRAM
PLUS
EXPLICITY
DIRECTIONS
TO
PERFORM
RECTOCRANIAL
INSERTION
HAVENT
HEARD
FROM
THEM
SINCE
EVERYONES
ENTITLED
TO
MY
OPINION
GOLDBERGOASYSDTNAVYMIL
IMAGINATION
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
KNOWLEDGE
ALBERT
EINSTEIN
GOOD
FOR
YOU
I
AM
CONVINCED
THAT
SOMEONE
SHOULD
START
A
BOYCOTT
AGAINST
GEICO
