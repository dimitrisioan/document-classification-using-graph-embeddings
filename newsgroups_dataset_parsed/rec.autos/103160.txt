i
heard
the
diesels
are
considered
cleanerburning
than
gas
engines
because
the
emit
less
of
carbon
monoxide
hydrocarbons
and
oxides
of
nitrogen
co
hc
nox
but
they
can
put
out
a
lot
of
particulate
matter
i
heard
something
about
legislation
being
discussed
to
clean
up
diesel
emissions
is
there
anything
in
the
works
to
install
scrubbers
for
diesels
how
about
the
feasibility
of
installing
them
on
trucks
and
cars
would
it
be
any
different
than
a
catylitic
converter
id
assume
easier
since
were
removing
particulate
matter
instead
of
converting
gasses
lets
hear
peoples
opinions
this
really
bugs
me
the
emissions
of
diesels
are
the
cleanest
of
any
vechicle
but
they
are
considered
so
polluting
that
they
are
banned
in
passenger
cars
in
california
what
a
bunch
of
crap
diesel
is
the
fuel
of
choice
for
enviromental
benefit
in
europe
while
here
its
illegal
for
the
same
reason
the
particulates
are
nothing
but
carbon
they
are
just
an
annoyance
at
worst
nothing
beats
the
diesel
cycle
for
efficiency
and
emissions
torque
or
engine
durability
its
also
cheaper
diesels
fall
into
the
same
emissions
mythology
as
alcohol
fuels
the
main
reason
they
are
considered
cleaner
is
because
they
are
better
at
the
emissions
we
actually
measure
and
regulate
but
they
also
contribute
additional
emissions
which
have
long
been
determined
to
be
as
harmful
but
no
suitable
control
or
limits
have
been
defined
current
evidence
is
pointing
to
most
visible
smog
actually
being
diesel
emissions
and
suspended
particles
and
less
of
a
photochemical
reaction
diesel
particulates
are
now
becoming
a
major
concern
in
decreased
lung
capacity
and
alcohols
emit
signifcantly
more
aldehydes
a
known
carcinigen
than
gasoline
the
evidence
is
mounting
that
while
we
have
been
beating
the
gasoline
engine
to
death
we
may
have
been
ignoring
the
effects
of
the
alternatives
and
anyone
who
thinks
diesels
are
so
great
should
go
and
spend
a
few
hours
in
rush
hour
traffic
in
some
cities
in
europe
there
the
stench
of
the
diesels
is
awful
and
it
can
even
burn
the
eyes
diesels
being
clean
is
only
relative
to
our
current
standards
mark
