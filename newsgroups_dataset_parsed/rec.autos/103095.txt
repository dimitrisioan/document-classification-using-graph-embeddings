WRITES
IVE
A
MAZDA
WITH
ABOUT
MILES
ON
IT
RECENTLY
I
DO
NOT
GET
A
GOOD
FEELING
OF
THE
ROAD
ESP
ON
A
WET
PAVEMENT
WHEN
DRIVING
THE
CAR
IT
FEELS
AS
IF
THE
CAR
IS
WANDERING
AND
THERE
IS
NO
GRIP
ON
THE
ROAD
THE
TIRES
ARE
THE
ORIGINAL
ONES
AND
HAVE
THREADS
ON
THEM
PASSES
THE
PENNY
HEAD
TEST
I
HAD
THE
SHOCKS
AND
STRUTS
AND
ALIGNMENT
CHECKED
AND
THINGS
ARE
FINE
HOWEVER
I
FEEL
LIKE
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
GRIP
OF
THE
ROAD
AND
FEEL
AS
IF
THE
CAR
IS
WANDERING
ESP
ON
TURNS
ANY
HELP
IN
THIS
IS
APPRECIATED
THANKS
TWO
SHOTS
AT
IT
CHECK
THE
TIRES
AGAIN
IF
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
WEAR
BARS
YOURE
DOWN
TO
PROBLEM
AREA
AND
SOME
TIRES
PASS
A
PENNY
TEST
BETWEEN
THE
BARS
THATS
NO
GUIDE
AT
ALL
YOUR
PROBLEM
IN
THE
WET
IS
CALL
HYDROPLANING
YOU
MAY
NOT
HAVE
ENOUGH
TREAD
LEFT
TO
CHANNEL
WATER
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
TIRE
SO
IT
GOES
FISHY
ON
YOU
AS
IT
LIFTS
OFF
THE
ROAD
TIRES
AGE
IN
PARTICULAR
SOFT
TIRE
COMPOUNDS
GET
HARDER
AS
YOU
PUT
THEM
THRU
MORE
HEAT
CYCLES
HARDER
COMPOUNDS
DONT
GRIP
AS
WELL
AS
SOFT
ONES
EFFECT
IS
VERY
NOTICABLE
ON
TIRES
THAT
GET
VERY
HOT
VERY
OFTEN
SUCH
AS
IN
COMPETITION
BUT
IT
HITS
ALL
TIRES
