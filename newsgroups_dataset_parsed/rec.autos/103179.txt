many

many

i
have
had
all
the
major
brand
detectors
and
imho
nothing
else
even
comes
close
to
the
i
hadnt
heard
of
the
before
cardriver
and
other
auto
magazines
recommend
bel
detectors
i
was
considering
their
latest
the
which
picks
up
super
wideband
ka
and
laser
as
well
it
also
avoids
radar
detector
detectors
although
i
really
dont
care
about
this
since
i
doubt
ill
be
driving
in
virginia
anytime
soon
or
have
any
other

made
