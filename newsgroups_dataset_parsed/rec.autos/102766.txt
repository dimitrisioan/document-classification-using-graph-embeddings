MILITECH
I
SAW
AN
INTERESTING
PRODUCT
IN
NY
AUTO
SHOW
AND
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
YOUR
COMMENTS
MILITECHTM
IS
YET
ANOTHER
OIL
ADDITIVE
BUT
THE
DEMONSTRATION
OF
THIS
PRODUCT
REALLY
IMPRESSIVE
IF
IT
DIDNT
CHEAT
THE
SETUP
OF
THE
DEMO
IS
FAIRLY
SIMPLE
A
CONE
SHAPED
ROTOR
IS
HALF
SUBMERGED
IN
A
SMALL
OIL
SINK
FILLED
WITH
MOTOR
OIL
THE
ROTOR
IS
POWERED
BY
AN
ELECTRONIC
MOTOR
A
METAL
PAD
IS
PRESSED
AGAINST
THE
ROTOR
USING
THE
TORQUE
WRENCH
UNTIL
THE
ROTOR
STOPPED
BY
FRICTION
THE
TORQUE
THAT
IS
NEEDED
TO
STOP
ROTOR
IS
READ
FROM
THE
TORQUE
WRENCH
BEFORE
MILITECH
WAS
ADDED
THE
ROTOR
WAS
STOPPED
WITH
ABOUT
LBFT
OF
TORQUE
YOU
PICK
THE
BRAND
OF
OIL
NO
DIFFERENCE
ONCE
MILITECH
WAS
ADDED
TO
THE
OIL
THE
ROTOR
COULD
NOT
BE
STOPPED
EVEN
WITH
LBFT
OF
TORQUE
HERE
IS
THE
GOOD
PART
EVEN
AFTER
THE
SALESMAN
EMPTIED
THE
OIL
SINK
YOU
STILL
COULD
NOT
STOPPED
THE
ROTOR
WITH
THE
THIN
FILM
REMAINED
ON
IT
THEY
SAY
YOU
NEED
ONLY
ADD
PER
QUART
OF
OIL
EVERY
MILES
A
OZ
BOTTLE
IS
I
STILL
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
IF
THIS
PRODUCT
IS
REALLY
SO
GREAT
WHY
IT
WAS
SO
LITTLE
KNOWN
THE
SALESMAN
SAID
IT
IS
WIDELY
USED
IN
MILITARY
I
DIDNT
BELIEVE
IT
THE
DEMO
WAS
SO
IMPRESSIVE
THAT
I
BOUGHT
A
BOTTLE
AGAINST
MY
COMMON
SENSE
HAS
ANYONE
HEARD
OF
OR
ACTUALLY
USED
THIS
PRODUCT
IS
IT
REAL
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
THE
AUTO
SHOW
PLEASE
VISIT
THIS
STAND
ON
THE
SECOND
FLOOR
SEE
IF
CAN
FIND
OUT
IF
THE
DEMO
IS
A
HOAX
OR
NOT
