BECAUSE
I
WANT
TO
GET
THE
LOWEST
PRICE
POSSIBLE
ITS
CALLED
CAPITALISM
I
HAVE
NEWS
FOR
YOU
CAPITALISM
IS
THE
PRACTICE
OF
MAXIMIZING
PROFITS
SAME
DIFFERENCE
IF
YOU
LOWER
YOUR
COSTS
YOU
INCREASE
YOUR
PROFITS
PERSONALLY
IM
NOT
AT
ALL
BOTHERED
BY
THE
SATURN
PRICING
SCHEME
IF
I
DONT
WANT
TO
PAY
AS
MUCH
AS
THEYRE
SELLING
IT
FOR
I
CAN
GO
BUY
A
DIFFERENT
CAR
FROM
A
DIFFERENT
DEALER
AND
THEY
GET
NOTHING
THATS
COMPETITION
FOR
YOU
IF
THE
DEALER
CAN
BE
COMPETITIVE
CHARGING
WHAT
THEY
DO
AND
MAKING
THAT
KIND
OF
PROFIT
THATS
CAPITALISM
AT
ITS
BEST
AND

THE
