because
i
want
to
get
the
lowest
price
possible
its
called
capitalism
i
have
news
for
you
capitalism
is
the
practice
of
maximizing
profits
same
difference
if
you
lower
your
costs
you
increase
your
profits
personally
im
not
at
all
bothered
by
the
saturn
pricing
scheme
if
i
dont
want
to
pay
as
much
as
theyre
selling
it
for
i
can
go
buy
a
different
car
from
a
different
dealer
and
they
get
nothing
thats
competition
for
you
if
the
dealer
can
be
competitive
charging
what
they
do
and
making
that
kind
of
profit
thats
capitalism
at
its
best
and
more
power
to
em
id
rather
have
the
consumer
dictate
what
things
will
cost
not
the
dealers
sorry
but
neither
dictates
the
cost
its
a
negotiation
whether
its
up
front
at
a
honda
dealership
in
an
all
out
dickering
war
or
more
removed
on
a
larger
economic
scale
ie
if
saturn
cant
sell
at
its
price
the
price
drops
or
the
company
stops
building
them
it
remains
a
negotiated
value
controlled
by
market
forces
to
think
that
the
consumer
controls
price
is
ludicrous
if
the
consumer
controled
price
then
cars
would
be
freeand
no
one
would
build
cars
regards
charles
within
the
span
of
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
heard
elements
of
separate
threads
which
in
that
they
have
been
conjoined
in
time
struck
together
to
form
a
new
chord
within
my
hollow
and
echoing
