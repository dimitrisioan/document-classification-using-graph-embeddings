COULD
WE
PLASE
CEASE
THIS
DISCUSSION
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
WHY
PEOPLE
FEEL
THE
NEED
TO
EXPOUND
UPON
THIS
ISSUE
FOR
DAYS
AND
DAYS
ON
END
THESE
AREAS
ARE
NOT
MEANT
FOR
THIS
TYPE
OF
DISCUSSION
IF
YOU
FEEL
THE
NEED
TO
DO
SUCH
THINGS
PLEASE
TAKE
YOUR
THOUGHT
ELSEWHERE
THANKS
EXACTLY
MY
POINT
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
HOSTILITY
TO
AND
FROM
TEENAGERS
IF
YOU
FOLLOW
THE
NEWS
FOR
THE
NORTHWEST
USA
YOU
WILL
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
A
GROUP
OF
OLD
BOYS
BARELY
OUT
OF
THE
TEENS
CERTAINLY
THEIR
OUTLOOK
WAS
DEVELOPED
DURING
THEIR
TEENS
JUST
SHOT
AND
KILLED
AN
INNOCENT
LITTLE
GIRL
RIDING
IN
A
CAR
IN
THE
SEATTLE
AREA
WHEN
HER
MOTHER
WHO
WAS
DRIVING
HONKED
HER
HORN
AT
THE
CAR
WITH
THE
BOYS
IN
IT
THIS
IS
REALLY
UPSETTING
AND
MAKES
MY
STOMACH
TURN
AS
IT
WOULD
ANY
PARENTS
DOESNT
YOUR
HEART
JUST
GO
OUT
TO
THAT
POOR
MOTHER
TEENAGERS
BOTH
DRIVE
CARS
AND
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
AUTOMOTIVE
VANDALISM
AND
CRIME
MAYBE

THIS
NEWSGROUP
HAS
HAD
SPECIFIC
EXPERIENCE
IN
DEALING
WITH
VIOLENT
TEENAGE
OFFENDERS
LIKE
THESE
KIDS
ARE
AT
THE
SAME
IT
SEEMS
SAD
THAT
PEOPLE
LOSE
ALL
PERSPECTIVE
WHEN
THEY
HERE
ABOUT
A
CASE
OF
VIOLENCE
BY
TEENAGERS
FOR
A
LITTLE
PERSPECTIVE
HOW
ABOUT
THE
THOUSANDS
OF
KIND
TEENAGERS
WHO
VOLUNTEER
AT
LOCAL
AGENCIES
TO
HELP
CHILDREN
SENIORS
THE
HOMELESS
DID
YOU
READ
ABOUT
ALL
THE
KIDS
AT
STANFORD
WHO
SPENT
THEIR
SPRING
BREAKS
HELPING
OUT
IN
INNER
CITY
AREAS
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
HUNDREDS
OF
VOLUNTEERS
TEENAGERS
AND
OTHERS
WHO
WORKED
TO
CLEAN
UP
THE
MESS
AFTER
THE
RODNEY

HOW

THEY
BELONG
TO
HOW
MANY
GIRL
SCOUT
COOKIES
HAVE
YOU
BOUGHT
HOW
MANY
CHOCOLATE
BARS
FOR

UP
ON
ALL
THE
ANOMALIES
THE

ABOUT
THE
WONDERFUL

ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE

WORK
HARD
AT
SCHOOL
GET
GOOD
GRADES
GO
TO
COLLEGE
OR
TO
WORK
AND
MAKE
A
REAL
CONTRIBUTION
TO
OUR
SOCIETY
ALL
HUMANS
ARE
TEENAGERS
AT
SOME
TIME
IN
THEIR
LIVES
MOTHER
THERESA
WAS
A
TEENAGER
AND
SO
WAS
GEOFFREY
DAHMER
IT
IS
REALLY
SAD
TO
SEE
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
BUY
THE
SENSATIONAL
REPORTING
OF
THE
MEDIA
AS
SOME
KIND
OF
REFLECTION
OF
THE
WORLD
TODAY
IT
IS
A
REFLECTION
OF
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
