RE
DIRTY
DIESELS
FROM

KUMARAVEL
NATARAJAN
BUT
THEY
CAN
PUT
OUT
A
LOT
OF
PARTICULATE
MATTER
I
HEARD
SOMETHING
ABOUT
LEGISLATION
BEING
DISCUSSED
TO
CLEAN
UP
DIESEL
EMISSIONS
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
IN
THE
WORKS
TO
INSTALL
SCRUBBERS
FOR
DIESELS
HOW
ABOUT
THE
FEASIBILITY
OF
INSTALLING
THEM
ON
TRUCKS
AND
CARS
WOULD
IT
BE
ANY
DIFFERENT
THAN
A
CATYLITIC
CONVERTER
ID
ASSUME
EASIER
SINCE
WERE
REMOVING
PARTICULATE
MATTER
INSTEAD
OF
CONVERTING
GASSES
LETS
HEAR
PEOPLES
OPINIONS
THE
TECHNOLOGY
CUMMINS
IS
APPLYING
TO
DIESELS
TO
COMPLY
WITH
THE
NEWER
CA
EMISSIONS
LAWS
INVOLVES
THREE
THINGS
I
KNOW
OF
ALL
COMPLIANT
DIESELS
ARE
TURBOCHARGED
ALL
USE
AN
AFTERCOOLER
WHICH
COOLS
THE
AIR
WHICH
WAS
HEATED
BY
COMPRESSION
BY
THE
TURBOCHARGER
UP
TO
ABOUT
PSI
A
GISMO
ON
THE
INJECTOR
PUMP
WHICH
SENSES
THE
PRESSURIZED
AIR
INTAKE
AND
LIMITS
FULL
DELIVERY
OF
FUEL
WHILE
THE
PRESSURE
IS
LOW
NO
SCRUBBERS
CATALYTIC
CONVERTERS
ETC
ARE
USED
THE
PATH
FROM
THE
TURBOCHARGER
TO
THE
EXHAUST
OUTLET
IS
KEPT
VERY
FREE
INTERESTINGLY
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
LOWPRESSURE
FUEL
LIMITATION
POWER
OUTPUT
AND
MILEAGE
ARE
ENHANCED
BY
THESE
MEASURES
ONE
CAN
BUY
AFTERMARKET
TURBOS
AND
AFTERCOOLERS
WHICH
GENERATE
MORE
POWER
LOTS
MORE
POWER
AND
THESE
ARE
APPROVED
BY
THE
CARB

HEPNER
