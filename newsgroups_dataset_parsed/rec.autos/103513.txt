RE
WHAT
IS
THE
DEAL
WITH
BLUEBOOK
VALUE
OF
AN
AUTO
MAIL
BOUNCED
SO
IN
ARTICLE
YOU
WRITE
I
AM
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
BUYING
A
NEW
AUTO
I
HAVENT
DECIDED
YET
WHETHER
I
SHOULD
SELL
MY
CURRENT
CAR
MYSELF
OR
TRADE
IT
IN
AS
PART
OF
THE
NEW
AUTO
PURCHASE
TRADITIONAL
WISDOM
SAYS
YOU
ARE
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
BETTER
OFF
SELLING
IT
YOURSELF
IF
YOU
DONT
MIND
THAT
EXTRA
HASSLE
HAVING
A
TRADEIN
ON
A
PURCHASE
JUST
MAKES
GETTING
THE
BEST
PRICE
FROM
A
DEALERSHIP
MORE
CONFUSING
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
BLUE
BOOK
VALUE
FOR
THE
CAR
IS
I
ASSUME
THIS
IS
RETAIL
BLUEBOOK
THERE
ARE
TWO
BLUEBOOK
PRICES
ONE
FOR
RETAIL
AND
ONE
FOR
WHOLESALE
YOU
REALLY
WANT
THE
RETAIL
PRICE
IF
YOU
CAN
GET
IT
THE
BLUE
BOOKS
ALSO
HAVE
ADJUSTMENTS
YOU
CAN
MAKE
FOR
LOW
MILEAGE
AND
EXTRAS
ON
YOUR
PARTICULAR
CAR
YOU
SHOULD
LOOK
ALL
THIS
STUFF
UP
YOURSELF
ALSO
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
THE
BLUE
BOOK
PRICES
ARE
AVERAGES
OVER
THE
COUNTRY
THAT
MAY
NOT
APPLY
IN
YOUR
AREA
FOR
EXAMPLE
BLUE
BOOK
PRICES
ARE
LOW
FOR
CALIFORNIA
A
BETTER
WAY
OF
FINDING
OUT
HOW
MUCH
YOUR
CAR
MIGHT
BE
WORTH
IS
TO
CALL
AROUND
AND
SEE
WHAT
ITS
SELLING
FOR
IF
ANY
USED
LOTS
HAVE
ONE
OR
LOOKING
IN
LOCAL
PAPERS
FOR
SIMILAR
CARS
AND
CHECKING
OUT
THE
PRICES
IT
MIGHT
BE
MORE
TIME
EFFICIENT
TO
TAKE
A
SMALL
LOSS
RATHER
THAN
HOLD
OUT
FOR
MONTHS
FOR
THE
BEST
PRICE
AN
ACQUAINTENCE
HAS
OFFERED
TO
GIVE
ME
BLUE
BOOK
VALUE
FOR
THE
CAR
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
AN
ACQUAINTANCE
BUT
I
WOULD
MAKE
DARN
SURE
THAT
I
WAS
PAID
THAT
IS
CASHIERS
CHECK
IN
FULL
BEFORE
DELIVERY
THERES
A
REAL
TEMPTATION
WHEN
SELLING
TO
A
PSEUDOFRIEND
TO
BE
MORE
ACCOMODATING
THAN
YOU
SHOULD
MAKE
SURE
YOU
GET
THE
MONEY
AND
IF
THEY
HEDGE
ABOUT
PAYING
IN
FULL
AT
THE
START
WITH
A
CASHIERS
CHECK
OR
CASH
THEN
I
WOULD
GO
ELSEWHERE
REMEMEBER
THAT
YOU
CAN
PROBABLY
SELL
YOUR
CAR
TO
A
USED
CAR
LOT
OR
WHOLESALER
AND
GET
WHOLESALE
BLUEBOOK
THATS
PROBABLY
A
SAFER
APPROACH
THAN
SELLING
TO
A
PRIVATE
PARTY
ALAN
MOUNTAIN
DEW
AND
DOUGHNUTS
AMESELROYALAN
BECAUSE
BREAKFAST
IS
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
