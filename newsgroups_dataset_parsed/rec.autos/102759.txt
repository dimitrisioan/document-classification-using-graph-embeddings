YOU
CAN
AVOID
THESE
PROBLEMS
ENTIRELY
BY
INSTALLING
AN
OIL
DRAIN
VALVE
IN

OF
THE
BOLT
I
HAVE
ONE
ON

OF

THERE
HAVE
BEEN
NO
LEAKS
IN
MILES
COMBINED
MILES
ON
BOTH
CARS
YES
BUT
THEN
SOMEONE
WOULD
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
DRAINING
YOUR
OIL
IN
A
PARKING
LOT
ALL
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
REACH
UNDERNEATH
TURN
A
VALVE
AND
FORGET
THE
TRIP
HOME
MOST
CARS
HAVE
DRAIN
PETCOCKS
IN
THE

NEVER
SEEN

HEARD
OF
A
VANDAL
OPENING

I
IMAGINE
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
AN
EVEN
LOWER
RISK
WITH
AN
OIL

BECAUSE
YOU
HAVE
TO
CRAWL

VANDALS
ARE
USUALLY

DO
THINGS
THAT
