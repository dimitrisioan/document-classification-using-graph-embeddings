SELLING
A
CAR
THROUGH
A
CAR
HUNTER
ANYBODY
GOT
ANY
GOODBAD
EXPERIENCE
WITH
SELLING
THEIR
CAR
THROUGH
ONE
OF
THOSE
CAR
HUNTERS
IM
SELLING
A
DODGE
STEALTH
RT
AND
I
WAS
CONTACTED
BY
THIS
COMPANY
CALLED
THE
MARKHAM
GROUP
BASED
OUT
OF
ILLINOIS
THEY
SAID
THEY
HAVE
BUYERS
IN
MY
AREA
INTERESTED
IN
MY
CAR
OR
THEY
WOULDNT
BE
TALKING
TO
ME
THEY
TALKED
TO
ME
FOR
A
GOOD
MINUTES
ASKING
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
MY
CAR
AND
SAID
THEY
COULD
SELL
IT
NO
PROBLEM
THEY
GUARANTEED
THAT
IF
THEY
DIDNT
SELL
MY
CAR
IN
DAYS
I
WOULD
GET
MY
MONEY
BACK
AND
SINCE
I
CHARGED
IT
IM
PROTECTED
BY
FEDERAL
LAW
WHICH
STATES
THAT
IF
IM
NOT
SATISFIED
I
WOULD
GET
A
REFUND
WHICH
IS
TRUE
THEY
FEDERAL
EXPRESSED
ALL
THE
PAPERWORK
TO
ME
WHICH
HAD
A
CONTRACT
STATING
THEIR
POLICY
ABOUT
THE
DAYS
AND
SUCH
I
CALLED
UP
THE
BBB
IN
ILLINOIS
AND
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
FILE
ON
THEM
WHICH
IS
GOOD
NEWS
SO
THEY
DEFINITELY
ARE
A
LEGITIMATE
COMPANY
BUT
SO
FAR
ITS
BEEN
OVER
WEEK
AND
I
HAVE
GOTTEN
NOTHING
SO
HOW
EFFECTIVE
ARE
THESE
TYPES
OF
COMPANIES
ANYBODY
CARE
TO
SHARE
THEIR
EXPERIENCES
