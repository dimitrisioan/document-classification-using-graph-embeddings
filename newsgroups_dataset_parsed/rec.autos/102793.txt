IS
CLEAR
COAT
REALLY
WORTH
IT
YES
ON
THE
SHOWROOM
FLOOR
THE
CARS
HAVE
THIS
DEEP
LUSTROUS
SHINE
THAT
JUST
CANT
BE
FOUND
ON
PAINT
JOBS
THAT
ARENT
CLEAR
COATED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IT
SEEMS
THAT
EVERY
CLEAR
COATED
CAR
THAT
IVE
SEEN
ON
THE
ROAD
IN
A
PARKING
LOT
ETC
HAS
FINE
SCRATCHES
THROUGHOUT
THE
PAINT
JOB
AS
DOES
ALAS
MY
LASER
SEVERAL
WEEKS
AGO
I
HAD
MY
CAR
PROFESSIONALLY
POLISHED
AND
WAXED
WHEN
I
PICKED
IT
UP
IT
HAD
THAT
SAME
SHOWROOM
SHINE
THAT
I
REMEMBER
FROM
A
YEAR
AGO
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
IT
SEVERAL
DAYS
AGO
I
TOOK
MY
CAR
TO
THE
DEALERSHIP
FOR
SOME
WORK
AS
AN
ADDED
BONUS
THEY
WASHED
MY
CAR
UNFORTUNATELY
WHOEVER
WASHED
IT
EITHER
DIDNT
GET
THE
ROOF
WHICH
IS
BLACK
THE
REST
OF
THE
CAR
IS
RED
COMPLETELY
CLEAN
BEFORE
HE
DRIED
IT
OR
HE
USED
A
DIRTY
TOWEL
NOW
MY
SHOWROOM
SHINE
IS
A
HAZE
OF
FINE
SCRATCHES
THAT
ARENT
REALLY
VISIBLE
UNTIL
THE
LIGHT
HITS
THE
ROOF
AT
A
PARTICULAR
ANGLE
I
AM
TO
PUT
IT
MILDY
SOMEWHAT
PEEVED
ABOUT
THIS
DO
I
HAVE
ANY
CHANCE
OF
GETTING
THE
DEALERSHIP
TO
DO
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THIS
MY
GUESS
IS
NO
IS
THERE
ANY
PRODUCT
ON
THE
MARKET
THAT
PROVIDES
A
SOLUTION
TO
THIS
PROBLEM
OR
AM
I
FACED
WITH
THE
PROSPECT
OF
HAVING
THE
CAR
PROFESSIONALLY
POLISHED
AGAIN
TO
HIDE
THE
SCRATCHES
INFORMATION
