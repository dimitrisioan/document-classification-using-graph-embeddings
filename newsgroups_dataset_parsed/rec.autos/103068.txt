RE
NOISY
ENGINE
ELIOT
IS
RIGHT
ABOUT
LITER
ENGINE
IN
THE
SECOND
AND
LAST
GENERATION
BUT
THE
ORIGINAL
GUY
DID
NOT
INDICATE
THE
YEAR
OF
HIS
IF
ITS
A
FIRST
GENERATION
CAR
LIKE
MY
IT
HAS
LITER
ENGINE
OR
PERHAPS
SAME
ENGINE
WITH
A
SUPERCHARGER
IF
ITS
THE
SOUND
HE
DESCRIBES
IS
COMMON
TO
ANY
OLDER
TOYOTA
ENGINE
I
EVER
HEARD
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
RELEVANCE
OF
HIS
OBSERVATIONS
ABOUT
OIL
CHANGES
MY
SIMPLY
MAKES
NOISE
NOT
ALL
THAT
ANNOYING
MIND
YOU
BUT
YOU
HEAR
IT
WELL
WHEN
THE
ENGINE
IS
RIGHT
BEHIND
YOUR
LEFT
EAR
MIKES
SORRY
BOUT
THAT
MINE
IS
A
MODEL
NONTURBO
WITH
ABS
AND
REVISED
SUSPENSION
WHATEVER
REVISED
MEANS
IM
IN
AUSTRALIA
SO
WE
ALWAYS
SEEM
TO
GET
THE
VERSIONS
WITHOUT
EXTRAS
WHICH
THE
EUROPEANS
AND
AMERICANS
GET
AS
STANDARD
MY
QUERY
IS
WHY
DOES
THE
NOISE
GET
NOTICEABLY
LOUDER
ABOUT
MONTHS
AFTER
AN
OIL
CHANGE
I
JUST
FIND
IT
A
BIT
WIERD
THAT
THIS
HAPPENS
IS
IT
THE
OIL
IM
USING
MOBIL
OR
IS
IT
THE
ENGINE
THE
VERSIONMODEL
IE
GETS
NOISER
THE
OLDER
THE
OIL
IS
IM
ONLY
GUESSING
ITS
NOT
ANNOYINGLY
DISTRESSING
OR
ANYTHING
BUT
JUST
SLIGHTLY
PUZZLING
PUZZLED
