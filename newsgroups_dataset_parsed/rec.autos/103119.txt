RE
DENTS
ON
CAR
ALL
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
TURN
IT
IN
TO
THE
POLICE
LIKE
YOU
WOULD
AN
ACCIDENT
GET
A
REPORT
AND
SEND
IT
IN
TO
YOUR
INSURANCE
COMPANY
AND
THEY
WILL
CONTACT
THE
OTHER
GUYS
INSURANCE
COMPANY
AND
THEY
WILL
HAVE
TO
PAY
JUST
AS
THEY
WOULD
IN
AN
ACCIDENT
THEY
CAUSED
THUS
NO
NEED
TO
GO
TO
COURT
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
DID
THIS
AND
HE
GOT
THE
MONEY
SO
IT
DOES
WORK
