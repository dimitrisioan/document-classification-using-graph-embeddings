re
what
car
is
this
you
guys
are
correct
the
bricklin
was
produced
in
canada
the
national
museum
of
science
and
technology
here
in
ottawa
has
one
and
sometimes
they
put
it
on
display
most
of
the
time
it
stays
in
storage
because
the
museum
doesnt
have
much
room
its
a
big
deal
for
a
car
to
be
canadian
and
thats
why
they
have
it
if
anybodys
a
fan
they
also
have
a
nice
green
riviera
that
looks
like
it
just
came
out
of
the
showroom
