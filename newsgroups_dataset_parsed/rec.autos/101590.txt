SVX
OIL
CHANGE
MY
FRIEND
BROUGHT
A
SUBARU
SVX
RECENTLY
I
HAD
DROVE
IT
FOR
COUPLES
TIMES
AND
I
THINK
ITS
A
GREAT
CAR
ESP
ON
SNOW
HOWEVER
WHEN
SHE
TOOK
IT
TO
A
LOCAL
SUBARU
DEALER
FOR
A
OIL
CHANGE
THE
BILL
CAME
OUT
TO
BE
ABOUT
DOLLARS
THE
DEALER
TOLD
US
IT
IS
BECAUSE
TO
CHANGE
THE
OIL
FILTER
ON
A
SVX
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
DISASSEMBLE
A
METAL
COVER
UNDER
THE
ENGINE
AND
THAT
TOOK
AN
HOUR
OF
LABOUR
AT
FIRST
WE
THINK
WE
ARE
BEING
RIPPED
OFF
SO
SHE
PHONE
TO
A
DEALER
IN
TORONTO
BUT
FOUND
OUT
THE
THEY
ARE
CHARGING
ROUGHLY
THE
SAME
PRICE
SO
IS
THERE
ANY
SVX
OWNER
OUT
THERE
THAT
HAS
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
AND
IF
THE
OIL
CHANGE
STORY
IS
TRUE
THEN
THE
ENGINEER
OF
SUBARU
LOOKS
PRETTY
STUBID
TO
ME
BY
THE
WAY
THE
CAR
LOOKS
GREAT
SWD
WAN
