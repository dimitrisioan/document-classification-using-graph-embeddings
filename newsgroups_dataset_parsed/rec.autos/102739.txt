RE
SATURN
MANUAL
TRANSMISSION
PROBLEM
I
HAD
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
WITH
A
HORIZON
THIRD
GEAR
WOULD
JUST
DISENGAGE
ENGINE
WOULD
REV
UP
KIND
OF
DISCONCERTING
I
SOLD
THAT
CAR
QUITE
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
BUT
THE
MEMORY
OF
THAT
TRANNY
STICKS
WITH
ME
IT
ALSO
HAD
A
CLUTCH
CHATTER
IN
FIRST
THAT
THE
DEALER
COULD
NOT
FIX
IF
THE
LEMON
LAW
HAD
BEEN
IN
PLACE
THEN
THAT
CAR
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
COVERED
I
HAVE
HAD
SEVERAL
JAP
CARS
SINCE
THEN
FIGURING
THE
HORIZON
WAS
MY
CONTRIBUTION
TO
THE
AMERICAN
AUTO
COMPANIES
AND
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANY
BAD
BEHAVIOR
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
A
TOYOTA
TERCEL
WITH
A
BIT
OF
CLUTCH
CHATTER
THAT
THEY
DID
FIX
ON
THE
FIRST
TRY
ANYWAY
FROM
THAT
DAY
FORWARD
I
HAVE
SWORN
THAT
I
WOULD
NEVER
PURCHASE
ANOTHER
AMERICAN
CAR
WITH
A
STANDARD
AMERICAN
MANUFACTURERS
DONT
HAVE
A
CLUE
ON
HOW
TO
MANUFACTURE
FIVE
SPEED
TRANSMISSIONS
AND
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
THE
AUTOMATICS
MUCH
LONGER
AND
ON
MANY
MORE
CARS
HOWEVER
I
HATE
AUTOMATICS
SO
I
AM
STILL
BUYING
JAP
CARS
NOT
SURE
THIS
IS
ANY
HELP
BUT
OTHER
CARS
DO
THIS
TOO
