vw
jetta
gli
help
i
am
considering
the
purchse
of
a
vw
jetta
gli
with
miles
on
it
i
recently
found
out
that
there
are
two
versions
of
the
gli
and
i
know
of
three
differences
between
the
two
cars
that
both
carry
the
same
name
the
version
has
more
horsepower
wheel
discs
and
a
standard
sunroof
oops
thats
the
difference
between
the
gli
and
the
regular
gl
so
in
addition
to
the
engine
what
other
differences
exist
between
the
two
models
of
the
jetta
gli
more
importantly
how
can
i
tell
which
version
this
one
is
there
are
no
badges
that
said
so
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
is
the
version
assuming
this
one
the
one
i
looked
at
is
the
version
is
there
a
valid
reason
to
buy
it
instead
of
a
comparably
equipped
gl
which
would
cost
less
of
course
i
would
love
to
get
the
version
but
money
talks
please
email
any
responses
thank
you
