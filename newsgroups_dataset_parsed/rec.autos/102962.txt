ford
probe
opinions
centered

the

jeremy
g

zonkercmuedu
says
can
anyone
offer
any
opinions
of
the
ford
probe
ala
how
they
do
in
the
long
run
repair
records
reliability
mileage
etc
i
am
fixing
to
buy
a
car
in
the
next
few
months
aiming
toward
something
a
little
bigger
than
a
typical
small
car
and
with
a
little
more
power
i
am
considering
the
probe
accord
corolla
and
the
the
probe
is
the
youngest
of
the
bunch
thus
my
interest
in
opinions
but
every
magazine
and
ratings
book
places
it
as
an
excellent
value
btw
the
is
rearwheel
drive
and
is
due
for
a
redesign
for
thanks
in
advance
while
i
dont
read
normally
read
this
group
i
was
looking
for
valentine
radar
information
sigh
maybe
in
the
faq
and
came
across
your
posting
i
bought
a
probe
gt
with
the
pep
last
july
now
at
miles
after
debating
over
the
sentra
stealth
prelude
and
celica
check
this
months
consumer
reports
for
previous
probe
records
my
criteria
a
fun
car
with
abs
airbag
over
and
less
than
i
thought
about
a
turbo
but
checking
with
insurance
people
ruled
that
out
the
tristar
cars
eclipsetalonetc
were
out
since
they
dont
have
an
air
bag
ditto
for
the
mustangalso
no
abs
the
fell
into
the
pocketrocket
category
a
good
used
car
buy
the
was
almost
there
but
rolled
more
than
i
liked
i
didnt
like
the
prelude
dashinstrumentation
at
all
too
weird
for
me
the
has
a
much
smaller
nonpassenger
space
than
i
needed
so
out
that
went
the
celica
was
ok
but
underpowered
when
loaded
with
options
and
somewhat
overpriced
too
in
nonturbo
form
i
never
considered
the
since
it
didnt
have
an
airbag
i
did
look
at
it
for
its
rwd
virtues
but
thats
it
the
corolla
never
entered
my
mind
i
should
have
looked
at
the
mitsubishi
stealth
more
since
my
list
was
exhausted
i
bought
the
probe
the
car
design
is
different
than
earlier
years
so
its
too
early
to
see
its
reliability
so
far
for
what
its
worth

left
hoping
for
as
you
can
see
im
primarily
interested
in
the
engine
while
it
doesnt
have
the
uummmph
of
a
bigliter
car
or
the
turbo
rush
the
big
selling
point
for
me
was
the
allaluminum
value
liter
engine
the
overall
car
is
a
good
buy
for
the
money
that
market
segment
hasnt
changed
much
since
july
prelude
vtec
honda
del
sol
i
drive
it
to
and
from
work
each
day
on
relatively
smooth
roads
and
most
noticable
thing
is
that
the
probes
suspension
doesnt
like
potholes
when
you
test
drive
one
find
a
potholed
road
somewhere
around
town
and
see
if
the
jarring
you
get
is
tolerable
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
my
back
seat
passengers
now
very
few
complain
about
the
lack
of
ventilation
you
may
want
to
consider
that
when
combined
with
the
heat
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
leather
and
the
keyless
entry
system
werent
available
when
i
got
the
car
so
i
cant
comment
on
them
i
got
the
car
before
it
was
officially
announced
i
prefer
cloth
to
leather
anyway
i
wouldnt
want
this
car
in
the
snow
the
suspension
is
too
rough
for
the
inevitable
surprise
potholes
tires
arent
meant
for
snow
and
the
seats
assume
that
youre
not
wearing
lots
of
thick
clothing
rain
is
much
better
water
generally
beads
off
the
windshield
at
freeway
speed
the
windshield
wiper
controls
are
easy
and
understandable
and
i
barely
hydroplaned
once
with
the
eagles
and
i
was
really
trying
there
is
also
a
definite
lack
of
cup
holdersmall
storage
places
the
gt
has
map
holders
below
the
speakers
in
the
door
but
theyre
rigid
plastic
that
could
fit
two
cassettes
or
cds
max
the
center
consolestorage
binarm
rest
has
cup
holder
and
the
back
of
the
front
seats
have
a
cloth
pouch
but
thats
it
no
change
holders
quite
a
letdown
from
the
sho
and
the
probe
is
definitely
not
a
peoplemover
car
or
an
econobox
car
lastly
dont
store
wet
car
covers
in
the
back
the
foam
will
soak
the
water
up
and
the
result
will
not
smell
pleasant
