ETC
I
AM
FIXING
TO
BUY
A
CAR
IN
THE
NEXT
FEW
MONTHS
AIMING
TOWARD
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
BIGGER
THAN
A
TYPICAL
SMALL
CAR
AND
WITH
A
LITTLE
MORE
POWER
I
AM
CONSIDERING
THE
PROBE
ACCORD
COROLLA
AND
THE
THE
PROBE
IS
THE
YOUNGEST
OF
THE
BUNCH
THUS
MY
INTEREST
IN
OPINIONS
BUT
EVERY
MAGAZINE
AND
RATINGS

PLACES
IT
AS
AN
EXCELLENT
VALUE

THE
IS

IS
DUE
FOR
A

FOR

IN

WHILE
I
DONT

I
WAS
LOOKING
FOR

RADAR
INFORMATION
SIGH
MAYBE
IN
THE
FAQ
AND
CAME
ACROSS
YOUR
POSTING
I
BOUGHT
A

WITH
THE

LESS

TOO
WEIRD
FOR

THE

MUCH
SMALLER

SPACE
THAN
I
NEEDED
SO
OUT
THAT
WENT
THE
CELICA
WAS
OK
BUT
UNDERPOWERED
WHEN
LOADED
WITH
OPTIONS
AND
SOMEWHAT
OVERPRICED
TOO
IN
NONTURBO
FORM
I
NEVER
CONSIDERED
THE
SINCE
IT
DIDNT
HAVE
AN
AIRBAG
I
DID
LOOK
AT
IT
FOR
ITS
RWD
VIRTUES
BUT
THATS
IT
THE
COROLLA
NEVER
ENTERED
MY
MIND
I
SHOULD
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
THE
MITSUBISHI
STEALTH
MORE
SINCE
MY
LIST
WAS
EXHAUSTED
I
BOUGHT
THE
PROBE
THE
CAR
DESIGN
IS
DIFFERENT
THAN
EARLIER
YEARS
SO
ITS
TOO
EARLY
TO
SEE
ITS
RELIABILITY
SO

WHAT
ITS

THE

SELLING

FOR

WAS

LITER

THE

A

BUY
FOR

THAT

SEGMENT
HASNT

PRELUDE
VTEC
HONDA
DEL
SOL
I
DRIVE
IT
TO
AND
FROM
WORK
EACH
DAY
ON
RELATIVELY
SMOOTH
ROADS
AND
MOST
NOTICABLE
THING
IS
THAT
THE
PROBES
SUSPENSION
DOESNT
LIKE
POTHOLES
WHEN
YOU
TEST
DRIVE
ONE
FIND
A
POTHOLED
ROAD
SOMEWHERE
AROUND
TOWN
AND
SEE
IF
THE
JARRING
YOU
GET
IS
TOLERABLE
IF
YOU
HAVE
PASSENGERS
BY
ALL
MEANS
BRING
THEM
ALONG
TOO
THEYLL
FIND
THAT
THEY
HAVE
NO
ROOM
IN
THE
BACK
AND
YOULL
FIND
THAT
THE
CAR
RIDES
DIFFERENTLY
IF
THATS
BETTER
IS
UP
TO
YOU
ALSO
THERES
A
LOT
OF
GLASS
AROUND
YOU
WHICH
I
WASNT
EXPECTING
THE
TEMPERATURE
INSIDE
THE
CAR
GETS
PRETTY
HOT
IN
THE
SUMMER
MY
BACK
SEAT
PASSENGERS
NOW
VERY
FEW
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THE
LACK
OF
VENTILATION
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
CONSIDER
THAT
WHEN
COMBINED
WITH
THE
HEAT
IVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
EXHAUST
SYSTEM
HAS
TROUBLE
BUT
MINE
WORKS
FINE
LEATHER
AND
THE
KEYLESS
ENTRY
SYSTEM
WERENT
AVAILABLE
WHEN
I
GOT
THE
CAR
SO
I
CANT
COMMENT
ON
THEM
I
GOT
THE
CAR
BEFORE
IT
WAS
OFFICIALLY
ANNOUNCED
I
PREFER
CLOTH
TO
LEATHER
ANYWAY
I
WOULDNT
WANT
THIS
CAR
IN
THE
SNOW
THE
SUSPENSION
IS
TOO
ROUGH
FOR
THE
INEVITABLE
SURPRISE
POTHOLES
TIRES
ARENT
MEANT
FOR
SNOW
AND
THE
SEATS
ASSUME
THAT
YOURE
NOT
WEARING
LOTS

THICK
CLOTHING
RAIN

GENERALLY
BEADS

BARELY

QUITE
A
