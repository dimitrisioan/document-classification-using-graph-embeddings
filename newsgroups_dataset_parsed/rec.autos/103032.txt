RE
CAR
BUYING
STORY
WAS
CHRIST
ANOTHER
DEALER
SERVICE
SCAM
IN
ARTICLE
DCDSEHOUSTONGEOQUESTSLBCOM
DAN
DAY
WRITES
RELATES
AN
EXPERIENCE
SIMILAR
TO
MINE
THEN
COMES
THE
PART
I
WISH
I
COULD
HAVE
VIDEOTAPED
AS
WE
GO
OUT
THE
FRONT
DOOR
THE
SALES
MANAGER
SHOUTS
ACROSS
THE
ENTIRE
SHOWROOM
CUSTOMERS
AND
ALL
GO
AHEAD
YOU
DESERVE
TO
BUY
A
NISSAN
SO
MY
FRIEND
BOUGHT
A
SENTRA
THIS
KIND
OF
BEHAVIOR
IS
WHAT
I
WAS
SHOCKED
BY
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
FOR
CRYING
OUT
LOUD
HOW
DO
THESE
TURKEYS
THINK
THEY
CAN
TALK
TO
CUSTOMERS
THIS
WAY
AND
STILL
STAY
IN
BUSINESS
AGAIN
I
DONT
EXPECT
SALES
PEOPLE
TO
BOW
SCRAPE
AND
GROVEL
IN
MY
PRESENCE
BUT
I
SURE
DONT
EXPECT
TO
BE
ABUSED
EITHER
I
WAS
VERY
SURPRISED
BY
THE
WAY
THE
SALES
PEOPLE
TALKED
TO
ME
AND
IN
OTHER
NEGOTIATING
SESSIONS
I
OVERHEARD
IN
NEIGHBORING
SALES
CUBICLES
EVIDENTLY
THEIR
SUCCESS
RATE
IS
HIGH
ENOUGH
THAT
THEY
CONTINUE
TO
DO
BUSINESS
THIS
WAY
THERE
MUST
BE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
WHO
ARE
EASY
TO
INTIMIDATE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THE
ONE
PRICE
NO
HAGGLING
APPROACH
THAT
SATURN
AND
OTHER
ARE
STARTING
TO
USE
I
GUESS
IF
THEIR
FIXED
PRICE
IS
FAIR
ITS
OK
MAYBE
THE
BEST
APPROACH
IS
TO
DO
YOUR
HOMEWORK
BEFORE
YOU
GO
IN
FIND
OUT
THE
INVOICE
PRICES
OF
THE
CAR
ADD
A
REASONABLE
PROFIT
FOR
THE
DEALER
OFFER
THEM
THAT
PRICE
AND
STICK
TO
IT
IF
THEY
GET
ABUSIVE
JUST
LEAVE
THEN
DONT
LET
THEM
TRY
TO
SCREW
YOU
AFTER
THE
DEAL
IS
AGREED
ON
MARK
