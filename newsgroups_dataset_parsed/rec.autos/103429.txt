WRITES
IM
CONSIDERING
SWITCHING
TO
GEICO
INSURANCE
BUT
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THEY
DO
NOT
ASSIGN
A
SPECIFIC
AGENT
FOR
EACH
POLICY
OR
CLAIM
I
WAS
WORRIED
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
BE
A
REAL
PAIN
WHEN
YOU
MAKE
A
CLAIM
I
HAVE
ALSO
HEARD
THAT
THEY
TRY
TO
GET
RID
OF
YOU
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
ACCIDENT
IM
INTERESTEND
IN
DETERMINING
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THESE
THINGS
ARE
TRUE
HAS
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
WITH
GEICO
MADE
A
CLAIM
ID
BE
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
WHETHER
OR
NOT
YOU
WERE
SATISFIED
WITH
THE
SERVICE
AND
WHETHER
YOU
THEN
HAD
TROUBLE
RENEWING
YOUR
POLICY
IM
ALSO
INTERESTED
IN
ANY
GOOD
OR
BAD
STORIES
ABOUT
LIBERTY
MUTUAL
OR
STATE
FARM
GEICO
SUPPORTS
READS
GIVES
TO
POLICE
LASER
RADARS
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
BE
VERY
PICKY
NO
SPORTS
CARS
NO
RADAR
DETECTORS
ALTHOUGH
MARYLAND
INSURANCE
BOARD
OVER
RULES
THIS
CONSISTANTLY
NO
TURBOS
BASICALLY
IT
SEEMS
IF
YOU
NEED
TO
USE
YOUR
INSURANCE
EVER
THEY
DONT
WANT
YOU
THEY
ONCE
TOLD
ME
THEY
WOULDNT
INSURE
ME
PERFECT
RECORD
BECAUSE
OF
MY
CORVETTE
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
WOULD
BE
INSURED
BY
ANOTHER
SPECIALTY
INSURANCE
WE
MUST
INSURE
ALL
THE
CARS
I
THINK
THIS
REP
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
SHE
WAS
TALKING
ABOUT
GEICO
IS
CHEAP
BUT
IF
YOU
EVER
FILE
A
CLAIM
BE
PREPARED
TO
BE
DROPPED
I
THINK
IN
MOST
AREAS
TWO
TICKETS
WILL
DO
IT
GEICO
WILL
NEVER
SEE
A
DIME
FROM
ME
IF
I
CAN
HELP
IT
STATE
FARM
SLIGHTY
HIGHER
THAN
MOST
BUT
VERY
GOOD
RESPONSE
NOT
AS
PICKY
AS
GEICO
