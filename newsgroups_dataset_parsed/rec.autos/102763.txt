CROSSPOSTING

OF

MOST
MISUNDERSTOOD

ON

YOU
SHOULD

BECAUSE
YOU
FEEL
AN

YOU
SHOULD
NEVER
CROSSPOST
JUST
TO

DISTINCTION

ARE
MOREORLESS
APPROPRIATE
IN

THEY
ARE
ALMOST
NEVER

THE
FACT
THAT

BEFORE

IF

CROSSPOST
CROSSPOSTING
BETWEEN

IS
CHANCY
AT
BEST
IN

FLAME
WARS
OVER
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
IN
THE

ANDOR
THE

DETECTORS
SHOULD
NEVER

CROSSPOSTED
BETWEEN

MOST
READERS

COULDNT
CARE
LESS
ABOUT
THE
POLICE
RADAR
AND
RADAR
DETECTOR
ARGUMENTS
THAT
GO
ON
ENDLESSLY
IN

IT
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
IDEA
TO
CHECK
THE
NEWSGROUPS
AND
FOLLOWUPTO
LINES
OF
ARTICLES
BEFORE
POSTING
A
FOLLOWUP
IN

BE
WARY
OF
POSTING
TO
MISCTEST
RECARTSSTARTREK
OR
TALKBIZARRE
OR
ANY
COMBINATION
OF
THESE
THREE
THE
LIFE
YOU
SAVE
MAY
BE
YOUR
OWN
DISTRIBUTION
THERE
IS
A
FIELD
IN
THE
HEADER
OF
ANY
NEWS
ARTICLE
WHICH
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
PARTIALLY
CONTROL
WHERE
THE
ARTICLE
GOES
IT
IS
CALLED
THE
DISTRIBUTION
FIELD
IT
MAY
BE
VERY
USEFUL
FOR
MANY
REASONS
IT
SHOULD
ALSO
SERVE
AS
A
REMINDER
THAT
NEWS
IS
A
VERY
LARGE
AND
WIDESPREAD
SYSTEM
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
RECAUTOS
IS
FAIRLY
EXTENSIVE
AS
OF
THIS
WRITING
THE
AUTOMOTIVE
NEWSGROUPS
ARE
KNOWN
TO
REACH
MOST
OF
EUROPE
AUSTRALIA
NEW
ZEALAND
AND
SOME
LOCATIONS
IN
JAPAN
WITH
THIS
IN
MIND
I
OFFER
THE
FOLLOWING
HINTS
ABOUT
USE
OF
THE
DISTRIBUTION
FIELD
IN
YOUR
ARTICLE
HEADERS
AND
ON
ARTICLE
CONTENT
PLEASE
TAKE
CARE
NOT
TO
SEND
FORSALE
ADS
ABOUT
CLAPPED
OUT
FORD
MAVERICKS
IN
NEW
JERSEY
TO
FRANCE
OR
CALIFORNIA
I
DOUBT
THAT
ANYONE
IN
EITHER
PLACE
WILL
CARE
EXCEPT
FOR
MY
GIRLFRIEND
WHO
FOR
SOME
STRANGE
REASON
LIKES
MAVERICKS
BUT
ONLY
MAVERICKS
AT
THAT
WHEN
POSTING
TECHNICAL
QUESTIONS
PLEASE
INCLUDE
THE
MARKET
FOR
WHICH
YOUR
CAR
WAS
MANUFACTURED
FOR
EXAMPLE
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
A
EUROPEANMARKET
FORD
ESCORT
AND
A
USMARKET
ESCORT
LIKEWISE
ALL
AND
EARLY
ALFA
ROMEOS
REACHED
THE
US
WITH
SPICA
FUEL
INJECTION
EUROPEAN
MARKET
CARS
USUALLY
GOT
CARBS
OFTEN
WEBERS
THESE
DIFFERENCES
CAN
BE
IMPORTANT
TO
YOUR
READERS
MAKE
YOUR
SITUATION
CLEAR
FAILURE
TO
DO
SO
CAN
LEAD
TO
POINTLESS
FLAME
WARS
AND
A
SIGNIFICANT
SPREAD
OF
MISINFORMATION
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
YOUR
CAPACITIES
AND
SPECIFICATIONS
WHEN
POSTING
IN
THE
US
WE
GET
A
MIX
OF
METRIC
AND
ENGLISH
SYSTEM
VALUES
WHEREAS
EUROPE
IS
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
ON
THE
METRIC
SYSTEM
A
FUTURE
EDITION
OF
THIS
MONTHLY
POSTING
WILL
CONTAIN
A
LIST
OF
COMMONLYUSED
ABBREVIATIONS
THAT
MAY
NOT
BE
KNOWN
IN
SOME
PLACES
THAT
RECAUTOS
REACHES
THIS
CUTS
BOTH
WAYS
SO
LET
US
NOT
BE
PAROCHIAL
ABOUT
IT
USE
THE
DISTRIBUTION
FIELD
TO
LIMIT
WHERE
YOUR
ARTICLE
GOES
WHEN
POSSIBLE
WITHIN
NORTH
AMERICA
THE
VALUES
NA
NORTH
AMERICA
CAN
CANADA
AND
USA
MAY
BE
USED
IN
ADDITION
THE
TWOLETTER
STATE
ABBREVIATIONS
OF
THE
US
ARE
SUPPORTED
IN
SOME
CASES
EG
IF
I
WANTED
TO
SEND
AN
ARTICLE
ONLY
TO
NEW
YORK
AND
NEW
JERSEY
I
COULD
PUT
NYNJ
IN
A
DISTRIBUTION
FIELD
NOTE
THAT
MULTIPLE
COMMASEPARATED
VALUES
ARE
LEGAL
THESE
DISTRIBUTION
FIELDS
VARY
WIDELY
HOWEVER
SO
YOU
SHOULD
CHECK
WITH
YOUR
LOCAL
SYSADMIN
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
SUPPORTED
IN
YOUR
AREA
THE
DANGERS
OF

OF
MAKING
FOOLISH
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
ALL

WHAT

TRUE
FOR
A

WITH

MAY
BE
QUITE
UTTERLY

FOR
A

HEADLIGHT
LAWS
IN

ARE
DECIDEDLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THOSE
IN

THE
NEED
FOR
ADEQUATE

WHEN
YOU
ASK
A

PLEASE
GIVE
A
REASONABLE
AMOUNT
OF

EG
IF
YOU
HAVE
A

ABOUT
YOUR

PLEASE
SPECIFY

ETC
OTHERWISE
MOST

TO
YOUR

MAY

QUITE

AT

EVERY

HAS

OR

EVEN

ADMITS

PLEASE
DONT

EVERYONES
TIME
BY
ANNOUNCING
TO
THE
WORLD
THAT
YOUR
BRAND
X

TERRIBLE
SO
ALL

SO
NO
ONE
SHOULD
EVER
BUY
A

FROM
THE

X
COMPANY
SUCH

ARE
WORSE
THAN
USELESS
BECAUSE
THEY
CAUSE
SUBSTANTIAL
WASTED
BANDWIDTH
