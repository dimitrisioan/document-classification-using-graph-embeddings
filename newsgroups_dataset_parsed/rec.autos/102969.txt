re
its
a
rush
was
re
too
fast
wharf
wrat
rites
they
were
designed
for
speeds
of
upwards
of
i
forget
the
exact
spec
but
for
military
vehicles
thats
in
a
dodge
powerwagon
not
in
a
ford
taurus
ever
once
in
a
while
you
still
see
a
reference
to
the
super
slab
system
as
interstate
and
defense
highways
but
whether
the
military
has
much
of
anything
that
goes
on
the
road
is
another
matter
a
few
of
their
most
whompedup
diesel
trucks
maybe
load
permitting
the
military
surplus
stuff
ive
driven
jeep
classic
willyskaiseramc
preindependent
suspension
and
power
wagons
slant
in
a
crewcab
pickup
werent
exactly
congenial
at
highway
speeds
and
i
wouldnt
swear
any
of
them
would
do
except
as
a
bedload
on
a
semi
you
just
gotta
love
the
standard
military
tire
too
or
at
least
the
one
they
used
to
use
designed
circa
ww
ii
as
a
compromise
between
traction
in
icky
sticky
goo
and
longevity
on
sharp
rocks
and
so
forth
its
quite
illadapted
to
high
speeds
on
civilian
roadways
for
those
who
cant
remember
what
they
look
like
imagine
a
mountainbike
tire
with
a
road
rib
in
the
middle
scaled
up
to
car
size
oh
yeah
and
narrow
too
one
of
the
standard
mods
for
civilizing
a
surplus
jeep
was
to
install
tires
and
wheels
that
reflected
some
of
the
advancements
made
in
ride
and
handling
since
dday
but
the
point
made
by
wharfie
and
others
still
stands
if
youre
going
to
do
in
a
milspec
power
wagon
or
a
jeep
or
a
tank
transporter
or
other
unwieldy
rubbertired
vehicle
anywhere
id
suggest
the
american
interstate
your
safe
speed
there
tends
to
be
limited
more
by
your
car
and
skills
road
maintenance
and
the
swarms
of
fools
around
you
the
roads
were
designed
for
going
like
the
devil
naturally
neither
i
nor
my
employer
advocates
unsafe
or
unlawful
driving
joe
just
another
personal
opinion
from
the
peoples
