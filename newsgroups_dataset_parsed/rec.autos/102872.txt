LH
WORKMANSHIP

ARTICLE
JCHENCTTBELLCORECOM
WRITES
I
JUST
VISITED
THE
NY
AUTO
SHOW
AND
SAW
TWO
LH
CARS
ON
THE
FLOOR
EAGLE
VISION
AND
DODGE
INTREPID
REALLY
NICE
I
MUST
SAY
VERY
ATTRACTIVE
STYLING
LOTS
OF
FEATURES
AND
ROOM
AT
A
COMPETITIVE
PRICE
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
WORKMANSHIP
IS
QUITE
DISAPPOINTING
ON
BOTH
CARS
THE
RUBBER
SEALS
AROUND
THE
WINDOW
AND
DOOR
FELL
OFF
IT
TURNS
OUT
THE
SEALS
ARE
JUST
BIG
GROOVED
RUBBER
BAND
IT
GOES
ON
JUST
BY
PRESSING
THE
GROOVE
AGAINST
THE
TONGUE
ON
THE
DOOR
FRAME
SURELY
IT
WOULD
COME
OFF
EASILY
LACK
OF
BUILD
QUALITY
WAS
THE
THING
I
NOTCED
ON
THE
FIRST
LHS
I
SAW
MONTHS
BACK
THE
PANEL
GAPS
WERE
LARGE
AND
NONUNIFORM
BETWEEN
THE
CARS
I
SAW
THE
KIND
OF
THING
YOU
EXPECT
AND
ACCEPT
ON
A
MUSTANG
BUT
NOT
FROM
CHRYSLERS
SAVIOR
I
DROVE
ONE
OF
THE
LOW
END
CARS
AND
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
MORE
THAN
ADEQUATE
ID
PREFER
AN
LH
TO
A
TAURUS
FROM
MY
BRIEF
EXPERIENCE
CRAIG
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
MANY
OF
THIS
KIND
OF
POORING
ENGINEERINGASSEMBLY
PROBLEMS
THAT
WILL
SHOW
UP
LATER
I
MAY
STILL
CONSIDER
BUYING
IT
BUT
ONLY
WHEN
IT
ESTABLISHES
A
GOOD
TRACK
RECORD
