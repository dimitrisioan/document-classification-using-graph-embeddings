SAYS
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
IM
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
TRANNIES
USED
IN
WINSTON
CUP
BUT
IN
THE
TRANSAM
CARS
IVE
PLAYED
WITH
THE
TRANSMISSIONS
WERE
THE
RACING
VARIETY
WITH
DOG
CLUTCHES
INSTEAD
OF
SYCHROS
IN
A
TRANSMISSION
WITH
DOG
CLUTCHES
THE
GEARS
ARE
ALWAYS
ENGAGED
WITH
EACH
OTHER
AND
MOVING
THE
DOG
CLUTCHES
ENGAGES
THE
GEARS
TO
THE
SHAFTS
MOTORCYCLE

SHIFTING
WITHOUT
THE

ON

SAME

ME

FACT
WHAT
LITTLE
IVE
STUDIED
ON
TRANNIES
THE
INSTRUCTOR
REFERRED
TO
THE
SYNCHROS
AS
DOGS
AND
SAID
THEY
WERE
SYNONYMOUS
THE
GEARS
ARE
ALWAYS
MESHED
IN
A
SYNCHRONIZED
GEARBOX
AND
YOU
SLIP
THE
SYNCHRO
GEARS
BACK
AND
FORTH
BY
SHIFTING
OR
AT
LEAST
THAT
IS
WHAT
I
WAS
TAUGHT
EXPLAIN
POR
FAVOUR
THANX
DREW

FINE
IF
THIS
IS
INAPPROPRIATE
FOR

OR
IF
IM

WHO
DOESNT
KNOW
