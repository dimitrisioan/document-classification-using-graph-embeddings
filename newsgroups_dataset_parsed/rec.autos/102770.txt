Q
WHAT
IS
A
REVMATCHED
DOWNSHIFT
A
WHEN
DOWNSHIFTING
THE
ENGINE
MUST
BE
ROTATING
FASTER
IN
THE
LOWER
GEAR
THAN
IT
WAS
IN
THE
HIGHER
GEAR
HOWEVER
DURING
A
DOWNSHIFT
NORMALLY
YOU
DECLUTCH
AND
LIFT
YOUR
FOOT
FROM
THE
THROTTLE
SO
THE
REVS
DROP
RATHER
THAN
INCREASE
IN
REVMATCHED
DOWNSHIFT
YOU
BLIP
THE
THROTTLE
BEFORE
REENGAGING
THE
CLUTCH
SO
THAT
THE
ENGINE
WILL
ALREADY
BE
UP
TO
THE
NEW
SPEED
THIS
RESULTS
IN
A
MUCH
SMOOTHER
AND
FASTER
DOWNSHIFT
Q
WHAT
DOES
HEELANDTOE
MEAN
A
HEELANDTOE
IS
A
TECHNIQUE
USED
TO
DO
A
REVMATCHED
DOWNSHIFT
WHILE
BRAKING
THIS
IS
NORMALLY
CHALLENGING
BECAUSE
YOU
NEED
THE
RIGHT
FOOT
FOR
BOTH
THE
BRAKE
AND
THROTTLE
IT
IS
CALLED
HEELANDTOE
BECAUSE
YOU
USE
ONE
END
OF
THE
FOOT
ON
THE
BRAKE
AND
THE
OTHER
ON
THE
THROTTLE
TO
MATCH
REVS
FOR
THE
DOWNSHIFT
IN
MANY
MODERN
CARS
THIS
IS
A
MISNOMER
OFTEN
YOU
MUST
USE
THE
BALL
OF
THE
FOOT
ON
THE
BRAKE
AND
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
ON
THE
THROTTLE
NOTE
THAT
SOME
RACE
CAR
DRIVERS
WILL
SKIP
THE
CLUTCH
AND
JUST
USE
THE
LEFT
FOOT
ON
THE
BRAKE
AND
THE
RIGHT
FOOT
ON
THE
THROTTLE
ACCOMPLISHING
THE
SAME
THING
Q
WHAT
IS
DOUBLECLUTCH
DOWNSHIFTING
A
WHILE
YOUR
RIGHT
FOOT
IS
DOING
THE
ABOVE
YOUR
LEFT
FOOT
CAN
DO
ONE
OF
THREE
THINGS
NOTHING
DECLUTCH
ONCE
OR
DECLUTCH
TWICE
THE
REASON
FOR
DECLUTCHING
TWICE
IS
TO
MATCH
THE
SPEEDS
OF
THE
TWO
SHAFTS
IN
THE
TRANSMISSION
TO
THE
SPEED
OF
THE
ENGINE
THIS
IS
USUALLY
COUPLED
WITH
REVMATCHING
SO
THAT
WHILE
THE
ENGINE
IS
IN
NEUTRAL
AND
THE
CLUTCH
ENGAGED
THE
THROTTLE
IS
BLIPPED
AND
BOTH
SHAFTS
OF
THE
TRANSMISSION
SPEED
UP
THE
PROCEDURE
IS
AS
FOLLOWS
DECLUTCH
MOVE
GEARSHIFT
LEVER
TO
NEUTRAL
ENGAGE
CLUTCH
MATCH
REVS
DECLUTCH
MOVE
GEARSHIFT
LEVER
TO
NEXT
LOWER
GEAR
ENGAGE
CLUTCH
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
LOT
OF
WORK
BUT
WITH
PRACTICE
IT
BECOMES
NATURAL
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
DOUBLECLUTCHING
SOLVES
IS
NORMALLY
THE
FUNCTION
OF
THE
SYNCHRONIZERS
WITHIN
THE
GEARBOX
IN
TRANSMISSIONS
WITHOUT
SYNCHROS
OR
WITH
VERY
WORN
SYNCHROS
DOUBLECLUTCHING
MAKES
IT
MUCH
EASIER
TO
SHIFT
BASICALLY
IF
YOU
DOUBLECLUTCH
WELL
YOU
ARE
NOT
USING
THE
SYNCHROS
AT
ALL
THIS

ALMOST
NEVER

THAT

HOWEVER
SKIDPADS
ARE
AN

THEY
