q
where
are

illegal
a
in
the

currently
virgina
and
the
district
of
columbia
prohibit
all
usage
of

ontario
quebec
newfoundland
and
pei
prince
edward
island
they
are
apparently
are
illegal
through
most
if
not
all
of
europe
legislation
which
would
make
them
illegal
is
pending
in
many
other
jurisdictions
chances
of
such
legislation
passing
varies
a
great
deal
q
where
are
radar
detector
detectors
used
do
they
really
work
a
usage
is
spreading
rapidly
initially
they
were
used
only
in
canada
but
now
they
are
appearing
in
new
york
and
virginia
it
is
unsafe
to
assume
that
they
are
not
in
use
in
connecticut
and
dc
they
work
by
detecting
a
certain
frequency
radiated
by
many
currently
available
super
het
radar
detectors
some
brands
of
detector
radiate
more
strongly
than
others
and
are
thus
more
likely
to
be
spotted
new
radar
detectors
are
becoming
available
which
may
not
be
detected
by
the
current
generation
of
detector
detectors
note
that
a
detector
may
only
be
spotted
by
one
of
these
devices
if
it
is
turned
on
q
what
is
vascar
is
it
some
kind
of
radar
a
vascar
is
nothing
more
than
a
fancy
stopwatch
and
timespeeddistance
computer
it
depends
on
the
operator
pressing
buttons
as
the
target
vehicle
passes
landmarks
no
radar
signals
are
emitted
by
a
vascar
system
q
what
is
ka
band
radar
where
is
it
used
should
a
radar
detector
be
able
to
handle
it
a
ka
band
has
recently
been
made
available
by
the
fcc
for
use
in
the
us
in
socalled
photoradar
installations
in
these
installations
a
lowpowered
beam
is
aimed
across
the
road
at
a
degree
angle
to
the
direction
of
traffic
and
a
picture
is
taken
of
vehicles
which
the
radar
unit
determines
to
have
been
in
violation
of
the
speed
limit
tickets
are
mailed
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
because
of
the
low
power
and
the
degree
angle
many
people
believe
that
a
radar
detector
cannot
give
reasonable
warning
of
a
ka
band
radar
unit
although
some
manufacturers
of
radar
detectors
have
added
such
capability
anyway
the
number
of
locales
where
photoradar
is
in
use
is
limited
and
some
question
the
legality
of
such
units
best
advice
learn
what
photo
radar
units
look
like
and
keep
track
of
where
they
are
used
or

q
do
radar
jammers
work
are
they
legal
a
quick
answer
no
and
not
in
the
usa
detailed
answer
cheap
radar
jammers
do
not
work
well
at
all
jammers
that
work
are
expensive
and
usually
the
property
of
the
military
jammers
are
a
major

questions
q
what
are
understeer
and
oversteer
a
understeer
and
oversteer
are
terms
describing
the
behaviour
of
a
car
while
cornering
near
the
limit
limit
of
adhesion
that
is
most
drivers
do
not
normally
drive
hard
enough
for
these
terms
to
be
descriptive
of
the
situations
they
encounter
simply
put
they
tell
whether
the
car
wants
to
go
straight
in
a
corner
steer
less
or
understeer
or
it
wants
to
turn
more
in
a
corner
oversteer
understeer
is
commonly
designed
into
most
production
cars
so
that
untrained
drivers
inadvertantly
traveling
too
fast
wont
get
into
trouble
understeer
may
also
be
induced
by
using
too
much
throttle
in
a
corner
oversteer
is
designed
into
some
more
performance
oriented
cars
it
may
be
induced
by
lifting
on
the
throttle
trailing
throttle
oversteer
or
tto
in
extreme
cases
lifting
on
the
throttle
may
induce
so
much
oversteer
that
the
car
reacts
by
fishtailing
or
spinning
some
technical
details
in
a
corner
at
speed
the
tires
on
the
car
will
develop
what
are
called
slip
angles
the
slip
angle
is
the
angular
difference
between
the
direction
that
the
car
is
traveling
and
the
direction
that
the
steering
wheel
is
directing
the
car
to
travel
in
understeer
the
front
wheels
have
a
greater
slip
angle
than
the
rear
wheels
in
oversteer
the
rear
wheels
have
a
greater
slip
angle
than
the
front
wheels
q
what
is
a
revmatched
downshift
a
when
downshifting
the
engine
must
be
rotating
faster
in
the
lower
gear
than
it
was
in
the
higher
gear
however
during
a
downshift
normally
you
declutch
and
lift
your
foot
from
the
throttle
so
the
revs
drop
rather
than
increase
in
revmatched
downshift
you
blip
the
throttle
before
reengaging
the
clutch
so
that
the
engine
will
already
be
up
to
the
new
speed
this
results
in
a
much
smoother
and
faster
downshift
q
what
does
heelandtoe
mean
a
heelandtoe
is
a
technique
used
to
do
a
revmatched
downshift
while
braking
this
is
normally
challenging
because
you
need
the
right
foot
for
both
the
brake
and
throttle
it
is
called
heelandtoe
because
you
use
one
end
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
other
on
the
throttle
to
match
revs
for
the
downshift
in
many
modern
cars
this
is
a
misnomer
often
you
must
use
the
ball
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
side
on
the
throttle
note
that
some
race
car
drivers
will
skip
the
clutch
and
just
use
the
left
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
foot
on
the
throttle
accomplishing
the
same
thing
q
what
is
doubleclutch
downshifting
a
while
your
right
foot
is
doing
the
above
your
left
foot
can
do
one
of
three
things
nothing
declutch
once
or
declutch
twice
the
reason
for
declutching
twice
is
to
match
the
speeds
of
the
two
shafts
in
the
transmission
to
the
speed
of
the
engine
this
is
usually
coupled
with
revmatching
so
that
while
the
engine
is
in
neutral
and
the
clutch
engaged
the
throttle
is
blipped
and
both
shafts
of
the
transmission
speed
up
the
procedure
is
as
follows
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
neutral
engage
clutch
match
revs
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
next
lower
gear
engage
clutch
this
sounds
like
a
lot
of
work
but
with
practice
it
becomes
natural
the
problem
that
doubleclutching
solves
is
normally
the
function
of
the
synchronizers
within
the
gearbox
in
transmissions
without
synchros
or
with
very
worn
synchros
doubleclutching
makes
it
much
easier
to
shift
basically
if
you
doubleclutch
well
you
are
not
using
the
synchros
at
all
this
is
generally
unnecessary
on
street
cars
with
synchros
in
good
condition
q
what
do
the
numbers
for
acceleration
from
mile
skidpad
and
slalom
times
in
the
auto
magazines
really
mean
may
they
be
compared
a
in
short
not
as
much
as
the
magazines
want
you
to
believe
and
almost
never
in
more
detail
the
acceleration
numbers
and
mile
times
in
the
us
may
be
vaguely
compared
as
long
as
they
all
come
from
the
same
source
testing
procedures
vary
so
much
from
magazine
to
magazine
that
comparing
a
road
track
number
to
a
car
driver
number
is
quite
pointless
keep
in
mind
too
that
the
same
variation
applies
from
driver
to
driver
on
the
street
the
driver
is
a
major
often
the
major
part
of
the
equation
skidpads
vary
and
even
if
they
didnt
skidpad
figures
are
really
only
tests
of
the
stickiness
of
the
stock
tires
they
change
radically
when
tire
compounds
change
do
not
make
any
assumptions
about
the
comparative
handling
of
say
two
sports
sedans
based
on
skidpad
numbers
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
skidpads
are
without
value
however
skidpads
are
an
excellent
educational
tool
at
driving
schools
they
are
simply
of
limited
value
in
the
comparison
of
anything
except
tires
slalom
times
are
slightly
more
useful
they
test
some
small
parts
of
the
automobiles
transient
response
however
they
are
also
heavily
influenced
by
the
stock
rubber
on
the
car
and
they
do
not
test
many
corners
of
the
cars
envelope
they
do
not
tell
you
all
you
need
to
know
before
making
a
buying
decision
for
example
they
dont
tell
you
what
the
rear
end
of
the
car
will
do
on
a
road
which
suddenly
goes
offcamber
when
a
car
has
an
adjustable
suspension
these
tests
are
usually
done
in
the
sport
setting
which
may
be
quite
unsuitable
for
daily
driving
the
list
of
caveats
could
go
on

q
my
buddy
claims
that
wide
tires
dont
make
any
difference
according
to
his
freshman
physics
textbook
and
that
you
cant
ever
accelerate
or
corner
at
more
than
does
he
know
what
hes
talking
about
a
in
short
he
hasnt
got
a
clue
in
more
detail
the
equations
for
friction
used
in
freshman
physics
textbooks
presume
that
the
surfaces
are
smooth
dry
and
nondeformable
none
of
which
properly
apply
to
tire
traction
except
in
the
case
of
a
stone
cold
tire
on
dry
pavement
which
is
far
below
its
proper
operating
temperature
pavement
is
never
smooth
it
is
always
irregular
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
tires
which
are
not
really
dry
and
solid
as
rubber
is
a
substance
which
in
its
natural
form
is
liquid
and
which
has
only
been
coerced
into
a
semblance
of
solidity
by
chemical
magic
deform
to
match
the
surface
of
the
pavement
which
a
vehicle
is
traveling
over
in
a
tire
at
operating
temperature
grip
is
actually
generated
by
shear
stresses
inside
the
deformed
rubber
and
not
by
anything
even
remotely
resembling
friction
in
the
freshman
physics
sense
of
the
term
the
colder
a
tire
is
relative
to
its
operating
temperature
the
closer
its
behaviour
will
be
to
the
traditional
concept
of
friction
if
much
hotter
than
the
its
proper
operating
temperature
the
more
likely
the
possibility
of
some
part
of
the
tire
actually
reverting
to
liquid
which
is
mostly
like
to
happen
deep
in
the
tread
causing
characteristic
blisters
and
chunking
this
latter
though
is
almost
completely
unlikely
to
happen
in
normal
street
driving
so
unless
youre
a
competition
driver
or
do
a
lot
of
high
speed
track
driving
dont
worry
about
it
because
tire
traction
is
completely
out
of
the
domain
of
simple
friction
it
does
not
obey
the
freshman
physics
equation
at
all
thus
dragsters
accelerate
at
more
than
and
race
cars
corner
and
brake
at
more
than
because
simple
friction
does
not
apply
it
is
actually
possible
for
different
sized
contact
patches
to
generate
differing
amounts
of
grip
an
actual
analysis
of
tire
behavior
would
require
techniques
such
as
finite
element
analysis
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
mechanism
