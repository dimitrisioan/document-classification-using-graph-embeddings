i
am
in
the
process
of
buying
a
new
auto
i
havent
decided
yet
whether
i
should
sell
my
current
car
myself
or
trade
it
in
as
part
of
the
new
auto
purchase
i
know
that
the
blue
book
value
for
the
car
is
an
acquaintence
has
offered
to
give
me
blue
book
value
for
the
car
i
am
just
wondering
if
this
is
a
standard
measure
for
negotiating
a
resale
price
or
if
i
can
hope
to
get
more
money
from
someone
else
what
exactly
is
blue
book
value
based
on
i
know
that
for
its
year
my
car
has
low
mileage
it
is
in
excellent
working
condition
but
does
have
a
few
dings
on
the
exterior
nothing
major
do
any
of
these
facts
alter
the
fair
selling
price
of
the
car
i
am
not
looking
to
rip
anyone
off
i
just
naturally
want
to
get
the
best
price
for
the
car
thanks
a
million
veek
a
dealer
will
make
money
off
you
in
three
ways
if
you
let
him
new
car
markup
over
his
cost
remember
his
holdback
arranging
financing
through
the
dealership
and
screwing
you
on
the
trade
keep
the
deal
with
the
dealer
simple
by
eliminating
buying
a
car
at
dealers
cost
is
meaningless
if
he
makes
on
the
trade
andor
gets
a
kickback
from
the
bank
blue
book
you
need
to
know
if
youre
talking
average
wholesale
or
average
retail
is
a
good
guide
to
value
for
a
car
if
you
are
selling
it
yourself
try
to
get
average
retail
and
chances
are
youll
have
done
ok
be
careful
selling
to
acquaintances
if
you
ever
want
them
to
become
friends
