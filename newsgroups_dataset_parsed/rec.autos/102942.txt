hatch
has

up
im
waiting

my

on
the
corner
horn
buttons
behind
air
bag
in
spokes
and
not
in
center
personal
preference
the
latter
is
probably
because
of
the
air
bag
its
pretty
much
takes
up
all
the
space
where
youd
expect
to
find
the
horn

toyotas
have
airbags
with
a
real
horn
come

how
hard
can
it
be
to
put
a
little
pressure
plate
there
i
hope
toyota
doesnt
follow
everyone
else
and
make
the
horns
little
buttons
that
i
wouldnt
want
