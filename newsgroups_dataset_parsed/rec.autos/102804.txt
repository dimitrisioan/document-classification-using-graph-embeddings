cruiser
worth
it
in
response
to
a
post
about
suvs
i
got
several
unsolicited
recommendations
to
check
out
the
land
cruiser
despite
its
astronomical
price
the
toyota
dealer
told
me
its
a
cult
car
if
a
car
is
good
enough
to
create
a
passionate
and
loyal
following
there
must
be
something
really
extraordinary
about
it
so
all
you
land
crusher
cultists
here
is
your
chance
to
convert
