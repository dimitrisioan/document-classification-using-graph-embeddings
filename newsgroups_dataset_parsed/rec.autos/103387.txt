RE
THE
MUSTANG

FORD
TO
THE

WITH
THE
CAMAROFIREBIRD

REALLY
ONLY
IN
WORDS
PRODUCTION
OF
THESE
VEHICLES
WILL
BE
LIMITED
UNTIL
THE
END
OF
THE
YEAR
KEEPING
SELLING
PRICES
ABOVE
MSRP
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
SINCE
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
TWITCHING
CAMARO
FANS

TRANS
AM
WEEKS
AFTER
I
ORDERED
PROMISED
WEEKS
AND
PAID
OVER
DEALER
INVOICE
WHICH
IS
A
DISCOUNT
OFF

I
ONLY
HAVE
ABOUT

VERY
WELL
PUT
TOGETHER

FIRST
YEAR
PRODUCTION
WILL
BE
ABOUT

ALTHOUGH
THEY
DESCRIBED
IT

A
SERIOUSLY

IT
LOOKED
PRETTY
BORING
