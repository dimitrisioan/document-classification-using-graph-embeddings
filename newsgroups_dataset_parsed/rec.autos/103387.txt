re
the
mustang
they
beat
ford
to
the
market
with
the
camarofirebird
but
really
only
in
words
production
of
these
vehicles
will
be
limited
until
the
end
of
the
year
keeping
selling
prices
above
msrp
for
the
most
part
since
there
are
so
many
twitching
camaro
fans
out
there
drivel
i
received
delivery
of
my
trans
am
weeks
after
i
ordered
promised
weeks
and
paid
over
dealer
invoice
which
is
a
discount
off
of
msrp
i
only
have
about
miles
on
it
but
so
far
no
problems
and
it
seems
very
well
put
together
by
the
way
first
year
production
will
be
about
cars
dealers
would
like
you
to
think
there
is
a
shortage
but
considering
they
only
sold
about
f
bodies
last
year
and
the
new
model
was
introduced
midyear
that
is
not
going
to
create
a
shortage
gm
planning
on
ramping
to
about
f
bodies
next
year
according
to
a
wsj
article
several
people
have
mentioned
seeing
a
photo
of
the
mustang
in
popular
mechanics
i
saw
a
photo
of
it
in
motor
trend
january
issue
direct
side
on
view
although
they
described
it
as
a
seriously
handsome
car
with
broad
shoulders
i
thought
it
looked
pretty
boring
in
that
view
roofline
reminded
me
of
a
toyota
celica
yuch
description
of
mechanicals
same
as
has
been
reported
from
the
pm
