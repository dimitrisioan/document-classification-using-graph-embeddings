ITS
A
BIG
AFTERMARKET
BUSINESS
ALMOST
NO
CARS
COME
FROM
THE
FACTORY
WITH
VYNAL
ANY
MORE
AND
ANY
FAKE
CONVERTIBLE
JOB
DEFINITELY
CAME
FROM
SOME
AFTERMARKET
PLACE
WHAT
AMAZES
ME
IS
HOW
MUCH
PEOPLE
ARE
WILLING
TO
PAY
FOR
BAD
TASTE
HOW
ABOUT
THOSE
REALLY
UGLY
FAKE
WHEEL
COMPARTMENTS
STUCK
ONTO
THE
TRUNK
OR
SIDE
OR
BOTH
SIDES
OF
SOME
TACKY

SOME

ARENT
FAKE
IF
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
CONTINENTAL
KIT
NAMED
AFTER
THE
LINCOLN
CONTINENTAL
THE
FIRST
CAR
TO
SPORT
ONE
I
PERSONALLY
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HAVE
A
TBIRD
WITH
A
CONTINENTAL
KIT
AND
THE
SUPERCHARGED
THAT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
CARS
EVER
BUILT
IMHO
JAMES
THE
CONTINENTAL
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
FIRST
MODERN
ERA
AUTO
TO
MOUNT
THE
SPARE
ON
THE
REAR
OF
THE
CAR
BUT
IT
WAS
HARDLY
THE
FIRST
CAR
TO
SPORT
ONE
VARIOUS
MOUNTING
TECHNIQUES
FOR
REAR
MOUNTING
THE
SPARE
WERE
QUITE
COMMON
IN
EARLY
AUTOMOBILES
BOTH
US
AND
FOREIGN
RIGHT
IN
THE
THIRTIES
BOTH
BUICK
AND
PACKARD
HAD
TWO
SPARES
MOUNTED
IN
WELLS
IN
THE
FRONT
FENDERS
OF
COURSE
THAT
WAS
BACK
WHEN
THE
FRONT
FENDERS
WERE
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
PROVIDE
ROOM
THERE
WERE
A
COUPLE
OF
OTHER
MARQUES
THAT
DID
THIS
AS
WELL
BUT
MEMORY
FADES
KEN
FRANKLIN
THEY
SAY
THERES
A
HEAVEN
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
WAIT
AMA
AND
SOME
SAY
ITS
BETTER
BUT
I
SAY
IT
AINT
GWRRA
ID
RATHER
LAUGH
WITH
THE
SINNERS
THAN
CRY
WITH
THE
SAINTS
DOD
THE
SINNERS
ARE
LOTS
MORE
FUN
YKNOW
ONLY
THE
GOOD
DIE
YOUNG
