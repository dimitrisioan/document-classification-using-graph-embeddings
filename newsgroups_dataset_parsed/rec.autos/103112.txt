DIFFERENCES
IN
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
RATES
I
AM
CONSIDERING
BUYING
AN
NEW
CAR
SO
I
CALLED
THREE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
IN
CALIFORNIA
TO
GET
ESTIMATES
I
ASKED
FOR
THE
SAME
COVERAGE
AND
SAME
DEDUCTIBLES
MOST
OF
THE
COMPANIES
CHARGE
YOU
ACCORDING
TO
YOUR
ZIP
CODE
OTHERS
CHARGE
ACCORDING
TO
YOUR
CITY
ANYHOW
I
GAVE
THE
SAME
ZIP
CODE
AND
CITY
TO
ALL
THREE
PLACES
HERES
WHAT
I
FOUND
FOR
A
INTEGRA
GS
AAA
STATE
FARM
ALLSTATE
AAA
IS
NONPROFIT
SO
THEY
SAID
I
COULD
ALSO
EXPECT
TO
RECEIVE
ABOUT
BACK
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
YEAR
STILL
THERE
IS
A
HUGE
GAP
BETWEEN
ALL
OF
THESE
COMPANIES
STATE
FARM
WANTS
MORE
THAN
TWICE
AS
MUCH
AS
ALLSTATE
I
THINK
I
SHOULD
BE
SUSPICIOUS
BUT
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
ANYBODY
ELSE
COMPLAIN
ANY
COMMENTS
THANKS
