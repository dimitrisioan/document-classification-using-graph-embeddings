I
HEARD
THE
DIESELS
ARE
CONSIDERED
CLEANERBURNING
THAN
GAS
ENGINES
BECAUSE
THE
EMIT
LESS
OF
CARBON
MONOXIDE
HYDROCARBONS
AND
OXIDES
OF
NITROGEN
CO
HC
NOX
BUT
THEY
CAN
PUT
OUT
A
LOT
OF
PARTICULATE
MATTER
I
HEARD
SOMETHING
ABOUT
LEGISLATION
BEING
DISCUSSED
TO
CLEAN
UP
DIESEL
EMISSIONS
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
IN
THE
WORKS
TO
INSTALL
SCRUBBERS
FOR
DIESELS
HOW
ABOUT
THE
FEASIBILITY
OF
INSTALLING
THEM
ON
TRUCKS
AND
CARS
WOULD
IT
BE
ANY
DIFFERENT
THAN
A
CATYLITIC
CONVERTER
ID
ASSUME
EASIER
SINCE
WERE
REMOVING
PARTICULATE
MATTER
INSTEAD
OF
CONVERTING
GASSES
LETS
HEAR
PEOPLES
OPINIONS
THIS
REALLY
BUGS
ME
THE
EMISSIONS
OF
DIESELS
ARE
THE
CLEANEST
OF
ANY
VECHICLE
BUT
THEY
ARE
CONSIDERED
SO
POLLUTING
THAT
THEY
ARE
BANNED
IN
PASSENGER
CARS
IN
CALIFORNIA
WHAT
A
BUNCH
OF
CRAP
DIESEL
IS
THE
FUEL
OF
CHOICE
FOR
ENVIROMENTAL
BENEFIT
IN
EUROPE
WHILE
HERE
ITS
ILLEGAL
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
THE
PARTICULATES
ARE
NOTHING
BUT
CARBON
THEY
ARE
JUST
AN
ANNOYANCE
AT
WORST
NOTHING
BEATS
THE
DIESEL
CYCLE
FOR
EFFICIENCY
AND
EMISSIONS
TORQUE
OR
ENGINE
DURABILITY
ITS
ALSO
CHEAPER
JUST
TO
CLEAR
THINGS
UP
AS
TO
WHY
I
POSTED
THE
QUESTION
THAT
WAY
I
WAS
DEBATING
WITH
A
COWORKER
ABOUT
DIESELS
I
CLAIMED
THEY
WERE
CLEANERBURNING
THAN
GAS
ENGINES
HE
SAID
THE
EXTRA
JUNK
PUT
OUT
BY
THEM
WAS
OFFSET
BY
THE
SAVINGS
IN
GREENHOUSE
GASSES
I
MADE
ALL
THE
SAME
CLAIMS
YOU
DID
BUT
ONE
QUESTION
OF
HIS
WAS
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
CARBON
I
SAID
IT
WAS
HARMLESS
BUT
HE
WANTED
TO
KNOW
HOW
TO
GET
RID
OF
IT
I
SUGGESTED
SCRUBBERS
I
FIGURED
IT
WOULD
BE
NO
HARDER
OR
MORE
EXPENSIVE
TO
INSTALL
THAN
CATS
DOES
THERE
EXIST
ANY
DESIGNS
FOR
A
SCRUBBER
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
JUST
TO
ANSWER
HIS
FINAL
QUESTION
I
CONVINCED
HIM
THAT
DIESELS
ARE
CLEANER
OTHERWISE
BTW
I
NAMED
MY
SUBJECT
DIRTY
DIESELS
BECAUSE
I
KNEW
IT
WOULD
GET
A
REACTION
OUT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
KNEW
THEY
WERE
CLEANER
THAN
GAS
ENGINES
AND
THAT
