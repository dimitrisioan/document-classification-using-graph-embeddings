society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
i
think
this
is
getting
a
little
overheated
highway
robbers
have
been
a
part
of
life
since
the
middle
ages
at
least
its
human
nature
to
look
at
history
through
rose
colored
glasses
but
random
acts
of
violence
have
been
a
ceaseless
part
of
our
heritage
overall
life
is
better
now
than
it
ever
was
then
its
just
that
random
individual
acts
of
violence
have
never
been
historically
significant
and
record
keeping
in
the
past
was
never
good
enough
to
retain
them
