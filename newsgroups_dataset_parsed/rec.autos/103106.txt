ITS
A

TOO
FAST

GARY
W
MAHAN
SAYS
WHY
SHOULD
A
GOOD
DRIVER
BE
TERRIFIED
AT
THE
ONLY
THING
I
FEAR
GOING
AT
ARE
DRIVERS
WHO
SWITCH
TO
THE
LEFT
LANE
WITHOUT
USING
EITHER
REARVIEWMIRROR
OR
FLASHERS
DOING
TO
AINT
A
RUSH
FOR
ME
BUT
ITS
FUN
AND
I
GET
WHERE
I
WANT
TO
GO
MUCH
FASTER
IN
DEFENSE
OF
THE
DRIVERS
WHO
ARE
IN
THE
RIGHT
LANE
HERE
IN
THE
STATES
PEOPLE
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
EXPECT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
DRIVING
TO
BE
OVERTAKEN
AT
A
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
OF
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
STUPID
OF
COURSE
THERE
ARE
EXCEPTIONS
THEY
ARE
JUST
PROGRAMMED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LIMIT
DO
YOU
IN
THE
STATES
WHEN
YOU
LOOK
IN
THE
REARVIEW
ALWAYS
CALCULATE
FUTURE
POSITIONS
OF
CARS
BASED
ON
A
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
LOVE
TO
DRIVE
IN
THE
LEFT
LANE
FAST
BUT
WHEN
I
OVERTAKE
CARS
WHO
ARE
ON
THE
RIGHT
I
SLOW
DOWN
A
TAD
BIT
IF
I
WERE
TO
RELY
ON
THE
JUDGEMENT
OF
THE
OTHER
CAR
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
I
WOULD
BE
THE
STUPID
ONE
JUST
TO
SATIATE
MY
CURIOSITY
WHY
WOULD
THIS
MAKE
YOU
THE
STUPID
ONE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
EVERYBODY
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
ENOUGH
OF
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
YOU
DO
NOT
NEED
TO
CALCULATE
THE
FUTURE
POSITION
YOU
NEED
TO
LOOK
AT
YOUR
MIRRORS
A
LITTLE
MORE
IF
YOU
GLANCE
AROUND
YOU
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
HOW
MUCH
FASTER
THAN
YOU
THE
CAR
IS
GOING
MAYBE
NOT
PRECISELY
BUT
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
KNOW
IF
YOU
SHOULD
LET
HIM
AROUND
BEFORE
YOU
TRY
TO
PASS
I
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
ABOUT
THE
OTHER
DRIVER
BEING
STARTLED
BECAUSE
I
MYSELF
HAVE
BEEN
STARTLED
BY
DRIVERS
CRUISING
BY
AT
AROUND
WHEN
IM
DOIN
THE
PROBLEM
THOUGH
AS
I
SAW
IT
WAS
NOT
THEIR
FAULT
FOR
BARRELING
AROUND
ME
BUT
MY
FAULT
FOR
NOT
PAYING
THE
ATTENTION
TO
MY
TASKATHAND
THAT
I
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ODDLY
ENOUGH
SINCE
THE
TIMEHAPPENED
IN
AROUND
MO
WHEN
ID
HAD
MY
LISCENCE
FOR
AROUND
MO
I
HAVENT
BEEN
STARTLEDAND
IVE
BEEN
PASSED
BY
CARS
DOING
ROUGHLY
TWICE
THE
SPEED
OF
MY
CAR
ANOTHER
ODD
OCCURANCE
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THIS
ONLY
SEEMS
TO
HAPPEN
ON
LONG
TRIPSAND
IF
I
DRIVE
ALONG
WITH
THEM
IT
DOESNT
HAPPEN
AT
ALL
EVEN
ON
THE
LONG
TRIPS
ADRENALINE
WILL
DO
THAT
TO
YOUIVE
HAD
BAD
COP
EXPERIENCES
WITH
SPEEDING
SO
ANYTHING
OVER
THE
LIMIT
IS
ADRENALIZING
FOR
MESCARED
ILL
GET
CAUGHT
MAYBE
THEY
SHOULD
RAISE
THE
LIMIT
SO
WE
CAN
PAY
BETTER
ATTENTION
JUST
CURIOUS
AND
MY
OTWO
DREW
