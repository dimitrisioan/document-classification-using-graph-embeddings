D
BARNARD
WRITES
WITH
SPRING
UPON
US
ITS
TIME
TO
START
WAXING
AGAIN
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
HAD
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
ABOUT
WAXES
AND
POLISHES
I
KNOW
CARNUBA
WAX
IS
OFTEN
RECOMMENDED
ON
THE
NET
BUT
I
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
THE
COLORED
WAXES
TO
COVER
UP
SOME
MINOR
SCRATCHES
DO
THE
COLORED
WAXES
GIVE
ON
OVERALL
GOOD
QUALITY
SHINE
ARE
THEY
GOOD
FOR
THE
PAINT
OR
CLEAR
COAT
WHAT
ABOUT
LIQUID
GLASS
IS
IT
A
CLEAR
POLISH
WHICH
DRIES
CLEAR
THUS
FILLING
SCRATCHES
IS
IT
GOOD
FOR
THE
PAINTCLEAR
COAT
PLEASE
POST
WITH
BOTH
GOOD
AND
BAD
EXPERIENCES
AND
HEY
LETS
NAME
NAMES
BRANDS
HERE
ALL
GIMMICKS
STICK
WITH
PLAIN
OL
CARNAUBA
WAX
THATS
NONABRASIVE
EAGLE
MEGUIARS
TURTLE
WAX
AND
A
FEW
OTHERS
ARE
GOOD
EXAMPLES
THE
COLORED
WAXES
JUST
COLOR
IN
THE
SCRATCHES
SO
THEYRE
NOT
SO
APPARENT
THE
BETTER
APPROACH
IS
TO
BUFF
MINOR
SCRATCHES
COMPLETELY
OFF
WITH
A
CLEANERMILD
ABRASIVE
NEVER
TRIED
LIQUID
GLASS
ALTHOUGH
I
STILL
HAVE
THIS
SAMPLE
THEY
SENT
ME
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
