this
happened
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of
ours
i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off
of
bridges
and
such
but
pound
rocks
has
our
society
really
stooped
this
low
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
at
