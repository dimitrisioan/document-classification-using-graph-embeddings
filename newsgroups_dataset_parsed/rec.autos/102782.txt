WOULD
BE
REALLY
COOL

WERE
SEVERAL
SERIOUS
INJURIES
AND
SADLY
A
SMALL
GIRL
SITTING
IN
THE
FRONT
SEAT
OF
ONE
OF
THEM
WAS
STRUCK
IN
THE
HEAD
BY
ONE
OF
THE
LARGER

I
DONT
RECALL
IF

A
MONTH

COMING
APART
AT

THE
BASIC
REASON
IS
THAT

WERE
KILLING
SOMEONE

NO
BIG
DEAL

ABORT
CHILDREN
ON
DEMAND
AND
KILL
THE

SURPRISED
WHEN

BECAUSE
THE
MESSAGE
THEY
HEAR
IS
