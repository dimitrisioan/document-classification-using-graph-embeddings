i
went
to
a
place
called
american
car
care
centers
to
check
my
car
for
ac
leak
after
checking
i
was
told
that
there
is
a
leak
in
the
compressor
seal
at
the
end
in
addition
to
the
labor
for
the
check
i
was
charged
dollars
for
a
pound
of
freon
although
they
evacuated
my
ac
afterwards
because
of
the
leak
first
is
it
fair
for
him
to
charge
me
for
a
pound
of
freon
plus
tax
second
what
can
i
do
about
this
if
this
is
unfair
albert

for
the
information
of
those
not
lucky
enough
to
live
in
the
city
of
austin
tx
if
an
auto
ac
system
is
checked
and
found
to
have
leaks
it
must
be
repaired
at
that
time
or
evacuated
this
is
an
ordinance
unique
i
think
to
the
city
of
austin
freon
is
subject
to
increasing
taxes
but
is
about
cost
here
recovered
freon
is
not
required
to
be
purchased
from
the
car
it
is
withdrawn
from
as
a
matter
of
practice
some
shops
here
are
charging
a
recycling
fee
that
is
less
than
the
cost
of
the
freon
removed
if
it
is
reintroduced
to
the
system
just
another
quality
service
from
an
enviornmentally
conscious
city
