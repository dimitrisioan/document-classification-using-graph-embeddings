well
i
guess
i
know
for
sure
what
i
meant
and
it
is
this
i
dont
know
where
you
drive
but
around
here
freeways
are
often
clogged
solid
with
large
packs
of
semis
trucks
and
cars
of
all
descriptions
when
i
close
on
one
of
these
rolling
clusterfs
on
the
highway
i
have
no
desire
to
add
my
vehicle
to
this
rolling
accident
looking
for
a
place
to
happen
if
there
were
any
way
to
pass
it
i
would
be
passing
myself
however
i
cant
as
i
posted
before
all
it
takes
is
a
blown
tire
or
some
moron
tramping
on
the
brakes
to
turn
this
pack
into
a
cloud
of
shredded
metal
flying
glass
and
burning
vehicles
i
want
to
maintain
enough
free
space
between
myself
and
this
mess
to
at
least
have
a
minimal
chance
to
avoid
a
mass
crash
that
means
maintaining
a
clear
space
between
me
and
it
however
there
is
no
end
of
shortdriving
morons
who
are
dying
to
pass
so
they
can
add
themselves
and
their
car
to
the
bodycount
that
wouldnt
bother
me
so
much
except
that
after
letting
enough
of
these
morons
pass
me
and
glue
themselves
to
the
pack
ahead
my
interval
is
filled
up
trying
to
back
off
further
does
not
work
because
the
road
behind
me
has
filled
up
trapping
my
car
right
into
an
ever
increasing
pack
now
if
there
was
any
slight
possibility
that
there
was
a
lane
open
ahead
id
be
glad
to
move
over
but
there
usually
is
no
way
in
hell
that
anybody
is
going
anywhere
so
i
block
the
wouldbe
passers
not
only
for
my
own
good
but
theirs
as
well
even
though
they
are
often
too
stupid
to
realize
it
just
an
comment
i
dont
like
it
when
people
decide
whats
good
for
me
if
you
think
youre
going
to
decide
anything
for
me
youd
better
be
carrying
a
badge
and
a
gun
who
made
you
capable
of
determining
if
there
is
no
way
in
hell
that
anybody
is
going
anywhere
why
do
you
find
it
necessary
to
add
to
the
problem
instead
of
just
minding
your
own
business
if
someone
is
minding
their
own
business
i
will
give
them
all
the
room
they
want
and
ill
try
to
make
things
easy
for
them
even
letting
them
in
in
front
of
me
if
they
ask
politely
with
a
directional
on
the
other
hand
if
someone
like
you
decides
they
want
to
block
me
and
be
a
general
asshole
you
can
bet
your
ass
that
ill
make
life
as
miserable
as
possible
for
you
as
long
as
it
doesnt
affect
anyone
else
whos
minding
their
own
business
they
have
a
phrase
to
describe
someone
like
you
self
appointed
traffic
police
just
mind
your
own
business
and
stay
in
the
right
lane
where
you
belong
as
a
rule
of
philosophy
i
dont
feel
particularly
sorry
when
somebody
gets
offed
by
his
own
stupidity
but
it
does
worry
me
when
some
idiot
is
in
a
position
to
cash
in
my
chips
too
