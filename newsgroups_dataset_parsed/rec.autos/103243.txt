WRITES
FYI
JUST
LAST
WEEK
THE
PBS
SHOW
MOTOR
WEEK
GAVE
THE
RESULTS
OF
WHAT
THEY
THOUGHT
WERE
THE
BEST
CARS
FOR
IN
THE
CONVERTIBLE
CATEGORY
THE
SNIP
SNIP
DOES
PORSCHE
HAVE
A
PATENT
ON
THE
TARGA
NAME
I
MEAN
CONVERTIBLE
TO
ME
MEANS
TOP
DOWN
WHICH
THE
DEL
SOL
CERTAINLY
DOES
NOT
DO
IT
HAS
THE
CENTER
THAT
LIFTS
OUT
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
WOULD
TERM
A
TARGAUNLESS
PORSCHES
WAS
GONNA
SUE
ME
FOR
DOING
THAT
I
KNOW
THE
REAR
WINDOW
ROLLS
DOWN
BUT
I
STILL
CAN
HARDLY
CONSIDER
THIS
CAR
TO
BE
A
CONVERTIBLE
DREW
HERE
WE
GO
NO
OF
COURSE
PORSCHE
DOESNT
HAVE
A
PATENT
ON
THE
TARGA
NAME
IF
THAT
WERE
THE
CASE
WHAT
WOULD
FIAT
DO
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
TECHNICALLY
MY
DEL
SOL
IS
NOT
A
CONVERTIBLE
IN
THE
LITERAL
SENSE
BUT
IT
CERTAINLY
CLASSIFIES
AS
AN
OPEN
TOPPED
CAR
IN
ADDITION
THE
REAR
SECTION
BEHIND
THE
REMOVABLE
TOP
IS
WHAT
MAKES
MY
CAR
INFINATELY
SAFER
THAN
A
CONVERTIBLE
