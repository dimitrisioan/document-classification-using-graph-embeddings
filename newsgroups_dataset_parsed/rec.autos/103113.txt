RE
HONDA
ACCORD
BRAKE
PROBLEM
JONI
CIARLETTA
WRITES
MY
HONDA
ACCORD
JUST
HIT
THE
MAGIC
MILE
MARK
AND
NOW
ALL
SORTS
OF
THINGS
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
GO
BAD
THE
LATEST
PROBLEM
I
AM
EXPERIENCING
IS
WITH
MY
BRAKES
THEY
STILL
STOP
THE
CAR
FINE
BUT
ONCE
I
AM
STOPPED
COMPLETELY
MY
BRAKE
PEDAL
WILL
SINK
ANOTHER
OR
INCHES
ALL
BY
ITSELF
IF
FEELS
REALLY
STRANGE
AND
I
AM
WORRIED
MY
BRAKES
WILL
QUIT
WORKING
ONE
OF
THESE
DAYS
I
CHECKED
MY
BRAKE
FLUID
AND
THE
RESERVOIR
WAS
FULL
BUT
THE
FLUID
ITSELF
LOOKED
REALLY
DIRTY
LIKE
DIRTY
OIL
I
CALLED
MY
MECHANIC
AND
HE
TOLD
ME
I
NEED
A
NEW
BRAKE
MASTER
CYLINDER
WHICH
WILL
COST
ME
A
WHOPPING
YOU
ARE
NOT
ALONE
MY
HONDA
ACCORD
WITH
MILES
ON
IT
STARTED
SHOWING
THE
SAME
BEHAVIOR
I
REPLACED
THE
BRAKE
MASTER
CYLINDER
MYSELF
IT
TOOK
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
AND
COST
ABOUT
SURE
BEATS
PAYING
TO
HAVE
SOMEONE
ELSE
DO
IT
IF
I
WANTED
TO
REBUILD
MY
OWN
MASTER
CYLINDER
INSTEAD
OF
PUTTING
IN
A
REBUILT
ONE
IT
WOULD
HAVE
COST
ONLY
TO
FOR
THE
REBUILD
KIT
THE
HONDA
BRAKE
MASTER
CYLINDER
IS
EASY
TO
GET
TO
TWO
BOLTS
ATTACH
IT
TO
THE
ENGINE
COMPARTMENT
TWO
BRAKE
LINES
ENTER
THE
MASTER
CYLINDER
THE
TRICKY
PART
WAS
THAT
THE
BRAKE
LINES
WERE
STUCK
TIGHT
MY
CRAFTSMEN
OPEN
END
WRENCH
ROUNDED
OFF
THE
BOLT
HEADS
I
HAD
TO
USE
VISE
GRIPS
TO
LOOSEN
THOSE
SUCKERS
WOW
BEST
INVENTION
SINCE
SLICED
BREAD
AFTER
THAT
IT
WAS
VERY
EASY
BOLT
THE
NEW
PART
IN
PLACE
ADD
NEW
BRAKE
FLUID
AND
BLEED
THE
BRAKES
THIS
IS
QUITE
EASY
EVEN
FOR
A
BEGINNER
MY
LOCAL
AUTO
PARTS
STORE
HAD
A
REPAIR
MANUAL
FOR
THE
HONDA
ACCORD
IT
HAD
DETAILED
DIAGRAMS
OF
THE
MASTER
BRAKE
CYLINDER
AND
A
STEPBYSTEP
PROCEDURE
FOR
REPLACING
IT
