re
the
mustang
the
current
will
soldier
on
for
about
two
years
a
version
of
the
valve
modular
in
the
mark
viii
could
be
offered
then
how
unfortunate
for
anyone
who
loves
the
simplicity
with
which
and
fords
and
and
chevys
can
be
built
up
still
it
will
provide
a
needed
punch
for
the
ford
to
stay
up
with
the
new
firebirdcamaros
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
if
ford
called
the
engine
a
litre
in
the
mustang
we
all
know
that
the
current
is
really
litres
anyway
undisguised
the
car
looks
ok
but
not
nearly
as
exciting
as
the
new
camarofirebird
imo
i
must
agree
i
dont
think
ive
seen
anything
as
impressive
looking
as
the
new
firebird
since
my
friend
back
home
sold
his
formula
firebird
for
a
paltry
without
even
telling
me
the
bastard
