RE
BRAINDEAD
DRIVERS
WHO
DONT
LOOK
AHEAD
HHMCBNEWSDCBATTCOM
HERSCHELHMAYO
WRITES
SO
I
BLOCK
THE
WOULDBE
PASSERS
NOT
ONLY
FOR
MY
OWN
GOOD
BUT
THEIRS
AS
WELL
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
OFTEN
TOO
STUPID
TO
REALIZE
IT
AS
A
RULE
OF
PHILOSOPHY
I
DONT
FEEL
PARTICULARLY
SORRY
WHEN
SOMEBODY
GETS
OFFED
BY
HIS
OWN
STUPIDITY
BUT
IT
DOES
WORRY
ME
WHEN
SOME
IDIOT
IS
IN
A
POSITION
TO
CASH
IN
MY
CHIPS
TOO
HH
MAYO
DONNA
MARTZ
WRITES
WELL
ARENT
WE
JUST
MR
ALTRUISM
HIMSELF
JUST
WHAT
THE
WORLD
NEEDS
ANOTHER
FRUSTRATED
SELF
APPOINTED
TRAFFIC
COP
HHMCBNEWSDCBATTCOM
HERSCHELHMAYO
WRITES
WELL
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
STICK
THE
NOSE
OF
YOUR
CAR
UP
THE
ASS
OF
A
FOOT
SEMI
I
SUPPOSE
ITS
YOUR
NECK
HOWEVER
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
LET
YOU
KILL
ME
IN
THE
BARGAIN
IF
YOU
GET
FRUSTRATED
BY
SOMEBODY
DELAYING
YOUR
INEVITABLE
DEATH
DUE
TO
LESS
THAT
WISE
DRIVING
PRACTICES
THEN
TOUGH
WELL
I
NEVER
WROTE
THAT
I
WOULD
ACT
AS
YOU
DESCRIBED
I
STATED
THAT
I
WOULD
NOT
BLOCK
A
WOULDBE
PASSER
I
WOULD
NOT
BLOCK
A
WOULDBE
PASSER
FOR
THEIR
OWN
GOOD
OR
FOR
ANY
REASON
OTHER
THAN
I
WAS
PREVENTED
FROM
DOING
SO
DUE
TO
THE
TRAFFIC
CIRCUMSTANCE
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
HOW
DETERRING
A
PASSER
UNDER
THESE
CIRCUMSTANCE
WOULD
IN
ANY
WAY
DECREASE
YOUR
CHANCES
OF
BEING
INVOLVED
IN
AN
ACCIDENT
FATAL
OR
OTHERWISE
IN
FACT
I
COULD
IMAGINE
HOW
BLOCKING
A
WOULDBE
PASSER
WOULD
ACTUALLY
INCREASE
YOUR
CHANCES
OF
BEING
OFFED
OR
INVOLVED
IN
AN
ACCIDENT
ESPECIALLY
IF
THIS
PASSER
IS
RIDING
YOUR
BUMPER
INTENTIONALLY
BLOCKING
A
PERSON
RIDING
YOUR
BUMPER
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
A
WISE
DRIVING
PRACTICE
IT
ONLY
CAUSES
THE
JAM
TO
BECOME
MORE
CONGESTED
I
DONT
MESS
WITH
TRUCKS
AND
I
ACTUALLY
WATCH
THE
ROAD
AHEAD
AND
THE
ROAD
BEHIND
IF
I
PERCEIVE
THAT
I
AM
RAPIDLY
CLOSING
ON
A
PACK
OF
VEHICLES
I
TRY
TO
AVOID
GETTING
CAUGHT
UP
IN
SITUATION
SUCH
AS
YOU
DECRIBE
USUALLY
EITHER
TRAFFIC
IS
JUST
BUILDING
AND
I
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
FACT
OF
LIFE
OR
I
WAIT
TO
A
SLOW
PASSER
TO
COMPLETE
THEIR
PASS
AND
MAKE
WAY
FOR
THE
PACK
TO
CLEAR
IF
SOMEONE
DECIDES
THEN
TO
PULL
UP
ON
MY
BUMPER
I
SIGNAL
MY
INTENTION
TO
MOVE
TO
THE
RIGHT
AND
DO
SO
AT
THE
FIRST
OPPORTUNITY
HOPE
THEY
WILL
OPEN
THE
JAM
I
FEEL
THIS
IS
NOT
ONLY
COURTEOUS
DRIVING
BUT
ALOT
SAFER
THAN
THE
ACTIONS
YOU
ADVOCATE
THERE
ARE
ACTUALLY
MANY
COURTEOUS
DRIVERS
ON
THE
ROAD
WHO
DO
NOT
INTENTIONALLY
IMPEDE
OTHERS
IF
SOMEONE
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
SEEMS
TO
BE
OBLIVIOUS
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
ARE
BLOCKING
TRAFFIC
I
USE
MY
BLINKER
OR
FLASH
MY
LIGHTS
OR
IF
ALL
ELSE
FAILS
WILL
BRIEFLY
SPEED
UP
SLOW
DOWN
SO
THEY
MIGHT
GET
THE
MESSAGE
THAT
I
AM
A
FASTER
VEHICLE
TRYING
TO
PASS
I
FEEL
IT
IS
NEVER
SAFE
TO
RIDE
ANYONES
BUMPER
IF
SOMEONE
IS
INTENTIONALLY
BLOCKING
TRAFFIC
BECAUSE
THEY
FEEL
THAT
IT
IS
CIVIL
DUTY
OR
PHILOSOPHIC
DUTY
OR
FOR
SOME
UNFATHOMABLE
REASON
I
FEEL
THEY
DESERVE
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
DERISION
SORRY
THIS
IS
SOOOOOOOO
LONG
