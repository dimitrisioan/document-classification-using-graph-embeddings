IN

WRITES
WHILE
TAKING
AN
EXTENDED
EASTER
VACATION
I
WAS
GOING
NORTH
ON
SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN
CENTERVILLE
TX
AND
DALLAS
TX
AND
I
CAME
UPON
A
TRAIN
PARKED
ON
A
TRESTLE
WITH
ITS
LOCOMOTIVE
SITTING
DIRECTLY
OVER
THE
NORTHBOUND
LANES
THERE
APPEARED
TO
BE
MOVEMENT
WITHIN
THE
CAB
AND
OUT
OF
CURIOSITY
I
SLOWED
TO
TO
GET
A
BETTER
LOOK
JUST
AS
I
PASSED
FROM
UNDERNEATH
THE
TRESTLE
MY
RADAR
DETECTOR
WENT
INTO
FULL
ALERT
ALL
LIGHTS
LIT
AND
ALL
CHIRPS
BEEPS
AND
BUZZES
GOING
STRONG
I
THOUGHT
I
HAD
BEEN
NAILED
GOOD
BUT
NO
POLICE
MATERIALIZED
COULD
THIS
HAVE
BEEN
CAUSED
BY
THE
TRAINS
RADIO
OR
WHAT
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
TRAINS
BUT
IVE
SAW
A
SIGN
ON
THE
BACK
OF
A
GREYHOUND
BUS
THAT
WARNS
YOU
THAT
YOUR
RADAR
DETECTOR
MAY
BE
SET
OFF
IT
DOESNT
EXPLAIN
WHY
BUT
IT
DOES
SET
OFF
MY
RADAR
DETECTOR
FROM
THE
