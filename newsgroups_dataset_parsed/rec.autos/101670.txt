id
like
to
get
some
feedback
on
a
car
with
most
bang
for
the
buck
in
the
to
price
range
im
looking
for
a
car
with
enough
civility
to
be
driven
every
day
or
even
on
long
trips
but
when
i
hit
the
gas
i
want
to
feel
some
acceleration
handling
is
important
also
as
are
reliability
and
pretty
low
maintenance
costs
a
stylish
appearance
is
nice
but
i
dont
want
a
car
that
is
all
show
and
not
much
go
even
though
many
of
the
imports
are
fast
i
dont
really
want
a
turbo
and
i
never
have
cared
for
the
song
sung
by
a
four
clyinder
id
prefer
a
or
for
the
engine
if
you
have
any
suggestions
kevin

long
trips
reliability
and
low
maintenance
cost
