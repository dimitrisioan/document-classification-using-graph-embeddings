WRITES
ID
LIKE
TO
GET
SOME
FEEDBACK
ON
A
CAR
WITH
MOST
BANG
FOR
THE
BUCK
IN
THE
TO
PRICE
RANGE
IM
LOOKING
FOR
A
CAR
WITH
ENOUGH
CIVILITY
TO
BE
DRIVEN
EVERY
DAY
OR
EVEN
ON
LONG
TRIPS
BUT
WHEN
I
HIT
THE
GAS
I
WANT
TO
FEEL
SOME
ACCELERATION
HANDLING
IS
IMPORTANT
ALSO
AS
ARE
RELIABILITY
AND
PRETTY
LOW
MAINTENANCE
COSTS
A
STYLISH
APPEARANCE
IS
NICE
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
A
CAR
THAT
IS
ALL
SHOW
AND
NOT
MUCH
GO
EVEN
THOUGH
MANY
OF
THE
IMPORTS
ARE
FAST
I
DONT
REALLY
WANT
A
TURBO
AND
I
NEVER
HAVE
CARED
FOR
THE
SONG
SUNG
BY
A
FOUR
CLYINDER
ID
PREFER
A
OR
FOR
THE
ENGINE
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
KEVIN
PARKER
THERES
ONLY
ONE
CAR
THAT
REALLY
FITS
YOUR
NEEDS
ITS
SPELLED
LITER
MUSTANG
NOT
SORRY
HE
SAID
CVILITY
LONG
TRIPS
RELIABILITY
AND
LOW
MAINTENANCE
COST
