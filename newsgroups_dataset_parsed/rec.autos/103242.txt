WRITES
HELLO
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
TO
TAKE
OUT
THE
BOLT
UNDER
THE
ENGINE
COMPARTMENT
SHOULD
I
TURN
CLOCKWISE
OR
COUNTER
I
TRIED
ANY
KIND
OF
LUBRICANTS
BUT
I
STILL
FAILED
DO
YOU
THINK
I
CAN
USE
A
ELECTRIC
DRILL
CHANGE
TO
A
SUITABLE
BIT
TO
TURN
IT
OUT
IF
I
CAN
SUCCEED
CAN
I
RETIGHTEN
IT
NOT
TOO
TIGHT
IS
IT
SAFE
WITHOUT
OIL
LEAK
YOU
SHOULDNT
NEED
ANY
POWER
TOOLS
TO
UNDO
IT
AN
ELECTRIC
DRILL
PROBABLY
WONT
GIVE
YOU
MUCH
EXTRA
TORQUE
ANYWAY
WILL
HELP
THINGS
THAT
ARE
SEIZED
DUE
TO
RUST
BUT
THIS
IS
UNLIKELY
FOR
A
DRAIN
PLUG
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
UNDO
IT
WITH
A
SPANNER
WHEN
IT
LOOSENS
IT
WILL
PROBABLY
BECOME
VERY
LOOSE
AND
YOU
WILL
BASH
YOUR
KNUCKLES
ON
THE
UNDERSIDE
OF
THE
CAR
THIS
IS
THE
PRICE
YOU
MUST
PAY
FOR
DOING
YOU
OWN
WORK
NO
THATS
THE
PRICE
YOU
PAY
FOR
NOT
KNOWING
HOW
TO
USE
A
WRENCH
YOU
WANT
TO
PULL
THE
WRENCH
TOWARDS
YOU
AWAY
FROM
PAINFUL
KNUCKLE
SPLITTING
HARD
THINGS
IF
YOU
CANT
PULL
IT
BECAUSE
THINGS
ARE
IN
THE
WAY
PUSH
IT
WITH
AN
OPEN
HAND
I
FIND
THIS
METHOD
MUCH
BETTER
MYSELF
TOO
ALTHOUGH
I
DO
REALLY
HATE
IT
WHEN
THE
BOLT
FINALLY
COMES
LOOSE
AND
THE
WRENCH
AND
MY
HAND
BOTH
COME
CRASHING
INTO
MY
FACE
AFTER
COMING
TO
WHICH
IS
ABOUT
MINUTES
LATER
I
CHANGE
MY
CLOTHES
BECAUSE
BY
THIS
TIME
ALL
THE
OIL
HAS
DRAINED
ON
ME
AND
ICE
MY
ENTIRE
FACE
AND
SUCK
DOWN
ABOUT
TYLENOL
TO
EASE
THE
PAIN
LATER
IN
THE
DAY
I
THEN
PROCEED
WITH
REFILLING
THE
ENGINE
OIL
ITS
JUST
CRAZY
HOW
I
TRY
AND
CHANGE
THE
OIL
ON
MY
CARS
IN
ONE
WEEKENDI
GO
THROUGH
ABOUT
BOTTLES
OF
TYLENOL
AND
BAGS
OF
ICE
