let
me
explain
why
i
feel
the
bogey
counter
feature
is
a
gimmick
radar
waves
bounce
off
objects
especially
metal
that
is
how
radar
speed
measurement
works
a
high
frequency
microwave
x
band
approx
ghz
and
k
is
approx
ghz
is
sent
out
and
reflected
back
to
the
antenna
off
of
an
automobile
or
other
objects
if
an
object
is
moving
a
doppler
shift
about
hz
per
mph
on
x
band
occurs
is
measured
and
converted
to
miles
per
hour
these
waves
bounce
all
over
the
place
and
they
can
reflect
many
times
and
go
in
many
directions
from
what
i
understand
the
can
only
tell
if
these
microwaves
are
coming
from
the
front
rear
or
both
there
are
only
two
antennas
if
they
are
coming
from
both
this
in
interpreted
as
a
side
bogey
bogey
counts
are
determined
as
sources
by
their
relative
strength
to
one
another
even
if
they
are
reflections
of
the
same
source
im
certainly
no
engineer
and
really
have
no
scientific
basis
on
which
to
make
this
argument
but
dont
you
answer
your
own
question
is
the
reflected
signal
shifted
at
all
from
the
act
of
being
reflected
if
so
wouldnt
it
then
be
easy
for
the
detector
to
discriminate
between
reflections
and
direct
sources
here
is
the
problem
since
the
microwaves
reflect
how
does
the
unit
tell
if
it
is
a
source
or
a
reflection
take
a
and
drive
to
the
local
grocery
store
that
uses
an
xband
radar
door
opener
you
can
tell
by
the
small
black
box
above
the
door
pointed
down
at
about
a
degree
angle
and
your
detector
going
off
when
it
gets
near
the
will
count
or
bogeys
from
all
directions
front
rear
and
sides
it
doesnt
say
which
side
the
count
changes
as
cars
drive
by
and
reflections
change
is
there
or
sources
not
at
the
store
i
go
to
as
i
drive
around
with
a
standard
detector
i
can
only
find
one
source
and
that
is
the
door
opener
for
the
front
door
