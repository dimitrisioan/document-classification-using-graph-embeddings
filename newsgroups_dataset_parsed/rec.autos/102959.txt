FAST
IDLE
ON
FORD
RANGER
IT
DID
IT
AGAIN
THIS
MORNING
MY
FORD
RANGER
WAS
IDLING
AT
RPM
OK
SO
I
EXAGGERATED
A
LITTLE
BUT
IT
WAS
IDLING
VERY
FAST
IT
HAS
A
LITER
CARBURATED
ENGINE
IN
IT
AND
NO
BLIPPING
OF
THE
THROTTLE
WOULD
CAUSE
THE
IDLE
TO
DROP
BACK
TO
NORMAL
I
DONT
THINK
THE
LINKAGE
IS
STUCK
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
TO
FIX
THIS
PROBLEM
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
PROBLEM
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
BUT
HAS
STRAIGHTENED
ITSELF
OUT
UNTIL
NOW
I
DONT
HAVE
A
TACH
BUT
BY
GAUGING
BY
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
ENGINE
IT
IS
IDLING
ABOUT
TWICE
AS
FAST
AS
IT
SHOULD
BE
THIS
IS
DOWN
FROM
WHAT
IT
WAS
IDLING
AT
WHEN
I
PULLED
UP
AT
A
STOP
LIGHT

THANKS
FOR
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
