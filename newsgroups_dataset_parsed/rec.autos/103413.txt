I
HAVE
A
BUICK
SKYLARK
WITH
ON
IT
I
BOUGHT
IT
IN
CALIFORNIA
AND
IF
ITLL
LET
ME
ID
LIKE
TO
KEEP
IT
FOR
ANOTHER
YEAR
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS
THESE
INDIANA
WINTERSMY
HEATER
CONTROLS
DONT
WORK
THE
CAR
HAS
VACUUM
OPERATED
CONTROL
SWITCHES
FOR
THE
VENTS
RIGHT
NOW
IT
IS
STUCK
IN
THE
VENT
MODE
IT
WILL
BLOW
WARM
AIR
BUT
I
CANT
SWITCH
THE
AIR
FLOW
TO
EITHER
THE
FLOOR
I
CAN
LIVE
WITHOUT
THIS
OR
THE
DEFROST
I
CANT
LIVE
WITHOUT
THIS
I
PROBABLY
COULD
JUST
JAM
THE
AIR
DEFLECTOR
TO
THE
DEFROST
POSITION
BUT
THIS
BLOWS
A
LOT
OF
AIR
IN
MY
FACE
AND
IS
WELL
KIND
OF
LIKE
PUTTING
A
VACUUM
CLEANER
IN
REVERSE
I
HAVE
TAKEN
PARTS
OF
THE
DASH
OFF
AND
LOOKED
AT
THE
VACUUM
SYSTEM
AND
I
THINK
THE
PROBLEM
OR
PART
OF
IT
IS
WITH
THE
TWO
DIAPHRAGMS
WHICH
CONTROL
UPDOWN
AND
OUTSIDEINSIDE
AIR
FLOW
THE
DIAPHRAGM
WHICH
CONTROLS
OUTSIDEVENTIN
SIDENO
VENT
AIR
IS
CRACKED
MOST
OF
THE
WAY
AROUND
AND
THE
OTHER
ONE
IS
PROBABLY
DAMAGED
TOO
CONSIDERING
THE
ADVANCED
AGE
OF
THE
CAR
TWO
QUESTIONS
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
I
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
OF
ABOUT
THIS
OTHER
THAN
THE
FACT
THAT
I
SHOULD
MOVE
FROM
INDIANA
IN
THE
EVENT
THAT
REPLACEMENT
DIAPHRAGMS
ARENT
AVAILABLE
IS
THERE
A
WAY
TO
FIX
THIS
