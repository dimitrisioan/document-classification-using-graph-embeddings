as
a
matter
of
interest
does
anyone
know
why
autos
are
so
popular
in
the
us
while
here
in
europe
they
are
rare
just
wondering
primarily
milage
gas
is
much
more
expensive
so
people
are
very
concerned
about
it
taking
a
few
more
liters
per
kilometer
this
along
with
narrow
old
cities
also
results
in
smaller
cars
with
smaller
engines
these
engines
usually
dont
have
the
torque
to
mesh
well
with
an
automatic
so
having
engines
that
dont
work
well
with
autos
and
a
great
concern
for
milage
the
usual
eurocar
has
a
manual
note
that
not
many
big
benzes
come
with
manuals
if
youve
got
the
money
for
the
car
youve
got
the
money
for
the
gas
and
the
engine
to
drive
through
the
slushbox
as
automatics
become
more
efficient
the
bigotry
is
probably
reduced
still
everyone
knows
how
to
drive
a
manual
and
cars
are
cheaper
with
one
and
it
saves
a
little
expensive
fuel
so
there
arent
compelling
reasons
to
go
automatic
