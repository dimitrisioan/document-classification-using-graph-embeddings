HOWEVER
IF
I
WERE
TO
DESIGN
A
BMWS
ELECTRONICS
I
WILL
USE
A
COUNTER
TO
COUNT
THE
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
THE
CAR
PASSED
MILLION
MILES
OR
WHATEVER
AND
STORE
IT
IN
THE
CAR
COMPUTERS
MEMORY
THIS
COULD
BE
READ
WHEN
DOING
A
DIAGNOSTICS
TEST
DITTO
FOR
THE
DATE
OF
THE
ODOMETER
AS
EASY
AS
THIS
IS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
MANAFUCTURERS
DONT
DO
IT
DONT
THEY
TO
PREVENT
ILLEGAL
ODOMETER
TAMPERING
BUT
AS
A
PREVIOUS
WRITER
SAID
IT
WILL
IN
ANY
CASE
TAKE
AEONS
TO
RESET
AN
ODOMETER
MECHANIC
OR
ELECTRONIC
BY
SIMULATING
A
DRIVING
CAR
IT
WILL
BE
EASIER
TO
REPROGRAM
IT
HOW
I
DONT
KNOW
IT
SHOULDNT
BE
THAT
HARD
IF
YOU
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
DIGITAL
ELECTRONICS
IF
THE
COUNTER
IS
MADE
WITH
STANDARD
TTL
CHIPS
ALL
YOU
SHOULD
NEED
TO
DO
IS
FIND
THE
CHIPS
USED
FOR
COUNTING
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
MILEAGE
YOU
WANT
TO
PUT
IN
AND
PRESET
IT
BUT
WIRING
THE
PRESET
PINS
DIRECTLY
TO
LOWHIGH
YOUD
ALSO
HAVE
TO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
CONVENTIONS
ARE
FOR
LOW
AND
HIGH
IT
MIGHT
BE
A
LITTLE
MORE
INVOLVED
THAN
THIS
BUT
IT
SHOULDNT
BE
BEYOND
SOMEONE
WITH
A
BSEE
OR
BS
EET
ALL
THE
DISPLAY
DOES
IS
CONVERT
WHAT
THE
COUNTER
CHIPS
SAY
INTO
DIGITS
USING
A
TRANSLATION
TABLE
STORED
IN
ROM
SELAH
DAN
BUT
THOSE
CHIPS
ARE
PROBABLY
INSIDE
A
CUSTOM
CHIP
TO
MAKE
IT
SMALLER
AND
USE
LESS
POWER
AND
THE
PRESETDATA
PINS
ARE
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
AVAILABLE
IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
NOT
BE
TTL
BUT
MIGHT
BE
CMOS
WIDER
OPERATING
VOLTAGE
RANGE
NOT
THAT
THE
TECNOLOGY
WOULD
MAKE
MUCH
DIFFERENCE
PLUS
THE
CUSTOM
CHIP
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
POTTED
ENCAPSULATED
WITH
EPOXY
GOOD
LUCK
GARYL
ANY
SHARK
THAT
GETS
