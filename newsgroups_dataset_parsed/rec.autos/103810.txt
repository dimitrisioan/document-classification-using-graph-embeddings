re
the
mustang
and
bythe
way
and
camaro
both
have
drums
on
the
rear
breaks
hello
this
is
the
s
vlasis
theodore
good
point
you
would
think
by
now
that
most
car
companies
would
just
make
wheel
disc
standard
and
be
done
with
it
can
it
really
cost
that
much
more
for
disc
especially
when
you
think
of
the
economies
of
scale
they
would
gain
by
just
making
them
all
wheel
disc
no
seperate
parts
numbers
and
orders
etc
btw
the
and
trans
am
and
formula
have
disc
but
the
bottom
line
models
have
the
rear
drums
