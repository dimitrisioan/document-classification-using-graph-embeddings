ANYONE

OF

ALA
HOW

DO
IN

LONG

REPAIR

RELIABILITY

ETC
I
AM
FIXING
TO
BUY
A
CAR
IN
THE
NEXT
FEW
MONTHS
AIMING
TOWARD
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
BIGGER
THAN
A
TYPICAL
SMALL
CAR
AND
WITH
A
LITTLE
MORE
POWER
I
AM
CONSIDERING
THE
PROBE
ACCORD
COROLLA
AND
THE
I
BOUGHT
A
PROBE
GT
WITH
THE
PEP
LAST
JULY
NOW
AT
MILES
AFTER
DEBATING
OVER
THE
SENTRA
STEALTH
PRELUDE
AND
CELICA
THE
CAR
DESIGN
IS
DIFFERENT
THAN
EARLIER
YEARS
SO
ITS
TOO
EARLY
TO
SEE
ITS
RELIABILITY
SO
FAR
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
MY
COMMENTS
MY
DISLIKES

SOME
OTHER

MAILING
LIST
HAVE
COMMENTED
ABOUT
THIS
PROBLEM
BUT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IT
HAPPEN
ON
MY
MONTH
OLD
PROBE
GT
I
THINK
THIS
MAY
BE
SOMETHING
THAT
FORD
HAS
CORRECTED
SINCE
THE
INITIAL
BATCH
OF
CARS
ALSO
SOMEONE
SAID
THAT
FORD
HAS
ISSUED
A
SERVICE
BULLETIN
TO
INFORM
DEALERS
ABOUT
HOW
TO
CORRECT
THIS
PROBLEM
SO
YOU
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
YOUR
DEALER
TO
FIX
IT

ITS
PRETTY
MUCH
TAKES
UP
ALL
THE

WHERE
YOUD
EXPECT
TO
FIND
THE
HORN
SPEAKING
OF
THE
HORN
I
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
THAT
THE
PROBE
COMES
WITH
ONE
OF
THOSE
NICE
MERICAN
SOUNDING
HORNS
INSTEAD
OF
THE

LEFT
HOPING
FOR
I
AGREE
STRONGLY
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
ABOVE
ESPECIALLY
ABOUT
THE
ENGINE
THE
INTERIOR
IS
VERY
VERY
NICE
TOO
VERY
PLEASING
TO
THE
EYE
AND
ERGONOMICALLY
SOUND
I
DRIVE
IT
TO
AND
FROM
WORK
EACH
DAY
ON
RELATIVELY
SMOOTH
ROADS
AND
MOST
NOTICABLE
THING
IS
THAT
THE
PROBES
SUSPENSION
DOESNT
LIKE
POTHOLES
WHEN
YOU
TEST
DRIVE
ONE
FIND
A
POTHOLED
ROAD
SOMEWHERE
AROUND
TOWN
AND
SEE
IF
THE
JARRING
YOU
GET
IS
TOLERABLE
YES
THIS
CARS
STIFF
SUSPENSION
ISNT
FOR
EVERYONE
I
PERSONALLY
LIKE
IT
BUT
IF
YOU
FIND
IT
A
LITTLE
HARSH
BUT
OTHERWISE
LIKE
THE
CAR
ID
STRONGLY
SUGGEST
LOOKING
INTO
THE
IF
YOU
HAVE
PASSENGERS
BY
ALL
MEANS
BRING
THEM
ALONG
TOO
THEYLL
FIND
THAT
THEY
HAVE
NO
ROOM
IN
THE
BACK
AND
YOULL
FIND
THAT
THE
CAR
RIDES
DIFFERENTLY
IF
THATS
BETTER
IS
UP
TO
YOU
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
BACK
SEAT
IS
THAT
THERES
NO
LEG
ROOM
PLENTY
OF
HEAD
ROOM
THOUGH
SHORTER
PEOPLE
FIT
BACK
THERE
WITHOUT
ANY
COMPLAINTS
SO
LONG
AS
THE
SEAT
THEY
ARE
SITTING
BEHIND
IS
PULLED
FORWARD
A
BIT
TO
GIVE
THEM
A
PLACE
TO
PUT
THEIR
FEET
ALSO
THERES
A
LOT
OF
GLASS
AROUND
YOU
WHICH
I
WASNT
EXPECTING
THE
TEMPERATURE
INSIDE
THE
CAR
GETS
PRETTY
HOT
IN
THE
SUMMER
MY
BACK
SEAT
PASSENGERS
NOW
VERY
FEW
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THE
LACK
OF
VENTILATION
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
CONSIDER
THAT
WHEN
COMBINED
WITH
THE
HEAT
THE
POWER
MOONROOF
CAN
GREATLY
IMPROVE
THE
VENTILATION
THROUGHOUT
THE
CAR
I
REALLY
ENJOY
THE
MOONROOF
BY
THE
WAY
BUT
THEN
IVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
A
SUCKER
FOR
OPEN
AIR
DRIVING
NO
LEAKAGE
PROBLEMS
OR
ANYTHING
LIKE
THATYET
IVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
EXHAUST
SYSTEM
HAS
TROUBLE
BUT
MINE
WORKS
FINE
I
HAVENT
HEARD
ABOUT
THIS
ONE
I
KNOW
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
VERY
EARLY
PROBES
AND
MAYBE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
PREMATURELY
RUSTING
MUFFLERS
WHICH
FORD
WILL
REPLACE
AT
NO
CHARGE
BUT
I
HAVENT
HEARD
ABOUT
ANYTHING
LIKE
THIS
CONCERNING
THE
PROBES
I
HAVENT
HAD
ANY
REAL
TROUBLE
WITH
THIS
CAR
OUTSIDE
OF
A
CV
JOINT
BOOT
THAT
WAS
LEAKING
BUT
THE
DEALER
TOOK
CARE
OF
THAT
PROMPTLY
AND
EVEN
GAVE
ME
A
FREE
RENTAL
CAR
FOR
THE
DAY
AND
A
HALF
THAT
I
WAS
WITHOUT
MY
CAR
I
WAS
QUITE
HAPPY
WITH
THE
WAY
THEY
HANDLEDESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING
THAT
I
WAS
EXPECTING
THE
WORST
FROM
THEM
FROM
WHAT
IVE
HEARD
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
FORDMAZDA
HAD
SOME
QC
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
PROBE
AND
PROBABLY
WHEN
THEY
FIRST
WENT
INTO
PRODUCTION
BUT
I
THINK
THESE
PROBLEMS
HAVE
MOSTLY
BEEN
CORRECTED
AT
THIS
POINT
THATS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
TO
BE
EXPECTED
WITH
A
COMPLETELY
NEW
CAR

THIS
