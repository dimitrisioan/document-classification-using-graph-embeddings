esp
the

the
digital
dash
of
the
cougars
with
the
large
analog
clock
in
the
middle
of
the
dash
everything
was
digital
except
the
stinking
clock
the
funny
thing
about
the
digital
dash
tbird
with
the
speedo
limit
was
that
if
you
pressed
the
button
to
convert
to
kilometers
it
would
read
all
the
way
up
to
at
this
point
the
stock
anemic
would
get
short
of
breath
this
of
course
was
equivalent
to
about

bet
i
really
coulda
confused
this
thing
if
id
toyed
with
the
engine
and
rolled
the
stupid
thing

were

i
love
the
keyless
entry
on
my
tbird
its
great
for
those
times
that
i
had
to
stop
to
put
air
in
my
tires
i
could
get
out
and
lock
the
door
with
the
engine
running
while
i
ran
around
to
air
up
the
tire
it
also
i
had
a
great
feature
on
my
tbird
i
could
pull
the
key
out
and
leave
the
ignition
on
this
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
the
first
time
it
happened
but
i
kinda
grew
to
like
it
musta
been
a
bad
key
copy
or
something
