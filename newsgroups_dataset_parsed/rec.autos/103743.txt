EACH
VALENTINE
IS
HAND
TUNED
TO
MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE
IS
ALL
THE
RADAR
BANDS
OF
COVERAGE
THIS
OF
COURSE
ADDS
TO
THE
LABOR
COST
AND
IN
TURN
THE
COST
OF
THE
UNIT
I
LIVE
IN
THE
BACKYARD
OF
THE
FOLKS
WHO
MAKE
THE
STALKER
RADAR
SYSTEM
THE
VALENTINE
HAS
SAVED
ME
MANY
MANY
MANY
TIMES
FROM
THE
STEALTH
REVENUE
ENHANCEMENT
TRAPS
OF
THE
LOCAL
AREA
I
HAVE
HAD
ALL
THE
MAJOR
BRAND
DETECTORS
AND
IMHO
NOTHING
ELSE
EVEN
COMES
CLOSE
TO
THE
I
DONT
WORK
FOR
VALENTINE
I
AM
JUST
A
SATISFIED
USER
OF
THEIR
UNIT
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
THE
NITTY
GRITTY
DETAILS
ON
ALL
THIS
CALL
THE
NICE
FOLKS
AT
VALENTINE
RESEARCH
THEY
WILL
BE
MORE
THAN
HAPPY
TO
EXPLAIN
THEIR
PERSPECTIVE
ON
RADAR
DETECTION
AND
ANALYSIS
METHODS
THE
CALLS
FREE
AT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THERE
ARE
MORE
AND
MORE
BANDS
AVAILABLE
FOR
POLICE
RADAR
EACH
MONTH
I
HAVE
RECENTLY
PURCHASED
WITHIN
THE
LAST
MONTHS
THE
BEL
WHILE
IT
IS
NOT
A
PERFECT
DETECTOR
BY
ANY
MEANS
IT
DOES
DO
THE
JOB
FAIRLY
WELL
NOW
HOWEVER
I
PICK
UP
A
CAR
MAGAZINE
AT
THE
AIRPORT
AND
READ
ABOUT
THIS
SUPER
KA
WIDEBAND
WHICH
IS
A
SUPERSET
OF
THE
KA
WIDEBAND
THAT
THIS
LATEST
GENERATION
OF
DETECTORS
WAS
TOUTED
AS
COVERING
SO
NOW
BEL
HAS
A
NEW
SERIES
OF
DETECTORS
OUT
THAT
COVER
ALL
THE
USUAL
BANDS
X
K
KA
PHOTO
KA
WIDEBAND
AS
WELL
AS
THE
NEW
SUPER
KA
WIDEBAND
JUST
AS
THERE
COMES
A
POINT
OF
DIMINISHING
RETURNS
WHEN
CHASING
INCREASED
PC
COMPUTING
POWER
WITH
FASTER
AND
FASTER
CPUS
FOR
THE
AVERAGE
HOME
CONSUMER
AT
LEAST
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THERE
IS
NOW
THE
SAME
CONCERN
WITH
RADAR
DETECTORS
DOES
IT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
UPGRADE
JUST
MONTHS
AFTER
PURCHASING
MY
NEW
DETECTOR
IS
VALENTINE
UPGRADING
THEIR
EQUIPMENT
IF
SO
IT
MIGHT
BE
WORTH
IT
FOR
ME
TO
UPGRADE
TO
THE
VALENTINE
I
WAS
IN
THE
MARKET
FOR
A
VALENTINE
WHEN
I
PURCHASED
THE
BEL
BUT
THE
MONTH
WAITING
TIME
WAS
JUST
TOO
MUCH
FOR
ME
SINCE
I
HAD
INADEQUATE
PROTECTION
WITH
MY
PASSPORT
LIFE
WAS
MUCH
SIMPLER
WHEN
THERE
WAS
JUST
X
AND
K
BAND
AND
ESCORT
HAS
THE
BEST
EQUIPMENT
ON
THE
MARKET
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
NEED
TO
CONTINUOUSLY
SHOP
FOR
A
NEW
DETECTOR
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
FLOOD
OF
NEW
RADAR
BANDS
CEASES
WITH
THIS
NEW
SUPER
WIDEBAND
