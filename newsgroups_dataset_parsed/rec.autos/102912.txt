I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT

IVE
SAW
A
SIGN
ON
THE
BACK
OF
A
GREYHOUND
BUS
THAT
WARNS
YOU
THAT
YOUR
RADAR
DETECTOR
MAY
BE
SET
OFF
IT
DOESNT
EXPLAIN
WHY
BUT
IT
DOES
SET
OFF
MY
RADAR
DETECTOR
BECAUSE
GREYHOUND
HAS
APPARENTLY
GOTTEN
AROUND
TO
INSTALLING

A
WARNING
TO
THE

A
FEW
MONTHS
BACK
AT
THE
TIME
THEY
WERE
ONLY
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
INSTALLING
THE

THEY
DIDNT
MENTION
HOW
IT
WORKED
