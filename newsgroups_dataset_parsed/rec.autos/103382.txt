P
CALLISON
WRITES
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
ARGUE
THE
ISSUE
OF
CARRYING
WEAPONS
BUT
I
WOULD
ASK
YOU
IF
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
SERIOUSLY
ABOUT
SHOOTING
A
KID
FOR
SETTING
OFF
YOUR
ALARM
I
CAN
THINK
OF
WORSE
THINGS
IN
THE
WORLD
GLAD
YOU
GOT
OUT
OF
THERE
BEFORE
THEY
DID
ANYTHING
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
REASON
TO
FIRE
YOUR
GUN
I
THINK
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
KILL
TO
DEFEND
THEIR
PROPERTY
WHY
NOT
BE
HONEST
DO
YOU
REALLY
CARE
MORE
ABOUT
SCUM
THAN
ABOUT
YOUR
CAR
