WRITES
I
GOT
A
PRICE
QUOTE
OF
FOR
A
CAMRY
WABS
FROM
A
TOYOTA
DEALER
IN
EATONTOWN
I
CAME
BACK
TO
THAT
DEALER
IN
TWO
WEEKS
TO
SIGN
A
PURCHASE
AGREEMENT
THEN
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THE
SALESPERSON
MADE
AN
ERROR
IN
PRICING
I
WALKED
OUT
OF
THAT
DEALER
I
WONDER
IF
THIS
KIND
OF
PRACTICE
IS
COMMON
WITH
TOYOTA
DEALERS
IS
THE
PRICE
QUOTE
WRITTEN
ON
THE
SALESPERSONS
BUSINESS
CARD
BINDING
I
WOULD
APPRICATE
ANY
COMMENTS
I
HAD
A
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCE
WE
HAD
A
WRITTEN
QUOTE
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
MAILED
TO
US
FROM
THE
SALESMAN
AT
ONE
OF
THESE
NOHAGGLE
TOYOTA
DEALERS
FOR
A
CAMRY
XLE
WABS
LEATHER
ETC
THE
PRICE
SEEMED
FAIR
BUT
WHEN
WE
WENT
IN
TO
TAKE
THEM
UP
ON
THEIR
OFFER
THEY
DISCOVERED
THAT
CERTAIN
EXTRA
COST
ITEMS
HADNT
BEEN
INCLUDED
IN
THEIR
ORIGINAL
WRITTEN
QUOTE
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TOTALED
AN
EXTRA
AND
IN
SPITE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
HAD
A
WRITTEN
QUOTE
THEY
SAID
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
THEY
COULD
DO
BOTTOM
LINE
QUOTES
FROM
SALEMEN
ARE
WORTHLESS
AND
IT
APPEARS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
TOYOTA
DEALERS
THINK
THEYVE
GOT
SUCH
A
SUPERIOR
AUTO
THAT
THEY
DONT
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WE
WALKED
WENT
OUT
AND
BOUGHT
A
NEW
LH
CAR
EAGLE
VISION
TSI
AND
I
DONT
REGRET
IT
