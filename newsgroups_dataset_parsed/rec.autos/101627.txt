re
what
is
volvo
and
all
of
these
cars
are
driven
fairly
hard
none
of
them
are
at
the
head
of
a
line
of
cars
going
mphthe
first
two
spend
a
lot
of
their
operating
life
with
the
speedometer
peggedand
the
only
reason
the
doesnt
is
it
has
a
mph
speedo
what
i
want
to
know
ishave
all
you
people
who
hate
volvos
been
traumatized
by
someone
in
a
turbo
wagon
blowing
you
away
on
the
road
or
what
turbo
in
uk
was
good
for
useful
for
blowing
away
vw
beetles
though
i
believe
the
beetle
corners
better
i
can
say
without
any
doubt
that
i
have
never
been
blown
away
by
any
volvo
ever
ive
been
blocked
into
a
few
car
parks
though
by
shithead
volvo
owners
who
only
thought
theyd
be
a
few
minutes
this
does
not
happen
with
the
owners
of
any
other
makes
of
car
not
sure
how
long
the
small
shitbox
volvos
last
too
damn
long
the
worst
car
i
ever
drove
was
a
hired
in
power
handling
and
ride
it
was
reminiscent
of
something
from
the
without
the
character
the
only
ceased
production
a
couple
of
years
back
ive
only
been
a
passenger
in
the
big
volvos
but
that
was
enough
i
ought
to
go
for
a
test
drive
because
they
offer
some
neat
gifts
