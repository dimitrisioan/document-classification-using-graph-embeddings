EMERGENCY
BRAKE
ON
NISSAN
MAXIMA
JUST
A
QUICK
SIMPLE
QUESTION
REALLY
HOW
MANY
WHEELS
ARE
AFFECTED
BY
THE
EMERGENCY
BRAKE
ON
AN
NISSAN
MAXIMA
IVE
HEARD
THAT
ALL
FOUR
ARE
AFFECTED
BUT
THIS
WOULD
SEEM
UNUSUAL
TO
ME
I
THOUGHT
THE
EMERGENCY
BRAKE
ON
MOST
CARS
ONLY
AFFECTED
THE
REAR
WHEELS
ALSO
HOW
POWERFUL
IS
THE
EMERGENCY
BRAKE
USUALLY
ENOUGH
TO
LOCK
WHEELS
AT
HMMMM
I
JUST
HAVE
TO
WONDER
ABOUT
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
I
HEAR
OUTATIME
