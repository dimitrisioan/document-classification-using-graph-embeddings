says
i
was
worried
about
someone
stealing
my
oil
once
also
i
finally
decided
to
just
have
my
drain
plug
welded
shut
it
works
great
i
figure
that
when
i
add
three
or
four
quarts
when
the
oil
light
comes
on
every
month
or
so
that
its
just
as
good
or
better
than
the
old
wives
tale
of
changing
the
oil
and
filter
every
miles
works
for
me
i
must
say
i
did
the
same
thing
to
my
drain
plug
for
the
same
reasons
i
was
wondering
how
you
filled
your
crankcase
though
as
i
welded
my
hood
shut
also
out
of
fear
that
somebody
might
steal
my
airfilter
dod
the
significant
problems
we
face
cannot
be
solved
at
the
same
level
of
thinking
we
were
at
when
we
created
them
