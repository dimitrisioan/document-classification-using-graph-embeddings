WRITES
HOW
DO
I
SQUARE
THIS
WITH
A
RESPECTABLE
RESALE
VALUE
EASY
IF
ITS
EXPENSIVE
TO
BUY
NEW
ITS
GONNA
BE
EXPENSIVE
TO
BUY
USED
A
PATENTLY
FALSE
STATEMENT
TRY
THIS
LOGIC
ON
AN
ALFA
IN
FACT
MARKETPLACE
HAS
A
WONDERUFL
MECHANISM
TO
ADJUST
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
CARS
THAT
ARE
OVERPRICED
BY
THE
MANUFACTURER
IF
IT
IS
EXPENSIVE
TO
BUY
NEW
IT
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
EXPNESIVE
TO
BUY
USED
IN
FACT
IT
COULD
BE
REAL
CHEAP
TO
BUY
USED
DEPENDING
WHAT
THAT
CAR
IS
OF
COURSE
NOTE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
QUESTION
YOUR
STATEMENTS
ON
THE
RELIABILITY
OF
WRANGLER
I
HAVE
NEVER
OWNED
ONE
DRIVEN
ONE
OR
BEEN
IN
ONE
I
DO
LOVE
TO
HAVE
ONE
THOUGH
WHAT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IS
WHY
THIS
APPARENT
NEGLECT
OF
QUALITY
FOR
SO
MANY
YEARS
HAS
NOT
FILTERED
DOWN
INTO
THE
USED
MARKETIS
JEEP
SO
INTOXICATING
SO
IRRESISTABLE
AND
SO
SEDUCTIVE
AS
TO
MAKE
ITS
PURCHASE
A
FATAL
ATTRACTION
BIJAN
YEP
THEY
ARE
POPULAR
VEHICLES
YOU
DONT
SEE
A
LOT
OF
PREVIOUS
MODEL

ONES
SITTING
ON
DEALERS
LOTS
FOR
ANY
LENGHTH
OF

AFTER
THE

OUT
THE
THINGS

THEY
ARE
POPULAR
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
POPULAR
AND
HIGHPRICED
NEW
THEY
ARE
HIGH
PRICE
USED
VERY
SIMPLE
I
KNEW
THEY
WERE
OVERPRICED
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
IT
I
KNEW
THEY
HAD
A
TERRIBLE
RELIABILITY
RECORD
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
IT
BUT
I
DIDNT
EXPECT
ANYTHING
LIKE
I
GOT
ESPECIALLY
WITH
A
DEALER
NETWORK
UNABLE
TO
REPAIR
IT
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
HAS
QUICKLY
CURED
ME
OF
MY
INFATUATION
WITH
THE

DAVE
