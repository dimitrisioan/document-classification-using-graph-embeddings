re
manual
shift
bigots
i
prefer
a
manual
to
an
automatic
as
it
should
be
i
believe
that
automatics
should
only
be
manufactured
for
people
with
physical
disabilities
who
otherwise
would
not
be
able
to
drive
automatic
transmissions
allow
drivers
to
be
lazy
more
time
is
available
to
fiddle
with
the
radio
or
to
look
at
the
scenery
instead
of
concentrating
on
the
road
the
manual
transmission
keeps
the
drive
always
doing
something
granted
it
isnt
a
large
movement
plus
driving
should
be
fun
driving
a
manual
is
fun
driving
an
automatic
is
a
chore
in
the
case
of
shift
speed
automatics
can
be
made
to
shift
far
faster
that
any
human
could
move
a
stick
if
i
was
racing
id
want
and
automatic
for
normal
driving
go
with
the
manual
