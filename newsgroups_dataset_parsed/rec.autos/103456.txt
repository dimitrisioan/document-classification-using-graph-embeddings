THE
SAME
PROBLEM
WELL
I
HAVE
AN
TAURUS
GL
APPARENTLY
THEY
STILL
HAVENT
FIXED
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
ROTORS
IVE
GOT
MILES
ON
THE
CLOCK
AND
IM
GETTING
THE
ROTORS
AND
PADS
REPLACES
TONIGHTAT
MY
EXPENSE
OF
COURSE
TONY
I
OWNED
A
FORD
MUSTANG
THAT
HAD
ENDLESS
BRAKE
PROBLEMS
THE
BAD
THING
WAS
THAT
IT
HAD
ALL
OTHER
KINDS
OF
PROBLEMS
TOO
SPENT
MONTHS
IN
THE
SHOP
IN
THE
FIRST
YEARS
I
OWNED
IT
BOUGHT
NEW
SO
I
GOT
RID
OF
IT
AND
WILL
MORE
THAN
LIKELY
NOT
BUY
A
FORD
PRODUCT
IN
THE
FUTURE
THE
THING
THAT
REALLY
TICKED
ME
OFF
WAS
HOW
FORD
TREATED
ME
THEY
WERE
SUCH
JERKS
IT
WAS
UNBELIEVABLE
JOE
IN
THE
PAST
FEW
YEARS
I
HAVE
OWNED
MUSTANG
GTS
AND
NOW
OWN
A
TBIRD

THEY
ALL
HAVE
HAD
THIS
PROBLEM
THERE
WAS
A
RECALL
ON
THE
TBIRD
FOR
THE
BRAKE
PROBLEM
THE
FORD
DEALER
REPLACED
THE
ROTORS
AND
PADS
BUT
THE
ROTORS
WARP
AFTER
ABOUT
MILES
BETWEEN
THIS
PROBLEM
AND
THE
FIT

PROBLEMS
ON
THE
TBIRD
