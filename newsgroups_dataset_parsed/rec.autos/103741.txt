WRITES
HELLO
AUTO
ENTHUSIASTS
STUFF
DELETED
VIPER
ALSO
SELLS
SOME
FANCY
FIELD
DISTURBANCE
SENSOR
THAT
SUPPOSEDLY
DETECTS
PEOPLE
APPROCAHING
THE
CAR
THIS
IS
PRIMARILY
FOR
CONVERTIBLES
I
HAVE
A
CONVERTIBLE
AND
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
THIS
FEATURE
IN
DETAIL
ALPINE
ACTUALLY
MAKES
A
BETTER
RADAR
UNIT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
GET
ONE
OF
THESE
IT
HAS
ZONES
IN
IT
THAT
CAN
BE
SHUT
DOWN
INDEPENDENTLY
SO
THAT
IF
ONE
SIDE
OF
YOUR
CAR
HAS
PEDESTRIAN
TRAFFIC
OR
SOMETHING
ELSE
THAT
WOULD
TRIGGER
AN
ALARM
IT
SHUTS
DOWN
THE
ZONE
OR
RATHER
PULLS
IT
IN
TIGHTER
I
DONT
SEE
THE
REAL
BENEFIT
TO
THESE
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
A
CONVERTIBLE
THAT
YOU
LEAVE
THE
TOP
DOWN
ON
AVOID
THE
VOICE
ALARM
THAT
CAN
BE
ADDED
TO
THE
RADAR
PACKAGE
IT
TALKS
TO
PEOPLE
AS
THEY
WALK
BY
I
SAW
ONE
INSTALLED
ON
A
LOTUS
ESPRIT
THE
KIDS
WOULD
TAUNT
IT
SEEING
HOW
CLOSE
THEY
COULD
GET
BEFORE
IT
WARNED
THEM
TO
GET
BACK
THE
OWNER
FINALLY
DISABLED
IT
WHICH
DEFEATS

PURPOSE

THE

MORE
FREQUENTLY

IT
