BOB
HUTSON
WRITES
AFTER
AGREEING
TO
TERMS
I
SIGNED
THE
CONTRACT
AND
DROVE
HOME
IN
MY
NEW
CAR
LATER
THAT
SAME
NIGHT
I
NOTICED
THAT
THE
TERMS
IN
THE
WERE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
TERMS
I
HAD
AGREED
TO
I
MADE
THE
STUPID
MISTAKE
OF
NOT
CHECKING
EVERYTHING
ON
THE
CONTRACT
THIS
ALL
HAPPENED
LAST
SATURDAY
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THERE
IS
A
COOLINGOFF
LAW
ALLOWING
ME
THREE
DAYS
TO
RECONSIDER
THE
CONTRACT
IS
THIS
TRUE
CAN
ANYONE
POINT
ME
TO
THE
LAW
THE
TRANSACTION
HAPPENED
AT
THE
DEALERSHIP
IF
IT
MATTERS
THIS
COOLING
OFF
PERIOD
APPLIES
ONLY
IN
CERTAIN
SITUATIONS
LIK
EWHEN
YOU
ARE
SOLICITED
AT
HOME
I
ALSO
THINK
THE
COOLING
OFF
PERIOD
ENDS
IF
YOU
ACTUALLY
ACCEPT
THE
MERCHANDISE
IF
THIS
WERE
NOT
THE
CASE
ANY
CAR
BUYER
WOULD
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
RETURN
A
SLIGHTLY
USED
HIGHLY
DEVALUED
CAR
DAYS
AFTER
BUYING
IT
YEAH
THATS
THE
TRICK
IF
I
WANT
TO
BUY
A
NEW
CAR
ID
HAVE
A
FIREND
BUY
RETURN
ONE
THEN
GO
IN
AND
NEGOTIATE
A
BETTER
DEAL
ON
A
PREOWNED
USED
CAR
FOR
DISCUSSION
PURPOSES
ONLY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
IT
CAN
BE
PROVEN
ITS
POSSIBLE
THE
CHANGED
TERMS
COULD
BE
THROWN
OUT
THE
QUESTION
WILL
BE
WHETHER
THE
AGREEMENT
CONTAINS
A
MERGER
CLAUSE
SEE
UCC
PAROL
EVIDENCE
IF
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
WARRANTIES
THEN
OF
COURSE
UCC
SHOULD
BE
LOOKED
AT
BUT
WE
HAVE
SO
LITTLE
INFORMATION
THAT
NONE
OF
US
CAN
SAY
ANYTHING
CONCLUSIVE

THE
