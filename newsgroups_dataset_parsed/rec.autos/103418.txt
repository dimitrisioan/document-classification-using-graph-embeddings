WHAT
ABOUT
THE
RICE
IMPORT
ISSUE
OF
COURSE
IT
IS
NOT
CLOSED
UP
LIKE
A
SHELL
BUT
HOW
OPEN
IS
IT
COMPARED
TO
TO
US
JAPAN
IS
MUCH
MORE
OPEN
THAN
KOREA
YES
A
PONTIAC
GRAND
AM
SUFFERS
A
FACTOR
OF
INCREASE
IN
PRICE
WHEN
IT
IS
EXPORTED
TO
JAPAN
HOWEVER
A
DODGE
VEHICLE
THE
ONE
THAT
CONGRESSMAN
GEPHARDT
MENTIONED
SUFFERS
A
FACTOR
OF
INCREASE
IN
PRICE
WHEN
IT
IS
EXPORTED
TO
KOREA
A
FORD
TAURUS
SUFFERS
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
A
HONDA
ACCORD
COSTSI
AM
NOT
MAKING
THIS
IN
KOREA
JUST
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
WOULD
WANT
TO
BUY
A
HONDA
ACCORD
FOR
SOLUTION
ALL
SHIPS
CARRYING
KOREANMADE
VEHICLES
SHOULD
BE
RETURNED
TO
SEOUL
PRONTO
UNTIL
AS
SUCH
TIME
AS
KOREA
DECIDES
THAT
IT
WANTS
TO
ABIDE
BY
THE
RULES
OF
FREE
AND
FAIR
TRADE
WITH
THE
USA
AND
JAPAN
NOW
NOW
BEFORE
WE
GET
TOO
CARRIED
AWAY
HERE
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
OWNING
ANY
CAR
IN
KOREA
IS
A
LUXURY
THAT
ONLY
THE
RULING
CLASS
CAN
AFFORD
EVERY
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
WORTH
ITS
SALT
FINDS
SOME
REASON
TO
LEVY
A
TAX
ON
CAR
OWNERSHIP
LAST
I
HEARD
THERE
WERE
SEVEN
DIFFERENT
FEES
TO
PAY
TO
OWN
A
CAR
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
THE
SORT
OF
PETTY
BUREAUCRATIC
INEFFICIENCY
THAT
NEW
PRESIDENT
KIM
YOUNG
SAM
WANTS
TO
ERADICATE
BASICALLY
I
THINK
THE
RULES
CAME
INTO
PLACE
AS
BUREAUCRATS
FROM
PLEBIAN
BACKGROUNDS
WANTED
TO
WREAK
REVENGE
ON
THE
RULING
CLASS
IN
EXCHANGE
ZAIBATSUS
LIKE
HYUNDAI
SCREWED
OVER
SMALLER
COMPANIES
PERPETUATING
A
VICIOUS
CYCLE
I
HAVE
FAITH
THAT
KOREAN
PEOPLE
CAN
POTENTIALLY
BUILD
CARS
AS
WELL
AS
ANYONE
ELSE
BUT
FOR
NOW
HYUNDAI
CARS
SEEM
TO
REFLECT
THE
TENSIONS
WITHIN
SOCIETY
OF
SCREWY
COMPONENTS
THAT
WONT
WORK
TOGETHER
STUBBORN
LIKE
A
MULE
THE
CAR
EITHER
WONT
GO
FORWARD
OR
WONT
STOP
AT
ALL
