are
there
any
owners
or
motorhead
gurus
out
there
that
know
why
my
engine
sounds
noisy
the
engine
is
noisy
at
the
best
of
times
but
not
even
a
nice
nose
its
one
of
those
very
ugly
noises
assuming
yours
is
a
non
turbo
the
gruffness
is
characteristic
of
a
large
inline
that
doesnt
have
balance
shafts
i
guess
toyota
didnt
care
about
little
details
like
that
when
they
can
brag
about
the
mid
engine
configuration
and
the
flashy
styling
myself
i
automatically
cross
out
any
car
from
consideration
or
recommendation
which
has
an
inline
larger
than
liters
and
no
balance
shafts
it
is
a
good
rule
of
thumb
to
keep
in
mind
if
you
ever
want
a
halfway
decent
engine
if
the
noise
really
bugs
you
there
is
nothing
else
that
you
can
do
except
to
sell
it
and
get
a
eliot
eliot
is
right
about
liter
engine
in
the
second
and
last
generation
but
the
original
guy
did
not
indicate
the
year
of
his
if
its
a
first
generation
car
like
my
it
has
liter
engine
or
perhaps
same
engine
with
a
supercharger
if
its
the
sound
he
describes
is
common
to
any
older
toyota
engine
i
ever
heard
i
dont
know
the
relevance
of
his
observations
about
oil
changes
my
simply
makes
noise
not
all
that
annoying
mind
you
but
you
hear
it
well
when
the
engine
is
right
behind
your
left
ear
mikes
