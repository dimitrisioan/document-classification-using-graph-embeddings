CHEVY
SPRINT
I
HAVE
A
CHEVY
SPRINT
WITH
AC
AND
ITS
ODOMETER
TURNED
AND
THE
SENSOR
LIGHT
STARTED
BLINKING
I
WENT
TO
THE
DEALER
AND
HE
SAID
IT
WAS
A
MAINTENANCE
LIGHT
SAYING
I
NEED
TO
CHANGE
THE
OXYGEN
SENSOR
HE
SAID
IT
IS
TO
BE
CHANGED
EVERY
BUT
SINCE
I
BOUGHT
THE
CAR
WHEN
IT
HAD
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THE
SAME
THING
HAPPENED
AT
AND
HE
QUOTED
FOR
THE
PART
AND
TO
INSTALL
IT
THE
PART
COST
OUTSIDE
BUT
THE
MECHANIC
I
WENT
TO
COULD
NOT
FIX
IT
SAYING
THE
SENSOR
IS
PLACED
TOO
DEEP
IN
THE
ENGINE
PARTS
HE
SUGGESTED
I
WAIT
TILL
IT
MALFUNCTIONS
BEFORE
I
DO
ANYTHING
IF
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
OWNS
A
CHEVY
SPRINT
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
HOW
THEY
GOT
THEIR
OXYGEN
SENSORS
CHANGED
ALSO
DID
YOU
FACE
ANY
PROBLEM
WITH
FIXING
IT
WITHOUT
THE
DEALERS
HELP
ALSO
WHAT
ARE
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
OXYGEN
SENSOR
MALFUNCTION
ANY
HELP
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECISTED
THANKS
