AN
AUDIBLE
ALARM
IS
JUST
AN
ANNOYANCE
TO
EITHER
A
PROFESSIONAL
OR
AMATEUR
NOBODY
LISTENS
TO
AUDIBLE
ALARMS
ANYMORE
THE
THIEVES
KNOW
THIS
IS
WHY
I
THINK
THERE
OUGHT
TO
BE
A
HEAVY
FINE
ON
FALSE
ALARMS
IM
REALLY
HONKED
OFF
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
DUE
TO
ALL
THE
CARS
WITH
CRUDDY
ALARMS
CRYING
WOLF
NO
ONE
WILL
PAY
ANY
ATTENTION
TO
MY
CAR
IF
ITS
ALARM
EVER
GOES
OFF
FOR
REAL
DEPENDS
ON
YOUR
AREA
IN
THE
CITY
NOBODY
THINKS
ABOUT
ITBUT
AT
A
MALL
OR
SOMETHING
NEAR
THE
SUBURBS
PEOPLE
DO
AT
LEAST
GLANCE
OVER
REMEMBER
AN
ALARM
IS
ONLY
A
DETERENT
NOT
A
PREVENTION
IF
A
THIEF
SEES
TWO
CARS
HE
LIKES
ONE
HAS
AN
ALARM
AND
THE
OTHER
DOESNT
HES
OBVIOUSLY
GOING
TO
SKIP
THE
ALARMED
CAR
AND
AVOID
THE
HASSLE
THERE
IS
A
WAY
AROUND
EVERY
ALARM
BUT
AT
LEAST
YOUVE
GOT
SOMETHING
ON
YOUR
SIDE
