for
honda
civic

hello
i
am
looking
to
slightly
increase
the
performance
of
my
honda
civic
si
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
suggest
upgrades
that
were
not
too
drastic
i
thought
that
one
of
the
easiest
upgrades
would
be
a
new
header
does
anyone
know
what
kind
of
increase
that
the
header
would
give
me
i
think
i
would
check
with

the
part

other
comparines

make
honda
parts

there
any
other
small
changes
that
can
be
easily
made
and
wont
screw
up
the
car
things
like
new
injectors
new
fuel
injection
chip
etc
i
would
welcome
any
suggestions
of
small
changes
that
would
make
a
difference
i
dont
really
want
to
change
the
cam
etc
because
i
have
heard
that
it
would
be
much
harder
on
the
engine
