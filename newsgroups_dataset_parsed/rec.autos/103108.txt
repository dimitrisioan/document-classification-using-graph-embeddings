JUST
ORDERED
A
SATURN
AFTER
CONSIDERING
A
FEW

FRANKLY
THE
SATURN
WAY
OF
DOING
BUSINESS

SERVICE
WAS
A
VERY
BIG
PLUS
I
HADNT
BOUGHT
A

I
BOUGHT
MY
HONDA
BACK
IN
AND
I
WAS
UNBELIEVEABLY
OFFENDED
BY
MOST
SALESPEOPLE
I
MET

WAS
INDEED
VERY
DIFFERENT

MADE
THREE
DIFFERENT
VISITS
TO
THE

NEVER
PRESSURED

HAD
THE
BEST
AFTERSALES
SUPPORT
