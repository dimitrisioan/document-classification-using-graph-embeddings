is
an

enough

ashtrays
smokers
seem
to
think
its
just
fine
to
use
the
road
oh
sure
sorry
but
the
absence
of
a
cupholder
is
not
gonna
discourage
anyone
from
eatingdrinking
in
the
car
lets
just
put
one
in
anyway
so
at
least
they
dont
have
the
further
distraction
of
trying
not
to
spill
it

are
obviously
not
a

it
takes
a
certain
skill
to
toss
a

will

along

its
sad
watching
those

old
ladies
try
to
load
their
groceries
into
the

with
that

fake
