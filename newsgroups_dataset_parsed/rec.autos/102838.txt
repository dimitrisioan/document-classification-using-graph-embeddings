re
manual
shift
bigots
in
recautos
you
write
if
ayrton
senna
can
drive
a
racecar
with
fully
automatic
transmission
it
cant
be
half
bad
this
mclaren
autotransmission
i
still
think
its
only
half
auto
but
you
may
be
right
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
gm
chrysler
volvo
or
whatever
auto
transmission
its
a
normal
manual
transmission
gearbox
with
clutch
and
all
but
there
are
servo
motors
which
do
the
shifting
that
means
there
is
no
power
loss
in
the
drivetrain
if
you
take
out
minimal
mechanical
friction
and
the
samiauto
transmissions
ferrari
williams
mclaren
dont
tell
you
when
to
shift
either
however
these
transmissions
share
an
important
disadvantage
with
your
stock
autotrannie
they
are
expensive
as
long
as
these
servoshifted
gearboxes
arent
available
on
normal
cars
im
gonna
stick
with
my
manual
i
just
cant
see
an
advantage
to
make
up
for
two
grand
i
lose
in
this
deal
and
the
loss
in
mileage
and
power
except
maybe
in
real
heavy
traffic
but
then
i
drive
mostly
on
the
autobahn
and
country
roads
anyway
theres
no
point
in
making
a
religion
out
of
this
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
a
few
technical
facts
and
my
own
opinion
so
theres
no
need
for
a
flame
war
eliot
have
a
safe
ride
