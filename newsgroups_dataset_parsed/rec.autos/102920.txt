RE
DUMBEST
AUTOMOTIVE
CONCEPTS
OF
ALL
TIME
NO
REVERSE
LIGHTS
ARE
TO
WARN
OTHERS
THAT
YOU
ARE
BACKING
UP
THEY
ARENT
BRIGHT
ENOUGH
TO
TYPICALLY
SEE
BY
WITHOUT
THE
BRAKE
AND

LIGHTS
CRAIG
PERHAPS
INSTEAD
OF
THIS

SERVE

DUAL

BEHIND
YOUR
CAR

THAT
YOU
HAVE
IT
IN
REVERSE
AND
THAT
THEY
CAN
ALSO

YOUR
CAR

YOURE
BACKING
UP

CAN
SEE

ON
CURRENT

ARE
MUCH
BRIGHTER

THEY
USED
TO
BE
ON
OLDER

ON
MY
TAURUS
WAGON
ARE
QUITE
BRIGHT
ENOUGH
TO
ILLUMINATE
A
GOOD
AREA
BEHIND
THE
CAR
AND
THEYRE
MUCH
BRIGHTER
THAN
THOSE
ON
MY
EARLIER
CARS

LOOK
AT
A

OR
PERHAPS
A
