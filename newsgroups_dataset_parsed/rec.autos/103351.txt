WHARFIE
WRITES
REMEMBER
ROADS
IN
AMERICA
ARE
NOT
DESIGNED
FOR
SPEEDS
ABOVE
MEANING
THEY
WOULD
BE
SAFE
AT
ROADS
LIKE
THE
AUTOBAHN
ARE
SMOOTHER
STRAITER
WIDER
AND
SLIGHTLY
BANKED
WELL
THATS
NEWS
BEFORE
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
ON
TEXAS
HIGHWAYS
WAS
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
ON
THE
NEW
JERSEY
TURNPIKE
WAS
THERE
WERE
NO
SPEED
LIMITS
IN
NEVADA
OR
MONTANA
I
GUESS
I
WASNT
CLEAR
ENOUGH
HERE
I
SAID
THE
ROADS
WERE
DESIGNED
FOR
SPEEDS
OF
OR
SO
AND
STILL
BE
SAFE
THE
CURRENT
WILL
ADD
A
SAFTEY
MARGIN
ACTUALLY
THE
ROADS
WERE
DESIGNATED
AS
SAFE
AT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BUILT
IN
THE
TAKING
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
KINDS
OF
CARS
THEN
AVAILABLE
THE
NUMBER
WOULD
BE
MUCH
HIGHER
TODAY
BECAUSE
THE
CARS
TIRES
AND
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
HAS
IMPRIVOVED
A
LOT
I
BELIEVE
THE
INTERSTATES
WERE
ORIGIONALLY
FUNDED
AS
PART
OF
A
NATIONAL
DEFENSE
PLAN
ETC
THE
REQUIREMENTS
WERE
TO
MOVE
HEAVY
ARMY
TRUCKS
AT
STILL
ITS
AMAZING
IN
GERMANY
YOU
CAN
HAVE
CARS
TRAVELING
MPH
AND
MPH
ON
THE
SAME
TO
LANE
ROAD
AROUND
WASHINGTON
DC
THEY
CANT
KEEP
TRAFFIC
FLOWING
AT
DIRK
