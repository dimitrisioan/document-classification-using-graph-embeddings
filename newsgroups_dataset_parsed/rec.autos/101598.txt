RADAR
AND
MAILED
TICKETS
MAKE
NO
SENSE
AT
ALL
SPEEDING
IS
A
MOVING
VIOLATION
COMMITTED
BY
THE
OPERATOR
NOT
THE
OWNER
THE
OWNER
MAY
BE
A
RENTAL
AGENCY
A
DEALER
A
PRIVATE
PARTY
OR
A
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
AS
LONG
AS
THE
OWNER
HAS
NO
REASON
TO
EXPECT
THE
OPERATOR
WILL
BE
DRIVING
ILLEGALLY
OR
UNSAFELY
THE
OWNER
CANNOT
BE
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
WHAT
THE
OPERATOR
DOES
THE
CAR
MAY
EVEN
HAVE
BEEN
DRIVEN
WITHOUT
THE
OWNERS
KNOWLEDGE
OR
CONSENT
I
CANT
BELIEVE
A
MAILED
TICKET
WHERE
THE

IS
NOT
IDENTIFIED
WOULD
STAND
UP
IN

THIS
IS
OBVIOUSLY
A
LAZY
CYNICAL
BONEHEADED
FASCIST
WAY

NOTHING
