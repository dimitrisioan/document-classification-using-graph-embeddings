i
too
was
puzzled
by
this
obvious
untruth
what
i
think
is
going
on
is
that
nissan
claims
that
the
altima
is
the
best
selling
new
car
namelplate
in
the
us
i
think
i
have
this
near
verbatim
lee

statistics
dept
would
have
been
proud
of
that
sentence
note
that
the
corollaprism
are
also
new
designs
but
hey
are
not
new
nameplates
i
guess
nissan
doesnt
even
sell
as
many
altimas
as
toyota
does
corollas
or
there
would
be
no
nameplate
qualifier
but
waiiiiiit
isnt
nissan
officially
registering
the
car
as
far
as
government
paperwork
goes
nissan
stanza
altima
to
avoid
costly
and
lengthy
paperwork
i
read
this
on
the
net
a
while
ago
and
someone
actually
may
have
said
theres
a
little
stanza
logo
on
the
altima
somewhere
you
can
have
it
both
ways
