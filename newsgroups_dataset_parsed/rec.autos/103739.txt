HAS
BEEN
TRIMMED
I
HAVE
HAD
MY
PROBE
LOOKED
AT
TWICE
BY
MY
LOCAL
DEALER
WHERE
I
PURCHASED
THE
CAR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THEY
MADE
THIS
PROBLEM
WORSE
THE
SECOND
TIME
AFTER
ADVISING
THEM
OF
THE
SERVICE
BULLETIN
MENTIONED
ON
MY
FORDPROBE
MAILING
LIST
THEY
SAID
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
OF
THE
BULLETIN
THEY
ADJUSTED
THE
WINDOW
AND
MADE
IT
MUCH
BETTER
HOWEVER
IT
NOW
MAKES
A
SCRITCH
SCRITCH
NOISE
ON
ROUGH
ROADS
AND
STILL
SQUEALS
WHEN
I
OPENCLOSE
THE
WINDOW
IN
WET
WEATHER
ANYONE
ELSESS
DO
THIS
IVE
NOT
HAD
ANY
OF
THE
AIR
OR
LEAKAGE
PROBLEMS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
REPORTED
BUT
DO
GET
THE
SQUEAL
THAT
BILL
DESCRIBES
I
LIVE
IN
SEATTLE
SO
THE
WET
WEATHER
MAY
BE
A
FACTOR
FORD
ONLY
GIVES

WITH

CMON

SPEND
AN
EXTRA
FEW
PENNIES

I
RECALL
CORRECTLY
I
GOT

BUTTONS
ARE
TERRIBLE
THIS
IS
TRUE
IM
WONDERING
IF
THIS
MAY
BE
A
SAFETY
CONCERN
IE
IF
PEOPLE
POUND
ON
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THE
AIRBAG
LIVES
SPEAKING
OF
THE
HORN
I
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
THAT
THE
PROBE
COMES
WITH
ONE
OF
THOSE
NICE
MERICAN
SOUNDING
HORNS
INSTEAD
OF
THE
JAPANESE
SOUNDING
KIND
THE
PREVIOUS
PROBES
HAD
JAPANESE
HORNS
NO
OPINION
TRANSMISSION
THE
SPEED
IS
A
MUST
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
A
GUY
ALMOST
EVERY
CAR
IVE
EVER
OWNED
HAS
BEEN
A
BECAUSE
I
GOT
A
GOOD
DEAL
ON
THIS
CAR
WITH
THE
MILES
I
KNOWINGLY
OVERLOOKED
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
HAS
AN
AUTOMATIC
BUT
IT
IS
A
PRETTY
HIGHTECH
AUTOMATIC
IT
IS
A
FULLY
ELECTRONICALY
CONTROLLED
WITH
THE
SPEED
IS
MUCH
MORE
FUN
WE
OPTED
FOR
THE
AUTOMATIC
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
BUT
ITS
STILL
FUN
AND
IN
SOME
WAYS
MORE
PRACTICAL
NO
SHAKERATTLE
NOISES
WHEN
GOING
OVER
BUMPSPOTHOLES
STILL
DITTO
SHAKES
AND
RATTLES
HAS
BEEN
MY
MAIN
GRIPE
IVE
GOTTEN
THEM
TO
FIX
THE
WORST
OF
THEM
BUT
I
FEAR
THAT
WITH
THE
RATHER
HARSH
RIDE
THE
CAR
WILL
BE
A
VIRTUAL
POTPOURI
OF
RATTLES
WHEN
IT
GETS
OLDER
I
TOO
WOULD
SUSPECT
THAT
THIS
MAY
BE
TRUE
TIRES
GOODYEAR
EAGLES
LEFT
HOPING
FOR
VERY
VERY
VERY
WELL
IT
STICKS
TO
THE
ROAD
LIKE
GLUE
EVEN
ON
A
ROUGH
SURFACE
YES
INTERIOR
IS
VERY
VERY
NICE
TOO
VERY
PLEASING
TO
THE
EYE
AND
ERGONOMICALLY
SOUND
DEFINITELY
FORDMAZDA
DID
A
VERY
VERY
NICE
JOB
ON
THIS
ONE
THE
CAR
HAS
A
MUCH
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
IT
ACTUALLY
IS
LOOK
AND
FEEL
TO
IT
DITTO
YES
THIS
CARS
STIFF
SUSPENSION
ISNT
FOR
EVERYONE
I
PERSONALLY
LIKE
IT
BUT
IF
YOU
FIND
IT
A
LITTLE
HARSH
BUT
OTHERWISE
LIKE
THE
CAR
ID
STRONGLY
SUGGEST
LOOKING
INTO
THE
AGREE
CHECK
IT
OUT
I
DONT
MIND
IT
BUT
WOULD
SAY
THAT
IF
IT
WAS
MUCH
STIFFER
IT
MIGHT
BE
A
PROBLEM
HOW
ABOUT
THE
FOR
SUSPENSION
WELL
I
WOULDNT
ENCOURAGE
PASSENGERCARRYING
IN
THE
PROBE
UNLESS
THE
PERSON
IN
THE
FRONT
SEAT
LIKES
TO
SIT
WITH
HIS
KNEES
TO
THE
DASH
AS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
CONSUMER
REPORTS
WRITEUPS
CONSIDER
THE
BACK
SEAT
AS
A
PARCEL
SHELF
NO
BIGGIE
TO
ME
THOUGH
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
ID
NOT
HAVE
BOUGHT
THE
CAR
BUT
ITS
DEFINITELY
NOT
A
FAMILY
CAR
TRUE
IVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
EXHAUST
SYSTEM
HAS
TROUBLE
BUT
MINE
WORKS
FINE
I
HAVENT
HEARD
ABOUT
THIS
ONE
I
KNOW
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
VERY
EARLY
PROBES
AND
MAYBE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
PREMATURELY
RUSTING
MUFFLERS
WHICH
IVE
HAD
THIS
PROBLEM
AND
READ
ABOUT
IT
OR
AT
LEAST
I
ASSUME
THE
ONE
I
HAD
WAS
THE
ONE
I
READ
ABOUT
IN
ANY
CASE
WHAT
HAPPENED
WAS
THE
WELD
BETWEEN
THE
MUFFLER
AND
THE
PIPE
FEEDING
IT
OK
SO
IM
NOT
A
MECHANIC
BROKE
IN
MY
CASE
THE
DEALER
WELDED
IT
ORDERED
REPLACEMENT
PARTS
AND
PUT
THEM
ON
WHEN
THEY
GOT
THEM
I
SUSPECT
THIS
IS
SOME
SORT
OF
DESIGN
FLAW
OR
PRODUCTION
FLAW
IN
ANY
CASE
I
HAVE
AN
EARLIER
MODEL
AND
WOULD
EXPECT
IT
TO
BE
WORKED
OUT
ON
NEWER
ONES
IN
ANY
CASE
IT
IS
A
WARRANTEE
REPAIR
OR
THEY
GET
THE
KEYS
BACK
FROM
WHAT
IVE
HEARD
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
FORDMAZDA
HAD
SOME
QC
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
PROBE
AND
PROBABLY
WHEN
THEY
FIRST
WENT
INTO
PRODUCTION
BUT
I
THINK
THESE
PROBLEMS
HAVE
MOSTLY
BEEN
CORRECTED
AT
THIS
POINT
THATS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
TO
BE
EXPECTED
WITH
A
COMPLETELY
NEW
CAR
LIKE
THIS
THOUGH
I
HAVE
TO
AGREE
THAT
THEY
SEEM
TO
HAVE
SOME
QC
PROBLESM
BUT
I
SERIOUSLY
FEEL
THE
CAR
DESIGN
IS
SOUND
AND
EXPECT
IT
TO
DO
VERY
WELL
I
SECOND
THIS
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
SOME
THINGS
THAT
SLIPPED
THROUGH
BUT
THE
CAR
SEEMS
VERY
SOUND
WHILE
NOT
PERFECTION
WHAT
IS
YOU
GET
AN
AWFUL
LOT

YOUR
MONEY
