the
biggest
hurdle
for
automatics
imho
is
not
shifting
speed
per
se
but
rather
the
transmissions
reaction
speed
when
you
try
to
force
it
to
shift
manually
i
rented
an
oldsmobile
achieva
is
that
a
yuppie
name
or
what
and
a
nissan
stanza
they
both
had
automatics
im
a
manual
transmission
bigot
but
i
have
to
admit
that
the
transmissions
on
these
cars
were
better
shifters
than
i
am
and
yes
they
responded
very
quickly
to
kickdown
requests
the
nissan
had
a
tachometer
so
i
was
able
to
figure
out
which
gear
i
was
in
the
olds
may
have
also
but
i
dont
remember
i
believe
it
shifted
all
the
way
down
to
second
at
about
mph
when
my
foot
told
it
no
i
really
want
to
accelerate
quickly
i
would
still
prefer
a
manual
but
i
wont
delude
myself
into
thinking
that
i
can
outaccelerate
a
modern
automatic
and
im
very
smooth
at
shifting
but
certainly
not
as
good
as
an
automatic
