JEFF
HAGEN
WRITES
THE
BIGGEST
HURDLE
FOR
AUTOMATICS
IMHO
IS
NOT
SHIFTING
SPEED
PER
SE
BUT
RATHER
THE
TRANSMISSIONS
REACTION
SPEED
WHEN
YOU
TRY
TO
FORCE
IT
TO
SHIFT
MANUALLY
I
RENTED
AN
OLDSMOBILE
ACHIEVA
IS
THAT
A
YUPPIE
NAME
OR
WHAT
AND
A
NISSAN
STANZA
THEY
BOTH
HAD
AUTOMATICS
IM
A
MANUAL
TRANSMISSION
BIGOT
BUT
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
THAT
THE
TRANSMISSIONS
ON
THESE
CARS
WERE
BETTER
SHIFTERS
THAN
I
AM
AND
YES
THEY
RESPONDED
VERY
QUICKLY
TO
KICKDOWN
REQUESTS
THE
NISSAN
HAD
A
TACHOMETER
SO
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHICH
GEAR
I
WAS
IN
THE
OLDS
MAY
HAVE
ALSO
BUT
I
DONT
REMEMBER
I
BELIEVE
IT
SHIFTED
ALL
THE
WAY
DOWN
TO
SECOND
AT
ABOUT
MPH
WHEN
MY
FOOT
TOLD
IT
NO
I
REALLY
WANT
TO
ACCELERATE
QUICKLY
I
WOULD
STILL
PREFER
A
MANUAL
BUT
I
WONT
DELUDE
MYSELF
INTO
THINKING
THAT
I
CAN
OUTACCELERATE
A
MODERN
AUTOMATIC
AND
IM
VERY
SMOOTH
AT
SHIFTING
BUT
CERTAINLY
NOT
AS
GOOD
AS
AN
AUTOMATIC
