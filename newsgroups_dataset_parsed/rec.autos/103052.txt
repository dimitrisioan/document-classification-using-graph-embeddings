WRITES
FYI
JUST
LAST
WEEK
THE
PBS
SHOW
MOTOR
WEEK
GAVE
THE
RESULTS
OF
WHAT
THEY
THOUGHT
WERE
THE
BEST
CARS
FOR
IN
THE
CONVERTIBLE
CATEGORY
THE
HONDA
CIVIC
DEL
SOL
ACHIEVED
THIS
HONOR
I
OWN
A
DEL
SOL
AND
I
MUST
VOUCH
FOR
THE
INTERIOR
I
REALLY
LOOKS
SNAZZY
WH
THE
TOP
IS
OFF
I
LOOKS
A
LOT
BETTER
IN
PERSON
THAN
ON
THE
TELEVISION
I
THAT
MOTORWEEK
AS
WELL
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
I
WAS
SMILING
A
BIT
BY
THE
TIME
IT
WAS
OVER
WATCH
OUT
FOR
THAT
DARNED
CONVERTIBLE
TAN
THO
I
SIMPLY
MUST
INQUIRE
HOW
CAN
PEOPLE
HONESTLY
CONSIDER
THIS
CAR
A
CONVERTIBLE
DOES
PORSCHE
HAVE
A
PATENT
ON
THE
TARGA
NAME
I
MEAN
CONVERTIBLE
TO
ME
MEANS
TOP
DOWN
WHICH
THE
DEL
SOL
CERTAINLY
DOES
NOT
DO
IT
HAS
THE
CENTER
THAT
LIFTS
OUT
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
WOULD
TERM
A
TARGAUNLESS
PORSCHES
WAS
GONNA
SUE
ME
FOR
DOING
THAT
I
KNOW
THE
REAR
WINDOW
ROLLS
DOWN
BUT
I
STILL
CAN
HARDLY
CONSIDER
THIS
CAR
TO
BE
A
CONVERTIBLE
YES
HOWEVER
WITH
THE
TOP
OFF
AND
THE
REAR
WINDOW
DOWN
THIS
CAR
IS
MORE
LIKE
A
CONVERTIBLE
THAN
A
COUPE
THINK
OF
IT
AS
A
CONVERTIBLE
WITH
AN
INTEGRATED
ROLLBAR
LIKE
ADDITION
