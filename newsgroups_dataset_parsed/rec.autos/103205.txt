your
help
with
a
problem
i
have
with
a
mitsubishi
galant
gs
transmission
the
car
has
a
speed
manual
tranmission
since
the
car
was
bought
new
while
shifting
from
to
unless
i
do
it
slowly
and
carefully
it
makes
a
popping
or
hitting
sound
the
dealer
and
mitsubishi
customer
service
reached
by
an
say
this
is
normal
for
the
car
is
it
and
about
a
year
ago
at
the
stick
shift
handle
got
stuck
while
attempting
to
put
it
in
reverse
the
shifter
would
not
budge
the
clutch
had
no
effect
the
front
tires
would
not
budge
even
when
the
clutch
is
fully
depressed
if
the
clutch
is
released
the
engine
would
die
assuming
that
some
gear
was
engaged
while
the
shifter
was
stuck
i
could
not
make
the
car
move
it
acted
as
if
it
were
in
neutralexcept
for
dying
when
clutch
is
released
i
finally
was
able
to
release
the
shifter
by
having
someone
rock
the
car
back
and
forth
less
than
an
inch
while
i
depressed
the
clutch
and
jiggled
the
shifter
the
shifter
acted
normally
after
that
when
this
happened
i
took
it
to
the
dealer
they
checked
the
clutch
it
was
ok
they
checked
the
transmission
it
was
ok
i
had
the
exact
problem
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
again
last
week
the
dealer
says
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
because
mitsubishi
the
says
they
have
never
heard
of
the
problem
and
the
dealer
could
not
reproduce
the
problem
while
they
had
the
car
in
all
three
occurances
the
car
was
parked
head
first
in
a
garage
and
since
the
front
wheels
were
stuck
the
car
could
not
be
towed
to
the
dealer
before
releasing
the
shifter
hence
temporarily
solving
the
problem
and
the
dealer
and
mitsubishi
refused
to
send
someone
to
check
the
car
while
it
was
stuck
i
know
there
is
smething
wrong
with
the
transmission
shifting
from
to
and
getting
stuck
at
random
but
i
cant
get
the
dealer
to
fix
it
i
need
your
help
with
the
mechanical
problems
and
with
how
to
handle
mitsubishi
all
hints
and
suggestions
are
greatly
appreciated
and
sorry
to
bore
you
with
the
long
post
thanks
rabih
try
another
dealer
sometimes
the
sophistication
of
equipment
etc
is
better
at
one
dealer
than
another
you
may
also
find
another
dealer
willing
to
help
you
with
the
problem
