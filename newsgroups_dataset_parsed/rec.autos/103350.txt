WATER
GRADUALLY
BUILDS
UP
IN
THE
TRUNK
OF
MY
FRIENDS
FORD
PROBE
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
SPARE
AND
SCOOP
OUT
THE
WATER
UNDER
THE
PLYWOODCARPET
COVER
ON
THE
TRUNK
I
WOULD
GUESS
THIS
USUALLY
I
NOTICED
THIS
IS
MY
PROBE
ALSO
WHEN
RECENTLY
CLEANING
OUT
THE
BACK
I
THINK
THE
WATER
IS
COMING
UP
THROUGH
SOME
RUBBER
STOPPERED
HOLES
BENEATH
THE
SPARE
MINE
LOOKED
SLIGHTLY
WORN
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
WATER
OR
WATER
DAMAGE
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
WITH
MY
PROBE
THE
WATER
IS
DEFINITELY
NOT
COMMING
UP
FROM
THE
RUBBER
STOPPERED
HOLE
BENEATH
THE
SPARE
I
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
RUBBER
STOPPER
TO
DRAIN
THE
WATER
SEEMS
LIKE
A
COMMON
PROBLEM
WITH
PROBE
THERE
IS
A
KNOWN
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
SEALS
ON
THE
TAILLIGHTS
OF
PROBES
COMPLAIN
LOUDLY
TO
YOUR
DEALER
AND
GET
THEM
TO
INSTALL
NEW
SEALS
IT
IS
A
KNOWN
PROBLEM
PRESENT
ON
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
PROBES
SO
YOU
SHOULDNT
HAVE
TO
PAY
THEM
TO
FIX
IT
IN
MY
CASE
THEY
FIXED
IT
ON
MY
EXTENDED
WARRANTY
I
JUST
HAD
TO
PAY
A
DEDUCTABLE
THE
WORK
WAS
VALUED
AT
SOMETHING
LIKE
WITH
LABOR
AND
PARTS
HAVING
REMOVED
THE
TAIL
LAMPS
MYSELF
ON
OTHER
OCCASIONS
I
THINK
THEIR
ESTIMATE
WAS
FAIR
