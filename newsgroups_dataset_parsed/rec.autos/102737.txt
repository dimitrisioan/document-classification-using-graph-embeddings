RE
BRAINDEAD
DRIVERS
WHO
DONT
LOOK
AHEAD
I
AGREE
THAT
IF
TRAFFIC
IS
ALL
BLOCKED
UP
AND
YOU
WANT
TO
PASS
YOU
MIGHT
NOT
FEEL
LIKE
MOVING
OVER
FOR
SOMEONE
BEHIND
YOU
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
GIVE
THEM
THAT
ONE
CARLENGTH
WHEN
THEY
SHOULD
JUST
WAIT
LIKE
YOU
ARE
BUT
IF
YOURE
ONE
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
THAT
JUST
SITS
BEHIND
THE
PERSON
AND
DOESNT
FLASH
THEM
WITH
THE
HIGH
BEAMS
OR
PULL
LEFT
AND
FLASH
THEM
OR
RIDE
THEIR
BUMPER
OR
OTHERWISE
TELL
THEM
THAT
YOU
DO
IN
FACT
WANT
TO
GO
BY
AND
YOURE
NOT
JUST
DRAFTING
THEM
THEN
GET
THE
HELL
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
OF
SOMEONE
WHO
WILL
I
ESPECIALLY
HATE
IT
WHEN
YOU
FLASH
SOMEONE
AT
THE
BACK
OF
A
LINE
AND
THEY
DONT
PASS
IT
ON
AND
THERES
ALSO
THE
ISSUE
OF
SOME
CARS
BEING
MORE
INTIMIDATING
TO
GET
PEOPLE
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
THAN
OTHERS
FOR
INSTANCE
GTS
LOOK
PRETTY
MEAN
IN
A
REARVIEW
MIRROR
AT
NIGHT
WITH
THE
FOGLIGHTS
ON
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
PLENTY
OF
TIMES
WHEN
IVE
BROKEN
UP
A
PACK
THAT
A
SECONDINLINE
HYUNDAI
HAS
BEEN
BEHIND
FOR
MILES
YOU
JUST
NEED
TO
KNOW
HOW
TO
GET
THEIR
ATTENTION
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
YOU
USE
THIS
METHOD
ON
A
COUPLE
OF
SEMI
DRIVERS
IF
THEY
SEE
YOU
THEY
USUALLY
ACKNOWLEDGE
BY
STICKING
THEIR
HAND
OUT
THE
WINDOW
WITH
THEIR
MIDDLE
FINGER
EXTENDED
BECAUSE
IT
IS
ALSO
OBVIOUS
TO
THEM
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
CLEAR
LANE
AHEAD
