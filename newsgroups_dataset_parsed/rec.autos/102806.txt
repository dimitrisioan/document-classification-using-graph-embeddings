this
happened
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of
ours
i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off
of
bridges
and
such
but
pound
rocks
has
our
society
really
stooped
this
low
yes
nobody
is
watching
them
if
they
get
caught
there
is
no
punishment
at
all
in
the
old
days
such
behaviour
would
be
rewarded
with
a
whipping
with
a
goodsized
belt
and
then
taken
into
some
hospital
to
see
first
hand
what
kind
of
damage
such
accidents
cause
of
course
this
doesnt
happen
any
more
that
whipping
would
probably
save
the
kids
life
by
teaching
him
some
respect
for
others
a
person
with
that
little
respect
would
inevitably
wind
up
dead
early
anyway
the
problem
is
creeping
gradualism
if
you
put
a
frog
into
hot
water
he
just
jumps
out
but
if
you
put
him
into
cold
water
and
then
everso
gradually
heat
it
the
frog
will
cook
this
is
what
the
entertainment
industry
and
lack
of
religious
moral
and
educational
standards
in
our
modern
north
american
society
have
done
to
us
over
the
years
now
that
we
are
about
to
be
cooked
we
may
have
woken
up
too
late
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
and
the
education
system
and
the
religious
leaders
arent
doing
much
about
it
either
with
both
parents
working
in
this
society
where
is
the
stabilizing
influence
at
home
latchkey
children
are
everywhere
and
these
latchkey
kids
can
watch
whatever
rotten
videos
and
listen
to
whatever
violent
hatepromoting
music
and
videos
they
like
because
no
one
is
home
to
stop
it
this
day
and
age
when
there
is
about
times
more
things
to
learn
than
when
i
went
to
school
our
answer
to
this
increased
knowledge
is
shorter
school
hours
and
more
leisure
time
i
say
keep
the
kids
in
school
longer
feed
them
good
food
and
teach
them
something
and
when
they
get
home
have
a
parent
there
to
interact
and
monitor
them
there
is
a
very
old
and
now
forgotten
proverb
a
child
left
on
his
own
will
bring
a
parent
to
grief
daycare
systems
are
not
the
answer
this
is
just
shifting
the
parents
own
responsibilities
off
on
someone
else
to
whom
its
not
a
lifelong
committment
but
rather
just
a
job
at
followups
