hello
auto
enthusiasts
i
recently
had
more
car
mangled
broken
into
and
decided
to
get
an
alarm
installed
its
a
viper
and
has
a
shock
sensor
sensors
for
each
door
ignition
cutoff
and
automatic
door
locks
i
have
this
same
alarm
installed
in
my
syclone
it
works
great
the
shock
sensor
is
very
sensitive
but
much
more
practical
than
the
motion
sensor
i
have
on
my
other
car
it
doesnt
trigger
if
the
car
is
rocked
gently
by
the
wind
but
any
kind
of
shock
sets
it
off
even
kicking
the
tire
sets
it
off
it
works
great
what
worries
me
is
the
hood
and
hatch
if
someone
could
pry
them
up
gently
enough
then
they
could
bypass
the
alarm
the
shock
sensor
is
adjustable
and
there
are
two
cycles
on
it
you
can
adjust
it
to
be
sensitive
enough
that
there
is
no
way
you
could
open
the
hood
without
setting
off
the
alarm
although
i
know
that
you
cannot
pop
the
hood
on
the
syclone
without
setting
off
my
alarm
now
and
yet
i
have
had
zero
none
false
alarms
with
this
system
the
alarm
tells
you
when
you
disarm
it
whether
it
has
been
activated
in
your
absence
i
have
been
able
to
trace
every
alarm
to
its
cause
and
it
was
not
a
false
alarm
im
also
wondering
how
easy
it
would
be
for
a
thief
to
crawl
underneath
the
car
and
cut
the
battery
cable
to
disable
the
alarm
i
guess
it
would
be
possible
depending
on
the
vehicle
my
syclone
is
so
tight
in
the
engine
compartment
that
it
would
be
tough
to
do
this
there
are
supplemental
power
supplies
you
can
put
on
with
this
viper
alarm
but
i
dont
have
one
i
really
think
that
if
someone
wants
my
car
that
bad
the
alarm
wont
keep
them
from
it
even
with
a
supplemental
power
supply
viper
also
sells
some
fancy
field
disturbance
sensor
that
supposedly
detects
people
approcahing
the
car
this
is
primarily
for
convertibles
i
have
a
convertible
and
have
looked
at
this
feature
in
detail
alpine
actually
makes
a
better
radar
unit
if
you
want
to
get
one
of
these
it
has
zones
in
it
that
can
be
shut
down
independently
so
that
if
one
side
of
your
car
has
pedestrian
traffic
or
something
else
that
would
trigger
an
alarm
it
shuts
down
the
zone
or
rather
pulls
it
in
tighter
i
dont
see
the
real
benefit
to
these
unless
you
have
a
convertible
that
you
leave
the
top
down
on
avoid
the
voice
alarm
that
can
be
added
to
the
radar
package
it
talks
to
people
as
they
walk
by
i
saw
one
installed
on
a
lotus
esprit
the
kids
would
taunt
it
seeing
how
close
they
could
get
before
it
warned
them
to
get
back
the
owner
finally
disabled
it
which
defeats
the
purpose
in
my
mind
im
interested
in
the
opinions
of
you
netters
about
these
problems
and
about
the
viper
in
general
i
am
real
happy
with
my
viper
one
other
feature
i
really
like
is
you
can
tune
it
to
your
preferences
you
can
have
it
arm
passively
or
not
you
can
disable
the
chirp
for
armingdisarming
you
can
have
it
lockunlock
the
doors
when
the
alarm
is
armeddisarmed
i
like
these
features
i
hate
the
chirp
when
the
alarm
armsdisarms
so
mine
flashes
the
lights
only
i
like
the
door
lock
feature
although
i
have
to
be
careful
to
take
my
keys
with
me
because
it
doesnt
know
if
you
have
left
your
keys
in
the
car
when
it
passively
arms
and
locks
the
doors
but
if
you
are
meticulous
about
taking
your
keys
with
you
it
takes
care
of
the
rest
the
car
is
an
ford
probe
gt
that
used
to
be
in
great
shape
ron
garnett
i
looked
seriously
at
the
alpine
system
too
it
is
a
real
nice
system
but
more
money
and
it
has
a
motion
sensor
standard
instead
of
the
shock
sensor
the
shock
sensor
is
betterand
the
viper
shock
sensor
is
better
cycle
than
the
optional
alpine
one
imho
i
think
the
viper
gives
you
a
lot
of
good
value
for
the
money
but
it
isnt
absolutely
tamperproof
no
system
is
except
maybe
the
one
that
james
bond
had
on
his
lotus
in
for
your
eyes
only
anyone
know
where
we
can
get
one
of
those
installed
maybe
that
was
what
they
had
in
the
van
in
the
world
trade
center
huh
merrill
