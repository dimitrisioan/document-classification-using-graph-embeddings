apologies
if
this
is
a
faq
is
there
a
faq
posting
for
this
group
i
am
an
infrequent
reader
of
recautos
so
i
cant
remember
i
am
in
the
market
for
a
used
chevy
suburban
and
have
observed
that
prices
for
models
with
diesel
engines
run
about
less
than
comparable
models
with
a
gas
engine
there
has
to
be
a
reason
for
this
yes
there
is
consumer
confusion
in
the
early
with
the
fuel
crisis
etc
everyone
wanted
better
fuel
mileage
diesel
fuel
was
the
cheapest
fuel
available
and
usually
provides
better
mileage
than
comparable
gasoline
engines
so
gm
decided
to
conver
their
gas
engine
into
a
diesel
engine
i
think
was
a
liter
big
mistake
the
engine
was
not
redesigned
but
converted
the
engine
could
not
handle
the
higher
compression
etc
lots
of
problems
with
these
cars
this
thew
up
a
big
red
flag
to
the
casual
observer
dont
buy
a
diesel
they
are
bad
this
was
a
gross
generalization
ask
yourself
this
question
if
your
livelihood
depended
on
driving
lots
of
it
would
you
use
a
dependable
or
undependable
but
cheaper
in
the
short
run
vehicle
what
do
greyhound
busses
have
in
them
trailer
trucks
even
train
locomotives
are
these
gasoline
engines
no
they
are
diesel
tractor
trailer
truck
manufacturers
provide
a
mile
warrantee
with
they
vehicles
i
own
an
diesel
suburban
the
diesel
is
a
great
engine
just
keeps
going
it
was
more
expensive
when
new
than
the
gasoline
engine
vehicle
was
the
only
problem
with
diesel
engines
is
that
when
they
need
to
be
rebuilt
they
are
expensive
in
a
gas
engine
you
will
pay
about
for
a
rebuild
diesel
is
about
but
then
again
the
diesel
engine
lasts
about
twice
as
long
and
gets
about
better
mileage
a
carburator
for
a
gasoline
engine
costs
about
to
rebuild
or
less
a
rebuild
of
the
fuel
injection
pump
on
a
diesel
will
cost
about
or
more
but
then
again
you
never
need
a
tuneup
if
youre
looking
at
a
rebuilt
id
say
you
got
a
great
deal
check
to
see
if
the
fuel
injection
pump
was
rebuilt
also
good
luck
