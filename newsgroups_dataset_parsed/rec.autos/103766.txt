im
not
going
to
argue
the
issue
of
carrying
weapons
but
i
would
ask
you
if
you
would
have
thought
seriously
about
shooting
a
kid
for
setting
off
your
alarm
i
can
think
of
worse
things
in
the
world
glad
you
got
out
of
there
before
they
did
anything
to
give
you
a
reason
to
fire
your
gun
i
think
people
have
a
right
to
kill
to
defend
their
property
why
not
be
honest
do
you
really
care
more
about
scum
than
about
your
car
yo
watch
the
attributionsi
didnt
say
that
again
this
isnt
an
appropriate
forum
for
discussions
on
whether
you
should
shoot
someone
for
property
damagevandalismtheft
but
every
responsible
gun
owner
realizes
that
there
are
limits
and
the
punishment
must
fit
the
crime
i
mean
think
about
itis
a
really
harmless
prank
worth
killing
over
as
i
said
the
situation
described
punks
setting
off
alarms
and
taunting
people
to
come
out
could
turn
very
ugly
very
quickly
and
it
is
worth
being
prepared
when
your
life
is
potentially
on
the
line
