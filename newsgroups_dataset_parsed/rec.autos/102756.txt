WRITES
EXPERIENCE
WITH
JEEP
SERVICE
DEPT
WHILE
NOT
EXACTLY
A
SERVICE
INCIDENT
I
HAD
A
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCE
RECENTLY
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
A
NEW
TRUCK
I
HAD
PICKED
OUT
THE
VEHICLE
I
WANTED
AND
AFTER
A
LITTLE
HAGGLING
WE
AGREED
ON
A
PRICE
I
WROTE
THEM
A
CHECK
FOR
THE
DOWN
PAYMENT
PLUS
TAX
AND
LICENSE
AND
TOLD
THEM
ID
BE
BACK
THAT
EVENING
TO
PICK
UP
THE
TRUCK
WHEN
I
RETURNED
I
HAD
TO
WAIT
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
BEFORE
THE
FINANCE
GUY
COULD
GET
TO
ME
WHEN
I
FINALLY
GOT
IN
THERE
EVERYTHING
WENT
SMOOTHLY
UNTIL
HE
STARTED
ADDING
UP
THE
NUMBERS
HE
THEN
DISCOVERED
THAT
THEY
HAD
MISCALCULATED
THE
TAX
LICENSE
BY
ABOUT
HE
THEN
SAID
HE
NEEDED
ANOTHER
FROM
ME
I
SAID
WE
HAD
ALREADY
AGREED
ON
A
PRICE
AND
IT
WAS
THEIR
PROBLEM
I
WASNT
GIVING
THEM
ANY
MORE
MONEY
THE
FINANCE
GUY
THEN
BROUGHT
IN
THE
MANAGER
ON
DUTY
WHO
PROCEEDED
TO
GIVE
ME
A
HARD
TIME
I
REMINDED
HIM
THAT
I
WAS
THE
CUSTOMER
AND
I
DIDNT
THINK
I
SHOULD
BE
TREATED
LIKE
THAT
AND
THAT
IF
HE
DIDNT
BACK
OFF
HE
COULD
FORGET
THE
WHOLE
DEAL
HE
MADE
SOME
SMART
REMARK
SO
I
TOLD
HIM
WHERE
HE
COULD
STICK
IT
SNATCHED
BACK
MY
CHECK
AND
LEFT
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THEY
WERE
NOT
PLEASED
BY
THE
TURN
OF
EVENTS
EARLY
THE
NEXT
MORNING
I
GOT
A
CALL
FROM
THE
GENERAL
SALES
MANAGER
WANTING
TO
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
I
RELATED
THE
STORY
AND
HE
APOLOGISED
PROFUSELY
AND
ASKED
IF
THERE
WAS
ANYTHING
THEY
COULD
DO
TO
CHANGE
MY
MIND
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
IF
THEY
GAVE
ME
THE
TRUCK
FOR
FREE
I
PROBABLY
STILL
WOULDNT
TAKE
IT
THAT
THERE
WERE
OTHER
DEALERS
IN
TOWN
I
WAS
A
REPEAT
CUSTOMER
OF
THEIRS
AND
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
LEARN
HOW
TO
TREAT
CUSTOMERSETCETCI
WAS
STILL
PRETTY
STEAMED
ABOUT
THE
WHOLE
AFFAIR
HE
GAVE
ME
THE
LINE
ABOUT
HATING
TO
LOSE
A
CUSTOMER
AND
THEY
WOULD
TRY
TO
FIND
A
SOLUTION
ETC
ETC
I
TOLD
HIM
NOT
TO
BOTHER
THANKS
ID
GO
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
A
COUPLE
HOURS
LATER
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
DEALERSHIP
CALLED
ME
ALL
APOLOGETIC
ETC
ETC
ETC
AND
SAID
THAT
THEY
WOULD
COVER
THE
PLUS
KNOCK
ANOTHER
OFF
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
TRUCK
I
TOLD
HIM
ID
THINK
ABOUT
IT
AND
HE
GAVE
ME
HIS
PRIVATE
DIRECT
PHONE
NUMBER
HIS
SECRETARYS
NAME
AND
ASSURED
ME
THAT
THEY
VALUED
ME
AS
A
CUSTOMER
ETC
ETC
ETC
I
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
FOR
A
FEW
HOURS
AND
DISCUSSED
IT
WITH
MY
WIFE
AND
WE
DECIDED
WHAT
THE
HELLTHAT
WAS
A
PRETTY
DECENT
DEAL
SO
I
CALLED
HIM
BACK
AND
ACCEPTED
HIS
OFFER
WHEN
I
WENT
BACK
THE
NEXT
DAY
TO
PICK
UP
THE
TRUCK
I
RECEIVED
THE
ROYAL
TREATMENT
EVERYONE
SEEMED
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
INCIDENT
EVEN
THE
LOT
BOY
EVERYTHING
WENT
SMOOTHLY
AND
I
WAS
OUT
OF
THERE
IN
MY
NEW
TRUCK
IN
ABOUT
MINS
SO
I
GUESS
IM
A
REASONABLY
SATISFIED
CUSTOMER
HOWEVER
IT
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
HAPPENED
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
I
WAS
A
BIT
SHOCKED
TO
HAVE
A
SALES
PERSON
TALK
TO
ME
LIKE
THAT
I
DONT
EXPECT
THEM
TO
BOW
AND
GROVEL
BUT
I
SURE
DONT
EXPECT
TO
BE
GIVEN
A
HARD
TIME
EITHER
ESP
WHEN
ITS
THEIR
MISTAKE
ANYWAY
IM
HAPPY
WITH
THE
TRUCK
AND
IT
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
A
COUPLE
HUNDRED
DOLLARS
UNDER
INVOICE
AND
THEY
PAID
MOST
OF
THE
FIRST
YEARS
LICENSE
FEE
IM
NOT
SURE
WHETHER
ILL
GO
BACK
TO
THAT
DEALER
THO
MARK
