WRITES
HERE
IS
A
STORY
I
BOUGHT
A
CAR
ABOUT
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
FINALLY
CAN
GET
HOLD
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
OF
THE
CAR
AND
GOT
ALL
MAINTANENCE
HISTORY
OF
THE
CAR
IN
BETWEEN
AND
THE
INSTRUMENT
PANNEL
OF
THE
CAR
HAS
BEEN
REPLACED
AND
THE
ODOMETER
ALSO
HAS
BEEN
RESET
TO
ZERO
THEREFORE
THE
TRUE
METER
READING
IS
THE
READING
BEFORE
REPLACEMENT
PLUS
CURRENT
MILEAGE
THAT
SHOWS
MILE
DIFFERENCE
COMPARING
TO
THE
MILEAGE
ON
THE
ODOMETER
DISCLOSURE
FROM
THE
DEALER
NEVER
TOLD
ME
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THAT
IMPORTANT
STORY
I
HOPE
THAT
I
CAN
RETURN
THE
CAR
WITH
FULL
REFUND
DO
U
THINK
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCES
ANY
COMMENTS
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED
THANKS
THIS
IS
A
TRICKY
SITUATION
IF
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
DIDNT
INFORM
THE
DEALER
OF
THE
ODOMETER
CHANGE
THEN
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
COMMITTED
FRAUD
AND
HE
MAY
BE
LIABLE
THE
DEALER
MAY
ALSO
BE
LIABLE
IF
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
NOTIFIED
THE
DEALER
OR
IF
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
HAD
THE
DASH
REPLACED
AT
A
DEALER
OR
IF
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
HAD
THE
DASH
CHANGED
LEGALLY
ANY
RECORDS
SEARCH
ON
THE
CAR
SHOULD
TURN
UP
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ODOMETER
HAD
BEEN
ALTERED
IF
A
DEALER
CHANGES
THE
SPEEDOMETER
HE
HAS
TO
REPORT
IT
IT
GOES
INTO
THE
CARS
SERVICE
RECORD
WITH
THE
MANUFACTURER
AND
ON
THE
TITLE
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
THE
DEALER
TOLD
ME
THAT
THE
OLD
MILEAGE
ETC
WERE
SENT
TO
FORD
WHEN
MY
TBIRDS
SPEEDO
WAS
REPLACED
IF
THE
ODOMETER
CAN
BE
SET
TO
THE
OLD
MILEAGE
IT
MUST
BE
IF
IT
CANT
EG
ELECTRICALLYDRIVEN
ODOMETERS
THEN
THE
MILEAGE
OF
THE
OLD
ODOMETER
MUST
BE
WRITTEN
ON
A
PERMANENT
STICKER
WHICH
IS
AFFIXED
TO
THE
DOOR
FRAME
OF
THE
VEHICLE
EITHER
WAY
IF
THE
CHANGE
HAD
BEEN
DONE
LEGALLY
THEN
A
RECORDS
SEARCH
WHICH
THE
DEALER
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
DID
SHOULD
HAVE
TURNED
IT
UP
