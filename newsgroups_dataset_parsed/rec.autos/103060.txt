WRITES
RECENTLY
I
SAW
AN
AD
FOR
THE
ALTIMA
WHICH
SAYS
THAT
IT
IS
THE
BEST
SELLER
FOR
THE
PAST
MONTHS
IS
THAT
TRUE
I
TOO
WAS
PUZZLED
BY
THIS
OBVIOUS
UNTRUTH
WHAT
I
THINK
IS
GOING
ON
IS
THAT
NISSAN
CLAIMS
THAT
THE
ALTIMA
IS
THE
BEST
SELLING
NEW
CAR
NAMELPLATE
IN
THE
US
I
THINK
I
HAVE
THIS
NEAR
VERBATIM
LEE
IACCOCAS
STATISTICS
DEPT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PROUD
OF
THAT
SENTENCE
WHAT
THEY
MEAN
I
THINK
IS
THAT
OF
ALL
TOTALLY
NEW
MODELS
IE
CARS
NEVER
SOLD
BEFORE
IN
ANY
FORM
THE
ALTIMA
IS
THE
BEST
SELLER
THEREBY
ELIMINATING
ACCORD
TAURUS
ETC
THIS
IS
FROM
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
WHO
MAKE
THE
CLAIM
THAT
OUR
MINIVAN
IS
OUTSELLIN
THEIRS
IMPLYING
THAT
THE
NISSAN
QUEST
MURCURY
VILLAGER
ARE
OUTSELLING
THE
CHRYSLER
MINIVANS
NOT
ONLY
IS
THIS
NOT
TRUE
AT
ALL
BUT
IT
WAS
A
STUPID
CLAIM
TO
MAKE
THE
COMMERCIAL
WAS
PART
OF
THE
INTRODUCTION
CAMPAIGN
FOR
THE
VANS
KIND
OF
A
BOLD
STATEMENT
TO
MAKE
WHEN
YOU
HAVENT
EVEN
SOLD
ONE
YET
EH
AND
I
THOUGHT
BUICK

OLDSMOBILE
WHERE
BAD
SHAME
ON
YOU
