SEVERAL
CHEMISTS
ALREADY
HAVE
COME
UP
WITH
SEVERAL
SUBSTITUTES
FOR
YOU
DONT
HEAR
ABOUT
THEM
BECAUSE
THE
MOBILE
AIR
CONDITIONING
SOCIETY
MACS
THAT
IS
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
STAND
TO
RAKE
IN
THAT
TO
PER
RETROFIT
PER
AUTOMOBILE
HAVE
MOUNTED
AN
ORGANIZED
CAMPAIGN
TO
SQUASH
THOSE
SUBSTITUTES
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE
IF
NOT
BAN
THEM
ALTOGETHER
ON
VERY
SHAKY
TECHNICAL
GROUNDS
AT
BEST
ON
OUTRIGHT
LIES
AT
WORST
NOW
IM
NOT
SAYING
YOURE
WRONG
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
SUBSTITUTES
EXIST
BUT
THIS
SOUNDS
A
LOT
LIKE
THE
CARBS
THAT
THE
OIL
COMPANIES
KEEP
US
ALL
FROM
GETTING
IT
SOUNDS
CRAZY
BUT
ITS
TRUE
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
SUBSITUTES
IS
CURRENTLY
A
COMMERCIAL
PRODUCT
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
SAE
COMMITTEE
ON
MOBILE
AIR
CONDITIONING
IS
COMPRISED
ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY
OF

SUCH
BEING

DISCLAIMER

WHY
WOULD
NEC
NEEDS
A
NAME
AGREE
WITH
ANY
OF
THIS
ANYWAY
I
WAS
RAISED
BY
A
PACK
OF
WILD
CORN
DOGS
WE
HERE
ARE
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
INFO
ON
SUBSTITUTES
IN
FACT
I
THINK
WE
REALLY
NEED
ALL
THE
INFO
ON
THIS
WE
CAN
GET

CORRESPONDING
USEFULLNESS
I
AM
CURRENTLY
WORKING
WITH
THE
LOCAL
ENGINEERS
WHO
ARE
MAKING
SURE
WE
ARE
COMPLIANT
WITH
THE
REGULATIONS
THE
TROUBLE
WITH
REGULATIONS
IS
THAT
THEY
ONLY
TELL
YOU
WHAT
YOU
ARE
NO
LONGER
PERMITTED
TO
DO
NOT
WHAT
YOU
SHOULD
DO
INSTEAD
I
THINK
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
NEW
REGULATIONS
IS
THE
MONTREAL
PROTOCOL
WHICH
HAS
A
DEFINITE
CFCPHASEOUT
SCHEDULE
OF
COURSE
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
MONTREAL
PROTOCOL
WAS
ALL
THE
RESEARCH
DONE
ON
THE
CAUSES
OF
THE
OZONE
DEPLETION
PROBLEM
SOMEONE
ASKED
EARLIER
ABOUT
WHY
THE
GOVERNMENTS
WERE
WORKING
SO
FAST
TO
BAN
THE
OZONEDEPLETING
CFC
CHEMICALS
AND
NOT
GASOLINES
AND
OTHER

THE

BY

GASSES
LIKE

METHANE
AND
THE
OZONEHOLE
PROBLEM
PRODUCED
BY
LONGLIVED
CHLORINECONTAINING
MOLECULES
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
THING
IT
IS
A
LOT
EASIER
TO
DO
SOMETHING
ABOUT
NOT
USING
THE
CFCS
CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS
THAN
IT
IS
TO
STOP
PRODUCING
AND
METHANE
WHICH
ARE
NATURAL
BYPRODUCTS
OF

AND
OF
LIVING

ORGANISMS
PLANTING
MORE
TREES
AND
NOT
DESTROYING
SO
MANY
EXISTING

WOULD
HELP

BUT
WOULD
DO
NOTHING
