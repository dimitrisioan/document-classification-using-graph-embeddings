re
advice
on
bmws
and
winter
driving
this
past
winter
i
drove
from
nyc
to
killingtonvt
or
times
in
my
convertible
talk
about
poor
reputation
in
the
snow
with
an
excellent
set
of
snow
tires
i
put
noika
on
in
dec
and
have
been
sure
footed
in
some
pretty
severe
weather
conditions
ever
since
ive
plowed
through
inch
snow
covered
roads
effortlessly
while
other
cars
have
been
paralyzed
front
wheel
drive
included
concentrate
more
on
where
the
rubber
meets
the
road
rather
than
driveability
of
cars
in
snowy
conditions
drive
carefully
buy
good
snow
tires
and
most
cars
will
perform
adequately
in
less
than
ideal
conditions
an
aside
i
cant
praise
noika
snows
enough
absolutely
the
best
snow
tires
i
have
ever
driven
on
if
you
live
in
the
snow
belt
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
set
of
these
next
winter
