oh
really
heres
what
you
posted
earlier
in
another
thread
before
you
thrash
others
for
making
simple
mistakes
or
flaunt
your
wonderful
vi
skill
think
about
how
you
make
them
feel
as
well
as
how
you
look
you
spelled
it
right
for
years
you
have
assaulted
others
with
offensive
language
etc
from
the
content
of
many
of
your
posts
you
appear
to
have
a
lot
of
useful
information
to
share
with
people
but
it
gets
overshadowed

you
come

remember
roads
in
america
are
not
designed
for
speeds
above
meaning
they
would
be
safe
at
roads
like
the
autobahn
are
smoother
straiter
wider
and
slightly
banked
well
thats
news
before
the
speed
limit
on
texas
highways
was
the
speed
limit
on
the
new
jersey
