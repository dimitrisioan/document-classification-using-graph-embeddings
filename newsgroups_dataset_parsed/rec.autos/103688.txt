favoritecarsofalltime
list
where
is
this
place
was
the
car
for
sale
come
on
i
need
detailsor
not
anyways
i
just
had
to
say
wow
at
the
sighting
of
such
a
fine
beast
but
remember
the
mustang
will
forever
be
the
true
king
of
the
road
the
place
was
in
what
used
to
be
a
small
town
now
a
suburb
north
of
atlanta
i
dont
know
if
the
car
was
for
sale
or
not
you
wouldnt
put
a
price
on
the
window
on
this
type
of
car
anyway
damn
straight
as
far
as
ive
heard
unless
the
owner
is
very
hard
up
the
are
not
for
sale
at
any
price
that
mere
mortals
could
afford
and
maybe
the
mustang
will
be
forever
king
of
the
road
the
isnt
road
legal
i
think
the
actually
is
street
legal
although
that
particular
question
is
moot
see
the
price
figures
below
this
car
was
right
hand
drive
werent
they
all
like
that
how
much
does
a
go
for
how
many
were
made
i
wish
i
could
find
my
shelbyamerican
guide
it
included
the
registry
as
of
or
so
there
were
precious
few
of
them
made
fifty
is
the
number
that
springs
to
mind
they
made
just
enough
to
qualify
for
the
manufacturers
cup
or
whichever
series
it
was
that
shelby
broke
ferarris
winning
streak
in
in
and
they
are
all
accounted
for
the
last
price
i
saw
estimated
on
a
was
a
little
bit
over
yes
thats
right
one
million
us
dollars
it
was
second
only
to
some
worthless
piece
of
ferrari
that
it
would
blow
the
doors
off
of
i
dont
recall
offhand
what
the
drive
configuration
was
although
im
certain
some
must
have
been
lhd
as
they
had
to
be
sold
to
qualify
for
racing
the
drivertrain
was
the
ford
hiriser
i
think
andor
sideoiler
coupled
to
various
transmissions

also
used
manuals
