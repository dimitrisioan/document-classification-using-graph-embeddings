i
dont
know
why
you
are
complaining
about
alot
of
us
have
cars
that
can
easily
top
that
most
that
go
are
built
to
do
it
also
and
can
handle
the
speed
why
complain
and
just
join
in
on
the
fast
fun
can
i
ask
have
any
of
you
been
at
the
speed
of
its
a
rush
driving
in
a
straight
line
is
fine
you
very
soon
become
aclimated
to
it
its
only
a
rush
when
there
are
corners
that
you
dont
think
you
can
make
on
a
clear
autobahn
is
nothing
in
the
us
of
people
and
all
judges
would
label
you
insane
and
it
is
difficult
to
persuade
people
otherwise
sure
but
the
surface
condition
of
most
good
autobahns
is
far
better
than
most
of
the
roads
here
a
dip
in
the
asphalt
that
you
test
your
shocks
on
at
will
kill
you
at
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
to
drive
quickly
and
they
say
my
probe
will
do
but
thats
more
than
ive
ever
tried
in
it
cause
there
isnt
a
decent
enough
piece
of
road
hereabouts
