RE
BMW
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
I
LOOKED
AT
THAT
BIMMER
YESTERDAY
ITS
AN
HAS
ABOUT
ACCORDING
TO
OWNER
ODOMETER
STOPPED
WORKING
AT
DRIVESS
WELL
SOUNDS
GOOD
BODY
IS
OK
HE
WANTS
I
LIKED
THE
CAR
DESPITE
ITS
AUTO
TRANNY
BUT
MY
WIFE
WILL
BE
A
PRIMARY
DRIVER
ON
THIS
ONE
AND
SHE
WANTS
AUTO
THE
RADIO
DOES
NOT
WORK
UNTILL
THE
CAR
WARMS
UP
AND
YOU
HONK
THE
HORN
THE
AC
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
A
LEAK
THE
SUNROOF
IS
STICKY
BUT
OPERATIONAL
ODOMETER
DOES
NOT
WORK
AS
MENTIONED
BEFORE
IDLE
IS
A
BIT
BOUNCY
GOING
FROM
TO
WIPERS
ARE
SLOW
THATS
TEH
GRIPES
THE
OWNER
SAYS
THAT
HE
CHANGED
RADIATOR
ALTERNATOR
ROTORS
AND
CALIPERS
EXHAUST
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
OWNER
IS
A
SHIFTY
SOB
TELLING
STRANGE
STORIES
I
HATE
THAT
I
WOULD
NEVER
BUY
FROM
A
PERSOM
LIKE
THAT
EXCEPT
HOW
OFTEN
YOU
SEE
A
DESCENT
FOR
THAT
AMOUNT
OF
MONEY
HE
ALSO
SAID
THAT
ALTHOUGH
I
COULD
BRING
A
MECHANICIN
HE
WOULDNT
LET
ME
CHECK
THE
CAR
BY
TAKING
IT
TO
A
GARAGE
SUSPICIOUS
AND
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
MILAGE
IS
ON
IT
SO
LET
ME
KNOW
WHAT
TO
CHECK
FOR
GIVEN
THERES
PRACTICALLY
NO
RUST
I
KNOW
THERE
WAS
AN
ARTICLE
ON
IN
RD
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
ANYBODY
REMEMBERS
WHAT
ISSUE
MIKES
DONT
BUY
IT
ALL
OF
THE
THINGS
YOU
MENTIONED
WILL
JUST
GIVE
YOU
HEADACHES
LATER
ON
ALSO
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
THE
CAR
NEEDS
A
LOT
OF
WORK
AND
AS
YOU
PROBABLY
KNOW
BMWS
ARE
NOT
CHEAP
TO
FIX
EITHER
THE
OWNER
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
SHADY
CHARACTER
JUST
TRYING
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
SOMEONE
SURE
SOUNDS
GOOD
BUT
YOU
SHOULD
CALCULATE
HOW
MUCH
THE
REPAIRS
WILL
BE
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SINK
IN
AT
LEAST
TO
GET
EVERYTHING
FIXED
IF
NOT
MORE
ALSO
NEVER
TRUST
ANYONE
AS
FAR
AS
MILEAGE
IS
CONCERNED
WHO
KNOWS
HOW
MANY
MILES
ARE
ON
IT
AND
HOW
IT
WAS
DRIVEN
SURE
PEOPLE
TELL
YOU
BMWS
HOLD
UP
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
CONSIDER
ANY
CAR
IS
SUBJECT
TO
WEAR
AND
TEAR
FOR
ALL
YOU
KNOW
IT
COULD
HAVE
MILES
ON
IT
THE
THING
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
IS
THAT
THIS
ISNT
THE
LAST
AROUND
EITHER
JUST
WAIT
AND
KEEP
SHOPPING
FOR
AROUND
YOU
CAN
PROBABLY
FIND
ONE
THAT
IS
BETTER
NEEDS
LESS
REPAIR
AND
HAS
LEGITIMATE
MILEAGE
UNLIKE
THE
ONE
YOU
ARE
CONSIDERING
TAKE
IT
FROM
A
GUY
WHO
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
GOOD
LUCK
AL
HIMSL
