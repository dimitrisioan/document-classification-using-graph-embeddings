WRITES
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
ADVANTAGE
WITH
MANUALS
YOU
CAN
START
THE
CAR
BY
PUSHING
IT
AND
SHIFTING
INTO
SECOND
GEAR
THIS
DOESNT
WORK
WITH
AN
AUTOMATIC
PETER
JUST
FOR
THE
RECORD
READ
YOUR
OWNERS
MANUAL
BEFORE
ATTEMPTING
A
PUSH
START
MOST
MANUFACTURERS
TODAY
DO
NOT
RECOMMEND
THIS
I
THINK
THE
CATALYTIC
CONVERTER
IS
THE
PRIMARY
REASON
UNBURNED
GAS
GOES
DOWN
TO
IT
AND
MAY
IGNITE
WHEN
THE
CONVERTER
GETS
INTO
ITS
OPERATING
RANGE
THE
BEST
REASON
FOR
A
MANUAL
BECAUSE
YOU
LIKE
TO
DRIVE
ONE
I
FIND
THAT
ITS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
DEVELOP
LAZY
HABITS
IN
AN
AUTO
TRANS
CAR
REMEMBER
PAY
ATTENTION
OUT
THERE
STUPIDITY
BEHIND
THE
WHEEL
HAS
STILL
TAKEN
MORE
PEOPLE
TO
THE
MORGUE
THAN
DRUNK
DRIVING
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
WE
DONT
REVOKE
PEOPLES
LICENSE
FOR
STUPIDITY
