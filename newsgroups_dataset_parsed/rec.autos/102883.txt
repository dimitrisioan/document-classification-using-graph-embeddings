yes
i
have
the
same
questions
what
makes
me
upset
is
that
costs
are
skyrocketing
and
in
fact
cant
be
bought
anymore
in
my
area
also
this
is
yet
another
way
mechanics
and
dealers
can
ripoff
customers
also
i
was
reading
that
the
new
refrigerant
is
not
compatible
with
the
system
and
that
it
would
cost
upto
a
to
retrofit
a
car
with
the
old
system
although
it
is
important
to
consider
the
environment
i
think
the
sudden
ban
is
a
slap
in
the
face
for
the
consumer
why
is
it
that
the
consumer
should
have
to
pay
for
the
retrofit
the
auto
companies
should
have
seen
this
coming
also
why
is
it
that
the
governments
of
the
world
were
so
quick
in
banning
freon
use
and
yet
so
slow
in
banning
gasoline
in
my
opinion
gasoline
is
just
as
hazardous
as
anything
else
why
cant
they
start
proposing
bans
on
this
and
switch
to
natural
gas
or
electric
the
technology
is
there
hopefully
some
chemist
will
come
up
with
another
alternative
coolant
that
will
be
compatible
with
the
old
system
al
h
several
chemists
already
have
come
up
with
several
substitutes
for
you
dont
hear
about
them
because
the
mobile
air
conditioning
society
macs
that
is
the
people
who
stand
to
rake
in
that
to
per
retrofit
per
automobile
have
mounted
an
organized
campaign
to
squash
those
substitutes
out
of
existence
if
not
ban
them
altogether
on
very
shaky
technical
grounds
at
best
on
outright
lies
at
worst
does
this
piss
you
off
yes
write
a
letter
to
your
congressman
to
your
senator
to
the
president
to
the
epa
and
to
the
dot
and
complain
later
