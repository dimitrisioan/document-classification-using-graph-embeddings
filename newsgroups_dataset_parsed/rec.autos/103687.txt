LEE
GROVES
WRITES
FROM
ARTICLE
BY
I
HAVE
A
PAIR
OF
SPORT
SEATS
FROM
FOR
SALE
BLUEBLACK
AS
THE
OWNER
OF
AN
AND
HAVING
SEVERAL
FRIENDS
WHO
OWN
THEM
I
AM
VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE
WHEN
I
SEE
AN
AD
LIKE
THIS
I
HAVE
KNOWN
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
LOST
THE
SEATS
FROM
THEIR
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
NIGHT
TO
SUPPORT
THE
CELICA
RETROFIT
TRADE
AND
THE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
MISERABLE
TO
DEAL
WITH
IN
ALL
CASES
WHEN
THESE
SEATS
ARE
SEEN
FOR
SALE
THEY
ARE
MOST
OFTEN
STOLEN
SO
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
SEE
A
STATEMENT
SAYING
WHERE
THEY
CAME
FROM
THAT
WOULD
AT
LEAST
HELP
TO
SOOTHE
THE
REFLEXIVE
FEAR
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
MAKING
A
BUCK
AT
SOMEONE
ELSES
EXPENSE
ILL
GIVE
THIS
SELLER
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
DOUBT
BUT
PEOPLE
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
THE
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
SEATS
ON
THE
MARKETESPECIALLY
THOSE
THAT
ARE
IN
CELICASARE
STOLEN
LEE
BTW
THEY
ARE
INCREDIBLE
SEATS
SO
IF
ITS
LEGIT
GO
FOR
IT
I
AM
THE
ORIGINAL
OWNER
OF
THE
SEATS
AND
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
I
TAKE
VERY
SERIOUS
OFFENCE
IN
YOUR
STATEMENT
I
SEE
A
LOT
OF
COMPUTERS
ADVERTIZED
ON
THE
NET
AND
MY
FRIEND
JUST
HAD
BEEN
RELEIVED
OF
HIS
MACHINE
ALL
THE
NETCOMPUTER
ADS
ARE
FOR
STOLEN
COMPUTERS
WHERE
DID
YOU
LEARN
LOGIC
AS
FOR
THE
SEATS
THEY
WERE
REPLACED
BY
A
MUCH
HARDER
LITERALLY
CELICA
GTS
SEATS
DUE
TO
MY
BACK
PROBLEM
THAT
IS
WHY
I
HAD
TO
REUSE
THE
BRACKETS
AND
THATS
WHY
THE
SEATS
I
SELL
ARE
ATTACHED
TO
CELICA
BRACKETS
PLEASE
IN
THE
FUTURE
THINK
BEFORE
YOU
MAKE
ALLEGATIONS
LIKE
THE
ABOVE
IT
HURTS
MIKES
