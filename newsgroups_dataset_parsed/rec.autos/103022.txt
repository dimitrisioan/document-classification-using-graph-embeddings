sorry
i
cant
help
you
with
your
question
but
i
do
have
a
comment
to
make
concerning
aftermarket
ac
units
i
have
a
frostking
or
frosttemp
forget
which
aftermarket
unit
on
my
cavalier
and
am
quite
unhappy
with
it
the
fan
is
noisy
and
doesnt
put
out
much
air
i
will
never
have
an
aftermarket
ac
installed
in
any
of
my
vehicles
again
i
just
cant
trust
the
quality
and
performance
after
this
experience
les
let
me
add
my
in
i
had
a
ac
installed
by
the
ford
garage
and
it
did
not
work
as
well
as
the
ac
that
was
installed
by
the
factory
in
pickups
identical
to
mine
i
have
talked
to
other
people
that
have
had
the
same
result
dont
know
if
this
is
just
a
probable
with
ford
or
what
ernie
smith
i
agree
never
have
the
dealer
add
anything
to
your
car
if
you
want
ac
make
sure
it
is
factory
installedhondas
maybe
excluded
many
cant
be
bought
with
ac
installed
at
the
factory
but
i
think
maybe
they
actually
use
all
the
needed
parts
for
a
true
factory
install
when
they
put
one
inas
in
bigger
radiator
etcor
are
designed
properly
for
this
in
the
place
anyway
my
point
is
the
dealer
installed
ac
wont
be
anywhere
near
as
good
as
factory
and
the
service
bums
will
mess
up
your
car
when
installing
it
scratches
screwdriver
holes
in
seatsparts
not
reinstalled
correctly
or
with
all
the
screws
etc
i
know
a
guy
who
has
been
service
manager
at
a
gm
dealer
for
yearshe
said
never
have
a
dealer
add
anything
to
your
car
except
maybe
floormats
