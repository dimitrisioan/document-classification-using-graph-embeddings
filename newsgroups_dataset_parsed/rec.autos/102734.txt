WRITES
SO
I
BLOCK
THE
WOULDBE
PASSERS
NOT
ONLY
FOR
MY
OWN
GOOD
BUT
THEIRS
AS
WELL
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
OFTEN
TOO
STUPID
TO
REALIZE
IT
AS
A
RULE
OF
PHILOSOPHY
I
DONT
FEEL
PARTICULARLY
SORRY
WHEN
SOMEBODY
GETS
OFFED
BY
HIS
OWN
STUPIDITY
BUT
IT
DOES
WORRY
ME
WHEN
SOME
IDIOT
IS
IN
A
POSITION
TO
CASH
IN
MY
CHIPS
TOO
HH

APPOINTED
TRAFFIC
COP

YOU
WANT
TO
STICK
THE
NOSE
OF
YOUR

SUPPOSE
ITS
YOUR
NECK
HOWEVER
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
LET
YOU
KILL
ME
IN
THE
BARGAIN
IF
YOU
GET
FRUSTRATED
BY
SOMEBODY
DELAYING
YOUR
INEVITABLE
DEATH
DUE
TO
LESS
THAT
WISE
DRIVING
PRACTICES
THEN
TOUGH
THANK

FOR
THE
