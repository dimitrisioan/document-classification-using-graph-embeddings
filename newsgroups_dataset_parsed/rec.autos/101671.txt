in
your
experience
how
true
is
it
that
a
fuel
injector
cleaning
will
do
much
more
good
than
just
using
detergent
gas
while
i
agree
that
a
clogged
fuel
injector
would
darken
my
day
how
clogged
do
they
get
and
is
a
good
price
or
can
i
do
it
myself
by
buying
a
can
of
what
and
doing
what
a
fuel
injector
cleaning
at
the
dealer
is
probably
little
more
than
them
opening
your
gas
tank
dumping
in
a
bottle
of
fuel
injector
cleaner
and
sending
you
on
your
merry
way
poorer
go
to
kmart
and
buy
the
cleaner
yourself
for
personally
i
wouldnt
use
the
product
from
kmart
i
knew
about
this
previously
but
this
past
weekend
on
pbss
motorweek
pat
goss
their
resident
tech
type
discussed
these
products
and
recommends
not
using
them
ie
the
nonisopropyl
alcohlo
based
injector
cleaners
supposedly
only
the
isopropyl
based
cleaners
actually
remove
moisture
from
your
fuel
tank
as
they
clean
your
injectors
and
although
the
others
ethyl
based
do
clean
injectors
they
also
cause
rubber
components
in
the
fuel
system
to
deteriorate
and
they
dont
mix
well
with
water
to
help
remove
it
from
the
fuel
system
i
use
a
product
recommended
by
vw
called
by
bg
products
inc
it
cost
more
about
but
it
is
supposed
to
do
the
job
without
the
potential
harmful
side
effects
and
its
results
are
supposed
to
last
from
to
miles
i
have
also
used
chevrons
techtrolene
sp
i
cant
say
that
i
have
noticed
any
difference
using
either
since
i
only
use
these
product
as
a
preventative
maintenance
item
just
because
you
dealer
sez
you
need
it
dont
mean
its
necessarily
so
be
suspicious

oo
fahrvergnugen
forever
the
fact
that
i
need
to
explain
it
to
you
indicates
that
you
probably
wouldnt
understand
anyway
