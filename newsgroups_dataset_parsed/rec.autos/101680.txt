IVE
GOT
AN
PLYMOUTH
COLT
THAT
ID
LIKE
TO
DO
A
FRONTEND
ALIGNMENT
ON
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
WITHOUT
ALL
OF
THE
FANCY
SCHMANCY
GADGETS
THE
PROS
HAVE
HOW
STEVE
NONONONO
IF
YOU
DO
SO
YOU
ARE
PUTTING
THE
LIVES
OF
OTHERS
ON
THE
ROAD
AT
CONSIDER
ABLE
RISK
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
MECHANICS
ARE
ASE
CERTIFIED
ANYWAY
YOU
PUT
IT
YOU
NEED
THOSE
FANCY
SCMANCY
GADGETS
AWWW
RIGHT
YOU
WANT
ALL
THE
HOME
MECHANICS
LINED
UP
AGAINST
A
WALL
AND
SHOT
EH
BULL
PUCKY
YOU
CHICKEN
READ
THE
SERVICE
MANUAL
AND
GET
YOUR
HEAD
OUT
OF
THE
SAND
CERTAINLY
THERE
ARE
TOOLS
FOR
THE
JOB
THAT
ARE
CHEAPER
THAN
AN
ALIGNMENT
RACK
THAT
DO
THE
JOB
AS
COMPETENTLY
ALBEIT
NOT
AS
SWIFTLY
IF
NOT
MORE
ACCURATE
DUE
TO
THE
NATURAL
PRIDE
AN
OWNERMECHANIC
PLACES
ON
HIS
WORK
YOU
CAN
DO
AN
ACCEPTABLE
JOB
OF
ALIGNING
A
CAR
USING
SIMPLE
TOOLS
AND
SOME
IMAGINATIVE
WORK
THAT
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
THE
EFFECT
OF
ENDANGERING
ANYONES
LIFE
THE
WORST
THAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
YOUR
TIRES
WEAR
ODDLY
WELL
YOU
COULD
HAVE
THE
WHEELS
AIMING
TOTALLY
PIGEON
TOED
AND
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
STEER
THE
CAR
RAISE
YOUR
HANDS
THOSE
THAT
THINK
THEIR
VISION
IS
SO
POOR
THAT
THEY
WOULD
SCREW
UP
THIS
BADLY
I
BET
YOU
ARE
ONE
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
THAT
FEELS
THAT
HONING
A
CYLINDER
WALL
WITH
SAND
PAPER
WILL
KILL
MILLIONS
OF
PEOPLE
IT
AINT
MAGIC
GO
TAKE
THE
CERTIFICATION
COURSE
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
HAVE
NEVER
LEARNED
TO
ADD
IN
THEIR
WHOLE
LIFE
THAT
ARE
TAKING
THE
CERTIFICATION
BTW
I
AM
DISGUSTED
AT
THE
COLT
AND
SOME
OF
THE
OTHER
CHRYSLER
OFFERINGS
BECAUSE
THEY
GO
OUT
OF
ALIGNMENT
IF
YOU
SNEAZE
AT
THEM
MY
CHRYSLER
LASER
SIMILAR
TO
THE
DAYTONA
A
RESKINNED
COLT
NEEDED
A
REALIGNMENT
EVERY
MONTHS
BOLT
A
GOOD
GRADE
TO
EACH
WHEEL
USING
A
CAREFULLY
WELDED
SPACER
JIG
MEASURE
TOE
IN
ADJUST
TO
MANUFACTURER
SPECS
CAMBER
A
BIT
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
ADJUST
AND
MEASURE
I
USED
A
MICROMETER
TO
MEASURE
THE
SPACE
BETWEEN
THE
RIM
AND
A
FUNKY
BENT
UP
PIPE
THAT
COULD
BE
PLACED
ON
UPPER
AND
LOWER
PORTIONS
OF
THE
RIM
ON
THE
INSIDE
OF
WHEEL
HARD
TO
EXPLAIN
THIS
SAME
TOOL
COULD
BE
USED
INSTEAD
OF
THE
I
HAD
MADE
THESE
TOOLS
UP
RIGHT
AFTER
THE
LAST
ALIGNMENT
DONE
PROFESSIONALLY
SO
I
HAD
A
REFERENCE
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
MIGHT
NOT
CIAO
MARK
