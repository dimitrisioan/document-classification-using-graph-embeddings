COULD
TAKE
A
SCREW
DRIVER
AND
HAMMER

START
PUNCHING
HOLES
IN
VARIOUS
LOCATIONS

SOME
BLACK
SLIPPERY
STUFF
STARTS
POURING
OUT

YOU
WOULD
KNOW
THAT
THE
OIL
DRAIN
PLUG
IS
NEARBY
WITHIN
A
FOOT
OR

ANYWAY
CLOSE
THE
HOLES
WITH
TOILET
PAPER
BEFORE
REFILEING
WITH
OIL

YOU
HAVE
TO
REFILL
THE
ENGINE

OIL

CANT
GET
AN

WHEN
YOU
PUNCH
HOLES
HANGUYEN
