WROTE
WHILE
NOT
EXACTLY
A
SERVICE
INCIDENT
I
HAD
A
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCE
RECENTLY
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
A
NEW
TRUCK
I
HAD
PICKED
OUT
THE
VEHICLE
I
WANTED
AND
AFTER
A
LITTLE
HAGGLING
WE
AGREED
ON
A
PRICE
I
WROTE
THEM
A
CHECK
FOR
THE
DOWN
PAYMENT
PLUS
TAX
AND
LICENSE
AND
TOLD
THEM
ID
BE
BACK
THAT
EVENING
TO
PICK
UP
THE
TRUCK
WHEN
I
RETURNED
I
HAD
TO
WAIT
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
BEFORE
THE
FINANCE
GUY
COULD
GET
TO
ME
WHEN
I
FINALLY
GOT
IN
THERE
EVERYTHING
WENT
SMOOTHLY
UNTIL
HE
STARTED
ADDING
UP
THE
NUMBERS
HE
THEN
DISCOVERED
THAT
THEY
HAD
MISCALCULATED
THE
TAX
LICENSE
BY
ABOUT
HE
THEN
SAID
HE
NEEDED
ANOTHER
FROM
ME
I
SAID
WE
HAD
ALREADY
AGREED
ON
A
PRICE
AND
IT
WAS
THEIR
PROBLEM
I
WASNT
GIVING
THEM
ANY
MORE
MONEY
THE
FINANCE
GUY
THEN
A
SIMILAR
THING
HAPPEND
TO
ME
A
YEAR
AGO
I
BOUGHT
A
USED
FORD
BRONCO
WHICH
HAS
SINCE
BEEN
STOLEN
AND
FEW
WEEKS
AFTER
I
PAID
AND
TOOK
DELIVERY
THEY
SENT
A
LETTER
TELLING
ME
THEY
GOOFED
AND
MISCALCULATED
THE
LICENSE
RENEWAL
BY
AND
THAT
I
NEED
TO
SEND
IN
A
CHECK
TO
AVOID
FURTHER
DELAY
IN
THE
PROCESSING
OF
MY
REGISTRATION
THE
THING
IS
I
HAD
ALREADY
RECEIVED
THE
PINK
SLIP
FROM
THE
DMV
SO
I
IGNORED
IT
I
RECEIVED
ANOTHER
LETTER
AND
THEN
THE
PHONE
CALLS
STARTED
COMING
FIRST
FROM
THE
FINANCE
GUY
AND
THEN
FROM
THE
GENERAL
MANAGER
BOTH
HOUNDING
ME
FOR
THE
EXTRA
MONEY
THEY
LEFT
ME
ALONE
ONCE
I
TOLD
THEM
I
ALREADY
HAD
THE
PAPERWORK
AND
POINTED
OUT
THE
CLAUSE
IN
THE
CONTRACT
THAT
STATED
THAT
THE
FINAL
PRICE
WAS
JUST
THAT
FINAL
AFTERALL
THEY
WOULDNT
BUDGE
IF
I
HAD
TOLD
THEM
I
WANTED
ANOTHER
OFF
AFTER
THE
DEAL
HAD
BEEN
SIGNED
RIGHT
I
TOLD
THEM
NOT
TO
CALL
AGAIN
AND
THAT
I
WOULD
NOT
DO
BUSINESS
WITH
THEM
IN
THE
FUTURE
THEY
DIDNT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THAT
THIS
AFTER
ALL
WAS
A
USED
FORD
AT
A
TOYOTA
DEALERSHIP
I
HAD
A
MUCH
BETTER
EXPERIENCE
BUYING
A
NEW
PATHFINDER
ABOUT
A
MONTH
AGO
IT
CERTAINLY
PAYS
TO
BUY
A
CAR
ON
THE
LAST
SUNDAY
OF
THE
MONTH
IT
WAS
EVEN
RAINING
TOO
SO
THEY
HAD
DONE
VERY
LITTLE
BUSINESS
THAT
WEEKEND
AND
WERE
REALLY
WILLING
TO
DEAL
I
KEPT
TELLING
THEM
I
WOULD
THINK
ABOUT
IT
AND
THEY
KEPT
DROPPING
THE
PRICE
GOT
A
VERY
GOOD
DEAL
AND
SO
FAR
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
PLEASE
