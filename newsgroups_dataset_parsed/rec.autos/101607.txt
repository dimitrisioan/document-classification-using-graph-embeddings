okay
ill
take
their
word
for
it
these
arethe
numbers
i
have
been
stating
in
the
past
messages
it
really
angers
me
that
you
insisted
you
were
right
and
that
you
had
no
clue
what
your
own
car
weighed
why
didnt
you
check
when
i
first
told
you
that
your
figures
were
implausible
i
am
giving
every
chance
to
retract
figures
widely
known
the
mustang
is
rated
at
is
you
have
a
advantage
over
a
mustang
seems
that
the
mustang
is
rated
at
hp
only
because
ford
changed
its
testing
procedures
under
the
older
procedures
it
still
rates
closer
to
hp
that
means
that
the
mustang
has
hp
more
id
like
to
hear
a
better
explanatin
of
how
you
come
to
that
conclusion
from
the
above
data
big
threat
you
are
kod
by
a
civic
acording
to
cd
yeah
sure
in
your
wet
dreams
and
thats
probably
where
you
got
no
sorry
your
wrong
again
you
quoted
the
del
sol
as
doing
in
according
to
cd
interestingly
the
stealth
es
which
is
faster
than
your
rt
does
the
samerun
in
seconds
according
to
cd
kind
of
embarassing
isnt
it
why
didnt
you
check
the
figures
before
posting
it
only
makes
you
look
stupid
when
you
are
caught
out
twice
with
your
own
figures
that
second
for
the
stealth
ill
check
cds
issue
strange
that
you
claim
to
have
that
you
really
should
have
checked
go
ahead
and
check
asshole
youll
realize
what
an
idiot
you
are
for
not
checking
data
beforeposting
car
drive
may
stealth
es
automatic
for
posts
now
youve
been
harping
on
this
may
issue
of
car
driver
without
posting
any
numbers
why
not
because
they
prove
me
right
and
you
aint
got
the
guts
to
admit
it
yeah
thought
so
if
you
insist
i
gave
you
every
chance
to
retract
but
dodge
stealth
es
auto
does
an
wonder
why
you
couldnt
find
it
do
you
realize
that
a
sentra
cd
will
run
a
that
a
sentra
ser
or
saturn
will
run
in
the
dont
you
think
it
is
kind
of
strange
that
your
sports
car
is
so
easily
beaten
a
mustang
which
weights
about
the
same
according
to
your
numbers
has
less
power
and
is
much
quicker
care
to
explain
dont
be
abusive
just
try
and
come
up
with
a
rational
explanation
of
where
those
went
to
its
a
mystery
to
me
the
sentra
ser
really
is
alot
quicker
than
the
fwd
sports
car
you
are
close
to
the
sentrae
go
look
up
the
numbers
in
cd
and
report
please
no
im
going
to
play
your
game
no
way
sentras
are
slow
i
took
a
test
drive
and
it
took
to
go
why
even
the
hyundai
excel
blows
it
doors
i
guess
you
drove
a
speed
and
couldnt
shift
