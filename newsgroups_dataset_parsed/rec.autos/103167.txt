re
mercury
villager
minivan
good
buy
i
have
tested
both
vehicles
identically
equipped
both
for
weeklong
periods
curiously
and
consider
these
are
test
vehicles
i
found
the
mercury
higher
in
build
quality
than
the
nissan
either
choice
is
good
but
beware
that
i
did
not
experience
reasonable
mileage
with
the
average
city
driving
was
with
about
avg
on
the
highway
both
were
optioned
to
the
hilt
the
nissan
had
leather
the
villager
was
in
the
range
and
the
nissan
was
over
bob
