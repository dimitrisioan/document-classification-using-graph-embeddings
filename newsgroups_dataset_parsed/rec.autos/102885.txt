re
changing
oil
by
self
why
crawl
under
the
car
at
all
i
have
a
machine
i
got
for
my
boat
that
pulls
the
oil
out
under
suction
through
the
dip
stick
tube
it
does
an
excellent
job
and
by
moving
the
suction
tube
around
you
can
get
more
old
oil
out
than
by
using
the
drain
plug
i
think
i
paid
at
eb
marine
the
oil
goes
into
a
steel
gal
can
wait
until
it
cools
and
decant
into
your
favorite
device
i
use
soft
drink
bottles
easy
to
take
them
down
to
the
local
oil
recycle
center
forza
