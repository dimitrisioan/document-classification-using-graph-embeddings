PAULRMOUNT
WRITES
IN
YOUR
EXPERIENCE
HOW
TRUE
IS
IT
THAT
A
FUEL
INJECTOR
CLEANING
WILL
DO
MUCH
MORE
GOOD
THAN
JUST
USING
DETERGENT
GAS
WHILE
I
AGREE
THAT
A
CLOGGED
FUEL
INJECTOR
WOULD
DARKEN
MY
DAY
HOW
CLOGGED
DO
THEY
GET
AND
IS
A
GOOD
PRICE
OR
CAN
I
DO
IT
MYSELF
BY
BUYING
A
CAN
OF
WHAT
AND
DOING
WHAT
A
FUEL
INJECTOR
CLEANING
AT
THE
DEALER
IS
PROBABLY
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
THEM
OPENING
YOUR
GAS
TANK
DUMPING
IN
A
BOTTLE
OF
FUEL
INJECTOR
CLEANER
AND
SENDING
YOU
ON
YOUR
MERRY
WAY
POORER
GO
TO
KMART
AND
BUY
THE
CLEANER
YOURSELF
FOR
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
DEALER
SEZ
YOU
NEED
IT
DONT
MEAN
ITS
NECESSARILY
SO
BE
SUSPICIOUS
