WHARFIE
WRITES
COMPARE
EITHER
TO
THE
PORSCHE
AND
YOU
TELL
ME
WHICH
WAS
DESIGNED
OH
RIGHT
ONLY
DOLLAR
CARS
SHOULD
BE
DRIVEN
FAST
THEY
DRIVE
GODDAMN
RABBITS
AT
MPH
IN
EUROPE
PAL
AND
I
RECKON
A
TAURUS
IS
AT
LEAST
AS
CAPABLE
AS
A
RABBIT
MY
WHOLE
POINT
WAS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
CARS
COULDNT
GO
THAT
FAST
BUT
THAT
THEY
SHOULDNT
GO
THAT
FAST
A
FAMILY
SEDAN
DESIGNED
TO
BE
OPERABLE
AT
DOESNT
SUDDENLY
BECOME
OPERABLE
AT
BECAUSE
YOU
ADDED
SOME
PLASTIC
AERO
EFFECTS
SLIGHTLY
WIDER
TIRES
AND
A
MUCH
LARGER
ENGINE
THATS
WHAT
THE
SHO
IS
A
SLIGHTLY
MODIFIED
FAMILY
SEDAN
WITH
A
POWERFUL
ENGINE
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
BOTHER
IMPROVING
THE
BRAKES
THE
MUSTANG
IS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
DEAL
AS
THE
SHO
A
BIG
POWER
PLANT
STUCK
IN
A
MIDSIZE
SEDAN
WITH
ALMOST
NO
OTHER
MODIFICATIONS
I
HAVE
REALLIFE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THE
MUSTANG
IT
HANDLES
LIKE
A
BRICK
EXCEPT
WHEN
YOURE
INVOKING
OVERSTEER
OF
COURSE
SOMETHING
I
PERSONALLY
AVOID
DOING
ON
THE
HIGHWAY
AND
STOPPING
POWER
IS
INADEQUATE
EVEN
FROM
LOTS
OF
ACCELLERATION
BUT
THE
REST
OF
THE
CAR
IS
NOT
UP
TO
PAR
I
PICKED
THE
PORSCHE
EXAMPLE
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
DESIGNED
WITH
SPEED
IN
MIND
IT
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
BE
THE
IT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
MUCH
CHEAPER
OR
ONE
OF
SEVERAL
MERCEDES
OR
AUDI
MODELS
ALL
OF
THESE
CARS
ARE
FAIRLY
EXPENSIVE
BUT
SO
ARE
THE
PARTS
THAT
MAKE
THEM
DRIVABLE
AT
HIGH
SPEED
THIS
SHOULD
BE
ELEMENTARY
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
THINGS
TO
KEEP
IN
MIND
ABOUT
EUROPE
SINCE
YOU
BROUGHT
IT
UP
MY
AUTOBAHN
KNOWLEDGE
IS
ADMITTEDLY
SECONDHAND
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THE
FOLLOWING
TO
BE
TRUE
DRIVERS
ARE
MUCH
BETTER
DISCIPLINED
IN
EUROPE
THAN
THEY
ARE
HERE
THE
ROADS
COMPRISING
THE
AUTOBAHN
ARE
MUCH
BETTER
DESIGNED
THAN
THEY
ARE
HERE
AND
USUALLY
INCLUDE
ANIMAL
FENCES
THIS
MAKES
THEM
FAR
MORE
PREDICTABLE
THAN
MOST
US
HIGHWAYS
NOT
ALL
OF
EUROPE
IS
THE
AUTOBAHN
MOST
PLACES
IN
EUROPE
HAVE
SPEED
LIMITS
THAT
ARENT
OUTOFLINE
WITH
WHAT
WE
USED
TO
HAVE
IN
THE
US
IF
MY
FRIENDS
WERENT
LYING
TO
ME
THEYRE
TYPICALLY
NOT
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
YOU
WONT
FIND
A
LOT
OF
RABBIT
OWNERS
DOING
NEARLY
ON
THE
AUTOBAHN
BUT
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
NO
RESPECT
FOR
THEIR
OWN
LIVES
YOU
CERTAINLY
HAVENT
CONVINCED
ME
