THE
BIG
DISADVANTAGE
OF
AUTOMATICS
IS
THE
HP
THEY
CONSUME
THAT
NEVER
GETS
TO
THE
WHEELS
IN
THIS
RESPECT
THEY
ARE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
TO
A
MANUAL
ONLY
WHEN
THE
TORQUE
CONVERTER
IS
NOT
LOCKED
UP
THERE
ARE
AUTOS
OUT
THERE
WITH
CONVERTER
LOCK
UP
IN
AND
GEARS
DONT
FORGET
THAT
NOW
THAT
NEW
SPEED
MANUAL
TRANNYS
ARE
AVAILABLE
THE
DRIVE
TRAIN
IS
MORE
OPTIMALLY
GEARED
TO
GET
THE
MOST
OUT
OF
THE
ENGINE
RARE
SO
ARE
SPEED
AUTOS
BUT
VERY
REAL
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
BOTH
MANUALS
AND
AUTOMATICS
HAVE
VASTLY
IMPROVED
I
THINK
THAT
AUTOMATICS
HAVE
ADVANCED
FAR
MORE
THAN
MANUALS
ESPECIALLY
IN
SHIFT
INTELLIGENCE
I
SAY
THAT
A
SMART
AUTOMATIC
IS
BETTER
THAN
THE
MAJORITY
OF
DRIVERS
IN
TERMS
OF
BEING
IN
THE
RIGHT
GEAR
AT
THE
RIGHT
TIME
WHICH
TO
ME
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
TORQUE
CONVERTER
LOSSES
I
PREFER
THE
STICK
FOR
FUN
AND
THE
AUTO
FOR
TRAFFIC
WHO
SAYS
YOU
CANT
HAVE
YOUR
CAKE
AND
EAT
IT
TOO
A
WELL
DESIGNED
SHIFTER
WILL
EASILY
FACILITATE
MANUAL
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTS
I
AM
REFERRING
TO
THE
MUCH
COPIED
MERCEDES
JAGGED
GATE
THE
ONLY
DEPARTMENT
WHERE
YOU
LOSE
OUT
IS
IN
THE
NUMBER
OF
RATIOS
AVAILABLE
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
CONVERTER
LOSSES
IF
AYRTON
SENNA
CAN
DRIVE
A
RACECAR
WITH
FULLY
AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION
IT
CANT
BE
HALF
BAD
ELIOT
