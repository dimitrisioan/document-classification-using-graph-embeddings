I
WAS
RECENTLY
THUMBING
THROUGH
THE
LEMONAID
NEW

GUIDE
WHAT
I
FOUND
WAS
A
CAR
WOULD
BE
GIVEN
A
RECOMMENDED
UNDER
THE
PICTURE
WHILE
A
FEW
SENTENCES
LATER
NOTING
HOW
A
DRIVER
AND
PASSENGER
WERE
VIRTUALLY
GUARANTEED
TO
BE
KILLED
IN
A
FRONT

THE

SMALL
CAR
THE

HAS
THE
WORST
CRASH
RATING
OF
ALL
OF
THE
SMALL
CARS
LISTED
THERE
WERE
MANY
SUCH

OF
GREAT

SURVIVE

WONT
BUY
A
SMALL
CAR
LIKE
A
CIVIC
OR
WHATEVER
GREAT
SAFETY

FOR

SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
WOULD
BE
MORE
DEAD
IN
