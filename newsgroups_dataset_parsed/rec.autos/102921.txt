minivan
based
on
viper
running
gear
hmmmm
not
sure
since
no
such
beast
exists
i
can
tell
you
another
though
you
wont
catch
me
dead
in
a
gmc
syclone
or
typhoon
either
bhp
or
not
not

rational
reasons
for
it

avoid
conflicts
with
the
model
then
strip
off
all
the
luxogarbage
let
the
remain
with
the
flared
arches
and
fat
tires
to
go
fight
with
the
maybe
turn
up
the
boost
a
wee
bit
to
bump
bhp
up
to
say
