RE
PENNSYLVANIA
INSURANCE
LIMITED
TORT
OPTION
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
LIMITED
TORT
OPTION
IS
THE
BEST
THING
CASEY
HAS
EVER
DONE
BASICALLY
LIMITED
TORT
MEANS
THAT
YOU
GIVE
UP
YOUR
RIGHT
TO
SUE
FOR
PAIN
AND
SUFFERING
UNLESS
ONE
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
CONDITIONS
IS
MET
YOUR
MEDICAL
BILLS
RESULTING
FROM
THE
ACCIDENT
EXCEED
X
WHERE
X
IS
SOME
NUMBER
LIKE
IM
NOT
SURE
OF
THE
EXACT
NUMBER
THE
ACCIDENT
WAS
CAUSED
BY
A
DRUNK
DRIVER
I
MEAN
THE
OTHER
DRIVER
WAS
DRUNK
YOU
GET
A
GOOD
LAWYER
AND
HAVE
A
GOOD
CASE
BASICALLY
YOU
CAN
APPEAL
TO
REGAIN
YOUR
RIGHT
TO
SUE
BUT
THERES
ALMOST
NO
CHANCE
OF
THIS
EVER
HAPPENING
YOU
ARE
ONLY
GIVING
UP
YOUR
RIGHT
TO
SUE
FOR
PAIN
AND
SUFFERING
YOU
CAN
STILL
SUE
FOR
MEDICAL
COSTS
ACTUAL
DAMAGES
ETC
BY
AGREEING
TO
LIMITED
TORT
YOU
ARE
ESSENTIALLY
GIVING
UP
YOUR
RIGHT
TO
BE
AN
ASSHOLE
WHO
TREATS
EVERY
ACCIDENT
AS
AN
ENTRY
INTO
THE
LITIGATION
LOTTERY
IN
EXCHANGE
YOU
GET
A
SUBSTANTIAL
REDUCTION
IN
YOUR
RATES
I
SAVE
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
HAVE
MANAGED
TO
SCARE
AND
CONFUSE
PEOPLE
SO
MUCH
THAT
ONLY
ABOUT
OF
PENNSYLVANIANS
GO
FOR
LIMITED
TORT
I
GUESS
THATS
OK
IF
MORE
PEOPLE
OPTED
FOR
IT
THE
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
WOULD
BE
PUSHING
HARDER
FOR
REPEAL
