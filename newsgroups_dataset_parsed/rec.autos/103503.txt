comparing

bmws
i
dont
know
about
saabs
but
whenever
there
is
a
long
temr
tset
in
a
magazine
they
always
say
that
tehyre
are
little
annoying
niggles
which
keep
on
occuring
every
so
often
i
wouldnt
expect
that
from
such
a
quality
car
why
doesnt
anything
like
this
ever
happen
on
bmws
maybe
coz
theyre
quality
cars
