TOMMY
SZETO
WRITES
WATER
GRADUALLY
BUILDS
UP
IN
THE
TRUNK
OF
MY
FRIENDS
FORD
PROBE
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
SPARE
AND
SCOOP
OUT
THE
WATER
UNDER
THE
PLYWOODCARPET
COVER
ON
THE
TRUNK
I
WOULD
GUESS
THIS
USUALLY
HAPPENS
AFTER
A
GOOD
THUNDER
STORM
A
FEW
QS
IS
THIS
A
COMMON
PROBLEM
YES
THIS
IS
A
COMMON
PROBLEM
THE
LEAKS
OCCUR
THROUGH
THE
SEAL
OF
THE
TAILLIGHTS
UNFORTUNATELY
FORD
HAS
THIS
WITH
MOST
PROBES
AND
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
RECALL
FOR
IT
VERY
DISSATISFYING
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
WHERE
ARE
THE
DRAIN
HOLES
LOCATED
FOR
THE
HATCH
THERE
IS
NO
DRAIN
HOLES
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
I
USED
A
MARGINE
TUB
TO
DRAIN
IT
REGRETABLY
I
WAITED
THREE
MONTHS
AS
I
WAS
SHORT
CASH
AND
THEY
WOULDNT
FIX
IT
UNDER
WARRANTEE
THEN
I
PAID
DEARLY
AS
IT
MESSED
UP
MY
ELECTRICAL
SYSTEM
INCLUDING
A
BALANCEMOTION
SENSOR
WHICH
IS
LOCATED
NEAR
THE
FUEL
SHUTOFF
IN
THE
TRUNK
THIS
RESULTED
IN
MY
PASSIVE
RESTRAINTS
MALFUNCTIONINGTHEY
WOULD
NOT
RETRACT
SO
I
ENDED
UP
PAYING
ABOUT
TO
HAVE
THE
SENSOR
REPLACED
TO
HAVE
THE
TAIL
LIGHTS
RESEALED
THEY
FIRTS
REPLACED
THE
HATCH
GASKET
WHICH
I
INSISTED
WAS
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
SO
THEY
DID
NOT
CHARGE
ME
FOR
THAT
WHEN
I
PROVED
TO
BE
RIGHT
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
WATER
DAMAGE
TO
THE
COVERS
TO
THE
TRUNKSPARE
COM
PARTMENT
AND
ALGAE
IN
THE
TAILLIGHTS
VERY
ANNOYING
DONT
LET
THE
WATER
PROBLEM
GOGET
IT
FIXED
OR
YOULL
PAY
MORE
LATER
CONSIDERING
HOW
COMMON
A
PROBLEM
IT
IS
I
HOPE
EVERY
ONE
COMPLAINS
TO
FORD
