better
still
years
ago
they
demonstrated
a
cold
air
system
which
only
used
air
it
was
called
a
rovax
the
unit
worked
very
well
the
short
coming
was
the
seal
technology
where
is
it
today
actually
the
company
and
the
product
was
rovac
which
stood
for
rotary
air
conditioningit
used
a
rotary
compressor
with
what
was
effectively
an
airair
heat
exchanger
and
worked
pretty
well
the
negatives
were
mostly
that
it
was
about
less
efficient
than
using
freon
and
noise
problems
from
the
high
velocitypressure
air
all
of
which
were
solved
by
the
time
the
company
went
bankrupt
it
is
still
a
legal
entity
in
florida
but
i
believe
completely
dead
and
theres
a
heck
of
an
opurtunity
to
buy
up
its
patents
and
restart
the
operation

odd
how
as
i
get
older

days
are
longer
but

years
are
shorter
