HELLO
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
TO
TAKE
OUT
THE
BOLT
UNDER
THE
ENGINE
COMPARTMENT
SHOULD
I
TURN
CLOCKWISE
OR
COUNTER
I
TRIED
ANY
KIND
OF
LUBRICANTS
BUT
I
STILL
FAILED
DO
YOU
THINK
I
CAN
USE
A
ELECTRIC
DRILL
CHANGE
TO
A
SUITABLE
BIT
TO
TURN
IT
OUT
IF
I
CAN
SUCCEED
CAN
I
RETIGHTEN
IT
NOT
TOO
TIGHT
IS
IT
SAFE
WITHOUT
OIL
LEAK
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
IN
ADVANCE
WINSON
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
YOU
TAKE
THE
CAR
TO
THE
NEAREST
CHEVRON
DEALER
WITH
YOUR
OWN
OIL
AND
FILTER
ASK
FOR
AN
OIL
CHANGE
IT
WILL
COST
LESS
THAN
WATCH
HIMHER
DO
IT
JUST
FROM
WATCHING
SOMEONE
DO
A
JOB
YOU
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
LEARN
AND
REMEMBER
THE
SEQUENCE
AND
DO
IT
RIGHT
WHEN
YOU
DO
IT
YOURSELF
THE
NEXT
TIME
BESIDES
WHEN
HESHE
LOOSENS
THE
DRAIN
NUT
THE
NEXT
TIME
AROUND
IT
WILL
BE
EASIER
FOR
YOU
IF
IT
IS
STUCK
USE
AN
IMPACT
WRENCH
NOT
TOO
MUCH
FORCE
THOUGH
USE
A
NEW
WASHER
EACH
TIME
YOU
PUT
THE
NUT
BACK
