I
AM
CONSIDERING
BUYING
A
CHEVY
OR
GMC
FULLSIZE
PICKUP
WITH
THE
EXTENDED
CAB
ANY
OPINIONS
ABOUT
THESE
VEHICLES
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
PROBLEMS
DICK
GRADY
SALEM
NH
USA
GRADYWORLDSTDCOM
SO
MANY
NEWSGROUPS
SO
LITTLE
TIME
I
BOUGHT
A
BRAND
NEW
CHEVROLET
HD
EXTENDED
CAB
LAST
MAY
IT
HAS
HAD
MANY
MANY
PROBLEMS
SEE
MY
EARLER
POST
THAT
DESCRIBES
THE
SITUATION
I
WENT
TO
BBB
ARBITRATION
AND
THEY
RULED
THAT
CHEVROLET
MUST
BUY
IT
BACK
FROM
ME
IF
YOU
DO
GET
ONE
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THE
SPEED
MANUAL
WITH
THE
DEEP
LOW
FIRST
GEAR
THEY
HAVE
PUT
THREE
OF
THEM
IN
MY
TRUCK
SO
FAR
AFTER
ABOUT
MILES
OVERDRIVE
EITHER
STARTS
RATTLING
OR
HISSING
LOUDLY
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
FIX
THEM
CHEVROLET
SAYS
THAT
THE
NOISE
IS
A
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
THE
TRANSMISSION
ALSO
IF
YOU
ARE
PLANNING
TO
USE
YOUR
TRUCK
TO
TOW
THE
GEAR
RATIOS
IN
THAT
TRANNY
SUCK
ON
A
STEEP
HILL
YOU
GET
UP
TO
ABOUT
MPH
IN
SECOND
GEAR
AT
RPM
YELLOW
LINE
IF
YOU
SHIFT
TO
THIRD
THE
RPM
DROP
TO
ONLY
AND
YOU
BEGIN
TO
LOOSE
SPEED
I
SHOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
THEY
PUT
IN
THE
HD
GVW
TRUCKS
IS
A
DETUNED
MOTOR
COMPARED
TO
THE
ONE
THEY
PUT
IN
THE
LIGHT
DUTY
ONES
THEY
DROPPED
THE
COMPRESSION
RATIO
SUPPOSEDLY
FOR
ENGINE
LONGEVITY
REASONS
SO
THE
LIGHT
DUTY
MAY
PULL
BETTER
THAN
MY
TRUCK
DOES
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
HAVE
GONE
WRONG
INCLUDE
THE
VENTILATION
FAN
TIMES
SO
FAR
PAINT
HAD
SPECS
OF
RUST
EMBEDDED
IN
THE
PAINT
FROM
BEING
SHIPPED
BY
RAIL
WITH
NO
COVERING
AND
SUSPENSION
PARTS
LINK
BETWEEN
STABILIZER
AND
CONTROL
ARM
FELL
OFF
ANY
COMPANY
CAN
MAKE
A
BAD
INDIVIDUAL
CAR
CHEVROLET
INCLUDED
WHAT
REALLY
BOTHERED
ME
WAS
THE
WAY
THEY
REACTED
THEY
MADE
NO
ATTEMPT
TO
DEAL
WITH
ME
EXCEPT
TO
TELL
ME
TO
TAKE
IT
BACK
TO
THE
DEALER
FOR
THEM
TO
ATTEMPT
TO
FIX
IT
ONE
MORE
TIME
SO
I
BOUGHT
A
BRAND
NEW
FORD
HD
SUPER
CAB
WITH
A
AND
AN
AUTOMATIC
I
WILL
NEVER
BUY
ANOTHER
CHEVROLET
