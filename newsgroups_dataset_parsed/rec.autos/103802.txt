RE
VX
WE
HAVE
SEEN
LOTS
OF
DISCUSSION
ON
AUTOMOBILE
ENGINE
CONFIGURATION
LET
ME
ASK
A
SIMILAR
QUESTION
FROM
THE
AVIATION
FIELD
YOU
MUST
HAVE
SEEN
IMAGES
OF
PROP
PLANES
WITH
ALL
CYLINDERS
EXPOSED
I
HAVE
SEEN
UP
TO
CYLINDERS
POSITIONED
RADIALLY
IN
A
CIRCULAR
FASHION
WITH
THE
PROP
AT
THE
CENTER
OF
THE
CIRCLE
THIS
ARRANGEMENT
ALWAYS
BRINGS
UP
A
GEOMETRIC
DILEMMA
HOW
CAN
ONE
CRANKSHAFT
THROW
ACCOMODATE
RODS
OR
ARE
THE
PISTONS
DISPLACED
BUT
NOT
VISIBLE
FROM
THE
OUTSIDE
BIJAN
