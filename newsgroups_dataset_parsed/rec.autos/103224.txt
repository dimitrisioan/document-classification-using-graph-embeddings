a
good
performance
and
mid
and
high
speeds
can
be
obtained
by
adjusting
the
top
gear
and
final
drive
ratios
contrary
to
popular
misperception
a
number
of
japanese
cars
have
quite
good
performance
from
in
top
gear
no
problem
with
that
the
question
is
do
they
perform
consistently
in
all
conditions
roads
winds
and
curves
at
that
speed
and
do
so
for
hours
on
end
year
after
year
without
giving
the
driver
white
knuckles
from
my
experience
on
the
autobahnsautostrade
a
good
touring
car
can
be
easily
distinguished
by
its
poise
at
the
best
stay
on
cruise
control
at
for
hours
ive
seen
the
typical
boy
racer
in
a
fiat
try
to
keep
up
sure
they
hit
the
century
mark
but
if
the
wind
blows
the
wrong
way
they
change
lanes
and
if
on
an
overpass
they
may
fly
right
into
a
guardrail
the
buffeting
at
can
be
severe
enough
to
make
the
hood
bend
tires
at
can
melt
and
a
pothole
can
kill
many
german
cars
are
designed
for
this
environment
even
if
they
cant
seem
to
get
out
of
their
own
way
from
a
stop
light
mercedes
come
to
mind
in
particular
and
another
design
point
is
fuel
economy
at
those
speeds
the
germans
gear
the
car
for
very
good
high
speed
efficiency
a
typical
mb
turns
at
almost
a
stall
good
point
i
have
no
idea
how
either
of
my
hondas
will
handle
at
mph
nor
do
they
reach
however
using
high
to
be
mph
a
they
are
quite
amenable
to
long
high
speed
drives
ive
done
several
mile
trips
in
my
civic
with
no
problems
whatsoever
the
last
big
trip
i
made
was
driving
from
new
york
to
texas
i
remember
driving
miles
a
day
at
typically
mph
without
any
problems
im
sure
i
would
have
been
more
comfortable
driving
a
benz
but
no
white
knuckles
no
problems
with
winds
and
curves
then
there
was
the
trip
back
from
new
orleans
after
mardi
gras
where
we
were
doing
all
the
way
to
houston
no
problems
b
both
my
cars
have
surprising
good
fuel
economy
at
high
speeds
i
see
no
difference
between
sustained
mph
and
sustained
on
the
trip
back
from
new
orleans
we
got
about
mpg
in
my
integra
quite
ok
mind
you
the
engine
revs
to
almost
at
the
civic
is
markedly
better
than
the
integra
in
fuel
economy
miles
down
the
road
i
still
get
mpg
at
mph
driving
b
i
cant
understand
why
these
highscale
european
marquees
are
afraid
to
design
engines
that
can
be
repeatedly
revved
to
near
redline
in
the
low
gears
i
have
been
doing
that
for
that
last
miles
with
my
lowly
civic
with
no
detriment
to
either
the
engine
or
the
clutch
and
getting
excellent
mpg
to
boot
id
call
this
an
engineering
hack
to
cover
up
design
deficiencies
at
miles
youd
still
be
breakingin
a
highscale
european
marquee
they
typically
are
designed
to
last
miles
per
engine
mi
per
chassis
the
record
is
now
over
miles
on
a
benz
diesel
and
ive
read
about
transmissions
lasting
miles
speaking
of
now
now
you
cant
compare
a
diesel
with
a
gasoline
engine
i
see
enough
bmws
and
gasoline
mercs
for
sale
that
have
miles
on
them
and
advertise
rebuilt
engines
if
honda
was
to
build
an
accord
for
id
darn
well
expect
the
sucker
to
last
miles
diesels
they
have
very
good
efficiency
at
the
cost
of
acceleration
and
are
very
popular
in
all
european
cars
diesel
is
considered
the
green
fuel
from
the
smallest
econoboxes
to
the
luxobarges
again
we
see
a
difference
in
mentality
diesels
in
the
us
are
considered
slightly
worse
than
useless
and
extremely
dirty
to
boot
so
you
cant
give
them
away
ever
got
caught
behind
a
early
at
a
stop
light
its
not
pleasant
the
newer
mbs
are
a
lot
better
though
the
diesel
volvos
and
vws
are
probably
the
smelliest
offenders
as
for
economy
why
should
we
care
gas
is
cheap
i
personally
wouldnt
buy
a
diesel
car
for
any
reason
what
does
it
buy
