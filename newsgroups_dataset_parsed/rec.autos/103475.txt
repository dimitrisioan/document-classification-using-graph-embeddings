CARRYING

COMPARTMENT
IS
CONSIDERED
CARRYING

WEAPONS
PERMIT
UNLESS
THE
LAW
HAS
BEEN
CHANGED
RECENTLY
CARRYING

OPENLY
IS
LEGAL
IN

CONCEALING

ILLEGAL
I
READ
A
NEWSPAPER
ACCOUNT
LAST
YEAR
WHERE
POLICE
STOPPED
A
CAR
ON
A
TRAFFIC
INFRACTION
AND
OBSERVED
A
MAGNUM
REVOLVER
SITTING
ON
THE
SEAT
THE
DRIVER
COULD
NOT
BE
CITED
FOR
POSSESSING
OR
CARRYING
THE
WEAPON
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
NOT
CONCEALED
THE
ARTICLE
STATED
THAT
IF
THE
GUN
HAD
BEEN
DISCOVERED
IN
THE
GLOVE
BOX
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONSIDERED
A
CRIME
KEN
FRANKLIN
THEY
SAY
THERES

SOME
SAY

I
SAY

AINT
GWRRA
ID
RATHER
LAUGH
WITH
THE
SINNERS
THAN
CRY
WITH

SINNERS
ARE
LOTS
MORE
FUN

ONLY
THE
GOOD
DIE
YOUNG
