a

writes
nice
theory
too
bad
the
never
came
with
a
four
cylinder
over
liters
more
like
or
did
they
were
the
nonturbo
or
some
such
foot
in
mouth
again
drew
the
first
generation
mr
were
which
were
very
smooth
id
be
real
surprised
if
the
original
poster
was
talking
about
a
generation
car
the
second
generation
cars
were
for
the
non
turbo
and
for
the
turbo
i
drove
the
non
turbo
and
calling
it
unpleasant
is
to
be
kind
to
it
i
also
understand
that
anyone
using
balancing
shafts
on
four
cylinders
must
pay
saab
a
royalty
for
using
their
patented
designlike
porsches
wrong
and
wrong
mitsubishi
owns
the
patent
which
has
since
expired
which
is
why
everybody
with
a
shred
of
integrity
is
putting
balance
shafts
into
their
big
the
notable
exception
is
nissan
and
only
for
the
us
market
suckers
i
guess
we
need
to
write
to
cd
and
start
telling
them
to
publish
graphs
for
engine
vibration
over
rpm
then
youll
see
usenet
discussions
of
the
form
engine
a
has
peak
vibrations
db
less
than
engine
b
therefore
engine
a
is
better
than
engine
