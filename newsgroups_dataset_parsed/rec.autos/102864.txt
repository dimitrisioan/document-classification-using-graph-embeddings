LH
WORKMANSHIP
I
JUST
VISITED
THE
NY
AUTO
SHOW
AND
SAW
TWO
LH
CARS
ON
THE
FLOOR
EAGLE
VISION
AND
DODGE
INTREPID
REALLY
NICE
I
MUST
SAY
VERY
ATTRACTIVE
STYLING
LOTS
OF
FEATURES
AND
ROOM
AT
A
COMPETITIVE
PRICE
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
WORKMANSHIP
IS
QUITE
DISAPPOINTING
ON
BOTH
CARS
THE
RUBBER
SEALS
AROUND
THE
WINDOW
AND
DOOR
FELL
OFF
IT
TURNS
OUT
THE
SEALS
ARE
JUST
BIG
GROOVED
RUBBER
BAND
IT
GOES
ON
JUST
BY
PRESSING
THE
GROOVE
AGAINST
THE
TONGUE
ON
THE
DOOR
FRAME
SURELY
IT
WOULD
COME
OFF
EASILY
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
MANY
OF
THIS
KIND
OF
POORING
ENGINEERINGASSEMBLY
PROBLEMS
THAT
WILL
SHOW
UP
LATER
I
MAY
STILL
CONSIDER
BUYING
IT
BUT
ONLY
WHEN
IT
ESTABLISHES
A
GOOD
TRACK
RECORD
