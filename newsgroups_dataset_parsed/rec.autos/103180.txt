advice
on
saturn
extended
warranty
i
placed
an
order
for
a
saturn
and
it
is
expected
next
week
the
saturn
retailer
gave
me
some
pamphlets
about
the
extended
warranty
plan
and
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
being
a
first
time
new
car
buyer
i
am
seeking
advice
from
veterans
esp
those
who
have
bought
saturns
lately
fyi
i
have
listed
some
of
the
features
of
the
saturn
extended
warranty
plan
the
car
comes
with
a
mile
bumpertobumper
warranty
plan
i
extended
powertrain
coverage
covers
the
cost
of
repairs
to
engine
transaxle
front
wheel
drive
hour
roadside
assistance
program
coverage
term
yearsmiles
deductible
i
say
extended
warranties
are
a
ripoff
highprofit
item
for
dealers
but
what
i
really
want
to
point
out
here
is
that
you
are
not
buying
you
get
free
so
what
you
are
buying
is
keep
that
in
mind
when
you
look
at
the
cost
vs
coverage
another
point
is
that
many
car
companies
routinely
fix
car
problems
that
are
out
of
warrantywhy
designmanufacturing
defects
that
the
company
owns
up
to
keeping
customer
happy
etc
