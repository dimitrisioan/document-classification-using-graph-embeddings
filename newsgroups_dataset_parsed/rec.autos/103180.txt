I
PLACED
AN
ORDER
FOR
A
SATURN
AND
IT
IS
EXPECTED
NEXT
WEEK
THE
SATURN
RETAILER
GAVE
ME
SOME
PAMPHLETS
ABOUT
THE
EXTENDED

PLAN
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
THINKING
ABOUT
IT
BEING

I
AM

FOR

BUT
WHAT
I
REALLY
WANT
TO
POINT
OUT
HERE
IS
THAT
YOU
ARE
NOT

YOU
GET

SO
WHAT
YOU
ARE
BUYING
IS
KEEP
THAT
IN
MIND
WHEN
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE

ANOTHER

IS
THAT
