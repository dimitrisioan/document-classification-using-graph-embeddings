MY
DAY
IN
COURT
RESULTS
A
WHILE
BACK
I
ASKED
FOR
HELP
IN
DEFENDING
A
TRAFFIC
TICKET
I
RECEIVED
IN
SHORT
THE
TICKET
WAS
FOR
NOT
STOPPING
AT
A
STOP
SIGN
GIVEN
THE
CONDITIONS
I
COULD
NOT
STOP
IN
TIME
AND
DECIDED
INSTEAD
OF
SLIDING
RIGHT
THROUGH
THE
INTERSECTION
I
WOULD
COMPLETE
MY
RIGHTTURN
AND
AVOID
A
POSSIBLE
ACCIDENT
A
POLICE
CRUISER
HAPPENED
TO
BE
APPROACHING
THE
INTERSECTION
FROM
MY
LEFT
AND
GAVE
ME
THE
TICKET
THE
OFFICER
SAID
THE
ONLY
REASON
THAT
YOU
EVEN
SLOWED
DOWN
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
WAS
THAT
YOU
SAW
ME
APPROACHING
OTHERWISE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
BOMBED
RIGHT
THROUGH
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
THANK
ALL
THOSE
WHO
RESPONDED
FAVORABLY
TO
MY
REQUEST
FOR
HELP
TO
ALL
OF
THOSE
WHO
TOLD
ME
TO
BITE
THE
BULLET
AND
PAY
THE
FINE
PHGHGHGHGH
THE
JUDGE
SIDED
WITH
ME
AND
DECIDED
THAT
IN
THIS
CASE
NOT
STOPPING
WAS
THE
SAFEST
THING
TO
DO
AND
FOUND
ME
NOT
GUILTY
THE
OFFICERS
STATEMENT
AND
MY
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
CONDITIONS
AT
THE
TIME
VERY
SLIPPERY
BACKED
BY
NEWPAPER
WEATHER
CONDITIONS
WERE
THE
FACTORS
WHAT
MADE
THE
JUDGE
DECIDE
ON
HIS
VERDICT
MORAL
IF
YOU
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
TO
COURT
BEFORE
AND
YOU
THINK
YOU
HAVE
A
CASE
GO
FOR
IT

A
VERY
INTERESTING
