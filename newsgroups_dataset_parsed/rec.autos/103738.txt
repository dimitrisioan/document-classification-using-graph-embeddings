i
went
to
all
tune
and
lube
for
routine
maintenance
and
they
said
i
need
to
change
plug
wires
because
they
are
original
ones
and
you
driven
k
miles
on
them
i
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
they
just
wanted
to
make
money
wires
had
no
visible
defects
and
my
repair
manual
doesnt
recommend
any
scheduled
maintenance
for
them
is
it
plain
vanilla
rip
off
or
there
can
be
some
backing
behind
their
suggestion
to
replace
wires
