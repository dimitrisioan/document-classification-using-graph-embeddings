my
sister
has
an
mgb
she
has
one
from
the
last
year
they
were
produced
its
in
very
good
shape
ive
been
bugging
her
for
years
last
year
produced
about
selling
it
ive
said
over
and
over
that
she
should
sell
it
before
the
car
is
worthless
while
she
maintains
that
the
car
may
actually
be
increasing
in
value
as
a
result
of
its
limited
availability
which
one
of
us
is
right
are
there
mgb
affectionados
out
there
who
are
still
willing
to
pay
to
for
an
old
mg
are
there
a
lot
out
in
the
market
yes
there
are
still
alot
of
mgbs
out
there
the
earlier
cars
pre
are
usually
more
desirable
due
to
certain
things
that
went
with
having
chrome
bumpers
ride
height
generally
more
power
the
older
cars
are
appreciating
slowly
the
newer
ones
seem
to
be
at
a
stable
level
at
the
moment
to
would
require
extremely
good
condition
and
low
miles
if
the
car
is
in
good
shape
and
regular
maintenance
is
kept
up
on
it
the
car
should
last
for
a
long
time
there
are
still
plenty
of
parts
sources
ouththere
the
mgb
is
a
great
fun
little
car
if
she
is
keeping
it
solely
in
the
hopes
that
it
is
going
to
appreciate
tell
her
to
sell
it
it
is
not
worth
waiting
the
time
it
would
take
to
appreciate
to
a
real
profitable
level
