after
too
many
years
of
school
im
finally
graduating
and
getting
a
real
job
of
course
i
am
trying
to
make
plans
of
how
to
spend
all
this
extra
money
right
now
i
have
an
accord
a
good
car
but
not
real
sporty
i
was
thinking
of
selling
it
in
about
two
years
and
dropping
around
on
a
sports
car
of
some
kind
after
thinking
about
it
i
may
have
a
better
idea
ill
keep
the
accord
until
it
drops
and
buy
the
car
ive
always
wanted
a
corvette
stingray
my
reasoning
is
that
accord
corvette
is
less
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basically
im
thinking
of
a
late
early
for
around
my
question
is
what
are
good
years
to
consider
for
reliability
looks
horsepower
in
that
order
believe
it
or
not
horsepower
is
not
a
main
concern
if
i
want
to
go
fast
i
get
on
my
motorcycle
and
what
are
good
prices
to
vettes
had
the
same
basic
chassis
add
aluminum
weaker
rear
axle
housing
all
these
years
used
same
brakes
similar
springs
etc
late
was
a
bad
year
for
gm
reliability
catastrophic
converter
was
added
in
cheapest
corvette
to
low
end
about
tops
out
about
except
for
those
morooons
that
think
there
indy
aniversity
vette
is
special
these
guys
have
been
known
to
ask
i
dont
think
they
get
it
best
buy
convertables
i
got
my
for
needs
body
work
but
im
willing
parts
for
all
are
readily
avail
at
swap
meets
and
mail
order
etc
reliability
looks
independant
suspension
wheel
disk
and
all
under
and
they
thought
a
miata
was
a
good
deal
also
what
would
insurance
look
like
im
male
single
i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the
car
lower
insurance
would
the
fact
that
i
mainly
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rarely
driven
insurance
class
for
driving
it
under
miles
per
year
my
dad
has
a
vette
and
its
on
what
you
say
classic
insurance
basically
what
that
means
is
that
it
has
restricted
amount
of
driving
time
which
basically
means
it
cant
be
used
as
an
every
day
car
and
would
probably
suit
your
needs
for
limited
mileage
my
origional
inquires
to
my
insurance
agent
i
can
drive
my
convertable
for
miles
or
less
per
year
i
must
keep
it
in
a
locked
garage
and
it
will
cost
me
of
the
stated
value
per
year
does
this
sound
right
ive
also
been
looking
at
vettes
recently
and
found
a
convertible
that
i
like
at
a
dealer
i
currently
own
an
ford
escort
gt
which
is
insured
through
state
farm
i
called
em
up
and
asked
about
the
rates
if
i
sell
the
escort
the
vette
insurance
is
per
months
if
i
keep
the
escort
the
vette
insurance
is
per
months
the
escorts
insurance
goes
down
by
to
approx
per
months
im
male
and
have
a
good
driver
discount
another
variable
would
be
where
you
live
best
bet
is
to
just
call
up
some
insurance
brokers
and
get
a
quote
state
farm
says
they
base
the
price
on
the
fair
market
value
of
the
car
which
is
determined
by
an
outside
apprasier
they
look
in
the
newspaper
and
call
up
dealers
to
find
out
what
the
going
rate
is
and
adjust
it
for
the
condition
of
the
car
to
get
the
values
above
they
went
on
the
selling
price
of
the
car
the
dealers
asking
price
is
i
need
to
do
research
to
find
out
if
this
is
reasonable
in
any
case
i
told
state
farm
the
value
was
get
an
appraiser
to
look
at
the
car
he
will
check
serial
numbers
and
look
for
origional
equipe
depending
on
what
mods
have
been
done
the
car
could
be
worth
only
problems
like
wrong
engine
trans
wrong
paint
type
vetts
used
lacquer
an
modification
would
reduce
tthe
value
but
your
looking
for
a
car
to
drive
right
this
sounds
like
a
ball
park
price
for
a
smallblock
cu
in
manual
no
air
car
a
would
put
it
closer
to
get
it
appraised
for
insurance
purposes
also
