RE
BEST
RADAR
DETECTOR
FROM
ARTICLE
BY
TROYSEQUENTCOM
TROY
WECKER
EARLIER
I
COMMENTED
ON
THE
AND
JIMFCENTERLINECOM
REPLIED
ABOUT
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
UNITS
BOGEY
COUNTER
I
DIDNT
REALLY
GO
INTO
WHY
I
CALLED
THIS
FEATURE
A
GIMMICK
SO
HERE
IS
MORE
EXPLANATION
THANKS
JIM
FOR
THE
GOOD
COMMENTS
AND
OPINION
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
CAN
ONLY
TELL
IF
THESE
MICROWAVES
ARE
COMING
FROM
THE
FRONT
REAR
OR
BOTH
THERE
ARE
ONLY
TWO
ANTENNAS
IF
THEY
ARE
COMING
FROM
BOTH
THIS
IN
INTERPRETED
AS
A
SIDE
BOGEY
BOGEY
COUNTS
ARE
DETERMINED
AS
SOURCES
BY
THEIR
RELATIVE
STRENGTH
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
EVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
REFLECTIONS
OF
THE
SAME
SOURCE
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOUR
ANALYSIS
IS
BASED
ON
HYPOTHESIS
AND
NOT
ACTUALLY
USING
THE
ID
LIKE
TO
GIVE
SOME
FEEDBACK
BASED
ON
REAL
LIFE
EXPERINCE
I
KEEP
THE
IN
ADVANCED
LOGIC
MODE
AND
IT
RARELY
LIGHTS
UP
AS
A
CHRISTMAS
TREE
THE
ONLY
TIME
IT
DOES
IS
WHEN
I
AM
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
MAJOR
SHOPPING
AREA
AND
THEN
IT
MAKES
SENSE
THAT
IS
DOES
SINCE
THERE
ARE
SOURCES
COMING
FROM
MANY
DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS
I
HAVE
FOUND
THE
TO
BE
CONSISTENT
IN
ITS
REPORTING
OF
BOGEYS
REGARDLESS
OF
ANY
MOVING
CARS
IN
THE
AREA
I
HAVE
FOUND
THE
DIRECTIONAL
INDICATION
TO
BE
VERY
USEFUL
IN
ONE
CASE
THERE
WAS
TWO
RADAR
TRAPS
SET
UP
WITHIN
ONE
MILE
OF
EACH
OTHER
AS
I
PASSED
THE
FIRST
RADAR
TRAP
THE
DIRECTION
INDICATION
CHANGED
THEN
THE
DETECTOR
WAS
SET
OFF
AGAIN
POINTING
IN
THE
FORWARD
DIRECTION
WITH
OTHER
RADAR
DETECTORS
I
WOULD
HAVE
ASSUMED
THAT
THIS
WAS
DUE
TO
A
REFLECTION
BUT
WITH
THE
I
KNEW
THERE
WAS
A
HIGH
PROBABILITY
THAT
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
TRAP
AND
THERE
WAS
ON
OTHER
OCCASIONS
THE
DIRECTIONAL
HELPED
DISCERN
A
FALSE
ALARM
FROM
A
TRUE
ALARM
FOR
EXAMPLE
AS
I
PASS
A
SOURCE
THE
DIRECTION
INDICATOR
CHANGES
THE
DIRECTIONAL
ALSO
ALLOWS
ME
TO
FOCUS
MY
ATTENTION
AS
TO
WHERE
THE
SIGNAL
MIGHT
BE
COMING
FROM
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
TO
LOOK
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
WHEN
A
CAR
IS
APPROACHING
ME
FROM
THE
REAR
WITH
A
DETECTOR
THAT
LEAKS
I
CAN
TELL
THAT
THE
SIGNAL
IS
COMING
FROM
THE
REAR
AND
AS
THE
CAR
PASSES
ME
I
CAN
VERIFY
THE
SOURCE
WITH
OTHER
DETECTORS
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
UNABLE
TO
DO
THIS
AND
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
RADAR
TRAP
WHEN
THERE
WAS
NONE
IVE
HAD
THE
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
NOW
AND
FIND
ITS
ADDED
FEATURES
TO
BE
USEFUL
AND
NOT
GIMMICKS
