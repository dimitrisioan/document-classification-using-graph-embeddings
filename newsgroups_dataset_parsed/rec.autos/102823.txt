I
JUST
STARTED
READING
THIS
THREAD
TODAY
SO
FORGIVE
ME
IF
IT
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
MENTIONED
BUTWHAT
WAS
THE
DEAL
WITH
RENAULTS
PUTTING
THE
HORN
ON
THE
LEFTHAND
TURNSIGNAL
STALK
IT
WAS
A
BUTTON
ON
THE
END
WHERE
THE
WASHER
BUTTON
WOULD
BE
ON
THE
WIPERWASHER
STALK
COULD
THE
FRENCHIES
NOT
FIGURE
OUT
THE
WIRING
THROUGH
THE
STEERING
WHEEL
OR
WHAT
FORD
TRIED
THAT
ALSO
BACK
IN
MY
RANGER
PICKUP
HAD
THE
HORN
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TURNSIGNAL
STALK
INSTEAD
OF
IN
THE
CENTER

GOD
INTENDED
IT
TO
BE

DROVE
TWO
DIFFERENT
CARS

THE
OTHER
AN
CAMRY
AND
NEVER
DID
GET
USED
TO
PUSHING
THE
TURNSIGNAL
STALK
TO
BLOW
THE
HORN
THE
ONLY
TIME
I
GOT
IT
RIGHT
WAS
WHEN
I
WAS
GETTING
THE
