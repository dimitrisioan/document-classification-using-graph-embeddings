LEXUS
AND
INFINITI
FROM
FIRST
OFF
THE
CORRECT
SPELLING
OF
NISSANS
LUXURY
AUTOMOBILE
DIVISION
IS
INFINITI
NOT
INFINITY
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
CLEAR
UP
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
KIND
OF
ENGINES
POWER
LEXUS
AND
INFINITI
AUTOMOBILES
SINCE
A
PERSON
HAD
REMARKED
IN
EARLIER
POSTS
THAT
MOST
LEXUS
AND
INFINITI
MODELS
HAD
ENGINES
WHILE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
SAYING
THAT
SEVERAL
OF
EACH
MANUFACTURER
USED
ENGINES
LEXUS
INFINITI
INLINE
I
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
I
CANNOT
REMEBER
FOR
SURE
HERE
I
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
BSB
