lexus
and
infiniti
from
first
off
the
correct
spelling
of
nissans
luxury
automobile
division
is
infiniti
not
infinity
i
would
also
like
to
clear
up
the
question
of
what
kind
of
engines
power
lexus
and
infiniti
automobiles
since
a
person
had
remarked
in
earlier
posts
that
most
lexus
and
infiniti
models
had
engines
while
at
the
same
time
saying
that
several
of
each
manufacturer
used
engines
lexus
infiniti
inline
i
must
admit
that
i
cannot
remeber
for
sure
here
i
hope
this
helps
bsb
