this
isnt
anything
new
back
in
i
was
driving
under
a
high
overpass
at
night
on
in
san
diego
when
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
someone
on
the
overpass
as
i
passed
under
a
rock
slammed
against
the
metal
between
the
winshield
and
right
front
window
my
girlfriend
was
in
the
seat
next
to
it
i
called
the
police
from
the
next
exit
but
i
doubt
if
they
were
found
about
five
years
ago
in
san
diego
someone
was
put
into
a
coma
from
a
brick
being
thrown
through
his
sunroof
as
he
was
driving
and
subsequently
crashed
i
dont
think
he
ever
came
out
of
the
coma
and
i
havent
heard
anything
about
it
for
a
couple
years
i
know
that
this
isnt
the
group
for
it
but
since
you
brought
it
up
does
anyone
have
any
idea
why
they
havent
bombed
the
waco
cult
probably
because
there
are
many
children
there
also
the
minor
fact
that
other
than
defending
themselves
from
some
people
attacking
them
they
havent
threatened
or
attacked
anyone
outside
the
compound
in
years
being
a
promiscuous
religious
nut
does
not
constitute
grounds
for
a
mass
murder
of
koresh
and
his
followers
sorry
for
posting
this
to
this
group
but
i
thought
the
previous
post
needed
a
rebuttal
if
you
followup
to
this
portion
please
crosspost
and
direct
followups
to
a
more
appropriate
newsgroup
