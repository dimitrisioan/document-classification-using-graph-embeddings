MANY
SAY
THAT

OTHERS
FOR

PIRELLI

NOKIA
WILL
VOID

IF
SUCH
SWAPPING

THE
BEST
ADVICE
IS
TO
READ
YOUR
TIRE
MANUAL
CAREFULLY
BEFORE
ROTATING
YOUR
TIRES
AND
STICK
TO
THE
MANUFACTURERS
RECOMMENDATIONS
Q
HOW
MANY
SNOW

SHOULD
I
BUY
AND
IF
I
BUY
WHICH
END
OF
THE

SHOULD
I
PUT
THEM
ON

BOTH

TO
EXPLAIN
MANY

IN

THAT
DONT
GET

WHO
DONT
DRIVE
AGRESSIVELY
OR
AT
ALL
IN

CONDITIONS
GET
AWAY
WITH
ONLY
TWO

WHEELS
BUT
THERE
ARE
CIRCUMSTANCES
WHERE
THIS
CAN
BE
DANGEROUS
PRACTICE
WITH
A
REAR
WHEEL
DRIVE
CAR
YOU
CAN
CHOOSE
BETWEEN
BEING
ABLE
TO
START
THE

OR
STOPPING

OF
THE

IN
A

YOU
START
STOP
AND
TURN
WITH
THE

END
THE
PRIMARY
RISK
OF
PUTTING
THE

TIRES
ON
THE

ONLY
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
HAVE
TO
PUT
ON

THERE

THAT
SOME

ARE
SO

THIS
REALLY
A

IT

OF

THE

NOT

IN
CASES

OTHERWISE
MODERN
DISC
BRAKES
ARE
MORE
THAN
ADEQUATE

MANY
STANDARD

LICENSE

IN

STILL
SPECIFY
THAT
THE

BEING

DOWNSHIFT

I
SUGGEST
THAT
BEFORE
TAKING
A
US
DRIVERS
TEST
YOU
EITHER
LEARN
TO
DO
THIS
SMOOTHLY
WHICH
TAKES
SOME
TIME
AND
PRACTICE
OR
BORROW
A
CAR
WITH
AN
AUTOMATIC
TO
TAKE
THE
TEST

HOW
OFTEN
SHOULD
I
REPLACE
MY

FLUID
A
PROBABLY
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
YOU
DO
TRADITIONAL

SYSTEM
AND
ALSO
LOWER
THE
BOILING
POINT
OF
THE
FLUID
TYPE
ARE
OLDER
FLUIDS
AND
ARE
NEWER
SPECIFICATIONS
THE
PRINCIPAL
DIFFERENCES
ARE
IN
WET
AND
DRY
BOILING
POINTS
THE
DRY
BOILING
POINT
IS
IMPORTANT
IN
FRESH
BRAKE
FLUID
BUT
THE
WET
BOILING
POINT
IS
IMPORTANT
IN
OLDER
BRAKE
FLUID
FLUIDS
HAVE
THE
LOWEST
WET

DRY
BOILING

REQUIREMENTS
FLUIDS
HAVE
BETTER
BOILING

THERE
MAY
BE

ALTHOUGH

MAY

MORE
FREQUENTLY

AT

BLEEDING
A

OUT
OF
THE

CALIPERS
FAIRLY
REGULARLY
Q
WHAT
ABOUT
BRAKE
FLUIDS
A
THIS
BREAKS
DOWN
IN
TO
TWO
PARTS
THE
SPECIFICATION
LOOKS
EXCELLENT
FOR
PERFORMANCE
BUT
THE
FIRST
FLUIDS
WERE
SILICONE
BASED
SILICONE
FLUIDS
ARE
A
TRICKY
PROPOSITION
UNLIKE
AND
FLUIDS
THEY
DO
NOT
ABSORB
WATER
AT
ALL
WHILE
THIS
MAY
SOUND
LIKE
A
FEATURE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ANY
WATER
PRESENT
POOLS
UP
IN
SUCH
SYSTEMS
INTERFERING
WITH
BRAKING
PERFORMANCE
AND
CORRODING
ANY
METALS
AT
THE
SPOT
WHERE
THE
POOLING
IS
OCCURING
THE
WATER
WILL
TEND
TO
MIGRATE
DOWNWARDS
IN
THE
BRAKING
SYSTEM
TO
THE
BRAKE
CALIPERS
WHERE
MOST
OF
THE
CORROSION
OCCURS
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
PHENOMENON
IT
IS
ESSENTIAL
WHEN
CONVERTING
TO
SILICONE
TO
EMPTY
THE
ENTIRE
BRAKE
SYSTEM
AND
FLUSH
IT
THROUGHLY
BEFOREHAND
SOME
EVEN
RECOMMEND
REPLACING
ALL
RUBBER
PARTS
IN
THE
BRAKE
SYSTEM
WHEN
CONVERTING
TO
SILICONE
FLUIDS
TWO
OTHER
ISSUES
THAT
COME
UP
WITH
SILICONE
FLUIDS
THEY
ARE
DIFFICULT
TO
POUR
CLEANLY
THAT
IS
WITHOUT
AIR
BUBBLES
WHICH
INTERFERES
WITH
GETTING
A
GOOD
BRAKE
PEDAL
FEEL
AND
WHILE
THEY
GENERALLY
HAVE
MUCH
HIGHER
BOILING
POINTS
THAN
FLUIDS
THEY
DO
HAVE
HIGH
TEMPERATURE
FAILURE
MODES
WHICH
ARE
INDISTINGUISHABLE
IN
EFFECT
FROM
BOILING
FLUIDS
SILICONE
FLUIDS
MAY
MAKE
SENSE
IN
SOME
STREET
CAR
APPLICATIONS
BUT
THEY
ARE
CERTAINLY
NOT
RECOMMENDED
FOR
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
DRIVING
APPLICATIONS
AND
THE
ECONOMICS
ARE
QUESTIONABLE
FOR
STREET
USE
I
HAVE
RECENTLY
BECOME
AWARE
OF
NEW
FLUIDS
THAT
MEET
THE
STANDARD
THAT
DO
NOT
CONTAIN
SILICONES
THESE
FLUIDS
APPEAR
TO
BE
REASONABLY
COMPATIBLE
WITH
THE
OLDER
AND
FLUIDS
BUT
I
HAVE
LITTLE
INFORMATION
AT
THIS
TIME
Q
ABS
IS
AVAILABLE
ON
SOME
OF
THE
CARS
IM
LOOKING
AT
BUT
IT
COSTS
MORE
IS
IT
WORTH
IT
A
THIS
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
CUT
AND
DRIED
ANSWER
THEREFORE
THIS
ANSWER
WILL
BE
QUITE
LONG
IN
ORDER
TO
COVER
THE
PROS
AND
CONS
THE
SHORT
ANSWER
IS
THAT
ABS
COSTS
MORE
BOTH
INITIALLY
AND
TO
MAINTAIN
WILL
GENERALLY
WORK
BETTER
FOR
THE
AVERAGE
DRIVER
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
A
DRIVER
WHO
DOES
NOT
HAVE
EXTENSIVE
EXPERIENCE
IN
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
DRIVING
TECHNIQUES
AND
MAY
REQUIRE
THE
UNLEARNING
OF
SOME
OBSOLETE
BRAKING
TECHNIQUES
LIKE
PUMP
BRAKING
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
UNLEARNED
IN
ANY
CASE
NOW
FOR
THE
LONG
ANSWER
ABS
WORKS
BY
MONITERING
THE
WHEELS
OF
THE

LOOKING
FOR
SIGNS
OF
LOCKED
BRAKES
IT
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
BE
ABLE
TO
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
THE
DIFFERENT
WHEELS
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
SYSTEMS
ON
THE
MARKET
IT
CANNOT
DETECT
IMPENDING
LOCKUP
WHICH
IS
WHAT
YOU
WOULD
REALLY
WANT
IN
AN
IDEAL
WORLD
BUT
ONLY
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
LOCKUP
THE
SENSORS
USED
VARY
SOME
OF
THE
LESS
WELL
DESIGNED
SENSORS
ARE
SENSITIVE
TO
TIRE
SIZE
AND
TO
BRAKE
PAD
MATERIAL
AND
MAY
CEASE
TO
FUNCTION
PROPERLY
IF
THE
OWNER
DEVIATES
FROM
ORIGINAL
EQUIPMENT
OR
OEEQUIVALENT
COMPONENTS
WHEN
THE
SENSORS
DETECT
LOCKUP
THE
ABS
SYSTEM
RESPONDS
BY
UNLOCKING
THE
BRAKES
EITHER
INDIVIDUALLY
OR
ALL
AT
ONCE
DEPENDING
ON
THE
SYSTEM
IF
THE
DRIVER
KEEPS
THEIR
FOOT
FIRMLY
PLANTED
THE
ABS
WILL
END
UP
CYCLING
BETWEEN
THE
LOCKED
AND
UNLOCKED
STATES
IF
A
SENSOR
EXISTED
THAT
COULD
DETECT
IMPENDING
LOCKUP
THEN
WE
COULD
SIT
RIGHT
AT
THAT
POINT
WHICH
IS
WHERE
MAXIMUM
BRAKING
EFFECT
IS
ACHIEVED
THIS
PULSING
CAN
OFTEN
BE
FELT
IN

AS
THE

THE
PERCENTAGE
OF
THE
TIME
THAT
THE

ARE
TRULY
ENGAGED

CALLED
THE

TYPICALLY
IN

THIS
IS

A

QUITE

FOR
THIS
EVENTUALITY
A
PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT
FEATURE
OF
ABS
IS
THAT
IT
PRESERVES
STEERING
CONTROL
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IF
YOU
ARE
BRAKING
NEAR
THE

AND

THE

WILL
RELEASE
THE

IT

IF

DONT
EXPECT

MUCH
THE

VERY
IMPORTANT
Q
WHAT
ABOUT
THIS

BUSINESS
A
NORMALLY

NOT

QA
BUT
RECENT
PUBLICITY
ABOUT
A

THAT
THIS

THE

AND
LOCK
EM
UP
PANIC
HABIT
ENTIRELY
AND
IS
MUCH
TO
BE
PREFERED
BASICALLY
THE
PREMISE
IS
THAT
TIRES
GENERATE
MAXIMUM

WHEN
THEY
HAVE
JUST
STARTED
TO
SLIDE
BUT
JUST
BEFORE
THE

LOCK

ENTIRELY

IT
ON
THE

YOU
CAN

YOURE
NOT

IN

OFTEN
THERE
IS

IN

STARTS

IF
THE

BACKS
OFF
ON

JUST
A

WHEN

IS

THEN
THEY
ARE

THEYLL
PROBABLY
ACHIEVE

IF

JUST

ACCORDING

THE

IN
THAT
IT
IS
AN

USEFUL
TECHNIQUE
REGARDLESS

WHETHER
YOUR

IF
YOU
DO
FEAR
