im
in
the
market
for
a
new
car
currently
i
own
a
mazda
dx
which
has
served
me
just
fine
however
id
like
to
get
a
car
since
i
dont
relish
the
thought
of
moving
a
carseat
around
in
a
car
my
criteria
are
ac
amfm
cassette
quick
acceleration
cruise
control
decent
rear
seat
legroom
my
husband
is
a
it
must
also
be
under
preferably
closer
to
the
range
which
will
probably
rule
out
the
accord
the
cars
that
have
caught
my
eye
are
toyota
corolla
toyata
camry
mazda
pontiac
grand
am
pontiac
grand
prix
honda
accord
and
civic
if
its
roomy
enough
and
still
comes
in
a
model
hyundai
sonata
and
maybe
even
a
small
oldsmobile
although
not
the
achieva
all
opinions
benchmarks
recommendations
etc
are
welcome
the
civic
does
still
come
in
a
door
model
my
wife
and
i
looked
quite
seriously
at
the
prizm
corolla
and
civic
as
well
as
some
other
cars
our
impressions
all
three
seemed
well
built
and
had
the
features
we
wanted
these
are
similar
to
the
features
you
want
except
for
cruise
control
and
we
want
a
manual
transmission
and
are
considering
antilock
brakes
i
also
hate
automatic
seatbelts
and
we
both
think
having
an
airbag
is
a
plus
in
general
comfort
and
performance
were
both
significant
some
specific
s
and
s
are
listed
below
mazda
very
comfortable
and
roomy
can
theoretically
get
abs
on
dx
model
though
in
practice
this
is
hard
to
find
base
price
for
base
model
includes
numerous
little
things
like
tach
variable
speed
wipers
rear
defroster
split
folding
rear
seat
more
expensive
than
many
other
cars
listed
below
honda
civic
dx
gets
significantly
better
mileage
than
other
cars
listed
here
comfortable
front
seat
adjustable
seat
belt
mounting
no
abs
without
ex
model
includes
of
other
things
like
a
sunroof
geo
prizmtoyota
corolla
seats
not
very
comfortable
to
us
your
mileage
may
vary
adjustable
seat
belt
mounting
can
get
abs
without
lots
of
other
extras
saturn
was
quite
comfortable
though
less
so
motorized
attack
belts
dodge
spirit
no
real
outstanding
s
but
seemed
generally
ok
rear
seat
does
not
fold
down
chevy
corsica
comes
with
abs
standard
lower
would
you
buy
that
car
again
and
safety
ratings
in
consumer
reports
than
first
cars
above
suspension
didnt
feel
as
stiff
as
the
others
this
would
be
a
for
some
the
honda
accord
and
toyota
camry
were
both
more
expensive
than
the
and
in
our
minds
not
significantly
better
we
probably
gave
disproportionately
low
consideration
to
the
big
due
a
to
my
wifes
familys
general
dislike
of
chrysler
products
b
some
unimpressive
gm
products
owned
by
my
parents
and
a
housemate
of
mine
c
the
taurus
comes
with
automatic
transmission
i
find
the
seat
of
the
tempo
very
uncomfortable
and
the
escort
has
attack
belts
and
no
air
bag
well
probably
end
up
with
a
i
saw
a
dx
with
ac
and
cassette
advertised
for
just
under
washington
post
april
i
think
and
my
local
dealer
says
they
can
match
that
price
i
will
probably
get
the
maybe
tomorrow
the
main
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
or
not
i
will
have
to
do
a
factory
order
or
preference
order
to
get
one
with
abs
and
whether
or
not
the
dealership
will
run
the
price
up
a
lot
if
i
do
so
