IN

DIDNT
FEEL
AS
STIFF
AS
THE
OTHERS
THIS
WOULD
BE
A

SOME
THE

C
THE

COMES
WITH
AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION

FIND
THE

VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE
AND
THE

HAS
ATTACK
BELTS
AND
NO
AIR

WELL
PROBABLY
END

WITH
A
I
SAW
A

ADVERTISED
FOR

POST
APRIL
I
THINK
AND
MY
LOCAL
DEALER
SAYS
THEY
CAN
MATCH
THAT
PRICE
I
WILL
PROBABLY
GET
THE
MAYBE
TOMORROW
THE
MAIN
QUESTION
IN
MY
MIND
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
I
WILL
HAVE
TO
DO
A
FACTORY
ORDER
OR
PREFERENCE
ORDER
TO
GET
ONE
WITH
ABS
AND
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
DEALERSHIP
WILL
RUN
THE
PRICE
UP
A
LOT
IF
I
DO
SO
