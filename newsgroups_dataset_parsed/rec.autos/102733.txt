RE
DO
TRAINS
HAVE
RADAR
TMHADDOCK
WRITES
I
CAME
UPON
A
TRAIN
PARKED
ON
A
TRESTLE
WITH
ITS
LOCOMOTIVE
SITTING
DIRECTLY
OVER
THE
NORTHBOUND
LANES
JUST
AS
I
PASSED
FROM
UNDERNEATH
THE
TRESTLE
MY
RADAR
DETECTOR
WENT
INTO
FULL
ALERT
ALL
LIGHTS
LIT
AND
ALL
CHIRPS
BEEPS
AND
BUZZES
GOING
STRONG
COULD
THIS
HAVE
BEEN
CAUSED
BY
THE
TRAINS
RADIO
OR
WHAT
RECENTLYMANUFACTURED
LOCOMOTIVES
HAVE
WHEELSLIP
DETECTION
SYSTEMS
THAT
USE
FREQUENCIES
SHARED
WITH
POLICE
RADAR
I
FORGET
WHICH
BAND
THESE
WILL
SET
OFF
YOUR
RADAR
DETECTOR
IF
YOU
GET
CLOSE
ENOUGH
THOUGH
I
BELIEVE
THE
RANGE
IS
PRETTY
SHORT
BTW
RAILROAD
POLICE
SOMETIMES
USE
RADAR
TO
CHECK
FOR
SPEEDING
TRAINS
JUST
LIKE
REGULAR
POLICE
CHECK
FOR
SPEEDING
CARS
ALTHOUGH
THE
INTENT
HERE
IS
FOR
SAFETY
NOT
REVENUE
COLLECTION
UNLIKE
WITH
CARS
