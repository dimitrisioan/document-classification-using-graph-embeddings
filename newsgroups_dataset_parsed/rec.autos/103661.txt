RE
THE
MUSTANG
YOU
KNOW
IM
A
FORD
FAN
I
MUST
SAY
SO
IM
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
THE
NEXT
MUSTANG
I
HAVE
FAITH
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
A
FINE
PRODUCT
MORE
DESIREABLE
THAN
THE
CAMARO
IS
NOW
YOU
KNOW
THATS
MHO
TRUETHATS
YOUR
OPINION
THEY
BEAT
FORD
TO
THE
MARKET
WITH
THE
CAMAROFIREBIRD
BUT
REALLY
ONLY
IN
WORDS
PRODUCTION
OF
THESE
VEHICLES
WILL
BE
LIMITED
UNTIL
THE
END
OF
THE
YEAR
KEEPING
SELLING
PRICES
ABOVE
MSRP
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
SINCE
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
TWITCHING
CAMARO
FANS
OUT
THERE
I
WOULDNT
PRESS
FORD
TO
HURRY
THE
MUSTANG
SINCE
THE
FINAL
WAIT
COULD
BE
WORTH
IT
BESIDES
NO
BOWTIE
FANATIC
IS
GONNA
BUY
THE
MUSTANG
ANYWAY
TRUE
AGAIN
I
WOULDNT
TAKE
A
FREE
MUSTANGHONEST
THE
NEXT
MUSTANG
WILL
BE
FORDS
HIGHEST
PROFILE
CAR
IT
ATTRACTS
WAY
MORE
ATTENTION
THAN
THE
CAMAROFIREBIRD
BECAUSE
ITS
HERITAGE
IS
MORE
EMBEDDED
IN
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
DONT
LIE
TO
YOURSELF
AND
BELIEVE
FORD
WILL
FORFEIT
THAT
FYI
THEY
ALREADY
DID
TOO
BAD
THAT
THE
CURRENT
MUSTANG
CANT
EVEN
COMPETE
WITH
THE
NEW
CAMARO
WITHOUT
USING
AN
ACTIVE
IMAGINATION
RIGHT
NOW
FEW
CARS
CAN
COMPARE
WITH
THE
CAMARO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
FOR
A
CAR
THAT
WILL
OUT
PERFORM
ALL
BUT
A
FEW
EXOTICS
IF
YOU
ARE
NOW
SWEARING
AT
ME
LOOK
AT
THE
STATSTHEY
DONT
LIE
THERE
ARE
NO
COMPARABLE
CARS
IN
ITS
CLASS
CERTINALY
NOT
FOR
ITS
PRICE
YOU
KNOWINTELLIGENT
CRITICAL
SPEWS
LIKE
THE
MUSTANG
BITES
MAN
SOME
OF
YOU
ARE
ALREADY
BEGINNING
I
PREDICT
THAT
THE
MUSTANG
AND
CAMARO
WILL
BE
COMPARABLE
PERFORMERS
AS
USUAL
I
ALSO
AGREE
THIS
SUBJECT
IS
ONE
THAT
WILL
NEVER
BE
SETTELED
EXCEPT
MAYBE
AT
THE
TRACK
UNLESS
THE
FORD
GETS
THE
ROMEO
YOU
DONT
SERIOUSLY
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
WAS
DESIGNED
FOR
THE
MARK
VIII
ONLY
DO
YOU
HEY
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
THE
POTENTIAL
OF
A
MODIFIED
FOLKS
IN
A
FEW
YEARS
WE
WILL
SURPASS
THE
LEVELS
OF
PERFORMANCE
ACHIEVED
IN
THE
LATE
THATS
SCARY
YOU
FORD
VS
CHEVY
PEOPLE
MUST
LIVE
IN
THE
PLANET
OF
DETROIT
OR
DROID
LIKE
THEY
SAY
IN
THE
AIRFORCE
WITH
ENOUGH
HORSEPOWER
ANYTHING
WILL
FLY
I
CAN
PUT
A

TWIN
ON
YUGO
AND
GET
QM
THATS
USELESS
ITS
STILL
A
YUGO
THAT
WILL
LOOSE
ANY
RACE
ON
A
TRACK
OR
ON
THE
STREET
HAVE
YOU

OF

THE
TURBO
OR
I
LL
BUY
IT
IN

OR
THE
TORSEN
DIFFERENTIAL
OF
THE
COMPARED
TO
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
OF
THE
THAT
SOUNDS
IN
EVERY
HAIRPIN
TURN
AND
