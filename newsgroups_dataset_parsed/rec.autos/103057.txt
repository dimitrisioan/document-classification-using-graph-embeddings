RE
NEW
TALON
I
WOULD
ALSO
BE
INTERESTED
IN
FINDING
OUT
ABOUT
THE
TALON
AND
I
SUSPECT
THAT
MANY
OTHER
PEOPLE
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
TOO
SO
LETS
GET
SOME
RESPONSES
ON
THE
NET
THE
QUESTION
AGAIN
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
INFO
ON
THE
EAGLE
TALON
MITSUBISHI
ECLIPSE
PLYMOUTH
LASER
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
OLD
TALON
WAS
BASED
ON
THE
MITSUBISHI
GALANT
AND
THAT
IN
JAPAN
A
HP
TWINTURBO
GALANT
HAS
BEEN
RELEASED
SO
ANYWAY
ANY
INFO
ON
THE
TALON
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
