HOW
ABOUT
THIS
TO
ARGUE
ABOUT
WHY
DOES

A
MUCH
LOWER
BASE

ITS
OVER
CHEAPERI
FORGET
THE
EXACT
AMOUNT
DOESNT
IT
COST
MORE
TO
HAVE
THE
EXTRA

THAT
ARE
IN

PERHAPS
IT
IS
JUST
A

THEIR
CORE
COMPETITION
IS
THE
CIVIC
COROLLA
AND
SENTRA
MOST
OF
THE
OTHER
MODELS
ARE
IN
THE
SAME
CLASS
BUT
ARENT
THE
FIRST
CARS
YOU
WOULD
THINK
OF
I
THREW
IN
THE
ESCORTTRACER
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
A
GOOD
AMOUNT
OF
JAPANESE
TECHNOLOGY
AND
HAS
SIMILAR
RELIABILITY
STATS
I
DIDNT
INCLUDE
DOMESTIC
SMALL
CARS
SUCH
AS
THE
CAVALIER
SUNBIRD
SHADOW
SUNDANCE
TEMPO
AND
TOPAZ
SINCE
I
THINK
SATURN
IS
GOING
AFTER
CARS
THAT
HAVE
AT

SOME
DEGREE
OF
JAPANESE

THE
WAS

TO

AGAINST

IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
PRICES
OF
THESE
CARS
THEYRE
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
THEYRE
COUNTERPARTS
THE
IS
GOOD
REASON
FOR
THIS
IT
IS
A
MORE
UPSCALE
AND
TRENDDRIVEN
MARKET
EVEN
THOUGH
MANY
OF
THESE
MODELS
ARE
BASED
ON
SEDAN
PLATFORMS
THEIR
INTERIOR
ETC
IS
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
WARRANT
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
PRICES
HERE
ARE
SOME
OF
THE
PLATFORM
DERIVATIONS
I
CAN
THINK
OF
TERCEL

DEL
SOL
NOT
SURE
ON
THIS
ONE
STYLUS
IMPULSESTORM
TO
ILLUSTRATE
A
TERCEL
STARTS
AT
AROUND
WHILE
THE
PASEO
STARTS
AT
AROUND
EVEN
A
TERCEL
WILL
COST
LESS
THAN
A
PASEO
NOW
YOU
MIGHT
BE
SAYING
THAT
THE
TERCEL
DOESNT
OFFER
THE
POWER
THAT
SOME
OFFER
WHAT
I
MEAN
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
TERCEL
WITH
A
COMPARABLE
POWERPLANT
AS
ITS
SPORT
COUPE
DERIVATIVE
LETS
TAKE
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
THE
ISUZU
STYLUS
XS
AND
IMPULSE
XSSTORM
GSI
BOTH
HAVE
THE
SAME
POWERPLANTS
A
ENGINE
BUT
THE
SMALLER
COUPES
ARE
GENERALLY
MORE
EXPENSIVE
AGAIN
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THE
TWODOOR
SPORT
COUPE
MARKET
IS
A
MORE
FASHIONORIENTED
AND
TRENDSETTING
SEGMENT
PEOPLE
ARE
WILLING
TO
PAY
MORE
MONEY
FOR
THIS
TYPE
OF
CAR
IN
SHORT
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
MAY
BE
SMALLER
HENCE
LESS
CAR
ITS
MARKET
ORIENTATION
DICTATES
A
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
PRICE
THAN
ITS
MECHANICALLY
EQUIVALENT
SEDAN
VERSION
I
HOPE
THIS
CLEARS
THINGS
UP
A
BIT
