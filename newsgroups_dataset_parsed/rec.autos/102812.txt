THAT

TO

I
OWNED

I
DECIDED

A

A
MORE
EXOTIC
CAR

INCLUDED
THE
TOYOTA
SUPRA
TURBO
AND
THE
PORSCHE
MODEL
YEARS
I
NARROWED
IT
DOWN
TO
THOSE
TWO
I
LIKED
THE
SIMPLICITY
AND
HANDLING
AND
SNOB
APPEAL
TOO
OF
DRIVING
A
PORSCHE
THE
SUPRA
TURBO
WAS
LESS
MONEY
AND
HAD
MORE
FEATURES
AND
PERFORMANCE
ALMOST
A
PERSONAL
LUXURY
CAR
IT
HAD
BETTER
ACCELERATION
AND
A
HIGHER
TOP
SPEED
THAN
THE
I
WAS
ALMOST
READY
TO
GIVE
IN
TO
A
BUYING
IMPULSE
FOR
THE
BUT
I
DECIDED
TO
STOP
BY
MY
INSURANCE
AGENTS
OFFICE
ON
THE
WAY
I
ASKED
ABOUT
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
TO
MY
RATE
WITH
EITHER
CAR
IF
YOU
BUY
THE
SUPRA
YOUR
RATE
CLASSIFICATION
WILL
BE
THE
SAME
AS
THE
CELICA
THE
CELICA
WAS
CONSIDERED
A
SUBCOMPACT
AND
FOR
THAT
YEAR
WAS
RATED
AS
ONE
OF
THE
SAFEST
CARS
WITH
A
SLIGHT
INCREASE
BECAUSE
THE
CAR
WILL
BE
YEARS
NEWER
OUR
LOWERRISK
DIVISION
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
HANDLE
YOUR
ACCOUNT
IF
YOU
BUY
THE
PORSCHE
WELL
HAVE
TO
CHANGE
YOU
TO
THE
STANDARD
HIGHER
RATE
COMPANY
AND
YOUR
RATE
WILL
DOUBLE
AND
IF
YOU
GO
WITH
A
ITS
ANOTHER
STORY
AGAIN
WELL
COVER
THE
REST
OF
THIS
YEAR
BUT
CANCEL
YOU
AFTER
THAT
BUT
THE
SUPRA
IS
MUCH
FASTER
THAN
THE
AND
THE
IS
ACTUALLY
FASTER
THAN
THE
STANDARD
THAT
DOENST
MAKE
SENSE
THATS
WHAT
THE
BOOK
SAYS
WE
DONT
INSURE
CORVETTES
EITHER
FOR
SOME
REASON
THE
UNDERWRITERS
CONSIDER
SUPRAS
AND
THEIR
DRIVERS
AS
VERY
TRADITIONAL
AND
CONSERVATIVE
I
EVENTUALLY
WENT
WITH
THE
SUPRA
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
THE
PORSCHE
DEALER
HAD
A
NICE
SALESMAN
TO
GET
ME
INTERESTED
BUT
A
TOUGH
HIGHPRESSURE
GUY
IN
THE
BACK
ROOM
AT
EQUAL
MONTHLY
PAYMENTS
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
A
YEAR
LONGER
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
PORSCHE
PLUS
ITS
HIGHER
INSURANCE
I
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
HIGH
INSURANCE
WAS
RELATED
TO
PROBABILITY
OF
AUTO

ENTITLED
TO
MY
