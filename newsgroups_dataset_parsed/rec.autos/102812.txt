its
a

munny
unforgiven
i
am
beyond
the
under
age
group
but
i
have
an
experience
a
few
years
ago
that
might
be
interesting
to
you
i
owned
a
toyota
celica
gt
i
decided
to
buy
myself
a
gift
a
more
exotic
car
front
runners
included
the
toyota
supra
turbo
and
the
porsche
model
years
i
narrowed
it
down
to
those
two
i
liked
the
simplicity
and
handling
and
snob
appeal
too
of
driving
a
porsche
the
supra
turbo
was
less
money
and
had
more
features
and
performance
almost
a
personal
luxury
car
it
had
better
acceleration
and
a
higher
top
speed
than
the
i
was
almost
ready
to
give
in
to
a
buying
impulse
for
the
but
i
decided
to
stop
by
my
insurance
agents
office
on
the
way
i
asked
about
what
would
happen
to
my
rate
with
either
car
if
you
buy
the
supra
your
rate
classification
will
be
the
same
as
the
celica
the
celica
was
considered
a
subcompact
and
for
that
year
was
rated
as
one
of
the
safest
cars
with
a
slight
increase
because
the
car
will
be
years
newer
our
lowerrisk
division
will
continue
to
handle
your
account
if
you
buy
the
porsche
well
have
to
change
you
to
the
standard
higher
rate
company
and
your
rate
will
double
and
if
you
go
with
a
its
another
story
again
well
cover
the
rest
of
this
year
but
cancel
you
after
that
but
the
supra
is
much
faster
than
the
and
the
is
actually
faster
than
the
standard
that
doenst
make
sense
thats
what
the
book
says
we
dont
insure
corvettes
either
for
some
reason
the
underwriters
consider
supras
and
their
drivers
as
very
traditional
and
conservative
i
eventually
went
with
the
supra
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
porsche
dealer
had
a
nice
salesman
to
get
me
interested
but
a
tough
highpressure
guy
in
the
back
room
at
equal
monthly
payments
it
would
have
taken
a
year
longer
to
pay
for
the
porsche
plus
its
higher
insurance
i
concluded
that
the
high
insurance
was
related
to
probability
of
auto
theft
everyones
entitled
to
my
opinion
goldbergoasysdtnavymil
imagination
is
more
important

knowledge
albert

i
live
in
idaho
when
i
was
many
years
ago
years
i
bought
a
trans
am
new
insurance
was
about
when
i
turned
it
immediately
dropped
to
i
had
not
had
any
accidents
before
or
after
this
was
strictly
an
age
change
that
same
rate
stayed
pretty
much
the
same
until
i
sold
the
car
years
ago
my
pickup
is
about
less
the
real
amazing
thing
is
that
when
i
woke
up
at
age
i
felt
so
much
more
responsible
than
i
was
before

knock

wood
mass
one
thing
that
makes
a
huge
difference
in
mass
is
the
town
you
live
in
im
personally
in
one
of
the
best
towns
within
reasonable
distance
of
boston
if
i
moved
to
the
absolute
best
it
would
go
down
to
about
if
i
moved
to
the
worst
it
would
be
also
one
accident
and
a
couple
of
tickets
would
probably
add
another
rv
i
have
a
mitsubishi
eclipse
turbo
awd
am
years
old
and
have
no
tickets
that
went
on
my
record
i
live
in
illinois
just
outside
of
chicago
and
pay
a
year
with
full
coverage
at
state
farm
i
did
get
a
small
discount
because
of
my
alarm
a
year
i
only
live
miles
from
chicago
but
if
i
actually
lived
in
the
city
the
price
would
be
about
a
year
im
over
but
in
case
youre
interested
anyway
im
insuring
a
sho
for
month
thats
property
with
deductible
glass
and
towing
state
farm
unless
you
are
under
or
have
been
driving
for
less
than
years
i
think
you
are
being
seriously
ripped
off
i
dont
have
one
of
the
performance
cars
you
listed
but
if
your
record
is
clean
then
you
should
not
be
paying
over
did
you
try
calling
all
the
insurance
dealers
you
could
find
although
rates
are
supposed
to
be
standardized
ive
found
that
most
places
i
initially
call
give
me
some
ridiculously
high
quote
and
finaly
i
hit
one
that
is
much
lower
also
i
have
changed
insurance
companies
when
the
rate
went
up
at
renewal
no
accidents
tickets
car
gets
older
to
maintain
a
low
rate
you
always
have
to
be
careful
when
it
comes
to
insurance
companies
good
luck
