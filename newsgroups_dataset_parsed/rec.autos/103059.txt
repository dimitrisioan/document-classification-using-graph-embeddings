INSURANCE
QUESTION
FROM
LIBEMCBYUVMBITNET
IM
ABOUT
TO
BUY
A
NEW
CAR
AND
FINANCE
SOME
OF
IT
SINCE
I
PAID
CASH
FOR
THE
LAST

BOUGHT
I
DID
NOT
HAVE
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
I
HAD
A
GOOD
AMOUNT
OF
INSURANCE
ON
IT
BECAUSE
OF
A
BANK
LOAN
I
JUST
PUT
THE
AMOUNT
THAT
I
WANTED
NOT
WHAT
A
BANK
WOULD
HAVE
WANTED
FRIENDS
ARE
TELLING
ME
THAT
BANKS
REQUIRE
SOME
KIND
OF
INSURANCE
ON
THE
CAR
TO
PROTECT
IT
SINCE
IT
IS
COLLATERAL
ON
LOANS
IS
THIS
TRUE
CAN
THAT
INSURANCE
BE
GOTTEN
AS
PART
OF
MY
OTHER
INSURANCE
I
ASSUME
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
PAY
A
DEALER
FOR
EXTRA
INSURANCE
OVER
MY
REGULAR
CAR
INSURANCE
AM
I
CORRECT
I
HEAR
ABOUT
ACCIDENTHEALTH
TYPE
INSURANCE
AT
THE
DEALERS
AND
I
AM
PRETTY
SURE
THESE
ARE
JUST
MONEY
MAKERS
FOR
THEM
I
JUST
WANT
TO
VERIFY
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
BUY
THESE
AT
ALL
OR
ANY
OTHER
TYPES
OF
EXTRAS
