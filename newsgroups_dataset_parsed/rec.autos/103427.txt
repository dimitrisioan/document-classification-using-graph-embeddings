WRITES
THE
SOUND
HE
DESCRIBES
IS
COMMON
TO
ANY
OLDER
TOYOTA
ENGINE
I
EVER
HEARD
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
RELEVANCE
OF
HIS
OBSERVATIONS
ABOUT
OIL
CHANGES
MY
SIMPLY
MAKES
NOISE
NOT
ALL
THAT
ANNOYING
MIND
YOU
BUT
YOU
HEAR
IT
WELL
WHEN
THE
ENGINE
IS
RIGHT
BEHIND
YOUR
LEFT
EAR
I
THINK
THOSE
WITH
WOULD
DESCRIBE
THE
ENGINE
AS
SWEET
IF
A
LITTLE
LOUD
THOSE
WITH
I
CANT
IMAGINE
ANY
UNBIASED
PERSON
PAYING
IT
ANY
COMPLIMENTS
SOUNDED
LIKE
MY
EXDORMMATES
RUSTY
CHEVY
CHEVETTE
WITH
THE
I
WOULD
WANT
TO
REDLINE
IT
JUST
FOR
THE
MUSIC
WITH
THE
I
WOULD
SHORT
SHIFT
SO
THAT
IT
WOULD
SHUT
UP
THE
NEW
CAMRY
FEATURES
BALANCE
SHAFTS
I
GUESS
SINCE
THE
IS
GETTING
THE
AXE
IT
IS
TOO
LATE
FOR
THEM
TO
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THIS
IT
IS
NO
MYSTERY
THAT
THE
TURBO
IS
ONLY
LITERS
THE
ENGINEERS
HAD
ENOUGH
INTEGRITY
TO
PREVENT
ANY
FURTHER
ABUSES
ALSO
IN
EUROPE
THE
NONTURBO
WAS
ALSO
ONLY
LITERS
AS
USUAL
THE
UNDISCRIMINATING
AMERICAN
MARKET
IF
IT
IS
JAPANESE
IT
MUST
BE
GOOD
GETS
THE
DOGS
TO
BE
FAIR
WE
ALSO
GOT
THE
TURBO
WHICH
THE
EUROPEANS
WELL
THE
IS
MUSIC
TO
MY
EARS
I
OFTEN
TURN
MY
STEREO
OFF
AND
JUST
RUN
IT
TOWARDS
RED
LINE
ON
NICE
TWISTY
ROADS
BUT
TOYOTA
ENGINES
AT
IDLE
HAVE
A
STRANGE
BELLS
AND
WHISSTLES
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
A
MATAL
CAN
SOUND
I
CANT
DESCRIBE
IT
ANY
BETTER
JUST
LIKE
ALL
THE
OLDER
BENZES
HAVE
A
VERY
CHARACTERISTIC
CLATTERING
SOUND
AT
IDLE
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
IM
REFERRING
TO
MIKES
