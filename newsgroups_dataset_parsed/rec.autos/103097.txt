its
a
big
aftermarket
business
almost
no
cars
come
from
the
factory
with
vynal
any
more
and
any
fake
convertible
job
definitely
came
from
some
aftermarket
place
what
amazes
me
is
how
much
people
are
willing
to
pay
for
bad
taste
how
about
those
really
ugly
fake
wheel
compartments
stuck
onto
the
trunk
or
side
or
both
sides
of
some
tacky
luxury
cars
some
of
em
arent
fake
if
youre
talking
about
the
continental
kit
named
after
the
lincoln
continental
the
first
car
to
sport
one
i
personally
would
love
to
have
a
tbird
with
a
continental
kit
and
the
supercharged
that
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
cars
ever
built
imho
james
the
continental
may
have
been
the
first
modern
era
auto
to
mount
the
spare
on
the
rear
of
the
car
but
it
was
hardly
the
first
car
to
sport
one
various
mounting
techniques
for
rear
mounting
the
spare
were
quite
common
in
early
automobiles
both
us
and
foreign
the
lincoln
continental
was
the
first
car
to
sport
the
continental
kit
the
continental
kit
is
not
to
be
confused
with
ye
olde
outside
mounting
bracket
a
continental
kit
is
a
very
specific
ornamentstorage
compartment
the
continental
has
a
neat
trunk
it
looks
rather
like
a
laundry
hamper

the
forecast
calls
for
tbird
sc
its
a
hell
of
a
thing
killing
a
man

away
all
he

and
all
hes
ever
gonna
have
will
munny
