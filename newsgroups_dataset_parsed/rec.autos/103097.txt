WHAT
AMAZES
ME
IS
HOW
MUCH

ARE
WILLING
TO

FOR

HOW
ABOUT

IF
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
CONTINENTAL
KIT
NAMED
AFTER
THE
LINCOLN
CONTINENTAL
THE
FIRST
CAR
TO
SPORT
ONE
I
PERSONALLY
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HAVE
A
TBIRD
WITH
A
CONTINENTAL
KIT
AND
THE
SUPERCHARGED
THAT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
CARS
EVER
BUILT
IMHO

THE
CONTINENTAL
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
FIRST
MODERN
ERA
AUTO
TO
MOUNT
THE
SPARE
ON
THE
REAR
OF
THE
CAR
BUT
IT
WAS
HARDLY
THE
FIRST
CAR
TO
SPORT
ONE
VARIOUS
MOUNTING
TECHNIQUES
FOR
REAR
MOUNTING
THE
SPARE
WERE
QUITE
COMMON
IN
EARLY
AUTOMOBILES
BOTH
US
AND
FOREIGN
THE
LINCOLN
CONTINENTAL
WAS
THE
FIRST
CAR
TO
SPORT
THE
CONTINENTAL
KIT
THE
CONTINENTAL
KIT
IS
NOT
TO
BE
CONFUSED
WITH

OLDE
OUTSIDE

A
CONTINENTAL

A
VERY

THE

IT
LOOKS
RATHER
LIKE
