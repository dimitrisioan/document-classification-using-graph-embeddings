JIM
FROST
WRITES
STUFF
ABOUT
AUTOBAHN
AND
SAFETY
OF
SHO
AT
SPEED
DELETED
THE
MUSTANG
IS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
DEAL
AS
THE
SHO
A
BIG
POWER
THE
MUSTANG
IS
A
MUCH
WORSE
CASE
OF
DESIGN
IRRESPONSIBILITY
THAN
THE
SHO
PLANT
STUCK
IN
A
MIDSIZE
SEDAN
WITH
ALMOST
NO
OTHER
MODIFICATIONS
I
HAVE
REALLIFE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THE
MUSTANG
IT
HANDLES
LIKE
A
BRICK
EXCEPT
WHEN
YOURE
INVOKING
OVERSTEER
OF
COURSE
SOMETHING
I
ITS
HARD
TO
PREDICATBALY
DRIFT
A
STOCK
MUSTANG
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SUSPENSION
PERSONALLY
AVOID
DOING
ON
THE
HIGHWAY
AND
STOPPING
POWER
IS
INADEQUATE
EVEN
FROM
LOTS
OF
ACCELLERATION
BUT
THE
REST
OF
THE
CAR
IS
NOT
UP
TO
PAR
YES
WHEN
I
THINK
MUSTANG
I
THINK
SCHOOLBUS
MOTOR
IN
MY
MIND
THE
MUSTANG
SHOULD
BE
FITTED
WITH
A
SPEED
LIMITER
AT
OR
SO
IT
JUST
ISNT
SAFE
CHECK
OUT
YOUR
LOCAL
JUNKYARD
MUSTANGS
OUTNUMBER
OTHER
CARS
BY
A
PROPORTION
WAY
IN
EXCESS
OF
SALES
IN
JUNKYARDS
I
FIND
IT
ASTONISHING
THE
CU
OR
SOMESUCHLIKE
HAS
NOT
JUMPED
ON
THE
MUSTANG
FOR
POOR
BRAKES
IN
RELATION
TO
POWER
FORD
SHOULD
AT
LEAST
STANDARDIZE
ON
THE
SVO
REAR
BRAKES
FOR
ALL
I
PICKED
THE
PORSCHE
EXAMPLE
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
DESIGNED
WITH
SPEED
IN
MIND
IT
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
BE
THE
IT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
MUCH
CHEAPER
OR
ONE
OF
SEVERAL
MERCEDES
OR
AUDI
MODELS
ALL
OF
THESE
CARS
ARE
FAIRLY
EXPENSIVE
BUT
SO
ARE
THE
PARTS
THAT
MAKE
THEM
DRIVABLE
AT
HIGH
SPEED
THIS
SHOULD
BE
ELEMENTARY
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
THINGS
TO
KEEP
IN
MIND
ABOUT
EUROPE
SINCE
YOU
BROUGHT
IT
UP
MY
AUTOBAHN
KNOWLEDGE
IS
ADMITTEDLY
SECONDHAND
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THE
FOLLOWING
TO
BE
TRUE
DRIVERS
ARE
MUCH
BETTER
DISCIPLINED
IN
EUROPE
THAN
THEY
ARE
HERE
TRUE
OF
NORTHERN
EUROPE
LATIN
COUNTRIES
ARE
SOMETHING
ELSE
THE
ROADS
COMPRISING
THE
AUTOBAHN
ARE
MUCH
BETTER
DESIGNED
THAN
KINDOF
TRUE
REMEMBER
THEY
WERE
BUILD
BY
ADOLF
IN
THE
THEY
ARE
HERE
AND
USUALLY
INCLUDE
ANIMAL
FENCES
THIS
MAKES
THEM
FAR
MORE
PREDICTABLE
THAN
MOST
US
HIGHWAYS
YES
NOT
ALL
OF
EUROPE
IS
THE
AUTOBAHN
MOST
PLACES
IN
EUROPE
HAVE
AUTOBAHN
IS
THE
GERMAN
WORD
FOR
FREEWAY
OTHER
COUNTRIES
HAVE
DIFFERENT
NAMES
FOR
LOOSE
EQUIVALENTS
AUTOSTRADA
AUTOROUTE
MOTORWAY
ETC
SPEED
LIMITS
THAT
ARENT
OUTOFLINE
WITH
WHAT
WE
USED
TO
HAVE
IN
THE
US
IF
MY
FRIENDS
WERENT
LYING
TO
ME
THEYRE
TYPICALLY
NOT
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
EUROPE
DID
SEEM
ON
THE
BRINK
OF
A
LIMIT
IT
HASNT
PASSED
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
TYPICAL
SPEEDS
IN
WESTERN
EUROPE
ARE
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
THE
US
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
IS
NEGLIGIBLE
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
COMAPRED
TO
THE
US
AS
THERE
IS
NO
REVENUE
ENHANCEMENT
MOTIVATION
THE
THINGS
YOU
REALLY
NOTICE
ARE
THE
HIGHER
SPEED
DIFFERENTIALS
AND
THE
MORE
PROFESSIONAL
ATTITUDE
TO
DRIVING
YOU
JUST
NEVER
SEE
TWO
CARS
RUNNING
PARALLEL
AT
MPH
OBLIVIOUS
TO
ALL
AROUND
THEM
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
YOU
WONT
FIND
A
LOT
OF
RABBIT
OWNERS
DOING
NEARLY
ON
THE
AUTOBAHN
BUT
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
SOME
PEOPLE
YOURE
WRONG
GTIS
GO
THIS
FAST
JUST
KIND
OF
NOISY
NOT
THE
IDEAL
AUTOBAHN
CAR
A
LOT
OF
TIMES
YOU
SEE
CARS
BEING
DRIVEN
WITH
THE
DRIVERS
FOOT
ON
THE
FLOOR
HOW
DO
I
KNOW
WHEN
YOURE
NOT
MAKING
ANY
GROUND
ON
THE
IDENTICAL
CAR
IN
FRONT
OF
YOU
HAVE
NO
RESPECT
FOR
THEIR
OWN
LIVES
IF
SOMETHING
HAPPENS
AT
YOURE
DEAD
BUT
THE
SAME
GOES
FOR
MUCH
OVER
DRIVING
AT
HIGH
SPEED
FORCES
YOU
TO
CONCENTRATE
I
FEEL
MUCH
SAFER
DRIVING
ON
THE
AUTOBAHN
THAN
IN
TYPICAL
US
TRAFFIC
BECAUSE
MOST
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
BE
AWAKE
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANY
DRIVER
READING
A
BOOK
ON
AN
AUTOBAHN
I
SEE
IT
ALL
TOO
OFTEN
IN
THE
US
CRAIG
IT
JUST
DOESNT
SEEM
FAST
AFTER
MINUTES
OR
SO
OF
ACLIMATION
EVERYBODY
DRIVES
THAT
FAST
NO
BIG
DEAL
CRAIG
YOU
CERTAINLY
HAVENT
CONVINCED
ME
OF
COURSE
NOT

YOUR

ALREADY
IF
