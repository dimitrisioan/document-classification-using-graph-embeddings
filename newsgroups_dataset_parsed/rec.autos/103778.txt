a
i
recall
someone
telling
that
it
was
something
like
of
a
ford
not
only
the

correct
spelling
but
the
wagon
and
sedan
used
a
cc
or
cc
from
ford
of
germany
this
particular
motor
had
a
degree
vee
angle
a
balance
shaft
and
siamesed

this
motor
was
later
stretched
into

gave
up
with
this
motor

then
made
the

half
a
stag
under
license
i
believe
but
with
capacity
and
perhaps
a
different
arrangement
for
the
cylinder
head
studs
before
developing
their
own
straight
four
from
