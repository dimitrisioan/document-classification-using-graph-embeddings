i
heard
the
diesels
are
considered
cleanerburning
than
gas
engines
because
the
emit
less
of
carbon
monoxide
hydrocarbons
and
oxides
of
nitrogen
co
hc
nox
but
they
can
put
out
a
lot
of
particulate
matter
i
heard
something
about
legislation
being
discussed
to
clean
up
diesel
emissions
is
there
anything
in
the
works
to
install
scrubbers
for
diesels
how
about
the
feasibility
of
installing
them
on
trucks
and
cars
would
it
be
any
different
than
a
catylitic
converter
id
assume
easier
since
were
removing
particulate
matter
instead
of
converting
gasses
lets
hear
peoples
opinions
vw
and
mercedes
have
tinkered
with
particulate
traps
also
vw
uses
a
kind
of
turbocharger
on
their
jetta
ecodiesel
that
helps
reduce
particulates
as
well
although
i
dont
know
the
mechanics
of
it
many
diesel
carsbusses
and
trucks
in
europe
are
now
being
equipped
with
catalysts
and
traps
in
an
effort
to
clean
up
diesel
emissions
already
well
below
legal
limits
anyway
its
a
shame
gm
had
to
soil
the
diesels
reputation
in
passenger
cars
and
prevent
further
resource
devotion
to
research
into
making
this
outstandingly
efficient
engine
even
further
ahead
of
gas
engines
in
emissions

i
sure
dont
know
what
and
how
they
measure
in
regards
to
diesel
motors
in
cars
trucks
and
busses
but
i
think
they
are
probably
measuring
the
wrong
pollutants
or
at
the
wrong
time
or
both
i
certainly
find
it
offensive
to
drive
behind
a
diesel
bus
or
diesel
truck
and
some
diesel
cars
they
stink
and
its
always
rollupthewindows
panic
time
when
one
comes
by
or
ducks
in
front
of
me
when
i
am
driving
with
my
family
i
dont
think
the
combustion
mixture
is
kept
under
very
good
control
in
diesel
engines
and
thats
why
they
stink
so
the
invisible
unsmellable
pollutants
are
reduced
in
diesels
yeah
well
so
what
someone
forgot
about
the
visible
stinky
kind
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
those
kind
are
just
as
bad
i
am
all
for
destinking
the
diesel
vehicles
itll
keep
the
traffic
signs
cleaner
too

they
