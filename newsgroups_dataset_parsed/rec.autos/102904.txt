THIS
JUST
A
WARNING
TO
EVERYBODY
ON
THE
NET
WATCH
OUT
FOR
FOLKS
STANDING
NEXT
TO
THE
ROAD
OR
ON
OVERPASSES
THEY
CAN
CAUSE
SERIOUS
HARM
TO
YOU
AND
YOUR
CAR
JUST
A
CLIFFNOTES
VERSION
OF
MY
STORY
FOLLOWS
LAST
NIGHT
I
WAS
TRAVELLING
ON
THE
INTERSTATE
HERE
IN
KNOXVILLE
I
WAS
TAKING
AN
OFFRAMP
EXIT
TO
ANOTHER
INTERSTATE
AND
MY
WIFE
SUDDENLY
SCREAMED
AND
SOMETHING
LARGE
HIT
THE
SIDE
OF
MY
TRUCK
WE
SLOWED
DOWN
BUT
AFTER
LOOKING
BACK
TO
SEE
THE
VANDALS
STANDING
THERE
WE
DROVE
ON
TO
THE
POLICE
STATION
SHE
DID
GET
A
GOOD
LOOK
AT
THE
GUY
AND
SAW
HIM
COCK
HIS
ARM
WITH
SOMETHING
THE
SIZE
OF
A
CINDERBLOCK
BUT
I
NEVER
SAW
HIM
WE
ARE
VERY
LUCKY
THE
TRUCK
SITS
UP
HIGH
ON
THE
ROAD
IF
IT
WOULD
HAVE
HIT
HER
WINDOW
IT
WOULD
HAVE
KILLED
HER
THE
POLICE
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
THE
GUY
BUT
IN
ALL
LIKELYHOOD
HE
IS
GONE
STUFF
DELETED
I
AM
SORRY
TO
REPORT
THAT
IN
SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA
IT
WAS
A
SICK
SPORT
FOR
A
WHILE
TO
DROP
CONCRETE
BLOCKS
FROM
THE
OVERPASSES
ONTO
THE
FREEWAY
SEVERAL
PERSONS
WERE
KILLED
WHEN
SAID
BLOCKS
CAME
THROUGH
THEIR
WINDSHIELDS
MANY
OVERPASS
BRIDGES
ARE
NOW
FENCED
AND
THEY
HAVE
MADE
IT
ILLEGAL
TO
LOITER
ON
SUCH
BRIDGES
AS
IF
THAT
WOULD
STOP
SUCH
PEOPLE
YET
MANY
BRIDGES
ARE
NOT
FENCED
I
ALWAYS
LOOK
UP
AT
A
BRIDGE
WHILE
I
STILL
HAVE
TIME
TO
TAKE
EVASIVE
ACTION
EVEN
THOUGH
THIS
SPORT
HAS
NOT
REACHED
US
