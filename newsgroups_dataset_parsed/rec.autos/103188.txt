I
FIGURE
THAT
COLLISIONS
INTO
BRICK
WALLS
ARENT
COMMON
ENOUGH
FOR
ME
TO
SPEND
THAT
MUCH
EXTRA
MONEY
FOR
PROTECTION
BUT
THERE
ARE
LOTS
OF
LOWSPEED
COLLISIONS
THAT
DO
WORRY
ME
GET
INTO
AN
MPH
ACCIDENT
AND
YOU
MAY
RECONSIDER
IVE
BEEN
IN
ONE
AND
IT
IS
REALLY
SCAREY
MY
LIFE
IS
SOMETHING
I
VALUE
MORE
THAN
A
CARS
LOOKS
OR
HANDELING
CONSIDER
IT
INSURANCE
IT
MAY
NOT
HAPPEN
OFTEN
BUT
WHEN
IT
DOES
YOULL
SURE
BE
GLAD
YOU
GOT
A
SAFE
CAR
GRANTED
THE
TESTS
ARENT
PERFECT
BUT
ID
MUCH
RATHER
BE
IN
A
CAR
THAT
DID
WELL
IN
THE
TEST
THAN
A
CAR
THAT
DID
HORRIBLY
YOU
RAISE
A
VALID
POINT
BUT
AGAIN
ITS
A
TRADEOFF
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
SPEND
FOR
THAT
KIND
OF
PROTECTION
YOU
COULD
BUY
A
VOLVO
SAAB
OR
BENZ
AND
GET
REALLY
GOOD
CRASH
PROTECTION
AND
OTHER
LUXURIES
BUT
YOULL
PAY
SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE
FOR
IT
IN
MY
CASE
ITS
OUT
OF
THE
QUESTION
BECAUSE
ALL
OF
THOSE
CARS
ARE
BEYOND
MY
BUDGET
EVEN
IN
HIGHSPEED
HEADON
COLLISIONS
THE
MOST
BENEFICIAL
ITEM
YOU
CAN
HAVE
IS
A
GOOD
OLD
SEATBELT
NOWADAYS
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
US
YOU
GET
AN
AIRBAG
IF
YOU
GET
A
BELT
SO
PRESUMABLY
YOU
GET
AN
ADDED
SAFETY
BENEFIT
THERE
AS
WELL
THATS
SOMETHING
I
CERTAINLY
LOOK
FOR
AND
WHICH
CAN
BE
HAD
IN
INEXPENSIVE
CARS

OF
COURSE
