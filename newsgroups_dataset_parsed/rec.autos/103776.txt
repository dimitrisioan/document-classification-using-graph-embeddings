EVE
I
AM
LOOKING
TO
BUY
NEW
TIRES
R
OR
HR
I
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
TO
SPEND
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
A
TIRE
THAT
WILL
LAST
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THE
FOLLOWING
BRANDS
RIKEN
FALKEN
BFG
GENERAL
THERE
ARE
OTHERS
BUT
THESE
I
CAN
FIND
HERE
FOR
UNDER
LIKE
I
SAID
I
AM
MOSTLY
INTERESTED
IN
THREADWEAR
THEN
SPEED
SINCE
I
HARDLY
GET
TO
DRIVE
THEM
OVER
OR
MPH
ALSO
IS
IT
TRUE
THAT
NOONE
WILL
GIVE
YOU
WARRANTY
ON
SUCH
TIRES
ACCORDING
TO
A
TIRE
DEALER
FINALLY
DO
HR
TIRES
LAST
LONGER
THAN
R
TIRES
THREADWEAR

OR
IS
THAT
STRICTLY
A
SPEED
FACTOR
THANKS

ANY
REPLIES
