HONDA
ACCORD
BRAKE
PROBLEM
MY
HONDA
ACCORD
JUST
HIT
THE
MAGIC
MILE
MARK
AND
NOW
ALL
SORTS
OF
THINGS
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
GO
BAD
THE
LATEST
PROBLEM
I
AM
EXPERIENCING
IS
WITH
MY
BRAKES
THEY
STILL
STOP
THE
CAR
FINE
BUT
ONCE
I
AM
STOPPED
COMPLETELY
MY
BRAKE
PEDAL
WILL
SINK
ANOTHER
OR
INCHES
ALL
BY
ITSELF
IF
FEELS
REALLY
STRANGE
AND
I
AM
WORRIED
MY
BRAKES
WILL
QUIT
WORKING
ONE
OF
THESE
DAYS
I
CHECKED
MY
BRAKE
FLUID
AND
THE
RESERVOIR
WAS
FULL
BUT
THE
FLUID
ITSELF
LOOKED
REALLY
DIRTY
LIKE
DIRTY
OIL
I
CALLED
MY
MECHANIC
AND
HE
TOLD
ME
I
NEED
A
NEW
BRAKE
MASTER
CYLINDER
WHICH
WILL
COST
ME
A
WHOPPING
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HAS
EXPERIENCED
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
IF
SO
IS
MY
MECHANIC
BEING
HONEST
OR
DO
I
SIMPLY
NEED
TO
HAVE
MY
BRAKES
BLED
AND
NEW
FLUID
PUT
IN
ANY
HELP
YOU
COULD
PROVIDE
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
PLEASE
SEND
REPLIES
DIRECTLY
TO
ME
AS
I
RARELY
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
READ
THIS
LIST
I
WILL
POST
THE
RESPONSES
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
INTEREST
THANKS
