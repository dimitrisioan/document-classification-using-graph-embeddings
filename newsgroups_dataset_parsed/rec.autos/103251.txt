sorry
for
the
misspelling
but
i
forgot
how
to
spell
it
after
my
series
of
exams
and
noon
hand
reference
here
is
it
still
possible
to
get
those
cute
wwii
vw
jeepwannabes
a
replica
would
be
great
i
think
greetings
you
may
be
in
luck
i
seem
to
recall
seeing
a
blurb
in
one
of
the
kit
car
magazines
about
a
company
in
norway
who
pulled
a
mould
sp
off
a
real
kubel
and
has
adapted
it
to
the
beetle
floorpan
as
for
the
suspension
all
i
can
remember
about
the
vw
thing
i
used
to
own
is
that
it
had
about
more
suspension
travel
than
a
stock
beetle
but
id
heard
that
there
were
after
market
parts
for
offroad
use
that
were
as
good
or
better
note
that
the
major
difference
looks
wise
between
a
kubel
a
thing
are
the
hood
and
the
fenders
the
kubel
had
an
external
spare
mounted
on
the
hood
and
the
hood
sloped
down
for
visibility
sharply
and
had
rounded
fenders
the
thing
has
a
lightly
sloped
hood
with
the
spare
mounted
inside
unless
moved
to
make
for
more
luggage
space
and
has
halfhexagon
shaped
fenders
imagine
a
nut
large
enough
to
put
a
tire
in
and
cut
off
the
bottom
half
of
it
unfortunately
i
dont
have
that
info
anymore
try
stopping
at
a
local
bookstore
and
copying
down
the
phone
numbers
for
the
two
big
mags
and
calling
them
they
might
be
able
to
get
the
number
for
you
dont
forget
to
calculate
the
time
difference
to
norway
before
calling
later
kc
a
quick
bones
help
me
