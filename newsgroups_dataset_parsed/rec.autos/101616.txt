the
nice
thing
about
real
platinum
plugs
is
that
you
dont
have
to
change
them
very
often
at
all
i
think
like
miles
they
might
cost
each
but
they
would
save
for
themselves
in
the
long
run
my
tbird
scs
manual
says
to
replace
the
platinum
plugs
every
walmart
has
autolite
platinum
plugs
for
each
are
these
real
platinum
plugs
i
had
bosch
platinums
in
my
fiesta
and
my
dad
had
em
in
his
bronconote
the
keyword
had
they
didnt
last
very
long
much
less
than
before
they
had
to
be
replaced
i
agree
that
they
werent
the
greatest
