wharfie
says
that
shows
how
much
you
know
about
anything
the
brakes
on
the
sho
are
very
different
inch
or
i
forget
discs
all
around
vented
in
front
the
normal
taurus
setup
is
smaller
discs
front
drums
rear
one
i
saw
had
vented
rears
tooit
was
on
a
lot
of
course
the
sales
man
was
a
fooltitanium
wheelsyeah
right
then
later
told
me
they
were
magnesiummore
believable
but
still
crap
since
al
is
so
m
uch
cheaper
and
just
as
good
i
tend
to
agree
tho
that
this
still
doesnt
take
the
sho
up
to
standard
for
running
on
a
regular
basis
the
brakes
should
be
bigger
like
or
sotake
a
look
at
the
ones
on
the
corradoswhere
they
have
braking
regulations
well
lets
seemy
tbird
sc
has
a
computercontrolled
adjustable
suspension
abs
disks
vented
front
rear
rears
also
vented
belts
sturdy
passenger
compartment
aerodynamics
good
enough
for
nascar
without
too
much
change
ftlb
supercharged
independent
suspension
plus
limitedslip
differential
with
a
top
speed
in
excess
of
and
rides
on
vrated
tires
i
have
yet
to
find
in
any
other
speed
rating
is
that
up
to
standard
if
not
why
not
james
i
really
hate
to
do
this
but
try
reading
the
damn
posts
then
you
shouldntve
done
it
try
answering
the
damn
question
i
am
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
mention
of
the
sc
in
there
never
was
a
tbird
mentioned
the
discussion
was
about
shos
and
stangs
not
being
up
to
spec
i
do
not
know
about
tbirds
i
only
know
that
the
specs
quoted
for
the
sho
by
previous
poster
sounded
a
little
anemic
for
me
to
say
that
it
was
up
to
snuff
this
does
not
kn
any
way
disencourage
me
from
wishing
to
own
one
nor
does
it
make
it
a
bad
car
it
merely
means
that
i
think
ford
could
have
added
that
extra
bit
of
safety
and
tossed
in
larger
brakes
as
the
wheels
are
plenty
large
enough
for
them
to
fit
if
memory
serves
right
which
it
may
very
well
not
and
the
motor
plenty
powerful
enough
to
need
it
well
my
point
was
that
the
sc
and
the
sho
both
have
very
similar
characteristics
front
and
rear
disks
abs
on
the
sho
high
output
independent
suspension
very
good
aerodynamics
harness
fat
rubber
and
top
speed
if
one
of
them
is
up
to
standard
and
i
think
the
sc
is
but
the
other
isnt
then
why
is
that
no
flamage
just
curiousity
