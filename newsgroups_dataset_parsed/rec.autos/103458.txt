anyone
else
experiencing
a
similar
problem
this
concerns
the
clutch
on
a
honda
accord
speed
when
the
clutch
is
first
used
in
the
morning
about
the
first
miles
of
shifting
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
clutch
chatter
until
things
warm
up
then
the
clutch
shifts
smoothly
this
chatter
started
when
i
moved
to
the
san
francisco
bay
area
from
a
lowhumidity
environment
the
dealer
stated
that
this
is
known
to
happen
since
honda
changed
from
an
asbestos
to
nonasbestos
clutch
material
no
remedy
seems
that
moisture
on
clutch
surface
causes
slipping
until
the
moisture
evaporates
any
comments
out
there
i
have
been
having
problems
with
a
slightly
different
clutch
problem
on
my
prelude
see
recautostech
for
more
detail
my
problem
is
a
false
engagement
point
below
the
actual
one
it
also
seems
affected
by
weather
it
is
most
noticeable
and
annoying
on
damp
or
cold
days
my
dealer
says
he
cant
reproduce
the
problem
i
think
ill
just
sell
the
car
