car
alarms
which
one
before
we
get
into
another
discussion
on
the
relative
merits
of
a
car
alarm
lets
go
on
the
assumption
that
one
is
desired
the
question
then
remains
which
one
ive
owned
a
hornet
and
was
satisfied
but
not
enough
to
get
another
for
my
new
car
the
alpine
has
been
highly
recommended
but
what
about
clifford
and
vses
derringer
any
others
i
want
all
of
the
standard
stuff
door
lock
interface
starter
kill
light
flash
led
valet
mode
passiveactive
shockmotion
sensor
etc
thanks
for
the
advice
