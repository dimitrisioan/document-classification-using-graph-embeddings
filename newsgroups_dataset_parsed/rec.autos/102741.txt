WRITES
WHILE
TAKING
AN
EXTENDED
EASTER
VACATION
I
WAS
GOING
NORTH
ON
SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN
CENTERVILLE
TX
AND
DALLAS
TX
AND
I
CAME
UPON
A
TRAIN
PARKED
ON
A
TRESTLE
WITH
ITS
LOCOMOTIVE
SITTING
DIRECTLY
OVER
THE
NORTHBOUND
LANES
THERE
APPEARED
TO
BE
MOVEMENT
WITHIN
THE
CAB
AND
OUT
OF
CURIOSITY
I
SLOWED
TO
TO
GET
A
BETTER
LOOK
JUST
AS
I
PASSED
FROM
UNDERNEATH
THE
TRESTLE
MY
RADAR
DETECTOR
WENT
INTO
FULL
ALERT
ALL
LIGHTS
LIT
AND
ALL
CHIRPS
BEEPS
AND
BUZZES
GOING
STRONG
I
THOUGHT
I
HAD
BEEN
NAILED
GOOD
BUT
NO
POLICE
MATERIALIZED
SOME
BUT
NOT
ALL
LOCOMOTIVES
HAVE
DOPPLER
SPEEDOMETERS
THE
RADAR
HEAD
IS
MOUNTED
LOOKING
DOWN
AT
THE
GROUND
TO
MINIMIZE
INTEREFERENCE
SENT
AND
RECEIVED
BUT
LOOKING
TANGENTALLY
AT
A
WHEEL
THESE
ARE
LOW
POWER
UNITS
AND
TYPICALLY
WONT
TRIGGER
RADAR
DETECTORS
UNLESS
AN
UNUSUAL
SITUATION
SUCH
AS
YOURS
ARISES

THIS
MAKES
SENSERADAR
POINTED
DOWN
BECAUSE
ALMOST
EVERY
TRAIN
I
PASS
HEADON
THAT
TRIGGERS
MY
RADAR
DETECTOR
DOES
SO
MORE
JUST
AFTER
I
HAVE
PASSED
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
ENGINE
I
GET
A
LITTLE
OF
THE
REFLECTIONS
AS
I
AM
APPROACHING
AND
THE
INSTANT
I
GET
TO
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
FIRST
ENGINE
THE
DETECTOR
RECEIVES
A
FAIRLY
STRONG
SIGNAL
FOR
A
SHORT
TIME
IT
HAPPENS
WITH
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
TRAIN
I
SEE
