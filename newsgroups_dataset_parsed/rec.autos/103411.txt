BMW
I
LOOKED
AT
THAT
BIMMER
YESTERDAY
ITS
AN
HAS
ABOUT
ACCORDING
TO
OWNER
ODOMETER
STOPPED
WORKING
AT
DRIVESS
WELL
SOUNDS
GOOD
BODY
IS
OK
HE
WANTS
I
LIKED
THE
CAR
DESPITE
ITS
AUTO
TRANNY
BUT
MY
WIFE
WILL
BE
A
PRIMARY
DRIVER
ON
THIS
ONE
AND
SHE
WANTS
AUTO
THE
RADIO
DOES
NOT
WORK
UNTILL
THE
CAR
WARMS
UP
AND
YOU
HONK
THE
HORN
THE
AC
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
A
LEAK
THE
SUNROOF
IS
STICKY
BUT
OPERATIONAL
ODOMETER
DOES
NOT
WORK
AS
MENTIONED
BEFORE
IDLE
IS
A
BIT
BOUNCY
GOING
FROM
TO
WIPERS
ARE
SLOW
THATS
TEH
GRIPES
THE
OWNER
SAYS
THAT
HE
CHANGED
RADIATOR
ALTERNATOR
ROTORS
AND
CALIPERS
EXHAUST
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
OWNER
IS
A
SHIFTY
SOB
TELLING
STRANGE
STORIES
I
HATE
THAT
I
WOULD
NEVER
BUY
FROM
A
PERSOM
LIKE
THAT
EXCEPT
HOW
OFTEN
YOU
SEE
A
DESCENT
FOR
THAT
AMOUNT
OF
MONEY
HE
ALSO
SAID
THAT
ALTHOUGH
I
COULD
BRING
A
MECHANICIN
HE
WOULDNT
LET
ME
CHECK
THE
CAR
BY
TAKING
IT
TO
A
GARAGE
SUSPICIOUS
AND
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
MILAGE
IS
ON
IT
SO
LET
ME
KNOW
WHAT
TO
CHECK
FOR
GIVEN
THERES
PRACTICALLY
NO
RUST
I
KNOW
THERE
WAS
AN
ARTICLE
ON
IN
RD
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
ANYBODY
REMEMBERS
WHAT
ISSUE
MIKES
