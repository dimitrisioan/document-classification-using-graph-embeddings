not
talking
about
bronco
iis
im
referring
to
the
broncos
that
began
production
in
based
on
the
chassis
i
believe
ahh
broncos
well
personally
i
have
a
the
blue
book
is
just
a
hair
over
grand
i
bought
it
for
and
then
bought
new
tires
front
end
rebuild
carb
rebuild
then
i
did
the
unthinkable
and
blew
the
engine
not
bronco
specific
unmaintained
engine
with
more
bucks
there
now
it
is
in
nice
condition
well
after
new
seats

of
a
tbird
radio
amps
speakers
alarm
well
the
radio
and
amps
were
free
and
i
bought
the
speakers
used
for
bucks
and
the
other
speakers
i
took
out
of
my
old
jeep
sell
a
jeep
for
a
bronco
you
might
ask
but
it
was
a
wagoneer
its
a
lovely
specimen
solid
front
and
rear
axels
ford
and
a
dana
up
front
watch
the
rear
axel
wrap
i
busted
off
my
ubolts
once
i
added
traction
shocks
after
that
and
havent
had
a
problem
since
also
the
bottom
of
the
doors
tend
to
rot
bottom
of
the
tailgates
likes
to
rust
right
up
to
the
new
ones
that
might
be
in
your
budget
the
post
broncos
have
that
sickly
ttb
front
end
and
little
stamped
and
folded
steel
radius
arms
were
as
the
have
nice
big
cast
iron
longer
radius
armsie
more
prspective
wheel
travel
the
only
rust
i
have
is
on
my
doors
and
a
few
dings
in
the
sheet
metal
i
dont
know
when
the
removeable
tops
were
discontinued
but
they
are
fun
i
just
ordered
a
full
convertable
top
for
for
minecredit
card
dont
ever
break
the
window
if
you
have
the
double
laminated
bronzed
privacy
glass
in
your
cap
it
is
over
bucks
to
replace
my
bronco
also
does
pretty
good
offroad
i
havent
bottomed
out
my
suspension
yet
and
have
crossed
over
foot
deep
of
water
with
no
problems
handles
rocks
like
a
charm
too
one
problem
is
it
is
wide
and
you
sometimes
cant
follow
a
cj
or
a
toyota
between
two
rocks
or
trees
and
your
grandmother
will
have
a
hard
time
getting
up
into
it
bob
