how
to
set

new

many
people
want
to
set
up
mailing
lists
for
their
favorite
automotive
topics
rather
fewer
know
how
to
do
it
this
article
will
provide
the
essential
information
for
doing
so
on
standard
unix
systems
a
shell
script
and
examples
of
alias
file
setups
are
included
which
presently
run
on
a
sparc
here
at
balltowncmacom
for
a
number
of
mailing
lists
note
that
if
you
do
set
up
an
automotive
mailing
list
please
let
me
know
of
the
request
address
so
that
i
can
list
it
in
the
montly
recautos
posting
also
inform
the
keeper
of
the
usenet
listoflists
check
newsanswers
for
this
monthly
posting
first
of
all
to
get
anywhere
you
need
to
either
be
a
sysadmin
or
have
some
measure
of
assistance
from
your
sysadmin
it
is
also
important
that
you
have
reasonably
good
network
connectivity
if
it
seems
like
you
get
everything
several
days
after
anyone
else
or
that
you
have
trouble
getting
email
through
then
your
network
connectivity
is
probably
not
good
enough
listserv
there
is
a
handy
automated
mailing
list
package
named
listserv
which
is
available
from
several
ftp
servers
on
the
network
details
of
the
installation
and
operation
of
listserv
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
article
but
anyone
who
is
considering
running
a
large
mailing
list
should
probably
look
at
listserv
carefully
the
alias
file
on
a
typical
unix
system
there
is
a
file
named
usrlibaliases
on
whichever
file
server
is
your
mail
host
it
contains
lines
such
as
foo
bar
baz
bletch
which
means
that
any
email
sent
the
name
foo
on
that
host
is
redistributed
to
users
bar
baz
and
bletch
thus
the
simplest
possible
email
list
is
myfavoritecar
myaddress
myfavoritecarrequest
myaddress
this
has
a
couple
of
problems
the
most
noticeable
one
being
that
you
have
to
be
superuser
to
edit
the
alias
file
however
you
can
do
the
following
with
the
connivance
of
your
sysadmin
myfavoritecar
includehomemydirmiscautosmyfavoritecarlist
myfavoritecarrequest
myaddress
where
the
file
specified
is
a
list
of
comma
and
newline
separated
addresses
this
file
can
be
in
the
list
admins
home
directory
owned
by
the
list
admin
bounced
mail
this
still
has
a
problem
bounced
mail
usually
gets
distributed
to
all
the
members
of
the
list
which
is
generally
considered
somewhat
irritating
therefore
the
way
that
the
driving
school
mailing
list
is
set
up
is
instructive
thanks
to
harpal
chohan
of
the
bmw
list
for
this
setup
by
the
way
im
not
sure
where
he
got
it
from
schoolrequest
welty
schoolrebroadcast
includehomenewweltymiscautosschoollist
school
usrlocaladmbinexplscript
school
ownerschool
schoolrequest
ownerschoolout
schoolrequest
heres
what
is
going
on
here
the
owner
and
request
addresses
are
intended
as
traps
for
bounced
mail
coming
from
the
network
the
request
address
also
serves
as
the
point
of
contact
for
administrative
duties
school
is
what
people
send
mail
to
instead
of
pointing
at
addresses
it
points
at
a
shell
script
which
rewrites
headers
before
resending
the
email
schoolbroadcast
of
which
nobody
except
me
knows
the
name
the
name
has
been
changed
here
to
protect
my
own
sanity
points
at
the
actual
list
members
the
shell
script
i
use
is
as
follows
binsh
cd
tmp
sed
e
replytod
e
senderd
e
from
d
echo
replyto
echo
errorsto
echo
sender
cat
usrlibsendmail
om
f
f
the
mailing
list
exit
note
that
this
script
does
not
know
the
name
of
the
list
the
name
is
passed
in
from
outside
so
that
the
script
may
be
used
for
multiple
lists
i
run
several
out
of
this
site
the
script
excises
replyto
sender
and
from
lines
from
the
incoming
message
substitutes
for
sender
and
replyto
and
adds
errorsto
of
all
email
bounce
messages
end
up
being
sent
to
the
request
or
owner
addresses
if
this
header
rewrite
is
done
for
digested
lists
there
is
some
digestification
software
around
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
provide
more
information
in
a
future
