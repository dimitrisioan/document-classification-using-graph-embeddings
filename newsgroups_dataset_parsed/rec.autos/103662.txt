hi
ive
been
seeing
all
these
articles
about
changing
brake
fluid
and
i
am
wondering
if
this
is
really
necessary
i
have
an
toyota
corolla
with
and
i
am
in
the
process
of
doing
preventative
maintenance
and
i
was
wondering
if
this
was
something
that
i
should
add
to
my
list
of
things
to
do
any
information
would
be
greatly
appreciated
i
really
love
this
car
and
would
like
to
keep
it
for
as
long
as
possible
thanx
lisa
sign
me
only
a
manual
will
do
amplifying
on
jeff
gosss
answer
the
absorbed
water
will
rust
your
brakelines
and
master
cylinder
and
calipers
and
you
could
suddenly
lose
all
your
brake
fluid
