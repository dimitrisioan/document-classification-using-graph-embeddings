the
chevrolet
brothers
were
respected
racers
test
drivers
for
the
buick
co
when
durant
was
there
when
the
directors
kicked
durant
out
of
gm
in
he
took
chevrolet
and
others
with
him
as
mentioned
before
they
founded
the
successful
chevrolet
company
a
littleknown
fact
is
that
the
chevrolet
co
actually
took
over
gm
that
was
how
durant
got
back
in
charge
of
gm
legally
his
new
company
chevrolet
co
did
the
buying
and
gm
was
a
division
of
chevrolet
after
and
into
the
sloan
era
gm
shuffled
things
so
that
the
gm
board
was
superior
but
there
was
always
a
degree
of
autonomy
given
the
chevy
division
presumably
because
of
the
initial
structure
if
you
look
at
the
organization
chart
for
gm
in
sloans
book
chevy
division
reports
directly
to
floor
not
through
the
passenger

division
which
covers
