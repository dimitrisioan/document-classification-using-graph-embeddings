improvements
in
automatic
transmissions
the
biggest
hurdle
for
automatics
imho
is
not
shifting
speed
per
se
but
rather
the
transmissions
reaction
speed
when
you
try
to
force
it
to
shift
manually
this
was
the
biggest
fault
with
the
subaru
ecvt
it
took
soooooo
lonnnnnnnnggggg
for
the
tranny
to
find
the
right
ratio
the
sales
propaganda
says
the
saturn
automatic
is
effectively
an
electronicallyshifted
manual
might
this
mean
that
saturn
has
conquered
the
problem
i
dunno
only
driven
saturn
input
please
another
question
any
plans
for
a
manualtrans
chrysler
lh
does
anyone
else
out
there
fall
asleep
at
night
dreaming
of
this
combo
