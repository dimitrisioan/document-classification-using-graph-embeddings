FOO
BRAD
THONE
WRITES
WELL
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
I
DONT
HAPPEN
TO
HAVE
MY
SAE
MANUAL
HANDY
BUT
OIL
VISCOSITY
IN
GENERAL
DECREASES
WITH
TEMPERATURE
THE
SAE
NUMBERS
ARE
BASED
ON
A
TYPICAL
CURVE
THAT
OILS
USED
TO
ALL
HAVE
RUNNING
FROM
SAY
THE
VISCOSITY
OF
A
ROOMTEMPERATURE
AT
DOWN
TO
SAY
THAT
OF
A
ROOMTEMPERATURE
AT
FOR
A
TYPICAL
OIL
OILS
THAT
ARE
DESIGNED
FOR
OPERATION
IN
NORMAL
TEMPERATURES
JUST
HAVE
A
WEIGHT
SPECIFICATION
OILS
THAT
ARE
DESIGNED
FOR
OPERATION
IN
EXCEEDINGLY
COLD
TEMPERATURES
HAVE
A
W
TACKED
ON
THE
END
SO
IN
WINTER
IN
A
COLD
PLACE
YOUD
STICK
IN
YOUR
CAR
IN
THE
WINTER
AND
IN
IT
IN
THE
SUMMER
TO
APPROXIMATE
THE
APPROPRIATE
VISCOSITY
THROUGHOUT
THE
YEAR
MODERN
MULTIVISCOSITY
OILS
CHANGE
VISCOSITY
MUCH
LESS
WITH
TEMPERATURE
AS
A
RESULT
THEIR
VISCOSITY
GRAPHS
CROSS
OVER
SEVERAL
CURVES
A
MULTIVIS
SPECIFICATION
PEGS
THE
CURVE
AT
TWO
TEMPERATURES
A
NORMAL
OPERATING
TEMPERATURE
AND
A
COLD
ONE
THOUGH
I
CANT
REMEMBER
THE
NUMBERS
IN
ANY
EVENT
THE
WEIGHTS
DO
INDICATE
A
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
REMEMBER
THAT
YOUR
ENGINE
IS
TEMPERATUREREGULATED
BY
THE
THERMOSTAT
AND
RADIATOR
OR
AIR
FINS
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
UNLESS
YOU
OVERHEAT
IT
OR
SOMETHING
ANY
WEIGHT
OF
OIL
IS
BETTER
THAN
NO
OIL
OR
THAN
VERY
OLD
CARBONIZED
OIL
THIN
OIL
WONT
IN
GENERAL
LUBRICATE
AS
WELL
AT
TEMPERATURE
THICKER
OIL
WILL
LIKE
A
WILL
LUBRICATE
BETTER
AT
TEMPERATURE
BUT
NOT
AS
WELL
DURING
STARTUP
WHEN
MOST
ENGINE
WEAR
OCCURS
IF
YOURE
PLANNING
ON
MAKING
LONG
DRIVES
THE
IS
PROBABLY
FINE
ESP
IN
THE
SUMMER
IN
YOUR
CAR
BUT
IF
YOURE
MAKING
SHORT
DRIVES
STICK
TO
THE
DONT
DRINK
SOAP
DILUTE
DILUTE
OK
