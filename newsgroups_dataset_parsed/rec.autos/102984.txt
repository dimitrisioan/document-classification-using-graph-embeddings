just
last
week
the
pbs
show
motor
week
gave
the
results
of
what
they
thought
were
the
best
cars
for
in
the
convertible
category
the
honda
civic
del
sol
achieved
this
honor
the
one
downside
i
see
with
the
car
is
its
interior
it
looks
inexpensive
and
dull
i
own
a
del
sol
and
i
must
vouch
for
the
interior
i
really
looks
snazzy
when
the
top
is
off
i
looks
a
lot
better
in
person
than
on
the
television
i
saw
that
motorweek
as
well
needless
to
say
i
was
smiling
a
bit
by
the
time
it
was
over
watch
out
for
that
darned
convertible
tan
