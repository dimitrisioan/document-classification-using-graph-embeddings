THE
QUALITY
OF
AUTOBAHNS
IS
SOMETHING
OF
A
MYTH
THE
ROAD
SURFACE
ISNT
MUCH
DIFFERENT
TO
A
TYPICAL
TX
FREEWAY
THEY
ARE
BETTER
IN
TERMS
OF
LIGHTING
SAFETY
SIGNS
ROADMARKINGS
ETC
THEY
LIGHT
THE
HIGHWAYS
IN
TEXAS
FUNNY
EVERYWHERE
ELSE
IVE
BEEN
THEY
ONLY
LIGHT
EM
AT
JUNCTIONS
I
WONT
EVEN
GET
INTO
HOW
MUCH
ROAD
MARKINGS
VARY
BETWEEN
STATES
AND
LOCALITIES
EXCEPT
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
AREAS
WHERE
MARKINGS
ARE
ESSENTIALLY
NONEXISTANT
THAN
MOST
OF
THE
ROADS
HERE
A
DIP
IN
THE
ASPHALT
THAT
YOU
TEST
YOUR
SHOCKS
ON
AT
WILL
KILL
YOU
AT
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
LOVE
TO
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
QUITE
SEVERE
I
DONT
RECALL
ANY
US
FREEWAY
WITHOUT
ROAD
DAMAGE
WARNINGS
THAT
I
WOULD
REGARD
AS
UNSAFE
AT
IN
ANY
DECENT
WELL
DAMPED
CAR
I
SUSPECT
YOU
HAVE
VERY
LIMITED
EXPERIENCE
US
FREEWAYS
VARY
DRAMATICALLY
PARTICULARLY
BETWEEN
STATES
I
CAN
NAME
A
NUMBER
OF
INTERSTATE
HIGHWAYS
IN
VARIOUS
PARTS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
WHERE
WOULD
BE
VERY
OPTIMISTIC
IN
ANY
CAR
IM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
CALL
QUITE
SEVERE
IN
TERMS
OF
ROAD
DEVIATIONS
BUT
I
SUSPECT
EVERY
SINGLE
BRIDGE
JUNCTION
ON
THROUGH
CT
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
SO
THEYRE
HARD
TO
TAKE
AT
THATS
NOT
THE
ONLY
INTERSTATE
IVE
SEEN
WITH
SUCH
DEVIATIONS
BUT
ITS
ONE
I
DRIVE
FREQUENTLY
TEXAS
IS
PRETTY
MUCH
AN
EDGECASE
YOU
CANT
ASSUME
THAT
EVERYWHERE
HAS
ROADS
IN
SUCH
GOOD
CONDITION
SUCH
FLAT
TERRAIN
AND
SUCH
WIDEOPEN
SPACES
IT
JUST
