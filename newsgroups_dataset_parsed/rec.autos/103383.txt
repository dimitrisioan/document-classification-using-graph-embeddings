JAMES
P
CALLISON
WRITES
WHY
ANYONE
WOULD
ORDER
AN
SHO
WITH
AN
AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION
IS
BEYOND
ME
IF
YOU
CANT
HANDLE
A
STICK
YOU
SHOULD
STICK
WITH
A
REGULAR
TAURUS
AND
LEAVE
THE
SHO
TO
REAL
DRIVERS
THAT
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
ARENT
REAL
DRIVERS
WHO
CANT
USE
THE
STICK
EG
DISABLED
PERSONS
BUT
THEY
ARENT
IN
ANY
POSITION
TO
USE
AN
SHO
ANYWAY
ACTUALLY
DISABLED
PERSONS
HAVE
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
DRIVE
IN
SCCA
RACES
ID
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
MAKING
SWEEPING
GENERALIZATIONS
HERE
ID
PREFER
A
MANUAL
TRANSMISSION
BUT
THE
EARLY
SHO
HAD
AN
AWFUL
TRANSMISSION
THAT
FELT
LIKE
IT
CAME
OUT
OF
A
TRUCK
OR
SOMETHING
IT
WAS
ALMOST
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
ME
WANT
AN
AUTOMATIC
