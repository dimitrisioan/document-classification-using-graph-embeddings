WRITES
THIS
HAS
ME
THINKING
IS
THERE
A
BIOLOGICAL
REASON
WHY
WOMEN
CANT
PUT
THEIR
KEYS
IN
THEIR
PANTS
POCKETS
LIKE
MEN
DO
I
HAVE
TWO
POCKETS
ON
THE
BACK
OF
EACH
OF
MY
PANTS
I
PUT
MY
KEYS
IN
ONE
AND
WALLENT
IN
ANOTHER
MANY
OF
THE
POCKETS
EVEN
HAVE
A
BOTTON
ON
THEM
SO
I
CAN
CLOSE
THEM
SECURELY
EVERYTHING
IS
THAT
MUCH
SIMPLER
FOR
ME
WHY
CANT
WOMEN
DO
THE
SAME
IS
IS
BIOLOGICAL
IE
NOT
ENOUGH
ROOM
FOR
A
BIGGER
BOTTOM
PLUS
KEYS
AND
A
WALLET
OR
IS
IT
THE
WAY
THEY
ARE
RAISED
BY
THE
PARENTS
IVE
FOUND
THAT
IT
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
THE
WAY
WOMENS
CLOTHES
ARE
MADE
IF
YOU
PUT
KEYS
IN
THE
FRONT
POCKET
OF
WOMENS
JEANS
OR
SLACKS
YOU
GET
A
BULGE
THAT
ALSO
TENDS
TO
MAKE
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
SIT
DOWN
BECAUSE
THEY
STICK
YOU
CONSTANTLY
DITTO
IN
THE
BACK
POCKET
ALSO
TRY
LOOKING
AT
THE
BACK
POCKETS
OF
WOMENS
JEANS
AND
COMPARE
THEM
TO
THE
BACK
POCKETS
ON
MENS
JEANS
THEY
ARE
USUALLY
IF
YOU
BUY
JEANS
THAT
YOU
EXPECT
TO
LAST
FOR
ANY
LENGTH
OF
TIME
ABOUT
HALF
THE
SIZE
THERE
FLAT
OUT
ISNT
ROOM
FOR
A
WALLET
OR
A
BUNCH
OF
KEYS
BESIDES
WHICH
WHERE
WOULD
MEN
PUT
ALL
THEIR
CRAP
IF
THEIR
WIVES
DIDNT
CARRY
PURSES
THE

PLACE
