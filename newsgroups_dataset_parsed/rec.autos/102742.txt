QUESTION
I
CONSULTED
WITH
SOMEONE
WORKING
ON
AN
ELECTRONIC
ODOMETER
THE
DESIGN
WAS
TO
USE
A
MICROPROCESSOR
BASED
SYSTEM
TO
WRITE
A
SOMEWHAT
OFUSCATED
PATTERN
INTO
AN
EEPROM
THE
IDEA
WAS
TO
MAKE
THE
CIRCUIT
DIFFICULT
TO
PROGRAM
ARBITRARY
VALUES
INTO
THE
EEPROM
THE
SECONDARY
PURPOSE
ACUTALLY
THE
PRIMARY
PURPOSE
FROM
THE
STANDPOINT
OF
PRACTICALITY
WAS
TO
DISTRIBUTED
THE
WRITES
SO
AS
TO
AVOID
EXCEEING
THE
MAXIMUM
NUMBER
OF
WRITES
FOF
THE
EEPROM
BEING
USED
THE
MICROPROCESSOR
ALSO
IGNORED
PULSES
COMING
FROM
THE
HALL
EFFECT
AT
A
RATE
ANY
HIGHER
THAN
MPH
SO
AS
TO
MAKE
SPOOFING
THE
READING
BY
BENCH
PULSING
AT
LEAST
SOMEWHAT
UNDESIRABLE
THIS
WAS
FOR
AN
AUTOMOBILE
THAT
WAS
NOT
EXPECTED
TO
EVER
EXCEED
MPH
IN
OPERATION
THE
CASE
OF
COURSE
MIGHT
NOT
BE
THE
SAME
FOR
YOUR
THE
ECM
MODULES
OF
SOME

DO
INDEED
STORE
INFO
ABOUT
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
CARS
HAVE
BEEN
OPERATED
SINCE
STEERING
ANGLE
AND
VELOCITY
DATA
ETC
IS
AVAILABLE
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
COLLECT
ALL
SORTS
OF
INTERESTING
DEMOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
DRIVERS
USE
OF
THE
CAR
I
AM
NOT
AWARE
OF
ANY
MANUFACTURER
CURRENTLY
TRYING
TO
ENFORCE
WARRANTY
RESTRICTIONS
BASED
ON
READING
OUT
USE
DATA
FROM
THE
ECM
WHILE
IT
COULD
BE
A
POTENTIAL
INVASION
OF
YOUR
PRIVACY
FOR
MANUFACTURERS
TO
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
DATA
ABOUT
YOUR
DRIVING
STYLE
IT
COULD
ALSO
PROVIDE
VALUABLE
INFORMATION
FROM
ACTUAL
FIELD
USE
CONDITIONS
TO
HELP
ENGINEER
MORE
APPROPRIATE
CARS
I
PERSONALLY
WOULDNT
MIND
