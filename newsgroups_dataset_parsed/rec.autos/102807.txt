WRITES
SORRY
FOR
THE
AUTO
CONTENT
BUT
THAT
IS
WHY
LOWABIDING
CITIZENS
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES
AND
THEIR
PROPERTY
USING
DEADLY
FORCE
IF
NECESSARY
ANYWHERE
A
THREAT
IS
IMMINENT
STEVE
HERACLEOUS
YOU
DO
HAVE
THE

STEVE
YOU
CAN
DO
IT
WHY
DONT
YOU
WHY
DONT
YOU
GO

A
TRUE
STATEMENT
OF
THE

I
WOULD
SAY
WHAT
LAWABIDING
NOT
LOWABIDING
AS

TALK
ABOUT
FREUDIAN
SLIPS
CITIZENS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
AND
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
DO
IS
TRY
TO
PREVENT
THIS
TYPE
OF
BEHAVIOUR
IN
CHILDREN
A
DOCTOR
MAY
HAVE
TO
USE
DEADLY
FORCE
AGAINST
A
PART
OF
A
BODY
LIKE
AMPUTATING
IT
WHEN
AN
INFECTIONDISEASE
HAS
GONE
TOO
FAR
BUT
HIS
REAL
DESIRE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TO
PREVENT
THE
