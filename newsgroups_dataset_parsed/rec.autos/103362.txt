review
of
ford
taurus
sho
by
gene
kim
background
last
week
i
bought
a
ford
taurus
sho
moving
up
from
driving
a
toyota
celica
st
and
a
oldsmobile
cutlass
i
have
been
interested
in
buying
a
sho
for
about
five
months
and
have
been
combing
the
classifieds
in
denver
and
chicago
every
week
i
bought
a
remarkably
clean
maroonred
sho
with
miles
on
it
for
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
about
under
blue
book
and
i
still
have
another
miles
before
the
extended
service
plan
runs
out
as
one
should
with
any
shos
i
made
sure
that
the
car
was
already
refit
with
the
upgraded
clutch
and
pressure
plate
as
well
as
having
been
recalled
for
upgraded
rotors
and
seatbelt
attachments
however
my
sho
does
not
have
the
newer
rod
shifter
i
understand
i
can
get
this
for
from
any
ford
service
center
in
addition
the
car
received
the
full
tuneup
at
miles
receiving
new
platinum
plugs
and
valve
adjustment
for
a
car
with
miles
on
it
the
car
was
virtually
immaculate
the
clearcoat
paint
job
was
devoid
of
any
large
chips
or
dents
although
the
front
airdammolding
was
covered
with
lots
of
small
scratches
not
surprising
since
most
of
the
miles
were
spent
on
the
highway
having
driven
a
smaller
twodoor
coupe
for
so
long
i
was
a
bit
concerned
about
whether
i
could
get
used
to
driving
a
larger
car
to
my
surprise
the
size
of
the
car
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
it
seems
just
as
nimble
as
my
celica
no
comparisons
with
my
oldsmobile
visibility
from
the
drivers
seat
is
excellent
helped
mostly
by
of
the
small
the
quarterwindows
aft
of
the
backseat
door
windows
and
in
front
of
the
cpillar
and
rear
window
parallel
parking
is
a
bit
more
difficult
but
other
than
that
i
love
the
size
in
fact
im
starting
to
appreciate
the
large
trunk
as
i
pack
up
for
a
drive
to
washington
dc
for
the
summer
more
on
the
ride
later
in
this
review
engine
as
with
anyone
even
slightly
interested
in
shos
i
was
very
interested
in
the
yamaha
shogun
engine
i
was
not
disappointed
base
performance
of
the
engine
under
rpms
is
good
you
can
even
do
reasonable
launches
from
second
gear
although
i
dont
make
a
practice
of
this
the
engine
revs
smoothly
and
eagerly
tooling
around
town
does
not
require
many
shifts
this
is
good
since
the
shifter
is
definitely
one
of
the
weakest
points
of
the
car
more
on
this
later
while
the
performance
of
the
engine
under
rpms
may
be
unremarkable
it
undergoes
a
jekyllhyde
transformation
once
you
hit
higher
revs
at
rpms
a
butterfly
valve
opens
and
you
can
literally
hear
and
feel
the
geometry
of
the
engine
changing
as
twelve
more
valves
open
up
the
engine
soars
to
its
rpm
redline
and
you
are
treated
to
in
my
opinion
the
sweetest
sounding
around
the
engine
inexplicably
sounds
overjoyed
to
be
at
rpm
ive
noticed
that
when
i
drive
around
town
i
constantly
watch
the
tach
to
see
how
far
below
rpm
i
am
to
go
from
rpm
to
you
may
have
to
punch
the
accelerator
while
torque
is
more
than
adequate
it
doesnt
come
fully
online
until
those
other
valves
are
used
transmission
when
car
and
driver
first
reviewed
the
car
in
they
marvelled
at
how
ford
had
put
such
a
wimpy
clutch
and
balky
shifter
into
the
car
i
remember
driving
a
friends
parents
sho
in
and
remember
thinking
about
whether
i
had
the
leg
strength
to
drive
the
car
in
traffic
the
clutch
was
that
stiff
that
was
back
then
the
entire
clutch
assembly
on
my
sho
has
been
replaced
under
a
ford
recall
in
the
clutch
on
the
sho
feels
no
stiffer
than
the
one
on
my
toyota
celica
in
fact
the
friction
point
seems
a
bit
larger
and
more
forgiving
when
playing
with
the
shifter
with
the
car
parked
the
shifter
felt
very
reasonable
the
and
gates
were
where
youd
expect
it
to
be
and
the
shifting
action
was
smooth
on
the
road
its
much
the
same
but
you
have
to
shift
slowly
make
no
mistake
its
a
clumsy
shifter
when
hurrying
shifts
like
when
i
was
initially
trying
to
impress
friends
i
consistently
miss
the
shift
often
grope
clumsily
for
the
shift
and
sometimes
even
muff
the
shift
i
find
this
pretty
amazing
in
a
car
like
this
it
also
took
me
several
days
to
realize
that
you
get
the
smoothest
shifts
when
you
take
your
time
seems
obvious
but
compared
to
my
toyota
and
my
friends
honda
this
seems
atrocious
and
clumsy
someone
on
recautos
noted
that
crxs
should
blow
shos
offtheline
because
of
the
incredibly
clumsy
shifter
i
now
shift
much
more
sedately
and
the
shifter
seems
more
reasonable
when
you
play
within
these
bounds
the
shifter
works
smoothly
with
no
surprises
i
dont
know
whether
the
rod
shifter
upgrade
would
help
at
all
along
these
same
lines
i
initially
had
trouble
shifting
gears
smoothly
again
slowing
down
the
shifts
and
taking
more
care
to
match
revs
when
letting
out
the
clutch
helped
immensely
this
took
several
days
for
me
to
get
the
hang
of
i
think
some
of
my
problems
were
because
ive
never
had
a
car
with
enough
power
to
balk
at
bad
shifts
in
higher
gears
occasionally
i
have
trouble
shifting
into
reverse
the
shifter
refuses
to
enter
the
gate
and
i
often
grind
the
synchros
trying
to
get
it
into
gear
ill
be
watching
this
carefully
in
the
next
couple
of
months
a
quirk
when
i
upshift
and
the
engine
drops
back
to
rpm
i
hear
a
whirring
and
then
a
grinding
noise
coming
from
the
the
engine
compartment
not
terribly
loud
but
the
passenger
can
definitely
hear
it
i
asked
about
it
when
i
was
looking
at
the
car
as
do
all
my
passengers
apparently
this
is
a
definitely
a
sho
sound
and
is
the
gearbox
apparently
called
gear
rollover
replies
to
my
queries
on
recautos
are
at
the
end
of
this
review
exterior
as
i
mentioned
before
i
am
astounded
by
how
well
the
body
of
this
sho
has
stood
up
paint
chipping
on
the
front
bumper
and
grille
are
virtually
nonexistent
looking
at
how
older
tauri
sometimes
dont
age
so
gracefully
i
wonder
what
the
guys
at
ford
did
differently
to
the
sho
bodies
the
body
in
my
opinion
is
extremely
attractive
with
matching
color
body
moldings
than
the
stock
tauri
for
some
odd
reason
the
sho
seems
different
enough
from
vanilla
tauri
to
get
stares
at
stoplights
of
course
this
could
be
my
overactive
imagination
shos
get
fog
lights
a
more
open
grille
a
completely
monochromatic
exterior
and
a
deeper
ground
skirt
in
the
back
with
sho
stenciled
in
relief
ive
seen
a
couple
shos
whose
owners
have
colored
these
in
with
florescent
colors
or
in
black
yuck
i
dont
think
the
car
is
flashy
i
like
it
that
way
i
feel
almost
anonymous
with
all
those
tauri
out
there
but
different
and
distinctive
enough
to
those
of
us
who
care
interior
the
interior
is
what
really
makes
me
feel
like
i
dont
deserve
the
car
the
seats
are
grey
leather
the
steering
wheel
and
shifter
are
covered
with
black
leather
and
the
entire
instrument
panel
is
done
in
a
blackgreymetallic
scheme
the
instrumentation
is
stock
taurus
except
for
the
mph
speedo
and
rpm
tach
you
get
a
center
console
with
two
cupholders
a
large
compartment
under
the
radio
great
for
a
cd
player
an
armrest
that
contains
yet
another
compartment
three
appropriately
sized
coin
holders
for
tollways
i
think
and
a
compartment
for
holding
cassette
tapes
theres
mapholders
in
the
doors
and
an
oddly
small
glove
compartment
i
spilled
a
whole
can
of
coke
in
the
cupholder
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
the
entire
rubber
holder
can
be
removed
and
washed
in
a
sink
hey
im
really
impressed
with
the
ergonomics
and
thoughtfulness
that
went
into
its
design
and
its
a
before
the
interior
was
upgraded
the
backseat
is
bigger
than
any
car
ive
had
why
do
they
need
so
much
space
no
smartass
comments
please
the
driver
and
passenger
seat
have
lumbar
and
side
bolsters
from
what
i
hear
its
not
uncommon
for
the
side
bolsters
to
show
wear
mine
is
no
exception
the
left
side
bolster
on
the
drivers
has
cracked
and
im
not
convinced
the
right
bolster
is
inflating
all
the
way
a
big
surprise
for
me
i
forgot
that
shos
dont
have
a
normal
hand
parking
brake
instead
they
have
the
regular
parking
brake
that
you
press
with
your
left
foot
too
bad
again
im
getting
used
to
it
but
it
seems
a
bit
anachronistic
to
me
ride
the
suspension
is
nice
and
stiff
too
stiff
its
stiffer
than
any
car
ive
had
a
friends
new
toyota
celica
st
seems
tauter
and
is
still
able
to
soak
up
bumps
better
the
sho
seems
stiffer
with
less
ability
to
soak
up
bumps
driving
over
railroad
tracks
is
a
noisy
and
jarring
affair
on
the
other
hand
taking
turns
feels
wonderful
because
the
body
is
so
rigid
and
doesnt
flex
at
all
i
listened
for
that
before
i
bought
the
car
on
the
highway
the
ride
is
great
when
i
drove
the
car
from
chicago
back
to
purdue
i
had
trouble
keeping
under
mph
let
alone
from
trying
to
see
what
mph
really
feels
like
its
a
relatively
quiet
ride
but
the
sunroof
rattles
ive
tried
to
find
out
what
exactly
makes
all
the
noise
up
there
but
it
seems
to
be
the
window
that
rests
on
the
rails
no
easy
way
to
get
rid
of
it
i
think
over
the
past
three
days
ive
oscillated
between
thinking
the
suspension
is
wonderful
and
perfect
and
thinking
that
the
ride
is
way
too
rough
not
for
me
mind
you
but
i
wonder
whether
i
would
advise
my
dad
to
buy
one
for
himself
but
ive
discovered
as
with
the
shifter
if
you
take
your
time
with
shifts
youll
have
no
reason
to
complain
let
me
explain
the
ride
is
worst
when
turning
and
applying
lots
of
power
to
the
wheels
i
feel
the
wheels
scrabbling
for
traction
and
torque
steer
making
the
car
skitter
left
and
right
after
i
understood
this
i
avoid
the
limits
of
traction
and
im
a
happy
camper
again
its
not
body
rigidity
but
the
composure
of
the
car
as
if
matching
the
suspension
the
steering
feel
is
quite
heavy
my
first
impression
of
driving
my
sho
was
how
hard
you
had
to
turn
the
wheel
at
highway
speeds
it
tracks
straight
as
an
arrow
but
when
driving
around
a
parking
lot
the
higheffort
steering
didnt
seem
so
useful
however
its
reasonable
but
it
doesnt
communicate
the
road
to
the
driver
as
well
as
a
ford
probe
gt
imho
its
much
better
than
the
steering
on
my
celica
st
i
wonder
how
bad
this
car
is
during
winter
miscellaneous
notes
gripes
the
rattles
from
the
sunroof
is
intermittent
some
days
it
rattles
loudly
other
days
i
look
up
wondering
where
all
the
noise
went
activating
the
sunroof
is
sometimes
very
noisy
loud
squealing
as
it
retracts
on
its
rails
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
quick
fix
for
this
again
other
days
it
completely
disappears
function
of
humidity
once
i
made
the
connection
between
the
sometimes
awful
feeling
suspension
and
torque
steer
ive
never
complained
about
ride
i
wish
the
seats
had
more
support
under
the
thighs
also
i
wish
the
side
bolsters
would
close
more
tightly
i
hear
that
tires
for
this
car
can
get
really
expensive
i
currently
have
goodyear
that
cost
the
previous
owner
for
four
i
used
to
hate
the
ford
stereo
systems
whose
idea
was
it
to
use
a
volume
paddle
now
to
my
amazement
i
dont
really
mind
and
sometimes
think
its
an
okay
idea
pretty
ridiculous
though
getting
up
to
rpm
sometimes
seems
to
be
a
chore
but
this
is
no
big
deal
there
is
more
than
enough
torque
down
low
i
often
goof
up
the
shifting
when
driving
with
friends
it
took
me
a
couple
of
days
before
i
could
really
shift
smoothly
from
to
gear
hard
to
believe
isnt
it
my
car
has
almost
miles
on
it
my
parents
noted
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
a
lowmileage
sho
astute
observation
imho
i
wonder
how
long
i
can
make
my
sho
last
i
just
bought
a
book
titled
drive
it
forever
for
tips
in
this
department
the
goofy
parking
brake
pedal
still
throws
me
for
a
loop
i
once
parked
the
car
in
gear
and
then
accidentally
let
out
the
clutch
after
i
started
it
the
car
jolted
forward
and
bounced
off
the
car
in
front
of
me
no
paint
damage
at
all
but
starting
the
car
is
a
whole
new
ritual
for
me
with
that
fangled
pedal
also
i
began
to
wonder
how
strong
that
brake
really
is
today
i
backed
out
of
parking
spot
today
and
started
to
drive
away
before
i
noticed
the
glowing
brake
light
oops
the
drivers
power
window
creaks
when
closed
all
the
way
the
same
thing
happens
in
my
parents
mercury
sable
oddly
all
the
other
windows
work
smoothly
likes
im
liking
the
interior
amenities
more
and
more
each
day
the
cupholders
are
great
i
didnt
expect
to
use
the
keyless
entry
buttons
so
much
but
it
really
is
handy
you
can
lock
all
the
doors
by
pressing
the
and
buttons
together
neat
and
you
can
never
lock
yourself
out
of
the
car
i
really
feel
like
i
dont
deserve
this
car
i
really
cant
believe
that
i
could
afford
it
i
got
this
car
ten
years
ahead
of
schedule
i
love
this
car
so
much
that
ive
been
telling
my
parents
to
look
into
buying
one
i
love
this
car
so
much
that
i
wrote
this
file
i
meant
to
write
a
couple
of
lines
and
ended
up
with
this
if
there
were
a
jd
powers
survey
for
used
car
owners
i
would
have
an
opportunity
to
express
my
incredible
satisfaction
of
owning
this
car
i
dont
like
thinking
about
getting
another
car
but
at
this
point
in
time
im
sure
id
buy
another
sho
for
under
you
cant
beat
it
next
time
with
an
airbag
and
abs
though
insurancewise
this
car
is
also
a
big
win
i
pay
the
same
premiums
as
on
my
toyota
celica
despite
that
it
has
nearly
twice
the
horsepower
other
odds
and
ends
much
to
my
amazement
there
is
no
sho
mailing
list
anywhere
maybe
because
the
sho
registry
publication
has
filled
this
void
i
havent
joined
yet
but
ive
noticed
that
queries
about
shos
still
appear
on
recautos
about
once
a
month
owners
of
shos
are
always
quick
to
respond
and
are
very
vocal
fans
of
the
cars
maybe
some
of
the
most
vocal
on
recautos
ive
put
together
the
responses
to
my
questions
about
the
cars
as
well
as
other
posts
with
useful
information
on
these
cars
ill
be
posting
this
in
the
form
of
a
faq
soon
if
anyone
is
interested
in
starting
a
mailing
list
please
speak
up
i
dont
know
if
i
have
the
resources
here
at
purdue
to
start
one
but
maybe
someone
out
there
does
