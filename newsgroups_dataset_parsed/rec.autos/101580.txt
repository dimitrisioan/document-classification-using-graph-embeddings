I
FOUND
THAT
I
NEEDED
SOME
SMALLER
SOCKETS
TO
UNDO
THE
SHOCKS
AND
A
CAN
OF
HELPED
THE
SOCKETS
NEEDED
WERE
METRIC
EXACT
FIT
BUT
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
USE
SOME
SAE
SOCKETS
AND
ARE
RATHER
CLOSE
TO
AND
IT
CAN
BE
FUN
HAVING
A
CANADIAN
FORD
IM
PICTUREING
THIS
UNDO
U
BOLTS
PUT
A
BOTTLE
JACK
ON
THE
AXLE
AND
RAISE
THE
BEDFRAME

TAKE
STRESS
OFF
OF
THE
LEAF

BOLTSBUSHINGS
JUST
THE
U
BOLTS
ON
EACH
SIDE
AND
THE
SHOCK
ABSORBER
JACKING
UP
THE
FRAME
SOME
MORE
HAD
TO
PUT
THE
SPARE
TIRE
ON
THE
GARAGE
FLOOR
AND
PUT
A
WOODEN
PLATFORM
ON
TOP
OF
THAT
TO
GET
THE
FLOOR
JACK
HIGH
ENOUGH
TO
RAISE
THE
FRAME
IT
ONE
TALLL
TRUCK
LIFTED
THE
SPRING
FREE
OF
THE
AXEL
TAKING
OUT
THE
BLOCK
GAVE
ME
ENOUGH
ROOM
TO
UNDO
THE
PIN
HOLDING
THE
SPRING
PACK
TOGETHER
THE
SPRING
PACK
WAS
HELD
TOGETHER
WITH
A
NUT
ON
TOP
AND
A
ROUND
HEAD
ON
THE
OTHER
END
NO
WRENCH
HEAD
VICE
GRIPS
WORKED
FINE
I
SOAKED
THE
NUT
WITH
AND
IT
CAME
RIGHT
OFF
FLIPPED
THE
BOTTOM
SPRING
AND
THEN
IS
THIS
A
NIGHTMARE
WAITING
TO
HAPPEN
OR
AN
EASY
THOUGH
PHYSICALLY
DEMANDING
THING
TO
DO
WELL
ITS
EASIER
THAN
DOING
A
DECENT
TRIGGER
JOB
ON
A
OK
WELL
MAYBE
ITS
NOT
THAT
EASY
BUT
ITS
NOT
TERRIBLY
DIFFICULT
I
DONNO
IM
A
LITTLE
MORE
SORE
TODAY
THAN
AFTER
WORKING
ON
A
A
FOOT
PIPE
CHEATER
WAS
A
REAL
HELP
TORQUE
SPEC
FOR
THE
U
BOLT
NUTS
IS
TO
FTLBS
A
DOESNT
HAVE
THAT
KIND
OF
TORQUE
SPEC
IT
WAS
A
CHALLENGE
TO
GET
THE
PACK
BOLT
BACK
IN
THE
SPRING
PACK
SQUEEZE
PACK
WITH
TWO
HANDS
HOLD
BOLT
WITH
THIRD
PUT
NUT
ON
WITH
FOURTH
WHILE
PICKING
UP
WRENCH
AND
VICE
GRIPS
WITH
FIFTH
AND
SIXTH
HANDS
I
USED
SOME
STRING
TO
TIE
THE
PACK
TOGETHER
WHILE
HOLDING
THE
PIN
IN
FOR
ALIGNMENT
THEN
I
COULD
LET
GO
TO
GET
THE
NUT
WRENCH
VICE
GRIPS
GETTING
THE
PIN
BACK
LINED
UP
WITH
THE
LIFT
BLOCK
WAS
A
CHALLENGE
TOO
UNTIL
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
THE
AXEL
HAD
TILTED
ANDOR
ROLLED
FORWARD
ONE
THE
DRIVERS
SIDE
A
BOTTLE
JACK
UNDER
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
TILTED
IT
BACK
IN
LINE
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
PIN
HEAD
TO
DROP
INTO
THE
RIGHT
HOLE
ON
THE
PASSENGER
SIDE
I
HAD
TO
WRESTLE
THE
WHEEL
INTO
ROLLING
FORWARD
ABOUT
INCH
TO
GET
THINGS
TO
LINE
UP
SPENT
MORE
THAN
AN
HOUR
WORKING
ON
GETTING
THE
PIN
HEAD
INTO
THE
HOLE
IN
THE
LIFT
BLOCK
WITH
LEVERS
AND
ROPES
AND
IMPLIMENTS
OF
DISTRUCTION
BEFORE
I
TOOK
A
BREAK
AND
THOUGHT
ABOUT
WHY
IT
WASNT
LINED
UP
ANYMORE
SINCE
IT
HAD
BEEN
LINED
UP
BEFORE
AND
I
DIDNT
MOVE
IT
SOMETHING
ELSE
MUST
HAVE
HMMM
AXLE
NO
LONGER
CONSTRAINED
NOT
TO
MOVE
HMMM
MOVE
IT
BACK
HMMM
AFTER
THAT
IT
WAS
ALL
MUCH
EASIER
TO
CLOSE
UP
BTW
THE
RIDE
IS
NOW
SOFTER
BUT
NOT
QUITE
AS
SOFT
AS
I
WAS
HOPING
FOR
AT
LEAST
IT
NOW
