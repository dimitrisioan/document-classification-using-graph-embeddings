MATTHEW
LIGGETT
WRITES
MUST
BE
ONE
SOMEWHERE
BELIEVE
BUGATTIS
COMINGHAS
OUT
ONE
SOMETHING
LIKE
TURBOS
AND
MUCHO
MACHO
HP
ONE
COOL
PRICE
TOO
AS
I
HEARD
AT
ANY
RATE
THE
POINT
IS
IM
PRETTY
SURE
THERE
IS
INDEED
ONE
IN
PRODUCTION
THO
RATHER
LIMITED
THIS
IS
NO
BUGATTI
ITS
LABELED
A
BUGATTI
BUT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
BUGATTIS
OF
YORE
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
JUST
SOME
PPL
WANTING
TO
BUILD
A
SILLY
SUPERCAR
AND
USE
THAT
NAME
TO
SELL
IT
DREW
MAY
BE
THINKING
OF
THE
CIZETA
MORODOR
BUT
THAT
HASNT
REACHED
PRODUCTION
AT
LEAST
NOT
YET
AS
FOR
THE
BUGATTI
WELL
I
HAVE
TO
AGREE
WITH
MATT
IT
AINT
THE
TOP
DOG
IT
AINT
SEXY
AND
SVELTLOOKING
AND
IT
AINT
A
REAL
BUGATTI
IN
FACT
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
ITS
IN
TIGHT
COMPETITION
WITH
THE
CONSULIER
FOR
THE
MOST
BUTTUGLY
CAR
OF
THE
DECADE
AWARD
IT
ISNT
THAT
BAD
AT
LEAST
THE
BUGATTI
HAS
COMPOUND
CURVES
COMPARED
TO
THE
SLAB
SIDES
ON
THE
CONSULIER
AND
THE
BUGATTI
HAS
A
QUAD
TURBO
THING
OF
IT
AS
THREE
CYLINDER
TURBO
ENGINES
TIED
TOGETHER
ALSO
ETTORE
BUGATTIS
NEPHEW
IS
ON
THE
BOARD
OF
DIRECTORS
AND
HAD
A
HAND
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
SO
THATS
ABOUT
AS
MUCH
BUGATTI
AS
YOU
ARE
LIKELY
TO
GET
IN
TODAYS
WORLD
MUCH
LIKE
ENZO
FERRARIS
ILLEGITAMATE
SON
BEING
ALLOWED
TO
TAKE
OVER
PART
OF
FERRARI
AS
WELL
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
ANY
CARS

BUT
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
MOTORCYCLES

THEM
BUT
I
COULDNT
TELL
YOU
WHICH
ONES
ALL
MOTORCYCLES

FUNNY
I

MOTORCYLCLIST

SAME
ABOUT

AND
THE
VF
LINE
OF
HONDAS
WERE
ALL
FROM

THROUGH
THE
INCLUDING
THE

AND
THE
PRESENT
IT
