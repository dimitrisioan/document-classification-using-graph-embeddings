WRITES
MY
WIFE
AND
I
LOOKED
AT
AND
DROVE
ONE
LAST
FALL
THIS
WAS
A
MODEL
IT
WAS
WAYYYYYYYYY
UNDERPOWERED
I
COULD
NOT
IMAGINE
DRIVING
IT
IN
THE
MOUNTAINS
HERE
IN
COLORADO
AT
ANYTHING
APPROACHING
HIGHWAY
SPEEDS
I
HAVE
READ
THAT
THE
NEW
MODELS
HAVE
A
NEWER
IMPROVED
HP
ENGINE
IM
QUITE
SERIOUS
THAT
I
LAUGHED
IN
THE
SALESMAN
FACE
WHEN
HE
SAID
ONCE
ITS
BROKEN
IN
IT
WILL
FEEL
MORE
POWERFUL
I
HAD
BEEN
USED
TO
DRIVING
A
JEEP
ENGINE
I
BELIEVE
THE
LAND
CRUISERS
LAND
YACHTS
WERE
THE
SAMES
AS
THE
WHICH
IS
ALSO
UNDERPOWERED
IN
MY
OWN
PERSONAL
OPINION
THEY
ARE
BIG
CARS
VERY
ROOMY
BUT
NOTHING
SPECTACULAR

I
LOVE
ANIMALS
THEY
TASTE
DELICIOUS
THE
LAND
CRUISER
HAS
A
ENGINE
WHICH
HAS
HP
AND
TORGUE
WHEN
I
DROVE
IT
HERE
IN
CALIFORNIA
POWER
IS
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
THE
HIGH
PRICE
IS
THE
ONLY
REASON
I
DID
NOT
BUY
IT
