RIPOFF

WENT
TO
A
PLACE

CHECK
MY
CAR
FOR
AC
LEAK
AFTER
CHECKING
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THERE
IS
A
LEAK
IN
THE
COMPRESSOR
SEAL
AT
THE
END
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
LABOR
FOR
THE
CHECK
I
WAS
CHARGED
DOLLARS
FOR
A
POUND
OF
FREON
ALTHOUGH
THEY
EVACUATED
MY
AC
AFTERWARDS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LEAK
FIRST
IS
IT
FAIR
FOR
HIM
TO
CHARGE
ME
FOR
A
POUND
OF
FREON
PLUS

SECOND
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
ABOUT
THIS
IF
THIS
