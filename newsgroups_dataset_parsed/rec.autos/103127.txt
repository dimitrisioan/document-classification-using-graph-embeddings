i
went
to
a
place
called
american
car
care
centers
to
check
my
car
for
ac
leak
after
checking
i
was
told
that
there
is
a
leak
in
the
compressor
seal
at
the
end
in
addition
to
the
labor
for
the
check
i
was
charged
dollars
for
a
pound
of
freon
although
they
evacuated
my
ac
afterwards
because
of
the
leak
first
is
it
fair
for
him
to
charge
me
for
a
pound
of
freon
plus
tax
second
what
can
i
do
about
