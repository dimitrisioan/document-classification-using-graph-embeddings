WRITES
I
JUST
BOUGHT
AN
ALTIMA
AND
LIKE
IT
VERY
MUCH
AND
YES
THERE
IS
A
LITTLE
STANZA
LOGO
EVER
SO
DISCRETELY
PLACED
ON
THE
TRUNK
THE
ALTIMA
IS
EMBLAZONED
IN
BIG
SILVER
LETTERS
BUT
THE
ITSYBITSY
STANZA
IS
SHUNTED
TO
THE
FAR
LEFT
OF
THE
TRUNK
LID
YOU
CAN
ONLY
SEE
IT
IF
YOU
GET
UP
CLOSE
TO
THE
CAR
AND
KNOW
WHERE
TO
LOOK
IT
IS
VERY
INCONSPICUOUS
IN
FACT
MY
FIRST
CLUE
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
STANZA
WAS
THAT
THE
OWNERS
MANUAL
CALLED
THE
CAR
A
NISSAN
STANZA
ALTIMA
ANYBODY
KNOW
WHY
NISSAN
DID
IT
THIS
WAY
TO
AVOID
PAPERWORK
ASSOCIATED
WITH
RECERTIFICATION
AS
A
BRAND
NEW
CAR
ETC
SO
FOR
AD
PURPOSES
ITS
A
BRAND
NEW
NAMEPLATE
FOR
PAPERWORK
ITS
STILL
A
STANZA
