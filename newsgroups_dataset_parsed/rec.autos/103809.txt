WRITES
IVE
OWNED
A
SATURN
FOR
AND
YEAR
AND
A
HALF
AND
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
EXTENDED
WARRANTY
BUT
JUST
TRADED
IT
IN
FOR
A
FOR
REASONS
THAT
I
WONT
MENTION
UNLESS
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
KNOW
I
OPTED
FOR
THE
MILE
EXTENDED
WITH
DEDUCTIBLE
ITS
SORTA
LIKE
BUYING
HEALTH
INSURANCE
YOU
COULD
SAY
THAT
YOURE
NOT
SICK
NOW
AND
HAVENT
BEEN
SICK
FOR
A
WHILE
BUT
YOU
CANT
GUARANTEE
THAT
YOU
WONT
BE
SICK
TOMORROW
A
LITTLE
MONEY
INVESTED
TODAY
IS
BETTER
THAN
BEING
SICK
TOMORROW
AND
NOW
BEING
ABLE
TO
PAY
FOR
IT
OR
HAVING
TO
PAY
A
LOT
MORE
TOMORROW
THAN
YOU
CAN
TODAY
JUSTIFY
ALL
YOU
WANT
EXTENDED
WARRANTIES
ARE
A
RIPOFF
HIGH
PROFIT
ITEM
FOR
THE
DEALER
AND
YOU
DIDNT
BUY
YOU
GET
FREE
SO
WHAT
YOU
BOUGHT
IS
AND
YOU
STILL
HAVE
TO
PAY
EVERY
TIME
YOU
USE
THIS
GREAT
WARRANTY
BETTER
TO
PUT
YOUR
MONEY
IN
THE
BANK
AND
USE
IT
FOR
REPAIRS
IFWHEN
YOU
NEED
IT
CONSIDERING
THAT
YOUR
LAST
CAR
WAS
ONLY
YEARS
OLD
ARE
YOU
SURE
YOU
WILL
EVEN
KEEP
THIS
NEW
ONE
PAST
ITS
FREE
WARRANTY
PERIOD
BTW
TYPICAL
PROFIT
ON
EXTENDED
WARRANTIES
IS
AROUND
THATS
RIGHT
ONLY
OF
THE
MONEY
NEEDS
TO
GO
INTO
THE
COLLECTIVE
POT
TO
PAY
FOR
ANY
FUTURE
REPAIRS
THAT
THE
GROUP
OF
EXTENDEDWARRANTYPEOPLE
COLLECT
