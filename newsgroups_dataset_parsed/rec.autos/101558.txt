infiniti
i
am
thinking
about
getting
an
infiniti
in
consumer
reports
it
is
ranked
high
in
many
catagories
including
highest
in
reliability
index
for
compact
cars
mitsubushi
galant
was
second
followed
by
honda
accord
a
couple
of
things
though
in
looking
around
i
have
yet
to
see
anyone
driving
this
car
i
see
lots
of
hondas
and
toyotas
there
is
a
special
deal
where
i
can
get
an
infinity
fully
loaded
at
dealer
cost
i
have
check
this
out
and
the
numbers
match
up
they
are
doing
this
because
they
are
releasing
and
update
version
includes
dual
airbags
and
want
to
get
rid
of
their
old
i
guess
my
question
is
is
this
a
good
deal
also
can
anyone
give
me
any
feedback
on
infiniti
thanks
carl
hoffman
ps
the
other
cars
that
i
have
test
driven
and
which
are
in
the
running
are
mitsubishi
galant
honda
accord
and
toyota
camary
