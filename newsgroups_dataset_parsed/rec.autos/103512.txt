PARTICULARLY
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
POWER
MANUAL
T
ONLY
ANY
COMPARISONS
BETWEEN
THE
SAAB
LINE
AND
THE
MERCEDES
WOULD
BE
HELPFUL
IF
A
MANUAL
TRANSMISSION
IS
A
MUST
HAVE
THEN
THE
MB
IS
NOT
IN
THE
RUNNING
YOU
CANNOT
GET
A
MANUAL
TRANSMISSION
IN
THAT
CAR
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
IT
SEEMS
THAT
BUYERS
HERE
OR
MAYBE
MORE
ACCURATELY
THE
DISTRIBUTORS
ARE
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
MANUAL
TRANNIES
THE
LINE
COMES
WITH
A
HP
ENGINE
ALL
EARLIER
YEARS
ARE
HP
I
HAVE
AN
WITH
A
MERE
HP
AND
AUTO
TRANNY
AND
I
FIND
THAT
IT
HAS
SUFFICIENT
POWER
FOR
ANY
NORMAL
DRIVING
SITUATION
MORE
IS
ALWAYS
NICE
BUT
I
CANT
COMPLAIN
I
TEST
DROVE
A
SAAB
CSE
LAST
FALL
HERE
ARE
MY
IMPRESSIONS
AWESOME
POWER
ESPECIALLY
OVER
WHEN
THE
TURBO
REALLY
COMES
ON
IF
YOU
GET
ON
THE
POWER
REALLY
HARD
IN
A
TIGHT
CORNER
THE
FRONTWHEEL
DRIVE
CAUSES
IT
TO
UNDERSTEER
HEAVILY
AND
THEN
VICIOUSLY
HOOK
INTO
THE
CORNER
NOT
A
DESIRABLE
HANDLING
TRAIT
BUT
COMMON
IN
POWERFUL
FRONT
DRIVE
CARS
THE
CSE
IS
MERCEDES
IS
REARDRIVE
SO
IT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THIS
PROBLEM
HUGE
INTERIOR
AND
CARGO
SPACE
THE
MOST
RUBBERY
SHIFTER
I
HAVE
EVER
ENCOUNTERED
I
DROVE
A
IT
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
NUMB
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
USED
TO
IT
I
DONT
KNOW
I
ALSO
DIDNT
LIKE
ITS
LOCATION
WHICH
WAS
TOO
FAR
DOWN
AND
TOO
FAR
RIGHT
FROM
THE
SHIFTERS
POSITION
I
GOT
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
SAAB
REALLY
DESIGNED
THE
CAR
FOR
AN
AUTOMATIC
IT
WAS
RATHER
NOISY
ENGINE
BUZZ
RATTLES
AND
CREAKS
MERCEDES
DOES
NOT
EXHIBIT
THESE
CHARACTERISTICS
YOU
SHOULD
ALSO
CHECK
OUT
THE
NEW
BMW
TOURING
THIS
IS
A
WAGON
VERSION
OF
THE
IT
FITS
INTO
THE
CLASS

THE

SAABS
