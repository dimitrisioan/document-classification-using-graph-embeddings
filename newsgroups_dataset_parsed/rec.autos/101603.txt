WENKING
SU
WRITES
THIS
HAS
ME
THINKING
IS
THERE
A
BIOLOGICAL
REASON
WHY
WOMEN
CANT
PUT
THEIR
KEYS
IN
THEIR
PANTS
POCKETS
LIKE
MEN
DO
I
HAVE
TWO
POCKETS
ON
THE
BACK
OF
EACH
OF
MY
PANTS
I
PUT
MY
KEYS
IN
ONE
AND
WALLENT
IN
ANOTHER
MANY
OF
THE
POCKETS
EVEN
HAVE
A
BOTTON
ON
THEM
SO
I
CAN
CLOSE
THEM
SECURELY
EVERYTHING
IS
THAT
MUCH
SIMPLER
FOR
ME
WHY
CANT
WOMEN
DO
THE
SAME
IS
IS
BIOLOGICAL
IE
NOT
ENOUGH
ROOM
FOR
A
BIGGER
BOTTOM
PLUS
KEYS
AND
A
WALLET
OR
IS
IT
THE
WAY
THEY
ARE
RAISED
BY
THE
PARENTS
OH
PULLEEZE
ITS
NOT
BIOLOGY
AT
ALL
ITS
CLOTHING
DESIGN
WOMENS
CLOTHING
IS
GENERALLY
DESIGNED
TO
BE
AS
NONFUNCTIONAL
AS
POSSIBLE
ITS
ONLY
BEEN
IN
THE
LAST
FIVE
YEARS
OR
SO
THAT
YOU
COULD
BUY
WOMENS
PANTS
WITH
POCKETS
DEEP
ENOUGH
TO
CARRY
ANYTHING
IN
PREVIOUSLY
DEEP
POCKETS
WERE
VIRTUALLY
UNKNOWN
IN
WOMENS
CLOTHING
SKIRTS
GENERALLY
HAVE
BETTER
POCKETS
NOW
TOO
DRESSES
ESPCIALLY
FANCY
DRESSES
ARE
STILL
PRETTY
HOPELESS
I
OFTEN
HAND
MY
DRIVERS
LICENSE
OVER
TO
MY
HUSBAND
IF
WERE
DRESSED
UP
TO
GO
OUT
SOMEWHERE
SO
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
BE
ENCUMBERED
BY
A
PURSE
IF
WOMEN
CONSISTENTLY
BOUGHT
FUNCTIONAL
CLOTHING
AND
BOYCOTTED
THE
MANUFACTURERS
WHO
REFUSE
TO
MAKE
FUNCTIONAL
WOMENS
CLOTHING
I
THINK
MANUFACTURERS
WOULD
TEND
TO
BOW
TO
MARKET
PRESSURES
THERES
AN
INTERESTING
CHAPTER
IN
SUSAN
FALUDIS
BACKLASH
THAT
DESCRIBED
WHAT
HAPPENED
THE
LAST
TIME
CLOTHING
MANUFACTURERS
IGNORED
THE
NEED
FOR
FUNCTIONAL
WOMENS
CLOTHING
THE
MANUFACTUING
INDUSTRY
LOST
MILLIONS
FROM
A
WOMAN
WHO
WOULD
RATHER
BUY
MENS
CLOTHING
WITH
DECENT
POCKETS
AND
LONG
LEGS
AND
HIGH
WAISTS
THAN
WOMENS
