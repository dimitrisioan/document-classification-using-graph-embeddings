what
is
ka
band
radar
where
is
it
used
should
a
radar
detector
be
able
to
handle
it
a
ka
band
has
recently
been
made
available
by
the
fcc
for
use
in
the
us
in
socalled
photoradar
installations
in
these
installations
a
lowpowered
beam
is
aimed
across
the
road
at
a
degree
angle
to
the
direction
of
traffic
and
a
picture
is
taken
of
vehicles
which
the
radar
unit
determines
to
have
been
in
violation
of
the
speed
limit
tickets
are
mailed
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
because
of
the
low
power
and
the
degree
angle
many
people
believe
that
a
radar
detector
cannot
give
reasonable
warning
of
a
ka
band
radar
unit
although
some
manufacturers
of
radar
detectors
have
added
such
capability
anyway
the
number
of
locales
where
photoradar
is
in
use
is
limited
and
some
question
the
legality
of
such
units
best
advice
learn
what
photo
radar
units
look
like
and
keep
track
of
where
they
are
used
or
else
dont
speed
photo
radar
and
mailed
tickets
make
no
sense
at
all
speeding
is
a
moving
violation
committed
by
the
operator
not
the
owner
the
owner
may
be
a
rental
agency
a
dealer
a
private
party
or
a
government
agency
as
long
as
the
owner
has
no
reason
to
expect
the
operator
will
be
driving
illegally
or
unsafely
the
owner
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
what
the
operator
does
the
car
may
even
have
been
driven
without
the
owners
knowledge
or
consent
i
cant
believe
a
mailed
ticket
where
the
driver
is
not
identified
would
stand
up
in
court
this
is
obviously
a
lazy
cynical
boneheaded
fascist
way
to
extort
revenue
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
public
safety
bk
we
had
those
fg
photoradar
things
here
in
sweden
a
while
ago
there
was
a
lot
of
fuzz
about
them
and
a
lot
of
sabotage
too
a
spraycan
with
touchup
paint
can
do
a
lot
of
good
eventually
they
had
to
drop
the
idea
as
there
were
a
lot
of
courtcases
where
the
owner
of
the
car
could
prove
he
didnt
drive
it
at
the
time
of
speeding
i
especially
recall
a
case
where
it
eventually
proved
to
be
a
carthief
that
had
stolen
a
car
and
made
false
plates
he
ofcourse
chose
a
license
number
of
a
identical
car
so
the
photo
seemed
correct
in
conclosion
photoradar
sucks
every
way
you
look
at
it
