based
on
my
experience
with
a
the
hardtop
jeepstyle
model
i
would
definitely
give
a
new
model
consideration
if
i
were
in
the
market
the
older
models
are
very
well
built
unless
toyota
lost
its
mind
i
would
assume
until
proven
otherwise
that
the
newer
models
have
inherited
some
if
not
all
of
the
qualities
of
their
ancestors
two
major
differences
in
the
running
gear
that
im
aware
of
need
study
my
has
a
solid
front
axle
housing
whereas
the
newer
models
have
independant
front
suspension
the
solid
axle
is
theoretically
stronger
and
the
new
cruisers
do
not
have
independent
suspension
in
the
front
they
still
run
a
straight
axle
but
with
coils
the
is
the
one
with
independent
front
the
cruisers
have
incredible
wheel
travel
with
this
system
more
reliable
than
the
newer
model
but
only
experience
will
tell
the
independant
front
suspension
is
no
doubt
a
compromise
made
to
satisfy
the
typical
user
who
will
never
need
a
real
utility
vehicle
the
second
difference
is
the
type
of
transfer
case
used
on
the
newer
models
im
not
sure
but
i
think
tioyota
went
to
a
fulltime
or
allwheel
drive
system
the
older
landcruisers
have
a
lockup
type
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
cruiser
does
have
full
time
but
the
center
diff
locks
in
low
range
my
brother
has
a
and
is
an
incredibly
sturdy
vehicle
which
has
done
all
the
trails
in
moab
without
a
tow
the
and
later
is
even
better
with
the
bigger
engine
and
locking
