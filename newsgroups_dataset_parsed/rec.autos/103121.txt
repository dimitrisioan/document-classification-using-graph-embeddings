im
considering
switching
to
geico
insurance
but
have
heard
that
they
do
not
assign
a
specific
agent
for
each
policy
or
claim
i
was
worried
that
this
might
be
a
real
pain
when
you
make
a
claim
i
have
also
heard
that
they
try
to
get
rid
of
you
if
you
have
an
accident
dont
worry
about
this
theyll
drop
you
like
a
hot
potato
after
you
do
make
a
claim
theyll
just
make
filing
the
claim
a
pain
but
it
will
end
when
they
leave
you
in
the
lurch
ive
read
in
this
group
that
geico
has
funded
the
purchasing
of
radar
guns
by
police
depts
im
not
sure
where
more
than
that
geico
funded
the
company
that
developed
lidar
when
locals
showed
a
reluctance
to
buy
the
units
geico
started
giving
them
away
i
know
theyve
given
units
to
the
florida
highway
patrol
county
sheriffs
a
and
some
local
governments
the
real
question
is
why
this
is
the
hook
geico
and
other
ins
cos
can
tell
which
drivers
represent
risk
this
is
a
determination
they
can
make
after
you
receive
a
speeding
ticket
from
one
of
geicos
lidar
units
most
drivers
do
not
represent
increased
risk
even
after
a
ticket
or
two
but
this
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
raise
rates
for
equal
risk
its
called
extra
profits
they
also
know
how
silly
the
nsl
is
and
how
it
is
almost
universally
ignored
driving
in
excess
of
the
nsl
gets
you
a
ticket
an
increase
in
your
rates
points
on
your
license
but
it
doesnt
make
you
a
riskier
driver
to
insure
like
the
sound
of
this
like
the
people
who
thought
up
the
scheme
go
geico
unless
you
have
some
driving
history
problems
youre
usually
better
to
go
with
one
of
the
major
companies
and
stay
there
youll
get
long
term
customer
discounts
on
your
premiums
now
about
the
of
your
premium
that
is
paid
as
commission
thats
another
story
for
another
day
