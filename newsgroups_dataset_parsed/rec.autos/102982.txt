ARBITRATION
MY
BBB
AUTOLINE
ARBITRATION
EXPERIENCE
IS
OVER
THE
OUTCOME
WAS
DECIDEDLY
MIXED
I
WON
THE
BATTLE
BUT
LOST
THE
WAR
THE
ARBITRATOR
FOUND
THAT
THE
CAR
WAS
DEFECTIVE
BUT
DECIDED
TO
OFFER
A
REPURCHASE
WELL
BELOW
MARKET
VALUE
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
HEARING
AVERAGE
RETAIL
ON
MY
TRUCK
IN
THE
NADA
BOOK
WAS
BUT
THE
DECISION
WAS
FOR
I
WROTE
A
LETTER
TO
THE
COUNCIL
OF
BETTER
BUSINESS
BUREAUS
POINTING
OUT
THE
FACT
THAT
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
AUTOMOBILE
THAT
DOES
NOT
DEPRECIATE
RAPIDLY
THE
MANUFACTURER
HAS
NO
INCENTIVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
YOU
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
THAT
THE
MANUFACTURER
CAN
LOOSE
BECAUSE
THEY
CAN
TURN
AROUND
AND
SELL
THE
VEHICLE
AT
A
PROFIT
IF
THE
CONSUMER
IS
AWARDED
A
REPURCHASE
THE
ATTITUDE
OF
CHEVROLETS
REPRESENTATIVE
AT
THE
HEARING
TENDS
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
HE
WAS
TOTALLY
UNPREPARED
AND
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
TAKE
THE
PROCEEDING
VERY
SERIOUSLY
I
DECIDED
TO
TAKE
THE
REPURCHASE
EVEN
THOUGH
I
AM
GETTING
TOTALLY
SCREWED
ON
THE
PRICE
I
WILL
NOT
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
CONTINUING
REPAIRS
OR
SELLING
A
LEMON
MYSELF
AND
I
HAVE
NO
CASE
FOR
A
CIVIL
SUIT
BASED
ON
THE
IDAHO
LEMON
LAW
I
AM
PLANNING
TO
SEND
A
LETTER
TO
MY
ELECTED
REPRESENTATIVES
TELLING
THEM
HOW
UTTERLY
RIDICULOUS
THE
IDAHO
LEMON
LAW
IS
THE
LAW
ALLOWS
FOR
A
USE
DEDUCTION
EQUAL
TO
THE
IRS
MILEAGE
ALLOWANCE
AS
IF
CHEVROLET
WERE
BUYING
MY
GAS
AND
PAYING
FOR
MY
INSURANCE
SUMMARY
OF
THE
CASE
IN
MAY
I
BOUGHT
A
NEW
TON
HD
CHEVROLET
PICKUP
BETWEEN
MAY
AND
DECEMBER
THIS
VEHICLE
REQUIRED
REPAIR
AFTER
REPAIR
SYSTEMS
THAT
REQUIRED
ATTENTION
INCLUDED
THE
TRANSMISSION
HEATER
FAN
PAINT
SUSPENSION
AND
MOTOR
THE
MAIN
PROBLEM
WAS
THE
FIVE
SPEED
MANUAL
TRANSMISSION
THEY
COULD
NOT
INSTALL
A
NONDEFECTIVE
TRANSMISSION
IN
AT
LEAST
FOUR
ATTEMPTS
SO
IN
SUMMARY
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
GET
A
REPURCHASE
BUT
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
GET
SCREWED
ON
THE
PRICE
UNLESS
YOU
PAID
TOO
MUCH
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
OR
IF
YOUR
CAR
HAPPENS
TO
BE
A
MODEL
THAT
DEPRECIATES
RAPIDLY
