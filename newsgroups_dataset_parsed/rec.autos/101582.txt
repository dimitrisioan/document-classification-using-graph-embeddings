STUFF
DELETED
THE
SILLY
THING
ABOUT
THIS
WHOLE
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
TRUNK
RELEASES
IM
TEMPTED
TO
SAY
ALL
BUT
THERES
BOUND
TO
BE
A
COUNTEREXAMPLE
ONLY
OPERATE
IF
THE
CAR
IS
ON
ACC
OR
RUNNING
THUS
YOU
CANT
EASILY
POP
THE
TRUNK
WITHOUT
STARTING
THE
CAR
MOST
CARS
THE
ONLY
CARS
IVE
EVER
SEEN
WITH
THIS
FEATURE
HAVE
BEEN
GM
CARS
MY
MAZDA
HONDA
AND
COMING
SOON
PROBE
ALL
HAVE
CABLEOPERATED
RELEASES
MY
CAMARO
HAD
AN
ELECTRIC
HATCH
RELEASE
THAT
WAS
THANKFULLY
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
KEY
IN
THE
IGNITION
THE
EXCEPTION
TO
THE
RULE
MENTIONED
IN
MY
FIRST
SENTENCE
I
SHOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
SAID
GLOVEBOX
TRUNK
RELEASES
I
HAVENT
ENCOUNTERED
ANY
GLOVEBOX
RELEASES
THAT
ARE
CABLE
OPERATED
NUMEROUS
GM
AND
SEVERAL
FORDMERCURY
CARS
THAT
IVE
ENCOUNTERED
HAVE
ELECTRICAL
RELEASES
IN
THE
GLOVEBOX
AND
ALL
OF
THE
ONES
IVE
SEEN
NEEDED
THE
IGNITION
ON
TO
SOME
DEGREE
TO
OPERATE
YOUR
CAMARO
EXAMPLE
IS
NOTED
BUT
SINCE
ITS
A
HARDTOP
ITS
NOT
A
BIG
DEAL
IVE
NEVER
RUN
INTO
A
CONVERTIBLE
WITH
A
CABLEOPERATED
TRUNK
RELEASE
ID
AGREE
THAT
IN
SUCH
AN
ENVIRONMENT
A
CABLE
OR
ALWAYSACTIVE
ELECTRICAL
RELEASE
WOULD
BE
RATHER
STUPID
JIM
FROST
JIMFCENTERLINECOM
MY
HONDA
HAS
A
CABLE
RELEASE
THAT
CAN
BE
LOCKED
OUT
WITH
THE
IGNITION
KEY
THE
VALET
KEY
CAN
BE
LEFT
WITH
SOMEONE
AND
WILL
NOT
UNLOCK
THE
TRUNK
OR
ENABLE
THE
CABLE
RELEASE
I
REMEMBER
MY
MOTHERS
CORVETTE
THAT
HAD
AN
ELECTRONIC
HATCH
RELEASE
LOCATED
ON
THE
DRIVERS
DOOR
WHICH
WAS
ALWAYS
ACTIVE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CAR
HAD
NO
REAL
TRUNK
MAKES
THE
SECURITY
MEASURE
OF
BEIGN
ABLE
TO
DISABLE
THE
HATCH
RELEASE
UNNECESSARY
