RE
RFI
ART
OF
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTING
IM
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
TRANNIES
USED
IN
WINSTON
CUP
BUT
IN
THE
TRANSAM
CARS
IVE
PLAYED
WITH
THE
TRANSMISSIONS
WERE
THE
RACING
VARIETY
WITH
DOG
CLUTCHES
INSTEAD
OF
SYCHROS
IN
A
TRANSMISSION
WITH
DOG
CLUTCHES
THE
GEARS
ARE
ALWAYS
ENGAGED
WITH
EACH
OTHER
AND
MOVING
THE
DOG
CLUTCHES
ENGAGES
THE
GEARS
TO
THE
SHAFTS
MOTORCYCLE
TRANSMISSIONS
ARE
THE
SAME
WAY
SHIFTING
WITHOUT
THE
CLUTCH
ON
A
TRANSMISSION
WITH
SYNCROS
CAN
AND
WILL
CAUSE
TRANSMISSION
DAMAGE
THE
ONLY
QUESTION
BEING
HOW
LONG
IT
TAKESTO
GRENADE
SOMETHING
FOR
THE
TRANS
IN
MY
PULSAR
SE
IT
WAS
ABOUT
MILES
BUT
IT
HAD
A
WEAK
TRANNY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
JUST
OUT
OF
CURIOSITY
HOW
IS
THIS
DOG
CLUTCH
ANY
DIFFERENT
FROM
A
SYNCHRO
TRANSMISSION
WHAT
YOU
DESCRIBED
SOUNDS
THE
SAME
TO
ME
IN
FACT
WHAT
LITTLE
IVE
STUDIED
ON
TRANNIES
THE
INSTRUCTOR
REFERRED
TO
THE
SYNCHROS
AS
DOGS
AND
SAID
THEY
WERE
SYNONYMOUS
THE
GEARS
ARE
ALWAYS
MESHED
IN
A
SYNCHRONIZED
GEARBOX
AND
YOU
SLIP
THE
SYNCHRO
GEARS
BACK
AND
FORTH
BY
SHIFTING
OR
AT
LEAST
THAT
IS
WHAT
I
WAS
TAUGHT
EXPLAIN
POR
FAVOUR
MOTORCYCLE
TRANSMISSIONS
DONT
HAVE
SYNCHROS
THE
ENGAGMENT
DOGS
ARE
VERY
CORSE
AND
SLOPPY
THERE
ARE
MAYBE
TEETH
DOGS
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
GEARS
THAT
ENGAGE
THE
NEXT
GEAR
OVER
AS
THE
FORKS
SLIDE
THE
GEARS
BACK
AND
FORTH
TO
SHIFT
START
TO
APPLY
PRESSURE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
CLUTCH
IS
PULLED
THE
CLUTCH
IS
A
HAND
LEVER
AND
SHIFT
QUICKLY
IF
YOU
TRY
A
SLOW
LAZY
SHIFT
IT
WILL
GRIND
YOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
POP
IT
INTO
THE
NEXT
GEAR
BEFORE
IT
HAS
A
CHANCE
TO
GRIND
THERE
ISNT
A
NEUTRAL
BETWEEN
GEARS
OBVIOUSLY
THERE
IS
BUT
YOU
CANT
SELECT
IT
WITH
THE
SHIFTER
SO
DOUBLE
CLUTCHING
IS
NOT
A
POSSIBILITY
SPEED
SHIFTING
WHICH
IS
WHAT
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
HEARD
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTING
CALLED
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
FOR
UPSHIFTS
WITH
SOME
PRACTICE
BUT
I
USUALLY
USE
THE
CLUTCHESPECIALLY
FOR
THE
LOWER
GEARS
I
THINK
AUTO
AS
IN
AUTOMOBILE
TRANNYS
ARE
SIMILAR
EXCEPT
THAT
THE
ENGAGMENT
DOGS
ARE
VERY
FINE
WITH
NO
SLOP
AND
THE
ADDITION
OF
SYNCHO
RINGS
THE
GEAR
TEETH
ARE
ALWAYS
ENGAGED
IN
AUTO
TRANSMISSIONS
THAT
ARE
SYNCHRONIZED
BUT
MAY
NOT
BE
IN
NONSYNCHRO
GEARS
REVERSE
