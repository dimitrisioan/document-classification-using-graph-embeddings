my
top
list
of
dumbest
automotive
concepts
ever
backup
lights
on
corvette
theyre
on
the
sides
of
the
car
sure
would
be
interested
to
know
what
years
this
was
i
dont
seem
to
recall
any
car
with
backup
lights
on
the
sides
much
less
any
corvette
i
suppose
i
could
be
misinterpreting
what
you
are
trying
to
say
here
just
a
quick
comment
backup
lights
mounted
on
the
side
would
actually
be
extremely
useful
for
people
backing
out
of
parking
stalls
while
i
cant
think
of
any
corvettes
with
side
mounted
backup
lights
i
know
that
saab
started
using
them
about
years
ago
my
saab
didnt
have
them
but
a
friends
saab
certainly
did
in
addition
to
the
confentional
taillight
mounted
backup
lights
they
had
another
set
integrated
into
the
front
turn
signal
assembly
for
those
of
you
who
dont
remember
saabs
of
that
vintage
had
an
enormous
multicoloured
plastic
growth
about
the
size
of
a
national
geographic
magazine
sticking
out
of
the
front
fender
which
incorporated
amber
parking
lights
amber

marker
lightsreflectors
white
cornering
lamps
like
american
luxury
cars
aimed
towards
the
side
of
the
road
when
you
have
your
turn
indicators
on
and
white
backup
lights
aimed
towards
the
back
of
the
car
when
you
have
selected
reverse
gear
the
glossy
brochure
showed
how
these
front
mounted
backup
lights
were
useful
for
illuminating
hazards
pot
holes
kids
toys
etc
that
would
be
run
over
by
the
front
of
the
car
if
you
had
the
wheels
turned
while
backing
