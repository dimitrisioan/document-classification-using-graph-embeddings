RE
FAST
IDLE
ON
FORD
RANGER
LES
BARTEL
WRITES
IT
DID
IT
AGAIN
THIS
MORNING
MY
FORD
RANGER
WAS
IDLING
AT
RPM
OK
SO
I
EXAGGERATED
A
LITTLE
BUT
IT
WAS
IDLING
VERY
FAST
IT
HAS
A
LITER
CARBURATED
ENGINE
IN
IT
AND
NO
BLIPPING
OF
THE
THROTTLE
WOULD
CAUSE
THE
IDLE
TO
DROP
BACK
TO
NORMAL
I
DONT
THINK
THE
LINKAGE
IS
STUCK
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
TO
FIX
THIS
PROBLEM
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
PROBLEM
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
BUT
HAS
STRAIGHTENED
ITSELF
OUT
UNTIL
NOW
I
DONT
HAVE
A
TACH
BUT
BY
GAUGING
BY
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
ENGINE
IT
IS
IDLING
ABOUT
TWICE
AS
FAST
AS
IT
SHOULD
BE
THIS
IS
DOWN
FROM
WHAT
IT
WAS
IDLING
AT
WHEN
I
PULLED
UP
AT
A
STOP
LIGHT
SOMETIMES
A
BAD
CHOKE
PULLOFF
DIAPHRAM
WILL
CAUSE
A
CAR
TO
FAST
IDLE
THE
PULLOFF
WHICH
IS
VACUUM
ACTUATED
PROVIDES
A
NECESSARY
PULL
IN
NONCOLD
WEATHER
CONDITIONS
TO
GET
THE
IDLE
OFF
THE
THE
FAST
IDLE
CAM
LOCATE
THE
FAST
IDLE
CAM
ON
YOUR
VEHICLE
AND
SEE
IF
YOU
CAN
ROTATE
IT
TO
PRODUCE
A
NORMAL
IDLE
IF
SO
LOCATE
THE
DIAPHRAM
AND
TEST
IT
IF
YOU
CANT
APPLY
SUCTION
VIA
A
GOOD
PIECE
OF
RUBBER
VACUUM
HOSE
WITH
YOUR
MOUTH
THAT
WILL
CAUSE
THE
DIAPHRAM
TO
RETRACT
THEN
ITS
BAD
AND
SHOULD
BE
REPLACED
