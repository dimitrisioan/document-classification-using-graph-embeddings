ID
LIKE
TO
ADD
THE
BERETTA
GTZ
AS
A
CAR
WHICH
WILL
KICK
GSR
BUTT
ANYDAY
AND
ITS
A
LOT
CHEAPER
TO
BOOT
COMPARING
THE
GTZ
AND
GSR
IS
APPLES
TO
ORANGES
SOMEWHAT
LIKE
A
MUSTANG
AND
A
CRX
BOTH
HAVE
VERY
DIFFERENT
WAYS
OF
DOING
THINGS
AND
OUGHT
TO
APPEAL
TO
DIFFERENT
BUYERS
IE
I
DONT
THINK
AN
ACURA
OWNER
WOULD
BE
SEEN
DEAD
IN
A
CHEVY
DEALERSHIP
OR
VICE
VERSA
STUFF
DELETED
ARE
ALL
WEATHER
NOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
THE
INTEGRA
RIDES
ALOT
BETTER
THAN
NO
INTEGRA
I
HAVE
SEEN
COMES
WITH
ALLSEASON
TIRES
THE
GTZ
DOES
COME
WITH
MUCH
BIGGER
WHEELS
ALONG
WITH
THE
INTEGRA
AND
THE
CAR
DOES
THAT
WITH
SMALL
INCH
TIRES
THAT
YOUR
ACCELEARTION
TIMES
ALSO
VARY
MAGAZINE
TO
MAGAZINE
ROAD
TRACK
AND
CAR
DRIVER
HAVE
THE
GSR
AT
TO
FOR
ROAD
AND
TRACK
THE
CD
FIGURES
ARE
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
BOGUS
AND
BASED
ON
A
HOT
PROTOTYPE
SUPPLIED
BY
ACURA
THE
MT
FIGURES
ARE
MORE
PLAUSIBLE
ALSO
QUARTER
MILE
TIMES
VARY
FROM
TO
SOUNDS
REASONABLE
PROBABLY
FASTER
THAN
REGULAR
INTEGRAS
SO
THE
BERETTA
CAN
OUT
HANDLE
THE
INTEGRA
AND
IT
CAN
CERTAINLY
KEEP
UP
WITH
IT
IN
ACCELERATION
AND
THE
BERETTA
PROBABLY
HAS
A
HIGHER
TOP
SPEED
DUE
TO
THE
HORSEPOWER
ADVANTAGE
HPTORQUE
FOR
THE
INTEGRA
VS
FOR
THE
BERETTA
YOU
ALWAYS
BELIEVE
THOSE
EXACT
NUMBERS
WHY
DONT
YOU
DRIVE
A
GSR
AND
SEE
FOR
YOUR
SELF
WHILE
THE
GSR
HAS
A
LOW
TORQYE
ITS
HIGH
GEARING
OVER
A
THE
GSR
GEARING
IS
HORRIBLE
FOR
DAY
TO
DAY
DRIVING
IT
NEEDS
A
SPEED
BOX
MORE
THAN
ANY
OTHER
MODERN
CAR
ESSENTIALLY
IN
A
REGUALR
INTEGRA
EQUALS
IN
THE
GSR
AND
THE
REGULAR
INTEGRAS
ARE
VERY
BUZZY
AT
SPEED
RPM
MAKE
UP
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
STILL
WOULDNT
CALL
IT
A
TORQUE
MOSTER
THOUGH
CONSIDERING
YOU
SAVE
ALMOST
DOLLARS
FOR
THE
BERETTA
AND
THE
IS
A
RELIABLE
ENGINE
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
GET
THE
INTEGRA
AS
A
THE
ONLY
PERSON
I
KNEW
WITH
A
GTZ
HAD
IT
BOUGHT
BACK
BY
GM
AS
A
LEMON
IT
WAS
A
PIECVE
OF
JUNK
BUT
VERY
QUICK
FOR
FWD
QUAD
RELIABLE
YEAH
WHATS
YOUR
DEFINITION
OF
RELIABLE
IF
THATS
RELIABLE
THEN
ITS
SAFE
TO
SAY
THAT
INTEGRA
ENGINES
IN
GENERAL
ARE
NEAR
PERFECT
THE
ONLY
GSR
OWNER
I
KNOW
HAD
THE
ENGINE
THROW
A
ROD
WITH
LESS
THAN
MILES
A
RARE
SCREW
UP
BY
HONDA
BOTH
THE
GTZ
AND
GSR
ARE
FLAWED
CARS
THE
PERFORMANCE
ENTHUSIASTS
WOULD
TAKE
THE
GTZ
AND
THE
CR
PURCHASE
WOULD
BE
THE
GSR
CRAIG
