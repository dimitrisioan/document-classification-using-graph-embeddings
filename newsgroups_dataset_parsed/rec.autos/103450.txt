REVIEW
AUDI
QUATTRO
ITS
BEEN
A
WHILE
SINCE
IVE
REVIEWED
A
CAR
BUT
TODAY
I
PAID
A
VISIT
TO
AN
OLD
FRIEND
WHOSE
LOVE
FOR
AUDIS
HAS
BEEN
SO
OVERWHELMING
THAT
HE
MAKES
A
NOT
TOO
SUCESSFUL
LIVING
SELLING
THEM
WITHOUT
FURTHER
DELAY
I
WILL
GET
TO
THE
AUDI
SERVOTRONIC
STEERING
FOR
THOSE
WHO
ARE
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
WHAT
SERVOTRONIC
IS
IT
IS
THE
NAME
FOR
THE
SPEED
VARIABLE
POWER
STEERING
MANUFACTURED
BY
ZF
AND
USED
IN
AUDIS
AND
BMWS
I
HAVE
BEEN
OUTSPOKEN
IN
MY
DAMMING
OF
SERVOTRONIC
OVER
THE
PAST
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
AND
THIS
WAS
BASED
ON
MAGAZINE
REVIEWS
AND
DRIVES
OF
THE
AUDI
CS
QUATTRO
AND
THE
AUDI
FWD
I
AM
QUITE
HAPPY
TO
REPORT
NOW
THAT
ON
THE
THE
SERVOTRONIC
IS
INOFFENSIVE
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
DUE
TO
THE
FAT
GUMBALL
TIRES
THE
SERVOTRONIC
HAS
BEEN
LOADED
UP
MORE
AND
THIS
SO
FAR
HAS
BEEN
THE
BEST
IMPLEMENTATION
THAT
I
HAVE
TRIED
IT
IS
FAR
FROM
PERFECT
MIND
YOU
AND
ID
BE
MUCH
HAPPIER
IF
IT
WAS
AN
OPTION
THAT
I
COULD
REFUSE
BUT
ON
THE
I
NO
LONGER
CONSIDER
THIS
TO
BE
BAD
ENOUGH
WHERE
I
FEEL
THE
ENTIRE
CAR
IS
RUINED
THE
STEERING
IS
STILL
A
TAD
TOO
LIGHT
BUT
IT
IS
ACCURATE
AND
I
SUPPOSE
THE
STIFFLY
SPRUNG
CHASSIS
SENDS
BACK
SO
MUCH
INFORMATION
THAT
SOME
MAKES
IT
THROUGH
TO
THE
DRIVERS
HANDS
SO
THERE
IS
FEEL
AND
THERE
IS
ACCURACY
IN
THE
STEERING
BUT
THERE
IS
ALSO
ROOM
FOR
IMPROVEMENT
I
CONSIDER
THE
STEERING
TO
BE
BETTER
THAN
THE
JAPANESE
COMPETITION
PRIMARILY
BECAUSE
THE
JAPANESE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
FEEL
AND
ENGINEER
IT
OUT
COMPLETELY
ENGINE
WHEEE
WHAT
A
PRESSURE
COOKER
WITH
JUST
MILES
ON
THE
CLOCK
I
DID
NOT
EXPECT
THE
TO
BE
PRODUCING
ANYWHERE
CLOSE
TO
WHAT
IT
WILL
BE
PUTTING
OUT
MILES
LATER
BUT
STILL
THE
CAR
PACKS
A
TERRIFIC
PUNCH
FOR
A
TURBOCHARGED
MACHINE
IT
IS
VERY
UNUSUAL
IN
THAT
IT
ENCOURAGES
LAZY
DRIVING
IE
LOW
REVS
HIGH
GEAR
IT
IS
SO
SUPREMELY
FLEXIBLE
THAT
ONE
COULD
HARDLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THERES
ONLY
LITERS
OF
DISPLACEMENT
TO
MOVE
THIS
POUND
CAR
AROUND
IN
SUCH
A
FASHION
WITH
MAXIMUM
TORQUE
AVAILABLE
AT
RPM
AND
A
RPM
REDLINE
THE
CAR
CAN
PRETTY
MUCH
BE
LEFT
IN
THIRD
ALL
DAY
WHICH
TRANSLATES
TO
A
SPEED
RANGE
OF
SOMETHING
LIKE
MPH
A
CHRACTERISTIC
THAT
ONE
NORMALLY
ASSOCIATES
WITH
LARGE
CAPACITY
THE
TECHNICAL
ACHIEVEMENT
IS
BREADTHTAKING
THROTTLE
RESPONSE
IS
RIGHT
UP
THERE
WITH
A
GOOD
ATMOSPHERIC
ENGINE
IN
FACT
IT
WOULD
EVEN
PUT
PEAKY
MULTIVALVE
ENGINES
TO
SHAME
DOWNSHIFTS
ARE
ALMOST
UNNECESSARY
IT
IS
MORE
FUN
TO
USE
THE
OVERBOOST
FEATURE
THAN
TO
REV
THE
ENGINE
FOR
THOSE
NOT
FAMILIAR
THE
ENGINE
FEATURES
UP
TO
SECONDS
OF
ADDITIONAL
TURBO
BOOST
FOR
PASSING
SORT
OF
LIKE
LIGHTING
UP
THE
AFTER
BURNERS
IN
A
JET
FIGHTER
ONE
COULD
WITH
THE
RIGHT
FOOT
ONLY
IN
THIRD
GEAR
BLAST
THE
CAR
FROM
TO
IN
JUST
A
FEW
MOMENTS
SIMPLY
BY
FLOORING
THE
GAS
AS
FAR
AS
THE
NUMBERS
GO
MAXIMUM
TORQUE
AVAILABLE
IN
OVERBOOST
MODE
SHOOTS
UP
TO
ABOUT
LB
FT
INCREDIBLE
FOR
A
LITER
IT
TAKES
A
FEW
MOMENTS
FOR
IT
TO
DEVELOP
OVERBOOST
BUT
IT
IS
WELL
WORTH
WAITING
FOR
SINCE
THIS
IS
QUITE
A
HEAVY
CAR
ONES
BODY
PARTS
ARE
NOT
FLUNG
AROUND
LIKE
SAY
THE
CORRADO
THE
ACCELERATION
IS
SMOOTH
AND
STRONG
SOMEWHAT
SIMILAR
TO
RIDING
IN
A
JETLINER
AS
IT
ACCELERATES
DOWN
THE
RUNWAY
ON
TAKEOFF
ALSO
ONE
IS
TREATED
TO
A
VERY
DISTINCTIVE
AND
ENTERTAINING
WHISTLE
FROM
THE
TURBO
THE
ONLY
ENTERTAINING
SOUND
TO
COME
OUT
OF
A
VERY
REFINED
BUT
BLAND
SOUNDING
BANGER
YES
AUDI
HAS
REFINED
THE
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
AT
RPM
IT
SOUNDS
AS
SERENE
AS
IT
DOES
AT
THE
SMOOTHNESS
IS
OUTSTANDING
BUT
NOT
QUITE
UP
TO
THE
STANDARDS
OF
A
VERY
GOOD
EG
A
VALVE
BMW
ID
SAY
THAT
IN
TERMS
OF
REFINEMENT
IE
WILLINGNESS
TO
REV
SMOOTHNESS
LACK
OF
HARSHNESS
UNDER
FULL
ACCELERATION
IT
IS
BETTER
THAN
MANY
HOWEVER
LOST
IN
THE
REFINEMENT
PROCESS
IS
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
CYLINDER
BARK
THAT
MADE
THE
OLDER
ENGINES
SO
CHARACTERFUL
IF
NOT
TERRIBLY
REFINED
THE
VALVE
TURBO
SOUNDS
PRETTY
BLAND
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
WHISTLE
UNDER
FULL
BOOST
SUBJECTIVELY
ID
RATE
THE
VW
ENGINE
AS
BEING
FAR
MORE
MUSICAL
THAN
THE
TURBO
ALSO
AUDIS
OWN
IS
ALSO
FAR
MORE
MUSICAL
WITH
A
RORTY
RACE
CAR
GROWL
WHEN
PRESSED
THOUGH
NONE
OF
THESE
CAN
MATCH
ITS
GRUNT
THE
ONLY
HINT
OF
THE
ENGINES
TRUE
CAPACITY
OCCURS
WHEN
ONE
IS
TAKING
OFF
FROM
REST
AFTER
THE
TURBO
HAS
COME
TO
A
NEAR
STOP
WITH
THE
EXTRA
INERTIA
FROM
THE
PERMANENTLY
ENGAGED
SYSTEM
ONE
HAS
TO
BE
SOMEWHAT
DELICATE
IN
FEEDING
IN
THE
CLUTCH
TO
PREVENT
AN
EMBARASSING
STALL
ALTERNATELY
ONE
COULD
USE
MORE
REVS
IN
BOTH
CASES
A
VERY
SMALL
PRICE
TO
PAY
FOR
SUCH
A
FANTASTIC
ENGINE
I
THINK
THAT
AUDI
OF
AMERICA
SHOULD
OFFER
AN
AUTOMATIC
OPTION
FOR
THIS
CAR
JUST
AS
THEY
OFFER
THOUGH
IN
EXTREMELY
SMALL
NUMBERS
A
SPEED
FOR
THE
MUCH
PEAKIER
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
ENGINE
ARE
PERFECT
FOR
AN
AUTOMATIC
IRONICALLY
IN
EUROPE
A
SLUSH
IS
AVAILABLE
BUT
NONE
IS
OFFERED
FOR
THE
LAND
OF
THE
SLUSH
MARKETING
TWITS
REARING
THEIR
UGLY
HEADS
AGAIN
CHASSIS
IVE
NOTICED
THAT
AUDIS
TEND
TO
HAVE
VERY
WIDE
WHEELS
AND
RELATIVELY
MODEST
TIRE
WIDTHS
THE
CAR
COMES
WITH
FIRESTONES
OF
SIZE
WHICH
IS
NOT
UNCOMMON
AT
ALL
HOWEVER
THE
VERY
ATTRACTIVE
SPOKE
WHEELS
ARE
NO
LESS
THAN
INCHES
WIDE
SO
THERE
IS
NO
SIDEWALL
BULGE
WHATSOEVER
COMBINED
WITH
THE
FLARED
WHEEL
ARCHES
THE
HAS
A
MOUTH
WATERING
MACHO
YET
SUBDUED
LOOK
ON
ROUGH
CONCRETE
IT
BECOMES
IMMEDIATELY
CLEAR
THAT
THE
NEW
BODY
STYLE
HAS
MADE
SIGNIFICANT
ADVANCES
IN
STRUCTURAL
RIGIDITY
AS
WELL
AS
ROAD
NOISE
SUPPRESSION
I
SUPPOSE
THE
TWO
ARE
INTERRELATED
BUT
I
DIGRESS
TO
USE
A
CLICHE
THE
BODY
FEELS
LIKE
IT
HAS
BEEN
CARVED
OUT
OF
STONE
FLEX
IS
TOTALLY
UNDETECTABLE
EVEN
WHEN
GOING
OVER
ROUGH
ROADS
WITH
A
SUPER
RIGID
BODY
LIKE
THIS
STIFF
SPRINGS
AND
STIFF
DAMPERS
DO
NOT
CAUSE
EXCESSIVE
HARSHNESS
AND
WHILE
THE
RIDE
QUALITY
WILL
NEVER
WORRY
A
LEXUS
IT
WILL
ALSO
NOT
DRAW
COMPARISONS
TO
TRUCKS
OR
PONY
CARS
THE
SERVOTRONIC
STEERING
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
MENTIONED
I
CONSIDER
IT
TO
BE
INOFFENSIVE
BECAUSE
IT
DID
NOT
INHIBIT
SPIRITED
CORNERING
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
TEST
THE
CARS
CORNERING
POWERS
WITHOUT
TOO
MUCH
TREPIDATION
I
THINK
A
NEW
CONCEPT
IS
AT
WORK
IN
THIS
CAR
WITH
ITS
FAT
GUMBALL
TIRES
TALKING
ABOUT
UNDERSTEER
OR
OVERSTEER
IS
PRACTICALLY
MEANINGLESS
ON
A
BANKED
HIGHWAY
ON
RAMP
I
WENT
IN
SLOW
AND
STARTED
APPLYING
POWER
AS
I
WENT
AROUND
I
COULD
FEEL
THE
G
FORCES
BUILD
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
THE
SKIN
ON
MY
FACE
WAS
BEING
TUGGED
SIDEWAYS
YET
THE
CAR
WAS
TOTALLY
AND
COMPLETELY
OBEDIENT
TO
THROTTLE
AND
STEERING
INPUTS
IT
FELT
THAT
THE
LIMITS
WERE
NOT
EVEN
CLOSE
TO
BEING
APPROACHED
THE
G
FORCES
WERE
THRILLING
BUT
THE
ENTIRE
AFFAIR
OF
GOING
AROUND
A
CURVE
IS
STRANGELY
UNINVOLVING
YOU
TELL
THE
CAR
WHAT
YOU
WANT
AND
IT
DOES
IT
END
OF
STORY
I
THINK
THAT
I
AM
STARTING
TO
RELATE
MORE
AND
MORE
TO
THOSE
REVIEWERS
WHO
WERE
HIGHLY
IMPRESSED
BY
THE
HONDA
NSXS
CLINICAL
EFFICIENCY
BUT
WERE
UNABLE
TO
FALL
IN
LOVE
WITH
THE
CAR
THE
BRAKES
HAVE
A
VERY
GOOD
FIRMNESS
TO
THEM
AND
STOP
THE
CAR
PRETTY
WELL
TOO
THOUGH
IVE
READ
THAT
THEY
ARE
PRONE
TO
FADE
I
AM
NOT
TOO
SURPRISED
SINCE
THE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
UPRATED
BRAKES
OVER
THE
BASE
AUDI
FWD
HARDER
PADS
WOULD
HELP
BUT
THAT
IN
TURN
WOULD
LEAD
TO
A
MORE
WOODEN
RESPONSE
WHEN
COLD
I
AM
STARTING
TO
SEE
A
TREND
AMONG
THE
LUXURYSPORTS
SEDAN
MAKERS
WHERE
EXTRA
WEIGHT
IS
NOT
BEING
OFFSET
BY
ADDITIONAL
BRAKING
CAPACITY
THE
FADE
PERFORMANCE
IS
NOTHING
TO
BRAG
ABOUT
NEITHER
IS
THE
OR
THE
LEGENDS
BRAKE
FADE
THESE
DAYS
SEEM
TO
BE
A
FORGOTTEN
VIRTUE
WHEN
EVERYBODYS
ATTENTION
IS
FOCUSED
ON
ANTILOCK
CAPABILITY
COMFORT
FOR
A
CAR
WITH
SUCH
SPORTY
ABILITIES
ITS
COMFORT
LEVELS
ARE
ALSO
EXCELLENT
THE
CABIN
IS
BEAUTIFULLY
APPOINTED
WITH
CARBONFIBER
PANEL
INSERTS
IN
PLACE
OF
THE
WOOD
TRIM
OF
THE
ALL
THE
EXPECTED
GIZMOS
ARE
THERE
HEATED
SEATS
POWER
SEATS
SEAT
MEMORY
POWER
THIS
AND
THAT
THE
GLARING
OMMISION
WAS
THE
TRIP
COMPUTER
WHICH
WAS
REMOVED
BECAUSE
AUDI
HASNT
GOTTEN
IT
TO
WORK
RELIABLY
YET
THAT
MEANS
THAT
THE
CAR
HAS
NO
BOOST
GAUGE
A
REAL
DISAPPOINTMENT
TAKING
INTO
ACCOUNT
HOW
MUCH
THE
TURBO
DOMINATES
ITS
PERFORMANCE
UNUSUAL
FOR
THE
GERMANS
THE
COMES
WITH
A
HONDA
STYLE
MOONROOF
AS
WELL
AS
THE
VERY
INTELLIGENT
DIALASUNROOFPOSITION
ROTARY
SWITCH
NOISE
LEVELS
INCLUDING

AND
TIRE
NOISE
IS
SO
LOW
THAT
I
WOULDNT
CONSIDER
THE
LEXUS
ADVANTAGE
IN
THIS
AREA
TO
BE
SIGNIFICANT
ENOUGH
TO
SWAY
A
POTENTIAL
BUYER
CONCLUSION
EVEN
THOUGH
FEW
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
AFFORD
AN
AUDI
AT
ITS
STICKER
PRICE
OF
THE
CAR
IS
A
BARGAIN
IF
ONE
TAKES
INTO
ACCOUNT
WHAT
IT
HAS
TO
OFFER
OVER
THE
COMPETITION
THE
VALVE
TURBO
IS
A
REAL
GEM
EVEN
IF
IT
DOESNT
PRODUCE
FERRARI
SOUNDS
NO
OTHER
LUXURYSPORTS
SEDAN
MAKER
OFFERS
THE
UTTER
SECURITY
OF
QUATTRO
ALL

WHICH
TO
SOME
IS
WORTH
THE
EXTRA
MONEY
ALL
BY
ITSELF
THE

ARE
ALSO
TOP
NOTCH

IMPACT
STANDARD
COMPLIANT
THE
VERY
ELEGANT
AUTOMATIC

BELT
TENSIONERS
AND
THE

THE

AUDIS
HAVE
BEEN
OUTSTANDING
IN
GOVERNMENT
CRASH
TESTS
IT
GETS
MY
THUMBS
UP
FOR
BEING
SO
OVERWHELMINGLY
CAPABLE
RATHER
THAN
BEING
ALL

EXCITING
AND
INTOXICATING
ELIOT
