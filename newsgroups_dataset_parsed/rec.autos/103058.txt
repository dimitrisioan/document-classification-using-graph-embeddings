A
CAR
ABOUT
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
FINALLY
CAN
GET
HOLD
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
OF
THE
CAR
AND
GOT
ALL
MAINTANENCE
HISTORY
OF
THE
CAR
IN
BETWEEN
AND
THE
INSTRUMENT
PANNEL
OF
THE
CAR
HAS
BEEN
REPLACED
AND
THE
ODOMETER
ALSO
HAS
BEEN
RESET
TO
ZERO
THEREFORE
THE
TRUE
METER
READING
IS
THE
READING
BEFORE
REPLACEMENT
PLUS
CURRENT
MILEAGE
THAT
SHOWS
MILE
DIFFERENCE
COMPARING
TO
THE
MILEAGE
ON
THE
ODOMETER
DISCLOSURE

ABOUT
THAT
IMPORTANT
STORY
I
HOPE

THINK
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE

ANYONE
HAVE
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCES
