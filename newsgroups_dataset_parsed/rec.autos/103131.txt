since
the
wheeltire
is
balanced
off
the
car
ie
the
lugnuts
are
not
normally
involved
how
would
they
do
that
i
would
think
that
since
the
lugs
are
so
close
to
the
center
of
rotation
any
slight
difference
in
weight
between
a
normal
lugnut
and
a
locking
one
would
not
have
any
noticable
effect
on
the
balance
i
could
be
wrong
it
is
friday
afternoon
