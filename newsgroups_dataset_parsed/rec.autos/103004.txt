im
looking
for
information
on
opel
cars
now
you
ask
which
model
well
the
sad
truth
is
im
not
entirely
sure
but
its
a
twoseater
with
rollover
headlights
hard
top
and
really
sporty
looking
gibbonsasfuca
this
would
be
the
manta
would
it
not
sold
through
buick
dealers
in
the
mid
as
the
price
leader
chintan
amin
sounds
more
like
an
opel
gt
neat
cars
fun
to
drive
sold
through
buick
from
through
if
i
remember
correctly
i
believe
it
was
in
that
there
were
some
engine
mods
made
such
that
parts
were
not
interchangeable
with
the
older
models
parts
are
thus
much
harder
to
come
by
for
the
later
models
parts
in
general
are
not
too
difficult
to
find
at
one
time
jc
whitney
carried
some
stuff
including
a
brand
new
not
remfg
long
block
either
a
gt
or
a
kharman
ghia
hmm
that
spelling
looks
hosed
will
be
my
next
project
mark
