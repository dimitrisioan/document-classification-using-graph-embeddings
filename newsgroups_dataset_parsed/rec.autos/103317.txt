WRITES
THERE
ARE
TWO
CRANK
CONFIGURATIONS
FOR
THE
FLAT
THE
MOST
COMMON
ONE
IS
PROBABLY
THE
CRANK
THAT
IS
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
THE
CRANK
WHICH
FLAT
ENGINES
HAVE
STYLE
CRANKS
COMPARING
THOSE
TWO
ENGINES
THE
AND
THE
FLAT
HAVE
NO
FIRST
ORDER
SHAKING
FORCES
OR
ROCKING
MOMENTS
THE
HAS
A
SECOND
ORDER
SHAKING
FORCE
WHILE
THE
FLAT
HAS
A
SECOND
ORDER
ROCKING
MOMENT
THE
SIGNIFICANT
THING
ABOUT
THE
FLAT
SECOND
ORDER
MOMENT
IS
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
EASILY
BALANCED
OUT
BY
ADDING
MASS
AT
THE
ENDS
OF
THE
CRANK
THE
HOWEVER
REQUIRES
A
COUNTER
ROTATING
SHAFT
WITH
MASS
TO
BALANCE
OUT
THE
SECOND
ORDER
FORCES
I
AM
SURE
THAT
SUBARU
AND
PORSCHE
USE
THE
BOXER
CONFIGURATION
AND
NOT
THE
INLINE
CRANK
THAT
YOU
ANALYZED
AND
COMPARED
WOULD
YOU
CARE
TO
REEVALUATE
THE
OTHER
CASE
OF
A
FLAT
FOUR
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
CONFIGURATION
IS
PERFECTLY
BALANCED
AS
FAR
AS
PRIMARY
SECONDARY
FORCES
AND
COUPLES
ARE
CONCERNED
I
HAVE
AN
ARTICLE
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
THAT
SAYS
SO
BOTTOM
LINE
THE
BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
ENGINES
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
THEIR
INTENDED
USE
THE
FLAT
IS
EASIER
TO
FIT
UNDER
LOW
HOODS
AND
IN
REAR
COMPARTMENTS
FOR
MID
OR
REAR
MOUNTING
THE
CAN
BE
MOUNTED
TRANSVERSELY
TO
REDUCE
HOOD
LENGTH
READ
CAB
FORWARD
OTHER
THAN
THAT
THERE
ISNT
MUCH
FANFARE
TO
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THEM
NO
MATTER
WHAT
SUBARU
ADS
SAY
TECHNOLOGY
SHARED
WITH
PORSCHE
INDEED
THE
FLAT
FOUR
IS
ALSO
SHORTER
THAN
AN
INLINE
SO
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
MOUNTED
LONGITUDINALLY
IT
WILL
NOT
TAKE
UP
LOTS
OF
LENGTH
AND
A
LONGITUDINAL
PLACEMENT
IS
EASIER
FOR
A
WHEEL
DRIVE
DRIVETRAIN
I
THINK
THAT
SUBARUS
ADS
HOLD
WATER
IN
PRACTICE
THEIR
FLAT
FOURS
ARE
NOTICEABLY
SMOOTHER
THAN
INLINE
AND
COMPLETELY
BUZZ
FREE
THOUGH
SOME
MAY
NOT
LIKE
ITS
PECULIAR
NOTE
BUT
AS
ALFA
HAS
SHOWN
A
BOXER
FOUR
CAN
PRODUCE
A
SPINE
TINGLING
SCREAM
THAT
ONLY
THE
LIKES
OF
RECENT
HONDAS
CAN
APPROACH
