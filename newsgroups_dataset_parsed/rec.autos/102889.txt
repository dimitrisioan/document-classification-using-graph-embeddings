RE
INSTEAD
OF
A
SATURN
WHAT
IN
JASON
M
ROTH
WRITES
RT
HAD
AN
ARTICLE
ON
CARS
OF
THE
ILK
AND
THEY
LIKED
THE
CIVIC
EX
THE
ESCORT
GT
AND
THE
BEST
OF
ALL
AND
THE
WAS
WAY
DOWN
THE
LIST
EXCEPT
FOR
BRAKING
I
JUST
LOOKED
AT
THAT
ARTICLE
FIRST
OF
ALL
THIS
SUMMARY
IS
INACCURATE
OF
CARS
THE
WAS
RIGHT
BEHIND
THESE
MENTIONED
AND
THE
SUZUKI
SWIFT
AS
HAS
BEEN
POINTED
OUT
IT
WAS
A
SEMISILLY
COMPARISON
THE
SATURN
WAS
AT
LEAST
CHEAPER
THAN
THE
AND
ESCORT
ADMITTEDLY
NEGLIGIBLE
BUT
AN
ISSUE
AND
LESS
THAN
THE
HONDA
THE
STATED
GOAL
WAS
A
BASE
UNDER
THE
HONDA
WAS
OVER
WHILE
THE
AT
THE
SAME
PRICE
WAS
EXCLUDED
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THEY
LET
THE
BEST
HONDA
PLAY
BUT
NOT
THE
BEST
SATURN
NOTE
THAT
THE
SATURN
DID
BEAT
THE
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
CAR
COMPARISON
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
THE
PRICE
GOES
REST
ASSURED
THAT
THE
STREET
PRICES
FOR
THE
AND
ESCORT
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
THE
HONDA
WILL
BE
LESSER
THAN
THAT
OF
THE
SATURN
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
ALL
PRICE
COMPARISONS
IVE
SEEN
ARE
BASED
ON
MSRP
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
SATURN
DEALER
WILL
SELL
THE
CAR
FOR
STICKER
PRICE
WHEREAS
THE
OTHERS
WILL
DO
IT
WAY
BELOW
STICKER
