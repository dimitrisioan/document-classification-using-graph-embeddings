hey
you
programmers
out
there
danny
phornprapha
please
consider
this
bugs
are
another
endangered
earth
lucc
student
konsultant
species
needing
your
protection
work
for
an
all
out
sports
car
id
go
for
the
without
the
sports
suspension
which
is
too
stiff
for
a
little
more
practicality
and
more
comfort
the
nissan
turbo
is
a
good
buy
and
for
a
good
dose
of
luxury
the
lexus
is
perfect
with
a
manual
transmission
of
course
however
the
toyota
supra
is
coming
out
soon
and
if
you
like
its
looks
the
performance
is
supposed
to
be
great
almost
race
car
like
i
dont
particulary
like
the
mitsubishi
or
the
dodge
stealths
as
they
are
too
heavy
and
arent
very
nimble
handlers
for
a
sports
car
a
