ONE
OF
THE
LOCAL
DEALERS
HAS
A
USED
MILES
PROBE
GT
ON
THE
LOT
WITH
A
PHOTOCOPY
OF
A
DOCUMENT
TAPED
TO
THE
WINDOW
SAYING
THE
DEALERSHIP
BOUGHT
THE
CAR
BACK
FROM
THE
PREVIOUS
OWNER
BECAUSE
OF
ENGINE
NOISES
BUT
THAT
THE
FORD
DISTRICT
REP
HAD
OKED
THE
CAR
SAYING
THOSE
NOISES
WERE
NORMAL
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
WORTH
LOOKING
INTO
THE
CAR
SEEMS
OTHERWISE
CLEAN
AND
MENTIONED
THIS
TO
A
COWORKER
WHO
PROCEEDED
TO
TELL
ME
A
HORROR
STORY
ABOUT
HER
SONS
PROBE
GT
WHICH
HAD
SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
ENDING
WITH
ENGINE
NOISES
WHICH
SHE
SAID
WAS
SOMETHING
WITH
THE
HEADS
THAT
FORD
ACKNOWLEDGED
THE
NOISE
SAID
THEY
WERE
WORKING
ON
IT
BUT
DIDNT
HAVE
A
CURE
AS
OF
YET
HER
SON
TRADED
THE
CAR
IN
AND
I
CHECKED
NOT
THE
SAME
CAR
SO
I
HAVE
SOME
EVIDENCE
OF
A
REOCCURING
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
IN
THE
PROBE
GTS
AND
BY
EXTENSION
WITH
THE
MADZA
AND
ANYTHING
TO
THIS
ID
LOVE
TO
CONSIDER
BUYING
THE
GT
IM
TURNING
TIME
FOR
MY
SCHEDULED
MID
LIFE
CRISIS
BUT
ID
HATE
TO
FIND
OUT
I
JUST
BECAME
THE
PROUD
