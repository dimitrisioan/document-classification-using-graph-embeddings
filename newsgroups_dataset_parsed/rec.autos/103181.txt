RE
CHANGING
OIL
BY
SELF
IN
ARTICLE
JOHN
FOSTER
WRITES
I
FIND
THIS
METHOD
MUCH
BETTER
MYSELF
TOO
ALTHOUGH
I
DO
REALLY
HATE
IT
WHEN
THE
BOLT
FINALLY
COMES
LOOSE
AND
THE
WRENCH
AND
MY
HAND
BOTH
COME
CRASHING
INTO
MY
FACE
AFTER
COMING
TO
WHICH
IS
ABOUT
MINUTES
LATER
I
CHANGE
MY
CLOTHES
BECAUSE
BY
THIS
TIME
ALL
THE
OIL
HAS
DRAINED
ON
ME
AND
ICE
MY
ENTIRE
FACE
AND
SUCK
DOWN
ABOUT
TYLENOL
TO
EASE
THE
PAIN
LATER
IN
THE
DAY
I
THEN
PROCEED
WITH
REFILLING
THE
ENGINE
OIL
ITS
JUST
CRAZY
HOW
I
TRY
AND
CHANGE
THE
OIL
ON
MY
CARS
IN
ONE
WEEKENDI
GO
THROUGH
ABOUT
BOTTLES
OF
TYLENOL
AND
BAGS
OF
ICE
OH
THATS
NOT
SO
BAD
EVERY
TIME
I
TRY
TO
CHANGE
THE
OIL
I
FORGET
TO
SHUT
OFF
THE
ENGINE
FIRST
THE
HOT
OIL
COMES
OUT
AND
SCALDS
ME
BLINDS
ME
THEN
THE
ENGINE
STARTS
TO
OVERHEAT
AND
WHILE
IM
SCREAMING
IN
AGONY
AND
TRYING
TO
CRAWL
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THE
CAR
I
GRAB
THE
RED
HOT
EXHAUST
PIPE
AND
GET
THIRD
DEGREE
BURNS
ON
MY
HANDS
MY
SCREAMS
INTENSIFY
AS
I
FINALLY
EMERGE
FROM
UNDER
THE
CAR
AND
I
STRUGGLE
TO
MY
FEET
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
CAR
WHEREUPON
THE
RADIATOR
HOSE
RUPTURES
AND
SPRAYS
ME
WITH
SUPER
HEATED
COOLANT
THEN
THE
ENGINE
SEIZES
BUT
NOT
BEFORE
THE
CYLINDER
HEAD
EXPLODES
PIERCING
MY
FLESH
WITH
FRAGMENTS
OF
RED
HOT
IRON
THIS
HAPPENS
EVERY
TIME
IM
STARTING
TO
THINK
I
SHOULD
PAY
THE
MECHANIC
INSTEAD
PAYING
THE
HOSPITAL
AND
THE
DEALER
FOR
A
NEW
CAR
THIS
GETS
COSTLY
WHEN
YOU
CHANGE
THE
OIL
EVERY
MILES
