I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
WAS
ORIGINALLY
DESIGNED
FOR
A
TRUCK
NOT
NECESSARILY
A
PICKUP
AND
THEN
JUST
SORT
OF
DROPPED
INTO
THE
VIPERS
FRAME
BECAUSE
IT
FIT
AND
WAS
AVAILABLE
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
AND
I
SAW
AND
HEARD
A
VIPER
AND
MY
FRIENDS
FIRST
RESPONSE
WAS
THAT
IT
SOUNDED
LIKE
A
TRUCK
IT
SOUNDED
FINE
TO
ME
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
I
DONT
LIKE
THE
WHINY
NOISE
THAT
MOST
MODERN
SPORTS
CAR
ENGINES
MAKE
BTW
THE
VIPER
WE
SAW
WAS
MOVING
AT
ABOUT
JUST
LIKE
ALL
OF
THE
OTHER
CARS
ON
THE
FREEWAY
HEADING
EAST
OUT
OF
LA
ON
A
FRIDAY
AFTERNOON
LOOKED
REALLY
NICE
THOUGH
ACTUALLY
I
WAS
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
IN
THE
VIPER
WAS
NOT
THE
THAT
DODGE
WAS
DEVELOPING
FOR
ITS
NEW
KENWORTHS
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
THE
EXHAUST
SYSTEM
AND
NOT
THE
ENGINE
THAT
PRODUCED
THE
NOISE
OF
A
CAR
WELL
YES
THE
EXHAUST
IS
WHERE
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
NOISE
COMES
OUT
BUT
THE
BASICS
TONE
FIRING
CADENCE
ETC
ARE
DETERMINED
BY
THE
ENGINE
CONFIGURATION
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
VIPER
YES
WE
ARE
DISCUSSING
A
HUGE
MULTICYLINDER
ENGINE
WHICH
WILL
SOUND
SOMEWHAT
LIKE
A
TRUCK
AND
MY
UNDERSTANDING
BTW
IS
THAT
THAT
ENGINE
WAS
DESIGNED
ORIGINALLY
WITH
THE
INTENTION
OF
BEING
AD
APTIBLE
FOR
EITHER
THE
TRUCKS
OR
THE
VIPER
AND
FROM
WHAT
IVE
HEARD
NO
FIRST
HAND
KNOWLEDGE
ITS
DOING
A
PRETTY
GOOD
JOB
AT
BOTH
AND
THE
BEST
EXHAUST
SOUND
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
NOW
AND
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
A
DOHC
