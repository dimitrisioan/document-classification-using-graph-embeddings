ON
COCHRAN
WRITES
ID
LIKE
TO
ADD
THE
BERETTA
GTZ
AS
A
CAR
WHICH
WILL
KICK
GSR
BUTT
ANYDAY
AND
ITS
A
LOT
CHEAPER
TO
BOOT
I
WILL
TAKE
THIS
ONE
WITH
A
DEFINATE
GRAIN
OF
SALT
PERFORMANCE
DATA
SHOWS
A
IF
THIS
POSTER
HAS
SOME
PROOFOTHER
THAN
MY
FRIEND
BLEW
ONE
AWAY
LAST
WEEK
WANT
PROOF
HERE
IS
SOME
DATA
ON
ACCELERATION
AND
HANDLING
FROM

TREND
APR
INTEGRA
GSR
BERETTA
GTZ
MILE
L
ACC
GS
SLALOM
WRONG
WHY
DONT
YOU
LOOK
AGAIN
AT
MOTOR
TRENDS
SLALOM
TIMES
THEY
ARE
RIGHT
ALONG
WITH
THE
INTEGRA
AND
THE
CAR
DOES
THAT
WITH
SMALL
INCH
TIRES
THAT
ARE
ALL
WEATHER
NOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
THE
INTEGRA
RIDES
ALOT
BETTER
THAN
A
BERETTA
YOUR
ACCELEARTION
TIMES
ALSO
VARY
MAGAZINE
TO
MAGAZINE
ROAD
TRACK
AND
CAR
DRIVER
HAVE
THE
GSR
AT
TO
FOR
ROAD
AND
TRACK
ALSO
QUARTER
MILE
TIMES
VARY
FROM
TO
YOU
CANT
TELL
EXACTLY
BY
THE
NUMBERS
FURTHERMORE
THE
INTEGRA
WILL
DEFINATELY
OUTRUN
THE
BERETTA
ON
THE
HIGH
END
CAR
DRIVER
AND
ROAD
TRACK
HAVE
THE
GSR
DOING
TO
MPH
AND
IT
GETS
THERE
FAST
SO
THE
BERETTA
CAN
OUT
HANDLE
THE
INTEGRA
AND
IT
CAN
CERTAINLY
KEEP
UP
WITH
IT
IN
ACCELERATION
AND
THE
BERETTA
PROBABLY
HAS
A
HIGHER
TOP
SPEED
DUE
TO
THE
HORSEPOWER
ADVANTAGE
HPTORQUE
FOR
THE
INTEGRA
VS
FOR
THE
BERETTA
YOU
ALWAYS
BELIEVE
THOSE
EXACT
NUMBERS
WHY
DONT
YOU
DRIVE
A
GSR
AND
SEE
FOR
YOUR
SELF
WHILE
THE
GSR
HAS
A
LOW
TORQYE
ITS
HIGH
GEARING
OVER
A
RPM
MAKE
UP
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
STILL
WOULDNT
CALL
IT
A
TORQUE
MOSTER
THOUGH
THE
BIGGEST
ADVANTAGE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
THE
PRICE
THE
INTEGRA
COSTS
AS
TESTED
MOTOR
TREND
THE
GTZ
COSTS
AS
TESTED
THE
GTZ
ALSO
HAS
STANDARD
NICITIES
AND
AIRBAG
AND
ANTILOCK
BRAKES
AN
AIRBAG
IS
NOT
AVAILABLE
ON
THE
INTEGRA
AND
LOWER
MODELS
DO
NOT
HAVE
ABS
CONSIDERING
YOU
SAVE
ALMOST
DOLLARS
FOR
THE
BERETTA
AND
THE
IS
A
RELIABLE
ENGINE
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
GET
THE
INTEGRA
AS
A
PERFORMANCE
COUPE
WHICH
IS
WHAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
TRYING
TO
MAKE
IT
OUT
TO
BE
QUAD
RELIABLE
YEAH
WHATS
YOUR
DEFINITION
OF
RELIABLE
IF
THATS
RELIABLE
THEN
ITS
SAFE
TO
SAY
THAT
INTEGRA
ENGINES
IN
GENERAL
ARE
NEAR
PERFECT
NOT
TO
MENTION
A
HELL
OF
ALOT
SMOOTHER
AND
QUIETER
BALANCE
SHAFTSTHE
ACURA
HAS
THE
ENGINE
WINS
THE
RELIABLITY
CONTEST
HANDS
DOWN
YOU
CAN
REV
THAT
CAR
ALL
DAY
EVERYDAY
AND
YOULL
NEVER
BLOW
A
HOSE
OR
CRACK
THE
BLOCK
OR
ANYTHING
ELSE
I
SPEAK
FROM
EXPIERENCE
IM
NOT
SAYING
THE
QUAD
IS
A
BAD
ENGINE
BUT
DONT
HIGHLIGHT
RELIABILITY
WHEN
YOU
COMPARING
IT
TO
A
ACURA
ENGINE
AND
WHILE
THE
INTEGRA
COSTS
ALOT
MORE
IT
IS
A
BETTER
INVESTMENT
SINCE
IT
WILL
HOLD
ITS
VALUE
CONSIDERABLY
MUCH
BETTER
AND
DOES
A
NICE
JOB
AT
BEING
A
SPORTY
CAR
AND
PRACTICAL
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
NOTE
THIS
ISNT
A
FLAME
ON
THE
GTZ
OR
OTHER
GM
QUAD
PRODUCTS
THE
BERRETA
IS
A
NICE
CAR
AND
PUTS
OUT
RESPECTABLE
PERFORMANCE
AND
A
VERY
REASONABLE
PRICE
NOT
TO
MENTION
IT
HAS
AN
AIRBAG
BUT
TO
START
QUOTING
FIGURES
FROM
ONE
SOURCE
ISNT
TOO
RELIABLE
READ
OTHER
SOURCES
AND
DRIVE
BOTH
CARS
WHILE
I
HAVENT
DRIVEN
A
GTZ
I
HAVE
DRIVEN
GTS
AND
GRAND
AMS
WITH
QUAD
ENGINES
SO
THEY
ARE
SIMILAIR
