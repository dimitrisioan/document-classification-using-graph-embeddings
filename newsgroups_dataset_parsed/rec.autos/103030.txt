i
just
started
reading
this
thread
today
so
forgive
me
if
it
has
already
been
mentioned
butwhat
was
the
deal
with
renaults
putting
the
horn
on
the
lefthand
turnsignal
stalk
it
was
a
button
on
the
end
where
the
washer
button
would
be
on
the
wiperwasher
stalk
could
the
frenchies
not
figure
out
the
wiring
through
the
steering
wheel
or
what
had
an
alliance
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
comfortable
but
sluggish
car
i
got
very
used
to
the
horn
on
the
stalk
after
a
couple
months
worth
of
getting
used
to
it
after
i
bought
my
next
car
a
chevy

took
me
forever
to
get
used
to
the
horn
on
the
steering
wheel
