HOW
ABOUT
THE
THOUSANDS
OF
KIND
TEENAGERS
WHO
VOLUNTEER
AT
LOCAL
AGENCIES
TO
HELP
CHILDREN
SENIORS
THE
HOMELESS
HEAR
HEAR
THANKS
ROBBIE
YOU
ALSO
DONT
READ
THAT
MUCH
ABOUT
VIOLENCE
AGAINST
TEENAGERS
SUCH
AS
GEORGE
BUSH
BURYING
ALIVE
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
UNARMED
IRAQI
WHO
WERE
TRYING
TO
SURRENDER
WITH
BULLDOZERS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
THINK
IT
IS
TRUE
WITHOUT
SINGLING
OUT
TEENAGERS
FOR
BLAME
THAT
VIOLENCE
IS
MORE
SOCIALLY
ACCEPTABLE
THAN
IT
USED
TO
BE
THOSE
OF
US
WHOD
LIKE
TO
DISCOURAGE
VIOLENCE
HAVE
PLENTY
OF
WORK
TO
DO
WITH
PEOPLE
OF
ALL
AGES
WELL
THIS
ISNT
THE
RIGHT
GROUP
FOR
THIS
BUT
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
VIOLENCE
IS
ANY
MORE
SOCIALLY
ACCEPTABLE
NOW
BY
ANY
MEANS
HOW
CAN
YOU
SAY
THAT
WHEN
WE
USED
TO
HAVE
OF
PISTOLTOTING
GUNSLINGERS
AS
HEROS
OR
EVEN
GANGLAND
THUGS
BEING
CONSIDERED
ROMANTIC
DO
YOU
THINK
OUR
GREAT
GRANDPARENT
GOT
YELLED
AT
BY
THEIR
PARENTS
FOR
PLAYING
COWBOYS
AND
INDIANS
I
DONT
THINK
SO
THAT
BEHAVIOR
WAS
SOMEWHAT
ENCOURAGED
BACK
THEN
IN
FACT
I
THINK
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
NOW
AND
THEN
IS
THAT
NOWADAYS
WHEN
SOME
TEENAGER
KILLS
ANOTHER
ONE
IN
A
CLASSROOM
IN
CALIFORNIA
WE
HERE
ABOUT
IT
IN
MA
THE
SAME
DAY
BACK
IN
THE
OLD
DAYS
THEYD
NEVER
HEAR
ABOUT
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
PERIOD
YEAH
PEOPLE
ACT
REALLY
SHOCKED
ABOUT
VIOLENCE
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
NEW
TO
OUR
SPECIES
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
HOLOCAUST
THE
CRUSADES
THE
SALEM
WITCH
TRIALS
THE
RELIGIOUS
PERSECUTIONS
OF
THE
MIDDLEAGES
WHAT
ABOUT
VIOLENT
ACTS
CARRIED
OUT
IN
THE
NAME
OF
RELIGION
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
PUT
TO
DEATH
BY
THE
ROMANS
THE
JEWS
PERSECUTED
BY
CHRISTIANS
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
MORE
HUMANS
TODAY
THAN
THERE
HAVE
EVER
BEEN
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
THE
STATS
BUT
THERE
ARE
FAR
MORE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
PLANET
THAN
THERE
WERE
OR
HUNDRED
YEARS
AGO
THE
PER
CAPITA
ACTS
OF
VIOLENCE
ARE
PROBABLY
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
THAN
THEY
WERE
A
HUNDRED
OR
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
AGO
THERE
IS
NOTHING
NEW
ABOUT
VIOLENCE
