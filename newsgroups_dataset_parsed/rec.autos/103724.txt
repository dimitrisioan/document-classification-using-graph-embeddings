GTS
HEADLIGHT
COVERS
I
HAVE
A
EAGLE
TALON
AND
I
WANTED
A
PAIR
OF
GTS
HEADLIGHT
COVERS
ACTUALLY
THEY
ARE
TURNING
SIGNAL
COVERS
SINCE
THE
TALONS
THAT
YEAR
HAD
POPUP
LIGHTS
I
WENT
TO
A
AUTO
SHOP
AND
BOUGHT
THE
TAILLIGHT
BLACKOUTS
FOR
BUT
THEY
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
TURNING
SIGNAL
COVERS
IN
STOCK
I
ASKED
HOW
MUCH
IT
WOULD
BE
AND
HE
TOLD
ME
IT
WOULD
COST
ME
ANOTHER
I
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
A
BIT
HIGH
FOR
TWO
SMALL
PIECES
OF
PLASTIC
CAN
ANYONE
FIND
ME
A
CHEAPER
PAIR
OR
EVEN
A
USED
ONE
