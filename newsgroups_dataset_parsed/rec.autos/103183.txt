saturn
extended
warranty

i
agree
with
gaia
even
though
the
saturn
has
proved
to
be
a
very
reliable
car
so
far
a
little
money
spent
now
is
worth
the
peace
of
mind
this
is
an
interesting
point
some
people
are
not
really
buying
the
coverage
they
are
buying
peace
of
mind
marketing
folks
love
selling
that
i
suggest
that
people
choose
to
not
engage
their
minds
in
peaceless
worry
rather
than
buying
that
peace
of
mind
in
my
opinion
getting
the
powertrain
warranty
is
enough
in
my
case
thats
be
cause
anything
that
needed
repairing
in
the
interior
sunroof
windows
doors
etc
i
could
do
myself
i
just
didnt
want
to
mess
with
the
engine
and
such
youd
be
surprised
how
much
the
little
knickknack
stuff
can
cost
what
if
your
ac
goes
out
steering
rack
dont
get
me
wrongim
against
all
extended
warrantiesthey
are
a
ripoff
plus
i
think
the
extra
years
of
roadside
assistance
must
be
worthe
so
meting
i
opted
for
the
year
plan
for
extra
yrs
you
realize
the
first
is
free
warranty
that
comes
with
the
car
