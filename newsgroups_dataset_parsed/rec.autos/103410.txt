I
BOUGHT

MY
WIFE
NNNNNNNNG
THANK
YOU
FOR
PLAYING
I
CANNOT
AGREE
WITH
THIS
I
BELIEVED
THIS
AND
TO
PUT
IT
NICELY
IT
WAS
A
PIECE
OF
JUNK
I
LOVED
THIS
CAR
I
BABIED
IT
I
PAMPERED
IT
AND
AFTER
YEARS
IT
JUST
COULDNT
STAY
TOGETHER
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
NOT
EVERYONE
WILL
HAVE
THE
PROBLEMS
THAT
I
HAD
BUT
KNOW
THIS
ITS
NOT
JUST
THE
CAR
IT
IS
THE
ABILITY
TO
GET
THE
CAR
FIXED
WHICH
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
AT
ANY
CHRYSLERDODGETAKE
YOUR
PICK
DEALER
I
DONT
CARE
IF
THERE
ARE
GOING
TO
REFORM
THEIR
DEALERSSERVICE
WITH
THE
INTRO
OF
THE
LH
CARS
I
WILL
BELIEVE
IT
WHEN
I
SEE
IT
CASE
AND
POINT
THE
LOCAL
DODGE
DEALER
YOU
DRIVE
UP
JUST
LOOKING
YOU
DONT
EVEN
GET
OUT
OF
YOUR
DOOR
WHEN
ABOUT
YES
SALESMAN
ALL
EYE
YOU
LIKE
THEIR
NEXT
MEAL
AND
LITERALLY
POUNCE
ON
YOU
AND
TRY
TO
GET
YOU
TO
MAKE
A
DEAL
ON
EVERYTHING
YOUR
EYE
WANDERS
TOWARDS
SERVICE
IS
ABOUT
TIMES
WORSE
THAN
THAT
I
HAD
AN
ALIGNMENT
PROBLEM
BUT
THEY
TRIED
TO
TELL
ME
THAT
THE
K
FRAME
WAS
BENT
AND
ABOUT
DOLLARS
OF
WORKPARTS
TO
FIX
IT
LET
ME
TELL
YOU
THE
PROBLEMS
I
HAD
AND
I
TOOK
CARE
OF
THIS
CAR
I
PUT
ALOT
OF
MILES
ON
IT
IN
THE
FIRST
COUPLE
YEARS
BUT
TOOK
IT
TO
EVERY
CHECKUP
IT
NEEDED
AND
MANY
THAT
SHOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
DODGE

ES
THESE
WERE
REPLACED

THOSE
ARE
JUST
THE
THINGS
I
CAN
REMEMBER
OFF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
FOR
ABOUT
A
YEAR
BEFORE
I
SOLD
THE
CAR
I
SAID
TO
MYSELF
ITS
A
GOOD
CAR
I
JUST
CANT
FIND
ANYBODY
COMPETENT
ENOUGH
THE
FIX
IT
IN
THE
END
BEFORE
I
TRADED
IT
IN
FOR
A
SATURN
THE
POWER
STEERING
STARTED
ACTING
UP
AGAIN
I
JUST
STOPPED
PUTTING
MONEY
INTO
IT
I
MUST
HAVE
PUT
AT
LEAST
WORTH
OF
REPAIRS
OVER
ITS
LIFETIME
I
AM
SORRY
BUT
LEE
IACOCCA
CAN
BITE
ME
BULLSHIT
WHOEVER
BACKS
EM
BEST
IS
JUST
AFRAID
THE
STUPID
THINGS
ARE
GOING
TO
FALL
APART
AND
NO
ONE
WILL
BUY
THEM
WITHOUT
ASSURANCE
WHY
THE
HELL
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
LH
HAS
BEEN
NICKNAMED
LAST
HOPE
YOU
CAN
DO
BETTER
AND
I
KNOW
PEOPLE
WILL
DISAGREE
WITH
ME
HERE
BUT
JAPANESE
LIKE
HONDA
OR
TOYOTA
OR
THE
ONLY
AMERICAN
CAR
COMPANY
THAT
I
FEEL
IS
A
QUALITY
PRODUCT
SATURN
I
WILL
NOT
TOUCH
ANOTHER
CHRYSLER
PRODUCT
AGAIN
NO
WAY
I
DONT
CARE
HOW
GOOD
THE
LH
CARS
LOOK
GOOD
AND
I
WILL
ADMIT
THEY
LOOK
PROMISING
BUT
NOT
WITH
THE
SUPPORT
THAT
YOU
GET
GM
ISNT
MUCH
BETTER
THANK
GOD
THEY
DONT
CONTROL
SATURN
LIKE
THEY
DO
THEIR
DIVISIONS
OR
IT
WOULD
BE
JUST
ANOTHER
MARKETING
PLOY
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
WILL
BE
WATCHING
MY
CAR
WHICH
I
DO
LIKE
LIKE
A
HAWK
FOR
THE
NEXT
YEARS
I
AM
MUCH
MORE
HESITANT
TO
SAY
IT
OR
ANY
CAR
IS
REALLY
GOOD
UNTIL
IT
HAS
PROVED
ITSELF
TO
ME
BUT
SINCE
SOMEONE
ELSE
POINTED
OUT
CD
AS
A
SOURCE
I
WILL
NOTE
BECAUSE
I
USED
TO
READ
THESE
MAGAZINES
THAT
CAR
AND
DRIVER
HAS
NEVER
HAD
A
GOOD
THING
TO
SAY
ABOUT
MOST
CHRYSLER
PRODUCTS
SHADOW
FOR
ONE
ALWAYS
WERE
THEY
MOANING
ABOUT
THE
REGURITATED
KCAR
AND
ENGINE
WHEREAS
MOTOR
TREND
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THEY
WERE
GREAT
CARS
NO
CAR
MAGAZINE
IS
REALLY
OBJECTIVE
AND
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
ALOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
LIKE
CONSUMERS
REPORTS
I
WILL
USE
THEM
TO
REINFORCE
MY
ARGUMENT
I
ALREADY
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
BIG
STINK
WITH
THE
SATURN
CRASH
TESTS
TIME
WILL
TELL
HOW
GOOD
A
CAR
THEY
ARE
THE
SHADOWSUNDANCE
RATE
MUCH
WORSE
THAN
AVERAGE
IN
FACT
NONE
OF
THE
CHRYSLERS
RATE
A
BETTER
THAN
AVERAGE
I
THINK
THE
BEST
ONE
IS
JUST
AVERAGE
EXCLUDING
THE
DIAMOND
STARMITSUBISHI
STUFF
AND
THE
LHS
YOU
CAN
FIND
BAD
STUFF
ABOUT
THE
SHADOW
TRY
AS
I
MIGHT
WHEN
I
RESEARCHED
THE
SATURN
I
COULD
NOT
FIND
ANYTHING
BAD
ABOUT
IT
THERE
IS
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THIS
COMPANY
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
IS
A
NEW
AMERICAN
COMPANY
AND
IT
HAS
CREATED
QUITE
A
STIR
IN
THE
AUTOMOTIVE
COMMUNITY
FOR
GOOD
REASON
MUCH
MORE
THAN
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
ANY
NEW
MODEL
LINES
OF
ANY
ESTABLISHED
COMPANY
I
READ
AN
ARTICLE
WHICH
HAD
A
SUBCOLUMN
AN
I
THINK
THIS
IMPRINTED
ON
ME
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
SOME
BIG
WIG
IN
TOYOTA
SAID
AND
I
QUOTE
WE
ARE
WATCHING
THEM
VERY
CLOSELY
COME
ON
EVERYBODY
GROW
UP
THE
FOREIGN
CARS
ESPECIALLY
THE
JAPANESE
HAVE
BEEN
KICKING
OUR
BUTTS
FOR
GOOD
REASON
THE
AMERICAN
CAR
COMPANIES
COULD
NOT
MAKE
A
GOOD
PRODUCT
OR
SUPPORT
THE
CUSTOMER
THE
WAY
THEY
WANT
THESE
DAYS
TO
SET
IN
THEIR
WAYS
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
SATURN
WAS
CREATED
THEY
ARE
STILL
STRUGGLING
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVENT
LEARNED
YET
THEY
HAVE
THE
ABILITY
THE
WORKERS
ARE
NOT
INFERIOR
THE
TECHNOLOGY
IS
NOT
OUT
OF
DATE
BUT
THEIR
ATTITUDE
IS
AND
THEY
ARE
JUST
FINDING
THIS
OUT
ITS
CALLED
COMPETITION

YOU

SATISFY

THE
