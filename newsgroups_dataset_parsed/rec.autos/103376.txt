WRITES
I
PERSONALLY
LIKE
THE
LOOKS
OF
THE
IMPALA
SS
THE
CAPRICE
WAS
DEFINATELY
WEIRD
LOOKING
UNTIL
THIS
YEAR
WHEN
THEY
MADE
THE
REAR
WHEEL
OPENINGS
LOOK
MORE
LIKE
A
NORMAL
CAR
BUT
THE
IMPALA
IMPRESSES
ME
GM
CANT
EXACTLY
SHOVE
THE
IN
EVERYTHING
THEY
MAKE
YOU
KNOW
ONLY
THE
BIGGER
STUFF
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
IT
NEXT
IN
A
SERIES
PICKUP
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
HOT
SETUP
WHAT
ABOUT
IN
A
FULL
SIZE
BLAZER
AS
WELL
WOULD
THIS
ENGINE
HAVE
THE
GOBS
OF
TORQUE
NECESSARY
FOR
OFFROADING
IF
SO
THIS
WOULD
BE
EVEN
BETTER
THAN
THE
SYCLONE
WELL
AN
BLAZER
WOULDNT
COME
CLOSE
TO
A
GMC
TYPHOON
IN
SPEED
I
THINK
ITS
TOO
HEAVY
AS
IT
IS
RIGHT
NOW
THE
NORMAL
ENGINE
HAS
PLENTY
OF
POWER
FOR
A
FULL
SIZE
BLAZER
OF
COURSE
IM
NOT
SAYING
GM
SHOULDNT
PUT
THE
IN
IT
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
THEY
HAVE
A
REAL
WINNER
WITH
THAT
ENGINE
WHY
SPEND
SO
MUCH
MORE
MONEY
INTO
GETTING
A
VALVE
DOHC
WHEN
YOU
CAN
TAKE
AN
IT
EVEN
SEEMS
TO
GET
PRETTY
GOOD
GAS
MPG
FOR
A
THAT
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
IMPALA
SS
WILL
THIS
BE
IN
THE
CAPRICE
BODY
IM
JUST
CURIOUS
IF
CHEVY
IS
TRYING
TO
RESURRECT
THEIR
MUSCLE
CARS
OR
TO
COMPETE
WITH
THE
EUROPEAN
SUPER
SEDANS
YEAH
ITS
A
FLAT
BLACK
LOWERED
DOOR
CAPRICE
RIDING
ON
ALUMINUM
RIMS
AND
EAGLE
GSC
TIRES
THE
REST
OF
THE
CAR
IS
BASICALLY
A
CAPRICE
LTZ
READ
PLUSH
POLICE
PACKAGE
WITH
HORSEPOWER
I
HEARD
THAT
CHEVY
IS
RESURRECTING
THE
MONTE
CARLO
BUT
THATS
GOING
TO
GET
THEIR
DOHC
