re
did
us
drive
on
the
left
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
i
went
to
a
classic
car
meet
here
in
the
uk
and
saw
a
very
nice
old
de
soto
vintage
id
guess
with
wooden
artillery
type
wheels
etc
but
it
was
righthand
drive
i
cant
believe
that
desoto
produced
rhd
cars
just
for
the
uk
well
sweden
and
australia
and
lord
knows
wherever
else
used
to
drive
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
so
the
export
market
might
have
been
larger
then
than
just
the
uk
im
guessing
but
i
believe
in
the
twenties
we
probably
drove
mostly
down
cattle
trails
and
in
wagon
ruts
i
am
fairly
sure
that
placement
of
the
steering
wheel
was
pretty
much
arbitrary
to
the
company
at
that
time
by
the
there
was
a
very
active
good
roads
movement
which
had
its
origins
actually
in
the
during
the
bicycle
craze
picked
up
steam
in
the
teens
witness
the
linclon
highway
association
or
so
and
the
us
highway
support
act
real
name
something
different
in
that
first
pledged
federal
aid
to
states
and
counties
to
build
decent
roads
also
the
experience
of
widespread
use
of
trucks
for
domestic
transport
during
ww
convinced
the
government
that
good
raods
were
crucial
to
our
national
defense
anyway
by
the
there
were
plenty
of
good
roads
at
least
around
urban
areas
and
they
were
rapidly
expanding
into
the
countryside
this
was
the
era
after
all
of
the
first
auto
touring
fad
the
motel
the
auto
camp
ground
etc

i
forget
also
any
of
john
flinks
or
john
bell
raes
auto
histories
as
to
placement
of
the
steering
wheel
being
arbitrary
by
the
early
teens
there
were
virtually
no
american
cars
that
did
not
have
the
wheel
on
the
left
in
the
early
days
cars
had
the
wheel
on
the
left
on
the
right
and
even
in
the
middle
as
well
as
sometimes
having
a
tiller
instead
of
a
wheel
this
was
standardized
fairly
early
on
though
i
dont
know
why

history

to

whether
we
can
comprehend
and
prove
it
or
not
