DRIVE
ON
THE

THE
REASON
I
ASK
IS
BECAUSE
I
WENT
TO
A
CLASSIC
CAR
MEET
HERE
IN
THE
UK
AND
SAW
A
VERY
NICE
OLD
DE
SOTO
VINTAGE
ID
GUESS
WITH
WOODEN
ARTILLERY

WHEELS
ETC

IT
WAS
RIGHTHAND

I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
DESOTO
PRODUCED
RHD
CARS
JUST
FOR
THE
UK
WELL
SWEDEN
AND
AUSTRALIA
AND
LORD
KNOWS
WHEREVER
ELSE
USED
TO
DRIVE
ON
THE
WRONG
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
SO
THE
EXPORT
MARKET
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
LARGER
THEN
THAN
JUST
THE
UK
IM
GUESSING
BUT
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
TWENTIES
WE
PROBABLY
DROVE
MOSTLY
DOWN
CATTLE
TRAILS
AND
IN
WAGON
RUTS
I
AM
FAIRLY
SURE
THAT
PLACEMENT
OF
THE
STEERING
WHEEL
WAS
PRETTY
MUCH
ARBITRARY
TO
THE
COMPANY
AT
THAT
TIME
BY
THE
THERE
WAS
A
VERY
ACTIVE
GOOD

WHICH
HAD
ITS

THAT

WERE
CRUCIAL
TO
OUR
NATIONAL

ANYWAY
BY
THE
THERE
WERE
PLENTY
OF
GOOD
ROADS
AT
LEAST
AROUND
URBAN
AREAS
AND
THEY
WERE
RAPIDLY
EXPANDING
