I
HAVE
FOUND
A
KIT
ADVERTISED
FOR
LOWERING
THE
FRONT
END
OF
AN
EARLY
MUSTANG
INSTALLATION
ENVOLVES
MOVING
THE
UPPER
AARM
AND
INSTALLATION
OF
A
WEDGE
SHAPED
SPACER
BETWEEN
THE
AARM
AND
BALL
JOINT
APPARENTLY
SHELBY
MUSTANGS
DID
A
SIMILAIR
MODIFICATION
BUT
LEFT
OUT
THE
SPACER
I
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
IN
FEEDBACK
PRO
OR
CON
ON
SUCH
A
MODIFICATION
IM
NO
MUSTANG
HEAD
BUT
DONT
THE
EARLY
ONES
HAVE
A
SIMPLE
STRUT
SUSPENSION
THAT
IS
WITH
NO
UPPER
AARM
JUST
A
STRUT
GOING
DOWN
TO
A
LOWER
CONTROL
ARM
SINGLE
BUSHING
NOT
AN
AARM
WITH
A
TENSIONCOMPRESSION
ROD
LOCATING
IT
IN
THE
FORWARDBACKWARD
DIRECTION
ANYWAY
SIMPLE
STRUT
SUSPENSIONS
LIKE
THIS
CAN
BE
LOWERED
JUST
BY
USING
SHORTER
SPRINGS
CUTTING
THE
SPRINGS
LOWERING
THE
SPRING
PERCH
OR
SHORTENING
THE
STRUT
BELOW
THE
PERCH
IN
EACH
OF
THESE
CASES
THE
SUSPENSION
GEOMETRY
WILL
SUFFER
BECAUSE
THE
LOWER
CONTROL
ARMS
WILL
NOT
BE
AT
THE
INTENDED
ANGLE
A
SPACER
PLACED
BETWEEN
CONTROL
ARM
AND
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
STRUT
ROUGHLY
THE
HEIGHT
OF
THE
REDUCTION
WILL
RESTORE
THE
SUSPENSION
GEOMETRY
IMHO
THE
KIT
THAT
INCLUDES
THE
SPACER
IS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
GO
KEN
KEN

DYE
