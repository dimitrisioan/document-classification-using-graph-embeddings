none
of
the
configurations
are
perfectly
inherently
balanced
which
is
what
i
was
talking
about
balance
shafts
and
mass
on
either
ends
of
the
cranks
can
eliminate
these
forcesmoments
which
is
something
i
also
pointed
out
and
didnt
you
also
say
that
it
was
easier
to
add
masses
than
to
add
balance
shafts
the
sad
truth
is
that
some
makers
dont
bother
to
put
balance
shafts
on
their
big
shaky
the
three
cranks
i

how
about
if
this
is
ridiculous
kindly
explain
why
its
been
more
than
years
since
i
studied
this
stuff
flat
and
both
have
the
potential
to
be
nearly
vibration
free
because
subaru
does
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
in
general
or
porsche
i
think
subaru
somehow
connecting
themselves
to
porsche
is
an
absurdity
and
im
not
a
porsche
fan
big
wing
dings
these
configurations
overhead
cams
etc
etc
etc
have
been
around
for
nearly
years
the
point
that
they
are
trying
to
make
is
that
while
everybody
settles
for
the
orthodox
inline
they
are
using
a
horizontally
opposed
which
is
unique
in
that
market
segment
and
porsche
also
uses
a
flat
six
in
their
so
whats
the
problem
i
dont
see
any
claim
that
their
engine
is
as
good
as
a
porsches
they
are
simply
pointing
out
that
they
use
the
same
configuration
as
a
porsche
if
you
want
to
nitpick
ad
campaigns
i
think
there
are
far
more
blatant
excesses
than
this
eliot
