SUCK
IN
THE
SNOW
I
HAVE
AGGRESSIVE
SNOWS
PLUS
A
HUNDRED
POUNDS
OF
SAND
IN
THE
BACK
AND
I
STILL
TRY
TO
AVOID
DRIVING
IN
THE
SNOW
I
HAPPILY
TOOK
THE
SAAB
THROUGH
BLIZZARD
CONDITIONS
WITHOUT
A
WORRY
I
WOULD
SAY
THIS
IS
THE
SINGLE
DESIGN
FLAW
IN
THE
BMW
FOR
A
REASONABLE
SUM
YOU
CAN
GET
A
BMW
WITH
TRACTION
CONTROL
A
TORQUESENSING
LIMITED
SLIP
REAR
DIFFERENTIAL
SINCE
NO
FWD
CAR
INCLUDING
THE
SAAB
HAS
THIS
KIND
OF
FRONT
DIFFERENTIAL
SINCE
IT
WOULD
EXACERBATE
TORQUE
STEER
A
BMW
WITH
TRACTION
CONTROL
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
THEORETICAL
ADVANTAGE
ON
SNOW
OF
COURSE
WEIGHT
DISTRIBUTION
AND
SKINNY
TIRES
COULD
