STILL
DO
DRIVE
ON
THE
WRONG
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
I
BELIEVE
SWEDEN
CHANGED
IN
THE
WAY
I
HEARD
IT
WAS
THAT
THEY
SWAPPED
ALL
THE
TRAFFIC
SIGNS
AROUND
ONE
SUNDAY
AS
I
LIVE
IN
SWEDEN
I
REMEMBER
THE
DAY
PERFECTLY
WELL
WE
CHANGED
SIDE
OR
I
DONT
REMEBER
THE
EXACTLY
TIME
BUT
IT
WAS
IN
THE
NIGHT
IN
THE
BIG
CITIES
LIKE
STOCKHOLM
GOTHENBURG
ALL
TRAFIC
WAS
FORBIDDEN
EXEPT
BUSSES
AND
TAXIS
DURING
THE
WHOLE
WEEKEND
THE
DAY
WAS
A
SUNDAY
AND
EVERYTHING
WAS
PREPARED
IN
BEFORE
BEFORE
THE
DAY
WE
WAS
TOLD
TO
FOLLOW
THE
YELLOW
LINES
ON
THE
ROAD
AND
AFTER
IT
WAS
THE
WHITE
ONE
THAT
MATTERS
THE
SIGNS
WITH

ON
WAS
PREPARED
WITH
A
LEFT
MODE
LABEL
THAT
WAS
TORN
OFF
THAT
NIGHT
TO
REVEAL
THE
NEW

PRACTICALLY
ALL

THEIR

EVEN
THE

MORE
CONTRIES

JAPAN
TANZANIA

THINK
NEW
ZEELAND
HOW
ABOUT
SOUTH
AFRICA
BTW
SOME
SAIS
THAT
THE
LEFT
SIDE
IS
THE
