the
big
disadvantage
of
automatics
is
the
hp
they
consume
that
never
gets
to
the
wheels
in
this
respect
they
are
at
a
disadvantage
to
a
manual
only
when
the
torque
converter
is
not
locked
up
there
are
autos
out
there
with

gears
wrt
performance
converter
lockup
is
purely
irrelevant
the
lockup
only
occurs
at
light
throttle
settings
and
serves
only
to
improve
mpg
mind
you
a
converter
clutch
does
a
lovely
job
of
improving
mpg
but
the
additional
mechanical
advantage
of
the
converter
gives
you
more
acceleration
vs
locked
converter
clutch
than
its
inherent
losses
take
away
