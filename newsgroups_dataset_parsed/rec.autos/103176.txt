THIS
HAS
BEEN
DISCUSSED

DEATH

INFO
MIKE

I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
WRITTEN
DATA
BUT
I
KNOW
WHAT
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
I
USE
IN
EVERYTHING
INCLUDING
MY
LAWNMOWERS
IN
MY
CAR
IT
SMOOTHED
THE
IDLE
AND
REDUCED
THE
OPERATING
TEMP
BY
DEGREES
I
HAVENT
USED
IT
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
TEST
FOR
WEAR
BUT
SOME
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
HAVE
A
FARMER
THAT
LIVES
NEAR
BY
USED
TO
HAVE
TO
OVERHAUL
HIS
BIG
DEISEL
TRACTORS

EVERY

USING
HE
HAS
WENT
YEARS
WITHOUT
AN
OVERHAUL
ALSO
A
FRIEND
AT
A
MACHINE
SHOP
HAS
IN
THE
PAST
REBUILT
ENGINES
WITH
MILES
ON
THEM
BECAUSE
THE
COUSTOMER
THOUGHT
IT

TIME
THESE
COUSTOMERS
HAD
RAN
SINCE
ALMOST
NEW
IT
WAS
FOUND
WHEN
MEASURING
THE
INTERNALS
OF
THE
ENGINE
THAT
THEY
SHOWED
ONLY
ABOUT
THE
AMOUNT
OF
WEAR
THAT
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
OF
MILES
NOT
IN
MY
OPINION
IT
WORKS
BEWARE
THE
CAT
IS
ON
THE
PROWEL
