ITS
A

W
MAHAN
SAYS
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
LOVE
TO
DRIVE
IN
THE
LEFT
LANE
FAST
BUT
WHEN
I
OVERTAKE
CARS
WHO
ARE
ON
THE
RIGHT
I
SLOW
DOWN
A
TAD
BIT
IF
I
WERE
TO
RELY
ON
THE
JUDGEMENT
OF
THE
OTHER
CAR
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
I
WOULD
BE
THE
STUPID
ONE
JUST
TO
SATIATE
MY
CURIOSITY
WHY
WOULD
THIS
MAKE
YOU
THE
STUPID
ONE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
EVERYBODY
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
ENOUGH
OF
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
YOU
DO
NOT
NEED
I
COULDNT
AGREE
MORE
THAT
IS
HOW
IT
SHOULD
WORK
PEOPLE
SHOULD
ALSO
ALWAYS
SEE
MOTORCYCLES
TOO
I
CONSTANTLY
SCAN
BEHIND
ME
I
HAVE
ONE
OF
THOSE
WINK
MIRRORS
AND
TWO
OUTSIDE
MIRRORS
I
ACTUALLY
SPEND
JUST
AS
MUCH
TIME
CHECKING
MY
SIX
COPS
YOU
KNOW
I
STILL
GET
CAUGHT
OFF
GUARD
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
MAYBE
I
DIDNT
WORD
IT
RIGHT
THE
FIRST
TIME
WHAT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
WAS
THAT
IF
YOU
PLAN
TO
BLOW
BY
SOMEBODY
AT
A
VERY
HIGH
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
AND
YOU
ASSUME
YOU
ARE
SAFE
BECAUSE
THE
GUY
SEES
YOU
YOU
ARE
STUPID
OF
COURSE
IT
DEPENDS
ON
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
HAVE
HAD
SOME
VERY
SCARY
INSTANCES
WHEN
I
ASSUMED
THIS
AND
I
DONT
THINK
ALL
OF
THE
FAULT
WAS
THE
OTHER
GUY
NOW
IF
HE
WAS
GOING
IN
A
THATS
A
WHOLE
DIFFERENT
STORY
OK
I
CAN
AGREE
TO
THIS
BECAUSE
AS
WE
HAVE
BOTH
PROVED
WHAT
IS
IDEALLY
SUPPOSED
TO
HAPPEN
ISNT
ALWAYS
AND
EVEN
THOUGH
IM
REARELY
THE
ONE
DOING
THE
PASSING
I
DONT
SEE
WHERE
IT
MAKES
YOU
STUPID
BUT
I
AGREE
THAT
IF
YOU
THINK
YOU
ARE
SAFE
BECAUSE
THE
OTHER
GUY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
PAYING
ATTENTION
THEN
YES
YOU
ARE
JUST
AS
DUMB
AS
THE
OTHERMAYBE
DUMBER
HASTA
DREW
