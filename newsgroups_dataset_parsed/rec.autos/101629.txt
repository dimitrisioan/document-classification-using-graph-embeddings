MORE
GAUGES
A
BIT
STRETCHED
ETC
LOTS
OF

EQUIPMENT
THE
WORKS
COLOR
SELECTION
IS
LIMITED
THOUGH
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
GUY
AT
PENN

IS
ABOUT
TO
GET
IT
PRES
CLINTON
LAST
TIME
IT
WAS
A
LINCOLN
THIS
TIME
A

I
KNOW
GM
DOES
CONVERSION
WORK
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
HOT
CLIMATES
IE
THE
CHEVY
CAPRICES

THE
MIDDLE
EAST
BUT
THINGS
LIKE
THAT
ARE
ALWAYS
DONE
BY
THIRD

NOT
THE
MANUFACTURER
MAYBE
YOU
WILL
NEED
TO
BUY
A
SPECIFIC
PACKAGE
