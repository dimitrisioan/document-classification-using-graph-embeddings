hi
there
ive
recently
been
toying
with
the
idea
of
purchasing
an
old
the
going
rate
seems
to
be
about
for
cars
with
anywhere
from
mi
my
question
is
this
what
should
i
expect
at
this
price
should
i
expect
to
have
extensive
body
work
done
what
about
engine
transmission
should
i
likewise
expect
to
have
both
virtually
replaced
along
those
lines
does
anyone
have
the
names
addresses
of
any
mailorder
parts
suppliers
for
everything
from
engine
to
body
parts
im
completely
new
to
the
area
of
restoring
cars
and
as
i
dont
actually
do
any
work
with
cars
most
of
the
work
would
have
to
be
professionally
done
what
sould
i
expect
the
cost
of
upgrading
a
to
a
rustfree
mechanically
sound
automobile
thanks
in
advance
andre
true
enthusiasts
will
be
able
to
give
you
a
better
answer
then
this
but
ill
dump
my
impressions
ive
wanted
to
own
a
for
about
years
now
came
close
once
but
i
ended
up
buying
a
fiero
instead
biggest
mistake
of
my
life
anyway
for
you
should
be
able
to
get
a
nice
car
but
your
also
set
in
the
price
range
to
get
taken
by
a
nice
looker
that
is
a
pile
of
shit
the
most
common
total
failure
for
the
car
would
be
frame
rust
between
the
engine
and
passenger
compartment
also
look
for
chassis
welded
together
here
oh
yeah
the
price
range
you
are
talking
about
must
be
the
banger
a
if
you
could
find
one
would
be
mucho
more
bucks
parts
for
the
engine
are
pretty
easy
to
come
by
for
an
old
car
and
you
can
even
locate
crude
in
the
jc
whitney
catalog
if
you
have
too
the
machine
itself
is
pretty
simple
they
use
the
spare
tire
for
windshild
washer
instead
of
a
pump
fer
chris
sake
so
getting
it
fixed
by
a
good
bugporsche
mechanic
would
be
easy
since
it
is
midengine
you
may
spend
more
on
labor
for
any
mechanical
work
