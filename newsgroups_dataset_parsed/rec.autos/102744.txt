SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS
FROM
MIKEWCANCBYUEDU
MD
MIKE
WIEDA
HOWDY
IM
A
LITTLE
NEW
TO
THIS
NEWSGROUP
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TAP
SOME
OF
THE
KNOWLEDGE
AND
EXPERTISE
AVAILABLE
HERE
THE
SUBJECT
AFTERMARKET
CRUISE
CONTROLS
THE
BACKGROUND
I
RECENTLY
BROKE
MY
ANKLE
IN
A
ROADBICYCLING
ACCIDENT
PLACES
FIVE
SCREWS
YUK
IN
TWO
WEEKS
I
WILL
BE
RETURNING
TO
TEXAS
MY
HOME
FROM
MY
SCHOOL
BYU
IN
PROVO
UTAH
AS
YOU
CAN
IMAGINE
TRYING
TO
DRIVE
NEARLY
MILES
WITH
A
BROKEN
RIGHT
ANKLE
ISNT
JUST
THE
EPITOME
OF
A
GOOD
TIME
MY
CAR
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
CRUISE
CONTROL
SO
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
DO
ALL
THE
PEDALLING
HA
HA
WITH
MY
MESSEDUP
ANKLE
MY
QUESTION
WHAT
IS
THE
GENERAL
OPINION
OF
AFTERMARKET
CRUISE
CONTROL
UNITS
I
REALIZE
THAT
A
CHEAP
CC
CRUISE
CONTROL
FROM
SAY
PEP
BOYS
ISNT
GOING
TO
BE
AS
GOOD
AS
A
FACTORY
OR
PROFESSIONALLY
INSTALLED
UNIT
IF
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
THING
AND
I
UDERSTAND
THAT
I
PROBABLY
CANT
EXPECT
MUCH
IN
THE
WAY
OF
ACCURACY
LOOKS
AND
THAT
SORT
OF
THING
BUT
ANYTHINGS
GOTTA
BE
BETTER
THAN
TRYING
TO
DRIVE
WITH
A
HOSED
ANKLE
I
HAVE
A
JEEP
CHEROKEE
SPEED
STANDARD
ENGINE
WITH
KETTERINGSP
IGNITION
YKNOW
DISTRIBUTOR
CAP
ROTOR
THAT
SETUPNOT
ELECTRONIC
MAYBE
YOU
COULDVE
GUESSED
IT
BEING
AN
BUT
IM
JUST
TRYING
TO
GIVE
INFORMATION
AS
COMPLETLY
AS
I
CAN
I
FOUND
A
CC
UNIT
FOR
BUCKS
IT
SEEMS
TO
USE
THE
VEHICLES
VACUUM
SYSTEM
INSTEAD
OF
AN
ELECTRIC
SERVORMOTOR
IS
THIS
GOOD
OR
BAD
IF
I
DID
BUY
THIS
CC
WHICH
VACUUM
HOSE
SHOULD
I
TAP
IT
HAS
TWO
SPEED
SENSORS
ONE
MAGNETIC
AND
ONE
THAT
GETS
A
SIGNAL
FROM
THE
NEGATIVE
SIDE
OF
THE
DISTRIBUTOR
KINDA
LIKE
A
TACH
PICKUP
OR
SO
I
UNDERSTAND
I
CAN
USE
EITHER
ONE
WHICH
IS
BEST
THE
MANUAL
SAYS
I
READ
IT
IN
THE
STORE
TODAY
THAT
THE
MAGNETICAXLE
SETUP
IS
MORE
ACCURATE
BUT
HARDER
TO
INSTALL
IS
THERE
REALLY
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
IT
HAS
A
SENSOR
FOR
THE
BRAKE
PEDAL
JUST
LIKE
OTHER
CCS
BUT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
SENSOR
FOR
THE
CLUTCH
PEDAL
SO
IF
I
WASNT
PAYING
REAL
CLOSE
ATTENTION
I
MIGHT
PUSH
THE
CLUTCH
IN
WHILE
THE
CRUISE
IS
TRYING
TO
GET
THE
SPEED
UP
WHICH
WOULD
WIND
THE
ENGINE
UP
KINDA
HIGH
UNTIL
I
GOT
MY
WITS
ABOUT
ME
AND
TURNED
THE
THING
OFF
IM
PRETTY
COORDINATED
SO
THIS
DOESNT
BOTHER
ME
IF
IT
WERE
FOR
MY
GIRLFRIENDS
CAR
THEN
IT
WOULD
BOTHER
ME
BUT
IM
OK
WITH
IT
THE
INSTALLATION
ALSO
CALLS
FOR
AN
ATTACHMENT
TO
A
STEADYON
BRAKE
SIGNAL
AND
A
SWITCHEDON
BRAKE
SIGNAL
I
THINK
I
CAN
GET
A
SWITCHED
BRAKE
SIGNAL
FROM
THE
CORRECT
SIDE
OF
THE
BRAKE
LIGHT
BLADE
FUSE
AM
I
RIGHT
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
WHERE
TO
GET
THE
STEADYON
BRAKE
SIGNAL
OR
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WHAT
EXACTLY
IT
IS
ANY
IDEAS
AS
TO
WHAT
THE
MANUFATURER
WANTS
AND
WHERE
TO
GET
IT
I
THINK
I
CAN
FIGURE
THE
OTHER
THINGS
OUT
LIKE
HOW
TO
HOOKUP
THE
NEGATIVE
SIDE
TACHTYPE
SENSING
GIZMO
AND
THE
CABIN
CONTROL
UNIT
AND
THE
GROUND
AND
ALL
THAT
MISCELLANEOUS
BUSINESS
BUT
I
NEED
A
LITTLE
HELP
WITH
IS
IT
WORTH
THE
MONEY
AND
SAFETY
RISK
IF
ANY
FOR
SUCH
A
DEVICE
IS
THERE
ANY
PARTICULARLY
GOOD
AFTERMARKET
CC
ARE
PROFESSIONALLY
INSTALLED
CCS
SIGNIFACANTLY
BETTER
AND
WORTH
THE
CABBAGE
IF
THE
UNIT
I
SAW
SORRY
NO
MANUFACTURER
OR
MODEL
NUMBER
JUST
THAT
IT
IS
AT
PEP
BOY
AND
ITS
IS
SUFFICIENT
FOR
MY
SIMPLE
NEEDS
HOW
DO
I
GET
THE
THING
INSTALLED
PROPERLY
SPECIFICALLY
THE
QUESTIONS
ABOVE
MY
FATHER
AND
I
BUILT
A
VEEP
VOLKSWAGEN
POWERED
JEEP
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
HIGH
SCHOOL
SO
I
CONSIDER
MYSELF
FAIRLY
GOOD
WITH
TOOLS
ELECTRONICS
AND
CARS
SO
THE
INSTALLATION
DOESNT
SCARE
ME
I
JUST
WANT
TO
BE
CERTAIN
THAT
I
GET
THE
THING
INSTALLED
CORRECTLY
AS
MY
CHEROKEE
IS
JUST
A
WEE
BIT
MORE
COMPLICATED
THAN
MY
VEEP
I
APPRECIATE
YOUR
TIME
IN
READING
MY
POST
AND
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
EXPERTISE
OR
OPINION
ANYBODY
HAS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
IF
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SHARE
SOME
OF
YOUR
WISDOM
PLEASE
EMAIL
AS
I
DONT
GET
OVER
THIS
GROUP
VERY
OFTEN
BUT
I
CHECK
MY
MAIL
ALL
THE
TIME
AGAIN
THANKS
FOR
ANY
HELP
ANYONE
MAY
HAVE
