RE
IMPROVEMENTS
IN
AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSIONS
AN
EXCELLENT
AUTOMATIC
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
THE
SUBARU
LEGACY
IT
SWITCHES
TO
SPORT
MODE
WHEN
THE
ELECTRONICS
FIGURE
IT
NOT
WHEN
THE
DRIVER
SETS
THE
SWITCH
WHICH
IS
THE
PROPER
WAY
TO
DO
IT
IMO
SO
WHAT
DOES
SPORT
MODE
ENTAIL
SEVERAL
THINGS
REVVING
TO
RED
LINE
OR
TO
THE
REV
LIMITER
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
LEGACY
DELAYED
UPSHIFTS
IE
IF
YOU
LIFT
OFF
BRIEFLY
IT
WILL
REMAIN
IN
THE
LOW
GEAR
THIS
IS
HANDY
IF
YOU
ARE
CHARGING
THROUGH
CORNERS
AND
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DO
WITHOUT
THE
DISTRACTION
OF
UPSHIFTS
WHEN
THERES
ANOTHER
CURVE
APPROACHING
PART
THROTTLE
DOWNSHIFTS
BASED
ON
THE
SPEED
AT
WHICH
THE
PEDAL
IS
DEPRESSED
RATHER
THAN
THE
POSITION
OF
THE
PEDAL
MODERN
ELECTRONICS
CAN
MEASURE
THIS
VERY
EASILY
AND
SWITCH
TO
SPORT
MODE
THIS
IS
WONDERFUL
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
CHARGE
THROUGH
A
GREEN
LIGHT
ABOUT
TO
TURN
RED
MY
AUDI
SENSES
THIS
VERY
WELL
AND
CAN
DOWNSHIFT
ON
AS
LITTLE
AS
HALF
THROTTLE
IF
MY
RIGHT
FOOT
IS
FAST
ENOUGH
ALSO
I
THINK
THAT
A
SMART
AUTOMATIC
CAN
DELIVER
BETTER
GAS
MILEAGE
THAN
A
DUMB
DRIVER
WITH
A
STICK
ALL
ELSE
BEING
EQUAL
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
IDEA
OF
A
STICK
BEING
MORE
ECONOMICAL
THAN
AN
AUTOMATIC
MAKES
A
BIG
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
DRIVER
IS
SMART
ENOUGH
TO
KNOW
WHAT
GEAR
TO
USE
FOR
EACH
SITUATION
HOW
MANY
TIMES
HAVE
YOU
RIDDEN
WITH
AN
INATTENTIVE
DRIVER
CRUISING
ON
THE
HIGHWAY
AT
IN
GEAR
OF
A
SPEED
HOW
MANY
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
DRIVE
MANUALS
REALLY
KNOW
WHAT
THE
BEST
GEAR
TO
USE
IS
FOR
EVERY
CONCEIVABLE
SITUATION
IM
SURE
THERE
WILL
BE
SOME
WHO
KNOW
BUT
I
SUSPECT
THAT
A
CHIP
CONTROLLED
AUTOMATIC
WITH
ALL
POSSIBLE
SCENARIORATIO
COMBINATIONS
STORED
IN
ROM
IS
LIKELY
TO
DO
BETTER
I
CAN
ALSO
SAY
THAT
ALL
MY
PREVIOUS
ASSUMPTIONS
WERE
PROVED
WRONG
AFTER
I
GOT
A
CAR
WITH
INSTANTANEOUS
MPG
READOUT
HIGH
GEAR
LOW
REVS
AND
WIDE
OPEN
THROTTLE
IS
MORE
ECONOMICAL
THAN
LOW
GEAR
HIGH
REVS
AND
SMALL
THROTTLE
OPENING
THE
EXPLANATION
IS
QUITE
SIMPLE
IF
ONE
SITS
DOWN
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IT
BUT
NOT
THAT
OBVIOUS
AT
FIRST
SIGHT
ELIOT
