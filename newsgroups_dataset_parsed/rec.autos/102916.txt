wasnt
the
original
intent
of
the
reverse
lights
for
the
driver
so
he
could
see
where
he
was
backing
up
although
reverse
lights
on
the
sides
no
reverse
lights
are
to
warn
others
that
you
are
backing
up
they
arent
bright
enough
to
typically
see
by
without
the
brake
and
tail
lights
i
dont
know
where
you
live
but
i
couldnt
get
out
of
my
driveway
at
night
without
reverse
lights
as
someone
said
out
in
the
country
you
notice
neat
little
things
like
stars
and
the
difference
between
day
and
night
at
night
around
my
house
which
is
amongst
a
forest
of
rather
tall
oaks
it
is
dark
except
for
nights
with
full
moons
reverse
lights
illuminate
my
path
very
well
when
backing
up
i
greatly
prefer
cars
with
them
to
cars
without
operational
reverse
lights
