ANYONE
ELSE
EXPERIENCING
A
SIMILAR
PROBLEM
THIS
CONCERNS
THE
CLUTCH
ON
A
HONDA
ACCORD
SPEED
WHEN
THE
CLUTCH
IS
FIRST
USED
IN
THE
MORNING
ABOUT
THE
FIRST
MILES
OF
SHIFTING
THERE
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT
OF
CLUTCH
CHATTER
UNTIL
THINGS
WARM
UP
THEN
THE
CLUTCH
SHIFTS
SMOOTHLY
THIS
CHATTER
STARTED
WHEN
I
MOVED
TO
THE
SAN
FRANCISCO
BAY
AREA
FROM
A
LOWHUMIDITY
ENVIRONMENT
THE
DEALER
STATED
THAT
THIS
IS
KNOWN
TO
HAPPEN
SINCE
HONDA
CHANGED
FROM
AN
ASBESTOS
TO
NONASBESTOS
CLUTCH
MATERIAL
NO
REMEDY
SEEMS
THAT
MOISTURE
ON
CLUTCH
SURFACE
CAUSES
SLIPPING
UNTIL
THE
MOISTURE
EVAPORATES
ANY
COMMENTS
OUT
THERE
THE
CLUTCH
ON
MY
HONDA
CIVIC
EXV
EX
IN
THE
US
DOES
THIS
TOO
ITS
ANNOYING
NOW
THAT
I
THINK
ABOUT
IT
IS
WORSE
WHEN
THE
HUMIDITY
IS
HIGH
THE
DEALER
ALSO
CLAIMS
THERES
NOTHING
THEY
CAN
DO
SINCE
THE
CLUTCH
IS
A
SELFADJUSTING
HYDRAULIC
DESIGN
YEAH
RIGHT
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
I
SOLD
MY
CIVIC
VX
WAS
THE
CHATTERYGRABBY
CLUTCH
ALTHOUGH
I
DINT
NOTICE
IT
BEING
ANY
WORSE
IN
HUMID
WEATHER
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
ITS
ALWAYS
HUMID
AROUND
HERE
I
WAS
TOLD
BY
HONDA
THAT
IT
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
CHANGING
FROM
ASBESTOS
TO
NONASBESTOS
LININGS
WHICH
BEGAN
AROUND
SOMEONE
COULD
MAKE
SOME
GOOD
MONEY
SELLING
THE
OLDFASHION
VARIETY
IF
ITS
LEGAL
TO
MANUFACTURE
THEM
THESE
DAYS
MY
FEELING
IS
THAT
SINCE
MANY
OTHER
CAR
MAKERS
DO
NOT
HAVE
THIS
PROBLEM
THAT
ITS
A
POOR
DESIGN
OR
ENGINEERING
PROBLEM
ON
THE
PART
OF
HONDA
THREE
THINGS
TO
LOOK
OUT
FOR
ON
ALL
HONDA
PRODUCTS
CLUTCH
CHATTER
BAD
BRAKE
ROTORS
AND
RUSTY
EXHAUST
SYSTEMS
