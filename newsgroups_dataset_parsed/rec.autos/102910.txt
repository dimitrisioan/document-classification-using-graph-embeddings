JUST
VISITED
THE
NY
AUTO
SHOW
AND
SAW
TWO
LH
CARS
ON
THE
FLOOR
EAGLE
VISION
AND
DODGE
INTREPID
AT
A
COMPETITIVE
PRICE
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
WORKMANSHIP
IS
QUITE
DISAPPOINTING
ON
BOTH
CARS
THE
RUBBER
SEALS
AROUND
THE
WINDOW
AND
DOOR
FELL

UNFAIR
AS
IT
MAY
SEEM
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CHRYSLER

TOYOTA
IS
THAT
CHRYSLER
NEEDS
TO
PROVE
THAT
IT
CAN
BUILD
QUALITY

TOYOTA
CAN
AFFORD
MAKE
A
FEW
SMALL
MISTAKES
