WRITES
I
HAVE
HAD
TWO
WRANGLERS
AND
STILL
HAVE
THE
SECOND
RIGHT
NOW
ITS
A
WRANGLER
BASE
MODEL
WITH
THE
BIG
ENGINE
HARD
TOP
NO
POWER
STEERING
OR
AIR
CONDITIONING
RUNS
LIKE
A
TOP
HAS
ABOUT
ON
IT
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
IN
THE
SHOP
I
CAN
CHANGE
MY
OWN
OIL
NICE
TALL
VEHICLE
I
CAN
LUBE
IT
MYSELF
FITTINGS
I
OCCASIONALLY
TAKE
IT
TO
JIFFY
LUBE
TO
CHECK
THE
DIFFERENTIALS
AND
DO
THE
OIL
CHANGE
THERE
MY
PREVIOUS
WRANGLER
HAD
NARY
A
PROBLEM
EITHER
HERE
IN
COLORADO
THERE
MORE
JEEPS
THAN
BMWS
MERCEDES
VOLVOS
AND
THE
LIKE
TOGETHER
IN
FACT
JEEP
HAS
BEEN
CALLED
THE
COLORADO
CAR
FOR
A
WHILE
THEY
HOLD
THEIR
VALUE
WELL
AND
ARE
VERY
EASY
TO
RESELL
MINE
COST
RIGHT
AROUND
NEW
OF
COURSE
I
DIDNT
BLOW
MONEY
ON
AN
ISLANDER
SAHARA
OR
RENEGADE
WHICH
I
HAVE
A
WRANGLER
SAHARA
AND
PAID
NEW
INCLUDING
THE
REBATE
ARE
JUST
WRANGLERS
WITH
FANCY
INSIDE
STUFF
AFTER
DRIVING
A
FOR
YEARS
THAT
FANCY
STUFF
IS
PRETTY
NICE
THE
CARS
ARE
PRIMITIVE
RIDE
LIKE
A
DUMP
TRUCK
ETC
BUT
IF
YOU
LIVE
IN
AN
AREA
THAT
GETS
AROUND
OF
SNOW
PER
WINTER
YOUD
HAVE
ONE
TOO
THEYLL
GO
ANYWHERE
WITH
A
WINCH
AND
ARE
EASY
TO
GET
PARTS
FOR
THE
I
LIKE
MY
WRANGLER
BUT
WHEN
DOING
SOME
SERIOUS
OFF
ROADING
IT
CANT
KEEP
UP
WITH
A
BECAUSE
OF
GROUND
CLEARANCE
AND
LIMITED
SUSPENSION
TRAVEL
I
DO
HAVE
A
WINCH
AND
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
AN
ARB
AIRLOCKER
IN
THE
FUTURE
ENGINE
PUTS
OUT
HP
AND
GETS
AROUND
NOT
BAD
I
LOVE
THE
JUST
MY
EXPERIENCE
IM
SURE
THERE
ARE
BAD
ONES
OUT
THERE
BUT
THAT
GOES
FOR
ANY
MAKE
AND
MODEL
