i
have
had
two
wranglers
and
still
have
the
second
right
now
its
a
wrangler
base
model
with
the
big
engine
hard
top
no
power
steering
or
air
conditioning
runs
like
a
top
has
about
on
it
has
never
been
in
the
shop
i
can
change
my
own
oil
nice
tall
vehicle
i
can
lube
it
myself
fittings
i
occasionally
take
it
to
jiffy
lube
to
check
the
differentials
and
do
the
oil
change
there
my
previous
wrangler
had
nary
a
problem
either
here
in
colorado
there
more
jeeps
than
bmws
mercedes
volvos
and
the
like
together
in
fact
jeep
has
been
called
the
colorado
car
for
a
while
they
hold
their
value
well
and
are
very
easy
to
resell
mine
cost
right
around
new
of
course
i
didnt
blow
money
on
an
islander
sahara
or
renegade
which
i
have
a
wrangler
sahara
and
paid
new
including
the
rebate
are
just
wranglers
with
fancy
inside
stuff
after
driving
a
for
years
that
fancy
stuff
is
pretty
nice
the
cars
are
primitive
ride
like
a
dump
truck
etc
but
if
you
live
in
an
area
that
gets
around
of
snow
per
winter
youd
have
one
too
theyll
go
anywhere
with
a
winch
and
are
easy
to
get
parts
for
the
i
like
my
wrangler
but
when
doing
some
serious
off
roading
it
cant
keep
up
with
a
because
of
ground
clearance
and
limited
suspension
travel
i
do
have
a
winch
and
would
like
to
get
an
arb
airlocker
in
the
future
engine
puts
out
hp
and
gets
around
not
bad
i
love
the
just
my
experience
im
sure
there
are
bad
ones
out
there
but
that
goes
for
any
make
and
model
