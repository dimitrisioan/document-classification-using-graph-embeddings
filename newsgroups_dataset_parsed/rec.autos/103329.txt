re
questions
about
insurance
companies
esp
geico
radar
radio
association
defending
airwave
rights
says
that
geico
insurance
not
only
buys
radar
for
police
but
also
actively
lobbies
states
to
promote
making
radar
detectors
illegal
i
think
the
buying
part
is
a
misuse
of
money
but
the
radar
detector
part
shows
how
little
they
know
about
the
issue
no
study
i
am
aware
of
has
ever
concluded
that
detectors
have
a
negative
impact
on
safety
or
that
users
have
a
higher
average
speed
incompetence
by
geico
i
think
so

im
considering
switching
to
geico
insurance
but
have
heard
that
they
do
not
assign
a
specific
agent
for
each
policy
or
claim
i
was
worried
that
this
might
be
a
real
pain
when
you
make
a
claim
i
have
also
heard
that
they
try
to
get
rid
of
you
if
you
have
an
accident
ive
read
in
this
group
that
geico
has
funded
the
purchasing
of
radar
guns
by
police
depts
im
not
sure
where
