it
shouldnt
be
that
hard
if
you
know
much
about
digital
electronics
if
the
counter
is
made
with
standard
ttl
chips
all
you
should
need
to
do
is
find
the
chips
used
for
counting
figure
out
what
mileage
you
want
to
put
in
and
preset
it
but
wiring
the
preset
pins
directly
to
lowhigh
youd
also
have
to
know
what
the
conventions
are
for
low
and
high
it
might
be
a
little
more
involved
than
this
but
it
shouldnt
be
beyond
someone
with
a
bsee
or
bs
eet
all
the
display
does
is
convert
what
the
counter
chips
say
into
digits
using
a
translation
table
stored
in
rom
nobody
is
using
discrete
ics
to
do
these
functions
anymore
if
at
all
i
doubt
any
of
the
motor
electronics
had
any
to
start
with
much
less
ttl
i
can
almost
guarantee
that
itll
a
fruitless
attempt
to
figure
out
how
bmw
does
it
without
breaking
anything
and
invalidating
any
warranty
on
the
car
if
youre
lucky
youd
still
be
able
to
start
the
car
