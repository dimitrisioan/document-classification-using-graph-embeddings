GOOD
LUCK
IM
SORRY
I
LET
MINE
GO
I
GREW
UP
IN
NEW
YORK
CITY
SO
I
RODE
IN
MANY
CHECKER
CABS
THE
JUMP
SEATS
WERE
FUN
AS
A
KID
ALTHOUGH
THE
CARS
WERE
ROOMY
A
GOOD
TRAIT
FOR
A
TAXI
THEY
HAD
A
DESIGN
FLAW
THAT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THEY
NEVER
FIXED
THE
REAR
PASSENGERS
TENDED
TO
FALL
OUT
OF
THEIR
SEATS
WHEN
THE
DRIVER
BRAKED
I
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
TAKE
A
LONG
RIDE
IN
THE
BACK
SEAT
OF
ONE
OF
THESE
VEHICLES
WHY
DID
YOU
LIKE
YOURS
I
NEVER
DROVE
ONE
SO
I
HAVE
TO
ASK
