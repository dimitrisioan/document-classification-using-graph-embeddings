ashtrays
and
cigarette
lighters
these
should
be
an
option
why
make
it
an
option
you
can
use
the
ashtray
to
store
coins
and
other
small
things
which
come
in
handy
use
the
cigarette
lighter
as
an
electrical
outlet
for
all
types
of
handy
gadgets
cd
players
vacuum
cleaners
flashlights
etc
i
dont
want
to
pay
extra
for
these
things
and
if
you
dont
use
them
they
dont
hurt
you
i
use
the
ashtray
to
keep
change
and
other
items
in
i
converted
the
cigarette
lighter
into
a
volume
control
knob
for
my

fact
that
i
need
to
explain
it
to
you
indicates
that
you
probably
wouldnt
understand
anyway
