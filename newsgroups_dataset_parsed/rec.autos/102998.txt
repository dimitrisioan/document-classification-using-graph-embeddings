IM
LOOKING
FOR
INFORMATION
ON

NOW
YOU

WELL
THE
SAD
TRUTH

SURE

ITS
A
TWOSEATER

ROLLOVER
HEADLIGHTS
HARD
TOP
AND
REALLY
SPORTY
LOOKING
MY
FRIEND
HAS
ONE
SITTING
IN
HIS
YARD
IN
REALLY
NICE
CONDITION
BODYWISE
BUT
HE
TRANSMISSION
HAS
SEIZED
UP
ON
HIM
SO
IT
HASNT
RUN
FOR
A
WHILE
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
INFO
ON
THESE
CARS
THE
ENGINE
COMPARTMENT

REALLY
TIGHT

THIS

NOT
SOLD
THROUGH

A
LOT
MORE
LIKE
AN
OPEL
GT
TO
ME
ID
GUESS
THAT
THIS
IS
ON
THE
SAME
CHASSIS
AS
THE
KADETT
RATHER
THAN
THE
BIGGER
MANTA
BUT
I
COULD
EASILY
BE
WRONG
I
THINK
THE
LATER
KADETTS
WERE
SOLD
HERE
