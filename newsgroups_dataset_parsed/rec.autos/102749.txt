REPORT
DID
A
STUDY
I
THINK
AND
FOUND
THAT
MOST
TRUCKS
GOT
WORSE
MILEAGE
WITH
THE
TAILGATE
OFF
THE
TAILGATES
ON
THE
NEWER
TRUCKS
ACTUALLY
HELP
OH
SURE
THEY
DO
AND
REPLACING
THE
FRONT
BUMPER
AND
GRILLE
WITH
A
CLOSET
DOOR
HELPS
MILEAGE
AND
COOLING
IF
CR
ACTUALLY
SAID
THAT
THEN
THEY
HAVE
BIGGER
FOOLS
WORKING
FOR
THEM
THAN
THE
FOOLS
THAT
BELIEVE
THEIR
DRIVEL
BUT
WHO
AM
I
TO
ARGUE
THIS
JUST
SOMEONE
THATS
BEEN
A
PICKUPDRIVER
FOR
YEARS
THATS
ALL
FORGET
THE
NET
JUST
TAKE
OFF
THE
TAILGATE
ON
HIWAY
TRIPS
SINCE
THE
NETS
ARENT
DESIGNED
TO
NOR
CAPABLE
OF
RESTRAINING
A
LOAD
IN
THE
BED
ANYWAY
AROUND
TOWN
THE
TAILGATE
WILL
HAVE
A
NEGLIGABLE
EFFECT
ON
MILEAGE
ANYWAY
WALT
K
THEY
MAY
HELP
TO
IMPROVE
MILEAGE
IN
SOME
CASES
I
BELIEVE
WITH
THE
TAILGATE
ON
THE
FLOW
STRUCTURE
BEHIND
THE
CAB
MAY
DIFFER
AND
THE
VORTEX
DRAG
MAY
BE
REDUCED
DURING
HIGH
SPEED
DRIVING
HOW
ABOUT
THOSE
TONEAU
COVERS
IVE
BEEN
THINKING
OF
BUILDING
ONE

ANY
COMMENT
ON
HOW
THEY
AFFECT
MILEAGE
IN

CHARLES
WITHIN
THE
SPAN
OF
THE
LAST

I
HAVE
HEARD
ELEMENTS
OF
SEPARATE

IN

HAVE
BEEN
CONJOINED
IN

STRUCK
