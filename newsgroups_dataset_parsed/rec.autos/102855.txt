RE
OPEN
LETTER
TO
NISSAN
REALLY
STATION
WAGON
WITH
THE
POPULARITY
OF
MINIVANS
THE
MARKET
ROOM
FOR
STATION
WAGONS
IS
SQUEEZED
OUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
AS
COMFORTABLE
AS
SEDAN
AND
DONT
CARRY
AS
MUCH
AS
THE
MINIVANS
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
NOBODY
WANTS
THE
WAGON
ANYMORE
BUT
THE
DEMAND
IS
CERTAINLY
HAMPERED
BY
THE
MINIVAN
AND
MAY
NOT
BE
ECONOMICAL
TO
BUILD
A
PRODUCT
FOR
JASON
CHEN
A
STATION
WAGON
OWNER
