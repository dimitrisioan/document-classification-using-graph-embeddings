RE
ITS
A
RUSH
WAS
RE
TOO
FAST
WHY
SHOULD
A
GOOD
DRIVER
BE
TERRIFIED
AT
THE
ONLY
THING
I
FEAR
GOING
AT
ARE
DRIVERS
WHO
SWITCH
TO
THE
LEFT
LANE
WITHOUT
USING
EITHER
REARVIEWMIRROR
OR
FLASHERS
DOING
TO
AINT
A
RUSH
FOR
ME
BUT
ITS
FUN
AND
I
GET
WHERE
I
WANT
TO
GO
MUCH
FASTER
IN
DEFENSE
OF
THE
DRIVERS
WHO
ARE
IN
THE
RIGHT
LANE
HERE
IN
THE
STATES
PEOPLE
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
EXPECT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
DRIVING
TO
BE
OVERTAKEN
AT
A
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
OF
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
STUPID
OF
COURSE
THERE
ARE
EXCEPTIONS
THEY
ARE
JUST
PROGRAMMED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LIMIT
DO
YOU
IN
THE
STATES
WHEN
YOU
LOOK
IN
THE
REARVIEW
ALWAYS
CALCULATE
FUTURE
POSITIONS
OF
CARS
BASED
ON
A
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
LOVE
TO
DRIVE
IN
THE
LEFT
LANE
FAST
BUT
WHEN
I
OVERTAKE
CARS
WHO
ARE
ON
THE
RIGHT
I
SLOW
DOWN
A
TAD
BIT
IF
I
WERE
TO
RELY
ON
THE
JUDGEMENT
OF
THE
OTHER
CAR
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
SPEED
DIFFERENTIAL
I
WOULD
BE
THE
STUPID
ONE
BTW
IF
NO
ONE
ELSE
IS
AROUND
THEN
GO
FOR
IT
