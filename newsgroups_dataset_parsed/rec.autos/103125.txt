i
just
have
got
to
remind
all
of
you
that
this
is
it
yes
thats
right
somtime
this
fall
ford
the
granddaddy
of
cars
will
be
introducing
an
allnew
megacool
waytoofastforaccorddrivers
mustang
its
supposed
to
be
streamlined
looking
similar
to
the
mach
iii
concept
car
ford
came
out
with
around
january
i
cant
wait
anyone
out
there
hear
anything
about
it
recently
if
everything
ive
read
is
correct
ford
is
doing
nothing
but
re
skinning
the
existing
mustang
with
minor
suspension
modifications
and
the
pictures
ive
seen
indicate
they
didnt
do
a
very
good
job
of
it
the
new
mustang
is
nothing
but
a
recycle
of
a
year
old
car
jeff
gee
is
it
already
yes
it
will
still
be
on
the
fox
program
chasis
anything
that
will
be
different
on
the
new
car
as
far
as
mechanicals
is
unknown
the
suspension
will
most
likely
be
changed
as
well
as
the
drive
drain
from
what
has
been
printed
on
it
there
is
no
clear
idea
of
what
will
be
done
as
some
say
it
will
have
the
modular
and
others
the
current
small
block
just
have
to
wait
and
see
also
is
far
as
styling
goes
from
what
i
seen
is
good
a
return
to
tradition
c
scoop
on
the
sides
and
roof
line
much
like
a
or
fastback
