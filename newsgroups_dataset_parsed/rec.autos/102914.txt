WRITES
I
DELETED
YOUR
NAME
BECAUSE
I
DONT
WANT
TO
SOUND
ACCUSATIVE
IN
MY
REMARK
ON
ANOTHER
OCCASION
ON
MY
WAY
FROM
TEXAS
TO
FLORIDA
I
HAD
STOPPED
IN
A
SMALL
MOTEL
FOR
THE
NIGHT
IN
A
SMALL
TOWN
SOMEWHERE
IN
FLORIDA
ABOUT
YOUTHS
WERE
DISTURBING
MY
CAR
SETTING
OFF
THE
ALARM
AND
CHALLENGING
ME
TO
COME
OUT
WHEN
I
AND
ANOTHER
TENANT
WALKED
OUT
WITH
A
MAGNUM
AND
A
AUTOMATIC
RESPECTIVELY
THEY
VANISHED
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
I
IMMEDIATELY
PACKEDUP
AND
LEFT
WATCH
OUT
FOR
CARJACKING
AND
STAGED
ACCIDENTS
THEY
CAN
BE
DEADLY
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
ARGUE
THE
ISSUE
OF
CARRYING
WEAPONS
BUT
I
WOULD
ASK
YOU
IF
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
SERIOUSLY
ABOUT
SHOOTING
A
KID
FOR
SETTING
OFF
YOUR
ALARM
I
CAN
THINK
OF
WORSE
THINGS
IN
THE
WORLD
GLAD
YOU
GOT
OUT
OF
THERE
BEFORE
THEY
DID
ANYTHING
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
REASON
TO
FIRE
YOUR
GUN
IF
I
HEAR
SOMEONE
SCREWING
WITH
MY
CAR
IE
SETTING
OFF
THE
ALARM
AND
TAUNTING
ME
TO
COME
OUT
YOU
CAN
BE
DAMN
SURE
THAT
MY
COLT
DELTA
ELITE
WILL
ALSO
BE
COMING
WITH
ME
ITS
NOT
THE
SCREWING
WITH
THE
CAR
THATD
GET
THEM
SHOT
ITS
THE
POTENTIAL
PHYSICAL
DANGER
IF
THEYRE
TAUNTING
LIKE
THAT
ITS
VERY
POSSIBLE
THAT
THEY
ALSO
INTEND
TO
ROB
ME
ANDOR
DO
OTHER
PHYSICALLY
HARMFUL
THINGS
IF
THEYRE
JUST
SCREWING
AROUND
NO
HARM
DONE
IF
THEYRE
BENT
ON
MAYHEM
THEY
WILL
RECEIVE
THE
CURE
FOR
THEIR
LEAD
DEFICIENCY
A
INJECTION
FPSTHERES
NO
TELLING
WHAT
TODAYS
VIOLENT
CRIMINALS
WILL
DO
DEATH
MAY
BE
THE
MOST
PLEASANT
