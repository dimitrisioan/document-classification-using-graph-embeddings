remember
roads
in
america
are
not
designed
for
speeds
above
meaning
they
would
be
safe
at
roads
like
the
autobahn
are
smoother
straiter
wider

slightly
banked

speed
limits
in
nevada

wasnt
clear

roads
were
designed
for
speeds
of
or
so

at
when
they
were
built
in

account

kinds
of
cars
then
available
the
number
would
be
much
higher
today
because
the
cars
tires

everything
