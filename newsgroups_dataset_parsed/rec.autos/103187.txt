re
re
toyota
land
cruiser
worth
it
in
response
to
a
post
about
suvs
i
got
several
unsolicited
recommendations
to
check
out
the
land
cruiser
despite
its
astronomical
price
the
toyota
dealer
told
me
its
a
cult
car
if
a
car
is
good
enough
to
create
a
passionate
and
loyal
following
there
must
be
something
really
extraordinary
about
it
so
all
you
land
crusher
cultists
here
is
your
chance
to
convert

based
on
my
experience
with
a
the
hardtop
jeepstyle
model
i
would
definitely
give
a
new
model
consideration
if
i
were
in
the
market
the
older
models
are
very
well
built
unless
toyota
lost
its
mind
i
would
assume
until
proven
otherwise
that
the
newer
models
have
inherited
some
if
not
all
of
the
qualities
of
their
ancestors
two
major
differences
in
the
running
gear
that
im
aware
of
need
study
my
has
a
solid
front
axle
housing
whereas
the
newer
models
have
independant
front
suspension
the
solid
axle
is
theoretically
stronger
and
more
reliable
than
the
newer
model
but
only
experience
will
tell
the
independant
front
suspension
is
no
doubt
a
compromise
made
to
satisfy
the
typical
user
who
will
never
need
a
real
utility
vehicle
the
second
difference
is
the
type
of
transfer
case
used
on
the
newer
models
im
not
sure
but
i
think
tioyota
went
to
a
fulltime
or
allwheel
drive
system
the
older
landcruisers
have
a
lockup
type
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
