WRITES
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
CAN
SHED
ANY
LIGHT
ON
JUST
HOW
IT
IS
THAT
THESE
ELECTRONIC
ODOMETERS
REMEMBER
THE
TOTAL
ELAPSED
MILEAGE
WHAT
KIND
OF
MEMORY
IS
STABLERELIABLE
ENOUGH
NONVOLATILE
ENOUGH
AND
INDEPENDENT
ENOUGH
OF
OUTSIDE
BATTERY
POWER
TO
LAST
SAY
YEARS
OR
MORE
IN
THE
LIFE
OF
A
VEHICLE
IM
AMAZED
THAT
ANYTHING
LIKE
THIS
COULD
BE
EXPECTED
TO
WORK
FOR
THIS
LENGTH
OF
TIME
ESPECIALLY
IN
LIGHT
OF
ALL
THE
GIZMOS
I
WORK
WITH
THAT
ARE
DOING
GOOD
TO
WORK
FOR
MONTHS
WITHOUT
BREAKING
DOWN
SOMEHOW
FROM
THOMSOM
IT
HAS
A
TIMEKEEPER
CLOCK
AND
BYTES
OF
NVRAM
WHICH
HAS
A
LITHIUM
BATTERY
BACKUP
THE
BATTERY
HAS
A
LIFE
OF
YEARS
OF
POWEROFF
OPERATION
INSTALLED
IN
A
CAR
IT
COULD
BE
LEFT
POWERED
ON
CONTINUOUSLY
AND
NOT
DRAW
MUCH
CURRENT
THE
BATTERY
WOULD
ONLY
BE
USED
WHEN
YOUR
AUTO
BATTERY
WAS
DEAD
OR
HAD
BEEN
REMOVED
SIDE
QUESTION
HOW
ABOUT
THE
LEGAL
RAMIFICATIONS
OF
SELLING
A
USED
CAR
WITH
A
REPLACED
ODOMETER
THAT
STARTS
OVER
AT
MILES
AFTER
SAY
ACTUAL
MILES
LOOKS
LIKE
FRAUD
WOULD
BE
FAIRLY
EASY
FOR
THE
PRICE
OF
A
NEW
ODOMETER
YOU
CAN
SAY
IT
HAS
HOWEVER
MANY
MILES
YOU
WANT
TO
TELL
THE
BUYER
IT
HAS
IN
CALIFORNIA
THEY
HAVE
A
LINE
ON
THE
TRANSFER
OF
OWNERSHIP
FORM
WHICH
STATES
THAT
THE
ODOMETER
MILEAGE
IS
CORRECT
IF
INCORRECT
YOU
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
FILL
IN
WHAT
YOU
KNOW
OR
GUESSTIMATE
TO
BE
THE
CORRECT
MILEAGE
IF
YOU
LIE
ON
THIS
FORM
AND
ARE
CAUGHT
YOU
CAN
BE
PROSECUTED
AND
THE
BUYER
CAN
SUE
YOU
FOR
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
MILEAGE
DIFFERENTIAL
FASTER
HORSES
YOUNGER
WOMEN
OLDER
WHISKEY
MORE
MONEY
