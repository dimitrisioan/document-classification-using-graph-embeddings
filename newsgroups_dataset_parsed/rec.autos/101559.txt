HI
BEING
NEW
TO
A
CAR
OWNER
I
WOULD
PRETTY
MUCH
LIKE
TO
KNOW
MORE
ABOUT
SOME
BASICS
OF
MAINTAINING
THE
CARS
I
KNOW
THE
FOLLOWING
OIL
HAS
TO
BE
CHANGED
EVERY
MILES
CHANGE
THE
OIL
FILTER
TOO
CHECK
TIRES
BEFORE
GOING
ON
THE
HIGH
WAY
AND
FILL
UP
THE
TANK
MAKE
THAT
MONTHLY
OR
MORE
OFTEN
IF
YOU
KNOW
ONE
OR
MORE
OF
YOUR
TIRES
HAS
A
SLOW
LEAK
IF
THE
TIRE
HAS
A
LEAK
YOU
SHOULD
FIX
IT
WHAT
OTHERS
THANK
YOU
CHECK
ALL
FLUIDS
REGULARLY
EVERY
MONTH
CHECK
THE
OIL
EVERY

YOU
FILL
UP
WITH
GAS
DOESNT
WORK
TOO
WELL
IF
THE
ENGINE
IS
HOT
ITS
MORE
ACCURATE
TO
CHECK
THE
OIL
WHEN
THE
ENGINE
IS
COOL
IE
NOT
WHEN
YOU
ARE
AT
A
GAS
STATION
CRAIG
