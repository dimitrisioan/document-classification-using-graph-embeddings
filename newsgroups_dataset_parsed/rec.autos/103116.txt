re
saturn
manual
transmission
problem
in
article
writes
after
many
trips
to
the
dealer
who
has
admittedly
been
patient
with
me
they
are
admittedly
going
to
do
nothing
about
it
the
dealer
did
however
follow
the
bulletin
and
review
proper
shifing
procedures
with
the
owner
my
next
attempt
at
satisfaction
in
the
customer
number
but
from
the
first
round
it
doesnt
sound
too
hopeful
im
surprised
i
know
of
a
local
case
where
a
guy
took
his
saturn
back
five
times
to
complain
they
hadnt
properly
eliminated
a
rattling
noiseso
saturn
gave
him
a
new
car
call
that
number
