re
impala
ss
going
into
gm
has
always
screwed
the
rest
of
the
divisions
in
favor
of
the
corvette
the
current
platform
is
no
exception
the
detuned
camaro
and
firebird
is
a
load
of
crap
to
keep
people
from
realizing
that
they
can
buy
one
of
these
instead
of
a
corvette
and
save
about
i
like
the
idea
of
an
impala
ss
but
if
they
really
wanted
to
impress
me
they
would
throw
in
a
big
phat
imagine
the
cops
in
their
taurus
police
package
and
litres
as
they
stare
at
your
taillights
