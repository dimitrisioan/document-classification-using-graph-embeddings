WRITES
I
LOOKED
INTO
GETTING
AC
INSTALLED
ON
MY
HONDA
CRX
SI
THE
UNIT
IS
PLUS
SHIPPING
INSTALLATION
IS
LIKE
HOURS
ON
TOP
OF
THAT
THIS
IS
A
HUNK
OF
CHANGE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
ANY
PLACE
THAT
DOES
AFTERMARKET
AC
INSTALLATION
NOT
WITH
A
HONDA
AC
UNIT
BUT
SOME
THIRD
PARTY
UNIT
I
CANNOT
SEEM
TO
FIND
ANYONE
WHO
CAN
PUT
A
THIRD
PARTY
AC
UNIT
IN
A
HONDA
I
AM
IN
NO
CAROLINA
SO
I
WOULD
PREFER
SOME
PLACE
NEARBY
BUT
ANY
REFERENCES
WOULD
BE
HANDY

COMMENTS
SORRY
I
CANT
HELP
YOU
WITH
YOUR
QUESTION
BUT
I
DO
HAVE
A
COMMENT
TO
MAKE
CONCERNING
AFTERMARKET
AC
UNITS
I
HAVE
A
FROSTKING
OR
FROSTTEMP
FORGET
WHICH
AFTERMARKET
UNIT
ON
MY
CAVALIER
AND
AM
QUITE
UNHAPPY
WITH
IT
THE
FAN
IS
NOISY
AND
DOESNT
PUT
OUT
MUCH
AIR
I
WILL
NEVER
HAVE
AN
AFTERMARKET
AC
INSTALLED
IN
ANY
OF
MY
VEHICLES
AGAIN
I
JUST
CANT
TRUST
THE
QUALITY
AND
PERFORMANCE
AFTER
THIS
EXPERIENCE
LES
LES
BARTEL
IM
GOING
TO
LIVE
FOREVER
LET
ME
ADD
MY
IN
I
HAD
A
AC
INSTALLED
BY
THE
FORD
GARAGE
AND
IT
DID
NOT
WORK
AS
WELL
AS
THE
AC
THAT
WAS
INSTALLED
BY
THE
FACTORY
IN
PICKUPS
IDENTICAL
TO
MINE
I
HAVE
TALKED
TO
OTHER
PEOPLE
THAT
HAVE
HAD
THE
SAME
RESULT
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
JUST
A
PROBLEM
WITH
FORD
OR
WHAT
