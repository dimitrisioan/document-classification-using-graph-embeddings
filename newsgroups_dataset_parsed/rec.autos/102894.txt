STORY
WAS
CHRIST
ANOTHER
DEALER
SERVICE
SCAM
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
THEIR
PROBLEM
I
WASNT
GIVING
THEM
ANY
MORE
MONEY
THE
FINANCE
GUY
THEN
BROUGHT
IN
THE
MANAGER
ON
DUTY
WHO
PROCEEDED
TO
GIVE
ME
A
HARD
TIME
I
REMINDED
HIM
THAT
I
WAS
THE
CUSTOMER
AND
I
DIDNT
THINK
I
SHOULD
BE
TREATED
LIKE
THAT
AND
THAT
IF
HE
DIDNT
BACK
OFF
HE
COULD
FORGET
THE
WHOLE
DEAL
HE
MADE
SOME
SMART
REMARK
SO
I
TOLD
HIM
WHERE
HE
COULD
STICK
IT
SNATCHED
BACK
MY
CHECK
AND
LEFT
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THEY
WERE
NOT
PLEASED
BY
THE
TURN
OF
EVENTS
THATS
NOTHING
WHEN
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
WENT
SHOPPING
FOR
A
SMALL
SEDAN
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
SHE
BROUGHT
ME
ALONG
AS
A
TOKEN
MALE
SO
THE
SALESPEOPLE
WOULDNT
GIVE
HER
THE
BIMBO
TREATMENT
HER
FIRST
CHOICE
WAS
A
MAZDA
AND
SECOND
CHOICE
WAS
A
NISSAN
SENTRA
WE
WENT
TO
A
MAZDA
DEALERSHIP
AND
DESCRIBED
WHAT
WE
WANTED
WE
STARTED
NEGOTIATING
ON
THE
PRICE
AND
THE
SALESDROID
KEPT
PLAYING
THE
LET
ME
RUN
THIS
PRICE
BY
THE
SALES
MANAGER
AFTER
PLAYING
THE
GOOD
SALESMAN
BAD
SALESMAN
GAME
WE
FINALLY
TOLD
HIM
THAT
IF
HE
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
NEGOTIATE
A
PRICE
PERHAPS
WE
SHOULD
BE
SPEAKING
DIRECTLY
TO
SOMEONE
WHO
DID
HE
BROUGHT
IN
THE
SALES
MANAGER
WHO
PROCEEDED
TO
DICK
US
AROUND
WITH
EVERY
TRICK
IN
THE
BOOK
READ
REMAR
SUTTONS
DONT
GET
TAKEN
EVERY
TIME
FOR
A
LIST
FINALLY
AFTER
PLAYING
A
FEW
MORE
ROUNDS
OF
YOULL
HAVE
TO
WORK
WITH
US
ON
THIS
PRICE
ALSO
KNOWN
AS
EACH
TIME
YOU
COME
UP
A
THOUSAND
DOLLARS
WELL
COME
DOWN
TEN
THE
SALESMANAGER
GAVE
A
SIGNAL
TO
HIS
TWO
SALES
CRONIES
STOOD
UP
AND
SAID
WELL
WE
CANT
COME
DOWN
ANY
MORE
SO
I
GUESS
WE
CANT
HELP
YOU
AND
THEY
TROUPED
OUT
OF
THE
ROOM
LEAVING
US
SITTING
IN
THE
SALESMANS
OFFICE
ALL
BY
OURSELVES
HMM
ID
READ
THAT
SLEAZY
SALESMEN
SOMETIMES
BUG
THEIR
OWN
OFFICES
SO
THEY
CAN
LEAVE
AND
LISTEN
IN
ON
COUPLES
DISCUSSING
THE
SALES
OFFER
AND
I
MENTIONED
THIS
ALOUD
TO
MY
FRIEND
WHILE
WE
WERE
SITTING
THERE
WONDERING
WHY
THEY
WOULD
LEAVE
US
IN
THE
OFFICE
INSTEAD
OF
SHOWING
US
TO
THE
DOOR
FOR
LACK
OF
ANYTHING
BETTER
TO
DO
I
PICKED
UP
THE
PHONE
ON
THE
DESK
AND
CALLED
ANOTHER
MAZDA
DEALERSHIP
ASKED
FOR
A
SALESMAN
AND
BEGAN
DISCUSSING
WHAT
KIND
OF
PRICE
THEY
WOULD
CONSIDER
A
FEW
SENTENCES
INTO
THE
CONVERSATION
MR
SALESMANAGER
BROKE
INTO
THE
LINE
AND
BEGAN
TELLING
ME
HOW
RUDE
HE
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
THAT
I
WOULD
CALL
ANOTHER
DEALERSHIP
FROM
HIS
PHONE
I
SAID
THAT
SINCE
HED
ANNOUNCED
THAT
OUR
BUSINESS
WAS
OVER
HE
SHOULDNT
CARE
AND
EVERY
TIME
I
TRIED
TO
TALK
TO
THE
OTHER
SALES
GUY
THE
SALES
MANAGER
WOULD
DROWN
OUT
OUR
VOICES
WITH
HIS
OWN
HOW
DID
HE
KNOW
THAT
I
WAS
USING
THE
PHONE
ANYWAY
FINALLY
I
HUNG
UP
AND
WE
HEADED
OUT
OF
THE
SHOWROOM
SALES
MANAGER
AND
CRONIES
COME
OUT
OF
A
LITTLE
UNMARKED
ROOM
AND
HE
BEGINS
TO
BERATE
US
AGAIN
WE
SAY
THAT
WE
WONT
BOTHER
HIM
ANYMORE
WERE
GOING
NEXT
DOOR
TO
THE
NISSAN
DEALERSHIP
THEN
COMES
THE
PART
I
WISH
I
COULD
HAVE
VIDEOTAPED
AS
WE
GO
OUT
THE
FRONT
DOOR
THE
SALES
MANAGER
SHOUTS
ACROSS
THE
ENTIRE
SHOWROOM
CUSTOMERS
AND
ALL
GO
AHEAD
YOU
DESERVE
TO
BUY
A
NISSAN
SO
MY
FRIEND
BOUGHT
A
SENTRA
JUST
SO
THE
GUILTY
WONT
GO
UNPUNISHED
ILL
MENTION
THAT
THE
SALES
MANAGERS
NAME
WAS
GARY
TUSONE
FROM
HIS
MANNER
HIS
REFUSAL
TO
COME
DOWN
TO
A
REASONABLE
PRICE
AND
HIS
ANGER
AT
THE
END
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
HE
HAD
BET
OUR
ORIGINAL
SALESMAN
WHO
WAS
A
YOUNG
NOVICE
THAT
HED
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
AT
LEAST
X
DOLLARS
OUT
OF
US
AND
HE
WAS
STEAMED
THAT
WE
WOULDNT
FALL
FOR
HIS
SLIMY
TRICKS
