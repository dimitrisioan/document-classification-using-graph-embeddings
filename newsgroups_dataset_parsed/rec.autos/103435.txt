if
you
want
to
annoy
geico
call
them
upgive
fake
namebut
real
car
specsget
a
quote
and
then
tell
them
they
are
more
expensive
than
your
current
state
farmallstate
insurance
they
will
still
send
you
quote
etc
then
you
can
tear
up
their
quote
and
stuff
it
in
the
prepaid
return
envelope
and
mail
it
back
to
them
actually
they
were
more
than
my
current
state
farm
rates
actually
ive
had
a
bad
habit
of
stuffing
a
whole
bunch
of
other
garbage
junk
mail
in
along
with
whatever
else
into
anybodys
prepaid
envelopes
until
they
almost
burst
i
believe
they
pay
postage
by
weight
heh
heh
heh
anyways
dont
tear
up
the
quotes
just
yeti
sometimes
use
their
quotes
or
other
insurance
quotations
as
leverage
to
haggle
for
a
lower
rate
elsewhere
usually
it
works
to
your
advantage
if
they
are
lower
