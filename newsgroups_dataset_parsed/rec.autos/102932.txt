TOO

JIMFCENTERLINECOM
JIM
FROST
WRITES
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
THINGS
TO
KEEP
IN
MIND
ABOUT
EUROPE
SINCE
YOU
BROUGHT
IT
UP
MY
AUTOBAHN
KNOWLEDGE
IS
ADMITTEDLY
SECONDHAND
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THE
FOLLOWING
TO
BE
TRUE
MY
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
DRIVING
IN
THE
US
IS
ALSO
SECONDHAND
BUT
I
THINK
I
CAN
CORRECT
YOUR
STATEMENTS
ABOUT
OUR
AUTOBAHN
DRIVERS
ARE
MUCH
BETTER
DISCIPLINED
IN
EUROPE
THAN
THEY
ARE
HERE
OH
YEAH
THAT
WOULD
BE
PARADISE
IN
FACT
YOU
CAN
FORGET
IT
FROM
ALL
IVE
HEARD
FROM
MY
US
RELATIVES
DRIVERS
ESP
HERE
IN
GERMANY
ARE
MUCH
MORE
AGG
RESSIVE
BUT
NOT
DISCIPLINED
ONE
OF
MY
RELATIVES
A
LA
RESIDENT
HIRED
A
CAR
AT
THE
NUERNBERG
AIRPORT
AND
WENT
ABOUT
MILES
TO
OUR
HOME
HE
SAID
THEN
THAT
HE
GREW
ABOUT
YEAR
OLDER
DURING
THIS
RIDE
AND
SWORE
HED
NEVER
DRIVE
A
CAR
IN
GERMANY
AGAIN
THIS
WAS
IN
AND
HE
KEPT
HIS
PROMISE
THE
SITUATION
NOW
IS
EVEN
WORSE
AS
EFFECT
OF
THE
INCREASED
VOLUME
OF
TRAFFIC
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
BETTER
DISCIPLINED
SHOULD
PERHAPS
BE
CONSIDERED
CAUTIOUS
DUE
TO
FEAR
WHEN
DRIVING
AROUND
HERE
YOU
ALWAYS
HAVE
TO
TAKE
INTO
CONSIDERATION
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
OTHER
DRIVERS
ABSOLUTELY
RELIES
ON
YOU
THEY
EXPECT
THAT
NOBODY
FAILS
OR
SLEEPS
MANY
OF
THEM
EXPLOIT
THIS
BY
DRIVING
AS
FAST
AS
THEIR
CAR
CAN
GO
OF
COURSE
ONLY
WHERE
THAT
IS
ALLOWED
YOU
MIGHT
THINK
DREAM
ON
SO
ANY
MISTAKE
YOU
MAKE
IS
A
VERY
HIGH
RISK
TO
YOUR
HEALTH
AND
IF
YOURE
EX
POSED
TO
SUCH
A
SITUATION
FROM
YOUR
VERY
FIRST
DAY
AS
A
DRIVER
YOU
LEARN
TO
HANDLE
IT
OR
YOU
LOSE
THATS
THE
WAY
I
AND
MOST
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
EXPERIENCE
OUR
TRAFFIC
SITUATION
WHETHER
YOU
THINK
THIS
IS
PLEASANT
OR
EFFICIENT
IS
UP
TO
YOU
I
THINK
WE
HANDLE
A
VERY
HIGH
VOLUME
OF
TRAFFIC
AND
THAT
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
WITH
MODEST
COMPARED
TO
THE
VOLUME
AND
DECREASING
RATES
OF
LETHAL
ACCIDENTS
OTOH
MORE
AND
MORE
PEOPLE
ESP
WOMEN
DISLIKE
DRIVING
BECAUSE
THEY
FEEL
OVERTAXED
AND
THREATENED
AND
EACH
ACCIDENT
IS
ONE
ACCIDENT
TOO
MUCH
THE
ROADS
COMPRISING
THE
AUTOBAHN
ARE
MUCH
BETTER
DESIGNED
THAN
THEY
ARE
HERE
AND
USUALLY
INCLUDE
ANIMAL
FENCES
THIS
MAKES
THEM
FAR
MORE
PREDICTABLE
THAN
MOST
US
HIGHWAYS
BETTER
DESIGNED
AND
MAINTAINED
MAY
BE
BUT
ANIMAL
FENCES
ARE
VERY
RARE
AUTO
BAHNEN
AND
MANY
OTHER
STREETS
HAVE
GUARDRAILS
I
HOPE
THATS
THE
RIGHT
WORD
A
PLANK
MADE
FROM
THICK
STEEL
SHEET
FIXED
ON
UPRIGHTS
ITS
ABOUT
FEET
HIGH
THOSE
GUARDRAILS
ARE
DESIGNED
FOR
KEEPING
VEHICLES
ON
THE
ROAD
SMALLER
ANIMALS
CAN
CRAWL
UNDER
THE
PLANK
BIGGER
ONES
CAN
EASILY
JUMP
OVER
IT
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
ESP
LARGER
ANIMALS
ARE
VERY
RARE
IN
GERMANY
THEY
TEND
ALSO
TO
BE
VERY
TIMID
ACCIDENTS
CAUSED
BY
ANIMALS
ARE
A
NEGLEGIBLE
DANGER
NOT
ALL
OF
EUROPE
IS
THE
AUTOBAHN
MOST
PLACES
IN
EUROPE
HAVE
SPEED
LIMITS
THAT
ARENT
OUTOFLINE
WITH
WHAT
WE
USED
TO
HAVE
IN
THE
US
IF
MY
FRIENDS
WERENT
LYING
TO
ME
THEYRE
TYPICALLY
NOT
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
YOURE
RIGHT
THERE
ARE
SPEED
LINITS
EVEN
ON
THE
MAJOR
PART
OF
THE
AUTOBAHN
BUT
THE
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
DRIVING
SEE
ABOVE
SEEMS
TO
BE
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
IN
GERMANY
IVE
BEEN
IN
FRANCE
SWITZERLAND
ITALY
AUSTRIA
SPAIN
BELGIUM
THE
NETHERLANDS
BESIDES
THAT
YOU
REALLY
CANT
RELY
ON
THE
RESIDENTS
ABIDING
THE
LOCAL
SPEED
LIMITS
IVE
GOT
QUITE
A
LOT
OF
PRACTISE
MILES
AND
IM
USED
TO
TRAVEL
AT
MPH
FYI
WITH
A
CAR
EVEN
SMALLER
THAN
A
RABBIT
BUT
I
CONSIDER
DRIVING
ON
THE
HIGHWAYS
ROUND
PARIS
OR
MILANO
REALLY
A
THRILL
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
YOU
WONT
FIND
A
LOT
OF
RABBIT
OWNERS
DOING
NEARLY
ON
THE
AUTOBAHN
BUT
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
SORRY
BUT
YOULL
FIND
QUITE
A
LOT
RABBITCLASSCAR
OR
EVEN
SMALLER
MINE
IS
A
PEUGEOT
OWNERS
GOING
THAT
FAST
SMALL
CARS
WITH
MUCH
HP
ARE
VERY
HIP
OVER
HERE
AND
MOST
PEOPLE
BUYING
SUCH
CARS
ARENT
AFRAID
TO
LET
THEM
RUN
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
NO
RESPECT
FOR
THEIR
OWN
LIVES
I
DISAGREE
THE
SIZE
OR
WEIGHT
OF
A
CAR
IS
RATHER
IRRELEVANT
CARS
WEIGH
LESS
THAN
KG
AND
THE
DRIVERS
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
SURVIVE
ACCIDENTS
AT
MPH
OR
HIGHER
OTOH
WHEN
CRASHING
AGAINST
A
SOLID
OBJECT
AT
MPH
IT
MAKES
NO
DIFFERENCE
WHETHER
YOU
SIT
IN
A
PORSCHE
A
MERCEDES
A
TANK
OR
ON
A
BICYCLE
YOURRE
DEAD
BYE
STEFAN
STEFAN
DALIBOR
AND
NOW
FOR
THE
NEXT
CASE
IN
KANGAROO
COURT
I
ACCUSE
YOU
OF
BEING
THE
REINCARNATION
OF
ADOLF
HITLER
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
MERE
DENIALS
WILL
BE
SUFFICIENT
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
SUBMIT
TO
EXAMINATIONS
BY
A
PARAPSYCHOLOGIST
