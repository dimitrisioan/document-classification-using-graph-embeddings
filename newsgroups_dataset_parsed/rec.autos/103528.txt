WRITES
I
HEARD
THE
DIESELS
ARE
CONSIDERED
CLEANERBURNING
THAN
GAS
ENGINES
BECAUSE
THE
EMIT
LESS
OF
CARBON
MONOXIDE
HYDROCARBONS
AND
OXIDES
OF
NITROGEN
CO
HC
NOX
BUT
THEY
CAN
PUT
OUT
A
LOT
OF
PARTICULATE
MATTER
I
HEARD
SOMETHING
ABOUT
LEGISLATION
BEING
DISCUSSED
TO
CLEAN
UP
DIESEL
EMISSIONS
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
IN
THE
WORKS
TO
INSTALL
SCRUBBERS
FOR
DIESELS
HOW
ABOUT
THE
FEASIBILITY
OF
INSTALLING
THEM
ON
TRUCKS
AND

WOULD
IT
BE
ANY
DIFFERENT
THAN
A
CATYLITIC
CONVERTER
ID
ASSUME
EASIER
SINCE
WERE
REMOVING

INSTEAD
OF
CONVERTING
GASSES
LETS
HEAR
PEOPLES
OPINIONS
VW

MERCEDES
HAVE
TINKERED
WITH
PARTICULATE
TRAPS
ALSO
VW
USES
A

ON
THEIR

ALTHOUGH
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
MECHANICS
OF
IT
MANY
DIESEL

AND
TRUCKS
IN
EUROPE
ARE
NOW
BEING
EQUIPPED
WITH
CATALYSTS
AND
TRAPS
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
CLEAN
UP
DIESEL

ITS
A
SHAME
GM

FURTHER
RESOURCE
DEVOTION
TO
RESEARCH
INTO
MAKING
THIS
