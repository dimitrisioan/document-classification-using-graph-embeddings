i
dont
think
that
a
transmission
fluid
change
will
solve
your
problem
unless
you
are
in
an
extremely
cold
climate
and
using
a
very
heavy
weight
fluid
follow
the
manufacturers
recommended
oil
weight
some
of
the
cars
i
have
had
all
standard
transmissions
or
speeds
recommend
changing
the
transmission
fluid
at
miles
under
normal
driving
conditions
ive
gone
without
changing
the
transmission
oil
and
had
to
replace
the
transmission
bearings
my
older
cars
used
weight
oil
whereas
my
honda
uses
motor
oil
or
maybe
weight
