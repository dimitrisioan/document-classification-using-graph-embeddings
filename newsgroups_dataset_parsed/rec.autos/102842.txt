VW
PASSAT
ADVICE
SOUGHT
I
AM
CURRENTLY
IN
THE
CAR
MARKET
AND
WOULD
LIKE
OPINIONS
ON
A
VW
PASSAT
GLX
HOW
DOES
IT
COMPARE
TO
A
TOYOTA
CAMRY
I
THOUGHT
THE
CAR
LOOKED
VERY
SOLID
STABLE
AND
EUROPEAN
ONLY
DISAPPOINTMENT
SO
FAR
IS
THAT
THAT
IT
DOESNT
OFFER
AN
AIRBAO
MY
NEXT
QUESTION
IS
WHY
ISNT
VW
OFFERING
AUTOMOBILES
WITH
AIRBAGS
SHOULD
I
PAY
THE
EXTRA
THREE
THOUSAND
FOR
A
BMW
IS
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
IS
SMALLER
AND
LESS
POWERFUL
THAN
THAN
THE
PASSAT
