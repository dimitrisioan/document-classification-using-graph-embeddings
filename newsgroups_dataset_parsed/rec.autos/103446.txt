as
a
matter
of
interest
does
anyone
know
why
autos
are
so
popular
in
the
us
while
here
in
europe
they
are
rare
just
wondering
many
cars
sold
here
in
finland
are
small
and
cheap
cars
at
least
when
compared
to
other
cars
note
that
we
have
over
car
tax
and
you
couldnt
expect
a
good
auto
mated
to
a
l
engine
most
of
the
bigger
cars
are
however
sold
with
autos
i
would
guess
the
high
price
of
gas
in
europe
compared
to
the
us
has
always
favoured
manuals
small
engines
with
autos
are
a
real
bore
but
why
not
turn
the
question
around
why
are
automatics
so
common
in
the
us
my
guess
is
that
when
they
tried
to
couple
manuals
to
the
torquerich
in
the
sixties
the
clutches
turned
out
as
real
killers
you
had
to
use
both
feet
to
depress
and
that
this
has
just
lived
on
and
also
an
automatic
with
a
engine
can
be
real
fun
