DRAG
COEFFICIENTS
IN

GARY
W
MAHAN
WRITES
COULD
SOMEONE
EXPLAIN
HOW
TO
MAKE
SENSE
OF
DRAG
COEFFICIENTS
IE
CD
MENTIONED
IN
MAGAZINES
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
LOWER
NUMBERS
SIGNIFY
BETTER
AERODYNAMICS
BUT
WHAT
DOES
THIS
MEAN
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
IS
THERE
A
WAY
TO
CALCULATE
NEW
TOP
SPEEDSASSUMING
THE
CAR
IS
NOT
REV
LIMITED
AT
TOP
SPEED
OR
MILEAGE
BENEFITS
IF
A
IDENTICAL
CAR
HAD
THE
CD
REDUCED
FROM
TO
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE
FORMULAS
OFF
HAND
AS
IT
HAS
BEEN
AWHILE
SINCE
I
TOOK
AERODYNAMICS
AND
HAVENT
USED
THE
STUFF
SINCE
THE
CD
IS
RELATED
TO
THE
DRAG
FORCE
WHICH
IS
WHAT
EFFECTS
TOP
SPEED
AND
FUEL
CONSUMPTION
WHEN
THE
DRAG
FORCE
ON
THE
CAR
OR
AIRCRAFT
IS
GREATER
THAN
WHAT
THE
VEHICLES
ENGINE
CAN
OVERCOME
IT
HAS
REACHED
ITS
TOP
SPEED
AUTOS
OF
COURSE
ALSO
HAVE
TO
OVERCOME
ROLLING
RESISTANCE
SINCE
DRAG
OPPOSES
THE
VEHICLES
MOTION
THE
ENGINE
MUST
MAKE
UP
FOR
THAT
BY
BURNING
MORE
FUEL
ANYWAY
SINCE
THE
GEOMETERY
OF
AN
AUTO
IS
RATHER
COMPLEX

FOR

THE

WHERE

YOU
CAN
SET

AT

AT
