ROY

THIGPEN
WRITES
LAST
NIGHT
I
HAD
A
DREAM
THAT
MY
DAD
BOUGHT
A
VIPER
I
TOOK
IT
OUT
FOR
A
TEST
DRIVE
WITHOUT
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
AND
HAD
TO
PUSH
IT
ALL
THE
WAY
HOME
JUST
TO
AVOID
A
TICKET
WIERD
DREAM
I
WONDER
WHAT
IT
MEANS
YOU
PROBABLY
SHOULD
TOLD
YOU
DAD
TO
BUY
THAT
CAR
THAN
YOUR
DREAM
MIGHT
COME
TRUE
