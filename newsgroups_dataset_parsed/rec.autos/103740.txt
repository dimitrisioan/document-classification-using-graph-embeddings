gkoccasionally
i
have
trouble
shifting
into
reverse
the
shifter
gkrefuses
to
enter
the
gate
and
i
often
grind
the
synchros
trying
to
gkget
it
into
gear
ill
be
watching
this
carefully
in
the
next
couple
gkof
months
enter
wait
seconds
and
then
go
into
reverse
they
use
the
same
synchros
and
youll
never
at
least
i
havent
groundemtofit
when
using
this
technique
or
do
like
the
manual
says
and
put
it
in
first
then
you
can
quickly
go
into
reverse
no
waiting
one
more
way
which
works
in
manual
trans
cars
ive
driven
and
it
is
my
personal
favorite
the
other
suggestions
above
are
great
but
try
this
one
too
while
pushing
the
shifter
gently
towards
reverse
let
the
clutch
out
slowly
right
to
the
friction
point
and
the
shifter
will
be
pulled
into
position
if
you
do
it
right
the
car
wont
jump
backward
nor
will
the
gears
grind
you
will
just
glide
back
