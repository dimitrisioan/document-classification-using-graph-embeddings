ANY
RACE
ON
A

A
YUGO
THAT
WILL
GO
IN
SECONDS
WILL
NOT
LOSE
ON
THE
STREET
THATS
JUST
TOO
DAMN
QUICK
IT
MIGHT
BE
WRAPPED
AROUND
A
TELEPHONE
POLE
AT
THE
END
OF
THAT
QUARTER
MILE
BUT
IT
WILL
BE
THERE
ALONE
HAVE
YOU

OR
ANY
NUMBER
OF

YOU
CAN
BUILD
A
MUSTANG
OR
CAMARO
WHICH
IS
SUPERIOR
TO
EITHER

FOR
LESS
THAN
THE
STICKER
PRICE
OF
EITHER

THE
TORSEN
DIFFERENTIAL
OF

THE
DIFFERENTIAL
OF

DOESNT
BREAK
IT
TRANSMITS

S
WELL
THE

USES
THE

WHY
IT
HAS
THE
ECONOBOX
RUNNING
GEAR
THAT
WAS
ALSO
FACTORED
INTO
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
MUSTANG
FROM
THE
DAY
LEE

DESIGNED
AS
A
WIDEMARKET
CARSPORTY

DESIGNED
FOR
A
SPECIFIC
