JAMES
P
CALLISON
WRITES
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
ARGUE
THE
ISSUE
OF
CARRYING
WEAPONS
BUT
I
WOULD
ASK
YOU
IF
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
SERIOUSLY
ABOUT
SHOOTING
A
KID
FOR
SETTING
OFF
YOUR
ALARM
I
CAN
THINK
OF
WORSE
THINGS
IN
THE
WORLD
GLAD
YOU
GOT
OUT
OF
THERE
BEFORE
THEY
DID
ANYTHING
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
REASON
TO
FIRE
YOUR
GUN
I
THINK
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
KILL
TO
DEFEND
THEIR
PROPERTY
WHY
NOT
BE
HONEST
DO
YOU
REALLY
CARE
MORE
ABOUT
SCUM
THAN
ABOUT
YOUR
CAR
I
CANT
TELL
IF
MATT
IS
BEING
SARCASTIC
HERE
OR
NOT
BUT
TO
BE
HONEST
MANY
AUTOMOBILES
ARE
WORTH
FAR
MORE
TO
THEIR
OWNERS
IN
VALUE
AND
INVESTMENT
THAN
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WOULD
TAKE
THEM
I
DONT
HAVE
FIGURES
ON
AVERAGE
PROPERTY
TAX
IN
THE
US
OR
HOW
MUCH
OF
IT
IS
ALLOCATED
FOR
HOUSING
PROJECTS
INFERIOR
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
JAILS
OR
THE
LIKE
BUT
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THAT
THE
AMOUNT
THE
GOVERNMENT
STEALS
FROM
AN
HONEST
PRODUCTIVE
CITIZEN
TO
BREED
THIS
TRASH
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS
THAN
THE
VALUE
OF
MANY
AUTOMOBILES
AND
FOR
THOSE
WHO
WILL
ARGUE
THAT
THE
ANIMALS
OUT
THERE
STEALING
CARS
AND
EVERYTHING
ELSE
NOT
TO
MENTION
COMMITTING
COMPLETELY
SENSELESS
ACTS
OF
VIOLENCE
SUCH
AS
RAPE
CANNOT
BE
VALUED
IN
TERMS
OF
MONEY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
HUMAN
BEINGS
I
SUBMIT
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
HUMAN
BEINGS
JIM
CALLISON
I
THINK
IS
ON
THE
RIGHT
TRACK
AND
CHINTAN
AMIN
REMARKED
EARLIER
THAT
WE
CANNOT
BLAME
ENVIRONMENT
FOR
THE
ACTIONS
OF
A
SINGLE
CRIMINAL
I
COULDNT
AGREE
MORE
ONE
COULD
TRACE
ANY
CRIME
BACK
TO
THE
ENVIRONMENTUPBRINGING
OF
THE
CRIMINAL
SHOULD
WE
LET
ALL
OF
THEM
OUT
FROM
PICKPOCKETS
TO
RAPISTS
TO
INSIDE
TRADERS
BECAUSE
WHAT
THEY
DID
WASNT
THEIR
FAULT
WHERE
DOES
ONE
DRAW
THE
LINE
