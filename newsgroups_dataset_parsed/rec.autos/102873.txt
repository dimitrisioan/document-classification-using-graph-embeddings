DRIVING
IN
A
STRAIGHT
LINE
IS
FINE
YOU
VERY
SOON
BECOME
ACLIMATED
TO
IT
ITS
ONLY
A
RUSH
WHEN
THERE
ARE
CORNERS
THAT
YOU
DONT
THINK
YOU
CAN
MAKE
ON
A
CLEAR
AUTOBAHN
IS
NOTHING
IN
THE
US
OF
PEOPLE
AND
ALL
JUDGES
WOULD
LABEL
YOU
INSANE
AND
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
PERSUADE
PEOPLE
OTHERWISE
SURE
BUT
THE
SURFACE
CONDITION
OF
MOST
GOOD
AUTOBAHNS
IS
FAR
BETTER
THE
QUALITY
OF
AUTOBAHNS
IS
SOMETHING
OF
A
MYTH
THE
ROAD
SURFACE
ISNT
MUCH
DIFFERENT
TO
A
TYPICAL
TX
FREEWAY
THEY
ARE
BETTER
IN
TERMS
OF
LIGHTING
SAFETY
SIGNS
ROADMARKINGS
ETC
ID
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
DRIVING
ON
MOST
US
FREEWAYS
AS
IT
IS
I
SAVE
IT
FOR
THE
BACKROADS
WHICH
REALLY
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
DANGEROUS
THAN
MOST
OF
THE
ROADS
HERE
A
DIP
IN
THE
ASPHALT
THAT
YOU
TEST
YOUR
SHOCKS
ON
AT
WILL
KILL
YOU
AT
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
LOVE
TO
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
QUITE
SEVERE
I
DONT
RECALL
ANY
US
FREEWAY
WITHOUT
ROAD
DAMAGE
WARNINGS
THAT
I
WOULD
REGARD
AS
UNSAFE
AT
IN
ANY
DECENT
WELL
DAMPED
CAR
NOTE
THAT
MY
DEFINITION
OF
DECENT
WELL
DAMPED
WOULD
EXCLUDE
MOST
TYPICAL
AMERICAN
SEDANS
DRIVE
QUICKLY
AND
THEY
SAY
MY
PROBE
WILL
DO
BUT
THATS
MORE
THAN
IVE
EVER
TRIED
IN
IT
CAUSE
THERE
ISNT
A
DECENT
ENOUGH
PIECE
OF
ROAD
HEREABOUTS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
YOU
LIVE
BUT
I
WOULD
BE
MUCH
MORE
WORRIED
ABOUT
COPS
OTHER
TRAFFIC
ETC
THAN
THE
ROAD
SURFACE
AT
IT
JUST
ISNT
THAT
FAST
OR
THAT
DANGEROUS
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
PROBE
GT
NO
PROBLEM
THE
MODELS
I
HAVE
DRIVEN
WOULD
BE
LIKELY
TO
BE
UNPREDICTABLE
