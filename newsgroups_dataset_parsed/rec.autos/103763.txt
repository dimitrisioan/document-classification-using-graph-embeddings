UCH
CHEAPER
AND
JUST

I
TEND
TO
AGREE
THO
THAT
THIS
STILL
DOESNT
TAKE
THE
SHO
UP
TO
STANDARD
FOR
RUNNING
ON
A

THE

SHOULD

JAMES
I
REALLY
HATE
TO
DO
THIS

TRY
READING
THE
DAMN
POSTS
NEVER
WAS
A
TBIRD
MENTIONED
THE
DISCUSSION
WAS
ABOUT
SHOS
AND
STANGS
NOT
BEING
UP
TO
SPEC
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
ABOUT
TBIRDS
I
ONLY
KNOW
THAT
THE
SPECS
QUOTED
FOR
THE
SHO
BY
PREVIOUS
POSTER
SOUNDED
A
LITTLE
ANEMIC
FOR
ME
TO
SAY
THAT
IT
WAS
UP
TO
SNUFF
THIS
DOES
NOT
IN
ANY
WAY
DISENCOURAGE
ME
FROM
WISHING
TO
OWN
ONE
NOR
DOES
IT
MAKE
IT
A
BAD
CAR
IT
MERELY
MEANS
THAT
I
THINK
FORD
COULD
HAVE
ADDED
THAT
EXTRA
BIT
OF
SAFETY
AND
TOSSED
IN
LARGER
BRAKES
AS
THE
WHEELS
ARE
PLENTY
LARGE
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
TO
FIT
IF
MEMORY
SERVES
RIGHT
WHICH
IT
MAY
VERY

THE

PLENTY
