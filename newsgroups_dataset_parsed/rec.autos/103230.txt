i
just
ordered
a
saturn
after
considering
a
few
imports
frankly
the
saturn
stuff
deleted
saturn
also
has
a
good
extended
warranty
program
for
miles
fully
refunded
if
you
dont
use
it
that
works
out
to
an
actual
cost
of
or
so
based
on
the
year
treasury
rates
using
savings
account
rates
its
more
like
in
the
first
three
years
it
also
buys
you
free
rental
during
any
warranty
work
without
counting
against
the
refund
mike
in
general
extended
warranties
are
a
ripoff
this
is
really
only
because
you
get
the
one
free
with
the
car
also
is
there
perhaps
a
deductible
you
pay
each
and
every
time
you
use
the
warranty
also
are
certain
items
excluded
from
coverage
on
the
extended
warranty
and
if
you
use
it
at
year
for
some
buck
job
and
pay
a
deduct
and
then
you
have
used
it
so
no
refund
ever
again
extended
warranties
are
ripoff
high
profit
items
for
the
dealer
