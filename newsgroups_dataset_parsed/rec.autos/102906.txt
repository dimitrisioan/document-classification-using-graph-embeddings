RE
CAR
BUYING
STORY
WAS
CHRIST
ANOTHER
DEALER
SERVICE
SCAM
WHILE
NOT
EXACTLY
A
SERVICE
INCIDENT
I
HAD
A
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCE
RECENTLY
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
A
NEW
TRUCK
I
HAD
PICKED
OUT
THE
VEHICLE
I
WANTED
AND
AFTER
A
LITTLE
HAGGLING
WE
AGREED
ON
A
PRICE
I
WROTE
THEM
A
CHECK
FOR
THE
DOWN
PAYMENT
PLUS
TAX
AND
LICENSE
AND
TOLD
THEM
ID
BE
BACK
THAT
EVENING
TO
PICK
UP
THE
TRUCK
WHEN
I
RETURNED
I
HAD
TO
WAIT
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
BEFORE
THE
FINANCE
GUY
COULD
GET
TO
ME
WHEN
I
FINALLY
GOT
IN
THERE
EVERYTHING
WENT
SMOOTHLY
UNTIL
HE
STARTED
ADDING
UP
THE
NUMBERS
HE
THEN
DISCOVERED
THAT
THEY
HAD
MISCALCULATED
THE
TAX
LICENSE
BY
ABOUT
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
POPULAR
SCAM
WITH
DEALERS
LAST
MONTH
MY
BROTHER
BOUGHT
A
NEW
AUDI
SERIES
QUATRO
FROM
A
LOCAL
DEALER
THEY
CAME
BACK
WITH
THE
FINAL
PRICE
TAX
AND
ALL
AND
HE
ADDED
IT
UP
FOR
HIMSELF
THERE
HAPPENED
TO
BE
AN
EXTRA
TAGGED
ON
UNDER
THE
TAX
PART
HE
POINTED
OUT
THEIR
ERROR
AND
ASKED
THEM
TO
RETHINK
THEIR
ADDITION
THEY
CAME
BACK
WITH
THE
RIGHT
PRICE
THE
NEXT
TIME
