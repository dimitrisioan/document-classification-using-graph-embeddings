my
wife
has
informed
me
that
she
wants
a
convertible
for
her
next
car
i
was
about
to
recommend
you
consider
a
targa
top
over
a
convertible
but
drew
made
the
point
very
well
when
my
wife
and
i
were
in
our
we
did
the
convertible
thing
with
triumphs
now
in
our
we
still
appreciate
the
open
air
but
prefer
targa
types
there
is
much
less
wind
noise
objectspapers
blowing
around
foreign
objects
getting
into
the
car
and
one
still
has
almost
all
the
advantages
of
the
convertible
my
last
car
had

my
current
car
is
a
convertible
imho
if
youre
after
that
convertible

whatever
just
dont

theres
no
substitute
for
a
convertible
if
youre
not
after
that
sun
beating
down
on
you
the
wind
in
your
hair
and
teeth
the
flopsum
and
jetsum
getting
in
the
car
and
the
noises
associated
with
the
whooshing
of
the
wind
youre
not
after
that
convertible
feel
so
go
with
something
with
at
least
a
hole
above
the
driver
but
dont
call
it
a
convertible
and
i
do
wonder
how
those
targa
tops
would
compare
against
my
roll
bar
in
a
rollover
situation
of
course
id
rather
not
test
it
in
my
car
i
too
am
