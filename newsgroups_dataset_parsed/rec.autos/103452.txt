RE
SERVICE
INDICATOR
OF
A
BMW
DEREK
THERE
IS
A
TOOL
AVAILABLE
TO
RESET
THE
SERVICE
INDICATOR
ON
BMWS
BUT
THE
LIGHTS
WILL
COME
BACK
ON
AFTER
WEEKS
THE
TOOL
IS
IN
FACT
ILLEGAL
IN
EUROPE
ATLEAST
IT
IS
OFTEN
THE
CASE
THAT
THE
UNSUSPECTING
PUNTER
TROTS
OFF
TO
BUY
A
USED
BMW
AND
A
FEW
WEEKS
LATER
ALL
THE
LIGHTS
COME
ON
OTHER
THAN
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
NO
OTHER
TOOL
ANYONE
ELSE
ABOUT
CHANGING
OIL
EVERY
MILES
THATS
OK
ON
NEWER
AUDIS
THEY
ONLY
REQUIRE
IT
AFTER
EVERY
MILES
I
AM
TALKING
ABOUT
AN
OIL
CHANGE
JUST
A
QUERY
DO
YOU
DRIVE
YOUR
CAR
VERY
VERY
CAREFULLY
LIKE
NO
SUDDEN
ACCELERATION
ETC
IF
YEAH
THEN
THE
M
OIL
CHANGE
SEEMS
QUITE
REASONABLE
BUT
IF
YOU
DRIVE
KINDA
FAST
ID
GET
A
BIT
UP
TIGHT
ABOT
THAT
THINGY
A
POINT
TO
NOTE
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
FIRST
LIGHT
CAME
ON
AT
DOESNT
MEAN
ALL
THE
OTHERS
WILL
COME
ON
EVERY
TOO
SHAZ
