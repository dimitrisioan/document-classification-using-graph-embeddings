WRITES
WATER
GRADUALLY
BUILDS
UP
IN
THE
TRUNK
OF
MY
FRIENDS
FORD
PROBE
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
SPARE
AND
SCOOP
OUT
THE
WATER
UNDER
THE
PLYWOODCARPET
COVER
ON
THE
TRUNK
I
WOULD
GUESS
THIS
USUALLY
HAPPENS
AFTER
A
GOOD
THUNDER
STORM
A
FEW
QS
IS
THIS
A
COMMON
PROBLEM
WHERE
ARE
THE
DRAIN
HOLES
LOCATED
FOR
THE
HATCH
I
NOTICED
THIS
IS
MY
PROBE
ALSO
WHEN
RECENTLY
CLEANING
OUT
THE
BACK
I
THINK
THE
WATER
IS
COMING
UP
THROUGH
SOME
RUBBER
STOPPERED
HOLES
BENEATH
THE
SPARE
MINE
LOOKED
SLIGHTLY
WORN
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
WATER
OR
WATER
DAMAGE
ABOVE
THE
LEVEL
OF
THE
SPARE
AREA
THIS
HAS
TAKEN
A
LOW
PRIORITY
SINCE
I
JUST
FOUND
OUT
WHILE
ROTATING
MY
TIRES
THAT
I
HAVE
A
TORN
CV
BOOT
UGH
IVE
GOT
AN
GT
IT
HAS
THE
SMOKED
TAILLIGHT
ASSEMBLY
I
THINK
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
WATER
IS
GETTING
IN
WHEN
I
FIRST
GOT
IT
HAD
IT
FOR
A
MONTH
ONE
OF
THE
REAR
TAILLIGHTS
FOGGED
UP
WITH
MOISTURE
I
TOOK
IT
IN
TO
THE
DEALER
AND
THEY
REPLACED
THE
ENTIRE
ASSEMBLY
IT
HAPPENED
TO
THE
OTHER
ONE
ABOUT
MONTHS
LATER
THIS
TIME
I
HAPPENED
TO
LOOK
IN
THE
SPARE
TIRE
WELL
AND
NOTICED
WATER
STANDING
IN
THERE
THE
DEALER
WAS
MORE
RELUCTANT
THIS
TIME
TO
REPLACE
IT
BUT
I
CONVINCED
THEM
TO
FIX
IT
THEY
MUST
HAVE
HAD
TO
DEAL
WITH
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
PROBES
WITH
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
I
HAVENT
NOTICED
WATER
IN
THE
TAILLAMPS
OR
THE
TRUNK
FOR
THE
LAST
YEARS
BUT
JUST
LAST
MONTH
THE
TAILLAMP
JUST
FOGGED
UP
AGAIN
IM
GOING
TO
TRY
TO
TAKE
IT
BACK
TO
GET
THEM
TO
FIX
IT
AGAIN
IM
REAL
TEMPTED
TO
DRILL
SOME
VENT
AND
DRAIN
HOLES
IN
THE
TOPS
AND
BOTTOMS
OF
THE
ASSEMBLY
AND
FORGET
ABOUT
IT
THIS
IS
GETTING
VERY
ANNOYING
ALMOST
EVERY
OTHER
GT
IVE
SEEN
HAS
HAD
THIS
PROBLEM
