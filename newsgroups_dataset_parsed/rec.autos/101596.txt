kyto
all
those
who
have
passats
do
you
recommend
using
super
unleaded
or
just
kyregular
unleaded
gasoline
i
have
been
using
regular
unleaded
a
friend
of
mine
has
kya
jetta
and
has
always
used
super
unleaded
and
thinks
i
should
be
using
the
same
kyhowever
i
believe
the
advantages
of
super
unleaded
for
cars
and
under
kyhas
been
overplayed
by
guess
who
the
companies
who
sell
them
because
that
is
kywhere
they
make
the
most
profit
a
ralph
nader
report
and
other
consumer
advocates
kyhave
in
the
past
spoken
against
those
oil
companies
your
passat
is
designed
to
run
on
premium
gasoline
however
the
engine
electronics
will
retard
the
timing
so
that
no
harm
wil
be
done
to
the
engine
with
lower
octane
fuel
you
will
likely
however
get
somewhat
more
power
and
fuel
mileage
especially
in
hot
weather
out
of
this
particular
engine
if
you
do
run
it
on
premium
