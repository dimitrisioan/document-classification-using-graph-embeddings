DONT
BUY
ONE
THAT
IS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
AVOID
TICKETS
I
USED
TO
HAVE
ONE
AND
WHENEVER
A
COP
WOULD
PULL
ME
OVER
SEE
THE
THING
GIVE
ME
A
TICKET
ONE
TIME
MY
SISTER
WAS
DRIVING
AND
HAD
IT
IN
THE
GLOVE
COMPARTMENT
IT
WAS
BROKEN
AND
SHE
GOT
A
TICKET
IN
I
HAD
RECEIVED
TICKETS
BECAUSE
OF
IT
ONE
FOR
MY
SISTER
SO
A
TOTAL
OF
FIVE
THAT
WAS
FIVE
YEARS
AGO
NOW
I
DONT
HAVE
ONE
AND
HAVE
NOT
GOTTEN
A
TICKET
MY
DRIVING
HABITS
HAVE
NOT
CHANGED
DRASTICALLY
ONLY
TWO
DAYS
AGO
I
WAS
GOING
MPH
ON
HIGHWAY
WITH
MPH
LIMIT
COP
SAW
ME
I
BREAK
A
LITTLE
NOTHING
HAPPENED
I
WAS
DRIVING
A
MINIVAN
WITH
MY
FAMILY
IN
IT
OTHERWISE
I
HAVE
CUTLASS
SUPREME
WHICH
I
DO
MOST
OF
THE
TIMES
ON
THE
HIGHWAY
SO
BASICALLY
MY
OPNION
IS
NOT
TO
GET
ONE
IF
YOU
DO
GET
PULLED
OVER
THE
COP
WILL
HEAR
YOUR
EXCUSE
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
RADAR
DETECTER
HE
WILL
NOT
AGAIN
THIS
HAS
BEEN
MY
EXPERIENC
JUST
GET
A
REMOTE
MODEL
THAT
IS
NOT
VISIBLE
TO
THE
COP
BUT
BE
SURE
TO
GET
FRONT
AND
REAR
SENSORS
YOU
CAN
ALSO
JUST
PUT
THE
DETECTOR
OFF
TO
THE
SIDE
ON
THE
DASH
SO
THE
COP
DOESNT
SEE
IT
RIGHT
AWAYVALENTINE
IS
THE
BEST
DETECTOR
BY
FAR
AS
STATED
BY
CAR
AND
DRIVER
AND
EVEN
TELLS
YOU
WHAT
DIRECTION
THE
RADAR
IS
COMING
FROM
IT
ALSO
GIVES
THE
AMOUNT
OF
THREATS
IT
IS
PICKING
UP
SO
IF
YOU
GO
THROUGH
THE
SAME
PLACE
EVERYDAY
AND
IT
ALWAYS
GOES
OFF
THERE
YOU
CAN
GLANCE
AT
THE
NUMBER
OF
THREATS
THE
VALENTINE
IS
DETECTING
TO
SEE
IF
IT
IS
A
GENUINE
COP
ITS
ABOUT
AND
YOU
CAN
ONLY
GET
IT
