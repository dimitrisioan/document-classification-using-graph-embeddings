RE
AD
SAID
NISSAN
ALTIMA
BEST
SELLER
I
TOO
WAS
PUZZLED
BY
THIS
OBVIOUS
UNTRUTH
WHAT
I
THINK
IS
GOING
ON
IS
THAT
NISSAN
CLAIMS
THAT
THE
ALTIMA
IS
THE
BEST
SELLING
NEW
CAR
NAMELPLATE
IN
THE
US
I
THINK
I
HAVE
THIS
NEAR
VERBATIM
LEE
IACCOCAS
STATISTICS
DEPT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PROUD
OF
THAT
SENTENCE
NOTE
THAT
THE
COROLLAPRISM
ARE
ALSO
NEW
DESIGNS
BUT
HEY
ARE
NOT
NEW
NAMEPLATES
I
GUESS
NISSAN
DOESNT
EVEN
SELL
AS
MANY
ALTIMAS
AS
TOYOTA
DOES
COROLLAS
OR
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
NAMEPLATE
QUALIFIER
