ford
explorer
question
and
suv
review
ok
so
in
my
ongoing
search
for
a
sport
utility
heres
the
latest
toyota
small
small
small
small
the
interior
of
this
vehical
is
impossible
for
a
large
person
too
bad
it
would
have
been
the
winner
otherwise
nissan
pathfinder
very
low
ceiling
my
head
hit
the
roof
fun
on
bumps
no
also
has
a
cheaplooking
interior
isuzu
trooper
class
act
this
is
a
really
really
nice
vehical
very
comfortable
handled
ok
has
really
cool
grab
handles
everywhere
but
its
huge
and
the
engine
is
a
bit
too
small
for
its
bulk
also
the
manual
shift
is
weird
and
kind
of
awkward
id
buy
this
if
it
were
cheaper
or
shorter
but
at
this
size
and
for
this
price
no
i
kept
picturing
trying
to
park
in
in
san
francisco
no
thanks
chevy
blazer
cheap
looking
small
not
as
small
as
the
toyota
and
nissan
but
still
too
small
ford
explorer
this
is
no
sports
car
and
its
certainly
not
for
the
serious
off
roader
but
its
big
enough
to
be
comfortable
without
being
as
huge
and
heavy
as
the
trooper
its
engine
has
plenty
of
power
for
everyday
driving
though
it
would
be
nice
if
it
had
a
bit
more
the
automatic
tranny
is
pretty
nice
head
and
shoulders
above
my
mazda
mpv
the
steering
is
not
as
tight
as
id
like
but
its
acceptable
the
two
door
has
easytoenter
back
seats
easier
to
get
into
in
fact
than
the
drivers
seat
of
the
and
with
a
shorter
wheelbase
and
the
easier
availability
of
a
manual
tranny
yes
im
a
manual
shift
biggot
i
admit
it
its
the
one
im
thinking
of
buying
so
that
said
is
there
anyone
out
there
who
has
one
of
these
and
hates
it
anyone
had
any
major
problems
heard
any
horror
stories
also
any
reason
to
buy
the
ford
over
the
mazda
navajo
both
being
essentially
the
same
vehical
thanks
