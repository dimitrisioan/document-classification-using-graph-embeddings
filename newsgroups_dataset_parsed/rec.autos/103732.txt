SMALL
SMALL
SMALL
THE
INTERIOR
OF
THIS
VEHICAL
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
A
LARGE

IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
WINNER
OTHERWISE

A
REALLY
REALLY
NICE
VEHICAL
VERY
COMFORTABLE
HANDLED
OK
HAS
REALLY
COOL
GRAB
HANDLES
EVERYWHERE
BUT
ITS
HUGE
AND
THE
ENGINE
IS
A
BIT
TOO
SMALL
FOR
ITS
BULK
ALSO
THE
MANUAL
SHIFT
IS
WEIRD
AND
KIND
OF
AWKWARD

TOO
SMALL
FORD
EXPLORER
THIS
IS
NO
SPORTS
CAR
AND
ITS
CERTAINLY
NOT
FOR
THE
SERIOUS
OFF
ROADER
BUT
ITS
BIG
ENOUGH
TO
BE
COMFORTABLE
WITHOUT
BEING
AS
HUGE
AND
HEAVY
AS
THE
TROOPER
ITS
ENGINE
HAS
PLENTY
OF
POWER
FOR
EVERYDAY
DRIVING

IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
IT
HAD
A
BIT
MORE
THE
AUTOMATIC

PRETTY
NICE
HEAD
AND
SHOULDERS

MY
MAZDA

THE
STEERING

NOT
AS
TIGHT
AS

LIKE
BUT
ITS
ACCEPTABLE
THE
TWO
DOOR
HAS
EASYTOENTER

SEATS
EASIER
TO
GET
INTO
IN
FACT
THAN
THE
DRIVERS
SEAT
