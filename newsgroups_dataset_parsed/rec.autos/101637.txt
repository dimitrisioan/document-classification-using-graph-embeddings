WRITES
ANY
REASON
YOU
ARE
LIMITED
TO
THE
TWO
MENTIONED
THEY
ARENT
REALLY
AT
THE
SAME
POINT
ALONG
THE
SUV
SPECTRUM
NOT
TO
MENTION
PRICE
RANGE
HOW
ABOUT
THE
EXPLORER
TROOPER
BLAZER
MONTERO
AND
IF
THE
BUDGET
ALLOWS
THE
LAND
CRUISER
ANY
ADVICE
ON
HOW
TO
BUY
A
LAND
CRUISER
MY
LOCAL
TOYOTA
DEALER
SAYS
THEY
GET
TWO
A
YEAR
AND
IF
I
WANT
ONE
I
CAN
JUST
GET
ON
THE
WAITING
LIST
FORGET
ABOUT
A
TEST
DRIVE
OR
EVEN
KICKING
THE
TIRES
AND
IF
THEY
ARE
THAT
RARE
I
DOUBT
THERE
IS
MUCH
OF
A
PARTS
INVENTORY
ON
HAND
LAND
CRUSIER
IS
JUST
SIMPLY
NICE
WITH
SHITLOAD
OF
POWER
AND
ROOM
FULLY
STOCKED
IT
COST
I
THINK
IT
IS
WORTH
THE
MONEY
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS
WHEN
YOU
GET
INTO
ACCIDENTIT
DOESNT
USUALLY
BREAK
DOWN
UNLESS
YOU
FORGET
TO
GET
A
OIL
CHANGE
FOR
MILES
OR
SOMETHING
STUPID
LIKE
THIS
BODY
PARTS
AND
OTHER
PARTS
ARE
VERY
HARD
TO
LOCATE
PARTS
ARE
OVER
PRICED
ALSO
ONE
OF
MY
FRIEND
HAD
ACCIDENT
IN
PAST
SNOW
STORM
AND
HE
IS
STILL
WAITING
FOR
FRONT
BUMPER
AND
PASSENGER
SIDE
FENDER
WELL
IF
YOU
TEST
DRIVE
LAND
CRUISER
ALL
OTHER

LOOK
LIKE
TOYS
ONE
OF
MAGAZINE
