RE
RFI
ART
OF
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTING
I
USED
TO
DRIVE
A
TRUCK
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
I
ONCE
RODE
WITH
AN
OLD
CODGER
THAT
HAD
BEEN
DRIVING
FOR
ABOUT
YRS
THE
ONLY
TIME
HE
WOULD
USE
THE
CLUTCH
WAS
TO
GET
THE
TRUCK
MOVING
HE
COULD
SHIFT
THAT
SPEED
LIGHTNING
QUICK
UP
OR
DOWN
WITHOUT
THE
SLIGHTEST
RAKE
OF
A
GEAR
HE
WAS
AS
SMOOTH
AS
SILK
IT
WAS
THE
MOST
AMAZING
SHIFTING
DEMONSTRATION
IVE
EVER
SEEN
HAVING
SAID
ALL
THAT
I
STILL
DONT
KNOW
WHY
ANYONE
WOULD
WANT
TO
SHIFT
A
SYNCHRONIZED
TRANNY
WITHOUT
A
CLUTCH
WHY
DO
IT
