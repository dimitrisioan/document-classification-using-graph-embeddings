WRITES
MY
TECHNIQUE
IS
TO
EASE
BACK
OFF
THE
THROTTLE
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
GENTLY
WRIST
BACK
ON
THE
SHIFT
LEVER
IF
FOR
SOME
REASON
I
MISS
THE
SHIFT

LIGHTLY
PRESS
THE
ACCELERATOR
TRY
AGIAN

THAT
CLUTCHLESS
SHIFTING
IS
EAISERQUICKER
AT
HIGH
RPMS
I
ALSO
SKIP
GEARS
SOME
TIMES
USING
SOUNDS
ABOUT
RIGHT
I
USUALLY
SLIP
IT
OUT
DURING
THROTTLEDOWN
AND
THEN
BLIP
THE
THROTTLE
AND
WAIT
UNTIL
IT
FEELS
LIKE
THINGS
ARE
RIGHT

SLIP
IT
INTO

SOME
PEOPLE

NEVER
GET
IT
AND
OTHERS
LIKE
ME
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
THE
GUTS
TO
TRY
IT

PLANNING
