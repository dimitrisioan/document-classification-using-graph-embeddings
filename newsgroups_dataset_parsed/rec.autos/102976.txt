DEAR
NETTERS
I
AM
LOOKING
TO
BUY
A
USED
EAGLE
TALON
OR
TSI
AWD
I
WOULD
BE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
HOW
THE
CAR
WAS
DRIVEN
AND
HOW
WELL
IT
WAS
MAINTAINED
I
OWN
A
TURBOCHARGED
ONE
AND
I
WOULD
NEVER
BUY
A
TURBOCHARGED
VEHICLE
UNLESS
I
KNEW
THE
OWNER
AND
HISHER
DRIVINGMAINTENANCE
HABITS
QUESTION
IS
THAT
THE
TSI
AWD
WAS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
APRIL
CONSUMER
REPORTS
TO
A
CAR
TO
AVOID
I
HAVE
BEEN
WONDERING
ABOUT
THAT
MYSELF
THE
AWD
MODELS
AND
THE
WERE
IDENTICAL
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
ABS
OPTION
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
MANUAL
TRANSMISSION
YES
SOME
OWNERS
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
TRANSAXLES
USING
SYNTHETIC
LUBRICANTS
IN
THE
TRANSAXLES
SOLVED
THE
PROBLEM
IN
MOST
CASES
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
NOT
UNIQUE
TO
THE
AWDS
HOWEVER
IT
WAS
COMMON
TO
ALL
MODELS
THE
GALANT
AND
GSX
HAD
THE
SAME
TRANSAXLE
BUT
I
DIDNT
SEE
THOSE
LISTED
IN
CR
ELECTRICAL
SYSTEM
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
ANY
MAJOR
COMPLAINTS
IN
THIS
AREA
EXCEPT
THAT
THE
BATTERY
THAT
WAS
INSTALLED
AT
THE
FACTORY
HAD
A
LOW
CURRENT
RATING
AND
BRAKES
WERE
BELOW
PAR
IN
BOTH
MODELS
THE
FIRST
FWD
MODELS
THOSE
BUILT
BEFORE
MAY
WERE
RECALLED
FOR
BRAKE
UPGRADES
SOME
FWD
AND
AWD
OWNERS
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
WARPED
ROTORS
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
INSIST
ON
USING
MANUAL
TORQUE
WRENCHES
EVERY
TIME
THE
LUG
NUTS
ARE
TIGHTENED
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
A
PROBLEM
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
OWNES
A
TSI
AWD
AND
HE
HAS
HAD
BRAKE
JOBS
PADS
I
CAN
REFER
YOU
TO
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
GONE
THROUGH
A
SET
OF
PADS
IN
ONE
DAY
IT
ALL
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
YOU
DRIVE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MOST
OWNERS
HAVE
BEEN
GETTING
BETWEEN
ON
A
SET
OF
PADS
ONE
STUCK
VALVE
FIRST
TIME
I
HEAR
ABOUT
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
VALVE
TRAIN
ON
THESE
CARS
OTHER
THAN
TIMING
BELT
FAILURES
AND
SOME
CLUTCHTRANSMISSION
PROBLEM
SOMETHING
ABOUT
STICKINGGRINDING
INTO
SECOND
GEAR
THIS
DOESNT
SEEM
TOO
BAD
IF
ONE
BEATS
ON
HIS
CAR
IF
YOUR
FRIEND
BEATS
ON
THE
CAR
THEN
HIS
UNIT
IS
NOT
A
REPRESENTATIVE
SAMPLE
OF
THE
CARS
RELIABILITY
MY
SUGGESTION
IS
INSTEAD
OF
LISTENING
TO
THE
USELESS
CONSUMER
REPORTS
TALK
TO
SEVERAL
OWNERS
THE
MAILING
LIST
MAY
BE
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
REACH
A
FEW
OF
THEM
I
AM
WILLING

SUFFER

BUCK

YOU
WANT
ALL
THREE

ANYONE
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
HOW
YOU
LIKE
