are
another
ten
reasons
why
we
should
all
love
cr
car
salesmen
love
their
new
car
buying
service
and
later
on
buying
a
cr
idealized
family
sedan
and
my
number
the
spectacle
of
the
religious
fervour
of
the
cr
true
believers
or
the
spectacle
of
macho
real
men
who
would
never
bother
to
read
the
magazine
but
are
more
than
apt
to
criticize
it
hey
im
a
macho
real
man
and
i
do
read
it
so
i
can
criticize
it
all
i
want
especially
since
i
pay
for
the
publication
they
accept
no
outside
advertising
dont
you
know

the
renaissance
was
just
something
that
happened
to
other
people
wasnt
it
the
black
adder
relying
on
consumer
reports
to
pick
your
automobiles
is
like
letting
field
stream
select
your
living
room
furniture

no
one
should
ever
rely
on
just
a
magazine
to
determine
what
car
they
buy
i
dont
care
what
magazine
btw
i
subscribe
to
three
other
auto
rags
i
just
think
cu
is
getting
a
bum
rap
by
these
macho
men
from
hell
who
think
real
men
should
read
statements
like
what
you
said
above
have
no
meaning
people
keep
on
saying
cu
is
only
good
for
dishwashing
detergent
or
as
you
saidrelying
on
consumer
reports
is
like
and
that
is
all
they
say
if
there
were
as
critical
of
themsevles
as
they
are
of
cu
maybe
there
would
be
some
real
content
