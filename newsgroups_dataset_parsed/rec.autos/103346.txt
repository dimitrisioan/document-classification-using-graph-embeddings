auto
wax
having
recently
purchased
a
probe
with
clearcoat
paint
i
would
like
to
give
it
a
good
wax
job
what
is
the
best
type
of
wax
to
use
for
this
type
of
finish
is
paste
or
liquid
better
i
would
be
waxing
it
by
hand
and
buffing
it
by
hand
i
guess
using
cheesecloth
to
buff
it
anything
better
you
would
suggest
ive
heard
comments
here
before
about
things
like
turtle
wax
and
raindance
not
being
very
good
so
im
wondering
what
is
recommended
for
a
quality
finish
thanks
in
advance
