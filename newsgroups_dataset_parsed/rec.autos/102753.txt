i
just
started
reading
this
thread
today
so
forgive
me
if
it
has
already
been
mentioned
butwhat
was
the
deal
with
renaults
putting
the
horn
on
the
lefthand
turnsignal
stalk
it
was
a
button
on
the
end
where
the
washer
button
would
be
on
the
wiperwasher
stalk
could
the
frenchies
not
figure
out
the
wiring
through
the
steering
wheel
or
what
well
before
we
start
calling
the
engineering
folks
in
france
a
bunch
of
braindeads
for
this
my
mercury
capri
had
this
lovely
feature
this
was
not
the
earlier
german
variant
but
the
newer
one
that
was
identical
to
the
mustang
of
current
fame
i
cant
tell
you
how
many
times
this
feature
pissed
me
off
come
to
think
of
it
my
brothers
zepher
had
this
as
well
robert
dilmore
dilmorecraycom
going
back
to
an
earlier
thread
imagine
having
to
turn
left
shift
gears
flash
a
stray
driver
in
the
intersection
with
your
lefthand
high
beam
on
the
headlight
stalk
and
after
the
driver
wouldnt
move
having
to
honk
the
horn
on
the
lefthand
stalk
gives
me
the
