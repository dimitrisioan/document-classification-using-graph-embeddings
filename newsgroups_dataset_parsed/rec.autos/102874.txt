wasnt
the
original

of
the
reverse
lights
for
the
driver
so
he
could
see
where
he
was
backing
up
although
reverse
lights
on

sides
no
reverse
lights
are
to
warn
others
that
you
are
backing
up
they
arent
bright
enough
to
typically
see
by
without
the
brake
and
tail
lights
are
useful
for
telling
whether
cars
are
backing
up
out
perpendicular
to
the
path
of
the
car
i
dont
think
warnings
were
their
original
intents
since
they
are
colored
white
well
red
and
orange
were
already
taken
maybe
white
defines
the
direction
that
the
car
is
moving
in
if
you
really
want
to
be
able
to
see
behind
you
get
some
fog
lamps
for
the
back
of
the
car
these
work
very
well
and
are
a
good
way
to
get
rid
of
tailgaters
