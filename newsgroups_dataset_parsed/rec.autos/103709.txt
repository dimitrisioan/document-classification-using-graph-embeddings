WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
JKJECWESTMINSTERACUK
SHAZAD
BARLAS
WRITES
DEREK
THERE
IS
A
TOOL
AVAILABLE
TO
RESET
THE
SERVICE
INDICATOR
ON
BMWS
BUT
THE
LIGHTS
WILL
COME
BACK
ON
AFTER
WEEKS
THE
TOOL
IS
IN
FACT
ILLEGAL
IN
EUROPE
ATLEAST
IT
IS
OFTEN
THE
CASE
THAT
THE
UNSUSPECTING
PUNTER
TROTS
OFF
TO
BUY
A
USED
BMW
AND
A
FEW
WEEKS
LATER
ALL
THE
LIGHTS
COME
ON
OTHER
THAN
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
NO
OTHER
TOOL
ANYONE
ELSE
SHAZ
HMM
BUT
THE
SERVICE
INDICATORS
THAT
I
HAVE
WORKS
THIS
WAY
THERE
ARE
YELLOW
RED
INDICATORS
INITIALLY
ALL
GREEN
INDICATORS
WILL
BE
ON
FOR
FEW
MINUTES
WHEN
YOU
START
YOUR
CAR
THE
COMPUTER
WILL
ACTUALLY
SENSE
HOW
YOU
DRIVE
YOUR
CAR
AND
AS
TIME
GOES
BY
THE
GREEN
INDICATORS
WILL
START
TO
GO
OFF
ONE
BY
ONE
AND
THEN
THE
YELLOW
INDICATOR
WILL
TURN
ON
AND
THEN
THE
RED
INDICATOR
WILL
GO
ON
AND
YOU
SHOULD
GET
SERVICE
WHEN
BY
THE
TIME
GREEN
INDICATORS
ARE
OFF
AFTER
SERVICE
THE
MECHANICOR
YOU
WILL
RESET
THE
SERVICE
INDICATORS
AND
THE
COMPUTER
STARTS
COUNTING
AGAIN
SO
I
EXPECT
TO
HAVE
A
TOOLOR
A
PROCEDURE
TO
RESET
IT
SO
THE
GREEN
LIGHTS
WILL
COME
ON
AND
THE
YELLOW
AND
RED
LIGHTS
WILL
GO
OFF
I
WONDER
HOW
PEOPLE
CAN
DO
OIL
CHANGE
THEMSELF
WITHOUT
KNOWING
HOW
TO
RESET
THE
INDICATOR
ITS
THE
FIRST
EUROPEAN
CAR
I
HAVE
AND
CHANGING
OIL
AT
MILES
IS
A
SURPRISE
TO
ME
AND
ITS
A
BIG
PLUS
BUT
I
WONDER
HOW
THAT
COULD
HAPPEN
SINCE
THE
OIL
LOSE
ITS
LUBRICATION
ABILITY
OVER
TIME
I
THOUGHT
ITS
THE
OIL
AND
NOT
THE
VEHICLE
THAT
DETERMINES
HOW
OFTEN
WE
SHOULD
CHANGE
OIL
ANY
BMW
OWNER
ON
THE
NET
RESPONSE
WELCOMED
PS
MY
INITIAL
QUESTION
IS
HOW
DO
YOU
SESET
THE
SERVICE
INDICATOR
OF
A
BMW
DEREK
THERE
IS
A
PERFECTLY
LEGAL
TOOL
AVAILABLE
TO
RESET
THE
BIMMER
SERVICE
LIGHTS
IT
WILL
COST
YOU
FROM
A
MAILORDER
AND
BUYING
ONE
FAR
OUTWEIGHS
THE
POSSIBLE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
DESTROYING
ALL
THE
ELECTRONICS
IF
YOU
TRY
DI
IT
YOURSELF
YOU
WONDER
HOW
PEOPLE
DO
AN
OIL
CHANGE
WITHOUT
KNOWING
HOW
IT
RESET
WHY
IS
RESETING
SO
IMPORTANT
THE
ONLY
REASON
FOR
DOING
IT
IS
STOP
THE
ANNOYANCE
OF
A
RED
LIGHT
STARING
AT
YOU
FORGET
THIS
IN
EUROPEAN
CARS
YOU
ONLY
NEED
TO
CHANGE
THE
OIL
EVERY
CRAP
ANYONE
SERIOUS
ABOUT
KEEPING
THEIR
ENGINE
IN
GOOD
SHAPE
AND
EXTENDING
ITS
LIFE
WILL
CHANGE
IT
EVERY
INC
FILTER
DONT
WAIT
FOR
THE
SERVIVE
LIGHTS
TO
COME
ON
BEFORE
SERVICING
THE
CAR
I
BOUGHT
A
BMW
ABOUT
MONTHS
AGO
IT
HAD
GREEN
LIGHTS
ON
I
HAVE
CHANGED
THE
OIL
EVERY
COMPLETLY
FLUSHED
BRAKE
FLIUD
CHANGED
ALL
FILTERSOIL
AIR
AND
FUEL
CHANGED
TRANSMISSION
AND
DRIVE
OILS
AND
DONE
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THE
OTHER
THINGS
REQ
FOR
SERVICE
AND
A
SERVICE
AFTER
NEARLY
MILES
I
AM
STILL
ON
GREEN
LIGHTS
AFTER
A
WINTER
IN
BURLINGTON
AND
IT
IS
SNOWING
TODAY
THAT
IS
NOT
BAD
GOOD
LUCK
