GEICO
I
WOULD
GLADLY
SPEND
TWICE
THE
MONEY
FOR
INSURANCE
RATHER
THAN
USING
GEICO
NOT
ONLY
DO
THEY
SUPPLY
RADAR
GUNS
TO
THE
POLICE
THEY
ALSO
WANT
TO
MAKE
RADAR
DETECTORS
ILLEGAL
THEY
ALSO
ASK
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
DETECTOR
PROBABLY
TO
PUT
YOU
IN
A
HIGH
RISK
GROUP
OR
JUST
REFUSE
TO
INSURE
YOU
I
KNOW
A
FEW
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
DROPED
BY
GEICO
DUE
TO
AN
ACCIDENT
THAT
WAS
NOT
THEIR
FAULT
