how
hard
is
a
carb
rebuild
for
moderately
experienced
backyard
mechanic
ive
done
my
clutch
and
miscellaneous
little
engine
fixes
the
hardest
part
is
usually
getting
the
darned
thing
off
the
intake
manifold
rebuilding
a
carb
is
fun
if
youre
into
things
with
lots
of
little
parts
i
used
to
rebuild
them
for
all
my
friends
cars
in
high
school
so
it
doesnt
take
a
phd
buy
a
carb
rebuilding
kit
from
an
auto
supply
store
buy
a
gallon
of
the
best
carb
cleaning
solvent
you
can
find
do
they
still
make
tyme
as
a
rule
of
thumb
buy
the
one
with
the
scariest
warning
labels
put
it
into
a
metal
bucket
make
yourself
a
dipping
can
by
punching
holes
in
the
bottom
of
a
coffee
can
and
attaching
a
wire
handle
to
it
if
the
carb
cleaner
doesnt
strip
the
paint
right
off
the
coffee
can
youre
not
using
the
right
stuff
use
the
can
to
soak
the
little
stuff
and
just
hang
the
big
parts
from
a
coat
hanger
wash
them
off
with
a
garden
hose
wipe
off
excess
water
with
paper
towels
and
air
dry
then
remember
where
all
the
little
parts
go
follow
the
rebuild
kits
instructions
concerning
float
height
choke
tension
etc
bolt
it
back
on
the
engine
and
admire
the
superclean
carb
on
the
filthy
engine
heed
this
mans
warnings
if
you
get
carb
cleaner
this
strong
on
your
hands
your
hands
will
be
eaten
away
not
pretty
hence
the
dipping
can
method
later
