i
am
currently
in
the
car
market
and
would
like
opinions
on
a
vw
passat
glx
how
does
it
compare
to
a
toyota
camry
i
thought
the
car
looked
very
solid
stable
and
european
only
disappointment
so
far
is
that
that
it
doesnt
offer
an
airbao
my
next
question
is
why
isnt
vw
offering
automobiles
with
airbags
should
i
pay
the
extra
three
thousand
for
a
bmw
is
even
though
it
is
smaller
and
less
powerful
than
than
the
passat
i
think
vw
got
caught
out
on
the
airbag
thing
its
only
been
in
the
last
year
or
two
that
airbags
have
become
a
significant
selling
feature
vw
assumed
that
automatic
belts
would
satisfy
govt
requirements
for
passive
restraint
but
didnt
guess
that
the
merican
consumer
would
actually
make
buy
decisions
based
on
the
presence
of
an
airbag
vw
is
really
hurting
right
now
in
the
us
market
check
out
the
article
in
last
weeks
autoweek
about
the
crisis
at
vw
golfs
and
jettas
will
be
coming
from
the
plant
in
mexico
but
they
dont
have
the
quality
at
that
facility
as
per
normal
vw
practice
the
us
launch
of
the
jetta
iii
is
delayed
again
and
again
until
a
good
chunk
of
the
useful
life
of
the
design
is
spent
i
think
that
passats
come
from
germany
so
there
is
not
the
same
quality
and
availability
issue
its
a
nice
car
with
a
nice
engine
whether
vw
will
be
a
player
in
the
us
market
in
two
years
time
is
a
different
question
ill
leave
the
passat
camry
flamewar
for
someone
else
