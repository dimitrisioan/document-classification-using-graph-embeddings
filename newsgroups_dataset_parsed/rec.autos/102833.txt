eagle
talon
tsilemon
dear
netters
i
am
looking
to
buy
a
used
eagle
talon
or
tsi
awd
question
is
that
the
tsi
awd
was
mentioned
in
the
april
consumer
reports
to
a
car
to
avoid
in
particular
the
manual
transmission
electrical
system
and
brakes
were
below
par
in
both
models
a
friend
of
mine
ownes
a
tsi
awd
and
he
has
had
brake
jobs
pads
one
stuck
valve
and
some
clutchtransmission
problem
something
about
stickinggrinding
into
second
gear
this
doesnt
seem
too
bad
if
one
beats
on
his
car
i
am
willing
to
suffer
reliabilityfor
speed
and
looks
seems
you
have
to
pay
big
buck
if
you
want
all
three
anyway
can
anyone
please
let
me
know
how
you
like
your
talon
and
any
problems
you
may
have
had
and
if
the
repairs
are
worth
it
thanks
for
any
responses
jay
