of
the
interceptors
mad
max
tony
i
believe
first
of
all
that
maxs
car
is
an
austrailian
built
car
i
dont
think
its
a
chopped
up
us
unit
it
may
be
called
a
kangaroo
or
roo
or
something
similarnot
sure
but
i
do
recall
reading
that
austrailian
cars
used
ford
engines
the
ford
interceptor
is
i
think
a
ci
cop
car
motor
whatever
the
case
that
small
car
with
a
screaming
big
block
ford
would
probably
smoke
the
tires
for
mileskilometers
i
hope
someone
out
there
can
elaborate
on
the
subject
smoke
em
hard
smoke

fast
