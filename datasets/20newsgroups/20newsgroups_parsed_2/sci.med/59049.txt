writes
convincing
evidence
disease
exists
theres
lot
evidence
hasnt
adequately
gathered
published
way
convince
diehard
melancholic
skeptics
quiver
everytime
word
anecdote
empirical
used
snort
ah
go
sinuses
example
dr
ivker
wrote
book
sinus
survival
always
gives
oh
wow
classic
textbook
hey
laughed
einstein
treatment
systemic
antifungal
nizoral
new
patients
theyve
braodspectrum
antibiotics
times
last
two
years
hes
kept
record
results
patients
found
patients
get
significant
relief
allergicsinus
symptoms
course
beginning
program
yeah
ill
bet
tomorrow
world
listen
uncontrolled
studies
like
worthless
case
reported
weeks
ago
developing
classic
symptoms
outlined
yeast
connection
agree
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
plastics
vapors
etc
never
started
november
within
one
week
full
dosage
sporanox
sensitivity
chemicals
fully
disappeared
sit
couch
home
without
dying
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
areas
well
im
sure
sound
like
typical
hysterichypochondriac
responds
miracle
cures
course
allergy
symptoms
etc
especially
allergic
molds
yeasts
etc
doesnt
take
rocket
scientist
figure
one
excessive
colonization
yeast
body
natural
allergy
yeasts
threshold
would
reached
would
perceptible
symptoms
yeah
makes
sense
course
taken
seriously
snort
also
yeast
produce
toxins
various
sorts
dont
rocket
scientist
realize
toxins
cause
problems
people
yeah
sounds
reasonable
course
question
whether
person
immune
compromised
tests
showed
years
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
stress
infections
allergies
etc
oh
really
tests
immunecompromised
ass
like
credulous
malingerer
psychiatric
syndrome
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
body
tough
question
answer
since
testing
excessive
yeast
colonization
easy
one
almost
take
empirical
approach
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
careful
however
theres
reason
longer
withhold
sporanox
treatment
empirical
reasons
know
shame
drug
like
itraconazole
misused
way
ridiculously
expensive
potentially
toxic
trouble
isnt
toxic
enough
gets
abused
quacks
btw
would
say
try
nystatin
unfortunately
yeast
grows
hyphae
deep
tissue
nystatin
permanent
affect
youll
find
lot
people
nystatin
time
good
thing
nystatin
relatively
cheap
taken
orally
nontoxic
oral
nystatin
without
systemic
effect
unless
given
iv
would
without
effect
sinuses
wish
quacks
would
first
use
iv
nystatin
amphotericin
b
people
like
would
solve
yeast
problem
summary
appreciate
attempts
desire
keep
medicine
right
road
methinks
hold
firmly
party
line
academics
havent
trenches
long
enough
actually
treating
patients
anybody
doctors
included
said
face
evidence
yeast
connection
guarantee
safety
incompetence
ripping
lips
justified
far
concerned
perhaps
little
haldol
would
go
long
way
towards
ameliorating
symptoms
paying
treatment
pocket
id
hate
think
insurance
premiums
going
