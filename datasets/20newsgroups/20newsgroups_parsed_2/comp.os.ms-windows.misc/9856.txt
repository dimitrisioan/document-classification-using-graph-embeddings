risc
means
reduced
instruction
set
computer
risc
usually
small
instruction
set
reduce
circuit
complex
increase
clock
rate
high
performance
read
books
computer
architecture
information
risc
hmm
authority
risc
clearly
remember
reading
instruction
set
risc
cpus
rather
large
difference
addressing
modes
risc
instruction
sets
orthogonal
cisc
theoretically
supposed
reduced
longer
thats
everyone
arguing
risc
vs
cisc
personally
think
cisc
win
take
look
pentium
like
intel
architectures
either
thats
another
story
bye
mean
pentium
better
risc
outsell
first
remember
intel
cisc
like
pentium
always
generation
away
best
riscs
also
riscs
cpu
costly
sold
quantities
even
order
remember
reading
years
maybe
hypercube
mips
superscallar
reordered
instruction
im
sure
think
mhz
transputer
ya
tie
gazillion
together
get
mips
newest
kicks
anyones
butt
havent
seen
used
much
though
anyway
respond
think
pentium
cisc
better
advanced
risc
eg
like
alpha
etc
mhz
pentium
approximately
performance
superduper
mhz
alpha
performance
weird
specint
everyone
refers
heard
alpha
still
kicks
ps
butt
fp
heard
computing
world
sell
lots
chips
like
intel
make
faster
like
intel
winner
like
intel
even
though
sucky
architecture
years
ago
like
intel
make
cisc
chip
superscalar
superduperpipelined
superfast
ideas
behind
risc
ideology
got
cisc
chip
admit
cant
see
advantages
risc
cisc
latest
technology
generation
behind
sucks
relatively
speaking
may
sound
like
like
intel
ill
say
p
real
kick
butt
pile
si
sio
hope
motorola
really
catches
k
line
im
gon
na
start
crying
