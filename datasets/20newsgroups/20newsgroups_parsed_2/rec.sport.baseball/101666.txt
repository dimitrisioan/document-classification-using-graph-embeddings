youre

bob

bob

anything

john
saying
batters

probably
correct
mean
wins
losses
means
something
would
rather
player
increased

thus
appears

certainly

win

remember

thus
im
sure
given

add

team
add

sometimes
add
one
sometime
less
one
also
pitchers
bad

giving

may

realize

gives

equal

given
first
inning
look

giving

lose
many
games
hand

gives

still
leaves

something
saying

equally

either
runs

really

many

pitcher
gives

heres
another

experiment
apply
