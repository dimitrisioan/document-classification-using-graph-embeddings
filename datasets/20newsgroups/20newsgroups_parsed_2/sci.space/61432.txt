interesting
questions
wonder
whether
moon
could
ever

best
example
human
endurance
terms
altitude
ie
low
atmospheric
pressure
lower
oxygen
partial

mt
everest
without

mountaineers
trained
high

quite
awhile

high
pressure
situations
would
limited
duration
time
takes
slowly
acclimate
higher
pressure
skin
divers
would
know
alot
high
pressure
situations
could
tell
safely
make
deep
dives
without
getting
bends
military
experiments
put
people
several
atmospheres
pressure
sure
high
limit

call
