participate
us
way
contribute
comprehensive
document
released
general
public
around
world
document
would
scientifically
analyze
technical
aspects
long

human
habitation
space
general
public
going
interested
technical
details
long
term
space
habitation
like
idea
study
released
scientists
engineers
able
use
want
general
public
document
youll
need
general
publication
believe
longterm
space
exploration
program
succeed
need
basically
learn
engineer
microworld
ie
spacecraft
careful
analyses
engineering
chemical
biological
medical
factors
good

engineering
microworld
isnt

problem
understanding

efficiently
example
way
know
produce
food
plants
animals
food
synthesis
far
advanced
orbit
farm
well
thats
obviously
efficient
use
technology
reduce
mass
grow
plants
hydroponically
instead
using
dirt
engineering
comes
new
technologies
bring
new
basic
questions
dont
answers
like
dirt
grow
tomatoes
lettuce
right
beside
hydroponics
turns
cant
lettuce
growth

hydroponic
solution
tomatoes
consider
plants
going
similar
interactions
means
basic
applied
scientific
research
thats
needs
done
technologies
developed
far
also
need
find
interact
together
thats
would
like
see
posts
opinions
regarding
objective
methods
analyze
accepted
scientific
literature
technologies
applied
longduration
spaceflight
first
need
literature
search
lot
information
maybe
pick
specific
area
long
term
habitation
could
useful
especially
make
available
net
look
methods
analyzing
technologies
detailed
literature
search
would
interest
space
advocates
clearly
important
existing
space
programs
essence
would
dividing
space
life
science
issues
various
technical
problems
could
solved
various
technologies
database
acceptable
solutions
various
problems
could
form
basis
detailed

bionet
isunet
source
unless
unbelievable
outpouring
interest
net
think
develop
detailed
data
base
literature
search
first
accomplish
go
real
