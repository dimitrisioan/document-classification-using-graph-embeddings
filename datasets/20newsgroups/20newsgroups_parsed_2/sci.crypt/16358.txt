think
couple
ways
guaranteeing
authenticity
onetime
pad
encrytped
scheme
though
im
sure
prove

authenicity
provide

problem
im
sure
impossible
come
message
hash
crc
regardless
random
starting
block
intuitively
seems
like
ought
hard
im
sure
clearly
cryptostrength
hash
like
md
sha
would
stronger
im
sure
im
comfortable
claiming
unbreakable
scheme
use
pad

decide
many

going
wouldnt
bad
either
cost
increasing
speed
use
pad
could
used
give
arbitrarily

could
spoof

im
trying

quantify

gets

without

equivalent
correctly
