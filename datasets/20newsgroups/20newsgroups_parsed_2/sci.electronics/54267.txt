hey
someone
clue
weird
types
amplifiers
brief
intro
concepts
behind
would
cool
clues
type
b
ab
already
stuff
ones
mentioned
occasionally
dont
know
think
type
like
pwm
scheme
something
thanx
advanced
whole
point
weird
amplifier
types
improved
efficiency
class
amps
pwm
pulse
width
modulation
amps
work
much
like
switching
power
supplies
think
ive
seen
things
called
class
well
theyre
capable
high
efficiencies
would
suitable
high
power
ive
yet
see
anything
like
used
audiophile
amp
though
ive
trying
design
threekilowatter
last
year
used
inverter
ups
serious
problems
layout
parasitics
irf
parallel
help
doable
isolated
drive
ckt
would
appreciated
im
absolutely
positive
beleive
class
g
amp
one
operates
variable
switched
power
supply
rail
voltage
carver
amps
something
like
use
sort
phasecontrol
circuit
fully
understand
operation
reduce
transformer
size
beleive
patented
apart
trying
fix
found
three
rail
voltages
switched
ran
simulation
pspice
found
topology
would
greatly
reduce
power
dissipation
heat
largesignal
conditions
driving
reactive
loads
draw
high
current
zerovoltage
crossings
think
speaker
dr
diode
great
sound
starts
source
