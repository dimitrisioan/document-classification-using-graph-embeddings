hello
let
introduce
problem
measure
sinusoidal
wave
voltage
digital
voltmeter
using
ac
mode
output
rms
value
peak
value
squared
right
measure
square
wave
mode
ac
output
equal
peak
value
actually
upper
flat
boundary
wave
assumed
digital
voltmeter
makes
kind
integration
input
value
divides
wave
period
right
used
measure
square
wave
distorted
highfrequency
harmonics
ideally
output
output
value
previous
one
nature
output
value
voltmeter
actually
measure
show
rms
readings
unless
dvm
says
measuring
rms
probably
average
voltage
input
diode
rectified
measured
dc
says
rms
measures
squaretriangleetc
incorrectly
measuring
average
multipling
correction
thats
true
sine
waves
ie
vave
vrms
want
correct
rms
waveform
need
truerms
dvmdmm
literally
rootmeansquare
calculation
either
analog
digital
circuitry
related
question
less
important
advantages
disadvantages
digital
voltmeters
compare
analog
ones
last
significant
advantage
analog
imo
able
see
signal
changing
time
eg
checking
electrolytic
capacitors
anymore
dmm
bargraphs
etc
duplicate
thank
attention
could
mail
opinion
open
discussion
would
appreciate
either
way
