im
wondering
possible
use
radio
waves
measure
distance
transmitters
receiver
yes
called
radar
well
actually
quite
radar
radioaltimeters
measure
distances
measuring
time
required
transmit
signal
receive
reflection
target
radar
generally
uses
pulses
radio
altimeters
use
either
pulses
modulated
continuouswave
transmission
case
latter
highly
accurate
distance
measurement
made
example
original
bendix
ala
radio
altimeter
accurate
foot
feet
altitude
note
however
different
method
measuring
poster
originally
asked
problem
gaining
accurate
measurements
transmitter
seperate
receiver
need
highly
accurate
time
base
starts
receiver
exact
instant
transmitter
triggers
wire
connected
since
radio
waves
actually
travel
faster
freespace
air
case
wire
difference
called
velocity
factor
cable
need
resort
common
timebase
automatically
corrected
distance
etc
something
like
pll
connected
gps
receiver
trick
triggering
transmitter
receiver
simultaneously
sound
expensive
bad
plan
spending
bucks
equipment
effort
go
different
method
surveyors
use
laserlight
system
reflection
time
measured
try
sounds
like
something
pe
know
anyway
seems
able
measure
signal
strength
determine
distance
would
short
distances
ft
would
need
accuracy
inches
actually
highly
inaccurate
since
power
output
transmitter
varies
unit
unit
variances
antenna
transmission
line
receiver
may
also
vary
unit
unit
unit
time
would
need
continuously
calibrate
entire
system
radio
altimeter
also
done
since
everything
located
one
place
much
easier
note
especially
time
base
ra
receiver
transmitter
one
unit
also
depends
environment
static
environent
waveguide
yes
dynamic
environment
objects
moving
multipath
kills
concept
nope
fm
capture
effect
says
strongest
signal
wins
unless
two
interfering
signals
seperated
db
signal
strength
one
problem
makes
altimeters
inaccurate
low
altitudes
signals
bouncing
runways
tend
strong
frequencies
would
best
matter
high
possible
eliminate
outside
influence
also
enhance
attenuation
multipath
signals
radio
altimeters
typically
use
frequencies
around
ghz
hope
helps
