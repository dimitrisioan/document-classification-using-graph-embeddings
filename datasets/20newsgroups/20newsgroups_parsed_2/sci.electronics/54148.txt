switching
ps
questions
anyways
ive
built
basic
converters
pretty
good
results
efficiency
im
running
problems
try
design
build
anything
puts

im
using
simple
choke
storage
element
basicly
toroid
single

commercial
models
use
transformers
many
windings
traced
seem
use

usual

others
seem
loose
better
anyone
full

one
could
get

commercial
switchers
use

anyone
whos

either

need

ensure
