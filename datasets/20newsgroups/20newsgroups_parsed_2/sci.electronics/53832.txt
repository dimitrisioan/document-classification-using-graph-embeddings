outputs
graphics
card
able
detect
presence
single

mhz
would
mean
detecting
ns
pulse
also
able
tell
difference
blank

mv
dim
screen
say
around

oh
yes
also
needs
cheap

first
problem
compariator
way
slow
needed
get
several
pixels
row
would
fire
compariators
could
whole

circuit
would
detect

wondering
going
amplify
video
signals
make
work
faster
compariators
expensive
require
split
supplies
would
need
replace
quad
compariator
three
compariators
create
whole
new

help
ideas
tips

etc
would
greatly
appreciated
oh
yes
sample
output
thing
every
second
dont
need
fast
response
time
however
havent
found
way
take
advantage
fact
thanks
lot
help
anybody
might
