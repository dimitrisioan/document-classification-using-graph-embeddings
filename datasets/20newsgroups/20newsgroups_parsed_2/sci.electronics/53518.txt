buying
one

function
generator
mv
offset
amplitudes
high
way
could
make
little
box
could
solve
little
problem
box
would
tkae
function
generator
input
lower
voltage
give
output
impedance
low
unchanging
number
would
want
lower
voltage
factor
one
hundred
could
build
little
buffer
amp
id
like
box
active
sure
youve
already
got
right
idea
ignoring
ohm
internal
resistance
generator
second
run
say
voltage
divider
made
ohms
series
ohms
new
circuit
thevenin
equivalent
one
puts
original
voltage
output
impedence
negligibly
less
ohms
may
want
monkey
values
little
depending
whether
care
exact
dividing

kolstad
ps
high
voltage
probes
multimeters
accurate
still
cheap
something
like
megs
series
k
doesnt
load
often
high
impedence
source
much
well
keeping
probably
meg
impedance
multimeter
happy
