question
throw
guys
class
project
need
design
build
power
supply
following
specs
voltatge
adjustable
v
current
limited
voltage
must
stay
within
designated
value
ac
ripple
less

course
cant
use

current
limiting
ie
weve
found
stuff
rest
parts
circuit
supply
must
presented
load
would
draw
given
supply
voltage
reduce
voltage
current
equal
one
amp
thus
short
thing
ammeter
read
one
amp
measure
current
ohm
resistor

output
voltage
necessity
must
v
basic
idea
seen
current
limiter
involves
circuit
pull
current
base
output
power
transistor
therefore
reduce
output
anybody
ideas
could
work
thanks
advance
andy
collins
kcyey
ps
anybody
wants
flame
stupid
project
agree
fully
still
graded
