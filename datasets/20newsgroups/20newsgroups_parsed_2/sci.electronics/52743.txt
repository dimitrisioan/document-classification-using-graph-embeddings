every
two

want

problem
trying
build
timer
would
stand
cold
degrees
power
source
wouldnt
drain
looked
xr
timers
standard
ne
dual
timers
thier
temp
specs
wont
go
low
also
two
weeks
equates
seconds
per
firing
means
one
big
timing
cap
found
farad
yes
farad
caps
working
voltage
volts
small
size
time
discharge
lower
degrees
isnt
linear
thinking
using
several
timers
chained
together
fire
selonid
end
timing
period
blasted
cold
drain
battery
six
weeks
pain
one
possibility
would
use
solar
panels
six
month
twilight
anyone
good
ideas
thanks
advance
wes
firstly
would
never
consider
trying
make
oneshot
timer
f
cap
designed
ram
battery
substitute
rather
use
applications
wish
drain
cap
constant
current
performance
respects
akin
batteries
normal
cap
point
big
electros
usually
rated
tolerances
calculating
exactly
capacitance
particularly
considering
cold
looking
designing
micropower
oscillator
divider
chain
rolls
zero
maximum
count
viceversa
every
seconds
use
something
like
hz
clock
would
need
divider
chain
give
error
less
one
percent
firing
times
six
week
period
course
could
trim
hz
oscillator
give
exact
time
likelyhood
oscillator
remaining
exactly
constant
low
anyway
would
suspect
would
far
battrey
drain
firing
solenoid
would
timer
circuit
caveat
im
experienced
low
temperature
electronics
cant
guarantee
approach
