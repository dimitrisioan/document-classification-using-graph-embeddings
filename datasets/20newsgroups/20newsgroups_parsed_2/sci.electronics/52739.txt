oh
youre
one
analogue
scopes
give
least
fair
idea
whats
going
circuit
digital
scopes
seem
habit
inventing
sizable
part
eg
even
samples
per
period
hpa
displays
continuous
waveform
complete
nonexisting
overshoots
ive
waded
lots
manual
pages
menus
havent
found
yet
turn
doesnt
show
points
actually
measured
opposed
interpolated
either
perhaps
youre
using
wrong
brand
sorry
hp
fans
hard
time
convinced
scopes
match
rest
excellent
gear
one
principal
functions
look
considering
dso
whether
turn
interpolation
important

disable
repetitive
waveform
acquisition
ie
able

real

secondly
dont
like

want
see
common

youll
guessed
love
analogue
tek
scopes
id
choose
knob
printed
legend
onscreen
display
updown
buttons
right
away
single
knob
digital
instruments
never
seems
connected
right
function
right
moment
agree
consolation
manufacturers
beginning
pay
attention
ergonomics
designing
menus
however
fair
seems
first
time
scope
users
students
seem
adjust
menus
easier
navigating
around
twenty
knobs
required
real
scope
last
least
never
know
waveform
displayed
old
recent
noisy
incoherently
modulated
heck
dont
even
know
really
looks
way
displayed
digital
scopes
show
tiny
fraction
whats
going
time
busy
computing

also
matches
equivalent
analogue

menus
least
appear
logically
laid
three

would
prefer
