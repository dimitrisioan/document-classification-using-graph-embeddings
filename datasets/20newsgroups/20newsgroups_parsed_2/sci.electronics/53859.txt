someone
please
tell
decoder
demultiplexer
know
link
get
output
circuit
link
make
multiplexer
sorry
seems
like
lame
question
im
newbie

please
make

decoder
need
demultiplexer
although
many
commercial
ssi
implementations
allow
use
one
strictly
decoder
need
take
two
lines
make
one
output
change
state
according
inputs
demux
hand
uses
two
control

determine
four
outputs
reflect

eg
high

select

demuxes

thus
achieve
aim
one
output
eight
reflecting

note
method

create

decoder
left
commit
enable

intended
purpose
sixteen
way
decoder
obviously
requires
four
fourway
decoders
plus
mechanism
enable
one
four
time
therefore
use
fifth
decoder
attached
two
high
order
bits
provide
four
enable
lines
course
two
low
order
bits
must
connected
parallel
four
final
stage
decoders
