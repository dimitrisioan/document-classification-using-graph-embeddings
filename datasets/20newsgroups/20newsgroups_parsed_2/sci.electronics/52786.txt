hi
ive
built
valve
preamp
use
diodecapacitor
voltage

resistance
increases
rc

decreases
hence
output
voltage
drops
need
high

voltage
possible
v
circuit
consists
seven
voltage
multiplier
stages
ie

anyone
recomend

possible
ive
got
preamp
moment
much
distraction
im
university
ive
got
get
dissertation
finished
two
weeks
hence
im
mailing
playing
solderoing
iron
itll
cheaper
long
run
especially
new
large
capacitors
dont
work
planned
email
please
cant
always
