imo
although

inevitable
team
improve
player
lemieux
gretzky
simply
make
people
around
better
winning

emergence
teemu
selanne
th
best
record
hockey
sure
hell
isnt
winning
yes
worse
last
year
think
type
reasoning
applied
new
pittsburgh
fan
applies
extra
people
showing
winnipeg
games
difficult
predict
think
jets
miss
playoffs
next
season
year
maintain
attendance
levels
seriously
doubt
case
expectation
improving
team
would
gone
without
selanne
provide
example
rocket
ismail
toronto
argonauts
cfldid
leave
dont
know
much
cfl
thats
case
fair
enough
