also
interested
looking
xview
code
mentioned
theres
documentation
use
shared
memory
extension
xr
distribution
actually
finished
writing
motif
animation
program
takelotsofimagedataanddisplayitprettydarnfast
using
onserver
pixmaps
shared
memory
insert
delay
loop
keep
going
quickly
testing
methods
side
side
equal
advantage
shm
x
server
doesnt
grow
ridiculous
sizes
pixmaps
work
network
removed
application
dies
one
tends
use
ipcrm
manually
quite
bit
debugging
shm
apps
shared
memory
also
problem
operating
systems
eg
ultrix
seem
allow
small
number
segments
attached
process
consequently
redraw
becomes
xshmattachxshmputimagexshmdetach
dec
systems
decs
bit
displays
like
ones
tend
use
often
dont
seem
support
extension
maybe
someone
compiled
wrong
using
pixmaps
causes
x
server
crash
failed
mallocs
one
use
local
unix
domain
socket
really
isnt
bad
one
copies
info
three
times
per
redraw
instead
one
short
allowing
three
forms
display
within
program
good
thing
minus
shm
running
network
let
user
pick
whatever
feels
fastest
use
ximagehandler
class
