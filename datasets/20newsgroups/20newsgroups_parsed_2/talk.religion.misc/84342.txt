ok
makes

youve

disagreements
circumstances
ironed
theres
little
hope
everyone
agreeing
say
practical

frame

thus
good
isnt
approximately
objective
way
usually
expect

yes

thats

ive
encountered

hear

isnt
rather
sensible
first
guess
immoral
act
even
though
conceivably
might

would

youve

supermajority
relativists

thus
wrong
almost

theyre
