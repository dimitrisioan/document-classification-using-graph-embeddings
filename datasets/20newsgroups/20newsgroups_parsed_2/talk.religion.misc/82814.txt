mr

ask
could
sure
money
judas

land
indeed
betrayal
rather
source
would
point
acts
specifically
mention
reward
iniquity
acts
also
specifically
mentions
act
iniquity
talking
ie
acts
concerning
judas
guide
arrested
jesus
would
point
bible
describes
act
iniquity
immediately
discusses
reward
iniquity
would
rather
inane
suggest
action
iniquity
one
discussed
notice
verse

states

peter

acts
specifically
call
judas
betrayal
iniquity
matter
neither
john
specifically
call
judas
actions
iniquity
either
john
say
judas
took
money
box
rather
said
thought
judas
money
box
jesus
telling
buy
need
feast
give
something
poor
receiving
morsel
immediately
went
night
note
said
judas
left
say
took
money
box
thus
see
explanation
still
seems
would
choose
unproven
iniquity
mentioned
another
author
different
book
written
different
time
iniquity
explicitly
mentioned
author
acts
find
forced
contrived
course
particular
argument
becomes
moot
since
seen
evidence
apacgw
means
suicide
see
since
judas
hanging
successful
could
spent
money
mentioned
john
matthew
mark
explicitly
say
betrayal
high
holy
day
ie
passover
thus
could
spent
money
killing
next
day
thus
money
bought
field
blood
would
pieces
silver
course
got
pieces
silver
night
well
thus
couldnt
spent
either
