yes
placed
great

gotten

emphasis
quarters
press
ive
simply
taken

tried
see
thats
doesnt
take
lot
time
president
say
believe
intend
thats
ill
continue
q
mr
president
getting
back
situation
bosnia
understand
havent
made
final
decisions
new
options
previously
considered
unacceptable
two
commonly
heard
options
would
lifting
arms
embargo
enable
bosnian
muslims
defend
initiate
limited
air
strikes
perhaps
cut
supply
lines
without
telling

decision
presumably
havent
made

two
options
pros
cons
going
mind
right
weigh
heavily
final

president
im
reluctant
get
two
options
options
considered
pluses
minuses
supporters
opponents
within

question
obviously
widen
capacity
people
fight
help
get
settlement
bring

kind
reaction
others
would
undermine

policy
think
deserve
serious
consideration
along

q
think
people
trying
