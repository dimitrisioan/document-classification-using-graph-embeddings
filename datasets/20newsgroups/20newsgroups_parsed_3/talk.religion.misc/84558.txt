perhap
you
should
read
it
and
stop
advanc
the
bibl
a
evid
relat
to
question
of
scienc
it
did
jesu
exist
by
g
a
well
there
is
a
great
fallaci
in
your
statement
the
question
of
origin
is
base
on
more
than
scienc
alon
nope
no
fallaci
yep
scienc
is
best
in
determin
how
religion
handl
whi
and
who
rich
i
am
curiou
a
to
whi
you
and
other
award
custodi
of
the
babi
to
theist
and
religion
i
hope
i
didnt
award
custodi
rich
i
purpos
use
handl
in
order
to
avoid
do
so
ie
that
happen
to
be
what
religion
do
of
cours
there
are
aberr
like
scientif
creation
i
use
best
in
part
to
indic
that
scienc
current
ha
a
time
of
it
with
whi
and
who
so
these
domain
are
mostli
ignor
i
also
attempt
to
be
brief
which
no
doubt
confus
the
matter
a
an
asid
for
scienc
i
should
have
written
how
and
when
nobodi
seem
to
argu
over
what
are
they
theist
theologian
ani
better
equip
to
investig
the
who
and
whi
than
magician
astrolog
housew
not
be
sexist
athiest
or
agnost
seem
to
me
that
the
answer
would
vari
from
individu
to
individu
im
not
tri
to
be
evas
on
thi
but
from
a
societ
perspect
religion
work
on
the
other
hand
sometim
it
is
abus
and
misus
and
mani
suffer
which
you
know
but
the
net
result
seem
posit
thi
from
the
anthropolog
perspect
on
human
affair
you
might
call
me
a
neofruedian
insofar
a
i
think
the
mass
cant
get
along
without
religion
not
that
gener
they
are
incap
they
just
dont
and
for
myriad
reason
but
the
main
one
seem
to
be
the
promis
of
immort
veri
seduct
that
immort
therefor
it
seem
that
theologian
are
better
equip
than
the
other
you
mention
for
dispens
answer
to
who
and
whi
i
suggest
that
thi
hold
regardless
of
the
truth
in
their
answer
to
who
and
whi
simpli
becaus
peopl
believ
in
the
end
spiritu
belief
are
just
a
real
a
scientif
fact
and
explan
caution
to
some
do
not
take
thi
out
of
context
do
you
suggest
that
the
who
and
whi
will
forev
be
close
to
scientif
investig
no
in
fact
i
dont
think
it
is
close
now
at
least
for
some
individu
isnt
there
a
group
of
theoret
physicist
who
argu
that
matter
wa
creat
from
noth
in
a
big
bang
singular
thi
approach
might
presuppos
an
absenc
of
who
and
whi
except
that
it
seem
it
could
be
argu
that
someth
had
to
be
respons
for
noth
mayb
that
someth
doesnt
have
to
be
supernatur
mayb
just
mechanist
but
that
a
tough
one
for
peopl
today
to
grasp
in
ani
case
theori
without
empir
data
is
not
explan
but
then
your
question
doe
not
requir
data
in
other
word
i
agre
that
theoriz
within
scientif
paramet
is
just
a
scientif
a
explain
so
the
answer
is
who
and
whi
are
not
close
to
scientist
but
i
sen
that
scienc
in
these
realm
is
current
veri
inadequ
data
will
be
necessari
for

that
