write
these
law
written
for
the
israelit
god
chosen
peopl
whom
god
had
expressli
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelit
were
a
direct
wit
to
god
exist
to
disobey
god
after
know
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefor
immedi
punish
rememb
these
law
were
written
for
a
differ
time
and
appli
onli
to
god
chosen
peopl
but
jesu
ha
chang
all
of
that
we
are
live
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immedi
punish
by
death
there
is
repent
and
there
is
salvat
through
our
lord
jesu
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
peopl
salvat
is
avail
to
everyon
jew
and
gentil
alik
sorri
if
thi
is
late
for
the
thread
but
i
thought
god
wa
suppos
to
be
constant
and
neverchang
how
do
you
reconcil
thi
common
christian
view
with
the
paragraph
abov
god
never
chang
sorri
but
ye
he
doe
by
your
own
descript
he
still
love
u
send
jesu
wa
one
of
hi
attempt
to
reconcil
with
mankind
humor
thi
notion
of
an
allknow
allpow
god
who
must
attempt
to
reconcil
with
hi
lowli
creation
i
realiz
that
it
is
not
possibl
to
penetr
such
logic
but
is
there
ani
chanc
that
you
might
consid
that
an
omnipot
god
need
not
attempt
anyth
and
further
that
an
attempt
to
reconcil
impli
a
lack
of
omnisci
what
you
are
do
here
is
project
human
weak
onto
your
god
also
while
were
at
it
how
do
you
reconcil
a
kind
and
love
god
with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
wa
at
one
time
immedi
punish
by
death
wa
kill
peopl
for
sin
god
way
of
show
kind
and
love
sin
in
the
face
of
god
wa
punish
by
immedi
death
there
are
sever
ot
passag
to
back
thi
up
god
is
god
but
all
human
are
sinner
thu
all
prejesu
human
should
have
been
punish
with
death
we
arent
punish
with
sin
now
of
cours
becaus
god
ha
chang
he
requir
a
brutal
sadist
sacrific
of
hi
own
blood
in
order
to
allow
u
to
sin
without
immedi
death
he
can
not
toler
the
prescenc
of
sin
in
hi
midst
yet
he
doe
so
now
he
ha
chang
the
sadist
murder
of
hi
own
son
ha
made
him
more
toler
of
our
sin
besid
hi
midst
is
everywher
so
your
statement
is
meaningless
he
toler
sin
in
hell
which
sure
is
in
hi
midst
a
well
also
given
that
he
is
allknow
he
must
have
etern
knowledg
of
who
will
commit
which
sin
a
well
a
when
and
where
so
what
doe
toler
have
to
do
with
anyth
all
of
thi
is
absolut
nonsens
unless
your
god
is
not
inde
allknow
and
allpow
or
unless
he
doesnt
take
the
person
interest
in
everyday
affair
that
you
claim
and
the
israelit
knew
thi
and
still
some
of
them
chose
to
disobey
and
were
destroy
were
these
peopl
kind
and
love
themselv
not
relev
the
claim
of
kind
and
loving
wa
made
by
you
in
refer
to
your
god
the
natur
of
hi
creationsvictim
is
not
at
issu
god
gave
them
everi
break
he
could
but
in
the
end
he
realli
had
no
choic
in
the
matter
i
see
an
allknow
god
who
did
not
know
what
the
ultim
outcom
would
be
and
an
allpow
god
who
had
no
choic
in
the
matter
mindmush
see
a
how
we
were
fail
to
achiev
salvat
on
our
own
he
sent
hi
son
to
die
for
u
to
be
the
ultim
sin
offer
did
i
miss
someth
did
you
give
some
indic
at
to
whi
a
kind
and
love
god
should
requir
sadist
human
sacrific
to
allow
hi
own
botch
creation
to
achiev
salvat
is
the
fact
the
he
no
longer
doe
thi
an
admiss
on
hi
part
of
have
made
a
mistak
he
sent
hi
son
a
a
consol
to
u
out
of
love
i
note
that
your
answer
physic
follow
my
question
but
i
fail
to
discern
a
connect
between
the
two
by
the
way
for
what
am
i
be
consol
now
that
we
are
live
in
the
age
of
grace
doe
thi
mean
that
for
our
sin
god
now
damn
u
to
etern
hell
after
we
die
rather
than
kill
u
immedi
if
so
is
thi
etern
damnat
an
exampl
of
a
kind
and
love
god
hey
let
be
fair
for
a
moment
here
kind
and
love
doe
not
mean
a
free
ride
whi
not
by
the
way
i
note
for
the
record
that
you
didnt
answer
the
question
there
is
an
amount
of
give
and
take
a
in
ani
relationship
parent
are
suppos
to
be
kind
and
love
but
doe
that
mean
that
child
can
do
whatev
they
want
not
part
of
be
a
parent
mean
administ
punish
when
the
child
is
at
fault
death
andor
etern
damnat
is
your
idea
of
correct
punish
i
hope
you
arent
a
parent
part
of
be
a
parent
mean
give
instruct
god
test
u
through
the
trial
of
life
such
that
we
may
grow
stronger
he
teach
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
thi
is
quit
an
elabor
fantasi
that
youv
construct
but
sadli
it
lack
a
basi
in
realiti
it
also
doe
not
address
the
question
that
i
rais
the
consequ
of
our
action
are
made
clear
to
u
be
it
heaven
or
be
it
hell
if
god
did
not
follow
through
with
what
he
ha
warn
u
about
he
would
not
be
a
veri
good
parent
the
god
that
you
describ
is
not
a
good
parent
but
a
tyrant
in
parent
if
a
parent
issu
a
warn
but
doe
not
follow
through
with
it
the
child
will
not
take
that
parent
word
veri
serious
god
doe
the
same
by
tell
u
who
have
ear
to
hear
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
by
life
trial
we
see
the
folli
of
do
our
own
will
rather
than
hi
he
warn
u
about
the
consequ
of
reject
him
when
it
come
time
for
judgement
sorri
wa
that
the
god
of
the
bibl
whose
rule
i
am
to
follow
or
the
god
of
the
koran
the
veda
the
book
of
koresh
oh
ye
it
all
so
clear
do
we
follow
him
i
will
bulli
for
you
