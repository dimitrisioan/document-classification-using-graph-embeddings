for
myself
i
do
not
need
you
to
show
me
what
you
think
is
the
way
i
have
observ
too
mani
error
in
your
think
alreadi
to
trust
you
to
make
up
the
rule
for
me
becaus
i
set
the
standard
for
my
own
moral
and
i
permit
you
to
do
the
same
for
yourself
i
also
do
not
tri
to
forc
you
to
accept
my
rule
becaus
simpli
becaus
you
dont
like
what
other
peopl
are
do
doesnt
give
you
the
right
to
stop
it
hudson
we
are
all
awar
that
you
would
like
for
everyon
to
be
like
you
howev
it
is
obnoxi
arrog
think
like
your
the
iknowimmorallyrightsoicanforceitony
bullshit
that
ha
brought
u
religi
war
pogrom
against
jew
gaybash
and
other
atroc
by
other
peopl
who
like
you
knew
they
were
moral
right
me
what
is
it
with
you
hudson
you
think
you
know
better
than
other
peopl
so
you
want
to
be
abl
to
tell
them
what
they
can
and
can
not
do
to
themselv
who
die
and
made
you
god
how
come
i
cant
do
the
same
thing
hudson
arent
you
arent
you
indic
that
i
should
not
tell
other
peopl
what
to
do
arent
you
tell
me
it
is
wrong
for
me
to
do
that
it
is
not
a
moral
standard
that
i
am
present
you
with
hudson
it
is
a
key
to
get
along
in
life
with
other
peopl
it
is
also
a
point
of
respect
i
trust
other
peopl
to
be
intellig
enough
to
make
their
own
choic
and
i
expect
the
same
to
be
return
you
on
the
other
hand
do
not
trust
them
and
want
to
make
the
choic
for
themwheth
they
like
it
or
not
it
is
also
a
way
to
avoid
an
inconsist
if
you
believ
that
you
have
the
right
to
set
moral
standard
for
other
and
interfer
in
their
live
then
you
must
by
logic
admit
that
other
peopl
have
the
same
right
of
interfer
in
your
life
ye
i
know
you
will
say
that
your
religion
is
correct
and
tell
you
that
onli
agent
act
in
behalf
of
your
religion
have
the
right
of
interfer
howev
other
peopl
will
say
that
you
have
misinterpret
the
word
of
god
and
that
they
are
the
actual
true
believ
and
that
you
are
act
on
your
own
author
and
so
it
goe
hudson
who
gave
you
the
author
to
set
such
a
moral
standard
for
me
to
tell
me
that
i
can
not
set
a
moral
standard
for
other
you
can
set
all
the
standard
that
you
want
actual
but
dont
be
surpris
if
peopl
dont
follow
you
like
rat
after
the
pie
piper
at
the
most
basic
form
i
am
not
go
to
let
you
tell
me
what
to
do
and
if
necessari
i
will
beat
you
to
a
bloodi
pulp
befor
i
let
you
actual
interfer
in
my
life
now
at
a
more
human
level
than
that
i
recogn
that
all
peopl
are
sentient
be
posse
of
intellig
and
capabl
of
reason
i
also
recogn
that
they
like
i
appreci
be
treat
with
respect
and
allow
to
make
their
own
decis
