unless

it
you
are
just

involv
in
a
debat
where
we
have
variou
opinion
and
each
entiti
ha
it
own
frame
where
the
opinion
is
express
i
think
i
dont
need
to
state
the
dread
rword
so
it
sometim
correct
to
say
that
moral
is
object
or
what
after
all
i
could
hardli
be
wrong
without
drag
in
the
oword
for
your
part
when
you
say
that
relativ
is
true
that
just
your
opinion
whi
do
folk
get

then
if
a
belief
in
relativ
is
mere
a
matter
of
tast
to
be
fair

get
the
impress
that
becaus
