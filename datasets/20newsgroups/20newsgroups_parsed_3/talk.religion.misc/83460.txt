perhap
it

six

might
appli

that
these

do
not
mean
the
same
thing
in
my
mind
to
say
that
scienc
ha
it
basi
in
valu
is
a
bit
of
a
reach
scienc
ha
it
basi
in
observ
fact
even
the
usag
of
the
word
valu
abov
do
not
denot
observ
fact
but
rather
a
standard
of
measur
i
would
conclud
that
scienc
doe
not
have
it
basi
in
valu
and
so
your
statement
abov
fail
in
fact
if
one
conclud
that
a
scientif
set
of
measur
valu
are
base
on
system
deriv
from
observ
then
it
must
follow
that
in
a
scientif
context
there
is
no
such
thing
a
there
is
no
such
thing
a
object
valu
back
to
the
present
thi
ha
noth
to
do
with
a
moral
system
anyhow
just
becaus
the
word
valu
is
use
in
both
context
doe
not
mean
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
two
context
if
one
is
to
argu
for
object
valu
in
a
moral
sens
then
one
must
first
start
by
demonstr
that
moral
itself
is
object
consid
the
mean
of
the
word
object
i
doubt
that
thi
will
ever
happen
so
back
to
the
origin
question
and
object
moral
is
if
you
can
provid
an
object
foundat
for
moral
then
that
will
be
a
good
