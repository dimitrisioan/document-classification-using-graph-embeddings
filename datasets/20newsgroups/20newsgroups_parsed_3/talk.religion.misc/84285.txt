koresh
sermon
doesnt
bother
me
it
probabl
that
a

review
of
what
stephen
ha
done
with
obviou
expenditur

would
provid
addit
insight
into
david

whether

not
we
agre
with
variou
point
of

therein
a
review
would
like
provid
signific
insight
into
our
own
love
for

one
thing
that
seem
appar
from
even
a
cursori
read
of
koresh
messag
is
that
he
wa
not
the

wa
quit
possibl
the
friendli

person
hi

report
him
to
be
someon
state
that
the
davidian
cult
should
not
be
associ
with

well
i
read
all
those
four
post
and
im
now
even
more
convinc
that
davididian

but
sometim
it
make
sens
to
