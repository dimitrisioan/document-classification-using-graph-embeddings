what
a

then
it
goe
on
to
say
that
a
long
a
you
believ
your
sin
will
be
forgiven
to
be
a
christian
is
to
model
oneself
after
jesu
christ
a
impli
by
the
veri
name
christian
if
you
say
you
believ
in
your
head
but
do
not
feel
in
your
heart
what
doe
that
say
of
your
belief
white
supremisist
and
neonazi
may
not
be
your
brand
of
christian
but
by
believ
in
christ
they
are
christian
white
supremist
and
neonazi
are
not
ani
brand
of
christian
if
you
hate
your
whom
you
can
see
then
how
can
you
love
god
whom
you
can
not
see
what
doe
thi
belief
entail
believ
in
christ
and
have
your
sin
forgiven
in
hi
name
doe
not
give
a
christian
a
free
licenc
to
sin
to
repent
of
a
sin
is
to
ask
forgiv
of
that
sin
and
tri
not
to
do
it
again
i
am
a
christian
but
if
you
lump
me
in
with
racist
and
accus
me
of
be
such
then
are
you
not
prejudg
me
btw
i
am
of
chine
racial
background
and
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
part
of
a
visibl
minor
in
thi
countri
i
dont
think
that
i
would
be
favour
look
upon
by
these
white
supremist
christian
a
you
call
them
anyon
can
say
what
they
believ
but
if
they
dont
practic
what
they
preach
then
their
belief
is
fals
do
you
concur
now
for
your
origin
statement
what
bother
me
most
is
whi
peopl
who
have
no
religi
affili
continu
to
persecut
jew
whi
thi
hatr
of
jew
the
major
of
peopl
who
persecut
jew
are
not
christian
i
cant
speak
for
all
christian
and
there
are
bound
to
be
a
few
who
are
on
the
antisemit
bandwagon
you
impli
here
that
it
is
predomin
atheist
and
agnost
who
persecut
jew
i
am
hard
press
to
think
of
even
an
exampl
of
jewish
persecut
in
the
hand
of
atheistsagnost
nazi
and
racist
in
gener
are
the
one
that
come
to
my
immedi
attent
what
i
believ
is
that
such
peopl
may
be
use
the
bibl
to
mask
their
racial
intoler
and
bigotri
they
can
do
a
they
do
and
hide
behind
christian
but
i
tell
you
that
jesu
would
have
noth
to
do
with
them
about
the
onli
one
that
come
to
mind
would
be
in
the
former
soviet
union
where
mani
religi
peopl
suffer
some
sort
of
persecut
not
to
mention
mani
atheistagnost
who
suffer
persecut
for
believ
the
govern
suck
no
arguement
there
rob
lanphier
the
onli
point
im
tri
to
make
is
that
those
who
call
themselv
christian
may
not
be
christian
i
ask
that
you
draw
your
own
conclus
by
what
they
do
and
what
they
say
if
they
are
not
model
after
the
exampl
of
jesu
christ
then
they
are
not
christian
if
they
have
not
repent
of
their
sin
and
accept
jesu
christ
a
their
person
lord
and
saviour
then
they
are
not
christian
these
are
the
onli
criterion
to
be
a
christian
may
god
be
with
you
