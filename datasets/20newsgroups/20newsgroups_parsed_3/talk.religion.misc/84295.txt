if
i
make
a
statement
that
god
exist
love
me
etc
but
in
no
way
insist
that
you
believ
it
doe
that
place
a
burden
of
proof
upon
me
if
you
insist
that
god
doesnt
exist
doe
that
place
a
burden
of
proof
upon
you
i
give
no
proof
i
onli
give
testimoni
to
my
belief
i
will
respond
to
proof
that
you
attempt
to
disprov
my
belief
if
you
say
x
statement
and
give
it
the
author
of
fact
i
will
respond
by
ask
you
whi
you
arent
oblig
to
say
anyth
but
if
your
intent
is
to
convinc
me
that
x
statement
is
true
then
ye
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
you
if
what
wa
be
discus
could
be
establish
or
disproven
by
experi
and
observ
then
i
would
agre
with
you
chri
the
burden
of
proof
would
belong
to
bill
but
the
sourc
document
for
christian
the
bibl
simpli
assum
god
exist
and
make
it
clear
to
u
calvinist
anyway
that
when
a
person
is
in
fellowship
with
god
it
is
becaus
god
ha
taken
the
initi
in
reveal
himself
to
that
person
so
from
a
christian
point
of
view
the
burden
of
proof
belong
to
god
bill
is
be
consist
with
what
the
bibl
teach
in
relat
hi
own
experi
with
god
but
it
would
be
an
error
on
hi
part
to
assum
that
there
is
a
direct
causal
relationship
between
hi
testimoni
and
someon
el
becom
convinc
that
god
exist
and
that
he
need
to
be
reconcil
to
god
if
you
are
mere
give
testimoni
to
your
belief
then
you
are
an
egotist
plea
excus
me
if
i
miss
an
earlier
part
of
thi
thread
in
which
bill
came
across
like
an
egotist
what
i
saw
wa
simpli
obedi
to
the
scriptur
command
to
alway
be
readi
to
give
a
reason
for
the
joy
that
is
in
you
