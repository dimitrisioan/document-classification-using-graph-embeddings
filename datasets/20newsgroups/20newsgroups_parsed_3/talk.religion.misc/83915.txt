re
christian
metaeth
i
wrote
and
who
is
to
say
that
thi
interpret
is
twist
there
are
mani
passag
in
the
bibl
that
in
their
most
straightforward
read
show
the
christian
god
behav
in
just
thi
way
in
articl
dave
davi
write
thi
requir
the
assumpt
that
all
interpret
are
equal
valid
that
there
is
no
way
of
reason
distinguish
among
them
i
wouldnt
make
that
assumpt
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reason
assumpt
no
it
follow
from
the
fact
that
most
christian
choic
of
interpret
stem
from
a
mix
of
belief
that
are
influenc
by
the
secular
ethic
of
their
cultur
and
that
are
not
fulli
determin
by
scriptur
whether
or
not
there
is
some
right
interpret
matter
not
few
christian
claim
the
abil
to
read
the
mind
of
their
god
dave
davi
should
note
that
it
wa
michael
who
first
state
the
import
of
secular
and
cultur
influenc
in
thi
thread
i
think
michael
is
right
in
thi
but
regardless
it
should
be
note
that
thi
ha
not
been
a
point
of
content
between
michael
and
myself
i
have
argu
beyond
michael
claim
that
the
christian
scriptur
are
open
to
so
mani
interpret
includ
a
wide
diverg
within
the
christian
tradit
that
even
their
most
import
theme
are
vagu
again
it
doe
not
matter
that
there
is
some
right
interpret
unless
there
is
a
way
to
determin
what
that
right
interpret
is
it
is
the
lack
of
an
object
measur
not
the
presum
lack
of
an
answer
that
put
the
forc
behind
the
line
i
argu
michael
and
i
and
other
read
the
bibl
with
christian
glass
among
the
thing
that
thi
should
impli
is
that
the
nt
inform
the
ot
even
to
the
point
of
domin
it
some
point
in
the
ot
ceremoni
dietari
law
are
explicitli
abrog
by
the
nt
text
there
are
enough
christian
glass
vari
over
a
suffici
broad
rang
of
color
that
i
can
find
a
few
that
support
my
exampl
no
michael
the
conserv
christian
also
take
the
gospel
serious
what
differenti
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
russel
turpin
no
here
is
misplac
not
to
say
inappropri
michael
selfdescript
must
govern
the
equat
of
radic
liber
which
seem
impli
by
russel
turpin
is
wrong
in
my
opinion
what
make
michael
radic
is
that
he
fulli
acknowledg
that
christian
scriptur
and
tradit
fail
to
determin
the
doctrin
that
so
mani
branch
within
christian
hold
dear
he
is
will
to
live
and
practic
hi
religion
within
thi
indeterminaci
and
he
is
will
to
acknowledg
that
much
of
hi
understand
of
thing
christian
is
influenc
by
idea
that
are
not
pure
christian
those
christian
i
have
call
conserv
must
also
interpret
but
they
do
not
recogn
or
at
least
are
unwil
to
admit
the
extent
and
import
of
thi
russel
turpin
in
an
earlier
post
had
said
that
michael
michael
theolog
posit
actual
didnt
tell
him
much
about
christian
dean
simeon
respond
thi
time
gentli
what
do
you
mean
more
direct
perhap
would
have
been
what
could
you
possibl
mean
the
impli
rhetor
effort
to
separ
michael
from
the
tradit
is
a
failur
michael
is
in
the
tradit
if
your
idea
of
the
tradit
doesnt
includ
him
chang
your
idea
of
the
tradit
i
recogn
that
michael
is
part
of
the
tradit
but
what
doe
it
tell
one
about
a
tradit
cover
origen
aquina
jerri
fallwel
and
jess
jackson
that
it
also
includ
michael
siemon
not
veri
much
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principl
that
make
michael
christian
benefici
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
a
benefici
perhap
moreso
without
be
filter
by
christian
interpret
thi
conclus
doe
not
follow
even
in
short
from
the
argument
that
goe
befor
a
surpris
logic
ellipsi
i
think
the
conclus
doe
follow
the
pure
christian
principl
that
michael
ha
are
the
one
he
share
with
other
in
the
christian
tradit
or
that
can
be
deriv
from
christian
scriptur
these
necessarili
vagu
are
not
enough
to
drive
hi
polit
stanc
that
one
should
love
one
neighbor
is
a
pure
christian
principl
that
thi
mean
show
toler
for
homosexu
is
not
a
to
these
polit
stanc
they
are
often
at
odd
with
what
is
commonli
held
in
most
of
current
christendom
and
so
i
suspect
they
could
be
better
press
outsid
it
on
the
other
hand
i
can
well
understand
the
counterpoint
that
these
polit
stanc
becom
most
influenti
when
present
to
those
who
need
them
most
thi
is
a
theolog
statement
worthi
of
barth
dr
turpin
dd
may
wear
the
black
robe
of
geneva
yet
have
bare
surviv
the
effort
to
finish
in

i
doubt
i
will
attempt
a
more
difficult
