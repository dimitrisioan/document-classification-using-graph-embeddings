for
what

a
compound
word
it
come
from
ortho
straight
true
right
and
from
doxa
opinion
doctrin
teach
i
use
orthodox
to
refer
to
right
teach
a
oppos
to
univers
or
cathol
or
foursquar
gospl
i
think
that
the
greek
orthodox
church
would
take
high
offens
at
your
misus
of
the
word
your
version
of
christian
is
neither
mainstream
nor
bibl
deriv
you
make
claim
of
biblecentr
that
are
not
deriv
soley
from
the
bibl
about
sixseven
month
ago
you
claim
that
your
primari
object
to
the
ld
wa
that
our
doctrin
wa
not
biblederiv
and
now
thi
and
other
claim
can
be
shown
are
also
not
bibl
interpet
bibl
right
teach
is
deriv
from
let
god
speak
to
u
through
the
bibl
thi
can
be
from
read
simpl
truth
in
the
scriptur
and
by
use
the
bibl
to
interpret
the
bibl
simpl
truth
oh
for
exampl
ra
who
is
that
hold
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
appar
from
read
the
scriptur
that
are
pertin
luke
record
christ
promis
to
the
repent
thief
who
hung
on
an
adjac
cross
truli
i
say
to
you
today
you
will
be
with
me
in
paradis
but
wa
it
not
until
later
that
christ
rose
from
the
dead
and
ascend
to
heaven
if
christ
himself
wa
not
in
heaven
until
sunday
how
could
the
repent
thief
have
been
there
with
him
the
answer
lie
in
the
locat
of
paradis
when
jesu
die
appar
paradis
wa
not
exalt
to
heaven
until
easter
day
paradis
exalt
to
heaven
paradis
wasnt
equal
to
heaven
and
now
it
is
yet
you
claim
that
peepl
can
not
be
exalt
to
heaven
nicht
wahr
jesu
refer
to
it
in
the
middl
of
the
stori
of
the
rich
man
and
lazaru
a
abraham
bosom
to
which
the
godli
beggar
lazaru
wa
carri
by
the
angel
after
hi
deceas
luke
thu
abraham
bosom
refer
to
the
place
where
the
soul
of
the
redeem
wait
till
the
day
of
christ
resurrect
when
i
read
the
stori
i
found
that
abraham
bosom
wasnt
so
much
a
place
but
somewher
the
rich
man
could
see
and
talk
to
abraham
it
wa
not
yet
lift
to
heaven
but
it
may
well
have
been
a
section
of
hade
hebrew
sheol
reserv
for
believ
who
had
die
in
the
faith
but
would
not
be
admit
into
the
gloriou
presenc
of
god
in
heaven
until
the
price
of
redempt
had
actual
been
paid
on
calvari
or
even
that
none
would
preced
the
presenc
of
jesu
back
to
glori
with
the
father
gee
thi
is
fairli
close
to
what
the
ld
call
spirit
prison
and
what
you
have
call
fals
doctrin
doubtless
it
wa
the
infern
paradis
that
the
soul
of
jesu
and
the
repent
thief
repair
after
they
each
die
on
friday
afternoon
but
on
sunday
after
the
risen
christ
had
first
appear
to
mari
magdalen
john
and
her
two
companion
matthew
presum
he
then
took
up
with
him
to
glori
all
the
inhabit
of
infern
paradis
includ
abraham
lazaru
and
the
repent

thi

is
not

make
such
a
claim
requir
more
evid
than
you
have
given
here
ra
whenev
your
person
interpret
of
biblic
passag
is
ra
challeng
your
onli
respons
seem
to
be
that
one
need
mere
to
ra
look
at
the
bibl
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblic
thing
differ
from
you
i
think
that
thi
character
is
faulti
whenev
my
person
interpret
is
question
i
usual
give
a
reason
ye
and
your
reason
are
in
gener
not
support
by
ani
direct
read
of
the
scriptur
you
have
demonstr
that
you
claim
to
scriptur
proof
need
to
be
crosscheck
the
referenc
that
you
suppli
often
do
not
support
your
postion
if
they
are
read
in
the
context
of
the
scriptur
a
for
those
that
see
thing
differ
plea
put
forward
where
there
is
a
valid
differ
and
we
can
discus
it
i
seem
to
be
see
from
you
the
notion
that
ani
differ
in
how
one
view
the
bibl
is
somehow
legitim
except
or
cours
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrari
view
and
perhap
we
can
have
a
discus
on
that
topic
but
to
decri
someth
that
i
put
forward
without
put
forward
someth
el
to
discus
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
give
credenc
to
other
alleg
view
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simpli
be
contenti
how
about
that
those
who
have
been
in
paradis
and
have
accept
the
gospl
will
be
judg
of
jesu
christ
and
then
return
to
the
presenc
of
god
is
that
somehow
differ
from
your
express
view
that
the
paradis
spoken
of
or
abraham
bosom
ra
are
we
to
simpli
assum
that
you
are
the
onli
one
who
realli
ra
understand
it
if
you
believ
that
someth
that
i
have
drawn
from
scriptur
is
wrong
then
plea
show
me
from
scriptur
where
it
is
wrong
simpli
state
that
there
are
other
view
is
not
a
proof
show
it
to
me
from
scriptur
and
then
we
can
go
on
should
we
go
back
and
discus
your
view
on
