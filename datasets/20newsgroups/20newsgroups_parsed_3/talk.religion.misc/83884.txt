subject
is
it
good
that
jesu
die
brian
ceccarelli
write
brian
kendig
write
if
you
can
explain
to
me
whi
the
death
of
jesu
wa
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
veri
glad
to
hear
it
and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warn
howev
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
argument
befor
and
they
just
dont
convinc
me
ask
jesu
himself
he
himself
said
whi
in
john
it
isnt
a
mysteri
to
anyon
and
there
certainli
is
no
need
for
a
persuas
argument
read
jesu
own
repli
to
your
question
john
most
assuredli
i
say
to
you
unless
a
grain
of
wheat
fall
onto
the
ground
and
dy
it
remain
alon
but
if
it
dy
it
produc
much
grain
he
who
love
hi
life
will
lose
it
and
he
who
hate
hi
life
in
thi
world
will
keep
it
for
etern
life
if
anyon
serf
me
let
him
follow
me
and
where
i
am
there
my
servant
will
be
also
if
anyon
serf
me
him
my
father
will
honor
whi
would
i
want
an
etern
life
if
i
hate
thi
one
if
we
were
creat
by
a
deiti
whi
would
that
deiti
not
wish
u
to
enjoy
what
he
ha
given
u
whi
would
i
want
to
live
forev
the
challeng
in
my
life
is
that
i
will
die
and
that
i
must
give
my
life
the
mean
i
wish
it
to
have
befor
that
happen
my
time
is
here
and
will
someday
pa
i
will
be
content
to
live
on
in
the
memori
of
my
friend
and
onc
they
too
are
dead
then
i
will
no
longer
have
ani
reason
to
exist
in
short
even
if
your
deiti
doe
exist
that
doesnt
automat
mean
that
i
would
worship
it
i
am
content
to
live
my
own
life
and
fend
for
myself
so
when
i
die
i
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
where
i
end
up
it
will
be
becaus
of
my
action
and
my
choic
if
your
god
decid
to
toss
me
into
a
flame
pit
for
thi
then
so
be
it
i
would
much
rather
just
ceas
to
exist
but
if
your
god
want
my
respect
and
my
obedi
then
it
had
better
earn
these
and
if
it
doe
then
they
will
be
veri
strong
and
true
jesu
give
more
reason
in
john
but
one
obviou
reason
whi
jesu
die
and
a
with
everyth
els
it
ha
noth
do
with
hi
punish
wa
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubt
and
believ
john
the
fact
that
jesu
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obviou
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
thi
obviou
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vaniti
jesu
wasnt
the
onli
one
who
rose
from
the
dead
i
think
it
wa
osiri
who
did
the
same
a
well
a
a
few
charact
from
greek
or
nors
legend
if
memori
serf
but
still
whi
would
i
want
to
rise
from
the
dead
whi
do
you
want
to
whi
did
jesu
suffer
in
hi
death
again
ask
jesu
jesu
say
whi
in
john
that
no
mysteri
either
the
world
hate
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclam
of
how
far
we
human
botch
thing
up
and
thu
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
if
your
god
want
to
win
my
devot
then
it
know
what
it
can
do
provid
some
way
for
me
to
believ
without
have
to
resort
to
blind
faith
that
could
be
appli
equal
well
to
ani
religion
and
whi
cant
you
brian
k
accept
thi
how
can
you
the
world
can
not
accept
him
becaus
it
neither
see
him
nor
know
him
john
that
precis
it
i
neither
see
nor
know
zeu
either
nor
odin
shall
i
offer
them
the
same
devot
i
offer
jesu
the
animos
and
the
lack
of
knowledg
that
come
out
in
your
twist
of
robert
daili
vers
is
veri
convinc
testimoni
of
the
truth
of
john
and
youv
got
to
understand
my
pointofview
i
see
christian
spout
bibl
vers
all
the
time
a
if
it
were
some
sort
of
magic
spell
that
will
level
all
opposit
truth
is
it
not
robert
ha
never
demonstr
that
he
actual
understand
what
the
vers
impli
he
just
rattl
them
off
day
by
day
some
brazenli
fli
in
the
face
of
common
sens
and
realiti
and
i
point
these
out
where
i
can
but
even
more
than
that
even
when
christian
do
tri
to
explain
the
vers
in
their
own
word
they
do
so
from
a
christian
point
of
view
which
is
that
everi
human
be
would
want
to
be
a
christian
if
onli
he
or
she
understood
the
christian
messag
properli
and
then
all
strife
and
suffer
on
the
earth
would
end
here
the
problem
with
that
substitut
moslem
or
buddhist
or
satanist
instead
of
christian
and
it
mean
the
same
thing
christan
is
a
veri
nice
belief
set
around
a
veri
nice
book
but
if
you
want
to
make
me
believ
that
it
ha
ani
bear
on
the
real
world
youv
got
some
convinc
to
do
i
pray
and
hope
that
i
do
blurt
out
such
animos
and
lack
of
knowledg
i
am
not
perfect
either
but
regardless
of
that
i
thank
god
that
jesu
reveal
himself
to
me
without
whom
id
also
be
bumbl
about
blindli
though
arrogantli
slander
the
veri
person
who
creat
me
and
who
love
me
and
in
my
opinion
your
bumbl
about
blindli
make
up
entiti
where
there
arent
ani
and
depriv
yourself
of
a
true
understand
and
enjoy
of
your
life
a
long
a
you
keep
your
belief
to
yourself
ill
keep
my
belief
to
myself
but
a
soon
a
you
start
wave
them
around
expect
me
to
toss
in
my
opinion
too
