question
for
those
with

moral
in

david
bold
write
in

jame
owen
write
you
seem
to
be
say
that
god
be
unknow
hi
moral
is
unknow
yep
that
pretti
much
it
a
i
understand
it
the
sadduce
believ
that
the
torah
wa
all
that
wa
requir
wherea
the
pharise
the
ancestor
of
modern
judaism
believ
that
the
torah
wa
avail
for
interpret
to
lead
to
an
understand
of
the
requir
moral
in
all
it
nuanc
talmud
the
essenc
of
all
of
thi
is
that
biblic
moral
is
an
interfac
between
man
and
yhwh
for
a
jew
or
christian
and
doe
not
necessarili
indic
anyth
about
yhwh
outsid
of
that
relationship
although
one
can
specul
the
point
im
tri
to
make
is
that
we
onli
realli
have
the
bibl
to
interpret
and
that
interpret
is
by
human
i
guess
thi
is
where
faith
or
relev
come
in
with
all
it
inher
subject
god
be
unknow
i
cant
comment
on
hi
motif
but
it
would
be
distress
if
he
allow
u
to
misunderstand
him
through
no
fault
of
our
own
for
saniti
sake
we
must
assum
if
we
believ
in
him
at
all
that
hi
messag
come
through
somehow
the
question
is
whether
it
come
through
immedi
to
everi
individu
or
is
contain
in
a
complex
canon
that
must
be
interpret
by
expert
in
consult
with
one
anoth
or
is
transmit
directli
through
appoint
repres
who
are
free
to
interpret
extend
and
modifi
the
canon
if
god
messag
is
inde
mediat
the
further
problem
aris
a
to
whether
the
individu
under
stand
the
mediat
messag
fulli
and
clearli
sinc
the
respons
for
understand
lie
ultim
with
the
individu
we
must
assum
that
god
in
hi
benevol
guid
each
individu
to
the
appropri
sourc
for
that
individu
whereof
the
person
may
or
may
not
drink
metaphys
if
there
are
multipl
moral
code
then
there
is
no
absolut
moral
code
and
i
think
thi
is
theolog
question
no
there
may
be
an
absolut
moral
code
there
are
undoubt
multipl
moral
code
the
multipl
moral
code
may
be
found
in
the
absolut
moral
code
a
an
exampl
a
parent
may
tell
a
child
never
to
swear
and
the
child
may
assum
that
the
parent
never
swear
simpli
becaus
the
parent
ha
told
the
child
that
it
is
wrong
now
the
parent
may
swear
like
a
trooper
in
the
pub
or
bar
where
there
are
no
child
the
wrong
here
is
if
the
child
disobey
the
parent
the
parent
may
feel
that
it
is
inappropri
to
swear
in
front
of
child
but
may
be
quit
happi
to
swear
in
front
of
anim
the
analog
doe
not
quit
hold
water
becaus
the
child
know
that
he
is
of
the
same
type
a
the
parent
and
may
be
a
parent
later
in
life
but
you
get
the
gist
of
it
incident
the
young
child
consid
the
direct
a
absolut
until
he
get
older
see
piaget
and
learn
a
moral
of
hi
own
your
exampl
is
complic
in
our
age
by
the
thin
line
between
moral
and
polit
you
might
have
said
burp
for
burp
and
swear
carri
about
the
same
stigma
today
if
you
are
talk
about
take
the
lord
name
in
vain
a
a
seriou
transgress
then
thi
exampl
is
more
a
case
of
hypocrisi
than
of
vari
moral
code
if
there
is
an
absolut
moral
code
proposit
or
law
in
that
code
appli
absolut
and
univers
by
definit
conceiv
some
moral
code
could
be
subset
of
the
univers
code
a
you
say
at
the
outset
so
for
exampl
god
code
could
includ
thou
shalt
not
creat
be
without
a
hospit
planet
to
live
on
but
thi
law
would
be
inapplic
to
u
nevertheless
we
would
be
entitl
to
suppos
that
all
law
applic
to
u
are
also
applic
to
god
but
when
you
begin
to
ask
what
law
might
appear
in
god
moral
code
you
have
a
sens
of
the
absurd
of
the
question
doe
god
make
law
for
himself
to
follow
perhap
god
is
not
the
