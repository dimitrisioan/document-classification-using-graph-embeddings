re
who
next
mormon
and
jew
in
articl
gerri
roston
write
no
a
noknock
warrant
is
in
clear
violat
of
the
th
amend
okay
what
about
the
fact
that
they
were
tip
off
they
shouldnt
have
open
fire
right
wrong
think
about
thi
i
am
a
drug
dealer
and
my
competit
want
to
do
away
with
me
they
call
me
and
tell
me
that
the
fed
are
on
their
way
with
a
noknock
warrant
so
be
moron
sheep
we
wait
with
our
gun
holster
now
instead
of
the
fed
in
come
my
competit
and
were
histori
the
onli
accept
answer
to
a
noknock
warrant
is
blaze
gun
i
may
sound
paranoid
but
our
govern
is
out
of
control
and
kill
a
few
feder
offic
make
knock
some
sen
back
into
it
hmm
the
polic
strategi
of
burst
in
with
weapon
drawn
clearli
mark
a
offic
and
yell
polic
repeatedli
thi
is
use
everi
day
to
bust
drug
hous
the
idea
is
to
awe
the
suspect
into
submiss
with
surpris
and
display
of
firepower
in
order
to
avoid
a
gun
fight
a
for
not
knock
it
a
sad
necess
in
mani
case
sinc
the
suspect
will
attempt
to
escap
or
even
fight
usual
thi
strategi
work
if
it
didnt
then
it
wouldnt
be
use
so
commonli
now
would
it
whether
or
not
it
wa
appropri
to
use
thi
strategi
on
the
bd
is
not
my
point
sinc
i
dont
think
ani
of
u
have
enough
inform
to
make
a
clear
judgement
on
thi
issu
i
mere
point
out
that
it
is
a
valid
strategi
which
is
use
everi
day
furthermor
we
dont
know
of
ani
substitut
strategi
capabl
of
apprehend
potenti
danger
and
arm
suspect
do
you
suggest
that
the
polic
alway
knock
with
gun
holster
and
never
arrest
ani
suspect
until
they
have
been
allow
to
inspect
the
officer
badg
just
what
should
the
polic
do
when
apprehend
potenti
danger
and
arm
suspect
how
far
can
they
reason
go
to
identiy
themselv
what
do
you
suggest
they
can
do
which
cant
be
fake
by
the
competit
even
if
youv
got
deadli
enemi
who
may
pretend
to
be
cop
that
not
an
excus
to
murder
polic
in
the
case
of
the
bd
there
wa
almost
definit
at
most
the
paranoid
delus
of
