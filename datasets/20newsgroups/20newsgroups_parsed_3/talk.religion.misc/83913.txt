which
wa
found
in

piec
of
paper

i
at
that
point
wa
becaus

in
front
of
peopl
but
the
other
guy
read
too
and
he
wa
use
to
hold

i
could
tell
the
first

mystic
christian
order
and
that
they
base
their
teach
on

thirteenth
centuri
the
other
guy
took
over
read
from
hi
piec
of
paper
in
a
fairytal
teller
voic
what
he
said
sound
like
a
load
of
crap
to
me
of
cours
that
might
be
becaus
i
am
unenlighten
or
someth
what
made
me
a
bit
suspici
wa
the
way
they
first
said
that
we
all
contain
someth
divin
and
could
find
our
way
back
to
divin
then
that
we
couldnt
becom
divin
a
the
person
we
are
current
but
if
we
work
realli
hard
we
would
reach
etern
bliss
mayb
ive
read
too
much
raw
but
it
sound
veri
much
like
the
thing
he
talk
about
in
the
chapter
how
to
robot
peopl
and
brainwash
your
friend
in
prometheu
rise
it
wa
veri
interest
to
watch
the
two
rosicrucian
the
one
hold
the
actual
lectur
obvious
wa
top
dog
and
the
other
one
seem
to
be
a
true
believ
i
got
the
impress
that
the
top
dog
had
more
distanc
to
the
faith
than
the
true
believ
that
he
use
it
to
gain
power
and
admir
he
spoke
like
a
fairytal
teller
whenev
he
rememb
