brian

brian
kendig
prove
thi
veri
sad
fact
by
the
absurd
thing
he
say
for
exampl
if
i
get
through
into
the
firey
pit
i
will
ceas
to
exist
the
bibl
doesnt
say
that
he
hasnt
a
clue
even
to
what
jesu
said
about
hell
that
is
but
one
exampl
look
at
your
discus
i
would
say
that
you
both
oper
from
your
own
refer
frame
there
no
insid

no
outsid
there
are
just
two
polar
view
a
for

insid
the

thing
are
still
not
that
clear
we
dont
have

one
of
the
few
book
that
actual
talk
about
satan
job
is
veri
much
out
of
line
with
the
rest
of

now
in
your

realitythat
is
a
differ
matter
and
to
you
and
to
brian
rel
doe
play
a
big
role
what
we
perceiv
to
be
true
depend
on
our
vantag
point
sinc
i
have
read
the
bibl
and
brian
kendig
show
that
he
hasnt
he
ha
a
narrow
perspect
than
mine
at
least
in
the
respect
of
knowledg
of
the
bibl
i
am
propos
to
brian
brian
come
up
here
and
take
a
look
from
thi
vantag
point
but
brian
repli
i
rather
not
thank
you
i
am
content
where
i

brian
ignor
the
fact
that
he

he
realiz
i
had
share
the
