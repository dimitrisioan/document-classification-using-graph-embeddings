im
seriou
youv
explain

to

which
i
never

just
for

suppos
we
almost
all
agre
that
we
are
in
a
set
of

call
realiti
what
then
then
we
all
live
happili
ever
after
serious
if
we
all
agre
on

circumst
were
in
i
suspect
wed
all
agre
on
the
best
cours
of
action
unfortun
i
have
no
confid
that
such
a
situat
will
ever
aris
some
of
u
think
there
a
big
god
in
the
sky
some
dont
some
think
theyv
been
chosen
by

other
disagre
some
think
they
are
infal
other
think
otherwis
until
those
disagr
over
circumst
can
be
iron
out
there
littl
hope
of
everyon
agre
or
say
for
all
practic
intent
and
purpos
there
is
no
frame
of
refer
in
which
thu
and
such
is
good
isnt
that
approxim
object
in
the
same
way
that
we
usual
expect
a
speed
bullet
to
outrun
a
snail
ye
i
think
that
for
exampl
onli
a
vanishingli
small
number
of
peopl
would
hold
that
there
a
frame
of
refer
in
which
gass
six
million
jew
is
good
so
that
probabl
about
a
close
to
an
object
moral
valu
a
ive
encount
in
my
life
so
far
for
exampl
if
we
hear
of
a
bomb
in
a
crowd
area
isnt
it
a
rather
sensibl
first
guess
that
thi
is
an
immor
act
even
though
there
conceiv
might
be
some
tailend
case
that
would
justifi
it
well
i
think
your
exampl
poor
if
the
bomb
in
iraq
for
exampl
and
wa
drop
by
an
american
plane
mani
peopl
would
hold
that
it
wa
a
moral
act
and
what
weasel
word
do
you
use
to
describ
that
frame
of
refer
if
it
isnt
an
object
realiti
for
valu
im
sorri
i
cant
pars
an
object
realiti
for
valu
could
you
tr
y
again
san
object
realiti
for
valuessom
valu
are
real
even
in
the
face
of
disagr
i
still
dont
quit
see
what
your
tri
to
say
i
assum
by
valu
you
mean
moral
valu
ye
in
which
case
what
do
you
mean
by
real
what
is
a
real
moral
valu
a
oppos
to
an
unreal
one
i
mean
to
say
that
valu
are
a
real
a
hors
whatev
you
understand
by
a
hors
be
real
is
pretti
much
what
i
mean
about
a
valu
be
real
hmm
so
these
moral
valu
have
a
percept
physic
presenc
if
you
are
say
that
some
moral
system
are
better
than
other
in
your
opinion
then
all
you
get
is
infinit
regress
sorri
but
in
what
way
is
it
an
infinit
regress
it
look
extrem
finit
to
me
i
meant
that
it
never
more
than
your
opinion
right
and
the
chain
end
right
there
the
buck
stop
with
me
it
not
an
infinit
regress
youv
clarifi
thi
for
me
abov
my
understand
is
now
that
if
a
supermajor
of
relativist
agre
that
thu
and
such
is
wrong
in
almost
ani
or
all
frame
of
refer
then
theyr
say
someth
which
is
to
all
practic
intent
and
purpos
no
differ
than
what
im
say
right
the
key
point
howev
is
that
there
are
vanishingli
few
of
these
moral
issu
where
we
can
get
of
peopl
to
agre
on
the
outcom
for
all
frame
of
refer
and
agre
on
the
frame
of
refer
what
you
do
not
get
is
ani
justif
for
say
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peac
sorri
but
that
not
so
i
can
provid
a
justif
for
assert
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peac
i
just
cant
provid
a
justif
which
work
in
all
possibl
circumst
logic
possibl
or
actual
possibl
i
cant
manag
either
kill
hitler
use
a
car
bomb
would
have
been
a
terrorist
act
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
couldnt
exactli
condemn
it
although
there
are
tricki
philosoph
issu
to
do
with
hindsight
by
which
i
mean
are
you
stretch
possibl
to
includ
event
such
a
the
atom
in
my
termin
switch
place
so
that
the
termin
turn
upsid
down
or
do
you
think
it
like
that
circumst
will
aris
in
which
terror
is
superior
to
peac
i
think
that
circumst
have
alreadi
arisen
where

would
have
been
better
