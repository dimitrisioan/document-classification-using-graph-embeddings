again
you
miss
jesu
point
if
you
read
the
surround
passag
you
would
understand
what
jesu
mean
by
life
in
the
world
but
a
is
you
bumbl
around
assert
your
standard
axiom
that
the
bibl
is
bunk
and
came
up
with
the
wrong
idea
also
you
do
not
know
exactli
what
jesu
mean
by
etern
life
brian
k
do
you
expect
to
jump
in
the
middl
of
the
quantum
mechan
book
and
understand
hermit
polynomi
have
not
read
the
surround
materi
whi
do
you
such
with
the
bibl
for
an
idea
what
jesu
mean
by
the
world
look
up
refer
to
it
in
your
concord
for
a
good
descript
the
whole
book
of
ecclesiast
is
game
for
etern
life
check
out
john
john
you
will
find
that
etern
life
is
quit
differ
than
what
you
think
etern
life
start
nowan
infinit
high
qualiti
of
life
live
in
fellowship
with
god
in
short
even
if
your
deiti
doe
exist
that
doesnt
automat
mean
that
i
would
worship
it
i
am
content
to
live
my
own
life
and
fend
for
myself
so
when
i
die
i
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
where
i
end
up
it
will
be
becaus
of
my
action
and
my
choic
if
your
god
decid
to
toss
me
into
a
flame
pit
for
thi
then
so
be
it
i
would
much
rather
just
ceas
to
exist
but
if
your
god
want
my
respect
and
my
obedi
then
it
had
better
earn
these
and
if
it
doe
then
they
will
be
veri
strong
and
true
if
my
dieti
exist
you
would
not
just
ceas
to
exist
jesu
talk
of
hell
in
luke
youv
got
to
understand
my
pointofview
i
see
christian
spout
bibl
vers
all
the
time
a
if
it
were
some
sort
of
magic
spell
that
will
level
all
opposit
truth
is
it
not
robert
ha
never
demonstr
that
he
actual
understand
what
the
vers
impli
he
just
rattl
them
off
day
by
day
some
brazenli
fli
in
the
face
of
common
sens
and
realiti
and
i
point
these
out
where
i
can
the
truth
is
is
that
it
is
not
some
sort
of
magic
spell
the
truth
is
is
that
you
do
not
understand
it
and
enjoy
not
understand
it
christan
is
a
veri
nice
belief
set
around
a
veri
nice
book
wrong
again
christian
is
suppos
to
be
relationship
you
do
not
even
know
what
christian
is
and
you
are
argu
against
it
and
in
my
opinion
your
bumbl
about
blindli
make
up
entiti
where
there
arent
ani
and
depriv
yourself
of
a
true
understand
and
enjoy
of
your
life
a
long
a
you
keep
your
belief
to
yourself
ill
keep
my
belief
to
myself
but
a
soon
a
you
start
wave
them
around
expect
me
to
toss
in
my
opinion
too
just
a
i
make
up
such
place
a
jericho
jerusalem
babylon
corinth
ephesu
susa
and
such
king
a
nebuchanezzar
david
solomon
sennacherib
herod
pontiu
pilat
but
i
guess
then
that
you
treat
abraham
lincoln
a
a
myth
like
you
do
odin
and
zeu
