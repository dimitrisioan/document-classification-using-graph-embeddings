like
to

what
relativ
conclud
when
two
peopl
grotesqu
disagre
is
it
a
both
are
right
b
one
of
them
is
wrong
and
sometim
though
perhap
rare
we
have
a
pretti
good
idea
who
it
is
c
one
of
them
is
wrong
but
we
never
have
ani
inform
a
to
who
so
we
make
our
best
guess
if
we
realli
must
make
a
decis
d
the
idea
of
a
right
moral
judgement
is
meaningless
impli
that
whether
peac
is
better
than
war
eg
is
a
meaningless
question
and
need
not
be
discus
for
it
ha
no
correct
answer
e
someth
el
a
short
posit
assert
would
be
nice
from
whose
point
of
view
would
you
like
to
know
what
relativ
conclud
one
of
the
peopl
involv
in
the
argument
or
some
third
person
observ
the
arguer
ive
just
come
from
respond
anoth
of
your
post
where
some
penni
have
drop
for
me
but
it
would
clarifi
further
if
you
would
answer
from
the
point
of
view
of
ani
disinterest
observ
perhap
an
observ
a
like
to
be
in
posit
a
a
in
posit
b
where
a
and
b
disagre
in
the
futur
and
have
hi
or
her
conclus
now
bind
on
them
at
that
time
well
if
our
observ
x
is
a
like
to
be
in
a
posit
a
b
and
if
he
agre
that
both
a
and
b
are
make
appropri
observ
and
infer
regard
the
situat
then
i
would
expect
him
to
conclud
that
there
is
no
right
answer
hope
there
would
be
some
other
factor
which
would
allow
him
to
make
some
judgement
regard
which
answer
to
accept
if
on
the
other
hand
he
disagre
with
the
principl
of
either
a
or
b
i
suspect
he
would
make
a
decis
in
favour
of
the
other
one
it
is
unfortun
the
case
that
not
all
moral
argument
have
answer
from
all
perspect
for
instanc
i
am
complet
unabl
to
come
to
ani
conclus
regard
whether
abort
should
be
allow
or
not
from
my
perspect
in
an
ideal
world
all
live
thing
would
have
a
right
to
life
but
in
an
ideal
world
woman
would
have
the
absolut
right
to
do
what
they
like
with
their
own
bodi
clearli
there
is
no
way
to
resolv
in
favour
of
both
these
principl
therefor
i
agre
with
the
compromis
solut
of
allow
abort
up
to
a
certain
time
after
concept
and
decid
on
the
time
base
on
variou
sometim
illdefin
criterion
thi
is
also
a
sensibl
move
i
think
becaus
it
let
peopl
make
their
own
decis
within
reason
and
for
what
it
worth
i
am
reason
happi
with
current
uk
abort
law
similarli
the
situat
in
what
left
of
yugoslavia
is
a
horribl
mess
and
i
realli
cant
see
my
way
to
ani
sort
of
conclus
there
i
dont
even
know
enough
to
imagin
what
sort
of
compromis
one
might
manag
