the

found

you
are
still
labor
under
at
least
misconcept
you
seem
to
believ
that
steel
melt
somewher
around
c
actual
the
melt
point
of
most
iron
alloy
and
steel
are
iron
alloy
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
c
even
if
the
gun
were
found
in
area
which
achiev
the
c
temperatur
the
steel
part
of
the
gun
would
not
be
deform
and
it
would
still
be
trivial
to
identifi
the
natur
of
the
weapon
a
fire
is
not
an
isotherm
process
there
are
hot
spot
and
cold
spot
though
cold
is
pure
a
rel
term
so
the
weapon
wa
not
necessarili
situat
in
a
hot

a
you
seem
to
impli

even
if
it
