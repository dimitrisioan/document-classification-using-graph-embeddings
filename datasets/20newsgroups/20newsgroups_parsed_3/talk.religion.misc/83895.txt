write
hi
all
im
go
to
tri
to
do
someth
here
that
perhap
mani
would
not
have
thought
even
possibl
i
want
to
begin
the
process
of
initi
a
literari
critic
studi
of
the
pornographi
post
on
altsexstori
to
identifi
the
major
theme
and
motif
present
in
the
stori
post
there
open
up
then
the
possibl
of
an
object
moral
evalu
of
the
materi
present
there
first
off
let
me
congratul
you
for
not
post
a
flame
about
you
sick
pervert
you
are
immor
you
are
all
go
to
hell
which
seem
to
be
the
usual
religi
post
found
on
the
altsex
hierarchi
hope
you
wont
get
flame
either
you
will
howev
be
argu
with
i
person
think
that
your
project
is
built
on
unsteadi
ground
first
i
do
not
believ
that
there
is
ani
way
to
find
an
object
moral
moral
and
valu
are
inher
subject
they
repres
the
belief
of
a
person
or
a
group
of
peopl
they
can
be
wide
held
perhap
even
overwhelmingli
held
but
they
are
never
and
can
never
be
object
assumpt
a
christian
bedrock
assumpt
that
all
that
is
true
come
truli
from
god
regard
altsexstori
while
perhap
even
from
an
object
standpoint
the
major
of
it
materi
is
inde
repugn
you
come
to
thi
conclus
quit
quickli
when
you
start
think
about
analyz
it
materi
like
thi
some
of
it
reflect
some
fairli
profound
need
in
peopl
a
well
a
some
truth
and
deserv
to
be
point
out
second
i
do
not
accept
the
assumpt
that
you
make
here
if
a
you
say
you
are
tri
to
be
object
then
whi
accept
a
moral
to
begin
with
by
use
the
christian
bibl
your
defeat
your
own
purpos
by
do
so
in
the
long
run
the
advantag
of
make
such
a
literarymor
analysi
is
that
it
will
save
bandwidth
between
christian
and
non
mutual
flame
each
other
about
the
moral
accept
of
the
stuff
on
these
pornograph
group
third
call
me
a
pessimist
but
you
wont
stop
the
flamag
there
will
alway
be
peopl
who
pop
upin
altsex
to
tell
u
how
sick
and
twist
and
evil
we
all
are
just
out
of
curio
do
altsex
reader
show
up
unprovok
in
the
religion
group
to
tell
you
all
that
you
are
narrowmind
censor
overbear
totalitarianist
basic
there
should
not
be
a
disson
between
a
christian
moral
and
a
nonchristian
one
either
there
is
valu
in
a
particular
work
or
there
is
not
whether
one
is
a
christian
or
not
hm
let
me
provid
an
exampl
four
peopl
get
togeth
over
dinner
to
discus
moral
you
me
a
rather
conserv
moslem
and
a
sociopath
i
start
off
by
say
that
i
think
it
immor
to
forc
peopl
to
have
sex
with
you
you
agre
but
also
say
that
it
is
immor
to
have
sex
with
someon
of
your
own
gender
just
a
note
i
realli
dont
know
your
view
on
homosexu
i
am
just
use
thi
a
a
common
view
of
moral
for
the
purpos
of
thi
exampl
the
moslem
say
that
it
is
immor
for
woman
to
have
their
face
uncov
the
sociopath
who
ha
becom
bore
kill
all
three
of
u
and
eat
u
but
feel
no
guilt
becaus
he
ha
done
noth
wrong
moral
in
hi
own
mind
in
support
for
the
first
assumpt
the
christian
scriptur
say
thi
evid
delet
im
not
go
to
accept
your
evid
for
thi
you
ask
u
to
accept
the
word
of
god
that
everyth
good
come
from
god
thi
is
onli
a
valid
argument
for
a
person
who
share
your
belief
still
i
must
say
that
catalog
the
major
theme
and
motif
in
erotica
could
be
interest
for
other
reason
than
your
so
good
luck
with
thi
next
part
now
then
what
are
some
of
the
major
themesmotif
in
the
pornograph
literatur
on
place
like
altsexstori
these
are
some
that
ive
been
abl
to
identifi
plea
addcom
on
them
motif
the
malecinderella
in
so
mani
of
the
stori
there
is
express
a
feel
of
alien
and
worthless
on
the
part
of
the
writer
or
otherwis
protagonist
of
the
stori
with
regard
to
the
object
the
other
person
of
hisher
desir
often
a
stori
involv
a
protagonist
who
on
the
surfac
is
quit
averag
but
underneath
usual
ha
an
enorm
dick
who
desir
to
in
some
way
to
gain
access
in
a
definit
sexual
way
to
the
other
person
who
hesh
confess
is
far
more
desir
than
hesh
is
and
who
inde
seem
to
walk
between
the
raindrop
hmmmdo
i
detect
just
a
wee
bit
of
condesc
here
motif
a
celebr
of
inde
preoccup
with
beauti
not
veri
object
the
vast
major
of
pornograph
literatur
deal
with
beauti
be
it
innoc
somehow
about
to
be
lost
grace
or
simpli
physic
beauti
and
gener
most
peopl
christian
or
non
will
say
that
beauti
is
good
one
could
constru
thi
to
mean
that
beauti
peopl
are
better
or
more
good
than
nonbeauti
peopl
i
would
hope
that
peopl
reliz
that
thi
is
not
necessarili
true
motif
one
dick
is
one
instrument
of
redempt
might
i
suggest
the
word
peni
it
seem
more
in
line
with
the
tone
of
your
post
bless
are
those
who
are
wellhung
for
they
shall
get
laid
from
what
would
thu
be
a
revis
matthew
bravo
i
respect
you
and
your
sen
of
humor
sir
motif
sex
a
an
express
of
sincer
give
there
is
often
enough
a
clear
desir
on
the
part
of
the
protagonist
to
give
definit
sexual
pleasur
to
the
object
person
of
hisher
desir
ye
and
thi
theme
is
usual
what
the
better
stori
are
about
howev
they
are
not
alway
selfish
i
could
point
to
exampl
in
the
work
of
elf
sternberg
for
exampl
motif
altsexstori
describ
a
sex
which
is
complet
remov
from
the
realm
of
transmit
life
so
remov
is
sex
from
it
procr
dimens
on
altsexstori
that
one
begin
to
wonder
whi
sex
even
involv
ejacul
a
in
the
context
describ
in
pornographi
it
serv
then
no
real
purpos
it

the
same
purpos
a
it
doe
in

movi
it
affirm
the

the

a
assur
the
reader
that
he
the

the
whole

is
probabl
veri
well
describ
by
the
cathol
teach
on
thi
of

peopl
who
accept
your
church
in

if
sex
is
for

then
whi
did
god
make
it
pleasur
so
that
peopl
would
want
to
do
it
rather

thi
mean
that
they
have

altsexstori

will
probabl
not

thi

tradit
judeochristian
ha
been
so
neg

a
great
moral
morass
pornographi
would
not
tend
in
those
direct
if
there
were
not
a
demand
for
it
mani
peopl
have
violent
fantasi
that
they
would
never
