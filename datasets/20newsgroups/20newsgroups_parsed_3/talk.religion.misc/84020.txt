what
is
your
beef
against
jesu
first
and
foremost
i
honestli

anyth
more
than
a
man
who
live
and
die
two
thousand
year
ago
i
know
your
bibl
provid
wonder
stori
of
the
thing
he
said
and
did
but
i
simpli
do
not
believ
that
he
still
exist
a
an
entiti
that
ha
ani
bear
on
thi
univers
or
the
life
in
it
and
i
similarli
do
not
believ
that
the
god
that
you
worship
exist
or
ha
ever
exist
period
i
view
religion
in
gener
and
christian
in
specif
a
a
cultur
viru
that
ha
been
pass
down
from
gener
to
gener
becaus
peopl
are
often
too
afraid
to
think
for
themselv
and
claim
respons
for
their
own
fate
so
they
brainwash
themselv
and
their
child
into
believ
the
popular
myth
and
it
go
on
from
there
and
eventu
christian
becom
a
given
if
so
mani
other
peopl
believ
in
it
it
must
be
right
no
i
dont
believ
in
ani
life
after

to
me
to
tri
to
bring
mean
and
purpos
to
my
life
in
the
meantim
i
dont
believ
that
it
a
good
thing
to
humbl
myself
and
view

a
sin
pride

noth
at
all
wrong
with
homosexu
and
noth
inferior
