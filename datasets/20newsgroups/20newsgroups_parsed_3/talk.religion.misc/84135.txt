whi
should
anyon
check
let
restrict
thi
to
christian
whi
do
we
want
to
find
command
in
the
book
regard
a
scriptur
what
go
on
i
will
pa
on
psycholog
answer
whether
dismiss
or
more
open
a
not
the
kind
of
issu
to
deal
with
here
the
question
is
what
is
the
theolog
point
involv
and
it
ha
been
quot
at
me
often
enough
by
those
who
dont
believ
i
take
it
serious
that
jesu
is
said
to
have
said
if
you
love
me
you
will
obey
my
command
john
i
am
like
ani
christian
the
slave
of
christ
and
it
is
my
will
that
i
should
do
a
he
will
me
to
do
i
am
also
or
instead
hi
younger
brother
but
still
under
hi
direct
though
we
both
call
god
abba
christian
therefor
will
tri
to
find
what
it
is
that
their
lord
command
them
and
discov
it
will
feel
oblig
to
do
it
or
to
confess
their
failur
reader
here
may
set
asid
the
theolog
jargon
such
a
slave
of
christ
the
point
is
that
adher
of
a
religion
will
read
the
text
whether
classifi
a
inspir
or
not
that
are
held
up
a
model
in
an
effort
to
find
applic
to
their
own
situat
thi
practic
rang
from
devot
read
of
sermon
and
the
like
to
the
exegesi
of
canon
ical
scriptur
a
the
word
of
god
and
at
the
highest
pitch
thi
lead
to
a
question
of
whether
we
can
find
in
inspir
scriptur
someth
that
can
act
a
absolut
guidanc
for
our
action
the
problem
is
in
find
out
just
what
it
is
our
lord
command
i
am
go
to
set
asid
for
thi
essay
one
major
direct
in
which
christian
have
look
for
these
command
name
christian
tradit
that
is
not
becaus
i
reject
tradit
but
becaus
my
primari
audienc
in
thi
essay
is
protest
who
deni
tradit
a
determin
valu
in
favor
of
the
wit
of
scriptur
the
question
i
want
to
deal
with
is
what
command
can
we
find
from
our
lord
in
scriptur
and
that
turn
out
to
be
a
hard
question
if
ani
of
my
protest
inquisitor
would
like
to
turn
the
discuss
to
the
author
of
tradit
i
can
accomod
them
unlik
most
protest
episcopalian
admit
claim
from
a
scriptur
b
reason
and
c
tradit
on
roughli
equal
stand
earlier
in
john
than
my
quot
abov
we
read
john
i
give
you
a
new
command
love
one
anoth
thi
is
the
onli
place
in
the
nt
where
christian
are
given
an
explicit
command
with
the
context
comment
on
it
imper
mode
pronounc
by
jesu
at
the
same
meal
so
we
reader
infer
sinc
it
is
not
in
john
but
in
the
synopt
jesu
say
take
thi
bread
thi
is
my
bodi
mark
cf
matthew
luke
corinthian
the
mode
is
imper
greek
labet
and
henc
thi
too
is
a
command
in
both
case
we
have
to
infer
that
the
command
is
direct
to
a
wider
circl
than
the
immedi
colloc
of
discipl
becaus
we
judg
the
evangelist
point
in
mention
it
with
the
discipl
by
then
mostli
or
entir
dead
is
that
we
are
expect
to
follow
thi
a
a
command
from
our
lord
in
the
case
of
communion
paul
mention
at
least
thi
is
probabl
true
of
the
evangelist
also
impli
an
ongo
ritual
liturgi
in
which
these
word
oper
to
bind
christian
to
the
origin
command
to
hi
discipl
a
a
continu
command
to
the
christian
commun
i
am
entir
comfort
with
thi
infer
but
i
must
point
out
that
it
is
there
between
u
and
the
occas
on
which
jesu
spoke
the
command
i
take
it
a
a
clear
infer
at
the
veri
least
the
evangelist
notion
that
all
christian
are
call
to
love
one
anoth
in
jesu
command
direct
at
the
discipl
but
i
have
to
call
attent
to
the
infer
the
command
can
not
appli
to
me
without
the
gener
from
the
specif
context
of
it
statement
to
my
own
context
a
a
discipl
of
christ
all
read
of
scriptur
ha
to
make
such
infer
to
get
ani
sens
out
of
the
text
whatsoev
thi
is
a
gener
problem
in
read
these
text
we
can
not
read
them
at
all
without
our
own
understand
of
our
nativ
languag
in
which
we
normal
read
the
translat
text
and
without
some
appreci
of
the
origin
context
and
at
point
the
origin
languag
when
english
mislead
u
i
am
go
to
presum
in
what
follow
that
we
have
the
gener
problem
of
how
to
read
scriptur
under
control
i
dont
realli
think
thi
is
true
but
it
will
suffic
for
my
current
purpos
i
will
address
onli
the
issu
that
aris
when
we
have
alreadi
cope
with
the
understand
of
a
year
old
text
from
anoth
world
than
the
one
we
live
in
question
at
that
level
onli
introduc
more
reser
vation
about
the
command
issu
than
will
be
found
stipul
that
we
can
read
the
text
a
the
origin
audienc
might
have
done
among
the
reason
we
have
for
see
john
agap
allel
a
a
gener
command
not
mere
an
instruct
by
jesu
to
thi
discipl
on
that
one
occas
and
one
link
it
to
the
synopt
great
command
is
that
we
have
critic
from
jesu
about
limit
our
love
to
those
whom
we
congeni
associ
with
in
matthew
ff
we
read
you
have
learnt
how
it
wa
said
you
must
love
your
neighbor
and
hate
your
enemi
but
i
say
to
you
love
your
enemi
in
fact
the
leviticu
context
quot
doe
not
say
hate
your
enemi
it
is
mere
the
common
human
presumpt
and
leviticu
is
at
pain
to
say
that
the
love
should
extend
to
stranger
amongst
the
peopl
of
israel
luke
in
expand
on
thi
same
q
context
go
on
to
have
jesu
say
even
sinner
love
those
who
love
them
all
of
thi
suggest
quit
strongli
id
say
that
limit
the
scope
of
the
new
command
is
not
quit
what
jesu
ha
in
mind
in
short
infer
lead
me
to
gener
the
actual
text
to
a
command
that
is
in
forc
on
christian
and
with
object
not
limit
to
other
christian
trickier
than
the
agap
allel
or
institut
of
communion
there
is
the
case
of
the
great
commiss
where
matthew
mark
the
twelv
are
sent
out
to
evangel
proclaim
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
close
at
hand
the
verb
is
imper
kerusset
but
the
context
is
rather
specif
to
the
twelv
and
there
are
further
specifi
a
in
do
not
turn
your
step
to
pagan
territori
and
do
not
enter
ani
samaritan
town
the
lukan
parallel
are
even
more
specif
to
jesu
final
journey
to
jerusalem
which
make
it
harder
to
see
thi
gener
to
all
christian
than
the
previou
exampl
that
hasnt
prevent
christian
from
make
such
an
infer
what
i
have
to
call
attent
to
is
that
such
infer
is
not
justifi
in
the
text
nor
unlik
the
first
two
case
i
cite
by
the
rhetor
of
the
evangelist
urg
on
the
reader
still
paul
seem
to
have
felt
oblig
to
proclaim
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
close
at
hand
even
contrari
to
jesu
instruct
to
the
to
the
gentil
to
the
end
of
the
earth
so
christian
after
him
have
also
taken
thi
a
a
command
in
the
sens
of
john
do
i
accept
thi
i
dont
know
it
is
sure
rather
specul
but
you
see
how
the
rippl
of
infer
spread
out
from
the
text
that
is
the
pretext
christian
may
infer
a
gener
command
applic
to
all
from
what
is
present
in
the
gospel
a
a
specif
occas
i
do
not
necessarili
object
to
thi
kind
of
gener
but
i
insist
that
peopl
who
make
it
must
have
an
understand
that
they
are
reason
at
some
consider
length
from
what
we
actual
have
in
scriptur
there
are
assumpt
involv
in
thi
reason
and
these
are
not
themselv
scriptur
though
peopl
will
do
their
best
to
justifi
their
assumpt
by
other
refer
to
scriptur
which
simpli
add
more
infer
into
the
mix
let
move
on
to
the
great
command
that
we
should
love
god
with
our
whole
heart
and
mind
and
soul
thi
is
perhap
the
synopt
equival
of
john
agap
allel
and
yet
it
is
not
present
a
a
command
in
our
text
rather
the
context
is
controversi
with
the
pharise
to
cite
matthew
ff
but
when
the
pharise
heard
that
he
had
silenc
the
sadduce
they
got
togeth
and
to
disconcert
him
one
of
them
put
a
question
master
which
is
the
greatest
command
of
the
law
it
is
by
no
mean
obviou
here
though
i
accept
it
a
such
that
jesu
answer
is
meant
to
be
a
command
to
christian
he
is
answer
a
polem
from
hi
enemi
mark
account
in
cast
the
answer
in
a
far
more
posit
light
a
so
the
scribe
in
thi
version
say
far
more
import
than
ani
holocaust
i
need
to
point
out
that
thi
word
origin
in
the
context
of
anim
sacrific
forget
the
nazi
for
thi
or
sacrific
luke
is
intermedi
he
ha
a
lawyer
pose
the
question
to
disconcert
jesu
and
get
the
good
samarian
parabl
for
hi
pain
luke
the
context
here
are
so
confusingli
variou
that
one
could
be
forgiven
for
draw
no
infer
in
no
account
is
thi
said
a
if
it
were
obvious
to
be
taken
a
a
command
bind
on
christian
though
i
think
it
an
entir
reason
conclus
in
each
case
that
jesu
think
it
to
be
so
the
point
is
that
our
mental
gear
have
to
grind
a
cycl
or
so
to
get
to
ani
conclus
from
all
of
thi
about
what
we
are
command
to
do
by
jesu
and
all
of
thi
is
conting
on
our
understand
the
point
of
jesu
use
of
the
torah
in
the
all
quit
differ
gospel
account
and
the
applic
of
such
a
context
to
u
the
differ
context
among
the
synopt
are
curiou
it
should
be
note
that
onli
in
luke
do
we
get
the
fix
of
thi
command
by
the
parabl
of
the
good
samaritan
we
may
look
for
an
analog
intent
in
matthew
where
give
the
golden
rule
a
the
mean
of
the
law
and
the
prophet
and
where
we
may
also
hear
an
echo
of
hillel
say
the
same
a
gener
befor
jesu
if
we
make
these
associ
which
i
think
are
entir
reason
we
are
again
indulg
in
infer
the
text
do
not
explicitli
support
u
rather
we
read
the
text
a
have
thi
kind
of
interrelationship
current
literari
theori
call
thi
intertextu
my
discuss
of
whi
the
agap
allel
ha
to
appli
beyond
the
commun
of
the
discipl
and
beyound
the
circl
of
christian
believ
appli
again
here
to
buttress
a
conclus
that
thi
is
despit
the
present
not
say
so
explicitli
a
command
to
christian
few
christian
would
disagre
with
my
conclus
but
i
must
point
out
that
they
are
conclus
they
depend
on
rather
elabor
chain
of
reason
that
are
simpli
not
present
in
the
text
themselv
the
contextu
problem
keep
come
up
more
and
more
sever
a
we
look
at
those
say
of
jesu
that
are
not
so
univers
taken
by
christian
a
command
and
we
get
some
realli
hard
case
take
divorc
mark
is
pretti
clear
the
man
who
divorc
hi
wife
and
marri
anoth
is
guilti
of
adulteri
against
her
cf
luke
except
that
matthew
ha
an
escap
claus
except
in
the
case
of
fornic
thi
seem
to
be
a
rather
clear
command
whether
or
not
we
take
matthew
reserv
and
some
christian
to
thi
day
take
it
so
but
some
dont
at
least
in
practic
thi
is
rather
peculiar
it
is
not
a
if
jesu
were
not
explicit
about
thi
wherea
he
say
noth
at
all
about
some
of
the
thing
peopl
gnash
their
teeth
over
how
is
it
possibl
if
the
command
of
christ
are
clear
that
matthew
can
so
disagre
with
the
other
evangelist
of
the
synopt
tradit
im
go
to
continu
thi
examin
into
evermurki
water
but
thi
is
enough
to
start
with
the
theme
is
find
command
in
scriptur
is
an
exercis
in
infer
our
infer
are
inform
by
our
assumpt
that
is
our

bia
i
have
so
far
identifi
a

in

some
of

the

alreadi
strike
at
some
of

i

almost
no
evid
