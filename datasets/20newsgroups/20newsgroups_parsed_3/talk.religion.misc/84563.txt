re
what
right
joakim
ruud
write
recent
ive
ask
myself
a
rather
interest
question
what
right
doe
god
have
on
our
live
alway
assum
there
is
a
god
of
cours
in
hi
infinit
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectli
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
accord
to
hi
rule
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
let
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creat
everi
one
of
u
directli
or
indirectli
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happen
is
that
he
first
creat
u
and
then
turn
u
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
creat
i
guess
i
ought
not
conclud
from
thi
then
that
sinc
you
didnt
ask
to
be
creat
you
dont
care
if
you
go
to
hell
let
make
an
analogu
if
a
scientist
creat
a
uniqu
live
creatur
which
ha
happen
it
wa
even
patent
doe
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behav
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impos
it
rule
on
u
who
can
tell
if
god
is
realli
so
righteou
a
god
like
u
to
believ
are
all
christian
a
flock
of
sheep
unabl
to
do
otherwis
that
follow
the
rest
i
dont
consid
myself
an
unthink
sheep
the
bibl
say
god
creat
u
to
be
in
communion
and
obedi
to
him
the
first
and
onli
rule
wa
to
not
eat
of
a
certain
tree
or
el
the
punish
is
distanc
from
him
and
physic
death
god
intent
in
creat
u
is
to
have
a
relationship
with
u
the
bibl
document
god
attempt
to
have
that
relationship
culmin
in
the
person
of
jesu
to
bear
the
consequ
of
all
sin
so
that
all
who
accept
him
can
have
a
relationship
with
god
again
the
purpos
of
creation
who
is
god
to
impos
rule
on
u
he
god
and
he
creat
u
i
suppos
he
ha
a
right
base
on
who
he
is
abov
you
mention
in
hi
infinit
wisdom
and
that
what
id
say
god
exemplifi
but
if
you
were
be
sarcast
up
there
then
thi
whole
discus
is
irrelev
eh
and
if
we
believ
god
is
infinit
wise
that
belief
should
inform
our
relationship
with
him
