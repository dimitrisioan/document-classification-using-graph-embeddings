misctaoism
in
articl
write
let
u
not
limit
misctaoism
to
philosophi
but
if
we
dont
limit
it
to
someth
the
discus
degener
into
a
big
amorph
glob
hmmare
you
a
taoist
impos
limit
doe
do
someth
usefulit
give
you
someth
to
go
beyond
it
seem
to
me
that
these
question
more
properli
fall
into
the
categori
of
gener
metaphys
i
would
prefer
ani
misctaoism
to
deal
more
close
with
topic
and
work
more
close
associ
with
at
least
semiorthodox
taoism
with
establish
classic
work
definit
includ
and
work
like
mantak
chia
argu
about
i
tend
to
be
a
bit
critic
of
ani
stratif
of
taoism
i
especi
tend
to
frown
on
ani
suggest
that
orthodoxi
or
classic
have
ani
special
place
in
tao
i
think
neotaoism
should
be
exclud
or
get
it
own
group
what
i
mean
by
thi
is
humptydumpti
taoism
in
which
taoism
mean
whatev
a
poster
say
it
mean
thi
alttaoism
could
also
be
a
refug
for
debat
about
what
taoism
realli
mean
or
specul
on
sexual
alchemi
etc
so
rather
than
debat
what
taoism
realli
mean
you
are
suggest
that
we
take
someon
el
word
for
it
and
work
thusli
id
rather
not
thank
you
what
happen
is
that
that
the
term
taoism
is
becom
complet
pollut
and
trivial
like
the
word
magic
alchemi
zen
etc
by
writer
appropri
the
word
to
mean
whatev
they
want
thi
is
seen
by
the
spate
of
new
age
book
entitl
the
tao
of
thi
that
and
everyth
el
wherea
you
of
cours
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
the
word
mean
can
you
tell
the
tao
ani
other
commentsidea
i
look
forward
to
see
them
on
balanc
i
say
let
misctaoism
rip
and
let
the
chip
fall
where
they
may
wonder
idea
it
just
get
fill
up
with
colleg
freshman
ask
about
the
tao
of
sex
then
it
will
have
been
a
failur
and
peopl
will
post
to
these
group
just
a
they
do
now
onli
if
you
choos
to
defin
failur
in
that
way
or
to
defin
it
at
all
i
believ
in
the
flesh
and
the
appetit
see
hear
and
feel
are
miracl
and
each
part
and
tag
of
me
is
a
miracl
