re
the
univers
and
black
hole
wa
re
year
bruce
salem
write
is
thi
zeno
paradox
no
zeno
paradox
is
resolv
by
show
that
integr
or
an
infinit
seri
of
decreas
term
can
sum
to
a
finit
result
noth
can
get
out
of
a
black
hole
becaus
the
escap
veloc
is
the
speed
of
light
i
dont
know
how
time
dialat
can
prevent
matter
spiral
in
from
get
to
the
event
horizon
can
ani
one
explain
how
matter
get
in
well
suppos
a
probe
emit
radiat
at
a
constant
frequenc
wa
sent
toward
a
black
hole
a
it
got
closer
to
the
event
horizon
the
red
shift
would
keep
increas
the
period
would
get
longer
and
longer
but
it
would
never
stop
an
observ
would
not
observ
the
probe
actual
reach
the
event
horizon
the
detect
energi
from
the
probe
would
keep
decreas
but
it
wouldnt
vanish
expt
never
quit
reach
zero
i
guess
the
abov
probabl
doesnt
make
thing
ani
more
clear
but
hope
you
will
get
the
gener
idea
mayb
keith
