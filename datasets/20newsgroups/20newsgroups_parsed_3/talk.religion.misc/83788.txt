from
in
articl
robert
wei
say
just
briefli
on
someth
that
you
mention
in
pass
you
refer
to
differ
interpret
of
creat
and
say
that
mani
christian
may
not
agre
so
what
that
is
realli
irrelev
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
mani
peopl
think
one
way
or
anoth
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popular
of
opinion
im
sorri
i
thought
we
were
discuss
heresi
i
assum
that
heresi
meant
a
departur
from
orthodoxi
in
which
case
gener
accept
belief
is
inde
an
import
issu
in
thi
case
the
definit
of
the
word
creat
is
of
great
import
sinc
creation
is
the
issu
be
discuss
also
i
find
it
rather
strang
that
in
tri
to
persuad
that
creat
and
etern
exist
are
equival
you
say
grant
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclus
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
address
in
order
to
repli
to
the
issu
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
wa
rais
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclus
that
you
grant
i
should
have
said
given
the
mormon
belief
if
you
disagre
with
the
mormon
belief
that
creation
is
more
a
function
of
organ
of
etern
exist
substanc
than
one
of
ex
nihilo
creation
then
that
is
the
import
point
the
bibl
state
that
lucif
wa
creat
the
bibl
state
that
jesu
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradict
that
we
have
is
that
the
ld
belief
is
that
jesu
and
lucif
were
the
same
correct
you
interpret
the
bibl
to
mean
someth
veri
specif
by
such
term
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
child
of
god
liter
there
is
noth
symbol
about
it
thi
howev
contradict
what
the
bibl
say
the
bibl
teach
that
not
everyon
is
a
child
of
god
it
alway
crack
me
up
when
antimormon
presum
to
tell
mormon
what
they
believ
mormon
do
in
fact
believ
that
all
peopl
includ
christ
and
lucif
are
child
of
god
in
the
sens
that
we
were
all
creat
or
organ
or
whatev
by
him
we
also
believ
that
be
offspr
of
god
ha
a
symbol
sens
when
appli
to
be
spiritu
born
again
of
him
thu
the
same
word
can
be
use
to
convey
differ
mean
thi
is
how
languag
work
robert
and
it
whi
make
someon
an
offend
for
a
word
is
danger
thi
is
realli
a
red
her
it
doesnt
address
ani
issu
rais
but
rather
it
seek
to
obfusc
the
fact
that
some
group
tri
to
read
someth
into
the
bibl
doesnt
chang
what
the
bibl
teach
for
we
first
look
to
the
bibl
to
see
what
it
teach
to
discount
or
not
even
address
what
the
bibl
teach
becaus
there
are
some
group
that
have
differ
view
is
selfdef
to
see
what
the
bibl
teach
you
have
to
look
at
the
bibl
on
the
contrari
robert
it
is
not
a
red
her
at
all
to
show
that
those
who
reli
wholli
on
the
bibl
can
not
seem
to
agre
on
what
it
say
you
say
that
one
must
simpli
look
at
the
bibl
to
see
what
it
teach
but
centuri
of
peopl
do
just
that
have
shown
that
no
one
is
realli
sure
what
it
say
are
we
to
believ
that
you
are
the
onli
one
who
realli
understand
the
scriptur
i
find
thi
rather
curiou
when
i
mention
that
the
mormon
belief
is
that
jesu
need
to
be
save
i
put
forward
some
quot
from
the
late
apostl
bruce
mcconki
the
curiou
part
is
that
no
one
address
the
issu
of
jesu
need
to
be
save
rick
come
the
closest
with
hi
i
have
my
own
conclus
to
address
the
point
let
me
clarifi
thi
one
more
time
you
did
not
refer
to
the
mormon
belief
that
jesu
need
to
be
save
but
rather
to
mcconki
belief
in
same
we
keep
tri
to
point
out
to
you
that
bruce
mcconki
is
not
the
sourc
of
mormon
doctrin
and
you
keep
ignor
it
see
below
most
of
the
other
repli
have
instead
hopscotch
to
the
issu
of
bruce
mcconki
and
whether
hi
view
were
offici
doctrin
i
dont
think
that
it
matter
if
mcconki
view
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issu
were
mcconki
write
indic
of
mormon
belief
on
thi
subject
is
the
real
issu
the
indic
from
rick
is
that
they
may
certainli
be
on
the
contrari
robert
if
you
are
quot
mcconki
word
a
mormon
canon
then
the
question
of
whether
they
are
canon
or
not
is
of
great
import
the
fact
is
that
they
are
not
whether
or
not
they
indic
gener
mormon
belief
would
onli
be
ascertain
by
interview
a
larg
number
of
mormon
