from
brian
ceccarelli
im
curiou
to
know
if
christian
ever
read
book
base
on
critiqu
on
the
religion
classic
text
such
a
age
of
reason
by
pain
or
the
myth
maker
by
jacobi
sometim
it
is
good
to
know
your
enemi
and
if
you
want
to
do
seriou
research
you
have
to
understand
both
side
and
not
sole
the
one
and
onli
right
one
ye
one
doe
i
examin
a
critiqu
of
the
book
of
roman
by
i
think
benjamin
franklin
onc
a
deist
i
found
it
amaz
that
benjamin
franklin
miss
the
whole
boat
i
also
have
the
write
on
thoma
jefferson
sit
on
my
shelf
and
it
is
amaz
how
much
he
miss
i
have
studi
plato
theori
of
form
and
aristotelian
hylomorphes
what
a
pile
of
junk
jesu
make
plato
and
aristotl
look
like
kindergarden
psycholog
the
id
ego
superego
by
freud
element
of
truth
but
jesu
explain
it
far
better
and
gave
reason
thoma
pain
benjamin
franklin
thoma
jefferson
are
mere
men
they
can
screw
up
the
bibl
just
a
well
a
ani
man
i
do
not
put
these
men
on
a
pedest
and
if
i
rememb
tj
autobiographi
correctli
he
thought
thoma
pain
wa
the
most
unread
man
he
ever
met
here
some
more
circular
reason
to
you
paul
say
to
the
corinthian
that
that
the
gospel
will
be
foolish
to
the
world
becaus
it
is
spiritu
discern
and
so
peopl
without
the
spirit
of
god
havent
a
clue
to
what
the
bibl
is
say
from
your
point
of
view
that
incred
circular
and
conveni
to
me
it
is
mysteri
and
supernatur
bizarr
i
can
see
it
but
you
cant
thi
is
not
arrog
on
my
part
trust
me
it
is
a
bizarr
to
you
a
it
is
to
me
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
truth
explain
or
not
are
ani
of
you
color
blind
to
red
and
green
i
am
rememb
those
dot
test
they
do
at
the
optomologist
they
put
pictur
in
front
of
you
and
you
are
suppos
to
identifi
the
pattern
in
the
dot
if
your
eye
are
perfectli
normal
you
can
see
letter
or
numer
embed
in
the
dot
they
are
a
slightli
differ
color
and
stand
out
from
the
background
but
if
you
are
color
blind
to
red
and
green
you
will
not
see
anyth
but
grayshad
dot
that
is
how
a
dot
test
appear
to
me
i
do
not
see
a
pattern
at
all
a
normal
see
person
will
see
the
pattern
and
to
him
i
seem
like
a
total
anomali
to
him
i
appear
a
if
i
am
miss
the
univers
or
someth
it
is
hard
for
him
to
understand
whi
i
cant
see
anyth
that
to
him
is
a
plain
a
day
that
it
what
it
is
like
with
the
bibl
the
word
of
god
to
the
believ
the
believ
can
see
the
mean
in
the
word
i
can
see
how
the
pattern
fit
togeth
there
is
such
depth
such
consist
but
then
on
the
other
hand
i
notic
the
nonbeliev
he
doesnt
see
it
he
think
i
am
weird
becaus
he
think
i
am
see
thing
i
look
at
him
and
say
no
you
are
weird
you
do
not
see
then
it
is
time
for
a
saniti
check
i
go
to
anoth
christian
and
say
do
you
see
thi
and
they
go
ye
it
is
an
x
and
i
say
thank
god
i
see
the
x
too
it
is
truli
the
strangest
thing
it
add
a
littl
extra
dimens
to
the
phrase
he
will
make
the
blind
see
and
the
deaf
hear
i
am
glad
that
jesu
ha
enabl
me
to
see
i
wish
everi
nonbeliev
could
see
what
they
are
miss
