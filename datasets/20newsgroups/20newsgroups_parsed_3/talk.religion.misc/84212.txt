my

that
brian
will
want
to
step
out

the
way
my
fear
though
is
that
brian
will
instead
choos
to
glue
himself
to
the
middl
of
the
highway
where
he
will
certainli
get
run
over
but
if
he
so
choos
he
so
choos
and
there
is
noth
i
can
do
beyond
that
to
chang
hi

at

brian
hasnt
gotten
even
that
far
he
is
still
at
the
point
where
he
doe
not

he
move

satisfi
with
