thi

employ
forc
on
other
peopl
is
immor
period
unfortun
from
time
to
time
we
are
oblig
to
do
thi
immor
thing
for
reason
of
selfpreserv
and
so
we
have
to
bear
the
moral
consequ
of
that
sinc
both
statement
to
all
intent
and
purpos
say
effect
the
same
thing
are
you
seriou
two
statement
one
of
which
say
that
use
of
forc
in
the
given
situat
is
moral
and
the
other
of
which
say
it
is
not
moral
say
effect
the
same
thing
ye
when
you
tag
on
the
unfortun
then
to
all
intent
and
purpos
you
are
say
the
same
thing
then
delet
the
unfortun
now
tell
me
that
the
two
statement
say
effect
the
same
thing
and
to
save
everyon
a
coupl
of
trip
round
thi
loop
pleas
notic
that
we
are
onli
oblig
to
use
forc
to
preserv
self
we
can
choos
not
to
preserv
self
which
is
the
point
of
pacif
ok
got
you
i
conced
your
point
though
the
word
oblig
strongli
impli
that
one
must
sometim
use
forc
a
further
rephras
would
give
you
the
distinct
you
mention
howev
if
i
have
you
right
a
pacifist
would
not
even
go
on
to
say
unfortunatelyetc
would
you
say
thi
of
ani
two
statement
one
say
x
is
moral
and
the
other
say
x
is
immor
how
would
you
decid
when
two
statement
x
is
moral
x
is
immor
actual
conflict
and
when
they
say
effect
the
same
thing
what
they
prescrib
that
one
should
do
is
a
pretti
good
indic
and
in
thi
case
they
dont
prescrib
the
same
thing
so
ye
fair
enough
though
whi
confus
thing
by
say
that
one
is
somtim
oblig
if
the
real
mean
is
that
one
is
never
oblig
and
lead
one
to
do
precis
the
same
thing
then
either
both
statement
are
doublespeak
or
none
they
might
lead
you
to
do
the
same
thing
but
the
differ
is
what
motiv
pacif
so
they
obvious
dont
lead
pacifist
to
to
the
same
thing
that
not
true
you
could
formul
a
pragmat
belief
in
minimum
forc
and
still
be
a
pacifist
if
the
minimum
is
great
but
one
is
alway
tri
to
get
a
close
to
forc
a
possibl
under
that
belief
not
the
same
a
forc
is
immor
period
but
still
tend
to
pacif
if
you
dont
think
the
use
of
forc
is
immor
whi
minimis
it
use
if
you
dont
think
that
it
is
immor
period
