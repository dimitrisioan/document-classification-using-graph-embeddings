do
you
see
ani
flaw
in
thi
the
problem
is
your
use
of
the
word
object
along
with
valu
both
definit
three
and
four
are
inher
subject
that
is
they
are
particular
to
a
given
individu
or
person
you
see
what
one
person
may
see
a
worthwhil
anoth
may
see
a
worthless
if
on
the
other
hand
some
thing
have
object
worth
use
or
import
it
would
be
interest
to
know
what
they
are
again
your
form
of
measur
in
thi
sentenc
that
be
of
worth
is
subject
if
you
can
provid
an
object
foundat
for
moral
then
that
will
be
a
good
begin
im
not
will
to
attempt
thi
until
someon
provid
an
object
basi
for
the
notion
that
scienc
is
use
worthi
or
import
in
deal
with
observ
fact
altern
you
could
tri
to
demonstr
to
me
that
scienc
is
not
necessarili
use
worthi
or
import
in
ani
situat
in
other
word
i
need
to
know
how
you
use
the
term
object
when
i
find
that
my
usag
of
a
word
is
differ
than
the
usag
of
that
word
given
by
anoth
person
i
tri
to
find
a
standard
against
which
to
judg
that
usag
in
most
case
the
dictionari
is
the
standard
i
use
here
is
a
definiton
of

object

by
thi
definit
scienc
doe
not

sinc
the
phrase
object
worth
is
an
oxymoron
howev
you
ask
someth
a
littl
differ
thi
time
you
ask
for
an
object
basi
for
a
notion
the
fact
that
the
use
of
scienc
a
an
intellectu
tool
is
respons
for
chang
in
our
world
the
chang
are
materi
and
thu
object
would
provid
an
object
basi
for
an
argument
howev
the
conclus
arriv
at
from
that
argument
that
scienc
is
good
is
subject
i
think
that
the
problem
here
is
one
of
word
usag
take
a
littl
time
and
read
the
definit
of
these
word
object
subject
worth

moral
good
evil
i
believ
that
if
you
think
about
the
mean
of
them
for
a

you
will
have
to
conclud
that
there
is
no
such
