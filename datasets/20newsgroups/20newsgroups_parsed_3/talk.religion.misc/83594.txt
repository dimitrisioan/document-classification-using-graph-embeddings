comment
shortli
after
that
post
i
realiz
two
thing
i
wa
run
a
fever
of
over
and
that
i
probabl
should
not
have
gone
directli
from
read
altslack
to
post
on
thi
august
newsgroup
it
is
not
ad
hominen
to
point
out
that
mr
archer
willingli
print
blatant
lie
in
defens
of
bibl
inerr
and
thu
is
worthless
a
an
expert
wit
okay
im
game
give
u
a
list
of
blatant
lie
from
encyclopedia
of
biblic
difficulti
or
other
archer
write
that
would
be
interest
if
onli
a
veri
short
list
can
be
gener
i
think
it
is
more
like
that
mr
archer
with
hi
iner
mindset
is
not
alway
imparti
and
made
a
doozi
of
a
mistak
imho
i
also
think
that
thi
mindset
tend
to
gener
these
sort
of
mistak
on
the
other
hand
if
a
long
list
can
be
gener
it
is
more
like
that
mr
archer
intent
us
decept
in
h
book
whi
should
he
be
decept
just
with
tyre
so
archer
is
just
sit
around
rub
hi
hand
and
plot
how
next
to
deceiv
ok
let
see
the
list
thi
wa
an
open
question
i
assum
that
if
mr
archer
is
a
chronic
liar
someon
whould
have
document
it
thi
assumpt
is
base
on
how
talkorigin
regular
have
document
numer
case
of
creationist
decept
such
a
duan
guish
and
hi
friend
no
long
list
of
archer
mistak
ha
yet
been
given
so
thi
may
be
just
