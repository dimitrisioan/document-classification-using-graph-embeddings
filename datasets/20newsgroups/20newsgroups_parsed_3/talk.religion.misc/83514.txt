while
recogn
that
our
own
action

not
moral
my
opinion
is
that
our
action
would
be
moral
and
it
would
be
immor
not
to
act
if

would
be
both
necessari
and

my
usag
of
my
opinion
is
an
admiss
that
i
dont
have
a
lock
on
moral
not
that
there
is
no
truth
about
moral
to
have
a

period
unfortun
from

we
are
oblig

so
we
have
to
