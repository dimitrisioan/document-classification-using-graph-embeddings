we
say
that
christian
moral
is
mark
pundur

mathew
write
mark
pundur
write
in
mathew
write
there
no
object
physic
einstein
and
bohr
have
told
u
that
speak
a
one
who
know
rel
and
quantum
mechan
i
say
bullshit
speak
a
someon
who
also
know
rel
and
quantum
mechan
i
say
go
ahead
punk
make
my
day
my
degre
can
beat
up
your
degre
ok
refer
u
to
the
place
in
einstein
or
bohr
write
where
he
said
there
no
object
physic
ah
you
take
everyth
a
liter
quotat
no
wonder
your
confus
first
can
i
ask
that
we
decid
on
a
definit
of
object
there
no
object
realiti
lsd
should
be
suffici
to
prove
that
speak
a
one
who
ha
taken
lsd
i
say
bullshit
well
ill
have
to
bow
to
your
superior
knowledg
on
that
one
but
i
think
i
detect
a
pattern
in
your
respons
how
about
some
actual
support
for
your
dismiss
you
take
lsd
and
it
skew
your
percept
of
realiti
you
come
down
and
your
percept
unskew
and
how
could
strive
toward
an
ideal
be
in
ani
way
use
if
the
ideal
had
no
object
exist
a
perfectli
effici
power
station
would
convert
all
of
the
energi
in
coal
into
electr
there
is
absolut
no
way
we
can
build
a
perfect
power
station
it
an
ideal
but
strive
toward
that
ideal
is
undeni
use
and
valuabl
is
it
not
ok
let
me
narrow
the
question
is
it
use
to
strive
toward
a
nonexist
object
ethic
id
guess
that
it
might
be
in
what
way
it
may
be
the
case
that
some
peopl
are
unabl
to
evalu
complex
moral
issu
rather
than
leav
them
to
behav
immor
it
might
be
better
to
offer
them
an
abstract
nonexist
object
system
of
ethic
which
they
can
strive
toward
code
into
rule
which
they
dont
have
to
deriv
for
themselv
i
tend
to
feel
that
thi
is
pretti
much
what
we
all
have
a
moral
anyway
