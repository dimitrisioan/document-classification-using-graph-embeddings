follow
to
me
in

a
similar
accus
of
hypocrisi
again

on
a
lack
of
respons
to

toward
stephen
i
point
out
that
i
did
in
fact
agre
that
both
robert
wei
and
jim
meritt
took
quot
out
of
context
henc
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
whi
jim
think
i
am
a
hypocrit
needl
to
say
i
dont
have
time
to
repli
to
everi
articl
on
trm
that
take
a
quot
out
of
context
i
ask
jim
the
follow
so
accord
to
you
jim
the
onli
way
to
critic
one
person
for
take
a
quot
out
of
context
without
be
a
hypocrit
is
to
post
a
respons
to
everi
person
on
trm
who
take
a
quot
out
of
context
jim
repli
by
say

assert
that
but
today
we
find
four
articl
from
jim
one
of
which
ha
the
subject
silenc
is
concurr
jame
meritt
write
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
the
eye
of
the
law
when
someon
is
awar
of
someth
and
ha
the
capabl
of
take
action
and
doe
not
that
individu
may
be
held
respons
for
that
action
which
is
of
cours
a
complet
red
her
take
quot
out
of
context
isnt
a
crime
i
dont
have
time
to
read
everi
articl
on
trm
and
im
certainli
under
no
oblig
to
repli
to
them
all
doe
silenc
is
concurr
impli
that
jim
think
that
becaus
i
didnt
respond
to
wei
articl
i
must
condon
wei
take
quot
out
of
context
jim
doesnt
want
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
thi
question
read
what
he
ha
written
and
decid
for
yourself
but
back
to
the
context
of
my
convers
with
jim
jim
next
gambit
wa
to
claim
that
he
wa
use
induct
logic
when
he
conclud
that
i
wa
be
a
hypocrit
i
challeng
him
to
provid
the
detail
of
that
logic
that
led
him
to
an
incorrect
conclus
today
we
find
anoth
obscur
articl
post
it
twice
didnt
help
make
it
more
clear
jim
titl
induct
logic

an

given
that
the
popul
of
goos
is
uncount
larg
and
the
size
of
the
confid
interv
for
the
decis
is
undetermin
under
what
condit
could
a
decis
upon
the
behavior
of
the
individu
toward
white
goos
be
made
if
onli
black
goos
are
observ
to
be

is
it
not
a
valid
question
to
be
concern
with
the
differ
behavior
between
black
and
white
goos
more
red
her
could
jim
mean
that
he
ha

vast
major
of
them
are

some
are
discuss
with

meritt
where
i
take
the
posit
that
he
is
make
bad
argument
a
