where

not
avail
the
lukewarm
stew
he

may
well
be
an
inevit
result
of
the
divin
mix
himself
up
with
a
bunch
of
loser
such
a
human
also
unfortun
perhap
i
have
a
deadlin
in
two
week
the
respons
for
which
prevent
me
in
good
conscienc
from
write
a
more
consid
respons
and
fulli
enter
the
fray
a
it
were
let
me
then
say
what
i
can
briefli
the
two
command
are
rule
they
are
mere
rule
that
are
so
vagu
that
they
are
practic
devoid
of
mean
thi
point
for
the
netbrows
who
also
still
read
book
is
pursu
throughli
in
kaufmann
critiqueofreligionandphilosophi
the
command
to
love
your
neighbor
a
yourself
can
be
view
in
part
a
remind
man
that
he
is
not
god
and
can
not
act
a
if
he
ha
ultim
respons
thi
is
a
theolog
statement
worthi
of
barth
dr
turpin
dd
may
wear
the
black
robe
of
geneva
yet
inde
mani
tradit
present
an
interpret
where
believ
are
suppos
to
interpret
love
one
neighbor
a
follow
variou
other
rule
and
reli
on
their
god
to
make
thing
come
out
right
precis
becaus
it
would
be
wrong
for
man
to
assum
such
ultim
respons
onc
again
we
are
confront
with
good
sound
goo
that
mean
whatev
the
reader
want
it
to
mean
thi
requir
the
assumpt
that
all
interpret
are
equal
valid
that
there
is
no
way
of
reason
distinguish
among
them
i
wouldnt
make
that
assumpt
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reason
assumpt
and
who
is
to
say
that
thi
interpret
is
twist
there
are
mani
passag
in
the
bibl
that
in
their
most
straightforward
read
show
the
christian
god
behav
in
just
thi
way
michael
and
i
and
other
read
the
bibl
with
christian
glass
among
the
thing
that
thi
should
impli
is
that
the
nt
inform
the
ot
even
to
the
point
of
domin
it
some
point
in
the
ot
ceremoni
dietari

are
explicitli
abrog
by
the

text
to
drive
russel
turpin
point
with
adequaci
one
need
to
begin
with

text
probabl
from
matthew
and
probabl
about

just
tri
to
help
thi
part
is
i
discov
what
most
move
me
to
post
ml
i
am
a
radic
christian
onli
in
that
i
take
the
gospel
serious
no
michael
the
conserv
christian
also
take
the
gospel
serious
what
differenti
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
russel
turpin
no
here
is
misplac
not
to
say
inappropri
michael
selfdescript
much
govern
the
equat
of

which
seem
impli
by
russel
turpin
is
wrong

ml
tell
you
someth
about
christian
michael
question
get
to
a
heart
of
the
matter
klingon
have
two

so
my
metaphor
is
not
mix
just
extraterrestri
russel
turpin
in
an
earlier
post
had
said
that
michael
michael
theolog
posit
actual
didnt
tell
him
much
about
christian
dean
simeon
respond
thi
time
gentli
what
do
you
mean
more
direct
perhap
would
have
been
what
could
you
possibl
mean
the
impli
rhetor
effort
to
separ
michael
from
the
tradit
is
a
failur
michael
is
in
the
tradit
if
your
idea
of
the
tradit
doesnt
includ
him
chang
your
idea
of
the
tradit
the
ironi
here
is
that
there
is
noth
in
christian
per
se
that
michael
can
use
to
support
the
caus
of
lesbian
and
gay
how
can
one
answer
thi
while
stay
on
the
more
gener
issu
im
on
the
other
side
of
the
interpret
fenc
from
michael
on
thi
issu
yet
noth
is
a
hideou
overstat
one
vers
is
enough
to
refut
it
ill
offer
two
from
paul
of
all
peopl
in
jesu
christ
there
is
neither
male
nor
femalegalatian
i
dont
quot
singl
vers
a
a
rule
and
i
dont
carri
them
in
my
head
and
noth
shall
separ
u
from
the
glori
of
god
roughli
from
roman
if
russel
would
promis
to
convert
base
on
these
or
ani
other
vers
id
promis
to
get
the
full
context
for
ani
that
he
requir
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principl
that
make
michael
christian
benefici
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
a
benefici
perhap
moreso
without
be
filter
by

thi
conclus
doe
not
