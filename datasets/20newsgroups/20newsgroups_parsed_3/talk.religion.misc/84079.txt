re
is
it
good
that
jesu
die
jason
smith
write
brian
kendig
write
and
i
felt
torn
when
i
began
to
disagre
with
a
lot
of
what
the
bibl
and
my
priest
told
me
did
it
start
get
a
littl
uncomfort
did
your
style
start
feel
a
bit
cramp
ye
that
exactli
what
i
felt
my
heart
just
felt
that
what
i
wa
be
taught
wa
wrong
a
basic
good
messag
but
frame
in
error
i
could
not
with
a
clear
conscienc
accept
that
woman
were
somehow
not
equal
to
men
that
homosexu
are
guilti
of
their
lifestyl
that
pride
in
one
work
is
a
bad
thing
that
jesu
die
for
me
i
dont
want
anybodi
to
die
for
me
especi
a
an
imperson
act
where
the
person
cant
possibl
even
know
me
well
enough
to
realli
know
if
im
worth
die
for
or
not
i
wa
never
abl
to
accept
the
bit
about
jesus
death
be
a
good
thing
if
that
mean
that
im
just
not
comprehend
a
basic
messag
of
christian
then
so
be
it
mayb
im
just
not
compat
with
christian
i
just
refus
to
follow
rule
blindli
and
sinc
i
cant
even
convinc
myself
that
your
god
even
exist
in
the
way
you
describ
it
ive
got
to
just
follow
my
own
conscienc
in
these
matter
i
know
how
that
goe
know
i
couldnt
and
didnt
want
to
live
up
to
those
impossibleand
rather
incoveni
rule
are
what
kept
me
outsid
too
dont
think
that
my
moral
are
shoddi
or
nonexist
just
becaus
i
dont
believ
in
your
god
i
will
not
steal
and
i
will
not
murder
not
becaus
i
fear
divin
repudi
but
becaus
these
just
arent
in
my
charact
you
may
think
there
noth
keep
me
from
just
run
around
on
a
murder
spree
steal
thing
when
im
abl
insult
peopl
for
the
heck
of
it
becaus
im
not
answer
to
anyon
but
youd
be
wrong
im
answer
to
myself
a
life
like
that
would
be
a
cheap
life
i
happen
to
want
to
earn
respect
in
myself
till
i
met
the
man
that
is
my
initi
break
with
christian
came
after
a
lot
of
soulsearch
and
a
lot
of
wonder
whi
i
could
no
longer
feel
the
presenc
of
god
with
me
i
final
decid
that
i
had
onc
felt
thi
presenc
just
a
i
had
felt
my
mighti
teddi
bear
besid
me
when
i
wa
a
littl
tyke
protect
me
from
the
monster
under
the
bed
that
i
had
believ
in
god
just
a
i
had
believ
in
the
teddi
bear
a
someth
of
an
emot
crutch
to
protect
me
from
perceiv
danger
sinc
then
ive
never
abandon
the
possibl
that
mayb
your
supernatur
triniti
doe
exist
but
there
are
a
few
time
when
in
my
darken
room
by
my
bed
i
have
set
asid
everyth
i
believ
for
a
moment
and
call
out
to
whatev
out
there
becaus
i
want
to
know
the
truth
even
if
it
mean
abandon
everyth
i
know
and
i
have
not
yet
receiv
an
answer
onli
when
i
truli
listen
to
myself
bodi
and
soul
did
i
realiz
that
i
could
no
longer
honestli
keep
up
the
charad
of
be
christian
there
is
a
higher
truth
in
the
univers
and
christian
just
aint
it
ani
suggest
on
what
or
who
or
where
it
might
be
and
whi
nope
it
may
well
be
unknow
scientist
have
suggest
that
the
univers
may
be
finit
and
wrap
around
on
itself
the
threedimension
univers
may
be
map
onto
a
fourdimension
superspher
in
the
same
way
you
can
map
a
twodimension
plane
onto
a
threedimension
sphere
see
sphereland
the
sequel
to
flatland
for
more
thought
on
thi
our
entir
univers
might
just
be
an
electron
in
a
four
dimension
univers
which
in
turn
may
onli
be
an
insignific
speck
in
a
univers
abov
that
and
so
on
and
so
forth
until
the
variabl
becom
too
much
for
u
to
even
specul
on
that
is
there
no
possibl
way
for
u
to
know
exactli
how
we
came
to
be
so
there
no
reason
at
all
to
believ
that
your
god
exist
nor
had
anyth
to
do
with
it
ok
you
may
say
so
now
if
im
just
be
good
am
i
do
good
enough
that
for
you
to
answer
if
you
feel
your
do
fine
then
go
ahead
and
ignor
u
foolish
littl
christian
we
can
present
what
weve
seen
and
experienc
provid
our
wit
but
it
isnt
up
to
u
to
make
that
seed
sprout
christian
have
provid
me
with
noth
except
quot
from
your
holi
book
and
all
sort
of
tactic
to
tri
to
get
me
to
believ
guilt
trip
insinu
that
im
without
moral
argument
from
disbelief
how
can
you
possibl
believ
that
god
doesnt
exist
and
so
forth
all
im
ask
is
for
you
to
convinc
me
i
want
to
be
convinc
but
it
not
go
to
be
easi
so
much
a
you
dont
like
what
were
sell
there
just
may
be
someon
out
there
that
can
identifi
with
it
methink
you
could
give
u
all
a
lesson
in
toler
and
back
off
have
had
year
upon
year
of
contact
with
your
religion
from
both
the
insid
and
the
outsid
i
view
it
a
harm
in
mani
way
it
prey
on
peopl
who
want
to
find
mean
in
their
live
and
onc
it
got
these
peopl
it
teach
them
to
have
piti
and
sometim
starkli
intoler
of
other
who
do
not
share
these
view
mayb
youll
say
that
your
religion
doesnt
teach
that
but
ive
got
to
judg
christian
from
the
christian
i
know
i
feel
that
it
is
entir
possibl
and
good
to
have
faith
in
one
self
and
to
be
a
posit
influenc
on
societi
for
no
better
reason
than
that
so
i
hope
that
my
word
in
thi
newsgroup
will
at
least
make
some
peopl
think
i
want
christian
to
realiz
that
there
are
perfectli
valid
lifestyl
and
opinion
that
have
noth
to
do
with
their
deiti
whatsoev
and
i
want
peopl
who
are
consid
christian
to
realiz
that
christian
doe
not
hold
the
sole
key
to
a
happi
fulfil
life
i
have
known
some
veri
nice
christian
who
have
done
some
veri
nice
thing
i
think
what
set
these
peopl
apart
from
the
gener
mass
is
that
they
recogn
that
their
religi
belief
may
be
wrong
and
they
know
the
weak
of
their
religion
yet
they
still
decid
to
believ
but
they
keep
their
belief
to
themselv
and
do
not
think
ani
le
of
peopl
who
dont
agre
with
them
obvious
the
debat
on
the
verac
and
reliabl
of
the
sourc
of
the
christian
faith
is
far
from
conclus
notwithstand
how
vehement
we
propos
otherwis
precis
my
point
youv
still
not
given
me
a
reason
to
be
a
christian
instead
of
a
buddhist
or
a
moslem
the
nice
thing
about
religion
if
you
lose
yourself
deepli
enough
in
it
is
that
eventu
youll
be
abl
to
feel
justifi
in
most
anyth
you
want
to
do
yknow
your
right
fortun
for
everyon
around
me
im
not
religi
im
a
christian
just
a
the
moslem
arent
religi
and
the
buddhist
arent
religi
who
is
religi
