the
fact
of
the
theori
in
articl
andi
peter
write
stuff
delet
andi
i
think
we
do
agre
given
your
clarif
of
how
we
were
each
use
the
term
fact
and
theori
ill
onli
add
that
i
think
perhap
i
feel
more
strongli
about
separ
them
though
your
usag
is
quit
valid
note
that
the
fact
of
evolut
is
still
a
theori
in
other
word
it
could
theoret
still
be
falsifi
and
reject
but
sinc
it
so
predict
and
so
consist
support
by
evid
it
seem
pointless
to
explicitli
tri
to
falsifi
it
anymor
ill
add
here
that
ani
falsif
or
reject
doe
not
in
ani
way
reduc
it
current
use
so
long
a
it
accur
predict
or
describ
thing
we
can
observ
not
to
be
a
pain
in
the
as
but
is
there
ani
reason
you
dont
just
say
the
theori
of
evolut
rather
than
the
fact
of
evolut
is
still
a
theori
im
ask
becaus
thi
whole
thread
got
start
becaus
i
wa
bother
by
a
post
that
refer
to
the
fact
of
evolut
basic
leav
off
the
phrase
is
still
a
theori
without
a
clarif
like
the
one
you
just
gave
just
say
the
fact
of
evolut
ha
a
veri
differ
mean
to
me
descript
of
atom
theori
and
altern
theori
of
graviti
delet
both
are
veri
use
model
that
have
no
religi
overton
or
requir
of
faith
unless
of
cours
you
want
to
demand
that
it
is
a
factual
physic
entiti
describ
exactli
the
way
the
theori
now
formul
talk
about
it
here
is
where
you
fail
to
make
an
import
distinct
you
have
shoehorn
the
fact
of
the
exist
of
graviti
and
atom
and
evolut
into
one
categori
with
the
theori
which
have
been
propos
to
explain
the
mechan
the
exist
of
these
thing
is
so
predict
a
to
be
consid
fact
the
mechan
on
the
other
hand
are
still
worth
discus
im
not
sure
i
agre
here
again
it
may
be
becaus
i
feel
stronger
about
separ
term
i
wa
tri
to
say
that
the
theori
propos
to
explain
the
mechan
and
the
mechan
themselv
are
the
onli
realiti
here
it
is
the
exist
of
mechan
not
the
thing
themselv
that
are
so
predict
a
to
be
consid
fact
a
you
would
say
there
arent
realli
littl
planetari
particl
system
call
atom
out
there
or
i
should
say
and
more
to
my
origin
point
it
would
be
a
leap
of
faith
to
say
there
are
becaus
we
observ
onli
the
mechan
there
is
no
need
to
believ
there
are
actual
atom
out
there
a
we
have
decid
to
think
about
them
it
enough
to
discus
the
mechan
at
ani
rate
im
not
sure
i
am
be
ani
clearer
than
befor
but
i
thought
it
wa
worth
a
shot
the
bottom
line
though
is
i
think
we
agre
on
two
fundament
idea
evolut
is
a
theori
support
by
observ
evid
my
way
the
fact
of
evolut
is
a
theori
support
by
observ
evid
your
way
creation
is
just
an
opinion
if
a
theist
want
to
call
it
a
theori
then
he
can
i
wont
it
ha
no
support
evid
and
it
neither
predict
nor
support
ani
observ
that
can
be
made
with
no
mechan
to
talk
about
there
realli
isnt
much
