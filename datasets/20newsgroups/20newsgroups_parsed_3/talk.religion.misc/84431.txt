re
after
year
can
we
say
that
christian
moral
is
in
my
mind
to
say
that
scienc
ha
it
basi
in
valu
is
a
bit
of
a
reach
scienc
ha
it
basi
in
observ
fact
id
say
that
what
one
choos
to
observ
and
how
the
observ
is
interpret
and
what
signific
it
given
depend
a
great
deal
on
the
valu
of
the
observ
scienc
is
a
human
activ
and
a
such
is
subject
to
the
same
potenti
for
distort
a
ani
other
human

the
myth
that
scientist
are
abov
moral
influenc
or
ethic
concern
that
their
knowledg
can
be
abstact
whole
and
pure
from
natur
untaint
by
the
bias
of
the
scientist
is
nonsens
bill
if
one
is
to
argu
for
object
valu
in
a
moral
sen
then
one
must
first
start
by
demonstr
that
moral
itself
is
object
consid
the
mean
of
the
word
object
i
doubt
that
thi
will
ever
happen
so
back
to
the
origin
question
and
object
moral
is
thi
may
be
an
unfortun
choic
of
word
almost
selfcontradictori
object
in
the
sen
use
here
mean
someth
immut
and
absolut
while
moral
describ
the
behavior
of
some
group
of
peopl
the
first
term
is
all
inclus
the
second
is
specif
the
concept
supposedli
describ
may
have
mean
howev
if
there
is
a
god
a
describ
by
the
christian
for
instanc
then
he
ha
exist
apart
from
and
independ
of
humankind
hi
exist
is
outsid
of
our
frame
of
refer
realiti
if
thi
be
declar
a
thing
to
be
so
it
is
necessarili
so
sinc
he
ha
defin
himself
a
omnipot
and
if
hi
claim
are
to
be
believ
he
is
at
least
omnipot
rel
to
u
god
is
intrins
selfdefin
and
all
realiti
is
whatev
he
say
it
is
in
an
object
sen
if
god
determin
a
standard
of
conduct
that
standard
is
object
if
human
be
are
held
account
for
their
conform
to
that
standard
while
permit
to
ignor
it
they
substitut
a
rel
moral
or
mode
of
conduct
give
the
term
moral
a
nebul
meaningless
sen
that
can
be
argu
about
by
those
pretend
to
misunderstand
the
standard
is
object
and
the
conduct
requir
to
meet
that
standard
is
therefor
object
determin
just
becaus
it
is
conveni
to
pretend
that
the
term
moral
is
infinit
malleabl
doesnt
mean
that
the
object
standard
itself
doesnt
exist
moral
ha
come
to
mean
littl
more
than
a
cultur
norm
or
the
prefer
conduct
of
decent
peopl
make
it
seem
subject
but
it
is
deriv
from
an
absolut
object
standard
iron
thi
object
standard
is
in
perfect
accord
with
our
true
natur
accord
to
christian
at
least
yet
is
condemn
a
be
contrari
to
human
nre
oppress
and
sever
thi
may
be
due
a
bill
much
to
our
amor
inclin
a
to
the
standard
itself
but
like
it
or
not
it
therex
