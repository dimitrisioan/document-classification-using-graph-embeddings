no

einstein
and
bohr
have
told
u
that
speak

i
say
bullshit
speak
a

who
also
know

i
say
go
ahead
punk
make
my
day
my
degre
can
beat
up
your
degre
simpl
take
out
some
physic
book
and
start
look
for
statement
which
say
that
there
is
no
object
physic
i
doubt
you
will
find
ani
you
might
find
statement
that
there
is
no
object
length
or
no
object
locat
but
no
object
physic
consid
for
instanc
that
speedoflightin
vacuum
is
invari
thi
sound
an
aw
lot
like
an
object
speedoflightinvacuum
or
you
can
tri
not
confus
a
construct
with
the
constructor
if
you
take
a
look
at
quantum
mechan
mani
object

howev
physic
is
not

bohr
said
the
random
of
atom
motion
is
inher
in
the
motion
itself
einstein
said
that
natur
is
determinist
it
is
our
method
of
observ
that
insert
the
random
they
were
talk
about
the
exact
same
result
but
neither
of
them
claim
to
have
experiment
evid
that
prove
them
right
in
a
similar
vein
there
is
a
yet
no
experiment
evid
for
supersymmetr
particl
so
some
physicist
believ
in
them
and
some
dont
but
all
agre
that
either
there
is
an
object
true
answer
to
the
question
depend
on
how
you
look
at
