possibl

and
thi
is
the
real
point
is
it
not
whi
did

about

doe
he
repres
a

or
is
he
exercis
hi
true

and
put
forth
veri
complex
pictur
with
no
easi
answer
a
pictur
which
leaf
room
for

mani
interpret
it
is
quit
easi
for
me
to
see
for
exampl
that
all
of
oto
deriv
out
of
the
dribbl
of
falter
masonri
purchas
by
clever
huckster
with
an
ounc
of
courag
and
some
write
abil
to
aid
them
and
i
can
take
that
all
the
way
down
to
our
present
caliph
whose
feebl
support
of
the
law
of
thelema
is
laughabl
at
best
would
i
be
thrown
out
of
the
order
for
speak
in
thi
way
will
i
i
think
not
whi
becaus
my
frater
will
see
it
a
a
perspect
an
interject
i
am
use
a
an
exampl
my
illustr
show
that
we
may
express
thing
in
the
context
of
a
larger
work
and
the
true
signific
of
thi
may
be
quit
difficult
to
apprehend
at
first
so
it
may
be
with
oto
and
merlinu
x
pleas
look
oto
more
care
i
do
not
support
reusss
word
myself
a
i
am
not
qualifi
to
ass
them
and
i
am
critic
of
their
pompos
if
i
who
am
a
member
of
the
order
take
such
a
stand
and
am
allow
to
continu
do
so
then
what
can
thi
say
about
the
health
of
the
order
doe
it
mean
that
the
order
ha
gone
soft
and
abandon
it
moral
principl
or
doe
it
mean
that
it
is
strong
in
it
abil
to
let
the
will
of
univers
kinship
aris
on
it
own
not
shackl
by
some
dogmat
