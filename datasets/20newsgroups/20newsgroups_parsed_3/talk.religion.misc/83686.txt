re
is
it
good
that
jesu
die
brian
ceccarelli
write
they
do
not
want
to
know
it
or
be
expo
to
light
becaus
their
own
evil
deed
will
be
uncov
and
so
by
their
own
choic
they
will
remain
in
dark
sort
of
like
bug
under
a
rock
howev
some
peopl
but
not
mani
will
not
like
the
dark
sometim
it
get
too
cold
and
too
dark
to
be
comfort
these
peopl
will
crawl
out
from
under
the
rock
and
although
blind
at
first
will
get
accustom
to
the
light
and
enjoy
it
warm
and
after
a
while
by
virtu
of
the
light
they
will
see
the
depth
of
their
own
shortcom
and
how
to
correct
them
and
also
they
will
see
that
there
is
much
much
more
to
thi
world
than
just
the
narrow
littl
experi
under
the
rock
they
will
discov
that
life
under
a
rock
wa
incred
yukki
and
that
life
with
the
light
of
the
world
is
great
so
great
that
they
will
want
to
tell
all
their
friend
about
it
and
i
maintain
some
peopl
do
not
want
to
enter
into
the
light
and
the
knowledg
that
they
alon
are
their
own
master
becaus
they
fear
it
they
are
too
afraid
of
have
to
face
the
world
on
their
own
term
and
so
by
their
own
choic
they
will
remain
in
dark
sort
of
like
bug
under
a
rock
howev
some
peopl
but
not

will
not
like
the

rock
and
although
blind
at
first
will
get
accustom
to
the
light
and
enjoy
it
warmth
and
after
a
while
now
that
they
can
see
thing
for
what
they
realli
are
they
will
also
see
the
height
which
they
can
reach
and
the
place
they
can
go
and
they
will
learn
to
choos
their
own
path
through
the
world
and
they
will
learn
from
their
mistak
and
revel
in
their
success
they
will
see
that
there
is
much
much
more
to
the
world
than
just
the
narrow
experi
under

they
will
discov
that
life
under
