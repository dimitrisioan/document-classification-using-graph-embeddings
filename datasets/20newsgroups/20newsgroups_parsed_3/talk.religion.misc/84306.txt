rob
lanphier
write
these
are
two
conflict
statement
to
say
one
is
a
clarif
of
the
other
is
a
breach
of
logic
i
dont
mind
peopl
shift
their
posit
on
an
issu
it
irrit
me
when
it
is
said
under
the
premis
that
no
chang
wa
made
what
about
deuteronomi
is
it
wrong
now
did
jesu
chang
that
if
anyth
he
clarifi
the
law
such
a
in
that
quot
you
made
in
the
follow
vers
jesu
take
sever
portion
of
the
law
and
expound
upon
the
law
give
clearer
mean
to
what
god
intend
sure
he
doe
thi
howev
he
doesnt
address
the
notion
of
stone
nonvirgin
bride
becaus
thi
need
no
clarif
are
you
go
to
deni
that
deuteronomi
is
not
patent
clear
in
it
intent
i
see
what
you
are
get
at
or
at
least
i
think
i
do
correct
me
if
i
am
mistaken
but
i
think
you
are
ask
me
if
i
still
believ
that
we
should
uphold
all
of
the
law
pertain
to
capit
punish
for
such
thing
a
adulteri
rape
and
other
heinou
crime
a
you
may
recal
jesu
wa
confront
by
thi
same
question
in
regard
to
the
adultress
who
wa
caught
in
the
act
and
brought
befor
jesu
and
hi
repli
let
he
who
is
without
sin
cast
the
first
stone
jesu
doe
not
deni
the
sentenc
that
is
to
due
for
thi
violat
of
the
law
what
do
you
think
of
thi
i
think
you
will
agre
with
me
that
there
are
in
today
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharise
who
know
the
bibl
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believ
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledg
if
there
is
noth
in
the
heart
ill
agre
that
there
is
a
lot
of
modern
day
pharise
that
know
the
bibl
from
end
to
end
and
dont
believ
in
it
depend
on
how
they
use
thi
knowledg
they
can
be
scari
they
can
argu
ani
posit
they
desir
and
back
it
up
with
select
part
of
the
bibl
such
pharise
includ
david
koresh
and
adolph
hitler
i
will
qualifi
thi
by
say
i
dont
know
if
they
actual
believ
what
they
were
preach
but
the
end
certainli
made
the
mean
look
frighten
agre
howev
just
a
scari
are
those
that
dont
know
much
of
the
bibl
but
believ
everi
word
in
fact
thi
is
probabl
scarier
sinc
there
are
far
more
of
these
peopl
from
what
ive
seen
in
addit
they
are
veri
easi
to
manipul
by
the
aforement
pharise
sinc
they
dont
know
enough
to
debat
with
these
peopl
agre
also
if
one
is
to
use
the
bibl
a
a
refer
one
must
alway
be
open
to
differ
interpret
a
a
christian
i
have
the
spirit
of
god
to
verifi
what
i
believ
in
the
word
if
what
the
spirit
tell
me
is
not
back
up
in
scriptur
then
the
spirit
i
am
commun
with
is
not
of
god
after
all
jesu
tell
u
to
test
the
spirit
to
know
for
sure
that
it
is
from
god
christian
is
not
just
a
set
of
rule
it
a
lifestyl
that
chang
one
perspect
and
person
conduct
and
it
demand
obedi
to
god
will
no
it
demand
obedi
to
a
book
if
god
came
down
and
person
told
me
how
i
should
behav
then
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
do
god
will
by
do
it
howev
if
preacher
pastor
and
evangelist
tell
me
to
obey
the
will
of
a
book
written
by
peopl
who
have
been
dead
for
close
to
two
millenia
even
longer
for
the
ot
even
if
i
follow
everyth
in
it
with
my
heart
i
could
scarc
be
honest
with
myself
by
say
im
do
the
will
of
god
i
obey
what
the
spirit
of
god
tell
me
to
do
the
spirit
will
not
violat
anyth
that
is
written
in

bibl
becaus
that
is
the
word
of
god
i
do
not
worship
pastor
preacher
my
wife
my
mother
or
my
father
what
they
tell
me
doe
not
carri
the
weight
of
what
god
tell
me
to
do
and
hi
command
are
rienforc
in
the
bibl
some
peopl
can
live
by
it
but
mani
other
can
not
or
will
not
that
is
their
choic
and
i
have
to
respect
it
becaus
god
respect
it
too
well
if
god
respect
it
so
much
how
come
there
is
talk
in
the
bibl
about
etern
damnat
for
nonbeliev
i
see
littl
respect
emin
from
the
god
of
the
bibl
i
see
a
selfish
and
spite
god
etern
damnat
is
the
consequ
of
the
choic
one
make
in
reject
god
if
you
choos
to
jump
off
a
cliff
you
can
hardli
blame
god

you
go
splat
at
the
bottom
he
know
that
if
you
choos
to
jump
that
you
will
die
but
he
will
not
prevent
you
from
make
that
choic
in
fact
he
sent
hi
son
to
stand
on
the
edg
of
the
cliff
and
tell
everyon
of
what
lie
below
to
prove
that
point
jesu
took
that
plung
himself
but
he
be
god

abl
to
rise
