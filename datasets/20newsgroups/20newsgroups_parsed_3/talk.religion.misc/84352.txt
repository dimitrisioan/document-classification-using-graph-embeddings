joakim
ruud
write
recent
ive
ask
myself
a
rather
interest
question
what
right
doe
god
have
on
our
life
alway
assum
there
is
a
god
of
cours
in
hi
infinit
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectli
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
accord
to
hi
rule
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
let
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creat
everi
one
of
u
directli
or
indirectli
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happen
is
that
he
first
creat
u
and
then
turn
u
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
creat
let
make
an
analogu
if
a
scientist
creat
a
uniqu
live
creatur
which
ha
happen
it
wa
even
patent
doe
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behav
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
