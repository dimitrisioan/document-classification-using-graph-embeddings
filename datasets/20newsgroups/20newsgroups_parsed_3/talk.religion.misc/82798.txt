a
nice
read

first
time
through
now
lead
the
church
i
for
one
do
not
wish
to
be
label
christian
if
those
who
profess
themselv
a
christian
attack
my
belief
becaus
they
are
intoller
for
exampl
of
the
way
my
religion
may
interpret
biblic
scriptur
of
the
same
sourc
to
have
a
differ
mean
and
implic
than
mainstream
christian
would
give
it
it
isnt
so
much
a
matter
of
interpret
of
bibl
text
that
set
mormon
apart
from
orthodoxi
a
it
is
a
matter
of
fabric
about
year
ago
nation
lampoon
had
some
comic
strip
in
them
that
were
drawn
by
neal
adam
they
were
call
son
o
god
comic
it
wa
a
parodi
of
the
jesu
in
the
bibl
in
the
comic
there
were
a
group
of
thirteen
jewish
kid
from
brooklyn
and
when
one
of
them
said
the
magic
word
he
turn
into
son
o
god
he
went
from
a
myopic
curli
head
yarmulk
wear
boy
to
a
replica
of
the
stylizi
portrait
of
jesu
with
long
flow
brown
hair
and
gentil
featur
now
if
someon
were
to
profess
faith
in
thi
natlamp
jesu
and
claim
that
they
were
a
christian
becaus
they
believ
in
thi
natlamp
jesu
we
would
have
to
say
that
thi
wa
fallaci
sinc
thi
jesu
wa
a
fabric
and
did
not
realli
exist
thi
is
the
exact
same
thing
that
the
ld
do
when
they
claim
that
they
are
christian
they
profess
faith
in
jesu
but
the
jesu
that
they
profess
to
have
faith
in
is
a
much
