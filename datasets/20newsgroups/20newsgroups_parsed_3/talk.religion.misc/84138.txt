that
they
are
abov
the
law
and
abov
the
prophet
major
and
minor
and
not
account

the
ten
command

what
is
the
sourc
of
thi
pseudodoctrin
who
is
the
pseudoteach
who
is
the
great
deceiv
ok
here
at
least
one
christian
answer
jesu
wa
a
jew
not
a
christian
in
thi
context
matthew
make
sens
matt
do
not
think
that
i
jesu

to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophet
i
did
not
come
to
abolish
but
to
fulfil
jesu
live
under
the
jewish
law
howev
he
wa
the
culmin
of
the

propheci
and
fulli
obey
god
purpos
vers

for
truli
i
say
to
you

heaven
and
earth
pa
away
not
the
smallest
letter
or
stroke
shall
pa
away
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplish
the
key
to
thi
vers
imho
is
the
last
phrase
jesu
a
the
fulfil
of
the
law
accomplish
what
the
law
wa
suppos
to
accomplish
jesu
did
not
say
that
he
wa
the
fulfil
of
the
law
and
unless
im
mistaken
heaven
and
earth
have
not
yet
pass
away
am
i
mistaken
and
even
assum
that
one
can
just
gloss
over
that
portion
of
the
word
of
jesu
do
you
realli
think
that
all
is
accomplish
vers
whoever
then
annul
one
of
the
least
of
these
command
and
so
teach
other
shall
be
call
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
keep
and
teach
them
he
shall
be
call
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
taken
in
the
context
of
jesu
teach
jewish
peopl
about
live
life
under
the
law
thi
make
sens
then
whi
didnt
jesu
say

that
wa
not

the
fulfil
of
the
law
are
you
say
that

not
mean
do
away
with
the
law
he
had
come
to
earth
to
live
the

a
it
should
be
live
and
fulfil
the
promis
made
by

look
like
your
translat
ha
taken
a
few
liberti
with
the
word
jesu
appear
to
be
do
away
with
the
law
becaus
he
did
not
honor
the
tradit
of
men
a
equal
to
the
law
of
god
he
regularli
lock
horn
with
the
religi
leader
of
the
day
becaus
he
would
not
conform
to
their
rule
onli
god
law
in
the
matthew
passag
jesu
is
defend
hi
dedic
to
the
law
and
defend
himself
against
hi
accusor
almost
the
entir
sermon
on
the
mount
matt
is
dedic
to
help
the
jewish
peopl
understand
the
true
intent
of
the
law
sweep
away
the
clutter
which
had
been
introduc
by
the
pharase
and
their
tradit
onli
help
the
jewish
peopl
in
galatian
paul
describ
the
relationship
of
jesu
to
the
law
in
thi
way
but
befor
faith
came
we
were
kept
in
custodi
under
the
law
be
shut
up
to
the
faith
which
wa
later
to
be
reveal
therefor
the
law
ha
becom
our
tutor
to
lead
u
to
christ
that
we
may
be
justifi
by
faith
but
now
that
faith
ha
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
for
you
are
all
son
of
god
through
faith
in
christ
jesu
i
believ
thi
say
that
after
christ
wa
reveal
the
law
had
serv
it
purpos
ie
our
tutor
to
lead
u
to
christ
and
now
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
the
law
ha
been
fulfil
a
christ
said
he
would
do
you
are
use
your
interpret
of
paul
a
an
argument
against
the
clear
word
of
jesu
god
the
author
of
the
old
law
and
the
christman
jesu
are
the
same
person
therefor
the
old
law
and
the
new
testament
the
last
will
and
testament
of
jesu
are
base
on
the
same
moral
principl
it
make
sens
that
mani
of
the
principl
in
the
old
law
are
reexpress
in
christian
reexpress
care
to
defin
that
a
bit
better
on
the
other
hand
now
that
the
law
ha
fulfil
it
purpos
and
what
are
heaven
and
earth

where
did
they
go
is
all
accomplish
for
exampl
revel
explain
pleas
christian
relat
to
god
through
