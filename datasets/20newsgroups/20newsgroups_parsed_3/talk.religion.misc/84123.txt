god
had
expressli
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelit
were
a
direct
wit
to
god
exist
to
disobey
god
after
know
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefor
immedi

these
law
were
written
for
a
differ
time
and
appli
onli
to
god
chosen
peopl
but
jesu
ha
chang
all
of
that
we
are
live
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immedi
punish
by
death
there
is
repent
and
there
is
salvat
through

lord
jesu
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
peopl
salvat
is
avail
to
everyon
jew
and
gentil
alik
these
are
two
conflict
statement
to
say
one
is
a
clarif
of
the
other
is
a
breach
of
logic
i
dont
mind
peopl
shift
their
posit
on
an
issu
it
irrit
me
when
it
is
said
under
the
premis
that
no
chang
wa
made
what
about
deuteronomi
is
it
wrong
now
did
jesu
chang
that
if
anyth
he
clarifi
the
law
such
a
in
that
quot
you
made
in
the
follow
vers
jesu
take
sever
portion
of
the
law
and
expound
upon
the
law
give
clearer
mean
to
what
god
intend
sure
he
doe
thi
howev
he
doesnt
address
the
notion
of
stone
nonvirgin
bride
becaus
thi
need
no
clarif
are
you
go
to
deni
that
deuteronomi
is
not
patent
clear
in
it
intent
i
think
you
will
agre
with
me
that
there
are
in
today
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharise
who
know
the
bibl
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believ
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledg
if
there
is
noth
in
the
heart
ill
agre
that
there
is
a
lot
of
modern
day
pharise
that
know
the
bibl
from
end
to
end
and
dont
believ
in
it
depend
on
how
they
use
thi
knowledg
they
can
be
scari
they
can
argu
ani
posit
they
desir
and
back
it
up
with
select
part
of
the
bibl
such
pharise
includ
david
koresh
and
adolph
hitler
i
will
qualifi
thi
by
say
i
dont
know
if
they
actual
believ
what
they
were
preach
but
the
end
certainli
made
the
mean
look
frighten
howev
just
a
scari
are
those
that
dont
know
much
of
the
bibl
but
believ
everi
word
in
fact
thi
is
probabl
scarier
sinc
there
are
far
more
of
these
peopl
from
what
ive
seen
in
addit
they
are
veri
easi
to
manipul
by
the
aforement
pharise
sinc
they
dont
know
enough
to
debat
with
these
peopl
christian
is
not
just
a
set
of
rule
it
a
lifestyl
that
chang
one
perspect
and
person
conduct
and
it
demand
obedi
to
god
will
no
it
demand
obedi
to
a
book
if
god
came
down
and
person
told
me
how
i
should
behav
then
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
do
god
will
by
do
it
howev
if
preacher
pastor
and
evangelist
tell
me
to
obey
the
will
of
a
book
written
by
peopl
who
have
been
dead
for
close
to
two
millenia
even
longer
for
the
ot
even
if
i
follow
everyth
in
it
with
my
heart
i
could
scarc
be
honest
with
myself
by
say
im
do
the
will
of
god
some
peopl
can
live
by
it
but
mani
other
can
not
or
will
not
that
is
their
choic
and
i
have
to
respect
it
becaus
god
respect
it
too
well
if
god
respect
it
so
much
how
come
there
is
talk
in
the
bibl
about
etern
damnat
for
nonbeliev
i
see
littl
respect
emin
from
the
god
of
the
bibl
i
see
a
selfish
and
spite
god
god
be
with
you
not
your
thank
malcolm
lee
rob
lanphier
and
for
the
curiou
here
is
my
earlier
post
hmm
for
a
book
that
onli
appli
to
the
israelit
deuteronomi
jesu
sure
quot
it
a
lot
mt
in
addit
he
allud
to
it
in
sever
other
place
mt
mk
jn
and
just
in
case
it
isnt
clear
jesu
thought
the
old
testament
isnt
obsolet
ill
repeat
the
vers
in
matthew
which
get
quot
on
thi
group
a
lot
do
not
think
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophet
i
have
not
come
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfil
them
i
tell
you
the
truth
until
heaven
and
earth
disappear
not
the
smallest
letter
not
the
least
stroke
of
a
pen
will
by
ani
mean
disappear
from
the
law
until
everyth
is
accomplish
anyon
who
break
one
of
the
least
of
these
command
and
teach
other
to
do
the
same
will
be
call
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
practic
and
teach
these
command
will
be
call
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
i
tell
you
that
unless
your
righteous
surpass
that
of
the
pharise
and
the
teacher
of
the
law
you
will
certainli
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
mt
niv
in
pretti
red
letter
so
that
you
know
it
jesu
talk
thi
caus
a
seriou
dilemma
for
christian
who
think
the
old
testament
doesnt
appli
to
them
i
think
that
whi
paul
harvey
like
quot
it
so
much
