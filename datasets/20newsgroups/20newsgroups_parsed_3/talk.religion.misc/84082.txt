write
recent
ive
ask
myself
a
rather
interest
question
what
right
doe
god
have
on
our
life
alway
assum
there
is
a
god
of
cours
he
is
god
in
hi
infinit
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectli
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
accord
to
hi
rule
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
he
is
god
let
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creat
everi
one
of
u
directli
or
indirectli
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happen
is
that
he
first
creat
u
and
then
turn
u
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
creat
god
grant
you
the
gift
of
life
whether
you
were
sinner
or
saint
let
make
an
analogu
if
a
scientist
creat
a
uniqu
live
creatur
which
ha
happen
it
wa
even
patent
doe
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behav
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
the
scientist
creat
the
live
creatur
to
examin
it
poke
and
prod
it
and
learn
about
it
behaviour
he
will
kill
it
if
it
becom
a
threat
for
exampl
let
say
the
scientist
creat
a
tyrannosauru
rex
and
it
break
free
of
it
confin
and
start
devour
the
popul
the
scientist
would
not
hesit
in
kill
it
god
creat
u
to
be
hi
love
companion
he
know
whether
we
are
true
in
our
love
for
him
or
not
and
he
let
u
know
the
consequ
of
reject
him
god
can
not
abid
by
sin
by
reject
god
a
person
becom
an
enemi
of
god
one
that
must
be
kill
by
him
note
i
say
that
god
and
god
alon
is
worthi
to
be
judg
juri
and
execution
we
are
not
call
to
carri
out
such
duti
becaus
we
are
not
worthi
who
is
god
to
impos
it
rule
on
u
who
can
tell
if
god
is
realli
so
righteou
a
god
like
u
to
believ
are
all
christian
a
flock
of
sheep
unabl
to
do
otherwis
that
follow
the
rest
god
is
god
who
are
we
to
question
the
creator
if
you
doubt
god
do
in
certain
situat
do
you
claim
to
know
a
better
solut
would
you
be
play
the
role
of
god
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
thi
is
not
sarcasm
i
mean
it
how
should
one
deal
with
a
man
who
is
convinc
that
he
is
act
accord
to
god
will
and
who
there
jokk
fore
belief
that
he
is
