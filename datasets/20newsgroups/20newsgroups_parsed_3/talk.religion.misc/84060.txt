i
believ
the

past
these
fact
exist
with

without

the

tri
and
explain
the
fact
and
how
they
relat
to
the
rest
of
the
physic
univers
in
a
manner
that
is
both
coher
and
use
that
it
can
be

will
exist
and
behav
in
the
way
in
which
they
behav
regardless
of
whether
we
have
a
theori
to
tri
and
explain
how
they
interact
or
even
whi
a
theori
never
realli
becom
a
fact
but
a
theori
can
predict
the
exist
of
a
previous
unknown
fact
and
if
we
find
thi
fact
a
the
theori
predict
we
say
the
theori
is
support
by
the
fact
a
theori
is
a
mental
construct
a
specul
a
model
if
it
is
a
good
model
it
may
be
use
in

a

is
someth
that
is
support
by

sometim
all
of

a

is
a

becaus
there
is
not
yet
enough
evid
to
support
it
when
a
new
hypothesi
is
propos
to
replac
an
exist
theori
it
must
explain
all
of
the
fact
that
the

explain
and
at

some
of
the

it
is
so
simpl

about
onc
a

a
