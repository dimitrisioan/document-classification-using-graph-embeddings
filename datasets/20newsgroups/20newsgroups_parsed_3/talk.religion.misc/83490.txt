say
ra
just
briefli
on
someth
that
you
mention
in
pas
you
refer
to
differ
interpret
of
creat
and
say
that
mani
christian
may
not
agre
so
what
that
is
realli
irrelev
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
mani
peopl
think
one
way
or
anoth
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popular
of
opinion
it
may
be
irrelev
to
you
and
your
person
belief
or
should
i
say
bia
but
it
is
relev
to
me
and
mani
other
your
right
the
bottom
line
is
truth
independ
from
you
or
anyon
el
sinc
you
proclaim
truth
a
a
selfproclaim
appointe
may
i
ask
you
by
what
author
you
do
thi
becaus
it
say
so
in
the
bibl
doe
the
bibl
say
so
or
is
it
you
or
someon
el
who
interpret
whether
a
scriptur
or
doctrin
conform
to
your
particular
like
or
disapprov
excus
moi
but
your
line
of
truth
havent
move
me
one
bit
to
persuad
me
that
my
belief
are
erron
of
all
the
preacher
of
truth
on
thi
net
you
have
struck
me
a
a
selfright
member
of
the
wreck
crew
with
no
posit
messag
to
me
or
ani
other
latterday
saint
btw
thi
entir
discus
remind
me
a
lot
of
the
thing
said
by
jesu
to
the
pharise
ye
hypocrit
ye
preach
about
me
with
your
lip
but
your
heart
are
far
remov
from
me
also
i
find
it
rather
strang
that
in
tri
to
persuad
that
creat
and
etern
exist
are
equival
you
say
grant
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclus
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
address
in
order
to
repli
to
the
issu
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
wa
rais
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclus
that
you
grant
sophistri
look
who
talk
jump
to
conclus
you
wouldnt
do
that
yourself
right
all
you
address
is
your
own
convict
regardless
whether
we
come
up
with
ani
biblic
scriptur
which
support
our
point
of
view
becaus
you
reject
such
interpret
without
ani
consider
whatsoev
the
bibl
state
that
lucif
wa
creat
the
bibl
state
that
jesu
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradict
that
we
have
is
that
the
ld
belief
is
that
jesu
and
lucif
were
the
same
a
beauti
exampl
of
disinform
and
a
deliber
misrepresent
of
ld
doctrin
the
former
kgb
would
have
love
to
employ
you
jesu
and
lucif
are
not
the
same
silli
and
you
know
it
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
child
of
god
liter
there
is
noth
symbol
about
it
thi
howev
contradict
what
the
bibl
say
the
bibl
teach
that
not
everyon
is
a
child
of
god
correct
it
may
contradict
would
you
think
the
bibl
say
the
bibl
inde
doe
teach
that
not
all
are
child
of
god
in
the
sen
that
they
belong
to
or
follow
god
in
hi
footstep
satan
and
hi
follow
have
rebel
against
god
and
are
not
child
followersredeem
of
god
but
it
doesnt
mean
that
they
were
not
onc
creat
by
god
but
chose
to
separ
themselv
from
those
who
chose
to
follow
god
and
hi
plan
of
salvat
the
field
is
the
world
the
good
seed
are
the
child
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tare
are
the
child
of
the
wick
one
matthew
so
thi
illustr
nice
what
i
just
said
the
child
of
the
kingdom
are
those
who
have
remain
valiant
in
their
testimoni
of
jesu
and
have
shown
work
of
repent
etc
and
the
child
of
the
wick
one
are
those
who
rebel
against
god
and
the
lamb
the
issu
of
satan
spiritorigin
and
of
those
who
follow
him
ha
not
been
address
in
thi
and
other
vers
you
copi
from
your

you
purpos
obscur
the
subject
by

your
right
with
non

lot
of
nice
scriptur
delet
not
robert
w
copyright
though
ra
we
are
told
that
and
thi
is
life
etern
that
they
might
know
ra
thee
the
onli
true
god
and
jesu
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
ra
john
life
etern
is
to
know
the
onli
true

yet
the
ra
doctrin
of
the
ld
that
i
have
mention
portray
a
vastli
ra
differ
jesu
a
jesu
that
can
not
be
reconcil
with
the
jesu
of
ra
the
bibl
they
are
so
far
remov
from
each
other
that
to
proclaim
correct
my
jesu
is
inde
differ
than
your
jesu
and
can
be
reconcil
with
the
jesu
in
the
bibl
not
your
interpret
of
him
i
concur
but
i
honestli
couldnt
care
le
ra
one
a
be
true
deni
the
other
from
be
true
accord
to
the
ra
bibl
etern
life
is
depend
on
know
the
onli
true
god
and
ra
not
the
construct
of
imagin
in
thi
singl
post
of
your
ive
seen
more
construct
of
imagin
than
in
all
of
the
prold
mail
combin
i
have
read
so
far
in
thi
news
group
first
get
your
ldsfact
straight
befor
you
dare
preach
to
u
about
the
onli
true
god
whom
you
interpret
accord
to
your
own
like
and
dislik
but
whose
imag
i
can
not
reconcil
with
what
i
know
about
him
myself
i
guess
your
grandios
selfimag
doe
not
allow
for
other
faith
believ
in
the
divin
of
jesu
christ
but
in
a
differ
way
or
fashion
than
your
own
not
that
it
realli
matter
the
mission
and
progress
of
the
ld
church
will
go
on
boldli
and
nobli
and
no
mob
or
oppon
can
stop
the
work
from
progress
until
it
ha
visit
everi
contin
swept
everi
clime
and
sound
in
everi
ear
thi
is
realli
a
red
her
it
doesnt
address
ani
issu
rais
but
rather
it
seek
to
obfusc
the
fact
that
some
group
tri
to
read
someth
into
the
bibl
doesnt
chang
what
the
bibl
teach
sigh
what
the
bibl
teach
or
what
the
bibl
teach
accord
to
robert
wei
and
co
i
respect
the
former
i
reject
the
latter
without
the
remotest
feel
that
i
have
reject
jesu
on
the
contrari
and
by
the
way
i
do
respect
your
interpret
of
the
bibl
i
even
grant
you
be
a
christian
follow
your
own
imag
of
him
a
much
a
i
am
a
christian
follow
my
own
imag
of
him
in
my
heart
most
of
the
other
repli
have
instead
hopscotch
to
the
issu
of
bruce
mcconki
and
whether
hi
view
were
offici
doctrin
i
dont
think
that
it
matter
if
mcconki
view
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issu
were
mcconki
write
indic
of
mormon
belief
on
thi
subject
is
the
real
issu
the
indic
from
rick
is
that
they
may
certainli
be
the
issu
is
of
cours
that
you
love
to
use
anyth
to
either
mi
repres
or
ridicul
the
ld
church
the
issu
of
offici
doctrin
is
obvious
veri
import
mcconki
view
have
been
controversi
eg
the
seven
deadli
heresi
ha
made
me
a
heret
at
best
or
erron
at
worst
black
not
to
receiv
the
priesthood
in
thi
dispens
i
respect
him
a
someon
who
ha
made
hi
valuabl
contribut
to
the
church
but
i
person
do
not
reli
on
hi
person
interpret
hi
book
mormon
doctrin
is
oftentim
refer
to
a
mcconki
bibl
in
mormon
circl
on
mormon
doctrin
i
rather
look
to
offici
doctrin
sourc
and
to
hugh
nibley
book
the
last
comment
is
an
ldsinsid
refer
summar
mcconki
wa
a
wise
man
who
contribut
undoubtedli
far
more
to
the
kingdom
of
god
than
i
have
but
whose
view
are
by
no
mean
dogma
or
accept
doctrin
some
of
it
clearli
belong
to
person
interpret
and
specul
but
have
said
thi
i
find
mcconki
even
in
hi
most
bias
and
specul
moment
far
more
thoughtprovok
than
the
trash
come
from
