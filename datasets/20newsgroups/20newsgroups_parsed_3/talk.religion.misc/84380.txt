re
is
it
good
that
jesu
die
brian
kendig
first
state
i
am
my
own
master
i
ask
are
you
truli
the
master
of
yourself
brian
kendig
state
not
yet
make
up
your
mind
but
my
life
is
the
ground
i
use
to
practic
on
the
fun
is
in
the
get
there
we
dont
start
out
perfect
and
we
do
not
end
perfect
either
we
are
never
perfect
can
you
name
one
person
young
or
old
past
or
present
that
you
deem
perfect
good
luck
i
know
my
shortcom
and
i
know
my
strength
and
i
live
my
life
accord
to
the
decis
i
make
and
i
am
content
to
abid
with
the
consequ
of
my
decis
a
easili
a
ill
accept
the
prais
for
them
there
have
been
time
in
my
life
when
ive
made
mistak
ye
i
tri
to
never
make
the
same
mistak
twice
then
you
lie
to
yourself
you
do
not
know
your
shortcom
i
have
clearli
shown
one
of
your
shortcom
if
not
two
that
is
ignor
of
the
bibl
and
the
arrog
you
demonstr
butcher
it
without
even
know
it
content
i
regard
christ
a
a
myth
becaus
you
have
been
too
pride
to
examin
the
record
of
him
for
yourself
and
to
demonst
your
lack
of
support
for
your
conclus
i
bet
you
do
not
even
know
what
the
word
christ
mean
or
which
prophet
use
christ
to
describ
the
son
of
man
i
feel
that
there
are
far
too
mani
peopl
offer
far
too
mani
interpret
of
what
he
supposedli
said
and
did
the
onli
person
who
can
realli
judg
me
is
me
ye
i
agre
with
that
so
we
must
learn
first
read
the
bibl
come
up
with
our
own
interpret
evalu
what
is
be
said
and
by
whom
check
the
histori
book
a
well
compar
someon
el
interpret
with
your
own
then
make
a
judgment
but
i
tell
you
the
truth
of
what
is
be
said
in
the
bibl
need
interpret
a
much
a
a
coffe
cup
need
interpret
and
rememb
the
bibl
isnt
a
guru
esoter
guid
to
metaphys
it
doesnt
take
a
theologian
to
understand
what
is
be
said
the
bibl
is
a
bunch
of
testimoni
from
peopl
like
you
and
i
address
to
peopl
like
you
and
i
these
guy
wrote
down
what
they
saw
and
heard
is
it
their
open
diaryand
they
want
to
tell
you
someth
and
becaus
they
want
you
to
know
someth
they
make
it
veri
clear
what
they
want
you
to
know
they
didnt
encouch
their
idea
in
esoter
rhetor
but
in
simpl
straightforward
languag
i
choos
the
road
i
travel
and
i
decid
whether
or
not
i
want
to
reach
the
end
of
ani
given
road
or
turn
back
and
a
long
a
i
dont
alway
turn
back
there
no
shame
in
it
when
i
need
help
i
seek
out
my
friend
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoid
the
bibl
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoid
a
confront
with
the
live
god
becaus
that
road
doesnt
look
appeal
to
you
you
rather
build
your
own
road
one
that
goe
far
away
from
that
confront
but
be
assur
of
thi
you
will
have
to
confront
him
one
day
willingli
or
unwillingli
and
you
dont
have
a
clue
about
what
im
say
either
open
your
eye
and
see
open
your
ear
and
listen
im
not
just
spout
off
empti
word
thi
is
my
life
thi
is
what
give
me
mean
i
see
what
you
mean
i
hear
what
your
say
i
am
not
degrad
your
life
but
i
have
heard
the
same
irrat
excus
for
year
there
is
noth
new
in
what
you
are
say
and
by
your
own
word
you
are
spout
off
contradict
if
contradict
give
you
mean
then
your
life
must
be
sad
i
say
my
mother
love
me
how
do
i
know
you
ask
i
can
point
to
definit
thing
she
done
for
me
and
i
can
even
just
bring
her
to
you
so
you
can
ask
her
facetofac
you
say
your
deiti
love
you
how
do
you
know
i
ask
bingo
for
god
so
love
the
world
he
gave
hi
onli
begotton
to
son
so
that
whososev
beliv
in
him
will
have
ever
last
life
i
look
what
god
did
he
ha
given
hi
son
even
to
hi
death
so
that
i
can
have
hope
in
hi
resurrect
and
know
that
life
isnt
for
noth
but
ha
gloriou
purpos
you
cant
even
convinc
me
that
it
exist
becaus
you
turn
your
eye
away
from
testimoni
and
histori
you
choos
to
lie
to
yourself
that
he
doesnt
exist
for
you
ignor
what
ha
been
said
for
thousand
of
year
you
sound
exactli
almost
verbatim
like
the
lazaru
of
jesus
stori
start
in
luke
and
the
conclus
of
that
stori
is
a
bleak
one
lazaru
wound
up
in
hell
the
stori
end
like
thi
for
if
lazaru
doesnt
even
listen
to
mose
and
the
prophet
he
wont
even
believ
if
a
man
rose
from
the
dead
if
ani
god
dangl
heaven
befor
me
like
a
carrot
promis
untold
pleasur
to
me
if
ill
onli
suspend
my
disbelief
and
ignor
my
ration
for
just
thi
onc
then
i
would
choos
hell
i
can
not
lie
to
myself
to
placat
anoth
be
no
matter
how
power
it
is
arrog
at
it
best
the
fact
is
you
are
not
ration
sever
specif
case
have
alreadi
been
cite
and
again
with
thi
new
statement
you
show
more
irration
with
regard
to
heaven
jesu
doe
tell
you
someth
of
what
to
expect
in
heaven
jesu
expect
you
to
use
your
brain
to
believ
in
him
jesu
doe
not
expect
you
to
placat
either
jesu
want
you
to
willingli
come
to
him
but
not
a
hi
grovel
slave
but
rather
a
hi
brother
who
will
share
in
hi
gloriou
rich
whi
do
you
not
pick
up
the
bibl
and
read
it
for
yourself
you
maintain
you
have
an
open
mind
see
whether
you
are
lie
to
yourself
for
yourself
whi
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
that
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
ani
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybodi
el
ani
good
either
becaus
everyon
die
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
lead
a
good
life
is
meaningless
whi
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
that
paragraph
demonstr
that
you
havent
listen
to
a
singl
word
ive
said
i
do
understand
what
you
said
but
that
is
not
what
i
feel
went
amiss

miss
the
point
live
a
good
life
ha
no
etern
consequ
onc

close
the
amus
park
of

to
you
that
is
the
end
to
you
it
is
over
to
you
therefor
your
time
spent
in
the
amus
park
is
meaningless
it
ha
no
etern
consequ
to
you
nor
to
anyon
left
on
earth
but
then
you
contradict
yourself
from
a
previou
post
you
said
do
evil
thing
is
bad
to
you
it
shouldnt
matter
if
you
do
evil
thing
or
