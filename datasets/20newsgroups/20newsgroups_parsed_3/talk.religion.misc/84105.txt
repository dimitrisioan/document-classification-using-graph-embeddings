for
you

you
know
what
happen
in

write
thi
wa
obvious
a
lot
differ
than
the
ordinari
fbi
adventur
i
believ
that
the
feder
offic
had
a
conflict
of
interest
here
throught
out
the
whole
affair
it
seam
to
me
that
they
were
chiefli
concern
with
save
face
rather
than
save
life
it
true
that
the
bd
were
resist
arrest
and
that
they
should
have
surrend
when
they
first
realiz
that
these
where
feder
offic
but
they
didnt
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
save
face
unless
you
are
confus
the
fbi
with
the
batf
who
are
the
one
who
were
in
charg
of
the
origin
search
warrant
but
when
they
didnt
the
fbi
should
not
have
treat
a

situat
it
wasnt
i
think
more
discus
possibl

did
make
a
deal
for
the

koresh
show
he
wa
not

and
there
is
no
reason
to
believ
independ
