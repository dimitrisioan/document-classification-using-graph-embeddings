mcclari
write
just
thought
id
clear
up
a
few
of
the
murki
area
actual
after
surviv
be
driven
out
of
nauvoo
and
later
carthag
the
mormon
did
fortifi
utah
they
still
arm
themselv
to
defend
the
faith
and
stockpil
food
a
well
they
have
been
involv
in
quit
a
lot
of
illeg
activ
includ
multipl
and
often
underag
wife
for
the
leader
a
practic
still
in
vogu
with
some
splinter
of
their
sect
the
parallel
between
koresh
and
joseph
smith
are
strike
by
they
you
mean
the
leader
of
the
ld
church
i
grant
you
that
when
joseph
smith
wa
still
aliv
plenti
of
accus
were
file
most
of
which
had
littl
bear
with
realiti
a
evidenc
by
variou
verdict
i
have
studi
ld
histori
for
year
now
and
i
have
yet
to
see
prove
that
the
ld
leadership
wa
involv
in
quot
illeg
activ
plural
marriag
ye
but
your
charg
of
underag
wife
sound
like
it
could
have
origin
from
a
tabloid
and
discredit
the
high
moral
standard
which
character
these
leader
and
famili
unlik
a
it
appear
those
of
david
koresh
joseph
smith
start
the
sect
after
he
and
hi
brother
hyram
were
murder
in
a
nauvoo
il
jail
cell
church
membership
split
over
who
to
follow
initi
smith
wa
consid
a
prophet
just
like
moham
a
rather
interest
parallel
consid
muslim
consid
christ
to
be
a
prophet
the
same
a
jew
im
led
to
understand
make
no
mistak
thi
wa
no
messiah
were
talk
about
in
smith
the
and
neither
did
he
claim
he
wa
a
the
church
reflect
the
moral
aptitud
of
it
leader
and
especi
those
of
joseph
smith
i
have
noth
but
the
highest
respect
for
thi
inspir
man
whose
onli
crime
wa
that
he
refus
to
deni
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
mani
have
tri
to
explain
the
smith
phenomenon
away
but
the
bold
presenc
of
an
million
member
strong
church
stand
a
a
wit
that
joseph
smith
testimoni
had
enough
resili
and
power
to
carri
on
the
messag
thought
at
the
time
wa
that
the
gift
of
propheci
wa
to
be
hand
down
father
to
son
after
joseph
smith
die
hi
son
wa
onli
enter
hi
teen
brigham
young
and
a
few
other
claim
to
have
been
bequeath
the
gift
and
leadership
prior
to
hi
death
the
council
of
twelv
the
church
govern
bodi
wasnt
of
much
help
here
and
thi
basic
conflict
is
still
a
wedg
between
the
sect
brigham
young
took
hi
follow
to
salt
lake
the
rest
wait
for
smith
jr
to
grow
up
enough
to
assum
leadership
the
other
claimant
to
the
leadership
were
soon
ignor
like
mike
dukaki
the
rest
were
apost
and
excommun
member
of
the
church
while
the
great
major
of
the
membership
the
twelv
and
the
variou
auxiliari
organ
chose
to
accept
brigham
young
a
the
new
prophet
and
leader
of
the
church
if
you
knew
your
ld
scriptur
and
doctrin
you
would
have
known
that
brigham
young
wa
the
first
in
line
to
fill
the
prophet
joseph
smith
vacanc
he
wa
the
senior
apostl
in
the
quorum
and
variou
comment
made
by
joseph

that
it

brigham
who
would
lead
the

other
right
heir
were
either
dead
hyrum

or

and
while
persecut
abound
and
intensifi
joseph

had
alreadi
given
order
to
look
for
a
new
place
an
empti
land
beyond
the
boundari
of
the
unit
state
at
that
time
thi
rekhabit
principl
pseudographia
wa
well
understood
and
antip
by
the

of

where
even
the

these

had
nobodi
to

themselv
just
a
littl
context
to
put
thi
all
in
perspect
btw
sinc
when
is
the
church
of
jesu
christ
of
latterday
saint
one
of
the
largest
denomin
in
the
countri
a
sect
it
didnt
splinter
from
ani
other
religion
a
did
say
the
southern
baptist
or
methodist
so
what
did
the
mormon
get
it
seem
that
j
edgar
hoover
wa
veri
impress
with
the
way
they
kept
secret
theyr
pledg
to
defend
secret
with
their

and
aton
for
sin
with

mani
actual
do
even
to
the
point
of
suicid
what
a
balloney
suicid
is
sin
and
against
the
law
of
god
i
am
not
comfort
with
thi
alleg

with

i
assur
you
that

reject
thi

our
onli
true

is
to
our

and
to
the

which
he
ha
appoint
to
repres
him
in
ani
regard
to
read
thi
trash
about
suicid
and
aton
for

with

is
yet
anoth
insult
misrepresent
of
what
my
church
belief
in

stand
for
the

the

are
friendli
rival
of

delight
in

which
gener
quick

from

everybodi
ha
a

at

i
ever

take
it

though
j
edgar

the
fbi

especi
the

i
have
often
wonder
how
thi
might

of

a

would
consid
heret
preposter
even
if
thi

i

convinc
that
those

that
whi
they
were

in

rememb

that

how
where
or
what
they
may
if
it
true
there
would
be
littl
affect
ld
and
rld
philosophi
is
that
all
other
religion
have
stray
from
the
true

a
set
down
by
jesu

that

will
judg
each
