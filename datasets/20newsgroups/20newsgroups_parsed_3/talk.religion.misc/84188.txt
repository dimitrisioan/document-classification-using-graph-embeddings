been
a
lot
of
discus
about
tyre
in
sum
ezekiel

that
the
place
would
be
mash
and
never
rebuilt
a
there
are
a
lot
of
peopl
live
there
it
would
appear
that
ezekiel
wa
not
liter
correct
thi
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
becaus
i
understand
the
languag
ezekiel
use
differ
than
do
socal
biblic
literalist
for
exampl
it
sometim
happen
that
someon
say
my
grandson
is
the
cutest
babi
and
then
turn
around
and
see
the
granddaught
and
say
oh
isnt
she
the
cutest
thing
thi
person
is
not
liter
claim
to
have
line
up
all
the
babi
in
the
world
accord
to
cute
and
discov
hi
own
grandchild
tie
for
first
rather
he
is
tri
to
express
hi
emot
use
word
that
are
veri
objectori
becaus
thi
exampl
is
one
that
is
common
to
mani
peopl
nobodi
misunderstand
the
intent
of
the
statement
the
bibl
howev
is
often
at
the
merci
of
peopl
who
assum
that
everyth
within
must
be
exactli
liter
true
for
those
peopl
the
exist
of
tyre
is
a
problem
for
me
it
is
not
turn
to
the
latest
person
tri
to
defend
ezekiel
we
read
thi
from
john
e
king
the
prophesi
clearli
impli
that
peopl
would
still
be
live
in
the
area
no
it
impli
noth
of
the
kind
if
you
had
noth
but
the
propheci
from
ezekiel
and
you
were
told
you
interpret
it
liter
you
would
never
say
oh
he
mean
that
there
will
be
hous
and
busi
and
plant
and
stuff
like
that
you
would
read
i
will
make
you
a
bare
rock
and
you
will
never
be
rebuilt
and
youd
conclud
that
tyre
would
be
a
bare
rock
the
onli
way
to
get
from
fish
net
to
hous
and
build
and
a
mediumlarg
popul
is
if
you
know
that
all
that
latter
stuff
is
there
in
other
word
your
answer
mean
that
ezekiel
misl
everybodi
who
read
the
propheci
at
the
time
it
wa
written
there
is
no
way
that
given
a
liter
read
they
could
read
thi
passag
and
conclud
medium
citi
you
seem
to
feel
that
never
be
rebuilt
mean
be
rebuilt
mayb
so
but
it
is
hardli
a
clear
implic
mr
king
also
write
so
far
ive
seen
state
figur
rang
from
to
let
assum
the
latter
one
is
correct
by
modern
standard
we
are
talk
about
a
onehors
town
well
no
that
onli
a
bit
le
than
the
popul
of
annapoli
where
im
from
you
know
the
naval
acadami
the
state
capit
georg
washington
resign
hi
commiss
in
the
statehous
annapoli
may
not
be
new
york
but
it
at
least
a
twohors
town
but
suppos
peopl
is
a
small
town
it
still
peopl
more
than
ezekiel
predict
and
youv
said
noth
about
the
other
problem
in
chapter
ezekiel
predict
that
nebuchadnezzar
will
will
destroy
tyre
and
loot
all
their
valuabl
howev
nebuchadnezzar
did
not
destroy
tyre
and
in
chapter
ezekiel
even
quot
god
a
say
he
and
hi
armi
got
no
reward
from
the
campaign
he
led
against
tyre
let
ignor
alexand
for
a
moment
and
just
pay
attent
to
chapter
ezekiel
say
n
would
destroy
tyre
and
n
did
not
destroy
tyre
ezekiel
say
that
n
would
plunder
their
valuabl
but
n
did
not
plunder
their
valuabl
regardless
of
what
you
think
about
tyre
now
the
fact
is
that
n
die
befor
the
place
wa
destroy
ezekiel
said
n
wa
go
to
do
it
and
n
did
not
thi
post
is
of
cours
pointless
inerrantist
have
an
amaz
abil
to
rewrit
the
bibl
a
need
to
fit
whatev
they
want
it
to
say
for
exampl
i
expect
mr
king
to
respond
to
the
comment
about
ezekiel
by
pull
some
clear
implic
out
of
hat
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
tower
that
clearli
impli
that
the
wall
would
still
be
stand
so
peopl
would
know
where
the
tower
use
to
be
and
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
fine
hous
and
throw
your
stone
timber
and
rubbl
into
the
sea
that
clearli
impli
that
n
would
never
set
foot
on
the
island
and
when
ezekiel
wrote
that
n
would
build
a
ramp
up
to
your
wall
that
clearli
impli
that
n
would
spend
year
stomp
around
on
the
mainland
and
never
get
close
to
the
wall
see
a
few
clear
implic
that
are
