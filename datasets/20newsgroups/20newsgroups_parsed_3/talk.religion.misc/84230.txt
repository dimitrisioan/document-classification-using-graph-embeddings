write
if
almost
all
peopl
agre
that
the

exist
in
the
usual
uncrit

and
almost
all
peopl
agre
that
a
deal
is
bad
it
a
reason
conclus
that
the
sun
realli
doe
exist
and
that
the
deal
realli
is
bad
i
disagre
complet
until
rather
recent
most
peopl
did
not
believ
in
evolut
or
the
possibl
of
the
atom
bomb
popular
opinion
is
notori
wrong
about
matter
of
fact
true
but
nevertheless
the
basi
of
all
matter
of
fact
is
overwhelm
popular
opinion
and
some
overwhelm
popular
opinion
is
fact
the
sun
shine
if
it
were
not
so
physic
would
be
a
person
matter
assum
to
be
differ
for
each
of
u
there
would
be
yourgrav
and
mygrav
and
no
theoret
framework
to
encompass
them
and
predict
both
thi
is
simpli
complet
nonsens
the
basi
for
matter
of
fact
is
if
ani
class
of
opinion
the
major
of
inform
popular
opinion
for
some
valu
of
inform
i
would
realli
hate
to
base
my
knowledg
of
for
instanc
qm
on
what
the
overwhelm
popular
opinion
is
the
basi
eric
is
peopl
peer
at
the
world
and
say
what
they
see
im
talk
about
uninterpret
fact
observ
peopl
do
those
agreement
on
some
observ
is
a
prerequisit
for
a
theori
that
is
more
than
person
ye
that
true
but
you
have
to
be
clear
exactli
what
is
an
uninterpret
observ
it
pretti
low
level
stuff
the
sun
shine
is
alreadi
a
lot
higher
level
than
that
we
can
agre
that
i
perceiv
bright
perhap
now
i
take
an
experi
of
goodevil
to
be
everi
bit
a
raw
a
fact
a
an
experi
of
pain
or
vision
that
might
seem
like
a
good
first
pas
guess
but
it
turn
out
to
be
a
pretti
cruddi
way
to
look
at
thing
becaus
we
all
seem
to
have
rather
differ
opinion
experi
about
what
is
good
and
evil
while
we
seem
to
be
abl
to
agre
on
what
the
meter
say
your
not
compar
appl
with
appl
if
we
all
look
at
the
same
meter
well
agre
if
were
all
in
the
same
situat
that
when
well
agre
on
fundament
valu
if
at
all
peopl
who
say
that
nobodi
agre
on
valu
to
the
same
extent
that
they
agre
on
trivial
observ
seem
to
be
unawar
of
the
extent
of
agreement
on
either
huh
what
do
you
mean
all
in
the
same
situat
let
take
me
and
denni
kriz
a
exampl
were
in
pretti
differ
situat
but
i
think
we
can
agre
a
to
whether
it
day
or
night
i
dont
think
we
can
agre
a
to
whether
or
not
abort
is
moral
accept
yet
we
are
certainli
in
the
same
differ
of
situat
with
respect
to
each
other
look
like
weaselword
to
me
frank
i
dont
see
that
it
ani
evid
at
all
a
i
point
out
abov
im
realli
not
interest
veri
much
in
what
the
popular
opinion
is
im
prepar
to
trustto
some
extent
the
popular
opinion
about
direct
matter
of
physic
observ
becaus
by
and
larg
they
accord
with
my
own
howev
if
everyon
el
said
the
dial
read
and
it
look
like
a
to
me
i
would
hope
that
i
would
believ
myself
ie
believ
other
peopl
about
these
matter
seem
to
have
a
reason
probabl
of
predict
what
i
would
believ
if
i
observ
myself
but
the
possibl
exist
that
it
is
not
sinc
i
know
from
observ
that
other
disagre
with
me
about
what
is
good
i
believ
i
can
discount
popular
opinion
about
good
from
the
begin
a
a
predictor
of
my
opinion
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
it
seem
almost
imposs
to
get
peopl
to
agre
on
what
is
good
in
a
realli
larg
number
of
situat
is
probabl
the
best
evid
that
object
moral
is
bogu
actual
firstli
if
everyon
el
said
the
dial
wa
and
i
saw
id
check
my
len
prescript
that
up
to
you
i
guess
secondli
your
observ
that
peopl
disagre
show
noth
peopl
may
be
look
at
differ
thing
by
virtu
of
be
in
differ
situat
if
i
look
at
an
eleph
ill
see
an
eleph
that
doesnt
impli
that
you
will
see
an
eleph
if
you
look
at
an
iguana
thi
differ
situat
stuff
is
pretti
confus
frank
how
do
we
decid
if
we
are
in
the
same
situat
you
mind
explain
thirdli
i
question
your
assumpt
that
when
peopl
disagre
about
how
to
achiev
fundament
or
secondari
goal
that
they
therefor
do
not
have
the
same
fundament
goal
that
seem
to
be
the
disagr
you
refer
to
huh
i
dont
think
so
i
think
that
peopl
disagre
about
fundament
goal
ekr
