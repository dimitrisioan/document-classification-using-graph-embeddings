who
next
mormon
and

in

isaac
kuo
write
in
articl
red
her
write
the
fbi
claim
on
the
basi
of
their
intellig
report
that
bd
had
no
plan
to
commit
suecid
they
btw
had
bug
the
place
and
were
listen
to
bd
convers
till
the
veri
end
koresh
attorney
claim
that
base
on
some
hour
he
spent
talk
to
hi
client
and
other
in
the
compound
he
saw
no
indic
that
bd
were
contempl
suecid
the
survivor
claim
it
wa
not
a
suecid
it
not
clear
that
more
than
one
of
the
survivor
made
thi
claim
it
is
clear
that
at
least
one
of
the
survivor
made
the
contradictori
claim
that
bd
member
had
start
the
fire
no
thi
is
far
from
clear
we
onli
have
the
word
of
the
fbi
spokepeopl
that
a
survivor
made
thi
claim
we
have
the
contradictori
word
of
the
lawyer
who
spoke
with
the
survivor
individu
that
all
of
them
agre
that
they
did
not
have
a
suicid
pact
and
did
not
intent
start
the
fire
in
the
absens
of
ani
more
evid
i
dont
see
how
we
can
decid
who
to
believ
furthermor
it
quit
possibl
that
there
wa
no
gener
suicid
pact
and
that
some
small
inner
circl
took
it
upon
themselv
to
kill
everyon
el
with
the
state
of
the
area
now
we
may
never
know
what
happen
bd
were
not
contempl
suecid
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believ
they
commit
one
no
reason
how
about
these
two
some
of
the
survivor
claim
that
bd
member
pour
fuel
along
the
corridor
and
set
fire
to
it
the
speed
at
which
the
fire
spread
is
not
inconsist
with
thi
claim
again
we
have
onli
the
word
of
the
fbi
on
thi
claim
the
lawyer
who
have
also
talk
to
the
survor
deni
that
ani
of
them
are
make
that
claim
there
wa
certainli
a
fire
which
kill
most
of
the
peopl
in
the
compound
there
is
a
veri
veri
good
possibl
that
the
fbi
did
not
start
thi
fire
thi
is
a
good
reason
to
believ
that
the
bd
did
i
will
agre
on
your
ass
a
to
the
rel
probabl
it
more
like
that
the
bd
start
the
fire
than
did
the
fbi
but
there
is
current
no
way
to
decid
what
actual
happen
base
on
the
public
avail
evid
which
is
nearli
none
even
if
the
bd
were
not
contempl
suicid
it
is
veri
possibl
that
david
koresh
wa
convinc
and
thu
convinc
the
other
that
thi
wa
not
suicid
it
wa
the
fulfil
of
a
profeci
of
some
sort
there
are
three
possibl
other
than
the
bd
self
destruct
a
they
are
not
dead
but
escap
via
bunkeretc
from
report
of
the
inadequaci
of
the
tunnel
and
the
bodi
found
i
would
rate
thi
a
highli
unlik
b
the
fire
wa
start
by
an
fbi
accid
thi
is
possibl
but
it
would
be
foolish
of
u
to
declar
thi
outright
until
more
evid
can
back
it
sure
it
possibl
that
the
armor
vehicl
knock
down
a
lantern
which
start
the
fire
whi
wa
there
a
lit
lantern
in
the
middl
of
the
day
near
the
edg
of
the
complex
it
anecdot
evid
that
ha
been
contradict
by
other
escape
c
the
fire
wa
start
on
purpos
by
the
fbi
thi
ha
been
suggest
by
some
on
the
net
and
i
would
rate
thi
possibl
a
utterli
ludicr
thi
is
what
we
in
sciskept
would
call
an
extraordinari
claim
and
wont
bother
refut
unless
someon
give
ani
good
evid
to
back
it
up
d
the
fire
wa
an
start
accident
by
the
bd
i
am
trueli
amaz
that
i
have
heard
or
read
of
no
one
suggest
thi
possibl
with
all
the
tear
ga
and
the
lack
of
elect
power
in
the
compound
and
the
adult
wear
ga
mask
it
had
to
have
been
chaotic
insid
i
can
easili
imag
someon
leav
a
lamp
too
close
to
someth
or
accident
drop
a
lamp
or
knock
one
over
with
the
wind
it
would
have
quickli
gotten
out
of
control
so
we
are
left
with
two
reason
possibl
that
the
fire
wa
an
fbi
accid
and
that
the
fire
wa
start
by
the
bd
i
find
the
latter
more
like
base
on
the
evid
ive
seen
so
far
no
i
think
that
d
is
also
quit
reason
i
person
cant
realli
as
ani
rel
probabl
to
either
of
these
probabl
although
if
forc
to
bet
on
the
issu
i
would
probabl
take
an
accid
either
fbi
or
bd
over
intenti
set
of
the
fire
i
would
also
like
to
add
a
comment
relat
to
the
report
that
bodi
recov

wound
the
coron
wa

that
