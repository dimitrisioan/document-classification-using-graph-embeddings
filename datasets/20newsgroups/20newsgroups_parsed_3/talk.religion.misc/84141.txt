re
what
part
of
no
dont
you
understand
in
e
elizabeth
bartley
write
i
can
certainli
see
oppos
the
amen
but
that
doesnt
requir
oppos
a
moment
of
silenc
i
alreadi
respond
to
thi
on
one
dimens
but
afterthought
caus
me
to
make
anoth
independ
repli
the
problem
with
a
moment
of
silenc
is
that
it
is
not
an
evenhand
way
of
allow
for
religion
amongst
student
in
the
public
school
a
i
note
befor
muslim
need
more
than
a
moment
of
silenc
in
order
to
perform
the
prayer
they
are
requir
by
muhammad
to
do
and
at
least
orthodox
jewish
prayer
also
ha
requir
that
are
not
address
by
thi
there
is
in
fact
a
highli
select
bia
toward
christian
prayer
in
thi
moment
of
silenc
shit
and
that
is
especi
bizarr
in
that
christian
prayer
doesnt
need
thi
stuff
a
christain
may
pray
total
incognito
at
ani
time
to
some
extent
thi
is
true
of
muslim
and
jew
a
well
what
i
intend
in
my
first
paragraph
is
that
there
are
some
characterist
form
of
prayer
in
these
religion
which
do
need
special
time
andor
behavior
which
can
not
be
undertaken
without
an
observ
be
abl
take
note
of
it
a
christian
may
pray
at
ani
time
silent
and
without
ani
trace
of
hi
activ
be
evid
to
other
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
of
the
other
religi
tradit
amongst
u
certainli
these
tend
to
have
some
form
of
prayer
that
would
evid
differ
from
americanprotest
mainstream
religion
all
that
a
moment
of
silenc
doe
is
to
allow
that
one
tradit
which
doesnt
need
it
to
have
a
special
place
set
asid
in
the
public
school
there
is
noth
in
christian
prayer
that
requir
public
form
or
rug
or
phylacteri
or
anyth
el
at
all
visibl
to
the
outsid
world
a
christian
student
may
and
probabl
doe
pray
at
innumer
time
dure
the
day
without
anyon
el
know
it
that
may
also
be
true
of
non
christian
i
am
not
claimng
otherwis
in
the
moment
of
silenc
it
would
still
be
difficult
for
the
jew
to
gather
and
daven
for
the
muslim
to
do
their
ablut
and
find
qiblah
to
mecca
and
engag
in
the
prescrib
form
but
of
cours
christian
can
do
their
thing
and
therefor
the
provis
is
noth
but
a
disguis
attempt
to
encourag
just
that
luckili
there
is
a
strong
jewish
presenc
in
thi
countri
and
i
a
a
christian
rever
some
of
the
jewish
teacher
i
had
in
public
school
and
a
grow
muslim
presenc
a
well
i
can
onli
hope
that
the
polit
forc
consequ
on
thi
will
prevent
the
imposit
of
christian
form
on
nonchristian
a
far
a
i
can
see
a
a
christian
there
is
noth
in
thi
moment
of
silenc
campaign
but
an
attempt
to
use
public
social
pressur
to
forc
child
to
adher
to
a
pattern
that
is
bias
toward
christian
and
a
a
christian
i
must
protest
such
coercion
for
what
it
worth
i
suspect
that
the
coercion
is
not
realli
target
at
the
nonchristian
it
is
yet
anoth
case
of
failur
amongst
christian
parent
in
make
their
child
prayer
so
that
they
want
the
public
school
to
teach
what
they
can
not
manag
to
teach
despit
have
all
the
opportun
in
the
world
to
do
so
if
you
have
taught
your
child
to
pray
they
do
not
need
a
moment
of
silenc
in
school
if
you
have
not
manag
to
teach
them
the
moment
will
onli
embarrass
you
give
it
up
michael
l
siemon
i
say
you
are
god
son
of
the
most
high
all
of
you
nevertheless
or
you
shall
die
like
men
and
fall
like
