david
bold
say
i
dont
mean
to
be
rude
but
i
think
that
youv
got
hold
of
the
wrong
end
of
a
differ
stick
david
i
had
a
look
at
your
post
again
and
i
see
what
you
mean
i
wa
so
intent
on
explain
how
jung
thought
we
could
be
more
moral
than
god
that
i
overlook
your
main
line
of
thought
you
seem
to
be
say
that
god
be
unknow
hi
moral
is
unknow
yep
that
pretti
much
it
im
not
a
jew
but
i
understand
that
thi
is
the
jewish
way
of
think
howev
the
jew
believ
that
the
coven
between
yhwh
and
the
patriarch
abraham
and
mose
in
thi
case
establish
a
moral
code
to
follow
for
mankind
even
the
jew
could
not
decid
where
the
boundari
fall
though
a
i
understand
it
the
sadduce
believ
that
the
torah
wa
all
that
wa
requir
wherea
the
pharise
the
ancestor
of
modern
judaism
believ
that
the
torah
wa
avail
for
interpret
to
lead
to
an
understand
of
the
requir
moral
in
all
it
nuanc
talmud
the
essenc
of
all
of
thi
is
that
biblic
moral
is
an
interfac
between
man
and
yhwh
for
a
jew
or
christian
and
doe
not
necessarili
indic
anyth
about
yhwh
outsid
of
that
relationship
although
one
can
specul
the
first
thing
that
come
to
mind
is
that
man
is
suppos
to
be
creat
in
hi
imag
so
there
is
an
argument
that
we
are
commit
to
whatev
moral
code
he
follow
a
part
of
tri
to
live
up
to
that
imag
if
we
are
suppos
to
live
by
christ
exampl
you
would
be
hard
press
to
argu
that
god
is
a
do
what
i
say
not
what
i
do
kind
of
guy
the
troubl
with
all
of
thi
is
that
we
dont
realli
know
what
the
creat
in
hi
imag
mean
ive
heard
a
number
of
differ
opinion
on
thi
and
have
still
not
come
to
ani
conclus
thi
rather
upset
the
appl
cart
if
one
want
to
base
a
life
script
on
thi
shaki
foundat
to
mix
metaphor
unashamedli
a
to
live
by
christ
exampl
we
know
veri
littl
about
jesu
a
a
person
we
onli
have
hi
record
utter
in
a
set
of
narr
by
hi
follow
and
some
veri
small
refer
from
comtemporari
historian
revel
asid
one
can
onli
know
christ
secondhand
or
wors
thi
is
not
an
attempt
to
debunk
christian
although
it
may
seem
that
way
initi
the
point
im
tri
to
make
is
that
we
onli
realli
have
the
bibl
to
interpret
and
that
interpret
is
by
human
i
guess
thi
is
where
faith
or
relev
come
in
with
all
it
inher
subject
metaphys
if
there
are
multipl
moral
code
then
there
is
no
absolut
moral
code
and
i
think
thi
is
theolog
question
no
there
may
be
an
absolut
moral
code
there
are
undoubt
multipl
moral
code
the
multipl
moral
code
may
be
found
in
the
absolut
moral
code
a
an
exampl
a
parent
may
tell
a
child
never
to
swear
and
the
child
may
assum
that
the
parent
never
swear
simpli
becaus
the
parent
ha
told
the
child
that
it
is
wrong
now
the
parent
may
swear
like
a
trooper
in
the
pub
or
bar
where
there
are
no
child
the
wrong
here
is
if
the
child
disobey
the
parent
the
parent
may
feel
that
it
is
inappropri
to
swear
in
front
of
child
but
may
be
quit
happi
to
swear
in
front
of
anim
the
analog
doe
not
quit
hold
water
becaus
the
child
know
that
he
is
of
the
same
type
a
the
parent
and
may
be
a
parent
later
in
life
but
you
get
the
gist
of
it
incident
the
young
child
consid
the
direct
a
absolut
until
he
get
older
see
piaget
and
learn
a
moral
of
hi
own
david
on
religion
oh
where
is
the
sea
the
fish
cri
a
