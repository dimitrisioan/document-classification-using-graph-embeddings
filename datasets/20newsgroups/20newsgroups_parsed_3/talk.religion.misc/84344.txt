thank
you
steve
it
is
refresh
to
have
someon
accus
me
of
be
a
christian
i
onli
hope
enough
evid
can
be
garner
to
get
a
convict
i
am
not
certain
what
you
mean
by
the
fundus
part
a
the
term
fundamentalist
ha
a
wide
varieti
of
use
if
you
refer
to
i
use
it
to
refer
to
those
christian
who
take
a
more
conservativeliteralist
approach
to
the
bibl
a
distinct
from
liber
those
who
actual
believ
jesu
is
the
messiah
and
son
of
god
and
wish
to
follow
in
hi
way
then
i
plead
guilti
but
what
doe
it
i
would
use
the
word
christian
unqualifi
to
describ
someon
to
whom
the
abov
definit
appli
btw
it
appli
to
me
deletia
joe
gaut
indic
hi
interest
in
the
bd
disast
is
from
a
civil
liberti
issu
not
an
attempt
to
justifi
koresh
belief
andor
practic
i
agre
with
joe
about
thi
if
some
group
want
to
believ
in
whatev
god
or
invis
pink
unicorn
and
go
off
and
live
togeth
and
have
group
sex
or
no
sex
or
sex
onli
for
the
leader
but
not
with
child
then
a
much
a
i
might
believ
them
to
be
misguid
i
think
they
should
have
the
legal
right
and
i
hope
the
investig
will
start
by
determin
whether
the
fed
had
ani
legitim
reason
for
go
after
koresh
in
the
first
place
befor
move
on
to
consid
the
wisdom
of
variou
tactic
use
joe
goe
on
to
disput
the
childabus
alleg
ill
provision
accept
thi
unless
someon
ha
evid
to
support
the
alleg
actual
i
wasnt
think
about
the
alleg
child
abus
but
about
the
report
that
he
had
sex
with
and
father
child
by
sever
woman
in
the
cult
i
agre
thi
is
not
a
legal
matter
consent
adult
and
all
that
but
stephen
