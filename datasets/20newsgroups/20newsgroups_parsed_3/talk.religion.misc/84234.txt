theist
and
object
stephen
mcintyr
write
can
a
theist
be
truli
object
can
he
be
imparti
when
question
the
truth
of
hi
scriptur
or
will
he
assum
the
superstit
of
hi
parent
when
question
i
think
that
if
a
theist
were
truli
object
and
throw
out
the
notion
that
god
definit
exist
and
start
from
scratch
to
prove
to
themselv
that
the
scriptur
are
the
whole
truth
then
that
person
would
no
longer
be
a
theist
it
usual
all
ha
to
do
with
how
the
child
is
brought
up
from
the
time
he
is
born
the
theist
is
brought
up
with
the
notion
of
the
truth
of
some
kind
of
scriptur
the
bibl
the
torah
the
quran
etc
he
is
told
of
thi
wondrou
god
who
wrote
or
inspir
the
scriptur
of
the
prophet
talk
about
in
the
scriptur
of
the
miracl
perform
etc
he
is
also
told
that
to
question
thi
a
child
are
apt
to
do
is
a
sin
a
crime
against
god
and
to
lose
belief
in
the
scrip
ture
truth
is
to
damn
one
soul
to
hell
thu
by
the
time
he
is
abl
to
read
the
scriptur
for
himself
the
belief
in
it
truth
is
so
ingrain
in
hi
mind
it
all
seem
a
matter
of
cours
your
miss
someth
here
there
are
peopl
who
convert
from
nontheism
to
theism
after
be
brought
up
in
a
nontheist
household
i
dont
have
ani
statist
a
to
how
mani
though
that
would
be
an
interest
thing
to
know
i
think
that
religion
is
a
crutch
peopl
are
natur
afraid
of
the
unknown
and
the
unexplain
peopl
dont
want
to
believ
that
when
they
die
they
are
dead
finish
that
there
is
noth
els
after
that
and
so
religion
is
kind
of
a
nice
fantasi
religion
also
describ
thing
we
dont
know
about
the
univers
thing
scienc
ha
not
yet
describ
and
it
also
give
peopl
a
feel
of
secur
that
if
they
just
do
thi
one
thing
and
everyth
will
be
ok
that
they
are
be
watch
over
by
a
higher
power
and
it
minion
thi
ha
a
veri
high
psycholog
attract
for
quit
a
few
peopl
and
these
peopl
are
will
to
put
up
with
a
few
discrep
and
hole
in
their
belief
system
for
what
it
gain
them
thi
is
whi
i
think
it
kind
of
useless
to
tri
too
hard
to
convert
theist
to
atheism
they
are
happi
with
their
fantasi
and
they
feel
that
other
peopl
will
be
happi
with
it
too
they
cant
accept
the
fact
that
there
are
peopl
who
would
rather
accept
the
harsh
realiti
that
they
are
run
from
anyway
im
get
kind
of
carri
away
here
but
my
point
is
that
theism
doesnt
have
to
be
ingrain
into
a
child
mindset
for
that
person
to
grow
up
a
a
theist
although
thi
happen
far
too
often
theism
is
design
to
have
it
own
attract
atheist
libertarian
proindividu
prorespons

and
all
that

if
you
know
and
are
sure
of
the
author
of
thi

you
