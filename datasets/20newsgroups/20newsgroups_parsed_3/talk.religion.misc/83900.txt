henc
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
whi
jim
think
i
am
a
hypocrit
needle
to
say
i
dont
have
time
to
repli
to
everi
articl
on
trm
that
take
a
quot
out
of
context
of
cours
not
just
the
one
you
disagre
with
qed
so
accord
to
you
jim
the
onli
way
to
critic
one
person
for
take
a
quot
out
of
context
without
be
a
hypocrit
is
to
post
a
respons
to
everi
person
on
trm
who
take
a
quot
out
of
context
jim
repli
by
say

i
either
ask
or
assert
that
but
today
we
find
four
articl
from
jim
one
of
which
ha
the
subject
so
a
of
then
and
point
out
a
specif
instanc
wrongo
again
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
the
eye
of
the
law
when
someon
is
awar
of
someth
and
ha
the
capabl
of
take
action
and
doe
not
that
individu
may
be
held
respons
for
that
action
which
is
of
cours
a
complet
red
her
take
quot
out
of
context
isnt
a
crime
i
dont
have
time
to
read
everi
articl
on
trm
and
im
certainli
under
no
oblig
to
repli
to
them
all
so
check
the
newsgroup
doe
silenc
is
concurr
impli
that
jim
think
that
becaus
i
didnt
respond
to
wei
articl
i
must
condon
wei
take
quot
out
of
context
jim
doesnt
want
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
thi
question
read
what
he
ha
written
and
decid
for
yourself
telepathi
again
you
claim
to
know
what
i
want
but
back
to
the
context
of
my
convers
with
jim
jim
next
gambit
wa
to
claim
that
he
wa
use
induct
logic
when
he
conclud
that
i
wa
be
a
hypocrit
i
challeng
him
to
provid
the
detail
of
that
logic
that
led
him
to
an
incorrect
conclus
no
you
ask
specif
what
wa
wrong
with
your
today
we
find
anoth
obscur
articl
post
it
twice
didnt
help
mayb
to
the
ignor
i
accept
your
classif
more
red
her
could
jim
mean
that
he
ha
read
an
uncount
larg
number
of
my
articl
do
you
know
what
uncount
larg
mean
it
doe
not
appear
so
could
jim
mean
that
becaus
i
axe
hi
articl
but
not
wei
articl
he
want
to
conclud
induct
well
i
cant
see
where
he
is
go
with
thi
i
am
not
supris
but
i
can
help
him
with
hi
induct
ive
written
roughli
that
doe
not
appear
to
be
the
case
the
appear
of
your
argument
is
more
like
that
captain
kirk
would
have
gotten
from
mr
spock
written
by
a
stagehand
at
paramount
think
hard
about
thi
jim
see
the
pattern
think
harder
run
it
through
your
induct
engin
and
see
what
pop
out
of
cours
you
appear
arrog
so
i
alreadi
had
figur
that
out
