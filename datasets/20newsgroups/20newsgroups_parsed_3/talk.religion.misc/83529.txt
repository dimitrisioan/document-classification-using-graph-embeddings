re
clarif
of
person
posit
jesu
and
the
law
kent
sandvik
write
my
onlin
bibl
is
on
a
cd
but
i
dont
own
a
cdrom
system
for
the
time
be
so
i
cant
search
for
the
famou
cite
where
jesu
explicitli
state
that
he
didnt
want
to
break
exist
jewish
law
in
other
word
technic
speak
christian
should
use
saturday
and
not
sunday
a
their
holi
day
if
they
want
to
conform
to
the
teach
of
jesu
i
think
the
passag
your
look
for
is
the
follow
matthew
think
not
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
and
the
prophet
i
have
come
not
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfil
them
matthew
for
truli
i
say
to
you
till
heaven
and
earth
pas
away
not
an
iota
not
a
dot
will
pas
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplish
matthew
whoever
then
relax
one
of
the
least
of
these
command
and
teach
men
so
shall
be
call
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
who
doe
them
and
teach
them
shall
be
call
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
matthew
for
i
tell
you
unless
your
righteous
exce
that
of
the
scribe
and
pharise
you
will
never
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
there
are
sever
problem
with
thi
the
most
seriou
is
that
the
law
wa
regard
by
jew
at
the
time
and
now
a
bind
on
jew
but
not
on
gentil
there
are
rule
that
were
bind
on
all
human
be
the
socal
noachic
law
but
they
are
quit
minim
the
issu
that
the
church
had
to
face
after
jesu
death
wa
what
to
do
about
gentil
who
want
to
follow
christ
the
decis
not
to
impos
the
law
on
them
didnt
say
that
the
law
wa
abolish
it
simpli
acknowledg
that
fact
that
it
didnt
appli
to
gentil
thi
is
a
simpl
answer
which
i
think
just
about
everyon
can
agre
to
a
discus
of
the
issu
in
more
or
le
these
term
is
record
in
act
howev
there
more
involv
in
order
to
get
a
full
pictur
of
the
role
of
the
law
we
have
to
come
to
grip
with
paul
appar
reject
of
the
law
and
how
that
relat
to
jesu
commend
of
the
law
at
least
a
i
read
paul
he
say
that
the
law
serv
a
purpos
that
ha
been
in
a
certain
sen
superced
again
thi
issu
isnt
one
of
the
abolit
of
the
law
in
the
middl
of
hi
discus
paul
note
that
he
might
be
understood
thi
way
and
assur
u
that
that
not
what
he
intend
to
say
rather
he
see
the
law
a
primarili
be
present
to
convict
peopl
of
their
sin
but
ultim
it
an
imposs
standard
and
one
that
ha
been
superced
by
christ
paul
comment
are
not
the
world
clearest
here
and
not
everyon
agre
with
my
read
but
the
interest
thing
to
notic
is
that
even
thi
radic
posit
doe
not
entail
an
abolit
of
the
law
it
still
remain
a
an
uncompromis
standard
from
which
not
an
iota
or
dot
may
be
remov
for
it
purpos
of
convict
of
sin
it
import
that
it
not
be
relax
howev
for
christian
it
not
the
end
ultim
we
live
in
faith
not
law
while
the
theoret
categori
they
use
are
rather
differ
in
the
end
i
think
jesu
and
paul
come
to
a
rather
similar
conclus
the
quot
passag
from
mat
should
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
where
jesu
show
u
how
he
interpret
the
law
the
not
an
iota
or
dot
would
suggest
a
rather
liter
read
but
in
fact
that
not
jesu
approach
jesu
interpret
emphas
the
intent
of
the
law
and
stay
away
from
the
ceremoni
detail
inde
he
is
well
known
for
take
a
rather
free
attitud
toward
the
sabbath
and
kosher
law
some
scholar
claim
that
mat
need
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
st
cent
jewish
discus
jesu
accus
hi
oppon
of
care
about
give
a
tenth
of
even
the
most
minor
herb
but
neglect
the
thing
that
realli
matter
justic
merci
and
faith
and
care
about
how
cup
and
plate
are
clean
but
not
about
the
fact
that
insid
the
peopl
who
use
them
are
full
of
extort
and
rapac
mat
thi
and
the
discus
later
in
mat
suggest
that
jesu
ha
a
veri
specif
view
of
the
law
in
mind
and
that
when
he
talk
about
maintain
the
law
in
it
full
strength
he
is
think
of
these
aspect
of
it
paul
conclus
is
similar
while
he
talk
about
the
law
be
superced
all
of
the
specif
exampl
he
give
involv
the
ceremoni
law
such
a
circumcis
and
the
sabbath
he
is
quit
concern
about
maintain
moral
standard
the
net
result
of
thi
is
that
when
paul
talk
about
the
law
be
superced
and
jesu
talk
about
the
law
be
maintain
i
believ
they
are
talk
about
differ
aspect
of
the
law
paul
is
embroil
in
argument
about
circumcis
a
is
natur
in
letter
respond
to
specif
situat
he
look
at
the
aspect
of
the
law
that
is
current
caus
troubl
the
law
a
specif
jewish
ceremoni
he
certainli
doe
not
intend
to
abolish
divin
standard
of
conduct
on
the
other
hand
when
jesu
commend
the
law
he
seem
to
be
talk
the
law
in
it
broadest
implic
for
moral
and
human
relationship
and
deemphas
those
aspect
that
were
later
to
give
paul
so
much
troubl
it
unfortun
that
peopl
use
the
same
term
in
differ
way
but
we
should
be
familiar
with
that
from
current
conflict
look
at
the
way
term
like
famili
valu
take
on
special
mean
from
the
current
context
imagin
some
poor
historian
of
the
futur
tri
to
figur
out
whi
famili
valu
should
be
use
a
a
code
word
for
opposit
to
homosexu
in
one
specif
period
in
the
u
i
think
law
had
taken
on
a
similar
role
in
the
argument
paul
wa
involv
in
paul
wa
clearli
not
reject
all
of
the
jewish
valu
that
go
along
with
the
term
law
ani
more
than
peopl
who
concern
about
the
famili
valu
movement
are
realli
oppos
to
famili
valu
