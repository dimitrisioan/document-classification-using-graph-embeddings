on
our
live
alway
assum
there
is
a
god
of
cours
in
hi
infinit
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectli
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
accord
to
hi
rule
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
let
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creat
everi
one
of
u
directli
or
indirectli
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happen
is
that
he
first
creat
u
and
then
turn
u
lose

i
didnt
ask

make
an
analogu
if

scientist
creat
a
uniqu
live
creatur
which
ha
happen
it
wa
even
patent

a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impos
it
rule
on
u
who
can
tell
if

flock
of
sheep

just
want
to
point
out
that

how
should
one
deal
with
a
man
who
is
convinc
that
he
