of
what

i
present
it
a
inform
for
a
short
summari
a
southern
baptist
name
larri
holli
wrote
a
book
claim
that
freemasonri
is
a
religion
incompat
with
christian
mr
holli
father
reject
christian
and
mr
holli
blame
that
on
the
mason
the
sbc
home
mission
board
includ
an
interfaith
wit
depart
which
studi
other
religion
and
how
to
teach
them
about
christ
a
few
year
ago
they
were
order
to
produc
a
report
on
masonri
they
conclud
that
it
wa
not
a
religion
and
therefor
wa
outsid
their
special
howev
mr
holli
led
a
movement
of
peopl
who
oppos
masonri
and
last
year
the
convent
again
order
the
hmb
to
studi
masonri
i
got
the
feel
that
they
were
say
you
got
the
wrong
answer
last
time
tri
to
do
better
and
get
the
answer
we
want
anyway
there
been
a
bit
of
infight
and
some
inappropri
action
but
the
dust
ha
settl
and
the
report
is
in
nobodi
is
entir
happi
with
it
but
everybodi
seem
will
to
live
with
it
both
side
are
say
thing
such
a
thi
wa
the
best
we
were
go
to
get
in
the
current
environ
the
report
commend
the
mason
for
the
chariti
work
they
do
such
a
the
hospit
and
burn
center
they
oper
a
well
a
effort
to
help
the
elderli
and
prevent
drug
abus
the
report
acknowledg
that
mani
well
known
christian
are
and
have
been
mason
and
note
that
mani
teach
of
masonri
are
support
of
christian
faith
and
practic
exampl
of
the
latter
includ
belief
in
god
emphasi
on
honesti
and
integr
and
that
some
mason
lodg
incorpor
explicit
christian
belief
on
the
other
hand
they
note
that
some
aspect
of
masonri
are
incompat
with
southern
baptist
principl
these
includ
the
use
of
titl
which
some
peopl
consid
sacrilegi
the
take
of
certain
oath
even
though
they
are
not
meant
serious
the
undeni
pagan
andor
occult
write
of
some
mason
leader
the
implic
in
some
mason
write
that
salvat
can
be
achiev
by
good
work
and
the
racial
discrimin
practic
by
mani
mason
lodg
i
note
with
some
chagrin
that
baptist
church
a
a
whole
arent
realli
in
a
place
to
speak
on
thi
last
point
the
report
conclud
that
masonri
is
not
a
religion
and
say
that
membership
should
not
be
endors
or
censur
but
left
to
the
discret
of
individu
thi
wa
in
part
becaus
there
is
variat
among
differ
mason
lodg
and
while
one
may
includ
element
strongli
against
christian
anoth
may
not
mani
southern
baptist
have
strong
convict
about
the
priesthood
of
the
believ
and
the
autonomi
of
the
local
church
and
thi
histori
probabl
influenc
how
the
report
came

today
which
doe
not
have

direct
link
to
a

autonomi
is
a
big
issu
among
some

neither
