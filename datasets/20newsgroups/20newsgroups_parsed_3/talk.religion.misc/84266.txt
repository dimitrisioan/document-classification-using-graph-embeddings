and
from
doxa

doctrin
teach
i
use
orthodox
to
refer
to
right
teach
right

deriv
from
let
god
speak
to
u
through
the
bibl
thi
can
be
from
read
simpl
truth
in
the
scriptur
and
by
use
the
bibl
to
interpret
the
bibl
thank
for
the
etymolog
lesson
but
i
actual
know
what
orthodox
mean
your
avoid
my
question
howev
which
wa
from
what
bodi
of
theolog
doe

version
of
orthodoxi
come

to
simpli
be
say
that
whatev
you
understand
the
bibl
to
say
is
orthodox
ra
who
is
that
hold
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
appar
from
read
the
scriptur
that
are
pertin
you
are
obvious
mistaken
sinc
mani
mani
peopl
have
read
the
bibl
and
mani
do
not
agre
with
you
on
thi
point
onc
again
robert
is
your
interpret
the
onli
correct
or
orthodox
one
ra
whenev
your
person
interpret
of
biblic
passag
is
ra
challeng
your
onli
respons
seem
to
be
that
one
need
mere
to
ra
look
at
the
bibl
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblic
thing
differ
from
you
i
seem
to
be
see
from
you
the
notion
that
ani
differ
in
how
one
view
the
bibl
is
somehow
legitim
except
or
cours
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrari
view
and
perhap
we
can
have
a
discuss
on
that
topic
but
to
decri
someth
that
i
put
forward
without
put
forward
someth
els
to
discu
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
give
credenc
to
other
alleg
view
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simpli
be
contenti
thi
whole
string
began
a
a
respons
to
your
attack
on
mormon
no
one
is
attack
your
person
belief
onli
your
tendenc
to
present
them
a
orthodoxi
i
dont
much
care
what
you
believ
about
the
bibl
just
dont
present
you
person
understand
a
the
onli
orthodox
one
ra
are
we
to
simpli
assum
that
you
are
the
onli
one
who
realli
ra
understand
it
if
you
believ
that
someth
that
i
have
drawn
from
scriptur
is
wrong
then
pleas
show
me
from
scriptur
where
it
is
wrong
simpli
state
that
there
are
other
view
is
not
a
proof
show
it
to
me
from
scriptur
and
then
we
can
go
on
i
have
never
attack
your
specif
belief
that
your
approach
rememb
state
that
other
peopl
who
depend
sole
on
the
bibl
have
other
view
is
inde
proof
that
the
