hello
ceci
my
name
is
toni
and
i
have
a
few
comment
on
your
rosicrucian
adventur
i
herebi
state
that
i
am
not
claim
or
deni
membership
in
ani
order
fratern
etc
with
or
without
the
word
rosicrucian
in
the
name
of
the
organ
i
onli
claim
have
done
some
homework
thi
is
intend
a
a
friendli
articl
and
if
at
time
it
seem
differ
it
my
lack
of
write
skill
show
noth
el
heck
english
may
be
my
second
languag
and
then
again
mayb
not
by
now
i
proceed
i
had
an
ehum
interest
experi
with
the
rosicrucian
or
at
least
rosicrucian
of
some
sort
last
sunday
let
start
with
the
name
rosicrucian
i
took
me
a
long
time
to
come
to
the
conclus
that
there
is
a
differ
between
a
member
of
a
rosicrucian
bodi
and
be
a
rosicrucian
so
when
you
say
that
you
met
some
rosicrucian
you
mean
member
of
a
group
that
call
themselv
rosicrucian
at
least
that
is
what
your
observ
suggest
id
prefer
if
you
would
have
state
up
front
that
it
wa
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
onli
becaus
they
may
be
confus
by
some
reader
of
thi
newsgroup
with
the
rosicrucian
order
amorc
base
the
usa
jurisdict
in
san
jose
ca
thi
be
the
rc
org
with
the
most
member
last
time
i
look
of
cours
most
member
doe
not
necessarili
mean
best
anyway
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
claim
they
descend
at
least
in
part
from
what
wa
the
goldundrosenkreuz
golden
and
rosi
cross
from
the
th
centuri
there
were
two
golden
and
rosi
cross
the
first
chronolog
more
alchem
the
second
with
mason
ting
but
their
histori
is
the
subject
of
a
complet
chapter
youll
have
to
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
that
lectureclasswhatev
had
been
present
by
amorc
it
is
unlik
that
you
would
have
had
the
same
impress
ie
youd
probabl
have
had
a
posit
impress
more
like
than
a
neg
one
imho
the
first
guy
also
said
that
the
r
are
a
mystic
christian
order
and
that
they
base
their
teach
on
the
teach
of
the
kathar
english
from
the
thirteenth
centuri
again
instead
of
r
it
should
be
lectorium
rosicrucianum
it
is
curiou
to
know
that
other
rc
order
in
the
usa
claim
to
be
non
sectarian
the
cathar
were
a
heret
christian
sect
that
directli
challeng
the
author
of
the
mediev
cathol
church
they
flourish
dure
the
th
centuri
centuri
which
saw
the
religi
zeal
express
in
the
crusad
and
also
the
grow
disillus
with
the
cathol
church
and
the
worldli
way
of
it
cleric
it
wa
larg
in
respons
to
the
church
unseemli
pomp
and
splendor
that
cathar
took
root
first
in
northern
itali
then
throughout
the
south
of
franc
what
made
me
a
bit
suspici
wa
the
way
they
first
said
that
we
all
contain
someth
divin
and
could
find
our
way
back
to
divin
then
that
we
couldnt
becom
divin
a
the
person
we
are
current
but
if
we
work
realli
hard
we
would
reach
etern
bliss
i
dont
see
noth
fundament
wrong
with
u
contain
someth
divin
and
ye
i
dont
like
phrase
like
etern
bliss
either
