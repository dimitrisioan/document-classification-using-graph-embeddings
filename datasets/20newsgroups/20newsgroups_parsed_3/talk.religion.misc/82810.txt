the

mr

such

oh

my

your
misquot
of

are
astound
dave
read
the
begin
of
thi
part
of
my
respons
to
see
what
i
realli
said
in
my
post
of
thi
articl
actual
mr
decenso
you
said
that
there
wa
benefit
to
our
argument
in
that
it
caus
to
to
rediscov
bulling
exegisi
i
did
not
realiz
that
you
would
find
such
garbag
benefici
unless
you
were
convinc
by
it
my
repli
thank
you
for
correct
your
restat
of
my
point
db
and
mr
decenso
also
repli
dave
these
are
not
necessarili
my
view
they
are
bulling
we
will
discu
the
land
issu
in
later
post
im
sure
im
onli
respond
to
thi
one
you
have
direct
re
bulling
view
becaus
it
enjoy
thu
i
apolog
for
think
that
even
mr
decenso
could
find
such
drek
convincingh
should
specifi
which
part
of
bulling
he
find
convinc
and
quit
hide
behind
a
disingenu
mask
of
thi
is
what
bulling
believ
not
necessarili
what
i
believ
so
which
is
it
mr
decenso
do
you
find
the
exegisi
convinc
or
not
my
repli
one
of
my
purpos
in
debat
these
alleg
contradict
with
you
and
other
is
to
disemin
mani
differ
view
of
possibl
reconcili
rais
by
variou
bibl
scholar
and
student
alik
when
i
present
my
view
i
will
clearli
distinguish
them
from
now
on
db
of
cours
without
archer
and
bulling
we
find
that
mr
decenso
ha
present
no
greek
exegisi
at
all
and
mr
decenso
ha
made
a
big
thing
about
my
not
refer
back
to
the
actual
greek
thu
we
find
thi
demand
on
hi
part
for
qualiti
greek
exegisi
to
be
a
hypocrit
requir
my
repli
good
point
but
in
your
declar
that
these
passag
are
contradictori
you
have
produc
onli
superfici
reason
and
observ
nor
have
you
dug
deeper
im
glad
you
have
begun
in
thi
post
i
will
begin
greek
studi
on
these
passag
in
more
depth
than
i
thought
necessari
a
well
db
it
would
be
appropri
to
look
at
what
mr
decenso
ha
actual
use
a
evid
now
we
know
what
he
claim
for
a
standard
a
he
ha
state

often

are

let
see
he
ha

and
sinc
he
is
tri
to
reconcil
it
to

we
see
that
he
ha
also

on

rememb
archer
and
bulling
dont

thu
we
find
hi
vaunt
criterion
for
exegisi
is
just
empti
mouth
my
repli
question
do
you
find
such
criterion
import
if
so
do
you
plan
on
start
to
use
them
to
the
best
of
your
abil
or
will
you
continu
to
present
shallow
observ
i
dont
mean
thi
in
a
bad
way
at
thi
point
in
our
debat
i
have
not
found
it
necessari
to
present
a
total
exeget
analysi
of
these
passag
sinc
we
seem
to
keep
beat
around
the
bush
and
not
get
into
the
core
of
the
vers
i
do
not
believ
it
necessari
to
use
mani
of
the
abov
criterion
to
refut
your
argument
re
juda
in
act
and
matthew
but
i
will
do
my
best
from
thi
point
on
to
use
sever
of
the
abov
criterion
sinc
you
desir
me
to
i
hope
you
will
also
it
will
greatli
enhanc
our
studi
of
these
passag
db
the
onli
thing
he
ha
actual
use
beyond
the
passag
itself
is
ani
other
passag
thu
mr
decenso
should
be
honest
and
note
that
most
of
hi
list
is
red
her
and
hi
onli
real
criterion
seem
to
be
a
the
text
itself
b
parallel
passag
my
repli
the
reason
is
simpley
are
mistat
the
passag
you
claim
that
the
passag
contradict
one
anoth
i
do
not
see
the
passag
contradict
one
anoth
they
may
veri
well
be
complimentari
a
mani
scholarli
sourc
mention
matthew
may
not
be
present
juda
death
a
you
claim
but
well
look
at
your
defens
of
thi
later
also
the
reward
of
iniqu
in
the
act
passag
may
not
be
the
piec
of
silver
in
matthew
passag
although
you
have
a
valiant
attempt
later
at
state
whi
you
believ
it
is
at
thi
begin
stage
in
our
debat
we
are
lay
some
scriptur
groundwork
which
will
be
expand
upon
through
deeper
exegesi
db
of
cours
the
onli
reason
i
can
see
to
so
drastic
reinterpret
a
passag
a
he
ha
done
with
juda
death
is
to
make
it
agre
with
anoth
passag
so
that
both
could
be
consid
correct
my
repli
one
of
the
reason
i
have
given
a
differ
exeget
view
of
the
passag
is
that
you
seem
to
think
the
major
of
scholarship
is
wrong
in
conclud
these
passag
are
complimentari
howev
i
see
no
problem
in
toni
rose
explan
of
juda
death
how
would
you
explain
the
inaccuraci
between
juda
hang
himself
in
matthew
and
fall
headlong
he
burst
open
thi
question
of
the
manner
in
which
juda
die
is
one
with
which
we
are
constantli
confront
in
our
travel
mani
peopl
point
to
the
appar
discrep
in
the
two
account
a
an
obviou
irreconcil
error
some
have
gone
so
far
a
to
say
that
the
idea
of
an
inerr
bibl
is
destroy
by
these
contradictori
account
howev
thi
is
not
the
case
at
all
matthew
relat
that
juda
hang
himself
while
peter
tell
u
he
fell
and
wa
crush
by
the
impact
the
two
statement
are
inde
differ
but
do
they
necessarili
contradict
each
other
matthew
doe
not
say
that
juda
did
not
fall
neither
doe
peter
say
that
juda
did
not
hang
himself
thi
is
not
a
matter
of
one
person
call
someth
black
and
the
other
person
call
it
white
both
account
can
be
true
and
supplementari
a
possibl
reconstruct
would
be
thi
juda
hang
himself
on
a
tree
on
the
edg
of
a
precipic
that
overlook
the
valley
of
hinnom
after
he
hung
there
for
some
time
the
limb
of
the
tree
snap
or
the
rope
gave
way
and
juda
fell
down
the
ledg
mangl
hi
bodi
in
the
process
the
fall
could
have
been
befor
or
after
death
a
either
would
fit
thi
explan
thi
possibl
is
entir
natur
when
the
terrain
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
examin
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
you
can
see
rocki
terrac
to
foot
in
height
and
almost
perpendicular
there
are
still
tree
around
the
ledg
and
a
rocki
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefor
it
is
easi
to
conclud
that
juda
struck
one
of
the
jag
rock
on
thi
way
down
tear
hi
bodi
open
it
is
import
to
rememb
that
we
are
not
told
how
long
juda
remain

from
the
tree

how
advanc
wa

at

head
he
then
pull
the
trigger
and
leap
from
the
window
at
the
same
time
on
the
other
hand
a
person
could
say
that
thi
man
took
hi
life
by
shoot
himself
while
anoth
could
rightli
contend
he
commit
suicid
by
jump
form
the

in
thi
case
both
are
true
a
both
are
true
in

account
of
the

it
is
mere
a

clearli
reject

that
doesnt
tell

it

misinform
whi
do

i
do
not
think
you
have
ever
told
u
what
you
believ
in
thi
respect
db
at

though
mr
decenso
onli
ask
two
question
of
me
you
claim
act
and
matthew
contradict
one
anoth
in
repres
juda
death
i
ask
you
again
to
provid
evid
that
matthew
state
juda
die
in
the
hang
you
claim
that
the
piec
of
silver
in
matthew
that
juda
threw
down
in
the
templ
and
the
chief
priest
use
is
the
reward
of
iniqu
in
act
that
pictur
juda
in
some

purchas
a
field
with
therefor
there
is
a
contradict
prove
that
the
piec
of
silver
and
the
reward
of
iniqu
are
one
and
the
same
actual
i
find
question
to
be
a
rather
stupid
request
but
i
will
answer
it
becaus
he
now
restrict
himself
to
two
point
first
i
would
point
out
that
hang
is
a
veri
effici
manner
for
end
a
life
in
fact
it
is
a
bit
of
a
fluke
when
someon
surviv
hang
except
in

cowboy
movi
and
even
then
it
usual
refer
to
a
an

my
repli
i
work

that
investig
child
abus
and
neglect
today
i
got
a
call
re
a
child
that
attempt
suicid
by
hang
himself
becaus
hi
mother
is
on

he
fail
in
hi
attempt
and
is
in
a
child
psych
ward
at
a
local
hospit
hang
attempt
are
not
alway
success
to
assum
that
becaus
most
hang
are
success
thi
one
wa
also
is
beg
the
question
if
i
may
quot
you
last

listen
to

teach
compar
religion
and

it
wa
interest
db
thi
is
so
preval
that
so
that
to
say
a

is
synonym
with

my

thi
is
onli
one
of

here
we
have
no

we

also
there
is
noth
in

mr

you

my

reput
you

one
that
have
never
er
a

a
insist
that
the

wa
unsuccess
that
cant
be
done
even
by
me
a
i
said
in
an
earlier
post
although
i
still
agre
with
toni
exegesi
a
be
the
most
probabl
explan
regard
juda
death
take
into
account
sever
criterion
ive
recent
notic
some
new

in
matthew
mat
then
he
threw
down
the
piec
of
silver
in
the
templ
and
depart
and
went
and
hang
himself
but
the
chief
priest
took
the
silver
piec
and
said
it
is
not
law
to
put
them
into
the
treasuri
becaus
they
are
the
price
of
blood
and
they
consult
togeth
and
bought
with
them
the
potter
field
to
buri
stranger
in
therefor
that
field
ha
been
call
the
field
of
blood
to
thi
day
first
of
all
notic
that
the
text
doe
not
say
that
juda
die
a
a
result
of

all
it
say
is
that
he
went
and
hang
himself
luke
howev
in

tell
u
that
and
fall
headlong
he
burst

in

all
hi

thi
is
a

clear
indic
along
with
the
other
detail
given
in
act
peter
speech
the
need
to
pick
a
new
apostl
etc
that
at
least
after
juda
fall
he
wa
dead
so
the
whole
concept
that
matthew
and
luke
both
recount
juda
death
is
highli
probabl
but
not
clear
cut
i
also
wrote
my

here
we
have
a

that
i

i

i
have

and
they
said
what
is
that
to
u
you
see
to

then
he
threw

matthew

and
let
anoth
take
hi
offic
here
we
may
have
a
graphic
explan
of
juda
deathso
my
line
of
reason
to
dispel
your
contradict
myth
reth
two
account
of
juda
death
is
thismatthew
doesnt
necessarili
explain
how
juda
die
he
doe
say
juda
hang
himself
but
he
didnt
specif
say
juda
die
in
the
hang
incid
howev
act
seem
to
show
u
hi
graphic
demis
therefor
there
is
no
contradict
between
matthew
and
act
re
juda
death
my
repli
we
do
know
from
matthew
that
he
did
hang
himself
and
act
probabl
record
hi
death
although
it
possibl
and
plausibl
that
he
fell
from
the
hang
and
hit
some
rock
therebi
burst
open
i
can
no
longer
assum
that
to
be
the
case
therefor
no
contradict
matthew
did
not
say
juda
die
a
a
result
of
the
hang
did
he
most
scholar
believ
he
probabl
did
but
i
quot
all
that
to
show
that
i
highli
regard
the
scholar
explan
but
in
look
at
the
text
initi
we
cant
assum
juda
die
it
is
howev
highli
probabl
db
by
the
way
while
all
agre
that
juda
die
from
the
hang
the
book
had
differ
way
of
deal
with
the
contradict
we
are
discuss
one
simpli
ignor
it
entir
and
simpli
refer
back
to
matthew
version
a
the
correct
version
in
both
matt
and
act
the
biblic
knowledg
commentari
suggest
the
hypothesi
that
juda
hung
and
then
when
he
rot
hi
belli
explod
which
doesnt
explain
hi
headlong
fall
or
that
hi
branch
or
rope
broke
and
he
fell
to
hi
death
and
hi
gut
gush
out
which
doesnt
explain
how
a
hang
man
would
fall
headlong
rather
than
foot
first
my
repli
the
outcom
of
ani
fall
is
depend
upon
mani
factorshow
high
the
person
wa
suspend
befor
the
fall
ani
obstruct
such
a
tree
branch
that
may
have
deviat
the
fall
how
steep
an
inclin
of
rocki
surfac
the
victim
fell
upon
thu
possibl
roll
or
bounc
of
sever
rock
etc
in
a
superfici
examin
of
the
act
passag
and
the
matthew
passag
we
are
not
given
a
lot
of
info
on
the
geograph
specif
but
toni
in
the
abov
quot
post
gave
u
some
a
possibl
reconstruct
would
be
thi
juda
hang
himself
on
a
tree
on
the
edg
of
a
precipic
that
overlook
the
valley
of
hinnom
after
he
hung
there
for
some
time
the
limb
of
the
tree
snap
or
the
rope
gave
way
and
juda
fell
down
the
ledg
mangl
hi
bodi
in
the
process
the
fall
could
have
been
befor
or
after
death
a
either
would
fit
thi
explan
thi
possibl
is
entir
natur
when
the
terrain
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
examin
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
you
can
see
rocki
terrac
to
foot
in
height
and
almost
perpendicular
there
are
still
tree
around
the
ledg
and
a
rocki
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefor
it
is
easi
to
conclud
that
juda
struck
one
of
the
jag
rock
on
thi
way
down
tear
hi
bodi
open
db
now
truth
i
do
not
see
what
is
comfort
about
matthew
confus
the
sourc
of
the
potter
field
prophesi
but
on
the
other
hand
the
author
is
correct
matthew
doe
make
that
confus
of
cours
a
biblic
inerrantist
who
claim
that
everi
word
of
the
bibl
is
guarante
true
by
god
will
have
to
therebi
add
one
more
contradict
to
the
death
of
juda
ie
where
the
prophesi
of
the
potter
field
came
from
my
repli
pleas
when
we
are
done
with
thi
studi
on
hi
death
remind
me
to
discu
thi
with
you
db
a
to
your
second
question
mr
decenso
you
ask
how
we
could
be
sure
that
the
money
with
which
juda
purchas
the
land
wa
inde
for
the
betray
rather
than
some
other
sourc
i
would
point
out
that
in
act
where
it
specif
mention
the
reward
of
iniqu
act
it
also
specif
mention
what
act
of
iniqu
they
were
talk
about
ie
act
concern
juda
who
wa
guid
to
those
who
arrest
jesu
now
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
bibl
describ
an
act
of
iniqu
and
then
immedi
discu
the
reward
of
iniqu
it
would
be
rather
inan
to
suggest
that
it
wa
an
action
of
iniqu
other
than
the
one
discuss
my
repli
dave
we
are
get
somewher
arent
we
act
and
in
those
day
peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
discipl
altogeth
the
number
of
name
wa
about
a
hundr
and
twenti
and
said
act
men
and
brother
thi
scriptur
had
to
be
fulfil
which
the
holi
spirit
spoke
befor
by
the
mouth
of
david
concern
juda
who
becam
a
guid
to
those
who
arrest
jesu
act
for
he
wa
number
with
u
and
obtain
a
part
in
thi
ministri
act
now
thi
man
purchas
a
field
with
the
wage
of
iniqu
and
fall
headlong
he
burst
open
in
the
middl
and
all
hi
entrail
gush
out
act
and
it
becam
known
to
all
those
dwell
in
jerusalem
so
that
field
is
call
in
their
own
languag
akel
dama
that
is
field
of
blood
act
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
psalm
let
hi
dwell
place
be
desol
and
let
no
one
live
in
it
and
let
anoth
take
hi
offic
notic
that
in
vers
the
word
iniqu
is
not
use
rather
it
state
that
juda
becam
a
guid
to
those
who
arrest
jesu
but
the
writer
did
not
stop
therev
for
he
wa
number
with
u
and
obtain
a
part
in
thi
ministri
what
part
did
juda
play
in
their
ministri
joh
thi
he
said
not
that
he
care
for
the
poor
but
becaus
he
wa
a
thief
and
had
the
money
box
and
he
use
to
take
what
wa
put
in
it
joh
for
some
thought
becaus
juda
had
the
money
box
that
jesu
had
said
to
him
buy
those
thing
we
need
for
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
someth
to
the
poor
so
now
we
know
what
part
juda
play
he
wa
a
treasur
per
se
right
after
peter
state
that
juda
play
a
part
in
thi
ministri
treasur
accord
to
john
then
luke
add
the
parenthet
explan
of
wage
of
iniqu
money
that
should
have
been
put
into
the
ministri
but
wa
stolen
by
juda
to
purchas
a
field
i
believ
thi
is
a
better
exeget
explan
of
what
the
wage
of
iniqu
are
what
do
you
think
dave
db
now
sinc
i
have
given
you
clear
answer
and
even
refer
perhap
you
could
unequivoc
state
what
type
of
inerrantist
you
are
instead
of
ask
me
what
type
i
think
you
are
a
you
did
to
mr
joslin
my
repli
i
will
gladli
admit
that
i
am
a
complet
inerrantist
although
i
do
not
have
that
big
a
problem
with
the
limit
inerr
view
frank
if
one
wish
to
contend
with
him
he
could
not
answer
him
one
time
out
of
a
thousand
job
