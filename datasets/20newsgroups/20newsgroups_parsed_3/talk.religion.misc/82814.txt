eg
the

make

to
put

implicitli
denot
a

ie

so
while
the

specif
denot
a

a

thu
robinson
is
quit
specif
when
he
state
that
it
mean
to
hang

to
end

he
then
note
the
the
use
of
apacgw
in

to
denot
context
he
present
that
exampl
of
apacgw
a
be
use
to
explicitli
mean
suicid
by
hang
now
sinc
there
is
a
perfectli
good
word
for
strangl
without
the
ad
denot
of
death
and
a
you
insist
that
the
bibl
wa
written
by
god
and
everi
word
is
precic
correct
you
are
stuck
with
the
complet
mean
of
apacgw
ie
sinc
the
word
apacgw
wa
use
then
death
is
denot
a
the
result
by
the
way
i
note
that
mr
decenso
also
present
an
exampl
of
apacgw
in
the
septuagint
the
greek
translat
of
the
ot
use
at
the
time
of
jesu
it
onli
use
in
samuel
now
when
ahithophel
saw
that
hi
advic
wa
not
follow
he
saddl
a
donkey
and
aros
and
went
home
to
hi
hous
to
hi
citi
then
he
put
hi
household
in
order
and
hang
himself
and
die
and
he
wa
buri
in
hi
father
tomb
notic
that
not
onli
is
it
state
that
ahithophel
hang
himself
gr
sept
apagcho
but
it
explicitli
add
and
die
here
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
result
in
matthew
we
are
not
explicitli
told
juda
die
note
mr
decenso
a
you
say
the
septuagint
wa
a
translat
from
hebrew
to
greek
and
you
have
not
shown
the
origin
mean
of
the
hebrew
ie
the
the
hebrew
say
and
die
and
thu
whether
it
wa
simpli
echo
in
the
greek
it
should
also
be
point
out
that
regardless
of
the
ad
and
die
the
correct
translat
would
still
be
apacgw
a
the
man
did
inde
die
from
strangul
redund
but
correct
further
we
have
evid
that
the
septuagint
wa
repeatedli
rewritten
and
reedit
which
includ
version
which
contradict
each
other
and
such
edit
wa
not
even
necessarili
execut
by
greek
thu
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can
use
the
septuagint
a
it
now
stand
a
a
paragon
of
ancient
greek
so
what
you
realli
need
to
prove
your
point
mr
decenso
is
an
exampl
in
ancient
greek
of
someon
commit
apacgw
and
surviv
otherwis
i
would
see
you
a
simpli
make
worthless
assert
without
correspond
evid
now
i
would
note
mr
decenso
that
everytim
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
research
it
one
of
your
appar
contriv
exegisi
i
pretti
much
find
it
fals
thu
i
think
that
if
you
are
go
to
add
to
the
text
someth
over
and
abov
what
the
sourc
clearli
say
then
you
had
better
have
an
explicit
greek
or
histor
sourc
to
justifi
it
by
the
way
a
to
mr
rose
statement
about
tree
around
the
potter
field
there
are
still
tree
around
the
ledg
and
a
rocki
pavement
at
the
bottom
unless
mr
rose
can
show
that
these
tree
are
two
thousand
year
old
or
that
there
are
year
old
stump
there
or
ha
a
thousand
year
old
descript
of
the
area
which
mention
such
tree
then
it
is
inappropri
for
him
to
assert
that
the
present
placement
of
tree
prove
the
locat
of
the
tree
two
thousand
year
ago
after
all
thing
chang
now
a
to
your
other
argument
ie
that
the
money
juda
use
is
not
the
same
a
the
silver
a
to
your
second
question
mr
decenso
you
ask
how
we
could
be
sure
that
the
money
with
which
juda
purchas
the
land
wa
inde
for
the
betray
rather
than
some
other
sourc
i
would
point
out
that
in
act
where
it
specif
mention
the
reward
of
iniqu
act
it
also
specif
mention
what
act
of
iniqu
they
were
talk
about
ie
act
concern
juda
who
wa
guid
to
those
who
arrest
jesu
now
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
bibl
describ
an
act
of
iniqu
and
then
immedi
discu
the
reward
of
iniqu
it
would
be
rather
inan
to
suggest
that
it
wa
an
action
of
iniqu
other
than
the
one
discuss
notic
that
in
vers
the
word
iniqu
is
not
use
rather
it
state
that
juda
becam
a
guid
to
those
who
arrest
jesu
but
the
writer
did
not
stop
therev
for
he
wa
number
with
u
and
obtain
a
part
in
thi
ministri
what
part
did
juda
play
in
their
ministri
true
peter
or
the
author
of
act
doe
not
specif
call
juda
betray
an
iniqu
but
for
that
matter
neither
doe
john
specif
call
juda
action
an
iniqu
either
further
john
did
not
say
that
juda
took
the
money
box
but
rather
said
some
thought
that
becaus
juda
had
the
money
box
jesu
wa
tell
him
buy
what
we
need
for
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
someth
to
the
poor
so
after
receiv
the
morsel
he
immedi
went
out
and
it
wa
night
note
that
it
is
said
that
juda
left
it
doe
not
say
that
he
took
the
money
box
thu
when
i
see
your
explan
it
still
seem
to
me
you
would
choos
the
a
an
unproven
iniqu
mention
by
anoth
author
in
a
differ
book
written
at
a
differ
time
over
the
iniqu
explicitli
mention
by
the
author
of
act
i
find
thi
forc
and
contriv
of
cours
thi
particular
argument
becom
moot
sinc
we
have
have
seen
evid
that
apacgw
mean
suicid
you
see
sinc
juda
hang
wa
success
he
could
not
have
spent
the
money
mention
in
john
becaus
matthew
and
mark
explicitli
say
the
betray
wa
on
the
high
holi
day
ie
passov
and
thu
he
could
not
have
spent
the
money
befor
kill
himself
the
next
day
thu
the
money
which
bought
the
field
of
blood
would
have
to
have
been
the
piec
of
silver
of
cours
he
got
the
piec
of
silver
that
night
a
well
and
thu
couldnt
have
spent
that
either
oh
dear
i
believ
that
the
hous
of
card
is
com
down
mayb
we
should
at
thi
point
discu
now
whether
jesu
wa
crucifi
on
friday
or
saturday
a
that
is
now
part
of
the
argument
about
juda
by
the
way
a
to
where
the
prophesi
of
the
potter
field
came
from
ie
the
mention
of
it
in
matthew
you
say
pleas
when
we
are
done
with
thi
studi
on

remind
me
to
discu
thi
with
you
i
am
remind
you
now
to
discu
it
now
it
all
part

vers
we
are
discuss
and
i
wish
you
would
quit
procrastin

sidestep
these
issu
