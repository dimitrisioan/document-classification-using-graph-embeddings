that
believ
becaus
our
testimoni
among
you
wa
believ
in
that
day
kinda
give
flame
a
whole
new
mean
i
reckon
the
impress
i
got
from
talk
with
livingston
wa
that
the
come
of
the
lord
powerwis
is
go
to
be
someth
that
those
who
are
unprepar
cant
handl
kinda
like
overload
a
fuse
due
to
guilt
somehow
it
seem
to
also
appli
to
the
entir
physic
world
a
we
know
it
lf
suggest
that
god
doesnt
want
that
and
ha
sent
koresh
a
a
remind
seem
that
those
who
have
been
purifi
through
salvat
or
that
those
protect
by
the
seal
will
be
the
one
who
surviv
and
no
i
dont
have
a
good
idea
yet
what
be
shield
by
the
seal
actual
involv
or
how
exactli
it
relat
to
salvat
other
than
it
involv
the
marriag
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
for
those
of
you
biblic
well
vers
me
person
im
total
depend
on
god
through
christ
so
if
god
want
me
to
understand
good
if
not
also
good
if
god
want
to
save
me
or
dispos
of
me
that
great
either
way
be
born
in
the
spirit
mean
be
part
of
the
bodi
of
christ
ephesian
so
who
and
what
i
wa
matter
littl
what
import
is
love
god
come
nova
nuke
or
apocalyps
who
care
satan
might
even
be
abl
to
pull
off
a
pretti
convinc
fake
big
deal
not
worth
fear
or
worri
about
though
not
befor
the
greater
glori
of
god
mayb
koresh
is
right
mayb
he
isnt
and
it
should
be
interest
to
see
the
new
messag
or
propheci
the
tour
of
the
bibl
ive
taken
in
studi
the
passag
he
point
to
in
the
text
ha
been
most
re
ward
but
the
test
of
propheci
is
still
the
fruit
it
bear
which
is
not
yet
clear
much
much
more
import
is
chariti
which
by
definit
is
love
for
god
i
hope
dear
reader
youv
taken
all
thi
a
an
express
of
faith
and
not
a
statement
of
mere
fact
seem
mani
