here
ti
someon
just
told
me
that
the
old
testament
book
were
translat
into
greek
a
long
time
ago
ye
that
a
famou
version
call
the
septuagint
it
wa
a
translat
made
by
greek
jew
and
that
the
origin
were
destroy
in
a
fire
soon
afterward
no
i
dont
know
what
your
refer
to
here
when
the
jersusalem
templ
wa
destroy
some
manuscript
may
have
been
lost
but
i
think
our
extant
hebrew
manuscript
are
a
good
a
our
greek
one
i
dont
know
about
ani
origin
the
person
who
wa
tell
me
about
the
septuagint
version
said
that
the
greek
had
a
wonder
librari
in
alexandria
that
wa
full
of
manuscriptsscrol
and
that
it
wa
burn
soon
after
the
septuagint
version
wa
translat
perhap
to
conceal
some
chang
in
the
differ
version
or
perhap
just
a
part
of
the
typic
burn
of
valuabl
thing
that
occur
dure
chang
in
power
group
hei
dunno
no
the
librari
at
alexandria
wa
perhap
the
greatest
librari
ever
built
in
the
world
the
greek
had
a
love
of
wisdom
philo
sopho
and
thi
great
love
wa
reflect
in
the
alexandrian
librari
the
christian
got
a
hold
of
it
and
began
modifi
and
purg
text
and
then
the
moslem
invad
and
either
the
christian
burn
the
librari
to
keep
it
from
fall
into
moslem
hand
far
more
like
sinc
they
were
the
book
burner
not
the
moslem
or
it
burn
in
the
sack
of
the
citi
or
the
moslem
burn
it
either
way
a
tremend
amount
of
inform
wa
lost
the
destruct
of
the
librari
of
alexandria
wa
probabl
one
of
the
greatest
crime
of
man
against
man
so
i
wa
just
wonder
sinc
i
imagin
some
jewish
peopl
somewher
must
have
had
copi
of
the
earlier
hebrew
version
is
the
hebrew
version
of
the
old
testament
veri
differ
from
the
greek
deriv
version
no
there
are
a
few
famou
discrep
isaiah
propheci
about
a
young
woman
wa
chang
into
a
virgin
which
wa
how
the
new
testament
writer
read
it
but
not
mani
actual
the
hebrew
almah
young
woman
wa
translat
a
the
hellenist
greek
partheno
which
may
or
may
not
be
correctli
translat
into
the
modern
and
technic
english
term
virgin
the
jew
did
not
have
the
type
of
virgin
cult
that
the
grecoroman
had
in
artemi
and
diana
well
perhap
thi
is
the
answer
then
delet
if
you
go
to
a
jewish
bookstor
youll
get
a
bibl
translat
by
jew
so
there
will
be
some
differ
in
interpret
but
the
text
theyr
translat
from
is
basic
the
same
the
standard
text
use
by
christian
and
jew
is
the
masoret
text
jew
of
cours
use
the
text
in
it
origin
hebrew
without
translat
if
you
want
to
read
the
origin
you
can
buy
an
interlinear
bibl
that
contain
the
hebrew
old
testament
and
the
greek
new
testament
with
an
english
translat
written
underneath
each
word
if
you
want
a
bibl
with
a
possiblymoreorigin
basic
text
you
can
tri
to
find
a
samaritan
bibl
good
luck
ive
never
seen
one
the
samaritan
no
not
the
good
samaritan
have
their
own
version
of
the
book
of
mose
they
claim
the
jewish
bibl
wa
alter
by
ezra
propaganda
thank
for
the
tip
now
i
just
have
to
find
someon
to
teach
me
samaritan
just
me
littl
e
so
is
a
good
samaritan
