i
am
hardli
paranoid
i
am
just
not
expect
too
much
from
a
secular

that
may
not

our
valu
and
faith
and
which
inde
a

bogg
et

may
be
out
to

destroy
u
a
a
matter
of
fact
propheci
in
my
church
indic
that
in
futur
year
global
persecut
against
mormon
will
so
increas
in
intens
and
scope
that
paraphras
all
those
who
wish
to
escap
persecut
and
murder
must
flee
to
zion
zion
the
pure
in
heart
will
be
reestablish
in
those
day
and
it
aint
our
current
secular
author
who
will
rule
over
it
david
koresh
did
not
pose
a
great
threat
to
the
feder
author
or
the
secur
of
thi
nation
and
with
john
i
too
wonder
who
or
what
next
i
person
feel
that
we
should
tri
to
stop
anyon
who
is
a
threat
to
the
life
of
even
one
person
sure
he
did
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
secur
of
thi
nation
but
he
did
pose
a
threat
to
the
live
of
hi
follow
that
much
is
definit
hmmm
definit
by
whom
until
such
ha
been
establish
beyond
reason
abl
doubt
thi
alleg
threat
may
have
been
le
than
the
threat
impos
upon
him
and
hi
follow
by
the
batf
and
fbi
who
kill
who
what
constitut
right
did
the
atf
offic
have
to
invad
upon
privat
land
and
to
forc
themselv
into
the
compound
what
realli
caus
the
murder
of
the
littl
child
could
it
be
that
the
atffbi
presenc
ha
ani
bear
upon
the
event
how
would
you
interpret
the
mt
masada
event
blame
the
jew
what
the
heck
did
the
roman
do
there
anyway
what
busi
did
the
atffbi
ha
in
waco
texa
the
branch
davidian
never
pose
ani
threat
to
societi
thi
is
like
ask
who
realli
caus
the
death
of
the
isra
olymp
team
in
in
that
case
the
polic
botch
the
job
a
well
but
to
lay
a
heavier
burden
on
them
than
the
terrorist
would
be
a
terribl
mistak
i
think
the
same
sort
of
reason
appli
in
thi
case
certainli
if
david
koresh
chose
ani
peac
option
the
atf
and
fbi
would
have
compli
the
respons
is
more
hi
than
the
author
come
now
at
issu
is
in
how
much
the
author
escal
an
otherwis
peac
standoff
let
get
it
over
with
and
forc
david
koresh
to
come
out
by
gas
them
were
they
naiv
or
what
they
play
right
into
the
hand
of
an
apocalypticthink
individu
he
had
prepar
hi
peopl
for
thi
eventu
for
year
and
not
one
firetruck
or
plan
wa
in
place
to
deal
with
thi
scenario
i
feel
that
the
author
had
some
respons
to
protect
their
own
citizen
even
if
they
were
religi
zealot
and
guilti
of
not
pay
a
gun
licens
ha
the
batf
becom
an
extens
of
the
local
taxcollector
david
koresh
no
doubt
will
be
describ
a
the
evil
guy
by
the
execution
while
the
action
of
all
those
valiant
and
brave
offic
character
the
atffbi
a
execution
is
inaccur
and
unfair
in
order
to
be
an
execution
the
least
one
must
have
done
is
have
the
intent
to
kill
que
intrus
into
privat
properti
with
semi
load
with
life
ammunit
isnt
that
implicit
intent
or
at
least
prepar
to
kill
i
ask
you
would
the
batf
warrant
stand
up
in
a
civil
court
of
justic
i
do
not
mind
if
crimin
such
a

drug
lord
are
brought
