such
a

should
be

widespread
doubt
about
the

especi
hi
book
the

it
is
clear
to
me
that
black
hole
are
noth
more
than
mathemat
fantasi
the
strang
object
at
cygnu
x
is
just
an
unusu
massiv
white
dwarf
star
not
the
black
hole
that
orthodox
astronom
and
physicist
so
badli
want
to
prove
their
theori
by
the
way
i
do
not
understand
whi
so
much
public
is
be
given
to
physicist
stephen
hawk
the
physicist
and
astronom
seem
to
be
act
a
if
hawk
sever
physic
problem
somehow
make
him
wiser
it
doe
not
i
wish
the
same
attent
had
been
given
to
physicist
dewey
b
larson
while
he
wa
still
aliv
widespread
public
and
attent
should
now
be
given
to
larson
theori
book
and
organ
the
intern
societi

scienc
electromagnet
propuls
i
heard
of
that
concept
mani
year
ago
in
connect
with
ufo
and
unorthodox
inventor
but
i
never
wa
abl
to
find
out
how
or
whi
they
work
or
how
they
are
construct
i
found
a
possibl
clue
about
whi
they
might
work
on
page
of
the
book
basic
properti
of
matter
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
which
describ
part
of
larson
comprehens

i
quot
one
paragraph
a
indic
in
the
preced
chapter
the
develop
of
the
theori
of
the
univers
of
motion
arriv
at
a
total
differ
concept
of
the
natur
of
electr
resist
the
electron
we
find
are
deriv
from
the
environ
it
wa
brought
out
in
volum
i
larson
book
noth
but
motion
that
there
are
physic
process
in
oper
which
produc
electron
in
substanti
quantiti
and
that
although
the
motion
that
constitut
these
electron
are
in
mani
case
absorb
by
atom
structur
the
opportun
for
util
thi
type
of
motion
in
such
structur
are
limit
it
follow
that
there
is
alway
a
larg
excess
of
free
electron
in
the
materi
sector
materi
half
of
the
univers
most
of
which
are
uncharg
in
thi
uncharg
state
the
electron
can
not
move
with
respect
to
extens
space
becaus
they
are
inher
rotat
unit
of
space
and
the
relat
of
space
to
space
is
not
motion
in
open
space
therefor
each
uncharg
electron
remain
perman
in
the
same
locat
with
respect
to
the
natur
refer
system
in
the
manner
of
a
photon
in
the
context
of
the
stationari
spatial
refer
system
the
uncharg
electron
like
the
photon
is
carri
outward
at
the
speed
of
light
by
the
progress
of
the
natur
refer
system
all
materi
aggreg
are
thu
expo
to
a
flux
of
electron
similar
to
the
continu
bombard
by

of
radiat
meanwhil
there
are
other

discus

note
that
in
larson
theori
uncharg

are
also
massless
and
are
basic

there

accord
to

theori
i
might
have

larson
is

that

le

fli
around

if
thi
is
true
then
the

might
be
abl
to
interact
with
these

perhap
give
