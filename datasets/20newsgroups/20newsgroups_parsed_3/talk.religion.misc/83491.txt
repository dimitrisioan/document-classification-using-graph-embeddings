thi
bring
up
anoth
question
i
still
have
to
ponder
whi
is
there
so
much
antisemit
whi
do
peopl
hate
jew
i
dont
hate
jew
i
consid
them
to
be
like
anyon
els
sinner
we
all
are
i
dont
know
i
dont
care
about
ethnic
right
and
wrong
myself
but
it
evid
that
christian
consid
jew
no
longer
to
be
the
sole
select
group
of
god
peopl
while
jew
consid
thi
to
be
the
case
christian
antisemit
come
from
the
obviou
fact
that
the
jew
should
know
the
hebrew
scriptur
better
than
anyon
els
yet
they
did
not
convert
to
christian
en
mass
thu
reject
christian
love
no
wonder
thi
caus
antisemit
one
might
even
wonder
that
if
christian
didnt
do
thi
separ
would
antisemit
have
even
start
i
dont
see
whi
not
where
are
the
rest
of
the
tribal
peopl
what
happen
to
the
tribe
of
the
america
cultur
is
seen
a
differ
and
undesir
in
the
west
particular
in
the
u
with
it
fail
melt
pot
concept
most
tribe
have
been
hunt
to
extinct
the
hebrew
tribe
is
one
of
the
few
surviv
from
the
neolith
of
cours
it
becom
difficult
at
time
to
separ
christian
from
the
western
experi
so
perhap
you
are
right
perhap
it
would
have
been
a
better
world
if
the
cultur
experi
in
christian
never
happen
