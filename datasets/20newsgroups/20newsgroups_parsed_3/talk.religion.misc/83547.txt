i
had
seen
much
the
same
in
other
typicalchristian
antigay

literatur
gay
peopl
are
and
will
con
tinu
to
be
persecut
a
long
a
such
propaganda
petpetu
you
may
be
unawar
of
all
the
statistica
find
concern
africanamerican
that
have
been
publish
and
use
by
variou
group
to
reenforc
their
own
bia
against
africanamerican
we
usual
think
of
the
kkk
in
these
instanc
but
there
are
mani
other
group
of
cours
the
vast
major
of
the
public
scoff
at
such
find
and
document
today
but
that
wa
not
alway
the
case
fortun
africanamerican
had
white
who
support
their
caus
and
public
sentiment
wa
eventu
if
not
entir
turn
around
there
wa
even
a
civil
war
and
antinegro
sentiment
increas
in
fact
until
law
were
put
in
place
to
protect
the
inalien
right
of
black
it
wa
pretti
much
legal
to
discrimin
against
them
i
know
mani
gay
and
i
will
not
turn
my
back
on
them
or
their
right
to
be
free
form
discrimin
you
may
think
that
i
have
been
deceiv
or
someth
that
is
your
perog
my
church
christian
church
discipl
of
christ
openli
affirm
the
right
of
oppress
peopl
of
all
segment
of
societi
includ
gay
we
believ
the
gospel
messag
of
preach
to
all
creation
and
make
discipl
we
believ
in
the
lord
great
command
to
love
and
we
beleiv
in
stand
up
for
the
oppress
even
if
it
is
not
popular
to
do
so
i
realli
like
my
church
for
last
reason
the
most
i
can
find
a
church
almost
anywher
in
the
valley
that
stand
for
the
gospel
and
belief
in
the
command
of
love
though
im
hardpress
to
find
mani
who
actual
sho
love
but
not
mani
are
will
to
champion
the
oppress
especi
within
their
own
commun
i
may
have
lost
face
with
the
greater
christian
commun
for
the
unpopular
of
my
belief
but
so
did
the
abolitionist
against
the
oppress
of
africanamerican
mani
were
even
kill
and
treat
a
runaway
slave
for
be
niggerlov
and
such
i
guess
ive
decid
the
challeng
is
worth
it
in
my
talk
with
gay
men
and
woman
i
have
heard
tragic
stori
after
tragic
stori
center
around
fail
marriag
wife
and
husband
who
are
straight
who
have
been
hurt
in
the
process
etc
funni
thing
is
i
dont
know
of
one
case
where
the
parent
exwiv
or
even
child
have
continu
to
reject
their
gay
famili
member
son
daughter
exhusband
father
etc
after
they
began
to
take
part
in
some
form
of
support
group
like
pflag
im
apal
by
the
legisl
which
pass
in
colorado
and
am
equal
out
rage
that
such
slimey
peopl
a
loui
sheldon
from
the
tradit
valu
coalit
have
been
activ
work
in
the
christian
underground
to
garner
support
within
sever
i
believ
state
thi
come
novemb
for
more
oppress
legis
against
gay
perhap
you
dont
get
it
and
mayb
you
never
will
mani
didnt
get
it
in
the
middl
age
and
the
proclaim
god
will
be
done
a
they
massacr
thousand
in
witch
hunt
and
inquisit
the
messag
that
come
through
loud
and
clear
by
propon
against
gay
right
and
against
gay
in
gener
is
that
there
is
a
strong
dislik
even
hatr
for
gay
whether
you
want
to
call
it
such
or
not
it
doesnt
chang
the
result
the
major
flaw
in
all
thi
postur
is
that
in
the
end
the
final
effect
of
post
like
that
of
your
and
mr
hudson
is
that
you
have
a
condit
love
for
gay
condit
chang
and
well
love
you
thi
is
sure
strang
come
from
a
group
who
claim
that
god
ha
an
uncondit
love
one
that
call
peopl
just
a
they
are
sure
there
are
thing
that
will
natur
chang
and
habit
like
alcohol
wife
beat
etc
that
need
to
be
chang
through
some
sort
of
therapi
but
then
there
are
thing
like
lefthanded
etc
that
no
amount
of
beat
it
out
of
peopl
is
go
to
result
in
anyth
more
than
an
outward
conforminti
to
other
peopl
expect
in
the
process
thi
coerc
conform
caus
mani
peopl
a
great
deal
of
harm
especi
when
it
is
caus
by
peopl
who
have
noth
more
to
gain
from
it
that
to
becom
even
more
puf
up
about
their
own
sens
of
pseuperspiritu
thi
is
sad
but
i
thoroughli
believ
that
one
day
it
will
chang
it
may
be
unpopular
to
cri
for
justic
and
equal
when
the
basi
ha
to
do
with
someth
veri
person
like
sexual
a
taboo
subject
even
today
but
i
firmli
believ
in
the
right
of
individu
to
be
free
from
impos
regul
on
thier
bedroom
it
funni
that
most
straight
peopl
have
success
remov
restrict
and
oppress
legisl
against
invas
legisl
but
we
like
to
maintain
thi
littl
chestnut
of
repressiona
though
it
help
u
maintain
a
sens
of
superior
over
at
least
one
segment
of
societi
gay
peopl
are
not
crimin
anoth
interest
thing
happen
recent
a
veri
promin
charismat
church
in
the
silicon
valley
here
had
two
of
it
pastor
arrest
for
self
admit
charg
of
pederasti
men
have
sex
with
boy
thi
had
appar
been
go
on
for
some
time
a
coupl
year
but
sinc
the
charg
were
voluntari
and
the
church
work
close
with
the
polic
so
i
imagin
that
wa
how
they
manag
to
downplay
it
in
the
medium
how
could
such
a
thing
happen
when
the
church
itself
ha
an
exgay
ministri
one
of
my
friend
recent
told
me
he
wa
approach
by
someon
who
is
go
through
the
reparit
therapi
there
and
he
wa
thoroughli
convinc
that
the
request
for
dinner
wa
not
an
invit
to
attend
the
ministri
these
are
difficult
time
we
live
in
but
provid
hostil
environ
and
creat
and
perpetu
an
atmospher
that
breed
hate
and
violenc
is
not
the
call
of
the
christian
commun
the
result
of
the
pass
amend
in
colorado
ha
creat
an
organ
who
poster
are
appear
all
over
colorado
call
straight
i
forget
the
whole
definit
off
hand
but
the
last
part
wa
against
immor
gross
homosexu
trash
and
their
motto
is
work
for
a
fagfre
america
with
an
implicit
advoc
for
violenc
thi
is
sick
and
it
seem
to
be
what
you
and
mr
hudson
and
other
are
embrac
we
christian
have
a
loooooooooong
tradit
of
coersion
and
oppress
toward
those
we
feel
dont
measur
up
and
constant
berat
from
organ
like
the
christian
research
institut
while
they
do
have
a
good
purpos
also
their
major
work
seem
to
be
find
new
and
better
way
of
exclud
peopl
the
gospel
i
believ
is
not
so
neg
rather
it
seek
way
to
includ
peopl
i
have
sever
of
dr
martin
book
and
find
them
quit
help
especi
concern
cult
but
it
seem
that
cri
ha
becom
a
cult
unto
itself
whi
dont
we
just
stick
to
the
posit
and
find
way
to
bring
peopl
to
jesu
istead
of
take
bullwhip
and
drive
them
away
