josephu
the
jewish
historian
who
also
wrote
of
jesu
in
addit
the
four
gospel
account
are
veri
much
in
harmoni
bill
i
have
taken
the
time
to
explain
that
biblic
scholar
consid
the
josephu
refer
to
be
an
earli
christian
insert
by
biblic
scholar
i
mean
an
expert
who
in
the
cours
of
hi
or
her
research
is
will
to
let
the
chip
fall
where
they
may
thi
exclud
literalist
who
may
otherwis
be
defin
a
biblic
apologist
they
find
what
they
want
to
find
they
are
not
trustworthi
by
scholarli
standard
and
other
whi
an
insert
read
it
i
have
a
number
of
time
the
passag
is
glaringli
out
of
context
and
josephu
a
superb
writer
had
no
such
problem
elsewher
in
hi
work
the
passag
ha
noth
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
in
which
it
lie
it
suddenli
appear
and
then
just
a
quickli
disappear
i
think
thi
is
a
weak
argument
the
fact
is
there
are
two
refer
to
jesu
in
antiqu
of
the
jew
one
of
which
ha
unquestion
at
least
been
alter
by
christian
origen
wrote
in
the
third
centuri
that
josephu
did
not
recogn
jesu
a
the
messiah
while
the
long
passag
say
the
opposit
there
is
an
arab
manuscript
of
antiqu
of
the
jew
which
contain
a
version
of
the
passag
which
is
much
le
gungho
for
jesu
and
may
be
authent
there
is
no
question
that
origen
in
the
third
centuri
saw
a
refer
to
jesu
in
josephu
there
are
no
manuscript
of
antiqu
which
lack
the
refer
it
is
possibl
that
it
wa
fabric
out
of
whole
cloth
and
insert
but
i
dont
think
it
veri
likelynor
do
i
think
there
is
a
consensu
in
the
scholarli
commun
that
thi
is
the
case
i
know
ga
well
take
thi
posit
but
that
becaus
he
take
the
veri
small
minor
view
that
jesu
never
exist
and
he
is
a
professor
of
german
not
of
biblic
histori
or
new
testament
or
anyth
directli
