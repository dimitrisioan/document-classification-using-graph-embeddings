unless
you
didnt
realiz
it
you
are
just
now
involv
in
a
debat
where
we
have
variou
opinion
and
each
entiti
ha
it
own
frame
where
the
opinion
is
express
i
think
i
dont
need
to
state
the
dread
rword
so
it
sometim
correct
to
say
that
moral
is
object
or
what
if
you
were
abl
to
prove
that
moral
is
object
then
it
would
be
correct
to
do
so
the
problem
is
by
the
veri
mean
of
the
word
in
question
to
do
so
is
oxymoron
of
cours
you
could
redefin
the
word
but
that
would
still
not
lend
support
to
the
underli
concept
after
all
i
could
hardli
be
wrong
without
drag
in
the
oword
thi
doe
not
par
how
could
you
hardli
be
wrong
without
drag
in
the
oword
for
your
part
when
you
say
that
relativ
is
true
that
just
your
opinion
whi
do
folk
get
so
heat
then
if
a
belief
in
relativ
is
mere
a
matter
of
tast
to
be
fair
you
have
been
veri
calm
i
get
the
impress
that
becaus
you
dont
care
about
notion
of
object
in
ani
flavour
right
i
have
no
problem
with
object
at
all
it
is
my
object
that
ha
led
me
to
conclud
that
moral
is
