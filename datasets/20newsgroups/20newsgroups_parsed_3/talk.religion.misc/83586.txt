brian
k
guess
what
you
miss
the
point
on
a
scale
from
cold
to
hot
you
are
at
degre
kelvin
i
know
about
sanctif
ive
been
taught
all
about
it
in
sunday
school
catech
class
and
theolog
class
but
even
after
all
that
i
still
cant
accept
it
mayb
im
still
not
understand
it
or
mayb
im
just
understand
it
all
too
well
then
a
you
understand
it
what
is
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
know
that
the
punish
of
an
innoc
man
is
wrong
ye
i
agre
with
that
but
what
doe
that
have
to
do
with
jesu
punish
you
say
jesu
did
not
regard
hi
death
a
punish
ive
tri
repeatedli
over
the
cours
of
sever
year
to
accept
it
but
i
just
cant
good
i
wouldnt
eithernot
the
way
you
understand
it
if
you
can
explain
to
me
whi
the
death
of
jesu
wa
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
veri
glad
to
hear
it
and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warn
howev
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
argument
befor
and
they
just
dont
convinc
me
ask
jesu
himself
he
himself
said
whi
in
john
it
isnt
a
mysteri
to
anyon
and
there
certainli
is
no
need
for
a
persuas
argument
read
jesu
own
repli
to
your
question
jesu
give
more
reason
in
john
but
one
obviou
reason
whi
jesu
die
and
a
with
everyth
els
it
ha
noth
do
with
hi
punish
wa
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubt
and
believ
john
the
fact
that
jesu
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obviou
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
thi
obviou
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vaniti
whi
did
jesu
suffer
in
hi
death
again
ask
jesu
jesu
say
whi
in
john
that
no
mysteri
either
the
world
hate
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclam
of
how
far
we
human
botch
thing
up
and
thu
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
and
whi
cant
you
brian
k
accept
thi
how
can
you
the
world
can
not
accept
him
becaus
it
neither
see
him
nor
know
him
john
the
animos
and
the
lack
of
knowledg
that
come
out
in
your
twist
of
robert
daili
vers
is
veri
convinc
testimoni
of
the
truth
of
john
and
i
pray
and
hope
that
i
do
blurt
out
such
animos
and
lack
of
knowledg
i
am
not
perfect
either
but
regardless
of
that
i
thank
god
that
jesu
reveal
himself
to
me
without
whom
id
also
be
bumbl
about
blindli
though
arrogantli
slander
the
veri
person
who
creat
me
and
who
love
me
