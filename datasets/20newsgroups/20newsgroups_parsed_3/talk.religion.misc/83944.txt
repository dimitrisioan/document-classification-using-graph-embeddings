respond
hmm
it
seem
that
thi
is
the
core
of
christian
then
you
have
to
feel
guilti
i
think
i
see
where
you
are
come
from
kent
jesu
doesnt
view
guilt
like
our
modern
venacular
color
it
feel
have
noth
to
do
with
guilt
feel
aris
from
the
state
of
be
guilti
feel
and
guilt
are
mutal
exclus
feel
are
a
reaction
from
guilt
jesu
is
talk
about
the
guilt
state
not
the
reaction
let
me
give
you
an
exampl
have
you
ever
made
a
mistak
have
you
ever
lie
to
someon
even
a
littl
white
lie
have
you
ever
claim
to
know
someth
that
you
realli
didnt
know
have
you
ever
hate
someon
have
you
ever
been
selfish
are
you
guilti
of
ani
one
of
these
the
answer
is
of
cours
ye
you
are
guilti
period
that
is
it
what
jesu
is
get
at
no
big
surpris
feel
do
not
even
enter
the
pictur
consid
jesu
use
of
the
word
guilt
a
how
a
court
us
it
jesu
is
concern
that
everyon
should
admit
that
they
are
guilti
of
be
imperfect
the
bibl
call
it
the
state
that
we
are
all
sinner
we
all
do
bad
thing
even
the
most
insignfic
thing
that
we
do
wrong
is
proof
of
our
guilt
that
we
are
all
sinner
it
is
it
in
our
natur
to
do
bad
thing
we
are
sinner
therefor
we
do
bad
thing
be
a
sinner
is
fact
it
is
not
a
pleasant
fact
but
it
is
just
a
fact
we
are
not
perfect
call
u
sinner
should
have
no
more
emot
charg
to
you

singl
person
that
will
save

sheep
mani
peopl
in

prophesi
in
your
name
and
do
miracl
and
do
good
thing
in

name
and
what
did
jesu
say

me
for
i
never
knew

that
is
the
cornerston
of
christian
kent
jesu
must
know
you
a
hi
friend

your
relationship
to
jesu

he
is
your
friend
and

be
count
among
those
who
will
share

brian
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
i
dont
feel
guilti
at
all
i
do
mistak
and
i
regret
them
howev
ive
never
had
thi
huge
guilt
feel
hang
over
my
shoulder
good
it
show
that
you
have
a
strong
selfimagethat
you
love
yourself
that
is
the
second
greatest
command
jesu
taught
if
onli
more
peopl
could
do
a
you
do
a
i
said
befor
in
the
common
english
venacular
feel
guilti
ha
a
differ
mean
than
the
state
of
guilt
thi
all
is
a
veri
clear
indic
that
you
need
a
certain
person
type
in
order
to
believ
and
adjust
to
certain
religi
doctrin
and
if
your
person
type
is
opposit
then
you
are
not
that
easili
attach
to
a
certain
world
view
system
i
believ
what
we
all
need
in
our
person
is
a
lot
le
ego
a
lot
le
selfcentered
and
a
lot
more
uncondit
love
there
are
human
that
subscrib
to
the
same
notion
the
nice
thing
is
that
when
you
final
shake
off
thi
huge
burden
the
shoulder
feel
far
more
relax
ye
you
have
state
what
jesu
said
rememb
come
to
me
take
my
yoke
upon
your
shoulder
for
my
burden
is
light
a
yoke
is
use
to
direct
ox
to
do
work
onc
you
have
a
relationship
with
jesu
you
and
him
share
the
yoke
and
the
burden
of
life
have
god
at
your
side
is
of
great
advantag
