adventur
toni
alicia
write
let
start
with
the
name
rosicrucian
i
took
me
a
long
time
to
come
to
the
conclus
that
there
is
a
differ
between
a
member
of
a
rosicrucian
bodi
and
be
a
rosicrucian
so
when
you
say
that
you
met
some
rosicrucian
you
mean
member
of
a
group
that
call
themselv
rosicrucian
at
least
that
is
what
your
observ
suggest
respons
thi
make
much
sens
to
me
thi
is
also
true
of
most
religion
there
is
a
differ
between
be
a
member
of
a
group
of
peopl
who
call
themselv
hindu
or
christian
or
pagan
and
actual
be
ani
of
these
the
social
group
tend
to
make
veri
import
requir
about
not
belong
to
other
religion
i
find
that
the
ideal
describ
by
the
holi
text
of
most
religion
can
be
interpret
in
veri
similar
way
so
that
one
could
presum
that
mystic
is
the
core
of
everi
religion
and
huxley
perenni
philosophi
is
the
great
secret
core
of
all
mystic
trad
toni
id
prefer
if
you
would
have
state
up
front
that
it
wa
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
onli
becaus
they
may
be
confus
by
some
reader
of
thi
newsgroup
with
the
rosicrucian
order
amorc
base
the
usa
jurisdict

youll
have
to
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
that
lectureclasswhatev
had
been
present
by
amorc
it
is
unlik
that
you
would
have
had
the
same
impress
ie
youd
probabl
have
had
a
posit
impress
more
like
than
a
neg
one

respons
thi
may
be
slightli
off
ive
met
some
of
these
rosicrucian
and
have
a
coupl
friend
in
amorc
the
stori
ive
heard
and
the
slight
contact
ive
had
with
them
doe
not
give
me
the
hope
that
id
be
receiv
with
ani
kind
of
warm
welcom

still
like
to
think
that
most
peopl
who
are
involv
with
stratifi
relationship
monogami
religion
etc
are
in
deep
pain
and
hope
to
heal
it
within

a
cast

it
is
curiou
to

like
to
know
at
least
the
address
of
the
other
order
which
call
themselv
rosicrucian
