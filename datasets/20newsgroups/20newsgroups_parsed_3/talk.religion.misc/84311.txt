write
btw
the
parallel
univers
approach
impli
an
element
of
mind
in
the
veri
physic
realiti
of
the
univers
thi
sound
interest
but
what
exactli
do
you
mean
well
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
read
the
book
parallel
univers
by
dr
fred
wolf
in
essenc
dr
wolf
say
that
one
interpret
of
the
subatom
particlewav
dualiti
is
that
what
we
perceiv
a
a
wave
is
actual
an
infin
number
of
parallel
univers
overlaid
and
in
each
of
these
univers
there
is
a
particl
in
a
differ
locat
when
we
do
someth
to
make
a
particl
appear
we
are
actual
caus
all
the
parallel
univers
to
collaps
into
one
appar
thi
is
one
line
of
thought
on
the
natur
of
qm
that
is
go
through
some
of
the
scientif
commun
dr
wolf
and
mani
other
claim
that
somehow
the
collaps
is
caus
by
the
mental
effort
of
observ
the
particl
thi
impli
that
mind
is
more
than
mere
a
biolog
phenomenon
he
then
extrapol
that
if
mind
is
an
integr
part
of
the
univers
then
perhap
conscious
is
the
element
that
give
order
and
form
to
the
univers
itthemself
it
all
get
rather
interest
but
what
i
find
facin
is
that
thi
would
explain
the
phenomenon
of
magick
a
practic
in
my
religion
dr
wolf
specul
that
the
order
function
of
mind
could
be
caus
by
the
select
of
a
futur
from
an
infinit
number
of
possibl
futur
he
say
that
thi
might
be
done
by
some
sort
of
commun
between
one
current
and
possibl
futur
self
i
have
long
specul
that
if
magick
is
not
mere
a
form
of
self
delus
then
perhap
it
could
be
caus
by
some
sort
of
a
select
of
one
of
mani
possibl
futur
i
realiz
that
thi
get
pretti
bizarr
but
it
never
hurt
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
at
least
file
it
all
away
a
anoth
possibil
explain
of
the
world
in
which
we
find
ourselv
after
all
the
more
we
learn
about
the
univers
in
which
we
live
the
more
we
learn
that
it
is
truli
a
veri
strang
place
