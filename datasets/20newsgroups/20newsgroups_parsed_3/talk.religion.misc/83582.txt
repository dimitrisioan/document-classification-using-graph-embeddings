thi
about
these
other
promis
of

that
we
keep
get
subject

could
you
plea

the
onli
way
to
critic

to
some
other
trm
articl
call
it
a
that
took
a
quot
out

but
the
lack
of
evid
for
x
doe
not
constitut
evid
for
the
lack
of
x
a
common
creationist
error
so
the
fact
that
stephen
did
not
repli
to
a

not
justifi
the
conclus
that
stephen
condon
take
quot
out

if
you

i
admit
that
my
assumpt

have
been
a
bit
hasti
if

just
say
yup
have
