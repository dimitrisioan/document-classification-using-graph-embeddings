re
a
messag
for
you
mr
presid
how
do
you
know
what
happen
in
articl
timothi
j
brent
write
give
me
a
break
what
fireman
should
have
to
deal
with
a
blaze
like
that
and
get
shot
at
at
the
same
time
nearli
all
of
them
wit
la
fireman
are
among
our
real
hero
most
of
the
time
i
wonder
when
they
were
actual
aask
to
come
or
if
they
found
out
about
the
fire
over
the
tv
shot
at
by
whom
prove
it
these
peopl
were
break
the
law
i
agre
these
werent
the
best
tactic
when
law
replac
justic
the
system
is
die
or
dead
note
that
we
had
a
small
revolut
year
ago
on
thi
point
they
probabl
should
have
back
off
pull
the
perimet
way
back
and
let
them
sit
there
with
no
medium
attent
until
they
decid
to
come
out
the
onli
other
altern
i
see
would
have
been
to
send
in
a
coupl
of
special
forc
guy
to
captur
or
assassin
koresh
but
rememb
these
fruit
or
perhap
just
wait
or
maybeeven
send
in
a
few
agent
who
are
christian
to
sit
down
and
pray
outsid
the
line
tri
affin
rather
than
subvers
loop
were
put
their
life
on
the
line
voluntarili
whi
should
chuckl
so
would
you
if
someon
point
a
gun
at
you
at
that
point
you
can
die
or
live
and
if
live
mean
stayng
in
a
build
to
keep

more
danger
than

would
risk
my
