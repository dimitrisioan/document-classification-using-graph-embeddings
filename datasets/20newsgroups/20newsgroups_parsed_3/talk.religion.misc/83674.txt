can
you
pleas
point
to
someth
anyth
that

be
explain
without
accept
a
a
fact
the
exist
of
a
god
in
precis
the
way
your
holi
book
describ
can
you
pleas
convinc
me
that
your
religion
is
more
than
a
veri
cleverlyconstruct
fabl
and
that
it
doe
inde
have
some
bear
on
my
own
person
daytoday
life
would
you
consid
the
word
of
an
eyewit
peter
to
testifi
to
the
event
surround
jesu
life
no
there
are
two
problem
here
peter
die
two
millenia
ago
the
origin
letter
he
wrote
have
long
sinc
decay
into
dust
if
he
were
aliv
today
and
i
could
question
him
then
thi
might
lend
credibl
to
your
claim
but
probabl
not
much
becaus
after
all
ive
heard
peopl
claim
with
all
sincer
that
theyv
spoken
with
elvi
recent
but
after
hi
death
peter
write
were
transcrib
by
monk
for
centuri
and
i
find
it
hard
to
believ
that
one
of
them
somewher
didnt
decid
to
chang
the
word
of
someth
to
make
it
in
hi
opinion
a
littl
easier
to
understand
even
if
peter
did
wit
the
miracl
of
jesu
two
millenia
ago
that
doesnt
mean
that
your
deiti
is
what
the
bibl
say
it
is
god
might
just
be
satan
tri
to
convinc
everyon
that
he
a
nice
guy
or
even
that
your
deiti
is
still
aliv
and
activ
in
the
world
today
nice
tri
but
it
just
isnt
enough
to
convinc
me
especi
sinc
your
wild
claim
about
your
deiti
seem
to
fli
in
the
face
of
the
way
ive
observ
the
world
to
work
pleas
find
someth
