mr

the
follow
a
part
of
a
book
review
section
in
thi
peopl
magazin
spring
edit
i
conclud
with
a
littl
sermon
becaus
i
believ
we
will
not
be
a
mormon
or
humanfamili
until
we
can
get
over
label
and
reject
each
other
with
term
like
feminist
or
patriarch
liber
or
conserv
christian
or
nonchristian
hal
when
we
are
tempt
to
draw
a
circl
around
a
set
of
belief
and
tradit
and
style
and
call
it
american
then
exclud
those
who
dont
fit
it
may
be
well
to
consid
that
perhap
the
most
central
defin
characterist
of
a
good
american
might
be
one
who
doesnt
draw
exclus
circl
that
the
surest
way
of
exclud
ourselv
from
the
central
american
ideal
is
by
exclud
other
and
when
we
are
tempt
to
draw
a
circl
around
mormon
or
christian
to
decid
who
is
orthodox
and
who
isnt
by
how
much
they
agre
with
u
it
might
be
well
to
consid
that
the
central
pillar
of
christ
orthodoxi
is
our
abil
to
love
uncondit
those
who
are
differ
and
includ
them
in
our
famili
i
recent
spent
some
time
in
a
christian
bookstor
in
california
the
servic
wa
excel
the
clerk
and
custom
all
smile
neat
and
wellscrub
and
there
were
the
expect
wholesom
offer
of
scriptur
commentari
sentiment
fiction
and
collect
of
evangelist
sermon
but
i
wa
dismay
to
find
how
much
shelf
space
wa
given
to
attack
other
often
viciouslywheth
the
polit
left
our
modern
american
cultur
or
other
religion
a
whole
section
wa
devot
to
cult
and
the
occult
and
a
you
might
expect
mormon
wa
right
there
under
the
same
rubric
and
indict
often
by
the
same
author
a
satan
and
i
found
i
could
either
rent
or
buy
in
english
or
spanish
copi
of
the
god
maker
that
absurdli
inaccur
even
libel
but
veri
popular
and
danger
antimormon
film
that
us
exaclti
the
same
techniqu
and
even
accus
of
the
nazi
film
that
scapego
jew
in
the
s
it
seem
to
me
one
major
indic
that
a
person
is
a
genuin
convert
to
christ
and
hi
redempt
love
is
hi
lack
of
paranoia
and
anxieti
perfect

casteth
out
fear
i
john
i
have
alway
been
pleas
that
the
ld
church
ha
not
engag
in
attack
on
other
faith
though
i
find
a
dishearten
increas
in
willing
of
individu
mormon
to
engag
in
the

kind
of
stereotyp

scapegoatingand
even

right

ha
launch
thi
year
against
the
polit
left
and
american

it
is
a
fear
ironi
that
in
so
do
mormon
take
common
caus
with
