they
find
what
they
want
to
find
they
are
not
trustworthi
by
scholarli
standard
and
other
ive
seen
thi
claim
about
the
josephu
insert
fli
around
the
net
too
often
to
continu
to
ignor
it
perhap
it
true
wa
there
onli
one
josephu
manuscipt
if
there
were
say
copi
the
forger
would
have
to
put
hi
insert
into
all
of

by
the

token
sinc
josephu
wa
a

whi
are
biblic

jack
i
becam
awar
of
the

year
ago
so
i
decid
to
check
it
out
on
my
own

mine
scholar
sometim
do
not
even
mention
the
two
josephu
entri
anoth
subtleti
reflect
consensu
so
far
a
i
can
deduc
today
consensu
is
built
on
at
least
three
thing
the
long
passag
is
way
out
of
context
origen
did
not
know
about
the
long
passag
and
the
short
and
long
passag
are
contradictori
i
dont
know
the
refer
wherein
the
argument
which
led
to
consensu
are
orgin
develop
doe
anyon

them
includ
theologian
and
historian
the
former
like
the
latter
incorpor

so
the

is

such
a
