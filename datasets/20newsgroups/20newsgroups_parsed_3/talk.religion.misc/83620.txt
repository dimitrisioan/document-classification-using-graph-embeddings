write
good
question
my
point
wa
that
a
world
with
truth
is
better
than
a
world
with
falsehood
a
world
in
which
it
were
possibl
to
say
ye
i
am
hold
a
jew
the
truth
and
you
me
the
jew
and
the
s
guy
all
sit
down
to
crack
open
a
bottl
of
whiskey
is
better
than
the
grim
altern
you
present
obvious
thi
is
not
possibl
and
the
best
altern
seem
to
be
to
lie
that
becaus
other
valu
are
involv
such
a
life
now
that
is
just
my
opinion
dont
confus
the
claim
object
moral
exist
with
the
claim
i
have
a
lock
on
moral
i
think
that
at
thi
point
it
would
actual
be
quit
easi
to
confus
object
moral
with
rel
moral
jon
actual
jon
that
is
quit
true
christian
peopl
have
caus
object
moral
to
look
veri
rel
after
all
that
wa
the
point
of
the
origin
question
in
thi
thread
ie
can
we
toss
out
christian
becaus
it
is
so
obvious
inconsist
with
it
own
principl
if
you
will
bear
with
me
i
will
attempt
to
explain
thi
appar
inconsist
from
at
least
one
christian
viewpoint
if
god
exist
and
is
the
creator
of
mankind
a
the
bibl
claim
then
he
ha
a
pretti
welldefin
concept
of
what
make
peopl
tick
physic
emot
etc
god
ha
an
object
moral
for
u
that
is
to
say
he
ha
no
troubl
understand
what
is
good
for
or
detriment
to
the
creatur
he
creat
galatian
for
we
mankind
are
hi
workmanship
creat
in
christ
jesu
for
good
work
a
moral
which
god
prepar
beforehand
a
welldefin
design
that
we
might
walk
in
them
howev
contrari
to
what
mani
peopl
assum
includ
the
pharase
of
the
bibl
god
moral
can
not
be
complet
codifi
in
a
list
of
rule
and
regul
to
some
extent
everi
activ
of
a
person
life
creat
a
new
situat
to
which
moral
must
be
appli
there
never
could
be
enough
volum
to
codifi
god
object
moral
for
u
throughout
histori
mankind
ha
tri
to
reduc
moral
to
a
list
of
rule
object
if
you
plea
in
the
old
testament
we
have
both
principl
and
specif
rule
by
the
time
of
jesu
most
of
the
principl
were
obscur
by
the
emphasi
men
had
place
on
the
rule
volum
of
addit
rule
had
been
made
to
tri
to
codifi
the
applic
of
the
principl
we
mankind
werent
comfort
with
the
subject
of
principl
for
refer
see
matthew
where
jesu
explain
the
differ
between
the
law
and
the
principl
of
the
law
for
exampl
in
vers
you
have
heard
that
the
ancient
were
told
you
shall
not
commit
murderand
whoever
commit
murder
shall
be
liabl
to
the
court
but
i
say
to
you
that
everyon
who
is
angri
with
hi
brother
shall
be
liabl
to
the
court
the
object
moral
of
god
get
blur
by
our
inept
interpret
of
it
we
christian
have
made
our
biggest
error
when
we
have
allow
ani
one
person
or
group
of
peopl
decid
exactli
what
god
intend
for
u
if
we
christian
would
stay
commit
to
seek
god
will
instead
of
tri
to
prove
we
alreadi
had
it
all
figur
out
we
might
do
a
better
job
of
allow
other
to
find
god
object
moral
for
themselv
if
jesu
is
who
he
said
he
wasi
and
that
the
fundament
question
then
he
is
object
moral
