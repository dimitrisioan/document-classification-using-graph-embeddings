religion
and
marriag
i
wasnt
sure
if
thi
wa
the
right
newsgroup
to
post
thi
to
but
i
guess
the
misc
is
there
for
a
reason
here
go
i
am
get
marri
in
june
to
a
devout
wisconsin
synod
lutheran
i
would
classifi
myself
a
a
strong
agnosticweak
athiest
thi
ha
been
a
a
subject
of
mani
discuss
between
u
and
is
realli
our
onli
real
obstacl
we
dont
have
ani
real
difficulti
with
the
religi
differ
yet
but
i
expect
they
will
pop
up
when
we
have
child
i
have
agre
to
rais
the
child
nomin
lutheran
that
is
lutheran
tradit
but
tri
to
keep
an
open
mind
i
am
not
sure
if
thi
is
even
possibl
though
i
feel
that
that
the
worst
qualiti
of
be
devoutli
relig
is
the
lack
of
an
open
mind
anyway
i
guess
ill
get
on
with
my
question

so
far
of

it
a
lot
and
