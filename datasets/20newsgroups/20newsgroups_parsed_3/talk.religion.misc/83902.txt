re
christian
metaeth
in
articl
michael
siemon
write
well
the
whole
point
of
make
these
the
base
command
is
that
they
arent
reduc
to
rule
a
set
of
rule
is
a
moral
code
or
a
law
code
or
an
algorithm
for
act
such
thing
can
be
veri
help
to
individu
or
societi
but
not
if
they
are
use
instead
of
a
person
involv
in
and
respons
for
one
action
the
two
command
are
rule
they
are
mere
rule
that
are
so
vagu
that
they
are
practic
devoid
of
mean
michael
siemon
acknowledg
thi
everi
time
he
write
that
the
resolut
of
an
argument
over
them
turn
on
secular
and
cultur
assumpt
that
are
independ
of
these
rule
the
great
command
is
more
than
anyth
el
a
call
to
act
a
if
you
were
god
and
accept
ultim
respons
in
your
everi
action
the
command
to
love
your
neighbor
a
yourself
can
be
view
in
part
a
remind
man
that
he
is
not
god
and
can
not
act
a
if
he
ha
ultim
respons
inde
mani
tradit
present
an
interpret
where
believ
are
suppos
to
interpret
love
one
neighbor
a
follow
variou
other
rule
and
reli
on
their
god
to
make
thing
come
out
right
precis
becaus
it
would
be
wrong
for
man
to
assum
such
ultim
respons
onc
again
we
are
confront
with
good
sound
goo
that
mean
whatev
the
reader
want
it
to
mean
conserv
may
twist
thi
act
a
if
you
were
god
to
mean
lay
down
rule
for
other
peopl
and
be
a
nasti
to
them
a
possibl
if
they
dont
keep
your
rule
they
are
so
insist
and
obviou
about
thi
that
they
have
convinc
a
lot
of
peopl
who
rightli
reject
the
whole
concept
that
such
idioci
is
how
god
act
and
who
is
to
say
that
thi
interpret
is
twist
there
are
mani
passag
in
the
bibl
that
in
their
most
straightforward
read
show
the
christian
god
behav
in
just
thi
way
michael
can
not
refer
to
base
claim
or
base
command
to
show
that
such
read
are
twist
becaus
thi
diverg
in
understand
occur
even
in
tri
to
interpret
the
base
claim
and
command
in
address
conserv
christian
michael
will
necessarili
draw
upon
secular
and
cultur
notion
that
these
conserv
christian
will
reject
but
whi
should
anyon
be
look
for
an
ethic
system
sinc
our
societi
is
eager
to
hand
u
one
or
more
no
matter
what
we
do
it
may
be
that
we
need
a
principl
for
the
critiqu
of
ethic
system
in
which
case
i
will
profer
the
agap
allel
onc
again
but
these
base
command
are
too
vagu
to
serv
a
a
principl
for
the
critiqu
of
ethic
system
the
mean
of
these
base
command
for
ani
believ
deriv
from
the
secular
and
cultur
notion
that
the
believ
bring
to
them
from
how
the
believ
mix
their
demand
with
straightforward
read
of
other
biblic
passag
from
a
particular
sectarian
tradit
or
from
some
combin
of
these
thing
these
command
lack
suffici
substanc
in
themself
to
serv
a
a
basi
for
critic
ethic
system
what
mean
they
have
come
from
the
ethic
system
the
believ
bring
to
these
command
and
differ
bodi
of
christian
have
from
the
begin
urg
differ
ethic
system
or
in
some
case
none
a
a
result
it
is
bizarr
to
identifi
ani
one
of
these
system
howev
popular
or
infam
with
christian
christian
doe
not
have
a
torah
it
doe
not
have
a
quran
specif
christian
scriptur
ha
veri
littl
if
anyth
in
the
way
of
command
so
littl
that
the
christian
who
desper
want
command
go
mine
for
them
with
almost
no
support
the
one
singl
thing
in
the
gospel
which
jesu
specif
give
a
a
command
to
u
is
love
one
anoth
jesu
explicitli
state
that
thi
summar
jewish
law
which
would
seem
to
bring
in
all
of
it
if
we
properli
understand
what
it
mean
to
love
god
and
love
our
neighbor
there
are
mani
parabl
and
teach
the
gospel
attribut
to
jesu
that
are
straightforwardli
read
a
ethic
command
the
paulin
epistl
are
similarli
full
if
it
is
not
clear
that
these
all
come
togeth
in
a
sensibl
understand
of
ethic
behavior
the
problem
is
not
a
lack
of
raw
materi
i
am
a
radic
christian
onli
in
that
i
take
the
gospel
serious
no
michael
the
conserv
christian
also
take
the
gospel
serious
what
differenti
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
whi
dont
i
and
the
myriad
of
other
christian
like
me
tell
you
someth
about
christian
in
a
sen
the
wide
varieti
of
interpret
doe
tell
u
someth
about
christian
it
tell
u
that
the
new
testament
author
left
a
suffici
vagu
hodgepodg
that
it
can
serv
a
the
sourc
text
for
mani
vastli
differ
belief
about
the
natur
of
the
christian
god
and
about
what
men
should
and
shouldnt
do
the
ironi
here
is
that
there
is
noth
in
christian
per
se
that
michael
can
use
to
support
the
caus
of
lesbian
and
gay
everi
christian
principl
he
turn
to
thi
caus
is
effect
onli
through
the
extrachristian
principl
through
which
michael
interpret
hi
religion
and
the
homophob
appli
the
same
christian
principl
with
equal
justif
to
their
caus
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principl
that
make
michael
christian
benefici
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
a
benefici
perhap
moreso
without
be
filter
by
christian
interpret
michael
paint
a
pictur
of
standard
american
atheism
a
the
reject
of
the
evil
in
mani
conserv
christian
interpret
of
the
bibl
but
i
think
it
is
even
more
damag
to
christian
to
note
that
the
new
testament
present
such
a
vagu
hodgepodg
of
notion
about
the
natur
of
god
and
the
natur
of
the
good
except
of
cours
when
it
is
order
by
an
interpret
that
reli
on
extran
principl
here
i
think
we
should
appli
a
christian
parabl
where
a
cold
drink
can
have
it
valu
and
a
hot
drink
can
have
it
valu
but
the
lukewarm
we
should
spit
out
russel
