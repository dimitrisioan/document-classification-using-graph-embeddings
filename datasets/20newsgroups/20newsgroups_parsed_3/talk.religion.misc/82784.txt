re
question
for
those
with
popular
moral
hudson
and
from
a
materialist
point
of
view
it
could
be
said
that
the
nervou
system
is
just
matter
what
is
wrong
with
produc
chemic
reaction
in
matter
becaus
thi
matter
is
differ
it
is
aliv
and
selfawar
and
it

hudson
if
all
moral
were
rel
big
hairi
deal
a
i
said
you
appear
to
be
the
onli
person
say
that
all
moral
is
rel
most
peopl
i
know
do
hold
some
absolut
in
their
moral
system
i
person
believ
that
the
digniti
of
the
individu
and
the
right
of
free
will
are
absolut
i
recogn
that
there
are
some
moral
system
around
which
dont
accept
thi
i
reject
them
a
danger
and
antisoci
nazism
some
form
of
commun
fundamentalist
xtianityno
that
not
a
slam
but
for
the
most
part
almost
everi
moral
system
agre
on
these
two
point
me
and
the
sky
and
everyth
in
it
everyth
that
wa
creat
came
out
of
god
everyth
includ
thi
matter
is
part
of
god
therefor
is
it
wrong
to
put
part
of
god
in
a
test
tube
and
make
it
go
through
reaction
isnt
that
a
form
of
blasphemi
hudson
gener
christian
believ
in
a
creatorcr
distinct
other
religion
believ
in
one
big
whole
i
dont
accept
yor
premis
too
bad
i
know
im
right
so
i
get
to
enforc
my
view
upon
you
whether
you
like
my
premis
or
not
and
sinc
you
cant
prove
otherwis
there
isnt
even
an
intellectu
basi
for
your
resist
to
accept
my
viewpoint
hudson
how
long
will
it
be
befor
the
a
long
a
it
doesnt
hurt
someon
els
becom
more
and
more
rel
until
the
onli
rule
that
is
left
is
i
will
do
what
i
want
to
do
no
matter
who
it
hurt
there
a
big
jump
between
those
two
posit
and
you
know
it
veri
well
dont
play
stupid
i
realiz
that
your
tri
to
disput
what
you
call
popular
moral
by
use
what
you
think
is
logic
but
your
stretch
thi
a
bit
too
thin
hudson
i
dont
think
so
onc
moral
becom
rel
it
degener
i
am
say
that
reason
that
it
is
gener
evil
to
hurt
other
peopl
is
bad
though
i
dont
think
it
is
suffici
well
then
answer
me
thi
you
seem
to
be
oppos
to
moral
relativ
a
you
call
it
becaus
it
ha
the
capac
to
degener
obvious
then
you
would
advoc
a
nonrel
absolut
moral
system
whose
absolutist
moral
system
do
we
choos
how
do
we
come
to
thi
decis
what
about
peopl
who
disagre
with
the
chosen
moral
system
hudson
but
if
moral
is
consid
to
be
rel
and
thi
rule
isnt
base
on
anyth
but
is
just
an
arbitrari
rule
peopl
might
abandon
it
fine
i
can
agre
with
most
of
what
you
type
here
howev
just
becaus
moral
get
base
on
someth
nonrel
doe
not
mean
that
we
have
to
pick
your
xtianiti
a
it
base
we
can
start
a
moral
base
on
digniti
of
human
freedom
of
choic
toler
etc
and
never
ever
reli
on
xtianiti
for
anyth
just
becaus
someon
ha
a
consist
moral
system
base
on
true
principl
doe
not
mean
that
they
have
to
involv
xtianiti
in
it
xtianiti
certainli
doe
not
have
a
monopoli
on
principl
of
