i
would
like
to
add
my
support
for
a
misctaoism
discuss
group
i
applaud
the
enthusiam
shown
by
the
person
post
i
read
in
altmagick
but
i
differ
with
himher
in
believ
that
at
least
some
minim
paramet
should
be
agre
upon
thyagi
wrote
i
recommend
that
the
depth
of
gener
inde
of
ambigu
in
thi
newsgroup
misctaoism
be
maxim
call
the
tradit
old
or
new
is
rather
unnecessari
and
onli
lead
to
foolish
squabbl
there
is
no
doubt
that
natur
is
a
splendid
teacher
whether
she
appear
in
the
word
spoken
by
a
tree
or
by
a
stream
a
microb
or
a
star
let
u
not
limit
misctaoism
to
philosophi
but
if
we
dont
limit
it
to
someth
the
discuss
degener
into
a
big
amorph
glob
other
question
thyagi
propos
are
what
is
thi
actual
process
of
realiti
whi
is
taoism
base
upon
an
assumpt
whi
doe
thi
assumpt
concern
knowledg
and
what
can
be
known
what
is
the
valu
of
not
know
what
is
a
tao
what
doe
it
mean
to
be
taod
it
seem
to
me
that
these
question
more
properli
fall
into
the
categori
of
gener
metaphys
i
would
prefer
ani
misctaoism
to
deal
more
close
with
topic
and
work
more
close
associ
with
at
least
semiorthodox
taoism
with
establish
classic
work
definit
includ
and
work
like
mantak
chia
argu
about
i
think
neotaoism
should
be
exclud
or
get
it
own
group
what
i
mean
by
thi
is
humptydumpti
taoism
in
which
taoism
mean
whatev
a
poster
say
it
mean
thi
alttaoism
could
also
be
a
refug
for
debat
about
what
taoism
realli
mean
or
specul
on
sexual
alchemi
etc
eg
from
thyagi
again
taoism
doe
what
the
hell
it
want
i
tell
you
taoism
doesnt
exist
taoism
is
no
more
real
that
tao
decid
now
real
or
not
real
exist
or
notexist
when
shall
we
be
certain
kent
gloomili
predict
quot
from
thyagi
articl
howev
most
traffic
in
the
group
will
like
concern
the
philosoph
secular
taoism
aver
by
alan
watt
and
niel
bohr
and
yogic
taoism
a
it
pertain
to
medic
sexual
and
martial
techniqu
i
think
that
discuss
of
thi
natur
are
not
complet
out
of
place
what
happen
is
that
that
the
term
taoism
is
becom
complet
pollut
and
trivial
like
the
word
magic
alchemi
zen
etc
by
writer
appropri
the
word
to
mean
whatev
they
want
thi
is
seen
by
the
spate
of
new
age
book
entitl
the
tao
of
thi
that
and
everyth
els
with
respect
to
some
except
like
the
book
by
jou
tsunghwa
ani
other
commentsidea
i
look
forward
to
see
them
on
balanc
i
say
let
misctaoism
rip
and
let
the
chip
fall
where
they
may
if
it
just
get
fill
up
with
colleg
freshman
ask
about
the
tao
of
sex
then
it
will
have
been
a
failur
and
peopl
will
post
to
these
group
just
