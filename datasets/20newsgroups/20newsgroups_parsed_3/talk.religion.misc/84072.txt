etc
frank
decenso
i
need
to
priorit
thing
in
my
life
and
thi
board
is
not
all
that
import
to
me
of
cours
it
is
it
form
a
veri
big
part
of
your
selfrespect
you
come
onto
the
board
think
your
some
sort
of
apologeticist
for
your
faith
and
you
routin
get
roast
over
a
grill
for
stupid
theori
and
unfound
assumpt
frank
decenso
thi
board
will
have
to
wait
until
if
ever
i
can
organ
my
life
to
fit
it
in
i
tri
drop
out
but
sieferman
coerc
me
to
come
back

wont
thi
time
i
doubt
that
sieferman
ha
anyth
to
do
with
you
drop
out
it
probabl
closer
to
the
truth
to
say
that
you
dont
have
the
card
to
play
in
thi
game
becaus
you
insist
on
play
from
a
lose
hand
and
your
final
realiz
it
you
will
lurk
on
the
board
and
keep
quiet
for
a
while
look
for
an
area
where
you
are
certain
that
you
are
correct
and
then
well
see
you
pop
back
in
again
of
cours
you
then
will
say
that
you
have
mere
return
becaus
your
life
is
now
in
order
but
well
know
better
