mr
clinton
said
today
that
the
horribl
tragedi
of
the
waco
fiasco
should
remind
those
who
join
cult
of
the
danger
of
do
so
now
i
began
scratch
my
head
think
a
bad
sign
dont
the
mainstream
religion
in
thi
case
christianityor
the
th
day
adventist
in
particular
just
keep
these
guy
go
isnt
mr
clinton
condemn
hi
own
religion
after
all
isnt
it
a
cult
too
bad
thought
these
well
it
depend
on
whether
you
take
the
liter
dictionari
definit
of
cult
and
say
all
faith
are
cult
or
if
you
take
a
more
socialcontext
view
of
cult
which
allow
you
to
recogn
mainstream
religion
a
sociallyaccept
and
cult
a
group
that
involv
techniqu
of
brain
wash
and
all
the
other
characterist
that
defin
oppress
probli
not
the
best
word
cult
behaviour
my
understand
of
the
academ
use
of
the
word
cult
is
that
it
is
a
group
of
peopl
orient
around
a
singl
author
figur
it
need
not
be
religi
howev
i
have
