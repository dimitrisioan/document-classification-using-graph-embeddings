re
religion
and
marriag
paul
d
boxrud
write
i
wasnt
sure
if
thi
wa
the
right
newsgroup
to
post
thi
to
but
i
guess
the
misc
is
there
for
a
reason
here
go
i
am
get
marri
in
june
to
a
devout
wisconsin
synod
lutheran
i
would
classifi
myself
a
a
strong
agnosticweak
athiest
thi
ha
been
a
a
subject
of
mani
discuss
between
u
and
is
realli
our
onli
real
obstacl
we
dont
have
ani
real
difficulti
with
the
religi
differ
yet
but
i
expect
they
will
pop
up
when
we
have
child
i
have
agre
to
rais
the
child
nomin
lutheran
that
is
lutheran
tradit
but
tri
to
keep
an
open
mind
i
am
not
sure
if
thi
is
even
possibl
though
i
feel
that
that
the
worst
qualiti
of
be
devoutli
relig
is
the
lack
of
an
open
mind
just
a
point
i
suppos
if
open
mind
mean
believ
anyth
can
be
true
or
we
cant
for
sure
know
what
is
definit
true
im
happi
to
not
be
open
mind
if
howev
open
minded
mean
be
respect
and
toler
toward
other
belief
respect
the
right
and
intellig
and
wisdom
of
peopl
of
other
belief
and
give
equal
time
to
altern
idea
i
tri
my
veri
best
to
be
open
mind
just
a
thot
in
pass
anyway
i
guess
ill
get
on
with
my
question
is
anyon
in
the
same
situat
and
can
give
some
suggest
a
to
how
to
deal
with
thi
weve
taken
the
attitud
so
far
of
just
talk
about
it
a
lot
and
not
let
anyth
get
bottl
up
insid
sometim
i
get
the
feel
were
make
thi
much
bigger
than
it
actual
is
ani
comment
would
be
greatli
appreci
also
pleas
email
respons
sinc
i
dont
get
a
chanc
to
read
thi
group
often
not
be
marri
i
can
not
say
too
much
to
you
but
from
my
perspect
have
mutual
exclus
faith
would
be
a
big
enough
roadblock
for
me
in
consid
marri
someon
make
it
much
bigger
than
it
is
i
suppos
that
depend
on
how
seriou
each
of
you
is
in
your
belief
lukewarm
atheist
and
christian
for
whom
religion
is
of
nomin
import
probli
would
feel
the
issu
isnt
veri
big
i
suppos
the
more
import
your
belief
are
to
each
of
you
the
more
import
the
issu
is
paul
