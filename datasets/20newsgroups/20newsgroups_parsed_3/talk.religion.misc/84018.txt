write
for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structur
or
sound
biblic
back
for
hi
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyon
realli
care
about
the
solid
structur
of
hi
sermon
other
than
it
tell
quit
a
lot
about
the
man
himself
it
the
death
he
respons
for
that
concern
most
peopl
are
you
the
spokesman
for
most
peopl
ive
enclos
a
partial
list
of
the
sourc
he
cite
or
quot
he
exactli
use
a
a
christian
sermon
it
pretti
good
if
not
inspir
though
i
differ
in
part
on
some
of
hi
conclus
the
argument
he
present
is
well
back
which
is
whi
it
taken
me
thi
long
to
work
through
still
ongo
if
you
thought
it
wa
rambl
that
say
far
more
about
you
than
it
doe
koresh
youv
made
me
curiou
what
doe
thi
say
about
me
that
you
dont
recogn
the
biblic
commentari
use
those
in
the
church
know
the
languag
though
and
have
no
such
excus
first
seal
in
revel
the
entireti
of
psalm
and
the
most
of
revel
which
demonstr
one
of
hi
major
point
about
how
the
write
in
the
prophet
includ
david
and
in
the
psalm
and
in
revel
are
all
tell
the
same
stori
when
you
understand
how
theyr
relat
ie
have
the
key
they
larg
explain
each
other
charl
manson
use
revel
a
well
do
we
see
a
pattern
here
i
wonder
if
koresh
like
the
beatl
you
miss
the
point
which
is
that
the
prophet
the
psalm
and
revel
all
togeth
provid
a
veri
rich
view
of
a
veri
special
event
a
wed
koresh
wa
a
nut
okay
just
becaus
he
found
way
for
the
bibl
to
backup
hi
rant
doe
not
make
him
ani
le
of
a
kook
how
are
you
abl
to
make
such
a
conclus
pleas
note
that
the
first
part
of
revel
make
it
clear
that
the
address
is
to
those
in
the
church
that
said
it
doesnt
hurt
to
tri
to
see
what
the
propheci
are
ahead
of
time
for
those
outsid
the
church
seem
to
me
koresh
is
yet
anoth
messeng
that
got
kill
for
the
messag
he
carri
ill
type
thi
veri
slowli
so
that
you
can
understand
he
either
set
the
fire
himself
or
told
hi
follow
to
do
so
dont
make
him
out
to
be
a
martyr
he
did
not
get
kill
he
kill
himself
so
you
say
it
should
be
interest
to
see
what
the
investig
conclud
and
what
the
final
judgment
are
in
the
mean
time
we
sure
learn
a
lot
about
evil
and
corrupt
are
you
surpris
thing
have
gotten
that
rotten
the
evil
wa
insid
the
compound
all
that
thou
shalt
not
kill
stuff
so
much
for
war
and
govern
eh
oh
yeah
one
last
point
for
the
believ
philippian
for
the
rest
of
u
could
you
pleas
post
the
text
veri
glad
you
ask
sinc
i
goof
it
should
be
philippian
here
from
niv
becaus
of
my
chain
most
of
the
brother
in
the
lord
have
been
encourag
to
speak
the
word
of
god
more
courag
and
fearlessli
it
is
true
that
some
preach
christ
out
of
envi
and
rivalri
but
other
out
of
good
will
the
latter
do
so
in
love
know
that
i
am
put
here
for
the
gospel
the
former
preach
christ
out
of
selfish
ambit
not
sincer
suppos
that
they
can
stir
up
troubl
for
me
while
i
am
chain
but
what
doe
it
matter
the
import
thing
is
that
in
everi
way
whether
from
fals
motif
or
true
christ
is
preach
and
becaus
of
thi
i
rejoic
my
comment
stem
from
the
realiz
that
we
who
love
the
lord
are
human
and
imperfect
whatev
we
preach
no
matter
how
eloqu
or
how
corrupt
is
of
littl
differ
those
who
know
the
master
voic
will
recogn
him
a
gemston
amidst
rock
such
is
also
the
lesson
of
the
stumblingblock
for
those
who
have
an
ear
to
hear
