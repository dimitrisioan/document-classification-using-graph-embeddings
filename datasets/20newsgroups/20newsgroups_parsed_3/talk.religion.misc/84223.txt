one
ani
idea
if
it

feasabl
the
onli
way
hell
is
involv
is
that
it
is
go
to
be
a
good
ski
resort
befor
i
give
in
to
pay
for
abort
i
believ
it
is
wrong
and
i
wont
pay
for
it
without
a
gripe
im
not
for
make
them
unlaw
id
rather
spend
money
on
save
live
than
a
bunch
of
investig
and
court
hear
and
all
thi
other
crap
we
are
spend
our
time
on
you
know
who
realli
clean
up
on
all
thi
abort
stuff
lawyer
i
say
let
pas
law
to
make
adopt
cheaper
easier
and
infinit
more
support
of
the
birth
mother
let
erad
the
stigma
reduc
the
cost
pay
the
price
for
life
make
adopt
easier
on
the
birthmoth
may
help
reduc
abort
but
it
will
not
elimin
the
need
for
it
abort
is
not
done
just
becaus
the
mother
cant
care
for
the
child
and
doesnt
feel
good
about
give
it
to
stranger
abort
is
done
becaus
the
mother
can
not
afford
the
pregnanc
soapbox
off
a
person
ha
a
right
to
do
anyth
that
doe
not
interfer
with
the
right
of
anoth
person
cool
enough
youll
have
more
troubl
defin
the
term
in
that
statement
than
get
peopl
to
agre
to
it
for
exampl
i
perceiv
i
have
a
right
not
to
particip
in
what
i
feel
is
murder
i
dont
think
the
govern
should
either
on
the
other
hand
sinc
we
are
have
troubl
prove
that
it
is
murder
there
is
no
right
to
stop
someon
from
do
it
if
they
so
choos
either
by
legal
mean
or
harass
of
cours
persuas
is
allow
but
watch
that
line
between
persuas
and
harass
the
second
part
is
a
definit
of
a
person
a
simplist
explan
is
that
a
person
is
a
member
of
societi
most
normal
adult
human
be
are
good
exampl
of
peopl
most
child
over
two
year
old
are
peopl
a
well
the
simpl
way
of
determin
thi
is
that
you
can
have
a
convers
with
them
it
is
actual
more
complic
than
that
but
i
have
no
desir
to
spend
the
time
it
would
take
to
explain
it
to
you
read
the
thread
whi
is
bodili
autonomi
so
import
for
more
explan
and
justif
but
whi
is
your
definit
authorit
enough
for
the
whoe
u
sure
you
can
understand
there
are
other
definit
with
equal
right
of
consider
then
plea
justifi
whi
be
human
automat
make
someth
valuabl
and
whi
that
includ
the
unborn
if
the
govern
refus
to
fun
abort
due
to
the
qualm
of
a
minor
of
the
popul
then
it
would
then
have
to
pay
far
more
in
the
deliveri
of
babi
whose
mother
want
an
abort
but
could
not
afford
one
and
now
that
babi
will
also
requir
care
for
year
true
that
need
to
be
fix
it
is
part
of
the
problem
if
clinton
ha
a
medic
program
to
get
underway
let
him
address
thi
too
it
is
cheaper
in
the
long
run
to
save
live
later
they
will
be
product
member
of
societi
at
least
if
hi
plan
work
no
they
are
not
guarante
to
becom
product
member
of
societi
even
if
they
do
that
is
mani
year
in
the
futureuntil
which
they
are
a
burden
on
someon
or
societi
there
is
also
the
matter
of
the
mother
forc
her
to
carri
a
pregnanc
to
term
at
a
critic
time
in
her
life
could
prevent
her
from
be
a
product
member
of
societi
actual
i
wa
refer
to
the
minor
that
object
to
abort
not
those
who
object
to
feder
fund
i
admit
i
did
not
say
it
veri
clearli
and
apolog
for
that
to
refus
to
fund
abort
is
to
remov
that
choic
from
some
woman
and
add
the
addit
burden
to
societi
for
no
reason
no
thi
is
realli
flaw
logic
it
would
be
like
me
say
i
wa
born
with
a
disfigur
face
and
i
want
cosmet
repair
it
is
discriminatori
that
i
can
not
make
that
choic
and
so
you
must
pay
for
it
that
a
person
ha
a
right
to
make
a
choic
doe
not
impli
legal
or
otherwis
that
someon
el
should
foot
the
bill
sic
for
that
choic
ok
look
it
like
thi
we
are
foot
the
bill
mayb
they
will
take
choic
a
mayb
they
will
take
choic
b
mayb
they
will
take
choic
c
they
cant
afford
ani
one
of
them
if
they
take
choic
a
wed
have
to
pay
them
say
if
they
take
choic
b
it
would
cost
u
if
they
take
choic
c
it
will
cost
u
now
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
for
the
next
year
which
one
sound
the
most
realist
for
u
to
be
will
to
pay
for
now
some
peopl
happen
not
to
like
choic
a
other
peopl
happen
not
to
like
choic
c
pay
for
it
that
is
c
ha
been
around
and
paid
for
for
year
even
though
it
mean
we
spend
a
lot
of
money
we
cant
in
conscienc
refus
to
pay
for
it
now
a
ha
been
around
and
is
perfectli
legal
but
it
hasnt
been
fund
in
the
past
now
a
is
go
to
be
fund
but
some
peopl
object
they
dont
like
the
idea
of
their
tax
money
go
to
pay
for
choic
a
so
we
could
refus
to
fund
a
at
all
then
those
woman
who
cant
afford
ani
of
those
choic
will
be
forc
to
take
choic
b
or
c
which
will
cost
all
of
u
more
money
most
of
u
dont
see
ani
reason
at
all
whi
more
money
should
be
spent
to
the
effect
of
remov
person
choic
from
some
woman
the
altern
is
to
fund
a
if
that
is
what
the
mother
choos
we
will
also
still
fund
b
and
even
c
if
that
is
what
the
mother
choos
howev
some
woman
will
certainli
choos
a
and
that
will
then
save
u
we
otherwis
would
have
had
to
spend
your
tax
are
not
be
rais
to
fund
a
choic
you
object
they
are
be
lower
becaus
we
will
fund
a
choic
that
is
legal
despit
your
object
to
it
actual
your
tax
are
not
realli
go
to
go
down
a
im
sure
you
would
point
out
but
the
amount
that
is
save
in
that
area
can
help
out
in
anotherlik
our
massiv
debt
if
you
disagre
then
give
u
some
reason
given
that
abort
is
legal
and
the
right
to
abort
is
support
by
the
major
of
the
popul
it
is
not
justifi
to
refus
abort
to
woman
who
can
not
afford
them
who
will
simpli
requir
even
greater
fund
for
the
deliveri
you
would
forc
upon
them
i
refus
to
pay
more
tax
to
remov
choic
from
those
woman
just
becaus
you
object
to
a
legal
medic
procedur
what
i
say
object
to
the
procedur
is
irrelev
uncl
bill
doesnt
pay
for
breast
augment
facelift
etc
whi
abort
it
elect
surgeri
those
other
procedur
you
mention
onli
cost
money
there
is
no
save
in
other
procedur
that
would
be
requir
down
the
road
without
them
in
fact
there
could
be
addit
cost
down
the
road
becaus
of
them
thi
is
quit
differ
from
the
case
of
abort
a
for
your
argument
you
are
entic
a
young
girl
to
kill
a
babi
by
make
it
afford
and
refus
to
make
the
altern
afford
too
so
you
are
just
a
guilti
of
remov
a
choic
by
withhold
fund
think
about
it
a
poor
girl
is
pregnant
and
abort
are
feder
fund
what
she
gon
na
do
what
choic
have
your
plan
given
her
your
kind
of
doubl
talk
realli
make
me
ill
thi
is
bullshit
we
are
not
refus
to
make
the
altern
afford
too
if
we
refus
to
pay
for
the
more
expens
choic
of
birth
then
your
statement
would
make
sen
but
that
is
not
the
case
so
it
doesnt
if
clinton
tri
to
block
fund
for
prenat
care
and
deliveri
or
left
it
out
of
hi
healthcar
plan
i
would
certainli
object
i
would
also
be
quit
surpris
prochoic
ha
proabort
realli
fit
in
your
case
ye
but
probabl
not
your
definit
of
it
or
for
the
reason
you
think
if
your
gon
na
fund
one
choic
you
have
to
fund
them
all
at
the
veri
least
you
stupid
fuck
we
do
want
to
fund
all
the
choic
you
are
the
one
who
want
to
not
fund
all
the
choic
imho
if
we
fund
the
adopt
choic
right
mean
not
just
throw
money
at
it
but
cut
cost
esp
legal
cost
we
wont
need
abort
anymor
your
humbl
opinion
is
still
wrong
even
with
easi
adopt
there
is
still
the
fact
that
pregnanc
take
sever
month
month
in
which
a
young
woman
could
need
to
be
get
an
educ
like
finish
high
school
enter
colleg
finish
colleg
get
a
jobth
that
are
much
harder
to
do
if
you
have
to
take
a
break
for
a
few
monthsth
that
have
a
massiv
impact
on
her
futur
product

a
right
to
life
a
fetu

not
a
person
you
can
not
have
a
convers
with

ah
let
kill
the
mental
incompet
a
well
or
how
about
peopl
we
just
dont
like
sinc
we
cant
have
a
convers
with
them
you
can
have
a
convers
with
the
mental
incompet
and
even
though
you
person
may
refus
to
have
a
convers
with
peopl
you
just
dont
like
it
is
still
possibl
for
other
to
have
a

it
is
not
possibl
for
anyon
to
have
a

aha
you
admit
it
is
question
yet
you
are
will
to
kill
it
even
if
it
may
be
veri
awar
i
suggest
you
rethink
your
viewpoint
awar
is
onli
part
of
what
make
a
member
of
societi
it
is
the
minim
conceiv
requir
yet
mani
peopl
seem
to
think
that
someth
without
awar
could
still
be
import
enough
to
justifi
the
suffer
of
a
true
member
of
societi
i
keep
ask
but
i
still
havent
seen
a
real
justif
for
whi
the
life
of
a
nonsenti
creatur
should
be
worth
the
suffer
of
a
sentient
be
i
havent
read
everi
respons
on
the
thread
ive
been
ask
on
yet
so
well
see
if
i
see
one
later
they
have
no
experi
in
the
real
world
to
make
up
a

thi
is
also
true
of
quit
a
