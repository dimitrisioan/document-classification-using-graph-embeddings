until
later
that
christ
rose
from

if
christ
himself
wa
not
in

until
sunday
how
could
the
repent
thief
have
been
there
with
him
the
answer
lie
in
the
locat
of
paradis
when
jesu
die
appar
paradis
wa
not
exalt
to

until
easter
day
jesu
refer
to

redeem
wait
till
the

wa
not
yet
lift
to

but
it
may
well
have
been
a
section
of
hade
hebrew
sheol
reserv
for
believ
who
had
die
in
the
faith
but
would
not
be
admit
into
the
gloriou
presenc
of
god
in
heaven
until
the
price
of
redempt
had
actual
been
paid
on
calvari
or
even
that
none
would
preced
the
presenc
of
jesu
back
to
glori
with
the
father
doubtless
it
wa
the
infern
paradis
that
the
soul
of
jesu
and
the
repent

repair
after
they
each
die
on
friday

ra
whenev
your
person
interpret
of
biblic
passag
is
ra
challeng
your
onli
respons
seem
to
be
that
one
need
mere
to
ra
look
at
the
bibl
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblic
thing
differ
from
you
i
think
that
thi
character
is
faulti
whenev
my
person
interpret
is
question
i
usual
give
a
reason
a
for
those
that
see
thing
differ
pleas
put
forward
where
there
is
a
valid
differ
and
we
can
discu
it
i
seem
to
be
see
from
you
the
notion
that
ani
differ
in
how
one
view
the
bibl
is
somehow
legitim
except
or
cours
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrari
view
and
perhap
we
can
have
a
discuss
on
that
topic
but
to
decri
someth
that
i
put
forward
without
put
forward
someth
els
to
discu
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
give
credenc
to
other
alleg
view
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simpli
be
contenti
ra
are
we
to
simpli
assum
that
you
are
the
onli
one
who
realli
ra
understand
it
if
you
believ
that
someth
that
i
have
drawn
from
scriptur
is
wrong
then
pleas
show
me
from
scriptur
where
it
is
wrong
