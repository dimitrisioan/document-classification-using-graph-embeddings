greek
is
wellknown

wellunderstood
have
you
consid
josephu
the
jewish
historian
who
also
wrote
of
jesu
in
addit
the
four
gospel
account
are
veri
much
in
harmoni
bill
i
have
taken
the
time
to
explain
that
biblic
scholar
consid
the
josephu
refer
to
be
an
earli
christian
insert
by
biblic
scholar
i
mean
an
expert
who
in
the
cours
of
hi
or
her
research
is
will
to
let
the
chip
fall
where
they
may
thi
exclud
literalist
who
may
otherwis
be
defin
a
biblic
apologist
they
find
what
they
want
to
find
they
are
not
trustworthi
by
scholarli
standard
and
other
whi
an
insert
read
it
i
have
a
number
of
time
the
passag
is
glaringli
out
of
context
and
josephu
a
superb
writer
had
no
such
problem
elsewher
in
hi
work
the
passag
ha
noth
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
in
which
it
lie
it
suddenli
appear
and
then
just
a
quickli
disappear
until
you
can
demonstr
how
and
whi
the
scholarli
commun
is
wrong
about
the
josephu
insert
your
proof
is
meaningless
and
it
should
not
be
repeat
here
what
more
even
if
josephu
happen
to
be
legitim
it
would
prove
noth
scholar
speak
of
the
weight
of
evid
far
more
independ
evid
would
be
requir
to
valid
your
claim
until
forthcom
your
belief
is
base
on
faith
that
ok
but
you
exceed
your
right
when
you
pas
faith
off
a
fact
a
for
the
gospel
there
are
parallel
but
there
are
also
glare
inconsist
and
contradict
shouldnt
a
perfect
canon
be
perfect
shouldnt
there
be
absolut
no
room
for
debat
i
suggest
you
read
gospel
fiction
by
randel
helm
and
the
unauthor
version
by
robin
fox
for
herb
huston
no
known
kinship
or
famili
relationship
but
we
do
inde
share
an
evolutionari
ancestri
the
fact
that
there
are
inconsist
gap
and
contradict
doe
not
deni
your
posit
on
the
other
hand
neither
do
the
gospel
prove
your
faith
independ
evid
is
necessari
and
i
know
of
none
which
we
have
alreadi
discus
and
so
far
you
have
not
provid
ani
until
then
it
faith
moreov
you
have
commit
a
fundament
error
in
logic
you
have
attempt
to
prove
your
claim
with
that
which
you
want
to
prove
it
no
differ
than
say
i
am
right
becaus
i
say
so
your
logic
is
full
of
