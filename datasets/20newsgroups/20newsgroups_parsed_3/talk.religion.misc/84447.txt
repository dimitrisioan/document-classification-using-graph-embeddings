so
you
see
brian
we
have
a
few
origin
manuscript
record
the
miracul
battl
between
the
rams
and
the
hittit
do
you
reject
them
a
be
complet
true
i
suspect
you
do
and
if
so
then
do
you
also
in
your
own
word
question
the
exist
of
alexand
the
great
tilgrath
pilisar
iii
nero
caligula
josephu
cyru
the
great
artexerx
do
you
also
therebi
question
all
their
document
that
the
problem
with
your
all
or
noth
approach
mani
ancient
peopl
use
to
mix
a
bit
of
fanci
with
their
fact
so
for
you
to
say
that
we
must
either
accept
all
of
peter
and
the
rest
of
the
new
testament
or
accept
no
record
of
antiqu
at
all
forc
you
therebi
to
accept
the
veriti
of
document
you
probabl
do
not
find
complet
credibl
a
to
your
other
argument
that
so
mani
peopl
have
testifi
to
jesu
that
he
must
be
true
are
you
go
to
just
pa
off
all
thi
testimoni
a
fictious
are
you
go
to
call
three
thousand
year
worth
of
testimoni
from
shepherd
to
ir
agent
to
royal
offici
to
king
to
comput
programm
fiction
with
a
scoff
of
your
keyboard
with
near
complet
ignor
of
the
testimoni
are
you
go
to
say
that
that
is
all
complet
hooey
would
that
not
be
the
most
audaci
display
of
arrog
do
you
actual
think
you
know
better
than
king
solomon
king
david
or
even
abraham
lincoln
i
have
three
point
first
thi
is
argumentum
ad
populum
ie
appeal
to
popular
opinion
you
can
not
vote
on
truth
for
instanc
do
the
million
of
hindu
past
and
present
who
testifi
to
the
realiti
of
brahma
constitut
actual
evid
for
the
exist
of
brahma
how
would
you
answer
your
own
question
in
regard
to
the
testimoni
of
hindu
with
a
scoff
of
your
keyboard
with
near
complet
ignor
of
the
testimoni
are
you
go
to
say
that
that
is
all
complet
hooey
if
you
do
so
scoff
then
how
do
you
object
justifi
your
own
special
plead
second
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
king
solomon
or
king
david
testifi
to
jesu
you
can
claim
it
to
be
clear
but
that
doe
not
make
it
true
third
it
is
quit
arguabl
that
abraham
lincoln
wa
not
christian
and
that
he
had
both
a
public
and
a
privat
view
of
christian
in
fact
there
wa
much
discuss
about
it
in
hi
day
ye
he
wa
public
accus
of
be
a
deist
oh
my
i
am
present
collect
a
faq
for
lincoln
a
ive
previous
done
for
tyre
jefferson
and
etc
later
dave
butler
my
earlier
view
of
the
unsound
of
the
christian
scheme
of
salvat
and
the
human
origin
of
the
scriptur
have
becom
clearer
and
stronger
with
advanc
year
and
i
see
no
reason
for
think
i
shall
ever
chang
them
abraham
lincoln
to
judg
j
s
wakefield
after
the
death
of
willi
lincoln
