almost
univers
a

curiou
a
to

who
toss
out
the

undoubtedli
a
few
naiv
atheist
do
thi
but
the
phrase
of
the
question
abov
seem
to
suggest
that
cobb
ascrib
thi
more
broadli
perhap
the
question
that
get
more
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
whi
except
for
some
naiv
believ
who
unfortun
far
outnumb
nonbeliev
both
naiv
and
critic
are
the
gospel
not
taken
a
gospel
truth
that
faith
record
just
what
happen
two
thousand
year
ago
thi
ha
an
easi
answer
and
the
answer
ha
noth
to
do
with
miracl
no
text
is
taken
thi
way
by
a
critic
reader
there
is
a
myth
among
some
naiv
believ
that
one
take
a
text
measur
it
by
some
set
of
criterion
and
then
either
confirm
the
text
a
histor
valid
or
toss
out
the
text
i
suspect
thi
myth
come
from
the
way
histori
is
present
in
primari
and
secondari
school
where
certain
text
are
vest
with
author
and
from

such
a
josh
mcdowel
who
pretend
to
present

argument
along
these
line
for
their
religi
program
in
fact
most
text
use
in
primari

secondari
school
histori
class
ought
to
be
toss

even
the
better
such

should
not
be
treat
a

a

abov
and
josh
mcdowel
would
not
know
a

argument
if
it
bit
him
on
the
keister
twice
let
me
present
the
barest
outlin
of
a
differ
view
of

their
use
in
studi
histori
first
all

are
histor
valid
all

to
put
thi
anoth
way
i
have
never
seen
a
notion
of

that
make
ani
sens
when
appli
to

second
no

be
read
a
tell
the
