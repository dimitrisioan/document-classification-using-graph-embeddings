xmdrawingarea
for
draw
with

but
i
would
like
to
take
advantag
of
the
graphic
librari
gl
avail
on
our
ibm
r
sgi
gl
i
believ
is
it
possibl
to
mix
x
and
gl
in
one
applic
program
can
i
use
gl
subroutin
in
an
xmdrawingarea
or
in
an
x
window
open
by
me
with
xopenwindow
you
cant
make
gl
call
in
an
xmdrawingarea
widget
for
sure
there
is
a
widget
alreadi
defin
for
gl
it
is
the
glxmdraw
motif
or
glxdraw
athena
widget
it
is
similar
to
a
xmdrawingarea
except
that
it
allow
you
to
use
gl
call
to
render
into
the
window
look
at
glxlink
glxunlink
glxgetconfig
and
glxwinset
in
the
man
page
the
glxmdraw
widget
work
pretti
well
opengl
will
be
an
improv
i
can
vouch
for
that
the
gl
widget
work
pretti
well
i
have
been
use
it
for
sometim
now
im
not
sure
though
whether
you
can
use
xlib
call
to
draw
into
the
gl
widget
i
havent
tri
it
yet
nor
have
i
read
the
accompani
document
complet
tri
post
to
compsyssgi
for
more
inform
better
stillyou
will
find
most
of
the
answer
in
the
sgi
manual
there
is
a
littl
transit
guid
which
explain
the
mixedmodel
program
paradigmmix
x
and
gl
doe
pex
graphig
have
the
same
function
of
gl
i
think
gl
is
a
littl
easier
to
use
and
a
littl
more
power
but
that
just
an
opinion
mileag
may
vari
well
pex
is
design
a
an
extens
to
x
and
will
be
more
seamless
but
then
it
is
buggi
to
start
with
opinion
again
