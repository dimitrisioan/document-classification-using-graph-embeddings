in

that
us
the

to
refer

microsoft

perhap
the
time
ha
come
to
accept
x
window
a
a
valid
term
for

i
think
that
thi
is
a
more
concis
and
unclutt
term
than
say
the
x
window
system
and
let
face
it
almost
everyon

we
all
need

will
help
when

it
sad
i
thought
i
wa
a

inde
it
is
unfortun
that
x
did
not
becom

let
m
worri
about
whether
it
should
be
call
microsoft

or
the
microsoft

system
or
how
about
just
plain
microsoft
to
summaris
or
should
that
be
summar
the
point
of
thi
messag
i
think
there
are
far
more
press
issu
face
the
x
commun
than
worri
about
subtl
distinct
in
the
name
of
the
window

or
should
that
be
window

whatev
get
recognis
is
fine
by
me
i
agre
that

should
be
care
in

i
would
be
reluct
to
