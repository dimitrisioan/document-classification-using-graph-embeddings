write
im
write
an
x
server
for
some
videogener
equip
the
hardwar
is
truecolor
in
yuv
space
in
x
term
it
ha
a
bit
static
color
visual
i
would
realli
like
to
have
the
server
just
present
thi
static
visual
but
im
not
sure
if
thi
will
be
accept
to
most
x
client
the
three
problem
i
see
are
the
colormap
though
huge
is
static
all
pixel
would
be
byte
wide
becaus
the
hardwar
actual
live
in
yuv
space
the
translat
rgbyuv
will
introduc
some
round
error
be
more
of
a
server
guy
than
a
client
guy
i
ask
will
these
limit
thwart
mani
x
client
or
will
most
of
the
x
stuff
float
around
blith
accept
what
theyr
given
i
could
write
the
server
to
also
present
a
pseudocolor
visual
of
eg
bit
but
id
rather
avoid
thi
if
not
necessari
even
bit
truecolor
machin
are
in
most
case
run
an
emul
bit
pseudocolor
visual
onli
to
get
standard
x
client
motif
app
and
thelik
to
run
i
strongli
suppos
you
to
emul
at
least
bit
truecolor
should
be
no
problem
onli
some
translat
round
should
not
make
big
misfit
bit
pseudocolor
more
of
a
problem
you
have
to
emul
a
colormap
pixel
indic
convers
stuff
furthermor
you
should
run
your
default
screen
on
thi
