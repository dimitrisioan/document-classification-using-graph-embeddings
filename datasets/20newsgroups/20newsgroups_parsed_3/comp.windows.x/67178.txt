suggest
lobbi
to
get
the
xlib
semant
chang
to
support
the
featur
i

otherwis
chang
the
document
for

acceler
to
properli
set
the
user
expect
becaus
menu
acceler
are
not
the
same
thing
a
translat
is
it
possibl
to
suppli
acceler
for
a

entri
if

mean
menu
acceler
no
it
not
possibl
that
accord
to
the
definit
of
the
xmnacceler
resourc
in
the
xmlabel
manual
page
keep
in
mind
when
answer
thi
question
that
when
use
motif
you
cant
use
xtinstallacceler
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
whi
not
how
can
you
ensur
that
acceler
work
the
same
independ
of
case
what
i
want
is
ctrlo
and
ctrlo
to
both
be
acceler
on
one
menu
entri
there
is
a
workaround
for
motif
user
in
addit
to
the
normal
menu
acceler
you
instal
on
the
xmpushbuttongadget
set
an
xtnacceler
resourc
on
the
shell
toplevel
or
applic
instal
the
shell
acceler
on
itself
and
all
of
it
descend
with

you
have
to
write
and
add
the
applic
action
performact
which
you
can
implement
by
use
xtnametowidget
on
the
first
argument
and
then
xtcallactionproc
with
the
rest
of
the
argument
i
test
out
someth
similar
to
thi
to
shorten
develop
time
i
use
teleus
tuninstallacceler
resourc
to
instal
the
acceler
on
the
shell
and
i
directli
invok
the
open
and
quit
d
action
instead
of
ask
the
pushbutton
to
do
it
for
me
but
the
more
