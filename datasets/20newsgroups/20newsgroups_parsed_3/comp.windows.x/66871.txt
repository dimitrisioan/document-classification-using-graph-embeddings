some
delet
if
you
look
close
at
motif
you
will
see
that
it
is
just
mswindow
with
more
eyepleas
color
and
textur
the
onli
real
differ
is
that
an
m
applic
window
can
contain
other
toplevel
child
while
a
motif
applic
window
launch
it
child
out
onto
the
desktop
aab
to
those
of
you
familiar
with
both
gui
is
thi
correct
my
experi
aab
with
x
make
me
think
that
thi
msw
behavior
is
easili
duplic
aab
with
x
but
i
dont
know
msw
anoth
import
differ
is
that
msw
doesnt
have
ani
window
that
handl
sophist
geometri
manag
like
xmform
also
i
believ
that
in
window
x
your
limit
to
k
of
resourc
window
menu
icon
etc
imho
thi
whole
discuss
name
motif
look
like
mswindog
is
total
stupid
the
onli
thing
remot
influenc
here
can
be
the
motif
window
manag
that
featur
an
arrang
of
button
and
menu
somewhat
similiar
to
thi
of
the
msw
windowmanag
agent
howev
it
name
is
but
mwm
is
onli
a
small
part
of
motif
in
fact
mwm
and
motif
can
work
without
each
other
and
if
one
doesnt
like
mwm
outfit
for
some
reason
he
switch
to
anoth
windowmanag
all
thi
doesnt
influenc
motif
which
is
a
toolkit
of
widget
to
write
applic
and
thi
toolkit
is
imho
uncompar
to
msw
becaus
it
is
much
more
wellorgan
and
featur
alot
of
goodi
more
than
the
msw
interfac
you
can
not
say
a
porsch
look
like
a
vw
käfer
onli
becaus
they
have
the
wheel
and
the
gear
at
the

motif
and
msw
are
complet

onli
