ive
final
decid
to
rewrit
everyth
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
togeth
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimag
is
consider
slower
factor
of
on
averag
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
move
imag
data
from
memori
pixrect
to
a
canva
thi
wa
on
a
sparc

is
slow
thing
down
or
xputimag
is
inefficientor

case
i
might
a
well
give

the
fastest
way
is
to
use
an
x
server
with
share
memori
extens
it
us
share
memori
if
it
is
a
local
x
server
henc
imag
dont
have
to
be
duplic

default
to
the
regular
imag
routin
if
