i
am
repost
thi
becaus
i
am
not
sure
my
first
post
ever
made
it
out
i
have
built
and
instal
xr
on
my
sparcstat
my
aim
is
to
run
the
mit
x
server
but
retain
the
openlook
window
manag
i
am
sure
thi
is
not
uncommon
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
chang
andor
delet
everyth
that
i
need
to
for
instanc
i
can
start
xdm
in
rclocal
but
how
do
i
get
rid
of
xnew
the
openlook
window
manag
sourc
is
avail
on
the
mit
contrib
tape
or
from
exportlcsmitedu
i
would
suggest
build
thi
too
rather
than
use
the
version
from
openwindow
it
is
olwm
v
i
would
suggest
skip
olwm
and
get
olvwm
instead
thi
version
of
the
olwm
window
manag
implement
a
virtual
desktop
that
i
find
realli
handi
even
on
larg
monitor
thi
version
is
also
avail
at
exportlcsmiteducontribolvwmtarz
the
readm
file
also
suggest
get
the
file
in
contribxview
in
my
case
i
built
the
x
server
first
xview
second
then
olvwm
all
of
these
were
instal
into
usrx
onc
i
verifi
the
server
work
correctli
i
happili
issu
rm
rf
usropenwin
use
gcc
to
build
all
of
the
abov
result
in
a
window
system
that
is
for
all
intent
and
purpos
ident
to
openwindow
and
that
is
incred
faster
there
is
a
bit
of
tweak
you
will
have
to
do
if
you
want
thing
to
work
exactli
like
openwindow
but
not
much
