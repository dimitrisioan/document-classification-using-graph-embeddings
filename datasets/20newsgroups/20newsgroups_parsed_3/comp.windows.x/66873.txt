studi
do
user
want
to
build
solut
let
me
point
out
that
both
guibas
wordprocessor
and
textbas
formatt
both
have
a
languag
one
happen
to
be
mous
and
actionbas
and
the
other
symbolbas
true
but
that
besid
the
point
thi
is
a
fact
about
an
abstract
model
of
what
the
gui
user
are
do
not
about
what
they
actual
are
do
thi
abstract
model
is
onli
appar
from
the
perpect
of
a
programm
of
the
system
nb
some
user
may
see
it
too
but
onli
when
they
put
asid
the
work
at
hand
and
start
think
like
a
programm
im
not
say
that
the
programm
perspect
is
evil
or
stunt
after
all
that
what
i
do
too
i
am
say
that
ui
design
must
care
distinguish
between
the
userprogramm
conceptu
model
and
they
must
ultim
serv
the
user
of
the
system
not
the
builder
of
the
system
i
dont
recal
the
actual
stat
but
someth
like
in
peopl
can
be
categor
a
a
symbol
manipul
it
would
be
interest
to
know
more
about
the
mean
and
basi
for
thi
claim
at
ani
rate
i
dont
think
thi
is
evid
that
of
user
think
like
programm
banker
financi
analyst
structur
engin
these
are
all
peopl
whose
work
you
could
character
a
primarili
symbol
manipul
but
what
they
do
is
not
program
and
program
is
not
requir
to
do
what
they
do
to
restat
my
previou
point
ye
user
want
to
build
their
own
solut
no
they
do
not
want
to
do
program
to
accomplish
