c

write
im
work
on
an
xr
applic
and
have
concern
regard
standard
colormap
the
xr
document
say
usual
a
window
manag
creat
these
colormap
i
wonder
what
window
manag
the
writer
had
in
mind
neither
twm
or
mwm
seem
to
creat
standard
colormap
standard
colormap
were
specd
with
the
intent
that
window
manag
would
make
them
avail
thi
doesnt
mean
that
everi
window
manag
author
in
the
world
immedi
drop
everyth
they
were
do
and
implement
thi
at
top
prioriti
the
esg
server
we
ship
make
the
xargbbestmap
avail
at
startup
it
doesnt
wait
for
window
manag
to
do
it
of
cours
one
can
use
xstdcmap
to
creat
standard
colormap
howev
xstdcmap
doesnt
seem
to
tri
veri
hard
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
default
colormap
when
i
use
standard
colormap
creat
by
xstdcmap
the
rest
of
my
display
go
black
so
it
seem
a
if
use
of
standard
colormap
caus
the
veri
problem
standard
colormap
are
intend
to
avoid
perhap
if
everi
applic
use
standard
colormap
thing
would
be
wonder
but
not
mani
applic
seem
to
use
standard
colormap
doe
your
hardwar
have
onli
one
clut
sinc
standard
colormap
typic
devour
all
entri
there
is
no
way
it
can
avoid
displac
the
entir
default
colormap
if
your
hardwar
ha
onli
one
clut
i
dont
believ
standard
colormap
are
intend
to
aboid
possibl
colormap
flash
between
client
use
the
default
coilormap
rather
colormap
flash
will
be
avoid
between
two
client
that
use
the
same
standard
colormap
an
exampl
would
be
two
client
that
need
a
full
color
rang
would
both
use
xargbbestmap
or
whatev
it
call
under
xr
if
you
are
tri
to
avoid
colormap
flash
with
the
default
colormap
your
best
bet
is
to
tri
to
load
all
the
color
you
use
into
that
colormap
if
you
cant
do
that
then
youll
get
flash
on
a
one
hw
clut
framebuff
now
if
your
window
manag
use
the
same
standard
colormap
a
your
client
thi
flash
could
also
be
avoid
perhap
some
window
manag
have
command
line
option
for
select
standard
colormap
