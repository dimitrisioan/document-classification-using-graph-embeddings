year
ago
i
wrote
a
sunview
applic
for
fast
anim
of
raster
file
with
sunview
becom
rapidli
obselet
ive
final
decid
to
rewrit
everyth
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
togeth
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimag
is
consider
slower
factor
of
on
averag
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
move
imag
data
from
memori
pixrect
to
a
canva
thi
wa
on
a
sparc
ipx
it
seem
that
the
x
protocol
commun
is
slow
thing
down
or
xputimag
is
inefficientor
both
my
question
is
what
the
protocol
ha
to
move
the
whole
imag
from
process
memori
to
server
memori
thi
is
the
hog
the
convers
in
the
xputimag
are
fast
is
the
fastest
way
in
xr
to
dump
plane
imag
data
to
a
window
can
i
take
advantag
of
the
fact
that
the
client
is
run
on
the
same
machin
a
the
server
or
am
i
stuck
with
ye
by
util
the
mitshm
extens
that
provid
an
xputimag
deriv
that
use
share
memori
fine
fast
xputimag
in
which
case
i
might
a
well
give
up
now
no
you
can
still
xputimag
all
of
the
frame
onto
pixmap
thu
move
them
to
server
memori
and
then
replay
them
fastest
use
xcopyarea
but
be
awar
thi
is
a
major
server
memori
bummer
