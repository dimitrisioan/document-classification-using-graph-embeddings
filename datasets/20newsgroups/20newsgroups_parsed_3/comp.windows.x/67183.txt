kisseberth
look
interest
but
i
need
someon
to
point
me
to
some
document
is
thi
method
like
to
give
better
result
than
server
resid
pixmap
id
also
be
interest
in
look
at
the
xview
code
mention
abov
there
document
on
how
to
use
the
share
memori
extens
in
the
xr
distribut
actual
i
just
finish
write
a
motif
anim
program
takelotsofimagedataanddisplayitprettydarnfast
when
use
onserv
pixmap
or
share
memori
i
had
to
insert
a
delay
loop
to
keep
it
from
go
too
quickli
test
both
method
side
by
side
they
were
just
about
equal
the
advantag
of
shm
is
that
your
x
server
doesnt
grow
to
ridicul
size
but
pixmap
can
work
over
a
network
and
are
remov
if
your
applic
die
one
tend
to
use
ipcrm
manual
quit
a
bit
when
debug
shm
app
share
memori
also
ha
the
problem
that
some
oper
system
eg
ultrix
seem
to
allow
onli
a
small
number
of
segment
to
be
attach
to
a
process
at
onc
consequ
a
redraw
becom
xshmattachxshmputimagexshmdetach
on
dec
system
and
dec
bit
display
like
the
one
i
tend
to
use
most
often
dont
seem
to
support
the
extens
mayb
someon
compil
them
wrong
and
use
pixmap
caus
the
x
server
to
crash
fail
malloc
so
one
ha
to
use
the
local
unix
domain
socket
which
realli
isnt
that
bad
one
copi
the
info
three
time
per
redraw
instead
of
one
in
short
allow
all
three
form
of
display
within
the
program
is
a
good
thing
minu
shm
if
run
over
a
network
and
let
the
user
pick
whatev
feel
fastest
i
just
use
an
ximagehandl
class
and
forget
about
it
