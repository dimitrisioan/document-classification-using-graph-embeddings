hi
all
thi
is
the
first
time
ive
post
to
the
net
so
i
hope
thi
is
go
to
the
right
peopl
im
look
for
softwar
packag
that
run
on
an
ibm
pc
clone
that
allow
me
to
display
openlook
and
motif
window
on
the
pc
the
idea
is
to
use
the
pc
a
a
cheap
x
window
termin
for
use
by
process
engin
at
work
if
you
alreadi
own
all
the
clone
equip
then
there
are
lot
of
such
program
see
a
current
copi
of
unix
world
magazin
but
your
perform
will
suck
lemon
run
an
xserver
on
a
clone
from
experi
you
would
be
much
better
off
with
an
xtermin
if
thi
is
a
new
instal
the
perform
will
be
at
least
four
time
better
in
addit
it
would
be
much
easier
to
instal
and
use
on
top
of
that
they
will
cost
about
the
same
price
a
clone
with
mb
ram
ethernet
card
veri
high
perform
graphic
card
good
monitor
server
softwar
tcpip
for
clone
softwar
mous
keyboard
etc
etc
etc
you
spend
a
whole
lot
of
i
can
get
tektronix
xp
termin
for
under
and
the
perform
is
over
