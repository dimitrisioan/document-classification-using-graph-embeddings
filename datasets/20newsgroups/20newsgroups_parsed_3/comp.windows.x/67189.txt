my
solut
is
xcreatewindow
xsetwmproperti
xmapwindow
xflush
xmovewindow
thi
code
will
almost
certainli
break
call
xmapwindow
and
then
xflush
doe
not
guarante
that
the
window
is
visibl
and
manag
by
the
window
manag
even
if
thi
did
work
there
isnt
a
reliabl
way
to
find
out
how
much
decor
the
window
manag
place
around
your
window
so
you
dont
know
how
far
to
move
it
and
what
if
the
window
manag
refus
to
