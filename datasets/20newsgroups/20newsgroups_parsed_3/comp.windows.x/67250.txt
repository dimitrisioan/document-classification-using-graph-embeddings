david
young
write
i
have
an
applicationshel
which
use
a
colormap
creat
with
xcreatecolormap
and
use
all
of
the
color
avail
for
my
bit
displaywhen
i
popup
a
dialogshel
to
prompt
the
user
for
some
input
i
want
the
xmndialogstyl
to
be
set
to
xmdialogprimaryapplicationmod
the
result
is
that
if
my
cursor
is
over
the
dialogshel
i
get
my
colormap
but
if
the
cursor
is
over
the
applicationshel
or
ani
window
other
than
the
dialogshel
i
get
the
default
colormap
but
id
like
it
so
that
if
my
cursor
is
over
ani
window
of
my
applic
i
get
my
colormap
i
think
thi
is
correct
behavior
rememb
the
default
colormapfocuspolici
is
keyboard
mean
the
cmap
focu
follow
the
keyboard
focu
sinc
the
dialog
is
modal
mwm
wont
allow
keyboard
focu
onto
your
main
shell
and
so
it
wont
allow
cmap
focu
either
sinc
it
sound
a
though
you
have
keyboardfocuspolicypoint
i
suggest
you
set
colormapfocuspolicypoint
also
that
way
the
cmap
focu
wont
slavishli
follow
keyboard
focu
but
will
beat
it
own
path
if
you
have
keyboardfocuspolici
explicit
you
can
set
cmap
focu
explicit
also
but
you
then
need
a
bind
to
ffocuscolor
