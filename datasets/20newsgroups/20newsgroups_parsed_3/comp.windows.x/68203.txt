said
me
a
is
emu
wont
work
on
bsd
deriv
system
eg
sun
with
me
anyth
els
than
a
csh
there
is
a
fix
to
thi
which
is
veri
me
short
remov
one
line
of
code
ill
put
thi
on
export
today
it
more
than
that
actual
in
the
version
on
export
one
can
not
just
specifi
a
posix
tti
behaviour
the
posix
config
file
are
incomplet
without
those
of
some
specif
platform
like
sun
and
dec
i
look
twice
at
port
emu
to
linux
but
stop
short
becus
of
the
tti
part
is
there
a
cleaner
version
of
emu
that
support
posix
tti
explicitli
hmm
depend
on
how
you
defin
clean
jordan
implement
the
system
depend
stuff
in
a
way
that
you
have
basic
implement
for
call
it
oper
system
type
then
you
go
ahead
and
write
a
includ
file
for
your
specif
machin
or
oper
system
use
the
basic
implement
sinc
both
jordan
and
i
havent
encount
a
o
flavor
yet
that
is
fulli
posix
we
havent
gotten
around
to
realli
implement
and
test
a
toplevel
includ
file
specif
for
just
posix
the
posix
routin
are
use
in
the
sun
specif
file
ttysuni
for
exampl
but
here
we
also
use
some
bsd
stuff
all
in
all
it
still
is
probabl
better
to
implement
a
includ
file
for
each
and
everi
oper
system
than
ifdef
in
exist
one
the
type
of
mess
that
can
result
from
that
can
clearli
be
seen
in
the
xterm
sourc
even
if
quit
a
bit
of
code
get
copi
almost
unchang
a
coupl
of
time
thi
onli
us
up
some
disk
space
sinc
onli
the
driver
actual
includ
from
the
toplevel
includ
file
will
be
compil
into
emu
it
shouldnt
be
hard
to
come
up
with
a
ttylinuxi
file
that
fulli
reli
on
the
posix
stuff
but
unfortun
i
dont
have
a
linux
system
avail
to
me
so
i
cant
do
the
port
myself
i
would
suggest
you
read
the
readm
in
termsysdep
and
if
you
have
ani
problem
or
question
contact
me
and
we
could
tri
to
sort
thi
out
unfortun
we
have
to
reli
on
help
from
the
net
on
thi
part
of
emu
sinc
we
just
dont
have
access
to
that
mani
differ
system
