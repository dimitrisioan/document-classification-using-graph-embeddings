how
to
see
characterset
from
wchart
we
develop
a
toolkit
run
on
the
x
window
system
the
toolkit
cope
with
ani
languag
base
on
xr
in
facil
a
you
know
there
are
kind
of
in
implement
from
mit
xr
releas
xsi
and
ximp
our
origin
implement
of
the
toolkit
us
xsi
our
toolkit
manag
each
charact
size
base
on
our
own
font
manag
system
in
order
to
do
that
the
wchart
type
charact
string
must
be
decompos
to
charact
set
thi
mean
that
if
one
wchart
type
compound
string
with
ascii
and
kanji
mix
for
exampl
is
given
each
element
of
the
wchart
array
must
be
check
it
correspond
charact
set
base
on
a
bit
layout
and
applic
environ
local
in
thi
case
if
the
local
is
japanes
each
wchart
charact
will
be
classifi
either
to
iso
jisx
or
so
we
need
a
function
to
do
thi
the
function
must
check
how
mani
charact
from
the
top
are
the
same
charact
set
and
what
the
charact
set
is
we
could
not
find
ani
public
xr
function
to
do
that
and
inevit
use
xsi
intern
function
to
construct
that
function
the
follow
is
the
sourc
code
of
that
function
decomposecharacterset

to

code
we
had
use
mit
releas
version
of
xr
and
it
xsi
implement
until
hpup
and
ran
applic
success
one
of
the
reason
to
use
xsi
wa
that
becaus
hp
did
not
releas
hp
xr
until
the
o
and
we
had
no
way
to
know
how
hp
r
would
be
implement
we
had
hope
xsi
popular
and
use
it
intern
function
the
hp
linker
complain
that
there
are
no
xsi
intern
function
implement
we
observ
from
hp
libxa
they
use
some
ximp
implement
but
we
are
not
sure
if
they
use
mit
vanilla
ximp
version
or
their
own
version
of
ximp
and
therefor
find
just
counter
part
function
in
mit
ximp
for
xsi
doe
not
seem
to
lead
u
a
solut
my
question
and
goal
is
to
know
how
we
can
construct
a
function
like
decomposecharacterset
list
abov
is
there
ani
function
to
check
charact
set
of
each
element
of
wchart
type
string
depend
on
local
if
it
is
a
public
function
that
is
perfect
but
even
if
it
is
not
we
want
to
use
ani
intern
function
in
hp
xr
a
we
did
for
mit
r
in
order
to
render
a
wchart
type
string
there
must
be
some
machineri
to
judg
charact
set
and
that
is
how
the
proper
font
are
select
for
the
string
we
have
no
way
to
find
out
that
without
ani
hp
xr
sourc
file
we
want
to
know
how
we
can
use
that
for
our
goal
ani
help
or
comment
would
be
highli
appreci
i
also
appreci
if
anyon
tell
me
about
ximp
treat
around
thi
area
even
if
it
is
not
hp
implement
