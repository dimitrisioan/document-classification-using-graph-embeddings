that
are
an
instant
recip
for
mousiti
imho
system
is
undoubtedli
the
worst
gui
i
have
use
out
of
that
risco
mswombl
and
x
simpli
becaus
it
doe
not
provid
enough
keyboard
shortcut
window
i
must
confess
i
quit
like
cover
your
ear
becaus
you
can
actual
use
it
without
have
to
ever
touch
the
mous
stuff
delet
the
user
rather
than
make
thing
easier
and
there
should
alway
be
the
option
to
do
it
your
way
if
you
want
to
which
is
whi
i
like
the
unixx
combin
so
much

customiz
hear
hear
i
agre
complet
one
thing
i
cant
stand
about
the
mac
interfac
is
it
shear
determin
to
forc
you
to
use
the
mousewhat
if
your
mous
breaksyour
whole
system
is
down
i
like
the
mouseit
is
handi
on
some
occass
such
a
cut
and
past
and
move
icon
around
etc
but
for
most
work
the
keyboard
and
hot
key
are
time
faster
than
use
the
mous
sure
it
is
a
plu
to
be
abl
to
do
someth
simpl
if
you
are
an
inexperienc
user
but
how
long
is
it
befor
your
are
experienc
a
month
two
speak
of
pc
at
the
moment
i
dont
think
it
is
too
much
to
ask
that
window
programm
provid
not
onli
a
menumous
interfac
but
also
look
forward
to
those
who
would
like
to
move
on
to
hot
key
and
command
line
interfac
which
usual
allow
you
to
do
more
in
le
time
if
you
are
experienc
all
of
the
abov
equal
appli

on

especi
sinc
unix
is
at

more
