hi
im
new
to
thi
group
so
plea
bear
with
me
two
year
ago
i
wrote
a
sunview
applic
for
fast
anim
of
raster
file
with
sunview
becom
rapidli
obselet
ive
final
decid
to
rewrit
everyth
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
togeth
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimag
is
consider
slower
factor
of
on
averag
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
move
imag
data
from
memori
pixrect
to
a
canva
thi
wa
on
a
sparc
ipx
it
seem
that
the
x
protocol
commun
is
slow
thing
down
or
xputimag
is
inefficientor
both
use
xputimag
your
sourc
is
maintain
by
the
client
and
the
destin
is
maintain
by
the
server
thu
you
incur
the
overhead
of
transport
through
whatev
clientserv
commun
mechan
you
are
use
is
it
possibl
for
you
to
maintain
your
sourc
imag
in
pixmap
these
are
maintain
by
the
server
so
copi
them
into
a
window
is
much
cheaper
also
make
sure
you
are
not
send
ani
unnecessari
xsync
or
run
in
xsynchon
mode
