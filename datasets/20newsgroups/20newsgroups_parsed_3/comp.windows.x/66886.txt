andrew

write
my
impress
is
that
most
peopl
use
motif
becaus
their
o
vendor
suppli
it
with
x
suno
user
exclud
and
becaus
it
is
similar
in
look
and
feel
to
mswindow
and
o
pm
person
i
also
prefer
the
look
and
feel
of
motif
no
flame
pleas
just
an
opinion
see
a
motif
ha
been
adopt
by
sun
ibm
hp
cant
remeb
the
other
member
in
the
recent
announc
im
sure
youll
see
it
on
virtual
everi
workstat
ie
sun
ibm
hp
and
dec
must
make
up
the
vast
major
of
all
hardwar
i
am
also
concern
by
thi
preval
of
motif
particularli
from
the
point
of
view
of
write
and
obtain
free
softwar
a
the
linux
and
bsd
commun
grow
howev
i
think
that
motif
will
lose
some
of
it
grip
at
least
in
the
noncommerci
marketplac
port
of
motif
to
both
bsd
and
linux
are
avail
for
a
fee
of
about
thi
is
cost
recoveri
for
the
person
who
bought
the
right
to
redistribut
the
activ
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
group
pertain
to
motif
ha
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
thi
will
also
caus
a
diverg
between
commerci
and
noncommerci
softwar
ie
you
will
onli
get
free
softwar
use
athena
or
openlook
widget
set
and
onli
get
commerci
softwar
use
the
motif
widget
set
i
cant
see
whi
if
just
about
everi
workstat
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platform
i
cant
see
thi
caus
major
problem
side
note
all
the
x
base
code
i
am
write
and
will
distribut
freeli
when
complet
is
base
on
motif
becaus
from
a
programmat
and
also
look
and
feel
point
of
view
i
like
it
the
best
no
flame
on
thi
one
