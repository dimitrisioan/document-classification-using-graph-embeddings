would
fight
the

for

more
importantli
memori
if
you
put

you
give

a

sort

benefit
your

their

never
have

sort
through
all
of

it
also
ha
drawback
the

that
you

ha
to
load

everi

it
start
up
thi
doesnt
seem
to
make
that
much
of

and
you
might
consid
thi
a
huge
boon
to
usabl
if
you
are
modifi
an

resourc
databas
you
just
need
to
rerun
the

without
have
to

again
xrdb
will
by
default
run
your

through

when
your

are
split

then
load

they

the

is
enough
to
caus
some
peopl
to
dismiss
thi

you
may
also

break

neither
