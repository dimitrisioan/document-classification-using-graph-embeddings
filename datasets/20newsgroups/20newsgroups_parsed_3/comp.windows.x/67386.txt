desqviewx
on
a
pc
and
network
traffic
in
articl
technic
support
write
in
articl
write
what
sort
of
traffic
is
gener
with
the
xcall
i
am
curiou
to
find
out
the
requir
bandwidth
that
a
link
must
have
if
one
machin
run
dvx
is
support
multipl
user
client
and
we
requir
adequ
respons
time
anyon
have
ani
idea
i
expect
the
limit
factor
will
be
your
server
machin
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
exampl
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughli
peopl
use
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
box
novel
file
server
and
each
other
it
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
mayb
concentr
so
you
have
peopl
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badli
load
net
or
the
app
you
want
to
run
were
veri
network
intens
you
could
run
into
some
slowdown
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machin
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenti
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
peopl
run
program
off
it
your
go
to
see
some
slowdown
becaus
your
now
on
effect
a
mhz
of
cours
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
task
are
idl
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
work
program
run
youll
know
it
well
i
can
buy
a
bigger
and
more
power
server
machin
becaus
of
the
signific
drop
in
price
year
after
year
the
link
i
want
to
use
though
isdn
k
is
costli
and
the
bandwidth
limit
that
whi
my
interest
lie
in
see
if
such
a
link
can
be
use
and
see
what
traffic
go
through
it
have
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
program
be
run
by
ad
in
call
to
give
up
time
slice
when
idl
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probabl
run
peopl
on
a
given
machin
befor
you
start
see
slowdown
again
thi
time
from
network
bandwidth
hmmm
ha
anyon
at
your
centr
monitor
the
traffic
at
all
are
you
run
ani
standard
mswindow
program
like
word
what
sort
of
packet
go
blaze
through
what
size
link
do
you
have
mb
or
mb
what
is
the
averag
traffic
flow
go
through
your
network
or
do
you
have
few
high
peak
and
then
mani
low
point
it
all
realli
depend
on
what
the
program
are
do
ie
your
go
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
app
are
all
do
network
thing
also
what
do
you
mean
by
network
thing
i
vision
use
m
window
and
other
window
applic
over
the
network
were
the
process
are
run
on
the
server
and
all
i
am
get
are
the
display
i
am
wonder
how
good
is
the
x
and
subsequ
dvx
protocol
in
transfer
these
imag
with
xcall
and
display
them
