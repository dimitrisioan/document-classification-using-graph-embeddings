run

prior
to
use
xdm
i
use
to
set
path
and
other
environ
variabl
like
manpath
helppath
arch
etc
in
my
login
file
with
xdm
the
login
file
doesnt
get
execut
and
therefor
neither
the
olwm
rootwindow
nor
my
applic
know
about
these
variabl
one
usual
suggest
is
to
put
everyth
into
your
everytim
shell
rcfile
instead
of
your
loginonli
one
which
is
fair
enough
if
you
onli
have
a
few
user
who
know
what
theyr
do
if
you
have
sever
hundr
user
who
do
what
the
book
tell
them
though
then
it
confus
at
best
anoth
is
to
have
your
xterm
run
login
shell
but
that
still
leaf
the
window
manag
and
the
thing
that
get
start
from
it
menu
with
the
wrong
environ
our
altern
is
that
instead
of
have
xdm
run
the
client
startup
script
it
run
the
user
favourit
shell
a
a
login
shell
and
ha
it
then
run
the
rest
of
the
startup
script
that
way
the
user
usual
environ
get
set
up
a
normal
