readonli
colorcel
again
poset
for
a
friend
okay
i
got
such
great
respons
from
my
last
question
thank
everyon
let
tri
again
how
can
i
tell
if
a
colorcel
is
readonli
i
want
to
use
ani
readonli
cell
that
are
alreadi
in
my
colormap
onc
i
start
run
out
of
allocat
cell
use
some
arbitrari
nearest
color
match
scheme
to
get
those
cell
that
come
closest
to
a
request
color
onc
i
determin
if
a
cell
is
readonli
i
assum
i
can
then
just
request
an
xalloccolor
with
the
exact
same
color
specif
and
it
will
then
be
flag
a
use
by
my
applic
so
that
it
doesnt
later
get
freed
by
someon
els
and
alloc
again
a
readwrit
to
anoth
applic
so
far
the
onli
way
ive
figur
out
to
do
thi
is
to
write
my
own
error
handler
and
just
go
ahead
and
request
the
cell
color
onc
my
colormap
is
all
full
up
it
should
error
out
if
the
cell
is
nonshar
but
life
would
be
much
easier
if
i
could
just
detect
the
readonlyshar
stuff
directli
ani
