oh
boy
have
i
want
thi
too
howev
i
believ
that
the
cursor
will
be
under
the
server
control
could
be
wrong
on
an
xtermin
for
exampl
if
the
server
wa
not
the
one
control
the
cursor
then
tri
to
get
the
xterm
applic
to
do
the
blink
would
caus
needle
and
yucki
network
overhead
consistantli
most
peopl
who
write
cursor
blink
code
just
implement
the
simpl
case
a
straight
msec
or
so
onoff
cycl
howev
the
cursor
will
work
much
better
if
cursor
blink
is
suppress
ie
the
cursor
is
made
visibl
ani
time
the
cursor
move
and
for
to
sec
thereaft
if
you
dont
do
thi
the
cursor
will
be
hard
to
track
when
in
motion
you
allway
could
port
and
use
emu
from
exportlcsmiteducontribemutarz
weve
implement
a
blink
text
cursor
for
the
veri
reason
peopl
mention
you
can
even
configur
the
actual
size
of
the
text
cursor
horizont
ver
tical
line
cursor
smaller
block
cursor
turn
on
and
off
blink
set
the
blink
rate
and
so
on
you
even
get
blink
text
ok
enough
advertis
i
havent
look
at
the
xterm
code
in
thi
respect
but
from
the
memori
i
have
when
we
had
to
decid
whether
to
start
with
xterm
and
make
it
do
what
we
want
mostli
the
blink
text
id
say
it
wont
be
easi
sinc
xterm
is
a
hairi
mess
understand
if
you
follow
it
root
back
to
x
the
actual
task
to
get
the
cursor
to
blink
isnt
that
difficult
if
you
provid
the
right
hook
a
antonio
mention
youll
have
to
show
the
cursor
directli
after
it
ha
move
or
peopl
will
becom
confus
sinc
it
a
good
idea
to
take
the
cursor
off
the
screen
when
you
do
anyth
on
screen
anyway
thi
isnt
veri
complic
youll
just
have
to
start
the
blink
process
with
the
cursor
show
directli
after
it
map
a
for
the
portabl
of
emu
and
it
newest
version
the
one
on
export
is
still
the
same
a
on
the
r
contrib
tape
we
want
to
get
out
a
new
releas
for
over
six
month
now
but
unfortun
were
drown
in
work
but
sinc
the
chang
arent
affectiong

behavior
much
id
say
whoever
want
to
tri
emu
shouldnt
wait
for
a
new
version
a
is
emu
wont
work
on
bsd
deriv
system
eg
sun
with
anyth
el
than
a
csh
there
is
a
fix
to
thi
which
is
veri
short
