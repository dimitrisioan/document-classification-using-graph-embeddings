in
mind
neither

seem
to
creat
standard
colormap
of
cours
one
can
use
xstdcmap
to
creat
standard
colormap
howev
xstdcmap
doesnt
seem
to
tri
veri
hard
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
default
colormap
when
i
use
standard
colormap
creat
by
xstdcmap
the
rest
of
my
display
go
black
so
it
seem
a
if
use
of
standard
colormap
caus
the
veri
problem
standard
colormap
are
intend
to
avoid
perhap
if
everi
applic
use
standard
colormap
thing
would
be
wonder
but
not
mani
applic
seem
to
use
standard
colormap
final
the
oper
of
the
function
xmugetcolormapalloc
xmustandardcolormap
and
xmucreatecolormap
seem
inconsist
with
the
section
of
the
xr
xlib
document
accord
to
the
section
of
the
xr
xlib
document
p
for
grayscal
colormap
onli
the
colormap
redmax
redmult
and
basepixel
member
are
defin
the
other
member
are
ignor
to
comput
a
grayscal
pixel
valu
use
the
follow
express
gray

xffffffff
xmugetcolormapalloc
defin
in
mitlibxmucmapallocc
is
use
by
xmulookupstandardcolormap
defin
in
mitlibxmulookupcmapc
to
select
redmax
greenmax

bluemax
valu
for
the
call
to
xmustandardcolormap
when
the

ot
of

refer
