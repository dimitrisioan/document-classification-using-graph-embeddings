write
i
use
desqviewx
and
i
think
it
is
great
where
it
realli
shine
imho
is
to
let
unix
user
log
into
a
pc
and
run
do
and
window
applic
with
the
display
go
to
their
screen
youll
need

if
you
have

question
you
can
write
to
in
my
opinion
if
you
want
to
have
other
peopl
log
in
and
run
applic
at
your
pc
youll
want
to
have
a
with
meg
of
ram
also
the
xwindow
softwar
in
desqviewx
realli
seem
to
like
an

base
graphic
card
person
i
found
that
thing
ran
better
with
a
scsi
drive
in
the
pc
than
with
esdi
drive
but
that
is
my
experi
onli
what
sort
of
traffic
is
gener
with
the
xcall
i
am
curiou
to
find
out
the
requir
bandwidth
that
a
link
must
have
if
one
machin
run
dvx
is
support
multipl
user
client
and
we
requir
adequ
respons
time
anyon
have
ani
idea
i
expect
the
limit
factor
will
be
your
server
machin
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
exampl
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughli
peopl
use
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
box
novel
file
server
and
each
other
it
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
mayb
concentr
so
you
have
peopl
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badli
load
net
or
the
app
you
want
to
run
were
veri
network
intens
you
could
run
into
some
slowdown
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machin
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenti
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
peopl
run
program
off
it
your
go
to
see
some
slowdown
becaus
your
now
on
effect
a
mhz
of
cours
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
task
are
idl
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
work
program
run
youll
know
it
have
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
program
be
run
by
ad
in
call
to
give
up
time
slice
when
idl
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probabl
run
peopl
on
a
given
machin
befor
you
start
see
slowdown
again
thi
time
from
network
bandwidth
it
all
realli
depend
on
what
the
program
are
do
ie
your
go
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
app
are
all
