write
i
am
develop
an
x
xtxm
applic
that
will
includ
a
graphic
window
of
some
sort
with
move
symbol
among
other
thing
a
pure
x
applic
could
be
implement
with
motif
widget
one
of
which
would
be
an
xmdrawingarea
for
draw
with
xlib
but
i
would
like
to
take
advantag
of
the
graphic
librari
gl
avail
on
our
ibm
r
sgi
gl
i
believ
is
it
possibl
to
mix
x
and
gl
in
one
applic
program
can
i
use
gl
subroutin
in
an
xmdrawingarea
or
in
an
x
window
open
by
me
with
xopenwindow
there
is
a
widget
alreadi
defin
for
gl
it
is
the
glxmdraw
motif
or
glxdraw
athena
widget
it
is
similar
to
a
xmdrawingarea
except
that
it
allow
you
to
use
gl
call
to
render
into
the
window
look
at
glxlink
glxunlink
glxgetconfig
and
glxwinset
in
the
man
page
i
have
never
use
gl
befor
but
the
doc
on
gl
winopen
say
that
the
first
time
winopen
is
call
it
open
a
connect
to
the
server
also
most
of
the
gl
call
do
not
requir
a
display
or
gc
unlik
most
x
call
from
thi
initi
inform
it
appear
that
x
and
gl
can
not
be
mix
easili
is
thi
true
the
glxmdraw
widget
work
pretti
well
opengl
will
be
an
improv
doe
pex
graphig
have
the
same
function
of
gl
i
think
gl
is
a
littl
easier
to
use
and
a
littl
more
power
but
that
just
an
opinion
mileag
may
vari
larri
d
pyeatt
the
view
express
here
are
not

those
of
