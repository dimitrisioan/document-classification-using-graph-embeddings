joseph

write
most
graphic
system
i
have
seen
have
draw
routin
that
also
specifi
a
color
for
draw
like
drawpointxycolor
or
drawlinexyxycolor
or
fillrectanglexyxycolor
with
x
i
have
to
do
someth
like
xsetforegroundcurrentcolor
xdrawpointdwxi
whi
split
thi
into
two
function
whi
did
x
design
decid
to
not
associ
the
color
with
the
object
be
drawn
and
instead
associ
it
with
the
display
it
is
be
drawn
on
for
flexibl
anyway
what
you
say
is
not
realli
true
the
color
inform
is
associ
with
a
graphicscontext
not
with
a
display
and
the
gc
is
a
paramet
to
the
draw
routin
so
if
you
need
to
fast
switch
between
green
dot
line
and
blue
one
of
width
you
can
make
gc
for
those
case
and
then
simpli
do
xdrawlinedpywingcredxyxi
xdrawlinedpywingcbluexyxi
for
thi
effect
thi
is
eventu
more
complic
to
do
for
the
programm
but
also
much
more
effici
and
flexibl
you
would
not
includ
all
the
other
paramet
like
line
pattern
with
cap
and
joinstyl
drawmod
and
so
on
in
everi
draw
call
so
whi
do
it
for
color
btw
stay
away
from
xdrawpoint
if
you
dont
realli
need
it
to
draw
random
point
for
imag
transfer
there
are
imag
routin
