like
to
know
which
c
toolkit
to
bet
on
for
use
in
a
new
long
term
project
i
have
the
same
problem
i
have
look
at
motif
wwl
interview
gina
and
a
few
variat
on
the
abov
ive
also
done
a
cursori
examin

viewh
i
like
viewh
abstract
best
of
all
of
the
toolkit
i
mention
but
the
result
code
look
littl
like
motif
and
i
have
littl
confid
that
thi
softwar
will
catch
on
or
otherwis
result
in
signific
longev
for
my
code
gina
allow
you
to
write
code
which
look
a
great
deal
like
motif
and
also
make
interest
use
of
inherit
but
the
result
code
is
almost
too
motiflik
and
is
certainli
not
significantli
le
verbos
than
equival
c
code
interview
look
promis
but
i
havent
found
a
free
version
with
motif
support
and
im
not
confid
how
wide
interview
with
motif
support
will
be
adopt
and
what
if
ani
specif
motif
support
will
be
avail
over
time
the
other
librari
produc
code
which
is
le
motiflik
but
which
doe
not
make
suffici
use
of
the
featur
of
c
to
simplifi
my
code
task
at
thi
point
my
inclin
is
to
write
my
motif
manipul
routin
in
c
and
invok
those
routin
from
my
c
code
use
simpl
abstract
suit
to
my
specif
task
later
if
osf
or
some
credibl
standardsset
bodi
come
up
with
a
c
interfac
to
motif
i
will
chang
to
that
it
doe
me
no
goo
to
write
in
c
if
my
choic
of
interfac
leav
me
with
code
which
leav
me
tie
to
an
abstract
which
is
not
consist
with
the
industri
direct
it
better
to
take
a
standard
if
inferior
solut
for
now
than
to
go
with
a
slgihtli
superior
approach
which
will
leav
me
with
both
useless
code
and
useless
skill
a
few
year
from
now
viewsh
is
the
onli
librari
id
consid
right
now
but
in
our
environ
wed
end
up
spend
nearli
to
use
it
and
i
cant
justifi
it
when
it
like
to
caus
shortterm
product
decreas
a
we
learn
