by

usrlibxxdmxserv
from

to

i
determin
that
my

and
divid

howev
thi
ha
caus
my
applic

to
behav
strang
after
some
research
i
believ
thi
is
caus
by
my
applic
request
font
by
famili
weight
slant
and
pointsiz
i
believ
that
x
is
grab
the
first
font
on
the
path
with
these
characterist
and
display
it
sinc
i
have
onli
dpi
and
dpi
font
on
my
path
the
result
are
inaccur
i
do
have
some
speedo
font
but
not
for
the
famili
i
am
use
helvetica
i
think
thi
is
incorrect
the
font
should
alway
be
provid
in
the
resolut
of
the
display
thi
never
seem
to
happen
unless
you
explicitli
request
font
by
xre
and
yre
thi
is
true
of
both
the
scaleabl
and
bitmap
font
for
instanc
the
command
xfd
fn
bitstreamchart
will
invok
a
dpi
font
despit
the
fact
that
thi
is
a
speedo
font
the
command
xfd
fn
adobecouri
will
invok
a
dpi
font
or
a
dpi
font
depend
on
my
font
path
despit
the
fact
that
x
know
my
display
is
dpi
and
that
it
can
gener
an
dpi
font
for
me
unless
i
my
applic
specifi
a
resolut
x
appear
to
pick
a
stupid
default
is
thi
a
bug
is
it
a
featur
if
so
whi
is
there
anyth
i
can
do
to
get
around
thi
problem
peopl
have
suggest
that
i
lie
about
my
resolut
and
specifi
a
singl
font
path
or
not
both
thi
would
at
least
make
my
app
consist
but
i
like
be
abl
to
look
at
ruler
that
appear
in
my

and
say
yup
