david

write
i
am
also
concern
by
thi
preval
of
motif
particularli
from
the
point
of
view
of
write
and
obtain
free
softwar
a
the
linux
and
bsd
commun
grow
howev
i
think
that
motif
will
lose
some
of
it
grip
at
least
in
the
noncommerci
marketplac
port
of
motif
to
both
bsd
and
linux
are
avail
for
a
fee
of
about
thi
is
cost
recoveri
for
the
person
who
bought
the
right
to
redistribut
the
activ
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
group
pertain
to
motif
ha
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
thi
will
also
caus
a
diverg
between
commerci
and
noncommerci
softwar
ie
you
will
onli
get
free
softwar
use
athena
or
openlook
widget
set
and
onli
get
commerci
softwar
use
the
motif
widget
set
i
cant
see
whi
if
just
about
everi
workstat
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platform
i
cant
see
thi
caus
major
problem
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
activ
linux
and
bsd
commun
are
popul
by
enthusiast
who
would
object
to
pay
ani
money
for
softwar
otherwis
they
would
probabl
have
gone
for
a
commerci
unix
an
import
factor
in
the
linux
commun
is
that
sourc
code
is
alway
avail
thi
is
probabl
similar
in
the
bsd
commun
howev
im
not
realli
involv
there
mani
peopl
use
linux
like
to
stay
at
the
cut
bleed
edg
ie
when
kernel
patch
c
librari
or
compil
patch
come
out
peopl
like
to
rebuild
their
entir
system
the
prime
requir
for
all
linux
softwar
is
that
it
is
avail
under
a
gnu
style
public
licens
henc
linux
softwar
us
either
the
athena
widget
or
xview
individu
may
write
softwar
requir
motif
but
i
doubt
it
is
wide
