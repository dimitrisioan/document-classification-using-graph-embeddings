ideal
oper
system
wa
death
blow
to
unix
gday
window
nt
is
a
step
forward
but
not
by
much
i
guess
for
do
user
who
think
multitask
is
realli
neat
add
puke
here
and
are
overjoy
to
be
abl
to
use
more
than
k
of
memori
it
a
major
improv
for
window
user
it
more
like
an
upgrad
with
facil
most
unix
user
take
for
grant
most
of
window
user
onli
use
pc
for
text
process
or
run
rdparti
applic
anyway
so
the
oper
system
featur
are
not
even
a
real
issu
my
ideal
oper
system
binari
compat
across
all
plaform
it
should
recogn
binari
and
configur
on
the
fli
so
i
dont
have
to
have
binmac
bindo
bindec
binsun
binhp
etc
multicpu
so
i
can
use
the
cpu
on
my
pc
and
w
and
mac
and
transput
and
dsp
i
dont
know
a
singl
site
which
ha
gone
for
a
singl
vendor
i
am
not
go
to
tradein
mflop
per
h
transput
or
ultrafast
fft
on
dsp
chip
note
nt
run
on
symmetr
multicpu
system
builtin
portabl
guigraph
tool
you
can
call
drawbutton
or
drawlin
and
it
doe
the
same
thing
no
matter
what
platform
or
display
it
should
also
translat
graphic
command
onthefli
so
i
can
use
pc
graphic
sw
on
my
workstat
and
x
softwar
on
my
pc
i
think
gui
are
not
just
nice
to
have
but
essenti
configur
frontend
so
you
can
make
it
look
like
unix
or
do
or
nt
or
o
and
run
shell
script
or
commandbat
file
object
orient
so
i
can
program
easili
under
it
and
not
have
to
reinvent
the
wheel
if
the
network
is
not
up
to
scratch
or
my
applic
need
to
access
sourceobject
code
on
the
fli
in
other
word
it
should
have
some
ai
capabl
that
and
a
tight
clean
kernel
so
you
can
actual
understand
it
anyon
know
of
someth
like
