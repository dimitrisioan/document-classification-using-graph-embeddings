but
your
perform
will
suck
lemon
run
an
xserver
on
a
clone
from
experi
you
would
be
much
better
off
with
an
xtermin
if
thi
is
a
new
instal
the
perform
will
be
at
least
four
time
better
in
addit
it
would
be
much
easier
to
instal
and
use
on
top
of
that
they
will
cost
about
the
same
price
a
clone

etc
you
spend
a
whole
lot
of
i
can
get
tektronix

the

i
think
your
perform
will
depend
upon
the
x

im
run
linux
and
xfree
on
a
mhz
dx
with
mb
of
ram
mb
swap
and
it
run
just
fine
it
a
lot
better
than
some
of
the
crappi
old
xtermin
in
the
lab
at
school
anyway
you
could
probabl
outfit
a
sx
with
a
minim
linuxx
setup
for
and
be
better
off
than
with
an
xtermin
