slightli
forc
the
server
to
repaint
it
it
is
repaint
in
the
correct
color
it
doesnt
happen
for
xterm
window
but
ha
happen
for
graphic
window
and
with
some
motif
client
i
expect
what
is
go
on
here
is
that
your
colormap
is
full
and
when
the
new
applic
start
up
it
can
not
add
the
color
that
it
need
to
the
colormap
it
therefor
ha
to
pick
and
choos
from
the
exist
color
thi
make
it
look
ugli
until

get
prioriti
then
macx
chang
the

that
the
select
