a

be
possibl
util
some
extens
onli
either
mitshm
to
do
the
shade
in
an
imag
and
fast
updat
the
window
with
it
or
pexopengl
which
should
be
abl
to
shade
themselv
the
portabl
vanilla
x
way
would
be
to
shade

have
a
look
on

the
point
where
it
is
better
than
xwindowc
from

the
version
i
have
is
use
the
xq
code
instead
