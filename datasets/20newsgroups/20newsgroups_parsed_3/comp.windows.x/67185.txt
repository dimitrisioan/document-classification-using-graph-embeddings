i
consid
twmstyle
squeez
titl
indispens
in
a
window
manag
i
like
to
have
two
tall
xterm
window
visibl
at
the
same
time
with
no
overlap
and
sinc
two
window
arent
enough
i
have
other
xterm
window
underneath
them
with
exactli
the
same
posit
in
case
your
not
familiar
with
squeez
titl
here
a
crude
pictur
figur
titl
a
titl
b
titl
c
thi
is
the
window
b
hide
window
c
but
bodi
of
the
you
can
still
see
c
titl
window
window
a
which
is
squeez
right
figur
squeez
titl
allow
me
to
have
about
such
window
in
each
stack
with
easi
access
and
per
stack
is
usual
more
than
i
realli
need
sinc
i
also
insist
on
have
a
virtual
wm
the
onli
problem
is
that
the
titl
locat
is
static
that
is
it
is
configur
in
twmrc
and
in
order
to
chang
it
you
have
to
edit
that
file
and
restart
the
window
manag
do
so
is
cumbersom
and
timeconsum
therefor
i
have
implement
fsqueez
left
center
right
function
in
my
own
copi
of
vtwm
the
idea
be
that
with
one
click
of
a
button
you
can
chang
thi
titl
a
thi
is
the
bodi
of
the
window
window
a
to
thi
titl
a
thi
is
the
bodi
of
the
window
window
a
okay
so
far
so
good
now
how
the
heck
do
i
get
them
to
put
thi
into
the
next
offici
twm
and
the
next
tvtwm
and
the
next
vtwm
and
the
next
ctwm
and
the
next
xyztwm
that
i
never
heard
of
one
way
would
be
to
post
in
compwindowsx
a
descript
of
thi
enhanc
togeth
with
an
explan
of
whi
i
think
it
is
a
veri
good
thing
and
hope
that
someon
read
it
in
case
it
isnt
alreadi
clear
whi
i
think
it
a
veri
good
thing
look
back
up
at
figur
and
pictur
window
a
move
over
on
top
of
window
b
and
c
now
window
a
titl
hide
window
b
titl
but
when
you
hit
fsqueezecent
the
result
is
titl
b
titl
a
titl
c
thi
is
the
bodi
of
the
window
window
a
which
is
on
top
the
rest
of
thi
post
explain
how
to
implement
it
base
on
my
xr
copi
of
vtvwmshar
it
just
a
sketch
becaus
post
the
full
diff
would
be
too
long
the
key
to
thi
enhanc
is
to
add
the
follow

similarli
for

of

you
also
have
to

add

so
forth
to

in

to
use

add

you
could
