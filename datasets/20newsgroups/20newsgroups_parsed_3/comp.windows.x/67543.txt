re
desqviewx
over
tcpip
how
reliabl
how
is
it
implement
in
articl
ethan
solomita
write
three
q
is
it
reliabl
i
use
it
all
day
everi
day
maintain
our
ftp
site
and
answer
mail
via
and
i
can
honestli
say
that
in
the
last
few
month
ive
never
had
my
machin
go
down
due
to
ani
sort
of
tcpip
network
manag
instabl
of
cours
ive
crash
my
machin
quit
a
few
time
on
purpos
dure
beta
test
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
the
tcpip
portion
is
quit
stabl
howev
keep
in
mind
that
dvx
and
the
network
manag
are
onli
go
to
be
a
stabl
a
the
softwar
they
sit
on
top
of
so
if
your
underli
network
kernel
is
flakey
you
cant
expect
dvx
to
be
terribl
stabl
how
doe
it
send
the
inform
from
a
m
window
app
over
the
x
protocol
doe
it
just
draw
everyth
a
graphic
into
one
window
or
doe
it
use
multipl
window
and
essenti
work
more
cleverli
it
just
go
a
a
window
that
ha
graphic
drawn
into
it
to
vastli
oversimplifi
what
go
on
we
just
take
the
window
graphic
api
call
and
translat
them
directli
to
xprotocol
unfortun
window
wa
not
realli
written
to
be
networkawar
so
sometim
we
see
a
speed
penalti
when
an
app
doe
someth
stupid
like
send
a
big
white
bitmap
to
eras
someth
rather
than
just
draw
a
white
box
fortun
that
sort
of
thing
is
rare
if
i
want
to
run
m
word
for
exampl
remot
do
i
have
to
run
a
separ
copi
of
m
window
remot
and
then
start
m
word
from
that
or
can
m
word
be
start
remot
on
it
own
you
need
to
run
m
window
which
word
then
run
insid
you
could
run
multipl
window
program
within
the
one
winx
window
and
window
ha
way
to
automag
start
winapp
when
you
start
window
so
in
practic
it
not
realli
a
major
problem
i
have
my
system
set
up
so
that
i
can
run
winx
which
automat
start
word
fullscreen
for
window
so
i
never
see
ani
part
of
window
but
