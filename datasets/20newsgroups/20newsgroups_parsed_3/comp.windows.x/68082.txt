implement

from

of
our

in
an

if
you
are
interrest
look
into
the
june
issu
of
the
joop
sig
public
journal
of
object
orient
program
there
should
be
our
paper
about
commoninteract
but
be
awar
that
it
is
our
state
of
the
art
from
commoninteractii
is
still
undocu
and
is
includ
becaus
it
wa
use
to
implement
the
dialog
editor
it
current
support
onli
draw
primit
line
rectangl
circl
but
we
plan
to
extend
it
to
support
bitmap
and
some
control
also
known
problem
the
xm
draw
class
ha
no
redraw
strategi
alway
redraw
the
whole
window
even
after
minim
chang
like
select
an
object
thi
look
veri
ugli
on
slow
display
and
should
be
fix
about
thi
first
releas
xm
is
still
incomplet
and
ha
a
lot
of
bug
but
we
are
use
it
here
for
smaller
applic
which
are
run
without
problem
so
i
think
i
can
call
it
a
beta
releas
which
can
be
use
to
develop
applic
for
ani
noncrit
purpos
commoninteract
may
be
call
a

it
develop
will
be
continu
thi
year
becaus
we
plan
to
use
it
for
anoth
research
project
here
besid
incomplet
and
the
redraw
problem
it
seem
to
be
stabl
and
can
