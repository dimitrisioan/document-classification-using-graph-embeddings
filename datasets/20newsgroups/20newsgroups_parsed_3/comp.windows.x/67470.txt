my
question
is
thi
is
there

what
the
state

i
dont

way
except
to
see
what
modifi
are
on
in
th
keypress
event
of
cours
if
there
is
some
reason
whi
you
need
to
alway
know
the
state
of

even
if
your
window
dont
have
the
keyborad
focu
you
can
alway
ask
for
keypress
event
from
the
root
window
then
you
get
all
the
keypress
and
you
alway
know
what
have
been
press
an
even
more
point
question
is
there
an
easi
mean
of
make
an
x
keyboard
act
like
a
pc
keyboard
ie
capslock
is
activ
and
the
user
press
shifta
id
like
to
get
a
lowercas
a
instead
of
a
i
think
thi
is
just
a
question
of
how
to
implement
xlookupstr
you
can
alway
write
anoth
function
that
interpret
the
keypress
a
you
like
you
can
look
at
the
implement
of
xlookupstr
from
the
xlib
sourc
and
then
modifi
it
a
littl
bit
