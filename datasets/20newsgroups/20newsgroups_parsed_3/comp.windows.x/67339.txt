write
im
write
an
x
server
for
some
videogener
equip
the
hardwar
is
truecolor
in
yuv
space
in
x
term
it
ha
a
bit
static
color
visual
i
would
realli
like
to
have
the
server
just
present
thi
static
visual
but
im
not
sure
if
thi
will
be
accept
to
most
x
client
the
three
problem
i
see
are
the
colormap
though
huge
is
static
all
pixel
would
be
byte
wide
becaus
the
hardwar
actual
life
in
yuv
space
the
translat
rgbyuv
will
introduc
some
round
error
we
tri
to
ship
an
x
server
onc
that
onli
support
a
bit
truecolor
visual
the
main
problem
we
encount
were
client
written
with
logic
like
the
follow
if
defaultdepth
assum
default
depth
is
bit
these
client
need
an
bit
deep
visual
in
the
root
window
to
run
correctli
other
client
didnt
even
bother
to
do
that
much
and
just
outright
assum
they
had
a
dynam
visual
class
with
a
dynam
colormap
xstorecolor
doesnt
work
on
cmap
associ
with
static
or
truecolor
visual
class
but
mani
client
dont
bother
to
check
they
just
start
throw
xstorecolor
call
at
you
though
both
are
clearli
client
error
thi
is
the
case
with
so
mani
client
that
it
easier
for
you
to
expos
bit
pseudocolor
a
a
default
root
window
visual
than
it
ever
would
be
for
all
these
client
writer
to
chang
their
client
to
do
the
right
thing
