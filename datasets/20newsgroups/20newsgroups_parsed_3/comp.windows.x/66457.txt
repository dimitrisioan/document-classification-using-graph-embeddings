for
thing
like
access
to

i
know
command
line
and
love
i
think
youll
find
that
experi
sic
user
command
line
der
mous
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
felt
the
same
way
the
i
start
use
gooyi
give
me
the
command
line
when
someth
out
of
the
ordinari
need
done
and
the
gooy
when
i
am
do
normal
or
rep
work
note
that
most
oper
are
repet
hacker
love
cl
becaus
what
i
like
about
gui
the
abil
to
view
and
manipul
a
group
of
object
file
text
directori
etc
and
and
manipul
them
in
some
way
such
a
delet
copi
past
renam
the
abil
to
have
sever
applic
screen
visibl
and
access
at
the
same
time
be
abl
to
do
a
standard
set
of
function
easili
and
quickli
on
an
unfamiliar
oper
system
i
am
familiar
with
the
command
line
of
sever
oper
system
but
occasion
i
will
have
to
some
work
on
a
system
that
i
almost
never
use
if
it
ha
a
gui
i
can
usual
accomplish
what
i
want
to
do
fairli
easili
the
command
line
on
the
other
hand
often
is
a
long
and
pain
experi
what
i
hate
about
gui
have
to
switch
between
the
mous
and
the
keyboard
i
guess
i
have
a
strong
onehand
prefer
i
like
to
use
a
comput
with
one
hand
and
use
the
other
for
hold
someth
like
a
piec
of
paper
of
a
mug
of
tea
i
have
configur
my
favorit
editor
so
that
most
of
the
edit
function
can
be
done
with
one
hand
such
a
navig
cut
past
search
open
and
save
file
etc
the
main
thing
i
need
to
use
both
hand
for
is
enter
text
i
guess
i
need
to
get
one
of
those
mous
with
like
button
or
someth
and
then
i
will
have
the
best
of
both
world
brent
