paint
with
increas
resolut
some
peopl
work
a
few
cube
over
have
come
up
with
thi
need
and
it
seem
that
someon
out
there
just
might
have
done
it
alreadi
and
can
point
me
to
some
tool
that
would
help
what
theyd
like
to
do
is
given
a
window
that
is
take
a
long
time
to
draw
becaus
either
the
data
is
arriv
over
a
slow
link
or
the
display
is
across
a
slow
link
they
would
like
to
first
paint
a
lowresolut
version
of
the
pictur
and
then
repaint
it
in
higher
resolut
thu
the
pictur
might
first
be
gener
in
resolut
with
each
x
squar
of
pixel
be
fill
in
with
a
singl
color
next
each
x
squar
would
be
replac
by
x
squar
final
the
x
version
would
be
paint
sinc
one
of
the
scenario
is
with
the
window
be
on
the
other
side
of
a
slow
link
the
lowr
version
obvious
wouldnt
be
transmit
a
a
bitmap
that
wouldnt
help
at
all
instead
there
would
have
to
be
a
process
on
the
far
end
that
receiv
the
lowr
pictur
a
a
small
bitmap
and
blow
up
each
pixel
into
a
squar
sorta
like
the
magnifi
program
do
thi
bring
up
the
question
of
whether
the
x
server
can
help
that
is
when
a
window
is
open
is
there
a
way
to
ask
that
a
filter
program
be
run
to
process
the
pixel
or
is
the
onli
way
to
use
someth
like
rsh
to
start
up
a
remot
process
permiss
deni
and
have
it
open
a
local
window
it
seem
the
most
like
scenario
is
a
librari
routin
that
start
up
such
a
program
remot
and
then
accept
bitmap
compress
each
one
by
some
amount
and
send
them
to
the
remot
program
to
expand
but
if
there
is
someth
that
x
itself
can
do
to
help
it
be
nice
to
hear
about
it
i
look
in
sever
fm
but
if
it
there
i
obvious
dont
know
the
keyword
if
someon
ha
a
nifti
tool
avail
that
packag
it
all
we
might
want
to
get
a
copi
oh
ye
thi
is
to
run
on
some
sun
part
of
the
idea
is
to
build
demo
that
can
show
such
thing
a
if
thi
were
run
across
say
a
bp
link
thi
is
how
fast
the
pictur
would
appear
then
the
custom
would
get
a
feel
for
the
speed
that
they
need
to
pay
for
if
the
auto
industri
were
like
the
comput
industri
a
car
would
now
cost
would
get
mile
to
the
gallon
and
at
random
time
would
explod
kill
all
it
passeng
