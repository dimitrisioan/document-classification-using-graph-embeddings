nd
post
of
the
question
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
get
answer
suppos
you
have
an
idl
app
with
a
realiz
and
map
window
that
contain
xlib
graphic
a
button
widget
when
press
will
caus
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
thi
action
clearli
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directli
instead
it
should
regist
the
exist
of
the
new
item
in
a
memori
structur
and
let
the
same
expos
event
handler
that
handl
regular
expos
event
eg
window
managerdriven
exposur
take
care
of
render
the
new
imag
use
an
expos
event
handler
is
a
proper
way
to
do
thi
becaus
at
the
time
the
handler
is
call
the
xlib
window
is
guarante
to
be
map
the
problem
of
cours
is
that
no
expos
event
is
gener
if
the
window
is
alreadi
visibl
and
map
what
we
need
to
do
is
somehow
tickl
the
window
so
that
the
expos
handler
is
hit
with
argument
that
will
enabl
it
to
render
just
the
part
of
the
window
that
contain
the
new
item
what
is
the
best
way
to
tickl
a
window

produc
thi
behavior
