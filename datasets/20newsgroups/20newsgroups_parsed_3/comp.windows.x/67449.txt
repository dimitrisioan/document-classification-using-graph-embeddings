all

receiv
thi

is
caus
by
a
bad
interact
between

a
misfeatur
of
the
x
protocol
and
a
bug
in
the
xt
intrins
the
intrins
bug
is
that
it
ignor
the
xy
posit
given
in
reparentnotifi
event
olwm
is
structur
in
such
a
way
that
when
a
window
is
pop
down
the
last
event
the
client
receiv
is
a
reparentnotifi
event
at
thi
point
the
intrins
notion
of
the
shell
locat
is
out
of

if
a

use
the

it
issu
a

howev
a
misfeatur
of

is
that
a

actual
thing
are
somewhat
more
complex
becaus
the

the
solut
is
for
