do

mean
anyth
kevin
davidson
write
in
my
opinion
a
program
degre
is
still
worth
have
ye
but
a
c
degre
is
not
a
program
degre
doe
anybodi
know
of
a
comput
cours
where
program
is
taught
comput
scienc
is
a
branch
of
math
or
the
cours
i
did
wa
ive
also
done
a
softwar
engin
cours
much
more
practic
and
like
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
an
employ
realli
want
rather
than
what
they
think
they
want
but
also
did
not
teach
program
the
abil
to
program
wa
an
entri
requir
tri
the
msc
comput
scienc
cours
at
the
real
newcastl
univers
it
a
convers
cours
but
at
least
they
teach
real
program
in
the
space
of
month
we
were
taught
pascal
simula
prolog
miranda
also
some
basic
low
level
stuff
wa
cover
a
well
they
also
did
concurr
program
and
oper
system
some
softwar
engin
plu
quit
a
few
option
unit
includ
databas
theori
and
some
stuff
about
comm
the
pascal
is
to
be
replac
by
cc
i
think
next
year
i
learnt
thi
and
x
window
program
a
well
anyway
via
a
good
select
of
project
over
the
final
three
month
depend
on
your
tast
the
select
of
skill
learnt
can
be
quit
wide
reach
the
one
critisc
i
would
level
at
the
cours
which
i
would
have
thought
invalu
is
the
lack
of
an
option
to
do
the
project
period
in
industri
thi
would
probabl
need
a
slightli
longer
project
period
say
six
month
but
would
enhanc
the
prestig
and
use
of
an
alreadi
excel
and
thorough
cours
ye
i
know
thi
sound
like
a
plug
for
the
cours
