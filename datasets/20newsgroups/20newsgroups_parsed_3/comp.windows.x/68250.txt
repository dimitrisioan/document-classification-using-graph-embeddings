is
the

but
the
definit
of
broken
is
rel
pageview
requir
dsc
compliant
postscript
file
in
order
to
stop
at
page
break
i
dont
consid
that
broken
i
say
that
ani
program
that
put
out
a
postscript
file
that
isnt
dsc
compliant
is
broken
well
that
may
be
true
howev
the
man
page
for
pageview
for
ow
doe
not
mention
about
dsc
complianc
in
ani
event
the
point
here
is
that
if
you
tri
to
display
some
p
file
use
pageview
you
will
find
out
that
it
not
a
practic
tool
it
is
true
that
the
man
page
for
pageview
doe
not
say
that
the
file
need
to
be
dsc
compliant
that
is
the
fault
of
the
left
hand
not
know
what
the
right
hand
is
do
at
sun
i
wa
inform
by
a
sun
employe
that
the
pageview
program
doe
requir
dsc
compliant
postscript
there
wa
the
possibl
that
it
wa
go
to
be
chang
so
that
if
the
file
wasnt
dsc
compliant
that
it
would
stop
at
each
showpag
i
believ
that
thi
method
would
preclud
be
abl
to
go
backward
and
forward
through
the
file
ie
you
could
onli
go
forward
to
the
next
showpag
thi
isnt
in
ow
pageview
but
mayb
it
is
in
the
solari
x
version
of
ow
ow
in
ani
event
i
find
pageview
extrem
use
sinc
all
of
the
postscript
that
i
produc
is
dsc
compliant
i
dont
have
ani
problem
