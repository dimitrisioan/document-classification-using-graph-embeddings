re
help
need
callback
action
and
event
i
understood
that
there
are
two
method
to
connect
applic
code
to
widget
callback
and
action
the
problem
i
face
now
is
that
i
have
a
quit
long
piec
of
applic
code
that
perform
a
lot
of
draw
into
a
window
i
want
to
connect
thi
to
a
widget
no
problem
so
far
i
could
use
a
callback
function
or
an
action
to
do
thi
process
ani
event
afterward
but
becaus
the
draw
take
some
while
i
want
the
applic
code
sequenc
to
be
abl
to
be
interrupt
by
event
then
i
want
to
handl
the
event
and
resum
with
process
the
applic
code
at
the
point
it
wa
interrupt
it
seem
to
me
that
thi
isnt
possibl
but
how
can
i
give
the
user
the
impress
that
hi
input
are
immedi
process
use
a
workproc
see
xtappaddworkprocxt
you
should
split
your
draw
routni
up
into
small
chunk
thi
is
the
hard
part
then
in
the
callback
that
start
the
draw
you
call
xtappaddworkproc
to
call
your
workproc
the
first
time
your
workproc
should
be
a
function
that
return
a
boolean
true
when
you
are
finish
and
fals
when
you
want
to
keep
process
if
you
return
fals
the
workproc
is
automat
reinstal
note
that
thi
method
is
better
that
use
a
timeout
loop
sinc
event
get
process
in
a
more
precedenceori
manner
if
you
are
use
the
same
ada
bind
i
am
howev
you
are
hose
and
should
look
into
