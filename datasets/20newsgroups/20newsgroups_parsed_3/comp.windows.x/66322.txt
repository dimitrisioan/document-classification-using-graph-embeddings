in
brief
xlib
xt
and
most

have
no

exclus
for

section
ani
interrupt
handler
is
like
to
leav
one
of
the
abov
librari
in
an
inconsist
state
such
a
all
the
appropri
flag
not
yet
set
dangl
pointer
in
the
middl
of
a
list
travers
etc
note
that
the
ansi
c
standard
point
out
that
behavior
of
a
signal
handler
is
undefin
if
the
signal
handler
call
ani
function
other
than
signal
itself
so
thi
is
not
a
problem
specif
to
xlib
and
xt
the
posix
specif
mention
other
function
which
may
be
call
safe
but
it
may
not
be
assum
that
these
function
are
call
by
xlib
or
xt
function
the
onli
safe
way
to
deal
with
signal
is
to
set
a
flag
in
the
interrupt
handler
thi
flag
later
need
to
be
check
either
by
a
work
procedur
or
a
timeout
callback
it
is
incorrect
to
add
either
of
these
in
the
interrupt
handler
a
anoth
note
it
is
danger
to
add
a
work
procedur
that
never
finish
thi
effect
preempt
ani
work
procedur
previous
ad
and
so
they
will
never
be
call
anoth
option
is
to
open
a
pipe
tell
the
event
loop
about
the
read
end
use
xtappaddinput
and
then
the
signal
handler
can
write
a
byte
to
the
write
end
of
the
pipe
for
each
signal
howev
thi
could
deadlock
your
process
if
the
pipe
fill
up
whi
dont
the
intrins
deal
with
thi
problem
primarili
becaus
it
is
suppos
to
be
a
portabl
layer
to
ani
hardwar
and
oper
system
is
that
a
good
enough
reason
i
dont
think
so
note
the
articl
in
the
x
journal
and
the
exampl
in
oreilli
volum
are
in
error
how
do
i
use
a
differ
visual
than
the
default
thi
requir
a
more
complic
answer
than
it
should
a
window
ha
three
thing
that
are
visual
specif
the
visual
colormap
and
border
pixmap
all
widget
have
their
own
colormap
and
borderpixmap
resourc
onli
shell
widget
have
visual
resourc
anoth
question
deal
with
whi
shell
have
a
visual
the
default
valu
of
these
resourc
is
copyfrompar
which
doe
exactli
what
it
say
in
the
shell
widget
copyfrompar
get
evalul
a
defaultvisualofscreen
and
defaultcolormapofscreen
when
ani
one
of
the
three
resourc
is
not
properli
set
a
badmatch
error
occur
when
the
window
is
creat
they
are
not
properli
set
becaus
each
of
the
valu
depend
on
the
visual
be
use
how
to
get
thi
to
work
there
are
two
part
to
the
answer
the
first
is
if
you
want
an
applic
to
start
with
a
particular
visual
and
the
second
is
if
you
want
a
particular
shell
within
an
applic
to
start
with
a
differ
visual
the
second
is
actual
easier
becaus
the
basic
inform
you
need
is
avail
the
first
is
a
littl
harder
becaus
youll
need
to
initi
much
of
the
toolkit
yourself
in
order
to
determin
the
need
inform
some
sampl
code
to
start

is
there
is
no

for

if

thi
then

fall

and
obtain

a

if
it
doe
it
must
have
it
own

method
to

when

you
should
also
make

is

the

the

it

how
to
get
around
thi
on
a
unix

the
best
approach
is
to
use
anoth
process
to
check
for

input
on

use
a

to
connect
the

it

thi
is
one
where
it
would
work
for

then
stop

woke
it

thi
seem
to
be
the

of
a

condit
in

ibm
claim

have
a

for

doesnt
work
at

ultrix
and
possibl
other
where

are
implement

wasnt
complet
broken
but
although
the
write
side
wrote
in

the

side
receiv
it
all
broken
up
a
if
it
wa
be
put

at

you
can
wast
a

by

get

it
by
detect
the

have

it

note
that
all

use

thi
is
an

occur
the

if

the

thi

all

the
