technic
support
write
in
articl
write
what
sort
of
traffic
is
gener
with
the
xcall
i
am
curiou
to
find
out
the
requir
bandwidth
that
a
link
must
have
if
one
machin
run
dvx
is
support
multipl
user
client
and
we
requir
adequ
respons
time
anyon
have
ani
idea
i
expect
the
limit
factor
will
be
your
server
machin
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
exampl
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughli
peopl
use
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
box
novel
file
server
and
each
other
it
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
mayb
concentr
so
you
have
peopl
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badli
load
net
or
the
app
you
want
to
run
were
veri
network
intens
you
could
run
into
some
slowdown
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machin
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenti
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
peopl
run
program
off
it
your
go
to
see
some
slowdown
becaus
your
now
on
effect
a
mhz
of
cours
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
task
are
idl
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
work
program
run
youll
know
it
well
i
can
buy
a
bigger
and
more
power
server
machin
becaus
of
the
signific
drop
in
price
year
after
year
the
link
i
want
to
use
though
isdn
k
is
costli
and
the
bandwidth
limit
that
whi
my
interest
lie
in
see
if
such
a
link
can
be
use
and
see
what
traffic
goe
through
it
sinc
i
dont
think
tom
alway
get
time
to
read
thi
group
ill
take
the
liberti
of
respond
to
some
of
thi
if
you
realli
want
tom
to
repli
you
should
send
mail
to
a
k
line
is
certainli
go
to
restrict
you
far
more
than
the
mbp
ethernet
that
we
typic
run
how
restrict
it
will
be
depend
on
what
you
run
and
how
you
run
it
i
would
think
that
a
coupl
of
instanc
of
some
realli
nasti
program
like
smoke
clover
would
make
the
link
useless
for
anyon
el
on
the
other
hand
probabl
xclock
quietli
updat
everi
second
or
so
wouldnt
impact
it
too
much
in
the
real
world
you
will
be
somewher
in
between
these
two
extrem
go
by
the
way
i
person
use
x
on
a
daili
basi
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
to
share
that
k
link
with
more
than
other
peopl
have
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
program
be
run
by
ad
in
call
to
give
up
time
slice
when
idl
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probabl
run
peopl
on
a
given
machin
befor
you
start
see
slowdown
again
thi
time
from
network
bandwidth
hmmm
ha
anyon
at
your
centr
monitor
the
traffic
at
all
are
you
run
ani
standard
mswindow
program
like
word
what
sort
of
packet
go
blaze
through
what
size
link
do
you
have
mb
or
mb
what
is
the
averag
traffic
flow
go
through
your
network
or
do
you
have
few
high
peak
and
then
mani
low
point
our
corpor
wan
is
a
uniqu
a
ani
other
the
usag
pattern
are
not
veri
good
predictor
of
how
your
will
behav
the
onli
one
of
our
low
bandwidth
link
that
normal
get
use
in
thi
way
is
a
k
link
to
ireland
that
they
often
use
to
run
a
do
text
base
client
end
of
a

databas
remot
from
the
dvx
machin
behind
me
sinc
the
server
end
is
or
wa
alway
at
thi
end
california
it
is
faster
to
remot
run
the
client
via
desqview
x
and
have
a
short
hop
to
the
server
than
run
the
client
local
and
have
a
long

to

a

let
break

the

a

restor
the

may
be

may
not
be
doe
the

that
it
display
on
have

if
so
and
the

had

the

can
be

will
gener

if
no

then
what
wa
be
cover

if

rectangl

we
can
tell
your

to
draw
that
quit
easili
if
it
wa
a
full

backdrop
of
ren
stimpi
we
may
have
to
send
it
back
to
the

server
bit

dvx
will
do
it
level
best
to
onli
redraw
that
small

but
in
some
unusu
case
the
entir
screen
may
need
to
be
repaint
assun
a
x

with
bit
per

that
bit
that
ha
to
be
sent
worst
possibl
case
your
look
at
about
second
in
realiti
it
would
never
be
thi
bad
sinc
the
screen
will
alway
have
part
that
will
be
tranlat
into
higher
level
x
call
it
all
realli
depend
on
what
the
program
are
do
ie
your
go
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
app
are
all
do
network
thing
also
what
do
you
mean
by
network
thing
i
vision
use
m
window
and
other
window
applic
over
the
network
were
the
process
are
run
on
the
server
and
all
i
am
get
are
the
display
i
am
wonder
how
good
is
the
x
and
subsequ
dvx
protocol
in
transfer
these
imag
with
xcall
and
display
them
on
a
client
machin
x
wa
design
from
the
ground
up
to
be
effici
across
a
network
it
pretti
good
for
thi
x
program
are
best
do
text
program
are
almost
a
good
sinc
we
conert
them
to
x
easili
someth
like
winx
is
a
hybrid
we
intercept
the
call
window
make
to
it
graphic
driver
mous
driver
keyboard
driver
and
convert
them
to
x
the
call
window
is
make
are
in
no
way
design
to
be
effici
on
a
packet
switch
network
we
go
to
a
lot
of
troubl
to
convert
them
to
the
high
level
xlib
call
we
can
but
we
are
somewhat
limit
becaus
we
