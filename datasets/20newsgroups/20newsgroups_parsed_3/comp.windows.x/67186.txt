also
mention
by
nick
kisseberth
look
interest
but
i
need
someon
to
point
me
to
some
document
is
thi
method
like
to
give
better
result
than
server
resid
pixmap
id
also
be
interest
in
look
at
the
xview
code
mention
abov
there
is
no
easi
answer
to
thi
question
it
depend
on
whether
the
display
devic
can
hold
pixmap
in
offscreen
memori
and
if
so
how
effici
the
server
manag
these
resourc
have
to
deal
with
limit
offscreen
memori
is
the
bane
of
the
server
implementor
exist
i
have
work
with
graphic
devic
where
the
offscreen
memori
to
main
display
copi
rate
eclips
that
of
the
main
memori
to
display
copi
rate
and
with
those
where
the
main
memori
to
display
is
faster
than
offscreen
to
display
requir
onli
a
write
to
the
framebuff
rather
than
a
read
of
the
fb
follow
by
a
write
if
your
server
use
the
cfb
code
or
someth
like
it
to
render
into
pixmap
in
cpu
main
memori
the
rate
you
can
get
through
mitshm
are
like
to
be
equal
mayb
a
tad
slower
depend
on
your
os
implement
of
share
memori
to
copyarea
from
pixmap
to
window
which
is
also
then
just
a
copi
from
cpu
main
memori
to
graphic
devic
one
advanag
of
mitshm
is
that
if
your
imag
are
larg
you
dont
end
up
grow
the
size
of
the
server
process
to
hold
them
one
disadvantag
of
the
mitshm
is
that
in
it
sampl
implement
there
is
no
provis
for
elegantli
clean
up
the
share
memori
segment
if
the
client
die
a
sudden
violent
death
eg
kill
you
have
to
be
mind
of
clutter
up
the
system
with
zombi
