backx
write
ye
that
is
a
bug
in
the
xr
port
of
xterm
you
sometim
get
thi
when
you
start
from
xdm
i
have
report
thi
to
casper
but
dont
know
whether
it
made
it
into
hi
set
of
patch
yet
basic
in
mitclientsxtermmainc
there
is
a
test
at
line
which
check
errno
after
attempt
to
open
devtti
add
the
errno
einval
case
to
it
and
you
should
be
fine
it
actual
a
bug
in
the
solari
kernel
we
could
add
a
workaround
to
xterm
open
should
never
return
einval
but
it
doe
i
didnt
have
time
to
updat
the
rsuno
patch
late
but
non
of
the
exist
problem
seem
to
warrant
a
new
set
of
patch
sinc
xsession
is
a
bourn
shell
script
anyway
you
might
a
well
add
a
line
etctimezon
a
it
is
done
in
etcprofil
xdm
coulda
also
keep
the
xdm
environ
variabl
it
should
have
inherit
it
from
the
environ
casper
