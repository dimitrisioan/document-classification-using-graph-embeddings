mhz
dx
system
and
am
consid
get
a
fan
for
the
cpu
the
processor
when
run
is
too
hot
to
touch
so
i
think
thi
is
a
fairli
good
idea
long
ago
when
i
did
some
electron
train
i
read
somewher
that
the
region
within
a
chip
that
defin
junctionsg
etc
slowli
diffus
over
time
and
thi
increas
with
temperatur
henc
a
hot
chip
go
offspec
sooner
ha
anyon
out
there
got
a
cpu
fan
ye
is
there
more
than
type
ye
seen
glueon
tapeon
clipon
oneinch
squar
and
larger
my
favorit
is
the
inch
plastic
ustoyo
fan
i
use
just
plop
down
on
top
of
the
chip
dure
opencas
servic
do
you
have
to
remov
the
cpu
from
it
scoket
to
instal
the
fan
depend
on
the
mount
do
all
cpu
fan
deriv
their
power
from
spare
drive
power
line
onli
if
the
manufactur
wa
smart
anyon
had
ani
troubl
with
cpu
fan
onli
if
it
go
out
got
that
blanket
effect
which
doesnt
help
chip
life
doe
anyon
have
ani
evid
that
cpu
fan
are
a
complet
wast
of
money
longer
system
life
make
good
econom
sens
to
me
how
are
these
fan
attach
glue
clip
melt
chees
ye
well
not
the
melt
chees
roughli
how
much
cooler
will
the
cpu
be
with
a
fan
a
oppos
to
without
let
you
touch
the
surfac
the
rule
of
thumb
for
cool
solidst
an
advert
ive
read
claim
f
v
f
ani
info
appreci
the
attach
fan
look
slick
and
work
well
but
im
bother
by
the
potenti
loss
of
cool
if
the
fan
go
out
at
least
with
the
power
suppli
fan
you
can
reach
back
there
everi
few
day
and
feel
the
fan
blow
i
prefer
to
put
a
stock
fan
off
the
drive
bracket
or
front
panel
to
blow
air
across
the
cpu
depend
a
lot
on
case
and
board
layout
though
onchip
fan
from
fri
electron
in
the
sf
bay
area
are
about
i
get
the
stock
power
suppli
fan
for
about
