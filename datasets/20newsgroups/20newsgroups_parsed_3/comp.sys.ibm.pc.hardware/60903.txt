i
must
say
that
i
have
been
a
custom
of
midwest
micro
for
over
year
now
and
have
been
well
taken
care
of
on
each
purchas
i
have
had
mani
friend
that
have
bought
that
same
modem
and
they
do
have
some
experi
with
set
up
modem
so
there
have
been
no
problem
in
of
them
that
i
know
of
the
fact
that
your
time
to
valuabl
for
you
to
spend
on
the
modem
is
where
you
went
wrong
whi
you
say
becaus
i
must
tell
you
of
the
ye
i
say
ppi
modem
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
that
i
wa
tri
to
use

my
bb
they
all
were
junk

i
want
