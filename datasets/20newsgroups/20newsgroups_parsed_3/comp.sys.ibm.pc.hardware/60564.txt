they
sit

they

even

i
swear
that
what
happen
here
are
some
relev

from
the
manual
data
is
transfer

at
a

my

on

singl

error
of
up

within

can

onthefli
in

a
they

allow
a

integr

no

to
the

perform
i
take
thi

error
correct
isnt
the
bottleneck
for
pagemod
oper
the
datatransf
rate
to
and
from
the
buffer
ram
is
up
to
mb
thi
high
transfer
rate
allow
the
at
interfac
ic
to
commun
over
the
at
bu
at
a
datatransf
rate
of
mb
while
the
dc
simultan
control
disktoram
transfer
so
the
thing
can
even
do
it
cach
prefetch
while
it
send
the

sector
it
ha
kb
read
buffer
for

i
guess
you
could
call
that
a
cach
so
when
i
do
a
sequenti
read
on
the
outer

whi

i
get
a
