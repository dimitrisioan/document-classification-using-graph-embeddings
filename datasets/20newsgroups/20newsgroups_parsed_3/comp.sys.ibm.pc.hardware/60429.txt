smith
write
but
i
still
want
to
know
whi
it
intrins
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bu
when
it
come
to
multitask
os
when
manag
data
from
a
singl
scsi
hard
drive
a
scsi
control
that
transfer
data
by
dma
allow
the
cpu
to
request
data
from
the
hard
drive
and
continu
work
while
the
control
get
the
data
and
move
it
to
memori
ide
also
us
dma
techniqu
i
believ
floppi
control
also
us
dma
and
most
ad
board
also
use
dma
dma
is
no
big
deal
and
ha
noth
to
do
directli
with
scsi
ide
doe
not
do
dma
thi
is
becaus
it
like
te
pc
at
hard
disk
interfac
the
control
move
a
sector
to
some
buffer
memori
on
the
control
card
then
the
cpu
move
the
data
from
the
buffer
to
main
memori
where
it
need
if
ide
doesnt
work
thi
way
then
it
not
compat
heck
if
ide
use
dma
then
youd
hear
all
kind
of
complaint
about
isa
bu
system
with
more
than
m
ram
not
work
with
their
ide
drive
m
is
the
dma
address
limit
of
the
isa
bu
and
if
ide
did
dma
there
would
be
troubl
btw
there
are
dmaenabl
signal
in
the
ide
cabl
spec
but
the
last
report
i
heard
wa
that
they
are
never
implement
becaus
it
would
requir
a
differ
kind
of
ide
adapt
and
differ
driver
richard
krehbiel
o
will
do
for
me
until
amigado
for
the
come
along
