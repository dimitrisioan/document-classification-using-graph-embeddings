they
too
said
that
the

wa
the
best
monitor
to
get
if
you
had
the
money
but
they
also
said
that
the
mitsubishi
diamond
pro
is
the
next
best
choic
and
that
it
ha
superb

and
a
part
of
my
review
i
got

i
pick
the

even
though
it

choic
becaus
it
ha
a
the
best
clariti
and
text
is
not
fuzzi
at
all
the
viewson
is
the
worst
the
mitsubishi
is
much
better
but
the
nanao
fi
blow
both
of
them
out
of
the
water
i
dont
understand
whi
the
nanao
is
so
much
better

would
think
that
the
mitsubishi
with

trinitron
tube
would
be
better
i
can

one
of
the

i
review
for
the
june
issu
of
window
magazin
wa
the
mitsubishi
i
also
review
a
new
nanao
the
fiw
which
ha
just
been
releas
last
year
for
the
may
issu
of
window
i
review
sever
monitor
includ
the
nanao
ti
there
no
question
that
the
nanao
monitor
are
the
best
avail
thi
year
just
a
they
were
last
year
the
differ
between
my
rank
of
the
best
in
window
and
the
rank
in
window
sourc
is
due
mainli
to
a
differ
in
the
test
criterion
and
the
score
i
use
differ
test
than
they
did
and
i
score
differ
there
noth
wrong
with
the
mitsubishi
and
it
score
veri
highli
in
my
test
but
it
wa
a
few
point
shi
of
perfect
incident
one
of
the
thing
everyon
should
do
when
theyr
read
review
of
ani
product
whether
it
monitor
or
mous
is
to
read
the
criterion
and
methodolog
care
unless
you
know
how
the
product
test
wa
done
and
on
what
the
score
are
base
you
cant
possibl
know
what
they
realli
mean
just
see
that
i
rank
a
monitor
differ
from
window
sourc
is
meaningless
without
know
how
we
did
the
rank
likewis
it
imposs
to
tell
whether
a
monitor
will
meet
your
need
unless
you
know
how
we
did
the
test
after
all
some
of
what
we
do
may
not
appli
to
you
likewis
some
of
what
we
do
may
appli
more
close
in
one
review
than
in
anoth
you
cant
alway
tell
anyth
from
