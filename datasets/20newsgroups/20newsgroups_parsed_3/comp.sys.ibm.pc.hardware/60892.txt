courier
v
sportster
note
followup
to
compdcommodem
for
obviou
reason
in
articl
andi
nicola
write
in
a
previou
articl
holli
k
say
what
is
the
differ
between
the
u
robot
courier
vbi
extern
and
the
sportster
extern
i
see
that
the
price
of
a
sportster
ha
dramat
drop
to
below
but
the
price
of
the
courier
remain
abov
anyon
with
knowledg
of
both
of
these
modem
or
anyon
that
own
a
courier
the
courier
is
their
topofthelin
product
thu
the
higher
price
ive
never
taken
a
real
look
at
the
sportster
line
onli
courier
but
from
what
ive
gather
it
basic
more
of
an
entrylevel
modem
probabl
doesnt
meet
the
same
specif
that
the
courier
doe
im
not
sure
if
the
sportster
line
is
fulli
dsp
driven
like
the
more
recent
courier
modem
are
so
upgrad
in
the
futur
may
be
an
issu
again
take
all
of
the
abov
with
a
grain
of
saltiv
never
evalu
the
sportster
so
im
go
by
bit
and
piec
that
ive
heard
if
you
want
a
real
answer
post
the
question
in
compdcommodem
and
youll
find
peopl
who
have
work
with
the
sportster
person
though
if
i
were
go
to
look
at
the
courier
modem
id
buy
the
dual
standardthen
id
get
both
hst
and
vbi
in
fact
thi
is
exactli
what
i
did
im
sit
here

my
usr
d

a
flurri
of
folk
correct

to
avoid
spread
faulti
info
the
sportster
at
ha
v
error
control
and
v
bi
data
compress
just
a
it
doe
at
lower
speed
too
there
is
absolut
noth
in
either
ccitt
recommend
v
or
vbi
that
say
that
they
can
onli
oper
on
modem
that
are
run
vbi
vbi
of
cours
is
current
onli
standard
for
oper
on
top
of
v
in
it
primari
mode
of
oper
lapm
but
that
about
a
far
a
that
goe
and
just
in
case
there
some
confus
on
thi
vvbi
are
also
support
by
the
courier
line
unless
you
have
a
realli
ancient
one
the
differ
with
the
courier
is
that
it
can
run
at
and
onli
in
the
hst
mode
take
a
second
look
at
the
origin
question
in
a
previou
articl
holli
k
say
what
is
the
differ
between
the
u
robot
courier
vbi
extern
see
the
vbi
up
there
the
question
wa
not
about
the
courier
hst
modem
or
about
the
courier
dual
standardit
wa
about
the
courier
vbi
modem
the
modem
in
question
doe
not
support
hst
period
it
therefor
doe
not
support
the
kb
hst
also
not
all
courier
hst
courier
dual
standard
modem
support
the
kb
version
of
hst
my
dual
standard
onli
support
hst
at
kb
there
are
even
older
model
that
onli
run
hst
at
kb
thi
is
a
proprietari
mode
of
usr
and
it
will
onli
connect
to
anoth
of
the
same
type
unit
to
achiev
thi
speed
hst
is
usr
proprietari
modul
scheme
but
were
not
talk
about
hst
were
talk
about
vbi
vbi
is
most
definit
not
a
proprietari
modul
scheme
the
sportster
will
do
asynchron
transmiss
a
well
a
synchron
the
hst
is
one
way
onli
i
do
hope
you
didnt
mean
for
these
two
sentenc
to
be
relat
in
some
way
first
off
v
and
vbi
are
both
synchron
and
asynchron
thi
is
part
of
the
ccitt
recommend
ie
part
of
the
standard
it
isnt
a
featur
uniqu
to
the
sportster
i
just
look
at
the
appropri
chapter
in
the
courier
d
manual
second
hst
is
not
one
way
onli
more
correctli
put
it
is
an
asymmetr
modul
scheme
mean
it
doesnt
work
at
the
same
speed
in
both
direct
hst
oper
at
in
one
direct
and
ha
a
lowspe
backchannel
in
the
other
direct
the
highspe
channel
goe
in
the
direct
of
the
higher
data
flow
thi
is
fine
if
your
log
on
to
say
a
bb
and
type
one
letter
and
get
screen
of
info
back
transfer
file
not
use
bimodem
etc
there
is
of
cours
a
penalti
for
turnaround
time
when
the
highspe
channel
need
to
revers
direct
v
and
vbi
are
both
symmetr
mean
they
do
transfer
the
full
data
rate
in
both
direct
at
the
same
time
third
synchron
v
asynchron
ha
absolut
noth
to
do
with
symmetr
v
asymmetricalthey
are
two
complet
differ
topic
the
hst
will
be
upgrad
to
the
vfast
spec
when
it
is
avail
again
more
correctli
put
some
of
the
courier
line
will
be
upgrad
to
whatev
vfast
is
call
when
it
complet
if
you
have
the
larg
footprint
courier
modem
like
i
do
your
sol
there
wa
an
upgrad
plan
a
while
back
to
upgrad
to
a
small
footprint
varieti
which
could
eventu
be
upgrad
to
support
vfast
but
the
cost
of
the
two
upgrad
togeth
pretti
much
put
it
higher
than
just
buy
