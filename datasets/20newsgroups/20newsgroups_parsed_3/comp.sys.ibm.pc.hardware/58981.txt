h
these
question
can
be
answer
by
ani
dealer
of
ibm
valu
point
but
i
will
provid
some
unsolicit
advic
the
most
amus
kind
of
advic
today
tueday
ibm
is
suppos
to
offici
announc
the
introduct
of
the
vesa
local
bu
valu
point
system
these
system
still
have
onboard
video
and
disk
which
are
far
better
than
the
prior
valu
point
system
and
you
get
vesa
local
bu
for
futur
upgrad
we
are
go
to
buy
three
of
them
with
monitor
also
a
newli

and
one
of
the
three
will
immedi
be
upgrad

cach
scsi
disk
control
and
either
the
ati
gup
or

do
not
buy
a
sx
sytem
my
person
philosophi
on
upgrad
polici
is
that
it
is
not
lossfre
when

money
you
pay

spend
money
you
pay
tax
ie

come

go
translat
thi
mean
take
infrequ
but
larg
step
you
are
far
better
off
short
term
and
long
term
if
you
avoid
the
sx
model
and
go
straight
to
the
dx
