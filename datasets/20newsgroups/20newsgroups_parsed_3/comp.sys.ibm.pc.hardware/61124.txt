re
cpu
fan
the
attach
fan
look
slick
and
work
well
but
im
bother
by
the
potenti
loss
of
cool
if
the
fan
go
out
at
least
with
the
power
suppli
fan
you
can
reach
back
there
everi
few
day
and
feel
the
fan
blow
ye
thi
is
a
valid
concern
imho
with
the
directli
attach
fan
unit
ive
seen
it
look
like
if
the
fan
were
to
stop
the
chip
cool
would
be
a
good
bit
wors
than
no
heat
sink
at
all
in
other
word
if
the
fan
stop
the
unit
turn
into
an
insul
and
the
chip
might
get
hot
enough
to
suffer
perman
damag
not
just
stop
work
temporarili
a
suggest
slave
hook
in
seri
a
small
pilot
light
off
the
fan
circuit
then
if
the
light
go
out
you
know
your
fan
is
not
