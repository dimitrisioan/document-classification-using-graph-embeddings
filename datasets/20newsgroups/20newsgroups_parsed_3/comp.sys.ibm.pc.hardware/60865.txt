upgrad
the
processor
on
machin
in
case
anyon
wa
wonder
about
upgrad
their
or
class
machin
without
spend
a
lot
of
money
i
look
into
replac
the
processor
on
those
machin
and
here
are
the
fact
a
i
understand
them
if
you
have
a
p
model
or
model
you
can
replac
the
i
chip
with
either
a
cyrix
dlc
chip
for
which
will
increas
your
process
power
by
about
for
normal
fuction
and
not
at
all
for
math
function
thi
chip
will
onli
run
at
your
origin
clock
speed
ie
if
you
have
a
mhz
machin
the
cyrix
dlc
will
run
at
mhz
note
window
doe
not
use
the
math
function
so
it
is
a
good
upgrad
if
you
are
run
window
or
you
can
get
a
kingston
now
platform
for
with
a
mhz
isx
on
it
which
will
increas
your
normal
process
power
by
about
if
you
were
run
at
mhz
origin
but
again
it
will
not
increas
the
speed
of
your
math
fuction
i
think
that
it
will
continu
to
run
at
mhz
even
if
your
origin
processor
run
at
a
slower
speed
there
is
also
the
kingston
now
platform
for
with
a
mhz
idx
on
it
thi
might
speed
up
your
math
function
a
well
but
i
am
not
sure
if
you
have
a
p
model
b
or
other
p
machin
with
either
an
isx
or
a
nonclock
doubl
idx
ie
it
run
at
either
or
mhz
in
it
then
you
can
get
an
intel
overdr
chip
which
is
realli
an
idx
chip
and
replac
your
chip
with
it
you
should
get
about
better
preform
for
both
normal
and
math
function
the
mhz
version
of
the
overdr
chip
cost
and
the
mhz
version
cost
the
replac
for
the
mhz
sx
chip
is
an
espeaci
good
deal
a
it
provid
the
math
coprocessor
which
the
sx
doe
not
have
note
that
the
speed
rate
on
the
overdr
chip
are
the
maximum
speed
at
which
they
can
run
if
you
have
a
mhz
sx
then
the
overdr
chip
will
run
at
mhz
ie
mhz
extern
and
mhz
intern
there
is
no
reason
to
buy
an
overdr
chip
which
is
rate
at
faster
then
your
machin
you
will
not
get
faster
perform
you
should
be
abl
to
buy
these
chip
from
ani
of
the
microchip
merchant
that
advertis
at
the
back
of
pc
magazin
or

might
want
to
shop
around
a
price
