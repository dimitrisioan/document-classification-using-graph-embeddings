re
date
is
stuck
in
articl
john
bongiovanni
write
stuff
delet
did
i
onc
hear
that
in
order
for
the
date
to
advanc
someth
like
a
clock
ha
to
make
a
get
date
system
call
appar
the
clock
hardwar
interrupt
and
bio
dont
do
thi
date
advanc
automat
the
get
date
call
notic
that
a
midnight
reset
flag
ha
been
set
and
then
then
advanc
the
date
anybodi
with
more
info
there
are
two
problem
the
bio
tod
routin
which
updat
the
bio
clock
use
onli
bit
for
day
increment
so
a
second
wrap
of
the
clock
past
midnight
will
get
lost
if
no
one
call
the
bio
to
read
the
clock
in
the
meantim
and
the
bio
reset
the
day
wrap
indic
on
the
first
get
date
call
from
anybodi
after
the
wrap
indic
ha
been
set
so
unless
the
first
bio
get
date
call
after
midnight
is
done
by
the
do
kernel
which
is
the
onli
part
of
do
which
know
how
to
increment
the
date
the
day
wrap
indic
is
normal
lost
my
guess
is
that
kevin
menu
system
use
bio
call
to
read
the
clock
in
order
to
display
the
time
and
is
henc
the
entiti
which
caus
the
day
wrap
indic
to
get
lost
even
if
the
menu
system
notic
the
day
wrap
which
i
think
is
indic
by
a
nonzero
valu
in
al
there
realli
isnt
ani
particularli
good
way
to
tell
do
about
it
so
that
do
can
updat
the
day
the
menu
system
should
use
do
call
to
get
the
time
which
would
caus
the
do
kernel
to
do
the
bio
call
and
the
wrap
indic
would
henc
be
process
properli
possibl
though
the
menu
system
cant
easili
use
do
call
for
time
becaus
do
is
not
reentrant
and
perhap
time
increment
ofter
occur
while
the
menu
system
is
insid
some
other
do
call
