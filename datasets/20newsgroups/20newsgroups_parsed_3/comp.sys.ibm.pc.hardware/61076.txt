the
de
facto
standard
interrupt
assign
to
be
use
by
the
printer
adapt
to
announc
it
complet
of
some
activ
do
doesnt
monitor
irq
it
use
other
mean
to
determin
when
it
time
to
send
out
anoth
byte
to
the
printer
most
all
hardwar
printer
adapt
have
the
abil
to
disabl
the
use
of
irq
usual
by
mere
break
the
connect
between
the
isa
pin
and
the
associ
driver
other
adapt
control
the
irq
line
by
a
tristat
driver
and
by
program
just
leav
it
in
the
highimped
mode
unfortun
there
are
a
lot
of
adapt
card
which
use
bistat
driver
ie
either
assert
high
or
assert
low
for
the
irq
line
rather
than
tristat
driver
assert
high
assert
low
or
dont
assert
anyth
the
presenc
of
such
a
card
on
an
irq
line
preclud
the
use
of
that

note
that
there
no
requir
that
a
card
hold
the
irq
line
low
when
no
interrupt
is
desir
if
that
were
true
you
would
have
to
somehow
tie
down
all

line
and
that
certainli
isnt
a
requir
