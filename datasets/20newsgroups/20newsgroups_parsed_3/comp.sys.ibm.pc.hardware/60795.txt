by
our
local
comput
guru
that
you
cant
do
thi
unless
you
perform
a
low
level
format
on
your
exist
hard
drive
and
set
your
system
up
for
two

i
took
him
at
hi

i
have
not
tri

what
the
scoop

thank
in
advanc
also
bill
willi
do
not
do
a
low
level
format
on
an
ide
drive
unless
you
have
the
execut
for
do
so
suppli
by
the
manufactur
these
are
avail
from
bbs
or
mail
but
the
mail
version
cost
a
nomin
fee
in
addit
to
the
masterslav
jumper
on
an
ide
drive
there
is
also
anoth
jumper
to
indic
whether
a
slave
is
present
get
it
right
the
cabl
is
not
an
issu
a
long
a
pin
goe
to
pin
goe
to
pin
no
twist
or
swap
on
an
ide
cabl
be
sure
of
pin
on
all
three
compon
do
not
make
assumpt
guess
are
ok
but
assumpt
are
bad
if
the
cabl
and
jumper
are
correct
and
the
cmo
setup
is
correct
then
you
may
have
to
do
an
fdisk
follow
by
a
high
level
format
i
have
never
person
found
thi
necesari
but
perhap
there
is
someth
gone
wrong
with
the
data
on
the
disk
probabl
not
but
i
understand
your
predica
you
will
probabl
throw
salt
over
your
shoulder
wear
funni
cloth
and
do
a
spooki
sound
chant
while
