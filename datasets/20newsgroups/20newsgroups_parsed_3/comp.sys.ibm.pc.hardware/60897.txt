bu
io
not
do
float
point
not
do
bit
protect
mode
etc
thi
is
in
a
micron
comput
without
heatsink
i
recent
put
a
heatsinkfan
on
the
chip
but
i
might
take
the
fan
off
it
make
a
horribl
whine

go
away
in
about
week
of
use
mine
did
a
to
the
vibrat
well
that
someth
i
thought
about
to
a
i
have
a
tower
case
and
the
mb
is
mount
vertic
so
i
mount
the
fan
on
the
case
so
that
it
just
blow
air
at
the
cpu
and
it
heatsink
instead
work
just
like

charm
but
the
reali
biggi
to
think
about
is
after
the
whine
goe
away
on
