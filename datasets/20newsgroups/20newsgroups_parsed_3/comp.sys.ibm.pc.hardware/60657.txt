what
the
differ
between
load
mousecom
in
autoexecbat
and
do
devicemousesi
in
configsi
the
onli
differ
is
the
time
the
driver
get
load
mousesi
will
be
load
dure
the
configsi
and
therefor
befor
the
commandcom
mousecom
will
be
load
dure
autoexecbat
and
so
after
the
commandcom
which
one
is
better
mousecom
could
be
start
from
the
commandlin
after
the
boot
and
it
could
perhap
be
unload
if
no
other
driver
is
load
after
it
the
work
of
both
driver
is
total
the
same
when
i
ran
do
i
prefer
load
most
of
the
driver
in
autoexecbat
becaus
some
program
wont
run
with
some
driver
and
i
could
choos
the
one
i
need
dure
startup
but
with
drdo
thi
advantag
is
gone
becaus
drdo
let
you
choos
in
configsi
which
driver
should
be
load
