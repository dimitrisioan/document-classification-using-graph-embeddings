steve
russel
write
delet
the
attach
fan
look
slick
and
work
well
but
im
bother
by
the
potenti
loss
of
cool
if
the
fan
go
out
at
least
with
the
power
suppli
fan
you
can
reach
back
there
everi
few
day
and
feel
the
fan
blow
ye
thi
is
a
valid
concern
imho
with
the
directli
attach
fan
unit
ive
seen
it
look
like
if
the
fan
were
to
stop
the
chip
cool
would
be
a
good
bit
wors
than
no
heat
sink
at
all
in
other
word
if
the
fan
stop
the
unit
turn
into
an
insul
and
the
chip
might
get
hot
enough
to
suffer
perman
damag
not
just
stop
work
temporarili
i
prefer
to
put
a
stock
fan
off
the
drive
bracket
or
front
panel
to
blow
air
across
the
cpu
depend
a
lot
on
case
and
board
layout
though
my
zeo
dx
tower
case
ha
a
passiv
heat
sink
on
the
cpu
and
it
locat
so
the
front
fan
which
suck
air
into
the
case
blow
right
on
the
heat
sink
if
that
fan
stop
the
heat
sink
is
still
cool
by
convect
air
flow
so
should
not
see
too
dramat
a
temperatur
rise
essenti
the
arrang
your
talk
about
and
a
good
idea
imho
onchip
fan
from
fri
electron
in
the
sf
bay
area
are
about
i
get
the
stock
power
suppli
fan
for
