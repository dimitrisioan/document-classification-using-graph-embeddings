succed
in
convert
a
atari
monomchrom
monitor
into
a
mono
vga
monitor
if
so
pleas
let
me
know
exactli
how
you
did
and
what
graphic
card
you
use
i
wish
i
could
help
i
post
a
similar
question
about
two
week
ago
i
got
no
respons
at
all
ive
ask
local
at
my
friendli
atari
store
i
wa
told
that
it
should
be
possibl
but
that
they
had
no
idea
how
it
might
be
done
nor
did
they
particularli
care
to
investig
pleas
if
anyon
ha
ani
suggest
post
them
you
might
tri
ask
on
one
of
the
compsysibm
echo
the
best
one
may
be
compsysibmpchardwar
i
say
thi
becaus
the
convers
seem
more
gear
toward
a
pc
user
want
to
use
that
monitor
than
an
atari
user
who
alreadi
can
use
the
monitor
unless
mayb
they
want
to
realli
go
wild
convert
the
monitor
to
vga
then
use
it
a
a
vga
monitor
with
a
falcon
a
for
graphic
card
assum
that
the
atari
monitor
can
be
modifiedadapt
to
handl
vga
signal
you
should
probabl
be
abl
to
use
ani
vga
card
at
least
with
a
re
around
x
i
havent
tri
thi
but
that
would
be
my
guess
robert
anisko
you
might
want
to
price
mono
vga
monitor
anyway
it
may
be
cheaper
to
go
that
rout
than
to
do
the
convers
besid
with
the
falcon
and
beyond
vgasvgamultisync
monitor
will
probabl
be
the
way
to
go
