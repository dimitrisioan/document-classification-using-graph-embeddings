the
problem
becom
can
the

mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rate
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
scsi
come
from
not
the
interfac
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisim
to
use
the
scsi
through
put
given
the
origin
question
scsi
use
onli
a
a

is
it
then
necessari
to
get
a

that
will

scsi

cost
no
that
the

on

i
just

i
havent

scsi
ha
stood
rel

in
not
come

mainli
becaus
were

your
favorit
unix
workstat
that
is
after
million
of

buy
decis
over
the

scsi
ha
had
plenti
of
time
to
come
down
in

no
actual
were
talk
about
scsi
be
expens
simpli
becaus
nobodi
did
a
common
interfac
for
the

if
they
had
a
common
read
easili
implement
method
of
ad
scsi
to
a

like
a
in
a
sun
or
mac
then
youd
find
scsi
the
connect
medium
of
choic
i
wont
argu
that
the
scsi
standard
make
for
a
good
well
impliment
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
whi
it
intrins
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bu
when
it
come
to
multitask
os
when
manag
data
from
a
singl
scsi
hard
drive
on
a
singl
drive
scsi
is
more
expens
but
you
bought
your
pc
for
expand
so
youd
want
to
add
more
drive
or
whatev
the
follow
are
whi
i
find
scsi
intrins
better
than
ide
a
partial
list
you
can
add
mani
differ
type
of
devic
and
access
them
concurr
a
scsi
devic
work
on
mani
differ
machin
i
have
a
mac
and
a
pc
at
home
and
move
hard
drive
between
them
is
veri
nice
with
scsi
hook
them
up
and
away
they
go
scsi
devic
work
togeth
better

it
will
work
no

i
have
a
problem
with

i
notic
that
the
time
it
take
to
switch
from

drive
c
to

d
is
quit
long
a
compar
to
the
time
it
take
to
switch
from

on
a

system
under
a

o
thi
is
veri
notic
a
mani
thing
can
be
go

one
neat

that
ive
notic
