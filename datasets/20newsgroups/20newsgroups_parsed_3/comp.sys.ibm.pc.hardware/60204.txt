here
compar
to
the

paid

a
ch
flightstick
i
think
the

just
in
feel
best
thing
to
do
is

a
salesperson

let
you
tri
them
out
or
at

feel
it
befor
you
buy
just
anoth
note
analogu
joystick
are
best
for
flightsim
or
someth
that
need
sensit
touch
if
your
onli
play
game
such
a
castl
wolfenstein
or
some
other
game
that
onli
use
digit
input
ie
onli
up
down
left
etc
instead
of
how
much
right
you
might
want
to
look
into
a
gravi
gamepad
they
look
like
a
nintendo
