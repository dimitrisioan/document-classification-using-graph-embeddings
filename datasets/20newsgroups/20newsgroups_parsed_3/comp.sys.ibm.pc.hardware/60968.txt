but
there
are
restrict
at

with

there
is
no
way
to
boot
from
the
scsi
drive
if
you
have
both
ide
and
scsi
drive
you
must
disabl
the
scsi
rom
bio
im
not
sure
about
thi
though
and
so
you
must
also
use
some
special
driver
to
access
the
scsi
drive
hmm
i
know
that
you
have
to
disabl
someth
relat

im
not

you
might
get

higher

with

but
youll
also
pay
more
for
the

and
up
in
some
case
youll
also
pay
much
much
more
for
a
good

note
that
good
scsi

realli
show
their
power
if
theyr
use
with
a
good

oper
system
like
a

unfortun
neither
msdo
nor
window
is
a
good

the
perform

note
that
you
can

note
the

is
true
for

who

no

you
have
to
find

unless

these
are
typic
busmast

that
allow
you
to
connect
these

if

thi
doesnt

right
doesnt
it
it
true
though
with
one
of
these
control
youll
probabl
have
to
tweak
your
system
to
get
it
to
work
with
sound
card
floppycontrollerbas
tape
drive
like
the
cm
jumbo
and
window
i
know
ive
been
to
hll
and
back
get
my
scsi

to
work
with
variou
hardwaresoftwar
thank
god
for
tape
backup
if
you
want
a
copi
of
my
adaptec
hint
and
tip
file
send
email
these
problem
arent
realli
the
fault
of
the
scsi
control
card
the
problem
are
realli
with
the
gener
hardwar
and
softwar
design
of
the
pc
eg
no
standard
howev
ad
a
busmast
scsi
card
is
what
bring
these
problem
to
the
surfac
and
make
them
visibl
scsi
hold
a
lot
of
promis
but
you
can
run
into
a
lot
of
pc
compat
problem
if
your
plan
on
use
onli
msdoswindow
stick
with
ide
if
you
want
to
use
window
nt
or
a
pc
unix
youll
have
to
make
some
hard
decis
a
good
scsi
control
and
more
than
one
scsi
hard
disk
will
probabl
give
you
excel
perform
at
the
possibl
cost
of
msdo
compat
i
say
probabl
becaus
while
i
know
thi
to
be
true
with
a
pc
unix
i
dont
know
if
thi
realli
will
be
true
of
window
nt
i
suspect
that
it
will
but
i
dont
know
for
sure
