slow
in
write
im
use
inth
to
read
my
joystick
and
it
is
hideous
slow
someth
like
of
my
cpu
time
is
be
spent
read
the
joystick
and
thi
is
in
a
program
that
doe
noth
but
printf
and
joyread
if
you
onli
do
readprint
then
there
is
no
reason
for
the
joystick
stuff
not
to
take
of
the
time
even
if
it
is
effici
the
problem
is
that
a
lot
of
program
trap
inth
like
smartdrv
and
so
it
is
a
slow
a
hell
interfac
can
i
read
the
joystick
port
in
a
reason
safe
fashion
via
poll
and
that
isnt
platform
or
clockspe
specif
the
truth
is
that
int
h
joystick
read
is
slow
i
read
it
directli
from
the
hardwar
port
note
that
do
so
expo
you
to
intermitt
disturb
from
interrupt
so
you
may
want
to
read
say
twice
in
a
row
and
keep
the
lower
result
dont
just
turn
interrupt
off
it
may
prove
detriment
to
the
health
of
ani
high
speed
comm
and
