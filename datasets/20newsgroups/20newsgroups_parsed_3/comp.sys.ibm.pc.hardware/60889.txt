group
regard
extend
oper
of
my
gk
v
with
the
cover
remov
from

there
are
a
of
reason
i
am
consid
thi
includ
quick
access
to
jumper
dure
complex
io
card

my
concern
is
that
without
a
complet
enclosur
to
direct
the
cool
flow
of
air
from
the
fan
hot
spot
may
develop
on
my
motherboard
or
elsewher
my
gk
ha
intak
air
vent
in
the
front
of
the
enclosur
right
at
mb
level
these
vent
would
be
remov
along
with
the
top
cover
in
thi
scenario
render
airflow
from
the
fan
pretti
useless
howev
short
period
in
thi
mode
dont
seem
to
heat
thing
up
too
much
but
my
conclus
are
far
from
scientif
tim
i
ran
a
out
of
a
cardboard
box
for
more
than
a
year
with
no
major
effect
yeah
no
case
at
all
mb
sit
on
a
static
bag
other
than
the
nois
from
the
poersuppli
it
ran
pretti
good
a
for
cool
problem
i
bought
a
inch
fan
and
turn
it
on
full
and
set
the
output
directli
on
the
motherboard
i
did
final
get
a
case
though
and
i
am
still
run
the
part
with
no
ill
effect
i
also
had
no
kid
to
spill
thing
on
the
mb
i
had
no
cat
leav
hair
on
the
mb
etc
etc
on
and
on
