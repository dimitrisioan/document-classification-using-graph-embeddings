surpris
actual
after
read
thi
group
im
surpris
that
they
even
have
a
mhz
local
bu
run
i
have
a
choic
now
between
basic
the
abov
system
but
with
a
dx
with
isa
and
vlb
or
a
dx
with
eisa
and
no
vlb
and
thu
the
nonloc
bu
version
of
the
ati
card
which
is
better
keep
in
mind
that
im
primarili
interest
in
the
last
two
task
have
in
mind
the
size
of
the
imag
my
opinion
is
to
go
with
vlb
it
ha
much
more
bandwith
that
eisa
which
in
fact
can
be
util
by
the
craphic
card
i
have
not
made
measur
so
someon
el
may
share
experi
on
that
also
the
dx
is
faster
in
the
oper
that
run
off
intern
cach
slightli
slower
off
the
extern
and
about
the
same
off
memori
so
my
advic
is
the
vlb
were
quit
happi
with
the
ati
card
veri
fast
onc
the
data
get
to
it
slow
repaint
imag
under
photostyl
that
have
move
off
screen
or
been
uncov
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
enough
raw
cpu
when
run
desqviewx
it
sluggish
run
the
local
window
manag
also
mani
function
under
photostyl
take
a
long
time
even
when
the
imag
fit
entir
in
ram
there
not
enough
memori
in
the
system
desqviewx
and
a
meg
smartdriv
dont
leav
much
room
for
other
app
photostyl
will
page
to
disk
with
medium
size
imag
have
you
tri
run
photostyl
without
the
cach
no
need
to
have
page
and
cach
both
well
you
might
argu
that
the
page
is
cach
my
belief
no
measur
is
that
app
left
with
more
memori
will
manag
it
better
than
smartdrvexesi
i
have
perform
a
number
of
benchmark
on
the
ethernet
transfer
rate
thi
machin
sustain
onli
ksec
over
ethernet
while
our
sparc
sustain
ksec
on
the
same
network
go
to
the
bit
version
of
the
smc
card
increas
transfer
rate
to
ksec
still
veri
slow
especi
when
move
larg
imag
is
there
such
a
thing
a
a
localbu
ethernet
card
come
will
it
make
a
differ
im
hope
so
and
lean
toward
the
dx
choic
abov
for
that
reason
the
bandwidth
theoret
of
isa
is
over
mb
which
is
far
from
mb
i
tri
my
isa
ide
hard
drive
maxtor
mb
and
got
the
same
result
mb
regardless
of
the
isa
bu
speed
mhz
so
i
guess
that
just
the
carddriv
combin
is
lousi
also
are
there
dx
on
the
horizon
what
about
dx
dx
the
rumor
are
that
dx
if
ani
is
the
most
like
chip
to
come
out
but
note
that
ibm
is
closest
to
the
technolog
an
it
will
onli
sell
whole

so
youll
have
to
upgrad
