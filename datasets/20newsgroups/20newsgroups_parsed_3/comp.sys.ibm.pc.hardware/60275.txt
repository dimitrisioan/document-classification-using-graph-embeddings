happi
with
the

and
unhappi
with
the
card
i
have
spent
a
lot
more
time
futz
with
the
card
so
that
is
what
i
am
go
to
write
about
the
monitor
is
pretti
the
moir
i
had
under
simciti
on
my
magnavox
went
away
it
isnt
a
heavi
a
i
thought
it
would
be
lb
i
think
so
much
for
the
monitor
on
to
the
bitch
session
and
test
result
in
go
with
the
modern
trend
the
orchid
p
card
onli
support
color
in
x
mode
without
a
driver
of
cours
thi
break
ani
do
program
which
us
svga
mode
like
most
of
my
cdrom
the
compudyn
whiplash
vga
orchid
fahrenheit
and
orchid
f
vlb
all
share
thi
limit
those
are
all
s
card
which
mean
it
is
an
s
problem
for
them
the
p
us
a
weitek
vga
chip
which
also
doesnt
support
them
the
hercul
graphit
card
doe
seem
to
have
these
mode
but
i
didnt
run
the
same
test
case
a
i
did
on
the
other
board
dure
the
brief
time
i
had
it
it
wa
abl
to
print
the
splash
screen
for
the
grolier
encyclopedia
though
which
the
s
card
just
print
a
hash
which
is
whi
i
suspect
the
svga
mode
are
support
the
support
resolut
realli
annoy
me
you
can
do
x
at
hz
if
you
tell
the
driver
you
have
an
nec
fg
they
onli
have
about
six
monitor
list
plu
gener
and
if
you
choos
gener
you
cant
get
ani
high
refresh
at
all
but
at
x
you
are
limit
to
hz
seem
to
me
that
the
hardwar
should
be
abl
to
support
the
bandwidth
if
it
can
do
hz
at
it
sure
should
be
abl
to
do
it
at
higher
vertic
resolut
wa
the
main
reason
i
bought
the
card
over
the
orchid
f
vlb
i
current
have
and
it
will
do
xx
hz
a
well
the
higher
graphic
mode
all
crash
hp
dashboard
i
just
got
off
the
phone
with
orchid
and
with
the
driver
i
dont
know
what
i
have
he
wa
unabl
to
recreat
the
problem
on
the
plu
side
their
tech
rep
wa
a
help
a
he
could
be
and
boot
up
the
program
on
hi
comput
to
verifi
he
didnt
have
the
problem
he
didnt
know
whi
they
limit
the
refresh
to
hz
either
the
board
is
faster
that
the
ofvlb
for
most
thing
accord
to
the
hercul
speedi
program
thi
program
test
variou
oper
and
report
the
result
in
pixelssecond
i
dont
have
the
number
for
the
graphit
card
but
they
were
close
to
half
of
the
ofvlb
ie
slower
but
that
wa
run
in
a
mhz
isa
so
the
number
arent
realli
compar
the
follow
number
were
all
obtain
use
a
mhz
air
motherboard
umc
chipset
with
mb
memori
i
give
rang
becaus
the
program
report
the
number
a
it
comput
them
and
these
tend
to
jump
around
a
bit
k
mean

test
take

transfer
it

i
have
no

what
is
be
done
intern
a
far
a
convers
go
the
memori
to
screen
take
the
same
face
and
copi
it
to
the

my
guess
is
after
it
ha
been
raster
into
a
bitmap
that
can
just
be
copi
to
the
video
display
the

to

test
copi
that
face
from

on

awesom
interestingli
the
solid

and

polygon
show
no

and
hatch
polygon
ie
fill
with
crosshatch
and
ternari
rop
whatev
they
are
graphic
oper
like
xor
mayb
are
a
dead
loss
on
the
i
give
two
number
for
the
font
becaus
i
think
they
are
cach
when
the
font
are
first
drawn
on
the
screen
they
are
done
fairli
slowli
the
speed
of
the
ofvlb
then
the
speed
increas
dramat
sound
like
program
to
a
benchmark
to
me
i
make
no
claim
that
these
number
mean
anyth
at
all
it
just
what
i
saw
when
i
ran
them
on
my
comput
i
normal
dont
write
disclaim
but
thi
time
mayb
id
better
my
test
is
total
unconnect
with
my
work
i
program
under
