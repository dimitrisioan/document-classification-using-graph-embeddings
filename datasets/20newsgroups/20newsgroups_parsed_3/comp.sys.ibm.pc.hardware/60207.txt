onli
need
if

onc
you
do

with
the
chanc
are
that

probabl
becaus
you
happen
to

congratul
thi
appear
to
be
a

solut
you
are
veri
lucki
whether
your
luck
will
hold
out
remain
to
be
seen
if
your
system
is
run
much
slower
than
befor
thi
is
almost
definit
caus
by
smartdriv
with
doublebuff
accord
to
the
window
document
and
the
microsoft
technic
note
q
smartdriv
doubl
buffer
requir
with
aspidossi
you
must
use
smartdriv
with
doublebuff
enabl
while
thi
work
it
realli
slow
down
your
pc
i
onc
estim
that
thi
slow
my
pc
down
by
a
factor
of
five
a
i
consid
thi
unaccept
i
look
for
other
solut
unfortun
you
can
not
just
disabl
doublebuff
if
you
do
window
in
enhanc
mode
will
not
work
and
you
might
even
destroy
the
content
of
your
hard
disk
by
tri
to
run
window
what
you
can
do
is
one
of
the
follow
use
other
driver
that
provid
doublebuff
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
unbeliev
slow
in
smartdriv
is
caus
either
by
horribl
ineffici
doublebuff
or
by
a
bug
in
smartdriv
use
a
driver
that
provid
vd
servic
vd
stand
for
virtual
dma
servic
thi
is
a
standard
which
is
support
by
window
that
allow
busmast
disk
control
like
the
to
work
with
window
after
trash
my
hard
disk
countless
time
i
found
the
follow
solut
none
of
which
requir
use
smartdriv
note
howev
that
i
am
now
get
occasion
pariti
error
which
are
probabl
not
caus
by
these
solut
but
might
be
see
below
while
the
follow
doe
not
requir
smartdriv
use
some
kind
of
disk
cach
util
is
strongli
recommend
a
thi
make
window
run
much
much
faster
if
you
do
not
have
the
aspidossi
driver
or
you
do
not
need
aspi
function
for
control
a
cdrom
tape
drive
more
than
two
physic
hard
disk
etc
you
can
add
the
scsihasi
driver
to
your
configsi
file
eg
drivercscsihasi
v
window
need
the
v
option
thi
driver
must
be
load
into
low
memori
it
can
not
be
load
into
high
memori
and
it
occupi
about
k
a
of
novemb
the
scsihasi
driver
could
be
obtain
from
the
adaptec
bb
at
hope
it
still
there
if
you
need
aspi
function
and
have
the
aspidossi
driver
version
or
a
you
can
use
both
the
aspidossi
and
scsihasi
driver
in
your
configsi
file
eg
drivercaspidossi
drivercscsihasi
v
amazingli
enough
the
scsihasi
driver
can
also
be
load
high
assum
you
have
do
i
would
have
thought
that
thi
would
crash
my
system
but
it
doesnt
i
ask
adaptec
technic
support
about
thi
and
they
said
that
load
scsihasi
high
should
be
fine
a
long
a
aspidossi
is
load
low
on
my
system
not
use
scsihasi
with
aspido
a
would
occasion
caus
window
to
crash
upon
restart
or
exit
window
with
the
addit
result
of
a
corrupt
disk
some
of
my
cwindowsgrp
file
would
be
corrupt
for
me
these
crash
usual
occur
while
make
a
differ
program
from
progmanex
the
default
window
shell
and
viceversa
thi
is
the
reason
scsihasi
may
be
necessari
i
have
absolut
no
idea
if
scsihasi
is
necessari
with
version
of
aspido
earlier
than
note
that
mani
peopl
can
use
aspido
or
a
without
scsihasi
they
do
not
seem
to
have
ani
problem
at
all
i
consid
these
peopl
lucki
other
like
me
have
had
all
sort
of
problem
in
my
opinion
the
best
but
not
necessarili
the
easiest
solut
is
to
upgrad
to
aspido
the
scsihasi
driver
is
no
longer
need
unfortun
while
you
could
get
previou
aspido
upgrad
from
the
adaptec
bb
the
aspido
driver
is
not
avail
from
the
adaptec
bb
a
far
a
i
know
there
are
onli
three
way
to
get
a
copi
you
can
buy
the
new
a
of
novemb
adaptec
ez
scsi
driver
kit
which
supposedli
includ
aspido
a
well
a
other
driver
such
a
cdrom
driver
i
believ
the
list
price
is
around
if
you
alreadi
have
a
copi
of
an
older
version
of
aspido
you
can
supposedli
contact
adaptec
to
upgrad
it
to
ez
scsi
for
around
a
copi
of
aspido
is
includ
in
central
point
pc
tool
for
msdo
note
that
the
document
and
driver
are
store
in
differ
directori
note
further
that
onli
aspido
is
includ
the
cdrom
driver
and
driver
to
support
more
than
two
hard
disk
are
not
includ
thi
is
where
i
obtain
my
copi
of
aspido
note
howev
that
i
am
now
get
occasion
pariti
error
with
window
in
all
probabl
defect
hardwar
in
my
pc
is
caus
thi
a
i
upgrad
my
motherboard
just
after
i
found
the
abov
solut
howev
becaus
these
pariti
error
occur
onli
dure
disk
access
there
is
a
veri
small
but
definit
possibl
that
the
pariti
error
are
driverrel
for
exampl
chang
the
bu
onoff
time
for
certain
disk
transfer
might
caus
thi
ive
run
variou
memori
test
for
hour
at
a
time
and
these
test
have
found
no
problem
thi
problem
is
probabl
caus
by
memori
with

requir
which
caus

thi
is
whi

howev
im

there
are
two
possibl

with
use

such
a

thi
problem
might
be
caus
by
defect
hardwar
on
my
howev
ive
heard
of
other
peopl
have
similar
problem
and
so
im
mention
thi
just
in
case
it
is
not
a
hardwar
problem
on
my
tape
backupsrestor
take
a
long
time
if
you
have
a
floppycontrollerbas
tape
backup
devic
you
may
have
to
adjust
the
adaptec
bu
onoff
time
for
best
result
when
use
the
tape
drive
normal
while
do
a
tape
backup
or
restor
the
tape
drive
motor
should
be
continu
run
with
onli
an
occasion
paus
howev
the
default
bu
time
on
the
adaptec
may
caus
the
tape
drive
motor
to
start
and
stop
start
and
stop
everi
few
second
thi
caus
needl
wear
to
the
tape
and
tape
drive
howev
note
that
a
dirti
tape
head
or
a
defect
tape
drive
can
also
caus
thi
make
sure
your
tape
head
are
clean
thi
also
caus
the
tape
backup
or
restor
to
take
much
much
longer
than
necessari
the
problem
here
is
that
these
tape
backup
use
the
floppi
dma
to
transfer
data
in
memori
tofrom
the
tape
drive
and
the
adaptec
us
dma
to
transfer
data
in
memori
tofrom
the
hard
disk
the
floppi
dma
need
to
feed
data
to
the
tape
drive
at
a
certain
rate
if
the
tape
drive
is
not
fed
data
quickli
enough
by
the
floppi
dma
the
tape
drive
stop
rewind
a
bit
and
restart
onc
enough
data
is
eventu
fed
to
it
the
default
bu
time
on
the
adaptec
which
is
realli
dma
time
is
too
larg
for
exampl
when
a
backup
is
done
data
ha
to
be
transfer
from
a
hard
disk
to
memori
and
then
from
memori
to
the
tape
becaus
the
default
time
on
the
adaptec
hog
the
memori
too
much
too
much
time
is
spent
transfer
data
from
a
hard
disk
to
memori
not
enough
time
is
spent
transfer
data
from
memori
to
the
tape
drive
a
a
result
the
tape
drive
constantli
start
and
stop
becaus
data
is
not
fed
to
it
quickli
enough
the
solut
is
to
chang
the
adaptec
bu
onoff
time
the
default
factori
set
is
microsecond
on
and
microsecond
off
the
bu
on
time
need
to
be
lower
to
microsecond
thi
can
be
done
in
one
of
two
way
if
you
have
aspido
you
can
use
the
n
option
for
exampl
i
use
a
bu
on
time
of
microsecond
which
mean
that
i
use
the
follow
line
in
my
configsi
file
devicecaspidossi
n
note
that
there
is
no
space
between
the
n
and
the
if
you
dont
have
aspido
your
onli
recours
is
to
tri
to
find
a
program
call
setscsiex
which
is
veri
difficult
to
find
the
reason
is
that
adaptec
for
reason
of
their
own
doe
not
seem
to
want
thi
wide
distribut
i
onc
ask
someon
who
work
for
adaptec
and
they
ask
me
to
not
upload
it
anywher
if
you
have
anonym
ftp
access
to
the
internet
you
could
tri
use
archi
to
hunt
down
a
copi
i
believ
that
there
are
a
coupl
of
site
that
have
it
if
you
do
find
a
copi
you
run
it
like
so
setscsi
n
thi
adjust
the
bu
on
time
to
microsecond
run
setscsiex
without
ani
argument
reset
the
bu
time
back
to
the
factori
default
note
that
it
seem
that
you
can
not
use
setscsiex
if
you
use
aspido
setscsiex
crash
my
system
if
aspido
wa
load
i
could
use
setscsiex
with
scsihasi
howev
do
not
lower
the
bu
on
time
below
microsecond
or
increas
it
abov
microsecond
if
you
lower
it
too
low
the
hard
disk
throughput
will
suddenli
drop
your
system
will
feel
slower
for
me
microsecond
work
fine
thi
valu
may
work
fine
for
you
or
you
may
have
to
adjust
it
downward
a
littl
onc
youv
lower
the
bu
on
time
tape
backup
and
restor
should
run
faster
also
do
not
experi
with
the
bu
onoff
time
with
the
other
option
that
i
have
intent
not
describ
unless
you
know
what
you
are
do

the
tape
drive
didnt
work
well
attach
to
the
floppi
control
but
it
did
work
when
attach
to
a
differ
control
thi
could
be
an
indic
of
a
hardwar
problem
on
my
i
did
chang
floppi
drive
cabl
and
so
it
is
conceiv
that
the
problem
wa
in
the
cabl
i
dont
know
what
the
caus
realli
is
howev
if
your
have
similar
problem
you
might
want
to
consid
tri
a
new
floppi
control
sound
card
mani
popular
sound
card
can
play
or
record
digit
sound
and
thi
is
typic
done
use
dma
like
the
tape
drive
dma
the
adaptec
dma
can
conflict
with
the
sound
card
dma
unlik
that
of
the
tape
dma
thi
conflict
usual
manifest
itself
a
a
pariti
error
your
system
crash
with
a
pariti
error
messag
what
happen
is
that
data
is
be
transfer
so
quickli
by
the
sound
card
and
the
adaptec
memori
refresh
can
not
occur
quickli
enough
which
caus
a
pariti
error
usual
get
a
pariti
error
mean
that
there
is
a
hardwar
problem
with
your
system
in
thi
case
howev
the
pariti
error
is
not
a
symptom
of
bad
hardwar
ive
found
that
such
pariti
error
typic
occur
while
record
digit
sound
and
the
chanc
of
such
error
increas
a
you
increas
the
record
fidel
eg
higher
sampl
rate
record
in
stereo
record
use
bit
instead
of
etc
like
the
tape
drive
solut
the
solut
here
is
to
lower
the
adaptec
bu
on
time
see
the
section
on
tape
drive
for
inform
on
how
thi
is
done
note
howev
that
thi
may
or
may
not
solv
the
problem
it
may
onli
reduc
the
probabl
of
a
pariti
error
the
softwar
use
to
record
digit
sound
can
greatli
affect
thi
problem
ie
some
softwar
is
ineffici
disk
cach
the
