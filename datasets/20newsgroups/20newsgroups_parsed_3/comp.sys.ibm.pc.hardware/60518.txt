i
almost
got
a
hernia
laugh
at
thi
one
youll
probabl
get
one
when
you
realiz
that
your
vesa
super
dooper
local
bu
ultra
high
tech
control
suck
if
anyth
scsi
on
a
pc
will
be
obsolet
kill
off
by
vesa
local
with
ani
luck
pc
bu
archeitectur
will
be
doen

with
by
sbu
have
you
ever
seen
what
happen
when
you
hook
a
busmast
control
to
a
vesa
local
bu
it
actual
slow
down
your
system
bu
ide
it
must
be
real
nice
to
get
shaft
by
buck
for
the
extra
cost
of
a
scsi
drive
then
pay
anoth
for
a
scsi
control
yeah
there
is
absolut
no
use
for
vlb
except
for
video
graphic
and
no
ide
could
possibl
take
advantag
the
vlb
becaus
it
run
at
mhz
and
bit
do
peopl
forget
that
the
ide
wa
specif
design
to
interfac
directli
with
the
at
isa
bu
weve
seen
ide
come
out
for
eisa
xt
isa
and
now
even
mca
but
at
all
time
it
wa
a
bit
standard
run
at
somewher
near
mhz
when
you
run
an
ide
off
of
the
vlb
there
no
way
that
your
run
it
at
mhz
it
would
burn
up
of
cours
same
goe
for
scsi
esdi
whatev
none
of
them
run
at
cpu
speed
the
onli
way
to
gain
advantag
with
a
vlb
ide
is
to
hook
it
up
to
a
cach
control
i
suspect
it
would
be
much
much
better
to
get
a
softwar
disk
cach
instead
sinc
you
get
writecach
a
well
becaus
you
have
an
ide
and
no
one
make
ide
disk
that
big
