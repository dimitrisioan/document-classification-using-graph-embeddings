eg

i
and

i
there
are
also
devic
that
doe
not
requir
exclus

ie
it
will
share
an

with
anoth
devic
eg
lpt
no
in
a
standard
isa
bu
the
one
that
almost
all
nonlaptop
pc
use
two
separ
interfac
card
can
not
share
an
interrupt
thi
is
due
to
a
screwup
in
the
bu
design
for
exampl
if
your
soundblast
want
to
drive
interrupt
number
then
it
must
hold
a
certain
bu
wire
to
or
at
all
time
depend
on
whether
or
not
it
want
an
interrupt
thi
preclud
let
anoth
card
assert
interrupt
number
when
two
or
more
devic
in
an
isa
bu
pc
share
an
interrupt
it
becaus
theyr
implement
by
a
singl
card
interest
would
you
care
to
explain
to
me
then
how
my
soundblast
pro
card
and
my
printer
card
are
share
irq
success
i
assur
you
that
they
are
both
set
to
irq
and
that
i
have
no
problem
my
comput
is
a
dtk
ibm
clone
simpl
first
andrew
is
correct
although
i
can
see
where
there
might
be
some
confus
it
is
inde
possibl
to
have
two
card
configur
to
use
the
same
interrupt
they
can
not
share
the
interrupt
in
the
sens
that
it
is
not
possibl
to
have
both
card
activ
at
the
same
time
here
is
an
exampl
for
some
time
i
wa
short
of
free
interrupt
i
had
a
tape
control
not
a
floppi
tape
that
need
one
of
irqirq
it
an
old
tape
drive
my
solut
wa
to
use
irq
also
use
for
com
where
my
modem
is
i
did
thi
becaus
i
reason
i
would
never
be
use
the
modem
and
the
tape
simultan
when
kermit
run
it
instal
it
own
interrupt
handler
for
irq
and
us
the
serial
port
if
the
tape
drive
were
to
gener
an
interrupt
kermit
would
not
have
a
clue
what
to
do
withfor
the
tape
control
and
sinc
the
tape
control
would
not
be
servic
it
would
most
like
hang
likewis
when
the
tape
backup
softwar
run
it
instal
an
interrupt
handler
for
irq
that
handler
wont
do
anyth
for
the
serial

under

is
not

instead
the
bio
poll
the
statu
of
the
parallel
port
to
determin
when
anoth
byte
may
be
sent
that
whi
you
can
have
