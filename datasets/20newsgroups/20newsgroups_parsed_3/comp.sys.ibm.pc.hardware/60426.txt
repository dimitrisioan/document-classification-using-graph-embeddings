there
is
a
way
in
which
a
multitask
comput
actual
give
you
more
cpu
power
then
you
had
befor
and
that
is
with
io
overlap
with
io
overlap
your
cpu
can
continu
to
think
while
disk
oper
are
underway
wherea
without
overlap
your
cpu
sit
idli
wait
for
each
disk
oper
to
finish
and
disk
oper
take
an
etern
compar
to
a
fast
cpu
so
when
youv
got
multitask
you
want
to
increas
perform
by
increas
the
amount
of
overlap
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bu
master
either
of
these
make
it
possibl
for
io
devic
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memori
without
interrupt
the
cpu
the
altern
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
sever
scsi
interfac
card
that
allow
dma
and
bu
master
ide
howev
is
defin
by
the
standard
at
interfac
creat
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requir
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
byte
with
no
dma
