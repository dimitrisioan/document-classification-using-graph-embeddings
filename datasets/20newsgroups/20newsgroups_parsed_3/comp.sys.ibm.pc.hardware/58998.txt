i
saw
a
post
about
the
choic
between
dx
and
a
dx
i
wa
wonder
although
a
dx
is
faster
becaus
of
the
path
to
it
extern
cach
shouldnt
the
choic
be
the
dx
a
that
one
can
be
made
to
work
properli
with
a
localbu
i
mean
cach
speed
is
one
thing
but
all
your
speed
will
be
block
dure
video
io
so
just
get
that
faster
im
will
to
specul
that
the
dx
with
localbu
will
be
time
a
fast
a
the
dx
and
probabl
a
expens
or
cheap
technic
there
is
no
reason
whi
a
chip
set
can
not
support
a
dx
and
a
mhz
local
bu
im
wait
for
the
mezzianin
sp
vl
bu
that
will
be
decoupl
from
the
main
cpu
clock
and
allow
for
mani
more
slot
due
to
the
user
of
buffer
thi
will
allow
the
use
of
ever
faster
cpu
with
the
same
standard
io
card
until
the
