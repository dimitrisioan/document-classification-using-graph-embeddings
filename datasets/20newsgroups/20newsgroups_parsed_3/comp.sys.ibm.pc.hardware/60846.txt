boot
fr
on
tim
king
had
the
unmitig
gall
to
say
thi
tk
accident
discov
that
if
a
have
a
floppi
from
one
particular
tk
box
of
diskettet
in
the
a
drive
when
i
boot
up
rather
than
get
tk
the
nonsystem
diskett
messag
the
machin
hang
and
the
cmo
tk
get
overwritten
luckili
gateway
send
a
print
of
the
standard
just
a
wild
thought
here
but
how
about
thi
there
is
a
small
boot
program
on
everi
format
diskett
whether
or
not
it
contain
system
file
it
is
thi
small
program
that
print
the
nonsystem
disk
error
not
do
if
thi
program
tri
to
transfer
control
to
a
bio
locat
that
is
nonstandard
on
the
gateway
then
it
could
clear
the
bio
i
dont
think
that
the
bio
is
overwritten
there
is
usual
a
small
routin
to
clear
the
cmo
area
in
case
an
invalid
configur
prevent
the
machin
from
boot
i
think
that
the
boot
code
on
the
fuji
disk
may
inadvertantli
call
thi
routin
just
a
thought
