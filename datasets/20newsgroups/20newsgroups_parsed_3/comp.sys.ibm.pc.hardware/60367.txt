first
you
can
quot
scsi
spec
till
your
blue
in

but
if
they
exceed
the

capabl
then
what
the
point
who
said
isa
wa
necessari
eisa
or
vlb
are
the
onli
interfac
worth
invest
thousand
of
dollar
eg
a
new
pc
worth
of
money
in
then
dont
complain
mayb
it
wasnt
you
that
scsi
wa
so
expens
on
pc
becaus
all
weve
had
until
a
year
or
two
ago
wa
the
isa
bu
ie
no
one
buy
scsi
for
isa
becaus
isa
is
slow
are
you
say
that
scsi
on
an
isa
bu
is
not
an
automat
winner
when
compar
to
ide
you
didnt
read
to
care
vlbide
use
the
same
connect
mechan
a
standard
ide
if
transfer
rate
is
limit
by
ide
whether
it
interfac
to
isa
eisa
or
vlb
matter
not
i
get
differ
transfer
rate
out
of
my
ide
when
i
chang
my
isa
bu
speed
on
mine
for
one
thing
scsi
blow
ide
out
of
the
water
hand
down
if
ide
ha
better
throughput
whi
isnt
it
use
on
workstat
and
file
server
ide
is
just
a
variant
of
the
old
ibm
mfm
at
control
at
least
that
how
it
look
from
a
softwar
point
of
view
it
wa
never
meant
to
be
an
allencompass
protocalstandard
to
be
impliment
across
differ
platform
is
there
ani
argument
that
ide
can
or
cant
transfer
data
from
the
ide
drive
at
least
a
fast
a
the
drive
is
abl
to
provid
the
data
are
scsi
version
of
ide
drive
abl
to
deliv
higher
sustain
transfer
rate
to
their
scsi
interfac
becaus
of
a
higher
rpm
platter
differ
arrang
of
head
etc
given
the
origin
question
scsi
use
onli
a
a
singl
hard
drive
control
is
it
then
necessari
to
get
a
scsi
drive
that
will
do
at
least
mayb
megssec
for
the
scsi
choic
to
make
ani
senc
what
doe
a
meg
megssec
scsi
drive
cost
no
that
the
nice
thing
on
a
multitask
o
scsi
can
use
both
drive
at
onc
ive
got
unix
load
on
one
of
my
pc
along
with
windog
and
the
o
can
onli
use
one
of
the
two
ide
drive
at
one
time
it
pretti
ugli
if
data
is
go
from
one
drive
to
anoth
and
if
scsi
ha
the
abil
to
perform
that
transfer
without
the
data
have
to
go
through
the
cpu
or
main
memori
then
ye
that
is
the
optim
way
to
do
it
a
far
a
i
know
ide
cant
do
that
but
when
the
cpu
want
data
from
both
drive
data
to
be
store
in
main
memori
are
you
say
that
scsi
can
grab
data
from
both
drive
at
the
same
time
and
storetransf
that
data
to
main
memori
also
at
the
same
time
work
off
irq
and
dma
channel
on
an
isa
or
whatev
bu
i
just
bought
at
quantum
for
my
mac
at
home
i
paid
for
it
i
havent
seen
ide
drive
cheaper
a
friend
of
mine
just
got
a
maxtor
meg
ide
drive
for
that
million
byte
or
megabyt
with
the
basic
interfac
he
get
close
to
megsec
transfer
on
hi
doe
your
figur
includ
a
few
hundr
for
scsi
driver
no
actual
were
talk
about
scsi
be
expens
simpli
becaus
nobodi
did
a
common
interfac
for
the
pc
if
they
had
a
common
read
easili
implement
method
of
ad
scsi
to
a
pc
like
a
in
a
sun
or
mac
then
youd
find
scsi
the
connect
medium
of
choic
so
your
say
that
scsi
would
have
been
the
default
interfac
type
consid
that
the
vast
major
of
pc
dont
have
cdrom
drive
or
tape
backup
or
etc
that
most
pc
onli
have
or
had
hard
drive
and
run
do
that
scsi
hard
drive
cost
a
lot
more
than
mfm
or
rll
drive
at
the
time
and
how
common
were
scsi
drive
under
meg
to
year
ago
there
a
lot
more
than
the
lack
of
a
common
interfac
card
that
prevent
scsi
from
becom
the
connect
medium
of
choic
i
wont
argu
that
the
scsi
standard
make
for
a
good
well
impliment
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
whi
it
intrins
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bu
when
it
come
to
multitask
os
when
manag
data
from
a
singl
scsi
hard
drive
on
a
singl
drive
scsi
is
more
expens
but
on
that
point
is
it
faster
thi
is
what
all
thi
is
about
do
you
get
more
perform
for
the
money
for
all
the
peopl
that
will
onli
have
a
singl
hard
drive
in
their
system
regardless
of
the
o
will
the
scsi
choic
realli
give
them
more
perform
than
ide
but
you
bought
your
pc
for
expand
so
youd
want
to
add
more
drive
or
whatev
true
but
expand
can
also
start
on
the
bu
which
mean
the
option
is
there
for
cdrom
drive
or
tape
backup
that
run
off
their
own
card
you
can
add
mani
differ
type
of
devic
and
access
them
concurr
no
argument
thi
is
alway
held
up
to
the
first
time
scsi
buyer
a
the
best
reason
but
how
mani
scsi
devic
will
the
first
time
scsi
buyer
eventu
acquir
again
doe
it
make
sen
to
go
scsi
for
a
singl
hard
drive
system
a
scsi
devic
work
on
mani
differ
machin
i
have
a
mac
and
a
pc
at
home
and
move
hard
drive
between
them
is
veri
nice
with
scsi
hook
them
up
and
away
they
go
with
all
the
post
on
the
scsi
i
or
ii
spec
are
you
realli
sure
that
pc
and
appl
scsi
hard
drive
are
compat
and
even
if
they
are
is
the
data
access
from
either
machin
ie
are
there
no
format
partit
or
file
tabl
differ
is
it
realli
plugnplay
scsi
devic
work
togeth
better
than
ide
devic
for
instanc
recent
i
ad
an
older
connor
meg
ide
to
a
maxtor
meg
ide
the
connor
must
be
setup
a
the
slave
it
will
work
no
other
way
on
scsi
you
set
the
address
check
the
termin
plug
it
in
and
away
it
goe
so
the
c
drive
on
the
connor
becom
a
logic
d
drive
to
do
is
thi
realli
a
problem
i
have
a
problem
with
ide
mutual
exclus
i
notic
that
the
time
it
take
to
switch
from
access
drive
c
to
drive
d
is
quit
long
a
compar
to
the
time
it
take
to
switch
from
drive
c
to
d
on
a
scsi
system
under
a
multitask
o
thi
is
veri
notic
a
mani
thing
can
be
go
on
at
onc
after
have
two
ide
drive
in
my
system
for
temporari
file
transfer
i
have
never
seen
ani
differ
when
switch
between
drive
nor
have
i
ever
seen
ani
differ
when
transfer
file
between
drive
or
tofrom
the
same
drive
one
neat
thing
that
ive
notic
late
a
fring
benefit
ha
been
the
abil
to
add
older
almost
dead
drive
a
storag
on
a
scsi
system
with
littl
problem
weve
got
a
bunch
of
almost
dead
meg
drive
that
ive
ad
to
my
pc
ive
now
got
the
interfac
full
but
it
doe
allow
me
to
have
meg
drive
meg
drive
tape
drive
and
meg
drive
all
on
the
same
card
that
is
nice
a
long
a
the
power
suppli
can
keep
up
i
do
believ
that
there
is
the
possibl
for
up
to
ide
drive
on
a
pc
simpli
put
scsi
is
handier
than
ide
no
mysteri
jumper
to
figur

what
about
mysteri
and
expens
driver
to

at
