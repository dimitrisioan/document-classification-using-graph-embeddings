ohio
i
ran
out
of
time
on
my
last
repli
to
thi
string
and
i
dont
know
if
it
wa
sent
or
not
but
i
have
never
heard
of
anyon
that
had
to
return
someth
in
the
grace
peri
that
had
a
problem
at
all
with
midwest
micro
they
may
of
thought
that
you
didnt
know
what
you
were
do
and
suggest
how
to
correct
the
problem
but
it
sound
a
you
didnt
give
them
much
of
a
chanc
to
correct
thing
at
all
the
fact
that
the
ppi
work
okay
for
you
is
becaus
it
is
setup
more
for
the
no
noth
user
that
cant
understand
the
instruct
and
the
command
to
configur
it
to
hisher
system
when
you
find
out
thing
like
the
fact
the
the
ec
led
that
look
like
you
have
connect
to
anoth
ec
modem
doesnt
reali
say
that
but
that
it
onli
tell
you
that
you
have
ec
turn
on
on
your

i
think
that
these
led
are
noth
more
that
just
light
to
hype
up
the
product
just
like

bet
someon
took
home
a
few
extra

for
give
the
ppi
modem
the
pcmagazin
award
of

the
stash
of

saw
on

at
no
end
a
to
all
of
the
problem
that
i
found
with
the
ppi
