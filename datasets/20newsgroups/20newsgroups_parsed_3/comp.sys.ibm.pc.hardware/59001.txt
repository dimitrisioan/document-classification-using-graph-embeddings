mass
stephen
r
husak
univeris
of
illinoi
doe
it
do
it
to
all
tape
were
the
two
tape
that
it
unwound
of
the
same
type
from
the
same
batch
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
i
bought
some
gener
tape
that
did
thi
and
found
that
the
tape
marker
were
not
fulli
punch
out
and
had
close
the
littl
marker
hole
it
wa
onli
on
a
few
tape
of
a
set
did
you
open
up
the
tape
cartridg
and
put
the
tape
back
on
the
reel
if
you
have
not
yet
open
it
up
by
remov
the
two
screw
on
the
bottom
of
the
tape
cartridg
and
snap
the
plastic
shell
away
from
the
metal
base
a
you
are
pull
the
tape
through
the
assembl
tri
not
to
touch
ani
more
than
you
have
to
a
you
are
do
it
look
for
a
coupl
of
littl
hole
in
the
tape
these
are
the
marker
hole
which
let
the
tape
drive
know
when
it
is
at
the
end
of
the
tape
the
hole
are
space
a
coupl
of
inch
apart
my
best
guess
is
that
the
drive
find
the
first
marker
and
then
stop
on
the
second
marker
anyhow
if
the
tape
ha
the
hole
then
check
to
see
if
the
mirror
on
the
tape
is
clean
the
function
of
the
mirror
is
to
detect
the
marker
hole
the
tape
drive
shine
a
light
at
the
mirror
and
ha
a
pickup
in
the
area
where
the
reflect
would
come
out
when
the
hole
goe
by
the
pickup
detect
the
light
that
wa
allow
to
pas
and
it
know
when
to
stop
if
the
mirror
is
dirti
or
out
of
aligh
unlik
sinc
it
is
made
into
the
case
you
might
have
a
problem
detect
the
end
of
the
tape
if
the
tape
drive
doe
it
on
all
tape
and
the
tape
all
look
good
then
either
the
pickup
or
the
led
of
the
sensor
system
ha
fail
or
is
dirti
if
you
open
the
drive
door
you
will
see
the
sensor
assembl
to
the
left
of
the
rw
head
assembl
if
it
look
clean
and
noth
is
in
it
way
then
the
drive
may
need
to
be
servic
it
is
possibl
that
the
led
is
burn
out
or
the
sensor
is
out
if
it
is
still
in
warranti
you
might
be
abl
to
send
it
back
to
cm
for
repair
