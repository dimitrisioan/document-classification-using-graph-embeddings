thi
may
be
the
dumbest
question
of
the
year
but
is
there
a
way
to
piggyback
or
expand
a
slot
motherboard
all
bit
to
get
the
usual
my
case
ha
slot
for
and
id
like
to
get
a
scanner
but
with
all
my
other
card
im
alreadi
maxd
out
im
hope
that
a
simpl
solut
exist
eg
an
adapt
that
turn
im
not
sure
if
thi
will
work
but
how
about
use
one
of
those
t
expand
use
in
the
lowprofil
case
they
allow
slot
stagger
on
either
side
of
the
card
you
can
instal
it
in
the
last
slot
and
then
probabl
have
or
sideway
slot
thi
is
actual
how
it
is
done
in
the
low
profil
case
a
standard
motherboard
the
t
connector
in
one
slot
and
the
expans
card
plug
into
the
t
i
guess
you
could
do
thi
at
each
end
of
the
slot
to
add
even
more
the
t
connector
are
simpli
track
with
slot
on
them
no
electron
on
it
the
onli
downsid
your
case
wont
close
but
for
a
homebrew

that
may
not
be
