perform
suffer
that
much
for
a

so
drive
if
i
dont
have
a
tape
drive
or
cdrom
ani
help
would
be
appreci
so
when
youv
got
multitask
you
want
to
increas
perform
by
increas
the
amount
of
overlap
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bu
master
either
of
these
make
it
possibl
for
io
devic
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memori
without
interrupt
the
cpu
the
altern
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
sever
scsi
interfac
card
that
allow
dma
and
bu
master
how
do
you
do
busmast
on
the
isa
bu
ide
howev
is
defin
by
the
standard
at
interfac
creat
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requir
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
byte
with
no
dma
if
were
talk
isa
at
bu
here
then
you
can
onli
have
dma
channel
activ
at
ani
one
time
presum
transfer
data
from
a
singl
devic
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devic
on
a
scsi
bu
explain
how
all
of
those
devic
can
to
dma
transfer
through
a
singl
scsi
card
to
the
isaat
bu
at
the
same
time
think
it
the
scsi
card
do
the
dma
transfer
not
the
disk
the
scsi
card
can
do
dma
transfer
contain
data
from
ani
of
the
scsi
devic
it
is
attach
when
it
want
to
an
import
featur
of
scsi
is
the
abil
to
detach
a
devic
thi
free
the
scsi
bu
for
other
devic
thi
is
typic
use
in
a
multitask
o
to
start
transfer
on
sever
devic
while
each
devic
is
seek
the
data
the
bu
is
free
for
other
command
and
data
transfer
when
the
devic
are
readi
to
transfer
the
data
they
can
aquir
the
bu
and
send
the
data
on
an
ide
bu
when
you
start
a
transfer
the
bu
is
busi
until
the
disk
ha
seek
the
data
and
transfer
it
thi
is
typic
a
m
second
lock
out
for
other
process
want
the
bu
irrespect
of
transfer
time
also
im
still
tri
to
track
down
a
copi
of
ibm
at
refer
book
but
from
their
pc
technic
manual
page
the
fdd
adapt
is
buffer
on
the
io
bu
and
us
the
system
board
direct
memori
access
dma
for
record
data
transfer
i
expect
to
see
someth
similar
for
the
pcat
hdd
adapt
so
the
lowli
lowdens
origin
pc
fdd
card
use
dma
and
the
pcat
hdd
control
doesnt
that
make
