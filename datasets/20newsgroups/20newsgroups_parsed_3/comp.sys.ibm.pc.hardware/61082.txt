feel
like
floppi
these
drive
are
scsi
devic
and
can
read
and
write
both
kb
and
mb
disk
sound
to
me
to
be
one
great
product
for
the
pc
market
are
the
price
realli
that
unafford
compar
to
cdrom
which
are
current
not
rewrit
i
know
about
the
new
rewrit
cd
and
expect
soni

develop
the
first

my
question
is

there
ani
substanti
interest
in
develop
the
floptic
certainli
in
the
uk
the
mb
floptic
are
about
the
same
price
a
a
cheap
cdrom
now
you
seem
to
be
abl
to
get
them
for
around
gbp
howev
the
bigger
optic
drive
eg
mb
are
much
more
expens
around
the
gbp
mark
a
coupl
of
question
that
someon
may
be
abl
to
answer
the
mb
floptic
are
they
direct
drop
in
replac
for
a
floppi
or
do
they
need
driver
softwar
etc
ie
do
you
just
rip
out
the
floppi
drive
plug
the
same
cabl
into
the
floptic
stick
in
a
floptidisk
and
hey
presto
you
have
a
mb
floppi
thi
sound
far
too
easi
on
the
subject
of
soni
develop
md
for
comput
i
have
reread
a
pcw
articl
on
thi
subject
and
there
it
say
that
soni
have
been
do
optic
drive
for
other
peopl
for
some
time
and
may
be
about
to
do
a
product
themselv
from
the
articl
it
seem
that
the
audio
md
format
is
a
byproduct
of
their
comput
storag
work
the
md
mechan
is
ident
to
their
mo
comput
optic
drive
a
soni
spokesman
wa
quot
a
say
that
a
md
disk
would
hold
about
mb
of
data
though
he
refus
to
comment
on
ani
possibl
of
thi
be
product
the
articl
said
that
one
of
the
problem
hold
back
develop
in
thi
area
wa
lack
of
sensibl
standard
plu
there
are
at
least
distinct
optic

around
at
present
given
that
it
probabl
need
md
be
use
a
a
distribut
medium
to
get
it
into
the
market
and
sinc
thi
ha
alreadi
been
