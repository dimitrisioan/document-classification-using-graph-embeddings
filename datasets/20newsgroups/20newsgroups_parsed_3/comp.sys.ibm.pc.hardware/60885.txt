so
when
youv
got
multitask
you
want
to
increas
perform
by
increas
the
amount
of
overlap
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bu
master
either
of
these
make
it
possibl
for
io
devic
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memori
without
interrupt
the
cpu
the
altern
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
sever
scsi
interfac
card
that
allow
dma
and
bu
master
how
do
you
do
busmast
on
the
isa
bu
a
an
earlier
post
note
through
dma
ide
howev
is
defin
by
the
standard
at
interfac
creat
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requir
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
byte
with
no
dma
if
were
talk
isa
at
bu
here
then
you
can
onli
have
dma
channel
activ
at
ani
one
time
presum
transfer
data
from
a
singl
devic
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devic
on
a
scsi
bu
explain
how
all
of
those
devic
can
to
dma
transfer
through
a
singl
scsi

to
the
isaat
bu
at
the

ani
one

imho
a

xfer
if
i
have
four
sourc
of
dma
request
readi
the
dma
would
servic
the
one
after
the
other
if
the
bandwidth
for
the
four
togeth
is
lower
than
the
isadma

thi
will
work
note
