interest
would
you
care
to
explain
to
me
then
how
my
soundblast
pro
card
and
my
printer
card
are
share
irq
success
i
assur
you
that
they
are
both
set
to
irq
and
that
i
have
no
problem
my
comput
is
a
dtk
ibm
clone
run
msdo
or
a
deriv
o
obvious
plea
take
note
that
the
follow
is
not
what
exactli
happen
but
a
slightli
simplifi
explan
technic
the
irq
line
is
onli
a
mean
for
the
devic
printer
adapt
soundblast
modem
hard
disk
to
signal
the
cpu
that
someth
happen
here
plea
take
note
how
the
cpu
is
program
to
handl
thi
signal
is
usual
up
to
the
oper
system
in
msdo
the
interrupt
vector
is
use
to
store
the
address
of
the
function
that
handl
each
interrupt
now
basic
do
doesnt
care
whether
the
printer
report
that
it
readi
to
print
some
more
stuff
or
not
it
simpli
ignor
the
interrupt
when
do
print
it
look
at
the
lpt
buffer
if
there
a
charact
there
wait
a
while
and
check
again
if
there
not
copi
a
new
charact
to
the
lpt
port
sinc
the
irq
is
ignor
a
a
printer
interrupt
it
free
for
use
for
ani
other
adapt
in
thi
case
the
sb
with
ani
multitask
or
otherwis
advanc
o
thi
kind
of
print
approach
just
doesnt
work
or
more
precis
it
wast
a
lot
of
cpu
cycl
henc
you
cant
share
the
irq
with
lpt
and
sb
if
your
run
unix
or
o
or
whatnot
anoth
issu
with
the
sb
is
that
onli
the
digit
sound
use
interrupt
when
the
sb
play
plain
music
the
cpu
simpli
tell
it
what
to
play
until
told
otherwis
with
digit
sound
the
interrupt
is
requir
to
notifi
the
cpu
when
the
output
end
and
new
data
is
need
you
can
howev
hook
two
or
more
com
port
to
one
interrupt
but
use
them
onli
one
at
a
time
thi
is
becaus
the
interrupt
handl
routin
is
same
for
both
port
and
it
can
see
from
which
port
the
data
came
from
thi
of
cours
appli
for
some
other
devic
like
lpt
a

rememb
thi
