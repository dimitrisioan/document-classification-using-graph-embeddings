i
just
bought
a
new
ide
hard
drive
for
my
system
to
go
with
the
one
i
alreadi
had
my
problem
is
thi
my
system
onli
had
a
ide
cabl
for
one
drive
so
i
had
to
buy
cabl
with
two
drive
connector
on
it
and
consequ
have
to
switch
cabl
the
problem
is
the
new
hard
drive
manual
refer
to
match
pin
on
the
cabl
with
both
pin
on
the
drive
itself
and
pin
on
the
ide
card
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
figur
out
how
to
tell
which
way
to
plug
in
the
cabl
to
align
these
most
ide
drive
that
i
have
dealt
with
have
had
pin
label
on
the
print
circuit
board
thi
is
suffici
to
determin
which
side
is
which
if
your
ide
drive
doe
not
have
a
label
then
you
can
look
for
a
polar
notch
in
the
receptacl
the
connector
on
the
drive
with
the
pin
if
the
receptacl
is
center
polar
that
is
it
ha
one
rectangular
notch
about
mm
wide
posit
in
the
center
of
one
side
then
you
can
identifi
pin
a
follow
look
into
the
pin
with
the
notch
at
the
top
pin
is
at
the
top
right
on
all
drive
i
have
seen
thi
is
toward
the
power
connector
a
for
which
pin
is
pin
on
the
control
well
you
can
use
the
same
criterion
but
look
hard
for
the
label
of
ani
pin
onc
you
know
which
end
pin
are
on
or
pin
the
oposit
end
then
you
are
all
set
all
you
need
to
do
is
keep
the
pin
end
connect
to
the
pin
end
you
dont
even
have
to
look
at
the
cabl
itself
just
trace
the
pin
side
of
the
cabl
through
usual
the
pin
of
the
cabl
is
identifi
by
a
differ
color
red
usual
but
bewar
mani
cabl
maker

not
veri
care
about
thi
i
have
seen
cabl
with
pin
be
the
one
mark
red
of
cours
with
nonpolar
connector
thi
doesnt
matter
you
can
plug
the
cabl
in
either
way
and
you
decid
which
side
is
pin
secondli
the
cabl
ha
like
a
connector
at
two
end
and
one
between
them
i
figur
one

one
jumper
