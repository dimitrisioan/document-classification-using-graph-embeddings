had
similar
question
my
cent
worth
the
speaker
connector
should
have
two
wire
go
to
the
speaker
a
speaker
be
a
coil
it
bidirect
and
make
no
differ
which
way
you
attach
turbo
switch
there
are
three
wire
to
control
how
you
want
turbo
to
becom
activ
with
the
switch
push
in
or
the
switch
out
i
think
the
middl
wire
is
common
use
an
ohm
meter
to
figur
out
which
wire
connect
with
the
common
wire
when
the
switch
is
push
in
and
which
two
wire
are
connect
when
the
switch
is
out
place
the
appropri
two
wire
on
the
turbo
berg
connector
of
the
motherboard
led
turbo
and
hd
led
are
uni
direct
depend
which
way
the
wire
are
attach
the
led
will
not
light
on
my
ami
motherboard
if
the
turbo
switch
wire
are
not
attach
to
the
berg
connector
on
the
board
the
board
will
power
up
in
default
in
turbo
mode
if
your
motherboard
is
like
that
just
attac
the
led
wire
to
the
board
if
the
led
doesnt
light
power
off
revers
the
connector
and
tri
again
it
should
work
if
it
doe
then
attach
the
turbo
switch
to
the
board
