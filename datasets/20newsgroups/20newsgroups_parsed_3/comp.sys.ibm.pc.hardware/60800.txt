recent
i
have
been
get
a
cmo
checksum
error
when
i
first
turn
on
my
comput
it
doesnt
happen
everytim
i
turn
it
on
nor
can
i
predict
when
it
is
go
to
happen
i
have
an
ami
bio
and
all
of
the
set
are
lost
for
exampl
the
drive
type
and
the
password
option
howev
the
date
and
time
remain
correct
if
anyon
know
what
can
be
caus
thi
plea
let
me
know
most
like
reason
is
that
your
backup
batteri
is
fail
thi
batteri
maintain
the
content
of
the
cmo
memori
when
ac
power
is
turn
off
and
if
the
batteri
is
flakey
then
the
content
of
the
cmo
will
be
lost
and
the
checksum
will
be
wrong
along
with
most
other
of
the
cmo
data
tri
replac
the
batteri
if
howev
your
pc
doesnt
use
a
batteri
but
a
larg
capacitor
to
power
the
cmo
you
should
check
to
see
if
you
can
replac
the
capacitor
with
a
more
normal
lithium
batteri
if
thi
isnt
possibl
make
sure
you
leav
your
pc
on
for
a
half
hour
or
hour
each
day
thi
will
keep
the
capacitor
charg
id
opt
for
the
batteri
chang
though
it
also
possibl
but
unlik
that
a
rogu
problem
or
even
a
viru
is
corrupt
the
cmo
if
your
batteri
seem
okay
get
a
viru
scanner
and
check
out
your
system
