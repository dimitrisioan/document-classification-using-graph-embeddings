i
am
interrest
in
the
extrodinarili
simpl
concept
of
the
null
modem
cabl
actual
i
have
no
idea
so
dont
count
that
last
statement
what
im
ask
is
what
pin
doe
it
use
or
what
are
it
specif
i
just
want
to
solder
one
myself
instead
of
buy
one
i
dont
even
know
what
port
is
use
help
me
pleas
at
kevin
p
im
intend
to
use
the
cabl
for
pctopc
transfer
via
laplink
or
telix
idea
and
info
gladli
accept
i
do
not
have
specif
knowledg
of
laplink
or
telix
but
my
recommend
for
ani
packag
is
to
follow
each
one
instruct
for
make
the
null
modem
cabl
the
reason
is
that
each
one
may
be
differ
sinc
there
isnt
realli
a
standard
for
pc
to
pc
commun
the
follow
is
a
tutori
i
wrote
up
that
will
give
you
an
understand
about
r
and
null
modem
but
you
should
still
check
your
softwar
i
will
eplain
a
coupl
of
detail
of
r
r
is
a
commum
specif
for
commun
between
a
comput
and
a
modem
actual
it
can
be
between
ani
end
system
and
ani
commun
hardwar
the
terminolog
use
is
data
termin
equip
dte
and
data
commun
equip
dce
r
spell
out
the
voltag
level
the
connector
type
the
pinout
and
the
signal
protocol
the
connector
is
a
db
but
ibm
ha
set
an
altern
standard
of
db
the
primari
signal
are
transmit
data
td
reciev
data
rd
and
signal
ground
sg
there
are
other
signal
that
provid
control
between
the
dte
and
the
dce
for
exampl
the
dte
announc
that
it
is
power
up
and
readi
to
particip
in
commun
via
the
data
termin
readi
dtr
signal
dtr
is
an
output
on
the
dte
and
an
input
on
the
dce
similarli
the
dce
announc
that
it
is
readi
to
particip
in
commun
via
the
data
set
readi
dsr
signal
dsr
is
an
input
on
the
dte
and
an
output
on
the
dce
ok
that
five
signal
there
are
onli
four
more
of
interest
the
request
to
send
rt
signal
is
an
output
from
the
dte
and
an
input
to
the
dce
that
is
use
to
ask
the
dce
permiss
to
send
data
if
the
dce
agre
it
send
an
ok
via
the
clear
to
send
ct
signal
for
complet
the
ct
is
an
input
to
the
dte
and
an
output
from
the
dce
the
other
two
signal
of
interest
are
ring
indic
ri
and
data
carrier
detect
dcd
these
are
both
input
to
the
dte
and
output
from
the
dce
ri
is
just
what
you
would
expect
a
signal
to
the
dte
say
that
someon
is
attempt
to
establish
a
connect
to
the
dce
thi
is
rather
specif
to
the
modem
telephon
line
setup
dcd
is
a
way
for
the
dce
to
announc
that
the
connect
ha
been
establish
ie
the
local
dce
is
talk
to
some
remot
dce
there
that
it
oh
there
are
mani
other
r
signal
defin
but
they
are
obsolet
i
have
explain
the
nine
signal
that
are
on
a
pc
the
pinout
are
a
follow
name
db
db
sg
td
rd
dtr
dsr
dcd
rt
ct
ri
now
to
address
your
problem
at
hand
when
you
connect
a
pc
to
a
pc
a
dte
to
a
dte
there
is
no
dce
pair
in
the
middl
and
therefor
the
r
signal
definit
dont
work
out
quit
right
there
is
no
dce
to
assert
the
ct
dsr
dcd
or
ri
so
the
common
thing
to
do
is
to
not
use
these
signal
at
all
and
also
forget
about
the
dtr
and
rt
output
a
well
if
thi
is
done
you
simpli
make
a
null
modem
a
cabl
that
pass
through
sg
and
cross
td
and
rd
ie
pin
of
one
end
connect
to
pin
at
the
other
end
etc
the
problem
with
thi
solut
is
that
a
pc
that
want
to
send
data
ha
no
way
of
know
if
the
other
pc
is
readi
it
would
have
to
just
send
the
data
and
hope
it
got
through
therefor
a
better
null
modem
would
includ
the
dtrdsr
pair
cross
a
particular
point
a
confus
is
in
the
softwar
area
just
becaus
you
run
the
wire
doe
not
mean
that
the
soft
ware
will
use
them
if
you
are
use
the
builtin
bio
to
control
the
serial
port
then
the
bio
dictat
what
wire
you
need
and
how
they
are
to
be
use
but
if
you
have
a
comm
packag
such
a
brooklyn
bridg
or
lap
link
or
telix
then
those
packag
dictat
the
cabl
requir
the
onli
thing
you
can
guess
reliabl
is
the
sg
td
and
rd
the
dtrdsr
is
also
fairli
common
there
is
one
more
issu
that
need
to
be
address
here
and
that
is
flow
control
in
the
r
scenerio
the
dce
are
respons
for
flow
control
and
it
is
assum
that
the
dce
couldnt
possibl
overrun
the
dte
by
thi
i
mean
that
a
long
a
the
dte
ha
it
dtr
line
assert
the
dce
will
send
data
without
request
permiss
first
note
the
contrast
to
the
other
direct
of
data
flow
the
dte
must
request
permiss
by
assert
the
rt
line
and
it
must
wait
for
the
ct
signal
befor
it
can
send
and
now
in
the
dte
to
dte
scenerio
the
question
is
do
you
need
flow
control
the
answser
is
usual
but
how
for
nonbinari
commun
one
common
techniqu
is
xon
xoff
which
is
implement
in
softwar
no
wire
are
dedic
to
flow
control
the
td
and
rd
carri
the
xon
and
xoff
command
thi
type
of
flow
control
can
be
use
in
addit
to
hardwar
flow
control
but
the
problem
is
that
you
cant
send
binari
data
becaus
your
data
might
includ
the
xon
or
xoff
code
and
caus
erron
conrol
signal
a
work
around
is
to
have
the
softwar
insert
and
extract
escap
code
but
the
hardwar
flow
control
is
prefer
the
problem
with
hard
ware
flow
control
is
that
there
is
no
standard
there
are
lot
of
way
to
do
it
and
i
bet
they
have
all
been
tri
one
cornerston
of
all
the
method
is
to
use
the
rtsct
for
one
direct
but
beyond
that
anyth
is
fair
game
again
you
must
look
to
you
comm
packag
for
cabl
requir
but
i
bet
youll
find
that
one
cabl
if
wire
properli
could
work
with
all
of
the
packag
a
long
a
they
are
of
the
same
vintag
by
the
way
i
am
familiar
with
one
packag
that
us
rtsct
and
dtrdsr
for
flow
control
the
rt
is
request
to
send
and
the
dtr
is
readi
to
reciev
the
ct
is
the
clear
to
send
and
the
dsr
is
the
request
to
reciev
thi
doe
not
mean
a
differnt
cabl
it
is
just
softwar
the
clincher
to
all
of
thi
cabl
stuff
is
that
it
is
common
to
have
the
uart
directli
control
by
the
ct
signal
which
mean
that
the
ct
must
be
present
even
if
you
are
not
support
ing
it
in
softwar
for
these
case
you
will
find
cabl
that
short
the
rt
to
the
ct
at
the
same
end
or
perhap
the
dtr
to
the
ct
other
possibl
short
might
be
done
just
becaus
the
softwar
expect
certain
signal
that
you
dont
have
or
dont
feel
like
provid
becaus
it
would
mean
addit
wire
specif
i
am
talk
about
the
dsr
short
the
dtr
to
the
dsr
is
not
a
good
idea
in
gener
but
you
may
find
cabl
like
thi
it
is
a
bad
idea
becaus
it
defeat
the
whole
purpos
one
more
gotcha
signal
is
the
dcd
some
softwar
includ
the
pc
bio
expect
to
see
the
dcd
befor
it
will
work
thi
signal
sometim
get
short
with
the
dtr
but
my
favorit
null
modem
ha
the
rt
and
ct
short
at
each
end
but
the
rt
is
also
connect
through
to
the
other
end
and
connect
to
dcd
and
of
cours
the
dtrdsr
are
cross
a
are
the
tdrd
and
of
cours
the
sg
must
pa
through
thi
null
modem
work
with
most
softwar
the
flow
control
if
ani
can
use
the
rtsdcd
with
the
dtrdsr
if
your
comm
packag
doe
not
specifi
the
cabl
requir
for
pc
to
pc
connect
then
i
suggest
you
use
