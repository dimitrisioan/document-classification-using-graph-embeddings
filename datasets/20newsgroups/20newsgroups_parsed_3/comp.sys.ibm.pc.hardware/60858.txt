and
most
ad

also
use
dma
dma
is
no
big
deal
and
ha
noth
to
do
directli
with
scsi
no
the
simpl
style
ide
control
doe
not
use
dma
the
cpu
perform
the
data
transfer
with
a
string
move
instruct
thi
requir
that
the
cpu
stop
what
it
had
been
do
and
transfer
the
data
onli
the
smart
drive
control
be
they
ide
or
scsi
can
transfer
via
dma
these
control
tend
to
cost
the
same
wether
they
are
ide
or
scsi
to
get
the

benefit
ide
must
sacrific
it
price
advantag
on
the
control
for
exampl
when
rewind
or
format
a
tape
the
command
is
issu
to
the
control
and
the
bu
is
releas
to
allow
access
to
other
devic
on
the
bu
thi
greatli
increas
product
or
at
least
do
someth
el
while
back
up
your
hard
drive
which
happen
to
be
what
i
am
do
while
read
thi
group
you
can
thank
your
softwar
for
that
if
do
had
a
few
more
brain
it
could
format
floppi
etc
while
you
were
do
someth
el
the
hardwar
will
support
it
but
do
at
least
wont
again
thi
ha
noth
to
do
with
scsi
floppi
arent
on
the
ide
bu
your
arguement
make
no
sen
thi
isnt
an
ide
issu
the
floppi
have
their
own
processor
on
their
control
board
which
handl
all
of
these
command
the
differ
between
ide
and
scsi
is
that
all
scsi
peripheri
are
intellig
they
each
have
their
own
control
they
depend
on
the
cpu
to
do
fewer
thing
for
them
ie
ide
drive
need
a
processor
to
transfer
their
data
it
a
long
stori
but
i
still
use
ide
on
my
except
for
the
cdrom
which
thank
to
scsi
i
can
move
between
both
machin
if
and
when
scsi
is
better
standard
and
support
on
the
ibmclon
machin
i
plan
to
complet
get
rid
of
ide
and
if
you
stick
with
do
youll
wonder
whi
you
cant
multitask
again
i
ask
whi
cant
a
unix
or
o
type
o
do
all
the
miracul
thing
with
an
ide
harddriv
that
it
can
with
a
singl
scsi
hard
drive
the
dettachcallback
mechan
alow
the
cpu
to
make
request
of
the
devic
on
the
scsi
bu
and
then
dettach
and
go
about
it
busi
later
when
the
devic
is
done
it
issu
a
callback
to
say
that
the
data
ha
arriv
or
the
function
ha
complet
most
scsi
card
will
also
dma
the
data
into
memori
without
the
interupt
the
cpu
therefor
allow
it
to
continu
work
uninterupt
ide
support
no
such
concept
a
dettachcallback
can
you
see
how
thi
would
be
a
win
in
ani
multitask
