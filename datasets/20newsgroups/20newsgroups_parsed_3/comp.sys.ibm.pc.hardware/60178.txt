i

scsi
wa

if
we

the
most

drive
can

you

if
they
exceed

then
what
the

the

becom
can
the

mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rate
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
scsi
come
from
not
the
interfac
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisim
to
use
the
scsi
through
put
given
the
origin
question
scsi
use
onli
a
a
singl
hard

control
is
it
then
necessari
to
get
a

that

cost
the
cost
of
scsi
interfac
is
a
self
fullil
prophisi
few
peopl
buy
scsi
becaus
it
is
so
expenc
for
the
pc
which
in
turn
convic
make
that
mass
produc
scsi
which
would
reduc
it
cost
is
unwar
and
so
scsi
is
expenc
that
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
of
scale
the
more
item
sold
the
le
each

ha
to

the

of

so
the

in
not
come

mainli
becaus

decis
over

scsi
ha
had
plenti
of

to

i
wont
argu
that
the
scsi
standard
make
for
a
good
well
impliment
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
whi
it
intrins
better
than
ide
on
an
