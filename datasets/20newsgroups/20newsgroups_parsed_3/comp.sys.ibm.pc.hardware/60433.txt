follow
the

thread
while
wait
for
mine
to
arriv
in
the

there
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
complaint
about
minor
align
problem
with
the
mxf
one
articl
contain
a
comment
that
the
owner
call
the
factori
and
wa
told
that
hi
screen
rotat
wa
within
spec
that
figur
for
imag
rotat
would
seem
to
be
a
littl
high
on
my
nec
fg
the
spec
call
for
no
greater
than
mm
well
my
monitor
arriv
last
night
and
sure
enough
it
ha
a
veri
notic
barrel
distort
it
not
dramat
but
it
is
there
and
it
is
especi
notic
when
the
imag
doesnt
fill
the
entir
screen
the
fact
that
it
is
wors
on
the
right
side
doesnt
help
matter
what
im
tri
to
find
out
is
if
these
minor
imperfect
are
the
norm
or
are
most
of
their
monitor
perfect
i
dont
want
to
send
it
back
and
get
one
with
the
same
or
an
even
wors
problem
doe
the
factori
consid
thi
kind
of
thing
normal
and
ship
their
monitor
with
le
than
perfect
align
i
cant
speak
for
mag
innovis
but
a
far
a
nec
is
concern
they
are
adjust
to
factoryspec
befor
leav
the
central
usa
distribut
point
ma
for
the
eastern
canadian
market
now
here
the
key
nec
know
that
the
monitor
adjust
are
veri
sensit
to
ship
over
distanc
with
all
the
bump
rough
handl
and
such
and
therefor
expect
and
at
least
in
theori
requir
that
the
local
distributor
not
dealer
have
it
adjust
at
the
local
servic
centr
bull
hn
inform
system
in
toronto
befor
sale
thi
is
the
correct
and
probabl
onli
way
of
have
ani
chanc
of
receiv
a
perfect
monitor
the
definit
of
perfect
seem
to
depend
on
how
picki
one
is
in
my
case
quit
are
other
netter
just
live
with
these
kind
of
imperfect
i
for
one
wa
not
will
to
accept
what
i
consid
a
substandard
monitor
and
after
two
month
of
wrangl
and
direct
contact
with
nec
final
receiv
a
satisfactorili
adjust
monitor
not
perfect
imho
but
a
major
improv
over
what
the
dealer
and
distributor
were
tri
convinc
me
wa
normal
the
short
answer
is
no
dont
accept
these
imperfect
a
normal
becaus
for
the
premium
one
pay
for
the
larger
screen
monitor
one
ha
a
right
to
expect
higher
qualiti
and
if
your
