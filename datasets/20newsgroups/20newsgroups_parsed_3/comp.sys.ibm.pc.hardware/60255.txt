what
are
the
current
product
avail
to
upgrad
the
resolut
which
one
support
postscript
ani
experi
with
them
either
good
or
bad
is
the
qualiti
differ
realli
notic
im
plan
on
produc
camera
readi
copi
of
home
will
the
higher
resolut
be
notic
for
these
if
you
are
talk
about
laser
jet
then
i
believ
it
ha
to
be
postscript
i
dont
see
ani
advantag
to
use
pcl
when
you
have
a
peic
of
hardwar
plug
into
the
lj
that
is
do
the
work
and
it
can
support
ani
languag
that
is
suit
for
the
job
besid
i
dont
think
pcl
is
even
capabl
of
handl
dpi
specif
i
onli
have
experi
with
the
laser
master
winjet
which
bring
the
lj
up
to
dpi
and
it
use
postscript
it
also
ha
a
fast
print
mode
which
is
not
postscript
and
it
is
at
a
lower
resolut
dpi
i
think
but
it
is
fast
thi
particular
product
use
your
host
processor
to
process
the
postscript
so
even
with
a
decent
pc
you
know
it
go
to
be
slow
ie
slow
compar
to
a
highend
workstat
process
p
the
qualiti
differ
is
veri
notic
and
is
almost
worth
the
wait
for
the
p
process
im
rather
impati
we
were
use
it
for
bw
camera
imag
r
the
gray
scale
imag
wa
accept
by
m
word
and
hand
to
the
winjet
p
printer
driver
which
convert
the
imag
into
postscript
and
then
hand
it
off
to
the
winjet
postscript
processor
the
postscript
is
render
into
ram
lot
of
it
and
when
it
is
done
it
shoot
it
directli
to
the
printer
the
p
processor
can
also
accept
p
file
creat
from
other
sourc
includ
do
applic
but
window
ha
to
be
run
at
the
time
of
print
the
p
processor
is
respons
for
the
halfton
and
id
say
it
doe
a
pretti
good
job
our
camera
imag
came
out
veri
good
in
my
opinion
not
a
good
a
laser
master
demo
though
i
dont
know
how
mani
other
similar
product
are
out
there
but
i
would
be
surpris
if
there
are
sever
gordon
