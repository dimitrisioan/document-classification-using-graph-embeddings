a
better
futur
and
it
ha
a
lot
of
minor
advantag
right
now
ide
card
are
cheaper
right
now
but
will
be
obsolet
in
a
few
year
in
fact
ide
card
are
so
cheap
they
might
a
well
be
free
the
real
cost
is
in
the
ide
drive
scsi
card
cost
more
but
they
are
worth
it
i
almost
got
a
hernia
laugh
at
thi
one
youll
probabl
get
one
when
you
realiz
that

have
you
ever
seen
what
happen
when
you
hook
a
busmast
control
to
a
vesa
local
bu
it
actual
slow
down
your
system
bu
ide
it
must
be
real
nice
to
get
shaft
by
buck
for
the
extra
cost
of
a
scsi
drive
then
pay
anoth
for
a
scsi
control
mayb
my
workstat
doesnt
understand
what
your
vesa
local
bu
ide
is
vesa
local
bu
will
be
kill
off
by
pcmi
whatev
intel
spec
is
vlbu
it
not
good
for
much
more
than
vga
card
to
each
hi
own
ill
laugh
when
you
start
cri
over
how
much
you
spent
for
your
littl
ide
drive
and
then
find
out
you
need
more
space
the
biggest
advantag
of
scsi
right
now
is
that
you
can
add
more
differ
kind
of
devic
such
a
tape
etc
easili
and
can
add
bigger
disk
the
best
and
most
cost
effect
hard
disk
avail
are
scsi
here
here
onli
of
you
need
drive
larger
then
meg
oh
ye
got
ta
have
megssec
transfer
rate
for
those
speedi
tape
backup
and
cd
rom
drive
dont
stick
your
foot
in
your
mouth
when
you
make
a
statement
you
know
noth
about
id
rather
wait
a
second
compar
to
the
minut
and
ide
would
take
obvious
exagger
have
you
ever
tri
to
backup
gig
of
disk
oh
i
forgot
you
cant
becaus
you
have
an
ide
and
no
one
make
ide
disk
that
big
basic
if
a
person
ha
to
ask
which
one
is
better
for
himher
then
they
will
probabl
never
see
the
expens
benefit
from
scsi
i
guess
you
probabl
bought
a
sx
too
also
all
thi
armwav
about
scsi
expand
is
a
moot
point
if
the
user
onli
ha
one
or
two
drive
on
it
and
with
scsi
those
two
drive
may
be
fast
but
that
speed
is
onli
due
to
the
onboard
memori
cach
someth
i
can
duplic
with
a
cach
ide
control
what
the
scsi
fastwid
spec
ha
much
more
bandwidth
than
ani
stupid
vlbu
ide
crap
stop
thi
thread
now
it
just
clutter
up
bandwidth
if
you
want
to
read
about
scsi
v
ide
just
pay
a
visit
to
you
local
usenet
archiv
the
best
scsi
fastwideetc
is
clearli
faster
than
ani
the
best
ide
drive
all
the
respons
given
are
base
upon
person
experi
with
or
drive
you
cant
judg
such
complet
differ
interfac
ide
ha
the
low
cost
adavantag
a
descent
perform
scsi
ha
the
abil
for
super
high
capac
expand
and
speed
neither
one
is
better
in
all
case
if
you
dont
beliv
what
i
said
about
busmast
and
vlbu
then
pick
up
