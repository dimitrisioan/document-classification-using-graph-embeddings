i
dont
understand
si
mgjoohwe
student
wrote
mg
i
went
buy
simm
recent
and
the
sale
person
told
me
that
the
mg
are
chip
simm
and
chip
simm
and
one
can
not
use
them
interchan
mg
if
you
use
one
you
have
to
use
all
of
the
same
type
dont
believ
everyth
you
are
told
i
can
tell
you
that
mix
them
between
bank
ok
and
i
cant
see
whi
mix
in
one
bank
is
not
unless
they
are
of
differ
speed
eg
mix
of
n
and
n
simm
in
one
bank
the
two
onli
differ
in
the
type
of
chip
it
use
assum
that
the
simm
are
mx
bit
wide
here
is
the
two
equival
configur
the
chip
simm
use
two
bit
wide
mbit
m
of
bit
nibbl
and
one
bit
wide
mbit
chip
for
a
total
of
bit
wide
mbyte
the
bit
simm
use
nine
bit
wide
mbit
chip
these
are
equival
becaus
of
the
way
that
it
is
pin
on
the
simm
board
at
the
simm
interfac
they
both
act
a
bit
wide
mbyte
simm
sorri
if
too
techi
for
ya
mg
similarli
one
can
not
plug
in
two
mb
simm
and
one
mb
simm
to
gi
mg
the
system
a
total
of
meg
whi
is
that
so
if
my
system
support
mg
of
meg
it
ha
simm
slot
can
i
plug
in
mb
simm
to
give
my
mg
mb
that
sound
correct
the
problem
is
that
if
your
comput
take
bit
wide
simm
you
can
not
mix
differ
size
in
one
bank
whi
you
ask
simpl
if
you
understand
whi
there
is
bank
assum
you
have
a
bit
cpu
dx
or
the
data
bu
eg
the
mechan
to
retriev
data
from
memori
is
bit
wide
so
the
comput
expect
to
see
bit
when
it
ask
for
data
to
get
that
bandwidth
bit
wide
the
motherboard
link
mx
one
bit
is
not
data
but
pariti
so
i
will
ignor
that
in
thi
simpl
explain
to
get
bit
bit
that
mean
that
a
simm
in
a
bank
store
onli
of
the
bit
wide
data
if
you
have
a
bit
bu
two
mx
simm
are
link
togeth
to
get
bit
wide
data
which
is
the
reason
whi
bank
are
simm
wide
and
bit
bank
are
simm
wide
if
your
comput
requir
mx
eg
bit
wide
data
with
pariti
bit
use
in
some
ps
and
ast
you
could
upgrad
by
one
simm
at
a
time
hope
that
thi
messag
is
not
over
your
head
but
the
answer
to
your
question
wa
not
simpl
i
could
of
just
said
becaus
