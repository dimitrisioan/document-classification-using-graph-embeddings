write
in
go
with
the
modern
trend
the
orchid
p
card
onli
support
color
in
x
mode
without
a
driver
of
cours
thi
break
ani
do
program
which
us
svga
mode
like
most
of
my
cdrom
thi
is
not
the
case
the
rom
on
the
p
support
vesa
mode
of
up
to
x
in
color
vesacompli
applic
should
have
no
troubl
set
these
mode
but
im
forward
your
post
to
our
softwar
group
just
in
case
cant
be
too
care
not
that
i
doubt
that
your
applic
are
fail
to
run
lot
of
stuff
depend
on
figur
out
which
exact
svga
theyr
look
at
and
dont
use
vesa
call
vesa
is
still
pretti
new
everi
new
chip
set
confus
them
the
support
resolut
realli
annoy
me
you
can
do
x
at
hz
if
you
tell
the
driver
you
have
an
nec
fg
they
onli
have
about
six
monitor
list
plu
gener
and
if
you
choos
gener
you
cant
get
ani
high
refresh
at
all
but
at
x
you
are
limit
to
hz
seem
to
me
that
the
hardwar
should
be
abl
to
support
the
bandwidth
if
it
can
do
hz
at
it
sure
should
be
abl
to
do
it
at
higher
vertic
resolut
wa
the
main
reason
i
bought
the
card
over
the
orchid
f
vlb
i
current
have
and
it
will
do
xx
hz
a
well
i
think
we
go
to
at
least
hz
at
xx
and
mayb
more
and
it
a
function
of
the
ramdac
speed
not
the
power
we
need
to
fix
the
problem
youv
note
they
were
alreadi
on
the
list
if
your
realli
interest
though
take
a
look
at
the
text
file
presdat
which
hold
the
data
from
which
the
choic
in
the
p
monitor
instal
program
are
built
work
by
analog
you
can
build
up
a
new
monitor
definit
that
ha
the
right
combin
of
refresh
rate
for
your
monitor
keep
a
backup
copi
of
the
file
onc
youv
built
a
new
version
of
the
presdat
file
run
the
p
instal
program
inst
and
your
new
choic
should
show
up
thi
assum
you
have
the
weitek
v
driver
you
can
tell
the
rev
number
by
look
at
the
modif
time
of
the
driver
is
version
microsoft
us
thi
gimmick
too
the
board
is
faster
that
the
ofvlb
for
most
thing
accord
to
the
hercul
speedi
program
thi
program
test
variou
oper
and
report
the
result
in
pixelssecond
i
dont
have
the
number
for
the
graphit
card
but
they
were
close
to
half
of
the
ofvlb
ie
slower
but
that
wa
run
in
a
mhz
isa
so
the
number
arent
realli
compar
the
follow
number
were
all
obtain
use
a
mhz
air
motherboard
umc
chipset
with
mb
memori
i
give
rang
becaus
the
program
report
the
number
a
it
comput
them
and
these
tend
to
jump
around
a
bit
the
speedi
benchmark
wa
put
out
by
hercul
and
iit
who
to
my
knowledg
were
unencumb
by
ani
motiv
except
make
the
hercul
graphiteiit
agx
card
look
realli
good
so
id
take
the
number
with
a
ton
of
salt
texa
instrument
did
the
same
thing
with
wintach
tri
to
make
the
look
good
compar
to
the
a
if
anyon
care
it
safer
though
not
safe
to
use
benchmark
from
unbias
sourc
such
a
test
lab
columnist
etc
interestingli
the
solid
vector
and
shade
polygon
show
no
improv
and
hatch
polygon
ie
fill
with
crosshatch
and
ternari
rop
whatev
they
are
graphic
oper
like
xor
mayb
are
a
dead
loss
on
the
i
think
youll
a
larg
discrep
between
the
result
of
speedi
and
the
result
of
anyth
els
in
the
univers
on
these
thing
i
give
two
number
for
the
font
becaus
i
think
they
are
cach
when
the
font
are
first
drawn
on
the
screen
they
are
done
fairli
slowli
the
speed
of
the
ofvlb
then
the
speed
increas
dramat
sound
like
program
to
a
benchmark
to
me
font
cach
is
a
perfectli
legitim
optim
window
ha
hook
for
it
built
right
into
the
gdi
what
kind
of
silli
is
iit
use
of
a
hardwir
the
quick
brown
fox
jump
over
the
lazi
dog
then
sat
on
a
tack
string
in
their
driver
not
onli
is
it
useless
in
real
applic
it
lack
the
program
eleg
of
the
bart
simpson
optim
in
which
you
save
the
bitmap
of
the
mostrec
drawn
string
in
offscreen
memori
and
just
do
a
screentoscreen
bitblit
if
you
happen
to
be
given
that
same
string
a
second
time
in
a
row
we
call
it
the
bart
simpson
optim
becaus
bart
the
onli
person
we
can
see
benefit
from
it
he
could
right
i
will
not
cheat
on
benchmark
a
hundr
time
and
be
done
in
half
the
time
it
would
take
to
actual
form
each
charact
i
make
no
claim
that
these
number
mean
anyth
at
all
it
just
what
i
saw
when
i
ran
them
on
my
comput
i
normal
dont
write
disclaim
but
thi
time
mayb
id
better
my
test
is
total
unconnect
with
my
work
i
program
under
unix
on
decstat
is
done
complet
without
the
knowledg
bless
or
