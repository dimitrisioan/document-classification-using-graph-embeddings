write
in

timothi
c
may
write
but
is
it
ani
wors
than
the
current
unsecur
system
it
becom
much
wors
of
cours
if
the
govern
then
use
thi
clinton
clipper
to
argu
for
restrict
on
unapprov
encrypt
thi
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
u
i
think
the
camel
nose
in
the
tent
etc
not
to
pick
on
mr
may
in
particular
of
cours
but
isnt
thi
kind
of
the
domino
theori
when
one
littl
countri
fall
it
neighbor
will
sure
follow
and
befor
you
know
it
were
all

in

for
not

in
our

crunch
secret
decod

i
wish
i
could
agre
with
you
ask
yourself
thi
whi
would
ani
privat
sector
entiti
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
wa
known
to
be
at
least
partial
compromis
key
escrow
in
thi
instanc
whi
would

entiti
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
had
not
been
properli
evalu
ie
algorythm
not
public
releas
the
answer
seem
obviou
to
me
they
wouldnt
there
is
other
hardwar
out
there
not
compromis
de
a
an
exampl
tripl
de
a
a
better
one
my
suspicion
is
that
the
price
will
drop
dramat
on
these
non
clipper
system
if
not
were
in
troubl
given
that
the
clinton
administr
is
not
entir
stupid
although
wed
like
to
think
so
i
can
not
believ
that
they
have
fail
to
realiz
thi
they
know
their
initi
will
fail
much
a
crippl
de
wa
never
taken
serious
the
onli
way
their
move
can
work
is
by
coercion
you
know
littl
about
polit
if
you
dont
realiz
that
thi
is
just
a
first
step
in
the
next
move
it
make
no
sen
otherwis
the
next
move
ban
or
severli
crippl
crypto
not
use
the
clipper
system
is
easili
justifi
whi
would
anyon
want
other
encrypt
unless
they
were
tri
to
subvert
the
govern
weve
provid
you
with
a
veri
secur
altern
so
use
it
or
go
to

finedwhatev
how
can
you
reconcil
the

self
proclaim

enforc
with

dont

short
they
cant
be
that
stupid
either
ban
non

crypto
is
the
next
answer
or
the

is
about
that
of

at

increas
lean
toward
a
authoritarian
approach
with

to
privaci

freedom
from

in

life
it
is
appar
to
me
that
those
who
draft
the

a
the

are
either
incred
ignor

veri

inde
anyon
knowledg
in
the
nuanc
of

develop

must
understand
that
a
key
step
in
the
develop
of
a
new
algorithm
especi
one
destin
for
standard
is
the
full
disclosur
of
the

to

the

dep

scrutini
by

onli
such
scrutini
can
provid

the
assumpt
that
a

will
be
accept

without
full

is
plain
ignor

that

such
a
de
when
it
is

escrow
is
lunaci
it
seem
an

step
in

no

can
not
believ
that
even

would
have
fail

these
flaw
i
can
onli
assum
then
that
the
drafter
of

the

even
the

of

make
it

clear
that
the

is
the
