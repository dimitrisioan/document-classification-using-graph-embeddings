what

there

three
answer
to

each
slightli
deeper
than

you

first
answer
in

book
name
a
frequenc
list
comput
directli
from

sampl
of

of

ani
such
list
will
be
correctli
comput
but
exactli
which
list
you
get
depend
on
which
sampl
wa
taken
the
second
answer
is
that
the
question
doesnt
make
sens
what
do
you
mean
by

letter
the
english
languag
is
not

that

author
ani

will

is
that
ye
no

the

for

these

what
the
chanc
that
a

with
these

frequenc
is

and
come
up
with

robust
answer
so
make
your
own
list
from
your

it
