see
i
am
kind
of
nervou
becaus
in
the
last
month
or
so
i
have
seen
a
nonstop
stream
of
idea
come
out
of
wash
dc
that
at
least
appear
veri
strongli
to
have
a
common
trait
to
limit
privaci
freedom
from
govt
eavesdrop
and
the
abil
to
defend
ourselv
against
violent
attack
no
is
not
good
enough
for
common
folk
they
arriv
onli
in
time
to
clean
up
the
mess
i
would
be
dead
if
i
had
to
depend
on
you
see
with
all
that
talk
about
nation
smart
id
card
limit
of
encrypt
to
govern
approv
denial
of
mean
to
effect
person
defens
eight
bill
in
congress
right
now
it
look
an
aw
lot
like
the
whole
thing
is
to
be
abl
to
trace
everi
activ
of
an
individu
from
cradl
to
grave
all
it
would
take
is
requir
that
nation
id
card
to
be
use
in
all
transact
and
with
no
effect
data
protect
and
with
the
peopl
suitabl
disarm
there
would
not
be
a
helluva
lot
they
could
do
about
it
now
would
there
all
in
the
name
of
the
war
on
the
constitu
er
drug
and
of
cours
that
catch
word
terrorist
what
is
wrong
with
good
oldfashion
polic
work
to
build
a
case
they
dont
want
to
have
to
be
burden
to
leav
the
offic
it
seem
pleas
read
the
bill
of
right
first
ten
amend
to
the
u
constitut
and
tell
u
how
you
can
reconcil
thi
big
brotherish
polici
of
the
administr
alway
for
a
crisi
of
some
kind
isnt
it
with
that
bill
of
right
in
the
context
of
the
peopl
who
wrote
it
reassur
u
pleas
or
is
that
no
longer
regard
a
necessari
see
a
apparantli
the
peopl
have
no
input
on
thi
agenda
the
administr
prefer
to
make
all
the
decis
in
secret
then
spring
it
on
u
doesnt
sound
much
like
by
the
peopl
to
me
i
can
not
help
notic
that
the
congress
peopl
involv
were
not
mention
on
the
press
releas
i
find
that
more
than
a
littl
bit
curiou
dont
you
i
sure
would
like
to
know
who
to
not
vote
for
come
elect
time
ye
i
am
upset
i
feel
you
are
a
part
of
thi
becaus
i
recal
it
wa
you
that
wa
post
heavili
in
favor
of
a
veri
similar
idea
could
have
been
the
same
thing
it
wa
so
close
a
few
month
ago
i
also
recal
it
wa
not
well
receiv
apparantli
powersthatb
realli
didnt
care
or
were
not
told
or
both
from
what
i
see
clipper
will
onli
be
use
for
convers
i
dont
want
the
neighborhood
kid
listen
in
on
ani
seriou
secur
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
trust
it
a
bit
might
a
well
use
cleartext
certainli
corpor
would
be
rather
dumb
to
depend
on
thi
for
seriou
tradesecret
data
especi
if
million
depend
on
that
secur
given
enough
money
one
could
buy
ani
key
they
want
buy
a
crook
judg
and
a
crook
cop
given
a
few
hundr
thou
they
wouldnt
be
hard
to
find
so
we
end
up
with
onli
crimin
terrorist
and
the
govern
with
real
secur
and
the
abil
to
eavesdrop
you
know
the
first
two
if
they
are
seriou
aint
go
to
use
thi
thing
for
their
commun
i
bet
the
govern
wont
either
except
perhap
to
order
a
pizza
tell
u
will
that
be
prima
face
evid
of
crimin
activ
someon
not
use
the
govern
approv
method
that
just
a
desir
to
have
privaci
is
no
longer
regard
a
a
legitim
right
of
an
unconnect
citizen
will
that
be
ground
for
a
flythroughthedoor
raid
and
confisc
of
all
one
equip
a
terrorist
tool
use
civil
forfeitur
so
there
will
be
no
inconveni
need
to
prove
ani
wrongdo
on
the
part
of
the
citizen
i
have
yet
anoth
question
are
we
go
to
see
articl
in
all
the
public
magazin
consist
of
sooth
text
tell
u
how
great
thi
is
how
nice
the
govern
is
by
let
u
have
thi
illus
of
privaci
that
the
govern
is
go
to
be
so
kind
a
to
let
u
sort
of
exercis
a
right
what
you
want
to
bet
that
i
am
correct
here
pleas
answer
these
question
a
citizen
of
the
unit
state
we
hava
a
right
to
know
what
our
govern
plan
to
let
u
have
out
of
the
good
of
their
heart
funni
thing
though
with
all
these
propos
i
dont
feel
one
bit
safer
from
drug
dealer
terrorist
or
a
common
street
thug
i
am
begin
to
wonder
if
the
greater
danger
lie
in
the
abov
entiti
or
our
own
govern
gone
out
of
control
reassur

pleas
