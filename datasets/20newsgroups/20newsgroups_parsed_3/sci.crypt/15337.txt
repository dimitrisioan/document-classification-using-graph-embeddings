clipper
chip
most
of
you
have
seen
the
announc
in
friday
ny
time
etc
about
nist
nation
institut
of
standard
technolog
announc
the
clipper
chip
crypto
devic
sever
messg
on
the
net
have
ask
for
more
technic
detail
and
some
have
been
labor
under
understand
misunderstand
given
the
lack
of
detail
in
the
news
articl
so
here
to
help
out
is
your
friendli
nsa
link
me
i
wa
somewhat
surpris
friday
to
get
a
call
from
the
agenc
which
suppli
mani
of
the
miss
detail
i
wa
told
the
info
wa
public
so
here
it
is
the
cc
of
thi
to
denni
branstad
at
nist
is
mostli
a
a
doubl
check
on
my
fact
sinc
i
assum
he
is
awar
of
all
thi
plea
let
me
know
if
i
have
anyth
wrong
the
clipper
chip
will
have
a
secret
crypto
algorithm
embed
in
silicon
each
chip
will
have
two
secret
bit
key
one
will
be
the
same
for
all
chip
ie
a
systemwid
key
and
the
other
will
be
unit
specif
i
dont
know
what
nist
and
nsa
will
call
them
but
i
will
call
them
the
system
key
sk
and
unit
key
uk
in
thi
messag
the
ic
will
be
design
to
be
extrem
difficult
to
revers
so
that
the
system
key
can
be
kept
secret
asid
it
is
clear
that
they
also
want
to
keep
the
algorithm
secret
and
in
my
opinion
it
may
be
a
much
for
that
a
thi
state
purpos
the
unit
key
will
be
gener
a
the
xor
of
two
bit
random
number
k
and
k
ukkk
which
will
be
kept
by
the
two
escrow
author
who
these
escrow
author
will
be
is
still
to
be
decid
by
the
attorney
gener
but
it
wa
stress
to
me
that
they
will
not
be
nsa
or
law
enforc
agenc
that
they
must
be
parti
accept
to
the
user
of
the
system
a
unbias
when
a
law
enforc
agenc
get
a
court
order
they
will
present
it
to
these
two
escrow
author
and
receiv
k
and
k
therebi
allow
access
to
the
unit
key
uk
in
addit
to
the
system
key
each
user
will
get
to
choos
hi
or
her
own
key
and
chang
it
a
often
a
desir
call
thi
key
plain
old
k
when
a
messag
is
to
be
sent
it
will
first
be
encrypt
under
k
then
k
will
be
encrypt
under
the
unit
key
uk
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
ad
to
produc
a
three
part
messag
which
will
then
be
encrypt
under
the
system
key
sk
produc
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
when
a
court
order
obtain
k
and
k
and
thenc
k
the
law
enforc
agenc
will
use
sk
to
decrypt
all
inform
flow
on
the
suspect
link
asid
it
is
my
guess
that
they
may
do
thi
constantli
on
all
link
with
or
without
a
court
order
sinc
it
is
almost
imposs
to
tell
which
link
over
which
a
messag
will
flow
thi
give
the
agenc
access
to
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
in
the
abov
messag
they
then
check
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
and
see
if
it
is
on
the
watch
list
for
which
they
have
a
court
order
if
so
they
will
decrypt
ek
uk
to
obtain
k
and
then
decrypt
em
k
to
obtain
m
i
am
still
in
the
process
of
ass
thi
scheme
so
plea
do
not
take
the
abov
a
ani
kind
of
endors
of
the
propos
scheme
all
i
am
tri
to
do
is
help
all
of
u
ass
the
scheme
more
knowledg
but
i
will
say
that
the
need
for
just
one
court
order
worri
me
i
would
feel
more
comfort
though
not
necessarili
comfort
if
two
separ
court
order
were
need
one
per
escrow
author
while
no
explan
is
need
the
follow
stori
add
some
color
in
research
some
idea
that
silvio
micali
and
i
have
been
kick
around
i
spoke
with
gerald
gunther
the
constitut
law
expert
here
at
stanford
and
he
relat
the
follow
stori
when
edward
levi
becam
pre
ford
attorney
gener
right
after
waterg
he
wa
visit
by
an
fbi
agent
ask
for
the
wiretap
author
when
levi
ask
for
the
detail
so
he
could
review
the
case
a
requir
by
law
the
agent
told
him
that
hi
predecessor
just
turn
over
blank
sign
form
everi
time
levi
did
not
compli
and
chang
the
system
but
the
lesson
is
clear
no
singl
person
or
author
should
have
the
power
to
author
wiretap
or
wors
yet
divulg
of
person
key
sometim
he
or
she
will
be
an

it
is
fine
to

key
a
she
wa
told
it
is
call
onli
encrypt
the
serial
number
or
the
serial
number
and
the
encrypt
unit
key
thi
is
