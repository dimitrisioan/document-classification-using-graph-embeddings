if
the

establish
a
cryptographi
standard
that
ha
to
be
use
by
everyon
and
everyon
person
key
is
divid
into
two
segment
and
store
at
two
separ
albeit
easi
to
find

and
that

is
onli
bit
to

screw
pardon
the

articl
the
gov
i
believ
a
do
mani
other
probabl
alreadi
have
the
crack
chip
for
thi
clipper
chip
made
hell
they
probabl
base
the
encod
on
the
chip
that
crack
it
that
way
it
easier
to
break
the
code
but
sinc
it
is
a
classifi
algorythm
no
one
know
that
they
can
crack
it
so
easili
agre
no
agenc
such
a
the
nsa
or
whoever
would
approv
the
public
releas
of
a
cryptosystem
if
they
didnt
alreadi
have
the
technic
mean
or
the
knowhow
to
decrypt
everyth
at
their
whim
sure
the
whole
point
of
all
thi
mad
is
to
make
joe
public
think
that
hisher
commun
will
be
kept
safe
while
jame
bond
at
the
nsa
can
if
need
be
have
full
decrypt
access
to
someon
commun
thatll
be
quit
a
heist
if
they
can
pull
it
off
i
thought
that
the
u
govern
were
go
to
releas
the
algorithm
to
a
panel
of
care
chosen
expert
who
would
then
studi
it
deepli
and
report
their
find

who
will
these

tinytoon
i
for
one
and
quit
scare
of
thi
kind
of
thing
and
plan
to
support
organ
and
even
disorgan
who
are
fight
against
thi
clipper
chip
in
ani
way
that
i
can
i
can
onli
hope
that
the
same
sort
of
thing
doesnt
start
filter
over
into
the
ear
of
the
uk
govern
and
if
the
european
parliament
get
wind
of
it
well
we
can
kiss
goodby
to
ani
form
of
democraci
in

at
all
i
do
not
want
the
govern
to
be
abl
to
have
access
even
with
a
search
warrant
to
my
key
and
i
dont
want
