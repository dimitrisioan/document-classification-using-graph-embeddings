what
is
a
oneway
hash
function
what
is
the
differ

public
privat
secret

what
are
md
and

what
is
snefru
what
is
a
oneway
hash
function
a
typic
oneway
hash
function
take
a
variablelength
messag
and
produc
a
fixedlength
hash
given
the
hash
it
is
comput
imposs
to
find
a
messag
with
that
hash
in
fact
one
cant
determin
ani
usabl
inform
about
a
messag
with
that
hash
not
even
a
singl
bit
for
some
oneway
hash
function
it
also
comput
imposs
to
determin
two
messag
which
produc
the
same
hash
a
oneway
hash
function
can
be
privat
or
public
just
like
an
encrypt
function
here
one
applic
of
a
public
oneway
hash
function
like
md
or
snefru
most
publickey
signatur
system
are
rel
slow
to
sign
a
long
messag
may
take
longer
than
the
user
is
will
to
wait
solut
comput
the
oneway
hash
of
the
messag
and
sign
the
hash
which
is
short
now
anyon
who
want
to
verifi
the
signatur
can
do
the
same
thing
anoth
name
for
oneway
hash
function
is
messag
digest
function
what
is
the
differ
between
public
privat
secret
share
etc
there
is
a
horrend
mishmash
of
terminolog
in
the
literatur
for
a
veri
small
set
of
concept
when
an
algorithm
depend
on
a
key
which
isnt
publish
we
call
it
a
privat
algorithm
otherwis
we
call
it
a
public
algorithm
we
have
encrypt
function
e
and
decrypt
function
d
so
that
dem
m
for
ani
messag
m
we
also
have
hash
function
h
and
verif
function
v
such
that
vmx
if
and
onli
if
x
hm
a
publickey
cryptosystem
ha
public
encrypt
and
privat
decrypt
checksum
such
a
the
applic
mention
in
the
previou
question
have
public
hash
and
public
verif
digit
signatur
function
have
privat
hash
and
public
verif
onli
one
person
can
produc
the
hash
for
a
messag
but
everyon
can
verifi
that
the
hash
is
correct
obvious
when
an
algorithm
depend
on
a
privat
key
it
meant
to
be
unus
by
anyon
who
doesnt
have
the
key
there
no
real
differ
between
a
share
key
and
a
privat
key
a
share
key
isnt
publish
so
it
privat
if
you
encrypt
data
for
a
friend
rather
than
for
your
eye
onli
are
you
suddenli
do
sharedkey
