some
new
thought
id
despar
prefer
it
if
we
didnt
rehash
the
same
argument
that
went
on
ad
infinitum
last
time
that
especi
true
for
scicrypt
for
that
matter
ive
creat
altprivacyclipp
sinc
the
traffic
is
appear
in
mani
differ
group
right
now
im
go
to
focu
here
on
some
technic
aspect
of
the
plan
henc
my
followup
to
scicrypt
frankli
if
your
not
an
absolutist
your
feel
may
turn
on
some
of
these
issu
for
exampl
with
an
bit
key
simpli
split
it
into
two
bit
piec
is
much
le
accept
than
other
scheme
becaus
it
mean
that
if
just
one
repositori
is
shall
we
say
overli
pliabl
a
wouldb
eavesdropp
would
need
to
recov
just
more
bit
of
key
i
need
not
point
out
in
thi
newsgroup
that
that
pretti
easi
to
do
by
exhaust
search
a
slightli
more
complex
scheme
xore
the
key
with
a
random
number
and
then
with
it
complement
would
produc
two
bit
subkey
neither
of
which
is
use
alon
that
variant
is
much
more
resist
to
attack
clearli
one
can
get
even
more
sophist
to
protect
the
subkey
even
more
other
thought
some
peopl
have
note
the
size
and
complex
of
the
databas
necessari
but
the
id
string
the
phone
emit
could
be
their
back
door
key
doubleencrypt
with
the
escrow
repositori
public
key
for
that
matter
they
could
do
that
onli
with
session
key
and
have
no
back
door
at
all
in
that
case
the
fbi
would
have
to
bring
everi
intercept
to
the
repositori
to
be
decrypt
thi
would
answer
mani
of
the
object
along
the
line
of
how
do
you
make
sure
they
stop
we
can
even
combin
that
with
a
variant
of
the
digit
telephoni
back
door
have
the
switch
do
the
tap
but
with
a
digitallysign
record
of
the
time
phone
number
etc
of
the
call
that
provid
proof
to
the
escrow
agent
that
the
tap
wa
done
in
complianc
with
the
term
of
the
warrant
i
can
suggest
other
variat
too
suppos
each
clipper
chip
had
public
key
pair
each
would
be
use
time
after
which
youd
need
more
key
materi
not
a
bad
idea
in
ani
event
thi
could
be
use
to
enforc
time
limit
or
rather
usag
limit
on
each
warrant
the
key
the
repositori
agent
would
deliv
wouldnt
last
for
veri
long
i
suspect
that
the
cryptograph
algorithm
itself
is
secur
apart
from
the
obviou
whi
push
a
weak
algorithm
when
youv
alreadi
got
the
back
door
i
think
that
the
govern
is
still
genuin
concern
about
foreign
espionag
especi
aim
at
commerci
target
thi
scheme
let
the
spook
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too
ive
heard
rumor
over
the
year
that
some
faction
within
nsa
were
unhappi
with
de
becaus
it
wa
too
good
not
that
they
couldnt
crack
it
but
it
wa
much
too
expens
to
do
so
a
easili
a
theyd
want
theyr
keep
the
detail
secret
so
that
other
dont
build
their
own
implement
without
the
back
door
the
cryptograph
protocol
though
is
anoth
matter
i
see
no
valid
reason
for
keep
it
secret
and
a
i
hope
ive
shown
abov
there
are
a
lot
of
way
to
do
thing
that
arent
quit
a
bad
