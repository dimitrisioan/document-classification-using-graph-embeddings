so
is
tantamount

accept

is
blatantli
unconstitut
perhap
we
should
renam
thi

in
honor
of
such
an
illustri

let
the
crappi

live
in
infami

the

receiv
great
shame
and
discredit
for
thi
bizarr
misadventur
i
am
outrag
that
my
tax
money
is
be
use
to
develop

to
restrict
my

far
beyond

the

will
have
my
full
uncooper

disobedi
on

such
a
thi
and
i
call
on
everyon
with
an
interest
in
a

govern
to
resist

defi
thi

the
administr
doe
not
seem
to

that
they
are
mere
a
subservi
instrument
to
implement
the

of

henc
anyon

it
also
can
be
use
by
terrorist
drug

it
seem
to
me
that

diplomat
commun
should
be
tappabl
by

produc
a

for

these

violat
the

i
hope
mr

is
shrewd
enough
to
recogn

sarcasm
and
satir
here
but
if
he
isnt
it
a
modest
