somewher
perhap
a

of

i
got
wa
that
real
judg
would
dismiss
argument
that
thi
password
is
selfincrimin
a
firstyear

sophistri
the
fact
that
you
use
a
statement
for
a
password
ha
no
bear
on
the
verac
of
that
phrase
you
are
not
be
ask
to
incrimid
yourself
eg
where
did
you
buri
the
bodi
you
are
be
ask
to
provid
inform
necessari
to
execut
a
legal
search
warrant
refus
to
provid
the
password
is
akin
to
refus
to
provid
a
key
to
a
storag
locker
except
that
they
could
alway
forc
their
way
into
the
locker
of
cours
that
doesnt
mean
you
have
to
help
them
understand
what
they
find
or
point
out
thing
they
overlook
in
their
search
bear
