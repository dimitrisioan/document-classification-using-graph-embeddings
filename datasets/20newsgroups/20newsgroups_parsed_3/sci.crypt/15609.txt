chang
or
input
chang
if
they
were
out
to
build
a
weak
cryptosystem
it
might
be
the
case
that
some
of
the

are
much
le

than
other
in
the

that
they
onli
enter

appear
a

though
i
dont

nsa
is
go

that
crude
theyr
like
to
get

rememb
that
theyv
promis
to
let
a

see

cryptosystem
design
if
you
assum
someth
deslik
a
bias
subkey
gener
schedul
will
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
the
committe
can
and
should
run
lot
of
test
and
retain
the
output
thi
can
be
verifi
later
against
the
chip
and
ye
the
civilian
commun
ha
at
least
some
secur
storag
facil
that
i
dont

even
nsa
can
get

be
notic
until
fort
mead
get

transport
work
again
oop
i
dont
think
i
wa
suppos
to
talk
about
that
the
committe
member
can
even
retain
secur
copi
of
the
code
in
two
half
which
you
have
to
xor
togeth
to
recov
the
program
serious
there
are
i
think
problem
with
thi
whole
scheme
but
the
peopl
who
invent
it
arent
stupid
and
theyv
been
in
the
crypto
game
and
the
smokeandmirror
game
far
longer
than
most
of
u
theyr
not
go
to
lie
in
way
that
can
be
detect
easili
sinc
their
credibl
is
the
onli
thing
they
can
use
to
sell
thi
system
if
theyv
lie
about
the
civilian
committe
no
one
will
believ
them
about
the
absenc
of
other
back
door
if
theyv
lie
about
the
key
size
no
one
will
believ
that
they
havent
copi
the
program
disk
with
the
u
key
if
theyv
lie
about
obviou
aspect
of
the
strength
of
the
cryptosystem
no
one
will
believ
the
escrow
agenc
arent
in
cahoot
with
them
that
isnt
to
say
that
they
arent
lie
about
all
those
other
thing
anyway
and
im
certainli
not
claim
that
nsa
cant
build
a
cryptosystem
with
a
back
door
that
the
committe
cant
find
look
how
long
it
took
for
folk
to
believ
that
the
sbox
werent
sabotag
it
entir
possibl
that
the
committe
will
releas
an
ambigu
report
for
just
such
reason
but
that
a
subtl
point
ie
one
you
cant
explain
to
a
senat
anyway
it
look
like
the
key
and
escrow
arrang
are
smoke
and
mirror
to
cover
the
way
the
nsa
can
regener
the
key
from
the
transmit
serial
number
i
dont
like
the
unit
key
gener
process
ani
better
than
you
do
howev
s
and
s
are
suppos
to
be
under

of
the

if
they
