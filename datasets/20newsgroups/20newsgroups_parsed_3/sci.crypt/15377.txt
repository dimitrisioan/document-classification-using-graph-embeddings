whi

in
john
r
levin
write
quot
someon
els
here
the
cryptograph
protocol
though
is
anoth
matter
i
see
no
valid
reason
for
keep
it
secret
and
a
i
hope
ive
shown
abov
there
are
a
lot
of
way
to
do
thing
that
arent
quit
a
bad
it
just
occur
to
me
whi
the
algorithm
is
secret
if
it
were
publish
one
could
then
build
physic
ident
clone
version
of
the
chip
that
would
interoper
with
offici
clipper
chip
but
the
cloner
wouldnt
provid
the
key
to
the
escrow
hous
hmmn
yeah
the
algorithm
is
classifi
becaus
a
militari
contract
or
similar
govern
equival
to
militari
ha
been
let
for
thi
proprietari
design
that
the
fed
say
that
nsa
develop
is
there
a
patent
is
that
patent
publicli
avail
my
bet
is
that
that
too
is
classifi
if
the
algorithm
were
made
public
or
reverseengin
it
would
compromis
not
onli
the
goal
of
justic
of
be
abl
to
read
everi
chip
user
cyptodata
but
would
reduc
profit
for
the
select
chip
maker
wouldnt
that
just
be
too
bad
