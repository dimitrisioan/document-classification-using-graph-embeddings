compress
code
actual
doe
get

a
simdgen
left
over
thi
is
definit
worth
work
on
folk
and
shorten
work
in
well
under
realtim
i
dont
think
that
thi
should
be
work
on
just
in
the
context
of
cryptographi
that
sure
to
pose
all
sort
of
problem
for
all
sort
of
peopl
what
need
is
for
someon
to
develop
a
portabl
telephon
qualiti
speechr
convert
imagin
if
you
will
a
littl
box
that
take
data
on
it
serial
port
and
put
out
sound
and
take
sound
and
code
it
to
signal
on
it
serial
port
full
duplex
now
thi
devic
is
not
a
cryptograph
devic
it
a
portabl
poor

blaster
or
whatev
you
want

need
of
these
talki
box
and
a

and
some
kind
of
cutout
to
switch
over
and
some
code
on
say
a

id
realli
like
to
see
such

develop
so
that
interact
internet
talk
radio
could
be
done
ideal
though
it
should
be
a
gener
purpos
devic
it
should
be
a

purpos
enough
devic
that
nobodi
should
be
abl
to
balk
at
it
widespread
use
obvious
to
make
it
easi
for

it
should
use
pretti
common

to
track
down
a
coupl
of
