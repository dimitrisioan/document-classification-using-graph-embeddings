it
would
seem
that
the
one
fact
that
the
govern
ha
overlook
in
thi
whole
fiasco
is
the
econom
standpoint
a
other
have
mention
the
most
difficulti
the
clipper
chip
face
is
an
econom
one
let
face
it
the
averag
consum
doesnt
care
or
know
that
the
clipper
is
a
bad
idea
if
there
is
a
perceiv
need
for
cellular
encrypt
then
the
compani
will
provid
one
most
like
a
standard
will
emerg
but
if
the
clipper
is
too
expens
and
a
chip
is
way
too
much
then
they
will
develop
their
own
or
buy
a
cheaper
one
thi
is
an
interest
point
a
a
veri
coars
rule
of
thumb
you
can
figur
that
the
final
price
of
a
product
is
to
time
the
cost
of

those
that

will
be
at

i
suspect

in
the
middl
thi

would
increas
the
