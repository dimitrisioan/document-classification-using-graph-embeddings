write
q
suppos
a

enforc
agenc
is
conduct
a
wiretap
on
a

smuggl
ring
and
intercept
a

etc
great
nice
choic
of
bad
guy
to
convinc
everyon
how
bad
unrestrict
encrypt
is
whi
not
use
a
child
molest
instead
of
cours
the
word
suspect
is
never
use
here
so
i
guess
these
peopl
have
alreadi
been
convict
and
are
oper
thi
drug
ring
from
their
jail
cell
how
about
thi
question
instead
q
suppos
a
law
enforc
agenc
is
conduct
a
wiretap
on
a
polit
oppon
of
a
senior
administr
offici
and
intercept
a
convers
kinda
chang
your
interpret
of
the
event
doesnt
it
and
ye
the
presenc
of
the
clipper
chip
doe
chang
thing
becaus
it
will
not
onli
give
the
peopl
talk
on
the
phone
a
fals
sens
of
secur
it
will
also
give
feder
law
enforc
agenc
the
justif
to
deni
use
of
strong
encrypt
method
that
are
inconveni
to
them
dang
it
all
it
suppos
to
be
inconveni
but
not
imposs
that
the
onli
sure
way
to
make
sure
that
abus
are
minim
while
still
allow
legitim
law
enforc
access
q
how
strong
is
the
secur
in
the
devic
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
secur
is
a
thi
system
is
more
secur
than
mani
other
voic
encrypt
system
readili
avail
today
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classifi
to
protect
the
secur
of
the
key
escrow
system
we
are
will
to
invit
an
independ
panel
of
cryptographi
expert
to
evalu
the
algorithm
to
assur
all
potenti
user
that
there
are
no
unrecogn
vulner
uh
huh
sure
i
predict
that
within
two
month
week
of
the
chip
debut
the
full
technic
detail
will
be
post
to
scicrypt
and
if
thi
ha
ani
impact
on
the
secur
of
the
key
escrow
system
then
weve
been
lie
to
ani
cryptosystem
worth
it
salt
can
withstand
the
light
of
public
scrutini
and
there
is
no
way
you
can
be
sure
that
an
algorithm
ha
no
unrecogn
vulner
unless
you
have
half
the
world
tri
to
break
it
for
a
decad
or
so
even
then
you
got
ta
be
care
michael
t
palmer
a
man
is
crazi
who
write
a
