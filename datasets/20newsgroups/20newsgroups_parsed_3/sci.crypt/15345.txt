can
probabl
with
some
effort
abus
the
system
i
got
news
for
you
if
the
evil
guy
in
the
fbi
decid
they
want
to
persecut
you
theyr
gon
na
and
if
richard
nixon
had
had
thi
kind
of
toy
he
wouldnt
have
had
to
send
peopl
into
the
waterg
thi
appear
to
be
gener
call
upon
the
name
of
the
antichrist
just
for
the
hell
of
it
let
destroy
thi
remark
let
u
imagin
that
the
execut
branch
actual
could
extract
key
from
the
escrow
hous
without
anyon
know
or
tell
now
what
dick
ha
bit
of
data
what
the
hell
he
gon
na
do
with
it
trot
around
to
the
telco
and
say
wed
like
an
unauthoris
decrypt
tap
uh
huh
break
in
to
waterg
and
instal
hi
own
tap
so
hi
peopl
still
do
have
to
break
in
neat
huh
record
some
nois
then
get
the
execut
branch
phone
decrypt
box
huh
theyv
got
one
good
wait
til
the
washington
post
get
hold
of
thi
and
decrypt
the
nois
more
like
stare
at
the
key
and
say
oh
hell
it
not
worth
all
thi
bloodi
hassl
truth
is
even
grant
lot
of
covert
power
on
the
part
of
the
execut
branch
thi
system
is
more
difficult
to
tap
with
than
pot
gear
the
fact
that
it
is
easier
to
tap
than
some
hypothet
system
neither
you
nor
i
am
go
to
place
on
our
phone
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
onli
ration
concern
i
am
see
rais
are
a
is
the
key
realli
just
chop
in
half
and
not
some
xor
arrang
that
is
ha
some
egregi
technic
error
been
built
in
to
the
plan
b
is
thi
is
the
first
step
toward
strict
regul
of
strong
encrypt
but
that
not
realli
the
issu
the
real
issu
is
whether
thi
will
be
use
to
justifi
a
ban
against
individu
use
of
privat
ie
anyth
els
encrypt
method
thi
is
b
of
cours
i
suspect
not
if
the
govern
actual
want
to
make
such
reg
theyd
just
do
it
a
few
hundr
peopl
on
usenet
yell
about
it
wouldnt
even
slow
the
machin
down
besid
who
is
thi
mysteri
they
who
go
to
take
away
all
our
right
the
instant
we
let
our
guard
down
congress
that
gang
of
buffoon
cant
even
balanc
their
checkbook
the
fbi
but
they
dont
make
the
law
the
nsa
ditto
the
white
hous
bill
clinton
is
probabl
still
look
for
the
bathroom
it
a
big
