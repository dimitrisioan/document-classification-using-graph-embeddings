for

befor
you
post

it
youll
be
amaz
how
often
the

question
can
be
ask
in

after
a
month
youll
have
a
much
better
sen
of
what
the
reader
want
to
see
do

belong
in
scicrypt
no
in
fact
some

notabl

so
that
polit
question
like

be

dont

question
about
microfilm

and
other
noncryptograph
spi
stuff
dont
belong
in
scicrypt
either
how
do
i
present
a
new
encrypt
scheme
in
scicrypt
i
just
came
up
with
thi
neat
method
of
encrypt
here
some
ciphertext
is
it
strong
without
a
doubt
question
like
thi
are
the
most
annoy
traffic
on
scicrypt
if
you
have
come
up
with
an
encrypt
scheme
provid
some
ciphertext
from
it
is
not
adequ
nobodi
ha
ever
been
impress
by
random
gibberish
ani
new
algorithm
should
be
secur
even
if
the
oppon
know
the
full
algorithm
includ
how
ani
messag
key
is
distribut
and
onli
the
privat
key
is
kept
secret
there
are
some
systemat
and
unsystemat
way
to
take
reason
long
ciphertext
and
decrypt
them
even
without
prior
knowledg
of
the
algorithm
but
thi
is
a
timeconsum
and
possibl
fruitless
exercis
which
most
scicrypt
reader
wont
bother
with
so
what
do
you
do
if
you
have
a
new
encrypt
scheme
first
of
all
find
out
if
it
realli
new
look
through
thi

for

relat
method
familiar
yourself
with
the

and
the
introductori
textbook
when
you
can
appreci
how
your
cryptosystem
fit
into
the
world
at
larg
tri
to
break
it
yourself
you
shouldnt
wast
the
time
of
ten
of
thousand
of
reader
ask
a
question
which
you
could
have
easili
answer
on
your
own
if
you
realli
think
your
system
is
secur
and
you
want
to
get

you
might
tri

it
your
respons

rather
than

layer
of

and
come
back
for

round
a
differ
way
to

review
is
to

a

is
outsid

among

a
common
rule
of
thumb
is
that
if

you
have
