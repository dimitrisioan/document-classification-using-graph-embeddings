i
think
thi
is

it
come
from
the

philosophi
that
the

rulescontrol
the
peopl
not
the
peopl
control
the
govern
that
the
unconnect
citizen
are
not
sophist
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
them
so
the
govern
must
tell
the
peopl
what
they
need
or
do
not
need
we
know
best
and
the
idea
that
that
a
common
can
defend
himself
against
govern
eavesdrop
or
unlaw
attack
is
total
unaccept

and
with
you

more

yet
to

so
what
if
will
be
ten
year
late
it
still
is
turn
out
to
be
an
amazingli
accur
propheci
unless
a
lot
of

wake
up

in

one
should
alway
have
everi
red
warn

come
up
when
the

seek
to
set
itself
apart
in

from

or
should
we
now
be

instead
whi
shouldnt
the
averag

have
a
good
secur
system
of

secur
not
depend
on

safeguard
for
maintain
that
secur
whi
shouldnt
the
averag

be
abl
to
defend
himself
from
an
agenc
gone
rogu
i
am
sure
the
fed
could
break
into
ani
data
they
realli
want
to
but
it
would
take
some
work
and
use
the
same
logic
one
should
not
be
allow
to
have
a
good
safe
unless
a
duplic
of
the
key
or
combin
are
submit
for

by

i
dont
realli
see

philosoph
encrypt
data
sure
wont
evapor
not
with
such
hightech
tool
a
a
tape
record
the
averag
amerikan
today
seem
to
think
that
the
govern
should
be
abl
to
eavesdrop
on
everyon
el
opinion
poll
show
that
most
peopl
beliv
the
bill
of
right
to
grant
too
much
freedom
to
peopl
when
it
is
not
identifi
a
such
btw
if
anyon
know
of
a
cite
for
that
id
love
to
have
it
not
onli
doe
thi
mean
that
these
peopl
are
will
to
give
up
everyon
el
right
they
dont
even
know
what
the
bill
of
right
actual
say
how
can
we
show
the
averag
person
not
the
averag
usenet
reader
that
peopl
are
actual
entitil
to
these
right
so
mani
peopl
dont
care
if
the
govern
is
take
more
and
more
control
of
u
all
a
littl
at
a
time
if
there
wa
some
sort
of
awar
of
what
the
govern
is
tri
to
do
by
a
major
of
the
u
popul
just
think
about
what
could
be
accomplish
but
there
are
so
mani
that
trust
unthinkingli
in
whatev
the
medium
and
govern
tell
them
