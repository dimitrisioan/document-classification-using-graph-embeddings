steven
bellovin
write
there
are
three
issu
with
clipper
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
architectur
of
the
whole
scheme
is
capabl
of
work
my
answer
with
one
signific
except
is
ye
i
realli
do
think
that
nsa
and
nist
have
design
thi
scheme
about
a
well
a
can
be
assum
that
their
real
object
are
a
state
to
permit
wiretap
under
certain
carefullycontrol
circumst
with
a
minimum
risk
of
abus
the
except
is
that
u
exist
outsid
of
the
chip
on
a
program
diskett
that
serious
wrong
u
and
u
should
be
load
onto
the
chip
separ
to
those
who
disagre
and
i
dont
claim
my
answer
is
obviou
though
i
found
my
own
reason
suffici
persuas
that
i
wa
forc
to
rewrit
the
conclus
section
of
my
technic
analysi
paper
i
had
origin
blast
the
scheme
i
issu
thi
invit
assum
that
you
were
charg
with
implement
such
a
system
with
complet
regard
for
civil
right
and
due
process
what
would
you
do
differ
in
answer
thi
question
plea
accept
nsa
fundament
assumpt
that
both
strong
cryptographi
against
outsid
and
the
abil
to
wiretap
some
domest
user
is
necessari
if
you
feel
it
necessari
to
challeng
those
assumpt
do
it
in
the
context
of
the
last
issu
i
present
below
right
here
im
discus
just
the
technic
aspect
and
no
i
dont
by
ani
mean
claim
that
just
becaus
someth
can
be
done
it
should
be
ok
