subject
re
my
letter
about
clipper
in
articl
david
sternlight
write
part
of
the
basi
for
my
belief
is
that
we
nsa
have
more
peopl
spend
much
more
money
and
have
much
better
hardwar
than
anyon
el
the
same
could
be
said
for
mani
other
gover
agenc
but
big
budget
larg
staff
and
long
lead
time
havent
made
mani
of
them
into
model
of
effect
the
fact
is
that
those
of
u
outsid
the
inner
circl
have
onli
jame
bamford
word
that
the
peopl
at
the
nsa
use
those
legendari
mass
of
comput
for
anyth
other
than
read
netnew
like
mani
of
u
the
nsa
doesnt
have
an
impress
record
of
accomplish
at
least
not
a
public
record
david
sternlight
great
care
ha
been
taken
to
ensur
the
accuraci
of
our
inform
error
and
omiss
except

is
priceless
where
