write

whi
is
that
i
doubt
there
is
a
trapdoor
in
skipjack
but
we
will
never
know
and
i
doubt
the
nsa
would
promot
a
mass

chip
they
couldnt
compromis
ergo
nsa
is
now
capabl

with

engin
of
the
complex
of
skipjack
look
at
the
spec
whi
i
bet
they
have
thousand
of
littl
chip
chug
away
in
their
crypto
buster
mayb
even
ten
of

complex
not
much
more
than
a

such

will
fit

i

million

that
trial
per

or
about
year
for

well
mayb
they
can
get
chip
run
at
one

and
build
a

sure
onli

use

shall
i
bother
do

you
cant
do
idea
at
that
speed
key
setup
take
much
too
long
i
wouldnt
be
surpris
if
that
were
the
case
for
skipjack
too
though
there
no

of

just
yet
de

becaus
that
what

with

can

nsa
may
or
may
not
know
how
to
crack

and

i

it
for

i
have
no

though
it
doe
