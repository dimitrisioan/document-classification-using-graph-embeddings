carl

write
clipper
might
be
a
good
way
to
cover
the
use
of
anoth
layer
of
encrypt
but
if
you
are
make
custom
equip
in
ani
case
whi
not
just
roll
your
own
clipper
implement
and
report
the
wrong
key
to
the
escrow
agenc
tell
u
who
is
go
to
be
in
the
chip
busi
if
thi
thing
goe
throughnsa
and
those
with
someth
to
hide
from
nsa
if
anyon
can
verifi
that
your
phone
is
not
use
the
key
regist
to
that
serial
number
either
they
have
a
court
order
wiretap
but
what
are
they
go
to
do
tell
the
judg
that
thi
individu
realli
doe
have
privaci
all
they
know
is
that
the
key
are
not
enough
but
not
whi
they
have
a
court
order
wiretap
on
a
phone
in
thi
seri
thi
part
is
realli
scari
sinc
the
expect
is
that
all
chip
in
a
particular
batch
will
use
seed
base
on
the
same
s
and
s
and
the
serial
number
get
the
key
for
one
of
a
batch
may
give
access
to
all
there
is
a
backdoor
which
allow
all
messag
to
be
deciph
without
the
key
i
find
thi
one
especi
threaten
sinc
the
scheme
seem
veri
open
to
known
plaintext
attack
what
i
need
to
deciph
is
the
data
in
the
header
if
i
talk
to
someon
who
ha
one
of
these
phone
presum
there
will
be
an
automat
negoti
key
gener
im
not
tri
to
deciph
the
record
of
the
convers
to
know
what
wa
said
i
use
it
a
a
known
plaintext
to
recov
the
backdoor
repres
by
the
header
but
i
know
what
the
header
say
for
convers
i
particip
in
even
wors
if
the
phone
in
a
seri
have
relat
key
i
can
buy
a
phonechip
from
the
same
product
lot
then
i
can
recov
it
key
either
elegantli
by
talk
to
myself
or
by
brute
forc
analysi
of
the
actual
chip
then
appli
the
key
gener
process
with
those
seed
to
find
the
target
key
hmmm
i
dont
think
i
want
to
ever
come
close
to
these
phone
even
de
is
start
to
look
good
two
can
and
a
