i
work
for
previous
i
receiv
a
file
that
wa
de
encryp
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
week
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
onli
took
two
day
to
crack
the
file
take
thi
at
face
valu
though
it
seem
quit
disson
with
much
els
that
ha
been
publish
here
about
brute
forc
de
crack
unless
russel
wa
lucki
with
respect
to
the
key
id
be
veri
interest
in
whether
the
program
russel
use
is
avail
in
whether
he
use
a
cleartext
recognit
algorithm
in
the
program
or
whether
he
had
to
examin
each
decrypt
by
hand
in
whether
he
use
a
known
plaintext
attack
thi
ha
to
be
a
dictionari
attack
no
other
attack
make
sens
thi
mean
that
whoever
encrypt
the
file
just
type
some
password
which
wa
a
singl
dictionari
word
and
then
russel
tri
all
the
word
in
the
dictionari
thi
isnt
too
implaus
especi
if
he
wa
smart
and
clip
the
first
plaintext
block
off
the
ciphertext
if
the
first
block
doesnt
decrypt
then
obvious
the
other
wont
either
assum
one
attempt
a
second
it
take
seven
hour
to
tri
all
the
word
in
usrdictword
not
real
tough
if
you
want
de
to
be
secur
you
have
to
use
random
key
you
cant
just
type
your
wife
