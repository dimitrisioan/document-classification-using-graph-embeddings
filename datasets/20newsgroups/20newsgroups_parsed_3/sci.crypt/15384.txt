re
whi
the
clipper
algorithm
is
secret
john
r
levin
write
the
cryptograph
protocol
though
is
anoth
matter
i
see
no
valid
reason
for
keep
it
secret
and
a
i
hope
ive
shown
abov
there
it
just
occur
to
me
whi
the
algorithm
is
secret
if
it
were
publish
one
could
then
build
physic
ident
clone
version
i
recal
see
a
post
some
time
ago
say
that
if
the
detail
of
an
encrypt
scheme
couldnt
be
reveal
then
the
encrypt
scheme
is
worthless
i
believ
the
statement
wa
in
respons
to
somebodi
say
that
they
had
some
new
snazzi
scheme
but
the
algorithm
wa
a
secret
doe
thi
algorithm
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
scheme
is
secret
or
is
it
for
the
state
reason
