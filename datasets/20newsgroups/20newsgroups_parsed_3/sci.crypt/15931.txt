might
be
abl
to
give

troubl
didnt

think
about
thi
or
is
it
a
featur
and
they
thought
we
wouldnt
notic
i
would
have
thought
that
by
now
they
would
have
respond
with
someth
of
the
form
well
that
wont
be
a
problem
becaus
don
alvarez
post
a
good
partial
solut
to
thi
problem
to
comprisk
ill
present
my
variant
on
it
instead
sinc
i
feel
it
a
bit
stronger
against
some
like
attempt
to
cheat
depend
on
the
protocol
that
follow
for
read
traffic
briefli
the
cop
get
a
wiretap
warrant
and
record
the
call
they
then
notic
the
encrypt
and
the
disclosur
header
it
along
with
a
copi
of
their
warrant
is
sent
to
the
fbi
or
whoever
it
is
who
hold
the
famili
key
the
fholder
decrypt
the
header
and
send
the
serial
number
n
and
the
encrypt
session
key
uk
to
the
escrow
agent
they
in
turn
use
u
and
u
to
recov
k
and
send
that
to
the
local
polic
note
how
thi
solv
the
problem
of
wiretap
forev
neither
the
cop
nor
the
fbi
ever
see
u
so
they
cant
read
other
traffic
everi
request
must
be
valid
by
both
the
fbi
and
the
escrow
agent
the
cop
and
the
fbi
togeth
cant
cheat
sinc
they
dont
have
u
i
regard
that
a
a
like
pair
of
folk
who
might
tri
to
beat
the
system
it
to
prevent
thi
that
i
modifi
alvarez
scheme
the
escrow
agent
cant
read
the
convers
sinc
they
dont
have
it
all
they
have
is
n
and
uk
and
the
polic
dont
even
see
n
it
harder
to
see
how
to
block
decrypt
of
old
warrantless
wiretap
there
is
one
protect
you
have
to
persuad
the
escrow
agent
that
the
call
is
current
but
that
not
nearli
a
strong
there
are
approach
i
can
see
that
might
work
involv
sequenc
of
data
on
an
unalter
medium
complet
with
cryptograph
protect
against
insert
onto
a
new
medium
but
i
dont
have
anyth
yet
that
isnt
too
complex
for
comfort
or
too
hard
to
instal
in
the
real
world
the
nsa
might
have
an
answer
they
may
or
may
not
be
smarter
than
me
but
ive
been
work
on
thi
for
a
week
and
theyv
had
year
