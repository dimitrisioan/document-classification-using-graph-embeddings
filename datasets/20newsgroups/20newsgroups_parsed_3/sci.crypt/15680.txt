subject
re
secret
algorithm
re
clipper
chip
and
crypto
keyescrow
after
read
the
debat
over
the
clipper
i
have
a
few
thing
to
add
first
most
of
the
peopl
i
know
who
activli
use
encrypt
privat
do
not
care
about
most
of
the
issu
that
surround
thi
debat
and
ani
question
about
what
is
or
is
not
ok
to
use
in
the
u
all
they
care
about
is
wether
or
not
what
they
are
use
is
secur
or
not
that
after
all
is
the
bottom
line
second
if
i
look
at
all
the
peopl
i
know
who
use
ani
form
of
encrypt
at
all
and
thi
group
span
peopl
from
the
moron
who
still
insist
that
the
de
is
a
good
and
secur
standard
to
peopl
look
at
tri
to
improv
upon
exist
strategi
i
can
not
think
of
anyon
of
them
who
would
approv
blindli
of
a
strategi
that
leav
their
method
open
to
abus
the
clipper
doe
thi
becaus
peopl
make
mistak
by
natur
and
the
u
govern
is
made
up
of
peopl
who
are
just
a
vulner
to
mistak
a
everyon
el
third
sinc
most
of
the
peopl
i
know
are
at
least
marginali
familiar
with
the
vulner
present
in
current
softwar
encrypt
stratigi
i
cant
see
how
most
of
them
are
go
to
blindli
trust
that
someon
will
not
figur
out
a
good
way
to
compromis
the
clipper
chip
that
despit
ani
strength
or
weak
that
may
exist
in
it
so
i
can
not
see
a
high
degre
of
confid
develop
in
the
chip
fourth
when
it
come
to
crimin
abus
sure
there
are
mani
stupid
peopl
out
there
and
ye
some
will
be
open
to
be
caught
via
the
built
in
back
door
of
the
clipper
chip
howev
anyon
who
is
go
to
do
ani
seriou
investig
of
how
best
to
secur
their
data
is
go
to
run
into
that
problem
pretti
damn
fast
and
i
would
assum
start
look
around
for
other
easili
obtain
method
of
encrypt
if
noth
el
were
aval
none
of
thi
would
be
an
issu
howev
the
truth
is
that
most
privat
encrypt
user
that
ive
ever
run
into
simpli
do
not
give
a
damn
about
the
legal
statu
of
rsa
or
pgp
or
anyth
el
if
it
work
they
use
it
thi
is
not
go
to
chang
either
i
do
not
think
for
a
moment
that
anyon
with
seriou
crimin
intent
will
be
slow
down
by
the
advent
of
the
clipper
chip
it
is
all
to
easi
to
convert
encrypt
data
into
unintellg
garbag
a
it
is
if
anyth
the
clipper
chip
just
add
anoth
tool
to
the
user
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
peopl
will
use
what
work
and
unavoid
im
sure
most
crimin
would
rather
face
an
encrypt
relat
charg
than
one
which
could
potentiali
lead
to
death
penalti
charg
in
the
case
of
crimin
who
murder
a
part
of
their
conspirici
the
other
thing
that
ha
struck
me
sinc
the
advent
and
wide
useag
of
public
encrypt
ha
begun
is
that
quit
simpli
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
or
if
you
have
an
interest
in
snoop
pandora
box
ha
been
open
and
thi
is
not
go
to
chang
ive
seen
a
blind
to
thi
that
ive
found
utterli
stun
and
the
clipper
chip
along
with
the
way
it
ha
been
present
onli
confirm
