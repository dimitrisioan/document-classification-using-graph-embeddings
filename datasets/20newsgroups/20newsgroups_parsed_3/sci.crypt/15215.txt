a
of
yet
there
ha
been
no
descript
of
the
gener
principl
behind
the
clipper
propos
for
exampl
is
thi
a
public
key
system
or
a
privat
key
system
if
the
latter
then
i
dont
see
how
the
system
could
work
given
that
the
key
are
tie
to
the
devic
and
not
the

further
the
escrow

are
split
into
two

one
of
these
bit
chunk
and

keysearch
machin
would
allow
you
to
read
the

im
not
suggest
that
thi
