the
greatest
danger
of
the
escrow
databas
if
it
were
kept
on
disk
would
be
the
chanc
that
a
complet
copi
could
somehow
leak
out
you
of
cours
then
it
hard
to
backup
howev
i
think
the
consequ
of
no
backup
the
data
is
not
there
when
a
warrant
come
are
wors
than
the
consequ
of
a
secret
backup
if
the
data
isnt
there
when
the
warrant
come
you
effect
have
secur
crypto
if
secret
backup
are
keptthen
you
effect
have
no
crypto
thu
thi
poster
is
essentiali
argu
no

is
better
than
secur

if
the
data
isnt
there
when
the
warrant
come
then
the
govern
will
just
have
to
use
normal
law
enforc
techniqu
to
catch
crook
is
thi
so
bad
btw
bug
isnt
yet
a
normal
law
enforc
techniqu
with
the
privaci
clipper
it
will
becom
a
normal
