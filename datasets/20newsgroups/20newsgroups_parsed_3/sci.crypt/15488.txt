can
you
while
my
mind
is
on
it
give
u
one
good
reason
that
the
algorithm
should
be
a
secret
algorithm
unless
thi
encrypt
scheme
either
is
a
joke
or
contain
featur
like
a
master
key
or
other
back

hmm
here
are
a
coupl

the
algorithm
becom
known
it
will
be

skipjack

it

the

from

thi
is
probabl
true
howev
from
a
practic
point
of

those
chip
must
have
some
kind
of
key
exchang
protocol
builtin
what
if
it
is
good
old
rsa
thi
will
mean
that
