the

requir
that
wiretap
be
request
by
the
execut
branch
and
approv
by
the
judici
branch
it
seem
clear
that
one
of
the
key
regist
bodi
should
be
under
the
control
of
the
judici
branch
i
suggest
the
suprem

the
court

more
specif
the

of
their

oper
some
of
these

are
confidenti
so
the
concept
of
a

preced
the
judiciari
is
more
immun
to
pressur
from
the
execut

than
ani
execut

agenc
or
contractor
can
be
so
judici
control
of
key
is
appropri
for
the
other
half
of

i
suggest
a

the

the

ha
no

over
it
with
key
split
between

we

thi

if
