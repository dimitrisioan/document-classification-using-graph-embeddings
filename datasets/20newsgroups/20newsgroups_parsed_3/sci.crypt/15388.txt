re
automat
onlin
encrypt
of
data
from
marc
anderson
also
how
about
a
box
that
you
plug
your
phone
into
which
would
allow
encrypt
voic
commun
with
someon
who
ha
a
similar
box
digit
input
speech
transmit
and
decrypt
on
the
other
end
i
dont
know
how
a
publickey
system
could
work
in
thi
regard
but
it
might
heh
heh
i
post
thi
just
befor
read
all
the
clinton
chip
messag
i
guess
they
beat
me
to
it
anyway
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
idea
to
develop
such
a
product
perhap
in
the
underground
a
it
would
otherwis
probabl
becom
illeg
pretti
quickli
here
it
realli
veri
feasibl
and
shouldnt
be
too
expens
all
that
need
is
a
box
with
a
phone
jack
on
one
side
a
dsp
in
the
middl
to
do
codec
function
of
speechcompress
bytestream
and
an
r
on
the
other
side
youd
plug
your
phone
into
it
plug
the
r
into
your
comput
and
have
a
good
old
fashion
normal
modem
on
your
other
r
port
the
cpu
in
the
middl
would
do
the
encrypt
with
a
version
of
pgp
modifi
to
work
on
a
byte
stream
with
vbi
or
better
modem
to
carri
the
bytestream
it
should
work
qualiti
would
onli
be
margin
lower
than
a
normal
telephon
at
the
veri
highest
price
you
could
use
one
of
those
voicemail
compat
modem
to
do
the
digitis
that
put
an
upper
bound
of
about
on
the
cost
of
such
a
box
in
practic
you
realli
ought
to
be
abl
to
get
the
price
well
below
i
could
do
it
now
in
softwar
on
my
cheapnasti
home
risc
box
acorn
archimed
with
the
digitis
microphon
i
bought
for
pound
if
i
knew
how
to
write
good
speech
compress
softwar
which
i
dont
the
reason
it
wont
work
of
cours
is
that
hardli
anyon
will
have
one
the
onli
consum
equip
to
have
encrypt
will
use
the
wiretap
chip
econom
im
afraid
howev
we
can
get
about
kcp
throughput
on
the
internet
even
with
the
bottleneck
of
a
vbi
modem
when
we
get
isdn
for
all
ha
ha
ha
and
the
new
nren
it
might
then
be
trivial
to
run
compress
speech
over
a
tcpip
connect
on
the
internet
perhap
we
should
start
think
now
of
a
standard
to
keep
voic
on
the
internet
compat
for
everyon
and
sidestep
the
clipper
stuff
and
use
internet
for
all
our
phone
call
in
futur
