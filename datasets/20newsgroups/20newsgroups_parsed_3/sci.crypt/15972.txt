write
second
question
whi
whi
is
such
a
strang
procedur
use
and
not
a
real
rng
thi
turn
those
s
in
a
kind
of
bottleneck
for
system
secur
the
onli
theori
that
make
ani
sens
is
that
s
and
s
are
either
the
same
for
all
chip
or
vari
among
veri
few
possibl
so
that
anyon
tri
to
break
the
encrypt
by
brute
forc
need
onli
plow
through
the
possibl
serial
number
about
one
billion
multipli
by
the
number
of
differ
s
s
combin
my
interpret
of
den
descript
is
that
s
and
s
are
chosen
randomli
by
agent
of
the
key
escrow
compani
at
the
start
of
each
chip
program
session
i
imagin
that
the
chip
are
in
a
carrier
which
will
allow
them
all
to
be
program
fairli
quickli
there
would
not
be
a
need
to
transfer
chip
one
at
a
time
into
a
littl
pla
programm
a
some
peopl
have
envis
my
guess
a
to
whi
thi
procedur
is
use
is
that
base
the
key
on
the
s
and
s
use
a
specifi
algorithm
provid
an
inprincipl
checkabl
way
to
verifi
that
no
back
door
exist
in
the
choic
of
the
random
number
use
to
gener
the
key
sinc
we
have
to
trust
the
escrow
compani
anyway
it
doe
not
weaken
the
system
to
have
the
key
be
gener
from
random
seed
enter
by
the
escrow
agent
and
sinc
the
algorithm
for
keygener
is
public
modulo
skipjack
secreci
then
in
principl
an
agent
could
challeng
the
procedur
ask
for
s
and
s
to
be
expos
and
run
hi
own
independ
calcul
of
u
and
u
to
verifi
that
that
is
what
is
actual
be
put
onto
the
floppi
and
ye
there
are
mani
way
in
which
failur
to
follow
thi
scheme
could
be
hard
to
check
the
laptop
probabl
will
not
realli
be
destroy
each
time
hidden
camera
in
the
ceil
could
see
the
s
and
s
enter
by
the
trust
escrow
agent
back
door
in
the
chip
could
allow
u
to
be
recov
heck
each
chip
could
be
record
with
the
same
u
ignor
what
wa
