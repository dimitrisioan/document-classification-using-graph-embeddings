need
to

these
could

the

f
the

is

enforc
after
an
author
wiretap
ha
been
instal
suppos
i
knew
how
the
algorithm
work
and
knew
the
n
for
my
chip
but
did
not
know
f
then
by
cryptanalysi
i
might
be
abl
to
determin
f
from
if
law
enforc
field
eek
u
n
f
not
know
n
would
might
make
thi
much
harder
now
suppos
that
i
know
f
either
legitim
or
not
if
i
know
k
either
becaus
i
am
involv
in
the
convers
or
i
know
u
for
a
parti
in
the
convers
i
may
now
be
abl
to
determin
u
for
the
other
parti
if
i
know
f
i
can
also
defeat
the
law
enforc
field
sinc
i
could
make
my
own
with
a
differ
k
then
the
one
i
am
use
know
f
also
allow
traffic
analysi
to
be
perform
so
i
might
not
know
what
you
are
say
but
i
could
know
who
you
are
say
it
too
now
i
admit
that
someon
tri
to
comput
u
will
not
have
lot
of
messag
to
work
from
but
sinc
we
have
no
way
of
know
that
the
key
gener
method
doe
not
deliber
gener
weak
key
or
for
that
matter
that
the
publish
method
is
in
fact
use
perhap
the
u
will
be
chosen
from
know
weak
key
for
the
system
obvious
the
compromis
of
f
would
be
a
disast
both
to
law
enforc
for
whom
thi
whole
thing
is
design
and
for
the
peopl
who
believ
that
it
is
give
them
secur
f
is
but
one
number
and
i
sure
that
alot
of
peopl
more
then
know
what
it
is
and
if
some
panel
of
expert
is
go
to
check
it
over
for
flaw
then
mani
more
will
know
f
forget
grind
chip
briberi
and
blackmail
work
just
fine
so
am
i
wrong
or
are
these
problem
jon
