write
a

i
spoke
today
with
the
compani
mention
in
a
washington
time
articl
about
the
clipper
chip
announc
the
name
of
the
compani
is
secur
commun
technolog
inform
will
be
given
at
the
end
of
thi
messag
on
how
to
contact
them
hi
belief
is
that
att
wa
made
known
of
the
clipper
well
befor
the
rest
of
the
industri
thi
is
for
sever
reason
sever
of
which
are
thi
is
a
veri
good
point
att
obvious
knew
and
particip
in
the
develop
of
the
clipper
chip
thi
amount
to
unfair
busi
practic
and
give
att
an
earli
monopoli
on
the
market
hope
a
nonexist
market
other
compani
that
compet
with
att
in
the
cellular
market
motorola
nec
etc
have
ground
to
file
a
complaint
over
thi
right
now
the
compani
is
afraid
that
the
new
clipper
chip
will
put
them
out
of
busi
thi
is
a
veri
real
possibl
so
they
realli
need
help
in
stop
the
clipper
chip
from
becom
a
standard
if
you
want
to
contact
them
they
can
be
reach
at
secur

it
would
seem
that
the
one
fact
that
the
govern
ha
overlook
in
thi
whole
fiasco
is
the
econom
standpoint
a
other
have
mention
the
most
difficulti
the
clipper
chip
face
is
an
econom
one
let
face
it
the
averag
consum
doesnt
care
or
know
that
the
clipper
is
a
bad
idea
if
there
is
a
perceiv
need
for
cellular
encrypt
then
the
compani
will
provid
one
most
like
a
standard
will
emerg
but
if
the
clipper
is
too
expens
and
a
chip
is
way
too
much
then
they
will
develop
their
own
or
buy
a
cheaper
one
i
give
sct
my
full
support
and
hope
the
clipper
chip
goe
the
way
of
the
beta
video
tape
format
also
hope
they
get
