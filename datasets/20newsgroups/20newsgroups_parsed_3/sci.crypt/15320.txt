the
system
is
vulner
to
simpl
phone
swap
attack
like
thi
crimin
will
quickli
figur
thi
out
and
go
to
town
depend
it
possibl
that
the
phone
send
it
serial
number
in
the
clear
at
some
specifi
interv
so
all
a
listen
need
to
do
is
get
that
sn
and
then
get
the
key
for
it
so
swap
phone
isnt
a
problem
for
the
govt
that
is
they
still
know
that
thi
line
belong
to
you
so
they
just
watch
the
line
and
see
the
sn
and
then
they
get
the
key
for
that
sn
in
either
case
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
thi
a
bit
deeperjblmwwxld
well
i
think
thi
is
understood
the
major
problem
is
that
a
lot
of
peopl
just
dont
trust
thi
key
escrow
stuff
and
the
fact
that
the
algorithm
are
classifi
so
ye
a
lot
of
thi
need
to
be
look
at
closer
