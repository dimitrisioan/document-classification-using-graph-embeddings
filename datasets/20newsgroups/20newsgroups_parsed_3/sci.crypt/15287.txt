write
how
can
the
govern
tell
which
encrypt
method
one
is
use
without
be
abl
to
decod
the
traffic
ie
in
order
to
accus
me
of
use
an
unauthor
strong
encrypt
techniqu
they
would
have
to
take
both
key
out
of
escrow
run
them
against
my
ciphertext
and
draw
a
blank
i
wa
think
about
thi
also
it
quit
possibl
the
system
transmit
in
clear
the
serial
number
of
the
devic
be
use
that
way
they
can
start
a
tap
get
the
serial
number
and
use
the
warrant
for
the
first
tap
to
get
the
key
if
they
tap
someon
who
appar
use
encrypt
but
dont
find
that
prefix
then
theyll
assum
it
an
unauthor
encrypt
scheme
from
the
limit
detail
releas
so
far
it
seem
that
the
clipper
chip
system
must
employ
some
sort
of
public
key
cryptographi
otherwis
the
key
manag
problem
inher
to
symetr
cipher
would
make
the
system
unwork
it
probabl
ha
some
sort
of
public
key
exchang
that
take
place
at
the
start
of
each
call
that
how
they
would
identifi
the
privat
key
in
their
data
base
thi
mean
that
either
the
nsa
ha
develop
some
non
rsa
public
key
algorythm
or
the
fed
have
decid
to
subsid
pkp
rsadsi
the
former
is
rather
an
excit
posibl
sinc
keep
the
algorythm
secret
while
make
chip
impliment
wide
avalib
will
be
except
hard
if
the
fed
are
forc
to
make
it
aval
in
order
to
gain
public
accept
than
that
could
break
rsa
stranglehold
on
public
key
crypto
in
the
u
a
for
my
impress
of
the
whole
scheme
it
seem
that
instead
of
tri
to
ban
strong
crypto
they
are
tri
to
coopt
it
their
content
that
they
need
to
keep
the
algorythm
secret
to
protect
the
secur
of
the
key
registr
suggest
possibl
inher
weak
to
the
algorythm
more
like
is
that
they
dont
want
anyon
construct
black
market
devic
which
dont
have
the
key
regist
anyon
els
notic
that
in
their
qa
session
they
talk
about
releas
the
key
onli
to
peopl
with
proper
autior
but
care
danc
around
state
that
the
key
will
simpli
have
to
be
supeona
they
seem
to
be
tri
to
keep
open
the
posibl
of
obtain
key
without
court
order
even
though
tap
a
phone
line
requir
one
also
pick
up
on
their
implicit
threat
of
eith
accept
thi
or
well
ban
strong
crypto
outright
i
dont
trust
thi
plan
at
all
and
plan
to
oppos
it
in
all
legal
way
