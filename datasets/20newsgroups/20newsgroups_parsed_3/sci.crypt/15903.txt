do

the

may

it

you

clipper

i
will
restat
my
assumpt
more
explicitli
and
amplifi
my
argument
the
origin
titl
perhap
should
have
been
distinct
between
legal
and
illeg
cipher
system
consid
harm
but
clipper
consid
harm
is
not
inaccur
and
is
more
eyecatch
in
the
current
context
assumpt
clipper
is
made
avail
law
are
pass
to
make
use
of
cipher
system
other
than
clipper
illeg
either
on
radio
system

on

these
law
also

valid

detect
probabl
use

and
make

detect
a
caus
for
further
action
for
escrow
key
to
be
use
some
specif
clipper

must
be

at

the

both

that

enforc
onc

they
will
also
figur

becaus
they

they

gener
avoid

they

would
rais

to

skipjack
discov

of

it
will
be

it

the
