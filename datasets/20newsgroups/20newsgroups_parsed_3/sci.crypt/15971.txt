write
i
forward
an
old
post
about
celp
speech
compress
ive
sinc
been
told
that
the
sourc
of
thi
is
on
cygnuscom
in
pubcelpspeechtarz
im
not
in
a
posit
to
ani
sun
tcpip
guru
out
there
who
think
they
can
marri
thi
with
netfon
by
the
end
of
the
week
serious
i
think
someon
with
real
net
access
and
two
sparc
could
have
thi
run
by
the
end
of
the
week
then
we
ask
the
pgp
guy
to
add
a
bytestream
crypto
filter
two
week
at
the
most
damn
i
wish
i
had
my
sparc
back
im
stuck
on
a
mhz
sx
i
tri
thi
code
yesterday
on
my
sparcstat
elc
it
take
over
second
to
compress
second
worth
of
speech
thi
mean
that
it
need
to
be
optim
by
over
a
factor
of
befor
it
will
be
usabl
in
even
a
halfduplex
mode
i
question
whether
celp
is
the
best
approach
for
thi
applic
it
produc
great
compress
but
at
the
expens
of
tremend
cpu
load
we
want
someth
that
can
be
run
on
ordinari
workstat
or
even
highend
pc
without
dsp
card
my
guess
is
that
some
other
algorithm
is
go
to
be
a
better
