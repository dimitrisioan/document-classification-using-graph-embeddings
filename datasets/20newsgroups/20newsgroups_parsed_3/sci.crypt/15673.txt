write
a
rough
estim
suggest
that
wiretap
are
worth
about
five
million
dollar
per
year
to
u
law
enforc
agenc
in
u
wiretap
led
to

thi
wiretap
benefit
more
accur
but
you
seem
to
be
assum
that
all
arrest
are
of
equal
valu
and
that
the
use
of
wiretap
is
spread
uniformli
among
them
given
thi
compar
tini
number
of
wiretap
and
the
associ

etc
i
expect
that
law
enforc
reserv
the
use
of
wiretap
for
the
most
valuabl
case
sinc
the
valu
of
an
arrest
can
vari
over
an
enorm
rang
eg

mass
murder
i
think
your
million

may
be
too
low
