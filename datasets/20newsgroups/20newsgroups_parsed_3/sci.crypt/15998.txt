encrypt
system
the
govern
seem
to
want

futur
anyon
can
build
a
nonkey
system
we
are
worri
about
a
back

onc
everyon
use
a
clipper
chip
the
mechan
for
a
bigbroth
govern
is
in
place
a
chang
of
govern
can
lead
to
it
especi
sinc
the
escrow
agenc
oper
is
not
govern
by
law
so
the
presid
can
chang
the
rule
to
allow
free
access
to
the
key
at
ani
time
eg
dure
war
few
crimin
are
caught
by

the
cost

risk
are
unjustifi
onc
the
fbi
get
hold
of
a
key
it
can
decrypt
past
and
futur
