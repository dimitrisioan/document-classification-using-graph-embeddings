i
have
a
question
that
is
a
slight
variat
on
the
previous
mention
exampl
that
perhap
peopl
could
give
me
some
pointer
on
it
ha
been
a
coupl
of
year
sinc
my
con
law
class
in
colleg
so
i
hope
i
am
not
miss
someth
obviou
here
basic
scenario
i
set
up
a
bb
that
use
publickey
encrypt
and
encrypt
of
file
on
disk
the
gener
setup
is
design
so
that
when
user
connect
they
send
a
privat
key
encrypt
use
the
system
public
key
and
the
user
publicpriv
keypair
is
use
to
wrap
the
onetim
session
key
use
for
encrypt
the
file
on
disk
the
result
of
thi
is
that
even
if
i
reveal
the
system
privat
key
it
is
imposs
for
anyon
to
gain
access
to
the
file
store
on
the
machin
what
is
possibl
is
for
someon
to
use
the
reveal
system
privat
key
to
entic
user
into
reveal
thier
person
privat
key
dure
the
authent
sequenc
question
doe
the
fact
that
the
system
privat
key
doe
not
provid
ani
inform
use
for
a
search
give
me
ani
protect
a
far
a
be
coerc
to
reveal
the
key
i
doubt
it
myself
it
seem
provid
the
system
privat
key
doe
not
mean
that
i
am
assist
in
entrap
the
user
would
send
thier
key
anyway
and
are
not
be
entic

do
someth
they
would
not
otherwis
do
but
is
there
ani

hook
that
can
