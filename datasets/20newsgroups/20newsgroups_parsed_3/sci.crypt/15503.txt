write
if
the
clipper
chip
can
do
cheap
crypto
for
the
mass
obvious
one
could
do
the
same
thing
without
build
in
back
door
i
agre
so
whi
is
cylink
the
onli
and
expens
game
in

note
i
think
cylink
is
great
and
if
my
bo
would
doubl
my
salari
id
buy
a
bunch
of
their
stuff
one
thing
that
clipper
offer
is
interoper
at
a
higher
degre
of
secur
than
we
current
have
in
nonproprietari
voic
encrypt
system
thi
mean
it
will
be
cheaper
than
anyon
proprietari
scheme
and
easier
to
deploy
thi
is
of
cours
either
a
bug
or
a
featur
depend
on
how
you
look
at
it
inde
even
without
special
engin
you
can
construct
a
good
system
right

increas
the
incent
to
bring
stronger
encrypt
to
the
mass
market
all
the
better
it
far
overpr
at
the
moment
ye
cheap

but
we
dont
need
it
from
the

i
dont
care
where
we
need
to
get
it
from
i
care
where
we
can
get
it
from
and
whether
it
will
interoper
with
everyon
els
inde
were
it
not
