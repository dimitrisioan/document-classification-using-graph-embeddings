write
i
believ
it
is
illeg
to
send
ani
cryptograph
code
out
of
the
countri
without
an
export
licens
other
will
correct
me
if
thi
is
inaccur
glad
to
you
are
correct
it
is
illeg
to
send
cryptograph
code
and
lot
of
other
thing
out
of
the
countri
without
a
licens
howev
everi
u
citizen
ha
a
gener
export
licens
allow
export
of
lot
of
thing
includ
constitut
protect
speech
thi
ha
the
effect
that
it
is
legal
for
u
citizen
to
export
some
thing
which
it
is
illeg
for
a
u
corpor
to
export
without
first
obtain
a
licens
dunno
if
youd
get
one
for
the
particular
code
you
have
the
onli
way
to
find
out
is
to
appli
for
a
licens
nope
talk
to
a
good
lawyer
in
the
area
of
export
law
but
in
gener
the
govern
ha
to
have
a
veri
good
nation
secur
case
to
tri
prevent
the
export
of
anyth
you
person
might
wish
to
publish
ye
i
word
that
the
way
i
did
intent
it
is
a
lot
easier
for
the
govern
to
tri
to
prevent
the
export
of
inform
than
to
charg
someon
with
a
crime
after
the
fact
espionag
is
probabl
the
onli
except
note
that
you
need
to
distinguish
between
what
is
legal
to
send
to
canada
if
you
have
such
a
licens
and
what
is
legal
to
send
if
you
dont
if
you
are
a
u
citizen
you
have
a
gener
licens
i
am
not
a
lawyer
so
take
some
of
thi
with
a
grain
of
salt
howev
i
have
also
had
to
