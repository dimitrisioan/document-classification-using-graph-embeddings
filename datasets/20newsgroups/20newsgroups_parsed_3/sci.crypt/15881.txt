jerri
han
write
a
one
of
the
happili
sleep
peopl
i
would
just
like
to
ask
thi
arent
peopl
just
slightli
overreact
to
thi
or
are
we
all
of
a
sudden
go
to
draw
parallel
to
nazi
germani
and
communist
russia
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
ye
thi
is
a
seriou
problem
but
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
guess
what
were
do
someth
now
you
cant
do
in
a
communist
countri
or
nazi
germani
were
complain
about
it
or
rather
your
complain
about
it
and
nobodi
is
shoot
at
u
we
would
like
to
keep
it
that
way
that
the
point
by
react
strongli
and
forc
now
we
will
assur
that
we
continu
to
remain
free
you
can
not
overreact
to
a
threat
like
thi
the
worst
that
happen
if
we
overreact
is
that
we
wast
time
and
effort
the
worst
that
happen
if
we
underreact
is
tyranni
i
prefer
overreact
myself
guess
what
peopl
you
live
in
one
of
the
few
countri
in
the
world
where
a
person
can
complain
without
get
shot
at
doesnt
that
tell
you
how
preciou
and
hard
to
maintain
freedom
is
onli
through
centuri
of
overreact
have
we
manag
to
maintain
ourselv
in
thi
state
of
even
moder
freedom
i
suggest
that
overreact
now
and
in
the
futur
is
a
good
thing
