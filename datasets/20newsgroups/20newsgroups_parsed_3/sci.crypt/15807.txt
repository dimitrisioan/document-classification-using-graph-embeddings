hi
piec
new
encrypt
to
scicrypt
there
ha
been
some
discus
of
our
compani
secur
commun
technolog
inc
and
on
encrypt
algorithm
nea
i
spoke
to
craig
at
length
on
and
we
cover
a
lot
of
ground
some
of
the
inform
in
the
post
requir
some
clarif
and
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
question
rais
on
scicrypt
sct
is
a
small
compani
base
in
silver
spring
maryland
our
two
main
product
at
thi
time
are
a
pc
base
secur
commun
program
call
secom
and
a
gener
purpos
encrypt
chip
which
use
the
nea
algorithm
develop
for
secom
secom
provid
an
encrypt
secur
commun
link
between
two
pc
connect
over
dial
up
telephon
line
it
support
simultan
bidirect
file
transfer
and
keyboard
to
screen
chat
it
ha
it
own
proprietari
commun
protocol
which
is
tightli
integr
to
the
encrypt
all
though
it
is
a
packet
link
the
data
stream
appear
to
be
continu
becaus
the
packet
boundari
are
hidden
when
secom
wa
initi
develop
it
wa
implement
to
use
de
encrypt
a
busi
decis
wa
made
to
seek
export
approv
for
the
product
becaus
it
wa
perceiv
that
the
oversea
market
wa
a
larg
one
and
provid
a
good
market
opportun
we
soon
found
out
that
we
would
never
be
grant
gener
export
approv
for
anyth
use
de
all
though
the
reason
for
thi
wa
never
explicitli
state
it
seem
to
have
someth
to
do
with
secret
govern
to
govern
agreement
which
are
still
in
effect
in
ani
event
the
decis
wa
made
to
develop
a
new
and
differ
algorithm
which
would
take
the
place
of
de
thi
wa
the
reason
nea
new
encrypt
algorithm
wa
born
at
thi
time
nea
is
be
held
a
a
trade
secret
the
preliminari
work
of
patent
it
ha
begun
and
the
plan
is
to
make
it
public
onc
the
patent
process
is
complet
all
though
one
can
make
certain
legal
argument
for
keep
it
an
ongo
secret
i
think
in
the
case
of
an
encrypt
algorithm
it
is
necessari
to
let
peopl
shoot
at
it
over
an
extend
period
of
time
to
prove
it
worth
in
order
to
get
export
approv
for
secomnea
it
wa
necessari
to
go
through
nsa
and
to
reveal
to
them
the
detail
of
the
program
and
algorithm
thi
wa
done
onli
after
we
had
a
finish
product
to
submit
let
me
state
unequivoc
that
there
is
no
back
door
to
the
program
or
the
algorithm
secur
commun
technolog
is
a
close
held
privat
compani
and
nsafbicianistwhatev
ha
no
financi
interest
in
ani
way
whatsoev
with
the
compani
or
ani
of
the
peopl
involv
from
a
practic
busi
standpoint
we
are
interest
in
sell
chip
and
softwar
hope
in
larg
quantiti
and
a
back
door
to
the
encrypt
if
found
out
could
destroy
our
credibl
and
our
busi
with
the
encrypt
algorithm
approv
for
export
we
set
out
to
talk
to
a
number
of
potenti
custom
for
encrypt
product
and
system
we
were
abl
to
identifi
sever
common
thread
of
function
requir
thi
led
to
the
design
of
a
chip
with
the
encrypt
algorithm
cast
in
silicon
and
certain
other
capabl
ad
so
that
the
chip
could
fulfil
the
broad
rang
of
requir
that
we
identifi
we
are
strongli

our

to

to

on

do
we
not

the
