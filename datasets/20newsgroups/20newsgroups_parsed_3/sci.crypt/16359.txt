but
ha
a
wellknown
flaw
in
authent
suppos
you
use
a
random

stream
a

exclusiveor
a

oper
if
an

know
the
plaintext
of
a
messag
he
can
chang
it
into
ani
other
messag
here
how
it
work
alic
is
send
bob
a
plaintext
p
under
a
key
stream
s
alic
comput
the
ciphertext
c
s
xor
p
and
send
it
to

eve
know
the

want
the

an
asid
i
agre
that
the
weak
exist
but
i
have
a
lot
of
troubl
believ
that
it
repres
a
difficulti
in
real
life
given
the
purpos
of
the
onetim
pad
is
to
give
unbreak
secur
and
the
expens
of
key
distribut
etc
impli
that
the
client
realli
do
want
that
level
of
secur
these
same
peopl
want
to
keep
p
a
secret
i
find
it
hard
to
believ
that
eve
might
happen
to
have
a
copi
of
p
lie
around
i
am
awar
that
the
same
argument
appli
to
eve
know
even
a
small
part
of
the
messag
but
eve
must
know
exactli
where
which
byte
in
c
her
known
susequ
start
or
the
result
will
be
garbl
i
find
thi
at
least
a
surpris
back
to
the
question
if
i
had
the
resourc
to
use
a
onetimepad
for
such
transmiss
i
would
also
append
a
messag
authent
code
to
the
messag
use
up
the
next
bit
of
the
onetimepad
a
the
key
perhap
your
origin
question
basic
ask
whether
there
wa
ani
way
to
authent
the
messag
with
the
same
degre
of
secur
a
the
pad
itself
provid
and
i
dont
know
the
answer
howev
i
would
propos
the
follow
for
discuss
alic
and
bob
have
an
arbitrari
number
of
secret
random
bit
to
share
which
eve
doesnt
know
she
find
them
out
effect
by
know
some
p
and
the
correspond
c
it
is
the
fact
that
they
correspond
that
caus
the
problem
if
a
messag
authent
code
wa
to
be
creat
use
some
onetimepad
oper
such
that
eve
could
not
know
which
part
of
the
mac
were
affect
by
which
part
of
the
input
she
would
be
unabl
to
forg
a
mac
to
correspond
what
is
requir
is
a
nonlinear
combin
of
part
of
the
messag
nonlinear
so
that
simpli
xore
or
subtract
or
whatev
doesnt
have
exactli
the
same
effect
now
at
the
end
of
the
encrypt
messag
c
alic
append
a

mac
is

bob
verifi
the

obviou
manner
he
recov
the

then
us
some
more

to
reproduc
the
mac
in
the
same
manner
nlop
is
the
nonlinear
oper
and
there
is
the
rub
the
simplest
nonlinear
oper
i
can
think
of
is
an
sbox
that
is
have
a
fix
even
publish

an

tabl
call

x

sboxi
practic

thi
solv
your

a

never
see
the
intermedi
output
c
and
henc
cant
deduc
s
or
perform
ani
valid
substitut
on
it
also
practic
speak
you
want
the
mac
to
be
fairli
larg
say
bit
but
you
might
not
want
a
gigabyt
say
sbox
so
you
might
work
on
bytes
sbox
but
i
think
that
is
an
irrelev
detail
for
the
discuss
at
hand
who
will
be
first
to

out
my
error
