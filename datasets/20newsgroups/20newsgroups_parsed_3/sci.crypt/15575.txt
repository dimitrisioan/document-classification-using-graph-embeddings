post
a
veri
interest
messag
in
which
he
comment
on
the
effect
of
the
clipper
chip
on
state
and
local
polic
actual
read
between
the
line
it
could
be
a
veri
good
thing
for
civil
liberti
in
one
respect
sinc
it
will
at
least
prevent
cowboy
cop
and
cowboy
state
and
local
aganc
from
read
your
traffic
if
they
tap
it
illeg
instead
of
read
between
the
line
tri
to
think
a
littl
bit
ok
if
that
way
too
difficult
to
you
here
are
some
hint
inde
the
new
propos
impos
some
addit
burocrat
burden
on
the
local
polic
if
they
badli
want
to
tape
the
magic
cooki
recipi
that
your
mom
is
tell
you
on
the
phone
so
guess
what
they
will
do
propos
that
the
new
technolog
is
remov
or
implement
some
facilit
of
cours
you
wont
want
to
wait
until
they
get
the
approv
from
two
differ
agenc
to
decrypt
the
convers
between
two
child
molest
becaus
meanwhil
those
two
child
molest
might
be
conspir
about
molest
your
child
right
so
there
should
be
some
way
for
them
to
get
access
to
those
key
quickli
right
like
they
could
have
a
copi
of
the
databas
and
worri
about
a
warrant
later
i
perhap
should
have
been
clearer
and
more
concis
in
my
post
but
that
what
i
get
from
post
at
am
the
central
point
i
made
is
that
localst
polic
agenc
attempt
to
play
by
the
rule
and
get
warrant
legit
escrow
key
etc
may
find
themselv
at
the
merci
of
bureaucrat
inertia
and
agenc
infight
at
the
feder
level
i
disagre
that
thi
would
assist
civil
liberti
by
hobbl
the
cowboy
cop
it
would
be
a
strong
incent
a
vesselin
point
out
for
more
polic
agenc
to
go
rogu
and
tri
to
get
key
through
more
effici
but
le
constitut
mean
notic
what
the
releas
said
q
suppos
a
law
enforc
agenc
is
conduct
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggl
ring
and
intercept
a
convers
encrypt
use
the
devic
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
deciph
the
messag
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
author
normal
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
the
clear
implic
is
that
there
are
legal
author
other
than
a
court
order
just
how
leaki
are
these
and
who
know
what
in
those
page
that
author
the
nsa
there
may
well
aris
a
black
market
of
sort
within
polic
agenc
in
which
key
are

furthermor
the
polic
will
be
in
an
excel
posit
to
carri
out
thi
kind
of
thing
without
be
caught
they
alreadi
have
a

with

there
are
a
few
law
that
i
know
of
that

citizen
right
to

commun
or
use
the
inform
they
get
it
may
be

difficult
to

the
