it
realli
work
wa
re
text
of
white
hous
announc
and
qa
on
clipper
chip
encrypt
from
marc
vanheyningen
the
major
of
the
discuss
involv
thi
clipper
chip
seem
to
pertain
to
the
encrypt
of
telephon
convers
doe
anyon
know
if
that
mean
thi
chip
is
design
to
work
primarili
with
analog
signal
the
languag
sort
of
suggest
thi
but
it
hard
to
say
id
lay
a
few
buck
that
it
just
dataindataout
in
parallel
i
suspect
to
make
it
a
phone
youd
need
a
codec
and
speech
compress
there
would
be
a
loss
of
bandwidth
on
the
speech
signal
which
i
suspect
would
scupper
ani
of
the
suggest
ive
seen
here
about
put
a
differ
encrypt
front
end
on
it
there
no
hint
of
ani
modul
scheme
in
the
doc
im
sure
it
pure
a
digit
chip
the
back
end
will
come
later
but
im
posit
it
wont
be
left
to
the
manufactur
they
all
have
to
be
the
same
modul
scheme
to
make
it
easi
for
the
nsa
to
tap
them
the
onli
other
possibl
is
that
thi
is
intend
onli
for
isdn
phone
put
a
whole
new
spin
on
eff
obsess
about
isdn
if
true
bwahahaha
