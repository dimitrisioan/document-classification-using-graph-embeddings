we

thi
do
we
the
algorithm
is
classifi
i
specul
from
the
mykotronx
data
sheet
on
the
myk
that
the
algorithm
is
a
classifi
cryptosystem
similar
in
applic
to
de
but
clear
by
the
nsa
for
classifi
traffic
that
ha
been
in
use
for
a
number
of
year
myktotronx
refer
to
it
a
govern
type
ii
encrypt
which
match
the
design
of
one
of
the
type
of
encrypt
avail
on
stuiii
phone
and
may
be
the
same
a
a
cryptosystem
i
have
heard
call
cipher
thi
would
make
sen
sinc
thi
is
evid
a
fieldproven
cryptosystem
which
can
act
a
a
pincompat
substitut
for
de
combin
with
a
tappabl
key
exchang
protocol
thi
would
offer
exactli
what
is
claim
for
clipper
secur
encrypt
with
access
via
a
key
escrow
if
thi
is
fact
the
case
it
would
make
me
quit
confid
of
the
encipher
algorithm
itself
now
i
do
not
know
if
these
are
in
fact
the
same
cryptosystem
my
knowledg
of
classifi
cryptographi
isnt
even
fuzzi
it
nonexist
howev
it
would
certainli
have
been
the
leasteffort
approach
on
the
part
of
the
govern
take
an
old
militari
cipher
that
peopl
can
drop
in
place
of
de
and
which
is
at
least
a
secur
set
up
a
key
escrow
scheme
for
law
enforc
and
promot
it
for
public
use
thi
also
fit
