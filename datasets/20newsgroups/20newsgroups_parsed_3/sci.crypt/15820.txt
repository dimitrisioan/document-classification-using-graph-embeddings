write
in
order
to
get
export
approv
for
secomnea
it
wa
necessari
to
go
through
nsa
and
to
reveal
to
them
the
detail
of
the
program
and
algorithm
thi
wa
done
onli
after
we
had
a
finish
product
to
submit
with
the
encrypt
algorithm
approv
for
export
we
set
pleas
dont
be
insult
but
base
on
thi
i
would
say
that
your
encrypt
algorithm
is
veri
like
not
worth
the
paper
it
print
on
if
the
nsa
gave
export
approv
that
mean
they
felt
confid
that
they
could
crack
it
that
their
job
mandat
by
law
and
im
sure
they
believ
in
what
they
do
if
they
gave
export
approv
to
an
encrypt
algorithm
which
they
werent
confid
of
be
abl
to
crack
they
would
be
derelict
in
their
sworn
duti
to
monitor
foreign
commun
for
u
nation
secur
relat
materi
just
becaus
mani
most
of
u
think
that
the
govern
and
the
spook
are
pugnaci
slimebal
is
no
reason
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
they
do
their
job
to
the
best
of
their
abil
and
further
that
said
abil
is
rather
high
i
hope
that
one
day
we
can
make
them
all
obsolet
but
until
then
we
have
to
cope
with
their
exist
export
approv
are
one
thing
they
do
that
we
can
learn
a
lot
from

exampl
