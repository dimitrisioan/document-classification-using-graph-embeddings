encrypt

then
k
will
be
encrypt
under
the
unit
key
uk
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
ad
to
produc
a
three
part
messag
which
will
then
be
encrypt
under
the

key
sk
produc
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
my
understand
is
that
em
k
is
not
encrypt
under
sk
call
the
famili
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
correspond
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforc
doe
anyon
have
first
hand
knowledg
on
thi
i
will
also
check
it
out
but
thi
is
am
sunday
so
i
did
not
want
to
wait
ok
so
there
are
in
fact
two
distinct
compon
transmit
by
the
chip
the
real
messag
encrypt
with
the
convent
key
and
the
serial
number
and
encrypt
convent
key
encrypt
with
the
imho
kind
of
bogu
a
the
whole
concept
of
one
key
that
million
of
peopl
use
which
cant
be
chang
doesnt
seem
reason
famili
key
suppos
i
analyz
the
output
of
thi
chip
and
im
abl
to
determin
which
bit
are
the
encrypt
packet
which
contain
the
serial
number
and
session
key
suppos
i
also
design
a
simpl
algorithm
base
on
thi
inform
which
take
the
data
contain
the
encrypt
session
key
and
twiddl
a
bit
or
sever
befor
it
sent
down
the
line
mind
you
im
sure
the
nsa
thought
of
thi
along
with
a
dozen
other
attack
i
cant
imagin
and
the
system
is
probabl
somehow
design
so
that
manipul
of
thi
inform
will
caus
a
compliant
receiv
chip
to
somehow
fail
to
decrypt
success
but
how
what
if
the
two
parti
agre
in
advanc
on
some
kind
of
consist
bittwiddl
scheme
so
the
decrypt
chip
see
the
restor
proper
bitstream
but
an
eavesdropp
get
a
ek
uk
packet
that
wrong
i
suppos
thi
could
be
easili
defeat
if
the
chip
send
that
inform
out
mani
time
in
slightli
differ

make
it
effect
imposs
to
be

you
