i
think
that
mindset
is
a
mistak
befor
there
were
cattl
prod

their

there
were

technolog
to
oppress
the
evil
lie
not
in
the
tool
but
in
the
wielder
of
the
tool
evil
and
good
walk
hand
in

it
is
also
import
to
note
that
the
good
in
the

technolog
repres
one
of
the

for

our
freedom
from
those
who
have
stolen
them
i
can
not
accept
thi
ridicul
leap
in
logic
technolog
is
neutral
to
good
or
evil
when
technolog
is
use
by
evil
men
it
is
call
evil
technolog
when
it
is
use
by
good
men
it
is
call
good
technolog
realli
it
is
just
technolog
that
allow
action
to
be
realiz
more

on
a
