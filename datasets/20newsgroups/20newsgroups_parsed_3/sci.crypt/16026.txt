im
afraid
thi
doesnt
work
either
we
can
pick
up
laptop
screen
without
ani
problem
most
of
the
socal
low
radiat
monitor
are
also
useless
the
descript
turn
out
to
a
market
assert
rather
than
an
engin
one
we
thought
there
might
be
a
market
for
a
monitor
which
wa
not
a
huge
expens
a
the
militari
tempest
kit
but
which
wa
well
enough
shield
to
stop
eavesdrop
use
avail
receiv
we
built
a
prototyp
it
work
and
it
still
sit
on
my
lab
bench
commerci
interest
wa
exactli
zero
in
the
absenc
of
open
standard
a
monitor
which
realli
is
low
radiat
and
cost
dollar
more
cant
compet
against
a
monitor
which
just
claim
to
be
low
radiat
and
whose
onli
extra
cost
of
product
is
the
pretti
blue
sticker
on
the
box
ross
i
heard
somewher
cant
name
the
sourc
that
tempest
doe
not
necessarili
pickup
just
crt
but
it
can
pick
up
emiss
from
almost
ani
chip
if
that
is
true
the
kind
monitor
would
not
make
ani
differ
becuas
everyth
on
the
screen
can
be
pickedup
from
the
video
control
can
anybodi
verifi
or
refut
thi
btw
these
are
my
opinion
and
not
that

other
entiti
