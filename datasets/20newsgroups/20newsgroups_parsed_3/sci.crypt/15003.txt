write
thi
suggest
a
new
pc
secur
product
design
approach
first
fill
the
hard
drive
with
random
file
and
file
encrypt
under
a
number
of
known
key
then
whenev
a
new
secret
file
is
creat
you
delet
a
random
file
and
replac
it
with
real
encrypt
data
new
nonsecret
file
are
encrypt
under
a
known
key
better
yet
instead
of
thrash
around
on
the
do
file
system
take
it
a
step
further
write
yourself
a
minim
file
system
program
that
is
use
to
createdelet
file
endecrypt
them
to
ramdisk
list
a
directori
put
the
util
password
protect
on
a
floppi
the
catch
is
that
the
storag
space
use
by
thi
util
is
not
part
of
the
do
file
system
instead
defrag
your
disk
thu
pack
all
alloc
cluster
into
cluster
n
then
use
the
back
end
of
the
partit
to
hold
your
stealth
file
system
or
leav
a
small
nd
partit
on
the
disk
that
is
not
assign
to
do
anoth
approach
might
be
to
use
a
directori
that
contain
a
set
of
invari
file
do
system
file
for
instanc
due
to
do
alloc
a
minimum
storag
unit
of
a
cluster
there
is
unus
physic
space
on
the
disk
between
the
tail
end
of
each
file
and
the
end
of
it
associ
cluster
these
dead
space
could
be
concaten
and
use
to
hold
your
stealth
file
system
now
you
have
a
situat
where
no
encrypt
data
appear
on
your
disk
at
all
