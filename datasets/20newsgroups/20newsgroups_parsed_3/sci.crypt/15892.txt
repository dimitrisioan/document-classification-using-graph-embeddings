can
someon
tell
me
if
hardwar
compress
is
or
is
not
need
to
run
digit
speech
down
k
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
it
not
let
say
bit
sampl
would
raw
data
at
the
correspond
sampl
rate
be
usabl
if
not
how
fanci
doe
the
compress
need
to
be
a
far
a
i
know
isdn
call
it
swissnet
here
and
it
be
plug
in
it
bit
hz
give
you
one
channel
of
kbitsec
i
guess
you
should
not
go
below
a
sampl
rate
of
hz
if
you
want
to
have
same
qualiti
a
on
an
analoglin
anybodi

factor
for
voic
ive
post
some
info
on
celp
code
on
scicrypt
look
like
you
can
squeez
speech
into
bp
if
you
have
a
fast
enough
comput
like
a
sparcstat
or
a
newton
with
the
acorn
risc
machin
in
it
thi
drop
the
bandwidth
to
so
low
a
figur
that
it
feasibl
to
run
speech
over
tcpip
run
on
top
of
slip
down
a
vbi
modem
not
onli
will
thi
let
u
run
point
to
point
encrypt
speech
itll
let
u
run
speech
intern
over
the
internet
if
noon
stop
u
by
get
veri
heavi
about
regul
the
thought
of
thi
if
the
administr
realis
would
probabl
scare
them
shitless
now
of
cours
the
trick
is
to
develop
and
defin
a
standard
protocol
for
internet
speech
damn
fast
allow
anyon
who
feel
brave
to
inplement
custom
handheld
hardwar
a
well
a
u
hack
it
on
our
workstat
shouldnt
be
too
difficult
the
celp
stuff
is
standardis
we
use
tcpip
stream
and
a
protocol
allow
silenc
to
be
use
to
catch
up
on
ani
net
lag
and
also
to
avoid
send
ani
data
dure
silenc
ie
it
not
wise
to
be
synchronis
realtim
on
each
end
becaus
ani
net
delay
would
add
up
to
big
voicelag
a
for

im
go

thi
stuff
a
soon
a
i
get
my
sparc

loan
out
and
buy
