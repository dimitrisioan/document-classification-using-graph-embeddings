whi
is
the

use
is
it
just
to
gain
an

increas
in

to
defeat
a
potenti
keysearch
if
so
whi
use
bit
key
not
know
anyth
about
the
skipjack
algorithm
it
not
realli
possibl
to
guess
whether
thi
make
it
harder
or
easier
to
guess
s
whi
are
n
n
and
n
form
a
they
are
it
would
be
facin
to
see
the
skipjack
algorithm
to
look
for
way
of
attack
it
that
requir
three
ciphertext
block
form
in
that
odd
way
where
do
the
bit
constant
valu
that
are
concaten
with
the
serial
number
to
form
nnn
come
from
are
they
chang
from
chip
to
chip
or
session
to
session
even
if
theyr
publish
in
the
ny
time
if
skipjack
is
resist
to
knownplaintext
attack
when
use
tripl
encrypt
then
there
no
break
in
secur
but
whi
allow
that
kind
of
weird
format
if
those
three
bit
valu
are
trulyrandom
bit
then
mayb
it
use
to
ensur
that
a
knownplaintext
attack
on
skipjack
if
it
exist
cant
be
easili
use
to
deriv
s
and
s
for
a
whole
product
run
of
these
chip
i
cant
answer
all
our
question
in
detail
but
i
can
take
a
stab
at
them
the
form
the
oper
that
comput
r
r
and
r
is
of
cours
the
famou
tripl
encrypt
suggest
for
use
with
de
it
much
stronger
than
a
singl
encrypt
and
ha
an
effect
key
length
of
bit
for
reason
that
were
discus
when
de
wa
first
standard
a
simpl
doubl
encrypt
would
not
have
the
same
strength
tripl
encrypt
ha
been
use
by
ibm
sinc
more
or
le
the
begin
to
encrypt
other
key
it
recommend
for
anyth
of
veri
high
valu
and
i
think
we
can
agre
that
the
ri
and
si
fit
that
descript
whi
n
n
and
n
well
you
need
differ
plaintext
valu
i
have
no
idea
if
theyll
be
disclos
or
not
at
a
guess
theyr
construct
so
that
they
differ
in
a
mani
bit
posit
a
possibl
a
goo
cryptosystem
will
scrambl
thing
a
lot
with
even
a
bit
chang
but
the
valu
of
n
in
a
seri
will
have
fairli
similar
bit
pattern
and
there
might
conceiv
be
a
weak
so
the
ni
valu
are
and
im
guess
chosen
to
increas
the
ham
distanc
in
ani
event
im
quit
convinc
that
one
can
not
go
back
to
the
si
from
the
ui
let
alon
u
observ
if
the
nsa
ha
u
they
dont
need
to
find
si
but
even
if
they
do
they
cant
get
u
and
u
in
theori
they
should
never
even
see
those
valu
even
with
a
warrant
the
real
question
i
think
is
whi
use
thi
scheme
at
all
a
oppos
to
a
hardwar
random
number
gener
my
answer
is
that
thi
is
much
more
verifi
look
suppos
that
nsa
nist
the
aclu
the
eff
and
the
nra
combin
to
build
a
realli
good
random
number
gener
and
that
it
pas
everi
test
you
could
think
of
when
you
come
back
next
week
to
program
some
more
chip
doe
it
still
work
that
well
have
ani
compon
chang
in
valu
have
the
compon
been
chang
out
from
under
you
doe
it
still
work
well
the
in
the
presenc
of
a
focus
microwav
beam
that
tend
to
bia
it
toward
select
bit
ye
you
can
run
detail
statist
test
on
it
again
but
that
hard
consid
on
the
other
hand
a
softwar
solut
you
bring
your
own
floppi
with
you
you
can
run
cryptograph
checksum
etc
it
a
lot
easier
to
verifi
that
the
softwar
is
unchang
in
other
word
ye
i
can
think
of
way
to
cheat
softwar
too
i
think
that
theyr
a
lot
harder
there
are
three
issu
with
clipper
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
architectur
of
the
whole
scheme
is
capabl
of
work
my
answer
with
one
signific
except
is
ye
i
realli
do
think
that
nsa
and
nist
have
design
thi
scheme
about
a
well
a
can
be
assum
that
their
real
object
are
a
state
to
permit
wiretap
under
certain
carefullycontrol
circumst
with
a
minimum
risk
of
abus
the
except
is
that
u
exist
outsid
of
the
chip
on
a
program
diskett
that
serious
wrong
u
and
u
should
be
load
onto
the
chip
separ
to
those
who
disagre
and
i
dont
claim
my
answer
is
obviou
though
i
found
my
own
reason
suffici
persuas
that
i
wa
forc
to
rewrit
the
conclus
section
of
my
technic
analysi
paper
i
had
origin
blast
the
scheme
i
issu
thi
invit
assum
that
you
were
charg
with
implement
such
a
system
with
complet
regard
for
civil
right
and
due
process
what
would
you
do
differ
in
answer
thi
question
plea
accept
nsa
fundament
assumpt
that
both
strong
cryptographi
against
outsid
and
the
abil
to
wiretap
some
domest
user
is
necessari
if
you
feel
it
necessari
to
challeng
those
assumpt
do
it
in
the
context
of
the
last
issu
i
present
below
right
here
im
discus
just
the
technic
aspect
and
no
i
dont
by
ani
mean
claim
that
just
becaus
someth
can
be
done
it
should
be
the
second
issu
is
whether
or
not
thi
whole
architectur
is
actual
go
to
be
use
just
becaus
clipper
chip
are
made
thi
way
doesnt
mean
that
that
the
onli
way
theyll
be
made
mayb
the
nsa
will
substitut
it
own
chip
between
the
program
facil
and
the
ship
dock
and
theyll
gener
bogu
warrant
request
so
that
the
escrow
agent
dont
wonder
whi
theyv
never
call
sorri
guy
all
them
terrorist
and
drug
dealer
and
pedophil
seem
to
have
bought
tripled
phone
instead
whod
a
thunk
it
i
have
no
answer
to
thi
question
and
at
the
moment
i
dont
see
a
way
of
answer
it
those
concern
are
part
of
my
reason
in
my
answer
to
the
final
question
below
the
third
and
most
seriou
issu
is
whether
or
not
clipper
is
a
good
idea
even
if
carri
out
strictli
accord
to
the
letter
of
the
law
i
think
that
the
answer
is
no
but
it
not
a
nobrain
im
a
civil
libertarian
not
a
libertarian
for
reason
that
i
explain
at
great
length
on
the
net
in
the
elder
day
and
that
i
dont
have
the
energi
to
repeat
now
but
that
mean
that
im
will
to
accept
that
some
law
are
necessari
so
long
a
they
respect
the
essenti
right
of
individu
the
govern
alreadi
ha
the
abil
and
in
our
system
the
right
to
issu
search
warrant
and
while
that
power
ha
certainli
been
abus
it
also
been
use
quit
properli
and
fairli
in
other
case
is
key
escrow
suffici
differ
i
think
so
but
again
it
not
an
easi
question
for
me
it
is
easi
for
libertarian
to
answer
of
cours
sinc
clipper
is
complet
alien
to
much
of
the
rest
of
their
oftadmir
philosophi
and
it
also
easi
for
those
who
give
their
unreserv
trust
to
govern
a
group
im
much
more
distant
from

bellovin
