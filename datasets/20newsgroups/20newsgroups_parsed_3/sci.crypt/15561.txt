write
im
not
a
lawyer
so
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
do
that
could
be
consid
obstruct
of
justic
which
could
land
you
in
prison
for
quit
a
while
the
thing
that
great
about
the
secret
key
is
it
is
idea
encrypt
so
even
if
the
fbi
do
get
the
key
theyr
sol
unless
they
know
the
magic
word
if
they
tri
to
forc
you
to
give
them
your
pa
phrase
just
say
oop
i
forgot
sinc
the
burden
of
proof
is
still
on
the
prosecut
in
thi
countri
if
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
how
can
they
prove
that
you
didnt
forget
your
pa
phrase
ok
doug
is
right
it
would
be
obstruct
of
justic
blah
blah
blah
but
say
i
forgot
is
a
lie
which
is
just
a
bad
from
a
moral
point
of
view
if
you
think
law
is
a
good
in
and
of
itself
which
admittedli
most
peopl
do
not
but
there
an
even
better
way
out
of
thi
provid
the
govern
is
prosecut
you
crimin
you
can
probabl
plead
the
fifth
amendm
and
thu
legal
avoid
reveal
your
key
the
govern
can
not
demand
inform
from
a
crimin
defend
which
may
tend
to
incrimin
that
defend
though
thi
ha
never
been
appli
in

a
far
a
i
can
tell
it
seem
an
obviou
applic
to
me
thi
may
be
a
common
suggest
in
thi
group
but
if
it
not
im
new
here
id
love
to
hear
what
peopl
have
to
say
about
it
sinc
i
dont

sinc
the
