not
know
anyth
about
the

algorithm
it
not
realli
possibl
to

whether
thi
make
it
harder

s
whi
are

n
and
n
form
a
they
are
it
would
be
facin
to
see
the
skipjack
algorithm
to
look
for
way
of
attack
it
that
requir
three
ciphertext
block
form
in
that
odd
way
where
do
the
bit
constant

that
are
concaten

come
from
are
they
chang
from

or

even
if

time
if
skipjack
is
resist
to
knownplaintext
attack
when
use
tripl
encrypt
then
there
no
break
in

but
whi
allow
that
kind
of
weird
format
if
those
three
bit
valu
are
trulyrandom
bit
then
mayb
it
use
to
ensur
that
a

attack
on

if
it
