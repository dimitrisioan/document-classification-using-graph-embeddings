more
than

themselv
i
read
the
languag
of

releas
the
obviou

present
these
piec
to
the
public
and
i
am
sicken
i

revolt
i
am
repuls
perhap
even
of
thi
countri
could
care
le
about
the
clipper
chip
the
wiretap
bill
the
smart
card
becaus
they
are
so
entrap
in
the
rhetor
of
the
clinton
administr
the
problem
is
the
peopl
are
not
have
the
scope
or
implicataion
point
out
to
them
hell
most
havent
even
heard
of
clipper
and
when
they
do
it
will
be
in
sooth
languag
tell
everyon
how
nice
the
govern
is
at
let
them
have
privaci
how
come
the
medium
is
not
tell

yet
the

have
determin
accord
to
the
medium
that
percent
of
the

are
unawar
of
what
the

is
the
peopl
can
not

all
these

go
on
quietli
when
they
find

when
it
hit
them
it
