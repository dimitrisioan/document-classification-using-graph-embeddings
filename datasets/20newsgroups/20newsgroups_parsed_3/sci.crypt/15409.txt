it
just
occur
to
me
whi
the

is

if
it
were
publish
one
could
then
build
physic
ident
clone
version
of
the
chip
that
would
interoper
with

clipper
chip
but
the
cloner
wouldnt
provid
the
key
to
the
escrow
hous
hmmn
not
necessarili
they
could
releas
the
detail
of
the
algorithm
without
releas
the

call

that
would
