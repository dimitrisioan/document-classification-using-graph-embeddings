to

the

normal
if

i

take

then
rais

even

the

they

the

there

to
for

im

to
suggest
that
the
libertarian
posit
should
be
to
give

to
the

and
if
necessari
make
them
take
them

confess
that
thi
is

af

the

may
not
look
anyth
like
what
most
peopl
would
consid
a
straight
line
take
a
long

it
is
arguabl
that

on

could
better
lead
to
the

inde
to
the

than
would

there
the

suggest
that
the

how

if

you
should
teach

how

thi

you
on

have
often
gone
hungri
while

becaus
you

the
