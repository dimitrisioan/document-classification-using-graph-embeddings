you
write
suppos
i
knew
how
the
algorithm
work
and
knew
the
n
for
my
chip
but
did
not
know
f
then
by
cryptanalysi
i
might
be
abl
to
determin
f
from
if
law
enforc
field
eek
u
n
f
not
know
n
would
might
make
thi
much
harder
theyr
bet
that
you
cant
do
thi
even
if
you
know
n
even
if
you
know
e
in
fact
which
theyr
tri
to
keep
secret
if
you
can
find
e
by
grind
down
the
chip
presum
you
can
find
f
a
well
but
we
cant
do
thi
right
now
with
de
even
know
the
encrypt
method
without
do
almost
the
whole
bit
search
that
is
not
true
with
chosen
plaintext
attack
de
key
can
be
determin
without
the
full
search
now
suppos
that
i
know
f
either
legitim
or
not
if
i
know
k
either
becaus
i
am
involv
in
the
convers
or
i
know
u
for
a
parti
in
the
convers
i
may
now
be
abl
to
determin
u
for
the
other
parti
again
theyr
bet
that
you
cant
find
u
given
k
ie
they
claim
the
encrypt
is
strong
trust
u
i
am
not
will
to
take
that
bet
if
i
know
f
i
can
also
defeat
the
law
enforc
field
sinc
i
could
make
my
own
with
a
differ
k
then
the
one
i
am
use
know
f
also
allow
traffic
analysi
to
be
perform
so
i
might
not
know
what
you
are
say
but
i
could
know
who
you
are
say
it
too
im
not
sure
therel
be
a
way
to
shove
arbitrari
key
and
data
through
your
chip
but
if
so
thi
part
ok
were
assum
e
is
unknown
you
can
obvious
shove
arbitrari
data
through
your
chip
a
for
the
key
it
is
state
that
the
sesion
key
exchang
is
extern
to
the
chip
so
i
can
pick
my
key
too
now
i
admit
that
someon
tri
to
comput
u
will
not
have
lot
of
messag
to
work
from
but
sinc
we
have
no
way
of
know
that
the
key
gener
method
doe
not
deliber
gener
weak
key
or
for
that
matter
that
the
publish
method
is
in
fact
use
perhap
the
u
will
be
chosen
from
know
weak
key
for
the
system
they
assum
that
you
wont
be
abl
to
find
u
no
matter
how
mani
messag
you
have
if
they
could
break
u
they
wouldnt
need
the
key
escrow
bing
bing
bing
bing
bing
that
exactli
my
point
sinc
we
cant
know
that
they
do
not
have
thi
capabl
the
onli
safe
assumpt
is
that
they
do
i
admit
that
most
of
my
cryptograph
complaint
are
probabl
unfound
but
sinc
we
cant
know
one
way
or
the
other
im
not
gonig
to
take
their
word
for
it
obvious
the
compromis
of
f
would
be
a
disast
both
to
law
enforc
for
whom
thi
whole
thing
is
design
and
for
the
peopl
who
believ
that
it
is
give
them
secur
f
is
but
one
number
and
i
sure
that
alot
of
peopl
more
then
know
what
it
is
and
if
some
panel
of
expert
is
go
to
check
it
over
for
flaw
then
mani
more
will
know
f
forget
grind
chip
briberi
and
blackmail
work
just
fine
it
not
clear
that
the
expert
will
be
told
f
in
fact
id
be
surpris
id
expect
someth
more
of
the
form
of
the
fip
pub
describ
de
so
that
they
could
look
at
the
algorithm
in
gener
rather
than
with
the
specif
set
of
key
chosen
oh
come
on
that
like
say
you
could
evalu
de
without
the
sbox
