i

show
in

digest
that
it
possibl
to
prevent
the

from
read

after
their

expir
that
is
the
cop
send
the
lef
to
the
fholder
the
fholder
strip
off
f
and
send
ukn
to
the
escrow
agent
they
send
either
u
or
k
to
the
cop
don
say
u
i
say
k
the
cop
cant
use
u
in
the
futur
becaus
they
cant
strip
off
f
the
fholder
never
see
u
in
don
model
the
escrow
agent
cant
read
the
traffic
becaus
they
dont
have
k
in
my
model
they
have
k
but
not
the
messag
itself
and
i
trust
that
more
becaus
i
think
the
cop
and
the
fbi
the
fholder
are
more
like
to
collabor
on
break
the
rule
the
net
result
is
that
by
involv
the
fholder
and
the
escrow
agent
on
everi
tap
we
can
avoid
extend
permiss
