how
sensibl

de
encrypt
data
toward
bit
error
how
much
data
per

will
be
lost
in
averag
i
assum
you
still
have
the
correct
key
how
much
of
the
desencrypt

which

lead
to

sure
seem
that
some

onli
the

todd
w

if
you
use
cbc
cihper
block

then
the
remaind
of
the

will
be

axel

i
includ
the
respons
i
got
from
todd
w
arnold
in
axel
dunkel
write
how
sensibl
is
de
encrypt
data
toward
bit
error
how
much
data
per
bit
will
be
lost
in
averag
i
assum
you
still
have
the
correct
key
it
depend
on
the
mode
your
use
for
a
singl
bit
input
block
a
onebit
error
will
have
a
percent
chanc
of
corrupt
each
of
the
output
bit
in
other
word
it
essenti
turn
the
output
block
into
a
random
number
if
your
encrypt
data
in
cbc
mode
howev
onli
the
one
bit
block
will
be
affect
the
next
block
and
all
that
follow
it
will
be
decrypt
properli
it
a
good
idea
to
have
some
kind
of
error
correct
in
your
system
if
corrupt
bit
are
like
todd
from
paul
schlyter
in
articl
you
write
hello
how
sensibl
is
de
encrypt
data
toward
bit
error
how
much
data
per
bit
will
be
lost
in
averag
i
assum
you
still
have
the
correct
key
at
least
byte
of
data
will
be
destroy
if
one
bit
encrypt
data
is
in
error
if
you
use
cbc
cihper
block
chain
then
the
remaind
of
the
data
will
be
destroy
a
well
de

your

ecb
take
a

is
which
in
all
of
them
the
result
of
encrypt

affect
later
block
with
some

the

onc
one
block
is
bad
all
later
block
will
be
bad
too
there
also
the
frame
problem
if
you
have
a
bit
chang
the
block
that
it
in
chang
and
mayb
later
block
also
chang
but
if
you
have
bit
lost
or

ad
bit
in

bit
out
everyth
is

a
