re
the
secret
sourc
of
that
announc
i
guess
the
cryptowrangl
read
thi
group
too
but
of
cours
i
knew
that
becaus
it
is
so
easi
to
do
there
is
not
a
singl
doubt
in
my
mind
that
everi
byte
that
pass
everi
signific
gateway
or
bone
is
captur
for
the
collig
of
data
about
mayb
your
name
is
here
mayb
we
should
start
a
newsgroup
for
the
distribut
of
encrypt
post
intend
of
member
of
affin
group
with
a
share
privat
key
for
exampl
at
the
come
up
cypherpunk
meet
a
privat
key
correspond
to
that
particular
meet
could
be
pass
out
by
a
moder
minut
followup
comment
to
other
particip
and
so
on
could
be
post
to
the
altencrypt
group
for
the
use
of
the
peopl
who
attend
communiqu
intend
by
the
group
for
nonattende
could
of
cours
just
be
sign
use
the
privat
key
but
otherwis
not
encrypt
start
a
altencrypt
newsgroup
rather
than
just
maintain
mail
list
is
better
for
sever
reason
first
it
would
be
easier
to
archiv
for
peopl
who
might
join
a
group
late
and
who
might
like
to
easili

post
second
traffic
analysi
to
know

to
whom
an

messag
is

would
be
foil
three
a
newsgroup
is
much
more
public
and
would
serv
to
public
avail
privaci
measur
on
the

and
it
would
be
fun
to
accumul
a

give
