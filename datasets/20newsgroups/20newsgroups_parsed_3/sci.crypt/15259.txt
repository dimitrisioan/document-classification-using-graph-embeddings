c
may
write
get
the
court
order
to
reveal
the
key
also
make
decipher
all
past
convers
which
may
be
on
tape
or
disk
or
whatver
a
i
understand
the
propos
i
could
be
wrong
but
ive
seen
no
mention
of
session
key
be
the
escrow
entiti
true
in
theori
in
practic
the
technolog
of
cellular
phone
will
probabl
be
spread
spectrum
and
quit
difficult
to
record
the
crypttext
without
the
key
if
the
frequenc
path
depend
on
they
key
a
i
understand
it
to
it
could
be
made
effect
imposs
to
record
onc
it
hit
land
you
can
record
it
if
you
have
telco
access
the
telco
isnt
suppos
to
give
that
without
a
warrant
that
the
rule
today
but
even
so
the
evid
would
not
be
admiss
i
think
unless
the
judg
so
order
i
think
that
even
intercept
of
the
crypttext
without
a
warrant
would
be
illeg
cop
cant
record
today
plain
cellular
call
and
then
ask
a
judg
hey
can
we
have
permiss
to
listen
to
those
tape
can
they
wors
of
cours
if
the
govern
then
use
thi
clinton
clipper
to
argu
for
restrict
on
unapprov
encrypt
thi
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
u
i
think
the
camel
nose
in
the
tent
etc
ye
that
is
a
major
concern
but
i
think
that
they
think
they
can
win
just
by
have
of
the
usa
use
thi
system
they
dont
even
have
to
care
about
the
cautiou
that
left
they
dont
catch
the
realli
smart
crook
anyway
