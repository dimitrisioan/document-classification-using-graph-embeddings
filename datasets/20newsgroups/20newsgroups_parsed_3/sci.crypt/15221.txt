the
real
fear
come
from
them
do
more
than
thi
thi
is
a
voluntari
program
and
thu
harder
for
u
to
object
to
on
the
surfac
their
strategi
is
a
busi
one
rather
than
legal
one
they
are
push
to
get
a
standard
in
place
a
secret
standard
and
if
they
get
it
a
a
standard
then
they
will
drive
competitor
out
of
the
market
it
will
be
legal
to
sell

it
will
be
difficult
and

youll
be
abl
to
talk
to

hard

share
they

thu
there
will
be
veri
littl

the

isnt
that

now
after
all
they

from

polic
well
some
peopl
will
buy
these
phone
but
they
will
onli
work
with
other
proprietari

so
the
market
will
be
small
and
the

expens
unless
they
are
made
in
number
larg
enough
to
sell
them
cheap
onli
the

and
thi
mean
that
the

the
onli
reason
a
