if

it

to
come
up

note

the

you
believ
all
that
is
said
about
the
effect
of
the
algorithm
and
the

system
which
would
you
buy
a
chip
from

b
second

chip
from

b
with
no

in

escrow
there
would
obvious
be
power
econom
incent
for
a
second

non

but
what
about
second
sourc
for
pincompat
nonclipp
algorithm
chip
that
also
have
escrow
key
if
a
reput

produc
a
chip
with
escrow
key
that
is
a
popin
replac
for
the
clipper
chip
in
my
phone
and
us
an
algorithm
that
is
wide
known
and
evalu
and
trust
then
what
the
problem
the

is
go
to

anyway
by

we

plain

analysi

so
the

could
build

use

still
not

they
