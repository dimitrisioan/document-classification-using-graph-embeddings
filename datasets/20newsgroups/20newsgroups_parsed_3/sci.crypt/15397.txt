compani
ive
live
year
under
a
totalitarian
regim
and
boy
i
can
recogn
a
totalitarian
plot
when
i
see
one
id
be
happi
to
use
a
crypto
system
suppli
by
the
nsa
for
busi
if
they
told
me
it
wa
more
secur
than
de
and
in
particular
resist
to
i
am
sure
that
you
would
be
happi
to
use
anyth
they
tell
you
is
secur
were
talk
about
the
intellig
peopl
here
or
the
crimin
one
if
you
dont
like
the
previou
sentenc
or
those
who
dont
want
their
privaci
to
be
guarante
to
be
invad
by
the
govern
ani
current
and
futur
govern
mind
you
id
be
happi
to
do
so
even
with
escrow
key
provid
i
wa
happi
about
the
bona

of
the

agenc
the
feder

a

someth
set
up
by
one
of
the
big
account
firm
even
if
you
ignor
the
nonsens
of
the
abov
statement
for
a
moment
and
even
if
you
are
happi
with
such
system
and
the
current
escrow
agenc
now
what
guarante
that
youll
be
happi
with
them
tomorrow
when
the
govern
chang
or
when
the
current
govern
throw
away
the
sheep
skin
all
the
sheep
who
are
reason
like
you
will
get
caught
by
surpris
but
it
will
be
too
late
becaus
then
cryptographi
that
is
not
guarante
to
be
breakabl
by
the
govern
will
alreadi
have
been
outlaw
after
all
youv
alreadi
got
privaci
that
is
said
to
be
breakabl
onli
by
the
law
enforc
agenc
so
if
you
are
lawabid
you
have
no
reason
to
use
a
stronger
one
right
so
if
you
are
use
a
stronger
one
you
have
someth
to
hide
from
the
law
enforc
agenc
right
someth
unlaw
right
therefor
strong
crypto
is
a
clear
idndic
that
you
are
do
someth
unlaw
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
presid
if
they
state
there
were
no
trap
consid
the
level
of
compet
in
cryptolog
that
you
have
demonstr
in
your
messag
you
would
trust
just
anyth
and
no
thi
is
not
an
ad
hominem
attack
it
an
attack
against
the
content
of
your
messag
grin
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committe
of
independ
expert
examin
the
thing
under
seal
of
secreci
and
report
back
that
it
wa
secur
and
how
do
you
know
that
these
expert
are
not
corrupt
and
how
do
you
know
that
they
will
not
make
a
mistak
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
version
of
the
algorithm
they
will
be
let
to
examin
is
the
same
a
the
one
that
will
be
realli
use
regard
the
mistak
even
the
few
inform
they
have
let
out
ha
reveal
a
seriou
secur
hole
in
the
protocol
the
bit
key
is
split
in
two
bit
one
thu
the
whole
system
is
easili
breakabl
if
you
have
onli
one
of
the
key
id
trust
someth
from
the
nsa
long
befor
id
trust
someth
from
some
swiss
or
anybodi
japanes
the
swiss
or
the
japanes
are
motiv
by
simpl
greed
nsa
is
motiv
by
their
wish
to
control
the
peopl
that
whi
the
drug
dealer
have
their
account
in
swiss
bank
instead
of
in
american
one
for
some
reason
they
do
trust
the
swiss
bank
more
guess
theyll
trust
the
swiss
encrypt
more
too
i
see
idea
becom
suddenli
popular
thi
may
seem
surpris
to
some
here
but
i
suggest
most
corpor
would
feel
the
same
way
mostmanysom
pick
one
corpor
have
an
attitud
that
the
nsa
is
part
of
our

we
support

put
it
to
me
one
day
it
not
surpris
at
all
but
not
becaus
of
the
reason
you
give
it
becaus
it
is
obviou
that
the
u
govern
ha
put
a
lot
of
money
behind
thi
program
and
it
will
support
it
thu
most
corpor
will
tri
to
get
their
piec
from
the

by
support
it
too
the
same
good
old
greed
strong
encrypt
is
not
wide
avail
now
not
becaus
of
some
plot
but
becaus
the
compani
dont
see
much
money
in
it
it
will
be
avail
even
le
if
the
compani
can
see

just
some

yeah
just
