re
more
technic
detail
hmm
followup
on
my
own
post
well
who
care
first
let
me
tri
to
work
out
the
fact
that
we
get
to
know
about
the
clipperchip
from
what
hellman
and
den
were
abl
to
tell
u
the
chip
itself
is
not
confin
to
digit
telephoni
but
perform
gener
encrypt
in
a
symmetr
manner
the
chip
support
cfb
ofb
ecb
and
whatev
the
fourth
mode
of
oper
for
de
is
the
algorithm
consist
of
round
of
whatev
and
take
bit
key
input
data
seem
to
be
bit
ye
so
if
two
peopl
want
secur
commun
whatev
that
mean
when
clipper
is
involv
they
have
first
to
agre
on
one
secret
key
or
is
it
one
key
per
direct
they
can
exchang
thi
key
via
dhscheme
or
howev
somehow
the
two
feed
their
so
won
secret
key
into
the
clipperchip
which
is
now
readi
to
work
the
clipper
chip
carri
an
uniqu
serialnumb
bit
and
keybit
these
keybit
seem
to
have
been
gain
by
encrypt
the
serialnumb
with
seedbit
the
seedbit
seem
not
to
be
store
in
the
chip
at
begin
of
commun
and
perhap
at
certain
invterv
whithin
befor
send
the
fist
real
bit
output
of
the
first
encrypt
the
clipper
chip
put
out
packet
i
guess
which
repres
the
serial
number
and
the
session
key
thi
might
look
like
x
ek
chipkeykk
serial
number
where
x
is
a
transform
of
these
packet
involv
a
familykey
thi
familyspkey
is
equal
for
all
chip
x
might
be
a
simpl
xor
after
that
the
digit
phonecal
can
be
done
a
usual
everi
packet
be
encrypt
and
decrypt
by
clipper
den
describ
how
k
and
k
shall
be
gener
use
a
seed
of
bit
now
leav
alon
polit
which
doe
not
concern
me
a
much
a
you
not
be
an
american
citicientm
there
are
some
weak
point
in
thi
scheme
which
might
be
exploit
by
sever
parti
a
far
a
i
know
about
the
gener
of
kk
s
and
s
look
like
the
obviou
backdoor
they
could
be
use
to
gener
the
chipkey
by
know
the
serialnumb
and
also
the
familykey
of
the
chip
i
realli
cant
imagin
whi
these
seed
would
be
need
otherwis
a
true
randomsourc
for
the
gener
of
the
kk
can
be
bought
for
not
to
much
money
then
the
escrow
each
of
them
will
get
bit
of
a
bit
key
secur
could
a
littl
a
exist
be
maxim
by
give
them
bit
each
which
have
to
be
xore
togeth
to
give
the
kk
now
let
simpli
assum
the
escrow
are
trustworthi
and
cant
be
fool
by
crimin
or
law
enforchemnt
agenc
and
there
will
be
no
quarrel
between
escrow
and
lea
which
would
hinder
the
lea
in
do
their
duti
and
so
on
and
so
on
onc
the
key
are
surrend
the
correspond
chip
is
compromis
forev
not
veri
clever
imho
how
about
send
in
the
encrypt
sessionkey
for
each
phonecal
that
the
polic
or
whoever
want
to
listen
to
escrow
could
then
simpli
decod
thi
sessionkey
and
send
it
back
to
polic
and
would
natur
not
do
thi
after
the
warrant
ha
expir
thi
would
be
a
better
technic
solut
but
i
guess
polit
will
not
work
that
way
appar
a
miss
den
state
the
onli
one
perform
actual
decod
of
intercept
messag
shall
be
the
fbi
great
so
local
guy
can
not
inter
cept
understand
your
traffic
anymor
doe
thi
mean
that
the
fbi
monopol
the
right
to
do
legal
wiretap
how
is
law
over
there
i
have
no
idea
who
is
allow
to
tap
and
who
not
thi
certainli
mean
that
watch
communi
cation
will
be
rout
automat
from
the
serviceprovid
compani
to
the
fbi
if
the
communicaiton
is
a
watch
one
and
thi
mean
a
far
a
i
understand
it
that
the
familykey
ha
to
be
known
by
each
switch
compani
and
those
provid
cellularphon
servi
etcetc
so
the
familykey
will
not
be
veri
secret
and
thu
serialnumb
of
call
will
be
readabl
by
anybodi
who
care
i
like
trafficanalysi
what
do
you
guess
what
happen
if
you
use
the
chip
in
ecb
mode
and
the
first
few
packet
of
the
chip
are
somehow
lost
or
garbl
so
the
session
key
would
not
be
actual
broadcast
over
the
line
hmmm
shouldnt
be
so
difficult
to
do
that
and
now
a
last
point
for
the
other
side
after
all
i
have
read
and
heard
about
clipper
not
the
program
languag
for
dbase
is
it
it
seem
to
have
mani
advantag
which
shold
not
be
overseen
now
an
afterthought
to
your
right
plea
note
that
i
have
no

am

if
thi

in

freedom

mayb
you
