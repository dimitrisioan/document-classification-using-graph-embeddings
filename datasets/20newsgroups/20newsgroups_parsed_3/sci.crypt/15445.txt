oh
great
wonder
news
nobodi
can
listen
inexcept
the
fed
hey
it
better
than
the
statu
quo
i
am
far
le
worri
about
the
fed
tap
my
phone
than
high
school
scanner
surfer
who
get
their
kick
out
of
eavesdrop
on
cellular
and
cordless
phone
call
im
a
polit
dissid
im
scare
shitless
of
the
fed
listen
in
on
my
call
my
opinion
are
the
sort
that
would
get
me
disappear
in
a
slightli
le
free
societi
and
who
know
what
sort
of
societi
we
will
be
in
in
five
or
ten
year
i
have
friend
who
have
had
their
phone
tap
none
of
thi
is
theoret
to
me
a
for
it
better
than
the
statu
quo
well
first
of
all
you
can
get
a
cryptophon
from
compani
like
cylink
today
and
they
work
well
in
addit
a
number
of
group
are
now
work
on
build
softwar
to
turn
ani
pc
into
a
privaci
enhanc
phone
right
now
and
they
are
all
work
in
overdr
mode
and
ye
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto
restrict
lift
but
thi
is
at
least
an
incremement
improv
for
certain
applic
there
are
no
crypto
restrict
yet
you
can
use
anyth
you
want
right
now
the
point
is
to
maintain
that
right
the
point
you
all
seem
to
have
miss
wa
cover
when
the
uk
cellphon
scrambl
system
wa
discus
incident
my
mp
ha
respond
to
my
question
on
that
issu
and
it
appear
that
the
uk
and
other
approv
countri
will
get
the
secur
a
encrypt
and
dodgi
countri
will
get
ax
exist
mobil
equip
will
drop
to
clear
mode
when
use
with
ax
system
but
newer
equip
will
use
aaxclear
depend
on
the
capabl
of
the
base
station
the
copsf
do
not
need
to
be
abl
to
get
hold
of
your
privat
key
to
listen
in
to
cellular
convers
encrypt
is
not
endtoend
but
cellphon
to
basest
it
ha
to
be
thi
way
so
that
cellular
user
and
fix
instal
can
talk
to
each
other
for
cellular
to
cellular
call
the
transmiss
is
decrypt
at
the
basest
pas
to
anoth
basest
and
reencrypt
the
copsf
can
listen
to
the
unscrambl
call
provid
they
get
a
warrant
to
tap
into
the
cellular
provid
equip
the
onli
reason
for
want
a
crackabl
system
is
so
they
can
listen
without
have
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
mayb
the
clipper
system
is
secur
and
they
realli
do
need
a
warrant
to
get
the
key
out
of
escrow
befor
they
can
listen
in
use
a
scanner
see
abov
they
dont
have
to
go
down
thi
rout
anyway
i
have
my
doubt
but
even
if
true
onc
they
have
the
key
they
will
never
again
need
a
warrant
to
tap
into
that
particular
phone
whenev
they
want
well
judg
it
appear
he
wasnt
a
drugdeal
after
all
so
natur
well
stop
listen
in
you
have
everi
reason
to
be
scare
shitless
take
a
look
at
the
record
of
mccarthi
hoover
j
edgar
not
the
cleaner
though
they
both
excel
at
suck
and
