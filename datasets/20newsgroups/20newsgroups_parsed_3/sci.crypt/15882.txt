how
to
make
the
clipper
chip
and
wiretap
le
bad
ive
got
an
idea
that
would
remov
most
of
the
polit
complaint
i
have
about
the
clipper
chip
pa
a
law
state
that
if
within
a
year
of
performa
a
wiretap
on
someon
a
polic
agenc
hasnt
manag
to
convict
the
suspect
of
the
crime
the
warrantwiretap
wa
for
then
that
agenc
owe
the
suspect
million
to
repay
himher
for
lost
privaci
of
cours
there
are
still
problem
with
the
technic
aspect
of
clipper
and
with
the
onesizefitsal
mental
that
would
be
behind
an
attempt
to
enforc
it
a
a
standard
but
thi
would
be
a
way
for
those
in
favor
of
allow
continu
wiretap
to
assur
u
that
it
will
onli
be
use
in
case
where
the
crime
is
import
and
the
polic
are
all
but
certain
that
there
realli
will
be
a
convict
