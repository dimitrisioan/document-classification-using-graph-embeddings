the
copsf
do
not
need
to
be
abl
to
get
hold
of
your
privat
key
to
listen
in
to
cellular
convers
encrypt
is
not
endtoend
but
cellphon
to
basest
it
ha
to
be
thi
way
so
that
cellular
user
and
fix
instal
can
talk
to
each
other
for
cellular
to
cellular
call
the
transmiss
is
decrypt
at
the
basest
pass
to
anoth
basest
and
reencrypt
the
copsf
can
listen
to
the
unscrambl
call
provid
they
get
a
warrant
to
tap
into
the
cellular
provid
equip
the
onli
reason
for
want
a
crackabl
system
is
so
they
can
listen
without
have
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
mayb
the
clipper
system
is
secur
and
they
realli
do
need
a
warrant
to
get
the
key
out
of
escrow
befor
they
can
listen
in
use
a
scanner
see
abov
they
dont
have
to
go
down
thi
rout
anyway
i
have
my
doubt
but
even
if
true
onc
they
have
the
key
they
will
never
again
need
a
warrant
to
tap
into
that
particular
phone
whenev
they
want
well
judg
it
appear
he
wasnt
a
drugdeal
after
all
so
natur
well
stop
listen
in
that
wa
true
for
the
uk
paul
but
im
fairli
sure
theyr
talk
about
build
endtoend
encrypt
phone
out
of
thi
chip
it
not
for
cellular
though
it
certainli
could
be
use
there
in
the
way
you
suggest
