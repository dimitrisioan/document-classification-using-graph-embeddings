april
the
chip
are
program
by
mykotronx
inc
which
call
them
the
myk
the
silicon
is
suppli
by
vlsi
technolog
inc
all
clipper
chip
are
program
insid
a
scif
secur
compart
inform
facil
which
is
essenti
a
vault
the
scif
contain
a
laptop
comput
and
equip
to
program
the
chip
about
chip
are
program
dure
a
singl
session
the
scif
is
locat
at
mykotronx
acknowledg
and
distribut
notic
thi
articl
is
base
on
inform
provid
by
nsa
nist
fbi
and
mykotronx
permiss
to
distribut
thi
document
is
grant
so
who
is
mykotronx
inc
it
would
be
nice
to
know
that
they
were
not
a
front
compani
use
by
an
intellig
or
other
agenc
of
the
u
govern
trust
the
fox
to
guard
the
chicken
and
all
that
seem
suspici
when
the
rest
of
the
sourc
are
fox
while
we
are
at
it
the
chip
design
should
be
examin
and
verifi
against
silicon
to
insur
no
trap
door
or
hidden
protocol
exist
in
silicon
regardless
of
the
secur
level
of
the
encrypt
algorithm
it
would
be
a
shame
if
some
three
letter
agenc
had
the
abil
to
interrog
my
chip
when
all
id
know
is
that
someon
rang
and
when
i
attempt
to
go
off
hook
the
line
went
dead
could
be
even
wors
if
the
chip
were
intend
to
connect
directli
to
a
modem
the
design
examin
should
be
done
to
the
gate
level
doe
anyon
have
a
good
idea
how
to
tell
if
there
is
a
piggyback
design
on
silicon
the
model
would
be
extra
logic
share
pin
with
the
advertis
function
tip
off
would
be
circuitri
that
would
ignor
incom
data
if
format
or
sequenc
is
not
right
i
can
think
of
onli
two
way
an
output
pin
could
be
use
and
it
possibl
that
might
be
notic
but
could
be
edit
from
the
netlist
i
think
the
silicon
itself
need
to
be
investig
imagin
a
design
done
in
two
layer
metal
yet
find
a
third
layer
under
the
microscop
the
govern
is
ask
for
a
lot
of
blind
trust
the
encrypt
algorithm
oper
protocol
the
agenc
have
physic
control
of
the
devic
the
silicon
implement
id
feel
like
keep
one
hand
on
my
wallet
