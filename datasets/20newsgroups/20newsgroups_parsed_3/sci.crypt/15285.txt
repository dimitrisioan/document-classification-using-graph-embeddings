how
doe
it
realli
work
wa
re
text
of
white
hous
announc
and
qa
on
clipper
chip
encrypt
thi
announc
is
somewhat
disconcert
it
doesnt
do
anyth
evil
in
and
of
itself
but
bode
badli
for
the
futur
of
open
algorithm
and
standard
in
inform
secur
i
wont
start
panick
untilunless
de
or
rsa
or
stuff
like
that
is
prohibit
but
im
a
littl
anxiou
no
doubt
it
wont
be
long
befor
someon
post
explain
how
thi
just
a
small

my
feel
is
that
the
administr
probabl
isnt
that
worri
about
thing
like
de
and
rsa
and
pgp
and
ripem
sinc
theyll
never
be
use
by
a
group
much
wider
than
u
comput
geek
the
fact
that
thi
just
came
out
now
suggest
one
of
two
thing
the
nsa
ha
been
work
on
thi
for
a
long
time
and
it
onli
just
now
happen
to
be
readi
to
releas
to
the
world
at
thi
time
the
nsa
ha
been
work
on
thi
for
a
long
time
but
wasnt
abl
to
get
the
bush
administr
to
go
along
with
thi
plan
i
find
it
unlik
that
thi
would
have
been
becaus
of
a
sympathi
for
the
unescrow
use
of
cryptographi
more
like
the
administr
felt
that
even
escrow
secretalgorithm
and
for
all
we
know
trivial
breakabl
cryptographi
should
not
be
made

the
major
of
the
discus
involv
thi
clipper
chip
seem
to
pertain
to
the
encrypt
of
telephon
convers
doe
anyon
know
if
that
mean
thi
chip
is
design
to
work
primarili
with
analog
signal
the
languag
sort
of
suggest
thi
but
it
hard
to
say
the
main
thing
i
just
dont
get
is
whether
thi
chip
implement
symmetr
or
asymmetr
cryptograph
techniqu
anybodi
know
im
guess
symmetr
but
they
dont
get
veri
clear
about
it
if
it
is
symmetr
how
is
it
use
for
anyth
other
than
linklevel
encrypt
with
an
ident
chip
at
each
end
how
can
you
negoti
a
persess
key
use
symmetr
cryptographi
without
use
a
trust
third
parti
who
know
your
key
or
doe
it
even
use
a
persess
key
if
it
asymmetr
what
about
pkp
patent
which
they
claim
cover
all
method
of
do
asymmetr
cryptographi
are
they
get
