subject
thought
and
question
i
just
join
thi
group
recent
and
realli
do
not
know
much
about
cryptographi
but
a
coupl
thing
came
to
mind
while
read
through
the
post
is
the
clipper
chip
go
to
be
export
if
not
how
will
peopl
commun
with
other
countri
will
they
have
to
do
that
in
uncryptmod
will
other
encrypt
techniqu
be
legal
assum
the
govern
crack
down
on
use
other
when
go
oversea
but
not
within
the
state
ive
read
about
authent
system
that
use
an
electron
secur
card
that
look
like
a
calcul
to
creat
an
encrypt
pin
base
on
the
timed
the
host
system
ha
the
algorithm
built
into
it
a
well
so
that
it
can
authent
a
user
is
there
some
form
of
encrypt
technolog
that
would
creat
key
that
are
onli
valid
at
a
certain
instant
in
time
the
system
would
then
allow
a
window
of
time
around
thi
instant
where
the
key
would
work
i
realiz
that
thi
techniqu
would
increas
the
amount
of
inform
need
to
be
store
becaus
you
would
need
entir
algorithm
rather
than
just
key
but
for
smaller
scale
thing
it
might
work
could
some
similar
method
be
use
to
make
the
two
bit
key
that
are
issu
to
policefbietc
to
tap
a
phone
onli
usabl
for
oneweek
for
instanc
if
further
surveil
wa
need
they
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
escrow
servic
to
get
anoth
key
thi
would
make
it
useless
for
local
polic
to
databas
key
they
have
use
i
assum
thi
is
not
possibl
becaus
the
receiv
phone
would
need
to
be
abl
to
decyph
the
messag
but
