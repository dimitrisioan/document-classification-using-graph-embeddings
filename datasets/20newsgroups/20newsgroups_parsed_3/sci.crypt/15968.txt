write
ive
recent
been
read
a
paper
of
merkl
publixh
onli
on
the
net
i
think
discus
three
potenti
replac
for
de
wa
anyt
ever
done
with
these
are
khufu
khafr
andor
snefru
still
be
discus
anywher
i
know
snefru
is
referenc
in
the
rsa
faq
and
i
think
it
may
also
be
in
the
scicrypt
faq
the
paper
wa
distribut
against
the
wish
of
the
nsa
i
have
a
copi
with
a
few
illicit
distribut
footnot
scribbl
on
it
and
eventu
publish
at
one
of
the
crypto
confer
thing
were
look
good
then
xerox
patent
the
algorithm
plonk
i
dont
know
of
anyth
which
use
them
also
khafr
wa
broken
at
a
later
confer
and
from
work
on
a
relat
algorithm
i
dont
think
the
exist
khufu
would
hold
up
too
well
against
a
convert
differenti
cryptanalysi
attack
although
it
can
probabl
be
chang
to
resist
thi
type
of
attack
peter
in
case
you
dont
know
what
the
plonk
is
about
check
the
new
