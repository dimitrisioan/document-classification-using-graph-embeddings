im
sure
you
can
see
the
flaw
in
thi
logic
if
the
naiv
market
is
flood
with
proprietari

weak
encrypt
then
truli
strong
encrypt
will
be
unabl
to

thi
is
true
for
the
mass
market
but
not
for
those
who
need
strong
crypto
and
are
will
to
pay

can
buy
strong
crypto
today
if

to
spend

is
not

most
worth
worri
about
is
that
after
the

cheap
secur

for

is
a
polit
