point
of
attack
clipper
infrastructur
my
earlier
argument
that
clipper
will
encourag
state
and
local
cop
to
commit
crimin
act
is
larg
moot
now
that
weve
learn
that
the
fbi
will
perform
the
actual
tap
it
will
encourag
the
fbi
to
commit
even
more
crimin
act
but
that
not
the
point
here
but
thi
give
anoth
avenu
of
attack
on
the
clipper
propos
when
the
effaclucpsr
foia
request
are
made
they
should
ask
for
detail
on
the
bureaucrat
and
equip
infrastructur
that
is
propos
or
even
alreadi
budget
for
the
fbi
to
servic
tap
request
for
now
and
the
project
futur
from
these
figur
estim
the
number
of
clippertap
request
the
fbi
is
expect
publish
thi
figur
compar
it
on
a
percapita
basi
with
the
amount
of
tap
now
known
or
suspect
also
estim
how
expens
it
would
be
for
the
fbi
to
instal
more
clippertap
station
and
how
rapidli
they
could
be
built
and
instal
ie
get
the
plu

minu
epsilon
for

futur
might
be
a

disturb
for

and

all
the

detail
btw
thank
to
those
whove
been

we
still
dont
know
how
the

request
will
be
transmit
and
authent
though
it
isnt
too
hard
to
guess
a
good
scheme
how
the
