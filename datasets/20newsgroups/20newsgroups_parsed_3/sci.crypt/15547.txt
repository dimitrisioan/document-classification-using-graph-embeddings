therefor
a
i
have
said
a
new
princ
in
a
newli
acquir
state
ha
alway
taken
measur
to
arm
hi
subject
and
histori
is
full
of
exampl
prove
that
thi
is
so
but
when
a
princ
take
posess
of
a
new
state
which
he
annex
a
an
addit
to
hi
origin
domain
then
he
must
disarm
all
the
subject
of
the
new
state
except
those
who
help
him
to
acquir
it
and
these
a
time
and
occas
permit
he
must
seek
to
render
soft
and
weak
he
must
arrang
matter
in
such
a
way
that
the
arm
of
the
entir
state
will
be
in
the
hand
of
soldier
who
are
nativ
to
hi
origin
domain
and
sinc
the
subject
demand
it
i
will
not
fail
to
remind
ani
princ
who
ha
acquir
a
new
state
by
the
aid
of

inhabit
that
he
soundli
consid
what
induc
them
to
assist
him
if
the
reason
is
not
natur
affect
for
him
but
rather
dissatisfact
with
the
former
govern
he
will
find
it
extrem
difficult
to
keep
them
friendli
for
it
will
be
imposs
to
pleas
them
if
he
will
care
think
the
matter
through
in
the
light
of
exampl
drawn
from
ancient
and
modern
affair
he
will
understand
whi
it
is
much
easier
to
win
the
favor
of
those
who
were
happi
with
their
former
govern
and
henc
were
hi
enemi
than
to
keep
the
favor
of
those
who
out
of
dissatisfact
with
the
former
rule
help
him
to
replac
it
