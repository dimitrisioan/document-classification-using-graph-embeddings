idea
for
ibm
system
ive
been
think
about
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
make
pgp
avail
in
some
form
on
ebcdic
machin
the
messag
authent
would
be
ugli
but
i
think
at
least
the
idea
encrypt
could
work
if
pgp
had
a
switch
to
tell
it
to
use
idea
in
ofbmod
or
ecbmod
in
ofbmod
error
in
translat
ebcdicasciiebcd
would
onli
affect
their
byte
not
the
byte
that
would
be
affect
under
cbc
is
pgp
set
up
to
use
differ
idea
mode
i
dont
recal
notinc
it
in
the
execut
but
i
havent
gone
through
it
a
