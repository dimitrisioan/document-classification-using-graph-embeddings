normal
id
be
the
last
to
argu
with
steve
but
shouldnt
that
read
year
for
all
solut
i
mean
if
we
can
imagin
the
machin
that
doe
trialnanosecond
we
can
imagin
the
storag
medium
that
could
index
and
archiv
it
hmmmm
i
think
with
realli
larg
keyspac
like
thi
you
need
to
alter
the
strategi
discuss
for
de
attempt
decrypt
of
sever
block
and
check
the
disctribut
of
the
content
i
dont
think
it
at
all
feasibl
to
keep
encrypt
of
a
known
plaintext
block
on
ani
amount
of
tape
or
cdrom
and
certainli
not
such
encrypt
block
anyon
know
a
cheap
way
of
convert
everi
atom
in
the
solar
system
into
a
one
bit
storag
devic
i
dont
claim
to
be
a
crypto
analyist
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
good
literatur
on
the
subject
and
the
best
peopl
dont
seem
to
publish
their
work
but
i
rather
doubt
the
approach
such
folk
use
is
brute
forc
sorri
to
have
impli
that
in
my
previou
post
the
histori
of
these
thing
is
folk
find
clever
way
of
limit
the
search
and
bang
from
there
i
guess
my
real
problem
with
skipjack
is
i
can
not
believ
nsa
would
make
publicli
avail
a
system
they
couldnt
break
if
they
want
it
just
isnt
in
their
charter
rememb
de
came
from
ibm
not
nsa
and
when
first
publish
wa
given
a
use
life
of
year
i
think
we
are
well
past
that
point
now
rememb
base
on
the
size
of
the
nsa
budget
they
spend
a
lot
more
on
the
technolog
of
decrypt
than
most
comput
compani
spend
on
rd
i
have
to
imagin
their
stuff
is
real
interest
a
friend
who
onc
work
for
them
he
is
dead
now
said
he
alway
enjoy
monitor
sac
strateg
air
command
crypto
traffic
and
i
rather
suspect
that
stuff
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
skipjack
or
wa
it
the
militari
got
the
stuff
from
the
nsa
just
like
we
get
skipjack
from
them
btw
folk
nsa
wasnt
be
given
the
key
and
the
walker
spi
case
show
for
some
of
the

the
