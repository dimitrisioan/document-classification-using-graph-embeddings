keyesc
in
articl
write
i
thought
it
wa
quit
difficult
to
record
a
modem
session
at
some
intermedi
point
on
the
line
mayb
they
have
taken
a
crash
cours
in
data
comm
and
have
a
unit
that
demodul
the
tone
and
store
the
digit
stream
for
decrypt
later
thi
would
still
suffer
from
the
call
babt
it
ha
been
state
either
here
or
in
the
uktelecom
group
that
they
will
not
approv
equip
that
doe
encrypt
i
dont
know
if
thi
is
true
or
not
but
thi
would
make
a
good
test
case
peter
iliev
you
forget
the
obviou
if
it
is
an
authoris
tap
then
it
can
be
done
at
the
exchang
if
the
exchang
is
digit
then
i
suspect
that
you
can
automonitor
a
line
and
pickup
the
full
link
therefor
sync
a
piggyback
modem
on
the
line
would
not
be
imposs
i
suspect
