onc
tap
your
code
is
no
good
ani
more
in
articl
write
and
some
peopl
thought
that
i
am
exagger
when
claim
that
the
crippl
chip
is
just
a
first
step
in
a
totalitarian
plot
against
the
civil
liberti
in
the
usa
it
seem
that
ive
even
been
an
optimist
the
thing
are
happen
even
faster
than
i
expect
that
anoth
of
the
dirti
trick
they
use
to
appli
on
u
under
the
communist
regim
do
someth
secret
then
tell
the
peopl
about
is
after
the
fact
when
noth
can
be
done
ani
more
and
of
cours
explain
them
how
much
better
the
situat
is
now
in
my
previou
messag
i
wrote
that
the
american
should
wake
up
and
fight
against
the
new
propos
now
it
seem
to
me
that
it
is
alreadi
too
late
it
ha
alreadi
happen
the
civil
liberti
have
been
violat
no
stollen
from
the
american
peopl
while
the
most
part
of
thi
peopl
ha
been
sleep
happili
too
sad
a
one
of
the
happili
sleep
peopl
i
would
just
like
to
ask
thi
arent
peopl
just
slightli
overreact
to
thi
or
are
we
all
of
a
sudden
go
to
draw
parallel
to
nazi
germani
and
communist
russia
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
ye
thi
is
a
seriou
problem
but
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
guess
what
were
do
someth
now
you
cant
do
in
a
communist
countri
or
nazi
germani
were
complain
about
it
or
rather
your
complain
about
it
and
nobodi
is
shoot
at
u
or
rather
if
theyr
shoot
at
me
they
have
real
bad
aim
guess
what
peopl
you
live
in
one
of
the
few
countri
in
the
world
where
a
person
can
complain
without
get
shot
at
peopl
are
alway
complain
that
somebodi
did
thi
wrong
or
somebodi
did
that
wrong
or
whatev
sit
down
and
figur
out
two
thing
what
have
they
done
right
how
much
wors
can
it
get
and
youll
find
that
you
and
i
are
pretti
damn
lucki
so
let
talk
about
it
get
some
action
go
decid
what
go
on
but
let
not
overreact
