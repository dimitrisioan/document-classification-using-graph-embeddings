are
chip
which
perform
the
voic
compressionexpans
they
cant
be
expens
becaus
they
exist
in
mani
phone
connect
to

or
on
the
pbx
line
card
a
well
a
in
a
lot
of
equip
which
compress

circuit
to
save
the
cost
of
longdist
lea
t
or
satellit
circuit
i
cant
rememb
the
gener
term
for
these
chip
my
impress
is
that
thi
wa
a
big
deal
year
ago
but
circuit
have
gotten
so
cheap
that
it
isnt
done
much
now

squeez
them
down
vbi
i
play
around
with
the
lossless
shorten
program
last
night
but
it
onli
manag
ive
got
some
specimen
celp
code
but
it
not
obviou
that
it
run
in
real
time
i
think
it
just
proofof
concept
code
and
i
have
some
muck
about
with
file
format
to
do
befor
i
can
put
my
own
sampl
through
it
look
like
the
current
option
is
to
use
a
voicemail
modem
with
builtin
dsp
chip
to
do
thi
in
hardwar
that
mean
two
modem
for
a
system
put
the
cost
at
upward

do
it
in
softwar
on
highpow
