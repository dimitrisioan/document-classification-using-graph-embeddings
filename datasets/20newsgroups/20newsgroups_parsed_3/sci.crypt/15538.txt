re
wh
propos
from
polic
point
of
view
in
articl
dwight
tuinstra
write
it
might
pay
to
start
look
at
what
thi
propos
might
mean
to
a
polic
agenc
it
just
might
be
a
bad
idea
for
them
too
ok
suppos
the
ny
state
polic
want
to
tap
a
suspect
phone
they
need
a
warrant
just
like
the
old
day
but
unlik
the
old
day
they
now
need
to
a
get
two
feder
agenc
to
give
them
the
two
part
of
the
key
now
what
happen
if
there
a
tiff
between
the
two
escrow
hous
posessionreleas
of
key
becom
a
polit
bargain
chit
while
i
think
it
is
unrealist
to
suppos
that
the
feder
agenc
will
fail
to
promptli
compli
with
a
court
order
there
is
still
a
good
point
here
local
law
enforc
will
be
unabl
to
perform
a
wiretap
without
bring
in
feder
agenc
base
on
the
possibl
incomplet
understand
of
the
system
quot
from
d
den
onli
the
fbi
will
be
abl
to
decrypt
the
system
key
encrypt
layer
which
seem
to
be
need
even
to
identifi
what
escrow
key
to
request
thi
move
a
great
deal
of
law
enforc
power
to
the
feder
level
the
reason
i
like
thi
point
is
that
it
may
sway
or
even
persuad
peopl
who
dont
gener
line
up
with
the
civil
liberti
crowd
a
nation
polic
forc
is
oppos
by
peopl
from
a
broad
rang
of
polit
viewpoint
