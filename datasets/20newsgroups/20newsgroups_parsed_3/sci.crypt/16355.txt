stuff
ok
if
youv
read
thi
group
for
a
while
you
know
all
about
the
onetimepad
but
here
a
question
i
havent
seen
the
onetimepad
yeild
ideal
secur
but
ha
a
wellknown
flaw
in
authent
suppos
you
use
a
random
bit
stream
a
the
pad
and
exclusiveor
a
the
encrypt
oper
if
an
adversari
know
the
plaintext
of
a
messag
he
can
chang
it
into
ani
other
messag
here
how
it
work
alic
is
send
bob
a
plaintext
p
under
a
key
stream
s
alic
comput
the
ciphertext
c
s
xor
p
and
send
it
to
bob
eve
know
the
plainext
p
but
want
the
messag
to
appear
a
p
eve
intercept
c
and
comput
c
c
xor
p
xor
p
s
xor
p
eve
send
c
to
bob
bob
decrypt
c
by
comput
cxor
s
p
thu
receiv
the
fals
messag
which
wa
substitut
by
eve
now
the
question
is
how
can
thi
attack
be
defeat
with
inform
theoret
secur
not
just
comput
secur
can
we
defin
someth
like
ideal
authent
which
is
the
analog
of
ideal
secur
can
we
obtain
ideal
authent
if
not
how
much
can
we
limit
eve
control
over
the
messag
if
we
can
achiev
ideal
authent
doe
the
solut
use
more
key
bit
or
expand
the
messag
can
we
show
the
solut
to
be
optim
in
one
or
more
paramet
doe
anyon
know
if
these
question
have
been
aswer
