subject
the
escrow
databas
here
is
a
disturb
thought
now
we
no
longer
live
in
the
day
of
big
file
cabinet
we
live
in
the
electron
age
i
ask
myself
how
big
could
the
escrow
databas
get
how
hard
might
it
be
to
steal
the
whole
thing
particularli
were
i
an
nsa
offici
oper
with
the
tacit
permiss
of
the
escrow
hous
we
can
pretend
that
such
will
not
happen
but
that
naiv
well
let
see
ten
byte
of
each
escrow
half
let
asum
ten
byte
of
serial
number
in
fact
i
believ
the
serial
number
is
smaller
but
thi
is
an
order
of
magnitud
calcul
we
assum
a
the
popul
and
that
each
person
ha
a
key
i
get
five
gigabyt
for
each
of
the
two
escrow
databas
fit
conveni
on
a
singl
veri
valuabl
exabyt
tape
thi
can
onli
get
easier
with
time
but
who
care
i
can
alreadi
hold
all
the
clipper
key
in
the
countri
in
my
pocket
on
two
mm
tape
admitt
they
will
think
of
safeguard
they
wont
put
the
whole
databas
on
one
disk
prehap
mayb
they
will
throw
stumbl
block
in
the
way
thi
chang
noth
they
key
will
be
need
everi
day
by
hundr
if
not
thousand
of
law
enforc
type
so
conveni
will
dictat
that
the
system
permit
quick
electron
retriev
at
some
point
with
or
without
collus
by
the
agenc
those
exabyt
tape
are
go
to
get
cut
dorothi
den
and
david
sternlight
will
doubtless
claim
thi
cant
happen
but
we
know
that
cant
is
a
prayer
not
a
word
that
in
thi
instanc
connot
realism
with
two
exabyt
tape
in
your
pocket
you
would
hold
the
key
for
everi
person
convers
in
the
countri
in
your
hand
yeah
you
need
the
master
key
two
but
that
just
ten
byte
of
inform
that
have
to
be
store
an
aw
lot
of
place
come
to
think
of
it
even
if
the
nsa
get
a
copi
of
the
databas
isnt
a
threat
to
you
becaus
unlik
me
you
have
no
contraversi
polit
view
consid
foreign
intellig
servic
you
know
the
one
that
david
sternlight
want
to
protect
u
from
becaus
of
the
evil
industri
espionag
that
they
do
the
french
appar
do
have
a
big
spi
oper
in
friendli
countri
to
get
industri
secret
so
he
isnt
be
complet
irrat
here
although
whi
our
compani
couldnt
use
cryptosystem
without
back
door
is
left
unexplain
by
those
that
point
out
thi
threat
presum
foreign
intellig
servic
can
get
mole
into
the
nsa
and
other
agenc
we
have
proof
by
exampl
of
thi
it
happen
mani
time
presum
someday
they
will
get
their
hand
on
some
fraction
of
the
key
you
cant
avoid
that
sort
of
thing
dont
pretend
that
no
one
unauthor
will
ever
get
their
hand
on
the
escrow
databas
we
crypto
type
are
all
taught
someth
veri
import
at
the
begin
of
intro
to
cryptographi
secur
must
depend
on
the
easili
chang
key
that
you
pick
to
run
your
system
and
not
on
a
secret
the
escrow
databas
arent
the
sort
of
secret
that
our
teacher
told
u
about
but
they
are
the
sort
of
big
secret
they
would
lump
into
thi
categori
imagin
tri
to
replac
million
clipper
chip
i
can
not
believ
that
the
nsa
or
whomev
it
is
that
do
thi
doesnt
realiz
all
thi
alreadi
they
are
too
smart
there
are
too
mani
of
them
who
have
made
their
bone
in
the
real
world
i
suspect
that
they
know
precis
what
they
are
do
and
that
what
they
are
do
is
give
u
the
appear
of

so
that
they
can
continu
to
surveil
in
spite
of
the
growth
of
strong
cryptographi
i
suspect
that
they
realiz
that
they
cant
put
thing
off
forev
but
they
can
tri
to
delay

a
long
a

who
know

even
some
of
the

up
the
inevit

type
that

do
believ
