write
their
strategi
is
a
busi
one
rather
than
legal
one
they
are
push
to
get
a
standard
in
place
a
secret
standard
and
if
they
get
it
a
a
standard
then
they
will
drive
competitor
out
of
the
market
it
will
be
legal
to
sell
better
untap
encrypt
that
doesnt
have
regist
key
but
it
will
be
difficult
and
thu
not
a
plan
for
most
phone
compani
if
brad
analysi
is
correct
it
may
offer
an
explan
for
whi
the
encrypt
algorithm
is
be
kept
secret
thi
will
prevent

the

brad
describ
will
onli
work
a

a
the
onli
way
to

is
to
have
one
with

it
would
be
nice
from

peopl
still
have
the
power
to
provid
their

in

privaci
is
still
possibl
but
the
word
of
sever

make
me
doubt
