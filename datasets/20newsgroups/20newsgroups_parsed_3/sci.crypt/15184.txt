of
justic
which

for
quit
a
while
the
thing
that
great
about

secret
key
is
it
is
idea
encrypt
so
even
if
the
fbi
do
get
the
key
theyr
sol
unless
they
know
the
magic
word
if
they
tri
to
forc
you
to
give
them
your
pas
phrase
just
say
oop
i
forgot
sinc
the
burden
of
proof
is
still
on
the
prosecut
in
thi
countri
if
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
how
can
they
prove
that
you
didnt
forget
your
pas
phrase
well
im
no
lawyer
but
ill
suppli
some
ancedot
evid
which
may
chang
your
mind
note
i
do
not
agre
at
all
with
what
went
on
in
thi
case
and
neither
will
most
of
you
that
doesnt
chang
the
fact
that
it
did
happen
right
here
in
america
even
about
three
or
four
year
ago
there
wa
a
rather
nasti
custodi
case
in
or
around
washington
dc
the
upshot
wa
an
exhusband
wa
su
for
visit
right
which
were
grant
the
woman
believ
that
the
man
had
been
sexual
molest
her
child
much
like
allenfarrow
but
not
a
famou
anyhow
she
spirit
away
the
kid
and
refus
to
tell
the
court
where
they
are
and
deni
him
visit
right
she
keep
her
mouth
shut
and
what
happen
she
sit
in
jail
for
almost
a
year
on
contempt
of
court
until
the
legislatur
pas
a
special
law
limit
the
time
a
person
can
be
held
if
they
hadnt
pas
the
law
shed
most
like
still
be
there
the
kid
were
in
new
zealand
i
beliv
now
stori
finish
commetari
start
imho
the
onli
reason
the
legislatur
move
wa
becaus
there
wa
an
outpour
of
public
sympathi
for
thi
woman
most
peopl
believ
she
wa
right
and
were
outrag
not
like
to
happen
for
joe
random
drug
dealer
child
molest
or
perfectli
innoc
privaci
lover
who
might
have
someth
to
hide
innoc
until
proven
guilti
doesnt
mean
you
get
to
walk
out
of
court
hum
a
happi
tune
becaus
the
fbi
cant
read
your
disk
just
ask
those
held
for
contempt
those
who
cant
make
bail
etc
etc
again
i
disagre
total
with
the
concept
of
hold
someon
base
on
suspicion
but
peopl
who
keep
think
that
it
wont
happen
are
bound
to
get
a
rude
shock
when
it
doe
also
not
a
lawyer
etc
but
if
i
rememb
correctli
the
contempt
of
court
busi
is
use
in
order
to
compel
cooper
with
what
is
perhap
question
differ
issu
the
legitim
busi
of
that
court
quit
liter
the
parti
is
found
guilti
of
hold
the
court
in
contempt
now
the
origin
scheme
a
suggest
here
would
be
to
have
the
key
disappear
if
certain
threaten
condit
are
met
onc
the
key
is
gone
there
is
no
question
of
contempt
of
court
a
there
is
noth
to
compel
the
key
is
no
longer
there
to
be
produc
obstruct
of
justic
would
be
a
differ
issu
but
if
the
suspect
in
question
would
have
some
legitm
reason
to
protect
hi
data
from
pri
eye
howev
extenu
i
think
that
thi
charg
would
be
a
hard
nut
to

perhap
it
is
time
for
