announc
and
qa
on
clipper
chip
encrypt
marc
vanheyningen
write
the
main
thing
i
just
dont
get
is
whether
thi
chip
implement
symmetr
or
asymmetr
cryptograph
techniqu
anybodi
know
i
dont
know
but
im
a
will
to
specul
a
anyon
sever
peopl
have
suggest
that
the
chip
use
publickey
cryptographi
anoth
possibl
is
to
use
diffiehellman
key
exchang
or
some
other
algorithm
which
ha
a
similar
effect
dh
allow
both
end
to
agre
on
a
session
key
which
they
use
with
symmetr
cryptographi
someth
like
de
for
the
encrypt
how
could
the
back
door
key
work
in
thi
system
i
can
see
a
few
possibl
one
is
that
the
dhlike
algorithm
ha
the
properti
that
the
session
key
can
be
deduc
by
an
eavesdropp
who
know
the
back
door
key
for
one
or
possibl
both
communic
perhap
the
random
number
use
in
the
dh
are
seed
by
the
back
door
key
or
some
such
anoth
possibl
a
wa
suggest
here
earlier
is
that
the
chip
simpli
broadcast
the
session
key
encrypt
with
the
chip
own
intern
secret
key
in
thi
system
the
back
door
key
are
secret
key
usabl
for
decrypt
thi
session
key
broadcast
actual
the
chip
secret
key
doesnt
need
to
be
a
public
key
in
thi
usag
but
can
be
ident
to
the
secret
backdoor
key
thi
propos
seem
most
straightforward
to
me
still
anoth
possibl
is
that
the
encrypt
algorithm
use
for
the
messag
itself
ha
a
dual
key
properti
that
posse
of
either
of
two
key
can
be
use
to
decrypt
it
one
key
would
be
the
session
key
from
the
dh
exchang
and
the
other
would
be
the
back
door
key
for
the
chip
it
worth
note
that
one
of
the
propos
dorothi
den
rais
dure
her
amazingli
prescient
onlin
discus
last
novemb
and
decemb
wa
a
variat
on
diffiehellman
in
which
a
third
parti
would
particip
in
deriv
the
session
key
thi
doesnt
quit
fit
into
what
we
know
of
how
clipper
work
but
it
hint
that
those
who
had
earli
knowledg
of
clipper
or
whose
think
wa
somehow
synchron
with
clipper
design
may
have
had
diffiehellman
on
their
