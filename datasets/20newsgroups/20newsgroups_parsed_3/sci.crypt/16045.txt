work
either
we
can
pick
up
laptop
screen
without
ani
problem
most
of
the
socal
low
radiat
monitor
are
also
useless
the
descript
turn
out
to
a

assert
rather
than
an

one
we
thought
there
might
be
a
market
for
a
monitor
which
wa
not
a
huge
expens
a
the
militari
tempest
kit
but
which
wa
well
enough

commerci

wa
exactli
zero
in
the
absenc
of
open
standard
a
monitor
which
realli
is
low
radiat
and
cost
dollar
more
cant
compet
against
a
monitor
which
just
claim
to
be
low
radiat
and
whose
onli
extra
cost
of
product
is
the

it
can
pick
up
emiss
from
almost
ani
chip
if
that
is
true
the
kind
monitor
would
not
make

differ
becuas
everyth

with

it
would
probabl
still
be
possibl
to
pick

at

it
