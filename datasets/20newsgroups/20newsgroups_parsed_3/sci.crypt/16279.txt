if
i
want
to
talk
to
someon
i
dont
need
to
have
previous
exchang
key
with
him
i
just
call
him
up
and
the
phone
establish
a
session
key
for
u
use
a
zeroknowledg
algorithm
or
someth
of
the
kind
if
ive
misunderstood
thi
part
it
probabl
invalid
the
rest
of
thi
notion
thi
lend
itself
to
spoof
i
go
buy
a
pair
of
clipper
phone
to
go
on
a
pair
of
phone
line
in
a
back
room
somewher
and
have
the
digit
switch
program
to
redirect
hi
call
to
one
of
my
two
line
instead
of
to
hi
whenev
he
receiv
a
call
the
two
phone
are
wire
backtoback
in

anyon
see
ani
problem
with
thi
scheme
other
than
to
assum
that
all
public

are

find
some

line
that
they
can
cut
into
the
degre
of
risk
depend
veri
much
on
locat
not
good
in
the
middl
of
a
busi
street
but
not
bad
on
a
line
in
open
countri
lead
to
a
drug
lord
ranch
the
onli
way
to
defeat
it
would
be
if
your
phone
had
the
equival
of
a
public
key
index
against
phone
number
for
everi
phone
you
might
want
to
call
all
of
them
total
impract
even
if
some
part
of
the
crippl
algorithm
could
be
use
a
a
kind
of
public
key
i
dont
understand
enough
about
these
thing
to
know
thi
sort
of
encrypt
scheme
is
onli
realli
workabl
over
a
radio
link
and
even
then
you
could
probabl
intereven
without
caus
problem
for
other
phone
nearbi
if
you
were
physic
close
to
the
target
phone
gosh
yet
anoth
way
to
get
round
crippl
encrypt
how
mani
is
that
weve
found
so
far
and
that
without
even
know
the
detail
of
the
algorithm
