david

write
some
of
the
messag
here
seem
to
reflect
the
view
that
the
govern
is
listen
in
on
everyth
and
one
will
have
to
hide
one
clipper
messag
somehow
if
nonescrow

a
littl
perspect
might
be
in
order
the
number
of
court

wire
tap
is
pretti
low

enforc
ha
to
present
pretti
good
evid
to
get
even
that
limit
number
of
author
thu
the
overwhelm
major
of
convers
are
neither
tap
nor
record
by
the
govern
and
for
that
to
happen
they
have
to
a
have
a
pretti
good
reason
with

pretti
good

though
the

may
be
imperfect
it
is
a
long
way
from
the

anticip
david
sternlight
great
care
ha
been
taken
to
ensur
the
accuraci
of
our
inform
error
and
omiss
except
again
we
have
the
trust
in
govern
problem
here
member
of
mr
sternlight
gener
trust
the
govern
to
a
degre
which
member
of
my
gener
find
ridicul
i
would
suggest
that
mr
sternlight
read
about
the
cointelpro
program
or
about
j
edgar
hoover
or
about
the
wiretap
of
martin
luther
king
then
after
he
ha
digest
thi
inform
he
can
ponder
the
fact
that
while
the
govern
doe
not
tap
everi
convers
that
they
have
a
record
of
tap
mani
convers
that
they
have
no
right
to
even
under
their
own
law
given
the
long
histori
of
member
of
the
u
govern
ignor
the
law
that
appli
to
them
it
is
no
wonder
that
so
mani
peopl
in
here
sound
so
paranoid
and
given
the
fact
that
it
is
often
difficult
or
imposs
to
punish
these
individu
onc
they
are
discov
it
is
no
wonder
that
so
mani
peopl
in
here
have
so
littl
faith
in
the
