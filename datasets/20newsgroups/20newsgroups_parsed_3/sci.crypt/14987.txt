write
lot
of
stuff
i
hate
to
follow
up
to
my
own
post
but
i
should
perhap
clarifi
some
thing
so
i
wont
get
flame
first
of
all
when
im
talk
about
factor
the
modulu
or
a
breakthrough
in
factor
what
i
realli
mean
is
a
breakthrough
in
the
cryptanalysi
of
rsa
i
know
that
factor
and
break
rsa
are
not
proven
to
be
equival
it
just
so
damn
conveni
not
to
repeat
thi
everi
time
i
also
have
to
admit
that
i
dont
realli
know
if
the
nongroup
properti
of
a
cipher
is
essenti
onli
for
key
chain
i
have
thought
about
it
a
littl
while
but
i
cant
find
a
way
that
a
cryptanalyst
could
exploit
a
group
structur
that
of
cours
mean
noth
at
all
then
i
wrote
pleas
note
that
a
long
a
it
is
much
harder
to
factor
a
rsa
modulu
than
it
is
to
gener
it
the
increas
in
comput
speed
alon
will
keep
key
length
and
modulu
factor
in
lockstep
ie
peopl
will
simpli
start
use
longer
modulu
and
still
be
safe
what
i
meant
wa
that
a
long
a
the
onli
advantag
of
the
cryptanalyst
is
a
faster
comput
then
we
will
probabl
have
rsa
for
a
long
time
to
come
becaus
even
if
bit
modulu
somehow
could
be
broken
with
fast
comput
not
with
a
new
algorithm
then
peopl
would
simpli
use
longer
modulu
both
user
and
cryptanalyst
benefit
from
better
technolog
in
the
same
way
hope
thi
keep
the
flame
away
have
fun
