that
for

could
by
crack
one

in

de
for
all
the
complaint
about
a
bit
key
would
probabl
cost
sever
million
dollar
to
build
a
keysearch
machin
for
i
can
buy
a
de
keysearch
machin
off
the
shelf
now
for
approx
k
but
it
is
not
sold
by
that
name
go
buy
a

cant

buy
a

oh
but
can
big
brother
afford
such
thing
in
these
time
of
tight
budget
i
dont
know
how
mani
folk
notic
it

dorothi
trust
me
den
gave
a
real
clue
to
the
current
state
of
the
art
at
nsa
on
decrypto
machin
when
she
said
the
nsa
told
her
they
didnt
even
want
to
be
the
holder
of
ani
part
of
the
key
now
whi
is
that
i
doubt
there
is
a
trapdoor
in
skipjack
but
we
will
never
know
and
i
doubt
the
nsa
would
promot
a
mass
market
chip
they
couldnt
compromis
ergo
nsa
is
now
capabl
of
compromis
probabl
with
brute
forc
keysearch
engin
of
the
complex
of
skipjack
look
at
the
spec
whi
i
bet
they
have
thousand
of
littl
chip
chug
away
in
their
crypto
buster
mayb
even
ten
of
thousand
complex
not
much
more
than
a
how
mani
such
machin
will
fit
into
