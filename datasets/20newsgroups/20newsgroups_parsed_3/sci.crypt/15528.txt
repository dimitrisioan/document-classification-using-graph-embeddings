that

draw
your

about
the

sorri
if

than
clear
i
wa
refer
to
our

effort
to
receiv
export
permiss
from
nsa
for
the
pkzip
encrypt
algorithm
not
to
ani
effort
on
the
part
of
phil
katz
or
pkware
i
should
point
out
that
the
origin
version
of
thi
algorithm
wa
design
by
roger
schlafli
and
that
we
mean
roger
and
myself
were
twice
deni
an
export
licens
for
it
the
second
go
round
wa
just
thi
past
fall
i
had
no
knowledg
of
phil
attempt
in
thi
i
do
not
even
know
for
sure
if
he
choos
to
implement
the
algorithm
a
it
wa
design
by
roger
though
i
believ
that
wa
at
least
the
case
for
version
prior
to
and
then
there
the
question
of
key
manag
and
even
if
our
applic
were
ident
there
is
no
reason
to
assum
the

would
treat
