i
dont
wish
to
rehash
the
pgp
patent
issu
at
all
but
i
do
feel
that
some
potenti

need

write
if
pgp
violat
rsa
patent
then
onli
execut
pgp
could
be
a
violat
distribut
pgp
could
be
contributori
infring
but
the
pgp
document
seem
suffici
to
me
to
protect
distributor
befor
i
delet
it
use
pgp
might
be
a
patent
violat
in
the
u
so
i
have
no
need
to
keep
it
you
are
correct
that
execut
pgp
would
be
a
violat
unless
the
patent
were
declar
invalid
by
the
court
but
there
is
a
question
a
to
when
how
or
if
distribut
pgp
would
be
a
violat
if
the
person
or
compani
distribut
pgp
receiv
money

so
then
it
is
clearli
a
sale
for
exampl
if
it
were
on
compuserv
they
charg
you
for
access
so
they
would
be
sell
pgp
when
there
is
no
charg
for

get

there
would
still
be

re

you
have
no
legal
action
you
can
take
unless
you
believ
you
can
prove
someon
is
use
pgp
in
the

for
a
purpos
other
than
that
specif
allow
by
patent
law
not
entir
correct
anyon
can
sue
for
ani
reason
but
you
can
not
prevail
unless
you
can
prove
that
by
a
prepoder
of
evid
under

law
pgp
doe
have
legitim
use
a
a

your

in

improv
which
would
still
requir
your
approv
to

until
the

run
out
around
thi
is
a
common
misconcept
the
patent
law
do
not
mention
ani
valid
purpos
for
infring
a

although
it
is
clear
that
in
order
to
creat
a
new
invent
either
base
on
a
prior
patent
or
to
avoid
infring
a
prior
patent
one
must
perform
research
on
an

to
just
say
that
you
