a

i
spoke
today
with
the
compani
mention
in
a
washington
time
articl
about
the
clipper
chip
announc
the
name
of
the
compani
is
secur
communicatiion
technolog
inform
will
be
given
at
the
end
of
thi
messag
on
how
to
contact
them
basic
they
are
disturb
about
the
announc
for
mani
reason
that
we
are
more
specif
howev
mr
bryen
of
secur
commun
brought
to
light
mani
point
that
might
interest
most
of
the
reader
hi
belief
is
that
att
wa
made
known
of
the
clipper
well
befor
the
rest
of
the
industri
thi
is
for
sever
reason
sever
of
which
are
a
compani
of
att
size
could
never
be
abl
to
make
a
decis
to
use
the
new
chip
on
the
same
day
it
wa
announc
month
ago
they
propos
use
their
own
chip
for
att
secur
telephon
devic
att
basic
blew
them
off
a
be
not
interest
at
all
thi
stuck
them
a
strang
until
now
also
i
spoke
with
art
melnick
their
cryptograph
he
express
sever
concern
over
the
new
clipper
chip
the
obviou
backdoor
will
be
abl
to
let
mani
peopl
decrypt
the
code
onc
the
key
is
releas
to
author
the
secur
of
the
crypto
system
is
lost
forev
these
key
can
end
up
in
the
hand
of
ani
agenc
of
the
govern
the
fact
that
the
escrow
key
never
chang
mean
that
the
algorithm
is
vulner
over
time
to
an
attack
the
classifi
algorithm
may
hide
anoth
backdoor
but
he
feel
that
it
is
probabl
to
keep
peopl
from
forg
fake
serial
number
or
chang
the
key
themselv
addit
he
feel
that
the
nsa
ha
probabl
spent
enough
time
and
money
in
work
on
a
way
to
keep
thi
chip
from
be
revers
engin
that
he
feel
that
revers
engin
it
will
be
veri
difficult
to
do
he
feel
that
they
have
develop
a
suitabl
techniqu
to
protect
the
chip
from
thi
attack
also
he
feel
that
the
chip
is
hardwar
encod
with
the
algorithm
and
not
microcod
onto
the
chip
additon
i
spoke
with
mr
melnick
about
their
algorithm
he
couldnt
tell
me
much
about
their
new
agorithm
becaus
it
hasnt
been
patent
yet
howev
he
told
me
a
littl
the
algorithm
will
be
releas
for
public
review
after
patent
have
been
grant
for
it
thi
is
so
the
crypto
commun
can
see
that
it
is
secur
the
algorithm
is
call
nea
for
new
encrypt
algorithm
the
detail
were
sketchi
becaus
now
it
is
held
a
a
trade
secret
until
the
patent
wa
issu
but
i
wa
told
that
it
will
incorpor
the
follow
it
will
have
fast
encrypt
of
data
exact
spec
not
given
but
mr
melnick
state
much
faster
than
what
an
r
can
put
out
it
is
a
symmetr
cipher
just
like
idea
and
de
it
will
use
bit
data
block
for
encrypt
like
de
and
idea
the
key
length
wa
not
given
to
me
but
mr
melnick
state
that
it
is
adujust
and
is
more
than
adequ
for
secur
the
algorithm
is
written
in
c
and
assembl
in
softwar
form
and
can
be
port
to
mani
platform
unlik
the
the
clipper
chip
which
is
hardwar
onli
and
can
not
be
made
into
softwar
thi
i
consid
a
definit
plu
for
the
nea
for
widespread
use
the
algorithm
will
accomod
public
key
distribut
techniqu
such
a
rsa
or
diffiehellman
thi
will
also
be
support
in
the
hardwar
chip
right
now
the
project
cost
of
the
nea
chip
will
be
about
dollar
for
each
clipper
will
run
each
chip
that
is
if
it
is
produc
enough
which
probabl
wont
happen
they
current
sell
a
program
call
ccom
that
us
the
algorithm
and
a
special
stream
protocol
that
doe
not
divid
the
encrypt
data
into
block
thi
could
prevent
plaintext
attack
if
you
know
what
the
block
header
is
thi
program
oper
at
all
support
r
speed
and
us
the
softwar
implement
of
the
algorithm
most
importantli
it
doe
not
have
a
backdoor
right
now
the
compani
is
afraid
that
the
new
clipper
chip
will
put
them
out
of
busi
thi
is
a
veri
real
possibl
so
they
realli
need
help
in
stop
the
clipper
chip
from
becom
a
standard
if
you
want
to

them
they
