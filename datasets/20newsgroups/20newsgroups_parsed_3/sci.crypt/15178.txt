the

mani
seem
to

who
are
they
to

anoth

there
is
no

that
in

rather
conserv

that

ridicul
loss

employ

given
the
heterogen

from

the

not
some
say
that
anonym

are
coward
and
should
stand
up

be
count
perhap
that
is
one
point
of
view
but
what
right
do
these
detractor
have
to
exercis
such

from

whi
is
it
censorship
to
not
expect
someon
to

without

thi
is
at

a

argument
you
tell

what
you
have

you
tell

whi
the

principl
of

privaci
i
have
been
subject
to
far
more
abus
and
attack
than
i
ever
receiv
befor
peopl
seem
to
find
it
easier
to
flame
and
insult
someon
whose

they
dont

perhap
it
easier
to
pretend
that
there
is
no

feel
the
sting
of

comment
anonym
doe
hinder
some

peopl
who
seek
such

will
natur
oppos
it
from
instead
of
make
thi
a
freeer
medium
by
allow

to
protect
themselv
with
anonym

requir
that
all

be
prepar

take
the

thi
seem
to
be
the

third
is
about

actual
thi
wa
start
by
peopl

then
it
wa
point
out
that

richard

they

toward
the
net
a
a
whole
such
a
servic
should
imho
have
a
set
of
welldefin
rule
and
a
contract
that
it
client
should
sign
under
the
term
of
which
they
are
assur
anonym
from
is
the
problem
that
some
are
use
to
punish
poster
who
are
upset
in
some
vagu
way
by
complain
to
the
usual
acquiesc
sysadmin
or
organ
that
the
poster
belong
to
that
sure
is
the
most
gutless
approach
to
solv
problem
but
my
experi
on
the
net
show
that
the
same
user
who
vilifi
anonym
post
are
the
first
to
write
ob
detail
grievanc
to
the
poster
supervisor
when
hi
or
her
tranquil
is
disturb
by
some
intrus
or
subvers
post
or
anoth
anonym
post
prevent
just
thi
kind
of
intimid
from
eric
schill
the
main
point
i
would
like
to
make
here
is
that
while
we
can
go
through
and
revis
the
news
sw
to
reject
anon
post
to
technic
newsgroup
or
some
such
thing
i
think
the
attempt
will
prove
futil
each
attempt
to
modifi
news
can
result
in
a
chang
approach
by
anon
servic
provid
to
thwart
the
chang
i
think
thi
would
be
pointless
from
johan
helsingiu
i
have
tri
to
stay
out
of
thi
discus
and
see
where
the
discus
lead
but
now
i
ralli
feel
like
i
have
to
speak
up
i
have
repeatedli
made
clear
that
i
do
block
user
if
they
continu
their
abus
after
have
been
warn
in
mani
case
the
user
have
taken
heed
of
the
warn
and
stop
and
in
some
case
even
apolog
in
public
and
when
the
warn
ha
not
had
the
desir
effect
i
have
block
a
number
of
user
i
have
also
block
access
to
group
where
the
readership
ha
taken
a
vote
to
ban
anonym
post
although
i
feel
chang
the
newsgroup
statu
to
moder
is
the
onli
perman
solut
for
newsgroup
that
want
to
formal
discus
richard
e
depew
doe
thi
mean
that
you
are
volunt
to
issu
a
request
for
discus
to
ban
anonym
post
or
to
moder
each
of
the
newsgroup
that
your
server
can
reach
i
dont
think
so
but
thi
illustr
the
troubl
that
your
server
is
caus
plea
listen
to
the
consensu
of
the
news
administr
in
thi
group
ani
newsgroup
should
be
consult
befor
let
your
server
post
messag
to
that
group
from
alexand
eichen
there
is
no
pompou
consensu
of
the
news
administr
here
mayb
you
would
like
to
invent
one
there
is
a
sizeabl
number
of
peopl
who
are
concern
about
the
possibl
and
to
a
minor
extent
about
the
actual
abus
of
the
server
a
it
is
configur
now
these
concern
are
respect
johan
is
deal
with
them
there
are
some
few
who
rage
with
foam
befor
their
mouth
and
condemn
the
servic
altogeth
and
a
number
who
defend
it
point
out
like
kate
gregori
that
even
a
group
like
misckid
can
benefit
from
pseudonym
post
from
johan
helsingiu
i
have
answer
a
lot
of
person
mail
relat
to

abus
and
a
a
result
of
that
block
a
number
of

i
have
also
withdrawn

i
feel
it
is
not
for

to

for
the

the
problem
with

is
that
the

is
rather
elect
repres

whith
a
strong

from
richard

thi
seem

be

attitud
i
would
consid

it

the
onli
peopl
who

are
those
that

the

polici
chang
should
be
made
by

not
by

you
need
to
persuad

a

the

would
like
to
keep

the
way
it
alway

been

thi

these
pseudonym

cut
into

so
they
whine

bitch
about

everi

there
the

such
a
somebodi
sig
be
too
long
they
tri
to
parlay
that
into
an

against

ill
go
on

a
say
three
cheer
for
the

at

like
penet
pax

nkbt
and
for

the

a

tri

i
wouldnt
help
peopl
get
rid

a

if
you

say
then
you
put

in

not
all
of
them
of
cours
if
and
when
i
get
an

go
im
just
go
to
assign
fake

like
jsmith
instead
of

avoid
most
of
the
hassl
youll
never
know
it
is
anonym
will
you
from
ann
bennett
i
must
admit
to
some
astonish
at
thi
argument
i
see
the
valu
of
anonym
post
under
some
circumst
yet
believ
strongli
that
these
should
be
identifi
a
such
so
that
peopl
who
do
not
wish

themselv
dont
have
to

fail
to

inde
surmis
that

hide
the

would
you
care

just
the

have
no

i
consid
the

it

that
conspir

somehow
peopl
on

not
even
argu

rather
just
to

is
it
that
everybodi
el
ha
to
put
up
with

of
the
misus
of
anonpenetfi
whose
definit
of
polit

appli
and
whi
whi
is
univers
anon
access
consid
to
be
within
the
realm
of
thi
fuzzi
concept
of
polit
in
the
first
place
i
think
johan
ha
long
sinc
cross
the
line
into
be
a
rude
bastard
and
i
told
him
so
in
privat
mail
a
littl
while
ago
at
thi
point
i
deepli
regret
a
have
creat
an
anonym
system
support
newsgroup
and
b
have
given
the
code
to
johan
i
didnt
copyright
it
but
i
thought
that
some
concept
of
polit
and
good
sen
might
follow
it
to
new
home
interest
that
johan
idea
of
polit
and
good
sen
seem
to
have
nearli
no
interesect
with
mine
i
could
even
cope
with
univers
anon
access
if
johan
would
be
will
to
engag
in
abus
control
but
somehow
that
seem
to
be
outsid
the
rang
of
realiti
from
johan
helsingiu
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
convey
how
sad
and
upset
your
messag
made
me
i
do
to
some
extent
understand
your
feel
but
it
still
feel
realli
bad
run
the
server
requir
get
use
to
a
lot
of
flame
but
mindlessli
abus
hate
mail
is
so
much
easier
to
deal
with
than
someth
like
thi
a
i
do
respect
and
valu
your
view
and
opinion
to
a
high
degre
no
im
not
ask
for
sympathi
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
i
am
realli
give
your
view
quit
a
lot
of
weight
when
i
ask
for
the
softwar
i
wa
actual
onli
go
to
provid
the
servic
to
scandinavian
user
but
a
lot
of
peopl
request
that
i
keep
the
servic
open
to
the
intern
commun
i
now
realiz
that
i
ought
to
have
contact
you
at
that
point
to
ask
how
you
feel
about
me
use
your
stuff
in
such
a
context
again
i
realli
want
to
apologis
and
i
will
replac
the
remain
few
piec
of
code
thet
still
stem
from
your
system
unfortun
there
is
no
way
to
remov
the
idea
and
structur
i
got
from
you
again
i
am
realli
sorri
that
the
result
of
your
work
end
up
be
use
in
a
way
that
you
dont
approv
of
and
i
will
be
give
a
lot
of
hard
thought
to
the
possibl
of
shut
down
the
server
alltogeth
from
i
think
im
feel
especi
rude
and
impolit
if
it
good
for
johan
it
good
for
me
after
all
he
didnt
ask
the
greater
usenet
whether
univers
anon
access
wa
a
good
idea
he
just
did
it
ye
im
a
serious
rude
pain
in
the
as
now
and
i
think
ill
arm
the
usenet
death
penalti
slightli
modifi
not
for

wholesit
attack
but
tactic
assault
just
destruct
onli
outsid
alt
too
let
say
to
parrot
thi
linepeopl
have
been
do
thing
like
the

that
is
cancel

for

no
one
could
ever
stop
them
and
it
onli
polit
and
good
sen
that
ha
prevent
them
up
to
now
in
fact
i
have
peopl
who
have
express
privat
the
desir
and
abil
to
arm
the

p
no
in
fact
there
are
not
newsadmin
readi
to

it
would
be
amus
to
know
how
mani
peopl
gulp
hard
when

read

though
i
dont
see
it
a
ani
differ

pp
now
that
ive
calm
some
fear
by
the

p
there
are
newsadmin
readi
to
arm
the
udp
theyv
ask
for
my

i
havent

onli
one

would
be

anyon
can
implement
the

on

if
they
care
to

prevent

so
i
wonder
how
long
befor
one
form
of

bring
on
anoth
form
from

helsingiu
it
would
be
trivial
easi
to

in

let

a
veri
simpl
one
if
