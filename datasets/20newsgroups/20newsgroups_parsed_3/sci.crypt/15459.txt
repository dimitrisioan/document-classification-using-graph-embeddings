write
brad
templeton
write
their
strategi
is
a
busi
one
rather
than
legal
one
they
are
push
to
get
a
standard
in
place
a
secret
standard
and
if
they
get
it
a
a
standard
then
they
will
drive
competitor
out
of
the
market
it
will
be
legal
to
sell
better
untap
encrypt
that
doesnt
have
regist
key
but
it
will
be
difficult
and
thu
not
a
plan
for
most
phone
compani
if
brad
analysi
is
correct
it
may
offer
an
explan
for
whi
the
encrypt
algorithm
is
be
kept
secret
thi
will
prevent
competitor
from
come
out
with
clippercompat
phone
which
lack
the
govern
instal
back
door
the
strategi
brad
describ
will
onli
work
a
long
a
the
onli
way
to
get
compat
phone
is
to
have
one
with
the
govern
chip
it
would
be
nice
from
the
point
of
view
of
person
privaci
if
brad
turn
out
to
be
right
a
long
a
peopl
still
have
the
power
to
provid
their
own
encrypt
in
place
of
or
in
addit
to
the
clipper
privaci
is
still
possibl
but
the
word
of
sever
passag
in
the
announc
make
me
doubt
whether
thi
will
turn
out
to
be
true
even
if
what
brad
say
turn
out
to
be
accur
you
can
bet
that
the
administr
will
have
made
it
veri
clear
to
the
vendor
that
it
would
veri
much
be
in
their
best
interest
to
institut
a
voluntari
polici
of
refus
to
sell
anyth

clinton

anyon
other
than

govern
agenc
and
law
enforc
or
individu
and
corpor
who
have
been
been
determin
by
the
administr
to
have
a
valid
need
on
a
casebycas
basi
for
an
effect
system
note
that
thi
is
veri
much
like
the
languag
use
in
mani
gun
control
billslaw
the
administr
is
push
for
or
otherwis
support
the
logic
and
actual
rational
a
oppos
to
the
excus
that
get
fed
to
the
medium
is
the
same
in
both
case
onli
the
item
or
technolog
in
question
are
differ
i
think
thi
is
no
accid
it
come
from
the
same
philosophi
that
the
govern
rulescontrol
the
peopl
not
the
peopl
control
the
govern
that
the
unconnect
citizen
are
not
sophist
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
them
so
the
govern
must
tell
the
peopl
what
they
need
or
do
not
need
we
know
best
and
the
idea
that
that
a
common
can
defend
himself
against
govern
eavesdrop
or
unlaw
attack
is
total
unaccept
to
peopl
with
thi
outlook

combin
thi
all
with

system
and
with
you
can
be
certain
more
jewel
yet
to
come
and
one
see
an
extrem
omin
trend
so
what
if
will
be
ten
year
late
it
still
is
turn
out
to
be
an
amazingli
accur
propheci
unless
a
lot
of
peopl
wake
up
and
in
a
hurri
one
should
alway
have

come
up
when
the

seek
to
set
itself
apart
in

or
should
we
now

instead
whi
shouldnt
the

have
a

it
would
take

use
the

one
should
