write
you
could
just
a
well
use
a
charact
password
to
perform
the
encrypt
of
the
zero
bit
one
simpl
method
would
be
to
use
the
first
charact
to
encrypt
the
zero
bit
and
then
use
the
remain
charact
to
encrypt
the
result
again
the
output
would
still
be
bit
which
encod
into
ascii
charact
wouldnt
thi
method
be
vulner
against
a
birthday
attack
current
a
cracker
need
to
find
the
onli
key
that
produc
the
given
ciphertext
he
ha
to
tri
about
key
on
the
averag
in
the
propos
method
the
cracker
onli
need
ani
pair
of
key
halv
if
he
can
store
about
guess
for
one
half
he
is
like
to
find
a
mathch
pair
in
about
guess
here
i
have
assum
that
the
desencrypt
is
revers
if
the
key
is
guess
is
thi
so
or
do
the
modif
of
the
sbox
by
the
salt
bit
make
it
nonrevers
probabl
there
is
onli
one
key
i
think
there
is
chanc
in
about
that
there
are
two
or
more
key
can
anyon
verifi
thi
but
thi
doesnt
help
the
cracker
much
