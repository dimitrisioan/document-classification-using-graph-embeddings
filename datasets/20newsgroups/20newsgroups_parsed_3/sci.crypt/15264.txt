enough
in
design
the
escrow
we
may
want
to
use
some
rather
unusu
technolog
such
a
seal
box
of
paper
or
destruct
read
memori
rather
than
typic
comput
databas
which
is
fun
for
a
databas
of
hundr
of
million
of
key
the
greatest
danger
of
the
escrow
databas
if
it
were
kept
on
disk
would
be
the
chanc
that
a
complet
copi
could
somehow
leak
out
you
can
design
lot
of
protect
but
with
enough
corrupt
a
complet

is
alway
possibl
store
it

may

a

if

it
hard

howev
i

the

the

is
not

when

the

an
