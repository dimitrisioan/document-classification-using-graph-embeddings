get

to

the

also
make
decipher
all
past
convers
which
may
be
on
tape
or
disk
or
whatver
a
i
understand
the
propos
i
could
be
wrong
but
ive
seen
no
mention
of
session
key
be
the
escrow
entiti
true
in
theori
in
practic
the
technolog
of
cellular
phone
will
probabl
be
spread
spectrum
and
quit
difficult
to
record
the
crypttext
without
the
key
if
the
frequenc
path
depend
on
they
key
a
i
understand
it
to
it
could
be
made
effect
imposs
to
record
i
am
not
an
expert
in
the
cryptographi
scienc
but
some
basic
thing
seem
evid
to
me
thing
which
thi
clinton
clipper
do
not
address
the
all
pertain
to
opportunit
for
abus
and
conclus
base
on
what
i
have
seen
the
membership
of
thi
group
except
for
two
notabl
person
agre
to
if
anyth
bad
is
possibl
by
the
govern
in
theori
it
almost
alway
end
up
happen
in
fact
so
the
key
is
to
make
abus
imposs
question
author
and
rememb
power
doe
corrupt
i
think
one
ha
to
regard
thi
whole
idea
in
the
sens
that
it
will
be
expand
to
includ
other
data
form
such
a
data
transfer
and
store
data
and
a
such
should
be
treat
a
if
it
were
expand
or
such
expans
will
be
almost
imposs
to
stop
use
clipper
a
a
precid
there
wa
a
hint
of
that
in
the
propos
rememb
that
said
pleas
bear
with
me
i
am
not
veri
articul
so
i
take
more
word
to
say
what
other
could
say
much
more
briefli
thank
you
onc
it
hit
land
you
can
record
it
if
you
have
telco
access
the
telco
isnt
suppos
to
give
that
without
a
warrant
that
the
rule
today
a
i
suggest
thi
is
now
the
hint
is
in
the
propos
that
thi
or
similar
propos
are
be
consid
for
other
form
of
encrypt
such
a
data
transfer
data
file
and
such
larg
depend
on
how
thi
thing
is
accept
or
fli
i
think
one
would
be
wise
to
treat
thi
in
the
manner
one
would
when
not
if
it
get
expand
to
other
area
than
cellular
phone
i
think
thi
is
guarante
to
happen
if
thi
propos
get
by
salami
polit
it
ha
been
and
is
use
in
sever
other
area
it
is
certain
to
be
use
here
govern
is
not
go
to
easili
give
up
on
the
idea
that
they
should
be
abl
to
eavesedrop
whenev
they
want
to
court
order
requir
ha
proven
to
be
a
rather
flimsi
guarante
if
the
case
warrant
they
can
alway
siez
the
materi
and
forc
one
to
give
the
key
or
sit
in
jail
forev
on
period
renew
contempt
charg
so
it
is
not
deni
the
justic
system
the
inform
nor
the
abil
to
lock
someon
up
if
guilti
or
refus
to
divulg
the
mean
to
access
the
info
thi
is
not
protect
under
the
fifth
one
can
be
forc
to
perform
act
that
would
result
in
divulg
incrimin
evid
so
block
restrict
on
privat
encrypt
is
not
prevent
legitim
law
enforc
it
doe
make
illegitim
law
enforc
a
bunch
more
difficult
especi
fish
expedit
without
the
target
knowleg
dont
give
up
the
right
to
be
safe
from
that
that
should
be
nonnegoti
and
clinton
and
co
know
it
which
is
probabl
whi
they
quietli
develop
thi
thing
figur
if
they
get
it
thi
far
they
can
ram
it
on
through
how
come
those
consult
could
be
roughli
describ
a
u
insid
they
can
not
quiet
impliment
it
though
when
they
ban
other
scheme
to
ensur
it
exclus
use
henc
the
nice

document
to
tri

reassur
everyon
dont

ha
govern
realli
earn
that
kind
of
trust
past

futur
to
be
secur
and
free
one
must
keep
govern
honest
and
the
onli
way
to
do
that
is
to
make
abus
imposs
not
unlik
or
difficult
but
even
so
the
evid
would
not
be
admiss
i
think
unless
the
judg
so
order
i
think
that
even
intercept
of
the
crypttext
without
a

would
be
illeg
cop
cant
record
today
plain
cellular
call
and
then
ask
a
judg
hey
can
we
have
permiss
to
listen
to
those
tape
can
they
so
what
one
could
use
inform
gain
by
reus
of
the

save
after
the
last

wa
finish
or
other
mean
master

backdoor
easili
broken
algorithm
to
find
other

which
given
to
a

would
author
a

which
wouldnt
have
been
possibl
otherwis
thi
ha
been
the
more
common
manner
of
abus
of
wiretap
in
the
past
for
local
cop
thi
might
be
workabl
to
keep
them
honest
but
the
fed
have
a
workaround
somehow
bet
on
it
doe
anyon
realli
believ
for
exampl
that
the
govern
will
use
a
scheme
nsa
can
not
listen
in
on
scan
for
keyword
either
easili
defeat
in
realtim
or
via
a
master
key
i
sure
dont
thi
whole
thing
sound
like
someth
to
elimin
the
need
to
use
oldfashion
polic
work
to
build
a
case
in
the
past
eavesdrop
wa
rather
easi
with
or
without
a
court
order
i
think
the
law
enforc
commun
ha
becom
a
bit
spoil
and
will
resist
chang
that
requir
them
to
revert
to
use
oldfashion
detect
work
i
just
find
it
somewhat
surpris
come
from
a
bunch
that
care
so
much
about
civil
and
individu
right
that
put
peopl
first
the
question
is
put
peopl
first
to
where
with
the
innard
not
be
reveal
how
is
one
to
be
sure
there
doesnt
exist
a
master
key
for
use
by
nsa
etc
so
they
can
do
their
keyword
scan
etc
on
convers
they
routin
monitor
without
a
specif
court
order
rememb
the
cellular
phone
limiti
is
onli
temporari
bet
on
it
and
so
far
i
have
not
heard
about
polic
tell
peopl
that
they
have
been
tap
and
noth
incrimin
wa
found
what
is
to
keep
them
from
simpli
keep
the
key
on
file
for
next
time
after
awhil
they
would
have
quit
a
collect
kept
especi
for
folk
they
deem
disrupt
and
if
they
get
onli
one
key
that
would
reduc
the
search
space
a
lot
unless
it
is
an
rsa
scheme
rememb
nixon
year
need
for
court
order
realli
slow
them
down
didnt
it
and
unless
the
escrow
account
are
not
govern
control
fat
chanc
i
see
one
end
up
be
under
say
treasuri
the
other
under
justic
it
could
be
worth
some
seriou
buck
to
some
folk
to
get
key
to
a
competitor
clinton
clipper
or
descend
when
thi
idea
is
expand
to
be
use
for
all
nongovern
encrypt
enough
buck
would
get
one
the
key
or
the
innard
for
thi
algorithm
perhap
not
an
import
concern
but
given
past
govern
behavior
and
the
other
problem
wors
of
cours
if
the
govern
then
us
thi
clinton
clipper
to
argu
for
restrict
on
unapprov
encrypt
thi
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
u
i
think
the
camel
nose
in
the
tent
etc
ye
that
is
a
major
concern
but
i
think
that
they
think
they
can
win
just
by
have
of
the
usa
use
thi
system
they
dont
even
have
to
care
about
the
cautiou
that
left
they
dont
catch
the
realli
smart
crook
anyway

true
what
will
one
do
when
it

you
can
bet
that
if

it
is
even

then
use

grant
an

pleas
the

thi

can
succeed
without

forbid

they

that
they
are

howev
the

sinc
they

on

and
that
requir
a
bit
of

peopl
would
fight

forbid
more
now
but
in

two

becaus
we
have
thi

situat

must
be

just
thi
ad
reason
restrict
will
onli
bother
those
who
have
somet
to

pleas
dont
buy
into
it
if
the
clinton
clipper
is
so
veri
good
whi
not
make

algrithm
public
so
mani
peopl
can
exchang

examin

rather
than
a

expert
respect
by

for
what
perhap
a

who

would
be

thi
doe

what
the

examin
is
the
same
a
what
will
end
up
be
use
in
the
clipper
chip
if
it
is
kept
secret
perhap
the
clipper
will
use
a
crippl

with
a

subject
for

the

no

i

are
reject
if

the

anoth
question
sinc
it
is
a
safe
bet
thi
clipper
thing
would
not
be
use
for
govern
secur
they
are
regard
it
a
not
real
secur
but
good
enough
for
common
folk
i
think
i
would
like
to
see
a
full
descript
not
a
pr
nonstat
of
just
what
good
enough
mean
i
think
when
say
how
strong
it
is
good
enough
realli
mean
not
veri
the
excus
that
other
countri
have
these
restrict
is
not
accept
other
countri
do
not
have
our
bill
of
right
and
constitut
which
the
peopl
not
the
govern
of
those
other
countri
often
regard
with
envi
what
we
have
a
right
they
have
a
revok
privileg
and
if
we
expect
to
retain
those
right
and
protect
we
must
not
allow
them
to
be
gut
becaus
we
just
got
ta
have
thi
thing
to
fight
crime
we
have
allreadi
have
our
bill
of
right
pretti
much
torn
to

we
should
not
permit
more

anoth
nobl

instead
we
should
be
tri

the

our

may
have
a

too
mani
right

is
not
a

a

are
a

a
