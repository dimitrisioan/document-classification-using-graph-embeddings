anoth
key
registr
bodi
bite
the
dust
imho
one
of
the
candid
that
ha
been
suggest
for
a
key
registr
bodi
is
the
aclu
i
think
thi
is
poor
choic
the
aclu
is
essenti
a
group
of
auditor
they
audit
how
peopl
civil
liberti
are
administ
tradit
auditor
do
not
like
to
get
involv
in
the
design
or
oper
aspect
of
thing
and
with
good
reason
when
i
wa
a
system
programm
it
alway
infuri
me
that
the
auditor
would
come
in
and
tell
u
our
implement
stunk
from
a
secur
point
of
view
but
wouldnt
tell
u
how
to
fix
it
i
alway
figur
they
just
like
to
critciz
without
do
the
work
to
help
fix
the
problem
then
i
took
a
stint
a
an
auditor
and
i
found
out
the
real
reason
auditor
dont
like
to
recommend
solut
becaus
it
put
them
in
a
bad
posit
if
they
have
to
critic
the
implement
later
the
audite
can
say
well
you
told
u
thi
way
would
be
ok
it
compromis
the
independ
that
is
a
necessari
part
of
the
auditor
job
take
the
case
at
hand
suppos
aclu
becom
a
key
half
registrar
suppos
that
perhap
through
some
error
on
aclu
part
a
key
half
get
away
that
shouldnt
and
is
use
to
depriv
someon
of
her
civil
liberti
the
aclu
get
wind
of
thi
and
want
to
take
it
to
court
but
they
end
up
be
at
the
same
time
on
the
side
of
the
defend
and
of
the
plaintiff
which
is
not
an
easi
posit
to
be
in
there
are
except
to
the
complet
independ
of
auditor
at
one
place
where
i
work
when
payrol
check
were
print
they
were
sign
automat
by
a
signatur
drum
on
the
burst
machin
thi
drum
wa
kept
by
the
auditor
who
also
kept
the
check
stock
and
wa
brought
down
to
data
process
when
it
wa
time
to
do
the
check
i
believ
the
differ
between
thi
situat
and
the
key
registr
situat
is
that
it
is
fairli
obviou
when
it
is
time
to
do
the
payrol
check
if
they
were
done
yesterday
and
someon
want
to
do
them
again
today
he
better
be
abl
to
produc
yesterday
check
so
that
they
can
be
destroy
determin
which
of
the
mani
request
for
key
halv
are
legit
is
a
trickier
process
one
much
more
prone
to
mistak
that
could
put
the
aclu
in
a
protectingthecli
versu
protectingtheaclu
conflict
of
interest
a
alway
my
opinion
are
my
own
lynn
