interestingli
enough
in
design
the
escrow
we
may
want
to
use
some
rather
unusu
technolog
such
a
seal
box
of
paper
or
destruct
read
memori
rather
than
typic
comput
databas
which
is
fun
for
a
databas
of
hundr
of
million
of
key
to
me
a
larger
problem
is
that
onc
disclos
your
key
could
be
use
to
decrypt
ani
previous
record
convers
i
gather
that
from
thi
propos
a
warrant
would
be
requir
to
get
the
key
but
not
to
collect
convers
consid
the
scenario
where
an
agenc
collect
preemptiv
all
encrypt
convers
for
certain
peopl
like
to
be
target
and
not
necessarili
legitim
target
then
arrang
for
some
unrel
incid
that
can
trigger
a
warrant
your
honor
we
know
that
the
suspect
ha
receiv
call
from
note
crime
figur
bugsi
butthead
said
call
arrang
by
the
agenc
and
we
must
therefor
have
thi
warrant
to
determin
whether
thi
suspect
in
a
sensit
govt
post
is
corrupt
i
suppos
that
it
is
conceiv
that
there
are
session
key
involv
somewher
but
that
doesnt
seem
like
if
there
are
whi
wouldnt
the
technic
overview
mention
them
when
it
go
to
such
detail
a
the
number
of
bit
held
by
each

author
thi
scheme
is
full
of
hole
