then
it
should
not
be
surpris
that
the
current
plot
ha
been
allow
to
happen
the
willing
of
the
major
of
the
peopl
to
give
up
their
freedom
in
exchang
for
a

is

entropi
is
alway
a

battl
most
peopl
would
rather
have
comfort
than
freedom
the
paradox
is
that
you
cant
realli
have
the
former
in
the
long
term
unless
you
have
the
latter
one
of
the
reason
that
i
probabl
come
across
to
some
peopl
a
a
weird
cross
between
a
libertarian
and
an
establish
tool
is
that
i
end
up
take
an
utterli
pragmat
view
of
govern
i
dont
get
up
in
arm
when
the
govern
fail
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
peopl
becaus
in
my
lifetim
it
never
hastherefor
i
have
no
expect
that
it
will
a
a
result
i
protect
my
own
interest
rather
than
expect
the
govern
to
be
fair
i
will
use
strong
cryptographi
when
i
think
it
is
need
whether
or
not
it
is
legal
at
the
time
same
thing
with
anyth
els
the
govern
would
rather
not
see
in
privat
handsthat
their
problem
what
import
to
me
is
use
the
right
tool
for
the
job
if
it
legal
so
much
the
better
if
it
is
not

doe

i
will
use
