remot

system
secur
in
light
of
my
recent
paranoia
concern
govern
propos
id
love
to
see
a
unixbas
encrypt
scheme
that
kept
some
file
encrypt
on
the
host
machin
say
all
the
file
in
your
home
directori
use
a
key
system
that
could
not
be
compromis
by
eavesdrop
over
a
modem
line
it
seem
that
thi
would
requir
modif
to
a
shell
program
and
a
way
of
tell
whether
a
file
wa
encrypt
or
not
among
other
thing
id
love
to
know
about
potenti
secur
hole
in
such
a
system
doe
such
a
system
exist
if
it
were
made
easytous
and
readili
avail
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thingtm
i
realiz
that
thi
would
probabl
just
involv
put
a
nice
frontend
on
a
readili
avail
and
veri
secur
encrypt
scheme
but
it
should
be
done
thank
for
the
ear
