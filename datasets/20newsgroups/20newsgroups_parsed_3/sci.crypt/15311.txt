in

eli
brandt
write
i
probabl
shouldnt
say
thi
but
they
could
tri
to
detect
the
use
of
an
illeg
cypher
by
transmit
in
the
clear
some
statist
properti
of
the
plaintext
an
oldfashion
wiretap
could
then
detect
the
use
of
preencrypt
which
would
drastic
increas
the
measur
entropi
of
the
input
a
countermeasur
to
thi
would
be
to
use
steganograph
techniqu
which
put
out
voic
thi
way
to
detect
preencrypt
may
be
defeat
one
can
do
transform
of
the
spectrum
of
encrypt
signal
just
by
ad
some
prearrang
in
the
begin
of
commun
function
i
think
so
say
you
can
do
fft
of
your
encrypt

just
think
for
