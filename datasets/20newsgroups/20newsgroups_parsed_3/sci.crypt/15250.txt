it
occur
to
me
that
if
they
get
a
wiretap
order
on
you
and
the
escrow
hous
releas
your
code
to
the
cop
your
code
is
now
no
longer
secur
it
in
the
hand
of
cop
and
while
i
am
sure
most
of
the
time
they
are
good
their
secur
will
not
be
a
good
a
the
escrow
hous
what
thi
effect
mean
is
that
if
they
perform
a
wiretap
on
you
at
the
end
of
the
wiretap
they
should
be
oblig
to
inform
you
that
a
tap
wa
perform
and
replac
for
free
the
clipper
chip
in
your
cellular
phone
so
that
it
is
onc
again
a
code
known
onli
to
the
escrow
hous
get
the
court
order
to
reveal
the
key
also
make
decipher
all
past
convers
which
may
be
on
tape
or
disk
or
whatver
a
i
understand
the
propos
i
could
be
wrong
but
ive
seen
no
mention
of
session
key
be
the
escrow
entiti
a
the
eff
note
thi
rais
further
issu
about
the
fruit
of
one
bust
lead
to
incrimin
in
other
area
but
is
it
ani
wors
than
the
current
unsecur
system
it
becom
much
wors
of
cours
if
the
govern
then
use
thi
clinton
clipper
to
argu
for
restrict
on
unapprov
encrypt
thi
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
u
i
think
the
camel
nose
in
the
tent
etc
and
it
may
also
becom
much
wors
if
the
