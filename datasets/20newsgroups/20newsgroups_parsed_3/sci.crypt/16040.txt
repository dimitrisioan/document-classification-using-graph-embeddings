re
write
to
clinton
white
hous
is
thi
white
hous
email
address
realli
work
yet
someon
post
such
an
address
on
compuserv
a
few
month
ago
but
appar
the
white
hous
wasnt
realli
set
up
to
reciv
hundr
thousand
thi
is
a
real
address
my
understand
of
the
current
process
that
mail
take
is
it
get
download
on
floppi
disk
and
is
process
by
retire
volunt
who
match
the
messag
against
messag
profil
and
check
the
messag
count
ie
yeah
that
a
for
gay
in
the
militari
what
thi
clipper
stuff
must
be
against
gay
in
the
militari
the
highervolum
whitehous
email
stuff
is
in
the
work
i
know
for
a
fact
but
wont
be
onlin
for
probabl
anoth
month
or
two
at
the
soonest
my
understand
is
that
the
link
speed
will
increas
direct
internet
instead
of
compuerv
to
floppi
but
the
messag
process
will
remain
the
same
unless
the
peopl
at
the
white
hous
print
and
distribut
thi
mail
everi
day
you
may
have
better
luck
print
out
a
letter
on
paper
that
flat
white
stuff
all
over
my
desk
and
snailmail
it
to
the
white
hous
i
imagin
write
to
your
local
repres
and
senat
wouldnt
hurt
either
heck
whi
not
write
to
al
gore
while
your
at
it
the
white
hous
email
doe
get
read
i
agre
that
print
it
and
send
cc
to
everyon
you
can
think
of
is
probabl
better
becaus
it
is
more
visibl
but
the
messag
process
fit
messag
against
a
templat
is
the
same
in
either
case
mjr
