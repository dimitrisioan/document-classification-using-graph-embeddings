the

will
onli
increas
their
number
even
if
there
is
some
benefit
to

through
the
use

it
must
be

in

tortur
is
use
a

peopl
i
suspect
it
is
an
effect
mean
of
obtain
inform

shorten

investig
it
probabl
also
help
keep
the
convict

high
the
fact
that
the

tool
is
not
use
in
thi
countri
even
with
a

obtain
by

probabl
caus
is
becaus
we
have
rightli
balanc
the
question
of
expedi

what
is
ethic

moral
right
i
think
that
the

question
of
expedi
versu
moral
should
come
into
play
when
consid
the
use

i
vote
for
moral
i
am
quit
disturb
by
what
i
interpret
a
a
veil
threat
to
prohibit
the
use
of
all

if
thi
big

is
not
put
