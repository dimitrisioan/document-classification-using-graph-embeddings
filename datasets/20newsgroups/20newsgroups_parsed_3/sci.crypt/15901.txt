the
propos
could
be
modifi
so
that
if
they
get
a
court
order
to
tap
you
and
dont
charg
you
with
a
crime
within
say
day
they
have
to
buy
you
a
new
phone
if
they
do
charg
you
and
you
are
found
innoc
they
have
to
buy

will
they
buy
you
a
ticket
on
a

machin
to
allow
you
to
go
back
and
use
the
phone
with
the
new

instead
of
the

whose

they

is
unclear
whether
obtain
the

also
unlock

the

is
believ
by

comment
here
to
break
the
secur
no

more

emerg
so
the
loss
of

whether

oh

expect
will
make

fear
for

thi
