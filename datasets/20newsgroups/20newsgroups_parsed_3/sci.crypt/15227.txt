re
how
to
detect
use
of
an
illeg
cipher
how
can
the
govern
tell
which
encrypt
method
one
is
use
without
be
abl
to
decod
the
traffic
ie
in
order
to
accus
me
of
use
an
unauthor
strong
encrypt
techniqu
they
would
have
to
take
both
key
out
of
escrow
run
them
against
my
ciphertext
and
draw
a
blank
i
wa
think
about
thi
also
it
quit
possibl
the
system
transmit
in
clear
the
serial
number
of
the
devic
be
use
that
way
they
can
start
a
tap
get
the
serial
number
and
use
the
warrant
for
the
first
tap
to
get
the
key
if
they
tap
someon
who
appar
use
encrypt
but
dont
find
that
prefix
then
theyll
assum
it
an
unauthor
encrypt
scheme
thi
doesnt
handl
superencrypt
traffic
if
the
clipper
doesnt
impos
ani
unfortun
perform
sideeffect
there
no
reason
not
to
use
it
to
superencrypt
a
stream
of
tripled
encrypt
traffic
that
way
your
traffic
look
normal
and
perhap
anyon
