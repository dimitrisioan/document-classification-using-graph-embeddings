gutmann
in
dane
c
butzer
write
what
are
the
typic
size
for
key
for
commerci
secret
key
algorithm
i
know
de
is
bit
trippl
de
is
bit
and
idea
is
bit
is
there
anyth
made
in
the
u
that
ha
bit
key
anyth
anywher
that
ha
larger
key
ive
heard
that
rc
can
be
scale
to
arbitrarili
larg
key
but
is
thi
actual
implement
anywher
my
mdc
cipher
which
use
ani
oneway
hash
function
a
a
cfbmode
stream
cipher
the
current
implement
use
md
use
a
key
of
up
to
bit
that
is
you
can
use
a
bit
key
if
you
want
and
copi
it
over
the
entir
bit
rang
or
you
can
use
the
entir
bit
runtim
is
independ
of
key
size
the
system
run
slightli
slower
than
md
itself
i
presum
rc
and
rc
use
a
similar
system
or
possibl
they
just
hash
an
arbitrarylength
key
down
to
n
bit
mayb
use
someth
like
md
