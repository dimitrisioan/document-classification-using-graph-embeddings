dorothi
den
your
read
far
too
much
into
thi
asid
from
the
obviou
fact
that
you
shouldnt
hold
anybodi
to
what
they
wrote
in
a
year
old
book
in
a
rapidli
chang
field
like
thi
quit
simpli
she
say
that
the
secur
should
not
depend
on
the
secreci
of
the
algorithm
a
secret
algorithm
can
still
be
secur
after
all
we
just
dont
know
it
onli
our
level
of
trust
is
affect
not
the
secur
of
the
system
the
algorithm
could
be
rsa
for
all
we
know
which
we
believ
to
be
secur
they
have
a
much
better
reason
to
classifi
the
algorithm
than
to
protect
it
secur
they
want
to
protect
it
market
share
if
they
publish
the
algorithm
then
shortli
manufactur
would
make
chip
that
implement
the
algorithm
and
standard
but
do
not
use
a
key
store
in
escrow
and
of
cours
everybodi
would
buy
them
the
whole
push
of
thi
chip
is
that
by
establish
a
standard
that
you
can
onli
use
if
you
follow
their
rule
they
get
u
to
follow
their
rule
without
enact
new
law
that
we
would
fight
tooth
and
nail
quit
simpli
with

establish
it
would
be
much
harder
for
anoth
encrypt
maker
to
defin
a
new
standard
to
make
phone
that
cant

compani
the
result
is
tappabl
cryptographi
without

forbid
other
kind
for

to

you
would
have
to
build
a

phone
that
run
on

everybodi

would
have
