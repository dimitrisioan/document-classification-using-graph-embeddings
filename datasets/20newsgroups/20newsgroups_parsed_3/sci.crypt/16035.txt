also
allow
an
extraordinari
opportun
for
the
crimin
to
conceal
use
of
superencrypt
an

surveil
mechan
quit
feasibl
across

which
know

f
can
valid

wrapper
and

but
it
can
not
reveal
in
realtim
the
use
of
superencrypt
unless
it
know
all
unit
key
which
we
are
be
assur
are
onli
to
be
made
avail

upon
specif
wiretaplik
order
the
serial
number
will
be
in
a
bit
block
with
a
bit
filler
doesnt
take
a
lot
to
check
to
see
if
that
is
correct
ye
but
the
extra
encrypt
could
be
appli
befor
the
messag
is
encrypt
by
the
clipper
so
that
the
wrapper
would
be
fine
the
phone
serial
number
and
the
session
key
would
be
in
the
lawenforc
field
etc
but
the
messag
wouldnt
be
readabl
even
if
the
particular
clipper
key
were
obtain
from
the
escrow
agent
in
fact
it
shouldnt
even
be
possibl
to
detect
that
a
messag
ha
been
doubleencrypt
without
a
court
order
right
