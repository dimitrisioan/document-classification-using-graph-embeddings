re
sourc
of
random
bit
on
a
unix
workstat
for
your
applic
what
you
can
do
is
to
encrypt
the
realtim
clock
valu
with
a
secret
key
well
almost
if
i
onli
had
to
solv
the
problem
for
myself
and
were
will
to
have
to
type
in
a
second
password
the
secret
key
whenev
i
log
in
it
could
work
howev
im
tri
to
creat
a
solut
that
anyon
can
use
and
which
onc
instal
is
just
a
effortless
to
start
up
a
the
nonsolut
of
just
use
xhost
to
control
access
ive
got
relig
problem
with
store
secret
key
on
multius
comput
for
a

thank
for
the
pointer
it
wa
good
read
and
i
like
the
idea
of
use
sever
unrel
sourc
with
a
strong
mix
function
howev
unless
i
miss
someth
the
onli
sourc
they
suggest
asid
from
a
hardwar
rng
that
seem
avail
and
unguess
by
an
intrud
when
a
unix
is
freshboot
is
io
buffer
relat
to
network
traffic
i
believ
my
solut
basic
us
that
strategi
without
requir
me
to
reach
into
the
kernel
a
reason
sourc
of
random
is
the
output
of
a
cryptograph
hash
function
eg
md
when
fed
with
a
larg
amount
of
moreorless
random
data
for
exampl
run
md
on
devmem
is
a
slow
but
random
enough
sourc
of
random
bit
there
are
bound
to
be
bit
of
entropi
in
the
ten
or
hundr
of
megabyt
of
data
in
a
modern
workstat
memori
a
a
fair
amount
of
them
are
system
timer
io
buffer
etc
i
heard
about
thi
solut
and
it
sound
good
then
i
heard
that
folk
were
experienc
time
of
second
to
run
thi
on
reasonablyconfigur
workstat
im
not
will
to
add
that
much
delay
to
someon
login
process
my
approach
etherfindcompress
skip
k
take
a
second
or
two
to
run
im
consid
write
the
beall
and
endal
of
solut
that
launch
the
md
and
simultan
tri
to
suck
bit
off
the
net
and
if
the
net
should
be
sit
so
idl
that
it
cant
get
k
after
compress
befor
md
finish
use
the
md
thi
way
i
could
have
guarante
good
bit
and
a
determinist
upper
bound
on
login
time
and
still
have
the
common
case
of
login
take
onli
a
coupl
of
extra
second
