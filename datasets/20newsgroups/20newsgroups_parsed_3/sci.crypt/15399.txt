david

write
though
some
may
argu
about
the
nose
of
the
camel
it
worth
note
that
the
govern
propos
is
limit
to
scrambl
telephoni
if
it
is
onli
use
for
that
purpos
and
doe
not
extend
to
electron
mail
or
file
a
usual
david
sternlight
is
demonstr
hi
inabl
to
read
the
propos
clearli
state
the
initi
will
involv
the
creation
of
new
product
to
acceler
the
develop
and
use
of
advanc
and
secur
telecommun
network
and
wireless
commun
link
it
speak
about
telecommun
in
gener
read
it
again
david
mayb
youll
understand
it
the
next
time
nah
probabl
not
encrypt
then
it
is
an
improv
over
the
current
massproduc
standard
civilian
technolog
which
with
a
few
except
is
limit
to
easytobreak
invert
that
exactli
what
the
govern
want
all
sheepmind
peopl
to
think
let
look
at
the
current
situat
it
allow
to
almost
anybodi
to
eavesdrop
almost
everybodi
unless
secur
and
i
mean
secur
encrypt
is
use
what
will
happen
when
if
ha
optimist
the
new
propos
get
accept
almost
nobodi
except
some
will
be
abl
to
eavesdrop
everybodi
el
but
the
abil
of
these
some
to
eavesdrop
will
be
guarante
the
propos
emphas
on
the
former
almost
nobodi
which
is
clearli
an
improv
and
forget
to
mention
the
drawback
of
the
latter
guarante
ye
my
statement
assum
that
the
next
step
will
be
to
make
the
strong
crypto
unlaw
you
think
that
it
will
not
happen
good
luck
note
that
the
big
issu
for
the
fed
is
the
continu
abil
to
wiretap
it
not
just
continu
abil
it
guarante
abil
befor
we
go
off
the
deep
end
with
long
discus
about
secur
crypto
for
email
and
file
let
focu
on
thi
yeah
that
exactli
what
your
govern
want
you
to
think
let
take
small
step
one
at
a
time
concentr
on
the
current
one
dont
think
about
the
futur
trust
u
one
question
that
wa
not
ask
in
the
releas
is
whether
thi
propos
is
limit
to
telephoni
or
if
the
govern
intend
to
expand
it
it
not
ask
becaus
the
propos
clearli
say
that
thi
is
the
intent
they
unlik
you
read
what
they
write
though
i
share
mani
of
the
concern
express
by
some
i
find
the
propos
le
threaten
than
mani
other
sinc
right
now
most
american
have
no
secur
telephoni
and
ani
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
lead
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
thi
would
also
plug
up
the
secur
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phone
ye
it
will
it
will
stop
the
jerk
who
is
eavesdrop
now
it
will
allow
onli
to
the
govern
to
eavesdrop
if
the
scheme
is
secur
of
cours
which
is
yet
to
be
proven
but
how
do
you
know
that
the
jerk
you
are
fear
now
will
not
get
a
govern
job
tomorrow
the
new
propos
guarante
him
the
abil
to
eavesdrop
then
hell
that
will
even
motiv
him
to
get
that
job
if
he
inde
is
that
mental
pervert
read
between
the
line
i
infer
that
the
system
is
highli
secur
without
access
to
the
key
great
the
greatest
cryptograph
of
all
time
david
sternlight
tm
ha
succeed
to
evalu
the
new
system
in
the
absens
of
ani
detail
whatsoev
and
ha
conclud
that
it
is
highli
secur
i
guess
that
come
from
the
background
of
work
some
year
for
the
two
major
crypto
evalu
compani
right
gee
now
the
govern
can
save
all
that
money
and
troubl
to
ask
a
secret
council
of
crypto
expert
to
secretli
analys
the
new
secret
method
for
david
sternlight
ha
alreadi
done
all
the
job
for
them
thi
would
meet
the
need
of
u
busi
confront
by
rich
and
power
adversari
includ
french
and
japanes
secur
servic
and
rich
japanes
compani
it
allow
the
nsa
to
make
avail
some
of
it
better
stuff
while
protect
law
enforc
need
trust
u
were
from
the
govern
and
were
here
to
help
you
most
legitim
u
corpor
trust
the
nsa
and
would
be
delight
to
have
a
highsecur
system
certifi
by
them
even
at
the
price
of
deposit
key
in
escrow
i
see
no
difficulti
in
creat
a
reliabl
those
who
are
prepar
to
trade
their
liberti
for
the
promis
of
futur
safeti
do
not
deserv
either
thi
or
someth
like
that
i
dont
have
the
exact
quot
but
the
mean
is
the
same
ha
been
said
by
one
of
your
great
men
mayb
you
should
studi
their
work
more
care
if
you
have
the
brain
to
understand
them
of
cours
from
my
point
of
view
thi
is
a
fair
start
point
there
are
concern
that
need
to
be
address
includ
the
reliabl
of
the
escrow
but
in
the
main
question
is
to
guarante
to
avail
of
realli
secur
cryptographi
to
the
mass
gee
if
the
propos
wa
say
we
guarante
that
everi
american
will
still
have
the
full
right
to
use
ani
kind
of
encrypt
she
would
like
and
regard
thi
propos
a
just
a
default
voluntari
implement
there
would
have
been
much
le
opposit
for
some
reason
they
didnt
even
tri
to
promis
you
that
i
wonder
whi
wa
orwel
off
onli
by
year
return
we
get
access
to
highsecur
crypto
no
in
return
you
get
crypto
that
is
guarante
to
be
crippl
mani
have
suggest
that
de
and
other
system
may
be
breakabl
by
the
nsa
and
henc
other
similarli
skill
and
endow
while
the
abov
is
just
rumor
and
while
even
if
it
is
true
it
is
not
done
easili
the
new
scheme
can
is
guarante
to
be
easili
breakabl
by
anybodi
who
ha
the
two
key
it
might
be
also
breakabl
by
somebodi
who
doe
not
have
them
but
know
the
right
trick
or
who
ha
onli
one
of
them
nsa
also
told
you
that
de
is
secur
whi
dont
you
simpli
trust
them
huh
there
is
at
least
a
good
possibl
which
should
be
check
that
the
propos
system
is
not
so
breakabl
it
doesnt
have
to
it
is
guarante
to
be
easili
breakabl
just
get
the
key
it
might
be
even
easier
but
until
there
is
some
evid
thi
is
just
a
wild
specul
be
nor
doe
it
have
to
have
trapdoor
if
the
govern
can
get
the
key
the
trapdoor
are
there
in
govern
hand
the
key
pursuant
to
a
legitim
court
order
thu
they
can
protect
legitim
commun
against
econom
adversari
while
still
be
abl
to
eavesdrop
on
crook
pursuant
to
a
court
order
legitim
and
who
decid
what
commun
are
legitim
oh
i
guess
it
the
govern
right
the
guy
who
alreadi
have
the
key
it
kinda
if
i
have
the
key
from
your
car
and
i
am
ask
to
