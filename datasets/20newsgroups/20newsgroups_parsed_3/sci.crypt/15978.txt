the
cop
send
the
lef
to
the

and
send
ukn
to
the

say
u
i
say
k
the
cop
cant
use
u
in
the
futur
becaus
they
cant
strip
off
f
the
fholder
never
see
u
in
don
model
the
escrow
agent
cant
read
the
traffic
becaus
they
dont
have
k
in
my
model
they
have
k
but
not
the
messag
itself
and
i
trust
that
more
becaus
i
think
the
cop

the
fbi
the
fholder
are
more
like
to
collabor
on
break
the
rule

net
result
is
that
