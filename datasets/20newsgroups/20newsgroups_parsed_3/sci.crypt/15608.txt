ha
been

design
that
the

develop
is
there
a

is
that
patent
publicli
avail
my
bet
is
that
that
too
is
classifi
unless
there
ha
been
a
major
chang
in
the
law
there
no
such
beast
a
a

patent
exist

while
there
arent

there
are

order
suppos
you
invent
a

a

the

the
nsa
might
be
interest
give
them
a
copi

your
applic
and
you
get
a
nice
note
back
say
your
patent
applic
ha
now
been
classifi
for
nation
secur
reason
and
your
no
longer
allow
to
make
and
sell
it
im
pick
thi
exampl
becaus
it
happen
in

s
it
wa
probabl
some
analog
scrambler
and
would
have
probabl
violat
fcc
rule
anyway
but
it
did
get
classifi
or
suppos
you
publish
a
paper
on
your
realli
spiffi
algorithm
and
then
file
a
patent
applic
sinc
it
been
publish
they
cant
gain
anyth
by
classifi
it
though
you
cant
get
patent
in
most
countri
other
than
the

differ
obvious
a
system
of
classifi
patent
would
be
highli
bogu
you
cant

becaus
there
a
classifi
patent
on
it
your
not
allow
to
see
the

or
know
who
own
the

so
just
give

all
your

and
mayb
we
wont
throw
you
in
