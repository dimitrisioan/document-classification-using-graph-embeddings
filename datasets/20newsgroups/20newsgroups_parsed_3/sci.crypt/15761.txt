background
until

happen
to

a

could
soon
make
it
liter
imposs
to
overhear
a

without

in
order
to
preserv
the
abil
of

enforc
agenc
to
tap

convers
the
u
govern
announc
on
april
that
it
had
develop
and
begun
manufactur
a
special
wiretap
chip
to
be
place
in

phone
instead
of
the
total
privaci
chip
which
have
been
under

develop
the

day
att
announc
it
would
use
these
chip
in

it
secur
telephon
product
each

would
be
creat
under

when
it
would
be
given
a

most
concern
voic
about
thi
plan
have
been
about
it
secur
the
govern
wont
disclos
the
encrypt

and
mani
suspect
the

will
not
limit
it
access
in
the
way
it
ha
claim
the
track
record
of
previou
govern
doe
not
inspir
confid
on
thi
point
howev
thi
paper
will
neglect
these
concern
and
ask
instead
whether
thi
new
wiretap
chip
is
a
costeffect
tool
for
polic
investig
that
is
which
is
a
cheaper
way
for
societi
to
investig
crime
forc
phone
commun
to
support
wiretap
or
give
polic
agenc
more
money
to
investig
crime
in
other
way
or
to
put
it
anoth
way
would
polic
agenc
be
will
to
pay
for
each
wiretap
if
they
had
to
pay
their
share
of
the
full
social
cost
of
forc
phone
to
support
wiretap
to
start
to
answer
thi
question
we
might
compar
the
current
benefit
wiretap
provid
to
law
enforc
agenc
with
project
cost
of
implement
the
new
wiretap
chip
plan
and
sinc
current
benefit
are
easier
to
estim
we
begin
there
wiretap
benefit
is
the
latest
year
for
which
wiretap
statist
are
avail
in
that
year
wiretap
instal
were
request
and
no
request
were
deni
thi
figur
doe
not
includ
wiretap
obtain
with
the
consent
of
a
parti
to
the
convers
arrest
result
from
wiretap
start
the
same
year
arrest
came
from
wiretap
in
previou
year
and
of
arrest
led
to
convict
of
the
wiretap
were
for
phone
v
pager
email
etc
were
regard
drug
offens
and
were
request
by
feder
author
each
wiretap
instal
heard
an
averag
of
call
of
them
incrimin
among
peopl
and
cost
an
averag
of
extrapol
from
the
instal
report
cost
mostli
for
labor
thu
a
total
of
about
million
wa
spent
on
wiretap
to
obtain
about
arrest
at
per
arrest
thu
these
arrest
are
at
least
four
time
more
expens
than
the
per
arrest
figur
one
get
by
divid
the
billion
spent
by
all
polic
nation
by
the
total
million
nontraff
arrest
thu
the
million
per
year
spent
on
phone
tap
is
onli
one
thousanth
of
the
total
polic
expenditur
and
if
we
divid
thi
by
the
million
phone
access
line
in
the
countri
we
get
about
cent
spent
per
year
per
phone
line
or
about
two
cent
a
month
in
gener
we
deter
a
given
class
of
crimin
through
a
combin
of
a
perceiv
probabl
of
be
caught
and
convict
and
some
expect
punish
level
if
convict
so
the
social
valu
of
have
wiretap
is
no
more
than
the
amount
that
we
would
have
to
pay
to
get
the
same
crimin
deterr
through
other
mean
if
unabl
to
wiretap
a
particular
suspect
phone
polic
might
instead
use
hidden
microphon
or
investig
that
suspect
in
other
way
or
polic
might
focu
on
suspect
more
easili
investig
without
wiretap
or
we
might
rais
the
fine
or
prison
time
for
certain
type
of
crime
if
we
gener
assum
that
these
substitut
for
wiretap
would
be
on
averag
twice
a
expens
a
wiretap
then
the
annual
social
benefit
of
phone
wiretap
is
about
equal
to
the
current
spend
level
of
two
cent
a
month
per
phone
line
wiretap
cost
let
u
for
the
moment
optimist
assum
that
the
u
govern
encrypt
scheme
is
a
secur
a
whatev
privat
enterpris
would
have
offer
instead
protect
our
convers
from
the

ear
of
neighbor
corpor
and
govern
both
foreign
and
domest
even
so
the
need
to
support
wiretap
would
add
mani
addit
cost
to

extra

are
now

the
rel
high

of

though

when

how

le
effici
is
a
matter
of

some
say
they
pay
twice
a
much
while
other
might
say
onli
more
current
a
total
of

is
spent
a
oper
expens
of
u
phone
compani
which
come
out
to
about
per
month
per

line
if
we
compar
thi
to
the
wiretap
valu
of
two
cent
per

we
see
that
if
wiretap
rais
averag
oper
cost
by
even
a
much
a
one
part
in
then
wiretap
are
not
cost
effect
and
thi
doesnt
even
includ
extra
cost
phone
owner
pay
becaus
their
encrypt
chip
are
more
expens
of
cours
most
phone
wouldnt
have
encrypt
chip
for
a
while
but
the
wiretap
benefit
per
phone
is
still
the
same
so
thi
argument
still
appli
conclus
given
thi
dramat
differ
between
the
total
cost
of
run
the
phone
system
and
the
valu
of
wiretap
we
can
justifi
onli
the
slightest
modif

to
allow

wire
wiretap
support
may
have
been
reason
but
when

consid
substanti
modif
the
burden
of

is
clearli
on

such

the

if

estim
a

might
be
to

five
