onetim
pad
authent
i
can
think
of
a
coupl
of
way
of
guarante
authent
in
a
onetim
pad
encrytp
scheme
though
im
not
sure
how
to
prove
that
what
kind
of
authen
they
provid
an
obviou
firstattempt
might
be
to
prepend
a
truli
random
unpredict
for
eve
block
to
the
messag
and
then
calcul
a
crc
which
includ
the
random
start
block
and
all
of
the
messag
thi
could
be
encrypt
after
the
messag
the
problem
is
im
not
sure
it
imposs
to
come
up
with
a
messag
that
will
hash
to
the
same
crc
regardless
of
the
random
start
block
it
intuit
seem
like
it
ought
to
be
hard
but
im
not
that
sure
clearli
a
cryptostrength
hash
like
md
or
the
sha
would
be
stronger
but
again
im
not
sure
im
comfort
claim
that
it
unbreak
a
scheme
to
use
up
some
of
the
pad
bit
to
decid
how
mani
bit
of
s
to
includ
in
the
plaintext
stream
befor
go
on
wouldnt
be
too
bad
either
at
the
cost
of
increas
the
speed
with
which
you
use
up
your
pad
thi
could
be
use
to
give
you
arbitrarili
low
probabl
that
your
oppon
could
spoof
a
validlook
messag
sinc
ani
deciph
plaintext
in
a
spot
that
should
be
carri
s
will
show
that
someth
funni
go
on
if
for
each
messag
bit
mi
we
use
up
one
random
bit
ri
to
decid
whether
to
insert
a
into
the
plaintext
stream
wed
get
a
total
pad
use
of
time
the
messag
length
wed
expand
the
messag
size
by
about
half
each
that
should
appear
in
the
plaintext
stream
that
doesnt
is
a
guess
for
our
wouldb
spoofer
at
each
bit
she
ha
to
guess
im
tri
to
see
how
to
quantifi
her
chanc
of
make
it
all
the
way
through
the
spoof
messag
but
it
get
a
littl
complic
becaus
she
can
get
un
synch
and
still
happen
to
have
a
in
that
place
in
the
spoof
messag
now
i
can
see
a
simpl
way
of
do
thi
that
got
to
be
a
secur
a
a
onetim
pad
at
a
cost
of
use
time
the
messag
length
in
pad
bit
for
each
messag
bit
mi
use
one
random
bit
ri
and
xor
them
togeth
to
get
xi
now
encrypt
the
three
bit
with
the
onetim
pad
the
enemi
ha
no
way
of
guess
what
ri
is
so
hesh
cant
guess
what
xi
is
either
ani
chang
she
make
in
the
ciphertext
stream
will
have
to
involv
a
guess
of
what
ri
wa
is
there
ani
way
to
do
thi
without
use
so
mani
pad
bit
spoof
the
messag
is
equival
to
correctli
guess
a
mani
random
bit
a
there
are
bit
in
the
messag
clearli
thi
make
spoof
messag
just
a
hard
if
you
know
the
whole
messag
text
a
if
you
know
none
of
it
in
fact
it
look
to
me
like
thi
make
it
just
a
hard
to
gener
a
spoof
messag
with
the
ciphertext
a
without
it
but
im
not
entir
sure
about
that
is
there
an
easier
way
of
do
thi
that
provabl
a
secur
a
the
onetim
pad
