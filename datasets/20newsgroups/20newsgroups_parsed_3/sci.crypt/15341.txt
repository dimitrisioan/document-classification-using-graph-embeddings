re
the
sourc
of
that
announc
in
articl
timothi
c
may
write
i
know
that
at
least
one
person
on
that
list
say
the
first
he
heard
of
clipper
wa
in
the
friday
morn
newspap
and
anoth
ha
alreadi
fire
off
a
letter
of
protest
to
nist
my
point
i
suspect
thi
list
interest
a
it
is
for
variou
reason
doe
not
repres
the
cabal
that
put
thi
propos
togeth
some
of
them
ye
other
no
i
receiv
mail
from
mitch
kapor
say
that
he
did
not
ask
to
be
on
the
list
and
doe
not
know
whi
he
wa
ad
im
sure
the
same
appli
to

just
someon
idea
of
a
bad
joke
