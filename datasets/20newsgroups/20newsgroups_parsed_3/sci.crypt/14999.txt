write
how
about
thi
i
creat
a
bunch
of
set
of
random
data
and
encrypt
it
i
keep
onli
one
of
the
set
of
random
data
around
to
show
that
i
encypt
random
data
for
kick
the
rest
i
delet
with
their
key
i
tell
all
my
friend
i
think
thi
establish
reason
doubt
about
the
content
of
ani
encrypt
file
and
my
abil
to
provid
key
sinc
anyon
could
do
thi
ani
law
that
forc
a
user
to
provid
key
on
demand
is
worthless
the
law
is
much
wors
than
worthless
it
give
polic
the
power
to
put
innoc
peopl
in
jail
becaus
they
the
polic
find
someth
they
dont
understand
most
polic
dont
know
what
the
return
key
doe
never
mind
the
differ
between
a
core
file
and
classifi
militari
secret
there
are
plenti
of
scenario
where
the
user
would
have
no
idea
what
someth
is
either
it
could
be
uniniti
junk
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
user
to
show
that
it
someth
a
normal
upstand
citizen
should
have
no
one
should
ever
be
put
in
that
situat
especi
in
america
what
disgust
about
thi
is
how
easili
most
peopl
go
along
with
it
to
provid
a
bargain
chip
against
some
hypothet
alleg
child
molest
or
drug
dealer
or
whatev
bad
thing
is
in
style
at
the
time
basic
most
peopl
dont
have
a
clear
distinct
between
crimin
and
suspect
a
an
analog
it
like
they
find
a
loos
screw
in
your
hous
and
they
insist
that
your
build
a
bomb
or
machin
gun
they
ask
you
where
it
came
from
like
youd
know
and
ask
you
to
prove
your
claim
when
you
explain
it
in
such
simpl
term
peopl
may
start
to
get
the
idea
a
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
keep
random
file
on
my
disk
the
reason
is
without
specialpurpos
hardwar
it
take
a
long
time
to
gener
good
random
bit
i
have
program
that
crank
out
a
coupl
bit
per
minut
which
is
pretti
conserv
but
over
time
that
more
than
i
need
if
you
think
about
it
there
no
point
in
actual
encrypt
random
data
becaus
it
just
give
you
differ
random
data
if
you
want
some
data
to
look
like
an
encrypt
file
you
just
put
an
appropri
header
on
it
if
enough
peopl
do
thi
some
of
them
will
be
put
in
jail
when
you
get
arrest
and
the
polic
ask
for
your
key
you
can
tell
them
it
just
random
junk
although
of
cours
they
wont
believ
you
while
your
sit
in
jail
you
can
take
consol
in
the
fact
that
the
govern
will
burn
a
few
cpuyear
tri
to
find
someth
that
not
there
