thank
you
for
send
me
a
most
interest
articl
a
societi
of
individu
and
organ
that
would
expend
the
time
and
resourc
to
use
a
seri
of
digit
pseudonym
to
avoid
data
linkag
doe
not
in
my
opinion
make
big
brother
obsolet
but
act
on
the
assumpt
that
big
brother
is
ever
present
i
view
your
system
a
a
form
of
societ
paranoia
a
a
matter
of
principl
we
are
work
to
enact
formal
legal
protect
for
individu
privaci
rather
than
reli
on
technic
solut
we
want
to
assum
a
societi
of
law
which
respect
legal
limit
rather
than
a
societi
that
will
disobey
the
law
requir
citizen
to
depend
on
technic
solut
eg
requir
a
judic
warrant
for
govern
intercept
of
data
commun
rather
than
encrypt
all
messag
on
the
assumpt
that
regardless
of
the
lawt
the
govern
will
abus
it
power
and
invad
privaci
a
a
matter
of
practic
i
do
not
think
your
system
offer
much
hope
for
privaci
first
the
trend
toward
univers
identifi
is
a
mucha
movement
gener
by
govern
or
industri
desir
to
keep
track
of
all
citizen
a
it
is
by
citizen
seek
simplic
and
conveni
in
all
transact
at
best
your
system
would
benefit
the
sophist
and
most
would
opt
for
simplic
the
poor
and
the
undereduc
would
never
use
or
benefit
from
it
final
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
if
govern
want
to
link
data
base
it
will
by
law
requir
the
disclosur
of
variou
individu
pseudonym
use
by
citizen
or
prohibit
it
for
data
base
which
the
govern
want
to

list
with
one
anoth
they
will
never
adopt
