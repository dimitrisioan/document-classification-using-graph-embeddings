i
tri
thi
code
yesterday
on
my
sparcstat
elc
it
take
over
second
to
compress
second
worth
of
speech
thi
mean
that
it
need
to
be
optim
by
over
a
factor
of

it
will
be
usabl
in
even
a

ouch
thank
for
tri
it
i
question
whether
celp
is
the
best
approach
for
thi
applic
it
produc
great
compress
but
at
the
expens
of
tremend
cpu
load
we
want
someth
that
can
be
run
on
ordinari
workstat
or
even
highend
pc
without
dsp
card
my
guess
is
that
some
other
algorithm
is
go
to
be
a
better
start
point
ye
im
not
sure
if
my
