not
compromis
de

tripl
de
a
a
better
one
what
follow
is
my
opinion
it
is
not
assert
to
be
the
truth
so
no
flame
plea
it
come
out
of
a
background
of
year
a
a
senior
corpor
staff
execut
in
two
fortun
compani
no
wonder
american
busi
are
go
down
the
tube
id
be
happi
to
use
a
crypto
system
suppli
by
the
nsa
for
busi
if
they
told
me
it
wa
more
secur
than
de
and
in
particular
resist
to
attempt
by
japanes
french
and
other
competit
compani
and
govern
to
break
it
nist
not
nsa
nsa
is
not
suppos
to
have
anyth
to
do
with
thi
they
didnt
say
that
they
said
is
wa
better
than
some
commercialgrad
encrypt
i
for
one
wouldnt
trust
them
if
they
did
unless
they
releas
the
algorithm
for
investig
id
be
happi
to
do
so
even
with
escrow
key
provid
i
wa
happi
about
the
bona

of
the

agenc
the
feder
reserv
would
certainli

a
would
someth
set
up
by
one
of
the
big

firm
mayb
the

and
eff
it
would
have
to
be
a

so
the
big
would
be
out
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the

if
they
state
there
were
no
trap
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a

examin
the

under

and
report
back
that
it
wa
secur
i
wouldnt

i
think
i
would
