steve

write
a
wellthoughtout
and
nearli
persuas
articl
about
whi
the
clipper
are
we
still
call
it
clipper
today
or
have
they
figur
out
a
noninfring
word
yet
protocol
is
almost
a
good
a
one
can
do
given
their
march
ord
in
articl
steven
bellovin
write
i
issu
thi
invit
assum
that
you
were
charg
with
implement
such
a
system
with
complet
regard
for
civil
right
and
due
process
what
would
you
do
differ
in
answer
thi
question
plea
accept
nsa
fundament
assumpt
that
both
strong
cryptographi
against
outsid
and
the
abil
to
wiretap
some
domest
user
is
necessari
ill
accept
the
second
assumpt
onli
for
the
sake
of
argument
in
my
view
the
primari
remain
flaw
is
that
the
encrypt
algorithm
is
secret
lead
to
suspicion
that
there
is
a
back
door
without
complet
disclosur
thi
suspicion
can
not
be
dispel
no
matter
how
mani
trust
expert
are
allow
to
look
at
it
in
isol
is
it
possibl
to
do
thi
whole
thing
with
a
public
algorithm
the
onli
concern
ive
seen
with
make
skipjack
public
is
that
someon
could
build
clipperphon
without
regist
the
key
assum
f
can
realli
be
kept
secret
a
the
govern
assum
then
a
part
of
the
initi
connect
a
clipperphon
execut
a
protocol
with
the
pseudophon
to
demonstr
that
they
both
know
f
for
exampl
the
initi
phone
pick
a
number
q
and
send
eq
f
the
receiv
send
back
eq
f
and
the
initi
send
back
eq
f
to
demonstr
that
her
first
packet
wasnt
just
a
random
bit
block
repeat
in
the
opposit
direct
with
anoth
q
so
it
cant
be
defeat
by
somebodi
build
up
a
librari
of
sequenti
number
by
rememb
respons
and
use
those
respons
a
the
initi
number
of
subsequ
challeng
thi
way
clipperphon
will
talk
onli
to
other
clipperphon
of
cours
the
pseudo
compani
can
build
their
own
proprietari
skipjack
phone
but
the
presidenti
fact
sheet
impli
that
they
wont
get
approv
for
it
without
equival
key
escrow
what
wrong
with
thi
pictur
it
depend
of
f
stay
secret
and
on
skipjack
be
resist
to
cryptanalysi
but
the
govern
appear
to
believ
in
both
of
these
even
if
the
particular
qa
i
suggest
ha
some
flaw
i
imagin
there
a
zeroknowledgeproof
protocol
that
doesnt
smb
say
the
third
and
most
seriou
issu
is
whether
or
not
clipper
is
a
good
idea
even
if
carri
out
strictli
accord
to
the
letter
of
the
law
agre
my
view
and
you
can
quot
me
if
it
not
worth
do
it
not
worth
do
well
