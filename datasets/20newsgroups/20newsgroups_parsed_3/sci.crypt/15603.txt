normal
a

rememb
these
are
the
folk
who
couldnt
cope
with
digit
telephoni
and
hear
a
load
of
modemlik
tone
we
are
talk
analogu
telephoni
here
what
next
what
modul
scheme
do
these
clipper
box
use
is
it
possibl
to
record
the
tone
for
use
after
the
key
are
obtain
i
thought
it
wa
quit
difficult
to
record
a
modem
session
at
some
intermedi
point
on
the
line
mayb
they
have
taken
a
crash
cours
in
data
comm
and
have
a
unit
that
demodul
the
tone
and
store
the
digit
stream
for
decrypt
later
thi
would
still
suffer
from
the
same
problem
a
tri
to
record
the
tone
a
the
demodul
would
not
be
at
one
end
of
the
line
if
call
cant
be
record
for
decrypt
later
it
would
be
quit
easi
to
foil
the
system
by
buy
lot
of
clipper
unit
these
are
suppos
to
be
cheap
mass
market
item
and
use
them
in
turn
how
toler
is
the
modul
scheme
to
error
these
thing
are
propos
for
use
by
u
corpor
to
secur
their
foreign
offic
where
phone
line
qualiti
may
well
be
poor
it
seem
hard
enough
to
me
to
get
digitis
speech
of
ani
qualiti
into
someth
a
modem
can
handl
without
have
to
add
lot
of
error
correct
to
keep
the
decrypt
in
sync
q
will
the
devic
be
export
will
other
devic
that
use
the
govern
hardwar
a
voic
encrypt
devic
are
subject
to

control
requir
one
of
the
attract
of
thi
technolog
is
the
protect
it
can
give
to
u
compani
oper
at
home

abroad
with
thi
in
mind
we
expect
export
licens
will
be

seek
to

thi
rais
an
interst
question
in
the
uk
here
it
is
illeg
to
connect
anyth

a
public
telecomm
network
without
it
be
approv
by
a

babt
it
ha
been
state
either
here
or
in
the
uktelecom
group
that
they
will
not
approv
equip
that
doe
encrypt
i
dont
know
if
thi
is
true
or
not

thi
would
make
a
good
test
case
perhap
friendli
