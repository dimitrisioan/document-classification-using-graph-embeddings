discuss
i
give
a
summari
on
my
recent
question
in
articl
i
wrote
the
recent
discuss
in
thi
news
group
suggest
that
a
key
search
attack
against
de
is
quit
feasibl
now
but
normal
de
is
appli
in
cbc
or
cfb
mode
where
one
choos
a
random
init
vector
of
byte
question
make
it
sens
to
handl
the
init
vector
a
an
addit
key
then
we
have
a
bit
key
if
ye
is
anyth
known
about
the
secur
of
thi
key
scheme
can
we
break
it
faster
than
by
exhaust
search
through
the
bit
key
space
unfortun
the
answer
is
no
conceal
the
initialis

essenti
doesnt
give
ani
addit

i
got
answer
from
that
open

it

work
by
