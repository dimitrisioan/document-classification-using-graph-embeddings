do
we
need
the

cheap
secur
graham
toal
write
can
someon
tell
me
if
hardwar
compress
is
or
is
not
need
to
run
digit
speech
down
k
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
it
not
let
say
bit
sampl
would
raw
data
at
the
correspond
sampl
rate
be
usabl
if
not
how
fanci
doe
the
compress
need
to
be
a
good
vocod
like
our
will
give
you
bit
per
second
lock
at
full
rate
it
a
variabl
rate
voic
activ
vocod
if
you
want
le
qualiti
cut
that
to
bp
half
rate
at
full
rate
variabl
you
could
put
two
fullduplex
convers
on
a
vbi
modem
thi
requir
a
dsp
or
asic
though
an
r
ha
a
cpu
that
could
probabl
do
it
in
realtim
becaus
it
ha
the
addandmultipli
instruct
and
a
few
other
dsp
thing
if
you
want
to
do
speech
in
realtim
you
need
about
sampl
a
second
for
not
veri
good
voic
with
your
bit
sampl
isdn
is
bit
sampl
a
second
which
is
kbp
you
could
do
a
fast
compress
on
that
to
get
it
down
to
kbp
which
is
just
about
vbi
the
qualiti
at
thi
point
is
veri
bleah
but
it
should
work
now
add
in
the
time
for
your
encrypt
method
your
go
to
need
sampl
hardwar
which
is
no
problem
on
a
new
mac
an
amiga
or
a
pc
with
a
soundblast
card
just
becaus
theyr
so
popular
and
cheap
you
could
also
build
a
simpl
adc
the
problem
with
the
soundblast
is
that
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
full
duplex
you
cant
sampl
and
play
backq
at
the
same
time
make
a
twoway
convers
a
bit
tough
the
special
hardwar
or
a
more
capabl
sound
card
may
be
requir
the
onli
thing
that
worri
me
is
that
compress
the
soundblast
can
do
it
automat
in
hardwar
but
other
than
that
i
dont
have
a
good
feel
for
how
processor
intens
it
is
so
i
cant
estim
how
fast
a
pc
youd
need
not
all
men
who
drink
are
poet
some
of
u
drink
becaus
we
are
not
poet
