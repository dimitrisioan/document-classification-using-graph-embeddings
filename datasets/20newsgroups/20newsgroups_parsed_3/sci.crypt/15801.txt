i
wa
annoy
to
find

post
my

sinc
i
believ
what

theyr
bet
that
you
cant
cryptanalyz
e
to
get

given

but
we
cant
do
thi
right
now
with
de
even
know
the
encrypt
method
without
do
almost
the
whole
bit
search
that
is
not
true
with
chosen
plaintext
attack
de
key
can
be
determin
without
the
full
search
by
almost
i
mean
the
differenti
cryptanalysi
attack
the
chosen
plaintext
attack
requir
a
detail
analysi
of
about
chosen
plaintext
drawn
from
a
total
of
about
that
need
to
be
run
if
i
understand
the
situat
correctli
thi
is
certainli
a
break
under
the
mean
of
the
act
but
doe
not
constitut
much
le
work
than
the
brute
forc
keysearch
the
rest
of
hi
articl
assum
that
we
can
figur
out
the
skipjack
encrypt
algorithm
e
by
choos
the
correct
data
to
send
through
it
and
observ
the
result
i
wish
him
joy
of
it
and
choos
not
to
tri
that
attack
i
am
not
defend
the
system
and
in
fact
am
offend
by
the
idea
of
escrow
key
or
a
secret
algorithm
becom
a
de
facto
industri
standard
howev
i
also
object
to
oppos
it
for
the
wrong
reason
sinc
that
weaken
the
case
against
it
i
said
in
my
privat
email
it
not
clear
that
the
expert
will
be
told
f
in
fact
id
be
surpris
id
expect
someth
more
of
the
form
of
the
fip
pub
describ
de
so
that
they
could
look
at
the
algorithm
in
gener
rather
than
with
the
specif
set
of
key
chosen
oh
come
on
that
like
say
you
could
evalu
de
without
the
sbox
constant
no
it
quit
differ
the
govern
would
have
no
percentag
in
choos
f
to
be
a
weak
key
sinc
it
not
to
their
advantag
to
have
anybodi
el
know
it
the
expert
could
thu
assum
that
f
is
no
wors
than
anyth
el
dure
their
analysi
total
differ
situat
from
unknown
sbox
again
im
not
say
it
would
be
good
or
satisfactori
for
the
expert
to
just
be
given
the
raw
algorithm
without
the
rest
of
the
surround
detail
regard
the
chip
and
protocol
and
so
on
simpli
that
i
doubt
that
they
would
be
given
all
