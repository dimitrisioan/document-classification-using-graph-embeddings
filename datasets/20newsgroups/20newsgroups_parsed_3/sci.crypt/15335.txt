to
me
that
if
they
get
a
wiretap
order
on
you
and
the
escrow
hous
releas
your
code
to
the
cop
your
code
is
now
no
longer
secur
a
veri
good
point
it
in
the
hand
of
cop
and
while
i
am
sure
most
of
the
time
they
are
good
their
secur
will
not
be
a
good
a
the
escrow
hous
whi
should
we
expect
the
cop
to
be
honest
theyr
underpaid
for
the
risk
they
face
everi
day
the
medium
dump
on
the
all
the
time
and
blame
them
for
all
sort
of
discrimin
brutal
how
can
we
expect
them
to
be
more
than
human

a
breakin
at

local
radio
shack
and
the
alarm
compani
heard
the
cop
respond
to
the
call
