whi
the
clipper
algorithm
is
secret
the
cryptograph
protocol
though
is
anoth
matter
i
see
no
valid
reason
for
keep
it
secret
and
a
i
hope
ive
shown
abov
there
are
a
lot
of
way
to
do
thing
that
arent
quit
a
bad
it
just
occur
to
me
whi
the
algorithm
is
secret
if
it
were
publish
one
could
then
build
physic
ident
clone
version
of
the
chip
that
would
interoper
with
offici
clipper
chip
but
the
cloner
wouldnt
provid
the
key
to
the
escrow
hous
hmmn
or
is
there
a
technic
hack
that
ive
miss
eg
how
about
if
the
chip
were
made
unprogram
but
serial
and
then
ship
to
the
two
escrow
hous
who
program
in
their
halv
of
the
key
but
in
a
way
that
requir
that
secret
key
known
onli
to
the
escrow
hous
be
instal
a
well
without
which
clone
version
wouldnt
interoper
thi
is
get
aw
