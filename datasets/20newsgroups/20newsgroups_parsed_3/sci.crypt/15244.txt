what
is
an

in
intuit
term
a
passiv
attack
on
a
cryptosystem
is
ani
method
of

with
some

their

under
some
unknown
key
and
figur
out
more

it
possibl
to
state
mathemat
what
thi
mean
here
we
go

and
h

variabl
fix
an

and
fix
a
distribut

an

p
is
an

such
that
there
is

of

if
we
have
f

note
that
thi
probabl

the
attack
is

and
so
on
what
the
advantag
of
formul
all
thi
mathemat
in
basic
cryptolog
you
can
never
prove
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secur
read
part
we
keep
say
a
strong
cryptosystem
must
have
thi
properti
but
have
thi
properti
is
no
guarante
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
in
contrast
the
purpos
of
mathemat
cryptolog
is
to
precis
formul
and
if
possibl
prove
the
statement
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
we
say
for
exampl
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secur
against
all
passiv
attack
if
ani
nontrivi
attack
against
the
system
a
defin
abov
is
too
slow
to
be
practic
if
we
can
prove
thi
statement
then
we
have
confid
that
our
cryptosystem
will
resist
ani
passiv
cryptanalyt
techniqu
if
we
can
reduc
thi
statement
to
some
wellknown
unsolv
problem
then
we
still
have
confid
that
the
cryptosystem
isnt
easi
to
break
other
part
of
cryptolog
are
also
amen
to
mathemat
definit
again
the
point
is
to
explicitli
identifi
what
assumpt
were
make
and
prove
that
they
produc
the
desir
result
we
can
figur
out
what
it
mean
for
a
particular
cryptosystem
to
be
use
properli
it
just
mean
that
the
assumpt
are
valid
the
same
methodolog
is
use
for
cryptanalysi
too
the
cryptanalyst
can
take
advantag
of
incorrect
assumpt
often
he
can
tri
to
construct
a
proof
of
secur
for
a
system
see
where
the
proof
fail
and
use
these
failur
a
the
start
point
for
hi
analysi
whi
is
the
onetim
pad
secur
by
definit
the
onetim
pad
is
a
cryptosystem
where
the
plaintext
ciphertext
and
key
are
all
string
say
byte
string
of
some
length
m
and
ekp
is
just
the
sum
let
say
the
exclus
or
of
k
and
p
it
is
easi
to
prove
mathemat
that
there
are
no
nontrivi
singleciphertext
attack
on
the
onetim
pad
assum
a
uniform
distribut
of
key
note
that
we
dont
have
to
assum
a
uniform
distribut
of
plaintext
here
the
proof
let
a
be
an
attack
ie
an
algorithm
take
two
input
f
g
and
produc
one
output
h
with
some
probabl
p
that
h
hp
whenev
f
fp
and
g
gekp
ie
g
gk
p
then
becaus
the
distribut
of
k
is
uniform
and
independ
of
p
the
distribut
of
k
p
must
also
be
uniform
and
independ
of
p
but
also
the
distribut
of
c
is
uniform
and
independ
of
p
henc
there
is
probabl
exactli
p
that
h
hp
whenev
f
fp
and
g
gc
over
all
p
and
c
thu
a
fortiori
a
is
trivial
on
the
other
hand
the
onetim
pad
is
not
secur
if
a
key
k
is
use
for
more
than
one
plaintext
ie
there
are
nontrivi
multipleciphertext
attack
so
to
be
properli
use
a
key
k
must
be
thrown
away
after
one
encrypt
the
key
is
also
call
a
pad
thi
explain
the
name
onetim
pad
what
a
ciphertextonli
attack
in
the
notat
abov
a
ciphertextonli
attack
is
one
where
f
is
constant
given
onli
some
inform
gekpekpn
about
n
ciphertext
the
attack
ha
to
have
some
chanc
of
produc
some
inform
hppn
about
the
plaintext
the
attack
is
trivial
if
it
ha
just
a
good
a
chanc
of
produc
hppn
when
given
gccn
for
random
ccn
for
exampl
say
gc
c
and
say
hp
is
the
first
bit
of
p
we
can
easili
write
down
an
attackth
guess
attack
which
simpli
guess
that
hp
is
thi
attack
is
trivial
becaus
it
doesnt
use
the
ciphertext
it
ha
a
fiftyfifti
chanc
of
guess
correctli
no
matter
what
on
the
other
hand
there
is
an
attack
on
rsa
which
produc
one
bit
of
inform
about
p
with
success
use
c
if
it
is
fed
a
random
c
then
the
success
rate
drop
to
so
thi
is
a
nontrivi
attack
what
a
knownplaintext
attack
the
classic
knownplaintext
attack
ha
fpp
p
gcc
cc
and
hpp
depend
onli
on
p
in
other
word
given
two
ciphertext
c
and
c
and
one
decrypt
p
the
knownplaintext
attack
should
produc
inform
about
the
other
decrypt
p
note
that
knownplaintext
attack
are
often
defin
in
the
literatur
a
produc
inform
about
the
key
but
thi
is
pointless
the
cryptanalyst
gener
care
about
the
key
onli
insofar
a
it
let
him
decrypt

messag
what
a

attack
a
chosenplaintext
attack
is
the
first
of
an

on
a
cryptosystem
attack
where
the
cryptanalyst
feed

to
the
encryptor
these
attack
dont
fit
into
our
model
of
passiv
attack
explain
abov
anyway
a
chosenplaintext
attack
let
the
cryptanalyst
choos
a
plaintext
and
look
at
the
correspond
ciphertext
then
repeat
until
he
ha
figur
out
how
to

exampl
of
thi
