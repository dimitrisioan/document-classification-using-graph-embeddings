scott

write
i
am
do
a
dormitori
bibl
discus
with
my
christian
roommat
and
of
the
nonchristian
guy
on
my
floor
they
are
veri
close
to
accept
christ
so
we
have
start
to
discipl
them
treat
them
like
babi
believ
and
go
into
more
indepth
subject
than
the
parabl
etc
our
first
discus
wa
on
prayer
eventu
we
got
around
to
how
we
should
pray
in
jesu
name
then
an
excel
question
came
up
one
that
i
dont
have
a
real
answer
to
the
question
wa
if
we
need
to
pray
in
jesu
name
what
about
the
peopl
befor
jesu
they
pray
to
god
and
he
listen
then
in
spite
of
their
sin
whi
cant
it
be
the
same
way
now
ill
take
a
tri
at
thi
from
the
discus
i
have
been
in
and
from
how
i
have
interpret
the
bibl
i
feel
that
one
can
pray
either
way
but
rememb
thi
befor
jesu
the
peopl
talk
to
god
no
other
way
and
he
talk
back
audibl
and
dream
etc
today
we
have
the
bibl
to
know
god
will
and
we
have
hi
son
you
die
for
u
he
wa
given
a
our
savior
and
while
we
still
do
thing
accord
to
god
will
we
pray
through
hi
son
in
the
bibl
it
say
that
if
we
are
not
known
to
jesu
we
are
not
known
to
god
sorri
i
do
not
have
the
vers
with
me
so
if
we
are
to
be
grant
etern
life
we
must
present
ourselv
to
jesu
first
who
will
then
present
u
to
god
leonard
thi
space
intent
left
blank
