if
you
are
use
the
standard
formula
of
fulli
god
and
fulli
human
that
im
not
sure
whi
you
object
to
say
that
jesu
wa
human
i
think
the
usual
analysi
would
be
that
sin
is
not
part
of
the
basic
definit
of
human
it
a
consequ
of
the
fall
jesu
is
human
but
not
a
fallen
human
clh
i
differ
with
our
moder
on
thi
i
thought
the
whole
idea
of
god
come
down
to
earth
to
live
a
one
of
u
subject
to
sin
and
death
a
one
of
the
consecr
prayer
in
the
book
of
common
prayer
put
it
wa
that
jesu
wa
tempt
but
did
not
succumb
if
sin
is
not
part
of
the
basic
definit
of
human
then
jesu
fulli
human
nicea
would
not
be
subject
to
sin
but
then
the
resurrect
lose
some
of
it
mean
becaus
we
encount
our
human
most
power
when
we
sin
to
distinguish
between
human
and
fallen
human
make
jesu
le
like
one
of
u
at
the
time
we
need
him
most
these
issu
get
mighti
subtl
when
you
see
peopl
say
differ
thing
it
often
hard
to
tell
whether
they
realli
mean
serious
differ
thing
or
whether
they
are
use
differ
terminolog
i
dont
think
there
ani
question
that
there
is
a
problem
with
nestoriu
and
i
would
agre
that
the
say
christ
had
a
human
form
without
a
real
human
natur
or
will
is
heret
but
id
like
to
be
a
bit
wari
about
the
copt
armenian
etc
recent
discuss
suggest
that
their
monophysit
posit
may
not
be
a
far
from
orthodoxi
a
mani
had
thought
nestoriu
wa
an
extrem
repres
of
one
of
the
two
major
school
of
thought
more
moder
repres
were
regard
a
orthodox
eg
theodor
of
mopsuestia
my
impress
is
that
the
modern
monophysit
group
inherit
the
entir
tradit
not
just
nestoriu
version
and
that
some
of
them
may
have
a
suffici
balanc
posit
to
be
regard
a
orthodox
clh
first
the
monophysit
inherit
none
of
nestoriu
version
they
were
on
the
opposit
end
of
the
spectrum
from
him
second
the
histor
record
suggest
that
the
posit
attribut
to
nestoriu
were
not
a
extrem
a
hi
success
oppon
who
wrote
the
convent
histori
claim
mainli
nestoriu
oppos
the
term
theotoko
for
mari
argu
i
think
correctli
that
a
human
could
not
be
call
mother
of
god
i
mean
in
the
athanasian
creed
we
talk
about
the
son
uncreat
sure
even
arian
would
conced
that
jesu
exist
long
befor
mari
anyway
nestoriu
oppon
claim
that
by
say
mari
wa
not
theotoko
that
he
claim
that
she
onli
gave
birth
to
the
human
natur
of
jesu
which
would
requir
two
seper
and
distinct
natur
the
argument
fail
though
becaus
mari
simpli
gave
birth
to
jesu
who
preexist
her
either
divin
if
you
accept
nestorian
a
commonli
defin
or
both
natur
intertwin
a
la
chalcedon
second
i
am
not
sure
that
nestorian
is
not
a
better
altern
than
the
orthodox
view
after
all
i
find
it
hard
to
believ
that
preincarn
that
jesu
human
natur
wa
in
heaven
likewis
postascens
i
think
rather
that
god
came
to
earth
and
took
our
natur
upon
him
it
wa
a
seper
natur
capabl
of
be
tempt
a
in
gethseman
sinc
i
believ
the
divin
natur
could
never
be
tempt
but
in
it
moment
of
weak
the
divin
natur
prevail
comment
on
the
abov
warmli
appreci
jason
albert
there
may
be
differ
in
what
we
mean
by
subject
to
sin
the
origin
complaint
wa
from
someon
who
didnt
see
how
we
could
call
jesu
fulli
human
becaus
he
didnt
sin
i
complet
agre
that
jesu
wa
subject
to
temptat
i
simpli
object
to
the
idea
that
by
not
succumb
he
is
therebi
not
fulli
human
i
believ
that
you
do
not
have
to
sin
in
order
to
be
human
i
again
apolog
for
confus
nestorian
and
monophysit
i
agre
with
you
and
have
said
elsewher
that
there
reason
to
think
that
not
everyon
who
is
associ
with
heret
posit
wa
in
fact
heret
there
are
scholar
who
maintain
that
nestoriu
wa
not
nestorian
i
have
to
confess
that
the
first
time
i
read
some
of
the
correspond
between
nestoriu
and
hi
oppon
i
thought
he
got
the
better
of
them
howev
most
scholar
do
believ
that
the
work
that
eventu
led
to
chalcedon
wa
an
advanc
and
that
nestoriu
wa
at
the
veri
least
rash
and
dogmat
a
the
editor
of
the
christolog
controversi
refer
to
him
in
reject
all
approach
other
than
hi
own
a
regular
usenet
reader
know
narrow
can
be
just
a
much
an
impedi
a
be
wrong
furthermor
he
did
say
some
thing
that
i
think
are
problemat
he
respond
to
a
rather
mild
letter
from
cyril
with
a
flame
worthi
of
usenet
in
it
he
say
to
attribut
also
to
the
logo
in
the
name
of
the
incarn
the
characterist
of
the
flesh
that
ha
been
conjoin
with
him
is
my
brother
either
the
work
of
a
mind
which
truli
err
in
the
fashion
of
the
greek
or
that
of
a
mind
diseas
with
the
insan
heresi
of
ariu
and
apollinari
and
the
other
those
who
are
thu
carri
away
with
the
idea
of
thi
associ
are
bound
becaus
of
it
to
make
the
divin
logo
have
a
part
in
be
fed
with
milk
and
particip
to
some
degre
in
growh
and
stand
in
need
of
angel
assist
becaus
of
hi
fear
these
thing
are
taken
fals
when
they
are
put
off
on
the
deiti
and
they
becom
the
occas
of
just
condemn
for
u
who
perpetr
the
falsehood
it
all
well
and
good
to
maintain
a
proper
distinct
between
human
and
divin
but
the
whole
concept
of
incarn
is
base
on
exactli
the
idea
that
the
divin
logo
doe
in
fact
have
to
some
degre
a
part
in
be
born
grow
up
and
die
of
cours
it
must
be
understood
that
there
a
certain
indirect
in
the
logo
particip
in
these
thing
but
there
must
be
some
sort
of
identif
between
the
divin
and
human
or
we
dont
have
an
incarn
at
all
nestoriu
seem
to
think
in
black
and
white
term
and
miss
the
sort
of
nuanc
one
need
to
deal
with
thi
area
you
say
i
find
it
hard
to
believ
that
preincarn
that
jesu
human
natur
wa
in
heaven
i
dont
think
that
requir
by
orthodox
doctrin
it
the
divin
logo
that
is
etern
