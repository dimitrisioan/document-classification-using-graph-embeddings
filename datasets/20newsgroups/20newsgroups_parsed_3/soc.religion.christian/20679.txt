get
some
sort
of
reason
interpret
we
are
now
on
chapter
and
which
talk
about
the
woman
on
the
beast
and
the
fall
of
babylon
i
believ
the
beast
is
the
antichrist
some
may
differ
but
it
seem
obviou
and
the
woman
repres
babylon
which
stand
for
rome
or
the
roman
cathol
church
what
are
some
view
on
thi
interpret
is
the
fall

the
same
babylon
in

a
the

wa
certainli
common
in
earlier
protest
writer
a
lot
of
u
find
that
frankli
embarass
now
though
some
of
our
reader
will
certainli
advoc
such
a
posit
the
problem
is
that
the
descript
make
it
look
a
lot
like
a
polit
entiti
it
associ
with

commerc
is

mountain
recal
that
rome
is
tradit
regard
a
built
on
seven
hill
if
it
a
church
then
it
not
the
current
roman
cathol
church
but
a
church
that
ha
been
taken
over
by
the
antichrist
and
merg
with
the
state
turn
into
someth
rather
differ
than
it
is
now
presum
in
such
a
scenario
the
true
cathol
are
among
those
who
are
persecut
given
the
overal
impress
that
satan
is
pretend
to
be
an
angel
of
light
and
the
true
church
is
a
persecut
remnant
i
think
the
most
consist
play
out
of
the
imag
would
be
that
the
antichrist
would
be
presid
over
a
church
that
claim
to
be
the
heir
of
both
the
protest
and
cathol
tradit
but
that
the
true
spiritu
descend
of
both
peter
and
the
reform
are
equal
