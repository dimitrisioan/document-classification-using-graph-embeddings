but
love
the
sinner

a
bit
recent
often
in
the
context
of

about
christian
and
homosexu
but
the
context
realli

my
question
is
whether

hate
beget
more
hate

unnam
sinc
i
dont
want
thi
to
digress
into
an
argument
a
to
whether
or
not
someth
is
a
sin
now
let
appli
our
hate
the
sin
philosophi
and
see
what
happen
if
we
truli
hate
the
sin
then
the
more
we
see
it
the
stronger
our
hatr
of
it
will
becom
eventu
thi
hate
becom
so
strong
that
we
becom
disgust
with
the
sinner
and
eventu
come
to
hate
the
sinner
in
addit
our
hatr
of
the
sin
often
caus
u
to
say
and
that
is
an
assumpt
on
your
part
where
is
your
proof
that
one
alway
will
degener
into
hate
the
sinner
becaus
he
hate
the
sin
i
am
remind
of
the
civil
right
movement
in
america
it
is
true
that
mani
individu
hate
the
propon
of
racism
it
is
also
true
that
mani
individu
hate
segreg
and
discrimin
with
their
whole
heart
and
never
degener
into
hate
the
individu
who
practic
it
dr
king
messag
wa
thi
love
the
individu
the
love
of
the
individu
would
transform
him
into
a
friend
howev
thi
did
not
take
away
hi
hatr
for
segreg
hi
hatr
for
injustic
in
the
summari
of
the
law
christ
command
u
to
love

he
doesnt
say
anyth
about

suppos
that

onli
one
way
to
deal
with
sin
either
in
other

ourselvesthrough
prayer
we
need
to
ask
god
to
help
u
with
our
own
sin
and
to
help
those
we
love
with
their
onli
love
can
conquer
sinhatr
ha
no
place
the
best
way
to
love
someon
is
to
pray
for
them
i
would
ask
did
john
the
baptist
practic
love
when
he
critic
the
jewish
leader
of
hi
day
did
jesu
practic
love
when
he
threw
the
moneychang
out
of
the
templ
we
must
have
at
least
a
distas
for
sin
we
must
in
order
to
fight
it
in
ourselv
also
we
must
be
readi
for
the
call
from
god
to
call
sin
by
it
right
name
jesu
love
everyon
but
he
call
sin
by
it
right
name
it
is
true
that
love
for
other
is
to
guid
everi
step
of
