can

that
you
were
right

the
doctrin
about

for
the
lord

not

i
dont
know
offhand
when
hi
elect
a
bishop
of

wa
but
im
quit
sure
it
wa
after
the
belief
in
mari
perpetu
virgin
origin
long
befor
augustin
time
we
hold
that
it
origin
with
the
apostl
strictli
speak
howev
mari
perpetu
virgin
is
independ
of
her
immacul
concept
mari
could
have
been
immacul
conceiv
and
not
remain
a
virgin
she
could
have
remain
a
virgin
and
not
been
immacul
conceiv
sinc
we
also
had
thi
notion
of
origin
sin
ie
that
man
is
born
with
a
predisposit
to
sin
and
sinc
mari
did
not
have
thi
predisposit
becaus
she
did
not
ever
sin
she
didnt
have
origin
sin
when
scienc
discov
the
process
of
concept
the
next
step
wa
to
assum
that
mari
wa
conceiv
without
origin
sin
the
immacul
concept
no
it
ha
been
held
in
the
church
sinc
ancient
time
that
origin
sin
wa
transmit
at
concept
when
a
person
life
begin
biolog
had
noth
to
do
with
it
prayer
reflect
on
the
truth
of
mari
sinless
and
the
mean
by
which
god
could
have
achiev
thi
the
church
arriv
at
the
truth
of
the
immacul
concept
thu
the
immacul
concept
is
not
a
new
doctrin
but
the
logic
result
of
our
understand
of
two
old
one
the
celebr
of
the
feast
of
the
immacul
concept
itself
wa
given
by
pope
sixtu
iv
and
the
feast
wa
made
a
precept
feast
of
the
church
by
pope
clement
xi
mari
at
that
time
appear
to
a
girl
name
bernadett
at
lourd
she
refer
to
herself
a
the
immacul
concept
sinc
a
nine
year
old
would
have
no
way
of
know
about
the
doctrin
the
apparit
wa
deem
to
be
true
and
it
seal
the
case
for
the
doctrin
no
first
of
all
lourd
is
privat
revel
and
doctrin
is
not
base
on
privat
revel
the
most
that
privat
revel
can
do
is
enhanc
and
deepen
our
understand
of
exist
public
revel
which
end
with
the
death
of
st
john
the
apostl
second
the
case
for
the
doctrin
wa
irreform
seal
in
with
the
ex
cathedra
promulg
of
the
bull
ineffabili
deu
by
pope
piu
ix
thi
meant
that
the
doctrin
wa
formal
recogn
a
a

a
dogma
by

can
not
chang
and
is
requir
to
be
believ
by
the
faith
the
apparit
at
lourd
happen
in
four
year
later
the
most
that
might
be
claim
is
that
lourd
gave
the
infal
proclam
of
a
sort
of
heavenli
stamp
of

the

ha
never
claim
