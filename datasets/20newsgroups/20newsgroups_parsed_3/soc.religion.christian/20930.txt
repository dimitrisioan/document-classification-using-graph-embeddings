re
a
question
that
ha
bee
bother
me
malcusco
write
my
problem
with
scienc
is
that
often
it
allow
u
to
assum
we
know
what
is
best
for
ourselv
god
endow
u
with
the
abil
to
produc
life
through
sexual
relat
for
exampl
but
he
did
not
make
that
avail
to
everyon
doe
that
mean
that
if
scienc
can
overrid
god
decis
through
alter
that
god
will
for
u
to
have
the
power
to
decid
who
should
and
should
not
be
abl
to
have
child
should
men
be
allow
to
have
babi
if
that
is
made
possibl
in
a
word
ye
i
dont
believ
that
physic
knowledg
ha
a
great
deal
of
impact
on
the
power
of
god
in
the
past
god
gave
u
the
abil
to
creat
life
through
sexual
relat
now
he
is
give
u
the
abil
to
creat
life
through
in
vitro
fertil
the
differ
between
the
two
is
mere
cosmet
and
even
if
we
gain
the
abil
to
creat
univers
we
wont
begin
to
approach
the
glori
of
god
the
power
we
are
be
given
is
a
test
and
i
am
sure
that
in
mani
case
we
will
use
our
new
abil
unwis
but
peopl
have
been
use
sexual
unwis
for
millenia
and
i
havent
heard
an
outcri
to
abolish
it
yet
no
matter
how
far
we
extend
our
dominion
over
the
physic
world
we
arent
imping
on
god
power
it
onli
when
we
attempt
to
gain
control
of
the
spiritu
world
those
thing
that
cant
be
approach
through
scienc
and
logic
that
we
begin
to
interfer
with
god
alan
terlep
and
the
scorpion
say
it
