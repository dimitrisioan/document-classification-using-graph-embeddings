i
mean
simpli
that
you
believ
that
god
doe
not
exist
christian
can
also
feel
that
sens
of
differ
howev
when
they
are
associ
with
those
weird
televangelist
who
alway
talk
about
satan
if
youll
excus
the
clich
sound
of
thi
everyon
ha
to
deal
with
hi
her
differ
from
other
peopl
i
can
understand
how
be
an
atheist
could
be
hard
for
you
be
a
christian
is
sometim
hard
for
me
i
becam
an
atheist
when
i
got
old
enough
to
reason
becaus
there
wa
just
no
good
reason
to

veri
pain
becaus

not
have
to
repress
how
you
feel
you
should
be
abl
to
discu
it
without
fear
i
think
there
are
admir
thing
to
learn
from
ani
belief
which
can
enrich
your
own
by
ask
myself
the
question
that
atheist
may
ask
me
i
can
learn
the
answer
and
becom
stronger
in
my
faith
if
my
faith
cant
support
know
the
answer
to
those
question
it
is
weak
and
untru
i
have
sympathi
for

up
in

environ
and
have
to
hide
and
sometim
at
