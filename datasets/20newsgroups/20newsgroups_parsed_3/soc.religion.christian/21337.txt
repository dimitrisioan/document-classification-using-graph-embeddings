montgomeri
write
i
believ
that
the
god
ha
preserv
the
bibl
perfectli
in
that
it
perfectli
convey
all
of
the
truth
that
he
intend
thi
he
ha
done
oh
yea
which
version
of
the
bibl
is
the
perfectli
preserv
one
and
whi
are
there
so
mani
translat
that
are
not
perfectli
preserv
is
god
tri
to
confus
u
minor
chang
in
word
or
even
accident
omiss
of
passag
in
some
manuscript
doe
not
chang
the
truth
be
convey
nor
would
it
lead
a
seriou
student
into
doctrin
error
note
also
that
god
provid
mani
but
that
is
exactli
what
happend
there
are
so
mani
branch
of
denomin
of
christian
and
deviat
of
doctrin
portrud
from
vari
translat
of
biblic
text
by
seriou
student
that
are
much
too
numer
to
begin
to
count
if
there
is
a
perfect
bibl
then
there
would
be
no
possibl
misinterpret
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
anyon
here
to
be
debat
it
on
the
other
hand
mayb
the
bibl
is
perfect
but
no
one
on
thi
planet
is
perfect
enough
to
read
it
correctli
but
then
there
would
be
no
point
in
god
give
u
someth
we
can
not
use
correctli
in
short
if
you
attack
the
credibl
and
reliabl
of
the
bibl
you
are
on
weak
ground
furthermor
the
onli
reason
that
i
can
see
for
want
to
do
so
is
to
remov
the
bibl
a
the
final
author
and
instead
put
that
respons
on
men
to
sift
the
bibl
to
strain
out
the
nugget
of
truth
that
it
contain
in
other
word
what
they
want
to
believ
and
ignor
the
rest
the
bibl
is
truth
it
doe
not
just
contain
truth
imho
if
you
trust
your
salvat
on
the
reliabl
of
a
singl
book
you
are
on
weak
ground
rememb
in
the
