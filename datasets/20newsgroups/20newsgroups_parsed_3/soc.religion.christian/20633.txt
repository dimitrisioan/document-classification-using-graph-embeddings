enter
thi
discuss
rather
late
but
i
do
have
one
question
wasnt
it
a
reagan
appointe
jame
watt
a
pentacost
christian
i
think
who
wa
the
secretari
of
the
interior
who
saw
no
problem
with
deforest
sinc
we
were
live
in
the
last
day
and
our
would
be
the
last
gener
to
see
the
redwood
anyway
i
heard
the
same
thing
but
without
confirm
that
he
actual
said
it
it
wa
just
a
alarm
to
u
a
to
you
the
bibl
say
that
nobodi
know
when
the
second
come
will
take
place
michael
a
covington
i
do
recal
watt
make
a
comment
to
thi
effect
though
it
wa
quit
a
few
year
back
and
i
cant
cite
the
specif
i
also
recal
that
cecil
andru
who
wa
secretari
of
the
interior
dure
the

administr
respond
to
watt
comment
by
point
out
the
stewardship
role
that
god
gave
to
man
a
record
in
genesi
which
make
me
wonder
who
are
the
true
conserv
it
seem
to
me
that
a
conserv
should
want
to
conserv
thing
of
valu
for
longterm
societ
benefit
thi
form
of
conserv
should
logic
extend
to
the
physic
environ
in
which
peopl
live
a
well
a
the
moral
environ
in
which
they
relat
to
one
anoth
and
to
god
imho
watt
stewardship
statu
is
not
enhanc
by
the
fact
that
he
