write
the
bibl
messag
is
that
we
are
to
love
all
peopl
and
that
all
peopl
are
redeem
it
preach
a
messag
of
repent
and
of
give
unfortun
all
peopl
have
deceit
heart
and
are
capabl
of
turn
thi
messag
around
and
contort
it
in
sometim
unbeliev
way
thi
is
also
a
fundament
christian
doctrin
andrew
how
i
wish
thi
were
true
and
how
i
long
for
the
day
in
which
it
will
be
true
but
ala
it
is
not
true
of
histori
the
bibl
doe
not
have
a
messag
it
ha
messag
and
some
of
those
are
messag
of
repent
and
give
to
turn
the
other
cheek
and
do
unto
the
least
of
these
but
some
of
the
messag
are
the
complet
opposit
like
the
isrealit
order
to
wipe
out
other
tribe
includ
woman
and
child
down
to
cattl
and
punish
sever
when
they
were
le
than
complet
about
the
job
like
jew
who
are
said
to
have
cri
out
in
matthew
hi
blood
be
upon
our
head
and
our
child
head
a
vers
quot
in
everi
pogrom
from
the
crusad
to
the
holocaust
have
these
been
misunderstood
i
think
not
they
have
onli
been
understood
too
clearli
it
is
essenti
that
christian
grasp
firmli
the
good
the
bibl
teach
the
meek
carpent
from
nazareth
is
a
potent
symbol
for
how
we
should
be
hi
teach
we
must
take
to
heart
but
we
can
not
ignor
the
other
materi
in
the
bibl
which
is
not
to
our
like
and
say
those
who
live
by
that
have
misread
it
to
say
that
is
onli
to
chose
a
point
of
interpret
and
declar
it
norm
such
can
be
done
with
the
same
legitmaci
by
anyon
instead
we
must
let
the
text
critiqu
the
text
understand
that
there
is
both
good
and
bad
in
our
sacr
corpu
we
test
all
thing
and
hold
fast
to
that
which
is
good
p
i
believ
that
a
line
of
question
like
you
present
is
strang
enough
compat
with
becom
a
christian
certainli
christian
encourag
one
to
question
the
behaviour
of
the
world
and
especi
christian
i
prais
god
for
jesu
christ
and
the
fact
that
we
can
doubt
our
belief
and
still
come
back
to
god
and
be
forgiven
time
and
time
again
at
the
risk
of
sound
heret
well
ok
more
heret
i
dont
think
that
doubt
is
someth
which
requir
forgiv
it
is
someth
which
requir
introspect
and
reflect
if
that
is
a
sin
then
there
can
be
no
salvat
for
doubt
is
an
inescapbl
part
of
be
human
consid
job
hi
friend
had
no
doubt
wherea
job
had
no
doubt
in
himself
but
doubt
the
wisdom
and
justic
of
god
when
god
final
did
appear
he
rebuk
the
friend
and
had
job
make
sacrific
for
them
to
be
a

it
to
alway
have
