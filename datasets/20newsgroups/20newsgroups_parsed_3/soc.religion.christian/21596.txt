seem
to
impli
some
pretti
seriou
sin
the
one
of
the
pastor
in
the
church
i
attend
christchurch
citi
elim
consid
that
a
prophesi
of
a
natur
disast
a
a
judgement
from
the
lord
is
a
clear
sign
that
the
prophesi
is
not
from
the
lord
i
would
like
to
see
hi
reason
behind
thi
you
may
have
gotten
if
i
get
a
chanc
i
will
ask
them
thi
weekend
burn
by
natur
disast
propheci
down
there
but
that
doe
not
mean
that
everi
natur
disasterjudg
propheci
is
fals
take
a
quick
look
at
the
book
of
jeremiah
and
it
is
obviou
that
judgement
propheci
can
be
valid
here
in
the
u
it
seem
like
we
might
have
more
of
a
problem
with
posit
propheci
though
i
am
sure
there
may
be
a
few
peopl
who
are
too
into
judgement
the
word
i
have
underlin
are
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
a
quick
look
doesnt
do
justic
to
the
depth
of
the
book
of
jeremiah
have
studi
the
jeremiahezeki
period
solidli
for
over
a
year
at
one
stage
of
my
life
i
have
to
say
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
underli
theolog
mean
in
the
judgement
prophesi
let
me
make
one
point
the
clash
between
jeremiah
and
the
fals
prophet
wa
primarili
in
the
theolog
realm
the
fals
prophet
understood
their
relatioship
to
god
to
be
base
on
the
coven
that
the
lord
made
with
david
it
is
possibl
to
trace
within
the
page
of
the
old
testament
who
thi
coven
which
wa
initi
condit
on
the
continu
obedi
of
david
descend
came
to
be
view
a
an
uncondit
promis
on
the
part
of
the
lord
to
keep
a
descend
of
david
upon
the
throne
and
to
never
allow
jerusalem
to
subjeg
by
ani
foreign
power
jeremiah
wa
not
a
judahit
prophet
he
wa
from
anathoth
across
the
border
in
what
had
formerli
been
israelit
territori
when
he
came
to
prophesi
he
came
from
the
theolog
background
of
the
coven
the
lord
had
made
with
israel
through
mose
the
northern
kingdom
had
reject
the
david
coven
after
the
death
of
solomon
hi
theolog
clash
with
the
theolog
of
the
local
prophet
it
wa
out
of
a
veri
deep
understand
of
the
mosaic
coven
and
an
actut
awar
of
intern
event
that
jeremiah
spoke
hi
prophesi
the
judgement
prophesi
were
deepli
load
with
theolog
mean
in
my
opinion
both
the
portland
earthquak
prophesi
and
the
david
wilkerson
new
york
will
burn
prophesi
are
froth
and
bubbl
compar
to
the
majest
theolog
depth
of
the
jeremiah
