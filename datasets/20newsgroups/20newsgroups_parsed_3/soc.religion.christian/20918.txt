the

produc
the
result
that

i
assum
that
it

the
differ
is
not
in
contracept
technolog
but
in
the
valu
taught
to
the
child
the
ppsiecu
curriculum
taught
the
kid
that
they
have
legitim
choic
while
the
abstin
relat
curriculum
taught
them
that
they
did
not
have
legitim
choic
other
than
abstin
it
is
the
valu
system
that
is
the
strongest
determin
of
the
behavior

they
are
suppress
in

that
produc
an

discus
a
they
say
in

abstin
isnt
it
becaus
we
know
that
a
class
in
how
to
use
drug
safe
if
you
choos
to
use
drug
would
increas
drug
use
whi
isnt

abstin
educ
bar
from

becaus
it
teach

arent
we
abandon
those
