re
some
question
from
a
new
christian
ofm
respond
to
a
queri
about
refer
work
asid
from
a
commentari
you
might
also
want
to
consid
an
introduct
these
are
book
intend
for
use
in
undergradu
bibl
cours
they
give
histor
background
discus
of
literari
style
etc
and
gener
they
have
good
bibligraphi
for
further
read
i
typic
recommend
kee
froehlich
and
young
nt
introduct
two
other
intro
to
consid
the
introduct
by
kummel
is
a
translat
of
a
strandard
nt
text
the
refer
are
slightli
date
and
the
style
is
somewhat
den
but
the
book
contain
a
wealth
of
inform
perrin
and
dule
intro
is
also
veri
good
it
somewhat
more
modern
than
kummel
but
not
quit
so
den
pack
also
the
author
tend
to
go
through
the
book
of
the
nt
in
the
histor
order
of
composit
thi
give
a
veri
use
perspect
on
the
develop
of
the
nt
there
are
also
some
good
onevolum
commentari
probabl
the
best
recommend
these
day
would
be
harper
bibl
commentari
a
slight
dissent
i
think
the
harper
is
ok
but
not
great
one
particular
problem
i
have
is
that
it
tend
to
be
pretti
skimpi
on
bibliograph
materi
my
feel
is
that
it
is
ok
for
quick
lookup
but
not
real
use
for
studi
in
depth
eg
i
keep
a
copi
in
my
offic
at
work
i
think
there
may
be
a
coupl
of
book
with
thi
titl
so
far
a
i
know
there
is
the
onli
one
book
with
thi
exact
titl
jame
l
may
gener
editor
harper
and
row
although
i
think
i
recal
a
older
seri
under
the
name
harper
commentari
also
there
a
separ
harper
bibl
dictionari
most
of
my
comment
on
the
hc
also
appli
to
the
hbd
my
favorit
onevolum
commentari
is
the
new
jerom
biblic
commentari
the
njbc
is
rather
cathol
in
focu
and
somewhat
bias
toward
the
nt
the
reader
can
decid
for
her
or
himself
whether
these
are
pluse
or
minus
in
ani
case
the
scholarship
is
by
and
larg
excel
note
the
njbc
is
a
complet
rework
updat
version
of
the
jerom
biblic
commentari
copi
of
which
can
still
be
found
on
sale
