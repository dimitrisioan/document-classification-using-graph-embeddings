meet
some
gay
christian
find
out
who
they
are
pray
with

discu
scriptur
with
them
and
onli
then
form
your
opinion
if
you
were
to
start
your

thi
would
be
fine
but
there
is
no
scriptur

it
realli
get
to
the
heart
of
the
problem
you
think
you
know
more
than
scriptur
your
faith
is
driven
by
feel
goodism
and
not
by
the
word
of
god
just
becaus
they
are
nice
peopl
doesnt
make
it
right
you
can
start
all
the
church

and
it
wont
chang
the
fact
that
it
is
wrong
that
is
not
to
impli
that
gay
dont
deserv
the
same
love
and
forgiv
that
anyon
els
doe
but
to
call
their
behavior
right
just
becaus
they
are
nice
peopl
is
baseless
and
it
offer
satan
