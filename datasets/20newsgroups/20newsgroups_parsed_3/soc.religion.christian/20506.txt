subject
question
from
a
newbi
is
life
a
passfail
cours
and
doe
god
grade
on
a
curv
im
new
here
and
onli
vagu
religi
but
i
want
to
know
what
some
of
you
peopl
think
specif
are
there
an
infinit
number
of
heaven
and
a
person
go
to
the
one
that
hesh
deserv
or
is
it
simpli
heaven
or
noth
hell
also
are
we
grade
by
those
around
u
or
ha
there
alway
been
some
unchang
method
is
the
person
childhood
taken
into
account
im
sure
these
must
sound
like
oversimplif
to
most
of
you
but
i
figur
that
your
the
expert
quinn
eschatolog
is
an
area
on
which
christian
do
not
agre
i
suspect
that
becaus
our
primari
sourc
of
inform
is
prophet
and
visionari
and
their
write
tend
to
be
highli
symbol
howev
both
jesu
teach
in
the
gospel
and
book
such
a
the
revel
to
john
talk
primarili
about
the
differ
between
etern
life
and
etern
death
on
a
number
of
occas
jesu
doe
say
thing
that
impli
some
sort
of
differenti
eg
lk
and
a
number
of
similar
passag
where
jesu
say
thing
like
even
xxx
will
be
better
off
than
you
in
the
judgement
also
i
cor
talk
about
someon
who
get
into
heaven
but
by
the
skin
of
hi
teeth
a
it
were
but
these
passag
are
not
normal
interpret
a
suggest
separ
heaven
so
much
a
differ
level
of
prestig
or
punish
in
heaven
or
hell
and
not
all
christian
would
even
go
a
far
a
that
the
onli
christian
group
i
know
of
that
belief
in
multipl
heaven
is
the
mormon
and
they
are
veri
far
from
mainstream
christian
far
enough
that
mani
of
our
reader
would
not
call
them
christian
their
idea
in
thi
area
involv
specif
mormon
revel
in
addit
to
the
bibl
and
holi
tradit
of
a
more
gener
christian
sort
note
that
mani
christian
will
cring
at
the
veri
thought
of
associ
grade
with
god
the
whole
point
of
christ
wa
to
free
u
from
the
result
of
a
test
that
we
couldnt
possibl
pa
if
you
like
test
analog
god
grade
on
a
veri
strict
and
unbend
scale
but
he
also
cheat
he
replac
our
test
paper
with
an
exam
that
wa
prepar
by
the
teacher
befor
actual
do
the
grade
becaus
some
peopl
end
up
in
heaven
and
other
in
hell
it
easi
to
see
whi
youd
be
inclin
to
think
of
it
a
grade
while
there
are
differ
among
branch
of
christian
on
detail
i
think
we
all
agre
that
in
one
way
or
anoth
god
cheat
i
am
person
veri
sceptic
about
anyon
who
claim
to
know
exactli
how
far
god
cheat
extend
will
he
accept
peopl
who
dont
explicitli
acknowledg
christ
but
somehow
still
follow
him
in
their
heart
mani
christian
believ
that
thi
is
possibl
at
least
in
principl
but
certainli
not
all
do
jesu
provid
u
with
a
clear
descript
of
how
to
be
save
but
it
not
clear
to
me
that
he
provid
an
exact
descript
of
how
he
go
to
place
the
divid
line
certainli
he
made
it
clear
that
we
cant
expect
to
know
whether
other
individu
are
save
or
not
