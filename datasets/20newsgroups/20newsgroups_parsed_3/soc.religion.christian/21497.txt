subject
baptism
requir
faith
it
troubl
me
that
there
have
been
so
mani
post
recent
tri
to
support
the
doctrin
of
origin
sin
thi
is
primarili
a
cathol
doctrin
with
no
other
purpos
than
to
defend
the
idea
of
infant
baptism
even
among
it
support
howev
peopl
will
stop
short
of
say
that
unbaptis
infant
will
go
to
hell
it
veri
easi
for
just
about
anyon
to
come
up
with
a
partial
list
of
scriptur
to
support
ani
sort
of
wrong
doctrin
howev
if
we
have
the
heart
to
persever
in
our
belief
to
make
sure
that
they
are
biblic
base
then
we
can
come
to
an
understand
of
the
truth
let
now
take
a
more
complet
look
at
scriptur
colossian
in
him
you
were
also
circumcis
in
the
put
off
of
the
sin
natur
not
with
a
circumcis
done
by
christ
have
been
buri
with
him
in
baptism
and
rais
with
him
through
your
faith
in
the
power
of
god
who
rais
him
from
the
dead
in
baptism
we
are
rais
to
a
new
life
in
christ
roman
through
a
person
faith
in
the
power
of
god
our
parent
faith
can
not
do
thi
do
infant
have
faith
let
look
at
what
the
bibl
ha
to
say
about
it
roman
but
not
all
the
israelit
accept
the
good
news
for
isaiah
say
lord
who
ha
believ
our
messag
consequ
faith
come
from
hear
the
messag
and
the
messag
is
heard
through
the
word
of
christ
so
then
we
receiv
god
gift
of
faith
to
u
a
we
hear
the
messag
of
the
gospel
faith
is
a
possibl
respons
to
hear
god
word
preach
kid
are
not
yet
spiritu
intellectu
or
emot
matur
enough
to
respond
to
god
word
henc
they
can
not
have
faith
and
therefor
can
not
be
rais
in
baptism
to
a
new
life
ezekiel
the
soul
who
sin
will
die
the
son
will
not
share
the
guilt
of
the
father
nor
will
the
father
share
the
guilt
of
the
son
the
righteous
of
the
righteou
man
will
be
credit
to
him
and
the
wicked
of
the
wick
will
be
charg
against
him
if
you
read
all
of
ezekiel
you
will
see
that
god
doesnt
hold
u
guilti
for
anyon
el
sin
so
we
can
have
no
origin
guilt
from
adam
ezekiel
rid
yourselv
of
all
the
offens
you
have
committ
and
get
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit
whi
will
you
die
o
hous
of
israel
for
i
take
no
pleasur
in
the
death
of
anyon
declar
the
sovereign
lord
repent
and
live
the
way
to
pleas
god
is
to
repent
and
get
a
new
heart
and
spirit
kid
can
not
do
thi
act
say
that
when
we
repent
and
are
baptiz
we
will
then
receiv
a
new
spirit
the
holi
spirit
then
we
shall
live
now
then
that
we
have
a
littl
more
background
a
to
whi
origin
sin
is
not
biblic
let
look
at
some
of
the
scriptur
use
to
support
it
roman
therefor
just
a
sin
enter
the
world
through
one
man
and
death
through
sin
and
in
thi
way
death
came
to
all
men
becaus
all
sin
sin
and
death
enter
the
world
when
the
first
man
sin
death
came
to
each
man
becaus
each
man
sin
note
that
it
good
to
read
through
all
of
roman
some
of
the
vers
are
easier
to
misunderstand
than
other
but
if
we
read
them
in
context
we
will
see
that
they
are
all
say
basic
the
same
thing
let
look
at
one
such
roman
for
just
a
through
the
disobedi
of
the
one
man
the
mani
were
made
sinner
so
also
through
the
obedi
of
the
one
man
the
mani
will
be
made
righteou
through
the
disobedi
of
each
individu
each
wa
made
a
sinner
in
the
same
way
through
the
obedi
of
jesu
each
will
be
made
righteou
we
must
rememb
when
read
through
thi
passag
that
death
came
to
each
man
onli
becaus
each
man
sin
not
becaus
of
guilt
from
adam
otherwis
the
bibl
would
contradict
itself
i
encourag
you
to
read
through
thi
whole
passag
on
your
own
look
at
it
from
thi
point
of
view
to
see
if
it
doesnt
all
fit
togeth
psalm
sure
i
wa
sin
at
birth
sin
from
the
time
my
mother
conceiv
me
thi
whole
psalm
is
a
wonder
exampl
of
how
we
should
humbl
ourselv
befor
god
in
repent
for
sin
david
himself
wa
a
man
after
god
own
heart
and
wrote
the
psalm
after
commit
adultri
with
bathsheba
and
murder
her
husband
all
that
david
is
say
here
is
that
he
cant
rememb
a
time
when
he
wasnt
sin
he
is
humbl
himself
befor
god
by
confess
hi
sin
hi
say
that
he
wa
sin
at
birth
is
a
hyperbol
the
bibl
be
inspir
by
god
isnt
limit
to
a
liter
interpet
but
also
us
figur
of
speech
a
did
jesu
john
for
anoth
exampl
of
hyperbol
see
luke
now
then
even
though
peopl
see
that
baptism
requir
faith
and
that
origin
sin
is
not
biblic
they
will
still
argu
that
infant
baptism
is
necessari
becaus
child
sin
by
be
selfish
not
share
toy
with
other
child
by
be
mean
hit
other
and
fight
etc
certainli
we
have
observ
child
do
wrong
thing
but
my
gut
feel
is
alway
that
they
dont
know
ani
better
let
look
to
see
if
the
bibl
agre
with
my
gut
feel
isaiah
therefor
the
lord
himself
will
give
you
a
sign
the
virgin
will
be
with
child
and
will
give
birth
to
a
son
and
will
call
him
immanuel
he
will
eat
curd
and
honey
when
he
know
enough
to
reject
the
wrong
and
choos
the
right
now
just
about
ani
church
leader
will
tell
you
that
thi
is
a
propheci
about
jesu
if
they
dont
then
point
them
to
matthew
and
find
a
new
leader
jesu
certainli
couldnt
have
had
le
knowledg
than
normal
human
babi
yet
thi
passag
say
that
he
had
to
matur
to
a
certain
extent
befor
he
would
know
the
differ
between
right
and
wrong
we
see
that
he
did
grow
and
becom
wiser
in
luke
and
the
implic
is
that
jesu
did
wrong
thing
a
a
child
befor
he
knew
to
choos
right
over
wrong
sinc
we
know
that
jesu
wa
perfect
without
sin
we
have
rather
conclus
proof
that
babi
can
not
sin
becaus
they
dont
know
to
choos
the
right
instead
of
the
wrong
jesu
himself
wa
baptiz
albeit
with
john
baptism
not
a
an
infant
but
a
a
thirtyyearold
man
luke
and
start
