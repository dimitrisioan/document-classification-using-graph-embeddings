re
certainti
and
arrog
darren
dr
nanci
sweeti
write
darren
in
an
earlier
articl
i
explain
that
what
mani
peopl
find
darren
arrog
about
christian
is
that
some
christian
profess
darren
absolut
certainti
about
their
belief
and
doctrin
and
darren
in
short
the
problem
is
that
no
matter
how
good
your
sourc
darren
are
if
ani
part
of
your
doctrin
or
belief
rest
on
your
own
darren
think
and
reason
then
those
doctrin
are
suspect
the
point
that
darren
rais
is
a
veri
lutheran
viewpoint
while
reason
is
a
gift
from
god
it
is
also
infect
by
sin
yet
we
do
not
reject
reason
entirelyand
neither
i
think
doe
darren
we
need
reason
a
darren
himself
ha
point
out
to
comprehend
god
revel
of
himself
in
the
bibl
but
reason
alon
is
not
suffici
to
comprehend
and
believ
the
word
we
need
first
and
foremost
faith
for
the
sin
mind
is
hostil
to
god
it
doe
not
submit
to
god
law
nor
can
it
do
so
roman
luther
accept
scriptur
a
the
sole
mean
of
revel
sola
scriptura
but
accept
the
necess
of
the
use
of
reason
with
faith
in
comprehend
that
revel
yet
luther
also
said
regard
baptism
but
mad
reason
rush
forth
and
becaus
baptism
is
not
dazzl
like
the
work
which
we
do
regard
it
a
worthless
larg
catech
fourth
part
baptism
to
make
matter
more
complic
luther
wa
the
sort
of
theologian
that
mani
peopl
would
describ
a
an
absolutist
ive
seen
him
describ
a
a
take
no
prison
theologian
we
might
conclud
given
these
observ
that
luther
wa
inconsist
or
mad
and
sure
at
least
some
have
come
to
that
conclus
but
it
might
be
use
to
recal
that
jesu
wa
also
call
mad
and
peter
felt
compel
to
defend
himself
and
the
apostl
against
a
charg
of
drunken
on
pentecost
so
we
a
christian
ought
to
be
care
about
reject
luther
or
other
a
mad
rather
we
should
imit
the
berean
who
examin
the
scriptur
everi
day
to
see
if
what
paul
said
wa
true
act
the
basi
for
the
confid
with
which
luther
peter
paul
and
mani
other
preach
the
gospel
wa
not
just
reason
but
faith
and
the
holi
spirit
thi
is
not
faith
divorc
from
reason
but
a
faith
that
guid
inform
and
us
reason
the
spirit
enabl
u
to
know
the
truth
and
to
proclaim
it
boldli
god
doe
not
want
u
to
preach
the
messag
that
i
think
that
jesu
might
have
risen
from
the
dead
but
rather
i
know
that
my
redeem
life
job
the
christian
doe
not
side
with
pilat
in
say
what
is
truth
but
rather
follow
christ
who
said
in
fact
for
thi
reason
i
wa
born
and
for
thi
i
came
into
the
world
to
testifi
to
the
truth
everyon
on
the
side
of
truth
listen
to
me
john
we
can
know
the
truth
becaus
god
ha
promis
u
that
we
can
know
the
truth
jesu
said
if
you
hold
to
my
teach
you
are
realli
my
discipl
then
you
will
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
will
set
you
free
john
the
proverb
urg
u
buy
the
truth
and
do
not
sell
it
pr
the
psalmist
pray
do
not
snatch
to
word
of
truth
from
my
mouth
p
evid
he
believ
that
the
word
of
truth
wa
in
fact
in
hi
mouth
yet
we
do
inde
appear
arrog
if
our
claim
to
the
truth
is
motiv
by
selfglorif
but
if
we
present
the
truth
a
the
teach
of
scriptur
reveal
by
the
spirit
and
not
our
own
invent
and
if
we
stand
readi
to
be
prove
wrong
on
the
basi
of
scriptur
a
luther
did
then
we
are
not
arrog
but
humbl
we
should
humbl
trust
in
god
promis
of
truth
just
a
we
trust
in
hi
promis
of
forgiv
rexlex
it
is
onli
becaus
of
god
own
revel
that
we
can
be
rexlex
absolut
about
a
thing
darren
but
how
far
doe
that
get
you
onc
god
revel
stop
darren
and
your
own
reason
begin
possibl
for
error
appear
i
agre
that
we
must
make
a
distinct
between
the
clear
teach
of
scriptur
and
the
product
of
our
own
reasoneven
when
such
reason
is
base
on
scriptur
howev
i
think
i
would
draw
the
line
of
distinct
more
reason
and
le
academ
than
you
would
darren
for
exampl
let
suppos
that
our
modern
bibl
translat
darren
includ
a
perfect
render
of
jesu
word
at
the
last
supper
darren
and
that
jesu
said
exactli
thi
is
my
bodi
darren
well
presum
that
what
he
said
wa
total
without
error
and
darren
absolut
true
what
can
we
be
certain
of
not
much
darren
at
the
moment
he
stop
speak
and
peopl
start
darren
interpret
the
possibl
of
error
appear
did
he
mean
darren
that
liter
or
not
we
do
not
have
ani
record
that
he
darren
elabor
on
the
word
wa
he
think
of
tran
or
con
darren
substanti
he
didnt
say
darren
is
almost
at
the
point
of
make
a
veri
lutheran
statement
about
the
lord
supper
the
lutheran
approach
is
to
say
that
if
jesu
said
thi
is
my
bodi
then
that
is
what
we
should
believ
other
interpret
are
reject
simpli
becaus
they
are
not
taught
in
scriptur
recal
that
jesu
word
do
not
stand
alon
on
thi
subject
we
also
have
paul
word
in
corinthian
in
which
he
pass
on
to
u
what
he
receiv
from
the
lord
in
particular
he
said
for
whenev
you
eat
thi
bread
and
drink
thi
cup
you
proclaim
the
lord
death
until
he
come
by
these
word
we
should
believ
that
the
bread
that
we
eat
in
the
lord
supper
realli
is
bread
a
well
a
the
lord
bodya
our
sen
in
fact
tell
u
doe
thi
prove
that
transubstanti
is
fals
i
suppos
someon
could
say
that
paul
spoke
metaphor
of
the
lord
bodi
a
bread
simpli
becaus
that
is
the
way
the
bodi
appear
when
we
eat
it
but
thi
thought
is
found
nowher
in
scriptur
so
we
reject
it
thu
the
primari
reason
for
reject
transubstanti
is
not
that
we
can
prove
it
fals
but
that
it
is
simpli
not
found
in
scriptur
side
remark
ive
been
told
that
the
lutheran
doctrin
on
real
presenc
is
consubstanti
but
it
ha
been
nonlutheran
who
have
told
me
thi
we
tend
not
to
use
the
word
i
almost
think
that
thi
is
use
more
by
professor
of
compar
religion
who
need
label
to
compar
cathol
lutheran
and
reform
teach
on
the
lord
supper
but
almost
everi
church
want
to
call
their
own
teach
real
presenc
becaus
that
wa
the
tradit
teach
of
the
church
end
side
remark
darren
when
christian
speak
a
if
they
believ
their
own
reason
darren
can
never
lead
them
astray
when
we
implicitli
claim
that
we
darren
are
infal
the
non
christian
around
u
rare
believ
darren
that
implicit
claim
wit
is
hardli
go
to
work
when
darren
the
person
you
are
talk
to
belief
that
you
are
either
too
darren
foolish
to
recognis
your
own
limit
or
intent
tri
darren
to
cover
them
up
thi
is
precis
whi
christian
should
not
reli
on
ration
in
their
wit
it
is
far
better
to
take
the
approach
id
like
to
show
you
what
scriptur
say
you
decid
for
yourself
whether
to
believ
it
or
not
darren
rexlex
suggest
that
peopl
read
he
is
there
and
he
is
not
darren
silent
by
franci
schaeffer
i
didnt
think
veri
highli
of

but
i
think
that
mr
schaeffer
is
grossli
overr
by
mani
darren
evangel
christian
somebodi
els
might
like
it
though
darren
so
dont
let
my
opinion
stop
you
from
read
