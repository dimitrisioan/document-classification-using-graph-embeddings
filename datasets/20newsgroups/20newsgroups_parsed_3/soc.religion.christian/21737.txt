the

think
we

all
agre
with

be
name
by
fornic

theft
or
covet

or
drunken
which
would
well
deserv
condemn
we
may

may
not
agre
to
the
bound
of
those
categori
howev
and
the
veri
fact
that
they
are
argu
over
suggest
that
not
onli
is
the
matter
not
at

that

corinthian
nasb
there
are
plenti
of
law
prohibit
sexual
behavior
to
be
found
in
leviticu
most
of
which
christian
ignor
complet
they
never
even
bother
to
examin
them
they
just
assum
that
they
know
which
one
are
moral
and
which
one
are
ritual
well
i
have
news
for
you
ani
anthropolog
cours
should
sensit
you
to
ritual
and
clean
v
unlcean
a
categori
in
an
aw
lot
of
societi
we
have
them
too
but
buri
pretti
deep
and
i
can
not
see
ani
ground
for
distinguish
these
bit
of
leviticu
from
the
ritual
law
which
no
christian
i
know
feel
appli
to
u
i
disagre
everi
law
that
is
written
in
leviticu
should
be
look
at
a
sin
that
is
whi
we
have
a
need
for
a
savior
i
can
understand
someon
who
may
not
know
a
particular
sin
list
in
the
levitc
law
but
i
would
hope
that
they
would
repent
when
confront
with
it
i
notic
that
the
vers
forbid
bestial
immedi
follow
the
vers
prohibit
what
appear
to
be
homosexu
intercours
well
latida
so
what
thi
is
almost
a
slimey
an
argument
a
the
one
that
homosexu
rape
i
know
of
no
one
who
argu
serious
though
one
can
alway
find
joker
in
defens
of
bestial
it
is
absolut
irrelev
and
incompar
to
the
issu
gay
christian
do
rais
which
concern
sexual
activ
within
commit
consensu
human
adult
realtionship
so
that
your
bring
it
up
is
no
more
relev
than
the
law
of
kashrut
if
you
can
not
address
the
actual
issu
you
are
be
bloodi
dishonest
in
trail
thi
red
her
in
front
of
the
world
if
you
want
to
address
bestial
that
is
your
busi
not
mine
and
attempt
to
torpedo
a
seriou
issu
by
use
what
is
in
our
cultur
a
ridicul
joke
show
that
you
have
no
interest
in
hear
u
a
human
be
you
want
to
dismiss
u
and
use
the
sleaziest
mean
you
can
think
of
to
do
so
also
i
notic
that
the
preceed
vers
say
also
you
shall
not
approach
a
woman
to
uncov
her
naked
dure
her
menstrual
impur
and
you
shall
not
have
intercours
with
your
neighbor
wife
to
be
defil
with
her
leviticu
nasb
these
vers
are
just
a
relev
a
you
shall
not
lie
with
a
male
a
one
lie
with
a
femal
it
is
an
abomin
leviticu
