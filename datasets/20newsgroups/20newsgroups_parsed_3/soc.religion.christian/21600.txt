the

that
thing
that

anoth
possibl
is
that
the

we
are

a
the
chines

time
a
for
how
to
discrimin
the
bibl
doesnt
help
much
there
is
an
old
testament
passag
i
forget
where
it
is
that
say
you
will
know
whether
a
prophet
is
true
by
whether
or
not
hi
propheci
come
to
pa
that
help
elimin
the
failur
after
the

but
in
the
case
of
an
earth
quak
it
is
small
comfort
it
seem
to
me
that
all
propheci
that
give
specif
time
and
place
and
event
should
be
suspect
not
in
that
they
are
necessarili
fals
but
in
the
sens
state
abov
that
all
such
vision
are
subject
to
mistransl
from
the
plane
of
prophet
vision
to
the
plane
of
earthli
time
and
space
for
what
it
is
worth
rudolf
steiner
onc
wa
ask
whether
a
modern
initi
could
see
into
the
futur
and
predict
come
event
hi
answer
wa
that
it
would
be
possibl
but
then
he
would
have
to
withdraw
from
activ
parti
cipat
in
them
includ
proclaim
what
he
saw
if
thi
is
in
fact
a
spiritu
law
then
the
answer
to
your
question
about
how
to
discrimin
is
that
the
one
who
make
such
propheci
is
probabl
violat
that
law
knowingli
or
unknowingli
and
a
such
hi
messag
should
be
consid
a
priori
to
be
dubiou
ie
i
would
expect
that
those
capabl
of
make
true
predict
and
give
accur
express
to
them
would
not
do
so
in
the
way
that
the
prophet
of
the
oregon
earthquak
did
howev
i
can
sympath
with
the
person
who
publish
the
propheci
given
the
same
overwhelm
experi
that
he
appar
had
i
too
might
feel
impel
and
even
commiss
by
god
to
tell
my
fellow
human
be
about
what
i
had
seen
gerri
palo
do
ani
of
our
church
historian
reader
know
whether
there
ani
more
propheci
now
than
there
ha
been
in
the
past
i
dont
