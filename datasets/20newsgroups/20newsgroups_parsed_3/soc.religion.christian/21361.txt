re
serbian
genocid
work
of
god
note
i
am
not
the
origin
poster
i
am
just
answer
becaus
i
think
thi
is
import
in
articl
d
andrew
byler
write
write
evil
result
of
human
sin
rather
than
the
will
of
god
in
a
certain
sens
ye
but
in
the
sens
that
god
allow
evil
to
happen
when
obvious
he
be
god
he
could
have
not
had
it
happen
doe
in
a
certain
sens
mean
that
he
will
it
to
happen
god
doe
not
condon
evil
but
instead
us
it
for
good
a
you
say
howev
what
god
desir
must
be
seper
from
what
actual
happen
for
exampl
god
desir
that
all
should
be
save
timothi
howev
it
is
quit
obviou
that
nowher
near
all
are
save
wa
god
will
thwart
no
becaus
hi
will
can
not
be
escap
for
even
when
it
appear
that
it
is
your
will
do
someth
it
is
actual
the
will
of
god
which
by
hi
grace
ha
dispos
u
to
do
a
he
wish
so
we
come
to
the
age
old
question
whi
doe
evil
occur
to
which
we
must
answer
that
god
allow
evil
to
occur
though
he
doe
not
condon
it
so
that
hi
ultim
plan
may
be
brought
to
sucess
person
i
suggest
read
the
part
of
the
summa
theologica
of
st
thoma
that
deal
with
the
knowledg
of
god
to
get
a
good
grasp
on
thi
whole
idea
whoo
im
go
to
have
to
be
veri
care
with
my
languag
here
i
think
god
is
voluntarili
give
up
hi
omnisci
in
thi
world
so
that
we
can
decid
on
our
own
where
we
go
free
will
in
thi
sens
god
allow
evil
to
occur
and
in
thi
sens
can
be
held
respons
a
my
chaplain
say
howev
hi
will
is
of
cours
that
all
be
save
he
not
go
to
save
u
by
himself
we
have
to
take
a
step
in
hi
direct
befor
he
will
save
u
read
that
last
sentenc
care
im
not
say
we
save
ourselv
im
say
we
have
to
accept
our
salvat
i
do
not
believ
in
predestin
it
would
appear
from
what
you
say
further
down
that
you
do
stuff
delet
i
am
not
say
that
anyon
deserv
punish
more
than
someon
els
i
am
simpli
point
out
that
god
could
be
use
the
serbian
and
croatian
a
instrument
of
hi
punish
a
he
did
with
the
israelit
against
the
cannanit
ok
i
have
troubl
with
that
but
i
guess
that
one
of
those
thing
that
cant
be
resolv
by
argument
i
accept
your
interpret
more
delet
the
issu
is
not
question
whi
god
ha
made
the
world
in
the
way
god
so
choos
it
is
whether
i
am
discern
the
world
in
the
way
god
intend
it
the
debat
is
about
whether
we
should
not
oppos
the
serbian
in
their
ethnic
cleans
becaus
they
might
be
do
the
will
of
god
and
i
said
christian
should
not
be
particip
in
such
war
and
slaughter
that
doe
not
mitig
the
fact
that
god
allow
thi
evil
to
continu
for
he
is
patient
and
will
that
none
should
perish
so
he
wait
for
those
whom
he
ha
foreknown
to
turn
to
him
from
their
evil
thi
is
what
indic
to
me
that
you
may
believ
in
predestin
am
i
correct
i
do
not
believ
in
predestin
i
believ
we
all
choos
whether
or
not
we
will
accept
god
gift
of
salvat
to
u
again
fundament
differ
which
cant
realli
be
resolv
yet
more
delet
i
am
not
say
that
the
evil
befal
the
bosnian
is
justifi
by
their
guilt
i
am
say
that
it
is
possibl
that
god
is
punish
them
in
thi
way
in
no
way
is
thi
evil
justifi
bu
that
doe
not
mean
that
god
can
not
use
evil
to
further
hi
purpos
i
am
not
accus
the
bosnian
though
they
may
veri
well
be
guilti
of
great
sin
but
that
is
up
to
god
to
judg
we
are
all
defend
when
the
time
come
for
our
judgement
by
god
let
u
all
sincer
hope
and
pray
that
we
will
have
jesu
christ
a
our
advoc
at
that
judgement
ye
it
is
up
to
god
to
judg
but
he
will
onli
mete
out
that
punish
at
the
last
judgement
a
for
now
evil
can
be
done
by
human
be
that
is
not
god
will
and
the
best
we
can
do
is
see
taht
some
good
come
out
of
it
somehow
the
thing
that
most
worri
me
about
the
it
is
the
will
of
god
argument
is
that
thi
will
convinc
peopl
that
we
should
not
stop
the
rape
and
kill
when
i
think
that
it
is
most
christlik
to
do
just
that
if
jesu
stop
the
stone
of
an
adulter
woman
perhap
thi
is
not
a
good
parallel
but
im
go
to
go
with
it
anyway
whi
should
we
not
stop
the
murder
and
violat
of
peopl
who
may
or
may
not
be
more
