write
you
ask
where
we
are
i
would
echo
that
question
im
not
tri
to
be
contenti
but
assum
that
the
pope
ha
univers
jurisdict
and
author
what
author
do
you
reli
upon
for
your
decis
what
prevent
me
from
choos
ani
doctrin
i
like
and
say
that
papal
disagr
is
an
error
that
will
be
resolv
in
time
thi
is
especi
true
sinc
council
of
bishop
have
basic
stood
by
the
pope
the
ultim
question
is
the
tradit
theolog
of
the
church
thi
is
the
onli
thing
that
it
is
possibl
to
resist
a
pope
for
hi
departur
from
the
tradit
doctrin
of
the
church
if
command
from
ani
author
conflict
with
tradit
the
command
must
be
disobey
my
own
view
on
thi
is
that
thi
conflict
could
onli
happen
in
a
major
way
god
would
never
allow
a
hairsplit
situat
to
develop
it
would
be
too
complex
for
peopl
to
figur
out
i
dont
view
the
present
situat
in
the
church
a
anyth
extrem
complic
run
through
a
list
of
what
ha
happen
in
the
last
year
in
the
cathol
church
and
ani
imparti
observ
will
be
aghast
it
appear
that
much
of
what
lie
at
the
heart
of
thi
matter
is
disagr
over
what
is
tradit
and
tradit
and
also
over
author
and
disciplin
the
problem
stem
from
a
gener
widespread
ignor
of
the
cathol
faith
in
my
opinion
most
cathol
know
about
zilch
about
the
cathol
faith
thi
leaf
them
wide
open
for
destruct
by
er
bishop
it
basic
the
reform
part
ii
there
is
not
even
a
question
in
my
mind
that
in
some
respect
the
shard
of
the
cathol
church
are
current
be
trampl
upon
by
the
cathol
hierarchi
i
could
go
on
list
shock
thing
for
an
hour
probabl
take
the
situat
in
campo
brazil
for
exampl
im
read
a
book
on
what
happen
there
after
vatican
council
ii
the
bishop
antonio
de
castromay
never
introduc
all
the
chang
that
follow
in
the
wake
of
vatican
ii
he
kept
the
tradit
mass
the
same
old
catech
etc
he
made
sure
the
peopl
knew
their
faith
the
cathol
theolog
of
obedi
what
modern
wa
etc
he
innocul
the
peopl
against
what
wa
come
well
one
day
the
order
came
from
rome
for
hi
retir
it
came
when
the
pope
wa
sick
bishop
de
castromay
wait
until
the
pope
recov
then
inquir
whether
thi
command
wa
what
the
pope
realli
want
or
someth
that
some
liber
had
command
in
hi
absenc
the
pope
confirm
the
decis
so
the
good
bishop
retir
the
injustic
that
follow
wa
complet
incred
a
new
bishop
wa
instal
he
proceed
to
expel
most
of
bishop
de
castromay
clergi
from
their
church
becaus
they
refus
to
celebr
the
new
mass
the
new
bishop
would
visit
a
parish
and
celebr
a
new
mass
the
peopl
would
promptli
walk
out
of
the
church
en
mass
the
bishop
wa
enrag
by
thi
he
usual
resort
to
enlist
the
help
of
the
secular
author
to
eject
the
priest
from
the
church
the
priest
would
just
start
build
new
church
the
peopl
were
complet
behind
them
the
old
parish
had
the
new
mass
a
the
bishop
desir
and
virtual
no
parishion
the
prime
motiv
for
all
thi
wa
complet
illeg
accord
to
canon
law
no
priest
can
be
penal
in
ani
way
for
say
the
tradit
mass
becaus
of
legisl
enact
by
pope
saint
piu
v
nor
is
there
ani
oblig
to
say
the
new
mass
dure
all
thi
process
the
peopl
of
campo
not
just
privat
individu
but
includ
civil
author
were
constantli
send
petit
and
letter
to
rome
to
do
someth
about
the
new
modernist
bishop
noth
wa
ever
done
no
help
ever
arriv
from
rome
eventu
priest
were
kick
out
and
about
peopl
my
question
to
the
support
of
sspx
is
thi
is
there
ani
way
that
your
posit
with
respect
to
church
reform
could
chang
and
be
conform
to
those
of
the
pope
assum
that
the
pope
posit
doe
not
chang
and
that
the
leader
of
sspx
dont
jointli
make
such
choic
if
not
thi
appear
to
be
claim
infal
teach
author
if
i
adopt
the
view
that
im
not
wrong
i
cant
be
wrong
and
there
no
way
ill
chang
my
mind
you
must
chang
your
that
ive
either
left
the
cathol
church
or
it
ha
left
me
if
the
pope
defin
certain
thing
ex
cathedra
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
controversi
that
process
is
all
veri
well
understood
in
cathol
theolog
and
anyon
who
doesnt
go
along
with
it
is
an
instant
noncathol
the
problem
here
is
that
peopl
do
not
appreci
what
is
go
on
in
the
cathol
world
if
they
knew
the
faith
and
what
our
bishop
are
do
they
would
be
shock
we
sould
argu
from
now
until
the
second
come
about
what
the
real
tradit
teach
of
the
church
is
if
thi
were
a
simpl
matter
east
and
west
would
not
have
been
separ
for
over
year
thi
isnt
the
case
in
the
cathol
church
there
is
a
massiv
bodi
of
tradit
teach
the
pope
of
the
last
year
are
especi
relev
there
is
no
question
at
all
what
the
tradit
doctrin
is
i
thought
that
the
teach
magisterieum
of
the
church
did
not
allow
error
in
teach
regard
faith
and
moral
even
in
the
short
term
i
may
be
wrong
here
im
not
roman
cathol
that
heresi
more
or
le
although
they
have
done
a
great
job
sinc
the
reform
the
last
year
have
seen
so
mani
error
spread
that
it
piti
infal
rest
in
the
pope
and
in
the
church
a
a
whole
in
the
short
term
a
pope
or
larg
section
of
the
church
can
go
astray
in
fact
that
what
usual
happen
dure
a
major
heresi
larg
section
of
the
church
go
astray
the
pope
histor
ha
been
much
more
reliabl
everyth
will
alway
come
back
in
the
long
run
what
would
be
the
effect
of
a
pope
make
an
ex
cathedra
statement
regard
the
sspx
situat
would
it
be
honor
if
not
how
do
you
get
around
the
formal
doctrin
of
infal
again
im
not

one
way
or
the
other
ye
it
would
be

infal
is
infal
but
what
is
he
go
to
defin
that
the
new
mass
is
a
better
express
of
the
cathol
faith
than
the
old
that
sex
educ
in
the
cathol
school
is
wonder
that
all

except
for
that
