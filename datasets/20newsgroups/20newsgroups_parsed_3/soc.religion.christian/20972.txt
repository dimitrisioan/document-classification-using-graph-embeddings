the
discus
begin
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
at
all
one
of
the
law
of
natur
specifi
caus
and
effect
seem
to
dictat
at
least
to
thi
layman
mind
there
must
be
a
causal
event
no
reason
altern
exist
i
would
argu
that
causal
is
actual
a
properti
of
spacetim
caus
preced
their
effect
and
i
must
conced
here
caus
befor
effect
impli
time
time
is
part
of
spacetim
hen
the
argument
would
be
valid
i
could
return
and
say
that
thi
doe
not
infer
the
caus
and
effect
relationship
be
uniqu
to
thi
spacetim
but
i
wont
becaus
the
point
is
moot
doesnt
address
whi
which
petri
pikho
address
below
i
also
conced
that
i
wa
doubli
remiss
a
i
assert
no
reason
altern
exist
an
entir
subject
statement
on
my
part
and
one
that
could
be
invalid
given
time
and
further
discoveri
by
the
scientist
i
also
understand
that
a
prove
a
theori
doe
not
necessarili
specifi
that
thi
is
how
it
happen
but
propos
a
like
descript
of
the
phenomenon
in
question
am
i
mistaken
with
thi
understand
but
if
you
claim
that
there
must
be
an
answer
to
how
did
the
univers
our
spacetim
emerg
from
noth
scienc
ha
some
good
candid
for
an
answer
all
of
which
requir
someth
we
christian
readili
admit
to
faith
the
fact
that
there
are
sever
candid
beli
that
none
are
conclus
with
out
conclus
evid
we
are
left
with
faith
it
could
even
be
argu
that
one
of
these
hypothes
may
one
day
be
proven
a
best
a
a
nonrepeat
event
can
be
proven
but
i
ask
what
hold
someon
today
to
the
belief
that
ani
or
all
of
them
are
correct
except
by
faith
a
coupl
of
paragraph
delet
summari
we
ask
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
i
think
thi
question
should
actual
be
split
into
two
part
name
whi
is
there
exist
whi
anyth
exist
and
how
did
the
univers
emerg
from
noth
it
is
clear
scienc
ha
noth
to
say
about
the
first
question
howev
is
it
a
meaning
question
after
all
i
would
say
it
isnt
consid
the
follow
appar
it
is
for
mani
person
henc
we
have
religion
the
question
whi
anyth
exist
can
be
counter
by
demand
answer
to
a
question
whi
there
is
noth
in
nothing
or
in
nonexist
actual
both
question
turn
out
to
be
devoid
of
mean
thing
that
exist
do
and
thing
that
dont
exist
dont
exist
tautolog
at
it
best
care
examin
the
origin
question
and
then
the
counterquest
the
first
ask
whi
while
the
second
is
a
request
for
definit
it
doesnt
address
whi
someth
doe
or
doe
not
exist
but
ask
to
defin
the
lack
of
exist
the
second
question
is
unanswer
inde
for
how
do
we
identifi
someth
a
noth
arent
they
mutual
exclus
term
how
do
we
identifi
a
state
of
nonexist
again
thi
is
near
the
limit
of
thi
simpl
layman
abil
to
comprehend
and
i
would
appreci
an
explan
i
might
add
the
worldview
of
thing
that
exist
do
and
thing
that
dontdont
is
a
ground
in
the
realm
of
the
nonfalsifi
a
doe
the
theist
belief
in
god
it
is
base
on
the
assumpt
that
there
is
not
a
reason
for
be
someth
a
ultim
unsupport
a
the
posit
of
there
be
a
reason
it
veri
foundat
exist
in
the
same
soil
a
that
of
one
who
claim
there
is
a
reason
we
come
to
thi
either
i
am
therefor
i
am
or
i
am
for
a
reason
if
the
former
is
a
satisfactori
answer
then
you
are
done
for
you
are
satisfi
and
need
not
a
doctor
if
the
latter
your
search
is
just
begin
i
serious
doubt
god
could
have
an
answer
to
thi
question
time
will
tell
some
christian
i
have
talk
to
have
said
that
actual
god
is
himself
the
exist
howev
i
see
sever
problem
with
thi
answer
first
it
inevit
lead
to
the
conclus
that
god
is
actual
all
exist
good
and
evil
devil
and
angel
u
and
them
thi
is
pantheism
not
christian
agre
it
would
lead
me
to
question
their
definit
of
christian
a
well
anoth
answer
is
that
god
is
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
sound
much
better
but
i
am
tempt
to
ask
doe
god
himself
exist
then
if
god
is
the
sourc
of
hi
own
exist
it
can
onli
mean
that
he
ha
in
term
of
human
time
alway
exist
but
thi
is
not
the
same
a
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
doe
not
preclud
hi
exist
it
onli
seek
to
identifi
hi
qualiti
impli
he
exist
to
have
qualiti
btw
the
best
answer
i
have
heard
is
that
human
reason
is
incap
of
understand
such
question
be
an
atheist
myself
i
do
not
accept
such
answer
sinc
i
do
not
have
ani
other
method
like
the
theist
we
come
to
a
statement
of
faith
for
thi
posit
assum
that
the
evid
at
hand
is
conclus
note
i
am
not
argu
against
scientif
endeavor
for
scienc
is
use
for
understand
the
univers
in
which
we
exist
but
i
differ
from
the
atheist
in
a
matter
of
perspect
i
seek
to
understand
what
exist
to
understand
and
appreci
the
art
of
the
creator
i
also
have
discov
scienc
is
an
inadequ
tool
to
answer
whi
it
appear
that
m
pihko
agre
a
we
shall
see
but
becaus
a
tool
is
inadequ
to
answer
a
question
doe
not
preclud
the
question
assert
that
whi
is
an
invalid
question
doe
not
provid
an
answer
a
far
a
i
can
tell
the
veri
law
of
natur
demand
a
whi
that
isnt
true
of
someth
outsid
of
natur
ie
supernatur
thi
is
not
true
scienc
is
a
collect
of
model
tell
u
how
not
whi
someth
happen
i
can
not
see
ani
good
reason
whi
the
whi
question
would
be
bound
onli
to
natur
thing
assum
that
the
supernatur
domain
exist
if
supernatur
be
exist
it
is
a
appropri
to
ask
whi
they
do
so
a
it
is
to
ask
whi
we
exist
my
apolog
i
wa
use
whi
a
whi
did
thi
come
to
be
whi
did
preexist
becom
exist
whi
did
prespacetim
becom
spacetim
but
we
come
to
the
admiss
that
scienc
fail
to
answer
whi
becaus
it
cant
be
answer
in
the
realm
of
modern
scienc
doe
that
make
the
question
invalid
i
dont
believ
ani
technolog
would
be
abl
to
produc
that
necessari
spark
of
life
despit
have
all
of
the
part
avail
just
my
opinion
thi
opinion
is
also
call
vital
name
that
live
system
are
somehow
fundament
differ
from
inanim
system
do
christian
in
gener
adopt
thi
posit
what
would
happen
when
scientist
announc
they
have
creat
primit
life
say
small
bacteria
in
a
lab
i
suppos
we
would
do
the
same
thing
a
when
galileo
or
capernicu
wa
vindic

jump
up

down

note
i
said
vindic
i
certainli
hope
weve
gotten
beyond
the
shoot
the
messeng
stage
m
pihko
doe
present
a
good
point
though
we
may
need
to
ask
what
do
i
a
an
individu
christian
base
my
faith
on
will
it
be
shaken
by
the
product
of
evid
that
shatter
our
sacr
cow
or
will
we
seek
to
understand
if
a
new
discoveri

disagre
with
