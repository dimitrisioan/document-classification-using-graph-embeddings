assumpt
cathol
believ
that
the
bless
virgin
mari
went
to
heaven
bodi
and
soul
at
the
end
of
her
life
thi
is
unusu
becaus
the
normal
cours
of
event
is
for
your
bodi
to
decay
in
the
grave
and
stay
that
way
until
the
resurrect
of
the
dead
well
it
wasnt
that
way
for
enoch
and
elijah
both
of
whom
were
translat
directli
into
heaven
it
beyond
my
grasp
whi
some
object
that
mari
who
wa
far
greater
than
either
enoch
or
elijah
should
not
benefit
from
the

it
should
be
note
that
the

it
might
be
argu
by
some
protest
that
the
cathol

up
but
the
monophysit
put
a
