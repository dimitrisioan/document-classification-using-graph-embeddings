respons
delet
dariu
it
not
clear
how
much
more
need
to
be
said
other
than
the
faq
i
think
paul
comment
on
esteem
one
day
over
anoth
rom
is
probabl
all
that
need
to
be
said
i
accept
that
dariu
is
do
what
he
doe
in
honor
of
the
lord
i
just
wish
he
might
equal
accept
that
those
who
esteem
all
day
alik
are
similarli
do
their
best
to
honor
the
lord
i
am
myself
an
sda
and
i
am
in
total
agreement
with
what
dariu
ha
to
say
i
also
worship
on
saturday
to
honor
the
lord
your
mention
of
esteem
all
day
alik
imo
ha
to
do
with
the
fast
day
observ
by
the
jew
but
no
matter
how
you
interpret
that
passag
i
do
accept
your
worship
on
sunday
a
be
done
in
honor
of
the
lord
in
contrast
with
what
mani
of
my
fellow
sda
believ
may
believ
to
me
though
the
bibl
overwhelmingli
point
to
saturday
a
the
day
to
be
kept
in
honor
of
creation
and
of
god
deliver
of
the
israelit
from
egyptian
bondag
to
those
who
would
attempt
to
point
out
that
my
observ
of
saturday
is
be
legalist
thi
is
simpli
not
the
case
rather
keep
saturday
allow
me
a
full
day
to
rest
and
contempl
god
good
and
grace
howev
id
like
to
be
clear
that
i
do
not
think
there
unambigu
proof
that
regular
christian
worship
wa
on
the
first
day
a
i
indic
there
are
respons
on
both
of
the
passag
cite
similarli
with
cor
it
say
that
on
the
first
day
they
should
set
asid
money
for
paul
collect
now
if
you
want
to
believ
that
they
gather
special
to
do
thi
or
that
they
did
it
in
their
home
i
cant
disprov
it
but
the
obviou
time
for
a
congreg
to
take
an
offer
would
be
when
they
normal
gather
for
worship
and
if
they
were
expect
to
do
it
in
their
home
there
would
be
no
reason
to
mention
a
specif
day
the
idea
wa
introduc
to
me
onc
that
the
reason
paul
want
the
corinthian
to
lay
asid
money
for
the
collect
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
wa
becaus
that
wa
when
they
receiv
their
weekli
wage
paul
want
them
to
lay
asid
money
for
the
collect
a
first
prioriti
befor
spend
their
money
on
other
thing
i
do
not
have
ani
proof
in
front
of
me
for
thi
though
although
it
would
explain
whi
they
would
lay
asid
money
in
their
home
instead
of
a
meet
so
i
think
the
most
obviou
read
of
thi
is
that
on
the
first
day
of
everi
week
simpli
mean
everi
time
they
gather
for
worship
i
think
the
reason
we
have
onli
implic
and
not
clear
statement
is
that
the
nt
author
assum
that
their
reader
knew
when
christian
worship
wa
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
assum
that
the
christian
in
the
nt
regularli
worship
on
the
first
day
i
assum
that
the
christian
in
the
nt
regularli
worship
on
the
seventh
day
but
i
agre
with
you
that
we
onli
have
implic
becaus
the
author
did
assum
the
reader
knew
when
worhip
wa
