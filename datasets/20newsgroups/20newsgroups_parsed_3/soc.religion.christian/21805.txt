dear
fellow
christian
i
had
a
dinner
last
night
with
a
bibl
studi
group
which
i
am
in
we
had
a
discus
about
the
differ
between
christian
and
islam
and
i
wa
shock
to
hear
that
our
bibl
studi
teacher
said
that
mohammad
wa
inde
a
prophet
but
of
satan
i
said
what
i
did
not
believ
that
becaus
i
have
some
moslem
friend
who
are
so
kind
and
nice
even
sometim
i
feel
i
wish
i
could
be
like
them
in
my
point
of
view
they
dont
sin
a
much
a
i
do
how
come
if
they
were
under
satan
they
could
have
such
person
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
dont
know
much
about
islam
but
i
know
that
they
believ
in
god
they
believ
in
the
day
of
judgement
now
im
ask
you
what
your
opinion
about
islam
and
it
teach
import
i
do
not
want
to
discus
whether
they
are
save
or
not
i

you
tabut
torsina
let
me
start
by
say
that
thi
is
not
the
right
newsgroup
for
a
discus
of
islam
sinc
there
a
group
for
that
but
i
suspect
the
point
your
teacher
wa
make
wa
not
specif
about
islam
inde
it
go
to
be
imposs
to
see
what
he
wa
get
at
within
your
groundrul
sinc
the
question
of
whether
nonchristian
are
save
is
at
the
heart
of
it
the
classic
christian
view
which
i
think
most
peopl
believ
until
the
last
centuri
or
so
wa
that
christian
and
of
cours
judaism
wa
the
onli
religion
found
by
god
and
that
all
other
religion
worship
fals
god
and
came
from
satan
thi
is
more
or
le
a
corollari
of
anoth
tradit
view
that
no
one
but
christian
and
possibl
jew
will
be
save
thi
need
not
mean
that
there
no
truth
in
ani
other
religion
nor
that
all
of
their
member
are
intent
satan
after
all
in
order
to
be
an
effect
snare
satan
altern
would
have
to
be
attract
thu
they
might
contain
all
kind
of
truth
wisdom
and
spiritu
insight
they
would
be
miss
onli
one
thing
knowledg
of
salvat
through
christ
if
thi
is
the
background
of
your
teacher
remark
and
i
suspect
it
is
that
mean
that
a
discus
of
islam
is
not
necessarili
relev
the
point
is
not
that
there
anyth
intrins
wrong
with
it
it
may
teach
a
fine
code
of
behavior
and
it
practition
may
all
be
wonder
peopl
but
if
salvat
requir
be
a
follow
of
christ
it
could
still
be
a
satan
invent
thi
is
a
reason
deduct
from
the
classic
protest
posit
christian
say
that
salvat
isnt
a
matter
of
be
kind
and
nice
those
are
good
thing
and
we
should
encourag
them
but
no
one
is
abl
to
do
them
enough
to
be
save
salvat
requir
christ
plea
forgiv
me
for
do
thi
in
protest
term
there
a
cathol
equival
to
thi
that
ha
similar
implic
but
in
differ
term
a
religion
may
be
quit
attract
in
all
visibl
way
but
if
it
doesnt
have
christ
it
like
a
diet
that
consist
of
food
that
look
wonder
tast
great
but
is
miss
some
essenti
food
element
so
that
you
end
up
die
let
me
be
clear
that
i
am
not
specif
advoc
thi
posit
what
im
tri
to
do
is
a
usual
to
clarifi
issu
inde
it
is
now
rel
uncommon
for
christian
to
believ
that
all
other
religion
are
satan
most
christian
regard
such
belief
a
an
unfortun
vestig
of
the
past
thi
is
part
of
a
gener
move
within
christian
in
the
last
centuri
or
so
to
a
nonjudgement
god
christian
now
find
it
hard
to
believ
that
god
would
allow
anybodi
other
than
a
realli
rotten
person
to
end
up
in
hell
and
they
find
it
hard
to
envis
that
real
malign
spiritu
forc
are
at
work
in
the
world
do
thing
like
creat
superfici
attract
altern
to
christian
whether
there
is
actual
a
sound
basi
for
the
shift
is
a
decis
that
peopl
need
to
make
for
themselv
