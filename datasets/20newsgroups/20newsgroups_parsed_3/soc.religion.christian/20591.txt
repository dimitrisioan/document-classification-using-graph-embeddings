re
the
arrog
of
christian
in
articl
melinda
hsu
write
belief
that
their
faith
is
total
truth
accord
to
them
their
belief
come
from
the
bibl
and
the
bibl
is
the
word
of
god
and
god
is
truth
thu
they
know
the
truth
thi
stanc
make
it
difficult
to
discu
other
faith
with
them
and
my
own
hesit
about
christian
becaus
they
see
no
other
way
their
way
is
the
truth
but
i
see
their
faith
aris
from
a
will
choic
to
believ
a
particular
way
that
choic
is
part
faith
and
part
reason
but
it
seem
to
me
a
choic
my
discuss
with
some
christian
remind
me
of
schoolyard
discuss
when
i
wa
in
grade
school
a
kid
would
say
all
policeman
are
jerk
id
ask
how
do
you
know
becaus
my
daddi
told
me
so
how
do
you
know
your
daddi
is
right
he
say
he
alway
right
well
the
argument
usual
stop
right
there
in
the
end
arent
we
all
just
kid
grope
for
the
truth
if
so
do
we
have
the
author
to
declar
all
other
belief
besid
our
own
a
fals
i
find
thi
argument
veri
strang
though
not
unfamiliar
an
analog
someon
use
a
while
back
can
perhap
illustr
it
say
for
exampl
there
are
peopl
live
on
a
volcan
island
and
a
group
of
geologist
determin
that
a
volcano
is
immin
they
warn
the
peopl
on
the
island
that
they
are
in
danger
and
should
leav
a
group
of
peopl
on
the
island
is
given
the
task
of
warn
other
of
the
danger
they
believ
the
danger
is
real
but
other
may
not
doe
that
mean
that
the
first
group
are
necessarili
arrog
in
warn
other
of
the
danger
doe
it
mean
that
they
are

that
their
belief
are
correct
and
all
other
