write
i
hate
to
sound
flippant
have
shot
off
my
mouth
badli
on
the
net
befor
but
im
afraid
that
much
of
thi
materi
onli
add
to
my
feel
that
the
assumpt
of
mari
would
be
better
phrase
our
assumpt
about
mari
in
all
the
time
ive
been
read
about
mari
on
thi
group
i
can
not
recal
read
much
about
mari
that
did
not
sound
like
wish
vener
with
scant
if
ani
scriptur
foundat
i
find
in
the
new
testament
a
veri
real
portrait
of
christ
parent
a
compellingli
human
person
to
be
honor
and
admir
for
their
humil
and
submiss
to
god
work
beyond
doubt
but
the
almalga
mation
of
theori
and
dogma
that
ha
accret
around
them
give
me
an
imag
of
alien
and
inhuman
creatur
untouch
by
sin
or
human
desir
onli
christ
himself
wa
so
truli
sanctifi
and
even
he
knew
temptat
albeit
without
submit
to
it
i
also
dont
see
the
necess
of
say
the
holi
parent
were
some
how
sanctifi
beyond
normal
human
it
sound
like
our
own
inabl
to
grasp
the
immens
of
god
grace
in
be
incarn
through
an
or
dinari
human
be
i
wont
start
yell
about
how
peopl
are
worship
mari
etc
sinc
folk
have
told
me
otherwis
about
that
but
i
do
think
we
lose
part
of
the
wonder
of
god
incarn
in
christ
when
we
make
hi
parent
out
to
be
sinless
sexless
deathless

paul
you
did
a
wonder
job
of
not
do
anyth
humani
possibl
to
offend
u
cathol
hope
i
can
be
just
a
care
in
my
word
a
you
were
i
also
dont
want
to
extend
thi
topic
into
an
entir
major
issu
of
debat
anymor
than
it
alreadi
is
but
just
a
note
or
two
pleas
dont
talk
about
jesu
parentsth
doctrin
posit
of
the
church
an
unequivoc
differ
regard
mari
and
joseph
i
person
have
never
heard
of
anyth
be
attribut
to
st
joseph
other
than
hi
sainthood
that
is
no
refer
ever
to
him
be
sinless
assum
into
heaven
immacul
conceiv
etcal
these
idea
appli
onli
to
mari
i
would
agre
there
is
veri
littl
scriptur
evid
for
our
doctrin
about
mari
needl
to
say
that
present
a
signific
problem
to
those
who
accept
the
bibl
a
the
onli
sourc
of
doctrin
if
howev
one
turn
to
the
sacr
tradit
of
the
undivid
christian
church
there
is
no
problem
find
plentli
of
evid
that
it
wa
basic
a
unanim
belief
among
the
apostl
and
all
the
earli
gener
that
mari
wa
assum
into
heaven
bodi
and
soul
etc
etc
it
wasnt
until
the
reform
that
these
doctrin
were
call
into
question
a
far
a
i
am
concern
again
my
personali
feel
if
it
a
choic
between
the
apostl
or
luther
ill
choos
the
apostl
everi
time
whether
or
not
it
is
record
within
the
write
that
the
tradit
of
men
have
determin
to
be
the
bibl
like
a
said
just
a
coupl
of
note
a
is
often
said
i
believ
that
we
must
agre
to
polit
disagre
may
god
peac
