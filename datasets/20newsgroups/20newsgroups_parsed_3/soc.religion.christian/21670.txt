it
that
paul
through
the
inspir
of
the
holi
spirit
is
call
u
to

the
opposit
to
love
your
fellow
man
consid
some
sin
now
let
appli
our
hate
the
sin
philosophi
and
see
what
happen
if
we
truli
hate
the
sin
then
the
more
we
see
it
the
stronger
our
hatr
of
it
will
becom
eventu
thi
hate
becom
so
strong
that
we
becom
disgust
with
the
sinner
and
eventu
come
to
hate
the
sinner
that
ha
not
been
my
experi
ive
not
found
myself
hate
anybodi
a
a
result
of
hate
the
sin
that
may
be
in
their
life
a
a
sinner
myself
i
find
myself
have
more
compass
for
the
person
jesu
too
sinc
the
bibl
teach
that
he
wa
tempt
in
everi
way
that
we
are
is
abl
to
have
compass
on
u
when
we
our
tempt
and
fall
jesu
is
our
veri
exampl
of
how
to
hate
the
sin
but
love
the
sinner
in
the
account
of
the
woman
caught
in
adulteri
john
jesu
had
compass
on
the
woman
but
he
also
call
her
to
leav
her
life
of
sin
thi
is
what
it
mean
to
love
sinner
but
hate
their
sin
it
mean
love
them
uncondit
while
at
the
same
time
call
them
to
leav
their
sin
in
addit
our
hatr
of
the
sin
often
caus
u
to
say
and
do
thing
which
are
taken
person
by
the
sinner
who
often
doe
not
even
believ
what
they
are
do
is
a
sin
the
blame
for
thi
can
not
alway
be
laid
at
the
foot
of
the
christian
i
have
seen
and
been
guilti
of
take
offens
by
someon
mere
point
out
my
sin
and
call
me
to
repent
of
it
it
wa
not
unlov
for
the
christian
to
call
me
out
of
sin
in
fact
i
believ
it
wa
the
most
love
thing
that
that
person
could
have
done
he
love
me
enough
to
want
to
spare
me
the
consequ
of
remain
in
my
sin
after
enough
of
thi
the
sinner
begin
to
hate
u
they
certainli
dont
love
u
for
our
constant
critic
of
their
behavior
hate
build
up
and
drive
peopl
away
from
godthi
certainli
can
not
be
a
good
way
to
build
love
again
i
dont
think
that
you
can
lay
the
blame
for
thi
at
the
foot
of
the
christian
if
we
have
love
them
a
jesu
love
sinner
exemplifi
in
john
and
the
sinner
hate
u
for
it
then
we
have
done
the
best
we
can
we
will
have
extend
to
them
the
most
perfect
express
of
love
and
they
will
have
reject
it
now
it
we
hate
the
sin
but
forget
to
love
the
sinner
then
inde
we
will
ourselv
be
in
sin
in
the
summari
of
the
law
christ
command
u
to
love
god
and
to
love
our
neighbor
he
doesnt
say
anyth
about
hate
i
would
like
to
encourag
you
to
do
a
word
studi
on
hate
in
the
new
testament
i
realli
think
that
you
will
be
surpris
in
fact
if
anyth
he
command
u
to
save
our
critic
for
ourselv
critic
is
veri
differ
from
call
a
sinner
to
repent
hope

help
