their

let
me
suggest
thi
mayb
those
who
believ
in
the
etern
hell
theori
should
provid
all
the
biblic
evid
they
can
find
for
it
stay
away
from
human
theori
and
onli
take
into
account
refer
in
the
bibl
you
ask
for
it
peter
ff
talk
about
how
those
who
are
ungodli
are
punish
matthew
is
also
veri
clear
that
those
who
do
not
righteou
in
god
eye
will
be
sent
to
hell
for
etern
thessalonian
state
that
those
who
caus
troubl
for
the
discipl
will
be
punish
with
everlast
destruct
and
shut
out
from
the
presenc
of
the
lord
thessalonian
talk
about
those
who
refus
to
love
the
truth
be
condemn
revel
talk
about
the
differ
between
those
who
overcom
and
those
who
do
not
those
who
do
not
list
in
vers
will
be
in
the
fieri
lake
of
burn
sulfur
revel
give
the
indic
that
those
who
follow
the
beast
will
be
torment
with
burn
sulfur
and
there
be
no
rest
day
or
night
for
them
becaus
of
it
psalm
the
wick
return
to
the
grave
all
the
nation
that
forget
god
i
think
those
should
be
suffici
to
prove
the
point
dariu
joe
fisher
in
the
follow
im
mostli
play
devil
advoc
im
not
advoc
either
posit
my
concern
is
that
peopl
understand
that
it
possibl
to
see
these
passag
in
differ
way
it
possibl
to
see
etern
destruct
a
just
that
destruct
rev
often
use
the
term
second
death
the
most
obviou
understand
of
that
would
seem
to
be
final
extinct
the
problem
is
that
the
nt
speak
both
of
etern
punish
and
of
second
death
ie
it
use
term
that
can
be
understood
either
way
my
concern
here
is
not
to
convinc
you
of
one
view
or
the
other
but
to
help
peopl
understand
that
there
a
wide
enough
varieti
of
imag
that
it
possibl
to
understand
them
either
way
a
tom
albrecht
comment
the
primari
point
is
to
do
our
best
to
keep
peopl
out
of
the
etern
fire
whatev
the
detail
to
make
thing
more
interest
luke
impli
that
the
damn
dont
get
resurrect
at
all
presum
they
just
stay
dead
ye
im
awar
that
it
possibl
to
understand
thi
passag
in
a
nonliter
way
peter
ff
is
talk
about
angel
and
talk
about
hold
them
in
hell
until
the
final
judgement
thi
isnt
etern
punish
matthew
talk
about
send
the
cur
into
etern
fire
prepar
for
the
devil
and
hi
angel
the
fact
that
the
fire
is
etern
doesnt
mean
that
peopl
will
last
in
it
flame
forev
particularli
interest
is
the
comment
about
the
fire
have
been
prepar
for
the
devil
and
hi
angel
rev
and
talk
about
the
etern
fire
a
well
they
say
that
the
beast
and
the
fals
prophet
will
be
torment
forev
in
it
when
talk
about
peopl
be
thrown
into
it
it
is
refer
to
a
the
second
death
thi
sound
more
like
extinct
than
etern
torment
is
is
possibl
that
the
fire
ha
differ
effect
on
supernatur
entiti
such
a
the
devil
and
human
thessalonian
similarli
what
is
everlast
destruct
thi
is
not
necessarili
etern
torment
thi
one
can
clearli
be
understood
either
way
but
i
think
it
at
least
possibl
to
think
that
everlast
is
be
use
to
contrast
the
kind
of
destruct
that
can
occur
in
thi
life
with
the
final
destruct
that
occur
in
etern
thessalonian
again
talk
about
destruct
revel
see
comment
abov
revel
is
probabl
the
best
of
the
quot
even
there
it
doesnt
explicitli
say
that
the
peopl
suffer
forev
it
say
that
the
smoke
and
presum
the
fire
is
etern
and
that
there
is
no
respit
from
it
but
it
doesnt
say
that
the
peopl
are
torment
