write
to
sublim
a
cultur
for
the
sake
of
what
you
perceiv
a
uniti
seem
antithet
to
the
veri
messag
of
inclus
that
you
preach
i
agre
with
the
except
that
i
dont
preach
ignor
our
cultur
the
bodi
a
a
whole
must
be
unifi
the
question
is
shall
we
be
a
melt
pot
boil
ourselv
down
to
one
legitim
express
or
shall
we
be
more
like
a
stew
maintain
the
textur
integr
of
the
express
divers
while
uphold
the
uniti
of
thought
it
releas
all
church
from
the
use
of
the
latin
mass
uniti
to
allow
them
to
speak
to
the
peopl
in
the
common
languag
divers
in
revel
we
see
that
in
the
first
centuri
church
there
wa
one
congreg
in
each
major
citi
so
there
wa
one
unifi
church
now
in
each
citi
there
were
peopl
of
differ
cultur
natur
they
form
someth
of
a
stew
with
differ
member
have
differ
heritag
nevertheless
they
were
one
bodi
they
met
togeth
sometim
a
smaller
group
in
their
home
and
sometim
in
bigger
group
in
place
such
a
the
templ
court
now
in
a
particular
citi
then
and
now
you
will
find
that
there
is
a
common
languag
associ
with
that
region
for
instanc
in
rome
latin
wa
spoken
in
the
unit
state
today
english
is
spoken
so
it
would
make
sens
that
congreg
in
differ
citi
would
speak
the
common
languag
and
not
necessarili
latin
natur
you
would
expect
the
lead
evangelist
to
preach
in
the
common
languag
in
the
first
centuri
church
there
were
probabl
mani
peopl
in
the
congreg
who
could
speak
a
given
tongu
to
translat
the
messag
for
peopl
of
foreign
ethnic
group
today
howev
you
dont
see
peopl
speak
in
tongu
to
translat
sermon
even
in
socal
pentacost
church
we
do
have
a
modern
day
equival
though
bilingu
speaker
now
in
the
unifi
church
of
which
i
am
a
member
sometim
call
the
intern
church
of
christ
when
we
all
meet
togeth
on
sunday
there
are
headphon
on
peopl
who
dont
speak
english
from
which
they
hear
an
ongo
translat
of
the
sermon
in
their
nativ
tongu
neat
idea
huh
now
we
meet
in
differ
size
group
in
a
random
sort
of
way
on
sunday
so
sometim
there
will
be
a
meet
of
onli
haitian
or
of
spanish
speak
peopl
for
exampl
who
will
hear
an
evangelist
preach
in
their
nativ
languag
in
addit
we
meet
in
small
group
a
coupl
of
time
dure
the
week
for
bibl
discuss
group
and
devot
so
someon
who
speak
a
differ
languag
will
almost
alway
be
with
peopl
who
also
speak
hi
languag
assum
the
congreg
is
larg
enough
for
those
meet
a
for
the
peopl
who
speak
the
common
languag
they
can
keep
in
touch
with
their
cultur
if
they
want
but
they
will
also
have
equal
deep
friendship
among
their
church
relationship
with
peopl
of
mani
variou
nation
ha
the
purpos
of
the
church
been
thwart
by
thi
action
the
action
of
let
cathol
worship
in
a
nativ
languag
instead
of
latin
inde
not
see
my
second
paragraph
in
respons
to
the
second
clip
of
your
articl
howev
if
you
mean
the
action
of
form
denomin
base
on
a
cultur
then
the
purpos
of
the
church
ha
been
inde
thwart
ill
assum
the
second
possiblil
when
answer
your
next
clip
rather
i
believ
it
ha
been
enhanc
for
paul
exhort
u
to
becom
a
one
of
them
that
we
might
reach
them
thu
if
a
person
or
group
of
peopl
feel
more
comfort
among
their
own
shall
we
not
give
them
a
place
where
they
can
feel
comfort
with
their
heritag
and
still
love
god
my
guess
aaron
you
have
met
some
need
of
peopl
certainli
by
help
them
to
be
proud
of
their
cultur
heritag
when
most
denomin
didnt
yet
you
have
larg
isol
yourselv
from
have
qualiti
christian
friendship
outsid
your
nation
and
your
denomin
we
shall
certainli
give
peopl
a
place
to
feel
comfort
with
their
heritag
howev
we
will
do
thi
in
a
way
that
doe
not
destroy
church
uniti
but
rather
encourag
friendship
among
all
discipl
thi
is
the
approach
of
some
of
the
group
that
you
cite
it
sound
like
these
group
have
wonder
intent
but
they
are
go
about
thing
in
the
wrong
way
and
name
like
the
african
methodist
episcop
church
still
make
me
cring
although
not
a
much
a
befor
i
understand
that
there
wa
more
racism
in
the
past
that
caus
such
group
to
be
form
but
now
we
should
tri
to
unit
i
know
that
it
hard
for
mani
peopl
on
thi
newsgroup
to
imagin
there
be
onli
one
bodi
of
peopl
on
earth
but
it
is
quit
possibl
and
i
am
work
to
make
it
happen
howev
what
might
be
a
smaller
step
toward
uniti
would
be
take
the
word
african
out
of
your
denomin
name
then
perhap
someday
a
long
time
off
you
can
also
remov
the
methodist
episcop
part
also
and
simpli
be
part
of
the
church
with
regard
to
inclus
i
note
tht
your
sig
emit
from
mit
a
you
know
the
tute
is
religi
and
cultur
diversifi
and
not
everyon
who
come
there
is
immedi
comfort
with
english
much
le
american
cultur
what
shall
be
the
conduct
of
the
campu
church
then
shall
there
be
one
church
for
the
sake
of
uniti
or
shall
the
organ
like
kcf
be
use
in
help
student
new
to
america
make
the
transit
in
cultur
languag
and
thought
there
shall
be
one
church
for
the
sake
of
uniti
and
it
shall
be
use
in
help
student
new
to
america
make
the
transit
in
cultur
languag
and
thought
we
shouldnt
make
a
new
denomin
to
tri
to
solv
problem
the
whole
denomin
mindset
onli
caus
more
problem
sadli
in
the
