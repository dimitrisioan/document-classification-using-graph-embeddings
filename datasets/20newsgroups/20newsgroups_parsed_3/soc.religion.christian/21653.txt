a
bit
recent
often

to
digress
into
an
argument
a
to
whether
or
not
someth
is
a
sin
now
let
appli
our
hate
the
sin
philosophi
and
see
what
happen
if
we
truli
hate
the
sin
then
the
more
we
see
it
the
stronger
our
hatr
of
it
will
becom
eventu
thi
hate
becom
so
strong
that
we
becom
disgust
with
the
sinner
and
eventu
come
to
hate
the
sinner
in
addit
our
hatr
of
the
sin
often
caus
u
to
say
and
do
thing
which
are
taken
person
by
the
sinner
who
often
doe
not
even
believ
what
they
are
do
is
a
sin
after
enough
of
thi
the
sinner
begin
to
hate
u
they
certainli
dont
love
u
for
our
constant
critic
of
their
behavior
hate
build
up
and
drive
peopl
away
from

not
be
a
good
way
to
build

i
can
onli
speak
for
myself

easi
to

abov
ive
felt
it
with
my
friend
more
than
onc
there
is
a
veri
import
part
of
christian
that
youv
overlook
abov
and
make
it
possibl
to
love
the
sin
but
hate
the
sinner
befor
i
look
at
someon
el
life

a
disgust
by
what

see
in

a
i
see
in

contradictori
to

that
