i
find
that
i
am
dissatisfi
with
the
littl
purpos
that
we
can
manufactur
for
ourselv
littl
in
the
cosmic
sens
ah
in
the
cosmic
senc
but
who
life
in
the
cosmic
senc
not
me
cosmicli
we
dont
even
exist
for
all
practic
purpos
i
can
hardli
use
the
cosmic
senc
of
stuff
a
a
guid
to
life
it
would
just
say
dont
bother
luckili
for
mortal
there
are
mani
senc
of
scale
you
can
talk
about
in
a
human
senc
you
can
have
big
purpos
even
the
greatest
of
the
great
pharo
are
long
gone
the
pyramid
histor
odditi
be
worn
down
by
the
wind
eventu
to
be
turn
into
dust
but
the
influenc
of
aristotl
confuci
alexand
ceasar
and
countless
other
is
still
with
u
although
their
work
have
perish
but
they
have
chang
to
cours
of
histori
and
while
human
exist
their
deed
can
not
be
said
to
have
come
to
noth
even
if
they
are
utterli
forgotten
mankind
itself
will
one
day
perish
one
day
sure
well
unless
you
believ
in
the
second
come
which
i
do
not
but
in
that
time
we
can
make
a
differ
without
some
interconnected
that
transcend
the
physic
without
god
it
is
all
pointless
in
the
end
in
the
end
but
it
must
be
the
end
until
then
there
is
all
the
point
you
can
muster
and
when
that
end
come
there
will
be
nobodi
to
ask
gee
i
dont
think
jame
sledd
deed
are
gon
na
make
much
of
a
differ
ulitm
ya
know
but
they
will
have
alreadi
have
made
a
differ
great
or
small
befor
the
end
whi
must
your
end
be
etern
to
be
worthwhil
most
peopl
are
abl
to
live
with
that
and
for
them
littl
purpos
success
money
power
effect
chang
help
other
suffic
littl
is
in
the
eye
of
the
behold
of
cours
i
suppos
they
never
think
about
the
cosmic
scale
or
are
at
least
abl
to
put
it
out
of
their
mind
i
dont
doubt
it
but
i
have
thought
about
the
cosmic
scale
and
it
doe
not
seem
to
mean
much
to
u
here
today
to
me
it
is
comfort
to
know
that
realiti
is
an
illus
i
would
not
find
thi
comfort
but
perhap
it
is
mere
my
definit
here
what
i
think
the
relev
term
are
realiti
that
which
is
real
illus
that
which
is
not
real
but
seem
to
be
real
object
exist
for
realiti
to
be
an
illus
would
mean
then
that
which
is
real
is
not
real
but
seem
to
be
or
that
which
object
exist
doe
not
object
exist
but
doe
seem
to
object
exist
from
which
we
can
conclud
that
unless
you
want
to
get
a
contradict
that
no
thing
object
exist
but
i
have
a
problem
with
thi
becaus
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
object
exist
if
noth
els
cogito
ergo
sum
and
all
that
perhap
you
do
not
mean
all
that
but
rather
mean
object
realiti
is
unreach
by
human
which
is
not
so
bad
and
so
far
a
i
know
is
true
that
the
true
realiti
underneath
the
the
physic
is
spirit
have
on
if
realiti
is
an
illus
isnt
true
realiti
an
illus
too
and
if
true
realiti
is
spirit
doenst
that
make
spirit
an
illus
a
well
if
i
am
not
distinctli
confus
thi
is
get
posit
buddhist
that
thi
world
is
a
school
of
sort
where
we
learn
and
grow
and
our
soul
matur
that
is
one
hell
of
a
statement
although
perhap
true
do
you
mean
to
impli
that
it
wa
intend
to
be
so
if
so
pleas
show
that
thi
is
true
if
not
pleas
explain
how
thi
can
give
a
purpos
to
anyth
that
give
a
purpos
to
my
littl
purpos
how
doe
it
do
that
wouldnt
the
worldschool
w
intent
idea
make
the
world
a
prepar
for
some
greater
purpos
rather
than
a
purpos
in
itself
and
take
some
of
the
pressur
off
what
pressur
it
not
so
necessari
to
make
thi
life
a
success
in
human
term
if
your
realli
just
here
to
learn
it
is
not
necessari
to
be
a
success
in
human
term
unless
your
goal
either
includ
do
so
or
requir
do
so
befor
they
themselv
can
be
achiv
inde
mani
peopl
have
set
goal
for
themselv
that
do
not
includ
success
in
human
term
a
i
understand
it
check
out
yer
buddhist
monk
type
guy
out
for
nirvana
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
it
more
import
to
progress
grow
persist
to
learn
to
love
yourself
and
other
and
to
express
your
love
especi
when
it
dificult
to
do
so
honest
effort
is
reward
by
god
he
know
our
limit
whi
is
learn
to
love
a
goal
what
happen
if
you
fail
in
thi
goal
to
you
to
god
to
the
mysteri
purpos
deletia
question
about
immortailti
and
my
answer
delet
becaus
it
wa
mostli
quot
two
seriou
questionsinvit
to
discuss
what
is
the
natur
of
etern
life
how
can
we
a
mortal
lock
into
space
time
conceiv
of
it
possibl
answer
for
the
best
we
can
do
is
metaphoranalog
question
a
what
is
the
best
metaphor
ill
have
a
crack
at
that
the
natur
of
etern
life
is
neatli
describ
by
it
name
it
is
the
concept
of
life
without
death
life
without
end
no
we
can
put
togeth
word
to
describ
it
but
we
can
not
imagin
it
a
no
metaphor
is
adequ
next
to
etern
if
it
were
we
could
not
understand
it
either
or
so
i
suspect
dan
johnson
and
god
said
jeez
thi
is
dull
and
it
wa
dull
genesi
these
opinion
probabl
show
what
i
know
