strictli
a
they
were
rais
in
their
norwegian
lutheran
commun
they
felt
that
we
would
be
alien
from
them
and
it
would
creat
problem
in
other
word
my
parent
did
the
veri
toler
love
thing
they
rais
u
without
conflict
without
what
we
saw
a
unreason
demand
and
were
alway

that
i
grew
up
believ
in

ethic
and
never
absolut
i
believ
in
a
love

and
my
concept
of

wa
there
ani
concept
that
i

that
the
world
told
me

veri
good
honest
and
moral
peopl
they

four
extrem
honest
child
yet
befor
come
to
a
more
complet
knowledg
of
god
which
includ
the
knowledg
of
justic
and

commit
what
i
now
believ
to

mani
mani
grave
sin
i
live
with
a

and
more
my

by
not

their
standard
on
u
and
by
accept
unquestioningli
everyth
we
did
without
judgement
or
counsel
today
it
is
absolut
appal
for
me
to
look
back
on
what
they
did
accept
without
a
word
it
take
courag
to
dare
to
help
soul
becaus
you
must
speak
up
and
say
what
is
unpopular
and
difficult
and
what
peopl
do
not
want
to
hear
you
must
be
abl
to
say
what
is
hard
and
say
it
a
christ
would
with
love
and
compass
it
involv
riskperhap
someon
you
love
may
not
want
to
hear
and
will
stay
away
from
you
thi
life
is
but
dust
a
long
a
the
comfort
of
thi
life
is
our
highest
prioriti
we
will
fail
god
and
fail
those
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
i
wonder
how
mani
who
engag
in
sex
outsid
of
marriag
who
support
the
right
to
abort
who
engag
in
homosexu
or
who
commit
ani
of
the
rang
of
sin
that
are
plenti
in
thi
time
have
ever
heard
from
a
quiet
thought
love
friend
that
these
thing
are
wrong
no
one
ever
told
me
that
what
i
wa
do
wa
wrong
and
i
saw
multitud
around
me
live
the
same
way
i
wa
and
they
seem
like
good
decent
peopl
wouldnt
kick
dog
or
beat
the
elderli
or
babi
it
is
more
difficult
for
sinner
without
a
genuin
prayer
life
to
hear
the
holi
spirit
than
it
is
to
hear
a
love
friend
think
about
thi
the
next
time
the
holi
spirit
tell
you
that
a
friend
is
in
error
but
you
dont
want
to
caus
troubl
righteou
prayer
is
great
power
but
dont
forget
that
we
are
we
are
christ
lip
and
hand
on
earth
dont
be
afraid
to
simpli
voic
truth
when
the
situat
call
for
it
say
a
fervent
prayer
and
ask
the
holi
spirit
for
love
and
guidanc
in
more
way
