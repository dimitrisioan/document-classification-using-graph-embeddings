i
have
seen
two
common
thread
run
through
post
by
atheist
on
the
newsgroup
and
i
think
that
they
can
be
use
to
explain
each
other
unfortun
i
dont
have
direct
quot
handi
atheist
believ
that
when
they
die
they
die
forev
a
god
who
would
condemn
those
who
fail
to
believ
in
him
to
etern
death
is
unfair
i
dont
see
what
the
problem
is
to
christian
hell
is
by
definit
etern
deathexactli
what
atheist
are
expect
when
they
die
thi
is
the
problem
thi
is
not
hell
thi
is
perman
death
it
is
inde
what
atheist
gener
expect
and
it
is
neither
fair
nor
unfair
it
just
is
you
might
a
well
argu
about
whether
be
made
mostli
of
carbon
and
water
is
fair
howev
the
atheist
who
claim
that

talk
about
the

and
brimston
place
of
endless
suffer
which

dunno
but
some
sort
of
continu
not
at
all
the
same
thing
grant
you
clearli
feel
that
helldeath
but
thi
is
not
a
univer
sentiment
a
near
a
i
can
tell
if
your
idea
of
god
condemn
heathen
to
ordinari
death
i
have
no
problem
with
that
i
do
have
a
problem
with
the
god
that
