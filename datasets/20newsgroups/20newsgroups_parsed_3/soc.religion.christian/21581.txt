my
stuff
about
deal
with
deffer
delet
thi
is
not
at
all
compar
christian
is
the
main
stream
in
western
cultur
you
are
trivial
the
experi
of
other
i
am
sorri
i
did
not
mean
to
i
think
i
understand
how
your
experi
were
much
wors
than
the
small
bit
of
ridicul
i
have
had
to
put
up
with
i
guess
i
didnt
realli
understand
befor
now
i
do
i
rememb
what
it
wa
like
be
differ
a
a
christian
we
were
told
all
the
time
that
we
were
differ
and
in
fact
that
onli
member
of
the
our
church
were
realli
christian
though
other
who
believ
in
god
werent
a
bad
a
atheist
so
we
were
a
small
minor
that
wa
noth
compar
to
be
an
atheist
wow
pretti
conserv
church
plea
excus
me
if
thi
seem
like
a
ridicul
understat
to
you
the
onli
thing
compar
would
be
a
young
child
be
christian
be
surround
by
staunch
atheist
includ
parent
who
activ
persecut
ani
religi
tendanc
both
actual
punish
and
even
wors
emot
blackmail
they
would
also
have
to
have
the
whole
mainstream
societi
on
their
side
mayb
these
condit
could
have
occur
in
the
old
soviet
union
not
in
a
countri
with
under
god
in
it
pledg
of
allegi
on
a
side
note
that
under
god
wasnt
in
there
until
recent
i
believ
my
father
who
is
in
hi
sixti
rememb
say
the
pledg
of
allegi
without
that
in
there
i
dont
know
the
histori
behind
that
though
emot
blackmail
ouch
thank
good
ill
be
neutral
in
my
thank
here
i
wa
rais
in
a
complet
toler
household
so
that
i
could
make
my
own
decis
i
doubt
it
even
then
becaus
child
have
to
be
taught
to
be
christian
and
henc
must
have
support
somewher
so
atheism
doesnt
have
to
be
taught
but
christian
doe
i
guess
i
can
see
that
although
i
can
see
a
child
believ
in
some
sort
of
god
without
anyth
other
than
hi
her
own
imagin
a
a
basi
sorri
i
guess
thi
is
sort
of
minor
my
queri
about
parallel
between
lack
of
choic
for
homosexu
and
lack
of
choic
for
him
a
an
atheist
delet
ye
my
atheism
wa
born
of
necess
for
an
intellectu
honest
person
belief
is
mostli
a
respons
to
evid
hmm
i
wonder
whi
i
am
a
christian
then
thi
isnt
a
flame
thi
is
a
real
wonder
doe
anyon
el
have
opinion
to
offer
on
whi
you
believ
in
someth
that
hasnt
necessarili
been
proven
to
you
will
or
wish
have
noth
to
do
with
it
i
could
choos
to
lie
or
to
be
silent
about
my
true
belief
i
could
no
more
choos
to
believ
in
the
god
of
christian
than
i
could
decid
that
the
ordinari
sky
look
red
to
me
sound
like
you
are
an
atheist
by
natur
then
or
is
it
possibl
that
at
least
part
of
it
is
due
to
the
appar
repress
natur
of
the
christian
of
your
childhood
if
thi
is
get
too
person
perhap
you
should
ignor
it
or
we
can
take
it
to
email
still
i
should
be
clear
that
im
not
equat
what
i
went
through
with
what
gay
go
through
howev
it
is
a
mistak
to
assum
that
everyon
who
goe
through
pain
experi
are
broken
by
them
happili
some
are
made
stronger
onc
we
get
past
it
thi
may
have
been
a
gener
remark
you
do
not
sound
broken
to
me
but
inde
stronger
i
must
say
that
i
wasnt
hurt
by
my
experi
in
church
ani
more
than
some
of
my
friend
who
didnt
becom
atheist
i
wa
just
hurt
differ
im
not
sure
i
understand
thi
sentenc
could
you
explain
not
without
go
to
detail
and
violat
the
confid
of
some
of
my
childhood
friend
suffic
it
say
to
that
religion
doe
not
guarante
that
a
person
will
be
happi
and
strong
emot
and
a
