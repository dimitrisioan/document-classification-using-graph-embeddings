re
certainti
and
arrog
in
an
earlier
articl
i
explain
that
what
mani
peopl
find
arrog
about
christian
is
that
some
christian
profess
absolut
certianti
about
their
belief
and
doctrin
that
is
mani
christian
insist
that
they
can
not
have
made
ani
mistak
when
discov
their
belief
which
amount
to
say
that
they
are
infal
impicitli
claim
to
be
infal
is
pretti
arrog
most
of
u
will
probabl
agre
in
short
the
problem
is
that
no
matter
how
good
your
sourc
are
if
ani
part
of
your
doctrin
or
belief
rest
on
your
own
think
and
reason
then
those
doctrin
are
suspect
so
long
a
your
own
brain
is
involv
there
is
a
possibl
for
error
i
summaris
the
problem
by
write
there
is
no
way
out
of
the
loop
someon
call
rexlex
ha
claim
that
there
is
a
way
out
of
the
loop
but
he
did
not
bother
to
explain
what
it
wa
prefer
instead
to
paraphras
sartr
rambl
about
wittgenstein
and
say
that
the
conclus
of
my
argument
lead
to
relativ
a
i
have
explain
to
him
befor
you
can
not
reject
an
argument
a
fals
becaus
you
dislik
where
it
lead
the
fact
do
not
chang
just
becaus
you
dislik
them
rexlex
wrote
i
disagre
with
dr
nanci
sweeti
conclus
becaus
if
it
is
taken
to
fruition
it
lead
to
relativ
which
lead
to
dispair
howev
a
ani
firstyear
philosophi
student
can
explain
what
rexlex
ha
written
doe
not
constitut
a
refut
all
he
ha
said
is
that
he
doe
not
like
what
i
wrote
he
ha
done
noth
at
all
to
disput
it
there
were
two
sentenc
in
rexlex
post
that
seem
relev
to
the
point
at
hand
there
is
such
a
thing
a
true
truth
and
it
is
real
it
can
be
experienc
and
it
is
verifi
i
do
not
disput
that
some
truth
can
be
verifi
through
experi
i
have
for
exampl
direct
experi
of
ad
number
i
dont
claim
to
be
infal
at
it
in
fact
i
rememb
do
sum
incorrectli
but
i
do
claim
that
i
have
direct
experi
of
reason
about
number
howev
onc
we
go
past
experienc
thing
and
start
reason
about
them
we
are
on
much
shakier
ground
that
wa
the
point
of
the
earlier
articl
human
brain
are
infest
with
sin
and
they
can
onli
be
trust
in
veri
limit
circumst
it
is
onli
becaus
of
god
own
revel
that
we
can
be
absolut
about
a
thing
but
how
far
doe
that
get
you
onc
god
revel
stop
and
your
own
reason
begin
possibl
for
error
appear
for
exampl
let
suppos
that
our
modern
bibl
translat
includ
a
perfect
render
of
jesu
word
at
the
last
supper
and
that
jesu
said
exactli
thi
is
my
bodi
well
presum
that
what
he
said
wa
total
without
error
and
absolut
true
what
can
we
be
certain
of
not
much
at
the
moment
he
stop
speak
and
peopl
start
interpret
the
possibl
of
error
appear
did
he
mean
that
liter
or
not
we
do
not
have
ani
record
that
he
elabor
on
the
word
wa
he
think
of
tran
or
con
substati
he
didnt
say
we
interpret
thi
passag
use
our
brain
we
think
and
reason
and
draw
conclus
but
we
know
that
our
brain
are
not
perfect
our
think
often
lead
u
wrong
thi
is
someth
that
most
of
u
have
direct
experi
of
whi
should
anyon
believ
that
hi
reason
which
he
know
to
be
fallibl
can
lead
him
to
perfect
conclus
so
given
the
assumpt
in
thi
exampl
what
we
can
be
certain
of
is
that
jesu
said
thi
is
my
bodi
beyond
that
onc
we
start
make
up
doctrin
and
use
our
brain
to
reason
about
what
christ
reveal
we
get
into
troubl
unless
you
are
infal
there
are
veri
few
thing
you
can
be
certain
of
to
the
extent
that
doctrin
reli
on
fallibl
human
think
they
can
not
be
certain
that
is
the
problem
of
seem
arrog
the
nonchristian
around
u
know
that
human
be
make
mistak
just
a
sure
a
we
know
it
they
do
not
believ
we
are
infal
ani
more
than
we
do
when
christian
speak
a
if
they
believ
their
own
reason
can
never
lead
them
astray
when
we
implicitli
claim
that
we
are
infal
the
non
christian
around
u
rare
believ
that
implicit
claim
wit
is
hardli
go
to
work
when
the
person
you
are
talk
to
believ
that
you
are
either
too
foolish
to
recognis
your
own
limit
or
intent
tri
to
cover
them
up
i
think
it
would
be
far
better
to
say
what
thing
we
are
certain
of
and
what
thing
we
are
onli
veri
confid
of
for
exampl
we
might
say
that
we
know
our
sin
for
recognis
sin
is
someth
we
directli
experi
but
other
thing
whether
base
on
reason
from
scriptur
or
extrabibl
think
should
not
be
labl
a
infal
we
should
say
that
we
are
veri
confid
of
them
and
be
readi
to
explain
our
reason
but
so
far
a
i
am
awar
none
of
u
is
