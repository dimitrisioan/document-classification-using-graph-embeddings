of

man
well
know
to

to
say
that
they
didnt
know
where
he
wa
buri
beg
the
question
here
again
the
problem
with
most
of
the
individu
post
here
you
take
the
biblic
account
a
though
it
were
some
sort
of
histor
recount
in
the
modern
sens
i
would
refer
you
to
john
domin
crossan
book
the
cross
that
spoke
pub
harper
and
row
the
earliest
text
which
we
have
make
no
refer
to
an
empti
tomb
nor
is
an
empti
tomb
necessari
for
a
claim
of
resurrect
modern
evangelicalsfundamentalist
have
complet
miss
what
the
point
of
resurrect
is
here
the
work
of
georg
nickelsburg
work
resurrect
immort
and
etern
life
in
intertestament
judaism
publ
cambridg
havard
univ
press
is
most
help
look
at
rom
paul
here
ha
no
need
of
an
empti
tomb
addit
in
cor
here
again
there
is
no
mention
of
an
empti
tomb
he
wa
rais
note
the
passiv
he
appear
no
ascens
either
resurrect
could
be
accomplish
without
ever
disturb
the
bone
in
the
grave
the
whole
idea
of
an
empti
tomb
isnt
broach
in
ani
of
our
text
until
well
after
the
fall
of
jerusalem
by
that
time
the
idea
of
come
up
with
a
bodi
would
have
been
ludicri
moreov
mack
ha
argu
convicingli
i
think
that
the
empti
tomb
stori
first
appear
in
mark
we
have
no
text
befor
thi
which
mention
the
tomb
now
you
say
that
you
think
that
the
discipl
stole
the
bodi
but
think
on
thi
a
moment
would
you
die
to
maintain
someth
you
knew
to
be
a
deliber
lie
if
not
then
whi
do
you
think
the
discipl
would
now
im
not
talk
about
die
for
someth
you
firmli
believ
to
be
the
truth
but
unbeknown
to
you
it
is
a
lie
mani
have
done
thi
no
im
talk
about
die
by
behead
stone
crucifixion
etc
for
someth
you
know
to
be
a
lie
thu
you
posit
with
regard
to
the
discipl
steal
the
bodi
seem
rather
lightweight
to
me
a
for
graverobb
whi
risk
the
sever
penalti
for
grave
rob
over
the
bodi
of
jesu
he
wasnt
buri
with
great
rich
so
again
thi
is
an
argument
that
can
be
discount
that
leaf
you
back
on
squar
one
what
happen
to
the
bodi
again
let
me
comment
that
the
most
plausibl
nonchristian
scenario
and
the
one
typic
suggest
by
sceptic
who
are
knowledg
about
the
nt
is
that
the
resurrect
wa
a
subject
event
and
the
empti
tomb
stori
are
a
result
of
account
grow
in
the
tell
clh
you
are
quit
right
here
even
the
idea
of
a
subject
mystic
event
a
