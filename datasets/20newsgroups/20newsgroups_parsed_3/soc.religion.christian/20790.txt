re
serbian
genocid
work
of
god
d
andrew
kill
write
are
you
suggest
that
god
support
genocid
perhap
the
german
were
punish
jew
on
god
behalf
ani
god
who
work
that
way
is
indescrib
evil
and
unworthi
of
my
worship
or
faith
the
bibl
doe
tell
u
that
govern
are
ordain
by
god
roman
and
furthermor
god
foreknow
everyth
that
would
happen
it
is
just
to
difficult
for
human
to
grap
with
our
limit
mind
the
inevitabl
of
the
sucess
of
god
plan
and
thi
is
especi
hard
to
grasp
when
we
see
governemnt
do
evil
howev
though
they
are
do
evil
and
we
should
not
cooper
with
them
when
they
do
such
it
must
be
understood
that
what
happen
is
what
god
want
so
a
to
lead
to
the
final
sucess
of
hi
plan
to
save
a
mani
soul
from
hell
a
is
possibl
in
short
the
slaughter
in
bosnia
though
deplor
in
the
eye
of
god
mayb
then
again
they
might
be
get
their
just
desert
now
rather
than
later
there
are
plenti
of
exampl
of
god
kill
peopl
for
their
sin
onan
in
the
old
testmament
for
exampl
and
annia
and
spahira
in
the
new
is
what
he
will
to
happen
so
that
hi
plan
might
be
accomplish
but
dont
forget
it
is
not
unbibl
for
god
to
use
one
nation
to
execut
hi
just
judgement
upon
anoth
the
roman
were
use
to
fulfil
the
choru
of
let
hi
blood
be
upon
our
hand
of
the
crowd
in
