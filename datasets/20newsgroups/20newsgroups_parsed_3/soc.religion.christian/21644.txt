stephen
mcintyr
write
i
would
rather
spend
an
etern
in
hell
than
be
besid
god
in
heaven
know
that
even
one
man
would
spend
hi
etern
life
be
scorch
for
hi
wrongdo
stephen
i
suspect
that
when
you
and
i
use
the
word
hell
we
have
differ
concept
in
mind
when
you
encount
refer
to
heaven
in
term
of
crown
and
harp
and
golden
street
i
trust
that
you
do
not
suppos
or
suspect
christian
of
suppos
that
the
golden
street
are
to
be
taken
liter
still
le
that
they
are
what
the
concept
of
heaven
is
all
about
whi
then
should
you
suppos
that
about
the
fire
of
hell
have
you
read
the
novel
atla
shrug
do
you
rememb
the
last
descript
of
jame
taggart
sit
on
the
floor
besid
the
ferri
persuad
thi
come
close
to
a
descript
of
what
is
meant
by
hell
in
my
circl
if
the
imag
of
fire
is
often
use
in
thi
connect
there
are
two
reason
that
occur
to
me
the
first
reason
is
that
it
convey
the
idea
of
hell
a
someth
that
ani
ration
be
would
earnestli
wish
to
avoid
a
ani
ration
be
would
wish
to
avoid
the
fate
of
jame
taggart
but
the
latter
imag
is
meaning
onli
to
those
who
have
read
atla
shrug
a
smaller
audienc
than
those
who
have
play
with
match
the
second
reason
is
the
histori
of
the
hebrew
word
gehenna
one
of
the
word
translat
hell
in
the
new
testament
it
refer
to
the
valley
of
hinnon
outsid
jerusalem
in
earli
day
it
wa
a
place
where
the
canaanit
offer
human
sacrific
burn
aliv
to
molech
later
it
wa
made
a
garbag
or
refus
dump
where
fire
burn
continu
consum
the
trash
of
the
citi
of
jerusalem
to
be
cast
into
gehenna
or
to
burn
in
gehenna
thu
becam
a
metaphor
for
to
be
reject
or
discard
a
worthless
lest
you
think
that
identifi
hell
with
the
fate
of
jame
taggart
is
my
own
privat
fanci
i
commend
to
you
the
book
the
great
divorc
by
c
s
lewi
it
discus
heaven
no
harp
and
hell
no
flame
it
is
shorter
than
atla
shrug
and
avail
