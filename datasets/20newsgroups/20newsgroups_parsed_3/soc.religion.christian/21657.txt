in
the
histori
of

at
a
colleg
here
in
st

the
teacher
of

is
what
i
consid
to
be
closedmind

bigot
on
the
subject
of
what
the
definit
of

is
hi
definit
is
tie
directli
to
that
of
the
triniti
and
the
cathol
church
definit
of
it
and
belief
in
jesu
christ
is
not
suffici
to
call
one
self
a
christian
what
you
call
the
triniti
and
the
cathol
church
definit
of
it
is
precis
the
result
of
the
first
christian
get
togeth
and
tri
to
find
an
accept
answer
to
your
question
what
is
a
christian
i
cant
see
what
you
are
object
to
someon
is
say
what
historian
of
all
belief
would
agre
on
and
you
are
call
him
a
closedmind
bigot
you
realli
ought
to
say
what
you
mean
by
belief
in
jesu
christ
it
is
not
a
word
that
is
suffici
to
describ
a
christian
muslim
believ
in
jesu
christ
although
they
believ
he
wa
a
prophet
and
not
the
incarn
son
of
god
but
follow
of
eastern
religion
might
be
quit
happi
to
say
that
jesu
wa
the
incarn
of
god
along
with
larg
number
of
other
histor
and
mythic
figur
so
perhap
you
ought
to
rephras
your
question
and
say
precis
what
it
is
in
the
tradit
definit
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
christian
a
hand
down
by
the
univers
church
you
object
to
but
regard
a
unnecessari
for
be
a
christian
