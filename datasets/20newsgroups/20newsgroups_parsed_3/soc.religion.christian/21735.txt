when
elizabeth
greet
mari
elizabeth
said
someth
to
the
effect
that
mari
out
of
all
woman
wa
bless
if
so
it
appear
that
thi
exactli
place
mari
beyond
the
sanctif
of
normal
human
i
dont
see
how
thi
logic
follow
true
enough
mari
receiv
a
bless
beyond
ani
grant
in
all
the
histori
of
human
by
be
privileg
to
be
the
mother
of
the
savior
it
say
noth
about
mari
need
to
be
a
bless
person
first
in
order
that
she
might
therebi
be
worthi
to
bear
the
son
of
god
again
i
think
the
problem
is
that
a
human
we
cant
comprehend
how
the
sinless
incarn
could
spring
from
sin
human
flesh
and
god
spirit
rather
than
simpli
accept
the
graciou
miracl
of
god
we
must
need
tri
to
dope
out
a
mechan
or
rational
a
to
how
thi
could
be
mari
own
word
my
spirit
rejoic
in
god
my
savior
for
he
ha
regard
the
low
estat
of
hi
handmaiden
sound
like
the
word
of
a
human
awar
of
her
own
human
in
need
of
a
savior
similar
to
what
david
proclaim
in
hi

the

no
further
need

just
that
i
see
mari
and
joseph
and

reduc
to

i
feel
we
lose
the
wonder
in
the
fact
that
god
chose
to
come
down
to
you
and
i
to
be
born
of
peopl
like
you
