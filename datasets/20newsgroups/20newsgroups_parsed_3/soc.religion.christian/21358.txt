write
one
thing
i
dont
understand
is
whi
be
sacr
should
make
the
templ
ritual
secret
on
of
the
attribut
of
be
sacr
in
thi
case
is
that
they
should
not
be
spoken
of
in
a
common
manner
or
trampl
under
foot
such
a
the
lord
name
is
today
the
ceremoni
are
perform
in
the
templ
becaus
the
templ
ha
been
set
asid
a
be
a
sacredholyuncommon
place
we
believ
that
the
ceremoni
can
onli
be
interpret
correctli
when
they
are
view
with
the
right
spirit
which
in
thi
case
is
in
the
templ
so
from
our
point
of
view
when
they
are
brought
out
into
the
public
they
are
be
trampl
under
foot
becaus
of
misinterpret
and
mock
and
it
is
therefor
offens
to
u
plea
do
not
assum
that
becaus
of
my
use
of
the
word
we
and
our
that
im
an

what
i
believ
is
