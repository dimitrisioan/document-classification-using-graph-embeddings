re
be
right
about
messiah
in
articl
desire
bradley
write
i
must
have
miss
the
post
about
waco
david
koresh
and
the
second
come
how
doe
one
tell
if
a
second
come
is
the
real
thing
unless
the
person
claim
to
be
it
is
obvious
insan
one
rule
of
thumb
is
that
if
a
person
is
make
the
claim
they
are
wrong
i
wa
just
read
john
thi
morn
i
think
that
is
the
right
chapter
anyway
it
is
close
and
i
dont
have
a
bibl
at
work
to
check
with
and
in
it
jesu
is
talk
to
hi
discipl
about
hi
impend
death
and
he
say
that
he
will
be
go
away
and
then
later
he
will
be
with
them
he
said
someth
along
the
line
of
i
will
be
in
you
and
you
will
be
in
me
again
i
can
not
provid
the
exact
quot
or
citat
anyway
my
understand
of
thi
is
that
the
second
come
will
not
be
an
outward
event
it
is
an
inward
event
christ
will
come
to
live
in
our
heart
and
we
will
live
in
him
if
you
look
for
a
person
you
will
be
deceiv
it
seem
to
me
that
the
jew
had
been
look
for
a
messiah
that
would
be
a
polit
or
militari
leader
and
so
didnt
recogn
jesu
when
he
came
jesu
tri
to
show
that
hi
kingdom
wa
not
of
thi
earth
a
lot
of
what
i
have
seen
written
about
the
second
come
seem
to
base
on
an
expect
of
christ
come
back
and
final
take
over
the
world
and
run
it
the
way
it
should
be
it
sound
a
lot
like
what
the
jew
were
look
for
the
first
come
wasnt
like
that
and
i
see
no
reason
for
the
second
come
to
be
like
that
either
oh
and
by
the
way
i
dont
expect
it
to
happen
onc
there
is
no
one
second
come
there
are
a
lot
of
littl
one
everi
time
christ
come
into
someon
heart
christ
ha
come
again
peac
will

chang
without
notic
when
all
your
dream
are
laid
to
rest
you
can
get
what
second
best
but
it
hard
to
get
enough
