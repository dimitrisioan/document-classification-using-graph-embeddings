to
the

that
mean
other
than
the

penalti
and
militari
oper
are
suffici
to
keep

then
these
nonviol

are
to
be
prefer
becaus
they
are
more

thank
for
post
the
exact
word
which
i
had
not
seen
previous
the
part
i
quot
abov
seem
to
me
to
indic
disapprov
of
capit
punish
it
is
to
be
use
onli
when
other
mean
are
not
suffici
i
would
say
thi
is
a
stronger
restrict
than
say
that
capit
punish
is
useabl
when
justifi
i
would
certainli
say
there
are
case
where
a

justifi
death
perhap
thi
is
the
old

my
rever
for
life
would
say
that
i
would
oppos
the
actual
inflict
of
the
death
penalti
a
new
testament
interpret
it
is
a
matter
for
debat
whether
the
death
penalti
work
to
keep
the
peac
in
a
way
that
nonviol
provis
do
not
i
dont
believ
it
doe
and
i
would
certainli
observ
that
in
the
usa
where
you
have
the
death
penalti
there
is
a
far
higher
murder
rate
than
