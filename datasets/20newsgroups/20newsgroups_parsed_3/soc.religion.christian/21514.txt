subject
definit
of
christian
i
have
enrol
in
the
histori
of
christian
at
a
colleg
here
in
st
loui
the
teacher
of
the
class
is
what
i
consid
to
be
closedmind
and
bigot
on
the
subject
of
what
the
definit
of
christian
is
hi
definit
is
tie
directli
to
that
of
the
triniti
and
the
cathol
church
definit
of
it
and
belief
in
jesu
christ
is
not
suffici
to
call
one
self
a
christian
while
hi
say
it
doesnt
make
it
so
i
nevertheless
feel
insult
or
am
i
just
neurot
i
would
like
to
be
abl
to
respond
to
him
with
some
sen
of
literaci
while
maintain
an
amiabl
studentteach
relationship
so
is
there
common
definit
of
what
christian
is
a
the
previou
discus
of
the
triniti
did
not
lend
itself
to
an
exchang
of
flame
i
am
hope
that
thi
will
also
not
produc
major
flame

st
loui
often
we
get
into
discus
about
who
is
christian
unfortun
there
are
a
number
of
possibl
definit
start
from
the
broadest
commonli
use
definit
are
a
histor
definit
peopl
who
accept
christ
a
lord
and
savior
a
broad
doctrin
definit
narrow
doctrin
definit
by
a
histor
definit
i
mean
the
sort
of
definit
a
secular
historian
would
like
use
thi
would
includ
ani
group
that
develop
out
of
the
christian
church
and
continu
within
the
same
broad
cultur
eg
some
unitarian
would
fail
just
about
ani
doctrin
test
you
could
come
up
with
yet
it
clear
that
that
group
develop
from
christian
and
peopl
from
veri
differ
background
eg
hindu
would
like
see
them
a
part
of
christian
thi
is
not
a
definit
most
christian
like
but
it
relev
in
some
polit
and
ethnic
context
accept
christ
a
lord
and
savior
is
a
test
use
by
mani
christian
group
for
membership
eg
the
southern
baptist
and
presbyterian
church
usa
i
would
qualifi
it
by
say
that
what
most
peopl
have
in
mind
is
an
exclus
commit
to
christ
so
that
someon
who
accept
christ
a
one
of
mani
god
would
not
fit
it
an
attempt
to
formul
a
criterion
that
is
religi
but
is
not
base
on
technic
doctrin
by
thi
definit
group
such
a
arian
would
be
view
a
heret
christian
but
still
christian
in
the
modern
context
thi
would
includ
mormon
jw
and
one
pentecost
they
would
be
view
a
heret
christian
but
still
christian
in
practic
i
believ
just
about
everyon
who
fall
into
thi
categori
would
accept
the
apostl
creed
the
next
level
is
an
attempt
to
give
a
broad
doctrin
definit
which
includ
all
of
the
major
strand
of
christian
but
exclud
group
that
are
felt
to
be
outsid
histor
christian
thi
is
of
cours
a
slipperi
enterpris
sinc
cathol
could
argu
that
protest
are
outsid
histor
christian
etc
but
i
think
the
most
commonli
accept
definit
would
be
base
on
someth
like
the
nicen
creed
and
the
formula
of
chalcedon
the
attempt
is
to
character
doctrin
that
all
major
strand
of
christian
agre
are
key
obvious
thi
is
to
some
extent
a
matter
of
judgement
a
mormon
will
regard
the
ld
church
a
a
major
strand
and
thu
will
not
want
to
includ
anyth
that
contradict
their
belief
but
i
think
thi
definit
would
have
fairli
broad
accept
final
some
peopl
use
definit
that
i
would
say
are
limit
to
a
specif
christian
tradit
eg
some
evangel
onli
consid
someon
christian
if
he
ha
had
an
evangelicalstyl
convers
experi
and
some
ive
even
heard
of
group
that
limit
it
to
their
specif
church
i
think
you
can
find
context
where
each
of
these
definit
is
use
a
lot
is
go
to
depend
upon
the
purpos
your
use
it
for
if
your
use
it
descript
eg
in
histori
or
anthropolog
youll
probabl
use
definit
or
if
your
use
it
norm
ie
to
say
what
you
believ
the
christian
messag
is
youll
probabl
use
a
definit
like
or
even
clh
