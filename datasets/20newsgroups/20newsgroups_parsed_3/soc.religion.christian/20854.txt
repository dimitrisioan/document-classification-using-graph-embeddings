re
sabbath
admiss
of
all
of
the
argument
concern
the
sabbath
ought
to
make
the
point
pretti
clear
anyon
outsid
of
the
cathol
or
orthodox
oranglican
or
monophysit
church
ourght
to
worship
on
saturday
if
they
are
realli
sola
scriptura
otherwis
they
are
follow
a
law
put
into
effect
by
the
church
and
onli
the
abov
chruch
realli
recogn
ani
power
of
the
chruch
to
do
so
andi
byler
you
will
note
that
noth
in
the
faq
said
anyth
about
the
church
establish
or
chang
a
law
the
argument
against
the
sabbath
is
that
it
is
part
of
the
ceremoni
law
and
like
the
rest
of
the
ceremoni
law
is
not
bind
on
christian
thi
argument
is
base
on
paul
letter
act
and
in
a
more
gener
sens
jesu
teach
further
most
peopl
argu
that
scriptur
show
worship
occur
on
sunday
and
paul
endors
it
i
understand
that
these
point
are
disput
and
do
not
want
to
go
around
the
disput
one
more
time
the
point
im
make
here
is
not
that
these
argument
are
right
but
that
the
back
they
claim
is
scriptur
accept
the
principl
of
sola
scriptura
doe
not
commit
u
to
obey
the
entir
jewish
law
act
and
paul
letter
are
quit
clear
on
that
i
think
even
the
sda
accept
it
the
disagr
is
on
where
the
bibl
would
have
u
place
the
line
by
the
way
protest
do
give
author
to
the
church
in
matter
that
are
not
dictat
by
god
that
whi
church
are
free
to
determin
their
own
liturgi
church
politi
etc
if
you
accept
that
the
sabbath
is
not
bind
on
christian
then
the
day
of
worship
fall
into
the
categori
of
