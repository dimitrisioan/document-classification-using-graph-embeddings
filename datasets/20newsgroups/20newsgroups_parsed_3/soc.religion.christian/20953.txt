write
hello
i
have
seen
two
common
thread
run
through
post
by
atheist
on
the
newsgroup
and
i
think
that
they
can
be
use
to
explain
each
other
unfortun
i
dont
have
direct
quot
handi
atheist
believ
that
when
they
die
they
die
forev
more
correctli
when
peopl
die
they
ceas
to
exist
a
god
who
would
condemn
those
who
fail
to
believ
in
him
to
etern
death
is
unfair
i
dont
see
what
the
problem
is
to
christian
hell
is
by
definit
etern
deathexactli
what
atheist
are
expect
when
they
die
the
idea
ive
gotten
is
that
to
christian
hell
is
like
heaven
afterlif
ie
you
dont
ceas
to
exist
but
are
subject
to
etern
tortur
well
that
the
orthodox
idea
anyway
etern
death
if
you
prefer
that
atheist
dont
believ
in
ani
sort
of
afterlif
liter
interpret
of
the
bibl
will
have
a
problem
with
thi
view
sinc
the
bibl
talk
about
the
fire
of
hell
and
such
person
i
dont
think
that
peopl
in
hell
will
be
thrust
into
flame
ani
more
than
i
expect
to
jesu
with
a
doubleedg
sword
issu
from
hi
mouthi
treat
both
these
state
ment
a
metaphor
i
think
it
safe
to
say
that
hell
wa
never
intend
metaphor
certainli
not
the
equival
of
ceas
to
exist
some
christian
concept
are
inde
metaphor
but
your
idea
of
hell
is
a
th
centuri
interpret
it
is
of
cours
nice
to
see
that
even
christian
might
evolv
to
fit
the
worldview
of
modern
age
but
i
fear
the
church
will
not
accept
it
understand
per
hap
becaus
if
you
accept
that
hell
is
a
metaphor
then
your
one
step
closer
to
turn
god
into
a
metaphor
