slaveri
place
on
the

of
africanamerican
thi
wa
most
effect
done
by
the
display
of
white
icon
of
jesu
in
slave
church
to
encourag
the
godli
superior
of
slaveown
it
wasnt
enough
that
the
slaveown
wa
your
provid
but
he
wa
also
your
god
to
be
look
upon
with
uncondit
love
loyalti
and
to

but
what
about
biblic
physic
descript
of
jesu
hi
hair
be
compar
to
that
of
wool
hi
foot
to
that
of
brass
and
think
about
the
area
of

took
place
i
welcom
all

i
expect
at
least
thi

it
doesnt
matter
what

wa
hi
action
what
he
did
for
mankind
are
what

thi
but
he
walk
the
earth
for
decad
a
a
human
thi
part
of
hi
exist
intrigu
me
and
a
for
say
that
it
doesnt
matter
to
a
member
of
a
physic
emancip
peopl
who
is
still
struggl
for
mental
emancip
believ
me
it
matter
the
gener
attack
on
the
member
of
thi
group
seem
unjustifi
there
ha
been
discuss
of
thi
issu
in
the
past
we
cant
discu
everyth
at
onc
so
the
fact
that
some
specif
thing
hasnt
been
discuss
recent
shouldnt
be
taken
a
a
sign
of
gener
cowardic
arrog
or
apathi
in
past
discuss
no
one
ha
been
outrag
by
suggest
that
jesu
could
be
black
and
it
ha
been
suggest
by
a
few
scholar
but
the
concensu
is
that
he
wa
most
like
semit
a
you
probabl
know
there
is
a
tradit
that
portray
of
jesu
in
art
tend
to
show
him
a
one
of
the
peopl
thu
you
wouldnt
be
surpris
to
find
african
art
show
him
a
black
and
orient
art
show
him
a
orient
there
are
good
reason
relat
to
christian
devot
to
think
of
him
in
such
a
way
it
also
good
now
and
then
to
have
that
imag
challeng
and
to
think
of
jesu
a
be
a
member
of
xxx
where
xxx
is
