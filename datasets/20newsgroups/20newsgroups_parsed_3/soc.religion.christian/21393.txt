part
of

she
alway
found
that

and
still
consid
each
other
a
part
of
the
extend
famili
to
thi
day
one
of
the
interest
thing
that
jane
said
in
thi
whole
discus
wa
homosexu
is
not
about
what
goe
on
in
the
bedroom
she
found
that
she
wa
much
more
abl
to
have
a
deep
commit
relationship
with
a
woman
than
a
man
sex
in
her
mind
is
onli
a
part
of
the
whole
relationship
the
key
thing
is
how
one
interconnect
with
other
peopl
she
made
a
specif
point
to
say
that
it
wa
not
that
she
had
never
met
a
good
man
sinc
she
wa
marri
to
a
wonder
man
for
a
dozen
year
take
a
few
second
and
honestli
ponder
that
thought
and
it
implic
i
have
thought
about
the
implic
and
it
is
scari
we
have
a
whole
gener
of
famili
broken
up
becaus
some
men
have
decid
that
is
is
okay
to
leav
their
wive
and
child
for
the
thrill
of
a
younger
more
attract
woman
if
we
accept
that
it
is
legitim
for
jane
to
have
divorc
how
can
we
not
accept
anyon
decis
to
divorc
becaus
he
ha
found
someon
with
whom
he
can
have
a
more
deep
commit
relationship
marriag
is
not
a
state
of
be
it
is
a
mutual
journey
in
life
love
is
not
a
passiv
feel
it

accept
for
an

execut
to
dump
hi
wife
of
