show
guest
wa
critic
evangel
christian
say
we
believ
in
absolut
and
think
we
are
the
onli
one
who
know
what
the
absolut
are
we
affirm
the
absolut
of
scriptur
not
becaus
we
are
arrog
moralist
but
becaus
we
believ
in
god
who
is
truth
who
ha
reveal
hi
truth
in
hi
word
and
therefor
we
hold
a
preciou
the
strateg
import
of
those
absolut
there
ha
been
a
lot
of
discus
but
so
far
nobodi
seem
to
have
hit
on
exactli
what
the
critic
of
arrog
is
aim
at
the
arrog
be
attack
is
that
we
think
we
are
the
onli
one
who
know
what
the
absolut
are
in
short
mani
evangel
claim
that
they
are
infal
on
the
matter
of
religi
text
in
particular
the
problem
is
one
of
epistemolog
a
a
shorthand
you
can
think
of
epistemolog
a
how
do
you
know
that
question
it
turn
out
is
a
veri
troubl
one
the
problem
with
absolut
certainti
is
that
at
the
bottom
at
least
some
of
the
think
goe
on
insid
your
own
head
unless
you
can
be
certain
that
everyth
which
happen
in
your
head
is
infal
the
reason
you
did
to
discov
a
sourc
of
truth
is
in
question
and
that
mean
you
do
not
have
absolut
justif
for
your
sourc
of
author
which
mean
you
do
not
have
absolut
certainti
let
take
the
specif
exampl
of
biblic
inerr
and
a
fiction
inerrantist
name
zeke
the
follow
argument
appli
to
the
idea
of
papal
infal
too
zeke
ha
we
presum
spent
some
time
studi
the
bibl
and
histori
and
sever
other
topic
he
ha
conclud
base
on
all
these
studi
and
possibl
some
religi
experi
that
the
bibl
is
a
sourc
of
absolut
truth
he
may
be
correct
but
even
if
he
is
he
can
not
be
certain
that
he
is
correct
hi
conclus
depend
on
how
well
he
studi
histori
he
may
have
made
mistak
and
the
refer
he
use
may
have
contain
mistak
hi
conclus
depend
on
how
well
he
studi
the
bibl
he
may
have
made
mistak
hi
conclus
depend
on
hi
own
reason
and
he
may
have
made
mistak
notic
a
common
thread
yet
everyth
about
hi
studi
of
the
world
that
he
did
everyth
that
happen
in
hi
own
head
is
limit
by
hi
own
think
no
matter
what
he
doe
to
tri
and
cover
hi
mistak
he
can
never
be
certain
of
hi
own
infal
a
long
a
ani
part
of
the
belief
is
base
on
hi
own
reason
that
belief
can
not
be
consid
absolut
certain
zeke
believ
that
he
ha
found
a
sourc
of
absolut
truth
but
that
belief
is
onli
a
good
a
the
qualiti
of
the
search
he
made
for
it
unless
he
can
say
that
hi
own
reason
is
flawless
hi
conclus
are
in
doubt
ani
belief
that
you
hold
about
absolut
sourc
of

depend
in
part
on
your
own

there
is
no
way
out
of
the
loop
onli
an
infal
thinker
can
have
absolut
certainti
in
all
hi
belief
thi
is
easi
to
demonstr
let
go
back
to
our
shorthand
method
of
do
epistemolog
how
do
you
know
imagin
a
hypothet
discus
a
the
bibl
is
a
sourc
of
absolut
truth
b
how
do
you
know
a
i
studi
histori
and
the
bibl
and
religi
write
and
church
teach
and
came
to
thi
conclus
b
how

i
doublecheck

just
becaus
some

how
do
you

they
studi
it
correctli
a
and
a
you
see
b
will
eventu
get
a
to
the
point
where
he
ha
to
say
i
cant
prove
that
there
are
no
mistak
and
a
long
a
you
may
have
made
a

then
you
can
not
be
absolut
certain
there
is
no
way
out
of

thi
is
where
the
arrog
of

aris

peopl
who
