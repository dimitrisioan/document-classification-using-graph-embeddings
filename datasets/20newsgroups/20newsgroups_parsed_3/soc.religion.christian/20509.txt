of
my
father
who
is
in

matt
i
also
have
a
problem
with
the
inconsist
in
the
bibl
and
how
it
seem
to
me
that
too
mani
peopl
have
edit
the
origin
document
to
fit
their
own
world
view
therebi
leav
the
bibl
an
unbeliev
sourc
again
what
histor
document
do
you
trust
do
you
think
hannib
cross
the
alp
how
do
you
know
how
do
you
know
for

well
a
the

ha
i
dont
have
dislik
of
christian
except
for
a
few
who
wont
quit
wit
to
me
no
matter
how
mani
time
i
tell
them
to
stop
but
the
christian
faithorgan
religion
will
never
a
far
a
i
can
see
at
the
moment
get
my
support
well
it
realli
a
shame
you
feel
thi
way
no
one
can
browbeat
you
into
believ
and
those
who
tri
will
probabl
onli
succeed
in
drive
you
further
away
you
need
to
ask
yourself
some
difficult
question
is
there
an
afterlif
and
if
so
doe
man
requir
salvat
to
attain
it
if
the
answer
is
ye
the
next
question
is
how
doe
man
attain
thi
salvat
can
he
do
it
on
hi
own
a
the
eastern
religion
and
certain
modern
offshoot
like
the
new
age
movement
teach
or
doe
he
requir
god
help
if
the
latter
in
what
form
doe
inde
in
what
form
can
such
help
come
needl
to
say
thi
discuss
could
take
a
lifetim
and
for
some
peopl
it
did
compris
their
life
write
so
i
am
hardli
in
a
posit
to
offer
the
answer
here
mere
pointer
to
what
to
ask
few
of
u
manag
to
have
an
unshaken
faith
our
entir
life
certainli
not
me
the
spritual
life
is
a
difficult
journey
if
youv
never
read
a
pilgrim
progress
i
highli
recommend

name
jame
moss
now
i
see
by
your
close
that
one
possibl
sourc
of
troubl
for
you
may
be
a
conflict
between
your
politc
belief
and
your
religi
upbring
you
wrote
that
i
in
my
own
faith
accept
and
live
my
life
by
mani
if
not
most
of
the
teach
of
christ
well
christ
refer
to
god
a
my
father
not
my
mother
and
while
the
male
of
god
is
not
the
same
a
the
male
of
those
of
u
human
who
poss
a
y
chromosom
it
doe
not
honor
god
to
refer
to
him
a
femal
pure
to
be
trendi
nondiscriminatori
or
polit
correct
thi
in
no
way
disparag
woman
nor
is
it
my
intent
to
do
so
by
my
use
of
the
male
pronoun
to
refer
to
both
men
and
woman
english
just
doe
not
have
a
decent
neuter
set
of
pronoun
after
all
god
chose
a
woman
a
hi
onli
human
partner
in
bring
christ
into
the
human
popul
well
im
not
about
to
launch
into
a
detail
discuss
of
the
role
of
woman
in
christian
at
am
with
onli
hour
of

for
that
reason
i
