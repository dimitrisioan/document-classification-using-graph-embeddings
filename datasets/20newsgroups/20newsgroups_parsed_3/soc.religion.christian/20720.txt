subject
could
anyon
answer
thi
question
ive
heard
it
said
that
the
account
we
have
of
christ
life
and
ministri
in
the
gospel
were
actual
written
mani
year
after
the
event
about
year
or
so
is
thi
correct
if
so
whi
the
big
time
delay
i
know
all
scriptur
is
inspir
of
god
so
the
time
of
write
is
i
suppos
unimport
but
i
still
cant
help
be
curiou
ivan
thoma
barr
contact
me
at
the
gospel
arent
date
so
we
can
onli
guess
luke
prolog
is
about
the
onli
thing
we
have
from
the
author
describ
hi
process
the
prolog
sound
like
luke
is
from
the
next
gener
and
had
to
do
some
investig
there
are
tradit
pas
down
verbal
that
say
a
few
thing
about
the
composit
of
the
gospel
there
are
debat
about
how
reliabl
these
tradit
are
they
certainli
dont
have
the
statu
of
scriptur
yet
scholar
tend
to
take
some
of
them
serious
one
suggest
that
mark
wa
base
on
peter
sermon
and
wa
written
to
preserv
them
when
peter
had
die
or
way
about
to
die
one
tradit
about
matthew
suggest
that
a
collect
of
jesu
word
may
have
been
made
earlier
than
the
current
gospel
in
the
ancient
world
it
wa
much
more
common
to
reli
on
verbal
transmiss
of
inform
i
think
mani
peopl
would
have
prefer
to
hear
about
jesu
directli
from
someon
who
had
known
him
and
mayb
even
from
someon
who
studi
directli
under
such
a
person
rather
than
from
a
book
thu
i
suspect
that
the
gospel
are
larg
from
a
period
when
these
peopl
were
begin
to
die
scholar
gener
do
think
there
wa
some
written
materi
earlier
which
wa
probabl
use
a
sourc
for
the
exist
gospel
establish
the
date
is
a
complex
and
technic
busi
i
have
to
confess
that
im
not
sure
how
much
relianc
id
put
on
the
method
use
but
it
common
to
think
that
mark
wa
written
first
around
ad
and
that
all
of
the
gospel
were
written
by
the
end
of
the
centuri
a
few
peopl
vari
thi
by
a
decad
or
so
one
way
or
the
other
