about
the

it
say
that
the
immacul
mother
of

the
ever

have
complet
the
cours
of
her
earthli
life
wa
assum
bodi

glori
thi
wa
defin
by
a
papal
statement
in
though
it
had
certainli
been
believ
by
some
befor
that
like
the
immacul
concept
thi
is
primarili
a
roman
cathol
doctrin
and
like
it
it
ha
no
direct
biblic
support
note
that
cathol
do
not
believ
in
sola

that
is
they
do
not
believ
that
the

is
the
onli
sourc
of

thu
the
fact
that
a

they
believ
that

also
that
it
can
be

im
not

if

cathol
can
tell
u
the
basi
for
these
belief
i
think
it
would
be
appropri

that

contain
one
seriou
error
we

is
pass

it
should
be
note
that
the
