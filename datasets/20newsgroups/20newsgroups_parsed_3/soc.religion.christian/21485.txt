such
a
sexual
promiscu
to
which

el

i
cant
and
when
i
claim
to

of
someon
el
sin
am
i
not
in
fact
judg
him
jesu
equip
u
to
judg
activ
but
warn
u
not
to
judg
peopl
judg
not
that
ye
be
not
judg
c
s
lewi
made
the
same
point
in
an
essay
after
world
war
ii
when
some
christian
leader
in
britain
were
urg
nation
repent
for
the
horror
sin
of
world
war
ii
i
see
your
point
but
i
can
not
more
strongli
disagre
to
repent
mean
to
turn
around
we
a
a
nation
have
behav
incred
arrogantli
toward
god
condon
encourag
and
even
forc
folk
to
particip
in
activ
directli
oppos
to
the
written
word
of
god
we
have
arrogantli
set
our
nation
far
abov
the
god
who
creat
it
and
allow
u
the
luxuri
of
live
in
thi
land
we
have
set
a
bad
exampl
for
other
nation
weve
slaughter
unborn
child
by
the
million
we
have
stricken
the
name
of
god
from
the
classroom
weve
cheat
god
out
of
the
honor
due
him
at
everi
turn
and
we
owe
god
an
apolog
everi
bit
a
public
a
our
sin
have
been
when
jesu
said
judg
not
that
ye
be
not
judg
he
wa
not
address
those
like
john
the
baptist
who
had
repent
and
were
call
other
to
repent
he
wa
address
those
who
remain
in
sin
while
heap
down
condemn
on
other
for
their
sin
hi
messag
to
u
all
wa
to
remov
the
log
from
our
own
eye
befor
remov
the
speck
from
our
brother
but
he
also
said
to
rebuk
and
to
reprov
dont
forget
that
thi
is
a
command
too
our
problem
today
is
that
we
tend
to
judg
and
condemn
a
though
we
were
rebuk
and
we
tend
to
neglect
bring
folk
back
to
the
lord
with
the
excus
that
we
dont
want
to
judg
anyon
in
truth
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
judg
le
and
call
other
to
repent
more
and
to
be
abl
to
distinguish
between
the
two
in
our
own
motif
call
sin
what
it
is
and
do
so
openli
let
it
charg
fall
correctli
where
it
should
but
instead
of
run
someon
into
hell
over
it
pull
them
out
of
their
hellward
path
and
onto
the
heavenward
path
i
deplor
the
horribl
crime
of
child
murder
we
want
prevent
not
mere
punish
we
must
reach
the
root
of
the
evil
it
is
practic
by
those
whose
inmost
soul
revolt
from
the
dread
deed
no
mater
what
the
motiv
love
of
eas
or
a
desir
to
save
from
suffer
the
unborn
innoc
the
woman
is
aw
guilti
who
commit
the
deed
but
oh
thrice
guilti
is
he
who
