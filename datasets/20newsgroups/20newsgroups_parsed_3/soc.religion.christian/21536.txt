dream
and
out
of
bodi
incid
david
e
goggin
write
im
fairli
new
to
these
group
tho
some
have
heard
from
me
befor
welcom
id
like
to
get
your
comment
on
a
question
that
ha
been
on
my
mind
a
lot
what
moralseth
appli
to
dream
and
outofbodi
incid
in
normal
dream
you
cant
control
anyth
so
obvious
you
arent
moral
respons
for
your
action
hm
i
get
a
littl
queasi
around
the
phrase
arent
moral
respons
perhap
becaus
ive
heard
it
misus
so
mani
time
i
rememb
in
colleg
some
folk
tri
to
argu
that
a
person
who
wa
drunk
wa
not
moral
respons
for
hi
action
in
gener
most
folk
cant
control
their
dream
but
perhap
what
you
do
all
day
and
think
about
ha
some
impact
on
them
hm
and
im
not
sure
what
action
are
in
a
dream
but
i
will
note
that
jesu
doe
seem
adam
about
the
fact
that
our
thoughtlif
is
at
least
a
import
a
our
action
go
lightli
with
thi
argument
we
are
all
moral
respons
for
who
we
are
and
dream
might
well
be
an
import
part
of
that
now
there
seem
to
be
altern
dream
and
oob
are
total
mental
phenomenon
in
thi
case
no
moral
appli
beyond
what
might
be
call
mental
hygien
that
is
not
tri
to
think
about
anyth
evil
or
indulgin
in
overli
sexi
or
violent
thought
i
dont
know
a
thing
about
out
of
bodi
experi
ive
had
dream
some
fairli
vivid
one
is
an
oob
just
a
veri
vivid
dream
i
would
argu
that
extrem
interest
in
thi
sort
of
phenomenon
is
a
tad
riski
it
is
probabl
much
better
to
think
about
who
jesu
is
and
who
we
are
in
relat
to
that
than
to
cultiv
a
strong
interest
in
dream
unless
you
feel
plagu
by
dream
that
are
pain
and
out
of
control
then
pray
about
it
andor
get
help
dream
and
oob
have
a
realiti
of
their
own
ie
are
anoth
plane
evid
for
thi
is
that
often
dream
and
oob
are
sometim
done
in
common
by
more
than
one
person
what
on
earth
is
your
definit
of
often
i
know
exactli
one
case
of
two
peopl
who
had
substanti
the
same
dream
at
the
same
time
and
a
they
were
brother
who
had
spent
the
day
do
the
same
thing
i
could
see
whi
their
dream
might
be
similiar
anyway
the
onli
other
plane
i
know
of
is
the
spiritu
realm
i
dont
think
anyon
dream
perhap
outsid
the
occasion
prophet
repres
actual
action
on
an
altern
plane
if
they
were
real
action
or
consciou
thought
then
ye
they
would
have
direct
moral
signific
like
but
here
we
assum
that
garbl
text
becaus
the
dream
occur
in
a
differ
environ
then
differ
moral
law
appli
is
my
guess
of
what
you
said
i
dont
see
the
slightest
hint
in
christian
write
that
one
environ
chang
the
way
a
person
determin
what
is
moral
for
a
christian
wont
it
alway
come
down
to
what
jesu
would
have
u
do
so
there
it
is
is
one
of
these
case
the
truth
or
doe
anyon
know
of
anoth
altern
respond
by
post
or
email
truth
i
dont
claim
to
be
an
expert
in
dream
ill
note
that
the
bibl
doesnt
talk
much
about
dream
outsid
of
the
realm
of
god
use
them
to
speak
to
u
with
the
caveat
that
such
messag
are
not
alway
veri
clear
a
it
warn
somewher
in
the
ot
given
that
i
would
not
give
them
a
lot
of
attent
unless
you
feel
your
dream
are
tri
to
tell
you
someth
i
would
discount
talk
of
altern
plane
though
the
onli
place
such
concept
are
commonli
bandi
about
are
for
the
most
part
hostil
to
christian
though
ive
run
into
the
occasion
except
if
you
are
or
want
to
be
a
christian
you
want
to
be
veri
care
about
idea
like
thi
