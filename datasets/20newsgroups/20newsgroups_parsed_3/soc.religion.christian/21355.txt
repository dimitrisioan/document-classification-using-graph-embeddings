intro
delet
jesu
wasnt
realli
descend
from
david
a
the
messiah
wa
suppos
to
have
been
joseph
wa
but
christian
say
that
joseph
wasnt
relat
to
jesu
truth
if
you
look
at
the
geneolog
of
christ
in
luke
and
the
one
in
matthew
you
will
notic
that
they
trace
differ
line
back
to
david
i
have
been
told
that
one
trace
mari
line
back
to
david
and
the
other
trace
joseph
line
back
to
david
both
of
them
go
beyond
david
in
histori
acord
to
some
of
my
jewish
friend
jewish
is
pass
to
a
child
by
the
mother
and
the
legal
right
of
jewish
are
pass
through
the
father
if
it
is
true
that
one
of
these
geneolog
is
mari
then
christ
bloodlin
is
from
david
through
hi
mother
thi
also
mean
that
christ
had
all
of
the
legal
right
of
a
decend
of
david
a
accord
to
at
least
roman
law
and
possibl
mosaic
law
a
well
but
i
am
not
sure
joseph
wa
christ
legal
father
the
argument
for
luke
genealog
be
that
of
mari
is
veri
weak
accord
to
luke
and
when
he
began
hi
ministri
jesu
himself
wa
about
thirti
year
of
age
be
supposedli
the
son
of
joseph
the
son
of
eli
asid
from
the
fact
that
mari
is
not
mention
there
are
two
possibl
interpret
either
joseph
wa
her
father
or
he
wa
her
brother
clearli
thi
is
not
accept
a
third
would
be
that
joseph
the
son
of
eli
wa
her
father
and
just
happen
to
have
the
name
a
the
man
to
whom
she
wa
betroth
but
that
would
seem
to
be
grasp
at
straw
the
most
straightforward
interpret
is
that
luke
had
no
intent
of
trace
mari
genealog
in
which
case
he
would
have
name
her
but
that
he
trace
her
husband
from
david
son
nathan
the
matthew
descend
list
most
definit
trace
down
from
david
son
solomon
to
joseph
matthew
read
and
to
jacob
wa
born
joseph
the
husband
of
mari
by
whom
wa
born
jesu
who
is
call
christ
there
are
two
appar
problem
the
first
is
how
to
reconcil
the
two
patern
genealog
which
diverg
with
the
son
of
david
solomon
and
nathan
the
second
is
whi
is
ani
genealog
of
joseph
relav
at
all
if
joseph
had
noth
to
do
with
it
if
joseph
wa
not
jesu
physic
father
then
the
origin
poster
is
quit
correct
that
claim
for
jesu
messian
heritag
are
not
base
on
truth
but
onli
on
appear
whatev
jesu
divin
natur
wa
the
second
problem
is
easi
in
my
mind
we
assum
that
joseph
wa
not
involv
in
the
concept
of
jesu
in
ani
way
howev
a
holi
spirit
capabl
of
work
a
physic
concept
in
mari
is
also
capabl
of
employ
the
physic
agenc
of
joseph
seed
in
thi
work
in
our
materialist
time
we
interpret
vigin
and
it
loss
sole
in
term
of
a
physic
act
wherea
it
is
realli
a
matter
of
puriti
on
a
much
higher
level
a
well
the
import
thing
is
that
neither
mari
nor
joseph
wa
consciou
of
ani
union
between
them
they
had
not
knowneach
other
thu
the
first
gospel
dedic
of
half
it
open
chapter
to
the
genealog
of
joseph
is
quit
relev
to
jesu
the
virgin
birth
not
withstand
to
the
first
question
there
is
an
answer
that
creat
to
begin
with
more
problem
than
it
resolv
it
is
that
the
two
evangelist
are
relat
the
birth
of
two
entir
differ
child
of
two
entir
differ
set
of
parent
except
for
the
name
of
the
parent
and
the
child
and
the
birthplac
in
bethlehem
there
is
no
point
in
common
between
the
two
stori
matthew
and
