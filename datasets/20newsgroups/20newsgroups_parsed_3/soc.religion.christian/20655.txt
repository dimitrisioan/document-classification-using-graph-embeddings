which
bring
me
around
to
ask
an
open
question
is
the
bibl
a
close
book
of
scriptur
is
it
okay
for
u
to
go
around
say
god
told
me
thi
and
jesu
told
me
that
wouldnt
that
impli
that
god
is
still
pour
out
new
revel
to
u
i
know
that
some
peopl
will
feel
that
is
okay
and
some
will
not
the
concept
of
a
close
canon
would
certainli
cast
a
shadow
on
contemporari
prophet
on
the
other
hand
an
open
canon
seem
to
be
indic
sometim
let
get
back
to
basic
canon
from
the
latin
mean
a
rule
if
we
say
that
a
rule
is
open
then
it
a
rule
made
to
be
broken
there
is
an
issu
also
of
measur
against
a
rule
thu
the
word
that
are
spoken
need
to
be
compar
against
the
rulecanon
but
not
ad
to
the
canon
is
new
revel
necessari
topic
current
person
revel
id
say
is
necessari
new
revel
for
all
peopl
for
all
time
is
not
necessari
a
we
have
that
in
scriptur
you
also
seem
to
confus
canon
with
scriptur
scriptur
may
speak
of
itself
be
open
ie
god
speak
today
it
would
speak
that
it
is
close
in
the
sen
that
the
canon
is
unchang
though
the
concept
of
canon
is
later
histor
also
interest
to
note
is
that
some
so
call
propheci
are
noth
new
but
rather
an
inspir
translat
of
scriptur
is
it
right
to
call
that
propheci
mislead
wouldnt
that
be
more
have
to
do
with
knowledg
i
know
the
gift
of
knowledg
may
not
be
a
excit
to
talk
about
but
shouldnt
we
call
a
hors
a
hors
i
agre
with
the
problem
of
confus
if
propheci
is
meant
to
encourag
exhort
or
correct
then
is
an
overlap
with
scriptur
if
propheci
is
meant
to
bring
a
word
of
the
form
the
man
you
live
with
is
not
your
husband
then
that
is
knowledg
yet
the
exact
word
their
are
scriptur
i
would
expect
the
differ
to
be
the
motiv
and
mean
for
deliveri
the
read
of
scriptur
itself
can
be
a
power
