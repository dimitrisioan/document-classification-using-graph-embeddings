re
whi
do
peopl
becom
atheist
in
articl
maxwel
c
muir
write
a
lot
of
stuff
delet
im
focus
on
just
one
point
well
he
got
me
there
i
am
a
strong
atheist
becaus
i
feel
that
lack
of
evid
especi
about
someth
like
an
omnipot
be
impli
lack
of
exist
howev
i
havent
met
the
strong
atheist
yet
who
said
that
noth
could
ever
persuad
him
call
me
a
seeker
if
you
like
i
dont
weak
atheism
is
be
ignor
here
though
some
atheist
simpli
say
i
dont
believ
in
ani
god
rather
than
my
posit
i
believ
that
no
god
exist
for
the
weak
atheist
the
is
no
atheism
to
disbeliev
becaus
they
dont
activ
believ
in
atheism
if
you
think
thi
is
confus
tri
figur
out
the
differ
between
protest
and
methodist
from
an
atheist
point
of
view
im
a
littl
confus
about
the
differ
between
thi
weak
atheism
a
you
put
it
and
agnostic
is
agnostic
not
believ
or
necessarili
disbeliev
in
anyth
or
what
is
it
i
use
to
be
agnost
by
thi
definit
but
if
weak
atheism
includ
not
necessarili
believ
in
god
then
i
guess
i
wa
one
of
those
actual
what
i
have
a
hard
time
understand
is
peopl
who
do
not
ever
decid
what
they
believ
i
am
constantli
in
a
state
of
selfexamin
a
it
would
appear
mani
other
are
a
well
includ
the
atheist
of
cours
id
assum
that
whi
theyr
here
i
guess
some
peopl
dont
realli
consid
it
import
to
think
about
the
answer
to
life
the
univers
and
everyth
ani
comment
just
wonder
thi
is
anoth
fallaci
mani
theist
seem
to
have
that
everyon
believ
in
someth
follow
up
by
everyon
ha
faith
in
someth
guess
what
my
atheism
end
the
moment
im
shown
a
proof
of
some
god
exist
is
that
realli
too
much
to
ask
tough
call
a
these
thing
seem
to
be
base
on
faith
wish
i
could
help
you
but
i
alreadi
tri
onc
with
someon
who
wa
a
selfprofess
agnosticthinkingofbecominga
christian
and
it
didnt
work
too
well
especi
tough
a
im
still
mull
over
whether
or
not
i
believ
in
miracl
look
like
anoth
email
to
my
chaplain
is
come
up
all
i
can
do
is
wish
you
the
best
of
luck
and
plea
do
post
what
you
find
and
i
told
you
that
i
find
faith
to
be
intellectu
dishonest
note
that
i
can
onli
speak
for
myself
if
you
find
faith
to
be
honest
show
me
how
hmm
how
so
i
guess
i
realli
dont
understand
there
are
time
of
cours
when
i
say
to
myself
of
cours
i
have
absolut
no
way
of
know
that
what
i
believ
in
is
true
except
the
satisfact
and
sen
of
peac
i
get
from
it
which
of
cours
could
just
be
psycholog
somehow
i
live
with
thi
anyway
is
thi
what
you
mean
the
onli
proof
i
have
is
that
i
believ
god
spoke
to
me
onc
which
could
of
cours
be
my
own
imagin
the
odd
thing
is
though
that
if
you
dont
at
some
point
start
believ
in
someth
after
a
while
it
all
get
sort
of
ridicul
mayb
it
just
a
question
of
where
you
draw
the
line
i
have
been
unabl
to
reconcil
it
so
far
mayb
that
how
im
broken
i
tell
you
that
i
have
invis
fairi
live
in
my
garden
and
that
you
should
just
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
accept
that
you
are
of
a
fundament
differ
mind
than
i
and
i
realli
would
like
to
know
how
you
think
all
i
ask
for
is
proof
of
the
assert
god
exist
logic
or
physic
proof
onli
plea
then
well
discus
the
natur
of
god
ill
onli
add
one
question
have
you
read
pascal
what
did
you
think
of
him
if
you
did
also
you
may
or
may
not
be
interest
by
cslewi
surpris
by
joy
id
be
interest
in
know
what
you
think
of
him
no
sarcasm
at
all
intend
i
just
say
thi
becaus
one
can
never
know
how
one
written
word
will
be
interpret
i
am
not
interest
in
convert
you
sinc
i
dont
seem
to
have
whatev
it
