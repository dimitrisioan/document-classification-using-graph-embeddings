etern
marriag
wa
mormon
templ
in
articl
david
hammerslag
write
thi
paragraph
brought
to
mind
a
question
how
do
you
mormon
reconcil
the
idea
of
etern
marriag
with
christ
statement
that
in
the
ressurect
peopl
will
neither
marri
nor
be
given
in
marriag
luke
chapt
well
here
is
someth
i
wrote
some
time
ago
in
respons
to
a
similar
question
i
hope
it
help
begin
repeat
of
previou
post
a
for
the
scriptur
mention
i
agre
that
it
doe
seem
to
be
a
problem
not
onli
for
etern
marriag
but
marriag
in
gener
luke
version
ha
jesu
say
that
the
child
of
thi
world
marri
and
are
given
in
marriag
but
not
those
who
will
attain
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
almost
sound
like
marriag
disqualifi
one
for
salvat
matthew
and
mark
both
omit
thi
statement
i
think
the
account
are
not
a
clear
a
they
might
be
let
have
a
look
at
the
incid
and
see
if
we
can
come
up
with
some
reason
idea
of
what
it
mean
the
scriptur
involv
are
mat
mark
and
luke
what
happen
wa
that
the
sadduce
who
did
not
believ
in
the
resurrect
thought
they
could
trap
jesu
they
made
refer
to
the
leverit
marriag
which
requir
the
brother
of
a
man
who
die
without
child
to
take
the
widow
to
wife
and
rais
up
child
the
child
would
be
consid
child
of
the
deceas
just
a
though
the
woman
first
husband
had
father
them
it
seem
obviou
from
thi
that
the
woman
wa
still
consid
in
a
way
to
be
the
wife
of
her
first
husband
howev
the
sadduce
concoct
a
scene
in
which
brother
of
the
deceas
each
in
hi
turn
fail
to
father
child
by
the
widow
they
seem
to
impli
that
the
leverit
marriag
wa
equal
to
the
first
for
they
ask
whose
wife
shall
she
be
in
the
resurrect
at
thi
point
it
seem
obviou
that
if
she
is
anybodi
wife
it
is
the
first
husband
after
all
had
she
born
child
they
would
have
been
credit
to
him
regardless
of
which
brother
wa
the
biolog
father
it
is
possibl
jesu
wa
refer
to
thi
when
he
say
ye
do
err
not
know
the
scriptur
or
the
power
of
god
mat
compar
mark
phrase
not
in
luke
account
anyway
the
sadduce
ask
whose
wife
will
she
be
in
the
resurrect
see
that
all
had
her
jesu
answer
is
that
in
the
resurrect
they
neither
marri
nor
are
given
in
marriag
mat
when
they
rise
from
the
dead
they
neither
marri
mark
they
which
are
account
worthi
to
obtain
that
world
neither
marri
luke
all
account
go
on
to
say
but
are
a
the
angel
in
heaven
or
the
equival
i
find
thi
last
not
veri
help
sinc
the
bibl
doe
not
defin
angel
nor
give
ani
idea
what
their
life
is
like
some
minist
claim
that
they
are
sexless
differ
that
human
etc
but
i
can
find
no
biblic
support
for
thi
i
think
what
jesu
is
say
here
and
it
is
clearest
in
matthew
and
mark
account
is
that
marriag
will
not
be
perform
in
the
resurrect
thi
go
along
with
our
belief
that
if
a
person
is
to
marri
at
all
it
must
be
done
on
thi
earth
howev
we
do
believ
that
a
marriag
perform
by
the
author
of
god
can
be
bind
in
etern
in
fact
the
first
marriag
appear
to
have
been
perform
by
god
himself
befor
death
enter
the
world
in
the
garden
of
eden
what
therefor
god
hath
join
togeth
let
not
man
put
asund
mat
jesu
also
told
peter
and
the
other
apostl
that
whatsoev
they
should
bind
on
earth
should
be
bound
in
heaven
mat
i
believ
that
thi
also
refer
to
marriag
perform
by
the
proper
author
