re
question
about
virgin
mari
i
think
your
talk
about
the
assumpt
of
the
bless
virgin
mari
it
say
that
the
immacul
mother
of
god
the
ever
virgin
mari
have
complet
the
cours
of
her
earthli
life
wa
assum
bodi
and
soul
into
heavenli
glori
thi
wa
defin
by
a
papal
statement
in
though
it
had
certainli
been
believ
by
some
befor
that
like
the
immacul
concept
thi
is
primarili
a
roman
cathol
doctrin
and
like
it
it
ha
no
direct
biblic
support
note
that
cathol
do
not
believ
in
sola
scriptura
that
is
they
do
not
believ
that
the
bibl
is
the
onli
sourc
of
christian
knowledg
thu
the
fact
that
a
doctrin
ha
littl
biblic
support
is
not
necessarili
signific
to
them
they
believ
that
truth
can
be
pass
on
through
tradit
of
the
church
and
also
that
it
can
be
reveal
to
the
church
im
not
interest
in
yet
anoth
catholicprotest
argument
but
if
ani
cathol
can
tell
u
the
basi
for
these
belief
i
think
it
would
be
appropri
clh
in
the
bibl
there
are
a
lot
of
instanc
where
god
speak
to
peopl
where
a
person
just
came
to
know
some
piec
of
inform
where
a
person
walk
off
into
the
desert
for
day
etc
with
all
of
god
power
he
certainli
can
do
whatev
he
want
when
he
want
it
the
bibl
end
with
the
book
of
revel
but
doe
god
reign
end
there
no
so
who
can
say
for
sure
that
god
messag
are
either
no
longer
happen
or
still
happen
i
can
now
hear
the
clamor
for
proof
with
the
cold
respons
ive
gotten
from
the
past
from
thi
group
it
veri
hard
to
get
the
point
across
ill
onli
go
over
the
physic
stuff
so
that
skeptic
can
look
at
document
store
somewher
ive
cite
the
uncorrupt
bodi
of
saint
befor
theyr
still
there
the
apparit
at
fatima
portug
culmin
in
a
miracl
specif
grant
to
show
god
exist
that
wa
the
spinningdescend
of
the
sun
it
wa
seen
in
sever
countri
that
event
is
approv
by
the
pope
current
imag
of
mari
in
japan
korea
yugoslavia
philippin
africa
are
show
tear
natur
or
blood
these
are
still
under
investig
by
the
church
but
realiz
that
investig
take
decad
to
finish
and
if
the
messag
is
christ
will
come
in
ten
day
that
a
bit
too
late
isnt
it
other
event
under
investig
are
inner
locut
come
to
know
stigma
the
person
exhibit
christ
wound
and
they
dont
heal
and
doctor
dont
know
whi
nonbeliev
are
welcom
to
pore
through
document
im
sure
thi
stuff
is
not
like
koresh
or
oral
robert
give
me
m
or
god
will
call
me
home
it
free
find
out
whi
theyr
happen
a
we
ourselv
are
studi
whi
if
anybodi
can
figur
thi
out
tell
u
you
can
be
of
ani
religion
if
you
have
the
resourc
go
to
one
of
the
countri
i
mention
these
are
not
member
onli
event
god
and
mari
invit
everybodi
so
in
conclus
final
we
rc
believ
in
the
modern
day
manifest
of
god
and
mari
we
are
scare
to
death
sometim
although
were
told
not
to
there
are
more
proof
and
event
and
that
is
whi
not
everyth
is
in
the
bibl
although
in
a
lot
of
the
apparit
we
are
told
to
read
the
bibl
a
far
a
the
protest
v
cathol
issu
is
concern
in
the
end
god
church
will
unit
im
not
sure
how
i
have
some
idea
but
the
point
is
we
shouldnt
worri
about
the
versu
part
just
do
god
work
that
all
that
matter
uniti
will
come
btw
im
just
a
plain
person
im
not
the
pope
spokesperson
but
