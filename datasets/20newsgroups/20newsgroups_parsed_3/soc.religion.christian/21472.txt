write
there
is
noth
in
christian
that
preclud
the
idea
of
repeat
live
on
earth
doesnt
it
say
somewher
it
is
appoint
to
man
onc
to
die
and
then
judgement
i
dont
have
a
concord
here
but
i
have
some
dim
memori
that
thi
appear
somewher
in
the
bibl
given
a
fairli
specif
context
for
what
judgement
is
id
say
that
more
or
le
decid
the
issu
heb
clh
inde
the
immedi
context
nasb
is
otherwis
he
would
have
need
to
suffer
often
sinc
the
foundat
of
the
world
but
now
onc
at
the
consumm
he
ha
been
manifest
to
put
away
sin
by
the
sacrific
of
himself
and
inasmuch
a
it
is
appoint
for
men
to
die
onc
and
after
thi
come
judgement
so
christ
also
have
been
offer
onc
to
bear
the
sin
of
mani
shall
appear
a
second
time
not
to
bear
sin
tro
those
who
eagerli
await
him
the
first
point
is
that
thi
vers
is
part
of
an
even
larger
context
the
subject
of
which
is
not
the
destini
of
the
individu
human
soul
but
rather
the
singular
natur
of
christ
sacrific
onc
and
the
fulfil
of
the
law
for
all
of
fallen
mankind
rudolf
friel
elabor
thi
in
detail
in
hi
christian
and
reincarn
the
thrust
of
the
passag
in
it
context
is
to
liken
the
one
time
incarn
and
sacrific
of
christ
for
all
mankind
to
the
individu
experi
of
the
human
be
after
death
the
onc
is
repeat
and
emphas
and
it
highlight
the
singular
of
christ
deed
one
thing
for
certain
it
doe
is
to
refut
the
claim
of
some
that
christ
incarn
more
than
onc
but
the
comparison
to
the
human
experi
die
onc
then
judgement
note
not
the
judgement
but
just
judgement
the
word
for
judgement
is
krisi
hebrew
is
the
one
passag
most
often
quot
in
defens
of
the
doctrin
that
the
bibl
deni
reincarn
at
thi
point
i
would
just
emphas
again
that
the
passag
that
arguabl
speak
against
it
are
few
and
that
invari
they
are
talk
about
someth
ele
and
the
appar
denial
of
reincarn
is
either
infer
or
a
in
the
case
of
hebrew
taken
liter
and
deposit
into
an
impli
context
name
a
doctrin
of
the
destini
of
the
human
be
after
death
what
should
be
consid
serious
is
that
the
bibl
is
essenti
silent
about
the
fate
of
the
individu
human
be
between
death
and
the
last
day
if
you
take
the
few
passag
that
could
possibl
be
interpret
to
mean
a
singl
earth
life
they
are
arguabl
and
there
are
other
passag
that
point
arguabl
in
the
other
direc
tion
such
a
matthew
and
john
we
can
continu
to
debat
the
individu
scrap
of
scriptur
that
might
have
a
bearinig
on
thi
and
inde
we
should
discus
them
but
what
i
want
to
introduc
into
the
discus
wa
an
approach
to
the
idea
of
repeat
earth
live
that
unlik
hindu
buddhist
and
new
age
teach
take
full
cogniz
of
the
divin
singular
incarn
death
burial
resurrect
and
second
come
of
christ
a
the
savior
of
mankind
the
account
of
each
individu
for
hi
deed
and
the
realiti
of
the
fall
and
of
sin
and
it
consequ
the
redempt
of
man
from
sin
through
christ
the
resurrect
of
the
bodi
and
the
last
judgement
taken
in
thi
larger
sen
mani
seriou
question
take
on
an
entir
differ
perspect
eg
the
destini
of
those
who
die
in
their
sin
befor
christ
came
the
relationship
of
faith
and
grace
to
work
the
mean
of
deathb
convers
the
mean
of
the
sacrament
and
mani
other
thing
not
that
i
propos
to
answer
all
those
question
by
a
simpl
doctrin
of
conveni
but
onli
that
the
discus
take
on
a
differ
dimens
and
in
my
opinion
one
that
is
truli
worthi
of
both
man
the
earth
and
their
creator
and
redeem
there
are
mani
deep
question
that
continu
to
be
deep
such
a
the
mean
of
the
second
death
and
how
the
whole
of
christian
doctrin
would
appli
to
thi
larger
perspect
of
human
exist
there
are
those
who
deepli
believ
that
the
thing
of
which
the
bibl
doe
not
speak
are
not
thing
we
should
be
concern
with
but
christ
also
indic
that
there
were
other
thing
that
we
would
come
to
know
in
the
futur
includ
thing
that
hi
discipl
and
therefor
other
could
not
bear
yet
thi
idea
that
the
human
capac
for
growth
in
knowledg
not
onli
of
the
individu
in
one
lifetim
but
of
the
whole
of
human
also
take
on
great
mean
when
we
realiz
that
our
growth
in
the
spirit
is
a
long
term
process
the
bibl
wa
not
meant
to
codifi
all
spiritu
knowledg
in
one
place
forev
but
to
proclaim
the
gospel
of
the
incarn
and
redeem
deed
of
christ
take
the
gospel
in
the
greater
context
from
genesi
to
revel
now
salvat
heal
becom
not
the
end
of
man
sojourn
but
it
begin
and
the
last
judgement
and
the
new
