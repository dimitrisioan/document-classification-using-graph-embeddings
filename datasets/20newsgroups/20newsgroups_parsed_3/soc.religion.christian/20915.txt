in
articl
no

lawrenc
bissel
write
i
dont
think
most
peopl
understand
what
a
christian
is
it
is
certainli
not
what
i
see
a
lot
in
church
rather
i
think
it
should
be
a
way
of
life
and
a
total
sacrafic
of
everyth
for
god
sake
he
love
u
enough
to
die
and
save
u
so
we
should
do
the
typic
statement
from
an
irrat
and
brainwash
person
the
bibl
wa
written
by
some
male
chavnist
thousand
of
year
ago
a
were
all
of
the
holi
book
follow
the
part
that
you
think
are
suitabl
for
modern
life
ignor
the
other
for
heaven
sake
dont
take
it
liter
plea
leav
heaven
out
of
it
for
hi
own
sake
i
pray
that
dan
doe
take
it
liter
becaus
that
how
god
intend
it
to
be
taken
dan
your
view
of
mani
group
appear
correct
from
my
point
of
view
howev
i
have
found
a
group
which
is
truli
meet
requir
laid
down
by
the
bibl
on
what
it
mean
to
be
a
discipl
of
jesu
i
have
no
clue
where
wwc
is
but
plea
mail
me
id
realli
like
to
get
you
in
touch
with
them
same
hey
we
cant
do
it
god
himself
inspir
u
to
turn
our
live
over
to
him
that
tuff
and
most
peopl
dont
want
to
do
it
to
be
a
real
christian
would
be
someth
for
the
strong
to
persever
at
but
insert
delet
of
rant
about
other
religion
which
obvious
ha
gone
offcent
of
dan
origin
context
dan
im
familiar
with
thi
one
youv
got
a
point
though
there
are
some
who
dont
want
to
turn
over
everyth
and
be
a
discipl
some
have
no
clue
about
it
becaus
theyv
not
been
taught
some
have
done
exactli
that
and
turn
over
everyth
to
follow
jesu
some
are
block
by
difficult
doctrin
taught
by
uncar
pharise
and
teacher
of
the
law
howev
jesu
point
out
what
it
take
to
follow
him
and
to
be
hi
discipl
in
luke
and
luke
my
question
is
whi
do
peopl
ignor
the
command
and
treat
it
a
option
i
certainli
dont
have
an
answer
to
thi
insert
delet
part
question
would
you
have
becom
a
christian
if
you
had
not
been
indoctrin
by
your
parent
you
probabl
never
learn
about
ani
other
religion
to
make
a
compar
studi
and
therefor
i
claim
you
are
brain
wash
my
parent
had
noth
to
do
with
it
god
had
and
ha
everyth
to
do
with
it
a
for
these
attack
respons
i
must
say
that
i
disagre
with
your
tone
and
what
appear
to
be
some
veri
judgment
statement
possibl
to
the
point
of
slander
when
talk
about
peopl
not
what
they
do
plea
if
you
have
a
respons
state
it
instead
of
fli
off
the
handl
on
some
discours
which
may
have
noth
truli
to
do
with
what
is
be
discus
im
sure
both
dan
and
i
would
have
a
much
happier
time
with
your
respons
