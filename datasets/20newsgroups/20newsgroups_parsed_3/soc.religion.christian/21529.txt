and
add
that
thi
is
not
a
a
result
of
anyth
that

clearli
paul
doe
not
believ
that
they
had
had
previou
life
nor
doe
he
suppos
that
hi
reader
will
believ
it
for
if
they

it
would
not
make

daniel
cossack
write
to
ask
whether
it
is
fair
for
god
to
hate
easau
when
esau
ha
done
noth
bad
i
repli
that
in
hebrew
it
is
standard
usag
to
speak
of
hate
when
what
is
meant
is
simpli
put
in
second
place
a
an
exampl
consid
the
say
in
matthew
no
man
can
serv
two
master
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
now
it
is
obvious
fals
that
a
man
with
two
master
must
hate
one
of
them
but
it
is
obvious
true
that
he
must
put
one
of
them
in
second
place
a
dog
that
alway
come
when
either
billi
or
bobbi
call
will
have
a
problem
if
they
stand
in
differ
place
and
call
simultan
it
can
not
give
first
prioriti
to
both
one
must
take
second
place
in
our
origin
exampl
second
place
mean
that
jacob
not
esau
is
chosen
to
bear
the
coven
bless
and
oblig
and
to
be
the
ancestor
of
christ
eugen

say
of
john
the
baptist
and
if
ye
will
receiv
it
thi
is
elijah

take
thi
to
mean
that

fulfil
the
predict
that
