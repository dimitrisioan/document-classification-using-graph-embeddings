thrown
matthew
talk
about
be
thrown
into
the
etern
fire
and
the
fire
of
hell
it
seem
quit
clear
that
there
is
thi
place
where
a
fire
burn
forev
from
the
revel
passag
it
is
clear
that
the
devil
and
hi
angel
will
be
torment
there
forev
from
the
matthew
passag
it
doesnt
seem
abundantli
clear
whether
the
punish
of
unbeliev
is
everlast
in
the
sen
of
final
or
in
the
sen
of
continu
youv
miss
on
veri
import
passag
thess
for
after
all
it
is
onli
just
for
god
to
repay
with
afflict
those
who
afflict
you
and
to
give
relief
to
you
who
are
afflict
and
to
u
a
well
when
the
lord
jesu
shall
be
reveal
from
heaven
with
hi
mighti
angel
in
flame
fire
deal
out
retribut
to
those
who
do
not
know
god
and
to
those
who
do
not
obey
the
gospel
of
our
lord
jesu
and
these
will
pay
the
penalti
of
etern
destruct
away
from
the
presenc
of
the
lord
and
from
the
glori
of
hi
power
when
he
come
to
be
glorifi
in
hi
saint
on
that
day
and
to
be
marvel
at
among
all
who
have
believ
for
our
testimoni
to
you
wa
believ
thing
to
note
from
thi
passag
unbeliev
are
both
those
who
openli
reject
the
gospel
and
those
who
do
not
know
god
the
etern
destruct
is
the
same
a
the
etern
hope
in
thi
distruct
primarili
emphas
that
it
is
separ
from
the
presenc
of
god
the
context
is
speak
of
the
nd
advent
while
is
speak
of
the
raptur
dont
confus
the
two
in
the
bibl
i
am
not
awar
of
ani
discus
about
the
specif
of
hell
beyond
the
gener
of
hot
unpleas
and
torment
yet
we
have
a
far
greater
discript
of
hell
that
we
do
heaven
for
instanc
it
is
not
discus
how
if
at
all
the
rich
man
can
continu
stay
in
the
fire
and
still
feel
discomfort
or
pain
or
whether
there
is
some
point
at
which
the
pain
sen
abil
is
burn
up
if
you
can
forgiv
the
graphic
if
you
throw
a
physic
bodi
into
a
fire
assum
the
person
start
out
aliv
at
some
fairli
quick
point
the
nerv
are
destroy
and
pain
is
no
longer
sen
if
thi
wa
like
earthli
fire
that
requir
a
ga
produc
substanc
to
ignit
howev
there
seem
to
be
a
differ
type
of
fire
a
express
in
the
burn
bush
that
wa
not
consum
also
the
daniel
acct
show
that
the
law
of
natur
can
be
interupt
even
with
earthli
fire
it
is
not
state
what
occur
when
at
the
judgement
the
unbeliev
who
are
alreadi
physic
dead
are
cast
into
hell
mayb
you
dont
understand
there
will
be
those
who
are
aliv
at
the
end
of
the
millenium
who
will
walk
straight
into
the
gwtj
even
those
who
have
die
in
their
sin
will
be
resurrect
ie
reunit
with
their
physic
bodi
to
receiv
condemn
ie
they
no
longer
have
a
physic
bodi
so
they
cant
feel
physic
pain
thi
is
contrari
to
the
teach
of
scriptur
what
could
be
sen
continu
is
that
those
in
hell
are
to
be
forev
without
god
the
lazarusrich
man
parabl
is
told
with
the
idea
of
have
the
listen
think
in
physic
term
in
order
to
get
the
point
that
some
peopl
wont
listen
to
god
even
after
he
rise
from
the
dead
thi
is
conjectur
at
best
if
you
are
use
it
to
support
the
no
physic
bodi
thesi
the
point
of
the
parabl
is
to
reach
the
hardheart
here
who
are
not
listen
to
the
fact
of
the
resurrect
nor
the
gospel
about
jesu
christ
it
seem
reason
to
also
draw
from
the
parabl
that
hell
is
not
even
remot
pleasant
the
true
awl
of
hell
is
that
it
is
etern
separ
from
god
after
have
seen
the
glori
of
hi
presenc
at
the
gwtj
but
whether
it
wa
open
rebellion
against
the
reveal
gospel
of
christ
or
if
it
is
not
have
known
god
not
saught
him
a
he
is
then
a
paul
say
they
are
without
excuss
and
that
everi
mouth
will
be
stop
there
will
be
no
defens
at
the
judgment
seat
of
god
therefor
we
understand
it
is
appoint
unto
man
onc
to
die
and
then
come
judgment
liter
just
becaus
it
is
horrif
doesnt
make
it
le
of
a
realiti
it
should
compel
those
of
u
who
have
the
rich
of
christ
to
share
it
with
other
rex
