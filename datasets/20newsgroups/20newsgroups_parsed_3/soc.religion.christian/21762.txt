sinc
i
see
no

histori
the
catechumen
were
dismiss
prior
to
the
celebr
of
the
eucharist
it
wa
secret
give
rise
to
the
rumor
that
christian
were
cannib
and
all
sort
of
pervers
claim
the
action
were
consid
too
holi
to
be
observ
by
nonchristian

thank
for
the
repli
but
thi
isnt
quit
the
same
thing
like
i
said
befor
i
can
understand
whi
nonchristian
would
be
deni
access
to
holi
ceremoni
but
the
ceremoni
itself
communion
wa
not
secret
in
fact
all
four
gospel
record
the
first
break
of
the
bread
in
some
detail
communion
wa
a
fellowship
meal
and
it
wa
and
still
should
be
in
my
opinion
inappropri
to
invit
those
who
did
not
share
in
the
fellowship
of
the
bodi
of
christ
the
fact
that
unbeliev
deni
access
to
these
commun
meal
began
to
imagin
all
sort
of
secret
and
debas
ritual
dure
communion
doe
not
by
ani
mean
impli
that
the
earli
christian
were
in
fact
hide
shame
thing
from
the
gener
public
in
fact
i
think
if
you
read
some
of
the
earli
church
father
you
will
find
that
they
were
not
at
all
bash
about
describ
what
went
on
dure
communion
that
whi
it
seem
funni
to
me
when
mormon
who
claim
to
be
the
onli
true
restor
of
st
centuri
christian
insist
on
hide
certain
ritual
on
the
ground
that
they
are
too
sacr
mark
actual
that
not
quit
the
case
john
omit
the
central
element
of
the
last
supper
hi
gospel
is
full
of
symbol
of
bread
and
wine
but
the
actual
stori
isnt
there
some
peopl
think
he
ha
omit
some
of
the
detail
becaus
they
were
not
talk
about
in
public
in
hi
commun
there
is
also
evid
that
some
aspect
of
baptism
practic
were
kept
secret
see
morton
smith
secret
gospel
i
dont
agre
with
hi
lurid
specul
on
what
the
secret
practic
actual
were
but
there
doe
seem
to
be
some
evid
that
mark
omit
certain

becaus
they
were
inappropri
