i
think
it
realli
sad
that
so
mani
peopl
put
their
faith
in
a
mere
man
even
if
he
did
claim
to
be
the
son
of
god
andor
a
prophet
ill
pose
a
question
here
that
got
me
think
what
distinguish
true
religion
from
cult
im
speak
gener
here
not
specifi
about
christian
jerri
falwel
wa
on
good
morn
america
on
tuesday
ostens
to
answer
thi
question
basic
he
said
that
true
religion
follow
a
messag
wherea
a
cult
follow
a
person
but
then
christian
is
a
cult
becaus
the
messag
of
christian
is
the
person
of
jesu
so
what
distinguish
for
exampl
the
branch
davidian
cult
from
the
presbyterian
church
doctrin
differ
dont
answer
the
question
imho
so
dont
use
them
a
an
answer
a
far
a
i
can
see
one
of
the
big
differ
between
davidian
and
christian
is
in
who
they
follow
i
have
sometim
tri
to
put
myself
in
the
foot
of
one
of
jesu
discipl
basic
they
gave
up
a
lot
career
possibl
famili
and
well
a
whole
bunch
to
follow
jesu
so
what
is
the
differ
it
is
quit
plain
jesu
wa
good
and
david
koresh
wa
not
the
problem
is
i
think
is
that
we
tri
to
legisl
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
in
term
of
principl
for
instanc
there
are
thousand
of
law
in
the
u
govern
what
is
legal
and
what
is
not
often
it
is
hard
to
bring
peopl
to
justic
becaus
it
is
not
possibl
to
find
a
legal
way
to
do
it
if
onli
we
could
trust
judg
to
be
just
then
we
could
tell
them
to
administ
justic
fairli
and
justic
would
be
follow
but
sinc
judg
dont
alway
get
it
right
we
have
a
complic
system
involv
preced
and
bunch
of
other
stuff
which
attempt
to
make
the
imperfect
the
justic
of
man
into
someth
perfect
but
what
i
hear
about
the
justic
system
in
the
u
tell
me
that
quit
the
opposit
is
true
there
is
also
a
problem
that
we
tend
to
judg
the
present
more
than
the
materi
be
present
so
we
might
consid
a
rant
christian
to
be
bad
but
an
eloqu
person
from
anoth
religion
to
be
good
thi
go
along
with
the
american
desir
to
protect
the
constitut
at
all
cost
even
if
it
allow
peopl
to
do
bad
thing
i
think
that
it
is
the
messag
that
is
import
if
a
man
is
present
a
fals
messag
even
if
he
is
ever
ever
so
mild
manner
then
that
man
is
perform
a
tremend
disservic
i
know
that
i
am
rambl
here
i
guess
that
what
i
am
tri
to
say
is
that
we
shouldnt
be
look
for
principl
that
tell
u
whi
the
davidian
got
it
wrong
it
is
not
wrong
to
follow
and
worship
a
person
but
it
is
import
to
choos
the
right
person
it
is
simpl
choos
jesu
and
you
got
it
right
choos
anyon
els
and
you
got
it
wrong
whi
becaus
jesu
is
the
begotten
son
of
god
and
nobodi
els
is
jesu
wa
without
sin

nobodi
