bradley
wrote
the
next
sunday
the
sermon
wa
about
joshua
where
the
israelit
take
jericho
and
then
proceed
to
massacr
everybodi
there
except
for
rahab
who
had
shelter
the
spi
with
those
report
about
bosnia
in
my
mind
i
felt
uncomfort
about
the
minist
say
that
the
massacr
the
one
in
joshua
wa
right
but
what
realli
bother
me
wa
that
if
i
wa
go
to
tri
take
christian
serious
i
shouldnt
be
so
troubl
about
the
report
of
ethnic
cleans
in
bosnia
certainli
my
sympathi
shouldnt
be
with
the
moslem
consid
that
the
bosnian
muslim
are
descend
of
christian
who
under
turkish
rule
convert
to
islam
could
the
serb
be
do
god
work
perhap
it
would
be
use
to
ask
whether
those
do
the
ethnic
cleans
could
be
said
to
be
love
those
they
are
kill
in
the
veri
act
of
kill
doe
it
reflect
the
attitud
of
god
who
send
rain
to
both
the
just
and
the
unjust
if
not
then
christian
should
be
uncomfort
with
it
jesu
gave
hi
follow
the
law
of
love
to
follow
and
it
is
by
exhibit
thi
that
discipl
will
be
known
doctrin
or
polit
correct
is
not
the
standard
so
i
dont
see
whi
christian
should
be
move
against
the
serb
becaus
their
ancestor
convert
from
christian
to
islam
it
seem
to
me
that
a
a
christian
you
should
be
troubl
by
the
ethnic
cleans
