write
descript
of
true
and
fals
obedi
obedi
is
not
sole
a
matter
of
compliancerefus
the
natur
of
the
command
must
also
be
taken
into
account
it
is
not
enough
to
consid
someon
complianc
or
refus
and
then
say
whether
they
are
obedi
or
disobedi
you
also
have
to
take
into
consider
whether
the
command
are
good
or
bad
you
ask
where
we
are
i
would
echo
that
question
im
not
tri
to
be
contenti
but
assum
that
the
pope
ha
univers
jurisdict
and
author
what
author
do
you
reli
upon
for
your
decis
what
prevent
me
from
choos
ani
doctrin
i
like
and
say
that
papal
disagr
is
an
error
that
will
be
resolv
in
time
thi
is
especi
true
sinc
council
of
bishop
have
basic
stood
by
the
pope
it
appear
that
much
of
what
lie
at
the
heart
of
thi
matter
is
disagr
over
what
is
tradit
and
tradit
and
also
over
author
and
disciplin
my
question
to
the
support
of
sspx
is
thi
is
there
ani
way
that
your
posit
with
respect
to
church
reform
could
chang
and
be
conform
to
those
of
the
pope
assum
that
the
pope
posit
doe
not
chang
and
that
the
leader
of
sspx
dont
jointli
make
such
choic
if
not
thi
appear
to
be
claim
infal
teach
author
if
i
adopt
the
view
that
im
not
wrong
i
cant
be
wrong
and
there
no
way
ill
chang
my
mind
you
must
chang
your
that
ive
either
left
the
cathol
church
or
it
ha
left
me
the
orthodox
church
doe
not
recogn
papal
authorityjurisdict
view
author
a
present
in
each
bishop
and
in
ecumen
council
we
regard
the
subsequ
develop
of
the
doctrin
regard
papal
author
and
jurisdict
to
be
a
separ
of
the
bishop
of
rome
from
the
orthodox
church
without
go
into
the
merit
of
the
great
schism
at
least
the
orthodox
agre
that
a
split
occur
and
dont
pali
what
appear
to
be
semant
game
like
he
the
pope
but
we
dont
recogn
that
what
he
doe
is
effect
word
asid
it
appear
to
be
a
de
facto
split
so
where
are
we
are
we
in
anoth
arian
heresi
complet
with
weak
pope
or
are
the
sspx
priest
modern
martin
luther
well
the
onli
way
to
answer
that
is
to
examin
who
is
say
what
and
what
the
tradit
teach
of
the
church
is
we
sould
argu
from
now
until
the
second
come
about
what
the
real
tradit
teach
of
the
church
is
if
thi
were
a
simpl
matter
east
and
west
would
not
have
been
separ
for
over
year
mani
cathol
will
decid
to
side
with
the
pope
there
is
some
sound
in
thi
becaus
the
papaci
is
infal
so
eventu
some
pope
will
straighten
all
thi
out
i
thought
that
the
teach
magisterieum
of
the
church
did
not
allow
error
in
teach
regard
faith
and
moral
even
in
the
short
term
i
may
be
wrong
here
im
not
roman
cathol
what
would
be
the
effect
of
a
pope
make
an
ex
cathedra
statement
regard
the
sspx
situat
would
it
be
honor
if
not
how
do
you
get
around
the
formal
doctrin
of
infal
again
im
not
tri
to
be
content
im
tri
to
understand
sinc
im
orthodox
ive
got
no
real
vest
interest
in
the
outcom
one
way
or
the
other
schism
is
a
superset
of
disobedi
refus
to
obey
a
legitim
command
all
schismat
are
disobedi
but
it
a
superset
so
it
doesnt
work
the
other
way
around
not
all
disobey
are
schismat
the
mere
fact
that
the
sspx
priest
dont
compli
with
the
holi
father
desir
doesnt
make
them
schismat
it
doe
if
the
command
wa
legitim
sspx
doe
not
view
the
pope
command
a
legitim
whi
thi
is
a
veri
slipperi
slope
but
my
problem
with
thi
is
thi
accord
to
the
tradit
theolog
of
holi
order
episcop
consecr

not
confer

it
onli
confer
the
power
of

the

true

jurisdict
must

someon

with
the
power
to
confer
it
such
a
the

the

could
