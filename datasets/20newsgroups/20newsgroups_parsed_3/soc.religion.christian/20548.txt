of
the
most
famou
new

scholar
in

professor
of

literatur
in
a
larg
theolog
seminarywrot
to
the
author
in
answer
to
my
question
of
how
the
tomb
becam
empti
and
wrote
it
in
a
letter
not
mark
by
bitter
or
sarcasm
that
he
could
no
more
explain
how
the
tomb
becam
empti
than
he
could
explain
how
santa
clau
come
down
the
chimney
at
christma
time
but
he
didnt
realiz
that
santa
claus
never
did
come
down
ani
chimney
at
christma
time
becaus
there
never
wa
a
santa
clau
and
there
is
a
jesu
he
die
he
wa
buri
in
the
tomb
of
joseph
of
arimathea
and
on
sunday
the
bodi
wa
gone
those
are
fact
of
histori
no
one
can
escap
the
responsi
biliti
of
come
to
some
conclus
about
what
realli
happen
by
mention
a
myth
we
all
abandon
befor
we
were
eight
year
old
anoth
professor
dr
kirsopp
lake
of
harvard
univers
tri
to
explain
the
empti
tomb
by
say
what
no
other
scholar
in
the
field
of
new
testament
critic
ha
ventur
to
adopt
that
the
woman
went
to
the
wrong
tomb
the
fact
are
these
first
so
far
a
we
know
there
wa
no
other
tomb
nearbi
to
which
by
mistak
they
could
have
gone
second
it
is
contrari
to
all
similar
experi
for
three
or
more
peopl
to
forget
the
place
where
they
have
buri
their
dearest
love
one
within
le
than
three
day
even
if
the
woman
did
miss
the
tomb
when
peter
and
john
came
did
they
too
go
to
the
wrong
tomb
third
were
the
soldier
guard
the
wrong
tomb
there
is
of
cours
a
record
of
an
attempt
to
escap
the
evid
of
the
empti
tomb
in
the
new
testament
itself
now
when
they
were
go
behold
some
of
the
watch
came
into
the
citi
and
show
unto
the
chief
priest
all
the
thing
that
were
done
and
when
they
were
assembl
with
the
leader
and
had
taken
counsel
they
gave
larg
money
unto
the
soldier
say
say
ye
hi
discipl
came
by
night
and
stole
him
away
while
we
slept
and
if
thi
come
to
the
governor
ear
we
will
persuad
him
and
secur
you
so
they
took
the
money
and
did
a
they
were
taught
and
thi
say
is
com
monli
report
among
the
jew
until
thi
day
matthew
thi
is
a
good
illustr
of
mani
later
attempt
to
escap
the
fact
that
the
tomb
wa
empti
you
will
notic
at
onc
that
the
chief
priest
and
the
elder
never
question
but
that
the
tomb
wa
empti
they
never
even
went
out
to
see
if
what
the
guard
had
report
wa
truethey
knew
it
wa
true
anoth
fact
about
thi
stori
make
it
ridicul
to
maintain
that
the
tomb
wa
emptyth
soldier
were
told
to
say
that
jesu
discipl
came
and
stole
the
bodi
away
while
they
the
soldier
were
asleep
how
could
they
know
what
wa
go
on
while
they
were
asleep
obvious
such
testimoni
would
be
valueless
in
ani
court
even
asid
from
the
shallow
and
sordid
that
make
u
reject
the
explan
the
veri
charact
and
the
later
histori
of
the
discipl
compel
u
to
believ
they
did
not
steal
and
secretli
carri
away
the
bodi
of
jesu
first
a
professor
heffern
point
out
the
leader
of
judaism
in
jerusalem
who
had
put
the
lord
jesu
to
death
had
noth
to
offer
to
contradict
these
discipl
a
they
continu
to
preach
jesu
and
hi
resurrectionbecaus
all
jerusalem
knew
the
tomb
wa
empti
if
there
had
been
trickeri
here
sooner
or
later
it
would
have
been
suspect
then
prove
second
sure
one
of
the
discipl
even
most
of
them
would
have
confess
the
fraud
under
the
terrif
persecut
they
underw
it
may
be
possibl
to
live
a
lie
but
men
seldom
die
for
a
lieand
most
of
these
men
did
the
result
ultim
would
have
been
that
the
messag
that
christ
had
risen
would
have
suffer
the
fate
of
all
such
unfound
storiesit
would
have
lost
it

instead
thi
