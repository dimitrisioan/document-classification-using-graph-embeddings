i
am
of
the
opinion
that
you
a
save
through
faith
alon
not
what
you
do
a
taught
in
roman
but
how
can
i
squar
up
in
my
mind
the
teach
of
jame
in
conjunct
with
the
lukewarm
christian
be
spatout
if
you
agre
that
good
work
have
a
role
somewher
you
will
gener
find
yourself
in
one
of
two
camp
faith
work
salvat
or
faith
salvat
work
either
work
are
requir
for
salvat
or
faith
will
inevit
result
in
good
work
i
am
also
of
the
opinion
that
salvat
is
by
faith
alon
base
on
ephesian
and
roman
i
also
conclud
that
jame
when
read
in
context
is
teach
bullet
abov
when
jame
speak
of
justif
i
would
claim
that
he
is
not
speak
of
god

believ
sinner
innoc
in
hi
sight
paul
use
of
the
word
instead
he
is
speak
of
the
sinner
profess
of
faith
be
justifi
or
proven
by
the
display
of
good
work
also
accord
to
jame
the
abscenc
of
such
work
is
evid
for
a
dead
or
useless
faith
which
fail
to
save
jame
is
not
a
problem
for
the
doctrin
of
salvat
by
faith
if
it
is
teach
work
would
have
their
place
not
a
merit
toward
salvat
but
a
evid
of
true
faith
