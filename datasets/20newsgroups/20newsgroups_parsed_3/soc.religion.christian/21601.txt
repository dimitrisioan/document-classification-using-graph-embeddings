she
wa
immacul
conceiv
and
so
never
subject
to
origin
sin
but
also
never
commit
a
person
sin
in
her
whole
life
thi
wa
possibl
becaus
of
the
special
degre
of
grace
grant
to
her
by
god
i
have
quit
a
problem
with
the
idea
that
mari
never
commit
a
sin
wa
mari
fulli
human
if
it
is
possibl
for
god
to
miracul
make
a
person
free
of
origin
sin
and
free
of
commit
sin
their
whole
life
then
what
is
the
purpos
of
the
incarn
of
jesu
whi
cant
god
just
repeat
the
miracl
done
for
mari
to
make
all
the
rest
of
u
sinless
without
the
need
for
repent
and
salvat
and
all
that
i
dont
particularli
object
to
the
idea
of
the
assumpt
or
the
perpetu
virgin
both
of
which
i
regard
a
cathol
dogma
about
which
i
will
agre
to
disagre
with
my
cathol
brother
and
sister
in
christ
and
i
even
believ
in
the
virgin
birth
of
jesu
but
thi
concept
of
mari
sinless
seem
to
me
to
be
at
odd
with
the
rest
of
christian
doctrin
