write
it
troubl
me
that
there
have
been
so
mani
post
recent
tri
to
support
the
doctrin
of
origin
sin
thi
is
primarili
a
cathol
doctrin
with
no
other
purpos
than
to
defend
the
idea
of
infant
baptism
if
you
read
all
of
ezekiel
you
will
see
that
god
doesnt
hold
u
guilti
for
anyon
el
sin
so
we
can
have
no
origin
guilt
from
adam
thi
neatli
elimin
the
need
for
a
savior
and
prove
that
we
can
be
save
by
work
alon
if
we
have
no
origin
sin
then
it
is
possibl
for
u
to
save
ourselv
by
not
sin
i
understand
the
reason
behind
your
argument
but
it
lead
to
sheer
folli
origin
sin
is
the
reason
we
need
faith
to
be
save
