gerri
palo
writesbetween
adam
and
eve
and
golgotha
the
whole
process
of
the
fall
of
man
occur
thi
involv
a
gradual
dim
of
conscious
of
the
spiritu
world
thi
wa
precis
my
point
from
a
theolog
bent
those
who
live
immedi
after
the
flood
such
a
noah
ham
hi
son
cush
and
hi
son
nimrod
had
a
much
stronger
appreci
of
divin
wrath
they
also
had
a
stronger
understand
of
the
true
god
in
fact
thi
immediaci
wa
a
caus
of
hardship
for
some
so
much
so
that
atla
who
is
seen
with
heaven
rest
on
hi
shoulder
but
thi
is
not
mere
the
physic
heaven
that
he
is
lift
it
is
to
put
god
and
the
strict
spiritu
of
hi
law
at
a
distanc
and
thu
he
becam
the
elev
of
the
heaven
thi
god
made
men
abl
to
feel
a
if
heaven
were
afar
off
and
a
if
either
the
god
of
heaven
could
not
see
through
the
dark
cloud
or
did
not
regard
with
displeasur
the
breaker
of
hi
law
it
is
interest
to
see
that
it
wa
that
wa
titl
emancip
or
deliver
or
phoroneu
it
wa
nimrod
who
invad
the
patriarch
system
and
abridg
the
liberti
of
mankind
yet
wa
worship
for
have
given
mani
benefit
he
wa
a
deliver
all
right
but
not
a
we
think
of
christ
a
a
deliver
one
deliv
from
a
consciou
feel
of
god
wrath
the
other
actual
perform
a
deliveri
from
god
wrath
and
it
is
up
to
u
to
accept
it
a
true
the
question
of
what
happen
to
human
be
who
die
befor
christ
is
an
ever
present
one
with
christian
i
am
not
readi
to
consign
adam
or
abraham
or
even
cain
to
etern
damnat
i
dont
see
the
problem
from
the
time
of
adam
those
who
look
forward
to
the
come
anoint
one
and
put
their
faith
in
the
fact
that
it
wa
god
who
wa
to
do
the
provis
were
account
a
righteou
but
up
to
the
crucifixion
their
sin
were
onli
cover
not
taken
away
therefor
the
dispens
of
the
church
view
the
account
of
sin
the
same
but
see
it
a
a
complet
action
rom
make
it
clear
that
it
ha
alway
been
salvat
via
faith
and
noth
el
it
is
possibl
to
experi
etern
in
a
pas
moment
the
relationship
of
etern
to
durat
is
not
simpli
one
of
indefinit
extend
condit
of
greenwich
mean
time
i
understand
what
your
tri
to
convey
but
i
dont
think
id
lay
hold
of
it
becaus
the
scriptur
do
equat
the
etern
of
the
second
death
with
the
etern
of
say
the
church
rule
with
christ
jn
tell
u
what
etern
life
is
exactli
a
you
are
correct
that
it
is
much
more
than
nonce
of
conscious
it
wa
also
a
standard
belief
among
mani
peopl
that
even
the
righteou
were
lost
it
depend
upon
your
def
of
lost
the
elect
were
lost
onli
in
time
a
outsid
of
time
they
had
been
chosen
from
the
foundat
of
the
world
existenti
we
were
all
born
lost
but
the
righteou
were
in
christ
and
therefor
never
assuredli
lost
it
would
be
interest
to
share
in
the
result
of
your
studi
of
ancient
peopl
idea
of
life
after
death
mayb
thi
summer
i
could
find
time
to
put
togeth
a
paper
on
it
i
simpli
have
to
buy
more
book
for
myself
and
these
older
book
are
veri
expens
either
that
or
countless
trip
to
the
orient
museum
mankind
fell
into
mist
and
dark
and
at
the
turn
point
of
time
a
new
light
enter
into
the
world
the
light
still
grow
and
we
are
develop
the
eye
with
which
to
see
by
it
much
new
revel
and
growth
in
under
stand
lie
befor
u
our
new
vision
and
understand
is
still
veri
feebl
but
it
contain
someth
new
that
will
grow
in
time
to
embrac
that
which
is
old
and
much
more
a
well
couldnt
agre
with
you
more
our
understand
of
say
eschatolog
is
clearli
clearer
than
that
of
say
isaiah
but
that
is
not
what
i
wa
refer
to
at
thi
point
i
should
acknowledg
openli
my
debt
to
the
work
of
rudolf
steiner
founder
of
anthroposophi
for
mani
insight
that
have
led
me
to
my
view
on
thi
subject
the
way
you
refer
to
it
a
doctrin
put
a
modern
intellectu
color
on
it
i
think
it
wa
much
le
abstract
and
much
more
real
and
spiritu
concret
a
teach
that
struck
much
closer
to
home
than
our
doctrin
or
teach
today
can
be
receiv
no
i
understand
it
a
you
have
said
thi
wa
my
point
i
am
not
so
readi
to
attribut
widespread
notion
in
antiqu
to
simpl
dispers
from
an
origin
sourc
even
if
they
were
pas
on
the
question
is
to
what
extent
did
they
reflect
real
percept
and
experi
ah
thi
is
it
thi
is
the
big
question
howev
i
would
say
again
i
think
that
the
best
lie
is
one
that
ha
an
appreci
amount
of
truth
to
it
look
at
satan
twist
of
god
word
when
he
coerc
eve
that
is
a
veri
interest
studi
the
similar
in
the
midst
of
great
varieti
of
express
of
the
differ
peopl
idea
of
the
time
immedi
after
death
testifi
to
the
presenc
of
an
underli
realiti
ye
that
is
my
point
but
it
is
a
two
edg
sword
for
some
do
not
want
the
underli
realiti
to
be
reveal
they
were
not
known
a
mysteri
religion
for
no
reason
there
wa
the
public
side
of
them
and
there
wa
the
privat
side
that
wa
so
protect
that
the
initi
to
an
oath
of
death
if
they
reveal
that
privat
side
that
is
whi
it
is
so
hard
to
bring
their
teach
to
light
the
mysteri
of
iniqu
that
we
find
in
the
bibl
correl
to
thi
i
think
the
primari
object
of
the
mysteri
wa
to
introduc
privat
littl
by
littl
under
the
seal
of
secreci
and
sanction
of
oath
what
it
would
not
have
been
safe
to
openli
profess
wa
the
true
religion
case
in
point
today
might
be
the
mason
just
a
note
that
they
too
worship
osiri
in
egypt
who
can
be
trace
to
nimrod
the
husband
son
on
the
other
hand
there
is
one
notion
firmli
embed
in
christian
that
origin
most
definit
in
a
pagan
sourc
the
idea
that
the
human
be
consist
essenti
of
soul
onli
and
that
the
soul
is
creat
at
birth
wa
conscious
adopt
from
aristotl
whose
idea
domin
christian
thought
for
fifteen
hundr
year
and
still
doe
today
no
i
disagre
with
you
here
gerri
i
know
what
your
allud
to
in
that
the
church
primarili
the
rcc
did
endors
aristotelian
philosophi
into
their
worldview
but
i
would
disagre
with
you
that
it
origin
in
greec
if
you
are
a
student
of
histori
you
will
come
to
see
that
much
of
what
greec
came
to
expound
to
the
world
a
their
origin
wa
just
an
adulter
of
that
which
they
had
taken
from
conquer
countri
the
soul
is
clearli
mention
and
discus
at
length
in
the
egyptian
religion
a
wa
the
uniti
of
god
and
also
the
triniti
of
god
see
if
you
can
find
wilkinson
egyptian
he
realli
doe
a
number
on
what
the
greek
did
to
what
they
pilfer
from
the
egyptian
he
wa
at
onc
the
father
of
modern
thought
and
at
the
same
time
live
dure
that
darken
time
when
the
percept
of
our
etern
spiritu
be
had
grown
dim
im
not
knock
aristotl
or
plato
or
ani
other
greek
thinker
it
just
that
there
is
noth
new
under
the
sun
inde
i
should
also
clarifi
that
i
do
not
deni
that
etern
irrevoc
damnat
is
a
real
possibl
but
the
narrow
rang
in
which
we
conceiv
of
the
decis
moment
ie
after
the
end
of
a
singl
earthli
life
is
not
in
my
mind
suffici
to
embrac
the
realiti
and
i
think
that
is
whi
the
earli
creed
were
couch
in
term
that
did
not
tri
to
spell
it
out
each
age
ha
it
own
focu
of
theolog
the
earli
church
struggl
with
the
trinitarian
formul
the
reform
dealt
with
author
today
eschatolog
ha
had
much
studi
the
earli
creed
do
not
spell
these
thing
out
in
detail
becaus
they
werent
the
topic
of
concern
there
wa
insuffici
wisdom
accumul
they
didnt
have
the
exeget
tool
that
we
have
today
also
each
age
seem
to
have
an
air
of
revel
to
it
one
age
ha
a
well
tend

cultiv
garden
in

it
would
be
natur
for

to
