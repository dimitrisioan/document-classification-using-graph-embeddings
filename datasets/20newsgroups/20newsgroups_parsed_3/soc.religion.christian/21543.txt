subject
re
homosexu
issu
in
christian
there
some
ambigu
about
the
mean
of
the
word
in
the
passag
you
quot
both
liber
and
conserv
sourc
seem
to
agre
that
homosexu
is
not
the
gener
term
for
homosexu
but
is
like
to
have
a
mean
like
homosexu
prostitut
from
what
i
understand
of
my
experi
in
look
up
thi
word
and
discuss
it
with
a
greekliter
individu
the
mean
of
the
word
is
rather
clear
basic
it
liter
mean
he
who
bed
with
a
man
or
he
who
ha
sex
with
a
man
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
prohomosexu
side
of
the
argument
to
show
that
the
word
ha
an
idiomat
mean
nor
evid
from
it
liter
mean
one
can
specul
all
day
long
that
it
might
mean
someth
els
but
we
need
evid
befor
we
creat
new
doctrin
and
get
rid
of
the
histor
understand
of
the
mean
of
thi
word
link
hudson
ive
read
enough
discuss
of
thi
passag
in
both
liber
and
conserv
sourc
to
be
sure
that
the
mean
even
the
liter
mean
is
not
certain
that
doesnt
mean
one
cant
come
to
some
conclus
nor
doe
it
mean
that
i
think
there
ani
doubt
about
what
paul
think
of
homosexu
but
there
are
plausibl
argument
for
a
coupl
of
differ
mean
