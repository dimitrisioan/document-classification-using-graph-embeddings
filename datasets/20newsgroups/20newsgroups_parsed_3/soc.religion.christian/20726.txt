a
bit
the
essenc
of
marriag

each
other
if
two

that
the

isnt
realli
there
there
are
obviou
situat
in
which
christian
marriag
is
possibl
without
a
civil
or
church
wed
if
your
strand
on
a
desert
island
or
if
your
state
forbid
the
marriag
for
an
unjust
reason
eg
law
against
interraci
marriag
the
legal
concept
of
commonlaw
marriag
is
meant
to
ensur
that
the
state
will
recogn
marriag
that
did
not
start
out
with
the
usual
ceremoni
and
recordkeep
pastor

concern
that

a
an
excus
for
live
togeth
without
a
formal

i
think
the
last
statement
is
danger
i
believ
a
long
a
someon
ha
formal
undertaken
the
respons
of
marriag
they
have
a
moral
oblig
even
if
their
intent
wa
not
right
other
peopl
are
involv
in
the
marriag
coven
if
they
believ
in
good
faith
that
a
marriag
occur
then
i
think
there
are
oblig
creat
to
them
of
cours
there
are
situat
where
intent
can
caus
a
marriag
not
to
exist
the
classic
exampl
is
when
it
done
a
part
of
a
play
but
these
are
except
and
should
be
clear
