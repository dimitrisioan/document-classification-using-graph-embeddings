say
i
would
like
to
get
your
opinion
on
thi
when
exactli
doe
an
engag
coupl
becom
marri
in
god
eye
some
say
that
if
the
two
have
public
announc
their
plan
to
marri
have
made
their
vow
to
god
and
are
unswervingli
commit
to
one
anoth
i
realiz
thi
is
a
subject
qualifi
they
are
marriedjoin
in
god
sight
i
have
discuss
thi
with
my
girlfriend
often
i
consid
myself
marri
though
legal
i
am
not
neither
of
u
have
been
with
other
peopl
sexual
although
we
have
been
with
each
other
we
did
not
have
sexual
relat
until
we
decid
to
marri
eventu
for
financi
and
distanc
reason
we
will
not
be
legal
marri
for
anoth
year
and
a
half
until
then
i
consid
myself
marri
for
life
in
god
eye
i
have
faith
that
we
have
a
strong
relationship
and
have
had
for
over
year
and
will
be
full
of
joy
when
we
marri
in
a
church
first
howev
we
must
find
a
church
we
will
be
live
in
a
new
area
when
we
marri
and
will
need
to
find
a
new
church
commun
anyway
i
feel
that
if
two
peopl
commit
to
marriag
befor
god
they
are
marri
and
are
bound
by
that
commit
rick
szanto
rick
ha
nail
the
problem
down
pretti
well
a
i
can
find
no
scriptur
have
i
miss
it
that
detail
when
you
are
marri
i
have
to
make
some
assumpt
base
on
the
principl
of
scriptur
it
seem
to
me
that
it
take
parti
to
make
a
marriag
husbandtob
wifetob
and
god
if
you
promis
befor
each
other
and
god
that
you
will
conven
togeth
to
be
marri
thenyou
are
imo
so
whi
do
we
have
the
ceremoni
part
that
seem
to
be
there
for
connected
in
the
bodi
of
christ
my
brother
and
sister
ought
to
be
involv
so
that
there
can
be
some
account
on
both
our
part
that
part
of
the
concept
from
hebrew
about
not
forsak
the
assembl
of
yourselv
togeth
a
is
the
custom
of
some
we
need
each
other
becaus
lone
ranger
christian
and
lone
ranger
marriag
smack
of
a
self
suffici
that
the
i
dont
see
in
the
nt
doe
anyon
see
the
paul
simon
i
am
a
rock
i
am
an
island
model
anywher
in
christian
song
lyric
show
your
age
further
sinc
marriag
is
a
legal
matterinstitut
in
the
usa
and
mani
other
place
and
such
law
do
not
specif
go
crosswis
to
the
clear
teach
of
scriptur
we
ought
to
obey
them
to
avoid
even
the
appear
of
evil
i
thess
so
thi
would
impli
at
least
a
civil
ceremoni
befor
marriag
but
keep
in
mind
we
are
at
least
do
all
of
thi
for
the
conscienc
of
other
becaus
back
to
the
beginningy
are
marri
when
you
and
your
intend
promis
each
other
and
god
to
be
in
conven
imo
what
chall
think
bobbi
akguarjb
in
some
state
the
kind
of
commit
describ
in
richard
szanto
post
can
creat
a
common
law
marriag
inde
hi
post
itself
might
go
a
long
way
toward
establish
that
a
marriag
exist
should
the
issu
ever
end
up
in
court
he
might
want
to
consult
a
lawyer
who
is
familiar
