subject
be
right
about
messiah
i
must
have
miss
the
post
about
waco
david
koresh
and
the
second
come
how
doe
one
tell
if
a
second
come
is
the
real
thing
unless
the
person
claim
to
be
it
is
obvious
insan
im
not
say
that
david
koresh
is
the
second
come
of
christ
how
could
somebodi
who
break
hi
word
be
the
second
come
koresh
did
promis
that
he
would
come
out
of
hi
compound
if
onli
he
wa
allow
to
give
a
radio
broadcast
he
didnt
still
it
seem
to
me
that
he
did
fool
some
peopl
and
from
my
meagr
knowledg
of
the
bibl
it
seem
that
christian
have
been
hard
on
the
jew
of
christ
day
for
be
cautiou
about
accept
somebodi
that
their
religi
author
didnt
accept
a
the
messiah
so
i
wa
surpris
that
nobodi
had
discus
the
difficulti
of
want
to
be
earli
to
recogn
the
second
come
while
at
the
same
time
not
want
to
be
credul
believ
just
anybodi
who
claim
to
be
god
mark
and
then
if
ani
one
say
to
you
look
here
is
the
christ
or
look
there
he
is
do
not
believ
it
mark
fals
christ
and
fals
prophet
will
aris
and
show
sign
and
wonder
to
lead
astray
if
possibl
the
elect
mark
but
take
heed
i
have
told
you
all
thing
beforehand
mark
but
in
those
day
after
that
tribul
the
sun
will
be
darken
and
the
moon
will
not
give
it
light
mark
and
the
star
will
be
fall
from
heaven
and
the
power
in
the
heaven
will
be
shaken
mark
and
then
they
will
see
the
son
of
man
come
in
cloud
with
great
power
and
glori
my
understand
of
jesu
answer
is
that
unlik
hi
first
come
which
wa
veil
the
second
come
will
be
quit
unmistak
he
tell
u
not
to
be
misl
by
the
other
thing
that
have
to
happen
befor
hi
second
come
the
actual
second
come
will
make
hi
power
openli
visibl
by
the
way
from
koresh
public
statement
it
not
so
clear
to
me
that
he
is
claim
to
be
christ
