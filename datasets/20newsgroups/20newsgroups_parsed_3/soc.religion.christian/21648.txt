through
your

we
are
rais

roman
through
a
person
faith
in
the
power
of
god
our
parent
faith
can
not
do
thi
do
infant
have
faith
let
look
at
what
the
bibl
ha
to
say
about
it
i
dont
think
the
issu
of
whether
infant
have
faith
is
relev
or
not
certainli
they
can
a
the
exampl
of
john
in
utero
prove
i
find
the
translat
of
col
abov
odd
in
term
of
the
circumcis
of
christ
which
the
kjv
and
rsv
put
in
term
of
christ
cricumcis
which
we
in
union
with
him
particip
in
put
off
the
bodi
of
sin
of
the
flesh
also
perhap
cor
is
divid
the
act
of
burial
with
him
in
baptism
which
can
be
independ
of
faith
from
the
experi
of
rise
with
christ
by
faith
who
say
both
are
by
faith
thi
interpret
ha
the
advantag
of
explain
those
who
are
faithlessli
baptiz
for
whom
their
baptisim
is
not
benefit
but
serv
to
put
them
into
the
kingdom
nonetheless
like
the
israelit
all
of
them
child
includ
who
were
baptiz
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
it
wa
of
no
advantag
becaus
they
did
not
add
to
their
baptism
faith
and
obedi
baptism
doe
not
impart
faith
nor
is
it
done
strictli
speak
on
the
basi
of
the
faith
of
the
parent
but
becaus
of
the
covcen
promis
of
god
it
impart
grace
the
grace
of
the
kingdom
which
can
be
a
punish
in
disguis
if
there
is
later
apostaci
roman
but
not
all
the
israelit
accept
the
good
news
for
isaiah
say
lord
who
ha
believ
our
messag
consequ
faith
come
from
hear
the
messag
and
the
messag
is
heard
through
the
word
of
christ
so
then
we
receiv
god
gift
of
faith
to
u
a
we
hear
the
messag
of
the
gospel
faith
is
a
possibl
respons
to
hear
god
word
preach
kid
are
not
yet
spiritu
intellectu
or
emot
matur
enough
to
respond
to
god
word
henc
they
can
not
have
faith
and
therefor
can
not
be
rais
in
baptism
to
a
new
life
do
you
teach
a
child
to
pray
the
lord
prayer
do
you
expect
them
to
not
steal
they
can
have
faith
appropri
to
their
condit
and
in
the
new
coven
we
shall
no
longer
say
know
the
lord
for
they
shall
all
know
him
from
the
least
unto
the
greatest
heb
if
you
read
all
of
ezekiel
you
will
see
that
god
doesnt
hold
u
guilti
for
anyon
el
sin
so
we
can
have
no
origin
guilt
from
adam
but
also
accord
to
ezekiel
god
will
not
hold
innoc
anyon
on
the
basi
of
anyon
el
innocens
thu
jesu
could
not
be
our
feder
head
ani
more
than
adam
if
that
what
ezekiel
is
talk
about
shall
you
make
ezekiel
contradict
the
second
commandemnt
a
well
ezekiel
rid
yourselv
of
all
the
offens
you
have
committ
and
get
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit
whi
will
you
die
o
hous
of
israel
for
i
take
no
pleasur
in
the
death
of
anyon
declar
the
sovereign
lord
repent
and
live
the
way
to
plea
god
is
to
repent
and
get
a
new
heart
and
spirit
kid
can
not
do
thi
act
say
that
when
we
repent
and
are
baptiz
we
will
then
receiv
a
new
spirit
the
holi
spirit
then
we
shall
live
ezekiel
indic
that
thi
new
heart
will
be
given
by
god
in
the
context
of
the
sprinkl
of
water
in
baptism
it
is
the
action
of
god
pute
them
into
hi
new
order
and
not
a
question
ofperson
faith
a
such
roman
therefor
just
a
sin
enter
the
world
through
one
man
and
death
through
sin
and
in
thi
way
death
came
to
all
men
becaus
all
sin
sin
and
death
enter
the
world
when
the
first
man
sin
death
came
to
each
man
becaus
each
man
sin
note
that
it
good
to
read
through
all
of
roman
some
of
the
vers
are
easier
to
misunderstand
than
other
but
if
we
read
them
in
context
we
will
see
that
they
are
all
say
basic
the
same
thing
let
look
at
one
such
but
the
death
that
came
to
all
becaus
of
sin
is
not
just
their
person
death
but
the
dead
state
originb
sin
we
are
in
a
coven
of
death
becaus
adam
our
feder
head
gave
over
hi
dominion
to
the

and
death
psalm
sure
i
wa
sin
at
birth
sin
from
the
time
my
mother
conceiv
me
thi
whole
psalm
is
a
wonder
exampl
of
how
we
should
humbl
ourselv
befor
god
in
repent
for
sin
david
himself
wa
a
man
after
god
own
heart
and
wrote
the
psalm
after
commit
adultri
with
bathsheba
and
murder
her
husband
all
that
david
is
say
here
is
that
he
cant
rememb
a
time
when
he
wasnt
sin
he
is
humbl
himself
befor
god
by
confess
hi
sin
hi
say
that
he
wa
sin
at
birth
is
a
hyperbol
the
bibl
be
inspir
by
god
isnt
limit
to
a
liter
interpet
but
also
use
figur
of
speech
a
did
jesu
john
for
anoth
exampl
of
hyperbol
see
luke
while
thi
psalm
is
figur
in
it
languag
it
is
not
hyperbol
and
the
one
doe
not
necessarili
impli
the
other
there
is
not
other
hyperbol
languag
in
thi
psalm
what

to
is
what
is
symbol
by
the
ot
cleanli
law
which
make
intercours
and
childbrith
both
act
which

with
bathsheba
includ
thi
element
a
he
did
not
ritual
clean
himself
when
he
should
have
but
what
wa
symbol
by
the
ot

the
truth
that
