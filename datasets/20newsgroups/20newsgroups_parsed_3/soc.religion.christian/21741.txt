i
think
we
must
be
care
befor
we
total
throw
out
leviticu
if
the
law
is
reflect
of
god
charact
and
true
holi
natur
then
those
who
say
that
god
endors
homosexu
run
into
a
problem
though
thi
will
be
address
in
the
seri
of
articl
im
post
now
under
aresnokoitia
i
cant
wait
thi
just
realli
blew
my
sock
off
read
i
tim
vers
speak
against
those
who
have
pervert
the
teach
of
the
mosaic
law
in
vv
we
have
in
order
the
th
thru
the
th
command
and
in
the
midst
of
thi
list
is
homosexu
the
decalogu
abov
everyth
els
is
seen
a
god
absolut
if
you
dont
believ
in
absolut
then
you
have
noth
do
do
with
jehovah
of
the
ot
which
paul
reveal
to
be
the
messiah
of
the
nt
lord
christ
jesu
transliter
to
read
jehovah
anoint
savior
in
i
cor
we
see
the
same
emphasi
of
moral
separ
from
the
pagan
gentil
a
we
do
in
lev
in
i
cor
onli
one
notat
drunkard
is
not
found
in
lev
paul
wa
not
naiv
in
hi
use
of
the
lxx
he
knew
full
well
how
he
wa
use
the
law
of
god
that
wa
given
in
the
ot
for
applic
in
the
nt
a
ive
said
the
law
wa
fulfil
not
done
away
with
of
question
we
are
tri
to
deal
with
he
encount
homosexu
onli
in
context
where
most
peopl
would
probabl
agre
that
it
wa
wrong
he
had
never
face
the
experi
of
christian
who
tri
to
act
straight
and
fail
and
he
had
never
face
christian
who
are
tri
to
defin
a
christian
homosexu
which
fit
with
gener
christian
ideal
of
fidel
and
of
see
sexual
a
a
mirror
of
the
relationship
between
god
and
man
it
is
unfair
to
take
paul
judgement
on
homosexu
among
idolat
and
use
it
to
make
judgement
on
these
question
thi
understand
is
thoroughli
rebut
in
deyoung
articl
that
is
be
post
pleas
refer
to
it
one
of
the
reason
that
some
of
u
do
not
accept
that
common
argument
is
becaus
paul
probabl
did
face
thi
and
other
problem
we
can
do
better
than
probabl
which
is
not
an
adequ
defens
against
the
statement
that
paul
cultur
didnt
have
the
same
understand
of
homosexu
a
our
again
read
the
articl
becaus
it
us
fact
i
claim
that
the
question
of
how
to
counsel
homosexu
christian
is
not
entir
a
theolog
issu
but
also
a
pastor
one
i
dont
see
how
you
come
to
that
conclus
i
think
i
do
becaus
i
have
work
in
the
homosexu
commun
by
mean
of
work
with
aid
patient
the
pastor
is
mere
the
practic
applic
of
the
theolog
truth
howev
those
who
are
work
thru
the
issu
of
homosexu
need
to
have
our
love
and
understand
just
a
with
a
friend
who
is
contipl
cheat
on
hi
wife
or
a
friend
who
life
with
hi
girlfriend
yet
you
continu
to
wit
to
him
but
onc
the
choic
is
made
and
there
is
no
remors
then
i
feel
that
paul
pastor
care
a
present
in
the
corinthian
church
come
to
bear
signific
the
one
in
activ
rebellion
should
be
place
outsid
of
the
church
if
a
believ
and
if
a
nonbeliev
then
one
wipe
hi
sandel
and
leaf
it
in
god
hand
if
there
wa
a
member
in
your
youth
group
who
wa
constantli
paw
at
the
littl
girl
you
wouldnt
hesit
to
deal
with
the
matter
quickli
and
decisivli
that
in
part
betray
the
present
polit
correct
of
the
issu
pederasti
is
not
accept
at
the
present
but
some
how
we
are
to
accept
homosexu
becaus
the
latter
is
polit
correct
while
the
former
is
not
at
least
not
yet
thi
is
how
the
moral
decay
i
guess
thi
would
follow
the
liber
applic
in
the
polit
realm
of
econom
the
liber
want
to
tax
the
rich
in
the
feder
yet
in
their
own
state
when
they
tri
to
get
busi
to
settl
there
they
give
tax
incent
to
these
same
richi
it
come
down
to
a
moral
code
of
rel
or
to
use
the
cultur
thing
polit
correct
at
the
moment
rex
you
might
want
to
look
over
tim
again
if
thi
is
realli
the
th
through
th
command
we
seem
to
be
miss
thief
and
homosexu
would
have
to
be
fit
in
under
adulteri
thi
is
of
cours
possibl
if
arsenokoitia
ha
a
narrow
mean
than
homosexu
in
gener
but
i
think
that
not
your
thesi
i
have
no
object
per
se
to
the
idea
that
the
author
of
tim
might
have
quot
the
command
but
through
minu
one
and
plu
a
few
thing
begin
to
look
