in

write
in

maxwel
c
muir
write
of
faith
if
you
want
to
know
i
feel
that
faith
is
intellectu
dishonest
id
appreci
some
support
for
thi
statement
im
not
sure
it
realli
make
sens
to
me
i
defin
faith
a
belief
in
the
abscensesp
of
evid
i
also
includ
in
evid
past
experi
becaus
i
have
no
past
experi
in
a
god
actual
have
an
effect
on
my
life
and
becaus
i
have
never
seen
evid
for
ani
god
beyond
what
can
be
explain
without
the
neccess
of
a
god
or
which
is
more
convinc
than
the
mani
fiction
work
i
have
read
and
other
reason
i
do
not
believ
in
ani
god
from
what
i
have
seen
some
peopl
reconcil
thi
lack
of
evid
by
use
faith
it
is
faith
in
that
sens
the
onli
way
i
current
understand
the
word
faith
that
i
find
intellectu
dishonest
the
ambigu
of
religi
belief
an
unwilling
to
take
pascal
wager
ive
heard
thi
frequent
what
exactli
is
pascal
wager
pascal
wager
go
someth
like
thi
premis
either
there
is
or
there
isnt
a
god
premis
if
god
exist
he
want
u
to
believ
and
will
damn
u
for
not
believ
premis
if
god
doe
not
exist
then
belief
in
god
doesnt
matter
becaus
death
is
death
anyway
conclus
belief
in
god
is
superior
to
nonbelief
becaus
nonbelief
damn
u
to
etern
punish
if
we
are
wrong
while
belief
in
god
onli
wast
a
littl
time
in
life
if
we
are
wrong
sound
pretti
straightforward
and
is
logic
sound
the
problem
is
premis
presuppos
odd
between
belief
and
nonbelief
thi
is
flat
out
wrong
becaus
of
the
sheer
number
of
religion
out
there
and
the
fact
that
for
the
most
part
the
religion
are
mutual
exclus
i
have
heard
theist
refer
to
a
atheist
becaus
they
believ
in
their
god
or
god
to
be
the
one
god
or
set
of
god
the
consequ
of
thi
is
what
if
i
pick
the
wrong
god
suddenli
the
odd
dont
look
so
good
becaus
pick
the
wrong
god
or
wrong
doctrin
of
a
god
still
leaf
you
with
the
possibl
of
be
wrong
and
be
damn
to
anoth
god
version
of
hell
do
i
sound
broken
to
you
i
dont
know
you
point
out
that
your
mother
treatment
upset
you
and
see
inconsist
in
variou
religion
im
not
sure
if
that
constitut
broken
or
not
it
certainli
consititut
disillusion
i
dont
see
how
disillusion
enter
into
it
you
see
i
present
my
mother
treatment
of
me
to
show
the
caus
of
my
question
my
atheism

question

continu
to

becom
somewhat
disillus
with
atheism

thought
what
if
there
is
a
god
ye
in
a
way
i
have
also
becom
disillus
by
mani
religion

becaus

had
thought
at
one
time
that
they
had
all
the
answer
if
i
onli
found
the
right
one
im
still
look
but
each
time
i
look
in
a
differ
place
i
becom
a
littl
stronger
in
my
attitud
belief
if
you
will
no
faith
though
it
base
on
the
evid
of
past
experi
that
ill
never
find
a
religion
which
ha
all
