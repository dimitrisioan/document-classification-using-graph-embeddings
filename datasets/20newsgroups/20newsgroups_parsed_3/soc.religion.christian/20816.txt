some
say
that
if
the

have
public
announc
their
plan
to
marri
have
made
their
vow
to
god
and
are
unswervingli
commit
to
one
anoth
i
realiz
thi
is
a
subject
qualifi
they
are
marriedjoin
in
god
sight
the
way
i
read
scriptur
a
coupl
becom
marri
when
they
are
physic
marri
ie
when
they
first
have
sexual
intercours
eg
the
end
of
genesi
quot
from
memori
for
thi
reason
a
man
shall
leav
hi
parent
and
be
join
to
hi
wife
and
they
will
becom
one
flesh
jesu
also
quot
thi
scriptur
refer
to
marriag
if
you
read
through
genesi
in
particular
you
will
often
come
across
the
phraseolog
man
lay
with
woman
and
she
becam
hi
wife
thi
impli
that
she
becam
hi
wife
when
they
lay
togeth
ie
at
the
point
of
intercours
compar
thi
with
jewish
tradit
joseph
when
he
heard
that
mari
wa
pregnant
had
it
in
mind
to
divorc
her
quietli
but
mari
and
joseph
were
betroth
not
marri
ie
they
were
in
a
bind
relationship
which
requir
a
divorc
to
get
out
of
but
marriag
would
not
occur
until
mari
and
joseph
went
to
bed
togeth
compar
with
christ
and
the
church
ephesian
revel
the
church
is
describ
a
the
bride
of
christ
but
the
marriag
of
the
lamb
take
place
when
jesu
return
ie
we
are
in
a
bind
loverelationship
with
jesu
but
we
are
still
look
forward
to
the
time
when
the
marriag
will
take
place
i
see
thi
a
the
spiritu
equival
of
sexual
intercours
becaus
it
repres
the
most
intim
fellowship
possibl
between
man
and
god
in
summari
engag
should
be
honour
a
a
bind
relationship
but
it
is
not
marriag
a
civil
ceremoni
is
not
marriag
either
marriag
occur
at
the
point
when
the
betroth
coupl
go
to
bed
togeth
i
dont
mean
to
demean
the
civil
or
church
ceremoni
our
wa
great
i
dont
mean
to
be
too
pedant
histor
i
think
i
am
correct
in
state
that
the
civil
ceremoni
ie
a
marriag
recognis
by
the
state
ha
onli
been
around
in
the
west
sinc
napoleon
who
introduc
it
to
keep
tab
on
the
peopl
although
im
readi
to
be
correct
on
that
point
thi
view
obvious
rais
some
question
what
about
those
who
have
had
sex
with
one
or
more
partner
without
consid
marriag
are
those
peopl
also
marri
if
it
is
true
that
marriag
occur
at
the
point
of
intercours
is
it
necessari
to
be
marri
in
the
eye
of
the
state
i
would
say
ye
becaus
thi
honour
the
law
of
our
nation
in
the
west
although
it
is
not
illeg
to
sleep
togeth
though
unmarri
in
most
western
countri
i
believ
that
it
is
god
honour
to
proclaim
our
marriag
to
the
state
and
to
our
friend
befor
actual
consumm
our
marriag
it
to
do
with
our
be
salt
and
light
and
also
to
do
with
how
peopl
will
perceiv
u
ie
it
is
cultur
insensit
to
declar
yourself
marri
without
go
through
a
civil
ceremoni
