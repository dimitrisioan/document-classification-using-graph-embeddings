marri
in

in

nichola
mandock
write
i
am
not
against
capit
punish
i
feel
thi
way
becaus
god
is
not
onli
a
god
of
love
but
a
god
of
justic
a
we
christian
are
the
instrument
of
hi
will
here
on
earth
we
are
expect
to
be
true
to
the
mandat
given
u
by
the
lord
to
judg
the
action
of
our
fellow
man
my
favorit
scriptur
refer
in
thi
regard
is
roman
let
everi
person
be
subordin
to
the
higher
author
for
there
is
no
author
except
from
god
and
those
that
exist
have
been
establish
by
god
therefor
whoever
resist
author
oppos
what
god
ha
appoint
and
those
who
oppos
it
will
bring
judgment
upon
themselv
my
view
reflect
the
teach
of
the
roman
cathol
church
i
would
say
onli
to
the
extent
that
the
roman
cathol
church
neither
approv
nor
disapprov
of
capit
punish
a
confirm
in
the
recent
catech
though
there
are
mani
rc
who
were
rather
surpris
and
upset
that
capit
punish
wa
not
explicitli
condemn
for
myself
a
a
cathol
i
see
my
own
opposit
to
capit
punish
a
much
the
same
a
my
opposit
to
abort
a
rever
for
life
here
in
the
uk
the
antiabort
case
is
often
let
down
by
the
explicit
link
which
those
on
the
polit
left
make
with
antiabortionist
and
proexecutionist
there
is
a
tendenc
to
condemn
peopl
who
hold
both
view
a
hypocrit
i
feel
that
if
there
were
mani
more
antiabortionist
who
were
also
vocal
in
their
opposit
to
capit
punish
on
a
prolif
line
it
would
end
thi
kneejerk
associ
of
antiabort
a
a
rightw
thing
and
get
mani
to
think
serious
about
the
issu
there
are
plenti
who
are
proabort
equal
for
a
kneejerk
leftw
reason
i
do
not
think
your
biblic
quot
can
automat
be
taken
a
support
for
capit
punish
i
take
it
that
a
a
roman
cathol
you
are
oppos
to
abort
and
would
still
onsid
it
wrong
and
someth
to
be
object
to
even
if
