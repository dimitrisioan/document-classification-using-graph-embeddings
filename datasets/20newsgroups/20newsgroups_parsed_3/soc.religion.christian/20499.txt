re
prophet
warn
to
new
york
citi
in
articl
evenson
thoma
randal
write
which
bring
me
around
to
ask
an
open
question
is
the
bibl
a
close
book
of
scriptur
is
it
okay
for
u
to
go
around
say
god
told
me
thi
and
jesu
told
me
that
wouldnt
that
impli
that
god
is
still
pour
out
new
revel
to
u
i
know
that
some
peopl
will
feel
that
is
okay
and
some
will
not
the
concept
of
a
close
canon
would
certainli
cast
a
shadow
on
contemporari
prophet
on
the
other
hand
an
open
canon
seem
to
be
indic
sometim
there
are
a
lot
of
peopl
run
around
say
god
told
me
thi
and
god
told
me
that
these
day
some
peopl
realli
have
heard
god
and
other
heard
their
gland
mario
murrillo
mention
thi
in
a
sermon
onc
he
said
someon
told
him
the
lord
gave
me
a
song
he
said
that
it
wa
the
worst
song
he
had
ever
heard
i
know
whi
he
gave
you
that
song
murillo
said
he
didnt
want
it
anymor
but
god
doe
still
speak
to
hi
peopl
today
and
the
idea
is
contrari
to
the
idea
of
a
close
cannon
ireneau
wrote
about
all
the
gift
of
the
spirit
in
the
church
of
hi
day
nd
and
rd
centuri
and
he
wa
one
of
the
first
to
put
forth
a
new
testament
cannon
which
wa
almost
ident
to
the
one
we
have
today
he
believ
in
a
close
cannon
mani
prophet
prophesi
propheci
which
were
not
record
in
the
scriptur
for
exampl
one
prophet
in
king
whose
name
start
with
an
m
who
propheci
that
the
king
would
lose
a
battl
that
is
the
onli
propheci
he
gave
record
in
scriptur
and
we
no
that
he
had
given
other
propheci
becaus
the
king
complain
befor
he
heard
the
propheci
he
never
prophesi
anyth
good
about
me
yet
onli
one
littl
paragraph
of
all
of
hi
lifetim
of
propheci
are
record
in
scriptur
there
are
numer
exampl
barnaba
wa
a
prophet
act
say
befor
he
wa
even
sent
out
a
an
apostl
yet
hi
write
are
not
record
in
scriptur
onli
two
of
agabu
propheci
are
mention
in
scriptur
he
wa
alreadi
a
prophet
befor
he
gave
them
so
propheci
may
be
genuin
and
from
god
but
that
doe
not
make
it
scriptur
also
interest
to
note
is
that
some
so
call
propheci
are
noth
new
but
rather
an
inspir
translat
of
scriptur
is
it
right
to
call
that
propheci
mislead
wouldnt
that
be
more
have
to
do
with
knowledg
i
dont
know
about
translat
of
scriptur
but
i
am
familiar
with
propheci
that
give
applic
for
scriptur
there
are
also
similar
exampl
in
the
bibl
sever
time
peter
interpret
propheci
in
a
seemingli
prophet
way
for
exampl
and
hi
bishoprick
let
anoth
take
concern
juda
offic
a
clearer
exampl
can
be
found
in
matthew
jesu
is
prophesi
about
what
will
happen
befor
hi
return
and
he
quot
a
passag
out
of
joel
about
the
sun
be
darken
and
the
moon
turn
to
blood
so
scriptur
propheci
can
be
use
in
later
propheci
sometim
thi
sort
of
thing
can
cross
over
into
be
a
word
of
knowledg
but
gift
of
the
spirit
seem
to
overlap
word
of
knowledg
and
wisdom
can
overlap
the
word
of
knowledg
and
propheci
can
overlap
interpret
of
toung
is
veri
similar
to
propheci
heal
are
often
consid
miracl
so
sometim
the
distinct
between
gift
is
a
bit
hazi
imho
it
doesnt
usual
matter
that
much
if
we
are
abl
to
label
a
phenomenon
a
long
a
we
recogn
them
a
the
work
of
the
spirit
and
use
them
