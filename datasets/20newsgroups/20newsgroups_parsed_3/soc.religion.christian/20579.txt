here
goe
you
have
to
be
veri
care
about
what
you
mean
by
question
author
taken
liter
it
is
nonsens
that
which
is
authorat
is
authorat
and
to
say
i
question
to
word
of
thi
author
is
ridicul
if
it
is
open
to
question
it
isnt
an
author
on
the
other
hand
it
is
perfectli
reason
to
question
whether
someth
is
an
author
the
catch
phrase
here
should
be
authent
author
onc
you
have
authent
your
author
you
must
believ
what
it
say
or
you
are
not
treat
it
a
an
author
the
difficulti
is
that
authent
an
author
is
not
easi
you
can
perhap
discredit
a
claim
to
author
by
show
logic
inconsist
in
what
it
teach
or
by
show
that
it
doe
not
obey
it
own
rule
of
discours
but
the
fact
that
i
can
not
discredit
someth
doe
not
in
inself
accredit
it
nor
doe
the
fact
that
i
can
convinc
myself
and
other
that
i
have
discredit
someth
necessarilli
mean
that
it
is
fals
i
can
not
accredit
an
author
by
independantli
verifi
it
teach
becaus
if
i
can
independantli
verifi
it
teach
i
dont
need
an
author
i
need
an
author
onli
when
there
is
inform
i
need
which
i
can
not
get
for
myself
thu
if
i
am
to
authent
an
author
i
must
do
it
by
some
mean
other
than
by
examin
it
teach
in
practic
matter
we
accept
all
kind
of
author
becaus
we
dont
have
time
to
rediscov
fundament
knowledg
for
ourselv
everi
scientist
wore
today
assum
on
the
author
of
the
scintif
commun
all
sort
of
knowledg
which
is
necessari
to
hi
work
but
which
he
ha
not
time
to
verifi
for
himself
in
spiritu
matter
we
accept
author
becaus
we
have
no
direct
sourc
ofinform
we
select
our
author
base
on
variou
criterion
i
am
a
cathol
in
part
becaus
the
histor
claim
of
the
rc
church
seem
the
strongest
without
author
there
would
be
no
subject
matter
for
belief
unless
we
simpli
made
someth
up
for
ourselv
a
mani
do
the
atheist
posit
seem
to
be
that
there
are
no
author
thi
is
a
reason
assert
in
itself
but
it
lead
to
a
practic
difficulti
if
you
reject
all
author
out
of
hand
you
reject
all
possibl
of
everi
receiv
inform
thu
the
atheist
posit
can
never
possibl

it
is
nonfalsifi

therefor
unscintif
