mc
compuserv

thi
week
thought
last
week
the
suprem
court
refus
without
comment
to
hear
an
appeal
by
renssela
in
school
offici
desir
the
distribut
of
bibl
in
their
public
school
rel
a
lower
court
had
ban
the
local
gideon
an
intern
bibl
distribut
group
from
pas
out
bibl
to
fifthgrad
the
aclu
barri
lynn
wa
quot
a
say
that
the
court
action
protect
the
religi
neutral
of
our
public
school
he
also
said
that
school
must
serv
student
of
all
faith
and
none
school
were
not
to
be
a
bazaar
where
rival
religi
group
compet
for
convert
accord
to
lynn
sever
gideon
men
who
are
respons
for
put
bibl
in
hospit
and
hotel
are
member
of
our
church
they
tell
of
similar
stori
where
they
are
onli
allow
to
distribut
bibl
on
sidewalk
around
the
school
but
can
not
go
insid
the
school
they
tell
of
mild
harass
by
parent
who
do
not
want
their
child
receiv
a
bibl
from
a
stranger
they
are
will
to
continu
their
work
at
a
distanc
but
find
the
school
posit
somewhat
dishearten
i
understand
ration
and
logic
the
court
posit
and
i
can
see
the
sen
of
fair
for
all
group
but
on
the
other
hand
when
doe
neutral
becom
nihil
when
doe
plural
turn
into
no
posit
at
all
i
see
a
coupl
of
ironi
here
one
is
that
we
can
pas
out
condom
but
not
bibl
in
our
school
think
on
that
one
for
a
moment
the
other
is
that
while
we
are
seek
religi
neutral
in
our
school
countri
like
russiawho
by
the
way
practic
religi
neutral
for
the
past
seventi
yearsar
make
the
bibl
part
of
their
public
school
curriculum
when
i
wa
in
st
petersburg
in
march
the
church
we
work
with
had
train
over
public
school
teacher
to
teach
the
bibl
and
the
govern
had
request
hundr
more
i
recent
heard
a
medic
doctor
who
is
presid
of
the
gideon
chapter
in
moscow
tell
how
they
are
eagerli
invit
to
the
univers
of
moscow
to
distribut
bibl
to
the
student
and
are
given
class
time
to
explain
it
content
i
rememb
see
a
photograph
of
thi
doctor
hold
a
bibl
and
speak
to
the
univers
student
stand
under
a
statu
of
lenin
now
that
iron
i
admit
two
thing
we
are
a
pluralist
societi
and
all
faith
have
equal
foot
thi
is
what
our
countri
wa
found
on
to
allow
everi
group
on
school
ground
could
creat
a
bazaarlik
atmospher
each
citi
must
work
to
be
inclus
of
all
religion
and
provid
a
hear
for
them
i
know
i
said
twoth
vital
of
religi
faith
is
not
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
public
arena
acknowledg
it
a
valid
howeverand
you
knew

comingi
believ
disallow
the

in
