paul
adapt
the
messag
of

to
a
larg

thi
market
still
exist
today
but
do
you
count
yourself
a
part
of
it
to
be
weak
in
the
faith
is
not
miss
the
mark
hamartia
if
you
do
the
best
that
your
educ
allow
are
you
do
the
best
the
law
wa
regard
by
jew
at
the
time
and
now
a
bind
on
jew
but
not
on
gentil
there
are
rule
that
were
bind
on
all
human
be
the
socal
noachic
law
but
they
are
quit
minim
let
me
make
clear
that
the
law
is
none
other
than
the
pentateuch
of
genesi
exodu
leviticu
number
deuteronomi
what
did
jesu
say
about
the
law
in
matt
where
did
jesu
say
that
the
law
onli
appli
to
jew
and
that
gentil
are
abov
the
law
the
issu
that
the
church
had
to
face
after
jesu
death
wa
what
to
do
about
gentil
who
want
to
follow
christ
the
decis
not
to
impos
the
law
on
them
didnt
say
that
the
law
wa
abolish
it
simpli
acknowledg
that
fact
that
it
didnt
appli
to
gentil
who
acknowledg
thi
fact
on
what
basi
are
we
extrabibl
at
thi
point
whi
not
also
acknowledg
that
the
bhagavadgita
is
the
onli
relev
text
for
gentil
after
all
we
see
in
the
bibl
that
it
wa
magu
from
the
east
who
observ
the
starsign
of
jesu
whi
bother
with
ani
text
at
all
whi
not
just
follow
whatev
the
church
ha
to
say
thu
there
is
no
contradict
with
mat
i
dont
see
how
you
can
say
thi
with
a
straight
face
are
you
a
follow
of
christ
or
do
you
follow
someon
el
are
you
say
that
the
word
of
jesu
onli
appli
to
jew
a
far
a
i
can
tell
both
paul
and
other
jewish
christian
did
continu
to
particip
in
jewish
worship
on
the
sabbath
thu
they
continu
to
obey
the
law
how
jewish
wa
paul
after
he
chang
hi
name
from
saul
the
issu
wa
and
is
with
gentil
christian
who
are
not
cover
by
the
law
or
at
least
not
by
the
ceremoni
aspect
of
it
who
say
gentil
christian
are
not
cover
by
the
first
five
book
who
say
that
gentil
christian
are
abov
the
ten
command
jesu
dealt
mostli
with
jew
i
think
we
can
reason
assum
that
mat
wa
direct
to
a
jewish
audienc
your
impli
that
jesu
word
are
valid
onli
for
jew
is
thi
realli
what
you
mean
to
say
you
do
realiz
that
you
are
gut
rather
larg
portion
of
the
bibl
when
you
read
jesu
word
did
you
ever
consid
that
mayb
just
mayb
jesu
is
talk
to
you
no
matter
what
your
race
or
sex
if
the
hebrew
scriptur
and
the
gospel
account
of
jesu
are
onli
direct
to
jew
whi
were
they
translat
into
english
he
did
interact
with
gentil
a
few
time
eg
the
centurion
whose
slave
wa
heal
and
a
coupl
of
other
the
term
use
to
describ
the
centurion
see
luke
suggest
that
he
wa
a
godfear
ie
a
gentil
who
follow
god
but
had
not
adopt
the
whole
jewish
law
a
paul
would
call
him
one
who
wa
weak
in
the
faith
he
wa
commend
by
jewish
elder
a
a
worthi
person
and
jesu
accept
him
a
such
thi
seem
to
me
to
indic
that
jesu
accept
the
prevail
view
that
gentil
need
not
accept
the
law
which
is
more
import
the
record
word
of
jesu
or
indic
that
you
can
deduc
from
the
bibl
wa
jesu
god
onli
of
the
jew
or
god
of
all
humankind
of
all
race
and
sex
howev
there
more
involv
if
you
want
to
compar
jesu
and
paul
on
the
law
in
order
to
get
a
full
pictur
of
the
role
of
the
law
we
have
to
come
to
grip
with
paul
appar
reject
of
the
law
and
how
that
relat
to
jesu
commend
of
the
law
at
least
a
i
read
paul
he
say
that
the
law
serv
a
purpos
that
ha
been
in
a
certain
sen
superced
thi
is
your
understand
of
paul
compar
thi
to
the
word
of
jesu
are
you
christian
or
paulin
again
thi
issu
isnt
one
of
the
abolit
of
the
law
in
the
middl
of
hi
discus
paul
note
that
he
might
be
understood
thi
way
and
assur
u
that
that
not
what
he
intend
to
say
rather
he
see
the
law
a
primarili
be
present
to
convict
peopl
of
their
sin
but
ultim
it
an
imposs
standard
and
one
that
ha
been
superced
by
christ
again
thi
is
your
understand
of
paul
did
jesu
say
that
the
law
wa
an
imposs
standard
did
jesu
say
that
he
superced
the
law
are
you
christian
or
paulin
paul
comment
are
not
the
world
clearest
here
and
not
everyon
agre
with
my
read
you
acknowledg
that
it
is
your
read
of
paul
what
did
jesu
say
can
you
deni
that
matt
is
quit
clear
in
it
mean
are
you
christian
or
paulin
but
the
interest
thing
to
notic
is
that
even
thi
radic
posit
doe
not
entail
an
abolit
of
the
law
it
still
remain
a
an
uncompromis
standard
from
which
not
an
iota
or
dot
may
be
remov
for
it
purpos
of
convict
of
sin
it
import
that
it
not
be
relax
when
did
jesu
say
that
the
purpos
of
the
law
wa
convict
of
sin
howev
for
christian
it
not
the
end
ultim
we
live
in
faith
not
law
plea
reread
matt
are
you
christian
or
paulin
jesu
interpret
emphas
the
intent
of
the
law
and
stay
away
from
the
ceremoni
detail
are
you
say
that
the
ten
command
are
ceremoni
detail
paul
conclus
is
similar
while
he
talk
about
the
law
be
superced
all
of
the
specif
exampl
he
give
involv
the
ceremoni
law
such
a
circumcis
and
the
sabbath
he
is
quit
concern
about
maintain
moral
standard
you
call
observ
of
the
sabbath
the
day
on
which
the
lord
rest
ceremoni
ha
circumcis
been
superced
for
christian
are
you
christian
or
paulin
both
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
at
least
not
in
thi
case
jesu
did
not
deal
explicitli
with
the
question
of
whether
the
law
wa
bind
on
gentil
that
whi
i
have
to
cite
evid
such
a
the
way
jesu
dealt
with
the
centurion
a
to
gener
jewish
view
on
thi
i
am
depend
larg
on
studi
of
paulin
theolog
one
by
hj
schoep
and
one
whose
author
i
cant
come
up
with
at
the
moment
both
author
are
jew
also
variou
christian
and
nonchristian
jew
have
discus
the
issu
here
and
in
other
newsgroup
mat
is
clear
that
the
law
is
still
valid
it
doe
not
say
that
it
appli
to
gentil
and
ye
i
say
that
the
specif
requir
for
worship
on
the
sabbath
in
the
ten
command
is
a
ceremoni
detail
when
your
look
at
the
oblig
of
gentil
similarli
circumcis
im
not
sure
quit
what
el
i
can
say
on
thi
subject
again
it
unfortun
the
jesu
didnt
answer
the
question
directli
howev
we
do
know
what
the
st
cent
jewish
approach
wa
how
jesu
dealt
with
at
least
one
gentil
and
how
jesu
discipl
dealt
with
the
issu
when
it
becam
more
acut
im
refer
to
act
more
than
paul
given
that
these
are
all
in
agreement
i
dont
see
that
there
a
big
problem
clh
