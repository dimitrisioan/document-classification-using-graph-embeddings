write
in
articl
carol
alvin
write
are
all
truth
also
absolut
is
all
of
scriptur
truth
and
therefor
absolut
the
answer
to
both
question
is
ye
perhap
we
have
differ
definit
of
absolut
then
to
me
an
absolut
is
someth
that
is
constant
across
time
cultur
situat
etc
true
in
everi
instanc
possibl
do
you
agre
with
thi
definit
i
think
you
do
similarli
all
truth
is
absolut
inde
a
nonabsolut
truth
is
a
contradict
in
term
when
is
someth
absolut
when
it
is
alway
true
obvious
if
a
truth
is
not
alway
true
then
we
have
a
contradict
in
term
i
agre
with
carol
here
determin
absolut
is
practic
speak
a
wast
of
time
and
we
easili
forget
that
rel
truth
is
in
fact
rel
for
exampl
i
recent
wa
ask
some
child
the
question
what
temperatur
doe
water
boil
at
i
got
the
answer
degre
consist
i
ask
if
they
knew
what
scale
and
wa
told
it
just
degre
ani
scale
that
what
all
thermomet
say
well
that
sincer
and
may
be
true
in
the
experi
of
the
speaker
but
it
is
simpli
wrong
it
is
not
an
absolut
truth
similarli
scriptur
is
full
of
truth
which
we
should
nurtur
and
cherish
but
tri
to
determin
which
part
are
absolut
truth
and
which
part
are
the
manifest
of
that
in
the
context
of
the
time
and
cultur
in
which
the
text
wa
pen
is
miss
the
point
then
religion
easili
becom
an
intellectu
headtrip
devoid
of
the
live
experi
of
the
indwel
triniti
and
becom
dead
scholastic
imo
exampl
of
headcov
in
church
delet
thi
wa
a
good
exampl
there
may
be
an
absolut
truth
behind
the
write
but
the
simplest
understand
of
the
passag
is
that
the
instruct
appli
to
the
corinthian
and
not
necessarili
elsewher
the
instruct
may
reflect
absolut
truth
in
the
context
of
first
centuri
cultur
and
the
particular
climat
at
corinth
which
wa
have
a
lot
of
troubl
with
order
is
it
absolut
truth
to
me
no
and
i
see
no
compel
or
even
reason
reason
that
it
should
be
evangel
are
clearli
not
take
thi
particular
part
of
scriptur
to
be
absolut
truth
and
there
are
plenti
of
other
exampl
can
you
reconcil
thi
even
the
most
diehard
literalist
do
not
take
all
of
the
bibl
liter
ive
yet
to
meet
anyon
who
take
the
vers
bless
is
he
who
take
your
babi
and
smash
their
head
against
the
rock
liter
the
bibl
wa
not
print
or
hand
to
u
by
god
with
color
code
to
tell
u
what
part
should
be
interpret
which
way
mani
peopl
claim
that
there
are
no
absolut
in
the
world
such
a
statement
is
terribl
selfcontradictori
let
me
put
it
to
you
thi
way
if
there
are
no
absolut
shouldnt
we
conclud
that
the
statement
there
are
no
absolut
is
not
absolut
true
obvious
we
have
a
contradict
here
i
dont
claim
that
there
are
no
absolut
i
think
there
are
veri
few
though
and
determin
absolut
is
difficult
i
agre
veri
few
and
even
if
we
knew
them
person
we
may
not
be
abl
to
express
that
in
a
way
that
still
convey
absolut
truth
to
anoth
the
presenc
of
absenc
of
absolut
may
not
make
ani
differ
sinc
i
know
i
can
never
fulli
apprehend
an
absolut
if
it
walk
up
and
greet
me
there
is
hardli
consensu
even
in
evangel
christian
not
to
mention
the
rest
of
christian
regard
biblic
interpret
so
peopl
sometim
disagre
about
what
is
true
thi
doe
not
negat
the
fact
howev
that
there
are
still
absolut
in
the
univers
i
cant
prove
the
exist
of
absolut
i
can
onli
reli
upon
my
experi
i
also
trust
god
revel
that
we
can
not
fulli
comprehend
the
infinit
therefor
we
cant
comprehend
the
absolut
so
i
dont
need
them
i
can
never
know
the
essenc
of
god
onli
the
energi
by
and
through
which
god
is
manifest
to
god
creation
so
the
realiti
can
be
that
there
are
absolut
but
it
is
of
no
practic
import
it
like
claim
that
the
origin
scriptur
autograph
were
perfect
but
copi
may
not
be
swell
who
care
it
doesnt
affect
me
in
ani
practic
use
way
i
might
a
well
believ
that
god
ha
made
a
lot
of
electr
blue
chicken
and
that
they
live
on
mar
mayb
god
did
so
what
is
that
go
to
have
ani
effect
on
how
i
deal
with
my
neighbor
or
god
whether
or
not
i
