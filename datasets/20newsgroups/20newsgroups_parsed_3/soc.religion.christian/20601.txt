re
question
from
a
newbi
the
concept
of
god
a
a
teacher
is
inde
interest
doe
he
grade
on
a
curv
doe
he
cheat
that
is
interest
not
to
mention
thought
provok
my
own
concept
is
that
he
is
a
father
and
we
are
hi
child
in
that
he
love
u
with
a
love
that
we
can
never
understand
until
we
are
with
him
the
bibl
say
that
he
look
on
the
heart
a
the
final
measur
from
that
perspect
in
a
grade
context
the
heart
is
the
final
test
specif
most
christian
would
agre
that
there
is
onli
one
heaven
and
one
hell
from
that
perspect
it
is
heaven
or
hell
you
either
go
to
one
or
the
other
the
grade
on
a
passfail
basi
is
done
by
god
the
father
with
intervent
by
jesu
the
son
not
by
other
for
onli
god
see
the
heart
the
bibl
say
of
the
heart
who
can
know
it
i
would
say
there
ha
alway
been
and
alway
be
an
unchang
method
that
is
what
make
a
relationship
with
christ
so
secur
in
an
uncertain
and
ever
chang
landscap
he
is
alway
the
same
yesterday
today
and
tomorrow
concern
whether
or
not
our
childhood
are
considerd
a
part
of
the
test
my
own
convict
is
no
were
that
the
case
i
certainli
wouldnt
be
go
to
heaven
the
bibl
speak
veri
plainli
about
the
love
and
care
jesu
had
for
and
about
child
the
realiti
is
that
we
are
all
child
some
of
u
just
have
bigger
bodi
and
grey
hair
but
the
father
our
father
is
alway
there
like
most
father
he
want
onli
the
best
for
hi
own
there
mayb
deciplin
but
there
is
more
love
it
sometim
look
like
christian
is
a
test
to
see
who
make
it
and
who
doesnt
those
who
do
passheaven
and
those
who
dont
go
to
the
other
place
but
it
is
realli
much
more
than
that
there
are
few
expert
most
of
u
are
just
travel
look
for
the
light
and
the
way
home
pray
that
we
can
bring
other
with
u
