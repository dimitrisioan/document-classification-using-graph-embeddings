re
god
moral
and
massacr
without
quot
at
length
from
the
preceed
post
id
just
like
to
say
that
i
find
it
a
much
more
appropri
way
of
deal
with
issu
like
the
holocaust
and
bosnia
that
assert
that
god
is
punish
them
the
activ
of
god
is
alway
redempt
which
mean
restor
what
ha
been
lost
broken
or
distort
so
god
doe
not
will
the
broken
lost
distort
genocid
poverti
etc
but
is
nonetheless
capabl
will
and
activ
to
restor
heal
mend
and
redeeem
