like
to
get
your
comment
on
a
question
that
ha
been
on
my
mind
a
lot
what
moralseth
appli
to
dream
and
outofbodi
incid
in
normal
dream
you
cant
control
anyth
so
obvious
you
arent
moral
respons
for
your
action
but
if
you
can
contriv
to
control
the
action
in
dream
or
do
an
oob
it
seem
like
a
moral
appli
i
think
that
if
someon
often
ha
immor
dream
like
lust
dream
or
dream
where
you
commit
act
of
violenc
etc
etc
it
may
be
a
sign
that
he
ha
someth
sin
in
hi
heart
it
may
be
the
holi
spirit
way
of
allow
the
sin
that
is
in
u
to
come
to
light
so
that
we
can
pray
about
it
and
have
it
remov
gener
if
one
ha
a
pure
heart
and
set
hi
mind
on
thing
that
are
holi
he
will
be
holi
even
when
he
dream
dream
also
can
be
from
the
lord
joseph
and
nebucadnezzar
are
two
exampl
of
peopl
in
the
bibl
who
receiv
dream
from
the
lord
regard
out
of
bodi
experi
thi
is
someth
that
we
have
to
be
care
with
what

be
spiritu
in
natur
especi
if
what
one
saw
is
the

gener
an
out
of

some
thing
that
might
be
call
an

might
actual
be
from
the

wrote
of
what
might
of

ii
corinthian

wrote
of
a
spiritu

of
be
caught

if
god
want

he
can
do

of
hi
own

most
often
it
seem
that
