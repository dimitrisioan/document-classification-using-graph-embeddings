answer
is
that
god
is
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
sound
much
better
but
i
am
tempt
to
ask
doe
god
himself
exist
then
if
god
is
the
sourc
of
hi
own
exist
it
can
onli
mean
that
he
ha
in
term
of
human
time
alway
exist
but
thi
is
not
the
same
a
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
argument
sound
like
god
doe
not
exist
but
metaexist
and
from
hi
metaexist
perspect
he
creat
exist
i
think
thi
is
actual
a
nonsolut
a
mere
twist
of
word
alway
exist
and
be
the
sourc
of
the
exist
of
all
other
be
is
not
problemat
but
a
you
put
be
the
sourc
of
all
exist
includ
one
own
would
mean
that
god
came
from
noth
a
concept
alien
to
christian
and
theism
it
is
better
to
understand
the
classic
concept
of
necessari
and
conting
exist
god
exist
necessarili
alway
god
creat
conting
be
thi
is
a
coher
solut
to
exist
so
long
a
the
concept
of
god
is
coher
the
best
answer
i
have
heard
is
that
human
reason
is
incap
of
understand
such
question
be
an
atheist
myself
i
do
not
accept
such
answer
sinc
i
do
not
have
ani
other
method
not
a
veri
good
answer
if
reason
can
not
by
ani
mean
understand
someth
then
it
is
like
that
it
is
a
null
concept
someth
not
