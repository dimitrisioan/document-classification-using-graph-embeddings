will
believ
it
for
if

statement
onli
assert
that
that
particular
choic
wa
not
a
matter
of
karmic
fulfil
of
the
past
just
a
the
fate
of
the
man
born
blind
john
wa
not
there
is
no
question
here
of
the
simplist
idea
of
karma
a
a
machin
that
is
the
sole
determin
of
one
destini
even
the
eastern
tradit
or
mani
of
them
do
not
say
that
a
one
knowledg
poster
point
out
and
if
in
fact
that
paul
did
not
know
about
or
believ
in
reincarn
doe
not
say
anyth
one
way
or
anoth
about
it
even
john
the
baptist
who
jesu
say
emphat
is
elijah
matt
doe
not
appear
to
have
been
awar
of
it
at
least
at
the
point
at
which
he
wa
ask
but
it
is
interest
that
hi
threefold
denial
to
the
question
whether
he
is
the
christ
the
prophet
ie
isaiah
or
elijah
is
emphat
in
the
first
case
and
veri
weak
in
the
third
i
would
like
to
add
onc
again
that
while
it
is
import
to
discu
the
differ
passag
that
may
point
directli
to
the
teach
of
repeat
earth
life
one
way
or
anoth
what
i
realli
see
a
import
in
our
time
is
that
the
subject
be
revisit
in
term
of
the
larger
view
of
christian
and
christian
doctrin
for
the
most
part
those
who
do
accept
it
either
reject
the
central
idea
of
christian
or
if
they
are
christian
hold
their
convict
a
a
kind
of
separ
treasur
i
believ
that
christian
ha
import
new
understand
to
bring
to
bear
on
it
and
vice
versa
much
that
is
central
to
christian
take
on
entir
new
dimens
of
mean
in
light
of
repeat
earth
life
it
ha
a
direct

on
mani
of
the
issu
frequent
discuss
in
thi
newsgroup
in
particular
i
have
said
openli
that
i
have
develop
my
view
of
repeat
earth
life
larg
from
the
work
of
rudolf
steiner
not
that
i
hold
him
a
an
author
but
the
whole
pictur
of
christian
becom
clearer
in
light
of
these
idea

indic
that
the
old
conscious
of
reincar

necessarili
had
to
fade
away
that
it
could
be

through
the
first
two
millenia
after
