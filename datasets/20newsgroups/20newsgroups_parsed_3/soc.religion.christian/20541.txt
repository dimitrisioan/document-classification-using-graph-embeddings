were
the
earli
christian
weird
ye
so
were
their
nonchristian
contemporari
the
more
familiar
you
are
with
late
republican
rome
or
the
pricip
the
weirder
those
peopl
will
seem
forget
the
creativ
filter
done
by
renaiss
and
eighteenth
centuri
hero
worship
so
are
modern
nonchristian
and
christian
you
are
pretti
weird
yourself
with
your
rather
acid
dismiss
of
luther
and
of
protestant
and
in
appar
buy
into
a
simplist
propaganda
model
about
catholic
not
be
faddish
sure
it
so
larg
that
global
fad
take
longer
cycl
than
they
do
in
smaller
denomin

are
not

visibl
unless
you
do
a
lot
of
travel
to

may
i
recom
mend
a
a

antidot
to

nonsens
philipp
ari
book
the
hour
of

death
a
longitudin
studi
of
death
custom
in

and
it
wont
help
to
escap
into
the
obscur
of
the
first

centuri
paul
wa
pretti
weird
too
a
were
peter
and
the
other
in
the
appar
quit
weird
circl
around
jesu
what
i
think
you
might
find
help
is
a
bit
more
chariti
tri
to
understand
these
weirdo
and
nutcas
with
the
same
respect
and
love
you
would
expect
other
to
show
your
notion
we
are
command
to
love
one
anoth
after
all
and
brown
book
is
in
fact
a
heroic
attempt
to
see
the
group
he
talk
about
a
motiv
in
love
and
the
gospel
and
their
social
context
if
anyth
brown
is
too
heroic
here
he
manag
to
overstrain
himself
at
time
i
dont
suggest
that
we
follow
ani
of
these
old
cult
path
and
it
rais
hard
question
from
the
skeptic
insid
me
that
so
much
of
earli
christian
wa
like
the
weird
christian
and
nonchristian
cult
we
see
today
to
that
extent
i
think
you
rais
a
seriou
problem
and
perhap
your
phrase
is
implicitli
selfdeprecatori
and
iron
but
the
first
principl
for
answer
these
question
is
respect
and
love
for
those
we
do
not
understand
and
it
help
to
work
at
under
stand
a
long
a
we
do
not
get
overwhelm
by
revuls
and
begin
to
withdraw
our
respect
for
them
a
peopl
i
would
advis
