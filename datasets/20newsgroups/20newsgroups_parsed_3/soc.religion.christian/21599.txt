i

and
we
howev
shall
be
innoc

and
will
pray
with
earnest
entreati
and
supplic
that

also
call

to
the
church
at
ephesu
in

which
is
worthi
of
all
felicit
bless
a
it
is
with
great
by
the
full
of
god
the
father
predestin
from
all
etern
for
a
glori
that
is
last
and
unchang

and
chosen
in

suffer
by

of

st
ignatiu
bishop
of

letter

address
c
ad
we
say
therefor
that
in
substanc
in
concept
in
orgin
and
in
eminec
the
ancient
and
cathol
church
is
alon
gather
a
it
doe
into
the
uniti
of
the
one
faith
which
result
from
the
familiar
coven
those
alreadi
chosen
those
predestin
by
god
who
knew
befor
the
foundat
of
the
world
that
they
would
be
just
st
clement
patriarch
and
archbishop
of
alexandria
miscellani
c
ad
of
cours
the
doctrin
wa
explain
more
fulli
later
on
by
st
augustin
aquina
etc
but
the
seed
were
ther
from
the
begin
thi
is
realli
confus
to
me
especi
sinc
i
still
believ
that
christ
jesu
die
for
all
of
u
preknowledg
of
obstinaci
seem
like
an
aw
convolut
way
to
account
for
a
coupl
of
vers
but
i
think
you
are
read
it
wrong
i
say
those
who
are
not
save
are
not
save
on
account
of
their
own
sin
it
is
not
becaus
god
did
not
give
them
suffici
grace
for
he
doe
do
so
in
hi
desir
that
all
men
might
be
save
howev
a
onli
some
are
save
and
those
who
are
save
are
save
by
the
grace
of
god
not
by
work
lest
ani
man
should
boast
the
other
are
damn
becaus
of
their
obstinaci
in
refus
to
heed
the
call
of
god
they
are
damn
by
their
own
free
will
and
chose
a
choic
forseen
by
god
in
hi
caus
them
to
be
not
predestin
but
reprob
instead
so
god
use
grace
like
margarin
he
onli
spread
it
where
it
need
and
not
where
it
isnt
and
so
there
are
the
save
and
the
notsav
and
noth
in
between
hmmmm
certainli
god
doe
not
distribut
grace
evenli
if
he
did
no
one
could
have
their
heart
harden
or
rather
harden
their
heart
thu
caus
god
to
withdraw
hi
grace
but
you
are
correct
the
world
is
divid
into
those
who
god
know
to
be
save
and
those
god
know
to
be
on
the
road
to
perdit
the
key
is
that
god
know
it
and
we
do
not
thu
no
one
can
boast
in
complet
assur
that
they
are
one
of
the
elect
and
predestin
but
no
one
who
is
a
christian
in
good
standin
should
doubt
their
salvat
either
that
show
a
lack
of
trust
in
god
be
punish
after
we
die
your
say
what
we
get
after
we
die
ha
a
direct
bear
on
how
we
live
now
strang
you
must
admit
it
is
possibl
anyway
whi
would
you
want
someth
in
the
hear
and
know
when
you
can
reciev
fold
in
heaven
better
to
lay
up
your
treasur
in
heaven
is
what
jesu
said
thi
is
not
to
condemn
the
rich
but
simpli
to
point
out
that
those
who
are
rich
are
frequent
veri
evil
or
immor
so
god
must
give
them
their
bless
know
a
they
have
chosen
remeb
jesu
promis
tribul
in
thi
world
and
hatr
of
other
becaus
we
are
christian
he
did
not
promis
heaven
on
earth
he
promis
heaven
so
sin
is
either
punish
now
or
later
and
not
both
what
if
it
sort
of
halfpunish
are
there
ani
grey
area
in
thi
doctrin
not
realli
unless
you
do
penanc
here
on
earth
you
will
have
to
do
it
in
purgatori
a
paul
point
out
corinthian
those
with
poorer
work
though
still
done
with
good
intent
will
onli
be
save
through

the
damn
will
of
cours
go
into
fire
immeadi
for
whatev
good
they
did

not

for

the
church
give
indulg
ha
confess
and
annoint
of
the
sick
to
remov
sin
and
the
the

so
there
is
realli
littl
excus
for

it
is
a
