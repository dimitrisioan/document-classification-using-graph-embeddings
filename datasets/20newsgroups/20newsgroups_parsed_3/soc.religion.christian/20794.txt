re
when
are
two
peopl
marri
in
god
eye
i
have
a
question
for
you
all
relat
to
thi
jesu
condemn
divorc
sever
time
in
the
new
testament
and
i
have
a
hard
time
with
thi
the
cathol
church
a
far
a
i
can
tell
doe
grant
annul
with
the
statement
that
the
marriag
never
realli
exist
in
god
eye
plea
if
i
am
mistinterpret
correct
me
howev
i
have
wit
marriag
where
two
peopl
were
veri
much
in
love
but
recogn
that
they
were
destroy
themselv
and
each
other
by
stay
in
a
marriag
and
that
the
problem
were
due
to
person
childhood
issu
that
had
never
been
resolv
i
ask
you
is
divorc
justifi
in
such
a
case
they
knew
who
they
were
what
they
were
do
they
were
deepli
in
love
but
in
the
end
it
did
not
work
out
i
must
admit
that
i
dont
see
jesu
forc
them
to
live
togeth
or
even
condemn
that
they
go
and
seek
happi
with
someon
el
later
on
opinion
vera
i
am
your
clock
i
bind
unto
myself
today
vera
noy
i
am
your
religion
the
strong
name
of
the
i
own
you
triniti
no
disclaim
what
lard
st
patrick
breastplat
is
there
to
disclaim
thi
is
a
commonli
discus
question
though
it
been
long
enough
that
ill
allow
it
to
be
ask
a
you
might
expect
there
is
a
rang
of
answer
cathol
and
some
other
will
say
that
divorc
is
never
justifi
by
the
way
in
situat
where
someon
is
be
abus
or
for
other
seriou
caus
separ
is
allow
by
all
tradit
that
i
know
no
one
should
be
forc
to
stay
in
a
situat
where
they
are
in
danger
other
see
it
a
a
last
resort
in
situat
that
have
fallen
apart
badli
enough
that
the
best
we
can
hope
for
is
to
choos
the
lesser
of
evil
in
some
sen
the
difficult
legal
question
turn
out
not
to
be
divorc
but
remarriag
that
becaus
of
jesu
statement
in
mark
and
par
a
with
so
mani
other
thing
thi
turn
on
your
approach
to
the
bibl
conserv
protest
tend
to
see
statement
like
thi
a
have
no
except
more
liber
one
are
will
to
make
allow
for
situat
where
a
liter
interpret
would
lead
to
pain
result
it
is
note
that
at
the
time
it
wa
possibl
for
a
man
to
divorc
hi
wife
almost
on
a
whim
thu
a
common
explan
in
the
more
liber
approach
is
that
jesu
wa
tri
to
protect
peopl
from
thi
sort
of
thing
not
to
establish
an
absolut
rule
to
which
there
could
never
be
except
cathol
a
is
typic
with
cathol
ethic
take
a
theoret
hard
line
but
allow
for
except
in
practic
through
the
process
of
anul
in
the
last
discus
most
of
our
noncathol
reader
seem
to
accept
with
some
reluct
that
in
some
case
there
might
be
no
good
altern
but
there
wa
a
feel
that
the
church
should
often
be
do
a
better
job
of
help
peopl
prepar
for
marriag
and
deal
with
problem
that
come
up
dure
it
and
that
in
a
properli
run
church
divorc
should
not
be
necessari
