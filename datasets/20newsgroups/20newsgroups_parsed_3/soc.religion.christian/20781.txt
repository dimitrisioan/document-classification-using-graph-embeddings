liter
interpret
of
the
bibl
will
have
a
problem
with
thi
view
sinc
the
bibl
talk
about
the
fire
of
hell
and
such
thi
is
someth
ive
alway
found
confus
if
all
your
nerv
end
die
with
your
physic
bodi
whi
would
flame
hurt
you
how
can
one
wail
and
gnash
teeth
with
no
lung
and
no
teeth
one
can
feel
physic
pain
by
have
a
bodi
which
if
you
know
the
doctrin
of
the
resurrect
of
the
bodi
is
what
peopl
will
have
after
the
great
judgement
we
look
for
the
resurrect
of
the
dead
and
the
life
of
the
world
to
come
niceneconstantinopolitan
creed
you
will
have
both
bodi
and
soul
in
hell
eventu
now
thi
is
get
interest
i
wa
rais
roman
cathol
befor
becom
an
atheist
so
i
have
state
thi
creed
you
quot
nearli
everi
sunday
until
i
wa
about
for
some
reason
i
alway
took
the
resurrect
in
thi
statement
to
mean
the
resurrect
of
the
soul
but
i
guess
resurrect
doe
strictli
mean
the
rais
of
the
physic
bodi
i
have
some
question
on
thi
point
i
alway
thought
that
christian
believ
the
descent
into
hell
wa
pretti
much
immedi
and
that
there
are
peopl
burn
in
hell
right
now
you
seem
to
be
impli
that
it
will
not
occur
until
after
the
great
judgement
which
i
read
a
mean
the
proverbi
judgment
day
i
wa
alway
a
littl
confus
on
thi
point
even
when
i
wa
with
the
church
mayb
someon
can
clear
it
up
for
me
where
will
my
soul
which
by
the
way
i
dont
believ
in
exist
until
that
time
will
the
new
bodi
i
will
have
be
creat
out
of
the
same
atom
that
my
bodi
now
is
made
of
or
will
it
be
built
from
scratch
my
physic
bodi
now
is
suscept
to
age
etc
so
i
guess
my
new
bodi
will
have
to
be
radic
differ
in
order
to
be
immort
so
it
can
be
tortur
for
all
etern
sinc
i
will
have
a
physic
bodi
i
assum
it
will
need
a
physic
place
to
exist
in
where
is
thi
hell
in
the
center
of
the
earth
do
you
think
we
could
find
it
if
we
dig
mark
schnitziu
univ
of
central
florida
there
is
not
complet
agreement
on
the
detail
of
the
afterlif
i
think
the
most
common
view
is
that
final
disposit
doe
not
occur
until
a
final
judgement
which
is
still
in
the
futur
in
the
meantim
some
believ
that
peopl
sleep
until
the
final
resurrect
or
becaus
god
is
abov
time
pas
directli
from
death
to
the
futur
time
when
the
resurrect
occur
while
other
believ
that
soul
have
a
disembodi
preresurrect
exist
until
then
there
are
probabl
other
altern
that
im
omit
the
new
bodi
is
gener
conceiv
of
be
implement
in
a
differ
technolog
than
the
current
one
one
which
is
not
mortal
paul
talk
about
the
mortal
be
rais
to
immort
and
jesu
resurrect
bodi
which
is
the
first
exampl
clearli
wa
not
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
limit
a
our
it
is
assum
that
there
are
enough
similar
that
peopl
will
recogn
each
other
but
i
dont
think
most
peopl
claim
to
know
the
detail
i
dont
think
id
say
it
the
same
atom
id
assum
there
would
be
some
analog
of
a
physic
place
but
i
wouldnt
expect
to
find
it
under
the
earth
or
up
in
the
sky
id
suspect
that
it
in
anoth
dimens
outsid
thi
physic
world
or
whatev
but
again
we
have
littl
in
the
way
of
detail
