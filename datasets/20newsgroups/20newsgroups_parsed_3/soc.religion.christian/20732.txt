hell
in
tim
ask
i
have
state
befor
that
i
do
not
consid
myself
an
atheist
but
definit
do
not
believ
in
the
christian
god
the
recent
discuss
about
atheist
and
hell
combin
with
a
post
to
anoth
group
to
the
effect
of
you
will
all
go
to
hell
ha
me
interest
in
the
consensu
a
to
how
a
god
might
judg
men
a
a
cathol
i
wa
told
that
a
jew
buddhist
etc
might
go
to
heaven
but
obvious
some
peopl
do
not
believ
thi
even
more
see
atheist
and
pagan
i
assum
i
would
be
lump
into
thi
categori
to
be
hellbound
i
know
you
believ
onli
god
can
judg
and
i
do
not
ask
you
to
just
for
your
opinion
thi
is
probabl
too
simplist
for
some
but
john
sau
for
god
so
love
the
world
that
he
gave
hi
onli
son
that
whoever
belief
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
etern
life
genesi
and
he
abram
believ
the
lord
and
he
reckon
it
to
him
a
righteous
i
dont
find
anywher
that
god
restrict
heaven
to
particular
ethnic
group
or
religi
denomin
or
ani
other
categori
that
we
human
like
to
drop
peopl
into
but
he
doe
requir
that
we
believ
and
trust
him
in
hebrew
it
say
that
god
spoke
of
old
by
the
prophet
the
old
testament
but
in
these
last
day
he
ha
spoken
to
u
by
hi
son
jesu
christ
and
we
learn
of
him
through
the
page
of
the
new
testament
the
bibl
tell
u
what
we
need
to
believ
for
those
who
have
never
heard
i
leav
them
in
god
capabl
care
he
will
make
himself
known
a
he
desir
it
behoov
each
one
of
u
to
act
upon
the
knowledg
we
have
if
you
reject
the
claim
of
jesu
and
still
go
to
heaven
then
the
joke
on
me
if
you
reject
him
and
go
to
hell
that
no
joke
but
it
will
be
final
gerri
the
opinion
express
are
not
necessarili
those
of
my
employ
