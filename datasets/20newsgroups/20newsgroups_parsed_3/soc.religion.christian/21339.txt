write
i
have
a
simpl
test
i
take
sever
peopl
who
can
speak
onli
one
languag
eg
chines
russian
german
english
then
i
let
the
gift
one
start
speak
in
toungu
the
audienc
should
understand
the
gift
one
clearli
in
their
nativ
languag
howev
the
gift
one
can
onli
hear
himself
speak
in
hi
own
languag
that
would
be
neat
but
nowher
in
the
bibl
doe
it
say
that
one
who
ha
the
gift
of
toung
can
do
thi
if
the
gift
of
toung
were
the
abil
to
be
understood
by
everyon
no
matter
what
languag
they
know
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
gift
of
interpret
and
i
corinthian
would
not
have
had
to
have
been
written
perhap
i
would
believ
the
gift
one
more
if
they
were
glorifi
god
rather
than
themselv
then
perhap
wed
wit
a
real
miracl
that
a
pretti
harsh
assumpt
to
make
about
a
sever
million
christian
world
wide
sure
there
are
some
who
want
glori
for
themselv
who
speak
in
toung
just
a
there
are
among
those
who
do
not
have
thi
gift
there
were
peopl
like
thi
in
the
corinthian
church
also
that
doe
not
mean
that
there
is
no
true
gift
or
that
all
who
speak
in
toung
do
it
for
their
own
glori
in
the
sight
of
men
i
would
ventur
to
say
that
a
larg
percentag
of
those
who
do
speak
in
toung
do
so
more
often
in
privat
prayer
than
in
public
link
hudson
there
were
appar
those
in
the
earli
church
who
claim
that
at
pentecost
the
miracl
wa
that
the
crowd
were
all
given
the
abil
to
understand
the
apostl
