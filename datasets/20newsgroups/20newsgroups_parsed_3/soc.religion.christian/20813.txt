more
abli
that
i
could

done
so
so
i
will
confin
myself
to
answer
the
charg
of
illog
in
a
previou
articl
geno
say
if
i
dont
think
my
belief
is
right
and
everyon
el
belief
is
wrong
then
i
dont
have
a
belief
thi
is
simpli
what
belief
mean
unfortunatli
thi
seem
to
be
how
christian
are
taught
to
think
when
it
come
to
their
religion
thi
is
how
everyon
in
the
western
intellectu
tradit
is
or
wa
taught
to
think
it
is
the
fundament
premi
a
is
not
nota
if
a
thing
is
true
then
it
convers
is
necessarilli
fals
without
thi
basic
asumpt
theolog
and
scienc
a
we
know
them
are
alik
imposs
we
should
distinguish
the
strong
and
weak
mean
of
the
word
believ
howev
the
weak
sens
mean
i
am
not
sure
i
believ
tom
went
to
the
librari
but
he
could
have
gone
to
the
track
the
strong
sens
mean
i
am
so
certain
that
i
use
it
a
a
basi
of
thought
i
believ
that
natur
oper
accord
to
certain
fundament
law
despit
the
fact
that
natur
appear
caprici
and
unpredict
christian
belief
is
of
the
strong
kind
though
christian
may
well
hold
belief
of
the
weak
kind
on
ani
number
of
theolog
and
ecclesiolog
topic
some
take
it
to
the
extrem
and
say
that
their
religion
is
the
onli
one
and
if
you
dont
accept
their
teach
then
you
wont
be
save
note
that
these
are
two
separ
idea
most
hold
the
first
view
but
the
major
do
not
hold
the
second
is
is
again
a
matter
of
pure
logic
that
if
christan
is
true
then
hinduism
for
exampl
must
necessarilli
be
fals
insofar
a
it
contradict
or
is
incompat
with
christaian
and
a
a
matter
of
logic
vice
versa
it
take
quit
a
bit
of
arrog
to
claim
to
know
what
god
thinkswant
it
is
arrog
to
claim
to
know
what
anyon
think
or
want
unless
they
have
told
you
christian
believ
god
ha
told
u
what
he
think
and
want
especi
when
it
base
upon
your
interpret
of
a
book
most
christian
do
not
base
their
belief
on
the
bibl
but
on
the
live
tradit
of
the
church
establish
by
christ
and
guid
constantli
by
the
holi
spirit
the
bibl
is
simpli
the
written
core
of
that
tradit
the
logic
in
the
abov
statement
is
faulti
in
that
it
assum
two
peopl
with
differ
belief
cant
both
be
correct
if
depend
what
you
mean
by
differ
if
i
believ
tom
is
six
foot
tall
and
you
believ
he
weigh
pound
our
belief
differ
but
we
may
both
be
right
if
i
believ
tom
is
six
foot
tall
and
you
beleiv
that
he
is
four
foot
nine
one
of
u
at
least
must
be
wrong
it
all
about
percept
no
two
peopl
are
exactli
alik
no
two
peopl
perceiv
everyth
in
the
same
way
i
believ
that
there
is
one
truth
call
it
god
truth
a
univers
truth
or
call
it
what
you
will
i
dont
believ
god
present
thi
truth
i
think
it
is
just
there
and
it
up
to
you
to
look
for
and
see
it
through
prayer
medit
inspir
ation
dream
or
whatev
just
becaus
peopl
may
perceiv
thi
truth
differ
it
doesnt
mean
one
is
wrong
and
the
other
is
right
thu
you
believ
that
there
is
a
singl
truth
but
that
no
human
be
can
find
it
you
assert
that
anyon
who
believ
that
we
can
find
absolut
truth
is
mistaken
in
short
you
believ
that
anyon
who
doe
not
share
your
belief
on
thi
point
is
wrong
qed
a
an
exampl
take
the
question
is
the
glass
half
empti
or
half
full
you
can
have
two
differ
answer
which
are
contradictori
and
yet
both
are
correct
so
for
your
belief
to
be
true
doe
not
requir
everyon
el
belief
to
be
wrong
here
i
begin
to
suspect
that
your
real
difficulti
is
not
with
the
knowabl
of
truth
but
simpli
with
languag
say
that
the
glass
is
half
empti
is
not
a
contradict
of
the
statement
that
it
is
half
full
it
is
the
same
fact
express
in
differ
word
the
whole
point
of
thi
phrase
is
to
illustr
the
differ
way
the
pessimist
and
the
optimist
express
the
same
fact
it
is
of
cours
quit
true
that
differ
peopl
may
express
the
same
belief
in
differ
word
it
is
also
true
that
they
may
fail
to
understand
each
other
word
a
express
of
the
same
belief
and
may
argu
bitterli
and
believ
that
they
are
mile
apart
great
scism
have
occur
in
just
thi
way
and
much
ecumen
work
ha
been
done
simpli
in
resolv
differ
in
languag
which
conceal
agreement
in
belief
thi
doe
not
mean
in
ani
sens
that
all
belief
are
equal
valid
sinc
some
of
the
belief
peopl
hold
contradict
some
other
belief
that
other
peopl
hold
after
all
obfusc
of
languag
and
cultur
in
the
express
of
those
belief
have
been
strip
away
some
of
the
belief
that
some
peopl
hold
must
necessarilli
be
fals
and
it
is
neither
arrog
nor
illog
to
say
so
if
i
believ
x
and
you
believ
y
we
may
both
be
correct
but
if
y
is
equival
to
notx
then
one
of
u
is
wrong
and
a
long
a
we
hold
our
respect
belief
we
must
each
regard
the
other
