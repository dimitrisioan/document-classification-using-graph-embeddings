last
sunday
palm
sunday
we
went
to
the
local
church
usual
on
palm
sunday
the
congreg
particip
in
read
the
passion
take
the
role
of
the
mob
the
theolog
behind
thi
seem
profoundwhen
we
say
crucifi
him
we
mean
it
we
did
it
and
if
he
came
back
today
wed
do
it
again
it
alway
give
me
chill
but
last
week
we
were
invit
to
sit
dure
the
gospel
passion
and
listen
besid
the
orwellian
invit
on
palm
sunday
at
our
parish
we
were
invit
to
take
the
role
of
jesu
in
the
passion
i
declin
to
particip
last
year
at
the
liturgi
meet
i
point
out
how
we
crucifi
christ
by
our
sin
so
therefor
it
is
appropri
that
we
retain
the
role
of
the
crowd
but
to
no
avail
musician
reader
and
so
on
new
thing
are
introduc
in
the
cours
of
the
liturgi
and
sinc
no
one
know
what
happen
the
new
thing
have
to
be
explain
and
pretti
soon
instead
of
do
a
lot
of
the
mass
were
just
sit
there
listen
or
space
out
in
my
case
to
how
the
mass
is
about
to
be
done
in
my
mind
i
lay
the
blame
on
liturgi
committe
made
up
of
lay
expert
but
that
may
not
be
just
i
do
think
that
a
liturgi
committe
ha
a
bia
toward
do
someth
rather
than
nothingthat
just
a
fact
of
bureaucrat
lifeeven
though
a
simpler
liturgi
may
in
fact
make
it
easier
for
peopl
to
be
awar
of
the
lord
presenc
a
a
member
of
a
liturgi
committe
i
can
tell
you
that
the
problem
is
certain
peopl
domin
who
want
to
tri
out
all
kind
of
innov
the
priest
dont
seem
even
to
want
to
make
ani
decis
of
their
own
in
mani
case
i
guess
it
easier
to
tri
someth
new
than
it
is
to
refus
to
allow
it
at
our
parish
on
holi
thursday
instead
of
the
priest
wash
foot
who
want
to
get
around
peopl
foot
accord
to
one
of
our
priest
the
congreg
wa
invit
to
come
up
and
help
wash
one
anoth
hand
the
symbol
of
thi
action
distress
me
and
again
i
refus
to
particip
i
thought
that
if
we
were
to
have
to
come
up
with
rubric
for
thi
liturg
action
ie
bodi
of
christ
amen
for
receiv
communion
that
they
could
be
i
am
not
respons
for
the
blood
of
thi
man
also
for
part
of
the
eucharist
prayer
bless
are
you
god
of
all
creation
wa
substitut
some
text
read
by
a
lay
coupl
the
priest
certainli
should
not
have
given
thi
part
of
the
mass
over
to
other
and
i
wa
so
disturb
that
i
declin
to
receiv
communion
that
night
we
arent
requir
to
anyway
i
instead
offer
up
prayer
for
our
priest
and
parish
so
weve
been
wonderingar
we
the
oddbal
or
is
the
qualiti
of
the
mass
go
down
i
dont
mean
that
faceti
we
go
to
mass
everi
thursday
or
friday
and
are
remind
of
the
power
of
a
veri
simpl
liturgi
to
make
u
awar
of
god
presenc
but
a
far
a
the
obligatori
sunday
massesmayb
i
should
just
offer
it
up
ha
anyon
els
notic
declin
congreg
particip
in
cathol
mass
late
the
qualiti
of
the
mass
ha
not
chang
again
if
it
were
to
be
celebr
accord
to
the
rubric
set
down
by
the
church
it
would
still
be
liturg
beauti
the
problem
come
about
from
peopl
tri
to
be
creativ
who
are
not
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
on
particip
could
be
that
given
by
father
peter
stravinska
in
answer
to
the
question
pose
by
the
titl
of
thoma
day
whi
cathol
cant
sing
they
dont
want
to
becaus
of
all
thi
nonsens
by
the
way
for
ani
noncathol
read
thi
the
problem
doe
not
reflect
bad
liturgi
by
the
cathol
church
but
by
those
who
are
disobedi
to
the
church
in
chang
it
on
their
own
