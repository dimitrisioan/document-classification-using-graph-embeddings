to
be
sex
outsid
of
marriag
is
thi
an
accur
definit
is
there
ani
such
thing
a
samesex
marriag
in
the
bibl
my
understand
ha
alway
been
that
the
new
testament
bless
sexual
intercours
onli
between
a
husband
and
hi
wife
i
am
howev
will
to
listen
to
scriptur
evid
to
the
contrari
you
shall
not
lie
with
a
male
a
one
lie
with
a
femal
it
is
an
abomin
also
you
shall
not
have
intercours
with
ani
anim
to
be
defil
with
it
nor
shall
ani
woman
stand
befor
an
anim
to
mate
with
it
it
is
a
pervers
lev
i
notic
that
the
vers
forbid
bestial
immedi
follow
the
vers
prohibit
what
appear
to
be
homosexu
intercours
i
know
of
no
new
testament
passag
that
clearli
condemn
or
even
mention
intercours
with
anim
do
those
who
argu
for
the
legitimaci
of
homosexu
intercours
believ
that
the
bibl
condemn
bestial
a
a
pervers
and
if
so
whi
that
is
what
vers
would
you
cite
to
prove
that
bestial
wa
pervert
and
sin
could
the
vers
you
cite
be
refut
by
interpret
them
differ
can
one
be
a
christian
zoophil
by
the
way
i
myself
am
subject
to
sexual
desir
that
i
did
not
choos
to
have
and
that
mani
peopl
would
regard
a
pervert
and
sin
so
plea
understand
that
i
am
not
ask
these
question
out
of
an
antipathi
toward
my
fellow
peopl
of
altern
orient
i
do
believ
howev
that
one
should
read
the
bibl
with
an
attitud
of
what
is
the
bibl
tri
to
say
and
not
what
do
i
want
the
bibl
to
say
i
choos
not
to
give
in
to
my
pervert
sexual
desir
becaus
i
believ
the
bibl
tri
to
tell
me
whether
i
like
it
or
not
that
such
thing
are
sin
it
is
frustrat
at
time
and
i
have
had
day
where
it
realli
got
me
down
but
i
dont
blame
god
for
thi
i
blame
the
sin
itself
mark
there
some
ambigu
about
the
mean
of
the
word
in
the
passag
you
quot
both
liber
and
conserv
sourc
seem
to
agre
that
homosexu
is
not
the
gener
term
for
homosexu
but
is
like
to
have
a
mean
like
homosexu
prostitut
that
doesnt
meant
that
i
think
all
the
biblic
evid
vanish
but
the
natur
of
the
evid
is
such
that
you
cant
just
quot
one
vers
and
solv
thing
i
think
your
argument
from
fornic
is
circular
whi
is
homosexu
wrong
becaus
it
fornic
whi
is
it
fornic
becaus
theyr
not
marri
whi
arent
they
marri
becaus
the
church
refus
to
do
a
marriag
ceremoni
whi
doe
the
church
refus
to
do
a
marriag
ceremoni
becaus
homosexu
is
wrong
in
order
to
break
the
circl
there
got
to
be
some
other
reason
to
think
homosexu
is
wrong
