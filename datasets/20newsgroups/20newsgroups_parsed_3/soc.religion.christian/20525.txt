known
to
you
brother
the
gospel
which
i
preach
to
you
which
also
you
receiv
in
which
also
you
stand
by
which
also
you
are
save
if
you
hold
fast
the
word
which
i
preach
to
you
unless
you
believ
in
vain
for
i
deliv
to
you
a
of
first
import
what
i
also
receiv
that
christ
die
for
our
sin
accord
to
the
scriptur
and
that
he
wa
buri
and
that
he
wa
rais
on
the
third
day
accord
to
the
scriptur
and
that
he
appear
to
cepha
then
to
the
twelv
after
that
he
appear
to
more
than
five
hundr
brother
at
one
time
most
of
whom
remain
until
now
but
some
have
fallen
asleep
then
he
appear
to
jame
then
to
all
the
apostl
and
last
of
all
a
it
were
to
one
untim
born
he
appear
to
me
also
for
i
am
the
least
of
the
apostl
who
am
not
fit
to
be
call
an
apostl
becaus
i
persecut
the
church
of
god
but
by
the
grace
of
god
i
am
what
i
am
and
hi
grace
toward
me
did
not
prove
vain
but
i
labor
even
more
than
all
of
them
yet
not
i
but
the
grace
of
god
with
me
whether
then
it
wa
i
or
they
so
we
preach
and
so
you
believ
now
if
christ
is
preach
that
he
ha
been
rais
from
the
dead
how
do
some
among
you
say
that
there
is
no
resurrect
of
the
dead
but
if
there
is
no
resurrect
of
the
dead
not
even
christ
ha
been
rais
and
if
christ
ha
not
been
rais
then
our
preach
is
vain
your
faith
also
is
vain
moreov
we
are
even
found
to
be
fals
wit
of
god
becaus
we
wit
against
god
that
he
rais
christ
whom
he
did
not
rais
if
in
fact
the
dead
are
not
rais
for
if
the
dead
are
not
rais
not
even
christ
ha
been
rais
and
if
christ
ha
not
been
rais
your
faith
is
worthless
you
are
still
in
your
sin
then
those
also
who
have
fallen
asleep
in
christ
have
perish
if
we
have
hope
in
christ
in
thi
life
onli
we
are
of
all
men
most
to
be
piti
but
now
christ
ha
been
rais
from
the
dead
the
first
fruit
of
those
who
are
asleep
for
sinc
by
a
man
came
death
by
a
man
also
came
the
resurrect
of
the
dead
for
a
in
adam
all
die
so
also
in
christ
all
shall
be
made
aliv
but
each
in
hi
own
order
christ
the
first
fruit
after
that
those
who
are
christ
at
hi
come
then
come
the
end
when
he
deliv
up
the
kingdom
to
the
god
and
father
when
he
ha
abolish
all
rule
and
all
author
and
power
for
he
must
reign
until
he
ha
put
all
