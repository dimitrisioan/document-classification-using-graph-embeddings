need
ok
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
all
thi
out
concis
i
am
on
an
inform
gather
ventur
regard
the
variou
express
of
christianitychurch
there
are
my
husband
and
i
come
from
veri
differ
but
complet
christian
background
i
wa
a
lutheran
when
i
met
him
and
he
wa
a
born
and
rais
church
of
christ
member
at
first
i
agre
with
a
lot
of
what
the
c
of
c
wa
about
i
want
to
move
from
the
liturg
base
lutheran
church
to
someth
a
littl
more
biblic
base
howev
over
the
last
year
ive
been
regret
chang
to
the
church
of
christ
for
a
number
of
reason
for
one
thing
i
am
not
a
fundamentalist
and
believ
that
a
few
thing
in
the
bibl
are
sociocultur
in
natur
and
dont
relat
to
the
christian
doctrin
one
of
my
sorest
spot
is
the
role
of
woman
i
believ
that
through
mari
and
other
woman
chri
valid
woman
a
worthi
discipl
but
in
the
c
of
c
the
write
of
paul
are
taken
without
except
and
i
am
told
that
i
am
not
an
equal
partner
in
my
marriag
but
the
lesser
member
i
am
to
submit
to
my
husband
in
all
thing
if
i
hear
that
vers
one
more
time
and
i
am
not
to
take
an
activ
role
in
anyth
which
might
be
constru
a
put
me
in
author
over
men
ie
lead
prayer
conduct
bibl
studi
etc
the
last
straw
wa
when
the
elder
at
our
church
came
down
on
one
of
our
colleg
group
becaus
it
wa
allwomen
and
they
want
a
man
to
lead
the
studi
also
my
husband
and
i
realli
resent
the
way
everyon
at
our
church
feel
that
if
you
arent
a
conserv
republican
you
arent
a
real
christian
i
got
told
that
nobodi
who
vote
for
clinton
should
call
themselv
a
christian
henc
we
are
subject
dure
the
servic
to
long
prayer
call
for
thing
we
flatli
dont
agre
with
we
are
also
dont
agre
with
the
c
of
c
dread
of
ani
new
movement
be
led
by
the
young
peopl
so
we
have
been
church
hunt
with
no
success
i
want
a
reason
biblic
base
church
where
woman
are
view
a
whole
peopl
no
matter
what
their
call
c
of
c
realli
look
down
on
career
woman
christoph
is
look
for
a
church
with
deepli
root
religi
convict
with
adult
baptism
and
a
church
where
the
member
still
bring
their
bibl
to
servic
we
are
so
confus
here
and
were
drift
around
tri
to
find
a
place
where
we
both
feel
love
and
can
express
our
faith
honestli
and
without
reserv
if
anyon
can
point
u
in
a
direct
wed
be
thrill
im
afraid
that
it
will
be
veri
hard
for
me
to
go
back
to
c
of
c
and
even
harder
for
me
to
stay
churchless
for
long

be
welcom

would
think
somewher
in

you
might
find

probabl
more
