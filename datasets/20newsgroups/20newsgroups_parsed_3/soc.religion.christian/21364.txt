thi
and
i
believ
you
dan
when
you
say
that
you
dont
mean
to
offend
for
u
ld
templ
goer
the
templ
ceremoni
are
veri
sacr
so
much
so
that
anyon
who
go
there
promis
never
to
divulg
them
so
how
much
can
you
trust
someon
who
is
tell
you
about
the
cerermoni
one
thing
i
dont
understand
is
whi
be
sacr
should
make
the
templ
ritual
secret
there
are
lot
of
sacr
thing
in
christian
includ
the
sacr
scriptur
themselv
but
there
is
noth
secret
about
these
thing
is
it
appropri
for
the
lord
not
to
reveal
certain
thing
befor
the
world
ie
publish
them
wide
these
thing
sacr
to
himself
he
may
place
ani
pre
or
postcondit
he
feel
are
necessari
moreov
there
are
preced
in
scriptur
where
knowledg
of
sacr
thing
is
withheld
after
the
transfigur
jesu
instruct
peter
jame
and
john
to
tell
the
vision
to
no
man
until
the
son
of
man
be
risen
again
from
the
dead
matt
if
we
were
live
at
the
time
of
savior
there
would
be
no
public
record
of
thi
event
a
faith
friend
of
paul
experi
a
vision
of
paradis
when
he
heard
unspeak
word
which
it
is
not
law
for
a
man
to
utter
cor
thi
person
heard
someth
which
paul
can
not
write
to
the
corinthian
and
u
there
is
an
incid
record
in
the
book
of
mormon
where
word
utter
by
babe
were
forbidden
that
there
should
not
ani
man
write
them
nephi
the
entir
text
follow
for
those
of
you
without
access
to
the
bom
nephi
behold
it
came
to
pa
on
the
morrow
that
the
multitud
gather
themselv
togeth
and
they
both
saw
and
heard
these
child
yea
even
babe
did
open
their
mouth
and
utter
marvel
thing
and
the
thing
which
they
did
utter
were
forbidden
that
there
should
not
ani
man
write
them
some
ld
scholar
specul
that
these
word
which
could
not
be
written
are
the
sacr
portion
from
templ
we
are
to
withhold
from
the
world
but
it
could
be
someth
els
i
can
understand
whi

faith
mormon
but
i
have
never
understood

emphasi
on

can
discu
about
the
templ
ordin
we
can
discu
