re
did
he
realli
rise
in
articl
write
the
basic
problem
with
your
argument
is
your
total
and
complet
relianc
on
the
biblic
text
luke
account
is
highli
suspect
i
would
refer
you
to
the
hermeneia
commentari
on
act
in
articl
john
ata
write
even
if
there
wa
no
independ
proof
that
luke
account
wa
valid
i
find
it
strang
that
you
would
take
the
negat
of
it
a
truth
without
ani
direct
histor
evid
at
least
that
youv
mention
to
back
it
up
the
assert
wa
made
unequivoc
that
no
christian
ever
suffer
for
their
faith
by
believ
in
the
resurrect
luke
account
suggest
otherwis
and
in
the
absenc
of
direct
eyewit
who
can
claim
that
luke
is
mistaken
then
i
suggest
that
thi
unequivoc
assert
is
suspect
john
the
problem
here
is
that
you
have
taken
one
peic
of
my
respons
without
bother
to
connect
it
with
the
other
part
i
have
repeatedli
note
that
one
need
to
take
the
problemat
historc
of
act
and
then
examin
the
work
of
john
domin
crossan
and
burton
mack
onc
you
have
taken
the
time
to
examin
recent
develop
in
biblic
scholarship
i
think
you
will
grasp
more
clearli
what
i
am
say
i
think
the
origin
claim
may
have
been
somewhat
more
limit
than
thi
it
wa
an
answer
to
the
claim
that
the
wit
couldnt
be
lie
becaus
they
were
willign
to
suffer
for
their
belief
thu
it
not
necessari
to
show
that
no
christian
ever
suffer
for
believ
in
the
resurrect
rather
the
issu
is
whether
those
who
wit
it
did
i
do
agre
that
the
post
your
respond
to
show
that
there
can
be
liber
a
well
a
conserv
dogmat
clh
certainli
thi
is
an
issu
a
i
think
the
situat
in
waco
show
most
clearli
if
all
that
is
requir
is
that
peopl
are
will
to
die
for
a
belief
for
it
to
be
true
then
sure
david
koresh
is
the
son
of
god
no
the
spurriou
arguement
that
the
resurrect
had
to
be
true
for
peopl
to
be
will
to
die
must
be
put
to
rest
the
other
problem
is
that
it
is
so
monologocentr
even
if
the
resurrect
wa
a
big
deal
which
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
for
either
q
thoma
or
even
john
to
a
certain
degre
there
are
a
lot
of
other
thing
which
the
earli
christian
could
have
been
do
togeth
that
would
have
been
worth
die
for
it
is
my
belief
that
even
the
idea
of
a
mix
race
commun
which
brought
down
regionaln
boundari
in
the
name
of
koinonia
could
have
been
enough
for
peopl
to
be
will
to
die
radic
communti
do
that
eg
jonestown
waco
warsaw
etc
but
my
origin
point
wa
that
roman
persecut
which
is
the
onli
persecut
we
have
document
proof
of
wa
not
about
whether
a
carpent
came
back
from
the
dead
such
a
claim
wa
not
uniqu
nor
particularli
abhor
to
the
roman
or
greek
mind
my
point
is
that
avoid
of
militari
and
civic
duti
ie
emperor
worship
would
have
been
much
more
problemat
which
ha
noth
to
do
with
the
resurrect
at
all
when
nero
use
christian
a
human
torch
to
light
up
hi
dinner
parti
it
wasnt
becaus
the
believ
in
a
risen
savior
it
wa
becaus
they
were
supposedli
involv
in
incest
and
cannabl
the
argument
that
christian
were
martyr
for
the
resurrect
just
can
not
stand
up
to
critic
examin
randi
