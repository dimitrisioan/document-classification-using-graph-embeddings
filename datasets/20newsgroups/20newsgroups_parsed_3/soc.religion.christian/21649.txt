consid
some
sin
ill
leav
it
unnam
sinc
i
dont
want
thi
to
digress
into
an
argument
a
to
whether
or
not
someth
is
a
sin
now
let
appli
our
hate
the
sin
philosophi
and
see
what
happen
if
we
truli
hate
the
sin
then
the
more
we
see
it
the
stronger
our
hatr
of
it
will
becom
eventu
thi
hate
becom
so
strong
that
we
becom
disgust
with
the
sinner
and
eventu
come
to
hate
the
sinner
though
you
can
certaili
assert
all
thi
i
dont
see
whi
it
necessarili
ha
to
be
the
case
whi
cant
hate
just
stay
a
it
is
and
not
beget
more
who
say
we
have
to
get
disgust
and
start
hate
the
sinner
i
admit
thi
happen
but
i
donlt
think
you
can
say
it
is
alway
necessaili
so
whi
can
we
not
hate
with
a
perfect
hatr
in
the
summari
of
the
law
christ
command
u
to
love
god
and
to
love
our
neighbor
he
doesnt
say
anyth
about
hate
in
fact
if
anyth
he
command
u
to
save
our
critic
for
ourselv
so
how
are
christian
suppos
to
deal
with
the
sin
of
other
i
suppos
that
there
is
onli
one
way
to
deal
with
sin
either
in
other
or
ourselvesthrough
prayer
we
certainli
we
should
love
even
our
enemi
amo
say
to
hate
the
evil
and
love
the
good
thi
cant
contradict
christ
teach
i
think
we
tie
up
both
hate
and
love
with
an
emot
attitud
when
it
realli
should
be
consid
more
object
sure
i
dont
fli
into
a
rage
at
everi
sin
i
see
but
whi
can
i
not
hate
it
