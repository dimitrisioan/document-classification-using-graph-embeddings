are
all
truth
also
absolut
is
all
of
scriptur
truth
and
therefor
absolut
if
the
answer
to
either
of
these
question
is
no
then
perhap
you
can
explain
to
me
how
you
determin
which
part
of
scriptur
are
truth
and
which
truth
are
absolut
the
answer
to
both
question
is
ye
perhap
we
have
differ
definit
of
absolut
then
to
me
an
absolut
is
someth
that
is
constant
across
time
cultur
situat
etc
true
in
everi
instanc
possibl
do
you
agre
with
thi
definit
i
think
you
do
similarli
all
truth
is
absolut
inde
a
nonabsolut
truth
is
a
contradict
in
term
when
is
someth
absolut
when
it
is
alway
true
obvious
if
a
truth
is
not
alway
true
then
we
have
a
contradict
in
term
a
simpl
exampl
in
the
new
testament
sorri
i
dont
have
a
bibl
at
work
and
cant
provid
a
refer
woman
are
instruct
to
be
silent
and
cover
their
head
in
church
now
thi
is
scriptur
by
your
definit
thi
is
truth
and
therefor
absolut
do
woman
in
your
church
speak
do
they
cover
their
head
if
all
scriptur
is
absolut
truth
it
seem
to
me
that
woman
speak
in
and
come
to
church
with
bare
head
should
be
intoler
to
evangel
yet
clearli
woman
do
speak
in
evangel
church
and
come
with
bare
head
at
least
thi
wa
the
case
in
the
evangel
church
i
grew
up
in
evangel
are
clearli
not
take
thi
particular
part
of
scriptur
to
be
absolut
truth
and
there
are
plenti
of
other
exampl
can
you
reconcil
thi
mani
peopl
claim
that
there
are
no
absolut
in
the
world
such
a
statement
is
terribl
selfcontradictori
let
me
put
it
to
you
thi
way
if
there
are
no
absolut
shouldnt
we
conclud
that
the
statement
there
are
no
absolut
is
not
absolut
true
obvious
we
have
a
contradict
here
i
dont
claim
that
there
are
no
absolut
i
think
there
are
veri
few
though
and
determin
absolut
is
difficult
thi
is
just
one
of
the
reason
whi
christian
defi
the
world
by
claim
that
there
are
inde
absolut
in
the
univers
there
is
hardli
consensu
even
in
evangel
christian
not
to
mention
the
rest
of
christian
regard
biblic
interpret
so
peopl
sometim
disagre
about
what
is
true
thi
doe
not
negat
the
fact
howev
that
there
are
still
absolut
in
the
univers
but
you
are
claim
that
all
of
scriptur
is
absolut
how
can
you
determin
absolut
deriv
from
scriptur
when
you
cant
agre
how
to
interpret
the
scriptur
it
veri
difficult
to
see
how
you
can
claim
someth
which
is
base
on
your
own
interpret
is
absolut
do
you
deni
that
your
own
background
educ
prejudic
etc
come
into
play
when
you
read
the
bibl
and
determin
how
to
interpret
a
passsag
do
you
deni
that
you
in
fact
interpret
