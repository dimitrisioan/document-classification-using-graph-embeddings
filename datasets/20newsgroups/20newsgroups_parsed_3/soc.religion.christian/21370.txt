i
have
seen
the
claim
but
i
dont
know
if
there
are
ani
authent
case
of
peopl
make
prolong
speech
in
real
languag
they
dont
know
from
my
observ
speak
in
tongu
in
practic
ha
noth
at
all
do
with
thi
i
have
a
simpl
test
i
take
sever
peopl
who
can
speak
onli
one
languag
eg
chine
russian
german
english
then
i
let
the
gift
one
start
speak
in
toungu
the
audienc
should
understand
the
gift
one
clearli
in
their
nativ
languag
howev
the
gift
one
can
onli
hear
himself
speak
in
hi
own
languag
there
seem
to
be
mani
point
to
the
speak
in
tongu
thing
which
are
problemat
it
use
a
prayer
languag
seem
especi
troubl
to
me
i
understand
that
when
you
pray
in
tongu
the
spirit
is
do
the
talk
and
when
you
pray
you
pray
to
god
and
the
spirit
is
god
so
the
spirit
is
talk
to
himself
which
is
whi
i
onli
go
by
the
pentecost
use
where
it
an
actual
languag
moreov
the
phrase
though
i
speak
with
the
tongu
of
men
and
angel
use
by
paul
in
i
cor
is
mislead
out
of
context
some
would
then
assum
that
there
is
some
angel
tongu
and
if
when
they
speak
it
is
no
known
languag
then
it
is
an
angel
tongu
hmmmin
the
old
testament
stori
about
the
tower
of
babel
we
see
how
god
punish
by
give
u
differ
languag
can
we
assum
then
that
if
angel
have
their
own
languag
at
all
that
they
have
the
same
one
amongst
other
angel
after
all
they
were
not
punish
in
ani
manner
so
whi
do
these
suppos
angel
tongu
all
sound
differ
from
one
anoth
it
disturb
to
think
that
some
peopl
find
way
to
justifi
jabber
but
ill
buy
the
idea
that
someon
could
talk
in
a
languag
never
learn
troubl
is
while
such
stori
abound
ani
and
all
attempt
at
verif
and
we
are
to
test
the
spirit
either
show
that
the
wit
had
no
real
idea
of
the
circumst
or
that
outright
fabric
wa
involv
the
brother
puka

like
a
friend
of
a

most
