re
proof
of
resurect
jame
sledd
write
final
there
is
no
proof
of
the
resurrect
of
christ
except
in
our
spirit
communion
with
hi
and
the
father
it
is
a
matter
of
faith
belief
without
logic
proof
inced
one
of
the
largest
stumbl
block
for
ration
western
man
myself
includ
i
hope
that
thi
is
taken
in
the
spirit
it
wa
intend
and
not
a
a
reject
of
the
resurrect
occur
i
beleiv
but
i
want
to
point
out
the
weak
of
logic
proof
term
are
be
use
in
a
load
way
here
logic
proof
is
an
extrem
messi
thing
to
appli
to
real
life
if
you
think
otherwis
tri
to
construct
a
proof
that
yesterday
happen
obvious
it
did
anyon
old
enough
to
be
read
thi
wa
there
for
it
and
rememb
that
it
happen
but
proof
a
proof
start
with
axiom
and
goe
somewher
you
need
axiom
to
talk
about
logic
proof
you
can
say
that
you
rememb
yesterday
and
that
you
take
a
axiom
that
anyth
you
clearli
rememb
happen
i
could
counterclaim
that
you
hallucin
the
whole
thing
to
talk
about
proof
of
histor
event
you
have
to
relax
the
term
a
bit
you
can
show
evid
not
proof
evid
of
the
resurrect
jesu
exist
proof
do
not
i
think
christian
goe
down
in
flame
if
the
resurrect
is
ever
disprov
i
also
think
that
thi
will
not
happen
a
the
evid
for
the
resurrect
is
quit
good
a
these
thing
go
it
is
not
entir
fair
to
claim
that
you
can
onli
take
the
resurrect
on
faith
there
are
reason
to
believ
it
that
appeal
to
the
mind
too
