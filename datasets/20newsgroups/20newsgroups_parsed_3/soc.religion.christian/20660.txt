re
sabbath
admiss
of
someon
sent
me
thi
faq
by
email
and
i
post
my
respons
here
im
not
enforc
the
inclus
limit
on
thi
faq
becaus
most
of
our
reader
probabl
havent
seen
it
clh
christ
warn
that
anyon
who
break
one
of
the
least
of
these
command
and
teach
other
to
do
the
same
will
be
call
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
matt
thi
faq
is
so
full
of
error
that
i
must
respond
to
it
i
hope
that
whoever
maintain
will
remov
from
it
the
partisan
theolog
brother
and
sister
be
new
to
the
faith
and
examin
the
decalogu
close
ive
notic
the
fourth
command
is
pretti
specif
about
keep
the
sabbath
day
it
state
the
th
day
saturday
is
the
sabbath
while
most
christian
religion
keep
or
atleast
go
to
church
on
sunday
what
up
thi
is
a
frequent
ask
question
everi
time
it
aris
it
caus
month
of
debat
so
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
you
directli
basic
it
becaus
the
law
wa
given
to
mose
a
part
of
a
specif
covenan
with
the
jew
most
of
u
arent
jew
so
we
arent
part
of
that
coven
there
wa
an
argument
earli
in
christian
histori
about
whether
the
mosaic
law
should
appli
to
gentil
who
becam
christian
you
can
see
the
account
of
thi
debat
in
act
the
main
question
there
wa
circumcis
but
keep
the
sabbath
would
be
part
of
it
a
well
the
apostl
conclud
that
we
need
not
becom
jew
in
order
to
becom
christian
and
therefor
that
rule
such
a
circumcis
did
not
appli
to
u
the
law
wa
known
to
man
befor
it
wa
reveal
on
mount
sinai
rom
note
that
where
no
law
is
there
is
no
transgress
not
onli
did
sin
exist
befor
sinai
eden
but
the
sabbath
wa
kept
befor
it
wa
reveal
on
sinai
ex
the
problem
with
the
first
coven
wa
not
the
law
but
the
promis
which
undergird
it
god
want
to
perform
hi
will
in
the
live
of
the
peopl
but
in
their
ignor
after
year
of
slaveri
they
promis
what
ever
he
say
to
do
we
will
do
that
is
whi
the
new
coven
is
base
on
better
promis
heb
rather
than
do
away
with
the
law
god
promis
to
put
my
law
in
their
mind
and
write
them
on
their
heart
heb
includ
the
sabbath
in
the
act
is
select
inclus
the
sabbath
wa
more
import
to
the
jew
than
circumcis
if
ani
attempt
had
been
made
to
do
away
with
the
sabbath
the
reaction
would
have
been
even
more
strident
than
is
record
in
act
do
not
confus
the
weekli
sabbath
of
the
decalogu
with
the
ceremoni
sabbath
which
could
occur
at
ani
time
of
the
week
and
were
part
of
the
law
ceremoni
which
wa
ad
becaus
of
transgress
of
the
moral
law
gal
israel
stand
for
god
peopl
of
all
time
that
is
whi
god
graft
the
gentil
in
rom
say
that
the
adopt
the
glori
the
coven
the
give
of
the
law
the
servic
of
god
and
the
promis
belong
to
israelit
in
explan
paul
make
it
clear
that
be
born
into
israel
is
not
enough
for
they
are
not
all
israel
which
are
of
israel
v
then
in
gal
he
say
if
ye
be
christ
then
are
ye
abraham
seed
and
heir
accord
to
the
promis
all
christian
are
abraham
seed
jew
israelit
not
physic
for
that
is
not
the
criterion
but
spiritu
we
are
joint
heir
with
jesu
base
on
the
promis
god
made
to
all
hi
peopl
the
israelit
while
christian
agre
that
the
ot
law
do
not
all
appli
to
u
becaus
some
of
them
are
part
of
a
specif
covenan
with
the
jew
we
also
expect
to
see
some
similar
between
the
thing
god
expect
from
the
jew
and
the
thing
he
expect
from
u
after
all
it
the
same
god
howev
there
are
sever
way
of
deal
with
thi
these
day
the
most
common
approach
is
to
separ
the
ot
command
into
moral
and
ceremoni
ceremoni
command
appli
onli
to
the
jew
they
are
part
of
the
specif
mosaic
coven
these
are
thinsg
like
the
kosher
law
and
circumcis
moral
law
appli
to
everyon
most
of
the
command
are
part
of
the
moral
law
except
for
the
command
about
the
sabbath
i
believ
most
peopl
who
take
thi
approach
would
say
that
the
specif
requir
to
worship
on
the
sabbath
is
part
of
the
ceremoni
law
but
a
gener
oblig
to
worship
regularli
is
part
of
the
gener
moral
law
thu
christian
are
free
to
choos
the
specif
time
we
worship
peopl
would
probabl
agre
but
they
are
wrong
how
can
the
sabbath
command
be
ceremoni
when
it
is
part
of
a
law
which
predat
the
ceremoni
law
you
are
not
free
to
choos
your
time
of
worship
even
if
you
were
whi
do
you
follow
a
day
of
worship
which
ha
it
origin
in
pagan
sun
worship
would
you
rather
give
up
a
day
which
god
bless
sanctifi
and
hallow
in
exchang
for
one
which
all
church
leader
agre
ha
not
biblic
foundat
see
sabbath
admiss
in
socreligionchristianbiblestudi
a
more
radic
approach
which
is
gener
connect
with
john
calvin
and
the
reform
tradit
say
that
the
law
a
a
whole
is
no
longer
bind
instead
we
are
entir
under
grace
and
our
behavior
should
be
guid
sole
by
love
portion
of
the
ot
law
are
still
use
a
guidanc
but
they
are
not
properli
speak
legal
bind
on
u
in
practic
most
peopl
who
take
thi
posit
do
not
believ
it
is
safe
to
leav
christian
without
moral
guidannc
while
we
may
no
longer
be
under
law
a
sinner
it
not
safe
for
u
to
go
into
situat
with
no
principl
to
guid
u
were
too
good
at
selfjustif
for
that
to
be
safe
thu
christian
do
have
moral
guidanc
from
thing
like
jesu
teach
paul
advic
etc
these
may
not
be
precis
a
law
but
they
serv
much
the
same
function
a
and
have
larg
the
same
content
a
the
moral
law
in
the
previou
analysi
while
calvin
would
deni
that
we
have
a
fix
legal
respons
to
worship
on
ani
specif
day
he
would
say
that
given
human
weak
the
disciplin
of
regular
worship
is
import
i
do
not
care
what
calvin
or
ani
theologian
say
my
guid
is
what
god
say
if
be
not
under
the
law
mean
we
do
not
have
to
keep
the
law
whi
is
it
that
the
onli
section
of
the
law
we
have
troubl
with
is
the
sabbath
command
which
is
the
onli
one
god
thought
wa
import
enough
to
say
rememb
if
you
studi
the
word
deepli
you
will
note
that
the
messag
is
that
we
are
no
longer
under
the
condemn
of
the
law
but
freed
by
the
grace
of
god
if
a
cop
pull
me
over
for
speed
then
in
court
i
ask
for
merci
and
the
judg
doe
not
throw
the
book
at
me
but
give
me
grace
do
i
walk
out
of
the
court
say
i
can
now
go
on
speed
for
i
am
now
under
grace
be
under
grace
i
now
drive
within
the
speed
limit
paul
add
to
it
in
rom
di
we
then
make
void
the
law
through
faith
god
forbid
yea
we
establish
the
law
wherefor
the
law
is
holi
and
the
command
holi
and
just
and
good
rom
in
both
analys
the
specif
day
is
not
an
issu
a
a
matter
of
tradit
we
worship
on
sunday
a
a
memori
of
christ
resurrect
there
some
debat
about
what
act
show
about
earli
christian
worship
the
most
common
analysi
is
that
is
show
jewish
christian
continu
to
go
to
jewish
servic
on
the
sabbath
but
that
specif
christian
servic
were
not
necessarili
held
then
act
show
worship
on
the
first
day
sunday
and
i
cor
also
impli
gather
on
that
day
there
are
a
few
group
that
continu
to
believ
christian
have
to
worship
on
the
sabbath
saturday
the
bestknown
are
the
seventhday
adventist
and
jehovah
wit
they
argu
that
act
is
not
a
regular
worship
servic
but
a
special
meet
to
see
paul
off
and
that
i
cor
doesnt
explicitli
say
it
a
regular
worship
servic
do
you
prefer
implic
to
fact
a
care
studi
of
the
act
show
that
the
meet
wa
on
saturday
night
and
that
on
sunday
morn
paul
did
not
go
to
a
worship
servic
but
set
off
on
a
long
journey
by
foot
to
asso
in
icor
there
is
no
way
you
can
equat
lay
by
him
in
store
with
go
to
a
worship
servic
it
clear
that
thi
issu
wa
a
contest
one
in
paul
time
see
rom
paul
advic
is
that
we
should
be
veri
care
about
judg
each
other
on
issu
like
thi
one
person
see
a
specif
day
a
mandat
by
god
while
anoth
doe
not
he
who
observ
that
specif
day
doe
it
in
honor
of
the
lord
he
who
believ
hi
worship
is
free
of
such
restrict
also
doe
it
in
honor
of
the
lord
those
who
believ
that
the
sabbath
is
still
mandat
argu
that
paul
is
not
refer
to
sabbath
worship
here
note
howev
col
which
say
someth
similar
but
briefer
it
explicitli
mention
sabbath
wrong
these
are
the
sabbath
day
of
the
ceremoni
law
not
the
sabbath
day
of
the
moral
law
there
are
some
differ
among
christian
about
use
of
the
word
sabbath
origin
the
term
refer
to
the
th
day
the
jewish
day
of
worship
mani
christian
now
use
it
to
refer
to
sunday
the
day
of
christian
worship
they
do
thi
larg
so
that
they
can
appli
the
th
or
whatev
there
are
a
coupl
of
differ
number
scheme
command
to
it
reform
tradit
doe
not
do
thi
it
distinguish
between
the
sabbath
which
is
the
observ
mandat
for
jew
and
the
lord
day
which
is
the
free
christian
worship
the
onli
refer
i
can
find
to
thi
in
the
nt
is
rev
there
are
also
differ
about
law
regard
thi
day
mani
christian
support
blue
law
both
in
secular
law
and
church
law
set
asid
that
day
and
caus
peopl
to
spend
it
in
worship
the
more
radic
antileg
approach
see
such
regul
a
a
return
to
the
jewish
sabbath
which
is
not
appropri
to
the
free
christian
worship
of
the
lord
day
whi
would
you
prefer
to
twist
and
turn
reli
on
differ
argument
which
conflict
with
each
other
rather
than
obey
a
simpl
request
from
a
god
who
love
you
enough
to
die
for
you
jesu
die
becaus
the
law
could
not
be
chang
whi
bother
to
die
in
order
to
meet
the
demand
of
a
broken
law
if
all
you
need
to
do
is
chang
the
law
penalti
for
law
break
mean
the
law
is
immut
that
is
whi
it
is
no
sin
not
to
follow
the
demand
of
the
ceremoni
law
it
will
alway
be
a
sin
to
make
fals
god
to
violat
god
name
to
break
the
sabbath
to
steal
to
kill
etc
except
it
you
disagre
but
then
your
opinion
ha
no
weight
when
place
next
to
the
word
of
god
dariu
it
not
clear
how
much
more
need
to
be
said
other
than
the
faq
i
think
paul
comment
on
esteem
one
day
over
anoth
rom
is
probabl
all
that
need
to
be
said
i
accept
that
dariu
is
do
what
he
doe
in
honor
of
the
lord
i
just
wish
he
might
equal
accept
that
those
who
esteem
all
day
alik
are
similarli
do
their
best
to
honor
the
lord
howev
id
like
to
be
clear
that
i
do
not
think
there
unambigu
proof
that
regular
christian
worship
wa
on
the
first
day
a
i
indic
there
are
respons
on
both
of
the
passag
cite
the
difficulti
with
both
of
these
passag
is
that
they
are
actual
about
someth
el
they
both
look
like
they
are
talk
about
nnregular
christian
meet
but
neither
explicitli
say
and
they
gather
everi
sunday
for
worship
we
get
variou
piec
of
inform
but
noth
aim
at
answer
thi
question
act
describ
christian
a
particip
both
in
jewish
templ
worship
and
in
christian
communion
servic
in
home
obvious
the
templ
worship
is
on
the
sabbath
act
is
an
exampl
of
christian
particip
in
them
unfortun
it
doesnt
tell
u
what
day
christian
met
in
their
hous
act
despit
dariu
confus
is
describ
by
act
a
occur
on
sunday
i
see
no
reason
to
impos
modern
definit
of
when
day
start
when
the
biblic
text
is
clear
about
what
wa
meant
the
word
impli
to
me
that
thi
wa
a
normal
meet
it
doesnt
say
they
gather
to
see
paul
off
but
that
when
they
were
gather
for
break
bread
paul
talk
about
hi
upcom
travel
but
that
just
not
explicit
enough
to
be
realli
convinc
similarli
with
cor
it
say
that
on
the
first
day
they
should
set
asid
money
for
paul
collect
now
if
you
want
to
believ
that
they
gather
special
to
do
thi
or
that
they
did
it
in
their
home
i
cant
disprov
it
but
the
obviou
time
for
a
congreg
to
take
an
offer
would
be
when
they
normal
gather
for
worship
and
if
they
were
expect
to
do
it
in
their
home
there
would
be
no
reason
to
mention
a
specif
day
so
i
think
the
most
obviou
read
of
thi
is
that
on
the
first
day
of
everi
week
simpli
mean
everi
time
they
gather
for
worship
i
think
the
reason
we
have
onli
implic
and
not
clear
statement
is
that
the
nt
author
assum
that
their
reader
knew
when
christian
