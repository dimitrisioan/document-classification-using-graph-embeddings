but
at
the
begin
of
your
second
paragraph

the
ceremoni
and
moral
law
in

not
onli
do
i
not
understand
where
in
the
bibl
you
find
the
declar
that
there
are

but
i
am
also
unclear
on

think
it
is
bad
to
have
set
of

in
the
first
place
if
it
bad
to
have
set
of

how
can
there
be
a
ceremoni
law
that
is
differ
from
the
moral
law
and
vice
versa
i
would
also
be
interest
in
your
comment
on
the
passag
in
i
cor
where
paul
teach
differ

depend
on
whether
you
are
a
man
or
a

do
you
think
the

prescrib
differ
set
of

if
so
then
