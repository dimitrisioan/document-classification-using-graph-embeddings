ok
what
more
import
to
gay
christian
sex
or
christian
im
afraid
i
see
that
question
a
veri
tendenti
tri
rephras
it
what
more
import
to
christian
love
of
god
or
love
of
other
human
be
to
which
of
cours
the
onli
conceiv
answer
is
that
the
one
is
like
the
other
i
am
deepli
suspici
of
ani
flavor
of
christian
which
would
elev
one
claus
of
the
great
command
to
a
prioriti
over
the
other
such
a
to
claim
a
conflict
true
we
are
told
to
let
the
dead
buri
the
dead
to
hate
famili
rather
than
let
it
keep
u
from
follow
christ
but
the
dichotomi
here
is
not
one
between
love
of
our
fellow
and
love
of
god
but
of
allow
social
construct
to
blind
u
to
the
presens
of
god
it
is
particularli
satan
to
twist
love
of
god
in
such
a
manner
a
to
becom
an
excus
to
treat
other
a
on
a
differ
level
than
the
one
who
is
so
caught
up
in
love
of
god
the
troubl
come
in
the
relat
of
human
love
and
human
sex
ye
it
ha
sometim
been
the
case
that
the
church
ha
taught
that
all
sex
wa
nasti
evil
sin
stuff
but
when
man
and
wife
leav
their
parent
home
to
becom
helpmat
live
in
one
flesh
it
is
the
sex
that
is
the
vehicl
of
becom
one
flesh
if
you
doubt
me
read
st
paul
on
what
is
wrong
with
frequent
prostitut
le
provoc
what
i
mean
is
just
thi
sexual
bond
is
a
deepli
found
aspect
of
our
social
interact
and
in
particular
is
the
foundat
of
the
institut
of
marriag
so
that
unlik
with
mani
mammal
human
male
remain
with
and
foster
the
child
they
beget
and
support
their
child
mother
thi
is
the
schema
behind
genesi
and
behind
jesu
citat
of
that
passag
i
observ
by
the
way
that
not
all
human
male
in
fact
do
a
i
have
just
describ
but
anoth
thing
that
character
human
societi
is
our
rais
of
nonbegotten
child
not
onli
orphan
and
adopte
and
the
like
but
product
of
the
quit
common
infidel
of
human
to
their
spous
we
are
in
thi
not
uniqu
in
the
anim
world
but
the
full
extent
of
social
consequ
and
implic
is
most
intric
for
u
ye
of
cours
it
sometim
goe
wrong
like
all
el
we
do
it
is
infect
with
sin
and
you
find
marri
coupl
where
there
is
no
bond
and
peopl
so
deliri
addict
to
the
initi
stage
of
sexual
bond
format
the
infatu
fall
in
love
phase
that
they
break
ani
form
bond
in
order
to
keep
step
over
the
threshold
of
the
deep
uniti
god
ha
prepar
for
u
and
step
back
out
again
right
away
satan
may
inde
use
sex
a
a
veri
handi
tool
to
corrupt
human
love
but
in
the
eden
creation
that
is
not
it
natur
and
with
god
grace
under
the
power
of
christ
to
make
all
thing
new
it
need
not
be
a
problem
for
christian
though
we
must
be
vigil
even
in
christ
a
the
devil
is
watch
prowl
around
like
a
roar
lion
seek
someon
to
devour
so
return
to
the
origin
question
what
is
more
import
to
straight
christian
sex
or
christian
paul
clearli
tend
to
think
that
sex
wa
at
best
a
distract
from
christian
though
to
be
charit
to
him
hi
context
wa
in
expect
of
immedi
parousia
so
that
the
hard
task
of
a
marri
union
the
lifelong
build
and
adapt
to
each
other
seem
somehow
to
undercut
the
proper
prepar
for
an
immedi
eschaton
sinc
we
do
not
know
the
hour
of
return
we
should
act
both
with
instant
readi
for
that
and
with
a
commiti
to
our
mate
that
propos
a
long
lifetim
togeth
and
tell
peopl
not
to
bond
in
such
a
perspect
strike
me
a
crippl
u
in
the
second
claus
of
the
the
command
to
love
i
would
claim
that
onli
a
veri
few
saint
have
the
capac
to
deepli
love
without
sexual
ting
or
complic
mind
you
their
fellow
human
be
unless
they
have
had
a
deepli
spiritu
life
in
marri
union
grow
togeth
a
one
flesh
and
that
mean
in
the
type
case
with
a
persist
and
continu
sexual
relationship
we
are
human
and
littl
good
come
of
tri
to
mortifi
the
flesh
to
the
point
of
pretend
to
be
otherwis
pretend
not
to
be
sexual
be
christian
i
would
hope
would
they
be
will
to
forgo
sex
complet
in
order
to
avoid
be
a
stumbl
block
to
other
it
depend
entir
on
context
if
that
context
is
major
hypocrisi
on
the
part
of
those
who
find
u
stumbl
block
i
am
much
le
of
a
mind
to
effac
myself
so
that
they
can
pontif
about
my
sin
there
are
some
peopl
for
whom
a
life
of
celibaci
is
a
spritual
gift
and
mayb
even
a
victori
against
a
tothem
troubl
sexual
urg
that
seem
to
them
to
lead
onli
to
sin
noth
i
say
should
ever
be
read
a
demean
such
a
gift
nor
the
even
rarer
gift
of
love
for
all
our
conspecif
and
inde
for
all
god
creation
that
can
develop
to
the
full
without
the
tutor
of
a
spousalhelpm
marriag
found
in
sex
but
there
is
a
differ
between
spiritu
gift
and
penanc
tell
peopl
that
they
have
to
have
a
particular
gift
or
el
what
is
fraught
with
manipul
and
disregard
of
the
differ
of
our

from
god
to
one

the
gift
of

to

the
