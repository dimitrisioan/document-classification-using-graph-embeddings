write
someon
call

ha
claim
that
there
is
a
way
out
of
the
loop
but
he
did
not
bother
to
explain
what
it
wa
prefer
instead
to
paraphras
sartr
rambl
about
wittgenstein
and
say
that
the
conclus
of
my
argument
lead
to
relativ
i
will
answer
thi
a
i
find
time
rexlex
suggest
that
peopl
read
he
is
there
and
he
is
not
silent
by
franci
schaeffer
i
didnt
think
veri
highli
of
it
but
i
think
that
mr
schaeffer
is
grossli
overr
by
mani
evangel
christian
somebodi
el
might
like
it
though
so
dont
let
my
opinion
stop
you
from
read
it
if
someon
is
interest
in
my
opinion
id
suggest
on

michael
l
siemon
notic
what
i
said
about
thi
book
i
call
it
easi
read
the
reason
i
drop
philosphi
a
my
major
wa
becaus
i
ran
into
too
mani
pharisa
simon
i
dont
know
how
mani
walk
encyclopedia
i
ran
across
in
philosphi
class
the
problem
isnt
in
know
sooooo
much
more
than
your
averag
lay
person
the
problem
come
when
you
becom
puf
up
about
it
schaeffer
is
just
fine
for
the
averag
lay
person
that
wa
who
he
wa
writ
to
i
suppos
that
you
would
have
criticis
john
that
hi
gospel
wa
to
simpl
ive
talk
with
schaeffer
one
on
one
ive
been
in
lectur
with
the
man
when
he
wa
be
drill
by
philosphi
student
and
prof
from
secular
a
well
a
christian
univers
nd
alon
would
fill
both
those
catagori
hi
answer
were
enough
that
the
prof
themselv
often
were
taken
back
and
caus
to
rethink
what
their
question
wa
i
saw
thi
time
and
time
again
at
differ
open
forum
so
ye
schaeffer
book
are
by
in
larg
well
simplist
it
certainli
isnt
grad
level
read
but
we
must
get
off
our
high
hors
when
it
come
to
recommend
read
do
you
serious
think
most
peopl
would
get
through
the
first
chapter
of
wittgenstein
i
may
have
more
to
say
about
thi
secular
scientist
at
anoth
time
also
one
must
final
get
beyond
the
doubt
caus
by
insist
inquisit
one
can
not
live
hi
life
constantli
from
a
cartisian
doubt
base
look
the
christian
wholeheartedli
support
genuin
ration
but
we
must
add
a
qualif
to
give
thi
balanc
christian
is
second
to
none
in
keep
reason
in
it
place
we
never
know
the
valu
of
a
thing
until
we
know
it
limit
put
unlimit
valu
on
someth
and
in
the
end
you
will
exhaust
it
of
all
valu
thi
is
whi
xianiti
is
thoroughli
ration
but
not
the
least
bit
rationalist
it
also
explain
the
curiou
fact
that
it
is
ration
and
not
christian
faith
which
lead
to
irration
if
we
forget
the
limit
of
a
thing
we
fli
in
the
face
of
realiti
and
condem
ourselv
to
learn
the
simpl
iron
lesson
of
life
more
without
limit
is
le
le
with
limit
is
more
or
a
i
have
so
often
state
it
freedom
without
form
soon
becom
form
wo
freedom
let
put
it
anoth
way
the
ration
of
faith
is
implac
oppos
to
absurd
but
ha
no
quarrel
with
mysteri
think
about
that
it
can
tell
the
differ
between
the
two
if
you
will
let
it
christian
content
with
ration
is
not
that
it
ha
too
much
reason
in
it
but
that
it
ha
veri
littl
el
when
a
christian
come
to
faith
hi
understand
and
hi
trust
go
hand
in
hand
but
a
he
continu
in
faith
hi
trust
may
sometim
be
call
to
go
on
by
itself
without
hi
understand
thi
is
where
the
principl
of
suspend
judgment
appli
at
such
time
if
the
christian
faith
is
to
be
itself
and
let
god
be
god
it
must
suspend
judgment
and
say
father
i
do
not
understand
you
but
i
trust
you
now
dont
read
all
your
object
of
me
into
that
statement
i
wasnt
say
i
do
not
understand
you
at
all
but
i
trust
you
anyway
it
mean
that
i
do
not
understand
you
in
thi
situat
but
i
do
understand
whi
i
trust
you
anyway
therefor
i
can
trust
that
you
understand
even
though
i
do
not
the
former
is
a
mysteri
unreliev
by
ration
and
indistinguish
from
absurd
the
latter
is
a
statement
of
ration
of
faith
walk
hand
in
hand
with
the
mysteri
of
faith
so
the
principl
of
suspend
judgment
is
not
irrat
it
is
not
a
leap
of
faith
but
a
walk
of
faith
a
believ
we
can
not
alway
know
whi
but
we
canalway
know
whi
we
trust
god
who
know
whi
and
thi
make
all
the
differ
now
there
is
one
obviou
snag
to
all
thi
and
thi
is
where
i
have
part
compani
with
philosophi
what
is
emin
reason
in
theori
is
a
rather
bit
more
difficult
in
practic
in
practic
the
pressur
of
mysteri
act
on
faith
like
the
insist
whi
of
a
year
old
it
isnt
just
that
we
would
like
to
know
what
we
do
not
know
but
that
we
feel
we
must
know
what
we
can
not
know
the
one
produc
frustrat
becaus
curio
is
deni
the
other
lead
to
genuin
anguish
more
specif
the
poorer
our
understand
is
in
come
to
faith
the
more
necessari
it
will
be
to
understand
everyth
after
come
to
faith
if
we
do
not
know
whi
we
trust
god
then
we
will
alway
need
to
know
exactli
what
god
is
do
in
order
to
trust
him
fail
to
grasp
that
we
may
not
be
abl
to
trust
him
for
anyth
we
do
not
understand
may
count
decisev
against
what
we
are
abl
to
trust
if
on
the
other
hand
we
do
know
whi
we
trust
god
we
will
be
abl
to
trust
him
in
situat
where
we
do
not
understand
what
he
is
do
too
mani
xian

teach
a
if
the
christian
had
a
window
in
the
back
of
hi
head
which
allow
for

fall
for
what
god
is

may
be

it
will
not

it
may

inscrut
what
would
