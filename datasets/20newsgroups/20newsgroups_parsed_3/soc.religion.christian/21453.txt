and
hi
follow
mistak
in
thi
area
are
costli
and
danger
for

my
greatest
fear
in
thi
area
would
be
the
follow
that
the
peopl
would
be
misl
that
peopl
would
lose
respect
for
christian
that
true
propheci
would
be
cloud
by
all
the
fals
propheci
were
god
to
call
me
to
be
a
prophet
and
i
were
to
misrepres
god
word
my
call
would
be
lost
forev
god
word
would
command

a
i
would
be
a
fals

my
bridg
would
be
burnt
forev
perhap
i
could
repent
and
be
save
but
i
could
never
again
be
a
prophet
of
god
in
the
light
of
thi
it
is
critic
that
we
speak
when
the
lord
say
speak
and
that
we
be
silent
when
the
lord
say
to
be
silent
lest
we
depriv
the
world
of
god
word
and
hide
it
under
a
bushel
either
by
our
inappropri
cowardli
silenc
or
by
our
fals
statement
and
becaus
of
thi
it
is
critic
import
that
we
remain
close
to
the
lord
in
hi
word
and
in
prayer
and
fill
with
the
spirit
of
god
so
that

time
that

against
