subject
re
major
view
of
the
triniti
in
articl
you
write
ye
my
comment
were
long
enough
that
i
dont
want
to
repeat
them
here
but
ill
send
them
via
email
back
to
the
author
certainli
it
wa
not
intend
to
be
a
descript
of
three
similar
deiti
though
i
certainli
see
whi
it
would
look
that
way
thank
for
the
letter
your
comment
help
some
a
to
the
last
comment
i
certainli
realiz
that
it
wa
not
intend
to
sound
that
way
i
am
still
tri
to
understand
how
a
spiritu
be
colud
truli
be
one
and
three
at
the
same
time
all
of
the
descript
of
thi
are
either
platon
or
sound
like
special
plead
sort
of
they
appear
to
be
three
seper
be
in
all
way
but
realli
they
are
one
trust
me
neither
of
these
is
accept
to
me
the
fact
is
so
far
the
onli
descript
of
the
triniti
that
make
ani
sens
to
me
are
the
modalist
one
such
a
modalist
monarchian
or
econom
trinitarian
i
can
accept
that
the
three
aspect
are
intrins
to
the
natur
of
god
so
i
perhap
lean
more
toward
the
latter
i
am
tri
here
to
see
if
anybodi
can
come
up
with
anoth
descript
that
is
both
orthodox
and
believ
formerli
tdatirvsarima
or
i
fear
orthodox
theologian
have
been
overli
in
love
with
paradox
to
the
extent
that
wellmean
peopl
think
theyv
just
flatout
confus
there
no
problem
with
thing
be
both
and
eg
if
the
are
differ
part
of
the
father
son
and
holi
spirit
arent
exactli
part
of
god
becaus
part
are
thing
distinguish
by
physic
separ
all
three
person
are
omnipres
so
they
are
obvious
arent
physic
separ
but
theyr
in
some
way
differ
aspect
mode
or
whatev
of
one
god
if
you
accept
econom
trinitarian
it
possibl
that
you
dont
have
ani
substant
differ
with
the
standard
view
is
it
possibl
that
you
just
dont
find
the
neoplaton
