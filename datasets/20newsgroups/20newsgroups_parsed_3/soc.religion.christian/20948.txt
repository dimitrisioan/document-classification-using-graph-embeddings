do
you
lose
your
breath
or
do

and

be
your
afraid
of

they
should
realiz
befor

criticis
that

the
onli
way
to

is
your
mind
so
small
that
you
have
to
fall
in
with
the

that
god
is
dead
gone
open
your
eye
just
realiz
that
he
is
the
one
the
onli
one
who
can
save
you
now
from
all
thi
sin
and
hate
or
will
you
still
jeer
at
all

the
lock
on
your
heart

but
you
are
never
quit
sure
your
soul
is
ill
but
you
will
not
find
a
cure
your
world
wa
made
for
you
by
someon
abov
but
you
choos
evil
way
instead
of
love
you
made
me
master
of
the
world
where
you
exist
the
soul
i
took
from
you
wa
not
even
miss
lord
of
the
world
evil
possessor

of
thi
world

now
your
confessor

think
your
innoc
youv
noth
to
fear
