mr

an

is
no

i
would
beg
to
differ
with
you
here
the
properlyform
conscienc
can
be
trust
virtual
all
the
time
which
just
move
the
problem
back
one
level
how
do
you
tell
if
your
conscienc
is
properli
form
the
onli
way
to
tell
is
to
presuppos
that
you
are
capabl
of
judg
the
formed
of
your
own
conscienc
in
other
word
you
can
onli
be
sure
that
your
conscienc
is
properli
form
if
you
assum
that
your
evalu
can
be
trust
assum
your
conclus
save
you
a
lot
of
time
ill
grant
but
it
not
a
valid
way
of
reason
unless
you
are
infal
your
judgement
about
your
own
think
can
not
be
certain
therefor
it
is
not
possibl
to
be
certain
your
conscienc
is
properli
form
whatev
that
is
suppos
to
mean
mr
boundari
then
give
anoth
paradigm
exampl
of
the
problem
now
you
have
hit
on
the
purpos
of
the
church
it
is
by
necess
the
infal
interpret
of
divin
revel
without
the
church
christian
would
be
noth
more
than
a
bunch
of
littl
divis
sect
the
church
is
by
necess
the
infal
interpret
of
divin
revel
how
do
you
know
presum
you
believ
thi
becaus
of
some
argument
or
anoth
how
do
you
know
that
the
argument
contain
no
mistak
you
write
therefor
although
our
mind
are
finit
and
suscept
to
error
our
compet
in
arriv
at
induct
insight
give
confid
in
our
abil
to
distinguish
what
is
true
from
what
is
not
true
even
in
area
not
subject
to
the
experiment
method
but
there
is
a
huge
differ
between
confid
in
our
abil
to
distinguish
what
is
true
from
what
is
not
true
and
infal
i
am
confid
about
a
lot
of
thing
but
absolut
certainti
is
a
veri
long
way
from
confid
thi
discus
is
about
the
arrog
of
claim
to
be
absolut
certain
realli
go
check
the
subject
line
say
you
are
absolut
certain
is
significantli
differ
than
say
you
are
confid
when
you
say
that
you
are
confid
that
invit
peopl
to
ask
whi
except
in
veri
limit
circumst
when
you
say
that
you

it
invit
peopl
to
dismiss
you
a
someon
who
doe
not
have
ani
idea
of
hi
own
fallibl
i
have
yet
to
meet
anyon
who
believ
in
a
knowablyinfal
sourc
of
truth
who
would
admit
the
possibl
of
error
in
hi
reason
all
of
them
everi
last
one
ha
claim
that
he
wa
himself
infal
the
result
ha
been
to
convinc
me
that
they
had
no
idea
what
wa
go
on
darren
f
provin
thi
particular
discus
may
not
be
entir
relev
to
the
origin
critic
i
get
the
feel
that
the
origin
poster
regard
a
arrog
the
veri
idea
that
there
are
right
and
wrong
answer
in
religion
and
that
the
differ
can
have
etern
consequ
when
i
say
that
i
think
there
is
a
hell
and
that
he
is
at
least
in
signific
danger
of
end
up
there
i
will
admit
that
a
you
say
the
reason
process
i
use
to
reach
thi
are
fallibl
thu
at
least
in
principl
i
could
be
wrong
but
these
basic
fact
are
clearli
enough
taught
in
the
bibl
that
i
think
it
unlik
that
im
misinterpret
it
in
order
to
get
thi
level
of
confid
ive
tri
to
frame
my
statement
suffici
care
a
to
sidestep
a
number
of
the
more
controversi
issu
i
havent
for
exampl
said
that
all
nonchristian
will
definit
end
up
in
hell
and
i
havent
attempt
to
describ
hell
in
ani
detail
i
have
a
feel
that
my
view
is
go
to
be
regard
a
arrog
and
intoler
even
though
i
acknowledg
that
im
fallibl
and
so
there
some
chanc
im
wrong
dont
get
me
wrong
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
genuin
arrog
christian
and
often
critic
of
u
is
justifi
but
in
at
least
some
case
i
think
the
critic
constitut
blame
the
messeng
if
the
univers
is
set
up
so
that
there
are
etern
consequ
for
certain
decis
it
not
my
fault
im
just
tell
it
the
way
i
think
it
is
you
may
think
god
is
immor
for
set
thing
up
that
way
it
one
of
the
critiqu
of
christian
that
i
find
it
most
difficult
to
respond
to
but
it
not
arrog
for
me
to
tell
what
i
think
is
the
truth
