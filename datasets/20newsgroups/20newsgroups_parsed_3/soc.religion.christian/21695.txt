homosexu
is
immor
nonreligi
argument
thi
wa
crosspost
to
a
zillion
group
i
dont
intend
to
carri
an
entir
discus
crosspost
from
altsex
particularli
one
whose
motiv
seem
to
be
have
a
fun
argument
howev
i
thought
reader
might
be
interest
to
know
about
the
discus
there
clh
i
intend
to
endeavor
to
make
the
argument
that
homosexu
is
an
immor
practic
or
lifestyl
or
whatev
you
call
it
i
intend
to
show
that
there
is
a
basi
for
a
ration
declar
of
thi
statement
i
intend
to
also
show
that
such
a
declar
can
be
made
without
there
be
a
religi
justif
for
moral
in
fact
to
show
that
such
a
standard
can
be
made
if
one
is
an
atheist
anyon
who
want
to
join
in
on
the
fun
in
take
the
other
side
ie
that
they
can
make
the
claim
that
homosexu
is
not
immor
or
that
collater
it
is
a
moral
valid
practic
is
free
to
do
so
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
peopl
who
dont
believ
one
can
have
a
ration
base
moral
without
have
a
religion
attach
to
it
thi
should
be
fun
to
tri
and
figur
thi
out
and
i
want
to
tri
and
expo
no
pun
intend
my
idea
and
see
other
peopl
and
see
where
their
idea
are
stand

im
not
sure

that
a
the
main
forum
