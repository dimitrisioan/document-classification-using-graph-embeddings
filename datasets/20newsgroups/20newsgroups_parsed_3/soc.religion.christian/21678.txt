which
i
have
begun
read
but
sinc
my
earlier
note
were
post
to
thi
forum
i
will
conclud
here
a
well
a
week
ago
i
manag
to
find
time
to
consult
a
septuagint
concord
and
a
lxx
text
with
apparatu
at
the
librari
and
i
can
now
use
conclud
my
look
at
the
greek
word
for
love
a
use
in
the
christian
background
of
the
septuagint
translat
of
the
jewish
scriptur
the
princip
result
is
that
there
is
a
cluster
of
use
of
the
verbal
noun
from
erao
erast
mean
lover
thi
cluster
occur
just
where
one
might
most
expect
it
in
the
propeth
imag
and
accus
of
israel
a
faithless
spous
to
yhwh
the
vers
in
question
are
hosea
jeremiah
lament
and
ezekiel
and
hosea
seem
to
have
origin
thi
usag
which
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
pick
up
lament
is
depend
on
though
not
like
written
by
jeremiah
the
erot
mean
in
it
allegor
use
not
at
all
liter
is
evid
so
too
in
english
unless
you
complement
it
with
a
phrase
like
of
the
art
the
word
lover
is
go
to
have
an
overton
of
sexual
relationship
there
is
no
surpris
here
but
it
is
worthwhil
to
see
that
standard
greek
usag
doe
show
up
in
the
translat
from
the
hebrew
more
interestingli
and
some
confirm
of
my
guess
that
later
koin
usag
avoid
the
verb
erao
becaus
of
it
homonymi
to
ero
say
eromai
ask
there
is
an
error
in
codex
vaticanu
normal
a
veri
valuabl
wit
where
a
form
of
erao
is
use
in
a
complet
absurd
context
samuel
where
the
mean
must
be
say
in
addit
to
the
abov
and
the
use
i
have
alreadi
mention
in
proverb
esther
use
the
verb
in
it
most
natur
applic
kai
erasth
ho

esther

the

love
esther
and
rather
more
