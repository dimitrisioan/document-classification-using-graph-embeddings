life
in
articl
wr
ite
while
thi
is
essenti
a
discuss
of
reincarn
in
the
context
of
christian
gerri
palo
ha
made
some
comparison
to
asian
religi
belief
on
thi
topic
which
have
simplifi
the
asian
idea
of
karma
to
the
point
of
misrepresent
i
realiz
that
my
gener
would
probabl
have
problem
under
scrutini
from
variou
asian
point
of
view
they
need
to
be
discuss
in
detail
inde
but
for
the
purpos
of
thi
newsgroup
and
thread
thu
far
and
in
thi
newsgroup
i
risk
oversimpli
ficat
my
main
purpos
wa
to
emphas
that
i
wa
not
come
from
a
buddhist
or
hindu
point
of
view
a
you
observ
the
main
context
is
that
of
christian
but
by
all
mean
add
comment
and
correct
a
you
find
them
i
wrote
a
longer
repli
address
some
of
your
point
but
decid
to
not
post
it
perhap
it
would
be
more
appropri
for
socreligion
eastern
instead
i
just
add
the
follow
coupl
of
item
about
karma
and
reincarn
a
i
see
the
matter
from
an
anthroposoph
and
a
christian
point
of
view
karma
is
not
simpl
reward
and
punish
dealt
out
by
a
judg
deiti
reincarn
is
not
the
same
a
be
born
again
reincarn
is
not
the
same
a
the
resurrect
of
the
bodi
reincarn
and
karma
do
not
contradict
the
fundament
teach
of
christian
about
god
the
fall
the
be
incarn
death
and
resurrect
of
christ
hi
come
again
sin
grace
forgiv
salvat
and
the
last
judgement
isnt
origen
usual
cite
a
the
most
prestigi
propon
of
reincarn
among
christian
thinker
what
were
hi
view
and
how
did
he
relat
them
to
the
christian
scriptur
jack
carrol
origen
work
wa
mostli
lost
he
wa
not
anathemat
to
my
knowledg
but
hi
write
come
down
larg
in
fragment
and
quotat
from
enemi
perhap
someon
els
can
comment
on
origen
i
dont
know
if
there
is
a
specif
statement
about
reincarn
from
him
but
from
what
i
do
know
about
him
he
probabl
did
hold
to
the
teach
in
one
form
or
anoth
i
dont
know
too
much
about
the
histori
of
the
idea
of
reincarn
in
the
church
howev
i
heard
an
interest
stori
about

would
ask
the
pope
what
he
thought
about
