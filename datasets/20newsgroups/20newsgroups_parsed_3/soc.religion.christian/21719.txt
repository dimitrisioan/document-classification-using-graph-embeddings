commit
my
life
to
god
hi
everyon
im
tri
to
find
my
way
to
god
but
find
it
difficult
a
i
cant
hear
god
talk
to
me
let
me
know
that
he
exist
and
is
with
me
and
that
he
know
me
and
i
feel
that
i
cant
possibl
get
to
know
him
until
he
doe
mayb
he
is
talk
to
me
but
i
just
dont
know
or
understand
how
to
listen
some
christian
tell
me
that
in
their
opinion
the
onli
way
to
find
god
is
to
take
a
plung
and
commit
your
life
to
him
and
you
will
discov
thi
idea
of
dive
into
the
total
unknown
is
a
littl
bit
frighten
but
i
have
a
few
question
how
do
you
actual
commit
yourself
if
i
just
say
ok
god
her
you
go
im
commit
my
life
to
you
i
wouldnt
realli
feel
that
hed
listen
at
least
i
couldnt
be
sure
that
he
had
so
how
doe
one
or
how
did
you
commit
oneself
to
god
in
commit
myself
in
thi
way
what
do
i
have
to
forfeit
of
my
current
life
what
can
i
no
longer
do
i
feel
that
im
a
good
a
mani
christian
and
i
tri
to
uphold
the
idea
of
love
your
neighbour
i
dont
go
round
kill
peopl
steal
etc
and
i
tri
not

way
and
i
would
