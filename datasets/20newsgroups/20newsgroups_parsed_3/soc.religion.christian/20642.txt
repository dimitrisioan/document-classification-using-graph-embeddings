we
affirm
the
absolut
of
scriptur
not
becaus
we
are
arrog
moralist
but
becaus
we
believ
in
god
who
is
truth
who
ha
reveal
hi
truth
in
hi
word
and
therefor
we
hold
a
preciou
the
strateg
import
of
those
absolut
there
ha
been
a
lot
of
discuss
but
so
far
nobodi
seem
to
have
hit
on
exactli
what
the
critic
of
arrog
is
aim
at
lot
of
stuff
delet
thi
is
where
the
arrog
of
christian
aris
mani
peopl
believ
that
their
own
person
research
can
give
them
absolut
certainti
about
the
doctrin
of
christian
they
are
implicitli
claim
that
they
are
infal
and
that
there
is
no
possibl
of
mistak
claim
that
you
can
not
have
made
a
mistak
and
that
your
think
ha
led
you
to
a
flawless
conclus
is
pretti
arrog
i
agre
with
what
darren
ha
to
say
here
but
would
like
to
add
a
person
observ
what
i
see
a
arrog
and
the
problem
i
have
with
it
is
not
a
sens
of
person
certainti
but
a
lack
of
respect
for
other
who
come
to
differ
conclus
clearli
thi
is
not
just
christian
v
nonchristian
there
is
a
whole
spectrum
of
belief
system
within
christian
i
do
not
tend
to
argu
with
other
about
matter
of
person
faith
becaus
like
aesthet
it
is
not
demonst
by
object
mean
choos
what
to
believ
and
reli
on
are
import
area
of
person
sovereignti
what
bother
me
is
when
other
suggest
that
in
these
matter
of
faith
their
specif
belief
are
not
onli
true
to
them
but
are
absolut
and
should
be
bind
on
other
it
follow
from
thi
that
god
must
give
everyon
the
same
revel
of
truth
and
thu
anyon
who
come
to
a
differ
conclus
is
intent
choos
the
wrong
path
thi
is
the
arrog
i
see
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
honest
conclus
of
other
on
matter
which
are
between
them
and
god
even
a
person
certainti
leaf
room
for
the
belief
of
other
it
is
univers
those
matter
of
person
faith
coupl
by
a
proud
notion
that
one
relationship
with
god
is
superior
to
other
that
lead
to
arrog
in
my
honest
and
nonunivers
opinion
darren
f
provin
at
the
core
of
all
wellfound

welcom
ken
it
is
certainli
reason
to
ask
for
some
humil
about
our
own
abil
to
know
the
truth
there
are
also
differ
path
in
some
area
of
practic
but
id
like
to
see
more
clarif
about
what
you
mean
when
you
reject
the
idea
of
say
their
specif
belief
are
not
onli
true
to
them
but
are
absolut
and
should
be
bind
on
other
if
someth
is
true
it
is
true
for
everyon
assum
that
the
belief
is
someth
about
god
histori
etc
of
cours
someth
of
the
form
i
believ
that
it
best
for
me
not
to
xxx
could
be
true
for
some
peopl
and
not
other
i
have
suggest
in
the
past
that
god
may
be
le
concern
about
doctrin
agreement
than
mani
peopl
are
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
differ
between
true
and
fals
nor
that
i
think
there
is
no
benefit
in
find
out
what
is
true
