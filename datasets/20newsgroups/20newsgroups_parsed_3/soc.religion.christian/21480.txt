write
that
last
paragraph
just
about
kill
me
the
deuterocanon
have
alway
been
accept
a
inspir
scriptur
by
the
cathol
church
which
ha
exist
much
longer
than
ani
protest
church
out
there
it
wa
martin
luther
who
began
hack
up
the
bibl
and
decid
to
remov
certain
booksnot
the
fact
that
the
cathol
church
decid
to
add
some
much
laterthat
is
the
reason
for
the
differ
between
cathol
and
protest
bibl
thi
is
mislead
at
best
the
question
realli
ha
to
do
with
the
statu
of
the
greek
septuagint
versu
hebrew
scriptur
and
the
issu
predat
the
reform
by
quit
a
bit
jerom
wa
neg
about
the
deuteroncanon
and
in
fact
even
though
he
transalt
them
he
put
them
after
the
hebrew
canon
reorder
from
the
greek
order
to
the
hebrew
one
hi
translat
of
them
were
quickanddirti
also
he
report
have
done
one
of
them
in
one
day
and
anoth
overnight
just
dictat
hi
translat
to
an
amanuensi
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
vulgat
and
all
of
it
massiv
import
in
western
christian
along
with
the
vener
of
jerom
which
took
the
first
step
in
reduc
these
book
from
the
statu
they
had
and
have
among
the
greek
furthermor
it
is
inaccur
to
say
that
the
reform
threw
out
these
book
basic
they
just
place
them
in
a
secondari
statu
a
jerom
had
alreadi
done
but
with
the
addit
warn
that
doctrin
should
not
be
base
on
citat
from
these
alon
i
think
that
the
emphasi
on
the
hebrew
origin
is
sound
though
it
seem
somewhat
arbitrari
to
disallow
on
the
face
of
it
a
translat
a
part
of
a
collect
whose
principl
of
select
in
hebrew
or
greek
are
confus
or
unknown
and
like
fraught
with
accid
it
also
seem
to
play
into
a
tendenti
notion
of
the
origin
languag
be
somehow
more
inspir
a
if
magic
and
convey
a
messag
untranslat
than
a
translat
a
if
we
could
not
hear
god
word
to
the
jew
in
greek
or
german
or
english
thi
tendenc
seem
to
have
got
a
big
boost
in
sola
scriptura
protestant
even
to
the
point
of
current
inerr
bizarr
despit
the
more
basic
underli
tendenc
of
the
reform
to
see
that
the
text
should
and
could
be
translat
if
we
can
profit
from
an
english
render
of
hebrew
and
greek
there
is
sure
littl
reason
to
keep
sirach
at
least
out
of
our
bibl
and
of
cours
anglican
dont
do
so
for
text
origin
in
greek
it
would
seem
more
to
be
antigreek
prejudic
notabl
by
the
time
the
hebrew
canon
is
fulli
attest
includ
antichristian
prejudic
which
led
to
the
jewish
abandon
of
the
septuagint
which
is
oper
btw
reader
may
enjoy
some
lectur
of
bruce
metzger
on
the
issu
of
translat
of
the
bibl
includ
some
of
what
i
said
about
jerom
abov
in
the
current
number
of
the
