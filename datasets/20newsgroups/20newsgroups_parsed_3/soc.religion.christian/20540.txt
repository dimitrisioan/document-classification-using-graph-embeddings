write
hello
fellownett
and
fellow
christian
about
the
subject
of
uniti
between
christian
and
christian
church
to
a
bibl
studi
group
alltough
i
do
have
a
person
opinion
on
thi
issu
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
opinion
of
fellow
christian
brother
and
sister
from
differ
countri
and
in
differ
situat
my
background
member
of
a
orthodox
reform
church
let
u
say
a
littl
the
onli
uniti
ive
found
which
is
true
is
when
all
parti
involv
are
discipl
i
came
out
of
a
church
in
which
even
the
differ
congreg
were
alway
compet
and
argu
about
which
one
wa
better
and
who
had
the
better
messag
while
none
of
them
put
anyth
into
practic
from
those
messag
sinc
becom
a
discipl
ive
found
that
when
i
travel
to
anoth
church
in
the
same
movement
they
are
just
a
accept
there
a
ani
other
we
had
a
retreat
back
in
januari
when
some
of
the
congreg
from
louisvil
ky
came
up
thi
retreat
wa
for
colleg
student
and
it
wa
a
though
i
had
known
even
the
peopl
from
louisvil
for
year
and
i
had
onli
becom
a
discipl
the
previou
april
and
had
never
been
to
the
church
in
kentucki
one
of
the
key
to
uniti
is
unselfish
love
and
selfsacrific
that
is
onli
one
area
in
which
discipl
stand
out
from
christian
also
anoth
part
of
uniti
is
a
common
depth
of
convict
ive
also
been
a
part
of
some
christian
campu
fellowship
who
were
focus
on
uniti
between
church
and
saw
that
those
church
had
one
thing
involv
a
lack
of
convict
about
everyth
they
believ
that
wa
whi
they
could
be
unifi
they
didnt
care
about
the
truth
but
delight
in
get
along
togeth
the
problem
here
in
the
netherland
is
that
there
are
two
other
church
denomin
with
the
same
characterist
both
have
the
same
confess
there
are
onli
some
differ
with
respect
to
for
exampl
the
matter
of
appropri
of
salvat
and
how
to
use
our
creed
in
essenc
a
lot
of
peopl
of
these
three
church
have
to
same
faith
and
feel
that
they
should
becom
one
church
but
how
that
is
the
question
creed
what
need
is
there
of
creed
when
the
bibl
stand
firmli
better
so
here
is
a
first
question
can
the
congreg
of
christ
be
separ
by
wall
of
differ
denomin
or
is
thi
definit
an
untoler
situat
accord
to
the
scriptur
accord
to
the
scriptur
split
and
differ
of
opinion
are
go
to
be
there
a
per
a
previou
note
i
mention
that
there
are
those
who
teach
fals
by
mani
mean
there
are
also
differ
of
opinion
and
belief
howev
scriptur
state
in
the
follow
direct
i
have
no
prais
for
you
for
your
meet
do
more
harm
than
good
in
the
first
place
i
hear
that
when
you
come
togeth
a
a
church
there
re
divis
among
you
and
to
some
extent
i
believ
it
no
doubt
there
have
to
be
differ
among
you
to
show
which
of
you
have
god
approv
corinthian
how
will
god
show
hi
approv
by
fruit
see
act
but
befor
that
there
are
these
qualiti
devot
to
the
apostl
teach
fellowship
communion
fill
with
awe
for
god
all
have
everyth
in
common
glad
and
sincer
heart
prais
god
enjoy
the
favor
of
the
peopl
all
these
are
mention
in
act
god
also
show
that
those
who
have
these
qualiti
are
persecut
look
at
stephen
a
man
full
of
faith
and
of
the
holi
spirit
act
who
wa
later
stone
act
can
one
say
that
onli
one
of
these
three
church
is
the
true
church
of
jesu
christ
one
can
say
that
a
church
is
the
true
church
onli
if
that
church
is
perfect
not
onli
in
the
congreg
but
worldwid
a
a
movement
i
have
yet
to
find
that
but
the
closest
one
ive
found
is
the
boston
church
of
christ
movement
which
constantli
strive
to
have
error
point
out
and
correct
it
is
also
the
onli
one
ive
seen
which
is
total
sold
out
to
god
a
problem
close
relat
to
these
question
is
can
we
cooper
with
other
christian
from
these
two
church
befor
there
is
a
uniti
thi
question
is
especi
import
for
those
who
think
that
onli
one
church
can
be
the
true
one
a
for
cooper
that
can
alway
occur
uniti
on
the
other
hand
may
never
occur
a
for
those
who
think
about
onli
one
church
be
the
true
one
i
remind
them
that
mark
state
that
there
are
discipl
who
are
not
a
part
of
the
main
group
to
begin
with
but
they
will
not
lose
their
reward
a
with
the
boston
movement
ive
heard
numer
time
thi
exact
same
thing
that
there
are
discipl
out
there
that
are
not
a
part
of
the
boston
movement
but
that
doe
not
make
them
ani
le
discipl
of
cours
few
peopl
admit
that
theyv
ever
run
into
someon
who
ha
the
qualiti
of
a
discipl
outsid
the
movement
i
know
i
havent
mayb
thi
last
problem
sound
a
littl
strang
to
most
of
you
for
your
inform
we
have
a
lot
of
organ
here
which
are
found
by
peopl
of
one
specif
church
and
whose
member
are
all
member
of
that
church
thi
ha
been
consid
a
correct
for
year
onli
a
few
year
ago
peopl
start
to
discu
about
thi
and
now
we
are
in
the
middl
of
thi
process
some
organ
are
open
their
door
for
peopl
from
other
church
etc
i
must
warn
that
thi
sound
cliquey
to
me
a
cliqu
is
a
group
which
run
around
togeth
to
some
extent
exclus
thi
caus
problem
in
fellowship
and
caus
divis
i
would
not
say
at
all
that
thi
is
someth
correct
for
a
churchgroup
to
do
for
ani
reason
in
one
of
the
church
i
attend
for
exampl
there
wa
an
intern
cliqu
of
peopl
who
were
on
the
differ
groupscommitteesorganiz
head
of
the
congreg
they
rare
talk
to
anyon
els
outsid
of
the
committe
and
seldom
were
vote
out
of
offic
without
anoth
offic
be
open
up
so
that
they
would
have
to
step
right
back
in
their
degre
of
exclus
wa
such
that
when
the
new
pastor
came
he
nearli
had
to
wipe
out
everyth
and
start
from
scratch
i
wish
he
wouldv
sinc
they
still
have
no
clue
about
what
it
mean
to
be
a
discipl
anyway
thi
rigid
in
the
cliqu
is
begin
to
be
broken
down
but
is
still
there
so
i
must
warn
against
such
divis
within
there
enough
divis
without
thank
for
your
opinion

advanc
