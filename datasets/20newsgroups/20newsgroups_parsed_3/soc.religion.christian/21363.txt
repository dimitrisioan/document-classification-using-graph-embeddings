one
thing
i
dont
understand
is
whi
be
sacr
should
make
the

ritual
secret
the

is
a
bit
mislead
while
there
is
a
profound
rever
for
the

endow
there
is
no
injunct
against
discus
the
ceremoni

sinc
public

is
often
irrever
most
mormon
would
rather
keep
silent
than
have
a
cherish
practic
malign
but
there
are
certain
element
of
the
ceremoni
which
particip
explicitli
coven
not
to
reveal
except
in
conjunct
with
the
ceremoni
itself
grant
the
gnostic
christian
had
their
secret
ritual
but
these
seem
to
have
been
taken
entir
from
pagan
prechristian
mysteri
religion
there
are
other
interpret
to
christian
histori
in
thi
matter
one
must
recal
that
most
of
what
we
know
about
the
gnostic
wa
written
by
their
enemi
eusebiu
claim
that
jesu
impart
secret
inform
to
peter
jame
and
john
after

that
those
apostl
transmit
that
inform

simon

open
a
dialog
with
peter
on
the
natur
of
god
peter
respons
is
you
seem
to
me
not
to
know
what
a
father
and
a
god
is
but
i
could
tell
you
both
whenc
soul
are
and
when
and
how
they
were
made
but
it
is
not
permit
to
me
now
to
disclos
these
thing
to
you
clementin
recognit
ii
if
ani
one
theme
underli
the
recognit
it
is
the
idea
that
certain
doctrin
are
not
to
be
idli
taught
but
can
be
had
after
a
certain
level
of
spiritu
matur
is
reach
now
one
can
approach
thi
and
other
such
evid
in
mani
way
i
dont
intend
that
everyon
interpret
christian
histori
a
i
do
but
i
believ
that
evid
exist
favor
interpret
of
cours
of
earli
christian
rite
analog
to
those
practic
by
mormon
today
neither
new
testament
christian
nor
biblic
judaism
made
a
secret
of
their
practic
but
if
judaism
and
christian
had
such
ceremoni
would
you
expect
to
read
about
them
in
public
document
one
can
search
the
book
of
mormon
and
other
mormon
scriptur
and
find
almost
no
inform
on
templ
worship
ye
you
could
establish
that
mormon
worship
in
templ
but
you
would
probabl
be
hard
press
to
character
that
worship
on
that
basi
can
we
conclud
that
the
bibl
explain
all
practic
which
might
have
taken
place
and
that
absenc
of
such
descript
prove
they
did
not
exist
mormon
scholar
dr
hugh
nibley
offer
u
a
list
of
scriptur
from
which
i
have
taken
a
few
it
is
given
unto
you
to
know
the
mysteri
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
to
them
it
is
not
given
matt
all
men
can
not
receiv
thi
say
save
they
to
whom
it
is
given
matt
i
have
yet
mani
thing
to
say
unto
you
but
ye
can
not
bear
them
now
john
the
time
cometh
when
i
shall
no
more
speak
unto
you
in
proverb
but
i
shall
shew
you
plainli
of
the
father
john
unspeak
word
which
it
is
not
law
for
a
man
to
utter
cor
mani
thing
i
would
not
write
with
paper
and
ink
but
i
come
unto
you
and
speak
face
to
face
jn
nibley
sinc
cumorah
pp
again
these
can
also
be
interpret
mani
differ
way
i
believ
they
serv
to
show
that
not
all
doctrin
which
could
have
been
taught
were
actual
taught
openli
i
have
heard
that
joseph
smith
took
the
entir
practic
ie
both
the
ritual
and
the
secreci
surround
the
ritual
from
the
freemason
anybodi
in
the
know
have
ani
authorit
inform
on
whether
or
not
thi
claim
is
true
histor
joseph
smith
had
been
adiminist
the
templ
endow
ceremoni
for
nearli
a
year
befor
join
the
freemason
there
is
diari
evid
which
support
a
claim
that
the
rite
did
not
chang
after
smith
becam
a
mason
it
can
be
argu
that
smith
had
ampl
exposur
to
mason
proceed
through
the
burlesqu
of
hi
time
and
through
hi
brother
hyrum
a
mason
though
no
specif
connect
ha
yet
been
establish
my
convers
with
mason
with
respect
to
templ
rite
transcript
which
have
appear
on
the
net
have
led
me
to
believ
that
the
connect
from
masonri
to
mormon
is
fairli
tenuou
a
our
moder
note
most
of
what
wa
similar
wa
remov
in
the
recent
revis
to
the

ceremoni
i
believ
that
critic
who
charg
that
mormon
rite
were

from

do
not
have
adequ

of
the
rite
