some
stuff
delet
fortun
for
the
conveni
of
u
believ
there
is
a
class
of
question
that
can
never
be
reduc
away
by
natur
scienc
for
exampl
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
at
all
must
there
be
a
whi
to
thi
i
ask
becaus
of
what
you
also
assum
about
god
name
that
he
just
exist
with
no
whi
to
hi
exist
so
the
question
is
revers
whi
cant
we
assum
the
univers
just
exist
a
you
assum
god
to
just
exist
whi
must
there
be
a
whi
to
the
univers
remaind
of
messag
delet
pardon
me
for
repli
to
onli
a
portion
of
your
messag
the
reason
we
can
say
god
just
exist
and
cant
say
the
univers
just
exist
is
becaus
the
univers
is
a
natur
realm
and
is
subject
to
natur
law
in
gener
and
the
law
of
caus
and
effect
in
particular
that
is
we
observ
in
natur
that
everi
caus
ha
an
effect
and
everi
effect
wa
produc
by
a
caus
the
exist
of
the
natur
realm
a
an
effect
itself
can
not
be
it
own
caus
it
must
therefor
have
a
supernatur
caus
god
on
the
other
hand
is
a
supernatur
be
and
is
therefor
not
subject
to
such
natur
law
a
the
law
of
caus
and
effect
a
a
supernatur
be
god
etern
exist
doe
not
impli
a
previou
caus
the
way
the
exist
of
a
physic
natur
cosmo
doe
thu
those
who
believ
in
the
supernatur
have
a
valid
basi
for
accept
the
exist
of
uncaus
phenomenon
such
a
the
etern
god
wherea
those
who
deni
the
exist
of
the
supernatur
are
face
with
the
dilemma
of
a
physic
univers
whose
veri
natur
show
that
it
is
not
suffici
to
explain
it
own
exist
thi
is
of
cours
an
oversimplif
of
a
complex
topic
but
i
just
want
to
clarifi
some
import
differ
between
the
supernatur
god
and
the
natur
the
univers
sinc
you
seem
to
mistak
them
a
be
interchang
mark
