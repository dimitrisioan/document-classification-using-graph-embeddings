i
think
you
are
vastli
oversimplifi
thing
we
know
that
earli
christian
suffer
totur
becaus
of
their
wit
to
christ
for
exampl
act
it
appear
that
the
jewish
ruler
of
that
time
had
a
particular
avers
to
even
hear
jesu
name
final
the
first
apostl
death
jame
of
zebede
wa
certainli
not
by
rome
hand
ani
more
than
the
first
martyr
stephen
the
problem
wa
that
if
one
believ
in
the
resurrect
then
one
must
believ
in
jesu
a
truli
be
the
son
of
god
and
what
he
stood
for
and
preach
dure
hi
ministri
on
earth
that
would
have
been
extrem
difficult
for
some
peopl
especi
those
that
had
plot
to
kill
him
the
basic
problem
with
your
argument
is
your
total
and
complet
relianc
on
the
biblic
text
luke

is
highli
suspect
i
would
refer
you
to
the
hermeneia
commentari
on
act
moreov
luke

is
written
at
least
year
after
the
fact
in

and
attempt
to
find

a

what
we
need
therefor
is
a

appreci
which
document
the
death
of

i
would
suggest
