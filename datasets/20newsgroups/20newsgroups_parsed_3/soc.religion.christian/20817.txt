what
bother
me
is
when
other
suggest
that
in
these
matter
of
faith
their
specif
belief
are
not
onli
true
to
them
but
are
absolut
and
should
be
bind
on
other
it
follow
from
thi
that
god
must
give
everyon
the
same
revel
of
truth
and
thu
anyon
who
come
to
a
differ
conclus
is
intent
choos
the
wrong
path
thi
is
the
arrog
i
see
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
honest
conclus
of
other
on
matter
which
are
between
them
and
god
it
is
certainli
reason
to
ask
for
some
humil
about
our
own
abil
to
know
the
truth
there
are
also
differ
path
in
some
area
of
practic
but
id
like
to
see
more
clarif
about
what
you
mean
when
you
reject
the
idea
of
say
their
specif
belief
are
not
onli
true
to
them
but
are
absolut
and
should
be
bind
on
other
if
someth
is
true
it
is
true
for
everyon
assum
that
the
belief
is
someth
about
god
histori
etc
ye
i
agre
what
im
tri
to
point
out
is
that
in
matter
of
faith
ie
tenet
which
are
not
logic
persuas
one
may
be
convinc
of
the
truth
of
certain
thing
through
for
instanc
person
revel
and
it
certainli
fine
to
share
that
revel
or
those
belief
with
other
and
i
dont
think
that
it
arrog
persay
to
accept
matter
of
pure
faith
a
truth
for
oneself
where
i
think
the
conflict
aris
is
in
assum
that
where
disagr
on
belief
aris
all
other
must
have
been
given
the
same
truth
and
that
god
must
reveal
hi
truth
to
everyon
in
such
a
way
that
all
would
honestli
agre
i
think
thi
can
lead
to
the
conclus
that
anyon
who
disagre
with
you
are
be
sin
or
dishonest
that
they
are
reject
someth
they
know
to
be
truth
becaus
it
is
inconveni
for
them
or
becaus
they
wish
to
spurn
god
i
would
say
that
thi
is
equival
to
assum
that
all
truth
one
hold
are
univers
and
absolut
and
the
problem
i
see
with
thi
is
that
it
negat
the
individu
of
human
and
their
relationship
with
god
thi
doe
not
mean
there
is
no
absolut
truth
just
that
some
area
of
doctrin
disagr
may
be
area
where
god
ha
not
establish
or
reveal
that
truth
