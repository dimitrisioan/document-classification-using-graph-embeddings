re
homosexu
issu
in
christian
ani
attempt
to
make
homosexu
feel
unwelcom
becaus
of
our
discomfort
with
homosexu
is
incompat
with
christian
is
our
hatr
so
deep
that
rather
than
see
someon
tri
to
becom
closer
to
jesu
we
need
to
keep
them
away
thi
is
too
often
true
mani
peopl
tri
to
place
thi
a
a
higher
sin
howev
doe
jesu
need
u
to
screen
out
those
guilti
of
a
particular
sin
do
we
realli
mistrust
jesu
when
he
say
he
can
forgiv
ani
sin
a
big
part
of
the
problem
is
that
mani
of
the
homosexu
and
peopl
advoc
accept
of
homosexu
in
church
do
not
consid
activ
homosexu
a
sin
i
dont
often
see
the
attitud
of
forgiv
me
and
i
will
tri
to
chang
instead
i
see
there
noth
wrong
with
my
life
and
i
can
be
a
good
christian
so
it
must
be
you
who
have
an
ill
becaus
you
dont
accept
me
christian
can
and
will
accept
homosexu
just
a
they
will
accept
ani
sinner
sure
it
may
be
natur
to
some
peopl
to
be
homosexu
but
it
is
also
perfectli
natur
for
everyon
to
sin
i
wa
born
with
a
desir
to
sin
but
i
work
to
prevent
myself
from
sin
it
much
le
common
now
but
i
still
have
urg
to
lash
out
in
anger
there
also
may
not
be
a
sudden
disappear
of
sin
desir
or
ever
so
it
is
sad
to
see
peopl
leav
the
church
when
they
are
discourag
that
they
are
still
homosexu
