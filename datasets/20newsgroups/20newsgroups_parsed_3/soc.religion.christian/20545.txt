if
i
talk
with
an
atheist
and
tell
him
the
new
testament
is
an
histor
reliabl
document
what
reason
would
i
give
him
i
have
found
that
thi
isnt
a
veri
effect
argument
most
atheist
are
perfectli
will
to
acknowledg
the
exist
and
ministri
of
jesusbut
are
quit
capabl
of
ration
the
miracl
and
the
resurrect
into
misunderstand
hoax
or
simpl
fabric
they
can
alway
make
an
analog
with
the
iliad
a
book
that
tell
the
stori
of
the
histor
trojan
war
but
also
talk
about
god
and
goddess
and
their
convers
i
dont
think
it
possibl
to
convinc
atheist
of
the
valid
of
christian
through
argument
we
have
to
help
foster
faith
and
an
understand
of
god
