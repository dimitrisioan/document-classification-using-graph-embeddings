re
the
arrog
of
christian
whi
do
we
follow
god
so
blindli
have
you
ever
ask
a
physic
blind
person
whi
he
or
she
follow
a
see
eye
dog
the
answer
is
quit
simpleth
dog
can
see
and
the
blind
person
can
not
of
cours
you
may
ask
if
i
can
not
trust
my
own
sen
how
do
i
know
whether
what
i
see
and
hear
about
god
is
truth
or
a
lie
that
is
whi
we
need
faith
to
be
save
we
must
forc
ourselv
to
believ
that
god
know
the
truth
and
love
u
enough
to
share
it
with
u
even
when
it
defi
what
we
think
we
know
whi
would
he
have
creat
u
if
he
did
not
love
u
enough
to
help
u
through
thi
world
seem
to
me
if
you
learn
to
differenti
between
illus
and
realiti
on
your
own
you
wouldnt
need
to
reli
on
doctrin
that
need
to
be
updat
my
experi
of
christian
year
is
that
most
christian
seek
answer
from
clergyman
who
have
littl
or
no
direct
experi
of
spiritu
matter
and
that
most
of
these
question
can
be
answer
by
simpl
introspect
most
peopl
suspect
that
they
can
not
trust
their
sen
but
few
take
the
next
step
to
figur
out
that
they
can
trust
themselv
not
to
get
too
esoter
but
it
seem
that
most
religion
christian
includ
are
found
by
particularli
intuit
peopl
who
understand
thi
stuff
delet
a
for
you
no
one
can
convert
you
you
must
choos
to
follow
god
of
your
own
will
if
you
are
ever
to
follow
him
all
we
a
christian
wish
to
do
is
share
with
you
the
love
we
have
receiv
from
god
if
you
reject
that
we
have
to
accept
your
decis
although
we
alway
keep
the
offer
open
to
you
if
you
realli
want
to
find
out
whi
we
believ
what
we
believ
i
can
onli
suggest
you
tri
pray
for
faith
read
the
bibl
and
ask
christian
about
their
experi
person
and
what
if
the
origin
poster
pixi
is
never
convert
doe
it
make
sen
that
she
or
i
or
the
major
of
human
for
that
matter
would
go
to
hell
for
etern
a
mani
christian
believ
it
make
more
sen
to
me
that
rather
than
be
convert
to
a
centuriesold
doctrin
that
hold
no
life
for
her
that
she
simpli
continu
to
decid
for
herself
what
is
best
you
may
be
right
about
christian
reli
on
clergi
but
i
have
some
reason
to
hope
your
not
protest
emphas
convers
experi
of
the
holi
spirit
and
use
of
the
bibl
thi
is
intend
to
make
sure
that
christian
have
religi
experi
of
their
own
and
that
they
have
some
basi
on
which
to
judg
claim
of
clergi
and
other
christian
i
cant
speak
for
cathol
and
orthodox
but
i
believ
they
also
attempt
to
avoid
have
member
who
simpli
repeat
what
they
are
told
i
admit
that
thi
isnt
alway
success
we
certainli
see
young
peopl
join
our
church
becaus
at
that
age
parent
expect
it
but
most
of
our
member
do
seem
quit
abl
and
will
to
make
judgement
for
themselv
and
have
a
commit
that
come
out
of
their
own
experi
unfortun
it
the
natur
of
usenet
that
doctrin
disagr
get
emphas
so
it
look
like
we
spend
most
of
our
time
deal
with
doctrin
that
certainli
not
my
experi
of
the
way
christian
realli
