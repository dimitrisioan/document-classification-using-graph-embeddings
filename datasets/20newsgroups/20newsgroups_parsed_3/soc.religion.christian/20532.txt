i
thought
i
would
comment
on
thi
in
articl
daniel
segard
write
what
is
the
object
to
celebr
of
easter
it
is
celebr
of
the
resurrect
of
jesu
i
dont
recal
a
command
in
scriptur
for
u
to
celebr
the
resurrect
but
it
is
the
sole
and
onli
reason
that
we
are
christianshow
could
we
not
celebr
it
if
it
is
onli
the
name
not
quit
correct
biblic
teach
expect
u
to
celebr
the
resurrect
of
christ
not
onc
a
year
but
everi
time
someon
is
baptiz
col
buri
with
him
in
baptism
wherein
also
ye
are
risen
with
him
through
the
faith
of
the
oper
of
god
who
hath
rais
him
from
the
dead
rom
therefor
we
are
buri
with
him
in
baptism
into
death
that
like
a
christ
wa
rais
up
from
the
dead
by
the
glori
of
the
father
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
new
of
life
those
realli
want
to
celebr
the
resurrect
should
by
faith
walk
in
new
of
life
after
baptism
it
is
not
necessari
to
celebr
a
pagan
goddess
in
the
process
so
a
we
see
from
scriptur
those
who
are
of
israel
will
observ
the
th
day
forev
the
gentil
who
believ
in
the
messiah
of
israel
are
welcom
to
observ
the
th
day
a
well
but
it
is
not
requir
of
them
sinc
the
are
adopt
into
the
commonwealth
of
israel
the
gentil
who
are
graft
into
the
commonwealth
of
israel
are
onli
requir
to
observ
the
basic
command
given
to
those
who
came
befor
abram
see
also
act
no
further
requir
are
place
upon
them
onc
they
come
to
faith
in
messiah
so
from
thi
i
infer
that
there
are
differ
rule
for
christian
of
jewish
descent
what
happen
to
there
is
neither
jew
nor
greek
slave
nor
free
male
nor
femal
for
all
are
one
in
christ
jesu
jewish
christiansmessian
may
find
certain
form
of
worship
and
certain
disciplin
meaning
becaus
of
their
cultur
background
but
i
have
a
hard
time
understand
the
justif
for
appli
rule
or
command
to
those
who
have
been
justifi
by
grace
through
faith
in
jesu
christ
paul
answer
your
question
in
roman
in
v
he
state
that
the
adopt
the
glori
the
coven
the
give
of
the
law
the
servic
of
god
and
the
promis
were
given
to
the
israelit
it
is
a
packag
deal
he
goe
on
to
identifi
those
who
are
true
israelit
v
make
it
plain
that
the
true
israelit
are
not
those
who
are
born
that
way
but
those
who
accept
the
promis
of
god
paul
continu
to
emphas
that
he
wa
an
israelit
in
cor
then
in
gal

say
that
all
those
who
belong
to
christ
are
abraham
seed
and
heir
to
all
the
promis
given
to
the
israelit
the
promis
come
with
the
law
it
is
all
or
noth
whi
is
it
that
you
onli
want
to
discard
one
part
