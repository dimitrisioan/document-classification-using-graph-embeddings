question
pardon
me
if
thi
is
the
wrong
newsgroup
i
would
describ
myself
a
an
agnost
in
so
far
a
im
sure
there
is
no
singl
univers
suprem
be
but
if
there
is
one
and
it
is
just
we
will
sure
be
judg
on
whether
we
live
good
live
strive
to
achiev
that
good
that
is
within
the
power
of
each
of
u
now
the
complic
is
that
one
of
my
best
friend
ha
becom
veri
fundamentalist
that
would
normal
be
a
nonissu
with
me
but
he
feel
it
is
hi
respons
to
proselyt
me
which
i
guess
it
is
accord
to
hi
faith
thi
is
a
great
strain
to
our
friendship
i
would
have
no
problem
if
the
subject
didnt
come
up
but
when
it
doe
the
discus
quickli
begin
to
offend
both
of
u
he
is
offend
becaus
i
call
into
question
hi
bedrock
belief
i
am
offend
by
what
i
feel
is
a
subscript
to
superstit
ration
by
such
circular
argument
a
the
bibl
is
god
word
becaus
he
tell
u
in
the
bibl
that
it
is
so
so
my
question
is
how
can
i
convinc
him
that
thi
is
a
subject
better
left
undiscuss
so
we
can
preserv
what
is
in
all

other
than
religi
belief
a
