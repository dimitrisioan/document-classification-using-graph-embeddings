re
homosexu
issu
in
christiani
ofm
write
thi
is
an
issu
throughout
the
presbyterian
church
on
the
other
side
one
of
the
major
church
in
cincinnati
ha
been
ordain
homosexu
elder
and
ha
ignor
presbyteri
instruct
not
to
do
so
and
the
church
in
rochest
where
the
judici
commiss
said
they
couldnt
instal
a
homosexu
pastor
ha
made
her
an
evangelist
these
situat
a
well
a
the
one
you
describ
do
not
appear
to
be
stabl
thi
will
certainli
be
a
major
topic
for
the
gener
assembl
next
month
if
the
church
cant
come
up
with
a
solut
that
will
let
peopl
live
with
each
other
i
think
were
end
up
with
a
split
clearli
neither
side
want
that
but
i
think
well
get
push
into
it
by
action
of
both
side
clh
the
moder
of
the
gener
assembl
the
rev
john
fife
visit
our
church
about
a
week
ago
just
day
after
rev
spahrit
been
a
busi
week
for
our
small
church
he
wa
ask
specif
about
the
issu
of
homosexu
and
what
he
think
will
happen
at
the
ga
meet
next
month
evid
there
are
known
resolut
pend
that
rang
the
gamut
from
outlaw
homosexu
altogeth
to
legal
it
complet
he
will
readili
admit
that
thi
is
probabali
the
most
difficult
issu
that
the
church
ha
had
to
deal
with
sinc
the
presbyterian
church
split
in
two
over
the
issu
of
slaveri
more
than
year
ago
without
question
the
issu
may
split
the
church
again
after
weve
been
reunit
for
all
of
a
dozen
year
or
so
he
is
hope
that
it
will
not
and
is
push
the
same
attitud
that
help
the
church
deal
with
the
abort
issu
last
year
a
a
solut
he
is
hope
to
pa
a
resolut
that
more
or
le
state
that
we
the
member
of
the
church
agre
to
disagre
on
the
issu
admit
that
both
side
have
honestli
studi
the
scriptur
and
had
the
spirit
lead
them
to
differ
conclus
it
work
last
year
when
the
abort
issu
threaten
to
do
more
or
le
the
same
thing
and
he
is
hope
that
the
ga
can
foster
a
love
and
care
attitud
about
peopl
who
disagre
with
their
own
view

fm
it

for
the

on

of
washington
grand
torino
seattl
wa
it
go
to
be
hard
to
agre
to
disagre
if
we
allow
disagr
then
some
presbyteri
and
church
are
go
to
ordain
peopl
that
other
will
not
recogn
that
a
difficult
situat
in
a
connect
church
i
could
live
with
it
but
i
think
a
lot
of
peopl
would
not
be
will
to
note
that
the
church
wa
not
will
to
live
with
thi
kind
of
compromis
with
ordin
of
woman
the
one
thing
that
will
definit
prevent
a
person
from
becom
a
presbyterian
minist
is
if
they
indic
that
they
dont
accept
ordin
of
woman
the
argument
is
that
we
cant
have
half
the
church
not
accept
the
leader
of
the
other
half
mayb
peopl
will
decid
to
live
with
it
in
thi
case
when
they
didnt
in
the
other
but
i
wonder
i
admit
that
my
own
presbyteri
submit
an
overtur
to
the
ga
that
would
have
exactli
thi
effect
and
we
consid
the
ambigu
better
than
the
current
situat
