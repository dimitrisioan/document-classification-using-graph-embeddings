my
advic
is
thi
if
you
know
someon
that
you
have
the
hot
for
who
is
not
a
christian
befriend
them
and
tri
to
develop
just
a
friendship
with
them
at
the
same
time
wit
and
share
the
gospel
with
them
not
so
that
you
can
date
them
but
so
that
they
can
be
save
onc
they
becom
a
christian
then
it
is
quit
possibl
to
let
the
relationship
progress
beyond
friendship
howev
if
they
dont
accept
christ
you
still
have
a
good
friendship
and
you
havent
wast
a
lot
of
emot
energi
and
gotten
hurt
while
i
agre
with
most
of
jon
say
i
delet
those
part
of
cours
i
have
seriou
reserv
about
thi
advic
maintain
a
just
friend
level
of
relationship
is
much
easier
said
than
done
peopl
usual
end
up
get
hurt
thi
is
especi
like
to
happen
when
they
start
off
with
feel
of
attract
when
peopl
feel
attract
those
feel
can
cloud
their
judgement
ive
had
the
experi
of
go
quickli
from
believ
that
i
shouldnt
date
nonchristian
to
believ
that
date
thi
man
would
be
okay
to
believ
that
premarit
sex
is
fine
when
peopl
realli
love
each
other
when
the
relationship
end
my
belief
immedi
return
to
their
origin
state
thi
is
an
especi
extrem
case
becaus
i
wa
young
and
away
from
home
and
fellowship
i
dont
think
it
would
work
exactli
thi
way
for
most
peopl
howev
it
import
not
to
underestim
the
power
of
feel
of
attract
