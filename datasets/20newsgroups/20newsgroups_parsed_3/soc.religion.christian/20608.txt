lot
of
stuff

by
ani
other
name
in
modern
parlanc
whi
is
there
so
much
object
to
observ
the

of
the
week
on
which

occur
whi
jump
it
all
over

doe
whi
not
just
go
with
the
sunday
follow
passov
the
way
the
bibl
ha
it
whi
seek
after
unbibl
method
in
fact
that
is
the
reason
easter
jump
all
over
the
calendar
passsov
itself
is
a
lunar
holiday
not
a
solar
one
and
thu
fall
over
a
wide
possibl
span
of
time
the
few
time
that
easter
doe
not
fall
dure
or
after
passov
are
becaus
easter
is
further
link
to
the
vernal
equinox
the
begin
of
spring
more
delet
so
what
doe
thi
question
have
to
do
with
easter
the
whore
goddess
i
am
all
for
celebr
the
resurrect
just
keep
that
whore
out
of
the
discus
your
ob
with
the
term
whore
cloud
your
argument
whore
is
a
valu
judgement
not
a
descript
term
more
delet
overal
thi
argument
is
an
illustr
of
the
etymolog
fallaci
see
jp
louw
semant
of
nt
greek
that
is
the
idea
that
the
true
mean
of
a
word
lie
in
it
origin
and
linguist
form
in
fact
our
own
experi
demonstr
that
the
mean
of
a
word
is
bound
up
with
how
it
is
use
not
where
it
came
from
veri
few
modern
peopl
would
make
ani
connect
whatsoev
between
easter
and
ishtar
if
daniel
seagard
doe
then
for
him
it
ha
that
mean
but
that
is
a
highli
idiosyncrat
mean
and
not
one
that
need
much
refut
