here
is
a
repli
to
one
of
the
letter
seem
to
me
that
atheist
do
not
like
the
doctrin
of
hell
there
noth
like
a
preacher
to
put
fear
into
an
ignor
man
if
god
hadnt
creat
hell
in
the
first
place
there
be
no
no
need
to
die
and
save
u
isnt
it
also
a
bit
paradox
to
say
god
die
when
in
fact
no
such
thing
is
remot
possibl
can
the
infinit
die
your
use
th
centuri
concept
to
interpret
st
centuri
writer
of

in

termonolog
god
could
not
ceas
to
exist
howev
that
is
not
what
death
ever
mean
in
the
scriptur
if
you
will
studi
the
word
you
will
see
that
it
signifi
separ
death
is
separ
not
ceastat
thi
is
the
reason
for
the
agoni
of
the
cross
for
the
first
time
in
etern
one
member
of
the
godhead
wa
separ
from
the

adu
that
to
me
wa
death
it
wa
separ
from
that
which

made
me
whole
death
is
separ
and
etern
death
is
etern
separ
from
hi
fellowship
not
becaus
he
chose
to
send
you
into
outer
dark
but
becaus
you
chose
to
go
there
did
you
know
that
jesu
talk
more
about
hell
than
he
did
about
heaven
thank
you
for
thi
info
what
respect
i
had
for
the
man
now
ha
been
diminish
tenfold
i
promis
never
again
to
say
how
wise
or
love
thi
man
wa
when
i
rebel
against
my
earthli
father
he
spank
me
i
found
no
wisdom
in
that
until
i
had
grown
older
and
especi
until
i
had
my
own
child
he
wa
tri
to
guid
me
away
from
hurt
that
would
enter
my
life
if
i
continu
on
my
suicid
cours
he
did
it
in
love
though
i
interpret
it
a
harsh
and
unlov
if
god
warn
of
impend
danger
that
is
love
if
choos
to
let
u
do
a
we
plea
and
then
at
the
end
tell
u
the
rule
that
would
be
harsh
you
have
a
conscienc
no
matter
how
calus
or
fallen
it
is
that
wit
to
you
that
a
thing
is
wrong
and
that
there
is
caus
for
fear
be
jesu
wa
allegedli
god
i
doubt
he
could
honestli
feel
the
pinprick
man
dealt
him
thi
may
give
light
to
the
error
of
your
understand
one
must
have
correct
knowledg
in
order
to
have
correct
faith
faith
and
knowledg
are
insepar
jesu
most
certainli
felt
the
pinprick
of
life
a
the
scriptur
say
heb
for
we
do
not
have
a
high
priest
who
can
not
sympath
with
our
weak
but
one
who
ha
been
tempt
in
all
thing
a
we
are
yet
without
sin
the
kenosi
passag
of
phil
state
that
he
gave
up
hi
godhead
attribut
when
he
took
upon
himself
human
it
ha
been
a
favorit
medit
of
mine
to
think
about
thi
it
wa
to
be
my
phd
thesi
the
conscious
of
christ
i
have
talk
at
length
with
a
great
mani
peopl
about
thi
interest
studi
includ
clh
it
is
my
concluss
that
a
jesu
the
nd
member
of
the
triniti
actual
suffer
a
we
do
he
becam
part
of
the
human
race
and
experienc
it
a
we
do
he
grew
in
knowledg
he
chose
not
to
grasp
hi
omnisci
but
chose
to
be
taught
it
is
my
understand
that
he
wa
led
of
the
spirit
to
such
an
extent
that
sometim
it
is
hard
to
distinquish
between
jesu
the
man
and
jesu
a
god
but
in
jn
where
the
adulter
woman
wa
thrown
befor
him
the
ten
are
quit
clear
in
that
the
whole
situat
took
him
by
surpris
that
is
he
wa
not
awar
that
thi
event
wa
to
take
place
in
time
he
wa
live
sequenti
histori
a
you
or
i
mayb
some
other
time
we
can
discus
thi
but
it
is
a
veri
lengthi
discus
and
one
that
caus
the
curcuit
breaker
of
the
brain
to
pop
more
often
than
not
thank
again
for
the
info
just
so
you
know
some
friend
and
i
are
start
a
freethink
organ
and
im
go
to
use
some
of
the
info
you
provid
for
an
organ
intro
duction
i
wa
onc
a
member
of
that
club
the
free
thinker
is
a
gloriou
ideal
by
contrast
of
cours
you
believ
that
the
believ
is
the
unforun
repositori
of
everyth
that
is
dogmat
inhibit
reactionari
and
repress
i
find
such
a
stanc
to
be
a
amus
a
it
is
absurd
if
the
liber
humanist
wish
to
critic
a
christian
or
a
buddhist
or
a
marxist
that
is
hi
right
but
what
he
must
not
pretend
is
that
he
wa
led
to
thi
sole
by
hi
ration
doubt
when
in
fact
he
wa
led
to
it
by
hi
faith
he
must
acknowledg
that
while
it
is
ration
doubt
for
him
a
a
free
thinker
to
critic
the
christian
it
might
equal
be
a
ration
doubt
for
the
christian
to
critic
him
a
a
humanist
if
there
is
no
faith
there
can
be
no
dout
there
is
no
faith
which
can
not
choos
to
cast
doubt
on
some
other
faith
pascal
point
out
that
sceptic
argument
allow
the
posit
to
be
posit
few
speak
dubious
of
sceptic
the
fact
that
skeptic
are
not
skeptic
about
skeptic
is
further
evid
that
to
doubt
anyth
we
must
believ
in
someth

the
person
who
is
skeptic
toward
one
faith
or
even
most
faith
will
be
the
devot
adher
of

in
fact
it
is
a
measur
of
hi

both
that

that
he
can
defin
himself

some

claim

and
argu
vocifer
for
complet

in
my
campu
ministri
i
ran
across
thi
more
time
than
i
care
to

howev
they
disprov
their

that
they
use

their

to

though
silent
that
is
to
say
that
complet

arbitrari
next

each

choos
what
he
is
skeptic
about
and
what
he
believ
without
skeptic
to
stress
thi
is
to
belabor
the
obviou
but
it
underlin
the
point
that
no
one
can
know
exhaust
how
he
know
what
he
know
pure
objectiv
is
a
myth
and
complet

an
impossibl
the
answer
to
thi
impass
lie
in
a

way
of
know
one
which
is
base

if

befor
it
is

the

on

i
tell
you
what

he
is
unworthi
