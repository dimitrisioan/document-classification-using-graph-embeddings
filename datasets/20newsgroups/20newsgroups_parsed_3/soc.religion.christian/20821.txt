write
for
exampl
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
at
all
must
there
be
a
whi
to

i
ask
becaus
of
what
you
also
assum
about
god
name
that
he
just
exist
with
no
whi
to
hi
exist
so
the
question
is
revers
whi
cant
we
assum
the
univers
just
exist
a
you
assum
god
to
just
exist
whi
must
there
be
a
whi
to
the
univers
whether
there
is
a
whi
or
not
we
have
to
find
it
thi
is
pascal
wager
if
there
is
no
whi
and
we
spend
our
live
search
then
we
have
mere
wast
our
live
which
were
meaningless
anyway
if
there
is
a
whi
and
we
dont
search
for
it
then
we
have
wast
our
potenti
meaning
live
suppos
the
univers
is
billion
year
old
and
suppos
it
last
anoth
billion
year
suppos
i
live
to
be
that
is
noth
that
is
so
small
that
it
is
scari
so
by
search
for
the
whi
along
with
my
friend
here
on
earth
if
noth
el
we
arent
so
scare
what
if
you
woke
up
at
a
parti
with
no
memori
and
everyon
wa
discus
who
the
host
might
be
there
might
not
be
a
host
you
say
i
say
let
go
find
him
the
parti
go
to
be
over
sometim
mayb
hell
let
u
stay
becaus
we
recogn
our
own
mortal
we
have
to
find
the
whi
well
then
buddhism
confucian
taoism
hinduism
judaism
zoeraster
shintoism
and
islam
should
fit
thi
bit
of
logic
quit
nice
all
have
depth
all
have
endur
valu
thu
all
must
be
true
thi
is
a
good
point
but
more
of
a
good
point
for
studi
religion
than
ignor
it
some
christian
disagre
with
me
but
it
is
worthwhil
to
studi
differ
religion
and
philosophi
and
glean
the
truth
from
them
to
quot
of
cours
out

test
