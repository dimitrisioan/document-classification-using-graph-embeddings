tend
to
refer
to
group
that
do
deni
the
triniti
they
explain
matthew
by
say
that
jesu
is
the
name
of
the

jesu
is
the

and

refer
to
differ
role
all
fill
by
jesu
imho
thi
are
go
from
bad
to
wors
in
in
wa
bad
enough
i
do
not
like
a
god
who
pray
to
himself
i
refus
to
believ
jesu
pray
to
himself
let
get
real
if
the
scriptur
say
he
pray
to
the
father
then
the
father
is
someon
differ
than
the
son
i
have
no
problem
with
multipl
god
to
me
the
whole
context
of
the
scriptur
say
be
perfect
even
a
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
that
we
can
be
coheir
with
christ
that
we
will
be
like
him
coheir
share
all
thing
equallyinclud
knowledg
power
dominion
etc
when
i
am
like
him
christ
i
will
be
the
same
a
he
isand
he
is
a
god
if
god
can
not
do
thi
the
hi
is
not
all
powerfuland
he
is
not
god
if
he
will
not
he
is
a
liarand
he
is
not
god
but
if
he
doe
he
is
the
greatest
of
all
the
god
i
dont
know
of
anyon
who
say
that
jesu
pray
to
himself
the
whole
point
of
the
triniti
is
that
there
enough
of
a
distinct
within
god
that
relationship
is
possibl
thi
impli
some
sort
of
commun
i
assum
that
in
their
nativ
form
the
father
and
son
are
directli
enough
connect
that
prayer
in
our
sens
isnt
involv
but
jesu
is
the
incarn
of
the
son
ie
the
logo
made
flesh
when
he
in
a
human
form
hi
human
action
are
limit
to
human
capabl
so
commun
with
the
father
take
the
form
of
prayer
i
dont
see
that
there
anyth
problemat
about
that
it
seem
to
be
implicit
in
the
whole
idea
of
incarn
