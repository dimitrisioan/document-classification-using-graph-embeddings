feel

way
thu
the
reason
that
the

in

memori
a
is
clearli
shown
by
thi

the
church
teach
on
capit
punish
remain
today
a
it
ha
alway
been
in
the
past
in
total
accord
with
my
sentiment
that
i
do
not
disagre
with
the
use
of
deadli
forc
in
those
case
for
which
thi
option
is
justifi
so
what
is
justifi
a
you
state
veri
explicitli
from
the
new

the
onli
justifi
case
is
when
it
is
necessari
to
keep
the
peac
sinc
that
doe
not
appli
at
all
to
thi
countri
the
logic
conclus
base
on
your
own
premis
is
that
one
must
be
oppos
to
ani
form
of
