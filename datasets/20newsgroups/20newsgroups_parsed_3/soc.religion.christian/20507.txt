thoma
randal
write
ye
i
suppos
it
is
true
that
peopl
make
mistak
it
is
interest
to
note
that
in
those
long
ago
ot
day
if
you
werent
correct
in
your
propheci
peopl
got
veri
mad
and
you
were
no
longer
believ
even
put
to
death
thi
is
one
of
the
differ
between
ot
propheci
and
nt
propheci
in
the
nt
it
is
expect
that
when
believ
gather
peopl
will
prophesi
the
propheci
must
be
judg
cor
there
is
noth
about
kill
someon
who
make
a
mistak
to
say
that
we
make
mistak
is
true
to
say
that
we
make
mistak
while
fill
with
the
spirit
is
not
true
were
that
true
the
entir
bibl
have
been
written
by
men
inspir
by
god
would
be
subject
also
to
those
error
for
what
is
propheci
but
like
those
revel
given
in
scriptur
scriptur
is
scriptur
there
is
no
gift
of
scriptur
and
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
know
that
i
have
made
mistak
while
fill
with
the
spirit
if
you
dont
give
grace
to
allow
peopl
to
make
mistak
they
will
never
grow
in
the
use
of
the
spiritu
gift
when
we
minist
in
my
small
group
i
encourag
peopl
to
speak
out
ani
impress
or
imag
they
think
might
be
from
the
lord
onli
by
tri
will
they
know
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
and
in
either
case
theyll
have
a
better
handl
on
it
the
next
time
didnt
you
fall
when
you
were
learn
to
ride
a
bicycl
but
you
kept
on
tri
and
you
learn
both
from
your
failur
and
your
success
spiritu
gift
are
no
differ
you
get
better
with
experi
which
bring
me
around
to
ask
an
open
question
is
the
bibl
a
close
book
of
scriptur
is
it
okay
for
u
to
go
around
say
god
told
me
thi
and
jesu
told
me
that
wouldnt
that
impli
that
god
is
still
pour
out
new
revel
to
u
i
know
that
some
peopl
will
feel
that
is
okay
and
some
will
not
the
concept
of
a
close
canon
would
certainli
cast
a
shadow
on
contemporari
prophet
on
the
other
hand
an
open
canon
seem
to
be
indic
sometim
the
canon
of
scriptur
is
complet
doe
thi
mean
that
god
no
longer
speak
i
have
heard
hi
voic
not
audibl
though
some
have
but
clearli
nonetheless
is
what
i
heard
equival
to
scriptur
no
i
have
never
heard
contemporari
prophet
claim
that
what
they
receiv
from
the
lord
is
on
the
same
level
a
scriptur
on
the
contrari
those
who
are
matur
obey
the
scriptur
by
submit
their
propheci
to
fellow
believ
for
judgement
and
the
most
reliabl
yardstick
for
judg
propheci
is
certainli
the
scriptur
themselv
the
canon
is
close
but
god
is
not
silent
also
interest
to
note
is
that
some
so
call
propheci
are
noth
new
but
rather
an
inspir
translat
of
scriptur
is
it
right
to
call
that
propheci
mislead
wouldnt
that
be
more
have
to
do
with
knowledg
i
know
the
gift
of
knowledg
may
not
be
a
excit
to
talk
about
but
shouldnt
we
call
a
hors
a
hors
doe
it
matter
what
it
is
call
the
question
is
not
how
to
label
it
but
how
to
receiv
it
word
of
knowledg
incident
are
similar
to
propheci
and
sometim
the
two
overlap
but
gener
it
is
supernatur
knowledg
of
some
fact
that
could
not
be
known
