how
i
talk
to
nonchristian
who
are
complain
about
hell
me
do
you
believ
your
go
to
heaven
him
i
dont
believ
in
heaven
me
so
are
you
go
there
him
if
there
wa
a
heaven
i
would
me
but
sinc
there
isnt
a
heaven
your
not
go
there
are
you
him
no
the
point
is
that
heaven
is
base
on
faithif
you
dont
believ
in
heaven
there
no
way
your
go
to
be
in
it
hmmm
peopl
in
the
america
befor
the
time
of
christ
child
who
die
young
etc
of
cours
the
next
step
is
i
dont
believ
in
hell
either
so
whi
will
i
be
there
it
seem
to
me
that
hell
is
etern
death
and
seper
from
god
but
of
cours
the
popular
concept
of
hell
correct
or
incorrect
is
someth
akin
to
etern
perpetu
of
conscious
at
the
veri
least
most
atheist
do
believ
that
when
they
die
they
will
die
forev
and
never
see
godso
they
do
in
fact
believ
that
theyr
go
to
hell
i
think
a
good
number
of
atheist
believ
there
is
noth
beyond
bodili
death
but
it
is
simpli
an
abus
of
languag
to
say
they
believ
theyr
go
to
hell
they
believ
theyr
go
to
die
understand
that
youv
turn
hell
into
a
verb
use
the
same
logic
it
also
follow
that
all
anim
are
go
to
hell
are
you
sure
thi
is
what
you
want
to
say
presum
anim
dont
have
the
opportun
to
get
to
heaven
but
thi
still
doesnt
chang
the
fact
that
theyr
go
to
hell
die
a
final
death
i
dont
claim
to
know
whether
or
not
there
is
an
afterlif
of
some
sort
but
if
hell
is
a
you
describ
final
death
and
not
etern
perpetu
of
conscious
it
will
be
true
that
there
will
never
be
a
moment
when
i
am
awar
of
my
nonexist
assum
i
go
to
hell
and
not
to
heaven
in
other
word
ill
never
know
im
dead
hmmm
hell
doesnt
have
to
be
wors
than
earth
to
be
hellbecaus
it
etern
ever
hear
peopl
say
of
a
love
one
who
wa
ill
and
ha
die
at
least
she
not
suffer
ani
more
she
in
heaven
now
consid
the
follow
statement
at
least
she
not
suffer
ani
more
she
in
hell
now
the
abov
statement
sound
odd
but
accord
to
your
definit
of
hell
it
would
be
a
true
statement
the
person
in
hell
would
not
be
suffer
grant
they
wouldnt
be
anyth
wouldnt
be
have
ani
consciou
experi
whatsoev
you
say
hell
death
is
etern
howev
thi
lose
it
mean
to
a
dead
person
and
to
me
it
seem
that
the
threat
of
some
sort
of
etern
punish
onli
make
senseha
forc
if
one
expect
to
be
consciou
throughout
thi
etern
mani
atheist
believ
that
the
thirst
for
an
afterlif
is
simpli
the
product
of
propaganda
friend
do
you
want
the
free
gift
of
etern
life
it
my
understand
that
the
earli
jew
did
not
believ
in
an
afterlif
can
anyon
back
me
up
on
thi
combin
with
the
surviv
instinct
all
anim
share
the
differ
is
we
have
conscious
and
onc
we
get
the
idea
of
etern
life
drill
into
our
brain
we
then
desir
a
sort
of
supersurviv
and
it
a
lot
wors
than
heaven
that
the
onli
comparison
that
matter
that
would
depend
on
what
heaven
is
like
if
god
is
a
king
and
an
etern
in
heaven
consist
of
give
thank
and
prais
to
the
king
i
might
opt
for
hell
i
read
a
