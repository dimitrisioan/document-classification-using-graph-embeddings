for

they

church
nondenomin
church
seem
to
view
the
use
a
a

a
mere
option
but
recommend
koberg
just
a
coupl
of
minor
correct
here
the
church
of
christ
do
not
usual
believ
in
speak
in
tongu
in
fact
mani
of
them
are
known
for
be
strongli
oppos
to
pentecost
teach
you
are
probabl
think
of
church
of
god
in
christ
the
largest
africanamerican
pentecost
denomin
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
signifi
believ
but
it
should
be
point
out
that
the
assembl
of
god
doe
not
now
nor
ha
it
ever
held
that
speak
in
tongu
is
the
sign
that
one
is
a
christian
the
doctrin
that
tradit
pentecost
includ
the
ag
maintain
is
that
speak
in
tongu
is
the
sign
of
a
second
experi
after
becom
a
christian
in
which
one
is
baptiz
in
the
holi
spirit
that
may
be
what
you
were
refer
to
but
i
point
thi
out
becaus
pentecost
are
frequent
label
a
believ
that
you
have
to
speak
in
tongu
in
order
to
be
a
christian
such
a
posit
is
onli
held
by
some
group
and
not
the
major
of
pentecost
mani
pentecost
will
quot
the
passag
in
mark
about
these
sign
follow
them
that
believ
but
they
gener
do
not
interpret
thi
a
mean
if
you
dont
pactic
the
sign
you
arent
save
i
know
it
hard
to
summar
the
belief
of
a
movement
that
ha
such
diver
but
i
think
youv
made
some
pretti
big
gener
here
do
neopentecost
onli
believ
in
tongu
a
a
sign
and
tongu
a
prayer
but
not
tongu
a
revelatori
with
a
messag
ive
never
heard
of
that
befor
in
fact
i
would
have
character
them
a
believ
the
same
a
pentecost
except
le
like
to
see
tongu
a
a
sign
of
spirit
baptism
also
while
neopentecost
may
not
be
inclin
to
speak
in
tongu
in
the
nonpentecost
church
they
attend
they
do
have
their
