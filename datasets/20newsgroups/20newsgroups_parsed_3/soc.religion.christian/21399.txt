if
we

would
appear

believ

i
dont

if

in

the
oldest
list
i
know
of
sirach
and
the
other
are
discus
by
the
father
a
scriptur
but
not
unanim
true
not
all
accept
them
a
scriptur
though
niether
were
all
the
book
of
the
new
testament
so
accept
which
put
to
the
lie
the
whole
argument
of
the
book
be
exclud
becaus
they
were
debat
and
not
univers
accept
hebrew
the
apocalyps
peter
esther
and
other
were
debat
at
variou
time
but
eventu
retain
a

you
mention
both
vaticanu
and
sinaitcu
includ
the
deuterocanon
both
of
the

i
think
inlcud

it
deal

onli
though
it
is

valuabl
in

my
interim
conclus
is
that
protest
exclus
of
at

one
of
these
write
is
one
of
those
tradit
of

one
hear

at

of

at
which
council
the
same
list
wa
enumer
with
the
word
becaus
we
have
reciev
from
the
father
that
these
are
the
book
to

in

which
ought
to
quiet

there
wa
never

doubt
in

a
the

church
doe
in
remov
the
deuterocanon
from
the
realm
of

though
the
episcopalian
hold
them
in
high
regard
and
read
them
in
the
church
they
are
not
count
a
scriptur
by
them
and
may
not
be
use
to
prove

the
lutheran
hold
out
similarli
earlier
mention

a

a

call
it

that
could
be
found
among

and
thi
is
the
reason
whi
the
law
of
the

is
reckon
a
consist
of
twentytwo

so
that
they
may
correspond
