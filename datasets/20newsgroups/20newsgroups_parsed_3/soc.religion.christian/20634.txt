murray
write
on
palm
sunday
at
our
parish
we
were
invit
to
take
the
role
of
jesu
in
the
passion
i
declin
to
particip
last
year
at
the
liturgi
meet
i
point
out
how
we
crucifi
christ
by
our
sin
so
therefor
it
is
appropri
that
we
retain
the
role
of
the
crowd
but
to
no
avail
musician
reader
and
so
on
new
thing
are
introduc
in
the
cours
of
the
liturgi
and
sinc
no
one
know
what
happen
the
new
thing
have
to
be
explain
and
pretti
soon
instead
of
do
a
lot
of
the
mass
were
just
sit
there
listen
or
space
out
in
my
case
to
how
the
mass
is
about
to
be
done
in
my
mind
i
lay
the
blame
on
liturgi
committe
made
up
of
lay
peopl
to
be
awar
of
the
lord
presenc
a
a
former
cathol
and
now
a
a
veri
activ
lutheran
it
is
some
of
the
innov
of
the
mass
which
made
me
leav
the
cathol
church
and
return
to
the
more
tradit
cathol
chuch
the
lutheran
i
spent
mani
year
a
a
lector
read
the
passion
part
a
appropri
in
the
cathol
church
and
i
found
it
veri
meaning
our
lutheran
parish
just
institut
the
tenebra
servic
for
good
friday
and
i
wa
the
lector
for
a
paraphras
passion
which
wa
except
i
heard
and
learn
thing
that
i
have
previous
overlook
in
the
gospel
yet
those
fact
were
alway
there
a
a
matter
of
interest
the
pastor
and
i
were
talk
about
the
differ
between
the
rc
and
lutheran
church
dure
holi
week
over
breakfast
easter
sunday
a
a
member
of
a
liturgi
committe
i
can
tell
you
that
the
problem
is
certain
peopl
domin
who
want
to
tri
out
all
kind
of
innov
the
priest
dont
seem
even
to
want
to
make
ani
decis
of
their
own
in
mani
case
i
guess
it
easier
to
tri
someth
new
than
it
is
to
refus
to
allow
it
my
wife
is
the
member
of
the
liturgi
committe
in
the
famili
call
music
and
worship
at
our
church
our
pastor
doe
have
control
of
thi
committe
but
listen
veri
care
to
the
committe
suggest
it
need
a
strong
hand
to
lead
and
guid
to
keep
the
intent
and
the
messag
clear
and
strong
a
it
should
be
through
lent
and
the
rest
of
the
liturg
year
addit
reason
for
my
leav
the
cathol
faith
lack
of
ani
selfless
spiritu
guidanc
by
priest
in
my
parish
aka
wishywashi
a
you
may
gather
from
my
comment
i
feel
that
it
is
veri
import
ir
regardless
of
denomin
guidelin
to
have
a
servicemass
which
promot
the
true
reason
that
we
are
gather
there
i
am
quit
comfort
in
a
tradit
mass
with
receiv
holi
communion
on
the
tongu
the
sacrament
of
penanc
not
reconcili
station
of
the
cross
so
on
and
so
forth
the
reason
other
type
of
mass
and
parish
exist
is
becaus
these
feel
are
not
share
by
everyon
i
want
more
peopl
to
attend
church
and
to
find
the
lord
but
i
dont
want
them
attend
a
show
it
not
my
church
work
hard
to
have
a
meaning
servic
dure
lent
on
wednesday
but
follow
tradit
lutheran
book
of
worship
guidelin
where
thing
are
chang
or
omit
dure
lent
such
a
the
hymn
of
prais
it
is
note
so
that
we
are
awar
of
the
reason
that
it
is
not
there
quit
frankli
it
is
veri
hard
for
a
noncathol
to
go
to
a
mass
and
fit
in
my
dear
wife
never
could
former
methodist
and
holi
week
mass
and
vigil
would
intimid
the
daylight
out
of
a
noncathol
those
cathol
who
have
bear
with
me
thi
far
understand
what
i
mean
plea
keep
in
mind
whi
we
are
there
to
gather
togeth
in
worship
not
to
worri
about
how
someth
is
done
or
not
done
if
there
is
someth
wrong
that
you
feel
need
address
by
all
mean
talk
to
your
priest
or
pastor
i
have
onli
ever
met
one
who
wouldnt
listen
they
are
there
to
provid
spiritu
guidanc
and
to
help
use
them
my
differ
with
the
cathol
church
are
much
more
fundament
but
my
decis
to
chang
faith
wa
done
with
prayer
intervent
and
session
with
priest
and
minist
in
christ
kershner

wyatt
my
opinion
are
my
own
and
