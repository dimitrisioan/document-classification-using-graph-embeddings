have
a
question
for
bob
whi
in
the
world
would
ani
selfrespect
atheist
want
to
subscrib
to
a
christian
news
group
i
have
a
difficult
enough
time
keep
up
with
it
and
i
think
i
know
someth
about
the
subject
excus
me
but
what
make
you
think
that
just
becaus
he
atheist
he
doesnt
know
anyth
about
christian
in
my
albeit
limit
experi
atheist
are
often
the
one
who
know
more
about
the
bibl
have
search
it
from
end
to
end
for
answer
i
myself
am
a
christian
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
consid
myself
more
of
an
author
on
my
religion
i
just
have
a
differ
perspect
on
it
more
bias
in
favor
natur
it
seem
quit
obviou
whi
he
is
subscrib
if
i
may
infer
from
what
he
say
he
is
look
for
an
explan
who
are
we
to
question
hi
motif
anyway
at
the
veri
least
although
i
dislik
thi
kind
of
logic
one
could
hope
that
he
will
see
the
light
critcism
will
i
fear
not
give
him
a
veri
posit
pictur
of
christian
bob
remind
me
of
my
roommat
in
order
to
disbeliev
atheism
he
say
he
will
need
to
be
proven
wrong
about
it
well
i
dont
even
wast
my
time
tri
i
tell
him
that
hell
just
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
in
respons
he
tell
me
he
will
say
an
atheist
prayer
for
me
with
regard
to
thi
i
guess
i
dont
realli
feel
sentiment
of
thi
order
can
be
proven
faith
ha
a
lot
to
do
with
it
thi
is
whi
those
who
search
the
bibl
from
cover

doesnt
help
anyon
who
doesnt
alreadi
have

thi
quit
recent
when

quickli
discov
that

could
give
him
noth
more
than
my

and
a
descript
of
my
natur
faith
is
a
