subject
christian
and
holi
thing
ezek
god
seem
to
be
upset
with
the
priest
who
have
made
no
differ
between
the
holi
and
the
profan
thi
brought
to
my
mind
a
sermon
i
heard
recent
in
which
the
speaker
said
god
second
name
doe
not
begin
with
a
d
refer
i
believ
to
use
of
god
holi
name
and
titl
a
swear
word
i
wa
also
remind
of
the
experi
of
mose
at
the
burn
bush
when
god
told
him
take
off
your
sandal
for
the
place
where
you
are
stand
is
holi
ground
these
and
other
text
seem
to
impli
that
god
peopl
must
treat
holi
thing
differ
from
other
common
thing
or
make
a
differ
between
holi
and
common
thing
the
obviou
question
are
what
make
someth
holi
and
how
are
christian
primarili
suppos
to
make
thi
differ
between
holi
and
common
thing
eg
god
name
the
holi
spirit
the
holi
bibl
etc
dariu
