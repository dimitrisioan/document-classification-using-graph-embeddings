i
have
a
strong
prefer
for
edit
that
do
not
indent
the
begin
of
each
vers
a
if
vers
were
paragraph
the
vers
number
is
a
rel
modern
addit
and
should
not
be
given
undu
promin
doe
anyon
know
of
an
english
languag
edit
that
doe
not
show
the
vers
or
even
chapter
number
i
have
alway
thought
that
such
an
edit
would
be
veri
use
although
hard
to
navig
around
i
have
a
scot
nt
that
doesnt
show
vers
number
and
it
is
great
to
read
particularli
longer
narr
passag
but
my
scot
isnt
quit
up
to
do
proper
studi
from
thi
edit
i
tend
to
use
it
to
get
a
feel
for
a
stori
particularli
in
the
gospel
and
then
use
an
english
edit
to
look
for
detail
