write
i
just
thought
id
share
some
word
that
i
receiv
in
a
letter
from
moodi
bibl
institut
a
coupl
of
month
ago
the
word
are
by
jame
m
stowel
the
presid
of
mbi
the
other
day
i
wa
at
the
dri
cleaner
and
the
radio
wa
play
it
caught
my
attent
becaus
a
talk
show
guest
wa
critic
evangel
christian
say
we
believ
in
absolut
and
think
we
are
the
onli
one
who
know
what
the
absolut
are
he
miss
the
point
no
imo
mr
stowel
miss
the
point
we
affirm
the
absolut
of
scriptur
not
becaus
we
are
arrog
moralist
but
becaus
we
believ
in
god
who
is
truth
who
ha
reveal
hi
truth
in
hi
word
and
therefor
we
hold
a
preciou
the
strateg
import
of
those
absolut
mr
stowel
seem
to
have
jump
rather
strang
from
truth
to
absolut
i
dont
see
how
that
necessarili
follow
are
all
truth
also
absolut
is
all
of
scriptur
truth
and
therefor
absolut
if
the
answer
to
either
of
these
question
is
no
then
perhap
you
can
explain
to
me
how
you
determin
which
part
of
scriptur
are
truth
and
which
truth
are
absolut
and
who
is
qualifi
to
make
these
determin
there
is
hardli
consensu
even
in
evangel
christian
not
to
mention
the
rest
of
christian
