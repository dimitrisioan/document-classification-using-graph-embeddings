re
the
doctrin
of
origin
sin
in
articl
write
if
babi
are
not
suppos
to
be
baptis
then
whi
doesnt
the
bibl
ever
say
so
it
never
come
right
and
say
onli
peopl
that
know
right
from
wrong
or
who
are
taught
can
be
baptis
thi
is
not
a
veri
sound
argument
for
baptis
babi
it
assum
that
if
the
bibl
doesnt
say
specif
that
you
dont
need
to
do
someth
then
that
must
mean
that
you
do
need
to
do
it
i
know
there
a
specif
term
for
thi
form
of
logic
but
it
escap
me
right
now
howev
if
it
were
sound
then
you
should
be
abl
to
appli
it
thi
way
if
the
bibl
doesnt
specif
say
that
someth
is
wrong
then
it
must
be
ok
which
coincident
lead
perfectli
into
a
question
ive
often
ponder
thi
is
no
le
logic
than
the
assumpt
that
if
someth
is
not
in
the
bibl
then
it
must
not
be
done
but
i
dont
realli
think
that
what
he
say
anyway
see
below
if
slaveri
is
immor
which
i
believ
it
is
can
i
assum
that
everyon
els
in
thi
group
doe
too
whi
doesnt
jesu
or
ani
of
the
apostl
speak
out
against
it
own
slave
wa
common
practic
back
then
paul
speak
about
everyth
els
that
is
immor
he
appar
thought
it
wa
import
enough
to
talk
about
thing
like
not
be
a
drunkard
whi
doesnt
anyon
mention
slaveri
if
god
moral
are
etern
and
dont
chang
like
the
moral
of
societi
then
it
must
have
been
just
a
immor
then
a
it
is
today
what
about
the
letter
to
philemon
in
it
paul
at
least
hint
that
a
certain
slave
be
releas
also
slaveri
in
those
time
wa
not
the
same
a
the
type
of
slaveri
we
had
in
the
u
i
think
a
better
comparison
would
be
to
indentur
servitud
i
dont
realli
want
to
get
into
a
discuss
on
slaveri
anyway
although
it
doe
demonstr
your
point
i
dont
think
it
is
relev
becaus
the
origin
poster
did
not
say
that
absenc
of
specif
condemen
prof
someth
is
not
immor
back
to
the
origin
poster
assert
he
is
not
in
fact
make
the
logic
error
of
which
you
accus
him
he
state
the
fact
that
the
bibl
doe
not
say
that
babi
can
not
be
baptiz
also
we
know
that
the
bibl
say
that
everyon
must
be
baptiz
to
enter
heaven
everyon
includ
infant
unless
there
is
other
scriptur
to
the
contrari
ie
an
except
sinc
there
is
no
except
list
in
the
bibl
we
must
assum
to
be
on
the
safe
side
that
the
bibl
mean
what
it
say
that
everyon
must
be
baptiz
to
enter
heaven
and
so
we
baptiz
infant
to
summar
you
accus
the
origin
poster
of
say
if
someth
is
not
forbidden
by
the
bibl
then
that
prof
it
is
ok
ie
if
someth
can
not
be
disproven
it
is
true
he
rather
seem
to
be
assert
that
sinc
the
bibl
doe
not
forbid
you
can
not
prove
use
the
bibl
that
it
is
not
ok
there
is
a
differ
between
prove
whether
or
not
someth
can
be
proven
or
disproven
there
are
theori
on
provabl
in
the
field
of
logic
by
the
way
and
actual
prove
or
disprov
it
the
other
logic
error
we
must
avoid
fall
into
is
the
convers
that
if
someth
can
not
be
proven
then
it
is
fals
thi
seem
to
be
the
error
of
mani
sola
scriptura
believ
i
think
the
onli
thing
that
can
be
proven
here
is
that
one
can
not
use
scriptur
alon
to
prove
someth
either
way
about
infant
baptism
although
the
evid
seem
to
me
to
favor
