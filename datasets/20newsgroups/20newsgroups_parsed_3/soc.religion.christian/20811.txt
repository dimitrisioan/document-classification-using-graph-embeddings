re
christian
that
are
not
church
member
in
articl
write
over
the
year
i
have
met
christian
who
are
not
associ
with
ani
local
church
and
are
not
member
of
ani
local
church
thi
is
an
issu
that
may
be
veri
person
but
is
import
what
doe
the
bibl
say
about
thi
and
how
can
we
encourag
our
friend
with
regard
to
thi
issu
thi
bring
up
an
interest
subject
that
ha
not
been
discus
much
and
probabl
ha
not
been
studi
much
a
some
of
you
may
be
awar
ive
post
a
lot
of
articl
late
on
person
type
of
which
the
mbti
is
a
test
vehicl
to
come
up
to
speed
just
read
altpsychologyperson
andor
ask
for
by
person
type
summari
file
one
observ
is
that
peopl
have
significantli
differ
person
no
question
on
thi
which
seem
to
be
essenti
inborn
with
respect
to
church
attend
and
particip
some
peopl
thrive
on
thi
while
other
peopl
have
real
difficulti
with
thi
becaus
they
prefer
a
more
solitari
and
contempl
lifestyl
that
is
they
are
deenerg
if
confront
with
excess
close
to
outsid
activ
and
lot
of
peopl
of
cours
thi
is
measur
by
extroversionintrovers
my
impress
is
that
mani
church
are
total
blind
to
thi
fact
and
creat
environ
that
scare
away
mani
who
are
natur
introvert
there
are
mani
introvert
charact
in
the
bibl
btw
i
know
i
am
quit
introvert
in
prefer
and
find
the
pressur
by
mani
church
to
particip
to
meet
togeth
in
larg
group
etc
to
be
veri
uncomfort
know
what
i
know
now
these
church
have
been
overli
influenc
by
highli
extrovert
peopl
who
thrive
on
thi
sort
of
thing
btw
there
noth
wrong
with
either
extrovers
or
introvers
both
prefer
have
their
place
in
the
bodi
mayb
i
should
defin
extrovertintrovert
more
care
sinc
these
word
are
usual
not
use
correctli
in
our
cultur
the
extrovertintrovert
scale
is
a
measur
of
how
a
person
is
energ
the
follow
is
excerpt
from
my
summari
energ
how
a
person
is
energ
extrovers
e
prefer
for
draw
energi
from
the
outsid
world
of
peopl
activ
or
thing
introvers
i
prefer
for
draw
energi
from
one
intern
world
of
idea
emot
or
impress
hope
thi
will
elicit
further
discus
a
to
how
church
can
structur
themselv
to
meet
the
real
need
of
the
peopl
who
compris
the
bodi
of
christ
instead
of
tri
to
chang
peopl
person
to
fit
them
into
a
particular
framework
im
sure
there
are
other
aspect
of
how
church
have
not
