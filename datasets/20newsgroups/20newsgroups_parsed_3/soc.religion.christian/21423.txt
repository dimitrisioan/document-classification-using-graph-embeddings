stuff
delet
first
point
what
they
are
do
is
wrong
just
a
what
joseph
brother
did
wa
wrong
just
a
what
juda
did
wa
wrong
they
intend
it
for
evil
if
god
somehow
bring
good
out
of
it
that
doe
not
make
them
ani
le
subject
to
just
condemn
and
punish
second
point
of
cours
god
will
bring
good
out
of
it
but
not
the
same
good
that
he
would
have
brought
if
the
serbian
had
refrain
from
the
sin
of
robberi
and
rape
and
murder
nor
doe
the
good
he
purpos
excus
u
from
the
duti
of
do
what
is
right
so
what
your
say
then
is
that
god
exercis
direct
control
or
influenc
upon
human
he
doesnt
control
our
everi
thought
or
action
but
take
what
we
do
whether
it
be
intend
for
evil
or
not
and
turn
it
into
someth
good
it
seem
to
me
that
thi
idea
conflict
with
the
belief
that
god
gave
human
free
will
a
far
a
i
can
determin
it
is
imposs
to
reconcil
these
two
differ
idea
if
god
were
to
exert
hi
influenc
upon
anyon
or
anyth
at
anytim
he
would
be
imped
upon
someon
free
will
unless
of
cours
you
believ
that
god
did
not
give
u
complet
and
unab
free
will
but
rather
some
sort
of
condit
free
will
someth
that
allow
u
to
make
our
own
choic
and
control
our
own
live
except
when
god
want
to
use
u
to
fulfil
some
good
purpos
of
hi
own
by
harden
our
heart
or
control
u
in
some
other
way
i
hear
alot
of
peopl
who
look
at
variou
event
mostli
catastrophi
or
thing
like
the
aid
epidem
and
make
comment
about
god
will
i
have
a
veri
difficult
time
understand
whi
peopl
believ
that
god
control
anyth
that
happen
on
thi
planet
except
possibl
when
be
ask
to
through
someon
prayer
accord
to
the
bibl
pharoah
wa
go
to
let
mose
peopl
go
after
one
or
two
plagu
but
god
kept
harden
hi
heart
so
mose
could
cast
all
plagu
upon
the
egyptian
the
last
plagu
caus
the
death
of
mani
innoc
child
so
then
god
imped
upon
pharoah
free
will
and
use
him
a
a
puppet
god
did
thi
not
just
to
free
the
hebrew
but
to
free
them
in
some
sort
of
a
grand
fashion
i
suppos
from
the
hebrew
point
of
view
thi
could
be
seen
a
turn
someth
bad
into
good
but
im
sure
the
egyptian
didnt
see
it
thi
way
all
of
your
exampl
of
how
god
turn
someth
bad
into
someth
good
are
base
upon
show
favort
to
one
group
of
peopl
over
anoth
after
all
it
onli
good
base
upon
your
point
of
view
whi
doe
god
who
is
suppos
to
be
the
god
of
all
of
human
