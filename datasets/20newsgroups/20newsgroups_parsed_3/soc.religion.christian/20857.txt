with

just
like
the
jewish
peopl
expect
if
thi
had
happen
year
ago
can
you
imagin
what
whi
do
you
assum
that
jesu
plea
to
hi
father
to
let
thi
cup
pa
from
him
wa
mere
a
plea
to
escap
death
when
i
look
at
jesu
in
the
garden
i
see
a
mangod
who
all
hi
life
had
had
the
presens
of
hi
father
with
him
a
a
result
he
knew
everi
detail
about
hi
death
long
befor
the
agoni
in
the
garden
but
a
that
hour
approach
he
felt
abandon
by
hi
father
hi
presens
diminish
with
each
pass
minut
in
addit
it
wa
brought
more
and
more
to
jesu
attent
the
betray
of
juda
wa
probabl
a
big
impact
that
hi
suffer
would
be
to
no
avail
for
mani
peopl
especi
those
who
would
reject
him
not
onli
then
but
in
the
futur
i
truli
believ
that
the
major
of
jesu
suffer
wa
mental
and
spiritu
while
the
physic
portion
wa
onli
the
tip
of
the
iceburg
btw
we
know
from
john
account
that
jesu
shun
becom
an
earthli
king
from
john
joh
after
the
peopl
saw
the
miracul
sign
that
jesu
did
they
began
to
say
sure
thi
is
the
prophet
who
is
to
come
into
the
world
joh
jesu
know
that
they
intend
to
come
and
make
him
king
by
forc
withdrew
again
to
a
mountain
by
himself
thi
doe
not
seem
like
a
man
who
would
regret
not
becom
an
earthli
king
no
jesu
knew
hi
mission
wa
to
redeem
all
jew
gentil
peopl
and
establish
hi
kingdom
in
the
heart
of
those
who
would
believ
thi
wa
utterli
mistaken
much
to
jesu
dismay
a
an
aspir
to
some
earthli
kingdom
but
he
knew
what
hi
father
will
wa
and
follow
it
obedi
even
in
the
dark
of
hi
passion
