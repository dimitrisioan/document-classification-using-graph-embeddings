do
with

carri
with
u
into
all
these
box
that
we
have

for
ourselv
part
question
would
you
have
becom
a
christian
if
you
had
not
been
indoctrin
by
your
parent
you
probabl
never
learn
about
ani
other
religion
to
make
a
compar
studi
and
therefor
i
claim
you
are
brain
wash
i
wa
rais
agnost
my
father
wa
never
baptis
and
wa
rais
atheist
he
is
not
an
atheist
becaus
he
found
a
closeminded
present
in
the
viewpoint
of
hi
parent
equal
to
the
closeminded
he
found
in
the
viewpoint
of
the
christian
he
came
in
contact
with
thu
i
wa
free
to
choos
how
to
live
my
life
and
he
support
the
decis
i
made
to
join
the
episcop
church
although
he
emphas
to
me
that
hi
respect
for
my
belief
should
result
in
my
not
intrud
on
hi
belief
ie
i
should
not
tri
to
convert
him
a
that
is
hi
decis
pleas
no
flame
or
advic
on
how
to
convert
him
one
of
my
good
friend
is
hindi
and
i
greatli
respect
her
belief
and
the
cultur
surround
her
religion
my
best
friend
is
jewish
and
i
have
alway
held
a
profound
resepct
for
the
jewish
religion
chaim
potok
and
isaac
bashevi
singer
are
two
of
my
favorit
author
i
realli
do
not
think
you
can
make
that
kind
of
gener
about
how
christian
choos
and
i
do
mean
choos
their
faith
if
they
have
not
conscious
accept
the
faith
in
their
adult
life
which
is
what
confirm
repres
then
you
can
talk
about
their
be
brainwash
vera
if
you
choos
not
to
decid
you
still
have
made
a
choic
rush
