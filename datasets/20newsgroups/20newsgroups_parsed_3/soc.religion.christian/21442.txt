re
serbian
genocid
work
of
god
in
articl
d
andrew
byler
write
doe
he
believ
in
predestin
of
cours
i
believ
in
predestin
it
a
veri
biblic
doctrin
a
roman
show
among
other
passag
furthermor
the
church
ha
alway
taught
predestin
from
the
veri
begin
realli
you
may
be
right
but
id
like
proof
a
far
a
i
know
and
i
am
not
a
div
school
student
the
cathol
church
doe
not
seem
to
accept
predestin
my
chaplain
told
me
bewar
of
greek
bear
gift
with
refer
to
thi
doctrin
it
seem
to
have
the
curiou
result
that
human
be
are
not
held
respons
for
their
own
action
ill
answer
how
you
deal
with
thi
in
a
minut
but
to
say
that
i
believ
in
predestin
doe
not
mean
i
do
not
believ
in
free
will
men
freeli
choos
the
cours
of
their
life
which
is
also
affect
by
the
grace
of
god
howev
unlik
the
calvinist
and
jansenist
i
hold
that
grace
is
resist
otherwis
you
end
up
with
the
idioci
of
deni
the
univers
save
will
of
god
timothi
right
that
doesnt
realli
seem
like
predestin
to
me
but
ill
continu
with
what
your
say
for
god
must
give
enough
grace
to
all
to
be
save
but
onli
the
elect
who
he
foreknew
are
predestin
and
receiv
the
grace
of
final
perserver
which
guarante
heaven
thi
doe
not
mean
that
those
without
that
grace
cant
be
save
it
just
mean
that
god
foreknew
their
obstinaci
and
chose
not
to
give
it
to
them
know
they
would
not
need
it
a
they
had
freeli
chosen
hell
thi
is
realli
confus
to
me
especi
sinc
i
still
believ
that
christ
jesu
die
for
all
of
u
preknowledg
of
obstinaci
seem
like
an
aw
convolut
way
to
account
for
a
coupl
of
vers
but
then
i
am
not
realli
biblic
support
in
thi
opinion
or
am
i
other
peopl
who
are
save
are
save
by
the
grace
of
god
and
not
by
their
own
effort
for
it
wa
god
who
dispos
them
to
himself
and
predestin
them
to
becom
saint
but
those
who
perish
in
everlast
fire
perish
becaus
they
harden
their
heart
and
chose
to
perish
thu
they
were
deserv
of
god
punish
a
they
had
reject
their
creator
and
sin
against
the
work
of
the
holi
spirit
so
god
us
grace
like
margarin
he
onli
spread
it
where
it
need
and
not
where
it
isnt
and
so
there
are
the
save
and
the
notsav
and
noth
in
between
hmmmm
ye
it
is
up
to
god
to
judg
but
he
will
onli
mete
out
that
punish
at
the
last
judgement
well
i
would
hold
that
a
god
most
certainli
give
everybodi
some
bless
for
what
good
they
have
done
even
if
it
wa
onli
a
littl
for
those
he
cant
bless
in
the
next
life
he
bless
in
thi
one
although
i
realiz
thi
doctrin
wa
not
origin
intend
to
caus
social
problem
it
end
up
do
just
that
if
there
is
suppos
to
be
some
sort
of
sign
that
someon
is
elect
like
lot
of
child
or
success
at
work
then
those
who
have
a
good
life
on
earth
will
go
around
think
that
those
who
dont
are
doom
to
hell
in
a
way
though
thi
sound
like
the
opposit
idea
those
doom
to
hell
will
have
a
great
life
on
earth
that
almost
like
the
convers
of
what
i
believ
respons
for
what
we
do
now
will
be
punish
after
we
die
your
say
what
we
get
after
we
die
ha
a
direct
bear
on
how
we
live
now
strang
and
those
he
will
not
punish
in
the
next
life
will
be
chastis
in
thi
one
or
in
purgatori
for
their
sin
everi
sin
incur
some
tempor
punish
thu
god
will
punish
it
unless
satisfact
is
made
for
it
cf
samuel
david
sin
of
adulteri
and
murder
were
forgiven
but
he
wa
still
punish
with
the
death
of
hi
child
and
i
need
not
point
out
the
idea
of
punish
becaus
of
god
judgement
is
quit
prevel
in
the
bibl
sodom
and
gommorrah
mose
bar
from
the
holi
land
the
slaughter
of
the
cannanit
annia
and
saphira
jerusalem
in
ad
etc
so
sin
is
either
punish
now
or
later
and
not
both
what
if
it
sort
of
halfpunish
are
there
ani
grey
area
in
thi
doctrin
my
stuff
delet
we
should
stop
the
slaughter
of
the
innoc
cf
proverb
but
doe
that
mean
that
christian
should
support
a
war
in
bosnia
with
the
u
or
even
the
un
involv
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
am
an
isolationist
and
disagre
with
foreign
adventur
in
gener
but
in
the
case
of
bosnia
i
frankli
see
no
excus
for
u
get
militarili
involv
it
would
not
be
a
just
war
bless
after
all
are
the
peacemak
wa
what
our
lord
said
not
the
interventionist
our
action
in
bosnia
must
be
for
peac
and
not
for
a
war
which
is
unrel
to
anyth
to
justifi
it
for
u
the
idea
well
my
idea
would
be
that
you
would
interven
to
establish
peac
and
stop
the
atroc
im
not
suggest
wwiii
i
dont
realli
understand
what
you
mean
by
a
just
war
of
cours
i
am
not
an
isolationist
although
i
see
some
merit
in
not
jump
in
at
the
first
opportun
can
you
say
kuwait
we
happen
to
be
a
big
countri
with
a
lot
of
resourc
a
well
a
a
lot
of
debt
and
thi
give
u
some
respons
in
the
world
whether
we
like
it
or
not
flashback
of
wwii
a
well
a
vietnam
should
be
haunt
u
yet
anoth
differ
of
opinion
so
be
it
andi
byler
thank
you
for
answer
i
hope
you
dont
take
ani
of
my
comment
a
flame
but
instead
a
express
of
interest
vera
i
am
your
clock
i
bind
unto
myself
today
vera
noy
i
am
your
religion
the
strong
name
of
the

own
you
triniti
no
