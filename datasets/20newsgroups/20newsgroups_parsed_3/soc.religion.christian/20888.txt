re
the
arrog
of
christian
if
i
dont
think
my
belief
is
right
and
everyon
el
belief
is
wrong
then
i
dont
have
a
belief
thi
is
simpli
what
belief
mean
unfortunatli
thi
seem
to
be
how
christian
are
taught
to
think
when
it
come
to
their
religion
some
take
it
to
the
extrem
and
say
that
their
religion
is
the
onli
one
and
if
you
dont
accept
their
teach
then
you
wont
be
save
it
take
quit
a
bit
of
arrog
to
claim
to
know
what
god
thinkswant
especi
when
it
base
upon
your
interpret
of
a
book
the
logic
in
the
abov
statement
is
faulti
in
that
it
assum
two
peopl
with
differ
belief
cant
both
be
correct
it
all
about
percept
no
two
peopl
are
exactli
alik
no
two
peopl
perceiv
everyth
in
the
same
way
i
believ
that
there
is
one
truth
call
it
god
truth
a
univers
truth
or
call
it
what
you
will
i
dont
believ
god
present
thi
truth
i
think
it
is
just
there
and
it
up
to
you
to
look
for
and
see
it
through
prayer
medit
inspir
ation
dream
or
whatev
just
becaus
peopl
may
perceiv
thi
truth
differ
it
doesnt
mean
one
is
wrong
and
the
other
is
right
a
an
exampl
take
the
question
is
the
glass
half
empti
or
half
full
you
can
have
two
differ
answer
which
are
contradictori
and
yet
both
are
correct
so
for
your
belief
to
be
true
doe
not
requir
everyon
el
belief
to
be
wrong
if
a
person
ha
what
they
believ
is
convinc
evid
that
god
will
save
onli
christian
it
hard
to
see
how
you
can
critic
them
for
arrog
for
say
so
it
could
be
that
theyr
wrong
but
i
hardli
see
that
it
arrog
let
look
at
thi
a
bit
closer
suppos
we
had
some
combin
of
prophet
and
messiah
that
taught
u
thing
but
didnt
say
anyth
about
exclus
if
we
believ
them
and
then
add
and
anybodi
who
believ
anyth
el
is
damn
then
you
could
well
critic
u
for
arrog
but
in
thi
case
the
exclus
is
in
the
messag
a
it
come
from
the
prophet
etc
so
we
could
be
wrong
in
believ
it
but
i
dont
see
how
we
can
be
call
arrog
mayb
the
world
isnt
a
soft
place
mayb
certain
choic
actual
do
have
etern
consequ
i
can
see
call
the
christian
messag
arrog
in
a
certain
sen
though
onli
in
the
same
sen
a
call
the
law
of
gravit
arrog
becaus
it
doesnt
give
u
ani
option
over
whether
we
fall
if
we
jump
off
a
build
but
not
christian
for
pas
it
on
given
that
they
believ
it
the
complaint
i
can
see
make
are
that
christian
are
wrong
or
that
god
is
arrog
