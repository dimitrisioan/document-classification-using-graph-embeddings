an

the
post
we
get
when
we
have
a

argument
for
allow
christian
homosexu
sinc
most
peopl
ask
the
question
alreadi
know
the
argument
against
it
the
most
common
but
not
the
onli
question
dealt
with
herein
is
how
can
a
christian
justifi
be
a
homosexu
given
what
the
bibl
say
about
it
first
on
the
definit
of
homosexu
mani
group
believ
that
there
is
a
homosexu
orient
ie
a
sexual
attract
to
member
of
the
same
sex
thi
is
distinguish
from
actual
homosexu
sexual
activ
homosexu
who
abstain
from

are
consid
by
most
group
to
be

howev
in
a

the

homosexu
mean
someon
actual
engag
in
homosexu
sex
thi
is
gener
not
accept
outsid
the
most
liber
group
in
thi
paper
im
go
to
use
homosexu
a
mean
a
person
engag
in
sexual
act
with
anoth
of
the
same

i
havent
heard
of
ani
biblic
argument
against
a
person
with
homosexu
orient
who
remain
celeb
i
think
most
peopl
now
admit
that
there
is
a
predisposit
to
be
homosexu
thi
is
often
call
a
homosexu
orient
it
is
not
known
whether
it
is
genet
or
environment
there
is
evid
suggest
each
the
best
evid
ive
seen
is
that
homosexu
is
not
a
singl
phenomenon
but
ha
a
number
of
differ
caus
one
of
them
is
probabl
genet
there
are
sever
group
that
tri
to
help
peopl
move
from
be
homosexu
to
heterosexu
the
bestknown
is
exodu
intern
the

ive
seen
and
i
havent

the
detail
literatur
just
the
summari
in

minor
opinion
to
the

infam
report
on

suggest
that
these
program
have
veri
low
success
rate
and
that
there
are
question
about
how
real
even
the
success
are
but
there
certainli
are
peopl
who
say
they
have
convert
howev
thi
issu
is
not
a
import
a
it
sound
those
who
believ
homosexu
is
wrong
believ
it
is
intrins
wrong
defin
a
such
by
god
the
fact
that
it
hard
to
get
out
of
be
a
homosexu
is
no
more
relev
than
the
fact
that
it
hard
to
escap
from
be
a

if

it
wrong
it

there
no

that

leviticu
becaus
the
law
there
is
part
of
a

that
the

do
not

here
what
he
say
the
two
greek
word
that
appear
in
the
list
ie
i
cor
and
i

are
malako
and
arsenokoitai
unfortun
it
is
not

what
the
word
actual
mean
malako
with
a

of
soft
ha
a
varieti
of

in

write
boswel
suggest
wanton
a
a
like
equival
he
also
report
that
the
unanim
interpret
of
the
church
includ
greekspeak
christian
wa
that
in
thi
passag
it
refer
to
masturb
a

that
ha
vanish
onli
in

a
that
practic
ha
come
to

he
cite
refer
a

a
the

of
the
cathol

that
identifi
it
a

he
translat
arsenokotai
a
male
prostitut
give
evid
that
none
of
the
church
father
understood
the
term
a
refer
to
homosexu
in
gener
a
more
technic
mean
suggest
by
the
earli
latin
translat
would
be
activ
mode
homosexu
male
prostitut
but
in
hi
view
paul
did
not
intend
it
so
technic
for
a
more
conserv
view
i
consult
gordon
fee
commentari
on
i
cor
he
cite
evid
that
malako
often
meant
effemin
howev
boswel
warn
u
that
in
greek
cultur
effemin
is
not
necessarili
synonym
with
homosexu
though
it
may
be
associ
with
some
kind
of
homosexu
behavior
given
what
boswel
and
fee
say
taken
togeth
i
suspect
that
the
term
is
simpli
not
veri
definit
and
that
while
it
appli
to
homosexu
in
some
case
it
isnt
a
gener
term
for
homosexu
while
fee
argu
against
boswel
with
arsenokotai
a
well
he
end
up
suggest
a
translat
that
seem
essenti
the
same
the
big
problem
with
it
is
that
the
word
is
almost
never
use
paul
write
is
the
first
occur
the
fact
that
the
word
is
clearli
compos
of
male
and
fk
unfortun
doesnt
quit
tell
u
the
mean
sinc
it
doesnt
tell
u
whether
the
male
is
the
subject
or
object
of
the
action
exampl
of
compound
word
form
either
way
can
be
given
in
theori
it
could
refer
to
rapist
etc
it
danger
to
base
mean
pure
on
etymolog
or
youll
conclud
that
goodby
is
a
religi
express
becaus
it
base
on
god
by
with
ye
howev
sinc
boswel
fee
and
niv
seem
to
agre
on
homosexu
male
prostitut
that
seem
a
good
a
guess
a
ani
note
that
thi
translat
miss
the
strong
vulgar
of
the
term
howev
someth
which
fee
and
boswel
agre
on
but
do
not
attempt
to
reproduc
in
their
translat
in
my
opinion
the
strongest
nt
refer
to
homosexu
is
roman
boswel
point
out
that
rom
speak
of
homosexu
a
someth
that
happen
to
peopl
who
were
natur
heterosexu
a
a
result
of
their
corrupt
due
to
worship
fals
god
one
could
argu
that
thi
is
simpli
an
exampl
that
if
a
homosexu
worship
fals
god
he
would
also
fall
into
degrad
and
perhap
becom
heterosexu
howev
i
find
thi
argument
somewhat
forc
and
in
fact
our
homosexu
reader
have
not
serious
propos
that
thi
is
what
paul
meant
howev
i
am
not
convinc
that
rom
is
suffici
to
creat
a
law
against
homosexu
for
christian
what
paul
is
describ
in
rom
is
not
homosexu
among
christian
it
homosexu
that
appear
among
idolat
a
one
part
of
a
whole
packag
of
wicked
despit
the
impress
left
by
hi
impass
rhetor
im
sure
paul
doe
not
believ
that
pagan
complet
abandon
heterosexu
sex
given
hi
descript
of
their
situat
i
rather
assum
that
their
heterosexu
sex
would
also
be
debas
and
shameless
so
ye
i
do
believ
that
thi
passag
indic
a
neg
view
of
homosexu
but
in
all
fair
the
shameless
natur
of
their
act
is
a
reflect
of
the
gener
spiritu
state
of
the
peopl
and
not
a
specif
featur
of
homosexu
my
overal
view
of
the
situat
is
the
follow
i
think
we
have
enough
evid
to
be
confid
that
paul
disapprov
of
homosexu
rom
seem
clear
while
i
cor
and
i
tim
are
not
unambigu
and
gener
condemn
of
homosexu
they
do
not
seem
like
word
that
would
come
from
someon
who
approv
of
homosexu
or
even
consid
it
accept
in
some
case
on
the
other
hand
none
of
these
passag
contain
explicit
teach
on
the
subject
rom
is
realli
about
idolatri
it
refer
to
homosexu
in
pass
the
result
of
thi
situat
is
that
peopl
interpret
these
passag
in
light
of
their
gener
approach
to
scriptur
for
those
who
look
to
scriptur
for
law
about
issu
such
a
thi
it
not
surpris
that
they
would
consid
these
passag
to
be
nt
endors
of
the
ot
prohibit
for
those
whose
approach
to
the
bibl
is
more
liber
it
is
not
surpris
that
they
regard
paul
neg
view
of
homosexu
a
someth
that
he
took
from
hi
jewish
upbring
without
ani
seriou
reexamin
in
the
light
of
the
gospel
a
reader
of
thi
group
know
by
now
the
assumpt
behind
these
approach
are
so
radic
differ
that
peopl
tend
to
foam
at
the
mouth
when
they
see
the
oppos
view
describ
there
not
a
lot
i
can
do
a
moder
about
such
a
situat
a
number
of
discuss
in
the
past
center
around
the
sort
of
detail
exegesi
of
text
that
is
describ
abov
howev
in
fact
im
not
convinc
that
defend
of
homosexu
actual
base
their
own
belief
on
such
analysi
the
real
issu
seem
to
rest
on
the
question
of
whether
paul
judgement
should
appli
to
modern
homosexu
one
commonli
made
claim
is
that
paul
had
simpli
never
face
the
kind
of
question
we
are
tri
to
deal
with
he
encount
homosexu
onli
in
context
where
most
peopl
would
probabl
agre
that
it
wa
wrong
he
had
never
face
the
experi
of
christian
who
tri
to
act
straight
and
fail
and
he
had
never
face
christian
who
are
tri
to
defin
a
christian
homosexu
which
fit
with
gener
christian
ideal
of
fidel
and
of
see
sexual
a
a
mirror
of
the
relationship
between
god
and
man
it
is
unfair
to
take
paul
judgement
on
homosexu
among
idolat
and
use
it
to
make
judgement
on
these
question
anoth
is
the
follow
in
paul
time
homosexu
wa
associ
with
a
number
of
thing
that
christian
would
not
find

it
wa
part
of

it
often
occur
between

free
peopl
and

im
not
in
a
posit
to
say
that
it
alway
did
but
there
are
some
reason
to
think
so
the
ancient
distinguish
between
the
activ

passiv
partner
it
wa
consid
disgrac
for
a
free
adult
to
act
a
the
passiv
partner
thi
is
the
reason
that
an
activ
mode
homosexu
prostitut
would
be
consid
disgrac
hi
custom
would
all
be
peopl
who
enjoy
the
passiv
role
thi
support
the
idea
that
it
would
tend
not
to
be
engag
in
between
two
free
adult
male
at
least
not
without
some
degre
of
scandal
clearli
christian
homosexu
would
not
condon
sex
with

slave
or
other
who
are
not

fulli

howev
fee
commentari
on

cite
some
exampl
from
ancient
literatur
of
homosexu
relationship
that
do
seem
to
involv
free
adult
in
a
reason
symmetr
way
thu
the
consider
in
thi
paragraph
shouldnt
be
push
too
far
homosexu
may
have
been
discredit
for
jew
by
some
of
these
associ
but
there
sure
must
be
been
case
that
were
not
prostitut
and
did
not
involv
slave
or
child
some
peopl
have
argu
that
aid
is
a
judgement
against
homosexu
id
like
to
point
out
that
aid
is
transmit
by
promiscu
sex
both
homosexu
and
heterosexu
someon
who
ha
a
homosexu
relationship
that
meet
christian
criterion
for
marriag
is
not
at
risk
for
aid
note
that
there
is
good
reason
from
paul
gener
approach
to
doubt
that
he
would
conced
homosexu
a
a

specif
statement
on
homosexu
i
believ
hi
use
of
the
genesi
stori
would
lead
him
to
regard
heterosexu
marriag
a
what
god
ordain
howev
the
way
paul
deal
with
pastor
question
provid
a
warn
against
be
too
quick
to
deal
with
thi
issu
legal
i
claim
that
the
question
of
how
to
counsel
homosexu
christian
is
not
entir
a
theolog
issu
but
also
a
pastor
one
paul
tendenc
a
we
can
see
in
issu
such
a
eat
meat
and
celebr
holiday
is
to
be
uncompromis
on
principl
but
in
pastor
issu
to
look
veri
care
at
the
good
of
the
peopl
involv
and
to
avoid
insist
on
perfect
when
it
would
be
person
damag
for
exampl
while
paul
clearli
believ
that
it
wa
accept
to
eat
meat
he
want
u
to
avoid
push
peopl
into
do
an
action
about
which
they
had
person
qualm
for
anoth
exampl
paul
obvious
would
have
prefer
to
see
peopl
at
least
in
some
circumst
remain
unmarri
yet
if
they
were
unabl
to
do
so
he
certainli
would
rather
see
them
marri
than
in
a
state
where
they
might
be
tempt
to
fornic
i
believ
one
could
take
a
view
like
thi
even
while
accept
the
view
paul
express
in
rom
one
may
believ
that
homosexu
is
not
what
god
intend
that
it
occur
a
a
result
of
sin
but
still
conclud
that
at
time
we
have
to
live
with
it
note
that
in
the
creation
stori
work
enter
human
life
a
a
result
of
sin
thi
doesnt
mean
that
christian
can
stop
work
when
we
are
save
the
question
is
whether
you
believ
that
homosexu
is
in
itself
sin
or
whether
you
believ
that
it
a
misfortun
that
is
in
a
broad
sens
due
to
human
sin
if
your
will
to
consid
the
latter
approach
then
it
becom
a
pastor
judgement
whether
there
is
more
damag
caus
by
find
a
way
to
live
with
it
or
tri
to
cure
it
the
danger
of
tri
to
cure
it
are
that
the
attempt
most
often
fail
and
when
it
doe
you
end
up
with
damag
rang
from
psycholog
damag
to
suicid
a
well
a
broken
marriag
when
attempt
at
live
a
a
heterosexu
fail
thi
is
go
to
depend
upon
one
assess
of
the
inher
natur
of
homosexu
if
you
believ
it
is
a
veri
seriou
wrong
then
you
may
be
will
to
run
high
risk
of
seriou
damag
to
get
rid
of
it
clearli
we
do
not
gener
suggest
that
peopl
live
with
a
tendenc
to
steal
or
with
drug
addict
even
though
attempt
to
cure
these
condit
are
also
veri
difficult
howev
these
condit
are
intrins
damag
in
a
way
that
is
not
so
obviou
for
homosexu
mani
problem
associ
with
homosexu
are
actual
problem
of
promiscu
not
homosexu
thi
includ
aid
i
take
for
grant
that
the
onli
sort
of
homosexu
relationship
a
christian
would
consid
allow
would
be
equival
to
christian
heterosexu
relationship
in
the
cours
of
discuss
thi
over
the
last
decad
or
so
weve
heard
a
lot
of
person
testimoni
from
fellow
christian
who
are
in
thi
situat
ive
also
seen
summari
of
variou
research
and
the
result
of
variou
effort
for
convers
asid
from
the
presbyterian
report
mention
abov
there
an
faq
that
summar
our
reader
report
on
thi
question
the
evid
is
that
longterm
success
in
chang
orient
is
rare
enough
to
be
on
a
par
with
heal
miracl
the
danger
in
advis
christian
to
depend
upon
such
a
chang
is
clear
when
convers
doesnt
happen
which
is
almost
alway
the
peopl
are
often
left
in
despair
feel
exclud
from
a
church
that
ha
noth
more
to
say
but
a
requir
of
lifelong
celibaci
paul
recogn
though
in
a
differ
context
that
such
a
demand
is
not
practic
for
most
peopl
and
i
think
the
histori
of
cleric
celibaci
ha
strongli
reinforc
that
judgement
the
practic
result
is
that
homosexu
end
up
in
the
gay
sex
club
and
the
rest
of
the
sordid
side
of
homosexu
mayb
homosexu
isnt
god
origin
ideal
but
i
can
well
imagin
paul
prefer
to
see
peopl
in
longterm
commit
christian
relationship
than
promiscu
a
with
work
which
genesi
suggest
wasnt
part
of
god
origin
ideal
either
i
think
such
relationship
can
still
be
a
vehicl
for
peopl
share
god
love
with
each
other
there
an
issu
of
biblic
interpret
underli
thi
discuss
the
issu
is
that
of
cultur
relativ
that
is
when
paul
say
that
someth
is
wrong
should
thi
be
taken
a
an
etern
statement
or
are
thing
wrong
becaus
of
specif
situat
in
the
cultur
of
the
time
conserv
christian
gener
insist
on
take
prohibit
a
absolut
sinc
otherwis
the
bibl
becom
subject
what
is
to
stop
u
from
consid
everyth
in
it
a
rel
when
look
at
thi
issu
it
worth
note
that
no
one
complet
reject
the
concept
of
cultur
relativ
there
are
a
number
of
judgement
in
the
new
testament
that
even
conserv
christian
consid
to
be
rel
the
follow
judgement
are
at
least
a
clear
in
the
bibl
a
anyth
said
on
homosexu
prohibit
against
charg
interest
thi
occur
time
in
the
ot
it
not
in
the
nt
but
i
mention
it
here
becaus
until
rel
recent
the
church
did
consid
it
bind
on
christian
prohibit
against
swear
oath
endors
of
slaveri
a
an
institut
judgement
of
tax
collector
a
sinner
we
do
not
regard
these
item
a
bind
in
most
case
i
believ
the
argument
is
essenti
one
of
cultur
relativ
briefli
prohibit
of
interest
is
appropri
to
a
specif
agrarian
societi
that
the
bibl
wa
tri
to
build
but
not
to
our
market
economi
few
peopl
believ
that
american
judici
oath
have
the
same
characterist
a
the
kind
of
oath
jesu
wa
concern
about
most
peopl
believ
that
paul
wa
simpli
tell
peopl
how
to
live
within
slaveri
but
not
endors
it
a
an
institut
for
peopl
believ
that
the
ir
is
moral
equival
to
roman
tax
farm
the
point
im
tri
to
make
is
that
befor
appli
biblic
prohibit
to
the
th
cent
we
need
to
look
at
whether
the
th
cent
action
are
the
same
when
christian
homosexu
say
that
their
relationship
are
differ
than
the
greek
homosexu
that
paul
would
have
been
familiar
with
thi
is
exactli
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
is
be
made
about
judici
oath
and
tax
collector
until
fairli
recent
christian
prohibit
take
of
interest
and
mani
christian
regard
slaveri
a
divin
endors
inde
slaveri
is
one
of
the
more
common
metaphor
for
the
relationship
between
god
and
human
be
christian
are
often
call
servant
or
slave
of
god
i
am
not
tri
to
say
that
everyth
in
the
bibl
is
cultur
rel
rather
im
tri
to
say
that
some
thing
are
and
therefor
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
becaus
someth
appear
in
the
bibl
that
end
the
discuss
we
need
to
look
at
whether
the
action
were
talk
about
now
ha
the
same
moral
implic
a
the
one
that
the
bibl
wa
talk
about
if
christian
want
to
argu
that
there
are
reason
to
think
that
the
prohibit
against
homosexu
are
still
bind
im
will
to
listen
those
who
claim
that
the
question
doesnt
need
to
be
look
at
are
kid
themselv
unless
they
are
part
of
the
small
minor
who
realli
obey
all
the
rule
list
abov
one
thing
that
worri
me
is
the
great
emot
that
thi
issu
creat
when
you
consid
the
weak
of
the
biblic
evid
some
law
in
leviticu
a
passag
in
rom
whose
subject
matter
is
realli
idolatri
rather
than
homosexu
and
a
coupl
of
list
whose
word
are
ambigu
the
amount
of
concern
thi
is
rais
among
christian
seem
rather
out
of
proport
thi
should
suggest
to
peopl
that
there
are
reason
other
than
simpli
biblic
involv
thi
is
true
on
both
side
clearli
homosexu
christian
are
a
strongli
motiv
to
find
way
of
discredit
the
biblic
argument
a
conserv
christian
are
to
find
biblic
argument
but
i
cant
help
feel
that
the
bibl
is
be
use
by
both
side
a
a
way
of
justifi
attitud
which
come
from
other
sourc
thi
is
a
danger
situat
for
christian
on
the
other
side
of
the
issu
i
would
like
to
note
some
problem
i
have
with
the
prohomosexu
posit
a
it
is
commonli
present
one
of
the
most
common
argument
is
that
homosexu
is
biolog
determin
ie
god
made
me
homosexu
and
i
have
no
choic
i
think
god
made
me
homosexu
is
a
fine
view
for
peopl
who
alreadi
believ
on
other
ground
that
homosexu
is
accept
but
i
dont
see
it
a
an
argument
for
accept
mani
peopl
think
that
alchol
is
larg
biolog
and
drug
addict
may
turn
out
to
be
a
well
that
doesnt
mean
it
ok
most
of
u
have
particular
thing
we
tend
to
do
wrong
some
peopl
get
angri
easili
other
tend
to
be
arrog
other
tend
to
be
attrac
to
woman
who
are
marri
to
someon
els
homosexu
if
we
view
it
a
wrong
wouldnt
be
differ
than
ani
of
these
other
thing
if
we
are
go
to
follow
god
we
all
end
up
at
one
time
or
anoth
have
to
work
to
overcom
bad
habit
and
particular
temptat
that
caus
u
problem
none
of
u
can
sit
back
and
say
that
becaus
god
made
u
the
way
we
are
we
can
just
relax
a
jesu
said
we
all
have
to
take
up
our
cross
daili
thi
concept
of
die
to
self
which
also
appear
throughout
paul
letter
seem
to
suggest
that
there
are
go
to
be
thing
about
ourselv
that
we
we
are
call
on
not
to
accept
paul
letter
and
the
experi
of
christian
throughout
histori
show
u
that
sin
is
ingrain
in
u
and
the
battl
against
it
is
lifelong
and
difficult
the
fact
that
homosexu
is
difficult
to
fight
doesnt
necessarili
say
it
ok
mayb
thi
isnt
the
place
where
we
have
to
die
to
self
but
id
like
to
make
sure
that
those
who
think
it
isnt
are
fight
the
battl
somewher
els
and
not
reject
the
concept
that
all
christian
have
to
fight
against
the
deepli
engrain
habit
of
sin
