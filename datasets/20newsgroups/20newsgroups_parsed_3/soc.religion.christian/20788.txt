the
arrog
of
christian
ive
just
read
carol
respons
and
i
just
had
to
get
into
thi
ive
got
some
vers
which
are
not
subject
to
interpret
becaus
they
say
what
they
say
joe
just
caus
you
say
they
arent
subject
to
interpret
doesnt
necesarili
make
it
so
that
your
interpret
of
these
text
they
are
peter
timothi
and
galatian
peter
but
know
thi
first
of
all
that
no
propheci
of
scriptur
is
a
matter
of
one
own
interpret
for
no
propheci
wa
ever
made
by
an
act
of
human
will
but
men
move
by
the
holi
spirit
spoke
from
god
the
studi
note
in
my
bibl
offer
three
possibl
mean
for
vers
apparantli
it
not
a
clear
to
charl
ryri
a
it
is
to
you
timothi
all
scriptur
is
inspir
by
god
and
profit
for
teach
for
reproof
for
correct
for
train
in
righteous
that
the
man
of
god
may
be
adequ
equip
for
everi
good
work
galat
for
i
would
have
you
know
brother
that
the
gospel
which
wa
preach
by
me
is
not
accord
to
man
for
i
neither
receiv
it
from
man
nor
wa
i
taught
it
but
i
receiev
it
through
a
revel
of
jesu
christ
when
i
read
these
passag
it
wa
not
immedi
clear
to
me
what
everi
phrase
meant
i
had
stop
and
think
about
the
possibl
connot
of
word
what
the
intent
of
the
author
may
have
been
wonder
if
the
translat
use
the
correct
english
word
to
convey
the
same
mean
i
had
to
interpret
if
you
want
to
believ
that
your
are
not
interpret
scriptur
a
you
read
there
probabl
noth
i
can
say
to
chang
your
mind
but
i
think
it
naiv
to
think
that
our
cultur
experi
educ
do
not
affect
everyth
we
read
also
base
on
the
fact
that
jesu
is
the
word
incarn
and
he
judg
peopl
if
they
follow
him
see
act
and
john
and
that
those
who
reject
jesu
teach
are
judg
by
the
veri
word
he
spoke
see
john
then
jesu
word
are
true
and
do
not
need
interpret
nor
would
it
be
just
of
god
to
judg
base
on
hi
word
if
it
had
to
be
interpret
in
colleg
i
took
an
entir
cours
in
biblic
interpret
go
to
ani
christian
bookstor
there
are
score
of
book
on
interpret
and
understand
scriptur
if
interpret
is
unnecessari
there
are
an
aw
lot
of
misguid
christian
out
there
