your

probabl
be

if
we

we

we

that
our

our

you

they
can

thi
argument
of
your
regard
the
certainti
of
an
observ
or
a

is
not

substanti
by
experi
it
remind
me
of
the
theoret
physicist
who
said
that
you
can
never
be
certain
of
a
measur
becaus
the
sensor
interfer

the
field
you
are
tri
to
measur
now
the

physicist
will
repli
that
although
the
measur
can
never
be
made
with
absolut
certainti
he
is
abl
to
determin
the
certainti
with
which
the
measur
can
be
made
and
thi
knowledg
is
often
suffici
to
render
the
measur
use
enough
to
allow
evid
of
the
true
condit
of
the
field
under
observ
therefor
although
our
mind
are
finit
and
suscept

our
compet

give
confid
in
our
abil
