re
atheist
and
hell
imagin
the
worst
depth
of
despair
youv
ever
encount
or
the
worst
physic
pain
youv
ever
experienc
some
peopl
suffer
such
emot
physic
and
mental
anguish
in
their
life
that
their
death
seem
to
be
merci
but
at
least
the
pain
doe
end
in
death
what
if
you
live
a
hundr
such
life
at
the
conclus
of
one
you
were
instantli
reborn
into
anoth
what
if
you
live
a
million
a
billion
year
in
thi
state
what
if
thi
kept
go
forev
did
thi
happen
to
jesu
i
dont
think
so
not
from
what
i
heard
he
live
one
day
of
suffer
and
die
if
the
wage
of
sin
is
the
abov
paragraph
then
jesu
didnt
pay
for
our
sin
did
he
thi
is
someth
ive
alway
found
a
littl
curiou
ive
never
quit
understood
the
triniti
thing
on
the
one
hand
jesu
is
suppos
to
be
god
incarn
but
at
the
same
time
he
is
god
son
for
god
so
love
the
world
that
he
gave
hi
onli
begotten
son
first
question
is
if
jesu
wa
god
in
human
form
how
could
he
realli
be
god
son
if
the
holi
ghost
plant
the
seed
in
mari
so
to
speak
then
it
seem
that
jesu
relationship
to
god
would
be
the
equival
to
the
human
fatherson
relationship
while
a
son
might
inherit
alot
of
the
father
qualiti
he
is
not
the
father
they
are
still
two
separit
entiti
to
tri
and
say
that
a
son
is
the
same
person
a
the
father
is
obvious
wrong
in
that
case
jesu
and
god
arent
the
same
on
the
other
hand
if
their
relationship
isnt
the
same
a
the
human
fatherson
relationship
but
jesu
is
actual
god
incarn
then
he
not
realli
god
son
and
he
never
wa
he
just
god
manifest
himself
a
jesu
at
least
thi
is
how
im
see
it
can
someon
who
is
more
knowledg
about
the
triniti
enlighten
u
get
back
to
the
origin
question
what
is
the
great
price
that
jesu
paid
to
redeem
our
sin
wa
it
die
on
the
cross
sinc
jesu
knew
that
he
would
rise
again
in
day
and
then
ascend
back
to
heaven
i
have
a
hard
time
see
how
thi
is
consid
pay
such
a
great
price
for
human
hi
earthli
bodi
may
have
been
kill
but
then
so
what
he
suffer
a
few
hour
of
physic
pain
but
then
there
ha
been
mani
a
human
who
ha
suffer
a
great
deal
more
the
fact
that
jesu
wa
god
onli
begotten
son
doesnt
seem
to
me
to
have
much
mean
sinc
god
can
beget
a
mani
son
a
he
want
to
jesu
be
the
onli
one
wa
simpli
a
matter
of
choic
i
suspect
that
these
question
will
be
veri
offens
to
mani
christian
on
thi
net
to
those
peopl
pleas
accept
my
sincer
apolog
it
is
not
my
intent
to
offend
or
to
trivial
christ
but
i
do
believ
these
are
legitim
question
and
i
am
genuin
curiou
note
that
the
triniti
and
incarn
have
to
be
look
at
togeth
first
your
read
of
the
virgin
birth
is
an
uncommon
one
in
thi
group
it
danger
to
say
that
no
one
belief
someth
you
seem
to
be
suggest
the
jesu
is
god
son
in
a
physic
sens
with
the
holi
spirit
a
father
and
mari
a
mother
i
consid
that
terribl
heresi
though
some
peopl
react
le
violent
the
virgin
birth
say
that
jesu
birth
is
god
respons
but
it
doesnt
impli
that
god
sperm
wa
involv
inde
one
though
by
no
mean
the
onli
specul
is
that
god
use
joseph
genet
materi
second
jesu
is
in
some
sens
doubli
indirect
from
the
father
in
a
trinitarian
context
the
term
son
refer
to
the
etern
logo
who
is
a
part
of
god
the
son
didnt
come
into
exist
with
jesu
birth
jesu
is
the
incarn
of
the
son
so
hi
son
isnt
specif
a
result
of
be
incarn
rather
it
the
son
who
wa
incarn
