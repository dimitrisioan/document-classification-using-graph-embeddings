the
foundat
for
faith
in
god
is
reason
without
which
the
exist
of
god
could
not
be
proven
that
hi

cf
my
short
treatis

proof
for
the

of

and
summa

now
given
that
god

can
be
proven
by

i
assert
that
hi
command
must
be

although
in
our
fallen
condit
we
must
alway
have
some
measur
of
doubt
about

essenti
be
who
give
order
to

logo
i
next
assert
that
god
is
all
good
if
thi
is
so
then
that
which
is
contrari
to
the
will
of
god
is
evil
ie
the
absenc
of
the

himself
then
by

instruct
that
becaus
a

would
be

now
thi
messiah
claim
that
he

john
if
thi
claim
is

then
we
are
bound
by
