hi
theolog
clash
with
the
theolog
of
the
local
prophet
it
wa
out
of
a
veri
deep
understand
of
the
mosaic
coven
and
an
actut
awar
of
intern
event
that
jeremiah
spoke
hi
prophesi
the
judgement
prophesi
were
deepli
load
with
theolog
mean
in
my
opinion
both
the
portland
earthquak
prophesi
and
the
david
wilkerson
new
york
will
burn
prophesi
are
froth
and
bubbl
compar
to
the
majest
theolog
depth
of
the
jeremiah
prophesi
perhap
one
other
thing
i
should
have
ad
is
that
jeremiah
prophesi
about
the
come
destruct
of
jerusalem
would
have
been
understood
by
the
peopl
of
that
time
to
be
a
full
frontal
assault
on
their
understand
of
their
relationship
with
the
lord
today
the
if
the
gener
populac
hear
prophesi
like
the
portland
earthquak
or
new
york
will
burn
one
they
are
unlik
to
see
it
in
the
context
of
their
relationship
or
lack
of
it
with
the
lord
they
are
far
more
like
to
think
that
they
are
just
the
result
of
the
fever
imagin
of
a
religi
nutter
that
is
one
reason
whi
i
am
alway
deepi
suspici
of
bald
judgement
prophesi
without
ani
explan
of
the
reason
for
the
judgement
thi
doesnt
have
to
be
long
wind
to
see
a
rel
modern
exampl
look
at
abraham
lincoln
second
inaugur
speech
the
relev
section
is
below
it
is
thi
type
of
spiritu
insight
which
wa
miss
in
both
prophesi
post
here
excerpt
from
abraham
lincoln
nd
inaugur
speech
both
read
the
same
bibl
and
pray
to
the
same
god
and
each
invok
hi
aid
against
the
other
it
may
seem
strang
that
ani
men
should
dare
to
ask
a
just
god
assist
in
wring
their
bread
from
the
sweat
of
other
men
face
but
let
u
judg
not
that
we
be
not
judg
the
prayer
of
both
could
not
he
answer
that
of
neither
ha
been
answer
fulli
the
almighti
ha
hi
own
purpos
woe
unto
the
world
becaus
of
offenc
for
it
must
need
be
that
offenc
come
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offenc
cometh
if
we
shall
suppos
that
american
slaveri
is
one
of
those
offenc
which
in
the
provdenc
of
god
must
need
come
but
which
have
continu
through
hi
appoint
time
he
now
will
to
remov
and
that
he
give
to
both
north
and
south
thi
terribl
war
a
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offenc
came
shall
we
discern
therein
an
departur
from
those
divin
attribut
which
the
believ
in
a
live
god
alway
ascrib
to
him
fondli
do
we
hope
fervent
do
we
pray
that
thi
mighti
scourg
of
war
may
speedili
pa

yet
if
god
will
that
it
continu
until
all
the
wealth

shall
be

drawn
with
the
lash
shall
be
paid
by
anoth
drawn
with
the
sword
a
wa
said
three
thousand
year

so
still
it
must
be
said
the
