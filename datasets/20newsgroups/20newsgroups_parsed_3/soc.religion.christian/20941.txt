re
atheist
and
hell
write
hello
i
have
seen
two
common
thread
run
through
post
by
atheist
on
the
newsgroup
and
i
think
that
they
can
be
use
to
explain
each
other
unfortun
i
dont
have
direct
quot
handi
atheist
believ
that
when
they
die
they
die
forev
true
to
a
point
if
you
were
to
ask
a
buddhist
atheist
a
god
who
would
condemn
those
who
fail
to
believ
in
him
to
etern
death
is
unfair
i
dont
see
what
the
problem
is
to
christian
hell
is
by
definit
etern
deathexactli
what
atheist
are
expect
when
they
die
there
no
reason
hell
ha
to
be
especi
awfulto
most
peopl
etern
death
is
bad
enough
actual
ye
and
no
hell
is
etern
death
actual
the
way
ive
had
it
relat
to
me
it
more
of
an
etern
damnat
where
sinner
will
feel
the
lick
flame
of
hell
if
i
supposedli
can
feel
these
flame
i
would
assum
im
still
aliv
but
suffer
and
away
from
god
liter
interpret
of
the
bibl
will
have
a
problem
with
thi
view
sinc
the
bibl
talk
about
the
fire
of
hell
and
such
person
i
dont
think
that
peopl
in
hell
will
be
thrust
into
flame
ani
more
than
i
expect
to
jesu
with
a
doubleedg
sword
issu
from
hi
mouthi
treat
both
these
state
ment
a
metaphor
i
believ
jehovah
wit
have
a
similar
view
where
the
bodi
sleep
for
ever
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
be
condemn
to
hell
either
the
way
i
see
it
if
god
want
to
punish
me
for
be
honest
in
my
skeptic
that
is
for
say
he
doesnt
exist
he
certainli
wouldnt
be
chang
hi
natur
besid
i
would
rather
spend
an
etern
in
hell
than
be
besid
god
in
heaven
know
even
one
man
would
spend
hi
etern
life
