with

i

there
is
no

argument
for
the
inclus
or
exclus
of
the
deuterocanon
book
i
think
everyon
would
agre
that
principl
that
can
not
be
consist
appli
are
not
veri
use
a
principl
so
if
we
are
to
exclud
them
not
accord
them
the
author
of
scriptur
we
would
appear
to
requir
other
reason
what
might
these
reason
be
let
talk
about
principl
if
we
accept
that
god
set
the
standard
for
what
ought
to
be
includ
in
scriptur
then
we
can
ask
is
it
authorit
is
it
prophet
is
it
authent
is
it
dynam
is
it
receiv
collect
read
and
use
on
these
count
the
apocrapha
fall
short
of
the
glori
of
god
to
quot
unger
bibl
dictionari
on
the
apocrapha
they
abound
in
histor
and
geograph
inaccuraci
and
anachron
they
teach
doctrin
which
are
fals
and
foster
practic
which
are
at
varianc
with
sacr
scriptur
they
resort
to
literari
type
and
display
an
artifici
of
subject
matter
and
style
out
of
keep
with
sacr
scriptur
they
lack
the
distinct
element
which
give
genuin
scriptur
their
divin
charact
such
a
prophet
power
and
poetic
and
religi
feel
my
interim
conclus
is
that
protest
exclus
of
at
least
one
of
these
write
is
one
of
those
tradit
of
men
one
hear
of
so
often
they
were
exclud
dure
the
reform
and
that
appear
to
be
the
reason
mani
peopl
continu
to
exclud
them
but
the
problem
with
thi
argument
lie
in
the
assumpt
that
the
hebrew
canon
includ
the
apocrapha
in
the
first
place
and
it
wasnt
until
the
sixteenth
centuri
that
luther
and
co
threw
them
out
the
jewish
council
you
mention
previous
didnt
accept
them
so
the
reform
protest
had
good
histor
preced
for
their
action
jerom
onli
translat
the
apocrapha
under
protest
and
it
wa
liter
over
hi
dead
bodi
that
it
wa
includ
in
the
cathol
canon
the
simpl
fact
is
that
protest
exclus
roman
inclus
orthodox
inclus
of
still
other
book
or
ani
other
definit
of
a
close
canon
is
the
decis
of
a
commun
of
faith
about
what
the
standard
collect
of
scriptur
shall
be
for
that
commun
they
all
are
tradit
of
men
whether
one
consid
that
to
be
a
problem
or
not
depend
on
which
commun
happen
to
be
your
and
how
you
accept
defin
author
within
it
i
person
believ
that
the
concept
of
a
close
canon
whether
cathol
protest
or
orthodox
is
one
that
develop
rather
late
in
the
histori
of
the
church
and
which
ha
not
serv
the

well
how
do
you
then
view
the
word

warn
everyon
who

thi
book
if
anyon
add
anyth

add

him
the

if
anyon
