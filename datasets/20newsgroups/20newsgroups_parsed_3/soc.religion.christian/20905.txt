the
princip
that
marri
each
other
the
church
and
the
state
are
present
mere
a
wit
thi
is
not
just
lewi
it
a
summari
of
standard
cathol
theolog
howev
thi
doesnt
mean
that
the
presenc
of
those
wit
is
option
except
in
odd
situat
like
the
standard
desert
island
clh
i
origin
wrote
to
the
person
who
ask
thi
question
person
but
decid
to
post
the
inform
i
had
on
the
topic
i
spoke
to
the
pastor
of
my
parish
cathol
recent
by
coincid
on
thi
subject
hi
explain
wa
that
while
it
is
possibl
for
a
coupl
to
marri
without
the
presenc
of
a
priest
it
is
import
to
have
it
recogn
by
the
church
a
soon
a
it
is
possibl
becaus
the
church
recogin
itself
a
a
commun
of
believ
member
of
the
church
to
some
degre
are
to
be
held
account
to
each
other
to
be
le
hypothet
than
that
mythic
coupl
on
the
desert
island
there
are
mani
place
in
the
world
that
do
not
have
priest
avail
for
marriag
on
a
regular
basi
therefor
coupl
get
marri
without
the
priest
be
present
but
get
the
priest
to
testifi
to
their
marriag
when
one
come
through
the
area
i
rememb
a
religion
teacher
in
high
school
say
that
the
marriag
ceremoni
is
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
coupl
a
much
a
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
commun
thu
marri
coupl
have
some
respons
to
the
commun
to
stay
marri
a
divorc
set
a
bad
exampl
for
the
commun
also
the
coupl
ha
vow
to
becom
one
with
one
anotherth
commun
should
be
abl
to
reli
on
that
coupl
to
be
a
one
while
coupl
may
marri
without
wit
they
may
not
get
anul
without
a
priest
present
an
anul
is
simpli
an
admiss
of
the
church
that
what
they
had
declar
a
marriag
wa
not
in
fact
a
marriag
at
all
for
whatev
reason
so
dont
start
get
marri
in
the
back
seat
of
a
station
wagon
and
give
yourselv
anul
a
halfhour
later
i
tend
to
agre
with
the
respons
back
there
that
said
coupl
becom
marri
a
soon
a
they
consum
their
marriag
but
i
would
add
that
coupl
should
consid
their
marriag
consum
if
they
have
sex
whether
or
not
they
intend
to
be
marri
assum
they
were
both
will
partner
to
the
sexual
act
the
coupl
must
be
prepar
to
rais
ani
child
they
may
have
a
a
result
of
that
sexual
act
with
the
benefit
of
both
parent
sex
is
a
commit
i
believ
in
god
eye
but
im
digress
god
be
with
you
malcusco
