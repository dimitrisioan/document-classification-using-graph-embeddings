the
arrog
of
christian
melinda
hsu
write
id
like
to
share
my
thought
on
thi
topic
of
arrog
of
christian
and
look
forward
to
ani
respons
in
my
encount
with
christian
i
find
myself
dismay
by
their
belief
that
their
faith
is
total
truth
accord
to
them
their
belief
come
from
the
bibl
and
the
bibl
is
the
word
of
god
and
god
is
truth
thu
they
know
the
truth
thi
stanc
make
it
difficult
to
discu
other
faith
with
them
and
my
own
hesit
about
christian
becaus
they
see
no
other
way
their
way
is
the
truth
but
i
see
their
faith
aris
from
a
will
choic
to
believ
a
particular
way
that
choic
is
part
faith
and
part
reason
but
it
seem
to
me
a
choic
im
sort
of
mystifi
about
how
a
christian
might
respond
to
thi
ill
start
with
a
parabl
a
christian
woman
hire
a
carpent
to
build
her
a
birdhous
when
he
come
over
they
begin
talk
about
religion
so
you
believ
that
you
understand
god
he
ask
ye
i
do
she
repli
then
have
him
build
you
the
birdhous
i
dont
think
that
melinda
is
complain
about
the
basi
of
christian
belief
howev
there
is
a
tendenc
among
christian
to
say
i
have
all
the
answer
becaus
god
gave
them
to
me
thi
is
simpli
not
the
case
i
believ
that
the
bibl
is
inerr
howev
our
human
interpret
of
the
bibl
are
necessarili
in
error
becaus
we
are
human
and
imperfect
we
have
to
rememb
that
we
all
make
mistak
in
faith
and
that
becaus
we
are
human
we
have
an
imperfect
understand
of
the
mind
and
will
of
god
to
claim
a
so
mani
peopl
do
that
the
exist
of
the
bibl
allow
u
to
determin
the
answer
to
all
question
is
to
claim
that
we
human
can
fulli
understand
god
will
thi
is
hubri
