chalcedon
wa
a
compromis
between
two
group
the
alexandrian
and
antiochen
it
adopt
languag
that
wa
intend
to
be
accept
to
moder
in
both
camp
while
rule
out
the
extrem
i
agre
that
there
were
extrem
that
were
heret
howev
in
the
cours
of
the
complex
polit
of
the
time
it
appear
that
some
peopl
got
reject
who
didnt
intend
heresi
but
simpli
use
languag
that
wa
not
understood
or
even
wa
mispres
and
some
seem
not
to
have
joint
in
the
compromis
for
reason
other
than
doctrin
there
are
group
descend
from
both
of
the
supposedli
heret
camp
thi
post
discuss
the
descend
of
the
alexandrian
there
are
also
a
remain
nestorian
like
some
of
the
current
socal
monophysit
there
is
reason
to
believ
that
the
current
socal
nestorian
are
not
heret
either
they
shelter
nestoriu
from
what
they
saw
a
unfair
treatment
but
claim
they
did
not
adopt
hi
heresi
and
in
fact
seem
to
follow
more
moder
repres
of
the
antiochen
tradit
clh
there
is
a
big
differ
between
the
statu
of
what
you
refer
to
a
alexandrian
actual
thi
includ
all
orient
orthodox
church
and
not
onli
copt
and
that
of
nestorian
the
orient
orthodox
church
never
even
shelter
eutych
the
advoc
of
monophysit
but
on
the
contrari
it
condemn
and
still
doe
condemn
him
and
hi
heresi
that
is
whi
the
eastren
chalcedonian
orthodox
church
held
talk
with
the
orient
nonchalcedonian
that
start
year
ago
and
still
continu
till
today
but
they
have
converg
on
mani
issu
the
most
imporat
of
which
is
christolog
i
have
more
detail
of
the
interorthodox
dialogu
in
case
anyon
is
interest
so
i
do
not
see
how
the
alexandrian
and
the
nestorian
are
in
a
similar
