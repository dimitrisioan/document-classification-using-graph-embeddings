post
here
a
an

start
but
rather
to
express
an
opinion
to
my
intend
audienc
the

is
an
anim
who
ha
due
to
hisher
advanc

a
a

hmmm
there
are
other
anim
on
thi
planet
with
advanc
mental
facil
which
have
not
develop
religion
a
a
satisfactori
explain
for
the
unexplain
whi
is
thi
so
further
it
appear
that
onli
human
have
a
need
to
explain
the
unexplain
whi
is
thi
so
the
other
anim
on
thi
planet
includ
those
with
advanc
mental
facil
seem
perfectli
content
in
their
ignor
id
like
to
point
out
that
your
presupposit
scream
out
at
me
from
your
unsupport
statement
they
are
human
are
anim
onli
religion
exist
a
a
crutch
so
that
the
unexplain
need
not
be
research
religion
wa
made
up
by
human
to
address
a
perceiv
need
the
biolog
aspect
of
human
is
deifi
that
is
all
aspect
of
human
life
can
be
categor
in
a
hierarch
structur
with
biolog
at
the
apex
needle
to
say
i
disagre
with
your
strong
opinion
and
the
underli
presupposit
christian
is
an
infecti
cult
the
reason
it
flourish
are
becaus
it
give
peopl
without
hope
or
driven
purpos
in
life
a
safeti
blank
to
hide
behind
oh
wowal
i
have
to
do
is
follow
thi
christian
moral
standard
and
i
get
etern
happi
for
all
of
you
found
jeezu
how
mani
of
you
were
on
the
brink
i
disagre
that
christian
is
an
infecti
cult
it
ha
certainli
shown
itself
to
be
persist
a
a
belief
system
in
spite
of
variou
persecut
throughout
the
past
two
millenia
that
it
continu
to
persever
doe
not
demonstr
that
it
is
infecti
in
a
derrogatori
sen
it
may
be
that
it
provid
a
workabl
system
for
it
adher
and
i
would
argu
that
thi
is
the
case
i
disagre
that
christian
is
a
safeti
blanket
which
supplant
hope
and
purpos
rather
it
point
an
individu
to
the
one
sourc
of
hope
and
purpos
there
is
noth
hidden
about
a
christian
sourc
for
hope
and
purpos
of
what
use
to
you
is
the
distinct
between
intern
motiv
hope
and
purpos
and
extern
given
hope
and
purpos
is
the
appar
loss
of
control
over
one
own
life
the
problem
or
is
it
someth
el
final
one
doe
not
appropri
etern
happi
by
follow
christian
moral
standard
inde
the
sole
reason
for
the
exist
of
christian
is
becaus
standard
are
inadequ
to
save
peopl
from
their
imperfect
moral
standard
are
mere
guid
to
the
christian
the
real
power
to
moral
live
is
given
to
the
christian
in
the
person
of
god
spirit
heaven
is
one
of
two
final
state
that
christian
doctrin
postul
howev
christian
are
gener
not
motiv
to
live
accord
to
christian
moral
standard
by
thi
promis
futur
reward
rather
they
are
motiv
by
the
perceiv
benefit
to
them
in
the
hereandnow
but
i
digress
the
other
reason
christian
flourish
is
it
infecti
natur
a
best
friend
of
mine
breifli
enter
a
christian
group
and
within
month
they
set
ministri
guidelin
for
him
which
basicali
said
thi
prioriti
spread
the
word
mani
christian
organ
are
concern
with
evangel
a
a
prioriti
and
rightli
so
for
it
wa
jesu
himself
who
gave
thi
a
a
prioriti
for
hi
follow
howev
it
is
not
the
penultim
prioriti
a
evangel
is
normal
understood
ie
preach
the
word
convert
at
nearli
ani
cost
repeat
with
new
convert
ad
infinitum
rather
such
evangel
is
gener
best
done
through
respect
the
opinion
of
other
while
demonstr
the
veri
real
benefit
of
a
christian
lifestyl
thi
demonstr
should
be
so
power
that
it
compel
the
nonchristian
to
seek
out
the
christian
to
ask
whi
needle
to
say
such
a
demonstr
is
not
easili
accom
plish
it
take
a
radic
committ
to
the
person
of
jesu
it
doe
not
happen
quickli
so
persever
on
the
part
of
the
christian
is
requir
and
it
can
not
occur
where
no
person
bond
of
friendship
exist
it
is
ineffect
with
stranger
who
can
not
evalu
the
demonstr
over
time
and
it
is
easi
to
alien
or
harm
other
if
the
sole
purpos
of
be
a
friend
is
to
gain
a
convers
a
a
longtim

i
view
with

all
evangel
program
which
incorpor
a
hurryup
attitud
pressur
convers
may
ultim
be
wors
than
no

at
all
becaus
the
pressur

realiz
she
wa
coerc

disavow
christian
when
they
would
have
been
open
to
it
in
the

had
they
not

now
the
bibl

that
it
is
the

i
am
content
to
do
my

do
the

we

we

more

we

that

how

christian

thi

it
piti

how

have
been
lost
in

of
which
christian
ha
had
no

guilti
by
associ
that
christian
which
forc
itself
upon
anoth
is
not
christian
at
all
when
christian
see
a
nonbeliev
they
say
that
person
is
blind
to
the
truth
but
they
can
not
realiz
that
it
is
they
who
live
with
thi
mask
of
fake
each

jesu
wa
just
prophet
who
happen
to
have
a
larg
influenc
becaus
at
that
time
the
roman
were
circa

dispers
the
jewish
popul
and
commun
need
some
sort
of
cohes
element
to
keep
them
strong
in
that
time
of
dire
need
you
appear
to
have
an
amaz
certainti
about
what
realli
happen
year
ago
how
did
you
come
by
it
i
can
not
accept
your
conclus
that
jesu
influenc
wa
a
sole
result
of
the
roman
sack
of
jerusalem
in
ad
he
wa
year
gone
by
thi
time
it
strain
the
bound
of
credul
to
assert
that
noth
about
jesu
life
wa
noteworthi
until
the
sack
i
must
go
these
are
but
a
few
of
my
thought
on
christian
christian
is
have
a
relationship
with
jesu
christ
himself
what
do
you
know
of
him
we
read
