reveal
the
charact
of
god
and
is
holi
just
and
good
a
is
written
in

then
those
who
consid
we
who
are
against
commit
homosexu
act
to
be
biggot
have
to
address
thi
passag
of
scriptur
whi
must
we
onli
discus
scriptur
that
involv
consensu
human
adult
relationship
isnt
that
border
on
sophistri
the
point
we
are
make
is
that
god
did
not
ordain
certain
kind
of
sex
act
not
everyon
who
bring
up
these
scriptur
is
just
tri
to
use
and
emot
argument
that
compar
homosexu
to
beastophil
and
child
molestor
the
issu
we
are
deal
with
is
that
some
sex
act
are
ungodli
i
do
not
have
problem
with
a
love
nonlust
relationship
with
a
member
of
the
same
sex
i
have
them
and
we
all
do
the
issu
at
hand
is
the
sin
have
sex
with
member
of
the
same
sex
or
lust
after
so
other
forbidden
sex
act
are
a
valid
topic
for
convers
and
the
idea
that
these
relationship
may
be
emot
relationship
between
adult
human
is
red
her
we
all
agre
that
it
is
okay
for
adult
to
have
care
