my
problem
with
scienc
is
that
often
it
allow
u
to
assum
we
know
what
is
best
for
ourselv
god
endow
u
with
the
abil
to
produc
life
through
sexual
relat
you
assum
thi
becaus
you
believ
in
a
design
creator
and
you
observ
our
abil
to
procreat
for
exampl
but
he
did
not
make
that
avail
to
everyon
doe
that
mean
that
if
scienc
can
overrid
god
decis
through

that
god
will
for
u
to
have
the
power
to
decid
who

but
then
you
observ
our
abil
to
modifi
fertil
through

experi
and
draw
no
similar
conclus
about

design
u
for
scientif
inquiri
the
use
of
the
technolog
that
it
produc
how
is
it
that
one
abil
is
obvious
from
god
and
the
other
not
i
can
not
draw
a
solid
line
regard
where
i
would
approv
of
scientif
studi
and
where
i
would
not
but
i
will
say
thi
befor
one
experi
with
the
univers
to
find
out
all
it
secret
one
should
ask
whi
they
want
thi
knowledg
i
want
to
know
the
truth
and
hold
the
truth
a
the
most
basic
of
all
ethic
valu
becaus
correct
moral
judgement
reli
on
know
the
truth
not
vice
versa
moral
that
assert
that
assent
to
a
belief
is
a
moral
choic
and
not
compel
by
evid
inevit
cut
off
the
limb
they
sit
upon
falsif
of
evid
consciou
and
unconsci
follow
corrupt
both
the
intellect
and
the
heart
i
will
say
that
each
person
should
pray
for
guidanc
when
tri
to
unravel
the
mysteri
of
the
univers
and
should
ceas
their
unravel
if
they
have
reason
to
believ
their
search
is
displeas
to
god
malcusco
if
there
