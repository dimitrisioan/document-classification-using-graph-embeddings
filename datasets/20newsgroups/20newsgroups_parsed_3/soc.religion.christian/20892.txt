hi
everyon
im
a
commit
christian
that
is
battl
with
a
problem
i
know
that
roman
talk
about
how
we
are
save
by
our
faith
not
our
deed
yet
hebrew
and
jame
say
that
faith
without
deed
is
useless
say
you
fool
do
you
still
think
that
just
believ
is
enough
now
if
someon
is
fulli
believ
but
there
life
is
total
lead
by
themselv
and
not
by
god
accord
to
roman
that
person
is
still
save
by
there
faith
my
ye
and
no
i
do
not
believ
the
abov
scenario
is
not
possibl
either
they
are
believ
and
live
in
at
least
some
part
led
by
god
el
they
are
not
believ
intellectu
but
wait
is
not
enough
especi
import
to
rememb
is
that
no
one
can
judg
whether
you
are
so
commit
nor
can
you
judg
someon
el
i
guess
the
closest
we
can
come
to
know
someon
situat
is
listen
to
their
own
statement
thi
can
be
fallibl
a
is
our
sen
of
communion
one
with
anoth
but
then
there
is
the
bit
which
say
that
god
prefer
someon
who
is
cold
to
him
ie
doesnt
know
him
condemn
so
a
lukewarm
christian
someon
who
know
and
believ
in
god
but
doesn
t
make
ani
attempt
to
live
by
the
bibl
regard
thi
passag
we
need
to
rememb
that
thi
is
a
letter
to
a
church
at
laodicea
peopl
who
are
of
the
bodi
of
christ
rev
he
talk
about
their
work
a
translat
could
say
that
he
say
their
lack
of
concern
make
him
sick
to
the
point
of
throw
up
now
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
you
a
save
through
faith
alon
not
what
you
do
a
taught
in
roman
but
how
can
i
squar
up
in
my
mind
the
teach
of
jame
in
conjunct
with
the
lukewarm
christian
be
spatout
right
save
is
by
faith
alon
except
that
faith
doe
not
come
alon
if
you
catch
the
two
mean
i
can
offer
the
explan
that
jesu
would
that
we
were
either
on
fire
for
him
or
so
cold
we
knew
we
were
not
in
hi
will
and
thu
could
be
made
awar
of
our
separ
thi
is
admonish
for
hi
child
not
etern
damnat
answer
not
a
fool
accord
to
hi
folli
lest
thou
also
be
like
unto
him
answer
a
fool
accord
to
hi
folli
lest
he
be
wise
in
hi
own
conceit
