i
can
see
that
some
of
the
abov
vers
do
not
clearli
address
the
issu
howev
a
coupl
of
them
seem
a
though
they
do
not
requir
incred
pervers
interpret
in
order
to
be
seen
a
condemn
homosexu
do
not
be
deceiv
neither
fornic
nor
idol
nor
adulter
nor
effemin
nor
homosexu
nor
thief
nor
the
covet
nor
drunkard
nor
revil
nor
swindler
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
and
such
were
some
of
you
i
cor
would
someon
care
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
abov
seem
to
say
fornic
will
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
how
doe
thi
appli
to
homosexu
i
understand
fornic
to
be
sex
outsid
of
marriag
is
thi
an
accur
definit
is
there
ani
such
thing
a
samesex
marriag
in
the
bibl
my
understand
ha
alway
been
that
the
new
testament
bless
sexual
intercours
onli
between
a
husband
and
hi
wife
i
am
howev
will
to
listen
to
scriptur
evid
to
the
contrari
remaind
of
my
post
delet
the
moder
then
made
some
comment
i
would
like
to
address
there
some
ambigu
about
the
mean
of
the
word
in
the
passag
you
quot
both
liber
and
conserv
sourc
seem
to
agre
that
homosexu
is
not
the
gener
term
for
homosexu
but
is
like
to
have
a
mean
like
homosexu
prostitut
that
doesnt
meant
that
i
think
all
the
biblic
evid
vanish
but
the
natur
of
the
evid
is
such
that
you
cant
just
quot
one
vers
and
solv
thing
if
you
are
refer
to
the
term
effemin
and
homosexu
in
the
abov
passag
i
agre
that
the
accuraci
of
the
translat
ha
been
challeng
howev
i
wa
simpli
comment
on
the
charg
that
it
is
an
incred
pervers
interpret
to
read
thi
a
a
condemn
of
homosexu
such
a
charg
seem
to
impli
that
no
reason
person
would
ever
conclud
from
the
vers
that
paul
intend
to
condemn
homosexu
howev
i
think
i
can
see
how
a
reason
person
might
veri
well
take
thi
view
of
the
vers
therefor
i
do
not
believ
it
is
incred
pervers
to
read
it
in
thi
way
i
think
your
argument
from
fornic
is
circular
whi
is
homosexu
wrong
becaus
it
fornic
whi
is
it
fornic
becaus
theyr
not
marri
whi
arent
they
marri
becaus
the
church
refus
to
do
a
marriag
ceremoni
whi
doe
the
church
refus
to
do
a
marriag
ceremoni
becaus
homosexu
is
wrong
in
order
to
break
the
circl
there
got
to
be
some
other
reason
to
think
homosexu
is
wrong
clh
actual
i
wasnt
think
of
the
church
at
all
after
all
a
coupl
doesnt
have
to
be
marri
by
a
minist
a
secular
justic
of
the
peac
could
do
the
job
and
the
two
peopl
would
be
marri
my
point
wa
that
it
is
easi
to
find
a
biblic
basi
for
heterosexu
marriag
but
where
in
the
bibl
would
one
get
a
christian
marriag
between
two
peopl
of
the
same
sex
and
if
you
do
see
a
biblic
basi
for
samesex
marriag
how
will
would
gay
christian
be
to
save
themselv
for
such
a
marriag
and
to
never
have
sexual
intercours
with
anyon
outsid
of
that
marriag
relationship
pleas
note
that
i
am
not
tri
to
impli
that
gay
christian
would
not
be
will
to
be
so
monogam
i
am
genuin
interest
in
hear
opinion
on
the
subject
i
have
heard
comment
from
gay
in
the
past
that
lead
me
to
believ
they
regard
promiscu
a
one
of
the
main
point
of
be
homosexu
yet
i
tend
to
doubt
that
gay
who
want
to
be
christian
would
advoc
such
a
posit
so
what
is
the
gay
view
mark
ye
i
agre
that
a
reason
person
might
conclud
that
paul
is
condemn
homosexu
i
wa
respond
to
certain
detail
of
your
post
that
doesnt
mean
i
agre
with
michael
in
all
respect
