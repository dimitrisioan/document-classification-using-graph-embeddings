i
would
have
felt
a
littl
prejudg
i
have
seen
jeff
fenholt
speak
and
i
didnt
find
him
judgement
i
think
that
the
word
for
that
add
wa
certainli
inappropri
but
i
think
they
were
tri
to
say
that
headbang
would
like
the
program
but
i
would
not
put
headbang
in
the
same
class
a
alchol
etc
it
is
condescend
and
i
believ
that
jeff
wa
wear
black
when
i
saw
him
by
the
way
fenholt
play
jesu
in
jesu
christ
superstar
person
im
a
headbang

i
have
a
hard
time
with
what
most
of
the
secular
metal
group

my
opinion
that
