whi
doe
the
univers

i
ask
becaus
of
what
you
also
assum
about
god
name
that
he
just

so
the
question
is
revers
whi
cant
we
assum
the
univers
just
exist
a
you
assum
god
to
just
exist
whi
must
there
be
a
whi
to
the
univers
one
of
the
law
of
natur
specifi
caus
and
effect
seem
to
dictat
at
least
to
thi
layman
mind
there
must
be
a
causal
event
no
reason
altern
exist
a
far
a
i
can
tell
the
veri
law
of
natur
demand
a
whi
that
isnt
true
of
someth
outsid
of
natur
ie
supernatur
it
may
be
that
one
day
man
not
onli
can
creat
life
but
can
also
creat
man
now
i
dont
see
thi
happen
in
my
lifetim
nor
do
i
assert
it
is
probabl
but
the
possibl
is
there
given
scientist
are
work
hard
at
decod
out
genet
code
to
perhap
help
cure
diseas
of
a
genet
variat
again
though
must
there
be
whi
or
a
divin
prupos
to
man
exist
i
believ
the
genet
code
will
be
entir
deciph
in
our
lifetim
but
we
will
not
see
man
convert
entir
inert
materi
into
self
sustain
reproduc
life
ever
ive
never
been
much
of
a
prophet
though
i
cant
even
pictur
new
york
in
my
mind
i
dont
believ
ani
technolog
would
be
abl
to
produc
that
necessari
spark
of
life
despit
have
all
of
the
part
avail
just
my
opinion
when
you
say
that
man
is
onli
an
anim
i
have
to
think
that
you
are
present
an
unprov
statement
a
dogma
if
you
will
and
one
the
requir
a
kind
of
faith
too
by
take
such
a
hard
line
in
your
atheism
you
may
have
stumbl
into
a
religion
of
your
own
a
far
a
we
can
tell
man
fall
into
the
mammal
catagori
now
that
preposit
sort
of
preclud
an
absolut
doesnt
it
without
an
absolut
conclus
what
are
we
left
with
i
believ
the
word
faith
work
nice
if
there
were
someth
more
to
the
man
say
a
soul
then
we
have
yet
to
find
evid
of
such
but
a
it
is
now
man
is
a
mammal
babi
are
born
live
mother
give
milk
were
warmblood
etc
a
other
mammal
are
and
is
similar
in
genet
construct
to
some
of
them
in
particular
primat
for
more
on
thi
check
out
talkorigin
but
befor
you
write
off
all
christian
a
phoni
and
shallow
i
hope
youll
do
a
littl
research
into
it
histori
and
varieti
perhap
by
read
paul
johnson
a
histori
of
christian
from
your
remark
it
seem
that
you
have
been
expo
to
certain
type
of
christian
religion
and
not
other
even
an
atheist
should
have
enough
faith
in
man
to
know
that
a
movement
of
year
ha
to
have
some
depth
and
be
anim
by
some
endur
valu
well
then
buddhism
confucian
taoism
hinduism
judaism
zoeraster
shintoism
and
islam
should
fit
thi
bit
of
logic
quit
nice
all
have
depth
all
have
endur
valu
thu
all
must
be
true
well
then
with
an
equal
scale
and
under
an
equal
standard
investig
them
all
and
discov
where
god
is
or
whether
he
is
for
the
denial
of
god
is
ultim
a
statement
of
faith
nonfalsifi
a
hi
exist
may
be
for
isnt
thi
the
purpos
of
religion
to
discov
and
in
discoveri
to
know
god
you
dont
mind
if
a
few
of
u
