the
terror
of

a
thing
a
sin
or
that
there
such
a
place
a
hell
a
jayn
ha
said
thi
doesnt
mean
we
have
to
come
on
so
strong
so
a
to
hit
peopl
over
the
head
with
a
basebal
bat
yet
the
fact
remain
there
is
a
place
call
hell
a
place
so
fear
that
god
die
to
save
u
from
have
to
experi
it
whatev
you
or
i
a
christian
do
we
should
do
whatev
we
can
to
win
peopl
to
the
lord
if
for
no
other
reason
to
keep
them
from
go
to
outer
dark
jesu
in
mt
tell
u
that
he
didnt
prepar
hell
for
peopl
he
prepar
it
for
the
devil
and
hi
angel
no
where
in
the
bibl
do
i
read
anywher
that
god
predestin
anybodi
to
go
to
hell
dl
moodi
use
to
say
that
the
elect
are
the
whosoev
will
and
the
nonelect
are
the
whosoev
wont
whether
or
not
that
theolog
sound
i
couldnt
defend
but
it
practic
jesu
said
to
the
peopl
of
israel
ye
would
not
now
some
of
you
may
not
be
student
of
the
bibl
heck
some
of
you
may
not
be
christian
have
you
ever
said
to
somebodi
i
dont
believ
in
hell
i
believ
in
the
religion
of
jesu
but
did
you
know
that
jesu
talk
more
about
hell
than
he
did
about
heaven
oh
i
believ
in
the
religion
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
you
find
hell
taught
by
jesu
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
youll
read
that
jesu
talk
about
the
tree
be
cast
into
the
fire
sever
time
he
talk
about
hell
and
about
judgment
in
fact
over
and
over
in
the
synopt
matthew
mark
and
luke
jesu
talk
about
hell
not
isaiah
not
mose
not
john
the
baptist
though
he
did
but
jesu
the
son
of
god
the
great
belov
one
preach
about
hell
becaus
he
love
peopl
and
didnt
want
to
see
them
go
there
now
if
there
is
no
hell
then
jesu
preach
in
vain
it
wa
our
lord
jesu
not
some
angri
baptist
preacher
that
said
where
the
worm
never
dy
and
where
the
fire
never
go
out
jesu
said
that
it
wa
jesu
who
call
hell
a
furnac
of
fire
it
wa
jesu
that
use
the
word
condemn
and
thi
is
the
condemn
that
men
love
dark
rather
than
light
becaus
their
deed
are
evil
jesu
said
that
how
can
we
get
it
across
to
you
that
a
love
die
jesu
preach
about
hell
not
onli
that
but
he
went
through
hell
that
what
calgari
wa
all
about
when
my
lord
wa
on
the
cross
dark
fell
he
call
hell
outer
dark
do
you
have
thi
idea
that
hell
is
a
place
where
the
gambler
are
gambl
over
here
the
drunk
are
get
drunk
over
there
and
the
prostitut
are
prostitut
their
bodi
over
there
that
not
what
hell
is
hell
not
a
parti
there
no
fellowship
there
he
call
it
outer
dark
outer
away
from
god
dark
god
is
light
no
when
he
wa
on
the
cross
he
wa
made
sin
for
you
and
for
me
god
treat
jesu
the
way
sinner
have
to
be
treat
that
is
a
sober
thought
a
my
son
would
say
an
awesom
thought
my
god
my
god
whi
hast
thou
forsaken
me
hell
is
isol
there
no
fellowship
in
hell
there
no
friendship
in
hell
there
no
love
embrac
in
hell
there
no
hand
shake
in
hell
there
no
word
of

i
thirst

go
much
deeper
than
physic
thirst
hell
is
etern
crave
with
no
satisfact
the
man
whose
life
wa
live
for
drug
will
crave
it
etern
the
man
whose
life
wa
live
for
the
lust
of
a
woman
bodi
will
crave
it
etern
and
not
be
satisfi
one
theologian
ha
put
it
thi
way
and
i
think
it
deserv
merit
what
is
hell
hell
is
just
the
kind
of
environ
that
match
the
intern
condit
of
the
lost
in
a
recent
post
i
wa
tri
to
rememb
the
founder
of
the
word
of
life
ministri
ive
rememb
hi
name
jack
wertzen
and
found
that
the
illustr
that
i
gave
wasnt
hi
hi
illustr
wa
that
he
wa
talk
to
hi
barber
and
hi
barber
wife
and
daughter
had
just
recent
been
save
and
he
wa
comment
about
it
to
jack
they
sing
these
song
and
read
bibl
vers
and
their
prais
thi
and
that
i
cant
stand
it
jack
do
you
think
god
would
send
me
to
hell
jack
answer
by
say
ye
i
think
he
would
of
cours
the
barber
said
what
do
you
mean
by
that
well
if
you
cant
stand
live
at
home
with
your
wife
and
daughter
who
sing
hymn
and
prais
to
god
now
what
would
you
do
in
heaven
where
theyll
do
it
for
etern
youd
be
miser
becaus
god
love
you
hed
put
you
where
it
would
match
what
you
realli
are
it
make
a
man
think
the
crucifixion
of
jesu
christ
is
a
fact
that
necessit
the
etern
exist
of
hell
becaus
on
the
cross
he
perform
an
etern
act
dont
ask
me
how
i
dont
know
but
he
is
god
and
he
is
the
infiniteetern
and
when
he
die
he
die
an
infiniteetern
death
it
is
by
that
etern
act
that
he
purchas
etern
life
for
the
whosoev
will
he
suffer
etern
judgment
a
lot
of
peopl
would
like
to
detour
around
hell
by
say
everybodi
is
go
to
be
save
eventu
univers
my
bibl
say
no
hell
separ
them
the
sheep
from
the
goat
after
you
die
there
a
probationari
period
in
which
god
prepar
you
for
heaven
no
my
bibl
say
that
it
is
appoint
unto
men
onc
to
die
and
then
come
judgment
some
of
the
cultist
believ
in
annihil
after
you
die
sssswish
just
like
a
mosquito
your
squish
out
no
in
rev
we
are
told
that
their
is
etern
exist
in
hell
just
a
there
is
in
heaven
i
dont
enjoy
make
these
kind
of
statement
and
mayb
you
dont
enjoy
listen
to
them
but
we
have
to
preach
the
entir
word
of
god
there
is
a
place
call
hell
if
i
could
give
one
vers
of
scriptur
that
could
give
ani
hope
that
peopl
arent
go
there
id
give
it
to
you
but
i
havent
found
it
that
fact
that
there
is
a
place
call
hell
the
fact
that
our
god
is
a
god
of
holi
and
must
judg
sin
the
fact
that
he
ha
made
u
the
kind
of
creatur
we
are
and
therefor
were
respons
the
fact
that
he
ha
place
u
in
a
univers
that
ha
purpos
and
design
behind
it
the
fact
that
sin
is
such
an
aw
thing
and
the
fact
that
god
himself
went
through
hell
to
save
u
from
hell
lead
u
to
two
applic
a
ive
alreadi
mention
if
you
are
a
christian
you
must
worn
other
it
not
good
enough
to
stop
and
fix
their
flat
tire
and
not
tell
them
that
just
around
the
bend
the
bridg
is
out
know
therefor
the
terror
of
lord
we
persuad
men
if
you
havent
accept
jesu
are
your
savior
your
take
an
aw
chanc
a
i
say
to
the
jehovah
wit
who
no
longer
frequent
my
door
if
you
are
right
and
i
am
wrong
then
i
will
have
live
a
good
life
and
will
die
and
ceas
to
exist
but
if
i
am
right
and
you
are
wrong
then
you
will
die
and
suffer
etern
damnat
i
dont
mean
to
make
fun
at
thi
point
but
it
like
dirti
harri
said
youv
got
to
ask
yourself
do
i
feel
lucki
well
do
you
a
man
got
to
know
hi

dont
be
one
of
the
whosoev
wont
becaus
while
i
wa
yet
a
sinner
he
die
for
me
there
no
greater
love
than
thi
that
a
man
lay
down
