re
the
arrog
of
christian
id
like
to
share
my
thought
on
thi
topic
of
arrog
of
christian
and
look
forward
to
ani
respons
in
my
encount
with
christian
i
find
myself
dismay
by
their
belief
that
their
faith
is
total
truth
accord
to
them
their
belief
come
from
the
bibl
and
the
bibl
is
the
word
of
god
and
god
is
truth
thu
they
know
the
truth
thi
stanc
make
it
difficult
to
discu
other
faith
with
them
and
my
own
hesit
about
christian
becaus
they
see
no
other
way
their
way
is
the
truth
but
i
see
their
faith
aris
from
a
will
choic
to
believ
a
particular
way
that
choic
is
part
faith
and
part
reason
but
it
seem
to
me
a
choic
my
discuss
with
some
christian
remind
me
of
schoolyard
discuss
when
i
wa
in
grade
school
a
kid
would
say
all
policeman
are
jerk
id
ask
how
do
you
know
becaus
my
daddi
told
me
so
how
do
you
know
your
daddi
is
right
he
say
he
alway
right
well
the
argument
usual
stop
right
there
in
the
end
arent
we
all
just
kid
grope
for
the
truth
if
so
do
we
have
the
author
to
declar
all
other
belief
besid
our
own
a
fals
thi
is
onli
my
third
time
brows
through
thi
newsgroup
i
apolog
if
im
cover
tire
old
ground
some
of
the
discuss
on
thi
topic
have
piqu
my

im
sort
of
mystifi
about
how
a
christian
might
respond
to
thi
i
can
understand
critic
of
christian
that
say
there
not
enough
evid
to
believ
it
or
that
there
just
a
good
evid
for
other
religion
i
dont
agre
but
clearli
there
are
plenti
of
intellig
peopl
who
dont
find
the
evid
convinc
but
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
your
point
rather
you
seem
upset
that
peopl
who
believ
christian
is
true
also
believ
that
thing
which
contradict
it
are
fals
thi
suggest
a
model
of
spiritu
thing
that
rather
differ
than
the
christian
one
it
sound
more
like
an
existentialist
view
where
peopl
choos
what
valu
to
follow
but
there
no
actual
independ
spiritu
realiti
and
so
no
way
to
say
that
a
specif
choic
is
in
some
uniqu
sens
right
thi
sort
of
model
with
modif
of
one
sort
or
anoth
may
be
appropri
for
some
religion
but
christian
is
in
it
essens
a
histor
religion
that
is
it
base
on
the
concept
that
there
are
actual
spiritu
entiti
out
there
that
one
of
them
ha
interven
in
histori
in
specif
way
and
that
we
see
evid
of
that
in
histori
in
the
mundan
world
we
are
not
free
to
choos
how
thing
work
when
we
drop
someth
it
fall
asid
from
welldefin
situat
where
it
doesnt
the
christian
concept
is
that
spiritu
matter
there
is
also
an
actual
extern
realiti
i
hope
were
all
honest
enough
not
to
claim
that
we
have
perfect
understand
but
while
we
may
not
think
we
know
everyth
we
are
confid
that
we
know
some
thing
and
that
impli
that
we
think
thing
that
contradict
them
are
fals
i
dont
see
how
els
we
could
proceed
thi
neednt
result
in
arrog
im
certainli
interest
in
talk
with
peopl
of
other
religion
they
may
have
thing
to
teach
me
and
even
if
they
dont
i
respect
them
a
fellow
human
be
but
it
got
to
be
possibl
to
respect
peopl
and
also
think
that
on
some
matter
they
are
wrong
mayb
even
disaster
wrong
