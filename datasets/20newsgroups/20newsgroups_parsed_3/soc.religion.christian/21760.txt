nt

of

convict
of
sin
part
ii
let
me
return
to
the
question
stipul
that
paul
meant
hi
use
of
arseonkoitai
to
refer
more
or
le
exactli
to
the
levit
prohibit
of
malemal
sex
in
order
to
bring
out
the
problem
most
clearli
ill
also
stipul
what
i
think
is
far
le
plausibl
that
paul
coin
the
term
for
thi
usag
the
question
i
want
to
turn
to
is
what
that
would
mean
for
paul
reader
and
for
later
christian
thi
should
be
shorter
than
my
last
note
a
we
will
see
that
thi
question
rapidli
confront
u
with
some
of
the
major
divis
within
christ
bodi
and
i
am
not
tri
to
open
the
gate
for
flame
across
ani
of
the
terribl
chasm
that
separ
ani
of
u
from
our
fellow
christian
my
own
bia
loos
characteriz
a
liber
will
be
evid
but
i
am
not
grind
an
axe
here
so
much
a
tri
to
get
all
parti
to
see
that
it
may
be
hard
to
reach
closur
when
the
issu
involv
strike
at
the
heart
of
what
we
each
in
our
own
differ
way
see
a
crucial
to
the
gospel
of
christ
so
stipul
paul
intent
the
immedi
question
is
how
can
hi
reader
understand
thi
intent
and
follow
on
that
question
there
is
a
second
one
what
is
our
proper
action
if
we
do
manag
to
understand
him
sinc
paul
give
not
a
singl
clue
about
hi
mean
in
the
text
of
st
corinthian
there
are
two
posit
answer
and
one
neg
to
thi
question
a
paul
or
apollo
or
someon
in
the
apostol
commun
ha
convey
to
the
corinthian
the
thentradit
jewish
condem
nation
of
homosexu
behavior
and
paul
expect
them
to
be
suffici
welltutor
by
thi
tradit
that
he
need
no
futher
explan
i
should
note
that
there
is
no
evid
in
the
letter
or
in
corinthian
for
such
a
supposit
b
the
spirit
will
teach
u
what
paul
mean
or
if
not
paul
what
god
mean
behind
paul
inspir
wordchoic
c
we
dont
know
and
can
not
guess
to
within
ani
better
pre
cision
here
than
for
comparison
in
the
parallel
use
by
paul
in
the
same
passag
of
the
word
pleonektai
those
who
have
more
if
you

thi

the

that
at

there
is
some
hint
a
to

the

demand

all

strength

ad

it
is
unquestion
that
the
gospel
wa
preach
in

by
the

discipl

their
successor
and
that
our
nt
scriptur
itself
emerg
from
thi
commun
tradit
but
it
also
the
case
that
we
know
littl
or
noth
about
thi
tradit
until
almost
a
centuri
after
paul
which
is
to
say
that
we
have
access
to
the
tradit
onli
after

of

the

ad
b
if
we
are
not
born
of
water
and
spirit
to
revert
to
john
in
an
attempt
to
explain
paul
then
we
have
no
more
hope
of

gospel
than
nicodemu
had
neither
the

nor
the

reason
can
prevent
the
spirit
from
blow
where
it
will
the
paraclet
is
a
kamikaz
but
the
downsid
of
protest
belief
in
the
efficaci

the
spirit
a
our
guid
in
scriptur
is
that
the
wing

that
take

is
also
the
most
fragment
over

note
classic
lutheran
calvinist
and

the
more
bizarr
form
of
i
will
read
scriptur
my
way
are
primarili
a
fring
aspect
of
cultic
protestant
the
main
problem
with
thi
approach
is
that
there
is
appar
no
mean
for
one
person
to
convey
to
anoth
what
that
one
may
feel
is
teach
receiv

which
is
open

is
an

corollari
thi
is
not

possibl
if
i
may
say
a
word
here
out
of
my
own
alreadi
acknowledg
bia
one
complaint
against
critic
methodolog
is
that
it
dissolv
faith
but
sure
a
faith
that
can
not
honestli
face
the
evalu
ation
of
evid
ha
problem
which
mere
theolog
is
helpless
to
address
anyway
there
is
a
seriou
and
unfortun
possibl
of
schism
between
liber
and
conserv
posit
mostli
on
the
basi
of
extrem
zealot
of
posit
b
and
c
a
cathol
sens
of
author
and
tradit
tend
to
constrain
argument
of

to
secondari
posit
so
that
despit
horrend
strain
rome
is
not
a
like
to
find
these
issu
a
ultim
divis
a
the
protest
world
will
and
anglican
will
i
predict
muddl
through
on
the
via

attempt
to
give
each

it
due
but
no
more
than
it
due
second
question
suppos
tradit
tell
u
and
lot
of
spiritu
christian
tell
u
and
critic
thought
at
least
admit
a
possibl
that
paul
is

what
then
again
we
can
abdic
our
person
responsi
biliti
to
tradit
and
let
it
dictat
the
answer
but
it
precis
where
inherit
tradit
are
not
question
that
theyr
most
danger
we
have
exampl
of

question
the
pharise

their
use

in

that

we

of

still
paul
jettison
the
tradit
that
they
were
led
by
the

to
call
into

jesu

peter

paul
do
not
so
much
throw
out

a
coupl

the
weightier

matthew
and
on
these
two
command
love
god

hand
the
whole
law
and
the

also
matthew
if
there
is
a
fundament
becaus
deriv
from

valid
in
the
challeng

a

vastli
beyond
anyth

directli
deduc

deed
it
signifi
to
me
a
certain
failur
of
the
imagin
to
postul
that
onli
the
tradit
that
we
have
specif
challeng
against
are
in
fact
open
to
challeng
all
tradit
pass
through

are
tradit
of
men
that
god
may
lead
u
even
so
that
these
tradit
are
a
sourc
of
our
spiritu
instruct
i
will
freeli
grant
but
tradit
is
inher
human
and
inher
corrupt
and
given
the
fall
corrupt
noth
in
it
is
immun
to
challeng
when
the
spirit
show
u
a
failur
in
justic
merci
and
good

noth
may
ultim
stand
unless
it
doe
follow
from
love
of
god
and
love
of

i
am
perfectli
will
to
grant
that
i
could
be
blind
to
my
own
sin
that
the
spirit
may
have
taught
anoth
what
she
refus
to
teach
me
or
i
am
too
dens
to
learn
that
tradit
might
have
valu
here
but
what
i
know
of
tradit
is
that
on
one
occas
some
superstiti
christian
appeal
to
justinian
after
an
earthquak
in
asia
minor
and
scapego
sodomit
a
the
caus
of
the
earthquak
so
that
legisl
wa
pass
make
homosexu
behavior
a
capit
offens
if
that
is
in
accord
with
the
gospel
of
christ
then
i
am
no
christian
that
is
human
tradit
at
it
most
hate
and
viciou
and
i
see
noth
all
that
much
differ
in
all
the
unbidden
erupt
onto
usenet
of
peopl
who
are
quick
to
condemn
but
slow
to
understand
if
that
is
the
lead
of
the
spirit
then
i
want
no
part
of
it
but
what
i
have
found
in
obedi
to
the
lord
is
that
i
am
myself
total
depend
on
the
wit
of
other
christian
for
the
truth
that
life
in
the
bodi
of
christ
and
i
say
to
all
who
doubt
that
gay
christian
is
from
god
what
gamaliel
said
to
doubt
pharise
who
would
have
suppress
the
earliest
church
be
care
how
you
deal
with
these
peopl
if
thi
enterpris
thi
movement
of
their
is
of
human
origin
it
will
break
up
of
it
own
accord
but
if
it
doe
in
fact
come
from
god
you
will
not
onli
be
unabl
to
destroy
them
but
you
might
find
yourselv
fight
against
god
act
all
i
ask
is
that
you
listen
to
your
tradit
and
read
your
scriptur
with
a
mind
and
soul
open
to
the
spirit
and
to
the
past
histori
of
our
first
christian
wit
willing
to
challeng
tradit
and
other
read
of
scriptur
though
read
with
all
the
author
of
scribe
and
rabbi
and
a
submiss
to
the
declar
that
all
must
depend
on
the
love
of
god
and
neighbor
then
studi
the
evid
learn
the
histori
of
christian
oppress
christian
out
of
their
tradit
and
eager
to
judg
where
jesu
and
paul
tell
u
not
to
judg
and
let
the
wit
of
the
spirit
in
the
life
of
your
fellow
christian
includ
those
who
are
not
of
your
prefer
in
theolog
guid
you
toward
god
truth
michael
l
siemon
i
say
you
are
god
son
of
the
most
high
all
of
you
nevertheless
or
you
shall
die
like
men
and
fall
like
ani
princ
psalm
there
a
certain
ambigu
in
your
discuss
of
posit
a
a
to
whether
your
speak
of
tradit
in
paul
time
or
our
i
think
there
are
two
way
to
use
tradit
one
is
to
say
that
when
paul
and
hi
reader
share
a
tradit
it
make
sens
to
interpret
hi
word
in
the
context
of
that
share
tradit
that
what
make
me
think
that
these
argument
over
word
turn
out
to
be
silli
we
know
that
paul
came
out
of
a
background
that
wa
rather
puritan
on
sex
everyth
els
he
say
on
sex
is
consist
with
that
background
the
tone
of
hi
remark
on
homosexu
in
rom
is
consist
with
that
background
even
if
the
word
in
the
sin
list
arent
the
most
gener
term
for
homosexu
activ
and
it
seem
to
me
that
there
some
evid
that
they
are
not
they
are
just
one
more
piec
of
evid
for
someth
we
would
probabl
be
will
to
believ
with
no
evid
at
all
that
paul
share
the
common
jewish
reject
of
homosexu
but
when
you
identifi
a
with
the
cathol
posit
that
rather
a
hors
of
a
differ
color
the
cathol
posit
involv
a
continu
church
tradit
argument
specif
to
that
tradit
might
be
we
can
get
guidanc
on
how
to
interpret
paul
origin
mean
from
tradit
eg
the
way
the
church
father
interpret
him
and
we
gain
confid
that
hi
prohibit
still
appli
in
our
time
becaus
of
the
univers
judgement
of
the
church
between
hi
time
and
our
i
think
thi
is
a
somewhat
differ
use
of
tradit
a
radic
protest
might
be
will
to
use
known
st
cent
tradit
to
illumin
paul
origin
mean
but
not
use
the
cathol
posit
to
answer
the
question
of
what
our
own
attitud
to
homosexu
should
be
clh
