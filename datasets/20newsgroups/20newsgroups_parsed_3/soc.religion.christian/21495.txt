re
satan
toung
in
articl
allen
koberg
write
there
seem
to
be
mani
point
to
the
speak
in
tongu
thing
which
are
problemat
it
use
a
prayer
languag
seem
especi
troubl
to
me
i
understand
that
when
you
pray
in
tongu
the
spirit
is
do
the
talk
and
when
you
pray
you
pray
to
god
and
the
spirit
is
god
so
the
spirit
is
talk
to
himself
which
is
whi
i
onli
go
by
the
pentecost
use
where
it
an
actual
languag
what
is
wrong
with
the
spirit
talk
to
himself
jesu
interced
for
u
and
roman
tell
of
how
the
spirit
interced
for
u
befor
god
that
is
no
theolog
problem
toung
a
a
prayer
languag
find
support
in
i
corinthian
moreov
the
phrase
though
i
speak
with
the
tongu
of
men
and
angel
use
by
paul
in
i
cor
is
mislead
out
of
context
some
would
then
assum
that
there
is
some
angel
tongu
and
if
when
they
speak
it
is
no
known
languag
then
it
is
an
angel
tongu
it
true
that
thi
could
be
and
ha
been
use
a
a
rug
to
sweep
ani
difficulti
under
but
it
is
a
valid
point
paul
doe
mention
angel
toung
in
the
vers
hmmmin
the
old
testament
stori
about
the
tower
of
babel
we
see
how
god
punish
by
give
u
differ
languag
can
we
assum
then
that
if
angel
have
their
own
languag
at
all
that
they
have
the
same
one
amongst
other
angel
after
all
they
were
not
punish
in
ani
manner
if
the
languag
we
sepak
are
the
result
of
babel
then
it
stand
to
reason
that
angel
would
speak
a
differ
languag
from
u
you
do
have
a
valid
point
about
multipl
angel
languag
but
angel
be
mayb
of
differ
speci
so
to
speak
mayb
differ
speci
commun
differ
troubl
is
while
such
stori
abound
ani
and
all
attempt
at
verif
and
we
are
to
test
the
spirit
either
show
that
the

had
no
real
idea
of
the
circumst
or
that
outright
