re
definit
of
christian
in
articl
clh
write
often
we
get
into
discus
about
who
is
christian
unfortun
there
are
a
number
of
possibl
definit
start
from
the
broadest
commonli
use
definit
are
the
next
level
is
an
attempt
to
give
a
broad
doctrin
definit
which
includ
all
of
the
major
strand
of
christian
but
exclud
group
that
are
felt
to
be
outsid
histor
christian
thi
is
of
cours
a
slipperi
enterpris
sinc
cathol
could
argu
that
protest
are
outsid
histor
christian
etc
but
i
think
the
most
commonli
accept
definit
would
be
base
on
someth
like
the
nicen
creed
and
the
formula
of
chalcedon
are
you
sure
you
want
to
includ
chalcedon
here
i
presum
that
you
mean
the
descript
of
jesu
a
fulli
human
and
fulli
devin
almost
everyon
would
consid
the
major
of
copt
and
armenian
and
the
jacobit
a
christian
yet
for
centuri
it
ha
been
maintain
that
they
disagre
with
the
formula
of
chalcedon
those
that
wouldnt
consid
them
christian
are
most
like
to
object
that
these
commun
dont
requir
a
person
commit
to
jesu
which
is
onli
tangenti
relat
to
the
formula
of
chalcedon
thank
john
kolassa
a
i
understand
the
recent
discus
here
the
copt
for
all
practic
purpos
accept
chalcedon
they
talk
about
one
natur
rather
than
two
but
the
issu
seem
to
be
one
of
terminolog
rather
than
substanc
