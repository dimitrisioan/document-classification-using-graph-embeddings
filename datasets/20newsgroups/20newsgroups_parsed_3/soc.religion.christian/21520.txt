thi
all
obvious
appli
equal
well
to
infant
or
adult
sinc
both
have
soul
infant
must
be
baptiz
therefor
or
they
can
not
enter
into
heaven
they
too
need
thi
form
of
life
in
them
or
they
can
not
enter
into
heaven
are
you
say
that
baptism
ha
noth
to
do
with
ask
jesu
to
come
into
your
heart
and
accept
him
a
your
savior
but
is
just
a
ritual
that
we
must
go
through
to
enabl
u
to
enter
heaven
my
feel
on
baptism
is
thi
parent
baptiz
their
babi
so
that
the
babi
ha
the
sanctifi
grace
of
baptism
and
thu
remov
of
origin
sin
on
it
soul
in
the
event
of
an
unexpect
death
that
is
the
parent
speak
on
behalf
of
the
child
which
is
too
young
to
speak
on
it
own
thi
should
not
surpris
anyon
dont
parent
alway
do
what
they
believ
is
the
best
for
their
babi
whi
would
that
appli
to
the
babi
physic
need
onli
but
not
hisher
spiritu
need
to
have
god
grace
the
purpos
of
confirm
is
for
the
babi
now
young
adult
to
decid
to
reaffirm
for
himselfherself
the
promis
that
hisher
parent
made
at
baptism
that
is
where
accept
jesu
into
your
heart
come
in
in
baptism
the
parent
ask
jesu
to
come
into
their
babi
heart
at
confirm
the
child
repeat
that
request
independ
by
the
way
these
are
my
person
feel
though
i
believ
they
are
pretti
close
to
what
the
doctrin
posit
of
the
cathol
church
on
thi
issu
can
anyon
out
there
back
me
up
or
correct
me
