re
arsenokoitai
nt
mean
of
convict
of
sin
a
metaexeget
or
methodolog
essay
in
articl
write
i
cant
post
it
all
at
onc
so
it
will
come
piec
meal
and
not
daili
i
look
forward
to
read
it
when
i
got
to
the
librari
last
week
it
wa
with
the
object
in
view
to
look
at
some
articl
that
have
appear
over
the
last
few
year
sinc
my
previou
look
at
the
literatur
un
fortun
they
had
move
the
journal
backissu
so
i
didnt
get
a
look
at
the
articl
i
wa
hope
to
find
i
will
continu
to
reserv
my
own
judgment
on
arsenokoitai
until
i
have
seen
the
latest
scholarli
work
and
i
can
hope
that
rexlex
post
may
give
some
meat
to
chew
on
howev
what
i
can
do
now
is
to
point
out
the
methodolog
issu
what
need
to
be
shown
for
anyth
to
be
conclud
in
thi
matter
if
the
articl
rexlex
post
address
these
issu
so
much
the
better
if
not
you
will
perhap
understand
whi
the
problem
is
hard
jame
b
deyoung
write
in
abstractu
thi
studi
argu
that
paul
coin
the
term
arsenokoitai
deriv
it
from
the
lxx
of
lev
cf
and
use
it
for
homosexu
orient
and
behavior
it
is
onli
a
minor
point
but
let
me
make
it
anyway
de
young
ha
alreadi
contradict
hi
own
prior
assert
in
thi
abstract
that
the
ancient
analysi
of
these
issu
wa
concern
with
action
and
not
with
orient
i
doubt
thi
will
have
much
bear
on
the
articl
a
such
but
thought
i
should
point
it
out
from
the
start
the
hypothesi
de
young
is
advanc
is
that
paul
a
coin
the
word
and
b
hi
intend
mean
for
it
wa
in
refer
to
the
levit
law
the
question
i
wish
to
rais
are
how
would
one
go
about
confirm
the
truth
of
thi
hypothesi
and
what
follow
if
one
accept
or
stipul
for
the
sake
of
the
discuss
that
it
is
correct
note
that
b
is
independ
of
a
i
consid
b
far
more
plausibl
than
a
which
seem
mere
to
be
a
counsel
of
despair
over
find
noth
in
the
literatur
contemporari
with
paul
to
clarifi
thi
word
so
far
a
i
know
paul
doe
not
in
gener
invent
word
anywher
els
in
hi
letter
unless
you
have
an
otherwiseestablish
pattern
of
coinag
it
is
not
sound
methodolog
to
assum
it
particularli
if
he
give
no
hint
in
the
immedi
ate
text
to
fix
the
coinag
mean
for
hi
audienc
a
yet
the
extract
present
no
evid
at
all
what
do
we
need
to
confirm
or
reject
the
hypothesi
which
i
should
say
at
the
outset
i
find
somewhat
plausibl
i
certainli
know
of
noth
which
make
it
an
imposs
way
of
constru
thi
problem
passag
im
go
to
set
asid
for
the
moment
the
question
of
whether
paul
might
have
coin
thi
usag
to
look
at
the
more
tractabl
question
of
what
it
mean
for
thi
there
are
in
principl
two
kind
of
evid
that
can
be
adduc
intern
and
extern
that
is
we
can
look
at
the
text
of
paul
letter
for
clarif
or
look
outsid
that
to
prior
or
contemporari
write
that
paul
might
have
reli
on
or
to
deriv
write
that
have
some
claim
of
access
to
paul
mean
the
singl
worst
problem
with
thi
word
in
corinthian
is
that
there
is
no
intern
evid
for
paul
mean
he
us
the
word
total
without
an
explan
or
hint
a
to
hi
mean
save
that
it
inclus
in
a
list
of
neg
impli
that
it
ha
for
him
some
neg
mean
we
are
left
a
the
onli
intern
clue
with
the
etymolog
or
format
of
the
word
which
is
inde
the
reason
that
de
young
and
other
befor
him
have
associ
it
with
the
leviticu
prohibit
of
men
verb
with
other
men
where
verb
is
some
standard
euphem
for
have
sex
lie
in
leviticu
bed
in
greek
one
problem
is
that
bedder
koitai
is
not
a
far
a
i
know
use
that
way
in
greek
therefor
i
offer
one
seriou
test
which
de
young
hypothesi
must
pa
or
be
reject
o
find
a
bodi
of
greek
text
contemporari
with
paul
or
not
much
prior
to
hi
day
such
that
the
xkoitai
format
impli
men
who
have
sex
with
x
obvious
the
best
case
is
to
find
such
usag
of
arsenokoitai
itself
such
text
would
be
confirm
that
the
word
can
be
read
that
way
it
is
worth
emphas
that
compound
word
are
not
in
gener
under
standabl
by
project
what
the
reader
may
imagin
by
the
juxtaposit
of
the
root
exist
of
such
parallel
doesnt
prove
the
hypothesi
correct
but
it
go
a
long
way
toward
make
such
a
usag
whether
or
not
origin
with
paul
in
the
specif
case
of
x
arsen
possibl
of
comprehens
by
hi
reader
my
test
move
in
the
direct
of
extern
evid
if
paul
doe
not
in
hi
text
explain
hi
word
and
he
doe
not
then
he
ha
to
expect
hi
reader
to
alreadi
know
the
word
which
stand
against
it
be
a
coinag
or
to
expect
that
it
mimic
word
format
that
they
do
know
such
that
they
can
guess
hi
mean
without
too
much
flounder
extern
evid
that
is
text
other
than
paul
own
and
lexicograph
or
socialhistor
consider
that
might
be
adduc
then
come
into
the
pictur
if
there
are
other
us
of
the
word
not
depend
on
paul
which
have
suffici
intern
contextu
evid
or
some
gloss
by
a
contemporari
scribe
to
show
a
derogatori
refer
to
male
homosexu
aliti
or
similar
koitai
format
use
in
similar
way
then
one
ha
ground
for
o
deni
that
paul
coin
the
word
and
o
assum
that
hi
reader
might
understand
hi
mean
do
you
see
the
problem
if
paul
coin
the
word
then
he
requir
hi
reader
to
share
enough
context
with
him
to
comprehend
hi
coinag
and
it
intent
in
thi
case
that
they
would
stipul
de
young
guess
understand
him
to
be
refer
to
the
levit
univers
prohibit
of
malemal
sex
thi
mind
you
in
a
context
where
paul
ha
emphas
at
least
to
other
congreg
and
so
one
assum
to
the
corinthian
how
els
to
explain
cor
and
the
corinthian
have
to
be
pull
back
from
overinterpret
their
freedom
the
non
applic
of
torah
law
to
hi
gentil
convert
among
the
consider
that
make
it
implaus
for
paul
to
have
coin
the
word
it
first
element
is
archaic
arsen
is
an
old
attic
or
ionic
form
of
what
in
even
classic
let
alon
koin
time
would
be
assimil
a
arren
to
me
thi
impli
that
we
are
even
more
than
usual
need
of
extern
evid
to
pin
down
mean
and
usag
what
is
paul
do
invent
a
word
in
obsolet
attic
format
and
if
he
didnt
coin
the
word
but
pick
it
up
like
the
other
in
hi
list
a
common
term
of
derog
then
hi
mean
will
be
for
hi
reader
constrain
by
that
common
mean
sinc
he
give
no
other
i
can
not
emphas
enough
that
paul
doe
not
tell
u
what
he
mean
by
thi
word
we
and
hi
origin
reader
are
guess
they
at
least
had
a
contemporari
context
and
mayb
paul
had
use
thi
veri
word
and
explain
it
in
great
detail
to
them
in
person
but
we
have
no
trace
of
evid
of
that
and
to
suppos
it
is
mere
fantasi
so
we
are
desper
in
need
of
extern
evid
about
thi
word
and
it
seem
to
be
except
meagr
that
is
precis
the
problem
i
can
think
of
sever
more
or
le
equal
plausibl
hypothesi
about
the
word
a
it
wa
a
standard
gutter
term
of
abus
for
some
or
all
mayb
veri
specif
mayb
veri
gener
homosexu
male
activ
b
it
wa
a
term
of
abus
use
by
jew
about
the
aw
homosexu
greek
which
may
or
may
not
be
conscious
associ
on
their
part
with
the
leviticu
passag
c
paul
invent
the
term
and
again
there
may
or
may
not
be
an
associ
with
leviticu
in
hi
do
so
he
may
or
may
not
intend
the
word
to
have
an
explicit
and
univers
applic
with
absolut
and
clear
boundari
sinc
none
of
hi
other
word
in
that
list
have
such
charact
thi
last
seem
to
me
about
the
least
plausibl
of
the
hypothesi
im
advanc
of
these
id
say
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
a
is
most
plausibl
but
i
still
have
reserv
about
that
too
if
the
word
never
appear
befor
paul
and
in
later
us
ha
some
evid
of
depend
on
paul
then
one
can
opt
for
paul
coin
it
if
it
doe
appear
befor
him
he
might
still
have
coin
it
be
unawar
of
prior
use
in
which
case
hi
coinag
is
inher
confus
but
one
should
normal
demot
c
on
the
basi
of
ani
earlier
us
especi
if
they
can
be
shown
to
have
been
at
all
common
in
the
place
paul
travel
in
either
of
the
a
or
b
case
one
ha
to
take
into
account
paul
relat
to
the
commun
of
usag
he
pick
the
word
up
from
and
whether
it
be
from
the
greek
or
jewish
commun
paul
relat
are
hardli
straight
forward
there
is
so
far
a
i
have
yet
seen
littl
or
no
extern
evid
to
aid
u
in
select
one
of
these
or
some
other
hypothesi
your
guess
is
a
good
a
mine
or
mayb
wors
or
mayb
better
depend
on
a
lot
of
thing
but
it
remain
so
far
guesswork
and
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
for
one
will
not
equat
human
guesswork
with
the
will
of
god
by
all
mean
be
convinc
in
your
own
conscienc
about
what
paul
is
get
at
a
he
say
elsewher
on
what
wa
in
hi
day
a
major
controversi
of
somewhat
thi
same
charact
roman
hold
on
to
your
own
belief
a
between
yourself
and
god
and
consid
the
man
fortun
who
can
make
hi
decis
without
go
against
hi
conscienc
but
anybodi
who
eat
in
a
state
of
doubt
is
condemn
becaus
he
is
not
in
good
faith
and
everi
act
done
in
bad
faith
is
a
sin
for
my
part
i
can
not
see
ani
way
to
resolv
paul
mean
in
the
use
of
arsenokoitai
without
directli
applic
extern
evid
and
by
the
natur
of
such
extern
evid
it
will
never
reach
to
certainti
of
constrain
paul
own
intent
paul
like
humpti
dumpti
and
me
and
all
the
rest
of
u
will
use
word
in
way
that
are
person
choic
and
sometim
leav
hi
reader
puzzl
if
that
puzzlement
lead
you
to
god
it
may
be
bless
if
it
should
lead
away
a
some
of
paul
word
have
led
some
peopl
then
paul
intens
commun
effort
to
contriv
hi
mean
in
our
soul
may
have
some
regret
consequ
i
have
alway
found
paul
to
be
a
fantast
reliabl
guid
if
i
read
him
in
the
larg
if
i
can
see
him
lay
out
hi
posit
in
detail
and
hammer
it
home
time
and
time
again
i
am
much
le
certain
about
hi
mean
in
hi
mani
brief
and
cryptic
passag
such
a
thi
one
in
my
usual
discurs
way
i
have
gone
on
at
great
length
about
the
first
of
my
intend
metaexeget
point
what
would
be
need
to
confirm
that
paul
a
coin
or
b
in
ani
case
meant
the
word
to
mean
the
same
a
the
leviticu
prohibit
my
second
point
is
to
stipul
thi
hypo
thesi
and
follow
up
what
it
impli
for
both
hi
initi
reader
and
for
later
christian
