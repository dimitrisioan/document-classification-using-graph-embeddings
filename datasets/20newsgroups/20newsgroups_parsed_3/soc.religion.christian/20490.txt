subject
qualiti
of
cathol
liturgi
i
would
like
the
opinion
of
netter
on
a
subject
that
ha
been
bother
my
wife
and
me
late
liturgi
in
particular
cathol
liturgi
in
the
last
few
year
it
seem
that
there
are
more
and
more
ad
hoc
event
dure
mass
it
drive
me
crazi
the
most
gracefil
aspect
of
a
liturg
tradit
is
that
what
happen
is
someth
we
all
do
togeth
becaus
we
all
know
how
to
do
it
led
by
the
priest
of
cours
which
make
it
a
kind
of
dialogu
we
present
to
god
but
the
best
mass
ive
been
to
were
participatori
prayer
late
i
think
the
proport
of
particip
ha
fallen
and
the
proport
of
sit
there
and
watch
or
listen
or
gener
be
told
what
to
do
which
is
necessari
becaus
no
one
know
what
happen
next
is
grow
exampl
last
sunday
palm
sunday
we
went
to
the
local
church
usual
on
palm
sunday
the
congreg
particip
in
read
the
passion
take
the
role
of
the
mob
the
theolog
behind
thi
seem
profoundwhen
we
say
crucifi
him
we
mean
it
we
did
it
and
if
he
came
back
today
wed
do
it
again
it
alway
give
me
chill
but
last
week
we
were
invit
to
sit
dure
the
gospel
passion
and
listen
besid
the
orwellian
invit
i
wa
realli
sadden
to
have
my
and
our
littl
role
taken
away
thi
seem
typic
of
a
shift
of
particip
away
from
the
peopl
and
toward
the
musician
reader
and
so
on
new
thing
are
introduc
in
the
cours
of
the
liturgi
and
sinc
no
one
know
what
happen
the
new
thing
have
to
be
explain
and
pretti
soon
instead
of
do
a
lot
of
the
mass
were
just
sit
there
listen
or
space
out
in
my
case
to
how
the
mass
is
about
to
be
done
in
my
mind
i
lay
the
blame
on
liturgi
committe
made
up
of
lay
expert
but
that
may
not
be
just
i
do
think
that
a
liturgi
committe
ha
a
bia
toward
do
someth
rather
than
nothingthat
just
a
fact
of
bureaucrat
lifeeven
though
a
simpler
liturgi
may
in
fact
make
it
easier
for
peopl
to
be
awar
of
the
lord
presenc
so
weve
been
wonderingar
we
the
oddbal
or
is
the
qualiti
of
the
mass
go
down
i
dont
mean
that
faceti
we
go
to
mass
everi
thursday
or
friday
and
are
remind
of
the
power
of
a
veri
simpl
liturgi
to
make
u
awar
of
god
presenc
but
a
far
a
the
obligatori
sunday
massesmayb
i
should
just
offer
it
up
