re
monophysit
and
mike
walker
hello
src
reader
again
the
misconcept
that
copt
among
other
orient
orthodox
church
believ
in
monophysit
pop
up
again
we
had
a
discus
about
it
a
while
ago
in
articl
d
andrew
byler
write
the
proper
term
for
what
mike
express
is
monophysit
thi
wa
a
heresi
that
wa
condemn
in
the
council
of
chalcedon
in
ad
it
grew
up
in
reaction
to
nestorian
which
held
that
the
son
and
jesu
are
two
differ
peopl
who
happen
to
be
unit
in
the
same
bodi
temporarili
monophysit
is
held
by
the
copt
of
egypt
and
ethipoia
and
by
the
jacobit
of
syria
and
the
armenian
orthodox
then
ofm
comment
these
issu
get
mighti
subtl
when
you
see
peopl
say
differ
thing
it
often
hard
to
tell
whether
they
realli
mean
serious
differ
thing
or
whether
they
are
use
differ
terminolog
i
dont
think
there
ani
question
that
there
is
a
problem
with
nestoriu
and
i
would
agre
that
the
say
christ
had
a
human
form
without
a
real
human
natur
or
will
is
heret
but
id
like
to
be
a
bit
wari
about
the
copt
armenian
etc
recent
discus
suggest
that
their
monophysit
posit
may
not
be
a
far
from
orthodoxi
a
mani
had
thought
with
my
appreci
to
the
moder
i
believ
that
further
elabor
is
need
thi
is
an
excerpt
from
an
articl
featur
in
the
first
issu
of
the
coptnet
newslett
under
the
author
of
the
eastern
roman
empir
of
constantinopl
a
oppos
to
the
western
empir
of
rome
the
patriarch
and
pope
of
alexandria
play
lead
role
in
christian
theolog
they
were
invit
everywher
to
speak
about
the
christian
faith
st
cyril
pope
of
alexandria
wa
the
head
of
the
ecumen
council
which
wa
held
in
ephesu
in
the
year
ad
it
wa
said
that
the
bishop
of
the
church
of
alexandria
did
noth
but
spend
all
their
time
in
meet
thi
lead
role
howev
did
not
fare
well
when
polit
start
to
intermingl
with
church
affair
it
all
start
when
the
emperor
marcianu
interf
with
matter
of
faith
in
the
church
the
respons
of
st
dioscoru
the
pope
of
alexandria
who
wa
later
exil
to
thi
interfer
wa
clear
you
have
noth
to
do
with
the
church
these
polit
motiv
becam
even
more
appar
in
chalcedon
in
when
the
coptic
church
wa
unfairli
accus
of
follow
the
teach
of
eutych
who
believ
in
monophysit
thi
doctrin
maintain
that
the
lord
jesu
christ
ha
onli
one
natur
the
divin
not
two
natur
the
human
a
well
a
the
divin
the
coptic
church
ha
never
believ
in
monophysit
the
way
it
wa
portray
in
the
council
of
chalcedon
in
that
council
monophysit
meant
believ
in
one
natur
copt
believ
that
the
lord
is
perfect
in
hi
divin
and
he
is
perfect
in
hi
human
but
hi
divin
and
hi
human
were
unit
in
one
natur
call
the
natur
of
the
incarn
word
which
wa
reiter
by
st
cyril
of
alexandria
copt
thu
believ
in
two
natur
human
and
divin
that
are
unit
in
one
without
mingl
without
confus
and
without
alter
from
the
declar
of
faith
at
the
end
of
the
coptic
divin
liturgi
these
two
natur
did
not
separ
for
a
moment
or
the
twinkl
of
an
eye
also
from
the
declar
of
faith
at
the
end
of
the
coptic
divin
liturgi
the
coptic
church
wa
misunderstood
in
the
th
centuri
at
the
council
of
chalcedon
perhap
the
council
understood
the
church
correctli
but
they
want
to
exil
the
church
to
isol
it
and
to
abolish
the
egyptian
independ
pope
despit
all
of
thi
the
coptic
church
ha
remain
veri
strict
and
steadfast
in
it
faith
whether
it
wa
a
conspiraci
from
the
western
church
to
exil
the
coptic
church
a
a
punish
for
it
refus
to
be
polit
influenc
or
whether
pope
dioscuru
didnt
quit
go
the
extra
mile
to
make
the
point
that
copt
are
not
monophysit
the
coptic
church
ha
alway
felt
a
mandat
to
reconcil
semant

between
all

thi
is
aptli
express
by
the
current
th
successor
of
st
mark
pope
shenouda
iii
to
the
coptic

faith
is
more

a
i
mention
in
a
brief
apolog
the
comment
quot
abov
from
me
is
confus
i
appear
to
say
that
nestoriu
wa
monophysit
a
andrew
byler
correctli
state
it
the
nestorian
and
monophysit
were
actual
opposit
parti
the
point
i
wa
make
which
nabil
explain
in
some
detail
is
that
some
group
that
have
been
consid
heret
probabl
arent
chalcedon
wa
a
compromis
between
two
group
the
alexandrian
and
antiochen
it
adopt
languag
that
wa
intend
to
be
accept
to
moder
in
both
camp
while
rule
out
the
extrem
i
agre
that
there
were
extrem
that
were
heret
howev
in
the
cours
of
the
complex
polit
of
the
time
it
appear
that
some
peopl
got
reject
who
didnt
intend
heresi
but
simpli
use
languag
that
wa
not
understood
or
even
wa
mispres
and
some
seem
not
to
have
joint
in
the
compromis
for
reason
other
than
doctrin
there
are
group
descend
from
both
of
the
supposedli
heret
camp
thi
post
discus
the
descend
of
the
alexandrian
there
are
also
a
remain
nestorian
like
some
of
the
current
socal
monophysit
there
is
reason
to
believ
that
the
current
socal
nestorian
are
not
heret
either
they
shelter
nestoriu
from
what
they
saw
a
unfair
treatment
but
claim
they
did
not
adopt
hi
heresi
and
in
fact
seem
to
follow
more
