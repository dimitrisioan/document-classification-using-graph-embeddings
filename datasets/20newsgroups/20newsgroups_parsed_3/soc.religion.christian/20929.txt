the
discuss
begin
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
at
all
one
of
the
law
of
natur
specifi
caus
and
effect
seem
to
dictat
at
least
to
thi
layman
mind
there
must
be
a
causal
event
no
reason
altern
exist
i
would
argu
that
causal
is
actual
a
properti
of
spacetim
caus
preced
their
effect
but
if
you
claim
that
there
must
be
an
answer
to
how
did
the
univers
our
spacetim
emerg
from
noth
scienc
ha
some
good
candid
for
an
answer
i
have
alway
wonder
whi
christian
use
the
there
are
question
scienc
or
atheism
can
not
answer
argument
i
hope
thi
is
the
appropri
group
to
ask
thi
question
the
most
popular
question
is
the
question
of
origin
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
or
anyth
for
that
matter
i
think
thi
question
should
actual
be
split
into
two
part
name
whi
is
there
exist
whi
anyth
exist
and
how
did
the
univers
emerg
from
noth
it
is
clear
scienc
ha
noth
to
say
about
the
first
question
howev
is
it
a
meaning
question
after
all
i
would
say
it
isnt
consid
the
follow
a
diehard
skeptic
be
be
it
human
or
whatev
attempt
to
doubt
one
veri
exist
sinc
it
is
so
easi
to
doubt
everyth
els
i
can
not
be
sure
the
world
exist
it
may
be
my
mind
fool
me
can
i
ever
be
sure
i
exist
howev
it
is
onli
possibl
to
exist
or
not
to
exist
someon
insert
an
appropri
shakespear
quot
here
a
be
that
doe
not
exist
can
not
doubt
one
exist
a
be
that
doe
exist
can
doubt
one
exist
but
thi
would
be
pointless
the
be
would
exist
anyway
let
u
return
to
the
origin
question
whi
a
be
that
doe
not
exist
doe
not
need
ani
reason
for
it
nonexist
thi
be
is
not
sure
whether
anyth
els
exist
but
hi
mind
but
let
u
assum
that
the
world
exist
independ
of
the
mind
the
object
postul
the
question
whi
anyth
exist
can
be
counter
by
demand
answer
to
a
question
whi
there
is
noth
in
nothing
or
in
nonexist
actual
both
question
turn
out
to
be
devoid
of
mean
thing
that
exist
do
and
thing
that
dont
exist
dont
exist
tautolog
at
it
best
i
serious
doubt
god
could
have
an
answer
to
thi
question
some
christian
i
have
talk
to
have
said
that
actual
god
is
himself
the
exist
howev
i
see
sever
problem
with
thi
answer
first
it
inevit
lead
to
the
conclus
that
god
is
actual
all
exist
good
and
evil
devil
and
angel
u
and
them
thi
is
pantheism
not
christian
anoth
answer
is
that
god
is
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
sound
much
better
but
i
am
tempt
to
ask
doe
god
himself
exist
then
if
god
is
the
sourc
of
hi
own
exist
it
can
onli
mean
that
he
ha
in
term
of
human
time
alway
exist
but
thi
is
not
the
same
a
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
argument
sound
like
god
doe
not
exist
but
metaexist
and
from
hi
metaexist
perspect
he
creat
exist
i
think
thi
is
actual
a
nonsolut
a
mere
twist
of
word
the
best
answer
i
have
heard
is
that
human
reason
is
incap
of
understand
such
question
be
an
atheist
myself
i
do
not
accept
such
answer
sinc
i
do
not
have
ani
other
method
the
second
question
how
did
the
univers
emerg
from
noth
belong
to
the
domain
of
scienc
and
i
for
one
do
not
doubt
the
question
can
be
answer
by
it
method
mani
cosmologist
have
suggest
that
it
is
entir
possibl
for
univers
to
emerg
from
vacuum
thi
possibl
ha
been
suggest
in
a
recent
hawk
biographi
see
also
lizhi
shuxian
creation
of
the
univers
world
scientif
howev
i
think
the
sci
group
are
more
appropri
for
discuss
like
thi
a
far
a
i
can
tell
the
veri
law
of
natur
demand
a
whi
that
isnt
true
of
someth
outsid
of
natur
ie
supernatur
thi
is
not
true
scienc
is
a
collect
of
model
tell
u
how
not
whi
someth
happen
i
can
not
see
ani
good
reason
whi
the
whi
question
would
be
bound
onli
to
natur
thing
assum
that
the
supernatur
domain
exist
if
supernatur
be
exist
it
is
a
appropri
to
ask
whi
they
do
so
a
it
is
to
ask
whi
we
exist
i
believ
the
genet
code
will
be
entir
deciph
in
our
lifetim
but
we
will
not
see
man
convert
entir
inert
materi
into
self
sustain
reproduc
life
ever
ive
never
been
much
of
a
prophet
though
i
cant
even
pictur

in
my
mind
i
dont
believ
ani
technolog
would
be
abl
to
produc
that
necessari
spark
of
life
despit
have
all
of
the
part

just
my
opinion
thi
opinion
is
also
call
vital
name
that
live

are
somehow
fundament
differ
from
inanim
system
do
christian
in
gener
adopt
thi
posit
what
would
happen
when
scientist
announc
they
have
creat
primit
