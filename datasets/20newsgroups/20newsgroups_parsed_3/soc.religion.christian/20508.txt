but
i
believ
it
got
lost
in
the
weekend
accid
the
moder
describ
thi
is
an
improv
version
anyway
so
no
loss
the
first
time
hl
the
standard
work
on
detect
forgeri
of
ancient
document
is
probabl
the
write
of
friedrich

the

book
if
you
want
to
attempt
read
thi
be
forewarn
nibley
describ
blass
a
a
typic
german
scholar
who
claim
littl
knowledg
of
hi
subject
then
proce
to
exhaust
both
the
subject
and
the
reader
nibley
extract
from
blasss
work
is
in
the
form
of
rule
for
forger
it
make
interest
read
i
confess
that
i
have
not
read
blasss
work
onli
nibley
extract
thereof
my
german
fall
far
short
of
what
would
be
requir
and
a
far
a
i
know
there
is
no
english
translat
avail
howev
i
believ
the
techniqu
he
describ
are
known
wide
enough
that
ani
compet
classic
scholar
could
examin
a
purportedli
ancient
document
and
at
least
determin
if
it
is
consist
with
what
one
would
expect
of
a
genuin
document
of
that
time
frame
we
will
not
be
abl
to
prove
who
wrote
it
but
at
least
we
should
be
abl
to
determin
with
reason
confid
if
it
is
from
that
time
and
cultur
or
is
a
later
forgeri
actual
there
are
type
of
purportedli
ancient
document
alleg
actual
holograph
or
earli
copi
thereof
for
exampl
the
dead
sea
scroll
these
can
be
test
by
variou
scientif
mean
to
determin
the
age
of
the
paper
ink
and
object
found
with
them
thi
can
provid
a
pretti
clear
date
of
the
actual
physic
object
document
claim
to
be
copi
of
ancient
work
although
the
copi
itself
may
be
much
more
recent
for
exampl
we
might
find
a
document
which
monk
in
a
monastari
claim
is
a
copi
of
someth
from
centuri
ago
perhap
even
have
been
through
sever
gener
of
copist
thi
is
more
of
a
problem
but
can
still
be
test
although
the
test
is
not
like
to
be
simpl
we
can
not
expect
a
test
of
the
age
of
the
physic
object
to
tell
u
much
so
we
must
confin
our
test
to
the
text
itself
it
is
import
to
rememb
that
none
of
these
test
can
tell
u
if
the
document
is
realli
what
it
claim
to
be
they
can
onli
date
the
document
and
identifi
it
cultur
of
origin
for
exampl
ive
heard
of
a
letter
suppos
to
have
been
written
by
jesu
himself
to
a
king
in
what
is
now
iraq
if
thi
document
were
to
actual
turn
up
scholar
could
date
the
paper
and
ink
assum
they
have
the
holograph
they
could
check
the
languag
content
and
write
style
to
see
if
they
are
consist
with
what
would
be
expect
of
a
palestinian
jew
of
that
time
howev
even
if
all
test
result
were
posit
there
is
no
way
to
determin
if
jesu
himself
actual
wrote
it
we
would
know
what
time
and
cultur
it
came
from
but
bar
a
known
sampl
of
jesu
handwrit
or
other
clue
for
comparison
scholarship
must
stop
there
there
is
seldom
ani
way
to
determin
who
the
actual
author
wa
a
i
say
im
no
expert
on
blass
work
i
do
rememb
some
of
the
test
which
can
be
appli
to
alleg
copi
of
ancient
work
specif
we
might
ask
is
the
document
intern
consist
doe
it
contradict
itself
if
the
work
it
is
short
it
would
be
rel
easi
to
maintain
intern
consist
even
if
it
is
a
forgeri
the
longer
the
forgeri
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
maintain
consist
for
thi
reason
most
success
forger
stick
to
short
document
is
it
consist
with
the
histori
and
geographi
of
the
time
again
a
short
nonspecif
work
might
not
be
testabl
but
if
the
write
is
of
ani
signific
length
no
latterday
forger
would
be
abl
to
escap
detect
here
we
look
for
the
minor
inconspicu
thing
which
someon
from
that
cultur
would
get
right
without
even
think
about
it
but
which
a
later
forger
would
find
too
numer
and
trivial
to
check
the
devil
is
in
the
detail
what
about
the
literari
style
of
the
work
figur
of
speech
etc
ani
ancient
writer
would
almost
certainli
speak
in
way
that
seem
strang
to
u
are
there
ani
such
odd
phrase
in
thi
book
if
so
do
they
fit
in
with
the
cultur
of
cours
there
are
complic
if
the
document
ha
been
translat
or
possibl
even
if
somebodi
just
updat
languag
when
he
copi
it
a
few
case
of
languag
not
from
the
cultur
claim
may
be
allow
in
recent
copi
they
caus
problem
and
reduc
certainti
to
be
sure
but
dont
necessarili
prove
forgeri
these
test
can
be
quit
effect
given
enough
materi
to
work
with
but
they
are
not
easi
they
requir
the
skill
of
the
historian
the
linguist
the
anthropologist
etc
the
question
to
ask
are
is
everi
aspect
of
thi
document
consist
with
what
we
know
about
the
cultur
of
claim
origin
if
there
are
thing
which
dont
fit
how
signific
are
they
are
problem
area
due
to
our
lack
of
knowledg
later
chang
by
copist
or
are
they
realli
signific
there
will
often
be
some
ambigu

we
never
know
everyth
about

the
end
result
of
ani
such
test
is
occasion
certain
particularli
in

howev
often
it
may
