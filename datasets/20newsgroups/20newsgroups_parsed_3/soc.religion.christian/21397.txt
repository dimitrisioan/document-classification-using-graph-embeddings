re
question
from
an
agnost
hi
damon
no
matter
what
system
or
explan
of
creation
you
wish
to
accept
you
alway
have
to
start
with
one
of
two
premis
creation
from
noth
or
creation
from
someth
there
are
no
other
altern
and
if
we
accept
one
or
the
other
of
those
two
premis
then
again
there
are
two
altern
either
creation
wa
random
or
wa
accord
to
some
plan
if
it
wa
random
i
am
unabl
to
accept
that
the
complex
natur
of
our
world
with
interrel
interdepend
organ
and
creatur
could
exist
a
they
do
therefor
i
am
left
with
creation
under
the
control
of
an
intellig
capabl
of
devis
such
a
scheme
i
call
that
intellig
god
i
also
prefer
the
creatio
ex
nihilo
rather
than
from
chao
a
it
is
cleaner
there
is
obvious
no
way
to
prove
either
or
neither
we
are
and
we
must
have
come
from
somewher
choos
whatev
explan
you
feel
most
comfort
with

are
the
one
who
ha
to
live
with
your
choic
