subject
christian
and
repeat
life
there
is
a
paragraph
in
the
new
testament
which
in
my
opinion
clearli
make
a
posit
infer
to
reincarn
i
dont
rememb
which
one
it
is
off
of
the
top
of
my
head
but
it
basic
go
like
thi
jesu
is
talk
with
the
apostl
and
they
ask
him
whi
the
pharise
say
that
befor
the
messiah
can
come
elijah
must
first
come
jesu
repli
that
elijah
ha
come
but
they
did
not
recogn
him
it
then
say
that
the
apostl
perceiv
that
he
wa
refer
to
john
the
baptist
thi
seem
to
me
to
clearli
impli
reincarn
thi
wa
a
popular
belief
in
the
judaism
of
jesu
time
that
elijah
would
return
again
a
he
had
been
taken
in
to
heaven
in
a
chariot
and
did
not
actual
die
howev
jesu
wa
refer
to
john
the
baptist
not
in
the
sens
that
elijah
wa
reincarn
a
john
rememb
elijah
didnt
die
but
that
john
wa
a
similar
prophet
to
elijah
john
wa
a
fieri
preacher
he
wore
sackcloth
and
wander
rough
through
israel
preach
the
come
kingdom
the
vers
that
describ
him
in
mark
gospel
can
be
link
to
ot
refer
about
elijah
henc
john
wa
similar
to
elijah
and
jesu
wa
draw
the
parallel
between
the
two
just
a
he
drew
parallel
with
the
suffer
servant
in
isaiah
and
other
messian
figur
and
himself
