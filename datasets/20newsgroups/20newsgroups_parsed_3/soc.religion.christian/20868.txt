my
colleg
on
revel
we
have
been
do
pretti
good
a
far
a
get
some
sort
of
reason
interpret
we
are
now
on
chapter
and
which
talk
about
the
woman
on
the
beast
and
the
fall
of
babylon
i
believ
the
beast
is
the
antichrist
some
may
differ
but
it
seem
obviou
and
the
woman
repres
babylon
which
stand
for
rome
or
the
roman
cathol
church
what
are
some
view
on
thi
interpret
is
the
fall
babylon
in
chapter
the
same
babylon
in
a
in
chapter
the
cathol
church
hate
to
step
on
toe
thank
an
interest
interpret
of
revel
and
ha
been
given
by
evangelist
david
wilkerson
i
am
not
say
that
i
total
agre
with
hi
interpret
but
it
is
certainli
believ
and
good
food
for
thought
he
interpret
the
babylon
of
revel
a
be
none
other
than
the
good
old
u
s
of
a
that
right
america
he
support
hi
claim
in
sever
way
the
babylon
of
revel
is
the
world
leader
in
trade
and
commerc
and
the
whole
world
wept
when
babylon
fell
the
american
dollar
despit
the
japanes
success
of
the
th
centuri
is
still
the
most
sought
after
currenc
in
the
world
if
the
u
were
destroy
wouldnt
the
whole
world
mourn
the
bibl
also
talk
about
babylon
be
a
home
of
harlot
sin
and
adulteri
i
am
paraphras
of
cours
babylon
sin
affect
or
should
i
say
infect
the
whole
world
it
doesnt
take
much
look
to
see
that
the
u
is
in
a
state
of
moral
decay
hasnt
the
american
cultur
and
hollywood
spread
the
do
it
if
it
feel
good
mental
all
over
the
world
i
think
though
that
what
mr
wilkerson
use
a
hi
strongest
argument
is
the
fact
that
revel
call
babylon
babylon
the
great
and
portray
it
a
the
most
power
nation
on
earth
no
matter
how
dissatisfi
you
are
with
the
state
of
our
countri
i
dont
think
you
would
have
too
much
troubl
agre
that
the
u
is
still
the
most
power
nation
on
earth
again
thi
interpret
is
not
necessarili
my
own
but
i
do
find
it
worthi
of
consider
