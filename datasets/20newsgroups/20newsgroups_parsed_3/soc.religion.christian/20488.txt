christ
is
the
onli
one
who
is
abl
to
bear
our

for
there
is
none

wherebi
we
must
be
save
act
jesu
said
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
no
man
cometh
unto

but
by
me
john
if
we
confess
our
sin
he
is
faith
and
just
to
forgiv
u
our
sin
and
to
clean
u
from
all
unright
john
q
now
i
am
desper
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
hell
what
can
i
do
a
you
must
rememb
that
god
is
the
onli
one
who
can
help
you
you
must
throw
yourself
altogeth
on
the
merci
of
god
a
you
see
your
hopeless
condit
a
a
sinner
cri
out
to
god
to
save
you
and
the
publican
stand
afar
off
would
not
lift
up
so
much
a
hi
eye
unto
heaven
but
smote
upon
hi
breast
say
god
be
merci
to
me
a
sinner
luke
sir
what
must
i
do
to
be
save
and
they
said
believ
on
the
lord
jesu
christ
and
thou
shalt
be
save
act
q
but
how
can
i
believ
on
christ
if
i
know
so
littl
about
him
a
wonder
god
not
onli
save
u
through
the
lord
jesu
but
he
also
give
u
the
faith
to
believ
on
him
you
can
pray
to
god
that
he
will
give
you
faith
in
jesu
christ
a
your
savior
for
by
grace
are
ye
save
through
faith
and
that
not
of
yourselv
it
is
the
gift
of
god
ephesian
god
work
particularli
through
the
bibl
to
give
u
that
faith
so
if
you
realli
mean
busi
with
god
about
your
salvat
you
should
use
everi
opportun
to
hear
and
studi
the
bibl
which
is
the
onli
word
of

in
thi
brochur
all
vers
from
the
bibl
are
within
indent
paragraph
give
heed
to
them
with
all
your
heart
so
then
faith
cometh
by
hear
and
hear
by
the
word
of
god
roman
q
but
doe
thi
mean
that
i
have
to
surrend
everyth
to

a
ye
god
want
u
to
come
to
him
in
total
humil
acknowledg
our

total
in

the
sacrific

god
are
a
broken
spirit
a
broken
and
a
contrit
heart
o
god
thou
wilt
not
despis
psalm
becaus
we
are
sinner
we
love
our

therefor
we
must
begin
to
pray
to
god
for
an
intens
hatr
of
our
sin
and
if
we
sincer
desir
salvat
we
will
also
begin
