i
can
onli
repli
with
what
it
say
in
timothi
im
not
here
to
discount
part
of
the
bibl
rather
im
here
onli
to
discount
the
notion
of
revel
the
author
of
timothi
told
what
he
thought
wa
the
truth
base
on
hi
belief
in
god
hi
faith
in
jesu
a
the
resurrect
son
and
hi
read
of
the
old
testament
but
again
what
had
been
reveal
to
him
wa
base
on
at
best
secondhand
inform
given
by
friend
and
author
who
may
not
have
given
the
whole
truth
or
who
may
have
exagger
a
bit
first
of
all
the
origin
poster
misquot
the
refer
is
from
tim
the
author
wa
paul
and
hi
revel
were
anyth
but
at
best
secondhand
and
is
came
about
that
a
saul
journey
he
wa
approach
damascu
and
suddenli
a
light
from
heaven
flash
around
him
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
heard
a
voic
say
to
him
saul
saul
whi
are
you
persecut
me
and
he
said
who
art
thou
lord
and
he
said
i
am
jesu
whom
you
are
persecut
act
na
paul
receiv
revel
directli
from
the
risen
jesu
pretti
cool
eh
he
becam
close
involv
with
the
earli
church
the
leader
of
which
were
follow
of
jesu
throughout
hi
ministri
on
earth
now
you
may
say
the
holi
spirit
reveal
these
thing
unto
him
and
we
could
go
into
that
argument
but
youd
be
hardpress
to
convinc
me
that
the
holi
spirit
exist
i
agre
i
dont
believ
anyon
but
the
spirit
would
be
abl
to
convinc
you
the
spirit
exist
plea
dont
complain
about
thi
be
circular
i
know
it
is
but
realli
can
anyth
of
the
natur
world
explain
the
supernatur
thi
is
whi
revel
is
necessari
to
the
author
of
the
bibl
addit
what
he
ha
written
is
again
secondhand
info
if
it
were
given
by
the
spirit
and
still
carri
the
chanc
it
is
not
true
the
spirit
is
part
of
god
how
much
closer
to
the
sourc
can
you
get
the
greek
in
timothi
which
is
sometim
translat
a
inspir
by
god
liter
mean
godbreath
in
other
word
god
spoke
the
actual
word
into
the
scriptur
mani
theologian
and
bibl
scholar
dr
jame
boic
is
one
that
i
can
rememb
offhand
get
quit
annoy
by
the
dryness
and
incomplet
of
inspir
by
god
the
onli
way
you
would
be
abl
to
escap
thi
notion
of
secondhand
info
is
to
have
had
the
entir
bibl
written
by
god
himself
and
to
tell
the
truth
ive
studi
the
bibl
extens
and
have
yet
to
hear
of
scholar
who
have
put
forth
object
evid
show
god
a
the
first
author
of
thi
collect
of
book
that
what
the
vers
taken
from
timothi
wa
all
about
the
continu
of
a
book
written
over
a
span
of
year
by
more
than
author
from
all
walk
of
life
is
a
testimoni
to
the
singl
authorship
of
god
and
a
for
reason
read
what
it
say
in
corinthian
about
human
wisdom
basic
it
say
that
human
wisdom
is
useless
when
compar
with
what
god
ha
written
for
our
learn
if
you
knew
of
jesu
a
well
a
you
know
the
bibl
youd
realiz
he
reason
out
the
law
and
the
prophet
for
the
common
man
what
sourc
to
you
claim
to
have
discov
which
ha
inform
of
superior
histor
to
the
bibl
certainli
not
josephu
write
or
the
write
of
the
gnostic
which
were
third
centuri
at
the
earliest
and
though
some
claim
jesu
wa
he
wa
human
with
all
of
the
human
wisdom
the
apostl
paul
set
out
to
critic
yet
would
you
not
embrac
the
idea
that
jesu
wa
wise
jesu
wa
fulli
god
a
well
that
whi
id
assert
that
he
is
wise
i
realis
that
you
may
not
accept
the
author
of
the
bibl
thi
is
unfortun
to
say
the
least
becaus
there
is
no
other
way
of
learn
about
god
and
christ
and
god
purpos
with
the
earth
than
read
the
bibl
and
search
out
it
truth
for
yourself
for
your
inform
i
wa
rais
without
ani
knowledg
of
god
by
the
time
some
of
the
faith
came
to
show
me
the
word
and
share
with
me
it
truth
i
wa
live
happili
and
moral
without
acknowledg
the
exist
of
a
suprem
be
i
have
though
read
the
bibl
sever
time
over
in
it
entireti
and
have
studi
it
thoroughli
it
contain
truth
in

and
i
consid
jesu
to
be
one
of
the
most
moral
of
human
be
to
have
live
in
fact
i
darnnear
idol
the
guy
but
there
no
ration
reason
for
me
to
except
god
exist
plea
rethink
thi
last
paragraph
if
there
is
no
god
which
seem
to
be
your
current
belief
then
jesu
wa
either
a
liar
or
a
complet
nut
becaus
not
onli
did
he
assert
that
god
exist
but
he
claim
to
be
god
himself

how
then
