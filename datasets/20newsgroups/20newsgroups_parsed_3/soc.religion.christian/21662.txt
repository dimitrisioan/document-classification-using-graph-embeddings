document
and
insight
zane
i
dont

a
nice
scriptur
answer

whi
i
believ
it
is
at
best
un
profit
for
christian
to
engag
in
thi
type
of
activ
heresi
hunt
my
repli
whi
do
you
call
it
heresi
hunt
hunt
impli
it
isnt
readili
access
or
avail
thi
movement
is
the
fastest
grow
movement
in
christendom
hagin
ha
sold
over
million
book
and
booklet
hinn
ha
sold
more
book
in
the
last
coupl
of
year
than
swindol
and
dobson
combin
fred
price
ha
the
largest
church
in
term
of
seat
capac
in
the
usa
doesnt
sound
like
much
hunt
is
need
it
is
scriptur
to
expos
doctrin
error
i
gave
some
vers
to
you
befor
more
can
be
given
most
of
the
epistl
were
written
due
to
error
doctrin
practic
in
the
church
the
earli
church
had
numer
council
to
expos
error
and
heresi
it
not
a
new
thing
rememb
luther
zane
i
would
like
to
point
out
though
that
histor
those
who
hunt
heret
often
end
up
caus
a
bigger
mess
than
the
heret
but
thi
is
my
un
document
opinion
my
repli
if
you
can
provid
document
it
would
be
appreci
read
ephesian
esp
v
and
and
tell
me
what
caus
disun
and
immatur
in
the
bodi
eph
till
we
all
come
to
the
uniti
of
the
faith
and
of
the
knowledg
of
the
son
of
god
to
a
perfect
man
to
the
measur
of
the
statur
of
the
full
of
christ
that
we
should
no
longer
be
child
toss
to
and
fro
and
carri
about
with
everi
wind
of
doctrin
by
the
trickeri
of
men
in
the
cun
crafti
of
deceit
plot
disun
contrari
to
popular
opinion
isnt
caus
by
expos
error
it
caus
by
error
zane
there
are
mani
who
probabl
give
no
place
for
see
the
scriptur
a
document
a
spiritu
develop
or
growth
in
it
writer
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
fieri
paul
of
the
letter
to
the
galatian
mellow
and
matur
into
the
one
who
lose
all
for
the
sake
of
love
in
the
end
my
repli
most
scholar
believ
paul
wrote
timothi
last
let
examin
hi
admonit
to
tim
to
ascertain
how
mellow
he
had
becom
ti
hold
fast
the
pattern
of
sound
word
which
you
have
heard
from
me
in
faith
and
love
which
are
in
christ
jesu
that
good
thing
which
wa
commit
to
you
keep
by
the
holi
spirit
who
dwell
in
u
thi
you
know
that
all
those
in
asia
have
turn
away
from
me
among
whom
are
phygellu
and
hermogen
ti
be
dilig
to
present
yourself
approv
to
god
a
worker
who
doe
not
need
to
be
asham
rightli
divid
the
word
of
truth
but
shun
profan
and
idl
babbl
for
they
will
increas
to
more
ungodli
and
their
messag
will
spread
like
cancer
hymenaeu
and
philetu
are
of
thi
sort
who
have
stray
concern
the
truth
say
that
the
resurrect
is
alreadi
past
and
they
overthrow
the
faith
of
some
ti
and
a
servant
of
the
lord
must
not
quarrel
but
be
gentl
to
all
abl
to
teach
patient
in
humil
correct
those
who
are
in
opposit
if
god
perhap
will
grant
them
repent
so
that
they
may
know
the
truth
and
that
they
may
come
to
their
sen
and
escap
the
snare
of
the
devil
have
been
taken
captiv
by
him
to
do
hi

for
of
thi
sort
are
those
who
creep

led
away
by
variou
lust
alway

so
do
these
also
resist
the
truth
men
of
corrupt

they
will

no
further
for

so
did
john
jo
i
wrote
to
the
church
but
diotreph
who
love
to
have
the
preemin
among
them
doe
not
receiv
u
therefor
if
i
come
i
will
call
to
mind
hi
deed
which
he
doe
prate
against
u
with
malici
word
and
not
content
with
that
he
himself
doe
not
receiv
the
brother
and
forbid
those
who
wish
to
put
them
out
of
the
church
jesu
also
singl
out
teach
and
doctrin
rev
but
i
have
a
few
thing
against
you
becaus
you
have
there
those
who
hold
the
doctrin
of
balaam
who
taught
balak
to
put
a
stumbl
block
befor
the
child
of
israel
to
eat
thing
sacrif
to
idol
and
to
commit
sexual
immor
thu
you
also
have
those
who
hold
the
doctrin
of
the
nicolaitan
which
thing
i
hate
repent
or
els
i
will
come
to
you
quickli
and
will
fight
against
them
with
the
sword
of
my
mouth
rev
nevertheless
i
have
a
few
thing
against
you
becaus
you
allow
that
woman
jezebel
who
call
herself
a
prophetess
to
teach
and
seduc
my
servant
to
commit
sexual
immor
and
eat
thing
sacrif
to
idol
and
i
gave
her
time
to
repent
of
her
sexual
immor
and
she
did
not
repent
inde
i
will
cast
her
into
a
sickb
and
those
who
commit
adulteri
with
her
into
great
tribul
unless
they
repent
of
their
deed
i
will
kill
her
child
with
death
and
all
the
church
shall
know
that
i
am
he
who
search
the
mind
and
heart
and
i
will
give
to
each
one
of
you
accord
to
your
work
zane
i
question
too
the
purpos
of
those
who
write
book
and
build
ministri
on
the
fault
deliber
or
otherwis
of
other
mayb
if
they
would
wander
around
in
the
desert
eat
locust
and
honey
or
bare
cakeswith
no
worldli
good
at
stake
money
to
be
made
or
no
reput
to
maintain
i
would
question
their
motif
consciou
or
otherwis
le
my
repli
i
wont
comment
on
thi
becaus
it
deal
with
the
intang
motif
of
other
but
even
if
they
had
bad
motif
rememb
what
paul
said
phi
some
inde
preach
christ
even
from
envi
and
strife
and
some
also
from
good
will
the
former
preach
christ
from
selfish
ambit
not
sincer
suppos
to
add
afflict
to
my
chain
but
the
latter
out
of
love
know
that
i
am
appoint
for
the
defens
of
the
gospel
what
then
onli
that
in
everi
way
whether
in
pretens
or
in
truth
christ
is
preach
and
in
thi
i
rejoic
ye
and
will
rejoic
zane
if
we
want
to
be
true
to
the
admonit
of
scriptur
mani
of
which
you
list
about
protect
ourselv
and
the
flock
from
wolf
and
wind
of
doctrin
i
suggest
we
start
by
allow
the
wolfprogram
in
our
own
noetic
pastur
to
be
nail
to
the
cross
my
repli
pleas
explain
zane
secondli
i
suggest
ani
heresi
hunt
be
restrict
to
our
own
fellowship
which
in
the
strict
scriptur
sens
is
the
local
citychurch
my
repli
if
heresi
wa
not
be
propag
over
the
mass
medium
then
it
may
not
be
need
to
go
mass
medium
with
the
exposur
unfortun
heresi
is
be
taught
not
just
in
copeland
church
or
hagin
or

etc
no
pastor
or
church
leader
know
what
materi
the
sheep
are
feed
on
outsid
the
