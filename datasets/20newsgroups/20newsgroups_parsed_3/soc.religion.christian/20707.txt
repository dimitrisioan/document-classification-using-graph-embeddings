william
hargreav
write
im
a
commit
christian
that
is
battl
with
a
problem
i
know
that
roman
talk
about
how
we
are
save
by
our
faith
not
our
deed
yet
hebrew
and
jame
say
that
faith
without
deed
is
useless
say
you
fool
do
you
still
think
that
just
believ
is
enough
actual
i
dont
think
there
is
ani
conflict
if
we
realli
understand
what
these
passag
say
first
what
is
faith
if
you
studi
the
mean
of
the
greek
and
hebrew
word
so
translat
i
think
you
will
come
to
the
conclus
that
the
word
mean
a
lot
more
than
mere
belief
faith
mean
both
trust
and
action
if
you
do
not
put
your
belief
into
action
it
simpli
can
not
qualifi
a
faith
i
think
thi
is
what
jame
mean
when
he
say
that
faith
without
work
is
dead
and
i
will
show
you
my
faith
by
my
work
rememb
jame
wa
write
to
the
twelv
tribe
which
are
scatter
abroad
thi
probabl
mean
he
wa
write
to
those
who
would
hear
the
gospel
much
later
and
wouldnt
understand
the
mean
of
the
origin
greek
inde
i
suspect
jame
wa
write
to
u
today
among
other
he
intend
to
reach
paul
on
the
other
hand
wrote
mostli
to
the
peopl
of
the
roman
empir
who
gener
understood
the
mean
of
the
greek
anoth
key
to
whi
there
is
no
conflict
is
to
look
at
paul
statement
in
their
context
i
think
you
will
find
that
when
paul
contrast
faith
and
work
it
is
in
the
context
of
compar
the
gospel
with
the
law
mean
the
law
of
mose
thi
wa
the
great
burden
of
paul
life
a
the
apostl
to
the
gentil
he
would
go
convert
a
bunch
of
peopl
then
the
judiz
would
come
along
and
tri
to
convinc
them
that
they
also
had
to
obey
the
law
of
mose
cf
act
chapter
in
thi
context
paul
condemn
the
idea
of
be
save
by
the
work
of
the
law
say
that
we
are
save
by
the
blood
of
jesu
and
our
faith
in
him
i
believ
that
a
better
translat
for
today
would
be
that
we
are
save
by
faith
i
think
faith
today
ha
a
mean
closer
to
what
the
origin
writer
intend
now
if
someon
is
fulli
believ
but
there
life
is
total
lead
by
themselv
and
not
by
god
accord
to
roman
that
person
is
still
save
by
there
faith
i
think
you
misunderstand
roman
what
paul
is
realli
say
is
that
god
prefer
a
faith
gentil
who
doe
not
keep
kosher
to
a
kosher
jew
who
fail
to
stay
faith
in
the
more
import
matter
of
follow
the
lord
and
have
chariti
toward
hi
fellow
but
then
there
is
the
bit
which
say
that
god
prefer
someon
who
is
cold
to
him
ie
doesnt
know
him
condemn
so
a
lukewarm
christian
someon
who
know
and
believ
in
god
but
doesnt
make
ani
attempt
to
live
by
the
bibl
in
the
sen
of
faith
describ
abov
you
can
not
have
real
faith
and
be
lukewarm
if
you
know
god
but
are
lukewarm
unfaith
you
are
wors
off
than
the
person
who
never
heard
of
him
rememb
jesu
in
the
parabl
of
the
pearl
of
great
price
mat
and
again
in
the
one
on
the
treasur
hidden
in
the
field
mat
indic
that
the
price
of
the
kingdom
of
god
is
all
we
have
i
agre
with
you
in
gener
includ
the
fact
that
pisti
ha
some
of
the
forc
of
faith
howev
if
you
take
that
too
far
you
can
end
up
with
someth
that
paul
definit
would
not
have
intend
be
faith
mean
follow
god
in
all
thing
to
say
that
we
are
save
by
be
faith
is
veri
close
to
say
that
we
are
save
by
commit
no
sin
i
assum
that
not
what
you
meant
i
have
almost
given
up
on
find
a
specif
verbal
formula
that
complet
captur
thi
howev
i
think
paul
is
describ
what
id
call
a
basic
orient
includ
aspect
such
a
trust
and
commit
jesu
speak
of
it
a
rebirth
which
impli
a
basic
chang
we
may
still
do
thing
that
are
sin
and
may
fail
to
show
the
new
life
in
christ
in
mani
situat
where
we
should
but
in
ani
christian
there
had
better
be
the
basic
chang
in
orient
that
jesu
call
be
born
again
