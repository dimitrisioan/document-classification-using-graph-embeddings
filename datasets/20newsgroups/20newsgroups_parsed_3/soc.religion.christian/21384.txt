mari
assumpt
a
few
point
about
mari
be
taken
into
heaven
at
the
end
of
her
life
on
earth
one
piec
of
evid
for
mari
assumpt
into
heaven
is
the
fact
that
no
christian
church
ever
claim
to
be
the
sight
where
she
wa
buri
some
christian
church
claim
to
be
locat
at
the
final
rest
place
of
peter
mark
and
other
saint
but
no
one
ever
claim
to
poss
the
bodi
of
mari
the
greatest
of
the
saint
whi
becaus
everyon
knew
that
she
had
been
taken
up
into
heaven
although
there
is
no
definit
scriptur
proof
for
the
assumpt
of
mari
some
passag
seem
suggest
like
the
passag
in
revel
that
describ
a
woman
give
birth
to
a
son
and
later
be
crown
in
the
heaven
of
cours
the
woman
in
thi
passag
ha
other
interpret
she
can
also
be
taken
a
symbol
for
the
church
the
assumpt
of
mari
make
sens
becaus
of
her
relationship
to
christ
jesu
perfect
god
and
perfect
man
fulfil
the
requir
of
the
law
perfectli
under
the
law
god
gave
to
u
we
are
to
honor
our
mother
and
father
and
christ
act
of
take
hi
mother
into
heaven
is
part
of
hi
fulfil
of
that
law
also
he
took
hi
flesh
from
her
so
it
seem
appropri
that
he
decid
not
to
allow
her
flesh
to
rot
in
the
grave
one
last
point
an
excathol
attempt
to
explain
cathol
doctrin
on
the
assumpt
by
assert
it
is
connect
to
a
belief
that
mari
did
not
die
thi
is
not
a
correct
summari
of
what
cathol
believ
the
dogma
of
the
assumpt
wa
care
phrase
to
avoid
say
whether
mari
did
or
did
not
die
in
fact
the
consensu
among
cathol
theologian
seem
to
be
that
mari
in
fact
did
die
thi
would
make
sens
christ
die
and
hi
mother
who
wait
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
would
want
to
share
in
hi
death
