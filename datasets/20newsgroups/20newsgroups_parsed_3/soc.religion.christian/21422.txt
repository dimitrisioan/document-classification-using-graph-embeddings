i
am
interest
in
find
out
whi
peopl
becom
atheist
after
have
believ
in
some
godgod
in
convers
with
them
on
other
group
ive
often
sen
anger
or
hostil
though
i
dont
mean
to
impli
that
all
atheist
are
angri
or
hostil
it
doe
seem
to
be
one
motiv
for
give
up
faith
thu
some
atheism
might
result
from
broken
id
like
to
field
thi
one
if
i
may
although
i
am
a
believ
in
and
follow
of
christ
my
experi
with
religion
havent
been
all
that
posit
in
fact
there
wa
one
point
in
my
life
when
for
about
three
day
i
simpli
couldnt
believ
in
the
exist
of
god
anyway
when
i
look
back
upon
the
troubl
ive
had
they
seem
to
fall
into
two
categori
impuls
to
unbelief
that
result
from
logic
contradict
and
impuls
to
unbelief
that
result
from
frustrat
with
god
the
first
categori
doesnt
occur
to
me
much
anymor
a
i
have
work
through
most
of
the
argument
for
the
nonexist
of
god
but
way
back
when
these
would
caus
me
some
problem
and
i
would
have
to
struggl
with
my
faith
to
continu
to
believ
i
can
see
where
other
le
stubborn
than
i
and
i
do
mean
stubborn
stubbor
ha
often
been
the
onli
thing
stand
between
me
an
atheism
from
time
to
time
would
fail
the
second
categori
aris
out
of
some
longterm
person
difficulti
and
the
struggl
to
live
my
life
a
god
would
have
me
live
it
without
live
my
life
a
other
would
tell
me
how
god
would
have
me
live
it
a
good
exampl
of
thi
is
my
struggl
with
the
more
radic
christian
i
meet
i
am
not
nor
have
i
ever
been
on
fire
for
chirst
and
i
dont
think
i
ever
want
to
be
nevertheless
i
am
not
lukewarm
about
my
faith
so
i
dont
realli
fit
in
with
the
mainstream
either
quit
natur
i
feel
a
lot
of
anxieti
about
my
disloc
within
christian
societi
and
it
can
lead
to
a
lot
of
intern
tension
when
i
want
to
do
what
i
know
is
right
but
when
anoth
part
of
me
believ
that
what
i
want
to
do
is
wrong
becaus
all
the
other
christian
think
so
to
quit
natur
thi
tension
ha
a
destruct
effect
on
my
relationship
with
god
and
dure
all
of
thi
intern
strife
there
atheism
sit
there
like
the
promis
land
no
rule
no
respons
no
need
to
live
up
to
anyon
expect
but
my
own
complet
freedom
of
cours
it
all
an
illus
but
nevertheless
it
a
veri
appeal
illus
especi
when
the
socal
peopl
of
god
are
behav
like
total
twit
i
can
easili
understand
whi
someon
would
go
that
rout
and
would
be
hostil
to
ever
come
back
imho
mani
of
the
formerchristiansturnedatheistswhoarenowact
hostiletochristian
are
so
becaus
their
experi
with
christ
and
god
wasnt
a
veri
peac
one

one

courtesi

follow
a
final
reason
whi
peopl
becom
atheist
is
becaus
christian
do
not
have
a
veri
good
reput
right
now
one
of
the
thing
that
attract
peopl
to
christian
in
the
ancient
day
wa
the
love
that
christian
obvious
had
for
one
anoth
and
the
world
around
them
unlik
the
rest
of
the
world
christian
commun
activ
care
for
their
poor
and
the
christian
rich
did
not
trod
on
the
back
of
their
poorer
brother
but
bent
down
to
help
them
christian
were
known
for
live
exemplari
live
even
if
they
were
thought
to
be
traitor
to
the
state
becaus
they
wouldnt
sacrific
to
the
empor
nowaday
courtesi
of
the
medium
and
some
christian
leader
who
lost
christ
on
their
way
to
power
peopl
see
christian
a
sexuallyrepress
hippocrit
busibodi
who
want
to
remak
societi
into
a
facist
version
of
their
own
moral
view
there
are
a
lot
more
reason
whi
peopl
becom
atheist
but
i
dont
have
time
to
go
into
them
right
now
