the

introduc
the

alan
werent
free
from

your
point
is
a
littl
obscur
here
but
i
think
you
are
say
that
christ
use
the
innoc
of
newborn
babe
a
a
metaphor
for
spiritu
rebirth
but
thi
is
not
what
he
did
if
you
look
at
the
text
he
did
not
speak
of
spiritu
rebirth
but
of
spiritu
birth
we
are
born
of
the
spirit
onc
not
twice
or
sever
time
we
are
also
born
of
the
flesh
onc
the
lord
make
it
clear
that
these
are
separ
and
differ
event
it
is
true
that
other
scriptur
refer
to
spiritu
birth
a
rebirth
becaus
it
is
a
second
birth
for
exampl
titu
but
it
is
not
a
second
spiritu
birth
the
onli
thing
the
two
birth
have
in
common
is
the
concept
of
birth
which
is
use
a
a
symbol
of
new
life
not
of
innoc
when
an
infant
is
born

conceiv
a

is
begunbut
it
is
neither
innoc
nor
righteou
similarli
when
that
