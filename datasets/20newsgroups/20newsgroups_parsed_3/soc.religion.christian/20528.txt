whole
mess
of
other

yet
i

to
even
suggest
that

it
clear
that
we

paul
conditt
reveal
hi
feel
in
case
you
couldnt
tell
i
get
extrem
angri
and
upset
when
i
see
thing
like
thi
instead
of
ration
our
own
fear
and
phobia
we
need
to
be
reach
out
to
peopl
with
aid
and
other
social
unaccept
diseas
whether
they
got
the
diseas
through
their
own
action
or
not
is
irrelev
they
still
need
jesu
the
first
issu
you
bring
up
is
your
anger
it
is
obvious
wrong
to
be
angri
gal
for
ani
reason
especi
extrem
angri
which
is
on
par
with
hatr
jesu
ha
everi
reason
to
be
angri
at
u
for
put
him
on
the
cross
with
our
sin
yet
hi
prayer
wa
forgiv
them
father
they
know
not
what
they
do
know
how
forgiv
jesu
ha
been
with
me
call
me
to
be
more
forgiv
with
everyon
out
of
love
for
him
pleas
dont
give
in
to
anger
it
will
onli
caus
foolish
quarrel
and
more
bad
feel
it
okay
if
you
read
someth
that
bother
you
but
you
need
to
address
it
in
a
love
way
if
right
now
i
felt
like
someon
out
there
wa
say
that
god
punish
gay
or
sexual
immor
peopl
with
aid
becaus
they
deserv
punish
that
other
dont
then
i
would
frame
a
respons
someth
like
thi
it
make
me
feel
veri
sad
for
someon
to
believ
that
aid
which
is
simpli
a
harm
diseas
not
so
unlik
ani
other
is
god
punish
for
peopl
who
have
commit
certain
sin
god
love
all
of
hi
child
equal
and
rejoic
when
a
singl
one
come
back
to
him
we
will
all
be
judg
after
we
die
but
until
then
we
all
have
the
opportun
to
accept
god
grace
by
earnestli
seek
after
him
with
all
of
our
heart
believ
the
gospel
testimoni
repent
of
our
sin
confess
that
jesu
is
lord
at
baptism
and
live
a
new
life
for
him
let
u
not
judg
someon
to
be
etern
condemn
god
arm
is
not
to
short
to
save
he
will
do
anyth
he
can
to
move
a
harden
heart
or
a
misl
person
he
work
for
the
good
of
all
men
even
through
the
worst
of
situat
he
ha
set
the
time
and
place
for
all
men
that
they
may
perhap
reach
out
and
find
him
the
second
issu
you
bring
up
is
see
peopl
ration
their
fear
of
peopl
with
aid
fortun
what
you
describ
a
see
is
actual
misperceiv
you
have
been
miss
the
point
made
in
the
earlier
post
and
react
in
anger
to
attitud
that
havent
been
express
i
know
that
it
sometim
hard
to
discount
your
percept
but
pleas
tri
to
be
openmind
you
are
quit
correct
in
say
that
we
should
reach
out
to
all
peopl
becaus
they
all
need
jesu
thi
is
what
my
brother
and
sister
and
i
do
on
a
daili
basi
if
you
would
like
to
send
me
the
name
of
the
citi
and
state
you
live
in
i
will
find
and
get
you
in
touch
with
some
brother
who
have
aid
or
know
peopl
with
aid
and
live
nearbi
you
so
that
you
can
see
the
love
attitud
for
yourself
the
third
issu
you
bring
up
is
the
import
of
how
some
individu
contract
aid
how
someon
get
aid
is
onli
relev
to
their
salvat
in
that
there
may
be
repet
involv
the
import
point
to
be
made
howev
is
that
not
listen
to
god
command
or
advic
or
warn
ie
sin
caus
harm
or
misfortun
to
yourself
and
other
for
thi
reason
a
good
way
to
prevent
the
misfortun
of
aid
which
can
be
transmit
in
sin
way
is
to
listen
to
god
advic
and
have
sex
onli
with
your
wife
or
husband
i
hope
that
you
are
feel
better
now
