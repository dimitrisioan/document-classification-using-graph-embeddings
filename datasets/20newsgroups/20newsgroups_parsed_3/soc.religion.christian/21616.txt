re
major
view
of
the
triniti
in
articl
you
write
i
fear
orthodox
theologian
have
been
overli
in
love
with
paradox
to
the
extent
that
wellmean
peopl
think
theyv
just
flatout
confus
there
no
problem
with
thing
be
both
and
eg
if
the
are
differ
part
of
the
but
theyr
in
some
way
differ
aspect
mode
or
whatev
of
one
god
if
you
accept
econom
trinitarian
it
possibl
that
you
dont
have
ani
substant
differ
with
the
standard
view
is
it
possibl
that
you
just
dont
find
the
neoplaton
explan
illumin
clh
i
would
put
it
stronger
than
that
i
consid
it
nonsens
simpli
put
i
do
not
see
ani
way
that
a
platon
essenc
could
have
ani
real
exist
essenc
in
the
platon
sen
doe
not
have
ani
refer
a
far
a
i
can
tell
it
is
just
an
imaginari
concept
invent
to
provid
an
explan
for
thing
better
explain
in
other
way
so
to
attribut
an
essenc
to
god
is
to
attribut
to
him
someth
that
doe
not
exist
thu
the
orthodox
platon
formul
seem
to
leav
the
uniti
of
god
in
limbo
sinc
it
is
base
on
a
nonexist
essenc
thu
fail
to
avoid
the
veri
problem
it
wa
suppos
to
address
thu
to
me
the
uniti
of
god
must
be
primari
and
the
trialiti
must
be
secondari
must
be
modal
or
aspectu
relat
to
role
or
to
mode
of
interact
sinc
otherwis
there
is
no
mean
to
say
god
is
one
formerli
tdatirvsarima

i
think
one

a

someth
