there
may
be
some
misunderstand
over
term
here
i
believ
jesu
onli
origin
wa
in
the
context
of
baptism
these
are
folk
who
believ
that
baptism
should
be
done
with
a
formula
mention
onli
jesu
rather
than
father
son
and
holi
spirit
thi
may
have
doctrin
implic
but
a
far
a
i
know
it
doe
not
mean
that
these
folk
deni
the
exist
or
divin
of
the
father
im
not
the
right
one
to
describ
thi
theolog
and
in
fact
i
think
there
may
be
sever
includ
what
would
classic
be
call
monophysit
or
arian
two
rather
differ
view
a
well
a
some
who
have
belief
that
are
probabl
consist
with
trinitarian
standard
but
who
wont
use
trinitarian
languag
becaus
they
misunderstand
it
or
simpli
becaus
it
is
not
biblic
