cathol
liturgi
the
problem
with
cathol
liturgi
are
like
to
continu
for
some
time
the
problem
is
in
a
nutshel
thi
the
liturgi
is
a
symbol
action
in
other
word
cathol
do
or
should
believ
that
the
sign
dure
the
mass
water
bless
vestment
altar
relic
etc
are
real
that
is
the
sprinkl
of
water
bestow
real
almost
tangibl
holi
the
vestment
are
a
real
indic
of
real
sacr
time
the
point
of
a
symbol
is
that
it
is
understood
by
all
to
be
connect
to
an
underli
real
refer
thi
kind
of
think
preclud
analysi
holi
water
is
not
holi
becaus
of
anyth
it
simpli
is
holi
but
modern
western
find
it
extrem
difficult
especi
if
well
educ
to
think
of
the
mass
a
a
symbol
we
are
more
like
to
see
it
a
a
sign
ie
an
action
that
repres
grace
but
which
could
be
replac
with
other
sign
in
concret
term
thi
mean
the
mass
ha
becom
a
commerci
for
god
grace
rather
than
the
real
thing
you
can
mess
around
with
a
commerci
in
a
way
you
wouldnt
dare
with
the
real
thing
ask
cocacola
co
these
attitud
have
been
encourag
by
liturgi
workshop
etc
which
instead
of
focus
on
how
to
do
do
liturgi
have
focus
on
how
to
creat
a
mean
in
liturgi
you
can
onli
creat
sign
symbol
have
to
come
from
god
or
the
heart
or
somewher
deeper
than
analysi
the
most
dramat
exampl
of
thi
shift
in
understand
ha
been
in
the
treatment
of
the
sacr
speci
the
consecr
host
and
wine
now
with
pita
bread
etc
it
is
common
to
come
away
from
the
altar
with
hand
cover
in
particl
if
the
host
is
a
sign
of
grace
thi
isnt
and
issu
but
cathol
in
the
past
would
have
been
distraught
at
thi
real
desacr
of
the
real
symbol
of
jesu
bodi
modern
cathol
liturgi
is
caught
in
thi
epistemolog
shift
we
tri
to
perfrom
the
old
rite
but
then
we
have
some
liturgomaniac
priest
get
up
and
explain
what
we
are
do
so
we
stop
do
it
and
start
pretend
to
do
it
thi
is
not
a
soul
fill
experi
it
doesnt
help
btw
that
we
have
got
stuck
witha
huge
amount
of
two
and
three
chord
ersatzfolk
music
again
a
result
of
misanalysi
complic
tune
are
in
fact
easier
to
rememb
than
simpl
one
thi
wa
the
geniu
of
wesley
and
the
c
anglican
hymn
writer
taiz
is
onli
slightli
better
what
are
we
to
do
well
i
suggest
reject
the
parish
system
if
it
doesnt
work
for
you
search
out
a
church
where
the
liturgi
is
well
prepar
not
wellexplain
they
exist
in
everi
citi
thi
is
not
btw
a
matter
of
particular
style
the
music
might
be
old
or
new
it
is
the
attitud
of
the
church
that
count
also
note
that
a
conserv
liturgi
hark
back
to
prevatican
