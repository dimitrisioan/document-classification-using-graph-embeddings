of

seem
a
though
they
do
not
requir
incred
pervers
interpret
in
order
to

seen
a
condemn
homosexu
the
kind
of
interpret
i
see
a
incred
pervers
is
that
appli
to
the
stori
of
sodom
a
if
it
were
a
blanket
equat
of
homosexu
behavior
and
rape
sinc
christian
cite
the
bibl
in
such
a
context
should
be
presum
to
have
at
least
read
the
stori
it
amount
to
slander
a
charg
that
homosexu
rape
to
use
that
against
u
do
not
be
deceiv
neither
fornic

nor
adulter
nor

nor
homosexu
nor

nor

nor
drunkard
nor
revil
nor
swindler
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of

and
such
were
some
of
you
i
cor
the
moder
adequ
discu
the
circular
of
your
use
of
porneia
in
thi
i
think
we
can
all
agre
with
paul
that
there
are
some
kind
of
activ
that
could
be
name
by
fornic
or
theft
or
covet
or
revil
or
drunken
which
would
well
deserv
condemn
we
may
or
may
not
agre
to
the
bound
of
those
categori
howev
and
the
veri
fact
that
they
are
argu
over
suggest
that
not
onli
is
the
matter
not
at
all
clear
but
that
paul
an
excel
rhetorician
had
no
interest
in
make
them
clear
leav
matter
rather
to
our
spiritl
decis
with
all
the
uncomfort
livingwithotherread
that
ha
domin
christian
discuss
of
all
these
area
homosexu
behavior
is
no
differ
i
and
the
other
gay
christian
i
know
are
adam
in
condemn
rape
heterosexu
or
homosexu
and
child
molest
heterosexu
or
homosexu
and
even
the
possibl
harmless
but
obsess
kind
of
sex
heterosexu
or
homosexu
that
would
stand
condemn
by
paul
in
the
veri
continu
of
the
chapter
you
cite
may
i
mildli
suggest
that
what
paul
doe
in
hi
letter
that
you
want
to
use
is
perhap
a
good
guid
to
hi
mean
i
am
free
to
do
anyth
you
say
ye
but
not
everyth
is
for
my
good
no
doubt
i
am
free
to
do
anyth
but
i
for
one
will
not
let
anyth
make
free
with
me
cor
which
is
a
restat
that
we
must
have
no
other
god
befor
god
a
command
neither
i
nor
ani
other
gay
christian
wish
to
break
some
peopl
are
inde
involv
in
obsess
driven
mode
of
sexual
behavior
it
is
just
a
wrong
though
slightli
le
incendiari
so
it
a
secondari
argument
from
the
phobic
conting
to
equat
homosexu
with
such
behavior
a
to
equat
it
with
the
rape
of
god
messeng
i
wont
deal
with
the
exegesi
of
leviticu
except
veri
tangenti
fundament
you
are
exhibit
the
same
circular
here
a
in
your
assumpt
that
you
know
what
porneia
mean
there
are
plenti
of
law
prohibit
sexual
behavior
to
be
found
in
leviticu
most
of
which
christian
ignor
complet
they
never
even
bother
to
examin
them
they
just
assum
that
they
know
which
one
are
moral
and
which
one
are
ritual
well
i
have
news
for
you
ani
anthropolog
cours
should
sensit
you
to
ritual
and
clean
v
unlcean
a
categori
in
an
aw
lot
of
societi
we
have
them
too
but
buri
pretti
deep
and
i
can
not
see
ani
ground
for
distinguish
these
bit
of
leviticu
from
the
ritual
law
which
no
christian
i
know
feel
appli
to
u
im
dead
seriou
here
when
peopl
start
go
on
a
they
do
in
thi
matter
about
how
repuls
and
unnatur
our
act
are
and
what
do
they
know
about
it
huh
it
is
a
solid
clue
to
the
same
sort
of
arbitrari
cultur
inculc
a
the
american
prejudic
against
eat
insect
on
what
basi
other
than
assum
your
conclus
can
you
say
that
the
law
against
malemal
intercours
in
leviticu
is
not
a
part
of
the
ritual
law
for
those
christian
who
do
think
that
some
part
of
leviticu
can
be
law
for
christian
while
other
are
not
even
to
be
thought
about
it
is
incumb
on
you
in
everi
case
handl
on
it
own
merit
to
determin
whi
you
pick
one
and
ignor
anoth
i
frankli
think
the
whole
effort
misguid
reread
paul
no
doubt
i
am
free
to
do
anyth
but
christian
have
a
criterion
to
use
for
make
our
judgment
on
thi
the
great
command
of
love
for
god
and
neighbor
if
you
can
not
go
through
leviticu
and
decid
each
command
there
on
that
basi
then
your
own
arbitrari
select
from
it
is
simpli
idiosyncraci
in
thi
context
it
is
remark
offens
to
say
i
notic
that
the
vers
forbid
bestial
immedi
follow
the
vers
prohibit
what
appear
to
be
homosexu
intercours
well
latida
so
what
thi
is
almost
a
slimey
an
argument
a
the
one
that
homosexu
rape
i
know
of
no
one
who
argu
serious
though
one
can
alway
find
joker
in
defens
of
bestial
it
is
absolut
irrelev
and
incompar
to
the
issu
gay
christian
do
rais
which
concern
sexual
activ
within
commit
consensu
human
adult
realtionship
so
that
your
bring
it
up
is
no
more
relev
than
the
law
of
kashrut
if
you
can
not
address
the
actual
issu
you
are
be
bloodi
dishonest
in
trail
thi
red
her
in
front
of
the
world
if
you
want
to
address
bestial
that
is
your
busi
not
mine
and
attempt
to
torpedo
a
seriou
issu
by
use
what
is
in
our
cultur
a
ridicul
joke
show
that
you
have
no
interest
in
hear
u
a
human
be
you
want
to
dismiss
u
and
use
the
sleaziest
mean
you
can
think
of
to
do
so
jesu
and
paul
both
expound
veri
explictli
and
in
consider
length
the
central
linchpin
of
christian
moral
thought
we
are
requir
to
love
one
anoth
and
all
els
depend
on
that
gay
and
lesbian
christ
ian
challeng
you
to
address
the
issu
on
those
term
and
all
we
get
in
return
are
cheap
debat
trick
attempt
to
sidetrack
the
issu
christian
no
doubt
veri
sincer
one
keep
show
up
here
and
in
everi
corner
of
usenet
and
the
world
and
all
they
ever
do
is
spout
these
same
old
vers
which
they
obvious
have
never
thought
about
mayb
never
even
read
in
total
ignor
of
the
issu
rais
slander
u
with
the
vilest
charg
of
child
abus
or
whatev
their
perfervid
mind
can
manag
to
conjur
up
toss
out
red
her
with
they
suppos
great
emot
forc
to
caus
reader
to
dismiss
our
wit
without
even
take
the
troubl
to
find
out
what
it
is
such
behavior
should
shame
anyon
who
claim
to
have
seen
truth
in
christ
whi
for
god
preciou
sake
do
you
peopl
quot
irrelev
vers
to
condemn
peopl
you
dont
know
and
wont
even
take
the
troubl
to
listen
to
befor
you
start
your
condemn
is
that
love
your
neighbor
god
forbid
is
that
how
you
obey
the
repeat
command
to
not
judg
or
condemn
other
christ
and
paul
spend
order
of
magnitud
more
time
in
insist
on
thi
than
the
halfdozen
obscur
word
in
paul
that
you
are
so
bloodi
readi
to
take
a
licens
to
do
what
god
tell
you
not
to
do
whi
for
god
sake
for
god
did
not
send
the
son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
world
but
that
the
world
might
be
save
through
him
whoever
belief
in
him
is
not
condemn
but
whoever
doe
not
believ
ha
alreadi
been
condemn
for
refus
to
believ
in
the
name
of
god
onli
son
now
the
judgment
is
thi
the
light
ha
come
into
the
world
but
men
have
prefer
dark
to
light
becaus
their
deed
were
evil
for
everyon
who
practic
wicked
hate
the
light
and
doe
not
come
near
the
light
for
fear
hi
deed
will
be
expos
but
he
who
act
in
truth
come
into
the
light
so
that
it
may
be
shown
that
hi
deed
are
done
in
god
john
for
long
age
we
mani
of
u
have
been
confus
by
evil
counsel
from
evil
men
and
told
that
if
we
came
to
the
light
we
would
be
shame
and
reject
some
of
u
despair
and
took
to
cours
that
probabl
do
show
a
sin
shun
of
god
light
bless
are
those
whose
spirit
have
been
crush
by
the
selfright
they
shall
be
justifi
howev
we
have
seen
the
truth
and
the
truth
is
the
light
of
human
and
we
now
know
that
it
is
not
we
who
fear
the
light
but
our
enemi
who
fear
the
light
of
our
wit
and
will
do
everyth
they
can
to
shadow
it
with
the
dark
of
fals
wit

i
say
you
are
