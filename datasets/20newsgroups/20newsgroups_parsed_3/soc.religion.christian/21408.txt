howev
unlik
the
calvinist

i
hold

resist
otherwis
you
end
up
with
the
idioci
of

the

save
will
of

timothi
for
god
must
give
enough
grace
to
all
to
be
save
but
onli
the
elect
who
he
foreknew
are
predestin
and
receiv
the
grace
of
final
perserver
which
guarante
heaven
thi
doe
not
mean
that
those
without
that
grace
cant
be
save
it
just
mean
that
god
foreknew
their
obstinaci
and
chose
not
to
give
it
to
them
know
they
would
not
need
it
a
they
had
freeli
chosen
hell
peopl
who
are
save
are
save
by
the
grace
of
god
and
not
by
their
own
effort
for
it
wa
god
who
dispos
them
to
himself
and
predestin
them
to
becom
saint
but
those
who
perish
in
everlast
fire
perish
becaus
they
harden
their
heart
and
chose
to
perish
thu
they
were
deserv
of
god
punish
a
they
had
reject
their
creator
and
sin
against
the
work
of
the
holi
spirit
ye
it
is
up
to
god
to
judg
but
he
will
onli
mete
out
that
punish
at
the
last
judgement
well
i
would
hold
that
a
god
most
certainli
give
everybodi
some
bless
for
what
good
they
have
done
even
if
it
wa
onli
a
littl
for
those
he
cant
bless
in
the
next
life
he
bless
in
thi
one
and
those
he
will
not
punish
in
the
next
life
will
be
chastis
in
thi
one
or
in
purgatori
for
their
sin
everi
sin
incur
some
tempor
punish
thu
god
will
punish
it
unless
satisfact
is
made
for
it
cf
samuel
david
sin
of
adulteri
and
murder
were
forgiven
but
he
wa
still
punish
with
the
death
of
hi
child
and
i
need
not
point
out
the
idea
of
punish
becaus
of
god
judgement
is
quit
prevel
in
the
bibl
sodom
and
gommorrah
mose
bar
from
the
holi
land
the
slaughter
of
the
cannanit
annia
and
saphira
jerusalem
in
ad
etc
if
jesu
stop
the
stone
of
an
adulter
woman
perhap
thi
is
not
a
good
parallel
but
im
go
to
go
with
it
anyway
whi
should
we
not
stop
the
murder
and
violat
of
peopl
who
may
or
may
not
be
more
innoc
we
should
stop
the
slaughter
of
the
innoc
cf
proverb
but
doe
that
mean
that
christian
should
support
a
war
in
bosnia
with
the
u
or
even
the
un
involv
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
am
an
isolationist
and
disagre
with
foreign
adventur
in
gener
but
in
the
case
of
bosnia
i
frankli
see
no
excus
for
u
get
militarili
involv
it
would
not
be
a
just
war
bless
after
all
are
the
peacemak
wa
what
our
lord
said
not
the
interventionist
our
action
in
bosnia
must
be
for
peac
and
not
for
a
war
which
is
unrel
to
anyth
to
justifi
it
