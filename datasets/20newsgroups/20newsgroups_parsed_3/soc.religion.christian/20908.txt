sabbath
admiss
of
i
wrote
in
respons
to
dariuslecoint
it
not
clear
how
much
more
need
to
be
said
other
than
the
faq
i
think
paul
comment
on
esteem
one
day
over
anoth
rom
is
probabl
all
that
need
to
be
said
wa
paul
a
god
too
is
an
interpret
of
the
word
of
paul
of
higher
prioriti
than
the
direct
word
of
jesu
in
matt
paul
begin
roman
with
if
someon
is
weak
in
the
faith
do
you
count
yourself
a
one
who
is
weak
in
the
faith
i
accept
that
dariu
is
do
what
he
doe
in
honor
of
the
lord
i
just
wish
he
might
equal
accept
that
those
who
esteem
all
day
alik
are
similarli
do
their
best
to
honor
the
lord
ye
but
what
doe
the
bibl
have
to
say
what
did
jesu
say
paul
close
roman
with
on
the
other
hand
the
person
with
doubt
about
someth
who
eat
it
anyway
is
guilti
becaus
he
isnt
act
on
hi
faith
and
ani
failur
to
act
on
faith
is
a
sin
gau
isbn
have
you
read
the
ten
command
which
are
a
portion
of
the
law
have
you
read
jesu
word
in
matt
is
there
ani
doubt
in
your
mind
about
what
is
right
and
what
is
sin
greek
hamartia
miss
the
mark
howev
id
like
to
be
clear
that
i
do
not
think
there
unambigu
proof
that
regular
christian
worship
wa
on
the
first
day
a
i
indic
there
are
respons
on
both
of
the
passag
cite
wherea
the
ten
command
and
jesu
word
in
matt
are
fairli
clear
are
they
not
the
difficulti
with
both
of
these
passag
is
that
they
are
actual
about
someth
els
they
both
look
like
they
are
talk
about
nnregular
christian
meet
but
neither
explicitli
say
and
they
gather
everi
sunday
for
worship
we
get
variou
piec
of
inform
but
noth
aim
at
answer
thi
question
matt
doesnt
answer
your
question
what
day
christian
met
in
their
hous
act
despit
dariu
confus
is
describ
by
act
a
occur
on
sunday
it
doesnt
say
they
gather
to
see
paul
off
but
that
when
they
were
gather
for
break
bread
break
bread
roughli
synonym
with
eat
so
i
think
the
most
obviou
read
of
thi
is
that
on
the
first
day
of
everi
week
simpli
mean
everi
time
they
gather
for
worship
how
do
you
unit
thi
concept
of
your
with
the
ten
command
and
jesu
word
in
matt
i
think
the
reason
we
have
onli
implic
and
not
clear
statement
is
that
the
nt
author
assum
that
their
reader
knew
when
christian
worship
wa
clh
or
they
assum
that
the
ten
command
and
jesu
word
in
matt
actual
stood
for
someth
perhap
they
were
strong
in
the
faith
no
i
dont
believ
that
paul
can
overrul
god
howev
paul
wa
write
for
a
larg
gentil
audienc
the
law
wa
regard
by
jew
at
the
time
and
now
a
bind
on
jew
but
not
on
gentil
there
are
rule
that
were
bind
on
all
human
be
the
socal
noachic
law
but
they
are
quit
minim
the
issu
that
the
church
had
to
face
after
jesu
death
wa
what
to
do
about
gentil
who
want
to
follow
christ
the
decis
not
to
impos
the
law
on
them
didnt
say
that
the
law
wa
abolish
it
simpli
acknowledg
that
fact
that
it
didnt
appli
to
gentil
thu
there
is
no
contradict
with
mat
a
far
a
i
can
tell
both
paul
and
other
jewish
christian
did
continu
to
particip
in
jewish
worship
on
the
sabbath
thu
they
continu
to
obey
the
law
the
issu
wa
and
is
with
gentil
christian
who
are
not
cover
by
the
law
or
at
least
not
by
the
ceremoni
aspect
of
it
jesu
dealt
mostli
with
jew
i
think
we
can
reason
assum
that
mat
wa
direct
to
a
jewish
audienc
he
did
interact
with
gentil
a
few
time
eg
the
centurion
whose
slave
wa
heal
and
a
coupl
of
other
the
term
use
to
describ
the
centurion
see
luke
suggest
that
he
wa
a
godfear
ie
a
gentil
who
follow
god
but
had
not
adopt
the
whole
jewish
law
he
wa
commend
by
jewish
elder
a
a
worthi
person
and
jesu
accept
him
a
such
thi
seem
to
me
to
indic
that
jesu
accept
the
prevail
view
that
gentil
need
not
accept
the
law
howev
there
more
involv
if
you
want
to
compar
jesu
and
paul
on
the
law
in
order
to
get
a
full
pictur
of
the
role
of
the
law
we
have
to
come
to
grip
with
paul
appar
reject
of
the
law
and
how
that
relat
to
jesu
commend
of
the
law
at
least
a
i
read
paul
he
say
that
the
law
serf
a
purpos
that
ha
been
in
a
certain
sens
superced
again
thi
issu
isnt
one
of
the
abolit
of
the
law
in
the
middl
of
hi
discuss
paul
note
that
he
might
be
understood
thi
way
and
assur
u
that
that
not
what
he
intend
to
say
rather
he
see
the
law
a
primarili
be
present
to
convict
peopl
of
their
sin
but
ultim
it
an
imposs
standard
and
one
that
ha
been
superced
by
christ
paul
comment
are
not
the
world
clearest
here
and
not
everyon
agre
with
my
read
but
the
interest
thing
to
notic
is
that
even
thi
radic
posit
doe
not
entail
an
abolit
of
the
law
it
still
remain
a
an
uncompromis
standard
from
which
not
an
iota
or
dot
may
be
remov
for
it
purpos
of
convict
of
sin
it
import
that
it
not
be
relax
howev
for
christian
it
not
the
end
ultim
we
live
in
faith
not
law
while
the
theoret
categori
they
use
are
rather
differ
in
the
end
i
think
jesu
and
paul
come
to
a
rather
similar
conclus
the
quot
passag
from
mat
should
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
where
jesu
show
u
how
he
interpret
the
law
the
not
an
iota
or
dot
would
suggest
a
rather
liter
read
but
in
fact
that
not
jesu
approach
jesu
interpret
emphas
the
intent
of
the
law
and
stay
away
from
the
ceremoni
detail
inde
he
is
well
known
for
take
a
rather
free
attitud
toward
the
sabbath
and
kosher
law
some
scholar
claim
that
mat
need
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
st
cent
jewish
discuss
jesu
accus
hi
oppon
of
care
about
give
a
tenth
of
even
the
most
minor
herb
but
neglect
the
thing
that
realli
matter
justic
merci
and
faith
and
care
about
how
cup
and
plate
are
clean
but
not
about
the
fact
that
insid
the
peopl
who
use
them
are
full
of
extort
and
rapac
mat
thi
and
the
discuss
later
in
mat
suggest
that
jesu
ha
a
veri
specif
view
of
the
law
in
mind
and
that
when
he
talk
about
maintain
the
law
in
it
full
strength
he
is
think
of
these
aspect
of
it
paul
conclus
is
similar
while
he
talk
about
the
law
be
superced
all
of
the
specif
exampl
he
give
involv
the
ceremoni
law
such
a
circumcis
and
the
sabbath
he
is
quit
concern
about
maintain
moral
standard
the
net
result
of
thi
is
that
when
paul
talk
about
the
law
be
superced
and
jesu
talk
about
the
law
be
maintain
i
believ
they
are
talk
about
differ
aspect
of
the
law
paul
is
embroil
in
argument
about
circumcis
a
is
natur
in
letter
respond
to
specif
situat
he
look
at
the
aspect
of
the
law
that
is
current
caus
troubl
the
law
a
specif
jewish
ceremoni
he
certainli
doe
not
intend
to
abolish
divin
standard
of
conduct
on
the
other
hand
when
jesu
commend
the
law
he
seem
to
be
talk
the
law
in
it
broadest
implic
for
moral
and
human
relationship
and
deemphas
those
aspect
that
were
later
to
give
paul
so
much
troubl
it
unfortun
that
peopl
use
the
same
term
in
differ
way
but
we
should
be
familiar
with
that
from
current
conflict
look
at
the
way
term
like
famili
valu
take
on
special
mean
from
the
current
context
imagin
some
poor
historian
of
the
futur
tri
to
figur
out
whi
famili
valu
should
be
use
a
a
code
word
for
opposit
to
homosexu
in
one
specif
period
in
the
u
i
think
law
had
taken
on
a
similar
role
in
the
argument
paul
wa
involv
in
paul
wa
clearli
not
reject
all
of
the
jewish
valu
that
go
along
with
the
term
law
ani
more
than
peopl
who
concern
about
the
famili
valu
movement
are
realli
oppos
to
famili
