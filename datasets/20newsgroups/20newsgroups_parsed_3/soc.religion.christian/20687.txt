write
for
exampl
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
at
all
whether
there
is
a
whi
or
not
we
have
to
find
it
thi
is
pascal
wager
if
there
is
no
whi
and
we
spend
our
life
search
then
we
have
mere
wast
our
life
which
were
meaningless
anyway
if
there
is
a
whi
and
we
i
find
thi
view
of
christian
to
be
quit
dishearten
and
sad
the
idea
that
life
onli
ha
mean
or
import
if
there
is
a
creator
doe
not
seem
like
much
of
a
basi
for
belief
pleas
forgiv
all
the
inclus
i
suppos
they
are
neccessari
to
follow
the
argument
my
point
is
that
if
life
ha
mean
or
import
then
we
should
tri
to
find
that
mean
or
import
which
is
almost
a
tautolog
i
hope
im
not
be
too
patron
one
term
for
that
mean
is
creator
though
that
is
not
obviou
from
my
abov
argument
and
the
logic
is
also
appal
god
must
exist
becaus
i
want
him
to
it
more
like
i
think
therefor
i
am
therefor
god
is
i
have
heard
thi
line
of
reason
befor
and
wonder
how
preval
it
is
certainli
in
modern
societi
mani
peopl
are
convinc
life
is
hopeless
or
so
the
pollster
and
newscast
state
but
i
dont
see
where
thi
is
a
good
reason
to
becom
religi
if
you
want
mean
whi
not
just
join
a
cult
such
a
in
waco
the
leader
will
give
you
the
secur
blanket
you
desir
unfortun
the
term
religi
is
ambigu
to
me
in
thi
context
i
could
say
that
search
for
mean
in
life
is
by
definit
be
religi
i
could
say
cult
follow
by
definit
have
given
up
on
the
search
if
you
want
mean
whi
not
search
for
the
truth
so
far
my
understand
of
christian
is
congruent
with
my
understand
of
truth
there
have
been
mani
befor
me
who
have
come
to
conclus
that
are
word
in
way
that
make
sens
to
me
by
no
mean
doe
that
impli
that
i
