re
the
doctrin
of
origin
sin
if
babi
are
not
suppos
to
be
baptis
then
whi
doesnt
the
bibl
ever
say
so
it
never
come
right
and
say
onli
peopl
that
know
right
from
wrong
or
who
are
taught
can
be
baptis
thi
is
not
a
veri
sound
argument
for
baptis
babi
it
assum
that
if
the
bibl
doesnt
say
specif
that
you
dont
need
to
do
someth
then
that
must
mean
that
you
do
need
to
do
it
i
know
there
a
specif
term
for
thi
form
of
logic
but
it
escap
me
right
now
howev
if
it
were
sound
then
you
should
be
abl
to
appli
it
thi
way
if
the
bibl
doesnt
specif
say
that
someth
is
wrong
then
it
must
be
ok
which
coincident
lead
perfectli
into
a
question
ive
often
ponder
if
slaveri
is
immor
which
i
believ
it
is
can
i
assum
that
everyon
el
in
thi
group
doe
too
whi
doesnt
jesu
or
ani
of
the
apostl
speak
out
against
it
own
slave
wa
common
practic
back
then
paul
speak
about
everyth
el
that
is
immor
he
appar
thought
it
wa
import
enough
to
talk
about
thing
like
not
be
a
drunkard
whi
doesnt
anyon
mention
slaveri
if
god
moral
are
etern
and
dont
chang
like
the
moral
of
societi
then
it
must
have
been
just
a
immor
then
a
it
is
today
