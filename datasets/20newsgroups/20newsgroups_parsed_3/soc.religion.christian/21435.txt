re
whi
do
peopl
becom
atheist
in
articl
write
christian
can
also
feel
that
sens
of
differ
howev
when
they
are
associ
with
those
weird
televangelist
who
alway
talk
about
satan
if
youll
excus
the
clich
sound
of
thi
everyon
ha
to
deal
with
hi
her
differ
from
other
peopl
i
can
understand
how
be
an
atheist
could
be
hard
for
you
be
a
christian
is
sometim
hard
for
me
thi
is
not
at
all
compar
christian
is
the
main
stream
in
western
cultur
you
are
trivial
the
experi
of
other
i
rememb
what
it
wa
like
be
differ
a
a
christian
we
were
told
all
the
time
that
we
were
differ
and
in
fact
that
onli
member
of
the
our
church
were
realli
christian
though
other
who
believ
in
god
werent
a
bad
a
atheist
so
we
were
a
small
minor
that
wa
noth
compar
to
be
an
atheist
the
onli
thing
compar
would
be
a
young
child
be
christian
be
surround
by
staunch
atheist
includ
parent
who
activ
persecut
ani
religi
tendanc
both
actual
punish
and
even
wors
emot
blackmail
they
would
also
have
to
have
the
whole
mainstream
societi
on
their
side
mayb
these
condit
could
have
occur
in
the
old
soviet
union
not
in
a
countri
with
under
god
in
it
pledg
of
allegi
i
doubt
it
even
then
becaus
child
have
to
be
taught
to
be
christian
and
henc
must
have
support
somewher
i
have
sympathi
for
gay

up
in
repress
environ
and
have
to
hide
and
sometim
at
first
tri
to
deni
a
part
of
themselv
becaus
ive
been
there
onli
in
my
case
it
wa
my
ration
instead
of
sexual
which
i
wa
forc
to
tri
to
repress
in
some
way
the
pressur
were
differ
of
cours
becaus
you
chose
your
belief
or
are
you
say
that
they
were
not
your
choic
but
born
of
necess
pleas
no
flame
about
whether
or
not
gay
peopl
choos
their
lifestyl
that

mostli
a

have
noth
to
do
with
it
i
could
choos
to
lie
or
to
be
silent
about
my
true
belief
i
could
no
more
choos
to
believ
in
the
god
of
christian
than
i
could
decid
that
the
ordinari
sky
look
red
to
me
still
i
should
be
clear
that
im
not
equat
what
i
went
through
with
what
gay
go
through
howev
it
is
a
mistak
to
assum
that
everyon
