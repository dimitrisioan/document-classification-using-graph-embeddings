subject
re
what
did
lazaru
smell
like
in
articl
tim
rolf
write
my
guess
is
that
the
lazaru
come
out
wa
also
for
the
sake
of
the
crowd
i
read
somewher
i
think
in
morton
smith
jesu
the
magician
that
old
lazaru
wasnt
dead
but
go
in
the
tomb
wa
part
of
an
initi
rite
for
a
magicult
of
which
jesu
wa
also
a
part
it
appear
that
a
day
stay
wa
normal
i
wonder
i
havent
read
that
book
but
anoth
one
by
smith
in
which
similar
claim
were
made
about
jesu
while
im
sure
smith
know
more
about
earli
chrisitan
than
i
do
i
found
hi
argument
similar
to
those
of
book
like
holi
blood
holi
grail
build
conjectur
on
top
of
other
conjectur
there
wa
no
direct
evid
if
youd
like
to
summar
the
argument
for
u
id
be
happi
to
see
it
but
in
do
so
id
like
you
to
pay
care
attent
to
the
natur
of
the
evid
