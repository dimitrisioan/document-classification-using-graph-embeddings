murray
write
i
would
like
the
opinion
of
netter
on
a
subject
that
ha
been
bother
my
wife
and
me
late
liturgi
in
particular
cathol
liturgi
in
the
last
fe
year
it
seem
that
there
are
more
and
more
ad
hoc
event
dure
mass
it
drive
me
crazi
the
most
gracefil
aspect
of
a
liturg
tradit
is
that
what
happen
is
someth
we
all
do
togeth
becaus
we
all
know
how
do
it
led
by
the
priest
of
cours
which
make
it
a
kind
of
dialogu
we
present
to
god
but
the
best
mass
ive
been
to
were
participatori
prayer
on
the
one
hand
there
are
advantag
to
have
the
liturgi
stay
the
same
john
ha
describ
some
of
these
on
the
other
hand
some
peopl
seem
to
start
tune
out
the
same
old
word
and
pay
attent
better
when
thing
get
chang
around
i
think
innov
priest
and
liturgi
committe
are
tri
to
get
our
attent
and
make
thing
more
meaning
for
u
it
drive
me
crazi
too
differ
peopl
have
differ
prefer
and
need
in
liturgi
my
local
parish
is
innov
i
prefer
to
go
to
mass
at
the
next
parish
over
sometim
we
dont
have
the
option
of
attend
a
mass
in
the
style
which
best
suit
u
john
put
a
smiley
on
it
but
to
just
offer
it
up
probabl
is
the
solut
a
relat
issu
that
it
sound
like
john
doe
not
have
to
deal
with
is
that
spous
may
have
differ
liturg
tast
my
husband
doe
like
innov
lituri
it
is
a
challeng
to
meet
both
of
our
spiritu
need
without
just
go
our
separ
way
when
you
includ
the
factor
of
also
tri
to
satisfi
our
child
need
thing
get
pretti
complic
one
thing
to
rememb
is
that
even
the
most
uncongeni
mass
is
still
mass
