if
you
are
use
the
standard
formula
of
fulli
god
and
fulli
human
that
im
not
sure
whi
you
object
to
say
that
jesu
wa
human
i
think
the
usual
analysi
would
be
that
sin
is
not
part
of
the
basic
definit
of
human
it
a
consequ
of
the
fall
jesu
is
human
but
not
a
fallen
human
clh
the
proper
term
for
what
mike
express
is
monophysit
thi
wa
a
heresi
that
wa
condemn
in
the
council
of
chalcedon
in
ad
it
grew
up
in
reaction
to
nestorian
which
held
that
the
son
and
jesu
are
two
differ
peopl
who
happen
to
be
unit
in
the
same
bodi
temporarili
monophysit
is
held
by
the
copt
of
egypt
and
ethipoia
and
by
the
jacobit
of
syria
and
the
armenian
orthodox
it
believ
that
jesu
christ
wa
god
which
is
correct
that
he
wa
man
which
is
correct
that
he
wa
one
person
which
is
correct
but
that
he
had
onli
one
natur
and
one
will
and
oen
energi
which
is
heret
the
orthodox
posit
is
that
he
had
two
natur
and
two
will
and
two
energi
both
divin
and
human
though
the
will
were
in
perfect
harmoni
that
is
what
mike
is
tri
to
get
across
that
while
jesu
came
in
human
form
mike
say
he
did
not
have
a
human
natur
or
a
human
will
in
realiti
he
had
both
though
neither
made
him
subject
to
origin
sin
it
is
interest
to
note
that
the
monothelit
were
a
reaction
to
thi
conflict
and
attempt
to
solv
the
problem
by
admit
two
natur
but
not
two
will
or
two
energi
it
also
wa
condemn
at
a
late
council
in
constantinopl
i
believ
andi
byler
these
issu
get
mighti
subtl
when
you
see
peopl
say
differ
thing
it
often
hard
to
tell
whether
they
realli
mean
serious
differ
thing
or
whether
they
are
use
differ
terminolog
i
dont
think
there
ani
question
that
there
is
a
problem
with
nestoriu
and
i
would
agre
that
the
say
christ
had
a
human
form
without
a
real
human
natur
or
will
is
heret
but
id
like
to
be
a
bit
wari
about
the
copt
armenian
etc
recent
discus
suggest
that
their
monophysit
posit
may
not
be
a
far
from
orthodoxi
a
mani
had
thought
nestoriu
wa
an
extrem
repres
of
one
of
the
two
major
school
of
thought
more
moder
repres
were
regard
a
orthodox
eg
theodor
of
mopsuestia
my
impress
is
that
the
modern
monophysit
group
inherit
the
entir
tradit
not
just
nestoriu
version
and
that
some
of
them
may
have
a
suffici
balanc
posit
to
be
regard
a
orthodox
