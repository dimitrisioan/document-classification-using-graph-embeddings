my
last
feebl
breath
will
utter
your
name
my
he
say
oh
that
that
wa
just
rhetor
just
poetri
when
a
man
is
in
a
romant
mood
he
is
bound
to
say
all
kind
of
silli
thing
like
that
you
mustnt
take
them
liter
and
that
is
whi
you
have
an
insist
on
a
formal
ceremoni
that
is
a
matter
of
public
record
the
church
insist
on
it
becaus
it
is
her
duti
among
other
thing
to
give
moral
advic
and
you
can
not
give
a
man
moral
advic
about
hi
relat
with
a
woman
if
you
have
no
idea
who
is
marri
to
whom
if
anybodi
and
vice
versa
the
state
insist
on
it
sinc
the
state
ha
a
concern
with
properti
right
with
child
care
and
support
and
therefor
need
to
know
who
ha
made
what
commit
to
whom
prospect
fathersinlaw
insist
on
it
becaus
they
dont
want
their
daughter
seduc
and
abandon
prospect
spous
insist
on
it
becaus
they
want
to
make
sure
they
know
whether
what
they
are
hear
is
a
real
commit
or
just
poetri
and
person
make
vow
themselv
insist
on
make
them
formal
and
publicli
in
order
that
they
may
be
clear
in
their
own
mind
about
what
it
is
that
they
are
do
and
may
know
themselv
that
thi
is
not
just
rhetor
thi
is
the
real
thing
henc
the
insist
on
a
formal
public
explicit
avow
of
the
marriag
commit
the
church
goe
further
and
insist
that
when
christian
marri
a
clergyman
shall
be
present
at
the
wed
and
record
the
vow
on
behalf
of
the
church
not
becaus
it
is
imposs
to
have
a
valid
wed
without
a
clergyman
but
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
coupl
understand
what
the
christian
teach
about
marriag
is
and
that
they
are
in
fact
promis
to
be
marri
in
a
christian
sen
the
church
also
prefer
a
standard
marriag
vow
and
is
wari
of
let
coupl
write
their
own
vow
for
much
the
same
reason
that
lawyer
prefer
standard
terminolog
when
they
draw
up
a
will
or
a
contract
certain
languag
ha
been
repeatedli
use
in
will
and
one
can
be
sure
how
the
court
will
interpret
it
tri
to
say
the
same
thing
in
your
own
word
and
you
may
find
that
the
probat
judg
interpret
of
them
is
not
at
all
what
you
intend
similarli
the
church
prefer
to
avoid
endless
debat
about
whether
you
are
my
main
squeez
and
i
am
here
for
the
long
haul
do
in
fact
cover
the
same
territori
a
forsak
all
other
and
till
death
do
u
part
thi
topic
ha
come
up
on
the
list
befor
is
there
ani
topic
that
hasnt
one
listmemb
wa
ask
if
a
coupl
love
each
other
and
are
live
togeth
isnt
that
marriag
in
the
eye
of
god
eventu
someon
ask
in
that
case
what
is
their
statu
if
they
break
up
is
that
the
moral
equival
of
get
a
divorc
are
they
in
a
relationship
that
god
forbid
either
of
them
to
walk
out
on
the
origin
question
said
good
grief
i
never
thought
of
that
in
fact
there
are
reason
ground
for
suspect
that
someon
who
say
we
dont
need
a
piec
of
paper
or
a
ceremoni
in
front
of
a
judg
or
a
preacher
in
order
to
show
that
we
love
each
other
is
tri
to
have
it
both
way
to
have
the
advantag
of
marriag
plu
the
option
of
chang
hi
mind
with
a
minimum
of
bother
at
thi
point
someon
may
say
none
of
thi
appli
to
me
and
my
mate
we
are
quit
clear
on
the
fact
that
we
have
assum
a
lifelong
commit
for
better
or
wors
forsak
all
other
till
death
u
do
part
so
in
our
case
no
ceremoni
is
need
to
thi
my
repli
would
be
the
reason
for
requir
a
driver
licens
is
to
keep
danger
driver
off
the
road
what
is
wrong
in
itself
is
not
the
exist
of
unlicens
driver
but
the
exist
of
danger
driver
howev
test
and
licens
driver
is
an
obviou
and
reason
mean
of
pursu
the
goal
of
reduc
the
number
of
danger
driver
on
the
road
therefor
the
state
rightli
make
and
enforc
such
law
and
you
the
citizen
have
a
posit
moral
oblig
to
refrain
from
drive
without
a
licens
no
matter
how
much
of
a
hotshot
behind
the
wheel
you
think
you
are
back
to
the
origin
question
we
have
a
listmemb
who
know
a
coupl
who
have
been
live
togeth
for
around
year
he
ask
at
what
point
did
they
stop
fornic
and
start
be
marri
i
answer
at
the
point
if
ani
where
they
both
definit
and
explicitli
accept
an
oblig
to
be
faith
to
each
other
for
better
or
wors
a
long
a
they
both
live
if
they
have
accept
such
an
oblig
what
are
their
reason
for
not
be
will
to
declar
it
in
front
of
say
a
justic
of
the
peac
