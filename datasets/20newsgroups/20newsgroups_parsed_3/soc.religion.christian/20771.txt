re
the
arrog
of
christian
in
articl
carol
alvin
write
virgilio
dean
b
velasco
jr
write
hold
it
i
said
that
all
of
scriptur
is
true
howev
discern
exactli
what
jesu
paul
and
compani
were
tri
to
say
is
not
alway
so
easi
i
dont
believ
that
paul
wa
tri
to
say
that
all
woman
should
behav
that
way
rather
he
wa
tri
to
say
that
under
the
circumst
at
the
time
the
woman
he
wa
speak
to
would
best
avoid
volubl
and
cover
their
head
thi
ha
to
do
with
maintain
a
proper
wit
toward
other
rememb
that
ani
number
of
relativist
statement
can
be
deriv
from
absolut
for
instanc
it
is
absolut
right
for
christian
to
strive
for
peac
howev
thi
doe
not
rule
out
tri
to
maintain
world
peac
by
resort
to
violenc
on
occas
ye
my
opinion
i
agre
that
there
is
truth
in
scriptur
there
are
principl
to
be
learn
from
it
claim
that
that
truth
is
absolut
though
seem
to
impli
a
liter
read
of
the
bibl
if
it
were
absolut
truth
constant
across
time
cultur
etc
then
no
interpret
would
be
necessari
i
strongli
disagre
that
absolut
truth
would
not
requir
interpret
that
becaus
truth
may
be
absolut
but
it
may
not
be
obviou
like
so
mani
thing
the
truth
is
alway
subject
to
misinterpret
i
strongli
suspect
that
we
are
reach
an
impass
here
which
is
whi
i
deign
from
comment
much
further
sure
the
bibl
preach
absolut
truth
howev
exactli
what
those
truth
are
is
sometim
a
matter
of
confus
a
i
said
the
bibl
doe
preach
absolut
truth
sometim
those
fundament
principl
are
crystal
clear
at
least
to
evangel
thi
is
where
the
arrog
come
in
to
play
sinc
these
principl
are
crystal
clear
to
evangel
mayb
the
rest
of
u
should
just
take
their
word
for
it
mayb
it
isnt
at
all
crystal
clear
to
me
that
their
fundament
principl
are
either
fundament
or
principl
now
hold
it
i
never
said
that
christian
can
not
be
arrog
inde
a
mani
other
christian
on
src
have
stress
befor
thi
is
a
trap
that
christian
must
alway
be
wari
about
howev
thi
doe
not
mean
that
if
you
believ
in
the
absolut
establish
by
the
bibl
you
are
necessarili
be
arrog
a
christian
can
believ
that
the
word
of
god
is
absolut
but
he
or
she
should
not
expect
thi
to
be
immedi
evid
to
everyon
so
i
think
that
your
posit
is
the
bibl
is
absolut
truth
but
a
we
are
prone
to
error
in
our
interpret
we
can
not
reliabl
determin
if
we
have
figur
out
what
that
truth
is
did
i
get
that
right
not
quit
you
say
that
accord
to
my
stanc
we
can
not
reliabl
determin
what
is
true
that
is
not
what
i
said
i
say
that
a
fallibl
human
be
we
can
not
discern
the
truth
with
certainti
the
distinct
is
subtl
yet
import
when
a
scientist
perform
an
experi
he
can
claim
that
hi
result
are
reliabl
without
claim
that
absolut
no
mistak
whatsoev
could
have
been
made
in
other
word
he
can
admit
that
he
could
be
mistaken
without
sacrif
hi
convict
nobodi
can
establish
what
absolut
truth
is
with
certainti
throughout
the
centuri
philosoph
have
argu
about
what
we
can
know
with
complet
certainti
and
what
we
can
not
descart
made
a
step
in
the
right
direct
when
he
utter
cogito
ergo
sum
yet
we
have
not
advanc
much
beyond
that
do
you
believ
that
other
peopl
asid
from
you
exist
do
you
believ
that
the
comput
termin
you
are
use
exist
if
so
can
you
be
absolut
certain
about
that
are
you
sure
it
is
not
some
grand
illus
of
cours
you
have
no
such
assur
thi
doe
not
mean
howev
that
for
all
practic
purpos
you
can
be
certain
that
they
exist
so
it
is
with
christian
the
most
matur
christian
i
know
have
deep
convict
about
absolut
moral
yet
they
acknowledg
that
there
is
a
nonzero
probabl
that
they
are
wrong
thi
doe
not
howev
mean
that
they
should
or
do
abandon
these
absolut
what
the
point
of
spend
all
thi
time
claim
and
defend
absolut
truth
when
we
can
never
know
what
those
truth
are
and
we
can
never
or
at
least
shouldnt
act
upon
them
what
practic
differ
can
thi
make
a
i
said
we
can
never
be
absolut
certain
that
we
are
correct
thi
doe
not
mean
that
we
can
not
be
certain
enough
in
light
of
the
