write
in
articl
carol
alvin
write
are
all
truth
also
absolut
is
all
of
scriptur
truth
and
therefor
absolut
if
the
answer
to
either
of
these
question
is
no
then
perhap
you
can
explain
to
me
how
you
determin
which
part
of
scriptur
are
truth
and
which
truth
are
absolut
the
answer
to
both
question
is
ye
perhap
we
have
differ
definit
of
absolut
then
to
me
an
absolut
is
someth
that
is
constant
across
time
cultur
situat
etc
true
in
everi
instanc
possibl
do
you
agre
with
thi
definit
i
think
you
do
similarli
all
truth
is
absolut
inde
a
nonabsolut
truth
is
a
contradict
in
term
when
is
someth
absolut
when
it
is
alway
true
obvious
if
a
truth
is
not
alway
true
then
we
have
a
contradict
in
term
ye
i
do
agre
with
your
definit
my
use
of
the
term
alway
is
rather
decept
i
admit
a
simpl
exampl
in
the
new
testament
sorri
i
dont
have
a
bibl
at
work
and
cant
provid
a
refer
woman
are
instruct
to
be
silent
and
cover
their
head
in
church
now
thi
is
scriptur
by
your
definit
thi
is
truth
and
therefor
absolut
hold
it
i
said
that
all
of
scriptur
is
true
howev
discern
exactli
what
jesu
paul
and
compani
were
tri
to
say
is
not
alway
so
easi
i
dont
believ
that
paul
wa
tri
to
say
that
all
woman
should
behav
that
way
rather
he
wa
tri
to
say
that
under
the
circumst
at
the
time
the
woman
he
wa
speak
to
would
best
avoid
volubl
and
cover
their
head
thi
ha
to
do
with
maintain
a
proper
wit
toward
other
rememb
that
ani
number
of
relativist
statement
can
be
deriv
from
absolut
for
instanc
it
is
absolut
right
for
christian
to
strive
for
peac
howev
thi
doe
not
rule
out
tri
to
maintain
world
peac
by
resort
to
violenc
on
occas
ye
my
opinion
evangel
are
clearli
not
take
thi
particular
part
of
scriptur
to
be
absolut
truth
and
there
are
plenti
of
other
exampl
can
you
reconcil
thi
sure
the
bibl
preach
absolut
truth
howev
exactli
what
those
truth
are
is
sometim
a
matter
of
confus
a
i
said
the
bibl
doe
preach
absolut
truth
sometim
those
fundament
principl
are
crystal
clear
at
least
to
evangel
sometim
they
are
not
so
clear
to
everyon
eg
should
baptism
be
by
full
immers
or
not
etc
that
is
larg
becaus
sometim
it
is
not
explicitli
spell
out
whether
the
writer
are
speak
to
a
particular
cultur
or
to
christian
a
a
whole
thi
is
where
scholarship
and
the
studi
of
biblic
context
come
in
it
veri
difficult
to
see
how
you
can
claim
someth
which
is
base
on
your
own
interpret
is
absolut
god
reveal
hi
truth
to
the
world
through
hi
word
it
is
utterli
unavoid
howev
that
some
peopl
whill
come
up
with
altern
interpret
practic
anyth
can
be
misinterpret
especi
when
it
come
to
