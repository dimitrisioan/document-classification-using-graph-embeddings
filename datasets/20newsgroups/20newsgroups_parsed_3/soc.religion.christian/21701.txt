hyslop
and

in
articl
charley
wingat
write
see
a
how
thetwobabylon
ha
been
brought
up
again
it
is
time
for
me
to
respond
onc
again
and
say
that
thi
book
is
junk
it
is
noth
more
that
an
anticathol
tract
of
the
sort
publish
ever
sinc
the
there
were
protest
it
scholarship
is
phoni
and
it
assert
spuriou
i
have
not
seen
thi
book
though
i
have
had
sever
peopl
quot
it
in
support
of
some
tendenti
assert
they
were
make
so
i
have
becom
curiou
about
it
i
dont
want
to
malign
thi
hislop
fellow
whoever
he
may
be
a
i
have
onli
heard
the
argument
at
second
hand
but
both
of
the
argument
seem
to
turn
on
fals
etymolog
that
seem
to
be
deriv
from
hislop
i
would
be
interest
in
know
more
about
these
thing
the
first
one
claim
that
the
word
church
wa
deriv
from
the
greek
cyclo
and
that
it
wa
therefor
relat
to
the
worship
of
circ
i
dont
know
if
hislop
is
the
sourc
of
thi
assert
but
it
doe
seem
to
be
base
on
fals
etymolog
the
second
claim
an
etymolog
relationship
between
ishtar
and
easter
which
seem
to
be
even
more
fanci
and
farfetch
than
some
of
the
wilder
notion
of
the
british
israelit
regard
the
latter
a
far
a
i
have
been
abl
to
find
out
easter
is
deriv
from
the
old
english
name
for
april
eosturmonath
the
vener
bede
mention
that
thi
wa
associ
with
a
goddess
call
eostr
but
apart
from
that
refer
i
have
not
been
abl
to
find
out
anyth
more
about
her
it
also
seem
that
the
term
easter
is
onli
use
by
the
english
and
those
they
evangel
the
german
for
exampl
also
use
the
term
ostern
but
germani
wa
evangel
by
english
missionari
so
i
would
be
interest
in
ani
evid
of
easter
be
use
for
pascha
by
peopl
who
do
not
have
ani
kind
of
connect
with
the
ancient
anglo
saxon
and
their
offshoot
such
evid
might
support
the
claim
of
those
who
appear
to
deriv
the
theori
from
