re
the
arrog
of
christian
in
articl
carol
alvin
write
virgilio
dean
b
velasco
jr
write
no
imo
mr
stowel
miss
the
point
we
affirm
the
absolut
of
scriptur
not
becaus
we
are
arrog
moralist
but
becaus
we
believ
in
god
who
is
truth
who
ha
reveal
hi
truth
in
hi
word
and
therefor
we
hold
a
preciou
the
strateg
import
of
those
absolut
mr
stowel
seem
to
have
jump
rather
strang
from
truth
to
absolut
i
dont
see
how
that
necessarili
follow
are
all
truth
also
absolut
is
all
of
scriptur
truth
and
therefor
absolut
if
the
answer
to
either
of
these
question
is
no
then
perhap
you
can
explain
to
me
how
you
determin
which
part
of
scriptur
are
truth
and
which
truth
are
absolut
the
answer
to
both
question
is
ye
all
scriptur
is
true
be
inspir
by
god
the
evid
for
thi
claim
ha
been
discus
ad
nauseum
in
thi
group
similarli
all
truth
is
absolut
inde
a
nonabsolut
truth
is
a
contradict
in
term
when
is
someth
absolut
when
it
is
alway
true
obvious
if
a
truth
is
not
alway
true
then
we
have
a
contradict
in
term
mani
peopl
claim
that
there
are
no
absolut
in
the
world
such
a
statement
is
terribl
selfcontradictori
let
me
put
it
to
you
thi
way
if
there
are
no
absolut
shouldnt
we
conclud
that
the
statement
there
are
no
absolut
is
not
absolut
true
obvious
we
have
a
contradict
here
thi
is
just
one
of
the
reason
whi
christian
defi
the
world
by
claim
that
there
are
inde
absolut
in
the
univers
there
is
hardli
consensu
even
in
evangel
christian
not
to
mention
the
rest
of
christian
regard
biblic
interpret
so
peopl
sometim
disagre
about
what
is
true
thi
doe
not
negat
the
fact
howev
that
there
are
still
absolut
in
the
univers
moreov
evangel
christian
at
least
still
profess
to
believ
in
certain
truth
man
is
sin
man
need
salvat
and
jesu
is
the
propiti
for
mankind
sin
to
name
a
few
ani
group
that
doe
not
profess
to
believ
these
statement
