therein
wa
unquestion
there
is
much
to
griev
randi
veri
interest
but
i
also
believ
that
you
have
present
a
mislead
argument
christian
is
not
the
caus
of
the
massacr
and
horrif
injustic
that
you
relat
rather
they
are
the
fault
of
peopl
who
misunderstand
jesu
christ
messag
and
modifi
it
to
suit
their
own
belief
and
aim
rather
than
alter
their
ambit
to
be
more
in
line
with
those
present
a
desir
in
the
new
testament
with
everi
truth
and
good
messag
that
carri
author
or
impli
author
come
the
inevit
fact
that
some
mani
peopl
will
understand
it
in
a
distort
way
with
inevit
consequ
the
bibl
messag
is
that
we
are
to
love
all
peopl
and
that
all
peopl
are
redeem
it
preach
a
messag
of
repent
and
of
give
unfortun
all
peopl
have
deceit
heart
and
are
capabl
of
turn
thi
messag
around
and
contort
it
in
sometim
unbeliev
way
thi
is
also
a
fundament
christian
doctrin
one
of
the
problem
is
that
you
look
at
the
world
through
the
eye
of
western
histori
i
think
that
you
will
find
mani
mani
case
of
massacr
that
were
instig
by
peopl
who
never
claim
they
were
christian
i
am
not
say
thi
to
justifi
the
massacr
that
were
but
i
am
mere
point
you
to
a
tendenc
which
is
present
in
human
alreadi
consid
the
world
without
christian
i
doubt
that
we
would
have
the
same
freedom
in
the
countri
in
which
we
live
if
it
wasnt
for
the
peac
doctrin
of
jesu
christ
perhap
we
would
even
be
confront
by
a
veri
harsh
religion
i
wont
name
ani
here
though
one
come
to
mind
which
would
not
even
allow
u
the
freedom
of
speech
to
debat
such
subject
point
the
blame
at
inher
human
tendenc
of
thirst
for
power
greed
and
hatr
plea
dont
point
the
blame
at
a
messag
which
preach
fundament
give
and
denial
in
love
for

p
i
believ
that
a
line
of
question
like
you
present
is
strang
enough
compat
with
becom

christian
encourag
one
to
question
the
behaviour
of
the

and
especi
christian
i
prais

for

the
fact
that
