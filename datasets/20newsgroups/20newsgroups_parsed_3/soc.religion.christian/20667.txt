jimt
ii
write
good
that
is
within
the
power
of
each
of
u
now
the
complic
is
that
one
of
my
best
friend
ha
becom
veri
fundamentalist
that
would
normal
be
a
nonissu
with
me
but
he
hello
firstli
what
do
you
exactli
mean
by
fundamentalist
i
will
for
the
time
be
assum
that
what
you
mean
is
that
your
friend
belief
that
the
bibl
is
god
word
to
mankind
i
suspect
that
what
happen
to
him
is
what
hell
call
be
born
again
anyway
wa
that
recent
if
the
answer
is
ye
to
all
the
question
abov
it
is
quit
understand
howev
imo
ild
rather
give
advic
to
your
friend
i
think
ive
been
through
someth
similar
to
him
and
one
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
basic
problem
is
that
each
of
you
are
now
tri
to
commun
from
differ
worldview
whi
he
talk
about
those
thing
is
becaus
they
are
now
obviou
to
him
what
is
obviou
to
him
is
not
obviou
to
you
secondli
whi
he
may
be
veri
persuas
is
becaus
from
hi
point
of
view
he
ha
been
on
both
side
of
the
fenc
thi
i
mean
that
befor
he
turn
fundamentalist
you
two
are
agreeabl
becaus
both
of
you
see
thing
from
the
same
side
if
suddenli
a
if
a
new
world
of
realiti
ha
suddenli
open
up
to
him
it
is
like
the
discoveri
of
let
say
a
new
contin
or
a
new
planet
to
him
he
got
to
tell
you
becaus
he
ha
seen
someth
much
more
wonder
than
where
he
wa
and
what
he
think
is
much
better
than
where
you
are
now
you
have
got
to
realis
that
from
hi
point
of
view
he
mean
well
to
you
eventhough
he
may
end
up
offend
you
to
him
it
is
worth
that
risk
nevertheless
it
is
realli
up
to
him
to
respect
where
you
stand
and
listen
to
you
a
well
at
thi
moment
it
may
be
difficult
becaus
he
is
either
veri
excit
or
feel
it
is
too
urgent
to
keep
quiet
about
howev
he
may
not
realis
that
he
realli
put
you
off
the
bibl
that
it
is
so
so
my
question
is
how
can
i
convinc
him
that
thi
is
a
subject
better
left
undiscuss
so
we
can
preserv
what
is
in
all
area
other
than
religi
belief
a
great
friendship
how
do
i
convinc
him
that
i
am
beyond
save
so
he
wont
tri
thank
for
ani
advic
so
far
ive
onli
been
tri
to
explain
thing
from
hi
side
howev
i
do
understand
how
you
feel
too
becaus
i
wasnt
a
christian
for
a
good
part
of
my
life
a
well
i
wa
quit
turn
off
by
christian
or
fundamentalist
who
were
realli
all
out
and
enthusiast
about
their
faith
they
realli
scare
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
unfortun
religi
belief
is
a
veri
person
thing
just
a
your
agnostic
is
also
a
veri
person
thing
to
you
sinc
the
christian
belief
is
inevit
at
odd
with
anyth
nonchristian
religi
or
otherwis
it
will
be
a
touchi
matter
like
all
friendship
it
will
take
both
side
to
do
their
part
to
make
it
work
in
thi
matter
mayb
you
can
do
your
part
by
tell
him
nice
that
you
are
not
abl
to
dig
what
he
tri
to
convinc
you
about
that
it
beyond
you
or
not
your
concern
for
now
dont
tell
him
it
nonsens
becaus
to
him
it
is
realiti
and
that
would
be
a
real
insult
hell
also
have
to
be
care
not
to
insult
where
you
stand
too
like
i
said
befor
i
wish
i
could
give
your
friend
some
advic
too
ill
admit
that
i
did
similarli
to
some
of
my
friend
when
i
becam
a
christian
in
some
way
i
wish
i
could
have
done
thing
a
littl
differ
howev
it
wa
difficult
then
becaus
i
wa
so
excit
and
just
blabber
away
about
what
ive
found
to
me
it
wa
too
good
not
to
know
to
some
i
wa
crazi
and
i
didnt
realli
care
most
of
the
time
what
they
thought
you
will
probabl
think
he
crazi
too
but
god
is
veri
real
to
him
a
real
a
you
are
to
him
keep
that
in
mind
and
he
think
he
can
convinc
you
becaus
sinc
god
is
so
real
to
him
he
doesnt
see
whi
god
cant
be
real
to
you
too
i
dont
know
how
help
thi
is
to
you
but
all
the
best
anyhow
thi
is
quit
a
challeng
for
you
to
face
by
the
way
person
