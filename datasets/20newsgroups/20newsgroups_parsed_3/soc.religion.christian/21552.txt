you
propos
arguabl
tenuous
defin
the
danger
in
advis
christian
to
depend
upon
such
a
chang
is
clear
when
convers
doesnt
happen
which
is
almost
alway
the
peopl
are
often
left
in
despair
feel
exclud
from
a
church
that
ha
noth
more
to
say
but
a
requir
of
lifelong
celibaci
perhap
that
would
be
true
of
celibaci
from
homosexu
relat
or
refrainng
from
their
choic
relationship
but
that
doe
not
forbid
heterosexu
could
they
not
haveenjoy
heterosexu
relat
for
what
it
wa
worth
thi
depend
upon
the
person
in
some
case
i
think
the
answer
is
no
even
with
those
who
could
consid
what
your
ask
i
assum
were
talk
about
marriag
i
certainli
would
not
want
to
suggest
sex
outsid
that
your
talk
about
a
perman
commit
to
a
kind
of
sexual
relationship
that
they
arent
realli
sure
they
can
live
with
there
may
be
peopl
for
whom
thi
is
a
possibl
solut
but
i
wonder
whether
it
entir
fair
to
the
other
partner
i
have
a
cousin
who
wa
a
victim
of
exactli
thi
situat
we
found
out
later
after
