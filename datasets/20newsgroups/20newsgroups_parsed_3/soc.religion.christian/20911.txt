mani
cathol
will
decid
to
side
with
the
pope
there
is
some
sound
in
thi
becaus
the
papaci
is
infal
so
eventu
some
pope
will
straighten
all
thi
out
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
also
unsound
in
thi
in
that
in

may
inde
be

if
the

enough
they

badli
joe
your
logic
excap
me
if
the
papaci
is
infal
and
thi
is
a
matter
of
faith
then
the
pope
can
not
be
wrong
if
on
the
other
hand
thi
is
not
a
matter
of
faith
but
a
matter
of
church
law
then
we
should
still
obey
a
the
pope

the
legal
head
