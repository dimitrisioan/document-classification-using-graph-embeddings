an

argument

theism
on
sun
may
damon
wrote
a
christian
friend
of
mine
onc
reason
that
if
we
were
never
creat
we
could
not
exist
therefor
we
were
creat
and
therefor
there
exist
a
creator
i
hesit
to
comment
on
the
valid
of
thi
becaus
i
do
not
know
what
your
friend
meant
by
it
if
he
meant
that
whatev
exist
must
have
been
creat
then
he
is
open
to
the
obviou
retort
that
god
exist
and
so
god
must
have
been
creat
perhap
your
friend
meant
that
we
exist
now
but
that
there
wa
a
time
when
we
did
not
exist
and
therefor
someth
other
than
ourselv
must
have
brought
u
into
exist
thi
seem
plausibl
but
an
atheist
might
repli
so

so
what
here
your
friend
would
have
to
explain
whi
an
infinit

he
would
have
some
support
from

and
some
other
who
are
in
the

have
argu
for
a

he
would
have
to
bridg
the
gap
between
said
entiti
and
the

of

if
he
