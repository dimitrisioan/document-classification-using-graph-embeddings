subject
the
nicen
creed
wa
re
major
view
of
the
triniti
michael
bushnel
write
the
socal
creed
of
athanasiu
howev
ha
alway
been
a
western
creed
and
ha
alway
had
the
filioqu
the
orthodox
have
said
that
they
accept
all
that
it
say
with
the
except
of
the
filioqu
but
it
is
not
in
use
which
is
exactli
what
i
point
out
though
i
wa
wrong
about
your
use
of
the
creed
the
cathol
encylcopedia
in
which
i
read
about
it
said
the
orthodox
do
use
the
creed
minu
the
filioqu
appar
that
ha
chang
the
athanasian
creed
ha
alway
had
the
filioqu
the
nicen
constantinopolitan
did
not
of
cours
the
orthodox
did
not
delet
the
filioqu
from
the
nicen
creed
it
wasnt
there
to
begin
with
but
they
certainli
did
from
the
athanasian
creed
which
did
have
it
from
the
begin
i
might
point
out
that
the
whole
problem
start
over
the
differ
in
way
of
explain
the
gener
of
the
bless
triniti
the
east
emphas
the
idea
of
the
holi
spirit
proceed
from
the
father
through
the
son
and
the
west
use
proceed
from
the
father
and
the
son
in
fact
some
such
a
tertullian
use
both
formul
see
below
follow
therefor
the
form
of
these
exampl
i
profess
that
i
do
call
god
and
hi
word
the
father
and
and
hi
son
two
for
the
root
and
the
stem
are
two
thing
but
conjoin
the
fountain
and
the
river
are
two
kind
but
indivis
the
sun
and
the
ray
are
two
form
but
coher
one
anyth
which
proce
from
anoth
must
necessarili
be
a
second
to
that
from
which
it
proce
but
it
is
not
on
that
account
separ
from
it
where
there
is
second
howev
there
are
two
and
where
ther
is
third
there
are
three
the
spirit
then
is
third
from
god
and
the
son
just
a
the
third
from
the
root
is
the
fruit
of
the
stem
and
third
from
the
fountain
is
the
stream
from
the
river
and
thrid
from
the
sun
is
the
apex
of
the
ray
tertullian
against
praxea
about
ad
and
i
believ
that
the
spirit
proce
not
otherwis
than
from
the
father
through
the
son
tertullian
against
praxea
about
ad
and
a
st
thoma
show
in
hi
summa
theologica
part
question
articl
and
there
is
no
contradict
between
the
two
method
of
gener
and
in
fact
the
two
method
of
reckon
the
process
emphas
what
st
augustin
among
other
taught
that
the
holi
spirit
proce
from
the
father
and
the
son
but
he
proce
from
the
father
in
a
more
preemin
way
for
whatev
the
son
ha
he
ha
from
the
father
certainli
he
ha
it
from
the
father
that
the
holi
spirit
proce
from
him
for
the
father
alon
is
not
from
anoth
for
which
reason
he
alon
is
call
unbegotten
not
inde
in
the
scriptur
but
in
the
practic
of
theologian
and
of
those
who
employ
such
term
a
they
are
abl
in
a
matter
so
great
the
son
howev
is
born
of
the
father
and
the
holi
spirit
proce
princip
from
the
father
and
sinc
the
father
give
to
the
son
all
that
he
ha
without
ani
interv
of
time
the
holi
spirit
proce
jointli
from
both
father
and
son
he
would
be
call
son
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
if
which
is
abhor
to
everyon
of
sound
mind
they
had
both
begotten
him
the
spirit
wa
not
begotten
by
each
howev
but
proce
from
each
and
both
st
augustin
of
hippo
the
triniti
to
ad
so
in
a
sens
all
of
the
formul
are
correct
to
the
west
at
least
becaus
the
holi
spirit
proce
from
both
father
and
son
but
in
proceed
from
the
son
the
orgin
of
that
process
is
the
process
from
the
father
so
the
holi
spirit
is
proceed
from
the
father
through
the
son
but
a
all
that
the
son
ha
is
from
the
father
the
holi
spirit
can
be
said
to
proceed
from
the
father
without
ani
mention
of
the
son
be
necessari
in
ani
case
i
am
happi
to
know
that
i
follow
in
the
belief
of

i
st

of

forbidden
i
will
point
out
that
the
holi
father
of
ephesu
and
chalcedon
both
spoke
of
the
creed
of
nicea
in
their
statement
forbid
anyon
to
produc
write
or
compos
a
confess
of
faith
other
than
the
one
defin
by
the
father
of
nicea
that
creed
is
a
differ
creed
than
that
of
constantinopl
which
is
commonli
call
the
nicen
creed
not
of
cours
in
that
they
were
condemn
the
adopt
of
the
constantinopolitan
creed
which
is
but
an
enlarg
upon
the
creed
of
nicea
but
that
they
were
condemn
the
impiou
opinion
of
nestori
who
had
adopt
a
radic
differ
creed
from
the
one
use
by
the
church
which
among
other
thing
deni
the
process
of
the
holi
spirit
form
the
son
thu
the
addit
of
the
constantinopolitan
creed
were
not
thought
to
be
in
violat
of
thi
and
a
the
council
chalcedon
also
affirm
the
doctrin
of
the
process
of
the
holi
spirit
from
the
son
which
nestoriu
deni
they
could
hardli
have
been
against
explain
in
a
fuller
way
the
creed
for
they
themselv
approv
of
previou
addit
to
it
and
if
the
further
explan
of
the
creed
made
in
constantinopl
were
not
denigr
of
the
work
done
by
the
holi
father
of
nicea
or
in
ani
way
heret
it
follow
that
the
council
of
toledo
wa
fulli
abl
to
add
what
wa
not
disput
by
the
faith
to
the
creed
so
a
to
combat
the
impieti
of
the

in

becaus
the

wa
not
