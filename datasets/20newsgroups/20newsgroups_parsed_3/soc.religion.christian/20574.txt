can
caus
our
prayer
to
be
hinder
you
husband
likewis
live
with
your
wife
in
an
understand
way
a
with
a
weaker
vessel
sinc
she
is
a
woman
and
grant
her
honor
a
a
fellow
heir
of
the
grace
of
life
so
that
your
prayer
may
not
be
hinder
i
peter
one
interpret
ive
heard
of
thi
vers
is
that
it
refer
to
the
sin
of
physic
abus
one
wife
the
husband
is
usual
physic
stronger
than
hi
wife
but
is
not
permit
to
use
thi
to
domin
her
he
must
honor
her
a
hi
sister
in
christ
thi
would
therefor
be
an
exampl
of
a
specif
sin
that
block
prayer
thi
vers
also
make
me
think
of
the
kind
of
husband
who
decid
what
is
god
will
for
hi
famili
without
consult
hi
wife
god
reveal
hi
will
to
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
there
need
to
be
some
degre
of
mutual
in
decis
make
even
those
whose
understand
of
the
bibl
lead
to
a
belief
in
an
authoritarian
headship
of
the
husband
need
to
incorpor
thi
in
order
to
have
a
function
famili
one
way
to
look
at
it
is
that
god
speak
to
the
wife
through
the
husband
and
to
the
husband
through
the
wife
