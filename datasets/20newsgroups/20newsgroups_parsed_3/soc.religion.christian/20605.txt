new
testament
doubl
stan
seanna
sm
watson
ask
what
is
the
object
to
celebr
of
easter
the
object
natur
is
in
the
way
in
which
you
phrase
it
easter
or
eashtar
or
ishtar
or
ishtarti
or
other
spell
is
the
pagan
whore
goddess
of
fertil
therefor
your
question
to
me
is
what
is
the
object
to
celebr
of
the
pagan
whore
goddess
when
phrase
that
way
i
suspect
or
at
least
i
would
hope
that
it
becom
immeadi
appar
what
my
object
to
celebr
her
would
be
it
is
celebr
of
the
resurrect
of
jesu
no
you
are
think
perhap
of
ressurect
sunday
i
think
though
im
not
too
crazi
about
the
word
sunday
but
i
certainli
like
thi
phrase
much
better
than
envok
the
name
of
the
whore
goddess
for
that
matter
stay
biblic
and
call
it
omar
rasheet
the
feast
of
first
fruit
torah
command
that
thi
be
observ
on
the
day
follow
the
sabbath
of
passov
week
sunday
by
ani
other
name
in
modern
parlanc
whi
is
there
so
much
object
to
observ
the
resurrect
on
the
st
day
of
the
week
on
which
it
actual
occur
whi
jump
it
all
over
the
calendar
the
way
easter
doe
whi
not
just
go
with
the
sunday
follow
passov
the
way
the
bibl
ha
it
whi
seek
after
unbibl
method
i
dont
recal
a
command
in
scriptur
for
u
to
celebr
the
resurrect
but
it
is
the
sole
and
onli
reason
that
we
are
christianshow
could
we
not
celebr
it
so
what
doe
thi
question
have
to
do
with
easter
the
whore
goddess
i
am
all
for
celebr
the
resurrect
just
keep
that
whore
out
of
the
discuss
if
it
is
onli
the
name
which
is
a
problem
i
suggest
that
if
we
are
too
concern
about
etymolog
there
are
a
lot
of
word
we
are
go
to
have
to
drop
a
an
asid
some
termin
pc
peopl
here
in
ottawa
want
dictionari
to
be
alter
so
that
there
are
no
neg
definit
associ
with
the
word
black
so
a
not
to
offend
peopl
of
colour
ye
i
have
heard
of
your
newspap
speak
of
the
need
to
repav
street
with
afrocanadiantop
grin
i
still
think
blacktop
sound
better
though
a
a
short
person
i
hope
they
will
also
remov
the
definit
curt
or
surli
associ
with
my
physic
descript
fine
by
me
and
while
we
are
at
it
the
lefthand
peopl
are
both
sinist
and
gauch
so
we
probabl
will
have
some
object
from
that
quarter
a
well
in
quebec
french
the
word
for
the
celebr
of
the
resurrect
is
paquesthi
is
etymolog
relat
to
pesach
passov
and
the
pascal
lamb
so
is
the
french
canadian
mostli
roman
cathol
celebr
better
becaus
it
us
the
right
name
ye
that
sound
much
better
to
me
is
there
anyon
out
there
would
think
that
phrase
sound
wors
so
from
thi
i
infer
that
there
are
differ
rule
for
christian
of
jewish
descent
what
happen
to
there
is
neither
jew
nor
greek
slave
nor
free
male
nor
femal
for
all
are
one
in
christ
jesu
read
the
letter
to
philemon
now
tell
me
wa
philemon
slave
return
to
him
were
there
differ
rule
upon
the
slave
than
upon
philemon
how
about
male
and
femal
are
there
differ
rule
that
appli
to
them
a
well
or
if
there
is
no
more
male
and
femal
can
adam
and
steve
get
marri
to
each
other
in
your
congreg
ye
there
are
differ
in
form
and
function
but
the
way
we
come
to
salvat
in
messiah
remain
the
same
no
matter
what
our
posit
in
life
i
am
in
gener
not
in
favor
of
continu
thi
discuss
a
it
seem
repetit
but
thi
particular
point
is
one
that
i
believ
is
new
the
object
is
not
to
have
a
holiday
but
to
it
name
id
like
to
suggest
that
peopl
think
veri
care
about
thi
argument
word
often
chang
their
mean
over
time
the
day
of
the
week
are
of
cours
origin
base
on
pagan
god
some
christian
prefer
to
refer
to
first
day
second
day
etc
howev
the
major
of
christian
have
not
been
persuad
the
question
seem
to
be
whether
it
make
ani
differ
what
the
dictionari
show
a
the
deriv
of
a
word
if
what
peopl
mean
by
it
and
think
when
they
use
it
is
differ
inde
id
like
to
suggest
that
post
like
thi
could
themselv
be
danger
suppos
peopl
in
gener
use
easter
to
mean
the
celebr
of
christ
resurrect
post
tri
to
convinc
them
that
they
realli
mean
a
celebr
in
honor
of
some
godess
run
the
risk
of
creat
exactli
the
situat
that
they
claim
to
oppos
they
are
do
their
best
to
creat
a
linkag
in
peopl
mind
between
their
celebr
and
the
pagan
goddess
it
not
clear
that
thi
is
a
healthi
thing
