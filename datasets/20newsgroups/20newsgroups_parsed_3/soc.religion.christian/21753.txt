if
we
posit
two
mind
in
christ
the
mind
of
the
logo
and
the
mind
of
the
human
jesu
then
we
must
admit
two
will
a
mind
is
not
a
mind
without
a
will
i
know
thi
ha
been
dealt
with
in
past
church
prnouncement
but
there
is
a
philosoph
problem
here
that
should
examin
t
v
morri
argu
that
the
incarn
can
be
seen
like
thi
mind
of
logo
here
the
mind
of
jesu
is
circumsrib
by
god
the
human
son
god
the
son
ha
complet
access
to
the
human
mind
mind
but
the
human
mind
onli
ha
access
to
the
mind
of
god
the
son
when
the
son
allow
access
thi
explain
whi
jesu
said
even
he
did
not
know
the
time
of
the
kingdom
the
idea
of
a
complet
healthi
version
of
split
person
from
the
field
of
psycholog
and
the
intrigu
idea
of
be
in
a
dream
see
yourself
act
know
that
is
you
but
also
be
omnisci
ive
explain
it
here
befor
if
you
want
the
full
document
ask
me
by
mail
rex
question
aris
a
we
begin
to
think
about
logo
and
what
hi
inner
conscious
wa
compos
of
we
need
to
clarifi
the
two
natur
of
christ
briefli
the
divin
natur
which
ha
exist
etern
did
not
undertak
ani
essenti
chang
dure
the
incarn
which
would
caus
a
conflict
with
the
attribut
of
god
the
foremost
of
these
be
hi
immut
thi
would
mean
that
it
remain
impass
that
is
incap
of
suffer
and
death
free
from
ignor
and
insuscept
to
weak
and
temptat
in
the
realm
of
the
divin
natur
it
is
better
to
say
that
the
son
of
god
becam
that
which
wa
not
absoluteand
in
himself
the
result
of
the
incarn
wa
that
the
divin
logo
could
be
ignor
and
weak
could
be
tempt
and
suffer
and
die
not
in
hi
divin
natur
but
by
the
deriv
of
hi
posse
of
a
human
natur
thi
would
mean
that
both
the
properti
of
the
divin
natur
and
the
human
natur
are
properti
of
the
person
and
therefor
ascrib
to
the
person
by
thi
reason
we
can
say
that
the
person
can
be
omnipot
omnisci
and
omnipres
yet
at
the
same
time
be
also
a
man
of
limit
power
knowledg
a
man
of
sorrow
subject
to
human
want
and
miseri
there
is
howev
no
penetr
of
one
natur
into
the
other
deiti
can
no
more
share
the
imperfect
of
human
than
human
can
share
in
the
essenti
perfect
of
the
godhead
we
are
not
to
assum
that
there
is
a
doubl
person
due
to
the
posse
of
the
doubl
natur
christ
human
natur
is
imperson
in
that
it
attain
selfconsci
and
selfdetermin
in
the
person
of
the
godman
we
must
now
differenti
between
the
person
and
the
natur
of
the
man
natur
is
defin
the
distinguish
qualiti
or
properti
of
someth
the
fundament
charact
disposit
or
tempera
of
a
live
be
innat
and
unchang
natur
is
then
in
essenc
the
substanc
posse
in
common
in
a
such
the
triniti
have
one
natur
there
is
also
a
common
natur
of
mankind
person
on
the
other
hand
is
the
separ
subsist
of
natur
with
the
power
of
conscious
and
will
it
is
for
thi
reason
that
the
human
natur
of
christ
ha
not
nor
ever
had
a
separ
subsist
that
it
is
imperson
logo
the
godman
repres
the
principl
of
person
it
is
equal
import
to
see
that
selfconsci
and
selfdetermin
do
not
a
such
belong
to
the
natur
it
is
for
thi
reason
that
we
can
justifi
say
that
jesu
did
not
have
two
conscious
or
two
will
but
rather
one
it
is
theanthrop
an
activ
of
the
one
person
which
unit
in
itself
the
human
and
the
divin
natur
be
that
neither
the
conscious
nor
the
will
are
simpli
human
or
simpli
divin
the
quotat
given
abov
is
not
identifi
and
it
not
entir
clear
to
me
what
posit
loren
is
take
on
it
just
for
clariti
let
me
note
that
the
view
express
in
it
is
one
of
the
classic
christolog
heresi
monothelit
that
the
posit
that
christ
two
natur
were
not
complet
in
that
there
wa
onli
one
will
in
most
case
which
i
think
includ
thi
exampl
it
wa
the
human
will
that
wa
regard
a
miss
normal
peopl
who
talk
about
christ
human
natur
a
be
imperson
mean
it
in
a
somewhat
more
abstract
sen
that
is
they
are
use
person
a
hypostati
not
in
the
usual
english
sen
of
person
in
thi
use
the
doctrin
is
call
anhypostasia
person
i
think
anhypostasia
is
just
a
more
sophist
way
of
deni
that
the
logo
took
on
human
fulli
howev
it
ha
never
been
formal
rule
a
heresi
and
in
fact
ha
been
held
by
influenti
theologian
both
ancient
and
modern
eg
athanasiu
but
the
quotat
abov
appear
to
be
go
farther
than
even
athanasiu
went
into
the
realm
of
the
overtli
