re
deuterocan
ep
sirach
thank
for
the
respons
so
far
i
hope
that
i
have
spark
some
thought
which
is
more
my
intent
than
to
restart
one
of
the
reform
im
just
go
to
tug
on
two
thread
in
messageid
d
andrew
byler
write
and
i
must
point
out
that
the
jew
onli
drew
up
their
canon
in
ad
year
after
the
found
of
the
christian
religion
upon
the
cross
whi
should
we
adher
to
a
canon
that
wa
drawn
up
by
the
faithless
in
reaction
to
the
chrsitian
use
of
the
greek
septuagint
which
includ
the
deuterocanon
i
wa
simpli
observ
that
a
a
nonjew
i
am
not
in
that
commun
which
might
be
bound
by
such
a
decis
i
dont
know
much
about
the
council
of
jamnia
but
i
have
heard
that
it
is
not
wellattest
histor
faithless
ha
noth
to
do
with
it
and
i
prefer
not
to
specul
about
motif
a
earli
a
ad
st
justin
had
alreadi
accus
the
jew
of
mutil
the
canon
of
scriptur
by
their
remov
of
certain
book
i
wish
the
dialoguewithtrypho
were
a
real
transcript
of
a
real
dialogu
but
i
think
it
a
fiction
effect
on
justin
part
put
that
to
one
side
justin
point
may
be
evidenti
one
would
want
to
know
which
book
protest
appar
prefer
to
think
that
god
revel
wa
limit
by
a
decre
of
the
jew
perhap
the
reform
were
travel
in
all
the
light
m
evid
they
had
let
stick
to
the
issu
again
i
prefer
not
to
specul
about
motif
one
would
need
quot
from
luther
calvin
etc
to
evid
thi
prefer
in
messageid
david
wagner
that
is
not
quit
accur
otherwis
we
would
have
the
book
of
enoch
in
the
canon
a
dave
note
one
can
say
that
the
apocrypha
are
not
quot
by
christ
is
thi
the
principl
ani
bc
text
not
quot
by
christ
can
not
be
count
a
scriptur
think
well
about
thi
job
ruth
i
wrote
these
is
a
logic
invalid
a
priori
besid
we
are
talk
about
ot
text
which
in
mani
part
are
superced
by
the
nt
in
the
xtian
view
would
not
thi
same
principl
exclud
ecclesiast
thi
principl
can
not
be
consist
appli
dave
w
answer
i
have
to
reject
your
argument
here
the
spirit
speak
with
one
voic
and
he
doe
not
contradict
himself
mean
what
do
you
affirm
the
principl
that
the
dc
can
be
exclud
sinc
they
contain
fals
doctrin
or
do
you
deni
it
if
affirm
a
is
impli
in
your
statement
how
doe
one
determin
that
doctrin
x
is
fals
do
you
affirm
everi
teach
in
ecclesiast
the
ultim
test
of
canon
is
whether
the
word
are
inspir
by
the
spirit
ie
godbreath
it
is
a
test
which
is
more
guid
by
faith
than
by
reason
or
logic
if
so
it
may
be
a
test
that
can
not
be
appli
the
orthodox
faith
believ
that
psalm
is
canon
how
can
my
faith
say
not
all
i
hear
here
is
the
a
priori
i
mention
befor
the
deuterocanon
book
were
ad
much
later
in
the
church
histori
thi
is
contrari
to
fact
they
do
not
have
the
same
spiritu
qualiti
a
the
rest
of
scriptur
can
thi
be
elev
to
a
principl
how
is
spiritu
qualiti
measur
ill
take
the
spiritu
qualiti
of
most
of
sirach
over
joshua
or
chronicl
ani
day
i
do
not
believ
the
church
that
ad
these
book
wa
guid
by
the
spirit
in
so
do
what
can
i
say
you
believ
what
you
believ
im
ask
for
a
consist
check
i
dont
see
that
the
book
were
ad
in
ani
construct
thi
formul
beg
the
question
no
one
can
validli
ask
me
to
have
faith
that
these
book
are
noncanon
dave
davi
these
are
my
opinion
activ
alon
qotd
christian
is
not
a
doctrin
not
i
mean
a
theori
about
what
ha
happen
and
will
happen
to
the
human
soul
but
a
descript
of
someth
that
actual
take
place
in
a
human
life
for
conscious
of
sin
is
a
real
event
and
so
are
despair
and
salvat
through
faith
those
who
speak
of
such
thing
bunyan
for
instanc
are
simpli
describ
what
ha
happen
to
them
whatev
anyon
may
want
to
say
about
it
