david

write
thi
paragraph
brought
to
mind
a
question
how
do
you
mormon
reconcil
the
idea
of
etern
marriag
with
christ
statement
that
in
the
ressurect
peopl
will
neither
marri
nor
be
given
in
marriag
luke
chapt
delet
i
think
what
jesu
is
say
here
and
it
is
clearest
in
matthew
and
mark
account
is
that
marriag
will
not
be
perform
in
the
resurrect
thi
goe
along
with
our
belief
that
if
a
person
is
to
marri
at
all
it
must
be
done
on
thi
earth
delet
the
problem
with
thi
view
is
that
the
topic
under
discus
in
thi
passag
is
marriag
that
were
perform
on
earth
jesu
word
seem
to
me
to
indic
that
he
regard
hi
respons
a
the
answer
to
their
question
about
which
earthli
marriag
would
be
valid
after
the
resurrect
thi
be
the
case
the
most
straightforward
interpret
in
my
opinion
is
that
marriag
doe
not
exist
in
the
next
life
becaus
those
who
are
rais
are
of
a
differ
natur
than
what
we
are
now
other
wise
whi
would
jesu
offer
but
are
like
the
angel
in
heaven
a
a
contrast
to
the
idea
of
the
resurrect
marri
and
be
given
in
marriag
we
do
not
have
angellik
natur
now
but
someday
we
shall
and
when
we
do
our
earthli
marriag
will
be
irrelev
or
at
least
that
what
i
think
jesu
is
say
about
the
postresurrect
valid
of
marriag
perform
on
earth
your
mileag
may
vari
mark
