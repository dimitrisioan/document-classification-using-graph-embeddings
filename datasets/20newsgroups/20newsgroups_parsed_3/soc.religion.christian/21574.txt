if

not
a
mind
without
a

i
know
thi
ha
been
dealt
with
in
past

there
is
a
philosoph
problem
here
that
should
examin
t
v
morri

that
the

can
be
seen
like
thi

with
the

but
if
the
human
will
would
have

differ
than
what
wa
intend
the

would
have
interced
but
thi
wa
never
the

the
idea
of
a

but
also
be

the
