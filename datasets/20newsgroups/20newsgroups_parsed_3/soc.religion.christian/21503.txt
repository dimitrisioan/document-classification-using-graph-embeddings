hate
the
sin
but
love
the
sinner
heard
that
quit
a
bit
recent
often
in
the
context
of
discuss
about
christian
and
homosexu
but
the
context
realli
isnt
that
import
my
question
is
whether
that
statement
is
consist
with
christian
i
would
think
not
hate
beget
more
hate
never
love
consid
some
sin
ill
leav
it
unnam
sinc
i
dont
want
thi
to
digress
into
an
argument
a
to
whether
or
not
someth
is
a
sin
now
let
appli
our
hate
the
sin
philosophi
and
see
what
happen
if
we
truli
hate
the
sin
then
the
more
we
see
it
the
stronger
our
hatr
of
it
will
becom
eventu
thi
hate
becom
so
strong
that
we
becom
disgust
with
the
sinner
and
eventu
come
to
hate
the
sinner
in
addit
our
hatr
of
the
sin
often
caus
u
to
say
and
do
thing
which
are
taken
person
by
the
sinner
who
often
doe
not
even
believ
what
they
are
do
is
a
sin
after
enough
of
thi
the
sinner
begin
to
hate
u
they
certainli
dont
love
u
for
our
constant
critic
of
their
behavior
hate
build
up
and
drive
peopl
away
from
godthi
certainli
can
not
be
a
good
way
to
build
love
in
the
summari
of
the
law
christ
command
u
to
love
god
and
to
love
our
neighbor
he
doesnt
say
anyth
about
hate
in
fact
if
anyth
he
command
u
to
save
our
critic
for
ourselv
so
how
are
christian
suppos
to
deal
with
the
sin
of
other
i
suppos
that
there
is
onli
one
way
to
deal
with
sin
either
in
other
or
ourselvesthrough
prayer
we
need
to
ask
god
to
help
u
with
our
own
sin
and
to
help
those
we
love
with
their
onli
love
can
conquer
sinhatr
ha
no
place
the
best
way
to
love
someon
is
to
pray
for
them
