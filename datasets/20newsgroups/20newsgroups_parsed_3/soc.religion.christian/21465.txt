subject
re
atheist
and
hell
to
summar
while
question
the
sagac
of
someon
who
said
they
would
rather
spend
an
etern
in
hell
than
be
besid
god
in
heaven
know
even
one
man
would
spend
hi
etern
life
be
scorch
for
hi
wrongdo
i
describ
how
horribl
hell
is
and
compar
the
abov
statement
with
jesu
suffer
on
the
cross
in
order
to
prevent
peopl
go
to
hell
which
kenneth
engel
challeng
did
thi
happen
to
jesu
i
dont
think
so
not
from
what
i
heard
he
live
one
day
of
suffer
and
die
if
the
wage
of
sin
is
the
abov
paragraph
then
jesu
didnt
pay
for
our
sin
did
he
i
will
wimp
out
and
admit
that
i
never
like
the
metaphor
of
jesu
pay
for
our
sin
in
the
sens
that
mani
christian
accept
a
liter
the
point
is
that
god
understand
the
suffer
we
go
through
not
just
intellectu
like
when
we
watch
the
somalian
on
tv
but
realli
understand
he
can
feel
our
pain
thi
fact
is
manifest
by
jesu
life
we
can
argu
that
someon
in
histori
might
have
suffer
more
than
jesu
we
can
think
of
more
horribl
tortur
than
crucifixion
we
can
think
of
case
of
betray
and
fruitless
effort
lead
to
wors
despair
but
the
main
point
is
that
jesu
is
in
the
trench
with
u
he
is
in
everyon
whatev
i
do
to
the
least
of
human
i
do
to
him
and
whatev
i
do
for
the
least
of
human
i
do
for
him
now
to
reconcil
thi
with
the
exist
of
hell
is
beyond
my
capabl
but
that
wasnt
my
goal
id
be
surpris
to
see
the
moder
let
thi
one
through
thank
our
moder
is
surpris
but
i
serious
want
a
reason
explan
for
thi
a
i
reread
thi
i
must
admit
that
thi
is
more
of
a
descript
of
my
faith
than
an
explan
but
perhap
that
all
i
can
do
hope
that
all
i
have
to
do
chri
mussack
