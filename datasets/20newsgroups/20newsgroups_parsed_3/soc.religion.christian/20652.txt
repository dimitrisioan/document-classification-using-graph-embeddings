re
the
arrog
of
christian
carol
alvin
wrote
in
the
new
testament
sorri
i
dont
have
a
bibl
at
work
and
cant
provid
a
refer
woman
are
instruct
to
be
silent
and
cover
their
head
in
church
now
thi
is
scriptur
by
your
definit
thi
is
truth
and
therefor
absolut
do
woman
in
your
church
speak
do
they
cover
their
head
if
all
scriptur
is
absolut
truth
it
seem
to
me
that
woman
speak
in
and
come
to
church
with
bare
head
should
be
intoler
to
evangel
yet
clearli
woman
do
speak
in
evangel
church
and
come
with
bare
head
at
least
thi
wa
the
case
in
the
evangel
church
i
grew
up
in
evangel
are
clearli
not
take
thi
particular
part
of
scriptur
to
be
absolut
truth
and
there
are
plenti
of
other
exampl
can
you
reconcil
thi
the
problem
you
see
here
is
that
some
christian
claim
thing
about
the
bibl
which
they
dont
actual
believ
or
practic
ive
known
all
sort
of
christian
rang
from
the
trendiest
of
liber
to
the
firebreath
fundamentalist
and
although
mani
on
the
conserv
side
of
the
christian
faith
do
claim
that
the
bibl
is
a
perhap
the
sourc
of
absolut
truth
i
dont
know
of
anyon
who
treat
it
a
anyth
other
than
a
valuabl
part
of
a
live
tradit
while
i
am
not
a
roman
cathol
i
believ
thi
is
close
to
the
offici
posit
of
the
rc
church
perhap
an
rc
would
like
to
comment
the
particular
practic
you
refer
to
will
usual
be
explain
in
term
of
the
social
context
of
the
time
you
would
think
the
fact
that
the
conserv
seem
to
have
to
break
out
the
tophatandcan
and
give
you
some
big
songandd
routin
about
whi
thi
other
passag
a
well
arent
directli
applic
today
would
show
them
that
what
they
claim
about
the
bibl
and
what
they
actual
practic
are
two
differ
thing
but
mostli
it
doenst
while
thi
thread
is
suppos
to
be
about
the
arrog
of
christian
i
would
suggest
that
some
of
the
problem
is
realli
hypocrasi
in
thi
case
make
claim
about
the
bibl
which
the
claimant
dont
actual
put
into
practic
but
if
we
step
back
from
the
namecal
and
look
at
what
peopl
are
attempt
to
say
we
see
that
they
are
tri
to
express
veri
concis
the
uniqu
place
the
bibl
hold
within
the
christian
faith
so
when
peopl
use
such
word
or
phrase
a
word
of
god
inerr
infallibal
the
manufactur
handbook
the
onli
rule
of
faith
and
practic
in
the
church
today
to
describ
the
bibl
we
should
tri
to
hear
what
they
are
say
and
not
just
look
at
the
mere
word
they
use
some
of
the
abov
descript
are
demostrat
fals
and
other
are
selfcontradictori
but
in
my
experi
peopl
are
gener
pretti
good
at
pick
out
the
intent
of
the
speaker
even
when
the
speaker
word
are
at
varianc
with
their
intent
a
biblic
exampl
is
from
the
garden
of
eden
where
god
ask
where
are
you
and
adam
explain
that
he
wa
nake
and
afraid
and
hid
himself
if
adam
had
answer
god
word
he
would
have
said
someth
like
im
here
in
thi
tree
the
problem
seem
to
aris
when
christian
insist
that
these
word
are
inde
accur
reflect
of
their
beleif
most
peopl
have
not
made
a
determin
effort
to
work
out
their
own
understand
of
the
place
of
the
bibl
within
their
own
faith
and
so
reli
on
the
phrase
and
explan
that
other
use
