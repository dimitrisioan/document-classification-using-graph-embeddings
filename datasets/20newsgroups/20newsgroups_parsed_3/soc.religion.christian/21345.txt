on
which
cathol
doctrin
is
base
end
with
the
death
of
st

i
made
sure
i
use

everyon
to
believ
the
revel
contain
in
the

is
a
signific
subset
of
public
revel
privat
revel
is
revel
that
god
give
to
an
individu
he
may
speak

the

a

the

devot
practic
may
be
base
on

but
doctrin
can
not
when
an

attract
suffici

the

may
investig

indic
a
likelihood
that
the

is
in

from
god
it
will
be
approv
that
mean
that
it
can
be
preach
in
the
church
howev
it
is
still
true
that
no
one
is
requir
to
believ
that
it
came
from
god
a
cathol
is
free
to
deni
the
authent
of
even
the
most
well
attest
and
strongli
approv
privat
revel
such
a
those
at
fatima
and
lourd
i
suspect
that
few
if
ani
cathol
do
reject
fatima
and
lourd
but
if
ani
do
their
reject
of
them
doe
not
mean
they
are
not
orthodox
cathol
in

i
do
not

us
in
evalu

not
someth
i
need
everi

i
know
that
one
of
the
primari
requir
is
that
