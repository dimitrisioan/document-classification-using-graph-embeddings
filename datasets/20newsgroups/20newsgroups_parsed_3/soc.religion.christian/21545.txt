charg
them
with
hypocrici
for

easier
to
cast
asid
ani
hope
of
reach
true
humil
and
mere
hide
behind

instead
but
we
should
examin

we
react
to
certain
situat
with
such
emot
for
instanc
mani
of
u
feel
justifi
to
be
insult
by
an
arrog
person
a
if
we
need
a
reason
to
feel
insult
but
after
be
insult
over
and
over
again
by
the
word
of
other
youd
think
wed
either
toughen
up
or
decid
not
to
be
insult
or
ignor
the
insult
just
becaus
you
can
justifi
feel
of
anger
or
insult
or
outrag
that
doesnt
make
that
reaction
the
appropri
one
it
is
in
thi
light
of
selfexamin
that
we
can
chang
our
emot
reaction
sometim
it
help
when
we
can
understand
and
feel
the
differ
between
what
is
a
true
statement
of
our

and
what
