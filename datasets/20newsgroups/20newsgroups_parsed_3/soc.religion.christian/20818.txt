what
in

doubl
stan
in

daniel
segard
write
that
argument
would
be
more
compel
if
it
were
not
for
the
ishtar
egg
and
ishtar
bunni
whi
mix
pagan
fertil
symbol
from
the
worship
of
the
pagan
goddess
of
fertil
with
biblic
belief
what
would
realli
be
lost
if
all
of
you
were
to
just
drop
the
word
easter
and
replac
all
such
occur
with
resurrect
sunday
would
you
not
show
up
for
servic
if
they
were
call
resurrect
sunday
servic
rather
than
easter
servic
there
is
anoth
way
to
view
thi
the
true
celebr
is
easter
the
resurrect
of
our
lord
thi
ha
been
true
from
the
foundat
of
the
world
pagan
practic
are
then
either
foreshadow
of
the
true
celebr
of
the
resurrect
in
which
dim
light
wa
shone
forth
so
that
peopl
would
recogn
the
full
truth
when
it
wa
manifest
or
satan
counterfeit
intend
to
deceiv
u
so
that
we
would
not
recogn
the
truth
when
it
wa
manifest
i
dont
believ
the
second
argument
becaus
i
believ
in
the
power
of
the
resurrect
the
fulfil
of
the
incarn
and
our
hope
earlier
or
parallel
idea
in

religion
clearli
are
dim
imag
of
the
truth
of
the
resurrect
a
paul
state
we

do
other
it
serv
no
purpos
argu
about
who
ha
the
darker
or
lighter
glass
the
foreshadow
are
not
perfect
so
what
our
understnd
of

is
today
imperfect
for
we
are
not

perfect
theosi
is
not
