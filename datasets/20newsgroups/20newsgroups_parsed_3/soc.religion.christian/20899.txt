re
did
he
realli
rise
in
articl
scott
oser
write
and
the
two
simplest
refut
are
these
what
impact
the
onli
record
of
impact
come
from
the
new
testament
i
have
no
guarante
that
it
book
are
in
the
least
accur
and
that
the
record
impact
actual
happen
i
find
it
interest
that
no
other
contemporari
sourc
record
an
eclips
an
earthquak
a
templ
curtain
be
torn
etc
the
earliest
written
claim
we
have
of
jesu
resurrect
is
from
the
paulin
epistl
none
of
which
were
written
sooner
than
year
after
the
suppos
event
first
off
id
say
that
the
impact
if
right
befor
your
eye
that
we
are
even
discuss
thi
is
a
major
impact
in
and
of
itself
further
the
earli
church
bear
testimoni
to
the
impact
it
seem
probabl
that
no
one
display
the
bodi
of
jesu
becaus
no
one
knew
where
it
wa
i
person
believ
that
the
most
like
explan
wa
that
the
bodi
wa
stolen
by
discipl
or
by
graverobb
dont
bother
with
the
point
about
the
guard
it
onli
appear
in
one
gospel
and
seem
like
exactli
the
sort
of
thing
earli
christian
might
make
up
in
order
to
counter
the
graverob
charg
the
new
testament
doe
record
that
jew
believ
the
bodi
had
been
stolen
if
there
were
realli
guard
they
could
not
have
effect
made
thi
claim
a
they
did
of
cours
they
knew
where
it
wa
dont
forget
that
jesu
wa
seen
by
both
the
jew
and
the
roman
a
a
troublemak
pilat
wa
no
fool
and
didnt
need
the
addit
headach
of
some
fisherman
steal
jesu
bodi
to
make
it
appear
he
had
arisen
sinc
jesu
wa
buri
in
the
grave
of
a
man
well
know
to
the
sanhedrin
to
say
that
they
didnt
know
where
he
wa
buri
beg
the
question
now
you
say
that
you
think
that
the
discipl
stole
the
bodi
but
think
on
thi
a
moment
would
you
die
to
maintain
someth
you
knew
to
be
a
deliber
lie
if
not
then
whi
do
you
think
the
discipl
would
now
im
not
talk
about
die
for
someth
you
firmli
believ
to
be
the
truth
but
unbeknown
to
you
it
is
a
lie
mani
have
done
thi
no
im
talk
about
die
by
behead
stone
crucifixion
etc
for
someth
you
know
to
be
a
lie
thu
you
posit
with
regard
to
the
discipl
steal
the
bodi
seem
rather
lightweight
to
me
a
for
graverobb
whi
risk
the
sever
penalti
for
grave
rob
over
the
bodi
of
jesu
he
wasnt
buri
with
great
rich
so
again
thi
is
an
argument
that
can
be
discount
that
leaf
you
back
on
squar
one
what
happen
to
the
bodi
ihl
gene
the
opinion

the

or
again
let
me
comment
that
the
most
plausibl
nonchristian
scenario
and
the
one
typic
suggest
by
sceptic
who
are
knowledg
about
the
nt
is
that
the
