write
if
the
papaci
is
infal
and
thi
is
a
matter
of
faith
then
the
pope
can
not
be
wrong
if
on
the
other
hand
thi
is
not
a
matter
of
faith
but
a
matter
of
church
law
then
we
should
still
obey
a
the
pope
is
the
legal
head
of
the
church
in
other
word
given
the
doctrin
of
infal
we
have
no
choic
but
to
obey
thi
is
a
primari
problem
in
the
church
today
what
you
are
say
is
more
or
le
heresi
you
might
call
it
infallibil
it
the
idea
that
the
pope
is
alway
right
in
everyth
he
say
or
doe
thi
is
virtual
all
over
the
place
especi
in
thi
countri
the
pope
is
onli
infal
under
certain
veri
specif
and
welldefin
condit
when
these
condit
are
not
met
he
can
make
mistak
he
can

a
coupl
histor
exampl
come
to
mind
bishop
robert
grossetest
wa
perhap
the
greatest
product
of
the
english
cathol
church
at
one
point
dure
hi
career
the
reign
pope
decid
to
instal
one
of
hi
nephew
in
an
english
see
bishop
grossetest
said
that
thi
would
happen
over
hi
dead
bodi
though
mayb
not
in
so
mani
word
you
have
to
treat
pope
with
respect
even
when
they
are
wrong
the
problem
wa
that
thi
nephew
would
just
collect
the
incom
of
the
see
and
probabl
never
set
foot
there
thi
would
depriv
the
peopl
of
the
see
of
a
shepherd
bishop
grossetest
wa
quit
right
in
what
he
did
anoth
exampl
is
that
of
pope
john
xxii
a
pope
of
the
middl
age
he
decid
that
soul
that
were
save
did
not
enjoy
the
beatif
vision
until
the
last
judgement
he
decid
that
thi
should
be
a
defin
doctrin
of
the
church
though
he
didnt
quit
get
around
to
defin
it
now
there
no
way
thi
is
compat
with
cathol
doctrin
the
pope
doctrin
wa
criticis
by
mani
in
the
church
he
went
so
far
a
to
put
a
number
of
hi
oppon
in
jail
even
in
the
end
he
had
to
admit
hi
mistak
shortli
befor
he
die
he
recant
hi
successor
made
the
exact
opposit
idea
a
dogma
of
the
church
if
you
consult
ani
of
the
great
cathol
theologian
who
treat
of
such
subject
such
a
st
robert
bellarmin
a
doctor
of
the
church
you
will
find
detail
discus
of
whether
the
pope
can
person
fall
into
heresi
or
schism
the
teach
of
all
such
theologian
is
that
the
command
of
a
pope
must
be
resist
if
they
are
to
the
detriment
of
the
cathol
faith
a
pope
author
is
given
for
the
purpos
of
build
up
the
cathol
church
command
in
conflict
with
thi
purpos
have
no
legal
or
moral
forc
