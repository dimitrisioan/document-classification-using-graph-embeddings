write
i
strongli
suspect
that
we
are

an
impass
here
which
is
whi
i
deign
from
comment
much
further
i
agre
that
well
probabl
never
agre
and
im
start
to
feel
frustrat
and
im
tire
of
have
my
convers
with
my
husband
domin
by
thi
topic
just
kid
i
do
have
to
say
though
that
particip
in
thi
discuss
ha
been
a
good
learn
experi
for
me
my
view
on
thi
topic
have
evolv
and
clarifi
through
thi
and
i
suspect
that
we
may
not
disagre
a
much
a
we
think
i
admit
that
im
strongli
prejud
against
evangel
christian
and
i
may
not
alway
be
ration
in
my
reaction
to
it
i
grew
up
in
ec
and
went
to
an
ec
colleg
it
wa
definit
the
wrong
place
for
me
and
i
react
strongli
to
ani
implic
that
ec
or
conserv
christian
ha
ani
sort
of
stronghold
on
true
christian
i
shudder
when
i
rememb
the
condescend
attitud
i
had
about
other
christian
who
didnt
adher
to
the
ec
model
i
have
come
to
see
that
my
real
object
to
thi
whole
notion
of
absolut
truth
is
the
action
i
have
seen
it
lead
to
i
have
had
some
veri
bad
experi
with
evangel
christian
claim
to
know
the
truth
and
judg
me
or
other
base
on
their
belief
that
they
have
the
answer
know
the
truth
doesnt
seem
to
leav
a
whole
lot
of
room
for
other
opinion
i
can
accept
your
belief
in
absolut
truth
a
long
a
you
dont
tri
to
use
that
belief
to
tri
to
forc
other
to
compli
with
it
and
you
are
veri
care
that
you
dont
hurt
other
with
it
love
your
neighbor
seem
to
go
total
out
the
window
when
one
know
the
truth
and
belief
that
everyon
should
be
live
by
that
truth
other
peopl
have
convict
about
the
truth
everi
bit
a
strong
and
sincer
a
your
base
on
care
search
prayer
and
their
relationship
with
god
dont
dismiss
them
becaus
god
didnt
lead
them
to
the
