re
homosexu
issu
in
christiani
he
is
hope
to
pas
a
resolut
that
more
or
le
state
that
we
the
member
of
the
church
agre
to
disagre
on
the
issu
admit
that
both
side
have
honestli
studi
the
scriptur
and
had
the
spirit
lead
them
to
differ
conclus
it
work
last
year
when
the
abort
issu
threaten
to
do
more
or
le
the
same
thing
and
he
is
hope
that
the
ga
can
foster
a
love
and
care
attitud
about
peopl
who
disagre
with
their
own
view
cliff
slaughterbeck
peopl
would
not
be
will
to
note
that
the
church
wa
not
will
to
live
with
thi
kind
of
compromis
with
ordin
of
woman
the
one
thing
that
will
definit
prevent
a
person
from
becom
a
presbyterian
minist
is
if
they
indic
that
they
dont
accept
ordin
of
woman
the
argument
is
that
we
cant
have
half
the
church
not
accept
the
leader
of
the
other
half
mayb
peopl
will
clh
it
might
be
interest
for
folk
to
know
that
the
church
of
scotland
also
a
presbyterian
church
manag
to
agre
to
disagre
over
woman
ordin
for
year
the
reason
wa
that
congreg
are
free
to
call
whoever
they
wish
and
that
minist
and
session
choos
elder
if
a
congreg
did
not
wish
to
have
a
woman
they
were
not
oblig
to
and
if
a
session
did
not
wish
to
they
could
not
be
forc
to
note
that
the
who
issu
of
freedom
to
call
on
the
part
of
the
congreg
is
veri
import
here
thi
year
is
the
th
annivarsari
of
the
disrupt
where
the
church
split
on
that
veri
issu
they
didnt
get
back
togeth
for
almost
year
a
coupl
of
year
ago
on
the
anniversari
of
the
allow
of
woman
ordin
the
posit
wa
chang
so
that
in
theori
all
minist
and
elder
must
recognis
that
woman
can
be
ordain
in
theori
a
minist
who
refus
to
ordain
a
woman
to
hi
session
or
refus
to
work
with
a
woman
minist
in
presbyteri
could
be
disciplin
in
practic
thi
ha
not
happen
and
i
believ
it
is
unlik
to
happen
my
person
view
is
that
the
new
legisl
wa
a
mistak
and
that
the
permiss
but
not
prescript
legisl
work
veri
well
we
are
go
to
start
go
round
the
homosexu
debat
at
next
year
assembl
at
thi
year
a
motion
wa
put
to
ban
the
bless
of
samesex
coupl
after
an
edinburgh
minist
did
so
our
panel
on
doctrin
is
current

at
marriag
and
will
report
next
year

matter
will
be
consid
