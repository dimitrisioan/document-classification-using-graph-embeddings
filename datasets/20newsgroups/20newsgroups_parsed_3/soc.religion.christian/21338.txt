in

it
is
genuin
destuct
to
the
caus
of

serf
to
further
drive

thi
is
one
of
the
least
attract
part
of
some
varieti
of

although
im
sure
it
possibl
to
argu
theolog
that
we
shouldnt
make
analog
between
discrimin
on

race
and
discrimin
on
the

moral
the
case
look
unanswer

dislik
peopl
who

accept
homosexu
altogeth
my
experi
is
that
is
the
most
common
attitud
i
imagin
and
are
limit
to
a

i
suppos
i
can
go
along
with
except
that
i
have
thi
feel
that
a
year
old
live
in
a
commun
with
thi
attitud
on
discov
that
they
were
more
attract
to
member
of
the
same
sex
would
not
feel
the
love
of
the
commun
but
would
rather
feel
the
pressur
not
to
exhibit
their
feel
im
not
say
that
the
commun
in
particular
the
parent
would
not
love
the
child
but
i
suspect
the
child
would
not
feel
love
