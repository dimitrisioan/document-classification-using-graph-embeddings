if
you
do
sincer
believ
that
a

exist
whi
do
you

do

author
mean
anyth
to
you
i
defi

theist
to

deletia
formal
i
probabl
should
let
thi
pa
it
not
worth
the
time
and
it
not
realli
intend
for
me
but
i
couldnt
resist
a
person
weak
of
mine
jerkiu
kneeu
tragic
incur
the
foundat
for
faith
in
god
is
reason
without
which
the
exist
of
god
could
not
be
proven
that
hi
exist
can
be
proven
by
reason
is
indisput
cf
my
short
treatis
tradit
proof
for
the
exist
of
god
and
summa
theologica
not
so
i
can
prove
that
the
exist
of
god
is
disput
by
show
that
peopl
disput
it
thi
is
easi
i
disput
that
god
exist
simpl
i
miss
your
tradit
proof
treatis
but
the
proof
i
rememb
from
the
summa
theolog
the
way
i
think
it
wa
were
rather
poor
stuff
the
ontolog
argument
is
about
a
billion
time
better
imho
i
would
think
youd
want
nontradit
proof
consid
the
gener
failur
of
the
tradit
proof
at
least
the
one
i
know
of
i
am
think
of
the
ontolog
argument
the
cosmolog
argument
and
the
teleolog
argument
those
are
the
one
tradit
enough
to
have
funni
name
anyway
now
given
that
god
exist
and
that
hi
exist
can
be
proven
by
reason
i
assert
that
hi
command
must
be
follow
blindli
although
in
our
fallen
condit
we
must
alway
have
some
measur
of
doubt
about
our
faith
whi
thi
is
the
real
question
so
to
discu
it
ill
assum
god
exist
otherwis
there
is
no
heavenli
author
to
babbl
about
becaus
god
is
the
first
caus
of
all
thing
the
first
mover
of
matter
the
independ
thing
that
requir
noth
els
for
it
exist
the
measur
of
all
that
is
perfect
and
the
essenti
be
who
give
order
to
the
univers
logo
pleas
show
thi
is
the
case
i
am
familiar
with
the
first
caus
argument
and
ill
accept
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
is
a
first
caus
even
though
i
find
some
of
it
premic
question
the
rest
youll
have
to
show
thi
includ
that
the
first
caus
is
god
i
next
assert
that
god
is
all
good
got
it
i
deni
that
god
is
all
good
so
there
if
thi
is
so
then
that
which
is
contrari
to
the
will
of
god
is
evil
ie
the
absenc
of
the
good
and
sinc
god
can
never
contradict
himself
then
by
hi
promis
of
a
savior
a
earli
a
the
protoevangelium
of
genesi
god
instruct
that
becaus
a
human
adam
wa
first
respons
for
man
alien
from
the
sourc
of
all
good
a
man
would
be
requir
to
act
to
restor
the
friendship
thu
god
becam
incarn
in
the
person
of
the
messiah
thi
isnt
selfconsist
if
human
must
renew
the
relationship
then
god
incarn
or
not
cant
do
it
well
unless
you
think
god
is
human
grant
god
made
himself
human
but
thi
is
nonetheless
cheat
the
intent
of
the
statement
is
clearli
that
man
ha
to
fix
the
problem
he
caus
god
fix
it
even
by
indirect
mean
contradict
thi
now
thi
messiah
claim
that
he
is
the
truth
john
if
thi
claim
is
true
then
we
are
bound
by
reason
to
follow
him
who
is
truth
incarn
whi
also
whi
assum
said
claim
is
true
anyway
if
i
claim
to
be
truth
are
you
bound
by
reason
to
follow
me
you
next
seem
to
have
a
problem
with
author
have
you
tri
the
unit
state
marin
corp
yet
i
can
tell
you
firsthand
that
it
is
an
excel
instructor
in
author
undoubt
do
you
mean
to
impli
we
should
all
obey
the
command
of
the
marin
without
question
you
seem
to
impli
thi
about
god
and
that
the
marin
are
similar
in
thi
respect
if
thi
is
not
what
you
are
tri
to
say
they
pleas
explain
what
it
is
you
are
say
a
i
have
miss
it
if
you
have
not
yet
had
the
privileg
i
will
repli
that
the
author
which
is
truth
incarn
may
never
be
question
and
thu
must
be
follow
blindli
whi
whi
not
question
it
even
if
it
is
truth
we
can
not
know
thi
certainli
so
whi
is
it
so
irrat
to
question
perhap
we
will
thu
discov
that
we
were
wrong
you
assert
that
god
is
truth
and
we
cant
question
truth
but
i
assert
that
god
is
not
truth
and
anyway
we
can
question
truth
how
is
it
my
assert
is
le
good
than
your
one
may
not
deni
the
truth
oh
i
herebi
deni
i
hope
youll
agre
is
the
truth
grant
i
look
pretti
damn
silli
say
someth
like
that
but
i
need
someth
wed
both
agre
wa
clearli
true
now
youll
notic
no
stormtroop
have
march
in
to
drag
me
off
to
the
gulag
no
heaven
light
bolt
either
no
mysteri
net
outag
i
seem
to
be
permit
to
say
such
thing
absurd
or
not
for
exampl
when
the
proverbi
appl
fell
on
isaac
newton
head
he
could
have
deni
that
it
happen
but
he
did
not
the
law
of
physic
must
be
obey
whether
a
human
like
them
or
not
they
are
true
they
are
certainli
not
true
at
least
the
one
newton
deriv
are
not
true
and
are
inde
wildli
inaccur
at
high
speed
or
small
distanc
we
do
not
have
a
set
of
law
of
physic
that
alway
work
in
all
case
if
we
did
physic
would
be
over
alreadi
scienc
is
all
about
question
thi
sort
of
truth
if
we
didnt
wed
still
follow
aristotl
id
gener
thi
a
littl
more
if
you
want
to
learn
anyth
new
you
must
question
the
thing
you
know
tm
becaus
you
can
alway
be
wrong
therefor
the
author
which
is
truth
may
not
be
deni
even
presuppos
that
truth
may
not
be
deni
and
may
not
be
question
and
that
god
is
truth
it
onli
follow
that
god
may
not
be
deni
or
question
not
that
he
must
be
obey
we
could
unquestioningli
disobey
him
how
annoy
of
u
but
you
have
not
connect
denial
with
disobedi
dan
no
nicknam
johnson
and
god
said
jeez
thi
is
dull
and
it
wa
dull
genesi
these
opinion
probabl
show
what
i
know
