scott
munn
write
eventu
we
got
around
to
how
we
should
pray
in
jesu
name
then
an
excel
question
came
up
one
that
i
dont
have
a
real
answer
to
the
question
wa
if
we
need
to
pray
in
jesu
name
what
about
the
peopl
befor
jesu
they
pray
to
god
and
he
listen
then
in
spite
of
their
sin
whi
cant
it
be
the
same
way
now
and
in
that
day
you
will
ask
me
no
question
truli
truli
i
say
to
you
if
you
shall
ask
the
father
for
anyth
he
will
give
it
to
you
in
my
name
until
now
you
have
ask
for
noth
in
my
name
ask
and
you
will
receiv
that
your
joy
may
be
made
full
john
i
dont
believ
that
we
necessarili
have
to
say
in
christ
name
amen
for
our
prayer
to
be
heard
but
it
glorifi
the
son
when
we
acknowledg
that
our
prayer
is
made
possibl
by
him
i
believ
that
just
a
those
who
were
save
in
the
ot
could
onli
be
save
becaus
jesu
would
one
day
reconcil
god
to
man
he
is
the
onli
reason
their
prayer
would
be
heard
by
god
for
all
of
u
have
becom
like
one
who
is
unclean
and
all
our
righteou
deed
are
like
a
filthi
garment
and
all
of
u
wither
like
a
leaf
and
our
iniqu
like
the
wind
take
u
away
isaiah
na
our
prayer
like
the
rest
of
our
deed
are
too
unholi
to
go
directli
to
the
father
becaus
they
are
taint
by
our
sin
onli
by
wash
these
prayer
with
christ
blood
are
they
worthi
to
be
lift
to
to
the
father
first
i
thank
my
god
through
christ
jesu
roman
na
some
scholar
believ
that
thi
is
paul
recogn
that
even
hi
thank
are
too
unholi
for
the
father
basic
prayer
is
a
gift
of
grace
i
believ
that
onli
through
jesu
do
our
prayer
have
ani
power
thu
pray
in
hi
name
glorifi
and
prais
jesu
for
thi
beauti
and
power

he
ha
given

the
crown
and
chiefest
part
is
wisdom

apprentic
and
to
hold
god
in
awe
thi
is
the
law
