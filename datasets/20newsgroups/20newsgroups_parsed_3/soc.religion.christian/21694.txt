no
statement
by

is

me
that
the

pelopennesian
war
i
can
not

becaus
i
want
the
athenian

do
not
go

becaus
i
want
them
to
be
otherwis

sen
everi
statement
is
subject
to
privat
interpret
in
that
i
have
to
depend
on
my
brain
and
experei
to
decid
what
it
mean
and
whether
it
is
suffici
well
attest
to
merit
my
assent
even
if
the
statement
occur
in
an
inspir
write
i
still
have
to
decid
use
my
own
best
judgement
whether
it
is
in
fact
inspir
thi
is
not
arrog
it
is
just
an
inescap
fact
ye
there
are
these
two
sen
of
interpret
and
certainli
our
decis
to
accept
scriptur
a
inspir
ultim
rest
on
our
own
privat
opinion
howev
when
read
scriptur
we
have
to
rememb
that
the
scriptur
were
given
by
god
for
our
instruct
and
that
the
interpret
that
matter
is
the
one
god
intend
for
exampl
if
i
decid
that
the
fact
that
john
the
baptist
is
elijah
teach
the
doctrin
of
reincarn
i
am
wrong
becaus
that
is
not
the
intend
interpret
the
prophet
didnt
make
up
thi
teach
it
came
from
god
and
we
must
accept
it
a
such
thi
necessarili
mean
that
our
privat
interpret
must
take
a
back
seat
to
the
mean
god
intend
to
convey
certainli
we
must
reli
on
our
best
effort
to
determin
what
thi
mean
is
but
thi
veri
fact
should
make
u
recogn
that
our
privat
interpret
can
not
be
automat
accept
a
the
infal
interpret
of
god
we
need
to
test
the
spirit
to
see
if
they
are
from
god
when
the
holi
spirit
speak
he
say
the
same
thing
to
all
he
wont
tell
me
that
a
passag
mean
one
thing
and
tell
you
it
mean
anoth
if
the
two
of
u
come
to
conflict
conclus
we
cant
both
be
complet
right
we
know
our
interpret
are
reliabl
onli
when
the
church
a
a
whole
agre
on
what
scriptur
mean
thi
is
how
we
know
the
doctrin
of
the
triniti
the
dual
natur
of
christ
etc
infal
these
matter
are
not
up
for
privat
interpret
thi
is
the
reason
peter
goe
on
to
talk
about
the
decept
of
the
fals
teacher
they
prefer
their
own
privat
interpret
to
the
godgiven
teach
of
the
apostl
it
is
through
such
privat
interpret
that
the
tradit
of
men
so
soundli
denounc
