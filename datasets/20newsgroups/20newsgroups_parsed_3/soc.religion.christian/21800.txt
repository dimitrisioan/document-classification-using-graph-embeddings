subject
re
is
thi
ethic
just
a
quick
comment
a
a
baptist
clergyperson
i
find
the
idea
of
such
a
baptism
if
the
news
report
is
in
fact
accur
and
they
seldom
are
regard
religion
offens
the
pastor
here
seem
to
have
a
most
unbaptist
view
of
baptism
one
that
seem
to
demand
the
ceremoni
even
when
comprehens
and
choic
are
absent
we
do
baptiz
convert
but
no
one
who
ha
been
deceiv
into
hear
the
word
is
like
to
be
a
convert
if
in
fact
the
grace
of
god
might
work
in
such
a
situat
there
is
no
harm
done
in
wait
a
day
or
two
baptist
believ
in
regener
membership
did
thi
church
includ
these
halfbak
at
best
convert
into
their
church
fellowship
or
do
they
somehow
feel
there
is
some
valid
in
dunk
them
and
turn
them
loo
thi
kind
of
evangel
is
certainli
not
baptist
and
probabl
not
veri
christian
either
