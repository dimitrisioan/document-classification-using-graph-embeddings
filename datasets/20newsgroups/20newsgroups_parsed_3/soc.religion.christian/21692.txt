bodi
incid
ever
sinc

wa
a
kid
and

i
have
done
everyth
from

machinegun
zombi
not
to

myriad
sexual
fantasi
i
have
deliber
done
thing
that
i
would
never
do
in
real
life
i
understand
the
need
to
control
one
thought
but
i
alway
felt
that
dream
were
format
free
no
moral
no
ethic
no
physic
law
though
sometim
i
would
have
to
wake
myself
up
to
go
to
the
bathroom
is
thi
an
incorrect
attitud
rather
than
weaken
my
inhibit
i
could
argu
that
i
got
certain
thing
out
of
my
system
by
experienc
them
in
dream
by
analyz
a
dream
i
can
determin
if
i
have
a
problem
with
a
certain
situat
ie

be
exager
that
i
can

contempl
and
see

never
had
