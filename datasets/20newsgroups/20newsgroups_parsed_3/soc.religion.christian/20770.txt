are

or
paulin
both
sure
whi
not
but
are
you
use
paul
to
correct
the
word
of
jesu
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
what
is
sin
and
what
is
not
at
least
not
in
thi
case
jesu
did
not
deal
explicitli
with
the
question
of
whether
the
law
wa
bind
on
gentil
so
anyon
who
dissolv
even
one
of
the
smallest
command
and
teach
other
the
same
way
will
be
known
a
the
lowest
in
the
kingdom
of
the
sky
wherea
anyon
who
keep
the
command
and
teach
them
too
will
be
known
a
someon
great
in
the
kingdom
of
the
sky
mat
gau
are
you
an
anyon
or
are
you
a
no
one
whi
not
assum
that
sinc
jesu
didnt
say
that
hi
word
appli
onli
to
jew
that
they
appli
to
all
human
be
irregardless
of
race
or
sex
whi
not
assum
that
even
though
jesu
did
not
mention
your
name
still
jesu
wa
talk
directli
to
you
that
whi
i
have
to
cite
evid
such
a
the
way
jesu
dealt
with
the
centurion
a
to
gener
jewish
view
on
thi
i
am
depend
larg
on
studi
of
paulin
theolog
one
by
hj
schoep
and
one
whose
author
i
cant
come
up
with
at
the
moment
both
author
are
jew
also
variou
christian
and
nonchristian
jew
have
discus
the
issu
here
and
in
other
newsgroup
mat
is
clear
that
the
law
is
still
valid
it
doe
not
say
that
it
appli
to
gentil
doe
it
say
that
it
appli
to
you
are
you
anyon
or
no
one
and
ye
i
say
that
the
specif
requir
for
worship
on
the
sabbath
in
the
ten
command
is
a
ceremoni
detail
when
your
look
at
the
oblig
of
gentil
exjp
rememb
the
sabbath
day
and
keep
it
holi
six
day
you
shall
labor
and
do
all
your
work
but
the
seventh
day
is
a
sabbath
of
the
lord
your
god
you
shall
not
do
ani
work
you
your
son
or
daughter
your
male
or
femal
slave
or
your
cattl
or
the
stranger
who

your
settlement
for
in
six

the
lord
made
heaven
and
earth
and

and
all
that
is

seventh
day
therefor
the
lord

the
sabbath
day
and
hollow
it
note
there
is
no
specif
requir
for

here
howev
i
for
one

not
be
so
bold
a
to
call
these
vers
a
ceremoni
detail
similarli
circumcis
dont
mani
christian
still
practic
circumcis
im
not
sure
quit
what
el
i
can
say
on
thi
subject
again
it
unfortun
the
jesu
didnt
answer
the
question
directli
it
unfortun
that
jesu
didnt
use
your
name
directli
or
mayb
jesu
did
are
you
somebodi
or
nobodi
howev
we
do
know
what
the
st
cent
jewish
approach
wa
how
jesu
dealt
with
at
least
one
gentil
and
how
jesu
discipl
dealt
with
the
issu
when
it
becam
more
acut
im
refer
to
act
more
than
paul
given
that
these
are
all
in
agreement
i
dont
see
that
there
a
big
problem
if
you
dont
see
a
problem
then
perhap
there
is
none
a
paul
close
roman
gau
in
short
pursu
the
end
of
peac
and
of
build
each
other
up
dont
let
dietari
consider
undo
the
work
of
god
everyth
may
be
clean
but
it
evil
for
the
person
who
eat
it
in
an
offens
spirit
better
not
to
eat
the
meat
or
drink
the
wine
or
whatev
el
your
brother
is
offend
by
a
for
the
faith
that
you
have
keep
that
between
yourself
and
god
the
person
is
in
luck
who
doesnt
condemn
himself
for
what
he
sampl
on
the
other
hand
the
person
with
doubt
about
someth
who
eat
it
anyway
is
guilti
becaus
he
isnt
act
on
