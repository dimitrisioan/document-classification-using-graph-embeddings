subject
re
homosexu
issu
in
christian
can
someon
cite
biblic
refer
to
homosexu
be
immor
other
than
leviticu
so
far
when
i
ask
around
here
i
get
the
vers
from
leviticu
spout
at
me
but
the
whole
rest
of
that
book
tend
to
be
ignor
by
christian
havent
seen
ani
stone
in
a
long
time
later
max
bob
muir
the
list
wa
post
not
long
ago
a
i
recal
asid
from
lev
commonli
cite
passag
are
the
stori
of
sodom
note
howev
that
thi
wa
a
homosexu
rape
and
there
no
disagr
that
that
is
wrong
i
take
an
intermedi
posit
on
thi
note
that
sodom
is
refer
to
elsewher
in
the
bibl
for
it
sin
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
known
specif
for
homosexu
rather
i
think
it
wa
consid
a
cesspool
of
all
sin
howev
from
what
we
know
of
jewish
attitud
homosexu
would
have
contribut
to
the
horror
of
the
action
describ
it
almost
seem
to
have
been
contriv
to
combin
about
a
mani
form
of
evil
in
one
act
a
possibl
homosexu
rape
of
guest
who
were
actual
angel
but
thi
stori
is
not
specif
about
homosexu
in
the
nt
the
clear
refer
are
all
from
paul
letter
in
rom
there
is
a
passag
that
presuppos
that
homosexu
is
an
evil
note
that
the
passag
isnt
about
homosexu
it
about
idolatri
homosexu
is
visit
on
peopl
a
a
punish
or
at
least
result
of
idolatri
there
are
a
number
of
argument
over
thi
passag
it
doe
not
use
the
word
homosexu
and
it
is
refer
to
peopl
who
are
by
natur
heterosexu
practic
homosexu
so
it
not
what
id
call
an
explicit
teach
against
all
homosexu
but
it
doe
seem
to
support
what
would
be
a
natur
assumpt
anyway
that
paul
share
the
gener
neg
jewish
attitud
toward
homosexu
the
other
passag
occur
in
list
of
sin
in
i
cor
and
i
tim
unfortun
it
not
entir
clear
what
the
word
use
here
mean
there
have
been
suggest
that
one
ha
a
broader
mean
such
a
wanton
and
that
anoth
may
be
specif
male
prostitut
again
we
dont
have
here
a
precis
teach
about
homosexu
but
it
is
at
least
weak
support
evid
that
paul
share
the
ot
neg
judgement
on
homosexu
jude
is
sometim
cite
howev
it
probabl
not
relev
the
context
in
jude
involv
angel
sinc
those
who
were
almost
rape
in
sodom
were
angel
it
seem
like
that
strang
flesh
refer
to
intercours
with
angel
a
you
can
see
the
nt
evid
is
such
that
peopl
conclus
is
determin
by
their
approach
to
the
bibl
conserv
note
that
the
passag
from
paul
letter
impli
that
he
accept
the
ot
prohibit
thi
is
enough
for
them
to
regard
it
a
have
nt
endors
liber
note
that
there
no
specif
teach
and
no
clear
definit
of
what
is
be
prohibit
or
whi
is
the
concern
in
rom
the
connect
of
homosexu
to
pagan
worship
what
exactli
do
the
word
in
the
list
of
sin
mean
thu
some
believ
it
is
legitim
to
regard
thi
a
a
attitud
paul
took
with
him
from
hi
background
and
not
a
specif
teach
of
the
gospel
thi
is
an
explos
topic
which
tend
to
result
in
long
dissert
on
the
exact
mean
of
variou
greek
word
but
it
clear
to
me
that
that
mostli
irrelev
what
it
realli
come
down
to
is
whether
peopl
are
look
to
the
bibl
for
law
or
whether
they
believ
that
such
a
approach
is
inconsist
with
the
gospel
thi
appear
to
depend
upon
one
reaction
to
the
messag
of
the
bibl
a
a
whole
a
well
a
one
percept
of
the
need
of
the
church
today
thi
is
a
differ
of
approach
at
least
a
seriou
a
the
differ
between
protest
and
cathol
in
the
th
cent
and
one
where
both
side
believ
that
the
bibl
is
so
obvious
on
their
side
that
they
keep
think
all
they
have
to
do
is
quot
a
few
more
passag
and
the
other
side
will
final
come
to
their
sen
that
make
thing
veri
frustrat
for
a
moder
who
realiz
that
such
an
optimist
outcom
is
