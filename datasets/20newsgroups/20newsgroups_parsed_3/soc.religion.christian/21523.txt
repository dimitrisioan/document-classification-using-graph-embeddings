write
i
would
say
onli
to
the
extent
that
the
roman
cathol
church
neither
approv
nor
disapprov
of
capit
punish
a
confirm
in
the
recent
catech
though
there
are
mani
rc
who
were
rather
surpris
and
upset
that
capit
punish
wa
not
explicitli
condemn
i
quot
from
the
journal
day
in
the
church
and
in
the
world
no
p

the
new
draft
of
the
univers
catech
in
procur
the
common
good
of

the
need
could
aris
that
the

where
he
can
not
caus

have
the
right
to

with
the
use

the

tradit
teach
ha
alway
been
express
and
will
continu
to
be
express
in
the
consider

to
the
degre
that

other

penalti

suffici

then
these

are
to
be
prefer
becaus
they
are
more

with
the
final
goal
of

is
clearli
shown

thi
excerpt
the
church
teach
on
capit
punish
remain
today
a
it
ha
alway
been
in
the
past
in
total
accord
with
my
sentiment
that
i
do
not
disagre
with
the
use
of
deadli
forc
in
those
case
for

thi
option
is
justifi
i
do
not
think
your

can
automat
be
taken
a
support
for
capit
punish
i
take
it
that
a
a

you
are
oppos
to
abort
and
would
still
onsid
it
wrong

someth
to
