mani
christian
believ
in
abstin
but
in
a
moment
will
be
overcom
by
desir
we
all
compromis
and
ration
poor
choic
sin
last
week
i
wa
guilti
of
anger
jealousi
and
whole
mess
of
other
stuff
yet
i
am
forgiven
and
not
condemn
to
suffer
with
aid
to
even
suggest
that
aid
is
deserv
is
ludicr
when
man
wa
told
not
to
have
sex
with
rel
did
they
listen
no
and
man
found
out
whi
so
what
your
point
mark
comment
still
is
valid
to
suggest
that
aid
is
deserv
is
ludicr
i
sin
i
can
resolv
to
abstain
from
sin
and
do
weekli
more
often
actual
yet
i
routin
fail
i
sure
do
deserv
what
i
get
yet
god
compassion
provid
the
incarn
logo
jesu
a
a
rememdi
and
a
way
out
of
our
situat
if
aid
is
deserv
i
sure
deserv
instant
death
just
a
much
a
do
we
all
a
st
paul
so
cogent
remid
u
to
willingli
judg
other
a
deserv
punish
seem
to
me
to
be
the
height
of
arrog
and
lack
of
humil
i
wonder
if
aid
would
be
a
problem
now
if
peopl
didnt
get
involv
in
deviant
sexual
behaviour
certainli
peopl
who
receiv
taint
blood
are
not
to
blame
but
it
just
goe
to
show
that
all
mankind
is
affect
by
the
action
of
a
few
so
what
the
point
here
i
can
get
aid
and
never
engag
in
deviant
sexual
behavior
in
fact
i
could
engag
in
lot
of
deviant
sexual
behavior
with
hiv
peopl
and
never
be
infect
aid
is
a
consequ
of
particular
behavior
mani
of
which
are
not
sexual
and
not
all
sexual
behavior
carri
the
risk
of
transmiss
in
addit
imho
forgiv
is
not
the
end
of
thing
there
is
still
the
matter
of
aton
is
it
aid
i
dont
know
the
end
of
all
thing
is
to
know
love
and
serv
god
grow
daili
closer
through
prayer
medit
and
disciplin
even
so
i
could
get
aid
anyon
could
unless
they
remain
