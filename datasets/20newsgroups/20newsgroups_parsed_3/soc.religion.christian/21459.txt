besid
i
would
rather
spend
an
etern
in
hell
than
be
besid
god
in
heaven
know
even
one
man
would
spend
hi
etern
life
be
scorch
for
hi
wrongdo
thi
display
of
bravado
is
no
bluff
ive
no
fear
ani
god
or
hi
punish
that
wa
my
point
if
i
play
poker
with
monopoli
money
i
can
bet
anyth
i
want
but
i
shant
go
to
heaven
it
would
be
against
my
sen
of
human
and
compass
for
my
fellow
man
thi
is
exactli
whi
christian
is
missionari
in
natur
not
just
out
of
a
need
to
irrit
the
god
of
both
testament
are
one
and
the
same
and
in
neither
is
there
evid
god
is
strictli
love
to
the
peopl
who
wrote
the
bibl
and
to
whom
the
bibl
is
written
there
is
evid
of
love
but
that
is
a
cultur
bia
thi
is
a
poor
answer
which
you
neednt
rebut
i
will
now
pull
the
old
bait
and
switch
i
think
you
should
use
the
bibl
to
judg
man
not
god
by
that
i
mean
if
your
moral
intuit
doesnt
like
what
is
describ
in
the
bibl
realiz
that
such
thing
are
go
on
now
i
will
avoid
the
semant
argument
about
the
caus
of
evil
and
ask
what
are
you
do
to
fight
it
not
you
specif
but
everyon
includ
myself
if
i
dont
like
the
genocid
in
the
bibl
what
about
the
genocid
that
goe
on
right
now
to
move
beyond
the
question
of
a
hell
realiz
that
mani
peopl
right
now
are
suffer
if
you
think
hell
isnt
fair
and
are
will
to
sacrific
everyth
just
to
deni
it
exist
what
about
how
life
isnt
fair
right
now
there
is
a
young
mother
with
three
littl
kid
who
doesnt
know
how
she
will
get
through
the
day
right
now
there
is
a
sixth
grader
who
is
a
junki
right
now
there
is
an
old
man
with
no
friend
and
no
money
to
fix
hi
tv
instead
of
whi
doesnt
god
help
them
ask
whi
dont
we
help
them
i
think
you
are
correct
to
challeng
ani
christian
who
doesnt
live
hi
life
with
the
compass
you
seem
to
posse
you
want
evid
of
god
find
someon
who
is
make
a
differ
someon
you
admir
someon
who
ha
been
through
some
tough
time
and
ha
come
out
with
hi
head
up
ask
the
person
how
he
doe
it
ask
the
vietnam
vet
who
wa
battl
medic
how
he
kept
hi
mind
ask
the
woman
who
wa
pregnant
at
kept
the
babi
and
now
is
a
success
busi
woman
ask
the
doctor
who
ha
oper
on
a
pound
babi
they
wont
all
be
christian
or
even
what
you
might
call
religi
but
there
will
be
someth
in
common
god
is
not
defin
in
the
bibl
god
is
defin
by
what
is
in
those
peopl
heart
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
cant
give
intellectu
assent
to
ani
descript
youv
heard
theyr
all
wrong
anyway
the
compass
you
alreadi
feel
in
your
heart
is
a
step
in
the
right
direct
follow
that
instead
then
come
back
and
read
the
bibl
and
youll
see
that
same
thing
describ
there
if
noth
el
make
sen
hang
on
to
that
idea
that
god
is
love
i
would
say
someth
similar
but
in
revers
order
love
is
god
good
i
guess
we
onli
have
