desire
bradley
write
i
must
have
miss
the
post
about
waco
david
koresh
and
the
second
come
how
doe
one
tell
if
a
second
come
is
the
real
thing
unless
the
person
claim
to
be
it
is
obvious
insan
first
by
hi
fruit
the
messiah
come
to
build
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
the
earth
he
also
come
to
first
reveal
the
root
caus
of
origin
sin
fallen
natur
and
then
provid
a
mean
to
cut
the
connect
to
that
origin
sin
he
also
want
to
creat
world
peac
base
on
godism
the
messiah
teach
will
build
on
the
foundat
of
the
bibl
but
provid
profound
new
insight
into
the
natur
of
god
the
fall
of
man
the
purpos
of
creation
and
god
provid
of
restor
it
will
also
provid
a
foundat
for
the
uniti
of
all
the
world
religion
mani
christian
expect
jesu
to
come
on
liter
cloud
so
they
may
miss
him
when
he
return
just
a
the
jewish
peopl
miss
jesu
year
ago
they
are
still
wait
for
hi
first
come
the
jewish
peopl
of
that
age
expect
elijah
to
come
first
jesu
said
that
john
the
baptist
wa
elijah
but
john
the
baptist
deni
that
he
wa
elijah
how
did
thi
reflect
on
jesu
later
in
prison
john
even
question
who
jesu
wa
is
he
the
one
who
is
to
come
or
do
we
look
for
anoth
see
book
of
matthew
im
not
say
that
david
koresh
is
the
second
come
of
christ
how
could
somebodi
who
break
hi
word
be
the
second
come
koresh
did
promis
that
he
would
come
out
of
hi
compound
if
onli
he
wa
allow
to
give
a
radio
broadcast
he
didnt
still
it
seem
to
me
that
he
did
fool
some
peopl
david
koresh
didnt
even
come
close
the
problem
is
that
peopl
like
thi
make
it
difficult
for
peopl
to
believ
and
trust
in
the
real
messiah
when
he
doe
show
up
and
from
my
meagr
knowledg
of
the
bibl
it
seem
that
christian
have
been
hard
on
the
jew
of
christ
day
for
be
cautiou
about
accept
somebodi
that
their
religi
author
didnt
accept
a
the
messiah
so
i
wa
surpris
that
nobodi
had
discuss
the
difficulti
of
want
to
be
earli
to
recogn
the
second
come
while
at
the
same
time
not
want
to
be
credul
believ
just
anybodi
who
claim
to
be
god
veri
good
point
and
perhap
the
most
import
point
of
all
for
christian
how
to
recogn
the
second
come
the
messiah
should
not
claim
to
be
god
what
set
a
messiah
apart
is
that
he
is
born
without
origin
sin
he
is
not
born
perfect
but
achiev
perfect
after
a
period
of
growth
adam
and
eve
were
born
sinless
but
they
fell
and
thi
tragedi
meant
that
it
would
take
god
thousand
of
year
to
creat
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
the
earth
a
god
origin
intend
god
restor
provid
is
still
not
complet
the
messiah
is
the
true
son
of
god
one
with
god
god
repres
on
the
earth
but
not
god
himself
there
is
onli
one
god
mark
and
then
if
ani
one
say
to
you
look
here
is
the
christ
or
look
there
he
is
do
not
believ
it
mark
and
then
they
will
see
the
son
of
man
come
in
cloud
with
great
power
and
glori
my
understand
of
jesu
answer
is
that
unlik
hi
first
come
which
wa
veil
the
second
come
will
be
quit
unmistak
by
the
way
from
koresh
public
statement
it
not
so
clear
to
me
that
he
is
claim
to
be
christ
who
els
in
thi
world
is
claim
to
be
the
messiah
mayb
he
alreadi
here
