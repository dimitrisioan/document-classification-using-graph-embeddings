peter
one
interpret
ive
heard
of
thi
vers
is
that
it
refer
to
the
sin
of
physic
abus
one
wife
the
husband
is
usual
physic
stronger
than
hi
wife
but
is
not
permit
to
use
thi
to
domin
her
he
must
honor
her
a
hi
sister
in
christ
thi
would
therefor
be
an
exampl
of
a
specif
sin
that

i
would
be
a
bit
more
specif
in
look
at
thi
vers
in
regard
to
block
prayer
i
have
troubl
think
that
god
would
allow
anyth
to
block
our
access
to
him
in
prayer
especi
if
we
have
sin
and
are
pray
for
forgivenenss
i
can
see
howev
how
our
prayer
life
might
be
hinder
by
our
sin
if
we
are
concentr
on
what
is
caus
the
sin
or
what
ha
happen
we
may
not
be
think
about
prayer
thu
our
prayer
are
hinder
by
our
own
action
but
i
dont
think
anyth
can
block
the
transmiss
or
recept
of
prayer
to
god
