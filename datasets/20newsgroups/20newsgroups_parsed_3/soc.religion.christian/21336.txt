gerri
palo
write
there
is
noth
in
christian
that
preclud
the
idea
of
repeat
live
on
earth
the
apostl
paul
roman
point
out
that
god
chose
jacob
rather
than
esau
to
be
the
ancestor
of
the
coven
peopl
and
ultim
of
the
messiah
and
that
he
made
thi
choic
while
the
two
boy
were
still
in
their
mother
womb
and
therefor
could
not
possibl
have
done
anyth
good
or
evil
to
deserv
their
appoint
destini
if
we
admit
the
possibl
that
they
had
live
previou
live
and
that
in
accord
with
the
asiat
idea
of
karma
their
present
live
are
a
reward
or
punish
for
past
behaviour
thi
make
nonsens
of
paul
whole
point
the
exist
of
repeat
earth
live
and
destini
karma
doe
not
mean
that
everyth
that
happen
is
predetermin
by
past
deed
there
is
an
orient
view
of
it
that
tend
in
that
direct
but
i
did
not
subscrib
to
that
view
god
may
choos
one
individu
over
anoth
a
the
fit
instrument
for
hi
plan
but
that
doe
not
preclud
that
the
develop
of
that
individu
into
what
he
is
in
thi
earthli
life
is
not
the
result
of
a
longer
cours
of
develop
i
do
not
and
rudolf
steiner
did
not
subscrib
to
the
orient
view
of
an
inexor
mechanist
karma
determin
everyth
that
befal
one
thi
is
a
kind
of
shrivel
caricatur
of
a
much
greater
law
in
the
context
of
which
the
deed
of
christ
on
golgotha
and
the
ultim
salvat
and
freedom
of
the
human
be
a
a
work
of
christ
can
be
seen
a
the
master
theme
and
inde
a
new
impuls
that
wa
complet
free
of
karma
christ
incarn
onli
onc
in
the
flesh
and
in
that
he
had
no
debt
of
karma
or
sin
the
orient
concept
of
reincarn
and
karma
which
are
even
more
trivial
and
mechan
in
some
new
age
teach
incorrectli
assum
jesu
christ
to
have
been
the
reincarn
of
a
master
avatar
etc
their
teach
of
reincarn
and
karma
also
ha
no
concept
the
continu
individu
from
one
life
to
the
next
eg
buddhism
more
import
they
have
no
concept
of
the
resurrect
of
the
bodi
the
ultim
continu
of
the
whole
human
be
to
ultim
resurrect
and
judgement
on
the
last
day
there
is
anoth
biblic
passag
that
also
ha
a
bear
it
is
the
tenth
chapter
of
john
devot
almost
entir
to
the
man
born
blind
clearli
here
jesu
tell
the
discipl
that
it
wa
not
hi
past
karma
or
that
of
hi
parent
that
led
to
hi
blind
but
rather
that
a
new
impuls
is
to
be
reveal
through
him
but
note
that
he
doe
not
refut
the
discipl
question
in
fact
they
ask
it
a
a
matter
of
cours
the
question
be
state
a
if
it
were
self
evid
that
onli
one
of
two
possibl
exist
it
wa
either
the
sin
of
the
man
himself
obvious
not
in
thi
incarn
or
the
sin
of
hi
parent
the
fact
that
they
even
ask
about
the
first
possibl
at
all
indic
an
awar
of
the
idea
on
their
part
and
the
form
of
christ
answer
indic
that
he
did
not
disagre
with
it
there
is
also
matthew
where
jesu
say
straight
out
about
john
the
baptist
if
you
care
to
accept
it
he
himself
is
elia
who
wa
to
come
thi
also
emphas
that
the
gospel
do
not
have
a
posit
teach
either
way
about
reincarn
or
in
fact
about
what
happen
to
the
human
be
at
all
between
death
and
the
last
day
even
jesu
did
not
push
thi
teach
on
peopl
who
were
not
readi
to
embrac
it
if
you
care
to
accept
it
so
i
took
care
to
point
out
not
that
the
bibl
teach
reincarn
but
that
it
doe
not
deni
it
either
and
that
much
in
both
scriptur
and
fundament
christian
doctrin
becom
understand
if
reincarn
is
understood
in
the
right
way
i
pointedli
use
repeat
earth
live
to
distinguish
a
littl
from
the
orient
doctrin
usual
associ
with
the
word
reincarn
the
phrase
is
rudolf

too
that
the
