to
man
exist
when
you
say
that
man
is
onli
an
anim
i
have
to
think
that
you
are
present
an
unprov
statement
a
dogma
if
you
will
and
one
the
requir
a
kind
of
faith
too
by
take
such
a
hard
line
in
your
atheism
you
may
have
stumbl
into
a

a
far
a
we
can
tell

the
mammal
catagori
now
if
there
were
someth
more
to
the

say
a

hope
youll
do
a
littl
research
into
it
histori
and
varieti
perhap
by
read
paul
johnson
a
histori
of
christian
from
your
remark
it
seem
that
you
have
been
expos
to
certain
type
of
christian
religion
and
not
other
even
an
atheist
should
have
enough
faith
in
man
to
know
that
a
movement
of
year
ha
to
have
some
depth
and
be
anim
by
some
endur
valu
well
then
buddhism
confucian
taoism
hinduism
judaism
zoeraster
shintoism
and
islam
should
fit
thi
bit
of
logic
quit
nice
all
have

all
