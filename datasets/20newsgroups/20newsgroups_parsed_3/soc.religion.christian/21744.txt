incred
pervers
interpret
in
order
to

a
condemn

the
kind
of
interpret
i
see
a
incred
pervers
is
that
appli
to
the
stori
of
sodom
a
if
it
were
a
blanket
equat
of
homosexu
behavior
and
rape
sinc
christian
cite
the
bibl
in
such
a
context
should
be
presum
to
have
at
least
read
the
stori
it
amount
to
slander
a
charg
that
homosexu
rape
to
use
that
against
u
the
stori
in
genesi
tell
of
the
citizen
of
sodom
demand
an
opportun
to
know
the
two
men
who
were
lot
guest
the
fact
that
the
sodomit
becam
angri
when
lot
offer
them
hi
daughter
could
be
seen
a
indic
that
they
were
interest
onli
in
homosexu
intercours
ye
what
they
want
wa
rape
homosexu
rape
and
everybodi
agre
that
that
is
wrong
some
christian
believ
that
the
homosexu
aspect
of
their
desir
wa
just
a
sin
a
the
rape
aspect
of
their
desir
the
passag
doe
not
say
what
it
wa
that
so
offend
god
whether
it
wa
the
homosexu
or
the
intend
rape
or
both
but
i
believ
that
it
is
onli
fair
to
consid
all
the
possibl
altern
in
the
light
of
relat
scriptur
i
do
not
believ
that
those
who
believ
god
wa
offend
by
both
the
homosexu
and
the
rape
are
tri
to
say
that
homosexu
is
itself
a
form
of
rape
you
seem
to
take
the
view
that
the
onli
sin
describ
in
gen
is
in
the
fact
that
the
sodomit
want
to
commit
rape
and
that
it
is
unfair
to
stigmat
their
homosexu
by
associ
it
with
the
sin
of
rape
i
can
see
how
you
might
reach
such
a
conclus
if
you
start
from
the
conclus
that
there
is
noth
wrong
with
homosexu
but
then
again
were
not
suppos
to
start
from
our
conclus
becaus
that
circular
reason
if
god
is
in
fact
oppos
to
homosexu
intercours
in
gener
then
the
more
probabl
interpret
is
that
he
wa
at
least
a
offend
by
the
sodomit
blatant
homosexu
a
he
wa
by
their
intent
to
commit
rape
later
on
i
will
document
whi
i
believ
the
old
testament
portray
god
a
one
who
despis
ani
homosexu
intercours
even
if
both
partner
are
consent
adult
do
not
be
deceiv
neither
fornic
nor
idol
nor
adulter
nor
effemin
nor
homosexu
nor
thiev
nor
the
covet
nor
drunkard
nor
revil
nor
swindler
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
and
such
were
some
of
you
i
cor
the
moder
adequ
discus
the
circular
of
your
use
of
porneia
in
thi
the
moder
found
my
propos
to
be
circular
in
that
he
regard
the
church
a
the
proper
author
for
determin
what
kind
of
marriag
would
be
legitim
and
thu
the
church
refus
to
recogn
pervert
marriag
wa
circular
reason
my
question
howev
had
noth
to
do
with
the
church
ordain
new
kind
of
marriag
and
so
hi
argument
wa
someth
of
a
straw
man
in
term
of
my
origin
question
the
precis
definitiontransl
of
porneia
isnt
realli
import
unless
you
are
tri
to
argu
that
the
bibl
doesnt
realli
condemn
extramarit
sex
im
not
sure
the
moder
wa
tri
to
do
that
in
ani
case
i
think
both
you
and
the
moder
have
miss
the
point
here
when
jesu
wa
ask
about
divorc
he
repli
have
you
not
read
that
he
who
creat
them
from
the
begin
made
them
male
and
femal
and
said
for
thi
caus
a
man
shall
leav
hi
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleav
to
hi
wife
and
the
two
shall
becom
one
flesh
consequ
they
are
no
longer
two
but
one
flesh
what
therefor
god
ha
join
togeth
let
no
man
separ
mt
i
read
here
that
the
sexual
union
of
a
man
male
and
hi
wife
femal
is
a
divinelyordain
union
in
other
word
the
institut
of
heterosexu
marriag
is
someth
ordain
and
establish
by
godnot
by
men
and
not
by
the
church
but
by
god
men
are
not
suppos
to
dissolv
thi
union
in
jesu
word
becaus
it
is
not
someth
creat
by
men
thi
is
not
circular
reason
thi
is
just
read
god
word
i
read
in
the
bibl
that
god
ordain
the
union
of
male
and
femal
i
do
not
read
of
ani
similar
divinelyordain
union
of
two
male
or
two
femal
grant
there
have
been
uninspir
men
who
have
ordain
altern
union
isnt
caligula
report
to
have
marri
hi
hors
but
the
onli
union
that
jesu
refer
to
a
what
god
ha
join
togeth
is
the
heterosexu
union
of
a
man
and
hi
wife
pardon
me
for
mention
caligula
i
know
that
probabl
inflammatori
and
i
should
save
it
for
the
discus
on
bestial
in
part
of
thi
post
plea
hold
off
on
pas
judgement
on
me
until
you
have
read
that
section
of
my
repli
anyway
my
origin
question
wa
not
whether
we
should
translat
porneia
in
a
way
that
condemn
onli
a
select
few
kind
of
extramarit
sex
my
question
wa
given
that
heterosexu
marriag
is
the
onli
union
describ
by
the
bibl
a
divinelyordain
and
given
a
biblic
prohibit
against
sex
outsid
of
marriag
is
homosexu
intercours
sin
of
cours
i
see
now
that
first
we
need
to
ask
whether
the
bibl
realli
condemn
sex
outsid
of
marriag
you
seem
to
be
tri
to
argu
that
onli
certain
kind
of
extramarit
sex
and
other
sin
are
realli
wrong
i
think
we
can
all
agre
with
paul
that
there
are
some
kind
of
activ
that
could
be
name
by
fornic
or
theft
or
covet
or
revil
or
drunken
which
would
well
deserv
condemn
we
may
or
may
not
agre
to
the
bound
of
those
categori
howev
and
the
veri
fact
that
they
are
argu
over
suggest
that
not
onli
is
the
matter
not
at
all
clear
but
that
paul
an
excel
rhetorician
had
no
interest
in
make
them
clear
leav
matter
rather
to
our
spiritl
decis
with
all
the
uncomfort
livingwithotherread
that
ha
domin
christian
discus
of
all
these
area
altern
it
may
be
that
the
definit
of
such
term
a
porneia
and
all
the
rest
wa
in
paul
day
what
we
would
call
a
faq
ie
the
law
a
the
tutor
appoint
by
god
to
lead
u
to
christ
had
just
spent
some
sixteen
centuri
drum
into
the
head
of
god
peopl
the
idea
that
thing
like
homosexu
intercours
were
abomin
that
deserv
punish
by
death
perhap
paul
didnt
go
into
detail
on
what
porneia
c
were
becaus
after
year
he
consid
the
question
to
have
been
dealt
with
alreadi
perhap
the
reason
god
apostl
and
prophet
did
not
devot
a
great
deal
of
time
defin
a
distinct
new
testament
sexual
wa
becaus
he
did
not
intend
ani
signific
chang
in
the
sexual
he
had
alreadi
establish
by
the
law
ill
discus
the
law
and
homosexu
in
greater
detail
below
but
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
new
testament
failur
to
develop
a
detail
new
standard
of
sexual
is
not
necessarili
evid
that
god
doe
not
care
about
sexual
conductespeci
after
year
of
put
peopl
to
death
for
practic
homosexu
homosexu
behavior
is
no
differ
i
and
the
other
gay
christian
i
know
are
adam
in
condemn
rape
heterosexu
or
homosexu
and
child
molest
heterosexu
or
homosexu
and
even
the
possibl
harmless
but
ob
kind
of
sex
heterosexu
or
homosexu
that
would
stand
condemn
by
paul
in
the
veri
continu
of
the
chapter
you
cite
may
i
mildli
suggest
that
what
paul
doe
in
hi
letter
that
you
want
to
use
is
perhap
a
good
guid
to
hi
mean
i
am
free
to
do
anyth
you
say
ye
but
not
everyth
is
for
my
good
no
doubt
i
am
free
to
do
anyth
but
i
for
one
will
not
let
anyth
make
free
with
me
cor
which
is
a
restat
that
we
must
have
no
other
god
befor
god
a
command
neither
i
nor
ani
other
gay
christian
wish
to
break
some
peopl
are
inde
involv
in
ob
driven
mode
of
sexual
behavior
it
is
just
a
wrong
though
slightli
le
incendiari
so
it
a
secondari
argument
from
the
phobic
conting
to
equat
homosexu
with
such
behavior
a
to
equat
it
with
the
rape
of
god
messeng
and
how
do
you
defin
an
ob
driven
mode
of
sexual
behavior
how
do
you
determin
the
differ
between
ob
sexual
behavior
and
normal
sex
drive
is
the
desir
to
have
sin
sex
an
ob
driven
mode
of
behavior
i
think
you
see
that
thi
is
circular
reason
whi
is
it
defin
a
sin
becaus
it
is
ob
what
make
it
ob
the
fact
that
the
person
is
driven
to
seek
it
even
though
it
sin
or
is
it
ob
becaus
it
is
a
desir
for
that
which
societi
condemn
onc
again
that
circular
whi
is
it
defin
a
ob
becaus
the
person
want
it
even
though
societi
condemn
it
whi
doe
societi
condemn
it
becaus
it
is
ob
you
seem
to
be
tri
to
limit
the
bibl
condemn
of
porneia
to
onli
pervert
sex
act
but
i
dont
think
you
can
realli
defin
pervert
without
fall
into
exactli
the
same
circular
you
accus
me
of
what
then
is
paul
condemn
when
he
declar
that
fornicatorsshal
not
enter
the
kindgom
of

i
wont
deal
with
the
exegesi
of

except

fundament
you
are
exhibit
the
same
circular
here
a
in
your
assumpt
that
you
know
what
porneia
mean
i
think
you
misunderstood
me
i
wa
not
tri
to
make
an
argument
on
some
technic
definit
of
porneia
i
wa
rais
the
issu
of
the
sin
of
extramarit
sex
and
the
lack
of
ani
scriptur
evid
of
a
homosexu
counterpart
to
the
divinelyordain
union
of
heterosexu
coupl
there
are
plenti
of
law
prohibit
sexual
behavior
to
be
found
in
leviticu
most
of
which
christian
ignor
complet
they
never
even
bother
to
examin
them
they
just
assum
that
they
know
which
one
are
moral
and
which
one
are
ritual
well
i
have
news
for
you
ani
anthropolog
cours
should
sensit
you
to
ritual
and
clean
v
unlcean
a
categori
in
an
aw
lot
of
societi
we
have
them
too
but
buri
pretti
deep
and
i
can
not
see
ani
ground
for
distinguish
these
bit
of
leviticu
from
the
ritual
law
which
no
christian
i
know
feel
appli
to
u
im
dead
seriou
here
when
peopl
start
go
on
a
they
do
in
thi
matter
about
how
repuls
and
unnatur
our
act
are
and
what
do
they
know
about
it
huh
it
is
a
solid
clue
to
the
same
sort
of
arbitrari
cultur
inculc
a
the
american
prejudic
against
eat
insect
plea
rememb
what
you
just
said
here
for
when
we
discus
bestial
in
part
on
what
basi
other
than
assum
your
conclus
can
you
say
that
the
law
against
malemal
intercours
in
leviticu
is
not
a
part
of
the
ritual
law
i
am
glad
you
ask
would
you
agre
that
if
god
condemn
homosexu
intercours
even
among
those
who
are
not
under
the
law
of
mose
then
thi
would
show
that
god
condemn
of
homosexu
act
goe
beyond
the
ritual
law
if
i
can
show
you
from
scriptur
that
god
punish
the
homosexu
behavior
of
peopl
who
were
not
under
the
law
of
mose
would
you
agre
that
god
definit
of
homosexu
intercours
a
an
abomin
is
not
limit
to
just
the
ritual
law
and
those
who
are
under
the
law
ive
been
have
a
privat
email
discus
with
a
th
day
adventist
on
the
subject
of
the
sabbath
and
my
main
point
against
a
christian
sabbathkeep
requir
ha
been
that
nowher
in
scriptur
doe
god
command
gentil
to
rest
on
the
sabbath
nor
doe
he
ever
condemn
gentil
for
fail
to
rest
on
the
sabbath
thi
illustr
the
differ
between
univers
requir
such
a
thou
shalt
not
kill
and
requir
that
are
mere
part
of
the
temporari
jewsonli
law
of
mose
such
a
the
sabbath
the
point
you
are
tri
to
make
is
that
you
think
the
classif
of
homosexu
intercours
a
an
abomin
is
just
a
part
of
the
temporari
jewsonli
law
of
mose
i
on
the
other
hand
believ
that
it
wa
label
by
god
a
an
abomin
for
gentil
a
well
a
jew
and
that
he
punish
those
guilti
of
thi
behavior
by
death
or
exil
here
whi
back
in
genesi
god
promis
to
give
abraham
all
the
land
that
wa
then
in
the
posse
of
the
amoritekinda
hard
on
the
amorit
dont
you
think
but
in
vers
we
have
a
clue
that
thi
might
not
be
a
unjust
a
it
sound
it
seem
god
is
go
to
postpon
thi
takeov
for
quit
a
while
becaus
the
iniqu
of
the
amorit
is
not
yet
complet
rememb
thi
is
all
long
befor
there
wa
a

it

for

i
conclud
that

not
base
on

on
