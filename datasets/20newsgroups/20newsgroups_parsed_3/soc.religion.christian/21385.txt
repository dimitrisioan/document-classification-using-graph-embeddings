to
our
neighbour
do
good
to
all
men
gal
love
our
neighbour
a
ourselv
matt
act
the
part
of
the
good
samaritan
luke
toward
ani
who
may
be
in
troubl
we
will
therefor
render
everi
possibl
assist
to
an
injur
man
and
therefor
should
not
be
part
of
ani
organis
which
caus
peopl
harm
even
medic
corp
of
the
armi
etc
christian
are
by
faith
citizen
of
the
commonwealth
of
israel
ephesian
and
also
recognis
that
god
rule
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
therefor
we
should
not
be
take
part
in
ani
of
the
struggl
of
those
nation
which
we
are
not
part
of
due
to
our
faith
we
are
to
be
stranger
and
pilgrim
amongst
the
nation
so
we
are
just
pas
through
and
not
part
of
ani
nation
or
ani
nation
aspir
thi
can
also
be
appli
to
polit
etc
but
that
anoth
stori
we
are
not
suppos
to
strive
or
resist
evil
even
suffer
yourselv
to
be
defraud
it
is
therefor
incosist
for
u
to
strive
to
assist
in
preserv
a
state
which
christ
will
destroy
when
he
return
to
set
up
god
kingdom
our
duti
to
the
state
render
therefor
unto
caesar
the
thing
which
be
caesar
and
unto
god
the
thing
which
be
god
luke
let
everi
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
power
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
power
that
be
are
ordain
of
god
whosoev
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordin
of
god
rom
submit
yourselv
to
everi
ordin
of
man
for
the
lord
sake
whether
it
be
to
king
a
suprem
for
so
is
the
will
of
god
that
with
well
do
ye
may
put
to
silenc
the
ignor
of
foolish
men
pet
these
scriptur
make
it
clear
that
submiss
to
the
power
that
be
is
a
divin
command
but
it
is
equal
clear
from
act
that
when
ani
ordin
of
man
run
counter
to
god
law
we
must
refus
submiss
to
it
the
reason
for
thi
is
that
we
are
god
bond
servant
and
hi
servic
is
our
life
task
an
exampl
of
the
type
of
thing
is
in
col
where
bondserv
were
to
work
heartili
a
unto
the
lord
so
also
we
should
work
a
if
our
bos
wa
god
ie
press
down
shaken
togeth
and
run
over
oop
a
bit
of
a
side
track
there
in
the
contest
between
the
nation
we
are
on
god
side
a
side
that
is
not
fight
in
the
battl
but
is
testifi
to
the
truth
when
we
believ
in
god
and
embrac
hi
promis
we
becom
fellow
citizen
with
the
saint
and
of
the
household
of
god
and
are
no
longer
interest
in
associ
of
the
world
think
of
thi
in
relat
to
union
etc
a
well
paul
tell
u
to
lay
asid
everi
weight
that
we
may
run
the
race
that
is
set
befor
u
and
if
we
are
wise
we
will
discard
ani
associ
which
would
retard
our
progress
thou
therefor
endur
hard
a
a
good
soldier
of
jesu
christ
no
man
that
warreth
entangleth
himself
with
the
affair
of
thi
life
that
he
may
plea
him
who
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
soldier
tim
one
of
these
entangl
he
warn
about
is
be
ye
not
unequ
yoke
togeth
with
unbeliev
one
of
the
obviou
applic
of
thi
is
marriag
with
unbeliev
but
it
also
cover
thing
like
busi
partnership
and
ani
other
posit
where
we
may
form
a
close
associ
with
ani
person
or
person
not
believ
the
truth
about
god
in
thi
case
the
armi
the
principl
come
from
deut
rememb
that
a
well
a
them
be
differ
anim
of
differ
strength
one
wa
clean
and
one
unclean
under
the
law
these
idea
are
strongli
stress
in
cor
i
suggest
you
read
thi
the
yoke
also
ha
anoth
aspect
that
of
servitud
and
jesu
say
take
my
yoke
upon
you
so
we
are
then
yoke
with
christ
and
can
not
be
yoke
with
unbeliev
we
have
alreadi
seen
that
we
are
bondserv
of
christ
and
paul
say
becom
not
ye
the
bondserv
of
men
cor
rv
an
exampl
from
the
old
testament
the
question
is
ask
in
chr
shouldest
thou
help
the
ungodli
the
situat
here
is
a
good
exampl
of
what
happen
when
you
are
yoke

with
unbeliev
jehoshaphat
wa
lucki

the
fact
he
had
made
an
affin
with
ahab
who
had
sold
himself
to
work
wicked
befor
the
lord
king
when
ask
by
ahab
to
form
a
militari
allianc
he
had
agre
and
said
i

he
sttod
firm
in
refus
the
advic
of
the
fals
prophet
and
insist
on
hear
the
prophet
of
the
lord
tri
to
do
the
right
thing
he
found
that

and
therefor
couldnt
break
away
from
the
evil
associ
he
had
made
god
say
to
u
come
out
from

them
and
be
ye
separ
and
touch
not

and
i
will
receiv
you
and
ye
shall
be
my
son
and
daughter
cor
thi
is
more
or
le
what
i
have
found
out
so
far
im
still
look
into
it
a
i
dont
think
ive
answer
all
the
question
rais
by
alastair
yet
here
a
summari
and
a
few
thing
to
think
about
the
christian
in
under
command
obedi
to
thi
command
is
an
essenti
factor
in
hi
relationship
with
christ
john
total
dedic
to
thi
cours
of
action
is
requir
roman
disobedi
compromis
the
close
relationship
between
christ
and
hi
follow
pet
we
are
to
be
separ
to
god
rom
thi
involv
a
masterserv
relationship
rom
no
man
can
serv
two
master
matt
all
that
is
in
the
kosmo
is
lust
and
pride
quit
oppos
to
go
john
christ
kingdom
is
not
of
thi
world
ie
not
worldli
in
natur
if
it
wa
hi
servant
would
fight
to
deliv
him
if
christ
is
our
master
and
he
wa
not
deliv
by
hi
servant
becaus
hi
kingdom
wa
not
of
thi
world
then
hi
servant
can
not
possibl
fight
for
anoth
master
stranger
and
pilgrim
have
no
right
and
we
can
not
swear
allegi
to
anyon
but
god
the
servant
of
the
lord
must
not
war
but
be
gentl
to
all
tim
thi
doe
not
just
appli
to
war
but
also
to
avoid
strife
throughout
our
live
there
is
a
war
to
be
wage
not
with
man
weapon
cor
but
with
god
armour
eph

some
more
when
ive
had
time
