let
talk
about
principl
if
we
accept
that
god
set
the
standard
for
what
ought
to
be
includ
in
scriptur
then
we
can
ask
is
it
authorit
authorit
is
not
a
qualiti
of
the
write
itself
it
is
a
statement
by
the
commun
of
faith
whether
it
will
accept
the
write
a
norm
arguabl
it
is
both
sinc
author
is
a
matter
of
both
commun
and
recepi
we
can
say
that
for
exampl
jesu
is
lord
whether
the
world
at
larg
accept
the
author
or
not
thu
the
bibl
can
be
consid
for
it
authorit
content
whether
or
not
it
is
accept
thi
issu
is
at
the
heart
of
pilat
pragmat
question
what
is
truth
to
jesu
when
our
lord
wa
brought
befor
him
jesu
repli
wa
to
appeal
to
the
author
of
hi
father
you
also
might
like
to
consid
the
claim
author
repres
by
the
statement
thu
say
the
lord
in
the
bibl
which
claim
to
put
across
the
exact
word
of
god
you
fall
into
the
danger
of
relativ
with
your
reject
of
inher
author
and
claim
that
it
lie
onli
in
the
commun
of
faith
doe
someth
becom
truth
becaus
it
is
accept
the
main
thrust
of
my
argument
is
that
there
is
a
godward
direct
a
well
a
a
manward
which
is
where
the
refer
to
rev
came
in
is
it
prophet
how
is
propheci
to
be
defin
if
it
is
speak
forth
of
god
messag
much
of
the
apocrypha
must
sure
qualifi
if
we
narrow
it
down
to
the
predict
element
which
will
cut
out
some
of
the
accept
ot
book
a
well
we
nonetheless
have
criterion
for
determin
the
valid
of
the
book
jesu
standard
were
that
scriptur
can
not
be
broken
can
you
name
a
singl
propheci
that
fit
the
bill
in
the
apocrapha
ie
definit
fulfil
after
it
ha
been
written
is
it

by

standard
is
authent
a
function
of
the

what
thi

the
