write
a
similar
analog
might
be
a
medic
doctor
who
belief
that
a
blood
transfus
is
necessari
to
save
the
life
of
a
child
whose
parent
are
jehovah
wit
and
so
have
conscienti
object
to
blood
transfus
the
doctor
effort
to
persuad
them
to
agre
to
a
blood
transfus
could
be
perceiv
to
be
arrog
in
precis
the
same
way
a
christian
could
be
perceiv
to
be
arrog
the
truth
or
otherwis
of
the
belief
that
a
blood
transfus
is
necessari
to
save
the
life
of
the
child
is
irrelev
here
what
matter
is
that
the
doctor
belief
it
to
be
true
and
could
be
seen
to
be
tri
to
foce
hi
belief
on
the
parent
and
thi
could
well
be
perceiv
a
arrog
let
me
carri
that
a
step
further
most
doctor
would
not
claim
to
be
infal
inde
they
would
gener
admit
that
they
could
conceiv
be
wrong
eg
that
in
thi
case
a
blood
tranfus
might
not
turn
out
to
be
necessari
after
all
howev
the
doctor
would
have
enough
confid
and
convict
to
claim
out
of
genuin
concern
that
is
is
necessari
a
fallibl
human
be
they
must
acknowledg
the
possibl
that
they
are
wrong
howev
they
would
also
say
that
such
doubt
are
not
reason
and
stand
by
their
