no

also
felt

said
chhurch

had
broken
on

the

indic
the

could
pursu

arent
these
the
same
behavior
we
condemn
in

hari
krishna
and
other

i
think
the
issu
are
more
complex
than
the
newspap
account
mention
first
im
not
entir
sure
that
parent
consent
is
absolut
requir
thi
would
be
extrem
difficult
becaus
of
the
clear
command
to
obey
parent
but
if
an
older
child
insist
on
be
baptiz
without
their
parent
consent
i
might
be
will
to
do
it
howev
thi
would
be
a
seriou
step
and
would
warrant
much
care
discus
the
problem
i
find
here
is
not
so
much
parent
consent
a
that
there
wa
nobodi
consent
whether
you
believ
in
infant
baptism
or
not
baptism
is
suppos
to
be
the
sign
of
entri
into
a
christian
commun
if
there
isnt
a
commit
from
somebodi
whether
parent
or
child
and
no
intent
to
becom
part
of

the
baptism
appear
to
be
a
lie
furthermor
it
is
like
to
rais
seriou
practic
problem
what
if
the
child
is
from

tradit
normal
when
he
reach

he
would
be
expect
to

but
he
alreadi
ha

doe
he
