what
in
a
name
the
sequel
ive
been
think
about
the
idea
that
wa
rais
by
michael
covington
i
think
that
word
mean
what
we
think
they
mean
regardless
of
etymolog
ive
been
reflect
on
what
certain
word
meant
in
my
childhood
and
trace
how
thi
shape
some
of
my
attitud
i
grew
up
in
a
home
where
christ
wa
a
bad
word
peopl
who
were
veri
angri
said
it
the
word
christian
meant
someon
who
wa
not
a
jew
it
carri
connot
of
other
of
threat
of
enemi
it
took
some
time
to
figur
out
that
there
wa
a
connect
between
christ
and
christian
when
i
accept
jesu
i
expect
to
be
disown
to
becom
a
christian
meant
to
join
the
enemi
i
knew
other
would
consid
me
a
traitor
at
some
level
i
agre
but
wa
still
prepar
to
pay
thi
price
like
esau
i
sold
my
birthright
howev
i
made
a
better
bargain
he
onli
got
some
stew
but
i
got
the
incompar
rich
of
know
christ
a
it
turn
out
my
parent
did
not
disown
me
i
found
out
later
that
they
were
hope
it
wa
a
phase
that
i
would
grow
out
of
by
the
time
they
had
decid
it
wasnt
a
phase
they
were
sort
of
use
to
it
they
didnt
disown
me
but
they
didnt
complet
accept
the
situat
either
for
exampl
they
didnt
come
to
my
wed
becaus
it
wa
in
a
church
when
i
visit
my
grandmoth
in
the
hospit
a
few
day
befor
her
death
she
said
to
me
a
far
a
im
concern
you
still
are
a
jew
what
she
meant
wa
that
she
love
me
and
forgav
me
but
i
am
not
a
jew
i
am
a
christian
ill
conced
one
that
like
chicken
soup
with
matzoh
ball
i
do
not
keep
kosher
i
do
not
celebr
the
sabbath
on
saturday
my
son
are
not
circumcis
but
these
thing
are
true
of
some
peopl
who
do
consid
themselv
jew
it
is
not
these
rule
that
make
peopl
jew
it
is
the
heritag
from
the
past
i
gave
up
the
past
thi
is
whi
i
find
it
hard
to
relat
to
messian
jew
their
experi
is
unlik
mine
they
still
consid
themselv
jew
while
follow
jesu
some
would
even
say
that
i
must
do
so
too
i
am
at
a
stage
of
my
life
now
where
i
would
like
to
have
a
heritag
it
wa
not
someth
i
valu
veri
much
when
i
gave
it
but
i
did
have
a
sens
that
i
wa
give
it
for
god
it
may
have
been
a
small
sacrific
it
may
have
been
an
unnecessari
sacrific
but
i
gave
it
and
do
not
want
to
ask
for
it
back
and
while
i
dont
have
the
heritag
i
wa
born
with
i
do
have
anoth
i
am
an
outcast
from
the
hous
of
israel
but
i
am
a
member
of
the
church
one
of
the
thing
i
like
about
be
a
cathol
christian
is
that
it
is
rich
in
tradit
it
give
me
a
feel
of
onc
again
be
root
in
the
past
thi
is
probabl
one
of
the
reason
whi
i
dont
like
it
when
peopl
mess
around
with
christian
tradit
for
exampl
chang
the
name
of
easter
these
tradit
fill
an
import
emot
need
of
mine
i
suppos
the
point
of
all
thi
is
that
peopl
shouldnt
assum
that
all
believ
of
jewish
background
are
the
same
for
some
jewish
christian
is
a
good
name
for
other
it
is
an
oxymoron
