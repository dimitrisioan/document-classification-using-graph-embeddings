re
do
the
work
of
god
desire
bradley
ask
u
whether
we
should
think
of
the
serb
a
do
god
work
in
bosnia
ive
refrain
from
post
in
hope
that
someon
who
is
more
familiar
with
the
ot
than
i
would
answer
but
at
thi
point
i
feel
i
have
to
say
someth
mani
thing
about
thi
post
bother
me
i
know
of
not
the
slightest
suggest
in
the
nt
that
christian
should
use
forc
to
propag
the
gospel
and
the
idea
that
we
should
not
be
concern
about
the
death
of
moslem
violat
the
heart
of
the
gospel
christ
die
to
break
down
these
distinct
in
him
there
is
neither
jew
nor
greek
there
is
neither
slave
nor
free
there
is
neither
male
nor
femal
if
moslem
do
not
know
him
we
may
preach
to
them
but
we
dont
kill
them
furthermor
the
attack
is
between
state
not
religion
there
are
christian
be
attack
a
well
one
of
the
town
under
attack
is
one
of
the
few
place
where
christian
and
moslem
are
live
togeth
peac
the
preced
be
suggest
are
from
the
ot
there
are
in
fact
two
differ
thing
be
allud
to
the
first
is
from
the
entri
into
canaan
for
that
to
be
a
parallel
we
would
need
for
god
to
have
promis
thi
land
through
a
prophet
and
we
would
need
the
war
to
be
a
holi
war
there
were
tight
constraint
on
behavior
in
those
attack
ani
violat
were
like
to
caus
the
israelit
to
be
defeat
rape
would
not
have
been
toler
while
the
account
in
joshua
emphas
town
that
were
total
destroy
note
that
it
wa
possibl
for
a
town
to
make
peac
with
the
israelit
and
that
onc
that
wa
done
even
when
decept
wa
involv
they
were
expect
to
honor
it
in
contrast
there
have
been
mani
violat
of
agreement
in
thi
incid
i
see
no
evid
that
god
ha
grant
bosnia
to
the
serb
a
a
promis
land
and
if
he
had
their
behavior
would
have
disqualifi
thi
from
be
a
holi
war
the
other
ot
parallel
is
from
later
when
israel
wa
defeat
by
assyria
and
babylonia
the
prophet
saw
thi
a
a
judgement
on
israel
for
her
sin
someon
ask
whether
we
shouldnt
see
thi
a
a
judgement
on
the
bosnian
for
their
sin
thi
sound
like
a
replay
of
the
old
claim
that
we
shouldnt
have
doctor
or
hospit
becaus
ill
is
god
judgement
ye
even
bad
thing
may
be
use
by
god
for
good
that
includ
action
of
bad
peopl
but
that
doesnt
justifi
them
if
you
read
the
prophet
you
find
them
veri
clear
that
in
attack
israel
the
assyrian
and
babylonian
were
act
a
unintent
agent
of
god
their
intent
wa
to
attack
god
peopl
and
they
would
be
judg
for
it
the
fact
that
they
were
actual
carri
out
god
plan
didnt
excus
their
action
furthermor
we
shouldnt
conclud
from
thi
that
all
attack
are
judgement
from
god
god
explicitli
interpret
that
case
through
hi
prophet
a
far
a
i
know
he
did
not
send
ani
prophet
to
bosnia
while
i
find
it
hard
to
see
ani
good
in
the
current
fight
i
am
sure
god
will
eventu
make
good
come
out
of
bad
but
that
doesnt
justifi
it
and
it
wont
save
the
peopl
who
are
do
it
from
judgement
i
am
particularli
concern
about
the
implic
of
thi
issu
becaus
of
current
tension
between
the
west
and
moslemori
nation
what
we
do
not
need
is
for
moslem
to
conclud
that
christian
think
it
ok
to
kill
moslem
the
implic
for
the
mideast
and
even
relat
with
american
moslem
could
be
quit
seriou
