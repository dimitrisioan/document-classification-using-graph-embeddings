subject
ten
command
or
ten
discours
in
the
cours
of
discuss
the
sabbath
with
some
folk
i
came
across
someth
that
wa
complet
new
to
me
and
i
thought
id
offer
it
for
comment
to
keep
thi
a
brief
a
possibl
let
me
state
my
observ
a
a
declar
statement
and
then
whoever
want
to
can
comment
on
it
basic
what
i
think
ive
observ
is
that
the
phrase
the
ten
command
a
use
by
mose
is
not
a
refer
to
ex
but
rather
a
refer
to
ten
distinct
discours
from
ex
through
ex
that
is
the
phrase
the
ten
command
should
more
accur
be
translat
the
ten
discours
of
which
the
passag
we
call
the
ten
command
is
realli
onli
the
first
im
not
complet
convinc
that
the
abov
is
true
but
for
purpos
of
discuss
let
me
argu
it
a
though
i
wa
sure
argument
support
the
abov
idea
there
arent
realli
ten
command
in
ex
in
order
to
get
command
you
have
to
get
two
of
them
out
of
vers
and
the
vers
themselv
do
not
support
such
a
divis
becaus
they
are
all
about
not
worship
other
god
that
is
vers
command
to
have
no
other
god
and
vers
command
to
not
worship
the
idol
mention
in
vers
you
cant
violat
vers
without
violat
vers
indic
that
the
whole
passag
is
one
command
and
leav
u
with
onli
nine
command
i
could
go
on
at
length
about
thi
but
for
now
ill
just
stop
with
thi
summari
there
are
ten
speech
between
ex
the
begin
of
the
tradit
ten
command
and
ex
where
god
actual
give
mose
the
two
tablet
with
the
ten
commandmentsdiscours
written
on
them
i
break
these
ten
down
a
follow
and
in
most
case
each
of
these
passag
begin
with
some
variat
of
the
phrase
and
the
lord
spoke
to
mose
say
the
except
is
ex
which
begin
now
these
are
the
ordin
which
you
are
to
set
befor
them
the
word
translat
command
in
the
phrase
the
ten
command
isnt
realli
the
word
for
command
it
the
word
for
a
speech
or
an
utter
it
a
word
often
use
for
longer
discours
rather
than
individu
statement
for
instanc
when
combin
with
the
word
yom
day
thi
word
is
translat
chronicl
in
such
phrase
a
now
the
rest
of
the
act
of
soandso
are
they
not
written
in
the
chronicl
of
x
the
word
for
command
is
freeli
use
throughout
the
book
of
mose
and
perhap
it
is
signific
that
when
mose
spoke
of
the
ten
x
he
appear
to
have
avoid
the
word
for
command
and
chosen
instead
a
word
associ
with
discours
longer
than
just
a
singl
command
god
tell
mose
that
he
is
go
to
give
him
the
stone
tablet
with
the
law
and
the
command
ex
yet
he
doe
not
give
mose
the
tablet
until
he
ha
finish
all
ten
discours
on
mount
sinai
if
the
ten
command
were
onli
ex
it
is
not
immedi
clear
whi
god
would
wait
sever
day
and
nine
more
discours
befor
give
these
tablet
to
mose
on
the
other
hand
if
we
have
the
ten
discours
written
on
the
tablet
then
it
make
perfect
sens
that
god
would
not
give
mose
the
tablet
until
he
had
finish
deliv
all
ten
discours
when
mose
did
get
the
tablet
he
found
that
both
tablet
were
written
on
both
side
ex
if
these
ten
command
were
onli
the
first
vers
of
ex
god
would
have
had
to
have
written
in
larg
letter
not
that
he
couldnt
have
of
cours
but
it
doe
seem
more
like
to
me
that
thi
is
a
refer
to
two
tablet
contain
ten
discours
written
in
normal
size
letter
in
ii
cor
paul
seem
to
specif
singl
out
the
command
written
on
stone
a
be
the
ministri
of
death
that
which
is
fade
away
and
the
ministri
of
condemn
with
the
possibl
except
of
the
command
about
the
sabbath
it
is
difficult
to
see
whi
paul
would
refer
to
the
command
in
ex
a
be
temporari
fade
awaytyp
command
thi
is
le
of
a
problem
if
the
stone
tablet
should
happen
to
have
includ
all
of
the
command
from
ex
through
ex
argument
against
thi
idea
the
main
argument
against
thi
idea
asid
from
the
fact
that
it
contradict
a
longstand
tradit
is
that
in
dt
mose
say
after
quot
the
command
in
ex
these
word
the
lord
spokeand
he
ad
no
more
and
he
wrote
them
on
two
tablet
of
stone
and
gave
them
to
me
thi
appear
to
identifi
the
word
just
quot
a
be
the
onli
content
of
the
two
stone
tablet
that
wa
my
first
impress
anyway
howev
after
some
thought
i
note
that
a
great
deal
hing
on
how
you
understand
the
phrase
these
word
if
mose
meant
these
word
which
i
have
just
relat
to
you
were
spoken
by
god
etc
then
that
would
mean
that
onli
the
tradit
ten
command
were
on
the
stone
tablet
if
howev
mose
wa
make
a
parenthet
commentthes
word
which
i
am
now
tell
you
were
spoken
by
god
etcthen
that
quit
differ
i
did
note
that
in
the
dt
account
mose
tell
of
be
given
the
stone
tablet
befor
tell
of
the
peopl
ask
mose
to
repres
them
befor
god
wherea
in
the
exodu
account
the
peopl
ask
thi
of
mose
between
the
first
and
second
discours
sever
day
befor
god
gave
mose
the
stone
tablet
thi
reinforc
the
idea
that
mose
remark
in
dt
ff
were
intend
a
a
parenthet
remark
rather
than
a
strictli
chronolog
account
of
when
god
wrote
what
and
at
what
point
he
stop
ad
to
what
wa
on
the
tablet
summari
all
thing
consid
i
find
it
somewhat
more
like
that
the
nine
command
in
ex
are
realli
onli
the
first
of
what
mose
regard
a
the
ten
discours
of
god
i
dont
know
if
anybodi
ha
ever
espous
thi
idea
befor
it
brandnew
to
me
so
while
i
lean
toward
accept
it
i
would
be
veri
interest
in
hear
ani
comment
and
critic
anyon
may
care
to
offer
mark
