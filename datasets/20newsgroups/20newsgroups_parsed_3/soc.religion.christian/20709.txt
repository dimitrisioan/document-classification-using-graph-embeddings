languag
a
unbibl
i
wa
speak

thing
like

the
threefold

formula
is
biblic
a
you
point
out
i
normal
use
the
term
threefold
in
refer
to
mat
while
it
is
certainli
consist
with
belief
in
the
triniti
the
triniti
is
a
doctrin
whose
full
formul
occur
in
the
th
and
th
cent
it
unlik
that
mat
had
in
mind
the
fullydevelop
trinitarian
doctrin
inde
the
threefold
baptism
formula
is
use
by
some
group
that
do
not
believ
in
the
triniti
the
disagr
over
baptism
formula
occur
becaus
of
passag
such
a
act
which
command
baptism
in
the
name
of
jesu
there
are
a
coupl
of
other
passag
in
act
a
well
thi
leav
u
with
sort
of
a
problem
were
command
in
mat
to
baptiz
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holi
spirit
and
in
act
to
baptiz
in
the
name
of
jesu
jesu
onli
group
baptiz
in
the
name
of
jesu
they
consid
thi
consist
with
mat
becaus
they
say
that
jesu
is
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holi
spirit
im
not
the
right
one
to
ask
to
explain
what
thi
mean
i
will
simpli
say
that
it
doe
not
appear
to
be
normal
trinitarian
theolog
it
is
also
an
odd
way
of
deal
with
the
idiomat
phrase
in
the
name
of
those
who
use
the
threefold
formula
dont
seem
to
have
a
standard
answer
to
the
passag
talk
about
baptiz
in
the
name
of
jesu
i
suspect
that
the
most
common
explan
is
to
say
that
in
the
name
of
need
not
be
a
verbal
formula
to
say
that
you
baptiz
in
the
name
of
jesu
may
simpli
mean
that
you
are
do
baptism
under
jesu
author
in
the
st
cent
context
it
contrast
christian
baptism
with
the
baptism
of
john
or
other
jewish
baptism
of
cours
there
a
certain
parallel
between
these
passag
that
suggest
that
we
could
just
a
well
say
that
mat
doesnt
requir
the
specif
threefold
formula
to
be
use
in
baptism
but
simpli
character
baptism
done
by
those
who
follow
the
father
son
and
holi
spirit
one
might
well
suspect
that
in
the
earli
church
more
than
one
baptism
formula
wa
use
so
long
a
we
consid
follow
jesu
to
be
the
same
a
follow
the
father
son
and
holi
spirit
no
great
damag
would
be
done
by
such
a
differ
thi
doe
not
mean
that
i
think
we
should
go
back
to
use
both
formula
baptism
is
one
of
the
few
thing
that
almost
all
christian
group
now
recogn
mutual
so
i
do
not
think
do
someth
to
upset
that
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
gospel
thi
is
reinforc
by
the
fact
that
those
group
that
actual
use
in
the
name
of
jesu
now
do
seem
to
have
in
mind
a
differ
in
doctrin
but
a
ive
said
befor
im
not
the
one
to
explain
what
their
doctrin
is
clh
