subject
whi
religion
and
which
religion
my
famili
ha
never
been
particularli
religi
sing
christma
carol
is
about
the
limit
for
them
thu
ive
never
realli
believ
in
god
and
heaven
although
i
dont
actual
believ
that
they
dont
exist
either
im
sort
of
undecid
probabl
like
a
lot
of
peopl
i
guess
late
ive
been
think
about
it
all
a
lot
more
and
i
wonder
how
religi
peopl
can
be
so
convinc
that
there
is
a
god
i
feel
a
though
i
want
to
believ
but
im
not
use
to
believ
thing
without
proof
just
a
i
cant
believ
that
there
definit
isnt
a
god
so
i
cant
definit
believ
that
there
is
i
wonder
if
most
of
you
were
brought
up
by
religi
famili
and
never
believ
ani
differ
can
anyon
help
me
to
understand
how
your
belief
and
faith
in
god
can
be
so
strong
anoth
question
that
frequent
cross
my
mind
is
which
religion
is
correct
how
do
you
choos
a
religion
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
christian
god
exist
and
the
god
of
other
religion
dont
how
do
you
feel
about
peopl
who
follow
other
religion
how
about
atheist
and
peopl
like
me
agnost
i
suppos
do
you
respect
their
religion
and
accept
their
belief
a
just
a
valid
a
your
own
isnt
there
contradict
between
the
religion
how
can
your
religion
be
more
valid
than
ani
other
do
you
have
le
respect
for
someon
if
theyr
not
religi
or
if
they
follow
a
differ
religion
than
you
would
if
they
were
christian
also
how
much
of
the
scriptur
are
correct
are
all
event
in
the
bibl
realli
suppos
to
have
happen
or
are
they
just
suppos
to
be
stori
with
moral
show
a
true
christian
how
to
behav
i
gener
follow
most
of
the
christian
idea
which
i
suppos
are
fairli
univers
throughout
all
religion
not
kill
steal
etc
and
love
my
neighbour
for
want
of
a
better
express
the
onli
part
i
find
hard
is
the
actual
belief
in
god
final
what
is
god
attitud
to
peopl
like
me
who
dont
quit
believ
in
him
but
are
gener
fairli
good
peopl
sure
not
believ
doesnt
make
me
a
wors
person
if
not
i
find
myself
wonder
whi
i
so
strongli
want
to
realli
believ
and
to
find
a
religion
sorri
if
i
waffl
on
a
bit
i
wa
just
write
idea
a
they
came
into
my
head
im
sure
i
probabl
repeat
myself
a
bit
too

help
