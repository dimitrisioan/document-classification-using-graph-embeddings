write
i
am
ask
you
to
believ
in
thing
not
visibl
i
dont
know
if
thi
is
believ
blindli
or
not
im
not
sure
how
blind
come
into
it
i
do
not
deni
reason
inde
i
insist
upon
it
but
reason
onli
draw
conclus
from
evid
if
you
decid
in
advanc
that
your
reason
will
act
onli
on
the
evid
of
the
five
physic
sen
then
you
cut
reason
off
from
ani
possibl
of
reach
a
conclus
outsid
the
physic
sphere
beyond
the
rather
provoc
if
inconclus
conclus
that
the
physic
sphere
is
not
self
explanatori
so
your
are
say
to
reli
on
our
feel
and
experi
sinc
thi
is
the
onli
other
sourc
of
inform
left
to
u
how
can
you
then
convinc
somebodi
that
your
feel
and
experi
are
the
correct
one
then
if
you
cant
show
somebodi
visibl
and
measur
effect
if
my
experi
say
that
there
exist
no
god
and
your
say
there
doe
where
doe
that
leav
u
sinc
we
are
onli
go
on
experi
then
both
of
u
are
correct
within
our
own
person
realiti
furthermor
the
troubl
with
feel
and
experi
is
that
they
can
lead
you
astray
a
the
tragic
outcom
of
waco
illustr
i
am
sure
that
mani
of
koresh
follow
realli
believ
in
him
but
i
think
that
you
and
i
will
agre
that
they
were
be
misl
final
how
on
earth
do
you
come
to
the
conclus
that
the
physic
sphere
is
not
selfexplanatori
when
you
onli
reli
on
the
five
sen
christian
claim
that
they
have
receiv
a
differ
kind
of
evid
which
they
call
faith
and
which
is
a
gift
of
god
that
is
thi
evid
is
the
evid
of
a
thing
which
choos
to
reveal
or
hide
itself
the
evid
of
the
sen
can
not
tell
you
is
such
a
ting
exist
reason
on
the
evid
of
the
sen
wont
help
either
but
christian
do
reason
of
the
evid
of
faith
and
do
claim
that
thi
evid
is
wholli
consist
with
the
evid
of
the
other
sen
and
inde
that
the
evid
of
these
other
sen
is
part
of
god
revel
of
himself
to
u
you
must
be
use
a
definit
of
evid
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
to
me
evid
is
someth
you
can
show
other
unambigu
that
what
you
are
say
is
true
howev
i
agre
with
you
that
belief
in
a
dieti
is
a
matter
of
faith
it
is
not
someth
you
can
share
around
other
must
experi
it
independantli
unfortun
a
i
have
explain
abov
thi
put
belief
down
to
a
matter
of
experi
my
impress
is
that
christian
do
not
have
the
monopoli
on
reason
evid
and
faith
a
far
a
ani
of
these
thing
can
go
in
a
previou
articl
say
you
are
right
that
scienc
and
reason
can
not
prove
anyth
howev
if
we
do
not
use
them
we
can
onli
then
believ
on
faith
alon
and
sinc
we
can
onli
use
faith
whi
is
one
pictur
of
god
eg
hinduism
ani
le
valid
than
anoth
eg
christian
faith
a
i
have
said
is
not
oppos
to
reason
it
is
simpli
a
new
sourc
of
evid
on
which
reason
may
oper
it
is
clear
that
human
be
have
mani
system
for
explain
the
evid
of
the
physic
sen
and
similarli
there
are
mani
system
for
explain
the
evid
provid
by
faith
religi
believ
in
gener
and
christian
in
particular
use
reason
to
help
sift
through
the
evid
to
come
to
a
clearer
understand
of
the
evid
provid
by
faith
scienc
claim
with
good
reason
to
be
the
most
valid
system
for
explain
the
physic
univers
and
christian
claim
also
with
good
reason
to
be
the
most
valid
system
possess
of
the
best
evid
for
explain
god
revel
of
himself
to
man
at
the
risk
of
repeat
my
argument
a
i
have
explain
previous
the
troubl
is
that
moslem
buddhist
jew
etc
will
all
say
that
they
claim
with
good
reason
to
be
a
valid
system
possess
of
the
best
evid
for
explain
god
revel
to
man
for
buddhist
it
should
read
for
explain
the
nonexist
of
god
so
not
onli
must
you
prove
your
own
case
you
have
to
disprov
their
altmessian
is
a
good
place
to
see
peopl
strong
in
the
belief
of
their
own
faith
and
with
their
own
good
reason
if
you
doubt
that
christian
use
reason
read
thi
newsgroup
for
a
while
and
you
will
see
ration
debat
aplenti
i
know
that
all
peopl
can
use
reason
i
never
claim
that
they
dont
i
just
wish
to
make
sure
that
their
argument
are
wellfound
it
go
without
say
that
if
i
make
a
blunder
that
i
expect
peopl
to
correct
me
onc
we
have
all
gone
through
thi
process
of
remov
the
nonessenti
and
contradictori
bit
we
should
hope
have
made
some
progress
toward
the
