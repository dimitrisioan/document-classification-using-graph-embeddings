male
infant
wa
made
a
part
of
god
coven
with
israel
it
wa
command
to
be
perform
on
the
eighth

the
earli
church
understood
thi
and
even
debat
whether
baptism
had
to
be
perform
on
the
eighth
day
or
if
it
could
in
fact
be
done
earlier
aaron
roman
but
not
all
the
israelit
accept
the
good
aaron
news
for
isaiah
say
lord
who
ha
believ
our
messag
aaron
consequ
faith
come
from
hear
the
messag
and
the
aaron
messag
is
heard
through
the
word
of
christ
aaron
so
then
we
receiv
god
gift
of
faith
to
u
a
we
hear
the
aaron
messag
of
the
gospel
and
the
gospel

do
you

also
describ
a
a

from

ephesian
he
give
faith
to
infant
just
a
he
give
it
to
adult
through
the
power
of
the
gospel
roman
aaron
if
you
read
all
of
ezekiel
you
will
see
that
god
doesnt
aaron
hold
u
guilti
for
anyon
el
sin
so
we
can
have
no
aaron
origin
guilt
from
adam
here
you
show
that
you
just
dont
understand
origin
sin
you
are
argu
against
a
straw
man
mayb
youv
been
talk
to
cathol
too
much
i
dont
know
but
origin
sin
doe
not
consist
of
god
imput
of
adam
guilt
to
u
it
consist
of
our
inherit
of
adam
sin
natur
it
is
actual
sin
see
for
exampl
the
augsburg
confess
articl
ii
and
the
apolog
of
the
augsburg
confess
articl
ii
and
for
extra
credit
john

the
scot

articl
iii
aaron
now
then
that
we
have
a
littl
more
background
a
to
whi
aaron
origin
sin
is
not
biblic
let
look
at
some
of
the
aaron
scriptur
use
to
support
it
aaron
roman
therefor
just
a
sin
enter
the
world
through
aaron
one
man
and
death
through
sin
and
in
thi
way
death
came
to
aaron
all
men
becaus
all
sin
ask
yourself
thi
question
do
infant
ever
die
then
ask
yourself
if
infant
baptism
is
not
valid
then
where
wa
the
christian
church
dure
all
the
centuri
when
almost
all
of
the
baptism
were
perform
on
infant
were
luther
melancthon
calvin
zwingli
hu
knox
andra
and
chemnitz
christian
aaron
psalm
sure
i
wa
sin
at
birth
sin
from
the
time
aaron
my
mother
conceiv
me
aaron
thi
whole
psalm
is
a
wonder
exampl
of
how
we
should
humbl
aaron
ourselv
befor
god
in
repent
for
sin
david
himself
aaron
wa
a
man
after
god
own
heart
and
wrote
the
psalm
after
aaron
commit
adultri
with
bathsheba
and
murder
her
husband
aaron
all
that
david
is
say
here
is
that
he
cant
rememb
a
time
aaron
when
he
wasnt
sin
he
is
humbl
himself
befor
god
by
aaron
confess
hi
sin
hi
say
that
he
wa
sin
at
aaron
birth
is
a
hyperbol
the
bibl
be
inspir
by
god
isnt
aaron
limit
to
a
liter
interpet
but
also
use
figur
of
aaron
speech
a
did
jesu
john
for
anoth
exampl
of
aaron
hyperbol
see
luke
who
are
you
to
say
what
is
liter
and
what
is
not
is
a
liter
interpret
manifestli
absurd
in
psalm
by
reason
of
direct
contradict
with
a
clear
passag
from
the
word
of
god
you
might
also
compar
genesi
the
lord
smell
the
plea
aroma
and
said
in
hi
heart
never
again
will
i
cur
the
ground
becaus
of
man
even
though
everi
inclin
of
hi
heart
is
evil
from
childhood
aaron
we
see
aaron
that
he
did
grow
and
becom
wiser
in
luke
and
the
aaron
implic
is
that
jesu
did
wrong
thing
a
a
child
befor
he
aaron
knew
to
choos
right
over
wrong
you
are
a
long
way
from
prove
thi
rather
monstrou
assert
all
you
can
say
is
that
jesu
grew
in
wisdom
and
in
statur
a
conclus
that
he
did
wrong
a
a
child
is
base
on
an
extrapol
of
reason
not
on
a
direct
revel
in
scriptur
david
h
wagner
but
mad
reason
rush
forth
and
a
confession
lutheran
becaus
baptism
is
not
dazzl

which
we
do
regard
it
