to

all
those
who
were
tri
to
assimil
the
bibl
messag
in
the
midst
of
their
daili
life
becaus
of
work
or
studi
it
is
often
imposs
to
spend
long
hour
in
silenc
and
reflect
but
everyon
can
take
an
hour
from
time
to
time
to
enter
a
church
sit
quietli
at
home
or
go
out
for
a
walk
in
the
wood
there
in
silenc
we
can
medit
on
a
passag
of
scriptur
to
listen
to
the
voic
of
christ
dure
the
time
of
silenc
it
is
import
to
concentr
on
what
we
understand
and
not
wast
time
worri
if
in
some
biblic
express
we
find
it
difficult
to
hear
the
voic
of
christ
the
idea
is
to
commun
to
other
what
we
have
understood
of
christ
not
burden
them
with
our
own
hesit
but
rather
tell
them
what
ha
brought
u

what
ha
led
