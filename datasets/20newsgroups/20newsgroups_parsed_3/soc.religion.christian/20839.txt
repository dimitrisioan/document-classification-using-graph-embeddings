larri
l
overack
write
respond
to
simon
i
may
be
interest
to
see
some
brief
select
post
to
the
net
my
understand
is
that
sspx
doe
not
consid
itself
in
schism
or
legitim
excommun
but
that
realli
besid
the
point
what
doe
the
roman
cathol
church
say
excommun
can
be
real
apart
from
formal
excommun
a
provid
for
in
canon
law
here
some
of
the
theolog
involv
for
the
interest
there
is
confus
over
thi
issu
of
the
sspx
schism
often
the
basic
problem
is
lack
of
an
abil
to
distinguish
between
true
obedi
fals
obedi
disobedi
schism
take
the
variou
classif
of
obedi
first
there
are
import
element
involv
here
for
my
purpos
a
command
the
respons
made
to
the
command
a
far
a
the
command
goe
command
can
be
legitim
such
a
the
pope
order
cathol
to
not
eat
meat
on
friday
or
they
can
be
illegitim
such
a
the
pope
order
cathol
to
worship
the
god
dagon
when
everi
other
full
moon
come
around
a
far
a
the
respons
to
a
command
goe
it
can
be
to
refus
to
do
what
is
command
or
to
compli
make
a
tabl
there
are
thu
possibilit
command
respons
name
legitim
compli
true
obedi
illegitim
refus
true
obedi
legitim
refus
disobedi
illegitim
compli
fals
obedi
so
now
you
see
where
my
classif
of
obedi
come
from
obedi
is
not
sole
a
matter
of
compliancerefus
the
natur
of
the
command
must
also
be
taken
into
account
it
is
not
enough
to
consid
someon
complianc
or
refus
and
then
say
whether
they
are
obedi
or
disobedi
you
also
have
to
take
into
consider
whether
the
command
are
good
or
bad
in
my
exampl
if
the
pope
command
all
cathol
to
worship
the
god
dagon
and
they
all
refus
they
arent
be
disobedi
at
all
a
far
a
the
societi
of
saint
piu
x
goe
they
are
certainli
refus
to
compli
with
certain
thing
the
pope
desir
but
that
alon
is
insuffici
to
allow
one
to
label
them
disobedi
you
also
have
to
consid
the
natur
of
the
papal
desir
and
there
the
rub
sspx
say
the
pope
sinc
vatican
ii
have
been
command
certain
veri
bad
thing
for
the
church
the
pope
have
of
cours
disagre
so
where
are
we
are
we
in
anoth
arian
heresi
complet
with
weak
pope
or
are
the
sspx
priest
modern
martin
luther
well
the
onli
way
to
answer
that
is
to
examin
who
is
say
what
and
what
the
tradit
teach
of
the
church
is
the
problem
here
is
that
veri
few
cathol
have
much
of
an
idea
of
what
is
realli
go
on
and
what
the
issu
are
the
religion
of
american
cathol
is
especi
defect
in
intellectu
depth
you
will
never
read
about
the
issu
be
discus
in
the
cathol
press
in
thi
countri
on
the
other
hand
one
italian
cathol
magazin
i
get
day
ha
had
interview
with
the
superior
gener
of
the
societi
of
saint
piu
x
mani
cathol
will
decid
to
side
with
the
pope
there
is
some
sound
in
thi
becaus
the
papaci
is
infal
so
eventu
some
pope
will
straighten
all
thi
out
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
also
unsound
in
thi
in
that
in
the
short
term
the
pope
may
inde
be
wrong
and
such
cathol
are
do
noth
to
help
the
situat
by
obey
them
where
theyr
wrong
in
fact
if
the
situat
is
grave
enough
they
sin
in
obey
him
at
the
veri
least
theyr
wast
a
great
opportun
becaus
they
are
fail
to
love
christ
in
a
heroic
way
at
the
veri
time
that
he
need
thi
badli
schism
let
move
on
to
schism
what
is
it
schism
is
a
superset
of
disobedi
refus
to
obey
a
legitim
command
all
schismat
are
disobedi
but
it
a
superset
so
it
doesnt
work
the
other
way
around
not
all
disobey
are
schismat
the
mere
fact
that
the
sspx
priest
dont
compli
with
the
holi
father
desir
doesnt
make
them
schismat
so
what
is
it
that
must
be
ad
to
disobedi
to
constitut
a
schism
mayb
thi
someth
el
make
the
sspx
priest
schismat
you
must
add
thi
the
reject
of
the
right
to
command
look
in
ani
decent
refer
on
cathol
theolog
and
that
what
youll
find
the
distinguish
criterion
of
schism
is
reject
of
the
right
to
command
here
what
the
cathol
encyclopedia
say
for
exampl
not
everi
disobedi
is
a
schism
in
order
to
posse
thi
charact
it
must
includ
besid
the
trangress
of
the
command
of
superior
denial
of
their
divin
right
to
command
from
the
ce
articl
schism
is
the
societi
of
saint
piu
x
then
schismat
the
answer
is
a
clear
no
they
say
that
the
pope
is
their
bos
they
pray
for
him
everi
day
and
that
all
that
matter
a
far
a
schism
goe
what
all
thi
boil
down
to
is
thi
if
we
leav
asid
the
consider
of
the
exact
natur
of
their
object
their
posit
is
a
legitim
one
a
far
a
the
cathol
theolog
of
obedi
and
schism
goe
they
are
resist
certain
papal
polici
becaus
they
think
that
they
are
clearli
contrari
to
the
tradit
teach
of
the
papaci
and
the
best
interest
of
the
church
in
fact
someon
who
find
himself
in
thi
situat
ha
a
duti
to
resist
now
what
is
the
stanc
of
rome
on
all
thi
well
if
you
read
the
holi
father
motu
proprio
ecclesia
dei
you
can
find
out
it
the
definit
document
on
the
subject
a
motu
proprio
is
a
specif
papal
act
it
not
the
product
of
a
roman
congreg
a
letter
that
the
pope
ha
possibl
never
even
read
it
from
the
pope
himself
hi
bos
is
god
there
no
one
el
to
complain
to
in
thi
document
the
holi
father
say
among
other
thing
the
episcop
consecr
perform
by
archbishop
lefebvr
constitut
a
schismat
act
archbishop
lefebvr
problem
wa
a
misunderstand
of
the
natur
of
tradtion
both
are
confus
i
fail
to
see
the
logic
of
the
pope
point
a
far
a
the
episcop
consecr
go
i
read
an
interest
articl
in
a
translat
of
the
italian
magazin
si
si
no
no
it
all
get
back
to
the
question
of
jurisdict
if
episcop
consecr
impli
reject
of
the
pope
jurisdict
then
they
would
truli
constitut
a
schismat
act
justifi
excommun
under
the
current
code
of
canon
law
but
my
problem
with
thi
is
thi
accord
to
the
tradit
theolog
of
holi
order
episcop
consecr
doe
not
confer
jurisdict
it
onli
confer
the
power
of
order
the
abil
to
confect
the
sacrament
jurisdict
must
be
confer
by
someon
el
with
the
power
to
confer
it
such
a
the
pope
the
societi
bishop
know
the
tradit
theolog
quit
well
take
great
pain
to
avoid
ani
pretenc
of
jurisdict
over
anyon
they
simpli
confer
those
sacrament
that
requir
a
bishop
the
si
si
no
no
articl
wa
interest
in
that
it
posit
that
the
reason
that
the
pope
said
what
he
did
is
that
he
ha
a
novel
postvatican
ii
idea
of
holi
order
accord
to
thi
idea
episcop
consecr
doe
confer
jurisdict
i
lent
the
articl
to
a
friend
unfortun
so
cant
tell
you
more
i
believ
they
quot
the
new
code
of
canon
law
in
support
of
thi
idea
the
pope
think
on
thi
point
remain
a
great
puzzl
to
me
there
no
way
there
is
a
schism
accord
to
tradit
cathol
theolog
so
whi
doe
the
pope
think
thi
a
far
a
the
point
regard
the
natur
of
tradit
goe
here
the
passag
in
question
the
root
of
thi
schismat
act
can
be
discern
in
an
incomplet
and
contradictori
notion
of
tradtion
incomplet
becaus
it
doe
not
take
suffici
into
the
account
the
live
charact
of
tradit
which
a
the
second
vatican
council
clearli
taught
come
from
the
apostl
and
progress
in
the
church
with
the
help
of
the
holi
spirit
there
is
a
growth
in
insight
into
the
realiti
and
word
that
are
be
pas
on
thi
come
about
in
variou
way
it
come
through
the
contempl
and
studi
of
believ
who
ponder
these
thing
in
their
heart
it
come
from
the
intim
sen
of
spiritu
realiti
which
they
experi
and
it
come
from
the
preach
of
those
who
have
receiv
along
with
their
right
of
success
in
the
espiscop
the
sure
charism
of
truth
but
especi
contradictori
is
a
notion
of
tradit
which
oppos
the
univers
magisterium
of
the
church
posse
by
the
bishop
of
rome
and
the
bodi
of
bishop
it
is
imposs
to
remain
faith
to
the
tradit
while
break
the
ecclesi
bond
with
him
to
whom
in
the
person
of
the
apostl
peter
christ
himself
entrust
the
ministri
of
uniti
in
hi
church
papal
motu
proprio
ecclesia
dei
juli
it
seem
to
me
that
the
holi
father
is
make
two
point
here
that
can
be
simplifi
to
the
follow
vatican
council
ii
ha
happen
i
am
the
pope
the
argument
be
that
either
case
is
suffici
to
prove
that
archbishop
lefebvr
must
be
wrong
becaus
he
disagre
with
them
thi
is
weak
to
say
the
least
it
would
have
help
clarifi
thing
more
if
the
pope
had
address
archbishop
lefebvr
concern
in
detail
what
is
john
paul
ii
stand
on
the
social

a
taught

xiii
piu
xi
and
piu
xii
for
exampl
are
we
suppos
to
ignor
what
all
these
pope
said
on
the
subject
i
dont
know
what
the
futur
will
hold
but
the
power
that
be
in
the
sspx
are
still
talk
with
rome
and
tri
to
straighten
thing
out
mani
peopl
would
prefer
to
call
a
justifi
refus
to
obey
justifi
disobedi
or
even
obey

rather
than

call
a
refus

put
u
into
a
sort
of
alic
in
wonderland
world
where
word
mean
whatev
we
want
them
to
mean
similarli
schism
indic
a
formal
break
in
the
church
if
the
pope
say
that
a
schism
exist
it
seem
to
me
that
by
definit
it
exist
it
may
be
that
the
pope
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
break
that
there
is
no
good
reason
for
the
break
to
exist
and
that
it
will
shortli
be
heal
but
how
can
one
deni
that
it
doe
in
fact
exist
it
seem
to
me
that
you
are
in
grave
danger
of
destroy
the
thing
you
are
tri
to
reform
the
power
of
the
papaci
what
good
will
it
do
you
if
you
becom
reconcil
to
the
the
pope
in
the
futur
but
in
the
process
you
have
destroy
hi
abil
to
use
the
tool
of
church
disciplin
it
one
thing
to
hold
that
the
pope
ha
misus
hi
power
and
excommun
someon
wrongli
it
someth
el
to
say
that
hi
excommun
did
not
take
effect
and
the
schism
is
all
in
hi
imagin
that
mean
that
act
of
church
disciplin
are
not
legal
tool
but
act
whose
valid
is
open
to
debat

it
ha
been

who
have
had
problem
with
the
pope
while
they
have
often
object
to

they
have

you
are
now
open

to
