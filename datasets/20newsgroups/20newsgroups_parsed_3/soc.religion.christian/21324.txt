and
proceed
not

by

the
scientif
method
is

accept
it
a

object
which
do
not
take
an
interest
in
the
experi
scienc
doe
not
progress
via
experiment
but
by
philosophis
one
aim
of
experi
is
to
investig
the
valid
of
the
hypthes
result
from
the
model
produc
by
thi
think
process
the
arrog
of
scienc
is
the
assumpt

that
the

scienc
ha
one
advantag
of

it
further
arrog
is
the
assumpt

aris
that
sinc
scienc
is
the
onli
valid
method
of

everyth
which
exist
must
be
the
sort
of

can
studi

that
if

sinc
these
asumpt
about
the
natur

can
not
themselv
be
made
the
subject
of
experi
it
is
bad
scienc
to
believ
them
a
well
a
arrog
illog
and
just
plain
sloppi
think
the
purpos
of
scienc
is
to
produc
a
model
of
the
physic
world
the
model
must
be
abl
to
explain
all
past
observ
and
predict
the
outcom
of
futur
observ
one
of
the
aim
of
experi
is
to
carri
out
well
defin
observ
which
are

ideal
scientist
will
except
the
model
which
best
describ
the
world
and
the
model
which
realis
on
the
minim
number
of
assumpt
at
the
moment
model
which
do
not
reli
on
the
assumpt
of
some

are
equal
power
to
one
which
assum
the
assumpt
of
a

ha
fewer
assumpt
it
should
be
the
current
accept
model
the
scientif

never
assum
that
it
present
model
are
the
correct
one
wherea

the
arrog
of
mani
theist
is
that
they
