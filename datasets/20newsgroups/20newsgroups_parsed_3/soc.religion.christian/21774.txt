subject
mari
and
idol
i
have
been
studi
the
bibl
now
for
about
a
year
i
love
it
but
i
am
not
veri
familiar
with
the
differ
denomin
or
tradit
or
common
belief
of
variou
christian
group
i
have
heard
variou
peopl
outsid
thi
news
group
describ
idol
such
a
power
money
materi
posse
etc
these
thing
are
worship
in
some
sen
i
suppos
but
i
never
realli
gave
idol
much
thought
until
now
i
have
been
read
the
post
in
thi
news
group
which
i
just
found
a
few
day
ago
and
i
have
a
question
first
im
not
tri
to
question
anyon
belief
or
tri
to
push
my
view
on
anyon
el
i
havent
been
at
thi
long
enough
to
have
ani
view
other
than
i
can
not
get
to
heaven
by
be
good
i
must
understand
that
christ
bore
my
sin
on
the
cross
so
that
i
could
be
save
and
i
need
to
repent
ie
realiz
that
everi
time
i
sin
i
might
a
well
stick
a
sharp
stick
in
christ
side
becaus
he
took
the
punish
for
my
sin
when
he
die
on
the
cross
in
my
studi
mari
never
realli
come
up
i
know
who
she
is
but
that
about
it
it
seem
to
me
that
a
statu
of
mari
could
be
consid
an
idol
do
peopl
pray
to
statu
of
mari
it
sound
like
educ
christian
more
educ
than
myself
im
sure
believ
mari
wa
sinless
wow
i
hope
to
spend
the
summer
convinc
myself
one
way
or
the
other
about
tongu
im
read
charismat
chao
i
guess
ill
studi
tongu
in
parallel
with
read
thi
news
group
ani
help
you
can
give
me
will
be
appreci
i
dont
think
the
issu
is
so
much
that
peopl
are
more
educ
than
you
though
it
may
well
be
that
they
are
a
that
they
come
from
a
differ
tradit
than
your
thi
is
a
discus
between
cathol
and
protest
cathol
gener
believ
that
mari
wa
sinless
protest
do
not
the
issu
come
down
to
differ
sourc
of
author
protest
gener
limit
themselv
to
the
bibl
a
a
sourc
of
doctrin
sinc
thi
isnt
in
the
bibl
except
in
passag
that
no
one
would
understand
in
thi
way
if
they
didnt
alreadi
believ
it
protest
dont
accept
it
cathol
see
continu
revel
through
the
church
though
they
believ
the
result
are
consist
with
the
bibl
i
interpret
your
post
not
a
a
call
for
yet
anoth
argument
about
whether
the
cathol
marian
devot
are
idolatri
an
argument
i
am
not
prepar
to
see
new
here
but
a
a
sign
of
be
interest
in
learn
about
tradit
other
than
your
own
cathol
are
of
cours
a
major
one
but
by
no
mean
the
onli
one
i
gener
consid
the
major
tradit
to
be
cathol
orthodox
and
variou
subset
of
protestant
within
protestant
it
a
matter
of
how
fine
you
want
to
cut
thing
these
day
i
think
the
major
divis
is
between
those
who
accept
biblic
inerr
and
those
who
dont
there
are
also
a
number
of
major
histor
tradit
but
in
recent
decad
distinct
are
tend
to
blur
id
identifi
the
major
protest
tradit
a
lutheran
reform
anglican
theyr
sort
of
halfway
between
cathol
and
protest
wesleyan
baptist
holi
pentecost
church
of
christ
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
histor
distinct
tend
not
to
be
so
import
among
the
liber
church
anymor
and
i
think
current
trend
in
societi
and
the
church
are
also
tend
to
make
conserv
seen
themselv
a
alli
from
a
gener
evangel
perspect
but
differ
among
these
variou
tradit
are
still
quit
mark
i
think
the
best
introduct
to
these
issu
is
to
read
a
good
book
on
church
histori
anyon
who
want
to
understand
the
church
realli
need
to
understand
how
we
got
where
we
are
now
a
church
histori
will
normal
show
you
where
each
of
these
tradit
came
from
and
give
a
feel
for
their
natur
unfortun
im
away
from
my
librari
at
the
moment
so
i
dont
have
anyth
specif
to
recommend
clh
