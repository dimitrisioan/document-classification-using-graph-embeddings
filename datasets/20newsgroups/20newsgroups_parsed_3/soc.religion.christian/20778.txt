thank
collect
all
peopl
who
have
given
good
answer
to
my
question
in
my
followup
to
jason
smith
post
i
will
address
some
issu
that
have
caus
misunderstand
jason

wrote
in
articl
petri
pihko
write
i
also
conced
that
i
wa
doubli
remiss
a
i
assert
no
reason
altern
exist
an
entir
subject
statement
on
my
part
and
one
that
could
be
invalid
given
time
and
further
discoveri
by
the
scientist
i
also
understand
that
a
prove
a
theori
doe
not
necessarili
specifi
that
thi
is
how
it
happen
but
propos
a
like
descript
of
the
phenomenon
in
question
am
i
mistaken
with
thi
understand
ye
to
some
degre
there
wa
an
excel
discus
in
sciskept
on
the
natur
of
scientif
work
two
week
ago
i
hope
it
did
not
escap
your
notic
the
correct
word
is
like
there
is
no
way
to
be
sure
our
model
and
theori
are
absolut
correct
theori
are
back
up
by
evid
but
not
prove
no
theori
can
be
true
in
a
mathemat
sen
howev
theori
are
not
mere
descript
or
rationalis
of
phenomenon
it
is
extrem
import
to
test
whether
theori
can
predict
someth
new
or
not
yet
observ
all
success
theori
scienc
ha
come
up
with
have
pas
thi
test
includ
the
big
bang
theori
of
cosmic
evolut
the
theori
of
natur
select
etc
it
doe
not
mean
they
must
be
correct
but
they
are
not
mere
best
fit
for
the
data
but
if
you
claim
that
there
must
be
an
answer
to
how
did
the
univers
our
spacetim
emerg
from
noth
scienc
ha
some
good
candid
for
an
answer
all
of
which
requir
someth
we
christian
readili
admit
to
faith
well
ye
if
you
want
to
believ
in
them
thi
is
not
what
scienc
requir
take
a
good
look
at
the
theori
and
the
evid
see
if
the
theori
ha
made
ani
success
predict
and
use
your
reason
disbeliev
are
not
punish
the
fact
that
there
are
sever
candid
beli
that
none
are
conclus
with
out
conclus
evid
we
are
left
with
faith
thi
is
what
puzzl
me
whi
do
we
need
to
have
faith
in
anyth
my
fellow
atheist
would
call
me
a
weak
atheist
someon
who
is
unabl
to
believ
ie
fail
to
entertain
ani
belief
in
god
ye
i
know
that
one
cant
believ
without
god
help
luther
make
thi
quit
clear
in
hi
letter
to
erasmu
im
afraid
thi
doe
not
chang
my
situat
a
coupl
of
paragraph
delet
summari
we
ask
whi
doe
the
univers
exist
i
think
thi
question
should
actual
be
split
into
two
part
name
whi
is
there
exist
whi
anyth
exist
and
how
did
the
univers
emerg
from
noth
delet
the
question
whi
anyth
exist
can
be
counter
by
demand
answer
to
a
question
whi
there
is
noth
in
nothing
or
in
nonexist
actual
both
question
turn
out
to
be
devoid
of
mean
thing
that
exist
do
and
thing
that
dont
exist
dont
exist
tautolog
at
it
best
care
examin
the
origin
question
and
then
the
counterquest
the
first
ask
whi
while
the
second
is
a
request
for
definit
no
it
is
not
although
it
doe
look
like
one
thi
is
a
true
dichotomi
either
someth
exist
or
noth
exist
if
noth
exist
nobodi
would
ask
whi
if
someth
exist
it
is
possibl
to
ask
whi
but
actual
no
exist
be
could
give
an
answer
imagin
for
a
moment
that
the
nobodi
in
nonexist
could
also
ask
whi
noth
exist
thi
is
equival
to
my
counterquest
whi
noth
exist
in
nothing
now
whi
anyth
exist
is
equival
to
whi
someth
exist
in
something
thi
is
what
i
meant
with
my
tautolog
my
apolog
for
the
poor
word
in
my
previou
post
i
might
add
the
worldview
of
thing
that
exist
do
and
thing
that
dontdont
is
a
ground
in
the
realm
of
the
nonfalsifi
a
doe
the
theist
belief
in
god
it
is
base
on
the
assumpt
that
there
is
not
a
reason
for
be
someth
a
ultim
unsupport
a
the
posit
of
there
be
a
reason
it
veri
foundat
exist
in
the
same
soil
a
that
of
one
who
claim
there
is
a
reason
i
do
inde
think
there
probabl
is
no
reason
for
be
or
exist
in
gener
for
reason
i
state
abov
howev
they
will
still
leav
open
the
question
whi
thi
and
not
that
and
thi
is
where
theistic
explan
come
in
scienc
can
not
give
reason
for
ani
particular
human
be
exist
we
come
to
thi
either
i
am
therefor
i
am
or
i
am
for
a
reason
thi
is
a
deep
philosoph
question
is
determin
true
or
not
also
is
god
determinist
or
not
i
tend
to
think
thi
question
ha
no
mean
in
hi
case
if
i
am
for
a
reason
ive
yet
fail
to
see
what
it
would
be
from
our
perspect
it
look
like
i
exist
for
truli
random
reason
i
just
roll
two
dice
whi
did
i
get
and
how
can
i
believ
there
is
ani
better
reason
for
my
exist
if
the
former
is
a
satisfactori
answer
then
you
are
done
for
you
are
satisfi
and
need
not
a
doctor
if
the
latter
your
search
is
just
begin
ye
i
am
satisfi
with
thi
reason
until
i
find
someth
better
my
year
of
christian
were
of
no
help
in
thi
respect
i
have
to
admit
but
i
am
patient
anoth
answer
is
that
god
is
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
sound
much
better
but
i
am
tempt
to
ask
doe
god
himself
exist
then
if
god
is
the
sourc
of
hi
own
exist
it
can
onli
mean
that
he
ha
in
term
of
human
time
alway
exist
but
thi
is
not
the
same
a
the
sourc
of
all
exist
thi
doe
not
preclud
hi
exist
it
onli
seek
to
identifi
hi
qualiti
impli
he
exist
to
have
qualiti
btw
no
it
doesnt
but
i
think
an
exist
god
can
not
know
whi
he
exist
for
an
answer
to
thi
question
is
not
knowabl
of
cours
thi
should
not
be
ani
obstacl
to
belief
in
hi
exist
i
also
have
discov
scienc
is
an
inadequ
tool
to
answer
whi
it
appear
that
m
pihko
agre
a
we
shall
see
but
becaus
a
tool
is
inadequ
to
answer
a
question
doe
not
preclud
the
question
assert
that
whi
is
an
invalid
question
doe
not
provid
an
answer
it
is
imposs
to
know
unknow
thing
howev
the
question
whi
do
i
exist
in
particular
is
not
an
invalid
question
thi
is
not
what
i
said
but
from
our
perspect
it
is
imposs
to
tell
and
i
cant
just
believ
in
ani
given
explan
instead
of
anoth
especi
sinc
i
found
i
wa
delud
myself
my
apolog
i
wa
use
whi
a
whi
did
thi
come
to
be
whi
did
preexist
becom
exist
whi
did
prespacetim
becom
spacetim
i
think
preexist
is
an
oxymoron
there
is
no
time
outsid
of
thi
spacetim
except
in
some
other
univers
and
from
that
perspect
our
univers
never
wa
it
exist
onli
for
those
who
are
insid
it
but
we
come
to
the
admiss
that
scienc
fail
to
answer
whi
becaus
it
cant
be
answer
in
the
realm
of
modern
scienc
doe
that
make
the
question
invalid
no
the
valid
of
the
question
ha
to
be
discus
separ
i
think
philosophi
is
of
great
help
here
what
can
be
known
and
what
is
not
knowabl
m
pihko
doe
present
a
good
point
though
we
may
need
to
ask
what
do
i
a
an
individu
christian
base
my
faith
on
will
it
be
shaken
by
the
product
of
evid
that
shatter
our
sacr
cow
or
will
we
seek
to
understand
if
a
new
discoveri
truli
disagre
with
what
god
said
and
continu
to
say
in
hi
word
thi
is
a
veri
good
question
in
tri
to
answer
thi
and
numer
other
question
that
bother
me
i
final
found
noth
to
base
my
faith
on
i
think
it
would
be
honest
if
we
all
ask
ourselv
whi
do
i
believ
or
whi
i
dont
believ
