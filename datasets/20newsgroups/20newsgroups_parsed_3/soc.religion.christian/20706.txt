thi
a
some
kinda
flame
thanx

advanc
i
want
to

whi
there

version
of
the
bibl
there

of
the
bibl
i
have
read
about
and
on
the
front
page

inaccur
data
and
inconsist
thanx
in
advanc
shaz
im
not
sure
quit
what
you
mean
by
mani
differ
version
the
primari
distinct
in
version
you
see
today
is
in
the
style
of
the
translat
it
pretti
unusu
to
see
signific
differ
in
mean
there
are
a
few
differ
in
the
underli
text
that
becaus
befor
print
manuscript
were
copi
by
hand
slight
differ
result
there
are
enough
manuscript
around
that
scholar
can
do
a
pretti
good
job
of
recreat
the
origin
but
there
are
some
uncertainti
fortun
they
are
gener
at
the
level
of
minor
differ
in
word
there
are
someth
like
or
place
where
whole
sentenc
are
involv
but
with
recent
discoveri
of
older
manuscript
i
dont
think
there
much
uncertainli
about
those
case
a
far
a
i
know
no
christian
believ
that
the
process
of
copi
manuscript
or
the
process
of
translat
is
free
of
error
but
i
also
dont
think
there
enough
uncertainti
in
establish
the
text
or
translat
it
that
it
ha
much
practic
effect
whether
the
bibl
contain
inaccur
data
and
inconsist
is
a
hot
topic
of
debat
here
mani
christian
deni
it
some
accept
it
though
most
would
say
that
the
inaccuraci
involv
are
on
detail
that
dont
affect
the
faith
but
thi
ha
noth
to
do
with
there
be
multipl
version
the
suppos
inconsist
can
be
found
in
all
the
version
im
surpris
to
find
a
refer
to
thi
on
the
titl
page
though
what
version
are
you
talk
about
ive
been
refer
to
major
scholarli

are
what
get
referenc
in
post
here
and
elsewher
there
have
certainli
been
edit
that
are
to
be
kind
le
wide
accept
thi
includ
everyth
from
reconstruct
that
combin
parallel
account
into
singl
narrat
to
edit
that
omit
materi
that
the
editor
object
to
for
some
reason
or
the
other
the
copyright
