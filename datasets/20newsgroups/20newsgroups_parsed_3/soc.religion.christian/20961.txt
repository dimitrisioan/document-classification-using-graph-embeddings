re
tuff
to
be
a
christian
plea
realiz
that
i
am
frequent
get
in
troubl
for
stray
from
orthodoxi
but
here
is
my
opinion
in
articl
no
name
write
moreov
the
buddha
say
that
we
are
intrins
good
a
against
christ
we
are
all
sinner
i
never
thought
of
these
two
idea
be
against
each
other
peopl
might
quibbl
about
what
intrins
mean
but
the
reason
we
are
sinner
is
becaus
we
do
not
behav
a
good
a
we
are
the
messag
of
christ
is
that
each
of
u
are
not
onli
good
but
great
that
we
can
approach
perfect
albeit
perhap
through
a
differ
techniqu
than
you
claim
buddhism
teach
becaus
we
do
not
realiz
our
great
we
sin
peter
had
no
problem
walk
on
water
until
a
littl
doubt
crept
in
doesnt
david
ask
in
the
th
psalm
what
is
man
that
you
god
should
care
for
him
but
you
have
made
him
just
a
littl
lower
than
the
angel
i
probabl
exager
in
my
mind
what
a
scrawni
littl
kid
david
wa
just
a
i
probabl
exager
what
a
gigant
monster
goliath
wa
but
david
power
easili
defeat
goliath
rememb
the
rich
young
man
who
come
up
to
jesu
and
ask
what
he
can
do
to
enter
the
kingdom
jesu
say
follow
the
command
i
alway
pictur
the
smug
look
on
hi
face
a
he
say
he
done
that
hi
whole
life
probabl
anticip
an
attaboy
from
the
messiah
instead
jesu
give
him
a
harder
task
sell
everyth
and
follow
him
jesu
is
rais
the
bar
the
descipl
say
how
can
anyon
do
thi
if
it
so
hard
even
for
rich
peopl
jesu
say
anyon
can
do
it
with
god
help
jesu
say
not
onli
can
we
avoid
kill
peopl
we
can
avoid
get
angri
at
peopl
not
onli
can
we
avoid
commit
adulteri
we
can
control
our
own
desir
i
realiz
thi
wa
not
your
main
point
but
i
wonder
how
other
peopl
see
thi
part
question
would
you
have
becom
a
christian
if
you
had
not
been
indoctrin
by
your
parent
you
probabl
never
learn
about
ani
other
religion
to
make
a
compar
studi
and
therefor
i
claim
you
are
brain
wash
plea
forgiv
ani
gener
i
am
about
to
make
your
point
about
how
hard
other
religion
are
is
a
good
one
just
a
your
part
question
is
a
tough
question
i
think
that
muslim
worship
the
same
god
a
i
do
we
can
learn
from
their
name
submiss
hindu
and
buddhist
and
taoist
etc
claim
that
god
is
imperson
is
god
person
or
imperson
i
say
ye
but
if
i
think
a
littl
more
my
answer
is
whichev
is
greater
i
think
it
is
greater
to
be
a
person
entiti
with
an
individu
conscious
but
your
right
that
that
might
be
a
cultur
bia
if
i
think
more
i
must
admit
that
god
person
natur
is
a
far
beyond
my
concept
a
hi
imperson
natur
is
beyond
the
hindu
concept
if
somehow
jesu
could
fit
into
hindu
cosmolog
then
mayb
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
though
that
is
hard
to
imagin
are
there
ani
former
or
present
eastern
religion
member
here
who
could
comment
