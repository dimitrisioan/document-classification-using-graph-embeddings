more
than

the
branch
davidian

actual
one
of

church
in
the
s
the
shephard
rod
broke
away
from
the
sda
church
becaus
they
felt
that
the
sda
church
wa
becom
weak
and
fall
into
apostaci
they
felt
that

about
in
revel
about
the
koresh
group
koresh
gain
control
of
it
in
or
onc
in

he
made
himself
the
center
of
it

proclaim
himself
a
christ
koresh
himself
came
from
an
sda
background
he
wa
excommun
a
a
young
adult
by
the
local
congreg
for
tri
to
exert
too
much
control
over
the
youth
in

he
join
the

davidian
they
werear
a
survivalist
cult

the
stockpil
of
weapon
food
a
bomb
shelter
etc
they
had
no
intent
of

govern
or
anyth
they
were
prepar
for
armaggedon
and
were
put
themselv

had
left
well
enough
alon
we
wouldn
t
have
the
blood
of

cri
out

if
you
want
to
know
about
the
shephard
rod
you
might
want
to
visit
the
local
sda
church
and
talk
to
some
of
the
older
peopl
they
could
give
you
some
insight
into
where
koresh
got
