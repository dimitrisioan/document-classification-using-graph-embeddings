refer
to
mari
she
wa
immacul
conceiv
and
so
never
subject
to
origin
sin
but
also
never
commit
a
person
sin
in
her
whole
life
thi
wa
possibl
becaus
of
the
special
degre
of
grace
grant
to
her
by
god
i
have
quit
a
problem
with
the
idea
that
mari
never
commit
a
sin
wa
mari
fulli
human
if
it
is
possibl
for
god
to
miracul
make
a
person
free
of
origin
sin
and
free
of
commit
sin
their
whole
life
then
what
is
the
purpos
of
the
incarn
of
jesu
whi
cant
god
just
repeat
the
miracl
done
for
mari
to
make
all
the
rest
of
u
sinless
without
the
need
for
repent
and
salvat
and
all
that
concept
of
mari
sinless
seem
to
me
to
be
at
odd
with
the
rest
of
christian
doctrin
a
i
understand
it
it
alway
a
twoway
street
god
gave
her
the
grace
to
avoid
sin
thu
when
she
wa
visit
by
gabriel
she
gave
her
fiat
her
total
accept
of
god
will
thi
fiat
summar
whi
cathol
regard
her
a
the
highest
of
all
human
that
god
chose
her
and
that
she
accept
know
thi
in
advanc
we
extrapol
that
she
wa
neither
stain
by
nor
subject
to
origin
sin
god
did
creat
u
all
miracul
free
to
choos
or
not
choos
to
sin
suffici
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
and
the
grace
of
god
to
command
it
thi
amount
of
grace
wa
precis
determin
by
god
to
be
the
amount
requir
to
do
what
god
ask
of
her
the
grace
given
to
each
of
u
is
also
enough
but
we
do
not
alway
choos
to
accept
it
we
also
believ
jesu
wa
fulli
human
and
never
sin
god
could
have
creat
a
much
better
person
than
myself
one
who
alway
chose
the
right
thing
