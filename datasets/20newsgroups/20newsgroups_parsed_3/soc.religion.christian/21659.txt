j
boswel
the
most
influenti
studi
of

is
that
of

wherea
the

a
passiv
sen
in

discus
of
the

he
cite
linguist
evid
and
common
sen
to
support
hi
conclus
that
the
word
mean
male
sexual
agent
ie
activ
male
prostitut
hi
argument
is
that
the
arseno
part
of
the
word
is
adjectiv
not
the
object
of
the
koitai
which
refer
to

interpret
on

and
the
histor
set
he
argu
that
in
some
compound
such
a
paidomath
child
learner
the
paido
is
the
subject
of
manthano
and
in
other
such
a
paidoporo
through
which
a
child
pas
the
paido
is
neither
subject
nor
object
but
simpli
a
modifi
without
verbal
signific
hi
point
is
that
each
compound
must
be
individu
analyz
for
it
mean
more
directli
he
maintain
that
compound
with
the
attic
form
arreno
employ

while
those
with

he
also
demonstr
it

conclud
there
is
no

believ
that
either
arsenokoitai

malakoi
connot

act
it
is
clear
throughout
that
boswel
defin
arsenokoitai
to
refer

he
even
goe
so
