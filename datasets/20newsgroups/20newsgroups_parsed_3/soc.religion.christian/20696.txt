scott
oser
write
in
articl
michael
covington
write
the
two
histor
fact
that
i
think
the
most
import
are
these
if
jesu
didnt
rise
from
the
dead
then
he
must
have
done
someth
el
equal
impress
in
order
to
creat
the
observ
amount
of
impact
nobodi
ever
display
the
dead
bodi
of
jesu
even
though
both
the
jewish
and
the
roman
author
would
have
gain
a
lot
by
do
so
it
would
have
discredit
the
christian
and
the
two
simplest
refut
are
these
what
impact
the
onli
record
of
impact
come
from
the
new
testament
i
have
no
guarante
that
it
book
are
in
the
least
accur
and
that
the
record
impact
actual
happen
i
find
it
interest
that
no
other
contemporari
sourc
record
an
eclips
an
earthquak
a
templ
curtain
be
torn
etc
the
earliest
written
claim
we
have
of
jesu
resurrect
is
from
the
paulin
epistl
none
of
which
were
written
sooner
than
year
after
the
suppos
event
it
seem
probabl
that
no
one
display
the
bodi
of
jesu
becaus
no
one
knew
where
it
wa
i
person
believ
that
the
most
like
explan
wa
that
the
bodi
wa
stolen
by
discipl
or
by
graverobb
dont
bother
with
the
point
about
the
guard
it
onli
appear
in
one
gospel
and
seem
like
exactli
the
sort
of
thing
earli
christian
might
make
up
in
order
to
counter
the
graverob
charg
the
new
testament
doe
record
that
jew
believ
the
bodi
had
been
stolen
if
there
were
realli
guard
they
could
not

claim
