are
all
truth
also
absolut
is
all
of
scriptur
truth
and
therefor
absolut
the
answer
to
both
question
is
ye
an
absolut
is
someth
that
is
constant
across
time
cultur
situat
etc
true
in
everi
instanc
possibl
do
you
agre
with
thi
definit
ye
i
do
agre
with
your
definit
exampl
of
woman
cover
their
head
and
not
speak
hold
it
i
said
that
all
of
scriptur
is
true
howev
discern
exactli
what
jesu
paul
and
compani
were
tri
to
say
is
not
alway
so
easi
i
dont
believ
that
paul
wa
tri
to
say
that
all
woman
should
behav
that
way
rather
he
wa
tri
to
say
that
under
the
circumst
at
the
time
the
woman
he
wa
speak
to
would
best
avoid
volubl
and
cover
their
head
thi
ha
to
do
with
maintain
a
proper
wit
toward
other
rememb
that
ani
number
of
relativist
statement
can
be
deriv
from
absolut
for
instanc
it
is
absolut
right
for
christian
to
strive
for
peac
howev
thi
doe
not
rule
out
tri
to
maintain
world
peac
by
resort
to
violenc
on
occas
ye
my
opinion
i
agre
that
there
is
truth
in
scriptur
there
are
principl
to
be
learn
from
it
claim
that
that
truth
is
absolut
though
seem
to
impli
a
liter
read
of
the
bibl
if
it
were
absolut
truth
constant
across
time
cultur
etc
then
no
interpret
would
be
necessari
it
may
be
that
the
lesson
glean
from
variou
passag
are
differ
from
person
to
person
to
me
that
doesnt
mean
that
one
person
is
right
and
the
other
is
wrong
i
believ
that
god
transcend
our
simpl
mind
and
that
scriptur
may
veri
well
have
been
craft
with
exactli
thi
intent
god
know
me
and
know
that
my
need
are
differ
from
your
or
anyon
el
by
claim
that
scriptur
is
absolut
then
at
least
one
person
in
everi
disput
interpret
must
be
wrong
i
just
dont
believ
that
god
is
that
rigid
evangel
are
clearli
not
take
thi
particular
part
of
scriptur
to
be
absolut
truth
and
there
are
plenti
of
other
exampl
can
you
reconcil
thi
sure
the
bibl
preach
absolut
truth
howev
exactli
what
those
truth
are
is
sometim
a
matter
of
confus
a
i
said
the
bibl
doe
preach
absolut
truth
sometim
those
fundament
principl
are
crystal
clear
at
least
to
evangel
thi
is
where
the
arrog
come
in
to
play
sinc
these
principl
are
crystal
clear
to
evangel
mayb
the
rest
of
u
should
just
take
their
word
for
it
mayb
it
isnt
at
all
crystal
clear
to
me
that
their
fundament
principl
are
either
fundament
or
principl
i
think
weve
establish
that
figur
out
biblic
truth
is
a
matter
of
human
interpret
and
therefor
errorpron
yet
you
can
still
claim
that
some
of
them
may
be
crystal
clear
mayb
to
a
certain
segment
of
christian
but
to
all
it
veri
difficult
to
see
how
you
can
claim
someth
which
is
base
on
your
own
interpret
is
absolut
god
reveal
hi
truth
to
the
world
through
hi
word
it
is
utterli
unavoid
howev
that
some
peopl
whill
come
up
with
altern
interpret
practic
anyth
can
be
misinterpret
especi
when
it
come
to
matter
of
right
and
wrong
care
to
deni
that
not
at
all
i
think
it
support
my
posit
much
more
effect
than
your
so
i
think
that
your
posit
is
the
bibl
is
absolut
truth
but
a
we
are
prone
to
error
in
our
interpret
we
can
not
reliabl
determin
if
we
have
figur
out
what
that
truth
is
did
i
get
that
right
what
the
point
of
spend
all
thi
time
claim
and
defend
absolut
truth
when
we
can
never
know
what
those
truth
are
and
we
can
never
or
at
least
shouldnt
act
upon
them
what
practic
differ
can
thi
