christian
homosexu
part
of
thi
is
a
continu
of
an
earlier
post
michael
siemon
write
for
those
christian
who
do
think
that
some
part
of
leviticu
can
be
law
for
christian
while
other
are
not
even
to
be
thought
about
it
is
incumb
on
you
in
everi
case
handl
on
it
own
merit
to
determin
whi
you
pick
one
and
ignor
anoth
i
frankli
think
the
whole
effort
misguid
reread
paul
no
doubt
i
am
free
to
do
anyth
but
christian
have
a
criterion
to
use
for
make
our
judgment
on
thi
the
great
command
of
love
for
god
and
neighbor
if
you
can
not
go
through
leviticu
and
decid
each
command
there
on
that
basi
then
your
own
arbitrari
select
from
it
is
simpli
idiosyncraci
in
thi
context
it
is
remark
offens
to
say
i
notic
that
the
vers
forbid
bestial
immedi
follow
the
vers
prohibit
what
appear
to
be
homosexu
intercours
i
am
sorri
you
found
thi
offens
it
wa
not
my
intent
to
offend
i
wa
lead
up
to
anoth
point
which
i
discu
in
more
detail
below
well
latida
so
what
thi
is
almost
a
slimey
an
argument
a
the
one
that
homosexu
rape
i
know
of
no
one
who
argu
serious
though
one
can
alway
find
joker
in
defens
of
bestial
it
is
absolut
irrelev
and
incompar
to
the
issu
gay
christian
do
rais
which
concern
sexual
activ
within
commit
consensu
human
adult
realtionship
so
that
your
bring
it
up
is
no
more
relev
than
the
law
of
kashrut
if
you
can
not
address
the
actual
issu
you
are
be
bloodi
dishonest
in
trail
thi
red
her
in
front
of
the
world
if
you
want
to
address
bestial
that
is
your
busi
not
mine
and
attempt
to
torpedo
a
seriou
issu
by
use
what
is
in
our
cultur
a
ridicul
joke
show
that
you
have
no
interest
in
hear
u
a
human
be
you
want
to
dismiss
u
and
use
the
sleaziest
mean
you
can
think
of
to
do
so
i
can
see
you
have
a
revuls
for
bestial
that
far
exce
my
distast
for
homosexu
certainli
if
i
spoke
about
homosexu
the
way
you
speak
of
bestial
nobodi
would
have
ani
troubl
label
me
a
homophob
let
me
ask
thi
gentli
whi
are
you
so
judgement
of
other
peopl
sexual
prefer
what
happen
to
no
doubt
i
am
free
to
do
anyth
i
think
you
have
a
seriou
doubl
standard
here
when
you
describ
a
comparison
between
homosexu
and
bestial
a
slimey
and
sleazi
you
are
make
an
implicit
judgement
that
bestial
is
pervert
sin
disgust
unnaturalin
short
all
the
thing
that
societi
onc
thought
about
homosexu
not
all
peopl
share
your
view
you
claim
not
to
know
ani
sincer
zoophil
but
thi
doe
not
mean
that
they
do
not
exist
they
even
have
their
own
newsgroup
altsexbesti
are
you
go
to
accus
them
all
of
be
mere
joker
i
notic
you
delet
the
main
point
of
my
comment
the
fact
that
the
onli
biblic
condemn
of
bestial
occur
in
connect
with
the
levit
prohibit
against
homosexu
while
there
are
some
new
testament
passag
that
can
arguabl
be
taken
a
condemn
homosexu
there
are
none
that
condemn
bestial
one
of
your
main
point
seem
to
be
that
christian
homosexu
is
accept
due
to
the
lack
of
ani
clear
new
testament
statement
against
it
if
thi
is
a
valid
argument
then
should
not
christian
zoophilia
be
made
that
much
more
accept
by
the
fact
that
the
new
testament
make
no
refer
clear
or
unclear
to
the
subject
at
all
i
am
quit
seriou
here
if
i
am
go
to
accept
homosexu
a
biblic
accept
on
the
basi
of
your
argument
then
i
am
go
to
be
fair
and
appli
the
same
standard
to
everyon
el
declar
sexual
prefer
a
well
if
the
argument
you
make
for
homosexu
can
be
appli
to
other
sexual
prefer
a
well
im
go
to
appli
them
and
see
what
come
up
im
not
tri
to
torpedo
a
seriou
issu
by
use
what
you
label
a
ridicul
joke
i
post
a
question
about
how
we
should
interpret
biblic
guidelin
for
christian
sexual
and
i
dont
think
such
a
question
is
irrelev
in
a
group
call
socreligionchristian
the
bibl
discu
homosexu
and
bestial
togeth
in
the
same
context
and
therefor
i
feel
i
have
a
good
preced
for
do
the
same
jesu
and
paul
both
expound
veri
explictli
and
in
consider
length
the
central
linchpin
of
christian
moral
thought
we
are
requir
to
love
one
anoth
and
all
els
depend
on
that
gay
and
lesbian
christ
ian
challeng
you
to
address
the
issu
on
those
term
and
all
we
get
in
return
are
cheap
debat
trick
attempt
to
sidetrack
the
issu
i
dont
know
whether
it
make
ani
differ
but
for
the
record
thi
is
not
a
side
issu
for
me
i
believ
love
one
anoth
includ
not
encourag
peopl
to
defil
themselv
therefor
it
is
of
high
import
to
determin
whether
god
regard
certain
sexual
act
a
defil
i
can
read
in
the
new
testament
that
god
ha
join
togeth
heterosexu
coupl
and
that
the
marriag
bed
is
undefil
i
can
read
in
the
old
testament
that
homosexu
intercours
and
bestial
defil
a
person
whether
or
not
that
person
is
under
the
law
if
gay
christian
can
validli
put
asid
the
old
testament
standard
of
defil
then
i
want
to
know
so
that
i
can
fairli
appli
it
to
all
the
sexual
practic
that
defil
a
person
in
the
old
day
i
dont
think
it
right
to
take
just
bit
and
piec
of
the
law
and
tri
and
appli
them
to
christian
today
eg
bestial
still
defil
you
but
homosexu
doesnt
that
wa
pretti
much
what
you
said
earlier
right
you
use
differ
exampl
but
i
think
you
said
essenti
the
same
thing
about
it
be
wrong
to
appli
onli
certain
part
of
the
law
to
christian
christian
no
doubt
veri
sincer
one
keep
show
up
here
and
in
everi
corner
of
usenet
and
the
world
and
all
they
ever
do
is
spout
these
same
old
vers
which
they
obvious
have
never
thought
about
mayb
never
even
read
in
total
ignor
of
the

rais

u
with
the
vilest
charg

whatev
their

what
it
is
it
wa
not

i

dont

im
afraid
i
naiv
assum
that

would
have
a
similar
attitud
pleas
note
that
i
have
never
intend
to
equat
homosexu
with
child
abus
i
have
mere
note
that
for
all
the
lack
of
clear
nt
condemn
of
homosexu
there
is
an
even
greater
lack
of
nt
condemn
or
even
mention
of
bestial
a
practic
which
a
number
of
peopl
eg
on
altsexbesti
consid
to
be
their
true
sexual
orient
such
behavior
should
shame
anyon
who
claim
to
have
seen
truth
in
christ
whi
for
god
preciou
sake
do
you
peopl
quot
irrelev
vers
to
condemn
peopl
you
dont
know
and
wont
even
take
the
troubl
to
listen
to
befor
you
start
your
condemn
is
that
love
your
neighbor
god
forbid
is
that
how
you
obey
the
repeat
command
to
not
judg
or
condemn
other
christ
and
paul
spend
order
of
magnitud
more
time
in
insist
on
thi
than
the
halfdozen
obscur
word
in
paul
that
you
are
so
bloodi
readi
to
take
a
licens
to
do
what
god
tell
you
not
to
do
whi
for
god
sake
quot
from
john
ff
omit
for
breviti
thi
is
an
excel
question
and
i
pray
that
you
will
not
treat
it
a
a
mere
rhetor
question
but
will
genuin
seek
to
discov
and
understand
the
answer
i
recommend
you
begin
with
a
littl
introspect
into
whi
you
yourself
have
much
the
same
attitud
toward
zoophilia
whi
do
you
find
bestial
so
repugn
that
you
regard
it
a
slander
to
even
mention
in
connect
with
other
altern
sexual
orient
whi
do
you
not
appli
all
the
same
vers
about
love
and
toler
to
zoophil
the
way
you
appli
them
to
homosexu
is
it
becaus
you
automat
experi
a
subject
feel
of
revuls
at
the
thought
a
lot
of
peopl
have
the
same
experi
at
the
thought
of
homosexu
intercours
is
it
becaus
you
regard
the
practic
a
social
unaccept
a
lot
of
peopl
regard
homosexu
a
social
unaccept
do
you
feel
that
it
violat
the
tradit
judeochristian
standard
of
sexual
moral
mani
peopl
feel
that
homosexu
doe
do
you
feel
the
bibl
condemn
it
mani
peopl
think
the
bibl
say
more
to
condemn
homosexu
than
it
doe
to
condemn
bestial
whi
then
do
you
think
compar
bestial
with
homosexu
is
insult
to
homosexu
if
you
can
honestli
answer
thi
question
you
will
have
come
a
long
way
toward
understand
whi
mani
peopl
feel
the
same
way
about
homosexu
a
you
feel
about
bestial
also
pleas
note
that
i
am
not
in
ani
sens
condemn
peopl
i
am
mere
point
out
that
when
i
read
the
bibl
i
see
certain
sexual
practic
that
the
bibl
appear
to
condemn
eg
sex
outsid
of
marriag
when
i
say
i
think
adulteri
and
premarit
sex
are
sin
do
you
take
that
a
me
fail
to
love
my
neighbor
when
you
treat
bestial
a
someth
disgust
and
unmention
are
you
disobey
repeat
order
not
to
judg
or
condemn
other
when
you
say
other
christian
are
guilti
of
sin
by
condemn
you
and
judg
you
are
you
by
that
accus
make
yourself
guilti
of
the
same
offens
or
are
you
and
i
both
simpli
take
note
about
practic
the
bibl
brand
a
sin
and
leav
the
judgement
of
the
peopl
up
to
god
for
long
age
we
mani
of
u
have
been
confus
by
evil
counsel
from
evil
men
and
told
that
if
we
came
to
the
light
we
would
be
shame
and
reject
some
of
u
despair
and
took
to
cours
that
probabl
do
show
a
sin
shun
of
god
light
bless
are
those
whose
spirit
have
been
crush
by
the
selfright
they
shall
be
justifi
howev
we
have
seen
the
truth
and
the
truth
is
the
light
of
human
and
we
now
know
that
it
is
not
we
who
fear
the
light
but
our
enemi
who
fear
the
light
of
our
wit
and
will
do
everyth
they
can
to
shadow
it
with
the
dark
of
fals
wit
against
u
michael
l
siemon
i
say
you
are
god
son
of
the
most
high
all
of
you
nevertheless
or
you
shall
die
like
men
and
fall
like
ani
princ
psalm
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
the
abov
two
paragraph
if
you
mean
that
jesu
is
the
truth
and
that
he
accept
sinner
and
doe
not
reject
them
then
i
agre
if
we
were
not
sinner
then
we
would
not
need
a
savior
our
salvat
in
christ
howev
doe
not
mean
that
sin
is
now
irrelev
for
u
and
we
can
now
do
whatev
we
want
nor
doe
christ
grace
mean
that
those
who
refer
to
sin
a
sin
are
be
judgement
or
intoler
i
am
speak
in
gener
term
here
not
specif
about
homosexu
if
the
bibl
call
someth
sin
then
it
is
not
unreason
for
christian
to
call
it
sin
too
a
appli
to
christian
homosexu
i
think
the
onli
definit
author
on
christian
sexual
is
the
bibl
if
you
make
a
list
of
everyth
the
bibl
say
on
the
subject
of
homosexu
intercours
i
think
you
will
find
that
everi
vers
on
the
list
is
neg
and
condemn
at
worst
and
unclear
at
best
the
most
progay
statement
you
could
make
about
the
list
is
that
there
is
some
disput
about
the
new
testament
vers
which
mani
peopl
interpret
a
condemn
homosexu
intercours
that
is
from
a
gay
perspect
the
most
posit
thing
you
can
say
about
the
bibl
treatment
of
homosexu
is
that
some
vers
fail
to
clearli
condemn
it
that
it
jesu
declar
all
food
clean
the
council
at
jerusalem
declar
that
gentil
were
not
requir
to
keep
the
ritual
law
but
nobodi
ever
reclassifi
homosexu
intercours
from
be
an
abomin
deserv
of
death
to
be
an
accept
christian
practic
you
have
vers
describ
homosexu
intercours
a
an
abomin
that
defil
both
jew
under
the
law
and
gentil
not
under
the
law
and
you
have
some
vers
which
are
at
best
not
clear
but
which
some
peopl
believ
are
clear
in
their
condemn
of
homosexu
behavior
and
that
the
sum
total
of
what
the
bibl
say
about
samesex
intercours
i
can
appreci
from
person
experi
your
desir
to
have
everyth
simpl
cutanddri
blackandwhit
whatiw
isok
and
thosewhoopposemearewick
howev
i
do
not
think
the
bibl
make
your
case
a
definit
a
you
would
like
it
to
in
fact
i
dont
believ
it
say
anyth
posit
about
your
case
at
all
ye
i
know
the
vers
about
love
one
anoth
and
not
judg
one
anoth
but
that
not
realli
the
issu
is
it
you
know
and
admit
that
there
are
still
thing
that
are
sin
for
christian
to
do
sinc
you
say
it
is
wrong
for
christian
to
condemn
you
therefor
the
issu
is
whether
the
bibl
say
homosexu
intercours
is
a
sin
even
if
you
do
challeng
the
clariti
of
the
new
testament
vers
you
are
still
left
with
the
fact
that
the
onli
thing
the
bibl
doe
say
clearli
about
homosexu
intercours
is
that
it
is
an
abomin
that
defil
both
those
who
are
under
the
law
and
those
who
are
not
mark
actual
i
dont
think
the
reaction
to
the
comparis
with
bestial
is
base
on
bestialophobia
i
think
what
he
regard
a
slimey
is
the
rhetor
approach
of
connect
homosexu
and
bestial
most
peopl
who
accept
homosexu
take
a
radic
approach
to
the
law
they
regard
all
of
lev
a
not
bind
on
christian
the
argument
is
that
there
no
way
in
the
text
to
separ
bestial
homosexu
and
wear
mix
fabric
thi
doe
not
mean
that
such
peopl
have
no
limit
on
their
conduct
nor
doe
it
mean
that
they
accept
bestial
it
simpli
mean
that
their
sexual
ethic
doe
not
come
from
the
law
and
particularli
not
from
lev
clh
