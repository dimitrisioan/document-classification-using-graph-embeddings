weird
of
earli
christian
i
am
a
good
cathol
boy
a
convert
no
le
attract
by
the
ration
tradit
aquina
et
al
and
the
emot
authent
in
comp
with
the
faddish
of
anglican
to
roman
catholic
i
never
had
much
time
for
the
pope
or
ani
other
heirarch
but
i
did
and
do
believ
in
the
sacrement
system
i
alway
felt
quit
happi
to
look
down
my
nose
at
those
such
a
john
emeri
a
few
post
back
who
had
to
engag
in
circuit
textual
argument
to
prove
their
faith
entir
oblivi
to
the
fact
that
a
dozen
other
faith
can
do
the
same
with
miracl
too
and
that
sinc
their
argument
depend
on
the
belief
in
the
bibl
a
god
sole
revel
it
wa
not
veri
good
logic
to
argu
that
the
bibl
prove
god
no
i
wa
happi
to
accept
the
church
a
god
revel
it
wa
the
church
after
all
that
exist
befor
the
bibl
the
church
that
choos
under
grace
of
cours
the
canon
of
scriptur
protest
ludicros
i
thought
wa
shown
by
protest
breathtak
accept
of
luther
right
to
reject
a
dozen
or
so
book
he
dislik
but
recent
i
read
peter
brown
bodi
and
societi
it
is
veri
well
research
and
well
written
but
is
rais
some
veri
upset
question
the
earli
christian
were
weird
even
more
so
than
today
carzi
fundi
they
had
odd
view
on
sex
odder
view
on
the
bodi
total
ludicr
view
about
demon
and
distinctli
uncharit
view
about
other
human
be
now
the
question
is
thi
were
the
first
christian
just
a
weird
but
weve
got
use
to
them
or
did
the
pristin
fall
of
the
church
happen
within
one
gener
it
certainli
didnt
have
to
wait
until
the
triumph
of
the
church
under
constantin
if
so
wha
doe
thi
say
about
god
promis
to
alway
support
the
church
it
no
use
throw
the
usual
protest
pieti
about
the
church
not
be
an
organ
at
me
it
a
commun
or
it
is
noth
and
it
wa
the
earli
commun
that
were
weird
the
instit
church
wa
a
model
of
saniti
by
comparison
i
would
be
interest
in
seriou
cathol
and
orthodox
respons
to
thi
entir
seriou
issu
im
not
sure
it
is
an
issu
for
protest
with
their
soul
alon
with
jesu
approach
but
for
we
who
see
the
ecclesia
a
a
koinoia
over
time
and
space
the
weird
earli
christian
are
a
problem
thi
is
an
exagger
of
the
protest
view
mani
protest
have
a
strong
appreci
for
the
role
of
the
church
the
soul
alon
with
god
is
certainli
import
for
protest
but
it
by
no
mean
the
whole
stori
i
have
read
the
sort
of
histori
you
talk
about
a
you
point
out
protest
dont
have
quit
the
same
problem
you
do
becaus
we
believ
that
the
church
had
a
fall
at
some
point
howev
protest
mytholog
typic
place
the
fall
around
the
time
of
constantin
or
more
like
regard
it
a
happen
in
a
sort
of
cumul
fashion
start
from
constantin
but
get
wors
a
the
pope
accumul
power
dure
the
mediev
period
the
consequ
of
have
it
earlier
are
somewhat
worrisom
even
to
u
most
protest
accept
the
theolog
result
of
the
earli
ecumen
council
includ
such
item
a
the
triniti
and
incarn
inde
in
the
work
of
reform
such
a
luther
and
calvin
youll
find
church
father
such
a
augustin
quot
all
the
time
i
think
youll
find
mani
protest
resist
to
the
idea
that
the
earli
church
a
a
whole
wa
wierd
there
is
an
addit
problem
for
protest
that
i
dont
much
want
to
talk
about
in
thi
context
sinc
it
been
look
at
recent
that
the
question
of
whether
one
can
realli
think
of
augustin
and
other
father
a
be
protoprotest
their
view
on
mari
the
author
of
the
pope
etc
are
not
entir
congeni
to
protest
thought
one
thing
that
somewhat
worri
me
is
a
question
of
methodolog
there
are
certainli
plenti
of
wierd
peopl
in
the
earli
church
what
concern
me
is
that
they
may
be
overrepres
in
what
we
see
we
see
everi
christian
who
court
martyrdom
but
i
think
there
good
reason
to
believ
that
most
ordinari
christian
were
more
prudent
than
that
we
see
the
heroic
virgin
but
i
think
there
good
reason
to
think
that
mani
christian
were
happili
marri
i
cant
help
suspect
that
the
earli
church
had
the
same
rang
of
wierdo
and
sane
peopl
that
we
do
now
i
think
there
also
a
certain
level
of
revision
activ
in
histori
at
the
moment
i
dont
mean
that
theyr
manufactur
thing
out
of
whole
cloth
but
dont
you
think
there
might
be
a
tendenc
to
emphas
the
novel
