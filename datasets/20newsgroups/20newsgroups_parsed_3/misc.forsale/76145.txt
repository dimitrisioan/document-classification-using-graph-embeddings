would
like
or
best
offer
im
sure
that
the
motorola
is
worth
it
but
thi
kind
of
thing
ha
alway
mystifi
me
is
the
price
of
veri
good
new
dualband
fulli
synthas
ht
ye
ye
i
know
motorola
ht
are
bulletproof

plutoniumbas
indestruct
you
can
drive
a
tank
over
them
and
theyll
still
work
but
just
how
often
doe
that
come
up
whi
are
ham
will
and
they
are
to
spend
the
price
of
a
synthaszi
dualband
for
a
channel
xtal
rig
note
thi
is
not
a
flame
a
i
said
im
sure
thi
is
a
good
deal
for
thi
rig
im
just
amaz
that
it
is
a
good
deal
i
would
have
guess
that
a
channel
xtal
rig
could
never
be
worth
a
much
a
a
dual
bander
to
a
ham
no
matter
how
durabl
just
show
you
how
wrong
i
can
be
mike
npdi
these
are
my
opinion
