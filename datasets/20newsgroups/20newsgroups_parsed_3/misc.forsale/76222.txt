my
impress
that
net
etiquett
doe
not
allow
compani
to
use
the

advertis
their

the
net
is
not
suppos
to
be
a
dump
ground
for
free
ad
but
reserv
it
for
tripe
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
signific
improv
in
addit
to
improp
etiquett
thi
product
is
a
mail
list
use
for
gener
junk
mail
so
either
they
target
it
well
enough
to
pay
for
it
in
other
word
they
manag
to
send
it
to
peopl
who
want
the
stuff
in
which
case
it
is
junk
onli
for
the
rest
and
the
transact
cost
are
born
appropri
in
thi
case
or
they
go
bankrupt
seem
fair
to
me
am
i
correct
in

thi
is
improp
and
if
so
what
can
be
done
to

such
an
improp
use
you
could
hold
your

you
could
kill

a
they
