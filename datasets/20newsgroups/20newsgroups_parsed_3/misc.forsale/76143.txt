lemon
a
i
understand
most
peopl
sell
thing
over
the
net
do
not
grant
a
warrantyi
am
in
such
a
situat
that
the
seller
did
not
state
whether
a
warranti
would
be
grant
or
not
and
the
item
i
receiv
is
out
of
order
the
seller
insist
that
it
wa
in
good
condit
when
he
sent
it
and
so
would
just
return
half
ofth
amount
that
i
paid
if
i
send
the
item
back
to
him
and
after
he
is
sure
it
is
bad

thi
reason
basic
i
would
like
to
believ
the
seller
tell
the
truth
also

am
posit
to
say

ive
not
done
anyth
wrong

know
there
is
such
