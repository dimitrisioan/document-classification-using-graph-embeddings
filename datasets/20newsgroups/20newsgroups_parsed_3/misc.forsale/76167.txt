i
had
the
front
panel
of
my
car
stereo
stolen
thi
weekend
i
need
to
buy
the
front
panel
of
a
soni
xru
car
stereo
i
wa
my
understand
that
the
purpos
of
those
removeablefrontpanel
were
to
make
the
radio
useless
and
thu
discourag
theft
that
is
if
the
cover
were
remov
by
the
owner
and
taken
along
whenev
the
car
wa
left
if
those
cover
were
sold
for
anyth
remark
le
than
the
radio
origin
cost
or
even
sold
at
all
then
the
abov
discourag
wouldnt
be
so
great
i
person
would
be
unhappi
if
i
bought
a
radio
like
that
think
that
remov
the
cover
greatli
depreci
the
radio
valu
and
the
cover
were
sold
by
the
compani
or
other
legitim
sourc
cheapli
the
front
cover
should
be
avail
from
soni
check
with
a
local
car
stereo
shop
you
will
probabl
definit
have
to
provid
the
unit
serial
number
and
hope
you
had
regist
the
warranti
card
i
dont
know
the
cost
but
replac
have
to
be
avail
to
peopl
who
damag
the
face
cover
so
it
stand
to
reason
that
it
can
be
replac
a
to
deter
theft
when
i
work
for
a
stereo
shop
we
refer
the
custom
to
a
soni
number
we
would
not
sell
the
face
nor
did
we
have
them
avail
most
peopl
who
came
in
ask
for
the
face
cover
or
a
pullout
sleav
for
that
matter
would
look
veri
dishearten
to
find
that
they
acquir
a
deck
they
couldnt
use
if
theft
occur
with
these
deck
notifi
soni
serial
number
do
catch
theiv
just
a
thought
