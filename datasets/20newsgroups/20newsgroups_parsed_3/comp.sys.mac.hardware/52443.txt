but
mention
problem
with
the
floppi

and
intermitt
problem
with
print
file
it
sound
to
me
like
they
were
have
both
hardwar

and
softwar
compat
problem
with
the
machin
he
not
recommend
the
centri
to
anybodi
he

to
consid
a

or
a
iivx
whi
he
would
recommend
a
iivx
over
an
lciii
i
dont

jay

sound
to
me
like
your
dealer
realli
want
to
get
rid
of
the
iivx
he
ha
in
stock
i
can
imag
that
they
are
get
hard
to
sell
given
that
a
c
is
way
faster
and
is
compar
in
price
an
lciii
is
about
the
same
speed
and
is
way
cheaper
so
your
dealer
may
well
be
tri
a
hard
a
he
can
to
convinc
peopl
that
iivx
are
a
much
better
buy
than
a
c
just
so
he
can
get
rid
of
all
hi
old
stock
no
disrespect
to
dealer
or
the
iivx
