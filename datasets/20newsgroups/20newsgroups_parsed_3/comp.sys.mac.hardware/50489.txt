have
no
intent
of
chang
the
way
i
post
i
instal
a
coupl
of
mb
simm
in
my
quadra
and
wa
somewhat
dismay
by
the
gener
complex
of
the
oper
compar
to
for
exampl
the
wonder
design
lc
iii
it
irrit
me
when
appl
refus
to
tell
how
to
do
it
in
the
user
manual
so
you
have
to
guess
at
how
to
disassembl
the
devi
in
question
it
the
same
for
ad
memori
to
laserwrit
pro
it
isnt
appl
respons
to
tell
it
custom
how
to
fool
around
with
it
hardwar
that
is
what
appl
servic
tech
get
paid
to
do
i
person
like
the
design
of
the
q
and
applaud
appl
for
come
up
with
a
good
way
to
make
use
of
the
front
space
for
all
of
those
drive
bay
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
the
design
except
for
those
peopl
who
need
drive
array
i
do
howev
agre
with
you
about
the
lw
pro
design
the
oper
isnt
veri
complic
if
even
a
minim
amount
of
help
were
offer
but
appl
leav
you
work
blind
again
it
not
appl
place
to
make
it
easi
for
noncertifi
servic
peopl
to
fool
around
with
appl
hardwar
even
if
they
did
buy
it
of
cours
you
are
free
to
do
what
you
want
to
your
mac
just
dont
get
upset
when
your
appl
servic
rep
tell
you
that
your
warranti
is
no
longer
valid
after
the
memori
wa
instal
i
wa
distraught
that
the
top
of
the
simm
came
into
contact
with
the
plastic
case
frame
mine
actual
contact
the
framework
with
quit
a
lot
of
pressur
enough
so
that
the
assembl
of
the
board
back
to
the
proper
posit
wa
rather
difficult
and
requir
some
forc
i
could
have
file
a
littl
excess
materi
off
the
top
of
the
simm
board
but
chose
to
let
it
stand
a
is
i
have
not
had
problem
with
ram
yet
so
i
will
consid
the
problem
annoy
but
not
catastroph
thi
sound
like
the
kind
of
problem
i
had
when
i
instal
mb
simm
into
an
lc
back
befor
lowprofil
mb
simm
were
readili
avail
the
standard
mb
simm
would
contact
the
top
of
the
case
and
make
it
a
bit
difficult
to
close
the
lc
but
it
did
close
and
work
just
fine
one
of
the
nice
thing
about
logicboard
is
that
they
are
gener
quit
flexibl
and
can
withstand
a
fair
amount
of
pressur
hade
