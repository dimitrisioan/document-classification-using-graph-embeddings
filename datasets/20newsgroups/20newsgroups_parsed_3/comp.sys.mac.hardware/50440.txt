the
second
bad

i
ask
la

a
new

but
they
said
no
also
within
three
week
after
i
purchas
my
origin
drive
la
cie
drop
the
price
on
it
by
over
i
can
accept
that
a
drive
or
two
may
be
bad
and
i
know
that
hardwar
vendor
make
a
practic
of
send
recondit
replac
when
they
do
repair
and
i
understand
that
the
natur
of
the
comput
industri
lend
itself
to
sudden
price
fluctuat
nevertheless
taken
togeth
the
converg
of
these
factsev
have
left
a
bad
tast
in
my
mouth
i
should
have
ad
abov
that
when
i
ask
la
cie
to
transfer
the
content
of
my
current
drive
to
the
one
they
will
sendi
think
the
data
is
still
in
good
shape
and
ill
have
to
again
reinstal
everyth
from
floppiesthey
said
it
would
cost
me
for
data
recoveri
it
seem
to
me
that
recondit
hardwar
should
be
sold
a
recondit
at
a
discount
price
and
that
replac
for
new
hardwar
gone
bad
still
cover
under
a
day
warranti
should
be
new

feel
a
littl
helpless
