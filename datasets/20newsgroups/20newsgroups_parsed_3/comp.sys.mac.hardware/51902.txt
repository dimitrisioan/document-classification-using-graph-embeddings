help

i
am
go
absolut
insan
i
wan
na
know
if
the
problem
is
my
duo
or
all
duo
s
or
all
duo
or
just
me
hmmm
sound
vagu
similar
to
a
problem
i
had
a
long
time
ago
when
i
wa
tri
to
use
kermit
i
wa
build
a
serial
connect
between
my
duo
and
my
next
i
think
the
problem
wa
in
the
handshak
basic
you
need
to
make
sure
that
the
handshak
protocol
is
the
same
on
both
side
a
safe
place
to
start
is
by
select
no
handshak
on
either
end
one
problem
is
that
the
zilog
serial
chip
seem
to
get
perman
wedg
if
you
talk
to
it
wrong
and
onli
a
reset
will
clear
it
i
dont
know
the
specif
but
thi
could
be
a
nonlinear
that
screw
up
your
attempt
at
debug
the
system
it
could
veri
well
be
that
you
are
do
thing
righteventu
but
one
wrong
move
like
tri
a
bad
handshak
protocol
can
screw
up
ani
further
correct
action
until
the
next
machin
reset
i
have
wedg
my
mac
and
also
my
next
that
way
now
i
can
send
file
back
and
forth
between
the
duo
and
the
next
without
ani
problem
and
at
pretti
high
speed
too
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
chip
the
pc
us
but
i
think
the
zilog
is
pretti
standard
hope
thi
help
averi
