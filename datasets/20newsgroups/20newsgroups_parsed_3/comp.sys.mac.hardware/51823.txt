math
coprocessor
option
my
purchas
agent
told
me
about
the
math
coprocessor
option
and
sent
me
the
appl
summari
document
to
prove
it
i
order
the
coprocessor
option
but
im
realli
not
sure
that
we
need
it
i
thought
the
chip
had
a
math
coprocessor
built
into
it
ha
appl
had
a
math
coprocessor
chip
architectur
to
keep
up
with
the
speed
of
the
chip
in
the
centri
i
am
concern
that
i
may
have
set
up
a
hardwar
bottleneck
appl
ha
realli
confus
peopl
with
thi
whole
thing
i
think
well
be
answer
thi
question
for
about
the
next
year
or
so
there
is
no
option
to
get
an
fpu
on
a
c
what
you
have
is
a
choic
of
cpu
there
is
the
lc
that
doe
not
have
an
integr
fpu
like
the
full
and
is
onli
present
in
the
base
model
of
the
c
appleusa
and
there
is
the
full
which
you
get
when
you
order
anyth
other
than
the
base
configur
therefor
sinc
you
have
order
one
of
the
mb
version
with
onboard
ethernet
model
you
will
not
be
get
the
lc
but
even
if
you
want
to
have
the
lc
you
wouldnt
be
abl
to
order
a
c
with
mb
ram
onboard
ethernet
and
an
lc
it
not
an
option
also
a
note
to
peopl
out
there
that
have
c
and
c
think
that
there
is
an
option
fpu
the
class
chip
can
not
recogn
an
extern
fpu
so
there
is
no
socket
on
the
motherboard
for
a
fpu
chip
and
you
can
not
go
out
and
purchas
an
fpu
on
a
pd
card
or
someth
like
that
the
onli
way
to
get
an
fpu
in
these
machin
is
to
replac
the
lc
with
a
full
and
if
you
have
a
c
you
will
not
need
to
worri
about
a
heat
sink
if
you
do
replac
the
lc
with
the
full
but
if
you
have
a
c
you
do
need
to
have
a
heat
sink
