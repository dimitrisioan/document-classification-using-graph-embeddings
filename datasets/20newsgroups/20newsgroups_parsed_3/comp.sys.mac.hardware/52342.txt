the
differ
between
a
comput

a
comput
scientist

about
mean
the
engin
make
more
than

the

not
just
a
joke
scott
for
the
most
part
thi
is
a
bunch
of
bunk
ive
got
a
comput
engin
degre
yet
ive
spent
the
last
year
write
softwar
that
peopl
actual
use
moreov
the
salari
distinct
are
incorrect
i
receiv
job
offer
upon
graduat
the
two
job
that
actual
use
my
hardwar
experi
were
year
lower
my
advic
is
to
decid
which
class
and
project
most
interest
you
and
pick
the
major
that
allow
you
to
take
them
emt
well
here
is
my
worth
advic
from
a
grad
student
i
agre
with
the
gentleman
who
wrote
the
comment
befor
me
the
import
thing
is
pick
what
ever
interest
you
the
most
and
learn
a
much
a
possibl
about
it
in
my
five
year
of
educ
in
thi
field
though
brief
compar
to
alot
of
peopl
i
had
to
think
about
thi
kind
of
question
a
lot
did
i
make
the
right
decis
in
go
into
electr
engin
a
oppos
to
comput
engin
or
c
the
more
i
go
thru
school
the
more
i
believ
that
thi
kind
of
question
is
irrelev
interest
a
i
think
comput
technolog
is
now
becom
widespread
enough
now
that
it
is
no
longer
a
posit
which
must
requir
a
degre
i
know
of
sever
peopl
i
work
with
that
make
just
a
much
a
i
do
and
they
dont
even
have
a
b
degre
in
comp
sci
yet
they
make
a
year
they
also
didnt
have
to
pay
grand
to
thier
local
univers
either
i
think
comput
program
is
be
reduc
to
a
trade
practic
than
a
truli
specialti
field
it
will
be
even
more
so
in
the
futur
if
your
interest
in
cut
edg
type
of
stuff
and
you
choos
c
a
i
did
i
suggest

emerg
field
of
softwar
