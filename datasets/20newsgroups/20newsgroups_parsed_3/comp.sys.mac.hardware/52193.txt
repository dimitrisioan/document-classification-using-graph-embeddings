we
are
have
a
problem
with
a
quadra
that
ha
stump
a
coupl
of
tech
sent
to
u
by
the
vendor
a
well
a
u
thi
quadra
is
stuf
with
mb
ram
mb
vram
and
some
larg
disk
mb
i
think
what
happen
is
that
after
a
certain
variabl
interv
of
time
the
video
circuitri
lose
vertic
sync
it
is
quit
appar
that
the
mac
cpu
is
still
ok
and
the
problem
realli
seem
to
lie
with
the
video
circuitri
sinc
you
can
still
save
your
document
quit
your
aplpic
even
pull
down
menu
etc
onli
the
display
is
scroll
lik
crazi
so
it
pretti
hard
to
hit
menu
item
we
had
the
origin
logic
board
replac
twice
now
and
the
same
problem
ha
been
occur
on
all
board
although
the
intev
between
occurr
ha
vari
the
first
board
had
thi
problem
everi
about
hr
more
often
if
the
cach
wa
turn
off
ye
off
thi
is
the
onli
symptom
that
is
not
obvious
relat
to
the
video
circuitri
after
all
the
cach
is
on
the
cpu
right
the
second
board
had
the
problem
everi
about
minut
we
did
not
keep
it
rather
we
put
the
origin
back
the
current
board
we
have
ha
thi
problem
a
lot
le
often
ha
gone
about
a
week
without
do
it
but
did
it
twice
within
an
hour
yesterday
the
technician
that
have
come
out
to
tri
to
figur
it
out
seem
pretti
sharp
and
tri
a
number
of
sensibl
thing
most
of
which
we
had
previous
tri
ourselv
anyway
these
includ
swap
the
ram
swap
the
vram
swap
monitor
differ
appl
rgb
and
appl
rgb
swap
cabl
disconnect
hd
and
boot
from
floppi
sacrif
variou
small
mammal
here
are
some
other
fact
when
we
put
a
rasterop
procolor
on
the
nubu
the
problem
is
fix
it
doe
not
occur
with
the
intern
video
or
the
procolor
video
out
the
vendor
can
not
reproduc
the
problem
back
in
their
shop
on
the
board
that
exhibit
it
in
our
lab
appl
is
said
to
be
get
a
littl
bit
piss
off
at
ship
u
board
that
they
can
not
find
anyth
wrong
with
and
get
them
ship
back
a
faulti
accord
to
u
here
are
some
specul
i
bet
that
neither
appl
nor
the
vendor
ha
test
these
board
with
that
much
ram
and
vram
on
them
simultanea
which
may
have
someth
to
do
with
their
find
it
hard
to
reproduc
the
problem
though
we
can
reproduc
it
with
just
mb
of
ram
so
thi
is
probabl
a
red
her
the
vendor
repres
blame
metal
in
your
wall
claim
that
our
wall
have
metal
in
them
which
interfer
with
the
mac
oper
we
have
anoth
in
the
lab
which
work
like
a
charm
though
it
not
in
the
exact
same
spot
plea
dont
tell
me
thi
is
probabl
it
i
do
not
want
to
believ
it
it
probabl
not
poltergeist

they
do
not
have
