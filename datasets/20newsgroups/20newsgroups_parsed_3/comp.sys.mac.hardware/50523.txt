you
should

think
of

it
is
easier
to

christian

i
thought
nec
and
toshiba
cdrom
mechan
have
an
averag
access
time
of
le
than
m
while
the
sonyappl
cdrom
drive
ha
an
access
time
of
m
for
the
doublespin
model
chung

i
have
the
a
cdtechnolog
drive
with
the
toshiba
mechan
and
it
is
supposedli
the
fast
and
best
now
it
ha
an
access
of
m
and
a
data
transfer
rate
kbsec
it
is
multisess
photocd
compat
it
is
avail
from
educorp
for
the
cdtechnolog
one
and
come
with
two
mail
in
coupon
for
two
free
cd
im
not
sure
if
the
cd
are
good
sinc
ive
onli
had
the
drive
a
littl
le
than
a
month
and
had
the
cd
ship
to
my
home
address
in
california
instead
of
here
in
maryland
the
cdtechnolog
drive
ha
a
separ
power
suppli
separ
from
the
drive
which
supposedli
give
it
a
longer
life
and
keep
it
cleaner
with
no
fan
to
attract
dust
a
toshiba
brand
drive
is
also
avail
but
i
think
the
cdtechnolog
is
better
sinc
you
get
the
same
mechan
and
at
a
slightli
lower
price
with
two
free
cd
the
appl
i
drive
soni
mechan
is
around
a
m
access
time
i
think
and
a
data
transfer
rate
of
kbsec
i
know
it
is
the
slowest
of
the
three
mention
here
it
is
not
wide
avail
except
through
the
appl
catalog
which
is
bad
at
a
price
of
onli
it
is
also
multisess
photo
cd
compat
i
think
the
extern
model
come
with
free
cd
some
of
which
are
pretti
good
the
nec
drive
ha
been
out
the
longest
it
ha
an
access
time
of
m
and
a
data
transfer
rate
of
kbsec
it
is
avail
from
mani
vendor
around
dollar
includ
educorp
it
wasnt
multisesss
photocd
compat
befor
but
i
hear
that
the
current
version
that
is
ship
is
owner
of
the
older
drive
can
get
an
upgrad
it
doe
not
come
with
ani
free
cd
unless
you
buy
it
in
a
bundl
of
the
three
cdrom
drive
abov
i
think
the
best
choic
would
be
the
appl
drive
and
the
cdtechnologytoshiba
drive
the
appl
drive
for
it
compat
with
appl
product
and
the
cdtechnologytoshiba
for
it
speed
and
perform
