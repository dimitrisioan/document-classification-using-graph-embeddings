anyth
about
thi
id
be
interest
in
the
cost
per
megabyt
and
the
approxim
cost
of
the
drive
itself
and
how
they
compar
to
the
bernoulli
i
think
you
must
be
talk
about
the
syquest
code
name
mesa
i
believ
it
is
a
winchest
technolog
drive
pretti
much
like
the
other
syquest
drive
in
term
of
how
it
work
accord
to
the
latest
macleak
the
drive
ha
a
m
access
time
mb
sustain
throughput
these
figur
are
from
memori
so
they
could
be
slightli
off
but
they
give
you
an
idea
of
perform
nonetheless
the
drive
wa
origin
releas
for
the
pc
and
just
recent
wa
releas
for
the
mac
world
dont
ask
me
what
the
differ
are
and
through
they
are
current
in
limit
suppli
accord
to
a
syquest
rep
they
are
in
the
process
of
ramp
up
for
mass
product
i
have
alreadi
seen
them
advertis
by
a
number
of
manufactur
in
macleak
includ
pli
massmicro
clubmac
and
macwarehous
powerus
the
pli
and
massmicro
unit
are
price
at
just
around
the
lesser
name
brand
are
go
for
around
for
an
extern
drive
cartridg
which
hold
mb
sell
for
about
each
at
these
price
the
drive
and
cartridg
are
cheaper
and
better
perform
than
the
mb
drive
cost
per
megabyt
compar
favor
with
other
cartridg
drive
and
bernoulli
drive
but
for
larg
amount
of
data
optic
is
still
cheaper
and
more
reliabl
person
im
excit
by
the
new
drive
and
look
forward
to
get
my
