a
mhz
osz
but
after
hour
my
quadra
die
i
am
not
sure
what
wa
the
reason
for
that
but
it
is
to
riski
to
run
it
to
fast
most
of
your
quadra
should
work
at
mhz
without
ani
problem
but
a
safeti
tip
do
a
backup
from
your
harddisk
befor
you
start
to
upgrad
dure
my
mhz
test
i
damag
my
harddisk
and
had
a
hardtim
to
get
it

a
backup

result
graphic
couldnt
belief
thi
but
it
is
true
two
point
which
my
caus
problem
are
the
mbyte
ram
solder
on
the
board
the
are
onli
n
ram
and
run
at
the
upperlimit
with
mhz
the
next
part
which
may
caus
troubl
are
the
video
ram
i
have
the
orign
n
vram
from
appl
in
my
quadra
here
you
are
also
at
the
upperlimit
where
most
of
the
chip
run
but
it
isnt
garanti
to
run
most
of
the
other
part
on
the
quadra
board
run
on
there
o
wn
clockspe
so
they
wont
make
trubl
the
most
importan
question
is
do
i
neat
a
new
heat
sink
i
would
say
no
after
run
my
quadra
for
more
than
hour
the
heat
sink
is
realli
cool
a
mhz
with
heat
sink
is
mutch
warmer
than
the
in
the
quadra
so
i
didnt
see
ani
problem
the
room
temperatur
wa
celsiu
f
if
you
live
in
a
area
were
it
is
hot
f
c
and
your
room
temperatur
is
not
mutch
below
i
would
suggest
a
new
heat
sink
with
a
ventil
to
stay
on
the
safe
side
hope
you
will
have
the
same
success
than
i
had
