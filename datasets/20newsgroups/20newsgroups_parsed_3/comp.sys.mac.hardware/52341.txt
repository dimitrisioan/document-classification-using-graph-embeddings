my
friend
recent
purchas
a
lc
iii
and
he
want
to
know
if
there
is
such
a
demon
call
nubu
adapt
for
hi
pd
slot
the
lc
famili
of
mac
can
onli
use
pd
card
they
are
not
abl
to
use
nubu
ah
but
whi
can
some
technicallyhip
macsling
tell
u
what
the
differ
is
between
pd
and
nubu
is
it
imposs
to
make
a
gadget
that
plug
into
pd
and
end
in
a
nubu
card
cage
at
least
marvin
friend
ha
not
been
abl
to
locat
one
and
neither
have
i
what
is
the
fundament
reason
for
thi
i
think
that
there
do
exist
nubu
expans
cage
im
sure
ive
seen
them
advertis
occassion
but
i
think
that
the
main
problem
is
that
they
cost
much
more
than
the
differ
in
price
between
say
a
lc
and
iivx
so
unless
you
need
lot
of
nubu
slot
it
not
worth
the
bother
of
cours
it
may
be
that
these
extra
box
are
so
expens
becaus
no
one
buy
them
becaus
they
