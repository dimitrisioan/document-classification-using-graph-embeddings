hi
i
own
an
lciii
and
i
recent
heard
an
interest
rumor
i
heard
that
the
lciii
ha
a
built
in
slot
for
a
powerpc
chip
is
thi
true
i
heard
that
the
slot
is
not
the
same
a
the
pd
slot
is
that
true
thank
david
mirski
well
i
also
have
an
lc
iii
pop
the
top
reveal
one
socket
for
an
addit
vram
simm
one
socket
for
a
pin
ram
simm
one
socket
for
a
flatpack
fpu
a
processordirect
slot
pd
ident
to
the
lclc
ii
but
with
an
addit
set
of
connet
to
one
side
for
the
full
bit
data
path
that
the
lclc
ii
lack
that
it
i
guess
a
board
with
a
powerpc
chip
could
be
made
that
would
fit
in
the
pd
but
that
the
onli
place
so
will
it
be
possibl
to
have
a
nubu
or
pd
powerpc
upgrad
or
will
it
requir
a
logic
board
swap
it
would
be
interest
for
appl
to
come
out
with
a
nubu
powerpc
that
allow
use
of
the
cpu
x
like
rocketshar
but
i
guess
that
get
a
bit
fantast
i
wa
wonder
sinc
macweek
report
that
develop
were
seed
with
powerpc
on
a
nubu
card
also
ani
word
on
machin
arriv
or
estim
speed
last
i
heard
the
estim
were
around
time
the
speed
of
a
quadra
in
nativ
risc
mode
i
heard
an
appl
employe
mumbl
someth
about
the
arriv
of
powerpc
machin
at
a
much
earlier
date
that
q
but
i
doubt
it
true
final
is
the
powerpc
develop
cd
minicours
avail
i
saw
it
advertis
in
the
develop
univers
calendar
and
id
like
to
know
if
it
at
all
interest
sean
radiu
specul
publicli
that
they
could
provid
a
powerpcbas
rocket
for
exist
mac
it
would
have
the
plu
of
rocketshar
and
the
minu
of
nubu
acceler
no
true
boot
off
the
acceler
nubu
bottleneck
to
video
and
other
io
appl
it
seem
will
not
compet
with
third
parti
here
except
perhap
for
notyetavail
mac
like
cyclon
where
a
powerpc
slot
might
be
advertis
look
for
daystar
and
such
to
make
powerpc
acceler
one
potenti
problem
with
ani
acceler
though
is
that
it
will
need
a
rom
companion
and
appl
ha
licens
onli
radiu
with
rocketshar
to
use
ani
of
it
proprietari
code
appl
is
between
the
line
tri
to
let
u
know
that
powerpc
mac
will
have
simplifi
logic
board
due
to
the
magic
natur
of
risc
and
that
these
board
should
be
much
cheaper
to
build
than
those
in
exist
mac
perhap
then
well
see
groundbreak
price
in
maclog
board
upgrad
much
the
same
way
weve
seen
much
cheaper
highperform
cpu
thi
year
first
gener
powerpc
s
will
also
hope
have
socket
cpu
so
that
theyll
be
chip
upgrad
to
s
a
year
later
thi
should
be
possibl
in
much
the
same
way
that
s
can
be
pull
for
clock
doubler
if
there
is
too
much
technic
baggag
which
i
doubt
sinc
the
extern
bus
are
the
same
sizewidth
to
do
thi
perhap
we
can
have
cpu
daughterboard
a
la
powerbook
a
standard
to
facilit
better
cpu
upgrad
thi
is
an
area
where
appl
ha
fallen
far
behe
the
intelbas
world
perhap
catchup
is
in
order
by
the
way
last
week
pc
week
had
an
excel
stori
on
powerpc
pentium
mip
r
dec
alpha
the
big
four
on
the
microprocessor
front
for
the
forseeabl
futur
worth
read
for
technojunki
also
the
latest
pc
ha
a
cover
stori
on
pentium
read
it
and
all
the
other
stori
about
how
intel
is
unstopp
and
preemin
right
now
onc
anyon
is
thi
secur
they
are
due
to
fall
intel
market
posit
will
never
again
be
a
domin
a
it
is
today
especi
if
amd
get
the
go
ahead
to
sell
it
s
thi
week
a
it
appear
it
might
the
competit
from
all
front
is
gear
up
for
an
awesom
battl
appl
user
should
be
excit
that
powerpc
while
not
guarante
domin
is
a
guarante
winner
even
if
it
one
of
sever
mark
