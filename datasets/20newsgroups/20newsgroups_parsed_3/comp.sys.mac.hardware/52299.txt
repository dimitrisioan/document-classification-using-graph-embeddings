simm
on
s
in
the
last
two
week
i
have
the
follow
problem
on
two
s
ha
a
mb
simm
and
the
other
a
mb
simm
both
are
about
month
old
bought
from
differ
vendor
and
instal
by
differ
peopl
both
comput
begin
crash
frequent
lock
up
and
ultim
the
memori
chime
crash
would
almost
alway
occur
if
you
move
the
screen
and
sometim
would
occur
when
you
werent
even
touch
the
comput
in
both
case
take
the
machin
apart
take
the
memori
out
and
put
it
back
in
solv
the
problem
for
awhil
but
then
it
would
comeback
my
margin
educ
guess
a
to
what
happen
is
that
larger
simm
are
lopsid
in
that
the
insert
point
is
sort
of
a
pivot
point
and
after
time
they
begin
to
move
about
possibl
becaus
of
pressur
on
the
keyboard
or
someth
anyway
ha
anyon
el
had
such
a
problem
or
solut
if
somehow
you
could
support
the
other
end
of
the
simm
to
prevent
it
from
move
ive
had
no
problem
for
the
past
week
by
