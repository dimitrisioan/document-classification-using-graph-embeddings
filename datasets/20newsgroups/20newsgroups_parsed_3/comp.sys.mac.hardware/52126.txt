from
jerri
stubb
ye
i
know
comput
and
harddisk
drive
should
be
alway
on
but
what
about
monitor
they
gener
a
lot
of
heat
should
i
or
shouldnt
i
keep
them
on
hour
a
day
ani
advic
thank
take
carepaul
i
vote
for
turn
them
off
at
night
the
stress
of
offon
is
a
littl
harm
so
dont
turn
it
off
then
back
on
an
hour
later
etc
but
turn
them
off
for
hour
or
overnight
is
a
good
idea
the
electrici
consumpt
will
go
down
if
you
turn
them
off
overnight
along
with
heat
we
have
a
lot
of
year
old
machin
in
the
basement
that
still
work
but
who
care
they
are
off
hour
a
day
