im
go
to
buy
a
daystar
with

for
the
se
sinc
there
were
so
mani

about
problem
with
thi

my
question
doe
the
board
work
with
and
aux
doe
anybodi
know
problem
with
ani
kind
of
softwar
well
i
havent
seen
ani
report
of
problem
with
the
turbo
but
to
my
knowledg
daystar
ha
not
releas
a
version
of
the
board
that
work
with
anyth
but
the
iisi
and
iici
and
they
have
not
finish
tweakingtest
for
use
with
aux
thi
may
not
happen
until
the
aux
upgrad
is
releas
my
guess
so
id
recommend
wait
or
buy
the
mhz
board
and
upgrad
later
when
aux
compat
is
assur
turbo
interfac
card
for
the
ii
iix
se
iicx
etc
will
probabl
be
avail
sooner
but
if
aux
compat
is
a
requir
it
is
probabl
best
to
be
patient
and
let
someon
el
be

pioneer
an
ad
advant
of
wait
for
the
daystar
