can
not
move
data
fast
enough
i
want
to
achiev
an
overal
throughput
rate
of
around
megabyt
sec
for
veri
larg
data
transfer
around
mb
i
have
a
quadra
i
have
a
nubu
network
card
that
can
pump
data
in
to
mac
memori
at
mb
use
blockmod
transfer
i
have
a
highspe
disk
array
no
asynchron
pb
call
that
can
achiev
mb
let
say
all
transfer
go
from
disk
to
buffer
to
network
card
it
is
not
enough
to
first
transfer
all
the
data
from
the
disk
to
buffer
then
transfer
all
the
data
from
the
buffer
to
card
mb
then
mb
result
in
an
overal
mb
too
slow
so
i
tri
the
follow
scheme
for
an
nmegabyt
transfer
step
load
the
st
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
asynch
send
st
mb
out
card
load
the
nd
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
asynch
send
nd
mb
out
card
load
the
rd
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
n
asynch
send
the
n
mb
out
card
load
the
nth
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
n
send
the
nth
mb
out
card
even
though
the
code
appar
doe
execut
the
card
transfer
asynchron
and
the
card
doe
not
use
the
mac
cpu
at
all
it
is
use
the
buffer
tho
each
of
the
step
through
n
take
a
long
a
if
the
two
transfer
were
execut
one
after
anoth
so
there
is
no
improv
in
the
rate
whi
is
the
mac
ram
dualport
so
the
nubu
card
and
the
disk
driver
can
both
access
data
at
the
same
time
is
the
problem
that
the
two
devic
card
and
disk
driver
both
have
to
use
the
same
bu
to
mac
ram
is
there
anyth
i
can

i
get

of
all
the

i
dont
want
