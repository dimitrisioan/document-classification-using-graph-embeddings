andrew
gewek
write
i
can
not
speak
for
dale
but
i
am
quit
sure
that
the
macintosh
us
the
full
bit
or
bit
data
path
to
it
full
advantag
that
is
it
is
run
a
fast
with
two
or
four
pin
simm
a
it
would
with
one
pin
simm
now
it
may
be
that
longword
access
assum
a
bit
data
path
here
get
the
first
byte
from
the
first
simm
the
second
byte
from
the
second
and
so
on
thi
would
mean
that
each
longword
of
memori
is
actual
split
among
four
simm
one
for
each
byte
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
that
the
simm
are
interleav
by
word
or
longword
not
just
by
byte
or
they
could
be
success
in
memori
and
the
memori
control
deal
with
the
eightbit
data
path
that
each
one
ha
i
suspect
though
that
they
are
interleav
to
some
extent
so
that
bit
can
be
read
or
written
at
onc
thi
would
indic
a
bytelevel
interleav
i
am
not
confus
thi
with
the
new
machin
longword
interleav
with
two
pin
simm
of
the
same
sort
although
that
seem
to
be
the
same
sort
of
idea
there
you
get
an
essenti
bit
data
path
ro
excus
me
to
ram
instead
of
just
a
bit
one
ye
the
cpu
cant
handl
it
but
when
write
to
success
address
it
speed
someth
up
so
dale
am
i
right
pin
simm
are
interleav
by
byte
allow
the
full
data
bu
or
a
is
common
with
usenet
and
me
in
particular
am
i
a
clueless
a
everyon
els
what
conclus
can
be
drawn
from
thi
im
tri

figur
out
what
kind
of

configur
for
