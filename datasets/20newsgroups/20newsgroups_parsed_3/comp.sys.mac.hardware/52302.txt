i

at
long

ke
i
am
look
at
a

and
a
use
iici
price
have
yet
to
be
work
out
so
im
just
think
right
now
about
their
merit
and
drawback
here
what
ive
thought
of
the
iici
ha
much
greater
potenti
for
expans
a
la
nubu
and
greater
memori
capac
the
lc
iii
would
be
new
under
warranti
newer
rom
is
the
iici
bit
clean
and
would
have
sound
input
i
also
like
the
pizzabox
case
performancewis
i
have
read
that
they
are
almost
ident
the
lc
iii
be
a
littl
slower
so
which
should
i
get
erik
ye
the

ha
bit
clean
rom
either
model
would
be
a
good
choic
anoth
option
get
a
new
iici
from
a
dealer
that
hasnt
sold
out
yet
also
dont
forget
the
performa
which
i
believ
is
the

may
be
packag
with
more
goodi
for
a
better
price
