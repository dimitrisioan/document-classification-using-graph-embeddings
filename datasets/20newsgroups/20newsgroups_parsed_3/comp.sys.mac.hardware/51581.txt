i

the

cheaper
at

in

than

joseph

write
the
decstat
model
and
come
with
thinwir
onli
cant
say
for
certain
about
the

and
so
your
best
bet
that
not
true
onli
the

come
with
a

the
and
all
have

onli
i
distinctli
rememb
thi
becaus
when
got
the
first

i
thought
all
of

are
go
to
be
thinwir
i
eventu
had
to
go
back
and
order
desta
dec
over
version
of
an
auitobnc
adapt
that
must
be
use
with
a
transciev
cabl
for
the
rest
of
the
station
my
advis
to
the
veri
origin
poster
beverli
is
if
all
you
want
is
to
creat
a
lan
with
two
workstat
and
wont
add
machin
to
it
ever
go
for
thinwir
regardless
of
the
medium
type
go
for
utp
unshield
twist
pair
wire
requir
a
concentr
which
mean
extra
money
and
i
believ
these
unit
come
with
at
least
port
a
for
thicknet
it
a
nightmar
and
cabl
is
expens
avoid
it
unless
you
have
no
choic
eg
the
two
machin
are
two
floor
part
on
the
mac
side
you
will
need
one
thinwir
medium
adapt
from
appl
or
thirdparti
macx
make
sure
you
get
version
wont
run
on
system
mactcp
which
come
with
macx
if
you
get
macx
v
you
should
be
get
mactcp
v
with
it
dont
use
earlier
version
on
a
centri
you
may
or
may
not
need
a
ohm
termin
depend
on
the
thinwir
medium
adapt
so
just
ask
the
sale
if
the
adapt
is
selftermin
or
not
configur
mactcp
to
use
ethernet
on
the
decstat

you
will
need
for
a
model
you
will
onli
need
a

for

you
will
need
an

get
one
that
can
