g
wright
write
anyway
i
wa
hope
someon
knowledg
about
mac
intern
could
set
me
straight
is
it
simpli
imposs
for
a
mac
se
to
print
grayscal
or
could
to
use
the
grayscal
featur
i
believ
you
need
a
mac
equip
with
colour
quickdraw
i
wa
told
thi
somewher
or
other
but
it
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
mac
se
can
print
grayscal
imag
load
with
the
proper
softwar
howev
the
mac
se
can
not
display
grayscal
on
the
origin
poster
w
g
wright
post
an
item
say
that
he
had
bought
a
new
wizzbang
laser
printer
from
appl
a
select
i
think
which
can
print
grayscal
he
then
said
that
he
can
not
print
grayscal
from
hi
se
comput
and
also
that
all
the
expert
he
ha
dealt
with
agre
that
it
is
not
possibl
thi
is
the
one
major
bugbear
about
do
a
rd
parti
se
upgrad
compar
to
appl
se
to
se
upgrad
you
will
never
be
abl
to
run
color
quickdraw
it
is
color
quickdraw
that
control
color
and
grayscal
se
can
print
some
colour
thi
is
becaus
quickdraw
the
origin
noncolour
version
ha
the
right
hook
for
eight
colour
some
of
you
will
rememb
the
scsigraph
solut
to
get
a
colour
screen
for
your
se
i
think
that
it
gave
you
sixteen
colour
by
dither
or
someth
there
is
no
reason
that
appl
couldnt
releas
softwar
patch
for
older
comput
there
are
lot
of
mac
pluse
classic
and
se
that
have
been
upgrad
to
and
processor
which
should
be
perfectli
abl
to
deal
with
color
quickdraw
but
they
wont
and
rd
parti
are
have
a
difficult
time
in
duplic
the
mac
rom
ie
nutek
et
al
just
one
caveat
i
would
have
thought
that
if
you
were
print
a
postscript
grayscal
imag
onto
a
postscript
grayscal
printer
that
you
would
be
abl
to
do
so
whatev
mac
you
were
use
and
i
am
pretti
sure
that
the
select
is
not
a
postscript
printer
correct
me
if
im
wrong
