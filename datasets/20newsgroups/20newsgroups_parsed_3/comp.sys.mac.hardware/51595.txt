a
mac
iicx
with
the
origin
intern
quantum
mb
hard
disk
and
an
unus
floppi
drive
we
also
have
a
new
spare
connor
mb
disk
which
we
would
like
to
use
the
idea
is
to
replac
the
broken
floppi

with
the
new
hard
disk
but
there
seem
to
be
some
problem

the
cx
ha
onli
connector
for
one
singl
hard
disk
drive
if
i
made
a
ribbon
cabl
and
a
power
cabl
with
three
connector
each
for
motherboard
for
each
of
the
disk
would
it
work
is
the
iicx
abl
to
suppli
the
extra
power
to
the
extra
disk
what
about
termin
i
suppos
that
i
should
remov
the
resistor
pack
from
the
disk
that
is
closest
to
the
motherboard
but
leav
them
instal
in
the
other
disk
the
scsi
id
jumper
should
also
be
chang
so
that
the
new
disk
get
id

old
one
should
have
id
it
is
no
problem
for
u
to
remov
the
floppi
drive
a
we
have
an
extern
floppi
that
we
can
use
if
