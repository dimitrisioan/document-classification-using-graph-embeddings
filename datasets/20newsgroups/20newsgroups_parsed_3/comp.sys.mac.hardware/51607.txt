re
ok
to
set
lb
on
top
of
centri
i
had
the
same
question
for
my
lb
nec
fg
monitor
the
appl
guy
said
that
their
lb
monitor
is
ok
to
put
ontop
of
the
centri
and
had
no
coment
beyond
that
i
wa
go
to
just
put
the
nec
on
the
box
but
then
i
got
to
think
the
monitor
ha
a
small
tiltswivel
base
so
mayb
the
weight
would
be
more
concentr
than
with
appl
i
dont
know
the
area
of
the
base
of
their
tiltswivel
addit
the
cdrom
drive
is
in
the
middl
so
i
cut
a
piec
of
thick
wood
to
about
x
cover
it
in
a
cream
cover
cloth
and
use
it
a
a
buffer
layer
between
the
centriss
top
and
the
monitor
