re
centri
to
mhz
or
mhz
saiid
paryavi
write
i
just
put
a
mhz
cpu
into
my
centri
now
i
have
a
math
coprocessor
but
is
it
possibl
to
speed
up
the
centri
to
run
at
either
mhz
or
mhz
not
without
replac
most
of
the
chip
on
the
motherboard
the
c
isnt
like
the
iisi
wa
mean
that
the
motherboard
of
the
c
is
actual
design
to
run
at
the
speed
of
the
cpu
and
not
design
to
run
at
a
higher
speed
like
mhz
but
be
forc
to
run
at
the
speed
of
a
slower
cpu
mhz
i
didnt
see
ani
oscil
on
the
motherboard
like
the
one
on
the
iisi
motherboard
where
is
the
oscil
for
the
centri
there
is
more
than
one
oscil
if
you
are
talk
about
the
cpu
oscil
chip
i
think
that
it
is
locat
under
the
socket
for
the
at
least
thi
is
what
i
have
read
in
some
other
post
in
thi
