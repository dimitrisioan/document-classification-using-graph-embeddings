write
a
i
said
i
know
a
multisess
cdrom
is
necessari
if
you
do
more
photo
but
what
if
it
is
just
a
writabl
cdrom
drive
and
do
a
second
session
do
you
need
one
for
that
too
if
you
write
a
second
time
to
a
cd
you
need
to
have
multisess
capabl
to
read
the
second
session
whether
it
is
photo
or
just
data
or
whatev
here
is
a
simplifi
way
of
look
at
it
the
first
session
ha
the
directori
structur
burn
at
some
track
the
second
session
ha
a
newer
directori
structur
but
the
first
directori
still
exist
becaus
you
can
not
chang
onli
add
so
if
you
put
that
in
a
normal
drive
and
it
will
onli
look
to
the
first
directori
and
think
it
ha
found
all
data
multisess
kindof
mean
that
the
drive
will
look
for
the
last
directori
written
to
the
disc
older
system
look
onli
for
the
directori
not
take
multipl
directori
into
account
