re
what
do
yall
think
of
the
iivx
in
articl
peter
bell
write
my
advisor
ha
decid
to
get
a
mac
for
the
lab
now
that
we
are
fund
again
the
consensu
in
the
lab
wa
that
all
we
realli
need
wa
an
lciii
but
he
decid
he
want
a
centri
the
lack
of
an
fpu
on
that
machin
and
the
price
struck
me
a
make
it
worth
le
than
an
lciii
so
i
have
suggest
we
get
a
iivx
instead
it
seem
heavili
expand
and
for
what
do
peopl
with
iivx
think
of
them
they
seem
like
good
machin
to
me
and
i
like
the
nubu
slot
in
case
we
ultim
decid
we
want
to
do
work
with
video
on
it
the
iivxlciii
perform
at
a
centri
price
the
onli
reason
to
get
an
iivx
is
if
you
realli
need
the
fullsiz
nubu
slot
keep
in
mind
that
the
support
all
appl
monitor
and
ha
option
ethernet
thi
lessen
but
doesnt
elimin
the
need
for
nubu
card
and
unless
your
run
fpuintens
softwar
the
will
blow
the
door
off
the
lciii
and
the
iivx
the
lciii
on
the
other
hand
is
suffici
for
most
peopl
and
ha
a
great
price
if
you
havent
guess
i
find
halv
the
bu
clock
the
iivx
mhz
up
v
mhz
bu
a
throughli
bad
thing
and
i
hope
appl
never
doe
it
again
