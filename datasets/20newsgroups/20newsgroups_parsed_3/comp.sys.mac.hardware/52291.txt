re
centri
flaki
ive
been
play
with
a
centri
for
the
last
coupl
week
the
onli
problem
that
i
have
seen
is
that
a
coupl
of
the
applic
i
run
are
incompat
with
the
s
processor
cach
so
i
have
to
run
with
it
turn
off
actual
the
main
thing
i
dont
like
it
is
that
it
doesnt
have
a
softwar
poweruppowerdown
and
the
power
switch
is
directli
under
the
floppi
drive
i
havent
hit
it
think
it
would
eject
the
disk
but
some
tire
night
im
go
to
be
realli
upset
with
that
design
decis
in
all
no
problem
with
it
floppi
and
print
have
been
just
fine
print
is
done
across
a
localtalk
net
not
a
directli
connect
printer
bill
