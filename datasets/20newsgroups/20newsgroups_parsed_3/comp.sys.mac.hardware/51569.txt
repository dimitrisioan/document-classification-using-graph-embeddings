i
said
i
know
that
plug
and
unplug
adb
devic
with
the
power
on
is
not
support
and
you
can
hit
problem
if
you
have
multipl
devic
with
clash
address
and
all
that
ive
had
a
coupl
of
email
respons
from
peopl
who
seem
to
believ
that
thi
sort
of
thing
is
not
onli
unsupport
it
is
downright
danger
i
have
heard
of
no
such
warn
from
anybodi
at
appl
just
to
be
sure
i
ask
a
coupl
of
our
technician
one
of
whom
ha
been
servic
mac
for
year
there
is
no
danger
of
damag
logic
board
by
plug
and
unplug
adb
devic
with
the
power
on
noooooooo
ive
been
servic
mac
for
year
too
and
ive
had
to
repair
a
number
of
motherboard
that
had
been
damag
thi
way
it
rare
but
it
doe
happen
mind
you
thi
doesnt
mean
you
shouldnt
do
it
the
part
that
can
blow
the
adb
power
fuse
and
rf
filter
arent
too
expens
so
if
you
have
a
someon
around
who
can
do
componentlevel
repair
it
may
be
worth
the
risk
especi
if

might
get
to
pay
me
to
fix
it
on
the
other
hand
if

repair
option
is
the
