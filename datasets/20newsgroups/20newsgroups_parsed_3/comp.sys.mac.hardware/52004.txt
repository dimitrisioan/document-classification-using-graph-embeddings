how
can
i
get

by

the
easiest

is
to
ask
a

be
to
copi

for
you
if
your
at

there
absolut
no

chanc
are

good
that
someon

onc
you

if

for

turn
you
into

jelli
you
can

download

if
you
have

gotten
by

other
than

then
i
suppos
ill
mention
that
you
can
in
fact
ftp
a
work
copi

though
thi
is
by
far
the
hardest
way
to
get
it
ftp
to

and
login
type
the

binari
hit
return
type
cd

then
get

it
alway
possibl
that
by
the
time
you
read
thi

chang
so
if
thi
fail
look

if

you
should
now
have
