mathematica
speed
test
well
here
are
the
result
of
the
mathematica
test
which
i
post
to
thi
newsgroup
the
test
wa
the
follow
command
plotdxi

xyplotpoint
i
wa
just
curiou
how
fast
the
plot
command
would
be
execut
on
variou
macintosh
machin
a
well
a
other
person
comput
and
workstat
the

lot
slower
in
fact
perhap
the
version
of
mathematica
make
a
differ
or
the
fact
that
not
much
ram
wa
alloc
anoth
interest
thing
is
how
fast
the
sgi
did
it
wow
basic
though
i
wouldnt
draw
ani
conclus
from
thi
data
it
seem
that
mathematica
speed
is
depend
on
a
lot
of
variabl
i
wa
just
curiou
how
differ
machin
would
measur
up
well
if
you
have
ani
question

if
i
