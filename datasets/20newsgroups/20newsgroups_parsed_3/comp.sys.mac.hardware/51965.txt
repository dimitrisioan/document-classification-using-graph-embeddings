compar
i
guess
the
real
question
is
who
ask
the
origin
question
and
whi
wa
it
so
broad
are
we
talk
pure
process
power
what
kind
of
process
btw
isol
from
everi
other
factor
and
influenc
in
the
system
or
are
we
shop
for
a
home
comput
base
on
the
cpu
spec
yuck
i
just
finish
a
project
that
involv
realtim
process
of
serial
data
and
discov
that
the
program
interfac
assembl
ha
a
lot
to
do
with
the
power
of
a
cpu
in
a
particular
applic
if
what
you
want
to
do
is
easi
to
code
with
the
instruct
set
given
then
not
onli
is
it
easi
but
it
cheap
and
quick
if
you
have
to
fake

without
a

instruct
then
your
cycl
count
go
through
the

well
let
not
start
a
flame
war
about
whose
comput
is
better
than
whose
the
orgin
question
wa
about
classifi
microprocessor
have
reread
the
entir
thread
i
dont
think
much
more
can
be
said
without
get
down
into
