alverson
write
i
believ
appl
ha
a
patent
on
the
region
featur
of
quickdraw
a
mac
clone
would
have
to
implement
region
thi
is
whi
appl
comment
wa
that
they
believ
it
is
not
possibl
to
make
a
mac
clone
without
infring
on
their
patent
they
may
have
other
patent
like
thi
appl
ha
patent
their
implement
of
region
which
presum
includ
the
intern
data
structur
which
ha
never
been
offici
document
by
appl
appl
can
not
patent
the
concept
of
a
region
im
guess
that
either
nutek
reverseengin
appl
intern
data
structur
for
region
i
dunno
if
thi
would
hold
up
in
court
or
they
came
up
with
their
own
data
structur
if
it
the
latter
then
they
wont
be
abl
to
draw
pict
file
contain
region
besid
pict
file
there
arent
mani
place
where
region
are
store
on
disk
quicktim
movi
perhap
a
long
a
the
region
isnt
be
store
on
disk
and
transfer
from
a
mac
to
a
nutek
clone
or
vice
versa
it
doesnt
matter
if
nutek
us
a
complet
differ
intern
data
structur
i
rememb
read
that
appl
also
ha
a
patent
on
their
adb
hardwar
and
that
the
nutek
clone
would
therefor
be
lack
an
adb
port
what
other
patent
doe
appl
have
on
the
mac
joe
schwartz
email
or
mapinfo
corp
broadway
these
are
my
own
opinion
ani
similar
to
the
troy
ny
opinion
of
mapinfo
corpor
is
pure
coincident
