is
pretti
ok
sinc
it
fast
sound
manag
use
by
the
book
is
useless
dispos
of

channel
a
soon
a
sound
ha
complet
is
out
of
the
question
for
game
with
smooth
anim
it
too
slow
whi
would
you
dispos
a
channel
if
you
are
go
to
play
more
sound
soon
if
you
are
tri
to
write
a
game
you
shouldnt
be
use
sndplay
instead
make
a
channel
and
use
buffercmd
to
play
sound
on
it
it
work
great
you
can
add
callback
to
the
channel
also
to
let
you
know
when
the
channel
is
get
empti
befor
it
get
empti
the
sound
driver
is
so
much
snappier
than
sound
manag
unfortun
system
support
it
poorli
make
program
crash
occasion
the
moral
of
the
stori
is
to
develop
dont
cheat
well
i
want
my
code
to
work
on
old
system
too
i
dont
know
about
sy
but
at
least
on
there
are
bug
in
the
sound
manag
that
caus
channel
to
hang
with
no
error
messag
thi
happend
when
i
keep
a
channel
open
for
long
period
necessari
for
perform
and
play
mani
sound
stop
sound
halfway
callback
seem
not
to
be
reliabl
then
onli
way
i
can
safe
tell
if
a
sound
ha
stop
play
is
to
inspect
privat
variabl
in
the
channel
qhead
i
think
it
wa
and
the
onli
way
i
have
found
to
tell
if
a
channel
is
hung
is
to
inspect
an
undocu
flag
and
modifi
it
callback
are
veri
reliabl
i
found
them
reliabl
even
under
system
i
wa
do
continu
background
sound
with
interrupt
sound
effect
on
system
with
the
imv
document
you
probabl
were
cancel
your
callback
command
out
of
your
channel
of
cours
you
didnt
get
call
in
gener
if
you
have
problem
with
sound
work
when
you
play
one
per
channel
and
then
close
the
channel
with
the
relat
slowdown
but
then
when
you
play
more
than
one
you
dont
work
then
you
are
ad
more
than
one
synthes
to
a
channel
possibl
the
same
one
multipl
time
thi
might
be
becaus
you
are
call
sndplay
on
a
preexist
channel
with
a
sound
resourc
which
add
the
sampl
sound
synthes
to
the
channel
first
thing
befor
it
play
most
sampl
sound
have
thi
command
at
the
start
of
them
you
need
to
resedit
the
sound
and
remov
that
command
then
when
you
creat
your
channel
specifi
the
sampl
sound
synthes
to
be
the
channel
synth
then
you
can
use
asynch
sndplay
all
you
want
youll
probabl
want
to
switch
to
buffercmd
sinc
you
are
go
to
have
to
use
snddocommand
anyway
to
add
callback
now
befor
you
go
ahead
and
tell
me
i
am
full
of
it
and
the
sound
manag
doesnt
work
for
game
rememb
spectr
use
it
and
it
work
great
if
spectr
can
spare
the
cpu
time
you
can
too
one
littl
disclaim
there
are
some
out
there
who
say
the
sound
manag
in
the
iisi
cant
be
made
to
work
right
im
not
sure
either
way
but
i
know
for
sure
that
you
can
make
your
sound
work
correctli
on
everi
other
machin
