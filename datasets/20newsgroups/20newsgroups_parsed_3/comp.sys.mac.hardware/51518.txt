other
than
the
pb
not
go
i
ask
onli
two
thing
i
can
think
of
although
nicad
c
batteri
should
be
complet
discharg
about
onc
a
month
leadacid
batteri
shouldnt
ever
be
complet
discharg
well
mayb
onc
in
a
while
is
okay
thi
is
a
veri
common
misconcept
deal
with
nicad
batteri
it
is
a
good
idea
to
complet
discharg
a
nicad
cell
period
it
is
not
a
good
idea
to
complet
discharg
a
nicad
batteri
the
differ
be
that
a
cell
is
onli
one
cell
nicad
put
out
volt
like
a
recharg
aaa
aa
c
or
d
a
batteri
is
defin
a
more
than
one
cell
volt
or
for
nicad
equival
due
to
differ
in
the
individu
cell
of
a
batteri
complet
discharg
can
actual
harm
a
nicad
batteri
more
than
help
it
overcom
the
memori
effect
the
most
common
problem
is
that
over
time
an
individu
cell
can
develop
intern
short
which
will
weaken
other
cell
that
are
connect
to
it
thu
reduc
the
lifespan
of
your
batteri
pack
etc
okay
naiv
question
how
doe
one
discharg
a
cell
without
discharg
the
entir
batteri
