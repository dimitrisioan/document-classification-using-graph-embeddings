write
the
electrici
consumpt
will
go
down
if
you
turn
them
off
overnight
along
with
heat
i
wonder
how
hard
it
would
be
ie
what
it
would
add
to
the
cost
to
design
desktop
machin
with
a
power
saver
featur
built
in
which
would
reduc
power
consumpt
automat
if
the
machin
is
idl
for
more
than
some
amount
of
time
thi
is
pretti
standard
in
portabl
machin
and
the
same
kind
of
trick
could
be
play
spin
down
disk
turn
off
screen
reduc
clock
speed
etc
the
advantag
of
thi
over
just
turn
the
thing
off
would
be
you
dont
have
to
rememb
to
do
anyth
and
the
machin
is
still
avail
over
the
network
the
tricki
part
might
be
in
defin
