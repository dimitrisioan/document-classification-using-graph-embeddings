is
the
stori
i
have
a
network
with
mac
on
localtalk
one
of
them
ha
an
ethernet
card
and
is
current
connect
to
a
next
dont
laugh
i
got
it
for
the
price
of
a
mac
iisi
the
next
is
connect
to
the
internet
over
slip
run
on
a
baud
modem
current
we
can
telnet
from
the
mac
w
ethernet
to
the
next
and
then
telnet
out
again
to
the
rest
of
the
world
what
we
want
to
know
is
if
there
is
some
sort
of
hardwar
that
will
rout
telnet
session
from
the
localtalk
mac
to
the
next
via
the
ethernet
mac
from
what
we
have
heard
air
doesnt
do
the
trick
softwar
solut
would
be
good
too
but
my
impress
is
that
there
arent
go
to
be
ani
our
immedi
interest
is
to
be
abl
to
get
to
the
next
and
telnet
out
again
the
slip
connect
doesnt
allow
u
to
assign
ip
number
to
machin
so
everyon
share
that
numberoh
well
what
you
need
is
a
hardwar
router
such
a
etherroutetcp
made
by
compat
system
thi
will
allow
you
to
connect
your
localtalk
network
mac
to
your
ethernet
network
next
and
ethernet
mac
it
will
rout
tcpip
protocol
between
the
two
network
softwar
router
are
also
avail
for
le
money
but
im
not
sure
if
they
work
with
tcpip
