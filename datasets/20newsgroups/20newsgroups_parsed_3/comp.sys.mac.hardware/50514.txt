write
i
am
go
to
be
get
a
c
soon
but
i
dont
want
appl
to
come
out
with
the
cyclon
and
the
tempest
in
a
month
and
have
the
price
drop
on
the
system
i
want
i
have
negoti
a
good
deal
with
a
supplier
for
a
c
and
i
would
like
to
jump
on
it
but
again
i
dont
want
the
price
drop
to
smuther
me
btw
the
deal
i
have
is
a
c
with
mous
for
doe
anyon
know
of
a
better
deal
i
dont
know
how
to
say
it
best
but
you
are
gaurente
that
the
price
of
the
c
is
go
to
drop
thi
year
thi
week
macweek
report
that
appl
is
probabl
plan
a
drop
in
august
my
guess
is
that
it
may
come
sooner
if
appl
decid
to
chang
the
price
structur
upon
releas
of
the
multimedia
unit
thi
summer
your
price
look
pretti
good
at
about
more
then
i
pay
for
mine
last
month
i
would
have
rather
wait
for
one
of
the
new
machin
thi
sommer
like
the
cyclon
but
the
resal
valu
of
my
iici
would
have
not
been
squat
by
then
thu
financ
forc
me
to
purchas
now
im
happi
with
the
machin
and
wont
feel
betray
at
all
when
appl
cut
the
price
to
le
then
next
week
heh
bottom
line
if
the
c
doe
what
you
want
buy
it
if
you
wait
until
the
cylcon
come
out
for
a
price
break
then
you
might
a
well
wait
for
the
powerpc
to
come
out
for
anoth
price
break
and
then
the
unit
which
follow
them
you
may
save
some
money
but
youv
lost
a
lot
of
time
when
you
could
have
been
use
the
comput
face
it
appl
price
are
go
to
be
in
a
continu
state
of
flux
at
least
they
arent
go
to
tri
rais
them
again
