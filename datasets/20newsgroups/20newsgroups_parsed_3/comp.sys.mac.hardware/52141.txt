re
monitor
should
they
be
kept
on
hour
a
day
i
wonder
how
hard
it
would
be
ie
what
it
would
add
to
the
cost
to
design
desktop
machin
with
a
power
saver
featur
built
in
which
would
reduc
power
consumpt
automat
if
the
machin
is
idl
for
more
than
some
amount
of
time
i
believ
that
appl
sun
and
a
number
of
other
desktop
machin
manufactur
have
agre
with
the
govern
to
incorpor
powersav
techniqu
thi
is
also
someth
that
govern
in
other
countri
are
like
to
requir
in
the
futur
so
expect
to
see
it
thi
may
includ
the
abil
for
the
system
to
fulli
power
down
the
monitor
via
a
control
power
outlet
and
power
it
back
on
automat
is
thi
a
sell
on
screen
saver
softwar
compani
goal
for
idl
power
consumpt
have
been
set
at
someth
like
watt
for
the
system
not
includ
the
monitor
dont
quot
me
on
thi
note
that
in
mani
busi
the
save
will
be
substanti
especi
if
you
factor
in
reduc
load
on
air
condit
system
sun
did
a
studi
that
indic
that
simpli
power
off
monitor
for
the
night
would
save
the
compani
sun
itself
on
the
order
of
m
per
year
put
other
and
automat
powersav
featur
in
would
probabl
have
greater
than
doubl
that
valu
given
that
we
are
see
more
and
more
reason
to
leav
our
work
and
home
comput
on
get
fax
automat
get
email
build
power
consumpt
control
into
all
machin
ha
a
potenti
to
cut
off
the
nation
power
consumpt
base
on
data
i
heard
btw
when
encourag
employe
to
power
off
monitor
when
leav
work
it
wa
point
out
that
thi
should
onli
be
done
with
monitor
with
the
power
switch
on
front
there
wa
some
indic
that
monitor
with
power
switch
on
the
rear
are
not
design
to
toler
lot
of
power
cycl
thi
may
onli
appli
to
the
monitor
we
use
but
might
be
worth
check
if
you
happen
to
have
a
monitor
with
the
switch
in
back
