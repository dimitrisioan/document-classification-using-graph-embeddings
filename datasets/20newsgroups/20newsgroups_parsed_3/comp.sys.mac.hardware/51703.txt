a
tape
backup
in
my
c
lot
of
the
issu
are
the
same
so
to
answer
your
question
in
articl

my
pli
m
syquest
drive
ha
a
wire
from
the

an
id
switch
on
the
outsid
of
the
case
where
do
i
connect
thi
switch
can
the
comput
just
tell
with
intern
drive
you
probabl
want
to
hardwir
the
scsi
id
with
short
jumper
put
it
at
a
conveni
number
like
you
could
cut
a
hole
in
the
back
of
the
machin
to
rout
the
id
switch
but
whi
go
through
the
hassl
you
probabl
wont
be
need

notic
that

i
seem
to
recal
it
lay
over
the
ram

that
caus
problem
yeah
when
i
first
instal

wa
a
littl
concern

it
no
problem
the
devic

fine
with
the
overhang
it
shouldnt
reach
back
beyond
