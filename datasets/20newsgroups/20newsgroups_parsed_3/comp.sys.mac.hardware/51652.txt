spec
on
the
quadra
and
opinion
on
the
q
upgrad
of
a
iici
v
an
acceler

so

no
respons
that
ive
notic
pleas
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
these
possibl
upgrad
path
cost
effici
proscon
etc
thank
complet
q
are
best
obtain
from
your
dealer
or
some
recent
copi
of
macworld
or
macus
my
foggi
memori
suggest
that
the
most
relev
comparison
factor
visavi
a
iici
are
a
follow
mhz
mhz
data
path
dont
recal
thi
for
sure
but
it
slower
than
q
style
machin
for
sure
ethertalk
card
onboard
audio
inout
mb
ram
on
motherboard
simm
slot
nubu
slot
more
flexibl
buildin
video
than
the
ci
us
vram
in
comparison
a
iici
with
an
acceler
wont
give
you
audio
or
ethernet
or
the
same
video
option
with
a
acceler
cpu
perform
can
be
compar
but
i
think
it
end
up
cost
more
greg

actual
an
acceler
such
a
the
daystar
mhz
is
cheaper
than
upgrad
to
a
q
mhz
the
acceler
cost
about
wherea
the
upgrad
cost
just
quot
from
my
dealer
howev
the
q
upgrad
give
you
veri
fast
built
in
video
that
support
monitor
up
to
with
bit
depth
and
up
to
at
bit
depth
with
addit
vram
it
also
ha
a
scsi
port
capabl
of
a
much
faster
throughput
than
the
ci
which
make
a
big
differ
if
you
have
a
fast
hard
drive
if
the
improv
video
and
scsi
featur
are
import
to
you
your
better
off

q
upgrad
otherwis
save
some
money
and
