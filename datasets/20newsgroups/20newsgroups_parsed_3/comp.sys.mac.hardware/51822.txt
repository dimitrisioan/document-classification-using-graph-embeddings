doe
anyon
know
whi
appl
ha
an
ambigu
messag
for
c
regard
fpu
in
all
mac
price
list
ive
seen
everi
c
ha
the
messag
fpu
option
i
know
from
what
weve
discuss
in
thi
newsgroup
that
all
c
have
the
fpu
built
in
except
the
configur
whi
would
they
be
so
unclear
about
thi
issu
in
their
price
list
i
think
thi
is
mostli
the
fault
of
the
peopl
who
write
up
the
literatur
and
price
list
be
confus
themselv
sinc
there
are
two
possibl
processor
configur
and
one
of
the
them
doesnt
have
an
fpu
it
doe
seem
to
be
an
option
even
though
it
realli
isnt
im
plan
to
buy
the
c
cd
pretti
soon
but
im
now
get
confus
with
whether
it
come
with
fpu
or
not
well
then
allow
me
to
end
your
confus
the
c
onli
come
with
an
lc
in
the
base
configur
if
you
are
not
get
thi
configur
then
you
are
get
an
fpu
whi
say
option
if
it
built
in
good
question
i
have
been
wonder
that
sinc
feb
th
if
you
get
the
centri
with
cd
configur
you
are
get
a
mac
with
a
rc
processor
that
ha
builtin
math
coprocessor
support
my
understand
is
that
the
option
fpu
refer
to
your
option
of
purchas
the
centri
without
fpu
or
one
of
the
other
configur
with
fpu
thi
is
possibl
but
an
option
is
someth
that
you
are
suppos
to
be
abl
to
request
when
you
want
it
what
appl
ha
done
is
given
the
buyer
a
choic
between
configur
and
not
an
option
appl
doe
not
offer
an
upgrad
from
the
nonfpu
system
to
becom
an
fpu
system
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
processor
on
the
nonfpu
system
a
lc
can
be
replac
with
a
rc
suppli
by
anoth
vendor
thi
is
not
unclear
at
all
in
fact
appl
ha
includ
in
the
rom
of
those
machin
with
lc
code
to
recogn
the
presenc
of
the
full
s
fpu
and
use
it
therebi
make
the
upgrad
a
easi
a
switch
chip
you
pop
the
lc
out
and
pop
in
a
full
appl
did
send
a
memo
out
at
one
point
sate
that
the
centri
which
onli
come
with
a
nonfpu
lc
processor
can
not
be
upgrad
to
support
an
fpu
the
pin
configur
of
the
two
chip
appar
do
not
match
so
you
can
not
swap
one
for
anoth
again
accord
to
appl
memo
they
did
i
think
i
would
doublecheck
thi
it
ha
been
state
countless
time
in
thi
newsgroup
by
two
of
the
centri
hardwar
design
that
the
lc
and
the
full
are
pin
compat
and
that
the
c
can
be
upgrad
to
a
full
hade
