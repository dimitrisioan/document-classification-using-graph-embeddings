onli
one
channel
of
stereo
when
they
could
just
use
mono
sound
so
the
mono
sound
would
at
least
come
out
of
both
speaker
like
spectr
etc
do
quadra
s
and
powerbook
s
have
the
same
rom
to
my
knowledg
so
mayb
thi
is
a
rom
problem
if
so
though
whi
wouldnt
system
patch
over
thi
problem
thank
for
ani
help
you
can
provid
in
articl
jon
wtte
write
mac
sound
hardwar
is
diver
some
mac
play
in
stereo
and
mix
the
output
the
se
for
instanc
while
other
play
in
stereo
but
onli
ha
the
left
channel
for
the
speaker
while
some
are
truli
mono
like
the
lc
develop
know
that
stuff
play
in
the
left
channel
is
guarante
to
be
heard
while
the
right
channel
isnt
some
send
data
to
both
some
onli
send
data
to
the
left
channel
the
first
is
preferr
of
cours
okay
i
guess
it
time
for
a
quick
explan
of
mac
sound
the
origin
document
for
the
sound
hardwar
im
document
how
to
make
sound
by
directli
access
hardwar
basic
you
jam
valu
into
all
the
even
byte
from
soundbas
to
soundbasex
thi
wa
becaus
of
how
the
mac
and
some
later
machin
gener
sound
wa
by
scan
thi
block
and
da
everi
even
byte
the
odd
byte
went
to
the
floppi
on
some
machin
when
the
mac
ii
and
appl
sound
chip
wa
invent
it
wa
design
to
gener
stereo
sound
it
wa
also
design
to
be
compat
with
we
had
onc
document
so
store
byte
at
the
even
valu
at
soundbas
meant
i
want
to
play
a
mono
sound
and
so
it
wa
emul
but
appl
had
sinc
retract
the
document
on
soundbas
and
decid
not
to
document
the
lowest
layer
of
sound
gener
so
appl
never
explain
where
to
stuff
byte
if
you
want
to
make
stereo
sound
enter
game
develop
the
sound
driver
and
current
sound
manag
are
inconveni
lame
for
make
game
furthermor
peopl
who
port
from
the
ibm
dont
want
to
learn
more
api
so
it
ha
becom
popular
for
game
writer
to
write
to
soundbas
to
make
sound
sinc
it
is
veri
easi
sinc
the
mac
ii
appl
ha
had
mani
differ
kind
of
sound
output
hardwar
and
the
onli
thing
they
have
in
common
are
that
write
to
soundbas
work
on
some
hardwar
mac
ii
iix
iicx
iici
at
least
write
to
soundbas
get
you
mono
sound
through
both
speaker
on
some
mac
quadra
at
least
write
to
soundbas
get
you
mono
sound
on
the
left
channel
onli
both
are
technic
correct
interpret
of
the
origin
specif
but
one
is
obvious
prefer
for
asthet
reason
if
develop
use
the
sound
manag
and
i
think
the
sound
driver
mono
sound
will
typic
come
out
through
both
channel
regardless
of
the
underli
hardwar
it
is
possibl
to
specifi
you
want
to
gener
left
channel
onli
but
no
one
doe
if
develop
write
to
sound
base
their
game
will
onli
come
out
the
left
on
some
game
the
other
problem
the
origin
mac
ii
onli
produc
left
channel
sound
on
the
intern
speaker
while
the
se
mix
both
isnt
realli
relat
it
is
due
to
the
post
gener
amplif
use
on
the
motherboard
of
the
differ
machin
it
onli
affect
true
stereo
sound
sound
which
are
actual
mono
will
play
on
the
intern
speaker
no
matter
what
machin
you
have
now
to
more
directli
address
the
question
the
game
you
list
lem
out
of
thi
world
awesom
game
btw
glider
oid
and
also
hellcat

mani
more
these
are
just
what
ive
test

alley
spectr
spaceward
ho
and
also

golf
civil
and
more
these
are
again
onli
from
person
experi
use

the
more
of
the
stori
