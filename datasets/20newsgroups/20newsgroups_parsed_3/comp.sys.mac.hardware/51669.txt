interest
rumor
i
heard
that
the
lciii
ha
a
built
in
slot
for
a
powerpc
chip
is
thi
true
i
heard
that
the

with
an
addit
set
of
connet
to

for
the
full
bit
data
path
that
the

ii
lack
that
it
i
guess
a
board
with
a
powerpc
chip
could
be
made
that
would
fit
in
the
pd
but
that
the
onli
place
so
will
it
be
possibl
to
have
a
nubu
or
pd
powerpc
upgrad
or
will
it
requir
a
logic
board
swap
it
would
be
interest
for
appl
to
come
out
with
a
nubu
powerpc
that
allow
use
of
the
cpu
x
like
rocketshar
