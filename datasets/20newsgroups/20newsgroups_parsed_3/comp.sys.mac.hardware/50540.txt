first
thi
is
not
an
april
joke
a
dealer
in
my
town
told
me
that
the
powerbook
dont
sell
a
they
use
to
sell
the
guy
told
me
that
appl
is
have
the
same
problem
it
ha
when
the
desktop
mac
wa
too
expens
the
powerbook
are
too
expens
in
comparison
to
what
you
can
get
on
the
do
side
what
do
you
think
of
thi
do
you
feel
the
same
thing
about
it
just
curiou
sound
about
right
if
there
is
high
demand
for
a
product
there
is
littl
incent
to
aggres
cut
price
onc
the
demand
fall
off
a
bit
then
is
the
time
to
start
get
aggress
with
price
wait
too
long
can
realli
hurt
your
busi
though
the
powerbook
have
sold
veri
well
up
to
now
if
they
are
slow
down
appl
need
to
come
out
with
some
lower
price
version
the
onli
reason
i
own
a
powerbook
is
that
i
could
spring
for
a
pb
the
rest
of
the
lineup
is
way
to
pricey
for
me
id
bet
theyll
be
come
out
