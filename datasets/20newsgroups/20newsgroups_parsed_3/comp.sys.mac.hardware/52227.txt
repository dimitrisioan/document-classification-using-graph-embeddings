btw
when
encourag

to
power
off
monitor
when
leav
work
it
wa
point
out
that
thi
should
onli
be
done
with
monitor
with
the
power
switch
on

there
wa
some
indic
that
monitor
with

switch
on
the
rear
are
not

to
toler
lot
of
power
cycl
thi
may
onli
appli
to
the
monitor
we
use
but
might
be
worth
check
if
you
happen
to
have
a
monitor
with
the
switch
in
back
im
not
an
expert
but
have
spent
much
too
much
of
my
life
look
for
the
power
switch
or
the
bright
control
or
the
degauss
etc
etc
etc
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
the
onli
reason

in

where

is
