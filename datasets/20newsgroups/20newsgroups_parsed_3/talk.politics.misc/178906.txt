write
well
the
obviou
point
to
make
is
would
straight
men
fuck
like
rabbit
if
the
oppertun
present
itself
i
reckon
ani
man
would
go
wildli
promiscu
if
present
with
a
huge
varieti
of
will
partner
if
true
and
if
gay
were
the
same
a
straight
except
for
sexual
prefer
i
would
imagin
that
gay
would
have
much
le
sex
than
straight
becaus
the
avail
pool
for
date
is
le
than
onetenth
what
it
is
for
straight
somebodi
correct
flame
me
plea
i
can
not
believ
i
am
post
in
thi
thread
but
what
the
hell
he
ask
for
it
i
had
sort
of
the
same
reaction
myself
when
i
wa
first
realiz
i
wa
bi
so
what
of
everyon
el
is
straight
id
never
end
up
with
a
guy
anyway
a
sever
peopl
on
socbi
point
out
to
me
thi
is
true
onli
if
you
find
partner
for
relationship
or
just
for
sex
in
primarili
straight
circl
nowaday
with
gay
cultur
quit
visibl
in
major
citi
and
such
you
can
easili
find
yourself
in
an
overwhelmingli
queer
social
circl
if
you
so
choos
about
half
my
friend
are
bi
and
that
just
from
hang
out
in
the
scienc
fiction
club
and
go
to
ucbu
onc
a
week
it
not
a
if
i
have
to
go
out
of
my
way
and
hang
out
in
bar
or
someth
so
the
avail
pool
for
date
can
be
the
same
size
unless
of
cours
your
tri
to
date
a
random
sampl
of
the
u
popul
a
for
promiscu
ive
trade
email
with
clayton
on
the
topic
and
he
still
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
admit
that
ye
gay
male
are
sometim
forc
to
resort
to
anonym
sex
becaus
theyr
closet
and
cant
afford
to
be
seen
in
a
perman
relationship
or
that
part
of
the
promiscu
is
becaus
of
the
messedup
gender
role
in
our
societi
and
when
male
are
date
male
and
theyv
all
been
train
to
be
the
aggressor
in
sex
there
go
to
be
more
sex
or
that
what
dysfunct
what
screw
up
is
societ
attitud
not
gay
sexual
and
that
what
encourag
deviant
behavior
in
gay
male
also
note
that
just
becaus
someon
had
sex
partner
doesnt
mean
theyr
promiscu
ye
it
sound
ridicul
but
it
quit
possibl
for
someon
to
go
through
a
heavili
closet
phase
in
which
they
have
lot
of
anonym
sex
with
stranger
and
then
come
out
start
form
real
relationship
and
be
monogam
or
nearli
so
alan
jaffray
email
talk
alway
welcom
bi
those
who
danc
are
thought
mad
by
those
who
hear
not
the
music
