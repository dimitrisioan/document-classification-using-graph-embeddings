thank
you
for
play
but
obvious

are
not

the
materi
a
it
is
present
accord
to
the
report
ive
got
in
my
hand
the
newsweek
articl
which
report
that
to
percent
of
the
popul
is
gay
use
the
criterion
of
no
heterosexu
contact
in
the
past
year
but
at
the
same
time
the
univers
of
denver
studi
point
out
quit
dramat
that
of
all
selfidentifi
gay
men
have
had
some
form
of
heterosexu
contact
in
the
past
year
i
think
the
big
mistak
in
that
studi
must
be
that
if
one
had
had
no
sexual
contact
of
ani
kind
in
the
previou
year
they
are
count
a
heterosexu
even
if
they
didnt
intend
it
that
way
that
