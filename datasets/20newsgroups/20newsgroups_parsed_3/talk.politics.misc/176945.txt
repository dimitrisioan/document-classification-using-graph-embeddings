q
mr
presid
what
do
you
think
of
jess
jackson
protest
today
the
presid
i
think
it
an
inform
protest
i
think
it
fine
the
owner
put
out
a
statement
few
day
ago
which
they
say
wa
the
first
step
in
you
know
effort
to
increas
minor
ownership
and
minor
increas
in
manag
i
think
we
should
im
encourag
by
don
baylor
appoint
out
in
colorado
and
i
think
it
time
to
make
a
move
on
that
front
so
i
think
it
a
legitim
issu
and
i
think
it
like
i
said
it
an
inform
picket
and
not
an
attempt
to
get
peopl
not
to
go
to
the
game
so
i
think
it
good
q
do
you
think
theyr
move
fast
enough
the
presid
well
i
think
that
it
wa
a
good
first
step
and
i
think
youll
see
some
movement
now
and
i
think
it
an
issu
that
deserv
some
attent
and
theyr
obvious
go
to
give
it
some
and
i
think
that
reverend
jackson
be
out
there
will
highlight
the
issu
so
i
think
it
fine
q
mr
presid
how
about
the
logjam
in
the
senat
on
the
econom
stimulu
plan
do
you
think
theyll
be
abl
to
break
that
and
get
clotur
the
presid
i
dont
know
were
work
at
it
i
mean
it
a
classic
there
wa
an
articl
in
the
paper
today
one
of
the
paper
i
saw
which
pretti
well
sum
it
up
they
said
you
know
thi
is
a
it
just
a
polit
power
play
in
the
senat
the
major
doe
not
rule
it
not
like
the
countri
it
not
like
the
it
not
like
the
hous
if
the
minor
choos
they
can
stop
major
rule
and
that
what
theyr
do
there
are
a
lot
of
republican
senat
who
have
told
peopl
that
they
might
vote
for
the
stimulu
program
but
there
enorm
partisan
polit
pressur
not
to
do
it
and
of
cours
what
it
mean
is
that
in
thi
time
when
no
new
job
are
be
creat
even
though
there
seem
to
be
an
econom
recoveri
it
mean
that
for
polit
purpos
theyr
will
to
deni
job
to
place
like
baltimor
and
dalla
and
houston
and
pittsburgh
and
philadelphia
and
portland
and
seattl
it
veri
sad
i
mean
the
block
grant
program
wa
design
to
creat
job
in
a
hurri
base
on
local
prioriti
and
it
one
that
the
republican
had
alway
champion
just
about
the
onli
democrat
champion
of
the
program
were
peopl
like
me
who
were
out
there
at
the
grassroot
level
governor
and
senat
i
just
think
it
real
sad
that
they
have
chosen
to
exert
the
minor
muscl
in
a
way
that
will
keep
american
out
of
work
i
think
it
a
mistak
the
press
thank
you
