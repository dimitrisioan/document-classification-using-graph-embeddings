so
what
can
we
deduc
from
these
figur
are
there
a
lot
le
male
homosexu
than
there
use
to
be
or
are
men
perhap
woman
too
not
a
honest
a
they
use
to
be
about
there
sexual
presum
the
peopl
that
were
poll
in
you
mean
in
the
s
men
and
woman
were
much
more
open
about
their
homosexu
than
today
want
to
tri
that
one
again
that
probabl
is
not
true
but
today
it
may
not
be
much
better
for
the
gay
popul
in
gener
you
mean
ignor
studi
after
studi
so
that
we
can
continu
to
accept
a
studi
kinsey
that
is
obvious
wrong
where
are
all
of
these
studi
you
have
cite
a
few
and
my
research
show
that
there
are
not
that
mani
do
not
confus
a
survey
a
a
studi
there
is
a
big
differ
ask
peopl
outsid
of
a
poll
booth
and
ad
up
number
is
not
a
studi
a
easili
of
been
gay
i
suppos
one
of
the
big
debat
about
homosexu
is
whether
or
not
it
a
type
of
behavior
that
is
learn
or
if
one
is
just
born
that
way
imho
the
more
like
explan
is
that
it
some
combin
of
the
two
base
on
what
besid
your
own
warm
fuzzi
feel
but
thi
is
what
you
base
most
of
your
conclus
upon
warm
fuzzi
feel
mayb
he
ha
state
an
educ
opinion
base
upon
the
studi
that
involv
genet
and
psycholog
influenc
there
are
a
lot
of
those
type
of
studi
arent
there
tri
read
some
here
someth
to
ponder
upon
have
ani
of
you
gaybash
out
there
ever
consid
that
homosexu
probabl
deem
their
sexual
orient
a
be
a
state
of
affair
that
is
just
a
much
an
intrins
and
natur
part
of
their
life
a
heterosexu
do
about
their
own
sexual
in
other
word
someon
who
is
truli
alcohol
share
that
feel
until
they
hit
bottom
thi
is
a
crap
statement
and
comparison
mani
peopl
use
thi
sad
and
stupid
argument
there
is
not
relationship
between
alcohol
and
peopl
sexual
orient
except
that
some
may
find
what
it
realli
is
when
they
are
drunk
repress
inhibit
releas
unless
of
cours
the
problem
is
that
homosexu
is
a
form
of
mental
disord
caus
by
childhood
sexual
abus
a
a
number
of
recent
work
suggest
nonsens
thi
simpli
is
not
true
i
suppos
it
is
a
wast
of
time
to
tri
and
tell
you
to
understand
what
a
studi
present
most
of
what
you
cite
doe
not
extrapol
anyth
you
do
if
homosexu
would
stop
use
the
govern
to
impos
their
moral
on
other
antidiscrimin
law
and
leav
our
child
if
peopl
in
gener
would
stop
use
irrat
posit
to
oppress
other
and
leav
our
privat
life
to
ourselv
i
would
have
no
support
for
law
and
rule
to
protect
peopl
form
thi
but
we
need
onli
look
at
post
such
a
your
to
see
that
they
lack
ration
thought
and
intellig
outlook
alon
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
privat
but
until
they
get
over
the
liber
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
govern
is
to
tell
peac
peopl
how
to
live
i
have
no
choic
but
to
continu
to
point
out
that
homosexu
is
not
an
altern
lifestyl
but
a
sick
rememb
that
peac
peopl
are
not
necessarili
do
the
right
