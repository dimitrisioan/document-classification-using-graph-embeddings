i
think
that
thi

appar

note
that
the

i
beat

you
pay
your

and
you
take
your

me
i
lean
strongli
toward
the
against
argument
i
know
that
have
the
law
treat
everyon
a
equal
regardless
of
realiti
will
not
in
and
of
itself
lead
to
true
equal
and
in
fact
may
lead
at
time
toward
greater
inequ
nonetheless
i
believ
that
true
equal
is
at
least
possibl
when
the
law
treat
peopl
a
be
equal
while
true
equal
is
by
