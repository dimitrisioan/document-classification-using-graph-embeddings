then
there
the
other
side
an
articl
in
yesterday
atlanta

state
that
there
are
mani
scientist
who
have
misgiv
that
the
data
be
use
to
determin
whether

not
global
warm
is
occur
is
faulti
the
point
that
the
articl
made
is
that
all
long
term
temperatur
dataa
collect
ha
been
in
urban
area
and
that
ani
heat
rise
can
be
attribut
to
the
growth
and
urban
of
the
area
they
call
it
the
asphalt
temperatur
trend
we
have
no
real
long
term
data
on
remot
area
such
a
the
middl
of
the
amazon

or
the
top

mt
everest
or
the
gobi
desert
for
that
matter
an
accompani
articl
mention
that
a
group
of
scientist
at
nasa
had
develop
a
method
for
use
a
satellit
to
collect
temperatur
data
global
and
that
preliminari
result
show
a
slight
downward
trend
attribut
to
the
mt
pinatubo
erupt
it
went
on
to
say
that
even
with
the
current
downward
trend
there
appear
to
be
no
chang
