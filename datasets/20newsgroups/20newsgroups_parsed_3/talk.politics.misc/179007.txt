more
plausibl
than
a
mass
suicid
consid
that
the
davidian
were
an
apocalypt
cult
with
a
histori
of
arm
violenc
becaus
the
place
wa
a
tinder
box
with
straw
bale
for
insul
and
they
wouldnt
have
time
to
die
from
smoke
inhal
befor
the
fire
reach
them
those
peopl
burn
to
death
a
truli
horribl
and
agonizingli
pain
way
to
die
which
i
dont
think
even
a
fanat
would
willingli
inflict
on
himself
let

death
from

it
not
pleasant
to
anyon
who

who
thought
that
mass
suicid
wa
a

possibl
selfimmol
would
simpli
not
be
the
method

then
again
to
a

it
might
be
to

far
more
like
to

bomb
bullet
or
poison
koolaid
that
not
to
say
they
definit
didnt
do
it
i
dont
make
claim
either
way

i
find
the
idea
implaus
enough
to
want
to
see
the

thoroughli
inv
