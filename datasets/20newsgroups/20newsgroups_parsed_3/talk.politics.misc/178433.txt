daniel
b

write
gari
l
dare
write
the
differ
in
the
litig
environ
is
reflect
in
the
fee
lack
of
defens
medicin
and
nearabs
of
malpractic
is
realli
whi
we
spend
le
use
the
most
expens
approach
of
pure
insur
and
mayb
that
not
such
a
good
thing
i
also
read
somewher
that
it
is
next
to
imposs
in
canada
to
litig
against
the
health
systemclass
action
suit
are
nearli
imposs
and
you
cant
sue
the
provinci
health
offici
at
all
sinc
our
doctor
are
privat
and
the
system
is
just
an
insur
plan
litig
would
not
involv
the
insur
fund
our
lawyer
do
not
work
on
conting
so
that
if
you
were
to
sue
for
malpractic
then
youd
better
be
sure
of
win
to
cover
your
fee
likewis
if
you
were
a
doctor
and
subject
of
a
suit
it
time
to
sweat
sinc
the
provinci
wing
of
the
cma
are
the
one
that
go
to
bat
when
the
fee
schedul
hike
are
present
the
politicallyb
doctor
were
just
cackl
when
they
realiz
the
cma
would
grow
in
strength
rather
than
diminish
especi
when
unoppos
unlik
in
social
medicin
approach
like
britain
nation
health
servic
oh
no
dont
let
the
ama
know
about
thi
they
have
enough
power
a
it
is
ask
most
american
whether
theyd
like
the
doctor
lobbi
to
get
more
power
a
few
week
ago
the
presid
of
the
canadian
ma
wrote
a
letter
to
the
nyt
to
decri
a
lobbyist
advert
repeat
the
same
old
trash
thi
is
signific
becaus
the
ama
and
the
cma
are
interlink
organ
and
he
would
not
have
done
it
without
the
approv
of
hi
ama
croni
well
yeah
tell
u
about
the
nation
defens
medic
centr
outsid
ottawa
theoret
it
limit
to
servic
personnel
but
some
studi
ive
heard
about
have
suggest
that
about
half
the
patient
there
are
civilian
who
not
onli
have
connect
but
arent
urgent
at
all
it
serf
the
same
purpos
a
the
bethesda
naval
hospit
sinc
not
all
hospit
can
provid
everyth
mayb
they
have
some
stuff
that
other
dont
ottawa
popul
is
onli
a
quarter
million
if
you
includ
the
surround
counti
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospit
annual
budget
are
approv
by
the
govern
how
do
you
keep
polit
consider
out
of
medic
decis
i
bet
that
if
your
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friend
with
one
your
put
on
ani
hospit
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
your
someon
who
get
bump
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
peopl
of
influenc
will
get
their
way
in
ani
system
american
or
european
it
the
golden
rule
he
who
ha
the
gold
make
the
rule
a
for
annual
budget
those
are
actual
annual
grant
for
facil
eg
mop
pan
etc
given
to
hospit
of
which
most
are
privat
nonprofit
foundat
btw
i
have
no
problem
with
have
aggress
forprofit
hospit
like
the
french
who
use
our
approach
but
in
the
pari
region
they
have
almost
a
mani
peopl
a
canada
doe
so
their
market
is
much
more
divers
the
rest
ha
to
be
made
up
for
by
bill
from
patient
who
use
their
servic
wouldnt
nation
health
insur
mean
that
american
who
are
now
fulli
insur
might
have
to
settl
for
le
in
canada
provinci
insur
cover
all
health
cost
except
dental
care
eyeglass
prescript
drug
ambul
servic
and
privat
hospit
room
so
mani
canadian
do
end
up
buy
some
privat
insur
a
polici
to
cover
all
of
these
thing
run
about
to
a
month
hmm
how
much
differ
would
it
make
in
the
figur
of
percentag
of
gnp
spent
on
health
care
if
dentistri
and
optometri
were
includ
in
the
account
mayb
canada
spend
proportion
just
a
much
on
health
care
a
we
do
the
gdp
figur
are
combin
public
and
privat
expenditur
for
total
outlay
and
are
compil
use
the
same
method
by
the
oecd
that
yield
the
figur
for
the
u
so
what
happen
if
the
health
care
system
financi
collaps
how
they
are
collect
premium
and
im
an
advoc
of
have
copay
like
the
french
do
in
their
system
in
order
to
make
it
look
more
like
the
real
insur
that
it
is
the
privat
doctor
and
hospit
will
still
be
there
after
the
insur
hypoth
disappear
a
they
were
there
befor
it
appear
bob
rae
the
second
least
popular
man
in
ontario
warn
ontarian
a
few
year
ago
that
if
they
didnt
stop
crossbord
shop
in
such
huge
number
the
servic
they
expect
from
the
provinc
just
wont
be
there
in
a
few
year
for
one
thing
i
think
that
bob
rae
is
an
idiot
he
didnt
say
so
but
i
knew
he
meant
the
ohip
most
of
ohip
come
from
separ
premium
on
your
paycheck
if
you
are
a
player
he
want
to
spend
our
money
on
other
thing
than
the
health
insur
our
high
tax
are
high
for
other
spend
but
health
insur
which
is
separ
and
option
and
it
is
be
spent
in
a
nonpartisan
manner
by
everi
parti
ohip
is
just
a
health
insur
plan
it
doe
not
provid
ani
kind
of
health
care
that
is
up
to
you
and
your
privat
doctor
would
the
privat
insur
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
oblig
to
of
cours
they
could
eventu
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loath
to
do
so
and
out
of
practic
in
handl
such
basic
servic
too
some
of
the
compani
provid
extra
insur
are
subsidiari
of
american
compani
and
their
parent
provid
full
insur
down
here
regardless
all
firm
up
north
can
easili
turn
on
cabl
tv
to
see
how
well
the
american
firm
are
do
by
be
involv
in
basic
coverag
the
privat
firm
are
make
too
much
money
after
have
gotten
rid
of
basic
coverag
they
run
around
pat
them
self
on
the
back
for
their
own
cooper
in
provid
extra
for
those
peopl
who
deserv
it
when
privat
insur
realiz
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risk
involv
in
basic
insur
eg
neurosurgeri
versu
delux
amen
eg
have
to
call
granada
tv
to
replac
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someon
privat
hospit
room
they
start
to
pat
themselv
on
the
back
for
their
social
respons
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
privat
insur
publicli
warn
against
ani
thought
of
privat
routin
low
cost
part
of
that
provinc
public
health
insur
plan
again
i
doubt
american
would
like
give
the
insur
compani
that
much
power
i
half
wonder
if
the
canadian
health
insur
didnt
go
along
with
the
provinc
and
the
feder
govern
year
ago
becaus
they
knew
that
there
wa
a
good
chanc
of
the
public
system
go
bust
in
the
long
run
and
then
afterward
they
could
clean
up
okay
thi
sort
of
contradict
what
i
said
higher
up
but
it
anoth
possibl
theyd
have
an
ad
bonu
when
argu
against
govern
involv
in
their
industrya
they
could
then
point
to
it
failur
instead
of
just
cite
theoret
principl
i
agre
they
were
in
a
winwin
situat
but
right
now
it
seem
that
they
have
won
bigger
when
you
look
at
how
full
their
