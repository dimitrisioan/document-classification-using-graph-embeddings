q
georg
what
do
you
know
about
these
alleg
note
taken
by
bori
yeltsin
dure
one
of
the
meet
in
which
it
appear
that
the
presid
told
bori
yeltsin
not
to
trust
the
japanes
that
when
they
say
ye
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
that
a
complet
misread
of
what
happen
at
the
meet
the
context
of
the
convers
wa
that
presid
clinton
wa
actual
reassur
presid
yeltsin
at
the
time
about
hi
convers
with
prime
minist
miyazawa
over
the
kuril
island
and
the
prime
minist
belief
that
japan
would
play
a
construct
role
in
the
g
process
i
mean
thi
wa
a
casual
comment
about
japanes
courtesi
and
etiquett
but
overal
it
wa
in
the
context
of
a
convers
where
he
wa
reassur
presid
yeltsin
that
he
believ
the
japanes
were
seriou
about
their
commit
to
the
g
process
q
are
you
say
that
the
presid
said
that
when
the
japanes
say
ye
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulo
that
not
i
dont
know
the
exact
word
and
there
wa
a
much
longer
discus
about
he
did
say
someth
along
the
line
that
he
believ
that
on
thi
issu
prime
minist
miyazawa
intend
to
realli
go
forward
with
the
g
process
q
have
there
been
ani
attempt
to
explain
thi
to
the
japanes
becaus
appar
the
japanes
press
ha
pick
thi
up
and
there
appear
to
be
mr
stephanopoulo
ive
seen
the
report
in
the
japanes
press
and
it
actual
doe
put
the
situat
in
context
it
doe
talk
about
the
japanes
understand
the
japanes
point
of
view
i
dont
think
it
go
to
be
a
problem
i
believ
that
there
may
have
been
some
diplomat
context
just
to
clear
thing
up
but
im
not
posit
q
georg
wa
the
specif
comment
that
wa
made
specif
to
the
kuril
island
situat
or
wa
it
a
gener
observ
on
japanes
etiquett
mr
stephanopoulo
the
discus
wa
about
q
the
specif
comment
is
what
im
ask
about
that
ha
alleg
to
have
been
translat
from
the
russian
note
when
the
japanes
say
ye
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulo
well
it
wa
a
combin
i
mean
i
dont
think
that
the
whole
sentenc
i
think
that
the
specif
comment
wa
a
broad
gener
observ
follow
up
by
a
specif
finish
to
the
sentenc
where
he
said
in
thi
case
he
believ
that
prime
minist
miyazawa
mean
to
keep
the
commit
q
wa
he
say
it
faceti
first
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
it
wa
just
a
casual
observ
q
and
then
you
say
diplomat
contact
were
made
to
clear
it
up
ha
the
presid
sent
a
messag
mr
stephanopoulo
no
i
dont
think
the
presid
spoke
i
believ
that
secretari
christoph
ha
made
some
call
but
im
not
sure
exactli
how
mani
q
well
thi
obvious
is
a
bigger
deal
than
your
make
it
out
to
be
if
christoph
ha
had
to
make
some
call
mr
stephanopoulo
no
no
it
wa
just
that
we
got
the
report
in
vancouv
and
the
secretari
want
to
make
sure
that
it
wa
understood
and
make
sure
there
wa
absolut
no
mr
stephanopoulo
report
in
vancouv
and
the
secretari
want
to
make
sure
that
it
wa
understood
and
make
sure
there
is
absolut
no
misunderstand
and
i
dont
believ
there
is
on
q
what
is
our
posit
about
the
japanes
that
they
may
have
to
say
one
thing
but
actuali
mean
anoth
mr
stephanopoulo
no
the
posit
on
the
japanes
is
a
the
presid
state
to
presid
yeltsin
throughout
the
two
day
he
said
that
he
had
had
a
good
convers
with
prime
minist
miazawa
prior
to
the
summit
he
reiter
the
u
posit
the
longstand
support
for
the
japanes
posit
on
the
kuril
island
but
also
reiter
prime
minist
miazawa
commit
to
move
forward
on
the
g
process
and
to
play
a
construct
role
and
i
think
presid
yeltsin
wa
veri
glad
to
hear
that
q
after
listen
to
secretari
christoph
on
iraq
for
the
last
few
day
im
a
littl
confus
what
is
the
u
polici
do
you
want
to
see
saddam
hussein
overturn
mr
stephanopoulo
it
the
same
polici
that
secretari
christoph
ha
reiter
and
all
of
the
u
offici
have
reiter
we
expect
full
and
complet
and
unequivoc
complianc
with
all
un
resolut
right
now
we
do
not
have
that
complianc
q
throw
it
out
further
that
if
iraq
compli
saddam
cant
stay
in
offic
mr
stephanopoulo
right
i
think
that
that
our
judgment
is
that
it
is
not
possibl
for
saddam
hussein
to
compli
with
the
resolut
and
stay
in
power
but
the
import
point
is
that
we
expect
complianc
by
iraq
with
all
un
resolut
and
we
will
continu
to
demand
it
q
and
are
you
concern
the
iran
will
becom
the
domin
power
in
the
area
mr
stephanopoulo
secretari
christoph
ha
also
spoken
to
iran
over
the
last
sever
day
and
he
say
we
also
expect
full
iranian
complianc
with
all
intern
norm
and
stop
support
of
terror
q
that
a
veri
glib
statement
that
he
wont
stay
in
power
if
he
compli
with
un
resolut
on
what
logic
do
you
base
that
mr
stephanopoulo
right
now
saddam
hussein
is
not
compli
with
the
un
resolut
at
all
he
is
not
respect
the
right
of
hi
peopl
a
is
requir
by
the
un
resolut
he
is
not
fulli
compli
with
all
the
resolut
regard
inspect
he
is
not
fulli
compli
with
all
the
resolut
regard
armament
q
well
when
do
you
think
that
if
he
did
compli
he
would
be
out
of
power
mr
stephanopoulo
well
right
now
hi
power
rest
on
the
repress
of
hi
peopl
if
he
stop
do
that
it
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
stay
in
power
q
georg
back
on
the
stimulu
packag
whi
is
it
that
you
and
the
presid
accus
the
republican
of
play
pure
polit
and
perpetu
gridlock
whi
is
it
that
what
evid
do
you
have
that
they
just
dont
have
a
genuin
idealog
differ
with
you
that
in
good
faith
mr
stephanopoulo
well
the
fact
that
sever
time
in
the
past
the
republican
mani
of
the
one
who
are
now
lead
the
fight
for
the
filibust
have
support
the
veri
fund
they
now
seek
to
stop
most
especi
the
highway
fund
q
georg
in
regard
to
that
some
of
the
moder
republican
said
that
the
white
hous
er
by
not
be
more
open
to
them
dure
the
while
the
plan
wa
put
togeth
that
they
had
one
sort
of
proforma
meet
between
the
white
hous
and
the
senat
republican
and
that
wa
it
doe
the
administr
look
back
and
think
perhap
it
could
have
done
a
better
job
of
work
with
some
mr
stephanopoulo
well
im
not
sure
that
it
true
that
there
wa
onli
one
meet
i
mean
the
presid
met
with
the
republican
leadership
on
at
least
two
occas
befor
the
introduct
of
hi
packag
he
met
with
the
entir
senat
republican
caucu
also
for
lunch
and
went
up
there
we
are
continu
in
contact
with
a
mani
republican
a
we
can
find
who
have
an
interest
in
the
presid
packag
we
are
interest
in
what
they
have
to
say
a
well
but
we
believ
that
thi
program
is
import
and
were
go
to
continu
to
fight
for
it
q
your
all
or
noth
do
it
with
the
democrat
alon
strategi
did
you
mayb
miscalcul
the
abil
to
get
it
through
mr
stephanopoulo
well
i
mean
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
senat
rule
a
determin
minor
can
frustrat
activ
i
mean
there
is
just
no
question
about
that
you
onli
need
plu
one
to
keep
go
plu
one
to
keep
go
and
to
stop
ani
action
and
that
what
the
republican
are
do
q
go
to
rethink
the
way
you
attempt
to
get
other
thing
pas
a
you
go
through
thi
process
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
q
work
with
republican
and
tri
to
woo
some
republican
into
your
camp
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
were
go
to
continu
to
look
for
the
support
of
republican
whenev
we
can
get
it
on
the
presid
inti
q
but
on
thi
one
how
are
you
go
to
do
it
differ
than
you
did
it
on
thi
one
becaus
on
thi
one
you
realli
did
stiff
the
republican
from
the
begin
and
made
it
clear
that
it
wa
a
democrat
major
that
would
get
thi
through
and
could
get
it
through
and
you
realli
didnt
need
republican
vote
are
you
go
to
take
a
differ
tack
when
you
have
to
go
for
particular
vote
when
you
have
to
go
through
mr
stephanopoulo
i
cant
see
into
the
futur
and
understand
everi
possibl
turn
in
the
legisl
road
clearli
the
presid
go
to
continu
to
reach
out
when
he
can
q
you
dont
have
ani
regret
then
about
the
way
you
have
handl
it
up
to
now
and
you
dont
plan
ani
chang
in
your
approach
in
deal
with
the
republican
in
congress
base
on
thi
experi
mr
stephanopoulo
obvious
the
presid
would
like
hi
packag
pas
a
quickli
a
possibl
and
he
go
to
continu
to
press
for
that
we
will
continu
to
reach
out
to
republican
there
not
question
about
that
and
well
continu
to
reason
with
them
and
tri
and
find
appropri
avenu
for
cooper
in
thi
case
the
republican
have
chosen
to
unifi
around
a
filibust
around
a
plan
to
frustrat
action
not
a
plan
to
move
forward
q
theyr
be
deni
ani
other
legisl
mean
of
put
their
propos
forward
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
theyr
be
q
ani
idea
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
their
amend
are
be
defeat
i
dont
know
that
theyr
be
deni
q
to
present
them
mr
stephanopoulo
that
not
exactli
true
i
mean
they
get
the
vote
q
that
their
can
be
pas
though
by
the
parliamentari
rule
under
which
theyr
play
mr
stephanopoulo
unless
they
get
a
major
in
support
all
the
way
around
no
that
not
exactli
true
q
georg
one
more
on
iraq
is
the
administr
back
ani
of
the
iraqi
opposit
groom
ani
new
leadership
q
back
ani
of
the
iraqi
leadership
mr
stephanopoulo
oh
i
again
were
press
for
iraqi
complianc
i
dont
know
if
we
can
get
into
the
busi
of
groom
leadership
i
believ
there
have
been
some
contact
at
some
level
with
iraqi
opposit
group
i
dont
know
about
anyth
recent
q
jess

not
the
presid
best
friend

howev
been
told
that
there

kind
of

by

i

clearli
not
enough
q
did
reverend

ask
him
not

mr

im
not
sure
about

i
believ
the
character

reverend

is
talk
about
is
an
inform
pickett
i
dont
know
that
he
ask
him
not
to

to
the
ball
game
but
he
sent
a
long
detail
formal
letter
outlin
hi
concern
with
the
situat
in
major
leagu
basebal
and
the
presid
read
it
q
georg
the
oriol
are
play
the
ranger
the
manag
partner
of
the
ranger
is
georg
w
bush

he

there
and
is
he
go
to
meet
with
the
presid
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
know
q
what
is
the
mubarak
schedul
mr
stephanopoulo
i
know
that
presid
mubarak
is
come
tomorrow
morn
for
a
work
meet
they
will
have
a
lunch
and
i
believ
that
he
is
have
dinner
tonight
with
vice
presid
gore
q
and
joint
statement
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulo
i
believ
so
ye
at
the
end
ye
q
is
there
evid
georg
that
the
egyptian
did
warn
the
u
about
a
potenti
terrorist
bomb
terrorist
activ
mr
stephanopoulo
a
report
in
the
new
york
time
i
mean
i
think
that
presid
mubarak
did
say
that
there
ha
been
gener
convers
with
the
egyptian
a
there
have
been
for
a
long
period
of
time
we
do
have
gener
intellig
share
i
mean
but
presid
mubarak
wa
veri
care
to
point
out
that
there
wa
no
specif
inform
on
thi
visit
that
wa
pas
forward
the
presid
will
continu
to
investig
the
situat
but
he
also
reiter
hi
belief
that
we
can
not
toler
terror
of
ani
kind
q
georg
he
did
make
specif
or
the
egyptian
appar
did
issu
specif
warn
about
thi
individu
who
forgiv
me
thi
individu
who
forgiv
me
the
name
escap
me
at
the
moment
and
said
the
egyptian
were
more
or
le
rebuf
in
their
attempt
to
get
some
kind
of
action
mr
stephanopoulo
again
i
dont
know
if
i
would
agre
with
your
character
of
the
mubarak
interview
he
did
say
that
they
gave
gener
warn
about
the
possibl
of
a
network
in
the
unit
state
and
upon
which
we
took
appropri
action
but
there
wa
no
specif
inform
on
thi
specif
oper
at
all
q
so
the
white
hous
doesnt
feel
that
ani
of
the
law
enforc
agenc
whether
it
be
the
cia
or
fbi
who
would
have
receiv
thi
kind
of
inform
wa
lax
or
derelict
in
it
duti
in
not
pursu
some
kind
of
mr
stephanopoulo
no
not
at
all
q
what
next
with
serbia
it
got
onli
a
pas
mention
in
the
news
confer
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulo
you
didnt
get
to
ask
your
question
q
ye
exactli
wa
there
ani
agreement
on
concert
action
between
the
two
countri
and
even
if
there
wasnt
what
doe
the
u
do
next
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
the
u
is
clearli
go
to
move
forward
in
the
un
today
continu
discus
with
our
alli
on
a
sanction
resolut
and
well
continu
to
look
for
way
to
press
the
serbian
to
come
to
the
negoti
tabl
and
sign
an
agreement
q
georg
whi
do
you
think
sanction
is
still
an
option
i
mean
the
serbian
make
it
clear
that
at
least
the
leadership
is
surviv
just
fine
and
they
feel
like
they
can
wait
you
out
and
even
the
administr
offici
we
had
in
the
other
day
said
there
no
evid
that
theyr
go
to
have
an
effect
ani
time
soon
the
bosnian
serb
have
said
no
to
the
peac
plan
when
doe
no
mean
no
and
you
have
to
do
someth
differ
mr
stephanopoulo
well
i
mean
we
are
do
someth
differ
were
move
forward
on
further
sanction
through
the
un
and
those
discus
will
continu
were
go
to
continu
to
tri
and
tighten
the
noos
on
serbia
and
i
think
that
everi
opportun
we
have
to
do
that
will
have
an
effect
over
time
q
are
we
look
again
at
lift
the
