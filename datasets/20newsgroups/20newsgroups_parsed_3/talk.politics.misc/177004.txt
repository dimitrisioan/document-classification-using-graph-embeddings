write
i
suggest
you
listen
veri
care
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
hi
peopl
are
say
and
compar
that
with
the
veri
antiwest
slogan
come
from
hi
oppon
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
could
we
back
him
without
forc
other
to
back
him
at
the
point
of
a
gun
if
we
had
back
him
strongli
earli
on
i
doubt
there
would
be
the
problem
there
is
now
mani
russian
becam
disillus
with
democraci
and
reform
when
they
felt
rightli
imo
that
the
west
didnt
care
yeltsin
wa
virtual
promis
massiv
aid
onc
bush
got
over
hi
gorbymania
thi
probabl
kept
him
from
dismantl
the
congress
and
call
for
new
elect
well
the
aid
didnt
come
through
and
we
didnt
make
sure
it
went
to
the
proper
place
and
now
the
antireform
are
gain
strength
where
befor
they
were
in
hide
have
you
consid
a
noninterventionist
polici
if
market
reform
doe
happen
russia
will
certainli
get
privat
capit
at
privat
risk
to
help
their
economi
they
will
even
have
incent
to
do
so
for
the
same
reason
if
they
dont
reform
then
our
govern
will
probabl
consid
them
enemi
anyway
and
rather
spend
money
to
hurt
rather
than
help
them
if
they
dont
reform
i
dont
believ
in
give
them
money
howev
i
think
thi
is
too
import
to
take
a
noninterventionist
approach
thi
is
what
realli
bug
me
about
libertarian
it
sound
like
itll
all
be
the
same
in
a
hundr
year
time
no
need
to
do
anyth
how
doe
thi
affect
u
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
track
of
europ
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
someth
a
massiv
breakup
of
a
countri
that
span
th
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affect
here
of
cours
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democraci
should
help
other
democraci
or
struggl
democraci
if
a
billion
gift
wa
that
import
to
our
well
be
couldnt
it
be
rais
voluntarilli
peopl
alreadi
give
over
billion
a
year
to
chariti
despit
the
wish
of
libertarian
thi
societi
is
a
far
way
and
get
farther
from
be
libertarian
perhap
voluntari
gift
would
work
if
we
had
the
proper
framework
but
we
do
not
have
it
we
have
to
face
the
problem
now
not
in
x
year
when
we
have
a
libertarian
dream
societi
right
now
there
are
huge
stumbl
block
to
trade
let
alon
chariti
there
are
still
limit
to
hightech
export
nasa
cant
buy
proton
launch
vehicl
from
them
sure
the
market
may
be
abl
to
help
a
great
deal
but
it
cant
right
now
there
are
too
mani
obstacl
instead
of
fight
against
the
aid
you
should
be
fight
to
tear
down
the
obstacl
the
market
and
chariti
have
to
face
serious
everyon
ha
differ
opinion
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
caus
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong
space
program
someon
el
will
champion
welfar
or
educ
or
do
studi
of
drunken
goldfish
that
is
whi
we
have
a
republ
and
not
a
true
democraci
instead
of
gridlock
on
a
massiv
scale
we
onli
have
gridlock
on
a
congression
scale
it
seem
instead
of
gridlock
on
ani
scale
we
have
aid
to
russia
expens
space
program
nation
chariti
that
doesnt
help
the
poor
and
probabl
studi
of
drunken
goldfish
i
think
limit
govern
is
more
key
than
how
democrat
it
is
well
i
think
limit
govern
is
primarili
democrat
due
to
it
be
limit
but
the
main
question
is
how
do
you
transform
a
staterun
economi
and
monolith
govern
into
someth
that
even
remot
look
like
our
btw
sometim
it
seem
that
our
govern
is
tri
to
go
the
opposit
direct
it
is
not
go
to
be
painless
and
not
go
to
be
easi
we
simpli
can
not
wait
to
help
when
they
have
the
proper
govern
theyll
never
get
there
without
the
aid
it
may
be
too
late
alreadi
btw
who
is
to
decid
stupid
thi
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impos
their
moral
on
other
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarian
were
against
that
wa
an
opinion
and
libertarian
are
veri
big
on
free
speech
and
im
just
excercis
mine
actual
my
polit
are
pretti
libertarian
except
on
thi
one
issu
and
thi
is
whi
it
is
imposs
for
me
to
join
the
parti
it
seem
that
libertarian
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
if
you
are
pretti
libertarian
except
on
thi
one
issu
then
you
should
be
veri
libertarian
consid
it
a
compromis
how
much
money
would
your
fellow
russiaaid
have
to
give
to
russia
if
those
you
oppos
werent
use
the
same
govern
machin
to
steal
money
from
you
and
your
group
for
caus
you
dont
support
a
i
also
said
abov
anoth
problem
i
have
is
with
transform
a
libertarian
societi
is
not
go
to
happen
painlessli
or
overnight
i
have
seen
noth
about
how
to
take
our
current
govern
and
societi
and
turn
it
into
a
minim
govern
and
a
respons
selfsuffici
populac
we
could
do
that
year
ago
but
not
now
peopl
have
been
say
that
for
hundr
of
year
they
didnt
have
nuclear
weapon
year
ago
nor
instantan
commun
nor
travel
to
virtual
anyplac
on
the
earth
in
le
than
a
day
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
begin
of
a
global
economi
and
global
decis
make
all
the
more
reason
to
depend
on
the
free
market
which
can
more
effici
process
inform
than
to
depend
on
ruler
for
decis
on
complex
issu
ye
depend
on
the
ruler
of
the
free
market
and
the
busi
ruler
do
emerg
somewher
and
they
will
never
repres
the
opinion
of
everi
person
on
the
planet
there
must
be
check
and
balanc
check
on
the
govern
when
it
get
out
of
bound
and
check
on
industri
when
it
get
out
of

put
all
your
hope
on
the
benevol
of
the

is
to
