steve
your
the
one
who
suggest
that
a

should
be
an
ideal
prove

i
never
felt
that
way
in
the
first
place
quit
the
contrari
i
think
a
better
prove
ground
would
be
someplac
that
alreadi
had
a
governemnt
that
would
prevent
outright
act
of
agress
yet
had
a
strong
spirit
of
individu
and
initi
someplac
like
texa
mr
grinch
and
while
texa
taxpay
might
willingli
elimin
taxsupport
for

tamu
im
not
sure
theyd
support
gut
the

footbal

then
there
the
