a

the

there

let

that

for

off

on

the
new

i

is
one
which

crack
cocain
or

for
that

neither
is
it
an
approach
which
see
law
abid
citizen
hand
over
more
and
more
of
their
freedom
and
privaci
in
an
effort
to
track
down
illeg

until
the
land
of
the
free

the
home
of
the
brave
look
like
a
polic
state
here
then
is
my
propos
posse
and
use
of
all

illeg

is
decrimin
but
buy
and
sell
them
remain
illeg
pothead

dwindl
if
these

be

buy
them
nevertheless
there
will
be
those
who
will
seek
to
sell
these
noncommerci

even
at

therefor
law
enforc

is
concentr

and
also
on

commit
by

too

here
is
where
the
