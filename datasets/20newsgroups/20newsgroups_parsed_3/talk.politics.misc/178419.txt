write
of
cours
one
again
face
the
question
of
how
one
circumscrib
govern
power
and
keep
it
circumscrib
in
a
complex
societi
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalist
nor
consum
to
refrain
from
use
govern
power
for
their
own
end
but
apart
from
that
littl
conundrum
without
have
a
complet
answer
to
thi
question
i
should
think
it
obviou
that
the
first
step
should
be
to
convinc
peopl
thi
would
be
a
desir
result
there
are
still
quit
a
lot
of
peopl
who
feel
that
the
command
economi
of
eastern
europ
fail
due
to
corrupt
rather
than
essenti
weak
of
caommand
economi
and
you
still
have
a
major
in
thi
nation
that
favor
keep
unenforc
and
unenforc
law
on
the
book
in
order
to
send
a
signal
it
would
seem
that
a
societi
with
a
fail
govern
would
be
an
ideal
set
for
libertarian
ideal
to
be
implement
now
