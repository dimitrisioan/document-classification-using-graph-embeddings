and
were
tri
to
get
off
to
a
good
start
thi
summer
with
a
program
that
would
creat
more
than
new
summer
job
includ
mani
thousand
that
have
a
strong
educ
compon
so
our
young
peopl
can
be
learn
and
work
at
the
same
time
dick
i
think
i
ought
to
stop
there
that
a
good
place
we
can
begin
i
think
the
discus
secretari
riley
thank
you
so
much
mr
presid
each
month
we
get
togeth
and
talk
about
way
that
all
citizen
can
work
toward
reach
the
nation
educ
goal
and
tonight
well
focu
on
goal
five
and
how
commun
such
a
your
can
prepar
student
for
thi
world
of
work
thi
week
the
educ
depart
and
the
labor
depart
are
host
a
confer
here
in
washington
dc
call
summer
challeng
a
program
of
work
and
learn
to
america
youth
the
aim
is
to
use
some
special
fund
from
presid
clinton
propos
econom
stimulu
packag
to
provid
educationallyenrich
job
and
summer
school
program
for
young
peopl
in
disadvantag
area
of
the
countri
mr
presid
let
talk
a
minut
you
allud
to
it
somewhat
about
the
summer
youth
challeng
your
program
call
for
more
educ
enrich
in
the
summer
job
and
whi
in
your
word
is
that
so
import
the
presid
i
think
it
import
for
two
reason
first
of
all
a
lot
of
the
young
peopl
were
tri
to
reach
may
have
had
troubl
adjust
to
school
and
learn
and
while
we
want
them
to
have
a
good
experi
with
a
real
job
we
also
want
them
to
continu
to
learn
dure
the
summer
becaus
we
know
from
a
lot
of
research
that
a
lot
of
kid
that
have
troubl
learn
in
school
may
forget
a
much
a
percent
of
what
they
learn
the
previou
year
over
the
summertim
and
that
is
a
veri
unproduct
thing
for
school
to
have
to
take
up
a
lot
of
time
teach
what
they
alreadi
taught
befor
secondli
we
want
to
help
these
young
peopl
progress
not
onli
in
term
of
work
but
in
term
of
learn
we
want
to
abolish
the
artifici
divid
line
between
what
is
work
and
what
is
learn
becaus
we
think
that
the
best
and
most
product
worker
will
have
to
be
lifetim
learner
and
we
think
that
thi
experi
could
mayb
drive
that
point
home
and
prepar
these
young
peopl
to
succeed
in
school
or
at
work
or
in
colleg
a
they
go
on
secretari
riley
well
i
think
the
fact
that
these
are
disadvantag
kid
that
gap
that
lag
you
mention
a
they
go
into
the
next
year
is
realli
even
greater
secretari
reich
of
cours
you
have
train
program
throughout
the
year
and
i
wonder
is
you
have
ani
comment
about
thi
educ
compon
of
train
secretari
reich
well
what
weve
learn
mr
secretari
is
that
for
mani
young
peopl
whether
it
for
the
summer
or
for
the
year
actual
onthejob
work
experi
combin
with
educ
is
one
of
the
best
way
of
learn
mani
young
peopl
for
exampl
have
a
lot
they
have
a
difficult
time
learn
geometri
but
when
they
actual
are
there
build
someth
or
work
on
someth
and
they
can
see
the
exact
and
direct
applic
of
geometri
they
understand
what
it
use
for
and
a
lot
of
young
peopl
just
that
sen
of
connect
between
educ
and
the
world
of
work
is
terribl
terribl
import
it
import
dure
the
summer
but
it
import
for
a
lot
of
young
peopl
even
beyond
the
summer
secretari
riley
thank
you
mr
presid
youv
call
for
a
youth
apprenticeship
program
schooltowork
transit
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
tell
u
a
littl
bit
about
your
concept
of
that
and
how
you
see
it
develop
the
presid
well
first
of
all
let
talk
about
whi
it
import
most
new
job
that
will
be
creat
in
thi
decad
will
not
requir
a
fouryear
colleg
degre
but
most
of
them
will
requir
some
learn
and
skill
that
go
well
beyond
what
most
peopl
get
in
a
high
school
diploma
if
you
look
at
the
last
year
the
averag
salari
of
young
peopl
that
had
at
least
two
year
of
good
posthigh
school
educ
wa
a
good
salari
that
went
up
over
the
decad
the
young
peopl
who
had
le
than
that
tend
to
have
lower
wage
that
did
not
go
up
and
in
mani
case
in
real
term
fell
over
the
decad
becaus
they
werent
product
they
werent
more
valuabl
to
their
employ
so
we
think
america
ha
a
big
econom
interest
in
tri
to
ensur
that
all
the
young
peopl
who
get
out
of
high
school
but
dont
go
on
to
colleg
make
a
transit
to
work
which
includ
two
year
of
further
train
either
in
a
commun
colleg
a
vocat
set
or
perhap
on
the
job
and
what
i
have
done
in
thi
budget
a
you
know
is
to
give
you
and
secretari
reich
some
fund
and
some
incent
to
tri
to
work
in
partnership
with
state
and
with
the
privat
sector
to
build
these
program
statebyst
in
a
way
that
would
be
custom
essenti
by
the
busi
commun
base
on
the
need
of
the
economi
in
ani
given
area
it
could
revolution
longterm
the
qualiti
of
the
american
work
forc
and
the
earn
of
american
worker
secretari
reich
i
should
add
mr
presid
i
think
you
know
thi
from
your
experi
in
arkansa
and
mani
of
the
peopl
watch
thi
program
that
the
busi
commun
and
educ
labor
group
are
alreadi
in
mani
of
our
commun
mani
of
our
state
build
a
schooltowork
transit
program
in
fact
there
an
aw
lot
of
ferment
a
lot
of
excit
the
peopl
watch
thi
program
probabl
are
the
one
who
are
most
directli
involv
in
that
and
more
power
to
them
secretari
riley
and
i
are
go
to
do
everyth
we
can
to
build
on
the
success
alreadi
out
there
secretari
riley
bob
were
go
to
be
talk
tonight
about
youth
apprenticeship
and
tech
prep
the
coop
learn
career
academi
and
what
featur
all
those
program
that
deal
with
thi
subject
what
are
some
of
the
featur
that
everi
one
of
these
schooltowork
program
might
have
that
are
import
secretari
reich
well
one
thing
that
weve
seen
and
you
and
i
have
been
work
at
thi
for
a
long
time
and
you
much
longer
than
i
weve
seen
that
activ
involv
of
the
busi
commun
is
absolut
essenti
and
im
so
delight
that
were
do
thi
in
the
headquart
of
the
chamber
of
commerc
the
chamber
of
commerc
of
the
unit
state
is
commit
to
do
these
kind
of
program
train
educ
retrain
and
weve
aim
to
work
veri
close
with
the
chamber
the
busi
commun
is
go
to
be
activ
engag
in
develop
almost
an
audit
of
the
kind
of
job
that
are
need
and
help
the
educ
commun
colleg
technic
institut
develop
curriculum
that
are
relev
for
the
job
of
the
futur
commun
have
got
to
come
togeth
i
mean
thi
is
one
of
the
most
import
thing
youv
got
to
have
all
of
these
player
in
a
commun
come
togeth
and
work
togeth
and
cooper
togeth
you
know
too
often
we
have
the
educ
over
here
and
the
busi
leader
over
here
labor
group
over
here
and
everybodi
is
talk
but
theyr
not
realli
work
togeth
in
a
common
strategi
and
the
third
and
final
ingredi
i
would
say
dick
would
be
a
commit
to
excel
a
commit
both
to
academ
excel
and
also
to
skill
develop
excel
thi
is
not
a
track
program
were
talk
about
for
kid
who
are
not
go
to
make
it
thi
is
a
program
that
everi
young
person
ought
to
be
elig
for
if
they
want
to
go
on
beyond
that
to
fouryear
colleg
that
fine
that
ought
to
be
permiss
but
were
talk
about
the
foundat
of
learn
about
job
the
foundat
skill
for
onthejob
learn
and
again
those
are
the
critic
compon
it
alreadi
be
done
the
presid
i
think
if
i
might
just
interject
one
point
base
on
my
person
experi
at
home
the
busi
commun
ha
a
critic
role
to
play
not
simpli
in
say
here
are
the
job
skill
that
are
need
and
here
what
ought
to
be
taught
but
also
in
monitor
that
excel
if
you
have
the
right
sort
of
partnership
there
the
peopl
who
are
pay
the
tax
and
who
are
go
to
then
be
hire
the
worker
are
not
go
to
permit
the
secondr
program
to
surviv
if
they
have
ani
way
to
shape
and
influenc
them
so
i
think
that
veri
import
and
when
we
tri
to
if
you
will
fill
in
the
blank
at
the
feder
level
tri
to
set
some
standard
and
provid
some
fund
one
of
the
thing
that
we
want
to
be
sure
and
do
is
to
make
sure
that
the
employ
ha
a
heavi
amount
of
influenc
over
the
qualiti
of
these
program
becaus
that
realli
what
go
to
determin
whether
the
whole
thing
is
worthwhil
secretari
riley
that
great
weve
been
talk
of
cours
about
schooltowork
and
also
the
job
and
econom
recoveri
program
for
thi
summer
and
fall
but
let
talk
just
a
moment
about
longterm
school
reform
it
someth
especi
close
to
me
mr
presid
i
wonder
if
you
would
give
u
some
of
your
idea
for
the
commun
out
here
on
goal
legisl
that
i
think
will
be
come
forth
befor
too
long
the
presid
well
a
you
know
back
when
you
and
i
were
both
governor
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
work
on
our
public
school
and
we
tri
to
be
veri
candid
with
our
peopl
in
say
that
a
lot
of
these
thing
were
go
to
take
some
time
to
materi
i
had
a
hand
in
write
the
nation
educ
goal
that
the
governor
draft
along
with
repres
of
presid
bush
administr
back
in
and
what
were
go
to
tri
to
do
thi
year
with
your
leadership
is
to
introduc
legisl
in
congress
that
will
actual
defin
the
thing
that
the
nation
govern
ought
to
do
to
tri
to
help
the
local
school
and
the
child
of
thi
countri
and
the
adult
learner
too
meet
those
goal
make
sure
that
when
by
peopl
show
up
for
school
readi
to
learn
that
we
get
a
percent
ontim
high
school
graduat
rate
that
child
at
the
th
th
and
th
grade
are
confid
in
the
subject
theyr
suppos
to
know
that
they
are
second
to
none
in
math
and
scienc
that
are
school
are
safe
disciplin
and
drugfre
and
of
cours
the
fifth
goal
i
took
them
out
of
line
to
say
thi
the
last
is
that
we
have
a
system
of
lifelong
learn
in
thi
countri
and
each
one
of
those
goal
there
a
nation
role
a
state
role
a
school
role
school
district
role
and
a
privat
sector
role
and
what
youv
attempt
to
do
in
thi
bill
your
go
to

that

veri
excit
so
far
a
i
know
noth
quit
like

ha
ever
been
done
in
the
form
of
feder
legisl
befor
not
mandat
and
tell
peopl
what
they

actual
set
up

so
that

can
do
our

im
realli
excit
about

entir
new

of
it
relationship
with

serv
a
a

realli
to
support
and
facilit
and
to
help
out
in
these
educ
reform
effort
all
driven
by
high
standard
that
the
point
bob
let
me
ask
you
one
question
and
then
well
get
to
the
telephon
call
it
about
the
same
subject
we
have
of
cours
skill
standard
that
are
go
to
be
part
of
goal
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
comment
on
that
secretari
reich
well
you
know
we
have
percent
of
our
young
peopl
who
dont
graduat
from
colleg
veri
often
they
dont
have
veri
mani
altern
they
do
have
a
wonder
system
of
commun
colleg
and
technic
institut
but
if
we
had
nation
skill
standard
to
which
they
could
aspir
and
which
employ
would
understand
a
a
nation
credenti
mani
of
these
young
peopl
would
actual
find
that
they
were
much
more
elig
for
job
everybodi
doesnt
have
to
go
to
colleg
other
countri
you
have
smaller
proport
of
their
popul
go
to
colleg
but
you
have
a
whole
level
of
peopl
who
have
certain
technic
preprofession
skill

can
do
it
in
thi
countri
if

develop
those
nation
skill
standard

be
work
with
the
state
with
the
educ
depart
with
a
lot
of
privat
industri
in

of

more
importantli
how
can
famili
and
the
local
commun
be
more
involv
use
the
feder
initi
that
someth
that
we
believ
is
veri
import
to
success
in
thi
effort
secretari
riley
mr
presid
the
presid
i
think
ill
give
everybodi
a
chanc
to
answer
the
question
bruce
but
let
me
first
thank
you
for
call
and
thank
you
for
all
the
great
work
that
your
do
in
austin
ive
seen
some
of
it
and
ive
alway
been
veri
impress
first
with
regard
to
the
summer
program
we
hope
we
can
structur
it
in
a
way
that
will
enabl
u
to
continu
the
summer
program
and
that
will
move
a
lot
of
these
young
peopl
back
into
school
under
circumst
that
might
allow
them
to
do
some
work
in
the
privat
sector
too
we
hope
that
secretari
reich
is
go
to
tri
to
set
up
a
system
where
we
creat
a
lot
of
privat
sector
job
to
be
match
with
the
public
sector
job
thi
summer
and
were
work
on
that
secondli
in
the
program
that
i
have
present
to
the
congress
over
the
next
five
year
what
we
are
attempt
to
do
is
to
build
in
an
amount
of
invest
that
quit
substanti
for
job
train
program
for
schooltowork
program
all
of
which
give
heavi
heavi
weight
to
local
commun
input
just
the
question
you
ask
but
do
provid
some
feder
invest
dollar
which
we
hope
you
can
put
with
local
dollar
to
keep
peopl
work
and
be
train
on
a
yearround
basi
and
i
will
say
again
to
echo
what
secretari
reich
said
a
moment
ago
to
tri
to
break
down
the
barrier
between
what
is
seen
a
work
and
what
is
seen
a
learn
an
aw
lot
of
young
peopl
actual
have
quit
high
iq
but
actual
learn
so
much
better
when
theyr
do
than
when
theyr
read
or
just
listen
so
we
hope
that
the
commun
involv
part
of
it
will
be
perman
and
we
hope
that
if
the
whole
budget
pas
and
we
do
have
budget
cut
and
more
than
actual
in
the
budget
and
some
revenu
raiser
and
some
new
money
for
educ
and
train
that
well
be
abl
to
do
just
what
you
seem
to
want
base
on
your
question
bob
do
you
want
to
say
anyth
secretari
reich
well
you
took
most
of
the
word
out
of
my
mouth
mr
presid
a
usual
but
let
me
just
add
one
thing
and
that
is
that
one
of
the
most
import
aspect
of
posthigh
school
for
a
lot
of
young
peopl
who
are
not
go
on
to
colleg
in
addit
to
the
schooltowork
program
simpli
is
the
avail
of
job
and
weve
got
to
get
thi
economi
move
again
obvious
it
terribl
import
to
get
thi
recoveri
program
to
get
the
economi
back
on
track
that
sort
of
the
prerequisit
to
everyth
el
if
we
dont
get
the
economi
back
on
track
we
have
i
think
thi
is
the
th
correct
me
if
im
wrong
mr
presid
i
think
is
the
th
month
we
have
had
seven
percent
unemploy
or
greater
thi
is
a
jobless
recoveri
a
lot
of
those
kid
are
go
to
be
get
out
of
school
in
june
and
even
if
we
did
everyth
right
they
would
have
a
veri
veri
hard
time
get
job
secretari
riley
thank
you
both
of
cours
goal
will
be
a
perman
longterm
thing
that
will
certainli
reach
into
next

it
will
involv
if
pas
and
we
certainli
hope
it
will
be
action
plan
with
everi
state
where
we
can
be
work
togeth
to
reach
for
the
goal
in
a
number
of
differ
way
and
then
the
state
with
all
the
variou
school
district
a
veri
import
part
of
that
will
be
citizen
and
parent
involv
and
i
think
everybodi
will
see
a
great
energi
out
there
onc
we
get
that
move
the
next
call
is
dr
harri
heinemann
new
york
doctor
q
good
even
mr
secretari
it
is
a
pleasur
to
be
on
with
you
thi
even
a
you
may
know
bridg
the
school
and
work
ha
been
central
to
la
guardia
educ
program
sinc
it
incept
in
the
s
and
that
includ
the
colleg
the
two
altern
high
school
that
oper
on
our
campu
and
the
linkag
we
have
forg
with
the
local
school
we
have
found
thi
to
be
an
extrem
effect
learn
strategi
and
over
the
year
weve
come
to
believ
that
there
are
sever
principl
that
are
veri
import
in
bridg
the
school
and
work
and
these
includ
integr
theori
in
the
classroom
with
practic
in
the
workplac
with
provid
all
student
earli
exposur
to
career
a
well
a
provid
opportun
for
them
to
reflect
upon
these
experi
while
they
strengthen
their
skill
and
lastli
the
critic
role
of
the
liber
art
particularli
in
the
develop
of
high
perform
compet
my
question
then
is
how
can
the
gener
educ
faculti
and
the
academ
curriculum
be
more
close
integr
with
transit
to
work
experi
and
what
mechan
and
strategi
can
you
suggest
to
achiev
thi
integr
secretari
riley
well
thank
you
veri
much
i
think
and
well
get
a
respons
from
you
all
on
that
and
veri
interest
work
go
on
there
were
go
to
have
three
peopl
our
next
guest
on
the
program
thi
even
that
will
be
some
specialist
in
that
area
that
your
speak
and
ill
certainli
pas
that
on
to
them
and
we
can
discus
it
later
you
all
care
to
comment
ani
comment
you
might
have
the
presid
id
just
like
to
say
if
i
might
one
thing
i
want
to
reemphas
thi
and
i
dont
think
im
be
a
clear
about
it
a
id
like
although
i
think
at
least
one
of
the
peopl
who
will
be
on
the
second
panel
will
be
abl
to
say
it
more
explicitli
than
i
i
think
thi
whole
concept
of
appli
academ
is
veri
import
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
basic
abolish
what
i
consid
to
be
a
veri
artifici
distinct
between
what
is
vocat
learn
and
what
is
academ
learn
i
think
we
should
keep
the
liber
art
go
i
think
we
should
have
a
strong
compon
for
peopl
who
are
in
the
vocat
program
secretari
reich
it
seem
to
me
that
we
also
need
to
rethink
our
entir
track
system
becaus
a
lot
of
these
school
and
work
combin
are
import
for
mainstream
student
theyr
import
for
all
student
it
not
just
a
special
group
of
student
that
need
them
some
of
the
experi
that
ive
seen
around
the
unit
state
dick
im
sure
youv
seen
them
a
well
are
mainstream
experi
theyr
mainstream
all
the
student
at
th
and
th
grade
theyr
give
them
a
combin
work
and
school
experi
and
then
a
transit
program
and
again
the
kid
can
either
go
on
to
colleg
if
they
want
they
can
go
on
to
technic
commun
they
can
go
on
to
an
entir
a
larg
varieti
of
possibl
and
career
direct
but
we
have
to
get
away
from
the
stigmat
that
often
goe
on
with
young
peopl
who
simpli
are
do
jobrel
or
work
relat
work
within
the
classroom
within
our
school
secretari
riley
thank
you
veri
much
i
think
that
go
to
be
the
last
call
that
we
have
time
for
mr

to
move
on

matter

want
to
thank
you
