utopia
is
not
an
option
utopia
is
a
myth
although
we
can
do
a
lot
better
than
what
we
have
today
but
i
think
that
you
must
pitch
libertarian
a
a
progress
agenda
ie
you
can
do
better
under
our
style
of
system
i
admir
a
lot
of
what
the
libertarian
stand
for
but
you
guy
are
some
of
the
worst
salesman
i
have
ever
seen
and
when
it
come
to
polit
you
need
salesman
whether
you
want
them
or
not
what
we
need
are
more
peopl
who
agre
with
u
know
someth
about
marketin
and
are
will
to
both
do
that
market
and
teach
other
how
to
are
you
in
im
flatter
by
your
invit
but
im
afraid
you
have
the
wrong
person
although
i
complet
agre
with
your
civil
liberti
agenda
im
not
in
support
of
your
econom
agenda
what
i
do
like
about
the
libertarian
parti
is
that
you
guy
are
so
good
at
shake
up
the
tire
idea
of
the
past
i
encourag
you
guy
to
continu
your
