i
dare
you
a
friend
of
mine
who
smoke

i
realli
wish

and
have
more
peopl
screw
up
in
the
head
im
sorri
about
your

realli
but
thi
anecdot
doe
noth
to
justifi
the
war
on
drug
if
anyth
it
demonstr
that
the

is
a
miser
failur
what
it
demonstr
is
that
peopl
will
take

if
they
want
to
legal
or
not
perhap
if
your
friend
were
take
legal
regul
drug

do
agre
with
you
in
a
way
the
war
on

ha
fail
but
in
my
opinion
that

onli
chang
the
tactic
for
instanc
here
are
how
some
penalti
should
be
chang
deal
coke
death
deal
heroin
death
deal
pot
death
deal
crack
death
the
list
go
on
and
on
just
kid
howev
on
a
more
seriou
note
i
do
believ
that
we
should
take
some
money
away
from
the
foriegn
oper
in
south
america
and
costli
border
interdict
effort
dont
think
im
go

good
so
far
from
what
i
heard
with
a
decreas
in
cost
lower
addict
rate
by

out
the
dealer
market
etc
but
that
wa
the
onli
thing
