situat
by
the
way
they
handl
the
origin
raid
it
wa
well
known
that
koresh
regularli
went
jog
outsid
hi
properti
he
could
have
been
serv
with
a
search
warrant
then
he
could
have
been
arrest
if
he
had
refus
to
compli
instead
offic

with
grenad
invad
the
properti
thi
escal
into
a
shoot
war
with
tragic
death
on
both
side
those
were
the
first
two
mistak
the
bad
judgment
of
ask
for
a
noknock
warrant
and
the
bad
and
probabl
illeg
way
the
alreadyunwis
warrant
wa
serv
at
thi
point
the
situat
escal
to
where
it
wa
describ
a
an
arm
standoff
and
a
hostag
crisi
that
when
the
govern
start
cover
their
trace
seal
the
warrant
revis
their
report
histori
of
the
incid
etc
thing
were
alreadi
build
up
to
disast
now
the
govern
could
have
simpli
close
the
suppli
rout
and
wait
but
accord
to
janet
reno
that
option
had
never
been
serious
consid
so
supposedli
becaus
the
agent
were
frustrat
and
fatigu
and
becaus
there
supposedli
were
no
backup
they
felt
they
had
to
go
in
ye
the
govt
handl
it
in
the
rambo
hollywood
type
style
with
extreem
machismo
perhap
that
not
the
way
to
handl
it
it
is
a
complet
differ
thing
to
start
assert
a
mani
have
done
that
the
govern
is
primarili
to
blame
the
comparison
with
the
nazi
in
particular
are
pure

sinc
you
have
provid
a
construct
opinion
on
the
issu
your
post
desrev
to
be
taken
serious
peter
nelson
also
made
some
veri
good
point
about
how
a
low
key
approach
might
have
been
more
effect
the
point
is
though
that
you
learn
through
mistak
the
govt
play
the
wrong
card
and
lost
that
not
a
big
deal
they
had
had
four
guy
murder
at
the
begin
and
maybe
they
just
were
not
prepar
for
wuit
thi
situat
who
could
be
if
the
same
thing
were
to
happen
all
over
again
we
might
perhap
be
abl
to
castig
the
govt
if
they
use
the
same
tactic
and
fail
in
the
same
way
a
it
is
i
cant
say
that
i
would
not
have
made
the
same
mistak
maybe
i
wouldnt
becaus
i
dont
a
a
rule
go
in
for
a
confront
situat
if
i
can
avoid
it
maybe
i
would
becaus
with
all
those
press
about
it
veri
difficult
not
to
tri
the
macho
stuff
the

base
on

they
knew
that
koresh
had
chicken
out
of
one
suicid
attempt
thi
may
have
been
the
reason
whi
they
consid
that
