test
in

jeffri

write
i
would
be
upset
that
although
abort
would
continu
they
would
be
a
lot
more
expens
for
the
rich
and
a
lot
le
safe
for
the
poor
so
now
thing
are
suppos
to
be
legal
just
to
keep
their
cost
down
and
the
safeti
factor
high
in
the
case
of
victimless
crime
ye
i
think
so
think
about
it
if
i
rob
or
beat
up
or
rape
or
kill
someon
it
veri
clear
to
anyon
not
a
sociopath
that
ive
done
someth
immor
on
the
other
hand
if
i
smoke
grass
or
have
sex
with
a
consent
adult
in
a
manner
illeg
in
that
state
the
moral
or
immor
of
that
act
is
mere
a
lifestyl
choic
it
doesnt
clearli
hurt
anyon
el
imo
if
such
an
act
doesnt
hurt
anoth
person
it
should
not
be
interf
with
think
about
it
shouldnt
all
drug
then
be
legal
it
would
lower
the
cost
and
definit
make
them
safer
to
use
i
think
so
and
i
dont
use
drug
outsid
of
the
legal
one

and
