are
not
mani
homosexu
a
kinsey
report
in
hi
survey
and
the
survey
of
the

sinc
then
you
say
that
the
reason
mani
young
peopl
are
promiscu
is
becaus
homosexu
form
a
larg
part
of
that
group
or
there
are
some
homosexu
whose
life
consist
of
have
sex
with
no
gap
for
eat
c
use

would
seem
to
suggest
that
on
averag
gay

have
about
partner
each
a
week
tri
to
think
through
your
argument
care
or
