thi
is
a
strawman
argument
and
fail
on
sever
ground
in
thi
case
limit
and
big
govern
are
not
defin
i
would
point
out
that
lebanon
somalia
and
the
former
yugoslavia
are
by
some
definit
nation
with
limit
govern
while
the
u
canada
and
nation
in
western
europ
where
peopl
would
rather
live
are
often
point
out
a
nation
with
big
govern
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
well
let
me
help
by
explain
the
differ
between
a
linit
govern
and
a
fail
govern
a
limit
govern
ha
it
power
clearli
circumscrib
but
is
fulli
capabl
of
enforc
it
decis
within
those
circumscrib
area
a
fail
govern
is
incap
of
enforc
it
decis
except
sporadicli
two
complet
differ
beast
of
cours
one
again
face
the
question
of
how
one
circumscrib
govern
power
and
keep
it
circumscrib
in
a
complex
societi
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalist
nor
consum
to
refrain
from
use
govern
power
for
their
own
end
but
apart
from
that
littl
conundrum
it
would
seem
that
a
societi
with
a
fail
govern
would
be
an
ideal
set
for
libertarian
ideal
to
be
implement
now
whi
do
you
suppos
that
never
seem
to
occur
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limit
govern
and
those
who
want
unlimit
govern
it
is
between
those
who
believ
govern
regul
in
a
capitalist
economi
serf
worthwhil
end
and
those
who
believ
such
regul
is
neither
desir

ground
nor

regul
is
such
a
