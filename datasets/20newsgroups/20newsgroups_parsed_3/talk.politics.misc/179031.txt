the
trade
in
illeg
drug
is
respons
for
much
of
the
crime
which
afflict
our
nation
there
is
much
evid
that
it
is
the
fact
that
the
drug
are
illeg
not

the

for

there

everi

the

consumpt
a

not
onli
the
innoc
peopl
unfortun
enough
to
be
caught
in

crossfir
but
i
would
argu
the
drug

themselv
a
great
argument
for
make
drug
legal
thank
you
how
could
you
have
miss
the
point
so
utterli
whathavey
been
smoke
here
then
is
my
propos
possess
and
use
of
all
present
illeg
drug
is
decrimin
but
buy
and
sell
them
remain
illeg
pothead
can
grow
their
own
marijuana
a
mani
alreadi
do
today
other
drug
user
can
legal
import
their
poison
of
choic
a
long
a
they
pay
the
tariff
and
a
barter
economi
of
drug
experiment
develop
your
solut
ha
done
noth
to
elimin
the
violenc
in
the
drug
trade
btw
how
is
someon
go
to
import
a
drug
if
buy
it
is
illeg
i
think
you
need
to
think
your
solut
through
a
littl
more
thouroughli
obvious
import
will
not
be
buy
drug
in
the
u
under
u
jurisdict
use
your
remain
brain
cell
becaus
of
the
barter
economi
which
suppli
the
drug
user
the
black
market
profit
that
have
so
enrich
the
drug
lord
dwindl
if
these
drug
can
be
obtain
for
free
or
next
to
noth
whi
buy
them
nevertheless
there
will
be
those
who
will
seek
to
sell
these
noncommerci
drug
even
at
rel
low
price
therefor
you
have
fail
to
indic
how
these
drug
can
be
obtain
for
free
or
next
to
noth
you
have
state
that
the
sale
of
them
is
illeg
ok
ill
spell
it
out
for
you
barter
economi
mean
that
drug
user
will
be
permit
to
grow
or
synthes
chemic
anyth
they
choos
or
to
buy
it
outsid
the
u
and
bring
it
in
if
it
wont
grow
here
they
will
also
be
permit
to
trade
with
other
drug
user
for
drug
other
than
the
one
they
themselv
grow
or
manufactur
they
will
not
howev
be
abl
to
legal
sell
their
drug
for
money
both
manufactur
and
import
of
noncommerci
drug
will
be
tax
to
discourag
their
use
thi
is
your
brain
on
drug
ani
question
law
enforc
activ
is
concentr
on
those
individu
who
continu
to
buy
and
sell
and
also
on
the
crime
commit
by
drug
user
too
poor
to
afford
even
low
price
but
here
is
where
the
strategi
begin
to
differenti
between
the
drug
dealer
the
victim
and
the
drug
user
their
victim
in
most
citi
thi
is
alreadi
the
strategi
it
ha
alreadi
fail
and
is
drag
the
rest
of
u
down
with
it
pardon
me
but
possessionus
of
these
drug
is
still
a
crime
you
can
not
analog
the
rate
at
which
drug
user
would
seek
treatment
and
the
compar
eas
with
which
it
could
be
made
avail
today
when
these

are
