if
someon
beat
up
a
homosexu
he
should
get
charg
for
assault
and
batteri
whi
must
we
add
gay
bash
to
the
list
isnt
thi
a
sort
of
doubl
jeopardi
or
am
i
just
be
a
fascist
again
to
deter
an
epidem
of
gay
bash
that
ha
not
been
deter
by
assault
law
so
we
ought
to
make
beat
up
a
homosexu
more
illeg
than
beat
up
a
straight
and
who
advoc
that
hate
crime
law
are
aim
at
the
motiv
of
the
act
just
like
premedit
homicid
is
treat
stricter
than
heatofpass
homicid
but
you
still
get
into
troubl
for
exampl
how
often
are
crime
of
violenc
not
hate
crime
the
question
is
then
who
are
you
hate
if
it
anoth
gang
member
then
it
better
than
if
the
person
you
hate
is
of
a
differnt
color
also
is
it
realist
to
declar
that
crime
of
hate
are
wors
than
crime
of
gross
neglig
like
random
drive
by
shoot
where
they
cant
be
hate
crime
becaus
the
shooter
doesnt
know
who
he
is
go
to
hit
he
just
shoot
into
the
crowd
no
it
is
not
doubl
jeopardi
a
singl
act
may
lead
to
multipl
charg
and
multipl
crime
i
think
what
you
meant
to
say
here
wa
with
the
current
mutat
of
the
u
constitut
under
the
current
polic
state
someon
may
be
charg
multipl
time
for
one
act
if
the
victim
in
question
is
of
the
right
shade
a
singl
act
should
never
merit
more
than
on
charg
so
if
i
set
off
a
bomb
in
the
world
trade
center
i
can
onli
be
charg
with
more
than
one
murder
and
not
the
other
five
death
and
extens
properti
damag
after
all
the
bomb
wa
a
singl
act
first
i
heard
today
that
there
is
a
good

that
the

such
a
