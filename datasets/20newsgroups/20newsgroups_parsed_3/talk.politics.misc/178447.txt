off

could
you
answer
the
question
pose
if
your
statement
is
so
beign
you
should
have
no
troubl
polit
respond
to
a
polit
queri
well
i
dont
think
your
queri
wa
exactli
polit
but
i
will
tri
to
give
you
a
polit
responc
someth
atyp
of
the
net
but
here
it
go
black
is
a
descript
adject
that
describ
mr
king
from
mani
of
the
newspap
radio
and
tv
news
report
i
have
seen
thi
adject
is
commonli
in
front
of
hi
name
i
have
never
seen
anyon
complain
about
the
use
of
thi
adject
when
use
in
a
benign
manner
i
did
not
say
that
mr
king
wa
a
no
good
black
i
do
not
know
mr
king
and
would
not
make
thi
ascertian
without
some
evid
to
thi
effect
i
use
it
pure
a
a
descript
adject
in
the
same
manner
than
mani
most
news
peopl
have
use
it
in
the
past
the
entir
second
trial
wa
about
race
ted
i
dont
feel
compel
to
discu
mr
king
racial
background
but
had
mr
king
been
white
there
would
not
have
been
a
second
trial
you
probabl
are
say
that
the
beat
would
not
have
occur
if
he
were
white
but
that
is
an
extrem
difficult
call
to
make
it
is
possibl
the
case
but
not
defin
i
still
think
your
action
are
crap
ted
they
are
far
more
divis
than
me
use
the
adject
black
in
a
nonderogenori
manner
would
you
have
been
happier
if
i
had
use
africanamerican
if
so
then
you
realli
are
lost
in
the
world
of
pc
you
have
alreadi
been
instrument
in
get
one
person
net
access
revok
and
i
wonder
if
you
have
sent
a
copi
of
my
messag
to
my
sy
admin
with
a
plea
that
i
am
not
worthi
of
post
the
way
you
went
about
thi
polit
inquiri
make
me
believ
it
wa
anyth
