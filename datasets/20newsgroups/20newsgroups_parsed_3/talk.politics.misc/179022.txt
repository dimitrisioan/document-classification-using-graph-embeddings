the
abil
to
take
the
leap
of

i
have
listen
to
sever
of
the

involv
in
thi
studi
and
even
they
claim
that
the
men
involv
will
not
tell
the
whole

i
put
littl
valu
in
extrapol
from
these
type
of
studi
or
survey
they
have
limit
subset
of
individu
and
there
is
alot
of
skew
due
to
improp
select

and
the
bia
of
the
peopl
involv
in
the

on
both

would
you
admit

would
you
admit
to
have
had

requir
thi

it
may
seem
harmless
and
silli

carri
a
larg

tag
i
hear
colleg
male

everyday
talk
about
their
suppos
conquest
they
just
have
to
look
good
to
one
anoth
at
least
in
their
eye
but
also
know
that
alot
of
thi
