the
other
q
sorri
can
you
describ
what
janet
reno
q
mr
presid
the
presid
ill
answer
both
your
question
but
i
cant
do
it
at
onc
q
can
you
describ
what
she
told
you
on
sunday
about
the
natur
of
the
oper
and
how
much
detail
you
knew
about
it
the
presid
ye
i
wa
told
by
the
attorney
gener
that
the
fbi
strongli
felt
that
the
time
had
come
to
take
anoth
step
in
tri
to
dislodg
the
peopl
in
the
compound
and
she
describ
gener
what
the
oper
would
be
that
they
want
to
go
in
and
use
tear
ga
which
had
been
test
not
to
caus
perman
damag
to
adult
or
to
child
but
which
would
make
it
veri
difficult
for
peopl
to
stay
insid
the
build
and
it
wa
hope
that
the
tear
ga
would
permit
them
to
come
outsid
i
wa
further
told
that
under
no
circumst
would
our
peopl

shot
at
them
even
if
fire
upon
they
were
go
to
shoot
the
tear
ga
from
armor
vehicl
which
would
protect
them
and
there
would
be
no
exchang
of
fire
in
fact
a
you
know
an
aw
lot
of
shot
were
fire
by
the
cult
member
at
the
feder
offici
there
were
no
shot
come
back
from
the
govern
side
i
ask
a
number
of
question
the
first
question
i
ask
is
whi
now
we
have
wait
seven
week
whi
now
the
reason
i
wa
given
were
the
follow
number
one
that
there
wa
a
limit
to
how
long
the
feder
author
could
maintain
with
their
limit
resourc
the
qualiti
and
intens
of
coverag
by
expert
there
they
might
be
need
in
other
part
of
the
countri
number
two
that
the
peopl
who
had
review
thi
had
never
seen
a
case
quit
like
thi
one
befor
and
they
were
convinc
that
no
progress
had
been
made
recent
and
no
progress
wa
go
to
be
made
through
the
normal
mean
of
get
koresh
and
the
other
cult
member
to
come
out
number
three
that
the
danger
of
their
do
someth
to
themselv
or
to
other
wa
like
to
increas
not
decreas
with
the
passag
of
time
and
number
four
that
they
had
reason
to
believ
that
the
child
who
were
still
insid
the
compound
were
be
abus
significantli
a
well
a
be
forc
to
live
in
unsanitari
and
unsaf
condit
so
for
those
reason
they
want
to
move
at
that
time
the
second
question
i
ask
the
attorney
gener
is
whether
they
had
given
consider
to
all
of
the
thing
that
could
go
wrong
and
evalu
them
against
what
might
happen
that
wa
good
she
said
that
the
fbi
personnel
on
the
scene
and
those
work
with
them
were
convinc
that
the
chanc
of
bad
thing
happen
would
onli
increas
with
the
passag
of
time
the
third
question
i
ask
wa
ha
the
militari
been
consult
a
soon
a
the
initi
tragedi
came
to
light
in
waco
that
the
first
thing
i
ask
to
be
done
becaus
it
wa
obviou
that
thi
wa
not
a
typic
law
enforc
situat
militari
peopl
were
then
brought
in
help
to
analyz
the
situat
and
some
of
the
problem
that
were
present
by
it
and
so
i
ask
if
the
militari
had
been
consult
the
attorney
gener
said
that
they
had
and
that
they
were
in
basic
agreement
that
there
wa
onli
one
minor
tactic
differ
of
opinion
between
the
fbi
and
the
militari
someth
that
both
side
thought
wa
not
of
overwhelm
signific
have
ask
those
question
and
gotten
those
answer
i
said
that
if
she
thought
it
wa
the
right
thing
to
do
that
she
should
proceed
and
that
i
would
support
it
and
i
stand
by
that
today
q
mr
presid
the
presid
wait
go
ahead
q
can
you
address
the
widespread
percept
report
wide
televis
radio
and
newspap
that
you
were
tri
somehow
to
distanc
yourself
from
thi
disast
the
presid
no
im
bewild
by
it
the
onli
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
let
me
say
the
onli
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
is
that
i
had
noth
to
add
to
what
wa
be
said
and
i
liter
did
not
know
until
rather
late
in
the
day
whether
anybodi
wa
still
aliv
other
than
those
who
had
been
actual
seen
and
taken
to
the
hospit
or
taken
into
custodi
it
wa
pure
and
simpli
a
question
of
wait
for
event
to
unfold
there
wa
i
have
i
cant
account
for
whi
peopl
specul
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
talk
to
the
attorney
gener
on
the
day
befor
the
action
took
place
i
talk
to
her
yesterday
i
call
her
again
late
last
night
after
she
appear
on
the
larri
king
show
and
i
talk
to
her
again
thi
morn
a
presid
it
is
not
possibl
for
a
presid
to
distanc
himself
from
thing
that
happen
when
the
feder
govern
is
in
control
i
will
say
thi
howev
i
wa
frankli
surpris
would
be
a
mild
word
to
say
that
anyon
that
would
suggest
that
the
attorney
gener
should
resign
becaus
some
religi
fanat
murder
themselv
applaus
i
regret
what
happen
but
it
is
not
possibl
in
thi
life
to
control
the
behavior
of
other
in
everi
circumst
these
peopl
kill
four
feder
offici
in
the
line
of
duti
they
were
heavili
arm
they
fire
on
feder
offici
yesterday
repeatedli
and
they
were
never
fire
back
on
we
did
everyth
we
could
to
avoid
the
loss
of
life
they
made
the
decis
to
immol
themselv
and
i
regret
it
terribl
and
i
feel
aw
about
the
child
but
in
the
end
the
last
comment
i
had
from
janet
reno
is
when
and
i
talk
to
her
on
sunday
i
said
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
onc
more
whi
you
believ
not
whi
they
believ
whi
you
believ
we
should
move
now
rather
than
wait
some
more
and
she
said
it
becaus
of
the
child
they
have
evid
that
those
child
are
still
be
abus
and
that
theyr
in
increasingli
unsaf
condit
and
that
they
dont
think
it
will
get
ani
easier
with
time
with
the
passag
of
time
i
have
to
take
their
word
for
that
so
that
is
where
i
think
thing
stand
q
can
we
assum
then
that
you
dont
think
thi
wa
mishandl
in
view
of
the
outcom
that
you
didnt
run
out
of
patienc
and
if
you
had
it
to
do
over
again
would
you
realli
decid
that
way
the
presid
no
well
i
think
what
you
can
assum
is
just
exactli
what
i
announc
today
thi
is
a
the
fbi
ha
done
a
lot
of
thing
right
for
thi
countri
over
a
long
period
of
time
thi
is
the
same
fbi
that
found
the
peopl
that
bomb
the
world
trade
center
in
licketysplit
record
time
we
want
an
inquiri
to
analyz
the
step
along
the
way
is
there
someth
el
we
should
have
known
is
there
some
other
question
they
should
have
ask
is
there
some
other
question
i
should
have
ask
can
i
say
for
sure
that
no
one
that
we
could
have
done
noth
el
to
make
the
outcom
come
differ
i
dont
know
that
that
whi
i
want
the
inquiri
and
that
whi
i
would
like
to
make
sure
that
we
have
some
independ
law
enforc
peopl
not
polit
peopl
but
total
nonpolit
outsid
expert
who
can
bring
to
bear
the
best
evid
we
have
there
is
unfortun
a
rise
in
thi
sort
of
fanatic
all
across
the
world
and
we
may
have
to
confront
it
again
and
i
want
to
know
whether
there
is
anyth
we
can
do
particularli
when
there
are
child
involv
but
i
do
think
it
is
import
to
recogn
that
the
wrongdoer
in
thi
case
were
the
peopl
who
kill
other
and
then
kill
themselv
q
mr
presid
were
there
ani
other
option
present
to
you
for
resolv
thi
situat
at
ani
point
from
februari
th
until
yesterday
the
presid
well
ye
i
got
regular
report
all
along
the
way
there
were
lot
of
other
option
pursu
if
you
go
back
you
all
cover
it
veri
well
the
fbi
you
did
a
veri
good
job
of
it
i
mean
the
fbi
and
the
other
author
there
pursu
ani
number
of
other
option
all
along
the
way
and
a
lot
of
them
earli
on
seem
to
be
work
some
of
the
child
got
out
some
of
the
other
peopl
left
there
wa
a
at
one
point
there
seem
to
be
some
line
of
commun
open
up
between
koresh
and
the
author
and
then
he
would
say
thing
and
not
do
them
and
thing
just
began
to
spin
downward
whether
there
were
other
in
term
of
what
happen
yesterday
the
convers
i
had
with
the
attorney
gener
did
not
involv
other
option
except
whether
we
should
take
more
time
with
the
present
strategi
we
were
pursu
becaus
they
said
they
want
to
do
thi
becaus
they
thought
thi
wa
the
best
way
to
get
peopl
out
of
the
compound
quickli
befor
they
could
kill
themselv
that
what
they
thought
q
did
the
govern
know
that
the
child
did
not
have
ga
mask
q
congression
hear
onc
the
situat
are
you
in
agreement
with
that
the
presid
that
up
to
the
congress
they
can
do
whatev
they
want
but
i
think
it
veri
import
that
the
treasuri
and
justic
depart
launch
thi
investig
and
bring
in
some
outsid
expert
and
a
i
said
in
my
statement
if
ani
congression
committe
want
to
look
into
it
we
will
fulli
cooper
there
is
noth
to
hide
here
thi
wa
probabl
the
most
wellcov
oper
of
it
kind
in
the
histori
of
the
countri
go
ahead
sarah
q
there
are
two
question
i
want
to
ask
you
the
first
is
i
think
that
they
knew
veri
well
that
the
child
did
not
have
ga
mask
while
the
adult
did
so
the
child
had
no
chanc
becaus
thi
ga
wa
veri
she
said
it
wa
not
lethal
but
it
wa
veri
danger
to
the
child
and
they
could
not
have
surviv
without
ga
mask
and
on
februari
th
let
go
back
didnt
those
peopl
have
a
right
to
practic
their
religion
the
presid
they
were
not
just
practic
their
religion
they
were
the
treasuri
depart
believ
that
they
had
violat
feder
law
ani
number
of
them
q
what
feder
law
the
presid
let
me
go
back
and
answer
i
cant
answer
the
question
about
the
ga
mask
except
to
tell
you
that
the
whole
purpos
of
use
the
tear
ga
wa
that
it
had
been
test
they
were
convinc
that
it
wouldnt
kill
either
a
child
or
an
adult
but
it
would
forc
anybodi
that
breath
it
to
run
outsid
and
one
of
the
thing
that
ive
heard
i
dont
want
to
get
into
the
detail
of
thi
becaus
i
dont
know
but
one
of
the
thing
that
they
were
specul
about
today
wa
that
the
wind
wa
blow
so
fast
that
the
window
might
have
been
open
and
some
of
the
ga
might
have
escap
and
that
may
be
whi
it
didnt
have
the
desir
effect
they
also
knew
sarah
that
there
wa
an
underground
compound
a
bu
buri
underground
where
the
child
could
be
sent
and
they
were
i
think
they
were
hope
veri
much
that
if
the
child
were
not
releas
immedi
outsid
that
the
human
thing
would
be
done
and
that
the
child
would
be
sent
someplac
where
they
could
be
protect
in
term
of
the
ga
mask
themselv
i
learn
yesterday
i
did

possibl
of

mass
suicid
and
when

about
the
actual
fire
and
explos
what
went
through
your

horrend
moment
the
presid
what
i

of

the
whole
issu
of

had
been
rais
in
the
public
he
had
that
had
been
debat
anyway
and
she
said
that
the
peopl
who
were
most
knowledg
about
these
kind
of
issu
conclud
that
there
