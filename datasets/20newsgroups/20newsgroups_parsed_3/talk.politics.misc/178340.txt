limit
govt
the
problem
libertarian
face
is
insur
that
the
limit
govern
they
seek
doe
not
becom
the
tool
of
privat
interest
to
pursu
their
own
agenda
believ
it
or
not
we
liber
are
frequent
a
oppos
to
anticompetit
measur
a
you
conserv
we
dont
believ
howev
that
competit
will
necessarili
be
protect
by
the
action
of
busi
interest
in
a
freemarket
after
all
in
the
exampl
you
cite
it
wa
not
liber
that
press
for
such
regul
but
good
staunch
conserv
businessmen
a
adam
smith
so
eloqu
demonstr
the
freemarket
is
not
someth
that
capitalist
seek
to
protect
when
they
can
profit
from
it
elimin
the
same
point
wa
made
by
marx
a
point
of
agreement
between
the
two
theorist
that
should
tell
u
someth
i
do
not
want
the
govern
to
becom
a
tool
of
privat
interest
limit
govern
can
not
insur
that
privat
interest
will
not
use
thi
govern
for
their
own
agenda
agre
but
thi
is
not
a
failur
of
libertarian
it
is
the
fact
that
utopia
is
not
an
option
there
is
no
singl
system
where
everyth
is
perfect
it
is
a
failur
of
libertarian
if
the
ideolog
doe
not
provid
ani
reason
way
to
restrain
such
action
other
than
utopian
dream
just
a
marxism
fail
to
specifi
how
pure
commun
is
to
be
achiev
and
the
state
is
to
wither
away
libertarian
frequent
fail
to
show
how
weaken
the
power
of
the
state
will
result
in
improv
in
the
human
condit
so
it
is
wise
to
look
for
the
best
solut
if
you
compar
countri
to
see
which
one
peopl
would
rather
live
in
which
one
have
le
starvat
hunger
poverti
and
miseri
you
will
find
that
they
have
a
more
limit
govern
than
countri
with
alot
of
poverti
miseri
and
suffer
no
limit
govern
can
not
insur
anyth
but
it
sure
is
better
than
the
altern
big
govern
thi
is
a
strawman
argument
and
fail
on
sever
ground
in
thi
case
limit
and
big
govern
are
not
defin
i
would
point
out
that
lebanon
somalia
and
the
former
yugoslavia
are
by
some
definit
nation
with
limit
govern
while
the
u
canada
and
nation
in
western
europ
where
peopl
would
rather
live
are
often
point
out
a
nation
with
big
govern
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limit
govern
and
those
who
want
unlimit
govern
it
is
between
those
who
believ
govern
regul
in
a
capitalist
economi
serf
worthwhil
end
and
those
who
believ
such
regul
is
neither
desir
on
empir
ground
nor
justifi
on
ideolog
ground
