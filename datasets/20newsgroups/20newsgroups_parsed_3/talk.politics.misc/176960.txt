a
seri
of
american
initi
to
support
econom
and
polit
reform
in
russia
and
it
valu
at
billion
befor
take
your
question
and
run
through
the
basic
outlin
of
thi
packag
i
want
to
make
a
few
point
first
thi
is
the
maximum
that
the
clinton
administr
can
do
with
avail
fund
to
support
russian
reform
all
of
the
fund
have
been
alloc
and
appropri
by
the
congress
there
is
no
need
for
the
administr
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
fund
ani
of
these
program
all
our
fiscal
year
fund
current
are
avail
so
in
effect
all
of
these
program
can
begin
tomorrow
the
second
point
is
that
thi
packag
is
design
to
support
russian
reform
all
of
the
initi
in
the
packag
are
direct
at
reform
and
for
their
benefit
and
all
have
been
work
out
with
prior
consult
with
the
russian
govern
third
the
presid
is
determin
that
we
will
deliv
on
these
commit
thi
year
the
packag
is
design
to
maxim
our
abil
to
support
reform
in
design
it
we
want
to
avoid
make
commit
that
we
could
not
meet
and
we
feel
veri
confid
that
we
can
meet
all
of
these
commit
in
front
of
you
fourth
id
like
to
note
the
special
import
of
trade
and
invest
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
russia
capit
and
technolog
need
throughout
the
next
decad
extend
well
into
the
hundr
of
billion
of
dollar
no
collect
of
govern
can
meet
those
need
onli
the
privat
sector
can
do
so
and
so
the
presid
and
presid
yeltsin
agre
to
make
trade
and
invest
a
major
prioriti
in
the
relationship
they
also
agre
that
there
would
be
a
new
joint
commiss
on
energi
and
space
form
head
on
the
u
side
by
vice
presid
gore
on
the
russian
side
by
prime
minist
chernomyrdin
and
the
goal
of
thi
effort
is
to
break
through
the
barrier
to
trade
and
invest
on
both
side
and
to
promot
a
vastli
expand
relationship
if
it
would
be
help
id
be
prepar
to
run
down
the
first
page
which
is
a
summari
of
u
assist
and
just
give
you
some
gener
background
on
what
these
program
are
ill
do
it
quickli
and
then
ill
be
glad
to
take
question
the
first
group
of
initi
are
humanitarian
food
and
medic
assist
thi
is
part
of
our
effort
which
ha
been
underway
for
sever
year
to
provid
basic
humanitarian
grant
food
assist
so
that
the
russian
govern
can
assur
there
at
least
a
minim
amount
of
bread
on
the
shelf
in
the
major
citi
that
million
in
grant
that
is
from
food
for
progress
the
grant
portion
of
food
for
progress
well
also
be
continu
our
grant
assist
in
medicin
and
pharmaceut
suppli
and
that
million
the
second
item
is
concession
food
sale
a
you
know
the
unit
state
ha
had
a
longterm
grain
relationship
with
russia
it
import
to
u
and
it
import
to
russia
that
we
continu
that
relationship
the
presid
ha
chosen
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
concession
loan
program
the
valu
over
the
next
seven
month
is
million
these
are
concession
term
the
exact
term
have
not
been
work
out
but
i
think
it
fair
to
say
there
will
be
a
grace
period
on
princip
of
six
or
seven
year
and
concession
rate
thereaft
for
the
life
of
the
deal
the
third
program
is
a
collect
of
privat
sector
support
we
think
thi
is
one
of
the
most
import
thing
were
go
to
do
privat
and
the
creation
of
small
busi
is
the
number
one
prioriti
of
the
reform
govern
in
moscow
and
so
the
presid
ha
decid
to
creat
a
russianamerican
enterpris
fund
capit
thi
year
at
million
and
the
goal
of
thi
fund
is
to
make
direct
loan
to
small
busi
in
russia
to
take
equiti
posit
in
those
busi
the
presid
ha
also
decid
to
creat
a
privat
fund
which
would
work
directli
with
the
russian
govern
in
it
prioriti
object
of
tri
to
convert
state
enterpris
from
a
stateown
basi
to
a
privat
basi
he
ha
also
agre
the
presid
ha
also
agre
to
establish
a
eurasia
foundat
thi
would
be
a
privat
foundat
led
by
promin
american
to
fund
democrat
project
in
russia
the
fourth
group
you
see
there
in
the
summari
page
is
democrat
itself
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
thi
administr
ha
given
a
new
impetu
to
the
goal
of
pursu
democrat
in
russia
you
see
that
we
have
a
total
of

program
variou
program
the
detail
tabl
give
an
indic
of
some
of
the

the
presid
is
also
call
for
the
develop
of
a
democraci
corp
which
will
be
an
overarch
umbrella
group
to
tri
to
incorpor
all
of
the
dispar
privat
and
public
effort
now
underway
from
the
unit
state
to
support
reform
in
russia
the
fifth
program
you
see
is
russian
offic
of
resettl
thi
is
a
new
initi
creat
and
conceptu
by
thi
administr
thi
is
a
demonstr
project
what
wed
like
to
do
is
work
with
the
russian
militari
to
help
resettl
russian
offic
return
from
the
baltic
state
and
other
part
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
work
out
the
best
way
to
do
that
whether
it
with
russian
labor
and
russian
materi
or
use
prefab
american
construct
and
so
weve
decid

demonstr
basi
the
construct
of

be
work
veri
close

goal
and
that
is
whi

there
by
april
th
which
is
the
open

of
the
tokyo
confer
the

befor
i
take
ani
further
question
id
like
to
defer
to
my
colleagu
who
will
review
the
secur
assist
object
with
you
senior
administr
offici
our
major
unfinish
agenda
with
the
russian
and
with
their
counterpart
in
ukrain
kazakhstan
and
belaru
is
in
the
area
of
the
safe
and
secur
dismantl
of
the
nuclear
arsen
on
their
territori
under
the
term
of
the
start
i
and
start
ii
agreement
recent
we
complet
in
moscow
three
i
think
veri
import
agreement
that
devot
a
signific
chunk
of
nunnlugar
fund
to
three
import
program
the
first
is
the
program
of
million
for
the
strateg
nuclear
deliveri
vehicl
dismantl
program
that
is
for
submarin
for
icbm
dismantl
and
for
bomber
dismantl
million
the
second
is
a
million
tranch
of
fund
for
the
construct
of
a
facil
to
store
nuclear
materi
remov
from
the
warhead
a
they
are
dismantl
thi
will
essenti
contribut
to
the
overal
design
and
the
earli
phase
of
the
construct
of
that
storag
facil
and
final
a
million
tranch
of
money
to
help
in
the
establish
of
a
monitor
system
for
the
nuclear
materi
a
they
are
withdrawn
from
the
weapon
system
so
we
add
that
million
total
to
the
extant
nunnlugar
assist
which
ha
been
flow
about
million
for
some
overal
safeti
improv
for
variou
kind
of
equip
and
safeti
measur
that
we
have
been
work
out
with
the
russian
over
the
last
coupl
of
year
so
thi
is
an
area
where
we
will
be
go
a
lot
more

with
not

the
russian

with
the

veri
hard
with

i
look
upon

a
a
veri
import
step
in
that
process
q
the
opic

is

and
conoco
alreadi

more
about

for

thing
one

two
to
tri
to
get
into
the
busi
of
renov
oil
well
and
renov
pipelin
both

the
object
here
obvious
is

increas
energi

the
russian
do
a
well
and
it
good
for
an
american
compani

the
american

play
a
lead
role

pull
thi
togeth
through
the
credit
facil
in

guarante
q
so
it
to
search
and
also
to
renov
field
that

alreadi
there
senior
administr
offici
that
right
q
on
that
point
should
other
american
compani
expect
to
get
administr
support
for
such
deal
or
should
they
now
go
to
the
exim
and
tri
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
billion
senior
administr
offici
well
a
you
know
exim
is
part
of
the
u
govern
and
variou
part
of
the
u
govern
have
been
push
includ
the
state
depart
and
the
white
hous
for
thi
deal
to
be
consumm
and
we
think
it
will
and
if
we
arriv
at
thi
agreement
by
april
th
there
will
be
billion
in
financ
avail
for
american
compani
to
sell
their

and
sell
their

q
that
should
take
up
all
of

their
wont
be

their
will
or
there
wont
be
support
for
opic
sort
of

such
a
thi
conoco
senior
administr
offici
there
a
tremend
amount
of
interest
on
the
part
of
american
oil
and
ga
compani
to
invest
in
russia
we
think
that
the
exim
oil
and
ga
facil
the
billion
facil
onc
it
is
conclud
will
soak
up
a
lot
of
that
interest
but
i
think
the
interest
may
even
extend
beyond
that
and
if
so
the
govern
will
respond
q
what
the
current
year
budget
cost
of
that
billion
agreement
should
it
go
forward
and
is
there
ani
current
year
budget
cost
senior
administr
offici
ill
have
to
refer
you
to
exim
for
that
i
dont
know
the
detail
of
that
q
the
concession
food
sale
is
there
ani
current
year
cost
to
that
or
is
it
delay
until
the
year
in
which
the
payment
are
due
senior
administr
offici
the
concession
food
sale
are
from
food
for
progress
which
is
a
usda
program
usda
ha
the
fund
we
dont
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
expend
those
fund
there
will
be
a
hit
in
the
budget
id
refer
you
to
usda
and
omb
for
the
detail
on
that
q
can
you
talk
about
the
democraci
corp
q
and
the
privat

how
mani
folk
are
go
to
be
involv
in
that
senior
administr
offici
whi
dont
i
start
with
the
democraci
corp
first
i
think
the
administr
felt
come
into
offic
that
there
were
liter
thousand
of
organ
privat
organ
in
the
unit
state
that
in
one
way
or
anoth
were
work
at
the
goal
of
tri
to
achiev
democrat
in
russia
help
on
a
farmertofarm
basi
and
there
were
liter
or
u
govern
agenc
that
had
a
varieti
of
program
in
thi
area
and
so
the
administr
felt
the
presid
felt
it
wa
import
to
tri
to
draw
all
of
these
initi
togeth
under
one
group
to
give
some
coher
to
the
effort
and
to
give
some
impetu
to
the
effort
and
so
thi
is
a
presidenti
initi
it
will
be
head
by
ambassador
tom
simon
who
will
soon
take
up
hi
duti
a
the
coordin
for

assist
in

former

union
and
were
veri
hope
that
we
might
use
thi
democraci
corp
not
onli
to
draw
upon
the
resourc
of
our
own
govern
but
the
resourc
of
the
american
privat

from
make
further
loan
for
food
becaus
of
russia
inabl
to
pay
how
doe
thi
fit
into
that
situat
senior
administr
offici
a
you
know
the
unit
state
for
a
long
time
ha
been
a
major
supplier
of
grain
and
food
commod
agricultur
product
to
russia
i
think
between
and
we
had
extend
a
littl
bit
of
histori
here
about
billion
in
credit
credit
guarante
through
the
commod
credit
corpor
that
wa
the
princip
vehicl
to
ensur
the
sale
of
american
grain
product
on
decemb
of
last
year
the
russian
govern
stop
it
payment
on
that
program
they
are
now
in
arrear
to
u
on
that
program
and
therefor
by
law
the
unit
state
can
not
continu
that
program
and
so
the
presid
work
with
secretari
espi
and
other
offici
in
the
cabinet
look
for
other
way
that
we
could
promot
american
grain
sale
and
i
think
we
have
two
way
to
do
that
weve
announc
today
million
in
grant
food
assist
through
the
food
for
progress
program
but
we
do
not
have
suffici
author
to
spend
million
in
grant
food
and
so
we
look
for
a
concession
loan
program
i
think
everybodi
agre
that
russia
that
a
shortterm
loan
program
for
russia
would
not
make
sens
now
but
a
longterm
concession
loan
program
would
and
that
is
what
thi
program
is
it
will
provid
onc
the
final
detail
are
work
out
for
a
six
to
sevenyear
grace
period
on
payment
of
princip
and
then
from
year
seven
through
which
is
the
life
of
the
deal
it
will
provid
for
concession
rate
of
interest
gener
around
three
to
four
percent
and
so
we
believ
and
the
russian
govern
belief
thi
is
a
good
deal
for
them
becaus
it
will
avoid
the
imper
of
earli
payment
and
put
them
into
the
out
year
but
it
will
also
continu
thi
veri
import
grain
relationship
which
is
import
for
them
and
it
import
for
the
american
farm
commun
q
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
thi
could
make
it
explicit
the
russian
failur
to
pay
the
interest
on
ecc
loan
doe
not
in
ani
way
affect
thi
kind
of
loan
go
through
is
that
right
senior
administr
offici
let
me
be
explicit
about
that
we
are
prevent
under
the
law
to
from
continu
the
commod
credit
corpor
shortterm
credit
program
becaus
of
russia
arrearag
to
the
unit
state
all
of
you
know
about
those
arrearag
they
total
about
i
think
around
million
usda
can
give
you
an
exact
figur
so
have
taken
that
into
consider
and
want
to
preserv
american
market
share
and
a
longterm
grain
relationship
want
to
respond
to
a
specif
request
from
the
russian
govern
for
major
food
assist
know
that
we
couldnt
take
it
from
the
grant
program
becaus
we
dont
have
suffici
author
there
we
look
at
food
for
progress
which
is
a
program
weve
use
to
great
effect
in
other
part
of
the
world
and
we
consult
with
the
russian
govern
and
arriv
at
thi
solut
i
think
the
russian
are
pleas
becaus
it
provid
them
with
the
food
but
also
give
them
a
littl
bit
of
relief
on
the
shortterm
payment
q
where
do
those
fund
actual
come
from
senior
administr
offici
they
come
from
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
program
under
usda
author
usda
ha
the
author
to
spend
these
fund
we
do
not
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
for
these
fund
and
i
want
to
make
that
gener
point
again
everyth
in
thi
packag
the
billion
packag
compris
fund
that
have
alreadi
been
alloc
and
appropri
by
the
congress
the
administr
can
begin
to
spend
these
moni
tomorrow
and
it
veri
import
in
our
eye
that
we
expend
all
the
fund
thi
year
that
we
meet
these
commit
and
we
are
confid
well
be
abl
to
do
so
q
how
did
you
arriv
at
the
figur
of
million
doe
that
max
out
that
program
or
did
you
actual
have
a
rang
from
to
senior
administr
offici
there
a
reason
for
it
the
reason
wa
that
the
russian
govern
told
u
that
about
the
amount
of
grain
that
they
need
between
now
and
harvest
time
and
so
the
idea
is
that
we
would
begin
the
shipment
probabl
million
per
month
from
now
until
the
harvest
in
the
autumn
at
which
time
russia
wont
requir
the
same
level
of
food
import
from
the
west
q
i
would
imagin
there
go
to
be
some
consider
envi
and
jealousi
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
other
republ
becaus
of
the
size
and
the
scope
of
thi
with
russia
have
you
given
ani
consider
to
advanc
negoti
for
the
same
kind
of
project
with
the
ukrain
with
georgia
with
some
of
the
other
republ
senior
administr
offici
ye
were
veri
conscienc
of
the
fact
that
we
also
have
an
interest
in
extend
american
support
to
the
other
countri
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
have
told
ourselv
and
we
have
plan
that
in
the
area
of
technic
assist
the
grant
technic
assist
that
you
see
roughli
percent
of
the
fund
will
go
to
russia
and
roughli
percent
to
the
other
countri
in
the
area
of
food
sale
we
have
been
activ
with
ukrain
in
grant
food
assist
with
georgia
and
armenia
we
will
continu
that
and
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
after
thi
summit
we
will
go
back
and
look
at
all
of
our
program
with
the
other
countri
to
ensur
that
they
are
adequ
and
they
are
product
and
theyr
hardhit
q
ha
anyth
happen
at
the

to
lead
american
energi
compani
and
other

to
believ
that
russia
is
go
to
be
more
userfriendli
toward
them
in
term
of
tax
legal
bureaucraci
senior
administr
offici
well
one
of
our
primari
object
come
into
thi
summit
wa
to
highlight
not
onli
the
econom
agenda
but
also
trade
and
invest
and
id
like
to
refer
to
the
point
i
made
at
the
begin
were
convinc
in
talk
about
thi
problem
the
problem
of
how
to
support
russia
longterm
were
convinc
that
no
collect
of
western
govern
have
the
financi
resourc
over
the
next
decad
to
fuel
the
continu
of
reform
that
onli
the
privat
sector
can
do
that
we
look
at
our
own
societi
and
we
see
tremend
capabl
in
resourc
in
the
oil
and
ga
sector
it
is
a
veri
good
match
with
what
the
russian
need
now
which
is
financi
invest
in
the
exist
oil
and
ga
well
and
pipelin
and
new
technolog
and
new
capit
to
financ
new
product
that
what
the
russian
govern
ha
told
u
it
want
to
do
and
so
that
whi
we
have
made
such
a
major
emphasi
on
it
that
whi
trade
and
invest
wa
a
promin
issu
on
the
first
day
of
these
talk
and
in
fact
figur
promin
last
night
in
the
meet
between
presid
yeltsin
and
presid
clinton
and
were
hope
that
togeth
we
might
send
a
strong
signal
to
the
american
busi
commun
that
we
support
their
effort
to
invest
in
russia
that
the
unit
state
through
ex
im
and
opec
and
the
depart
of
commerc
will
be
there
to
support
them
q
my
question
is
is
yeltsin
in
ani
posit
to
deliv
on
make
russia
a
more
senior
administr
offici
we
think
he
is
i
would
note
that
presid
yeltsin
prime
minist
mr
chernomyrdin
work
for

in
the
russian
oil
and
ga
sector
he
will
now
chair
a
highlevel
commiss
with
the
vice
presid
vice
presid
gore
to
tri
to
break
through
the
barrier
that
current
exist
to
western
invest
in
the
oil
and
ga
sector
we
believ
we
have
a
commit
to
make
that
committe
an
import
committe
and
were
look
forward
to
the
work
q
what
type
of
mechan
is
alreadi
in
place
to

the
privat
sector
portion
of

we
were
prepar

weve
look
at

but
were
not

to
make
a
quick
decis
thi
weekend
they
requir
let
me
just
explain
particularli
on
jacksonvanik
they
requir
consult
with
the
congress
they
requir
consult
with
the
american
jewish
commun
and
were
veri
sensit
to

concern
and
so
well
want

befor
we
take
ani
action
q
is
thi
packag
design
so
that
you
will
not
have
to
go
to

for
anyth
at
thi
point
senior
administr
offici
a
i
said
at
the
begin
the
advantag
of
thi
particular
packag
is
that
all
the
fund
have
been
alloc
and
appropri
by
the
congress
so
the
administr
will
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
seek
ani
addit
author
to
fund
ani
of
these
effort
in
effect
they
can
all
begin
tomorrow
and
i
know
that
mani
of
the
agenc
respons
for
these
project
will
begin
tomorrow
and
that
the
advantag
of
thi
particular
initi
q
if
thi
a
the
presid
say
is
a
longterm
longhaul
thing
and
member
of
congress
are
at
thi
moment
head
for
moscow
whi
arent
you
talk
about
go
to
congress
and
suggest
to
the
presid
of
russia
that
you
are
prepar
to
go
to
congress
for
variou
thing
senior
administr
offici
i
think
weve
been
clear
about
that
the
presid
is
discuss
thi
weekend
with
presid
yeltsin
some
addit
idea
that
we
have
for
american
fund
of
addit
project
and
idea
that
he
ha
we
have
a
major
congression
deleg
that
left
last
night
head
by
repres
gephardt
and
well
want
to
consult
with
that
deleg
and
other
member
of
congress
befor
do
anyth
and
well
also
want
to
consult
with
our
alli
so
that
where
it
stand
now
q
weve
been
told
repeatedli
that
a
number
of
these
item
repres
differ
or
new
way
of
spend
the
money
alreadi
appropri
could
you
just
tick
off
which
of
these
item
repres
reprogram
or
at
least
spend
money
in
way
that
it
wa
not
previous
set
to
be
senior
administr
offici
i
think
that
weve
said
that
these
are
all
project
that
either
congress
had
alloc
money
for
through
the
freedom
support
act
there
were
some
fund
that
were
left
over
from
fy
and
thi
administr
took
offic
and
had
some
new
idea
about
how
the
fund
might
be
expend
we
didnt
use
just
the
freedom
support
act
fund
or
the
fy
fund
we
went
into
some
of
the
agenc
alloc
exim
opic
and
usda
and
tri
to
look
for
creativ
way
to
further
our
program
and
exampl
of
that
is
the
food
for
progress
concession
loan
we
had
hit
a
brick
wall
with
anoth
type
of
fund
through
usda
we
could
not
go
forward
legal
and
so
we
look
for
a
more
creativ
way
to
ensur
continu
american
market
share
and
ensur
continu
grain
sale
and
we
think
we
found
it
q
where
for
exampl
are
you
get
the
money
for
thi
russian
offic
resettl
senior
administr
offici
that
from

and
for
ani
number
of
reason
were
not
abl
to
meet
them
were
determin
and
the
presid
is
determin
to
carri
out
everi
singl
program
in
thi
packag
and
well
do
it
but
we
do
have
a
longerterm
commit
and
that
part
of
the
discuss
on
econom
thi
weekend
were
look
for
russian
idea
on
what
it
is
we
can
do
to
most
effect
support
reform
and
weve
told
them
that
we
do
have
a
commit
on
some
of
these
program
beyond
thi
fiscal
year
q
taken
it
way
from
ani
senior
administr
offici
no
we
havent
okay
the
question
is
have
we
reprogram
ani
of
these
fund
so
have
we
taken
it
from
other
countri
to
pay
for
program
in
russia
the
answer
is
no
we
have
not
done
so
q
in
term
of
fund
there
is
no
avail
moni
left
and
you
simpli
find
a
creativ
way
to
find
money
somewher
els
doesnt
that
in
fact
support
the
theori
senior
administr
offici
not
at
all
i
dont
think
it
doe
that
a
particular
exampl
and
the
exampl
is
grain
sale
the
commod
credit
corpor
credit
guarante
program
wa
shortterm
loan
that
russia
had
to
pay
back
within
to
month
you
all
know
about
russia
debt
problem
and
russia
wa
unabl
to
meet
those
commit
so
we
look
for
a
way
to
do
two
thing
to
meet
russia
requir
for
grain
theyr
a
net
grain
import
on
a
massiv
scale
and
also
meet
our
object
of
make
sure
that
the
american
farmer
have
a
chanc
to
sell
their
product
to
russia
and
we
simpli
look
for
anoth
way
to
financ
that
and
we
have
legisl
author
to
do
it
thi
program
ha
been
success
in
other
area
we
had
not
tri
it
befor
in
the
former
soviet
union
but
we
thought
we
should
now
q
isnt
thi
realli
the
bushclinton
aid
packag
for
russia
sinc
these
fund
were
realli
first
deriv
by
initi
put
forward
by
presid
bush
senior
administr
offici
no
i
dont
think
that
a
fair
character
a
lot
of
these
fund
were
appropri
by
the
u
congress
is
in
thi
administr
took
offic
and
inherit
some
oblig
that
the
bush
administr
had
made
but
we
had
a
long
six
to
seven
week
review
of
thi
program
we
decid
to
meet
the
commit
that
had
been
made
by
the
previou
administr
but
we
have
gone
well
beyond
them
in
fund
the
enterpris
fund
which
wa
just
an
idea
but
the
idea
had
not
been
fill
out
with
a
program
there
wa
no
number
attach
to
it
in
group
togeth
some
project
and
tri
to
make
them
into
a
coher
whole
in
the
privat
effort
i
would
say
is
anoth
clinton
initi
further
we
listen
to
the
russian
govern
and
listen
to
the
russian
militari
who
told
u
that
the
resettl
of
their
offic
wa
import
to
them
for
polit
and
econom
and
social
reason
and
presid
clinton
ha
respond
to
that
and
we
are
make
a
longterm
commit
that
beyond
thi
demonstr
project
were
go
to
figur
out
a
way
to
do
much
more
in
tri
to
settl
those
offic
i
would
also
say
that
the
presid
ha
given
impetu
to
all
of
u
in
the
agenc
to
think
much
more
broadli
about
what
it
is
we
can
do
on
democrat
becaus
there
we
have
some
experi
and
some
compar
advantag
that
lend
itself
to
the
russian
experi
and
in
call
for
the
creation
of
a
democraci
corp
which
is
anoth
new
initi
were
hope
that
we
can
take
the
resourc
of
the
privat
sector
a
well
a
the
american
govern
to
achiev
that
object
so
i
would
not
character
it
that
way
at
all
and
a
most
of
you
know
i
am
a
career
civil
servant
i
wa
in
the
last
administr
im
veri
familiar
with
what
the
last
administr
did
and
i
would
character
thi
a
a
clinton
assist
packag
for
russia
q
there
been
a
lot
of
critic
that
aid
in
the
past
ha
not
gotten
to
the
peopl
is
there
anyth
in
thi
outsid
of
the
ombudsman
that
will
guarante
that
thi
money
will
not
just
disappear
becaus
it
be
administ
by
the
russian
govern
senior
administr
offici
i
think
that
i
know
that
the
presid
and
other
senior
offici
of
our
govern
are
concern
that
american
money
be
spent
wise
and
that
it
get
to
the
sourc
that
it
intend
for
which
it
intend
and
so
were
go
to
take
great
care
aid
and
the
state
depart
will
take
great
care
in
make
sure
that
the
fund
are
expend
properli
and
that
theyr
reach
their
sourc
i
would
not
that
thi
packag
is
not
simpli
a
packag
of
support
sole
to
the
russian
govern
some
of
these
project
especi
in
democrat
and
exchang
are
go
to
be
work
out
directli
with
russian
privat
individu
with
busi
the
privat
enterpris
support
is
anoth
exampl
of
that
senior
administr
offici
if
i
could
just
add
a
word
on
thi
point
with
regard
to
the
ssdrelat
program
one
area
that
weve
been
look
at
veri
veri
close
is
consider
of
actual
use
russian
firm
in
subcontract
for
these
kind
of
program
they
would
be
work
veri
close
of
cours
with
the
american
firm
who
would
be
the
prime
contractor
but
thi
is
a
fine
exampl
i
think
of
a
more
of
a
imagin
and
flexibl
approach
toward
get
some
of
that
fund
down
to
the
grassroot
level
down
to
the
ground
in
russia
but
at
the
same
time
ensur
that
it
is
spent
effici
and
for
the
purpos
for
which
it
wa
intend
q
when
would
the
democraci
corp
start
exactli
when
do
you
see
thi
happen
how
would
get
it
off
the
ground
senior
administr
offici
well
the
presid
is
today
call
for
the
creation
of
a
democraci
corp
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
were
go
to
work
out
it
framework
over
the
next
coupl
of
week
ambassador
simon
take
up
hi
duti
on
may
st
but
in
effect
weve
alreadi
start
becaus
over
the
last
coupl
of
week
the
administr
ha
begun
to
reach
out
to
peopl
in
the
privat
sector
who
have
come
to
u
ask
u
to
help
facilit
their
activ
in
russia
and
weve
said
that
we
will
be
help
weve
also
tri
to
kind
of
coordin
in
a
much
more
effect
way
the
activ
of
our
own
govern
we
do
have
or
agenc
that
are
activ
in
russia
in
one
way
or
anoth
we
think
it
make
sens
to
draw
them
togeth
and
to
focu
their
effort
q
excus
me
how
much
of
thi
billion
will
actual
be
spent
in
the
unit
state
by
american
made
good
senior
administr
offici
i
dont
have
ani
figur
for
you
now
but
perhap
we
could
tri
to
work
someth
up
in
the
next
coupl
of
day
on
that
q
thi
figur
is
larger
than
the
figur
that
ha
been
in
the
press
did
thi
program
grow
yesterday
a
a
result
of
the
discuss
or
have
we
just
been
that
far
off
the
mark
senior
administr
offici
no
i
think
unfortun
the
press
ha
been
a
littl
bit
off
the
mark
and
im
sorri
to
say
that
no
thi
packag
presid
clinton
put
u
to
work
about
seven
week
ago
on
thi
packag
and
he
wa
brief
intens
on
thi
he
contribut
a
lot
of
the
intellectu
leadership
in
thi
packag
he
contribut
a
lot
of
the
idea
in
the
packag
and
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
we
had
thi
rough
packag
work
out
about
two
week
ago
we
have
been
refin
it
ever
sinc
we
spent
a
coupl
of
day
last
week
go
over
it
with
the
russian
govern
both
the
embassi
in
washington
and
the
govern
in
moscow
through
our
own
embassi
and
so
it
been
evolv
but
thi
particular
packag
ha
been
togeth
for
about
two
week
q
where
is
yeltsin
input
into
thi
then
there
wa
so
much
talk
befor
about
the
presid
want
to
get
yeltsin
view
about
specif
what
wa
need
and
so
forth
is
that
in
the
out
year
senior
administr
offici
no
it
both
presid
yeltsin
ha
on
sever
occas
told
u
for
instanc
that
support
for
the
creation
of

busi
is
import
to
him
that
the
resettl
of
russian
militari
offic
is
import
and
that
first
and
foremost
the
effort
to
privat
the
state
industri
is
import
to
them
and
so
what
we
did
wa
to
tri
to
make
those
the
centerpiec
of
our
technic
assist
part
o
the
packag
we
listen
to
him
on
the
privat
effort
we
have
been
work
with
the
russian
govern
for
month
on
thi
tri
to
work
out
all
the
detail
so
the
russian
govern
on
most
of
these
program
wa
involv
everi
step
of
the
way
but
let
me
get
at
the
other
part
of
your
question
the
presid
is
also
use
thi
weekend
to
talk
about
a
broader
set
of
initi
that
we
might
undertak
and
were

for
hi
idea
the
presid
ha
brought
hi
own
idea
to
the
tabl
for
instanc
on
energi
and
the
environ
and
in
hous
but
were
look
for
russian
idea
not
we
need
to
consult
with
the
congress
and
we
need
to
consult
with
the
other
alli
govern
that
are
also
activ
q
there
essenti
noth
that
happen
in
the
last
day
and
a
half
that

the
packag
that
you
came
in
with
senior
administr
offici
thi
particular
packag
a
i
said

wa
readi
about
two
week
ago
we
have
sinc
then
consult
with
the
russian
govern
on
the
final
stage
of
it
develop
and
so
thi
weekend
weve
primarili
talk
about
futur
about
what
more
the
unit
state
and
other
western
countri
can
do
to
support
reform
in
russia
which
is
our
base
object
here
q
i
notic
that
you
that
money
appropri
to
train
banker
and
businessmen
and
offic
can
you
tell
me
what
about
job
train
for
worker
who
are
displac
by
privat
senior
administr
offici
your
right
we
have
a
program
to
train
russian
young
russian
in
bank
and
financi
servic
in
the
unit
state
part
of
the
hous
initi
it
not
just
to
build
hous
unit
it
to
retrain
russian
offic
who
are
retir
into
other
profess
q
money
for
job
train
for
worker
whose
job
are
disappear
becaus
of
privat
senior
administr
offici
we
have
not
yet
alloc
ani
money
for
that
q
whi
not
q
of
the
million
is
go
to
build
hous
unit
isnt
that
a
lot
of
money
per
unit
given
what
the
western
dollar
will
buy
in
the
former
soviet
union
senior
administr
offici
if
you
want
to
do
hous
the
right
way
it
not
just
the
build
the
framework
of
a
hous
youv
got
to
think
about
all
the
util
youv
got
to
think
about
the
purchas
of
land
youv
got
to
think
about
sewag
and
ga
and
electr
and
so
forth
and
it
also
retrain
it
not
enough
to
put
retir
an
offic
come
out
of
riga
or
tallin
or
vilniu
in
a
hous
in
western
russia
we
think
we
have
an
oblig
to
tri
to
retrain
those
offic
a
well
thi
is
respond
to
a
request
from
the
russian
govern
q
of
the
million
will
go
to
retrain
senior
administr
offici
that
right
q
are
you
talk
about
apart
build
or
singl
senior
administr
offici
were
talk
about
singl
individu
dwell
q
your
say
that
onli
famili
will
be
serv
by
thi
senior
administr
offici
what
i
want
to
i
thought
i
point
out
earlier
thi
is
a
demonstr
project
what
we
didnt
want
to
do
given
the
experi
that
the
german
and
the
turk
and
the
italian
have
had
in
build
hous
in
western
russian
we
did
not
want
to
leap
into
it
with
a
huge
amount
of
money
what
we
want
to
do
is
work
over
the
next
coupl
of
month
and
tri
to
figur
out
with
american
organ
in
the
privat
sector
the
best
way
to
get
thi
job
done
i
note
that
we
have
a
longterm
commit
to
that
and
so
i
would
expect
that
we
would
put
a
lot
more
money
into
thi
in
the
futur
but
we
want
to
do
it
wise
we
want
to
spend
the
money
wise
q
what
is
it
about
thi
program
that
convinc
you
that
it
will
protect
russia
reform
and
that
russia
will
be
in
a
posit
to
may
back
the
money
theyr
suppos
to
pay
back
especi
consid
their
other
debt
problem
senior
administr
offici
well
look
i
think
it
import
to
note
that
the
unit
state
on
it
own
doe
not
have
the
capabl
to
fuel
a
continu
of
russian
reform
it
got
to
be
a
collect
western
effort
and
were
look
to
our
alli
to
do
more
a
well
but
beyond
that
it
realli
what
the
russian
do
that
is
go
to
decid
the
fate
of
reform
we
can
simpli
play
a
role
and
we
feel
we
have
an
oblig
to
do
so
which
is
consist
with
our
nation
interest
q
did
the
presid
say
that
the
valu
of
the
u
contribut
wa
that
it
would
creat
secur
and
prosper
for
the
unit
state
so
what
is
it
about
thi
program
that
doe
thi
senior
administr
offici
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
fundament
object
of
our
polici
toward
russia
and
that
is
we
want
to
do
everyth
we
can
to
support
the
continu
of
reform
we
are
convinc
that
if
reform
stay
in
power
then
well
be
abl
to
continu
the
drawdown
of
nuclear
forc
foreign
polici
cooper
and
econom
interact
which
are
the
three
benefit
to
the
unit
state
from
reform
in
russia
so
it
not
a
simpl
question
you
cant
just
say
that
thi
program
is
the
answer
it
a
longterm
question
and
we
have
to
make
a
longterm
commit
to
it
q
and
then
on
the
question
of
russia
abil
to
repay
what
convinc
you
theyll
be
abl
to
pay
seven
to
year
from
now
senior
administr
offici
well
the
russian
govern
ha
made
a
commit
to
repay
and
what
were
hope
is
that
if
reform
continu
and
if
they
can
continu
to
improv
their
oil
and
ga
sector
and
earn
addit
hard
currenc
revenu
that
russia
will
be
in
a
posit
six
or
seven
year
from
now
to
pay
back
those
loan
q
substanti
governmenttogovern
loan
weve
ever
gotten
into
with
the
russian
senior
administr
offici
i
dont
want
to
answer
authorit
on
that
i
dont
go
back
or
year
on
thi
but
in
the
last
four
or
five
year
ye
it
is
becaus
the
previou
way
that
we
financ
grain
export
wa
realli
to
just
ensur
privat
bank
loan
thi
is
a
differ
type
of
effort
q
govern
loan
in
ani
other
sector
that
you
recal
i
know
it
wasnt
done
in
senior
administr

i
think
it
fair
to
say
thi
is
a
new
and
uniqu
