is
bad
brian

write
a
few
week
ago
i
found
out
about
some
of
the
polit
that
is
go
on
with
the
texa
bullet
train
and
wa
appal
at
some
of
the
appar
underhand
tactic
to
push
thi
thing
through
without
ani
public
say
whatsoev
so
i
wrote
up
a
short
editori
thing
and
post
it
hope
to
get
some
discus
i
suppos
editori
dont
do
it
here
so
now
i
am
ask
for
the
gener
opinion
of
the
net
about
the
propos
high
speed
train
what
do
you
think
i
person
think
it
is
a
stupid
idea
and
that
there
are
a
few
peopl
somewher
who
are
go
to
get
veri
rich
from
thi
deal
my
opinion
is
thi
in
a
societi
whose
economi
is
primarili
base
on
capit
the
role
of
govern
should
be
to
provid
those
good
and
servic
that
need
provid
for
the
gener
public
good
but
govern
should
suppli
those
necessari
good
and
servic
onli
when
it
is
imposs
for
a
privat
enterpris
or
individu
to
make
money
from
provid
them
i
agre
with
some
of
the
other
post
that
thi
train
probabl
can
not
make
money
and
will
reli
heavili
on
state
tax
dollar
the
question
i
think
then
becom
do
we
the
gener
public
need
the
train
i
certainli
do
not
nor
will
i
ever
need
thi
train
in
lubbock
texa
with
the
inexpens
air
travel
provid
between
dalla
and
houston
i
dont
think
peopl
in
dalla
or
houston
need
it
either
