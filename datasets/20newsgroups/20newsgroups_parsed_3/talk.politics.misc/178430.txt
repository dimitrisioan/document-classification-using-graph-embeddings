is
the

in
thi

well
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
poverti
is
imperfectli
relat
to
social

polit
instabl
while
econom
inequ
is
much
more
strongli

if

thi
typic

revolut
would
have
been
far
more
typic
befor

much
delet
gee
jim
if
youll
check
the
constitut
youll
find
in
order
to
promot
the
gener
welfaredo
ordain
and
establish
thi
constitut
im
surpris
you
miss
it
it
right
there
in
the
first
paragraph
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made
it
at
least
through
the
preambl
you
almost
got
it
right
and
it
wa
a
good
tri
but
you
should
follow
your
own
advic
the
preambl
to
the
constitut
doe
read
a
you
have
quot
but
let
u
not
forget
that
after
all
it
is
onli
the
preambl
it
is
not
a
bind
part
of
the
constitut
and
carri
no
weight
in
the
law
that
poor
tortur
paragraph
ha
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfortun
passag
in
the
english
languag
wit
the
legion
of
blowhard
like
yourself
who
think
those
vagu
floweri
phrase
are
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
do
you
realli
believ
that
a
politician
onli
ha
to
give
lip
servic
to
promot
the
gener
welfar
to
be
within
the
limit
of
the
constitut
sorri
buddi
but
some
other
blowhard
manag
to
includ
the
gener
welfar
in
anoth
portion
of
the
constitut
articl
i
section
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to

collect

pay
the

and
provid
for
the
common
defenc
and

welfar
of
the

i
guess
they
want
to
make
sure
everyon
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preambl
just
to
make
sure
youv
got
the
point
let
do
a
littl
experi
what
if
the
constitut
read
a
follow
preambl
we
the
peopl
to
promot
the
gener
welfar
do
ordain
and
establish
thi
constitut
for
the
unit
state
of
america
constitut
the
feder
govern
shall
have
one
function
and
one
function
onli
to
provid
for
the
defens
of
the
nation
but
a
note
abov
the
constitut
doesnt
say
that
doe
it
the
govern
would
not
then
have
two
function
defens
and
welfar
but
sinc
it
explicitli
includ
both
the
gener
welfar
and
defens
in
articl
i
section
i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
