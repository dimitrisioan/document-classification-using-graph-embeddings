and
that
is
the

beat
in
commun
all
across
our

chanc
of
abus
action
by

time
these
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
we

i
promis
in
my
campaign
that
id
do
everyth
i
could
to
put
anoth

the
core
of
the
job

job
bill
let
work
togeth
i
can
accept
a
reduc
packag
if
you
will
increas
your
commit
to
safe
street
i
do
not
accept
the
fact
that
we
should
reduc
our
commit
to
summer
job
or
to
build
our
infrastructur
or
to
do
those
other
thing
that
will
creat
real
and
last
prosper
for
our
peopl
i
have
done
my
part
now
to
end
the
gridlock
i
ask
you
to
do
your
i
want
now
to
give
the
peopl
who
are
here
with
me
on
the
platform
a
chanc
to
make
some
remark
and
to
be
heard
by
the
american
peopl
begin
with
janet
reno
the
distinguish
attorney
gener
q
mr
presid
can
you
tell
u
do
you
think
that
the
job
packag
could
be
put
in
further
jeopardi
by
controversi
over
the
suggest
of
a
vat
tax
at
thi
point
in
the
congression
dialogu
the
presid
not
at
all
i
think
it
should
have
they
wouldnt
have
ani
relationship
one
to
the
other
first
of
all
i
made
absolut
no
decis
on
that
you
should
know
that
there
a
lot
of
support
in
the
busi
commun
and
the
labor
commun
peopl
have
ask
u
to
consid
that
becaus
of
the
enorm
burden
of
the
present
system
on
mani
of
our
major
employ
particularli
mani
of
those
that
we
depend
upon
to
gener
job
and
to
carri
the
strength
of
thi
economi
but
i
have
made
absolut
no
decis
that
would
even
approach
that
on
that
or
ani
other
kind
of
gener
tax
q
do
you
person
believ
that
the
american
public
is
readi
to
pay
for
to
have
anoth
tax
to
pay
for
health
care
i
mean
apart
from
what
busi
and
labor
leader
have
said
the
presid
im
not
go
to
specul
on
that
i
will
say
thi
the
real
issu
is
how
quickli
we
can
recycl
the
benefit
of
all
the
save
to
cover
the
cost
i
mean
that
is
everyon
know
that
if
you
do
what
were
propos
to
do
if
you
streamlin
the
insur
system
if
you
fix
the
system
so
that
there
no
longer
an
enorm
econom
incent
to
overutil
or
overprovid
certain
servic
if
you
provid
primari
and
prevent
care
in
place
where
it
isnt
now
everi
singl
analysi
show
absolut
massiv
save
to
the
health
care
system
the
real
question
is
whether
you
can
transfer
those
save
to
cover
those
who
have
no
coverag
now
or
those
who
have
virtual
no
coverag
so
that
you
provid
peopl
the
secur
i
have
no
idea
the
poll
say
that
but
i
dont
know
all
i
know
is
the
poll
that
i
see
in
the
press
that
mani
of
you
have
commiss
they
say
overwhelmingli
the
american
peopl
want
the
secur
of
an
afford
health
care
system
but
i
dont
think
that
ha
anyth
to
do
with
thi
stimulu
and
it
certainli
shouldnt
have
peopl
want
a
job
first
and
foremost
they
want
that
more
than
anyth
el
q
now
that
youv
announc
your
willing
to
compromis
on
the
stimulu
packag
can
you
tell
u
what
part
of
your
packag
you
consid
vital
and
uncompromis
i
assum
summer
job
is
one
the
presid
i
want
the
summer
job
i
want
the
highway
program
and
i
want
the
polic
program
i
still
intend
let
me
say
thi
i
still
intend
to
fulli
and
aggress
push
the
crime
bill
which
did
not
pas
the
congress
last
year
thi
is
a
supplement
to
that
not
a
substitut
for
it
in
ani
way
but
i
think
we
need
to
do
that
i
think
we
need
the
ryan
white
fund
becaus
of
the
enorm
health
care
burden
to
the
commun
that
are
inordin
and
disproportion
affect
by
the
problem
of
care
for
peopl
with
aid
and
there
are
sever
other
thing
that
i
think
should
be
done
we
have
to
do
the
agricultur
depart
meat
inspector
the
safeti
of
the
public
depend
on
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
thing
that
i
dont
i
dont
think
ani
of
it
should
be
cut
but
i
have
given
senat
mitchel
and
senat
byrd
i
talk
to
them
and
senat
dole
call
me
yesterday
to
discus
thi
and
i
told
him
that
i
would
call
him
back
i
call
him
back
last
night
in
new
hampshir
and
we
discus
thi
and
i
basic
ask
them
to
talk
today
and
said
that
i
would
not
make
ani
statement
about
ani
specif
until
at
least
they
had
a
chanc
to
talk
to
see
whether
or
not
they
could
reach
some
accord
so
i
dont
want
to
be
ani
more
specif
than
i
have
been
alreadi
and
let
see
if
they
can
talk
it
out
q
when
you
talk
to
senat
dole
and
senat
mitchel
did
you
tell
them
about
your
increas
also
that
million
that
you
want
that
a
part
of
the
packag
the
presid
i
did
i
told
senat
i
left
word
for
senat
mitchel
last
night
about
it
when
i
talk
to
senat
dole
i
dont
rememb
for
sure
i
do
not
believ
i
mention
it
but
i
did
tell
him
that
i
wa
prepar
to
reduc
the
packag
and
i
want
to
break
the
gridlock
and
i
told
him
that

on
a
reformul
of
it
so
that
in
the
hope
that
it
would
becom
even
more
focus
on
job
and
the
kind
of
issu
that
i
thought
the
american
peopl
want
u
to
