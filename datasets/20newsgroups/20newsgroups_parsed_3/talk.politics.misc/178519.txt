in

the

and
is
far
from

bodi
my
read
of

give
me
absolut
no
reason
to
believ
the

wasnt
intend
to
make
use
of

gridlock
appear
to
have
been

a
a
check
on
the

elect
hous
the
system
is
meant
to
be
slow
to
react
the
problem
is
that
it
end
up
a
bit
too
slow
on
what
basi
do
you
suggest
that
the
senat
wa
suppos
to
be
some
sort
of
rubberstamp
for
the

youll
note
that
while
the
presid
veto
may
be
overridden
the
hous
cant
do
anyth
about
a

by
the
