chri

write
so
we
tri
to
ensur
that
the
process
of
decid
whether
to
introduc
third
parti
isnt
random
a
steve
said
abov
there
are
exampl
where
third
parti
are
le
ignor
or
corrupt
than
the
two
primari
parti
should
thi
knowledg
not
be
abl
to
help
of
cours
it
help
but
onli
if
the
decis
to
involv
third
parti
is
the
primari
parti
to
make
a
corrupt
and
ignor
third
parti
isnt
go
to
say
were
corrupt
and
ignor
well
stay
out
of
thi
point
out
that
they
are
corrupt
and
ignor
wont
help
they
either
wont
believ
you
or
wont
care
it
imposs
or
at
least
beyond
my
abil
to
formul
a
rule
that
will
alway
tell
whether
the
involv
of
a
third
parti
would
be
good
or
bad
but
there
one
that
seem
better
than
ani
other
ive
ever
heard
suggest
voluntari
good
mandatori
bad
that
is
a
third
parti
should
involv
itself
in
a
transact
onli
at
the
request
of
the
primari
particip
so
we
dont
formul
a
rule
that
will
alway
tell
we
tri
to
use
knowledg
about
other
properti
of
situat
to
some
of
u
it
appear
that
tri
alway
to
appli
voluntari
good
mandatori
bad
is
not
onli
le
than
optim
it
is
in
some
circumst
serious
damag
the
interest
question
is
to
character
those
circumst
a
best
we
can
look
somebodi
ha
to
have
the
power
to
decid
whether
a
third
parti
will
regul
your
transact
or
not
that
somebodi
is
go
to
be
either
you
or
the
third
parti
you
can
argu
until
you
are
blue
in
the
face
that
regul
shouldnt
get
involv
in
fact
peopl
have
tri
thi
they
wont
listen
the
fundament
question
you
have
to
ask
is
whose
decis
is
it
whether
or
not
to
involv
regul
our
or
their
after
youv
answer
thed
first
question
you
can
tri
to
move
on

such
question
a

be
involv
and
if
so
what
