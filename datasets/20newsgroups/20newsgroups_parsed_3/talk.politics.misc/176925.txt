the

rate
of

show
that
they

year

and
sinc
the
percentag
of
black
in
thi
rang
is
higher
than
in

group
then
it
follow
statist
that
more
black
in

is
an
expect

note
that
i
havent

im
sure
thi
ha
to
have
an

on
the

overrepresent
of
black
in

black
have
the
same
crime
report
rate
arrest
rate
and
incarcer
rate
for
violent

so
i
doubt
that
for

that
there

there
is
a
wider
discrep
for
all

for

wrt
to
categori

enough
the
discrep
is
the
largest
in
the
southern
unit

where
black
are
incarcer
well
below
the
averag
in
the
rest
of
