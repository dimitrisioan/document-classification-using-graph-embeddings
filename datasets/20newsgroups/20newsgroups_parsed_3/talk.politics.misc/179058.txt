more
than
a
week

too
let
look
at
the
last
three
month
sinc
i
becam
presid
i
have
work
with
our
alli
and
we
have
tri
to
move
forward
first
on
the
nofli
zone
on
enforc
of
it
on
the
humanitarian
airdrop
on
the
war
crime
investig
on
get
the
bosnian
muslim
involv
in
the
peac
process
we
have
made
some
progress
and
now
we
have
a
veri
much
tougher
sanction
resolut
and
leon
fuerth
who
is
the
nation
secur
advisor
to
the
vice
presid
is
in
europ
now
work
on
implement
that
that
is
go
to
make
a
big
differ
to
serbia
and
we
are
review
other
option
i
think
we
should
act
we
should
lead
the
unit
state
should
lead
we
have
led
for
the
last
three
month
we
have
move
the
coalit
and
to
be
fair
our
alli
in
europ
have
been
will
to
do
their
part
and
they
have
troop
on
the
ground
there
but
i
do
not
think
we
should
act
alon
unilater
nor
do
i
think
we
will
have
to
and
in
the
next
sever
day
i
think
we
will
final
the
extens
review
which
ha
been
go
on
and
which
ha
taken
a
lot
of
my
time
a
well
a
the
time
of
the
administr
a
it
should
have
over
the
last
day
or
so
i
think
well
finish
that
in
the
near
futur
and
then
well
have
a
polici
and
well
announc
it
and
everybodi
can
evalu
it
q
can
i
follow
up
the
presid
sure
q
do
you
see
ani
parallel
between
the
ethnic
cleans
in
bosnia
and
the
holocaust
the
presid
i
think
the
holocaust
is
on
a
whole
differ
level
i
think
it
is
without
preced
or
peer
in
human
histori
on
the
other
hand
ethnic
cleans
is
the
kind
of
inhuman
that
the
holocaust
took
to
the
nth
degre
the
idea
of
move
peopl
around
and
abus
them
and
often
kill
them
sole
becaus
of
their
ethnic
is
an
abhorr
thing
and
it
is
especi
troublesom
in
that
area
where
peopl
of
differ
ethnic
group
live
side
by
side
for
so
long
togeth
and
i
think
you
have
to
stand
up
against
it
i
think
it
wrong
we
were
talk
today
about
all
of
the
other
troubl
in
that
region
i
wa
happi
to
see
the
violenc
between
the
croat
and
the
muslim
in
bosnia
subsid
thi
morn
and
i
think
were
make
progress
on
that
front
but
what
go
on
with
the
serbian
and
the
ethnic
cleans
is
qualit
differ
than
the
other
conflict
both
within
the
former
yugoslavia
and
in
other
part
of
the
region
q
mr
presid
by
ani
count
you
have
not
had
a
good
week
in
your
presid
the
tragedi
in
waco
the
defeat
of
your
stimulu
bill
the
standoff
in
bosnia
what
did
you
do
wrong
and
what
are
you
go
to
do
differ
how
do
you
look
at
thing
are
you
reassess
laughter
the
presid
i
dont
realli
believ
that
the
situat
in
bosnia
it
not
been
a
good
week
for
the
world
but
i
dont
know
that
the
administr
could
have
made
it
differ
on
the
stimulu
packag
id
like
to
put
it
into
the
larger
context
and
remind
you
that
in
thi
day
we
have
alreadi
fundament
chang
the
direct
of
an
american
govern
we
have
abandon
trickledown
econom
weve
abandon
the
polici
that
brought
the
debt
of
thi
countri
from
trillion
to
trillion
in
onli
a
decad
the
budget
plan
which
pass
the
congress
which
will
reduc
the
deficit
and
increas
invest
ha
led
to
a
year
low
in
mortgag
rate
dramat
lower
interest
rate
there
are
probabl
peopl
in
thi
room
who
have
refinanc
their
home
mortgag
in
the
last
three
month
or
who
have
had
access
to
cheaper
credit
that
go
to
put
ten
of
billion
dollar
cours
throughout
thi
economi
in
way
that
are
veri
veri
good
for
the
countri
and
so
we
are
move
in
the
right
direct
econom
i
regret
that
the
stimulu
did
not
pa
and
i
have
begun
to
ask
and
will
continu
to
ask
not
onli
peopl
in
the
administr
but
peopl
in
the
congress
whether
there
is
someth
i
could
have
done
differ
to
pa
that
part
of
the
reason
it
didnt
pa
wa
polit
part
of
it
wa
a
differ
in
idea
there
are
realli
peopl
still
who
believ
that
it
not
need
i
just
disagre
with
that
i
think
the
recoveri
the
economist
say
it
been
underway
for
about
two
year
and
weve
still
had
month
of
seven
percent
unemploy
and
all
the
wealthi
countri
are
have
troubl
creat
job
so
i
think
there
wa
an
idea
base
an
argument
there
that
while
were
wait
for
the
lower
interest
rate
and
the
deficit
reduct
and
the
invest
of
the
next
four
year
to
take
effect
thi
sort
of
supplement
appropri
should
go
forward
now
i
have
to
tell
you
i
did
misgaug
that
becaus
a
major
of
the
republican
senat
now
sit
in
the
senat
vote
for
a
similar
stimulu
when
ronald
reagan
wa
presid
in
and
vote
time
for
regular
supplement
appropri
like
thi
i
just
misgaug
it
and
i
hope
that
i
can
learn
someth
ive
just
been
here
day
and
you
know
i
wa
a
governor
work
with
a
contenti
legislatur
for
year
and
it
took
me
a
decad
to
get
polit
reform
there
so
it
take
time
to
chang
thing
but
i
basic
feel
veri
good
about
what
happen
in
the
first
day
with
regard
to
the
congress
q
waco
the
presid
well
with
regard
to
waco
i
dont
have
much
to
add
to
what
ive
alreadi
said
i
think
it
is
a
i
want
the
situat
look
into
i
want
u
to
bring
in
peopl
who
have
ani
insight
to
bear
on
that
i
think
it
veri
import
that
the
whole
thing
be
thoroughli
gone
over
but
i
still
maintain
what
i
said
from
the
begin
that
the
offend
there
wa
david
koresh
and
i
do
not
think
the
unit
state
govern
is
respons
for
the
fact
that
a
bunch
of
fanat
decid
to
kill
themselv
and
im
sorri
that
they
kill
their
child
q
mr
presid
to
follow
up
partli
on
helen
on
your
stimulu
packag
and
on
your
polit
approach
to
capitol
hill
ross
perot
said
today
that
your
play
game
with
the
american
peopl
in
your
tax
polici
he
wa
strongli
critic
of
your
stimulu
packag
he
said
he
go
to
launch
an
advertis
campaign
against
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
how
are
you
go
to
handl
hi
polit
critic
will
it
complic
your
effort
on
the
hill
with
your
econom
plan
and
do
you
plan
to
repackag
some
of
the
thing
that
have
been
in
your
stimulu
program
and
tri
to
resubmit
them
to
the
hill
the
presid
let
me
answer
that
question
first
were
go
to
revisit
all
of
that
over
the
next
few
day
im
go
to
be
talk
to
member
of
congress
and
to
other
to
see
what
we
can
do
about
that
with
regard
to
the
econom
plan
i
must
say
i
found
that
rather
amaz
i
dont
want
to
get
into
an
argument
with
mr
perot
ill
be
interest
to
hear
what
hi
specif
are
but
i
would
go
back
and
read
hi
book
and
hi
plan
there
a
remark
converg
except
that
we
have
more
specif
budget
cut
we
rais
tax
le
on
the
middl
class
and
more
on
the
wealthi
but
otherwis
the
plan
are
remark
similar
so
i
think
it
would
be
ill
be
interest
to
see
if
mayb
perhap
he
chang
hi
posit
from
hi
book
last
year
and
he
ha
some
new
idea
to
bring
to
bear
ill
be
glad
to
hear
them
q
to
follow
up
sir
how
do
you
plan
to
handl
hi
polit
critic
he
launch
a
campaign
against
you
do
you
think
you
can
sit
back
and
just
the
presid
well
first
of
all
i
will
ask
you
to
appli
the
same
level
of
scrutini
to
him
a
you
do
to
me
and
if
he
chang
hi
posit
from
the
posit
he
took
in
the
campaign
last
year
then
we
need
to
know
whi
and
what
hi
idea
are
mayb
he
got
some
construct
idea
i
think
the
american
peopl
have
shown
that
theyr
veri
impati
with
peopl
who
dont
want
to
produc
result
and
the
one
thing
i
think
that
everybodi
ha
figur
out
about
me
in
the
last
even
if
they
dont
agre
with
what
i
do
is
that
i
want
to
get
someth
done
i
just
came
here
to
tri
to
chang
thing
i
want
to
do
thing
and
i
want
to
do
thing
that
help
peopl
life
so
my
judgment
is
that
if
he
make
a
suggest
that
is
good
that
is
construct
that
take
u
beyond
some
idea
ive
propos
that
will
chang
peopl
life
for
the
better
fine
but
i
think
that
that
ought
to
be
the
test
that
we
appli
to
everyon
who
weigh
into
thi
debat
and
not
just
to
the
presid
q
mr
presid
to
go
back
to
bosnia
for
a
minut
you
continu
to
insist
that
thi
ha
to
be
multilater
action
a
criterion
that
seem
to
have
hamstrung
u
when
it
come
to
mani
option
thu
far
and
make
it
look
a
if
thi
is
a
state
of
paralysi
the
unit
state
is
the
last
remain
superpow
whi
is
it
not
appropri
in
thi
situat
for
the
unit
state
to
act
unilater
the
presid
well
the
unit
state
sure
you
would
agre
that
the
unit
state
even
a
the
last
remain
superpow
ha
to
act
consist
with
intern
law
under
some
mandat
of
the
unit
nation
q
but
you
have
a
mandat
and
the
presid
they
do
and
that
is
one
of
the
thing
that
we
have
under
review
i
havent
rule
out
ani
option
for
action
i
would
remind
all
of
you
i
have
not
rule
out
ani
option
except
that
we
have
not
discuss
and
we
are
not
consid
the
introduct
of
american
forc
into
continu
hostil
there
we
are
not
so
we
are
review
other
option
but
i
also
would
remind
you
that
to
be
fair
our
alli
have
had
the
french
the
british
and
the
canadian
have
had
troop
on
the
ground
there
they
have
been
justifi
worri
about
those
but
they
have
support
the
airdrop
the
toughen
of
the
sanction
they
welcom
the
american
deleg
now
in
europ
work
on
how
to
make
these
sanction
realli
work
and
realli
bite
against
serbia
and
i
can
tell
you
that
the
other
nation
involv
are
also
genuin
reassess
their
posit
and
i
would
not
rule
out
the
fact
that
we
can
reach
an
agreement
for
a
concert
action
that
go
beyond
where
we
have
been
i
dont
have
ani
critic
of
the
british
the
french
and
other
about
that
q
would
that
be
militari
action
q
mr
presid
sever
of

in
your

request
to
all
the
senior
member
of
my

to
let
me
know
what
they
thought

to
do
next
and
i
have
heard
from
her
and
from
other
about
what
they
think
we
ought
to
do
next
and
im
not
go
to
discu
the
recommend
they
made
to
me
but
in
the
next
few
day
when
i
make
a
decis
about
what
to
do
then
i
will
announc
what
im
go
to
do
so
i
wouldnt
say
that
either
one
of
those
exampl
qualifi
speak
out
of
school
q
how
about
the
valu
ad
tax
mr
presid
the
presid
what
wa
that
q
the
valu
ad
tax
mr
rivlin
and
miss
shalala
both
said
that
they
thought
that
that
wa
a
good
idea
the
presid
i
dont
mind
them
say
they
think
it
a
good
idea
there
are
all
kind
of
argument
for
it
on
polici
ground
that
doe
not
mean
that
we
have
decid
to
incorpor
it
in
the
health
care
debat
no
decis
ha
been
made
on
that
and
i
have
no
object
to
their
express
their
view
on
that
weve
had
a
lot
of
peopl
from
busi
and
labor
come
to
u
say
that
they
thought
that
tax
would
help
make
their
particular
industri
more
competit
in
the
global
economi
i
took
no
that
wasnt
take
a
line
against
an
administr
polici
q
mr
presid
a
week
ago
a
group
of
gay
and
lesbian
repres
came
out
of
a
meet
with
you
and
express
in
the
most
ring
term
their
confid
in
your
understand
of
them
and
their
polit
aspir
and
their
belief
that
you
would
fulfil
those
aspir
do
you
feel
now
that
you
will
be
abl
to
meet
their
now
enhanc
expect
the
presid
well
i
dont
know
about
that
and
i
dont
know
what
their
it
depend
on
what
the
expect
are
but
ill
tell
you
thi
i
believ
that
thi
countri
polici
should
be
heavili
bias
in
favor
of
nondiscrimin
i
believ
when
you
tell
peopl
they
cant
do
certain
thing
in
thi
countri
that
other
peopl
can
do
there
ought
to
be
an
overwhelm
and
compel
reason
for
it
i
believ
we
need
the
servic
of
all
of
our
peopl
and
i
have
said
that
consist
and
not
a
a
polit
proposit
the
first
time
thi
issu
came
up
wa
in
when
i
wa
in
boston
i
wa
just
ask
the
question
about
it
and
i
might
add
it
interest
that
i
have
been
attack
obvious
those
who
disagre
with
me
here
are
primarili
come
from
the
polit
right
in
america
when
i
wa
governor
i
wa
attack
from
the
other
direct
for
stick
up
for
the
right
of
religi
fundamentalist
to
run
their
child
care
center
and
to
practic
home
school
under
appropri
safeguard
i
just
have
alway
had
an
almost
libertarian
view
that
we
should
tri
to
protect
the
right
of
american
individu
citizen
to
live
up
to
the
fullest
of
their
capac
and
im
go
to
stick
right
with
that
q
are
you
concern
sir
that
you
may
have
gener
expect
on
their
end
and
critic
among
other
that
ha
hamstrung
your
administr
in
the
sens
of
far
too
great
emphasi
on
thi
issu
the
presid
ye
but
i
have
not
place
a
great
deal
of
emphasi
on
it
it
gotten
a
lot
of
emphasi
in
other
quarter
and
in
the
press
ive
just
simpli
taken
my
posit
and
tri
to
see
it
through
and
that
what
i
do
it
doesnt
take
a
lot
of
my
time
a
presid
to
say
what
i
believ
in
and
what
i
intend
to
do
and
that
what
ill
continu
to
do
q
mr
presid
get
back
to
the
situat
in
bosnia
and
we
understand
you
havent
made
ani
final
decis
on
new
option
previous
consid
unaccept
but
the
two
most
commonli
heard
option
would
be
lift
the
arm
embargo
to
enabl
the
bosnian
muslim
to
defend
themselv
and
to
initi
some
limit
air
strike
perhap
to
cut
off
suppli
line
without
tell
u
your
decis
presum
you
havent
made
ani
final
decis
on
those
two
option
what
are
the
pro
and
con
that
are
go
through
your
mind
right
now
and
will
weigh
heavili
on
your
final
decis
the
presid
im
reluct
to
get
into
thi
there
are
those
are
two
of
the
option
there
are
some
other
option
that
have
been
consid
all
have
plu
and
minu
all
have
support
and
oppon
within
the
administr
and
in
the
congress
where
i
would
remind
you
heavi
consult
will
be
requir
to
embark
on
ani
new
polici
i
do
believ
that
on
the
air
strike
issu
the
pronounc
that
gener
powel
ha
made
gener
about
militari
action
appli
there
if
you
take
action
if
the
unit
state
take
action
we
must
have
a
clearlydefin
object
that
can
be
met
we
must
be
abl
to
understand
it
and
it
limit
must
be
clear
the
unit
state
is
not
should
not
becom
involv
a
a
partisan
in
a
war
with
regard
to
the
lift
of
the
arm
embargo
the
question
obvious
there
is
if
you
widen
the
capac
of
peopl
to
fight
will
that
help
to
get
a
settlement
and
bring
about
peac
will
it
lead
to
more
bloodsh
what
kind
of
reaction
can
other
have
that
would
undermin
the
effect
of
the
polici
but
i
think
both
of
them
deserv
some
seriou
consider
along
with
some
other
option
we
have
q
do
you
think
that
these
peopl
who
are
tri
to
get
u
into
war
in
bosnia
are
realli
rememb
that
we
havent
taken
care
of
hundr
of
thousand
of
veteran
from
the
last
war
and
we
couldnt
take
care
of
our
prison
and
get
them
all
home
from
vietnam
and
now
mani
of
them
are
come
up
with
bill
for
treatment
of
agent
orang
how
can
we
afford
to
go
to
ani
more
of
these
war
the
presid
well
i
think
that
a
good
argument
against
the
unit
state
itself
becom
involv
a
a
belliger
in
a
war
there
but
we
are
after
all
the
world
onli
super
power
we
do
have
to
lead
the
world
and
there
is
a
veri
seriou
problem
of
systemat
ethnic
cleans
in
the
former
yugoslavia
which
could
have
not
onli
enorm
further
humanitarian
consequ
and
good
know
there
have
been
mani
but
also
could
have
other
practic
consequ
in
other
nearbi
region
where
the
same
sort
of
ethnic
tension
exist
q
did
you
make
ani
kind
of
agreement
with
bori
yeltsin
to
hold
off
either
on
air
strike
or
ani
kind
of
aggress
action
against
the
serb
until
after
sunday
and
in
gener
how
ha
hi
polit
situat
affect
your
deliber
on
bosnia
the
presid
no
i
have
not
made
ani
agreement
and
he
did
not
ask
for
that
we
never
even
discuss
that
interestingli
enough
the
russian
i
would
remind
you
in
the
middl
of
presid
yeltsin
campaign
abstain
from
our
attempt
to
get
tougher
sanction
through
the
unit
nation
in
what
i
thought
wa
the
proper
decis
for
them
and
one
that
the
unit
state
and
im
sure
the
rest
of
the
free
world
veri
much
appreci
q
do
you
wish
mr
presid
that
youd
becom
more
involv
in
the
plan
of
the
waco
oper
and
how
would
you
handl
that
situat
differ
now
the
presid
i
dont
think
a
a
practic
matter
that
the
presid
should
becom
involv
in
the
plan
of
those
kind
of
thing
at
that
detail
one
of
the
thing
that
im
sure
will
come
out
when
we
look
into
thi
is
the
question
will
be
ask
and
answer
did
all
of
u
who
up
the
line
of
command
ask
the
question
we
should
have
ask
and
get
the
answer
we
should
have
gotten
and
i
look
forward
to
that
but
at
the
time
i
have
to
say
a
i
did
befor
the
first
thing
i
did
after
the
atf
agent
were
kill
onc
we
knew
that
the
fbi
wa
go
to
go
in
wa
to
ask
that
the
militari
be
consult
becaus
of
the
quasi
a
least
militari
natur
of
the
conflict
given
the
resourc
that
koresh
had
in
hi
compound
and
their
obviou
willing
to
use
them
and
then
on
the
day
befor
the
action
i
ask
the
question
of
the
attorney
gener
which
i
have
report
to
you
previous
and
which
at
the
time
i
thought
were
suffici
i
have
a
i
said
im
sure
i
leav
it
to
other
to
make
the
suggest
about
whether
there
are
other
question
i
should
have
ask
q
mr
presid
what
is
your
assess
of
director
session
role
in
the
waco
affair
and
have
you
made
a
decis
on
hi
futur
and
if
you
havent
will
you
give
him
a
person
hear
befor
you
do
decid
the
presid
well
first
of
all
i
have
no
assess
of
hi
role
sinc
i
had
no
direct
contact
with
him
and
i
mean
no
neg
or
posit
infer
i
have
no
assess
there
i
stand
by
what
i
said
befor
about
my
gener
high
regard
for
the
fbi
and
im
wait
for
a
recommend
from
the
attorney
gener
about
what
to
do
with
the
direct
of
the
fbi
q
mr
presid
sinc
you
said
that
one
side
in
bosnia
conflict
repres
inhuman
that
the
holocaust
carri
to
the
nth
degre
whi
do
you
then
tell
u
that
the
unit
state
can
not
take
a
partisan
view
in
thi
war
the
presid
well
i
said
that
the
principl
of
ethnic
cleans
is
someth
we
ought
to
stand
up
against
that
doe
not
mean
that
the
unit
state
or
the
unit
nation
can
enter
a
war
in
effect
to
redraw
the
line
geograph
line
of
republ
within
what
wa
yugoslavia
or
that
that
would
ultim
be
success
i
think
what
the
unit
state
ha
to
do
is
to
tri
to
figur
out
whether
there
is
some
way
consist
with
forc
the
peopl
to
resolv
their
own
difficulti
we
can
stand
up
to
and
stop
ethnic
cleans
and
that
is
obvious
the
difficulti
we
are
wrestl
with
thi
is
clearli
the
most
difficult
foreign
polici
problem
we
face
and
that
all
of
our
alli
face
and
if
it
were
easi
i
suppos
it
would
have
been
solv
befor
we
have
tri
to
do
more
in
the
last
day
than
wa
previous
done
it
ha
clearli
not
been
enough
to
stop
the
serbian
aggress
and
we
are
now
look
at
what
els
we
can
do
q
yesterday
you
specif
critic
the
roosevelt
administr
for
not
have
bomb
the
railroad
to
the
concentr
camp
and
thing
that
were
near
militari
target
arent
there
step
like
that
that
would
not
involv
conflict
direct
conflict
or
partisan
belliger
that
you
might
consid
the
presid
there
may
be
i
would
remind
you
that
the
circumst
were
somewhat
differ
we
were
then
at
war
with
germani
at
the
time
and
that
what
made
that
whole
incid
so
seri
of
incid
so
perplex
but
we
have
a
i
say
weve
got
all
of
our
option
under
review
q
the
diplomat
initi
on
haiti
is
on
the
verg
of
collaps
what
can
you
do
to
salvag
it
short
of
a
fullscal
militari
oper
the
presid
well
you
may
know
someth
i
dont
that
not
what
our
peopl
tell
me
i
think
mr
caputo
and
ambassador
pezzullo
have
done
togeth
a
good
job
the
thing
keep
go
back
and
forth
becaus
of
the
peopl
who
are
involv
with
the
de
facto
govern
there
it
obviou
what
their
concern
are
they
were
the
same
concern
that
led
to
the
ouster
of
aristid
in
the
first
place
and
presid
aristid
we
feel
should
be
restor
to
power
were
work
toward
that
i
get
a
report
on
that
we
discu
it
at
least
three
time
a
week
and
im
convinc
that
were
go
to
prevail
there
and
be
success
i
do
believ
that
there
everi
reason
to
think
that
there
will
have
to
be
some
sort
of
multilater
presenc
to
tri
to
guarante
the
secur
and
the
freedom
from
violenc
of
peopl
on
both
side
of
the
ledger
while
we
tri
to
establish
the
condit
of
ongo
civil
societi
but
i
believ
were
go
to
prevail
there
q
mr
presid
would
you
care
to
make
your
assess
of
the
first
day
befor
we
make
one
for
you
laughter
the
presid
well
ill
say
if
i
believ
first
of
all
we
pass
the
budget
resolut
in
record
time
that
wa
the
biggest
issu
that
confirm
the
direct
of
the
administr
and
confirm
the
commit
of
the
campaign
that
we
could
both
bring
the
deficit
down
and
increas
invest
and
that
we
could
do
it
by
specif
spend
cut
and
by
rais
tax
almost
all
of
which
come
from
the
highest
incom
peopl
in
thi
societi
revers
a
year
trend
in
which
most
of
the
tax
burden
were
born
by
the
middl
class
whose
incom
were
go
down
when
their
tax
were
go
up
while
the
deficit
went
from
trillion
to
trillion
the
total
nation
debt
and
the
deficit
continu
to
go
up
we
have
a
year
low
in
interest
rate
from
mortgag
we
have
lower
interest
rate
across
the
board
we
have
ten
of
billion
of
dollar
flood
back
into
thi
economi
a
peopl
refin
their
debt
we
have
establish
a
new
environment
polici
which
is
dramat
differ
the
secretari
of
educ
ha
work
with
me
and
with
other
and
with
the
governor
to
establish
a
new
approach
in
educ
that
focu
on
tough
standard
a
well
a
increas
opportun
we
have
done
an
enorm
amount
of
work
on
polit
reform
on
campaign
financ
and
lobbi
reform
and
i
have
impos
tough
ethic
requir
on
my
own
administr
offici
these
thing
are
consist
with
not
onli
what
i
said
id
do
in
the
campaign
but
with
turn
the
countri
around
the
vice
presid
is
head
a
task
forc
which
will
liter
chang
the
way
the
feder
govern
oper
and
make
it
much
more
respons
to
the
citizen
of
thi
countri
we
are
work
on
a
whole
rang
of
other
thing
the
welfar
reform
initi
to
move
peopl
from
welfar
to
work
and
of
cours
a
massiv
amount
of
work
ha
been
done
on
the
health
care
issu
which
is
a
huge
econom
and
person
secur
problem
for
million
of
american
so
i
think
it
is
amaz
how
much
ha
been
done
more
will
be
done
we
also
pass
the
famili
leav
bill
a
version
of
the
motor
voter
bill
that
ha
not
come
out
of
confer
back
to
me
yet
and
everyth
ha
been
pass
except
the
stimulu
program
so
i
think
were
do
fine
and
were
move
in
the
right
direct
i
feel
good
about
it
q
sir
a
followup
wouldnt
you
say
though
that
one
of
your
biggest
initi
aid
to
soviet
russia
is
now
practic
finish
if
we
cant
pa
a
stimulu
bill
in
our
own
countri
how
can
we
do
it
for
them
the
presid
let
me
recast
the
question
a
littl
bit
it
a
good
question
laughter
it
a
good
question
but
to
be
fair
weve
got
to
recast
it
we
have
alreadi
the
first
round
of
aid
to
the
soviet
to
nonsoviet
russia
to
a
democrat
russia
is
plainli
go
to
go
through
the
first
billion
the
aid
that
we
agre
with
our
partner
in
the
g
to
provid
through
the
intern
financi
institut
which
is
a
big
dollar
item
is
plainli
go
to
go
through
the
question
is
can
we
get
ani
more
aid
for
russia
that
requir
a
new
appropri
by
the
unit
state
congress
and
that
is
a
question
i
think
mari
that
will
be
resolv
in
the
week
ahead
in
part
by
what
happen
to
the
american
worker
and
their
job
and
their
futur
i
think
the
two
thing
will
be
tie
by
mani
member
of
congress
q
the
tailhook
report
came
out
thi
morn
document
horrend
and
nearlycrimin
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
navi
how
much
did
you
discu
the
incid
and
what
might
be
done
about
it
with
your
nomine
to
be
the
secretari
of
the
navi
the
presid
first
let
me
comment
a
littl
on
that
the
inspector
gener
report
detail
conduct
which
is
wrong
and
which
ha
no
place
in
the
arm
servic
and
i
expect
the
report
to
be
act
on
in
the
appropri
way
i
also
want
to
say
to
the
american
peopl
and
to
all
of
you
that
the
report
should
be
taken
for
what
it
is
a
veri
disturb
list
of
alleg
which
will
have
to
be
thoroughli
examin
it
should
not
be
taken
a
a
gener
indict
of
the
unit
state
navi
or
of
all
the
fine
peopl
who
serv
there
it
is
veri
specif
in
it
alleg
and
it
will
be
pursu
the
onli
thing
i
said
to
the
secretarydesign
of
the
navi
and
the
onli
thing
i
should
have
said
to
him
i
think
is
that
i
expect
him
to
take
the
report
and
to
do
hi
duti
and
i
believ
he
will
do
that
q
mr
presid
to
back
to
russia
for
just
a
minut
the
latest
poll
show
that
mr
yeltsin
will
probabl
win
hi
vote
of
confid
but
there
seem
to
be
a
real
tossup
on
whether
or
not
voter
are
go
to
endors
hi
econom
reform
the
presid
i
understand
that
q
can
you
live
with
a
split
laughter
can
you
live
with
a
split
decis
though
or
do
you
need
both
pass
in
order
to
then
build
support
for
russian
aid
the
presid
i
believ
the
answer
to
your
question
is
for
the
unit
state
the
key
question
should
be
that
which
is
pose
to
ani
democraci
which
is
who
win
the
elect
if
he
win
the
elect
if
he
is
ratifi
by
the
russian
peopl
to
continu
a
their
presid
then
i
think
we
should
do
our
best
to
work
with
him
toward
reform
you
know
we
had
a
lot
of
other
countri
here
for
the
holocaust
museum
dedic
their
leader
were
here
leader
from
eastern
europ
leader
from
at
least
one
republ
of
the
former
soviet
union
all
of
them
have
terribl
econom
challeng
a
they
convert
from
a
communist
command
and
control
economi
to
a
market
economi
in
a
world
where
there
econom
slowdown
everywher
and
in
a
world
in
which
there
econom
slowdown
and
difficulti
all
leader
will
have
troubl
have
their
polici
be
popular
in
a
poll
becaus
they
havent
produc
the
result
that
the
peopl
so
earnestli
yearn
for
you
can
understand
that
but
if
they
have
confid
in
the
leadership
i
think
that
all
we
can
ask
and
the
unit
state
will
if
the
russian
peopl
ratifi
him
a
their
presid
and
stick
with
him
then
the
unit
state
will
continu
to
work
with
him
i
think
he
is
a
genuin
democrat
small
d
and
genuin
commit
to
reform
i
think
that
we
should
support
that
q
mr
presid
mr
perot
ha
come
out
strongli
in
what
is
perceiv
behind
the
line
against
a
free
trade
agreement
nafta
how
hard
are
you
go
to
fight
for
thi
free
trade
agreement
and
when
do
you
expect
to
see
it
accomplish
the
presid
i
think
well
have
the
agreement
readi
in
the
fairli
near
futur
you
know
our
peopl
are
still
work
with
the
mexican
govern
and
with
the
canadian
on
the
side
agreement
were
tri
to
work
out
what
the
environment
agreement
will
say
what
the
labor
agreement
will
say
and
then
what
the
fairest
way
to
deal
with
enforc
is
the
mexican
say
and
there
is
some
merit
to
their
posit
that
theyr
worri
about
transfer
their
sovereignti
in
enforc
to
a
multilater
commiss
even
in
the
unit
state
to
be
fair
we
have
some
folk
who
are
worri
about
that
about
give
that
up
on
the
other
hand
if
were
go
to
have
an
environment
agreement
and
a
labor
standard
agreement
that
mean
someth
then
there
ha
to
be
ultim
some
consequ
for
violat
them
so
what
were
tri
to
do
is
to
agre
on
an
approach
which
would
say
that
if
there
is
a
pattern
of
violat
if
you
keep
on
violat
it
past
a
certain
point
mayb
not
an
isol
incid
but
a
pattern
of
violat
there
is
go
to
be
some
enforc
there
must
be
consequ
and
were
work
out
the
detail
of
that
but
i
still
feel
quit
good
about
it
and
thi
is
just
an
area
where
i
disagre
with
mr
perot
and
with
other
i
think
that
we
will
win
big
if
we
have
a
fair
agreement
that
integr
more
close
the
mexican
economi
and
the
american
economi
and
lead
u
from
there
to
chile
to
other
market
economi
in
latin
america
and
give
u
a
bigger
world
in
which
to
trade
i
think
that
the
onli
way
a
rich
countri
can
grow
richer
if
you
look
at
what
japan
and
other
countri
in
the
pacif
are
do
to
reach
out
in
their
own
region
it
a
pretti
good
lesson
to
u
that
we
had
better
worri
about
how
to
build
those
bridg
in
our
own
area
so
thi
is
an
idea
battl
you
know
youv
got
a
lot
of
question
and
i
want
to
answer
them
all
but
let
me
say
not
everi
one
of
these
thing
can
be
distil
simpli
into
polit
you
know
who
for
thi
and
who
for
that
and
if
thi
person
is
for
thi
somebodi
els
ha
got
to
be
for
that
a
lot
of
these
thing
honestli
involv
real
debat
over
idea
over
who
right
and
wrong
about
the
world
toward
which
were
move
and
the
answer
are
not
selfevid
and
one
of
the
reason
that
i
want
to
run
for
presid
is
i
want
to
sort
of
open
the
floodgat
for
debat
these
idea
so
that
we
could
tri
to
chang
in
the
appropri
way
so
i
just
have
a
differ
of
opinion
i
believ
that
the
concept
of
nafta
is
sound
even
though
a
you
know
i
thought
that
the
detail
need
to
be
improv
q
mr
presid
there
wa
a
tremend
flurri
of
interest
earlier
thi
month
in
the
russian
document
that
purport
to
show
that
the
vietnames
had
held
back
american
prison
gener
vessey
ha
now
said
publicli
that
while
the
document
itself
wa
authent
he
belief
that
it
wa
incorrect
do
you
have
a
person
view
at
thi
point
about
that
issu
and
more
broadli
do
you
believ
that
in
fact
the
vietnames
did
return
all
the
american
prison
at
the
time
of
the
pari
peac
accord
the
presid
first
let
me
say
i
saw
gener
vessey
befor
he
went
to
vietnam
and
after
he
return
and
i
have
a
high
regard
for
him
and
i
appreci
hi
willing
to
serv
hi
countri
in
thi
way
a
to
whether
the
document
had
ani
basi
in
fact
let
me
say
that
the
govern
of
vietnam
wa
more
forthcom
than
it
had
been
in
the
past
and
gave
u
some
document
that
would
tend
to
undermin
the
valid
of
the
russian
document
claim
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
right
or
wrong
we
are
have
it
basic
evalu
at
thi
time
and
when
we
complet
the
evalu
well
tell
you
and
of
cours
we
want
to
tell
the
famili
of
those
who
were
miss
in
action
or
who
were
pow
i
think
that
well
be
abl
to
make
some
progress
in
elimin
some
of
the
question
about
the
outstand
case
a
a
result
of
thi
last
interchang
but
i
can
not
say
that
im
fulli
satisfi
that
we
know
all
that
we
need
to
know
there
are
still
some
case
that
we
dont
know
the
answer
to
but
i
do
believ
were
make
some
progress
i
wa
encourag
by
the
last
trip
q
id
like
to
follow
up
on
that
befor
the
u
normal
relat
allow
trade
to
go
forward
do
you
have
to
be
person
sure
that
everi
case
ha
been
resolv
or
would
you
be
will
to
go
forward
on
the
basi
that
while
it
may
take
year
to
resolv
these
case
the
vietnames
have
made
suffici
offer
to
u
to
confirm
good
faith
the
presid
a
lot
of
expert
say
you
can
never
resolv
everi
case
everi
one
that
we
couldnt
resolv
all
the
case
for
them
and
that
there
are
still
some
case
that
have
not
been
factual
resolv
go
back
to
the
second
world
war
but
what
i
would
have
to
be
convinc
of
is
that
we
had
gone
a
long
way
toward
resolv
everi
case
that
could
be
resolv
at
thi
moment
in
time
and
that
there
wa
a
complet
open
and
unrestrict
commit
to
continu
to
do
everyth
that
could
be
done
alway
to
keep
resolv
those
case
and
were
not
there
yet
again
i
have
to
be
guid
a
littl
bit
by
peopl
who
know
a
lot
about
thi
and
i
confess
to
be
much
more
heavili
influenc
by
the
famili
of
the
peopl
whose
life
were
lost
there
or
whose
life
remain
in
question
than
by
the
commerci
interest
and
the
other
thing
which
seem
so
compel
in
thi
moment
i
just
am
veri
influenc
by
how
the
famili
feel
q
your
econom
stimulu
packag
are
you
do
some
kind
of
realiti
check
now
and
scale
back
some
of
your
plan
your
legisl
plan
for
the
come
year
includ
the
crime
bill
the
health
care
initi
and
other
thing
are
there
ani
plan
to
do
that
and
also
did
you
underestim
the
power
of
senat
bob
dole
the
presid
no
what
i
underestim
wa
the
extent
to
which
what
i
thought
wa
a
fairli
selfevid
case
particularli
after
we
stay
below
the
spend
cap
approv
by
thi
congress
includ
the
republican
who
were
in
thi
congress
last
year
when
we
had
alreadi
pass
a
budget
resolut
which
call
for
over
billion
in
deficit
reduct
when
they
had
vote
repeatedli
for
supplement
appropri
to
help
foreign
govern
i
thought
at
least
four
of
them
would
vote
to
break
clotur
and
i
underestim
that
i
did
not
have
an
adequ
strategi
of
deal
with
that
i
also
thought
that
if
i
made
a
goodfaith
effort
to
negoti
and
to
compromis
that
it
would
not
be
rebuf
instead
everi
time
i
offer
someth
they
reduc
the
offer
that
they
had
previous
been
talk
to
the
major
leader
about
so
it
wa
a
strang
set
of
event
but
i
think
what
happen
wa
what
wa
a
signific
part
of
our
plan
but
not
the
major
part
of
it
acquir
a
polit
connot
that
got
out
of
proport
to
the
merit
so
that
a
lot
of
republican
were
say
to
me
privat
mr
presid
id
like
to
be
for
thi
but
i
cant
now
and
were
all
strung
out
and
were
divid
and
i
think
we
need
to
do
a
realiti
check
a
i
said
what
i
want
to
know
let
me
go
back
to
what
i
said
what
i
want
to
know
from
our
folk
and
from
our
friend
in
the
senat
on
and
republican
or
democrat
is
what
could
i
have
done
differ
to
make
it
come
out
differ
becaus
the
real
loser
here
were
not
the
presid
and
the
administr
the
real
loser
were
the
hundr
of
thousand
of
peopl
who
wont
have
job
now
we
could
have
put
anoth
kid
to
work
thi
summer
i
mean
we
could
have
done
a
lot
of
good
thing
with
that
money
and
i
think
that
is
veri
veri
sad
and
it
becam
more
polit
than
it
should
have
but
the
underli
rational
i
dont
think
hold
a
lot
of
water
that
it
wa
deficit
spend
that
just
wont
wash
q
and
redo
the
presid
no
i
mean
you
know
for
exampl
you
mention
the
crime
bill
i
think
it
would
be
a
real
mistak
not
to
pa
the
crime
bill
i
mean
the
crime
bill
wa
almost
on
the
point
of
passag
last
year
and
they
were
all
fight
over
the
bradi
bill
sure
sure
after
what
we
have
been
through
in
thi
countri
just
in
the
last
three
month
with
the
kind
of
mindless
violenc
we
have
seen
we
can
pa
a
bill
requir
peopl
to
go
through
a
wait
period
befor
they
buy
a
handgun
and
sure
we
can
see
that
we
need
more
polic
offic
on
the
street
that
anoth
thing
that
i
realli
believ
that
onc
we
move
some
of
that
money
not
all
but
some
of
it
up
into
thi
job
packag
to
make
some
of
the
job
rehir
polic
offic
on
the
street
whod
been
laid
off
that
would
be
a
compel
case
i
mean
peopl
are
scare
in
thi
countri
and
i
think
we
need
to
go
forward
i
feel
veri
strongli
that
we
need
to
go
forward
on
the
crime
bill
q
mr
presid
back
to
the
tailhook
report
for
a
second
that
report
contain
veri
strong
critic
of
the
navi
senior
leadership
in
gener
but
did
not
name
ani
of
the
senior
offic
do
you
believ
that
the
senior
offic
who
are
implic
in
thi
includ
admir
kelso
who
wa
there
one
night
in
la
vega
should
they
be
disciplin
and
do
you
believ
the
public
ha
a
right
to
know
the
name
of
the
senior
offic
the
presid
you
should
know
that
under
the
rule
of
law
which
appli
to
thi
i
am
in
the
chain
of
command
there
is
now
an
inspector
gener
report
and
the
law
must
take
it
cours
if
i
were
to
answer
that
question
i
might
prejudic
ani
decis
which
might
be
later
made
in
thi
case
i
dont
realli
think
i
think
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
i
have
alreadi
said
i
wa
veri
disturb
by
the
specif
alleg
in
the
inspector
gener
report
and
i
want
appropri
action
to
be
taken
until
the
proper
procedur
have
a
chanc
to
kick
in
and
appropri
action
is
taken
i
have
been
advis
that
becaus
i
am
the
commanderinchief
i
have
to
be
veri
care
about
what
i
say
so
a
not
to
prejudic
the
right
of
anybodi
against
whom
ani
action
might
proceed
or
to
prejudic
the
case
in
ani
other
way
either
pro
or
con
so
i
cant
say
ani
more
except
to
say
that
i
want
thi
thing
handl
in
an
appropri
and
thorough
way
q
mr
presid
could
i
ask
you
for
a

that
includ
ani
air
forc
a
well
a

forc

the

forc
q
you
said

forc
could
i
ask
