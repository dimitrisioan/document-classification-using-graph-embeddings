let
take
a
quick
look
at
what
you
are
say
the
median
of
a
distribut
is
that
variatevalu
which
divid
the
distribut
halfway
ie
of
the
distribut
popul
have
lower
and
half
have
higher
variatevalu
so
for
male
the
median
thi
mean
that
half
of
these
men
are
higher
than
thi
and
half
are
lower
than
thi
now
if
the
popul
sampl
size
is
and
of
them
are
gay
male
are
gay
if
we
actual
were
either
exclus
homosexu
or
bisexu
you
arent
readi
veri
care
say
they
are
distribut
equal
then
onli
are

sexual
partner
of

thi
mean
that

are
