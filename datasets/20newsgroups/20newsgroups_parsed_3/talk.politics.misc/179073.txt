a
to
conscienc
and
whether

well
i
mean
i
think
everybodi
feel
badli
when
you

a
situat
when
q
i
understand
that
but
whether
the
issu
of
blame
is
brought
up
in
that
phraseolog
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
that
the
spirit
no
it
ha
noth
to
do
with
that
the
spirit
with
which
it
wa
offer
wa
that
the
entir
administr
and
certainli
the
attorney

a
veri
difficult
decis
a
veri
difficult
situat
yesterday
and
that
he
thought
that
she
had
handl
it
well
a
best
a
she
could
and
q
well
doe
he
think
it
wa
mishandl
mr
stephanopoulo
it
wa
just
speak
of
warm
word
to
a
friend
q
doe
he
think
the
situat
wa
mishandl
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
q
in
retrospect
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
stand
by
the
decis
of
the
law
enforc
agenc
the
decis
of
the
attorney
gener
he
accept
full
respons
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
we
all
want
to
look
to
the
futur
and
figur
out
what
exactli
happen
do
a
full
review
and
make
sure
we
do
what
we
can
to
make
sure
thi
doesnt
happen
thi
kind
of
thing
doesnt
happen
again
or
at
least
we
know
how
to
handl
it
q
how
much
did
he
know
about
what
she
wa
go
to
go
ahead
with
i
know
that
she
made
the
case
to
him
explain
outlin
the
case
for
action
did
she
say
to
him
on
sunday
precis
what
action
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
think
it
wa
specif
oper
detail
a
to
what
wa
go
to
happen
i
think
that
they
had
a
gener
discus
about
the
action
about
the
advis
of
action
i
think
a
she
note
he
ask
a
few
gener
question
just
tri
to
get
a
sen
of
how
thing
were
consid
but
it
wasnt
minutebyminut

of
how
the
oper
q
well
wa
it
we
are
go
in
is
it
were
go
to
use
tear
ga
i
mean
what
mr
stephanopoulo
i
believ
it
wa
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
some
action
that
would
increas
the
pressur
on
those
in
the
compound
and
hope
spur
them
toward
some
sort
of
movement
out
q
georg
wa
there
ever
a
consciou
polit
decis
made
or
even
a
discus
about
distanc
the
presid
from

i
mean
we
were
in
close
contact
with
the
justic
depart
the
presid
accept
respons
for
thi
at
the
same
time
i
mean
we

veri
veri
clear
about
how
thi
happen
and
be
a
factual
a
we
could
be
on
how
the
decis
were
made
it
is
the
respons
of
those
on
the
ground
to
make
recommend
the
attorney

the

obvious

now
in
term
of
the
stuff
that
come
out
sinc
then
about

inform
provid
by
the
listen
devic
about

get
increasingli
more
violent
mr

again
im
not
certain
how

specif
detail
they
got
into
i
know
that
she
gener
said
that
thi
is
the
recommend
she
prepar
to
make
i
mean
the
decis
she
prepar
to
make
it
base
on
the
recommend
she
wa
receiv
from
the
field
and
after
intens
question
of
those
involv
again
i
do
not
know
how
precis
detail
it
wa
beyond
that
q
what
is
the
presid
understand
whi
yesterday
one
of
the
peopl
who
went
into
the
compound
a
coupl
week
ago
came
out
over
the
weekend
with
some
specul
that
he
may
have
told
law
enforc
peopl
someth
that
precipit
thi
action
whi
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulo
thi
is
the
first
ive
heard
i
think
what
we
can
go
to
is
what
the
fbi
and
the
attorney
gener
ha
said
there
were
indic
that
those
insid
the
compound
were
at
some
danger
it
wa
clear
that
the
negoti
had
broken
down
and
it
wa
the
judgment
of
the
expert
involv
in
the
negoti
that
the
situat
wa
not
go
to
get
ani
better
at
all
there
wa
also
some
concern
over
the
vulner
of
the
agent
themselv
who
had
been
work
long
beyond
the
time
that
these
team
normal
have
to
work
and
a
the
attorney
gener
ha
said
there
wa
some
concern
over
the
fact
that
they
did
not
have
replac
in
place
who
could
stand
in
for
them
and
there
wa
a
concern
over
the
safeti
all
of
these
factor
came
into
play
they
also
consid
the
advic
of
a
number
of
psychologist
and
other
expert
on
david
koresh
and
those
in
the
compound
i
would
just
go
back
to
what
the
attorney
gener
ha
said
you
have
to
make
the
best
judgment
you
can
given
the
inform
you
have
at
the
time
they
did
obvious
we
all
regret
the
loss
of
life
it
a
terribl
unfortun
situat
we
all
wish
it
could
have
turn
out
differ
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
judgment
that
were
made
at
the
time
q
georg
when
did
the
presid
know
that
they
were
go
to
use
tear
ga
wa
it
befor
the
assault
on
the
compound
mr
stephanopoulo
i
just
dont
know
i
dont
believ
he
wa
given
a
lot
of
detail
on
exactli
how
the
oper
would
go
i
just
dont
know
q
along
that
point
georg
can
you
say
whether
the
plan
wa
present
to
the
presid
by
the
attorney
gener
a
a
way
to
end
the
standoff
one
way
or
the
other
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
it
wa
present
a
a
way
to
increas
the
pressur
on
those
in
the
compound
and
we
all
hope
a
a
way
to
move
some
of
those
out
and
bring
it
in
it
wasnt
present
a
tomorrow
is
dday
thi
is
it
q
is
the
presid
satisfi
that
a
he
had
all
thi
relev
inform
necessari
to
make
a
decis
and
b
that
janet
reno
had
all
the
relev
inform
necessari
to
make
a
decis
mr
stephanopoulo
oh
i
think
he
satisfi
that
they
were
act
on
the
best
advic
and
the
best
inform
they

and
he
not
secondguess
it
in
ani
way
whatsoev
q
georg
wa
there
a
hour
gap
between

between
the

they

at
am
and
they
didnt

what
you

wa
mr

that
just
not
right
susan
q
well
i
think
you
can
go
back
to
the
transcript
i
mean
unless
i
miss
someth
mr
stephanopoulo
id
love
to
q
janet
reno
said
that
she
took
full
respons
and
you
said
that
she
made
the
decis
that
the
fbi
mr
stephanopoulo
and
the
presid
take
respons
absolut
q
took
respons
all
right
mr
stephanopoulo
check
the
transcript
q
consid
how
littl
wa
known
about
what
wa
go
on
insid
the
compound
and
even
now
how
littl
is
known
whi
is
washington
call
thi
a
mass
suicid
mr
stephanopoulo
well
i
think
that
know
what
we
know
now
and
given
all
of
the
action
of
david
koresh
befor
and
dure
it
is
pain
clear
that
those
there
were
under
hi
control
q
it
stretch
it
a
littl
bit
where
the
kid
are
concern
though
isnt
it
georg
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
that
that
is
an
entir
differ
matter
i
mean
i
think
that
david
koresh
must
bear
respons
for
the
death
of
those
child
absolut
but
he
clearli
wa
intent
on
creat
some
kind
of
an
apocalypt
incid
and
that
what
he
did
q
your
still
oper
complet
on
assumpt
right
i
mean
you
have
no
evid
or
you
know
of
no
evid
that
thi
wa
mass
suicid
mr
stephanopoulo
we
have
evid
that
those
insid
the
compound
set
fire
to
the
compound
which
led
to
the
death
of
those
insid
q
i
didnt
quit
hear
it
thi
might
be
ann
question
i
didnt
quit
hear
it
but
at
what
time
did
clinton
himself
put
out
a
statement
on
thi
i
know
dee
dee
said
some
stuff
on
thi
at
pm
but
the
presid
put
out
mr
stephanopoulo
at
pm
pm
q
right
after
the
even
news
went
on
the
air
mr
stephanopoulo
no
right
when
we
had
all
the
inform
we
were
work
on
it
q
dee
dee
confirm
thi
morn
that
the
investig
the
presid
is
go
to
announc
is
go
to
be
an
administrationrun
investig
whi
not
have
someon
from
the
outsid
to
make
sure
that
it
not
color
by
those
who
would
have
a
polit
stake
particularli
those
at
the
atf
whose
action
have
alreadi
been
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
that
clearli
the
atf
and
the
justic
depart
will
bear
respons
for
the
investig
that
not
to
rule
out
a
is
often
in
investig
like
thi
have
some
sort
of
independ
involv
a
well
but
it
will
be
run
by
the
treasuri
and
justic
q
are
you
confid
that
you
will
not
have
ani
problem
get
mr
stephanopoulo
absolut
q
georg
did
the
presid
reach
out
to
anybodi
el
to
get
advic
after
the
meet
with
janet
reno
and
who
el
in
the
white
hous
sat
in
on
that
meet
anyon
el
from
justic
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
believ
anybodi
el
wa
there
at
the
time
it
wa
a
phone
call
on
monday
it
wasnt
a
meet
q
sunday
mr
stephanopoulo
sunday
it
wa
a
phone
call
it
wasnt
a
meet
i
believ
he
might
have
been
there
with
bruce
but
beyond
that
i
think
he
just
talk
to
the
attorney
gener
q
georg
you
said
that
in
that
phone
call
she
said
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
action
a
you
said
that
will
forc
him
out
what
did
he
think
she
wa
talk
about
if
he
didnt
know
about
tear
ga
what
exactli
wa
hi
idea
of
what
he
wa
approv
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
he
wa
approv
an
action
to
increas
the
pressur
on
qq
it
didnt
matter
how
she
did
that
mr
stephanopoulo
no
no
i
mean
q
what
inform
did
he
have
in
term
of
how
thi
would
proceed
presum
he
would
have
want
to
know
not
minut
byminut
but
in
a
gener
sen
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
he
knew
that
thi
wa
the
recommend
of
those
on
the
ground
and
the
recommend
of
the
law
enforc
agenc
i
just
dont
know
q
what
is
thi
when
you
say
that
thi
wa
the
recommend
mr
stephanopoulo
the
action
to
increas
pressur
i
dont
know
exactli
what
he
wa
told
whether
he
wa
go
to
be
told
that
the
tank
wa
go
to
go
up
to
the
left
wall
and
punch
a
hole
in
the
window
or
whether
he
wa
just
told
gener
that
they
were
move
forward
in
a
way
that
would
increas
the
pressur
i
just
dont
know
q
it
hard
to
imagin
him
not
ask
though
q
that
janet
reno
present
him
with
a
her
best
advic
about
what
they
should
go
forward
with
he
would
have
agre
mr
stephanopoulo
he
wa
he
did
ask
some
gener
question
about
the
advic
and
recommend
he
gave
at
the
same
time
and
i
would
repeat
that
thi
wa
base
on
the
unanim
recommend
of
the
law
enforc
agenc
involv
q
georg
it
would
seem
that
thi
question
about
just
exactli
in
what
detail
the
presid
wa
inform
about
the
natur
of
the
oper
is
go
to
come
up

of

q

she
made
a
decis
a
attorney

that
it
wa
import
for
her
a
the
oper
offic
in
charg
a
the
person
who

the
decis
to

out
and
take
the
question
on
thi
tragic
incid
q
she
had
no
guidanc
from
the
white
hous
at
all
mr
stephanopoulo
we
certainli
didnt
object
q
but
did
you
laughter
no
im
sure
you
didnt
object
but
did
you
suggest
it
wa
thi
a
plan
mr
stephanopoulo
no
absolut
not
q
a
strategi
mr
stephanopoulo
no
q
did
she
clear
it
mr
stephanopoulo
no
q
did
she
notifi
you
mr
stephanopoulo
we
certainli
knew
about
it
q
what
happen
to
thi
great
detail
process
you
have
for
clear
and
talk
to
everi
public
inform
offic
and
everi
under
everi
rock
and
everi
place
in
govern
that
someth
a
major
a
thi
could
have
occur
without
a
discus
between
you
and
the
public
inform
peopl
at
least
at
the
justic
depart
mr
stephanopoulo
the
attorney
gener
made
the
decis
and
the
attorney
gener
want
to
go
forward
it
seem
like
a
good
decis
it
wa
a
good
decis
she
did
a
good
job
q
let
me
ask
it
thi
way
georg
if
in
hindsight
how
you
would
handl
it
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
it
wa
handl
veri
well
q
you
wouldnt
chang
a
thing
if
mr
stephanopoulo
chang
what
q
the
way
the
white
hous
handl
ani
part
of
it
from
start
to
finish
mr
stephanopoulo
well
i
think
that
an
aw
broad
question
and
were
certainli
go
to
have
a
review
one
of
the
reason
for
the
investig
is
to
look
for
way
in
the
futur
that
someth
like
thi
see
what
we
can
learn
from
an
incid
like
thi
and
see
what
we
can
learn
about
how
to
handl
them
if
your
talk
specif
about
the
issu
of
the
press
confer
no
there
wouldnt
make
ani
chang
at
all
q
two
question
first
of
all
on
her
go
on
tv
no
white
hous
peopl
or
outsid
medium
consult
came
up
with
thi
idea
it
just
veri
reminisc
of
what
you
guy
did
dure
the
campaign
mr
stephanopoulo
how
so
q
im
think
of
like
watch
clinton
on
nightlin
after
the
draft
stori
watch
clinton
on
mr
stephanopoulo
there
absolut
no
comparison
yesterday
there
wa
a
law
enforc
incid
the
incid
end
in
tragic
death
of
mani
mani
peopl
the
attorney
gener
wa
involv
in
that
decis
the
attorney
gener
made
the
decis
to
do
that
she
felt
it
wa
her
respons
in
the
interest
of
public
inform
to
go
out
and
take
the
question
of
the
press
in
order
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
question
were
answer
and
she
did
a
fantast
job
q
the
second
question
is
did
a
someon
who
know
clinton
a
well
a
you
do
can
you
understand
whi
it
sort
of
hard
to
believ
that
he
might
not
have
ask
some
detail
question
about
what
she
intend
to
do
in
other
word
she
came
and
she
said
im
go
to
put
pressur
on
them
it
hard
not
to
see
clinton
who
fairli
intellig
and
inquisit
ask
how
q
what
kind
mr
stephanopoulo
both
the
attorney
gener
said
that
he
did
ask
question
he
did
ask
gener
question
i
dont
have
a
minutebyminut
account
of
the
convers
q
how
long
a
convers
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
it
wa
about
minut
q
telephon
convers
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
q
georg
wa
the
feder
cost
of
thi
standoff
ever
a
consider
in
term
of
step
up
the
pressur
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
believ
so
no
q
georg
you
keep
say
that
the
presid
take
full
respons
but
then
you
refer
to
it
a
her
decis
doe
the
presid
not
accept
the
fact
that
a
commanderinchief
it
is
ultim
hi
decis
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
know
what
thi
ha
to
do
with
commanderinchief
thi
wa
a
law
enforc
action
not
a
militari
action
and
he
clearli
take
respons
for
the
decis
of
the
law
enforc
agenc
involv
taken
in
hi
govern
i
mean
i
think
there
just
no
ambigu
about
that
q
but
is
he
accept
it
a
hi
decis
a
well
a
her
or
is
he
say
it
her
decis
there
a
differ
mr
stephanopoulo
a
a
matter
of
fact
it
wa
her
decis
he
did
not
object
to
that
decis
he
clearli
take
full
respons
q
georg
thi
brief
ha
gone
on
just
a
littl
over
minut
and
a
you
can
see
a
lot
of
thing
can
be
exchang
what
exactli
did
they
spend
minut
talk
about
if
it
wa
just
veri
gener
that
a
long
period
of
time
in
a
phone
convers
mr
stephanopoulo
it
is
an
aw
long
phone
convers
it
wa
a
veri
import
phone
convers
i
think
brit
ha
ask
that
we
take
the
question
and
ive
said
that
i
would
q
one
of
the
thing
reno
said
last
night
is
that
the
buck
stop
here
i
think
that
wa
her
direct
quotat
doe
the
presid
agre
with
that
in
thi
case
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
say
he
accept
full
respons
i
think
what
the
attorney
gener
wa
say
is
that
she
made
a
decis
that
she
go
to
accept
all
the
respons
that
come
to
her
and
she
not
shrink
from
that
at
all
but
neither
is
the
presid
q
at
ani
point
in
the
convers
last
night
between
the
presid
and
the
attorney
gener
or
thi
morn
did
she
ever
offer
her
a
resign
mr
stephanopoulo
not
to
my
knowledg
q
even
befor
the
fire
wa
out

some
republican
on

is
the

all
concern
about
the
time
of

request
tri
to
make

hay
out
of
thi
situat
mr
stephanopoulo
no
and
i
dont
want
to
cast

question
about
the
motiv
of
those

we

what

a
seri
of
meet
with
differ
member
of
the

dure
the
afternoon
he
wa
certainli
monitor
the
situat
in
waco
and
get
period
report
on
that
a
well
he
did
see
some
on
cnn
a
well
i
believ
he
saw
a
fair
amount
of
the
fbi
press
brief
a
well
q
and
those
report
would
have
come
to
him
from
mack
mclarti
would
they
do
you
think
mr
stephanopoulo
mack
talk
to
him
bruce
talk
to
him
i
talk
to
him
q
georg
to
follow
helen
question
in
their
convers
thi
morn
did
they
discus
at
all
her
statement
last
night
in
respons
to
the
question
about
whether
she
would

did
he
say
i
dont

i
learn
about
the

wa
that
it
wa
larg
about
the

itself

thi
just
didnt
come

whi
werent
there
replac

a
veri
small
highlyspeci
unit

think
it
one
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
investig
will
examin
q
georg
isnt
there
a
factor
here
involv
the
fbi
director
normal
a
presid
when
he
want
to
get
inform
doesnt
onli
ask
the
attorney
gener
i
know
the
chain
of
command
but
presid
talk
to
their
fbi
director
in
thi
case
throughout
thi
entir
sieg
he
ha
not
felt
that
he
could
pick
up
the
phone
and
talk
to
bill
session
who
is
from
waco
and
get
expertis
from
him
on
what
to
do
and
what
not
to

think
he

to
the
fbi
director
well

begin
of
the
situat
when

you
think
the
ambigu
situat
that
director
session
is
in
ha
some
impact
on
the
way
the
presid
is
brief
and
on
the
way

of
thi
evolv
mr

appropri
that
