dont
look
at
me
i
want
to
send
aid
to
russia
mani
other
conserv
do
a
well
ye
it
wa
nixon
who
wa
most
vocal
about
give
money
to
russia
it
make
me
proud
to
be
a
libertarian
it
appear
both
conserv
and
liber
prefer
to
cold
war
until
you
win
then
nurs
the
enemi
back
to
health
for
anoth
go
around
enemi
sound
like
that
the
viewpoint
of
the
stereotyp
redneck
conserv
alway
been
commi
alway
will
be
ok
i
should
have
said
former
enemi
i
wa
be
sarcast
about
what
interventionist
want
to
do
i
suggest
you
listen
veri
care
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
hi
peopl
are
say
and
compar
that
with
the
veri
antiwest
slogan
come
from
hi
oppon
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
could
we
back
him
without
forc
other
to
back
him
at
the
point
of
a
gun
have
you
consid
a
noninterventionist
polici
if
market
reform
doe
happen
russia
will
certainli
get
privat
capit
at
privat
risk
to
help
their
economi
they
will
even
have
incent
to
do
so
for
the
same
reason
if
they
dont
reform
then
our
govern
will
probabl
consid
them
enemi
anyway
and
rather
spend
money
to
hurt
rather
than
help
them
then
their
the
ideolog
point
we
want
to
win
russia
over
to
our
type
of
govern
a
type
where
the
ruler
can
rule
without
limit
over
everyon
financ
it
like
subsid
the
wealthi
countri
japan
germani
etc
with
free
defens
and
then
tradewar
with
them
becaus
of
the
econom
competit
it
like
subsid
tobacco
farmer
while
pay
bureaucrat
to
pursuad
peopl
not
to
smoke
better
to
let
them
degener
into
civil
war
rememb
all
those
nuclear
weapon
in
russia
i
can
not
imagin
that
they
would
not
be
use
in
a
civil
war
if
nationialist
take
over
and
even
if
they
prevent
a
civil
war
most
feel
they
must
take
back
larg
part
of
land
that
are
in
other
countri
like
ukrain
i
also
can
not
imagin
ukrain
give
up
land
without
a
fight
possibl
nuclear
how
doe
thi
affect
u
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
track
of
europ
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
someth
a
massiv
breakup
of
a
countri
that
span
th
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affect
here
of
cours
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democraci
should
help
other
democraci
or
struggl
democraci
if
a
billion
gift
wa
that
import
to
our
well
be
couldnt
it
be
rais
voluntarilli
peopl
alreadi
give
over
billion
a
year
to
chariti
i
ask
myself
what
law
could
we
pas
to
prevent
govern
from
do
stupid
frivil
thing
with
our
money
then
i
think
the
constitut
wa
suppos
to
do
that
could
someon
plea
tell
me
what
legitim
constitut
power
the
feder
govern
is
use
when
it
take
money
from
my
paycheck
and
give
it
to
needi
countri
serious
serious
everyon
ha
differ
opinion
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
caus
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong
space
program
someon
el
will
champion
welfar
or
educ
or
do
studi
of
drunken
goldfish
that
is
whi
we
have
a
republ
and
not
a
true
democraci
instead
of
gridlock
on
a
massiv
scale
we
onli
have
gridlock
on
a
congression
scale
it
seem
instead
of
gridlock
on
ani
scale
we
have
aid
to
russia
expens
space
program
nation
chariti
that
doesnt
help
the
poor
and
probabl
studi
of
drunken
goldfish
i
think
limit
govern
is
more
key
than
how
democrat
it
is
btw
who
is
to
decid
stupid
thi
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impos
their
moral
on
other
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarian
were
against
that
wa
an
opinion
and
libertarian
are
veri
big
on
free
speech
actual
my
polit
are
pretti
libertarian
except
on
thi
one
issu
and
thi
is
whi
it
is
imposs
for
me
to
join
the
parti
it
seem
that
libertarian
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
if
you
are
pretti
libertarian
except
on
thi
one
issu
then
you
should
be
veri
libertarian
consid
it
a
compromis
how
much
money
would
your
fellow
russiaaid
have
to
give
to
russia
if
those
you
oppos
werent
use
the
same
govern
machin
to
steal
money
from
you
and
your
group
for
caus
you
dont
support
we
could
do
that
year
ago
but
not
now
peopl
have
been
say
that
for
hundr
of
year
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
begin
of
a
global
economi
and
global
decis
make
all
the
more
reason
to
depend
on
the
free
market
which
can
more
effici
process
inform
than
to
depend
on
ruler
for
decis
on
complex
issu
juli
disclaim
