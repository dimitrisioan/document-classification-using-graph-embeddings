and
batteri
whi
must
we
add
gay
bash
to
the
list
isnt
thi
a
sort

or
am
i
just
be
a
fascist
again
to
deter
an
epidem
of
gay
bash
that
ha
not
been
deter
by
assault
law
so
we
ought
to
make
beat
up
a
homosexu
more
illeg
than
beat
up
a
straight
and
who
advoc
that
hate

say
here
wa
with

state
someon
may
be
charg
multipl
time
for
one
act
if
the
victim
in
question
is
of
the
right
shade
a
singl
act
should
never
merit
more
than
on
charg
so
if
i
set

in
the
world
trade
center
i
can
onli
be
charg
with
more
than
