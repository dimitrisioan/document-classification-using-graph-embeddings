not
in
what
i
saw
up
here
in
canada
or
on
cnn
which
is
sent
up
here
dure
the
thoma
nomin
hear
sure
one
would
think
that
her
claim
to

been
sexual
harass
would
have
a
great
deal
le
credibl
if
it
could
be
shown
that
she
had
herself
been
guilti
of
it
or
do
you
regard
sworn

paper
ahemmm
it
depend
for

if
it
