sinc
war
broke
out
in

seem
that
it
onli
a
disput
between
argentina
and
great
britain
over
the
barren
windswept
falkland
island
and
south
georgia
island
in
realiti
it
far
more
than
that
the
socal
falkland
crisi
is
just
the
visibl
tip
of
a
giant
militari
oper
dure
thi
month
of
april
fierc
naval
battl
have
taken
placenot
onli
in
the
south
atlant
but
also
in
the
south
pacif
up
to
now
most
of
the
hostil
have
been
kept
under
wrap
by
wartim
censorship
on
all
side
but
a
i
say
these
word
the
naval
war
in
the
southern
hemispher
is
about
to
come
to
the
surfac
begin
today
april
a
total
naval
and
air
blockad
of
the
falkland
by
the
royal
navi
ha
begun
at
the
same
time
a
counterblockad
ha
been
declar
by
argentina
in
the
same
area
to
be
effect
a
blockad
must
be
impos
over
a
period
of
time
but
the
royal
navi
doe
not
have
that
much
time
winter
is
come
on
in
the
south
atlant
and
the
british
suppli
line
are
overextend
have
come
thi
far
her
majesti
navi
can
not
simpli
drop
the
blockad
and
sail
away
in
a
few
week
time
without
draw
blood
from
argentina
a
a
result
the
british
will
be
forc
to
undertak
militari
oper
veri
soon
no
matter
how
riski
they
may
be
there
is
also
anoth
reason
whi
the
royal
navi
now
ha
no
choic
but
to
engag
the
argentin
forc
in

that
reason
my
friend
is
that
the

ha
alreadi
suffer
loss
in
secret
combat
thi
month
up
to
thi
moment
there
will
be
no
way
to
explain
away
the
damag
which
ha
been
sustain
by
the
british
fleet
onli
when
publicli
admit
fight
erupt
will
the
british
dare
to
admit
that
they
have
suffer
battl
loss
to
obtain
that
cover
stori
the
british
have
no
choic
but
to
sail
into
combat
but
in
do
so
they
will
be
risk
even
heavier
loss
on
top
of
those
alreadi
sustain
in
short
my

her

when

it
look
at
first
like
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
for
a
centuri
and
a
half
sinc
the
island
have
been
control
by
great
britain
dure
that
entir
time
british
sovereignti
over
the

ha
been
disput

there
have
been
countless
threat
by
argentina
to
seiz
the

which
it
call
the
malvina
but
the
threat
have
alway
come
to
noth
in
the
past
and
britain
ha
never
even
gotten
veri
worri
about
them
the
island
are
four
time
a

a
cuba

they
are
not
much

prize
after

the

watch
all
thi
a
lot
of
peopl
are
ask
what
thi
fight
realli
all
about
the
most
popular
answer
suggest
in
the
major
medium
is
oil
vast
deposit
of
oil
are
known
to
exist
under
the
continent
shelf
between
argentina
and
the
falkland
but
that
ha
been
known
for
nearli
year
in
no
way
doe
it
explain
the
time
of
the
sudden
militari
offens
by
argentina
thi
month
and
oil
explain
even
le
about
the
argentin
seizur
of
south
georgia
island
south
georgia
island
is
mile
east
of
the
falkland
with
no
known
oil
deposit
anywher
near
it
and
compar
to
south
georgia
the
falkland
are
an
island
paradis
south
georgia
island
is
cover
with
rug
mountain
treacher
valley
glacier
and
semiperman
snow
most
of
it
is
uninhabit
on
top
of
all
that
argentina
ha
absolut
no
legal
or
histor
claim
to
south
georgia
island
in
that
respect
it
stand
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
falkland
in
the
earli
s
the
falkland
were
occupi
for
a
while
by
argentin
colonist
in
the
british
expel
them
and
took
over
the
island
for
that
and
other
histor
reason
argentina
argu
that
the
falkland
realli
belong
to
argentina
not
britain
but
no
such
argument
is
possibl
for
south
georgia
island
it
ha
alway
been
control
by
britain
never
by
argentina
or
spain
the
argentin
seizur
of
south
georgia
island
look
even
more
unreason
from
a
militari
point
of
view
argentina
leader
are
militari
men
and
they
think
in
militari
term
they
were
well
awar
ahead
of
time
that
faroff
south
georgia
island
could
not
possibl
be
held
for
long
by
seiz
it
they
were
set
themselv
up
to
absorb
a
militari
defeat
a
the
island
wa
retaken
by
britain
so
the
question
is
whi
did
argentina
militari
junta
bother
with
the
seemingli
worthless
south
georgia
island
at
all
my
friend
the
answer
to
all
these
question
are
militari
not
polit
or
econom
south
georgia
island
posse
an
enorm
militari
secret
it
a
giant
underground
instal
buri
under
the
mountain
at
the
northwest
end
of
the

the
real
reason
for
the
socal
falkland
crisi
is
thi
secret
instal
togeth
with
two
other
similar
instal
which
i
will
describ

threat
that
caus
the
socal
falkland

now
what

are
work
togeth
in
a
race
against
time
to
tri
to
head
off
the
bolshevik
war
plan
last
month
i
mention
that
the
bolshevik
here
are
benefit
from
war
prepar
which
were
start
by
the
rockefel
long
ago
it
ha
onli
been
about
three
year
sinc
the
rockefel
were
dislodg
a
the
prime
mover
of
the

sinc
that
time
the

ha
been
a
hous
divid
torn

befor
that
the

launch
a

it
wa
a
twoprong
strategi
half
visibl
and
half
secret
which
i
first
describ
long

in

no
it
wa
a
plan
for
the
unit
state
to
arm
to
the
teeth
in
secret
while
appear
to
disarm
gradual
without
repeat
all
the
detail
the
basic
idea
wa
grandios
yet
simpl
by
deliber
appear
weak
the
rockefellercontrol
unit
state
would
maneuv
itself
into
a
nuclear
war
with
russia
then
the
secret
weapon
includ
superweapon
would
be

to
smash
russia
and
take
over
the
world
when
they
set
the
grand
plan
in

in
the
rockefel
brother
were
look
ahead
to
a
nuclear

by
the
late

their

analyst
conclud
veri
earli
that
the
war
be
plan
would
have
veri
differ
effect
on

both
superpow
the

by

the

target
for

in

are
rel
few
and
far
between
in

word
it
wa
expect
that
the
come
nuclear

would
be
essenti
a
northern

war
in

it
is
known
that

but
there
are
limit
to
how
far
the

cloud
can
spread
it
wa
discov
long

that
there
is

conclus
my
