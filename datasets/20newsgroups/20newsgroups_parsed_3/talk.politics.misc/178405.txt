thank

glad
to
be
here
q
there
are
a
lot
of
thing
wed
like
to
talk
about
in
the
brief
amount
of
time
we
have
but
some
news
is
just
break
from
lo
angel
i
guess
the
entir
countri
ha
been
kind
of
hold
their
breath
wonder
what
go
to
happen
in
the
trial
of
the
four
lo
angel
polic
offic
we
just
heard
that
two
of
those
offic
the
sergeant
sergeant
koon
and
offic
powel
have
been
found
guilti
and
two
offic
have
been
found
not
guilti
it
a
situat
that
been
build
for
over
a
year
sinc
the
first
trial
and
now
thi
trial
and
thi
verdict
and
i
wonder
what
your
thought
are
thi
morn
on
how
you
see
the
situat
in
lo
angel
in
connect
with
your
administr
and
what
your
tri
to
do
the
presid
well
first
of
all
i
think
the
american
peopl
should
know
that
thi
trial
in
my
judgment
is
a
tribut
to
the
work
and
judgment
of
the
juri
a
well
a
to
the
effort
of
the
feder
govern
in
develop
the
case
the
law
under
which
the
offic
were
tri
is
a
complex
one
the
standard
of
proof
are
complic
the
juri
decid
that
they
would
convict
the
sergeant
who
wa
respons
for
supervis
the
offic
and
the
offic
who
on
the
film
did
most
of
the
beat
the
juri
acquit
an
offic
who
kick
rodney
king
but
also
plainli
tri
to
shield
him
from
some
blow
and
anoth
offic
who
wa
a
rooki
no
one
know
exactli
whi
they
did
what
they
did
but
it
appear
that
they
realli
tri
to
do
justic
here
they
acknowledg
that
hi
civil
right
were
violat
and
i
think
that
the
american
peopl
should
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
that
but
i
hope
now
we
can
begin
to
look
ahead
and
focu
on
three
thing
first
of
all
the
import
of
tri
to
bring
thi
countri
togeth
and
not
violat
the
civil
right
of
ani
american
secondli
the
import
of
renew
our
fight
against
crime
i
think
it
import
to
recogn
that
in
the
poorest
area
of
lo
angel
and
mani
other
citi
in
thi
countri
peopl
may
be
worri
about
polic
abus
but
theyr
even
more
worri
about
crime
it
time
that
we
renew
our
effort
to
go
to
commun
polic
put
more
polic
offic
on
the
street
pa
the
bradi
bill
that
would
requir
a
wait
period
befor
peopl
could
buy
a
handgun
and
do
some
other
thing
to
reduc
the
vulner
of
our
peopl
to
violenc
and
drug
and
the
last
point
id
like
to
make
is
it
seem
to
me
that
we
have
got
to
reded
ourselv
to
the
econom
revit
of
our
citi
and
other
economicallydistress
area
if
you
just
think
about
it
if
everybodi
in
lo
angel
who
want
a
job
had
one
i
dont
think
wed
have
quit
a
mani
problem
a
we
do
and
i
laid
out
a
veri
ambiti
program
in
the
campaign
to
tri
to
bring
privat
invest
and
public
invest
to
bear
in
our
citi
i
have
dispatch
the
commerc
secretari
ron
brown
to
california
to
tri
to
come
up
with
some
strategi
for
that
state
becaus
it
our
biggest
state
with
our
highest
unemploy
rate
which
could
then
be
appli
around
the
countri
i
want
to
talk
to
him
and
to
the
attorney
gener
to
the
new
head
of
the
naacp
to
reverend
jackson
and
to
sever
other
peopl
and
then
ill
decid
where
to
go
from
here
with
regard
to
lo
angel
and
the
other
citi
of
the
countri
q
let
talk
about
what
bring
you
to
the
pittsburgh
area
today
there
have
been
i
guess
there
been
a
lot
of
discuss
on
capitol
hill
about
your
stimulu
packag
youv
been
lock
in
a
battl
with
the
gop
yesterday
a
you
said
earlier
in
your
radio
address
you
made
some
move
to
break
that
gridlock
what
bring
you
to
pittsburgh
in
particular
to
allegheni
counti
in
particular
to
pennsylvania
with
that
battl
the
presid
well
there
are
two
reason
first
of
all
pittsburgh
allegheni
counti
and
pennsylvania
support
me
in
the
last
elect
becaus
they
want
a
new
direct
in
econom
polici
we
have
pass
our
overal
econom
plan
it
give
the
countri
a
veri
differ
budget
for
the
next
five
year
than
weve
had
in
the
previou
we
reduc
the
deficit
and
at
the
same
time
increas
invest
in
job
and
educ
and
health
care
in
the
thing
that
will
make
u
a
stronger
countri
but
in
addit
to
that
i
ask
the
congress
in
the
short
run
to
spend
a
littl
more
money
a
modest
amount
of
money
to
creat
anoth
halfmillion
job
in
the
next
year
and
a
half
to
tri
to
cut
the
unemploy
rate
by
a
half
a
percent
but
also
to
tri
to
spark
job
creation
in
the
privat
sector
more
the
plan
pass
the
hous
it
ha
the
support
of
a
major
of
the
senat
at
the
present
time
all
the
republican
senat
a
a
bloc
are
filibust
the
bill
that
is
they
wont
let
it
come
to
a
vote
i
believ
that
senat
specter
would
like
to
vote
for
the
bill
and
i
believ
that
senat
dole
the
republican
leader
ha
put
a
lot
of
pressur
on
a
lot
of
the
republican
to
stay
hitch
and
theyr
all
say
that
thi
bill
increas
the
deficit
it
doesnt
thi
bill
is
well
below
the
spend
target
that
congress
approv
includ
the
republican
for
thi
year
thi
bill
is
paid
for
by
budget
cut
in
the
next
five
year
thi
bill
is
design
to
give
a
jumpstart
to
the
economi
and
i
must
say
a
lot
of
the
republican
senat
that
are
hold
it
up
when
mr
bush
wa
presid
vote
for
billion
of
dollar
of
emerg
spend
of
just
thi
kind
much
of
it
wa
total
unrel
to
creat
job
so
what
im
tri
to
do
is
to
break
thi
logjam
ive
held
out
an
oliv
branch
ive
offer
a
compromis
but
i
think
that
we
ought
to
tri
to
put
some
more
american
to
work
right
now
to
show
that
were
chang
the
direct
of
the
countri
and
that
the
purpos
of
the
bill
q
have
you
been
in
touch
with
senat
specter
or
hi
offic
late
the
presid
well
weve
been
tri
to
talk
regularli
to
through
my
white
hous
congression
liaison
oper
to
the
senat
that
we
think
are
open
to
thi
senat
specter
senat
damato
from
new
york
senat
jefford
from
vermont
senat
hatfield
from
oregon
and
five
or
six
other
whom
we
believ
know
we
need
more
job
in
thi
economi
and
know
that
we
are
pay
for
thi
with
budget
cut
over
the
life
of
the
budget
i
present
you
know
it
ha
a
lot
of
appeal
to
say
well
weve
got
a
big
deficit
we
shouldnt
increas
it
more
but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
pay
for
thi
with
budget
cut
in
the
whole
life
of
the
budget
over
the
next
few
year
and
more
importantli
we
have
thi
program
well
below
the
spend
target
that
congress
ha
alreadi
approv
for
thi
year
and
theyv
done
thi
for
year
with
the
republican
vote
for
it
mani
republican
vote
for
it
for
thing
that
werent
nearli
a
import
a
put
the
american
peopl
back
to
work
so
i
just
hope
that
thi
doesnt
becom
a
polit
issu
it
ought
to
just
be
about
the
peopl
of
thi
countri
and
the
need
for
job
q
i
have
some
question
from
peopl
who
support
you
and
some
peopl
who
are
skeptic
about
your
administr
it
ha
to
do
with
their
hope
and
also
with
their
fear
a
lot
of
peopl
who
support
you
and
vote
for
you
in
pennsylvania
i
think
some
of
them
are
now
say
were
glad
we
got
him
in
the
white
hous
but
now
look
at
thi
incred
process
he
ha
to
go
through
look
at
these
problem
look
at
thi
gridlock
and
theyr
begin
to
wonder
is
thi
go
to
work
can
you
pull
it
off
and
of
cours
your
skeptic
are
say
well
i
knew
it
wa
go
to
be
like
thi
the
presid
well
what
i
would
id
ask
peopl
first
of
all
to
rememb
that
we
are
frankli
move
veri
fast
the
budget
resolut
that
the
congress
pass
is
the
fastest
they
have
ever
pass
a
budget
resolut
ever
in
histori
set
out
the
next
fiveyear
budget
target
so
we
are
move
realli
rapidli
and
weve
got
them
work
on
polit
reform
welfar
reform
health
care
reform
a
whole
wide
rang
of
thing
but
it
a
big
oper
you
cant
expect
to
turn
it
around
overnight
it
took
year
to
produc
the
condit
which
led
to
the
victori
i
receiv
from
the
peopl
in
novemb
and
we
cant
turn
it
around
in
day
but
i
think

would
urg
the
peopl
not
to
get
discourag
were
not
go
to
win
everi

is
go
to
