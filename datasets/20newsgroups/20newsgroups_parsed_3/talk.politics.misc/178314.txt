i

someth
that
the

q
ha
rule
out
q
ha
rule
out
i
mean
will
the
presid
consid
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulo
again
the
work
group
have
not
present
thi
to
the
presid
they
have
look
at
a
wide
rang
of
option
i
suppos
that
if
an
argument
is
made
he
will
clearli
listen
to
it
that
doe
not
mean
he
ha
decid
to
do
it
q
can
we
put
thi
anoth
way
in
hi
answer
in
ohio
he
look
at
the
vat
in
term
of
restructur
the
whole
tax
system
under
those
that
wa
the
circumst
that
he
said
it
might
be
consid
at
some
futur
point
is
that
no
longer
the
case
or
is
that
the
onli
way
that
he
can
see
a
vat
emerg
mr
stephanopoulo
i
guess
im
not
sure
exactli
what
your
ask
q
he
talk
about
the
vat
in
the
context
of
a
restructur
tax
system
not
a
a
specif
way
to
financ
health
care
for
exampl
q
or
anyth
els
q
or
anyth
els
q
it
wa
alway
in
the
context
of
substitut
for
other
tax
at
a
time
of
a
dramat
overhaul
of
the
whole
tax
system
mr
stephanopoulo
right
q
ha
that
chang
too
q
is
that
still
hi
view
mr
stephanopoulo
i
havent
spoken
about
those
specif
comment
i
think
i
can
just
go
back
to
it
are
the
work
group
have
they
examin
the
possibl
of
a
vat
ye
they
have
q
certainli
were
look
at
a
vat
she
said
mr
stephanopoulo
they
have
examin
the
possibl
of
a
vat
ha
it
been
present
to
the
presid
ha
he
made
a
decis
no
he
ha
not
q
what
kind
of
a
deal
do
you
have
when
youv
got
the
presid
appoint
task
forc
obvious
not
oblivi
to
hi
rule
someth
out
except
in
the
context
of
some
huge
down
the
line
reform
go
ahead
on
it
own
and
consid
a
tax
which
he
ha
specif
rule
out
in
ani
context
other
than
much
later
and
then
go
ahead
and
announc
that
that
what
theyr
look
at
is
the
presid
concern
about
that
sort
of
thing
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
that
the
presid
concern
is
to
make
sure
he
get
the
best
health
care
propos
possibl
he
concern
with
make
sure
that
they
have
the
most
thorough
process
for
examin
all
the
possibl
altern
all
the
differ
altern
if
a
decis
is
made
to
go
forward
with
someth
like
that
it
certainli
someth
the
presid
will
explain
and
justifi
but
no
decis
ha
been
made
along
those
line
q
what
doe
it
mean
exactli
though
when
the
presid
rule
someth
out
doe
it
mean
it
can
get
back
on
the
tabl
later
if
a
more
persuas
argument
is
made
mr
stephanopoulo
that
just
that
indisput
true
if
you

at
the
same
time
he
ha
not
rule

now
when

the
argument
for
a
shortterm
tax
thi
year
and
he
wasnt

on
it
q
but
the
door
is
open
for
the
presid
to
reconsid
includ
thi
a
part
of
mr
stephanopoulo
obvious
the
work
group
are

make
a
present
on

of
the

to

mr

i
dont

that
i
assum
that
if
i
dont

what
stage
they
are

look
at
q
do

that
none
of

these
question
in
context
of
a
decis
that
the
presid
ha
made
onli
about
what
the
presid

i

that
and

issu
of
a
vat
q
and
the
presid
will
consid
it
mr
stephanopoulo

assum
that
he
will
consid
the
argument
if
it
is
present
to
him
q
doe
that
mean
the
presid
that
work
group
think
that
when
the
presid
say
no
he
mean
mayb
laughter
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
that
mean
that
the
work
group
are
tri
to
do
the
most
thorough
job
possibl
q
georg
can
i
ask
you
anoth
question
about
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulo
sure
laughter
q
no
he
want
u
to
stay
on
thi
q
let
do
gay
in
the
militari
laughter
q
no
he
got
out
of
that
swamp
q
i
think
weve
gotten
the
bottom
line
on
that
vat
reggi
bartholomew
your
special
ambassador
in
belgrad
today
said
that
if
the
serb
do
not
accept
the
agreement
that
ha
been
work
out
quot
we
will
do
our
part
to
pursu
the
lift
of
the
arm
embargo
togeth
with
our
alli
that
seem
to
go
a
bit
further
than
what
youv
just
said
mr
stephanopoulo
sound
almost
exactli
what
i
just
said
q
well
do
you
accept
in
other
word
you
accept
what
reggi
mr
stephanopoulo
well
the
presid
ha
said
that
thi
is
someth
that
under
consider
it
is
someth
he
will
consid
if
the
current
action
dont
bring
the
serb
to
the
tabl
q
isnt
there
some
kind
of
timet
here
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
there
is
a
timet
there
go
to
be
a
vote
on
the
un
resolut
in
about
day
q
that
on
sanction
that
on
tighten
the
sanction
mr
stephanopoulo
that
right
that
sanction
and
we
believ
that
that
will
ratchet
up
the
pressur
and
we
hope
that
that
will
bring
the
serb
to
the
tabl
a
you
know
mr
bartholomew
also
met
with
mr
churkin
of
russia
and
they
are
also
work
on
way
to
bring
the
serb
to
the
tabl
we
will
continu
to
pressur
them
in
mani
differ
way
and
thi
is
one
possibl
option
a
well
q
the
question
is
whether
there
a
timet
for
consider
or
a
vote
on
a
decis
on
lift
the
arm
embargo
not
the
sanction
mr
stephanopoulo
the
next
vote
in
the
un
is
on
sanction
a
far
a
i
know
there
are
no
vote
schedul
on
lift
the
arm
embargo
but
it
is
someth
that
we
have
discuss
both
intern
and
with
our
alli
q
whi
did
reggi
bartholomew
tell
the
serb
that
the
u
would
do
that
what
wa
the
point
of
hi
tell
them
that
mr
stephanopoulo
well
clearli
i
mean
thi
is
someth
that
under
consider
and
thi
is
someth
that
we
take
quit
serious
if
they
do
not
come
to
the
tabl
they
should
know
the
consequ
of
fail
to
come
to
the
tabl
q
have
they
been
given
a
deadlin
q
warren
christoph
ha
been
say
the
same
thing
and
it
hasnt
seem
to
chang
the
serb
behavior
in
the
least
whi
should
the
serb
take
ani
heed
of
a
threat
to
lift
the
arm
embargo
when
so
far
everyth
that
been
done
ha
had
no
effect
on
the
fight
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulo
i
just
dont
accept
the
premis
of
your
question
it
ha
had
an
effect
the
embargo
is
have
an
effect
q
what
effect
mr
stephanopoulo
if
the
serbian
choos
not
to
heed
our
warn
then
they
will
face
the
consequ
q
what
effect
ha
it
had
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulo
well
the
effect
that
it
ha
had
on
the
serbian
it
ha
tighten
up
they
are
not
get
their
shipment
through
we
can
brief
more
fulli
q
in
bosnia
georg
in
bosnia
what
effect
ha
it
had
mr
stephanopoulo
well
it
hard
to
say
if
it
stop
the
aggress
to
date
that
is
whi
were
continu
to
press
for
the
serbian
to
stop
but
we
believ
that
over
time
we
will
continu
to
weaken
the
serb
and
that
will
have
an
effect
im
not
say
it
go
to
happen
overnight
it
clearli
hasnt
happen
overnight
but
we
believ
that
over
time
the
sanction
can
weaken
the
serb
if
it
fail
to
work
and
if
the
serb
fail
to
come
to
the
negoti
tabl
well
move
forward
with
the
embargo
q
isnt
there
a
work
deadlin
georg
of
the
th
the
same
date
a
the
un
the
schedul
un
vote
hasnt
the
unit
state
said
along
with
mani
of
the
other
nato
alli
that
if
the
serb
arent
will
to
sign
on
to
the
peac
accord
by
then
that
well
seek
havent
we
said
that
we
will
seek
mr
stephanopoulo
weve
said
continu
were
go
to
q
but
on
that
deadlin
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
have
a
specif
date
but
were
go
to
move
forward
with
the
resolut
the
un
resolut
by
around
that
time
and
if
that
fail
to
take
effect
if
that
fail
to
bring
the
serb
to
the
tabl
we
will
clearli
consid
other
action
q
isnt
thi
aw
increment
mr
stephanopoulo
were
take
a
stepbystep
approach
were
ratchet
up
the
pressur
and
were
go
to
continu
to
do
that
q
is
there
a
possibl
georg
that
by
the
time
all
these
increment
step
are
taken
the
serb
will
have
achiev
their
goal
and
then
what
the
purpos
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
the
purpos
is
to
get
the
serb
to
stop
the
aggress
we
are
pursu
that
goal
on
mani
differ
front
we
are
pursu
it
through
the
un
were
pursu
it
through
direct
talk
we
are
pursu
it
through
tighten
the
sanction
and
we
will
consid
lift
the
arm
embargo
we
are
turn
the
screw
up
on
the
serb
and
we
will
continu
to
do
that
q
but
if
the
effort
have
been
unsuccess
in
get
the
serb
to
stop
the
aggress
how
effect
will
ani
campaign
be
to
have
the
serb
give
back
what
theyv
gain
i
mean
onc
theyr
entrench
mr
stephanopoulo
i
cant
specul
on
that
were
go
to
continu
to
press
for
them
to
come
to
the
tabl
now
were
go
to
continu
to
find
way
to
stop
the
aggress
but
i
cant
see
into
the
futur
q
georg

have
is
the
one

summer
job
program
a
quot
a
reaffirm
of
a
promis
of

promis
of
america
to
give

a
chanc
to
reach
their
full
potenti
q
governmentfund
job
mr
stephanopoulo
to
give
peopl
a
chanc
to
work
absolut
that
is
the
promis
of
america
q
i
want
to
follow
up
on
someth
i
ask
yesterday
where
doe
summer
job
where
doe
that
figur
come
from
mr
stephanopoulo
that
is
on
top
of
i
did
look
at
it
there
are
current
summer
job
in
the
pipelin
thi
will
be
on
top
of
the
so
it
will
be
a
total
of
million
q
the
would
be
creat
by
the
stimulu
packag
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
q
where
doe
that
number
come
from
becaus
weve
been
told
all
along
that
the
stimulu
packag
would
creat
new
job
and
accord
to
panetta
that
break
down
to
someth
like
fulltim
job
and
summer
job
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
but
the
summer
that
when
you
do
their
fulltim
equival
i
mean
individu
will
receiv
job
thi
summer
when
you
calcul
it
for
the
fulltim
job
effect
you
have
to
do
i
dont
know
what
the
exact
formula
is
q
seven
hundr
thousand
parttim
job
mr
stephanopoulo
or
q
one
to
four
becaus
it
three
month
mr
stephanopoulo
thank
you
q
can
i
follow
up
on
that
did
the
presid
misspeak
thi
morn
when
he
said
that
some
of
the
govern
money
for
these
summer
job
will
pay
for
privat
for
kid
to
work
in
the
privat
sector
mr
stephanopoulo
not
necessarili
i
mean
i
think
that
there
will
be
grant
avail
that
one
of
the
way
that
you
pay
for
the
job
at
the
same
time
he
also
issu
a
challeng
to
the
privat
sector
to
hire
kid
on
their
own
a
well
q
tax
dollar
for
instanc
would
pay
for
kid
to
work
at
timewarn
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
the
timewarn
is
actual
somebodi
come
forward
and
actual
do
a
grant
that
go
to
be
the
bulk
of
it
there
could
be
isol
instanc
though
where
there
would
be
grant
to
busi
q
ha
the

with
ani
senat
republican
thi

mr
stephanopoulo
no
but
there
been
a
lot
of
contact
with
senat
republican
in
the
white
hous
q
at
a
lower
level
but
the
presid
hasnt
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
ha
not
no
q
get
ani
closer
to
get
the

attitud
toward

leader
can
you
confirm
that
there
ha
been
thi
chang
and
what

will
it
have
on

brief
the

i
cant

believ
we
can
q
and

of

word
mr
stephanopoulo

i
know
that
we
can
do
it
by
summer
job
and
other
job
i
dont
know
how
deepli
it
can
be
broken
down
but
clearli
we
can
break
it
down
into
summer
job
and
other
job
q
and
can
i
follow
up
is
thi
the
inform
that
jeff
eller

the
rest
of
the
white

in
the

theyr
press

q
can
you
describ
what
those
press

do
is
point
out

packag
to
variou
state
for
instanc
i
know
that
today
senat
dole
is
head
up
to
vermont
and
new
hampshir
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
stimulu
packag
the
job
packag

job
in
vermont
it
creat
job
in
new
hampshir
and
the
peopl
of

that
thi
is
import
q
where
are
the
releas

mr
stephanopoulo
they
go
to
the
state
q

whom
mr

we
can
get
them
it
no
problem
q
can
we
get
it
q
whi
dont
you
put
them
out
here
a
well
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
we
can
q
thi
afternoon
would
that
be
possibl
mr
stephanopoulo
ill
have
to
check
i
dont
know
but
a
soon
a
we
can
q
are
you
focus
these
press
releas
on
state
where
there
are
moder
or
pragmat
republican
senat
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
were
tri
to
get
a
mani
a
we
can
it
actual
quit
difficult
to
pull
thi
togeth
and
were
do
our
best
were
put
them
out
a
we
get
them
q
whi
are
you
so
close
track
senat
dole
schedul
mr
stephanopoulo
i
wa
just
follow
it
q
are
press
releas
go
along
to
state
where
he
visit
mr
stephanopoulo
im
not
sure
i
think
that
probabl
there
are
press
releas
go
to
vermont
laughter
q
will
there
be
a
man
in
a
chicken
suit
wait
laughter
q
georg
a
the
presid
go
about
the
busi
of
defend
what
in
hi
stimulu
packag
he
doesnt
address
what
seem
to
be
the
republican
main
point
that
your
fund
it
with
deficit
spend
rather
than
if
it
so
import
whi
not
come
up
with
the
fund
for
it
seem
to
be
the
republican
argument
and
how
do
you
answer
that
mr
stephanopoulo
what
wa
answer
is
we
are
pay
for
it
over
time
and
if
you
look
at
our
budget
we
pay
for
thi
packag
over
time
we
believ
right
now
the
economi
need
a
jump
start
for
job
q
your
not
claim
are
you
that
that
doesnt
add
to
the
deficit
thi
year
mr
stephanopoulo
im
say
were
pay
for
it
over
time
i
didnt
say
that
q
i
know
that
georg
but
i
mean
from
the
begin
the
question
we
do
have
annual
budget
and
thing
deficit
spend
will
pay
for
that
thi
year
will
it
not
mr
stephanopoulo
thi
year
they
clearli
will
but
over
time
our
budget
fulli
pay
for
thi
program
q
what
your
say
is
that
there
are
save
that
would
cover
thi
if
it
were
thi
year
in
futur
year
mr
stephanopoulo
absolut
that
exactli
what
i
said
q
i
know
that
but
there
is
go
to
be
outstand
debt
it
will
add
to
the
nation
debt
from
thi
year
mr
stephanopoulo
no
were
reduc
the
deficit
by
billion
billion
over
the
next
four
year
q
you
mean
your
reduc
it
below
what
it
would
have
been
mr
stephanopoulo
exactli
q
in
fact
your
ad
a
veri
larg
amount
to
the
nation
debt
over
the
period
of
mr
stephanopoulo
but
were
reduc
it
far
more
from
what
it
would
have
been
that
true
q
washingtontyp
reduct
laughter
q
your
get
to
be
a
grumpi
old

i
dont
know
about
that
it
a
littl
far
out
but
i
believ
he
go
to
be
in
the
senat
retreat
q
so
will
he
have
the
leader
in
a
day
or
two
befor

point
he
would
meet
with
the
leader
of
some
of
these
group
i
dont
know
the
schedul
on

though
q
will
there
be
an
aid
czar
appoint
prior
to

about
the
same
it
about
the
same
pace
of
presid
bush
obvious
a
you
move
along
farther
onc
you
each
level
of
appoint
actual
ha
a
multipli
effect
and
free
up
far
more
appoint
so
we
expect
the
process
to
speed
up
but
were
at
the
pace
of
bush
obvious
wed
like
to
get
these
done
a
quickli
a
possibl
i
would
point
out
that
the
fbi
background
check
and
the
background
check
is
far
more
comprehens
and
it
take
more
time
than
our
predecessor

that
is
part
of
the
holdup

were
work
on
it
q

i
mean

a
democrat
senat
mr
