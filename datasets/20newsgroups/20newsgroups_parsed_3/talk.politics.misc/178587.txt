so
a
note
in
anoth
thread
limit
govt
the
problem
libertarian
face
is
insur
that
the
limit
govern
they
seek
doe
not
becom
the
tool
of
privat
interest
to
pursu
their
own
agenda
it
is
a
failur
of
libertarian
if
the
ideolog
doe
not
provid
ani
reason
way
to
restrain
such
action
other
than
utopian
dream
just
a
marxism
fail
to
specifi
how
pure
commun
is
to
be
achiev
and
the
state
is
to
wither
away
libertarian
frequent
fail
to
show
how
weaken
the
power
of

resel
car
either
youv
gotten
good
enough
at
it
in
your
spare
time
to
bump
up
against
these
limit
or
you
would
like
to
do
it
fulltim
but
these
stupid
arbitrari
law
prevent
you
from
start
out
small
and
pull
yourself
up
so
im
protect
from
a
hungri
neighborhood
competitor
will
to
take
a
low
profit
while
work
extra
hard
to
fulfil
my
need
and
your
protect
from
do
what
you
want
with
your
life

what
i
see
libertarian
offer
you
your
money

truli
your
it
belong
to
you
you
can
use
it
to
buy
a
car
if

it
to
buy
a
car
it
is
truli
your
car
it
belong
to
you
you
can
use
your
money
to
fix
up
that
car
sinc
it
is
your
car
you
can
sell
that
car
your
life
is
truli
your
it
belong
to
you
it
matter
not
if
someon
think
that
it
wrong
for
you
to
buy
and
sell
car
within
month
rather
than
say
car
they
may
dissaprov
but
it
is
not
their
life
or
their
money
it
is
your
life
and
your
money
my
money

perhap
that
th
car
the
one
that
someon
somewher

that
someon
could
go
to
the
govern
and
insist
that
the
govern
make
u
stop
it
but
the
govern
would
be
powerless
to
stop
u
from
do
what
we
like
with
our
own
properti
in
the
abscenc
of
fraud
or
agress
and
it
would
be
powerless
to
stop
u
from
associ
with
each
other
thi
doe
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
utopian
dream
but
basic
human
decenc
and
common
sen
a
real
grassroot
exampl
of
freedom
and
liberti
and
ye
not
have
a
few
peopl
act
a
our
master
approv
or
reject
each
of
our
basic
transact
with
each
other
doe
strike
me
a
a
wonder
way
to
improv
the
human
condit
thank
