thank
to

for

i
wa
hope
that
someon
would
bring
up
the
issu
of
cost
compens
the
problem
with
the
argument
is
that
it
fail
to
explain
whi
kidney
dialysi
rd
servic
have
expand
massiv
in
the
last
decad
after
all
no
one
is
forc
privat
provid
to
offer
thi
servic
if
they
are
lose
money
on
the
treatment
which
accord
to
inform
ive
collect
from
sever
provid
they
are
not
whi
would
they
not
simpli
limit
their
loss
by
cut
back
on
servic
engag
in
effect
ration
of
suppli
rather
than
expand
the
coverag
to
a
larger
market
that
must
then
be
compens
by
rais
price
in
other
area
perhap
there
is
a
competit
advantag
in
there
after
all
would
not
reput
and
dedic
physician
prefer
to
affili
with
an
institut
that
offer
dialysi
servic
would
they
not
therefor
tend
to
admit
patient
in
greater
number
to
an
institut
that
offer
a
full
rang
of
diagnost
and
treatment
option
undoubtedli
in
fact
it
is
the
fact
that
hospit
frequent
compet
for
physician
rather
than
for
patient
that
in
part
complic
and
undermin
a
simplist
freemarket
analysi
of
the
market
for
medic
care
hospit
tend
to
lose
money
on
all
sort
of
hightech
highpric
machineri
they
manag
to
make
it
up
on
other
charg
onc
again
there
is
no
evid
that
thi
is
true
in
regard
to
kidney
dialysi
although
price
control
have
promot
an
expans
of
servic
to
a
much
greater
volum
of
patient
rd
is
still
a
profit
servic
otherwis
one
would
expect
to
see
evid
of
ration
rather
than
the
vast
expans
that
ha
occur
rememb
the
notion
that
you
can
lose
a
littl
on
each
treatment
but
make
it
up
in
volum
is
not
good
econom
even
in
a
free
market
then
how
do
you
explain
whi
groceri
store
routin
offer
an
array
of
product
at
price
below
cost
are
not
groceri
store
embed
in
a
rel
free
market
can
you
spell
loss
leader
i
knew
you
could
groceri
store
do
not
attempt
to
make
up
the
loss
on
an
individu
product
by
sell
more
of
it
in
fact
your
argument
abov
is
that
kidney
dialysi
is
a
loss
leader
for
other
medic
treatment
where
lost
revenu
can
be
regain
but
the
evid
doe
not
support
thi
content
rather
it
appear
that
price
control
have
disciplin
the
market
by
forc
an
expans
of
servic
and
develop

than
they
would

if
the

at

is
no

that
