insur
then
whi
do

then
wouldnt
it
just
make
more
sen
to
find
some
way
to
cut
down
on
the
cost
of
malpractic
insur
and
mayb
that
not
such
a
good
thing
i

read
somewher
that
it
is
next
to
imposs
in

to
litig
against
the
health
systemclass
action
suit
are
nearli
imposs
and
you
cant
sue
the
provinci
health
offici
at
all
part
of
the
deal
for
use
the
allinsur
approach
like
the
french
and
german
do
hey
whi
dont
they
critic
franc
and
germani
is
it
becaus
too
mani
peopl
take
french
and
german
in
colleg
to
make
the
accus
stick
wa
to
preserv
the
doctor
independ
sinc
the
provinci
wing
of
the
cma
are
the
one
that
go
to
bat
when
the
fee
schedul
hike
are
present
the
politicallyb
doctor
were
just
cackl
when
they
realiz
the
cma
would
grow
in
strength
rather
than
diminish
especi
when
unoppos
unlik
in
social
medicin
approach
like
britain
nation
health
servic
oh
no
dont
let
the
ama
know
about
thi
they
have
enough
power
a
it
is
ask
most
american
whether
theyd
like
the
doctor
lobbi
to
get
more
power
for
nonlif
threaten
thing
market
argument
adequ
cover
whi
certain
procedur
are
in
scarcer
demand
i
have
md
friend
who
cant
make
a
live
a
specialist
back
in
manitoba
not
due
to
the
insur
rate
but
becaus
they
wont
get
enough
custom
the
cma
medic
monopoli
grip
on
doctor
licenc
a
in
the
u
asid
so
they
must
move
to
larger
place
howev
thi
doe
not
refut
debunk
of
wait
line
for
urgent
and
routin
care
a
ha
been
done
in
the
u
by
consum
report
health
polici
studi
cite
by
prof
denni
e
shea
on
usenet
cnn
nyt
etc
well
yeah
tell
u
about
the
nation
defens
medic
centr
outsid
ottawa
theoret
it
limit
to
servic
personnel
but
some
studi
ive
heard
about
have
suggest
that
about
half
the
patient
there
are
civilian
who
not
onli
have
connect
but
arent
urgent
at
all
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospit
annual
budget
are
approv
by
the
govern
how
do
you
keep
polit
consider
out
of
medic
decis
i
bet
that
if
your
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friend
with
one
your
put
on
ani
hospit
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
your
someon
who
get
bump
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
wouldnt
nation
health
insur
mean
that
american
who
are
now
fulli
insur
might
have
to
settl
for
le
in
canada
provinci
insur
cover
all
health
cost
except
dental
care
eyeglass
prescript
drug
ambul
servic
and
privat
hospit
room
so
mani
canadian
do
end
up
buy
some
privat
insur
a
polici
to
cover
all
of
these
thing
run
about
to
a
month
hmm
how
much
differ
would
it
make
in
the
figur
of
percentag
of
gnp
spent
on
health
care
if
dentistri
and
optometri
were
includ
in
the
account
mayb
canada
spend
proportion
just
a
much
on
health
care
a
we
do
of
cours
the
one
thing
to
note
is
that
in
the
canadafrancegermani
case
privat
insur
offload
the
basic
coverag
to
the
public
sector
they
realiz
they
were
keep
lowriskhighprofit
extra
insur
for
thing
like
privatesemipriv
room
v
ward
accomod
dental
glass
etc
for
corpor
or
person
benefit
theyll
have
noth
to
do
with
you
if
you
want
to
be
cover
for
basic
care
at
that
point
they
wouldnt
even
consid
a
voucher
approach
to
broker
the
univers
coverag
and
sell
polici
to
make
up
the
differ
in
the
feder
guidelin
and
market
stuff
so
what
happen
if
the
health
care
system
financi
collaps
bob
rae
the
second
least
popular
man
in
ontario
warn
ontarian
a
few
year
ago
that
if
they
didnt
stop
crossbord
shop
in
such
huge
number
the
servic
they
expect
from
the
provinc
just
wont
be
there
in
a
few
year
fortun
for
them
and
le
fortun
for
the
retail
here
in
western
new
york
the
canadian
dollar
went
back
to
a
more
realist
valu
he
didnt
say
so
but
i
knew
he
meant
the
ohip
what
would
happen
if
hi
warn
turn
out
to
be
the
truth
would
the
privat
insur
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
oblig
to
of
cours
they
could
eventu
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loath
to
do
so
and
out
of
practic
in
handl
such
basic
servic
too
wouldnt
free
care
encourag
peopl
to
run
to
the
doctor
for
everi
ach
and
pain
peopl
who
get
free
treatment
do
go
to
the
doctor
and
hospit
about
a
third
more
often
than
those
who
have
to
pay
a
share
of
their
medic
bill
still
canadian
who
pay
noth
at
the
doctor
have
a
lower
perperson
health
bill
than
we
do
it
is
free
in
that
there
are
no
deduct
nor
copay
two
thing
which
i
advoc
to
make
the
canadian
insur
look
more
like
real
health
insur
which
actual
it
is
i
know
that
when
work
in
alberta
ontario
and
quebec
i
wa
awar
that
i
wa
pay
for
health
insur
eg
in
toronto
ohip
fee
were
list
on
my
pay
stub
manitoba
did
not
collect
at
paychequ
time
but
onli
annual
at
incom
tax
time
built
into
the
tax
rate
onli
fiscal
naif
will
proclaim
that
it
free
along
with
the
canadian
left
for
that
is
part
of
their
brainwash
agenda
would
that
it
were
free
american
would
start
anoth
revolut
if
they
had
to
pay
tax
at
canadian
rate
isnt
the
privat
health
insur
industri
just
too
big
and
power
to
kill
dismantl
the
health
segment
of
our
insur
industri
would
be
polit
thorni
in
the
quiet
word
of
one
advoc
for
a
nation
plan
some
firm
now
sell
more
than
billion
in
health
insur
theyd
put
up
a
hard
fight
not
onli
ha
the
industri
grown
eightfold
sinc
canada
shut
down
it
own
health
insur
but
our
govern
leav
politician
more
open
to
lobbyist
than
doe
canada
parliamentari
system
health
insur
doe
exist
in
canada
and
in
western
europ
it
just
that
it
doesnt
cover
basic
care
you
can
opt
out
in
canada
and
germani
but
youll
have
to
go
uninsur
a
a
result
becaus
there
are
too
few
other
peopl
that
do
so
ie
no
market
when
privat
insur
realiz
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risk
involv
in
basic
insur
eg
neurosurgeri
versu
delux
amen
eg
have
to
call
granada
tv
to
replac
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someon
privat
hospit
room
they
start
to
pat
themselv
on
the
back
for
their
social
respons
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
privat
insur
publicli
warn
against
ani
thought
of
privat
routin
low
cost
part
of
that
provinc
public
health
insur
plan
again
i
doubt
american
would
like
give
the
insur
compani
that
much
power
i
half
wonder
if
the
canadian
health
insur
didnt
go
along
with
the
provinc
and
the
feder
govern
year
ago
becaus
they
knew
that
there
wa
a
good
chanc
of
the
public
system
go
bust
in
the
long
run
and
then
afterward
they
could
clean
up
okay
thi
sort
of
contradict
what
i
said
higher
up
but
it
anoth
possibl
theyd
have
an
ad
bonu
when
argu
against
govern
involv
in
their
industrya
they
could
then
point
to
it
failur
instead
of
just
cite
