than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
hous
of
repres
wa
also
in
fact
they
both
were
becaus
the
british
govern
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
in
principl
no
in

ye
in

of
that
they
should
have
had
le

the
british
parliament
in

ha
absolut

so
doe
the

much
of
the
stabil
of
the

rest
on
what
is
not
defin
clearli
in
the
case
of
a

abus
by

the

the

can

the

two
institut
with

cute
let
talk
practic
shall
we
if
the
monarch
tri
to
do
someth
what
would
happen
if
they
were
to
start
from
a
social
welfar
model
instead
of
the
current
no
state
subsidi
motto
they
would
be
better
place
a
it
is
there
is
plenti
of
state
money
be
hand
out
the
problem
is
that
it
is
distribut
on
the
basi
of
power
in
congress
and
not
on
the
basi
of
actual
need
bingo
the
higher
up
the
government
ladder
the
le
actual
need
matter
becaus
polit
power
can
be
concentr
at
higher
level
while
peopl
with
le
cloud
onli
find
themselv
reduc
to
in
effect
that
wa
not
my
point
but
you
illustr
the
problem
veri
well
in
order
to
set
up
a
school
project
in
new
york
state
you
have
to
pay
off
the
other
state
with
pork
defens
contract
agricultur
subsidi
etc
or
to
be
precis
of
the
state
sinc
you
need
to
beat
the
filibust
then
whi
not
simpli
leav
new
york
educ
to
new
york
i
remain
unconcinv
that
there
is
ani
state
in
the
union
which
is
not
capabl
of
educ
it
own
child
if
that
what
they
want
to
do
the
point
is
of
redistribut
of
cash
from
the
poor
area
of
the
ecconomi
to
the
rich
one
i
am
contend
that
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
which
doe
not
have
ampl
wealth
if
they
choos
to
spend
it
to
run
a
perfectli
accept
educ
system
i
further
contend
that
the
amount
of
money
be
spent
now
is
more
then
suffici
but
is
be
spent
badli
or
vice
versa
if
you
arent
a
republican
so
tell
me
phill
were
the
republican
also
respons
for
some
of
the
huge
increas
in
social
program
or
were
they
onli
respons
for
what
you
dont
like
i
contend
it
is
congress
which
is
to
blame
democrat
and
republican
alik
if
societi
simpli
write
off
ani
area
of
the
countri
that
is
ecconom
weak
you
end
up
with
a
basket
case
ecconomi
there
are
inevit
cycl
in
ani
busi
some
of
these
act
in
phase
to
produc
the
busi
cycl
other
are
countercycl
local
can
experi
boom
to
bust
cycl
outsid
the
nation
trend
to
produc
a
strong
ecconomi
you
need
to
ensur
that
the
bust
area
do
not
fall
bellow
the
level
where
they
can
not
be
ecconom
rebuilt
most
of
our
worst
area
are
still
better
off
than
most
of
europ
in
ani
case
were
talk
about
educ
if
the
industri
in
an
area
collaps
the
u
a
a
whole
still
ha
a
respons
to
ensur
that
the
child
in
that
area
get
a
good
educ
in
some
area
of
the
u
school
are
close
halfway
through

for
lack

ye
i
live
in

your
woefulli
ignor
of

some

reduc
tax
which
paid
into

i
dont
know
about
the
rest
of
the
countri
but
our
educ
problem
stem
directli
from
two
problem
neither
of
which
are
a
lack
of
money
in
the
state
btw
tennesse
is
consid
a
tax
heaven
and
our
economi
is
one
of
the
strongest
in

some
of
the
most

program
get

like
state
fund
for
new

in
the
counti
seat
while
school
are
close
it
not
a
lack

it
an
unwilling
to
spend
them
on
what
is
more
appropri
educ
is
the
parent
hotbutton
educ
is
alway
the
first
to

cut
becaus
it
easier
to
get

the

the
highbrow

there
are
a
coupl

though
such
a
the
reason
for

the
reason
for

both
in
articl
i
section
the
declar
on

cam
a
decad
earlier
and
ha
not
a
line
of
justif
for
the
u
constitut
you
could
argu
that
it
went
into
the
broad
concept
but
littl
more
it
spoke
veri
eloqu
on
govern
be
base
on
the
consent
of
the
govern
in
fact
it
is
littl
more
than
a
protract
whing
more
to
do
with
the
price
of
tea
than
the
design
of
a
govern
it
would
be
a
pretti
daft
idea
for
a
bunch
of
guy
to
sit
arround
design
the
structur
of
the
new
govern
while
the
littl
matter
of
the
british
armi
remain
to
be
settl
they
did
it
anyway
the
continent
congress
had
it
own
set
of
bylaw
it
wasnt
quit
a
govern
but
a
mean
of
make
decis
had
to
be
creat
howev
low
georg
washington
opinion
of
them
were
to
a
certain
extend
i
do
believ
the
veto
ha
becom
someth
it
wasnt
intend
howev
i
also
believ
it
is
inevit
consid
the
congress
own
abus
of
their
power
to
make
bill
say
whatev
they
want
them
to
say
unlik
most
peopl
i
think
we
shouldnt
be
worri
about
the
veto
which
is
fine
but
of
the
problem
in
congress
which
almost
necessit
it
abus
the
congress
is
the
most
democrat
bodi
in
the
whole
system
allow
me
again
to
speak
heresi
against
the
holi
democrat
order
so
what
the
govern
wa
built
with
a
veri
nondemocrat
presid
with
fairli
broad
power
includ
the
veto
it
ha
not
onli
the
fairest
system
of
elect
but
the
two
year
term
mean
that
the
member
have
alway
got
a
recent
mandat
ye
and
the
senat
wa
intend
to
act
a
a
balanc
to
thi
too
much
democraci
wa
intent
avoid
it
wa
consid
a
good
thing
to
place
nondemocrat
block
to
impuls
action
on
the
other
hand
if
the
period
of
elect
were
to
be
made
year
in
antiphas
to
the
presidenti
cycl
there
would
be
much
le
depend
on
fund
rais
from
special
interest
than
there
is
at
present
so
long
a
congress
ha
someth
to
sell
peopl
will
pay
for
it
most
congressman
rake
in
more
money
than
they
need
whi
not
what
is
inher
wrong
with
bias
the
system
against
action
histor
governemnt
action
in
the
u
when
deal
with
issu
with
a
bare
minor
and
a
larg
minor
have
not
been
success
when
your
in
a
posit
of
impos
feder
power
on
divers
peopl
whi
should
the
feder
govern
not
have
to
got
through
someth
more
than
a
bare
major
in
other
word
david
think
that
the
reactionari
should
need
onli
vote
while
progress
should
need
no
if
the
progress
dont
want
the
reactionari
to
move
backward
they
get
the
same
benefit
of
the
state
is
a
lot
of
peopl
and
histor
law
with
that
sort
of
minor
arent
veri
effect
especi
sinc
it
is
usual
geograph
concentr
when
wield
the
feder
big
stick
i
dont
see
whi
they
shouldnt
have
to
make
a
better
argument
than
more
peopl
than
not
agre
now
we
know
whi
nobodi
call
the
republican
democrat
im
not
a

im
a

neither
a

now
ive

all
youv

which
i

befor
i
said

we
dont
