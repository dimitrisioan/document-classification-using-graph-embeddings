peopl
here
after
all
sue
health

compani
all
the
time
i
heard
about
a
guy
in
alberta
who
came
down
with
some
rare
eye
diseas
that
he
had
to
take
repeat
trip
to

and
hi

someth
like
and
the

later
still
ha
onli
reimburs
them
for

so
well
what
american
privat
insur
plan
cover
travel
expens
sinc
our
public

beyond
which
one
is
entitl
hey
not
alberta
fault
that
he
life
there
if
he
live
in
cheyenn
wy
hi
privat
insur
wouldv
told
him
to
go
to
hell
for
the
travel
expens
and
that
that
an

would
have
just
kept
quiet
and
let
him
go
blind
well
yeah
tell

about
the
nation
defens
medic

outsid
ottawa
it
serf
the
same
purpos
a
the
bethesda
naval

sinc
not
all
hospit
can
provid
everyth
mayb
they
have
some
stuff
that
other
dont
ottawa
popul
is
onli
a
quarter
million
if
you
includ
the
surround
counti
my
point
wa
that
someth
that
should
necessarili
remain
unpolitic
ha
becom
veri
politic
to
the
detriment
of
it
mission
i
dont
think
that
thi
ha
been
shown
with
the
dmc
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospit
annual
budget
are
approv
by
the
govern
how
do
you
keep
polit
consider
out
of
medic
decis
i
bet
that
if
your
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friend
with
one
your
put
on
ani
hospit
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
your
someon
who
get
bump
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
peopl
of
influenc
will
get
their
way
in
ani
system
american
or
european
it
the
golden
rule
he
who
ha
the
gold
make
the
rule
but
to
what
extent
doe
it
affect
the
system
and
whi
is
an
urgent
care
list
necessari
in
the
first
place
it
worth
think
about
it
regular
practic
in
a
hospit
to
figur
out
who
need
to
get
at
what
facil
dont
american
have
to
arrang
in
advanc
for
oper
too
i
think
that
there
are
two
standard
be
appli
here
and
that
canada
cant
give
beverli
hillsstyl
treatment
to
everybodi
it
not
a
big
brother
list
it
more
like
call
around
town
for
a
tabl
for
dinner
yeah
but
privat
nonprofit
foundat
have
to
make
money
somehow
especi
in
the
hospit
busi
ye
and
the
tori
in
ottawa
are
tri
to
make
them
do
that
rather
than
hope
for
a
bigger
grant
from
the
fed
and
their
provinc
the
next
time
around
whether
it
use
mop
a
coupl
of
week
longer
or
even
sell
servic
to
american
rememb
our
system
is
cash
base
and
sinc
our
health
care
infrastructur
is
overbuilt
except
in
specialti
that
requir
larger
popul
to
gener
busi
whi
not
the
altern
is
close
unus
ward
busi
whether
canadian
would
be
thrill
at
the
prospect
of
their
own
health
servic
cater
toward
american
who
would
be
will
to
pay
more
than
they
do
is
anoth
issu
entir
it
must
be
note
that
they
said
they
were
do
it
partli
becaus
their
grant
from
the
provinc
were
get
smaller
if
those
grant
are
so
insubstanti
whi
the
need
to
attract
foreign
to
make
up
the
differ
you
answer
the
question
yourself
privat
nonprofit
foundat
have
to
make
money
somehow
and
i
think
that
it
about
time
that
they
act
like
the
privat
hospit
that
they
are
person
im
fed
up
with
canadian
socialist
tri
to
tell
everyon
that
their
health
care
is
free
when
we
are
actual
buy
insur
that
one
at
you
bob
rae
the
gdp
figur
are
combin
public
and
privat
expenditur
for
total
outlay
and
are
compil
use
the
same
method
by
the
oecd
that
yield
the
figur
for
the
u
but
dont
the
u
figur
includ
dentistri
and
optometri
where
the
canadian
one
until
recent
anyway
didnt
sinc
we
have
alway
been
evalu
in
an
oecd
style
i
dont
see
how
rememb
oecd
count
both
privat
and
public
fund
and
in
canada
like
franc
and
germani
of
health
care
spend
is
privat
fund
ie
not
the
basic
health
insur
money
so
what
happen
if
the
health
care
system
financi
collaps
how
they
are
collect
premium
and
im
an
advoc
of
have
copay
like
the
french
do
in
their
system
well
if
you
spend
more
than
you
take
in
you
go
bankrupt
it
that
simpl
if
the
provinci
insur
system
find
themselv
pay
out
more
than
they
get
in
revenu
they
wont
be
abl
to
pay
for
everybodi
primari
care
ye
the
infrastructur
will
be
there
but
will
everybodi
be
abl
to
continu
use
it
at
the
same
rate
minor
copay
can
flush
out
abus
rememb
that
our
system
is
onli
an
insur
polici
but
our
cost
arent
rise
fast
enough
to
ensur
adequ
copaymentsdeduct
last
year
quebec
userfe
propos
came
out
with
the
number
of
a
the
necessari
hike
that
could
be
done
through
a
copay
rather
than
give
the
qma
a
rais
and
it
not
contract
time
yet
a
far
a
i
can
tell
from
upi
clarinet
even
the
new
reform
parti
a
breakoff
of
traditionalist
from
the
conserv
with
a
mildli
libertarian
faction
hold
our
public
health
insur
a
an
untouch
but
that
just
a
few
peopl
have
to
be
remind
that
it
not
free
the
averag
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscal
naiv
than
their
american
counterpart
on
issu
like
these
but
no
mention
of
copay
anywher
to
be
seen
but
cut
public
spend
all
over
the
place
and
bring
back
the
death
penalti
with
littl
hast
if
elect
i
know
that
for
pete
sake
i
live
right
on
the
border
i
know
the
canadian
system
isnt
social
medicin
unlik
britain
nh
sorri
it
just
that
i
even
run
into
peopl
from
buffalo
and
from
michigan
who
dont
know
the
point
is
that
mean
that
if
the
money
run
low
in
the
plan
your
out
of
luck
unless
you
can
afford
it
yourself
yeah
but
there
be
a
lot
of
leadtim
and
a
healthcar
crisi
that
would
preclud
it
if
provinci
govern
a
bad
a
some
of
them
are
heck
we
have
the
ndp
clean
up
a
spend
mess
made
by
the
conserv
in
saskatchewan
embarass
can
be
so
irrespons
there
is
still
realloc
health
insur
is
so
import
that
it
about
the
onli
thing
that
can
inspir
open
rebellion
and
violent
insurrect
outsid
of
the
hockey
rink
right
now
attempt
to
get
the
system
and
it
user
to
learn
good
habit
are
be
treat
like
codliv
oil
would
the
privat
insur
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
oblig
to
of
cours
they
could
eventu
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loath
to
do
so
and
out
of
practic
in
handl
such
basic
servic
too
some
of
the
compani
provid
extra
insur
are
subsidiari
of
american
compani
and
their
parent
provid
full
insur
down
here
regardless
all
firm
up
north
can
easili
turn
on
cabl
tv
to
see
how
well
the
american
firm
are
do
by
be
involv
in
basic
coverag
the
privat
firm
are
make
too
much
money
after
have
gotten
rid
of
basic
coverag
they
run
around
pat
them
self
on
the
back
for
their
own
cooper
in
provid
extra
for
those
peopl
who
deserv
it
yeah
but
eventu
it
go
to
creat
a
kind
of
twotier
effect
that
will
be
notic
after
a
while
like
in
britain
most
american
are
fear
of
a
singleti
system
serious
there
are
few
area
that
have
suffici
popul
for
a
twomoreti
system
like
what
the
french
have
a
health
polici
prof
dg
shea
ha
cite
studi
in
the
nejm
that
indic
have
a
popul
of
is
necessari
for
adequ
competit
and
in
canada
there
are
onli
four
citi
west
of
the
great
lake
with
that
popul
or
larger
anyway
the
number
show
that
cost
have
held
steadier
than
those
in
the
u
and
bar
ani
futur
chernobyllik
crisi
sudden
transient
in
spend
are
unlik
in
fact
the
health
alloc
is
one
of
the
most
wellbehav
sector
of
spend
up
north
so
ani
talk
of
bankruptci
is
talkradio
fodder
far
away
from
the
border
if
the
provinc
hit
fiscal
rough
spot
and
have
to
cut
back
the
thing
privat
insur
have
to
offer
will
seem
le
and
le
like
luxuri
and
the
gap
will
be
more
and
more
notic
thi
wont
be
overnight
and
someth
like
thi
would
forc
canada
to
have
a
system
more
like
the
french
one
but
that
not
a
bad
thing
and
the
chang
will
be
minim
ie
add
copay
and
frustrat
