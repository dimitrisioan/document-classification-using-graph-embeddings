is
an

which

not

but
i
think
that
american
take
their
religion
too
serious
to
the
point
of
tri
to
convert
anyon
or
anyth
to
their
particular
sect
it
a
question
of

not

all
monotheist

breed

into

islam
judaism
and
christian
religion
is
not
the
opiat

and
brother
it
look
like
your
pretti
hop
up
on
your
own
selfright
never
heard
of
arguement
by
absurd
eh
no
also
call
sarcasm
the
usual
procedur
is
to
accept
some
part
of
the
opposit
arguement
and
run
with
it
until
one
go
beyond
ration
thought
and
then
ring
the
chang
zb
the
idea
of
a
minimum
wage
is
consid
a
good
one
and
in
these
time
of
econom
difficulti
the
washington
legislatur
is
proposs
to
rais
the
state
minwag
from
the
feder
level
to
fifteen
cent
over
oregon
it
would
seem
to
me
that
thi
increas
doe
not
keep
pace
with
inflat
that
the
minimum
wage
should
be
to
by
my
figur
so
it
is
propos
that
we
rais
the
minimum
wage
to
per
hour
by
juli
and
then
give
a
cost
of
live
increas
everi
juli
and
anyon
who
doesnt
like
it
is
