it
look
like
there
will
no
wit
to
disput
that
claim
there
were
adult
an
child
in
the
compound
funni
how
the
fire
seem
to
start
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
build
just
next
to
where
a
tank
wa
back
away
though
probabl
just

report
a
third
i
wa
not
abl
to
verifi
it
from
the
videotap
howev
someon
el
identifi
a
fire
shown
to
be
start
behind
the
small
tower
in
the
second
flag
on
left
camera
angl
the
flame
come
out
of
the
build
are
yelloworang
thi
is
the
normal
colour
for
carbon
compound
burn
the
flame
were
those
of
a
solid
or
confin
liquid
burn
not
of
a
ga
explod
the
explos
that
occur
mid
way
along
the
build
is
certainli
not
an
explos
though
the
cloud
itself
is
on
fire
thi
would
seem
to
be
most
like
to
be
some
sort
of
fuel
oil
store
explod
rather
than
the
explos
of
a
magazin
funni
how
consid
there
wa
to
be
a
great
cach
of
explos
ammunit
etc
in
the
compound
i
did
not
see
ani
seri
of
explos
depend
entir
on
how
they
were
distribut
you
would
not
be
abl
to
identifi
ammunit
round
go
off
from
video
camera
coverag
from
a
mile
away
if
and
when
the
fbi
releas
pictur
from
cmera
on
the
armour
vehicl
which
presum
exist
it
might
be
possibl
to
get
a
clearer
pictur
if
anyon
expect
to
see
explos
hollywood
style
aka
rambo
movi
then
rememb
that
in
real
life
car
do
not
burst
into
flame
when
go
over
cliff
just
about
the
most
you
could
expect
would
be
to
see
the
grenad
go
off
sinc
the
build
wa
design
to
be
blast
proof
to
some
extent
it
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
the
grenad
go
off
from
the
collaps
of
the
build
due
to
the
fire
and
oop
the
automat
weapon
were
probabl
burnt
up
in
the
fire
with
the
other
wit
paranoia
unless
i
see
videotap
show
the
davidian
start
the
fire
i
guess
i
may
have
a
problem
believ
the
fed
say
they
saw
them
do
it
but
couldnt
or
didnt
manag
to
tape
it
they
have
been
tape
everyth
el
you
wouldnt
beleiv
the
fbi
if
they
show
you
a
pictur
of
koresh
himself
set
light
to
the
place
your
mindset
is
such
that
you
are
simpli
unabl
to
accept
a
true
anyth
that
might
suggest
that
a
group
of
heavili
arm
weapon
fanat
might
inde
be
in
the
wrong
the
gun
lobbi
cant
accept
that
the
bd
set
light
to
the
place
becaus
that
would
mean
that
koreh
had
murder
child
that
would
mean
that
their
take
hi
account
of
the
murder
of
batf
agent
would
be
even
le
credibl
than
it
wa
to
start
with
koresh
had
day
to
come
out
with
hi
hand
up
and
face
a
fair
trial
instead
he
order
the
murder
of
everyon
