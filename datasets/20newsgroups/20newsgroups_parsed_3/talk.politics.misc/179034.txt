a
you

he
wa

he
take
full
respons
for

and
stand
percent
behind
attorney
gener
reno
q
the
question
now
aris
yesterday
we
were
told
that
he
wa
brief
on
thi
but
we
never
got
a
firm
idea
of
how
much
he
knew
of
what
the
plan
wa
and
the
justif
for
the
plan
and
the
justif
of
the
time
wa
he
fulli
inform
on
all
of
that
all
of
thi
about
the
increas
level
of
violenc
insid
the
compound
that
made
them
want
to
go
now
the
feel
that
noth
el
wa
go
to
succeed
et
cetera
m
myer
he
talk
with
the
attorney
gener
about
the
decis
about
she
talk
to
him
about
the
factor
that
led
to
her
decis
he
rais
no
object
he
support
her
decis
to
go
forward
with
it
he
wa
fulli
brief
q
of
cours
hindsight
is
but
look
back
now
doe
the
presid
doe
the
white
hous
feel
that
the
decis
he
sign
off
on
prove
to
be
the
right
way
to
go
when
you
look
at
what
actual
happen
m
myer
i
think
everybodi
feel
bad
when
life
is
lost
but
i
dont
think
that
that
is
reason
to
secondguess
the
decis
he
stand
behind
the
decis
that
wa
made
he
wa
inform
about
it
he
wa
fulli
brief
about
it
and
he
stand
percent
behind
the
attorney
gener
the
justic
depart
and
the
fbi
it
a
difficult
oper
and
there
it
had
alreadi
gone
on
for
more
than
seven
week
four
feder
agent
had
lost
their
live
in
the
line
of
duti
let
not
forget
that
thi
wa
a
veri
difficult
situat
and
all
the
decis
involv
were
veri
difficult
but
all
the
agent
on
the
ground
the
fbi
the
justic
depart
all
recommend
move
forward
with
thi
they
thought
given
the
circumst
it
wa
the
best
possibl
cours
of
action
there
just
no
point
in
second
guess
those
decis
now
i
think
that
there
a
reason
q
whi
not
they
have
to
m
myer
no
not
to
secondguess
the
decis
i
think
it
import
to
take
a
look
at
it
to
have
an
investig
i
think
the
presid
will
talk
some
about
that
later
today
but
at
thi
from
thi
vantag
point
to
secondguess
those
decis
it
not
use
q
you
sound
like
he
go
to
order
an
investig
of
what
happen
and
whether
m
myer
i
think
hell
have
more
to
say
about
that
later
ye
q
he
will
order
an
investig
m
myer
hell
have
more
ye
hell
have
more
to
say
about
an
investig
q
what
kind
of
investig
m
myer
hell
have
more
to
say
about
it
later
q
but
in
the
monday
morn
quarterback
sure
there
is
some
soulsearch
now
a
to
whether
it
wa
the
right
decis
you
cant
say
that
we
did
the
best
we
could
when
it
turn
out
to
be
a
rather
a
debacl
m
myer
i
think
well
obvious
well
review
the
situat
and
all
the
factor
that
lead
to
a
veri
tragic
outcom
i
dont
think
anybodi
disput
that
the
outcom
wa
tragic
but
again
the
presid
stand
behind
the
decis
that
were
made
and
well
take
a
look
at
the
factor
that
contribut
to
that
q
what
wa
the
fbi
director
role
in
thi
m
myer
well
he
wa
obvious
involv
in
set
up
the
oper
he
sign
off
on
it
a
did
the
agent
that
were
on
the
ground
that
were
work
with
him
i
dont
believ
he
spoke
to
the
presid
but
ill
doublecheck
that
q
but
he
wa
veri
close
involv
in
everi
aspect
of
plan
and
so
forth
m
myer
i
would
refer
you
to
the
fbi
on
exactli
what
aspect
he
wa
involv
with
q
will
janet
reno
be
come
over
to
the
white
hous
today
m
myer
there
no
plan
meet
i
dont
believ
that
shell
be
here
q
she
wont
be
at
thi
event
at
pm
m
myer
no
no
plan
to
be
q
do
you
think
that
there
go
to
be
a
jump
on
on
the
part
of
polit
opposit
to
make
someth
out
of
thi
in
term
of
to
the
presid
detriment
polit
m
myer
well
i
would
certainli
hope
that
peopl
wouldnt
tri
to
use
thi
tragedi
for
polit
reason
obvious
i
think
again
that
it
use
to
look
at
the
fact
to
reevalu
the
fact
and
i
think
the
presid
will
move
forward
with
that
but
i
think
peopl
understand
that
thi
wa
a
difficult
seri
of
decis
that
it
wa
a
veri
difficult
situat
that
it
wa
caus
by
a
man
who
wa
a
cult
leader
who
wa
involv
in
the
death
of
four
feder
agent
and
i
think
it
most
tragic
that
a
lot
of
innoc
child
lost
their
live
in
thi
i
dont
think
anybodi
disput
the
tragedi
of
the
outcom
q
dee
dee
what
wa
the
white
hous
role
in
handl
the
i
guess
public
relat
aspect
in
the
aftermath
who
wa
talk
who
here
at
the
white
hous
wa
talk
with
peopl
at
justic
to
set
up
reno
news
confer
to
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
m
myer
i
think
the
attorney
gener
handl
her
end
of
the
situat
herself
and
made
the
decis
to
go
ahead
with
the
news
confer
onc
there
wa
a
point
at
which
there
wa
enough
inform
i
think
to
talk
with
some
accuraci
about
what
had
transpir
dure
the
day
obvious
peopl
here
at
a
number
of
level
were
keep
in
touch
with
peopl
at
the
justic
depart
and
at
the
fbi
to
tri
to
keep
inform
about
what
wa
happen
there
q
but
reno
said
that
she
didnt
talk
to
the
presid
and
there
seem
to
be
an
indic
she
hadnt
talk
to
anybodi
at
the
white
hous
so
who
m
myer
there
were
peopl
talk
on
a
staffto
staff
level
q
i
understand
but
who
at
the
justic
depart
wa
handl
that
for
reno
who
wa
talk
to
the
white
hous
m
myer
there
were
a
number
of
peopl
a
you
know
webb
hubbel
is
the
liaison
to
the
white
hous
and
i
know
he
talk
to
a
number
of
peopl
here
there
were
a
number
of
peopl
at
a
number
of
differ
level
involv
i
dont
want
to
get
into
exactli
who
had
what
convers
with
whom
but
there
were
a
number
of
convers
obvious
the
justic
depart
wa
work
to
keep
the
white
hous
inform
the
press
inform
to
the
best
of
it
abil
a
event
unfold
throughout
the
day
q
did
webb
hubbel
talk
to
the
presid
m
myer
i
dont
believ
so
i
dont
know
if
he
talk
he
may
have
at
one
point
q
and
wa
the
white
hous
role
just
to
seek
inform
about
what
happen
or
wa
it
to
direct
the
public
inform
campaign
that
follow
m
myer
it
wa
both
to
keep
abreast
of
the
situat
so
the
presid
could
be
on
top
of
it
but
i
think
the
justic
depart
manag
it
press
relat
on
it
we
were
obvious
veri
interest
in
what
wa
happen
there
throughout
the
day
and
the
presid
wa
follow
it
veri
close
throughout
the
day
q
dee
dee
on
that
though
if
the
presid
wa
follow
it
so
close
and
he
had
talk
the
night
befor
with
janet
reno
whi
wouldnt
he
talk
to
her
at
all
sinc
then
m
myer
again
i
dont
know
if
he
talk
to
her
thi
morn
again
he
kept
fulli
awar
of
what
ha
been
go
on
throughout
the
day
he
stand
percent
behind
her
decis
he
been
fulli
support
of
her
a
he
said
yesterday
morn
befor
event
transpir
and
yesterday
afternoon
in
a
written
statement
q
but
wouldnt
he
want
to
convey
those
thought
to
her
person
yesterday
m
myer
one
more
time
i
dont
know
if
theyv
spoken
thi
morn
q
no
yesterday
q
clearli
there
a
percept
that
she
wa
left
hung
out
to
dri
all
day
yesterday
m
myer
that
just
not
true
i
think
we
said
throughout
the
day
that
the
presid
take
full
respons
that
he
stand
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
the
presid
stand
foursquar
behind
the
attorney
gener
on
thi
he
accept
full
respons
for
the
event
that
transpir
he
believ
that
janet
reno
the
justic
depart
and
the
fbi
act
a
best
they
could
given
the
circumst
and
the
fact
that
were
evid
at
the
time
i
dont
know
what
el
he
can
say
to
show
that
he
support
her
percent
q
one
of
the
best
indic
of
that
is
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
tell
her
m
myer
again
i
dont
know
whether
theyv
spoken
thi
morn
q
whi
cant
we
find
out
m
myer
well
we
can
i
cant
do
it
stand
here
right
now
q
youv
got
six
peopl
here
all
theyv
got
to
do
is
pick
up
the
phone
m
myer
helen
well
get
back
to
you
q
dee
dee
when
the
presid
spoke
with
the
attorney
gener
on
sunday
is
it
safe
to
assum
that
either
she
volunt
or
he
inquir
about
whether
there
wa
a
possibl
downsid
to
increas
pressur
on
the
davidian
m
myer
i
think
that
they
discus
the
situat
again
im
not
go
to
get
into
the
specif
detail
of
what
exactli
she
told
him
but
i
think
that
he
wa
awar
of
the
risk
involv
q
dee
dee
the
presid
yesterday
morn
said
it
wa
entir
her
decis
she
then
said
that
she
told
him
what
wa
happen
and
he
said
okay
doe
the
presid
regard
it
that
he
gave
the
goahead
or
that
she
gave
the
goahead
m
myer
i
think
what
they
both
said
yesterday
wa
that
she
made
a
decis
base
on
all
the
avail
fact
she
inform
him
about
that
and
he
rais
no
object
again
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
about
that
q
and
he
said
okay
the
issu
is
over
the
respons
m
myer
he
said
okay
q
doe
okay
mean
m
myer
the
presid
accept
ultim
respons
q
dee
dee
the
presid
investig
that
he
go
to
announc
would
that
be
conduct
by
someon
outsid
the
administr
m
myer
no
q
it
would
be
intern
is
it
meant
to
preclud
ani
congression
investig
m
myer
no
it
meant
simpli
to
follow
up
on
the
incid
that
occur
yesterday
q
and
you
would
i
assum
therefor
cooper
fulli
with
ani
congression
hear
that
would
be
held
m
myer
to
the
best
of
our
abil
q
dee
dee
there
are
two
report
out
thi
morn
one
that
the
justic
depart
or
fbi
or
whomev
appar
had
a
bug
plant
insid
the
complex
and
the
other
is
that
the
child
may
have
been
inject
with
some
kind
of
poison
that
may
have
either
left
them
unconsci
or
mayb
even
kill
them
befor
the
fire
what
do
you
know
about
those
two
m
myer
noth
more
than
ive
seen
in
news
account
thi
morn
we
may
get
more
on
it
later
but
at
thi
point
i
know
im
not
sure
anybodi
know
ani
more
than
what
wa
report
by
peopl
who
came
out
of
the
compound
q
ha
the
presid
receiv
ani
report
today
in
term
of
fatal
and
actual
what
wa
go
on
what
theyv
been
abl
to
find
out
on
in
the
compound
now
m
myer
he

brief
i
dont
think
that
theyv
gotten
into
the
compound
yet
they
were
still
wait
for
it
to
cool
off
i
dont
think
there
much
beyond
what
been
report
in
the
news
account
but
he
ha
been
kept
uptod
on
it
q
dee
dee
the
presid
stand
behind
attorney
gener
reno
but
doe
he
feel
that
she
perhap
got
bad
advic
from
the
socal
expert
m
myer
he
believ
that
she
made
he
stand
behind
the
decis
that
she
made
it
wa
the
unanim
decis
of
her
advisor
of
the
fbi
of
the
agent
on
the
ground
and
he
support
that
q
what
about
the
valid
of
the
decis
made
on
the
ground
doe
he
back
those
m
myer
he

q
dee
dee

he
stand
behind
the
decis
which
she
made
normal
in

situat
like
thi
the

im
say
that
the
presid
wa
brief
about
the
decis
he
okay
it
and
he
accept
full
respons
for
it
q
but
then
whi
do
you
keep
use
the
terminolog
the
decis
that
she
made
rather
than
the
decis
that
he
made
m
myer
becaus
a
he
said
yesterday

the
fact
base
on
evid
present
