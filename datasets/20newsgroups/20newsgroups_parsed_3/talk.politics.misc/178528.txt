come
to
that
under
the
origin
plan
there
wasnt
meant
to
be
anyth
much
for
the
feder
govern
to
do
except
keep
the
british
out
that
also
untru
but
at
least
were
wander
a
littl
closer
toward
realiti
that
the
articl
of
confeder
fell
apart
is
enough
proof
it
wa
there
for
just
a
tad
bit
more
well
ye
and
no
the
federalist
paper
are
propaganda
and
it
is
therefor
difficult
to
determin
precis
what
maddison
etc
were
up
to
from
them
there
are
a
coupl
of
way
to
look
at
them
one
is
we
want
you
to
support
thi
constitut
so
well
say
anyth
that
we
think
will
appeal
to
you
or
the
more
straightforward
thi
is
whi
we
think
what
weve
suggest
in
thi
constitut
is
a
good
idea
you
clearli
consid
the
former
to
be
the
primari
situat
they
certainli
emphasis
a
limit
role
for
the
feder
govern
but
thi
wa
not
necessarili
their
true
posit
well
i
know
hamilton
wa
a
dy
in
the
wool
monarchist
and
probabl
the
authoritarian
extrem
to
jefferson
democrat
impul
but
what
would
you
suggest
a
a
mean
of
determin
their
opinion
on
the
govern
if
we
dont
consid
what
they
wrote
about
the
govern
and
is
write
in
support
of
someth
automat
propoganda
to
the
point
we
must
assum
it
is
untru
or
that
they
are
say
what
they
dont
believ
and
like
the
hous
of
lord
which
it
is
copi
from
it
wa
given
pretti
wide
power
unfortun
they
start
to
use
them
and
thu
the
gridlock
set
in
i
wasnt
awar
the
hous
of
lord
had
wide
power
i
wa
under
the
impress
is
wa
pretti
powerless
compar
to
the
hous
of
common
and
certainli
didnt
have
almost
equal
their
power
the
senat
is
restrict
onli
that
it
may
not
introduc
bill
relat
to
rais
revenu
the
senat
wa
le
power
than
the
hous
of
lord
in
the
period
in
question
if
the
senat
wa
le
power
than
the
hous
of
lord
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
hous
of
repres
wa
also
in
fact
they
both
were
becaus
the
british
govern
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
my
read
of
the
constitut
and
other
write
give
me
absolut
no
reason
to
believ
the
senat
wasnt
intend
to
make
use
of
their
lawmak
power
in
fact
gridlock
appear
to
have
been
design
into
the
system
with
the
senat
be
a
more
delib
bodi
to
act
a
a
check
on
the
moreoften
elect
hous
the
system
is
meant
to
be
slow
to
react
the
problem
is
that
it
end
up
a
bit
too
slow
i
disagre
the
system
is
not
too
slow
it
wa
simpli
design
to
handl
le
than
it
ha
demand
that
it
handl
a
somebodi
in
washington
put
it
whose
name
i
forget
congress
ha
becom
everybodi
citi
council
congress
is
more
than
capabl
of
quick
action
and
ha
more
than
enough
power
and
time
on
it
hand
if
it
confin
itself
to
what
it
origin
jurisidict
wa
and
allow
more
local
autonomi
it
is
not
a
case
of
the
system
of
govern
they
creat
fail
but
that
it
is
oper
under
a
set
of
condit
they
specif
want
to
avoid
name
a
concentr
of
power
it
would
seem
then
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
not
to
reduc
the
power
of
either
hous
in
some
attempt
to
greas
the
wheel
all
youll
get
then
is
a
system
which
move
quicker
to
do
stupid
thing
it
would
make
more
sens
to
make
more
decis
at
a
local
level
on
what
basi
do
you
suggest
that
the
senat
wa
suppos
to
be
some
sort
of
rubberstamp
for
the
hous
youll
note
that
while
the
presid
veto
may
be
overridden
the
hous
cant
do
anyth
about
a
veto
by
the
senat
the
presid
veto
wa
meant
to
be
entir
separ
until
bush
abus
it
in
a
quit
extraordinari
manner
it
wa
use
more
in
accord
with
the
intent
of
be
a
check

legisl
pleas
explain
to
me
how
bush
abus
the

in
an
extraordinari

the

wa
clearli

a
a
complet
last

measur
it
use
wa
meant
to
be
restrict
to
prevent
the
legislatur
interf
with
the
action
of
the
execut
i
fail
to
see
where
ani
restrict
impli
or
otherwis
were
place
on
the

it
could
just
a
easili
have
been
read
a
a
mean
to
put
a
check
on
democrat
popular
but
unwis
in
the
execut
opinion
polici
there
is
no
limit
in
the
constitut
to
the
presid

power
regard
what
a
bill
is
for
previou
presid
have
use
the

for
ani
number
of
reason
most
usual
have
someth
to
do
with
their

i
am
realli
curiou
how
you
singl
bush
out
a
the
presid
who
abus
veto
the
senat
is
not
meant
to
be
exactli
a
rubber
stamp
bodi
it
is
meant
a
a
check
on
unrestrain
legisl
that
is
the
extra
measur
built
into
the
constitut
in
favour
of
the
statu
quo
of
the
repres
of
the
state
is
not
a
reason
restrict
whi
is
it
not
a
reason
restrict
becaus
senat
is
the
magic
holi
number
upon
which
law
must
be
base
if
senat
feel
safe
enough
with
their
state
constitu
to
stand
up
and
fillibust
isnt
that
enough
to
indic
there
a
suffici
question
a
to
whether
a
law
is
a
good
idea
or
not
to
reevalu
it
whi
one
earth
should
be
suffici
to
enact
a
law
which
cover
million
peopl
in
veri
veri
divers
place
and
live
in
radic
differ
condit
whi
shouldnt
a
supermajor
be
requir
ani
system
in
which
the
simpl
major
is
given
absolut
power
to
ignor
the
minor
then
the

will
be

i
do
not
see
thi
a

for
all
that
im

the
