the
onli
studi
ive
seen
indic
a
higher
proport
of
homosexu
in
prison
than
in
the
gener
popul
but
i
dont
think
that
allow
for
the
default
you

to
prison
is
not
a
normal
situat
but
i
havent
seen
anyth
that
suggest
that

proport
is
lower
than
in
the
gener
popul
although
it
seem
plausibl
anyway

the
fact
that
there
are
more
homosexu
in
prison
doe
not
mean
that
homosexu
are
immor
and
more
liabl
to
commit

must
rememb
that

is
not
necessarili
