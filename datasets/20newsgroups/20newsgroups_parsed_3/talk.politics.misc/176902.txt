labor
is
a
tough
one
labor
is
defin

a
the
effort
both
mental
and
physic
of
human
capit
is
defin
a
intermedi
good
use
to
creat
other
good
and
servic
now
if
a
slave
is
consid
an
intermedi
good
then
the
slave
ha
now
been
dehuman
and
is
simpli
a
machin
not
good
for
the

prohuman
right
argument
so

sorri
the
question
of
defin
slave
labor
is
no
tougher
than
defin
the
labor
of
a

slave

can
you
provid
some
evid
that
the
slave
state
regard
slave
a
not
human
they
were
outsid
our
societi
and
similar
phrase
that
basic
meant
that
they
didnt
have
to
recogn
a
have
the
same
right
a
a
free
person
but
they
were
never
consid
not
human
to
my
knowledg
like
a
hors
that
pull
a
plow
a
slave
labor
is
the
return
on
the
capit
requir
to
purchas
and
feed
him
the

so
obviou
im
not

if
that
