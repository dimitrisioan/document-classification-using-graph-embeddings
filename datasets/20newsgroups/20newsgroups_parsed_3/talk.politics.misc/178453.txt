okay
let
me
tri
to
explain
thi
when
one
vote
for
such
a
creatur
a
a
senat
or
wors
yet
a
presid
one
vote
not
for
specif
polici
but
for
a
gener
packag
which
must
cover
all
issu
for
or
year
a
such
one
influenc
is
highli
dilut
i
might
add
that
even
if
one
were
free
to
vote
on
individu
regul
the
vast
amount
of
time
requir
for
consid
a
particular
regul
combin
with
the
veri
small
chanc
of
one
vote
make
a
differ
would
make
it
unreason
to
expect
the
voter
to
make
an
intellig
decis
with
respect
to
specif
regul
im
afraid
that
ive
lost
the
thread
here
i
didnt
suggest
that
all
govern
regul
be
subject
to
referendum
so
i
dont
follow
the
comment
abov
sorri
but
it
strike
me
that
it
is
the
onli
feasibl
approach
what
is
not
feasibl
is
a
wholesal
attack
on
all
govern
regul
and
licens
that
treat
cut
hair
and
practic
medicin
a
equival
task
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
feasibl
in
thi
case
do
you
mean
that
are
imposs
in
pricipl
or
mere
that
it
would
be
undesir
in
fact
i
mean
that
an
ideolog
that
treat
all
govern
regul
a
equal
undesir
and
seek
to
abolish
all
regul
is
unlik
to
draw
support
among
more
than
a
miniscul
portion
of
the
elector
furthermor
i
am
suggest
that
such
a
plan
is
not
feasibl
in
an
industri
societi
becaus
the
weight
of
litig
andor
miseri
it
would
produc
would
effect
crush
product
effort
actual
the
onli
area
of
public
spend
abov
that
strike
me
a
gener
substanti
support
among
libertarian
are
polic
and
defens
it
is
an
interest
asid
that
a
commit
a
libertarian
claim
to
be
to
a
principl
of
noncoercion
the
onli
area
of
public
spend
that
they
frequent
support
involv
hire
peopl
with
gunshmmm
you
say
thi
a
if
it
were
surpris
yet
in
fact
a
necessari
consequ
of
libertarian
philosophi
all
noncoers
function
should
be
dealt
with
privat
therefor
it
follow
that
the
onli
function
remain
to
the
state
are
the
coersiv
one
no
im
not
surpris
i
just
think
it
interest
that
on
one
hand
libertarian
assum
a
limit
govern
can
be
decre
yet
on
the
other
posit
an
entir
govern
made
up
of
peopl
who
carri
gun
i
realiz
that
mani
libertarian
assum
that
such
a
govern
will
be
counterbalanc
by
a
fulli
arm
citizenri
but
it
is
worth
note
that
widespread
civilian
ownership
of
gun
doe
not
necessarili
prevent
the
establish
of
totalitarian
govern
eg
iraq
perhap
you
have
may
i
suggest
that
you
consid
that
revolutionari
frequent
gener
support
by
act
a
protector
of
geezer
mother
and
child
govern
that
ignor
such
peopl
on
the
ground
that
we
dont
have
much
to
fear
from
them
do
so
at
their
own
peril
much
more
like
it
drunken
teenag
the
group
in
questionar
more
like
to
be
wors
off
dure
and
after
a
revolut
than
befor
in
the
unlik
event
that
you
miss
my
earlier
sarcasm
let
me
say
thi
directli
the
idea
that
such
program
a
social
secur
or
afdc
should
be
consid
defens
an
idea
which
ha
been
advanc
in
th
and
other
newsgroup
is
so
absurd
a
lie
a
to
be
unworthi
of
consider
do
you
serious
disput
thi
yup
sure
do
but
sinc
i
also
support
the
constitut
requir
that
the
govern
provid
for
the
gener
welfar
articl
i
section
im
will
to
justifi
such
program
on
that
basi
i
dont
want
to
seem
patron
but
you
still
seem
to
be
labor
under
the
delus
that
under
a
social
econom
system
it
is
reason
intellig

honest
person
like
yourself
who
make
the
decis
i
feel

is
everi
bit
a
like
to
be
ignor

corrupt
a
the
buyer
or

i
dont
expect
you
to
agre
with
me
but
you
explain
whi
you
feel
im
wrong
well
in
the
first
place
i
dont
support
a
social
econom

i
think
within
limit
that
capit
is
a
fine
idea
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
ani

like

there
