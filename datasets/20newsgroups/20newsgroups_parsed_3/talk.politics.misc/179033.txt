a
system
of
check
what
other
nation
are
in
to
a
criterion
for
what
our

should
tri
i
counter
that
the

jim
if
youll
check
the
constitut
youll
find
in
order
to
promot
the

welfaredo
ordain

im
surpris
you
miss
it
it
right
there
in
the
first
paragraph
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made
it
at
least
through
the
preambl
you
almost
got
it
right
and
it
wa
a
good
tri
but
you
should
follow
your
own
advic
the
preambl
to
the
constitut
doe
read
a
you
have
quot
but
let
u
not
forget
that
after
all
it
is
onli
the
preambl
it
is
not
a
bind
part
of
the
constitut
and
carri
no
weight
in
the
law
that
poor
tortur
paragraph
ha
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfortun
passag
in
the
english
languag
wit
the
legion
of
blowhard
like
yourself
who
think
those
vagu
floweri
phrase
are
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
do
you
realli
believ
that
a
politician
onli
ha
to
give
lip
servic
to
promot
the
gener
welfar
to
be
within
the
limit
of
the

sorri
buddi
but
some
other
blowhard
manag
to
includ
the

welfar
in
anoth

articl
i

i
guess
they
want
to
make
sure
everyon
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preambl
just
to
make
sure
youv
got
the
point
let
do
a
littl
experi
what
if
the

a
follow
preambl
we
the

to
promot

welfar
do
ordain

constitut
the
feder
govern

have
one
function
and
one
function
onli
to
provid
for
the
defens
of
