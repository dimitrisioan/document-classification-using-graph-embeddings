a
signal
a

by
the
american

by

the

the
problem
is
that
after
the

of

the

ha
an

the
usa
could
go
quit
far
to
mend
the
bridg
with

the
peopl
there
are
rather
piss
off
becaus
the
usa
first
support
the

who
they
loath
and
then
support
saddam
when
he
mount
an

iran
is
meant
to
be

bigot
not
the

so
if
there
is
to

movement
it
would
be
easier
for
the

to
move
first
off
they
could
recognis

the
iraniraq
war
provid
technic
assist
to
iran
to
get
it
oil
product
back
up
to

would
also
be
a
smart
move
at
the

iran
is

if
they
had

they
would
use
