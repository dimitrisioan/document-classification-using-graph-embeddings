it
consist
in
a
way
that

is
not
thi

is
also
say
that
they
were
trap
insid
by
the
damag
done
by
the
tank
whi
is
an
accident
fire
more
plausibl
than
a
mass
suicid
consid
that
the
davidian
were
an
apocalypt
cult
with
a
histori
of
arm
violenc
if
the
fbi
ha
reason
to
lie
about
the
caus
of
the
fire
if
it
result
from
their
own
neglig
then
the
bd
survivor
also
have
reason
to
lie
if
they
start
the
blaze
the
fbi
claim
the

wa
set
simultan
in
three
place
they
claim
the

were
roll
all
around
how
did
the

coordin
the
set
of
the
fire
it
fairli
simpl
it
wa
decid
to
burn
the
place
down
and
more
than
one
agent
wa
dispatch
to
set
the
fire
in
separ
part
of
the
compound
i
doubt
that
simultan
mean
at
the
exact
same
time
in
thi
case
it
like
mean
close
enough
togeth
to
preclud
them
from
be
part
of
the
same
fire
the
fbi
claim
that
men
with
torch
set
the
fire
but
havent
releas
ani
evid
of
thi
though
it
seem
inconciev
that
they
dont
have
ani
if
it
wa
true
they
might
be
wait
until
the
evid
come
in
from
the
site
and
the
investig
is
at
least
well
underway
all
of
the
bd
previou
action
were
aim
toward
their
surviv
not
their
death
the
same
could
be
said
of
jonestown
the
idea
that
kerosen
lamp
would
be
all
over
the
place
with
electr
cut
off
make
sen
the
idea
that
ram
tank
into
the
build
would
spill
them
and
caus
a
fire
make
sen
the
possibl
that
the

wouldnt
know
thi
is
nil
it
wasnt

again
ive
been
