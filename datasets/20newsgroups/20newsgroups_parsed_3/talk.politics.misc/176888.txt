a
real
world
data
point
a
person
ha
a
much
stronger
legal
claim
for
harrass
sexual
or
otherwis
if
they
make
it
clear
to
the
offend
that
their
behaviour
is
unwant
if
the
behaviour
persist
harrass
is
much
easier
to
demonstr
due
to
the
fact
that
the
offend
knew
that
the
behaviour
wa
unwant
no
argument
here
my
origin
queri
regard
the
question
of
whi
the
first
sexual
proposit
made
by
person
a
to
person
b
would
be
consid
to
be
sexual
harass
by
somemani
peopl
assum
of
cours
that
there
doe
not
exist
a
power
relationship
between
a
and
b
such
that
the
proposit
carri
strong
implic
of
extort
right
from
word
one
i
can
onli
say
that
those
peopl
are
wrong
the
word
harass
mean
to
irrit
or
torment
persist
id
hardli
consid
one
time
to
fall
under
the
definit
of
persist
addit
there
is
no
basi
to
assum
the
behaviour
is
unwant
unlik
an
illeg
proposit
of
cours
i
think
the
origin
question
of
offer
money
for
sex
is
inargu
harrass
becaus
the
activ
is
illeg
and
could
be
presum
to
be
unwant
by
the
averag
citizen
i
have
to
take
issu
with
thi
viewpoint
given
that
a
prostitut
is
a
victimless
crime
and
b
there
are
liter
million
of
american
who
particip
in
some
sort
of
victimless
activ
which
the
state
ha
defin
to
be
crimin
eg
prostitut
obscen
gambl
use
certain
recreat
drug
have
nonmercenari
sex
with
person
not
one
spous
in
certain
state
have
unnatur
sex
with
peopl
regardless
of
marit
statu
or
exchang
of
money
in
certain
state
etc
id
have
to
say
that
the
idea
that
an
activ
may
be
presum
to
be
unwant
by
the
averag
citizen
mere
becaus
it
is
illeg
is
the
sort
of
sophistri
that
onli
a
judg
could
indulg
in
with

straight

the

to

assum
that
an

i

i
would
need

of
the

becaus
a
