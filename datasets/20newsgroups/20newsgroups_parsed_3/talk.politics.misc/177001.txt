becaus
peopl
vote
for
him
im
not
sure
if
you

to
impli
that
or
not
but
i
just
thought
id
bring
that
up
hitler
becam
chancellor
becaus
peopl
vote
for
hi
polit
parti
that
not
a
huge
differ
in
a
parliamentari
system
your
statement
is
a
common
misconcept
but
it
just
isnt
true
in
the
german
weimar
system
the
chancellor
wa
not
necessarili
the
leader
of
the
largest
reichstag
parti
the
chancellor
wa
appoint
by
the
presid
and
gener
wa
the
leader
of
a
coalit
of
parti
who
could
form
an
effect
major
in
the
reichstag
beyond
that
the
implic
that
hitler
rose
to
the
chancellorship
becaus
a
major
of
german
want
nazi
rule
is
fals
a
well
befor
presid
hindenburg
appoint
hitler
chancellor
in
januari
the
german
peopl
did
not
show
a
particular
desir
to
be
led
either
by
hitler
or
by
the
nazi
parti
these
are
the
result
of
the
march
elect
for
presid
the
closest
hitler
ever
came
to
direct
elect
hindenburg
hitler
thaelmann
duesterberg
in
the
runoff
elect
in
april
the
result
were
hindenburg
hitler
thaelmann
so
we
can
see
that
hitler
person
wa
support
by
onli
about
a
third
of
german
voter
similarli
the
nazi
parti
never
receiv
more
than
of
the
vote
in
reichstag
elect
that
occur
in
juli
in
the
novemb
elect
the
nazi
lost
two
million
vote
and
seat
down
from
to
out
of
the
in
the
reichstag
comparit
the
socialist
had
and
the
communist
the
communist
had
gain
seat
and
the
german
nation
parti
which
had
support
the
previou
govern
had
pick
up
a
million
of
the
nazi
lost
vote
to
gain
seat
up
to
i
think
the
other
larg
parti
wa
the
cathol
center
parti
i
dont
know
how
mani
seat
they
had
but
i
think
they
were
declin
and
there
were
numer
other
small
parti
thu
the
nazi
vote
wa
on
the
declin
at
the
time
hitler
wa
appoint
chancellor
what
brought
hitler
to
power
wa
not
the
demand
of
the
german
peopl
for
hitler
or
the
nazi
to
run
thing
but
the
inabl
of
the
other
parti
to
put
their
differ
behind
them
in
favor
of
form
an
effect
govern
for
the
countri
germani
did
not
have
an
endur
democrat
tradit
and
their
parliamentari
system
lack
effect
center
parti
that
favor
the
interest
of
the
major
of
the
popul
instead
what
they
had
wa
a
number
of
small
parti
who
were
unabl
to
put
asid
their
own
specif
object
in
order
to
combin
against
the
nazi
who
were
out
to
end
the
democrat
process
in
fact
part
of
the
problem
wa
that
some
of
the
other
parti
with
substanti
represent
like
the
communist
were
also
out
to
end
the
democrat
process
but
with
differ
result
in
mind
and
gener
didnt
mind
see
parliamentari
democraci
go
under
germani
had
alreadi
had
a
nonnazi
chancellor
with
a
major
coalit
for
five
month
while
the
nazi
had
been
the
largest
reichstag
parti
and
there
certainli
wa
no
danger
of
a
revolut
in
favor
of
the
nazi
if
anyth
the
nazi
were
start
to
get
desper
becaus
they
had
fail
to
get
enough
support
to
make
hitler
presid
and
their
popular
vote
had
begun
to
declin
hitler
wa
not
hindenburg
first
choic
to
be
chancellor
not
even
hi
second
choic
first
von
papen
had
been
chancellor
sinc
june
after
the
novemb
elect
when
the
nazi
lost
seat
hindenburg
first
prevail
on
von
papen
to
remain
a
chancellor
but
there
were
intrigu
behind
hi
back
and
support
for
him
wa
lack
so
then
hindenburg
turn
to
von
schleicher
who
becam
chancellor
for
two
month
eventu
he
too
wa
unabl
to
hold
togeth
a
work
coalit
of

to
oppos
the
nazi
who
refus
to
particip
in
ani
govern
that
wa
not
led
by
a
nazi
chancellor
some
of
the
nazi
leadership
particularli
gregor
strasser
who
wa
the
man
in
the
parti
at
the
time
want
to
particip
in
a

govern
but
other
know
the

support
wa
wane
figur
that
their
best
hope
to
gain
power
lay
in
undermin
the
democrat
process
nevertheless
the
countri
wa
govern
for
seven
month
by
chancellor
who
were
not
nazi
even
though
the
nazi
were
the
largest
reichstag
parti
the
failur
of
these
men
to
achiev
a
work
coalit
wa
due
to
the
inabl
of
their
coalit
parti
to
work
togeth
here
how
william
shirer
put
it
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
third

the

error
of
the

wa
their
failur
to

against
it
at
the
crest
of
their
popular
strength
in
juli
the

socialist
had
attain
but
percent
of
the

but
the
percent
of
the
german
peopl
who
express
their
opposit
to
hitler
were
much
too
divid
and
shortsight
to
combin
against
a
common
danger
which
they
must
have
known
would
overwhelm
them
unless
they

the

but
that
doesnt
chang
the
fact
that
there

befor
he

the
