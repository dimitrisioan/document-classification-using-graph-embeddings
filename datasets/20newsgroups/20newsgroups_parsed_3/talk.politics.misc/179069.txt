scare
you
havent

involv
the
janu
report
which
came
out
recent
give
a
the
percentag
of
exclus
or
predominantli
gay
men
i
thumb
through
the
janu
report
in
a
bookstor
recent
look
for
a
clue
about
their
methodolog
they
were
veri
unclear
about
it
but
a
far
a
i
could
tell
they
reli
on
their
profession
associ
in
the
psychotherapi
profess
to
provid
the
subject
interview
and
number
if
so
thi
would
hardli
repres
an
averag
crosssect
i
post
to
usenet
at
the
time
ask
for
more
data
about
their
methodolog
but
answer
came
there
none
i
must
have
been
out
of
my
mind
for
even
ask
for
factual
inform
on
usenet
no
one
is
presum
go
to
say
theyr
gay
if
theyr
not
but
some
no
doubt
are
go
to
hide
their
homosexu
in
survey
thu
the
is
a
lower
limit
thi
is
the
problem
peopl
have
to
have
a
lot
of
confid
in
the
anonym
of
a
studi
befor
they
can
count
on
to
speak
freeli
about
stuff
like
that
but
i
agre
that
if
someon
go
to
lie
it
will
be
in
the
direct
of
a
gay
person
claim
to
be
straight
rather
than
the
other
way
around
i
still
say
that
weigh
all
the
evid
give
a
most
like
percentag
between
and
i
dont
see
whi
there
ani
more
evid
for
