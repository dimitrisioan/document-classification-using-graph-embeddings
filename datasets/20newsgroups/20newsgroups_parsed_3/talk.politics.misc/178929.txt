l
dare
write
again
they
cant
forc
a
privat
entiti
to
spring
to
life
to
pay
them
so
the
govern
by
sheer
econom
forc
ha
basic
clear
the
basiccar
market
for
itself
the
onli
way
to
test
thi
would
be
for
some
realli
dare
person
to
start
up
from
scratch
in
alberta
andor
quebec
a
health
insur
compani
offer
basic
care
crazi
ye
but
that
almost
how
mci
got
start
howev
the
concept
of
risk
is
well
known
by
insur
actuari
and
no
privat
firm
can
get
the
kind
of
amort
that
the
public
pool
can
get
and
sinc
health
insur
get
spent
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
the
insur
ceo
and
you
get
a
situat
like
in
the
u
where
rate
keep
go
up
to
catch
up
see
what
i
mean
it
a
govern
monopoli
sure
becaus
it
a
nonmarket
phenomenom
and
the
free
market
cant
solv
it
even
our
privat
insur
say
that
and
rememb
last
year
quebec
propos
give
the
least
riski
part
of
basic
care
to
the
privat
sector
and
they
balk
like
you
saidwhi
should
they
and
want
no
part
of
it
by
your
own
argument
if
you
dont
want
the
provinci
plan
your
basic
up
a
creek
ye
but
in
our
cultur
argu
against
it
is
like
argu
for
nation
defenc
by
mean
of
warlord
true
accord
to
poll
ive
read
usual
in
the
sort
of
simplemind
stuff
you
were
init
respond
to
someth
like
of
american
would
like
canadianstyl
health
care
wherea
onli
of
canadian
would
like
it
our
way
id
be
interest
to
know
whi
there
are
that
mani
of
canada
popul
is
about
a
million
or
so
peopl
canada
is
satur
by
american
medium
while
pundit
come
on
cabl
and
talk
about
how
aw
our
health
care
is
suppos
to
be
what
peopl
experi
up
north
end
up
not
differ
from
what
they
see
portray
on
american
televis
in
movi
ie
same
infrastructur
differ
insur
makeup
yet
they
know
not
of
ani
insur
problem
and
have
no
idea
of
what
an
hmo
is
but
have
lot
of
british
tv
a
well
they
know
that
they
dont
like
nh
someon
must
have
a
reason
to
argu
against
it
valid
or
notwhat
kind
of
peopl
are
they
the
poll
that
you
refer
to
for
the
canadian
data
are
from
the
annual
juli
st

the

have
been

and
probabl
will
again
im
sorta
suspici
myself
co
mayb
american
want
univers
coverag
like
canada
i
honestli
doubt
that
most
american
realiz
that
we
have
privat
doctor
and
public
and
privat
hospit
ie
similiar
health
care
infrastructur
and
our
system
is
basic
pure
insur
without
hmo
given
recent
turnaround
by
the
hiaa
endors
univers
coverag
and
hostil
to
corporatist
hmo
within
the
ama
and
the
complet
silenc
vi
a
vi
canadabash
by
the
ama
i
suspect
that
theyr
keep
the
secret
about
canada
up
their
sleev
exactli
wouldnt
you
until
the
idea
of
manag
competit
aros
there
wa
no
direct
threat
to
standalon
privat
practic
in
the
s
the
ama
fought
hmo
a
corporat
socialist
medicin
part
of
the
reason
whi
we
have
onli
insur
and
no
hmo
in
canada
co
that
wa
part
of
the
deal
cut
with
the
cma
ive
also
read
that
the
three
biggest
american
hmo
can
be
compar
straight
up
against
some
of
the
smaller
canadian
provinc
in
the
maritim
and
they
spend
someth
like
le
per
patient
mayb
it
doe
help
the
american
hmo
can
still
cream
and
they
probabl
cover
a
smaller
geograph
area
than
even
our
smallest
provinc
geographi
again
some
of
them
are
spread
out
across
the
whole
countri
i
think
but
each
site
is
probabl
compact
and
the
clientel
are
cream
and
dont
forget
that
hmo
place
cap
on
your
coverag
and
often
wont
tell
you
about

procedur
you
