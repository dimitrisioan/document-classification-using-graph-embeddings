hitler
mccarthi
jack
the
ripper
ted
bundi
and
a
whole
slew
of
individu
who
have
done
horribl
evil
thing
if
white
male
can
take
the
credit
for
our
fellow
white
male
boon
we
must
also
take
the
blame
for
our
fellow
blight
i
claim
we
deserv
neither
credit
nor
blame
for
these
thing
we
are
told
by
u
congresswoman
barbara
jordan
that
we
are
biolog
incap
of
compass
she
full
of
shit
we
are
told
by
susan
brownmil
that
were
all
rapist
and
that
all
we
are
she
full
of
shit
were
told
by
catherin
comin
that
a
fals
rape
charg
is
actual
good
for
u
she
full
of
shit
we
are
told
by
the
feminist
lawyer
that
we
are
not
to

trust
with
child
theyr
full
of
shit
we
are
told
by
newsweek
magazin
that
we
are
poor
sport
if
we
complain
newsweek
is
full
of
shit
the
point
ladi
and
gent
michael
is
not
entir
correct
in
hi
theori
that
becaus
member
of
our
race
and
gender
made
great
advanc
the
race
and
gender
a
a
whole
deserv
more
respect
than
they
receiv
white
male
do
deserv
to
be
treat
better
than
they
are
be
treat
but
not
for
that
reason
and
the
malebash
he
quot
are
repugn
hatemong
no
better
than
the
chauvinist
they
despis
so
no
one
right
a
usual
white
male
need
to
wake
up
and
realiz
that
theyr
be
unfair
ye
but
everyon
el
need
to
wake
up
and
realiz
that
be
unfair
right
back
is
disgust
racist
and
sexist
whi
cant
we
learn
to
treat
everyon
fairli
without
gener
what
stupid
gene
make
thi
so
difficult
id
like
to
buy
the
world
a
clue
the
word
that
is
miss
in
thi
whole
discours
is
not
the
b
word
or
the
h
word
or
even
the
n
or
w
word
it
is
the
l
word
loser
that
right
when
we
boil
all
the
crap
out
of
thi
argument
it
is
all
about
win
and
lose
and
noth
el
let
me
explain
rememb
the
eighti
no
excus
nobodi
who
can
handl
a
mail
buffer
can
claim
they
are
too
young
to
rememb
ronald
reagan
yet
the
eighti
were
about
how
america
learn
to
win
onc
again
then
wouldnt
you
know
we
won
so
well
that
there
wa
noth
left
to
win
no
cold
war
to
endur
no
nuclear
holocaust
no
more
world
to
conquer
we
forgot
about
outer
space
long
ago
the
kind
of
overwhelm
no
hold
bar
success
that
kill
alexand
the
great
ye
there
were
a
few
littl
problem
along
the
way
stock
market
meltdown
here
an
sl
bailout
there
a
few
revolt
and
crazi
middl
eastern
dictat
to
contend
with
but
a
tacitu
would
tell
ya
the
god
augustu
never
had
it
so
good
in
the
meantim
there
is
guilt
for
win
mayb
a
fear
that
one
doesnt
deserv
one
bounti
or
success
so
there
is
a
kinder
and
gentler
type
of
politician
these
day
bill
clinton
affirm
action
and
lot
of
discours
about
peopl
who
dont
get
it
for
those
of
u
in
the
win
busi
thi
kind
of
talk
is
mildli
irrit
but
there
is
still
no
suggest
of
lose
but
what
do
we
find
now
to
put
it
mildi
the
stereotyp
of
our
white
male
nonwinn
is
woodi
hay
in
the
rose
bowl
punch
out
photojournalist
when
those
california
fruit
and
nut
steal
anoth
one
with
a
hail
mari
pas
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
whole
idea
behind
three
yard
and
a
cloud
of
dust
is
to
wear
your
oppon
down
until
he
collaps
in
the
final
period
but
woodi
just
use
hi
fist
uzzi
seem
to
be
the
weapon
of
choic
these
day
who
is
dfen
anyway
the
answer
is
a
plain
a
the
horn
rim
on
your
face
the
guy
is
michael
dougla
pose
a
a
loser
thi
is
known
a
controversi
cast
but
that
baggi
shortsleev
white
shirt
sure
doe
look
natur
on
mike
doesnt
it
gordon
gekko
will
never
look
the
same
though
woodi
alway
dress
that
way
did
we
realli
expect
gekko
to
take
it
easi
and
enjoy
that
kind
of
wardrob
without
put
up
a
fuss
what
we
are
start
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
bash
dfen
is
the
same
game
a
bash
that
poor
african
american
slug
that
clint
eastwood
use
to
blow
away
all
the
time
a
that
archwasp
male
gender
georg
c
scott
declaim
american
tradit
love
to
win
they
love
a
winner
and
will
not
toler
a
loser
and
so
on
the
polit
implic
are
simpl
if
a
mani
socialist
and
democrat
do
you
consid
societi
a
finit
pie
to
a
apport
in
some
equit
way
then
you
have
to
worri
about
who
is
a
winner
and
who
is
a
loser
to
tell
whose
side
you
are
on
that
could
be
black
woman
today
asian
homosexu
tommorrow
and
ye
inde
white
men
some
yet
to
be
determin
day
when
the
balanc
of
the
pie
ha
final
swung
against
that
minor
or
you
can
just
blow
the
whole
thing
off
and
say
a
do
most
conserv
and
all
the
libertarian
and
act
is
if
you
didnt
care
who
win
and
who
lose
in
some
case
you
might
say
someth
about
make
sure
the
game
is
fair
equal
of
opportun
not
of
condit
in
the
latter
case
you
might
be
abl
to
identifi
yourself
a
a
neoconserv
or
a
neoliber
depend
on
how
much
you
want
to
limit
the
pot
either
way
you
go
the
way
of
the
winner
is
no
longer
the
way
to
be
popular
at
least
after
you
graduat
from
high
school
but
youll
still
be
popular
at
high
school
reunion
but
it
beat
be
a
nerd
a
i
would
imagin
michael
dougla
would
now
agre
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
onli
way
to
go
even
in
hollywood
which
treat
loser
wors
than
ani
other
place
in
america
except
for
new

and
washington

and
even
in

which
produc
alex
keaton
but
no
champion
footbal
team
in
the
eighti
and
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineti
id
like
to
see
more
winner
in
thi
societi
regardless
of
race
gender
religi
prefer
and
sexual
orient
mayb
we
should
even
let
a
few
more
of

be

we
should
definit
let
the
