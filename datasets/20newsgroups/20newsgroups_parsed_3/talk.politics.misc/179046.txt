waco
i
dont
want
to
attack
anyon
person
opinion
and
thu
have
not
includ
ani
articl
but
it
seem
to
me
incred
ridicul
and
pompou
for
someon
to
sit
back
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
and
point
finger
at
clinton
reno
the
fbi
or
whomev
first
of
all
it
is
a
kneejerk
judgement
the
fact
are
quit
muddl
at
thi
point
and
will
like
be
for
quit
a
while
secondli
thing
do
not
improv
by
point
blame
and
accusatori
finger
point
finger
is
a
destruct
action
if
everyon
sat
around
point
finger
all
the
time
noth
would
get
done
and
noth
would
ever
get
ani
better
and
despit
the
tragedi
we
can
learn
someth
from
thi
if
it
is
approach
in
a
construct
manner
doesnt
it
seem
that
work
togeth
is
more
product
than
work
against
one
anoth
thirdli
it
seem
incred
hypocrit
to
place
blame
given
the
benefit
of
hindsight
someth
that
those
who
made
the
decis
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
whi
not
give
them
the
courtesi
of
acknowledg
that
they
did
the
best
they
could
with
the
data
they
had
in
a
veri
veri
difficult
situat
some
respons
have
gone
so
far
to
suggest
that
the
action
were
done
without
regard
for
the
life
of
the
peopl
in
the
compound
give
me
a
break
be
part
of
the

not
the
problem
and
