your
not

so
much
a
be
coerc
into
one
insur
plan
no
it
is
option
a
it
is
option
for
doctor
to
accept
it
there
are
isol
relig
commun
in
particular
that
ask
for
exempt
and
one
email
from
a
christian
scientist
in
edmonton
verifi
for
me
that
it
is
inde
neg
option
i
guess
that
you
can
argu
that
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
particular
insur
but
so
far
ive
not
come
across
that
up
north
and
i
take
pain
to
keep
tab
with
news
from
home
it
option
but
what
if
you
dont
want
basic
coverag
on
the
govern
term
you
said
befor
that
if
you
opt
out
your
basic
uninsur
there
are
two
thing
at
work
here
the
public
insur
is
veri
wide
in
what
it
will
cover
a
the
amort
is
also
univers
no
privat
plan
can
boast
of
a
plan
that
fit
a
gaussian
curv
and
a
our
privat
sector
ha
discov
theyr
better
off
not
offer
insur
coverag
that
their
custom
are
go
to
use
and
that
turn
the
privat
insur
offer
the
frill
into
an
effect
cartelthey
dont
realli
need
to
compet
becaus
a
you
put
it
theyr
in
a
winwin
situat
and
theyr
guarante
to
turn
a
profit
believ
me
they
probabl
had
orgasm
when
they
figur
that
out
and
accord
to
my
sister
the
yuppi
they
pat
themselv
on
the
back
to
the
point
of
ungraci
at
chamber
of
commerc
luncheon
so
in
a
sens
theyv
stop
be
truli
capitalist
if
they
dont
have
to
worri
about
compet
anymor
you
might
say
that
the
total
effect
is
one
of
social
medicinea
govern
provid
the
basic
and
a
cartel
provid
the
extra
there
is
no
altern
to
the
system
desir
or
not
the
altern
to
the
system
is
no
system
at
all
patient
opt
out
doctor
opt
out
or
both
but
that
onli
for
insur
and
you
cant
forc
a
privat
insur
compani
to
sell
you
a
plan
that
they
will
not
offer
and
rememb
that
the
actual
health
care
is
deliv
by
privat
entiti
who
collect
from
the
public
insur
voluntarili
again
they
cant
forc
a
privat
entiti
to
spring
to
life
to
pay
them
plu
there
is
the
matter
of
cultur
and
valu
im
basic
antitax
and
antigovern
by
canadian
standard
yet
i
cant
bring
myself
to
make
the
same
argument
a
you
do
despit
that
i
understand
where
your

from

your
so
much
more
like
to

if

you

becaus
you
cant
hire
your
own
rambo
squad
instead
or
even
opt
out
a
a
pacifist
true
but
i
would
be
more
comfort
with
a
system
in
which
basic
care
provid
by
the
govern
wa
option
not
mandatori
in
canada
and
germani
it
not
mandatori
howev
it
is
neg
option
in
that
you
must
request
the
exempt
that
the
privat
sector
will
not
provid
privat
basic
coverag
if
offer
the
option
a
in
the
quebec
case
tell
me
someth
about
what
they
know
either
way
the
transient
situat
are
hard
to
deal
with
sinc
the
chang
in
the
privat
medic
care
resourc
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
abil
of
peopl
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disast
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
diseas
a
doctor
need
year
of
train
plu
internship
and
specialti
train
anoth
problem
with
the
u
system
that
should
be
resolv
doesnt
canada
have
someth
like
ten
time
the
proport
of
gp
to
specialist
that
the
u
doe
ye
but
part
of
the
reason
is
that
our
most
of
our
market
are
too
small
to
sustain
mani
specialist
sometim
not
even
one
so
you
pretti
well
have
to
be
a
gp
to
get
paid
and
if
you
do
get
the
train
the
doctor
monopoli
might
block
your
get
of
a
licenc
becaus
there
is
alreadi
someon
in
the
busi
and
who
can
not
fill
hisher
appoint
book
that
we
have
a
cma
doctor
monopoli
is
someth
that
the
american
amaori
medic
lobbi
never
tell
you
down
here
the
problem
is
in
a
specialti
your
skill
often
directli
correl
to
your
pay
a
good
cardiologist
make
more
than
a
mere
adequ
cardiologist
more
than
it
doe
in
gener
practic
in
that
circumst
it
hard
to
blame
peopl
for
go
into
specialti
no
i
respect
peopl
who
do
specialti
okay
all
of
my
md
friend
are
but
there
the
question
of
our
small
market
dynam
up
north
if
anyth
that
our
privat
doctor
and
hospit
sell
their
servic
to
american
to
gener
more
busi
will
inflat
their
effect
popul
serv
and
thu
make
some
specialti
final
viabl
ie
there
will
be
enough
custom
we
just
do
not
have
enough
sick
canadian
in
absolut
number
otherwis
i
person
think
an
approach
like
germani
would
be
bestwher
the
compani
compet
for
batch
of
peopl
rochest
a
littl
east
of
u
wa
abl
to
get
almost
all
of
it
popul
cover
that
way
uh
germani
basic
us
our
method
with
their
mani
sick
fund
the
competit
is
fake
if
it
exist
at
all
becaus
theyr
all
interlink
look

my
girlfriend
is
in
our
german
depart
and
her
uncl
is
a

while

germani
organ
the

rememb
that
we
have

that
have
the

popul
a
some
major

corpor
german
have
public
health

just
that
it
is

actual
brokerag
of

wholl
sell
extra
insur
to
fill

their

sort
of
a

wa
one
of
the

too
rememb
the
german
dont
have

a

co
rochest
doe
and
theyr
also
a
compani
town
but
there
wa
a
washington
post
articl
recent
about
that
that
said
canadian
doctor
often
use
myelogram
instead
of
mri
which
requir
spinal
inject
and
can
caus
seizur
and
headach
mickey
kau
in
the
new

probabl
spoke
for
most
american
when
he
said
who
need
that
i
think
peopl
here
gener
like
to
believ
they
can
easili
get
the
most
hightech
treatment
even
if
they
realli
cant
afford
it
ill
have
to
let
a
canadian
md
jump
in
to
verifi
that
claim
but
ive
come
to
learn
to
suspect
anyth
in
the
american
press
about
our
system
if
much
or
some
of
it
were
true
youd
have
to
take
u
for
idiot
for
toler
it
and
given
that
our

wa
instal
dure
a
period
when
there
were
onli
liber

tori
govern
feder
and
provinci
and
the
socialist
are
still
chafe
they
wouldv
press
for
real
social
medicin
to

think
about

after
