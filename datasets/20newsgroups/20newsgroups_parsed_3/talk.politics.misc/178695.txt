a
note
in
anoth
thread
limit
govt
the
problem
libertarian
face
is
insur
that
the
limit
govern
they
seek
doe
not
becom
the
tool
of
privat
interest
to
pursu
their
own
agenda
it
is
a
failur
of
libertarian
if
the
ideolog
doe
not
provid
ani
reason
way
to
restrain
such
action
other
than
utopian
dream
just
a
marxism
fail
to
specifi
how
pure
commun
is
to
be
achiev
and
the
state
is
to
wither
away
libertarian
frequent
fail
to
show
how
weaken
the
power
of
the
state
will
result
in

seem
to
me
to
be
a
utopian
dream
but
basic
human
decenc
and
common
sens
a
real
grassroot
exampl
of
freedom
and
liberti
and
ye
not
have
a
few
peopl
act
a

the
benefit
of
elimin
anticompetit
legisl
with

to
auto
dealer
barber
etc
one
need
not
howev
swallow
the
entir
libertarian
agenda
to
accomplish
thi
end
just
becaus
one
grant
the
benefit
of
allow
anyon
who
wish
to
cut
hair
to
sell
hisher
servic
without

doe
not

should
be

peopl
a
a

a

the

howev

that
the

avoid
all

it
strike
