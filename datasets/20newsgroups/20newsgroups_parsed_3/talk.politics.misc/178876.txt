becaus
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
differ
from
a

becaus
the

a
a

he
did
say
that
both
the

situat
the
ndp
clean
up
a
torus
spend
mess
and
just
when
i
thought
i
understood
canadian
polit
there
wa
one
about
a
group
of
doctor
in
calgari
who
have
open
canada
first
usstyl
mri
clinic
a
an
altern
to
the
provinci
own
one
it
about
time
ive
rag
on
my
own
doctor
friend
a
to
whi
they
dont
invest
in
their
own
privat
practic
in
the
end
it
their
money
but
they
choos
to
spend
it
on
america
cup
pipedream
and
that
none
of
my
busi
a
for
provinci
own
for
sure
it
against
the
law
in
canada
for
govern
to
be
directli
involv
in
the
provis
of
health
care
except
in
the
militari
or
nativ
reser
vation
what
that
term
actual
mean
is
that
the
facil
get
by
on
public
grant
to
meet
shortfal
from
lack
of
use
no
kid
medic
practic
itself
is
much
more
conserv
up
north
my
own
best
friend
did
two
clerkship
at
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochest
mn
and
is
no
stranger
to
high
tech
medicin
but
hi
boat
come
first
there
were
some
peopl
express
concern
that
it
wa
the
first
wedg
of
twotier
health
care
and
that
it
might
violat
the
canada
health
act
no
it
probabl
socialist
whiner
who
are
offend
that
we
have
privat
practic
and
alway
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyway
so
whi
not
have
a
particular
facil
the
canadian
big
govern
mental
often
imagin
govern
where
it
doe
not
even
exist
the
onli
potenti
problem
i
see
with
the
privat
mri
facilti
in
calgari
is
the
selfreferr
problem
to
the
facil
for
the
doctor
who
have
a
financi
interest
in
it
which
is
basic
unethicalbut
in
canada
becaus
of
our
small
popul
there
is
like
onli
to
be
a
few
privat
facil
involv
onli
a
small
number
of
doctor
and
thu
i
dont
think
the
selfreferr
problem
which
is
an
epidem
in
the
u
could
ever
get
out
of
hand
here
look
nobodi
stop
the
clinic
when
they
plan
on
the
mri
nobodi
stop
them
when
they
bought
it
nobodi
seem
to
be
stop
them
from
use
it
either
much
ado
about
noth
thank
good
that
hockey
playoff
have
start
it
is
an
experi
that
will
be
certainli
be
watch
care
while
it
seem
current
unjustifi
there
wa
one
anecdot
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstr
the
mri
he
show
an
imag
of
an
injur
knee
which
happen
to
belong
to
the
manag
of
the
bank
who
approv
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provinci
mri
then
anoth
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscl
would
have
atrophi
and
rehabilit
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tier
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exagger
somewher
becaus
the
gao
studi
of
canada
cite
often
on
usenet
did
not
find
access
to
mri
to
be
a
problem
ill
bet
the
doctor
is
reli
on
peopl
have
listen
to
american
trash
talk
on
cabl
so
that
he
can
puff
hi
chest
a
bit
there
are
alreadi
a
few
treatment
regimen
for
knee
injuri
without
reli
on
mri
unfortun
ive
had
a
few
and
im
not
a
banker
what
like
happen
is
the
sponsor
of
the
privat
mri
which
includ
doctor
anticip
that
alberta
would
need
more
mri
and
instead
of
wait
for
the
health
planner
to
realiz
they
need
anoth
one
or
two

they
would
have
a
