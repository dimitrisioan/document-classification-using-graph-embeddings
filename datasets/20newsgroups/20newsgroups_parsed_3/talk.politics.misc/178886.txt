subject
re
are
american
sexual
repress
in
articl
kennedi
jame
scot
write
recent
studi
have
shown
that
the
number
of
men
who
have
engag
in
homosexu
activ
in
the
last
decad
is
and
the
number
of
men
who
are
exclus
homosexu
is
these
figur
are
much
le
than
those
that
came
from
earlier
studi
that
show
that
homosexu
among
men
is
a
lot
higher
so
what
can
we
deduc
from
these
figur
are
there
a
lot
le
male
homosexu
than
there
use
to
be
or
are
men
perhap
woman
too
not
a
honest
a
they
use
to
be
about
there
sexual
presum
the
peopl
that
were
poll
in
you
mean
in
the
s
men
and
woman
were
much
more
open
about
their
homosexu
than
today
want
to
tri
that
one
again
thi
survey
were
assur
of
their
anonymn
so
they
should
have
answer
the
question
honestli
i
suppos
howev
it
could
be
that
gay
feel
so
repress
and
denigr
by
societi
that
they
didnt
feel
that
they
could
be
forthcom
about
there
sexual
in
someth
like
a
survey
if
thi
true
then
is
it
possibl
that
there
is
a
lot
more
gay
out
there
than
we
are
led
to
believ
perhap
if
american
were
more
open
about
there
sexualityi
think
most
american
arentthen
we
might
discov
that
there
are
realli
quit
a
few
more
peopl
out
there
who
are
orient
toward
the
same
sexmen
and
woman
includ
id
ventur
a
guess
that
there
is
a
lot
of
peopl
out
there
who
have
consid
have
a
relationship
with
someon
of
the
same
sex
at
some
point
in
there
life
mayb
they
didnt
take
their
long
serious
but
thi
doesnt
make
these
long
ani
le
valid
therefor
if
american
werent
so
repress
about
their
sexual
in
generala
i
believ
they
may
be
then
wed
see
a
lot
more
peopl
come
out
of
the
closet
you
mean
ignor
studi
after
studi
so
that
we
can
continu
to
accept
a
studi
kinsey
that
is
obvious
wrong
a
for
myself
im
a
heterosexu
and
ive
never
consid
have
sex
with
anoth
man
that
just
the
way
i
ami
could
have
just
a
easili
of
been
gay
i
suppos
one
of
the
big
debat
about
homosexu
is
whether
or
not
it
a
type
of
behavior
that
is
learn
or
if
one
is
just
born
that
way
imho
the
more
like
explan
is
that
it
some
combin
of
the
two
base
on
what
besid
your
own
warm
fuzzi
feel
here
someth
to
ponder
upon
have
ani
of
you
gaybash
out
there
ever
consid
that
homosexu
probabl
deem
their
sexual
orient
a
be
a
state
of
affair
that
is
just
a
much
an
intrins
and
natur
part
of
their
life
a
heterosexu
do
about
their
own
sexual
in
other
word
someon
who
is
truli
alcohol
share
that
feel
until
they
hit
bottom
gay
may
not
be
abl
to
live
ani
other
way
even
if
they
date
someon
of
the
opposit
sex
or
get
marri
in
their
heart
they
are
still
a
homosexu
likewis
if
someon
who
is
truli
heterosexu
form
a
relationship
with
someon
of
the
same
sex
then
they
are
still
a
heterosexu
even
though
outward
appear
may
suggest

and
patriot
unless
of
cours
the
problem
is
that
homosexu
is
a
form
of
mental
disord
caus
by
childhood
sexual
abus
a
a
number
of
recent
work
suggest
if
homosexu
would
stop
use
the
govern
to
impos
their
moral
on
other
antidiscrimin
law
and
leav
our
child
alon
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
privat
but
until
they
get
over
the
liber
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
govern
is
to
tell
peac
peopl
how
to
live
i
have
no
choic
but
to
continu
to
point
out
that
homosexu
is
not
an
altern
lifestyl
but
a
