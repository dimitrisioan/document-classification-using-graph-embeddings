the
hope
that
togeth
we
could
creat
more
opportun
and
insist
on
much
more

of
the
commit
made
by
mani
of

right
track
last

wa
travel
across

heartland
in
my
luxuri
bu
i
visit
seneca
high

the
principl
illustr
that
octaviu
ha
talk
about
that
for
million
of
american
young
peopl
it
is
realli
an
impedi
to
both
their
learn
and
their
abil
to
be
good
worker
to
draw
a
sharp
divid
line
between
what
is
work
and
what
is
learn
in
the
world
in
which
we
are
live
the
averag
young
person
will
chang
the
natur
of
work
seven
or
eight
time
in
a
lifetim
we
must
learn
to
merg
the
work
world
and
the
learn
world
much
better
and
we
must
determin
that
all
of
our
young
peopl
see
the
opportun
that
some
of
them
have
had
showcas
here
today
whether
your
in
busi
or
in
govern
or
in
educ
you
know
that
we
have
a
big
job
to
do
when
it
come
to
build
a
futur
that
realli
honestli
includ
opportun
for
all
of
our
peopl
there
are
still
a
lot
of
peopl
who
say
well
thing
are
pretti
good
here
in
washington
and
everyth
fine
the
best
thing
we
can
do
about
thi
whole
thing
is
noth
they
all
have
job
laughter
all
the
peopl
who
say
that
applaus
they
all
have
health
insur
they
all
have
a
pretti
good
educ
and
they
all
have
a
pretti
secur
knowledg
that
theyll
be
okay
no
matter
what
happen
i
say
that
not
to
be
either
polit
or
unduli
critic
but
to
point
out
that
one
of
the
great
challeng
of
thi
age
for
everi
advanc
nation
everyon
is
to
fulli
develop
the
capac
of
all
of
it
peopl
and
then
find
work
for
them
to
do
all
the
european
countri
have
higher
unemploy
rate
than
we
do
but
also
stronger
support
system
for
the
unemploy
the
japanes
unemploy
rate
ha
been
go
up
theyr
go
to
adopt
a
stimulu
that
even
if
you
count
it
in
it
most
rigor
term
is
three
or
four
time
bigger
than
the
one
that
i
have
propos
to
creat
job
in
west
germani
alon
the
unemploy
rate
is
now
about
a
high
a
our
thi
is
a
big
problem
for
advanc
nation
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
to
add
an
extra
employe
with
a
lot
of
pressur
from
lowwag
produc
in
other
countri
that
are
grow
their
own
economi
and
tri
to
provid
new
opportun
for
their
peopl
but
it
is
especi
import
for
america
for
two
reason
one
is
we
have
a
whole
lot
of
folk
who
unless
we
move
aggress
will
not
have
the
educ
and
skill
we
need
to
be
competit
and
product
in
a
nation
like
thi
the
second
is
even
if
we
educ
them
all
if
there
arent
job
they
will
be
rob
of
the
fruit
of
their
educ
labor
peopl
need
to
be
abl
to
work
in
thi
countri
applaus
we
have
alway
had
some
unemploy
and
inde
some
of
it
is
normal
youv
alway
got
some
peopl
leav
job
and
move
around
the
countri
and
do
first
one
thing
and
anoth
we
have
now
at
thi
moment
in
our
histori
the
necess
for
all
big
organ
includ
the
govern
to
reexamin
the
way
they
are
organ
and
who
ask
whether
there
are
too
mani
peopl
work
at
some
kind
of
job
but
in
the
whole
we
must
still
be
abl
to
creat
job
in
a
countri
like
america
to
provid
peopl
with
the
chanc
to
work
it
go
to
be
difficult
for
me
to
make
the
welfar
reform
propos
that
i
will
make
to
congress
in
the
next
coupl
of
month
it
go
to
be
hard
for
me
to
make
those
work
if
at
the
end
of
all
thi
work
to
get
off
welfar
there
isnt
a
job
applaus
so
we
have
two
task
one
is
to
develop
the
capac
of
the
american
peopl
to
perform
without
regard
to
race
or
incom
or
the
circumst
of
their
birth
the
other
is
to
make
sure
that
there
are
some
opportun
for
them
to
bring
to
bear
for
their
talent
and
to
be
reward
with
a
paycheck
it
is
a
great
challeng
i
do
not
pretend
that
all
of
the
answer
are
simpl
but
i
know
if
you
want
to
ask
the
american
peopl
all
of
them
to
be
more
respons
if
you
want
to
recreat
a
sen
of
commun
in
thi
countri
that
bridg
the
line
of
race
and
incom
and
region
you
have
got
to
have
opportun
in
that
mix
a
part
of
our
vision
for
america
ha
to
be
a
futur
for
everi
young
person
in
thi
countri
who
will
to
play
by
the
rule
and
work
hard
and
strive
for
the
end
of
the
rainbow
there
ha
to
be
someth
at
the
end
of
that
rainbow
and
that
is
what
we
are
basic
here
to
talk
about
today
what
can
we
all
do
a
partner
recogn
none
of
u
can
do
it
alon
to
develop
the
capac
of
our
peopl
to
succeed
wherev
they
live
and
whatev
their
background
and
then
what
can
we
do
to
make
sure
that
there
someth
there
for
them
to
do
the
summer
job
program
were
discus
today
is
an
integr
part
of
that
plan
becaus
it
will
promot
the
valu
of
work
and
opportun
and
fair
commun
it
will
put
the
peopl
first
and
it
doe
have
a
partnership
between
the
public
and
privat
sector
i
said
when
i
address
the
unit
state
congress
in
februari
on
thi
program
that
i
would
seek
to
creat
about
extra
summer
job
from
govern
sourc
and
then
challeng
the
american
busi
commun
to
meet
that
target
so
that
we
can
creat
more
than
a
million
new
summer
job
over
and
abov
what
had
been
creat
befor
mani
mani
peopl
have
respond
to
that
challeng
and
jerri
is
just
a
shine
exampl
of
that
which
ha
been
replic
in
thi
room
and
around
the
countri
peopl
who
are
go
to
do
more
than
they
otherwis
would
in
the
privat
sector
to
give
young
peopl
a
work
experi
and
it
is
terribl
import
i
want
to
emphas
that
thi
summer
job
program
is
part
of
an
overal
commit
to
increas
the
capac
of
the
american
peopl
from
retrain
defens
worker
who
lose
their
job
and
other
adult
who
need
to
acquir
new
skill
to
improv
the
transit
from
school
to
work
for
young
peopl
who
dont
go
to
colleg
but
do
need
at
least
two
year
of
posthigh
school
train
either
on
the
job
or
in
a
commun
colleg
or
a
vocat
set
so
that
they
can
be
competit
worker
make
it
possibl
for
more
peopl
to
go
on
to
colleg
who
do
want
to
go
all
these
thing
are
part
and
parcel
of
a
comprehens
plan
it
also
import
a
i
said
that
we
creat
more
job
the
emerg
job
program
that
i
ask
the
congress
to
adopt
would
creat
a
half
a
million
extra
job
over
the
next
year
and
a
half
and
that
would
reduc
the
unemploy
rate
by
a
half
a
percent
it
would
also
enabl
u
to
absorb
more
young
peopl
come
into
the
work
forc
in
job
that
otherwis
will
not
be
creat
it
also
will
help
a
lot
of
citi
and
counti
to
invest
in
thing
that
need
to
be
done
at
the
grassroot
level
project
long
delay
water
project
sewer
project
park
project
new
industri
and
particularli
in
small
and
medium
commun
a
whole
rang
of
thing
that
will
improv
the
economi
and
improv
the
environ
the
summer
job
program
is
an
import
part
of
that
becaus
we
have
tri
for
the
first
time
through
the
work
of
the
labor
depart
and
the
educ
depart
and
through
reach
out
to
peopl
like
you
to
make
thi
more
than
just
a
oneshot
summer
job
program
to
integr
it
with
privat
sector
effort
to
hope
replic
it
in
each
come
summer
to
move
these
young
peopl
into
further
educ
opportun
and
to
further
job
opportun
and
to
have
a
strong
meaning
educ
compon
to
these
summer
job
someth
that
the
unit
state
govern
ha
never
fulli
emphas
befor
a
lot
of
these
young
peopl
a
you
well
know
becaus
they
come
from
difficult
background
becaus
they
go
to
school
in
difficult
and
challeng
circumst
need
extra
help
in
build
their
basic
skill
in
math
and
languag
reason
and
in
other
area
and
a
lot
of
educ
studi
show
that
young
peopl
who
have
difficulti
in
school
often
forget
a
much
a
percent
of
what
they
learn
over
the
summer
and
then
that
ha
to
be
repeat
the
next
year
what
we
are
tri
to
do
here
is
to
give
peopl
the
opportun
to
learn
good
work
habit
and
to
reinforc
their
learn
skill
and
to
put
them
togeth
and
then
hope
over
the
next
coupl
of
year
if
our
entir
program
pas
to
give
everi
school
in
thi
countri
the
opportun
to
have
a

learn
environ
there
will
be
more
appli
academ
more
opportun
for
peopl
to
learn
and
work
dure
the
school
year
so
that
thi
will
not
simpli
be
an
isol
moment
for
these
young
folk
but
will
be
a
part
of
build
a
whole
new
educ
experi
a
whole

and
move
on
a
pathway
to
a

theyr
design
to

challeng
young

while

earn
but
let
them
earn
you
know
it
veri
difficult
to
make
a
case
to
peopl
who
have
never
seen

on

that
they
should
do
thi
that
or
the
other
thing
if
there
no
evid
of

that
at

but
if

go
to
summon

respons
you
have
to
reward
them
when
they
do
the
right
thing
with
opportun
applaus
the
young
peopl
we
propos
to
put
to
work
under
our
program
will
spend
hour
learn
basic
skill
such
a
math

book
stand
and
sold
two
trunk
full
of
comic
book
made
more
money
than
i
had
ever
had
in
my
life
but
if
i
had
save
those
trunk
theyd
be
worth
today
laughter
that
doe
not
mean
young
peopl
should
not
be
entrepreneuri
it
just
mean
that
you
cant
forese
a
gener
ahead
i
have
mow
yard
and
clear
land
and
built
hous
and
work
in
bodi
shop
and
the
part
depart
of
a
car
dealership
and
ive
done
a
lot
of
differ
thing
for
a
live
some
peopl
say
i
got
into
polit
to
escap
work
laughter
i
learn
someth
from
everi
job
i
ever
had
but
i
grew
up
in
a
gener
where
i
liter
did
not
know
a
live
soul
without
regard
to
race
or
incom
who
want
to
work
who
didnt
have
a
job
i
grew
up
in
a
gener
when
all
you
had
to
realli
say
to
peopl
is
get
an
educ
and
youll
be
all
right
youll
get
a
job
and
youll
make
more
money
next
year
than
you
did
thi
year
now
i
live
in
a
gener
full
of
peopl
most
of
whom
dont
make
ani
more
money
in
real
dollar
than
they
did
year
ago
and
theyr
work
longer
hour
and
theyr
pay
more
for
the
basic
of
life
and
we
are
now
wonder
whether
we
can
creat
the
job
that
these
young
peopl
want
now
i
want
to
close
by
reemphas
these
two
thing
it
doesnt
matter
what
kind
of
econom
polici
thi
administr
pursu
or
how
much
product
increas
there
are
in
the
privat
sector
if
young
american
dont
get
a
good
educ
dont
learn
how
to
work
and
cant
be
product
those
job
will
not
be
creat
in
thi
countri
machin
will
do
the
work
or
the
work
will
be
done
offshor
by
peopl
who
have
the
same
skill
level
and
can
work
for
a
third
or
a
fourth
or
a
fifth
the
wage
so
noth
we
can
do
econom
will
matter
unless
we
build
the
skill
and
capac
of
america
work
forc
and
anybodi
that
pretend
otherwis
is
just
kid
