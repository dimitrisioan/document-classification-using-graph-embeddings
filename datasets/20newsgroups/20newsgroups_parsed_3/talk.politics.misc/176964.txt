im
a

white
aryan
lap
cathol
dbaba
duan
m
hentrich
i
would
like
to
go
on
record
a
object
to
mr
hentrich
call
himself
an
aryan
the
word
aryan
is
of
sanskrit
origin
and
occur
first
in
the
hindu
scriptur
the
rigveda
it
seem
to
have
been
a
tribal
term
but
may
have
had
connot
of
good
charact
such
connot
are
quit
explicit
in
the
say
of
the
buddha
who
call
hi
religion
the
eightfold
aryan
path
the
word
wa
borrow
by
the
german
scholar
max
mueller
who
use
it
a
a
synonym
for
indoeuropean
but
then
the
nazi
proceed
to
steal
it
and
start
pretend
that
aryan
is
synonym
with
nordic
which
seem
highli
unlik
the
peopl
who
origin
call
themselv
arya
the
iranian
noprth
indian
the
afghan
and
possibl
the
kurd
are
none
of
them
nordic
so
the
use
of
the
word
by
western
though
meant
with
appar
good
humor
in
thi
case
is
nontheless
inappropri
the
onli
western
who
may
have
some
claim
to
call
themselv
aryan
by
descent
are
the
celt
who
seem
to
have
wor
ship
a
god
call
aryaman
who
is
mention
in
the
rigveda
if
you
want
to
check
what
i
am
say
look
at
mallori
book
in
search
of
the
indoeuropean
or
just
look
at
the
encyclopedia
britannica
the
reason
thi
usag
is
offens
is
that
most
of
ancient
indian
literatur
a
well
a
religion
is
directli
or
inderectli
due
to
the
aryan
and
for
western
to
butt
in
is
realli
not
nice
not
to
mention
the
horribl
thing
done
by
german
to
jew
use
a
word
to
which
the
german
have
no
clear
claim
