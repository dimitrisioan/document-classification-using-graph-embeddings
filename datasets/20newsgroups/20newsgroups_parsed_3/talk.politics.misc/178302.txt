think
about
it
shouldnt
all
drug
then
be
legal
it
would
lower
the
cost
and
definit
make
them
safer
to
use
ye
i
dont
think
we
want
to
start
use
these
criterion
to
determin
legal
whi
not
where
do
they
get
these
peopl
i
realli
dont
want
to
wast
time
in
here
to
do
battl
about
the
legal
of
drug
if
you
realli
want
to
we
can
get
into
it
and
prove
just
how
idiot
that
idea
is
you
ask
a
question
and
now
you
dont
want
peopl
to
answer
i
believ
a
legitim
question
wa
ask
whi
shouldnt
cost
and
safeti
be
use
at
least
in
part
to
determin
legal
id
like
to
see

prove
that
drug
legal
is
an
idiot
idea

point
wa
that
it
is
pretti
stupid
to
justifi
legal
someth
just
becaus
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
a
few

fail
miser
to
meet
both
criterion
safer
