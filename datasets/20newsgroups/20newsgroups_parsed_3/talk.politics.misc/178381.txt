write
im
not
im
in
canada
we
have
far
fewer
shoot
like
thi
we
have
had
i
believ
one
mass
murder
in
the
last
twenti
year
im
not
go
to
say
we
dont
have
our
gun
problem
but
we
do
have
the
world
largest
undefend
boarder
with
one
of
the
most
gunhappi
countri
in
the
world
i
think
canada
illustr
that
gun
control
doe
have
an
effect
in
fact
it
supris
that
there
is
ani
differ
consid
how
easi
it
is
to
smuggl
a
gun
from
the
u
ye
it
amaz
isnt
it
in
fact
it
should
tell
you
that
gun
control
is
not
the
reason
your
crime
rate
is
low
sinc
ani
idiot
can
smuggl
gun
into
canada
from
the
u
at
ani
time
i
think
paul
wa
tri
to
make
the
point
that
ani
idiot
doesnt
there
are
sure
some
idiot
who
do
smuggl
gun
but
paul
seem
to
feel
that
the
exi
tenc
of
stricter
gun
control
law
ha
had
a
deterr
effect
thi
seem
a
strang
argument
to
make
consid
that
canada
violent
crime
rate
in
gener
is
far
lower
than
that
of
the
u
our
nongun
crime
rate
is
greater
than
their
entir
crime
rate
it
would
seem
strang
to
suggest
that
it
to
were
the
result
of
gun
control
law
i
think
if
we
look
wed
find
veri
specif
cultur
and
enforc
reason
whi
the
nongun
rate
is
low
a
well
and
then
that
reason
could
be
appli
to
the
withgun
rate
a
easili
given
that
most
crimin
use
gun
are
either
legal
purchas
or
stolen
from
those
who
purchas
them
legal
have
more
restrict
on
legal
posse
doe
seem
to
have
the
effect
of
reduc
gunrel
crime
asid
from
the
fact
that
i
find
the
idea
of
be
punish
becaus
somebodi
might
steal
someth
from
me
and
go
and
commit
a
crime
with
it
a
silli
solut
it
still
doesnt
address
the
question
of
canada
which
is
now
by
the
way
blame
their
rise
guncrim
rate
on
the
u
strang
that
the
border
use
to
magic
keep
the
gun
out
but
now
isnt
it
certainli
make
sen
that
it
would
well
it
make
sen
to
some
of
u
anyway
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
cours
is
that
far
illeg
drug
are
purchas
legal
or
stolen
from
peopl
who
purchas
them
legal
ive
still
not
been
convinc
that
gun
a
commod
which
crimin
have
shown
their
perfectli
will
to
pay
for
from
illeg
sourc
stolen
either
from
polic
militari
or
civilian
we
wouldnt
simpli
see
south
american
sourc
from
which
drug
come
start
smuggl
gun
a
well
sinc
there
a
thrive
gun
manufactur
industri
down
there
if
you
would
just
look
a
littl
closer
at
the
crime
statist
you
would
realiz
that
our
nongun
crime
rate
is
also
veri
high
so
gun
per
se
are
not
the
issu
directli
contradict
by
the
nejm
studi
that
compar
crime
in
seattl
and
vancouv
bc
the
nongun
rate
were
roughli
the
same
for
both
citi
the
differ
in
violent
crime
rate
wa
almost
total
gunrel
and
a
wa
not
point
out
in
the
studi
but
in
critiqu
of
it
two
seper
articl
by
jame
wright
and
david
kopel
come
to
mind
it
wa
point
out
that
the
differ
wa
also
almost
entir
minor
relat
that
is
the
gun
crime
rate
skyrocket
for
poor
minor
black
and
hispan
primarili
while
when
you
compar
the
white
major
they
were
virut
ident
the
problem
with
the
nejm
studi
wa
they
compar
minor
v
nonminor
percentag
but
fail
to
take
into
account
the
rel
condit
of
those
minor
that
there
wa
an
eqaul
percentag
of
nomnwhit
wa
about
a
far
a
they
went
they
fail
to
take
into
account
that
the
nonwhit
in
either
citi
were
not
live
in
the
same
condit
if
the
situat
wa
entir
base
on
avail
of
gun
then
wed
expect
that
the
white
rate
the
two
group
which
are
arguabl
fairli
compar
in
the
two
citi
would
have
a
far
higher
rate
in
seattl
yet
the
major
in
seattl
is
not
onli
not
significantli
higher
when
the

the

a

washington

true
but
that

similarli
for

the

is
not

a

did
the

violent

sinc
it
gone
up

often
faster
than

befor
you

dismiss
the

wa

may
be

the

out
