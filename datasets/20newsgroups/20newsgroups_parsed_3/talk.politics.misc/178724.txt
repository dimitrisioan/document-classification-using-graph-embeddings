the

the

in

the

right
out

in

everi

in

it
call
freedom
if
they
dont
like
the

they
can
tri
to

and
persuad
their

a
to
whi
the
thing
that
theyr
see
other
peopl
do
are
wrong
or
bad
right
and
peopl
would
not
rescind
ani
freedom
read
empow
the
govern
except
through
the
amend
process
that
is
how
the
feder
govern
is
suppos
to
work
now
but
the
suprem
soviet
er
i
mean
the
suprem
court
put
a
stop
to
that
republican
govern
nonsens
in
my
hypothet
govern
if
there
were
a
constitut
provis
empow
the
govern
to
regul
church
the
govern
whatev
level
we
are
talk
about
could
inde
ban
church
the
constitut
provis
would
be
invalid
if
a
higher
level
had
a
constitut
provis
protect
free
exercis
of
religion
the
uppermost
constitut
is
still
the
suprem
law
of
the
land
i
find
it
interest
that
you
applaud
the
idea
of
freemarket
competit
among
variou
idea
and
yet
support
the
right
of
he
major
in
a
commun
to
suppress
idea
which
they
dont
like
it
is
a
matter
of
individu
be
abl
to
control
their
own
associ
and
environ
not
a
matter
of
suppress
of
idea
one
dilemma
of
the
human
condit
is
that
individu
need
liberti
and
they
also
need
to
have
some
control
over
their
environ
in
my
fractal
feder
govern
certain
right
are
protect
by
the
constitut
other
right
are
protect
simpli
becaus
the
govern
ha
not
been
empow
to
infring
upon
them
when
a
consensu
is
reach
that
the
govern
should
have
a
certain
power
then
freedom
is
infring
upon
thi
can
not
be
avoid
murder
statut
infring
upon
freedom
but
i
think
that
the
consensu
of
the
american
peopl
is
that
murder
statut
are
a
good
idea
i
am
sure
that
mani
parent
believ
that
they
have
a
right
to
control
the
environ
that
their
child
live
in
peopl
feel
that
they
have
a
right
to
sleep
peac
at
night
thu
there
are
nois
ordin
there
are
zone
law
that
keep
busi
from
overrun
residenti
neighborhood
i
do
not
view
these
a
bad
thing
certainli
some
individu
instanc
are
bad
but
the
concept
is
not
necessarili
bad
i
view
them
a
the
peopl
in
a
commun
have
some
control
over
the
type
of
commun
that
they
live
in
i
see
the
altern
a
near
anarchi
like
i
said
in
anoth
post
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
scenario
where
an
individu
can
do
someth
truli
autonom
with
absolut
zero
effect
on
anyon
el
then
no
individu
or
govern
ha
the
right
to
restrict
that
activ
there
are
simpli
not
veri
mani
behavior
that
fit
into
the
categori
of
the
truli
autonom
so
the
whole
thing
becom
an
issu
of
one
individu
or
group
have
power
over
anoth
individu
or
group
i
think
that
the
fractal
feder
approach
is
a
sound
if
not
ideal
approach
to
limit
thi
restrict
power
the
libertarian
scenario
degener
to
might
make
right
and
the
system
we
have
right
now
is
one
of
lawyer
abus
natur
right
philosophi
to
decid
what
power
the
govern
should
have
by
subvert
the
democrat
process
though
the
suprem
court
the
problem
with
the
egalitarian
view
is
that
it
tri
to
deni
the
fundament
dilemma
of
democrat
govern
the
peopl
have
a
right
to
exercis
a
voic
in
their
commun
yet
individu
have
the
right
to
be
left
to
themselv
thi
is
a
seriou
dilemma
precis
becaus
there
is
not
much
that
take
place
in
a
vacuum
oddli
enough
if
what
you
say
is
taken
liter
there
is
littl
or
no
conflict
the
peopl
do
inde
have
a
right
to
exercis
a
voic
where
voic
equal
persuas
speech
in
their
commun
it
onli
when
they
somehow
get
the
idea
into
their
head
that
they
also
have
a
right
to
dictat
behavior
in
their
commun
that
the
troubl
begin
i
think
i
answer
thi
abov
alreadi
but
let
me
expand
a
littl
more
with
an
exampl
if
i
stand
nake
in
front
of
your
hous
and
masturb
in
front
of
your
child
while
they
play
in
your
libertarian
small
l
scenario
the
onli
recours
you
have
is
to
yell
at
me
autonom
is
a
valu
judgement
of
the
time
it
is
not
a
scientif
realiti
with
a
clear
definit
exactli
who
would
you
empow
to
make
that
valu
judgement
stuff
delet
certainli
not
the
onli
caus
mike
but
peopl
in
a
local
neighborhood
should
have
a
voic
in
what
goe
on
in
that
neighborhood
to
deni
thi
is
to
creat
anoth
concentr
central
power
to
keep
the
local
from
abus
it
power
in
essenc
use
a
pit
bull
to
keep
a
toy
poodl
from
bite
your
leg
chanc
are
the
pit
bull
is
go
to
turn
on
you
some
day
and
you
have
much
le
defens
against
it
than
you
do
against
the
toy
poodl
the
argument
here
appear
to
be
that
tyranni
of
the
individu
by
the
local
major
is
superior
to
have
the
feder
govern
have
and
exercis
the
power
to
protect
the
individu
from
hi
neighbor
becaus
that
feder
govern
will
eventu
and
inevit
becom
corrupt
and
use
it
power
to
tyrann
everyon
okay
there
a
lot
of
truth
in
that
certainli
were
see
someth
like
that
happen
in
the
unit
state
today
though
it
unclear
that
he
progress
here
match
the
model
sinc
our
belov
and
benign
feder
govern
hasnt
evershown
much
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
of
protect
ani
individu
lot
of
peopl
are
long
on
complaint
and
short
on
practic
solut
although
i
am
pessimist
that
my
idea
will
ever
bear
fruit
i
am
at
least
tri
to
be
long
on
solut
also
i
am
truli
interest
if
you
have
ani
improv
to
make
on
my
idea
i
call
them
my
idea
but
they
all
come
from
an
averag
guy
read
of
the
u
constitut
without
benefit
of
the
indoctrin
of
constitut
law
academia
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
your
solut
is
at
least
just
a
bad
trade
the
yoke
of
feder
tyranni
for
the
yoke
of
local
tyranni
doesnt
cheer
me
up
much
i
think
id
prefer
to
put
my
faith
in
a
larger
govern
that
at
least
might
protect
the
individu
from
time
to
time
rather
than
place
it
in
local
mob
rule
admittedli
it
the
lesser
of
two
evil
and
it
not
le
by
veri
much
and
theyr
both
pretti
damn
evil
sorri
the
confus
wa
my
fault
when
i
said
that
fractal
feder
resembl
the
u
constitut
i
meant
it
and
thought
it
wa
pretti
clear
i
should
have
more
clearli
explain
that
the
ultim
deriv
of
govern
power
is
from
the
consensu
of
the
peopl
although
not
the
consent
of
everi
individu
a
practic
observ
not
a
moral
judgement
it
is
certainli
better
than
have
all
govern
power
deriv
from
nine
lawyer
which
is
the
situat
we
have
now
that
is
whi
i
think
the
suprem
court
should
be
a
juri
court
with
a
differ
juri
for
each
case
it
is
certainli
not
perfect
no
philosophi
of
govern
is
but
do
you
still
find
it
a
repugn
idea
if
so
what
is
your
solut
ideal
everyon
would
leav
everyon
el
alon
and
no
govern
coerciv
power
of
ani
kind
would
be
necessari
thi
will
never
work
becaus
peopl
are
differ
and
by
their
natur
they
will
alway
want
to
forc
their
view
on
other
if
thi
were
not
the
case
nobodi
would
tri
to
forc
their
view
that
murder
is
wrong
on
anyon
el
thi
is
true
the
question
is
what
we
you
go
to
do
about
it
your
propos
solut
seem
to
actual
encourag
these
bozo
to
lord

i
think
that
you
misunderstood
the

it
