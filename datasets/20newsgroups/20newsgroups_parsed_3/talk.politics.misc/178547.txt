talk
with
ani
republican
senat
yesterday
about
the
stimulu
packag
m
myer
he
spoke
with
senat
dole
q
how
mani
time
m
myer
i
believ
onc
dure
the
day
and
onc
last
night
q
what
wa
the
outcom
of
that
m
myer
theyr
continu
to
work
toward
some
kind
of
an
agreement
on
a
job
packag
q
is
it
your
impress
that
senat
dole
is
in
ani
way
flexibl
on
thi
m
myer
well
i
think
were
hope
that
were
go
to
get
some
kind
of
job
packag
through
the
senat
and
well
continu
to
work
with
senat
dole
and
other
until
we
reach
some
kind
of
an
agreement
q
did
they
discu
the
vat
tax
m
myer
i
dont
know
if
that
came
up
q
can
you
check
that
m
myer
sure
q
so
what
are
they
is
the
presid
offer
to
scale
down
hi
program
is
that
what
he
tri
to
do
buy
it
down
to
where
dole
will
sign
on
m
myer
well
he
tri
to
protect
a
much
of
it
a
he
can
but
it
import
to
him
to
get
some
kind
of
a
job
packag
through
the
senat
and
through
congress
now
and
a
soon
a
we
reach
some
conclus
on
that
well
let
you
know
but
at
the
moment
he
continu
to
consult
with
member
of
congress
includ
obvious
senat
dole
q
is
he
talk
to
anybodi
els
m
myer
i
dont
believ
he
talk
to
ani
other
republican
yesterday
q
is
he
talk
to
anybodi
today
m
myer
i
dont
think
anyth
is
schedul
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
we
were
led
to
believ
that
the
presid
call
mr
dole
on
the
subject
of
russian
aid
and
that
bob
dole
brought
the
convers
around
to
stimulu
packag
is
that
correct
m
myer
i
think
the
presid
ha
contact
sever
peopl
on
russian
aid
i
think
that
it
wa
alway
expect
that
the
stimulu
packag
or
the
job
packag
will
be
part
of
ani
convers
he
would
have
with
senat
dole
the
primari
object
of
the
convers
wa
russian
aid
that
wa
the
first
order
of
busi
but
it
wa
both
q
in
the
presid
mind
are
they
link
polit
in
that
if
the
republican
continu
to
reject
the
stimulu
packag
he
think
it
will
be
harder
to
sell
russian
aid
to
the
american
peopl
ha
he
made
that
argument
m
myer
i
cant
talk
about
specif
what
argument
he
might
have
made
the
presid
is
obvious
commit
to
both
he
like
to
see
a
job
packag
to
the
american
peopl
first
but
a
you
know
we
outlin
the
detail
of
addit
russian
aid
last
night
in
tokyo
q
but
doe
the
presid
believ
that
the
stimulu
packag
will
make
it
more
difficult
to
persuad
american
to
vote
for
russian
to
accept
a
vote
for
russian
aid
m
myer
i
think
that
the
presid
is
go
to
continu
to
work
to
pa
the
stimulu
packag
to
pa
a
job
packag
and
were
still
hope
that
well
get
some
kind
of
job
packag
through
the
congress
q
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
presid
is
negoti
now
with
dole
m
myer
he
discuss
option
with
him
q
on
the
stimulu
is
it
your
understand
that
over
the
break
some
democrat
themselv
have
left
the
support
that
they
had
earlier
for
the
packag
the
stimulu
packag
m
myer
i
think
we
still
have
wide
support
in
the
senat
for
the
job
packag
q
but
specif
that
youv
lost
democrat
other
than
shelbi
m
myer
i
dont
believ
so
there
hasnt
been
a
vote
q
what
about
kohl
q
kohl
and
feingold
m
myer
there
hasnt
been
a
vote
yet
and
well
continu
to
work
with
senat
to
tri
to
get
a
major
to
tri
to
bring
the
packag
to
a
vote
becaus
we
believ
that
a
major
of
the
member
of
the
unit
state
senat
support
the
packag
q
if
your
werent
worri
about
kohl
and
feingold
whi
did
georg
mention
milwauke
project
the
other
day
m
myer
i
think
georg
point
out
a
number
of
project
in
a
number
of
state
that
stand
to
be
fund
or
to
lose
fund
if
thi
job
packag
doesnt
pa
q
no
democrat
laughter
m
myer
ill
let
you
draw
your
own
conclus
q
doe
he
plan
to
talk
to
dole
again
today
or
ani
other
republican
again
today
m
myer
there
noth
specif
schedul
but
again
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
doe
he
plan
to
put
out
ani
more
press
releas
to
ani
other
state
today
m
myer
what
weve
done
is
were
in
the
process
of
break
down
the
benefit
of
the
job
packag
state
by
state
i
think
it
entir
feasibl
that
a
we
sort
of
are
abl
to
sum
those
up
well
send
out
press
releas
to
the
variou
state
that
suggest
how
their
state
would
benefit
from
thi
packag
q
will
you
share
those
with
u
m
myer
sure
a
we
did
yesterday
q
do
you
have
copi
of
the
one
you
sent
m
myer
ye
we
made
those
avail
yesterday
and
we
certainli
can
continu
to
provid
them
today
q
dee
dee
sinc
yesterday
question
and
subsequ
stori
about
the
vat
what
further
consider
of
thi
issu
ha
been
given
m
myer
noth
chang
sinc
yesterday
i
think
the
presid
comment
on
it
thi
morn
to
say
onli
that
it
wa
someth
he
knew
wa
be
consid
by
the
task
forc
and
that
he
ha
not
made
a
decis
on
and
i
dont
think
we
have
anyth
to
add
to
that
q
but
he
also
said
that
busi
and
labor
group
are
tell
him
they
support
it
can
you
tell
u
m
myer
i
think
that
there
ha
been
im
not
go
to
specul
on
who
support
it
i
think
the
presid
said
that
there
ha
been
some
support
among
busi
and
labor
group
i
dont
think
he
said
he
wa
directli
contact
by
them
q
are
we
to
take
that
to
mean
that
the
administr
ha
sound
out
busi
and
labor
group
on
thi
m
myer
i
think
there
been
plenti
of
public
discours
on
thi
over
the
year
and
even
recent
but
i
dont
think
i
want
to
add
to
that
q
in
februari
though
the
presid
said
that
thi
wa
someth
to
be
consid
or
year
down
the
road
what
ha
happen
between
then
and
now
to
caus
thi
administr
to
chang
it
mind
m
myer
i
think
a
we
said
yesterday
it
is
someth
that
the
work
group
are
look
at
theyr
consid
a
wide
varieti
of
option
on
everyth
from
fund
to
specif
option
that
will
be
cover
by
the
presid
health
care
plan
the
presid
ha
not
taken
it
up
yet
ha
not
made
a
decis
on
it
and
beyond
that
i
dont
have
anyth
to
add
q
you
havent
answer
the
question
it
wasnt
be
consid
by
anyon
in
the
white
hous
after
the
presid
comment
in
februari
and
georg
reaffirm
that
in
a
brief
q
and
then
suddenli
q
what
happen
m
myer
the
work
group
a
we
have
said
throughout
we
instruct
to
consid
a
wide
varieti
of
option
acrosstheboard
and
one
of
the
thing
that
ha
been
talk
about
and
that
they
are
clearli
consid
is
some
kind
of
a
valuead
tax
q
but
the
presid
himself
took
thi
off
the
tabl
dee
dee
and
suddenli
it
reappear
and
thi
go
to
the
credibl
of
thi
administr
in
a
way
what
ha
happen
in
the
meantim
m
myer
the
presid
ha
not
look
at
thi
it
hasnt
been
present
to
him
again
yet
the
work
group
are
look
at
it
a
theyr
look
at
a
wide
varieti
of
option
and
no
decis
have
been
made
q
and
it
rais
the
question
of
how
independ
the
task
forc
is
work
m
myer
the
task
forc
wa
instruct
to
consid
all
option
and
theyv
taken
that
mandat
serious
and
theyr
consid
all
option
q
but
that
not
the
impress
that
the
presid
left
in
februari
the
impress
he
left
wa
that
thi
wa
someth
that
wa
longrang
to
be
look
at
year
down
the
road
the
clear
implic
of
hi
remark
wa
that
thi
wa
someth
that
wa
not
on
the
tabl
not
an
option
q
if
it
chang
ill
tell
you
q
bring
him
on
q
and
you
repeatedli
refer
to
the
presid
remark
tell
u
that
those
were
still
in
oper
m
myer
it
chang
and
we
told
you
laughter
q
but
that
what
alic
rivlin
comment
and
donna
shalala
comment
were
about
i
mean
that
seem
like
an
orchestr
effort
becaus
you
have
two
independ
cabinet
offic
m
myer
i
wouldnt
no
alic
rivlin
not
a
cabinet
member
first
of
all
second
of
all
it
wa
not
orchestr
but
clearli
they
both
said
yesterday
and
in
the
last
coupl
of
day
that
it
someth
that
be
look
at
we
confirm
that
yesterday
and
i
dont
have
anyth
to
add
to
that
q
is
it
becaus
he
ha
veri
few
option
q
is
thi
someth
that
it
will
be
incumb
upon
the
task
forc
to
convinc
the
presid
about
in
other
word
ha
the
presid
himself
person
rule
it
out
and
it
now
up
to
the
task
forc
to
convinc
him
to
put
it
back
on
the
tabl
or
is
it
in
fact
back
on
the
tabl
have
been
place
there
by
discuss
with
the
presid
m
myer
it
is
not
the
work
group
mission
at
thi
point
to
convinc
the
presid
of
anyth
it
is
their
mission
to
put
befor
him
hi
option
and
to
explain
the
benefit
and
the
cost
and
the
basic
pro
and
con
of
each
of
those
option
i
think
that
they
will
certainli
present
the
vat
to
him
in
that
context
and
at
thi
point
he
not
that
present
ha
not
been
made
but
it
someth
that
he
will
hear
and
he
ha
not
made
a
decis
on
q
they
will
present
it
to
him
a
one
of
hi
option
though
he
specif
rule
it
out
m
myer
correct
q
dee
dee
is
thi
more
than
a
trial
balloon
is
thi
a
seriou
consider
that
the
work
group
are
give
to
thi
form
of
taxat
m
myer
it
simpli
a
statement
of
fact
the
work
group
are
consid
a
wide
varieti
of
option
on
a
number
of
issu
relat
to
health
care
reform
one
of
the
option
that
theyr
look
at
is
the
vat
q
dee
dee
when
the
work
group
were
examin
thi
possibl
wa
thi
on
the
tabl
dure
the
same
time
period
that
you
were
tell
u
that
it
wa
not
m
myer
i
dont
know
what
the
specif
time
of
their
draft
of
option
is
i
dont
know
q
who
wa
tell
you
that
it
wa
not
under
consider
m
myer
i
wa
refer
back
to
the
presid
comment
q
have
they
discov
that
the
sin
tax
wont
rais
enough
money
to
fund
the
core
benefit
packag
m
myer
no
there
no
decis
that
have
been
made
on
how
to
pay
for
the
health
care
plan
q
im
ask
whether
the
project
m
myer
there
a
number
of
option
depend
on
how
the
plan
is
structur
you
cant
decid
how
much
the
plan
is
go
to
cost
until
you
decid
what
the
plan
is
go
to
look
like
and
so
you
cant
discu
what
financ
option
have
been
rule
in
our
out
until
you
know
q
dee
dee
weve
been
told
that
they
have
a
comput
model
on
a
number
of
possibl
packag
m
myer
correct
q
the
question
is
whether
they
have
now
determin
whether
sin
tax
would
not
produc
enough
money
for
even
the
barest
minimum
packag
that
is
not
a
veri
difficult
comput
m
myer
it
is
a
question
that
you
know
that
were
not
go
to
answer
until
there
a
number
of
option
be
consid
it
depend
on
how
the
packag
is
structur
the
exact
detail
of
the
packag
and
the
financ
mechan
use
to
pay
for
them
are
all
among
the
decis
that
have
yet
to
be
made
q
and
when
the
presid
ha
been
meet
with
health
care
hi
health
care
advisor
which
we
are
told
he
ha
been
do
m
myer
correct
q
they
have
never
onc
said
to
him
these
are
your
fund
option
includ
the
vat
he
ha
never
heard
the
word
vat
in
hi
m
myer
i
am
not
go
to
comment
on
the
specif
natur
of
the
daili
theyr
not
daili
but
the
quasiregular
brief
q
well
you
have
m
myer
i
have
not
other
than
to
say
that
he
not
consid
the
vat
and
i
think
that
is
a
true
statement
q
no
but
you
said
that
it
ha
not
been
present
to
him
a
an
option
m
myer
correct
q
that
doesnt
mean
he
hasnt
heard
about
it
m
myer
im
not
go
to
get
into
the
detail
of
what
discuss
i
think
that
statement
stand
for
itself
q
specif
dee
dee
when
you
say
he
hasnt
look
at
it
do
you
mean
that
he
hasnt
look
at
it
in
term
of
pay
for
medic
coverag
or
hasnt
look
at
it
in
gener
becaus
back
in
chilicoth
he
wa
veri
specif
in
defin
how
it
work
what
the
advantag
are
the
whole
thing
it
sound
like
m
myer
but
that
wa
i
think
in
chilicoth
if
you
go
back
to
hi
remark
there
it
wa
a
broader
philosoph
discuss
of
the
tax
structur
and
i
think
the
comment
were
gener
in
refer
to
the
overal
econom
plan
but
clearli
it
someth
that
he
thought
about
in
the
broad
context
i
mean
that
wa
clear
in
chilicoth
what
im
say
is
that
in
the
process
of
the
work
group
it
someth
that
he
hasnt
consid
yet
it
someth
that
the
work
group
will
present
to
him
among
the
number
