nc
verdict
thoma
farrel
write
so
you
feel
that
the
defend
should
have
been
convict
regardless
of
the
evid
now
that
would
trueli
be
a
sad
day
for
civil
right
i
dont
know
about
everybodi
els
but
to
me
they
should
have
been
convict
becaus
of
the
evid
which
in
my
mind
wa
quit
suffici
so
you
sat
in
the
court
room
and
listen
to
the
case
after
care
consider
you
have
come
to
your
conclus
well
good
for
you
