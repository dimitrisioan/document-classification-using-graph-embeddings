even
when

is
in
my
opinion
total
wrong
ye
i

the

if
it
walk

had
everi
right
in

to

whatev

they

there
isnt
or
at

shouldnt
be
ani
law
that
say
that
you
have
to
be
a
nice
guy
in
your
privat
busi
deal
you
go
on
to
say
the
plant
would
never
have
been
shut
down
the
plaintiff
lawyer
would
have
just
negoti
a
windfal

becaus
the

the

le
than
the
valu
of
the
plant
to
have
the

continu
in
oper
if
so
so
what
sinc
when
are
the
court
suppos
to
be
in
the
busi
of
prevent
parti
from
reap
windfal
settlement
from
other
parti
when
those
settlement
aris
from
wrong
act
by
those
other
parti
if
atlant
cement
didnt
want
to
have
to
face
a
choic
between
pay
a
windfal
settlement
or
go
out
of
busi
well
shouldnt
atlant
cement
have
thought
of
that
befor
go
into
busi
i
note
that
a
far
a
the
fact
show
boomer
et
al
were
not
the
parti
respons
for
bring
about
thi
situat
that
wa
atlant
cement
own
fault
for
choos
to
build
and
oper
the
type
of
plant
they
did
where
and
when
they
did
and
then
you
say
everyon
properti
right
were
protect
the
plaintiff
were
made
whole
unnecessari
settlement
cost
were
avoid
a
abov
i
disput
your
claim
that
the
plaintiff
were
made
whole
they
were
in
fact
by
court
action
depriv
of
their
right
a
owner
of
properti
to
choos
to
sell
or
not
sell
that
properti
at
a
price
accept
to
them
and
for
that
depriv
they
were
not
made
whole
and
again
i
ask
sinc
when
are
the
court
suppos
to
be
in
the
busi
of
ensur
that
unnecessari
settlement
cost
are
avoid
if
so
ive
been
miseduc
i
alway
thought
that
the
court
were
suppos
to
be
in
the
busi
of
ensur
that
justic
is
done
is
boomer
realli
be
taught
a
infam
that
realli
sad
if
it
is
becaus
i
fail
to
see
how
it
le

complet

you
should
read

firsthand
instead

who
clearli
dont

that
my

if

it
goe
ive
admit

my
understand

gener
refer

is
weak
if

is
evenli
balanc
fine

a

by

it
is
not
