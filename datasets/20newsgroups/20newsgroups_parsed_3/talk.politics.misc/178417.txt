we
cant

what
phill
realli
mean
becaus
he
obvious
use
argument
design
to
convinc
i
make
no
secret
of
what
i
am
up
to
i
have
state
explicitli
in
post
that
i
am
a
polit
propagandist
on
numer
occas
anyon
post
to
thi
group
who
is
not
probabl
ha
the
wrong
group
for
exampl
i
have
on
numer
occas
state
quit
clearli
that
i
beleiv
that
certain
faction
of
the
gun
lobbi
are
the
worst
possibl
advoc
of
their
caus
and
i
am
prepar
to
do
anyth
in
my
power
to
provid
them
with
a
platform
becaus
they
can
convinc
peopl
far
better
than
i
could
hope
that
mani
peopl
with
a
fixat
on
lethal
weapon
are
danger
and
derrang
if
you
happen
to
know
a
polit
posit
which
doe
not
have
peopl
advoc
it
who
do
more
harm
than
good
pleas
point
it
out
some
peopl
have
even
accus
me
of
invent
such
advoc
pure
for
the
purpos
of
have
them
trash
a
set
of
polit
view
in
fact
thi
would
be
a
futil
tactic
becaus
i
could
never
hope
to
invent
a
charact
a
danger
a
sybokathenaedu
a
man
who
i
quit
serious
believ
to
be
mentali
ill
and
a
potenti
psychopath
unfortun
the
local
sherif
offic
have
inform
me
that
they
are
unabl
to
act
until
he
attack
someon
one
of
the
advantag
and
drawback
of
requir
proof
on
the
part
of
the
govern
befor
they
may
take
action
against
citizen
and
part
of
the
reason
some
of
u
believ
weapon
should
be
avail
so
if
you
were
to
ask
me
what
is
the
point
that
i
am
tri
to
make
from
thi
current
argument
on
the
absolut
sanctiti
of
the
u
constitut
what
would
i
answer
we
are
not
argu
the
absolut
sanctiti
of
the
u
constitut
in
fact
the
fillibust
were
talk
about
isnt
in
the
constitut
i
object
to
your
suggest
that
the
senat
wasnt
intend
to
exercis
the
power
it
wa
clearli
given
firstli
i
see
that
the
current
u
polit
scene
like
the
uk
polit
scene
ha
becom
tie
to
special
interest
rather
than
chase
the
conveni
caricatur
put
about
by
the
medium
and
polititian
themselv
for
thi
gay
right
cmapaign
environmentalist
zionist
ie
jew
foreign
lobbyist
whatev
vote
power
they
have
etc
i
sugest
that
you
look
at
who
is
realli
benefit
the
inevit
conclus
is
that
it
is
the
major
corpor
own
by
the
ultrawealthi
that
have
benefit
regan
and
bush
creat
what
can
onli
be
describ
a
a
welfar
state
for
the
rich
ill
point
out
again
that
reagan
onli
had
a
republican
major
in
the
senat
dure
hi
first
term
and
hi
coalit
in
the
hous
came
apart
at
about
the
same
time
bush
never
had
ani
real
support
in
congress
the
real
point
is
that
everybodi
everywher
got
their
pork
from
the
big
corpor
to
the
guy
i
saw
last
night

secondli
the

role
we

veri
littl
posit
about

can
not

the

the

wa
design
to

so
that
the

sure
they
were
get
what
they
want
by

i
see
put
the
brake
on

an
inher
bad
thing
califronia
ride
the

and
everi
time
they

it
get
wors
if
the

spend
by

they
will
have
it
sometim
or
perhap
most
of
the

the

point

prevent
thi

trickeri
onli

phill
would
you
do
me
the
veri
great
favor
of
repeat
that
in

method
will
alway
be
found
to
bypass
such
provis
and
onc
the

get
use
to
bypass
those
provis
they
will
bypass
the
other
up
to
the
first
ammend
cute
we
can
elimin
violat
of
the

by
elimin
the

thi
is
a
major
reason
whi
the
right
to
own
gun
should
be
exclud
the
implic
that
thi
right
is
equal
to
the
right
to
free

is
danger
free

alon
is
danger
phill
peopl
know
that
mass
ownership
of
lethal
weapon
caus
thousand
of
murder
a

the
danger
conclus
they
may
reach
is
that
the
first

may
also
be
the
same
danger
mistak
ok
phill
all
you
got
ta
show
me
is
a
clear
pattern
of
reduct
in
homicid
rate
across
sever
countri
and
thatll
be
it
not
current
mind
you
reduct
note
howev
that
thi
is
not
the
slipperi
slope
argument
it
is
becaus
the
right
freedom
of
speech
ha
been
chain
to
the
privileg
to
own
weaponri
that
the
danger
aris
the
advoc
of
thi
pivileg
must
not
be
allow
to
chain
freedom
of
speech
to
their
caus
such
that
if
they
fall
freedom
of

fall
a
well
such
action
are
not
the
action
of
peopl
genuin

who
chain

the

ive
tri
to

whi
it
isnt

the
onli
time
ive
refer

is
to
point
out
it
doesnt

you
appear

believ
were

just
didnt

the

you
