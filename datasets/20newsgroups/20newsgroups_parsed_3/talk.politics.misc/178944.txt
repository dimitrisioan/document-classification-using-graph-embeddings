avoid

it
strike

excel
put
even
a
a

i
like
there
is
a

complex
in

that
wa
partial
built
with

dollar
i
dont
know
how
much
wa
privat
and
how
much
wa
stolen
i
mean
public
but
it
is
beauti
and
i
enjoy
it
keep
in
mind
though
most
of
the
peopl
in
the
citi
will
never
attend
a
singl
perform
there
so
they
might
feel
differ
about
have

howev
i
have
to
disagre

it
be
desir

on

in
fact
we
have
a
lot
better
luck
maintain
our
freedom
of

precis
becaus
it
is
not

just
a
it

we
should

on

there
is
hope
that
a

be
restrict
from

but
there
is
no
hope
in
my
opinion
of
have
a
govern

interfer

in
an

i
call
