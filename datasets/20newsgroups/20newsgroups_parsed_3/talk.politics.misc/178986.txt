write
motorvot
stuff
my
friend
after
the
elect
brought
up
the
point
that
it
would
enabl
more
peopl
to
vote
howev
sinc
it
make
it
easier
to
get
to
the
place
of
registr
he
brought
up
the
analog
that
if
there
were
onli
one
place
to
vote
say
in
alaska
would
it
be
excess
and
wast
to
petit
to
have
more
place
to
vote
thi
is
a
similar
idea
a
way
to
encourag
more
peopl
to
vote
by
make
it
more
easili
access
i
not
know
where
i
stood
play
devil
advoc
and
said
well
would
you
have
the
taxpay
money
go
to
buse
for
those
peopl
that
have
troubl
make
it
to
dmv
then
where
doe
the
right
to
vote
merg
with
the
right
to
vote
easili
where
should
we
draw
the
line
well
there
doe
have
to
be
a
line
and
to
be
honest
extend
voter
registr
to
dmv
is
hardli
analog
to
have
onli
one
place
for
registr
in
alaska
and
open
a
new
one
in
atlanta
more
is
not
alway
better
onc
youv
pas
a
certain
point
my
friend
said
that
that
is
obvious
an
extrem
and
that
actual
the
motorvot
bill
would
save
money
becaus
no
longer
would
the
citi
have
to
pay
someon
to
sit
in
the
town
hall
and
spend
all
hisher
time
file
those
thing
theyd
just
be
at
the
push
of
a
button
or
the
fill
out
of
an
x
at
dmv
so
i
actual
someon
el
but
there
no
need
to
confus
thi
anymor
counter
again
say
that
wouldnt
congress
a
alway
get
exorbit
budget
and
fund
committe
to
orchestr
and
overse
the
implement
the
argument
went
back
and
forth
forev
rang
from
whether
or
not
it
better
to
have
more
peopl
vote
whether
that
is
even
relev
etc
just
look
for
some
more
opinion
anybodi
got
em
i
thought
the
motor
voter
bill
pas
in
ani
case
my
experi
with
tennesse
voter
registr
system
which
you
can
regist
with
by
mail
by
the
way
is
that
nobodi
who
is
interest
in
vote
is
be
deni
access
to
registr
all
it
requir
is
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
interest
on
the
registr
part
and
think
about
the
elect
onc
in
the
eleven
month
prior
to
it
onc
you
regist
it
good
unless
you
miss
for
year
worth
of
elect
of
move
it
easi
to
regist
now
i
simpli
dont
see
the
valu
in
go
out
and
tri
to
get
peopl
regist
who
dont
have
enough
gumption
to
even
write
and
have
the
proper
form
sent
