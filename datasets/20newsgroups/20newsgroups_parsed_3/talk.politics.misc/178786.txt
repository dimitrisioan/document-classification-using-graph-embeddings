i
heard
about
a
guy
in
alberta
who
came
down
with
some
rare
eye
diseas
that
he
had
to
take
repeat
trip
to
seattl
to
get
treat
well
what
american
privat
insur
plan
cover
travel
expens
well
it
wasnt
just
the
travel
expens
it
wa
the
whole
treatment
when
you
buy
insur
where
you
live
it
is
base
on
the
local
rate
tourist
come
from
say
utah
will
find
that
there
is
a
differ
in
what
their
insur
will
cover
fob
provo
and
what
they
get
stuck
with
at
lenox
hill
or
mount
sinai
if
they
fall
ill
in
the
big
appl
but
to
what
extent
doe
it
affect
the
system
and
whi
is
an
urgent
care
list
necessari
in
the
first
place
it
worth
think
about
it
regular
practic
in
a
hospit
to
figur
out
who
need
to
get
at
what
facil
dont
american
have
to
arrang
in
advanc
for
oper
too
i
think
that
there
are
two
standard
be
appli
here
and
that
canada
cant
give
beverli
hillsstyl
treatment
to
everybodi
it
not
a
big
brother
list
it
more
like
call
around
town
for
a
tabl
for
dinner
but
american
need
far
le
advanc
time
to
book
oper
it
would
depend
on
where
you
live
downtown
toronto
or
mile
british
columbia
just
like
cheyenn
wy
v
boston
ma
again
geographi
rear
it
ugli
head
sinc
our
health
care
provid
are
privat
they
depend
on
an
adequ
market
size
in
order
to
sustain
enough
busi
sinc
our
health
care
profession
have
equival
takehom
pay
to
their
american
cousin
it
not
that
theyr
be
paid
too
littl
to
provid
servic
whether
canadian
would
be
thrill
at
the
prospect
of
their
own
health
servic
cater
toward
american
who
would
be
will
to
pay
more
than
they
do
is
anoth
issu
entir
it
must
be
note
that
they
said
they
were
do
it
partli
becaus
their
grant
from
the
provinc
were
get
smaller
if
those
grant
are
so
insubstanti
whi
the
need
to
attract
foreign
to
make
up
the
differ
you
answer
the
question
yourself
privat

foundat
have
to
make
money
somehow
and
i
think
that
it
about
time
that
they
act
like
the
privat
hospit
that
they
are
person
im
fed
up
with
canadian
socialist
tri
to
tell
everyon
that
their
health
care
is
free
when
we
are
actual
buy

that
one
at
you
bob
rae
true
but
i
wa
thinkingdoescan
anybodi
compet
with

i
rememb
read
that
that
sort
of
privat
health

is
actual
illeg
in
canada
i
have
onli
hear
american
say
that
it
illeg
but
i
could
be

just
have
never
heard
it

i
guess
that
you
can
argu
that
there
is
a
right

so

i
take

one

it

and

there
wa
a

from
the
director

at

hospit
in

respond
to
an
articl
on
a
studi
compar
heart
surgeri
in
california
and
canada
in
which
some
canadian
doctor
worri
that
american
analyst
would
seiz
on
the
result
a
proof
that
canada
ration
vital
servic
the
doctor
i
cant
recal
hi
name
said
that
canada
is
ration
vital
servic
a
ani
physician
can
plainli
see
he
said
that
a
system
in
which
peopl
are
refus
treatment
becaus
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
differ
from
a
system
in
which
peopl
are
refus
treatment
becaus
the
govern
cant
afford
it
a
a
result
of
deliber
underfund
of
the
health
insur
plan
in
fair
he
did
say
that
both
the
u
and
canadian
system
are
in
the
same
situat
the
onli
way
to
hit
at
the
canadian
system
is
transient
period
of
high
demand
which
is
more
a
function
of
the
doctor
monopoli
tight
fist
on
the
licenc
an
obviou
differ
is
that
in
such
a
transient
period
the
ration
is
of
the
natur
of
a
mob
battl
over
cabbag
patch
dollstm
a
weve
seen
recent
a
oppos
by
ration
by
abil
to
pay
but
the
former
is
a
transient
situat
and
if
a
larg
bodi
of
insur
patient
were
to
delug
the
california
health
infrastructur
the
same
would
result
ration
among
the
insur
popul
with
smaller
market
there
is
much
le
flexibl
when
deal
with
our
insur
popul
than
california
which
by
the
way
ha
rd
more
peopl
than
canada
in
a
much
more
dens
area
so
he
is
correct
in
that
the
resourc
are
fix
for
a
particular
time
window
or
a
a
function
of
the
doctor
monopoli
licenc
accord
to
the
market
steadi
state
in
either
case
a
for
be
refus
treatment
the
govern
of
the
day
would
be
shred
to
tatter
if
someth
like
that
were
to
happen
canadian
can
be
geograph
bad
too
not
realiz
that
their
health
care
is
privat
while
onli
their
insur
isnt
too
mani
peopl
have
bought
into
socialist
trype
that
we
have
social
medicin
i
know
i
know
the
monopoli
power
of
canadian
doctor
often
lead
them
to
overst
the
problem
with
the
system
in
order
to
get
more
money
from
the
govern
anoth
case
of
businessmen
onc
scratch
becom
socialist
right
a
ive
point
out
abov
but
hasnt
that
just
shift
the
locu
of
the
problem
from
one
place
to
the
other
it
hasnt
realli
solv
it
either
way
the
transient
situat
are
hard
to
deal
with
sinc
the
chang
in
the
privat
medic
care
resourc
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
abil
of
peopl
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disast
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
diseas
a
doctor
need
year
of
train
plu
internship
and
specialti
train
peopl
too
often
tend
to
put
prescript
cold
medicin
on
their

when
they
realli
dont
need
to
that
whi
ive
argu
for

rather
than

which
is
what
most
canadian
fiscal
conserv
are
argu
for
the
leftist
ah
just
let
em
spend
yeah
right
also
note
that
onli
a
few
provinc
cover
prescript
under
some
high
dollar
threshold
in
most
it
your
privat

that
cover
it
just

still
it
all

the

mitterand
did
ha
anybodi
consid
follow
singapor
exampl
and
go
to
a
system
where
the
compani
and
the
state
buy
basic
and
catastroph
coverag
for
everybodi
and
then
you
also
have
an
ira
sort
of
thing
to
which
you
and
your

can
can
contribut
for
medic
expens
onli
it
would
tend
to
discourag
you
from

it
the

ira
would
have
limit
use
a
youd
need
a
lower
catastroph
threshold
els
there
still
be
a
drain
on
the
public
purs
if
someon
exhaust
their
ira
also
singapor
ha
a
much
more
autocrat
mental
which
ha
seap
down
into

if
singaporean
that
ive
met
are
ani
indic
i
dont
mean
ani
disprespect
here
where
theyd
let
you
just
die
one
of
the
good
thing
about
be
the
last
countri
to
creat
a
nation
health
care
system
should
we
decid
to
is
that
we
have
everybodi
el
mistak
to
learn
from
that
true
the
question
is
how
much
leeway
is
there
between
the
u
approach
and
the
secondmost
capitalist
approach
of
canada
franc
and
germani
serious
there
are
few
area
that
have
suffici
popul
for
a
twomoreti
system
like
what
the
french
have
a
health
polici
prof
dg
shea
ha
cite
studi
in
the
nejm
that
indic
have
a
popul
of
is
necessari
for
adequ

and
in
canada
there
are
onli
four
citi
west
of
the
great

with
that
popul

larger
but
there
are
mani
citi
in
the

with
that
kind
of
popul
ye
mani
and
pretti
close
to
a
lot
of
smaller
town
or
not
too
far
from
a
bigger
town
just
take
a
look
at
a
detail
atla
or
better
take
a
flight
from
pittsburgh
or
rochest
to
toronto
my
first
time
across
lake
ontario
to
nyc
i
wa
amaz
by
the
increas
in
densiti
and
the
toronto
region
is
the
densest
in
all
of
canada
there
wa
one
about
a
group
of
doctor
in
calgari
who
have
open
canada
first
usstyl
mri
clinic
a
an
altern
to
the
provinci
own
one
it
about
time
ive
rag
on
my
own
doctor
friend
a
to
whi
they
dont
invest
in
their
own
privat
practic
in
the
end
it
their
money
but
they
choos
to
spend
it
on
america
cup
pipedream
and
that
none
of
my
busi
a
for
provinci
own
for
sure
it
against
the
law
in
canada
for
govern
to
be
directli
involv
in
the
provis
of
health
care
except
in
the
militari
or
nativ
reser
vation
what
that
term
actual
mean
is
that
the
facil
get
by
on
public
grant
to
meet
shortfal
from
lack
of
use
no
kid
medic
practic
itself
is
much
more
conserv
up
north
my
own
best
friend
did
two
clerkship
at
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochest
mn
and
is
no
stranger
to
high
tech
medicin
but
hi
boat
come
first
there
were
some
peopl
express
concern
that
it
wa
the
first
wedg
of
twotier
health
care
and
that
it
might
violat
the
canada
health
act
no
it
probabl
socialist
whiner
who
are
offend
that
we
have
privat
practic
and
alway
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyway
so
whi
not
have
a
particular
facil
the
canadian
big
govern
mental
often
imago
govern
where
it
doe
not
even
exist
sinc
the
french
and
german
have
becom
more
entrepreneuri
and
le
laidback
without
sacrif
their
cultur
and
valu
then
canadian
can
do
the
same
a
ive
point
out
abov
the
law
state
that
it
is
illeg
for
the
govern
to
provid
ani
health
servic
except
for
the
militari
and
nativ
look
nobodi
stop
the
clinic
when
they
plan
on
the
mri
nobodi
stop
them
when
they
bought
it
nobodi
seem
to
be
stop
them
from
use
it
either
much
ado
about
noth
thank
good
that
hockey
playoff
have
start
while
it
seem
current
unjustifi
there
wa
one
anecdot
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstr
the
mri
he
show
an
imag
of
an
injur
knee
which
happen
to
belong
to
the
manag
of
the
bank
who
approv
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provinci
mri
then
anoth
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscl
would
have
atrophi
and
rehabilit
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tier
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exagger
somewher
becaus
the
gao
studi
of

cite
often
on

did
not
find
access
to

ill
bet
the

reli
