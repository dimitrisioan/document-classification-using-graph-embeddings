well
ye
and
no
the
federalist
paper
are
propaganda
and
it
is
therefor
difficult
to
determin
precis
what
maddison
etc
were
up
to
from
them
there
are
a
coupl
of
way
to
look
at
them
one
is
we
want
you
to
support
thi
constitut
so
well
say
anyth
that
we
think
will
appeal
to
you
or
the
more
straightforward
thi
is
whi
we
think
what
weve
suggest
in
thi
constitut
is
a
good
idea
you
clearli
consid
the
former
to
be
the
primari
situat
the
point
is
that
they
did
not
make
pain
to
point
out
where
the
consitut
may
have
been
aginst
the
new
yorker
interest
also
they
did
not
want
to
rais
opposit
by
base
their
advocaci
on
unpopular
principl
horror
appeal
to
popular
principl
can
we
perhap
a
the
question
of
whether
the
constitut
might
have
been
written
to
appeal
to
the
principl
rather
than
a
you
appear
to
believ
it
wa
written
with
someth
el
in
mind
and
propoganda
put
out
by
it
support
but
let
be
honest
about
someth
here
when
wa
the
last
time
you
brought
up
all
the
valid
point
against
your
own
argument
or
are
they
simpli
propogranda
we
cant
know
what
phill
realli
mean
becaus
he
obvious
use
argument
design
to
convinc
well
i
know
hamilton
wa
a
dy
in
the
wool
monarchist
and
probabl
the
authoritarian
extrem
to
jefferson
democrat
impul
but
what
would
you
suggest
a
a
mean
of
determin
their
opinion
on
the
govern
if
we
dont
consid
what
they
wrote
about
the
govern
i
dont
propos
that
ani
mean
exist
for
determin
their
true
opinion
thu
their
true
opinion
die
with
them
and
are
of
littl
help
today
their
opinion
have
not
the
slightest
bear
on
the
matter
though
onli
their
argument
these
are
true
or
fals
regardless
of
who
said
them
or
whi
if
theyr
true
or
fals
regardl
of
whi
they
were
said
whi
on
earth
did
you
make
a
point
of
call
them
propogranda
that
would
seem
to
be
irrelev
the
difficulti
that
most
u
poster
seem
to
have
is
in
consid
that
their
argument
may
have
been
flaw
or
no
longer
appli
to
modern
societi
oh
i
have
no
argument
with
question
them
i
dont
believ
they
no
longer
appli
but
that
becaus
i
think
most
of
them
were
good
argument
im
not
entir
happi
about
the
situat
becaus
they
were
obvious
onli
appli
to
a
minor
of
the
time
but
i
dont
think
that
alon
is
suffici
to
invalid
them
if
they
were
aliv
today
the
one
opinion
we
could
count
upon
these
men
to
express
is
that
a
care
studi
of
the
mechan
of
govern
is
necessari
and
that
an
ongo
improv
of
the
same
is
requir
they
gave
their
opinion
in
certain
area
and
have
been
prove
right
in
other
area
they
got
it
wrong
they
ensur
that
there
wa
a
mechan
to
adapt
and
improv
the
consititut
thi
can
onli
happen
if
there
is
a
willing
to
accept
that
the
structur
problem
within
the
u
polit
system
may
requir
constitut
chang
a
a
solut
sinc
the
u
constitut
is
the
basi
for
the
u
polit
system
most
chang
in
it
would
requir
constitut
chang
in
thi
particular
case
howev
the
fillibust
is
a
matter
of
procedur
and
tradit
it
onli
should
have
been
made
part
of
the
constitut
if
the
senat
wa
le
power
than
the
hous
of
lord
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
hous
of
repres
wa
also
in
fact
they
both
were
becaus
the
british
govern
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
in
principl
no
in
practic
ye
in
principl
no
that
they
had
le
power
of
that
they
should
have
had
le
power
the
british
govern
today
is
theoreticali
depend
on
the
will
of
the
monarch
by
convent
ani
monarch
seek
to
exercis
that
power
is
depos
the
subtli
is
that
the
prime
minist
is
not
abl
to
identifi
their
polit
with
the
nation
interest
in
the
same
manner
that
u
presid
regularli
do
phill
were
discus
the
power
of
legisl
hous
while
the
prime
minist
is
member
of
parliament
he
is
more
analg
although
badli
to
the
u
presid
now
plea
explain
to
me
how
the
u
hous
of
repres
is
in
principl
more
power
than
the
hous
of
lord
or
the
senat
but
in
practic
is
le
are
you
suggest
that
the
writer
of
the
constitut
realli
intend
for
them
to
be
more
power
but
gosh
darn
the
thing
wa
ratifi
befor
they
realiz
theyd
forgotten
to
put
those
extra
restrict
on
the
senat
in
i
disagre
the
system
is
not
too
slow
it
wa
simpli
design
to
handl
le
than
it
ha
demand
that
it
handl
a
somebodi
in
washington
put
it
whose
name
i
forget
congress
ha
becom
everybodi

one
reason
for
that
is
that
at
everi
level
the

is
render
unabl
to
come

these

are
push

it
is

all

the

most
other
question
local

ha
not
fail
in
that
it
hasnt
done
what

that
it
is

nonloc

who
want

cant

thu
sinc
theyv
got
more

onli
in

they
appeal
to
the

becaus
it
can
impos
it

i

let
get
real
here
do
we
realli
need
the
congr

state
decid
that
x
traffic
light

such

or
that
carjack
need

the
more
peopl
want
the
more
congress
will
take
power
to
sell
it
to
them
for
their

i
dont
think
the
rise
of
special
interest
is
coincid
with
the
increas
power
of
congress
congress
is
more
than
capabl
of
quick
action
and
ha
more
than
enough
power
and
time
on
it
hand
if
it
confin
itself
to
what
it
origin
jurisidict
wa
and
allow
more
local
autonomi
if
they
were
to
start
from
a
social
welfar
model
instead
of
the
current
no
state
subsidi
motto
they
would
be
better
place
a
it
is
there
is
plenti
of
state
money
be
hand
out
the
problem
is
that
it
is
distribut
on
the
basi
of
power
in
congress
and
not
on
the
basi
of
actual
need
bingo
the
higher
up
the
government
ladder
the
le
actual
need
matter
becaus
polit
power
can
be
concentr
at
higher
level
while
peopl
with
le
cloud
onli
find
themselv
reduc
to
in

in
order
to
set
up
a
school
project
in

state
you
have
to
pay

the
other
state
with
pork
defens
contract
agricultur
subsidi
etc
or
to
be
precis
of
the

sinc
you
need
to
beat
the
filibust
then
whi
not
simpli
leav
new
york
educ
to
new

i
remain
unconcinv
that
there
is
ani
state
in
the
union
which
is
not
capabl
of
educ
it
own
child
if
that
what
they
want
to
do
and
if
you
leav
it
to
them
you
onli
have
to
worri
about
the
pork
in
that
state
and
sinc
industri
cant
concentr
their
polit
power
and

rather
they
must
divid
it
among
the
state
to
tri
and
get
what
they
want
individu
voic
have
more
rel
impact
the
problem
with
the
fillibust
is
not
that
you
must
buy
off
state
but
that
the
congress
ha
acquir
too
much
power
to
sell
pork
it
is
not
a
case
of
the
system
of
govern
they
creat
fail
but
that
it
is
oper
under
a
set
of
condit
they
specif
want
to
avoid
name
a
concentr
of

it
would
seem
then
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
not
to
reduc
the
power
of
either
hous
in
some
attempt
to
greas
the

all
youll
get
then
is
a

which

it

no
you

befor
you
can
redirect

but
whi
on

should
we
want

you
said
yourself
that
you
have
to
sell

the
differ

is
that

they

also
believ

most

i

is
fine

of
the
problem
in

which
almost
necessit
it

there
is
no

have
use

i
am
realli
curiou
how
you
singl

out
a
the

he
ha
the
record
for

bush
phill
that
absurd
bush
had

one
of
which
wa

go
read
up
on
fdr
if
you
think
that
anyth
resembl
a
record
whi
is
it
not
a
reason
restrict
becaus
senat
is
the
magic
holi
number
upon
which
law
must
be
base
if
senat
feel
safe
enough
with
their
state
constitu
to
stand
up
and
fillibust
isnt
that
enough
to
indic
there
a
suffici
question
a
to
whether
a
law
is
a
good
idea
or
not
to
reevalu
it
up
to
a
point
the
fact
is
though
that
when
the
major
are
oppos
by
a
minor
the
minor
should
not
be
allow
to
win
by
default
whi
not
what
is
inher
wrong
with
bias
the
system
against

histor
governemnt
action
in
the
u
when
deal

with
a

and
a

have
not
been
success
when
your
in

peopl
whi
should
the
feder
govern
not

through

whi
one
earth
should
be
suffici
to
enact
a

which
cover
million
peopl
in
veri
veri
diver
place
and
live
in
radic
differ
condit
whi
shouldnt
a
supermajor
be
requir
becaus
the

at

is
a
money
bill
relat
to
a
short

propos
now
were
switch
from
a
gener
question
of
a
fillibust
to
a
specif

i
dont
see
how
it
make
a
differ
it
is
not
a
chang
in
the
law
where
a
presupposit
in

of
the
statu

is
arguabl
sure
it
arguabl
theyr
argu
it
howev
requir
to

ensur
that
theyll
have
to
have
a

someth
that
isnt
base
sole
on
parti
line
ani
system
in
which
the
simpl
major
is
given
absolut
power
to
ignor
the
minor
then
the
minor
will
be
ignor
i
do
not
see
thi
a
a
posit
thing
and
for
all
that
im
sure
the
republican
are
look
for
pork
a
much
a
the
democrat
theyv
got
some
legitim
object
to
the
legisl
in
question
so
instead
you
consid
a
system
under
which
the
minor
automat
win
to
be
superior
no
i
am
complet
happi
with
a
system
which
requir
a
minor
for

sinc
u
histori
is
a
histori
of
carv
up

group
and
implement

on

i
feel
minor
should
have
suffic

to
prevent
action
they
feel
strongli
enough
about
and
is
hardli
a
tini
minor
i
dont
advoc
the

be
capabl
of

but
i
see
no
