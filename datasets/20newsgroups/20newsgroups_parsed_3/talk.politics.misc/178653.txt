where
did
john
f
mcmanu
get

idea
anyway
let
say
your
a
canadian
live
in
a
small
town
near
the
usa
border
your
child
need
a
complic
procedur
onli
avail
in
citi
hospit
the
nearest
canadian
citi
are
hour
west

hour
east
and
there
an
american
citi
one
hour
south
which
way
are
you
go
to
go
is
it
becaus
the
american

the
best
in

amaz
me
that

reform
there
are
a
million
differ
