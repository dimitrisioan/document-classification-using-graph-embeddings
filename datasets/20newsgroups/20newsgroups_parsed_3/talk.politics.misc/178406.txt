present
to
congress
which
would
creat
hundr
of
thousand
of
job
most
of
them
in
the
privat
sector
in
and
pass
the
hous
of
repres
it
now
ha
the
support
of
a
major
of
the
unit
state
senat
but
it
been
held
up
by
a
filibust
of
a
minor
in
the
senat
just
senat
they
block
a
vote
that
they
know
would
result
in
the
passag
of
our
bill
and
the
creation
of
job
the
issu
isnt
polit
the
issu
is
peopl
million
of
american
are
wait
for
thi
legisl
and
count
on
it
count
on
u
in
washington
but
the
job
bill
ha
been
ground
by
gridlock
i
know
the
american
peopl
are
tire
of
busi
a
usual
and
polit
a
usual
i
know
they
dont
want
u
to
spin
or
wheel
they
want
the
recoveri
to
get
move
so
i
have
taken
a
first
step
to
break
thi
gridlock
and
gone
the
extra
mile
yesterday
i
offer
to
cut
the
size
of
thi
plan
by
percent
from
billion
to
billion
it
not
what
id
hope
for
with
million
american
look
for
fulltim
work
i
simpli
cant
let
the
bill
languish
when
i
know
that
even
a
compromis
bill
will
mean
hundr
of
thousand
of
job
for
our
peopl
the
mandat
is
to
act
to
achiev
chang
and
move
the
countri
forward
by
take
thi
initi
in
the
face
of
an
unrel
senat
talkathon
i
think
we
can
respond
to
your
mandat
and
achiev
a
signific
portion
of
our
origin
goal
first
we
want
to
keep
the
program
a
much
a
possibl
that
are
need
to
gener
job
and
meet
human
need
includ
highway
and
road
construct
summer
job
for
young
peopl
immun
for
child
construct
of
wast
water
site
and
aid
to
small
busi
we
also
want
to
keep
fund
for
extend
unemploy
compens
benefit
for
peopl
who
have
been
unemploy
for
a
long
time
becaus
the
economi
isnt
creat
job
second
ive
recommend
that
all
the
other
program
in
the
bill
be
cut
acrosstheboard
by
a
littl
more
than
percent
and
third
ive
recommend
a
new
element
in
thi
program
to
help
u
immedi
start
our
attempt
to
fight
against
crime
by
provid
million
for
citi
and
town
to
rehir
polic
offic
who
lost
their
job
dure
the
recess
and
put
them
back
to
work
protect
our
peopl
im
also
go
to
fight
for
a
tough
crime
bill
becaus
the
peopl
of
thi
countri
need
it
and
deserv
it
now
the
peopl
who
are
filibust
thi
bill
the
republican
senat
say
they
wont
vote
for
it
becaus
it
increas
deficit
spend
becaus
there
extra
spend
thi
year
that
hasnt
alreadi
been
approv
that
sound
reason
doesnt
it
here
what
they
dont
say
thi
program
is
more
than
paid
for
by
budget
cut
over
my
fiveyear
budget
and
thi
budget
is
well
within
the
spend
limit
alreadi
approv
by
the
congress
thi
year
it
amaz
to
me
that
mani
of
these
same
senat
who
are
filibust
the
bill
vote
dure
the
previou
administr
for
billion
of
dollar
of
the
same
kind
of
emerg
spend
and
much
of
it
wa
not
design
to
put
the
american
peopl
to
work
thi
is
not
about
deficit
spend
we
have
offer
a
plan
to
cut
the
deficit
thi
is
about
where
your
prioriti
are
on
peopl
or
on
polit

in
mind
that
our
job
bill
is
paid
for
dollar
