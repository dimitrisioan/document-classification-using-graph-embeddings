is

the
desir
of
those
run
establish
busi
to
prevent
or
restrict
the
entri
of
competitor
is
an
understand
though
gener
unpleas
human
fail
but
without
a
mean
to
act
on
thi
desir
without
a
govern
with
suffici
power
to
restrict
the
option
of
the
potenti
competitor
the
anticompetit
desir
remain
just
an
unpleas
wish
the
govern
is
the
linchpin
so
we
seek
to
disengag
it
so
we
dont
get

mark
you
dont

a
you
are

but
what
i
hear
from
libertarian
is
a
desir
to
limit
incumb
term
to
weaken
govern
by
elimin
it
power
to
enforc
antitrust
law
and
a
desir
to
elimin

me
a
a

way
to
insur
that
auto
dealer
and
other
special

can
not
influenc
public
polici
in
fact
they
seem
clearli
design
to
accomplish
the
opposit
thi
is
similar
to
my
say
that
clinton

summit
doe
littl
to

the
health
care
problem
look
at
the
whole
pictur
not
just
randomli
pick
libertarian
posit
if
govern
is
not
allow
to
use
noniniti
forc
to
achiev
it
goal
than
no
special
interest
can
influenc
the
govern
to
use
noniniti
forc
on
their
behalf
the
mean
to
reach
such
a
restrict
govern
is
anoth
topic
which
ill
address
briefli
it
certainli
wont
happen
until
libertarian
is
the

what
mean
do
we
have
to
