patrick

write
assum
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
branch
davidian
peopl
immol
themselv
in
the
manner
describ
by
the
feder
author
whi
doe
the
gener
consensu
appear
to
be
that
they
the
bd
were
insan
is
it
the
manner
of
their
behaviour
befor
they
die
or
the
fact
they
chose
to
kill
themselv
rather
than
submit
to
the
govern
i
ask
thi
question
becaus
there
is
a
tradit
and
one
that
is
highli
regard
by
mani
peopl
that
sever
hundr
jew
elect
to
throw
themselv
off
a
cliff
at
masada
rather
than
submit
to
roman
rule
the
circumst
at
masada
and
those
at
waco
would
seem
in
gener
term
quit
similar
and
yet
so
far
a
im
awar
nobodi
ha
serious
suggest
that
the
jew
were
insan
the
point
of
thi
comparison
is
to
question
the
use
of
the
word
cult
in
discuss
the
event
at
waco
whi
were
the
davidian
a
cult
and
not
the
jew
at
masada
what
constitut
a
cult
is
it
the
size
of
the
membership
or
a
matter
of
respect
or
perhap
the
length
of
time
it
been
in
exist
are
the
cathol
a
cult
how
about
the
mormon
or
the
calvinist
is
a
sect
a
respect
cult
dictionari
definit
asid
sinc
popular
usag
seem
to
carri
more
weight
i
suspect
that
the
word
cult
is
use
in
a
perjor
sens
when
speak
of
group
like
the
davidian
it
is
rather
like
the
word
bo
when
use
to
describ
someon
unpopular
or
someon
the
govern
wish
to
make
unpopular
like
say
castro
the
communist
bo
of
cuba
one
doesnt
hear
clinton
describ
a
america
democrat
or
capitalist
bo
well
for
one
thing
most
if
not
all
the
dividian
depend
on
whether
they
could
show
they
act
in
selfdefens
and
there
were
no
illeg
weapon
could
have
gone
on
with
their
life
a
they
were
live
it
no
one
wa
forc
them
to
give
up
their
religion
or
even
their
legal
weapon
the
dividian
had
surviv
a
chang
in
leadership
befor
so
even
if
koresch
himself
would
have
been
convict
and
sent
to
jail
they
still
could
have
carri
on
i
dont
think
the
dividian
were
insan
but
i
dont
see
a
reason
for
mass
suicid
if
the
fire
wa
intent
set
by
some
of
the
dividian
we
also
dont
know
that
if
the
fire
wa
intent
set
from
insid
wa
it
a
gener
know
plan
or
wa
thi
someth
onli
an
inner
circl
knew
about
or
wa
it
someth
two
or
three
felt
they
had
to
do
with
or
without
koresch
knowledgebless
etc
i
dont
know
much
about
masada
were
some
peopl
throw
other
over

mother
jump
over
with
their
babi
in
their
