by

i
just
wish
i
had
the
email
address
of
total
gumbi
who
wa
say
that
clinton
didnt
propos
a
nst
actual
jerri
brown
essenti
didand
clinton
in
hi
demagogu
persona
condemn
brown
for
it
in
the
crucial
ny
primari
last
year
howev
whi
dont
the
republican
get
their
act
togeth
and
say
they
will
support
a
broadbas
vat
that
would
have
to
be
visibl
the
vat
in
canada
is
visibl
unlik
the
invis
vat
they
have
in
europ
and
suggest
a
rate
suffici
to
halv
incom
and
corpor
and
capit
gain
tax
rate
and
at
a
rate
suffici
to
give
the
clinton
enough
revenu
for
their
health
care
reform
the
republican
are
in
gener
fight
ani
tax
increas
there
is
also
worri
that
a
vat
would
be
far
too
easi
to
increas
increment
btw
what
is
differ
between
canada
tax
and
most
of
europ
that
make
it
visibl
and
forc
an
agreement
with
the
democrat
that
the
top
incom
tax
rate
would
then
be
frozen
for
the
forseeabl
futur
and
could
be
increas
onli
via
a
nation
referendum
thi
would
requir
a
constitut
amend
and
congress
enjoy
rais
tax
too
much
to
restrict
themselv
like
that
besid
with
the
major
necessari
to
pull
that
off
youd
have
a
difficult
time
forc
anyth
like
that
whi
not
make
use
of
the
clinton
to
do
someth
worthwhil
shift
the
tax
burden
from
invest
to
consumpt
and
get
health
care
reform
and
a
frozen
low
top
margin
tax
rate
all
in
one
fell
swoop
primarili
becaus
it
a
practic
imposs
to
freez
tax
rate
howev
thi
is
someth
that
bother
me
were
alway
talk
about
consum
confid
and
consum
spend
a
gaug
for
the
economi
if
they
realli
are
import
wouldnt
shift
tax
to
consumpt
provid
a
disincent
