tobacco
and
firearm
batf
launch
a
fullscal
highprofil
assault
on
the
branch
davidian
compound
thi
raid
wa
much
more
than
an

wa
a
plan
medium
circu
use
a
a

and
just
purpos
at
the
onset
of
the
noknock
raid
gaggl
of
heavili
arm
batf
agent
made
their
way
insid
the
compound
without
identifi
themselv
or
state
that
they
had
a
warrant
until
long
after
the
shoot
began
silent
the
agent
made
their
way
to
the
compound
build
and
start
their
search
by
charg
at
the
build
and
throw
concuss
grenad
and
order
the
cult
member
to
come
out
of
the

if
unknown
person

attack
you
throw
grenad
and
brandish

would
you
not
assum
that
these

attempt
to
defend
yourself
the
