but
they
were
never
consid
not

isnt
the
fact
that

purchas
a
oppos
to

that
they
were
not
thought
a

didnt
the

curiou
if
there
wa
an
addit
level
of

made
by
the

to

if

live
in

whether

i
dont
know
but
it
seem
that
a
case
could
be
made
that
they
werent
treat

and
sinc
the

is
nomin
base
on
the
declar

state
that
all

are
creat
equal
that
they
are
endow
by

with
certain
unalien

that
among
these
are
life
liberti

it
would
also
seem

slave
would
not
follow

definit
