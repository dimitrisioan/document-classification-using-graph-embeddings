write
on

the
costbenefit
ratio
of
govern
regul
is
obvious
worthwhil
the
libertarian
agenda
howev
doe
not
call
for
thi
assess
it
assum
that
the
cost
of
regul
of
ani
kind
alway
outweigh
it
benefit
thi
approach
avoid
all
sort
of
difficult
analysi
but
it
strike
mani
of
the
rest
of
u
a
dogmat
to
say
the
least
i
assum
you
mean
that
analyz
the
costbenefit
ratio
of
govern
regul
on
a
case
by
case
basi
is
worthwhil
let
me
suggest
that
thi
is
not
an
option
regul
regul
it
what
they
do
im
not
sure
whi
you
dont
consid
it
an
option
no
one
suggest
that
such
analysi
should
be
left
to
regul
in
fact
the
reinvent
govern
movement
provid
just
such
a
costbenefit
approach
to
the
analysi
of
public
spend
libertarian
would
do
well
to
learn
more
about
it
it
might
be
possibl
to
pa
an
amend
which
would
prevent
ani
liscens
law
from
be
valid
assum
you
could
convinc
peopl
that
it
would
overal
be
a
good
idea
elimin
the
liscens
law
which
serv
no
good
purpos
the
vast
major
of
them
while
maintain
the
worthwhil
one
assum
there
are
ani
is
not
feasibl
sorri
but
it
strike
me
that
it
is
the
onli
feasibl
approach
what
is
not
feasibl
is
a
wholesal
attack
on
all
govern
regul
and
licens
that
treat
cut
hair
and
practic
medicin
a
equival
task
i
have
no
object
to
an
analysi
of
medic
care
educ
nation
defens
or
local
polic
that
suggest
a
free
market
can
provid
a
more
effect
effici
mean
of
accomplish
social
object
than
is
provid
through
statist
approach
with
some
notabl
except
howev
i
do
not
see
such
nittygritti
worthwhil
analysi
be
carri
out
by
selfprofess
libertarian
jsh
i
note
that
the
abov
exampl
tend
to
be
among
the
few
govern
area
like
to
win
some
approv
among
libertarian
anyway
actual
the
onli
area
of
public
spend
abov
that
strike
me
a
gener
substanti
support
among
libertarian
are
polic
and
defens
it
is
an
interest
asid
that
a
commit
a
libertarian
claim
to
be
to
a
principl
of
noncoercion
the
onli
area
of
public
spend
that
they
frequent
support
involv
hire
peopl
with
gunshmmm
the
most
objection
govern
expenditur
are
entitl
which
also
are
the
biggest
certain
individu
will
suggest
that
these
should
be
consid
defens
on
the
ground
that
they
are
a
sort
of
danegeld
to
wouldb
revolutionari
but
i
person
dont

we
have
much
to

from
an

perhap
you

suggest
that
you
consid

frequent

a

govern
that
ignor
such
