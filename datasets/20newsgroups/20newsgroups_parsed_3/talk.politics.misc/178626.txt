how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a
bunch
of
cop
put
their
life
on
the
line
day
in
and
day
out
who
are
afraid
a
hell
of
a
larg
black
guy
tha
t
took
a
larg
amount
of
punish
and
refus
submit
im
curiou
whi
you
think
that
particular
adject
is
import
black
is
a
descript
adject
that
describ
mr
king
from
mani
of
the
newspap
radio
and
tv
news
report
i
have
seen
thi
adject
is
commonli
in
front
of
hi
name
i
have
never
seen
anyon
complain
about
the
use
of
thi
adject
when
use
in
a
benign
manner
i
did
not
say
that
mr
king
wa
a
no
good
black
i
do
not
know
mr
king
and
would
not
make
thi
ascertian
without
some
evid
to
thi
effect
i
use
it
pure
a
a
descript
adject
in
the
same
manner
than
mani
most
news
peopl
have
use
it
in
the
past
no
one
is
question
whether
mr
king
is
black
the
question
aris
whether
king
race
should
make
polic
offic
afraid
a
hell
your
statement
seem
to
impli
that
cop
should
have
a
differ
standard
for
larg
black
guy
than
for
just
larg
guy
in
gener
the
origin
poster
never
said
they
were
afraid
of
king
becaus
he
wa
black
in
fact
the
offic
were
afraid
of
king
becaus
of
what
he
did
not
becaus
of
the
color
of
hi
skin
it
is
you
mr
frank
that
read
the
phrase
larg
black
man
and
cri
racism
in
a
typic
kneejerk
fashion
when
you
and
other
i
suspect
can
get
past
thi
problem
mayb
the
real
problem
in
thi
issu
can
be
discuss
that
two
post
later
you
dont
understand
whi
anyon
point
out
your
use
of
the
adject
is
almost
a
inform
