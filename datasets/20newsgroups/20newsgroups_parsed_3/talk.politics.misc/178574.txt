we
are
not
win
the

on

i
think
you
can
see
that
one
of
the
tactic
that
the
dea
employ
to
give
peopl
the
impress
that
the
war
on
drug
is
be
won
is
to
select
quot
statist
onli
statist
that
support
their
content
that
drug
use
ha
gone
down
the
excerpt
from
time
magazin
that
i
includ
in
thi
post
is
an
excel
exampl
of
how
organ
like
the
dea
attempt
to
deceiv
the
public
usag
of
one
particular
drug
may
have
gone
down
but
at
the
same
time
usag
of
other
drug
may
have
gone
up
aka
substitut
also
drug
usag
among
one
particular
age
group
may
have
gone
down
but
drug
usag
among
anoth
age
group
may
have
gone
up
therefor
if
one
take
a
look
at
the
big
pictur
take
into
consider
all
the
statist
then
it
obviou
that
the
socal
war
on
drug
is
be
lost
perhap
the
drug
war
is
be
won
a
far
a
illeg
drug
go
but
if
one
factor
in
alcohol
abus
smoke
and
use
of
inhal
then
the
magnitud
of
the
drug
problem
in
thi
countri
can
then
place
in
it
true
perspect
for
those
of
you
who
dont
consid
alcohol
to
be
a
drug
then
tri
drink
a
fifth
of
whiskey
sometim
and
then
come
back
and
tell
me
that
it
not
a
drug
agenc
like
the
dea
onli
go
after
illeg
drug
thi
is
one
of
the
reason
whi
the
drug
war
is
a
fruitless
attempt
at
prevent
substanc
abusepeopl
will
mere
switch
to
anoth
drug
if
the
one
they
were
use
becom
scarc
or
unpopular
the
solut
to
the
drug
abus
problem
in
thi
countri
may
be
to
legal
somenot
alldrug
whose
toxic
ha
been
shown
to
be
within
reason
limit
you
wont
drop
dead
after
use
it
a
few
time
and
then
coupl
thi
with
a
massiv
drug
educ
program
the
reason
whi
i
think
legal
is
part
of
the
solut
is
becaus
peopl
seem
to
be
abl
to
easili
obtain
drug
despit
the
govern
effort
to
the
contraryth
money
spent
on
drug
interdict
could
be
spent
more
effect
elsewher
eg
drug
educ
addit
legal
would
reduc
crime
becaus
the
profit
motiv
would
be
taken
out
of
drug
traffick
which
often
goe
along
with
other
kind
of
crime
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
addict
would
have
le
reason
to
prey
on
innoc
peopl
for
their
money
and
pose
in
order
to
support
their
expens
habit
legal
would
caus
the
street
price
of
drug
to
fall
substanti
so
drug
would
be
much
more
afford
to
addict
imho
the
way
to
reduc
substanc
abus
is
to
do
to
drug
what
ha
been
done
to
smoker
make
drug
use
social
unaccept
rather
than
tri
to
employ
heavyhand
law
enforc
and
punish
peopl
by

a
you
alreadi

so
on
i
propos
that
similar
method

after

they

part

that
is
a

seriou

now
im
