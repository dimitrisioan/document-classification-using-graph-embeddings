foreign
servic
offic
also
obvious
the
commun
from
madelein
albright
and
what
is
hi
reaction
to
their
call
on

m
myer
well
obvious
the
letter
wa
written
to
secretari
christoph
i
believ
secretari
christoph
receiv
the
letter
on
saturday
he
review
it
and
met
with
the
author
on
monday
to
discus
their
view
he
believ
it
an
import
part
of
the
policymak
process
and
is
take
their
view
into
account
a
we
go
forward
in
the
develop
of
the
bosnia
polici
q
what
is
the
presid
reaction
m
myer
the
presid
hasnt
seen
the
letter
it
wa
someth
that
wa
direct
toward
secretari
christoph
in
term
of
he
hasnt
seen
specif
the
letter
but
in
term
of
their
concern
gener
what
the
presid
ha
said
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
option
on
the
tabl
now
includ
one
that
werent
there
befor
and
i
think
he
a
is
everybodi
grave
concern
about
the
situat
in
bosnia
q
is
he
influenc
by
that
i
mean
how
doe
he
feel
about
the
fact
that
all
of
the
specialist
in
that
area
those
desk
offic
m
myer
mani
of
the
specialist
in
that
area
i
think
that
that
is
clearli
part
of
the
process
it
someth
their
view
will
clearli
be
consid
i
think
secretari
christoph
met
with
the
group
immedi
to
discus
their
view
i
think
he
believ
that
there
ought
to
be
room
for
opinion
and
that
those
opinion
ought
to
be
consid
particularli
from
peopl
who
work
close
on
the
issu
q
what
do
you
mean
there
are
option
on
the
tabl
that
werent
there
befor
m
myer
i
think
the
presid
said
last
week
that
there
were
option
such
a
lift
the
arm
embargo
to
the
bosnian
muslim
that
had
been
previous
off
the
tabl
that
are
now
be
consid
q
dee
dee
in
term
of
those
option
madelein
albright
is
say
that
potenti
there
could
be
unilater
action
by
the
u
if
the
european
did
not
go
along
is
that
on
the
tabl
m
myer
well
i
cant
discus
anyth
that
would
ani
convers
that
would
have
happen
between
ambassador
albright
and
the
presid
but
i
think
the
presid
ha
said
he
would
certainli
is
work
with
our
european
alli
he
had
a
number
of
convers
with
european
leader
and
is
tri
to
build
some
consensu
there
q
will
he
reach
a
decis
will
he
have
anyth
specif
to
say
today
m
myer
no
i
mean
in
term
of
there
will
be
no
new
announc
of
polici
today
q
doe
your
statement
mean
he
ha
rule
out
unilater
action
m
myer
he
continu
to
consult
with
our
alli
at
thi
point
he
ha
said
i
think
he
been
fairli
clear
about
it
that
the
he
believ
that
the
u
need
to
act
in
concert
with
it
alli
on
thi
q
on
that
point
doe
he
believ
that
the
u
though
doe
have
builtin
author
from
the
unit
nation
alreadi
to
take
unilater
action
m
myer
well
i
think
the
un
resolut
make
it
clear
that
you
can
act
unilater
in
support
of
ani
humanitarian
relief
effort
i
think
the
broader
point
is
that
anyth
we
do
ani
option
that
we
decid
to
pursu
we
will
make
sure
that
it
is
consist
with
un
author
and
if
it
not
well
work
with
our
alli
to
make
sure
that
we
get
it
q
dee
dee
then
how
doe
the
white
hous
someon
a
distinguish
a
eli
wiesel
who
say
that
not
enough
is
be
done
to
stop
the
atroc
go
on
in
bosnia
m
myer
i
think
that
that
whi
were
consid
addit
option
i
think
that
mr
wiesel
comment
yesterday
were
quit
compel
the
situat
in
bosnia
is
tragic
the
presid
is
veri
concern
about
it
he
ha
i
think
presid
clinton
ha
work
veri
hard
to
take
further
action
to
continu
to
isol
serbia
in
the
world
commun
clearli
were
consid
other
option
becaus
the
presid
is
concern
that
perhap
it
not
enough
q
in
term
of
what
you
were
just
talk
about
it
sound
like
resolut
justifi
unilater
action
by
the
u
to
protect
humanitarian
m
myer
i
dont
think
it
i
wouldnt
use
the
word
justifi
it
permit
unilater
action
by
ani
countri
in
protect
the
deliveri
of
humanitarian
relief
but
i
think
that
just
an
explan
of
the
resolut
i
think
ani
action
that
we
take
will
be
consist
with
un
resolut
or
well
work
with
our
alli
to
make
sure
that
it
is
permiss
or
well
get
further
action
q
the
presid
and
other
offici
have
rule
out
unilater
u
action
in
bosnia
in
the
past
your
declin
to
do
that
thi
morn
m
myer
no
i
said
the
presid
ha
said
repeatedli
that
he
want
to
act
in
concert
with
our
alli
on
thi
q
that
doesnt
mean
that
he
wont
act
alon
which
ha
been
said
befor
explicitli
m
myer
i
dont
mean
to
impli
a
chang
in
polici
the
presid
ha
said
all
along
that
he
want
to
act
in
concert
with
our
alli
on
thi
q
one
other
littl
question
did
he
know
about
thi
letter
from
the
foreign
servic
offic
befor
it
hit
the
paper
m
myer
i
dont
believ
so
secretari
christoph
they
may
have
had
a
privat
convers
about
it
the
presid
ha
not
seen
it
q
they
met
on
monday
right
christoph
met
sure
he
must
have
brought
that
up
m
myer
again
they
may
have
talk
privat
about
it
but
q
dee
dee
what
your
say
is
that
the
albright
recommend
ha
been
reject
is
that
correct
m
myer
no
i
didnt
say
that
at
all
i
said
i
wont
i
said
i
wouldnt
comment
on
ani
convers
or
commun
q
she
advoc
unilater
action
and
your
say
in
effect
that
we
will
not
take
unilater
action
m
myer
i
am
not
confirm
anyth
that
madelein
albright
may
or
may
not
have
recommend
q
given
the
sometim
delic
complic
and
frustrat
natur
of
negoti
with
the
alli
on
thi
issu
doe
the
presid
find
thi
kind
of
letter
from
foreign
servic
offic
of
the
state
depart
help
to
that
process
hurt
to
that
m
myer
i
think
that
their
view
are
obvious
be
consid
the
secretari
receiv
that
memo
on
saturday
and
two
day
later
he
met
with
them
in
order
to
have
a
more
thorough
air
of
their
view
of
the
basi
for
their
view
to
discus
in
greater
detail
the
option
that
they
had
present
in
the
letter
q
doesnt
it
put
some
kind
of
pressur
on
addit
pressur
on
him
now
from
within
hi
own
administr
to
act
regardless
of
what
the
alli
may
or
may
not
do
m
myer
i
think
clearli
there
a
broad
polici
review
underway
now
and
the
presid
and
hi
advisor
are
consid
a
number
of
option
includ
some
of
those
outlin
in
the
letter
from
the
folk
over
at
the
state
depart
now
no
decis
have
been
made
on
that
yet
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
through
review
underway
and
that
their
opinion
are
be
veri
serious
consid
q
if
i
can
just
follow
up
i
guess
what
im
look
for
is
what
wa
hi
reaction
to
thi
letter
did
he
say
good
thi
bolster
my
posit
or
did
he
say
damn
thi
is
just
what
i
dont
need
right
now
m
myer
i
think
he
said
thi
help
contribut
substant
to
the
debat
it
import
that
all
view
be
consid
and
air
thoroughli
that
befor
he
make
a
decis
he
want
to
have
the
best
possibl
advic
and
inform
possibl
and
thi
i
think
in
mani
way
further
that
goal
q
so
intern
advic
to
a
cabinet
offici
or
the
presid
it
all
open
now
and
you
wouldnt
take
ani
umbrag
or
say
that
they
were
out
of
line
m
myer
i
think
that
the
fact
that
secretari
christoph
met
with
them
to
discus
their
view
and
make
sure
they
had
an
opportun
to
have
a
more
complet
convers
about
it
is
conclus
evid
that
their
view
are
welcom
q
doe
the
polici
review
includ
what
madelein
albright
ha
suggest
and
what
joe
biden
and
other
have
suggest
which
is
that
the
previou
un
resolut
author
unilater
action
militari
action
for
the
deliveri
of
humanitarian
m
myer
i
think
all
option
are
on
the
tabl
q
the
unilater
option
is
on
the
tabl
m
myer
i
think
all
option
are
on
the
tabl
q
weve
had
two
differ
q
isnt
that
a
chang
dee
dee
q
that
would
be
a
chang
of
polici
q
particularli
if
it
includ
ground
troop
which
ha
been
specif
rule
out
m
myer
i
think
the
presid
ha
been
well
no
i
dont
that
is
not
q
are
you
talk
about
all
option
m
myer
all
option
i
think
the
presid
ha
been
fairli
clear
about
that
so
let
me
just
review
again
what
he
ha
said
he
ha
said
that
the
presid
ha
said
all
option
are
on
the
tabl
with
the
except
of
the
introduct
of
ground
troop
which
he
ha
never
suggest
he
ha
rule
that
out
from
the
begin
q
hasnt
he
rule
out
unilater
action
of
ani
sort
m
myer
he
ha
said
that
he
doesnt
believ
the
u
can
solv
the
problem
in
the
former
yugoslavia
by
itself
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
veri
complic
option
on
the
tabl
right
now
i
dont
think
that
again
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
specif
option
that
are
be
consid
other
than
in
the
broad
categori
that
weve
alreadi
said
thing
like
lift
the
arm
embargo
against
the
bosnian
muslim
thing
that
i
think
weve
talk
about
in
broad
term
thi
is
a
veri
complic
situat
the
option
be
present
and
consid
are
veri
complic
q
air
strike
on
the
tabl
m
myer
again
i
think
that
been
fairli
clearli
point
out
that
that
someth
that
be
discus
q
dee
dee
are
ground
troop
on
the
m
myer
no
ground
troop
are
not
be
consid
q
you
said
there
wa
not
go
to
be
you
said
you
were
not
announc
a
chang
of
polici
then
you
said
everyth
is
on
the
tabl
were
confus
are
unilater
action
on
the
tabl
m
myer
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
the
presid
ha
said
that
he
doesnt
believ
that
he
want
to
act
in
concert
with
the
alli
on
thi
q
want
to
but
he
will
to
i
mean
if
they
dont
go
along
m
myer
he
continu
to
consult
with
our
alli
on
thi
he
continu
to
have
discus
he
continu
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
that
clear
the
convers
is
ongo
were
go
to
continu
to
work
with
them
to
find
the
best
possibl
solut
and
next
step
on
thi
q
dee
dee
the
alli
have
taken
the
posit
that
to
conduct
ani
kind
of
air
strike
in
bosnia
would
have
the
opposit
effect
of
ensur
the
deliveri
of
humanitarian
aid
that
they
feel
that
their
troop
on
the
ground
monitor
the
deliveri
of
that
aid
would
becom
vulner
and
the
bosnian
m
myer
im
not
sure
that
the
consist
i
mean
im
not
sure
who
your
refer
to
q
the
british
and
the
french
q
ye
the
british
and
french
theyv
taken
the
posit
that
the
deliveri
of
humanitarian
aid
would
be
jeopard
by
ani
kind
of
air
strike
against
the
bosnian
militari
doe
the
u
believ
differ
from
that
m
myer
the
presid
ha
had
convers
with
both
mitterrand
and
major
a
you
know
i
think
that
there
is
a
thorough
review
of
polici
go
on
in
those
countri
a
well
and
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
the
natur
of
the
presid
discus
other
than
to
say
that
he
continu
to
consult
with
our
alli
a
we
move
forward
and
he
continu
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
that
process
is
ongo
q
the
other
day
vote
against
ani
militari
intervent
yesterday
doe
the
presid
regard
that
a
the
end
of
the
line
or
doe
he
doe
still
hold
out
some
possibl
of
unilater
action
the
alli
have
been
veri
veri
plain
that
they
do
not
want
to
do
anyth
m
myer
the
consult
are
ongo
that
all
i
can
tell
you
at
thi
point
q
are
you
say
that
there
wont
be
ani
announc
on
bosnia
today
in
the
press
confer
m
myer
no
that
is
not
the
intent
of
the
press
confer
q
what
is
the
intent
m
myer
it
an
opportun
to
take
question
he
may
have
a
brief
im
sure
hell
have
a
brief
open
statement
but
it
is
not
an
opportun
to
outlin
a
new
polici
on
bosnia
that
will
not
happen
q
can
you
tell
u
what
the
subject
of
the
open
statement
is
m
myer
it
sort
of
a
gener
statement
of
where
we
are
q
after
the
first
hundr
day
you
mean
m
myer
it
not
a
long
statement
i
mean
thi
is
just
gener
dont
look
for
ani
major
polici
pronounc
q
do
you
know
what
the
open
statement
is
m
myer
but
it
perhap
later
today
ill
be
abl
to
tell

more
certainti
i
think
that
still
under
review
but
the
overrid
purpos
of
thi
it
not
a
mysteri
it
not
meant
to
be
it
just
to
take
question
q
it
would
be
help
to
know
whether
what
the
open
statement
is
on
m
myer
sinc
the
major
purpos
here
is
just
to
take
question
it
not
complet
resolv
yet
q
dee
dee
one
polici
that
wa
expect
last
week
and
that
the
white
hous
you
and
georg
seem
to
indic
we
might
get
would
be
an
aid
czar
will
he
announc
that
today
and
what
the
delay
on
that
m
myer
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
impli
i
think
we
said
it
would
happen
soon
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
impli
with
ani
certainti
that
it
would
be
thi
week
it
is
come
soon
i
dont
anticip
that
happen
today
q
what
the
delay
isnt
thi
the
perfect
time
to
announc
an
aid
czar
m
myer
i
dont
know
that
it
a
delay
i
think
the
process
is
ongo
to
find
the
best
possibl
person
and
to
go
through
the
necessari
background
check
and
to
make
sure
that
weve
cross
the
t
and
dot
the
is
befor
we
make
an
announc
q
dee
dee
what
are
zoe
baird
qualif
for
the
foreign
intellig
advisori
board
and
whi
wasnt
her
appoint
announc
here
m
myer
the
qualif
i
dont
know
if
there
a
specif
list
ill
have
to
check
and
see
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
peopl
there
on
the
board
with
differ
background
mani
of
them
have
long
histori
in
intellig
or
other
govern
servic
i
think
there
a
broad
varieti
of
view
across
polit
spectrum
and
across
background
that
are
repres
there
we
never
made
a
formal
announc
other
than
the
chairman
of
the
board
which
is
admir
william
crow
q
whi
would
he
appoint
her
though
if
the
american
peopl
and
mani
in
the
senat
reject
her
for
anoth
govern
job
m
myer
i
dont
believ
that
the
american
peopl
ever
had
vote
on
her
and
i
certainli
she
wa
never
reject
in
the
senat
she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hear
but
the
presid
believ
she
a
veri
compet
person
he
said
that
zoe
baird
do
you
understand
what
the
question
is
zoe
baird

on
the
presid
foreign
intellig
q
you

she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hear
q
her
nomin
wa
withdrawn
after
public
outrag
over
violat
feder
law
m
myer
right
she
never
she

wa
reject
by
the

i
wa
just
simpli
tri
to
point
out
that

wa
never

on
by
the

q
so

practic
in
thi
administr
for

to
be
made
routin
m

and
were
happi
to

q
what
is

her
titl
what
is
the
size
of
the
board
m
myer
there
is
roughli
a
dozen
member
on
the
board
it
is
a
civilian
board
although
their
are
some
obvious
retir
militari
personnel
on
the
board
that
provid
input
into
intellig
polici
for
the
presid
again
the
chairman
of
that
board
is
admir
william
crow
q
and

he
recommend
baird
q
what
the
name
of

myer
it
the

foreign
intellig
advisori

qualif
that

employ
an

alien

do

want
to
make
a
joke
q
let
me
phrase
it
anoth
way
whi
shouldnt
thi
appoint
be
view
a
a
payback
for
the
difficulti
she
had
a
coupl
of
month
ago
m
myer
becaus
it
not
q
what
her
experi
in

intellig
m
myer
she
an
experienc
attorney
someon
who
the
presid
believ
is
veri
compet
and
qualifi
and
i
think
part
of
the
mission
of
thi
board
is
to
provid
civilian
input
not
everybodi
on
the
board
is
suppos
to
be
an
intellig
expert
that
is
not
the
board
mission
it
is
to
provid
civilian
input
for
the
presid
a
he
make
decis
regard
intellig
matter
he
believ
she
veri
qualifi
veri
compet
person
enorm
talent
and
ha
said
that
throughout
q
is
thi
just
a
figment
of
my
overact
imagin
or
wa
there
discus
earli
on
about
