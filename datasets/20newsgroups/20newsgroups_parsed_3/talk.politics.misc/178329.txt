the
point
is
that

protect
no

but
the
establish
car
dealer
or
peopl
with
enough
money
to

a
fairli

protect

but
you
seem
to
be
miss
a
more
subtl
point
it
is
not
the
govern
that
should
be
the
recipi
of
your
displeasur
but
the
establish
busi
interest
that
influenc
and
direct
govern
action
in
thi
case
it
is
the
govern
that
is
prevent
entri
to
the
market
the
desir
of
those
run
establish
busi
to
prevent
or
restrict
the
entri
of
competitor
is
an
understand
though
gener
unpleas
human
fail
but
without
a
mean
to
act
on
thi
desir
without
a
govern
with
suffici
power
to
restrict
the
option
of
the
potenti
competitor
the
anticompetit
desir
remain
just
an
unpleas
wish
the

is
the
linchpin
