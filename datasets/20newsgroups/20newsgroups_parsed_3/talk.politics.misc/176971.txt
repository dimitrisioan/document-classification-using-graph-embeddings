i
would
suggest
that
legal

defin
a
human
be
ie
a
person
whose
right
are
protect
by
the
constitut
and
the
law
a
someon
with
a
function
brain
no
if
you
want
to
use
legal
preced
you
should
take
a
look
at
the
model
penal
code
on
which
mani
state
base
their
crimin
code
my
apolog
if
i
wa
unclear
i
wa
not
tri
to
start
a
statutori
debat
sinc
there
are
mani
in
some
case
conflict
statut
on
the
book
i
wa
mere
suggest
a
paradigm
that
might
make
sen
for
a
prochoic
imho
cite
one
of
these
conflict
statut
you
keep
make
these
assert
but
you
havent
support
ani
of
them
yet
i
am
speak
of
statut
that
conflict
with
the
definit
larri
post
whi
did
you
delet
the
code
that
larri
post
also
the
model
penal
code
made
perfect
sen
to
me
were
you
perhap
confus
by
it
also
i
am
still
look
for
your
definit
the
one
you
use
clearli
indic
that
a
fetu
is
not
a
human
be
thi
is
not
like
to
plea
either
prolif
or
prochoic
but
it
is
pretti
clear
from
the
legalmed
concept
of
brain
death
brain
death
is
a
method
of
decid
when
a
known
person
is
legal
dead
there
no
analog
concept
of
brain
birth
i
have
just
coin
it
you
may
object
to
the
paradigm
but
it
would
make
our
treatment
of
human
life
statutorili
consist
circular
argument
are
usual
veri
consist
if
a
parent
ha
the
right
to
choos
to
not
take
respons
for
their
own
child
whi
are
there
law
and
penalti
against
child
abandon
thi
last
question
is
irrelev
and
someth
of
a
non
sequitur
can
you
establish
some
relev
or
even
some
sen
for
it
if
at
some
point
an
unborn
child
is
a
human
be
the
parent
clearli
have
the
same
respons
toward
her
a
ani
other
parent
have
toward
their
child
and
no
parent
can
be
forc
to
suppli
bodili
resourc
toward
their

even
if
necessari
to
save
the
child
life
there
is
a
confus
here
between
action
and
inact
a
parent
doe
not
have
to
run
out
in

of
a
bu
to
save
their

life
either
but
a

is
requir

again
your
desir

disappear
when

the

not
much
of

you
recogn
