ha
drift
into
anarchi
there
are
law
to
control
the
ownership
of
gun
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleiv
that
they
were
be
violat
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempt
to
serv
it
onli
to
be
met
with
gunfir
when
they
rang
the
doorbel
the
batf
in
a
letter
theyv
been
send
out
to
peopl
say
both
that
they
were
ambush
becaus
they
lost
the
element
of
surpris
and
that
they
went
up
and
knock
on
the
door
and
had
it
slam
in
their
face
it
strike
me
a
kind
of
strang
to
reli
on
surpris
to
serv
a
warrant
by
knock
on
the
door
presum
the
bd
did
not
mount
a
continu
state
of
alert
with
gunman
readi
to
fire
on
peopl
who
casual
walk
up
to
ring
the
doorbel
let
tri
that
again
whi
wa
the
batf
concern
about
surpris
when
they
intend
to
serv
the
warrant
by
knock
on
the
door
the
batf
appear
to
be
inconsist
in
their
own
descript
of
event
and
in
ani
case
how
doe
one
mount
an
ambush
if
one
isnt
on
alert
had
they
expect
the
bd
to
be
anyth
other
than
peaceful
citizen
who
would
accept
a
search
author
by
a
court
they
would
have
turn
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
phill
the
batf
were
in
a
firefight
with
the
bd
for
fortyf
minut
i
find
it
hard
to
believ
that
if
they
were
expect
peac
citizen
they
wouldnt
have
shown
up
in
livestock
trailer
and
would
have
retreat
immedi
not
a
smart
move
unless
meant
to
be
part
of
the
surpriz
cover
even
so
the
narrow
open
of
the
truck
simpli
wa
not
a
good
idea
a
side
open
truck
would
have
been
much
better
more
like
a
cover
waggon
so
were
the
batf
fire
on
befor
or
after
they
left
the
trailer
to
knock
on
the
door
to
serv
the
warrant
everi
descript
ive
heard
indic
the
batf
did
not
hang
around
in
the

they
decid
to
open
them
up
for
that
matter
if
they
