research
what
sort
of
research
correl
data
can
help
establish

but
it
doe
not
prove
anyth
how
can
you
expect
someon
to
make
a
decis
when
the
pdfa
on
one
hand
say
that
all

are
absolut
bad
bad
badand
thi
newsgroup
consist
refus

heroin
is
a
rel
safe
drug
what
make
it
unsaf
are
iv
administr
and
shit
like

there
are
side

they
effect
peopl
differ
ive
seen
numer
post
claim
heroin
ha
lower
addict
rate
that
cigarett
which
might
be
true
but
it
is
veri
deceiv
becaus
heroin
is
much
more
harm
drug
to
be
addict
to
than
cigarett
heroin
addict
are
far
more
prone
to
end
up
in
the
gutter
and
destroy
their
famili
and

than
peopl
addict
to
just
cigarett
stereotyp
statement
i
know
peopl
who
use
heroin
and
opiat
that
function
just
fine
in
societi
thi
group
doe
provid
some
veri
good
inform
to
peopl
but
i
am
worri
that
the
prolegalizationprodecrimin
movement
is
be
hurt
when
it
refus
to
admit
that
anysom
drug
are
veri
harm
name
some
of
these
drug
so
we
can
debat
about
them
more
specif
im
all
for
legal
of
most
drug
but
when
someon
ask
me
about
rel
risk
of
certain
drug
or
possibl
bad
side
effect
i
would
like
to
know
themand
not
be
given
the
runaround
by
thi
groupwhich
recent
tri
to
tell
me
that
pot
wa
not
harm
in
ani
manner
to
peopl
lung
no
no
no
or
at
least
i
havent
been
argu
thi
there
is
not
enough
data
to
form
a
scientif
conclus
that
doesnt
mean
that
cannabi
is
benign
to
user
lung
we
can
form
all
the
theori
we
want
but
they
are
onli
theori
some
theori
are
support
by
more
evid
than
other
and
that
make
them
stronger
i
think
it
time
yall
reexamin
your
posit
and
tri
to
understand
that
you
can
not
fight
