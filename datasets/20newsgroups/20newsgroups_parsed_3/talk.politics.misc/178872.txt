are
you
go

nation
medium
then
turn
around
and
use
it
to
support
some
posit
you
present
seem
somewhat
contradictori
doesnt
it
i
believ
that
thi
is
not
contradictori
on
the
basi
that
the
qualiti
of
medium
report
vari
greatli
base
on
the
subject
at
hand
the
medium
ha
proven
itself
veri
accur
is
the
area
of
present
raw
undisput
data
one
good
exampl
would
be
the
weather
page
in
which
high
and
low
temperatur
of
the
previou
day
for
a
larg
number
of
locat
are
post
there
is
littl
evid
to
show
that
they
are
in
error
i
believ
thi
true
when
we
speak
of
physic
data
in
the
sen
of
pure
scienc
but
when
we
speak
of
data
that
revolv
around
social
scienc
then
we
have
to
be
care
the
american
medium
ha
fail
u
in
it
analysi
of
complex
event
howev
im
sure
that
we
can
come
up
with
mani
news
stori
that
have
left
u
angri
becaus
so
mani
fact
have
been
ommit
case
that
come
to
mind
are
the
invas
of
panama
the
war
with
iraq
the
disast
in
waco
the
issu
surround
the
accept
of
gay
into
the
militari
the
war
on
drug
and
mani
other
i
quit
agre
but
these
are
case
or
news
event
that
contain
polit
social
scienc
inform
sociolog
etc
and
at
best
are
reflect
of
the
group
that
report
them
a
you
have
point
out
it
is
difficult
to
report
that
the
temperatur
wa
degre
when
it
wa
degre
and
have
peopl
believ
you
the
stori
that
you
bring
to
light
wa
regard
the
new
sex
survey
while
im
sure
that
due
to
lazy
some
of
the
data
wa
ommit
from
the
articl
i
would
ventur
to
guess
that
the
data
that
wa
present
did
not
deviat
from
the
survey
i
do
howev
think
that
it
would
be
folli
to
have
blind
faith
in
a
singl
newswrit
analysi
of
thi
data
in
thi
particular
case
there
wa
littl
analysi
and
the
reader
wa
left
to
draw
hisher
own
convict
ye
and
no
the
survey
present
accord
to
mr
cramer
a
valu
call
the
median
which
one
use
thi
make
u
believ
that
of
the
male
had
plu
sex
partner
and
of
the
male
had
or
le
sex
partner
homosexu
are
purport
to
make
up
onli
in
thi
case
the
major
of
peopl
with
plu
sex
partner
are
heterosexu
it
is
my
feel
that
median
wa
not
the
intend
word
usag
but
if
it
is
then
we
have
littl
evid
to
support
mr
cramer
claim
about
gay
promiscu
hetero
promiscu
mani
netter
mr
cramer
includ
often
forget
that
the
american

are
mere
a
number
of
busi

purpos

make
money

the

the
