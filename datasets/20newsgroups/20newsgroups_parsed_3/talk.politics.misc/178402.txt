i
am
in
the
minor
for
advoc
such
back
in

to
make
the
canadian
insur
look
more
like
real
health
insur
which
actual
it
is
the
new

parti
a
breakoff
of
traditionalist
from
the
conserv
with
a
mildli
libertarian
faction
hold
our
public
health
insur
a
an
untouch
but
that
just
a
few
peopl
have
to
be
remind
that
it
not
free
the
averag
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscal
naiv
than
their
american
counterpart
on

like
these
im
one
of
the
few
peopl
who
favour
copay
forget
about
leftist
even
our
conserv
attack
me
for
it
on
the
canadian
newsgroup
to
make
it
look
more
like
real
insur
co
the
insur
payment
is
hidden
unlik
in
franc
and
if
you
didnt
know
it
youd
believ
it
actual
is
social
medicin
american
conservativeslibertarian
and
canadian
leftist
are
the
onli
one
who
serious
call
it
that
canadian
arent
worri
about
the
american
who
spend
were
worri
about
the
french
and
german
who
spend
to
our
so
the
insur
is
look
at
thing
that
shouldnt
be
paid
for
out
of
gener
fund
like
physic
for

polici
sick

the
reason
that
the
canadian
health
insur
hasnt
spiral
out

despit
be
open
and
univers
is
that
unlik
