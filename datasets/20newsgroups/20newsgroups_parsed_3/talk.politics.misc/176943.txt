here
first
white
male
dont
do
anyth
a
a
class
individu
white
male
invent
those
thing
which
mean
noth
to
white
male
a
a
whole
second
you
neglect
to
mention
charl
manson
hitler
mccarthi
jack
the
ripper
ted
bundi
and
a
whole
slew
of
individu
who
have
done
horribl
evil
thing
if
white
male
can
take
the
credit
for
our
fellow
white
male
boon
we
must
also
take
the
blame
for
our
fellow
blight
i
claim
we
deserv
neither
credit
nor
blame
for
these
thing
white
male
need
to
wake
up
and
realiz
that
theyr
be
unfair
ye
but
everyon
el
need
to
wake
up
and
realiz
that
be
unfair
right
back
is
disgust
racist
and
sexist
whi
cant
we
learn
to
treat
everyon
fairli
without
gener
what
stupid
gene
make
thi
so
difficult
id
like
to
buy
the
world
a
clue
the
word
that
is
miss
in
thi
whole
discours
is
not
the
b
word
or
the
h
word
or
even
the
n
or
w
word
it
is
the
l
word
loser
that
right
when
we
boil
all
the
crap
out
of
thi
argument
it
is
all
about
win
and
lose
and
noth
el
let
me
explain
in
the
meantim
there
is
guilt
for
win
mayb
a
fear
that
one
doesnt
deserv
one
bounti
or
success
so
there
is
a
kinder
and
gentler
type
of
politician
these
day
bill
clinton
affirm
action
and
lot
of
discours
about
peopl
who
dont
get
it
for
those
of
u
in
the
win
busi
thi
kind
of
talk
is
mildli
irrit
but
there
is
still
no
suggest
of
lose
who
is
dfen
anyway
the
answer
is
a
plain
a
the
horn
rim
on
your
face
the
guy
is
michael
dougla
pose
a
a
loser
thi
is
known
a
controversi
cast
but
that
baggi
shortsleev
white
shirt
sure
doe
look
natur
on
mike
doesnt
it
gordon
gekko
will
never
look
the
same
though
woodi
alway
dress
that
way
did
we
realli
expect
gekko
to
take
it
easi
and
enjoy
that
kind
of
wardrob
without
put
up
a
fuss
what
we
are
start
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
bash
dfen
is
the
same
game
a
bash
that
poor
african
american
slug
that
clint
eastwood
use
to
blow
away
all
the
time
a
that
archwasp
male
gender
georg
c
scott
declaim
american
tradit
love
to
win
they
love
a
winner
and
will
not
toler
a
loser
and
so
on
sinc
we
are
talk
in
theori
and
opinion
then
ill
put
in
my
first
a
rebuttl
person
i
love
underdog
unlik
bandwagon
jumper
i
abandon
team
when
they
start
win
peopl
that
cheer
for
winner
just
becaus
they
are
winner
are
insecur
peopl
who
are
afraid
to
be
associ
with
someth
neg
the
polit
implic
are
simpl
if
a
mani
socialist
and
democrat
do
you
consid
societi
a
finit
pie
to
a
apport
in
some
equit
way
then
you
have
to
worri
about
who
is
a
winner
and
who
is
a
loser
to
tell
whose
side
you
are
on
that
could
be
black
woman
today
asian
homosexu
tommorrow
and
ye
inde
white
men
some
yet
to
be
determin
day
when
the
balanc
of
the
pie
ha
final
swung
against
that
minor
on
thi
one
point
i
agre
the
reason
that
peopl
bash
wasp
is
becaus
they
have
been
on
top
for
a
long
time
whoever
is
on
top
is
go
to
oppress
whoever
is
below
them
so
that
they
can
stay
on
top
if
hannib
had
push
on
to
rome
after
hi
victori
at
canna
we
might
all
be
bash
the
black
for
oppress
u
peaceful
white
peopl
for
all
these
centuri
i
serious
doubt
that
if
the
black
had
conquer
the
world
that
they
would
have
treat
their
coloni
ani
betterwors
than
the
white
did
the
white
race
did
some
unspeak
thing
to
the
other
race
of
the
world
but
they
onli
did
what
ani
other
conquer
race
would
have
done
ie
khan
the
real
question
is
should
we
carri
over
that
blame
to
the
present
gener
who
didnt
particip
in
the
crime
would
it
do
ani
good
ha
it
done
bosnia
ani
good
they
are
fight
war
that
stop
hundr
even
thousand
of
year
ago
my
opinion
is
if
there
are
inequ
now
then
let
chang
them
but
dont
blame
me
for
what
my
ancestor
did
it
wouldnt
settl
anyth
anyway
either
way
you
go
the
way
of
the
winner
is
no
longer
the
way
to
be
popular
at
least
after
you
graduat
from
high
school
but
youll
still
be
popular
at
high
school
reunion
but
it
beat
be
a
nerd
a
i
would
imagin
michael
dougla
would
now
agre
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
onli
way
to
go
that
where
you
are
dead
wrong
you
dont
join
up
on
a
side
just
becaus
they
are
win
that
make
you
spineless
win
in
high
school
and
after
high
school
is
still
the
best
way
to
be
popular
but
it
doesnt
make
you
right
all
the
best
caus
in
histori
were
loo
caus
with
onli
a
coupl
except
win
onli
make
a
differ
to
other
peopl
not
to
yourself
and
what
good
is
the
opinion
of
other
peopl
if
they
onli
care
how
you
appear
ie
a
winner
if
you
cant
beat
them
fight
them
everi
inch
of
the
way
