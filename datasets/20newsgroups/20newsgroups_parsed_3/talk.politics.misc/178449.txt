hendrick
write
im
not
sure
whi
you
dont
consid
it
an
option
no
one
suggest
that
such
analysi
should
be
left
to
regul
in
fact
the
reinvent
govern
movement
provid
just
such
a
costbenefit
approach
to
the
analysi
of
public
spend
libertarian
would
do
well
to
learn
more
about
it
okay
let
me
tri
to
explain
thi
when
one
vote
for
such
a
creatur
a
a
senat
or
wors
yet
a
presid
one
vote
not
for
specif
polici
but
for
a
gener
packag
which
must
cover
all
issu
for
or
year
a
such
one
influenc
is
highli
dilut
i
might
add
that
even
if
one
were
free
to
vote
on
individu
regul
the
vast
amount
of
time
requir
for
consid
a
particular
regul
combin
with
the
veri
small
chanc
of
one
vote
make
a
differ
would
make
it
unreason
to
expect
the
voter
to
make
an
intellig
decis
with
respect
to
specif
regul
sorri
but
it
strike
me
that
it
is
the
onli
feasibl
approach
what
is
not
feasibl
is
a
wholesal
attack
on
all
govern
regul
and
licens
that
treat
cut
hair
and
practic
medicin
a
equival
task
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
feasibl
in
thi
case
do
you
mean
that
are
imposs
in
pricipl
or
mere
that
it
would
be
undesir
in
fact
actual
the
onli
area
of
public
spend
abov
that
strike
me
a
gener
substanti
support
among
libertarian
are
polic
and
defens
of
the
four
you
saw
fit
to
mention
and
educ
of
minor
is
alway
anoth
possibl
sinc
minor
are
gener
consid
not
to
be
respons
to
make
their
own
decis
a
adult
are
it
is
an
interest
asid
that
a
commit
a
libertarian
claim
to
be
to
a
principl
of
noncoercion
the
onli
area
of
public
spend
that
they
frequent
support
involv
hire
peopl
with
gunshmmm
you
say
thi
a
if
it
were
surpris
yet
in
fact
a
necessari
consequ
of
libertarian
philosophi
all
noncoers
function
should
be
dealt
with
privat
therefor
it
follow
that
the
onli
function
remain
to
the
state
are
the
coersiv
one
perhap
you
have
may
i
suggest
that
you
consid
that
revolutionari
frequent
gener
support
by
act
a
protector
of
geezer
mother
and
child
govern
that
ignor
such
peopl
on
the
ground
that
we
dont
have
much
to
fear
from
them
do
so
at
their
own
peril
much
more
like
it
drunken
teenag
the
group
in
questionar
more
like
to
be
wors
off
dure
and
after
a
revolut
than
befor
in
the
unlik
event
that
you
miss
my
earlier
sarcasm
let
me
say
thi
directli
the
idea
that
such
program
a
social
secur
or
afdc
should
be
consid
defens
an
idea
which
ha
been
advanc
in
th
and
other
newsgroup
is
so
absurd
a
lie
a
to
be
unworthi
of
consider
do
you
serious
disput
thi
i
dont
want
to
seem
patron
but
you
still
seem
to
be
labor
under
the
delus
that
under
a
social
econom
system
it
is
reason
intellig
and
honest
person
like
yourself
who
make
the
decis
i
feel
ani
third
parti
ad
to

is
everi
bit
a
like
to
be
ignor
or
corrupt
a
the
buyer
or

i
dont
expect
you
to
agre
with

but
you
explain
