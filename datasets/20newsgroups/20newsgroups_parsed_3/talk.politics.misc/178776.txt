so
i
need
not
consum
more
bandwidth
here
the
problem
with
the
egalitarian
view
is
that
it
tri
to
deni
the
fundament
dilemma
of
democrat
govern
the
peopl
have
a
right
to
exercis
a
voic
in
their
commun
yet
individu
have
the
right
to
be
left
to
themselv
thi
is
a
seriou
dilemma
precis
becaus
there
is
not
much
that
take
place
in
a
vacuum
you
are
serious
misus
the
word
egalitarian
you
should
look
the
word
up
befor
you
use
it
there
is
a
vast
differ
between
equal
justic
under
the
law
and
egalitarian
what
i
meant
if
it
wa
not
clear
wa
the
intersect
set
of
liber
and
libertarian
philosophi
of
natur
right
and
how
the
govern
and
constitut
interpret
in
particular
fit
into
that
philosophi
thi
philosophi
engag
in
the

seriou
practic
error
of
endow
the

the

may

sinc
that
seem
to
be
aok
with
you
if
the
feder
constitut
explicitli
prohibit
you
from
do
so
the
feder
govern
would
prevent
you
from
do
so
if
it
did
not
and
you
could
muster
enough
local
support
to
pa
an
amend
to
the
local
constitut
by
say
a
major
empow
the
local
govern
to
do
so
then
i
would
have
to
vote
with
my
foot
and
move
to
a
neighborhood
more
friendli
to
my
own
system
of
valu
thi
is
not
an
ideal
situat
but
it
is
far
better
than
the
mess
we
are
mire
in
right
now
a
to
the
gang
of
pitchfork
and
torch
wield
friend
there
are
veri
few
restrict
local
law
that
i
person
would
advoc
or
vote
for
sinc
i
am
of
the
view
that
exercis
govern
power
over
your
neighbor
should
be
done
with
extrem
care
and
onli
when
absolut
necessari
but
i
do
believ
in
protect
child
from
victim
by
peopl
who
have
callou
disregard
for
the
effect
they
have
on
other
i
would
certainli
leav
a
wellbehav
massag
parlor
alon
so
long
a
it
had
no
detriment
effect
on
the
neighborhood
you
just
dont
get
it
the
debat
is
not
whether
you
or
a
communit
would
or
would
not
vote
away
my
right
it
is
the
proprieti
of
whether
that
should
even
be
an
option
when
you
defin
right
veri
broadli
there
is
no
practic
choic
about
whether
peopl
will
or
will
not
infring
upon
your
right
sinc
these
right
overlap
even
when
right
are
defin
veri
narrowli
the
govern
ha
been
empow
to
prevent
other
from
infring
on
your
right
the
fundament
question
is
by
whose
author
is
that
power
creat
if
you
support
the
current
situat
with
a
natur
right
suprem
court
rather
than
an
origin
understand
suprem
court
or
even
better
suprem
court
by

you
are
consent
to
have
nine
lawyer
in
washington
dc
creat
those
power
out
of
the
air
in
my
fractal
feder
scenario
it
is
a
broad
consensu
of
the
peopl
ie
the
amend
process
that
creat
those
power
certainli
not
the
onli
caus
mike
but
peopl
in
a
local
neighborhood
should
have
a
voic
in
what
go
on
in
that
neighborhood
to
deni
thi
is
to
creat
anoth
concentr
central
power
to
keep
the
local
from
abus
it
power
you
mean
that
horrif
central
power
the
individu
no
i
mean
the
feder
govern
that
come
truck
in
with

to
tell
the
