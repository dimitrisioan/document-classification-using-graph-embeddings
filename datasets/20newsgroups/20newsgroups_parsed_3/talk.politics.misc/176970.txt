is
an
unborn
child
a
human
be
at
ani
point
dure
pregnenc
in
my
opinion
at
all
point
dure
the
pregnanc
it
is
human
youll
have
to
defin
what
you
mean
by
human
be
for
me
to
answer
the
question
a
put
a
parallel
q
is
a
person
of
color
a
human
be
a
youll
have
to
defin
what
you
mean
by
human
be
to
answer
your
irrelev
question
ye
a
person
of
color
is
human
but
i
still
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
human
be
and
you
have
mere
beg
the
question
without
respond
by
tri
to
inject
the
notion
of
race
into
the
discus
you
muddi
the
water
without
ad
ani
insight
whatev
the
same
parallel
question
could
be
is
a
polydactyl
person
a
human
be
you
still
have
not
answer
what
you
mean
by
human
be
plea
do
so
i
would
suggest
that
legal
preced
defin
a
human
be
ie
a
person
whose
right
are
protect
by
the
constitut
and
the
law
a
someon
with
a
function
brain
could
you
cite
some
of
those
preced
for
me
or
the
basi
of
thi
definit
while
the
law
doe
allow
the
remov
of
extraordinari
mean
of
sustain
life
in
case
of
brain
death
thi
in
itself
doe
not
lead
to
your
conclus
of
how
the
law
defin
a
human
be
howev
at
least
you
defin
human
be
in
a
tenuou
fashion
that
is
a
person
whose
right
are
protect
by
the
constitut
and
the
law
for
my
answer
to
your
question
i
refer
you
to
roe
v
wade
and
subsequ
suprem
court
decis
which
defin
to
what
extent
a
fetu
is
protect
by
the
constitut
and
the
law
certain
judg
have
concur
that
slaveri
is
not
a
violat
of
human
right
therefor
it
is
not
you
wont
answer
the
question
and
instead
drag
in
irrelev
if
you
want
a
definit
of
human
be
that
doe
not
depend
on
the
vagari
of
law
but
hold
solid
whatev
the
law
may
rule
provid
it
for
me
i
would
suggest
that
your
blind
faith
would
not
like
hold
up
if
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot
the
brain
lifedeath
paradigm
is
one
that
i
suggest
a
one
consist
with
other
legal
definit
it
clearli
doesnt
matter
to
you
whether
an
unborn
child
ha
ani
right
or
not
howev
so
the
point
is
lost
on
you
more
irrelev
a
larri
margoli
point
out
the
law
ha
made
special
except
in
order
to
includ
fetus
but
doe
not
follow
your
version
of
human
be
and
a
he
point
out
brain
death
is
not
a
mean
of
determin
who
ha
the
right
of
the
live
but
rather
who
ha
die
there
is
a
signific
differ
what
i
am
wonder
now
is
ha
your
argument
so
fail
you
that
you
feel
it
necessari
to
drag
out
irrelev
and
leav
the
thread
you
start
you
got
answer
to
your
question
when
you
began
bait
me
if
you
recal
after
you
had
made
some
ridicul
remark
about
adrienn
regard
and
have
been
correct
chang
the
subject
with
your
remark
about
have
a
discus
of
substanc
if
you
realli
want
a
discus
of
substanc
whi
then
do
you
disregard
logic
and
substanc
in
order
to
toss
silli
accuss
eg
it
realli
doesnt
matter
to
you
if
it
matter
to
you
then
whi
not
defin
human
be
and
seek
some
substanc
your
not
go
to
convinc
a
logic
person
of
the
right
of
your
posit
unless
you
appli
some
logic
and
show
some
mean
to
your
word
if
she
is
then
whi
doe
the
mother
have
the
right
to
kill
her
when
she
is
in
the
womb
but
not
after
she
ha
pas
through
the
birth
canal
becaus
a
woman
ha
a
right
to
have
ani
object
which
threaten
her
health
and
is
within
the
confin
of
her
bodi
remov
the
other
side
of
the
argument
would
give
right
to
the
fetu
that
would
not
be
grant
to
an
adult
human
if
for
exampl
you
were
occupi

whatev
reason
or
through
whatev
mean
the
reason
and
mean
be
irrelev
that
other
would
be
abl
to
remov
or
have
you
remov
if
that
remov
requir
your
demis
i
see
no
reason
in
law
that
such
a
remov
could
not

examin

if
one
siames
twin
ha

remov
know
that
it
will
caus
death
and
bar
some
emerg
where
they
will
both
die
anyway
it
is
murder
is
it
have
you
ani

for
thi
assert
furthermor
your

siames
twin
have
an
equal

they
have

what
establish
thi

beyond
your

it
is

a

of
which
came

can
not

your

fail
not

posse
make
a
differ
here
a
woman
womb
is
indisput

own
also
i
see
you
ignor
my
statement
that
you
would
grant
right
to
a
fetu
that
would
not
be
grant
a
born
human
be
wa
that
due
to
it
inconveni
you
see
the
right
to
life
is
grant
to
adult
human
in
the
same
sen
a
it
should
be
to
the
foetu
at
some
point
prior
to
birth
are
siames
twin
ever
separ
in
the
womb
or
is
thi
right
you
assert
for
siames
twin
which
i
dont
even
think
is
true
a
state
or
valid
a
an
analog
one
that
exist
after

freivald
your
entir
argument
here
is
a
failur
interest
way
of
tri
to
combin
two
essenti
orthogon
concept
the
point
is
that
it
is
murder
for
one
siames
twin
to
kill
the
other
regardless
of
their
statu
of
physiolog
depend
or
interdepend
is
it
plea
cite
a
preced
and
the
basi
of
the
rule
it
would
be
difficult
for
one
siames
twin
to
kill
the
other
insid
the
womb
and
even
if
it
were
possibl
i
doubt
that
a
case
could
be
made
for
premedit
or
negleg
note
the
use
of
the
phrase
it
should
be
in
my
post
you
simpli
assert
thing
without
ani
support
your
analog
is
not
accur
and
your
assert
are
unsupport
tri
thi
on
for
size
it
is
not
murder
for
one
siames
twin
to
kill
the
other
in
the
womb
there
we
now
have
equal
argument
but
the
idea
is
illog
for
one
siames
twin
to
kill
the
other
in
the
womb
would
like
be
to
kill
itself
a
well
the
system
are
depend
on
each
other
for
life
im
still
struggl
to
see
anyth
analag
here
and
fail
to
do
so
of
cours
the
situat
is
not
a
perfect
comparison
it
may
well
be
that
one
siames
twin
deliber
initi
oppress
or
coersion
against
the
other
thi
is
clearli
not
the
case
with
an
unborn
child
and
thi
last
statement
from
you
is
a
total
non
sequitur
the
comparison
is
far
wors
than
you
give
it
credit
for
are
you
go
to
let
thi
assert
stand
on
it
own
also
or
do
you
plan
on
follow
up
with
a
reason
argument
your
argument
is
from
fantasi
island
your
comparison
is
a
total
failur
a
i
have
demonstr
alreadi
and
ha
no
basi
in
realiti
neither
legal
nor
medic
and
for
you
to
assert
that
it
is
not
a
perfect
comparison
becaus
of
the
imposs
that
of
coercion
or
oppress
is
ridicul
a
i
said
you
give
the
analog
too
littl
credit
for
failur
on
the
one
hand
you
start
thi
by
say
you
want
to
take
a
real
rather
than
a
hypothet
situat
then
you
fli
off
into
siames
twin
murder
one
anoth
in
the
womb
or
coerc
or
oppress
each
other
in
the
womb
when
the
realiti
of
the
situat
you
describ
in
now
way
match
your
version
a
i
said
befor
decis
are
made
regard
which
twin
live
and
die
in
situat
where
they
can
not
both
surviv
and
furthermor
a
i
have
alreadi
said
there
is
a
differ
between
an
equal
claim
to
organ
and
a
claim
that
is
unequ
you
seem
to
be
assert
that
a
fetu
ha
a
claim
on
a
woman
womb
when
the
fetu
is
born
what
happen
to
it
claim
and
by
what
reason
do
you
assert
it
claim
if
a
parent
ha
the
right
to
choos
to
not
take
respons
for
their
own
child
whi
are
there
law
and
penalti
against
child
abandon
thi
last
question
is
irrelev
and
someth
of
a
non

can
you
establish
some
relev
or
even
some
sen
for
it
if
at
some
point
an

is
a
human
be
the
parent
clearli
have
the

a

other

have

what
is
the
relev
you
have
establish
no

is
you
ignor
the

differ
between
a

the

most
of

conced
that
the

supersed
all
of

you

instantan
it

argu
that
