waco
and
panama
i
havent
recogn
ani
name
from
previou
discus
but
i
do
notic
that
there
are
a
few
who
blame
clinton
for
the
action
of
the
batf
in
waco
unless
you
felt
the
same
way
about
what
we
did
under
bush
direct
command
in
panama
it
just
partisan
whine
which
is
what
i
expect
most
of
it
to
be
i
can
see
no
way
to
condemn
one
and
not
the
other
but
im
sure
some
limbot
will
tell
me
how
kill
thousand
of
panamanian
civilian
to
serv
an
arrest
warrant
is
much
better
than
allow
religi
fanat
to
commit
suicid
follow
a
botch
attempt
by
the
batf
to
serv
a
search
warrant
