although
there
a

of
peopl
who
have
public
decis
in
support
of
the
vat
but
the
presid
ha
not
made

q
at

with
hi
own
task
forc
advis
have
they
discus
the
fund
issu
and
what
the
possibl
option
would
be
mr

i
dont
think
that
that
ha
been
present
for
a
decis
no
q
not
for
a
decis
but
ha
it
been
discus
a
an
option
mr
stephanopoulo
again
there
are
a
lot
of
level
of
brief
i
do
not
believ
that
the
vat
ha
been
present
to
the
presid
a
okay
thi
is
someth
for
you
to
decid
on
q
your
not
say
he
didnt
know
it
wa
be
consid
though
are
you
mr

no
he
said
it
be
consid
q
he

that
q
but
ha
he
discus
that
with
hi
advis
that
what
im
ask
mr

ha
said
it
be
consid
i
do
not

what
level
of
discus
there
ha
been
over
the

it

someth
the
work
group
are
look
at
i
dont
even
know
that
it
q
but
he
didnt
say
he
wa
consid
did
he
at
thi
stage
mr
stephanopoulo
no
he
is
not
i
think
were
get
into
someth
of
a
metaphys
debat
right
here
what
is
consid
q
well
he
is
the
one
who
said
i
havent
review
it
mr
stephanopoulo
that
is
true
that
is
what
i
just
repeat
q
georg
is
there
ani
concern
here
that
a
a
result
of
the
definit
statement
he
made
in
februari
and
the
promis
that
if
it
were
to
be
consid
hed
let
u
know
and
have
it
trickl
out
the
way
it
did
that
there
may
now
be
the
develop
of
a
credibl
gap
on
thi
issu
and
other
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
think
so
i
mean
it
is
now
public
knowledg
that

is
be
consid
q
is
he
or
you

all
embarrass
about
the
absolut
statement

to
the
effect
that

they

ask
q
the
new
york
time
report
today
that
secretari
reich
and
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
depart
use
appl
and
orang
number
in
order
to
portray
last
month
unemploy
figur
in
a
way
that
wa
support
of
the
presid
job
stimulu
bill
but
which
turn
out
to
be
total
fals
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
know
if
it
wa
total
fals
but
i
think
laughter
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
depart
did
grant
that
it
wa
an
inappropri
mix
and
they
say
that
q
the
question
is
is
the
presid
concern
about
behavior
that
amount
to
corrupt
govern
data
and
what
he
do
about
it
if
so
mr
stephanopoulo
the
chief
economist
ha
said
that
a
mistak
wa
made
it
wont
happen
again
and
that
the
end
of
the
matter
q
isnt
that
the
same
inform
that
goe
to
the
presid
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulu
packag
mr
stephanopoulo
there
two
separ
piec
of
inform
i
think
that
where
the
confus
wa
q
when
did
you
all
first
learn
about
thi
mistak
that
wa
made
mr
stephanopoulo
i
read
the
articl
thi
morn
q
and
a
far
a
you
know
is
the
presid
awar
of
it
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
so
q
and
wa
he
awar
of
it
befor
he
read
about
it
in
the
new
york
time
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
know
not
to
my
knowledg
q
did
you
ever
hear
about
it
befor
thi
morn
anyth
mr
stephanopoulo
i
didnt
q
wasnt
the
presid
given
an
erron
spin
on
thi
for
hi
own
purpos
for
hi
speech
for
hi
argument
mr
stephanopoulo
well
again
im
not
sure
both
statement
are
true
what
the
labor
depart
ha
grant
is
that
mix
them
in
one
sentenc
essenti
wa
mislead
they
said
it
wa
a
mistak
they
said
they
wouldnt
do
it
again
q
did
they
drop
it
is
thi
someth
that
you
choos
to
spin
or
make
an
issu
of
mr
stephanopoulo
whenev
fewer
peopl
are
out
of
work
were
gratifi
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
need
to
get
thi
job
packag
go
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulu
packag
for
a
minut
you
said
that
the
presid
plan
to
come
forward
with
an
amend
is
the
timet
still
what
it
wa
that
the
amend
would
be
laid
down
on
monday
and
vote
on
on
tuesday
or
did
he
in
the
convers
with
dole
talk
about
the
possibl
of
put
that
off
for
a
few
more
day
to
give
more
time
for
the
discus
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
at
thi
point
there
no
chang
in
the
schedul
at
all
i
dont
know
that
they
discus
the
time
like
that
q
do
you
believ
that
your
closer
or
get
closer
thi
week
than
you
were
last
week
mr
stephanopoulo
again
i
believ
that
were
go
to
pas
a
job
packag
the
presid
is
prepar
to
make
adjust
in
order
to
get
that
to
happen
i
dont
know
where
the
vote
are
on
clotur
at
thi
particular
time
i
dont
know
what
go
to
happen
until
we
have
a
vote
but
the
presid
believ
deepli
in
thi
job
packag
and
want
to
get
it
done
q
ha
there
been
ani
indic
that
thi
situat
ha
chang
mr
stephanopoulo
were
go
to
continu
to
work
on
it
well
know
when
the
vote
are
taken
q
georg
last
week
you
said
that
there
are
or
variou
peopl
in
the
administr
were
say
that
you
couldnt
go
through
dole
you
were
go
to
have
to
tri
and
go
around
him
becaus
he
wa
immov
on
thi
subject
of
a
compromis
or
at
least
the
compromis
he
want
wa
not
anyth
like
the
one
that
you
could
accept
thi
week
your
talk
to
him
is
that
becaus
youv
realiz
that
the
peel
off
effort
wasnt
go
to
work
mr
stephanopoulo
that
becaus
senat
dole
want
to
talk
to
the
presid
about
the
stimulu
packag
q
he
initi
the
convers
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
q
secretari
reich
thi
morn
said
that
in
fact
the
presid
is
not
will
to
compromis
on
thi
bill
at
all
you
say
he
make
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
know
that
that
exactli
what
he
said
i
think
he
said
he
didnt
have
ani
indic
that
there
wa
ani
compromis
yet
or
that
there
would
be
a
compromis
and
the
presid
doesnt
want
to
compromis
and
the
presid
doesnt
want
to
compromis
but
if
he
ha
to
make
adjust
to
get
it
through
he
will
q
offici
here
yesterday
said
that
panetta
wa
work
on
a
seri
of
adjust
that
might
be
made
public
befor
the
actual
vote
mr
stephanopoulo
it
possibl
q
today
mr
stephanopoulo
im
not
sure
exactli
when
that
will
happen
but
i
think
that
it
veri
possibl
that
well
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
differ
packag
or
senat
democrat
will
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
differ
packag
in
order
to
get
it
pas
q
a
we
understood
hi
convers
with
dole
the
first
one
wa
some
discus
of
thi
and
ill
get
back
to
you
tonight
with
some
detail
or
some
adjust
or
whatev
the
phrase
is
did
he
offer
him
some
detail
or
some
adjust
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
it
a
question
of
how
detail
i
mean
i
think
they
had
a
gener
discus
about
the
packag
last
night
subsequ
to
their
convers
yesterday
afternoon
i
believ
that
there
will
be
followup
discus
today
in
the
senat
not
necessarili
between
the
presid
and
senat
dole
and
let
me
just
reiter
neither
side
ha
made
specif
compromis
at
thi
date
when
we
have
someth
well
let
you
know
and
im
not
suggest
that
senat
dole
ha
accept
anyth
that
weve
talk
about
or
that
weve
offer
anyth
in
a
hard
way
q
what
are
the
followup
discus
if
not
the
presid
and
dole
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
senat
mitchel
is
go
to
talk
to
senat
dole
q
is
that
a
threat
laughter
q
did
the
presid
say
to
senat
dole
all
right
how
about
thi
number
a
an
overal
size
or
did
dole
say
to
the
presid
i
can
go
a
high
a
thi
did
they
talk
number
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
think
it
wa
a
negoti
in
that
respect
it
wa
more
of
a
discus
about
their
posit
q
did
they
discus
actual
number
mr
stephanopoulo
im
just
not
sure
i
know
they
talk
about
the
basic
outlin
of
the
packag
i
think
they
talk
about
the
program
they
care
about
i
dont
know
if
they
got
to
the
level
of
thi
mani
xbillion
dollar
q
doe
dole
have
to
sign
off
befor
there
is
a
packag
mr
stephanopoulo
no
of
cours
not
q
did
the
white
hous
have
anyth
to
do
with
the
protest
who
show
up
in
new
hampshir
today
where
senat
dole
wa
speak
wa
that
in
ani
way
organ
by
mr
stephanopoulo
not
to
my
knowledg
no
q
and
ha
the
presid
been
in
touch
with
senat
kohl
or
feingold
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
think
he
talk
to
them
no
q
georg
is
the
presid
consid
the
more
palat
fact
of
have
a
nation
sale
tax
instead
of
have
the
have
have
to
continu
pay
for
the
havenot
and
is
he
go
to
scrap
hi
propos
tax
on
the
privileg
few
with
the
have
have
to
pay
for
the
havenot
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
believ
deepli
that
the
tax
rate
on
upper
incom
american
a
he
present
in
hi
budget
should
go
up
and
i
think
for
the
second
half
of
your
question
ill
refer
you
to
my
brief
from
yesterday
q
georg
on
the
subject
of
accuraci
in
inform
you
suggest
the
other
day
that
the
stimulu
packag
includ
money
that
would
solv
the
water
problem
in
milwauke
appar
that
is
not
true
it
actual
wast
water
money
mr
stephanopoulo
it
wast
water
money
for
wisconsin
and
some
could
go
to
milwauke
q
but
it
would
not
affect
the
drink
water
problem
becaus
it
wast
water
money
right
mr
stephanopoulo
it
would
affect
the
water
treatment
overal
q
but
the
implic
from
your
statement
the
other
day
wa
that
it
would
help
fix
thi
diseas
problem
in
milwauke
now
would
you
agre
that
not
the
case

overal
water
treatment
in
wisconsin
q
a
leftov
question
from

which
wa
when

q
so
sometim

about
perhap
the
vat
tax
be
okay
if
it
replac
the
btu
tax
so
doe
the
presid
feel
that
perhap
thi
might
be
in
place
of
some
other
tax
he
propos
or
is
thi
total
in
addit
to
the
other
tax
he
alreadi
propos
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
weve
said
all
we
have
to
say
about
the
vat
at
thi
point
i
mean
there
just
no
thi
is
be
consid
by
the
health
care
work
group
and
that
is
all
the
presid
hasnt
made
ani
further
decis
beyond
that
q
but
it
would
be
to
financ
health
care
it
wouldnt
be
to
replac
some
other
tax
that
financ
it
wouldnt
replac
the
incom
tax

instanc
mr
stephanopoulo

on
that
q

a
chanc
mr

i
have
no
idea
q
is
that
a
consider
whether
you
all
put
it
forward
mr
stephanopoulo
that
would
becom
a
consider
if
the
presid
were
to
decid
to
do
it
it
not
in
consider
now
q
you
said
at
the
begin
of
the
brief
that
circumst
had
chang
and
that
had
caus
the
vat
to
now
be
under
consider
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
what
the
presid
refer
to
thi
morn
these
group
came
forward
and
said
thi
is
someth
that
ha
to
be
consid
q
those
are
the
circumst
that
have
chang
that
the
onli
differ
between
now
and
when
he
emphat
rule
it
out
that
group
have
ask
it
to
be
consid
mr
stephanopoulo
that
what
he
said
q
is
that
true
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
q
wa
there
in
fact
some
understand
that
sin
tax
would
not
produc
enough
money
for
the
health
care
benefit
mr
stephanopoulo
im
not
go
to
get
into
the
deliber
q
but
georg
mr
stephanopoulo
no
what
the
consider
is
a
the
presid
said
group
came
forward
and
said
thi
is
someth
you
ought
to
consid
the
work
group
are
look
at
it
q
is
that
the
onli
thing
that
chang
sinc
hi
prior
statement
and
your
prior
statement
on
the
vat
mr
stephanopoulo
ye
q
can
you
explain
how
those
group
how
that
inform
got
to
him
that
group
want
it
wa
it
just
read
the
newspap
or
did
group
make
present
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
the
group
a
you
know
the
health
care
task
forc
ha
met
with
dozen
of
group
q
but
thi
is
the
presid
knowledg
that
these
group
had
come
forward
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
he
wa
refer
to
what
wa
come
to
the
work
group
obvious
there
have
also
been
publish
posit
in
the
newspap
q
have
certain
group
brief
him
on
the
group
present
to
them
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
know
if
theyv
brief
him
i
mean
how
detail
the
brief
have
been
i
know
that
the
work
group
decid
to
look
into
thi
after
be
press
by
these
group
q
what
kind
of
argument
did
the
group
make
that
were
persuas
enough
that
the
presid
would
chang
the
posit
that
he
had
enunci
previous
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
know
it
just
theyv
had
longstand
posit
that
thi
would
be
a
good
way
to
financ
health
care
q
the
presid
wasnt
awar
of
those
longstand
posit
mr
stephanopoulo
he
may
have
been
at
some
level
obvious
he
been
a
governor
for
a
long
time
and
he
know
the
basic
argument
for
and
against
a
vat
tax
q
what
were
tri
to
figur
out
here
your
tell
u
that
the
onli
chang
the
onli
thing
that
affect
thi
chang
in
the
presid
attitud
toward
the
vat
between
februari
and
now
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
attitud
hasnt
necessarili
chang
i
mean
he
ha
not
made
a
decis
q
i
know
but
the
presid
said
that
it
wa
off
the
tabl
so
did
you
and
your
say
that
the
onli
thing
that
chang
is
the
posit
of
these
group
except
your
also
describ
them
a
longstand
posit
i
dont
see
the
chang
if
these
group
havent
had
ani
chang
in
their
posit
that
been
made
to
the
presid
mr
stephanopoulo
well
theyv
made
the
present
to
the
health
care
task
forc
q
there
no
relationship
at
all
between
the
fact
that
sin
tax
that
he
had
said
suggest
in
februari
that
he
favor
will
not
produc
enough
revenu
to
financ
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
think
he
ever
suggest
that
they
would
produc
all
the
revenu
q
well
he
suggest
that
he
thought
that
those
were
appropri
way
to
financ
health
care
mr
stephanopoulo
he
did
say
that
i
dont
know
that
he
said
anyth
to
refut
that
q
but
in
fact
ha
the
task
forc
discov
that
there
wouldnt
be
enough
revenu
from
those
tax
to
financ
the
kind
of
core
benefit
mr
stephanopoulo
again
i
dont
think
that
the
task
forc
ever
suggest
that
there
would
q
georg
if
he
advoc
a
vat
tax
would
that
break
hi
promis
not
to
rais
tax
on
the
middl
class
to
pay
for
hi
program
mr
stephanopoulo
i
cant
comment
on
a
hypothet
situat
q
but
doe
that
promis
would
that
promis
not
to
rais
tax
on
the
middl
class
to
pay
for
the
program
prevent
him
from
seek
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
ha
made
no
decis
on
the
vat
tax
when
he
doe
well
tell
you
and
well
explain
the
implic
then
q
which
specif
group
can
you
cite
busi
labor
or
otherwis
whose
recommend
to
the
health
care
task
forc
ha
prompt
thi
consider
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
have
the
specif
i
just
dont
have
that
q
georg
can
you
tell
u
to
what
extend
these
other
altern
for
instanc
the
employ
tax
or
the
sin
tax
or
other
financ
option
are
also
still
on
the
tabl
and
what
these
option
are
mr
stephanopoulo
no
a
member
of
the
task
forc
and
repres
of
the
work
group
have
said
they
are
look
at
a
wide
varieti
of

i
think
that
ira

differ
option
under

but
im
not
go
to
comment
q
what
the
scope
mr
stephanopoulo
im
just
not
go
to
comment
on
them
no
q
what
the
scope
of
the
need
how
much
are
you
talk
about
that
ha
to
be
produc
by
one
or
a
combin
of
the
mr
stephanopoulo
that
what
the
health
care
task
forc
is
look
at
q
sinc
there
not
go
to
be
ani
brief
on
the
miyazawa
visit
two
question
one
gener
what
doe
the
presid
hope
to
use
that
meet
for
but
more
specif
is
hi
task
complic
by
the
japanes
anger
over
the
vancouv
note
and
the
remark
about
market
access
at
the
press
confer
mr
stephanopoulo
the
vancouv
note
q
doe
no
mean
ye
q
ye
and
no
mr
stephanopoulo
well
i
dont
know
i
saw
the
prime
minist
press
confer
where
he
wa
ask
the
question
about
that
note
and
he
gave
a
veri
graciou
and
complet
answer
when
he
wa
ask
the
question
the
question
of

are
someth
that
certainli
will
be
discus
between
the
prime
minist
and
the
presid
there
is
obvious
a
trade
imbal
between
japan
and
the
u
that
we
want
to
do
someth
about
q
also
in
those
comment
the
prime
minist
made
he
suggest
that
the
unit
state
should
come
down
heavi
on
him
in
term
of
trade
are
you
go
to
oblig
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
the
presid
will
state
our
view
on
trade
veri
clearli
and
our
view
on
the
trade
deficit
veri
clearli
i
dont
necessarili
want
to
agre
with
your
character
of
the
prime
minist
comment
q
that
we
need
specif
export
target
specif
numer
target
is
that
what
he
go
to
discus
with
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulo
theyr
go
to
have
a
broad
discus
of
a
wide
rang
of
trade
issu
i
dont
want
to
get
into
those
specif
until
after
the
meet
q
whi
q
that
the
crux
of
the
issu
right
whether
or
not
doe
the
presid
believ
that
without
specif
numer
target
it
is
realli
a
he
said
in
hi
press
confer
sort
of
hopeless
that
thi
is
go
to
chang
veri
much
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
believ
that
we
must
have
pressur
on
japan
to
turn
the
trade
imbal
around
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
specif
of
how
that
would
be
done
q
but
doe
the
presid
believ
that
their
stimulu
packag
announc
yesterday
will
rectifi
the
imbal
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
first
the
presid
want
to
get
a
full
brief
on
the
stimulu
packag
from
prime
minist
miyazawa
himself
and
then
hell
make
the
comment
on
it
q
how
about
the
russian
aid
packag
there
seem
to
be
some
confus
about
how
the
u
view
that
secretari
christoph
say
or
bentsen
say
the
japanes
may
need
to
do
more
the
japanes
say
that
that
not
what
they
heard
mr
stephanopoulo
again
were
go
to
continu
to
work
with
all
our
alli
in
the
g
and
were
go
to
continu
to
press
for
help
for
russian
reform
russian
democrat
reform
and
i
think
that
so
far
we
had
a
veri
good
announc
out
of
tokyo
and
were
go
to
continu
to
work
with
our
alli
for
bilater
packag
q
do
you
think
the
japanes
need
to
do
more
mr
stephanopoulo
were
go
to
continu
to
work
with
all
our
alli
to
do
a
much
a
we
can
q
secretari
christoph
wa
ask
today
on
the
today
show
thi
morn
what
he
thought
of
margaret
thatcher
comment
on
the
bosnia
polici
and
he
said
it
a
rather
emot
respons
mr
stephanopoulo
over
an
emot
issu
q
right
to
an
emot
problem
doe
the
white
hous
condon
that
kind
of
remark
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
that
secretari
christoph
remark
speak
for
itself
the
presid
believ
also
that
thi
is
a
deepli
troubl
situat
that
were
tri
to
find
answer
for
q
but
that
specif
rather
emot
respons
specif
term
mr
stephanopoulo
no
it
speak
for
itself
q
in
connect
with
that
doesnt
it
seem
that
with
the
number
of
peopl
who
are
be
kill
at
thi
veri
moment
is
it
good
american
polici
to
put
off
some
decis
that
might
be
made
now
to
help
bori
yeltsin
win
a

mr
stephanopoulo
for
exampl
q
to
take
stronger
action
to
take
militari
action
air
strike
anyth
that
can
be
done
mr
stephanopoulo
the
presid
believ
that
what
must
be
done
now
is
to
push
harder
for
sanction
he
is
also
a
you
know
the
administr
ha
been
discus
lift
the
arm
embargo
he
believ
those
are
the
appropri
way
to
increas
pressur
at
thi
time
q
what
is
your
respons
to
the
critic
who
would
say
that
the
u
is
now
stymi
by
tri
to
help
bori
yeltsin
retain
the

mr
stephanopoulo
theyr
wrong
were
press
hard
for
the
serb
to
come
to
the
negoti
tabl
were
press
hard
for
increas
sanction
and
were
talk
to
our
alli
about
the

embargo
q
you
were
put
great
store
in
vanc
and
owen
get
peopl
to
agre
to
that
now
vanc
and
owen
have
both
said
that
militari
forc
to
some
extent
would
be
accept
doe
that
chang
your
think
mr
stephanopoulo
clearli
were
go
to
listen
to
whatev
peopl
who
have
put
so
much
time
into
a
situat
have
to
say
but
at
thi
point
the
presid
is
move
forward
on
sanction
and
talk
about
the
arm
embargo
q
a
followup
on
a
dee
dee
comment
thi
morn
she
said
she
would
be
abl
to
provid
some
administr
offici
who
could
document
the
effect
the
sanction
are
have
in
bosnia
are
you
go
to
be
abl
to
do
that
or
do
you
have
anyth
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
think
that
what
she
said
q
that
exactli
what
she
said
mr
stephanopoulo
i
dont
think
that
true
but
what
she
said
we
would
look
into
the
situat
of
what
kind
of
evid
can
be
provid
in
bosnia
obvious
if
there
are
connect
between
the
bosnian
serb
and
the
serb
in
belgrad
and
we
are
tighten
the
screw
on
the
serb
in
belgrad
that
will
have
an
effect
over
time
i
do
not
know
day
by
day
minut
by
minut
what
kind
of
help
is
be
given
between
the
two
and
what
the
exact
effect
ha
been
but
clearli
we
are
slow
the
shipment
of
good
into
belgrad
we
are
have
an
effect
on
the
serb
there
what
kind
of
effect
that
will
eventu
have
on
the
bosnian
serb
i
dont
know
but
one
thing
i
would
say
is
if
it
were
have
no
effect
at
all
i
dont
know
whi
theyd
be
fight
it
so
much
q
are
the
first
ladi
tax
return
go
to
be
releas
mr
stephanopoulo
i
think
there
a
joint
tax
return
and
it
will
be
probabl
later
today
q
is
the
presid
consid
sign
an

order

i
dont
think
there
ani
propos
for
that
at
thi
time
not
that
i
know
of
q
it
someth
that
the
presid
promis
dure
