one

face
the
question
of
how
one
circumscrib
govern
power
and
keep
it
circumscrib
in
a
complex
societi
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalist
nor
consum
to
refrain
from
use
govern
power
for
their
own
end
but
apart
from
that
littl
conundrum
thi
is
a
difficult
problem
for
which
there
is
no
obvious
good
solut
one
approach
is
simpli
to
tri
and
move
polit
opinion
and
hope
a
new
more
libertarian
consensu
last
for
a
while
anoth
approach
is
to
tri
and
amend
the
constitut
the
origin
constitut
restrain
the
u
govern
from
econom
intervent
for
to
year
depend
on
just
how
one
want
to
count
it
the
first
amend
though
weaken
in
mani
way
still
restrain
govern
particularli
state
and
local
even
though
on
mani
particular
issu
the
major
is
in
favor
of
censorship
i
think
libertarian
would
be
happi
with
anoth
year
of
restraint
via
an
amend
or
two
not
that
i
think
that
like
to
happen
not
necessarili
mr
hendrick
but
other
poster
seem
to
see
thi
a
a
problem
with
libertarian
that
it
can
not
be
stabl
that
might
be
true
but
it
is
not
an
object
to
libertarian
per
se
if
a
libertarian
polit
consensu
form
for
a
decad
or
two
and
then
fall
apart
again
we
would
just
be
back
where
we
are
now
thi
is
unlik
the
case
for
social
where
a
socialist
consensu
that
held
for
a
while
and
then
fell
apart
would
not
leav
u
where
we
are
now
but
instead
with
lot
of
bureaucraci
that
would
be
hard
to
get
rid
of
if
not
tyranni
a
the
end
condit
of
a
strong
socialist
consensu
