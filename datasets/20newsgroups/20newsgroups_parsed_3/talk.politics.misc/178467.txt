ok
i
dont
care
if
rodney

satan
himself
there
just
no
excus
now
whether
they
did
it
becaus
he
wa
black
or

did
it
becaus
they
want
to
beat
up
on
somebodi
they

arrest
is
anoth
entir
separ
question
that
i
have
insuffici
inform
to

ani
kind
of
conclus
about
how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a
bunch
of
cop
put
their
live
o
n
the
line
day
in
and
day
out
who
are
afraid
a
hell
of
a
larg
black
guy
that
took
a
larg
amount
of
punish
and
refus
submit
oh

the
start
of

of
hi
prone
postion
and
charg
the
cop
sorri

wa
when

watch
it
start
to
finish
i
have
to
agre
with
you
the
polic
may
have
carri
it
a
bit
too
far
but
rodney
king
wa
no
angel
either

been
return
im
sure

whi
they
hand
down
guilti
verdict
on
two
of
the
offic
it
quit
simpl
realli
it
wa
a
compromis
to
avoid
riot
in
the
place
where

it
right
to
riot
i
hate
to
say
thi
but
i
would
have
like
to
see
