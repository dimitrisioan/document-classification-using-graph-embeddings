easili
embrac
by
non

when

in
our
commun
from
your

you
appar
find
the
idea

appeal
i
never
ceas
to

amaz
at
how
eager
non

are
to
embrac
theori
about
our
problem
which
basic
assert
that
someth
is

the
socioeconom
factor
which
we
know
help
to
produc
high
crime
level
like
poverti
which

i
mean
when
it
come
to
discus
of
african
american
problem
we
somehow
becom
exempt
from
all
these
type
of
factor
and
the

is
laid
at
the

of
some
neboul
dysfunct
we
supposedli
have

nobodi
attribut
crime
amongst
white
american
to
dysfunct
no
that
ha
socioeconom
factor
to
it
but
for
africa
american
it
got
ta
be
a
dysfunct
basic
i
think
thi
tendenc
for
non
african
american
to
believ
that
someth
is
wrong
with
u
exist
becaus
non
african
american
dont
want
to
deal
with
the
possiblil
that
the
societi
is
deepli
bias
against
african
american
and
that
thi
is
about
of
the
problem
it
could
not
possibl
be
that
the
societi
is
so
deepli
racist
and
structur
against
u
that
thi
ha
a
veri
effect
neg
effect
on
u
no
someth
is
wrong
with
u
non
african
american
are
quick
to
disregard
what
we
have
to
say
becaus
they
are
so
busi
tri
to
find
someth
wrong
with
u
instead
of
take
a
good
hard
look
at
the
