base

we
alway
taught

you
can

teach
your

that
the
perpetr
of

no
more
repres
the

racist
hate
white
repres
the

although
there
are
mani
ethnic

trap
that
you

struggl
with
and
believ
otherwis
the
trap
is
the
easi
way
out
for
yourself
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
realiz
that
the
demograph
relat
to
the
crime
you
speak
of
have
le
to
do
with
race
and
much
to
do
with
socioeconom
statu
and
disenfranchis
your
go
to
find
higher
crime
within
ani
commun
compris
of
ani
ethnic
group

that
ha
becom
dysfunct
whatev
the
factor
lead
to
that
dysfunct
with
ethnic
minor
it
is
more
usual
than
not

socioeconom
disenfranchis
if
for

you
live
in
an
area
where
there
were
veri
few

quit
a

youd
see
the

statist
reflect
the

of
those

would

your
