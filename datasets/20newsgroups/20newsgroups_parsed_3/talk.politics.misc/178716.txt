write

articl
richard
wojcik
write
directli
contradict
by
the
nejm
studi
that
compar
crime
in
seattl
and
vancouv
bc
the
nongun
rate
were
roughli
the
same
for
both
citi
the
differ
in
violent
crime
rate
wa
almost
total
gunrel
and
a
wa
not
point
out
in
the
studi
but
in
critiqu
of
it
two
seper
articl
by
jame
wright
and
david
kopel
come
to
mind
it
wa
point
out
that
the
differ
wa
also
almost
entir
minor
relat
that
is
the
gun
crime
rate
skyrocket
for
poor
minor
black
and
hispan
primarili
while
when
you
compar
the
white
major
they
were
virut
ident
mani
of
the
peopl
who
never
read
the
nejm
articl
believ
that
thi
critiqu
is
valid
in
fact
the
studi
explor
the
minor
issu
at
length
and
cite
studi
to
back
up
it
content
that
poverti
not
minor
type
is
the
relev
factor
in
violenc
statist
perhap
i
fail
to
make
myself
clear
minor
in
the
u
correl
with
poverti
thi
isnt
good
and
we
should
address
it
but
we
shouldnt
ignor
that
minor
and
poverti
do
tend
to
go
togeth
doe
vancouv
have
a
consistantli
poor
popul
drawn
along
racial
line
if
it
doesnt
then
assumpt
of
be
abl
to
compar
minor
v
major
in
both
citi
is
question
at
best
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
those
area
implement
gun
control
becaus
of
the
high
rate
true
onli
to
a
certain
extent
take
washington
dc
where
gun
control
wa
institut
while
it
had
crime
problem
true
but
that
crime
proceed
to
explod
afterward
similarli
for
new
york
actual
i
dont
know
whether
ani
seriou
studi
have
been
done
for
both
citi
usenetstyl
statist
argument
are
not
veri
seriou
usual
involv
peopl
sit
by
comput
with
the
latest
world
almanac
figur
i
had
heard
of
a
studi
on
washington
dc
that
seem
to
indic
a
signific
drop
in
gunrel
violenc
there
after
the
law
were
implement
i
heard
gari
kleck
comment
on
the
radio
that
he
thought
the
declin
in
suicid
rate
wa
relat
to
the
new
law
but
he
doubt
their
affect
on
other
gunrel
violenc
i
have
never
seen
a
report
on
the
studi
nor
have
ani
of
my
progun
friend
had
much
to
say
about
that
report
rememb
you
cant
just
say
that
crime
increas
indic
a
failur
of
the
law
to
affect
crime
rate
you
dont
know
whether
the
rate
of
increas
would
have
been
differ
without
the
law
if
the
rate
of
increas
over
a
period
of
sever
year
remain
unchang
or
increas
i
think
it
not
a
far
jump
to
say
that
the
law
are
not
effect
no
you
cant
sit
down
and
say
that
thing
wouldnt
have
been
wors
i
dont
have
a
crystal
ball
and
neither
do
you
howev
that
road
lead
u
to
a
place
where
it
is
imposs
to
critiqu
ani
action
if
it
get
down
to
be
it
might
have
been
wors
without
them
then
there
is
no
valid
object
which
im
sure
would
amus
certain
peopl
to
no
end
you
dont
know
whether
the
law
prevent
a
threefoldincreas
or
fail
to
stop
a
twofold
increas
so
weve
got
a
situat
where
we
have
sever
option
the
crime
rate
decreas
obvious
gun
control
work
the
crime
rate
remain
the
same
it
would
have
been
wors
without
gun
control
the
crime
rate
increas
perhap
the
law
prevent
an
even
bigger
increas
cute
test
ground
weve
got
all
respons
support
the
proposit
that
gun
control
work
the
question
is
thi
did
washington
dc
experi
an
increas
in
it
violent
andor
gun
crime
rate
which
wa
greater
than
the
pattern
indic
prior
to
the
implement
gun
control
law
if
it
did
then
the
suggest
that
the
problem
the
gun
control
law
were
design
to
control
did
not
exist
in
their
entireti
prior
to
the
gun
control
law
