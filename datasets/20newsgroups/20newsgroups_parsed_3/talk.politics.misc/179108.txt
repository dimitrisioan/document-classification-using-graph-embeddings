phil
ronzon
wrote
a
veri
well
put
togeth
post
i
disagre
with
sever
key
point
but
the
post
is
an
excel
one
with
which
to
engag
in
discours
i
agre
wholeheartedli
paul
you
have
handl
thi
so
well
i
think
that
you
could
write
ballot
materi
thank
you
id
hope
to
avoid
the
rancor
that
ha
character
much
of
the
debat
on
thi
issu
im
also
not
go
to
prolong
the
debat
on
thi
i
want
to
respond
to
a
coupl
of
the
point
you
make
but
thi
will
be
my
last
post
on
thi
no
dont
stop
right
to
equal
opportun
let
call
it
reo
involv
coercion
in
all
case
by
definit
one
question
is
it
your
posit
that
there
is
no
reo
or
just
that
thi
is
a
lesser
right
to
foa
good
question
it
just
depend
how
that
for
an
answer
serious
i
believ
that
it
depend
on
wether
or
not
you
are
talk
about
a
government
employ
or
not
in
thi
case
i
believ
that
there
should
be
absolut
no
discrimin
direct
or
indirect
period
i
feel
thi
way
not
becaus
it
would
offend
my
moral
sensibl
which
it
of
cours
would
but
becaus
the
govern
is
a
coerciv
entiti
which
we
can
not
escap
it
boggl
my
mind
that
in
my
lifetim
there
were
white
onli
drink
fountain
in
some
park
but
no
fountain
for
other
yet
the
tax
garnish
to
support
those
fountain
certainli
were
not
appli
to
white
onli
in
essenc
we
can
not
escap
the
coerciv
state
even
randi
weaver
have
to
pay
properti
tax
on
the
other
hand
privat
employ
are
not
a
monopoli
and
their
busi
should
be
run
by
them
and
not
by
the
govern
unless
they
elect
to
turn
their
affair
over
to
that
govern
whi
say
who
whi
can
mom
pop
have
foa
but
ibm
be
forc
and
forc
is
the
correct
word
here
to
have
reo
in
the
case
of
the
mom
pop
store
their
foa
is
directli
affect
they
a
individu
will
have
to
associ
with
whomev
they
hire
in
the
case
of
ibm
i
ask
again
whose
foa
are
we
protect
i
do
not
accept
that
ibm
a
a
corpor
entiti
ha
a
right
to
foa
but
if
the
mom
pop
store
is
affect
by
who
they
hire
isnt
ibm
there
is
a
slipperi
slope
here
in
santa
cruz
where
a
number
of
looni
antidiscrimin
law
exist
a
guy
su
a
restaur
for
not
hire
him
becaus
he
had
everi
imagin
kitchen
utensil
dangl
from
hi
earlob
and
hi
tatoo
were
veri
distract
suddenli
by
arm
wave
by
magic
a
landlord
doe
not
have
foa
and
on
what
basi
doe
the
foa
of
the
landlord
disappear
it
seem
that
vagu
term
like
no
contact
with
tenant
suffic
on
the
basi
that
the
landlord
ha
no
contact
with
hisher
tenant
if
the
landlord
doesnt
associ
with
hi
tenant
then
how
can
he
complain
that
hi
foa
is
be
violat
i
have
a
lot
of
interact
all
posit
with
my
tenant
so
i
guess
that
that
isnt
an
issu
but
say
i
were
to
buy
a
unit
in
anoth
town
and
have
it
manag
by
a
third
parti
let
say
that
i
have
a
real
avers
to
christian
becaus
of
the
stuff
that
they
buy
into
hook
line
and
sinker
and
becaus
of
the
lunat
schmuck
that
they
tri
to
get
elect
i
dont
want
ani
of
those
fish
symbol
hang
in
the
window
of
a
hous
that
i
own
should
the
govern
interven
if
i
wa
eli
weizel
and
the
onli
rental
applic
wa
tom
metzger
should
i
be
forc
to
rent
thi
distant
unit
to
him
the
compani
on
the
fortun
for
exampl
are
all
privat
own
they
can
give
you
a
list
of
all
of
their
owner
they
have
no
anonym
unknown
to
them
owner
publicli
own
in
the
sen
that
their
stock
is
publicli
trade
and
that
the
share
of
stock
are
own
by
a
gener
and
everchang
public
ye
and
the
neat
thing
about
thi
is
that
unlik
the
mom
pop
store
you
and
i
can
buy
share
in
ibm
and
have
influenc
over
their
decis
