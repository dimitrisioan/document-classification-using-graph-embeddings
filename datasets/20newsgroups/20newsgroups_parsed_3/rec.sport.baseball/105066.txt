sam

say
ye
everyon
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
the
yanke
are
final
move
in
the
right
direct
they
should
finish
over
thi
year
and
mayb
even
be
in
the
pennent
race
in
august
howev
i
would
take
back
a
few
move
the
jim
abbott
trade
bleagh
thi
wa
a
terrif
trade
snow
will
certainli
be
better
than
mattingli
in
the
futur
but
that
theyll
be
about
the
same
now
is
a
defens
opinion
abbott
is
one
of
the
few
truli
great
pitcher
in
the
game
today
wade
bogg
im
not
sure
about
thi
one
i
think
that
it
good
in
that
a
pre
bogg
kick
hayesmeulenswhoev
as
and
that
a
bogg
still
isnt
all
that
shabbi
it
bad
though
that
the
yanke
expect
a
pre
bogg
and
will
probabl
get
a
bogg
howev
id
still
play
bogg
over
hay
or
bam
bam
spike
owen
you
have
my
full
agreement
here
he
not
all
that
much
better
than
velard
and
silvestri
is
just
about
a
lock
to
be
better
than
him
howev
i
do
enjoy
the
fact
that
spike
is
not
a
nicknam
not
that
thi
help
the

much
much
rather
have
