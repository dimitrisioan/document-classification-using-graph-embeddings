the

selv
sound
like
a
new
yorklik
stori
to
me
i
saw
the
replay
and
am
wonder
what
the
big
deal
is
i
didnt
realiz
the
folk
in
la
were
make
a
big
to
do
about
it
i
think
stawberri
lasorda
and
the
variou
medium
type
should
sit
and
watch
the
replay
then
apolog
to
the
fan
other
have
question
whi
darryl
should
be
so
concern
with
what
the
fan
did
when
he
ha
a
grand
total
of
rbi
through
the
first
nine
game
darryl
ha
not
gotten
off
to
a
good
start
he
ha
to
blame
someon
but
i
guess
the
big
debat
continu
a
to
what
are
the
respons
of
the
fan
a
long
a
the
fan
doesnt
interfer
with
the
play
i
see
no
problem
