tri
to
expand
it
appeal
to
peopl
with
shorter
attent
span
ie
the
footbal
crowd
invari
all
the
argument
from
peopl
who
dont
like
to
watch
basebal
on
tv
say
the
same
thing
the
game
are
too
long
and
too
bore
basebal
is
tri
to
find
a
way
to
shorten
the
game
for
wider
tv
appeal
if
you
look
at
it
though
basebal
game
last
around
the
same
amount
of
time
a
footbal
game
the
differ
is
that
there
is
more
action
in
that
durat
in
footbal
game
perhap
if
there
were
more
action
in
basebal
game
you
would
get
more
of
those
fan
to
tune
in
anyway
come
up
with
a
solut
to
make
basebal
more
appeal
to
a
bigger
crowd
is
go
to
be
difficult
on
soapbox
yet
anoth
reason
to
get
a
commision
now
sinc
it
obviou
that
rule
basebal
by
comitte
work
about
a
fast
a
a
snail
race
in
nebraska
off
soapbox
how
can
you
say
there
is
more
action
in
footbal
then
basebal
a
footbal
game
consist
of
approxim
play
and
the
averag
durat
of
a
play
is
around
second

mean
that
in
a
game
that
last
approxim
hour
you
have
about
minut
s
of
action
in
a
basebal
game
you
have
upward
of
two
hundr
