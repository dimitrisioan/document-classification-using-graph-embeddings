my
analysi
of
jose

circa
sep
and
jose
canseco
circa
june
he
bulk
up
too
much
period
he
need
to
lose
about
pound
not
gain
more
bulk
ive
been
say
that
for
at
least
year
now
and
even
the
a
condit
guru
told
jose
he
wa
carri
too
much
weight
and
lose
some
would
help
hi
backalthough
i
dont
for
one
second
believ
jose
use
steroidshi
back
problem
are
veri
similar
to
problem
alot
of
steroid
user
experi
becaus
they
are
simpli
carri
too
much
weight
on
their
framese
jeff
bregel
ex
er
a
a
textbook
exampl
and
imho
jose
is
too
big
for
hi
frame
hi
bat
speed
ha
absolut
vanish
conserv
id
say
he
lost
of
hi
bat
speed
and
that
a
huge
amount
of
speed
i
cant
imagin
how
to
estim
bat
speed
but
it
pretti
obviou
that
jose
is
miss
fastbal
he
use
to
hit
like
due
to
hi
back
that
open
stanc
is
kill
him
note
that
he
act
sort
of
like
brian
down
way
open
to
start
then
close
up
a
ball
is
releas
down
could
do
thi
without
signific
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
alway
close
hi
stanc
the
same
way
sometim
hi
hip
are
open
sometim
theyr
fulli
close
without
a
good
start
point
it
hard
to
make
adjust
in
your
swing
i
dont
know
he
had
an
even
more
open
stanc
when
he
first
came
up
with
the
a
and
had
no
problem
with
it
then
it
might
be
that
preback
problem
he
wa
quick
enough
to
cover
up
ani
defici
the
stanc
caus
but
now
he
lost
just
enough
bat
speed
that
the
stanc
hurt
him
the
old
say
if
your
hot
it
a
trigger
mechan
if
your
cold
it
a
hitch
first
minim
movement
befor
the
swing
close
and
widen
the
stanc
and
sever
cut
down
the
stride
i
take
on
my
swing
hope
thi
will
cut
down
on
the
time
i
need
to
swing
and
will
allow
me
to
move
the
bathead
more
freeli
the
biggest
problem
imho
is
he
never
ha
found
a
stanc
he
comfort
with
for
more
than
a
few
month
he
chang
hi
stanc
so
much
he
lose
track
of
where
the
strike
zone
is
in
wednesday
night
game
he
wa
clearli
mad
at
strike
call
on
both
corner
that
look
pretti
good
to
me
i
think
he
no
longer
know
where
the
strike
zone
realli
is
becaus
he
chang
hi
stanc
so
much
im
also
a
bit
concern
that
becaus
he
got
palmer
and
gonzalez
hit
all
the
homerun
hell
becom
competit
swing
even
harder
and
screw
himself
up
even
wors
larussa
alway
said
that
canseco
famou
bat
practic
homer
show
did
him
more
harm
than
good

they
encourag
bad
hit
habit
