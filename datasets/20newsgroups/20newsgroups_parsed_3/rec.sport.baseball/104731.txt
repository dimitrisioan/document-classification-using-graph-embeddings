eric
roush
write
that
hed
been
thrown
out
and
gant
had
a
legitim
beef
about
the
pitch
that
wa
call
a
strike
a
reason
umpir
would
not
have
tri
to
forc
gant
back
into
the
box
in
that
situat
a
reason
umpir
would
do
a
he
been
instruct
to
do
thi
season
get
the
batter
back
in
the
box
sooner
to
tri
to
cut
down
on
the
ridicul
length
of
game
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
thi
happen
and
hope
more
umpir
will
do
a
hirschbeck
did
in
instruct
the
pitcher
to
pitch
if
the
batter
wont
get
back
in
the
box
while
i
can
see
whi
they
want
to
cut
down
on
the
time
spent
walk
around
gant
wasnt
order
back
in
the
box
sooner
he
wa
order
back
immedi
a
soon
a
he
step
out
hirschbeck
told
him
to
get
back
in
the
box
now
gant
doesnt
take
a
lot
of
walk
between
pitch
the
onli
reason
he
did
then
becaus
he
wa
veri
bother
by
the
call
i
expect
hi
concentr
wasnt
there
yet
and
in
a
crucial
situat
i
imagin
it
best
to
be
a
calm
a
possibl
contribut
factor
would
be
gant
bad
day
at
the
plate
bad
year
at
the
plate
and
the
brave
long
score
drought
now
it
pretti
stupid
to
go
ahead
and
talk
the
walk
when
the
umpir
is
tell
you
to
get
in
there
you
know
the
umpir
is
go
to
do
someth
call
for
a
strike
throw
you
out
etc
gant
wa
wrong
but
hirschbeck
wa
more
wrong
in
my
bias
view
asid
from
the
major
chip
he
seem
to
have
on
hi
shoulder
what
wa
the
problem
gant
had
a
reason
to
want
some
time
disput
strike
call
gant
hadnt
been
wast
time
all
game
the
game
had
been
cruis
along
and
wa
just
over
two
hour
old
the
score
wa
with
out
in
the
ninth
and
a
runner
in
score
posit
is
there
ani
reason
hirschbeck
couldnt
and
shouldnt
cut
gant
a
littl
slack
for
no
discern
construct
reason
hirschbeck
disrupt
the
game
caus
a
five
minut
delay
and
materi
hurt
the
batter
in
a
key
situat
did
he
have
a
date
to
get
to
and
i
still
wonder
whi
terri
wa
toss
earlier
in
the
game
dale

it
is

good
to
