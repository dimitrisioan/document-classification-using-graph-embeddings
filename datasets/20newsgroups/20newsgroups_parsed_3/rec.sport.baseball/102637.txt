subject
al
east
is
best
in
basebal
is
there
ani
doubt
that
thi
is
true
after
a
few
down
year
the
al
east
is
back
to
where
it
wa
in
the
earli
eighti
with
the
emerg
of
the
o
and
the
yank
it
is
far
and
away
the
best
while
the
nl
west
ha
the
best
team
in
basebal
and
the
red
arent
bad
either
they
have
noth
els
the
giant
astro
and
padr
all
have
talent
they
do
not
have
the
all
arounf
team
that
are
found
in
the
al
east
and
the
dodger
just
plain
suck
a
for
the
rocki
who
know
the
al
east
ha
the
defend
champ
and
although
they
lost
a
lot
to
free
agenc
toronto
is
still
one
of
the
best
in
basebal
the
oriol
have
the
preseason
favorit
to
win
the
cy
young
in
mike
mussina
and
you
can
never
forget
about
ripken
the
sign
of
harold
bain
and
harold
reynold
dont
hurt
to
much
either
although
i
alway
like
bill
ripken
while
they
let
a
lot
go
thi
summer
randi
milligan
joe
orsulak
bill
ripken
bob
milacki
sam
horn
storm
davi
and
craig
leffert
they
kept
the
heart
of
their
team
intact
my
predict
finish
baltimor
could
be
a
bias
opinion
ny
yanke
toronto
milwauke
detroit
boston
cleveland
would
have
been
higher
if
not
for
the
accid
go
