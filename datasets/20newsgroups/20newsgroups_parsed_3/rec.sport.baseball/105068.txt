write
the
subject
line
say
it
all
what
is
the
rule
that
qualifi
a
pitcher
a
make
a
save
imho
thi
is
the
most
untrustworthi
silli
stat
by
today
rule
in
all
of
basebal
my
understand
is
to
qualifi
a
a
save
a
pitcher
can
not
pitch
more
than
three
inning
and
the
potenti
tie
run
must
at
least
appear
in
the
ondeck
circl
also
the
lead
a
pitcher
enter
with
can
not
exced
three
run
thi
is
a
phenomenon
known
around
work
a
readyfireaim
i
am
astound
at
the
number
of
time
peopl
post
strong
opinion
about
thing
they
not
onli
dont
understand
but
publicli
admit
to
not
understand
in
fact
there
a
plausibl
argument
that
save
are
a
more
ration
stat
than
win
for
the
record
there
are
two
way
that
a
reliev
can
get
a
save
he
must
finish
the
game
and
either
have
enter
the
game
with
the
tie
run
on
base
at
bat
or
on
deck
have
pitch
at
least
three
inning
effect
a
pitcher
may
not
get
a
win
and
a
save
in
the
same
game
i
believ
that
the
offici
scorer
must
assert
more
of
their
author
in
determin
winnerssaversetc
for
instanc
a
pitcher
can
come
in
in
the
ninth
with
a
lead
blow
the
lead
fall
behind
have
hi
team
come
back
in
the
next
half
inning
and
earn
the
win
ha
thi
pitcher
earn
a
win
no
way
but
thi
is
an
argument
that
win
is
a
dumb
stat
not
save
i
guy
could
pitch
five
strong
inning
of
middl
relief
and
see
hi
teammat
ralli
to
tie
the
score
assum
he
came
in
to
start
the
fourth
and
left
after
the
eighth
hi
teammat
hold
the
opposit
scoreless
in
the
ninth
and
they
score
a
run
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
to
win
the
third
pitcher
earn
the
win
and
the
middl
reliev
get
no
stat
satisfact
thi
again
doesnt
support
your
claim
about
save
at
the
begin
of
