upon
the
return
to
the
game
two

last
out
to
first
pitch
or
a

call
dont
grant
time

more
than
enough
time
if
the
pitch
isnt
releas
in
call

around
i
think
that
steve
carlton
wa
pitch
on
the
other
hand
i
am
not
sure
how
much
effect
thi
would
have
it
seem
that
most
of
the
time
lost
is
when
there
are
