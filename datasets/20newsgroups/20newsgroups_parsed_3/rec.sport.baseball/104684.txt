subject
yanke
thought
ye
everyon
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
the
yanke
are
final
move
in
the
right
direct
they
should
finish
over
thi
year
and
mayb
even
be
in
the
pennent
race
in
august
howev
i
would
take
back
a
few
move
the
jim
abbott
trade
i
think
abbott
is
not
onli
an
inspir
person
but
a
great
pitcher
also
he
could
win
the
cy
young
thi
year
but
he
wont
becaus
the
right
side
of
the
yank
infield
isnt
good
enough
so
whi
wa
thi
not
a
good
trade
jt
snow
how
mani
rooki
have
been
abl
to
step
in
and
immedi
have
the
impact
that
he
ha
had
so
far
on
the
angel
i
know
it
earli
but
if
youv
seen
thi
kid
hit
field
or
talk
you
can
just
tell
that
he
is
go
to
be
a
tremend
player
the
yank
should
have
kept
him
what
about
mattingli
you
ask
well
it
great
that
the
yank
have
taken
care
of
him
and
remain
loyal
but
he
year
older
than
snow
and
just
doesnt
have
the
same
bat
speed
a
befor
hi
back
injuri
it
a
shame
but
a
a
yanke
fan
who
want
to
see
the
best
yanke
team
id
take
snow
over
mattingli
at
first
the
yank
also
gave
up
two
promis
propect
with
snow
for
abbott
besid
with
domingo
jean
brien
taylor
wickman
militello
and
sterl
hitchcock
they
are
just
load
with
propect
i
know
abbott
onli
but
thi
wa
too
much
to
give
up
i
believ
georg
forc
thi
trade
becaus
he
believ
and
he
right
that
abbott
will
be
a
big
hit
in
ny
howev
id
like
to
see
the
yanke
build
a
basebal
team
not
an
amus
show
wade
bogg
i
live
in
boston
and
like
wade
a
lot
but
hi
career
is
wind
down
and
i
would
rather
see
the
yank
start
to
develop
a
long
term
solut
ie
hensley
muelin
rus
davi
velard
besid
wade
just
doesnt
have
ani
rang
what
a
shame
about
charli
hay
huh
spike
owen
see
wade
bogg
id
much
rather
see
them
develop
dave
silvestri
or
whoever
wade
and
spike
next
to
each
other
in
the
infield
is
go
to
rais
the
yanke
staff
era
point
and
these
guy
are
on
the
down
side
of
their
career
danni
tartabul
ye
he
put
up
some
tremend
number
and
it
nice
to
think
about
what
he
could
do
if
he
were
ever
healthi
all
year
but
he
never
is
we
should
expect
game
max
out
of
him
meanwhil
gerald
william
is
play
at
columbu
and
paul
oneil
is
play
left
field
i
believ
oneil
led
nl
outfield
in
assist
last
year
and
tartabul
is
a
poor
defens
outfield
what
im
basic
get
at
is
the
yank
are
move
in
the
right
direct
but
are
not
readi
to
win
a
pennent
thi
year
they
should
at
the
gm
level
be
plan
for
a
or
world
seri
thi
mean
get
the
younger
player
experi
in
the
major
now
so
they
will
be
readi
in
a
year
or
two
im
afraid
that
all
thi
stuff
wreak
of
georg
steinbrenn
certainli
the
bogg
deal
wa
all
georg
it
look
like
georg
is
plan
the
right
mix
of
veteran
and
young
player
to
win
a
world
seri
now
the
veteran
are
alway
avail
and
can
be
ad
at
ani
time
like
boston
did
thi
year
develop
the
young
player
first
then
add
the
one
or
two
veteran
or
in
the
yanke
case
just
keep
them
let
all
u
yanke
fan
hope
that
georg
doesnt
dismantl
the
terrif
job
stick
and
compani
have
done
build
the
yanke
organ
back
into
one
of
respect
im
realli
afraid
that
he
will
trade
whoever
it
take
to
patch
hole
today
relief
pitch
for
exampl
georg
must
realiz
that
the
yanke
rebuild
process
is
still
one
or
two
year
away
have
patienc
georg
and
we
will
all
enjoy
the
futur
fire
bucki
and
trade
the
kid
and
it
basebal
hell
for
all
loyal
yanke
fan
for
a
long
time
sam
im
not
militello
or
millitello
mandelbaum
