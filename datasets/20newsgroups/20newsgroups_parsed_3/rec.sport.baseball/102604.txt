said
i
meant
that
one
should
not
let
the
except
make
the
rule
it
not
an
except
good
player
come
up
young
most
player
who
come
up
young
will
be
good
thi
ha
alway
been
the
rule
are
most
player
who
come
up
young
alway
good
when
theyr
young
or
later
wors
it
not
a
shift
thi
is
the
way
it
ha
alway
been
sever
detail
studi
of
thi
have
been
done
and
theyv
all
shown
that
player
arent
come
up
ani
younger
or
older
than
in
the
past
and
they
arent
play
ani
more
or
le
in
the
minor
than
they
use
to
the
onli
thing
that
shift
is
our
memori
of
the
good
old
day
damn
i
wa
afraid
you
would
say
that
but
all
after
the
fact
which
make
it
not
applic
to
the
current
discuss
which
is
about
how
you
decid
whether
to
play
the
rooki
who
hasnt
establish
himself
in
the
major
over
the
mediocr
veteran
the
padr
play
santiago
that
year
becaus
they
clearli
had
nobodi
els
worth
play
well
perhap
if
the
brave
had
no
one
els
worth
play
thi
year
it
would
be
lopez
in
there
but
they
do
have
other
worth
play
at
least
in
their
opinion
and
i
happen
to
agre
both
of
these
young
men
were
highli
tout
defens
catcher
expect
to
be
among
the
best
ever
in
basebal
not
by
recsportbasebal
consensu
that
may
sound
like
an
incred
arrog
comment
but
ive
found
that
the
sdcn
consensu
when
one
exist
is
right
far
more
often
than
the
medium
consensu
or
the
opinion
of
basebal
peopl
affili
with
mlb
i
can
believ
that
im
a
newbi
here
so
ill
take
your
word
but
alomar
is
a
fine
defens
catcher
which
wa
my
statement
abov
that
is
a
solid
reason
for
bring
him
up
at
a
tender
age
a
long
a
they
feel
he
can
also
hit
a
bit
lopez
doe
not
have
such
a
consensu
about
hi
defens
prowess
and
imho
that
is
enough
to
give
him
that
dread
season
i
dont
know
who
know
i
suppos
the
same
peopl
or
similar
who
know
he
will
be
better
than
some
other
catcher
these
are
of
cours
just
differ
opinion
i
read
that
hi
arm
is
not
that
strong
i
suppos
somewher
there
is
some
measur
of
sb
ratio
and
that
he
is
still
learn
to
call
a
game
that
latter
skill
may
be
difficult
to
project
on
someon
without
an
intim
knowledg
of
hi
perform
but
it
is
a
tangibl
skill
i
disagre
in
that
i
dont
think
it
is
a
tangibl
skill
ani
more
than
leadership
is
i
dont
deni
that
it
is
a
real
skill
and
that
some
catcher
may
be
much
better
than
other
at
it
but
i
realli
dont
see
ani
way
that
we
could
ever
know
who
they
are
nicholss
law
of
catcher
defens
is
eerili
accur
far
too
often
for
me
to
take
defens
assess
of
catcher
veri
serious
sorri
new
dont
know
nichol
law
dont
believ
in
catcher
era
but
i
am
interest
in
pitcher
era
with
differ
catcher
ani
info
on
that
absolut
the
evid
is
pile
up
year
after
year
the
onli
other
altern
is
that
the
brave
realli
dont
know
that
their
young
player
are
on
averag
better
than
their
current
starter
im
not
rule
out
that
kind
of
gross
incompet
but
i
think
the
salaryschedul
explan
is
more
charit
in
other
word
we
know
more
than
they
do
so
the
onli
logic
behind
a
differ
decis
than
we
would
make
must
be
financi
i
presum
we
feel
thi
way
about
other
franchis
than
atlanta
no
consid
we
know
that
the
brave
are
about
the
strongest
team
in
basebal
right
now
even
with
olson
and
lemk
and
nixon
and
bream
in
the
lineup
they
have
a
good
a
chanc
of
repeat
a
champ
thi
year
a
ani
team
ever
ha
it
actual
make
some
sens
to
say
rather
than
make
our
team
margin
better
thi
year
by
bring
up
the
young
stud
and
dump
the
elderli
let
go
ahead
and
compet
thi
year
with
what
we
have
and
then
bring
up
the
stud
onli
a
we
have
to
so
that
well
still
have
them
under
reserv
three
year
from
now
and
beyond
when
the
current
team
will
be
collect
pension
is
it
fair
to
the
young
player
no
doe
it
make
organiz
sens
i
think
it
doe
well
if
it
doe
make
organiz
sens
one
can
hardli
fault
them
for
their
decis
i
mean
pleas
dont
tell
me
how
to
run
my
busi
especi
when
im
be
success
c
i
could
make
it
or
win
if
you
let
me
bring
up
lopez
s
listen
bobbi
id
like
to
but
the
way
i
see
it
if
he
hit
the
big
club
thi
year
well
be
pay
megaarbitr
buck
down
the
road
in
a
coupl
of
year
and
there
no
way
i
want
to
do
that
and
continu
with
we
can
win
without
him
and
then
keep
win
next
year
with
him
how
that
im
sure
you
could
be
right
you
could
also
be
smoke
some
illeg
substanc
hey
that
a
joke
dont
get
offend
pleas
hey
id
love
to
be
wrong
about
thi
if
you
think
it
unlik
id
love
to
know
whi
dont
cite
anybodi
innat
ethic
rectitud
though
unless
you
know
them
person
well
i
cant
cite
anyon
ethic
rectitud
becaus
i
dont
know
what
it
mean
but
again
if
it
make
organiz
sens
then
so
be
it
basebal
is
a
busi
and
if
there
is
a
solid
busi
reason
for
keep
lopez
on
the
farm
then
that
what
the
brave
should
do
i
happen
to
believ
that
it
a
basebal
decis
while
you
from
your
armchair
may
disage
i
dont
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
evid
to
suggest
the
decis
they
made
i
predict
it
among
larg
guffaw
from
sever
at
the
start
of
spring
train
i
think
it
is
a
veri
normal
decis
to
have
made
it
is
certainli
more
revers
than
to
have
start
lopez
in
the
big
and
have
releas
one
of
their
catcher
sure
it
may
be
conserv
it
may
also
be
logic
i
dont
know
what
ethic
have
to
do
with
it
seem
like
pretti
good
common
sens
to
me
