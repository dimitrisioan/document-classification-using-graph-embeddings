all
of

blame
the
philli
success
on
a
weak
divis
whi
dont
we
look
at
the
record
of
the
team
in
each
divis
read
interdivision
play
well
see
that
the
east
is
realli
kick
the
shit
out
of
the
west
i
know
it
is
earli
but
that
is
all
we
have
to
go
on
atlanta
is
just
so
strong
with
their
ba
cincinnati
is
come
off
a
sweep
at
veteran

swept
in
it

way
too
earli
and
be
eat
your
word
by
midseason
cmon
the
philli
havent
prove

atlanta
wa
similar
to
the
phil
year
ago
they
suck
they
start
have
a
good
year
but
didnt
get
ani
respect
until
they
actual
won
the
divis

is
how
it
should
be
