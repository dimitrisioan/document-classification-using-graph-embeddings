subject
re
so
far
so
good
the
red
sox
wizard
write
i
have
post
two
new
post
on
the
net
sinc
i
discov
how
to
use
it
and
both
time
i
receiv
redicul
for
predict
the
red
sox
a
high
a
third
in
the
al
east
id
like
to
hear
whi
it
is
peopl
dont
think
the
sox
can
be
a
high
a
third
thi
year
here
are
some
of
my
observ
well
had
you
been
a
bit
le
exuber
in
both
the
tone
and
substanc
of
your
predict
the
respons
would
probabl
have
been
a
bit
more
measur
be
that
a
it
may
roger
and
frank
are
in
vintag
form
and
the
sox
are
rrespond
to
them
clemen
is
alway
in
thi
form
and
viola
isnt
realli
perform
beyond
what
might
reason
have
been
expect
how
do
you
know
that
the
sox
are
respond
to
them
and
not
to
al
bumbri
hobson
or
my
most
like
suspect
new
hit
coach
mike
easler
i
certainli
am
more
like
to
give
easler
credit
for
mo
vaughhn
hot
start
than
clemen
or
viola
greenwel
is
hit
a
he
did
befor
hi
injuri
thi
wa
the
optimist
scenario
but
not
unreason
so
he
hasnt
shown
much
power
yet
though
dawson
is
provid
the
leadership
and
some
hit
they
need
from
him
how
can
you
tell
that
dawson
is
provid
the
leadership
perhap
it
calderon
perhap
it
clemen
and
viola
mayb
hobson
is
final
show
those
peopl
skill
he
wa
suppos
to
have
when
they
hire
him
or
mayb
it
all
a
myth
and
dawson
ha
been
hit
reason
well
but
not
a
well
a
greenwel
vaughn
cooper
or
fletcher
russel
is
finish
well
in
three
game
whi
dont
we
look
at
thi
one
again
in
say
juli
fletcher
is
hit
well
a
a
leadoff
hitter
a
bit
better
than
could
reason
have
been
expect
but
dont
forget
that
zupcic
look
like
wade
bogg
lite
for
about
ab
last
year
bewar
of
small
sampl
size
still
if
fletcher
hit
a
well
a
he
did
last
year
hed
be
a
great
improv
over
ani
sox
leadoff
hitter
from
last
year
be
awar
that
hi
career
number
seem
to
indic
that
he
put
up
good
number
a
long
a
he
doesnt
have
to
make
more
than
ab
or
so
in
a
year
cooper
is
hit
well
i
think
hell
be
better
then
bogg
in
the
field
and
just
a
good
at
the
plate
ummmsorri
no
i
can
buy
the
in
the
field
part
and
i
think
hell
be
better
at
the
plate
than
the
bogg
but
in
gener
cooper
while
hell
be
a
pretti
good
hitter
couldnt
carri
bogg
jockstrap
with
a
littl
luck
he
could
be
the
fourth
or
fifth
best
b
in
the
al
martinez
bogg
ventura
and
palmer
will
all
be
better
if
the
sox
pitch
like
last
year
they
have
a
better
pitchiong
staff
now
and
hit
like
they
are
so
far
they
coiuld
run
away
with
thee
divis
but
sinc
i
think
that
their
hit
and
pitch
may
not
be
up
to
the
challeng
of
run
away
with
the
divis
i
think
that
they
win
be
over
and
at
least
third
if
not
second
or
first
see
here
is
where
you
make
that
quick
left
turn
off
into
the
aether
is
plausibl
third
is
not
unlik
but
phrase
like
could
run
away
with
the
divis
are
like
to
get
you
a
visit
from
the
men
in
the
white
coat
it
not
realli
clear
that
their
staff
is
better
than
last
year
if
russel
doe
well
darwin
doesnt
go
on
the
dl
and
hesketh
doesnt
pitch
just
bare
well
enough
to
avoid
lose
hi
spot
in
the
rotat
they
could
be
better
on
the
other
hand
if
hesketh
pitch
miser
and
theyr
too
stupid
to
move
him
to
the
pen
and
bring
up
conroy
or
somebodi
fossa
continu
to
pitch
dismal
but
they
keep
give
him
inning
becasu
he
a
lefti
and
russel
explod
they
could
be
pretti
bad
