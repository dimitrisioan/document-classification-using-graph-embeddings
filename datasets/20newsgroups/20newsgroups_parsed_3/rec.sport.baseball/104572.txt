joe
torr
ha
to
be
the
worst
manag
in
basebal
for
anyon
who
didnt
see
sunday
game
with
a
right
hander
pitch
he
decid
to
bench
lankform
a
left
hand
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
hander
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
base
load
and
two
out
he
put
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
a
a
pinch
runner
and
us
lui
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
a
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
think
for
your
inform
lankford
is
injur
i
think
it
is
hi
shoulder
or
rib
cage
so
he
could
not
use
him
a
a
pinch
hitter
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquir
mark
whiten
he
comment
how
fortun
the
cardin
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
thi
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torr
said
he
like
gilkey
come
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
doe
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
start
on
most
everi
team
in
the
leagu
i
do
believ
that
whiten
wa
a
veri
good
aquisit
for
the
card
he
doe
not
have
too
much
offens
capabl
but
he
is
an
awesom
defens
sinc
when
have
the
cardnial
actual
thought
of
offens
instead
of
defens
i
forgot
who
st
loui
gave
up
for
him
but
it
wa
not
too
much
a
far
a
gilkey
is
concern
he
is
a
leftfield
and
so
is
brian
jordan
who
beat
him
out
i
expect
to
see
a
gilkeyjordan
platoon
in
lf
furthermor
in
sunday
game
when
lankford
wa
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
show
bucki
dent
the
third
base
coach
look
down
the
line
and
wave
lankford
home
i
agre
with
you
on
thi
one
a
soon
a
larkin
threw
that
ball
i
knew
that
lankford
wa
a
dead
bird
but
how
could
dent
have
known
that
larkin
would
make
a
perfect
throw
i
strongli
believ
that
torr
is
one
of
the
best
manag
in
basebal
dont
forget
the
overachiev
card
of
that
won
all
those
close
game
and
went
from
last
place
to
second
place
although
they
were
oveshadow
by
the
brave
twin
last
to
first
climb
he
won
a
divis
titl
and
bare
lost
a
pennant
race
when
he
wa
with
the
brave
whi
atlanta
ever
even
consid
fire
him
i
will
never
understand
with
torr
at
the
control
the
cardin
are
head
in
the
right
direct
one
more
thing
one
game
doe
not
make
a
season
ye
they
lost
to
the
red
but
with
the
second
best
pitch
staff
in
the
nation
leagu
first
in
the
east
and
a
pretti
good
offens
the
redbird
will
win
a
lot
more
than
they
lose
mayb
thi
is
the
year
that
they
will
go
all
the
