thi
is
what
jackson
look
like
in
with
everyth
convert
to
a
neutral
park
on
the
basi
of
run
product
hi
equival
averag
start
at
in
wa
up
to
in
and
in
so
let
u
say
he
had
establish
in
hi
last
two
season
a
level
of
play
im
not
quit
sure
how
these
number
are
gener
it
appear
that
in
a
neutral
park
bo
hr
and
slug
tend
to
drop
he
actual
lose
two
home
run
or
do
they
what
is
equival
averag
one
thing
when
look
at
bo
stat
is
that
you
can
see
that
kc
took
away
some
homer
normal
you
expect
some
wouldb
homer
to
go
for
doubl
or
tripl
in
big
park
or
to
be
caught
and
for
that
matter
you
expect
lot
of
doubl
and
tripl
anyway
but
bo
despit
hi
speed
hit
veri
few
doubl
and
not
that
mani
tripl
so
i
would
expect
hi
valu
to
have
risen
quit
consider
in
a
neutral
park
that
is
good
veri
good
in
fact
but
it
probabl
doesnt
make
the
top
ten
in
the
leagu
the
th
best
eqa
in
the
al
in
wa
dave
winfield
thoma
wa
first
at
first
in
the
nl
wa
bond
an
incroy
tenth
wa
bip
robert
but
is
better
than
ani
season
in
the
past
five
year
by
joe
carter
it
is
about
what
mattingli
had
in
what
felix
jose
had
the
last
two
year
just
ahead
of
time
rain
fiveyear
averag
better
than
ryan
klesko
mle
felix
jose
ha
been
a
player
in
a
fairli
neutral
park
i
would
offhand
guess
the
bo
at
around
a
player
mayb
not
even
close
he
got
more
attent
from
the
medium
than
wa
warrant
from
hi
basebal
play
though
hi
hype
wa
a
lot
better
than
hi
hit
that
is
the
basi
for
the
netcom
about
him
be
overr
the
medium
would
have
you
beleiv
he
wa
a
great
hitter
i
think
he
wa
a
good
mayb
veri
good
hitter
he
wa
imo
someth
like
the
th
best
hitter
in
the
major
id
put
him
about
there
too
note
i
hadnt
realiz
the
medium
had
hype
him
so
much
i
thought
he
wa
alway
view
by
them
a
a
better
footbal
player
and
onli
soso
at
basebal
he
did
onli
have
one
hr
rbi
season
and
kc
wasnt
win
note
i
mayb
have
harp
on
thi
a
bit
in
the
past
but
there
is
a
mistak
be
made
by
the
sdcn
a
they
are
known
on
thi
group
with
respect
to
player
like
bo
and
deion
and
lofton
and
perhap
other
we
find
that
if
you
look
at
a
larg
group
of
player
their
past
major
and
minor
leagu
number
will
predict
their
futur
number
fairli
well
their
are
some
caveat
the
younger
they
are
the
le
good
the
predict
the
lower
the
minor
leagu
the
le
good
i
imagin
the
more
recent
the
player
ha
left
colleg
ball
etc
now
of
cours
thi
predict
involv
quit
a
bit
of
error
sometim
a
player
with
poor
mle
dave
justic
the
ventura
becom
a
star
some
hitter
develop
shane
mack
brian
down
some
dont
oddib
mcdowel
mickey
brantley
thi
error
involv
real
thing
there
are
real
reason
whi
oddib
didnt
hit
and
shane
did
it
may
who
know
involv
park
and
bat
coach
and
wheati
and
injuri
and
lift
and
so
on
but
still
you
have
thi
big
pool
of
player
and
thing
work
pretti
well
one
of
the
reason
for
these
predict
accuraci
is
the
common
background
of
the
player
one
thing
we
know
about
profession
basebal
player
is
that
all
of
them
or
almost
all
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
play
ball
their
background
are
similar
what
hasnt
been
establish
is
what
happen
when
you
encount
a
player
with
a
differ
background
is
there
some
reason
to
believ
that
a
bo
or
a
deion
or
a
lofton
or
a
toni
gwynn
or
an
aing
or
so
on
ha
such
a
differ
background
that
the
standard
model
and
standard
assumpt
fit
thi
person
slowli
it
hasnt
been
establish
that
you
can
use
mle
with
twosport
player
it
hasnt
been
establish
that
you
cant
but
then
statist
is
after
all
an
art
i
person
think
otherwis
lucid
individu
continu
make
complet
nonsens
statement
about
bo
and
deion
and
lofton
look
at
those
goodbutnotgreat
minor
leagu
number
they
say
well
what
happen
if
those
number
simpli
dont
mean
what
they
usual
mean
it
might
mean
that
ken
lofton
suddenli
ha
a
better
year
in
houston
than
tuscon
it
might
mean
that
deion
suddenli
ha
a
better
halfyear
in
atlanta
than
greenvil
then
again
it
might
not
ken
and
deion
might
go
right
back
in
the
tank
thi
year
live
up
to
those
poor
mle
but
you
guy
dont
know
what
wors
you
dont
know
that
you
dont
and
you
dont
know
that
there
are
other
player
you
wont
know
about
injuri
and
lift
and
wheati
again
you
seem
to
think
that
the
model
is
perfect
and
etern
it
not
it
got
some
error
oh
well
bill
guilford
still
think
hairi
butt
is
truli
ugli
might
be
right
