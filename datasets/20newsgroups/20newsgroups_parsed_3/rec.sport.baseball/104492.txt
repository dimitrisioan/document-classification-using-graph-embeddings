into
thi
in
articl
austin

write
dont
you
guy
think
so
i
mean
cmon
what
the
heck
are
woman
do
even
think
of
get
into
basebal
they
caus
so
mani
problem
just
assum
your
seriou
i
guess
youd
be
surpris
to
hear
that
u
guy
dont
think
so
i
would
guess
that
a
tini
fraction
of
of
the
folk
read
your
post
agre
with
it
i
kind
of
doubt
that
even
you
agre
with
it
im
not
go
to
go
through
your
point
one
at
a
time
becaus
after
all
not
mani
of
them
have
anyth
at
all
to
do
with
basebal
im
onli
repli
to
thi
becaus
you
brought
up
pam
postema
the
aaa
umpir
who
su
is
su
basebal
on
the
ground
of
sex
discrimin
becaus
she
wasnt
promot
to
the
major
jeez
look
at
pam
postema
just
becaus
she
a
woman
everybodi
on
the
face
of
the
earth
think
it
great
that
she
get
an
opportun
to
ump
if
you
even
watch
the
game
and
had
an
iq
greater
than
that
of
roast
beef
youd
see
that
she
is
not
nearli
a
good
a
most
aaa
umpir
ive
never
seen
her
ump
a
game
i
have
no
first
hand
experi
with
her
abil
a
an
umpir
but
i
have
seen
her
on
talk
show
and
her
point
seem
to
be
that
she
can
call
ball
and
strike
a
well
a
ani
of
the
umpir
and
she
know
the
rulebook
better
than
most
it
seem
to
me
that
she
is
miss
the
point
and
if
that
how
she
see
the
role
of
umpir
in
the
game
well
i
wouldnt
promot
her
either
the
umpir
primari
role
ha
noth
to
do
with
call
baserunn
safe
or
out
hell
joe
lundi
could
do
that
their
primari
function
is
to
maintain
order
in
the
game
keep
the
game
move
and
keep
the
player
from
tri
to
kill
each
other
umpir
have
to
be
extrem
tough
peopl
that
disqualifi
most
of
u
both
men
and
woman
and
if
m
postema
think
that
she
deserv
to
be
a
major
leagu
umpir
becaus
of
her
command
of
the
rulebook
then
i
think
that
disqualifi
her
a
well
umpir
need
to
command
the
game
command
of
the
rulebook
is
secondari
dave
eisen
to
succeed
in
the

it
is
not
enough
to
be
stupid
