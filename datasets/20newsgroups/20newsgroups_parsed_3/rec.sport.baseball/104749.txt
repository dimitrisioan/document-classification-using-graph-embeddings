you

up
ballgam
mandat
a
rule
permit
onli
n
second
between
pitch
the
current
rule
is
too
lenient
and
then
enforc
it
fifteen
second
is
more
plea
pardon
my
ignor
if
thi
is
well
known
but
what
is
the
current
rule
than
enough
time
if
the
pitch
isnt
releas
in
call
it
a
ball
and
restart
the
clock
i
rememb
a
post
from
last
year
indic
that
a
pitch
clock
wa
tri
in
one
of
the
minor
leagu
some
time
back
and
did
not
work
i
dont
rememb
whi
they
said
that
it
did
not
work
anyon
rememb
thi
jodi
mcdonnel
on
wip
in
phil
ha
been
say
that
a
pitch
clock
wa
inevit
how
would
a
pitch
clock
work
on
throw
to
first
mayb
we
could
limit
the
number
of
throw
to
first
that
the
pitcher
can
make
and
award
a
balk
if
he
exce
it
id
have
anoth
question
who
would
oper
the
pitch
clock
one
of
the
umpir
add
anoth
one
to
the
crew
anoth
pair
of
suggest
remov
the
balk
rule
it
is
the
runner
respons
to
stay
safe
no
matter
what
the
pitcher
doe
im
not
sure
i
like
thi
idea
i
think
it
would
sever
diminish
the
number
of
stolen
base
and
limit
the
avail
of
such
neat
strateg
ploy
a
the
hit
and
run
and
the
squeez
play
one
of
my
person
favorit
if
a
pitcher
throw
to
an
occupi
base
more
than
x
time
x
to
without
success
pick
off
the
runner
the
runner
advanc
a
base
a
if
walk
ahhh
i
suppos
i
should
read
the
whole
articl
befor
i
hit
the
f
key
eh
obvious
from
what
i
wrote
abov
i
like
thi
idea
the
nobalk
seem
to
give
the
pitcher
the
advantag
the
basewalk
allow
the
runner
to
challeng
pitcher
to
throw
over
to
the
base
it
may
also
increas
the
number
of
wild
throw
to
the
bag
sinc
the
pitcher
know
he
doesnt
have
veri
mani
chanc
to
pick
off
the
runner
so
he
may
hurri
too
much
id
rather
see
run
score
a
the
result
of
sound
hit
and
sound
basebal
strategi
rather
than
on
the
sloppi
that
could
result
from
thi
kind
of
rule
so
i
suppos
there
are
some
disadvantag
to
that
idea
too
basebal
game
take
about
in
the
nl
and
just
a
shade
under
hour
in
the
al
that
just
too
damn
long
i
dont
like
to
play
in
hour
game
much
le
watch
a
game
for
that
long
my
butt
fall
asleep
and
if
im
watch
on
tv
ill
channel
surf
between
pitch
catch
color
version
of
mr
ed
leav
it
to
beaver
and
those
wacki
niepor
on
nick
at
nite
i
too
find
myself
surf
when
i
know
that
it
will
be
enough
time
between
each
pitch
to
allow
the
batter
to
adjust
hi
jewleri
i
rememb
in
littl
leagu
if
when
up
to
bat
we
step
out
of
the
batter
box
even
for
a
moment
we
were
automat
out
that
may
be
a
littl
harsh
for
the
major
but
serious
how
about
put
a
limit
on
the
batter
be
abl
to
step
out
take
sever
dozen
practic
swing
pound
their
shoe
scratch
their
ball
etc
mayb
forc
them
to
stay
in
the
batter
box
wouldnt
be
such
a
bad
idea
that
could
save
a
few
minut
randi
