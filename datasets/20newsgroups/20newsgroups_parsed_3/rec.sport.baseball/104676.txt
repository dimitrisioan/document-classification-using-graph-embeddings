hey
valentin
i
dont
see
boston
with
ani
world
seri
ring
on
their
finger
yah
so
damn
morri
now
ha
three
and
probabl
the
hall
of
fame
in
hi
futur
he
certainli
didnt
earn
hi
last
one
how
mani
game
did
he
blow
in
the
world
seri
all
of
the
one
he
start
he
certainli
did
earn
it
he
wa
a
valuabl
member
of
the
blue
jay
team
not
particularli
in
the
world
seri
dure
the
season
he
wa
probabl
more
valuabl
than
say
put
olerud
out
there
to
pitch
but
yeah
he
wa
valuabl
in
get
them
there
in
the
postseason
he
suck
dirti
canal
water
through
a
straw
the
jay
won
in
spite
of
morri
much
more
than
becaus
of
him
therefor
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easili
made
the
best
sign
oh
ye
definit
therefor
morri
is
better
than
clemen
your
definit
of
better
refer
to
some
measur
on
a
scale
that
ha
noth
to
do
with
win
w
ring
umm
roger
return
with
u
to
those
halcyon
day
of
a
few
post
ago
where
the
poster
valentin
wa
repli
to
use
of
w
ring
a
a
measur
of
better
the
concept
is
call
context
and
you
should
realli
becom
familiar
with
it
someday
the
fact
are
that
morri
ha
shown
u
that
he
ha
what
it
take
to
play
on
a
w
win
club
clemen
hasnt
unless
thi
transalt
to
clemen
hasnt
gone
into
lou
gorman
offic
with
a
larg
calib
handgun
and
refus
to
come
out
until
hed
been
trade
to
the
jay
im
at
a
complet
loss
a
to
ani
possibl
mean
for
it
you
can
go
on
about
what
clemen
ha
done
in
the
past
and
claim
that
he
is
better
than
morri
if
you
want
to
but
the
fact
are
that
morri
ha
shown
u
that
he
can
win
and
clemen
hasnt
what
on
earth
doe
thi
mean
over
their
career
clemen
ha
won
of
the
game
he
start
morri
per
year
clemen
ha
averag
nearli
win
morri
just
under
would
you
grant
the
proposit
that
prevent
the
other
team
from
score
increas
your
chanc
of
win
a
game
if
so
then
consid
that
clemen
allow
run
inning
pitch
morri
allow
nearli
a
run
more
per
nine
inning
in
fact
jack
morri
ha
never
in
hi
career
had
an
era
for
a
singl
year
a
good
a
clemen
career
era
but
i
forget
in
the
maynardvers
there
wa
obvious
some
mystic
signific
to
buckner
miss
that
grounder
in
had
morri
been
on
the
sox
it
would
have
been
a
routin
groundout
right
whether
or
not
clemen
is
better
by
your
standard
of
measur
is
total
meaningless
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
compil
high
figur
in
statist
that
you
have
chosen
to
feel
are
import
the
object
of
the
game
is
to
contribut
to
w
victori
but
thi
ha
been
patient
explain
to
you
mani
mani
time
and
you
are
either
too
stupid
or
too
stubborn
to
grasp
it
speak
of
stupid
it
ha
been
patient
and
notsopati
explain
to
you
mani
time
that
attribut
great
to
player
base
on
the
accomplish
of
their
team
make
about
a
much
sens
a
claim
that
a
racecar
ha
the
most
attract
paint
job
becaus
it
won
the
race
your
continu
failur
to
not
onli
understand
but
even
to
intellig
repli
to
ani
of
the
argument
present
lead
me
to
the
conclus
that
you
must
have
spent
a
few
too
mani
game
in
goal
without
a
mask
dont
give
me
that
shit
if
boston
had
alomar
olerud
henk
and
ward
while
toronto
had
rivera
jack
clark
jeff
reardon
thing
would
have
look
a
littl
differ
last
fall
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
thi
lavish
of
prais
on
morri
make
me
sick
ye
and
the
dog
would
have
caught
the
rabbit
tooforget
about
what
didnt
happen
and
open
your
eye
for
onc
and
look
out
there
and
see
what
is
realli
happen
forget
about
how
morri
shouldnt
have
won
with
an
era
over
when
morri
pitch
last
year
the
jay
won
stop
cri
about
it
and
get
on
with
life
no
one
is
cri
the
jay
won
and
a
a
team
they
certainli
deserv
to
win
at
least
the
al
east
they
perform
well
in
two
short
seri
and
won
the
world
seri
and
i
congratul
them
for
it
a
a
red
sox
fan
i
hope
they
keep
morri
i
wa
happi
when
they
pick
up
stewart
and
elat
when
they
trade
for
darrin
jackson
you
see
unless
you
believ
in
some
mystic
link
between
morri
and
the
offens
you
can
hardli
help
but
believ
that
the
man
wa
credit
with
so
mani
win
last
year
becaus
he
got
lucki
luck
run
out
just
like
it
did
in
when
he
pitch
odd
more
inning
than
gave
up
exactli
one
earn
run
more
than
in
and
went
serious
roger
id
realli
like
to
hear
your
explan
of
the
differ
between
the
morri
and
the
morri
which
one
wa
a
better
pitcher
and
whi
did
morri
somehow
learn
how
to
win
in
the
interven
ten
year
if
so
then
whi
did
he
go
in
with
minnesota
with
an
era
over
half
a
run
lower
than
mike
jone
aix
highend
develop
dont
be
humbl
your
not
that
great
