steven

write
stuff
delet
mattingli
score
badli
on
both
count
he
doesnt
get
to
veri
mani
ball
and
he
let
a
lot
of
ball
go
through
the
fact
that
he
look
smooth
ha
great
hand
and
make
few
error
mean
noth
thi
is
tradit
brainless
relianc
on
observ
that
can
easili
be
misl
like
a
lot
of
bad
fielder
mattingli
actual
make
himself
look
better
by
not
have
ani
rang
he
nowher
near
a
bad
a
steve
garvey
but
that
not
much
of
a
compliment
i
agre
with
the
flavor
of
thi
post
but
disagre
with
one
specif
argument
that
ha
great
hand
mean
noth
it
seem
to
me
that
a
firstbaseman
defens
valu
is
not
entir
or
even
primarili
from
hi
abil
to
field
grounder
or
catch
popup
how
mani
such
chanc
doe
he
get
dure
a
game
mani
fewer
than
he
get
chanc
to
catch
throw
from
bssb
and
p
i
mean
the
total
of
these
is
much
higher
than
grounderpopup
total
thi
impli
to
me
that
there
is
valu
in
catch
these
throw
well
even
if
they
are
high
upthelin
or
in
the
dirt
good
hand
are
need
for
such
play
and
thu
have
valu
i
dont
have
ani
number
for
the
rel
number
of
occur
of
these
play
but
id
guess
that
the
valu
of
these
abil
are
similar
it
just
like
you
dont
judg
catcher
defens
primarili
on
how
they
field
bunt
and
popup
but
not
a
mark
