he
left
hirschbeck
no
choic
but
to
take
control
of
the
situat
the
bottom
line
is
gant
start
a
danger
power
struggl
with
hirschbeck
when
hi
team
need
him
most
and
he
lost
the
event
i
saw
were

or
did
it
look
like
hirschbeck
point
to
the

after
hirschbeck
call
for
the

but
befor
the
pitch
wa
thrown
cox
came
onto
the
field
it
wa
obviou
that
he
wa
tri
to
get
time
call
befor
the

but
no
one
wa

is
call
a

argu
couldnt

player
everywher

final
resum
gant
shouldnt
have
ignor
hirschbeck
not
return
made
the
strike
call
fairli
like
although
i
suspect
an
argument
might
have
gotten
gant
toss
altogeth
but
if
hirschbeck
had
let
gant
step
out
the
whole
incid
probabl
would
have
been
avoid
your
list
pretti
much
agre
with
what
i
saw
with
the
aforement
addendum
perhap
it
appear
differ
at
the
ballpark
person
i
wa
amaz
that
gant
didnt
get
eject
but
that
whi
cox
did
it
call
protect
your
player
and
to
those
peopl
who
would
have
thrown
everyon
out
of
the
game
all
i
can
say
is
that
youd
be
make
basebal
histori
even
in
the
worst
basebal
brawl
usual
onli
the
major
instig
are
eject
not
everyon
who
come
onto
the
field
and
id
have
to
say
that
those
brawl
are
consider
more
threaten
to
the
game
than
what
the
brave
did
fri
night
anyhow
that
my
last
two
cent
on
the
subject
bar
outrag
post
i
will
tri
to
keep
my
eye
open
for
more
incid
involv
hirschbeck
i
think
there
will
be
some
with
other
team
a
well
i
hope
not
