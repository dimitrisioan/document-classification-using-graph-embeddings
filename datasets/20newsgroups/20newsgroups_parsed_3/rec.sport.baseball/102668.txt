re
young
catcher
mark
singer
said
we
know
that
veri
veri
few
player
at
thi
age
make
much
of
an
impact
in
the
big
especi
when
they
havent
even
play
aaa
ball
ye
but
thi
is
irrelev
your
talk
about
averag
when
we
have
lot
of
inform
about
thi
player
in
particular
to
base
our
decis
on
i
might
a
well
say
we
know
that
veri
veri
few
peopl
are
more
than
foot
tall
so
chanc
are
that
manut
bol
is
realli
onli
foot
no
mayb
i
need
to
improv
my
write
skill
lopez
who
is
veri
ordinari
defens
is
not
like
to
hit
so
well
at
age
have
not
play
at
aaa
level
that
it
is
probabl
not
a
good
idea
to
rush
him
into
the
brave
lineup
in
whi
isnt
lopez
like
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjust
hi
stat
for
park
and
leagu
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolut
scale
than
olson
or
berryhil
did
by
a
lot
a
for
rush
if
there
realli
is
a
qualit
differ
between
the
minor
and
the
major
that
requir
a
period
of
adjust
and
i
dont
believ
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
wast
lopez
year
old
good
season
than
hi
year
old
veri
good
season
or
hi
yearold
excel
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclim
the
more
of
hi
prime
you
get
to
use
lopez
wa
hit
over
ab
when
he
wa
cut
from
spring
train
what
doe
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chanc
mayb
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
coupl
start
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
hi
worth
gee
i
dont
know
ab
sound
pretti
good
to
me
about
a
good
a
your
reason
that
the
kid
should
play
a
backup
role
rather
than
start
everi
day
at
aaa
talk
about
me
a
a
gm
the
point
wa
not
that
ab
is
a
signific
sampl
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anyth
in
spring
train
to
caus
even
a
blockhead
manag
to
question
whether
hi
minor
leagu
number
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
get
warm
up
ok
most
player
are
not
readi
for
the
big
at
age
most
player
are
never
readi
for
the
big
what
doe
thi
have
to
do
with
javi
lopez
most
player
benefit
rather
than
be
stagnant
or
hurt
by
play
at
aaa
see
abov
most
catcher
need
to
be
solid
defens
player
to
help
their
club
in
the
big
those
are
the
argument
against
lopez
for
the
brave
for
thi
year
but
i
could
appli
the
same
reason
to
frank
thoma
or
barri
bond
most
player
arent
that
good
so
they
probabl
wont
be
that
good
thi
year
either
now
the
brave
have
two
catcher
who
have
demonstr
solid
abil
to
call
game
to
work
with
the
pitcher
to
throw
out
runner
and
demonstr
inabl
to
hit
their
way
out
of
a
soap
bubbl
not
superstar
mind
you
but
solid
experienc
veteran
not
superstar
not
star
not
even
good
player
mayb
averag
if
were
be
charit
the
brave
have
a
veri
solid
lineup
with
two
big
bat
in
the
outfield
an
excel
platoon
at
first
a
solid
mvp
candid
at
third
and
one
of
the
better
hit
shortstop
ummm
justic
is
a
veri
fine
hitter
pendleton
might
have
anoth
big
year
in
hi
bat
but
he
might
also
spend
the
season
in
hamstr
hell
gant
is
a
big
question
mark
the
breamhunt
platoon
is
decent
not
excel
and
ha
rotten
obp
or
slg
depend
on
who
in
blauser
is
a
veri
valuabl
bat
for
a
shortstop
the
center
field
platoon
will
probabl
hit
howev
good
lopez
bat
might
be
given
the
abov
it
wont
be
so
much
better
than
what
they
have
to
offset
the
differenti
in
experi
and
defens
abil
wan
na
bet
the
differ
between
lopez
bat
and
olsonberryhil
could
be
or
run
over
the
cours
of
the
season
given
a
choic
between
a
player
with
experi
and
a
player
who
can
play
ill
take
the
latter
everi
time
the
kid
will
improv
play
at
aaa
just
like
keith
mitchel
did
i
am
just
so
surpris
i
have
to
spell
all
of
thi
out
my
good
do
you
believ
the
other
poster
who
think
lopez
is
be
held
down
becaus
of
hi
futur
earn
potenti
that
wa
me
and
you
so
far
your
onli
counterpropos
is
that
they
realli
dont
understand
how
good
lopez
is
or
overvalu
experi
or
some
combin
of
the
two
i
think
my
interpret
wa
more
flatter
to
the
organ
are
they
idiot
who
have
built
thi
ballclub
wellargu
