the
walk
should
give
it
away
obp
in
gener
somewhat
more
valuabl
than
slug
and
alomar
edg
in
obp
wa
quit
a
bit
larger
than
baerga
edg
in
slug
im
no
sdcn
but
what
more
valuabl
hit
w
more
doubl
more
hr
or
more
tripl
and
bb
let
not
forget
the
extra
sb
how
mani
c
alomar
had
c
baerga
had
dont
forget
the
more
out
baerga
had
hi
gidp
balanc
out
hi
c
and
he
had
one
more
sacrific
than
alomar
a
replac
level
second
baseman
could
have
had
hit
walk
and
a
coupl
of
xbh
for
the
addit
out
baerga
had
a
tripl
is
littl
differ
than
a
home
run
were
talk
exchang
almost
walk
for
six
or
seven
home
run
and
four
doubl
i
would
say
the
almost
walk
are
more
valuabl
also
alomar
got
a
far
greater
boost
from
hi
home
park
than
baerga
did
from
hi
and
six
or
seven
home
run
hmm
so
if
you
want
to
pick
a
second
baseman
to
play
in
toronto
youd
take
alomar
anywher
els
and
youd
probabl
take
baerga
mike
disclaim
