credit
a
long
a
the

get
more
run
if
a
player
help
the
team
get
more
r
and
rbi
but
doesnt
score
them
all
himself
who
care
amus
isnt
it
seem
onli
the
sdcn
realiz
how
much
basebal
is
a
team
game
combin
effort
from
everi
player
for
the
win
consid
the
red
sox
game
last
night
the
sox
won
in
the
bottom
of
the
th
who
won
the
game
clemen
pitch
a
strong
nine
inning
allow
onli
two
run
ryan
pitch
a
coupl
shutout
inning
though
he
need
some
excel
defens
play
behind
him
to
do
so
quantril
pitch
a
coupl
of
inning
gave
up
the
goahead
run
and
got
credit
with
the
win
when
the
sox
score
two
in
the
bottom
of
the
inning
look
like
a
team
effort
to
me
yet
onli
quantril
got
credit
for
the
win
how
about
the
offens
dawson
and
vaughn
hit
i
think
hr
earli
in
the
game
without
either
one
the
sox
would
have
lost
in
nine
quintana
led
off
the
th
with
a
solid
singl
zupcic
pinchran
for
quintana
provid
the
speed
to
go
from
first
to
third
when
cooper
rip
a
second
singl
in
the
inning
melvin
avoid
the
dp
get
the
run
home
with
a
sac
fli
not
much
of
a
help
but
it
wa
someth
scrub
richardson
then
hit
a
doubl
score
the
speedi
cooper
all
the
way
from
first
hill
lack
of
defens
help
cooper
and
zupcic
were
credit
with
run
melvin
and
richardson
were
credit
with
rbi
but
it
seem
to
me
that
it
wa
quintana
hit
that
set
up
the
whole
inning
and
did
melvin
realli
contribut
a
much
a
richardson
furthermor
peopl
seem
to
consid
rbi
to
be
more
signific
than
run
did
melvin
contribut
more
than
cooper
cooper
provid
the
gamewin
baserunn
and
move
the
tie
run
to
third
base
with
onli
one
out
assign
credit
base
on
run
and
rbi
is
clearli
ridicul
you
can
argu
that
obp
and
slg
dont
show
you
who
came
through
in
the
clutch
but
rrbi
dont
do
ani
better
at
least
obp
and
slg
dont
claim
to
tri
to
tell
you
that
here
to
the
red
sox
who
contribut
to
last
night
victori
all
of
them
