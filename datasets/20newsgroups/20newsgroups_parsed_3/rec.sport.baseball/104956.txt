perform
certainli
happen
everi

there
is
a
gamewin
hit
the
clutch
pitch
quot
abov
is
someth
which
happen
not
a
claim
that
ani
particular
player
should
be
expect
to
be
a
clutch
pitcher
over
the
past
four
season
sabo
ha
had
hit
in
ab
defin
a
clutch
situat
by
the
scout
report
for
an
averag
of
over
that
same
period
he
had
anoth
ab
with
hit
for
an
averag
of
accord
to
the
rest
of
the
sdcn
ani
differenti
such
a
thi
is
complet
and
total
random
and
can
not
be
use
for
ani
reason
infer
such
a
perhap
perez
should
have
use
a
pinch
hitter
in
that
situat
simpl
statist
tell
me
that
there
is
a
chanc
an
averag
clutch
hitter
would
have
thi
larg
a
split
the
averag
decreas
is
point
standard
deviat
about
there
will
be
such
hitter
in
ani
leagu
just
a
there
will
be
hitter
who
hit
poorli
on
tuesday
and
there
is
onli
a
veri
weak
correl
in
my
best
studi
between
clutch
hit
in
the
last
four
year
and
clutch
hit
thi
year
probabl
becaus
most
of
the
clutch
data
is
determina
by
luck
rather
than
ani
abil
base
onli
on
thi
data
i
dont
see
ani
reason
to
pinchhit
for
sabo
or
ani
other
player
who
had
been
a
poor
clutch
hitter
in
the
past
but
there
are
mani
other
factor
involv
in
a
decis
to
pinchhit
doe
the
pinchhitt
give
you
a
platoon
advantag
ani
portion
of
sabo
clutch
split
that
result
from
hi
platoon
split
is
certainli
a
real
abil
even
if
it
ha
noth
to
do
with
clutch
hit
do
you
have
a
singl
hitter
at
the
plate
when
you
need
a
home
run
do
you
have
a
curvebal
pitcher
face
a
batter
who
ha
troubl
with
curv
david
grabin
we
are
sorri
but
the
number
you
have
dial
is
imaginari
pleas
rotat
your
