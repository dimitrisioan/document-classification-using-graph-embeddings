a
popular
player
in
san
diego
derek
bell
wa
not
fare
well
in
the
clubhous
at
toronto
so
no
matter
how
bad
he
look
now
i
still
think
it
wa
a
steal
for
the
jay
just
from
the
perspect
of
team
chemistri
i
laugh
at
you
now
and
i
will
laugh
at
you
again
equal
publicli
when
the
jay
finish
third
due
to
the
sever
deplet
of
their
talent
the
jay
will
finish
third
becaus
of
the
deplet
of
their
pitch
staff
not
becaus
derek
bell
wa
trade
for
darrin
jakson
i
couldnt
agre
more
the
jay
have
a
lot
of
power
in
their
lineup
so
far
pitch
ha
been
the
biggest
problem
mayb
we
can
get
acker
back
but
anyway
the
point
of
my
post
if
you
miss
it
wa
that
derek
bell
wa
trade
becaus
he
wa
basic
in
the
doghous
with
cito
and
the
rest
of
the
team
one
incid
that
stick
out
in
my
mind
wa
when
derek
bell
ran
back
out
on
to
the
feild
after
the
jay
had
won
the
divis
and
all
the
player
were
back
in
the
clubhous
bell
ran
around
the
field
with
hi
arm
in
the
air
wave
a
big
towel
over
hi
head
he
look
like
a
big
jerk
especi
when
you
consid
he
did
not
contribut
much
to
the
team
over
the
whole
season
the
next
day
winfield
and
carter
somehow
got
the
key
to
bell
jeep
and
brought
it
out
on
to
the
feild
befor
the
game
start
the
stadium
announc
said
that
there
wa
go
to
be
a
draw
later
in
the
game
for
bell
jeep
bell
realli
freak
out
i
dont
think
bell
wa
to
popular
after
that
i
think
that
jackson
might
be
tri
a
littl
too
hard
right
now
he
known
for
be
a
great
outfield
and
he
not
the
onli
