jump
on

let
me
ask
the
net
would
the
jay
have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morri
given
hi
run
support
how
about
an
averag
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believ
that
morri
perform
in
the
playoff
and
seri
had
a
larg
posit
impact
on
the
jay
perform
i
know
it
veri
trendi
nowaday
to
dump
on
morri
but
let
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubt
that
the
blue
jay
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morri
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starter
were
be
shell
and
milwauke
wa
make
a
charg
morri
went
with
a
pretti
good
era
i
cant
rememb
exactli
also
let
not
underestim
the
import
hi
inning
to
save
the
bullpen
everi
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
u
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
seri
hi
run
support
wa
high
run
but
so
wa
stottlemy
run
and
he
won
onli
game
i
do
rememb
morri
win
an
inordin
number
of
and
ballgam
but
thi
is
to
hi
credit
he
pitch
onli
a
good
a
he
need
to
be
when
he
wa
up
in
a
ballgam
he
just
put
it
in
cruis
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batter
get
themselev
out
i
hate
thi
express
an
inexperienc
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
tri
to
make
perfect
pitch
to
keep
hi
era
down
but
morri
be
a
veteran
pitcher
know
that
win
is
the
onli
thing
that
realli
matter
in
basebal
by
save
himself
he
wa
abl
to
reach
back
for
that
littl
extra
i
hate
thi
too
when
the
game
wa
on
the
line
ye
morri
is
crap
out
big
time
thi
year
but
let
not
chang
histori
to
suit
the
present
btw
i
think
he
should
be
put
in
the
bullpen
it
would
be
embarrass
a
veteran
pitcher
which
cito
would
never
do
but
hi
era
is
how
much
more
can
he
be
embarrass
from
where
i
sit
ill
let
other
have
the
excel
player
ill
settl
for
good
enough
and
the
ring
