whi
they
want
to
cut
down
on
the
time
spent

he
wa
order
back
immedi
a
soon
a
he
step
out
hirschbeck
told
him
to
get
back
in
the
box
now
gant
doesnt
take
a
lot
of
walk
between
pitch
the
onli
reason
he
did
then
becaus
he
wa
veri
bother
by
the
call
i
expect
hi
concentr
wasnt
there
yet
and
in
a
crucial
situat
i
imagin
it
best
to
be
a
calm
a
possibl
contribut
factor
would
be
gant
bad
day
at
the
plate
bad
year
at
the
plate
and
the
brave
long
score
drought
and
it
is
not
hirschbeck
job
to
help
gant
with
ani
of
these
difficulti
if
gant
cant
gather
hi
concentr
for
whatev
reason
that
just
make
him
all
the
more
meat
in
the
batter
box
the
umpir
job
is
to
maintain
flow
of
play
gant
is
not
entitl
to
time
to
regath
hi
faculti
nor
is
anyon
el
now
it
pretti
stupid
to
go
ahead
and
talk
the
walk
when
the
umpir
is
tell
you
to
get
in
there
you
know
the
umpir
is
go
to
do
someth
call
for
a
strike
throw
you
out
etc
gant
wa
wrong
absolut
i
think
itd
be
more
accur
to
say
gant
wa
foolish
but
hirschbeck
wa
more
wrong
in
my
bias
view
asid
from
the
major
chip
he
seem
to
have
on
hi
shoulder
what
wa
the
problem
gant
had
a
reason
to
want
some
time
disput
strike
call
if
a
disput
strike
call
is
ampl
reason
for
a
timeout
game
would
last
about
ninefifteen
week
if
jack
morri
or
dave
whiner
stieb
were
pitch
a
disput
strike
call
is
not
suffici
for
a
time
out
suck
it
up
get
back
in
the
box
and
never
badmouth
the
blue
theyr
not
go
to
chang
their
mind
and
your
just
go
to
come
across
a
a
pinhead
which
wont
help
you
with
the
borderlin
call
ftr
i
never
speak
to
umpir
when
i
dont
know
them
person
nor
do
i
glanc
at
them
or
react
to
call
a
a
result
i
think
i
get
more
than
my
fair
share
of
borderlin
call
at
the
plate
becaus
i
have
a
rep
of
have
a
good

there
are
a

neg
connot
