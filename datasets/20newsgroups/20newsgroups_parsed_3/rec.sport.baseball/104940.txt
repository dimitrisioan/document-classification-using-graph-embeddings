at

oh
of
the
time

just
a
like
to
opt
for
get
the
base
hit
and
help
their
averag
a
get
the
sacrific
the
best
exampl
i
know
of
is
jerri
willard
in
the
seri
against
minnesota
all
he
had
to
do
wa
put
one
in
the
of
and
the
game
wa
over
he
swung
waaaaaay
past
parallel
and
accomplish
bare
get
the
run
in
safe
stat
did
a
littl
studi
in
the
scoreboard
book
entitl
can
you
hit
sacrific
fli
on
purpos
a
summari
of
the
find
over
the
year
period
sacfli
type
fli
ball
were
produc
percent
of
the
time
in
situat
where
a
sac
fli
wa
use
and
percent
of
the
time
when
a
sac
fli
wasnt
use
they
look
at
the
leader
in
sac
fli
and
found
that
the
leader
in
sac
fli
in
other
word
the
guy
you
would
expect
to
be
good
at
it
it
hit
sac
fli
type
fli
ball
onli
more
often
when
they
need
to
a
differ
way
too
small
to
be
the
result
of
a
skill
essenti
the
player
who
hit
a
lot
of
sac
fli
seem
to
do
so
becaus
they
hit
hit
sac
fli
type
fli
often
with
and
without
a
runner
on
third
stat
conclud
so
it
appear
conclus
that
hitter
can
not
hit
sacrific
fli
on
purpos
even
if
they
practic
in
the
bat
cage
