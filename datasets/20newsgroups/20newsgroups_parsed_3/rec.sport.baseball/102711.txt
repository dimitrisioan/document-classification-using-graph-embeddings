singer
said
we
know
that
veri
veri
few
player
at
thi
age
make
much
of
an
impact
in
the
big
especi
when
they
havent
even
play
aaa
ball
ye
but
thi
is
irrelev
your
talk
about
averag
when
we
have
lot
of
inform
about
thi
player
in
particular
to
base
our
decis
on
do
you
realli
have
that
much
inform
on
him
realli
i
dont
person
but
clay
just
post
it
ye
we
do
unfortun
it
show
that
lopez
wasnt
a
good
an
exampl
a
niev
would
have
been
sinc
hi
last
year
number
were
out
of
line
with
the
previou
year
which
i
didnt
have
access
to
the
point
remain
though
know
a
guy
minor
leagu
histori
is
a
good
a
know
hi
major
leagu
histori
if
you
know
how
to
read
it
whi
isnt
lopez
like
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjust
hi
stat
for
park
and
leagu
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolut
scale
than
olson
or
berryhil
did
by
a
lot
i
dont
know
you
tell
me
what
percentag
of
player
reach
or
exceed
their
mle
in
their
rooki
season
were
talk
about
you
know
the
mle
is
not
a
project
it
an
equival
it
a
thi
is
how
well
he
hit
last
year
in
major
leagu
term
rate
so
in
essenc
he
ha
alreadi
reach
it
i
would
guess
bob
clay
that
essenti
half
of
all
player
surpass
their
previou
mle
in
their
rooki
season
mayb
more
than
half
sinc
all
of
these
player
are
young
and
improv
if
that
were
your
purpos
mayb
offerman
spent
get
acclim
if
you
will
the
dodger
a
a
team
paid
a
big
price
that
season
did
they
offerman
may
have
been
the
differ
between
th
or
th
place
and
last
place
but
no
more
perhap
they
will
reap
the
benefit
down
the
road
do
you
realli
think
they
would
have
done
what
they
did
if
they
were
compet
for
a
pennant
sure
they
didnt
have
anyon
better
i
suppos
they
might
have
gut
the
farm
system
to
acquir
jay
bell
or
spike
owen
or
somebodi
if
they
were
realli
in
content
the
point
wa
not
that
ab
is
a
signific
sampl
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anyth
in
spring
train
to
caus
even
a
blockhead
manag
to
question
whether
hi
minor
leagu
number
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
get
warm
up
for
a
stathead
im
amaz
that
you
put
ani
credenc
in
spring
train
if
youd
read
what
i
wrote
youd
be
le
amaz
nowher
do
i
claim
to
put
ani
credenc
in
spring
train
quit
the
contrari
i
said
that
lopez
hadnt
done
anyth
that
even
the
bozo
who
do
put
credenc
in
spring
train
could
interpret
a
failur
just
becaus
i
think
spring
train
number
are
meaningless
doesnt
mean
that
bobbi
cox
doe
it
just
a
case
of
rule
out
one
possibl
explan
for
send
lopez
