im
sure
someon
out
there
in
netland
ha
some
fact
about
trend
in
attend
regard
percentag
of
capac

but
even
if
the
trend
are
rel
flat
you
have
to
consid
what
is
happen
on
a
teambyteam

when
the

will
be
seek
to
supplant
the
lost

from
altern
sourc
one
of
the
best
sourc
may
be
ticket
sale
exampl
the
dodger
the
dodger
can
count
on
a
strong
base
of
season
ticket
sale
and
probabl
believ
that
they
have
the
abil
to
rais
price
without
hinder
revenu
i
certainli
think
that
is
true
exampl
the
padr
they
will
be
lucki
to
averag
fan
a

thi
year
if
they
rais

if
they
want
to
increas
their
overal
revenu
base
the
best
thing
they
can
do
is
put
a
win
team
on
the
field
but
given
that
wont
happen
it
wont
they
can
probabl
make
more
money
by
lower
ticket
price
and
run
frequent
promot
will
they
do
that
i
have
no
idea
but
they
wont
increas
price
becaus
it
wont
work
for
them
even
assum
that
you
have
some
strang
power
to
make
the

that
doe
not
decreas

the
forc
of
the
market
place
each
team
market
is
somewhat
differ
and
each

is
go
to
be
face
with
a
uniqu
set
of
circumst
about
how
to

with
those

would
never
want
to
lower
