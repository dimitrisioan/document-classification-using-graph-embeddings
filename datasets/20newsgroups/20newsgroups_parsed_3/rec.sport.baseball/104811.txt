but
collect
of
statist
are
author
by
bill

bob

some
thought
and
fact
bill
jame
is
a
partial
owner
of
stat
inc
howev
he
ha
almost
noth
to
do
with
the
daytoday
oper
of
the
compani
although
he
doe
have
signific
input
into
the
design
of
the
book
that
bear
hi
name
the
handbook
but
not
the
scoreboard
to
the
best
of
my
knowledg
the
onli
thing
that
bill
actual
write
for
stat
are
the
predict
section
of
the
handbook
and
the
bill
jame
fantasi
basebal
rulebook
the
debat
over
elia
goe
way
back
bill
jame
earli
stuff
wa
hamper
by
the
fact
that
elia
would
not
give
access
to
their
stat
at
ani
price
project
scoresheet
and
later
stat
were
found
to
fill
thi
void
you
can
call
stat
and
ask
them
for
a
report
on
just
about
anyth
in
their
databas
and
they
will
provid
it
for
a
price
of
cours
or
you
could
just
log
into
their
onlin
system
and
look
at
the
data
yourself
have
attempt
to
pri
number
from
elia
in
the
past
footbal
not
basebal
they
just
dont
do
that
in
stat
eye
the
