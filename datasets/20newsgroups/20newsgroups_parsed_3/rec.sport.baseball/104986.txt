i
just
dont
happen
to
think
that
the
minut
ad
to
the
length
of
game
over
the
last
year
ha
ad
anyth
interest
how
would
you
quantifi
that
i
suppos
an
easi
way
would
be
to
look
at
attend
figur
anyon
got
the
number
attend
figur
arent
go
to
quantifi
anyth
about
my
person
opinion

a
add
to
me
to
the
end
of
my
sentenc
if
your
confus
about
what
i
meant
oh
no
i
wasnt
confus
i
understood
that
it
wa
your
person
opinion
but
i
thought
we
were
discus
the
need
to
shorten
game
the
argument
which
declar
thi
need
seem
to
hing
on
the
assert
that
long
game
bore
peopl
and
otherwis
discourag
them
from
go
to
the
ballpark
id
like
to
see
if
the
increas
length
of
game
ha
neg
affect
attend
if
it
ha
then
there
is
a
problem
and
someth
should
be
done
about
it
if
it
hasnt
then
there
isnt
a
problem
and
there
no
need
to
monkey
with
thing
