my
question
to
you
all
is
whi
doe
the
medium
seem
to
embrac
the
theme
of
the
death
of
basebal
so
strongli
i
have
seen
articl
of
a
similar
vein
in
the
chicago
tribun
and
in
sport
editori
on
tv
mayb
becaus
basebal
is
the
onli
busi
where
those
who
are
respons
for
the
fiscal
aspect
of
the
game
preach
gloom
and
doom
these
allegedli
intellig
peopl
seem
to
predict
bad
time
lose
money
bankruptci
at
an
alarm
rate
and
there
go
to
be
an
increas
degrad
of
the
product
they
produc
could
you
imagin
ibm

all
their
problem
promot
themselv
the
way
major
leagu
basebal
doe
their
stock
would
plummet
to
unthink
depth
not
that
they
are
too
far
from
it
now
what
would
happen
at
gm
where
would
gm
be
if
they
admit
to
cut
corner
and
produc
an
inferior
product
becaus
of
alleg
labor
problem
i
think
it
show
a
lack
of
confid
for
the
peopl
who
run
the
game
anyway
it
just
frustrat
me
