wa
releas
last

i
kept
say
that
slaught
should
get
the
bulk
of
the
play
time
that
he
wa
clearli
the
better
player
at
thi
point
but
leyland
insist
on
keep
a
pretti
strict
platoon
and
now
he
is
releas
that
doesnt
make
ani
sens
to
me
greg
the
stori
go
like
thi
spanki
is
too
slow
if
he
were
quicker
he
would
still
be
here
but
with
slaught
and
tom
princ
they
didnt
want
to
lose
princ
in
order
to
bring
up
that
th
pitcher
slaught
is
about
a
good
a
spanki
and
princ
is
come
along
nice
well
my
question
still
hasnt
been
answer
if
spanki
wa
bad
enough
to
releas
thi
year
whi
did
he
get
so
much
play
time
last
year
ye
i
know
he
wa
part
of
a
platoon
and
that
whi
he
got
more
play
time
than
slaught
but
that
doesnt
answer
the
question
if
slaught
wa
so
obvious
better
thi
year
wasnt
thi
also
obviou
last
year
and
shouldnt
he
have
been
take
away

of
spanki
play
