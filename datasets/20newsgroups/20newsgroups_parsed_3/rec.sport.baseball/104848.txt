out

not
like
deon
i
think
he
all
hype
hi
season
last
year
wa
good
but
im
not
convinc
that
he
can
do
it
again
it
remind
me
sorri
of
the
year
when
tim
wallach
hit
or
so
homer
and
had
rbi
it
never
even
came
close
to
happen
again
of
cours
mayb
i
just
prefer
guy
who
go
about
their
busi
and
dont
play
it
up
for
the
attent
just
my
ho
tim
wallach
can
be
explain
with
the
rabbitbal
deion
can
be
explain
a
learn
how
to
play
the
game
im
not
bet
that
deion
will
be
abl
to
play
a
well
a
last
year
but
i
think
the
odd
of
deion
play
a
well
or
better
than
he
did
last
year
are
better
than
the
odd
of
oti
nixon
do
the
same
thing
when
you
factor
in
defens
oti
wa
more
valuabl
last
year
but
im
not
convinc
hell
be
more
valuabl
thi
year
and
especi
next
year
dale
