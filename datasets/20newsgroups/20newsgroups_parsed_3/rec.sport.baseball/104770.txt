write
it
is
doubt
that
the
blue
jay
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morri
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starter
were
be
shell
and
milwauke
wa
make
a
charg
morri
went
with
a
pretti
good
era
i
cant
rememb
exactli
also
let
not
underestim
the
import
hi
inning
to
save
the
bullpen
everi
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
u
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
seri
hi
run
support
wa
high
run
but
so
wa
stottlemy
run
and
he
won
onli
game
i
do
rememb
morri
win
an
inordin
number
of
and
ballgam
but
thi
is
to
hi
credit
he
pitch
onli
a
good
a
he
need
to
be
when
he
wa
up
in
a
ballgam
he
just
put
it
in
cruis
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batter
get
themselev
out
i
hate
thi
express
an
inexperienc
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
tri
to
make
perfect
pitch
to
keep
hi
era
down
but
morri
be
a
veteran
pitcher
know
that
win
is
the
onli
thing
that
realli
matter
in
basebal
by
save
himself
he
wa
abl
to
reach
back
for
that
littl
extra
i
hate
thi
too
when
the
game
wa
on
the
line
i
dont
buy
thi
at
all
i
think
thing
are
color
to
a
veri
larg
degre
of
preconceiv
notion
of
who
the
player
involv
are
tri
thi
exercis
xxx

in
the
first
inning
and
in
the
fourth
xxx
give
up
in
the
st
through
th
in
the
fifth

give
up
run
in

th
he
give
up
more
the
score

a
well
a
