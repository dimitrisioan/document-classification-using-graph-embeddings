write
there
too
mani
s
here
for
my
tast
by
now
which
mean
ive
reach
my
maximum
depth
on
thi
thread
ive
cut
out
some
thing
below
but
noth
that
should
affect
the
sen
of
the
discus
i
agre
ill
delet
more

mike
fester
write
jonathan
king
write
perhap
you
can
give
a
more
recent
citat
of
ani
player
mention
a
a
malinger
thank
i
guess
i
dont
understand
your
question
i
wa
tri
to
impli
that
the
accus
of
glenn
davi
maling
were
certainli
not
play
up
veri
much
still
if
the
whisper
reach
san
francisco
it
is
certainli
possibl
they
were
stronger
elsewher
also
it
wa
teammat
make
the
asper
in
ani
event
i
know
of
no
other
player
to
be
malign
in
the
last
coupl
year
but
in
ani
case
i
believ
mike
lavallier
ha
been
accus
of
poor
work
habit
and
gener
sloth
recent
probabl
not
maling
just
a
he
wa
be
releas
it
interest
that
nobodi
heard
much
about
these
problem
befor
if
they
were
so
import
i
have
heard
sander
call
mani
thing
a
well
i
have
not
heard
him
call
lazi
given
the
sport
phenomenon
it
would
be
difficult
to
label
him
a
such
exactli
so
which
mean
hi
medium
detractor
have
had
to
say
other
thing
about
him
i
believ
it
a
gener
phenomenon
that
if
writer
dont
like
you
theyll
find
a
label
that
will
stick
no
matter
who
you
are
i
find
myself
more
interest
in
the
select
of
label
than
in
whi
writer
feel
they
need
to
act
thi
way
not
that
thi
fascin
me
that
much
either
uh
the
origin
author
point
wa
that
black
and
white
player
were
por
tray
differ
by
the
medium
and
toward
thi
he
gave
a
highli
select
list
to
prove
hi
case
sander
name
show
up
eventu
i
disput
that
sander
ha
ever
been
call
lazi
by
the
medium
hmm
big
ego
possibl
club
hous
disturb
etc
is
that
good
press
no
but
it
isnt
the
total
extent
of
the
press
he
receiv
in
pittsburgh
where
he
wa
call
all
kind
of
thing
includ
lazi
and
spoil
by
the
local
columnist
again
the
actual
word
use
may
shift
around
with
time
and
expedi
but
lazi
tend
to
be
higher
on
the
list
for
nonwhit
player
at
least
in
my
subject
opinion
asid
it
might
be
interest
for
somebodi
to
do
an
archiv
studi
on
player
descript
befor
and
after
the
color
barrier
wa
broken
and
on
team
like
the
red
sox
which
have
been
tradit
white
nowaday
most
peopl
think
of
carl
yastrzemski
a
one
of
those
bluecollar
hardwork
guy
but
in
the
earli
s
he
wa
often
portray
a
a
lazi
bum
realli
hmm
i
never
heard
anyon
accus
canseco
of
be
lazi
nor
sierra
ive
heard
accus
that
canseco
wa
a
bad
fielder
but
could
be
a
great
one
if
he
put
hi
mind
to
it
ignor
whether
or
not
he
is
a
actual
dave
stewart
is
wa
one
of
the
most
vocal
about
thi
in
ani
event
that
is
not
lazi
at
least
one
poster
in
the
last
week
ha
fire
off
a
major
screed
on
the
cansecoislazi
issu
so
i
think
your
point
is
at
best
a
quibbl
and
probabl
weaker
than
that
uh
that
poster
specif
state
allow
me
to
be
the
first
it
is
not
a
quibbl
then
to
state
that
the
medium
did
not
portray
canseco
a
be
lazi
if
the
other
person
choos
to
so
accus
him
after
my
post
that
doe
not
make
it
a
quibbl
and
in
fact
the
medium
around
here
tend
to
play
up
hi
time
in
the
wieght
room
hardli
lazi
and
hardli
a
quibbl
have
you
ever
seen
ani
mediot
portray
canseco
a
lazi
unconcern
with
hi
field
ye
lazi
no
bad
fielder
i
think
thi
is
still
interest
for
that
matter
i
think
canseco
color
offfield
antic
get
lot
more
nation
attent
than
those
of
say
roger
clemen
well
he
had
a
few
more
of
them
at
least
more
that
youv
heard
about
i
think
one
of
the
question
here
surround
select
report
have
said
that
i
have
to
say
that
the
select
report
hypothesi
ha
the
potenti
to
be
unfalsifi
at
least
by
those
of
u
who
arent
report
polic
or
privat
investig
well
canseco
ha
been
involv
in
sever
feloni
includ
hi
highspe
record
carri
conceal
firearm
and
of
cours
the
domest
violenc
clemen
had
a
runin
at
a
bar
canseco
had
that
a
well
and
in
both
case
the
coverag
wa
rel
minim
puckett
stewart
jackson
i
said
overrepres
nonwhit
three
anecdot
data
point
dont
make
an
interest
counterargu
btwwhich
jackson
are
we
talk
about
here
reggi
bo
darrin
danni
or
uh
if
the
onli
evid
offer
is
anecdot
how
can
it
be
object
that
the
counter
to
it
is
also
anecdot
and
it
seem
like
everybodi
who
ha
ever
won
a
bat
titl
among
other
ha
been
accus
at
some
time
of
care
more
for
hi
own
stat
than
for
the
good
of
the
team
it
also
seem
to
me
that
your
kirbi
puckett
i
have
never
heard
thi
accus
made
of
puckett
i
have
heard
it
of
bogg
actual
i
believ
it
of
him
but
that
anoth
matter
not
live
in
minnesota
i
cant
say
whether
or
not
thi
line
ha
ever
been
use
against
kirbi
there
a
far
a
bogg
goe
im
not
sure
whi
you
bring
him
up
sinc
he
one
of
the
obviou
prototyp
for
the
line
i
quot
along
with
ted
william
rod
carew
and
mani
other
uh
ye
and
i
agre
with
your
ass
of
bogg
rather
specif
howev
you
did
say
everybodi
who
ha
ever
won
a
bat
titl
ha
been
accus
of
selfish
i
have
not
ever
anywher
heard
thi
said
of
puckett
pendleton
either
similarli
brett
b
william
and
other
how
about
daryl
strawberri
and
i
think
the
plu
or
minu
refer
more
to
the
born
again
type
ie
butler
and
gaetti
again
you
seem
to
be
make
an
argument
from
anecdot
on
the
other
hand
my
argument
by
is
of
the
becausejonsaysso
varieti
if
we
have
no
other
data
i
have
to
admit
i
have
problem
gener
list
of
nonwhit
player
who
becam
infam
for
their
religi
or
polit
belief
while
name
like
butler
gaetti
dravecki
knepper
hersheis
et
al
come
roll
out
there
are
other
perhap
they
are
simpli
not
a
outspoken
except
in
the
case
of
the
bornagain
type
i
mention
mike
