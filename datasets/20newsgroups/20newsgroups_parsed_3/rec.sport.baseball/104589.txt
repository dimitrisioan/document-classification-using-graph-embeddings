alomar
hr
split
were
slg
obp
baerga
wa
and
pretti
clearli
alomar
got
a
huge
boost
from
hi
home
park
not
necessarili
it
could
mean
that
or
it
could
mean
that
he
just
hit
a
lot
better
at
home
than
he
did
on
the
road
see
frank
thoma
homeroad
split
in
for
an
exampl
i
would
guess
that
some
of
alomar
split
is
due
to
the
skydom
but
most
of
it
is
probabl
due
just
to
coincid
there
no
way
to
be
sure
of
cours
but
the
onli
hitter
the
skydom
seem
to
regularli
help
a
lot
are
right
hand
home
run
hitter
and
alomar
is
not
a
home
run
hitter
id
say
you
could
make
a
good
for
them
be
about
equal
right
now
tp
rate
baerga
higher
actual
onli
becaus
of
tp
bogu
field
stat
which
rate
alomar
a
the
worst
defens
second
baseman
in
the
leagu
on
a
career
basi
i
think
tp
field
stat
may
mean
someth
but
on
a
season
basi
it
come
up
with
ridicul
result
like
thi
alomar
may
not
be
the
god
of
field
the
medium
say
he
is
but
he
sure
isnt
the
worst
in
basebal
offens
tp
rate
alomar
much
higher
last
year
regard
the
a
v
b
argument
ill
just
say
theyr
both
veri
good
player
with
differ
strength
and
a
bright
futur
