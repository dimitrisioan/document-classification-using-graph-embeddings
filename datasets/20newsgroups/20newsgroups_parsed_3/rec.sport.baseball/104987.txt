reason
for
giant
june
swoon
giant
off
to
a
fast
start
in
articl
kenton
yee
write
in
articl
write
the
giant
have
won
of
their
last
game
behind
some
solid
pitch
exclud
that
win
against
atlanta
if
they
can
stay
around
first
place
after
say
the
first
game
i
think
theyv
got
a
legitim
chanc
at
win
the
pennant
and
mayb
even
more
than
that
dont
you
rememb
that
the
giant
were
in
st
place
a
late
a
june
last
year
then
their
pitch
collaps
their
problem
is
they
have
optimist
onli
good
start
pitcher
swiftbrantlyand
the
bowlerc
rememb
hi
name
the
other
starter
are
extrem
unreli
and
often
get
blast
befor
inning
that
mean
the
alreadi
shallow
bullpen
get
over
work
thi
mean
after
a
few
month
the
bullpen
collaps
and
their
postallstar
record
tend
to
be
much
worst
than
their
preallstar
record
the
bowler
is
john
burkett
who
went
to
last
night
he
is
a
bargain
pickup
on
my
roto
team
i
got
him
at
a
minimum
of
just
a
thought
doe
someon
have
the
wonlost
prepost
allstar
record
for
the
giant
the
last
few
season
i
bet
their
record
tend
to
be
worst
and
worst
a
the
season
goe
on
thi
is
not
realli
true
exclud
last
season
the
giant
ha
been
a
better
nd
half
team
in
they
had
a
hot
august
to
pull
to
within
a
few
game
of
the
brave
and
dodger
befor
fade
in
septemb
the
giant
may
go
back
to
earth
but
not
a
fast
a
last
season
for
two
reason
barri
bond
roger
craig
is
no
longer
the
manag
dusti
can
manag
hi
pitch
staff
much
better
than
