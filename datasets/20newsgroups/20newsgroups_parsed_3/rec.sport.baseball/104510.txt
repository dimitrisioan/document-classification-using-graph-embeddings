for
the
hall
of
fame
in
articl
steve
tomassi
write
hi
basebal
fan
so

say
dont
you
think
he
deserv
it
i
mean
heck
if
dave
winfield
hohum
is
serious
be
consid
for
it
a
is
lee
smith
ha
then
whi
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chanc
or
darrel
evan
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of
fame
take
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddi
murray
and
jeff
reardon
oh
yeah
dave
winfieldmargin
player
guy
didnt
hit
a
lick
had
neglig
power
wa
a
crap
fielder
and
had
no
stay
power
dave
winfield
now
enter
hi
i
believ
th
big
leagu
season
is
still
a
damn
decent
hitter
admittedli
hi
defens
ha
slip
a
great
deal
but
in
hi
prime
he
had
a
power
arm
and
great
rang
take
a
look
at
the
stat
i
dont
know
where
you
even
begin
to
make
an
argument
that
winfield
and
kingman
are
similar
player
kingman
wa
a
onedimens
power
hitterh
couldnt
field
he
ran
like
an
anvil
hit
for
a
low
averag
though
if
i
rememb
right
hi
obp
wasnt
that
hideou
and
for
those
who
consid
such
thing
import
wa
a
absoluteprimodick
eddi
murray
yup
onli
the
best
st
baseman
of
the
s
i
know
that
mvp
vote
are
conduct
by
mediot
but
given
that
he
got
job
out
of
the
mvp
he
deserv
in
it
seem
that
he
wasnt
overr
by
the
medium
lee
smith
hmmmm
thi
one
actual
pretti
close
he
had
a
s
solid
depend
career
a
a
closer
despit
pitch
in
some
nasti
park
wrigley
fenway
id
have
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
stat
it
been
a
while
but
it
seem
lee
arthur
is
of
hof
calib
you
do
make
a
legitim
point
about
the
hof
credenti
of
reliev
simpli
rack
up
a
lot
of
save
doesnt
mean
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
if
you
blow
a
bunch
too
simpli
becaus
minnesota
and
boston
and
for
a
month
atlanta
use
reardon
a
a
closer
for
longer
than
he
should
have
been
one
the
equal
ha
rack
up
an
impress
number
of
save
no
way
should
homerman
be
in
the
hof
imho
darrel
evan
nice
career
actual
a
bit
underr
kinda
like
ted
simmon
imho
but
not
a
hofer
well
in
ani
case
i
am
sick
and
tire
mostli
sick
of
everybodi
give
hall
of
fame
consider
to
player
that
are
by
today
standard
margin
lem
me
ask
you
thi
who
the
hell
play
the
game
isnt
margin
honestli
ozzi
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyr
both
shortstop
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
let
be
a
littl
more
select
huh
stop
hand
out
these
honor
so
liber
save
them
for
the
guy
who
realli
deserv
it
face
it
if
someth
now
wait
a
goddamn
minut
here
ozzi
smith
absolut
redefin
the
posit
of
shortstop
hi
defens
wa
so
good
that
he
won
someth
along
the
line
of
gold
glove
again
gold
glove
are
mediotbias
and
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
larkin
deserv
one
or
two
of
ozzi
more
recent
award
but
usual
thi
is
temper
by
someon
els
in
the
earli
s
get
the
gold
glove
ozzi
deserv
earlier
in
hi
career
ozzi
offens
you
ask
good
obp
great
speed
number
in
a
park
which
for
most
of
hi
career
depress
offens
admittedli
no
power
cept
against
tom
niedenfu
but
still
a
definit
asset
offens
yount
hit
mvp
at
two
differ
posit
uhhuh
a
real
stiff
hi
wa
one
of
the
great
year
ever
by
a
player
in
recent
memori
and
probabl
rank
behind
onli
the
peak
season
of
wagner
and
bank
a
far
a
s
number
go
he
a
clear
hofer
imho
isnt
done
there
will
be
littl
prestig
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymor
when
certain
individu
believ
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morri
are
potenti
candid
the
absurd
is
appar
gee
can
these
guy
even
compar
to
the
more
like
futur
hall
of
famer
like
kirbi
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
well
a
far
a
garvey
go
your
right
garvey
is
a
mediot
candid
push
becaus
of
hi
win
attitud
a
minor
factor
if
one
at
all
and
hi
great
defens
no
error
admittedli
but
the
rang
of
a
tree
stump
garvey
shouldnt
be
in
the
hof
skyjack
ive
said
a
lot
of
nasti
thing
about
skyjack
in
the
last
year
or
so
but
thi
is
mostli
in
respons
to
mediot
and
woofer
who
talk
about
morri
abil
to
win
which
is
noth
more
than
morri
abil
to
pitch
when
toronto
to
score
ton
of
run
at
thi
point
morri
is
an
averag
pitcher
although
from
hi
earli
return
in
he
may
be
damn
close
to
done
but
in
all
fair
morri
wa
a
domin
pitcher
in
the
s
for
upanddown
tiger
team
while
wa
obvious
a
great
year
for
detroit
the
rest
of
the
decad
the
team
wa
gener
in
content
but
not
favorit
morri
career
number
are
quit
good
and
worthi
of
hof
consider
ryan
of
cours
but
be
care
i
guarante
you
that
someon
will
throw
back
your
earlier
logic
about
yount
and
smith
be
shortstop
who
hung
around
a
long
time
after
all
nolan
never
won
a
cy
damn
he
just
pitcher
who
hung
around
for
year
hi
wl
record
is
mediocr
of
cours
nolan
a
hofer
puck
probabl
although
he
got
to
play
reason
well
for
a
few
more
year
year
even
good
one
arent
enough
to
make
the
hof
most
like
that
said
i
believ
puckett
will
make
the
hof
pretti
much
regardless
of
how
the
rest
of
hi
career
turn
out
bar
someth
realli
tragic
or
sudden
he
veri
popular
in
the
medium
and
with
fan
and
legitim
ha
been
one
of
the
best
cf
in
the
game
sinc
he
join
the
leagu
ive
alway
like
the
guy
and
i
hope
he
doe
make
it
and
in
the
end
i
think
the
puck
will
make
it
in
but
realli
it
too
earli
to
sell
thi
debat
come
up
rather
frequent
on
the
net
and
believ
it
or
not
i
never
tire
of
it
it
