of
those
three
wip
ha
the
best
host
hand
down
chuck
cooperstein
isnt
a
homer
and
neither

jodi
mac
wtem
is
too
gener
to
be
place
in
the
catergori
in
fact
if
you
have
heard
wtem
and
the
fan
you
notic
the
theme
music
is
identicalsam
ownership
i
think
so
wip
is
total
origin
their
host
actual
have
a
person
thi
is
a
knock
at
tem
the
team
not
the

the
mad
dog

sommer

good
i
mean
compar
the
morn
guy
in
philadelphia
to
the
one
in
washington
is
a
total
joke
anyway

sport
phone
after
the
philli
game

oldi
station
