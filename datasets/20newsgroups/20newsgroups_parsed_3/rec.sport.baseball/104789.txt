rbi
risp
and
slg
off
and
on
over
the
last
sever
month
thread
about
rbi
and
relat
topic
have
gotten
me
to
think
about
how
well
we
can
predict
a
player
rbi
use
inform
about
hi
overal
perform
and
the
number
of
runner
in
score
posit
risp
that
he
bat
with
in
the
brock
model
bill
jame
calcul
predict
rbi
a
rbitot
base
home
run
thi
complet
ignor
the
context
which
wa
all
that
brock
could
do
sinc
context
wa
unknown
to
it
so
i
thought
id
take
that
idea
a
a
start
point
and
look
how
good
a
fit
to
the
data
you
get
by
compar
rbihom
run
to
slgrisp
ive
start
with
team
data
use
data
from
the
elia
that
ive
pick
up
over
the
year
when
a
i
could
afford
them
and
b
i
could
stomach
the
thought
of
increas
elia
profit
that
gave
me
the
year
and
i
dont
have
team
rbi
for
or
i
could
add
that
year
if
you
run
a
simpl
least
squar
fit
to
the
data
you
get
rbihom
run
slgrisp
the
correl
between
the
lh
and
the
rh
is
which
is
signific
at
a
ridicul
high
level
so
i
feel
like
the
fit
is
good
at
the
team
level
ive
no
start
to
move
on
to
the
player
level
and
have
look
at
player
will
clark
ozzi
smith
joe
carter
and
don
mattingli
i
hope
to
add
quit
a
few
more
dure
my
copiou
free
time
thi
year
it
doesnt
do
too
badli
except
the
equat
underpredict
the
low
hr
hitter
smith
which
may
be
a
fault
of
the
model
or
it
could
just
be
ozzi
the
result
rbihr
year
actual
predict
carter
clark
mattli
smith
i
think
we
can
make
a
case
and
i
hope
to
make
it
stronger
that
rbi
can
be
predict
simpli
from
know
how
a
player
slug
overal
and
how
mani
men
are
in
score
posit
when
he
come
up
