re
zanerescu
u
from
simmon
mamatha
devineni
ratnam
write
so
far
simmon
look
like
a
total
idiot
whatev
you
say
i
think
it
just
game
into
the
season
myself
so
im
go
to
wait
a
bit
befor
call
name
i
am
sure
simmon
wa
readi
to
say
i
told
you
so
after
otto
had
an
impress
win
last
week
now
otto
latest
debacl
ha
restor
simmon
reput
now
he
look
like
he
is
back
in
hi
form
when
he
had
the
al
highest
era
among
starter
four
our
sakenot
ted
sake
i
hope
he
pitch
with
a
era
for
the
rest
of
the
season
yeah
right
i
expect
that
dave
otto
will
be
a
realli
bad
pitcher
and
i
have
no
idea
whi
simmon
ever
want
him
on
the
other
hand
i
expect
him
to
releas
otto
if
he
doesnt
turn
thing
around
pretti
fast
btw
otto
game
score
for
that
ip
stinker
wa
onli
which
point
out
a
problem
with
the
method
sinc
otto
perform
wa
infinit
bad
and
excruciatingli
prolong
tomlin
and
merc
are
a
bit
disappoint
they
are
still
do
decent
but
consid
the
consider
amount
of
talent
and
matur
they
have
shown
their
first
season
they
seem
to
have
actual
gotten
a
littl
bit
wors
i
think
merc
rooki
year
wa
a
bit
flukey
but
arent
you
will
to
give
him
some
more
at
bat
and
tomlin
a
few
more
start
befor
act
so
gloomi
walk
well
he
seem
to
be
on
the
lose
end
tonight
but
i
still
think
that
walk
desrv
hi
contract
no
he
didnt
walk
is
a
time
bomb
he
ha
no
stuff
whatsoev
and
when
the
leagu
final
realiz
thi
it
wont
be
pretti
at
all
the
rooki
batter
well
young
ha
surpris
me
a
bit
with
hi
instant
impact
other
than
that
their
excel
perform
hasnt
been
too
much
of
a
surpris
i
think
we
should
thank
doughti
for
that
dont
be
so
fast
doughti
is
the
guy
who
sign
steve
buechel
which
wa
a
move
that
threaten
to
buri
kevin
young
in
the
minor
meanwhil
im
not
sure
whether
doughti
or
simmon
sign
martin
a
a
sixyear
free
agent
befor
the
season
rooki
pitcher
wors
than
expect
especi
cook
twice
through
the
rotat
and
youv
given
up
yike
slaught
how
come
he
wasnt
given
a
contract
extens
last
year

be
much
longer

lonni
smith

davi
wa
sign

a
compar
amount
but
he
want
to
be
a
dodger
and

ani
chanc
for
the

now
whi
didnt
the
pirat
go
after
eric
davi
an
injur
davi

even
if
lonnni
smith
get
some
big
hit
thi
yearh

packag
deal
anybodi
who
acquir
lonni

the
biggest
accomplish
of

tenur
wa
get
alex
cole
realli
cheap
too
bad
that
he
gave
him
away
in
the
expans
draft

sinc
leyland

wa
probabl
unavoid
meanwhil
i
think
bigger
accomplish
of

smiley
not
trade
real
prospect
for
veteran
down
the
stretch
last
year

well
in
let
the
rooki
show
someth
in
foley
smith
and
candelaria
were
acquir
to
be
replac
part
which
mean
that
even
if
fail
it
hasnt
done
seriou
damag
to
the
buc
futur
compensatori
draft
pick
for
