seri
wa
a
realli
strang
one
yup
i
wa
wonder
the
whole
time
whi
the
brave
most
talent
outfield
neon
deon
wa
not
start
here
whoa
arent
you
forget
a
coupl
of
guy
name
gant
and
justic
a
guy
who
can
hit
hr
leadoff
and
steal
he
can
lead
off
hell
probabl
steal
he
might
hit
hell
never
hit
homer
i
think
you
went
for
on
thi
one
base
and
they
start
guy
like
nixon
and
bream
ahead
of
him
i
cant
realli
see
that
advantag
of
nixon
over
deon
except
that
nixon
is
a
better
defens
outfield
you
said
it
all
right
there
doe
anyon
el
out
there
not
like
deon
i
think
he
all
hype
hi
season
last
year
wa
good
but
im
not
convinc
that
he
can
do
it
again
it
remind
me
sorri
of
the
year
when
tim
wallach
hit
or
so
homer
and
had
rbi
it
never
even
came
close
to
happen
again
of
cours
mayb
i
just
prefer
guy
who
go
about
their
busi
and
dont
play
it
up
