actual
i
think
the
largescal
sampl
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seem
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
player
in
basebal
in
regard
to
ba
v
clutch
ba
deviat
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curv
the
xaxi
be
the
deviat
in
clutch
hit
v
nonclutch
the
yaxi
be
the
number
of
player
certainli
there
would
be
some
player
on
the
extrem
end
of
the
bell
my
supposit
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
player
consist
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
abl
to
make
some
reason
conclus
about
those
player
a
oppos
to
all
basebal
player
let
be
care
here
if
player
perform
wa
complet
random
in
clutchno
clutch
then
you
would
still
expect
some
player
to
be
good
in
the
clutch
everi
year
and
some
to
be
notsogood
everi
year
with
two
year
worth
of
data
youd
have
of
the
player
good
each
year
bad
each
year
and
would
have
one
good
and
one
bad
year
we
have
player
for
year
just
flip
a
coin
youd
expect
player
to
be
good
all
year
and
to
be
bad
everi
year
thi
is
what
we
actual
get
no
of
good
year
clutch
perform
coin
flip
random
essenti
the
distribut
of
clutch
perform
by
number
of
year
of
good
perform
is
the
same
a
what
you
would
get
if
the
process
lead
to
deviat
from
nonclutch
perform
wa
complet
random
if
there
wa
anyth
to
clutch
hit
at
least
in
thi
definit
that
had
ani
predict
capabl
you
expect
to
see
the
number
of
player
at
the
end
to
be
much
larger
than
that
predict
by
flip
a
coin
further
if
you
limit
yourself
to
player
who
were
a
lot
abov
or
below
averag
in
clutch
situat
say
standard
deviat
from
the
mean
more
than
one
year
the
random
explan
still
look
good
in
the
four
year
that
i
look
at
the
data
from
elia
there
were
player
with
a
minimum
of
at
bat
in
clutch
situat
that
were
sigma
from
the
mean
two
differ
year
of
those
player
of
them
chang
sign
between
the
two
year
in
other
word
they
were
great
clutch
hitter
one
year
and
realli
horribl
the
other
year
if
it
wa
just
a
random
process
youd
expect
those
number
to
be
everyth
that
been
measur
about
clutch
hit
over
a
period
of
year
that
could
be
use
to
predict
ani
abil
with
ani
propos
definit
ha
look
like
a
random
process
with
the
caveat
that
there
may
be
someth
relat
to
platoon
advantag
that
could
be
drag
out
of
the
dataeg
john
lowenstein
probabl
never
had
a
clutch
ab
against
a
lefthand
pitcher
but
he
might
well
have
had
some
in
blowout
so
that
there
would
be
a
bia
sinc
hi
clutch
ab
would
be
more
gear
to
hi
platoon
advantag
thi
is
not
a
subject
that
ha
been
glanc
at
casual
a
lot
of
peopl
have
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
studi
it
and
everi
one
of
them
with
the
except
of
the
elia
studi
ha
been
unabl
to
find
anyth
that
would
allow
you
to
predict
how
someon
will
do
in
clutch
situat
better
than
flip
a

selfserv
