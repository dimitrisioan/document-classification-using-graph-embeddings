write
the
fact
are
that
morri
ha
shown
u
that
he
ha
what
it
take
to
play
on
a
w
win
club
clemen
hasnt
what
doe
it
take
to
play
on
a
w
win
club
we
have
no
way
of
know
becaus
we
can
not
separ
morri
contribu
tion
from
the
rest
of
the
team
there
is
onli
one
way
of
determin
ing
best
in
basebal
and
that
is
by
look
at
the
scoreboard
at
the
end
of
the
game
each
game
determin
which
team
is
the
best
that
day
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
team
that
wa
the
best
the
most
often
is
the
best
in
the
divis
the
playoff
determin
the
best
of
the
best
but
the
point
is
that
the
onli
decis
make
pro
ce
use
to
determin
the
best
is
the
score
of
the
game
and
it
re
late
to
the
team
not
the
individu
player
there
is
no
method
inher
in
basebal
of
compar
individu
perform
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
becaus
after
all
basebal
is
a
team
game
to
say
that
one
player
is
better
than
anoth
is
to
be
abl
to
say
ab
solut
that
player
a
team
would
have
play
better
with
player
b
in
their
lineup
sheer
specul
imposs
to
ascertain
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statist
and
claim
that
clemen
ha
done
better
with
those
statist
a
a
criterion
then
fine
but
you
have
to
be
abl
to
prove
that
those
statist
measur
the
individu
contribut
to
win
the
w
becaus
that
is
the
onli
measur
of
best
that
ha
ani
mean
in
the
context
of
base
ball
so
until
you
can
prove
that
clemen
contribut
to
a
w
cham
pionship
more
than
morri
your
evalu
of
clemen
is
total
sub
jectiv
and
is
mere
opinion
i
have
yet
to
see
that
ani
of
you
can
predict
a
w
winner
with
ani
greater
accuraci
than
jeann
dixon
the
fact
is
that
morri
didnt
win
ani
ballgam
toronto
did
in
spite
of
morri
contribut
thi
ha
been
explain
to
you
exactli
the
jay
won
with
morri
pitch
and
boston
win
with
clemen
pitch
i
am
not
say
that
morri
is
better
than
clemen
i
am
say
that
individu
comparison
between
player
are
total
meaningless
and
that
anyon
claim
that
clemen
is
better
base
on
hi
era
ha
miss
the
point
of
what
basebal
is
all
about
mani
mani
time
and
you
are
either
too
stupid
or
too
stubborn
to
grasp
it
you
dont
have
to
be
rude
you
are
complet
consum
by
the
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
fallaci
for
you
to
say
that
mean
that
you
have
either
miss
the
entir
point
of
my
argument
or
you
yourself
have
commit
a
fallaci
ignoratio
elenchi
i
am
not
say
that
morri
is
better
than
clemen
becaus
he
ha
more
ring
although
i
have
tongu
in
cheek
claim
that
in
the
past
i
am
say
that
it
is
imposs
to
isol
an
individu
perform
from
that
of
hi
team
for
the
purpos
of
compar
that
individu
perform
with
anoth
individu
per
formanc
the
stat
are
a
nice
hobbi
and
that
about
it
there
is
no
new
knowledg
be
produc
so
when
a
poster
claim
that
morri
is
better
than
clemen
becaus
he
ha
more
ring
the
poster
is
no
more
nor
le
incorrect
than
the
rest
of
you
bay
hound
cordial
a
alway
so

so
