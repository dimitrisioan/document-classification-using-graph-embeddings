wa
re
brave
updat
michael
zimmer
write
first
a
longer
game
in
no
way
suggest
more
basebal
to
watch
unless
you
includ
watch
the
grass
grow
a
basebal
i
definit
do
that
whi
i
dont
like
go
to
see
game
play
on
artifici
turf
the
lengthier
game
are
so
becaus
of
batter
step
out
of
the
box
pitcher
take
longer
between
pitch
and
excess
trip
to
the
mound
by
manag
and
pitch
coach
and
while
it
true
that
the
gap
between
play
can
be
interest
thi
is
onli
true
when
they
dont
becom
extralong
well
your
idea
of
interest
differ
from
mine
i
think
bat
practic
is
interest
for
exampl
and
make
a
special
effort
to
get
to
the
game
veri
earli
in
order
to
see
it
i
think
the
delay
tactic
of
batter
pitcher
catcher
and
manag
are
interest
becaus
theyr
attempt
to
gain
advantag
through
control
of
the
flow
and
time
of
the
game
of
cours
the
umpir
can
and
should
interven
when
these
tactic
get
out
of
hand
a
ryan
robbin
ha
point
out
there
are
rule
that
cover
thi
one
of
the
more
fascin
thing
about
basebal
i
think
is
it
openended
with
regard
to
time
you
never
know
if
the
game
is
go
to
zip
right
by
and
be
over
in
le
than
two
hour
or
if
it
go
to
go
on
until
four
in
the
morn
likewis
some
game
are
actionpack
and
some
game
are
slow
and
lazi
that
fine
by
me
those
folk
who
want
constant
action
should
watch
the
game
on
tv
so
they
can
channel
surf
and
cater
to
their
short
attent
span
