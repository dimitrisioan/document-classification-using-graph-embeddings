huckabay
write
it
certainli
not
veri
easi
what
i
do
is
use
frame
advanc
on
the
tape
and
simpli
count
the
frame
five
time
and
tri
to
throw
out
ani
outlier
it
not
perfect
but
it
better
than
a
blow
to
the
head
with
a
larg
metal
object
ah
so
you
final
found
a
use
for
that
super
slomo
and
frame
advanc
other
than
scrutin
soror
babe
in
heat
congrat
i
wish
i
had
film
instead
of
tape
prefer
at
fp
rather
than
but
while
im
at
it
id
like
to
have
ten
million
dollar
and
be
abl
to
eat
anyth
i
want
and
never
gain
ani
weight
either
trust
me
youd
have
a
helluva
time
manipul
them
besid
if
you
convert
the
film
to
video
youd
have
all
kind
of
artifact
becaus
of
the
differ
in
frame
rate
unless
your
an
expert
at
do
pulldown
for
a
laserdisc
compani
or
someth
gari
list
of
the
ten
slowest
bat
in
basebal
hey
no
fair
what
about
fettucin
alfredo
griffin
the
guy
practic
ha
to
pivot
the
bat
around
along
with
hi
bodi
gari
list
of
how
the
hell
can
he
hit
like
that
julio
franco
phil
plantier
darren
daulton
daulton
doesnt
strike
me
a
all
that
strang
he
a
littl
bit
quiet
at
the
plate
but
like
franco
get
the
bat
through
the
hit
zone
on
a
level
plane
the
first
time
i
watch
julio
franco
i
didnt
think
anyon
could
hit
like
that
now
i
marvel
at
how
easi
he
make
it
look
everi
time
he
make
contact
it
solid
he
got
good
power
to
all
field
and
rare
is
he
caught
not
readi
for
a
pitch
i
wonder
if
phil
plantier
had
a
sever
bout
with
hemorrhoid
and
had
to
practic
hi
swing
while
on
the
throne
sure
look
like
it
how
bout
one
to
add
to
your
list
travi
fryman
the
guy
plant
hi
front
foot
and
seem
to
swing
across
hi
bodi
he
gener
a
lot
of
power
but
i
keep
think
he
could
gener
even
more
if
he
could
get
a
better
pivot
out
of
hi
hip
gari
list
of
id
give
dave
kirsch
kidney
to
have
a
swing
like
that
well
theyr
alreadi
spoken
for
by
sever
peopl
but
id
add
robbi
alomar
name
to
the
list
among
other
i
realli
like
dean
palmer
swing
for
some
twist
reason
a
well
a
pedro
munoz
swing
that
all
for
now
im
look
at
derrick
may
tape
tonight
along
with
troy
neel
that
guy
is
a
seriou
ox
a
thought
about
may
it
look
like
theyv
taught
him
to
turn
on
the
ball
imho
he
go
to
fall
in
love
with
hi
newfound
power
and
start
pull
off
the
ball
to
the
point
that
he
go
to
see
lot
of
sinkersslid
low
and
away
unless
he
adjust
quickli
and
start
rifl
doubl
to
left
and
leftcent
imho
your
go
to
see
a
good
number
of
weak
grounder
to
the
right
side
of
the
infield
in
the
next
month
