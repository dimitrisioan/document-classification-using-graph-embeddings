the
strawberri
incid
where
he
lost
a
homerun
and
the

long
a
they

not
interfer
with
ani
that

wa
the

wrong
should

ye
i
think

a
ball
they
realli
should
be
awar
that

the
game
is
more
import
a
a
dodger
fan
he
ha
to
be
awar
that
thi
is
the
home
stadium
and
that
entail
help
the
home
team
win
in
ani
way
possibl
a
soon
a
the
ball
wa
hit
that
far
hi
first
instinct
should
be
to
root
for
darryl
to
catch
it
not
to
tri
to
catch
it
himself
particularli
when
he
is
sit
that
close
i
enjoy
the
attitud
of
the
wrigley
fan
where
they
are
against
visit
team
home
run
so
much
they
actual
throw
them
back
on
the
field
now
thi
ha
noth
to
do
with
whether
darryl
could
have
caught
it
or
not
sure
he
probabl
screw
up
but
the
fan
should
realiz
hi
first
respons
is
to
get
out
of
the
