we

a
run
score
is
just
a
import
a
a
run
prevent
just
a
a
penni
save
is
a
penni
earn
enough
with
the
clich
it
not
a
clich
and
unlik
your
comment
below
it
not
a
tautolog
it
neednt
have
been
true
if
everi
pitcher
in
basebal
were
essenti
the
same
in
qualiti
ie
if
the
varianc
of
pitch
abil
were
much
smaller
than
the
varianc
of
bat
abil
then
score
run
would
be
much
more
import
than
prevent
them
simpli
becaus
the
abil
to
activ
prevent
run
would
be
much
weaker
my
point
is
that
if
the
brave
starter
are
abl
to
live
up
to
their
potenti
they
wont
need
much
offens
support
if
that
your
point
you
should
have
said
so
what
you
in
fact
said
wa
pitch
and
defens
win
championship
and
later
pitch
is
the
essenc
of
basebal
neither
of
which
say
what
you
are
now
claim
wa
your
point
and
neither
of
which
is
true
it
seem
to
me
that
when
qualiti
pitcher
take
the
mound
the
other
team
score
le
run
the
team
that
score
the
most
run
win
and
you
accus
sherri
of
mouth
clich
thi
put
the
team
with
the
better
pitch
at
the
advantag
provid
they
can
stop
the
oppos
team
from
score
run
a
low
score
game
would
clearli
benefit
the
brave
it
not
clear
to
me
at
all
that
thi
is
true
in
highscor
game
the
team
with
the
better
offens
win
a
high
percentag
of
the
time
in
low
score
game
the
split
is
essenti
regardless
of
team
abil
they
should
have
mani
low
score
game
due
to
their
excel
pitch
and
below
averag
hit
on
the
flip
side
if
you
had
a
start
lineup
of
great
offens
player
i
would
be
argu
that
thi
team
would
not
need
great
pitcher
i
thought
you
said
pitch
and
defens
win
championship
and
pitch
is
the
essenc
of
basebal
