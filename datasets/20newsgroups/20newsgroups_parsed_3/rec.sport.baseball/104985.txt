the
brave
will
come
around
to
all
the
brave
doubter
dont
worri
the
bat
will
come
aliv
and
the
brave
will
come
around
the
pitch
is
solid
and
a
long
the
brave
dont
have
seriou
injuri
to
the
start
rotat
theyll
continu
to
pitch
well
heck
with
the
five
starter
on
the
brave
rotat
they
could
even
sustain
an
injuri
to
one
of
the
five
i
hope
thi
doesnt
happen
though
the
bat
are
there
pendleton
will
certainli
bat
over
justic
is
catch
fire
bream
nixon
sander
gant
well
there
too
much
offens
there
to
be
kept
quiet
for
much
longer
right
now
the
cleveland
indian
have
player
bat
over
but
i
certainli
wouldnt
their
seven
for
our
respect
seven
though
wouldnt
the
brave
be
someth
right
now
with
their
pitch
and
player
bat
over
the
bullpen
well
it
is
suspect
but
when
the
bat
come
aliv
the
guy
in
the
bullpen
will
be
of
le
concern
so
anyway
i
believ
the
brave
will
be
tough
to
beat
thi
season
im
not
say
the
brave
have
automat
won
the
divis
but
im
optim
istic
about
their
season
though
it
aw
pain
to
watch
them
at
time
right
now
go
