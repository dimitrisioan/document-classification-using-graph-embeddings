let
me
ask
the
net
would
the
jay
have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morri
given
hi
run
support
how
about
an
averag
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believ
that
morri
perform
in
the
playoff
and
seri
had
a
larg
posit
impact
on
the
jay
perform
i
know
it
veri
trendi
nowaday
to
dump
on
morri
but
let
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubt
that
the
blue
jay
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morri
well
when
you
say
without
morri
you
have
to
mention
an
assum
replac
if
the
altern
to
morri
wa
let
cito
gaston
softtoss
the
ball
underhand
to
the
opposit
everi
day
then
of
cours
the
blue
jay
wouldnt
have
won
without
morri
if
the
altern
wa
replac
level
then
i
think
it
wouldv
been
veri
close
and
ye
morri
mightv
made
the
differ
if
the
altern
wa
frank
viola
the
blue
jay
probabl
would
have
won
more
easili
with
viola
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starter
were
be
shell
and
milwauke
wa
make
a
charg
morri
went
with
a
pretti
good
era
i
cant
rememb
exactli
ye
you
can
make
the
argument
that
the
hi
presenc
prevent
the
team
from
collaps
in
august
also
let
not
underestim
the
import
hi
inning
to
save
the
bullpen
everi
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
u
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
seri
those
inning
were
probabl
help
hi
run
support
wa
high
run
but
so
wa
stottlemy
run
and
he
won
onli
game
i
do
rememb
morri
win
an
inordin
number
of
and
ballgam
but
thi
is
to
hi
credit
he
pitch
onli
a
good
a
he
need
to
be
when
he
wa
up
in
a
ballgam
he
just
put
it
in
cruis
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batter
get
themselev
out
i
hate
thi
express
an
inexperienc
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
tri
to
make
perfect
pitch
to
keep
hi
era
down
but
morri
be
a
veteran
pitcher
know
that
win
is
the
onli
thing
that
realli
matter
in
basebal
by
save
himself
he
wa
abl
to
reach
back
for
that
littl
extra
i
hate
thi
too
when
the
game
wa
on
the
line
well
i
think
is
complet
b
what
happen
most
of
the
time
is
that
morri
fell
behind
and
the
team
came
back
and
rescu
him
mostli
thi
is
becaus
he
a
lousi
st
inning
pitcher
and
much
better
the
rest
of
the
way
that
the
team
can
climb
out
of
hole
consist
and
win
them
is
not
to
morri
credit
it
to
the
team
credit
furthermor
while
morri
did
exceed
the
wl
percentag
that
would
be
project
from
hi
run
allow
and
run
support
he
hasnt
done
thi
in
previou
year
in
fact
hi
wl
record
in
is
a
lot
wors
than
what
it
project
to
be
with
run
support
and
run
allow
do
you
think
he
just
came
up
with
thi
abil
in
look
at
the
postseason
game
he
pitch
decent
in
typic
morri
game
morri
get
behind
team
rescu
him
he
not
respons
for
that
rescu
and
in
both
those
game
the
team
just
didnt
rescu
him
enough
jack
morri
pitch
a
well
a
he
did
dure
much
of
the
season
in
those
game
the
offens
just
didnt
earn
him
a
victori
btw
i
think
he
should
be
put
in
the
bullpen
it
would
be
embarrass
a
veteran
pitcher
which
cito
would
never
do
but
hi
era
is
how
much
more
can
he
be
embarrass
morri
is
one
of
those
guy
who
will
retur
when
he
cant
start
anymor
he
too
bad
a
first
inning
pitcher
to
serv
in
the
bullpen
