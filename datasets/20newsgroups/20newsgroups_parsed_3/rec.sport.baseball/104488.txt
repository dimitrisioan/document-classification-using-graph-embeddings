i

that

howev
whi
doe
everyon
say
that
you
want
lefthand
starter
i
understand
lefthand
spot
reliev
even
though
they
usual
face
more
righthand
batter
than
lefthand
batter
i
just
dont
understand
whi
peopl
insist
on
lefthand
starter
unless
there
is
a
park
effect
eg
yanke
stadium
most
batter
in
mlb
are
righthand
so
righthand
starter
will
have
the
platoon
advantag
more
often
than
lefthand
starter
i
guess
one
argument
for
lefti
starter
is
that
certain
team
may
be
more
vulner
to
lhp
than
rhp
howev
thi
is
probabl
onli
a
factor
in
the
postseason
becaus
team
seldom
juggl
their
starter
for
thi
reason
dure
the
regular
season
i
think
you
just
want
the
best
starter
you
can
get
regardless
of
whether
they
are
lefti
or
righti
lefthand
starter
tend
to
have
higher
era
than
righthand
starter
precis
becaus
manag
go
out
of
their
way
to
start
inferior
lefti
or
perhap
becaus
of
the
platoon
advantag
