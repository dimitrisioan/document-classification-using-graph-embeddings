re
alltim
best
player
in
articl
write
thi
chat
about
the
best
player
of
all
time
is
pointless
you
cant
compar
player
from
differ
era
of
cours
you
can
you
just
have
to
be
care
about
what
conclus
you
draw
if
you
will
notic
the
best
pitcher
stat
wise
were
in
the
s
and
s
and
the
best
all
around
hitter
probabl
came
from
the
s
to
s
huh
the
s
and
s
were
the
worst
decad
for
great
pitch
grove
vanc
dean
and
not
a
whole
lot
el
a
for
the
best
allaround
hitter
statwis
ruth
gehrig
foxx
greenberg
hornsbi
cobb
etc
all
play
befor
the
s
statwis
the
s
were
a
graveyard
for
hitter
now
we
have
a
great
number
of
great
pitcher
and
an
equal
great
number
of
great
hitter
and
fielder
also
how
do
you
know
which
one
do
you
consid
great
about
field
the
glove
were
much
smaller
than
they
are
now
in
the
earli
year
of
basebal
mayb
a
hitter
like
sheffield
with
the
ba
hr
and
rbieven
though
it
wa
probabl
a
fluke
year
can
be
compar
to
a
mantl
becaus
the
pitch
sheffield
face
is
faster
and
not
to
mention
better
the
so
sheffield
also
ha
better
shoe
more
time
between
pitch
you
can
run
the
comparison
but
there
are
lot
of
thing
to
take
into
account
same
could
be
said
for
frank
thoma
who
is
said
to
be
the
best
hitter
sinc
ted
william
although
frank
defens
doe
suck
well
can
we
compar
them
or
cant
we
all
i
am
say
is
that
you
cant
compar
player
from
differ
era
if
you
want
a
best
player
tri
choos
best
player
from
differ
era
that
whi
we
can
compar
player
to
the
standard
of
their
era
and
we
can
keep
in
mind
eratoera
differ
without
throw
up
our
hand
in
despair
way
there
is
reason
basi
for
comparison
you
havent
shown
u
what
unreason
about
the
mantlesheffield
comparison
that
you
yourself
did
