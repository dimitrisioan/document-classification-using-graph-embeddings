write
the
onli
realli
valid
retort
to
valentin
is
werent
the
red
sox
tri
to
get
morri
too
oh
sure
they
said
viola
wa
their
first
choic
afterward
but
what
should
we
have
expect
they
would
say
lou
want
morri
all
along
the
idiot
give
the
man
million
to
play
with
is
like
give
a
five
year
old
a
load
uzi
with
the
safeti
off
the
onli
question
is
how
mani
shot
he
will
get
off
befor
somebodi
is
wise
enough
to
take
it
away
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
thi
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the
divis
more
like
th
if
thi
is
true
it
wont
be
for
lack
of
contribut
by
viola
so
who
care
i
dont
see
whi
peopl
expect
boston
to
finish
sixth
the
bottom
four
team
last
year
were
essenti
tie
boston
in
seventh
place
had
win
the
yanke
and
indian
tie
for
fourth
place
had
win
now
i
should
think
it
is
obviou
that
the
red
sox
improv
more
than
the
indian
or
tiger
basic
the
red
sox
are
stronger
thi
year
at
b
dh
s
lf
and
rf
they
have
healthier
start
pitcher
so
far
at
least
and
better
reliev
i
see
no
reason
whi
they
shouldnt
win
game
meanwhil
the
indian
are
in
shambl
and
the
tiger
still
have
no
pitch
they
will
win
some
blowout
but
they
will
lose
an
aw
lot
of
game
too
mayb
the
sox
will
play
poorli
win
game
and
finish
fifth
but
i
think
third
or
fourth
place
is
more
like
cheer
