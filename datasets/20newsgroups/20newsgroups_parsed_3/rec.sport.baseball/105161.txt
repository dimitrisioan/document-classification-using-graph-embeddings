of
all
time
a
far
a
anyon
can
tell
i
did
a
quick
scan
last
night
look
for
player
with
a
peak
compar
to
or
better
than
winfield
in
my
quickndirti
subject
judgement
you
could
make
good
case
for
ruth
aaron
ott
robinson
clement
kalin
mari
klein
jackson
waner
and
probabl
a
few
other
thi
is
not
a
knock
on
winfield
but
a
comment
on
hi
consist
all
of
those
other
player
had
awesom
stretch
and
veri
good
stretch
while
winfield
ha
been
more
uniformli
excel
hall
of
fame
absolut
top
peak
im
not
so
sure
top
total
career
valu
ye
almost
certainli
point
taken
when
wa
winfield
peak
year
anyway
probabl
around
that
the
troubl
what
peak
year
he
waver
between
excel
and
veri
good
with
no
real
bellshap
pattern
in
there
wa
a
fine
year
and
were
mere
realli
good
with
the
yanke
i
think
wa
the
best
that
wa
the
one
with
the
ba
of
cours
wasnt
bad
either
he
been
in
the
big
sinc
with
a
oneyear
intermiss
for
surgeri
though
he
doesnt
have
the
mix
of
skill
that
pete
rose
did
he
like
pete
rose
in
one
way
he
not
a
natur
hitter
winfield
swing
use
to
be
the
ugliest
thing
in
new
york
and
that
includ
the
gulfwestern
build
but
hi
sheer
athlet
prowess
and
physic
size
made
up
for
a
lot
fascin
player
to
watch
even
now
not
obvious
great
in
ani
one
way
but
abl
to
do
quit
a
few
thing
in
surpris
way
and
at
surpris
level
