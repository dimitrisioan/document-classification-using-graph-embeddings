write
some
folk
like
to
argu
about
theoret
detail
i
prefer
to
watch
team
win
when
the
giant
slip
to
third
then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrang
the
bat
order
until
then
i
think
it
stupid
to
focu
on
what
wrong
for
the
simpl
fact
that
it
work
a
it
is
thi
is
a
fine
strategi
if
you
expect
to
run
away
with
the
divis
but
the
giant
are
go
to
need
everi
break
they
can
get
if
they
want
too
hold
that
lead
i
dont
think
they
can
afford
to
be
lackadais
and
say
well
it
ha
work
pretti
well
so
far
and
while
we
might
be

the
result
we
dont
think
it
is
worth

risk
mostli
though
the

are
win

frankli

continu
it
rather
silli

evid

would
