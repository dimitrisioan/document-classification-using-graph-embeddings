nobodi
say
it
a
hard
and
fast
rule
my
point
is
that
white
player
are
like
to
stick
around
longer
if
theyr
mediocr
i
went
through
tb
iii
and
made
a
list
of
year
of

b
who
were
neg
in
both
adjust
bat
run
and
total
player
rate
tpr
ha
some
problem
but
it
gener
not
too
far
off
for
a
career
imho
all
player
who
play
most
of
their
career
after
were
consid
here

a
few
black
player
there
a
lot
of
white
and
hispan
hmmmone
questionhow
do
you
differenti
hispan
and
black
after
all
some
peopl
fall
into
both
categoriesrafael
ramiriez
come
to
mindand
hed
fit
into
thi
group
also
oopsh
not
an
ofbalthough
he
is
a
lighthit
util
player
sorri
about
that
but
miguel
dilon
would
qualifi
if
i
rememb
correctli
when
i
say
black
i
mean
usborn
black
peopl
for
the
purpos
of
thi
discus
hispan
player
were
in
basebal
befor
and
one
team
in
the
s
sign
lot
of
hispan
becaus
they
went
over
better
with
the
local
audienc
than
black
did
and
whi
would
more
hispan
stick
around
than
black
dont
know
but
rememb
thi
is
the
countri
that
had
special
racial
law
for
one
group
and
one
group
onli
black
our
nation
histori
includ
huge
longterm
global
tension
regard
the
black
minor
the
hispan
minor
while
often
discrimin
against
ha
never
been
the
object
of
nation
ob
it
might
also
be
worth
your
while
to
subdivid
the
data
into
career
start
at
year
interv
i
would
think
that
your
predict
would
be
most
true
for
career
start
in
the
s
and
least
true
for
career
start
in
the
s
of
cours
youd
also
have
to
compar
total
ml
racial
percentag
for
the
era
in
question
absolut
a
i
said
befor
i
expect
that
thi
effect
is
disappear
but
it
certainli
did
exist
and
all
out
talk
of
twg
and
all
that
is
not
without
some
small
reason
im
of
the
opinion
that
your
point
is
le
valid
today
than
it
wa
year
ago
but
i
would
be
curiou
to
see
the
data
well
there
the
list
go
for
it
ill
cull
some
more
name
a
i
go
i
expect
your
right
btw
