where
you
are
obvious
dead
wrong
not
sinc
the
yanke
of
the
s
and
s
ha
a
team
been
so
nice
setup
a
thi
yearsand
year
to
come
brave
i
dont
think
that
the
allstar
team
will
be
abl
to
beat
thi
may
be
an
appropri
comparison
the
yanke
finsh
nd
rd
and
nd
finsh
and
game
out
of
first
in
and
they
also
finish
second
though
they
were
onli
and
game
out
even
great
team
can
lose
that
whi
they
play
the
season
on
the
other
hand
im
still
pick
the
brave
to
go
all
the
way
um
sure
you
didnt
intend
to
compar
the
red
with
the
philidelphia
a
the
yanke
were
finish
nd
to
a
team
that
wa
a
good
a
the
yanke
while
the
yanke
had
age
some
from
their
peak
year
ruth
and
gehrig
couldnt
play
everi
posit
simultan
imo
given
the
variou
age
of
the
brave
and
red
thi
season
that
the
brave
will
be
closer
to
their
peak
while
the
red
have
slightli
pas
their
peak
also
if
your
go
to
compar
brave
and
yanke
a
more
appropri
comparison
to
the
brave
might
be
the
