for
thi
also
i
just
notic
someth
look
at
the
nolan
ryan
timelin
in
the
preview
on
rickey
henderson
becam
nolan
th
strikeout
on
he
pitch
hi
th
nohitt
against
oakland
i
believ
the
last
out
in
the
game
wa
made
by
rickey
henderson
and
on
nolan
pitch
hi
th
nohitt
on
the
same
day
a
certain
someon
stole
hi
th
base
which
overshadow
it
it
seem
that
nolan
is
have
a
lot
of
public
at
rickey
expens
imo
rickey
deserv
it
and
it
seem
a
most
of
the
net
agre
with
me
from
what
ive
seen
on
it
late
they
are
both
great
player
but
imo
nolan
ha
outclass
rickey
both
in
play
and
more
importantli
in
attitud
just
my
thought
