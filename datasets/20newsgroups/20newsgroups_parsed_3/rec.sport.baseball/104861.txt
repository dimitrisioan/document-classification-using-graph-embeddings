th
i
like
the

order
pitcher
can
onli
walk
clark
with
out
unlik
last
year
william
is
get
better
pitch
to
hit
with
bond
loom
in
the
ondeck
circl
sinc
matt
ha
a
terribl
bat
eye
thi
help
the
giant
a
lot
when
bond
get
on
base
all
by
himself
he
can
tri
to
steal
nd
and
then
be
driven
in
with
a
singl
by
thompson
manwar
or
clayton
if
you
bat
bond
befor
the
other
slugger
then
you
dont
want
him
to
run
becaus
a
caught
steal
could
take
you
out
of
a
big
inning
also
bond
is
le
in
need
of
protect
behind
him
becaus
he
is
such
a
good
base
stealer
a
walk
is
a
potenti
doubl
the
onli
draw
back
is
when
clark
and
william
are
clog
up
the
base
infront
of
bond
and
i
think
that
a
problem
the
giant
will
be
glad
to
