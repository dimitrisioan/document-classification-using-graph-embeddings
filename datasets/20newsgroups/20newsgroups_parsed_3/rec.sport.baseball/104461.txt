is
a
team
that

no
talent
and
come
out
of
nowher
to
contend
the
met
and
oriol
are
prime
exampl
not
the
cub
sorri
but
it
is
virtual
imposs
to
win
a
divis
with
no
talent
over
game
i
would
amend
your
definit

peopl
who
didnt
even

theyd
win
a

let
alon
win
the

these
peopl
were
veri
silli
ani
team
that
get
to
the
world
seri
can
win
the

seri
and
anybodi
who
ever
expect
a
sweep
is
crazi
if
you
put
the
best
team
in
basebal
in
the
seri
against
the
worst
team
in

the
worst
team
would
win
at

a
game
most
of

time
and
veri
