ive
combin
those
with
my

mlv
number
to
come
up
with
firstapproxim
total
run
valu
for
player
last
year
we
can
use
these
a
a
springboard
for
reconsider
of
the
mvp
award
major
caveat
these
number
includ
no
defens
park
adjust
so
if
san
diego
realli
is
just
a
question
of
odd
score
or
gopher
hole
in
the
infield
that
will
caus
some
inaccuraci
the
offens
number
are
positionadjust
but
not
park
adjust
so
we
have
to
deflat
some
and
inflat
other
to
be
fair
final
we
still
dont
know
what
to
do
about
catcher
and
i
have
no
idea
how
to
evalu
the
defens
contribut
of
toni
phillip
and
bip
robert
have
said
that
there
are
still
some
surpris
let
look

grace
a
i
see
it
these
are
the
legitim
mvp
candid
from
last
season
if
you
deflat
sandberg
offens
a
wee
bit
for
play
in
wrigley
you
get
essenti
a
dead
heat
had
bond
been
hi
usual
defens
self
it
wouldnt
have
been
close
but
that
appar
wasnt
the
case
darren
daulton
need
or
more
defens
run
to
make
up
the
offens
differ
and
i
couldnt
tell
you
whether
that
easi
or
imposs
a
good
case
could
be
made
for
ani
of
sandberg
bond
or
daulton
a
top
dude
my
person
vote
bond
sandberg
daulton
walker
justic
in
the
american
leagu

ok
let
see
a
show
of
hand
how
mani
of
you
pick
robin
ventura
a
top
player
in
the
al
last
year
i
certainli
didnt
but
id
have
a
hard
time
argu
against
him
at
thi
point
ye
i
know
these
number
are
onli
approxim
but
that
a
big
gap
between
him
and
the
guy
also
those
of
you
who
thought
rickey
henderson
stank
last
year
are
out
of
your
mind
onc
again
there
a
catcher
in
the
ointment
if
call
a
game
is
a
import
a
it
might
be
run
is
easi
to
make
up
or
give
away
take
a
guess
folk
i
dont
think
we
can
do
ani
better
than
that
my
person
vote
exclud
pitcher
ventura
tettleton
anderson
martinez
henderson
im
a
big
frank
thoma
fan
but
i
have
to
admit
to
a
bia
in
favor
of
balanc
offensivedefens
contribut
which
should
have
a
higher
leverag
in
wl
record
than
an
equal
shift
that
is
lot
of
offens
with
neg
defens
for
the
record
carlo
baerga
roberto
alomar
forget
it
it
a
wash
let
me
also
take
thi
opportun
to
admit
that
i
wa
grossli
wrong
regard
don
mattingli
defens
thi
past

don
recov
brilliantli
from

weak
and
to
