re
jack
morri
roger
maynard
write
we
have
no
way
of
know
becaus
we
can
not
separ
morri
contribu
tion
from
the
rest
of
the
team
there
is
onli
one
way
of
determin
ing
best
in
basebal
and
that
is
by
look
at
the
scoreboard
at
the
end
of
the
game
each
game
determin
which
team
is
the
best
that
day
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
team
that
wa
the
best
the
most
often
is
the
best
in
the
divis
the
playoff
determin
the
best
of
the
best
but
the
point
is
that
the
onli
decis
make
pro
ce
use
to
determin
the
best
is
the
score
of
the
game
and
it
re
late
to
the
team
not
the
individu
player
there
is
no
method
inher
in
basebal
of
compar
individu
perform
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
becaus
after
all
basebal
is
a
team
game
and
you
know
what
there
is
no
such
method
inher
in
real
life
either
so
i
would
assum
you
would
endors
the
notion
that
we
can
not
state
with
ani
level
of
object
that
mother
theresa
ha
accomplish
more
good
in
thi
world
than
joseph
stalin
after
all
life
on
earth
is
a
team
effort
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statist
and
claim
that
clemen
ha
done
better
with
those
statist
a
a
criterion
then
fine
but
you
have
to
be
abl
to
prove
that
those
statist
measur
the
individu
contribut
to
win
the
w
becaus
that
is
the
onli
measur
of
best
that
ha
ani
mean
in
the
context
of
base
ball
so
until
you
can
prove
that
clemen
contribut
to
a
w
cham
pionship
more
than
morri
your
evalu
of
clemen
is
total
sub
jectiv
and
is
mere
opinion
i
have
yet
to
see
that
ani
of
you
can
predict
a
w
winner
with
ani
greater
accuraci
than
jeann
dixon
have
you
tri
glass
i
find
them
quit
use
after
all
there
must
be
some
reason
you
choos
to
ignor
the
mound
of
evid
we
present
it
too
bad
you
feel
it
necessari
to
close
your
mind
and
eye
to
knowledg
you
live
a
poorer
life
a
a
result
of
that
choic
heck
id
wager
that
you
could
predict
a
w
winner
with
greater
accuraci
than
jeann
dixon
and
you
know
whi
becaus
i
have
full
confid
that
despit
your
protest
to
the
contrari
you
are
quit
capabl
of
use
the
knowledg
we
can
come
up
with
through
statist
method
to
boost
your
knowledg
level
you
dont
have
to
be
rude
have
you
tri
call
a
kettl
black
for
you
to
say
that
mean
that
you
have
either
miss
the
entir
point
of
my
argument
or
you
yourself
have
commit
a
fallaci
ignoratio
elenchi
i
am
not
say
that
morri
is
better
than
clemen
becaus
he
ha
more
ring
although
i
have
tongu
in
cheek
claim
that
in
the
past
i
am
say
that
it
is
imposs
to
isol
an
individu
perform
from
that
of
hi
team
for
the
purpos
of
compar
that
individu
perform
with
anoth
individu
per
formanc
in
other
word
in
your
world
you
can
not
object
state
that
jack
morri
wa
more
import
to
the
blue
jay
than
al
leiter
last
year
in
your
world
that
may
inde
be
true
fortun
in
the
world
the
rest
of
u
occupi
it
not
i
hope
you
never
serv
on
a
juri
roger
i
think
the
rest
of
the
juri
would
have
to
kill
you
there
no
way
i
can
object
judg
the
defend
to
be
innoc
or
guilti
you
see
there
are
billion
other
peopl
on
thi
planet
we
have
no
way
of
know
whether
the
defend
would
have
commit
the
crime
if
it
wasnt
for
all
the
other
peopl
on
the
planet
we
have
no
way
of
know
how
the
defend
would
have
act
had
he
been
on
a
differ
planet
becaus
live
on
thi
planet
is
a
team
effort
and
no
individu
committ
a
crime
total
isol
from
hi
societi
he
is
a
part
of
that
societi
that
be
case
anyth
i
have
to
say
on
hi
culpabl
would
be
absolut
subject
so
i
refus
to
vote
