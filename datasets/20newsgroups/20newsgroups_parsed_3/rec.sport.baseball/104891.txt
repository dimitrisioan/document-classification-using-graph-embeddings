i
do
have

do
my

they
say
some

rather
they
show
quit
convincingli
that
past

ha
never
been

or
compel
testimoni
that
samuel
would
have
gotten
a
base
hit
im
sure
there
is
someth
wrong
with
the
sampl
size
or
that
the
basic
assumpt
that
clutch
perform
is
random
invalid
ani
conclus
from

limit
applic
or
someth
or
other
i
dont
pretend
to
understand
statist
analysi
well
we
agre
on
the
last
part
one
of
the
basic
thing
you
need
to
have
in
a
statist
to
be
abl
to
predict
a
player
perform
on
it
in
the
futur
is
for
there
to
be
a
correl
from
year
to
year
a
player
bat
averag
is
correl
fairli
well
from
year
to
year
a
player
abil
to
walk
or
infield
defens
averag
are
correl
better
that
is
to
say
given
their
past
perform
in
those
statist
we
can
have
a
pretti
good
handl
on
how
theyll
do
next
year
put
in
some
simpl
inform
about
age
and
you
can
do
even
better
one
of
the
basic
problem
with
someth
like
clutch
bat
averag
overal
bat
averag
is
that
the
correl
from
year
to
year
is
almost
zero
ad
to
the
sampl
size
doesnt
seem
to
help
much
a
a
counterexampl
to
what
you
show
consid
the
follow
two
player
from
nonclutch
clutch
ab

ab
h
ba
maldonado
lemon
if
you
had
had
these
two
player
in
by
your
logic
in
those
clutch
situat
youd
bat
maldonado
for
lemon
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
well
in
maldonado
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
while
lemon
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
befor
you
accus
me
of
complet
cook
the
data
there
were
player
who
had

everi

from
accord
to

a
a
simpl
measur
of
clutch
let
just
look
at
clutch
banonclutch

if
you
use
to

for
those
player
youd
find
that
of
the

in
that
measur
both

the

if
you

youd
expect
to
