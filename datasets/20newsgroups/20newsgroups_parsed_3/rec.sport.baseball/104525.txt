from
bobbi
davi
write
nohal
mcrae
is
the
worst
manag
in
basebal
i
havent
seen
enough
royal
game
to
judg
hi
tactic
so
you
may
have
a
point
here
but
ive
never
seen
a
guy
who
can
wast
talent
like
he
can
one
of
the
best
rawtal
staff
in
the
leagu
and
he
still
find
a
way
to
lose
imo
the
royal
dont
have
a
chanc
to
win
the
pennant
even
if
mcrae
suddenli
began
channel
for
john
mcgraw
ok
they
have
some
decent
pitcher
but
when
your
offens
consist
of
bum
like
gagn
and
lind
and
mcreynold
and
mcrae
and
an
overthehil
brett
your
not
go
to
finish
unless
mcgraw
bring
christi
mathewson
back
with
him
id
say
it
is
hard
to
evalu
a
manag
when
all
of
hi
hitter
suck
