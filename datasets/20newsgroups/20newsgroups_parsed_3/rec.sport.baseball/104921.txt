a
team
that
got
off
to
an
start
im
just
not
use
to
an
overli
enthusiast
houston
fan
i
realli
shouldnt

so
hang

lumberjack
but
get
ahold
of

the
new

drayton
mclain
sp
doesnt
particularli
like
excus
an
item
in
our
paper
the
austin
americanstatesman
if
you
read
it
here
it
wa
somewher
els
first
said
that
he
wouldnt
take
injuri
a
an
excus
for
lose
becaus
that
possibl
should
have
been
account
for
uh
oh
i
dont
want
an
owner
thatll
keep
everybodi
on
edg
id
never
gotten
that
feel
about
him
but
who
know
doe
to
be
honest
i
think
the
citi
of
houston
love
the
new
owner
he
ha
brought
basebal
back
to
houston
with
key
acquisit
player
that
were
from
the
houston
area
and
want
to
play
for
the
astro
i
dont
think
that
too
mani
peopl
are
fear
that
mclane
will
meddl
in
the
team
a
he
ha
alreadi
admit
that
he
doesnt
know
a
whole
lot
about
basebal
mclane
is
a
businessman
and
doesnt
like
excus
he
make
a
valid
point
that
injuri
shouldnt
be
an
excus
to
thi
club
look
at
the
depth
of
the
bench
thi
season
canadel
can
play
posit
bass
and
jame
are
solid
outfield
and
can
hit
well
too
urib
is
nice
to
have
a
well
the
pitch
staff
ha
legitim
starter
were
deal
with
a
young
houston
team
so
injuri
shouldnt
play
a
big
role
the
onli
threat
is
the
bullpen
if
jonesi
go
out
we
may
be
in
troubl
but
with
the
type
of
starter
we
have
thi
season
there
is
le
pressur
on
