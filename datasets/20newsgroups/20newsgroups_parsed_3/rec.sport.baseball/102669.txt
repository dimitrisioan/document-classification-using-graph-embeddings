young
catcher
mark
singer
said
in
articl
david
m
tate
write
well
perhap
if
the
brave
had
no
one
el
worth
play
thi
year
it
would
be
lopez
in
there
but
they
do
have
other
worth
play
at
least
in
their
opinion
catcher
is
their
weakest
posit
with
the
possibl
except
of
second
base
they
have
a
chanc
to
simultan
replac
their
biggest
offens
problem
spot
with
a
wellaboveaverag
offens
player
and
acclim
a
highli
promis
potenti
star
with
no
pressur
on
him
to
carri
the
team
and
they
want
to
play
olson
and
berryhil
instead
i
disagre
in
that
i
dont
think
it
is
a
tangibl
skill
ani
more
than
leadership
is
i
dont
deni
that
it
is
a
real
skill
and
that
some
catcher
may
be
much
better
than
other
at
it
but
i
realli
dont
see
ani
way
that
we
could
ever
know
who
they
are
nicholss
law
of
catcher
defens
is
eerili
accur
far
too
often
for
me
to
take
defens
ass
of
catcher
veri
serious
sorri
new
dont
know
nichol
law
a
catcher
defens
reput
will
be
invers
proport
to
hi
recent
offens
level
of
perform
thu
mickey
tettleton
goe
in
the
medium
from
be
a
nohit
defens
whiz
to
a
slug
thumbfing
in
two
short
year
the
rule
doesnt
appli
to
perceiv
superstar
who
get
the
gold
glove
offens
transfer
effect
instead
greg
olson
is
probabl
consid
to
be
a
good
defens
catcher
precis
becaus
he
cant
hit
dont
believ
in
catcher
era
but
i
am
interest
in
pitcher
era
with
differ
catcher
arent
they
the
same
thing
in
other
word
we
know
more
than
they
do
so
the
onli
logic
behind
a
differ
decis
than
we
would
make
must
be
financi
either
that
or
just
stupid
i
presum
we
feel
thi
way
about
other
franchis
than
atlanta
no
of
cours
is
it
fair
to
the
young
player
no
doe
it
make
organiz
sen
i
think
it
doe
well
if
it
doe
make
organiz
sen
one
can
hardli
fault
them
for
their
decis
i
mean
plea
dont
tell
me
how
to
run
my
busi
especi
when
im
be
success
one
could
make
the
same
sort
of
argument
in
other
