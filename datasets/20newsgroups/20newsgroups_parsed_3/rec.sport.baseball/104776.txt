ive
suffer
with
all
kind
of
insult

typic
for
the
net
but
give
me
a
break
galarraga
is
current
bat
over
and
you
guy
are
complain
that
he
isnt
draw
enough
walk
what
would
he
have
to
do
to
plea
you
guy
bat
you
can
hardli
claim
that
he
is
hurt
hi
team
fine
are
you
will
to
bet
that
he
will
bat
the
rest
of
the
way
the
point
is
that
he
ha
hurt
the
rocki
so
far
it
that
he
will
hurt
them
eventu
just
a
much
a
he
hurt
the
expo
and
the
cardin
the
past
coupl
season
if
it
happen
that
the
pitcher
start
throw
him
fewer
good
pitch
and
he
start
make
lot
of
out
a
someon
specul
might
happen
then
i
would
agre
with
you
that
he
isnt
take
enough
pitch
my
comment
it
ha
happen
for
the
past
season
where
have
you
been
that
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
doesnt
mean
that
he
should
have
a
licens
to
swing
at
bad
pitch
and
make
out
it
more
along
the
line
of
he
bat
and
lead
the
leagu
in
rbi
so
what
bloodi
differ
doe
it
make
if
he
isnt
draw
a
lot
of
walk
