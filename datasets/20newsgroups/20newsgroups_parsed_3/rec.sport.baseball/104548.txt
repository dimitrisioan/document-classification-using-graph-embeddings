that
you
are
base
thi
statement
on

thi
is

you
say
that
alomar
wa
the
better
hitter
last
year
and
immedi
follow
that
up
with
number
show
that
baerga
had
a
better
year
the
onli
categori
that
i
see
which
show
an
advantag
for
alomar
is
obp
hmmmwhat
about
walk
and
sb
baerga
got
clobber
by
alomar
in
obp
and
beat
him
in
slg
by
a
lesser
margin
even
put
asid
ani
other
factor
a
player
with
a
point
edg
in
obp
is
more
product
than
a

with
a

edg
in
slg
the
issu
ha
been
studi
befor
and
i
doubt
you
could
come
up
with
ani
convinc
argument
the
other
way
peopl
see
the
bat
averag
and
the
hr
but
they
dont
realli
know
their
valu
is
worth
unless
theyv
studi
the
issu
close
the
fact
is
that
baerga
ate
up
a
lot
more
out
than
alomar
while
baerga
wa
make
out
alomar
wa
