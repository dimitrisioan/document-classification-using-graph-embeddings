sigh
here
we
go
again
actual
sever
scdn
state
that
there
were
no
defin
skill
that
would
make
a
hitter
more
like
to
perform
better
in
clutch
situat
v
nonclutch
situat
howev
one
might
choos
to
defin
clutch
right
can
you
defin
such
a
skill
must
i
if
i
were
to
say
that
bat
averag
is
a
predictor
that
can
be
use
to
judg
which
of
two
hitter
is
more
like
to
get
a
hit
on
a
particular
plate
appear
is
that
onli
valid
if
i
can
defin
the
skill
in
hit
a
basebal
that
all
ive
said
except
i
use
the
smaller
sampl
of
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
and
elsewher
on
thi
thread
sherri
nichol
repeat
her
posit
that
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
is
a
meaningless
statist
for
predict
the
futur
it
ha
been
entir
meaningless
at
least
if
it
ha
mean
we
dont
know
how
to
find
it
i
did
not
say
i
could
predict
the
futur
ive
suggest
that
the
statist
is
not
necessarili
meaningless
here
the
data
for
thi
situat
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
sabo
samuel
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
red
manag
at
that
time
i
assum
you
would
have
had
some
basi
for
let
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hit
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basi
would
have
util
prior
perform
you
just
wouldnt
have
use
thi
particular
aspect
of
prior
perform
is
thi
not
correct
ill
tri
to
avoid
be
insult
but
it
difficult
when
you
so
cavalierli
dismiss
hundr
of
hour
of
work
with
an
i
dont
pretend
to
understand
but
nobodi
is
deni
that
there
are
peopl
who
have
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
past
but
i
challeng
you
to
find
a
method
to
predict
who
will
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
futur
which
after
all
is
what
you
are
claim
you
can
do
sinc
one
more
time
i
did
not
claim
to
be
abl
to
predict
the
futur
i
said
that
i
accept
the
abov
data
a
an
indic
that
samuel
would
have
had
a
better
chanc
for
success
in
that
situat
than
sabo
and
i
am
not
dismiss
your
work
im
state
my
opinion
you
are
say
that
your
work
render
ani
opinion
to
the
contrari
invalid
so
that
the
retent
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your
work
fine
we
have
plenti
of
data
obvious
our
preconceiv
bia
must
be
color
our
work
sinc
you
know
clutch
hit
is
a
welldefin
and
consist
skill
all
of
our
failur
notwithstand
so
i
challeng
you
to
prove
it
i
guarante
you
that
if
you
can
prove
the
exist
of
some
form
of
clutch
abil
you
will
have
plenti
of
happi
sdcn
danc
around
you
i
did
not
say
that
clutchhit
is
well
defin
i
said
that
the
data
is
signific
to
me
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consist
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indic
of
perform
under
a
certain
set
of
circumst
but
you
arent
go
to
win
ani
support
by
mere
state
a
posit
and
claim
they
are
stupid
so
i
must
be
right
and
big
sigh
i
have
not
not
not
not
not
not
not
ever
call
you
or
anyon
els
on
rsb
stupid
it
is
nice
howev
to
see
that
you
will
consid
the
possibl
that
you
actual
could
have
some
preconceiv
bia
yeah
hindsight
is
alway
doesnt
that
make
you
bright
thi
is
a
stupid
argument
and
you
know
it
ah
i
knew
we
could
get
to
the
name
call
and
there
that
word
you
like
so
much
a
suggest
take
data
from
and
attempt
to
come
up
with
some
method
that
predict
who
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
if
that
work
we
can
then
attempt
to
appli
it
to
and
beyond
wait
a
minut
i
thought
i
first
had
to
defin
clutch
hit
do
i
or
dont
i
you
have
made
strong
statement
now
back
them
up
or
be
proven
a
total
idiot
i
made
two
statement
in
my
post
i
am
not
convinc
of
your
conclus
regard
clutch
hit
i
would
have
hit
for
sabo
a
for
mani
of
u
make
a
number
of
written
statement
through
thi
medium
about
what
we
think
will
happen
in
basebal
im
not
shi
about
it
ill
make
the
statement
again
i
believ
that
by
season
end
that
chri
sabo
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
will
be
significantli
lower
than
hi
bat
averag
in
nonclutch
situat
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
here
anoth
one
for
you
in
joe
carter
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
wa
significantli
below
hi
bat
averag
in
nonclutch
situat
each
year
i
presum
you
think
thi
is
random
nonclutch
ab
h
clutch
ab
h
so
what
could
we
expect
in
from
mr
carter
well
hi
composit
ba
through
wa
through
wa
through
wa
so
i
think
we
have
a
pretti
good
idea
of
what
kind
of
bat
averag
he
can
produc
in
he
hit
not
surpris
huh
also
in
nonclutch
ab
h
clutch
ab
h
no
thi
doesnt
prove
ani
overal
statist
trend
that
can
be
use
to
predict
futur
perform
across
the
breadth
of
major
leagu
ballplay
it
just
make
me
think
that
in
joe
carter
bat
averag
in
the
clutch
is
not
go
to
be
a
high
a
hi
ba
in
nonclutch
situat
a
for
abov
i
have
plenti
of
compani
john
dewan
of
statsinc

of
the
scout

wherein
the
statist
regard

and
referenc
in
the
text
bill
jame
make
numer
refer
to
a
player
abil
to
hit
well
in
the
clutch
i
am
not
say
that
i
can
predict
the
futur
ani
more
than
they
are
you
and
other
are
say
that
your
work
render
their
statement
and
mine
meaningless
i
dont
accept
that
which
in
your
word
prof
that
i
am
a
total
