you
dont

what
perez
had
in
mind
when
he
left
sabo
in
by
support
the
swap
you
are
predict
the
opposit
in
fact
i
dont
think
anyon
is
claim
that
they
can
predict
the
futur
or
ani
particular
futur
event
but
we
can
believ
that
certain
trend
are
due

a
caus
whether
or
not
we
have
identifi
the
caus
and
therefor
will
continu
and
i
am
not
dismiss
your
work
im
state
my
opinion
you
are
say
that
your
work
render
ani
opinion
to
the
contrari
invalid
so
that
the
retent
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your
work
well
ye
you
are
awar
of
it
exist
you
claim
to
be
incap
of
understand
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simpli
unwil
yet
you
rather
forc
state
the
opposit
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
read
yet
you
obvious
feel
the
topic
is
import
id
say
thi
is
insult
i
think
see
insult
in
other
peopl
opinion
is
kind
of
silli
after
all
mark
didnt
call
you
a
total
idiot
or
call
your
work
stupid
he
simpli
state
that
it
didnt
chang
hi
opinion
on
the
subject
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consist
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indic
of
perform
under
a
certain
set
of
circumst
right
thi
is
the
beef
it
ha
not
proven
to
be
an
indic
of
futur
perform
under
ani
circumst
at
least
none
that
weve
been
abl
to
come
up
with
if
you
know
of
some
where
it
is
an
indic
of
futur
perform
pleas
let
u
in
on
your
secret
if
player
a
hit
better
on
tuesday
and
alway
ha
and
mark
belief
that
it
might
be
an
indic
that
he
will
hit
on
tuesday
better
next
season
a
well
would
you
respond
the
same
way
at
some
point
you
might
admit
that
all
variabl
might
not
be
known
to
you
who
know
what
thi
guy
doe
everi
monday
night
mayb
he
see
hi
sport
shrink
on
tuesday
morn
or
ha
hi
vitamin
b
shot
monday
night
but
thi
is
someth
that
true
of
one
guy
onli
it
doesnt
mean
that
there
will
be
a
meaning
correl
for
the
entir
leagu
by
day
of
the
week
nor
that
there
should
be
but
it
doesnt
mean
we
cant
make
predict
base
on
that
for
that
particular
player
i
believ
that
by
season
end
that
chri
sabo
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
will
be
significantli
lower
than
hi
bat
averag
in
nonclutch
situat
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
thi
simpli
a
predict
for
chri
sabo
for
thi
year
or
is
thi
a
predict
for
all
batter
who
have
over
the
past
few
year
hit
xxx
amount
wors
in
the
clutch
than
overal
i
onli
see
a
predict
for
one
player
here
i
dont
see
anyth
about
all
batter
here
anoth
one
for
you
in
joe
carter
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
wa
significantli
below
hi
bat
averag
in
nonclutch
situat
each
year
i
presum
you
think
thi
is
random
im
not
go
to
get
into
case
analysi
sure
you
can
find
somebodi
who
hit
poorli
from
and
then
hit
poorli
in
a
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorli
from
and
then
hit
well
in
that
exactli
what
mark
is
tri
to
do
though
find
hitter
that
have
these
correl
and
ask
whether
we
can
make
predict
for
these
hitter
base
on
their
past
perform
major
leagu
ballplay
it
just
make
me
think
that
in
joe
carter
bat
averag
in
the
clutch
is
not
go
to
be
a
high
a
hi
ba
in
nonclutch
situat
gambler
fallaci
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consist
a
huh
what
doe
gambler
fallaci
have
to
do
with
anyth
whether
you
can
know
the
reason
for
correl
or
not
you
cant
deni
that
it
ha
exist
you
can
onli
make
an
argument
that
you
dont
think
it
is
like
to
continu
to
exist
becaus
you
cant
see
a
reason
for
it
to
exist
run
prof
noth
can
you
give
u
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correl
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detail
studi
of
someon
post
recent
on
whi
neg
clutch
would
correl
the
argument
along
the
line
of
star
player
with
lr
split
will
alway
see
an
advers
condit
in
late
inning
of
a
close
game
ie
oppos
manag
will
alway
bring
in
a
ah
pitcher
to
face
him
where
hi
manag
will
not
pull
him
for
a
ph
i
dont
see
how
you
can
deni
it
a
for
total
idiot
ye
if
you
prove
yourself
unwil
to
even
consid
evid
that
might
suggest
that
you
are
wrong
i
would
say
the
term
fit
nice
so
tell
me
doe
the
term
fit
or
do
you
have
an
open
mind
what
about
you
if
the
shoe
fit
will
you
wear
it
with
an
open
mind
