to
death
but
i
havent
seen
anyth
in
rsb
yet
gerald
perri
of
the
cardin
pinch
hit
in
the
eighth
inning
with
two
on
and
hi
club
down
by
a
run
he
stroke
a
line
drive
into
the
right
field
corner
the
ball
clear
the
threefoot
high
fenc
and
went
into
the
crowd
darryl
race
over
from
right
center
got
to
the
spot
in
time
to
reach
hi
glove
up
over
the
short
fenc
but
he
miss
the

a
fan
sit
in
the
front
row
wear
a
mitt
reach
up
and
caught
the
ball
home
run
now
ive
seen
the
replay
sever
time
and
i
have
conclud
that
darryl
miss
the
ball
and
that
the
fan
glove
wa
essenti
behind
darryl
sever
dodger
fan
with
seat
in
the
immedi
vicin
have
claim
that
the
fan
unquestion
interf
with
strawberri
what
can
not
be
disput
howev
is
that
the
fan
who
caught
the
ball
never
took
hi
eye
off
it
he
wa
oblivi
to
where
the
fielder
wa
play
he
wa
also
quit
exuber
a
soon
a
he
realiz
he
had
made
the
catch
stuff
about
daryl
and
tommi
and
everyon
blame
fan
for
the
loss
delet
i
saw
the
replay
sever
time
too
no
question
about
it
daryl
miss
the
ball
then
the
fan
caught
it
daryl
is
so
tall
that
he
had
the
first
shot
at
the
ball
daryl
just
whine
again
i
think
it
show
a
lack
of
class
when
tommi
daryl
and
the
dodger
blame
a
singl
fan
for
lose
the
game
what
about
the
pitcher
who
threw
up
the
gopher
ball
what
about
the
pitcher
that
gave
up
run
up
to
that
point
sorri
tommi
if
it
were
a
game
and
daryl
wa
foot
inch
tall
then
mayb
just
mayb
youd
have
an
argument
