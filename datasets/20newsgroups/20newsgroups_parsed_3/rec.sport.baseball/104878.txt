i
suspect
that
split
such
a
these
are
the
result
of
posit
an
outfield
who
is
fast
and
get
a
good
jump
would
be
expect
to
catch
a
lot
of
ball
prevent
both
singl
and
doubl
and
also
cut
off
more
uncatch
ball
turing
doubl
into
singl
howev
a
fielder
who
play
shallow
will
catch
more
short
fli
and
fewer
long
fli
thi
mean
that
he
will
allow
fewer
singl
but
more
doubl
ha
anyon
seen
these
player
posit
do
butler
and
felix
play
deep
and
lankford
martinez
and
wilson
shallow
or
is
thi
a
park
effect
i
thought
butler
like
to
play
shallow
