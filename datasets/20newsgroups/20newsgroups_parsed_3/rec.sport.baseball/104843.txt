barri
is
such
an
awesom
and
consist
hitter
definit
the
best
in

leagu
imho
to
have
william
a
streaki
hitter
and
not
realli
a
clutch
hitter
bat
th
ahead

is
simpli
an
injustic

thi
make
it
tougher
for

chang
pitcher
have
bond
bat
behind
william
mean
that
matt
will
get
more
good

thi
is

sinc
he
struggl
so

oppos

both
your

are
not
good
one
joe
morgan
think
that
bondsclark
william
should
be
the
hitter
while
he
belief
that
clarkbond
william
is
fine
he
definit
is
of
the
opinion
that
bond
should
hit
ahead
of
william
i
am
inclin
to
agre
with
him
your
first
reason
is
not
valid
becaus
bond
can
hit
both
lefti
and
righti
veri
well
he
hit
lefti
or
righti
better
than
ani
other
giant
william
is
still
get
break
ball
although
not
a
much
a
last
season
but
the
bottom
line
is
bond
is
a
far
more
disciplin
and
more
product
hitter
than
william
and
i
prefer
to
take
my
chanc
with
bond
drive
in
the
or
hitter
who
are
expect
to
have
high
obp
than
with
william
william
would
get
more
fastbal
with
bond
on
first

second
base
open
becaus
of
the
threat
of
bond
