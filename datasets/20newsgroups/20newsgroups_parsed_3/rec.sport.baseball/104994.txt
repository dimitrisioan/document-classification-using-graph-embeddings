wade
bogg
i
live
in
boston
and
like
wade
a
lot
but
hi
career
is
wind
down
and
i
would
rather
see
the
yank
start
to
develop
a
long
term
solut
ie
hensley
muelin
ru
davi
velard
besid
wade
just
doesnt
have
ani
rang
what
a
shame
about
charli
hay
huh
who
would
you
have
play
b
wade
bogg
or
charli
hay
my
choic
is
bogg
no
contest
it
will
give
them
time
to
develop
younger
talent
in
an
area
the
yanke
farm
system
seem
to
be
defici
ahem
two
word
russel
davi
play
in
the
cavern
at
albani
aa
last
year
down
the
alley
and
to
center
davi
went
with
homer
there
arent
ani
small
park
on
the
road
in
the
eastern
leagu
either
he
and
hi
mle
wa
hr
i
have
no
field
statist
but
from
see
him
a
number
of
time
last
year
id
say
that
he
not
brook
robinson
but
neither
is
he
howard
johnson
unless
they
think
they
can
win
the
pennant
thi
year
which
seem
possibl
and
need
bogg
to
do
it
i
think
theyr
make
the
same
sort
of
mistak
with
davi
that
boston
made
with
bogg
leav
him
in
the
minor
for
two
or
three
year
after
hed
shown
that
he
wa
a
good
hitter
spike
owen
see
wade
bogg
id
much
rather
see
them
develop
dave
silvestri
or
whoever
wade
and
spike
next
to
each
other
in
the
infield
is
go
to
rais
the
yanke
staff
era
point
and
these
guy
are
on
the
down
side
of
their
career
too
bad
they
gave
up
on
randi
valard
too
mani
trip
on
the
columbu
shuttl
hrm
they
still
have
him
on
the
roster
ab
through
the
first
two
week
theyv
just
never
figur
out
what
to
do
with
him
i
suspect
that
he
hit
enough
especi
v
lefti
to
be
a
reason
shortstop
one
rumor
run
around
dure
spring
train
wa
that
they
want
to
convert
silvestri
to
be
a
catcher
becaus
hi
bodi
type
wa
wrong
for
a
shortstop
youd
think
that
somebodi
in
the
same
divis
who
play
baltimor
about
a
dozen
time
a
year
would
know
better
mike
jone
aix
highend
develop
if
one
of
our
guy
went
down
i
just
doubl
it
no
confus
there
it
didnt
requir
a
rhode
scholar
if
two
of
my
teammat
went
down
four
of
your
would
i
had
to
protect
my
guy
don
drysdal
in
regard
to
bogg
ill
relat
a
stori
about
a
yanke
fan
at
fenway
last
year
for
open
day
i
wa
there
to
see
them
face
baltimor
and
couldnt
help
but
listen
to
the
boston
fan
talk
about
variou
player
on
the
team
one
guy
wa
total
obliter
bogg
how
he
suck
etc
i
told
him
i
wa
a
yanke
fan
and
id
take
him
in
a
second
and
who
would
he
want
in
a
trade
back
he
said
a
pile
of
sht
i
know
bogg
had
some
person
problem
while
play
for
boston
but
come
on
he
a
futur
hall
of
famer
who
realli
add
a
need
dimens
to
the
yank
a
solid
hitter
a
decent
fielder
and
more
importantli
a
teacher
ask
pat
kelli
i
think
he
got
a
few
good
year
left
in
hi
bat
and
may
be
a
key
contributor
down
the
stretch
a
they
win
the
american
leagu
east
thi
year
boston
fan
have
no
class
theyll
probabl
boo
him
like
crazi
hi
first
time
back
in
pinstrip
and
i
hope
he
go
for
and
shut
them
up
