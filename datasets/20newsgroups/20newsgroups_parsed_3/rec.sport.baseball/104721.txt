delet
for
bandwidth
god
know
we
need
it
basebal
is
a
team
game
but
it
is
made
of
individu
talent
it
is
absurd
to
judg
the
success
or
failur
of
an
individu
by
the
success
or
failur
of
hi
teammat
whom
he
did
not
choos
at
least
in
most
case
morri
won
last
year
becaus
he
play
on
a
team
with
joe
carter
robbi
alomar
tom
henk
juan
guzman
john
olerud
et
al
clemen
lost
becaus
he
wa
surround
by
such
lesser
perform
a
herm
winninham
lui
rivera
and
jeff
reardon
to
defin
the
qualiti
of
the
team
a
a
sum
of
it
compon
a
i
do
albeit
imperfectli
is
a
lesser
error
than
defin
the
qualiti
of
an
individu
a
the
mean
qualiti
of
the
team
a
my
read
of
your
argument
suggest
you
do
no
i
am
not
tri
to
defin
the
qualiti
of
an
individu
at
least
not
for
the
purpos
of
rank
them
toronto
won
with
olerud
they
might
have
won
with
fielder
they
might
not
have
won
with
thoma
detroit
might
have
won
with
thoma
chicago
might
have
won
with
fielder
you
cant
rank
these
individu
you
can
onli
look
at
who
might
contribut
more
to
the
team
effort
which
is
win
the
w
thoma
could
not
have
contribut
to
that
goal
ani
more
than
olerud
so
i
can
not
say
that
olerud
is
le
of
a
player
ok
roger
here
a
question
for
you
say
you
are
run
an
expans
team
you
dont
have
a
team
at
the
moment
but
the
draft
is
come
up
who
are
you
go
to
pick
guy
who
have
won
the
most
w
ring
or
guy
who
could
contribut
the
most
to
your
team
say
the
red
were
dumb
enough
to
not
protect
larkin
and
the
jay
didnt
protect
alfredo
who
would
you
pick
i
cant
believ
im
get
involv
in
thi
john
cordial
a
alway
so
mani
moron
rm
and
so
littl
time
