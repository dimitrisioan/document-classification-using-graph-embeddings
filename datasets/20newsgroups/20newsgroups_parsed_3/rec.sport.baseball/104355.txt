brian

write
joe
torr
ha
to
be
the
worst
manag
in
basebal
he
not
the
greatest
thi
is
true
for
anyon
who
didnt
see
sunday
game
i
saw
it
with
a
right
hander
pitch
he
decid
to
bench
lankform
a
left
hand
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
hander
lankford
wa
hurt
although
the
announc
said
he
told
torr
he
could
pinch
hit
if
they
need
him
to
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
base
load
and
two
out
he
put
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
a
a
pinch
runner
and
use
lui
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
a
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
think
i
wonder
the
same
thing
but
give
joe
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
id
say
he
wa
think
that
lankford
is
hurt
enough
that
he
didnt
trust
hi
abil
to
bat
effect
but
he
want
hi
speed
on
the
base
so
pinch
run
him
alicea
i
wa
complet
confus
about
mayb
he
had
a
good
record
hit
against
that
particular
pitcher
i
dont
know
anybodi
got
an
idea
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquir
mark
whiten
he
comment
how
fortun
the
cardin
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
thi
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torr
said
he
like
gilkey
come
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
doe
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
start
on
most
everi
team
in
the
leagu
well
so
far
i
havent
seen
much
to
say
whiten
shouldnt
be
play
but
it
is
too
bad
that
gilkey
is
the
odd
man
out
when
they
play
jordan
ahead
of
him
that
i
dont
quit
understand
furthermor
in
sunday
game
when
lankford
wa
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
show
bucki
dent
the
third
base
coach
look
down
the
line
and
wave
lankford
home
yup
i
look
for
thi
on
the
replay
too
if
im
joe
torr
im
go
to
have
a
talk
with
bucki
after
the
game
on
that
one
he
got
lankford
at
third
with
todd
zeil
i
believ
a
hot
hitter
come
up
there
no
reason
to
risk
give
lankford
the
go
sign
in
that
situat
unless
he
wa
sure
the
ball
is
go
to
the
stand
it
hi
job
to
watch
the
play
develop
he
should
have
known
larkin
wa
there
to
back
up
a
bad
throw
that
seem
inexcus
in
my
book
btw
i
saw
dent
do
the
same
thing
last
year
with
zeil
round
third
and
go
into
a
sure
out
at
home
in
a
critic
situat
on
the
replay
there
dent
wave
him
around
it
look
like
thi
might
be
a
seriou
problem
the
card
werent
good
base
runner
at
all
last
year
and
i
wonder
how
much
of
the
fault
lie
in
the
base
coach
i
cant
take
thi
anymor
well
im
still
hang
in
there
go
