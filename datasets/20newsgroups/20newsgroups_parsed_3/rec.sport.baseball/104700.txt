a
reason
umpir
would
do
a
he
been
instruct

do
thi
season
get
the
batter
back
in
the
box
sooner
to
tri
to
cut
down
on
the
ridicul
length
of
game
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
thi
happen
i
agre
that
hirschbeck
wa
just
do
what
he
wa
instruct
to
do
and
also
that
gant
should
have
listen
to
him
howev
what
is
with
thi
polici
of
tri
to
speed
up
the
game
you
are
the
first
person
nonmediot
i
have
seen
endors
thi
polici
i
have
no
problem
with
the
length
of
game
at
all
and
am
tire
of
the
espn
crowd
and
other
announc
bitch
about
it
i
have
never
been
in
a
ballpark
fill
with
peopl
look
at
their
watch
and
shout
hurri
up
if
i
cough
up
big
buck
for
a
ticket
i
dont
mind
a
game
that
last
more
than
i
realli
dont
understand
it
game
are
longer
now
for
sever
reason
more
pitch
chang
more
basest
and
throw
to
first
etci
think
a
veri
small
factor
is
the
increas
time
it
take
jose
canseco
deion
sander
insert
fanci
showboat
ballplay
here
to
arrang
their
jewelri
prior
to
step
in
the
batter
box
my
impress
is
that
sportcast
and
writer
have
made
thi
an
issu
becaus
they
like
shorter
game
they
get
to
head
back
to
hotel
bar
eat
steak
get
drunk
tell
stupid
joke
with
their
pal
and
chase
stewardess
around
the
bar
sure
they
want
the
game
over
with
print
journalist
have
a
slightli
more
legitim
reason
for
want
faster
game
they
have
deadlin
the
espn
guy
on
basebal
tonight
drive
me
crazi
they
constantli
harp
on
thi
primarili
becaus
they
often
have
to
work
late
when
the
game
goe
longer
than
mayb
i
am
just
a
neerdowel
with
noth
better
to
do
but
i
would
like
to
hear
reason
whi
the
longer
game
upset
you
a

it

the
