re
jack
morri
in
articl
roger
maynard
write
not
at
all
i
am
talk
about
morri
win
with
toronto
last
year
you
are
about
to
launch
into
a
fantasi
about
the
red
jay
and
how
toronto
would
have
done
with
viola
on
their
team
viola
didnt
play
for
toronto
last
year
morri
did
the
problem
with
your
nihilist
approach
roger
is
that
it
take
all
the
sen
out
of
the
game
by
your
line
of
reason
if
a
guy
hit
into
a
doubl
play
with
one
out
and
the
base
load
there
no
point
in
say
that
that
wa
a
bad
thing
to
do
if
hi
team
won
anyway
or
specul
on
what
might
have
happen
if
thing
had
gone
otherwis
so
the
doubl
play
is
mere
an
event
that
happen
in
the
cours
of
a
game
that
wa
eventu
won
or
lost
for
unknown
reason
after
all
ani
specul
involv
construct
a
fantasi
about
what
would
have
happen
but
didnt
roger
do
you
ever
worri
that
the
next
pencil
you
drop
will
fall
to
the
ceil
instead
or
are
you
will
to
consid
empir
evid
team
go
to
the
postseason
when
they
win
more
game
than
anybodi
el
in
their
divis
if
they
dont
make
the
postseason
they
dont
win
the
seri
will
you
agre
that
win
a
divis
is
a
use
intermedi
goal
in
ringcollect
if
so
you
must
agre
that
win
game
is
a
use
intermedi
goal
toward
win
the
divis
and
our
disagr
come
when
we
consid
how
to
win
game
in
your
viewpoint
a
express
win
game
happen
for
reason
that
can
not
be
analyz
while
mani
of
u
are
think
thing
like
base
runner
are
good
out
are
bad
and
therefor
walk
are
better
than
doubl
play
with
the
base
load
you
are
think
thing
like
it
a
team
game
so
perhap
the
doubl
play
will
caus
some
mysteri
team
dynam
that
will
caus
the
team
to
win
today
the
result
is
that
it
becom
imposs
to
say
anyth
about
individu
player
perhap
atlanta
would
have
won
the
seri
with
me
play
left
field
after
all
perhap
in
some
way
my
knowledg
and
person
would
have
help
the
team
more
than
my
complet
lack
of
skill
would
have
hurt
it
therefor
i
could
be
an
extrem
valuabl
player
did
dave
winfield
have
anyth
to
do
with
the
jay
victori
probabl
but
how
do
you
know
if
you
replac
him
with
andr
galarraga
perhap
the
jay
would
have
won
perhap
they
would
have
lost
perhap
they
would
have
defect
to
alpha
centauri
bear
in
mind
that
the
fli
saucer
would
not
have
land
in
midseason
had
winfield
been
dhing
for
toronto
wa
babe
ruth
a
good
player
he
play
on
some
wswin
team
but
did
he
have
anyth
to
do
with
their
success
it
is
gener
accept
that
erni
bank
wa
a
good
basebal
player
and
jarvi
brown
and
dan
schatzed
werent
it
seem
to
me
that
anybodi
who
would
deni
thi
need
to
provid
the
proof
now
we
have
observ
thing
about
basebal
over
the
year
both
empir
and
by
look
at
the
rulebook
it
is
necessari
to
score
more
run
than
one
oppon
to
win
the
game
so
it
would
seem
import
to
score
run
and
to
prevent
one
oppon
from
score
run
are
score
while
a
team
is
bat
and
an
inning
end
after
the
third
out
so
it
would
seem
that
make
out
is
bad
while
hit
home
run
is
good
player
have
tendenc
to
hit
or
pitch
at
certain
level
and
these
are
usual
somewhat
consist
from
year
to
year
we
do
use
these
statist
to
predict
winner
and
so
do
you
to
make
some
flat
predict
barri
bond
will
have
a
higher
obpslg
than
gene
larkin
thi
year
the
brave
will
finish
ahead
of
the
rocki
in
the
stand
the
tiger
will
score
more
run
than
the
royal
but
will
also
give
up
more
i
would
be
astonish
if
ani
of
these
turn
out
to
be
fals
and
i
suspect
so
would
you
a
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
pretti
sure
i
can
predict
all
the
divis
winner
thi
year
given
guess
per
divis
and
thi
is
certainli
better
than
random
chanc
and
almost
statist
signific
if
you
will
admit
that
the
rocki
and
marin
are
unlik
to
meet
in
the
world
seri
you
must
admit
that
there
is
some
sort
of
way
to
measur
likelihood
howev
fuzzi
it
is
imposs
for
all
other
thing
to
be
equal
so
your
fantasi
is
total
meaningless
so
how
about
real
life
person
a
rob
a
servic
station
with
two
peopl
in
it
use
a
automat
pistol
get
and
is
convict
and
sentenc
for
three
year
person
b
with
a
similar
crimin
record
rob
a
servic
station
with
two
peopl
in
it
use
a
revolv
get
and
is
convict
sinc
they
use
two
differ
type
of
handgun
are
comparison
total
meaningless
say
you
drop
a
pencil
to
see
if
the
graviti
still
work
my
cat
are
alway
test
thi
they
dont
trust
me
to
pay
the
graviti
bill
on
time
you
have
never
drop
a
pencil
at
that
exact
time
of
the
centuri
befor
so
all
previou
evid
is
meaningless
or
would
you
be
surpris
if
it
flew
out
the
window
instead
of
hit
the
desk
