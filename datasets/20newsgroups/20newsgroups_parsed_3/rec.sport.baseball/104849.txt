rbi
question
is
there
ani
judgement
call
on
the
part
of
the
scorer
for
sac
fli
rbi
thi
is
the
situat
that
brought
the
question
up
the
red
sox
were
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
th
by
a
score
of
the
marin
had
the
base
load
with
out
the
batter
hit
a
fli
to
center
which
the
fielder
catch
the
runner
at
third
tag
and
score
without
a
throw
now
without
a
judgement
call
and
i
dont
think
there
is
one
thi
is
an
rbi
for
the
batter
it
seem
to
me
that
a
better
name
for
thi
would
be
defens
indiffer
sinc
it
doesnt
realli
matter
whether
the
guy
at
third
score
at
that
point
i
know
i
can
think
of
sever
if
the
marin
stole
third
and
second
which
open
the
base
would
allow
and
then
the
batter
hit
a
grounder
which
the
third
baseman
get
deep
in
the
hole
between
himself
and
third
he
wouldnt
have
a
play
at
home
third
or
second
for
the
out
and
mayb
he
therefor
cant
make
the
throw
to
first
to
get
the
last
out
etc
scenario
too
but
doe
it
realli
matter
if
thi
guy
score
thi
way
when
your
down
by
if
the
tie
run
is
go
to
score
so
is
the
guy
on
third
the
point
is
that
the
batter
imo
shouldnt
get
credit
an
rbi
for
utterli
fail
to
do
hi
job
which
at
thi
point
is
to
get
a
hit
or
a
walk
not
trade
an
out
for
one
run
what
do
you
guy
think
regard
burk
charl
s
homan
go
red
sox
go
