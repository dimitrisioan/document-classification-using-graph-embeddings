write
we
can
not
isol
the
total
contribut
that
ani
player
at
ani
posit
make
to
hi
team
victori
and
sinc
we
can
not
make
that
measur
with
complet
confid
of
object
and
sinc
there
is
no
absolut
necessari
reason
to
make
that
kind
of
subject
measur
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
pointless
if
a
gm
is
tri
to
put
togeth
a
win
team
he
might
consid
era
he
might
consid
attitud
he
might
consid
past
perform
in
key
situat
but
what
he
is
look
for
is
not
the
player
that
he
consid
the
best
the
gm
is
look
for
the
player
he
think
can
help
hi
team
win
we
can
not
isol
complet
roger
but
we
can
make
a
pretti
good
estim
i
wont
claim
to
split
hair
and
say
that
we
can
realli
measur
who
wa
better
robbi
alomar
or
carlo
baerga
last
year
the
differ
is
too
close
to
call
but
larkin
and
lee
clemen
and
morri
the
differ
are
too
great
there
in
your
measur
of
the
game
whi
should
a
team
that
ha
just
won
it
all
ever
replac
a
singl
player
sinc
they
are
now
clearli
best
how
can
they
do
better
yet
everi
team
can
alway
find
someplac
where
they
beleiv
they
can
improv
the
team
they
can
alway
find
a
player
a
littl
better
than
one
they
alreadi
have
btw
by
my
definit
the
best
player
is
the
one
who
doe
the
most
thing
to
help
hi
team
win
i
will
allow
that
thi
could
vari
depend
on
who
els
is
on
the
team
by
have
aptitud
one
team
need
more
than
other
basebal
is
a
team
game
but
it
is
made
of
individu
talent
it
is
absurd
to
judg
the
success
or
failur
of
an
individu
by
the
success
or
failur
of
hi
teammat
whom
he
did
not
choos
at
least
in
most
case
morri
won
last
year
becaus
he
play
on
a
team
with
joe
carter
robbi
alomar
tom
henk
juan
guzman
john
olerud
et
al
clemen
lost
becaus
he
wa
surround
by
such
lesser
perform
a
herm

jeff
reardon
to
defin
the
qualiti
of
the
team
a
a
sum
of
it
compon
a

albeit
imperfectli
is
a
lesser
error
than
defin
the
