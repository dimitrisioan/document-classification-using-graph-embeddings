no
clutch
hitter
mayb
no

me
either
but
some
peopl
are
i
just
know
it
but
whi
would
you
want
to
use
rbi
rbi
is
an
attempt
to
measur
is
some
combin
of
clutch
hit
and
power
hit
if
you
believ
in
clutch
hit
then
look
at
how
the
guy
hit
with
risp
if
you
want
to
see
how
good
of
a
slugger
he
is
then
look
at
hi
slug
averag
