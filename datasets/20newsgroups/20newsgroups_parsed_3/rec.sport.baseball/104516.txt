but
orosco
austin
manzanillo
and
lloyd
all
took
part
in
the
mockeri
of
a
bullpen
yesterday
how
thi
for
number
maldanado

pitch
three
scoreless
inning
and
navarro

is
the
next
lowest

at
anoth
ouch
look
at
the
stat
it
not
hard
to
see
whi
the

in
fact
doesnt
sound
bad
when
your
averag
three
runsgam
and
give
up
game
still
it
earli
and
thing
will
undoubtedli
get
better
the
offens
should
come
around
but
the
bullpen
is
a
major
worri
fetter
plesac
and
austin
gave
the
brewer
great
middl
relief
last
year
lloyd
maldanado
manzanillo
fetter
austin
and
orosco
will
have
to
pick
up
the
pace
for
the
team
to
be
success
milwauke
won
a
number
of
game
last
year
when
middl
relief
either
held
small
lead
or
kept
small
deficit
in
place
the
starter
will
be
okay
the
defens
will
be
alright
and
the
hit
will
come
around
but
the
bullpen
is
a
big
question
mark
