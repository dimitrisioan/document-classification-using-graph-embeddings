thi
is
not
the
same
a
claim
a
some
do
that
galarraga
inabl
to
defer
gratif
isnt
hurt
hi
team
becaus
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
or
is
an
rbi
guy
or
whatev
alright
that
enough
ive
suffer
with
all
kind
of
insult
a
typic
for
the
net
but
give
me
a
break
galarraga
is
current
bat
over
and
you
guy
are
complain
that
he
isnt
draw
enough
walk
what
would
he
have
to
do
to
plea
you
guy
bat
you
can
hardli
claim
that
he
is
hurt
hi
team
it
would
help
if
hi
obp
were
higher
than
hi
bat
averag
ye
the
april
usa
today
list
le
grand
chapeau
a
have
a
bat
averag
and
a
obp
that
on
for
hit
with
zip
nil
nada
walk
the
reason
a
lot
of
u
are
down
on
galarraga
is
that
he
ha
a
long
histori
of
show
that
thi
is
nowher
near
hi
real
level
of
abil
except
for
draw
walk
if
he
hit
for
say
even
ab
id
be
convinc
that
there
wa
a
real
chang
in
hi
abil
if
he
did
it
with
an
obpavg
id
not
onli
be
amaz
but
id
make
a
bet
that
that
would
be
a
uniqu
feat
in
the
histori
of
the
game
but
what
do
ab
prove
look
at
some
of
the
other
fluke
player
at
thi
point
in
the
season
player
avg
ab
blauser
grace
milligan
conin
lan
slaught
are
ani
of
these
guy
realli
that
good
well
in
a
word
no
how
signific
is
galarraga
averag
at
the
ab
level
a
hit
is
worth
about
if
hed
had
one
of
those
hit
call
an
error
and
one
taken
away
by
a
good
defens
play
hed
be
in
the
rang
if
he
goe
for
in
hi
next
game
he
all
the
way
down
to
in
one
game
come
back
in
june
let
talk
then
if
it
happen
that
the
pitcher
start
throw
him
fewer
good
pitch
and
he
start
make
lot
of
out
a
someon
specul
might
happen
then
i
would
agre
with
you
that
he
isnt
take
enough
pitch
my
comment
that
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
doesnt
mean
that
he
should
have
a
licens
to
swing
at
bad
pitch
and
make
out
it
more
along
the
line
of
he
bat
and
lead
the
leagu
in
rbi
so
what
bloodi
differ
doe
it
make
if
he
isnt
draw
a
lot
of
walk
sheesh
it
histori
greg
andr
histori
is
that
he
doesnt
walk
much
becaus
he
swing
at
bad
pitch
so
hi
averag
isnt
veri
good
ab
doesnt
mean
an
aw
lot
compar
to
a
histori
of
a
coupl
of
thousand
especi
when
there
ampl
evid
bb
in
that
hi
basic
hit
approach
hasnt
chang
yeah
he
might
suddenli
have
turn
into
a
hitter
who
never
walk
but
dont
bet
the
rent
money
