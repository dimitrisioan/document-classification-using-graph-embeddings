the
hall
of
fame
steve
tomassi
write
hi
basebal
fan
so

it
i
mean
heck
if
dave
winfield
hohum
is
serious
be
consid
for
it
a
is
lee
smith
ha
then
whi
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chanc
or
darrel
evan
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of
fame
take
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddi
murray
and
jeff
reardon
unfortun
you
seem
to
lack
the
abil
to
rate
player
dave
winfield
ha
had
a
better
career
than
half
the
peopl
in
the
hall
of
fame
eddi
murray
and
darrel
evan
are
both
one
of
the
top
player
of
all
time
lee
smith
ha
had
probabl
the
greatest
long
career
of
ani
relief
pitcher
sinc
with
the
possibl
except
of
gossag
on
the
other
hand
kingman
probabl
isnt
one
of
the
best
player
of
all
time
and
reardon
though
a
good
pitcher
isnt
in
smith
class
career
wise
well
in
ani
case
i
am
sick
and
tire
mostli
sick
of
everybodi
give
hall
of
fame
consider
to
player
that
are
by
today
standard
margin
honestli
ozzi
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyr
both
shortstop
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
were
talk
of
the
top
player
of
all
time
here
there
probabl
arent
shortstop
in
histori
who
were
better
than
these
two
let
be
a
littl
more
select
huh
stop
hand
out
these
honor
so
liber
save
them
for
the
guy
who
realli
deserv
it
face
it
if
someth
isnt
done
there
will
be
littl
prestig
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymor
when
certain
individu
believ
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morri
are
potenti
candid
the
absurd
is
appar
garvey
suck
morri
while
a
veri
good
pitcher
simpli
doesnt
belong
near
cooperstown
gee
can
these
guy
even
compar
to
the
more
like
futur
hall
of
famer
like
kirbi
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
if
puckett
and
ryan
okay
no
if
there
get
into
to
the
hall
they
will
be
margin
hall
of
famer
unless
puckett
keep
hit
like

last
year
for
a
while
longer

put
thi
in
perspect

list
of

linear
weight
valu
of

in
parenthesi
is
how
high
they
are
up
on
the
greatest
ever
list
if
they
make
it
while
no
one
would
claim
these
are
perfect
rank
they

a
good
valu
of
