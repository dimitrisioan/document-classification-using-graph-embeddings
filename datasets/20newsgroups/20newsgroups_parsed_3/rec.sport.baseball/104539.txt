re
dave
kingman
for
the
hall
of
fame
in
articl
steve
tomassi
write
hi
basebal
fan
so
what
do
you
say
dont
you
think
he
deserv
it
i
mean
heck
if
dave
winfield
hohum
is
serious
be
consid
for
it
a
is
lee
smith
ha
then
whi
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chanc
or
darrel
evan
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of
fame
take
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddi
murray
and
jeff
reardon
i
am
tri
to
think
how
to
respond
to
thi
without
involv
person
feel
or
percept
and
i
can
not
without
have
stat
to
back
up
my
point
howev
i
think
you
approach
thi
the
wrong
way
i
believ
all
of
the
peopl
mention
here
deserv
the
hall
of
fame
more
than
dave
kingman
doe
i
feel
they
were
all
much
better
player
i
am
not
say
i
fell
they
deserv
to
go
but
that
they
would
deserv
it
more
imho
dave
kingman
defin
not
they
guy
onli
had
a
coupl
of
year
were
he
could
hit
with
atleast
a
respect
averag
the
rest
of
hi
career
i
do
not
think
he
wa
veri
fear
by
pitcher
i
also
do
not
think
he
did
a
lot
for
the
game
i
mean
realli
i
am
a
met
fan
he
wa
a
met
for
part
of
hi
career
and
i
still
would
not
back
him
for
the
hall
of
fame
dave
winfield
i
think
so
he
is
fear
by
pitcher
he
ha
had
sever
season
where
he
hit
for
a
respect
averag
and
hi
product
number
are
in
my
opinion
without
stat
better
than
kingman
probabl
by
quit
a
bit
i
also
perceiv
him
to
be
a
leader
mayb
not
a
much
a
some
other
peopl
but
none
the
le
a
leader
i
think
he
ha
made
substanti
contribut
to
the
game
of
basebal
and
to
societi
exampl
of
thi
are
some
of
the
charit
thing
he
ha
done
i
know
some
of
thi
from
when
he
wa
with
the
yanke
i
think
he
the
type
of
player
that
kid
can
look
up
to
and
while
thi
is
defin
not
the
onli
criterion
for
the
hall
of
fame
i
think
it
deserv
some
consider
lee
smith
mayb
i
would
have
to
see
hi
stat
again
but
he
defin
would
deserv
to
go
befor
the
like
of
kingman
darrel
evan
no
eddi
murray
mayb
he
ha
had
a
veri
good
career
he
is
a
leader
although
a
silent
one
he
is
a
good
role
model
are
the
stat
good
enough
i
am
not
sure
but
i
would
onc
again
believ
they
are
much
better
than
kingman
both
the
averag
a
well
a
the
power
number
but
not
a
good
a
winfield
just
think
eddi
did
not
have
a
much
public
for
most
of
hi
great
year
jeff
reardon
my
guess
is
no
but
it
kind
of
depend
on
hi
number
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
would
take
lee
smith
first
well
in
ani
case
i
am
sick
and
tire
mostli
sick
of
everybodi
give
hall
of
fame
consider
to
player
that
are
by
today
standard
margin
honestli
ozzi
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyr
both
shortstop
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
well
i
strongli
disagre
here
both
of
these
guy
deserv
it
for
sure
i
talk
about
leadership
abov
both
of
these
guy
are
leader
and
have
been
instument
in
lead
their
team
to
the
post
season
robin
doe
have
veri
good
offens
number
both
averag
and
power
and
ozzi
ha
okay
number
offens
the
differ
with
ozzi
is
that
if
you
gave
him
a
home
run
for
everi
run
he
save
by
make
an
incred
play
at
shortstop
he
would
have
shatter
aaron
home
run
mark
by
now
how
mani
of
those
great
play
save
game
how
mani
of
those
great
play
motiv
hi
team
to
ralli
and
win
a
game
while
i
believ
both
of
these
guy
have
number
basebal
is
about
more
than
number
or
at
least
win
at
basebal
is
about
more
than
number
both
of
these
guy
are
proven
star
and
belong
in
the
hall
of
fame
a
doe
georg
brett
who
also
belong
in
thi
class
of
player
let
be
a
littl
more
select
huh
stop
hand
out
these
honor
so
liber
save
them
for
the
guy
who
realli
deserv
it
face
it
if
someth
isnt
done
there
will
be
littl
prestig
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymor
when
certain
individu
believ
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morri
are
potenti
candid
the
absurd
is
appar
gee
can
these
guy
even
compar
to
the
more
like
futur
hall
of
famer
like
kirbi
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
steve
garvey
i
am
not
sure
probabl
not
but
i
guess
i
could
see
someon
make
a
case
for
him
jack
morri
onc
again
not
my
first
choic
but
i
can
see
whi
someon
might
bring
up
hi
name
kirbi
puckett
probabl
the
onli
reason
i
do
not
say
defin
is
he
still
ha
time
left
in
hi
career
if
he
continu
do
what
he
ha
been
then
my
probabl
will
turn
into
a
defin
nolan
ryan
is
there
realli
ani
doubt
i
think
i
heard
someth
about
him
have
some
record
mayb
they
were
not
all
good
i
dont
know
i
did
not
hear
ani
of
them
just
the
number
he
ha
the
number
he
ha
the
contribut
to
the
game
and
commun
and
he
is
a
great
role
model
i
would
not
say
that
he
is
the
best
pitcher
to
ever
pitch
the
game
probabl
not
even
top
but
he
would
be
the
first
pitcher
i
would
put
in
the
hall
of
fame
becaus
of
hi
accomplish
nohitt
strikeout
respect
number
even
with
some
weaker
team
you
can
go
on
and
on
i
realli
hope
he
get
all
the
possibl
vote
so
in
sum
up
i
have
group
those
that
belong
those
that
probabl
do
but
i
am
not
sure
and
those
that
i
lean
toward
say
dont
belong
at
least
not
without
my
see
stat
and
possibl
hear
reason
whi
they
should
go
ye
winfield
yount
brettnot
in
your
mail
o
smith
puckett
and
ryan
mayb
murray
and
l
smith
no
reardon
garvey
morri
evan
and
defin
kingman
a
i
said
i
do
not
have
the
stat
around
so
i
do
not
have
number
to
back
thi
up
these
are
entir
my
opinion
base
on
my
percept
