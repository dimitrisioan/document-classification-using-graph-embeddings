are
mani
problem
occur
for
me
one
of
them
is
the

statist
for

what
doe
it
say
era
indic
the
averag
number
of
earn
run

per
nine

game
thu
if
a
pitcher
pitch
inning
and
gave
up
earn
run
hi
inning
equivel
perfom
would
be
earn
run
thu
hi
era
is
to
comput
the
era

simpli
take
the
number
of
earn
run
divid
by
the
inning
pitch
and
then
multipl
the
result
by

erip
i
think
there
is
anoth
formula
for
era
i
heard
someth
about
it
last
year
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
im
gon
na
give
it
a
stab
it
allow
for
a
pitcher
to
pitch
more
than
inning
at
a
time
and
not
benefit
cuz
it
use
out
record
instead
of
inning
pitch
era
erout
record
like
i
said
im
not
sure
thi
is
exactli
it
but
im
pretti
sure
they
chang
it
to
someth
of
the
sort
an
earn
run
is
run
that
is
given
up
by
the
pitcher
that
is
not
attribut
to
a
field
error
more
specif
if
an
error
occur
that
repres
the
third
out
all
run
score
after
the
error
are
consid
unearn
run
earn
run
are
also
run
score
a
a
result
of
player
who
were
left
on
base
when
the
pitcher
exit
the
game
here
are
some
exampl
if
there
are
two
out
in
an
inning
and
there
are
men
on
base
if
an
error
occur
that
repres
the
third
out
all
of
the
run
after
thi
error
and
not
count
a
earn
run
if
a
pitcher
issu
some
base
on
ball
walk
and
leav
the
game
befor
the
inning
is
complet
he
is
respons
for
the
peopl
who
were
left
on
base
if
the
those
runner
who
were
left
on
base
score
and
the
score
wa
not
a
result
of
an
error
those
eran
run
are
attribut
to
the
pitcher
who
left
the
game
