m
tate
write
a
for
rush
if
there
realli
is
a
qualit
differ
between
the
minor
and
the
major
that
requir
a
period
of
adjust
and
i
dont
believ
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
wast
lopez
year
old
good
season
than
hi
year
old
veri
good
season
or
hi
yearold
excel
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclim
the
more
of
hi
prime
you
get
to
use
can
anybodi
name
a
player
who
wa
rush
to
the
major
let
for
argument
sake
defin
rush
a
brought
up
to
the
major
for
more
than
a
cup
of
coffe
prior
at
age
or
younger
and
perform
below
expect
whose
career
wa
damag
by
thi
rush
im
seriou
i
tend
to
agre
with
david
that
bring
the
player
up
sooner
is
better
but
id
like
to
look
at
player
for
whom
thi
theori
didnt
work
if
there
are
ani
id
prefer
player
within
the
last
year
or
so
becaus
then
i
can
look
up
their
minor
leagu
stat
it
import
to
distinguish
between
player
who
legitim
had
career
below
what
their
minor
leagu
number
would
have
project
a
oppos
to
player
who
were
hype
and
fail
but
actual
had
career
not
out
of
line
with
their
minor
leagu
number
let
kick
it
off
with
an
exampl
of
a
player
who
wa
rush
although
there
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
ani
damag
to
hi
career
jay
bell
wa
given
pa
in
the
major
leagu
at
age
and
perform
well
below
what
you
would
expect
from
hi
aaa
number
the
same
season
he
got
pa
the
next
year
at
age
and
still
underperform
howev
the
next
year
at
age
hi
perform
improv
and
he
won
the
everyday
shortstop
job
and
ha
been
there
ever
sinc
it
realli
hard
for
me
to
see
where
he
would
have
been
better
off
stay
in
the
minor
leagu
where
he
wa
perform
quit
well
in
aaa
dure
thi
time
rather
than
be
rush
cleveland
might
have
been
better
off
i
suppos
becaus
they
might
have
been
le
like
to
give
up
on
him
ye
if
you
bring
a
player
up
earli
he
like
go
to
struggl
but
doe
that
delay
the
time
at
which
he
stop
struggl
and
start
perform
up
to
expect
