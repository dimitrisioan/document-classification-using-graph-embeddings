tim

write
ideal
dh
should
be
the
strongest
offens
player
becaus
ani
schmoe
can
play
dh
if
he
can
hit
that
would
take
care
of
posit
correct
anomoli
such
a
frank
sinc
that
is
not
the
case
and
whi
not
is
it
alway
thi
way
then
we
are
go
to
have
troubl
find
the
true
valu
of
dh
use
the
same
model
a
that
for
posit
player
there
are
sever
reason
for
thi
differ
the
main
reason
is
that
good
hitter
in
their
prime
such
a
frank
thoma
and
danni
tartabul
are
rare
regular
dh
even
if
they
cant
field
it
more
commonli
a
place
to
put
age
veteran
anoth
use
of
the
dh
slot
is
to
help
a
player
come
back
from
injuri
slowli
get
hi
bat
in
the
lineup
without
forc
him
to
play
in
the
field
i
would
expect
such
player
to
hit
wors
a
dh
than
they
did
dure
the
rest
of
the
season
a
third
factor
is
that
most
player
who
split
time
between
dh
and
first
or
the
outfield
dont
hit
a
well
a
dh
for
some
reason
reggi
jackson
wa
a
good
exampl
in
five
year
a
a
rfdh
for
the
angel
he
hit
like
the
old
reggi
when
he
wa
in
right
the
second
and
third
factor
will
be
lost
if
player
are
consid
by
their
primari
posit
onli
a
player
who
play
game
in
right
and
at
dh
will
count
onli
in
the
right
fielder
averag
a
logic
start
place
would
be
to
look
at
defens
replac
valu
if
you
can
find
it
for
b
or
lf
or
someth
we
can
assum
that
if
forc
to
play
defens
they
would
play
at
true
zero
valu
even
though
i
doubt
thi
is
actual
true
for
player
like
winfield
and
molitor
thi
would
let
u
discount
the
time
they
spend
play
dh
becaus
that
forc
the
team
to
find
anoth
real
fielder
to
play
thi
make
sens
you
might
also
look
at
it
anoth
way
although
the
averag
offens
perform
of
a
dh
may
be
lower
than
for
a
left
fielder
the
replacementlevel
offens
perform
is
certainli
lower
if
you
are
a
left
fielder
but
cant
hit
well
enough
to
keep
a
job
anywher
then
you
certainli
cant
hit
well
enough
to
keep
a
job
at
dh
david
grabin
we
are
sorri
but
the
number
you
have
dial
is
imaginari

rotat
