re
young
catcher
mark
singer
said
most
catcher
need
to
be
solid
defens
player
to
help
their
club
in
the
big
those
are
the
argument
against
lopez
for
the
brave
for
thi
year
now
the
brave
have
two
catcher
who
have
demonstr
solid
abil
to
call
game
to
work
with
the
pitcher
to
throw
out
runner
thi
is
the
crux
of
the
argument
to
me
at
least
both
the
sdcn
and
the
nonsdcn
camp
seem
to
agre
on
the
fact
that
a
catcher
defens
is
basic
nonmeasur
at
present
you
can
talk
about
how
import
call
a
game
is
or
frame
the
pitch
or
block
ball
in
the
dirt
but
there
is
littl
or
no
way
to
tell
exactli
how
variou
catcher
rank
in
defens
look
at
lopez
specif
is
there
ani
reason
to
suspect
that
he
is
a
bad
defens
catcher
other
then
the
fact
that
the
brave
or
the
medium
ha
label
him
a
bad
defens
catcher
a
far
a
i
can
tell
he
doesnt
have
ani
particular
problem
in
hi
mechan
such
a
sasser
he
might
be
a
littl
rough
around
the
edg
in
block
the
ball
or
frame
the
pitch
to
get
a
good
call
but
all
he
need
to
clear
that
up
is
play
and
practic
time
i
cant
see
how
repetit
at
aaa
are
ani
better
then
rep
in
the
major
all
were
left
with
is
the
call
the
game
aspect
olsen
and
berryhil
at
alway
given
credit
for
call
good
game
and
help
the
pitcher
staff
but
thi
is
a
reput
that
is
given
to
almost
all
veteran
catcher
how
is
catch
at
aaa
go
to
help
lopez
learn
the
major
leagu
pitch
staff
the
onli
way
ani
catcher
is
go
to
learn
tom
glavin
pitch
is
to
catch
tom
glavin
similarli
i
wouldnt
be
suppris
if
the
pitcher
claim
to
prefer
pitch
to
olsen
over
pitch
to
lopez
becaus
they
are
use
to
pitch
to
olsen
but
given
time
they
will
say
they
are
comfort
with
lopez
now
sinc
lopez
cant
learn
how
to
handl
the
major
leagu
pitcher
while
he
in
aaa
and
sinc
he
doesnt
have
ani
glare
problem
in
hi
mechan
what
is
he
go
to
learn
in
aaa
that
he
cant
learn
just
a
well
while
in
the
