up
ye
i
have
proof
there
are
realli
onli
two
adequ
way
to
measur
field
prowess
the
first
which
ha
the
advantag
of
be
applic
to
older

sinc
it
us
raw

avail
for
almost
all
of
mlb
histori
is
the
total
chanc
per
game
method
favor
by
the
total
basebal
peopl
among
other
it
basic
say
that
you
measur
a
fielder
by
how
mani
ball
he
get
to
but
it
is
subject
to
all
kind
of
bia
and
is
almost
complet
useless
for
first
basemen
from
the
raw
stat
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
of
a
first
baseman
putout
were
made
on
throw
from
other
fielder
and
which
were
made
on
hi
own
play
likewis
you
cant
tell
whether
a
doubl
play
wa
or
field
run
thu
give
a
first
baseman
no
credit
for
putout
or
doubl
play
onli
for
assist
and
error
it
thu
favor
first
basemen
who
play
deep
reach
a
lot
of
ball
but
forc
the
pitcher
to
cover
first
more
frequent
it
also
hurt
first
baseman
who
play
behind
lefthand
pitch
staff
and
thu
face
few
lefthand
batter
a
better
method
but
newer
and
base
ondata
that
ha
onli
been
collect
over
the
last
few
year
measur
the
percentag
of
ball
hit
into
the

of
the
