alan
sepinwal
write
some
pleasant
and
then
some
not
so
pleasant
surpris
about
the
edit
of
the
bronx
bomber
so
far
first
the
pleasant
spike
owen
all
through
spring
train
thi
guy
wa
look
like
the
second
come
of
mike
gallego
but
with
even
wors
hit
now
the
guy
is
third
in
the
major
leagu
in
ba
and
he
rank
pretti
high
in
total
hit
and
run
score
i
know
it
still
earli
in
the
season
but
he
and
pat
kelli
more
on
him
in
a
minut
have
provid
a
lot
of
spark
at
the
bottom
of
the
order
that
given
the
big
guy
mattingli
tartabul
oneil
plenti
of
rbi
opportun
let
hope
he
keep
thi
up
pat
kelli
the
guy
is
final
show
some
of
the
abil
that
led
stick
michael
to
label
him
a
star
for
the
s
i
wouldnt
go
that
far
but
kelli
look
infinit
improv
at
bat
i
guess
the
tip
he
took
from
bogg
in
spring
train
realli
paid
off
huh
and
here
i
thought
bogg
would
never
do
anyth
to
help
anybodi
besid
himself
and
hi
glove
like
alway
ha
been
terrif
he
and
mattingli
compris
the
best
defens
right
side
of
the
infield
in
all
of
basebal
imho
paul
oneil
we
had
to
get
rid
of
roberto
kelli
partli
becaus
he
wa
under
too
much
pressur
in
ny
to
be
the
next
barri
bond
he
wont
do
that
in
cinci
either
and
partli
becaus
he
had
thi
real
unprofession
tendenc
to
give
up
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
i
just
felt
that
we
couldv
gotten
more
for
him
than
oneil
well
so
far
oneil
is
turn
out
just
fine
he
look
like
he
should
be
abl
to
duplic
if
not
surpass
mel
hall
number
from
last
year
and
he
keep
oppos
pitcher
from
pitch
around
tartabul
now
if
onli
buck
would
play
him
against
lefti
some
more
to
see
what
he
can
do
wickman
a
friend
made
a
comparison
between
wickman
and
jack
morri
they
never
have
impress
stat
but
they
alway
find
some
way
to
win
although
morri
seem
to
be
lose
that
abil
i
figur
that
wickman
would
be
the
least
import
part
of
the
steve
sax
trade
best
trade
sinc
we
got
that
ruth
guy
mayb
wind
up
a
a
good
middl
reliev
but
i
like
what
ive
seen
so
far
he
doesnt
pitch
pretti
but
he
get
the
job
done
key
what
go
on
here
key
wa
just
suppos
to
provid
the
rotat
with
some
stabil
you
know
shore
up
the
left
side
provid
experi
get
mayb
win
and
here
thi
guy
is
domin
everybodi
he
face
who
need
maddux
or
cone
ill
take
key
ani
day
and
now
the
not
so
pleasant
surpris
spike
owen
sure
he
hit
like
crazi
but
the
guy
can
not
field
to
save
hi
life
and
they
said
he
wa
brought
in
to
provid
defens
velard
stankiewicz
and
even
silvestri
are
better
defens
than
owen
rememb
it
still
earli
look
for
hi
offens
to
tail
off
and
hi
defens
to
improv
hope
he
ha
that
rep
becaus
i
heard
that
either
last
year
or
over
the
last
year
or
someth
like
that
he

the
third
highest
field
percentag
among

healthi
and
hell
produc
well
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
sure
he

all
solo
shot
and
he
hasnt
gotten
ani
of
the
big
rbi
that
your
cleanup

you
then
again
he

a
slow
start
last
year
onc

is
and
turn
into
a
oneman
wreck
