befor
the

safe
the
correct
call
is

if
fair
runner
may
advanc
at
own
risk
got
ta
tag
up
if
caught
etc
it
is
not
a
forc
and
the
pop
wa
not
caught
so
regardless
of
whether
the
s
tag
b
or
b
it
wasnt
clear
abov
he
hasnt
got
the
runner
out
b
the
umpir
dont
declar
the

decid
for
whatev
reason
that
the

fli
rule
doesnt
appli
sound
like
a
bad
call
here
but
that
not
the
point
the
batter
is
not
out
so
a
forc
situat
is
creat
therefor
the
runner
is
out
unless
by

l
the
ball
is
dead
and
the
