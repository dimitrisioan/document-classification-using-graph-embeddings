a
far
a
i
can
tell
youd
also
have
a
hard
time
convinc
me
to
rate
him
better
than
or
equal
to
clement
two
set
of
number
career
equival
averag
and
equival
run
ruth
aaron
ott
robinson
clement
winfield
ruth
is
in
a
class
by
himself
for
both
rate
eqa
and
total
eqr
perform
aaron
run
over
everybodi
in
the
total
categori
ott
and
robinson
who
lead
winfield
in
both
categori
could
be
safe
put
ahead
of
ahead
of
him
reggi
too
although
he
is
bare
ahead
these
number
are
normal
for
leagu
and
park
clement
is
held
down
by
some
realli
anem
offens
product
in
hi
earliest
year
and
wa
still
product
when
he
die
it
is
reason
safe
to
assum
he
had
run
more
he
could
have
gotten
still
jackson
waner
clement
and
winfield
form
a
pretti
tight

a
we
were
talk
about
peak

averag
and
b
clement
wa
the
best
field
rf
of
all
time
a
far
a
anyon
can
tell
i
did
a
quick
scan
last
night
look
for
player
with
a
peak
compar
to

better
than

judgement
you
could
make
good
case
for
ruth
aaron
ott
robinson
clement
kalin
mari
klein
jackson
waner
and
probabl
a
few
other
thi
is
not
a
knock
on
winfield
but
a
comment
on
hi
consist
all
of
those
other
player
had
awesom
stretch
and
veri
good
stretch
while
winfield
ha
been
more
uniformli
