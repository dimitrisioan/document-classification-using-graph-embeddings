a
long
a
they
do
not

ani
that
are
in

wa
the

wrong
should
he
have
been
more
awar
of
the
situat
and
act
to
avoid
ani
possibl
of
interfer
or
wa
he
human
and
just
react
by
the
way
he
is
a
season
ticket
holder
and
on
hi
request
the
dodger
have
reloc
hi
seat
to
anoth
area
of
the
stadium
where
futur
interfer
is
imposs
other
have
question
whi
darryl
should
be
so
concern
with
what
the
fan
did
when
he
ha
a
grand
total
of
rbi
through
the
first
nine
game
i
question
what
he
wa
do
in
right
center
with
a
lefthand
pull
hitter
up
and
the
game
on
the
line
had
he
been
closer
to
the
play
he
certainli
would
have
had
a
much
better
chanc
of
catch
the
ball
but
i
guess
the
big
debat
continu
a
to
what
are
the
respons
of
the
fan
