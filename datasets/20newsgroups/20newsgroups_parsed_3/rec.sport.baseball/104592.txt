i
dont
have
a
histori
handi
but
i
dont
recal
that
the
preponder
of
roy
come
from
win
team
in
fact
i
think
team
perform
is
gener
irrelev
a
almost
alway
the
most
deserv
candid
win
am
i
wrong
not
realli
though
i
wouldnt
person
say
the
most
deserv
candid
win
rare
doe
a
player
win
roy
when
call
up
in
mid
season
and
there
have
been
sever
dud
in
recent
year
but
thi
is
more
a
factor
of
mediot
bia
than
anyth
els
i
wonder
if
amar
hit
like
he
is
capabl
of
will
he
receiv
roti
vote
he
onli
he
could
have
a
long
career
ahead
of
him
and
he
is
not
necessarili
on
a
lose
team
while
the
angel
staff
is
still
veri
weak
their
everyday
lineup
is
do
quit
well
thank
you
snow
is
play
great
salmon
is
learn
to
make
the
adjust
easley
appear
fine
but
even
if
he
not
flora
is
readi
to
come
up
between
gonzal
and
gruber
theyll
manag
the
hot
corner
polonia
and
curti
are
steadi
and
headi
even
myer
and
orton
are
contribut
person
i
think
they
can
finish
over
which
make
them
a
win
team
i
think
they
are
a
seconddivis
team
they
should
finish
ahead
of
the
royal
marin
and
possibl
athlet
but
i
dont
think
theyll
be
abov
i
think
the
east
is
stronger
thi
year
last
year
their
pitch
wa
bad
and
their
offens
wa
horribl
thi
year
their
offens
is
better
but
their
pitch
is
still
pretti
bad
even
if
finley
return
to
form
he
wont
replac
what
they
lost
in
abbott
sanderson
farrel
i
dont
believ
it
and
while
their
ba
may
be
good
and
they
have
decent
speed
their
offens
lack
punch
they
dont
have
ani
bona
fide
power
hitter
salmon
snow
davi
and
curti
none
with
more
than
hr
potenti

valentin
p
which
al
team
had
the
most
steal
last
week
those
gogo
tiger
the
mediot
final
manag
to
convinc
them
that
they
need
more
balanc
in
their
lineup
you
see
they
were
score
too
mani
run
too
consist
got
ta

more
to
break
