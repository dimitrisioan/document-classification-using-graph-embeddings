built
like

huckabay
write
wa
go
over
some
video
last
night
and
you
wrote
an
excel
report
about
it
he
bulk
up
too
much
period
he
need
to
lose
about
pound
not
gain
more
bulk
hi
bat
speed
ha
absolut
vanish
conserv
id
say
he
lost
of
hi
bat
speed
and
that
a
huge
amount
of
speed
that
open
stanc
is
kill
him
note
that
he
act
sort
of
like
brian
down
way
open
to
start
then
close
up
a
ball
is
releas
down
could
do
thi
without
signific
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
alway
close
hi
stanc
the
same
way
sometim
hi
hip
are
open
sometim
theyr
fulli
close
without
a
good
start
point
it
hard
to
make
adjust
in
your
swing
i
understand
from
an
unreli
sourc
that
canseco
wa
consid
expend
by
the
a
when
he
refus
to
accept
ani
coach
about
hi
bat
stanc
the
a
brain
trust
came
to
believ
that
hi
back
problem
were
exacerb
if
not
caus
by
have
a
wide
open
stanc
close
it
quickli
and
then
swing
with
a
lot
of
torqu
that
a
paraphras
of
what
i
rememb
in
ani
event
canseco
took
the
road
that
he
and
he
alon
would
decid
hi
stanc
and
the
a
began
to
believ
that
he
would
either
reinjur
himself
or
begin
to
lose
hi
abil
to
hit
for
both
averag
and
power
asid
from
salt
away
a
larg
sum
of
a
cash
that
i
could
never
touch
so
that
id
never
have
to
work
again
id
restructur
my
entir
swing
appar
you
sound
like
larussa
second
drop
pound
cut
out
the
weight
work
the
a
also
object
about
thi
if
canseco
open
stanc
and
result
bad
habit
are
a
result
of
hi
back
problem
hell
be
out
of
basebal
in
three
year
if
not
he
could
still
hit
hr
again
im
just
repeat
someth
i
heard
but
possibl
the
caus
and
effect
is
the
revers
of
that
