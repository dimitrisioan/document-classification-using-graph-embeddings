ken
kubey
said
i
suppos
a
foul
ball
machin
like
brett
butler
is
pretti
valuabl
but
id
rather
watch
and
root
for
the
lower
obp
guy
who
can
actual
hit
the
ball
now
thi
is
a
legitim
point
basebal
is
entertain
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
peopl
who
find
certain
style
of
play
more
entertain
than
other
regardless
of
their
winvalu
person
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
slugbunt
i
doubt
it
a
highpercentag
play
but
i
get
a
big
kick
out
of
it
i
am
will
to
live
with
the
bad
consequ
in
exchang
for
the
fun
of
cours
thi
is
not
the
same
a
claim
a
some
do
that
galarraga
inabl
to
defer
gratif
isnt
hurt
hi
team
becaus
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
or
is
an
rbi
guy
or
whatev
and
final
id
like
to
point
out
that
mani
high
obp
guy
draw
their
walk
more
becaus
pitcher
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
becaus
they
have
a
great
eye
im
not
sure
i
use
to
think
thi
wa
true
but
more
and
more
im
becom
convinc
that
it
the
other
way
around
among
player
with
the
physic
abil
to
hit
the
