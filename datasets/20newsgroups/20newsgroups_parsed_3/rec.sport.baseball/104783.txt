subject
re
wfan
i
hope
that
thi
come
off
a
a
somewhat
unbias
ass
of
wfan
and
wipi
go
to
school
in
philadelphia
and
i
listen
to
both
station
on
a
consist
basi
now
that
the
fan
ha
mike
lupica
on
from
to
noon
they
have
a
person
who
can
get
the
big
name
guest
for
interview
and
not
just
of
local
import
he
did
have
dave
chekett
and
fred
wilpon
on
hi
show
but
he
had
bob
costa
and
magic
johnson
on
too
now
here
are
my
opinion
of
the
two
station
compet
talent
morn
show
in
my
opinion
i
think
imu
is
much
better
than
bruno
cataldi
and
morganti
even
though
i
would
feel
differ
if
morganti
had
a
better
crew
of
peopl
to
work
with
to
me
wip
tri
to
copi
imu
but
make
it
all
sport
a
a
theme
in
term
of
sport
imu
lack
the
blanket
of
the
airwav
but
he
interject
humor
and
polit
into
hi
show
am
to
noon
i
think
chuck
cooperstein
and
lupica
are
equal
in
their
abil
to
host
a
radio
show
but
i
think
chuck
ha
the
advantag
over
lupica
in
term
of
deal
with
the
caller
who
is
ask
about
who
the
local
team
is
go
to
draft
in
the
sixth
round
lupica
and
the
other
host
on
fan
get
better
interview
guest
but
i
heard
the
pd
of
wip
say
that
they
were
not
interest
in
interview
with
celebr
unless
it
wa
a
major
stori
i
would
consid
thi
even
becaus
they
are
two
differ
style
of
host
noon
to
pm
at
thi
point
i
would
have
to
give
a
big
advantag
to
jodi
mcdonald
over
len
berman
becaus
lenni
ha
onli
been
on
for
a
coupl
of
week
i
just
think
jm
ha
the
abil
to
transcend
the
homer
mental
of
the
philadelphia
fan
base
thi
is
most
evid
when
the
igglesphiladelphia
spell
play
the
cowboy
becaus
jm
is
a
huge
dalla
fan
where
el
can
you
have
peopl
call
up
and
predict
a
score
without
the
eg
of
the
hostsrewip
morn
guy
i
do
agre
that
jm
wa
great
on
the
fan
weekend
overnight
and
i
miss
hear
him
over
the
current
crop
of
rotat
host
i
feel
that
jm
is
the
best
sportstalk
host
on
either
station
by
a
good
margin
if
you
are
in
ny
and
you
cant
get
wip
jm
doe
fill
in
on
the
weekend
sometim
pm
to
pm
thi
is
the
time
when
jm
goe
up
against
francesa
and
russofatso
and
froot
loop
and
i
becom
the
most
divid
in
my
loyalti
mike
and
the
dog
are
veri
entertain
but
they
often
go
an
hour
or
so
without
call
or
even
to
minut
without
talk
about
sport
matd
do
get
great
guest
and
that
is
the
basi
for
their
show
so
it
is
like
the
to
debat
anoth
plu
is
the
appear
by
mike
and
chri
on
imu
in
the
morn
which
are
often
hilari
pm
to
pm
matd
go
up
against
frederick
and
missanelli
i
like
mike
missanelli
but
i
just
cant
stomach
steve
frederick
i
know
that
sf
came
from
philli
origin
but
when
he
wa
at
the
fan
he
wa
a
ny
homer
a
much
a
he
is
a
philli
homer
now
i
dont
listen
to
wip
much
after
pm
unless
there
is
a
game
on
that
night
but
you
will
see
later
for
the
reason
that
is
whi
i
give
the
advantag
to
fan
pm
to
midnight
sm
are
on
wip
until
and
then
it
is
the
man
who
make
eli
that
call
matd
all
the
time
seem
like
a
novic
on
charg
of
racism
g
cobb
thi
man
is
so
grate
on
my
nerv
that
if
i
listen
to
him
for
a
few
minut
i
go
nutsi
know
that
is
bias
but
listen
to
hi
show
on
fan
there
is
usual
a
game
on
knick
ranger
met
jet
or
st
john
basketbal
if
the
game
is
on
the
west
coast
then
it
is
usual
howi
rose
of
cours
i
think
dead
air
would
be
better
than
g
cobb
on
wip
but
wip
doe
air
sixer
and
flyer
game
dure
the
season
if
thi
is
the
sport
station
whi
did
they
lose
the
iggl
to
wysphom
of
howard
stern
in
phil
dure
the
summer
it
is
all
talk
on
wip
overal
i
would
have
to
give
the
advantag
to
wfan
with
the
except
of
to
and
to
where
it
is
even
and
to
where
wip
