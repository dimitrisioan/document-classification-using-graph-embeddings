i
dont
pretend
to
understand
statist
analysi
well
we
agre
on
the
last
part
cool
and
thank
you
for
an
intellig
respons
devoid
of
the
silli
namecal
of
other
one
of
the
basic
thing
you
need
to
have
in
a
statist
to
be
abl
to
predict
a
player
perform
on
it
in
the
futur
is
for
there
to
be
a
correl
from
year
to
year
a
player
bat
averag
is
correl
fairli
well
from
year
to
year
ok
the
basic
problem
with
someth
like
clutch
bat
averag
overal
bat
averag
is
that
the
correl
from
year
to
year
is
almost
zero
ad
to
the
sampl
size
doesnt
seem
to
help
much
actual
i
think
the
largescal
sampl
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seem
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
player
in
basebal
in
regard
to
ba
v
clutch
ba
deviat
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curv
the
xaxi
be
the
deviat
in
clutch
hit
v
nonclutch
the
yaxi
be
the
number
of
player
certainli
there
would
be
some
player
on
the
extrem
end
of
the
bell
my
supposit
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
player
consist
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
abl
to
make
some
reason
conclus
about
those
player
a
oppos
to
all
basebal
player
a
a
counterexampl
to
what
you
show
consid
the
follow
two
player
from
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
maldonado
lemon
if
you
had
had
these
two
player
in
by
your
logic
in
those
clutch
situat
youd
bat
maldonado
for
lemon
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
well
in
maldonado
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
while
lemon
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
befor
you
accus
me
of
complet
cook
the
data
you
wont
hear
those
kind
of
accus
from
me
it
is
interest
that
you
select
maldonado
becaus
he
is
someon
whom
i
have
also
look
at
he
ha
been
a
veri
inconsist
hitter
in
term
of
ba
hit
in
admittedli
he
ha
been
trade
between
leagu
a
well
a
club
hi
clutch
hit
record
is
equal
inconsist
so
for
my
purpos
in
i
would
not
draw
ani
conclus
about
hi
abil
to
hit
in
the
clutch
base
on
hi
prior
perform
i
dont
know
how
i
would
have
felt
in
but
you
may
inde
be
right
when
i
look
at
sabo
i
found
a
more
consist
record
of
hit
and
a
more
consist
pattern
of
hi
clutch
hit
be

below
hi
