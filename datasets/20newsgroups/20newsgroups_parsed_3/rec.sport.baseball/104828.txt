made

call

like
although
i
suspect
an
argument
might
have
gotten
gant

altogeth
but
if
hirschbeck
had
let
gant
step
out
the
whole
incid
probabl
would
have
been
avoid
my
impress
wa
that
gant
wa
not
step
out
he
wa
make
a
protest
about
the
lack
of
an
appeal
to
first
a
ha
been
point
out
earlier
there
is
no
appeal
to
first
on
a
strike
i
can
understand
gant
feel
a
littl
pressur
in
a
twoout
risp
game
ninth
inning
he
let
it
get
to
him
the
ump
also
overreact
gant
wa
stalk
off
but
i
doubt
he
would
have
been
gone
long
hirschbeck
should
have
let
him
have
a
moment
to
compos
himself
befor
tell
him
to
come
bat
imho
umpir
should
be
more
flexibl
than
what
hirschbeck
show
gant
wa
disturb
to
the
point
it
wa
pretti
like
he
would
not
get
a
hit
a
