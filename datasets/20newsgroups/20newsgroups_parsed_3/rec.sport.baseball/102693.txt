subject
re
young
catcher
sinc
i
wa
the
one
respons
for
these
diverg
thread
of
approx
post
go
back
to
the
brave
could
be
better
off
if
an
injuri
happen
i
may
a
well
inject
a
littl
more
fuel
to
the
flame
back
at
the
begin
of
spring
train
i
though
lopez
would
make
the
squad
easili
olson
wa
still
recov
from
hi
lateseason
injuri
knee
i
believ
and
there
were
question
a
to
whether
he
would
be
abl
to
play
befor
june
and
then
berryhil
wa
ding
up
i
wa
look
forward
to
thi
becaus
i
believ
that
lopez
can
hit
and
field
the
posit
befor
last
season
he
wa
the
brave
defens
catcher
prospect
while
brian
deak
wa
the
brave
offens
catcher
prospect
besid
olson
and
berryhil
couldnt
hit
their
way
out
of
a
wet
cardboard
box
and
dont
walk
enough
to
be
use
but
olson
recov
quickli
berryhil
recov
and
the
brave
went
with
the
two
vet
i
still
say
that
if
one
of
those
two
had
been
down
at
the
start
of
the
season
he
wouldnt
have
gotten
hi
job
back
there
is
a
certain
logic
to
keep
olson
and
berryhil
around
after
all
ml
catcher
are
in
short
suppli
and
suffer
from
wear
and
tear
there
are
team
out
there
without
one
averag
ml
catcher
california
and
seattl
come
to
mind
certainli
tri
to
move
olson
or
berryhil
through
waiver
would
be
unlik
to
work
plu
youd
have
to
eat
that
salari
which
isnt
huge
but
isnt
tiddleywink
either
i
think
olson
at
about
berryhil
at
but
that
onli
what
i
recal
ye
i
think
arbitrationelig
may
have
a
role
to
play
in
thi
also
what
is
it
that
of
the
year
player
arent
elig
for
arbitr
onli
the
that
were
on
the
roster
the
longest
are
elig
of
cours
the
system
may
chang
but
the
extent
of
that
chang
is
not
yet
known
from
a
busi
standpoint
it
may
make
sens
to
keep
lopez
down
until
juneth
first
time
olsonberryhil
go
on
the
dl
i
am
still
disappoint
that
lopez
isnt
on
the
team
i
still
prefer
to
think
of
myself
a
a
fan
when
it
come
to
the
brave
and
the
truth
is
that
id
rather
see
our
best
team
on
the
field
which
imo
includ
lopez
of
coursetoday
we
play
the
cub
hope
we
wont
need
him
a
for
the
schuerholzcox
convers
i
imagin
