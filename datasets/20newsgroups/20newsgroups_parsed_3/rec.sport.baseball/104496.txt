re
dodger
question
the
dodger
have
been
shop
harri
to
other
team
in
their
quest
for
more
lefthand
pitch
so
far
no
taker
person
i
think
harri
is
a
defens
liabil
and
he
ha
also
led
the
team
in
past
year
for
hit
into
doubl
play
or
at
least
been
among
the
leader
sharperson
show
last
year
that
if
given
a
chanc
to
play
everi
day
he
can
get
the
job
done
if
sharpi
play
just
one
base
everi
day
say
third
hed
also
improv
defens
wallach
ha
help
tremend
on
defens
a
ha
reed
the
improv
defens
is
quit
notic
and
is
have
an
effect
on
the
pitch
staff
both
astacio
and
martinez
were
bail
out
in
recent
start
by
great
defens
play
martinez
pitch
into
the
ninth
in
a
game
that
might
have
seen
him
lift
in
the
third
in
past
year
astacio
last
inning
the
other
day
under
similar
circumst
the
dodger
are
turn
doubl
play
and
keep
more
ball
in
the
infield
than
last
year
and
piazza
ha
also
been
great
on
defens
he
ha
thrown
out
of
batter
tri
to
steal
and
ha
at
least
one
pick
off
at
first
wallach
clearli
ha
contribut
to
the
over
all
improv
on
defens
but
hi
offens
is
aw
and
he
ha
cost
the
dodger
some
run
but
i
dont
think
he
is
a
bad
a
hi
current
averag
i
suspect
he
will
come
out
of
thi
slump
much
a
davi
and
straw
seem
to
have
come
out
of
their
dodger
