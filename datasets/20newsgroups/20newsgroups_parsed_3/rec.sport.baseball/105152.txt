i
dont
understand
thi
at
all
matt
william
ha
demonstr
throughout
hi
career
that
he
will
not
wait
for
good
pitch
to
hit
he
wont
take
walk
hed
rather
swing
if
im
the
oppos
pitcher
whi
would
i
groov
a
fastbal
to
william
and
have
him
hit
it
well
when
i
know
that
william
will
swing
and
miss
or
at
least
not
hit
veri
well
at
a
low
and
away
curv
matt
problem
is
realli
more
abil
than
attitud
it
isnt
that
he
got
it
in
hi
mind
that
he
want
to
swing
away
but
rather
that
he
still
a
total
sucker
for
the
curv
ball
it
look
for
a
while
in
that
he
wa
get
better
but
it
still
hi
weak
point
a
to
whether
it
doe
him
ani
good
to
have
bond
behind
him
the
netstatmaven
will
probabl
tell
you
there
no
reason
that
it
should
but
if
he
think
it
will
it
might
be
a

whether
the
giant

best
hitter
fifth
doe
seem
to
be
odd
but
the
and
hitter
arent
exactli
messr
oba
so
they
arent
give
much
up
there
and
although
clark
isnt
the
overal
offens
forc
that
bond
is
he
seem
better
suit
to
the
spot
