roger
maynard
write
it
sure
doe
and
it
all
depend
on
the
definit
that
you
use
for
better
your
is
base
on
what
could
have
been
and
mine
is
base
on
what
realli
happen
well
actual
most
of
our
is
base
on
what
realli
happen
and
your
is
base
on
some
fantasi
of
how
it
happen
but
that
ok
i
understand
you
have
a
hockey
background
stat
like
plusminu
make
rbi
look
good
is
it
viola
fault
that
boston
had
no
offens
is
it
becaus
of
morri
that
the
blue
jay
had
such
a
strong
offens
dont
tell
me
that
morri
ha
thi
magic
abil
to
caus
the
offens
player
to
score
more
run
thi
is
the
perfect
exampl
of
your
problem
you
are
isol
viola
contribut
from
the
rest
of
the
team
effort
you
can
onli
do
thi
if
you
can
say
for
sure
what
the
team
would
have
done
without
viola
onli
then
can
you
compar
but
you
can
not
know
how
the
team
would
have
done
without
viola
your
analysi
is
fallaci
ok
how
about
a
straigh
answer
then
here
a
veri
simel
question
to
which
im
sure
a
fair
number
of
u
are
veri
interes
in
the
answer
to
pleas
answer
ye
or
no
roger
can
a
pitcher
caus
the
offens
player
on
hi
team
to
score
more
run
al
onli
pleas
for
anyon
els
follow
along
it
is
a
wellknown
and
demonstr
fact
that
a
team
winloss
record
is
close
relat
to
the
number
of
run
the
team
score
and
the
number
the
team
allow
it
not
a
definit
hardandfast
function
but
there
is
definit
a
correl
in
fact
a
a
rule
of
thumb
if
team
a
and
b
both
score
x
run
and
team
a
allow
y
run
for
everi
run
fewer
than
y
that
team
b
allow
it
will
win
anoth
game
so
for
instanc
if
we
look
at
the
toronto
blue
jay
we
find
that
they
score
run
and
allow
of
which
morri
allow
all
other
thing
be
equal
if
frank
viola
with
hi
era
had
replac
jack
morri
for
the
inning
morri
threw
plausibl
sinc
viola
threw
for
boston
the
red
jay
would
have
allow
about
fewer
run
or
enough
for
more
win
now
that
doesnt
take
into
account
that
viola
pitch
half
hi
inning
in
fenway
which
is
a
harder
park
to
pitch
in
particularli
for
a
lefthand
than
skydom
so
um
roger
unless
you
realli
do
believ
that
a
pitcher
can
somehow
affect
the
number
of
run
hi
team
score
could
you
enlighten
u
to
the
fallaci
in
thi
analysi
clearli
it
would
be
foolhardi
to
claim
that
viola
would
necessarili
have
put
up
a
if
he
had
been
on
the
jay
last
year
but
that
is
not
the
claim
we
look
at
what
the
actual
perform
were
and
evalu
viola
a
better
than
morri
in
the
sens
that
had
morri
perform
a
viola
did
hi
team
would
have
been
better
off
it
take
an
open
mind
to
realli
truli
understand
what
is
happen
out
here
in
the
real
world
guy
thi
is
true
but
not
so
