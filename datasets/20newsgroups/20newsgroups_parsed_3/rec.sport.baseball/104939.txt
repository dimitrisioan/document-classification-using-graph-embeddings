not
bat
th
sanjeev
punjabi
write
some
evid
that
is
not
work
take
a
look
at
the
stand
it
real
easi
to
get
so
focus
on
minutina
and
forget
that
the
giant
happen
to
be
in
first
place
if
it
work
you
dont
screw
it
up
by
chang
thing
just
becaus
you
think
it
ought
to
be
differ
some
folk
like
to
argu
about
theoret
detail
i
prefer
to
watch
team
win
when
the
giant
slip
to
third
then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrang
the
bat
order
until
then
i
think
it
stupid
to
focu
on
what
wrong
for
the
simpl
fact
that
it
work
a
it
is
p
doe
the
mail
list
maintain
think
that
will
clark
is
the
best
first
baseman
in
the
major
and
that
matt
william
is
a
better
power
hitter
than
ani
other
ballplay
in
the
major
i
dont
follow
al
so
i
wont
comment
on
major
in
the
nl
if
i
had
my
choic
of
ani
b
in
the
leagu
for
my
team
itd
be
clark
and
id
hit
him
third
my
fantasi
team
ha
both
grace
and
murray
on
it
becaus
ive
never
been
abl
to
get
clark
id
take
ani
of
the

without
hesit
in

much
prefer
hi
defens
but
when
he
isnt
headcas
it
matt
ha
a
good
solid
swing
and
some
real
punch
if
he
drop
to

he
wander
out
of
cleanup
but
accord
to
the
latest
basebal
weekli
he
hit
and
in
the
last
week
hit
that

and
frankli
a
long
