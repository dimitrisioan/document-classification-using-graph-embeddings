ive
read
all
of
the
followup
to
thi

i
thought
id
go
back
to
the
origin
articl
to
make
specif
comment
about
the
method
john
oswalt
said
he
ha
obtain
the
play

record
in
comput
readabl
form
for
everi
major
leagu
basebal
game
for
the
past
sever
year
he
devis
an
algorithm
which
i
call
sumoversitu
and
wrote
a
comput
program
to
calcul
everi
major
leagu
player
contribut
use
it
it
work
like
thi
look
at
everi
situat
in
everi
game
in
a
basebal
season
a
situat
is
determin
by
inning
score
where
the
baserunn
are
and
how
mani
out
there
are
for
each
situat
count
how
mani
time
the
team
eventu
won
the
game
that
the
situat
occur
in
and
divid
by
the
number
of
time
the
situat
came
up
to
come
up
with
a
valu
for
that
situat
thi
wa
first
done
by
georg
lindsey
in

pete

did
the
same
thing
use
simul
season
to
gener
a
larger
set
of
data
to
avoid
the
kind
of
smallsampl
anomali
that
other
peopl
have
worri
about
he
report
thi
in
thehiddengameofbasebal
with
john
thorn
gari
skoog
modifi
the
method
a
bit
and
did
some
work
on
what
he
call
a
valu
ad
measur
base
on
these
situat
valu
hi
were
base
directli
on
margin
run
though
not
on

probabl
these
result

were
report
in
one
of
the
bill
jame
basebal
abstract
book
help
me
out
here
somebodi
for
exampl
a
situat
might
be
inning
score
runner
on
second
and
no
out
there
were
regular
season
major
leagu
game
last
year
with
the
rocki
and
marlin
there
will
be
more
thi
year
say
thi
situat
came
up
in
of
those
and
the
team
ahead
won
of
them
then
the
valu
of
thi
situat
is
descript
of
method
look
at
chang
in
win
probabl
base
on
the
at
bat
plu
ani
baserun
and
creditdebit
the
player
by
that
amount
each
time
he
get
a
plate
appear
now
for
each
player
sum
up
all
hi
atbat
and
baserun
valu
for
the
season
to
obtain
an
overal
valu
for
that
player
obvious
the
sum
of
all
player
valu
for
each
game
and
for
the
season
a
a
whole
will
be
that
onli
becaus
you
alway
credit
x
to
the
batter
and
x
to
the
pitcher
there
no
valid
involv
ok
there
a
veri
big
problem
here
that
nobodi
ha
yet
comment
on
your
ad
probabl
and
probabl
dont
add
run
you
can
add
the
total
team
run
break
down
into
how
mani
run
joe
contribut
plu
how
mani
run
fred
contribut
etc
but
probabl
dont
work
that
way
if
bob
increas
hi
team
chanc
of
win
by
in
each
of
pa
that
doe
not
mean
that
bob
increas
hi
team
chanc
of
win
by
in
fact
it
doesnt
mean
anyth
becaus
the
unit
are
screwi
i
agre
and
disagre
john
is
say
that
the
batter
effort
will
result
in
more
win
then
loss
while
you
are
probabl
correct
that
doe
not
mean
more
win
then
loss
it
mean
someth
i
would
rather
have
a
player
who
increas
my
team
chanc
of
win
by
in
each
of
pa
then
i
would
a
player
who
increas
my
chanc
of
win
by
in
each
of
pa
thu
there
appear
to
me
to
be
an
obviou
posit
associ
between
john
statist
and
win
game
thu
befor
you
disregard
thi
stat
it
appear
to
me
that
further
studi
must
go
into
what
sort
of
relationship
there
is
consid
an
exampl
bob
hit
a
out
solo
hr
in
the
bottom
of
the
first
about
on
your
scale
he
doe
the
same
thing
again
in
the
fourth
with
the
score
tie
for
anoth
and
again
in
the
seventh
with
the
score
tie
for
anoth
and
final
in
the
ninth
to
win
the
game
by
a
score
of
for
a
valu
of
bob
hit
solo
hr
in
plate
appear
and
wa
credit
by
your
method
with
but
what
doe
that
mean
wa
bob
respons
for
the
win
certainli
not
the
defens
is
alway
respons
if
you
includ
pitch
in
that
and
bob
wasnt
pitch
in
fact
bob
wa
onli
of
the
offens
which
is
a
lot
but
not
even
close
to
furthermor
what
about
the
other
team
run
say
they
all
came
on
solo
hr
by
fred
then
fred
wa
hit
hr
to
tie
up
the
game
which
are
just
a
valuabl
a
hr
to
take
the
lead
see
lindsey
and
fred
will
himself
have
accru
a
good
rate
or
so
so
fred
and
bob
combin
have
amass
of
a
win
in
one
game
there
clearli
a
problem
here
the
onli
problem
here
is
an
insist
that
these
number
mean
exactli
how
mani
win
the
team
ha
first
we
are
use
averag
over
mani
season
and
appli
them
to
one
game
second
rememb
some
player
perform
take
away
from
the
chanc
of
you
win
that
is
a
player
who
get
an
out
get
a
neg
probabl
in
most
case
thu
im
not
sure
in
ani
given
game
when
you
add
up
all
the
number
for
a
team
who
won
that
they
will
add
up
to
in
that
game
sometim
they
will
add
up
to
more
then
one
sometim
le
than
one
also
the
pitcher
bad
perform
give
up
run
may
have
given
them
a
larg
neg
percentag
for
that
game
also
ani
batter
that
pull
an
night
would
give
larg
neg
greg
think
about
the
right
thing
but
hi
intuit
is
off
the
mark
closer
are
enorm
import
the
total
number
of
run
valu
is
outweigh
by
when
they
come
or
are
prevent
from
com
the
doubl
which
greg
allow
is
not
enough
in
anoth
articl
i
propos
a
test
of
thi
we
can
predict
a
team
wonlost
record
quit
accur
by
look
at
how
mani
run
total
they
score
and
allow
without
regard
to
when
those
run
score
in
the
game
if
late
run
are
realli
more
import
than
earli
run
then
look
onli
at
late
run
should
lead
to
a
better
predictor
right
no
but
realli
onli
becaus
you
have
a
smaller
sampl
size
i
would
think
howev
that
the
number
of
run
you
score
in
the
first
inning
would
be
just
a
good
a
a
predict
a
how
mani
run
you
score
in
the
last
inning
and
realiz
someth
els
a
closer
usual
come
in
in
a
close
situat
not
a
blow
out
it
is
hard
to
argu
that
ani
run
that
a
closer
give
up
in
a
game
have
equal
import
to
those
given
up
in
the
first
inning
look
a
closer
give
up
run
often
mean
a
team
will
lose
mani
game
on
the
other
hand
a
starter
who
give
up
run
often
still
leaf
hi
team
a
chanc
to
win
the
offenc
ha
mani
more
out
to
do
someth
about
but
i
am
not
say
all
late
inning
situat
are
equal
import
either
if
i
am
down
run
in
the
ninth
it
realli
doe
not
matter
how
mani
run
my
pitcher
give
up
in
the
ninth
here
anoth
thought
experi
appli
thi
method
to
basketbal
what
you
find
is
that
point
score
in
the
first
half
of
the
game
have
almost
exactli
no
valu
becaus
no
lead
is
safe
with
an
entir
half
yet
to
play
furthermor
the
sub
in
off
the
bench
who
sink
the
win
free
throw
with
no
time
on
the
clock
get
a
for
the
game
while
the
star
forward
who
score
point
in
the
first
half
befor
sprain
hi
ankl
get
a
zero
doe
thi
make
sens
no
but
whi
would
you
assum
that
the
team
probabl
of
win
would
be
befor
the
posses
in
which
the
free
throw
were
made
look
if
you
are
down
point
with
second
left
there
is
a
fairli
high
probabl
that
you
will
win
the
game
if
you
are
in
posses
of
the
ball
and
do
not
forget
that
somebodi
el
miss
shot
turnov
foul
bad
defens
etc
caus
a
neg
chanc
that
the
team
would
win
from
read
all
of
the
discuss
on
thi
statist
i
feel
that
those
who
critis
it
to
a
certain
extent
are
do
so
out
of
an
agenda
at
first
look
thi
statist
valad
clutch
but
it
realli
doe
not
cluth
revolv
around
the
idea
that
certain
player
in
crucial
situat
elev
their
perform
and
other
perform
go
down
ive
never
seen
convinc
proof
that
thi
realli
happen
so
if
you
assum
there
is
no
clutch
then
that
mean
that
except
for
a
lot
of
noic
thi
statist
ha
a
posit
associ
to
player
perform
there
is
a
way
to
get
rid
of
the
noic
if
you
do
not
believ
in
clutch
certainli
we
could
find
out
what
the
averag
valu
of
a
home
run
is
for
exampl
we
may
find
for
instanc
that
a
home
run
increas
your
chanc
of
win
by
on
averag
while
a
strikeout
decreas
your
chanc
of
win
by
i
bet
if
thi
were
done
we
would
find
that
thi
statist
wa
just
a
good
a
other
statist
we
have
for
predict
win
and
loss
how
do
we
evalu
relief
pitcher
say
john
and
sam
have
the
exact
same
pitch
statist
run
earn
run
k
bb
etc
both
had
except
number
john
howev
onli
pitch
in
closer
situat
while
sam
wa
a
mop
up
man
who
wa
more
valubl
to
their
team
probabl
john
who
wa
the
better
pitcher
they
were
probabl
about
the
same
