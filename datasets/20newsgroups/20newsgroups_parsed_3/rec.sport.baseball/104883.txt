he
an
adequ

although
not

at

some
of
your

by
watch
him
learn
to
play
the
of
at
the
ml
level
i
know
your
anoth
longterm
brave
fan
about
play
bimo
that
the
nd
most
difficult
posit
to
field
after
catcher
at
s
or
b
you
need
more
rang
and
speed
but
at
b
youv
got
to
have
quick
reflex
and
have
a
gun
for
an
arm
there
are
no
second
chanc
at
b
even
when
play
sandlot
softbal
grant
id
still
put
my
best
overal
infield
at
s
but
that
becaus
he
get
more
chanc
not
becaus
the
job
is
harder
it
still
amaz
me
that
so
mani
team
have
tri
to
convert
other
posit
player
to
b
but
mayb
that
becaus
the
suppli
of
natur
b
is
scarc
final
gant
is
a
player
who
put
pressur
on
himself
to
perform
well
and
work
hard
to
improv
you
dont
get
those
amazingli
huge
arm
on
that
rel
small
bodi
without
a
lot
of
weight
work
now
whether
he
been
overdo
it
these
day
may
be
a
valid
question
a
is
the
question
of
whether
he
tri
too
hard
to
make
someth
happen
dure
each
atbat
but
frankli
if
a
player
is
go
to
not
live
up
to
potenti
id
much
rather
they
fail
by
tri
too
hard
than
by
not
tri
hard
enough
you
might
be
abl
to
teach
relax
to
an
adult
but
at
that
age
i
dont
believ
you
can
teach
hustl
all
that
said
i
dont
think
id
sign
gant
to
anoth
longterm
contract
he
now
and
i
think
he
freeagent
elig
in
year
when
hell
be
given
hi
career
curv
and
limit
i
wouldnt
expect
him
to
last
much
past
a
a
ml
ballplay
he
might
surpris
me
here
but
atlanta
got
some
talent
on
the
farm
and
id
rather
take
my
chanc
down
the
road
