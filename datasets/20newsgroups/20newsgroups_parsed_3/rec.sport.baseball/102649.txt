i
find
it
total
amaz
for
you
to
suggest
that
thi
yearold
with
three
season
of
profession
basebal
is
now
better
than
olson
a
fiveyear
mlb
veteran
who
is
note
for
hi
abil
to
call
a
game
and
who

arm
oh
perhap
you
are
talk
about
hit
well
sure
lopez
might
hit
better
perhap
he
probabl
will
but
ha
there
ever
in
the
histori
of
basebal
been
a
yearold
or
younger
rooki
catcher
who
compar
favor
among
all
leagu

i
can
continu
thi
thread
with

you
get
the
point
you

to
be
so
quick
to
dismiss
