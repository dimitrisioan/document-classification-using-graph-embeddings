re
the
philli
deja
vu
previous
i
wrote
yeah
the
philli
play
over
their
head
almost
the
whole
year
but
it
all
caught
up
to
them
in
one
game
streak
i
am
a
old
a
man
and
i
wa
a
big
philli
fan
at
the
time
age
septemb
is
still
a
pain
thing
to
rememb
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
philli
never
led
the
leagu
by
that
year
go
by
memori
alon
i
believ
their
biggest
lead
wa
game
and
they
were
ahead
when
the
famou
game
lose
streak
began
a
streak
dure
which
it
seem
that
they
found
just
about
everi
way
to
lose
known
to
man
anyway
i
think
they
rebound
just
befor
the
end
and
won
their
last
coupl
game
and
were
still
in
the
thing
until
the
final
day
but
finish
tie
with
the
giant
one
game
out
and
didnt
the
dodger
or
somebodi

finish
two

ha
to
be
one
of
the
closest
last

now
it
doesnt

me
that

overus
at

by
the

rotat
standard
of
the

at

mauch
wa

the

the

they
were

at

may
have
made
the

wors
although

had
one

hi
sharpest

in

stack
up
against
the
rest
of

also
notic
that
the

play
everi

from
at

septemb
through
octob

they
didnt
