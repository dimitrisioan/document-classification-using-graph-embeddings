predict
the
futur
it
ha
been
entir
meaningless
at
least
if
it
ha
mean
we
dont
know
how
to
find
it
i
did
not
say
i
could
predict
the
futur
you
most
certainli
did
i
realli
dont
want
to
get
into
a
didsodidnot
debat
with
you
but
thi
is
somewhat
at
the
heart
of
our
disagr
i
did
not
say
nor
did
i
impli
that
i
could
predict
the
futur
you
have
infer
that
my
comment
meant
thi
and
you
have
base
your
rebutt
of
my
comment
on
the
fact
that
statist
studi
have
demonstr
that
there
is
no
reason
basi
for
predict
futur
perform
in
regard
to
clutch
hit
sabo
samuel
sabo
is
clearli
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
yet
you
would
pinchhit
samuel
becaus
you
predict
that
samuel
will
be
a
clutch
hitter
and
sabo
will
be
a
choke
hitter
right
id
call
that
predict
the
futur
that
is
your
opinion
that
sabo
is
clearli
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
the
abov
data
is
for
a
year
period
end
last
season
last
season
samuel
bat
while
sabo
hit
not
park
adjust
thi
season
they
are
both
hit
below
albeit
sabo
with
more
at
bat
i
will
agre
that
over
hi
career
sabo
ha
been
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
but
i
will
also
remind
you
that
samuel
ha
been
a
better
hitter
in
certain
situat
than
sabo
i
did
not
predict
that
sabo
would
choke
nor
that
samuel
would
get
a
hit
i
express
my
opinion
that
had
i
been
the
red
manag
or
even
a
red
fan
that
i
would
prefer
to
have
samuel
hit
in
that
situat
than
sabo
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
red
manag
at
that
time
i
assum
you
would
have
had
some
basi
for
let
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hit
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basi
would
have
util
prior
perform
you
just
wouldnt
have
use
thi
particular
aspect
of
prior
perform
is
thi
not
correct
right
i
would
have
use
aspect
of
prior
perform
which
have
been
shown
to
be
consist
in
the
past
overal
perform
lr
split
even
match
hittingpitch
style
all
of
these
will
give
me
some
advantag
if
use
properli
ah
properli
ye
i
see
even
if
all
els
were
equal
there
would
be
no
advantag
gain
by
look
at
past
clutch
perform
and
in
thi
case
everyth
els
point
to
sabo
pleas
help
me
what
exactli
is
everyth
els
that
point
to
sabo
well
ye
you
are
awar
of
it
exist
you
claim
to
be
incap
of
understand
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simpli
unwil
yet
you
rather
forc
state
the
opposit
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
read
yet
you
obvious
feel
the
topic
is
import
id
say
thi
is
insult
i
must
say
i
wa
not
awar
of
the
public
can
you
email
me
the
inform
regard
it
avail
and
i
guess
i
must
apolog
to
all
of
those
who
have
done
extens
studi
on
say
suppli
side
econom
i
didnt
mean
to
insult
you
but
i
never
did
believ
you
were
on
the
right
path
im
sorri
for
my
contrari
opinionposit
i
also
regret
that
i
dont
have
the
abil
to
prove
that
you
are
wrong
but
you
are
i
believ
that
by
season
end
that
chri
sabo
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
will
be
significantli
lower
than
hi
bat
averag
in
nonclutch
situat
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
thi
simpli
a
predict
for
chri
sabo
for
thi
year
or
is
thi
a
predict
for
all
batter
who
have
over
the
past
few
year
hit
xxx
amount
wors
in
the
clutch
than
overal
it
is
what
it
say
it
is
if
you
mean
the
first
then
a
you
say
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
but
the
second
is
a
much
stronger
statement
in
fact
it
suggest
a
rule
we
can
then
test
thi
rule
on
past
data
to
see
if
it
work
for
recent
year
i
think
you
will
agre
that
if
the
rule
didnt
work
last
year
or
the
year
befor
that
it
is
unlik
to
do
ani
better
thi
year
right
the
second
is
your
statement
not
mine
im
not
go
to
get
into
case
analysi
sure
you
can
find
somebodi
who
hit
poorli
from
and
then
hit
poorli
in
a
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorli
from
and
then
hit
well
in
well
actual
i
havent
yet
but
im
not
finish
look
that
is
i
havent
yet
found
someon
who
hit
significantli
below
hi
overal
bat
averag
in
clutch
situat
for
the
year
and
then
revers
that
relationship
in
gambler
fallaci
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consist
a
run
prof
noth
can
you
give
u
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correl
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detail
studi
of
whi
i
shouldnt
expect
it
to
correl
nope
sorri
but
if
you
were
interest
in
a
reason
whi
i
expect
chri
sabo
abil
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correl
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
if
you
were
interest
in
a
reason
whi
i
expect
joe
carter
abil
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correl
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
but
your
not
interest
in
that
becaus
you
think
that
those
conclus
could
onli
be
valid
if
they
could
be
extrapol
over
the
entir
basebal
popul
and
they
cant
be
the
stupid
wa
in
refer
to
a
statement
which
wa
stupid
and
i
dont
see
how
you
can
deni
it
a
for
total
idiot
ye
if
you
prove
yourself
unwil
to
even
consid
evid
that
might
suggest
that
you
are
wrong
i
would
say
the
term
fit
nice
the
problem
here
is
that
i
do
believ
you
i
accept
your
work
i
believ
that
tri
to
predict
futur
clutch
perform
base
on
prior
clutch
histori
is
meaningless
no
better
than
a
coin
toss
i
actual
do
accept
your
work
a
it
happen
i
also
have
an
opinion
that
in
certain
situat
for
certain
player
a
histori
of
superior
or
inferior
abil
to
hit
in
the
clutch
might
suggest
a
reason
what
such
histori
could
be
valid
in
project
futur
player
perform
for
that
player
and
chri
sabo
is
one
such
player
so
tell
me
doe
the
term
fit
or
do
you
have
an
open
mind
well
sinc
i
defer
to
your
statist
wisdom
i
think
i
must
have
an
open
mind
now
we
have
to
pose
the
same
question
to
you
