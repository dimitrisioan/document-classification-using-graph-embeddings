even
i
believ
acker
got
a

from
hi
wife
when
they
were
marri
the
blue
jay
had
such
a
strong
offens
dont
tell
me

ha
thi
magic
abil
to
caus
the
offens
player
to
score
more
run
i
dont
know
whi
you
guy
keep
bicker
about
morri
the
stat
show
he
is
a
mediocr
pitcher
at
best
thi
year
is
anoth
case
he
just
happen
to
win
game
i
saw
mani
of
hi
game
last
year
he
did
pitch
some
good
game
but
thi
crap
about
be
a
clutch
pitcher
is
nonsens
he
wa
constantli
give
up
go
ahead
run
in
the
th
inning
the
clutch
inning
and
the
jay
would
somehow
scrape
a
win
for
him
anoth
major
factor
in
hi
win
is
that
cito
i
dont
realiz
i
have
a
bullpen
gaston

leav
morri
in
for
ever
therefor
give
him
mani
more
chanc
to
win
game
i
believ
thi
is
the
major
reason
he
won
game
