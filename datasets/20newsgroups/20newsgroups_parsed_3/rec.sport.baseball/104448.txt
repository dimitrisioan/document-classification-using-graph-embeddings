in

articl
sean
sweda
say
ive
been
say
thi
for
quit
some
time
but
be
absent
from
the
net
for
a
while
i
figur
id
stick
my
neck
out
a
bit
the
royal
will
set
the
record
for
fewest
run
score
by
an
al
team
sinc
the
incept
of
the
dh
rule
p
ani
idea
what
thi
is
they
will
fall
easili
short
of
run
that
for
damn
sure
i
cant
believ
these
medium
fool
pick
them
to
win
the
divis
like
our
tom
gage
of
the
detroit
news
claim
herk
robinson
is
some
kind
of
geniu
for
the
tradesaquisit
he
made
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
dodger
in
or
true
cone
is
probabl
a
good
a
drysdal
and
they
have
no
koufax
but
still
these
team
were
win
with
home
run
leader
who
had
veri
bad
total
with
lot
of
lowscor
game
etc
and
they
didnt
use
reliev
wherea
jeff
montgomeri
is
have
a
super
season
for
them
that
be
said
i
still
pick
them
th
or
so
but
i
think
a
superb
pitch
team
can
win
if
they
have
enough
hit
there
more
of
a
chanc
of
that
i
think
than
of
a
team
with
tremend
hit
but
no
pitch
at
least
to
me
i
wonder
though
which
one
do
you
peopl
think
would
do
better
a
team
with
johnson
koufax
in
hi
prime
seaver
carlton
and
young
in
no
real
order
a
the
starter
with
sutter
finger
and
lyle
in
the
bullpen
but
with
a
puni
offens
assum
good
defens
like
mazeroski
maranvil
etc
or
a
team
with
poor
pitch
but
with
an
offens
of
cobb
carew
ruth
gehrig
may
schmidt
wagner
and
bench
againy
pick
the
order
i
would
postul
that
the
pitch
one
would
be
sever
game
better
by
season
end
even
the
best
hitter
can
succeed
onli
of
the
time
in
their
best
year
but
a
great
pitcher
can
throw
lot
of
shutout
take
all
the
player
in
their
prime
they
might
throw
shutout
in
a
year
and
all
the
offens
would
have
to
do
is
get
run
across
i
wonder
if
someon
with
stratomat
or
someth
could
plug
such
all
time
team
into
a
regular
season
have
it
play
and
report
the
result
i
would
love
to
see
that
doug
fowler
me
age
now
mommi
and
daddi
other
ever
wonder
if
after
casey
rel
have
to
give
lot
of
hug
love
miss
the
rd
strike
in
the
poem
support
caus
heaven
is
just
a
great
he
ran
to
first
and
made
it
big
hug
that
last
forev
and
ever
