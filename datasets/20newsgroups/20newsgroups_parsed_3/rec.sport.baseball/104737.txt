write
and
final
id
like
to
point
out
that
mani
high
obp
guy
draw
their
walk
more
becaus
pitcher
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
becaus
they
have
a
great
eye
thi
come
up
period
and
i
just
dont
get
it
take
for
exampl
mark
mcgwire

what
is
now
let
look
at
what
happen
when
mcgwire
doesnt
walk
of
the
time
he
made
an
out
of
the
time
he
hit
a
singl
of
the
time
he
hit
a
doubl
of
the
time
he
hit
a
homer
now
your
pitch
against
mcgwire
would
you
trade
walk
for
homer
doubl
singl

would
whi
give
him
the
base
