piec
of
evid
we
can
find
point
to
major
leagu
basebal
be
offens
defens
a
run
score
is
just
a
import
a
a
run
prevent
thi
certainli
pas
the
common
sen
test
for
me
but
is
there
ani
statist
evid
to
say
what
percent
of
defens
is
pitch
and
what
percent
is
field
id
realli
like
to
know
btw
sherri
thank
for
the
da
data
i
find
it
fascin
of
cours
a
run
score
is
just
a
import
a
a
run
prevent
just
a
a
penni
save
is
a
penni
earn
enough
with
the
clich
my
point
is
that
if
the
brave
starter
are
abl
to
live
up
to
their
potenti
they
wont
need
much
offens
support
i
realiz
thi
is
a
big
if
thi
staff
leav
the
bosox
in
the
dust
there
is
no
legitim
comparison
two
cy
young
winner
and
three
other
pitcher
that
most
ani
team
in
the
leagu
would
kill
to
have
a
their
first
or
second
starter
it
seem
to
me
that
when
qualiti
pitcher
take
the
mound
the
other
team
score
le
run
the
team
that
score
the
most
run
win
thi
put
the
team
with
the
better
pitch
at
the
advantag
provid
they
can
stop
the
oppos
team
from
score
run
a
low
score
game
would
clearli
benefit
the
brave
they
should
have
mani
low
score
game
due
to
their
excel
pitch
and
below
averag
hit
on
the
flip
side
if
you
had
a
start
lineup
of
great
offens
player
i
would
be
argu
that
thi
team
would
not
need
great
pitcher
they
would
have
an
advantag
becaus
they
could
simpli
outscor
their
oppon
the
name
of
the
game
is
to
win
even
ray
knight
know
that
you
do
thi
by
put
more
run
up
on
the
scoreboard
all
im
tri
to
say
is
that
if
you
assembl
the
qualiti
pitcher
like
the
brave
have
the
offens
doesnt
need
to
be
a
strong
