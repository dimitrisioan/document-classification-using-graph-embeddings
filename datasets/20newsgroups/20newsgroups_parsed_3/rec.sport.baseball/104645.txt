re
jack
morri
in
david
robert
walker
write
we
can
not
isol
complet
roger
but
we
can
make
a
pretti
good
estim
i
wont
claim
to
split
hair
and
say
that
we
can
realli
measur
who
wa
better
robbi
alomar
or
carlo
baerga
last
year
the
differ
is
too
close
to
call
but
larkin
and
lee
clemen
and
morri
the
differ
are
too
great
there
in
your
measur
of
the
game
whi
should
a
team
that
ha
just
won
it
all
ever
replac
a
singl
player
sinc
they
are
now
clearli
best
how
can
they
do
better
yet
everi
team
can
alway
find
someplac
where
they
beleiv
they
can
improv
the
team
they
can
alway
find
a
player
a
littl
better
than
one
they
alreadi
have
btw
by
my
definit
the
best
player
is
the
one
who
doe
the
most
thing
to
help
hi
team
win
i
will
allow
that
thi
could
vari
depend
on
who
els
is
on
the
team
by
have
aptitud
one
team
need
more
than
other
well
then
given
your
definit
of
best
is
it
not
conceiv
that
alfredo
griffin
could
bring
someth
to
a
team
that
that
team
need
to
win
while
larkin
might
not
have
that
someth
the
team
need
would
griffin
then
be
better
than
larkin
basebal
is
a
team
game
but
it
is
made
of
individu
talent
it
is
absurd
to
judg
the
success
or
failur
of
an
individu
by
the
success
or
failur
of
hi
teammat
whom
he
did
not
choos
at
least
in
most
case
morri
won
last
year
becaus
he
play
on
a
team
with
joe
carter
robbi
alomar
tom
henk
juan
guzman
john
olerud
et
al
clemen
lost
becaus
he
wa
surround
by
such
lesser
perform
a
herm
winninham
lui
rivera
and
jeff
reardon
to
defin
the
qualiti
of
the
team
a
a
sum
of
it
compon
a
i
do
albeit
imperfectli
is
a
lesser
error
than
defin
the
qualiti
of
an
individu
a
the
mean
qualiti
of
the
team
a
my
read
of
your
argument
suggest
you
do
no
i
am
not
tri
to
defin
the
qualiti
of
an
individu
at
least
not
for
the
purpos
of
rank
them
toronto
won
with
olerud
they
might
have
won
with
fielder
they
might
not
have
won
with
thoma
detroit
might
have
won
with
thoma
chicago
might
have
won
with
fielder
you
cant
rank
these
individu
you
can
onli
look
at
who
might
contribut
more
to
the
team
effort
which
is
win
the
w
thoma
could
not
have
contribut
to
that
goal
ani
more
than
olerud
so
i
can
not
say
that
olerud
is
le
of
a
player
cordial
a
alway
so
mani
moron
rm
and
so
littl
time
