ted
fischer
write
im
still
catch
up
from
spring
break
but
bear
with
me
in
the
big
especi
when
they
havent
even
play
aaa
ball
we
certainli
believ
thi
kid
is
go
to
be
veri
good
some
day
but
there
is
realli
no
need
to
rush
him
especi
sinc
we
have
a
mega
million
dollar
staff
that
is
probabl
well
serv
by
a
batterym
who
is
expereienc
in
game
call
and
pitcher
handl
lopez
time
will
come
let
give
him
some
time
in
aaa
javi
lopez
ha
proven
over
ab
in
the
minor
leagu
that
he
is
readi
to
play
in
the
major
he
is
not
be
rush
player
who
are
clearli
too
good
for
aa
and
play
behind
stiff
at
the
major
leagu
level
are
wast
their
time
and
may
actual
have
a
court
case
against
major
leagu
manag
for
keep
them
at
aaa
no
mayb
i
need
to
improv
my
write
skill
lopez
who
is
veri
ordinari
defens
is
not
like
to
hit
so
well
at
age
unless
lopez
is
me
defens
im
and
born
to
play
second
base
he
belong
in
the
major
leagu
train
what
doe
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chanc
mayb
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
coupl
start
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
hi
worth
gee
i
dont
know
ab
sound
pretti
good
to
me
about
a
good
a
your
reason
that
the
kid
should
play
a
backup
role
rather
than
start
everi
day
at
aaa
talk
about
me
a
a
gm
valentin
isnt
say
he
should
back
up
he
say
he
should
be
put
in
a
posit
to
win
the
job
in
the
major
leagu
which
imho
he
would
if
given
the
opportun
val
if
im
misinterpret
plea
let
me
know
so
far
you
have
come
up
with
two
argument
against
lopez
he
is
veri
ordinari
defens
he
is
young
and
most
player
suck
when
they
are
young
the
first
is
irrelev
he
tri
to
make
the
major
with
hi
bat
and
the
second
involv
serious
warp
reason
valentin
ok
most
player
are
not
readi
for
the
big
at
age
see
current
relat
post
on
clayton
one
of
my
favorit
most
player
benefit
rather
than
be
stagnant
or
hurt
by
play
at
aaa
most
catcher
need
to
be
solid
defens
player
to
help
their
club
in
the
big
those
are
the
argument
against
lopez
for
the
brave
for
thi
year
but
the
player
who
are
readi
are
the
best
and
the
one
most
like
to
benefit
from
be
in
the
major
javi
lopez
is
not
a
middl
oftheroad
prospect
he
the
real
thing
now
again
the
most
import
thing
a
player
can
do
is
hit
lopez
doe
that
mile
better
than
olson
or
berryhil
if
hi
defens
is
good
enough
for
greenvil
or
richmond
it
good
enough
for
atlanta
if
he
realli
wa
aw
defens
he
would
no
longer
be
a
catcher
see
spragu
ed
now
the
brave
have
two
catcher
who
have
demonstr
solid
abil
to
call
game
to
work
with
the
pitcher
to
throw
out
runner
not
superstar
mind
you
but
solid
experienc
veteran
the
brave
have
a
veri
solid
lineup
with
two
big
bat
in
the
outfield
an
excel
platoon
at
first
a
solid
mvp
candid
at
third
and
one
of
the
better
hit
shortstop
the
center
field
platoon
will
probabl
hit
howev
good
lopez
what
they
have
to
offset
the
differenti
in
experi
and
defens
abil
the
kid
will
improv
play
at
aaa
and
he
probabl
wont
be
a
reserv
with
the
big
club
oh
where
to
start
ok
first
of
all
solid
good
i
want
good
player
solid
is
one
of
those
word
use
to
describ
nice
white
guy
who
realli
arent
veri
good
at
basebal
think
of
it
a
twg
without
the
cap
it
a
lose
strategi
to
say
we
have
solid
guy
we
dont
need
to
improv
you
use
it
four
time
in
that
paragraph
btw
same
for
experienc
i
might
add
though
that
greg
olson
and
damon
berryhil
arent
exactli
carter
and
fisk
olson
ha
play
three
year
berryhil
five
although
and
were
a
wash
the
onli
differ
imho
between
olson
and
vall
is
the
support
cast
two
big
bat
hrm
i
like
justic
but
i
find
mr
gant
trend
