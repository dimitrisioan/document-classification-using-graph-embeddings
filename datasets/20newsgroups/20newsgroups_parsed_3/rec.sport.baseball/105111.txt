i
watch
the
final
inning
of
bosio
nohitt
with
sever
peopl
at
work
after
vizquel
made
that
barehand
grab
of
the
chopper
up
the
middl
someon
remark
that
if
he
had
field
it
with
hi
glove
he
wouldnt
have
had
time
to
throw
rile
out
yet
the
throw
beat
rile
by
about
two
step
i
wonder
how
mani
other
who
watch
the
final
out
think
vizquel
had
no
choic
but
to
make
the
play
with
hi
bare
hand
in
thi
morn
paper
or
wa
it
on
the
radio
vizquel
wa
quot
a
say
that
he
could
have
field
the
ball
with
hi
glove
and
still
easili
thrown
out
rile
that
he
barehand
it
instead
so
a
to
make
the
final
play
more
memor
seem
a
litl
cocki
to
me
but
he
made
it
work
so
he
entitl
i
guess
so
still
that
kind
of
a
stupid
move
imo
hed
be
sing
a
differ
tune
if
he
had
boot
it
and
the
next
guy
up
had
hit
a
bloop
singl
stranger
thing
have
happen
hey

use
to
be
a
big
dave
