isbut
whi
in
write
you
are
absolut
correct
brave
fan
are
noth
but
a
bunch
of
bandwagon
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
or
year
ago
you
couldnt
give
away
a
ticket
to
see
the
brave
playi
would
bet
my
next
paycheck
that
of
the
socal
brave
fan
live
outsid
of
georgia
at
the
present
time
can
not
name
more
than
player
from
their
season
on
the
other
hand
ask
ani
cub
fan
live
anywher
in
the
unit
state
to
name
player
from
ani
given
year
and
of
them
probabl
could
you
could
be
right
then
again
you
could
be
wrong
thi
claim
is
complet
unverifi
and
untest
id
wager
most
of
the
brave
fan
on
the
net
could
name
more
than
player
from
their
season
you
could
give
away
ticket
to
brave
game
howev
my
dad
and
i
were
abl
to
get
great
seat
from
scalper
for
face
valu
which
isnt
exactli
the
sign
of
a
hot
ticket
grant
the
fact
that
a
team
win
bring
peopl
to
the
ball
park
but
that
doe
not
mean
they
diserv
the
titl
america
team
the
onli
reason
they
are
consid
america
team
is
becaus
of
ted
turner
and
hi
littl
tv
station
which
broadcast
across
the
nation
thi
is
precis
whi
they
were
consid
america
team
even
especi
when
they
were
bad
you
could
see
most
of
the
brave
game
on
cabl
you
could
do
that
for
the
cub
a
well
but
the
brave
had
better
camerawork
better
announc
what
would
you
rather
listen
to
harri
discus
the
game
or
skip
and
pete
discus
motobal
and
team
that
werent
too
much
wors
becaus
of
tb
the
brave
had
a
lot
of
fan
outsid
of
georgia
at
home
in
kentucki
even
though
we
were
much
closer
to
cincinnati
there
wa
a
mani
brave
fan
a
red
fan
even
in
you
could
actual
watch
the
brave
play
you
had
to
go
to
cincinnati
to
watch
the
red
i
can
go
anywher
in
america
and
watch
the
brave
ill
consid
toronto
america
team
befor
the
brave
whi
id
guess
that

more
wide
distribut
than
toronto
fan

fanat
it
is
consid
good
to
