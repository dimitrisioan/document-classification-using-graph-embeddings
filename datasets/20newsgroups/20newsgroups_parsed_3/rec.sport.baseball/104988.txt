mark
singer
write
actual
i
think
the
largescal
sampl
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seem
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
player
in
basebal
in
regard
to
ba
v
clutch
ba
deviat
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curv
the
xaxi
be
the
deviat
in
clutch
hit
v
nonclutch
the
yaxi
be
the
number
of
player
certainli
there
would
be
some
player
on
the
extrem
end
of
the
bell
right
most
definit
my
supposit
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
player
consist
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
abl
to
make
some
reason
conclus
about
those
player
a
oppos
to
all
basebal
player
thi
may
be
the
root
of
the
confus
plea
consid
the
follow
hypothet
with
an
open
mind
note
that
i
am
not
yet
say
that
it
ha
anyth
to
do
with
the
question
at
hand
suppos
we
have
a
simplifi
lotto
game
you
pick
a
number
from
and
win
if
that
number
is
drawn
suppos
we
have
a
larg
popul
of
peopl
who
play
thi
game
everi
week
in
the
first
year
of
the
game
approxim
of
the
popul
will
win
or
more
time
in
the
second
year
of
the
game
of
those
time
winner
will
again
be
time
winner
in
the
third
year
of
the
game
of
those
who
won
or
more
time
in
each
of
the
first
two
year
will
win
again
suppos
i
start
with
peopl
in
my
popul
after
three
year
i
have
peopl
who
have
consist
in
each
of
the
last
three
year
won
or
more
the
number
of
time
expect
do
we
expect
them
to
be
big
winner
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
game
no
becaus
we
know
there
is
no
skill
involv
noth
about
these
consist
winner
can
influenc
their
chanc
of
win
but
suppos
we
dont
know
whether
or
not
there
is
a
chanc
that
skill
might
be
involv
perhap
some
of
the
peopl
in
our
popul
are
psychic
or
someth
how
would
we
test
thi
hypothesi
we
can
look
for
correl
in
the
popul
now
most
of
the
popul
will
show
zero
correl
but
our
psychic
should
show
a
high
posit
correl
even
if
they
arent
veri
good
psychic
they
should
still
manag
to
win
or
more
time
most
year
net
result
a
small
posit
correl
over
the
entir
popul
thi
probabl
bring
u
to
the
heart
of
the
disagr
i
am
have
with
other
on
thi
topic
must
ani
conclus
base
on
statist
histori
be
abl
to
be
appli
broadli
throughout
a
data
base
befor
it
ha
ani
valid
is
it
imposs
or
irrat
to
appli
statist
analysi
to
select
compon
of
the
data
base
well
zero
correl
is
zero
correl
you
mention
that
sabo
ha
hit
poorli
in
the
clutch
over
the
last
year
but
if
we
look
at
the
past
we
find
that
clutch
pattern
are
just
a
like
to
revers
a
they
are
to
remain
consist
the
length
of
the
streak
doesnt
seem
to
make
a
differ
to
the
probabl
that
the
player
will
be
clutch
or
choke
the
next
year
is
there
ani
reason
to
expect
thi
streak
to
be
differ
from
past
streak
now
if
it
were
true
that
of
all
threeyear
streak
remain
true
to
form
then
we
might
have
someth
use
but
then
we
wouldnt
have
zero
correl
instead
we
have
of
all
threeyear
streak
remain
true
to
form
and
of
all
threeyear
streak
revers
you
look
at
those
number
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
impli
more
like
to
choke
thi
year
but
it
would
be
equal
valid
to
look
at
those
number
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
impli
more
like
to
be
clutch
thi
year
sinc
the
probabl
are
split
each
way
i
complet
accept
that
reason
again
what
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
individu
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
on
a
consist
basi
then
we
would
have
someth
use
and
we
would
also
have
a
posit
correl
but
for
everi
individu
that
exhibit
such
a
pattern
and
hold
true
there
is
anoth
who
exhibit
such
a
pattern
and
then
revers
