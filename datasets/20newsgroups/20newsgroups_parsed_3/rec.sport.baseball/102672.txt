stay
in
school
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
learn
what
i
know
that
million
dollar
is
a
lot
of
money
i
know
rickey
henderson
doesnt
have
a
career
out
of
basebal
i
know
if
he
didnt
have
basebal
he
wouldnt
be
make
near
the
money
he
is
now
and
michael
jackson
jack
nicholson
and
bill
cosbi
wouldnt
be
make
near
a
much
money
if
they
werent
entertain
so
what
your
point
i
just
dont
understand
how
some
athlet
who
onli
play
a
sport
for
a
live
for
million
of
dollar
say
he
is
not
be
paid
enough
if
nobodi
will
sign
him
for
hi
ask
price
he
will
be
the
one
hurt
the
a
will
still
win
without
him
will
they
you
cant
usual
take
away
one
of
the
team
best
player
and
still
expect
them
to
win
or
do
you
think
the
pirat
will
continu
to
win
without
barri
bond
remeb
mani
of
these
athlet
have
noth
if
not
for
their
athlet
abil
noth
they
are
get
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
work
citizen
and
they
are
complain
of
not
enough
pay
so
again
jack
nicholson
get
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
work
citizen
and
much
more
than
rickey
henderson
for
that
matter
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
them
make
million
my
problem
is
when
the
say
they
arent
be
paid
enough
when
they
alreadi
get
millionalso
their
number
get
wors
the
reason
the
latter
often
happen
is
that
mani
of
these
folk
start
make
the
real
big
salari
late
in
their
career
when
they
are
on
the
declin
there
are
except
of
cours
dave
parker
fell
apart
after
make
hi
first
million
becaus
he
put
most
of
that
million
