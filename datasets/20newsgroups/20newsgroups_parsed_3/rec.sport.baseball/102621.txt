re
young
catcher
in
articl
mark
singer
write
at
age
alomar
had
a
brilliant
rooki
year
true
he
wa
limit
by
injuri
in
hi
sophomor
season
but
hi
number
both
that
yaer
and
the
year
follow
were
quit
mediocr
thi
season
the
same
bill
jame
project
a
ba
of
op
of
the
same
bill
jame
whi
do
you
say
that
it
sound
like
your
suggest
bill
jame
had
someth
to
do
with
overhyp
the
kid
to
death
au
contrair
he
wa
fairli
critic
of
him
after
hi
roy
campaign
note
that
he
wasnt
allworld
a
a
catcher
or
a
hitter
he
call
him
basic
averag
when
everyon
el
in
the
medium
wa
predict
the
next
johnni
bench
or
roy
campanella
both
of
these
young
men
were
highli
tout
defens
catcher
expect
to
be
among
the
best
ever
in
basebal
the
report
i
read
indic
that
lopez
is
veri
ordinari
defens
which
report
are
those
the
dodger
option
are
parrish
and
hernandez
and
now
onli
carlo
piazza
is
a
long
a
he
continu
with
hi
veri
hot
bat
they
will
keep
him
in
the
lineup
becaus
they
need
the
offens
product
when
he
cool
off
look
for
the
much
better
defens
catcher
hernandez
onli
to
play
more
i
like
hernandez
a
lot
but
if
piazza
can
catch
the
ball
youv
got
ta
play
him
imho
he
a
much
better
hitter
although
hernandez
isnt
a
bad
hitter
right
now
it
sound
like
piazza
will
catch
most
of
the
time
and
hernandez
will
be
candiotti
caddi
sinc
he
can
catch
the
knuckler
a
long
a
they
play
up
to
their
abil
the
dodger
could
have
a
veri
good
catch
tandem
the
brave
option
are
berryhil
and
olson
i
agre
that
olson
is
noth
special
but
i
do
think
berryhil
is
better
than
mani
peopl
on
rsb
believ
but
both
the
brave
catcher
are
veri
good
defens
call
a
game
block
the
plate
throw
and
although
they
are
somewhat
weak
offenivs
they
play
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
anoth
big
bat
i
think
both
are
overr
defens
see
nichol
law
of
catcher
defens
but
that
someth
that
difficult
to
prove
or
disprov
from
your
viewpoint
or
mine
about
the
onli
tangibl
thing
we
can
look
at
is
oppon
sb
and
that
cloud
by
how
well
your
pitcher
hold
runner
catcher
era
is
a
possibl
but
it
subject
to
way
too
mani
bias
a
for
them
play
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
anoth
big
bat
i
disagre
here
too
about
the
onli
chink
in
the
brave
armor
is
that
theyr
weak
offens
at
sever
posit
cf
c
b
s
if
belliard
play
b
unless
bream
and
hunter
form
anoth
superplatoon
and
veri
weak
defens
if
blauser
play
id
like
to
see
the
brave
give
at
least
one
of
mel
niev
javi
lopez
or
chipper
jone

shot
but
much
like
the
