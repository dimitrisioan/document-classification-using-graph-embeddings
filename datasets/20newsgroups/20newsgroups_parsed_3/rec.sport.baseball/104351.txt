write
keep
in
line
with
the
pessimist
on
the
net
ill
hold
off
on
the
astro
be
all
the
way
back
they
could
inde
contend
but
that
would
count
on
atlanta
encount
some
unforeseen
problem
such
a
injuri
or
keep
up
their
earli
season
abysm
hit
while
atlanta
ha
the
undisput
best
start
rotat
i
feel
that
their
relief
staff
may
be
suspect
they
dont
have
a
real
closer
although
mike
stanton
save
ha
been
use
in
that
role
didnt
stanton
start
off
great
last
year
and
then
falter
despit
thi
your
point
is
well
taken
atlanta
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
same
person
a
a
ny
team
thu
is
unlik
to
selfdestruct
for
houston
to
take
em
atlanta
need
to
suffer
some
injuri
particularli
to
their
start
rotat
astro
relief
corp
hold
togeth
if
doug
jone
keep
hi
changeup
effect
and
xavier
hernandez
can
be
effect
then
it
passabl
there
no
reason
lefthand
help
and
the
middl
relief
is
iffi
tom
eden
wa
expect
to
take
over
the
joe
boever
setup
man
role
but
he
been
injur
and
he
wa
an
expans
team
acquisit
anyway
houston
thought
that
boever
would
demand
too
much
money
so
they
let
him
go
doug
jone
can
lose
hi
touch
he
went
from
cleveland
allstar
closer
to
the
minor
in
a
pretti
short
span
from
what
i
understand
boever
and
murphi
were
consid
expend
by
the
club
houston
felt
that
their
posit
could
be
fill
by
a
number
of
player
art
doug
jone
is
the
key
to
houston
success
he
must
have
anoth
great
year
for
houston
to
challeng
in
the
nl
west
lousey
spring
closer
to
the
minor
in
a
pretti
short
span
right
a
strong
rotat
will
take
the
pressur
off
of
the
troubl
bullpen
bit
of
shaki
at
the
fifth
starter
slot
but
that
basic
normal
taubense
anthoni
gonzalez
and
cedeno
fulfil
some
hit
potenti
anthoni
appear
to
be
about
there
taubense
swing
look
a
lot
better
thi
year
solid
knock
against
expo
last
night
gonzalez
is
show
some
earli
power
and
cedeno
still
ha
the
loopiest
swing
thi
side
of
tim
wallach
the
unsuspect
strength
of
the
lower
part
of
the
order
ha
save
the
club
so
far
biggio
and

just
arent

note
are
you
at

concern
with
the

concern
next

uniform
there
is
talk
that
their
road
uniform
will
be
blech
tradit
grey
with
the
word
houston
written
across

chest
if
im
not

their
home
uniform
may
total
elimin
the
color
orang
shiver
mclane
favorit
color
is
red
so
im
realli
upset
the
current
unform
are
dull
and
the
new
one
sound
horribl
id
like
to
see
the
uniform
of
the
mid
return
they
may
not
have
been
pretti
but
houston
had
establish
a
long
precid
of
wear
the
ugliest
uniform
in
basebal
and
i
like
it
end
of
the
bargain
rememb
two
year
ago
a
littl
relief
go
a
long
way
then
they
could
win
