zanerescu
u
from
simmon
so
far
simmon
look
like
a
total
idiot
zane
smith
should
learn
how
to
switchpitch
and
return
from
the
dl
i
would
rather
have
zane
smith
pitch
right
hand
than
have
moeller
pitch
at
all
i
am
sure
simmon
wa
readi
to
say
i
told
you
so
after
otto
had
an
impress
win
last
week
now
otto
latest
debacl
ha
restor
simmon
reput
now
he
look
like
he
is
back
in
hi
form
when
he
had
the
al
highest
era
among
starter
four
our
sakenot
ted
sake
i
hope
he
pitch
with
a
era
for
the
rest
of
the
season
yeah
right
tomlin
and
merc
are
a
bit
disappoint
they
are
still
do
decent
but
consid
the
consider
amount
of
talent
and
matur
they
have
shown
their
first
season
they
seem
to
have
actual
gotten
a
littl
bit
wors
tomlin
wa
almost
unhitt
hi
rooki
year
against
lefti
batter
merc
had
a
veri
good
oba
hi
rooki
year
he
show
a
lot
of
concentr
at
the
plate
in
hi
rooki
year
walk
well
he
seem
to
be
on
the
lose
end
tonight
but
i
still
think
that
walk
desrv
hi
contract
leyland
should
accept
a
part
of
the
blame
for
the
lavallier
situat
i
cant
understand
hi
and
manag
fear
of
lose
tom
princ
through
waiver
even
if
they
do
what
the
use
he
is
aright
hander
like
slaught
not
a
veri
smart
platoon
also
i
am
blame
leyland
in
thi
case
sinc
he
is
hcurrent
convinc
that
lavallier
is
through
while
give
him
way
too
much
time
last
year
in
the
regular
season
and
the
playoffsslaught
should
have
play
in
all
game
he
ha
a
good
averag
against
right
hand
pitch
didnt
leyland
and
simmon
forse
thi
last
year
and
attempt
to
trade
lavallier
last
year
itself
ani
fool
could
tell
them
lavallier
wasnt
veri
fit
last
year
denni
moeller
is
scari
candeleria
well
he
is
not
go
to
have
such
a
high
era
at
the
end
of
the
season
mayb
it
will
be
in
rang
but
million
plu
come
on
other
than
the
customari
home
run
give
stage
patterson
goe
through
for
a
few
week
patterson
ha
serv
the
pirat
veri
well
each
year
so
far
he
seem
to
have
pitch
well
for
the
ranger
i
think
the
pirat
should
have
spent
the
money
on
patterson
in
stead
the
rooki
batter
well
young
ha
surpris
me
a
bit
with
hi
instant
impact
other
than
that
their
excel
perform
hasnt
been
too
much
of
a
surpris
i
think
we
should
thank
doughti
for
that
rooki
pitcher
wors
than
expect
especi
cook
slaught
how
come
he
wasnt
given
a
contract
extens
last
year
now
hi
valu
ha
increas
immens
lonni
smith
well
eric
davi
wa
sign
for
a
compar
amount
let
see
eric
can
hit
better
he
can
run
better
he
can
field
better
now
whi
didnt
the
pirat
go
after
eric
davi
an
injur
davi
is
better
than
a
healthi
lonni
smith
even
if
lonnni
smith
get
some
big
hit
thi
yearh
wont
be
an
asset
he
ha
look
terribl
on
the
base
and
in
the
field
manag
big
big
zero
sauer
ha
yet
to
make
a
forc
agreement
in
favor
of
revenu
share
he
seem
more
concern
about
plea
that
idiot
danforth
by
prepar
the
team
for
a
move
to
tampa
bay
alex
cole
fiasco
the
pirat
infield
and
cf
posit
look
good
the
rf
and
lf
would
have
look
good
if
we
could
have
gotten
cole
to
replac
two
of
the
four
outfield
eric
davi
van
slyke
and
cole
would
have
made
a
veri
respect
outfield
even
without
eric
davi
thye
pirat
would
have
a
respect
outfield
with
cole
svan
slyke
and
mercedi
think
he
should
hit
left
hand
against
left
in
stead
of
switch
hit
simmon
did
have
option
for
the
outfield
iron
the
biggest
accomplish
of
simmon
tenur
wa
get
alex
cole
realli
cheap
too
bad
compensatori
draft
pick
for

forget
it
the
pirat
can
rant
and
rave
they
will
not
get
those
pick
a
of
now
the
issu
is
still
be
appeal
now
if
thi
doesnt
convinc
anyon
that
simmon
and

will
on
a
final
note
tim
wakefield
wont
be
a
aw
a
he
wa
in
hi
last
start
but
dont
count
on
him
pitch
like
last
year
for
the
rest
of
the
season
also
if
the
pirat
are
in
content
toward
rthe

they
