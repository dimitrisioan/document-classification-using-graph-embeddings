if
doug
jone
keep
hi
changeup
effect
and
xavier
hernandez
can
be
effect
then
it
passabl
there
no
reason
lefthand
help
and
the
middl
relief
is
iffi
tom
eden
wa
expect
to
take
over
the
joe
boever
setup
man
role
but
he
been
injur
and
he
wa
an
expans
team
acquisit
anyway
houston
thought
that
boever
would
demand
too
much
money
so
they
let
him
go
doug
jone
can
lose
hi
touch
he
went
from
cleveland
allstar
closer
to
the
minor
in
a
pretti
short
span
from
what
i
understand
boever
and
murphi
were
consid
expend
by
the
club
houston
felt
that
their
posit
could
be
fill
by
a
number
of
player
art
doug
jone
is
the
key
to
houston
success
he
must
have
anoth
great
year
for
houston
to
challeng
in
the
nl
west
no
argument
at
all
with
murphi
he
scare
the
hell
out
of
me
when
he
came
in
last
year
on
the
other
hand
the
club
though
enough
of
boever
to
put
him
into
an
aw
lot
of
game
he
may
have
led
the
leagu
in
appear
he
did
at
least
at
some
point
he
seem
to
be
a
veri
viabl
setup
guy
but
i
guess
that
not
consid
that
crucial
by
the
club
i
can
just
rememb
two
year
ago
so
well
though
the
unsuspect
strength
of
the
lower
part
of
the
order
ha
save
the
club
so
far
biggio
and
finley
just
arent
do
their
job
of
get
on
base
instead
of
fill
hi
role
a
an
rbi
man
bagwel
ha
had
to
assum
biggio
and
finley
job
biggio
concern
me
sinc
he
usual
start
the
season
veri
strong
im
not
that
concern
those
guy
have
been
rel
consist
over
the
year
and
they
have
no
good
reason
to
declin
no
injuri
not
old
i
expect
them
to
come
through
just
fine
it
those
guy
that
have
not
been
consist
good
that
are
the
worrisom
part
even
if
they
are
come
through
right
now
on
a
side
note
are
you
at
all
concern
with
the
rumor
concern
next
year
uniform
there
is
talk
that
their
road
uniform
will
be
blech
tradit
grey
with
the
word
houston
written
across
the
chest
if
im
not
mistaken
their
home
uniform
may
total
elimin
the
color
orang
shiver
mclane
favorit
color
is
red
so
thi
sound
like
their
old
road
uni
pretti
dull
button
or
pullov
ill
check
through
my
uniform
book
to
see
if
theyv
alway
had
some
orang
im
realli
upset
the
current
unform
are
dull
and
the
new
one
sound
horribl
id
like
to
see
the
uniform
of
the
mid
return
they
may
not
have
been
pretti
but
houston
had
establish
a
long
precid
of
wear
the
ugliest
uniform
in
basebal
and
i
like
it
well
well
see
ive
got
a
astro
pullov
shirt
with
the
astro
stripe
across
the
shoulder
and
i
have
troubl
make
myself
wear
it
in
public
i
can
see
whi
they
might
want
that
to
chang
gee
if
they
elimin
the
orang
will
they
reupholst
the
seat
in
the
astro
stripe
section
what
use
to
be
the
gold
and
yellow
level
i
dont
know
those
number
they
use
now
i
saw
a
pinstrip
version
of
an
astro
cap
and
i
actual
thought
it
look
good
