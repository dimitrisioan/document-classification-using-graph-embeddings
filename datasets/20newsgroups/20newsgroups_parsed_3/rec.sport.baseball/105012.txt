of
late
it
wa
interest
to
see

maddux
so
well
im
not
sure
if

after
reveng
against
the

veri
pretti
hit
b
b
hr
for
rbi
the
giant
alway
hit
maddux
well
but
it
wa
interest
that
maddux
did
not
pitch
around
bond
to
get
to
clayton
last
night
he
threw
straight
fastbal
over
the
plate
to
bond
in
the
st
last
night
got
away
with
the
first
one
but
bond
hit
the
second
one
out
of
the
park
then
in
the
rd
when
clark
wa
at
third
base
with
one
out
maddux
did
not
intent
walk
bond
and
bond
drop
a
singl
to
leftcent
the
giant
a
a
team
are
do
a
lot
of
surpris
thing
thi
year
in
addit
to
bond
there
ha
been
some
good
pitch
and
some
hitter
seem
to
be
swing
much
better
clayton
defens
ha
been
superb
mcgee
seem
to
like
lead
off
thi
year
manwar
is
drive
the
ball
so
on
so
forth
the
brave
announc
point
out
that
mcgee
a
a
leadoff
hitter
ha
not
score
a
run
yet
he
will
alway
hit
around
but
im
concern
about
hi
onbas
percentag
the
key
in
the
lineup
is
matt
william
he
ha
to
stay
hot
so
that
bond
can
hit
with
runner
on
base
i
hope
it
continuesi
think
they
need
to
continu
well
into
june
befor
peopl
are
realli
sold
that
they
are
for
realparticularli
the
pitch
the
pitch
get
a
set
back
a
bud
black
is
place
on
the
dl
burba
ha
done
a
superb
job
fill
in
so
far
he
look
like
a
differ
pitcher
from
last
year
howev
swift
is
terribl
in
both
of
hi
start
with
burba
move
into
the
rotat
mike
jackson
is
the
onli
righthand
reliev
asid
from
rod
beck
hell
get
a
lot
of
action
i
also
hope
that
dusti
can
manag
hi
bullpen
better
than
roger
craig
especi
on
beck
i
wa
concern
when
beck
wa
use
for
straight
day
earlier
thi
week
for
myself
i
think
the
fresh
start
of
magowanbakeretc
ha
realli
wipe
out
a
lot
of
neg
from
the
last
few
year
and
will
be
a
real
factor
in
help
them
significantli
improv
over
last
year
so
far
so
good
