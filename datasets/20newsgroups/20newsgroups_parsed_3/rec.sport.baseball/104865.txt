of

thi

ok
i
admit
to
take
a
quick
brow
through
the
major
leagu
handbook
but
onli
after
the
first
or
oh
and
there
the
alltim
lighthit
black
outfield
lou
brock
look
it
up
and
curt
flood
cesar
geronimo
brock
coleman
and
wilson
were
hotdog
basesteal
also
lonni
smith
that
seem
to
be
a
special
class
cf
like
petti
and
wilson
also
get
more
of
a
break
especi
if
they
actual
do
field
well
and
brock
wasnt
all
that
bad
a
hitter
either
not
until
the
end
there
when
he
spoil
hi
ifetim
ba
and
again
i
suspect
thatth
problem
is
lessen
over
time
but
if
you
look
at
the
histori
of
the
last
three
decad
there
seem
to
be
a
clear
racebas
pattern
by
which
util
player
and
platoon
player
and
lesser
talent
stay
in
the
ml
far
longer
if
they
