said
and
final
id
like
to
point
out
that
mani
high
obp
guy
draw
their
walk
more
becaus
pitcher
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
becaus
they
have
a
great
eye
im
not
sure
i
use
to
think
thi
wa
true
but
more
and
more
im
becom
convinc
that
it
the
other
way
around
among
player
with
the
physic
abil
to
hit
the
ball
real
hard
the
patient
one
are
the
one
who
get
the
chanc
to
do
it
a
lot
let
break
down
the
four
basic
categori
of
hitter
accord
to
whether
they
are
power
threat
and
whether
they
walk
a
lot

okay
i
think
we
all
agre
that
singl
hitter
should
take
a
strike
or
two
and
tri
to
get
on
base
ani
way
they
can
so
the
no
powerimpati
guy
have
no
excus
the
no
powerpati
guy
are
do
the
right
thing
now
the
impatientpow
guy
how
could
you
leav
out
the
big
cat
would
these
guy
have
a
better
slug
percentag
if
they
took
more
pitch
perhap
but
i
doubt
it
if
you
tell
joe
carter
to
go
up
there
and
take
a
few
pitch
he
will
draw
more
walk
but
he
also
wont
hit
a
mani
frozen
rope
into
the
bleacher
becaus
he
is
more
like
to
hold
back
on
a
pitch
that
he
use
to
drive
the
patientpow
guy
joe
morgan
had
a
small
strike
zone
and
rickey
henderson
ha
a
strike
zone
the
size
of
hitler
heart
so
they
get
their
walk
base
on
the
small
zone
look
at
the
other
guy
thoma
bond
mcgwire
ruth
and
william
wow
a
lot
of
pitcher
would
rather
nibbl
at
the
corner
and
mayb
walk
these
guy
that
to
throw
a
clear
strike
to
them
the
pitcher
would
do
better
in
my
opinion
by
just
come
after
them
with
a
good
fastbal
for
a
strike
on
the
first
pitch
but
pitcher
would
rather
nibbl
go
or
and
then
get
hurt
