you
say
that
alomar
wa
the
better
hitter
last
year
and
immedi
follow
that
up
with
number
show
that
baerga
had
a
better
year
the
onli
categori
that
i
see
which
show
an
advantag
for
alomar
is
obp
well
obp
is
the
most
import
offens
statist
and
by
a
big
margin
point
of
obp
is
worth
consider
more
than
point
of
slug
that
be
said
i
still
think
baerga
wa
veri
slightli
better
last
year
but
i
think
thi
is
a
close
to
a
wash
a
your
like
to
find
i
person
dont
care
much
for
alomar
defens
i
dont
think
he
nearli
a
good
a
peopl
make
him
out
to
be
and
he
cant
turn
the
dp
to
save
hi
life
he
come
across
the
bag
improperli
and
hi
releas
is
slow
consid
the
high
leverag
of
the
dp
thi
is
a
shortcom
i
cant
overlook
in
the
long
term
id
move
alomar
to
anoth
posit
if
the
jay
could
trade

hot
devon
white
for
someth
ill
be
alomar
could
be
a
hell
