where
pendelton

up
the
scoreless
tie
in
the
ninth
with
a
twoout
tworun
homer
to
right
to
win
it
it
wasnt

a
kid
cleanup
corp
compos
mainli
of
year
old
kid
who
would
love
noth
better
than
to
run
out
on
the
field
in
the
fifth
inning
when
the
guy
in
the
toro
smooth
the
infield
and
grab
the
trash
it
might
not
be
glamor
but
at
that
age
i
probabl

be
on
the
