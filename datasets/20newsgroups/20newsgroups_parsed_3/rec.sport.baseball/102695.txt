even
third
base
dave
magadan
v
buechellemagadan
ha
a
higher
obp
and
is
a
better
hitter
buechel
ha
more
power
and
is
better
defens
i
think
edg
to
florida
catcher
santiago

wilkinswilkin
is
ok
but
santiago
is
better
edg
to

i
give
maldonado
the
edg
howev
like

and
save
wilson
for
pinch

and
the
like

he

here
the

middl

even
the

have
some
decent
middleman

mcelroy
closer
a
healthi
harvey

a
big
edg
to
the
