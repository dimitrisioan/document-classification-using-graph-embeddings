an
era
of
in
hi
start
what
doe
luck
have
to
do
with
a
era
he
wa
lucki
to
get
win
last
year
but
he
had
an
era
of
with
a
team
that
score
a
lot
of
run
i
would
be
happi
if
he
could
still
pitch
with
an
era
of
but
he
seem
to
be
suffer
from
a
total
callaps
bad
pitcher
are
more
prone
to
thi
total
collaps
than
good
pitcher
they
are
closer
to
the
chasm
of
mediocr
the
smallest
push
and
they
complet
lose
their
grip
but
good
one
can
collaps
somewhat
then
come
back
the
next
year
burleigh
grime
went
from
win
and
an
era
of
or
so
in
to
and
an
era
around
in
he
pitch
well
for
sever
more
year
carlton
won
and
lost
the
year
after
hi
record
sourc
bill
jame
histor
basebal
abstract
and
let
not
forget
john
tudor
who
start
and
finish
in
he
had
a
pretti
bad
era
when
you
take
busch
stadium
into
account
at
the
start
of
the
season
he
gave
up
earli
run
in
hi
game
and
would
get
stronger
a
the
game
went
on
thu
give
up
few
run
in
the
last
go
he
stay
in
the
game
and
get
the
win
how
el
would
he
have
pitch
so
mani
inning
yup
he
use
to
dig
himself
a
hole
then
get
it
togeth
and
stick
in
until
the
run
support
eventu
came
through
thi
year
he
just
hasnt
gotten
it
togeth
if
i
recal
he
had
a
era
in
the
st
half
and
a
era
in
the
nd
half
of
last
year
hmmm
run
in
inning
suppos
he
start
more
game
and
wind
up
w
inning
pitch
if
he
allow
run
a
game
in
the
next
inning
hell
have
a
era
or
so
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
think
i
have
hi
total
right
thi
is
go
to
be
hard
to
come
back
from
jack
may
be
finish
it
is
time
to
retir
or
be
releas
if
he
doe
not
return
to
hi
form
from
last
year
hi
million
contract
is
an
aw
lot
to
eat
my
st
hunch
is
that
morri
is
veri
gutsi
and
that
he
may
be
pitch
through
an
injuri
and
not
tell
anyon
my
nd
guess
is
that
he
will
be
banish
to
the
bullpen
the
remaind
of
the
season
after
a
few
more
start
perhap
when
stewart
come
off
the
dl
or
will
danni
cox
who
went
or
scoreless
inning
against
the
tribe
today
start
for
morri
he
look
like
a
realli
good
one
gaston
is
scrambl
to
find
starter
id
imagin
luckili
the
jay
have
a
veri
good
offens
i
dont
think
they
would
dare
releas
him
befor
the
end
of
the
year
hell
just
be
replac
by
stewart
or
cox
doug
fowler
me
age
now
mommi
and
daddi
other
ever
wonder
if
after
casey
rel
have
to
give
lot
of
hug
love
miss
the
rd
strike
in
the
poem
support
caus
heaven
is
just
a
great
he
ran
to
first
and
made
it
big
hug
that
last
forev
and
ever
