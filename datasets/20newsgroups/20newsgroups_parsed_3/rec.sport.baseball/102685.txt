that
veri
veri
few
player
at
thi
age
make
much
of
an
impact
in
the
big
especi
when
they
havent
even
play
aaa
ball
ye
but
thi
is
irrelev
your
talk
about
averag
when
we
have
lot
of
inform
about
thi
player
in
particular
to
base
our
decis
on
do
you

that
much
inform
on
him
realli
whi
isnt
lopez
like
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjust
hi
stat
for
park
and
leagu
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolut
scale
than
olson
or
berryhil
did
by
a
lot
i
dont
know
you
tell
me
what
percentag
of
player
reach
or
exceed
their
mle
in
their
rooki
season
were
talk
about
you
know
a
for
rush
if
there
realli
is
a
qualit
differ
between
the
minor
and
the
major
that
requir
a
period
of
adjust
and
i
dont
believ
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
wast
lopez
year
old
good
season
than
hi
year
old
veri
good
season
or
hi
yearold
excel
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclim
the
more
of
hi
prime
you
get
to
use
if
that
were
your
purpos
mayb
offerman
spent
get
acclim
if
you
will
the
dodger
a
a
team
paid
a
big
price
that
season
perhap
they
will
reap
the
benefit
down
the
road
do
you
realli
think
they
would
have
done
what
they
did
if
they
were
compet
for
a
pennant
lopez
wa
hit
over
ab
when
he
wa
cut
from
spring
train
what
doe
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chanc
mayb
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
coupl
start
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
hi
worth
the
point
wa
not
that
ab
is
a
signific
sampl
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anyth
in
spring
train
to
caus
even
a
blockhead
manag
to
question
whether
hi
minor
leagu
number
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
get
warm
up
for
a
stathead
im
amaz
that
you
put
ani
credenc
in
spring
train
did
you
notic
who
he
got
those
hit
off
of
or
are
you
go
to
tell
me
that
it
doesnt
make
a
differ
the
kid
will
improv
play
at
aaa
just
like
keith
mitchel
did
wait
a
minut
i
miss
someth
here
first
forget
keith
mitchel
are
you
say
that
a
kid
who
move
from
aa
to
aaa
and
then
doe
not
improv
would
have
been
better
off
make
a
direct
leap
to
the
major
if
a
player
doe
well
at
aa
and
then
doe
not
improv
at
aaa
isnt
that
a
sign
that
mayb
he
doesnt
belong
in
the
big
now
keith
mitchel
a
i
recal
no
stat
book
handi
surpris
he
jump
from
aa
to
atlanta
in
he
did
so
well
that
he
wa
return
to
the
minor
where
he
didnt
do
veri
well
at
all
now
hi
career
is
in
jeopardi
so
how
doe
he
fit
in
with
your
point
good

one
step
away
from
be
trade
or
move
out
of
basebal
duh
that
wa
me
and
you
so
far
your
onli
counterpropos
is
that
they
realli
dont
understand
how
good

experi
or
some
combin
of
the
two
i
think
my
interpret

lot
certainli
you
