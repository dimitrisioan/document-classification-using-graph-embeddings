ha
jack
lost
a
bit
of
hi
edg
what
is
the
worst
start
jack
morri
ha
had
uh
jack
lost
hi
edg
about
year
ago
and
ha
had
onli
one
abov
averag
year
in
the
last
again
goe
to
prove
that
it
is
better
to
be
good
than
lucki
you
can
count
on
good
tomorrow
lucki
seem
to
be
prone
to
bad
start
and
a
bad
finish
last
year
ye
i
am
enjoy
everi
last
run
he
give
up
who
wa
it
who
said
morri
wa
a
better
sign
than
viola
hey
valentin
i
dont
see
boston
with
ani
world
seri
ring
on
their
finger
oooooo
cheap
shot
damn
morri
now
ha
three
and
probabl
the
hall
of
fame
in
hi
futur
who
care
he
had
two
of
them
befor
he
came
to
toronto
and
if
the
jay
had
sign
viola
instead
of
morri
it
would
have
been
frank
who
won
and
got
the
ring
and
he
would
be
on
hi
way
to
thi
year
too
therefor
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easili
made
the
best
sign
your
logic
is
curiou
and
spuriou
there
is
no
reason
to
believ
that
viola
wouldnt
have
won
a
mani
game
had
he
sign
with
toronto
when
you
compar
their
stupid
wl
record
be
sure
to
compar
their
team
offens
averag
too
now
look
at
anyth
like
the
morrisviola
sweepstak
a
year
later
is
basic
hindsight
but
there
were
plenti
of
reason
whi
it
should
have
been
appar
that
viola
wa
the
better
pitcher
base
on
previou
recent
year
and
also
base
on
age
frank
is
almost
year
younger
how
mani
knew
that
peopl
got
caught
up
in
the
world
seri
and
then
on
morri
win
last
year
win
are
the
stupidest
most
mislead
statist
in
basebal
far
wors
than
rbi
or
r
that
he
won
just
mean
that
the
jay
got
him
a
lot
of
run
the
onli
realli
valid
retort
to
valentin
is
werent
the
red
sox
tri
to
get
morri
too
oh
sure
they
said
viola
wa
their
first
choic
afterward
but
what
should
we
have
expect
they
would
say
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
thi
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the
divis
more
like
th
if
thi
is
true
it
wont
be
for
lack
of
contribut
by
viola
so
who
care
charl
