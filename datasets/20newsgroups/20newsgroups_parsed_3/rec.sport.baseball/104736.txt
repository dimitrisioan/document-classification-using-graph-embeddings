write
the
reason
i
bother
do
thi
dr
stuff
wa
to
see
if
i
could
determin
the
answer
to
the
ageold
question
is
jeff
blauser
more
valuabl
than
rafael
belliard
well
it
look
like
just
a
doug
trump
tim
beat
him
to
the
net
with
hi
defens
analys
so
tim
ha
gotten
in
ahead
of
me
the
way
i
wa
do
it
wa
a
littl
differ
be
me
of
cours
i
use
equival
averag
to
work
out
how
mani
run
a
player
wa
worth
and
i
calcul
both
rate
of
perform
field
equival
averag
and
total
perform
field
equival
run
but
i
compar
not
to
the
averag
player
but
the
replac
player
and
here
whi
becaus
the
posit
adjust
come
built
in
to
the
system
in
the
al
of
the
averag

b
we
may
quibbl
with
the
exact
number
but
the
order
look
substanti
right
in
the
equival
averag
i
have
alway
set
leagu
averag
to
i
had
decid
in
hit
that
the
replac
level
batter
ha
an
eqa
of
the
name
of
that
replac
level
hitter
often
a
not
is
billi
ripken
i
decid
to
let
the
replac
level
fielder
be
the
same
distanc
from
a
but
in
the
opposit
direct
a
i
have
set
it
up
that
make
for
an
eqa
of
ye
i
can
add
run
are
proport
to
eqa
squar
the
differ
between
squar
and
squar
equal
the
differ
to
squar
and
i
round
off
for
simplic
an
allreplac
field
team
would
have

kevin
bass
in

ugh
so
the
total
number
of
rar
for
a

is
the
sum
of
hi
bat
and
field
rar
i
can
rate
them
by

rar
or
