out
of
basebal
within
five
year
im
skeptic
of
the
first
becaus
i
dont
think
snow
is
that
good
a
player
and
he
is
on
a
lose
team
i
dont
have
a
histori
handi
but
i
dont
recal
that
the
preponder
of
roy
come
from
win
team
in
fact
i
think
team
perform
is
gener
irrelev
a
almost
alway
the
most
deserv
candid
win
am
i
wrong
and
he
is
not
necessarili
on
a
lose
team
while
the
angel

make
them
a
win
team
the
beastmast
im
skeptic
of
the
second
becaus
of
hi
back
mattingli
is
thi
year
and
how
mani
player
play
until
they
are
not
too
mani
and
most
of
them
didnt
have
chronic
back
problem
when
they
were
could
be
wrong
on
either
or
both
but
i
think
that
the
smart
way
to
bet
