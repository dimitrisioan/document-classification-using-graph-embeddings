i
think
that
everyth
el
be
equal
it
not
too
much
to
ask
that
if
a
weeknight
game
can
be
shorten
by
halfanhour
by
cut
out
warmup
pitch
dawdl
outsid
the
batter
box
commerci
timeout
and
that
sort
of
thing
im
not
ask
for
too
much
how
do
you
know
they
can
be
shorten
by
halfanhour
ha
anybodi
done
a
studi
to
determin
how
much
time
is
actual
wast
say
in
these
a
game
oh
probabl
m
nichol
ha
given
the
averag
game
time
and
averag
run
score
for
and
a
veri
nice
piec
of
inform
m
nichol
who
know
she
may
be
listen
and
not
have
me
in
her
kill
file
after
all
those
number
indic
somewher
in
the
neighborhood
of
halfarun
le
be
score
per
game
and
the
game
take
minut
longer
someth
is
be
done
now
that
wasnt
done
ten
year
ago
which
is
extend
the
game
by
minut
m
nichol
think
it
more
pitch
given
the
increas
special
of
pitcher
it
wouldnt
surpris
me
if
it
not
simpli
more
pitch
though
i
dont
think
it
unreason
to
think
that
someth
can
be
done
to
get
ten
of
those
minut
back
then
i
get
a
coupl
more
from
shorten
the
warmup
time
for
a
relief
pitcher
after
he
come
in
and
a
coupl
more
still
from
enforc
exist
rule
which
have
been
state
in
other
post
in
thi
thread
and
other
relat
one
the
problem
is
who
decid
whether
that
time
is
wast
you
dont
seem
to
think
it
is
at
all
right
now
i
think
it
is
although
i
have
heard
one
case
favor
give
the
reliev
all
the
warmup
he
think
he
need
the
differ
in
mound
between
the
field
and
pen
but
who
know
if
the
rule
get
chang
mayb
someth
i
didnt
forese
will
happen
to
chang
my
mind
but
you
can
bet
a
lot
of
mind
would
fail
to
forese
the
same
thing
or
el
noth
will
be
chang
rg
i
can
play
me
better
than
anyon
there
