not
field
to
save
hi
life
and
they
said
he
wa
brought
in
to
provid
defens
velard

are
better
defens
than
owen
rememb
it
still
earli
look
for
hi
offens
to
tail
off
and
hi
defens
to
improv
hope
he
ha
that
rep
becaus
i
heard
that
either
last
year
or
over
the
last
year
or
someth
like
that
he
ha
the
third

do
agre
though
that
he

all
that
impress
in
the
field
thu
far
owen
onli
ha
one
error
so
far
i
believ
that
serious
underrepres
the
harm
he
ha
done
in
the
field
owen
will
cleanli
play
ani
ball
he
reach
he
will
have
a
fine
field
percentag
like
alway
the
problem
is
that
he
doesnt
reach
anyth
that
isnt
hit
straight
at
him
thi
wouldnt
be
quit
a
obviou
a
problem
if
he
were
play
next
to
kelli
gruber
or
robin
ventura
but
the
third
baseman
for
the
yanke
is
wade
