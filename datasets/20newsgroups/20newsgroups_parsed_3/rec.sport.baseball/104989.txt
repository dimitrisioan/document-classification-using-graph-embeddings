wa
re
jack
morri
note
im
not
post
thi
a
part
of
an
argument
with
roger
meynard
but
a
an
independ
sort
of
thread
i
do
actual
quot
some
thing
that
roger
meynard
wrote
but
it
might
be
better
to
think
of
thi
a
sampl
hi
post
in
the
hiphop
sen
becaus
it
fit
in
with
what
i
want
to
say
roger
maynard
write
but
the
point
is
that
the
onli
decis
make
pro
ce
use
to
determin
the
best
is
the
score
of
the
game
and
it
re
late
to
the
team
not
the
individu
player
there
is
no
method
inher
in
basebal
of
compar
individu
perform
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
becaus
after
all
basebal
is
a
team
game
there
an
interest
parallel
between
thi
way
of
view
a
basebal
team
and
some
peopl
concept
of
a
biolog
organ
in
the
biolog
context
we
would
veri
like
read
fit
for
the
score
of
the
game
and
organ
for
team
how
we
interpret
player
is
trickier
but
either
organ
or
gene
might
seem
reason
choic
depend
on
what
point
we
were
tri
to
make
a
gene
interpret
actual
might
be
realli
interest
in
thi
case
but
that
would
be
a
differ
and
probabl
longer
post
if
howev
we
take
the
organ
view
then
our
knowledg
of
biolog
should
make
u
paus
befor
we
start
say
thing
like
speci
x
is
more
fit
than
speci
y
becaus
of
a
better
organ
z
given
what
we
know
about
the
interdepend
of
organ
we
would
often
be
suspici
of
such
claim
but
note
that
thi
type
of
argument
is
quit
often
made
when
you
map
speci
x
onto
human
and
organ
z
onto
brain
on
the
other
hand
some
statement
of
thi
kind
do
seem
more
reason
than
other
a
far
a
we
can
test
them
eg
brain
abov
might
be
more
reason
than
pancrea
assum
no
gross
patholog
particularli
if
speci
y
is
a
primat
even
when
you
make
such
statement
you
should
be
concern
with
the
function
of
the
whole
organ
and
the
possibl
that
one
organ
might
be
more
crucial
for
one
speci
and
a
second
organ
in
anoth
not
to
mention
the
possibl
that
no
organ
is
particularli
crucial
in
some
third
speci
howev
if
we
are
nonvitalist
with
ani
kind
of
reductionsit
streak
we
will
want
to
say
that
an
organ
is
not
some
complet
magic
unanalyz
whole
but
an
intrigu
process
made
up
of
variou
subprocess
that
interact
in
way
that
are
potenti
observ
some
of
these
process
might
be
local
to
particular
organ
while
other
may
be
distribut
across
multipl
organ
in
a
way
thi
is
just
like
a
basebal
team
except
that
i
think
it
is
pretti
clear
that
the
process
and
interact
involv
in
basebal
are
much
simpler
and
le
numer
than
in
most
organ
to
say
that
one
player
is
better
than
anoth
is
to
be
abl
to
say
ab
solut
that
player
a
team
would
have
play
better
with
player
b
in
their
lineup
sheer
specul
imposs
to
ascertain
one
thing
that
is
quit
difficult
about
basebal
is
that
perfectli
control
experi
are
sometim
veri
tough
to
do
but
of
cours
thi
ha
never
stop
research
from
do
the
best
they
can
and
sometim
deriv
veri
power
conclus
even
in
the
absenc
of
certainti
most
of
thi
goe
far
beyond
sheer
specul
but
even
sheer
specul
can
motiv
further
interest
research
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statist
and
claim
that
clemen
ha
done
better
than
anoth
pitcher
with
those
statist
a
a
criterion
then
fine
in
thi
case
were
see
the
word
statist
mean
summari
of
observ
event
where
the
event
themselv
can
be
view
a
the
output
of
some
process
and
possibl
input
for
other
process
thu
if
we
have
ani
valid
notion
of
how
the
process
are
put
togeth
into
the
function
organ
data
in
the
form
of
statist
might
give
u
a
basi
to
test
particular
hypothes
but
you
have
to
be
abl
to
prove
that
those
statist
measur
the
individu
contribut
to
win
the
w
becaus
that
is
the
onli
measur
of
best
that
ha
ani
mean
in
the
context
of
basebal
thi
statement
bring
u
back
to
the
concept
of
fit
again
fit
is
defin
in
term
of
both
an
organ
and
it
environ
you
might
be
fit
in
one
situat
and
not
anoth
move
to
basebal
it
is
clear
that
each
team
spend
the
entir
season
in
an
environ
includ
all
the
other
team
in
the
leagu
in
at
least
a
nomin
sen
the
divis
winner
are
the
fittest
team
in
the
leagu
in
that
they
on
averag
had
better
fit
score
than
ani
of
their
compet
opponennt
but
in
a
real
sen
there
is
a
fairli
larg
random
compon
in
the
perform
of
each
team
that
is
difficult
if
not
imposs
to
account
for
in
term
of
factor
intrins
to
or
interest
for
basebal
the
same
is
true
in
biolog
but
here
is
also
no
direct
biolog
equival
of
the
world
seri
in
baseb
in
the
world
seri
the
random
compon
may
be
greatli
magnifi
by
the
small
number
of

that
are

both

suddenli
experi
huge
chang
from
the
environ
where
they
were
origin
success
it
might
be
fun
to
watch
but
it
unclear
what
it
all
realli
mean
now
just
one
more
unrel
point
i
have
yet
to
see
that
ani
of
you
can
predict
a
w
winner
with
ani
greater
accuraci
than
jeann
dixon
on
the
other
hand
you
have
seen
some
of
u
who
can
predict
the
outcom
of
the
division
race
better
than
a
random
assign
of
team
to
finish
and
mayb
some
of
u
eg
me
who
can
do
thi
better
than
the
other
particip
in
thi
forum
on
a
regular
basi
but
thi
is
probabl
onli
due
to
the
fact
that
a
game
schedul
give
you
a
littl
hope
that
bad
hop
arent
the
onli
differ
between
the
winner
and
the
loser
moreov
youv
had
the
opportun
to
see
some
analysi
of
the
world
seri
situat
that
make
the
strong
claim
that
nobodi
can
predict
the
w
winner
with
reliabl
greater
accuraci
than
a
coin
bias
onli
to
reflect
the
