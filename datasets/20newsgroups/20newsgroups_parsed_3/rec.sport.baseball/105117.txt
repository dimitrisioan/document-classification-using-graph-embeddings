re
yanke
thought
velard
etc
in
articl
keith
keller
write
real
long
but
good
post
on
yanke
trade
omit
i
disagre
on
one
point
velard
ye
mayb
the
yank
should
have
let
him
develop
but
he
rode
the
columbu
shuttl
way
too
mani
time
to
do
so
probabl
the
fault
of
georg
but
no
matter
now
hi
use
is
done
he
will
not
be
abl
to
develop
into
a
good
player
thi
deep
in
hi
career
at
least
i
dont
think
so
hi
field
is
horrend
at
rd
mayb
hed
be
good
at
short
he
cant
hi
the
curv
at
all
and
i
think
all
hi
trip
from
new
york
to
columbu
and
back
have
demor
him
to
the
point
that
he
just
doesnt
care
get
rid
of
him
i
sayth
sooner
the
better
for
both
the
yank
and
velard
keith
keller
let
go
ranger
velard
hasnt
been
to
columbu
if
i
recal
for
about
three
year
grant
he
hasnt
been
a
full
time
player
but
when
he
doe
play
ive
alway
thought
he
had
a
good
bat
he
might
be
demor
about
not
play
full
time
but
he
hasnt
been
shuttl
around
i
think
he
been
in
new
york
ever
sinc
he
had
hit
in
ab
back
in
or
i
believ
i
dont
think
he
is
gold
glove
calibr
but
he
doesnt
boot
it
around
either
i
think
if
velard
is
given
a
chanc
he
could
becom
extrem
product
i
dont
have
ani
stat
to
back
thi
up
and
i
dont
know
if
hi
defens
would
cost
ani
game
but
i
think
he
could
help
and
he
ha
thi
year
he
ha
hr
alreadi
same
goe
for
jim
leyrtiz
he
ha
a
big
mouth
but
he
doe
get
the
job
done
when
he
concentr
i
think
the
situat
with
leyritz
is
that
he
believ
he
is
a
potenti
superstar
and
he
get
piss
about
not
play
i
think
he
might
have
realiz
someth
when
the
marlin
or
rocki
didnt
select
him
the
yank
need
to
worri
about
the
bullpen
right
now
kamieniecki
and
wickmanmilitello
in
the
bullpen
ouch
im
pray
that
the
bp
will
return
to
last
year
form
chri
what
im
listen
to
anyth
that
guitar
god
go
yanke
dann
huff
