you

i
say
you
are
out

that
is
almost
imposs
for
a

bat
behind

who
kill

up

i

rbi
is
not

much
of

sometim
u
stathead
get
lucki
grace
didnt
hit
behind
dawson
the
entir

but
he
also
finish
with
onli
rbi
from
tue
may
the
most
ballsi
predict
ever
mark
mcgwire
will
hit
or
more
hr
thi
year
nope
he
slow
down
and
the
injuri
finish
him
off
didnt
even
reach
but
a
ballsi
predict
nonetheless
from
thu
may
baltimor
will
not
fade
they
will
not
win
the
divis
thi
year
but
they
will
finish
within
five
game
i
find
the
prospect
of
two
oriol
win
each
easier
to
comprehend
than
that
of
two
sox
no
offens
i
think
their
pitch
is
about
a
good
a
the
divis
ha
to
offer
the
oriol
finish
seven
game
out
none
of
them
won
though
mussina
might
have
had
a
chanc
with
better
relief
and
more
start
nobodi
els
in
the
divis
is
worth
a
darn
they
all
finish
a
minimum
of
fifteen
game
out
the
tribe
that
anoth
reason
to
watch
baltimor
thi
year
and
next
they
wont
wast
mani
of
those
game
against
the
rest
of
the
divis
except
for
the
brewer
who
you
probabl
forgot
you
were
right
the
rest
of
the
divis
wa
thoroughli
mediocr
the
yanke
and
indian
led
with
win
the
red
sox
trail
with
win
none
were
horribl
but
four
were
five
or
more
game
below
from
david
johnson
date
thu
aug
gmt
right
that
wa
me
i
never
said
the
jay
were
a
cinch
to
clinch
it
but
i
said
that
milwauke
will
be
more
of
a
threat
than
baltimor
i
do
think
that
toronto
should
win
it
but
after
i
dont
consid
anyth
a
cinch
unless
you
have
someth
like
a
game
lead
with
game
to
go
i
do
think
that
the
jay
have
the
best
talent
team
in
the
al
east
and
if
we
had
a
good
or
even
averag
manag
we
might
have
a
bigger
lead
right
now
i
also
think
that
the
oriol
will
not
play
much
better
than
basebal
for
the
rest
of
the
season
you
win
from
thu
nov
in
articl
you
write
indian
the
first
and
onli
season
ever
predict
the
cleveland
indian
will
win
or
more
game
next
year
you
were
right
from
fri
sep
jose
rijo
will
win
the
cy
young
award
if
he
is
healthi
enough
to
go
at
least
ip
who
would
have
thought
he
would
tri
to
steal
a
base
whi
risk
such
an
injuri
he
had
ip
but
didnt
win
the
cy
young
maddux
surpris
all
the
oriol
will
win
game
in
at
least
of
the
next
year
probabl
the
last
and
their
pitch
staff
will
have
a
team
era
among
the
best
in
the
al
in
at
least
of
the
next
year
but
not
necessarili
all
the
same
year
a
they
win
thi
one
will
take
a
long
time
to
verifi
i
dont
think
i
want
to
wait
that
long
but
they
won
game
last
year
and
they
were
fifth
in
the
leagu
in
era
not
a
bad
start
ben
mcdonald
will
not
challeng
for
an
era
titl
in
the
next
year
nor
will
he
have
victori
either
year
by
challeng
i
mean
finish
among
the
leader
be
among
the
leader
befor
the
season
is
done
doesnt
count
he
will
probabl
never
be
the
pitcher
he
wa
hype
to
be
but
is
still
a
decent
starter
to
have
look
like
it
he
wasnt
bad
last
year
just
too
consist
to
be
an
ace
so
far
thi
year
look
like
more
of
the
same
the
philli
will
give
up
mani
fewer
walk
ifwhen
they
get
rid
of
their
bullpen
coach
ryan
i
am
not
predict
when
or
whether
they
will
get
rid
of
him
and
you
will
have
to
give
the
team
a
littl
bit
of
time
to
adjust
befor
see
the
radic
chang
they
would
have
a
fine
pitch
staff
if
they
would
just
steal
ray
miller
away
from
pittsburg
the
white
sox
seem
to
have
the
same
problem
but
not
a
bad
i
honestli
cant
say
did
they
get
rid
of
him
their
bb
total
were
down
last
year
ricki
jordan
will
have
rbi
if
he
start
game
hit
in
the
or
or
spot
in
ani
lineup
or
the
spot
in
a
lineup
with
veri
good
obp
in
the
hitter
thi
appli
for
each
of
the
next
year
i
just
dont
think
he
that
good
billi
ripken
will
never
again
hit
over
with
ab
so
far
so
good
im
definit
not
wait
to
check
thi
one
from
fri
sep
no
matter
what
lou
gorman
and
hi
scout
say
paul
quantril
will
never
ever
be
an
adequ
major
leagu
starter
never
i
have
never
seen
a
start
pitcher
who
can
onli
strike
out
per
inning
at
aaa
be
success
in
the
major
current
plan
seem
to
be
to
use
quantril
in
long
relief
he
ha
a
rubber
arm
and
unusu

he
might
be

itd
be

who
had

one
full

if

is
go
to

how

he

despit
a

from

the
expans

look

dave

for
anoth

with
expans
never

shawn
hare

jodi
hurst
will

they
are

in

minor

i
dont

they
are
in

ron

will
be
a
minor
leagu
manag
with
the
yanke
dunno
what
happen
to
him
it
will
be
byeby
for
balboni
if
he
still
around
he
stuck
in
the
minor
bo
jackson
will
not
be
a

hm
with

out
bo
look

get
a

gari
huckabi
will
have
