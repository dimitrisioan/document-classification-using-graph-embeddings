ha
to
be
the
worst
manag
in
basebal
for
anyon
who
didnt
see
sunday
game
with
a
right
hander
pitch
he
decid
to
bench
lankform
a
left
hand
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
hander
that
becaus
lankford
had
a
minor
injuri
from
a
coupl
of
game
befor
that
and
wa
daytoday
onli
avail
a
a
pinchrunn
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
base
load
and
two
out
he
put
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
a
a
pinch
runner
and
us
lui
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
a
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
think
see
abov
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquir
mark
whiten
he
comment
how
fortun
the
cardin
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
thi
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torr
said
he
like
gilkey
come
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
doe
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
start
on
most
everi
team
in
the
leagu
at
the
begin
of
the
interview
torr
also
said
lankford
is
the
one
outfield
guy
who
in
there
no
matter
what
my
guess
is
jordan
will
eventu
end
up
be
odd
man
out
due
to
low
on
base
percentag
whiten
wa
a
great
acquisit
decent
offens
and
great
defens
in
rightfield
but
dont
worri
gilkey
will
be
start
a
soon
a
jordan
or
whiten
display
an
extend
period
of
low
offens
output
