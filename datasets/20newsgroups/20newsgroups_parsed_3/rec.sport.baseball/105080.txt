my
supposit
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
player
consist
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
abl
to
make
some
reason
conclus
about
those
player
a
oppos
to
all
basebal
player
thi
may
be
the
root
of
the
confus
plea
consid
the
follow
hypothet
with
an
open
mind
note
that
i
am
not
yet
say
that
it
ha
anyth
to
do
with
the
question
at
hand
suppos
we
have
a

you
have
struck
right
at
the
heart
of
our
disagr
to
rebut
my
opinion
you
have
made
an
analog
with
a
game
of
chanc
your
hypothesi
assum
that
the
lotto
player
have
no
impact
on
the
select
of
the
number
and
henc
their
abil
to
win
well
that
certainli
true
in
lotto
but
it
ha
absolut
noth
to
do
with
the
sport
of
basebal
when
you
start
down
the
wrong
path
you
finish
down
the
wrong
path
i
repeat
i
do
not
think
that
statist
analysi
of
prior
clutch
hit
perform
is
an
accur
predictor
of
futur
clutch
hit
perform
i
do
howev
think
that
analysi
of
prior
clutch
hit
perform
may
for
some
player
indic
a
defici
in
their
game
that
inde
will
provid
a
basi
for
project
their
particular
futur
perform
and
i
think
chri
sabo
is
such
