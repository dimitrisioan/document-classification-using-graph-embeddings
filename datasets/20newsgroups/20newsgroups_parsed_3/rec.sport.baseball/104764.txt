i
agre
with
nick
what
the
big
deal
about
long
game
if
you
want
to
watch
basebal
there
that
much
more
basebal
to
watch
and
ye
basebal
includ
the
space
between
play
a
well
a
the
play
themselv
first
a
longer
game
in
no
way
suggest
more
basebal
to
watch
unless
you
includ
watch
the
grass
grow
a
basebal
the
lengthier
game
are
so
becaus
of
batter
step
out
of
the
box
pitcher
take
longer
between
pitch
and
excess
trip
to
the
mound
by
manag
and
pitch
coach
until
six
or
seven
year

i
wa
an
enthusiast
fan
of
nfl
footbal
last
year
i
hardli
watch
a
game
what
turn
me
off
were
the
incess
interrupt
to
the
continu
of
the
game
a
team
score
minut
of
commerci
kickoff
minut
of
commerci
three
down
and
a
punt
minut
of
commerci
aaaaarrrrgh
earlier
in
thi
thread
i
comment
on
larussa
and
the
a
whom
i
believ
institution
slow
play
i
dont
mind
the
catandmous
game
with
rickey
on
first
in
fact
i
rather
enjoy
it
similarli
i
would
enjoy
the
battl
with
listach
or
lofton
or
polonia
on
first
what
i
object
to
is
when
such
game
are
play
with
karkovic
on
first
or
when
the
game
is
a
blowout
i
dont
mind
when
the
pitcher
step
off
the
mound
to
gather
hi
thought
in
a
crucial
situat
or
when
a
hitter
step
out
of
the
box
to
regain
hi
concentr
what
i
object
to
is
when
hitter
and
pitcher
take
such
break
at
everi
opportun
when
a
game
is
excit
these
littl
delay
serv
a
tension
builder
and
for
me
enhanc
the
valu
of
the
experi
of
the
game
when
the
delay
happen
with
regular
they
becom
nuisanc
just
like
the
commerci
break
in
footbal
i
understand
the
nfl
impos
a
number
of
rule
chang
to
speed
up
the
game
basic
put
an
onu
on
the
offici
staff
to
move
the
marker
and
the
ball
to
the
spot
faster
that
did
not
address
the
problem
of
the
continu
of
the
game
it
may
have
appeas
the
sponsor
and
the
network
but
i
would
be
amaz
if
it
did
anyth
to
enhanc
the
experi
of
the
fan
similari
while
some
hour
basebal
game
bore
me
to
tear
those
are
the
one
where
there
is
no
continu
and
the
player
are
take
exasperatingli
long
period
to
get
readi
for
each
pitch
i
doubt
if
anyon
watch
the
bravesgi
game
care
about
gant
step
out
i
doubt
if
anyon
watch
that
game
would
have
found
that
paus
to
be
anyth
but
an
opportun
to
have
their
complet
attent
claim
by
the
drama
that
wa
present
i
would
be
total
oppos
to
ani
effort
that
would
elimin
that
aspect
of
basebal
on
the
other
hand
i
wish
basebal
had
a
commission
that
wa
power
enough
to
sit
down
with
aldersonlarussaduncan
and
explain
that
they
are
actual
hurt
the
product
of
basebal
by
drag
their
game
out
the
way
that
they
do
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
a
littl
armtwist
there
