switch
your
hand
to
the
guardrail
to
stretch
your
shoulder
but
be
sure
and
squeez
your
thigh
while
your
do
it
so
your
rider
know
your
still
there
the
guard
rail
isnt
a
safe
a
hold
onto
your
rider
hmmmm

doe
everyon
on
that
side
of
the
pond
seem
to
want
pillion
to
hang
on
to
the
rider
rather
than
the
grabrail
becaus
