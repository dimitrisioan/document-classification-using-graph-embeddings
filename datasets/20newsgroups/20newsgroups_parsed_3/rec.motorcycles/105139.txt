i
dart
my
eye
to
my
mirror
and
realiz
it
the
moroon
fli
up
right
behind
me
in
my
panic
i
pop
my
clutch
and
stall
the
bike
luckili
the
guy
stop
a
foot
behind
my
rear
wheel
i
understand
whi
you
theoret
stop
so
far
behind
a
car
but
can
you
realli
in
actual
avoid
such
an
incid
suggest
the
experi
you
describ
is
whi
i
dont
like
to
sit
with
my
bike
in
gear
i
figur
there
a
chanc
that
ill
be
startl
in
some
way
and
stall
my
bike
and
i
figur
thi
is
more
like
than
the
chanc
that
ill
be
unabl
to
escap
some
situat
becaus
of
the
extra
time
need
to
put
the
bike
in
gear
so
i
concentr
on
avoid
situat
rather
than
make
splitsecond
evas
manuv
i
split
lane
so
im
not
at
the
end
of
the
line
unfortun
thi
is
not
legal
in
most
of
the
countri
if
i
cant
split
perhap
there
isnt
room
then
i
will
stop
near
one
side
of
the
lane
so
i
have
an
easi
escap
and
leav
my
bike
in
gear
until
the
next
car
ha
stop
i
watch
in
my
mirror
in
the
mean
time
to
make
sure
it
will
whether
i
realli
would
have
time
to
move
should
a
car
fail
to
stop
i
havent
had
to
find
out
yet
some
car
have
an
annoy
habbit
of
race
up
behind
you
befor
brake
heavilli
so
it
can
be
hard
to
tell
if
they
are
plan
to
brake
or
not
so
in
summari
posit
yourself
for
an
easi
exit
and
then
watch
your
mirror
until
it
all
