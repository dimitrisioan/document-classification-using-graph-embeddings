ive
found
that
an
effect

is
to
flash
my
brake
light
by
pump
the
pedal
you
will
obvious
need
a
bit
of
free
play
in
your
brake
pedal
to
do
thi
it
seem
that
even
the
most

dead
idiot
can
usual
discern
that
a
flash
red
light
directli
in

think
it
kinda
like
wave
a
red

at
a

all
in

if
you
cant
move

let
