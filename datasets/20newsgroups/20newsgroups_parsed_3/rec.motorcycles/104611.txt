which
dictat
how
quickli
you
can

and
not
the
knowledg

are
you

enabl
you
to
corner
faster
or
more

you
could
manag

will
put

it
the
one
who
know
what
he
do
and
whi
that
will
be
faster
it
may
be
possibl
to
improv
your
techniqu
if
you
have
no
idea
what
it
is
through
trial
and
error

onli
by

can

that
all

to

to
know

or
that

or
better
a
a

is
absurd
do
you
consid
an
understand
of
the

absurd
are
you
serious
suggest
that

can
form
a

manag
polici
without

but
by

in

we
are
confus
peopl
unnecessarili
right
at

when
there
are
far
more

to
learn
i
disagre
the
exist

success
of

which
teach

that

that
is
neither

of

and
that
wa
my
origin

perhap
but
in
the
ensu

you
stray
far
from

point
to
claim
that
