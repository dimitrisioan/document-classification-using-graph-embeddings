i
wa
a
littl
hasti
in
articl
andrew
infant
write
also
nc
recent
last
few
year
decid
that
due
to
the
fact
there
are
constantli
peopl
on
the
road
drunk
drive
they
will
rais
their
awar
of
it
by
make
stricter
law
and
a
such
now
i
believ
nc
ha
the
toughest
law
for
dwi
while
not
necessarili
increas
ani
amount
of
awar
or
kill
on
the
highway
mean
it
onli
made
a
differ
at
sentenc
automat
revoc
of
your
licens
for
a
year
im
not
sure
it
the
toughtest
law
around
but
nc
ha
absolut
no
sens
of
humor
with
respect
to
drive
law
anyway
i
think
they
put
you
in
jail
and
sell
your
first
child
into
slaveri
for
pass
a
school
bu
a
bill
breez
through
the
nc
hous
to
lower
the
intoxif
level
from
to
it
face
stiff
opposit
in
the
senat
recent
the
highway
patrol
took
a
few
of
the
opposit
senat
out
and
gave
them
some
shot
and
when
they
hit
put
them
on
a
cours
dodg
cone
they
fail
and
will
probabl
chang
their
vote
a
a
result
for
some
bizarr
reason
nc
is
the
onli
state
where
the
govern
ha
no
veto
power
over
legisl
come
out
of
the
state
congress
so

on
the
matter
is
moot
