at
psi
instead
anyon

the
reason
a
i
know
though
the
pressur
i
should
run
at
is
that
recommend
by
the
manufactur
of
the
new

i
purchas
the
real
question
i
have
is
thi
the
old
tire
that
are
on
the
bike
are
for
the
front
a
metzler
tour
special
h
and
for
the
rear
an
avon
roadrunn
h
h
a
mark
on
each
tire
both
are
larger
than
that
list
in
the
hayn
manual
what
doe
the
owner
manual
recommend
and
wa
it
common
to
go
up
one
size
for
thi
bike
also

variou
manufactur
inner
tube
qualiti
the
abov
size
are
inch
except
for
the
addit
mark
on
the
current
rear
tire
what
is
the
best
metric
match
the
local

thought
h
on

a
metzler
me
laser
possibl
comp
k
on
the
front

me
on
the

both
in
mb
varieti
if
possibl
the

system
i
alreadi
use
the
me
on
both
the
vision
and
fj
for

front
and
like
it
and
i
thought
that
with
the
shaft
drive
behavior
and
torqu
from
the
guzzi
that
the
me
might
give
more
predict
back
end
control
and

than
