write
that
would
be
low
drag
bar
and
way
rad
rearset
for
the
fj
so
that
the
ergonom
constraint
would
have
contracept
consequ
ouch
thi
bring
to
mind
one
of
the
recommend
in
the
hurt
studi
becaus
the
rear
of
the
ga
tank
is
in
close
proxim
to
highli
prize
and
easili
damag
anatomi
hurt
et
al
recommend
that
manufactur
build
the
tank
so
a
to
reduc
the
er
step
function
provid
when
the
rider
bodi
slide
off
of
the
seat
and
onto
the
ga
tank
in
the
unfortun
event
that
the
bike
stop
suddenli
and
the
rider
doesnt
i
think
it
realli
inspir
how
the
manufactur
have
taken
thi
advic
to
heart
in
their
design
of
bike
like
the
cbrrr
and
the
gtsa
i
dunno
on
my
old
gse
the
tankseat
junction
wa
nice
and
smooth
but
if
you
were
to
travel
all
the
way
forward
youd
collect
the
top
tripleclamp
in
a
sensit
area
id
hate
to
have
to
make
the
choic
but
i
think
id
prefer
the
