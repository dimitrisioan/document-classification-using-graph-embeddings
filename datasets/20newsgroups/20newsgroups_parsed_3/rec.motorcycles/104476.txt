mjssorri
bill
but
thi
is
complet
bollock
you
learn
how
to
counterst
mjsthe
first
time
you
rode
the
bike
it
natur
and
intuit
sorri
mike
im
not
go
to
kick
over
the
can
you
not
counterst
over
mph
stone
that
one
been
kick
around
enough
for
the
sake
of
argument
ill
conced
that
it
counterst
sake
of
argument
onli
mjsmsf
did
not
teach
you
how
to
counterst
it
onli
told
you
what
mjsyou
were
alreadi
do
and
there
no
valu
in
that
i
didnt
say
there
wa
no
valu
all
i
said
wa
that
it
is
veri
confus
to
newbi
there
a
big
differ
in
know
what
happen
and
how
to
make
it
do
it
especi
in
the
extrem
case
of
an
emerg
swerv
and
just
let
the
bike
do
whatev
it
doe
to
make
itself
turn
onc
i
knew
precis
what
wa
happen
and
how
to
make
it
do
it
abruptli
and
on
command
my
emerg
avoid
abil
improv
tenfold
not
to
mention
a
big
improv
in
my
normal
corner
abil
i
am
much
more
profici
know
how
to
counterst
the
motorcycl
rather
than
let
the
motorcycl
steer
itself
that
is
when
i
rememb
to
take
cognit
command
of
the
bike
rather
than
let
it
run
itself
through
the
corner
whereupon
i
return
to
my
origin
comment
better
to
learn
what
happen
right
from
the
start
and
how
to
take
charg
of
it
rather
than
develop
the
bad
habit
of
mere
go
along
for
the
ride
bill
you
are
kid
yourself
here
firstli
motorcycl
do
not
steer
themselv
onli
the
rider
can
do
that
secondli
it
is
the
adhes
of
the
tyre
on
the
road
the
suspens
geometri
and
the
ground
clearanc
of
the
motorcycl
which
dictat
how
quickli
you
can
swerv
to
avoid
obstacl
and
not
the
knowledg
of
physic
between
the
rider
ear
are
you
serious
suggest
that
counterst
knowledg
enabl
you
to
corner
faster
or
more
compet
than
you
could
manag
otherwis
mike
im
extrem
gratifi
for
you
that
you
have
such
a
natur
affin
and
prowess
for
motorcycl
that
formal
train
wa
a
total
wast
of
time
for
you
assum
your
total
train
hasnt
come
from
simpli
from
read
recmotorcycl
howev
of
the
motorcyclist
ive
discus
formal
rider
educ
with
have
regard
the
experi
a
overwhelmingli
posit
thi
regardless
of
the
amount
of
experi
they
brought
into
the
cours
rang
from
minut
to
year
formal
train
in
thi
countri
a
far
a
i
am
awar
doe
not
includ
counterst
theori
i
found
out
about
counterst
about
six
year
ago
from
a
physic
lectur
who
wa
also
a
motorcyclist
i
didnt
believ
him
at
first
when
he
said
i
steer
my
bike
to
the
right
to
make
it
turn
left
but
i
went
out
and
analys
close
what
i
wa
do
and
realiz
he
wa
right
it
an
interest
bit
of
knowledg
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
fun
sinc
then
tell
other
about
it
who
were
at
first
a
sceptic
a
i
wa
but
that
all
it
is
an
interest
bit
of
knowledg
and
to
claim
that
it
is
essenti
for
all
biker
to
know
it
or
that
you
can
corner
faster
or
better
a
a
result
is
absurd
formal
train
is
in
my
view
absolut
essenti
if
your
go
to
be
abl
to
ride
a
bike
properli
and
safe
but
by
includ
counterst
theori
in
newbi
cours
we
are
confus
peopl
unnecessarili
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
import
matter
for
them
to
learn
and
that
wa
my
origin
point
