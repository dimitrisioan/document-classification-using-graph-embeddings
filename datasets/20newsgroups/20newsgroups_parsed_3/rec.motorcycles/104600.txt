best
book
have
been
written
on
that
but
in
regard
to
aerostich
it
realli
depend
on
your
particular
size
shape
and
need
if
you
upper
and

concern
with
good
protect
and
i
believ
that
the
differ
in
protect
between
the
and
piec
suit
is
almost
neglig
i
think
the
option
hip
pad
and
back
protector
make
much
more
of
a
differ
one
thing
that
is
nice
about
the
piec
is
if
you
go
somewher
and
then
want
to
walk
around
for
a
while
still
with
jacket
you
can
just
detach
and
stow
the
pant
one
thing
to
note
is
that
goldfin
ha
problem
get
a
good
fit
for
mani
woman
with
standard
suit
supposedli
for
smaller
woman
and
petit
men
for
that
matter
the
piec
will
fit
better
anoth
recommend
is
to
pay
for
mod
if
you
need
them
