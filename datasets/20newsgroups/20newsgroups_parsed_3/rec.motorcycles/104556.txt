the
best
lock
ive
found
for
bike
is
the
cobra
lock
it
a
cabl
which
is
shroud
by
an
articul
harden
steel
sleev
the
lock
itself
is
cylindr
and
the
lock
pawl
engag
the
joint
at
the
articul
point
so
the
chain
can
be
adjust
like
handcuff
you
cant
get
ani
leverag
on
the
lock
to
break
it
open
and
the
cylind
is
wellprotect
i
wouldnt
want
to
cut
one
of
these
without
a
torch
andor
a
vice
and
heavi
duti
cut
wheel
i
have
a
long
cobralink
lock
that
i
use
to
use
for
my
harley
she
doesnt
get
out
much
anymor
so
i
dont
use
the
lock
that
often
anymor
it
is
made
of
articul
steel
shell
cover
seven
strand
of
steel
cabl
it
is
probabl
enough
to
stop
all
the
joyrid
but
unfortun
profession
can
open
it
rather
easili
freez
a
link
break
frozen
link
with
your
favorit
method
hammer
work
well
snip
through
the
steel
cabl
which
i
have
on
author
are
fright
thin
with
a
set
of
boltcutt
for
the
same
money
you
can
get
a
kryptonit
cabl
lock
which
is
anywher
from
to
thick
steel
cabl
look
like
steel
rope
shield
in
a
flexibl
cover
to
protect
your
bike
finish
and
ha
a
barreltyp
lock
mechan
i
dont
know
if
it
adjust
but
my
sourc
say
it
more
difficult
to
pick
than
most
lock
and
the
cabl
tend
to
squish
flat
in
boltcutt
jaw
rather
than
shear
model
all
bet
are
off
if
the
thief
ha
a
die
grinder
with
a
cutoff
wheel
even
the
most
durabl
lock
test
