random
thought
on

no
substitut
for
a

suffici
power
have
taken
passeng
veri
occasion
on
the
small
etc
bike
i
use
to
ride
in
the
uk

wa
hard
im
now
ride
a
g
and
that
great
even
move
from
my
freind
gsx
i
wa
ride
recent
thi
may
be
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
neither
i
nor
my
regular
passeng
are
particularli
slimlin
i
alway
tell
passeng
stay
in
line
with
the
bike
on
corner
that
make
their
movement
predict
my
regular
passeng
both
tend
to
hold
either
the
rack
or
noth
at
all
i
dont
realli
like
have
a
passeng
hold
onto
me
except
for
short
period
again
that
may
be
bias
by
the
fact
that
ive
had
a
coupl
of
new
passeng
a
friend
recent
for
her
first
time
on
a
