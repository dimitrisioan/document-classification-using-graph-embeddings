futur
would
i
do
better
to
wear
my
total
nondamag
face
dotrat
cheapi
which
doesnt
fit
a
well
or
keep
out
the
wind
a
well
or
wear
the
shoei
rf
which
is
a
lot
more
comfort
keep
the
wind
out
better
is
quieter
but
might
have
some
minor
damag
wear
the
rf
even
after
a
few
drop
paint
chip
it
is
far
better
than
no
helmet
or
a
poorli
fit
one
ive
had
mani
scratch
bang
which
have
been
repair
plu
im
still
confid
of
the
protect
the
helmet
will
continu
to
give
me
onli
when
you
actual
see
depress
or
actual
crack
use
a
magnifi

should
you
consid
replac
thi
is
not
good
advic
a
coupl
of
year
i
wa
involv
in
a
lowspe
getoff
in
which
i
land
on
my
back
on
the
pavement
my
head
helmet
hit
the
pavement
with
a
clunk
leav
a
coupl
of
ding
and
chip
in
the
paint
at
the
point
of
impact
but
no
other
visibl
damag
i
call
the
helmet
manufactur
and
inquir
about
damag
they
said
that
the
way
a
fiberglass
shell
work
is
to
first
give
then
delamin
then
crack
thi
is
the
way
fiberglass
serv
to
spread
the
forc
of
the
impact
over
a
wider
area
after
the
fiberglass
ha
done
it
thing
the
crushabl
foam
liner
take
care
of
absorb
hope
the
remain
impact
forc
they
told
me
that
the
second
stage
of
fiberglass
function
delamin
of
the
glassresin
layer
can
occur
with
no
visibl
sign
either
insid
or
outsid
of
the
helmet
they
suggest
that
i
send
them
the
helmet
and
they
would
inspect
it
includ
xray
i
did
so
they
sent
back
the
helmet
with
a
letter
state
that
that
they
could
find
no
damag
that
would
compromis
the
abil
of
the
helmet
to
provid
maximum
protect
i
suspect
that
thi
letter
would
elimin
their
be
abl
to
claim
prior
damag
to
the
helmet
in
the
event
i
were
to
sue
them
the
bottom
line
though
is
that
it
appear
that
a
helmet
integr
can
be
compromis
with
no
visibl
sign
the
onli
way
to
know
for
sure
is
to
send
it
back
and
have
it
inspect
note
that
some
helmet
manufactur
provid
inspect
servic
and
some
do
not
anoth
point
to
consid
when
purchas
a
lid
ken
franklin
they
say
there
a
heaven
for
peopl
who
wait
ama
and
some
say
it
better
but
i
say
it
aint
gwrra
id
rather
laugh
with
the
sinner
than
cri
with
the
saint
dod
the

more
