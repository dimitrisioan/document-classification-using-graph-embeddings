i
need
a
few
piec
of
inform
ani
stori
on
how
you
all
learn
ill
tell
you
my
stori
a
an
exampl
of
what
not
to
do
earli
in
i
took
some
ride
lesson
from
my
colleg
roommat
on
hi
old
honda
cbt
he
had
taken
the
msf
beginn
cours
so
i
actual
learn
some
of
what
i
need
to
know
to
ride
i
proceed
to
buy
a
beatup
honda
cl
for
and
a
helmet
and
rode
around
wear
thi
and
a
cotton
windbreak
then
i
decid
to
invest
in
a
fullfac
helmet
first
smart
move
sometim
around
then
i
also
pas
my
road
test
on
may
i
got
caught
in
a
rainstorm
on
my
way
home
from
a
mile
trip
enter
the
town
where
i
live
a
rather
urban
suburb
i
had
to
stop
suddenli
for
a
red
light
that
i
notic
too
late
skid
the
rear
tire
out
and
wa
eject
face
upward
into
the
oncom
lane
of
traffic
fortun
for
me
the
oncom
traffic
wa
also
stop
for
the
same
red
light
otherwis
i
might
have
slid
under
a
car
and
been
kill
now
thi
is
anecdot
evid
to
be
sure
but
i
later
took
the
experienc
rider
cours
from
the
msf
and
saw
that
earlier
train
could
have
help
me
greatli
in
your
case
the
need
is
even
greater
sinc
you
have
nobodi
to
help
you
practic
even
the
most
basic
stuff
a
i
did
so
my
advic
is
to
take
the
msf
beginn
cours
first
thing
i
wouldnt
even
buy
a
bike
until
youv
taken
the
cours
unless
you
happen
to
pick
up
a
real
good
deal
and
can
store
it
someplac
until
your
readi
to
use
it
i
onli
have
about
to
work
with
so
that
would
have
to
cover
everyth
bike
helmet
anyth
el
that
im
too
ignor
to
know
i
need
to
buy
while
your
wait
to
take
the
cours
it
might
take
a
few
week
in
dc
a
i
recal
there
were
alway
wait
list
in
boston
could
you
save
up
some
more
money
to
start
out
right
say
for
ride
gear
plu
the
cost
bike
plu
mayb
guess
to
a
mechan
to
make
sure
the
machin
is
safe
assum
you
econom
by
buy
some
old
beatup
machin
from
a
privat
individu
plu
insur
plu
registr
and
licens
fee
plu
the
cours
your
look
at
mayb
not
includ
the
bike
itself
and
a
reserv
for
ongo
mainten
what
is
buy
a
bike
go
to
do
to
my
insur
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parent
have
been
take
care
of
my
insur
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehens
list
of
cost
that
buy
a
motorcycl
is
go
to
insur
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
make
a
differ
i
pay
about
insur
now
upstat
ny
but
it
wa
closer
to
in
boston
more
urban
for
decent
insur
includ
substanti
coverag
for
liabil
which
you
want
unless
you
plan
alway
to
be
poor
id
guess
dc

more
like
boston
than
like
a
rural
area
ergo
more
expens
ani
recommend
on
what
i
should
buywher

should
look
for
it

idea
of

avail
you
could
probabl
look

past
issu
to
size
up
what
use
bike

be
avail

first
bike
wa
year
old
when
