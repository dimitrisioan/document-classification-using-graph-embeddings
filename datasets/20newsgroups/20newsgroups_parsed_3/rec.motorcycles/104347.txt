write
in
heavi
traffic
i
slow
down
a
bit
mostli
so
i
have
more
buffer
zone
in
front
to
balanc
the
minim
buffer
behind
but
i
also
often
find
that
the
jerk
behind
will
notic
traffic
move
faster
in
other
lane
switch
into
one
of
them
and
pas
me
which
is
fine
becaus
then
i
can
keep
a
better
eye
on
the
jerk
from
behind
while
look
ahead
rather
than
from
in
front
while
split
my
attent
between
ahead
and
the
mirror
thi
is

just
make
a

back
off
