re
need
advic
for
ride
with
someon
on
pillion
ive
never
ridden
pillion
veri
much
but
recent
had
an
excel
experi
passeng
with
dave
edmondson
at
pilot
while
in
london
i
found
that
it
upset
the
bike
much
le
if
i
rode
with
the
pilot
that
is
if
i
look
over
hi
shoulder
and
anticip
when
i
should
hold
on
hard
for
brake
or
acceler
i
tri
to
alway
look
over
the
insid
shoulder
on
corner
and
move
a
littl
a
possibl
leav
dave
to
manag
me
and
the
bike
a
he
normal
would
the
bike
and
luggag
hard
acceler
can
be
quit
unnerv
a
the
feel
of
be
spit
off
the
back
is
hard
to
fight
similarli
i
held
on
to
the
grab
handl
tightli
when
dave
need
to
brake
so
a
not
to
mash
him
to
a
pulp
im
a
lot
bigger
than
he
is
reach
around
him
and
push
off
the
tank
seem
like
it
would
be
veri
awkward
and
make
it
even
harder
for
him
to
manag
on
the
rare
occas
when
