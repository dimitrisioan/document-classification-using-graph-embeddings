bill
i
dont

but
i
wonder
how
you

have
you
actual
everi
use
your
secret
method
to
break
all
the
differ
kind
of
bike
lock
or
are
you
take
someon
word
for
it
the
fact
is
it
is
unlik
that
someon
read
anyth
here
is
go
to
go
into
a
success
bikest
busi
becaus
they
read
anyth
in
recmotorcycl
so
plea
tell
u
what
you
are
talk
about
we
cant
even
protect
against
an
assault
or
discus
method
if
you
dont
come
out
with
it
see
i
have
heard
the
one
about
the
pipe
and
the
liquid
nitrogen
and
the
cordless
dremel
tool
and
a
bunch
of
other
one
the
most
plausabl
method
i
am
not
a
bike
thief
so
i
realli
dont
know
for
certain
is
just
to
put
a
rod
through
each
wheel
and
use
four
guy
to
just
lift
the
bike
into
a
truck
thi
work
becaus
most
peopl
dont
lock
their
bike
to
anyth
sinc
that
method
is
so
childishli
easi
i
figur
a
nice
visibl
chain
or
cabl
lock
the
bike
to
someth
is
like
to
make
a
lazi
thief
go
on
to
the
next
bike
hey
final
an
advantag
to
the
weight
and
high
cg
of
the
concour
especi
sinc
i
have
a
bike
that
i
would
hate
to
see
rip
off
by
such
a
trival
tactic
warn
no
lock
alon
is
a
safe
deter
against
theft
the
thief
doesnt
need
to
be
a
locksmith
or
a
lockpick
to
walk
away
with
your
properti
i
person
think
motion
alarm
in
combin
to
a
lock
of
thi
type
is
the
way
to
go
if
in
fact
you
are
that
concern
what
tactic
are
you
refer
to
if
we
dont
know
what
you
are
talk
about
we
cant
veri
well
guard
against
it
can
we
for
my
money
liter
i
reli
on
a
combin
of
a
motiondetector
alarm
with
pager
when
im
out
of
earshot
of
the
bike
in
a
question
area
cc
insur
and
i
tri
to
park
in
obviou
visibl
area
with
lot
of
peopl
about
see
if
someon
just
play
with
the
bike
without
intent
of
steal
it
at
least
some
eye
are
on
it
and
if
they
get
too
rambuncti
theyll
set
off
the
alarm
that
for
a
nice
bike
for
a
ratbik
the
trick
is
to
alway
keep
it
actual
valu
well
below
bluebook
so
that
it
look
so
crappi
nobodi
would
want
to
steal
it
and
even
if
they
were
stupid
enough
to
you
would
make
a
profit
on
the
deal
serious
if
i
for
instanc
need
to
go
on
a
busi
trip
for
a
week
and
sadli
have
to
leav
the
bike
sit
they
both
get
a
shittylook
but
useabl
cover
lock
on
and
both
bike
lock
to
each
other
and
a
curb
bumper
in
the
park
lot
under
the
light
i
usual
rig
the
cabl
lock
i
use
aircraft
cabl
so
that
if
anyon
pull
on
either
bike
or
the
cabl
join
them
the
concour
alarm
goe
off
and
i
have
a
friend
come
buy
everi
day
to
have
a
look
and
make
sure
theyr
still
there
the
onli
thing
i
have
ever
had
stolen
wa
a
cover
and
that
wa
over
winter
storag
with
the
batteri
out
of
the
bike
and
thu
no
alarm
oh
put
your
own
eyelet
into
the
cover
for
the
lock
to
pas
through
and
place
them
so
that
they
have
to
absolut
destroy
the
cover
to
get
it
off
that
the
best
that
i
can
think
of
most
of
the
lock
i
see
peopl
put
on
bike
look
well
not
too
mechan
