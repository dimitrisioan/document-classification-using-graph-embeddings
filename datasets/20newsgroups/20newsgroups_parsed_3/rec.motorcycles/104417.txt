write
on
a
waterski
bike
you
turn
the
handlebar
left
to
lean
right
just
like
on
a
motorcycl
i
dont
think
thi
is
the
case
at
least
not
on
all
jetski
on
my
friend
jetski
bar
turn
left
to
go
left
anyway
all
your
do
there
is
chang
the
yaw
of
the
jet
so
the
relationship
between
the
handlbar
and
the
rearmount
jet
is
complet
arbitrari
simpl
linkag
could
make
it
work
either
way
so
thi
support
the

theori
on
how
to
lean
thi
contradict
the
need
for
gyroscop
precess
to
have
a
counterst
induc
lean
it
seem
to
me
that
jetski
are
even
more
irrelev
to
thi
discuss
than
snow
ski
but
it
ha
been
an
amus
digress
hey
ed
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
you
pull
on
a
hors

left
to
go
left
