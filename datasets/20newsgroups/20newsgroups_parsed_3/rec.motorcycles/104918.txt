write
all
of
u
that
argu
about
gyroscop
etc
throughli
understand
the
techniqu
of
counterst
includ
all
the
one
who
think
that
they
counterst
all
the
way
through
a
corner
well
all
the
way
through
a
decreasingradiu
corner
anyway
thi
is
realli
the
onli
thing
we
disagre
on
mayb
we
should
agre
to
disagre
ok
but
im
right
the
offici
line
here
though
i
do
have
my
doubt
about
it
is
that
the
front
brake
is
appli
first
follow
by
the
rear
brake
the
idea
be
that
you
avoid
lock
up
the
rear
after
weight
transfer
take
place
if
that
the
offici
line
taught
in
those
rider
educ
class
you
were
refer
to
that
also
dont
teach
counterst
i
have
to
question
the
qualiti
of
the
class
the
offici
line
in
msf
curriculum
is
a
i
describ
maximum
brake
is
achiev
by
appli
both
brake
equal
when
the
weight
distribut
is
nomin
even
and
both
tire
have
equal
normal
forc
and
ea
off
on
the
rear
to
prevent
lock
it
and
increas
brake
on
the
front
a
more
traction
is
avail
to
the
front
due
to
increas
normal
forc
due
to
weight
shift
the
offici
line
you
have
been
taught
seem
ineffect
on
the
face
of
it
appli
the
rear
brake
after
the
front
is
not
take
advantag
of
all
the
traction
avail
to
the
rear
at
time
and
is
halv
the
avail
brake
power
by
use
onli
the
front
at
time
say
brake
until
the
tire
just
begin
to
slide
is
next
to
useless
advic
to
a
newbi
he
ha
to
go
out
and
slide
the
tire
to
find
out
where
that
is
it
also
give
him
zero
inform
from
which
to
develop
a
brake
techniqu
that
chang
a
the
brake
and
correspond
weight
shift
develop
if
you
dont
slide
the
tyre
you
have
no
way
of
know
whether
youv
achiev
maximum
brake
or
not
im
not
suggest
that
you
should
alway
aim
to
brake
a
hard
a
you
possibl
can
but
if
you
want
to
find
the
limit
of
the
machin
you
have
to
go
beyond
them
not
necessarili
true
chirp
the
tire
indic
impend
lockup
on
most
surfac
and
serv
a
a
good
guid
to
newbi
to
indic
maximum
brake
i
agre
that
total
lock
the
front
occasion
make
one
a
better
rider
but
it
is
a
manuv
best
save
for
an
experienc
rider
unless
you
have
one
of
those
outrigg
bike
like
code
use
to
use
in
ani
case
for
maximum
brake
if
a
i
suggest
you
aim
to
keep
both
wheel
just
on
the
point
of
slide
then
youll
be
do
exactli
a
you
suggest
true
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
how
to
best
teach
ride
skill
which
is
how
thi
discus
start
keep
both
wheel
just
on
the
point
of
slide
is
nearli
useless
inform
you
need
to
teach
a
techniqu
or
at
least
a
strategi
to
achiev
thi
ed
green
former
ninjait
i
wa
drink
last
night
with
a
biker
and
i
show
him
a
pictur
of
you
i
said
dod
go
on
get
to
know
her
youll
like
her
the
grate
dead
it
seem
like
the
least
i
could
do
