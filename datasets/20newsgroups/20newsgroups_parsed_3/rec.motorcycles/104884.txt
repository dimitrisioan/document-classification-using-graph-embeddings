i
wonder
if
you
a

could
make
some
suggest
a
to
what
ha
and
ha
with

imagin
that
almost
anyth
would

person
im
quit
happi
with
my
eclips
standard
tank
bag
i
think
the
onli
thing
to
watch
for
is
the
number
of
attach
strap
most
come
with
and
some
with
i
have
a
bagman
strap
tankbag
and
becaus
the
rear
of
the
tank
is
so
narrow
the
fit
is
not
optim
good
point
id
overlook
that
the
eclips
ha
a
point
mount
at
the
rear
and
at
the
front
and
it
veri
stabl
on
the
fj
i
have
seen
some
with
har
that
mount
to
the
side
of
the
tank
and
that
would
be
a
real
problem
