had
visibl
damag
to

damageimpact
ratio
wa
scari
i
own
bell
moto
now
have
taken
impact
on
order
of
twice
the
bieff
impact
we

thi
frequent

my
recommend
is

when
your
helmet
nogin
hit

immoveab
object

are
onli
four
thing

dissip
the
energi
the
immov
object
the
helmet
shell
the
helmet
liner
the
rider
head
the
rider
ego
ok
five
assum
that
the
helmet
head
assembl
take
the
same
impact
if
the
shell
crack
in
one
case
then
in
the
other
the
liner
must
be
dent
or
the
head
get
jiggl
if
it
the
the
liner
that
dent
the
helmet
is
just
a
toast
a
if
the
shell
were
crack
it
wont
absorb
energi
form
an
impact
in
that
area
if
it
the
head
that
get
jiggl
mayb
the
new
gear

of
a
high
qualiti
after
