re
drink
and
ride
person
i
follow
the
no
alcohol
rule
when
im
on
a
bike
my
view
is
that
you
have
to
be
in
such
a
high
degre
of
control
that
ani
alcohol
could
be
potenti
hazard
to
my
bike
if
i
get
hurt
it
my
own
fault
but
i
dont
want
to
wreck
my
katana
i
develop
thi
philosophi
from
an
impromptu
experi
i
had
one
beer
at
in
the
even
and
had
volleybal
practic
at
i
wasnt
even
close
to
leagl
intox
but
i
couldnt
perform
even
the
most
basic
thing
until
thi
made
me
think
about
how
i
view
alcohol
and
intox
you
may
seem
fine
but
your
reaction
may
be
affect
such
that
youll
be
unabl
to
recov
from
hit
a
rock
or
even
just
a
gust
of
wind
i
greatli
enjoy
social
drink
but
for
me
it
just
doesnt
mix
with
ride
max
enjoy
eric
