up
tortur
my
knee
and
my
back
by
take
long
ride
a
a
passeng
on
sport

one
of
the
reason
i
origin
like
my
current
guythingi
so
much
wa
becas
he
had
a
bmw
id
suggest
a
shorter
extend
ride
at
first
a
short
turn
in
the
mountain
or
some
such
then
see
how
much
pain
she
in
and
proceed
from
there
the
best
advic
id
give
a
begin
passeng
dont
get
on
the
bike
until
the
rider
say
it
ok
and
work
out
some
sort
signal
for
the
rider
to
tell
you
when
it
ok
to
get
off
after
i
get
on
the
bike
i
squeez
my
rider
hip
to
tell
that
im
readi
and
at
the
stop
he
nod
hi
head
to
show
it
ok
for
me
to
get
off
keep
your
foot
on
the
peg
at
all
time
dont
wiggl
unless
your
rider
ask
you
to
the
best
passeng
are
those
which
are
unobtrus
echo
the
movement
and
lean
of
your

most
comfort
but
dure

on
the
insid
of
the
turn

from
push
your

the
tank
put
your

on
the
tank
is
also
a
good
way
to

in
turn
if
you
leav
them
there
switch
your
hand
to
the
guardrail
to
stretch
your
shoulder
but
be
sure
and
squeez
your
thigh
while
your
do
it
so
your
rider
know
your
still
there
the
guard
rail
isnt
a
safe
a
hold
onto
your

dont
be
afraid
to
ask

frequent
stop
if
your
in

or
lose
feel
in
your
foot
passeng
seat
are
not
gener
design
for
comfort
work

some
sort
of
pull
