write
if
we
are
onli
talk
about
stroke
i
think
i
can
understand
exhaust
pul
affect
in
a
stroke
the
intak
valv
is
close
on
the
exhaust
stroke
and
the
ga
is
push
out
by
the
cyclind
i
guess
there
is
some
ga
compress
that
may
affect
the
amount
push
out
but
the
limit
factor
seem
to
be
the
header
pipe
and
not
the
canist
mean
would
gase
so
far
down
the
line
the
canist
realli
have
an
effect
on

do
the
gase
