over
by
a
chp
black
and
white
by
the

state
it
look
like
you
were
go
kinda
fast
come
down
highway
you
must
have
been
go
at
least
or
i
just
said
okay
and
did
not
agre
or
disagre
to
anyth
he
said
can
you
beat
thi
ticket
person
i
think
it
your
duti
a
a
citizen
to
make
it
a
much
troubl
a
possibl
for
them
so
mayb
theyll
give
up
and
leav
u
alon
someday
soon
the
cop
wa
certainli
within
hi
legal
right
to
nail
you
by
guess
your
speed
mr
brown
the
author
of
fight
your
ticket
mention
an
oakland
judg
who
convict
a
speeder
on
the
offic
testimoni
that
the
driver
car
sound
like
it
wa
be
driven
at
an
excess
speed
you
can
pay
off
the
state
and
your
insur
compani
or
you
can
take
it
to
court
and
be
creativ
person
ive
never
won
that
way
or
seen
anyon
win
but
the
judg
alway
listen
polit
and
i
havent
seen
that
mani
attempt
you
could
tri
the
argument
that
sinc
bike
are
shorter
than
the
car
whose
speed
the
nice
offic
is
accustom
to
guess
they
therefor
appear
to
be
further
away
and
so
their
speed
appear
to
be
greater
than
it
actual
is
i
left
out
a
step
or
two
but
you
get
the
idea
if
you
can
make
it
convinc
theoret
your
suppos
to
win
ive
never
tri
prove
the
cop
wa
mistaken
i
did
get
to
see
some
other
poor
biker
tri
it
he
wa
mix
up
variou
fact
like
the
maximum
acceler
of
a
cop
car
and
the
distanc
at
which
the
cop
had
been
pace
him
and
end
up
demonstr
that
he
couldnt
possibl
have
been
go
a
fast
a
the
cop
had
suggest
hed
brought
diagram
and
a
calcul
he
wa
prepar
he
lost
keep
in
mind
cop
do
thi
all
the
time
and
their
word
is
better
than
your
mayb
though
they
dont
guess
how
fast
bike
are
go
all
the
time
besid
thi
guy
didnt
speak
english
veri
well
and
end
up
absolut
confound
the
judg
the
cop
and
everyon
els
in
the
room
whod
been
recent
crimin
by
some
twit
with
a
gun
and
a
quota
ahem
ok
im
better
now
mayb
hed
have
won
had
hi
present
been
more
polish
mayb
not
he
did
get
applaus
