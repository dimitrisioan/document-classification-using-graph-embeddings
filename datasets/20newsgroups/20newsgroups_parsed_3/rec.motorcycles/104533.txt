formal
train
is
in
my
view
absolut
essenti
if
your
go
to
be
abl
to
ride
a
bike
properli
and
safe
but
by
includ
counterst
theori
in
newbi
cours
we
are
confus
peopl
unnecessarili
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
import
matter
for
them
to
learn
and
that
wa
my
origin
point
mike
while
i
agre
with
you
on
that
formal
train
is
essenti
for
safe
ride
i
disagre
strongli
with
your
origin
point
the
point
of
formal
train
must
be
to
prepar
rider
for
the
road
prepared
is
in
my
opinion
to
know
a
much
a
possibl
so
to
exclud
some
aspect
of
ride
a
bike
in
a
cours
is
wrong
imho
now
to
counterst
in
particular
counterst
is
someth
that
must
be
train
a
common
reaction
among
new
biker
or
bicycl
rider
in
an
emerg
situat
is
to
steer
the
motorcycl
like
a
bicycl
a
we
know
thi
make
the
motorcycl
go
in
the
direct
opposit
to
what
wa
intend
needl
to
say
thi
is
danger
i
have
a
specif
exampl
a
rider
in
a
left
turn
the
rider
think
hesh
is
to
close
to
the
right
shoulder
of
the
road
and
tri
to
steer
the
motorcycl
to
the
left
by
pull
the
left
handl
and
push
the
right
handl
the
motorcycl
straighten
up
and
go
off
the
road
a
wors
scenario
the
same
rider
same
turn
in
the
middl
of
the
turn
the
rider
see
a
truck
come
toward
himher
the
panick
rider
tri
to
steer
the
motorcycl
away
from
the
truck
and
crash
right
into
it
the
main
function
of
a
ride
cours
is
to
teach
how
to
avoid
emerg
situat
and
what
to
do
if
in
one
thu
the
knowledg
and
train
of
counterst
is
imho
a
must
in
ani
ride
cours
