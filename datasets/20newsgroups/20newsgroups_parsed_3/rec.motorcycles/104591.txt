more
than
two
year
ago
and
ye
ive

your

hey
man
you
brought
it
up
i
agre
complet
drive
drunk
is
realli
stupid
and
i
understand
and
appreci
that
you
feel
bad
about
it
but
dwi
is
endem
in
our
societi
it
is
a
real
problem
and
we
a
motorcyclist
can
be
in
the
worst
of
vulner
posit
around
a
drunk
driver
alert
reader
might
rememb
that
last
year
i
wit
a
dwi
accid
right
bloodi
in
front
of
me
and
wa
unabl
to
save
the
life
of
one
of
the
particip
a
i
report
here
also
drunk
drive
by
motorcyclist
is
a
prime
caus
of
their
injuri
and
death
which
rais
the
insur
rate
forc
stupidli
restrict
law
and
turn
the
public
against
those
of
u
who
ride
respons
in
my
view
drunk
drive
should
carri
a
mandatori
prison
sentenc
it
is
one
of
the
traffic
offens
which
is
not
a
public
fund
issu
but
a
genuin
safeti
issu
so
if
you
bring
up
the
subject
on
recmoto
admit
have
been
caught
dwi
and
look
for
sympathi
over
the
consequ
dont
expect
peopl
to
respond
with
warm
wish
