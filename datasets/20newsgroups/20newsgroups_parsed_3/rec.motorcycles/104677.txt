i
had
a
bad
experi
w
a
krypto
lock
too
last
year
i
bought
a
krypto
cabl
ii
x
long
someth
like
that
that
by
all
standard
seem
like
a
decent
piec
until
i
use
it
anyway
so
in
short
the
cabl
seem
to
be
pretti
useless
i
would
guess
the
larger
cabl
seem
to
be
a
much
better
unit
ive
got
the
larger
cabl
about
inch
in
diamet
actual
i
think
it
larger
about
foot
long
which
coil
into
a
or
inch
coil
with
the
tubular
key
lock
like
the
ulock
it
ha
work
fine
for
me
for
two
year
now
and
seem
to
me
anyway
that
it
is
veri
secur
it
doesnt
have
the
weak
that
the
ulock
have
other
than
the
liquid
nitrogen
trick
supposedli
is
much
easier
to
store
in
my
tankbag
than
a
ulock
and
more
versatil
i
got
mine

one
of
the
