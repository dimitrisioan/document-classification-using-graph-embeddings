id
say
thi

a
veri
bad
idea
you

someth
much
mellow
so
that
neither
one
of
you
get
in
over
your

that
particular
road
requir
full

not
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
to
take
a
passeng
on

the
first
time
onc
you
both
decid
that
you
like
ride
togeth
and
want
to
do
someth
longer
and
more
challeng
then
go
for
a
hard
core
road
like

it
your
moral
respons
to
