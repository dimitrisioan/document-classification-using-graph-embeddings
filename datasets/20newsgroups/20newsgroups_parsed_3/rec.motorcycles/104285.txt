write
watch
out
often
when
some
scumbag
steal
the
cover
that
mean
that
they
were
or
are
look
to
steal
the
bike
in
my
case
i
had
a
fade
cover
stolen
off
a
bmw
rr
that
wa
stash
in
an
apart
carport
and
not
visibl
from
the
street
they
evid
decid
the
beemer
wasnt
worth
steal
but
did
tri
the
next
night
to
steal
a
honda
hurrican
park
in
the
next
apart
build
a
neighbor
heard
them
wheel
it
out
and
call
the
cop
i
know
thi
is
just
set
myself
up
but
thi
is
actual
one
of
the
thing
that
is
realli
good
about
bmw
bike
from
all
account
ive
heard
practic
no
one
steal
bmw
probabl
it
is
similar
for
moto
guzzi
and
other
rel
exot
sinc
there
isnt
a
larg
demand
for
part
and
the
bike
would
be
much
easier
to
track
down
it
seem
that
the
most
stolen
bike
are
harley
and
