throughli
understand
the
techniqu
of
counterst
includ
all
the
one
who
think
that
they
counterst
all
the
way
through
a
corner
the
underli
physic
are
a
differ
matter
and
need
not
be
taught
to
beginn
agre
counterst
the
techniqu
should
be
taught
for
onli
with
understand
of
the
techniqu
can
one
develop
maxim
effect
emerg
avoid
manuv
thi
is
realli
the
onli
thing
we
disagre
on
mayb
we
should
agre
to
disagre
i
still
think
that
tell
newbi
to
steer
left
to
turn
to
the
right
is
unnecessarili
confus
when
theyll
do
it
anyway
if
they
just
get
on
the
bike
and
ride
the
damn
thing
i
know
exactli
what
happen
it
those
other
git
that
havent
a
clue
me
too
understand
the
physic
of
traction
is
fine
but
i
can
not
see
how
detail
theori
like
that
ha
ani
place
in
a
motorcyl
train
cours
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
maximum
traction
is
obtain
with
the
tyre
just
begin
to
slide
against
the
road
then
we
are
in
violent
disagr
while
what
you
state
is
true
it
is
insuffici
to
form
a
traction
manag
polici
avail
traction
increas
with
appli
normal
forc
ie
traction
avail
to
the
front
wheel
increas
a
weight
shift
under
brake
forc
and
correspondingli
decreas
at
the
rear
thu
a
techniqu
of
appli
both
brake
and
ea
off
the
rear
and
increas
pressur
on
the
front
can
best
be
learn
with
an
understand
of
weight
shift
and
avail
traction
jeez
ed
when
you
start
talk
about
traction
manag
polici
i
thought
you
were
make
some
weird
refer
to
look
after
railway
locomot
the
offici
line
here
though
i
do
have
my
doubt
about
it
is
that
the
front
brake
is
appli
first
follow
by
the
rear
brake
the
idea
be
that
you
avoid
lock
up
the
rear
after
weight
transfer
take
place
in
practic
i
suspect
most
peopl
do
what
you
describ
say
brake
until
the
tire
just
begin
to
slide
is
next
to
useless
advic
to
a
newbi
he
ha
to
go
out
and
slide
the
tire
to
find
out
where
that
is
it
also
give
him
zero
inform
from
which
to
develop
a
brake
techniqu
that
chang
a
the
brake
and
correspond
weight
shift
develop
if
you
dont
slide
the
tyre
you
have
no
way
of
know
whether
youv
achiev
maximum
brake
or
not
im
not
suggest
that
you
should
alway
aim
to
brake
a
hard
a
you
possibl
can
but
if
you
want
to
find
the
limit
of
the
machin
you
have
to
go
beyond
them
in
ani
case
for
maximum
brake
if
a
i
suggest
you
aim
to
keep
both
wheel
just
on
the
point
of
slide
then
youll
be
do
exactli
a
you
suggest
