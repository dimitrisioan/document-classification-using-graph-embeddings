singletrack
snow
vehicl
with
front
ski
and
snow
ski
attach
to
skier
leg
deform
the
surfac
of
the
snow
creat
their
own
bank
ice
skate
alter
the
phase
of
the
ice
and
also
carv
out
their
own
track
so
what
so
they
have
bugger
all
to
do
with
motorcycl
henc
ani
appar
similar
in
handl
characterist
may
or
may
not
be
analag
in
it
underli
physic
to
that
behind
motorcycl
handl
characterist
ok
a
one
last
attempt
ill
take
a
differ
tack
we
all
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
there
are
two
explan
for
whi
one
can
use
the
handlebar
to
lean
a
move
motorcycl
the
question
is
is
one
of
the
effect
domin
and
which
one
is
it
the
idea
would
be
to
design
an
experi
which
would
seaprat
the
two
characterist
and
see
which
effect
produc
a
similar
result
to
the
one
with
which
those
of
u
who
have
bike
are
familiar
let
look
at
the
one
that
so
far
ha
spark
no
controversi
on
it
own
gyroscop
precess
to
examin
thi
alon
we
would
have
to
get
rid
of
the
contact
patch
effect
by
not
allow
the
contact
patch
to
transmit
ani
forc
the
wheel
and
steer
mechan
would
have
to
remain
and
be
attach
to
a
vehicl
with
about
the
same
weight
a
a
bike
through
suspens
so
that
the
wheel
transmit
forc
to
the
bike
the
same
way
similar
to
a
bike
an
experi
would
be
to
ride
a
bike
along
a
dri
road
to
get
move
and
to
get
the
wheel
spin
then
chang
surfac
to
someth
that
wont
transmit
forc
through
the
contact
patch
and
tri
a
steer
manoeuvr
to
see
if
the
bike
lean
it
probabl
would
sinc
some
of
u
know
how
easi
it
is
to
fall
down
on
ice
but
we
wouldnt
get
a
good
idea
of
how
well
or
what
it
feel
like
becaus
without
the
contact
patch
we
cant
turn
mayb
there
a
better
way
besid
even
ice
doesnt
get
rid
of
the
contact
patch
forc
altogeth
so
wed
have
to
find
a
realli
frictionless
surfac
youd
have
to
tri
it
again
with
the
wheel
lock
to
realli
know
if
it
wa
the
rotat
that
did
it
look
at
the
contactpatch
effect
onli
howev
is
fairli
simpl
now
we
have
to
find
a
vehicl
that
get
the
about
the
same
magnitud
and
direct
of
cantact
patch
forc
a
a
motorcycl
and
transmit
them
about
the
same
way
to
the
vehicl
but
without
rotat
wheel
how
it
get
the
contact
patch
forc
is
irrelev
were
just
look
for
someth
that
ha
contact
patch
that
can
go
straight
and
not
sideway
and
ski
or
skate
would
do
fine
i
dont
know
of
ani
snowski
or
skate
bike
but
up
here
we
have
the
suzuki
wetbik
that
is
arrang
like
a
motorcycl
but
ha
fat
water
ski
where
there
should
be
wheel
i
think
the
propellor
is
in
front
of
the
rear
ski
or
someth
like
that
but
we
could
tri
it
at
a
coast
to
get
rid
of
most
of
it
effect
now
i
admit
that
thi
is
second
hand
info
although
id
love
to
tri
one
of
these
but
the
review
in
the
local
cycl
rag
and
a
guy
in
a
bike
shop
that
sell
them
both
say
that
thi
machin
handl
veri
much
like
a
motorcycl
in
that
you
counterst
it
to
turn
so
we
have
contact
patch
that
transmit
similar
forc
to
a
bike
a
similar
suspens
arrang
and
no
gyroscop
but
we
do
have
counterst
conclus
you
dont
need
gyroscop
to
counterst
vehicl
that
have
motorcyclelik
contact
patch
arrang
we
still
dont
know
what
real
effect
the
gyroscop
have
when
theyr
there
but
from
my
observ
of
how
handlebar
angl
forc
etc
relat
to
steer
in
gener
im
will
to
bet
that
theyr
not
the
domin
factor
in
counterst
if
you
dont
like
thi
conclus
then
dont
accept
it
but
my
motorcycl
behaviour
is
consist
with
it
if
someon
can
prove
otherwis
go
ahead
ive
