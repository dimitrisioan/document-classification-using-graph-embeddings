a
wheeli
monster
of
cours

didnt
have
the
initi
power
burst
to
just
twist
it
into
the
air
i
had
to
pop
the
clutch
i
also
had
to
replac
front

few
time
a
well
the
fair
is
a
bit
heavi
to
be
slam
down
onto
those
littl
stantion
tube
all
the
time
but

thi
wa
no
cheap
fix

there
is
some
kind
of
slip
devic
in
