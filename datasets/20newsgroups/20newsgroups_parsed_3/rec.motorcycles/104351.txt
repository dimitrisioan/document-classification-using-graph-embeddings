we
all
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
there
are
two
explan
for
whi
one
can
use
the
handlebar
to
lean
a
move
motorcycl
the
question
is
is
one
of
the
effect
domin
and
which
one
is
it
the
idea
would
be
to
design
an
experi
which
would
seaprat
the
two
characterist
and
see
which
effect
produc
a
similar
result
to
the
one
with
which
those
of
u
who
have
bike
are
familiar
a
you
point
out
the
experi
would
be
difficult
but
we
know
enough
about
the
physic
of
the
situat
to
do
some
calcul
there
are
in
fact
three
effect
contribut
to
lean
the
bike
over
to
begin
a
turn
gyro
effect
caus
a
torqu
which
twist
the
bike
over
contact
patch
have
shift
to
one
side
caus
bike
to
fall
over
contact
patch
be
acceler
to
the
side
caus
a
torqu
which
twist
the
bike
over
take
an
averag
bikerid
averag
bike
wheel
and
at
speed
of
and
mph
say
calcul
how
much
twist
of
the
bar
would
be
need
to
produc
say
degre
of
lean
in
say
second
by
each
effect
alon
my
guess
is
that
at
slow
speed
is
domin
and
at
high
speed
is
domin
and
at
all
speed
contribut
not
far
off
bugger
all
rel
speak
by
the
way
a
similar
problem
is
thi
how
doe
a
runner
who
want
to
run
round
a
corner
get
lean
into
the
corner
fast
is
there
a
run
group
where
we
could
start
counterfoot
argument
and
have
them
all
fall
over
a
they
tri
to
work
out
how
they
go
