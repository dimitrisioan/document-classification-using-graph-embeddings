talk
to
a
coupl
peopl
about
helmet
drop
im
get
about
dont
sweat
it
you
might
think
about
replac
it
and
the
other
dont
ride
with
it
go
without
a
helmet
first
is
there
ani
way
to
tell
if
a
helmet
is
damag
structur
i
drop
it
about
foot
to
cement
off
my
seat
chip
the
paint
didnt
seem
to
screw
up
the
actual
shell
id
bet
the
price
of
the
helmet
that
it
okayfrom
foot
or
higher
mayb
not
if
i
dont
end
up
replac
it
in
the
real
near
futur
would
i
do
better
to
wear
my
total
nondamag
face
dotrat
cheapi
which
doesnt
fit
a
well
or
keep
out
the
wind
a
well
or
wear
the
shoei
rf
which
is
a
lot
more
comfort
keep
the
wind
out
better
is
quieter
but
might
have
some
minor
damag
id
wear
the
full
facer
but
then
id
be
way
more
worri
about
wind
blast
in
the
face
and
inabl
to
hear
polic
siren
than
the
helmet
be
a
littl
damag
also
what
would
you
all
reccomend
a
far
a
good
helmet
im
slightli
disappoint
by
how
badli
the
shoei
ha
scratch
etc
from
not
be
bloodi
care
about
it
and
how
littl
impact
it
took
to
chip
the
paint
and
arguabl
mess
it
up
period
look
at
a
realli
good
fullfac
with
good
vent
wind
protect
i
like
the
shoei
style
kinda
like
the
norton
one
i

go
to
have
to
get
a
much
more
expens
helmet
if
i
want
to
not
replac
it
everi
time
im
not
be
care
where
i
set
it
down
well
my
next
helmet
will
be
subject
to
it
fit
well
an
agv
sukhoi
that
just
becaus
i
like
the
look
my
current
one
is
a
shoei
task
and
it
get
a
littl
old
and
i
crash
in
it
onc
a
coupl
of

of
that
if

and
cheap
christ
i
dont
treat
my
head
