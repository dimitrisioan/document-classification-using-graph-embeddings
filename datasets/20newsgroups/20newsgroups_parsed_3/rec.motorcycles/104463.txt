bellyach

asid

in

dont
you
have
ani
requir
for
yearli
plate
sticker
in
the
u
in
ontario
and
manitoba
for
sure
and
the
other
provinc
i
think
you
have
to
show
proof
of
insurnac
when
you
renew
your
plate
ie
get
a
new
sticker
ye
unfortun
there
is
also
the
concept
that
the
owner
of
a
car
is
not
respons
for
the
action
of
ani
author
user
of
the
car
that
one
of
the
biggest
argument
against
photoradar
ticket
system
you
also
get
to
pay
all
outstand
ticket
they
even
have
cross
provinc
agreement
at
least
between
ontario
and
quebec
so
that
unpaid
ticket
in
the
other
provinc
are
on
record
no
have
an
up
to
date
sticker
is
a
bad
troubl
with
that
is
you
then
have
no
recours
if
a
misissu
