too
much
of

but
what
sort
of
of
advic
should

give
her
befor
we
go
i
want
her
to
hold
onto
me
rather
than

grab
rail
out
back
and
ive
heard
that
she
should
look
over
my
shoulder
in
the
direct
were
turn
so
she
lean
with
me
but
what
el
are
there
tradit
if
the
ninja
ha
adjust
suspens
adjust
it
to
a
stiffer
set
so
you
dont
bottom
out
in
bumpi
curv
tell
her
the
cardin
rule
are
a
never
ever
ever
ever
put
her
foot
down
not
when
you
stop
at
a
stop
sign
not
when
she
think
your

na
crash
never
keep
them
on
the
peg
until
you
tell
her
to
get
off

b
she
is
to
hold
onto

waist
she
should
hold
on
tightli
enough
that
she
wont
slide
off
the
bike
if
you
twist
the
throttl
a
bit
and
ad
bonu
for
you
here
she

stop
dont

slide
into
you
and
knock
your
ball
up
onto
the
ga
tank

thi
c
just
stay

just
go
with

bike
and
stay
perpendicular
dont
look
over

rememb
at
all

and
stop
smoother
than

awar
that
if
you
jump
on
the
brake
your
go
to
have
the
equival
of
a
