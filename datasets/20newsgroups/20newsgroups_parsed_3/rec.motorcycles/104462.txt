batteri
storag
whi
not
charg
and
store
dri
so
it
look
like
im
go
to
have
to
put
a
coupl
of
bike
in
storag
for
a
few
month
start
sever
month
from
now
and
im
alreadi
contempl
how
to
do
it
so
theyr
a
easi
to
get
go
again
a
possibl
i
have
everyth
under
control
i
think
besid
the
batteri
i
know
that
if
i
buy
a
batteri
tender
for
each
one
and
leav
them
plug
in
the
whole
time
the
bike
are
in
storag
theyll
be
fine
but
im
not
sure
that
necessari
ive
never
heard
anyon
discus
thi
idea
so
mayb
there
some
reason
whi
it
isnt
so
great
but
mayb
someon
can
tell
me
would
it
be
a
mistak
to
fulli
charg
the
batteri
drain
the
electrolyt
into
separ
contain
one
for
each
batteri
seal
the
contain
close
up
the
batteri
and
leav
them
that
way
then
it
would
seem
that
when
the
bike
come
out
of
storag
i
could
put
the
electrolyt
back
in
the
batteri
and
they
should
still
be
fulli
charg
what
wrong
with
thi
on
a
relat
but
differ
note
for
you
