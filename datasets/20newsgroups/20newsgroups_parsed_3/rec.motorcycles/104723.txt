write
the
other
day
it
wa
rain
cat
and
dog
therefor
i
wa
go
onli
to
the
speed
limit
on
noth
more
on
my
bike
thi
guy
in
hi
bmw
wa
drive
meter
behind
me
for
meter
and
at
the
next
red
light
i
calmli
put
the
bike
on
it
leg
walk
back
to
thi
car
he
roll
down
the
window
and
i
told
him
he
wa
a
total
idiot
and
the
reason
whi
did
i
do
the
right
thing
well
i
use
to
get
mad
and
either
tri
to
commun
my
anger
to
jerk
or
to
uhm
educ
them
in
how
to
improv
their
manner
in
traffic
now
i
just
tri
to
get
them
off
my
tail
in
heavi
traffic
i
slow
down
a
bit
mostli
so
i
have
more
buffer
zone
in
front
to
balanc
the
minim
buffer
behind
but
i
also
often
find
that
the
jerk
behind
will
notic
traffic
move
faster
in
other
lane
switch
into
one
of
them
and
pa
me
which
is
fine
becaus
then
i
can
keep
a
better
eye
on
the
jerk
from
behind
while
look
ahead
rather
than
from
in
front
while
split
my
attent
between
ahead
and
the
mirror
in
traffic
so
heavi
that
there
is
no
way
for
the
jerk
to
pa
i
might
pull
over
a
if
to
look
for
a
street
number
or
name
still
ignor
the
jerk
just
to
get
the
jerk
off
my
tail
if
thi
all
sound
well
wimpi
or
undenizenli
or
pessimist
or
perhap
for
ani
psych
type
passiveaggress
consid
that
i
prefer
to
get
my
adrenalin
jolli
from
ride
rather
than
from
yell
at
jerk
a
ride
can
improv
my
whole
day
while
yell
at
a
jerk
is
like
for
me
to
ruin
my
ride
or
my
day
with
my
own
anger
in
the
worst
case
yell
at
the
jerk
could
ruin
my
life
sinc
even
a
tini
jerk
in
a
cage
behind
me
is
better
arm
with
the
cage
than
i
am
on
a
bike
on
the
other
hand
you
might
tri
subtli
arrang
to
be
the
last
vehicl
to
legal
cross
one
or
more
intersect
leav
the
jerk
wait
for
cross
traffic
and
thu
off
your
tail
or
cross
illeg
hope
in
front
of
the
wait
polic
like
almost
everyth
here
