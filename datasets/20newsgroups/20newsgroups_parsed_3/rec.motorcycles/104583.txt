for

kryptonit
cabl
lock
which
is
anywher
from
to
thick
steel
cabl
look
like
steel
rope
shield
in
a
flexibl
cover
to
protect
your
bike
finish
and
ha
a
barreltyp
lock
mechan
i
dont
know
if
it
adjust
but
my
sourc
say
it
more
difficult
to
pick
than
most
lock
and
the
cabl
tend
to
squish
flat
in
boltcutt
jaw
rather
than
shear
model
fyi
ill
be
get
a
krypto
cabl
next
paycheck
a
word
of
warn
though
kryptonit
also
sell
almost
useless
cabl
lock
under
the
kryptonit
name
when
i
obtain
my
second
motorcycl
i
migrat
one
of
my
kryptonit
ulock
from
my
bicycl
to
the
new
bike
i
then
went
out
shop
for
a
new
lock
for
the
bicycl
for
about
the
same
money
i
had
the
choic
of
a
kryptonit
cabl
lock
advantag
lock
front
and
back
wheel
on
bicycl
and
keep
them
both
kryptonit
name
or
a
cheesi
nonam
ulock
advantag
real
steel
i
chose
the
kryptonit
cabl
after
le
than
a
week
i
took
it
back
in
disgust
and
exchang
it
for
the
cheesi
nonam
ulock
first
the
krypto
cabl
i
bought
is
not
made
by
kryptonit
is
not
cover
by
the
kryptonit
guarante
and
doesnt
even
approach
kryptonit
standard
of
qualiti
and
qualiti
assur
it
is
just
some
gener
madeintaiwan
cabl
lock
with
the
kryptonit
name
on
it
secondli
the
latch
engag
mechan
is
someth
of
a
joke
i
dont
know
if
mine
wa
a
particularli
poor
exampl
but
it
wa
often
quit
frustrat
to
get
the
latch
to
posit
engag
and
sometim
it
would
seem
to
engag
onli
to
fall
open
when
i
went
to
unlock
it
thirdli
the
lock
ha
a
littl
plastic
door
on
the
keyway
which
serv
the
sole
purpos
of
frustrat
ani
attempt
to
insert
the
key
in
the
dark
i
didnt
tri
it
obvious
but
i
have
my
doubt
that
the
lock
mechan
would
stand
up
to
an
insert
screwdriv
and
torqu
attack
fourthli
the
cabl
wa
not
in
my
opinion
of
suffici
thick
to
deter
theft
for
my
piec
of
crap
bicycl
that
is
all
cabl
suffer
the
weak
that
they
can
be
cut
a
few
strand
at
a
time
if
you
are
patient
you
can
cut
cabl
with
fingernail
clipper
aviat
snip
would
go
through
the
cabl
in
well
under
a
minut
