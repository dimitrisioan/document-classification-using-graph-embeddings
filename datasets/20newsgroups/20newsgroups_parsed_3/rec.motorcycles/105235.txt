mc
power
arc
ignit
but
ha
not
yet

i
recogn
it
more
fun

but
how
bout
some
comment
on
singl
fire
ignit
for
a
while
i
just
instal
a
mc
power
arc
ii
and
it
seem
to
run
great
i
also
use
mc
coil
and
neither
the
ignit
modul
or
the
coil
requir
ani
new
mount
hole
to
be
drill
on
my
fxstc
a
littl
solder

real
easi
to
set
too
on
the
other
side
