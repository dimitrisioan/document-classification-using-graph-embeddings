no
all
i
am
say
is
that
you
dont
even
need
to
tell
peopl
the
techniqu
of
counterst
co
they
will
do
it
intuit
the
first
time
they
tri
to
go
round
a
corner
some
will
and
other
will
steer
with
their
tuchus
i
dont
know
how
much
the
teach
of
counterst
in
the
beginn
cours
realli
help
the
tuchu
steerer
i
wa
one
i
guess
that
i
alway
steer
a
bicycl
that
way
and
i
onli
got
the
hang
of
counterst
in
normal
ride
after
the
cours
i
could
do
the
counterst
swerv
in
the
cours
no
problem
but
i
onli
start
use
it
in
my
normal
ride
when
i
decid
that
my
turn
at
speed
offramp
and
the
like
wa
a
lot
more
difficult
that
it
should
have
been
i
knew
how
it
work
although
that
current
up
for
debat
definit
knew
that
it
work
a
i
could
do
it
in
swerv
but
onli
figur
it
out
later
in
my
normal
ride
just
a
data
point
i
think
that
it
not
a
bad
idea
to
bring
the
idea
up
but
it
best
to
let
everyon
tuchusst
for
the
first
lesson
or
two
so
they
can
learn
to
shift
gear
befor
they
have
to
worri
about
proper
handlebar
techniqu
counterst
in
fact
my
experienc
rider
cours
instructor
claim
that
they
could
get
on
behind
a
new
rider
and
make
the
bike
turn
to
whichev
side
they
want
just
by
shift
their
weight
around
even
when
the
oper
wa
tri
to
turn
in
the
opposit
direct

admit
ive
never
actual
seen

i
have
in
our
beginn
cours
we
had
passeng
train

dure
the
lesson
the
instructor
would
hop
on
the
back
of
the
bike
and
the
student
would
take
him
for
a
ride
if
the
student
did
not
give
the
instructor
the
you
are
a
sack
of
potato
passeng
speech
the
instructor
would
steer
the
bike
and
make
a
gener
nuisanc
of
himself
