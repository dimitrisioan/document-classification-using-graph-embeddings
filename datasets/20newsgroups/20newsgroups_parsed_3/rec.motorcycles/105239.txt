hello

veri
happi

my
new
rg
my
rang
is
mile
on
gallon
that
mpg
surprisingli
the
bike
is
a
real
cruiser
i
wa
expect
someth
rough
she
a
sweet
backroad
honey
and
i
can
go
pretti
much
anyplac
id
take
my
mountain
bike
a
far
a
shaft
effect
it
more
a
torqu
effect
from
the
crankshaft
in
my
opinion
rev
it
sit
still
when
the
driveshaft
is
not
move
and
the
bike
twist
a
bit
mayb
if
the
clutch
is
in
then
a
larg
chunk
of
counterrot
mass
is
not
rotat
henc
at
a
light
reve
make
it
twist
shaft
effect
is
the
rear
end
rise
under
power
or
the
real
problem
get
lower
to
the
road
when
the
throttl
is
snap
shut
say
when
you
are
corner
and
the
head
are
real
close
to
the
road
new
g
bike
with
the
paralev
shaft
have
almost
no
shaft
effect
i
dont
ride
her
fast
enough
to
get
a
shaft
effect
but
in
my
opinion
a
littl
buffet
by
wind
is
of
far
greater
consequ
okay
here
are
my
question
ani
recommend
for
a
homemad
fair
id
like
to
keep
the
wind
off
my
chest
and
perhap
my
helmet
for
comfort
at
highway
speed
mph
yet
dont
want
to
a
screw
up
the
stabil
or
b
block
my
vision
too
much
for
trail
ride
anybodi
have
luck
with
twopiec
detach
fair
id
like
to
make
it
myself
out
of
plexigla
i
run
two
light
the
standard
headlamp
plu
a
sidelamp
mount
on
the
crash
bar
the
illumin
excel
that
way
with
a
full
beam
come
out
from
the
level
of
the
motor
left
side
the
lamp
beam
is
linear
so
that
you
get
a
bright
streak
of
illumin
from
left
to
right
and
it
realli
pick
up
the
peripheri
deer
lurk
etc
combin
with
the
headlamp
on
high
you
can
see
like
day
but
ive
heard
that
bmw
altern
dont
crank
out
too
much
do
i
need
to
shut
down
the
sidelamp
when
im
putter
around
in
the
dirt
at
low
rpm
it
a
question
of
how
long
you
spend
at
low
rpm
and
how
much
you
need
the
extra
light
at
low
rpm
k
and
under
they
dont
charg
all
that
much
if
at
all
the
altern
put
out
suffici
wattag
it
just
that
you
need
to
be
at
k
rpm
to
get
it
thi
is
embarass
im
have
troubl
start
the
bike
first
thing
in
the
morn

section
of
the
paper

thi
a
zen
thing
full
choke
open
the
ga
tap

the
throttl
to
be
rais
just
a
bit
off
idl
it
an
experi
thing
like
zen
it
hard
to
describ
it
can
be
hard
to
learn
if
you
arent
pay
atttent
to
the
differ
between
success
and
failur
especi
if
you
get
realli
piss
off
and
flatten
