i
understand
whi
you
theoret
stop
so
far
behind
a
car
but
can
you
realli
in
actual
avoid
such
an
incid
suggest
glad
to
hear
that
the
bozo
manag
to
stop
ive
onli
been
ride
for
about
two
year
but
here
are
my
rule
for
traffic
light
surviv
i
tri
to
never
stop
just
over
a
hill
behind
a
car
if
i
have
to
stop
in
such
a
locat
i
pull
almost
complet
next
to
the
car
in
front
of
me
if
im
the
onli
one
ie
no
car
in
front
i
turn
the
bike
somewhat
sideway
across
the
lane
to
increas
my
visibl
to
ani
oncom
vehicl
make
sure
to
keep
your
taillight
visibl
to
traffic
though
note
my
bike
is
bright
white
turn
sideway
on
a
black
bike
might
not
be
a
benefici
on
a
flat
road
i
stop
with
a
bit
of
room
ahead
of
me
usual
about
two
or
three
bike
length
thi
will
hope
give
me
room
to
pull
forward
and
to
the
side
a
a
car
approach
if
you
are
the
last
in
a
line
of
vehicl
watch
your
mirror
constantli
if
you
see
a
vehicl
approach
and
cant
see
ani
evid
to
indic
that
hesh
is
slow
down
get
out
of
the
way
now
flicker
your
brake
light
if
im
the
last
vehicl
in
line
i
will
pull
and
releas
the
brake
a
a
car
approach
from
behind
notic
the
car
by
watch
my
mirror
of
cours
i
vari
the
speed
of
the
flicker
hope
to
make
the
cager
notic
that
there
someth
in
the
lane
ahead
of
him
now
with
all
that
said
it
the
situat
where
you
are
first
in
line
that
i
feel
most
defenseless
if
your
first
in
line
your
forward
escap
rout
is
serious
limit
you
can
onli
move
forward
to
the
extent
that
you
dont
enter
the
intersect
i
leav
some
room
behind
the
stop
line
although
around
here
the
light
activ
are
alway
right
up
next
to
the
stop
line
and
watch
the
mirror
i
think
ive
decid
that
hop
off
the
bike
might
be
the
best
way
out
of
thi
situat
ani
other
idea
for
be
first
in
line
with
no
traffic
