watch
out
often
when
some
scumbag
steal
the
cover
that
mean
that
they
were
or
are
look
to
steal
the
bike
in
my
case
i
had
a
fade
cover
stolen
off
a
bmw
rr
that
wa
stash
in
an
apart
carport
and
not
visibl
from
the
street
they
evid
decid
the
beemer
wasnt
worth
steal
but
did
tri
the
next
night
to
steal
a
honda
hurrican
park
in
the
next
apart
build
a
neighbor
heard
them
wheel
it
out
and
call
the
cop
i
know
thi
is
just
set
myself
up
but
thi
is
actual
one
of
the
thing
that
is
realli
good
about
bmw
bike
from
all
account
ive
heard
practic
no
one
steal
bmw
probabl
it
is
similar
for
moto
guzzi
and
other
rel
exot
sinc
there
isnt
a
larg
demand
for
part
and
the
bike
would
be
much
easier
to
track
down
it
seem
that
the
most
stolen
bike
are
harley
and
cc
jap
sport
bike
well
id
say
your
mostli
right
but
for
differ
reason
btw
a
of
a
coupl
year
ago
the
most
stolen
bike
in
orang
counti
and
sf
were
gsx
and
ninja
probabl
the
biggest
reason
bmw
arent
rip
off
is
that
most
peopl
who
buy
bmw
will
onli
deal
with
the
actual
bmw
dealer
or
mail
order
type
most
of
these
can
have
their
inventori
check
fairli
easili
by
lawenforc
type
and
their
markup
is
usual
suffici
to
keep
them
honest
about
acquir
part
for
harley
and
ricerocket
youv
got
differ
situat
there
is
a
huge
aftermarket
in
harley
part
so
a
bike
can
be
part
out
fairli
easili
ditto
the
nonsport
japanes
bike
but
the
price
on
the
part
for
these
are
not
a
high
compar
for
the
rocket
anytim
a
bike
go
down
the
plastic
is
usual
crack
and
is
expens
to
replac
it
fairli
easi
then
for
a
disreput
shop
to
take
a
fair
from
a
stolen
bike
slap
it
on
a
bike
in
for
repair
repaint
it
and
make
a
tidi
profit
the
other
part
more
traceabl
can
be
use
or
discard
if
they
are
too
traceabl
mike
disclaim
these
