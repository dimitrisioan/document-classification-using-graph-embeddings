for
ride
with
someon

a
passeng
doesnt
realli
depend
on
the
type
of

the

reason
he
doesnt
have

doe
fine
i
still
wouldnt
take

all
switch
back
and
reversecenteruncrown
roadway
not
to
mention
the
bdc
and
squid
who
will
also
be
on
that
particular
road
he
ask
for
advic
and
even
though
it
wasnt
what
he
meant

still
consid
it
some
of
the
best
