subject
re
insect
impact
i
feel
childish
in
articl
write
in
articl
jodi
levin
write
how
do
the
helmetless
do
it
um
the
same
way
peopl
do
it
on
horseback
not
a
fast
and
they
would
probabl
enjoy
eat
bug
anyway
everi
bit
a
fast
a
a
dirtbik
in
the
right
terrain
and
we
eat
fli
thank
you
who
mention
dirtbik
were
talk
highway
speed
here
if
you
go
mph
on
your
dirtbik
then
feel
free
to
contribut
jeep
your
suppos
to
keep
the
windscreen
up
then
whi
doe
it
go
down
becaus
it
wouldnt
be
a
jeep
if
it
didnt
a
friend
of
mine
just
bought
one
and
it
ha
more
warn
sticker
than
those
littl
wheeler
i
guess
that
becuas
it
a
big
wheeler
anyway
it
written
in
about
ten
place
that
the
windshield
should
remain
up
at
all
time
and
it
look
like
theyv
made
it
a
pain
to
put
it
down
anyway
from
what
he
say
to
be
fair
i
do
admit
that
it
would
be
a
similar
matter
to
drive
a
windscreenless
jeep
on
the
highway
a
for
biker
they
may
particip
in
thi
discuss
but
theyr
probabl
few
and
far
between
so
i
maintain
that
thi
topic
is
of
interest
primarili
to
biker
snow
ski
no
bug
and
most
poepl
who
go
fast
wear
goggl
so
do
most
helmetless
motorcyclist
notic
how
ed
pick
on
the
more
insignific
the
lower
case
part
of
the
two
part
of
the
statement
besid
around
here
it
is
quit
rare
to
see
biker
wear
goggl
on
the
street
it
either
full
face
with
shield
or
open
face
with
either
noth
or
aviat
sunglass
my
experi
of
bicycl
with
contact
len
and
sunglass
say
that
nonwraparound
sunglass
do
almost
noth
to
keep
the
crap
out
of
one
eye
the
question
still
stand
how
do
cruiser
rider
with
no
or
neglig
helmet
stand
be
on
the
highway
at
mph
on
buggi
summer
even
helmetless
goggleless
ok
ok
fine
whatev
you
say
but
let
make
some
attmept
to
stick
to
the
point
ive
been
out
on
the
road
where
i
had
to
stop
everi
half
hour
to
clean
my
shield
there
were
so
mani
bug
and
my
jacket
would
be
a
bloodsplatt
mess
and
id
see
guy
with
shorti
helmet
no
goggl
long
beard
and
tight
tshirt
merrili
cruis
along
on
bike
with
no
windscreen
let
be
realli
specif
thi
time
so
that
even
ed
understand
doe
anbodi
think
that
splatter
bug
with
one
face
is
fun
or
are
there
other
reason
to
do
it
imag
lazi
to
make
a
point
about
freedom
of
bug
splatter
ive
bike
like
