i
am
say
is
that
you
dont
even
need
to
tell
peopl
mjsthe
techniqu
of
counterst
co
they
will
do
it
intuit
the
first
mjstime
they
tri
to
go

a
corner

you
sure
rememb
that
you
can
get
around
corner
without
karrcounterst
in
fact
my
experienc
rider
cours
instructor
karrclaim
that
they
could
get
on
behind
a
new
rider
and
make
the
bike
karrturn
to
whichev
side
they
want
just
by
shift
their
weight
karraround
even
when
the
oper
wa
tri
to
turn
in
the
opposit
karrdirect
i
admit
ive
never
actual
seen
thi
ive
experienc
thi
back
when
i
wa
younger
and
more
foolish
my
first
bike
use
to
track
extrem
true
go
down
the
highway
i
would
set
the
throttl
tension
screw
up
enough
to
hold
the
ga
steadi
slide
back
on
the
seat
and
lean
against
the
backrest
ride
without
ani
hand
if
i
need
to
turn
id
shift
my
weight
into
the
turn
and
lo
and
behold
the
bike
would
turn
san
touch
the
bar
grant
it
wouldnt
turn
veri
fast
but
it
prof
that
you
can
turn
a
bike
without
counterst
at
least
not
in
term
of
the
input
to
the
bar
normal
associ
with
counterst
a
ive
said
i
know
mani
peopl
who
think
all
you
do
is
lean
and
ani
input
theyr
give
to
the
bar
is
total
unconsci
wherea
that
may
be
suffici
to
get
you
down
the
road
under
normal
circumst
possibl
for
year
at
a
stretch
i
cant
think
of
anybodi
whod
argu
that
thi
is
prefer
to
properli
know
how
to
manipul
the
bar
in
a
turn
regardless
of
what
you
want
to
call
