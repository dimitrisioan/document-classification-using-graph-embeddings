resist
even
the
inhabit
of
the
villag
do
not
know
who
these
are
they
are
secret
about
it
but
most
peopl
often
suspect
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
up
to
these
young
men
are
support
financi
by

most
of
the
time
they
sneak
arm
and
ammunit
into
the

where
they
set

a

hideout
where
an

just
happen
to

some
of

and
your
might

are
a
you
describ
not
all
are
there
are
a

in

back
by
variou
organ
with
a
wide

of
purpos
hizbollah
and
amal
were
two
of
the
larger
one
and
may
still
be
a

that
is
still
a
far
cri
from
indiscrimin
bomb
which
would
have
produc
major
casualti
israel
retalli
polici
is
cold
heart
but
a
realiti
that
we
have
come
to
accept
and
deal
with
the
lebanes
resist
on
the
other
hand
is
not
go
to
stop
it
attack
on
occupi
isra
soldier
until
they
withdraw
thi
is
the
onli
real
leverag
that
they
have
to
forc
israel
to
withdraw
well
here
we
disagre
i
think
that
israel
would
willingli
withdraw
if
the
lebanes
govt
wa
abl
to
field
a
reliabl
forc
in
the
area
to
polic
it
and
prevent
further
attack
thi
is
the
onli
realist
solut
it
is
time
for
israel
to
realiz
that
the
concept
of
a
buffer
zone
aim
at
protect
it
northern
citi
ha
fail
in
fact
it
ha
caus
much
more
isra
death
than
the
occasion
shell
of
northern
israel
would
have
result
in
actual
that
is
not
clear
at
all
i
will
agre
that
the
death
toll
is
no
longer
civilian
and
now
primarili
militari
though
there
seem
to
be
veri
littl
incent
for
the
syrian
and
lebanes
goovern
to
allow
hizbollah
to
bomb
israel
proper
under
such
circumst
and
now
the
lebanes
govern
ha
proven
that
it
is
capabl
of
control
and
disarm
all
militia
a
they
did
in
all
other
part

no
the
