tim
clock
write
are
you
suggest
that
when
guerilla
use
the
popul
for
cover
israel
should
total
back
down
soth
easiest
way
to
get
away
with
attack
anoth
is
to
use
an
innoc
a
a
shield
and
hope
that
the
other
respect
innoc
life
tell
me
tim
what
are
these
guerilla
do
wrong
assum
that
they
are
use
civilian
for
cover
assum
also
come
on
brad
if
we
are
go
to
get
anywher
in
thi
or
ani
discuss
it
doesnt
help
to
bring
up
element
i
never
address
nor
comment
on
in
ani
way
i
made
no
comment
on
who
is
right
or
who
is
wrong
onli
that
civilian
are
be
use
a
cover
and
that
have
been
place
in
between
the
isra
and
the
guerilla
they
will
be
injur
a
both
parti
continu
their
fight
pardon
me
tim
but
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
possibl
for
the
idf
to
fail
to
detect
the
presenc
of
those
respons
for
plant
the
bomb
which
kill
the
three
idf
troop
and
then
later
know
the
exact
number
and
whereabout
of
all
of
them
sever
villag
were
shell
how
could
the
idf
possibl
have
known
that
there
were
guerrilla
in
each
of
the
target
villag
you
see
it
wa
an
arbitrari
act
of
retali
if
the
buffer
zone
is
to
prevent
attack
on
israel
is
it
not
work
whi
is
it
further
neccessari
for
isra
gun
to
pound
lebanes
villag
whi
not
just
kill
those
who
tri
to
infiltr
the
buffer
zone
you
see
there
is
more
to
the
shell
of
the
villag
it
is
call
retali
get
backget
even
it
doesnt
make
sens
to
shell
the
villag
the
least
it
show
is
a
reckless
disregard
by
the
isra
govern
for
the
life
of
civilian
i
agre
with
you
here
i
have
alway
thought
that
israel
bomb
sorte
and
bomb
polici
is
stupid
thoughtless
inhuman
and
ineffect
but
there
is
no
reason
that
israel
should
passiv
wait
until
attack
chose
to
act
there
is
everi
reason
to
believ
that
take
the
fight
to
the
enemi
will
do
more
to
stop
attack
a
i
said
previous
israel
spent
sever
decad
sit
passiv
on
it
side
of
a
border
and
onli
act
to
stop
these
attack
after
the
attack
had
enter
isra
territori
it
didnt
work
veri
well
the
host
arab
state
did
littlenoth
to
tri
and
stop
these
attack
from
it
side
of
the
border
with
israel
so
the
number
of
attack
were
consider
higher
a
wa
their
physic
and
psycholog
impact
on
the
civilian
caught
in
their
path
the
problem
tim
is
that
the
origin
reason
for
the
invas
wa
palestinian
attack
on
israel
not
lebanes
attack
whatso
the
whole
bit
about
attack
on
israel
from
neighbor
arab
state
can
start
all
over
again
while
i
also
hope
for
thi
to
happen
it
will
onli
occur
when
arab
state
show
that
they
are
prepar
to
take
on
the
respons
and
the
duti
to
stop
guerilla
attack
on
israel
from
their
soil
they
have
to
prove
it
or
provid
some
guarate
there
is
no
way
israel
is
go
to
accept
their
word
not
with
their
past
attitud
of
toler
toward
antiisrael
guerilla
inresid
if
israel
is
not
will
to
accept
the
word
of
other
then
imho
it
ha
no
busi
wast
other
time
come
to
the
peac
talk
thi
is
just
anoth
select
appli
statement
the
reason
for
thi
drawnout
impass
between
ababspalestinian
and
isra
is
that
neither
side
is
will
to
accept
the
word
of
the
other
by
your
criterion
everyon
should
stay
away
from
the
negoti
that
is
precis
whi
the
palestinian
in
their
recent
pisga
propos
for
the
interim
period
after
negoti
and
lead
up
to
full
autonomi
are
demand
condit
that
essenti
defin
autonomi
alreadi
they
do
not
trust
that
israel
will
follow
through
the
entir
process
and
allow
palestinian
to
reach
full
autonomi
do
you
understand
and
accept
thi
viewpoint
by
the
palestinian
if
you
do
then
whi
should
israel
view
of
arabspalestinian
be
ani
differ
whi
should
they
trust
the
arabpalestinian
word
sinc
they
dont
they
are
veri
reluct
to
give
up
tangibl
asset
land
control
of
area
in
exchang
for
word
for
thi
reason
they
are
also
concern
about
the
sort
of
guarante
they
will
have
that
the
arab
will
follow
through
on
their
part
of
ani
agreement
reach
first
i
believ
that
my
statement
appli
to
both
side
have
said
that
i
think
it
is
neccessari
to
separ
what
is
legitim
negoti
and
what
is
not
for
exampl
no
countri
ha
the
right
to
abus
one
human
right
decid
whether
there
will
be
one
or
two
state
in
palestin
is
a
legitim
question
while
de
facto
one
state
exist
israel
must
treat
all
within
it
domain
equit
tim
you
are
ignor
the
fact
that
the
palestinian
in
lebanon
have
been

hezbollah
remain
the
onli
independ
militia
hezbollah
doe
not
attack
israel
except
at
a

such
a
when
the

burn
up
sheikh
mosavi

while
the
major
armament
those
allow
peopl
to
wage
civil
war
have
been
remov

a
refin
disregard
for

your
of
that
of
other
such
attack
also
continu
ye
i
am
afraid
that
what
you
say
is
true
but
that
still
doe
not
justifi
occupi
your
neighbor
land
israel
must
resolv
it
disput
with
the
nativ
palestinian
if
it
want
peac
from
such
attack
of
cours
if
israel
would
withdraw
from
lebanon
and
stop
assassin
peopl
and
shell
villag
they
wouldnt
make
the
lebanes
so
mad
a
to
do
that
bat
guano
the
situat
you
call
for
exist
in
the

were
commonplac
not
true
lebanes
were
not

israel
in
the
s
with
a
strong
lebanes
govern
free
from

i
believ
that

could
be

patrol
the
palestinian

i
do
not

pleas
tim
dont
fall
into
the
trap
of
treat
lebanes
and
palestinian
a
all
part
of
the

group
there
are
too
mani
who
think
all
arab
or
all
muslim
are

i
have
seen
