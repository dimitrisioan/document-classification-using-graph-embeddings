told
becaus
there
wa
just
no

peopl
they
stop
the

but
i
heard
that

a
pile
so
a
to
burn
them
later
it
wa
hard
to
discern
from
the
corp
well
you
cant
call
them
corp
you
had
to
figur
out
from
the
ash
who
it
wa
l
heard
that
two
fellow
save
two
woman
one
a
student
ira
g
if
im
not
mistaken
she
wa
in
the
hospit
a
long
time
after
that
and
she
still
cant
figur
out
who
save
her
she
wa
also
brutal
rape
and
beaten
and
thrown
onto
a
pile
of
corp
the
fellow
pull

her
appar
well
a

rememb
everyth
well
see
the
face
hear
the
voic
two
peopl
were
say
they
could
burn
the
apart
anoth
say
whi
burn
the
apart
when
ive
got
three
kid
and
no
place
to
live
so
thi
guy
wa
in
temporari
hous
he
didnt
have
anywher
to
live
he
wa
from
sumgait
they
were
sure
that
they
would
get
the
apart
besid
the
neighbor
were
azerbaijani
whi
should
they
burn
the
apart
they
might
burn
azerbaijani
that
what
they
said
how
did
they
know
there
were
azerbaijani
there
if
they
just
pick
a
place
think
that
armenian
live
there
we
have
a
list
of
the
resid
for
our
part
of
the
build
our
name
is
in
there
but
how
could
they
know
that
azerbaijani
live
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
from
u
so
they
didnt
set
fire
to
our
apart
i
dont
know
i
wa
in
such
bad
shape
that
if
all
of
it
had
come
to
a
halt
when
i
wa
outsid
if
someon
had
ask
me
what
wa
happen
i
would
have
said
that
a
civil
war
wa
go
on
well
mayb
not
civil
but
probabl
civil
becaus
when
they
were
beat
me
i
open
my
eye
and
saw
that
all
the
neighbor
were
stand
on
their
balconi
and
watch
like
at
a
free
horror
film
so
a
civil
war
wa
go
on
and
onli
the
armenian
were
be
fought
if
it
were
a
world
war
or
someth
like
that
they
would
have
been
fight
everyon
but
they
onli
fought
u
then
i
met
some
woman
from
our
build
some
azerbaijani
they
are
cri
they
tell
me
karina
we
saw
all
of
it
how
could
it
happen
theyr
ask
me

i
just
dont
know
what
to
call
it
if
a
normal
girl
can
stand
there
and
watch
what
happen
to
me
i
think
that
if
it
were
the
other
way
around
either
i
wouldnt
have
been
abl
to
take
it
or
i
would
have
tri
to
avert
it
like
that
one
azerbaijani
woman
did
in
front
of
our
build
a
woman
live
there
an
aw
dissip
woman
if
you
can
call
her
a
woman
the
dissip
life
she
lead
two
armenian
famili
live
there
in
her
part
of
the
build
she
came
out
on
the
balconi
and
saw
what
wa
happen
to
me
and
start
to
scream
and
cur
she
came
down
to
the
entryway
