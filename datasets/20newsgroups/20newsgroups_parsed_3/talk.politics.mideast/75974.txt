the
real
question
is
whowhat
start
the
war
doe
anyon
have
ani
doubt
it
wa
the
creation
of
israel
on
arab
land
huh
a
war
wa
start
when
sever
armi
invad
israel
vow
to
drive
the
jew
into
the
sea
most
jew
want
to
live
in
peac
and
the
arab
who
stay
in
israel
were
grant
citizenship
i
am
surpris
that
you
dont
consid
the
acquisit
of
land
by
the
jew
from
arab
for
the
purpos
of
establish
an
exclus
state
a
a
hostil
action
lead
to
war
it
wa
for
the
purpos
of
establish
a
state
not
an
exclus
state
if
the
state
wa
to
be
exclus
it
would
not
have
arab
citizen
and
no
i
do
not
consid
the
purchas
of
land
a
hostil
action
when
someon
want
to
buy
land
and
someon
el
is
will
to
sell
it
at
a
mutual
agreeabl
price
then
that
is
commerc
it
is
not
a
hostil
action
lead
to
war
a
to
whether
the
jew
want
to
live
in
peac
mayb
howev
they
want
and
still
want
an
exclus
jewish
state
where
jew
are
in
control
and
jew
are
the
master
of
the
land
live
in
peac
is
meaningless
unless
it
mean
live
with
someon
el
a
equal
for
a
nativ
arab
thi
doe
not
leav
mani
option
oh
you
mean
like
both
jew
and
arab
be
citizen
the
arab
who
stay
are
now
citizen
with
a
much
right
to
choos
who
they
vote
for
a
the
jew
those
palestinian
who
stay
actual
stay
despit
of
what
happen
and
their
number
wa
somewhat
toler
a
a
defenseless
and
ineffect
minor
if
i
were
wrong
youd
have
israel
recal
all
the
palestinian
refuge
were
talk
million
after
all
they
are
civilian
huh
the
peopl
who
left
did
so
voluntarili
there
is
no
reason
for
israel
to
let
them
in
israel
gave
citizenship
to
the
remain
arab
becaus
it
had
to
maintain
a
democrat
facad
to
keep
the
western
aid
flow
israel
got
no
western
aid
in
nor
in
or
it
still
grant
citizenship
to
those
arab
who
remain
and
how
is
grant
citizenship
a
facad
tell
me
someth
sam
what
make
land
arab
how
shall
i
explain
it
a
contract
between
the
man
and
the
land
control
isnt
it
the
ottoman
rule
year
and
then
left
with
bare
a
trace
the
concept
of
land
ident
is
somewhat
foreign
to
the
mobil
and
pragmat
west
it
is
partli
the
concept
of
le
sol
natal
nativ
soil
i
know
that
jew
had
previou
histori
in
the
region
but
none
in
recent
memori
im
talk
everyday
life
not
archeolog
tri
again
you
tell
me
what
it
isnt
but
you
fail
to
establish
what
it
is
also
jew
did
have
histori
in
israel
for
over
a
thousand
year
there
were
lot
of
