i
have
no
particular
desir
to
post

yet
again
brendan
normal
you
appar
think
you
are
some
sort
of
oneman
judg
and
juri
who
so
what
are
you
can
declar
total
victori
and
then
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
applaus
but
youv
pick
the
wrong
topic
if
you
think
a
few
rig
quotat
can
sustain
the
legend
and
lie
of
the
deir
yassin
massacr
i
dont
think
that
you
are
just
make
nois
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
when
it
come
to
histor
methodolog
that
true
i
tri
to
learn
from
peopl
who
know
more
than
me
not
from
useless
fart
at
the
most
basic
level
you
should
know
that
there
is
a
big
differ
between
weigh
evid
fairli
and
mere
find
quotat
that
support
your
preset
opinion
of

i
have
said
that
more
time
in
thi
group
than
anyon
els
id
think
if

studi
the
histori
of
israel
at
all
you
must
know
that
mani
of
the
sourc
of
your
quotat
have
an
axe

and
therefor
you
must
be
veri
care
about
whom
you
quot
for
quit
true
that
whi
i
am
so
care
in
select
quot
exampl
meir
pail
whom
you
cite
wa
inde
a
gener
a
scholar
and
a
war
hero
but
that
doesnt
mean
everyth
that
come
out
of
hi
mouth
is
gold
in
fact
and
here
your
lack
of
experi
show
pail
is
such
a
fanat
embitt
leftist
that
much
of

prove

it
antiisrael
blather
forget
about

be
consid
someth
like
treason
in

of
cours
you
dont
consid
thi
at
all
when
you
find
a
juici
quotat
that
you
can
use

you
will
see
hi
indict

the
feel

i
got
rather
opposit
feel
about

though
they
have
to
make

up
it
must
sound
spici
even
some

perhap
you
would
explain
