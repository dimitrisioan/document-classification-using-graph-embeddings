it
depend
entir
on
how
you
defin
war
the
actual
fight
larg
predat
the
arab
invas
after
all
deir
yassin
happen
in
midapril
well
befor
the
arab
invas
how
do
you
defin
war
do
seig
and
constant
attack
on
villiag
count
a
act
of
war
or
is
that
onli
when
the
jew
do
them
i
would
hope
that
if
you
intend
to
have
a
reason
discus
you
might
wait
until
i
express
an
opinion
befor
decid
i
should
be
flame
for
it
a
for
war
i
am
not
sure
how
i
would
defin
it
if
you
just
look
at
attack
on
villag
then
there
is
no
way
of
decid
when
it
start
would
you
count
the
riot
in
the
s
and
s
violenc
but
not
war
i
person
think
that
war
a
oppos
to
civil
disturb
or
whatev
requir
organis
plan
and
some
measur
of
regualr
or
semiregular
forc
perhap
the
arab
liber
armi
count
i
could
easili
be
convinc
it
wa
so
from
what
i
know
they
did
not
have
a
great
deal
of
plan
let
alon
organis
the
haganah
and
palmach
certainli
did
that
is
not
a
caus
for
critic
it
mere
reflect
the
great
organis
gener
in
the
zionist
camp
of
cours
thi
isnt
war
sinc
it
onli
the
arab
attack
now
you
are
be
silli
arent
you
in
ani
case
the
war
did
not
start
with
the
invas
of
the
arab
armi
you
see
we
both
agre
on
someth
and
the
previou
poster
were
wrong
no
just
like
last
week
when
the
fatah
launch
katyusha
rocket
against
northern
israel
where
doe
upris
end
and
war
begin
again
i
am
not
sure
i
doubt
you
want
my
opinion
anyway
but
i
think
war
requir
organis
a
i
said
befor
it
need
a
group
to
command
and
plan
if
fatah
lauch
rocket
from
southern
lebanon
and
are
you
sure
you
have
the
right
group
not
the
moslem
again
then
that
sound
like
war
to
me
stone
throw
