in
order
to
let
you
get
into
the
um
well
debat
again
i
didnot

clling
too
unless
you

yourself
deserveless
master
of

write
in
hasan
flax
hasan
in
case
you
didnot
know
palestinean
were
there
for
month
and
they
are
come
back
when
you
agre
to
give
palestinean
their
humanright
afteral
human
right
arenot
negoti
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
isnt
the
right
to
one
life
also
a
human
right
or
doe
it
onli
appli
to
palestinian
no
it
is
everybodi
right
howev
when
a
killer
kill
then
he
is
give
up
willingli
or
unwillingli
hi
life
right
to
the
societi
the
societi
repres
by
the
gover
would
exercis
it
duti
by
depriv
the
killer
off
hi
life
right
so
then
it
all
right
for
israel
to
kill
the
peopl
who
kill
isra
the
old
eye
for
an
eye
think
funni
i
thought
modern
legal
system
were
made
to
counter
exactli
that
so
what
do
you
expect
me
to
tell
you
to
tell
you
master
of
wsidom
if
you
insist
on
give
me
namestitl
i
did
not
ask
for
you
could
at
least
spell
them
correctli
sigh
that
wa
onli
to
confus
you
ha
ha
ha
hey
when
you
are
intent
neglect
the
most
import
fact
that
the
whole
isra
presenc
in
the
occupi
territori
is
illegitim
and
henc
all
their
action
their
court
their
law
are
illegitim
on
the
ground
of
occupi
territori
no
i
am
not
neglect
that
im
mere
ask
you
whether
the
exist
of
isra
citicen
in
the
wb
or
in
gaza
invalid
those
individu
right
are
you
tri
to
retali
and
confus
me
here
to
live
a
a
you
so
eloqu
put
it
human
right
we
can
get
back
to
the
question
of
which
law
should
be
use
in
the
territori
later
also
you
have
not
adress
my
question
if
the
isra
also
have
human
right
first
my
abov
statement
doesnot
say
that
the
exist
of
isra
citizen
in
the
wb
revok
their
right
of
life
but
it
say
the
isra
occup
of
the
wb
revok
the
right
of
life
for
somemost
it
citizen
basic
revok
the
right
of
for
it
militari
men
clearli
occup
is
an
undeclar
war
dure
war
attack
against
militari
target
are
fulli
legitim
secondli
sure
isra
have
human
right
but
they
ask
their
gover
to
protect
it
by
withdraw
from
the
occupi
terretori
not
by
further
oppress
palestinean
human
right
what
do
you
expect
me
to
tell
you
master
of
wisdom
when
i
did
explain
my
point
in
the
post
that
you
respond
to
the
point
is
that
sinc
israel
is
occupi
then
it
is
automat
depriv
itself
from
some
of
it
right
to
the
occupi
palestinean
which
is
exactli
similar
the
automat
depriv
of
a
killer
from
hi
right
of
life
to
the
societi
if
a
state
can
depriv
all
it
citizen
of
human
right
by
it
action
then
tell
me
whi
ani
human
live
today
should
have
ani
right
at
all
becaus
not
all
state
are
like
israel
a
oppress
a
ignor
or
a
tyrant
what
kind
of
right
and
how
much
would
be
depriv
is
anoth
issu
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
a
certain
system
such
a
intern
law
u
law
isra
law
delet
jona
wa
throw
upnot
for
real
so
you
can
stick
to
the
screen
it
seem
that
the
u
law
repres
by
u
state
dept
in
thi
case
is
look
to
the
other
way
around
when
violenc
occur
in
occupi
territori
anyway
a
for
hama
then
obvious
they
turn
to
the
islam
system
and
which
system
do
you
propos
we
use
to
solv
the
me
problem
the
question
is
not
which
system
would
solv
the
me
problem
whi
becaus
ani
system
can
solv
it
the
law
of
minist
sharon
say
kick
palestinean
out
of
here
all
palestin
i
ask
for
which
system
should
be
use
that
will
preserv
human
right
for
all
peopl
involv
i
assum
that
wa
obviou
but
i
wont
repeat
that
mistak
now
that
i
have
straighten
that
out
im
eagerli
await
your
repli
so
you
agre
that
that
an
isra
solut
wouldnot
preserv
human
right
i
am
understand
thi
from
your
first
statement
in
thi
paragraph
joseph
weitz
administr
respons
for
jewish
colon
said
it
best
when
write
in
hi
diari
in
between
ourselv
it
must
be
clear
that
there
is
no
room
for
both
peopl
togeth
in
thi
countri
we
shall
not
achiev
our
goal
of
be
an
independ
peopl
with
the
arab
in
thi
small
countri
the
onli
solut
is
a
palestin
at
least
western
palestin
west
of
the
jordan
river
without
arab
and
there
is
no
other
way
than
to
transfer
the
arab
from
here
to
the
neighbour
countri
to
transfer
all
of
them
not
one
villag
not
one
tribe
should
be
left
onli
after
thi
transfer
will
the
countri
be
abl
to
absorb
the
million
of
our
own
brother
there
is
no
other
way
out
davar
septemb
courtesi
of
marc
afifi
just
a
question
if
we
are
to
disregard
the
rather
obviou
refer
to
get
israel
out
of
me
one
way
or
the
other
in
both
plo
coven
and
hama
charter
that
the
english
translat
if
you
have
other
inform
id
be
interest
to
have
you
translat
it
whi
should
we
give
ani
credenc
to
a
privat
paper
even
older
im
not
go
to
get
into
the
question
if
he
wrote
the
abov
but
it
fairli
obviou
all
parti
in
the
conflict
have
their
share
of
fanat
guess
what
those
are
not
the
peopl
that
will
make
ani
last
peac
in
the
region
more
delet
stuff
exactli
you
are
right
i
guess
that
the
problem
is
that
the
isra
gover
is
full
with
men
like
joseph
weitz
we
and
our
either
refer
to
zionist
or
jew
i
donot
know
which
well
i
can
give
you
an
answer
you
master
of
wisdom
i
will
not
suggest
the
imperialist
isra
system
for
solv
the
me
problem
i
think
that
is
fair
enough
no
that
is
not
an
answer
sinc
i
ask
for
a
system
that
could
solv
the
problem
you
said
ani
could
be
use
then
you
provid
a
contradict
abov
you
wrote
that
you
understood
what
i
meant
underlin
by
ani
system
can
be
use
to
solv
the
conflict
but
not
ani
system
would
resolv
it
justli
guess
where
that
take
your
logic
to
nevernev
land
you
are
prove
yourself
a
a
first
you
understood
what
i
meant
but
then
you
claim
you
didnot
so
to
claim
a
contradict
in
my
logic
too
bad
for
you
the
master
of
wisdom
the
greatest
problem
of
zionism
is
arab
child
rabbi
shoham
oh
and
by
the
way
let
me
add
that
these
cute
quot
you
put
at
the
end
are
a
real
bummer
when
i
tri
give
your
post
ani
credit
whi
do
you
feel
asham
by
thing
and
fact
that
you
believ
in
if
you
were
a
zionist
if
you
believ
in
zionist
code
and
act
well
i
feel
sorri
for
you
becaus
the
same
rabbi
shoham
had
said
ye
zionism
is
racism
if
you
feel
asham
and
bother
by
the
zionist
code
then
drop
zionism
if
you
are
not
zionist
whi
are
you
bother
then
you
should
join
me
in
condemn
these
racist
zionist
code
and
act
