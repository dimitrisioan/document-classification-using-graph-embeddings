you
armenia
doesnt
need
anyon
to
drag
her
into
the
conflict
it
bm
is
a
part
of
it
henrik
armenian
knew
from
the
begin
that
turk
were
fulli
engag
henrik
train
azeri
militarili
to
fight
against
karabakhiarmenian
so
should
i
at
thi
point
break
into
cap
and
start
talk
about
defens
etc
i
dont
know
how
fulli
engag
turkey
iswa
though
henrik
the
karabakhiarmenian
who
have
live
in
their
homeland
for
henrik
year
cut
off
from

and
given
to
azeri
by
stalin

conflict
they
are
defend
henrik
themselv
against
azeri
aggress
bm
huh
you
didnt
expect
azeri
to
be
friendli
to
forc
fight
with
them
bm
within
their
border
henrik
well
histori
is
sad
rememb
those
are
reloc
azeri
into
henrik
the
armenian
land
of
karabakh
by
the
stalin
regim
so
i
hear
thi
justifi
bloodsh
n
year
after
the
fact
henrik
at
last
i
hope
that
the
u
insist
that
turkey
stay
out
of
the
henrik
karabakh
crisi
so
that
the
repeat
of
the
cypru
invas
will
never
henrik
occur
again
bm
your
not
play
with
a
full
deck
are
you
where
would
turkey
invad
henrik
it
is
not
up
to
me
to
specul
but
i
am
sure
turkey
would
have
step
henrik
into
armenia
if
she
could
whi
would
turkey
do
that
do
you
not
realiz
that
thi
is
a
local
clash
that
turkey
never
wish
to
see
happen
turkey
ha
other
plan
for
region
like
econom
reviv
cooper
etc
good
stuff
in
other
word
id
be
happi
to
bicker
with
armenian
over
trade
barrier
and
such
on
usenet
rather
than
who
kill
whom
in
what
way
which
i
detest
do
and
wouldnt
do
bm
are
you
throw
the
cypru
buzzword
around
with
scg
in
the
header
bm
in
hope
that
the
greek
netter
will
jump
the
gun
henrik
absolut
not
i
am
mere
tri
to
emphas
that
in
mani
henrik
case
histori
repeat
itself
even
if
one
buy
into
your
implicit
premis
the
sane
thing
to
do
would
be
to
tri
not
to
provok
turkey
a
wa
done
in
if
there
been
a
democrat
govern
instead
of
a
bunch
of
idiot
in
athen
at
the
time
everybodi
would
have
stay
home
with
their
famili
i
have
no
wish
to
go
into
the
cypru
quarrel
but
i
suspect
what
ive
said
is
not
onli
accur
but
also
palat
to
all
parti
involv
bm
ye
inde
turkey
ha
the
militari
prowess
to
interven
what
she
wish
bm
she
had
howev
is
the
diplomat
power
to
stop
the
hostil
and
bring
bm
the
parti
to
the
negoti
tabl
that
hard
to
do
when
armenian
bm
are
attack
azeri
town
henrik
so
let
me
understand
in
plain
word
what
you
are
say
turkey
henrik
want
a
peac
end
to
thi
conflict
not
so
what
do
you
think
we
want
war
death
and
destruct
henrik
i
will
believ
it
when
i
see
it
no
if
you
allow
yourself
to
believ
it
you
just
might
see
it
henrik
now
a
far
a
attack
what
do
you
do
when
you
see
a
gun
point
henrikto
your
head
do
you
sit
there
and
watch
or
defend
yourseffat
chanc
thi
kind
of
childish
rhetor
doesnt
help
anth
henrik
do
you
rememb
what
azeri
did
to
the
armenian
in
baku
all
the
henrik
barberian
act
especi
against
mother
and
their
child
i
mean
henrik
burn
peopl
aliv
now
some
azeri
will
come
out
and
give
a
descript
of
similar
stuff
perpetr
by
armenian
one
should
rehash
stuff
like
thi
often
to
keep
the
hatr
aliv
right
bm
armenian
leader
are
lack
the
statesmanship
to
recogn
the
bmfutil
of
arm
conflict
and
convinc
their
nation
that
a
compromis
that
bm
lead
to
stabil
is
much
better
than
a
militari
fait
accompli
that
bm
go
to
caus
incess
skirmish
henrik
armenian
in
karabakh
want
peac
and
their
own
republ
they
are
henrik
not
ask
much
they
simpli
want
to
get
back
what
wa
taken
away
henrik
from
them
and
given
to
azeri
by
stalin
well
they
obvious
arent
get
anywher
with
their
current
method
of
ask
not
veri
peac
id
say
bm
think
of
or
year
down
the
line
both
of
the
newli
independ
bm
countri
need
to
develop
econom
and
neither
one
is
go
to
wipe
bm
the
other
out
these
peopl
will
be
neighbor
would
it
not
be
better
bm
to
keep
the
bad
blood
between
them
minim
henrik
dont
get
me
wrong
i
also
want
peac
solut
to
the
henrik
conflict
but
until
azeri
realiz
that
the
armenian
in
henrik
karabakh
will
defend
themselv
against
aggres
i
dont
know
if
you
want
a
solut
or
just
want
to
exchang
slogan
peac
isnt
what
happen
right
now
furthermor
what
happen
right
now
isnt
condus
to
peac
you
can
spend
day
and
night
rave
about
how
right
the
armenian
posit
is
and
im
sure
therel
be
other
whod
be
happi
to
talk
to
you
by
argu
the
other
side
if
entrench
posit
lead
to
war
and
if
peopl
want
peac
than
they
should
sit
down
and
talk
about
a
compromis
armenia
isnt
strong
enough
to
exercis
the
we
think
were
right
and
we
have
the
bomb
so
well
do
whatev
we
want
so
there
style
of
foreign
relat
ye
you
can
type
stalin
in
cap
and
give
one
side
atroc
stori
etc
but
for
peac
you
need
to
be
will
to
talk
to
the
other
side
you
person
can
choos
not
to
do
that
of
cours
thi
be
just
usenet
the
peopl
in
power
shouldnt
be
so
childish
bm
if
you
belong
to
the
armenian
diaspora
keep
in
mind
that
what
strike
bm
your
fanci
on
the
map
is
cost

term
of
bm
their
blood
and
futur

spew
misinform
about
a
boogeyman
you
can
also
talk
about
how
one
might
avoid
the
nasti

do
not
take

will
be
wipe
