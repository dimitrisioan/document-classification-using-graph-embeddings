said
they

i
wa
just
point
out
that
not
compromis
may
be
a
bad
idea
and
there
are
in

voic

and
i
think
there
are
mani
among

also
against

negoci
just
an

dorin
ok
i
donot
know
whi
there
are
isra
voic

howev
i
would
guess
that
is
becaus
they
refus
give
back
a
land
for
those
who
have
the
right
for
it
a
for
the
arabian
and
palestinean
voic
that
are
against
the
current
negoti
and
the
socal
peac
process
they
are
not
against
peac
per
se
but
rather
for
their
wellfound
predict
that
israel
would
not
give
an
inch
of
the
west
bank
and
most
probabl
the
same
for
golan
height
back
to
the

an

in
madrid

prove
these
predict
now
mani
will
jump

say
whi
are
you
blame
isra
for
noresult
negoti
i
would
say
whi
would
the
arab
stall
the
negoti
what
do
they
have
to
loos
arab
feel
that
the
current
negoti
is
onli
for
legitim
the
current
statusquo
and
for
open
the
door
of
the
arab
market
for
