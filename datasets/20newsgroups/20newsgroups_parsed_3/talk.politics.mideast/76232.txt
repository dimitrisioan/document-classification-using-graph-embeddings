german
kill
jew
in

but
there
wa
quit
a
differ
in
these
two
statement
regardless
of
what
nazi
revisionist
say
sy
my
grand
parent
were
live
partli
in
today
armenia
and
partli
in
sy
today
georgia
there
were
villag
kurdturk
differ
turkic
group
sy
georgian
muslimchristian
armenian
and
farsi
veri
near
to
eachoth
sy
the
peopl
live
there
were
awar
of
their
differ
they
were
sy
differ
peopl
for
exampl
my
grandfath
would
not
have
been
happi
sy
if
hi
doughter
had
will
to
marri
an
armenian
guy
but
that
did
not
sy
mean
that
they
were
will
to
kill
eachoth
no
they
were
neighbor
ok
sy
armenian
kill
turk
which
armenian
their
neoghbor
a
far
a
my
sy
grandpar
are
concern
the
armenian
attack
first
but
these
sy
armenian
were
not
their
neighbor
they
came
from
other
place
mayb
sy
first
they
had
a
train
at
some
place
they
were
taught
to
kill
peopl
sy
to
hate
turkskurd
it
seem
so
there
is
certainli
a
differ
between
the
plan
extermin
of
the
armenian
of
eastern
turkey
begin
in
with
that
of
the
armeno
georgian
conflict
of
late
the
argument
is
not
whether
armenian
ever
kill
in
their
collect
exist
but
rather
the
wholesal
destruct
of
anatolian
armenian
under
order
of
the
turkish
govern
an
armenian
georgian
disput
over
the
disposit
of
akhalkalak
lori
and
pambak
after
the
turkish
third
armi
evacu
the
region
can
not
be
equat
with
the
extermin
of
anatolian
armenian
mani
armenian
and
georgian
die
in
thi
area
in
the
scrambl
to
reoccupi
these
land
and
the
lack
of
prepar
for
the
winter
month
thi
is
not
the
same
a
the
turkish
genocid
of
the
armenian
nearli
four
year
earlier
hundr
of
kilomet
away
sy
anyway
but
after
they
killedrap
turk
and
other
muslim
peopl
sy
around
peopl
assum
that
armenian
kill
u
rape
our
woman
sy
not
a
particular
group
of
peopl
train
in
some
camp
mayb
back
sy
by
some
power
state
after
that
step
you
can
not
explain
these
sy
peopl
not
to
hate
all
armenian
i
dont
follow
perhap
the
next
paragraph
will
shed
some
light
sy
so
what
am
i
tri
to
point
out
first
at
least
for
that
region
sy
you
can
not
blame
turkskurd
etc
sinc
it
wa
a
self
defens
situat
sy
most
of
the
armenian
i
think
are
not
to
blame
either
but
sinc
some
sy
peopl
start
that
fire
it
is
not
easi
to
undo
it
there
are
fact
sy
peopl
can
not
trust
eachoth
easili
it
is
veri
difficult
to
establish
sy
a
good
relat
base
on
mutual
respect
and
trust
between
nation
with
sy
differ
ethnicculturalreligi
background
but
it
is
unfortun
sy
veri
easi
to
start
a
fire
again
the
fight
between
armenian
and
georgian
in
had
littl
to
do
with
the
destruct
of
the
armenian
in
turkey
it
is
interest
that
the
georgian
leader
of
the
transcaucasian
feder
armenia
azerbaijan
and
georgia
made
special
deal
with
turkish
gener
not
to
pa
