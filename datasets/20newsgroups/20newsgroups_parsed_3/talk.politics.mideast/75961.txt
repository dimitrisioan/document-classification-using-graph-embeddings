i
will
tri
to
answer
some
of
dorin
question
even
though
they
were
not
address
to
me
specif
but
i
feel
that
i
am
a
bit
concern
by
the
thread
sinc
i
am
a
southern
lebanes
from
a
villag
that
is
often
on
the
receiv
end
of
israel
bomb
in
the
first
place
the
death
of
three
soldier
on
a
patrol
in
occupi
lebanes
terrritori
is
not
an
act
of
terror
or
murder
it
is
disingen
to
compar
their
death
to
that
of
athlet
in
munich
or
ani
other
act
of
terror
or
mrder
thi
exercis
is
aim
sole
at
divert
the
issu
and
is
far
from
the
truth
it
seem
to
me
dorin
that
you
are
so
remot
and
ignor
of
the
problem
on
the
ground
that
your
comment
can
onli
be
charactr
a
irrelev
and
heavili
color
by
the
preconcept
and
misinform
i
will
tri
to
paint
the
most
accur
pictur
i
can
of
what
the
situat
realli
is
in
south
lebanon
in
articl
dorin
baru
write
is
there
ani
isra
a
civilian
in
your
opinion
now
i
do
not
condon
myself
bomb
villag
ani
kind
of
villag
but
you
claim
these
are
villag
with
civilian
and
ira
claim
they
are
camp
fill
with
terrorist
you
claim
that
isra
shell
the
villag
with
the
hope
of
find
a
terrorist
or
so
if
they
kill
one
fine
if
not
too
bad
civilian
die
right
i
am
not
so
sure
i
am
i
wa
back
in
my
home
villag
thi
last
summer
for
your
inform
we
are
peopl
not
a
bunch
of
indiscrimin
terrorist
most
of
the
peopl
in
my
villag
are
regular
inhabit
that
go
about
their
daili
busi
some
work
in
the
field
some
own
small
shop
other
are
older
men
that
go
to
the
coff
shop
and
drink
coffe
is
that
so
hard
to
imagin
it
is
not
a
terrorist
camp
a
you
and
the
isra
like
to
view
the
villag
they
are
small
commun
with
kid
play
soccer
in
the
street
woman
prepar
lunch
men
play
card
etc
some
young
men
usual
age
between
to
year
are
member
of
the
lebanes
resist
even
the
inhabit
of
the
villag
do
not
know
who
these
are
they
are
secret
about
it
but
most
peopl
often
suspect
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
up
to
these
young
men
are
support
financi
by
iran
most
of
the
time
they
sneak
arm
and
ammunit
into
the
occupi
zone
where
they
set
up
boobi
trap
for
isra
patrol
everi
time
an
isra
soldier
is
kill
or
injur
by
these
trap
israel
retalli
by
indiscrimin
bomb
villag
of
their
own
choos
often
kill
onli
innoc
civilian
onc
they
are
back
they
announc
that
they
bomb
a
terrorist
hideout
where
an
year
old
girl
just
happen
to
be
we
are
now
accustom
to
isra
tactic
and
we
figur
that
thi
is
the
isra
way
of
tell
u
that
if
your
gon
na
hurt
our
soldier
your
gon
na
pay
the
price
we
accept
thi
a
a
price
we
have
to
pay
to
free
our
land
israel
know
veri
well
that
it
is
not
realli
hurt
the
resist
that
much
militarili
with
these
strike
but
rather
just
keep
the
pressur
on
the
villag
to
demand
from
their
young
men
to
stop
attack
isra
soldier
sinc
these
attack
are
take
a
heavi
toll
on
the
life
of
the
civilian
villag
israel
retalli
polici
is
cold
heart
but
a
realiti
that
we
have
come
to
accept
and
deal
with
the
lebanes
resist
on
the
other
hand
is
not
go
to
stop
it
attack
on
occupi
isra
soldier
until
they
withdraw
thi
is
the
onli
real
leverag
that
they
have
to
forc
israel
to
withdraw
the
peopl
of
south
lebanon
are
occupi
or
shell
by
israel
on
a
regular
basi
we
do
not
want
to
be
occupi
if
israel
insist
that
the
so
call
secur
zone
is
necessari
for
the
protect
of
northern
israel
than
it
will
have
to
pay
the
price
of
it
occup
with
the
blood
of
it
soldier
if
israel
is
interest
in
peac
than
it
should
withdraw
from
our
land
we
are
not
ask
for
the
establish
of
a
lebanes
occupi
zone
in
northern
israel
to
protect
our
villag
that
are
attack
on
a
regular
basi
by
israel
so
the
best
polici
seem
to
be
the
remov
of
isra
occup
and
the
establish
of
peac
keep
troop
along
the
border
i
have
written
befor
on
thi
veri
newsgroup
that
the
onli
real
solut
will
come
a
a
result
of
a
comprehens
peac
settlement
wherebi
israel
withdraw
to
it
own
border
and
peac
keep
troop
are
station
along
the
border
to
insur
no
one
on
either
side
of
the
border
is
shell
thi
is
the
onli
realist
solut
it
is
time
for
israel
to
realiz
that
the
concept
of
a
buffer
zone
aim
at
protect
it
northern
citi
ha
fail
in
fact
it
ha
caus
much
more
isra
death
than
the
occasion
shell
of
northern
israel
would
have
result
in
if
israel
realli
want
to
save
some
isra
life
it
would
withdraw
unilater
from
the
socal
secur
zone
befor
the
conclus
of
the
peac
talk
such
a
move
would
save
isra
life
advanc
peac
effort
give
israel
a
great
moral
lift
better
israel
public
imag
abroad
and
give
it
an
edg
in
the
peac
negoci
sinc
israel
can
rightli
claim
that
it
is
genuin
interest
in
peac
and
ha
alreadi
offer
some
import
concess
along
with
such
a
withdraw
israel
could
demand
that
hizbollah
be
disarm
by
the
lebanes
govern
and
warn
that
it
will
not
accept
ani
attack
against
it
northern
citi
and
that
if
such
a
shell
occur
than
it
will
consid
retak
the
buffer
zone
and
will
hold
the
lebanes
and
syrian
govern
respons
for
it
there
seem
to
be
veri
littl
incent
for
the
syrian
and
lebanes
goovern
to
allow
hizbollah
to
bomb
israel
proper
under
such
circumst
and
now
the
lebanes
govern
ha
proven
that
it
is
capabl
of
control
and
disarm
all
militia
a
they
did
in
all
other
part
of
lebanon
if
you
ask
me
those
question
i
will
have
no
problem
answer
not
with
a
question
a
you
did
no
nobodi
is
qualifi
candid
for
murder
noth
justifi
murder
i
agre
onli
in
the
case
of
the
isar
soldier
their
kill
can
not
be
qualifi
a
murder
no
matter
what
you
say
i
have
the
feel
that
you
may
be
abl
yourself
to
make
similar
statement
mayb
after
elimin
all
isra
jew
am
i
wrong
ye
we
have
no
quarrel
with
jew
or
isra
civilian
the
real
problem
is
with
occupi
isra
soldier
and
those
brave
isra
pilot
that
bomb
our
civilian
villag
everi

an
