number
of
those

ibm
you
can
do
so
onli
if
you
make
your

clear
apriori
clearli
the
jew
who
purchas

they

etc
they
did
not
know
they
were
victim
of
an
intern
conspiraci
im
not
a
conspiraci
theorist
myself
but
thi
one
is
hard
to
dismiss
a
to
whether
the
jew
want
to
live
in
peac
mayb
howev
they
want
and
still
want
an
exclus
jewish
state
where
jew
are
in
control
and
jew
are
the
master
of
the
land
live
in
peac
is
meaningless
unless
it
mean
live
with
someon
els
a
equal
for
a
nativ
arab
thi
doe
not
leav

option
oh
you
mean
like
both
jew
and
arab
be
citizen
the
arab
who
stay
are
now
citizen
with
a
much
right
to
choos
who
they
vote
for
a
the
jew
again
adam
the
devil
is
in
the
detail
i
dont
want
to
get
on
a
tangent
here
but
it
the
same
reason
that
say
it
ok
to
return
deport
and
leav
the
rest
becaus
is
a
nice
number
that
you
can
devid
by
and
besid
it
ha
an
integ
squar
root
those
palestinian
who
stay
actual
stay
despit
of
what
happen
and
their
number
wa
somewhat
toler
a
a
defenseless
and
ineffect
minor
if
i
were
wrong
youd
have
israel
recal
all
the
palestinian
refuge
were
talk
million
after
all
they
are
civilian
huh
the
peopl
who
left
did
so
voluntarili
there
is
no
reason
for
israel
to
let
them
in
do
you
actual
believ
thi
my
experi
tell
me
that
everi
palestinian
i
knew
still
keep
the
key
to
hi
home
in
palestin
besid
they
often
refer
to
their
exodu
a
an
escap
from
hell
so
to
speak
i
know
none
that
agre
with
you
did
you
sampl
their
opinion
i
know
you
dont
care
just
be
rethor
israel
gave
citizenship
to
the
remain
arab
becaus
it
had
to
maintain
a
democrat
facad
to
keep
the
western
aid
flow
israel
got
no
western
aid
in
nor
in
or
it
still
grant
citizenship
to
those
arab
who
remain
and
how
is
grant
citizenship
a
facad
dont
get
me
wrong
i
beleiv
that
israel
is
democrat
within
the
constraint
of
one
domin
ethnic
group
jew
israel
probabl
had
a
few
option
after
ethnic
cleans
serbian
style
and
deserv
the
wrath
of
the
intern
commun
or
make
the
best
out
of
a
no
win
condit
show
the
world
how
good
israel
is
toward
the
bad
arab
personali
ive
never
heard
anyth
about
the
arab
commun
in
isreal
except
that
theyr
there
so
ye
theyr
there
but
a
a
commun
with
histori
and
root
it
dead
tell
me
someth
sam
what
make
land
arab
how
shall
i
explain
it
a
contract
between
the
man
and
the
land
control
isnt
it
the
ottoman
rule
year
and
then
left
with
bare
a
trace
the
concept
of
land
ident
is
somewhat
foreign
to
the
mobil
and
pragmat
west
it
is
partli
the
concept
of
le
sol
natal
nativ
soil
i
know
that
jew
had
previou
histori
in
the
region
but
none
in
recent
memori
im
talk
everyday
life
not
archeolog
tri
again
you
tell
me
what
it
isnt
but
you
fail
to
establish
what
it
is
also
jew
did
have
histori
in
israel
for
over
a
thousand
year
there
were
lot
of
jew
slaughter
by
crusad
in
israel
there
wa
a
thrive
commun
in
gaza
citi
from
roughli
jew
were
a
major
in
jerusalem
from
or
so
onward
doe
that
make
the
land
jewish
i
stand
correct
i
meant
that
the
jewish
cultur
wa
not
predomin
in
palestin
in
recent
histori
i
have
no
problem
with
jerusalem
have
a
jewish
charact
if

jewish
so
there
what
