or
en
larg
for

from
the
local

elect
at
the

the
system
wa
structur
differ
but
it
did
not
ceas
to
amaz
me
that
there
wa
no
massiv
effort
to
lobbi
for
arab
rep
by
their
own
deleg
exactli
what
basi
do
you
have
for
say
thi
when
the
labour
parti
ha
never
put
an
arab
into
a
cabinet
post
and
insist
it
coalit
member
do
the
same
whi
and
on
what
basi
are
you
reassur
me
in
the
face
of
year
of
discriminatori
practis
quit
simpli
if
all
elig
arab
voter
becam
member
of
the
labor
parti
and
vote
they
would
be
abl
to
command
more
than
of
the
deleg
thi
is
a
power
base
that
can
not
be
ignor
especi
when
they
are
not
rank
high
in
the
parti
onc
again
due
to
lack
of
polit
power
i
have
seen
how
the
labor
parti
work
from
the
insid
and
my
experi
ha
been
that
a
in
most
polit
situat
the
mk
act
out
of
their
own
selfinterest
and
to
answer
your
question
i
broke
with
labor
becaus
i
felt
that
they
were
heed
too
much
to
the
rightw
and
ultraorthodox
coalit
member
from
the
other
front
juli
translat
of
haaretz
articl
racism
in
the
knesset
thi
attitud
which
until
recent
had
not
even
arous
critic
be
so
natur
and
so
deeplyemboss
upon
peopl
heart
hold
that
there
are
knesset
member
who
despit
have
been
elect
by
ten
of
thousand
of
vote
are
not
entitl
to
be
full
partner
in
the
bodi
which
repres
the
peopl
of
israel
we
are
not
speak
here
of
polit
discrimin
which
would
be
bad
enough
in
itself
but
of
racial
discrimin
the
proof
one
of
the
compromis
propos
wa
that
mk
mahamid
an
arab
yigal
should
be
replac
by
tamar
gojanski
a
jew
yigal
from
the
same
parti
it
wa
not
the
member
parti
which
wa
consid
unfit
but
hi
race
fair
enough
my
take
on
the
matter
and
i
will
admit
to
the
possibl
that
thi
might
be
seen
differ
is
that
thi
wa
a
dummi
argument
if
he
wa
sit
on
the
committe
then
someon
el
obvious
would
not
be
in
drum
up
support
for
hi
seat
mk
would
not
be
avers
to
use
thi
argument
or
it
could
be
use
on
hi
behalf
a
to
the
proof
present
in
thi
articl
i
would
find
it
veri
interest
to
know
who
propos
the
compromis
along

the
matter
standswa
resolv
let
me
just
take
thi
opportun

that
i
deplor
such
action
and
groundless
justif
