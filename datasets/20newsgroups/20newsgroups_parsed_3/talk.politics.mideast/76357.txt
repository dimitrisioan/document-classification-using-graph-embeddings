the
onli
case
that
i
can
think
of
in
which
the
leum
field
might
be
taken
into
account
is
dure
interact
with
the
polic
base
upon
the
scenario
in
gener
though
arab
citizen
are
clearli
recogniz
a
are
nonarab
your
argument
therefor
becom
moot
unless
you
can
provid
an
exampl
of
how
thi
field
is
be
use
to
discrimin
against
them
offici
in
the
answer
to
my
second
question
concern
the
fact
that
israel
ha
no
fix
border
you
state
that
israel
border
were
shape
and
reshap
by
both
war
and
peac
accord
to
what
i
read
the
first
zionist
in
the
begin
of
the
centuri
had
plan
for
the
jewish
state
to
extend
into
what
is
lebanon
and
into
transjordan
jordan
i
also
read
that
it
wa
the
express
wish
of
bengurion
to
not
declar
israel
border
when
israel
wa
establish
a
thi
might
restrict
israel
opportun
for
later
expans
israel
often
claim
it
right
of
exist
on
the
fact
that
jew
live
there
year
ago
or
that
god
promis
the
land
to
them
but
accord
to
biblic
sourc
the
area
god
promis
would
extend
all
the
way
to
iraq
and
what
were
the
border
in
biblic
time
which
israel
consid
proper
to
use
today
final
if
israel
want
peac
whi
cant
it
declar
what
it
consid
it
legitim
and
secur
border
which
might
be
a
base
for
negoti
have
all
the
abov
fact
in
mind
one
can
not
blame
arab
countri
to
fear
isra
expansion
a
a
number
of
war
have
prove
i
take
issu
with
your
assert
i
think
that
arab
countri
do
know
that
they
have
noth
to
fear
from
isra
expansion
militarili
israel
is
not
capabl
of
hold
onto
larg
tract
of
land
under
occup
to
a
hostil
arm
and
insurg
popul
for
a
sustain
period
of
time
a
is
the
intifada
is
heavili
tax
the
isra
economi
proof
of
thi
can
be
seen
in
the
isra
withdraw
from
lebanon
isra
troop
pull
back
from
the
awali
and
later
from
the
litani
in
order
to
control
the
minim
strip
need
to
keep
town
out
of
rang
of
katyusha
missil
fire
public
opinion
in
israel
ha
turn
toward
settl
the
intifada
via
territori
concess
the
israel
public
is
suffer
from
battl
fatigu
of
sort
and
the
govt
is
awar
of
it
with
regard
to
border
let
me
state
the
follow
i
may
not
agre
with
the
manner
in
which
negoti
are
be
held
howev
the
crux
of
the
matter
is
that
everyon
either
make
or
refrain
from
state
a
start
posit
the
arab
parti
have
call
for
total
withdraw
and
a
return
to
pre
border
if
israel
were
to
state
larg
border
the
negoti
might
never
get
under
way
if
israel
were
to
state
smaller
border
then
the
arab
countri
might
tri
and
forc
even
smaller
border
dure
the
negoti
i
think
that
leav
the
matter
to
be
settl
by
negoti
and
peac
treati
is
infinit
more
realist
and
sensibl
your
answer
to
my
third
question
is
typic
of
a
stalinist
public
offici
i
dont
think
your
answer
is
honest
you
refer
me
to
vanunu
revel
about
israel
nuclear
arsen
without
evalu
the
truthful
of
hi
revel
now
if
he
said
the
truth
then
whi
should
he
been
punish
and
if
he
lie
whi
should
he
be
punish
i
would
appreci
more
honesti
your
statement
is
typic
of
the
simpl
mind
naiveti
of
a
center
for
polici
research
whether
or
not
all
of
vanunu
revel
were
true
ha
no
bear
on
the
fact
that
some
were
for
disclos
state
secret
after
have
sign
contract
and
form
with
the
understand
that
said
secret
are
not
to
be
made
public
one
should
be
punish
a
to
which
were
and
which
werent
i
am
under
no
moral
oblig
to
disclos
that
quit
the
revers
in
fact
he
wa
taken
to
court
tri
and
found
guilti
you
may
take
issu
with
a
number
of
thing
but
clearli
you
have
no
understand
of
the
concept
of
secret
of
state
someth
which
everi
democrat
govt
ha
somebodi
provid
an
answer
to
the
fourth
question
concern
hidden
prison
in
isra
prison
he
post
an
articl
from
maariv
document
such
case
it
seem
that
such
prison
do
exist
in
israel
what
do
you
think
about
that
i
notic
that
he
wa
document
the
fact
that
such
prison
could
exist
more
than
he
document
the
fact
that
they
do
exist
the
clu
note
which
you
evid
did
not
pay
attent
to
that
they
know
of
no
such
report
or
case
i
am
sorri
to
tell
you
but
in
a
countri
of
mill
a
tightli
knit
a
israel
even
if
the
matter
of
the
arrest
wa
not
made
public
within
a
rel
short
time
frame
most
peopl
would
know
about
it
my
own
feel
are
that
the
matter
of
the
arrest
should
be
made
public
unless
a
court
order
is
issu
allow
a
delay
of
x
hour
thi
would
be
grant
onli
if
a
judg
could
be
convinc
that
an
announc
would
caus
irrepar
harm
to
the
ongo
investig
you
impli
that
my
question
show
bia
and
are
formul
in
such
a
way
to
cast
asper
upon
israel
such
term
have
often
been
use
by
the
soviet
union
against
dissid
they
call
the
soviet
union
into
disreput
if
my
question
are
not
disturb
they
would
not
call
forth
such
hyster
answer
my
question
are
clearli
provoc
but
they
are
meant
to
seek
fact
i
would
be
veri
happi
if
you
could
convinc
me
that
what
i
am
told
about
israel
were
just
fabric
but
ala
you
have
fail
to
do
so
i
suspect
that
you
fear
the
truth
and
an
open
and
honest
discus
thi
is
a
sign
of
weak
not
of
strength
well
i
am
sorri
to
say
that
your
question
are
slant
such
question
are
often
term
tabloid
journal
and
are
not
disturb
becaus
they
avoid
ani
attempt
at
object
such
question
were
often
use
dure
the
mccarthi
era
a
a
basi
for
the
witchhunt
that
took
place
then
to
use
your
own
exampl
these
question
might
have
been
lift
from
the
format
use
by
stalinist
prosecutor
that
were
look
for
small
bit
of
evid
that
they
could
distort
and
portray
a
a
larger
and
dirtier
pictur
my
answer
were
not
ani
more
hyster
than
the
question
themselv
the
problem
is
not
that
the
q
were
provoc
it
wa
that
they
were
select
in
their
fact
seek
you
fall
into
the
same
categori
of
those
who
seek
ye
no
answer
when
the
real
answer
is
of
sort
i
suspect
that
a
long
a
the
answer
to
these
question
is
not
an
unequivoc
no
you
would
remain
unsatifi
and
choos
to
interpret
them
a
you
see
fit
a
sign
of
strength
is
the
abil
to
look
you
remind
me
of
those
mistaken
environmentalist
who
onc
advoc
cull
wolv
becaus
of
the
cruelti
to
deer
onli
to
find
that
they
had
broken
the
food
chain
and
wreak
havoc
upon
the
veri
environ
they
sought
to
protect
the
color
blind
you
exhibit
is
a
true
sign
of
weak
i
hope
you
will
muster
the
courag
to
seek
