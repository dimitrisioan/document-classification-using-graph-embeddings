my
argument
to

that
the

it
is
a

it

that
defend

nobl
noth

with

it
is
a

whose

at

consist
defend
the

which
again
is
entir
appropri
and
it
is
a

that
maintain
an

arrang
with

enforc
again
there
is
noth
wrong
for
a
group
to
do
that
but
you
cant
do
all
four
it
is
imposs
to
do
all
four
and
not
violat

there
