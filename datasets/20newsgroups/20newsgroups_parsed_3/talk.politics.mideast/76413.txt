write
i
would
like
to
share
with
netter
a
few
point
i
pick
up
from
the
pb
frontlin
program
regard
iran
nuclear
activ
air
on
tuesday
april
for
the
sake
of
breviti
ill
present
them
in
some
separ
point
alreadi
say
it
the
other
week
on
cbc
snoozeworld
a
mani
other
western
program
thi
program
wa
laid
on
a
bed
of
misinform
throughout
the
program
to
maxim
the
effect
of
the
program
on
the
viewer
some
of
the
misinform
were
a
follow
yeah
i
thought
bonanza
wa
full
of
lie
about
the
west
while
the
number
of
martyr
dure
the
sacr
defens
against
iraqi
aggress
ha
been
offici
announc
to
be
about
and
even
most
radic
counterrevolutionari
group
claim
that
iran
and
iraq
had
a
total
of
one
million
dead
thi
program
claim
that
iran
alon
ha
one
million
dead
left
from
the
war
the
translat
of
iranian
offici
talk
are
not
true
for
exampl
when
iranian
head
of
atom
energi
say
that
it
hurt
me
to
see
that
iran
is
the
subject
of
these
unfriendli
propaganda
the
translat
say
it
hurt
to
see
that
iran
is
do
unfriendli
research
almost
all
alleg
devic
or
materi
bought
or
plan
to
be
bought
by
iranian
were
of
countless
dual
usag
while
the
program
tri
to
undermin
their
nonmilitari
use
without
ani
refer
to
iran
big
popul
and
it
inevit
need
to
other
sourc
of
energi
in
near
futur
and
it
current
deficit
in
electr
power
whi
the
hell
would
such
an
oil
rich
and
hydroelectr
potenti
to
be
exploit
spend
billion
on
a
nuclear
energi
programm
the
whole
program
is
tri
to
show
the
sharif
univers
of
technolog
a
a
nuclear
research
center
while
even
the
cameraman
of
the
program
know
well
that
in
a
countri
like
iran
without
a
so
tightli
close
societi
no
one
can
make
a
nuclear
bomb
in
a
univers
take
in
account
the
scientif
advanc
of
sharif
u
in
engin
field
and
it
potenti
role
in
improv
of
iran
industri
and
eventu
the
live
of
peopl
it
is
obviou
that
they
are
persuad
other
countri
to
prevent
them
from
further
help
thi
univers
or
other
one
in
scientif
and
industri
effort
a
key
point
in
program
justif
is
tri
to
disvalid
a
much
a
possibl
all
effort
done
by
iaea
in
their
numer
visit
from
iran
differ
site
they
say
we
are
not
sure
if
the
place
visit
by
iaea
are
the
real
one
or
not
or
we
can
not
reli
on
iaea
report
and
observ
becaus
they
fail
to
see
iraq
nuclear
activ
befor
a
if
they
didnt
know
that
iraq
wa
tri
to
build
nuclear
weapon
yeah
and
we
have
everi
reason
in
the
world
to
trust
the
iranian
regim
after
all
theyv
been
so
forward
with
u
in
the
past
a
an
extrem
person
opinion
the
most
disgust
aspect
of
the
program
wa
the
arrog
of
the
member
of
u
senat
foreign

william
triplet
in
hi
way
of

a
if
he
wa
the
god

i
hope
all
iranian
be
awar
of
the
gradual
buildup
against
their
countri
in
western
medium
and
i
hope
iranian
