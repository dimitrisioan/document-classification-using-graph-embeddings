post

we
have
come
to
accept
and
deal
with
the
lebanes
resist
on
the
other
hand
is
not
go
to
stop
it
attack
on
occupi
isra
soldier
until
they
withdraw
thi
is
the
onli
real
leverag
that
they
have
to
forc
israel
to
withdraw
tell
me
do
these
young
men
also
attack
syrian
troop
with
the
blood
of
it
soldier
if
israel
is
interest
in
peac
than
it
should
withdraw
from
our
land
there
must
be
a
guarante
of
peac
befor
thi
happen
it
seem
that
mani
of
these
lebanes
youth
are
unabl
to
restrain
themselv
from
violenc
and
unabl
to
to
realiz
that
their
action
prolong
israel
stay
in
south
lebanon
if
the
lebanes
armi
wa
abl
to
maintain
the
peac
then
israel
would
not
have
to
be
there
until
it
is
israel
prefer
that
it
soldier
die
rather
than
it
child
if
israel
realli
want
to
save
some
isra
live
it
would
withdraw
unilater
from
the
socal
secur
zone
befor
the
conclus
of
the
peac
talk
such
a
move
would
save
isra
live
advanc
peac
effort
give
israel
a
great
moral
lift
better
israel
public
imag
abroad
and
give
it
an
edg
in
the
peac
negoci
sinc
israel
can
rightli
claim
that
it
is
genuin
interest
in
peac
and
ha
alreadi
offer
some
import
concess
israel
should
withdraw
from
lebanon
when
a
peac
treati
is
sign
not
a
day
befor
withdraw
becaus
of
casualti
would
tell
the
lebanes
peopl
that
all
they
need
to
do
to
push
israel
around
is
kill
a
few
soldier
it
not
gon
na
happen
along
with
such
a
withdraw
israel
could
demand
that
hizbollah
be
disarm
by
the
lebanes
govern
and
warn
that
it
will
not
accept
ani
attack
against
it
northern
citi
and
that
if
such
a
shell
occur
than
it
will
consid
retak
the
buffer
zone
and
will
hold
the
lebanes
and
syrian
govern
respons
for
it
whi
should
israel
not
demand
thi
while
hold
the
buffer
zone
it
seem
to
me
that
the
better
bargain
posit
is
while
hold
your
neighbor
land
if
lebanon
were
will
to
agre
to
those
condit
israel
would
quit
probabl
have
left
alreadi
unfortun
it
doesnt
seem
that
the
lebanes
can
disarm
the
hizbolah
and
maintain
the
peac
adam

shostack
if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drug
and
sexual
favor
we
sure
wouldnt
wast
