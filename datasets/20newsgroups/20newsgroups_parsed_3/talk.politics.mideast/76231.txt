are
you
awar
that
there
is
an
arm
embargo
on
all
of
what
iswa
yugoslavia
includ
bosnia
which
guarante
massiv
militari
superior
of
serbian
forc
and
doe
not
allow
the
bosnian
to
tri
to
defend
themselv
should
we
sell
weapon
to
all
side
or
just
the
lose
one
then
end
an
embargo
doe
not
we
must
sell
anyth
at
all
right
well
probabl
end
up
give
them
weapon
if
the
european
want
to
sell
weapon
to
one
or
both
side
they
are
welcom
a
far
a
im
concern
you
seem
to
oppos
end
the
embargo
you
know
it
is
difficult
for
european
to
sell
weapon
when
there
is
an
embargo
in
place
dure
wwii
the
british
manag
to
suppli
arm
to
the
yugoslav
despit
german
occup
if
the
european
had
the
will
to
do
anyth
besid
sponsor
peac
confer
they
would
have
no
problem
put
ani
kind
of
weapon
they
want
into
bosnia
i
guess
i
would
favor
end
the
embargo
if
the
congress
would
pa
a
law
forbid
export
of
u
militari
suppli
to
yugoslavia
includ
via
third
parti
until
then
the
risk
of
the
u
be
drawn
into
a
more
activ
role
would
be
too
great
i
do
not
see
the
arm
embargo
a
a
major
factor
in
the
outcom
of
the
war
i
do
not
automat
accept
the
argument
that
bosnia
is
ani
wors
than
other
recent
civil
war
say
vietnam
for
instanc
the
differ
is
it
is
happen
to
white
peopl
insid
europ
with
lot
of
tv
coverag
but
if
thi
wa
the
reason
and
if
furthermor
both
side
are
equal
wouldnt
all
u
racist
american
be
favor
the
good
christian
serb
instead
of
the
nonchristian
we
realli
seem
to
favor
both
side
are
certainli
not
equal
in
the
eye
of
the
press
and
that
about
all
we
have
to
go
on
isnt
it
and
i
wish
youd
quit
hurl
word
like
racist
around
there
are
mani
level
at
which
peopl
react
to
what
they
see
at
the
most
fundament
level
you
do
not
have
to
conscious
recogn
the
racial
element
you
simpli
tend
to
empath
more
with
peopl
who
are
like
yourself
a
far
prefer
christian
over
moslem
i
am
an
atheist
myself
and
i
think
youll
agre
that
in
the
u
the
major
of
peopl
do
not
typic
discrimin
on
the
basi
of
religion
nor
give
it
a
particularli
import
place
in
their
world
view
