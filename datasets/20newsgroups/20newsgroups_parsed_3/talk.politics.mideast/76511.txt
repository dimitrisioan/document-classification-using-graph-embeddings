i
wa
cheer
an
attack
on
an
isra
patrol
insid
lebanes
territori
while

wa
condemn
the
retaliatori
shell
of
lebanes
villag
by
isra
and
israeliback
forc
my
team

oppos
team
wa
rearrang
the
face
of
the
spectat
in
my
team
view
stand
so
to
speak
i
think
that
you
should
tri
to
find
more
sourc
of
news
about
what
go
on
in
lebanon
and
tri
to
see
through
the
propaganda
there
are
no
a
priori
black
and
white
hat
but
one
sure
wonder
how
the
idf
can
bombard
villag
in
retali
to
pinpoint
attack
on
it
soldier
in
lebanon
and
then
call
the
lebanes
terrorist
if
the
attack
wa
justifi
or
not
is
at
least
debat
but
thi
is
not
the
issu
the
issu
is
that
you
were
cheer
death
read
again
your
origin
articl
you
find
isra
govern
respons
for
those
dead
soldier
that
a
reason
debat
point
but
feel
satisfact
from

not
reason
by
ani
standard
no
matter
how
you
tri
to
justifi
it
i
may
understand
your
frustrat
against
isra
occup
in

lebanon
but
no
matter
what
you
say
i
can
not
understand
your
satisfact
for
dead
bodi
i
have
a
question
for

let
assum
a
bosnian
villag

a
few
year
ago
and
later
taken
over
by
