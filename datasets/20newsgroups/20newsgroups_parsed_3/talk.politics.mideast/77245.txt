like
what
mr
joseph
biden
had
to
say
yesterday
in
the
senat
condemen
the
european
lack
of
action
and
lack
of
support
to
u
plan
and
call
that
moral
rape
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
reason
for
that
is
out
right
religi
bigotri
part
of
sen
biden
statement
were
quot
by
the
washington
post
today
let
me
put
it
plainli
mr
secretari
you
are
requir
to
speak
diplomat
i
am
not
i
can
not
even
begin
to
express
to
you
my
contempt
for
a
european
polici
that
is
now
ask
u
to
particip
in
what
amount
to
a
codif
of
the
serbian
victori
what
you
have
encount
is
a
discourag
mosaic
of
indiffer
timid
selfdelus
and
hypocrisi
after
they
held
our
coat
on
kuwait
and
somalia
they
are
ask
u
to
put
in
a
few
thousand
troop
on
the
ground
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
speak
and
in
order
to
implement
their
new
idea
of
safe
haven
for
the
bosnian
let
not
minc
word
european
polici
is
base
on
cultur
and
religi
indiffer
if
not
bigotri
and
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
thi
would
be
an
entir
differ
situat
if
the
muslim
were
do
what
the
serb
have
done
if
thi
wa
muslim
aggress
instead
of
serbian
aggress
too
bad
the
washington
post
did
not
includ
hi
next
sentenc
which
point
out
that
a
consequ
of
such
polici
is
a
rise
anger
within
the
islam
world
the
consequ
of
which
we
can
not
begin
to
predict
later
biden
told
a
report
whi
he
spoke
out
i
think
someon
ha
to
respond
to
europ
to
make
it
clear
thi
is
a
big
deal
so
they
will
understand
and
it
is
a
big
deal
