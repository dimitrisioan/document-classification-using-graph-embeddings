could
bm
are
you
throw
the
cypru
buzzword
around
with

in

bm
in
hope
that
the
greek
netter
will
jump
the
gun
absolut
not
i
am
mere
tri
to
emphas
that
in

bm
ye
inde
turkey

the
militari
prowess

interven
what
she
wish
bm
she
had
howev
is
the
diplomat
power
to
stop
the
hostil
and
bring
bm
the
parti
to
the
negoti
tabl
that
hard
to
do
when

the
statesmanship
to
recogn
the
bm
futil
of
arm
conflict
and
convinc
their
nation
that
a
compromis
that
bm
lead
to
stabil
is
much
better
than
a
militari
fait
accompli
that
bm

to
caus
incess
skirmish
armenian
in

want
peac
and
their
