i
find
it
interest
that
mr
major
find
the
genocid
of
two
million
muslim
in
bosnia
accept
now
you
are
actual
claim
that
muslim
have
been
kill
in
bh
pleas
substanti
thi
utterli
ridicul
claim
no
im
not
claim
have
been
kill
we
are
in
the
middl
of
the
genocid
process
that
mr
major
ha
given
yet
anoth
green
light
to
mladic
seem
to
have
most
of
what
he
want
but
boban
is
just
get
hi
appetit
whet
becaus
mladic
refus
to
allow
intern
observ
to
inspect
massgrav
site
and
kill
center
in
place
like
foca
brcko
and
visegrad
it
will
be
year
befor
we
have
an
accur
account
of
the
number
kill
in
practic
term
it
would
be
imposs
to
kill
all
there
just
isnt
the
kind
of
machineri
of
crematorium
and
ga
chamber
and
transport
line
that
the
nazi
took
year
to
develop
and
rememb
the
nazi
kill
minor
in
the
countri
they
occupi
to
actual
kill
of
the
popul
requir
extrem
genocid
organ
but
i
do
claim
that
the
goal
of
the
genocid
is
the
systemat
annihil
of
bosnian
muslim
cultur
by
kill
a
mani
a
is
feasibl
by
rape
by
tortur
by
the
demolit
of
mosqu
librari
and
cultur
artifict
the
burn
and
renam
of
villag
the
shell
of
civilian
so
that
there
wont
be
ani
of
the
or
so
muslim
whose
life
have
not
been
shatter
by
the
genocid
though
they
still
may
be
aliv
and
mr
major
not
onli
find
thi
accept
he
help
it
along
by
make
sure
that
the
