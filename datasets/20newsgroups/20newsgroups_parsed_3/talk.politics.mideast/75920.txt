i
think
thi
part
of
the
translat
is
question
although
i
think
the
origin
quot
is
plain
silli
you
made
it
sound
a
if
it
is
come
from
a
neonazi
youth
for
exampl
turk
talk
of
a
motherland
not
a
german
fatherland
whi
filth
instead
of
dirt
the
indeterminaci
of
translat
is
a
wellknown
problem
so
one
may
have
to
fudg
but
with
some
care
of
cours
is
the
follow
an
equal
valid
translat
the
love
of

is
the
