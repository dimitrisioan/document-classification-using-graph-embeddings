i
guess
that

becaus
germani
also
chose
a
path
of
aggress
simultan
that
put
the
interest
of
other

in
peril
i
wonder
whether
u
or
other
countri
would
have
risk
themselv
if
onli
jew
were
persecut
and
hitler
had
no
imperialist
ambit
i
am
no
student
of
histori
and
i
am
just
ask
question
i
dont
think
they
would
have
after
all
the
u
wa
one
of
the
countri
that
turn
away
jewish
refuge
when
there
wa
still
time
to
get
them
out
consid
and
reject

the
cabinet
level
then
under
what
condit
should

an
abstract

is
be
commit
if
