convinc
that
the

anoth

feel
sorri
for
the
palestinian
ye
i
do
but
i
blame
the
arab
nation

not
israel
i
still
believ
that
we
should
never
confuss
the
action
of
state
with
the
individu
who
happen
to
live
there
in
the
same
way
that
i
do
not
think
it
is
right
to
blame
all
isra
for
the
human
right
violat
of
israel
i
do
not
think
that
we
should
assum
that
all
arab
are
guilti
of
the
action
of
the
arab
state
some
peopl
fled
their
home

they
were
scare
now

are
in
there
still
suffer
for
what
they
are
not
respons
and
rememb
that
we
also
were
told
the
same
at
some
point
we
end
in
the
diaspora
and
of
cours
i
am
not
for

i
did
not
want
