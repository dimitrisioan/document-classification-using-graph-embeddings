a
you
and
the
isra
like
to
view
the
villag
they
are
small
commun
with
kid
play
soccer
in
the

woman
prepar

men
play
card
etc
some
young
men
usual
age
between
to
year
are
member
of
the
lebanes
resist
even
the
inhabit
of
the
villag
do
not
know
who
these
are
they
are
secret
about
it
but
most
peopl
often
suspect
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
up
to
these
young
men
are
support
financi
by
iran
most
of
the
time
they
sneak
arm
and
ammunit
into
the
occupi
zone
where
they
set
up
boobi
trap
for
isra
patrol
everi
time
an
isra
soldier
is
kill
or
injur
by
these
trap
israel
retalli
by
indiscrimin
bomb
villag
of
their
own
choos
often
kill
onli
innoc
civilian
thi
a
tri
and
true
method
util
by
guerilla
and
terrorist
group
to
conduct
oper
in
the
midst
of
the
local
populac
thu
forc
the
oppos
state
to
possibl
harm
innoc
civilian
in
their
search
or
in
order
to
avoid
the
death
of
civilian
abandon
the
search
certainli
the
peopl
who
use
the
popul
for
cover
are
also
to
blaim
for
drag
the
innoc
civilian
into
harm
way
are
you
suggest
that
when
guerilla
use
the
popul
for
cover
israel
should
total
back
down
soth
easiest
way
to
get
away
with
attack
anoth
is
to
use
an
innoc
a
a
shield
and
hope
that
the
other
respect
innoc
life
tell
me
tim
what
are
these
guerilla
do
wrong
assum
that
they
are
use
civilian
for
cover
are
they
not
kill
soldier
in
their
countri
if
the
buffer
zone
is
to
prevent
attack
on
israel
is
it
not
work
whi
is
it
further
neccessari
for
isra
gun
to
pound
lebanes
villag
whi
not
just
kill
those
who
tri
to
infiltr
the
buffer
zone
you
see
there
is
more
to
the
shell
of
the
villag
it
is
call
retali
get
back
get
even
it
doesnt
make
sens
to
shell
the
villag
the
least
it
show
is
a
reckless
disregard
by
the
isra
govern
for
the
life
of
civilian
if
israel
insist
that
the
so
call
secur
zone
is
necessari
for
the
protect
of
northern
israel
than
it
will
have
to
pay
the
price
of
it
occup
with
the
blood
of
it
soldier
if
israel
is
interest
in
peac
than
it
should
withdraw
from
our
land
what
so
the
whole
bit
about
attack
on
israel
from
neighbor
arab
state
can
start
all
over
again
while
i
also
hope
for
thi
to
happen
it
will
onli
occur
when
arab
state
show
that
they
are
prepar
to
take
on
the
respons
and
the
duti
to
stop
guerilla
attack
on
israel
from
their
soil
they
have
to
prove
it
or
provid
some
guarate
there
is
no
way
israel
is
go
to
accept
their
word
not
with
their
past
attitud
of
toler
toward
antiisrael
guerilla
inresid
if
israel
is
not
will
to
accept
the
word
of
other
then
imho
it
ha
no
busi
wast
other
time
come
to
the
peac
talk
i
have
written
befor
on
thi
veri
newsgroup
that
the
onli
real
solut
will
come
a
a
result
of
a
comprehens
peac
settlement
wherebi
israel
withdraw
to
it
own
border
and
peac
keep
troop
are
station
along
the
border
to

no

i
think

that
i
would
gladli
call

he
is
howev
not
me
nor
am
i
lebanes
a
some
seem
to
suspect
thi
is
the
onli
realist
solut
it
is
time
for
israel
to
realiz
that
the
concept
of
a
buffer
zone
aim
at
protect
it
northern
citi
ha
fail
in
fact
it
ha
caus
much
more
isra
death
than
the
occasion
shell
of
northern
israel
would
have
result
in
perhap
you
are
awar
that
to
most
commun
of
peopl
there
is
the
feel
that
it
is
better
that
mani
of
u
die
fight
against
those
who
attack
u
than
for
few
to
die
while
we
silent
accept
our
fate
ifhowev
you
call
on
israel
to
see
the
sens
of
suffer
fewer
casualti
i
suggest
you
appli
the
same
to
palestinian
arab
and
islam
group
tim
you
are
ignor
the
fact
that
the
palestinian
in
lebanon
have
been
disarm
hezbollah
remain
the
onli
independ
militia
hezbollah
doe
not
attack
israel
except
at
a
few
time
such
a
when
the

burn
up
sheikh
mosavi
hi
wife
and
young
son
of
cours
if
israel
would
withdraw
from
lebanon
and
stop
assassin
peopl
and
shell
villag
they
wouldnt
make
the
lebanes
so
mad
a
to
do
that
furthermor
with
hezbollah
subsequ
disarm
it
would
not
be
possibl
and
now
the
lebanes
govern
ha
proven
that
it
is
capabl
of
control
and
disarm
all
militia
a
they
did
in
all
other
part
of
lebanon
basil
it
ha
not
without
the
support
and
activ
involv
of
syria
lebanon
would
not
have
been
abl
to
accomplish
all
that
ha
occur
onc
syria
leaf
who
is
to
say
that
lebanon
will
be
abl
to
retain
control
if
syria
stay
thay
may
be
even
more
danger
for
israel
tim
when
is
the
last
time
that
you
recal
ani
troubl
on
the
syrian
border
not
late
eh
israel
know
veri
well
that
the
syrian
are
abl
to
restrain
all
who
would
use
territori
under
their
control
to
attack
israel
while
lebanon
would
be
better
off
with
syria
and
israel
out
of
it
border
the
presenc
of
syrian
troop
in
lebanon
ha
meant
a
sharp
decreas
in
