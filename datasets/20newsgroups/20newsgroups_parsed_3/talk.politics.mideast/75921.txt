onli
that

that
have

they
will
be
injur
a
both
parti
continu
their
fight
pardon
me
tim
but
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
possibl
for
the
idf
to
fail
to
detect
the
presenc
of
those
respons
for
plant
the
bomb
which
kill
the
three
idf
troop
and
then
later
know
the
exact
number
and
whereabout
of
all
of
them
sever
villag
were
shell
how
could
the
idf
possibl
have
known
that
there
were
guerrilla
in
each
of
the
target
villag
you
see
it
wa
an
arbitrari
act
of
retali
i
will
again
repeat
my
statement
i
do
not
condon
these
indiscrimin
isra
act
nor
have
i
ever
if
the
villag
do
not
know
who
these
guerilla
are
which
you
state
earlier
how
do
you
expect
the
isra
to
know
it
is
veri
difficult
to
identifi
who
they
are
thi
is
whi
the
guerilla
prefer
to
lose
themselv
in
the
gener
popul
by
dress
the
same
act
the
same
etc
the
host
arab
state
did
littlenoth
to
tri
and
stop
these
attack
from
it
side
of
the
border
with
israel
the
problem
tim
is
that
the
origin
reason
for
the
invas
wa
palestinian
attack
on
israel
not
lebanes
attack
i
agre
but
becaus
lebanon
wa
either
unwil
or
unabl
to
stop
these
attack
from
it
territori
should
israel
simpli
sit
quietli
and
accept
it
situat
israel
ask
the
lebanes
govern
over
and
over
to
control
thi
third
parti
state
within
lebanes
territori
and
the
attack
kept
occur
at
what
point
doe
israel
or
ani
state
have
the
right
to
do
someth
itself
to
stop
such
attack
never
while
the
major
armament
those
allow
peopl
to
wage
civil
war
have
been
remov
the
weapon
need
to
crossbord
attack
still
remain
to
some
extent
rocket
attack
still
continu
and
commando
raid
onli
requir
a
few
easili
conceal
weapon
and
a
refin
disregard
for
human
life
your
of
that
of
other
such
attack
also
continu
ye
i
am
afraid
that
what
you
say
is
true
but
that
still
doe
not
justifi
occupi
your
neighbor
land
israel
must
resolv
it
disput
with
the
nativ
palestinian
if
it
want
peac
from
such
attack
it
is
also
the
respons
of
ani
state
to
not
allow
ani
outsid
parti
to
use
it
territori
for
attack
on
a
neighbor
state
if
angola
had
the
power
and
south
africa
refus
or
couldnt
stop
antiangolan
guerilla
base
on
sa
soil
from
attack
angola
and
south
africa
refus
to
have
un
troop
station
on
it
territori
between
it
and
angola
would
angola
be
justifi
in
enter
sa
if
not
are
you
say
that
angola
had
to
accept
the
situat
do
noth
and
absorb
the
attack
bat
guano
the
situat
you
call
for
exist
in
the
s
and
attack
were
commonplac
not
true
lebanes
were
not
attack
israel
in
the
s
with
a
strong
lebanes
govern
free
from
syrian
and
isra
interfer
i
believ
that
the
border
could
be
adequ
patrol
the
palestinian
heavi
weapon
have
been
siez
in
past
year
and
i
do
not
see
a
signific
a
threat
a
onc
exist
i
refer
abov
at
all
time
to
the
palestinian
attack
on
israel
from
lebanes
soil
not
to
lebanes
attack
on
israel
one
hope
that
a
lebanes
govern
will
be
strong
enough
to
patrol
it
border
but
there
is
no
reason
to
believ
it
will
be
ani
stronger
what
ha
chang
is
that
the
plo
wa
larg
driven
out
of
lebanon
not
by
the
lebanes
not
by
syria
and
that
is
by
far
the
most
import
make
it
easier
to
control
futur
palestinian
attack
from
lebanes
soil
that
chang
wa
brought
about
by
isra
action
the
plo
would
never
have
been
eject
by
lebanes
arab
state
or
un
action
pleas
tim
dont
fall
into
the
trap
of
treat
lebanes
and
palestinian
a
all
part
of
the
same
group
there
are
too
mani
who
think
all
arab
or
all
muslim
are
the
same
too
mani
time
i
have
seen
peopl
support
the
bomb
of
palestinian
camp
in
retali
for
an
idf
death
at
the
hand
of
the
lebanes
resist
or
the
shell
of
lebanes
villag
in
retali
for
a
palestinian
attack
i
fulli
recogn
that
the
lebanes
do
not
want
to
be
use
by
either
side
and
have
been
and
continu
to
be
but
the
most
fundament
issu
is
that
if
a
state
can
not
control
it
border
and
make
real
effort
to
do
so
it
should
expect
other
to
do
it
for
them
hope
that
other
will
be
the
un
but
it
is
a
we
see
in
it
cowardic
