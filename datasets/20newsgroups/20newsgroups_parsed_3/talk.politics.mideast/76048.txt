the
way
you
put
it
it
is
onli
the
turk
who
bear
the
respons
of
the
thing
happen
today
that
is
hard
to
believ
for
somebodi
tri
to
be
object
when
it
come
to
conflict
like
our
countri
have
you
can
not
blame
one
side
onli
there
alway
are
bad
guy
on
both
side
what
were
you
do
on
anatolia
after
the
ww
anyway
do
you
think
it
wa
your
right
to
be
there
there
were
a
coupl
million
of
greek
live
in
asia
minor
until
someon
had
to
protect
them
if
not
u
who
i
am
not
say
that
conflict
start
with
that
it
is
onli
not
one
side
be
the
aggress
and
the
ither
alway
suffer
it
is
sad
that
we
both
still
are
not
tri
to
compromis
i
rememb
the
action
of
the
turkish
govern
by
remov
the
visa
requir
for
greek
to
come
to
turkey
i
thought
it
wa
a
posit
attempt
to
make
the
relat
better
compromis
on
what
the
invas
of
cypru
the
invol
of
turkey
in
greek
polit
the
refus
of
turkey
to
accept
mile
of
territori
water
a
state
by
intern
law
the
properti
of
the
greek
of
konstantinopl
the
ownership
of
the
island
in
the
greek
lakesorri
aegean
there
are
some
thing
on
which
there
can
not
be
a
compromis
the
greek
i
mention
who
wouldnt
talk
to
me
are
educ
peopl
they
have
never
met
me
but
they
know
i
am
bad
person
becaus
i
am
from
turkey
polit
is
not
my
busi
and
it
is
not
the
busi
of
most
of
the
turk
when
it
come
to
individu
whi
the
hatr
ani
person
who
support
the
polici
of
the
turkish
gover
directli
or
indirecli
is
a
bad
person
it
is
not
your
nation
that
make
you
bad
it
is
your
support
of
the
action
of
your
gover
that
make
you
bad
peopl
do
not
hate
you
becaus
of
who
you

becaus
of
what
you

a
support
of
the
polici
of
the
turkish
gover
and
a
a
such
you
must
pay
the
price

me
think
that

is
some
kind
of
brainwash

on
in
greec
after
