pano
mr

the
way
you
put
it
it
is
onli
the
turk
who
bear
the
respons
of
the
thing
happen
today
that
is
hard
to
believ
for
somebodi
tri
to
be
object
when
it
come
to
conflict
like
our
countri
have
you
can
not
blame
one
side
onli
there
alway
are
bad
guy
on
both
side
what
were
you
do
on
anatolia
after
the
ww
anyway
do
you
think
it
wa
your
right
to
be
there
i
am
not
say
that
conflict
start
with
that
it
is
onli
not
one
side
be
the
aggress
and
the
ither
alway
suffer
it
is
sad
that
we
both
still
are
not
tri
to
compromis
i
rememb
the
action
of
the
turkish
govern
by
remov
the
visa
requir
for
greek
to
come
to
turkey
i
thought
it
wa
a
posit
attempt
to
make
the
relat
better
the
greek
i
mention
who
wouldnt
talk
to
me
are
educ
peopl
they
have
never
met
me
but
they
know
i
am
bad
person
becaus
i
am
from
turkey
polit
is
not
my
busi
and
it
is
not
the
busi
of
most
of
the
turk
when
it
come
to
individu
whi
the
hatr
so
that
make
me
think
that
there
is
some
kind
of
brainwash
go
on
in
greec
after
all
whi
would
an
educ
person
treat
everi
person
from
a
nation

same
way
