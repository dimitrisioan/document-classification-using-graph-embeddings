at
all
time
and
under

their
oppon
are
legitim
target
onli
when
mirand
or
some
such
im
sure
that

perfect
sens
if
you
grant
apriori
that

that
therefor
kill

the
corollari
is
that
the
hezbollah

like

well
you
should
have
note
that
i
wa
cheer
an
attack
on
an
isra
patrol
insid
lebanes
territori
while
i
wa
condemn
the
retaliatori
shell
of
lebanes
villag
by
isra
and

forc
my
team
you

wa
rearrang
the
face
of
the
spectat
in

stand
so
to
speak
i
think
that
you
should
tri
to
find
more
sourc
of
news
about
what
go
on
in
lebanon
and
tri
to
see
through
the
propaganda
there
are
no
a
priori
black
and
white
hat
but
one
sure
wonder
how
the
idf
can
bombard
villag
in
retali
to
pinpoint
attack
on
it
soldier
in
lebanon
and
then
call
the
lebanes
terrorist
