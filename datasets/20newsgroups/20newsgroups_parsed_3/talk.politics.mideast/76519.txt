even
though
the

popul
while

isnt
engag
in
a
civil

to
attempt
to
destroy
the
govern
thi
probabl
should
not
be
in
thi
newgroup
but
mr
frank
is
wrong
to
use
word
like
civil
war
or
destroy
the
govern
in
discus
the
conflict
in
the
occupi
territori
re
the
newsgroup
followup
set
to
talkpoliticsmideast
where
thi
belong
thi
may
make
the
term
civil
war
dubiou
but
it
doe
noth
to
the
phrase
destroy
the
govern
an
occupi
govern
is
still
a
govern
ment
and
the
palestinian
have
made
it
quit
clear
that
their
goal
is
not
simpli
to
prevent
it
from
occupi
the
territori
that
dont
con
fer
citizenship
which
is
your
own
determin
of
the
distinct
but
to
wipe
it
out
entir
and
not
incident
the
entir
jewish
popul
it
rule
with
it
thi
is
an
intent
to
destroy
the
govern
no
matter
where
the
govern
happen
to
be
from
if
the
current
govern
in
isreal
would
be
will
to
let
all
adult
individu
who
are
capabl
to
vote
in
elect
within
the
defacto
boundari
of
the
isreali
state
a
requir
for
be
call
a
democraci
in
my
opinion
wasnt
a
requir
for
democraci
in
athen
for
that
matter
isnt
a
requir
for
the
term
democraci
in
the
unit
state
which
doesnt
let
noncitizen
vote
either
both
the
unit
state
and
israel
have
process
wherebi
it
is
possibl
to
acquir
citizenship
with
a
great
deal
of
effort
and
a
modicum
of
screen
it
just
that
it
isnt
automat
for
live
in
the
territori
it
isnt
automat
for
live
in
new
york
either
that
said
suit
yourself
have
never
consid
democraci
the
ultim
in
good
in
thi
world
i
could
care
le
if
you
feel
like
call
israel
or
america
or
anywher
el
a
democraci
person
i
withhold
the
term
from
israel
for
the
same
reason
i
withhold
it
from
britain
the
parliamentari
system
is
a
seriou
handicap
then
mr
frank
would
be
correct
a
the
current
govern
neither
is
will
to
enfrachis
the
vast
major
of
individu
in
the
territori
or
to
allow
these
peopl
to
have
the
right
to
self
determin
it
is
not
a
civil
war
or
their
govern
rather
it
is
resit
to
a
foreign
occupi
again
suit
yourself
in
which
case
israel
is
not
attack
it
own
peopl
it
is
fight
a
war
on
foreign
soil
in
which
case
the
resid
are
entitl
to
play
rough
ye
but
israel
allow
to
get
just
a
rough
within
the
bare
limit
of
the
rule
of

includ
