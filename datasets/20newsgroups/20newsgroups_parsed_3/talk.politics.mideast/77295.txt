believ
in

islam
is
a
religion
and
it
is
practis
in
mani

bosnia
muslim
is
not
mere
a
religi

but
an
ethnic
one
a
well
actual
here
are
the
two
contradictori
argument
made

there
is
onli
serbian

croatian
nation
and
bosnian
muslim
are
simpli
croat
and
serb
of

sinc
they
do
not
feel
themselv
to
be
croat
nor
serb
in
argument
wa
accept
by
former

a
valid
and
wa
soundli
reject
the
reason
are
pragmat
even
if
bosnian
muslim
are
croat
and
serb
who
convert
to

under

rule
centuri
ago
none

actual
nation
in

although
bosnian
muslim
have
felt
drawn
to
croatian
or
serbian
nation
allegi
most
of
them
feel
they
have
a
separ
cultur

so
argument
like
ye
but
your

carri
veri
littl
weight
regardless
of
what
their
ancestor
might
have
been
a
long
a
bosnian
muslim
feel
that
they
are
a
separ

group
that
end
the
debat
what
outsid
say
is
simpli
not
relev
the
way
the
western
press
use
the
word
muslim
in
thi
bosnian
debacl
ha
kept
me
wonder
when
the
mean
of
muslimmoslem
i
knew
from
childhood
wa
chang
in
the
dictionari
thi
is
just
a
question
no
flame
intend
in
the
case
of
former
yugoslavia
the
date
is
when
muslim
nation
appear
a
a
censu
categori
for
the
first
time
thi
wa
the
result
of
a
sequenc
of
decis
over
the
past
decad
from
recogn
bosniak
a
an

to

they

muslim
nation
perhap
the
term
bosnian
muslim
nation
is
too
confus
for
the
rest
of
the
world
but
in
the
present
context
we
are
talk
about
muslim
a
nation
not
a
a

within

ident
the
reason

religion
