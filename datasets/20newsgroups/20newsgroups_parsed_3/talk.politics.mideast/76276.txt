problem
some
of

had
noth
but
scorn
for
number
though
secretli
afraid
of
them
other
steer
clear
of
such
puzzl
book
becaus
they
were
master
of
incompar
more
difficult
branch
of
modern
mathemat
and
didnt
mind
say
for
all
the
world
to
hear
that
they
didnt
know
how
to
solv
mere
arithmet

profession
mathematician
were
no
except
here
what
the
russian
mathematician
alexand
khinchin
a
specialist
in

wrote
about
arithmet
i
willingli
confess
that
ani
time
a
fifthgrad
ask
me
to
help
solv
an
arithmet
problem
it
wa
a
hard
work
for
me
and
sometim
i
fail
complet
of
cours
like
most
of
my
friend
i
could
easili
solv
the
problem
by
the
natur
algebra
rout
construct
equat
or
set
of
equat
but
we
were
suppos
to
avoid
use
algebra
analysi
at
all
cost
by
the
way
it
a
fact
that
is
well
known
and
oft
repeat
that
a
a
rule
neither
high

begin
their

nor
i
must
add
scientif

it
seem
the
onli
peopl
in
