violat
a
feder

a
local
american
law
seem
to
belong
to
some
local
american

forum
not

the
reader
of
thi

seem
to
be
more
interest
in
the

of

so
it
will
be
nice
if

not
awar
that

consid
me
danger
in
ani
case
that
ha
noth
to
do
with
the
current
case
the
claim
against
the
adl
is
that
it
illeg
obtain
and
dissemin
inform
that
wa
gather
by
state
andor
feder
agenc
in
the
cours
of

doe
the
adl
have
an
interest
in
that
person
you
should
ask
the
adl
if
you
want
an
authorit
answer
my
guess
is
that
they
collect
inform
on
anyon
who
did
or
might
engag
in
polit
critic
of
israel
i
further
believ
that
they
did
thi
a
agent
of
the
isra
govern
or
at
least
in
agreement
with
them
at
least
some
of
the
