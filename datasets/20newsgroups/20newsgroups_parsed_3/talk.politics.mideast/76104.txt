appar
think
you
are
some
sort
of
oneman
judg
and
juri
who
can
declar
total
victori
and
then
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
applaus
but
youv
pick
the
wrong
topic
if
you
think
a
few
rig
quotat
can
sustain
the
legend
and
lie
of
the
deir
yassin
massacr
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
when
it
come
to
histor
methodolog
at
the
most
basic
level
you
should
know
that
there
is
a
big
differ
between
weigh
evid
fairli
and
mere
find
quotat
that
support
your
preset
opinion
if
you
have
studi
the
histori
of
israel
at
all
you
must
know
that
mani
of
the
sourc
of
your

have
an
axe
to
grind
and
therefor
you
must
be
veri
care
about
whom
you
quot
for
exampl
meir
pail
whom
you
cite
wa
inde
a
gener
a
scholar
and
a
war
hero
but
that
doesnt
mean
everyth
that
come
out
of
hi
mouth
is
gold
in
fact
and
here
your
lack
of
experi
show
pail
is
such
a
fanat
embitt
leftist
that
much
of
hi
antiisrael
blather
forget
about
antiirgun
blather
would
be
consid
someth
like
treason
in
nonisrael
context
but
of
cours
you
dont
consid
thi
at
all
when
you
find
a
juici
quotat
that
you
can
use
to
attack
israel
benni
morri
of
hashom
hatzair
repres
himself
a
a
scholar
when
he
rehash
the
old
attack
on
the

dont
be
fool
it
just
the
old
zionist
ideolog
catfight
surfac
a
an
attack
on
the

if
you
will
look
close
at
the

base
on
noth
the

get
the
feel
peopl
like
to
blame
the
jew
for
massacr
even
if
they
have
to
make
them
up
it
must
sound
