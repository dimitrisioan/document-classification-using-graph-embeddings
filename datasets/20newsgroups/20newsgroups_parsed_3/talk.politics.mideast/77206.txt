which
wa
my
point
by
convert
to
anoth
religion
i
do
not
loo
my
cultur
ident
i
just
loo
my
religi
identif
i
consid
that
defin
the
belong
to
a
nation
that
claim
the
right
to
have
a
state
base
on
religi
belief
is
a
form
of
racism
to
be
a
part
or
not
of
the
jeish
nation
is
defin
by
my
cultur
and
not
by
my
religion
actual
if
i
am
an
atheist
which
is
in
fact
like
convert
into
a
nonjewish
in
term
of
religion
i
am
still
consid
a
part
of
the
jewish
nation
i
can
be
proud
of
my
jewish
cultur
while
not
give
ani
import
to
the
jewish
religion
or
even
more
i
can
be
proud
of
my
jewish
cultur
while
still
be
convinc
that
the
real
god
is
anoth
one
i
do
not
know
anyon
who
lost
hi
memebership
to
the
american
nation
becaus
he
chang
of
god
alberto
youv
repeatedli
misunderstood
my
post
you
are
now
make
the
exact
point
that
ive
made
sever
time
but
with
a
differ
definit
of
religion
you
dont
not
have
to
believ
in
the
religi
aspect
of
judaism
to
be
a
jew
thi
would
confin
judaism
to
be
just
a
religion
in
the
sen
of
a
christian
so
by
convert
out
of
judaism
i
dont
mean
just
not
believ
in
the
god
of
judaism
i
mean
voluntarili
remov
yourself
from
the
jewish
nation
i
am
an
agnost
but
still
consid
myself
jewish
becaus
of
my
cultur
heritag
i
admit
that
mani
religi
jew
would
argu
that
i
am
not
complet
jewish
becaus
of
my
lack
of
faith
but
judaism
is
a
religion
of
dissent
and
debat
isnt
it
the
fact
that
one
can
opt
to
becom
jewish
simpli
by
convert
to
judaism
make
the
nation
of
the
jewish
peopl
the
least
racist
and
most
open
nation
we
have
no
quota
so
i
will
onc
again
make
my
point
defin
a
member
of
the
jewish
nation
by
religion
not
a
you
say
religi
belief
is
not
racism
you
come
to
your
incorrect
conclus
becaus
you
use
a
differ
definit
for
religion
when
you
defin
the
law
of
return
and
when
you
defin
judaism
