reza
mehm
abuab
anwar

and
other
who
think
that
jihad
is
the
onli
solut
if
we
cant
avoid
throw
out
gutreact
to
what
we
see
a
extremist
view
here
in
the
newsgroup
were
certainli
not
go
to
be
ani
better
at
it
in
the
real
world
hey
it
easi
here
after
read
the
offend
post
we
can
step
back
take
some
deep

exercis
have
a
gallon
of
ice
cream
or
sex
whichev
calmsu
and
repli
in
someth
other
than
the
usual
kingofthehil
mental
my
view
is
that
israel
ha
made
more
gestur
toward
it
arab
foe
than
the
opposit
what
have
the
sysrian
given
to
u
or
propos
what
have
the
palestinian
propos
if
the
palestinian
would
just
revok
or
rewrit
their
charter
or
just
condemn
act
of
palestinian
violenc
that
would
be
a
good
start
perhap
start
here
with
an
immedi
accus
is
not
a
particularli
good
way
to
gener
open
respons
how
about
explain
what
you
see
a
be
israel
real
worri
and
how
they
need
to
be
address
sinc
the
other
side
see
israel
gestur
in
a
complet
differ
light
than
you
do
perhap
they
also
have
real
worri
from
their
point
of
view
what
are
they
how
can
those
worri
be
address
the
palestinian
have
all
to
gain
from
these
negoti
it
seem
though
that
they
are
not
strong
enough
to
make
decis
on
their
own
and
are
plagu
by
intern
strife
that
is
whi
we
are
not
get

fundament
is
slowli
take

then
it
will
be
too
late
to
discu

with
the
palestinian
sinc
they
will
onli
vow
for
the
destruct
of
israel
it
is
certainli
much
harder
to
reach
compromis
or
even
sit
down
and
talk
with
an
other
side
which
is
fractur
