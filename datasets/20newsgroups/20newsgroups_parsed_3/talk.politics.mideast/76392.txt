were
taken
to
bagirov
i
dont
rememb
how
mani
dead
were
contain
in
the
list
but
it
a
fact
that
when
gukasian
came
in
a
coupl
of
minut
later
he
wa
cur
and
wa
terribl
irat
i
ask
what
go
on
he
said
lyuda
can
you
imagin
what
anim
what
scoundrel
they
are
they
say
that
they
lost
the
list
of
the
dead
piotr
demichev
member
of
the
politburo
of
the
central
committe
of
the
communist
parti
of
the
ussr
ha
just
arriv
and
we
were
suppos
to
submit
the
list
to
him
so
that
hed
see
the
scope
of
the
slaughter
of
the
tragedi
whether
it
wa
one
or
fifti
they
told
him
that
the
list
had
disappear
and
they
should
ask
everyon
who
hadnt
left
for
the
khimik
board
hous
all
over
again
there
were
peopl
on
our
second
list
i
think
that
the
number
wa
the
one
that
got
into
the
press
and
onto
televis
and
the
radio
becaus
that
the
list
that
demichev
got
i
rememb
exactli
that
there
were
peopl
on
the
list
i
had
even
told
aleksandr
mikhailovich
that
that
wa
onli
a
half
of
those
that
were
on
the
first
list
he
said
lyuda
plea
tri
to
rememb
at
least
one
more
but
i
couldnt
rememb
anyon
el
but
there
were
more
than
dead
of
that
i
am
certain
the
govern
and
the
procuraci
dont
count
the
peopl
who
die
of
fright
like
sick
peopl
and
old
peopl
whose
live
are
threaten
by
ani
shock
they
werent
regist
a
victim
of
the
sumgait
tragedi
and
then
there
may
be
peopl
we
didnt
know
so
mani
peopl
left
sumgait
between
march
and
most
of
them
left
for
smaller
town
in
russia
and
especi
to
the
northern
caucasu
to
stavropol
and
the
krasnodarsk
territori
we
dont
have
ani
inform
on
them
i
know
that
there
are
peopl
who
set
out
for
part
around
moscow
in
the
period
krestyanka
woman
farmer
there
wa
a
call
for
peopl
who
know
how
to
milk
cow
and
for
mechan
and
driver
and
i
know
a
whole
group
of
peopl
went
to
help

also
clearli
not

are
those
peopl
who
die
enter
the
citi
who

their
car
no
one
know
about
them
except
the
azerbaijani
who
are
hardli
like
to
say
anyth
about
it
and
there
more
a
great
mani
of
the
peopl
who
were
rape
were
not
includ
in
the
list
drawn
up
at
the
procuraci
i
know
of
three
instanc

the
first
day
we
bought
everyth
although
we
should
have
receiv
it
for
free
they
were
suppos
to
have
been
dispens
free
of
charg
and
they
sold
it
to
u
then
when
we
found
out
it
wa
free
we
went
to
krayev
at
the
time
fortun
you
could
still
drop
by
to
see
him
like
a
neighbor
all
the
more
so
sinc
everyth
wa
still
clearli
visibl
on
our
face
krayev
sent
a
captain
down
and
he
resolv
the
issu
on
march
they
sent
two
investig
to
see
u
andrei
shirokov
and
vladimir
fedorovich
bibishev
the
way
it
work
out
in
our
famili
they
had
consid
onli
karina
and
me
victim
mayb
becaus
she
and
i
wound
up
in
the

mother
and

are
consid
wit
but
not
victim
shirokov
wa
involv
with
karina
case
and
bibishev
with
mine
after
i
told
him
everyth
he
and
i
plan
to
sit
down
with
the
identikit
and
record
everyon
i
could
rememb
while
everyth
wa
still
fresh
in
my
mind
we
didnt
work
with
the
identikit
until
the
veri
last
day
becaus
the
condit
werent
there
the
investig
group
work
slowli
and
did
poor
qualiti
work
sole
becaus
the
situat
wasnt
conduc
to

there
werent

automobil
especi
dure
the
time
when
there
wa
a
curfew
and
there
were
no
typewrit
for
type
transcript
and
no
still
or
video
camera
i
think
that
thi
wa
done
on
purpos
were
not
so
poor
that
we
cant
suppli
our
investig
with
all
that
stuff
it
wa
done
especi
to
draw
out
the
investig
all
the
more
so
sinc
the
local
author
saw
that
the
armenian
were
leav
at
the
speed
of
light
never
to
return
to
sumgait
and
the
armenian
had
a
lot
to
say
i
came
to
an
agreement
with
bibishev
i
told
him
myself

u
a
month
or

so
much
to

that
for
a
while
they
didnt

she

pull
a

and
in

on
the
th
they

those
he
didnt

if

would
have
sustain
lesser
bodili
injuri
they
would
have
beat
her
le
an
older
woman
from
our
build
aunt
nazan
an
azerbaijani
all
but
lay
on
top
of
karina
cri
and
plead
that
they
leav

but
they
flung
her

age
woman
from

she
alreadi
retir
mountain

and
azerbaijani
too
have
a
custom
if

scarf
under
their
foot
to
stop
them
but
they
trampl
her
scarf
and
sent
her
home
to
trampl
a

is
tantamount
to
trampl
a
woman
honor
now
that
the
investig
is
go
on
now
that
a
lot
is
behind
u
and
we
have
gotten
back
to
be
ourselv
a
littl
i
think
about
how
could
these
event
that
are
now
call
the
sumgait
tragedi
happen
how
did
they
come
about
how
did
it
start
could
it
have
been
avoid
well
it
clear
that
without
a
signal
without
permiss
from
the
top
leadership
it
would
not
have
happen
all
the
same
im
not
afraid
to
say
thi
the
azerbaijani
let
other
worthi
peopl
take
no
offens
the
better
repres
of
their
nation
let
them
take
no
offens
but
the
azerbaijani
in
their
major
are
a
peopl
who
are
kept
in
line
onli
by
fear
of
the
law
fear
of
retribut
for
what
they
have
done
and
when
the
law
said
that
they
could
do
all
that
like
unleash
dog
who
were
afraid
they
wouldnt
have
time
to
do
everyth
they
threw
themselv
from
one
thing
to
the
next
so
a
to
be
abl
to
get
more
done
to
snatch
a
bit
more
the
smell
of
the
danger
wa
alreadi
in
the
air
on
februari
you
could
tell
that
someth
wa
