muslim
netter
thi
is
the
same
guy
who
gave
a
fatwah
that
saudi
arabia
can
be
use
by
the
unit
stste
to
attack
iraq
they
were
attack
the
iraqi
to
drive
them
out
of
kuwait
a
countri
whose
citizen
have
close
blood
and
busi
tie
to
saudi
citizen
and
me
think
if

u
had
not
help
out
the
iraqi
would
have
swallow
saudi
arabia
too
or
at
least
the
eastern
oilfield
and
no
muslim
countri
wa
do
much
of
anyth
to
help
liber
kuwait
and
protect
saudi
arabia
inde
in
some
mass
of

were
demonstr
in
favor
of
that
butcher
saddam
who
kill
lotsa
muslim
just
becaus
he
wa
kill
rape

better
off
had
they
left
the

iraq
togeth

concentr

take
out
saddam
a
strong

iraq
with
an

govern
would
have
gone
a
long
way
to
rid
the
