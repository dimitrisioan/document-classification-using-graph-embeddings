have
state
my
assumpt
i
will
now
state
my
propos
a
fund
should
be
establish
which
would
disburs
grant
for
each
child
born
to
a
coupl
where
one
partner
is
israelijew
and
the
other
palestinianarab
to
be
entitl
for
a
grant
a
coupl
will
have
to
prove
that
one
of
the
partner
posse
or
is
entitl
to
isra
citizenship
under
the
law
of
return
and
the
other
partner
although
born
in
area
under
current
isreali
control
is
not
entitl
to
such
citizenship
under
the
law
of
return
for
the
first
child
the
grant
will
amount
to
for
the
second
the
third
child
for
each
child
for
each
subsequ
child
the
grant
will
amount
to
for
each
child
the
fund
would
be
financ
by
a
varieti
of
sourc
which
have
shown
interest
in
promot
a
peac
solut
to
the
israeliarab
conflict
includ
the
u
govern
jewish
and
christian
organ
in
the
u
and
a
great
number
of
govern
and
intern
organ
the
emerg
of
a
consider
number
of
mix
marriag
in
israelpalestin
all
of
whom
would
have
rel
on
both
side
of
the
divid
would
make
the
conflict
lose
it
ethnic
and
unsolubl
core
and
strengthen
the
emerg
of
a
truli
civil
societi
the
exist
of
a
strong
mix
stock
of
peopl
would
also
help
the
integr
of
isra

into
the
middleeast
in
a

manner
object

certainli
be

will
attempt
to
identifi
some
of
these
the
idea
of

marriag
is
not

howev
it
is
base
on
the

is
recogn
a
a

it
may
be
object
that
the
israelipalestinian
conflict
is
not
primarili
a
religi
or
ethnic
conflict
but
that
it
is
a
conflict
between
a
colonialist
settler

and
an
indigen

that
can
onli
regain

is
base
on
the
assumpt
that
the
enemi
is
not
zionism
a
ideolog

israelijewish
societi
and
it
member

will
have
to

it
