wrote
zucker
the
legal
counsel
of
the

attorney
mordechai
shiffman
said
that
we
a
the
civil

union
do
not
know
of
ani
case
of
secur
prison
citizen
of
israel
who
are
imprison
and
whose
imprison
can
not
be
made
public
thi
is
a
situat
which
if
it
actual
exist
is
definit
unhealthi
just
like
censorship
is
an
unhealthi
matter
the
union
is
awar
say
shiffman
of
case
where
notif
of
a
suspect
arrest
to
famili
member
and
lawyer
is
withheld
i
am
speak
onli
of
sever
day
i
know
also
of
case
where
a
detaine
wa
not
allow
to
meet
with
an
attorney
sometim
for
the
whole
first
month
of
arrest
that
is
done
becaus
of
the
great
secreci
the
suspect
himself
hi
famili
hi
lawyer
or
even
a
journalist
can
challeng
the
public
ban
in
court
but
there
are
case
where
the
famili
member
themselv
are
not
interest
in
public
the
journalist
know
noth
of
the
arrest
and
so
almost
everyon
is
happi
attorney
yossi
arnon
an
offici
of
the
bar
claim
that
given
the
law
a
they
exist
in
israel
today
a
situat
where
the
arrest
of
a
person
for
secur
offens
is
kept
secret
is
definit
possibl
noth
is
easier
the
court
order
a
public
ban
and
that
that
someon
who
ha
commit
secur
offens
can
spend
long
year
in
prison
without
u
know
anyth
about
it
do
you
find
thi
situat
accept
attorney
arnon
definit
not
we
live
in
a
democrat
countri
and
such
a
state
of
affair
is
impermiss
i
am
well
awar
that
public
can
be
damag
from
the
standpoint
of
secur
but
total
nonpubl
silenc
is
unaccept
consid
the
trial
of
mordechai
vanunu
at
least
in
hi
case
we
know
that
he
wa
charg
with
aggrav
espionag
and
sentenc
to
year
in
prison
the
trial
wa
held
behind
close
door
nobodi
knew
the
detail
except
for
those
who
were
author
to
it
is
somehow
possibl
to
understand
though
not
to
accept
the
reason
but
a
i
have
note
we
at
least
are
awar
of
hi
imprison
whi
is
the
matter
actual
that
seriou
cant
we
trust
the
discret
of
the
court
attorney
arnon
the
judg
have
no
choic
but
to
trust
the
present
made
to
them
the
judg
do
not
have
the
tool
to
investig
thi
give
the
govern
enorm
power
power
which
they
can
misus
and
what
if
there
realli
is
a
secur
issu
attorney
arnon
i
am
a
man
of
the
legal
system
not
a
secur
expert
democraci
stand
in
opposit
to

i
believ
it
is
possibl
to
public
the
matter
of
the
arrest
and
the
charg
without
enter
into
detail
we
have
alreadi
seen
how
the
law
concern
public
ban
can
be
misus
in
the
case
of
the
rachel
heller
murder
a
suspect
in
the
murder
wa
held
for
mani
month
without
the
matter
be
made
public
attorney
shiffman
on
the
other
hand
belief
that
state
secur
can
be
a
legitim
reason
for
prohibit
public
of
a
suspect
arrest
or
of
a
convict
crimin
imprison
a
healthi
situat
definit
not
but
i
am
awar
of
the
fact
that
mere
public
may
be
harm
to
state
secur
a
differ
opinion
is
express
by
attorney
uri
shtendal
former
advisor
for
arab
affair
to
prime
minist
levi
eshkol
and
golda
meir
clearli
we
are
speak
of
isol
special
case
such
situat
contrast
with
the
principl
that
a
judici
proceed
must
be
held
in
public
no
doubt
thi
contradict
the
principl
of
freedom
of
express
definit
also
to
the
principl
of
individu
freedom
which
is
also
harm
by
the
prohibit
of

nevertheless
add
shtendal
the
legisl
allow
for
the
possibl
of
such
a
ban
to
accommod
special
case
where
the
damag
possibl
a

is
greater
than
that
which
may
follow
from
an

of

principl
ive
mention

such

doe
not
