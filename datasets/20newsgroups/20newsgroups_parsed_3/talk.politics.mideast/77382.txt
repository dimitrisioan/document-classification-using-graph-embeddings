for

consid
the

with
respect
to
the
human
right
of
the

peopl
a
an

thati
oppos
what

what
the
jewish
peopl
learn
about
oppres
segreg
and
year
in
the

i
agre
with
you
but
i
also
feel
that
when
a
cultur
feel
it
is
confront
by
anoth
group
that
wish
to
see
that
cultur
disassembl
the
first
cultur
ha
littl
choic
but
to
tri
to
secur
it
surviv
a
well
a
maintain
it
moral
center
sinc
the
cultur
is
not
about
to
turn
away
from
either
the
matter
of
it
surviv
or
the
valu
of
it
moral
principl
it
ha
the
virtual
imposs
job
of
balanc
to
discus
israel
fault
and
crime
without
ani
recognit
of
thi
circumst
and
realiti
it
face
is
a
consciou
decis
base
on
the
discus
polit
bias
not
on
an
honest
and
empathet
open
understand
of
the
situat
the
same
appli
to
those
who
attempt
to
paint
the
palestinian
movement
a
all
bad
and
dispens
with
consider
of
the
realiti
face
them
that
certainli
describ
elia
sinc
he
ha
no
intent
of
recogn
that
alongsid
the
palestinian
experi

perspect
there
exist
also
that

he
might
not
want
to
recogn
that
it
doe
not
make
him
a
selfhat
jew
a
far
a
i
see
it
at
most
he
is
a
person
who
is
not
tell
the
truth
you
beg
the
question
by
center
on
the
symptom
while
the
issu
of
selfhat
address
the
motiv
i
certainli
feel
that
anyon
who
expend
so
much
effort
inflat
distort
and
rob
human
context
from
aspect
of
hisher
own
cultur
is
reflect
a
degre
of
dislik
for
it
sinc
bit
of
that
cultur
are
bound
due
to
hisher
upbring
to
be
a
part
of
himher
a
bit
of
self
dislik
seem
like
to
be
mix
in

is
a

a

whose
integr
decay
when
unmov
by
the

that
is
whi
i
get

when
i
see
the

in

a
much
a
i
get

when
i
see
a
plestinian
stabe
peopl
in
israel
and
thi
is
precis
whi
isra
societi
ha
been
tremend
harm
by
the

it
it
govern
ha
felt
it
had
to
take
in
respons
to
an

perceiv
a
a
threat
just
a
with
you
there
ha
long
been
a
strident
and
emot
debat
about
the
pain
isra
feel
when
forc
to
balanc
desir
for
surviv
and
moral
belief
the
trauma
of
have
to
make
that
choic
is
made
wors
by
the
fact
that
neither
can
be
conveni
brush
asid
a
a
result
of
a
reason
polit
debat
for
the
sake
of
the
other
onli
reshap
but
so
far
it
seem
that
the
blame
is
alway
put
on
the
other
if
you
read
thi
newsgroup
for
exampl
israel
is
never
guilti
by
herself
she
is
alway
respond
to
the
action
of
the
other
and
it
goe
a
if
the
action
of
isreal
do
not
also
affect
the
respons
of
the
other
in
a
cycl
that
never
end
also
there
is
blind
to
tri
to
understand
what
the
other
feel
and
whi
a
you
well
know
thi
process
of
blame
the
other
for
the
moral
question
action
one
side
is
forc
by
the
other
of
cours
to
take
is
thoroughli
practic
by
both
side
if
you
are
onli
hear
the
proisra
crowd
selfsupport
argument
that
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
you
are
not
listen
for
anyth
el
i
certainli
hear
the
similarli
distort
propalestinianproarab
element
in
thi
newsgroup
a
well
a
in
socculturearab
there
is
alway
and
excus
there
is
alway
a
rational
to
explain
whi
thing
happen
a
they
do
and
what
is
the
worst
part
for
me
there
seem
to
be
all
the
time
an
intent
to
tri
to
dehuman
the
other

if
the

i
certainli
do
wonder

the
