that
while

number
of

do
so
onli
if

plu
they
paid
fair
market
valu
etc
they
did
not
know
they
were
victim
of
an
intern
conspiraci
im
not
a
conspiraci
theorist
myself
but
thi
one
is
hard
to
dismiss
right
now
im
just
go
to
address
thi
point
when
the
jewish
nation
fund
bought
most
of
it
land
it
didnt
buy
it
from
the
palestinian
themselv
becaus
for
the
most
part
they
were
tenant
farmer
fallahin
live
on
land
own
by
wealthi
arab
in
syria
and
lebanon
the
jnf
offer
a
premium
deal
so
the
owner
took
advantag
of
it
it
call
commerc
the
owner
howev
made
no
provis
for
those
who
had
work
for
them
basic
shaft
them
by
sell
the
land
right
out
from
under
them
they
are
to
blame
not
the
jew
amir
whi
would
you
categor
the
sale
of
land
a
shaft
wa
it
becaus
it
wa
sold
to
jew
wa
it
fair
to
assum
that
the
fallahin
would
be
mistreat
by
the
jew
is
thi
the
norm
of
ani
commerc
read
shaft
between
arab
and
jew
it
wa
shaft
on
the
part
of
the
arab
land
owner
for
do
it
without
notifi
their
tenant
farmer
and
for
not
be
respons
enough
to
make
provis
for
them
but
rather
just
leav
them
to
their
fate
your
claim
that
the
lebanesesyrian
landlord
sold
palestin
if
true
even
partial
omit
the
fact
that
the
mandat
treati
put
lebanon
and
syria
under
french
rule
while
palestin
under
british
obivi
ani
such
landlord
would
have
found
himself
a
foreign
in
palestin
and
would
be
motiv
to
sell
regardless
of
the
price
the
point
is
that
the
land
wa
sold
legal
often
at
price
abov
it
actual
valu
it
wa
legal
and
good
busi
for
the
seller
though
it
left
the
palestinian
who
work
the
land
in
a
poor
situat
it
is
interest
though
that
you
acknowledg
that
the
palestinian
were
shaft
do
mani
isra
or
jew
share
your
opinion
do
you
absolv
the
purchas
from
ani
ethic
commit
just
becaus
it
wasnt
written
down
i
dont
know
if
other
share
thi
opinion
it
is
mine
and
im
sure
there
are
some
who
agre
and
some
who
dont
the
way
i
see
it
the
fallahin
were
caught
in
circumst
beyond
their
control
in
that
sinc
they
didnt
own
the
land
they
didnt
have
a
say
of
cours
now
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
arab
uniti
the
arab
are
angri
that
the
land
wa
sold
to
the
jew
an
act
that
is
illeg
in
jordan
but
when
it
happen
it
wa
just
busi
all
told
i
did
not
see
an
answer
in
your
respons
the
question
wa
whether
the
intent
behind
the
purchas
wa
aim
at
control
the
public
asset
land
infrastructur
etc
imho
the
palestinian
have
ground
to
contest
the
legal
of
the
purchas
say
in
world
court
sam
my
opinion
are
my
own
and
no
one
el
the
purpos
of
buy
the
land
wa
to
provid
space
and
job
for
jewish
immigr
in
ani
case
no
matter
what
the
purpos
the
sale
were
legal
so
i
realli
dont
see
ani
ground
for
contest
them
amir
