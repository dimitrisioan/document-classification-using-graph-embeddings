look
how
long
it
took
and
to
what
insignific
posit
they

assign
and
thi
is
base
sole
on
race
not
polit
belief
or
secur
a
jewish
member
of
the

alway
been
welcom
just
not
their
fellow
arab
first
of
all
the
arab
stand
in
ani
parti
or
a
ani
parti
is
sole
depend
upon
the
amount
of
polit
power
they
can
wield
effect
it
is
not
a
question
of
an

a
cabinet
post
and
that
arab
is
reject
but
the
posit
is
given
to
a
jew
from
the

we
are
not
talk
about
power
but
racism

even
when
they
do
the
thing
you
