if

just
such

perhap
you
think
that

would
you
like
to
provid
me
with
an
assur
that
thi
practis
never
occur
if
you
examin
these
i
am
sure
you
will
discov
that
the
arab
parti
member
did
not
have
the
power
base
that
hi
jewish
counterpart
had
right
arab
have
been
vote
in
israel
for
how
long
and
in
all
that
time
not
one
arab
ever
gain
enough
of
a
person
follow
to
get
hi
fellow
parti
member
to
put
in
a
ministri
thi
is
about
a
like
a
sprout
wing
and
fli
to
rio
what
basi
do
you
have
for
explain
thi
odd
failur
you
seem
veri
confid
that
you
are
right
exactli
how
do
you
know
whi
are
you
sure
onc
again
if
for
argument
sake
all
the
arab
isra
were
to
vote
for
labor
at
the
next
elect
you
can
rest
assur
that
the
number
of
arab
mk
and
cabinet
member
would
increas
proportion
to
the
power
shift
exactli
what
basi
do
you
have
for
say
thi
when
the
labour
parti
ha
never
put
an
arab
into
a
cabinet
post
and
insist
it
coalit
member
do
the
same
whi
and
on
what
basi
are
you
reassur
me
in
the
face
of
year
of
discriminatori
practis
you
are
overlook
the
fact
that
they
wield
polit
power
a
individu
base
upon
a
wider
collect
power
base
hey
what
a
i
said
even
when
their
parti
put
them
up
they
get
knock
back
it
sure
couldnt
be
becaus
they
are
arab
is
it
the
reason
i
see
at
work
is
pure
polit
a
far

goe
i
think
that
some
seriou
gaff
were
made
by

but
secur
is
the

most
often
given

the

probabl
forego
