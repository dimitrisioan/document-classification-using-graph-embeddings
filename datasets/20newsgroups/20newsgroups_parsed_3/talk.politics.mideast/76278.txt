entiti
tim
later
comment
there
seem
to
be
two
percept
that
have
to
be
address
the
first
is
that
of
israel
where
there
is
littl
trust
for
arab
group
so
there
is
littl
support
for
israel
give
up
tangibl
asset
in
exchang
for
piec
of
paper
expect
hope
etc
the
second
is
that
of
the
arab
worldpalestinian
where
there
is
the
demand
that
these
tangibl
concess
be
made
by
israel
without
it
receiv
anyth
tangibl
back
given
thi
the
gap
between
the
two
stanc
seem
to
be
the
need
by
israel
of
receiv
some
tangibl
return
for
it
expect
concess
by
tangibl
is
meant
someth
that
provid
israel
with
compar
protect
from
the
land
it
is
to
give
up
in
some
way
ensur
that
the
arab
state
and
palestin
will
be
account
and
held
activ
not
just
diplomat
respons
for
the
uphold
of
all
action
on
it
territori
by
citizen
or
visitor
israel
is
hang
on
larg
becaus
it
is
scare
stiff
that
the
minut
it
let
go
give
land
back
to
arab
state
no
more
buffer
zone
give
full
autonomi
to
palestinian

andor
all
of
the
arab
parti
could
and
would
if
not
control
somehow
easili
return

the
question
then
is
how
