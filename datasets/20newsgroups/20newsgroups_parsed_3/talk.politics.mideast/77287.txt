bosnia
may
th
michael
sell
write
thi
is
not
a
fresh
case
of
ethnic
clean
but
just
anoth
chapter
in
the
continu
saga
of
intens
mutual
hatr
destruct
everi
place
on
earth
is
the
scene
of
a
saga
of
mutual
hatr
and
destruct
the
holocaust
wa
not
a
fresh
case
it
wa
anoth
chapter
in
a
year
histori
of
attack
on
jew
in
europ
that
didnt
make
it
accept
and
balkan
histori
doe
not
make
the
genocid
against
bosnian
muslim
accept
i
guess
that
it
wa
not
accept
becaus
germani
also
chose
a
path
of
aggress
simultan
that
put
the
interest
of
other
countri
in
peril
i
wonder
whether
u
or
other
countri
would
have
risk
themselv
if
onli
jew
were
persecut
and
hitler
had
no
imperialist
ambit
i
am
no
student
of
histori
and
i
am
just
ask
question
if
even
for
a
moment
you
think
that
i
am
condo
ethnic
motiv
violenc
and
kill
you
are
dead
wrong
let
me
assur
i
am
not
my
onli
question
is
thi
do
power
countri
have
a
moral
oblig
to
interefer
in
other
countri
if
their
own
interest
are
not
threaten
i
cite
an
essay
by
charl
krauthamm
in
the
time
thi
week
that
discus
thi
issu
eloqu
for
exampl
did
u
and
other
european
countri
abandon
their
moral
compunct
when
they
chose
not
to
send
militari
troop
to
bombay
when
hindu
in
a
rare
fit
of
impass
rage
kill
mani
muslim
recent
i
think
not
under
what
condit
should
u
interfer
in
foregin
countri
is
an
abstract
one
must
clarifi
befor
resort
to
