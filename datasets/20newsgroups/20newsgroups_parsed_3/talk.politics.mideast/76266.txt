her
around
but
we
realli

but
i
do
know
that
that
guy
who

to
chernobyl
and
work
there
for
eight

from
our
balconi
how
the
neighbor
on
the
left
and
right
ran
into
the
apart
and
carri
off
everyth
that
hadnt
alreadi
been
smash
or
taken
what
is
one
to
think
of
that
it
mean
that
the
parent
in
those
famili
were
in
on
it
too
unfortun
i
came
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
wa
all
organ
and
that
everyth
had
been
foreseen
in
advanc
both
the
beat
of
the
armenian
and
the
strip
of
apart
someth
on
the
order
of
well
move
the
armenian
out
and
take
over
their
apart
i
have
work
honestli
my
whole
life
you
can
check
everyth
about
me
i
came
a
a
patriot
from
china
wait
for
night
on
end
in
front
of
the
consul
gener
of
the
ussr
i
came
to
my
homeland
a
a
patriot
becaus
i
knew
that
the
parti
and
the
komsomol
were
holi
thing
but
when
i
saw
in
sumgait
that
there
wasnt
anyth
holi
about
them
that
parti
membership
wa
bought
that
komsomol
member
join
onli
for
person
gain
that
there
were
no
ideal
no
idea
god
save
me
everyth
wa
be
bought
and
sold
i
saw
all
of
it
and
understood
how
they
could
allow
that
crap
to
go
on
like
it
did
i
cant
talk
ani
more
about
it
the
imag
of
that
beat
when
i
went
out
of
my
own
apartmentthey
pick
u
up
under
soviet
armi
guard
they
had
arriv
from
all
over
to
suppress
that
gangnot
onli
armenian
but
some
russian
famili
and
their
child
too
came
out
of
their
apart
and
join
u
becaus
no
normal
person
who
had
seen
that
could
stay
there
with
the
situat
the
way
it
wa
and
what
interest
is
that
when
we
left
on
the
buse
i
rode
and
thought
that
at
least
one
group
of
peopl
for
sure
peopl
would
basic
rise
to
the
situat
would
have
some
compass
for
the
armenian
would
somehow
understand
the
injustic
of
what
wa
done
but
have
analyz
and
weigh
the
whole
thing
onc
i
calm
down
have
thought
it
all
through
i
came
to
a
conclus
that
is
share
by
mani
peopl
if
a
lot
of
azerbaijani
didnt
want
their
armenian
neighbor
to
be
kill
and
that
basic
depend
on
that
muslimzadeh
said
that
he
had
want
to
calm
them
downthen
is
it
possibl
that
he
didnt
have
peopl
at
hand
to
whom
he
could
whisper
at
the
last
minut
go
and
announc
it
on
televis
citizen
of
sumgait
take
what
you
can
into
your
hand
let
protect
our
neighbor
from
thi
massacr
those
crowd
werent
such
that
there
wa
no
control
them
basic
they
were
unarm
they
didnt
have
firearm
mostli
they
had
knive
they
had
all
kind
of
metal
part
like
armatur
shaft
sharpen
at
the
end
special
rock
differ
to
a
degre
that
we
notic
them
there
arent
rock
like
those
in
sumgait
soil
they
were
brought
from
somewher
a
though
it
were
all
special
plan
so
a
i
wa
say
i
weigh
it
all
out
and
if
ani
of
our
neighbor
had
want
to
defend
u
whi
wasnt
it
arrang
it
mean
that
the
govern
didnt
want
to
do

the
upshot
is
that
thi
republ
ha
not

control
for
a
long
time
but
no
one
want
to
pay
ani
attent
or
get
involv
if
you
were
to
go
and
ask
at
my
work
mani

ive
been
struggl
for

a
demagogu
other
who
know
what
some
think
im
an
adventur
seeker
and
some
a
prankster
but
i
want
everyth
to
be
right
i
would
becom
outrag
how
can
thi
be
whi
is
it
peopl
treat
one
anoth
thi
way
on
a
soviet
railroad
a
though
the
azerbaijani

most
brazen
way
a

be
kick
and
drag
wa
in
that
hospit
too
a
it
turn
out
she
wa
brought
there
in
seriou
condit
but
at
least
she
wa
aliv
at
the
time
when
we
got
to
the
sk
club
we
would
see
first
one
friend
and
then
anoth
throw
ourselv
into
their
arm
and
kiss
them
becaus
you
had
wonder
if
these
friend
were
aliv
or
not
if
those
friend
were
aliv
or
not
and
when
you
saw
them
you
were
so
glad
to
find
out
that
the
famili
had
live
when
you
saw
peopl
you
heard
thing
that
made
your
hair
stand
on
end
if
you
publish
everyth
that
happen
it
will
be
a
hideou
book
a
book
of
thing
it
is
even
difficult
to
believ
and
those
two
girl
who
were
rape
were
entir
black
and
blue
the
one
at
the
sk
they
know
im
not
lie
that
girlfriend
came
up
to
one
of
them
and
said
what
happen
and
she
bare
her
breast
and
they
were
complet
cover
in
cigarett
burn
those
rogu
had
put
cigarett
out
on
her
breast
after
someth
like
that
i
dont
know
how
you
can
live
in
a
citi
and
look
at
the
peopl
in
it
now
when
we
stay
at
the
militari
unit
for
a
while
they
provid
well
basic
condit
for
u
there
the
militari
unit
is
locat
in
nasosni
some
six
mile
from
sumgait
and
live
there
we
met
with
a
larger
group
of
peopl
there
were
about
peopl
at
the
unit
you
know
there
wa
a
point
when
i
couldnt
even
go
outsid
becaus
if
you
went
outsid
you
saw
so
much
heartbreak
around
you
and
when
you
hear
the
fals
rumor
ye
by
the
way
fals
rumor
were
spread
in
sumgait
say
that
the
armenian
around
yerevan
had
destroy
azerbaijani
villag
and
raze
them
to
the
ground
with
bulldoz
i
didnt
know
whether
to
believ
it
or
not
and
peopl
who
dont
know
ani
better
get
the
idea
that
it
wa
all
done
in
reveng
but
when
i
arriv
in
armenia
and
wa
in
spitak
and
in
spitak
all
those
villag
are
not
onli
intact
but
at
that
time
had
even
been
protect
just
in
case
they
were
guard
they
got
better
food
than
did
the
inhabit
of
spitak
not
a
singl
person
there
die
and
no
one
is
plan
to
harm
them
around
yerevan
all
the
villag
are
safe
and
unharm
and
the
armenian
didnt
attack
anyon
but
actual
after
an
evil
of
the
magnitud
suffer
in
sumgait
there
could
have
been
a
feel
of
veng
but
no
one
act
on
it
and
i
dont
know
whi
you
sometim
hear
accus
to
the
effect
that
the
armenian
are
guilti
that
it
is
they
who
organ
it
rumor
like
that
are
be
spread
in
azerbaijan
and
if
one
old
person
say
it
and
ten
young
one
hear
it
they
not
onli
perceiv
it
with
their
mind
but
with
their
heart
too
to
them
it
seem
that
the
older
person
is
tell
the
truth
for
exampl
one
say
did
you
know
that
out
of
peopl
kill
