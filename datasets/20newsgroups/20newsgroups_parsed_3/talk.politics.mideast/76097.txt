it
is
not
a
terrorist
camp
a
you
and
the
isra
like
to
view
the
villag
they
are
small
commun
with
kid
play
soccer
in
the
street
woman
prepar
lunch
men
play
card
etc
i
would
not
argu
that
all
or
even
most
of
the
villag
are
terrorist
camp
there
are
howev
some
which
come
veri
close
to
serv
that
purpos
and
that
is
not
to
say
that
other
did
not
function
in
that
way
prior
to
the
invas
the
villag
i
describ
wa
actual
the
closest
i
could
come
to
describ
mine
i
agre
there
may
be
other
villag
where
the
civilian
popul
ha
desert
becaus
it
is
too
close
to
isra
line
and
thu
get
bomb
more
often
in
such
villag
often
the
onli
remain
inhabit
are
guerilla
and
some
elderli
who
have
nowher
el
to
go
but
for
the
most
part
the
typic
south
lebanon
villag
is
more
like
mine
one
where
civilian
and
guerilla
live
togeth
they
are
often
inhabit
the
same
hous
mani
famili
are
larg
some
have
member
of
the
famili
involv
in
hizollah
most
other
are
not
that
is
what
is
so
hard
of
south
lebanon
israel
is
not
fight
an
armi
with
well
drawn
battl
line
but
a
guerilla
tyoe
resist
which
by
definit
and
necess
blend
with
the
local
populac
not
becaus
they
are
evil
coward
that
use
woman
and
child
a
shield
but
becaus
that
is
the
onli
way
one
can
fight
a
more
power
better
equip
occupi
armi
some
of
the
villag
and
your
might
well
be
among
them
are
a
you
describ
not
all
are
there
are
a
larg
number
of
group
in
the
area
back
by
variou
organ
with
a
wide
rang
of
purpos
hizbollah
and
amal
were
two
of
the
larger
one
and
may
still
be
hizbollah
and
amal
are
now
the
main
two
militia
though
hizbollah
peopl
tend
to
be
more
commit
to
resistr
oper
and
better
motiv
by
religi
convict
a
to
retali
while
mistak
may
be
made
that
is
still
a
far
cri
from
indiscrimin
bomb
which
would
have
produc
major
casualti
it
may
be
a
mixtur
of
what
we
both
say
sometim
israel
choos
it
target
care
at
other
time
it
just
send
it
pilot
on
sorti
aim
at
a
town
in
gener
sinc
it
onli
know
that
the
attack
came
from
that
specif
villag
but
ha
no
further
intellig
on
sever
occas
israel
retalli
against
civilian
refuge
camp
even
in
north
lebanon
just
to
show
that
it
will
not
sit
idli
after
it
soldier
have
been
attack
most
of
the
time
it
direct
the
sla
to
do
the
dirti
work
and
indiscrimin
shell
some
lebanes
villag
on
the
other
side
i
have
experienc
thi
shell
myself
on
sever
occas
thi
is
whi
the
sla
militia
is
sometim
even
more
despis
than
isra
troop
well
here
we
disagre
i
think
that
israel
would
willingli
withdraw
if
the
lebanes
govt
wa
abl
to
field
a
reliabl
forc
in
the
area
to
polic
it
and
prevent
further
attack
i
hope
you
are
right
on
isra
willing
to
withdraw
but
i
still
contend
that
withdraw
would
be
the
better
cours
for
israel
secur
sinc
it
would
reduc
it
militari
loss
and
i
claim
that
the
lebanes
and
syrian
govt
would
be
abl
to
prevent
ani
further
attack
on
northern
israel
there
seem
to
be
veri
littl
incent
for
the
syrian
and
lebanes
goovern
to
allow
hizbollah
to
bomb
israel
proper
under
such
circumst
and
now
the
lebanes
govern
ha
proven
that
it
is
capabl
of
control
and
disarm
all
militia
a
they
did
in
all
other
part
of
lebanon
no
the
syrian
govt
is
more
than
happi
to
have
israel
sink
into
anoth
lebanes
morass
i
could
elabor
if
necessari
hmm
here
we
disagre
on
what
serv
syria
interest
better
i
think
syria
want
to
have
lebanon
all
to
itself
it
would
be
will
to
guarante
northern
israel
secur
in
return
for
isra
withdraw
i
dont
think
syria
want
israel
to
be
involv
in
it
protector
of
lebanon
syria
is
sit
at
the
negoti
tabl
becaus
it
ha
come
to
accept
that
and
want
to
get
a
polit
resolut
a
renew
of
hostil
along
the
lebanes
front
could
put
the
whole
me
peac
negoti
back
in
question
i
agre
onli
in
the
case
of
the
isar
soldier
their
kill
can
not
be
qualifi
a
murder
no
matter
what
you
say
no
but
it
is
regret
a
is
the
whole
situat
i
agre
that
the
