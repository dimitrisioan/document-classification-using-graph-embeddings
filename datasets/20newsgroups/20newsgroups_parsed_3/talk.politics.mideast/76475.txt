if

of
news
around
the
world
it
would
seem
that
israel
is
be
treat
unfairli
luckili
that
is
not
the
case
i
suggest
read
european
paper
rather
than
isra
propaganda
arab
paper
wouldnt
hurt
either
to
see
the
propaganda
of
the
other
side
anyway
you
are
an

within

just
dont

im
unclear
here
are
you
say
that
these

a
you

neither

outrag
at

of

list
i
retain
those
that
reflect
polici
of
murder
and

is
that
an
irrelev
fact
to
you
while
i
do
expect
israel

polici
to
be
condemn

i
have
to

i
think
thi
is
the
first
time
there
ha
been
someth
post
that
oppos
me
without
make

congradul
tim
i
think
the
other
peopl
answer
you
on
most
of
the
factual
partsesp
about
the
intern
conflict
polici
israel
veri
often
get
away
with
more
than
most
other
nation
due
to
u
veto
while
i
am
not
familiar
with
everi
instanc
i
know
that
the
reason
saudi
arabia
wa
not
condemn
for
killig
the
pilgrim
wa
that
the
pilgrim
were
iranian
ye
the
un
is
bias
but
mostli
in
favor
of
the
u
and
it
alli
includ
israel
saudi
arabia
and
pakistan
and
against
outlaw
countri
like
iran
and
more
recent
iraq
far
be
it
from
me
to
support
the
repress
govern
there
but
i
think
they
get
more
slack
than
israel
for
thing
they
do
wrong
again
the
reason
some
condemn
dont
occur
lie
in
the
race
or
countri
of
the
victim
the
gass
iraqi
kurd
got
associ
with
iran
in
the
war
and
sinc
iran
wa
perceiv
a
wors
than
iraq
no
condemn
result
the
palestinian
kill
by
arab
countri
involv
anoth
case
of
who
care
it
seem
that
until
veri
recent
no
one
care
about
how
mani
palestinian
die
anywher
includ
in
israel
and
the
occupi
territori
again
i
appreci
the
lack
of
