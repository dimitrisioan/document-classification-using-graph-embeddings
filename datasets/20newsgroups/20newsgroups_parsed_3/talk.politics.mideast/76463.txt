my
view
is
that
israel
ha
made
more
gestur
toward
it
arab
foe

the
opposit
what
have
the
sysrian
given
to

have
the
palestinian
propos
if
the
palestinian
would
just
revok
or
rewrit
their
charter
or
just
condemn
act
of
palestinian
violenc
that
would
be
a
good
start
the
palestinian
have
all
to
gain
from
these
negoti
it
seem
though
that
they
are
not
strong
enough
to
make
decis
on
their
own
and
are
plagu
by
intern
strife
that
is
whi
we
