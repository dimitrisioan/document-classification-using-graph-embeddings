let

later
w
no
object
from
the
un
similarli
the
peopl
of
algeria

islam
fundemantalist
parti
into
power
but
the
junta
declar
it
illeg
in
both
case
i
person
have
no

outcom
but
if
the
voic

is
that
hallow
thing
that
the

whi
isnt

interf
there
the

wish
to
they
are
in
the
perfect
right
to
help
them
without
ani
whine
from
thir
parti
after
all
if
it
turn
out
to
be
coloni
and
the
poepl
dont
like
it
they
find
a
way
to
throw
them
out
exactli
my
point
is
that
it
will
inevit
turn
out
that
way
and
we
can
save
ourselv
a
lot
of
pain
and
troubl
by
simpli
let
peopl
sort
out
their
problem
on
their
own
coloni
intervent
even
in
haiti
havent
work
in
the
past
they
had
a
coup
from
the
u
invad
in
and
left
in
almost
year
after
they
had
intend
to
wa
it
a
success
well
look
at
haiti
today
and
of
the
past
year
and
decid
for
yourself
it
wa
a
success
so
long
a
the
u
wa
in
from
what
i
rememb
but
it
didnt
last
long
obvious
there
is
an
implicit
assumpt
here
that
we
a
outsid
have
a
right
to
sit
in
judgement
of
anoth
peopl
and
to
then
act
on
it
to
me
it
is
in
there
that
the
root
of
old
coloni
attitud
lie
today
the
motif
are
nobl
tomorrow
they
may
not
be
who
ever
said
peopl
who
commit
genocid
have
the
right
to
commit
genocid
nobodi
did
peopl
should
have
a
right
to
selfdefens
if
the
un
want
to
arm
the
bosnian
or
haitian
revolutionari
or
whoever
i
have
no
problem
with
that
i
do
when
they
cross
that
line
and
attempt
to
rearrang
boundari
govt
etc
the
vanceowen
plan
be
one
such
piec
of
insan
i
want
a
world
where
crimin
again
human
have
no
place
to
hide
while
you
want
special
sovereignti
design
to
protect
them
nobodi
ha
the
right
to
commit
crime
against
human
and
if
they
do
they
loos
all
right
to
self
determin
if
thi
is
classic
coloni
then
so
be
it
we
final
have
a
clearlyst
point
of
differ
coloni
can
have
it
good
side
which
is
a
you
state
abov
remov
thug
from
be
abl
to
lord
it
over
powerless
peopl
i
am
worri
that
the
bad
side
is
what
will
assert
itself
and
i
am
prepar
to
let
natur
forc
take
their
cours
if
that
will
mean
we
can
avoid
the
bad
side
of
coloni
sriniva
sunder
if
the
univers
of
illinoi
share
these
view
id
be
surpris
they
arent
