there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
whi
we
cant
say
that
take
view
analog
to
the
kkk
or
some
such
organ
is
wrong
there
is
no
reason
whi
some
moral
may
not
be
legisl
a
it
is
we
do
not
allow
theft
or
murder
or
rape
whi
should
we
allow
hate
sppech
whose
onli
purpos
is
to
stir
anger
and
violenc
harri
i
think
the
answer
to
mr
mayamski
question
can
be
found
in
the
mr
mamayski
first
amend
to
the
u
constitut
amend
i
congress
shall
make
no
law
respect
an
establish
of
religion
or
prohibit
the
free
exercis
thereof
or
abridg
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
peopl
peaceabl
to
assembl
and
to
petit
the
govern
for
a
redress
of
grievanc
steve
i
do
not
say
that
freedom
of
speech
should
be
ban
far
from
it
i
am
mere
suggest
that
there
are
certain
thing
which
can
be
univers
agre
to
be
moral
incorrect
there
are
not
mani
such
thing
but
there
are
some
a
an
exampl
murder
is
moral
incorrect
the
idea
that
one
group
of
peopl
is
somehow
racial
inferior
to
anoth
is
moral
incorrect
etc
the
point
is
that
ani
action
which
serv
to
promot
a
moral
incorrect
action
should
be
forbidden
thi
impli
that
no
one
ha
the
right
to
say
that
an
innoc
person
should
be
murder
regardless
of
freedom
of
speech
i
may
not
stand
on
a
street
corner
and
advoc
the
murder
of
innoc
peopl
the
reason
for
thi
is
that
murder
is
a
moral
incorrect
action
in
the
same
way
sinc
bigotri
is
moral
incorrect
in
the
narrow
definit
which
we
have
given
it
i
nor
ani
one
el
ha
the
right
to
stand
on
a
street
corner
and
promot
bigotri
such
an
enforc
doe
in
no
way
deni
ani
one
their
right
a
guarante
by
the
first
amend
it
mere
ensur
that
no
person
may
be
the
target
of
an
attempt
to
deni
him
a
fundament
moral
right
such
a
the
right
to
not
be
murder
and
the
right
not
to
be
discrimin
against
i
believ
mr
berson
that
to
blindli
accept
the
constitut
is
a
terrif
mistak
we
must
cinstantli
question
the
constitut
and
interpret
it
in
a
way
befit
the
societi
in
which
we
live
anyth
short
of
such
an
effort
would
render
u
littl
more
than

monkey
who
are
abl
to
mere
repeat
what
they
have
heard
without
