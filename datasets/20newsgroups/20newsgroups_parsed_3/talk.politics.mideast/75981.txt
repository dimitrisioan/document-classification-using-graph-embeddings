resist
even
the
inhabit

the
villag
do
not
know
who
these
are
they
are
secret
about
it
but
most
peopl
often
suspect
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
up
to
these
young
men
are
support
financi
by
iran
most
of
the
time
they
sneak
arm
and
ammunit
into
the
occupi

where
they
set
up
boobi
trap
for
isra
patrol
everi
time
an
isra

is
kill

injur
by
these
trap
israel
retalli
by
indiscrimin
bomb
villag
of
their
own
choos
often
kill
onli
innoc
civilian
thi
a
tri
and
true
method
util
by
guerilla
and
terrorist
group
to
conduct
oper
in
the
midst
of
the
local
populac
thu
forc
the
oppos
state
to
possibl
harm
innoc
civilian
in
their
search
or
in
order
to
avoid
the
death
of
civilian
abandon
the
search
certainli
the
peopl
who
use
the
popul
for
cover
are
also
to
blaim
for
drag
the
innoc
civilian
into
harm
way
are
you
suggest
that
when
guerilla
use
the
popul
for
cover
israel
should
total
back
down
soth
easiest
way
to
get
away
with
attack
anoth
is
to
use
an
innoc
a
a
shield
and
hope
that
the
other
respect
innoc
life
if
israel
insist
that
the
so
call
secur
zone
is
necessari
for
the
protect
of
northern
israel
than
it
will
have
to
pay
the
price
of
it
occup
with
the
blood
of
it
soldier
your
damn
right
israel
insist
on
some
sort
of
demilitar
or
buffer
zone
it
had
to
put
up
with
too
mani
year
of
attack
from
the
territori
of
arab
state
and
watch
a
the
state
did
noth
it
is
not
exactli
surpriz
that
israel
decid
that
the
onli
way
to
stop
such
action
is
to
do
it
themselv
if
israel
is
interest
in
peac
than
it
should
withdraw
from
our
land
what
so
the
whole
bit
about
attack
on
israel
from
neighbor
arab
state
can
start
all
over
again
while
i
also
hope
for
thi
to
happen
it
will
onli
occur
when
arab
state
show
that
they
are
prepar
to
take
on
the
respons
and
the
duti
to
stop
guerilla
attack
on
israel
from
their
soil
they
have
to
prove
it
or
provid
some
guarate
there
is
no
way
israel
is
go
to
accept
their
word
not
with
their
past
attitud
of
toler
toward
antiisrael
guerilla
inresid
i
have
written
befor
on
thi
veri
newsgroup
that
the
onli
real
solut
will
come
a
a
result
of
a
comprehens
peac
settlement
wherebi
israel
withdraw
to
it
own
border
and
peac
keep
troop
are
station
along
the
border
to
insur
no
one
on
either
side
of
the
border
is
shell
good
lord
brad
what
in
the
world
gove
you
the
idea
that
un
troop
stop
anyth
they
are
onli
station
in
a
countri
becaus
that
countri
allow
them
in
it
can
ask
them
to
leav
at
ani
time
a
nasser
did
in
and
somehow
with
that
limit
on
the
troop
power
i
dont
think
that
israel
is
go
to
be
ani
more
comfort
without
a
genuin
commit
to
peac
from
the
arab
state
and
concret
not
intellectu
or
polit
exercis
in
jargon
guarante
by
other
parti
the
un
is
worthless
to
israel
but
perhap
use
a
a
ruse
thi
is
the
onli
realist
solut
it
is
time
for
israel
to
realiz
that
the
concept
of
a
buffer
zone
aim
at
protect
it
northern
citi
ha
fail
in
fact
it
ha
caus
much
more
isra
death
than
the
occasion
shell
of
northern
israel
would
have
result
in
perhap
you
are
awar
that
to
most
commun
of
peopl
there
is
the
feel
that
it
is
better
that
mani
of
u
die
fight
against
those
who
attack
u
than
for
few
to
die
while
we
silent
accept
our
fate
ifhowev
you
call
on
israel
to
see
the
sens
of
suffer
fewer
casualti
i
suggest
you
appli
the
same
to
palestinian
arab
and
islam
group
if
israel
realli
want
to
save
some
isra
life
it
would
withdraw
unilater
from
the
socal
secur
zone
befor
the
conclus
of
the
peac
talk
such
a
move
would
save
isra
life
advanc
peac
effort
give
israel
a
great
moral
lift
better
israel
public
imag
abroad
and
give
it
an

sinc
israel
can
rightli
claim
that
it
is

interest
in

and
ha
alreadi
offer
some
import
concess
along
with
such
a

israel
could
demand

be
disarm
by
the
lebanes
govern
and
warn
that
it
will
not
accept
ani
attack
against

that
if

occur

it
will
consid
retak
the

israel

what
would
israel
want

and
dont
be
so
idiot
a
to

and
most
state
dont

confort
base
their

and
now
the
lebanes
govern
ha
proven
that
it
is
capabl
of

disarm
all

a
they
did
in

lebanon
would
not

who
is
to

that
lebanon
will
be
