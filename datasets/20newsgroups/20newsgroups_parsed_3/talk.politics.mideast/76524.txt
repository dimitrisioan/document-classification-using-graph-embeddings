so
nice
of
you
all
to
answer
some
question
and
it
so
nice
that
most
of
you
feel
that
it
would
be
in
your
heart
to
give
the
palestinian
some
land
most
of
you
focu
on
the
fact
that
israel
annex
all
thi
land
and
it
is
a
kind
gestur
to
give
some
of
it
back
well
i
hope
that
after
after
a
state
run
by
palestinian
is
establish
the
first
decis
should
be
to
make
jerusalem
part
of
thi
state

if
the
isra
are
stupid
enough
to
allow
a
second
palestinian
state
the
first
one
is
jordon
then
you
will
probabl
get
your
wish
and
the
isra
would
get
what
come
to
them
howev
if
the
palestinian
were
to
somehow
demonstr
that
they
could
govern
themselv
and
live
in
peac
with
their
jewish
neighbor
then
they
would
have
to
give
up
the
idea
of
jerusalem
a
a
part
of
their
state
and
you
would
be
disappoint
israel
ha
not
annex
ani
of
the
west
bank
just
jeruselum
which
will
remain
part
