imagin
alan
h
stein
mr
waterhead
i
never
said
that
israel
divert
lebanes
river
in
fact
i
said
that
israel
went
into
southern
lebanon
to
make
sure
that
no
water
is
be
use
on
the
lebanes
side
so
that
all
water
would
run
into
jordan
river
where
there
israel
will
use
it
head
of
cours
post
some
hard
evid
or
fact
is
much
more
difficult
you
have
not
bother
to
substanti
thi
in
ani
way
basil
do
you
know
of
ani
evid
that
would
support
thi
i
can
just
imagin
a
news
report
from
ancient
time
if

irrepar
damag
to
the
environ
egyptian

said
that
thousand

heheh
btw
doe
the
litani
river
not
flow
west
and
not
south
i
think
that
it
