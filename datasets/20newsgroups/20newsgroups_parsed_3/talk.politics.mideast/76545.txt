such
bullshit
deir
yassin
wa
an
unprovok
attack
on
the
part
of
the
jew
and
a
massacr
defin
it
best
in
my
opinion
the
villag
of
deir
yassin
had
had
a
pact
with
the
jew
a
peac
pact
but
the
irgun
purpos
broke
thi
agreement
in
order
to
scare
off
the
palestinian
i
might
grant
that
thi
villag
hous
arm
arab
i
doubt
it
but
noth
in
the
archiv
and
avail
literatur
indic
that
thi
wa
a
motiv
forc
amongst
the
irgun
the
deir
yassin
massacr
wa
part
of
an
over
all
strategi
to
intimid
the
palestinian
to
flee
the
jewish
homelandand
contrari
to
your
belief
mani
civilian
were
kill
deir
yassin
wa
later
advert
by
the
veri
jew
who
perpetr
it
becaus
it
wa
use
in
get
mani
palestinian
to
leav
the
palestinian
were
right
scare
off
becaus
they
did
not
want
anoth
deir
yassin
im
not
necessarili
condemn
the
israelit
here
atroc
were
aslo
commit
on
the
part
of
the
arab
israelophil
should
just
be
care
in
think
that
they
are
and
were
the
good
guy
in
the
middl
east
both
arab
and
jew
suck
equal
rj
you
say
that
there
is
no
evid
that
what
motiv
the
irgun
to
attack
dir
yassin
wa
it
strateg
import
in
fact
begin
who
wa
in
charg
of
the
irgun
wrote
that
dir
yassin
wa
attack
for
it
militari
signific
dir
yassin
wa
mere
a
battl
in
the
war
of
liber
peopl
die
but
the
thing
wa
never
intend
to
be
a
masacr
that
thi
hapen
is
a
tragedi
of
war
not
a
crime
of
the
irgun
harri
i
agre
with
you
harri
howev
you
must
also
conced
then
that
arab
terror
is
also
a
tragedi
of
war
rememb
that
the
palestinian
have
no
other
effect
target
but
civilian
in
order
to
further
their
caus
if
irgun
had
to
attack
civilian
target
to
terror
in
order
that
they
might
obtain
some
object
im
sure
they
would
have
done
so
i
also
dont
exclud
irgun
action
against
british
soldier
a
terror
the
british
were
show
sign
of
favor
a
compromis
with
regard
to
palestin
and
the
irgun
and
branch
off
group
made
a
point
to
kill
young
british
recruit
so
that
mother
and
father
back
in
britain
would
get
angri
at
britain
continu
presenc
in
palestin
sound
like
a
form
of
terror
to
me
and
not
much
remov
from
arab
terror
we
must
not
also
forget
that
irgun
or
irgun
branch
off
group
more
like
kill
mani
jew
who
were
not
a
hardlin
zionist
a
they
or
who
cooper
with
the
british
ill
reiter
again
both
side
are
screwi
but
ill
favor
the
underdog
in
thi
case
becaus
i
do
think
they
were
a
bit
screw
