well
you
should
have
note
that
i
wa
cheer
an
attack
on
an
isra
patrol
insid
lebanes
territori
while
i
wa
condemn
the
retaliatori
shell
of
lebanes
villag
by
isra
and
israeliback
forc
my
team
you
see
wa
play
fair
while
the
oppos
team
wa
rearrang
the
face
of
the
spectat
in
my
team
view
stand
so
to
speak
i
think
that
you
should
tri
to
find
more
sourc
of
news
about
what
go
on
in
lebanon
and
tri
to
see
through
the
propaganda
there
are
no
a
priori
black
and
white
hat
but
one
sure
wonder
how
the
idf
can
bombard
villag
in
retali
to
pinpoint
attack
on
it
soldier
in
lebanon
and
then
call
the
lebanes
terrorist
if
the
attack
wa
justifi
or
not
is
at
least
debat
but
thi
is
not
the
issu
the
issu
is
that
you
were
cheer
death
dorin
dorin
of
all
the
critic
of
my
post
express
on
tpm
thi
one
i
accept
i
regret
that
aspect
of
my
post
it
is
my
hope
that
the
occup
will
end
and
the
accompani
loss
of
life
but
i
believ
that
stiff
resist
can
help
to
achiev
that
end
despit
what
some
have
said
on
tpm
i
think
that
there
is
a
point
when
loss
are
unaccept
the
strategi
drove
u
troop
out
of
lebanon
