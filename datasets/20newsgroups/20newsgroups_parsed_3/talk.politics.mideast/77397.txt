in
articl
eric
s
perlman
write
so
far
you
have
present
your
opinion
a
oppos
to
mine
i
would
hardli
take
them
a
fact
becaus
you
dont
agre
with
them
hmm
no
becaus
a
fact
and
an
opinion
are
two
differ
thing
what
you
are
express
here
are
opinion
not
fact
in
the
abstract
what
your
say
is
true
but
the
fact
happen
to
agre
with
me
and
disagre
complet
with
you
i
could
give
you
hundr
of
word
in
my
mother
tongu
spanish
that
are
comonli
use
and
you
will
never
find
in
a
dictionari
even
more
i
could
show
you
a
lot
of
mean
that
word
in
spanish
have
differ
from
those
in
the
dictionari
were
talk
about
the
latter
not
the
former
and
what
your
talk
about
is
slang
in
the
latter
that
clearli
ha
never
been
the
case
here
no
i
am
not
talk
about
slang
i
am
talk
about
differ
use
of
the
same
languag
in
differ
place
listen
pinka
im
go
to
count
on
the
supposit
that
you
think
through
the
opinion
you
have
someth
which
is
by
the
way
against
my
better
judgment
base
on
what
ive
seen
from
you
to
date
we
are
agre
arent
we
that
dictionari
are
refer
book
for
the
usag
of
a
given
languag
and
in
particular
for
the
mean
of
the
word
and
phrase
which
compris
that
languag
now
you
are
use
mean
complet
differ
from
inde
in
some
case
diametr
differ
from
those
given
in
the
dictionari
a
a
refer
book
a
dictionari
contain
those
mean
in
both
past
and
a
much
a
it
can
in
current
use
that
also
whi
they
are
updat
so
often
now
if
you
are
say
thing
which
you
give
differ
mean
than
the
dictionari
doe
and
use
nonstandard
mean
about
everi
word
what
is
your
chanc
of
be
taken
at
face
valu
just
about
none
just
about
no
one
will
take
you
that
way
becaus
the
word
mean
someth
differ
to
them
it
quit
clear
to
me
from
the
respons
thi
thread
ha
been
get
that
that
is
exactli
what
is
happen
ponder
that
and
guess
whi
isnt
it
curiou
that
we
do
not
know
how
mani
peopl
defin
in
how
mani
differ
way
the
term
jew
which
is
the
basi
of
the
movement
itself
no
probabl
becaus
the
question
hasnt
been
ask
gee
i
hate
it
when
peopl
draw
conclus
without
inform
dont
you
i
hate
peopl
who
can
not
read
i
did
not
draw
ani
conclus
i
just
said
that
it
is
curiou
consid
how
heterogen
the
movement
is
what
you
did
wa
ask
a
lead
question
in
english
idiom
the
phrase
and
guess
whi
in
the
way
you
use
it
is
a
load
question
with
onli
one
answer
expect
i
also
take
offens
at
be
told
i
can
not
read
by
someon
who
is
obvious
have
troubl
with
the
subject
himself
mr
pinka
i
am
a
phd
candid
in
my
field
one
doe
not
get
to
phd
candidaci
if
one
can
not
read
the
law
of
return
and
jewish
nation
is
defin
in
term
of
religion
and
not
of
cultur
ident
even
if
of
those
defin
a
jew
in
isreal
are
not
religi
for
the
umpteenth
time
it
is
not
defin
in
term
of
religion
thi
ha
been
proven
to
you
over
and
over
again
no
it
ha
not
the
law
of
return
defin
a
jew
a
someon
who
ha
a
jewish
mother
and
ha
not
convert
to
anoth
religion
that
is
pretti
the
same
a
the
religi
definit
that
is
a
problem
i
am
say
that
i
do
not
support
zionism
a
it
is
now
i
believ
that
among
the
peopl
in
the
soviet
communist
parti
some
might
even
had
been
inspir
by
nobl
ideal
doe
that
chang
the
final
result
of
what
happen
in
the
ussr
are
you
now
wish
to
compar
the
ussr
and
israel
or
what
israel
doe
not
practic
cruelti
now
i
understand
you
are
unabl
to
make
abstract
you
can
not
get
the
idea
from
a
text
and
you
take
everyth
liter
bad
thing
balderdash
you
know
thi
is
fals
i
would
be
abl
to
make
the
abstract
if
it
bore
ani
resembl
to
the
fact
of
the
matter
your
did
not
the
analog
is
utterli
inapplic
i
wouldnt
be
in
the
field
im
in
astrophys
if
i
couldnt
make
abstract
and
specul
about
the
gener
grand
scheme
of
thing
i
also
wouldnt
be
in
educ
which
i
am
and
my
student
give
me
rather
good
review
id
add
if
i
couldnt
draw
such
analog
about
israel
not
practic
cruelti
ask
those
palestinian
in
isra
prison
those
who
were
tortur
those
whose
hous
had
been
blown
by
the
armi
the
vast
major
of
palestinian
in
isra
prison
arent
tortur
and
their
hous
werent
blown
up
by
the
armi
in
fact

measur
on
thi
net
befor
are
you
now
tri
to
intim
my
agreement
with
them
i
never
said
it
directli
nor
indirectli
i
am
not
talk
about
individu
who
defin
themselv
a
zionist
here
i
am
sure
most
of
them
are
good
honest
and
care
peopl
i
am
talk
about
the
result
of
the
zionist
movement
in
other
word
you
are
take
that
a
a
monolith
and
ignor
the
dissens
within
it
disagr
that
is
express
freeli
and
is
wide
base
just
a
bad
can
you
read
or
are
you
just
type
at
random
do
you
know
the
mean
of
the
word
you
use
or
do
you
expect
the
reader
to
read
your
mind
i
can
read
just
fine
thank
you
and
i
dont
need
someon
who
is
obvious
have
some
troubl
with
a
tongu
which
isnt
hi
nativ
one
tell
me
how
to
read
the
word
in
my
own
nativ
tongu
if
it
were
spanish
id
ask
you
i
am
talk
about
a
movement
whose
action
result
in
a
law
of
return
with
a
religi
definit
of
jew
a
countri
that
defin
nation
base
on
religion
then
your
not
talk
about
the
movement
a
it
exist
today
a
ive
been
tri
to
tell
you
plea
read
the
argument
ive
given
you
if
you
can
still
say
thi
after
read
them
you
need
to
read
them
again
i
am
talk
about
someth
i
consid
a
form
of
racism
such
a
differenci
base
on
religi
belief
after
all
if
arab
in
israel
can
not
serv
in
the
armi
is
becasu
they
were
not
born
in
the
right
religion
arab
in
israel
not
onli
can
but
do
serv
in
the
idf
a
you
well
know
they
can
serv
it
is
true
but
they
are
not
allow
to
do
the
all
the
same
thing
a
the
isra
citizen
who
happen
to
be
jew
ye
they
are
a
you
well
know
ok
fine
now
we
know
what
your
talk
about
but
do
you
see
my
point
about
how
your
word
could
easili
have
been
taken
differ
it
is
not
we
it
wa
you
a
in
the
second
person
in
singular
who
can
not
understand
a
text
if
thing
are
not
explicitli
said
balderdash
see
abov
onc
again
you
have
a
lot
of
gall
and
absolut
no
right
to
lectur
a
nativ
speaker
of
a
languag
who
is
well
educ
in
it
in
a
languag
which
isnt
your
own
nativ
tongu
and
with
which
your
obvious
have
problem
so
there
is
no
differ
between
citizenship
and
nation
in
israel
or
what
do
you
mean
by
actual
it
doesnt
i
mean
exactli
that
arab
and
jewish
citizen
of
israel
have
the
same
right
if
there
is
no
differ
between
them
whi
keep
them
in
id
better
yet
are
you
go
to
tell
me
that
there
are
no
differ
in
social
life
between
arab
and
jew
social
life
is
one
thing
legal
statu
is
anoth
onc
again
thi
is
a
lead
question
so
it
follow
a
religi
definit
and
not
a
cultur
one
that
is
what
i
call
a
form
of
racism
no
becaus
the
jewish
religion
and
cultur
are
intim
insepar
intertwin
if
one
renounc
judaism
one
renounc
judaism
i
do
not
believ
that
thi
is
true
final
question
is
it
possibl
to
be
both
jewish
and
muslim
jewish
and
christian

respons
will

how
sad
