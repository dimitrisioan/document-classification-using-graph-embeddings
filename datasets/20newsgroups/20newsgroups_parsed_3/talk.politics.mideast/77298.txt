while
a
war
rage
between
serb
and
croat
a
a
continu
of
wwii
and
older
agenda
the
annihil
of
islam
and
muslim
from
bosnian
is
be
carri
out
under
the
cover
of
the
serbocroat
war
the
annihil
of
islam
turk
is
an
older
serbian
agenda
but
i
strongli
disput
your
notion
that
croat
had
a
similar
older
agenda
in
fact
for
the
past
centuri
or
two
croat
and
muslim
have
seen
themselv
a
have
a
lot
in
common
and
they
gener
had
friendli
relat
your
suggest
that
croatmuslim
relationship
is
anyth
like
serbmuslim
relationship
is
complet
wrong
to
say
that
croat
and
muslim
have
a
lot
in
common
doe
not
impli
they
are
not
separ
peopl
the
event
of
the
past
two
year
clearli
show
muslim
determin
to
remain
separ
in
their
allianc
with
croat
they
maintain
thi
separ
croat
would
have
accept
a
much
closer
relationship
i
think
thi
centuri
plu
of
build
bridg
between
these
two
friendli
peopl
is
now
at
risk
becaus
of
the
inexor
logic
of
war
sinc
bosnian
serb
of
popul
have
time
more
heavi
weapon
than
bosnian
muslim
and
croat
combin
they
have
squeez
muslim
and
croat
into
onli
of
the
territori
muslim
lost
more
territori
than
croat
who
built
defens
earli
on
under
these
condit
ani
allianc
is
bound
to
fall
apart
sinc
it
is
easier
to
recov
lost
land
from
croat
than
from
serb
the
onli
thing
keep
thi
in
check
wa
the
hope
of
revers
of
fortun
through
foreign
militari
intervent
and
lift
of
the

sinc
warren

had
no

persuad
the

to
go
along
with
thi

have
no
prospect
of

the

turn
on
each
other
like
two

thi
inexor

of

who
were
do
everyth
to
build
mistrust
between
croat

muslim
for
over
a

a

intervent

even
among

thi
is
tragic
but
hardli
new
divid

wa
use
by
ancient

in
my
view
bosnian

reason
well
until

i
have
a

do
they
believ
balkan
peopl
are

cannon
fodder
id
like
to
know
what
did
they
expect
when
they
decid
to
enforc
the

embargo
which
solidifi
serbian
advantag
in
heavi
weapon
how
did
they
expect
to
prevent
fragment
of
the
muslim

croat
defens
forc
and
how
on

do
they
hope
to
restor
peac
without

the

thi

i
