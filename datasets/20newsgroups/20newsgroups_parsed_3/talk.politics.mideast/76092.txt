write
tell
me
do
these
young
men
also
attack
syrian
troop
in
the
south
lebanon
area
onli
isra
and
sla
and
lebanes
troop
are
present
syrian
troop
are
deploy
north
of
the
awali
river
between
the
awali
river
and
the
secur
zone
onli
lebanes
troop
are
station
with
the
blood
of
it
soldier
if
israel
is
interest
in
peac
than
it
should
withdraw
from
our
land
there
must
be
a
guarante
of
peac
befor
thi
happen
it
seem
that
mani
of
these
lebanes
youth
are
unabl
to
restrain
themselv
from
violenc
and
unabl
to
to
realiz
that
their
action
prolong
israel
stay
in
south
lebanon
that
is
your
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
isra
govern
i
agre
peac
guarante
would
be
better
for
all
but
i
am
address
the
problem
a
it
stand
now
hope
a
comprehens
peac
settlement
will
be
conclud
soon
and
will
includ
secur
guarante
for
both
side
my
propos
wa
aim
at
decreas
the
casualti
in
the
interim
period
in
my
opinion
if
israel
withdraw
unilater
it
would
still
be
better
off
than
stay
the
isra
govt
obvious
agre
with
you
and
is
not
will
to
do
such
a
move
i
hope
to
be
be
abl
to
chang
your
opinion
and
their
that
whi
i
post
to
tpm
if
the
lebanes
armi
wa
abl
to
maintain
the
peac
then
israel
would
not
have
to
be
there
until
it
is
israel
prefer
that
it
soldier
die
rather
than
it
child
a
i
explain
i
contend
that
if
israel
doe
withdraw
unilater
i
believ
no
attack
would
ensu
against
northern
israel
i
also
explain
whi
i
believ
that
to
be
the
case
my
suggest
is
aim
at
reduc
the
level
of
tension
and
casualti
on
all
side
it
is
unfortun
that
israel
doe
not
agre
with
my
opinion
if
israel
realli
want
to
save
some
isra
life
it
would
withdraw
unilater
from
the
socal
secur
zone
befor
the
conclus
of
the
peac
talk
such
a
move
would
save
isra
life
advanc
peac
effort
give
israel
a
great
moral
lift
better
israel
public
imag
abroad
and
give
it
an
edg
in
the
peac
negoci
sinc
israel
can
rightli
claim
that
it
is
genuin
interest
in
peac
and
ha
alreadi
offer
some
import
concess
israel
should
withdraw
from
lebanon
when
a
peac
treati
is
sign
not
a
day
befor
withdraw
becaus
of
casualti
would
tell
the
lebanes
peopl
that
all
they
need
to
do
to
push
israel
around
is
kill
a
few
soldier
it
not
gon
na
happen
that
is
too
bad
along
with
such
a
withdraw
israel
could
demand
that
hizbollah
be
disarm
by
the
lebanes
govern
and
warn
that
it
will
not
accept
ani
attack
against
it
northern
citi
and
that
if
such
a
shell
occur
than
it
will
consid
retak
the
buffer
zone
and
will
hold
the
lebanes
and
syrian
govern
respons
for
it
whi
should
israel
not
demand
thi
while
hold
the
buffer
zone
it
seem
to
me
that
the
better
bargain
posit
is
while
hold
your
neighbor
land
becaus
israel
is
not
occupi
the
secur
zone
free
of
charg
it
is
pay
the
price
for
that
onc
israel
withdraw
it
may
have
lost
a
bargain
chip
at
the
negoci
tabl
but
it
would
save
some
soldier
life
that
is
my
content
if
lebanon
were
will
to
agre
to
those
condit
israel
would
quit
probabl
have
left
alreadi
unfortun
it
doesnt
seem
that
the
lebanes
can
disarm
the
hizbolah
and
maintain
the
peac
that
is
complet
untru
hizbollah
is
now
a
minor
forc
in
lebanes
polit
the
real
heavi
weight
are
syria
alli
the
govt
is
support
by
syria
the
lebanes
armi
is
over
troop
and
unifi
like
never
befor
hizbollah
can
have
no
moral
justif
in
attack
israel
proper
especi
after
isra
withdraw
that
would
draw
the
ire
of
the
lebanes
the
syrian
and
the
isra
govt
if
israel
doe
withdraw
and
such
an
act
hizbolllah
attack
israel
would
be
akin
to
polit
and
moral
suicid
basil
adam

shostack
if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for

sexual
