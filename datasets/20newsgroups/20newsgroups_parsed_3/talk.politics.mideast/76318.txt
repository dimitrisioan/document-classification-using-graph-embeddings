without
notifi
their
tenant
farmer
and
for
not
be
respons
enough
to
make
provis
for
them
but
rather
just
leav
them
to
their
fate
if
a
landlord
sell
an
apart
build
vacant
to
anoth
landlord
and
fail
to
notifi
hi

they
just
might
find
themselv
out
on
the
street
all
of
a
sudden
the
seller
may
be
a
scoundrel
and
a
crook
but
thi
doesnt
make
the

a
thief
a
isra
are
so
often
call
here
on
tpm
it
is
interest
though
that
you

that
the
palestinian

shaft
do
mani
isra
or
jew
share
your
opinion
do
you
absolv
the

ani
ethic
commit
just
becaus
it
wasnt
written
down
i
dont
know
if

share
thi
opinion
it
is
mine
and
im
sure
there
are
some
who
agre
and
some
who
dont
the
way
i
see
it
the
fallahin
were
caught
in
circumst
beyond
their
control
in
that
sinc
they
didnt
own
the
land
they
didnt
have
a
say
of
cours
now
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
arab
uniti
the
arab
are
angri
that
the
land
wa
sold
to
the
jew
an
act
that
is
illeg
in
jordan
but
when
it
happen
it
wa
just
busi
the
arab
that
live
along
the
coast
in
western
palestin
later
to
be
call
israel
were
shaft
by
their
brother
arab
just
a
theyv
been
shaft
for
decad
sinc
then
by
their
arab
bretheren
somehow
though
the
arab
call
ha
continu
to
blame
israel
not
onli
for
the
syrian
landown
sellout
in
western
palestin
israel
but
even
for
the
occup
of
eastern
palestin
jordan
by
the
hashemit
thi
is
just
more
of
refus
to
take
blame
for
one
own
action
infrastructur
etc
imho
the
palestinian
have
ground
to
contest
the
legal
of
