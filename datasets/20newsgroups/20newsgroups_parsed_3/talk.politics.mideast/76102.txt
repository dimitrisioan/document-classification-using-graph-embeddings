that
is
what
is
so
hard
of
south
lebanon
israel
is
not
fight
an
armi
with
well
drawn
battl
line
but
a
guerilla
tyoe
resist
which
by
definit
and
necess
blend
with
the
local
populac
not
becaus
they
are
evil
coward
that
use
woman
and
child
a
shield
but
becaus
that
is
the
onli
way
one
can
fight
a
more
power
better
equip
occupi
armi
while
that
is
current
true
from
their
perspect
it
is
also
worthwhil
to
note
that
in
such
case
the
populac
often
doe
suffer
from
attempt
to
control
the
guerilla
furthermor
there
were
case
in

situat

the
argument
that
can
be
made

can
not
be
made

piec
hizbollah
and
amal
are
now
the
main
two
militia
though
hizbollah
peopl
tend
to
be
more
commit

oper
and
better
motiv
by

convict
a
i
recal
amal
wa
primarili
nationalist
lebanon
for
the
lebanes
motiv
i
think
that
the
differ
between
them
wa
also
a
matter
of
fund
and
support
one
question
doe
come
to
mind
howev
given
that
you
claim
the
hizbollah
to
be
more
commit
etc
and
that
their
state
posit
is
no
peac
talk
no

talk
n
no

talk
n
no
israel
if
we
assum
that
lebanon
and
syria
are
sincer
in
their
desir
for
peac
whi
hasnt
the
hizbollah
been
disarm
i
hope
you
are
right
on
isra
willing
to
withdraw
but
i
still
contend
that
withdraw
would
be
the
better
cours
for
israel
secur
sinc
it
would
reduc
it
militari
loss
and
i
claim
that
the
lebanes
and
syrian
govt
would
be
abl
to
prevent
ani
further
attack
on
northern
israel
bear
in
mind
the
abov
and
that
militari
loss
are
more
palat
than
civilian
one
i
am
sure
you
can
understand
whi
israel
is
slow
to
act
in
that
manner
no
the
syrian
govt
is
more
than
happi
to
have
israel
sink
into
anoth
lebanes
morass
i
could
elabor
if
necessari
hmm
here
we
disagre
on
what
serf
syria
interest
better
i
think
syria
want
to
have
lebanon
all
to
itself
it
would
be
will
to
guarante
northern
israel
secur
in
return
for
isra
withdraw
i
dont
think
syria
want
israel
to
be
involv
in
it
protector
of
lebanon
syria
is
sit
at
the
negoti
tabl
becaus
it
ha
come
to
accept
that
and
want
to
get
a
polit
resolut
a
renew
of
hostil
along
the
lebanes
front
could
put
the
whole
me
peac
negoti
back
in
question
i
agre
that
syria
want
lebanon
to
be
part
of
it
greater
syria
i
dont
necessarili
see
that
the
syrian
would
be
unhappi
to
see
israel
up
to
it
neck
in
anoth
lebanes
morass
afterwhich
syria
could
continu
on
it
merri
schedul
when
isra
public
opinion
would
lead
to
a
