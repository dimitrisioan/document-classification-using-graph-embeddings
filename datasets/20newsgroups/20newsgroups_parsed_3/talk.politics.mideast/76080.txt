i
said
the
fixat
on
bosnia
is
due
to
it
be
in
a
european
countri
rather
than
the
third
world
ken
say
intervent
in
somalia
is
a
counterexampl
i
am
a
staunch
republican
btw
the
ironi
of
argu
against
militari
intervent
with
argument
base
on
vietnam
ha
not
escap
me
i
wa
oppos
to
u
intervent
in
somalia
for
the
same
reason
although
clearli
it
wa
not
nearli
a
riski
base
on
the
same
reason
you
mean
you
were
oppos
to
u
intervent
in
somalia
becaus
sinc
somalia
is
a
european
countri
instead
of
the
third
world
the
desir
to
help
somalia
is
racist
i
dont
think
thi
same
reason
appli
to
somalia
at
all
no
you
have
complet
misunderstood
i
wa
oppos
to
intervent
in
somalia
for
the
same
reason
i
am
oppos
to
intervent
in
bosnia
there
is
no
secur
interest
of
the
unit
state
there
which
justifi
risk
the
live
of
american
serviceman
and
there
are
too
mani
crise
in
the
world
for
u
to
take
on
all
of
them
in
the
case
of
bosnia
the
risk
are
obvious
much
greater
and
there
are
other
countri
in
a
much
better
posit
and
with
far
better
reason
to
take
action
than
the
u
the
whole
point
is
that
somalia
is
a
third
world
countri
and
we
were
more
will
to
send
troop
there
than
to
bosniaexactli
the
opposit
of
what
the
fixat
on
european
countri
theori
would
predict
similarli
the
desir
to
help
muslim
be
fought
by
christian
is
also
exactli
the
opposit
of
what
that
theori
predict
you
continu
to
misunderstand
i
did
not
say
the
reason
whi
peopl
want
to
interven
is
becaus
of
racist
you
seem
to
be
overli
fond
of
use
thi
word
btw
i
said
the
phenomenon
wa
racerel
which
is
not
the
same
a
racist
perhap
thi
distinct
is
too
subtl
for
you
to
grasp
motiv
i
said
the
attent
and
outrag
at
the
entir
yugoslavian
situat
wa
a
result
of
it
be
closer
to
home
happen
to
peopl
we
can
identifi
with
and
relentlessli
harp
on
by
the
medium
i
never
said
anyth
about
which
side
would
be
prefer
which
ha
a
lot
more
to
do
with
the
present
of
the
conflict
than
ani
psycholog
factor
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
despit
the
fact
we
interven
in
somalia
the
level
of
attent
devot
to
there
wa
consider
le
than
what
is
devot
to
bosnia
if
the
newspap
and
tv
news
i
see
are
