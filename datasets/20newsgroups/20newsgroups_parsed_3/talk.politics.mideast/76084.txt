tim
clock
write
are
you
suggest
that
when
guerilla
use
the
popul
for
cover
israel
should
total
back
down
soth
easiest
way
to
get
away
with
attack
anoth
is
to
use
an
innoc
a
a
shield
and
hope
that
the
other
respect
innoc
live
tell
me
tim
what
are
these
guerilla
do
wrong
assum
that
they
are
use
civilian
for
cover
are
they
not
kill
soldier
in
their
countri
if
the
buffer
zone
is
to
prevent
attack
on
israel
is
it
not
work
whi
is
it
further
neccessari
for
isra
gun
to
pound
lebanes
villag
whi
not
just
kill
those
who
tri
to
infiltr
the
buffer
zone
you
see
there
is
more
to
the
shell
of
the
villag
it
is
call
retali
get
back
get
even
it
doesnt
make
sen
to
shell
the
villag
the
least
it
show
is
a
reckless
disregard
by
the
isra
govern
for
the
live
of
civilian
if
you
recal
a
subject
wa
rais
some
week
ago
that
touch
upon
thi
when
someon
claim
that
guerilla
were
manifest
of
popular
sentiment
the
topic
arosewhen
doe
a
civilian
stop
becom
a
civilian
if
he
hous
and
shelter
guerilla
of
hi
own
free
will
aid
them
ha
he
violat
hi
civilian
statu
what
so
the
whole
bit
about
attack
on
israel
from
neighbor
arab
state
can
start
all
over
again
while
i
also
hope
for
thi
to
happen
it
will
onli
occur
when
arab
state
show
that
they
are
prepar
to
take
on
the
respons
and
the
duti
to
stop
guerilla
attack
on
israel
from
their
soil
they
have
to
prove
it
or
provid
some
guarate
there
is
no
way
israel
is
go
to
accept
their
word
not
with
their
past
attitud
of
toler
toward
antiisrael
guerilla
inresid
if
israel
is
not
will
to
accept
the
word
of
other
then
imho
it
ha
no
busi
wast
other
time
come
to
the
peac
talk
but
dont
you
see
that
the
same
statement
can
be
made
both
way
if
lebanon
wa
interest
in
peac
then
it
should
accept
the
word
of
israel
that
the
attack
were
the
caus
for
war
and
disarm
the
hizbollah
will
remov

hezbollah
doe
not

if
israel
would
withdraw

villag
they
wouldnt
make
the
lebanes
so
mad
a
to
do
that
furthermor
with
hezbollah
subsequ
disarm
it
would
not
be
possibl
that
is
not
exactli
true
the
hizbollah
and
their
affili
group
have
made
sever
attempt
to
infiltr
the
border
of
israel
it
ha
not
without
the
support
and
activ
involv
of
syria
lebanon
would
not
have
been
abl
to
accomplish
all
that
ha
occur
onc
syria
leav
who
is
to
say
that
lebanon
will
be
abl
to
retain
control
if
syria
stay
thay
may
be
even
more
danger
for
israel
tim
when
is
the
last
time
that
you
recal
ani
troubl
on
the
syrian
border
not
late
eh
israel
know
veri
well
that
the
syrian
are
abl
to
restrain
all
who
would
use
territori
under
their
control
to
attack
israel
while
lebanon
would
be
better
off
with
syria
and
israel
out
of
it
border
the
presenc
of
syrian
troop
in
lebanon
ha
meant
a
sharp
decreas
in
attack
on
isra
territori
not
on
isra
troop
in
lebanon
howev
plea
note
the
distinct
in
the
past
two
year
true
but
the
syrian
did
allow
until
at
least
guerilla
to
oper
in
the
area
that
were
under
their
control
provid
that
those
guerilla
were
attack
isra
line
the
problem
is
that
syria
is
also
not
a
stabl
a
partner
for
long
term
