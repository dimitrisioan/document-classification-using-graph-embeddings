pleas

offend
at
thi
question
who
are
the
muslim
in
the
bosnian
context
i
know
that
a
moslemmuslim
is
a
believ
in
islam
islam
is
a
religion
and
it
is
practis
in
mani
part
of
the
world
but
it
is
not
ye
definit
not
an
ethin
group
ok
so
these
bosnian
muslim
who
are
they
to
which
ethnic
group
do
they
belong
what
languag
do
they
speak
do
they
have
a
differ
languag
from
that
of
the
serb
or
croat
the
way
the
western
press
use
the
word
muslim
in
thi
bosnian
debacl
ha
kept
me
wonder
when
the
mean
of
muslimmoslem
i
knew
from
childhood
wa
chang
in
the
dictionari
thi
is
just
a
question
no
flame
intend
oguocha
youv
ask
a
crucial
question
that
underli
much
of
the
genocid
bosnian
muslim
are
slavic
in
ethnic
they
speak
serbocroatian
but
there
is
a
christoslav
ideolog
wherebi
all
true
slav
are
christian
and
anyon
who
convert
to
islam
therebi
must
have
chang
ethnic
by
chang
religion
see
the
poem
of
ngego
or
the
novel
of
ivo
andric
who
brilliantli
display
these
attitud
on
the
part
of
what
he
call
the
peopl
ie
christian
slav
for
thi
reason
the
warcrimin
call
all
the
bosnian
muslim
turk
even
though
they
are
not
ethnic
turk
and
do
not
speak
turkish
a
their
first
languag
for
thi
reason
what
is
actual
a
genocid
label
against
those
who
are
ethnic
ident
but
religi
other
is
call
paradox
ethnic
cleans
rather
than
religi
cleans
you
are
somewhat
close
to
truth
but
you
shouldnt
forget
that
nation
is
a
recent
invent
of
the
western
europ
in
the
day
of
the
ottoman
empir
the
religion
wa
the
main
point
of
differ
between
social
class
the
ottoman
didnt
recogn
turk
arab
greek
serb
just
christian
muslim
jew
so
for
all
the
interest
parti
in
the
ottoman
societi
the
bosnian
muslim
were
turk
after
all
there
arent
mani
real
ethnic
turk
live
even
in
turkey
today
even
in
europ
it
the
cultur
that
defin
the
ethnic
and
religion
is
part
of
one
cultur
thu
while
a
war
rage
between
serb
and
croat
a
a
continu

and
