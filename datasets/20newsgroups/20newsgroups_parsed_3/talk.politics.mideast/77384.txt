unlik

repres
great

for

bosnia
presid
tudjman
clearli
state
in
hi
book
that
muslim
do
not
exist
a
a
separ
nation
from
croat
and
serb
and
he
mani
time
suggest
even
in
interview
to
foreign
paper
that
solut
is
to
split
bosnia
josip
know
thi
and
he
is
onli
work
on
the
imag
of
croatia
in
intern
relat
youll
learn
that
unless
weak
unit
to
counterbal
the
strong
player
soon
they
are
taken
over
and
that
the
end
of
them
balanc
of
power
think
ha
brought
togeth
croat
and
bosnian
muslim
thi
is
onli
natur
all
other
align
are
unstabl
im
work
on
point
out
thi
basic
fact
croat
and
muslim
have
been
awar
of
it
for
a
long
a
serbia
ha
exist
you
are
wrong
if
you
think
onli
imag
is
at
stake
here
croatia
ha
a
deep
interest
in
her
allianc
with
bosnian
muslim
and
vice
versa
i
think
tudjman
understand
thi
although
he
doe
not
have
much
choic
at
thi
point
tension
should
have
been
defus
better
earlier
befor
ani
open
confront
develop
although
i
still
think
croatia
will
surviv
it
will
lose
a
lot
but
bosnian
muslim
may
end
up
even
wors
off
howev
their
posit
now
is
so
horribl
that
perhap
they
do
not
see
it
get
ani
wors
the
key
point
is
do
they
still
have
ani
hope
left
if
not
then
all
bet
are
off
mr
stojanov
is
clearli
veri
veri
happi
about
thi
im
deepli
hurt
thi
is
not
about
some
imag
but
about
surviv
of
a
concept
of
a
partnership
which
i
believ
is
natur
and
essenti
for
both
croat
and
muslim
