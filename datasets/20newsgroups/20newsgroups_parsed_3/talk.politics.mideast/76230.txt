write
i
complain
about
the
u
take
the
point
in
bosnia
when
the
european
should
be
do
it
ken
say
the
bosnian
are
moral
superior
to
the
serbian
thi
impli
both
side
are
equal
true
it
may
sometim
be
difficult
or
imposs
to
determin
which
side
is
the
victim
but
that
doe
not
mean
that
victim
do
not
exist
ye
victim
exist
there
are
a
stagger
number
of
victim
in
the
world
and
more
each
day
i
think
on
balanc
intervent
would
creat
more
victim
includ
american
one
sinc
the
first
respons
of
the
u
govern
is
to
protect
american
i
think
they
serv
that
role
best
by
stay
away
from
bosnia
and
other
region
conflict
would
you
in
wwii
have
said
that
there
were
atroc
on
the
side
of
both
the
jew
and
the
german
of
cours
not
the
jew
were
not
tri
to
carv
a
territori
out
of
germani
either
and
except
for
smallscal
resist
and
a
few
larger
upris
did
not
have
an
armi
or
a
govern
these
peopl
have
been
butcher
each
other
for
centuri
when
one
side
win
and
get
what
it
want
it
will
stop
ye
but
both
side
want
differ
thing
the
muslim
chiefli
want
to
not
be
ethnic
clean
the
serbian
want
to
ethnic
clean
the
muslim
it
is
inde
true
that
each
side
will
stop
when
it
get
what
it
want
but
the
thing
that
the
two
side
want
are
not
equival
i
see
the
pattern
of
atroc
a
a
fairli
often
practic
tactic
of
a
colon
power
drive
away
andor
elimin
the
popul
of
an
area
they
want
to
control
the
u
tri
basic
that
in
vietnam
the
iraqi
in
kuwait
the
isra
in
palestin
south
africa
etc
etc
etc
it
suck
it
ugli
and
it
sadden
but
it
is
not
genocid
it
is
not
my
impress
that
the
serb
want
to
elimin
everi
muslim
in
yugoslavia
i
still
say
the
bosnian
are
get
their
as
kick
they
should
surrend
and
evacu
the
area
they
cant
hold
i
said
the
fixat
on
bosnia
is
due
to
it
be
in
a
european
countri
rather
than
the
third
world
i
recal
befor
we
did
anyth
for
somalia
appar
leftwing
say
that
the
reason
everyon
wa
more
will
to
send
troop
to
bosnia
than
to
somalia
wa
becaus
the
somali
are
thirdworld
who
american
consid
unworthi
of
help
they
suddenli
shut
up
when
the
u
decid
to
send
troop
to
the
opposit
place
than
that
predict
by
the
theori
i
am
a
staunch
republican
btw
the
ironi
of
argu
against
militari
intervent
with
argument
base
on
vietnam
ha
not
escap
me
i
wa
oppos
to
u
intervent
in
somalia
for
the
same
reason
although
clearli
it
wa
not
nearli
a
riski
for
that
matter
thi
theori
of
your
suggest
that
american
should
want
to
help
the
serb
after
all
theyr
christian
and
the
muslim
are
not
if
the
desir
to
interven
in
bosnia
is
base
on
racism
against
peopl
that
are
le
like
u
whi
doe
everyon
want
to
help
the
side
that
is
le
like
u
especi
if
both
of
the
side
are
equal
a
you
seem
to
think
well
one
thing
you
have
to
rememb
is
the
press
like
a
good
stori
good
for
busi
dont
you
know
and
btw
not
everyon
want
to
help
the
side
that
is
le
like
u
i
never
said
the
two
side
were
moral
equival
i
said
neither
one
is
innoc
there
are
just
too
mani
good
reason
to
stay
away
the
european
are
perfectli
abl
to
deal
with
thi
disput
on
their
border
in
ani
way
we
do
it
put
anoth
way
we
have
no
assist
to
offer
the
european
which
they
do
not
alreadi
posse
themselv
it
is
not
good
to
promot
the
idea
in
anyon
mind
that
the
unit
state
is
respons
for
clean
up
everi
bloodi
mess
in
the
world
clinton
is
not
the
man
to
lead
thi
countri
into
a
militari
adventur
full
stop
it
is
by
no
mean
clear
what
intervent
would
accomplish
nor
that
it
would
necessarili
help
the
victim
it
is
not
clear
what
the
goal
is
and
at
what
point
ani
commit
could
be
end
