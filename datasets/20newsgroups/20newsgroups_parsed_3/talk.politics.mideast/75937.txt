action
lead
to
war
no
one
in
hi
right
mind
would
sell
hi
freedom
and
digniti
palestinian
are
no
except
perhap
you
heard
about
antitrust
in
the
busi
world
were
there
antitrust
law
in
place
in
mandatori
palestin
sinc
the
answer
is
no
your
argument
while
interestingli
construct
is
irrelev
i
will
howev
respond
to
a
few
point
you
assert
in
the
cours
of
talk
about
antitrust
law
they
were
establish
a
bridgehead
for
the
european
jew
and
those
flee
arab
land
where
jew
were
second
class
citizen
plu
they
paid
fair
market
valu
etc
jew
often
paid
far
more
than
fair
market
valu
for
the
land
they
bought
they
did
not
know
they
were
victim
of
an
intern
conspiraci
you
know
sam
when
peopl
start
talk
about
an
intern
jewish
conspiraci
it
realli
begin
to
sound
like
antisemit
bull
the
reason
there
is
no
conspiraci
here
is
quit
simpl
zionist
made
no
bone
about
what
wa
go
on
there
were
confer
public
etc
all
talk
about
creat
a
nation
home
for
the
jew
israel
gave
citizenship
to
the
remain
arab
becaus
it
had
to
maintain
a
democrat
facad
to
keep
the
western
aid
flow
israel
got
no
western
aid
in
nor
in
or
it
still
grant
citizenship
to
those
arab
who
remain
and
how
is
grant
citizenship
a
facad
dont
get
me
wrong
i
beleiv
that
israel
is
democrat
within
the
constraint
of
one
domin
ethnic
group
jew
bad
arab
personali
ive
never
heard
anyth
about
the
arab
commun
in
isreal
except
that
theyr
there
so
ye
theyr
there
but
a
a
commun
with
histori
and
root
it
dead
becaus
youv
never
heard
of
it
it
dead
the
fact
is
you
claim
israel
had
to
give
arab
right
becaus
of
nonexist
intern
aid
then
you
see
that
that
argument
ha
a
hole
you
could
drive
a
truck
through
and
again
assert
that
israel
is
onli
democrat
within
the
unexplain
constraint
of
one
ethnic
group
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
arab
are
allow
to
vote
for
whoever
they
plea
so
plea
tell
me
sam
what
constraint
are
there
on
isra
democraci
that
dont
exist
in
other
democrat
state
ive
never
heard
anyth
about
the
khazakistani
arab
popul
doe
that
mean
that
they
have
no
histori
or
root
when
i
wa
at
ben
gurion
univers
in
israel
one
of
my
neighbor
wa
an
isra
arab
he
wasnt
realli
all
that
differ
from
my
other
neighbor
doe
that
make
him
dead
or
oppress
i
stand
correct
i
meant
that
the
jewish
cultur
wa
not
predomin
in
palestin
in
recent
histori
i
have
no
problem
with
jerusalem
have
a
jewish
charact
if
it
were
predominantli
jewish
so
there
what
to
make
of
the
rest
palestin
how
recent
is
recent
i
can
probabl
build
a
case
for
a
jewish
gaza
citi
it
would
be
pretti
silli
but
i
could
do
it
im
argu
not
that
jerusalem
is
jewish
but
that
land
ha
no
ethnic
adam
adam
shostack
if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drug
and
sexual
favor
we
sure
wouldnt
wast
