reader
i
am
wait
to
your
honest
answer
i
want
also
a
honest
answer
from
zionist
for
the
follow
question
whi
do
jew
who
dont
even
believ
in
god
a
is
the
case
with
mani
of
the
founder
of
secular
zionism
have
a
right
in
palestin
more
than
the
inhabit
of
palestin
just
becaus
god
gave
you
the
land
the
question
you
ask
is
complic
and
deserv
an
honest
answer
i
am
go
to
provid
one
from
my
own
current
perspect
not
a
histor
one
current
a
a

jewisraeliamerican
my
own
feel
is
that
jew
from
the
diaspora
do
not
have
a
greater
right
in
palestin
or
israel
than
the
palestinian
or
isra
both
arab
and
jew
do
with
regard
to
jewish
isra
they
should
have
the
same
right
in
israel
a
do
all
other
isra
whi
do
most
of
them
speak
of
the
west
bank
a
their
while
most
of
the
inhabit
are
not
jew
and
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
israel
who
are
them
if
by
them
you
mean
the
nonreligi
jew
i
think
you
should
be
awar
by
now
that
the
major
of
the
settler
and
their
support
are
religi
the
other
part
of
the
problem
is
to
my
knowledg
not
that
the
palestinian
dont
want
to
be
a
part
of
israel
a
much
a
they
would
accept
for
the
most
part
be
full
citizen
of
israel
with
all
the
privilig
and
respons
accord
isra
citizen
what
they
object
to
is
the
current
limbo
in
which
