arab
countri
to

isra
expansion
a
a
number
of
war
have
prove
your
answer
to
my
third
question
is
typic
of
a
stalinist
public
offici
i
dont
think
your
answer
is
honest
you
refer
me
to
vanunu
revel
about
israel
nuclear
arsen
without
evalu
the
truthful
of
hi
revel
now
if
he
said
the
truth
then
whi
should
he
been
punish
and
if
he
lie
whi
should
he
be
punish
i
would
appreci
more
honesti
somebodi
provid
an
answer
to
the
fourth
question
concern
hidden
prison
in
isra
prison
he
post
an
articl
from
maariv
document
such
case
it
seem
that
such
prison
do
exist
in
israel
what
do
you
think
about
that
you
impli
that
my
question
show
bia
and
are
formul
in
such
a
way
to
cast
aspers
upon
israel
such
term
have
often
been
use
by
the
soviet
union
against
dissid
they
call
the
soviet
union
into
disreput
if
my
question
are
not
disturb
they
would
not
call
forth
such
hyster
answer
my
question
are
clearli
provoc
but
they
are
meant
to
seek
fact
i
would
be
veri
happi
if
you
could
convinc
me
that
what
i
am
told
about
israel
were
just
fabric
but
ala
you
have
fail
to
do
so
i
suspect
that
you
fear
the
truth
and
an
open
and
honest
discuss
thi
is
a
sign
of
weak
not
of
strength
i
hope
you
will
muster
the
courag
to
seek
the
full
truth
