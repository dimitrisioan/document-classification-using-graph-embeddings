joseph
askew
write
there
are
arab
in
cabinet
but
look
how
long
it
took
and
to
what
insignific
posit
they
are
assign
and
thi
is
base
sole
on
race
not
polit
belief
or
secur
a
jewish
member
of
the
same
parti
have
alway
been
welcom
just
not
their
fellow
arab
first
of
all
the
arab
stand
in
ani
parti
or
a
ani
parti
is
sole
depend
upon
the
amount
of
polit
power
they
can
wield
effect
it
is
not
a
question
of
an
individu
stand
when
a
parti
put
up
an
arab
for
a
cabinet
post
and
that
arab
is
reject
but
the
posit
is
given
to
a
jew
from
the
same
parti
we
are
not
talk
about
power
but
racism
not
necessarili
a
shai
point
out
polit
appoint
are
base
on
power
they
are
also
base
on
favor
owe
coalit
build
and
deal
make
while
thi
may
have
a
racist
element
to
it
i
think
that
it
much
more
fair
to
attribut
it
to
the
old
boy
natur
of
polit
now
ill
freeli
admit
that
the
old
boy
system
ha
racist
and
sexist
effect
but
i
dont
think
that
those
are
it
purpos
whether
in
the
u
israel
or
elsewher
in
the
past
they
have
not
been
effect
at
garner
vote
and
form
a
singl
bloc
in
the
knesset
on
the
few
occas
when
thi
wa
done
some
of
the
parti
took
stand
that
were
extremist
and
ineffect
preclud
themselv
from
form
a
coalit
and
particip
in
the
cabinet
not
their
parti
them
a
individu
even
when
they
belong
to
nice
peac
zionist
mainstream
parti
they
are
not
welcom
arab
are
exclud
on
ficiti
secur
ground
which
are
just
an
excus
it
sure
look
like
racism
to
me
here
again
you
miss
out
on
the
old
boy
natur
of
polit
and
the
exist
of
backroom
deal
a
individu
these
arab
may
not
be
a
well
connect
a
the
jew
who
get
the
job
i
dont
like
thi
aspect
of
polit
but
i
understand
it
exist
adam

if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drug
