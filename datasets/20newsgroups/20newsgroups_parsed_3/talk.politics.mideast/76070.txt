re
nazi
eugen
theori
circul
by
in
my
post
i
have
made
a
propos
for
comment
and
discus
those
who
dont
want
to
discus
it
merit
and
drawback
are
not
forc
to
do
so
howev
i
would
make
anybodi
who
incit
other
to
harm
me
or
harass
in
a
person
manner
legal
respons
for
their
deed
i
can
not
accept
and
will
not
accept
threat
to
my
person
integr
and
i
urg
anybodi
who
oppos
terror
to
refrain
from
direct
or
indriect
threat
p
my
propos
ha
noth
to
do
with
nazi
eugen
it
ha
to
do
with
the
search
for
peac
which
would
enabl
justic
i
dont
consid
that
justic
is
done
when
nonjew
who
fled
or
were
expel
in
are
not
permit
to
return
to
their
homeland
thi
can
at
best
be
call
pragmat
a
nice
word
for
legitim
the
rule
of
the
strong
it
can
never
be
call
justic
and
peac
without
justic
will
never
be
peac
it
is
my
convict
that
the
situat
in
which
a
state
through
the
law
attempt
to
discourag
mix
marriag
a
israel
doe
is
not
normal
such
a
state
resembl
more
nazi
germani
and
south
africa
than
western
democraci
such
a
the
unit
state
in
which
jew
are
free
to
marri
whom
they
wish
and
do
so
in
the
thousand
my
propos
may
have
drawback
but
it
is
meant
to
forc
anybodi
to
anyth
just
to
compens
for
a
certain
time
mix
coupl
for
the
hardship
tehi
endur
in
a
societi
which
disapprov
of
intermarriagewhen
the
day
will
come
and
israel
will
becom
a
truli
civil
and
decmoract
societi
in
which
the
state
is
not
concern
with
the
religi
or
ethnic
affili
of
it
constitu
such
a
fund
would
not
be
need
ani
more
i
dont
mind
if
jew
wish
to
marri
jew
and
keep
their
tradit
whi
not
but
thi
is
not
the
affair
of
a
state
western
democraci
clearli
separ
these
domain
and
i
am
certain
that
most
american
jew
enjoy
thi
fact
and
would
not
love
to
live
in
a
state
term
christian
state
and
to
have
their
green
card
stamp
with
a
mark
jew
i
would
ask
those
who
are
genuin
interest
in
an
exchang
of
view
and
person
experiencc
to
refrain
from
emot
infantil
outburst
which
might
leed
reader
to
infer
that
jew
who
respect
judaism
are
uncivil
such
behaviour
is
not
good
for
judaism
