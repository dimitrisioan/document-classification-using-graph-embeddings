ok
i
donot
know
whi
there
are
isra
voic
against
negoti
howev
i
would
guess
that
is
becaus
they
refus
give
back
a
land
for
those
who
have
the
right
for
it
sound
like
wish
guess
a
for
the
arabian
and
palestinean
voic
that
are
against
the
current
negoti
and
the
socal
peac
process
they
are
not
against
peac
per
se
but
rather
for
their
wellfound
predict
that
israel
would
not
give
an
inch
of
the
west
bank
and
most
probabl
the
same
for
golan
height
back
to
the
arab
an
month
of
negoti
in
madrid
and
washington
prove
these
predict
now
mani
will
jump
on
me
say
whi
are
you
blame
isra
for
noresult
negoti
i
would
say
whi
would
the
arab
stall
the
negoti
what
do
they
have
to
loo
socal
what
do
you
mean
how
would
you
see
the
peac
process
so
you
say
palestinean
do
not
negoci
becaus
of
wellfound
predict
how
do
you
know
that
they
are
well
found
if
you
do
not
test
them
at
the
tabl
month
did
not
prove
anyth
but
it
alway
the
other
side
at
fault
right
whi
i
do
not
know
whi
but
if
let
say
the
palestinean
some
of
them
want
all
israel
and
these
are
known
not
to
be
accept
term
by
isra
or
mayb
they
palestinenan
are
not
yet
readi
for
statehood
or
mayb
there
is
too
much
polit
within
the
palestinean
leadership
too
mani
fraction
aso
i
am
not
say
that
one
of
these
reason
is
inde
the
real
one
but
ani
of
these
could
make
arab
stall
the
negoti
arab
feel
that
the
current
negoti
is
onli
for
legitim
the
current
statusquo
and
for
open
the
door
of
the
arab
market
for
isra
trade
and
orang
that
is
simpli
unaccept
and
would
be
revok
i
like
california
orang
and
the
feel
may
get
sharper
at
the
tabl
regard
