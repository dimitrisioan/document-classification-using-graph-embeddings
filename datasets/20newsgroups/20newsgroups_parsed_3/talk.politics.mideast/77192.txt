principl
while
i
support
the
establish
of

base
on
cultur
ident
so
here
are
some
question
i
have
to
ask
for
anyon
to
answer
my
point
is
what
someon
said
long
time
ago
in
polit
like
with

it
is
import
to
distiguish
between
what
they
say
they
do
and
what
they
are
actual
do
my
mother
is
jewish
and
so
is
my
father

i
appli
for

law
of

to
a
place
more
secur
among
