i
have
noth
against
greek
but
my
problem
is
with
fanat
i
have
met
so
mani
greek
who
wouldnt
even
talk
to
me
becaus
i
am
turkish
from
my
experi
all
my
friend
alway
were
open
to
greek
well
the
histori
war
current
situat
all
of
them
do
not
help

the
way
you
put
it
it
is
onli
the
turk
who
bear
the
respons
of
the
thing
happen
today
that
is
hard
to
believ
for
somebodi
tri
to
be
object
well
if
you
put
thing
into
histor
perspect
the
turk
move
into
an
area
which
wa
inhabit
by
greek
thi
is
how
the
histori
between
the
two
nation
start
some
centuri
ago
sinc
then
it
ha
been
a
continu
battl
between
the
two
nation
from
my
perspect
i
cant
see
whi
i
should
say
that
greek
have
been
respons
for
what
ha
happen
between
the
two
nation
of
cours
it
would
not
be
reason
to
argu
that
the
hostil
should
drag
till
we
kick
the
turk
out
of
thi
area
thi
isnt
go
to
happen
so
the
best
would
be
to
improv
the
relat
between
the
two
countri
a
golden
oportun
exist
with
cypru
if
thing
cant
work
there
there
isnt
ani
possibl
way
that
could
work
between
our
nation
when
it
come
to
conflict
like
our
countri
have
you
can
not
blame
one
side
onli
there
alway
are
bad
guy
on
both
side
what
were
you
do
on
anatolia
after
the
ww
anyway
do
you
think
it
wa
your
right
to
be
there
i
alway
avoid
to
discu
such
thing
i
consid
it
a
waist
of
my
time
besid
a
i
said
i
do
not
want
to
open
a
new
flame
i
am
not
say
that
conflict
start
with
that
it
is
onli
not
one
side
be
the
aggress
and
the
ither
alway
suffer
it
is
sad
that
we
both
still
are
not
tri
to
compromis
i
rememb
the
action
of
the
turkish
govern
by
remov
the
visa
requir
for
greek
to
come
to
turkey
i
thought
it
wa
a
posit
attempt
to
make
the
relat
better
i
thought
it
wa
a
smart
move
to
receiv
more
money
from
greek
tourist
i
bet
that
thi
week
there
should
be
about
tourist
from
greec
in
turkey
each
one
will
leav
at
least
so
go
and
figur
what
thi
mean
to
your
economi
if
you
had
kept
the
visa
requir
how
mani
greek
would
bother
to
visit
turkey
the
greek
i
mention
who
wouldnt
talk
to
me
are
educ
peopl
they
have
never
met
me
but
they
know
i
am
bad
person
becaus
i
am
from
turkey
polit
is
not
my
busi
and
it
is
not
the
busi
of
most
of
the
turk
when
it
come
to
individu
whi
the
hatr
come
on
do
not
extrapol
from
your
