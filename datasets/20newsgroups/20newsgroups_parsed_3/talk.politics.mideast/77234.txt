i
consid

a

that
claim
the
right
to
have
a

is
a
form

racism
although

ani
discrimin
base
on
religion
is
not
and
can
not
be
racist
unless
the
sole
qualif
for
religi
membership
is
racial
thi
is
not
the
case
for
israel
although
it
might
get
a
littl
closer
than
say
islam
thi
of

the
vex
question
of
church
antisemit
jew
have
been
heavili
discrimin
against
on
the
ground
of
religion
in
mani
christian
countri
if
we
take
russia
a
an
exampl
jew
were
serious
persecut
but
that
persecut
in
the
eye
of
the
church
and
state
stop
at
the
baptism
font
offici
anyway
if
a
jew
convert
there
were
no
legal
barrier
in
hi
way
that
i
know
of
anyway
peter
the
great
interior
minist
came
from
such
a
convert
background
can
we
then
claim
that
the
russian
orthodox
did
not
teach
antisemit
and
wa
not
antisemit
similarli
for
the
roman
cathol
church
i
suspect
so
a
thi
is
not
a
racial
taint
but
one
base
on
belief
and
a
is
after
all
a
form
of
racism
well
mayb
not
what
is
antisemit
then
if
not
someth
racial
base
i
wonder
if
