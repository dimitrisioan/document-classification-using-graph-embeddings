with
absolut
certainti
that
anybodi
who
reliesx
exclus
on
the
american
press
for
knowledg
about
israel
doe
not
have
a
true
pictur
of
what
is
go
on
of
cours
you
never
read
arab
medium
i
read
arab
isra
jer
post
and
thi
network
is
more
than
enough
the
jerusalem
post
is
onli
a
small
part
of
the
isra
medium
one
that
cater
to
outsid
for
the
most
part
anyway
if
you
never
read
haaretz
maariv
or
other
hebrew
langaug
paper
or
at
least
seen
some
of
their
articl
translat
you
are
not
realli
get
the
isra
medium
and
western
american
french
and
british
report
and
i
can
say
that
if
we
give
israel
and
arab
on
the
bia
scale
of
cours
you
can
switch
the
polar
isra
newspap
will
get
either
a
or
american
lead
newspap
and
tv
news
rang
from
inlcud
some
of
the
leftlean
one
to
ye
there
are
some
that
are
more
isra
than
isra
a
to
a
is
that
whi
station
such
a
pb
have
run
show
which
do
not
depict
the
isra
standpoint
at
all
is
that
whi
the
intifada
got
more
coverag
in
and
than
did
saddamn
gas
kurd
by
the
thousand
the
montreal
suburban
a
local
free
newspap
probabl
is
closer
to
kahan
view
than
some
isra
right
wing
newspap
british
i
am
from
montreal
i
read
the
suburban
did
they
ever
advoc
the
kahan
stupid
of
expel
the
arab
are
they
racist
the
suburban
ha
some
columnist
that
explain
the
isra
standpoint
they
are
noth
like
kahan
in
ani
case
the
suburban
is
a
paper
with
a
minor
local
distribut
and
no
influenc
rang
from
neutral
to
french
that
iknow
of
of
cours
rang
from
afrofrench
magazin
to
arab
offici
medium
rang
from
to
egyptian
to
in
sa
whi
no
becaus
they
do
not
want
to
overdo
it
and
stir
peopl
against
israel
and
therefor
against
them
sinc
they
are
do
noth
a
to
the
claim
that
isra
paper
are
bias
of
cours
they
are
some
may
lean
to
the
right
or
the
left
just
like
the
medium
here
in
america
but
they
still
report
event
about
which
peopl
here
know
noth
i
choos
to
form
my
opinion
about
israel
and
the
mideast
base
on
more
knowledg
than
doe
an
averag
american
who
reli
exclus
on
an
american
medium
which
doe
not
report
on
event
in
the
mideast
with
ani
consist
or
accuraci
the
averag
bia
of
what
you
read
would
be
probabl
around
while
that
of
the
averag
american
would
be
the
same
if
they
do
not
read
or
read
the
newyork
time
and
similar
newsmak
and
if
they
read
some
other
rel
le
bias
newspap
so
you
are
not
better
off
so
what
sourc
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
zero
ishay
