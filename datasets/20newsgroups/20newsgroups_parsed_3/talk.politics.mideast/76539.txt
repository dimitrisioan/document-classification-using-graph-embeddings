israel
never

the

ha
thi
ever
been

it

be
emphas
that
although
these

they
are
unit
in

selfpercept
a
palestinian
that
is
a
peopl
identifi
with
palestin
a
territori
entiti
not
an
ethnic
or
religi
entiti
incorrect
palestinian
themselv
claim
to
be
discrimin

on
an
ethnic

racial
basi
therefor
your
abov
statement
is
incorrect
i
also
note
that
given
the
previou
definit
of
racial
discrimin
the
onli
mean
that
you
could
argu
for
that
is
nationalist
howev
no
such
nation
ha
exist
it
definit
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
creation
of
israel
in
which
case
you
can
not
argu
racial
discrimin
dure
that
period
furthermor
palestinian
gener
consid
the
plo
both
a
a
symbol
of
nation
ident
and
a
the
unchalleng
author
that
repres
them
in

affair
onc
again
some
do
some
dont
the
nonjewish
popul
live
in
the
palestinian
and
other
arab
territori
occupi
by
israel
in
suffer
not
onli
blatant
discrimin
but
is
subject
to
brutal
militari
occup
anoth
gener
but
then
again
you
dont
seem
to
care
about
anyon
other
than
the
palestinian
peopl
whose
caus
you
espous
licenc
to
start
a
busi

to
buy

equip
the
right
to

all
of
these
basic
right
are
subject
to
arbitrari
rule
by
militari
author
and
can
not
be

incorrect
onc
again
they
have
the
abil
to
appeal
furthermor
although
you
may
not
agre
with
them
not
all
of
the
militari

are
senseless
or
arbitrari
some
are
but
thi
is
not
due
to
the
whim
of
the

a
much
a
the
sizeof
the
taskorgan
onli
jewish

incorrect
onc
again
i
know
two
arab
policeman
who
live
in
daheisha
and
there
were
more
of

with
the
outbreak
of

thi
number
substanti
in

defianc
of

and
the
will
of
the

the
state
of
israel
systemat
confisc
land
from
nonjewish
inhabit
of
these
territori
for
jewish
settlement
that
is
no
longer
true
and
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
your
purpos
iswa
in
post
thi
some
peopl
in
israel
properar
not
jew
most
of
them
consid
themselv
palestinian
with

citizenship
for
mani
year
after
the
establish
of
israel
they
were
subject
to
harsh
militari
control
much
of
their
land
wa
confisc
by
the
state
and
hand
to
jewish
organis
for
exclus
jewish

they
have
been
subject
to
massacr
destitut
and
humili
while
they
enjoy
with
jewish
isra
the
right
to

they
are
discrimin

both
through

and
in
practic
onc
again
to
hell
with
the
other
minor
that
dont
fit
in

their
are
mani
villag
who
did
not
suffer
in
the
way
you
seem
to
indic
abu
gosh
come
to

ye
some
did
but
a
a
result
of
what
action
approxim
of
the
surfac

within

is
for
all

palestinian
who
are
secondclass
citizen
in
israel
they
may
neither
legal
live

a
direct
