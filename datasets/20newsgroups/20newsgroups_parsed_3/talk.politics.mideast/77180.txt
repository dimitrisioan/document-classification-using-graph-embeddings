weve
dealt
with
with
your
argument
about
histori
befor
on
thi
net
suffic
it
to
say
you
havent
succeed
in
convinc
anyon
probabl
becaus
of
their
lack
of
basi
i
do
not
want
to
convinc
anyon
thi
is
just
usenet
not
the
real
world
i
just
read
the
opinion
other
have
about
a
subject
and
sometim
i
present
my
opinion
i
think
that
thi
net
is
onli
use
to
exchang
idea
i
never
want
nor
i
want
now
to
convinc
anyon
of
anyth
now
if
you
want
to
deal
with
what
certain
peopl
say
that
is
fine
but
by
condemn
the
movement
which
is
noth
more
than
jewish
nation
and
never
ha
been
anyth
more
than
that
you
are
say
quit
liter
that
it
is
racist
to
think
that
jew
your
own
peopl
it
should
be
ad
have
the
right
to
a
state
in
their
homeland
the
same
right
everi
other
nation
ha
if
you
dont
agre
with
that
i
suggest
you
read
a
dictionari
becaus
your
interpret
is
just
plain
inconsist
with
that
dictionari
definit
a
well
a
modern
histori
first
and
i
repeat
it
i
never
said
that
the
idea
of
jew
have
the
right
to
have
a
state
is
racist
zionism
a
a
movement
is
more
than
just
that
idea
i
think
that
zionism
in
the
way
it
defin
who
is
a
jew
for
exampl
is
racistlik
in
the
same
way
i
believ
that
irish
have
a
right
to
nation
but
i
do
not
support
the
bomb
and
kill
of
the
ira
i
believ
that
jew
have
a
right
to
nation
but
i
do
not
support
zionism
a
it
is
right
now
here
where
your
wrong
here
also
where
you
should
know
your
wrong
zionism
is
in
no
way
monolith
never
ha
been
approach
to
zionism
are
a
widespread
a
the
ideolog
of
hashom
hatzair
and
meir
kahan
some
of
those
approach
are
racist
kahan
for
one
but
everi
approach
to
zionism
defin
those
goal
differ
and
also
defin
a
differ
approach
to
those
goal
the
singl
common
is
the
belief
that
jew
like
everi
other
nation
on
earth
deserv
their
own
homeland
period
that
is
what
make
the
basi
for
zionist
movement
howev
i
am
not
consid
just
that
but
the
rest
of
it
a
long
a
zionism
consid
for
exampl
who
is
a
jew
in
a
jewish
state
base
on
religion
i
will
consid
zionism
a
form
of
racism
a
you
well
know
over
of
isra
jew
are
secular
in
other
word
they
are
in
no
way
religi
and
most
probabl
dont
even
believ
in
gd
which
make
an
interest
point
peopl
live
in
a
jewish
state
have
shown
that
jewish
cultur
includ
in
it
jewish
religion
but
they
are
not
the
same
so
the
jewish
peopl
live
in
the
jewish
state
have
shown
u
that
there
are
some
problem
in
a
state
where
of
the
peopl
is
secular
but
judaism
is
defin
accord
to
religi
standard
or
where
marriag
is
a
religi
stage
or
where
the
law
of
return
defin
a
jew
accord
to
a
religi
standard
did
those
isra
who
do
not
believ
in
god
and
will
never
do
becom
nonjew
whi
should
they
still
defin
then
a
jew
base
on
what
is
a
religi
definit
mayb
i
would
consid
hypocrisi
to
support
zionism
and
disregard
the
right
to
selfdetermin
of
the
palestinian
peopl
and
their
struggl
to
reach
it
if
youd
want
to
say
that
in
the
first
place
you
should
have
said
it
then
i
took
you
at
your
word
in
other
word
i
took
your
word
to
have
their
normal
dictionari
definit
it
is
now
quit
obviou
that
you
use
a
differ
dictionari
than
the
rest
of
the
englishspeak
world
and
that
you
base
your
analysi
