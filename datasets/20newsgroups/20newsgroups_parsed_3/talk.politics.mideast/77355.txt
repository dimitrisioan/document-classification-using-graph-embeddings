in

ilyess
b
bdira
write
it
look
like
ben
baz
mind
and
heart
are
also
blind
not
onli
hi
eye
i
use
to
respect
him
today
i
lost
the
minim
amount
of
respect
that
i
struggl
to
keep
for
him
to
all
muslim
netter
thi
is
the
same
guy
who
gave
a
fatwah
that
saudi
arabia
can
be
use
by
the
unit
stste
to
attack
iraq
they
were
attack
the
iraqi
to
drive
them
out
of
kuwait
a
countri
whose
citizen
have
close
blood
and
busi
tie
to
saudi
citizen
and
me
think
if
the
u
had
not
help
out
the
iraqi
would
have
swallow
saudi
arabia
too
or
at
least
the
eastern
oilfield
and
no
muslim
countri
wa
do
much
of
anyth
to
help
liber
kuwait
and
protect
saudi
arabia
inde
in
some
mass
of
citizen
were
demonstr
in
favor
of
that
butcher
saddam
who
kill
lotsa
muslim
just
becaus
he
wa
kill
rape
and
loot
rel
rich
muslim
and
also
thumb
hi
nose
at
the
west
so
how
would
have
you
defend
saudi
arabia
and
roll
back
the
iraqi
invas
were
you
in
charg
of
saudi
arabia
fatwah
is
a
legitim
a
thi
one
with
that
kind
of
clergi
it
might
be
an
islam
duti
to
separ
religion
and
polit
if
religion
mean
offici
clergi
i
think
that
it
is
a
veri
good
idea
to
not
have
govern
have
an
offici
religion
de
facto
or
de
jure
becaus
with
human
natur
like
it
is
the
ambiti
and
not
the
piou
will
alway
be
the
one
who
rise
to
power
there
are
just
too
mani
peopl
in
thi
world
or
ani
countri
for
the
citizen
to
realli
know
if
a
leader
is
realli
devout
or
if
he
is
just
a
slick
oper

the
countri

the
govern
wa
not

they
have
assert
that
the
approx
shiit
in

a
charg
that
under

guy
sheikh
bin

isnt
he
ilyess
call
for
sever
punish
of
the
or
so
woman
who
drove
in
public
a
while
back
to
protest
the
ban
on
woman
drive
the
guy
from
the
group
who
said
thi
abdelhamoud
altoweijri
said
that
these
woman
should
be
fire
from
their
job
jail
and
brand
a
prostitut
is
thi
what
you
want
to
see
happen
ilyess
ive
heard
mani
muslim
say
that
the
ban
on
woman
drive
ha
no
basi
in
the
quran
the
ahadith
etc
yet
these
folk
not
onli
like
the
ban
they
want
these
woman
fals
call
prostitut
if
i
were
you
id
choos
my
hero
wise
ilyess
not
just
reflex
ralli
behind
anyon
who
hate
anyon
you
hate
say
that
woman
should
not
be
allow
to
work
say
that
tv
and
radio
are
too
immor
in
the
kingdom
now
the
hous
of
saud
is
neither
my
least
nor
my
most
favorit
govern
on
earth
i
think
they
restrict
religi
and
polit
reedom
a
lot
among
other
thing
i
just
think
that
the
most
like
replac
for
them
are
go
to
be
a
lot
wors
for
the
citizen
of
the
countri
but
i
think
the
hous
of
saud
is
feel
the
heat
late
in
the
last
six
month
or
so
ive
read
there
have
been
step
up
harass
by
the
muttawain
religi
policenot
govern
of
western
woman
not
fulli
veil
someth
stupid
for
woman
to
do
imo
becaus
it
send
the
wrong
signal
about
your
moral
and
ive
read
that
theyv
crack
down
on
the
few
homebas
exparti
religi
gather
and
even
post
reward
in
governmentown
newspap
offer
money
for
anyon
who
turn
in
a
group
of
exparti
who
dare
worship
in
their
home
or
ani
other
secret
place
so
the
govern
ha
grown
even
more
intoler
to
tri
to
take
some
of
the
wind
out
of
the
sail
of
the
moreconserv
opposit
a
unislam
a
some
of
these
thing
are
theyr
just
a
small
tast
of
what
would
happen
if
these
guy
overthrow
the
hous
of
saud
like
theyr
tri
to
in
the
long
run
is
thi
