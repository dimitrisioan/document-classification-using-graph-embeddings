all
bad

and
we
ought
to
pick
a
coupl
biden
also
endors
lift
an
intern
arm
embargo
against

so
the
muslimdomin
bosnian
govern

a
chanc
to
at

defend
itself
against

thi
could
give

biden
said
despit
the
frustrat
and
pressur
christoph
had
no
enthusiasm
for
american
combat
aircraft
to
strike
serb
posit
in
bosnia
herzegovina
clearli
we
are
at
a
turn
point
in
the
bosnia
situat
christoph
said
air
strike
are
among
those
step
that
are
so
complex
becaus
they
tend
to
interfer
with
the
humanitarian
endeavour
i
think
there
may
be
better
option
humanitarian
a
in
feed
them
and
let
them
get
rape
and
kill
polit
conflict
clinton
vow
dure
the
presidenti
campaign
to
then
lift
the
arm
embargo
and
to
strike
at
serbian
heavi
weapon
with
u
combat
aircraft
christoph
said
airstrik
would
like
increas
the
level
of
now
fight
and
caus
our
alli
to
draw
back
or
even
pull
out
the
humanitarian
effort
great
britain
and
franc
have
balk
at
foreign
militari
intervent
in
bosniaherzegovina
for
fear
that
their
peacekeep
troop
on
the
ground
may
suffer
serbian
retribut
whi
dont
they
get
the
hell
out
of
there
they
are
do
noth
to
protect
the
victim
anyway
mayb
becasu
they
have
a
differ
agenda
sen
nanci
kassebaum
rkan
seem
to
agre
with
christoph
assess
and
stress
the
need
not
to
build
up
bosnian
expect
for
heavi
u
militari
intervent
it
veri
import
that
expect
arent
rais
high
on
the
part
of
the
beleagur
bosnian
she
said
air
strike
might
have
made
a
differ
eight
month
ago
she
said
but
the
strateg
signific
of
that
step
now
is
question
like
christoph
kassebaum
said
it
might
jeopard
the
humanitarian
relief
effort
now
that
they
made
sure
the
bosnian
who
were
the
onli
real
subject
of
the
embargo
last
year
a
everybodi
know
that
the
serb
had
an
unlimit
suppli
of
arm
wre
massacr
without
have
a
chanc
to
defend
themselv
now
thi
evil
coldheart
snake
is
say
it
is
too
late
to
save
them
so
let
them
die
