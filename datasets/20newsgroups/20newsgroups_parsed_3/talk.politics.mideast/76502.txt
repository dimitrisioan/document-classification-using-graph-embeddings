they
are
secret
about

most
peopl
often
suspect
who
they

what
they

most
of

thi
a
tri
and
true
method
util
by

group
to
conduct
oper
in

of
the
local

thu
forc

total
back
down
soth
easiest
way
to
get
away
with

tell
me
tim
what
are
these
guerilla
do
wrong
assum
that
they
are
use
civilian
for
cover
are
they
not
kill
soldier
in
their
countri
if
the
buffer
zone
is
to
prevent

whi
is
it
further
neccessari
for
isra
gun
to
pound
lebanes
villag
whi
not
just
kill
those
who

is
more
to

get

get
even
it

is
a
reckless
