clock
write
are
you
suggest
that
when
guerilla
use
the
popul
for
cover
israel
should
total
back
down
soth
easiest
way
to
get
away
with
attack
anoth
is
to
use
an
innoc
a
a
shield
and
hope
that
the
other
respect
innoc
life
tell
me
tim
what
are
these
guerilla
do
wrong
assum
that
they
are
use
civilian
for
cover
assum
also
come
on
brad
if
we
are
go
to
get
anywher
in
thi
or
ani
discuss
it
doesnt
help
to
bring
up
element
i
never
address
nor
comment
on
in
ani
way
i
made
no
comment
on
who
is
right
or
who
is
wrong
onli
that
civilian
are
be
use
a
cover
and
that
have
been
place
in
between
the
isra
and
the
guerilla
they
will
be
injur
a
both
parti
continu
their
fight
the
purpos
of
an
armi
use
of
militari
uniform
is
to
set
it
member
apart
from
the
civilian
so
that
civilian
will
not
be
thought
of
by
the
other
side
a
combat
so
what
do
you
think
is
the
mean
behind
the
intent
and
the
effect
when
an
armi
purpos
doe
not
were
uniform
but
go
out
of
it
way
to
look
like
civilian
they
are
judg
that
the
benefit
they
will
receiv
from
thi
cover
is
more
import
that
the
harm
that
will
come
to
civilian
thi
is
a
comment
on
the
isra
experi
and
is
say
that
the
guerilla
do
have
some
respons
in
put
civilian
in
the
middl
of
thi
fight
by
put
on
uniform
and
live
apart
from
civilian
barrack
etc
the
guerilla
would
significantli
lower
the
risk
to
civilian
but
if
the
guerilla
do
thi
arent
they
put
themselv
at
greater
risk
absolut
they
ask
themselv
whi
set
ourselv
apart
by
wear
uniform
when
there
is
a
readymad
cover
for
u
civilian
that
make
sens
from
their
point
of
view
but
when
thi
cover
is
use
the
guerilla
should
accept
some
of
the
respons
for
subsequ
harm
to
civilian
if
the
buffer
zone
is
to
prevent
attack
on
israel
is
it
not
work
whi
is
it
further
neccessari
for
isra
gun
to
pound
lebanes
villag
whi
not
just
kill
those
who
tri
to
infiltr
the
buffer
zone
you
see
there
is
more
to
the
shell
of
the
villag
it
is
call
retali
get
backget
even
it
doesnt
make
sens
to
shell
the
villag
the
least
it
show
is
a
reckless
disregard
by
the
isra
govern
for
the
life
of
civilian
i
agre
with
you
here
i
have
alway
thought
that
israel
bomb
sorte
and
bomb
polici
is
stupid
thoughtless
inhuman
and
ineffect
but
there
is
no
reason
that
israel
should
passiv
wait
until
attack
chose
to
act
there
is
everi
reason
to
believ
that
take
the
fight
to
the
enemi
will
do
more
to
stop
attack
a
i
said
previous
israel
spent
sever
decad
sit
passiv
on
it
side
of
a
border
and
onli
act
to
stop
these
attack
after
the
attack
had
enter
isra
territori
it
didnt
work
veri
well
the
host
arab
state
did
littlenoth
to
tri
and
stop
these
attack
from
it
side
of
the
border
with
israel
so
the
number
of
attack
were
consider
higher
a
wa
their
physic
and
psycholog
impact
on
the
civilian
caught
in
their
path
whatso
the
whole
bit
about
attack
on
israel
from
neighbor
arab
state
can
start
all
over
again
while
i
also
hope
for
thi
to
happen
it
will
onli
occur
when
arab
state
show
that
they
are
prepar
to
take
on
the
respons
and
the
duti
to
stop
guerilla
attack
on
israel
from
their
soil
they
have
to
prove
it
or
provid
some
guarate
there
is
no
way
israel
is
go
to
accept
their
word
not
with
their
past
attitud
of
toler
toward
antiisrael
guerilla
inresid
if
israel
is
not
will
to
accept
the
word
of
other
then
imho
it
ha
no
busi
wast
other
time
come
to
the
peac
talk
thi
is
just
anoth
select
appli
statement
the
reason
for
thi
drawnout
impass
between
ababspalestinian
and
isra
is
that
neither
side
is
will
to
accept
the
word
of
the
other
by
your
criterion
everyon
should
stay
away
from
the
negoti
that
is
precis
whi
the
palestinian
in
their
recent
pisga
propos
for
the
interim
period
after
negoti
and
lead
up
to
full
autonomi
are
demand
condit
that
essenti
defin
autonomi
alreadi
they
do
not
trust
that
israel
will
follow
through
the
entir
process
and
allow
palestinian
to
reach
full
autonomi
do
you
understand
and
accept
thi
viewpoint
by
the
palestinian
if
you
do
then
whi
should
israel
view
of
arabspalestinian
be
ani
differ
whi
should
they
trust
the
arabpalestinian
word
sinc
they
dont
they
are
veri
reluct
to
give
up
tangibl
asset
land
control
of
area
in
exchang
for
word
for
thi
reason
they
are
also
concern
about
the
sort
of
guarante
they
will
have
that
the
arab
will
follow
through
on
their
part
of
ani
agreement
reach
but
dont
you
see
that
the
same
statement
can
be
made
both
way
if
lebanon
wa
interest
in
peac
then
it
should
accept
the
word
of
israel
that
the
attack
were
the
caus
for
war
and
disarm
the
hizbollah
will
remov
the
caus
for
it
continu
occup
absolut
so
are
the
arabspalestinian
ask
first
for
the
isra
word
in
relat
to
ani
agreement
no
what
is
be
demand
first
is
land
when
the
issu
is
land
and
one
parti
final
get
hold
of
thi
land
what
the
other
parti
doe
is
total
irrelev
if
i
now
have
possess
of
thi
land
your
word
have
absolut
no
power
whether
israel
choos
to
keep
it
word
doe
not
get
the
land
back
afteral
israel
ha

hezbollah
doe
not

such
a
when

your
of
that

also
continu
of
cours
if
israel
would
withdraw
from
lebanon
and
stop
assassin
peopl
and
shell
villag
they
wouldnt
make
the
lebanes
so
mad
a
to
do
that
bat
guano
the
situat
you
call
for
exist
in
the
s
and
attack
were
commonplac
furthermor
with
hezbollah
subsequ
disarm
it
would
not
be
possibl
there
is
no
way
these
group
can
be
effect
disarm
unless
the
state
is
a
authoritarian
is
syria
the
onli
other
way
is
for
lebanon
to
take
it
upon
itself
to
constantli
patrol
the
entir
border
with
israel
essenti
mirror
israel
border
secir
on
it
side
it
ha
to
prove
to
isreal
that
it
is
thi
commit
to
protect
israel
from
attack
from
lebanes
territori
onc
syria
leaf
who
is
to
say
that
lebanon
will
be
abl
to
retain
control
if
syria
stay
thay
may
be
even
more
danger
for
israel
tim
when
is
the
last
time
that
you
recal
ani
troubl
on
the
syrian
border
not
late
eh
that
what
i
said
ok
but
doesnt
that
mean
that
syria
ha
to
take
over
lebanon
i
dont
think
israel
or
lebanon
would
like
that
what
both
side
need
is
to
receiv
someth
tangibl
the
arab
palestinian
are
look
for
land
and
demand
that
they
receiv
it
prior
to
give
anyth
to
israel
israel
ha
two
problem
if
it
give
up
real
land
it
is
expos
itself
to
a
chang
geostrateg
situat
and
that
chang
doesnt
help
israel
posit
and
when
it
give
up
thi
land
it
need
to
receiv
someth
in
return
to
compens
for
the
increas
