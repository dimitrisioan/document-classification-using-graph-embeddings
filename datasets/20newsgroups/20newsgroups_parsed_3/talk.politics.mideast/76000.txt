well
you
should
have
note
that
i
wa
cheer
an
attack
on
an
isra
patrol
insid
lebanes
territori
while
i
wa
condemn
the
retaliatori
shell
of
lebanes
villag
by
isra
and
israeliback
forc
my
team
you
see
wa
play
fair
while
the
oppos
team
wa
rearrang
the
face
of
the
spectat
in
my
team
view
stand
so
to
speak
i
think
that
you
should
tri
to
find
more
sourc
of
news
about
what
go
on
in
lebanon
and
tri
to
see
through
the
propaganda
there
are
no
a
priori
black
and
white
hat
but
one
sure
wonder
how
the
idf
can
bombard
villag
in
retali
to
pinpoint
attack
on
it
soldier
in
lebanon
and
then
call
the
lebanes
terrorist
if
the
attack
wa
justifi
or
not
is
at
least
debat
but
thi
is
not
the
issu
the
issu
is
that
you
were
cheer
death
dorin
dorin
of
all
the
critic
of
my
post
express
on
tpm
thi
one
i
accept
i
regret
that
aspect
of
my
post
it
is
my
hope
that
the
occup
will
end
and
the
accompani
loss
of
life
but
i
believ
that
stiff
resist
can
help
to
achiev
that
end
despit
what
some
have
said
on
tpm
i
think
that
there
is
a
point
when
loss
are
unaccept
the
strategi
drove
u
troop
out
of
lebanon
at
least

hi
brad
i
have
two
comment
regard
your
hope
that
the
occup
will
end
beliv
that
stiff
resistanceetc
how
about
an
untri
approach
ie
peac
and
cooper
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
would
happen
if
all
violenc
against
isra
stop
hope
violenc
against
arab
would
stop
at
the
same
time
if
a
state
of
nonviol
could
be
maintain
perhap
a
state
of
cooper
could
be
achiev
ie
greater
econom
opportun
for
both
peopl
live
in
the
territori
of
cours
given
the
current
leadership
of
israel
your
way
may
work
also
but
if
that
leadership
chang
eg
to
someon
with
ariel
sharon
mental
then
i
would
predict
a
consider
loss
of
life
ie
no
winner
secondli
regard
your
comment
about
the
u
troop
respond
to
stiff
resist
the
analog
is
not
quit
valid
the
u
troop
could
get
out
of
the
neighborhood
altogeth
the
isra
could
not
just
my
worth
no
offens
intend
respect
