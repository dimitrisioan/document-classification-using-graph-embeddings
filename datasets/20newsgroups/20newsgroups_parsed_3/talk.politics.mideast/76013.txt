also
by

may
still

let
return
for
a
moment
to
the
first
group
the
turkish
jew
who
came
from
europ
they
did
not
go
on
to
palestin
they
stay
in

it
wa
the
nonturkish
eastern
european
jew
who
pass
through
turkey
en
rout
to
palestin
their
stori
is
veri
interest
and
you
have
rescu
it
from
obscur
mani
studi
have
been
made
of
the
holocaust
but
most
of
them
do
not
focu
on
the
eastern
european
or
middl
eastern
jew
most
of
the
scholarship
ha
center
on
the
western
european
jew
of
whom
million
were
massacr
by

my
studi

much
smaller
number
of

jew
may
not
seem
so
signific
compar
with
the
total
of
