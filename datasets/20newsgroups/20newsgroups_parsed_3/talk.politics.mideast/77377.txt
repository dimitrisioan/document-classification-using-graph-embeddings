how
would
have
you
defend
saudi
arabia
and
roll
back
the
iraqi
invas
were
you
in
charg
of
saudi
arabia
all
muslim
knew
that
the
whole
thing
wa
set
up
to
destroy
iraq
not
to
liber
kuwait
the
peopl
who
were
kill
by
the
invas
are
more
mani
mani
more
than
the
one
that
were
kill
by
the
iraqi
in
their
smaller
invas
i
live
in
the
west
and
i
have
seen
how
your
medium
prepar
you
helpless
naiv
american
for
a
war
against
iraq
even
befor
the
artifici
conflict
between
iraq
and
kuwait
that
led
to
the
invas
a
the
cia
correctli
predict
and
pretend
to
be
surpris
not
to
know
it
just
happen
that
saddam
wa
so
predict
and
so
arrog
and
stupid
what
would
i
have
done
most
muslim
would
choos
dead
kuwaiti
over
dead
iraqi
and
dead
kuwaiti
the
first
case
would
happen
if
no
western
intervent
happen
and
the
second
case
wa
a
direct
or
indirect
result
of
western
envolv
human
right
in
kuwait
what
about
human
right
in
iraq
whi
the
west
gave
saddam
a
green
light
to
slaughter
hi
own
peopl
i
will
give
my
reason
becaus
the
rich
kuwaiti
do
not
mind
to
be
your
salv
so
they
deserv
some
democraci
but
iraqi
might
not
so
they
dont
a
simpl
a
that
whether
or
not
you
want
to
admit
it
i
think
that
it
is
a
veri
good
idea
to
not
have
govern
have
an
offici
religion
de
facto
or
de
jure
becaus
with
human
natur
like
it
is
the
ambiti
and
not
the
piou
will
alway
be
the
one
who
rise
to
power
there
are
just
too
mani
peopl
in
thi
world
or
ani
countri
for
the
citizen
to
realli
know
if
a
leader
is
realli
devout
or
if
he
is
just
a
slick
oper
not
necessarili
the
best
solut
my
view
of
an
islam
state
and
that
of
turabi
that
your
medium
made
you
hate
includ
all
the
benefit
of
a
secular

the
injustic
did
you
ever
read
a
book
by
rashid
alghannoushi
tunisia
hassan
turabi
sudan
you
onli
know
about
them
from
your
selfcensur
selfcontrol
medium
if
they
make
thi
kind
of
campaign
against
such
a
moder
thinker
a
turabi
is
and
keep
quit
about
such
an
extremist
muslim
scholar
a
bin
bez
of
saudi
arabia
is
it
just
doe
not
encourag
ani
moder
in

increas
awar
about

the
onli
thing
that

sinc
the
saudi
