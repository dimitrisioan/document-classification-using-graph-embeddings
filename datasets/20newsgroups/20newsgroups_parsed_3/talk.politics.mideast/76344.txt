the
sole
reason
they
were
not
jew
jew
who
also
left
for
exampl
to
europ
to
avoid
the
clash
were
allow
to
return
how
can
you
justifi
such
discrimin
if
thi
is
true
is
the
mere
fact
of
a
person
leav
area
of
combat
to
seek
refug
somewher
el
a
reason
for
strip
him
of
hi
right
to
live
in
hi
homeland
you
are
conveni
ommit
the
fact
that
the
arab
govern
told
the
arab
citizen
of
israel
to
leav
israel
join
with
the
arab
armi
so
that
after
what
they
felt
like
an
assur
victori
occur
these
arab
could
return
to
their
former
home
reclaim
them
a
well
a
anyth
el
they
want
that
belong
to
jew
when
the
arab
lost
israel
wa
left
with
a
bunch
of
peopl
who
ha
just
tri
to
kill
them
who
now
want
back
into
the
countri
a
citizen
what
would
you
have
done
let
them
in
so
they
could
kill
jew
israel
see
those
arab
who
stay
a
citizen
becaus
they
were
loyal
to
israel
dure
the
war
and
didnt
leav
of
cours
some
arab
could
have
left
to
avoid
the
fight
but
distinguish
between
the
two
is
imposs
therefor
a
decis
wa
made
base
on
secutur
of
the
countri
you
maintain
that
there
are
some
isra
arab
live
in
isra
kibbutz
i
wonder
how
mani
and
where
there
is
veri
littl
evid
avail
about
that
a
much
a
i
know
mani
arab
are
work
for
kibbutz
even
for
mani
year
but
are
not
accept
a
member
could
it
be
that
kibbutz
do
not
want
arab
no
kibbutz
that
i
have
ever
visit
ha
ani
employe
unless
they
had
to
hire
some
peopl
for
the
restaur
hotel
etc
if
there
werent
enough
peopl
on
the
kibbutz
to
do
them
in
such
case
they
are
paid
properli
if
a
kibbutz
turn
away
an
arab
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
of
thi
but
it
reflect
onli
on
the
membership
comitte
of
that
kibbutz
not
the
whole
kibbutz
movement
to
keep
it
what
way
i
am
certain
that
if
onli
religi
commun
in
the
u
would
be
ask
they
would
gladli
abolish
civil
marriag
so
that
peopl
would
depend
upon
rabbi
and
priest
to
offici
marriag
but
israel
ha
alway
been
rule
by
a
secular
major
your
answer
is
not
satisfactori
thi
just
show
how
ignor
you
are
of
isra
polit
although
the
major
parti
in
israel
arent
religi
howev
not
total
secular
due
to
the
format
of
the
govern
coalit
the
religi
parti
have
alway
had
a
lot
of
pull
sinc
they
were
need
to
form
a
major
coalit
in
fact
from
what
i
heard
the
present
govern
is
the
least
influenc
by
the
religi
parti
in
the
exist
of
israel
israel
can
not
be
call
a
secular
state
for
instac
haifa
is
the
onli
citi
in
the
countri
except
for
mayb
some
arab
citi
where
buse
run
on
the
jewish
sabbath
there
are
mani
other
exampl
of
religion
in
israel
marriag
in
israel
are
not
contol
by
the
state
but
by
rabbi
and
priest
obvious
your
disbelief
of
thi
fact
shed
some
light
of
your
ignor
of
the
countri
you
claim
to
know
so
much
about
steve
internet
fidonet
my
opinion
are
not
associ
with
anyth
