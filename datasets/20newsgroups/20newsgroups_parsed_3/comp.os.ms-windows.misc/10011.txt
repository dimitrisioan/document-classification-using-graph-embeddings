qmodem
drop
dtr
when
i
exit
the

and
therefor
hang
up
the
line
if
you
use
a
program
like
kermit
or
conex
to
establish
the

then
thi
need
not
be
done
these
program
do
not
necessarili
hangup
the
line
when
you
exit
note
if
you
use
univ
of

phone
to
dial

establish
a

you
do
not
need
to
turn
off
dtr
b
dial
and
establish
the
slip
connect
first
thi
can
be
done
automat
if
you
use
a
program
like
phone
from
the
univers
of
minnesota
which
will
dial
and
establish
a
slip
connect
then
load
the
slip
packet
driver
the
phone
script
languag
is
simpl
and
phone
script
can
be
easili
written
to
configur
phone
to
work
with
other
slip
server
in
addit
while
the
onli
packet
driver
that
phone
work
with
is
umslip
current
it
is
easi
to
write
a
batch

hack
that
let
phone
work
with
other
packet
driver
there
is
a
section
on

in
the

with
both
script

exampl
configur

base

of
these
four
i
vastli
prefer
cslipperex
over

for
the
follow
reason
a
it
is
much
faster
even
though
my

ha
just
a
uart
b
while
use
etherslipslipumslip
myself
and
sever
other
have
notic
that
the

clock
get
mess
up
after
perform
a

c
it
support
pktmux
when
use

d
when
use

cslipper
seem
to
work
with
everi
tcpip
applic
that
i
have
test
it
with
instruct
for
cslipperex
and
you
do
not
use
phone
a
load
slipper
in
your
autoexecbat

accord
to
instruct
for

if
you
have
a
vbi
modem
on
com
slipper
com
vec
baud
b
if
you
use
do
tcpip
applic
in
win
do
box
then
use
the
doubleend
packet
driver
shim
winpktcom
thi
creat
a
virtual
packet
driver
at
x
do
applic
in
nativ
mode
do
applic
in
window
do

and
window
applic
can
all
use
thi
virtual

at

winpktcom
x

c
if
you
use

next
qvtnet

if

instead

the
instruct
are
exactli
the

with
one
crucial
differ
you
will
have
