some
patienc
three
question
come
to
mid
real
quick
for
someth
like
thi
q
which
version
of
adob
p
will
we
clone
asid
from
the
level
and
level
issu
adob
ha
in
the
past
releas
new
code
that
incorpor
modificationsupgradesfix
just
a
all
other
softwar
vendor
do
the
level
stuff
may
seem
sound
now
but
i
assur
youchang
will
becom
more
frequent
a
their
custom
list
begin
to
dwindl
in
the
face
of
competit
thi
allow
them
to
shift
peopl
to
mainten
a
well
a
design
effort
for
level
q
do
we
duplic
the
bug
or
do
we
make
it
work
correctli
from
the
laserwrit
to
the
laserjet
there
have
been
bug
if
i
had
a
number
to
call
at
hp
or
adob
theyld
have
heard
from
me
decid
which
approach
to
take
depend
on
which
printer
you
want
to
emul
q
do
we
follow
the
red
book
or
do
we
follow
someon
implement
without
a
doubt
there
are
differ
between
the
red
book
and
adob
p
with
level
mani
issu
have
been
refin
but
the
red
book
doe
leav
big
big
hole
in
the
implement
specif
stuff
it
would
be
nice
it
the
red
bood
at
least
pine
thing
down
enough
so
that
two
differ
implement
of
adob
p
dont
do
the
exact
opposit
given
an
ident
set
of
condit
q
pscriptdrv
have
done
a
lot
of
p
clone
test
myself
the
unfortun
side
of
test
is
the
limit
number
of
sourc
for
test
file
the
primari
sourc
we
use
is
genoa
and
have
character
their
p
at
file
of
them
over
half
are
taken
from
pscriptdrv
it
may
not
ideal
but
the
at
file
are
what
the
printer
vendor
use
im
sure
that
adob
us
them
too
but
adob
output
is
by
definit
correct
even
if
it
wrong
ye
there
are
some
veri
poor
clone
weve
seen
them
here
at
rastek
a
sub
of
genicom
which
ha
it
own
clone
call
geniscript
some
are
poor
for
lack
of
design
some
are
poor
becaus
they
follow
the
red
book
and
some
are
poor
becaus
the
vendor
dont
know
what
p
is
