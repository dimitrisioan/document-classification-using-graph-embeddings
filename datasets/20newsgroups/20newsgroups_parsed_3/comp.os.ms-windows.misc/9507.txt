hello
im
investig
the
purchas
of
an
object
orient
applic
framework
i
have
come
across
a
few
that
look
good
zinc
ha
a
platform
independ
resourc
strategi
not
too
import
for
me
right
now
just
a
thought
on
resourc
it
is
veri
import
if
you
do
use
a
multiplatform
toolkit
to
check
on
how
it
use
resourc
i
have
use
glockenspeil
commonview
under
motif
and
o
i
wrote
a
resourc
convert
from
o
to
motif
but
it
realli
wasnt
too
easi
especi
the
name
scheme
in
motif
you
can
not
renam
controlswidget
with
window
you
can
call
the
ok
button
idok
in
everi
instanc
thi
doesnt
work
for
motif
youd
have
to
call
it
dialogok
and
motif
expect
a
text
string
rather
than
a
number
so
your
constructor
should
know
how
to
convert
a
defin
into
the
proper
resourc
identifi
id
check
on
how
the
toolkit
expect
name
and
that
if
it
doe
use
resourc
that
is
use
resourc
for
all
platform
you
intend
to
port
to
by
the
way
i
would
never
use
commonview
or
glockenspiel
for
anyth
