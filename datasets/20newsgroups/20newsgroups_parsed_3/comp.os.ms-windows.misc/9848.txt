solut
doe
microsoft
think
they
are
what
everyon
should
be
just
vent
steam
i
had
the
same
problem
at
first
i
thought
it
wa
the
video
driver
and
made
sure
i
had
the
most
current
driver
becaus
the
problem
wa
most
evid
at
svga
resolut
mode
it
didnt
help
and
after
a
bit
of
experiment
determin
that
the
problem
exist
in
standard
vga
resolut
mode
it
wa
just
much
le
notic
my
mous
wa
an
older
m
serial
version
i
bought
second
hand
in
it
work
just
fine
in
do
and
do
base
graphic
applic
on
the
guess
that
the
problem
wa
with
the
resolut
of
the
mous
i
borrow
a
new
mous
a
m
bu
model
and
tri
it
that
solv
the
problem
so
if
your
mous

old
you
may
want
to
tri
replac
it
for
a
newer
one
