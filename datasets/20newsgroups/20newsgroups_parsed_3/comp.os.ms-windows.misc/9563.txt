veri
good
review
in

write
the
pc
world
review
found
out
that
the
herc
peopl
had
hardcod
winbench
text
into
the
driver
clever
no
in
ani
case
the
winbench
result
are
pretti
much
inflat
two
thing
that
annoy
me
about
the
pc
magazin
review
their
benchmark
techniqu
is
serious
flaw
a
wa
clearli
shown
by
the
graphit
and
gxe
cheat
cant
they
just
admit
that
their
benchmark
is
to
easi
to
optim
for
andor
cheat
on
wintach
is
much
harder
to
beat
the
big
cheat
that
herculesiit
use
wa
overlappip
bitblit
and
polylin
optim
and
hercul
sent
them
a
new
driver
which
didnt
do
thi
but
produc
almost
ident
score
yet
the
onli
thing
pc
magazin
say
is
that
score
are
not
legitim
couldnt
they
at
least
make
some
comment
about
it
realworld
perform
im
not
so
much
go
by
winbench
for
perform
but
rather
by
steve
gibson
result
which
are
more
realworld
base
like
use
micrografx
draw
to
benchmark
if
you
believ
gibson
that
is
he
write
despit
these
document
cheat
i
have
to
say
that
in
realworld
applic
the
hercul
graphit
adapt
actual
draw
faster
than
ani
other
display

in
the
industri
even
though
it
