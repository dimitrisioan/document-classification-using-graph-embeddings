tjr
cutt
write
even
so
my
point
still
stand
to
an
extent
that
k
limit
appear
all
over
the
place
where
they
realli
are
not
necessari
such
a
the
edit
control
limit
while
the
k
limit
may
not
be
necessari
limit
they
probabl
fall
within
the
categori
of
reason
limit
if
you
find
yourself
tri
to
alloc
an
edit
control
for
more
than
k
of
text
it
probabl
time
take
a
good
look
at
your
program
design
whi
is
there
such
a
small
limit
to
the
number
of
global
memori
handl
allow
in
what
way
is
a
small
number
it
seem
to
me
that
youd
hit
the
wall
in
mani
other
way
befor
youd
hit
the
systemwid
limit
on
global

and
plea
dont
tri
to
tell
me
that
it
imposs
to
abus
the
resourc
avail
under
other
oper
system
all
system
have
limit
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
limit
are
reason
so
far
you
havent
offer
a
singl
argument
which
suggest
that
window
