i
am
consid
buy
borland
paradox
for
window
sinc
i
would
like
to
use
a
databas
with
window
i
dont
haveus
one
yet
for
both
workhom
use
i
would
like
to
advantag
of
borland
until
april
offer
if
thi
packag
is
everyth
that
borland
claim
it
to
be
so
i
wa
wonder
ha
anybodi
use
thi
andor
have
ani
opinion
tom
belmont
if
you
are
interest
in
a
program
which
is
veri
easi
to
use
i
strongli
suggest
approach
it
is
extrem
easi
to
use
make
report
etc
i
own
both
it
and
paradox
and
i
almost
never
use
paradox
if
you
need
to
build
up
a
complic
applic
then
paradox
is
the
way
to
go
i
have
heard
horror
stori
about
the
access
program
be
extrem
cryptic
sinc
you
seem
like
you
will
probabl
be
do
fairli
small
stuff
work
home
use
and
you
have
not
use
a
databas
befor
i
recommend
approach
i
have
found
onli
one
small
thing
which
i
would
like
it
to
do
more
easili
i
have
one
databas
where
the
order
in
which
the
record
are
enter
must
be
differ
than
what
is
the
logic
order
to
perman
reorder
to
use
the
old
dbase
iii
command
the
record
requir
sort
the
record
appropri
no
problem
sinc
i
almost
alway
use
them
in
thi
order
export
the
databas
to
anoth
databas
which
can
still
be
an
approach
databas
and
then
copi
the
export
file
back
to
the
origin
filenam
thi
is
a
small
weak
consid
the
other
item
i
realli
like
about
approach
it
is
also
a
littl
slower
than
paradox
other
than
the
load
paradox
take
forev
and
a
minut
to
load
paradox
also
take
a
lot
of
memori

hard
