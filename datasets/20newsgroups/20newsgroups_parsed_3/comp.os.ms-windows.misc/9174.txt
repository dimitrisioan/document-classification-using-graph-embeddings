here
window
i
can

believ
that
it

at

you
would
need
a
special
version
of
a
mous
driver
that
look
at
com
and
com
instead
of
com
and
com
i
know
that
irq
and
irq
are
normal
printer
port
irq
but
i
ive
seen
noth
like
that
ive
experi
with
logitech
mous
driver
too
with
no
sucess
have
no
printer
attach
a
side
note
is
that
i
would
realli
like
to
assign
com
to
some
higher
irq
becaus
my
soundblast
board
use
irq
right
now
im
not
use
com
but
no
modem
that
i
know
of
allow
set
other
than
irq
and
if
you
have
a
soundblast
pro
it
should
support
irq
a
well
final
a
board
that
support
irq
