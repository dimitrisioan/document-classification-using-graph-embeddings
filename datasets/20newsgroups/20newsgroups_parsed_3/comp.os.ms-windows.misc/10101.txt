re
question
on
eisa
video
board
perform
from
articl
by
christoph
f
wroten
i
have
an
eisa
machin
and
i
just
do
not
understand
whi
most
eisa
video
card
onli
match
the
perform
of
their
isa
counterpart
for
instanc
the
eisa
orchid
pro
design
iis
is
onli
about
a
fast
a
the
isa
diamond
speedstar
plu
which
isnt
what
i
would
call
fast
i
dont
understand
whi
eisa
video
card
arent
a
a
group
on
the
same
level
of
perform
a
local
bu
card
given
that
eisa
video
card
have
a
bit
bu
to
move
data
around
instead
of
isa
bit
good
question
answer
the
eisa
bu
doe
move
bit
rather
than
isa
but
it
still
move
it
at
about
the
speed
a
the
isa
bu
i
think
that
either
or
mhz
the
local
bu
design
also
move
bit
like
the
eisa
but
they
move
the
data
at
the
cpu
speed
up
to
mhz
so
on
a
mhz
cpu
the
local
bu
is
move
bit
data
at
mhz
and
the
eisa
is
move
bit
data
at
or
mhz
so
the
local
bu
should
be
to
time
faster
than
eisa
on
a
mhz
cpu
eisa
should
be
about
two
mayb
time
a
fast
a
isa
sinc
they
are
not
whi
would
anyon
me
includ
pay
a
higher
cost
for
a
eisa
video
card
when
it
perform
is
no
better
than
and
often
wors
that
a
much
cheaper
isa
video
board
such
a
a
diamond
speedstar
x
from
pc
magazin
i
think
recent
report
i
know
that
ati
make
a
pretti
fast
eisa
video
card
but
it
around
which
is
just
about
doubl
what
my
wallet
will
allow
me
to
spend
and
for
i
could
get
a
diamond
viper
and
still
have
left
over
of
cours
id
have
to
get
a
local
bu
mother
board
too
that
a
veri
good
question
the
eisa
bu
doe
have
more
advantag
over
the
isa
bu
than
just
it
width
for
exampl
morebett
interrupt
and
bu
master
but
these
other
factor
do
not
impact
a
video
card
veri
much
they
have
more
impact
on
file
server
with
multipl
hard
drive
fullthrottl
network
card
cdrom
etc
can
anyon
shed
some
light
on
my
confusionfrustr
