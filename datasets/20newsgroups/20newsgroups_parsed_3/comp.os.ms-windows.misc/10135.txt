hi
i
am
think
of
upgrad
to
the
beta
version
of
window
nt
on
a
sx
mhz
mb
hard
disc
can
someon
plea
give
me
there
opion
on
such
a
setup
for
run
nt
and
is
the
oper
system
like
to
be
better
than
window
or
unix
steve
ive
been
use
window
nt
tm
sinc
the
octob
releas
and
i
have
to
say
that
the
march
releas
is
realli
a
big
improv
window
nt
tm
is
becom
usabl
there
are
a
few
thing
to
consid
befor
you
make
the
leap
though
first
for
me
at
least
is
that
you
can
not
get
a
fullspe
do
box
what
i
mean
is
i
can
not
for
instanc
run
falcon
or
ani
other
resours
intens
program
in
a
do
box
it
absolutley
crawl
and
my
machin
is
a
with
a
mb
hd
and
mb
ram
if
anyon
know
how
to
get
a
fast
do
box
or
fullscreen
for
that
matter
plea
let
me
know
the
second
thing
is
there
are
still
not
mani
driver
around
for
stuff
for
instanc
my
pa
ha
been
demot
to
run
a
a
sound
blaster
which
is
nativ
support
nice
becaus
mediavis
hasnt
produc
driver
yet
your
disk
should
be
larg
enough
to
keep
an
mb
do
partit
and
give
the
rest
over
to
window
nt
tm
the
onli
thing
is
whenev
you
want
to
run
window
program
youd
have
to
reboot
and
log
into
window
nt
tm
instead
of
just
type
win
window
nt
tm
doe
seem
to
be
much
more
stabl
than
normal
window
though
itd
be
a
good
choic
if
you
have
the
resourc
you
should
realli
have
at
least
mb
ram
though
one
last
thing
modem
work
well
enough
but
i
have
yet
to
get
my
fax
card
to
work
and
ive
never
heard
of
anyon
el
who
did
either
it
onli
better
than
unix
becaus
it
run
killer
softwar
out
of
the
box
wherea
with
unix
there
isnt
the
same
availabl
i
guess
it
come
down
to
window
nt
tm
is
not
yet
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
still
a
beta
but
it
a
veri
good
beta
