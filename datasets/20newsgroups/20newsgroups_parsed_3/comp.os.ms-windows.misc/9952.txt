netx
will
run
but
i
cant
access
drive
f
to
log
in

novel
if
i
dont
put
lastdriv
z
in
my
configsi
i
cant
access
other
wwg
drive
from
the
filemanag
it
seem
that
there
should
be
a
way
to
make
netx
work
with
the
lastdriv
statement
in
my
configsi
first
off
i
havent
use
wwg
but
i
think
that
about
to
chang
the
problem
is
the
lastdriv
command
and
the
way
netwar
in
gener
and
in
thi
case
netx
in
particular
add
drive
to
the
devic
chain
set
lastdrivez
mean
there
are
no
unassign
a
oppos
to
unus
drive
letter
for
netwar
to
use
a
it
tack
it
drive
map
onto
the
end
of
the
exist
list
of
drive
wwg
obvious
attach
it
network
drive
to
exist
unus
drive
letter
id
guess
the
next
thing
id
tri
is
someth
like
lastdrivem
which
on
most
machin
will
leav
a
fair
swath
of
drive
for
wwg
and
still
allow
up
to
netwar
drive
map
a
well
wwg
requir
do

i
use
lastdrivej
which
make
my
first
