from
we
jame
we
here
at
utah
state
univers
cooper
extens
have
been
use
wwg
for
a
while
now
we
want
to
talk
to
the
internet
with
the
mail
packag
so
we
got
the
smtp
gateway
you
also
need
a
tcpip
transport
packag
on
top
of
that
which
is
utterli
stupid
but
that
what
they
requir
to
get
the
smtp
gateway
to
work
you
need
a
dedic
pc
for
the
gateway
and
if
you
are
look
at
remot
access
you
need
anoth
dedic
pc
for
the
remot
mail
stuff
we
do
not
have
the
remot
mail
go
but
you
indic
that
that
is
what
you
want
to
do
there
is
a
glitch
somewher
in
the
system
though
i
dont
know
if
it
is
m
mail
the
gateway
or
the
vax
here
on
campu
that
is
choke
in
the
mail
that
is
sent
the
scenario
is
thi
the
outgo
mail
go
to
a
unix
system
which
then
rout
the
mail
where
it
need
to
go
if
that
mail
is
rout
to
the
vax
the
vax
ha
problem
some
time
receiv
the
mail
most
messag
do
get
through
thi
way
except
if
someon
ha
there
mail
on
the
vax
forward
to
some
other
locat
that
is
the
main
gotcha
where
ever
the
mail
is
forward
to
that
person
get
a
messag
header
then
a
messag
say
boudari
error
garbag
code
stuff
if
you
can
stay
away
from
send
to
a
vax
you
are
ok
the
system
peopl
of
cours
say
that
the
vax
is
not
the
problem
the
gateway
is
probabl
the
problem
if
anyon
want
to
get
help
it
is
onli
for
one
support
call
until
problem
is
work
out
phooey
to
that
i
say
i
am
look
vigor
for
a
better
idea
if
you
go
forward
on
ani
of
thi
and
find
out
anyth
knew
pleas
drop
me
a
note
anyon
the
next
itter
is
suppos
to
have
tcpip
built
in
they
say
the
netxt
itter
of
wwg
