write
i
think
most
of
the
peopl
post
are
forget
that
most
user
of
m
product
do
not
even
know
about
internet
and
unix
is
that
veri
unfriendli
place
where
bizzar
abrevi
replac
the
rather
comfort
abrevi
they
know
and
the
abrevi
have
subtl
differ
between
the
differ
vendor
while
pc
user
tend
to
custom
ani
window
setup
they
can
not
do
much
with
their
command
line
you
cant
custom
a
command
line
interfac
where
have
you
been
i
can
chang
the
prompt
i
can
make
alias
so
someon
like
me
who
is
use
to
say
l
can
type
it
on
my
do
machin
and
still
get
a
directori
list
and
under
unix
if
i
dont
like
the
command
line
interfac
i
throw
it
out
and
get
a
differ
one
csh
bash
ksh
sh
etc
so
to
most
of
the
comput
user
in
the
world
m
product
symbol
qualiti
m
ha
made
their
life
easier
and
more
product
and
to
them
that
is
qualiti
they
do
not
care
about
what
innov
thing
m
ha
done
other
than
to
make
their
life
with
a
comput
one
heck
of
a
lot
easier
you
may
know
better
than
most
comput
user
in
thi
world
but
that
will
not
chang
their
percept
thi
is
true
face
it
until
unix
come
up
with
a
decent
gui
that
is
avail
to
all
variat
of
unix
it
just
will
not
catch
on
with
the
mainstream
of
comput
user
we
here
on
the
net
are
not
mainstream
comput
user
a
decent
gui
for
all
variat
of
unix
lesse
what
about
motif
or
the
stuff
from
mit
twm
come
to
mind
those
are
pretti
standard
heck
an
xwindow
program
run
like
it
like
to
all
the
end
user
ha
to
realli
know
is
how
to
manipul
the
actual
window
with
the
mous
and
sinc
it
is
a
gui
it
graphic
and
a
bit
easier
to
figur
out
someth
the
window
peopl
have
been
press
down
our
throat
for
some
time
now
the
thing
i
fear
is
that
there
will
be
a
gap
between
the
normal
user
run
window
all
flavor
and
the
other
power
user
run
unix
and
other
more
advanc
ose
at
least
right
now
do
is
still
pretti
much
king
i
can
bring
a
copi
of
my
latest
whizbang
program
demo
over
to
my
friend
hous
and
sinc
we
both
run
do
he
can
enjoy
it
too
or
prefer
