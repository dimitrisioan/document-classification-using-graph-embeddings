i

window
is
there
an
easi
way
to
restor

what
might
be
some
better
approach
youll
probabl
want

fresh

thing
and
window
also
run
a
swap
file
which
may
contain
data
also
all
of
thi
is
pretti
riski
stuff
in
a
pc
environ
the
straightforward
approach
would
be
to
run
chkdsk
with
the
f
option
to
fix
the
disk
and
then
it
look
like
i
would
probabl
have
to
reinstal
window
and
a
few
other
thing
a
reason
accur
predict
here
a
brief
descript
of
how
do
store
file
there
are
three
piec
to
a
file
the
directori
entri
the
fat
chain
and
the
data
area
you
can
think
of
these
a
a
sheet
of
line
notebook
paper
a
sheet
of
graph
paper
and
a
stack
of
x
card
the
directori
entri
notebook
paper
hold
the
file
name
actual
size
and
first
cluster
number
it
also
hold
some
other
inform
that
not
import
right
now
the
file
alloc
tabl
fat
chain
graph
paper
tell
where
to
find
the
actual
data
each
squar
of
graph
paper
hold
a
number
if
the
number
is
zero
the
cluster
associ
with
thi
box
is
avail
if
it
hold
a
magic
number
it
is
either
the
last
piec
of
a
file
or
a
bad
unus
spot
on
the
disk
ani
other
number
tell
which
cluster
contain
the
next
section
of
the
file
the
data
area
x
card
is
where
the
actual
inform
is
store
the
data
area
is
organ
a
cluster
of
a
fix
size
storag
is
dole
out
in
chunk
of
one
cluster
each
in
your
case
one
cluster
is
byte
a
a
cluster
is
fill
anoth
is
alloc
to
read
a
file
you
first
look
at
the
directori
entri
to
get
the
start
cluster
number
now
you
read
the
data
from
that
cluster
next
look
at
the
fat
entri
for
the
cluster
you
just
read
thi
will
tell
you
the
cluster
number
for
the
next
chunk
of
the
file
natur
these
number
are
usual
sequenti
but
they
can
jump
around
and
even
go
backward
continu
read
one
cluster
at
a
time
a
you
walk
thi
chain
through
the
fat
until
you
hit
the
marker
which
say
it
the
last
cluster
in
the
file
chkdsk
is
the
do
util
that
check
the
saniti
and
coher
of
the
directori
and
the
fat
and
can
bludgeon
most
flaw
into
submiss
it
doesnt
have
ani
intellig
so
you
have
to
doublecheck
anyth
it
fix
now
let
do
a
bit
of
a
postmortem
