not

one
of
the
unadvertis
limit
of
most
current

pc
is
that
their
rsc
serial

perform
is
serious
defici
almost
everyon

purchas

v

the
problem
the
first

they
tri

an

at

upgrad
the

overrun
and
retri
error
abound
even
when
the
onli
activ
applic
is
the

or

program
if
the
transfer
complet
at
all
it
may
take
even
longer
than
with
the
old
bp
modem
there
are
three
reason
for
the
problem
the

use
in
most

flush
each

the

the
previou

keep

cant

ha
more

overhead
than

interrupt
often
take
longer
to

overrun
are
much
more
like
than
under
do
a
soon
a
you
report
to
your
pcmodem
vendor
that
you
are
lose
data
you
may
be
advis
that
you
need
to
upgrad
to
a
more
like
sinc
there
seem
to
be
a
conspiraci
of
ignor
about
thi
issu
youll
get
no
use
advic
at
all
most
of
the
storefront
and
mailord
sourc
i
spoke
with
in
attempt
to
solv
my
own
problem
had
never
heard
the
term
and
mani
didnt
even
know
what
a
uart
wa
even
your
pc
ha
nsa
uart
and
ps
do
or
if
you
can
upgrad
your
mothercom
board
or
add
a
new
com
board
you
may
still
experi
error
and
overrun
becaus
the
standard
microsoft
window
com
driver
dont
take
full
advantag
of
the
window
is
improv
in
thi
regard
over
but
i
still
recommend
a
driver
upgrad
applic
like
procommwin
which
is
what
i
use
can
not
get
around
thi
problem
by
themselv
if
you
have
a
modem
card
you
may
not
have
a
problem
a
the
modem
part
of
the
card
can
be
design
to
be
awar
of
the
state
of
the
uart
and
avoid
overrun
it
howev
i
wouldnt
want
to
bet
that
the
card
design
were
that
clever
and
will
insist
on
a
uart
if
i
ever
buy
a
modem
card
some
modem
card
dont
even
have
convent
uart
but
if
they
are
to
work
with
standard
window
driver
they
need
to
simul

use

what
the

if
thi
is
your

you
may
need

thi

more
