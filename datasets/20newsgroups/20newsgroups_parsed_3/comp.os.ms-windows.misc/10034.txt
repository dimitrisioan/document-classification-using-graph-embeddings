prefer
the
durabl

reliabl
of
the

the
origin
inkjet
with
proven

and
a
solid
background
two
new
inkjet
printer
have
drawn
some
attent
a
new
printer
to
be
introduc
by
hewlettpackard
later
thi
year
around
summertim
and
an
addit
to
the
epson
product
line
their
first

you
will
find
that
after
the
initi
purchas
the

of
refil
or
replac
the
ink
cartridg
are
about
the
same
thi
larg
depend
on
where

so
shop
around
first
sinc
thi

mention
approx
how
mani

there
a
notic

isnt
spectacular
under

use
truetyp

but
neither
is
the
canon
from
what
i
have
seen
qualiti
for
the

is
veri
much
depend
on

qualiti
on
standard

the

have
slightli

but
on
better
qualiti
distinct

paper
thing
look
better
for
most
applic
i
find
copi

fine
still
better
than
dotmatrix
come
with
a

which
seem
to
bypass

probabl
faster

out
can
get

but
unless
the

of

is
a

i
wouldnt

the

cant
be
use
a

etc
the

can

the

give
recommend
depend
on
the
type
of

be
print
text
is
not
so
good
in
thi
mode
problem
aris
when
you
have
a
document
which
contain
both
graphic
and
text
the
rang
of
tone
for
graphic
imag
isnt
brilliant
but
i
think
that
is
more
of
a
limit
with
inkjet
printer
in
gener
from
what
i
have
seen
the
canon
is
similar
in
most
respect
howev
a
printer
definit
worth
look
at
is
the
new
inkjet
from
epson
thi
printer
is
faster
cheaper
and
capabl
of
produc
laserlik
qualiti
on
normal
copier
paper
cant
rememb
the
model
lx
someth
i
think
i
purchas
my
hp
day
befor
the
epson
wa
releas
here
the
introductori
price
on
the
epson
wa
the
same
a
the

about
a
month
ago
i
got
a
canon
bj
i
absolut
love
it
it
is
incred
fast
except
for
print
from
pspice
i
dont
know
if
you
ever
do
stuff
with
that
or
not
most
of
the
stuff
i
print
is
either
from
microsoft
word
for
window
or
just
plain
text
the
onli
problem
ive
had
are
print
headersfoot
the
printer
freak
out
and
print
on
cheap
paper
lot
of
streak
normal
copi

that
is
if
your
nearsight
like
me
the
printer
come
with

i
have
no
other
complaint
the
printer
also
can
act
just
like
some
epson
or
anoth
for
those
archaic
softwar
packag
that
havent
written
a
driver
for

the

i
test
both
with

befor
buy
the

the
featur
that
set

the
deskjet
is
quieter

kri
when

we
look

they
have
near
laser

and
they
are

we
use
both
hp

and
the

bj
i
prefer
the
paper
handl
qualiti
of
the
deskjet
but
i
feel
the
canon
have
superior
print
qualiti
the
ideal
would
be
a
canon
with
a
sheet
feeder
howev
i
did
end
up
buy
a
deskjet
for
home
use
got
too
good
a

anyway
we
are
use
canon
in
high

and
they
are
hold
up
veri
well
out
of
deskjet
and
bj
i
have
onli
had
one
problem
with
a
deskjet
and
that
wa
taken
care
of
veri
quickli
by
hp
nate
whenev
i
buy
anyth
i
look
at
what
the
expert
say
pick
out
the
top
few
and
then
buy
on
whatev
criterion
are
the
most
apt
ive
been
unusu
flush
late
no
beg
letter
pleas
and
so
ive
done
thi
a
few
time
includ
about
four
month
ago
with
inkjet
printer
i
cant
rememb
much
about
the
process
except
that
i
read
about
three
review
of
inkjet
and
that
the
wa
alway
at
or
near
the
top
i
bought
the
c
becaus
of
the
ad
dimens
of
colour
i
intend
to
build
a
multi
medium
machin
at
some
stage
and
have
just
bought
a
colour
scanner
toward
that
although
i
haven
use
the
colour
thing
in
earnest
yet
i
tri
it
out
on
a
coupl
of
window
bitmap
and
i
wa
pleas
with
the
result
i
note
that
even
though
you
can
now
get
the
c
the
one
with
both
colour
and
mono
with
no
need
to
chang
the
cartridg
the
c
and
are
still
readili
avail
at
least
in
the
uk
the
follow
are
my
viewsexperi
i
dont
know
anyth
about
the
canon
except
that
i
came
away
from
review
and
repli
to
a
post
similar
to
your
with
the
idea
that
the
hp
offer
the
best
performancepric
ratio
i
believ
hp
are
the
origin
in
the
field
not
alway
the
ideal
place
to
be
but
the
market
still
young
so
one
assum
they
have
the
expertis
the
c
is
worth
the
extra
oper
in
mono
is
perfectli
accept
and
i
get
good
crisp
reproduct
of
font
from
window
i
use
to
work
for
monotyp
when
they
still
manufactur
typesett
befor
their
american
owner
close
them
down
and
i
can
tell
you
that
in
term
of
definit
dpi
is
pretti
poor
anyway
so
dpi
is
just
a
bit
le
poor
the
hp
come
with
a
reason
set
of
driver
if
you
buy
it
invest
in
the
addit
ram
pack
it
pretti
slow
with
it
god
know
what
it
like
without
i
actual
work
in
germani
and
my
pc
is
home
in
the
uk
so
it
not
in
daili
use
i
would
say
that
apart
from
my
not
read
the
manual
properli
and
have
a
realli
dumb
problem
at
the
start
it
easi
peasi
to
oper
hope
thi
is
of
use
regard
david
just
bought
the
bj
i
thought
the
price
couldnt
be
beat
with
rebat
thru
and
so
far
it
is
compar
even
superior
to
the
deskjet
in
print
qualiti
speed
per

rate
seem
to
be
faster
i
dont
have

i
dont
print
long
doc
though
qualiti
i
think
the
graphic
qualiti
is
excel
print
qualiti
is
excel
a
well
unless
you
use
small
font
and
hold
it
up
close
you
can
see
a
lot
more

than
on
a

the

is
