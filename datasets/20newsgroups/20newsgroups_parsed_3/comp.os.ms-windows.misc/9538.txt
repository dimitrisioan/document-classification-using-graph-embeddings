write
chicogo
is
what
i
want
to
use
it
is
like
nt
a
true
o
with
thrue
multitask
and
multithread
but
ha
much
smaller
hardwar
requir
and
doe
not
meet
dod
secur
spec
but
that
okay
sinc
it
will
probabl
be
more
of
a
client
o
there
are
a
few
otehr
differ
but
those
are
the
main
one
there
wa
an
articl
about
chicogo
in
pc
week
last
august
the
chicogo
and
nt
develop
group
at
microoft
are
in
intens
competit
so
it
is
said
howev
i
think
a
differ
relationship
will
aris
nt
will
be
the
server
netowrk
techonolog
chicogo
will
be
the
client
machin
it
is
entir
possibl
for
differ
os
to
work
togeth
partli
becaus
chicogo
is
just
a
small
nt
think
of
it
that
way
anyway
novel
netwar
creat
an
o
on
the
server
that
is
truli
not
do
so
dont
scorn
the
concept
anyway
dont
expect
it
soon
window
and
do
are
suppos
to
be
releas
next
year
read
see
it
in
so
i
expect
that
chicogo
wont
be
out
til
how
doe
chicago
differ
from
the
sort
of
announc
window
my
understand
ing
at
least
from
the
inbfoworld
accound
of
window
is
that
it
sort
of
nt
litea
fullfledg
oper
system
but
lack
server
and
secur
featur
that
make
nt
such
a
bear
is
w
not
true
multithread
can
anyon
tell
me
how
chicagowindow
would
differ
from
o
x
believ
it
or
not
im
not
tri
to
start
a
flame
war
here
im
simpli
curiou
if
there
is
go
to
be
ani
featur
advantag
in
either
of
these
product
i
do
not
consid
the
fact
that
it
ha
