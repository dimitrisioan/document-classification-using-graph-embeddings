so
much
troubl
with
a

befor
anyon

ani
solut
doe
microsoft
think
they
are
what
everyon
should
be
just
vent
steam
i
think
i
have
the
same
problem
i
think
it
is
caus
by
the
rubber
ball
in
the
mous
which
doesnt
roll
so
smooth
the
detector
in
the
mous
notic
thi
and
whoop
i
hit
a
mine
use
minesweep
i
think
the
solut
will
be
buy
a
new
mous
andor
use
a
mous
pad
wouter
andor
take
the
rubber
ball
out
of
the
mous
should
be
direct
in
the
manual
or
on
the
bottom
of
the
mous
and
clean
it
with
alcohol
isopropyl
i
believ
the
same
alcohol
a
use
for
clean
your
cassett
deck
thi
is
good
to
do
everi
so
often
even
if
you
have
a
mous
pad
dust
still
get
caught
in
the
mous
and
on
the
rubber
ball
a
well
lint
and
other
garbag
may
find
it
way
onto
the
rubber
ball
and
get
into
the
mous
damag
the
horizont
and
vertic
sensor
hope

help
