see
a
seriou
discuss
on
the
best
way
to

a
novel
administr
point
of
view
i
just
got
off

decid
to

describ
below
a
the
most
advantag
instal
if
thi
is
true
and
microsoft
deem
thi
to
be
the
most
prudent
instal
then
i
will
compli
but
id
like
to
hear
it
from
administr
first
the
local
window
instal
window
is
fulli
instal

base
by

still
a
consider
if

move

thi
is
due

instal
be
tie

usernam
in

case
of

user
file
the
discuss
i
would
like
to
know
from
other
administr
with
a
larg
window
userbas
how
they
prefer
set
up
window
person
i
have
setup
numer
instal
use
the
share
setup
all
window
and
applic
file
are
on
the
network
with
littl
or
no
util
of
local
hard
disk
in
fact
i
sold
a
network
on
the
fact
that
the
compani
would
no
longer
need
to
purchas
hard
disk
for
their
workstat
and
thu
save
that
much
more
money
i
would
also
like
to
see
recommend
for
applic
should
app
such
a
word
andor
excel
be
instal
local
regardless
of
how
window
is
instal
again
i
keep
all
file
on
the
network
for
easi
backup
and
administr
but
thi
is
put
all
egg
in
one
basket
if
the
network
crash
work
come
to
a
halt
now
i
am
sure
microsoft
and
i
know
your
out
there
ha
their
own
idea
about
thi
and
their
insight
would
be
of
great
valu
but
i
hope
to
hear
from
peopl
with
actual
work
experi
with
user
and
network
administr
