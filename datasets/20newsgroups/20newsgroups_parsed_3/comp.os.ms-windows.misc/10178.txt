the
other
hand

same
bunch
of
do
and
window
stuff
that
ive
alway
been
run
and
when
i
had
the
slc
thi
is
the
slc
system
run
doswindow
i
had
onli
one
crash
and
it
wa

a
tendenc
to

whenev
i
would
get
larg
file
mb
from

fast
client
dtr
kksec
i
figur
out
the
problem
wa
with
smartdrv
write
bufferingif
i
turn
off
the
write
buffer
everyth
would
work
fine
ftp
under
o
ha
never
lock
though
i
can
even
format
floppi
to
use
the
most
often
cite
exampl
of
the
superior
of
o
for
instanc
im
still
wonder
whi
print
preview
in
a
window
wp
do
lock
up
my
system
yeah
i
guess
im
will
to
admit
that
o
is
somewhat
sensit
to
specif
hardwar
wp
for
do
work
perfectli
fine
on
my
slc
plea
explain
the
onli
time
i
wait
on
anyth
under
window
is
when
im
copi
or
format
a
floppi
or
when
print
and
even
then
not
longi
get
to
page
dump
to
the
printman
per
minut
and
can
still
go
do
thingsslowlywhil
it
do
thisiv
download
with
pp
while
print
well
i
save
all
my
person
file
to
floppi
and
when
i
did
that
under
window
a
floppi
save
of
a
larg
file
hung
up
the
system
i
also
found
it
quit
bothersom
to
have
to
continu
tweak
the
task
option
on
fractint
for
do
whenev
i
want
to
do
a
fractal
comput
in
the
background
and
not
be
abl
to
address
your
memori
better
than
do
not
sure
what
you
mean
here
the
idea
is
that
os
do
session
can
see
more
memori
than
window
do
session
i
let
xpl
a
sharewar
calculu
program
see
around
kb
of
free
convent
memori
which
let
me
do
bigger
symbol
manipul
than
is
possibl
under
straight
do
where
it
would
see
around
kb
of
convent
ram
i
also
found
it
realli
handi
for
my
own
dosbas
program
which
without
ani
rewrit
could
now
handl
larger
data
set
simul
for
more
iter
etc
of
cours
the
point
is
now
moot
sinc
the
o
program
i
now
write
simpli
never
run
into
memori
limit
i
never
program
for
window
so
i
dont
have
much
of
a
comparison
here
though
