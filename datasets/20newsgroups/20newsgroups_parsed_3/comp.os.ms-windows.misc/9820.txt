make
some
program
in
microsoft
c
version
becaus
we
use
some
thirdparti
librari
that
requir
that
i
like
borland
it
seem
to
me
much
more
easier
to
use
than
microsoft
special
the
debugg
i
tri
to
learn
codeview
sometim
but
never
felt
confort
with
it
tc
ve
seem
veri
nice
to

simpl
app
like

objectwindow
book
so
far
no

someth
more
complex
it
work
nice
even
in
my
weak
machin
mhz
mb
ram
but
the
manual
for
the
resourc
workshop
seem
to
be
from
a
differ
version
from
the
workshop
itself
some
of
the
window
that
appear
on
the
manual
have
more
iten
than
