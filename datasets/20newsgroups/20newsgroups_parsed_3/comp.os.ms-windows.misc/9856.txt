dear
friend
the
risc
mean
reduc
instruct
set
comput
the
risc
usual
ha
small
instruct
set
so
a
to
reduc
the
circuit
complex
and
can
increas
the
clock
rate
to
have
a
high
perform
you
can
read
some
book
about
comput
architectur
for
more
inform
about
risc
hmm
not
that
i
am
an
author
on
risc
but
i
clearli
rememb
read
that
the
instruct
set
on
risc
cpu
is
rather
larg
the
differ
is
in
address
mode
risc
instruct
set
are
not
a
orthogon
is
cisc
theoret
suppos
to
be
reduc
not
ani
longer
that
whi
everyon
is
argu
about
risc
v
cisc
person
i
think
cisc
will
win
out
just
take
a
look
at
the
pentium
not
that
i
like
intel
architectur
either
but
that
anoth
stori
bye
do
you
mean
that
the
pentium
is
better
than
a
risc
or
that
it
will
outsel
them
all
if
the
first
you
have
to
rememb
that
intel
cisc
like
the
pentium
are
a
alway
a
gener
away
from
the
best
risc
also
risc
cpu
are
more
costli
becaus
they
are
not
sold
in
the
same
quantiti
not
even
on
the
same
order
but
i
rememb
read
about
year
mayb
about
a
t
from
hypercub
that
did
a
mip
wa
superscallar
and
reorder
it
instruct
itself
so
im
not
sure
but
i
think
the
t
wa
a
mhz
transput
so
ya
tie
a
gazillion
of
them
togeth
to
get
mip
the
newest
is
the
t
which
kick
anyon
butt
havent
seen
them
use
much
though
anyway
to
respond
i
think
the
pentium
cisc
is
better
than
the
more
advanc
risc
eg
like
the
alpha
etc
the
mhz
pentium
ha
approxim
the
same
perform
a
the
superdup
mhz
alpha
here
perform
is
the
weird
specint
that
everyon
refer
to
thi
is
what
i
heard
the
alpha
still
kick
in
the
p
butt
in
fp
again
thi
is
what
i
heard
and
in
the
comput
world
if
you
sell
lot
of
chip
like
intel
and
make
it
faster
like
intel
you
are
the
winner
like
intel
even
though
you
have
a
sucki
architectur
from
over
year
ago
like
intel
if
you
can
make
a
cisc
chip
superscalar
superduperpipelin
superfast
with
the
idea
behind
the
risc
ideolog
you
got
a
cisc
chip
and
then
i
admit
i
cant
see
the
advantag
of
risc
over
cisc
if
the
latest
technolog
is
a
gener
behind
then
it
suck
rel
speak
now
i
may
sound
like
i
like
intel
but
ill
have
to
say
that
the
p
is
some
real
kick
butt
pile
of
si
and
sio
but
i
hope
that
motorola
realli
catch
up
with
the
k
line
or
im
gon
na
start
