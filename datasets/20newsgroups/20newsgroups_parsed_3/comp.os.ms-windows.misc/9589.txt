it
ha
been
said
that
window
nt

is
a
multius
o
a
well
a
multithread
etc
i
certainli
havent
seen
thi
to
be
the
case
there
are
seper
account
for
each
person
and
even
seper
directori
if
that
is
desir
i
dont
see
an
implent
of
simultaneuo
use
though
scott
it
certainli
is
multius
what
i
have
seen
from
the
march
beta
is
that
it
doesnt
yet
come
with
the
stuff
which
exploit
multius
featur
i
rememb
somebodi
from
m
state
that
it
doesnt
allow
two
user
share
one
gui
my
interpret
of
thi
wa
that
one
user
per
consol
but
all
the
network
and
rpc
base
stuff
you
want
i
believ
ftp
and
rlogin
deamon
for
nt
system
will
come
from
third
parti
somebodi
alreadi
ha
a
beta
version
of
an
unsecur
ftpd
on
the
net
there
is
no
reason
whi
one
can
not
write
a
posix
base
shell
like
csh
on
unix
for
remot
login
in
gener
i
like
nt
when
i
check
it
out
it
slow
compar
to
win
just
like
ani
other
real
o
the
beta
version
although
be
slow
bott
up
much
faster
than
my
sun
workstat
window
subsystem
also
start
up
a
lot
faster
than
x
window
i
believ
bill
gate
wa
right
when
he
state
that
nt
wa
not
for
everybodi
after
play
around
with
it
for
a
while
i
wa
convinc
if
i
own
a
busin
use
a
busi
comput
from
ibm
or
some
other
establish
vendor
i
would
consid
move
to

platform
becaus
it
would
provid
a
much
cheaper

you
are

if
you
like
your
do

more
or
le
forget
about
nt
you
can
alway
boot
to

in

that
defeat
the
purpos
of
use
nt
most
of

featur
are
visibl
in
a
network
environ
and
in
such
an
environ
you
cant
reboot
your
machin
at

use
i
would
rather
wait
for
the

base
window
releas
whatev
you
name
it
than
jump

i
expect
most
