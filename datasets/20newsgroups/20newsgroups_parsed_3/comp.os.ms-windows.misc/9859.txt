salesguy
ill
give
your
question
a
shot
the
key
issu
that
i
bought
my
bj
on
wa
ink
dri
speed
you
realli
have
to
tri
aw
hard
to
get
the
bj
ink
to
smear
the
hp
deskjet
need
second
to
complet
dri
in
both
case
howev
do
not
get
your
page
wet
unlik
laser
printer
the
materi
on
your
page
is
ink
not
toner
but
that
should
go
without
say
my
pc
ha
veri
littl
memori
onli
meg
ram
so
the
bj
take
a
littl
while
to
print
but
everi
applic
i
use
take
a
while
to
run
onc
the
comput
is
sole
print
it
pur
like
a
kitten
and
put
page
out
everi
second
depend
on
how
detail
your
graphic
are
the
bj
can
do
window
soft
font
im
assum
that
the
deskjet
can
or
hp
wouldnt
sell
mani
size
is
anoth
factor
the
bj
is
much
smaller
but
the
hp
is
built
like
a
tank
i
bet
the
bj
would
get
damag
first
final
the
print
qualiti
i
love
the
bj
resolut
it
look
like
a
good
laser
qualiti
print
the
hp
ive
usedthey
look
like
ink
not
a
impress
so
i
chose
the
canon
ani
other
opinion
