includ
ever
consid
that
inov
is
not
limit
to
softwarehardwar
true
m
product
do
not
boast
featur
that
m
invent
but
how
mani
product
out
there
by
other
vendor
out
there
are
trueli
innov
in
their
continu
develop
i
think
what
make
m
special
to
the
public
is
thier
innov
price
it
is
true
the
xwindowsmacnext
all
have
some
featur
in
thier
gui
that
are
better
than
m
but
peopl
like
me
cant
afford
them
it
is
true
that
appl
ha
lower
their
price
on
the
low
end
model
but
they
are
just
thatlow
end
system
is
a
better
oper
system
but
the
machin
they
oper
on
just
are
too
expens
for
my
tastesa
unix
platform
is
power
enuf
but
tell
the
common
user
to
set
up
xdefault
i
am
still
confus
on
what
some
of
them
thing
do
and
they
either
puke
or
faint
if
u
think
about
it
low
price
aint
innov
if
u
come
down
to
it
but
for
the
product
it
offer
and
on
the
lower
cost
and
power
hardwar
that
it
run
on
a
compar
to
macsm
is
kinda
innov
oh
yea
i
guess
the
fact
that
the
support
product
and
applic
they
have
garner
for

make
