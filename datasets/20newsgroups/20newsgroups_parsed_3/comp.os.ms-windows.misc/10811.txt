remedi
thi
situat
with

and
it
will
get
better
in

releas
you
do
need
to
be
awar
of
some
histori
howev
in
the
midlat
s
ms
point
of
view
wa
that
o
wa
go
to
take
over
the
world
and
do
would
be
phase
out
a
such
resourc
for
do
and
window
for
that
matter
develop
were
mostli
redirect
to
o
the
theori
wa
to
keep
just
enough
resourc
on
do
to
support
peopl
until
they
start
use
o
so
util
and
such
for
do
fell
by
the
waysid
then
window
hit
the
market
o
flop
x
at
leastx
seem
to
be
do
a
littl
better
but
it
futur
is
still
cloudi
and
peopl
either
stay
with
their
do
x
and
x
app
or
move
to
window
about
that
point
in
time
m
made
it
decis
to
drop
o
for
doswindow
in
the
short
term
and
windowsnt
in
the
long
term
do
much
improv
over
do
x
and
x
wa
the
first
result
of
ms
refocuss
on
do
and
window
version
take
thing
somewhat
further
and
i
suspect
futur
version
will
offer
even
more
in
term
of
real
o
featur
i
work
on
nt
and
have
no
real
clue
about
what
my
cowork
over
in
dosland
are
do
but
i
do
know
that
there
are
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
of
them
than
there
were
a
few
year
ago
dave
of
cours
these
are
my
opinion
if
you
want
ms
opinion
