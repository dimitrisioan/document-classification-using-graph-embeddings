that
if
he
say
someth
long
enough
hey
i
rememb
the
good
old
day
run
o
alpha
with
brief
excel
word
and
a
coupl
intern
app
product
support
databas
client
osbas
email
frontend
life
wa
good
but

wa
also
impract
caus

mass
were
use
window
and
my
job
wa
to
help
the
mass
appar
you
prefer
o
to
window
or
at
least
did
to
window
ye
by
you
last
comment
do
you
mean
that
your
knowledg
of
o
is
date
it
must
be
or
argu
it
definit
date
i
use
o
alpha
when
msft
wa
develop
it
i
suspect
that
the
mass
were
use
window
becaus
they
couldnt
afford
to
use
o
can
you
say
a
much
for
nt
i
prefer
window
becaus
it
wa
more
stabl
faster
than
but
could
still
run
more
app
than
o
again
i
made
thi
choic
befor
wa
releas
but
get
back
to
the
origin
question
do
you
have
ani
data
on
the
rel
avaliabl
or
window
applic
versu
o
applic
or
ani
evid
that
state
support
will
be
drop
by
ani
of
the
abov
no
ive
seen
no
such
data
grow
up
other
compani
are
support
o
make
point
pleas
if
you
see
life
in
term
of
debat
point
i
think
you
need
to
grow
up
ah
ye
i
rememb
the
day
when
we
kid
would
engag
in
orderli
debat
but
our
parent
would
usual
find
out
and
forc
u
to
act
in
the
more
matur
manner
of
heap
invect
and
cast
rock
and
dirt
clod
hee
hee
good
one
it
doesnt
help
microsoft
to
have
employe
i
assum
you
are
due
to
the
org
may
be
wrong
say
such
trivial
thing
on
the
net
so
microsoft
employ
over
employe
walk
into
thi
place
is
not
like
walk
into
the
commerci
there
are
individu
here
you
think
theyll
all
talk
the
same
way
say
the
same
thing
and
help
microsoft
all
the
time
if
so
whi
it
appear
to
me
that
he
is
voic
hi
frustrat
to
an
attitud
he
ha
encount
befor
and
one
that
ive
encount
a
well
i
on
the
other
hand
have
had
no
such
experi
other
than
from
read
thi
thread
you
at
microsoft
are
in
a
uniqu
posit
to
present
fact
hmm
are
you
sure
im
speak
from
my
own
experi
a
an
o
user
certainli
peopl
in
say
the
nt
market
group
would
be
in
a
uniqu
posit
to
present
the
result
of
say
research
on
upcom
nt
and
o
app
v
window
and
msdo
app
part
of
my
point
wa
that
just
caus
one
work
at
microsoft
doe
not
mean
one
ha
access
to
such
data
if
it
exist
but
prefer
to
make
baseless
claim
or
attack
to
poster
i
must
make
the
same
conclus
a
he
i
will
confess
to
at
time
attack
the
poster
usenet
account
are
not
restrict
to
the
marketroid
theyr
open
to
ani
fulltim
and
are
primarili
for
recreat
purpos
yeah
some
of
u
are
like
to
answer
a
question
or
hop
into
a
debat
or
make
stupid
comment
you
know
like
human
be
im
sorri
thi
newsgroup
is
onli
for
opress
hacker
and
strand
extraterrestri
not
human
how
about
altmicrosofthuman
you
seem
to
discount
other
anyway
again
my
point
wa
that
not
all
microsofti
are
here
to
sell
reader
on
our
product
which
would
conflict
with
the
noad
philosophi
of
usenet
nor
do
we
necessarili
have
access
to
info
that
other
have
i
also
get
tire
of
peopl
assum
that
microsofti
are
