re
question
about
do
extern
join
command
in
articl
the
author
write
i
am
set
up
my
dosunix
box
on
a
m
ide
and
a
m
scsi
drive
and
wa
wonder
about
the
use
of
the
msdo
join
command
i
like
the
way
it
set
thing
up
sinc
i
wont
have
to
stick
with
the
c
d
e
crap
that
do
enforc
i
like
how
it
would
mimic
mount
point
of
unix
filesystem
i
have
heard
that
there
were
problem
with
use
it
or
at
least
under
older
version
of
do
plea
tell
i
have
been
use
the
join
command
for
mani
year
now
mostli
with
good
success
in
duplic
unixstyl
file
mount
you
will
hear
lot
of
peopl
cur
join
becaus
they
confus
it
with
the
do
append
command
a
trueli
gnarli
hack
but
dont
believ
them
you
also
will
hear
peopl
say
that
microsoft
recommend
that
you
not
use
join
but
in
microsoft
window
workgroup
resourc
toolkit
the
follow
appear
join
an
msdo
util
work
fine
with
window
for
workgroup
if
you
do
not
chang
the
state
of
the
join
drive
dure
a
window
for
workgroup
session
thi
includ
ad
or
remov
join
drive
from
within
window
for
workgroup
we
recommend
that
you
do
not
use
join
when
run
window
setup
or
window
for
workgroup
within
thi
caveat
join
appear
to
be
valid
under
window
howev
i
have
found
a
coupl
of
applic
that
dont
deal
well
with
filesystem
that
have
been
mount
use
join
in
particular
the
worst
offend
is
word
for
window
x
it
get
veri
confus
when
you
edit
and
then
tri
to
save
a
file
on
a
join
drive
it
want
to
creat
the
save
file
a
nnnnntmp
in
the
current
dir
then
delet
the
old
file
and
renam
the
nnnnntmp
file
to
the
doc
file
unfortun
wfw
usual
write
the
nnnnntmp
file
in
some
idiot
place
other
than
the
current
directori
often
in
the
root
dir
of
the
join
filesystem
but
not
alway
then
after
delet
the
origin
doc
file
it
cant
find
the
nnnnntmp
file
to
renam
it
unless
you
search
your
disk
system
the
document
is
gone
i
have
also
found
subtl
problem
use
the
mk
toolkit
from
a
do
box
when
join
filesystem
are
present
i
use
to
join
ctemp
with
a
meg
ramdisk
but
mk
sometim
get
confus
when
do
an
l
on
the
ctemp
dir
and
miss
some
file
in
the
temp
dir
thi
is
difficult
to
reproduc
but
it
goe
away
total
when
join
is
not
use
i
think
thi
is
a
window
problem
rather
than
mkss
sinc
it
work
ok
under
raw
do
so
i
would
suggest
that
you
can
use
join
but
be
awar
that
it
may
not
be
a
robust
you
would
like
wouldnt
it
be
real
great
to
mount
network
drive
ie
z
under
the
main
file
tree
rather
than
have
all
those
darn
drive
letter
unfortun
join
wont
let
you
do
it
there
wa
talk
on
the
net
about
a
simpl
patch
to
let
join
work
on
network
drive
but
i
dont
rememb
the
sourc
it
too
bad
the
join
command
is
not
better
implement
sinc
it
would
avoid
use
all
those
stupid
drive
letter
i
realiz
that
messdo
wa
meant
for
casual
even
ignor
user
so
mount
all
the
drive
in
one
file
tree
might
be
confus
but
it
look
like
m
is
go
to
carri
thi
over
into
window
nt
anoth
o
meant
for
casual
even
igor
user
not
with
all
it
old
famili
system
baggag
mayb
m
need
a
recoveri
group
so
they
can
get
