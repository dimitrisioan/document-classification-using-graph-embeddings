write
hi
all
ha
anybodi
tri
to
compil
ctrltest
from
the
mfcsampl
directori
after
compil
the
mfclib
with
bwc
seem
to
me
that
bwc
isnt
abl
to
distinguish
pointer
to
overload
function
for
exampl
imagin
the
follow
overload
function
void
samenam
void
void
samenam
int
after
tri
the
whole
day
i
think
with
bwc
it
imposs
to
take
the
adress
of
one
of
the
abov
two
function
and
assign
it
to
a
properli
defin
function
pointer
am
i
right
ha
anybodi
el
had
thi
problem
thanx
i
think
you
may
be
chase
the
wrong
problem
i
dont
think
it
is
the
function
overload
at
all
i
do
that
sort
of
thing
all
of
the
time
in
bc
without
a
hitch
the
big
problem
i
have
encount
in
port
mfc
to
bc
is
that
fact
that
mfc
depend
on
a
coupl
of
invalid
c
assumpt
i
have
never
gotten
the
entir
ctrltest
app
to
run
under
bc
but
the
reason
is
that
m
make
some
bad
assumpt
about
the
order
in
which
staticglob
object
are
initi
ie
some
object
are
get
access
befor
they
are
initi
the
problem
is
in
the
ownerdraw
menu
code
somewher
if
you
comment
out
that
section
all
other
piec
of
ctrltest
work
fine
two
other
major
gotcha
i
have
found
use
mfc
under
bc
the
cfileopenflag
enum
use
hardcod
number
for
the
open
mode
rather
than
the
manifest
constant
defin
in
fcntrlh
which
differ
between
msc
and
bc
all
of
the
mfc
collect
class
depend
on
anoth
bad
c
assumpt
that
a
refer
to
a
base
object
can
use
be
in
place
of
a
refer
to
a
deriv
object
true
for
pointer
not
for
refer
i
am
sure
there
are
other
problem
along
the
same
line
but
i
have
not
encount
them
yet
i
have
not
seen
mfc
yet
but
i
hope
that
some
of
these
will
be
address
if
they
are
not
all
of
ms
hype
about
portabl
to
other
vendor
compil
will
be
just
that
if
these
were
my
employ
opinion
i
wouldnt
be
post
them
whoever
said
