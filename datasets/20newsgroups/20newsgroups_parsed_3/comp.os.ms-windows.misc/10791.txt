wont
realli
do
what
it
say
ie
run

o
will
not
run
window

someth
that
most
larger

but
o
which
is
suppos
to
be
in
beta
test
is
suppos
to
i
have
heard
that
o
beta
is
avail
via
ftp
and
i
wa
wonder
if
anyon

where
to
obtain
a
copi
i
would
appreci
ani
inform
a

it
will
be
releas
at
comdex
that
day
it
will
run

if
you
cant
wait
then
you
can
ftp
a
month
old
beta
version
from
ftposnmsuedu
but
thi
version
is
probabl
a

slower

in

that
