my
point
wa
that
not
all
microsofti
are
here
to
sell
reader
on
our
product
which
would
conflict
with
the
noad
philosophi
of
usenet
nor
do
we
necessarili
have
access
to
info
that
other
have
it
certainli
smack
of
that
rememb
the
poll
that
you
quot
say
that
you
had
seen
a
of
user
be
satisfi
with
do
it
wa
and
actual
anoth
msdo
team
member
post
it
note
that
peopl
not
on
the
msdo
team
would
not
necessarili
know
about
that
or
care
to
recal
how
unbias
the
sampl
set
wa
when
i
heard
those
number
i
wonder
how
they
got
them
have
work
in
product
support
and
know
that
the
typic
support
caller
ha
veri
littl
posit
to
say
about
the
product
i
figur
it
wasnt
from
there
so
i
wander
over
to
the
market
folk
and
ask
and
i
wa
told
it
wa
from
a
survey
of
regist
user
and
i
post
that
on
the
net
when
peopl
ask
where
the
figur
came
from
that
post
sure
look
like
fudand
come
from
a
microsofti
well
it
sure
seem
like
someth
wa
not
on
level
hmm
i
figur
if
chuck
post
the
number
whi
not
includ
where
they
came
from
i
also
find
it
interest
that
postit
info
is
fear
uncertainti
doubt
advocaci
is
good
but
spread
fud
to
advoc
your
favorit
o
is
veri
uneth
especi
when
you
have
a
vest
interest
in
the
success
of
that
o
i
think
youv
got
me
confus
with
someon
els
i
dont
pretend
that
msdo
provid
what
all
peopl
need
or
that
other
os
includ
unix
o
dont
provid
use
andor
necessari
featur
i
also
dont
push
peopl
to
use
msdo
i
even
post
in
composmsdosmisc
that
i
suggest
wait
befor
instal
a
new
o
esp
if
you
have
troubl
support
is
alway
overload
dure
releas
unless
the
sale
are
a
total
bomb
i
also
get
tire
of
peopl
assum
that
microsofti
are
like
member
of
the
borg
that
is
becaus
their
action
seem
to
invit
thi
opinion
never
seen
more
defens
peopl
in
my
life
i
aint
say
some
of
u
dont
get
defens
sometim
do
you
realli
think
msdo
get
ani
more
respect
within
microsoft
than
outsid
it
i
just
mean
we
all
arent
cut
out
of
the
same
dough
with
the
same
cooki
cutter
we
dont
all
think
alik
yeah
chuckst
and
i
have
some
insid
info
on
msdo
doesnt
mean
that
everyon
els
doe
serious
speak
it
is
a
shame
that
m
techi
employe

the
heat
for

action
most
of
which
are
perpetr
by
the
manag
and
market
i
am
sure
that
they
are
veri
talent
etc
i
have
not
doubt
about
their
abil
just
about
