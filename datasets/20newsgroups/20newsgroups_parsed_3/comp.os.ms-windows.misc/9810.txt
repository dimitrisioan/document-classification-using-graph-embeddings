atm
in
articl
lamont
down
write
so
good
that
there
isnt
ani
diff
whether
or
not
atmanag
is
turn
on
or
not
is
it
worth
it
to
run
atm
at
all
especi
with
these
better
printer
technolog
and
tt
there
are
some
font
that
are
onli
avail
a
p
font
if
you
have
a
p
font
that
you
want
to
use
use
atm
otherwis
it
is
a
wast
of
system
resourc
or
if
you
need
to
use
a
servic
bureau
and
theyr
onli
set
up
to
use
type
font
from
what
ive
heard
pure
hearsay
the
result
of
output
tt
font
a
type
is
not
a
good
a
use
highqual
type
font
in
the
first
place
unless
you
print
to
file
with
the
correct
resolut
set
for
the
final
output
devic
imag
setter
a
problem
with
tt
font
in
window
is
that
they
do
get
convert
to
t
format
ok
and
the
hint
is
even
use
while
thi
is
done
but
the
result
t
font
are
not
hint
the
result
is
that
they
will
work
fine
on
a
devic
of
the
resolut
assum
by
the
printer
driver
when
the
p
file
is
gener
but
they
will
not
look
good
when
print
at
a
differ
resolut
so
when
you
print
to
an
attach
p
printer
with
the
p
driver
set
up
for
thi
printer
result
may
be
quit
good
but
if
you
take
a
p
file
made
for
that
printer
and
run
it
on
a
devic
of
differ
resolut
such
a
an
imag
setter
then
the
result
may
not
be
so
good
