noth
oh
well
reboot
enjoy
the
checkdisk
time
in
thi
case
a
part
of
the
o
crash
not
onli
itself
but
o
entir
which
isnt
even
smart
enough
to
tell
when
it
been
compromis
i
guess
in
everyday
specif
today
use
o
give
each
window
app
a
vdm
and
they
cant
touch
each
other
or
gener
anyth
they
arent
suppos
to
have
that
the
idea
anyway
in
truth
when
a
program
crash
on
o
it
will
bring
the
system
down
with
it
the
program
that
would
just
gpf
under
window
do
the
same
under
o
but
program
that
are
fine
under
do
and
window
bring
o
scream
to
a
halt
task
protect
or
no
for
instanc
im
still
wonder
whi
print
preview
in
a
window
wp
do
lock
up
my
system
it
work
fine
under
do
or
even
in
a
do
box
under
window
admittedli
it
doesnt
crash
if
i
run
wp
full
screen
but
the
first
time
thi
bug
big
me
it
bit
hard
if
window
work
for
you
then
great
mayb
thi
is
whi
some
peopl
dont
see
whi
o
is
the
o
of
choic
if
window
doesnt
crash
on
you
and
you
dont
mind
wait
on
each
task
pleas
explain
the
onli
time
i
wait
on
anyth
under
window
is
when
im
copi
or
format
a
floppi
or
when
print
and
even
then
not
longi
get
to
page
dump
to
the
printman
per
minut
and
can
still
go
do
thingsslowlywhil
it
do
thisiv
download
with
pp
while
print
and
not
be
abl
to
adress
your
memori
better
than
do
not
sure
what
you
mean
here
o
see
meg
us
or
six
of
these
for
it
own
use
more
if
you
want
to
count
wino
window
see
meg
us
or
more
like
if
you
count
the
disk
cach
a
i
am
for
o
for
itself
if
memori
effici
were
a
big
issu
pc
geo
would
be
the
current
king
of
the
intel
desktop
some
of
the
key
reason
for
use
o
are
gone
i
probabl
would
still
use
it
but
it
would
be
more
of
an
even
fight
on
the
other
hand
i
am
final
abl
to
say
with
some
confid
that
both
o
and
window
have
a
bit
of
hardwar
sensit
to
them
for
instanc
the
machin
i
am
sit
at
run
both
fine
while
the
machin
next
to
me
constantli
lock
up
under
window
but
ran
o
without
a
hitch
onc
i
got
it
through
a
crash
instal
on
the
whole
id
say
o
is
a
whole
lot
more
sensit
than
window
but
there
are
i
suppos
machin
that
window
just
doesnt
like
wittism
of
th
week
i
think
that
it
wrong
to
believ
in
an
ism
you
should
believ
in
yourself
ferrish
bueller
wasnt
thi
ferri
bueller
there
are
stupid
law
and
then
there
are
stupid
than
normal
law
