repost
and
summar
for
your
inform
or
addit
comment
thi
is
long
i
have
mb
of
memori
on
my
sx
mhz
an
intel
math
coprocessor
and
a
mb
hard
drive
with
mb
free
no
compress
i
have
been
run
mathcad
under
window
in
enhanc
mode
with
a
mb
ram
drive
mbmb
smart
drive
and
no
swap
file
perman
or
temporari
for
sever
month
i
am
interest
in
the
faster
mathcad
but
i
am
concern
about
report
swap
file
requir
and
the
legitimaci
of
mathsoft
claim
about
increas
speed
to
sx
user
will
mathcad
run
without
a
swap
file
or
insist
that
i
use
a
swap
file
so
far
in
respons
to
a
le
detail
descript
of
my
setup
or
in
unrel
post
the
more
inform
answer
on
the
net
or
by
email
appear
to
be
by
david
a
fuess
accord
to
mathsoft
no
mathcad
use
the
swap
file
extens
so
a
not
to
overburden
the
physic
resourc
they
say
thi
is
actual
a
win
featur
a
figur
of
mb
wa
indic
to
me
a
a
minimum
but
you
might
tri
anyway
by
bert
tyler
im
not
all
that
certain
that
mathcad
is
the
culprit
here
i
have
a
dx
with
mb
of
main
memori
le
mb
for
a
ramdisk
and
a
bit
for
a
do
session
that
is
open
a
part
of
the
startup
process
which
i
have
been
run
without
ani
swapfil
when
i
instal
the
win
subsystem
from
the
march
beta
of
the
nt
sdk
the
win
subsystem
itself
demand
the
presenc
of
a
swapfil
the
onli
win
program
ive
run
to
date
is
the
bit
version
of
freecel
that
came
with
that
subsystem
i
gave
window
a
small
temporari
swapfil
im
leeri
of
file
that
must
remain
in
fix
locat
on
my
hard
disk
and
all
seem
well
by
brian
c
anderson
what
is
win
i
upgrad
to
mathcad
and
it
instal
a
directori
for
win
under
windowssystem
dure
the
upgrad
it
told
me
that
win
wa
requir
by
steven
v
case
mathcad
make
use
of
the
win
librari
youv
probabl
heard
about
win
it
is
a
bit
window
librari
that
provid
much
of
the
window
nt
function
no
support
for
thread
and
multitask
and
such
but
can
be
run
under
window
by
thoma
c
rhyne
i
also
have
mb
of
ram
and
inde
mathcad
insist
on
a
perman
swapfil
it
would
not
run
otherwis
by
greg
bishop
mathcad
absolut
requir
mb
ram
with
mb
swap
file
or
mb
ram
with
mb
swap
file
it
will
give
you
a
not
enough
memori
error
if
the
swap
file
is
le
than
mb
it
is
a
major
resourc
hog
if
you
do
not
load
the
symbol
processor
or
the
smart
math
it
take
about
mb
of
ram
real
or
virtual
just
to
load
again
due
to
the
win
librari
so
it
seem
that
in
addit
to
the
system
requir
shown
on
mathsoft
advertis
for
that
you
need
a
swap
file
possibl
a
big
a
mb
look
like
i
would
just
need
an
mb
swap
file
and
would
need
to
choos
or
can
i
between
a
faster
perman
swap
file
or
a
slower
temporari
swap
file
appar
a
win
subsystem
ship
with
mathcad
how
much
disk
space
doe
thi
requir
i
also
receiv
these
answer
by
dale
hampl
if
youv
got
meg
of
ram
whi
not
configur
meg
a
a
ram
disk
for
mathcad
do
permit
differ
bootup
configur
can
mathcad
win
be
configur
to
use
such
a
ram
drive
instead
of
a
swap
file
if
not
i
dont
see
how
use
do
for
an
altern
bootup
would
provid
window
with
thi
swap
file
some
time
back
i
rememb
a
discus
about
the
issu
of
use
a
ram
drive
to
support
a
swap
file
but
i
thought
thi
involv
slower
mb
system
i
have
do
but
for
variou
reason
have
not
yet
done
a
full
instal
by
the
way
is
a
full
instal
of
do
requir
to
avail
oneself
of
the
altern
bootup
featur
which
file
from
the
instal
disk
are
requir
by
wildstrom
presum
you
mean
without
a
perman
swap
file
if
window
need
a
swap
file
it
will
upo
and
creat
one
if
a
perman
one
doesnt
exist
perman
is
gener
faster
though
i
dont
know
whi
mathcad
wouldnt
be
happi
with
either
typev
is
and
so
should
ani
program
conform
to
the
win
specif
so
far
mb
ha
been
enough
ram
to
avoid
the
overhead
of
run
ani
swap
file
i
have
been
run
mathcad
under
window
without
one
