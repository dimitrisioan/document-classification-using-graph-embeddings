here
is
a

support
to
defend
the
pathet
state
of
do
a
an
upgrad
distribut
it
is
a
long
stori
but
would
make
good
read
for
those
who
are
interest
in
know
the
potenti
pitfal
of
upgrad
to
do
that
i
have
been
abl
to
notic
after

about

after
updgrad
to
do
i
could
not
understand
whi
certain
thing
becam
so
slow
especi
after
i
decid
to
tri
dblspace
in
the
process
of
find
out
whi
i
discov
some
interest
thing
disk
perform
with
doubl
space
and
smart
drive
while
most
thing
did
not
appear
to
slow
down
most
of
the
time
certain
applic
appear
to
run
veri
much
slower
what
wa
interest
is
that
command
like
chkdsk
and
defrag
were
run
far
too
slowli
to
consid
them
use
by
ani
standard
i
suspect
doubl
space
d
and
decid
to
measur
it
impact
on
my
system
use
winbenchtm
the
real
disk
winmark
of
for
the
origin
system
a
ship
from
factori
with
do
and
windoww
becam
when
upgrad
to
do
with
d
thu
there
is
an
effect
perform
degrad
of
more
than
percent
which
did
not
realli
surpris
me
becaus
i
knew
that
d
compress
must
cost
someth
specif
for
short
sequenti
read
up
to
byte
d
actual
improv
transfer
rate
by
about
becaus
cpu
be
faster
than
io
more
cpu
cycl
need
for
d
is
more
than
compens
by
save
in
io
cycl
howev
for
all
other
case
particularli
larg
random
write
the
transfer
take
up
to
three
time
a
long
while
the
perform
depend
on
the
type
of
access
ie
random
or
sequenti
small
or
larg
transfer
unit
on
the
averag
base
on
winbench
assumpt
the
disk
slow
down
to
half
it
speed
the
test
alon
done
in
real
mode
see
winbench
and
with
smartdrv
on
do
not
say
much
except
that
it
help
to
put
into
those
subject
statement
like
there
is
no
notic
differ
in
perform
or
even
that
it
will
speed
up
disk
access
when
you
have
a
fast
cpu
and
slow
disk
io
thi
explain
whi
some
applic
ran
markedli
slower
but
not
whi
chkdsk
and
defrag
the
latter
especi
too
so
long
doubl
space
and
window
dblspace
will
not
run
at
all
from
within
window
not
even
if
you
want
to
onli
to
get
inform
not
modifi
anyth
or
for
that
matter
even
check
on
it
usag
tri
fasthelp
dblspace
in
a
do
box
within
window
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
from
the
error
messag
you
get
how
narrow
mind
can
a
program
get
i
wonder
ye
thi
inform
can
be
obtain
through
the
mstoolsdd
addon
to
file
manag
but
thi
mstool
dll
doe
not
understand
a
compress
floppi
use
the
do
supplement
util
to
creat
a
compress
floppi
if
you
dont
know
how
to
do
defragment
is
incompat
with
ti
apm
defragment
seem
to
take
too
much
time
even
so
i
wait
patient
till
it
finish
and
then
ran
it
again
to
just
to
confirm
thi
confirm
dblspace
def
command
for
the
m
drive
should
take
no
more
than
second
much
faster
on
other
defragment
i
have
use
but
it
took
minut
i
discov
that
if
i
move
the
mous
defragment
check
ran
faster
the
figur
tick
more
rapidli
it
dawn
on
me
that
thi
had
to
do
with
ti
batteri
saver
advanc
power
manag
apm
modul
which
slow
the
clock
down
when
it
think
that
the
cpu
is
idl
and
it
obvious
thought
d
defragment
wa
an
idl
process
after
disabl
the
ti
power
saver
thi
oper
took
onli
second
microsft
programm
think
ti
and
gateway
nomad
user
are
idiot
in
the
readmetxt
file
you
can
find
the
the
follow
run
microsoft
backup
with
ti
and
gateway
nomad
comput
to
avoid
a
conflict
between
the
turbo
featur
and
microsoft
backup
for
window
or
msdo
add
a
l
switch
to
the
devic
command
in
your
configsi
that
load
the
batterypro
file
or
befor
you
run
microsoft
backup
type
setpow
l
at
the

prompt
if
you
check
ti
manual
on
the

you
will
realis
that
it
mean
disabl
all
power

disabl
a

out
not
onli
doe
ti

interfer
with
microsoft

a
the
readmetxt
claim
but
chkdsk
and
dblspace
and
who
know
what
els
are
crippl
by
the
ti
power
saver
it
is
obviou
that
there
is
not
such
thing
a
apm
specif
if
there
inde
is
such
a
thing
then
either
microsoft
programm
or
ti
programm
dont
know
how
to
read
these
specif
you
dont
have
to
guess
a
to
who
are
the
idiot
by
the
way
if
you
run
the
advanc

powerex

thi

be
the

on
my

when
i
am
run
noth
window
with

manag
in

doe
that
mean
that
window
take
up
of
my
cpu
all
for

and
that
i
have
at
best
onli
left
for
use
work
is
such
an
overhead
justifi
whether
or
not
window
is
an
oper
system
or
just
anoth
user
interfac
in
do
alon
it
report
idl
time
look
like
window
is
a
good
exampl
of
busi
wait
type
of
packag
that
i
like
my
student
to
studi
a
the
classic
neg
exampl
of
our
time
microsoft
programm
do
not
know
batch
program
i
like
to
structur
my
startup
script
and
thu
have
the
equival
of
addpath
statement
like
thi
set
pathcdo
set
pathcetcbinpathcbin
set
pathcetcwindowspathcwindow
set
pathpathcbccbin
set
pathpathmous
even
though
the
new
do
wa
instal
in
the
same
directori
a
the
old
one
ie
cdo
do
instal
program
modif
each
and
everi
path
statement
and
prepend
cdo
to
it
valu
a
a
result
my
result
path
ha
so
mani
do
if
the
instal
program
want
to
remov
the
old
do
path
and
add
the
new
do
path
clearli
it
ha
to
onli
scan
for
the
path
statement
conta
the
old
do
directori
and
replac
it
by
the
new
do
path
even
thi
should
onli
be
done
if
the
new
do
is
instal
in
a
directori
differ
from
the
old
one
be
upgrad
instead
the
microsoft
programm
if
you
can
call
thi
person
one
decid
to
meddl
everi
path
statement
i
had
in
the
autoexec
and
prepend
do
to
the
valu
i
wonder
if
microsoft
is
so
despar
that
it
would
not
fire
programm
who
are
incap
of
the
thought
process
i
start
a
thread
on
thi
when
do
came
up
and
the
microsoft
repres
in
singapor
call
me
about
thi
poster
in
fact
he
specif
said
hi
u
counterpart
saw
the
poster
and
relay
the
inform
to
him
a
he
did
not
have
access
to
internet
now
that
ha
not
chang
one
bit
in
fact
if
you
have
a
path
statement
with
path
alreadi
in
it
is
it
not
obviou
that
the
thi
statement
should
not
be
touch
for
ani
reason
a
anoth
exampl
of
the
inabl
of
microsoft
programm
to
understand
batch
program
i
had
the
mous
driver
invok
a
set
mousecetcmous
set
pathpathmous
loadhigh
mousemousecom
guess
what
memmak
did
it
replac
the
last
statement
with
lh
cetcmousemousecom
whi
is
it
so
difficult
just
to
replac
loadhigh
with
lh
and
it
paramet
without
touch
the
rest
of
the
line
i
do
not
understand
do
softwar
qualiti
do
is
the
onli
oper
system
i
know
in
which
under
normal
usag
you
end
up
creat
a
file
that
you
can
not
get
rid
of
use
of
the
command
that
come
with
it
i
am
deliber
be
cryptic
about
thi
i
challeng
microsoft
to
use
all
it
programm
to
catch
thi
bug
and
publish
it
if
they
dont
within
a
week
i
will
post
how
you
can
creat
thi
ghost
file
sure
if
i
can
pick
thi
bug
without
even
look
for
it
after
use
a
particular
command
onli
twice
i
am
sure
two
dozen
microsoft
idiot
programm
randomli
bang
on
their
keyboard
over
a
week
could
find
it
that
is
what
i
wa
told
how
microsoft
test
the
qualiti
of
their
product
i
think
it
is
funni
that
microsoft
ha
found
way
to
test
qualiti
when
it
is
accept
in
the
industri
that
qualiti
can
not
be
test
but
can
onli
be
built
into
the
product
no
wonder
they
can
not
provid
ani
form
of
guarante
on
their
product
not
even
a
decent
list
of
bug
that
will
prevent
score
of
user
from
destroy
their
disk
beyond
repair
also
if
you
run
dblspace
def
often
enough
repeatedli
when
the
disk
is
fulli
defrag
you
may
get
error
that
wa
creat
by
the

i
got
my
