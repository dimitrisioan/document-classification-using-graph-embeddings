write
when
i
use
a
name
such
a
rosevcrosehulmanedu
initi
nameserv
queri
for
rosevc
nameserv
queri
time
out
when
i
use
the
ip
number
local
host
or
gateway
not
respond
i
know
the
nameserv
is
correct
and
the
router
is
correct
they
work
fine
use
ncsa
telnetftp
they
are
work
ok
but
your
definit
in
qvtnetini
and
qvthostrc
are
incorrect
see
below
the
doc
said
if
you
are
run
concurr
packet
softwar
you
need
to
load
pktmux
doe
thi
appli
to
me
no
i
dont
think
so
you
are
use
qvtnet
and
novel
concurr
arent
you
they
use
differ
packet
type
so
qvtnet
tcpip
and
novel
ipxspx
should
be
abl
to
coexist
just
fine
pktmux
is
requir
if
you
are
use
differ
tcpippackag
concurr
thi
is
the
qvthostrc
file
there
is
the
first
problem
you
didnt
specifi
hostnam
just
ipaddress
your
file
should
look
like
thi
name
of
your
nameserv
name
of
your
router
thi
is
the
begin
of
the
winqvtini
file
net
nameswartzjhtestrosehulmanedu
here
you
should
onli
specifi
your
hostnam
without
the
domain
part
router
instead
use
routernam
of
your
router
a
specifi
in
your
qvthostrc
i
know
the
releas
note
for
say
that
ip
address
should
work
also
but
appar
they
dont
nameserv
here
too
you
should
use
the
hostnam
of
the
nameserv
instead
of
the
ip
address
it
work
fine
for
me
that
way
although
i
could
not
specifi
more
than
one
nameserv
the
relnot
say
it
should
be
possibl
to
specifi
up
to
three
nameserv
separ
by
comma
but
it
didnt
work
hope
it
