a

ha
multiprocessor
support
and
is
primarili
a

it
overhead
is
too
high
for

if

the
fact
that

isnt
an

speak
of
overhead
it
requir
at
least
a
with
meg
of
ram
it
iwll
run
with
but
that
like
run
o
with
meg
and
that
just
to
run
it
also
i
have
heard
that
the
system
file
take
up
meg
and
it
is
recommend
that
your
drive
be
a
half
gig
the
skd
is
distribut
on
cdrom
i
ran
it
on
a
with
mram
and
it
did
a
ton
of
disk
swap
with
a
m
virtual
memori
page
file
it
function
but
it
crawl
thi
wa
the
oct
build
i
upgrad
the
machin
to
m
and
the
perform
is
good
at
that
point
i
instal
the
march
build
consid
they
are
probabl
still
work
on
the
featur
set
and
havent
done
a
lot
of
fine
tune
to
the
code
yet
chicogo
is
what
i
want
to
use
it
is
like
nt
a
true
o
with
thrue
multitask
and
multithread
but
ha
much
smaller
hardwar
requir
and
doe
not
meet
dod
secur
spec
but
that
okay
sinc
it
will
probabl
be
more
of
a
client
o
there
are
a
few
otehr
differ
but
those
are
the
main
one
there
wa
an
articl
about
chicogo
in
pc
week
last
august
the
chicogo
and
nt
develop
group
at
microoft
are
in
intens
competit
so
it
is
said
howev
i
think
a
differ
relationship
will
aris
nt
will
be
the
server
netowrk
techonolog
chicogo
will
be
the
client
machin
it
is
entir
possibl
for
differ
os
to
work
togeth
partli
becaus
chicogo
is
just
a
small
nt
think
of
it
that
way
anyway
novel
netwar
creat
an
o
on
the
server
that
is
truli
not
do
so
dont
scorn
the
concept
anyway
dont
expect
it
soon
window
and
do
are
suppos
to
be
releas
next
year
read
see
it
in
so
i
expect
that
chicogo
wont
be
out
til
i
have
littl
info
on
chicago
so
i
cant
make
a
comparison
is
it
in
beta
is
there
anyon
out
there
who
ha
test
both
and
care
to
make
a
comparison
just
my
