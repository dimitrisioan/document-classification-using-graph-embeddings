re
question
on
eisa
video
board
perform
in
charl
allen
write
from
articl
by
christoph
f
wroten
i
have
an
eisa
machin
and
i
just
do
not
understand
whi
most
eisa
video
card
onli
match
the
perform
of
their
isa
counterpart
for
instanc
the
eisa
orchid
pro
design
ii
is
onli
about
a
fast
a
the
isa
diamond
speedstar
plu
which
isnt
what
i
would
call
fast
i
dont
understand
whi
eisa
video
card
arent
a
a
group
on
the
same
level
of
perform
a
local
bu
card
given
that
eisa
video
card
have
a
bit
bu
to
move
data
around
instead
of
isa
bit
good
question
answer
the
eisa
bu
doe
move
bit
rather
than
isa
but
it
still
move
it
at
about
the
speed
a
the
isa
bu
i
think
that
either
or
mhz
the
local
bu
design
also
move
bit
like
the
eisa
but
they
move
the
data
at
the
cpu
speed
up
to
mhz
so
on
a
mhz
cpu
the
local
bu
is
move
bit
data
at
mhz
and
the
eisa
is
move
bit
data
at
or
mhz
so
the
local
bu
should
be
to
time
faster
than
eisa
on
a
mhz
cpu
eisa
should
be
about
two
mayb
time
a
fast
a
isa
i
would
expect
the
eisa
board
to
be
more
than
twice
a
fast
a
the
isa
board
not
onli
are
you
move
data
on
a
path
twice
a
wide
at
least
but
there
is
a
differ
in
the
number
of
clock
requir
for
bu
transact
between
the
two
bus
most
isa
board
requir
multipl
clock
per
bu
transact
typic
thi
is
around
eisa
board
are
suppos
to
be
abl
to
burst
at
a
rate
so
i
would
expect
perform
to
be
xx
that
of
an
isa
card
so
i
guess
for
me
the
question
is
unansw
still
i
would
expect
him
to
be
abl
to
see
a
x
speed
differ
and
he
appar
doe
not
insist
on
perfect
safeti
is

dont
