dear
friend
the
risc
mean
reduc
instruct
set
comput
the
risc
usual
ha
small
instruct
set
so
a
to
reduc
the
circuit
complex
and
can
increas
the
clock
rate
to
have
a
high
perform
you
can
read
some
book
about
comput
architectur
for
more
inform
about
risc
hmm
not
that
i
am
an
author
on
risc
but
i
clearli
rememb
read
that
the
instruct
set
on
risc
cpu
is
rather
larg
the
differ
is
in
address
mode
risc
instruct
set
are
not
a
orthogon
is
cisc
theoret
suppos
to
be
reduc
not
ani
longer
that
whi
everyon
is
argu
about
risc
v
cisc
person
i
think
cisc
will
win
out
just
take
a
look
at
the
pentium
not
that
i
like
intel
architectur
either
but
that
anoth
stori
bye
do
you
mean
that
the
pentium
is
better
than
a
risc
or
that
it
will
outsel
them
all
if
the
first
you
have
to
rememb
that
intel
cisc
like
the
pentium
are
a
alway
a
gener
away
from
the
best
risc
also
risc
cpu
are
more
costli
becaus
they
are
not
sold
in
the
same
quantiti
not
even
on
the
same
order
but
i
rememb
read
about
year
mayb
about
a
t
from
hypercub
that
did
a
mip
wa
superscallar
and
reorder
it
instruct
itself
so
