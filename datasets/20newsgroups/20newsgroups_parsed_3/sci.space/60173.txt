comment
on
the
absorbt
of
the
offic
of
explor
into
the
offic
of
space
scienc
and
the
reassign
of
griffin
to
the
chief
engin
posit
is
thi
just
a
meaningless
administr
shuffl
or
doe
thi
bode
ill
for
sei
in
my
opinion
thi
seem
like
a
bad
thing
at
least
on
the
surfac
griffin
seem
to
be
someon
who
wa
actual
interest
in
get
thing
done
and
who
wa
will
to
look
an
innov
approach
to
get
thing
done
faster
better
and
cheaper
it
unclear
to
me
whether
he
will
be
abl
to
do
thi
at
hi
new
posit
doe
anyon
know
what
hi
new
duti
will
be
first
ive
heard
of
it
offhand
griffin
is
no
longer
an
offic
head
so
that
bad
on
the
other
hand
regress
seem
to
think
we
cant
fund
anyth
by
griffin
becaus
that
would
mean
and
we
have
the
lie
by
the
old
hardlin
about
the
billion
mar
mission
to
prove
it
that
we
would
be
buy
into
a
mission
to
mar
that
would
cost
billion
therefor
there
will
be
no
artemi
or
million
dollar
lunar
orbit
et
cetera
they
were
kill
griffin
main
program
simpli
becaus
some
sycoph
somewher
had
congress
beleivin
that
to
do
so
would
simpli
be
to
buy
into
the
same
old
stuff
sorta
like
not
give
aid
to
yeltsin
becaus
he
a
communist
hardlin
at
least
now
the
sort
of
reform
griffin
wa
tri
to
bring
forward
wont
be
trap
in
their
own
littl
easili
contain
and
defund
ghetto

and
if

bring
someth
up
noon
can
say
whi
dont
you
go
back
to
the
ose
where
you
belong
and
where
he
couldnt
even
get
money
for
design
studi
phil
fraer
