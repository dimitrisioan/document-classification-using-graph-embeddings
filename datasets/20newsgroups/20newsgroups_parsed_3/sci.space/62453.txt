what

have

serious
though
your
never
go
to
get
a

scope
into
orbit
a

a
you
can
build
one
on
the
ground
and
with
adapt
optic
and
a
good

the
differ

is
narrow
quit
a

also

a

the

a

thousand

would
have

done
so

might
not
seem
so

a

a

is
concern
they
are
extrem
bright
exist
satellit
are
point
of
light
but
an

that
appear
a

so
i
rather
think
these
will
appear
