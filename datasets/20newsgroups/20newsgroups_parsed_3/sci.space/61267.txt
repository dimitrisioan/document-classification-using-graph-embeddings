be
expect
how

to

how
much

doe
a

put

john

i
had
to
turn
to
one
of
my
problem
set
that
i
did
in
class
for
thi
littl
problem
i
dont
have
a
calcul
but
i
do
have
the
problem
set
that
we
did
not
too
long
ago
so
ill
use
that
and
hope
it
what
you
want
thi
is
a
highli
simplifi
problem
with
a
veri
simpl
burst
burst
are
usual
more
complex
than
thi
exampl
i
will
use
here
our
burst
ha
a
peak
flux
of
e
erg
cm
sec
and
a
durat
of
second
dure
the
frst
second
of
the
burst
and
the
last
second
it
flux
is
half
of
the
peak
flux
it
flux
is
the
peak
flux
the
rest
of
the
time
assum
that
the
background
flux
is
e
erg
cm
sec
then
we
had
to
find
the
integr
luminos
of
the
burst
for
sever
differ
sphere
rpcoort
cloud
radiu
rpcat
the
edg
of
the
galaxi
rpc
or
the
edg
of
the
galact
corona
and
lastli
at
a
rmpc
we
integr
the
flux
over
all
time
to
find
the
fluenc
then
use
the
old
standbi
formula
luminositypirfpeak
for
a
radiu
of
pc
we
found
an
l
around
ergsec
pretti
energet
for
close
by
for
the
coron
model
we
found
around
ergsec
and
lastli
for
the
cosmolog
model
an
l
that
what
youd
call
moder

id
say
ani
suggest
about
what
could
put
