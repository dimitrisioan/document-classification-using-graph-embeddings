you
may
want
to
put
hubbl
back
in
the
payload
bay
for
a
reboost
and
you
dont
want
to
clip
off
the
panel
each
time
the
artist
render
that
ive
seen
of
the
hst
reboost
still
have
the
array

extend
with
a
cradl
hold
hst
at
a
degre
angl
to
the
shuttl
i
think
the
render
wa
conceiv
befor
the
array
replacemnet
wa
approv
so
im
not
sure
if
the
current
reboost
will
occur
with
the
array
deploy
or
not
howev
it
doesnt
appear
that
an
array
retract
wa
necessari
for
reboost
for
the
gammaray

one
of
