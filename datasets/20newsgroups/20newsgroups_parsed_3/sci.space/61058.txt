pontif
i
heard
onc
that
the
voyag
had
a
failsaf
routin
built
in
that
essenti
say
if
you
never
hear
from
earth
again
here
what
to
do
thi
wa
a
back
up
in
the
event
a
receiv
burnt
out
but
the
probe
could
still
send
data
limit
but
still
some
data
voyag
ha
the
unusu
luck
to
be
on
a
stabl
trajectori
out
of
the
solar
system
all
it
do
is
collect
field
data
and
routin
squirt
it
down
one
of
the
marin
is
also
in
stabl
solar
orbit
and
still
provid
similiar
solar
data
someth
in
a
planetari
orbit
is
subject
to
much
more
complex
forc
comsat
in
stabl
geosynch
orbit
requir
almost
daili
stationkeep
oper
for
the
occasion
deep
space
bird
like
pff
after
pluto
sure
it
could
be
left
on
autopilot
but
thing
like
galileo
or
magellan
id
suspect
they
need
enough
housekeep
that
even
untend
theyd
end
up
unus
after
a
while
the
better
question
should
be
whi
not
transfer
om
of
all
bird
to
a
separ
agenc
with
contin
fund
to
support
these
kind
of
ongo
scienc
mission
pat
when
ongo
op
are
mention
it
seem
to
alway
quot
oper
and
data
analysi
how
much
would
it
cost
to
collect
the
data
and
let
it
be
analyz
whenev
kinda
like
all
that
landsat
data
that
sat
around
for
year
befor
someon
analyz
it
for
the
ozon
hole
even
if
you
let
teh
bird
drift
it
may
get
hose
by
some
cosmic
phenomenon
sinc
thi
would
be
a
shutdown
that
may
never
be
refund
for
startup
if
some
type
of
cosmic
bem
took
out
the
probe
it
might
not
be
such
a
big
loss
obvious
you
cant
plan
for
everyth
but
the
most
obviou
thing
can
be
consid
jame
t
green
i
know
you
believ
you
understand
what
it
is
that
you
think
i
said
but
i
am
not
sure
that
you
realiz
that
what
i
said
is
not
what
i
meant
