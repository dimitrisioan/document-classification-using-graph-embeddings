write
thi
prize
isnt
big
enough
to
warrent
develop
a
ssto
but
it
is
enough
to
do
it
if
the
vehicl
exist
actual
there
are
peopl
who
will
tell
you
that
it
would
be
enough
to
do
ssto
develop
if
done
privat
a
a

oper
of
cours
they
may
be
overoptimist
in
spite
of
my
great
respect
for
the
peopl
you
speak
of
i
think
their
cost
estim
are
a
bit
overoptimist
if
noth
el
a
work
ssto
is
at
least
a
complex
a
a
larg
airlin
and
ha
a
smaller
experi
base
it
therefor
seem
that
ssto
develop
should
cost
at
least
a
much
a
a
typic
airlin
develop
that
put
it
in
the
g
to
g
rang
you
can
also
assum
that
a
work
ssto
would
have
other
applic
that
would
help
pay
for
it
develop
cost
true
it
and
the
contest
would
result
in
a
much
larger
market
but
i
dont
think
it
would
be
enough
to
attract
the
investor
given
the
risk
involv
if
you
could
gurante
the
ssto
cost
and
gurante
that
it
captur

then
i
think
you
could
