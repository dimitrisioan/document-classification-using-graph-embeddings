anyon
have

info
on
the
appar
sight
of
vulcan
all
that
i
know
is
that
there
were
appar
two
sight
at
drastic
differ
time
of
a
small

that
wa

mercuri
orbit
beyond

the
sight
were
appar
spuriou
there
is
no
planet
insid
of
the
orbit
of
mercuri
the
idea
of
vulcan
came
from
the
differ
between
mercuri
observ
perihelion
precess
and
the
valu
it
should
have
had

hi
inclin

to
believ
the

sort
of
thing
wa
afoot
with
mercuri

ala

not

mercuri
perihelion
precess
at

the
