question
about
the

act
a
blackbodi
and
theyr
at

well
i
wa
dead
wrong
our
local
interstellar
dust
expert
bruce
drain
ha
inform
me
that
dust
grain
arent
good
radiat
in
the
far
ir
which
is
whi
they
are
so
warm
actual
the
ambient

field
from

alan
stern
of
the
southwest
research
institut
gave
a
talk
on
the
plutocharon
binari
system
yesterday
he
gave
a
brief
overview
of
the
currentlyaccept
system
paramet
volum
ratio
of
about
mass
ratio
about
or
so
plu
lot
more
and
then
gave
hi
thought
on
the
format
of
plutocharon
hi
idea
is
that
there
were
lot
and
lot
of
small
planetesim
in
the
outer
solar
system
with
mass
distribut
a
a
power
law
of
some
kind
over
time
the
planetesim
accret
into
larger
bodi
most
got
scatter
out
of
the
solar
system
by
close
encount
with
jupit
and
saturn
but
mani
accret
into
the
ga
giant
especi
uranu
and
neptun
a
larg
planetesim
wa
captur
by
neptun
we
call
it
triton
captur
how
perhap
by
a
collis
with
a
smaller
alreadyexist
neptunian
moon
perhap
by
a
veri
close
passag
through
neptun
atmospher
mondo
aerobrak
he
note
that
the
two
recent
discov
kuiper
belt
object
qb
and
fw
plu
chiron
and
pholu
are
all
about
the
same
mass
and
he
identifi
thi
group
a
oneaccretiondown
from
the
larger
bodi
of
triton
and
plutocharon
plutocharon
he
think
form
when
an
impact
bodi
hit
protopluto
knock
some
materi
into
a
ring
around
pluto
which
later
accret
in
charon
similar
to
idea
about
the
format
of
earth
moon
there
is
good
evid
from
spectrum
that
the
surfac
of
pluto
and
charon
are
veri
differ
pluto
ha
methan
frost
charon
doesnt
which
can
be
use
a
evid
for
the
impact
theori
he
belief
that
there
may
be
around
plutotochirons
object
remain
in
a
rel
stabl
dynam
zone
just
outsid
neptun
orbit
beyond
au
or
so
qb
and
fw
are
the
first
member
of
thi
popul
to
be
found
in
hi
model
note
that
such
bodi
will
be
veri
dark
sinc
if
their
surfac
are
cover
with
methan
frost
it
will
have
photolyz
into
veri
dark
longchain
hydrocarbon
by
now
the
reason
that
pluto
ha
such
a
high
albedo
around
i
think
is
that
it
surfac
warm
up
just
enough
around
perihelion
to
sublim
and
when
the
atmospher
freez
out
again
thirti
year
later
it
form
bright
new
frost
so
ani
bodi
much
farther
away
than
au
are
go
to
be
veri
hard
to
see
i
hope
i
havent
made
ani
error
in
the
transcript
if
you

not
hi
by
the
way
he
one
of
the
top
gun
behind
the
pluto
fast
flybi
mission
i
think
and
said
that
the
current
plan
are
to
use
a
titan
to
send
the
probe
on
just
about
a
rectilinear
trajectori
to
pluto
we
were
speak
loos
at
the
time
hed
like
to
use
a
proton
which
give
a
slightli
smaller
veloc
but
cost
much
le
hi
figur
million
for
titan
launch
there
will
be
two

or

for

launch
he
told
a
stori
about
how
the
soviet
origin
offer
to
sell
proton
launch
for
million
each
but
were
forc
to
increas
their
price
in
the
u
in

to
