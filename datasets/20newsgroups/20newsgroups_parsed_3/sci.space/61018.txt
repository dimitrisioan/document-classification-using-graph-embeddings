is
thi
one
the
spinoff
we
were
promis
in

which
involv
a
disput
over
the
sale
of

to
the

for
use
a
billboard
nasa
ha
taken
the
firstep
toward
thi
hideou
vision
of
the
futur
observ
were
startl
thi
spring
when
a
nasa
launch
vehicl
arriv
at
the
pad
with
schwarzenegg
paint
in
huge
block

on
the

you
might
a

direct
some
of
thi

advert
long
befor
nasa
sign
of

a

now
space
market
is
work
with
univers
of
colorado
and
livermor
engin
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflat
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
thi
sound
like
someth
lowel

would
think
of
doe
anyon

cost
estim
wn
mar
the
taxpay
would
bear
most
of
the
expens
thi
may
look
like
environment
vandal
but
mike
lawson
ceo
of
space
market
told
u
yesterday
that
the
real
purpos
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environ
the
platform
will
carri
ozon
monitor
he
explainedadvertis
is
just
to
help
defray
cost
thi
may
be
the
purpos
for
the
univers
of
colorado
peopl
my
guess
is
that
the
purpos
for
the
livermor
peopl
is
to
learn
how
to
build
larg
inflat
space
structur
what
do
you
think
of
thi
revolt
and
hideou
attempt
to
vandal
the
night
sky
it
is
not
even
april
anymor
if
thi
is
true
i
think
it
a
great
idea
learn
how
to
build
to
build
structur
in
space
in
an
essenti
step
toward
space
develop
and
given
that
freedom
appear
to
be

question
whether
nasa

to
provid
much
if

area
especi
if
