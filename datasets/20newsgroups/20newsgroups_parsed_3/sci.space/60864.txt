supris
the

where
wrong
to
get
nasa
to
address
the
overrun
you
approv
of
what
the

did
to
cover
up
the
overrun
if
it
take
four
flight
a
year
to
resuppli
the

a
cost
of

you
state
that
your

thi
mere
point
out
a
blatent
contridict
in

know
denni
that
nasa
doesnt
includ
transport
cost
for

that
come
from
the
shuttl
budget
what
they
where
say
is
that
oper
cost
