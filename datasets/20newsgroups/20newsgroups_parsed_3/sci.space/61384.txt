where
are
they
pat
write
we
know
it
not
real
close
like
slightli
extra
solar
becaus
we
have
no
parallax
measur
on
the
burst
we
can
onli
say
that
they
are
beyond
about
au
due
to
the
low
accuraci
of
posit

by

what
i
am
wonder
is
thi
in
peopl
opinion
a
new
physic
problem
einstein
got
well
known
for
solvingth
photoelectr
effect

start
look
at

in

motion
is
thi
a
big
enough
problem
to
creat
a
new
area
of
physic
just
a
littl
specul
think
folk
it
may
be
a
new
physic
problem
ie
a
problem
involv
new
physic
howev
the
data
is
not
good
enough
to
rule
out
the
model
which
use
old
physic
new
physic
is
a
big
step
and
is
onli
toler
when
there
is
no
altern
for

the
dark

problem
there
more
to
the

than
meet
the

is
a
question
of
compar

to

we
have
much
better

no
