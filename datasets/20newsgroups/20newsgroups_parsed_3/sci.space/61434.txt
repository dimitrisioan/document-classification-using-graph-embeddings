michael
corvin
write
regard
the
feasabl
of
retriev
the
hst
for
repair
and
relaunch
it
caution
specul
mode
engag
there
is
anoth
consider
that
hasnt
been
mention
yet
i
expect
that
retriev
hst
would
involv
damag
it
consider
in
order
to
return
it
to
it
cradl
in
the
cargo
bay
most
of
the
deploy
item
antenna
and
especi
the
solar
aray
probabl
are
not
retract
into
their
fulli
stow
posit
even
by
hand
they
would
have
to
be
remov
by
the
astronaut
the
onli
advantag
that
thi
might
yield
is
that
we
could
put
new
panel
on
that
dont
ring
due
to
thermal
cycl
stress
i
also
expect
that
a
ha
been
discuss
the
land
load
on
the
hst
optic
structur
is
a
big
issu
but
that
the
reentri
load
are
much
le
so
can
the
moveabl
optic
compon
even
be
recag
i
assum
that
they
were
cage
for
launch
it
would
be
nice
if
someon
here
from
the
hst
program
wa
talk
instead
of
all
the
specul
that
is
go
on
here
from
what
i
understand
from
dr
frank
six
of
the
marshal
space
flight
center
there
is
no
insrmount
problem
in
bring
hst
back
it
wa
design
that
way
to
begin
with
also
it
is
my
understand
that
the
solar
array
will
be
one
of
the
item
replac
on
thi
mission
the
origin
were
built
by
brit
aerospac
and
i
think
the
new
one
are
too
i
am
current
work
with
the
guy
at
msfc
that
are
in
charg
is
the
hst
power
system
although
i
have
not
spoken
with
them
in
a
long
time
about
hst
