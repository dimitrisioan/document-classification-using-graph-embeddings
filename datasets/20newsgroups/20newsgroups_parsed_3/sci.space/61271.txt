gamma
ray
burster
where
are
they
write
catalog
these
test
all
show
that
the
burst
have
an
isotrop
distributionevenli
spread
out
in
a
radial
direct
and
they
show
sign
of
homogen
ie
they
do
not
clump
in
ani
one
direct
so
unless
we
are
sampl
the
area
insid
the
disk
of
the
galaxi
we
are
sampl
the
univers
not
cool
if
you
want
to
figur
out
what
the
hell
caus
these
thing
now
i
suppos
you
are
say
well
we
stil
onli
may
be
sampl
from
insid
the
disk
well
not
necessarili
rememb
we
have
what
is
more
or
le
an
interplanetari
network
of
burst
detector
with
a
baselin
that
goe
waaaay
out
to
beyond
plutopion
so
we
should
be
abl
with
all
of
our
detector
de
tect
some
sort
of
differ
in
angl
from
satellit
to
satellit
here
an
analog
you
see
a
plane
overhead
you
measur
the
angl
of
the
plane
from
the
origin
of
your
arbitrari
coordin
system
one
of
your
friend
a
mile
away
see
the
same
plane
and
measur
the
angl
from
the
zero
point
of
hi
arbitrari
system
which
is
the
same
a
your
the
two
angl
are
differ
and
you
should
be
abl
to
triangul
the
posit
of
your
burst
and
mayb
find
a
sourc
to
my
knowledg
no
one
ha
been
abl
to
do
thi
uh
no
these
burst
detector
are
just
that
burst
detector
they
have
no
angular
resolut
now
a
network
of
burst
detector
could
have
angular
resolut
but
we
do
not
have
a
decent
set
of
differ
network
at
the
distanc
neccesari
from
each
other
to
determin
if
theyr
happen
in
the
oort
cloud
or
not
we
have
one
network
and
tri
to
make
two
network
out
of
it
degrad
what
angular
resolut
we
have
phil
fraer
seem
like
everi

we
find
