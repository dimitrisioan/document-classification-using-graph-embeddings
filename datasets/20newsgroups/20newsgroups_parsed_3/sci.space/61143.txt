meet

by

vlbi
project
team
recent
conclud
a
weeklong
seri
of
meet
with
offici
from
russia
and
japan
the
meet
were
part
of
space
vlbi
week
held
at
jpl
in
earli
march
and
were
intend
to
maintain
cooper
between
intern
space
agenc
particip
in
the
develop
of
the
u
space
vlbi
project
a
recent
approv
jpl
flight
project
set
for
launch
in
u
space
vlbi
will
util
two
earthorbit
spacecraft
the
japanes
vsop
vlbi
space
observ
program
satellit
with
it
meter
radio
telescop
and
a
russian
radioastron
meter
satellit
both
spacecraft
will
team
up
with
groundbas
radio
telescop
locat
around
the
world
to
creat
a
radio
telescop
network
that
astronom
hope
will
expand
radio
telescop
observ
power
by
a
factor
of
japan
vsop
satellit
will
use
a
limit
sixhour
orbit
to
conduct
imag
scienc
while
the
russian
radioastron
spacecraft
will
exploit
a
larger
hour
earth
orbit
to
conduct
exploratori
radio
astronomi
each
satellit
will
point
at
a
sourc
target
for
roughli
hour
while
approxim
groundbas
radio
telescop
will
simultan
point
at
the
same
sourc
object
while
within
view
on
earth
accord
to
dr
joel
smith
jpl
project
manag
for
the
u
space
vlbi
meet
like
those
held
at
jpl
will
permit
japan
and
russia
who
have
littl
previou
experi
in
radio
interferometri
to
establish
work
relationship
with
the
radio
astronomi
commun
that
will
be
vital
dure
the
complex
observ
requir
by
the
space
vlbi
project
one
of
our
main
activ
is
develop
the
methodolog
for
intern
coordin
becaus
the
two
spacecraft
simultan
reli
on
the
correspond
track
station
while
use
the
groundbas
radio
telescop
to
observ
the
same
celesti
object
said
smith
three
new
track
antenna
are
be
built
at
dsn
facil
and
other
three
other
track
facil
locat
in
japan
russia
and
green
bank
wva
thi
global
network
of
groundbas
radio
telescop
will
use
precis
clock
and
highspe
record
to
collect
observ
data
and
forward
the
inform
to
a
correl
locat
at
the
nation
radio
astronomi
observatori
in
socorro
nm
the
correl
will
combin
and
process
data
then
make
it
avail
to
mission
investig
in
moscow
tokyo
and
jpl
via
electron
mail
smith
is
optimist
that
the
massiv
radio
telescop
creat
by
the
space
vlbi
network
will
provid
radio
astronom
with
better
resolut
than
ha
ever
been
achiev
befor
by
groundbas
radio
telescop
allow
astronom
to
take
a
closer
look
at
distant
object
in
space
there
is
a
long
histori
of
radio
astronomi
use
groundbas
telescop
said
smith
what
we
intend
to
do
is
to
extend
radio
astronomi
into
earth
orbit
our
goal
is
to
look
deeper
into
the
core
of
galact
nucleu
quasar
and
other
activ
radio
sourc
to
understand
what
drive
those
thing
we
have
seen
so
far
with
radio
astronomi
smith
note
that
if
one
examin
the
activ
galact
nucleu
youll
find
jet
appear
to
spew
at
speed
greater
than
light
and
at
energi
level
that
are
million
of
time
greater
than
you
would
expect
he
said
some
astronom
believ
that
black
hole
may
be
locat
in
the
core
of
these
galaxi
and
that
they
may
fuel
the
jet
smith
hope
that
by
use
space
vlbi
to
look
further
into
the
core
thi
theori
may
be
support
or
disprov
russian
spaceflight
hardwar
includ
transpond
and
transmitt
are
now
be
test
in
the
unit
state
and
japanes
hardwar
is
schedul
to
arriv
for
test
later
thi
year
analysi
of
thi
hardwar
will
permit
u
scientist
and
engin
to
understand
how
to
modifi
the
highspe
vlba
correl
oper
at
the
nrao
in
order
to
accommod
the
odd
data
pattern
that
will
origin
from
the
more
than
groundbas
radio
telescop
involv
in
space
vlbi
smith
is
particularli
pleas
that
meet
with
the
japanes
and
russian
space
agenc
offici
like
those
held
at
jpl
in
march
have
proceed
smoothli
yet
he
know
that
the
polit
uncertainti
in
russia
could
jeopard
that
countri
particip
in
the
project
noth
is
ever
smooth
he
said
but
the
russian
have
been
incred
open
with
u
we
alway
anticip
some
likelihood
that
we
will
not
succeed
becaus
of
polit
factor
beyond
our
control
yet
there
tend
to
be
a
way
of
keep
these
thing
go
becaus
scientist
on
both
side
are
tri
hard
and
peopl
recogn
the
valu
of
cooper
at
thi
level
smith
point
out
that
the
japanes
space
agenc
ha
more
at
stake
than
just
fulfil
an
intern
commit
to
a
scienc
mission
the
japanes
have
been
extrem
cooper
sinc
intern
cooper
is
essenti
to
their
scienc
mission
he
said
but
smith
also
note
that
japanes
space
agenc
offici
look
at
the
u
space
vlbi
mission
a
an
opportun
to
showcas
the
technolog
involv
with
vsop
spacecraft
and
their
highli
regard
mach
v
launch
vehicl
yet
regardless
of
the
risk
involv
in
undertak
such
an
ambiti
project
jpl
smith
is
satisfi
that
plan
for
the
space
vlbi
project
is
beyond
the
signific
financi
and
polit
hurdl
that
otherwis
might
threaten
the
project
fortun
we
have
the
virtu
of
have
two
partner
and
if
either
fall
out
we
would
still
have
someth
