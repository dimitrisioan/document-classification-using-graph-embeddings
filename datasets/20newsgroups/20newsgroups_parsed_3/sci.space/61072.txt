the
centaur
is
control
technolog
state
dept
will
not
allow
it
to
be
use
outsid
of
u
sorri
in
articl
jame
thoma
green
write
ha
anyon
look
into
the
possibl
of
a
protoncentaur
combo
what
would
be
the
benefit
and
problem
with
such
a
combo
other
than
the
obviou
instabl
in
the
xssr
now
i
havent
seen
ani
specul
about
it
but
the
salyut
kb
design
bureau
wa
plan
a
new
lhlox
second
stage
for
the
proton
which
would
boost
payload
to
leo
from
about
to
kg
geostationari
go
from
kg
gal
launcher
version
to
kg
thi
scheme
wa
compet
with
the
energiam
last
year
and
i
havent
heard
which
won
except
now
i
recent
read
that
the
central
special
kb
wa
work
on
the
successor
to
the
soyuz
booster
which
must
be
the
energiam
so
the
earli
result
are
energiam
won
but
thi
is
a
guess
noth
is
veri
clear
in
russia
im
sure
if
salyut
kb
get
fund
from
someon
they
will
continu
their
develop
the
centaur
for
the
alta
is
about
meter
dia
and
the
proton
is
so
that
a
good
fit
for
their
exist
upper
stage
the
blockd
which
set
insid
a
shround
just
under
meter
dia
i
dont
know
about
launch
load
etc
but
sinc
the
centaur
surviv
titan
launch
which
are
probabl
wors
than
the
proton
those
titan
srb
probabl
shake
thing
up
pretti
good
it
seem
feasibl
except
the
centaur
is
a
veri
fragil
thing
and
may
requir
integr
on
the
pad
which
is
not
avail
now
proton
are
assembl
and
transport
horizonti
doe
anyon
know
how
much
stress
in
the
way
of
a
payload
a
centaur
could
support
while
bolt
to
a
proton
horizont
and
then
taken
down
the
rail
road
track
and
erect
on
the
pad
they
would
also
need
lox
and
lh
facil
ad
to
the
proton
pad
unless
the
new
proton
second
stage
is
actual
built
and
of
cours
ani
centaur
support
system
and
facil
no
doubt
import
from
the
u
at
great
cost
these
system
may
viloat
u
law
so
there
are
polit
problem
to
solv
in
addit
to
the
instabl
in
