would
be
wonderful
in
articl
jim
hart
write
if
anybodi
ha
a
strong
claim
to
control
of
the
the
night
sky
it
is
astronom
check
out
the
common
law
in
the
day
when
wild
land
werent
scarc
pioneer
laid
claim
to
the
land
by
put
it
to
use
eg
clear
and
grow
a
crop
even
trespass
can
lay
claim
to
the
right
of
passag
if
if
theyv
done
it
for
long
enough
and
the
owner
have
not
complain
or
taken
step
to
stop
them
usag
beget
properti
right
astronom
have
been
use
the
night
sky
for
thousand
of
year
they
own
it
eg
light
pollut
they
will
lose
their
commonlaw
right
of
ownership
anoth
consequ
of
their
ownership
is
that
they
are
free
to
sell
it
now
astronom
need
money
for
their
work
if
light
pollut
billboard
and
mirror
go
up
they
will
need
even
more
money
to
buy
extra
imag
process
equip
filter
space
telescop
etc
to
get
around
the
problem
so
a
long
a
we
can
defin
who
astronom
are
eg
do
they
includ
amateur
astronom
natur
lover
we
can
set
up
a
system
of
voluntari
consensu
to
solv
thi
disput
instead
invok
ban
regul
etc
enforc
by
bribe
politician
at
the
point
of
a
gun
whi
do
folk
alway
think
of
that
sordid
solut
we
ought
to
pa
a
law
to
solv
problem
first
instead
of
a
a
last
resort
when
other
method
have
fail
stuff
delet
thi
propos
certainli
need
work
but
how
about
work
on
these
kind
of
idea
first
befor
write
there
ought
to
be
a
law
letter
to
our
congresscritt
let
give
noncoerc
consensu
via
the
free
market
a
chanc
to
solv
thi
problem
jim
hart
would
mr
hart
pleas
explain
how
one
could
get
everi
nation
on
earth
and
everi
corpor
to
agre
that
astronom
own
the
night
sky
without
coercion
rememb
that
not
everi
nation
follow
the
english
common
law
in
most
countri
for
most
of
histori
it
wa
probabl
true
that
the
ruler
own
everyth
not
explicitli
own
by
individu
even
in
north
america
where
by
the
principl
enunci
the
aborigin
inhabit
should
have
own
everyth
when
new
arriv
want
to
use
land
and
resourc
they
just
took
it
over
in
case
mr
hart
hasnt
notic
there
is
current
a
brutal
war
go
on
in
bosnia
about
who
own
what
of
cours
if
some
friendli
super
power
were
to
give
an
intern
astronomi
organ
some
antisatelit
missil
and
also
agre
to
defend
it
if
attack
such
a
propos
might
work
but
it
would
hardli
be
noncoerc
some
of
u
nutti
environmentalist
think
it
might
make
sens
first
to
tri
to
mobil
public
opinion
against
advertis
in
space
and
also
to
use
government
action
like
tax
power
for

to

thi
of

would
be
