i
ought
not

when
ive
a

some
odd
post
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
econom
sinc
someon
with
space
industri
will
presum
have
a
much
larger

than
they
would
without

industri
eventu
they
will
simpli
be
abl
to

more

if
i
read
you
right
your
say
in

that
with
a
larger

will
have
more

conceiv
that

it
possibl
that

it
most
like
that

at

therefor
lunar

should
