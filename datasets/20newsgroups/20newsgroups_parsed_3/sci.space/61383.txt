fro
the
discus
of
long
term
mission
into
space
and
there
affect
on
human
and
such
adam
whi
bother
with
a
new
newsgroup
if
you
want
to
discus
the
subject
start
discus
it
if
there
is
enough
traffic
to
annoy
the
rest
of
u
we
will
let
you
know
and
then
it
will
be
time
for
a
new
newsgroup
well
here
goe
the
first
item
of
busi
is
to
establish
the
import
space
life
scienc
in
the
whole
of
scheme
of
humankind
i
mean
compar
to
footbal
and
basebal
the
averag
joe
schmoe
doesnt
seem
interest
or
even
curiou
about
spaceflight
i
think
that
thi
forum
can
make
a
major
chang
in
that
lack
of
insight
and
educ
all
of
u
in
our
own
way
can
contribut
to
a
comprehens
document
which
can
be
releas
to
the
gener
public
around
the
world
the
document
would
scientif
analyz
the
technic
aspect
of
long
term
human
habit
in
space
i
believ
that
if
ani
longterm
space
explor
program
is
to
succeed
we
need
to
basic
learn
how
to
engin
our
own
microworld
ie
the
spacecraft
onli
through
the
care
analys
of
engin
chemic
biolog
and
medic
factor
will
a
good
ecosystem
be
creat
to
facilit
human
life
on
a
longdur
flight
so
i
would
like
to
see
post
of
opinion
regard
the
most
object
method
to
analyz
the
accept
scientif
literatur
for
technolog
which
can
be
appli
to
longdur
spaceflight
such
a
detail
literatur
search
would
be
of
interest
to
ourselv
a
space
advoc
and
clearli
import
to
exist
space
program
in
essenc
we
would
be
divid
the
space
life
scienc
issu
into
variou
technic
problem
which
could
be
solv
with
variou
technolog
thi
databas
of
accept
solut
to
variou
problem
could
form
the
basi
of
detail
discus
involv
peopl
