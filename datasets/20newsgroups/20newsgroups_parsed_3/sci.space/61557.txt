if

then
ill
be
interest
after
you

i
somehow
think
they
could
train
up
a
new
eva
in
month
first
while
astronaut
certainli
have
done
eva
with
minim
plan
that
wa
becaus
they
had
to
they
dont
like
to
do
that
a
a
gener
rule
so
how
long
do
they
need
to
train
a
year
year
somehow
i
think
moth
should
be
adequ
second
rememb
whi
they
had
to
improvis
dure
intelsat
they
were
tri
to
attach
a
motor
to
a
piec
of
hardwar
that
wasnt
design
to
do
that
tri
to
shortcut
the
train
is
onli
go
to
make
a
repeat
more
like
also
becaus
they
significantli
lack
onorbit
eva
experi
the
hst
is
design
for
onorbit
servic
it
should
be
a
lot
easier
third
they
dont
have
eight
month
they
have
howev
much
time
is
left
after
someon
come
up
with
a
plan
show
it
can
work
and
get
it
approv
you
may
think
i
have
a
pessimist
attitud
i
think
it
realist
im
not
say
that
the
engin
task
is
imposs
few
engin
task
are
what
im
say
is
that
thi
is
neither
cost
effect
nor
feasibl
under
nasa
manag
there
come
a
time
in
everi
project
to
kill
the
manag
they
can
if
neccessari
reschedul
the
hst
mission
decemb
is
not
a
drop
dead
date
unlik
say
the
ldef
retriev
mission
all
they
have
to
do
is
soup
it
up
just
what
doe
that
mean
i
suspect
the
bu
may
not
have
enough
basic
thrust
for
the
hst
reboost
it
mayu
need
bigger
tank
or
bigger
thruster
my
understand
is
the
second
hst
servic
mission
is
not
a
conting
my
understand
is
the
mission
need
both
a
new
foc
and
work
on
the
electr
system
plu
anoth
reboost
if
the
smt
can
avoid
a
second
servic
mission
that
million
save
no
pat
that
million
minu
the
cost
of
the
new
hardwar
minu
the
cost
of
the
extra
struff
you
want
to
bring
along
minu
develop
and
mangement
cost
minu
extra
oper
cost
tanstaafl
somehow
i
think
the
cost
of
an
expend
smt
will
be
le
then
million
and
the
extra
stuff
is
real
cheap
nasa
ha
lot
of
suit
mmu
and
the
edo
pallet
are
reusabl
oh
one
doubl
magnum
of
champagn
now
there
a
coupl
hundr
buck
pat
not
onli
is
thi
messi
and
le
reliabl
than
a
devic
that
made
to
perform
thi
task
it
also
ignor
the
point
there
is
a
desir
to
have
astronaut
avail
so
that
if
the
door
fail
to
open
someth
can
be
done
about
it
unless
you
can
provid
a
veri
reliabl
way
of
reopen
the
door
you
havent
solv
the
problem
that
door
ha
cycl
x
time
alreadi
onc
after
massiv
g
load
i
somehow
think
they
can
work
oureli
method
to
ensur
the
door
work
also
plea
tell
me
how
some
sort
of
sublim
materi
like
co
or
ho
would
manag
to
contamin
the
mirror
anyth
that
goe
to
vapor
state
shouldnt
adher
to
the
mirror
somehow
the
door
problem
can
be
work
mayb
they
can
put
a
one
time
spring
on
it
what
do
they
do
now
if
the
door
hang
up
that
door
is
part
of
a
intrument
safe
mechan

itll
be
month
until
someon
get
up
