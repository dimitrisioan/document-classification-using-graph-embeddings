write
ha
anyon
look
into
the
possibl
of
a
protoncentaur
combo
what
would
be
the
benefit
and
problem
with
such
a
combo
other
than
the
obviou
instabl
in
the
xssr
now
the
centaur
for
the
alta
is
about
meter
dia
and
the
proton
is
so
that
a
good
fit
for
their
exist
upper
stage
the
blockd
which
set
insid
a
shround
just
under
meter
dia
i
dont
know
about
launch
load
etc
but
sinc
the
centaur
surviv
titan
launch
which
are
probabl
wors
than
the
proton
those
titan
srb
probabl
shake
thing
up
pretti
good
it
seem
feasibl
except
the
centaur
is
a
veri
fragil
thing
and
may
requir
integr
on
the
pad
which
is
not
avail
now
proton
are
assembl
and
transport
horizonti
doe
anyon
know
how
much
stress
in
the
way
of
a
payload
a
centaur
could
support
while
bolt
to
a
proton
horizont
and
then
taken
down
the
rail
road
track
and
erect
on
the
pad
the
centaur
that
is
be
built
for
t
would
be
a
better
bet
to
integr
onto
the
proton
a
the
tcentaur
is
design
for
the
extrem
harsh
envorin
of
the
t
launch
it
is
also
closer
to
m
in
diamet
youv
hit
on
the
real
kicker
howev
the
centaur
is
pressur
stabil
it
can
not
hold
up
it
own
weight
without
pressur
in
the
tank
addit
the
pressur
differ
between
the
two
tank
must
be
maintain
to
psi
that
is
rather
tight
to
be
rock
and
roll
on
the
train
the
pressur
stabil
is
how
centaur
achiev
the
perform
on
numer
occas
when
i
wa
there
the
af
want
to
see
what
it
would
take
to
make
a
nonpressur
stabil
centaur
the
answer
a
centaur
not
worth
launch
the
atlascentaur
doe
not
requir
onpad
integr
howev
the
tcentaur
doe
i
believ
the
onpad
integr
is
to
a
great
extent
due
to
the
cleanli
requir
and
pfl
configur
so
mayb
someth
can
be
done
there
they
would
also
need
lox
and
lh
facil
ad
to
the
proton
pad
unless
the
new
proton
second
stage
is
actual
built
and
of
cours
ani
centaur
support
system
and
facil
no
doubt
import
from
the
u
at
great
cost
these
system
may
viloat
u
law
so
there
are
polit
problem
to
solv
in
addit
to
the
instabl
in
the
ci
you
mention
the
addit
of
loxlh
facil
is
critic
a
the
centaur
top
off
a
it
lift
off
a
lhe
facil
is
also
need
i
dont
know
what
the
proton
us
for
fuel
but
sinc
they
are
deriv
from
icbm
i
would
suspect
that
they
use
storabl
propel
which
dont
have
the
ullag
problem
that
cryo
do
if
there
is
no
cryo
at
the
sight
at
all
the
addit
of
these
system
could
be
big
not
to
mention
the
real
tech
transfer
issu
involv
with
provid
centaur
gse
to
russia
that
issu
alon
might
be
enough
to
kill
