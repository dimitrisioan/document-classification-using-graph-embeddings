constel
ssf
is
up
for
redesign
again
let
do
it
right
thi
time
let
step
back
and
consid
the
function
we
want
microgravityvacuum
process

adapt
to

spacecraft
mainten
the
old
nasa
approach
explifi
by
shuttl
and
ssf
so
far
wa
to
central
function
these
project
fail
to
meet
their
target
by
a
wide
margin
the
militari
and
commerci
user
took
most
of
their
payload
off
shuttl
after
wast
much
effort
to
tie
their
payload
to
it
and
ssf
ha
crumbl
into
disorgan
and
miscommun
over
billion
ha
been
spent
on
these
two
project
with
no
reduct
in
launch
cost
and
littel
improv
in

industri
meanwhil
militari
and
commerci
user
have
come
up
with
a
superior
strategi
for
space
develop
the
constel
firstli
differ
function
are
broken
down
into
differ
constel
place
in
the
optim
orbit
for
each
function
thu
we
have
the
gpsnavstar
constel
in
hour
orbit
comsat
in
clark
and
molniya
orbit
etc
secondli
the
task
is
distribut
amongst
sever
spacecraft
in
a
constel
provid
for
redund
and
full
coverag
where
need
ssf
main
function
requir
quit
differ
environ
and
are
also
prime
candid
for
constel
we
have
the
make
of
a
micrograv
constel
now
comet
and
mir
for
longdur
flight
shuttlespacelab
for
shortdur
flight
the
best
strategi
for
thi
area
is
inexpens
increment
improv
instal

u
facil
on
mir
shuttlemir
linkup
and
transit
from
shuttlespacelab
to
a
much
le
expens
sstospacehabcomet
or
sstosifcomet
we
might
also
expand
the
research
program
to
take
advantag
of
interest
space
environ
eg
the
highradi
van
allen
belt
or
gasplasma
gradient
in
comet
tail
the
comet
system
can
be
much
more
easili
retrofit
for
these
task
where
a
station
is
too
larg
to
afford
launch
beyond
leo
we
need
to
studi
life
scienc
not
just
in
micrograv
but
also
in
lunar
and
martian
graviti
and
in
the
radiat
environ
of
deep
space
instead
of
the
protect
shelter
of

thi
is
a

by

the

i
