i
strongli
suspect
that

had
the

that
much
more
wa
at
stake
than
could
it
work
with

who

financi

the

use
of
a

area
are
obviou
spaceflight
is
not
in
thi
posit
the
correct
analog
is
not
with
aviat
of
the
s
but
the
long
transocean
voyag
of
the
age
of
discoveri
lindbergh
flight
took
place
in
not
the
thirti
of
cours
sorri
for
the
misunderstand
i
wa
refer
to
the
fact
that
far
more
aeronaut
develop
took
place
in
the
s
for
much
of
the
s
the
superabund
of
jenni
and
ox
engin
held
down
the
industri
by
mani
of
the
obsolet
wwi
aircraft
had
been
retir
and
whirlwind
had
their
powerweight
ratio
and
reliabl
up
to
the
point
where
longdist
flight
becam
practic
it
import
to
note
that
the
atlant
wa
flown
not
onc
but
three
time
in
lindbergh
chamberlin
and
levin
and
byrd
america
when
it
time
to
railroad
you
railroad
it
didnt
requir
govt
to
fund
these
a
long
a
someth
wa
known
about
the
potenti
for
profit
at
the
destin
in
practic
some
were
govt
fund
some
were
privat
could
you
give
exampl
of
privat
fund
one
not
off
the
top
of
my
head
ill
have
to
dig
out
my
refer
book
again
howev
i
will
say
that
the
most
common
arrang
in
princ
henri
the
navig
portug
wa
for
the
princ
to
put
up
part
of
the
money
and
merchant
to
put
up
the
rest
they
profit
from
the
voyag
would
then
be
share
but
there
wa
no
way
that
ani
wise
investor
would
spend
a
larg
amount
of
money
on
a
veri
riski
invest
with
no
idea
of
the
possibl
payoff
a
person
who
put
up
x
billion
for
a
moon
base
is
much
more
like
to
do
it
becaus
they
want
to
see
it
done
than
becaus
they
expect
to
make
money
off
the
deal
the
problem
is
that
the
amount
of
prize
money
requir
to
inspir
a
moon
base
is
much
larger
than
ani
but
a
hand
of
individu
or
corpor
can
even
consid
put
up
the
kremer
prize
human
power
aircraft
orteig
prize
lord
northcliff
prize
for
cross
the
atlant
won
in
by
alcock
and
brown
were
much
smaller
the
technolog
requir
were
within
the
reach
of
individu
inventor
and
the
prize
amount
were
well
within
the
reach
of
a
larg
number
of
wealthi
individu
i
think
that
onli
a
govt
could
afford
to
set
up
a
b
prize
for
