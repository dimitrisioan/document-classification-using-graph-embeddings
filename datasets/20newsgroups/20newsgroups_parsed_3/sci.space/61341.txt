how
you
fit

when
the

comet

which
are

cosmolog
mechin
is
the
catalyt
convers
of
a
neutron
star
to
a
strang
star
or
the
merger
of
two
strang

but
that
use
pretti
farout
physic
my
point
is
that
we
dont
have
a
good
mechan
at
ani
distanc
so
grb
are
like
to
be
happen
by
an
unknown
mechan
so
we
cant
rule
out
the
oort
cloud
what
would
be
the
spectrum
of
an
event
which
convert
a
comet
to
strang
matter
the
spectrum
for
primordi
black
hole
eat
comet
and
antimatt
comet
collid
with

comet
arent
quit
right
but
perhap
there
is
an
unusu
mechan
which
modifi
the

the
energi
match
veri
well
for
both
of
these
mechan
accord
to
trevor
week
if
the
tunguska
meteorit
wa
a
miniblack
hole
collis
with
the
earth
then
there
are
like
to
be
enough
miniblack
hole
around
that
the
rate
for
bhcomet
collis
match
the
grb
rate
well
the
fact
that
we
dont
know
the
distribut
of
comet
in
the
oort
cloud
isnt
a
reason
to
rule
them
out
it
make
it
harder
to
rule
them
out
the
point
of
the
cite
paper
wa
that
if
we
assum
they
got
the
right
distribut
for
the
oort
cloud
it
is
hard
but
not
imposs
to
match
that
up
with
the
distribut
of
grb
if
they
got
the
wrong
distribut
for
the
oort
cloud
they
cant
constrain

grb
at

dont
