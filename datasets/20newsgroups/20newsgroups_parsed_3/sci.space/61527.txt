it
may
feel
strang
at
first
but
the
bodi
doe

the
feel
is
not
too
differ
from
that
of
sky
dive
im
no
astronaut
but
ive
flown
in
the
kc
sever
time
ill
tell
you
about
my
first
flight
at
the
onset
of
weightless
my
shoulder
lift
and
my
spine
straighten
i
felt
a
momentari
panic
and
my
hand
tri
to
grab
onto
someth
like
the
strap
keep
me
firmli
against
the
floor
to
prevent
me
from
fall
i
rememb
concious
overrul
my
involuntari
motion
my
ear
felt
not
heard
a
rush
and
i
could
feel
fluid
move
in
my
head
like
when
you
get
up
from
bed
while
you
have
a
cold
at
that
point
i
ceas
to
concentr
on
my
physiolog
respons
sinc
i
had
some
scienc
to
do
i
wa
busi
keep
my
experi
go
and
keep
track
of
all
the
part
dure
the
return
of
graviti
and
subsequ
g
pullout
so
i
didnt
realli
pay
attent
to
physiolog
at
that
time
after
about
parabola
i
discov
that
i
wa
perform
one
of
the
trick
ive
discov
to
keep
myself
from
get
motion
sick
i
wa
keep
my
head
veri
still
and
move
veri
slowli
all
except
my
hand
and
arm
which
need
to
be
in
rapid
conciou
motion
for
my
experi
dure
the
pullout
to
parabola
my
queasi
final
start
to
get
to
me
and
i
had
to
use
one
of
those
airsick
bag
i
wa
basic
useless
for
the
rest
of
that
flight
so
i
went
to
the
seat
in
the
back
of
the
plane
while
my
partner
whom
i
draft
for
just
thi
purpos
kept
work
on
the
experi
while
i
wa
ill
he
wa
a
vetran
vomit
comet
rider
one
of
those
anomal
peopl
who
dont
get
sick
on
the
thing
i
didnt
think
of
it
a
a
constant
sensat
of
fall
so
much
a
like
swim
in
air
it
veri
close
to
the
sensat
i
feel
when
im
scuba
dive
and
i
turn
my
head
down
and
fin
up
jerri
and
what
is
the
motion
sick
that
some
astronaut
occasion
experi
ron
it
is
the
bodi
reaction
to
a
strang
environ
it
appear
to
be
induc
partli
to
physic
discomfort
and
part
to
mental
distress
some
peopl
are
more
prone
to
it
than
other
like
some
peopl
are
more
prone
to
get
sick
on
a
roller
coaster
ride
than
other
the
mental
part
is
usual
induc
by
a
lack
of
clear
indic
of
which
way
is
up
or
down
ie
the
shuttl
is
normal
orient
with
it
cargo
bay
point
toward
earth
so
the
earth
or
ground
is
abov

head
of
