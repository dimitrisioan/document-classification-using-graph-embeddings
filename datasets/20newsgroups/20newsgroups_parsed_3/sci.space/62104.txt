deliv

most
import

most
revolutionari
space
vehicl
ha
one
can
not
argu
with
the
fact
that
it
fli
land
and
is
reusabl
watch
me
it
fli
it
land
it
get
rebuilt
in
my
opinion
these
were
the
onli
appropri
specif
for
thi
program
that
not
what
they
told
u
back
in
the
s
it
ha
been
a
test
program
from
the
start
a
logic
follow
to
the
x
program
and
the
later
xseri
lift
bodi
it
isnt
a
logic
followon
a
logic
followon
would
have
been
either
a
russian
snowfox
type
thingey
for
the
lift
bodi
or
someth
like
mmi

van
or
boe
tsto
or
the

tsto
the
militari
is
allegedli
use
now
that
probabl
cost
le
to
develop
than
the
shuttl
doe
to
fli
for
a
year
the
engin
spec
that
the
guy
in
the
trench
had
were
to
develop
a
system
which
wa
manrat
could
land
reliabl
and
could
be
reflown
these
goal
were
quit
visionari
for
the
s
and
i
would
argu
that
they
are
challeng
even
today
includ
for
the
dcx
program
keep
that
attitud
and
itll
be
a
coupl
centuri
befor
we
get
real
access
to
space
unless
anoth
countri
without
all
that
baggag
come
along
and
kick
our
as
in
the
space
race
i
do
not
recal
a
flightweek
specif
in
the
final
nasa
spec
for
the
space
shuttl
program
if
you
have
such
document
i
would
find
them
most
reveal
and
interest
a
far
a
i
can
tell
the
onli
peopl
tout
a
flight
per
week
flight
rate
were
peopl
on
capitol
hill
or
sell
book
to
the
gener
public
or
nasa
hq
that
doesnt
give
the
rest
of
the
program
plausibl
deniabl
if
we
deceid
that
it
wasnt
worth
the
money
weve
spent
which
is
by
now
probabl
a
lot
more
than
apollo
imho
polit
statement
in
the
hall
of
the
u
congress
are
not
admiss
a
engin
spec
becaus
spec
should
be
determin
by
nasadod
and
contractor
not
by
congressman
senat
or
presid
mission
are
defin
by
polit
leader
but
not
the
engin
spec
ye
but
it
get
sold
on
the
basi
of
the
polit
statement
your
say
basic
that
it
met
the
engin
spec
which
is
question
imho
so
it
a
success
never
mind
that
you
couldnt
get
the
fund
the
shuttl
eat
with
those
engin
spec
in
a
thousand
year
the
shuttl
is
the
onli
reusabl
space
vehicl
thi
automat
qualifi
it
a
an
unparallel
engin
success
you
could
argu
about
it
polit
success
but
engin
wise
it
is
clearli
the
most
advanc
machin
ever
flown
i
argu
that
engin
and
technic
data
for
hyperson
flight
is
valuabl
in
and
of
itself
shuttl
should
be
justifi
or
critic
on
the
basi
of
econom
you
can
get
hyperson
flight
data
with
an
x
or
a
followon
x
type
vehicl
for
much
le
and
econom
and
engin
are
interchang
engin
in
the
absens
of
econom
is
basic
just
physic
and
in
term
of
physic
the
shuttl
look
like
a
failur
next
to
the
x
then
henri
wrote
hssorri
support
that
i
can
arrang
for
launcher
all
go
to
launcher
hsthat
i
have
some
hope
of
ride
some
day
at
the
moment
that
hsdcx
hopedfor
successor
i
wa
disappoint
by
thi
and
other
similar
statement
from
those
vocal
in
support
of
the
dcx
program
your
support
of
dcx
is
base
on
hope
my
support
for
the
shuttl
program
is
base
on
record
the
shuttl
program
ha
a
bad
record
i
onc
had
hope
for
the
shuttl
program
by
now
i
know
those
hope
were
fals
all
i
have
for
dcx
and
similar
and
dissimilar
experiment
vehicl
are
hope
but
at
least
i
know
they
arent
fals
hope
yet
i
did
support
the
shuttl
way
back
when
it
didnt
do
nearli
what
it
wa
suppos
to
it
time
to
move
on
to
someth
that
might
do
the
job
of
orbit
deliveri
better
or
at
all
i
think
that
it
is
also
import
to
note
that
i
do
not
object
to
dcx
it
is
visionari
i
origin
post
i
like
the
dcx
idea
and
i
am
realli
hope
that
itll
be
a
stun
success
unfortun
dcxer
are
not
will
to
return
that
support
the
proven
shuttl
program
explain
whi
you
folk
critic
shuttl
when
shuttl
is
exactli
what
you
guy
need
in
order
to
learn
how
to
oper
dcx
onorbit
we
dont
want
to
learn
how
to
oper
on
orbit
it
launch
it
shove
out
the
payload
it
land
it
doesnt
wast
payload
haul
up
and
down
edo
pallet
and
the
like
the
onli
thing
to
be
learn
from
shuttl
is
how
not
to
build
a
launcher
final
that
bit
about
the
proven
shuttl
are
you
hope
you
can
tell
a
lie
enough
time
and
get
someon
to
believ
it
i
enjoy
your
later
post
regard
the
comparison
between
the
shuttl
and
the
soyuz
project
although
i
may
disagre
with
your
method
of
analysi
you
probabl
will
disagre
with
mine
i
think
that
the
total
impact
of
the
shuttl
program
must
be
judg
on
the
scientif
and
technic
merit
not
on
timelin
and
schedul
do
you
agre
how
much
scienc
and
technolog
could
have
been
done
is
the
money
spent
on
shuttl
had
been
spent
differ
a
for
now
we
need
to
stop
think
of
dcx
and
shuttl
a
mutual
exclus
learn
about
econom
and
the
current
budget
realiti
in
the
