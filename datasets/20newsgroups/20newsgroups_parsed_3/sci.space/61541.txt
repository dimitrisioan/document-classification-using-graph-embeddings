put

i
know
energi
depend

which
is

an

we
found
around

lastli
for

model
an
l
that
what
youd
call
moder
energet
id
say
ani
suggest
about
what
could
put
out
that
much
energi
in
one
second
jeremi
supernova
put
out
or
i
forget
which
but
it
onli
an
order
of
magnitud
not
in
gamma
ray
though
youd
hafta
get
all
of
that
into
gamma
if
they
were
at
mpc
but
if
a
decent
fraction
of
the
sn
output
wa
in
gamma
it
could
reason
be
extragalact
but
closer
than
mpc
i
dunno
sn
theori
so
well
but
i
cant
think
of
how
to
get
mani
gamma
out
mayb
i
should
look
it
up
big
radio
galaxi
can
put
out
erg
continu
that
just
in
the
radio
there
are
a
lot
of
gamma
around
them
too
but
burst
nah
neither
of
these
should
be
taken
a
explan
just
tri
to
show
that
those
energi
are
produc

we
