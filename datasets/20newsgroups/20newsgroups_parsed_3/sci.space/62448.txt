write
phil
your
point
is
well
taken
it
is
still
a
sad
idea
im
worri
by
the
concern
about
it
though
for
a
number
of
reason
that
have
noth
to
do
with
space
advertis
which
for
a
number
of
reason
is
probabl
doom
to
fail
on
financi
ground
and
ive
been
read
and
and
write
thi
thread
sinc
way
back
when
it
wa
onli
on
scispac
for
starter
i
dont
think
the
piec
of
lightpollut
apparatu
would
be
a
bright
a
the
full
moon
that
seem
to
me
to
be
a
bit
of
propaganda
on
the
part
of
oppon
or
wish
think
on
the
part
of
propon
second
thi
charg
of
ruin
the

perman
ha
been

that
either
dont

you
may

i
think
it
wa
josh
hopkin
who
actual
did
the

after
all
end
some
two
month
of
frenzi
opposit
on
the
part
of
darkski
activist
and
variou
other
type
is
mainli
project
like
the
orbit
mirror
the
ci
test
recent
while
slightli
more
worrisom
id
like
to
point
out
that
ani
signific
scatter
of
light
outsid
the
target
area
for
one
of
these
mirror
would
be
wast
a
far
a
the
project
would
be
concern
and
someth
ani
project
like
that
would
work
against
anyway
and
given
some
of
the
like
target
i
dont
think
there
go
to
be
much
of
an
outcri
from
the
inhabit
there
is
too
much
dark
sky
in
the
northern
ci
dure
the

i
doubt
youll
find
