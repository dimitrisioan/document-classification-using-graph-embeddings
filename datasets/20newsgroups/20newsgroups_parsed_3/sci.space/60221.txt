ill
believ
that
thi
is
realli
go
to
work
on
the
typic
trash
one
need
to
process
when
i
see
them
put
a
coupl
ton
in
one
end
and
get
rel
clean
materi
out
the
other
end
plu
be
abl
to
run
it
off
it
own
residu
power
sound
almost
like
perpetu
motion
doesnt
it
i
will
believ
that
thi
process
come
even
close
to
approach
technolog
and
econom
feasibl
given
the
mix
natur
of
the
trash
that
will
have
to
be
run
through
it
a
oppos
to
the
cost
of
separ
thing
first
and
have
a
differ
run
for
each
actinid
when
i
see
them
dump
a
few
ton
in
one
end
and
pull
rel
clean
materi
out
the
other
onc
the
cost
technolog
risk
etc
are
taken
into
account
i
still
class
thi
one
with
the
idea
of
throw
wast
into
the
sun
sure
it
possibl
and
the
physic
are
well
understood
but
is
it
realli
a
reason
approach
how
is
it
ever
go
to
be
an
off
the
shelf
technolog
if
someon
doesnt
do
it
mayb
we
should
do
thi
a
part
of
the
ssf
design
goal
gee
fred
after
your
bitter
defens
of

power
a
a
basic
technolog
for
ssf
id
think
you
would
support
a
minor
research
program
like
thi
and
doe
anyon
who
know
more
particl
physic
then
me
know
if
the
ipn
could
prove
thi
technolog
the
real
reason
whi
acceler
breeder
or
inciner
are
not
be
built
is
that
there
isnt
ani
reason
to
do
so
natur
uranium
is
still
too
cheap
and
geolog
dispos
of
actinid
look
technic
reason
it
may
also
help
there
is
polit
gridlock
on
the
entir
nuclear
technic
agenda
there
were
big
polit
opponen
to

wipp
is
be
fought
to

in

even
if
you
could
make
