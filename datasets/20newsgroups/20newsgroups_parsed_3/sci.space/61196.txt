from
in
articl
pat
write
what
evid
indic
that
gamma
ray
burster
are
veri
far
away
given
the
enorm
power
i
wa
just
wonder
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
hole
or
someth
like
that
fairli
close
by
whi
would
they
have
to
be
at
galact
rang
my
own
pet
theori
is
that
it
fli
saucer
enter
hyperspac
but
the
reason
i
am
ask
is
that
most
everyon
assum
that
they
are
collid
nuetron
star
or
spin
black
hole
i
just
wonder
if
ani
mechan
could
exist
and
place
them
closer
in
pat
well
let
seei
took
a
class
on
thi
last
fall
and
i
have
no
note
so
ill
tri
to
wing
it
here
how
i
understand
it
rememb
from
stellar
evolut
that
black
hole
and
neutron
starspulsar
are
form
from
high
mass
star
mstarmsun
high
mass
star
live
fast
and
burn
hard
take
appoxim
year
befor
go
nova
or
supernova
in
thi
time
they
dont
live
long
enough
to
get
perturb
out
of
the
galact
plane
so
ani
of
these
if
assum
to
be
the
sourc
of
grb
will
be
in
the
plane
of
the
galaxi
then
we
take
the
catalog
of
burst
that
have
been
reciev
from
the
variou
satellit
around
the
solar
system
pioneer
venu
ha
one
either
pion
or
ginga
and
of
cours
bat
and
we
do
distribut
test
on
our
catalog
these
test
all
show
that
the
burst
have
an
isotrop
distributionevenli
spread
out
in
a
radial
direct
and
they
show
sign
of
homogen
ie
they
do
not
clump
in
ani
one
direct
so
unless
we
are
sampl
the
area
insid
the
disk
of
the
galaxi
we
are
sampl
the
univers
not
cool
if
you
want
to
figur
out
what
the
hell
caus
these
thing
now
i
suppos
you
are
say
well
we
stil
onli
may
be
sampl
from
insid
the
disk
well
not
necessarili
rememb
we
have
what
is
more
or
le
an
interplanetari
network
of
burst
detector
with
a
baselin
that
goe
waaaay
out
to
beyond
plutopion
so
we
should
be
abl
with
all
of
our
detector
de
tect
some
sort
of
differ
in
angl
from
satellit
to
satellit
here
an
analog
you
see
a
plane
overhead
you
measur
the
angl
of
the
plane
from
the
origin
of
your
arbitrari
coordin
system
one
of
your
friend
a
mile
away
see
the
same
plane
and
measur
the
angl
from
the
zero
point
of
hi
arbitrari
system
which
is
the
same
a
your
the
two
angl
are
differ
and
you
should
be
abl
to
triangul
the
posit
of
your
burst
and
mayb
find
a
sourc
to
my
knowledg
no
one
ha
been
abl
to
do
thi
i
should
throw
in
whi
halo
and
corona
model
dont
work
also
a
i
said
befor
look
at
the
possibl
astrophys
of
the
burst
short
timescal
high
energi
black
hole
and
pulsar
exhibit
much
of
thi
type
of
behavior
if
thi
is
the
case
a
i
said
befor
these
star
seem
to
be
bound
to
the
disk
of
the
galaxi
especi
the
most
energet
of
the
these
sourc
when
you
look
at
a
simul
model
where
the
burst
are
confin
to
the
disk
but
you
sampl
out
to
larg
distanc
say
mpc
you
should
definit
see
not
onli
an
anisotropi
toward
you
in
all
direct
but
a
clump
of
sourc
in
the
direct
of
the
galact
center
a
i
said
befor
there
is
none
of
these
characterist
i
think
that
all
of
itif
someon
need
clarif
or
know
someth
that
i
dont
know
by
all
mean
correct
me
i
had
the
honor
of
take
the
burst
class
with
the
person
who
ha
done
the
model
of
these
differ
distribut
so
we
pretti
much
kick
around
everi
possibl
distribut
there
wa
and
some
veri
outrag
sourc
collid
pulsar
black
hole
pulsar
that
are
slow
downstuff
like
that
it
a
fun
field
complaint
and
correct
