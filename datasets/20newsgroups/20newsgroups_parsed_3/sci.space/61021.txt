accord
to
an
altern
ephemeri
and
photometr
observ
are
import
for
refin
iapetu
orbit
becaus
the

size
project
on
the

a
seen
from

it
unlik
that
we
will
learn
anyth

for
more
detail
thank
to
andi
odel
of
northern
arizona
univers
for
bring
the
event
to
my
attent
thermal
observ
jay
goguen
write
to
me
the
interest
thing
to
do
would
be
thermal
ir
of
the
juli
disappear
into
the
shadow
of
the
planet
to
measur
thermal
inertia
etc
unfortun
the
ut
of
thi
event
render
it
inaccess
except
from
russia
even
from
calar
alto
saturn
is
rise
through
airmass
at
ut
do
you
know
anyon
in
russia
or
ukrain
with
a
big
telescop
and
um
instrument
that
look
for
someth
to
do
id
be
will
to
make
a
person
grant
of
for
the
data
jay
and
again
pleas
tri
to
encourag
anyon
that
can
observ
the
iapetu
planet
disappear
to
do
so
at
thermal
wavelength
my
impress
would
be
that
it
not
an
easi
observ
iapetu
will
be
faint
and
get
fainter
in
eclips
so
youll
need
a
big
telescop
that
a
good
ir
telescop
and
reason
um
instrument
i
dont
think
that
combin
is
wide
avail
at
the
longitud
that
are
well
place
for
observ
we
need
sofia
for
thi
one
one
possibl
would
be
the
ir
telescop
in
india
but
