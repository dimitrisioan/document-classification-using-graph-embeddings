nick
method
and
judgment
about

mean
t
mayb
id
get
it
if
you
said
what
the
complaint
are
about
rather
than
do
the
same
thing
that
you
mean
to
complain
about
when
you
trash
peopl
how
am
i
suppos
to
read
that
a
trash
peopl
is
bad
f
gee
funni
that
you
get
it
now
then
deliber
obtus
perhap
fred
issu

alleg
trash
of
other
i
onli
got
it
when
you
stop
trash
and
made
your
point
patent
instead
of
allegor
that
wa
my
point
all
along
fred
not
onli
do
you
do
the
same
thing
on
the
net
honestli
report
your
idea
on
matter
of
polici
and
project
in
space
but
your
respons
wa
just
bait
not
even
part
of
a
debat
i
have
yet
to
see
nick
enter
into
anyth
remot
resembl
a
debat
i
see
him
flame
anyon
or
anyth
who
disagre
with
the
one
true
szabo
plan
i
see
him
attack
peopl
call
them
lazi
bastard
becaus
they
had
the
temer
to
disagre
with
the
almight
nick
i
see
him
question
peopl
ethic
again
becaus
they
had
the
temer
to
disagre
with
lord
god
szabo
but
debat
bwaaaaahhhaaaa
im
glad
you
can
laugh
sinc
your
ratio
of
debateinsult
is
about
the
same
not
even
close
tommi
and
gener
onli
when
im
deal
with
someon
like
nick
i
see
we
are
deal
with
a
problem
in
a
conflict
of
interpret
not
least
of
which
is
your
belief
that
onli
you
can
adequ
judg
what
is
and
is
not
debat
suffic
to
say
that
i
disagre
with
you
on
that
last
point
whi
dont
you
take
a
poll
fred
if
you
want
some
psuedoobject
pointofview
and
a
usual
you
defend
your
insult
with
he
start
it
yeah
i
took
some
of
hi
research
and
call
it
my
own
but
he
start
it
so
what
if
i
stole
hi
car
he
stole
my
lawnmow
first
besid
that
i
think
it
still
open
to
interpret
whether
nick
actual
did
start
it
so
your
defens
besid
be
lame
and
contradict
the
first
part
of
the
sentenc
in
which
it
occur
may
not
even
appli
anyway
your
defens
remind
me
of
the
guy
that
broke
the
borrow
tool
i
never
borrow
it
i
alreadi
gave
it
back
and
it
wa
broken
when
you
gave
it
to
me
make
up
yer
mind
fred
im
not
convinc
that
peopl
are
necessari
in
all
part
of
everi
space
base
process
and
your
respons
doesnt
tell
me
a
thing
about
the
reason
whi
you
think
they
should
be
except
to
impun
the
motiv
of
the
person
with
a
diverg
opinion
who
said
i
think
they
should
be
tommi
show
me
a
note
where
i
said
that
and
ill
eat
thi
termin
see
below
fred
fred
i
coclud
that
you
did
sinc
you
took
issu
with
it
the
fact
that
my
conclus
wa
incorrect
ie
that
you
were
take
issu
with
someth
differ
is
evid
that
your
commun
style
is
confus
or
evid
that
your
read
and
comprehens
style
are
inadequ
first
i
tri
to
address
what
i
think
you
meant
for
which
i
am
reward
with
a
denial
of
sort
and
a
smart
remark
then
i
point
out
that
i
am
not
clear
what
you
did
mean
rather
than
risk

second
time
and
im
stupid

great
point
here
somewher
it
just
that
between
stupid
peopl
that
you

your
jealou
guard
of
your
valuabl
opinion

get
around
to
make
it
plea
quot
the
it
i
took

believ
you
will
see
if
you
look
that
what
i
wa
and

take
issu
with
is
mr

forgiv
me
for
give
your

more
mean
than
they
ever
should

had
my
read
of
what
nick
actual
said
is
that
peopl
