some
of
the

are
binari
compat

eg
you
can
just
copi
your
program
from

a

it
would
run
a
oppos

buy
the

graphic
objectori
design
it
all
wsiwig
postscript
support
parallel
hetrogen
process
and
best
of
all
it
is
base
around
the
mach
microkernel
so
you
can
make
it
look
like
unix
with
x
or

or
nt
or
even

if
you
feel
the
need
no
