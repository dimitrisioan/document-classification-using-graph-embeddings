just
exactli
how
much
gold
mylar

need
to
put
the
golden
arch
of
a
certain
american
fast

organ
on
the
face
of
the

fortun
we
sober
up
in

hmmm
it
actual
isnt
all
that

is
it
like
about
million
km
if
you
think
that
sound
like
a
lot
it
onli
a
few
ten
of
m
per

that
said
organ
sold
last

youd
be
best
off
with
a

substanc
that
could
be
spray
thinli
by
an
unman
craft
in
lunar
orbit
or
rather
a
larg
set
of
such
craft
if
you
can
get
a
reason
albedo
it
would
be
visibl
even
at
new

sinc
the
moon
itself
is
quit
dark
