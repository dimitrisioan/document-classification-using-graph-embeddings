tri
to
land
a
shuttl
with
that
big
huge
telescop
in
the
back
and
you
could
have
problem
the
shuttl
just
isnt
design
to
land
with
that
much
weight
in
the
payload
is
hst
realli
that
much
heavier
than
a
spacelab
i
hate
to
belabor
the
obviou
onc
again
but
if
there
had
been
an
orbit
emerg
in
the
earli
stage
of
the
origin
hst
deploy
mission
they
would
have
had
to
land
with
hst
in
the
bay
inde
they
were
worri
about
that
one
concern
wa
the
possibl
that
they
would
lose
a
motor
or
someth
on
the
way
up
and
make
orbit
but
one
that
wa
too
low
to
give
hst
a
use
lifetim
against
atmospher
drag
i
believ
the
decis
wa
to
deploy
hst
even
if
the
project
lifetim
wa
a
short
a
six
month
in
fact
we
got
an
excel
orbit
on
the
upper
envelop
of
what
the
shuttl
can
do
i
have
never
heard
of
ani
seriou
consider
that
hst
might
be
brought
down
for
refurbish
you
would
have
the
horrend
cost
of
transport
clean
retest
and
recertifi
all
the
hardwar
on
the
ground
in
addit
to
the
lost
observ
time
and
the
cost
of
a
second
deploy
mission
with
the
risk
that
we
might
not
get
such
a
good
orbit
the
second
time
and
you
would
probabl
still
need
a
third
servic
mission
in
a
few
year
a
gyro
and
other
compon
wear
out
better
to
have
two
servic
mission
in
space
which
could
well
happen
than
to
bring
hst
down
and
take
it
up
again
