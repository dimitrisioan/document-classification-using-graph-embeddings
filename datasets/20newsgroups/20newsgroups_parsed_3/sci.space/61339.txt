write
what
evid
indic
that
gamma
ray
burster
are
veri
far
away
given
the
enorm
power
i
wa
just
wonder
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
hole
or
someth
like
that
fairli
close
by
whi
would
they
have
to
be
at
galact
rang
david
give
good
explain
of
the
deduct
from
the
isotrop
edg
distribut
to
whit
they
are
either
part
of
the
univers
or
part
of
the
oort
cloud
whi
couldnt
they
be
earth
centr
with
the
edg
occur
at
the
edg
of
the
gravispher
i
know
there
isnt
ani
mechan
for
them
but
there
isnt
a
mechan
for
the
other
either
what
on
earth
is
the
gravispher
anyway
befor
it
decay
the
pioneer
venu
orbit
had
a
gamma
ray
detector
a
doe
ulyss
they
detect
the
brightest
burst
that
the
earth
orbit
detector
do
so
the
burst
are
at
least
at
oort
cloud
distanc
in
principl
four
detector
space
out
by
a
few
au
would
see
parallax
if
the
burst
are
of
solar
system
origin
the
problem
with
oort
cloud
sourc
is
that
absolut
no
plausibl
mechan
ha
been
propos
it
would
have
to
involv
new
physic
a
far
a
i
can
tell
closest
to
convent
oort
sourc
is
a
model
of
bfield
pinch
by
comet
it
got
too
mani
hole
in
it
to
count
but
at
least
it
wa
a
good

standard
disclaim
the
law
of
graviti
are
veryveri
strict
and
your
just
bend
them
for
your
own
benefit
bb
alsoif
they
did
come
from
the
oort
cloud
we
would
expect
to
see
the
same
from
other
star
oort
cloud
