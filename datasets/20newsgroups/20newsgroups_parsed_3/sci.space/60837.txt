there
is
no
such
thing
a
a
stabl
lunar
orbit
is
it
right
that
is
new
stuff
for
me
so
it
mean
that
you
just
can
not
put
a
sattellit
around
around
the
moon
for
too
long
becaus
it
orbit
will
be
unstabl
if
so
what
is
the
reason
is
that
becaus
the
combin
gravitacion
atract
of
the
sunmoon
and
earth
that
doe
not
provid
a
stabl
orbit
around
the
moon
ani
lunar
satellit
need
fuel
to
do
regular
orbit
correct
and
when
it
fuel
run
out
it
will
crash
within
month
the
orbit
of
the
apollo
mothership
chang
notic
dure
lunar
mission
last
onli
a
few
day
it
is
possibl
that
there
are
stabl
orbit
here
and
there
the
moon
gravit
field
is
poorli
map
but
we
know
of
none
perturb
from
sun
and
earth
are
rel
minor
issu
at
low
altitud
the
big
problem
is
that
the
moon
own
gravit
field
is
quit
lumpi
due
to
the
irregular
distribut
of
mass
within
the
moon
all
