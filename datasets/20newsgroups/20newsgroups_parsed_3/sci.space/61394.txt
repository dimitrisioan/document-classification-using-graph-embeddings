actual
my
advisor
anoth
classmat
of
mine
and
me
were
talk
the
other
day
about
put
just
one
detector
on
one
of
the
pluto
satellit
then
we
realiz
that
the
satellit
alon
is
onli
carri
someth
like
pound
of
eq
well
a
bat
detector
need
lead
shield
to
protect
it
and
alon
weigh
about
pound
itself
actual
the
situat
is
even
wors
than
that
the
total
mass
of
the
pluto
fast
flybi
spacecraft
is
onli
ish
pound
and
most
of
that
is
support
equip
like
power
and
commun
the
mass
avail
for
instrument
is
mayb
of
that
i
dont
think
a
bat
will
fit
from
the
pluto

in

the

will
come
from

and
the
whole

craft
will
be
about
foot

with
no
