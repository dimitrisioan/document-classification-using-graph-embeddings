if

it

be
a

i
agre
that
the

most
peopl
today
onli
care

i
think
to
some
extent
thi
is
a
case
of
stoop

their
level
you
assum
that
the

cant
handl
the

and
then
base
on
thi
assumpt
go
for
the
fluff
argument
then
someon
who
can
understand
a
good
argument
come
along
and
ask
whi
dont
you
just
develop
the
spinoff
or
whi
cant
we
just
get
our
spinoff
from
some
other
program
like
the
militari
there
are
some
good
argument
for
space
develop
without

on

im
not
ignor
the

i
simpli
think
that
the

deserv
more
credit
than
you
give

btw
dont
forget
velcro

if
your

you
better
make
