mr

post
is
right
on
the
money
if
a
littl
lengthi
in
short
an
orbit
billboard
would
be
trash
in
the
same
way
that
a
billboard
on
the
earth
is
trash
billboard
make
a
place
look
trashi
that
is
whi
there
are
law
in
mani
place
prohibit
their
use
the
light
pollut
complaint
are
mainli
an
attempt
to
find
some
tangibl
reason
to
be
against
orbit
billboard
becaus
peopl
dont
feel
moral
justifi
to
complain
on
the
ground
that
these
thing
would
defil
the
beauti
of
the
sky
i
dont
buy
it
if
the
thing
had
no
valu
at
all
peopl
wouldnt
spend
money
to
make
them
so
their
lack
of
valu
is
just
your
opinion
not
an
actual
fact
which
is
neither
a
philisoph
or
legal
basi
for
prohibit
them
on
the
other
hand
i
live
in

il
for
a
while
where
zone
law
prohibit
billboard
a
you
mention
abov
i
think
it
wa
a
fine
law
despit
it
contradictori
basi
i
would
guess
that
the
best
legal
and
moral
basi
for
protest
would
be
violat
of

i
bought
thi

out
in

specif
to
enjoy
my
hobbi
amateur
astronomi
now
thi
billboard
ha
made
that
invest
worthless
so
i
want
the
price
of
the

in
