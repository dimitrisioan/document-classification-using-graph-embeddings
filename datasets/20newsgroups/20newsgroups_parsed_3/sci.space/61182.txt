are
they
pat
write
what
evid
indic
that
gamma
ray
burster
are
veri
far
away
given
the
enorm
power
i
wa
just
wonder
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
hole
or
someth
like
that
fairli
close
by
whi
would
they
have
to
be
at
galact
rang
gamma
ray
burst
grb
are
seen
come
equal
from
all
direct
howev
given
the
number
of
bright
one
there
are
too
few
faint
one
to
be
consist
with
be
equal
dens
for
a
far
a
we
can
seeit
is
a
if
they
are
all
contain
within
a
finit
sphere
or
a
sphere
with
fuzzi
edg
with
u
at
the
center
these
measur
are
statist
and
you
can
alway
hide
a
suffici
small
number
of
a
differ
type
of
grb
with
a
differ
origin
in
the
data
i
am
assum
that
there
is
onli
one
popul
of
grb
the
data
indic
that
we
are
le
than
of
the
radiu
of
the
center
of
the
distribut
the
onli
thing
the
earth
is
at
the
exact
center
of
are
the
solar
system
at
the
scale
of
the
oort
cloud
of
comet
way
beyond
pluto
and
the
univers
cosmolog
theori
place
grb
throughout
the
univers
requir
supernovatyp
energi
to
be
releas
over
a
timescal
of
millisecond
oort
cloud
model
tend
to
be
silli
even
by
the
standard
of
astrophys
if
grb
were
galact
ie
distribut
through
the
milki
way
galaxi
you
would
expect
them
to
be
either
concentr
in
the
plane
of
the
galaxi
for
a
disk
popul
or
toward
the
galact
center
for
a
spheric
halo
popul
we
dont
see
thi
so
if
they
are
galact
they
must
be
in
a
halo
at
least
light
year
in
radiu
and
we
would
probabl
start
to
see
grb
from
the
andromeda
galaxi
assum
that
it
ha
a
similar
halo
for
comparison
the
earth
is
lightyear
from
the
center
of
the
galaxi
my
own
pet
theori
is
that
it
fli
saucer
enter
hyperspac
the
arent
concentr
in
the
known
spacelan
and
we
dont
see
mani
come
from
zeta
reticuli
and
tau
ceti
but
the
reason
i
am
ask
is
that
most
everyon
assum
that
they
are
collid
nuetron
star
or
spin
black
hole
i
just
wonder
if
ani
mechan
could
exist
and
place
them
closer
in
there
are
more
than
grb
differ
model
in
the
refere
literatur
right
now
the
theorist
have
a
sort
of
unoffici
moratorium
on
new
model
until
new
observ
evid
come
