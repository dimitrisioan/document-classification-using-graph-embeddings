thi
prize
isnt
big
enough
to
warrent
develop
a
ssto
but
it
is
enough
to
do
it
if
the
vehicl
exist
actual
there
are
peopl
who
will
tell
you
that
it
would
be
enough
to
do
ssto
develop
if
done
privat
a
a
cutrat
oper
of
cours
they
may
be
overoptimist
in
spite
of
my
great
respect
for
the
peopl
you
speak
of
i
think
their
cost
estim
are
a
bit
overoptimist
if
noth
els
a
work
ssto
is
at
least
a
complex
a
a
larg
airlin
and
ha
a
smaller
experi
base
it
therefor
seem
that
ssto
develop
should
cost
at
least
a
much
a
a
typic
airlin
develop
that
put
it
in
the
g
to
g
rang
for
the
purpos
of
a
contest
id
bet
some
thing
could
be
cut
like
fuel
for
reentri
ani
kind
of
heat
shield
etc
etc
even
still
if
the
contest
particip
had
to
fund
dc
develop
it
probabl
wouldnt
be
worth
it
to
develop
dc
just
for
the
contest
just
give
me
the
cheapest
heaviest
lift
man
rate
or
at
least
under
or
so
g
booster
if
i
dont
have
to
pay
for
dc
develop
great
ill
use
it
but
back
to
the
contest
goal
there
wa
a
recent
articl
in
awst
about
a
low
cost
it
all
rel
man
return
to
the
moon
a
gener
dynam
scheme
involv
a
titan
iv
shuttl
to
lift
a
centaur
upper
stage
lev
and
crew
capsul
the
mission
consist
of
deliv
two
unman
payload
to
the
lunar
surfac
follow
by
a
man
mission
total
cost
u
wa
billion
joint
esanasa
project
wa
billion
for
the
u
share
i
didnt
find
a
mention
of
how
long
the
crew
could
stay
but
id
bet
that
it
around
day
and
the
total
payload
deliv
wa
about
metric
tonn
so
if
you
ignor
the
scientif
payload
hitch
a
ride
in
the
crew
habit
modul
no
return
trip
and
toss
in
a
few
more
tonn
for
the
addit
consum
to
last
anoth
month
then
you
might
be
abl
to
get
a
year
visit
out
of
tonn
and
in
case
it
not
obviou
that
a
wild
as
guess
a
pretti
bore
visit
sinc
everi
trip
outdoor
eat
up
a
bit
of
lox
and
im
not
certain
if
a
home
brew
or
collegebrew
life
support
system
could
last
a
year
but
let
round
thi
up
to
tonn
convient
sinc
the
gd
plan
talk
about
ton
payload
deliv
to
the
lunar
surfac
thi
add
up
to
two
centaur
two
lev
two
shuttl
flight
all
to
put
a
singl
man
on
the
moon
for
a
year
hmmm
not
realli
practic
anyon
got
a
cheaperbett
way
of
deliv
tonn
to
the
lunar
surfac
within
the
decad
anyon
have
a
more
precis
guess
about
how
much
a
year
suppli
of
consum
and
equip
would
weigh
and
i
wa
wonder
about
the
gd
lev
is
it
reusabl
or
is
it
discard
to
burn
up
on
return
to
leo
if
it
not
discard
could
it
be
refuel
henri
do
you
know
anyth
about
the
gd
lev
i
note
that
it
us
rl
engin
arent
they
reusablerestart
would
a
lev
fit
in
a
dc
ive
forgotten
if
i
ever
knew
what
the
cargo
bay
dimens
are
for
the
dc
all
in
all
im
not
certain
that
the
singl
goalpriz
of
stay
on
the
moon
for
a
year
is
wise
andor
use
how
about
a
prize
for
the
first
nongovern
sponser
unman
moon
land
then
anoth
for
a
man
moon
land
then
yet
anoth
for
a
system
to
extract
consum
from
lunar
soil
anoth
for
a
reusabl
earthmoon
shuttl
and
so
forth
find
some
way
to
build
civilian
moonbas
infrastructur
have
a
singl
goal
might
result
in
a
bunch
of
contest
give
up
after
one
person
appear
to
win
and
for
those
that
didnt
give
up
i
find
someth
a
