team
just
look
at
the
dcx
now
call
the
dcx
btw
and
gave
an
estim
on
how
much
it
would
cost
the
air
forc
to
build
it
it
cost
sdio
m
to
build
and
it
would
cost
the
usaf
million
or
four
and
a
half
time
a
much
id
be
will
to
bet
that
a
major
of
the
cost
differ
could
be
account
for
by
the
af
requir
for

doubt
that
the
actual

would
be
veri
differ
from
sdio

thi
is
my
cynic
