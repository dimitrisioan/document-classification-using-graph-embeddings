satellit
around
pluto
mission
in
write
be
wierd
again
so
be
warn
is
there
a
plan
to
put
a
satellit
around
each
planet
in
the
solar
system
to
keep
watch
i
help
it
better
to
ask
question
befor
i
spout
an
opinion
how
about
a
mission
unman
to
pluto
to
stay
in
orbit
and
record
thing
around
and
near
and
on
pluto
i
know
it
is
a
strang
idea
but
whi
not
it
could
do
some
scan
of
not
onli
pluto
but
also
of
the
solar
system
object
near
and
aaroundpluto
a
well
a
seti
and
look
at
the
galaxi
without
have
much
of
the
solar
system
to
worri
about
do
thi
in
anyth
like
reason
time
would
requir
more
propuls
capabl
than
we
can
manag
you
would
have
to
boost
to
pluto
and
then
slow
back
down
you
could
do
someth
like
a
hohman
orbit
but
i
think
that
would
take
ridicul
amount
of
time
my
rubber
bibl
is
at
home
insist
on
perfect
safeti
is
for
peopl
who
dont
have
the
ball
to
live
in
the
real
world
