the
major
compon
of
ani
realist
plan
to
go
to
the
moon
cheapli
for
more
than
a
brief
visit
at
least
is
lowcost
transport
to
earth
orbit
for
what
it
cost
to
launch
one
shuttl
or
two
titan
iv
you
can
develop
a
new
launch
system
that
will
be
consider
cheaper
delta
clipper
might
be
a
bit
more
expens
than
thi
perhap
but
there
are
le
ambiti
way
of
bring
cost
down
quit
a
bit
ah
there
the
rub
and
a
catch
to
boot
for
the
purpos
of
a
contest
youll
probabl
not
compet
ifn
you
cant
afford
the
ride
to
get
there
and
although
lower
price
deliveri
system
might
be
doabl
without
demand
it
doubt
that
anyon
will
develop
a
new
system
cours
if
a
low
price
system
exist
there
might
be
demand
i
wonder
if
there
might
be
some
way
of
structur
a
contest
to
encourag
low
cost
payload
deliveri
system
the
account
method
would
probabl
be
the
hardest
to
work
out
for
exampl
would
you
allow
rockwel
to
loan
you
the
engin
and
so
forth

plan
for
do

use
exist
launch
system
is
wast
money
in
a
big
way
thi
depend
on
the
how
soon
the
new
launch
system
come
on
line
in
other
word
perhap
a
great
deal
of
worthwhil
technolog
life
support
navig
etc
could
be
develop
prior
to
a
low
cost
launch
system
you
wouldnt
want
to
use
the
expens
stuff
forev
but
id
hate
to
see
folk
wait
to
do
anyth
until
a
low
cost
mac
oop
i
mean
launch
system
come
on
line
i
guess
id
simplifi
thi
to
say
that
wast
is
a
slipperi
concept
if
your
goal
is
man
lunar
explor
in
the
next
year
then
perhap
it
not
wast
money
if
your
goal
is
to
explor
the
moon
for
under
million
then
you
should
put
of
thi
explor
for
a
decad
or
so
craig
