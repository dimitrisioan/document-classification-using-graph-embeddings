re
mothership
for
flybi
and
cut
cost
in
write
get
wierd
again
okay
what
about
launch
one
probe
with
multipl
part
kind
of
liek
the
old
mirv
principl
of
old
cold
war
day
basic
what
i
mean
is
design
a
mother
ship
that
ha
piggi
back
probe
for
differ
missionsnam
differ
planet
each
probe
would
be
tie
in
with
the
mother
ship
or
earth
a
the
case
may
be
thi
is
good
when
and
if
we
go
for
mar
the
mar
mission
can
act
a
either
mother
ship
or
relay
point
for
the
probe
i
cant
see
the
need
for
a
singl
big
expens
heavi
mothership
except
for
voyag
style
flybi
mission
a
few
year
ago
i
did
some
calcul
on
a
grand
tour
space
probe
launch
by
a
saturn
v
in
at
the
timei
felt
that
the
idea
of
a
big
mother
ship
had
some
merit
the
voyag
had
to
be
rather
small
lightweight
craft
due
to
the
limit
impos
by
use
weak
titan
iiicentaur
launcher
the
concept
i
examin
and
michael
had
a
lot
in
common
with
the
british
interplanetari
societi
daedalu
project
for
send
a
probe
to
barnard
star
ie
a
larg
bu
spacecraft
carri
sever
smaller
probe
to
be
dispatch
when
the
ship
arriv
at
it
destin
the
saturn
v
supposedli
would
have
been
abl
to
launch
a
ton
payload
toward
jupit
and
beyond
the
bu
could
have
includ
far
more
power
camerastelescopesscientif
equip
and
a
heaviermor
power
power
sourc
than
the
voyag
a
there
would
be
no
limit
on
weight
anymor
extrem
import
a
the
voyag
had
to
perform
most
of
their
measur
within
a
coupl
of
week
befor
and
after
planetari
encount
and
usual
at
a
rel
great
distanc
the
smaller
probe
carri
aboard
might
have
been
base
on
the
real
voyag
and
an
even
smaller
version
like
the
one
schedul
for
launch
toward
pluto
in
the
earli
st
centuri
and
would
have
been
releas
at
variou
point
dure
the
mission
the
advantag
are
obviou
the
bu
would
have
carri
out
the
same
basic
jupitersaturnuranusneptun
mission
than
voyag
did
but
in
addit
two
subprob
could
have
been
relas
at
saturn
examin
that
planet
south
polar
region
befor
move
on
to
pluto
thi
would
have
enabl
nasa
to
map
both
hemispher
of
plutocharon
by
and
sever
other
probe
could
have
examin
part
of
the
jupitersaturnuranusneptun
system
that
werent
examin
in
great
detail
by
the
voyag
due
to
trajectoryrel
factor
a
small
swarm
of
cameraequip
miniatur
space
probe
releas
a
month
befor
encount
would
have
been
too
costli
for
a
small
voyagertyp
mission
but
entir
feasibl
if
launch
from
a
heavi
wellequip
spacecraft
and
would
we
have
learn
a
lot
more
about
the
outer
planet
the
reason
whi
the
grand
tour
wa
cancel
