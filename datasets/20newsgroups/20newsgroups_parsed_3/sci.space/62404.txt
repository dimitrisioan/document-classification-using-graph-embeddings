pleas
state
your
criterion
for
select
the
greatest
philosoph
titl
p
ever

nietzsch
greatest
most
like
to
be
rememb
five
hundr
year
henc
i
must
admit
that
that
make
mani
of
my
person
favorit
not
that
great
i
make
no
comment
on
nietzch
except
to
remark
that
he
wa
no
immanuel
kant
interpret
that
cryptic
remark
a
you
pleas
some
peopl
have
append
that
remark
that
nietzch
wa
no
kant
with
thank
i
havent
read
enough
of
either
to
comment
although
everyon
tell
me
i
should
read
nietzch
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
greatest
philosoph
titl
would
have
to
go
to
plato
sinc
the
whole
enterpris
of
philosophi
wa
essenti
defin
by
him
although
he
got
most
of
hi
answer
wrong
he
did
definit
identifi
what
the
import
question
are
i
think
it
wa
descart
who
said
that
all
philosophi
is
just
a
footnot
to
plato
if
i
were
to
choos
which
philosoph
made
the
most
import
advanc
in
human
knowledg
over
hi
lifetim
that
simpleit
is
aristotl
thi
is
so
much
the
case
that
mani
simpli
refer
to
him
a
the
philosoph
regard
nietzsch
he
one
of
the
most
entertain
although
sinc
hi
idea
were
so
fragment
and
sinc
hi
life
wa
cut
short
it
is
doubt
that
hi
influenc
a
a
philosoph
is
like
to
be
veri
extens
year
from
now
theyll
probabl
still
be
read
him
in
year
though
a
for
modern
philosoph
i
would
have
to
say
that
kant
wa
the
most
influenti
sinc
he
had
such
a
strong
influenc
on
almost
everyon
who
came
after
him
and
unfortun
they
maintain
hi
error
and
amplifi
them
over
time
i
would
say
that
the
most
influenti
american
philosoph
would
have
to
be
dewey
but
a
to
the
question
of
what
philosoph
will
be
most
highli
regard
in
year
it
may
veri
well
be
ayn
rand
who
in
everi
import
respect
wa
american
but
wa
born
in
russia
but
i
guess
that
remain
to
be
seen
