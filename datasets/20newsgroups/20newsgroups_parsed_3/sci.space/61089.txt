in
articl
pat
write
the
question
i
have
about
the
proton
is
could
it
be
handl
at
one
of
ksc
spare
pad
without
major
malfunct
or
could
it
be
handl
at
kourou
or
vandenberg
seem
like
a
lot
of
troubl
to
go
to
it
probabl
better
to
invest
in
newer
launch
system
i
dont
think
a
big
cost
advantag
for
use
russian
system
will
last
for
veri
long
mayb
a
few
year
lockhe
would
be
the
place
to
ask
sinc
you
would
probabl
have
to
buy
the
proton
from
them
they
market
the
proton
world
wide
except
russia
they
should
know
a
lot
about
the
possibl
i
havent
heard
them
propos
u
launch
so
i
assum
they
look
into
it
and
found
it
unprofit
now
if
it
use
storabl
ye
then
how
long
would
it
take
for
the
russian

equip
someth
at
cape
york
compar
to
the
zenit
i
suppos
but
sinc
it
look
like
noth
will
be
built
there

might
just
a
well
pick
ani
spot
