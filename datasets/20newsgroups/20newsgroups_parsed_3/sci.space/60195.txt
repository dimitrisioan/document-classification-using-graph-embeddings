re
what
if
the
ussr
had
reach
the
moon
first
jame
thoma
green
write
if
they
had
beaten
u
i
specul
that
the
u
would
have
gone
head
and
done
some
land
but
we
also
would
have
been
more
determin
to
set
up
a
base
both
in
earth
orbit
and
on
the
moon
whether
or
not
we
would
be
on
mar
by
now
would
depend
upon
whether
the
soviet
tri
to
go
set
up
a
lunar
base
would
have
stretch
the
budget
of
both
nation
and
i
think
that
the
militari
valu
of
a
lunar
base
would
outweigh
the
valu
of
go
to
mar
at
least
in
the
short
run
thu
we
would
have
concentr
on
the
moon
great
specul
i
rememb
be
proud
on
behalf
of
all
the
free
world
you
think
that
way
when
you
are
seven
year
old
that
we
had
got
there
first
now
im
almost
sorri
that
it
work
out
that
way
i
guess
the
soviet
would
have
taken
the
victori
serious
too
and
would
almost
certainli
not
have
fallen
victim
to
the
complac
that
overtook
the
u
program
perhap
stretch
to
match
u
effort
would
have
destabil
them
sooner
than
it
did
in
fact
and
in
the
tradit
of
marvel
comic
what
if
thi
destabil
in
the
brezhnev
era
might
have
trigger
the
third
world
war
hmm
mayb
