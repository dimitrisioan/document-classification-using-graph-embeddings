for

arcjet
or
xenon
thruster
requir
huge
amount
of
power
so
you
have
to
have
either
nuclear

sourc
messi
danger
and
sourc
of
radiat
damag
or
big
solar
array
sensit
to
radiat
or
heavi
that
make
attitud
control
and
dock
a
big

if
you
go
solar
you
have
to

sourc

refuel
even
for

high

like
xenon
is
still
requir
and
turn
out
to
be
a
pain
you
either
have
to
develop
autonom
rendezv
or
long
rang
teleoper
to
do
dock
or
and
refuel
you
still
cant
do
much
plane
chang
becaus
the
deltav
requir
is
so
high
the

forc

thi

they
are
bide
their

till
the

and
the
problem
get
solv
not
imposs
in
principl
but
hard
to
do
and

cheaper
than

at
