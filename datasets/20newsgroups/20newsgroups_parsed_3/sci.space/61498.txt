re
hst
servic
mission
schedul
for
day
in
articl
write
after
all
the
space
walk
they
are
go
to
reboost
the
hst
orbit
i
think
right
now
it
sit
at
mile
up
they
would
like
i
dont
know
the
exact
orbit
number
a
ben
say
thi
reboost
idea
is
all
news
to
u
here
do
you
know
someth
we
dont
pleas
suppli
a
sourc
it
would
be
nice
for
the
schedul
of
observ
to
know
where
the
thing
is
go
to
be
these
altitud
number
are
also
way
off
my
best
sourc
ha
minimum
st
altitud
in
the
pmdb
is
kilomet
maximum
st
altitud
in
the
pmdb
is
kilomet
delta
st
altitud
in
the
pmdb
is

pmdb
is
propos
manag
data
base
use
to
schedul
observ
i
am
sure
your
number
are
far
better
then
mine
a
i
said
abov
i
dont
have
exact
number
in
order
to
perform
the
reboost
of
the
hst
the
om
engin
will
be
fire
for
a
long
period
now
the
shuttl
is
a
heavi
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
om
fuel
need
to
fli
both
up
is
substanti
a
small
booster
carri
up
and
use
to
boost
hst
on
it
own
will
weigh
significantli
le
then
the
om
fuel
requir
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttl
for
a
given
orbit
chang
could
you
suppli
some
calcul
you
might
check
some
recent
post
that
explain
that
a
small
booster
a
suggest
doe
not
now
exist
so
compar
the
mass
of
someth
that
doesnt
exist
to
the
mass
of
the
om
fuel
seem
imposs
the
contamin
threat
also
remain
how
differ
would
the
contamin
threat
of
a
small
manuev
tug
be
from
that
of
the
shuttl
and
it
om
engin
i
know
that
no
small
manuev
tug
exist
but
mayb
one
could
soup
up
a
bu
doe
anyon
out
there
have
the
declasifi
spec
on
hte
bu
would
it
be
abl
to
provid
enough
control
forc
to
balanc
the
hst
and
still
have
the
rocket
thrust
to
hurl
her
into
a
decent
high
orbit
or
the
hst
could
even
get
place
into
some
sort
of
medium
orbit
the
reason
they
want
a
high
orbit
is
le
antenna
point
and
longer
drag
life
longer
drag
life
i
can
understand
but
could
you
explain
the
antenna
point
sorri
that
should
be
intrument
point
whatev
it
is
the
problem
in
the
tilt
array
is
a
big
constraint
on
hst
op
tell
me
about
it
although
the
array
can
be
and
are
move
perfectli
well
util
the
second
electron
box
get
them
both
work
is
much
desir
so
a
to
reclaim
redund
plu
if
the
second
box
get
fritzi
you
could
be
in
shitter
vill
real
fast
i
dont
mean
to
jump
on
you
help
suggest
are
alway
welcom
and
we
all
know
the
more
idea
the
better
but
i
do
want
the
true
situat
to
be
describ
clearli
and
correctli
lest
some
get
confus
regard
wm
hathaway
the
problem
is
noon
seem
to
have
the
exact
number
when
the
mission
wa
plan
origin
at
spacewalk
and
astronaut
there
wa
enorm
concern
over
the
mass
margin
for
the
flight
they
have
now
plan
for
eva
an
day
mission
and
have
reserv
eva
and
an
emerg
eva
obvious
that
is
come
from
somewher
my
guess
is
the
om
burn
fuel
or
reboost
margin
i
just
figur
if
goldin
want
to
realli
prove
out
faster
cheaper
better
have
some
of
the
whiz
kid
slap
togeth
an
expend
space
manuev
tug
out
of
a
bu
and
use
that
for
the
reboost
it
ha
to
be
better
then
use
the
discoveri
a
a
tow
truck
pat
