write
i
am
a
bit
nervou
about
post
thi
beacaus
it
is
begin
to
stray
fron
the
topic
of
space
but
then
again
that
doesnt
seem
to
stop
alot
of
other
peopl
with
all
of
thi
talk
about
breath
at
high
pressur
i
began
to
think
about
the
movi
abyss
if
you
rememb
in
that
movi
one
of
the
charact
dove
to
great
depth
by
wear
a
suit
that
use
a
fluid
that
carri
oxegen
a
oppos
to
some
sort
of
ga
now
i
have
heard
that
mous
can
breath
thi
fluid
but
for
some
reason
human
are
unabl
to
doe
anyon
know
more
detail
about
thi
gregson
vaux
i
believ
the
reason
is
that
the
lung
diaphram
get
too
tire
to
pump
the
liquid
in
and
out
and
simpli
stop
breath
after
minut
so
if

go
they
better
not
put
you
on
hold
or
els

about
it
rememb
a

sever
more
