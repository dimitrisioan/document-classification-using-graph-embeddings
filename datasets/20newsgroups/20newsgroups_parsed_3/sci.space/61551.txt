mothership
for

and
cut
cost
in
a
recent
articl
write
okay
we
have
figur
out
that
a
mission
specif
to
pluto
is
to
larg
and
to
expens
id
hardli
call
the
current
pluto
fast
flybi
propos
too
larg
if
the
new
technolog
insert
current
take
place
succe
the
sc
mass
will
drop
to
kg
or
too
expens
million
fy
for
two
sc
especi
when
compar
to
other
nasa
planetari
mission
basic
what
i
mean
is
design
a
mother
ship
that
ha
piggi
back
probe
for
differ
missionsnam
differ
planet
each
probe
would
be
tie
in
with
the
mother
ship
or
earth
a
the
case
may
be
thi
is
good
when
and
if
we
go
for
mar
the
mar
mission
can
act
a
either
mother
ship
or
relay
point
for
the
probe
thi
propos
would
work
onli
if
your
variou
target
are
relaiv
nearbi
and
the
requir
minim
deltav
from
the
mother
ship
a
mission
to
the
main
belt
might
be
one
possibl
for
such
a
mission
i
recal
a
paper
be
present
at
an
aiaa
deisgn
confer
in
irvin
in
februari
where
such
a
propos
spacecraft
wa
design
by
some
grad
student
at
ut
austin
i
think
four
minispacecraft
would
detatch
from
the
main
sc
each
visit
a
seper
asteroid
and
then
return
to
the
main
sc
after
analysi
the
main
sc
would
then
be
target
for
the
most
interest
object
for
further
studi
now
if
i
