end
of
the

there
is
an
interest

piec
in

thursday

p

i
thought
id
post
it
to
stir
up
some
flame
war
i
mean
reason
debat
let
me
prefac
it
by
say
that
i
larg
agre
that
the
space
age
in
the
romant
sen
of
sever
decad
ago
is
over
and
that
project
like
the
space
station
miss
the
point
at
thi
time
read
for
exampl
what
new
the
weekli
physic
updat
we
get
here
on
the
net
it
clear
that
the
romanc
of
the
day
lie
in
the
ever
more
finegrain
manipul
of
matter
by
which
i
includ
biotechnolog
condens
matter
physic
with
it
spinoff
in
comput
hardwar
and
elsewher
and
the
amaz
thing
peopl
are
do
with
individu
atom
these
day
to
a
larg
extent
i
think
the
romanc
some
peopl
still
have
with
space
is
a
matter
of
nostalgia
i
feel
sure
that
someday
we
or
more
precis
our
mind
child
will
spread
across
space
unless
we
wipe
ourselv
out
but
i
think
that
man
space
explor
is
not
what
is
excit
about
what
we
can
do
now
anyway
let
me
quot
some
of
thi
articl
but
not
all
space
age
glori
fade
from

associ
at
mit
at
america
space
age
wont
have
to
suffer
through
the
angst
of
a
midlif
crisi
the
reason
is
that
the
space
age
is
alreadi
dead
the
technolog
no
longer
defin
our
time
and
the
public
ha
grown
weari

space

be

the
ideal

a

now
dead
befor
