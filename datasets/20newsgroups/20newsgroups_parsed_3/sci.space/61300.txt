write
if
reboost
the
hst
by
carri
it
with
a
shuttl
would
not
damag
it
then
whi
couldnt
hst
be
brought
back
to
earth
and
the
repair
job
done
here
reboost
may
not
be
a
problem
if
they
have
enough
fuel
if
they
dont
do
a
reboost
thi
time
they
will
definit
have
to
do
one
on
the
next
servic
mission
but
tri
to
land
a
shuttl
with
that
big
huge
telescop
in
the
back
and
you
could
have
problem
the
shuttl
just
isnt
design
to
land
with
that
much
weight
in
the
payload
is
it
becaus
two
shuttl
flight
would
be
requir
ad
to
the
alredi
horrend
expens
of
cours
that
is
a
concern
too
and
the
loss
of
scienc
dure
the
time
that
it
is
on
the
ground
plu
a
fear
that
if
it
come
down
some
bigwig
might
not
allow
it
to
go
back
up
but
the
main
concern
i
believ
is
the
danger
of
the
land
just
to
add
anoth
bad
vibe
they
also
increas
the
risk
of
damag
an
instrument
final
thi
is
a
chanc
for
nasa
astronanut
to
prove
they
could
build
