these
are
describ

a
exploit
the

in
a
three

the
probe
wa
launch
into
thi
region
for
the
earthmoonsun
system
where
the
perturb
affect
it
in
such
a
way
a
to
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
larg
expenditur
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natur
object
sometim
get
captur
without
expend
fuel
well
just
find
the
trajectori
that
make
it
possibl
the
origin
of
the
techniqu
said
that
nasa
wasnt
interest
but
that
japan
wa
becaus
their
probe
wa
small
and
couldnt
hold
a
lot
of
fuel
for
deceler
i
should
probabl
repost
thi
with
anoth

so
that
the
guy
on
the

would
see
that
thi
is
a
practic
