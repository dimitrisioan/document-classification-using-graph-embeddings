i
wouldnt

a

a
few
decad
from
now
when
the
sky
look
like

that
would
realli
make
me
sad
think
for
a
moment
about
the
technolog
requir
to
do
that
by
the
time
they
could
make
the
earth
sky
look
like
la
vega
the
peopl
could
afford
to
go
backpack
on
the
moon
round
trip
cost
for
kg
to
the
moon
would
be
about
the
same
a
kg
in
a
low
earth
advertis
orbit
veri
roughli
the
same
cost
a
a
smallish
billboard
therefor
if
such
ad
were
to
becom
common
place
that
would
have
to
be
a
veri
low
price
thi
is
nonsens
it

most
peopl
would
have
to
go
mile
or
more
if
we
ever
get
to
the
point
where
we
have
billboard
on

that
essenti
mean
that
no
place
on
earth
is
still
wild
while
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
the
orbit
billboard
arent
the
problem
they
are
just
a
symptom
of

ban
such
ad
will
not
save
your

becaus
by

you
