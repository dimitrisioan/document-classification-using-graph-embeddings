suppli
thi
would
not
be
a
cheap
advertis
cost
at
least
sever
million
of
dollar
exact
cost
were
not
avail
but
smi
estim
that
market
exposur
would
be
x
that
of
the
peopl
who
watch
the
superbowl
where
a
second
advertis
unit
cost
sinc
smi
is
locat
in
atlanta
georgia
it
is
be
promot
a
be
avail
in
time
for
the
open
of
the
summer
olymp
in
atlanta
but
back
to
brian
question
and
doe
anyon
have
ani
more
detail
other
than
what
wa
in
the
wn
news
blip
how
seriou
is
thi
project
is
thi
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
doe
it
have
real
fund
see
abov
a
for
seriou
if
they
can
get
m
or
so
my
estim
of
for
develop
cost
and
a
flight
unit
plu
m
for
a
launch
then
it
probabl
real
they
are
claim
to
tailor
the
orbit
to
overfli
specif
locat
at
specif
time
for
optimum
advertis
impact
so
they
probabl
cant
piggi
back
upon
someon
el
plan
launch
and
will
have
to
buy
a
dedic
launch
that
a
m
cost
they
need
to
rais
right
there
and
there
will
probabl
be
some
legal
challeng
to
thi
a
well
note
there
is
one
potenti
legal
challeng
to
smi
on
the
use
of
launch
vehicl
advertis
alreadi
while
i
dont
think
the
legal
challeng
would
win
out
and
ye
i
am
an
amateur
astronom
and
no
i
dont
realli
like
the
idea
of
thi
addit
light
pollut
but
i
know
of
no
prohibit
of
it
the
legal
challeng
and
court
fight
would
probabl
remov
ani
posit
aspect
of
the
advertis
i
can
imagin
sever
way
to
make
the
advertis
look
like
lout
for
do
thi
which
would
chang
posit
market
exposur
to
neg
market
exposur
and
negat
the
space
advertis
advantag
would
you
spend
m
to
look
like
an
idiot
and
light
pollut
might
not
be
too
bad
if
it
in
a
low
enough
orbit
and
it
reli
upon
reflect
light
onli
it
would
onli
be
visibl
for
a
short
time
just
after
local
dusk
and
befor
dawn
for
maximum
market
exposur
you
want
to
have
it
visibl
just
after
dusk
minim
impact
on
astronomi
sinc
that
the
time
of
wors
see
due
to
daynight
thermal
turbul
it
might
still
be
a
problem
but
perhap
there
are
way
to
mitig
thi
a
for
have
real
fund
none
that
i
can
identifi
there
were
about
express
of
interest
made
on
the
conestoga
advertis
opportun
but
that
includ
curiou
folk
and
wa
for
onli
a
commit
i
havent
heard
of
ani
seriou
fund
for
thi
but
im
sure
they
are
shop
the
ventur
around
look
for
some
money
in
order
to
flesh
out
the
concept
some
more
but
i
am
confid
there
are
no
firm
or
pay
custom
at
thi
time
and
if
anybodi
want
to
crosspost
thi
to
sciastro
pleas
be
my
guest
i
dont
have
