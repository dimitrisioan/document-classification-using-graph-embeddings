is
there
like
to
be
a
problem
with

never
expel
all
the

the

ha
to

pretti
quickli
with
the
residu
air
in
the

to
provid
a
use
partial
pressur
of
oxygen
right
would
thi
mix
be
substanti
fasterslow
at
the
pressur
were
talk
about
there
wa
an

articl
in
scientif
american
some
time
ago
about
breath
liquid
it
wa
a
few
month
befor
the
abyss
came
out
a
far
a
i
can
rememb
they
mention
three
thing
that
were
difficult
to
do
at
onc
with
a
substitut
breath
fluid
low
viscos
if
it
too
difficult
to
forc
the
fluid
in
out
of
the
lung
you
cant
extract
enough
oxygen
to
power
your
own
breath
effort
let
alon
anyth
els
diffus
rate
obvious
not
all
the
air
in
your
lung
is
expel
when
you
breath
out
and
the
part
that
isnt
expel
is
the
part
that
nearest
the
wall
of
the
alveolu
alveolu
so
the
trip
from
the
blood
vessel
to
the
new
air
ha
to
be
done
by
diffus
of

even
if
you

co
out
oxygenco
capac
you
have

oh
and
of

your

must
not
