the
orion
spacedr
wa
a
theoret
concept
it
would
be
a
drive
use
thermonuclear
explos
to
drive
a
spacecraft
the
idea
wa
that
youd
deton
devic
with
somewher
from
one
to
ten
megaton
yield
behind
a
pusher
plate
attach
to
the
main
spacecraft
the
shock
wave
from
the
explos
would
transfer
momentum
to
the
ship
now
in
an
atmospher
i
can
see
thi
the
energi
of
the
explos
heat
the
atmospher
which
expand
explos
and
slam
a
shock
wave
into
the
pusher
plate
but
in

onli

i
can

much

especi
given
the

of

and
it
seem
to
me
your
go
to
get
more

transfer
throw
the
bomb
out
the

you
get
