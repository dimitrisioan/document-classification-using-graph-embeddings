re
what
if
the
ussr
had
reach
the
moon
first
in
articl
jame
thoma
green
write
suppos
the
soviet
had
manag
to
get
their
moon
rocket
work
and
had
made
it
first
they
could
have
beaten
u
if
either
their
rocket
hadnt
blown
up
on
the
pad
thu
set
them
back
andor
a
saturn
v
went
boom
the
apollo
fire
wa
harsh
a
saturn
v
explos
would
have
been
hurt
but
the
soviet
win
would
have
been
crush
that
could
have
been
the
technolog
turn
point
for
the
u
turn
u
from
today
we
can
do
anyth
were
the
super
power
to
a
much
more
reserv
attitud
like
the
soviet
program
today
kennedi
wa
gone
by
the
war
wa
still
on
is
the
east
i
think
the
program
would
have
stall
badli
and
the
goal
of
the
moon
by
would
have
been
dead
with
nasa
tri
to
figur
were
they
went
wrong
if
they
had
beaten
u
i
specul
that
the
u
would
have
gone
head
and
done
some
land
but
we
also
would
have
been
more
determin
to
set
up
a
base
both
in
earth
orbit
and
on
the
moon
whether
or
not
we
would
be
on
mar
by
now
would
depend
upon
whether
the
soviet
tri
to
go
set
up
a
lunar
base
would
have
stretch
the
budget
of
both
nation
and
i
think
that
the
militari
valu
of
a
lunar
base
would
outweigh
the
valu
of
go
to
mar
at
least
in
the
short
run
thu
we
would
have
concentr
on
the
moon
i
speulat
that
the
saturn
program
would
have
been
push
into
the
s
with
cost
over
run
that
would
just
be
too
evil
nixon
still
win
the
shuttl
wa
never
propos
and
skylab
never
built
by
the
program
stall
yet
again
under
the
fuel
crisi
a
string
of
small
launch
mark
the
mid
seventi
by
the
goal
of
a
u
man
on
the
moon
is
dead
and
the
u
space
program
drift
till
the
present
day
jame
t
green
i
believ
that
thi
nation
should
commit
itself
to
achiev
the
goal
befor
thi
decad
is
out
of
land
a
man
on
the

and
return
him
safe
to
