if
you
want
peopl
to
back
the
space
program
it
must
be
a
good
thing
in
and
of
itself
i
think
we
should
tell
them
about
the
thing
that
they
are
use
now
that
are
spinoff
of
the
space
program
that
is
the
onli
way
you
can
prove
it
worth
to
them
and
they
vote
and
pay
tax
too
the
continu
exist
of
the
space
program
reli
upon
that
money
i
have
to
agre
with
ward
the
problem
with
your
approach
is
they
add
up
what
you
can
reason
claim
a
spinoff
add
up
what
been
spent
on
space
and
then
come
back
with
someth
like
you
spent
x
billion
for
that
wouldnt
it
be
better
just
to
spend
the
money
on
direct
research
and
forget
all
thi
space
stuff
we
could
have
got
all
that
stuff
a
lot
cheaper
that
way
space
is
wast
and
ineffici
then
they
cancel
your
fund
and
spend
it
studi
mate
ritual
of
new
guinea
tribesman
or
someth
insist
on
perfect

is
