ive
been
look
for
that

for
ten
year
and
never
found
it
note
that
i
am
not
look
for
a
collector
item
im
hope
that
someon

publish
it
in
modern
time
either
in
paperback
or
hardcov
im
will
to
spend
or
so
to
get
a
copi
i
too
am
a
jule
vern
collector
and
can
tell
you
that
though
tough
to
find
it
is
out
there
i
keep
my
eye
open
all
the
time
for
hi
book
at
variou
bay
area
use
book
store
and
everi
onc
in
a
while
get
veri
lucki
you
just
need
dilig
i
dont
know
if
the
book
store
situat
near
jsc
is
a
good
a
the
bay
area
but
good
luck
i
have
also
had
excel
luck
at
the
antiquarian
book
fair
which
come
to
sf
everi
other
year
though
the
price
are
more
in
the
rang
than
the
you

guess
is

wont
need
to
spend
even
that
much
sinc
most
peopl
dont
care
about

i
found
one
day
at
a
small
bookshop
that
happen
to
have
just
bought
a
lot
of
random
book
at
an
estat
sale
of
cours
if
you
re
will
to
buy
blind
you
can
put
a
advertis
in
the
antiquarian
booksel
newslett
the
exact
titl
of
which
escap
me
at
the
moment
five
week
in
a
balloon
is
not
the
rarest
of
jule
vern
book
someon
ha

the
ab
is
the
way
to
