what
new
in
my
opinion
friday
april
washington
dc
now
space
market
is
work
with
univers
of
colorado
and
livermor
engin
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflat
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
thi
sound
like
someth
lowel
wood
would
think
of
doe
anyon
know
if
he
involv
no
the
idea
wa
suggest
around
here
dure
discus
of
possibl
nearterm
commerci
space
activ
one
of
the
folk
involv
in
those
discus
a
spacecraft
engin
name
preston
carter
pas
the
suggest
on
to
some
entreprenuri
type
and
mike
lawson
is
appar
go
ahead
with
it
preston
is
now
at
llnl
and
is
work
with
space
market
on
the
sensor
that
might
be
carri
nasa
would
provid
contractu
launch
servic
howev
sinc
nasa
base
it
charg
on
serious
flaw
cost
estim
wn
mar
the
taxpay
would
bear
most
of
the
expens
actual
that
sound
unlik
i
dont
know
what
the
launch
vehicl
would
be
but
i
would
expect
it
to
go
on
a
commerci
launcher
certainli
not
on
the
shuttl
and
the
fraction
of
the
cost
paid
to
nasa
for
eg
launch
support
would
probabl
cover
nasa
increment
cost
pretti
well
thi
may
look
like
environment
vandal
but
mike
lawson
ceo
of
space
market
told
u
yesterday
that
the
real
purpos
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environ
the
platform
will
carri
ozon
monitor
he
explainedadvertis
is
just
to
help
defray
cost
thi
may
be
the
purpos
for
the
univers
of
colorado
peopl
my
guess
is
that
the
purpos
for
the
livermor
peopl
is
to
learn
how
to
build
larg
inflat
space
structur
no
a
note
llnl
is
involv
in
lightweight
sensor
design
per
clementin
and
relat
program
im
sure
folk
around
here
would
like
to
see
a
demonstr
of
a
modern
inflat
structur
but
after
all
the
u
did
the
echo
satellit
long
ago
and
an
advertis
structur
would
not
be
much
closer
to
an
inflat
space
station
than
echo
wa
or
a
parad
balloon
for
that
matter
what
do
you
think
of
thi
revolt
and
hideou
attempt
to
vandal
the
night
sky
it
is
not
even
april
anymor
while
i
happen
to
person
dislik
the
idea
mostli
becaus
ive
got
a
background
in
astronomi
it
hardli
vandal
it
would
be
a
shortliv
intrus
on
the
night
sky
do
no
perman
damag
and
actual
hurt
onli
a
small
subset
of
astronom
on
the
other
hand
it
would
certainli
draw
attent
to
space
if
thi
is
true
i
think
it
a
great
idea
learn
how
to
build
structur
in
space
in
an
essenti
step
toward
space
develop
which
unfortun
thi
is
not
like
to
contribut
much
to
if
such
a
project
also
monitor
ozon
deplet
and
demonstr
creativ
use
of
partial
privat
sector
fund
in
the
process
so
much
the
better
is
nasa
realli
support
thi
junk
a
far
a
i
know
it
a
pure
commerci
ventur
and
doe
anyon
have
ani
more
detail
other
than
what
wa
in
the
wn
news
blip
how
seriou
is
thi
project
is
thi
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
doe
it
have
real
fund
i
gather
it
is
be
veri
serious
discus
with
possibl
advertis

howev
gener
dont

they
get

whether
