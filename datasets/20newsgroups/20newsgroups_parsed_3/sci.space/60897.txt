thi
is
turn
into
what
a
moonbas
good
for
and
i
ought
not
to
post
when
ive
a
hundr
some
odd
post
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
econom
sinc
someon
with
space
industri
will
presum
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industri
eventu
they
will
simpli
be
abl
to
afford
more
stuff
if
i
read
you
right
your
say
in
essenc
that
with
a
larger
economi
nation
will
have
more
discretionari
fund
to
wast
on
a
lunar
facil
that
wa
certainli
partial
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
coloni
will
probabl
requir
a
continu
militari
scientif
or
commerci
reason
for
be
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the
money
whi
not
approach
ah
but
the
whole
point
is
that
money
spent
on
a
lunar
base
is
not
wast
on
the
moon
it
not
like
theyd
be
use
r
bill
to
fuel
their
moondoz
the
money
to
fund
a
lunar
base
would
be
spent
in
the
countri
to
which
the
base
belong
it
a
way
of
fund
hightech
research
just
like
darpa
wa
a
good
excus
to
fund
variou
field
of
research
under
the
pretens
that
it
wa
crucial
to
the
defens
of
the
countri
or
like
esprit
is
a
good
excus
for
the
ec
to
fund
research
under
the
pretens
that
it
good
for
paneuropean
cooper
now
mayb
you
think
that
governmentfund
research
is
a
wast
of
money
in
fact
im
pretti
sure
you
do
but
it
doe
count
a
invest
spend
which
doe
boost
the
economi
and
just
look
at
the
size
