wwii
the

depart
found
that
pure
scientist
could
do
quit
well
with
their
problem
even
though
they
were
not
exactli
in
the
area
of
the
scientist
expertis
thi
is
probabl
becaus
of
the
research
mind
approach
which
is
not
to
tri
to
find
a
solut
but
to
understand
the
problem
and
see
if
a
solut
emerg
thi
work
in
stage
and
a
research
scientist
were
use
to
discuss
about
their
problem
the
job
got
done
the
militari
realiz
the
import
of
maintain
scientist
for
the
futur
and
start
fund
pure
research
after
wwii
but
congress
wa
unwil
to
have
militari
fund
divert
into
thi
invest
into
the
futur
suppli
of
scientist
and
set
up
other
organ
such
a
nsf
to
do
the
job
it
also
set
up
an
elabor
procedur
to
supposedli
keep
polit
out
also
the
govern
did
a
job
on
privat
foundat
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
act
to
support
research
the
worst
part
of
the
feder
involv
is
that
in
those
area
in
which
the
govern
support
research
the
univers
will
not
provid
fund
and
in
fact
expect
it
scholar
to
bring
in
net
govern
money
suppos
a
ha
been
the
case
i
have
a
project
which
could
use
the
assist
of
a
graduat
student
for
a
few
month
what
do
you
think
happen
if
i
ask
for
one
the
answer
i
will
get
is
get
the
money
from
nsf
now
the
money
at
the
univers
level
is
a
few
thousand
but
at
the
nsf
level
it
come
to
about
thousand
and
is
like
to
keep
a
faculti
member
from
get
support
so
the
govern
is
in
effect
decid
which
project
get
support
and
how
much
also
the
govern
decid
that
the
wealth
should
be
spread
so
instead
of
have
a
moder
number
of
univers
which
were
primarili
research
institut
the
idea
that
more
school
should
get
into
the
act
came
into
be
and
instead
of
evalu
scholar
they
had
to
go
to
evalu
reseach
propos
a
a
research
i
can
tell
you
that
ani

ha
to
be

it
a
the
result
of
the

what
i
am

today
i
may
solv
befor
the

is

i
may
find

i
may
find
that
it
is

in

tomorrow
i
may

i
may

a

which
solv
yesterday
too
difficult
problem
or
a
whole

to
someth
i
had
not

can
develop
thi
is
the
natur
of
the

and
except
for
realli
vagu
statement
if
someth
can
be
predict
it
is
not

develop

not

i
believ
that
at
thi

than
would
have
happen
if
