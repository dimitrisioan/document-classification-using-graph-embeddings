do
spacecraft
have
to

cut
for
exampl
whi
couldnt
magellan
just
be
told
to
go
into
a
safe
mode
and
stay
bob
about
venu
in
a
lowpowerus
mode
and
if
mayb
in
a
few
year
if
fund
get
restor
after
the
economi
get
better
hope
it
could
be
turn
on
again
for
that
matter
whi
exactli
were
the
apollo
lunar
experi
turn
off
rather
than
just
safe
wa
it

peski
scientist
out
of
the
bureaucrat
hair
ive
heard
the
argument
that
an
activ
but
uncontrol
spacecraft
caus
radio
nois
i
find
that
hard
to
believ
that
thi
could
be
a
problem
in
a
properli
design
safe
mode
thi
safe
mode
could
be
a
program
routin
which
caus
the
spacecraft
to
go
to
least
fuel
use
orient
and
onc
a
week
month
year
whatev
attempt
a
signal
lock
on
earth
at
that
time
if
fund
ha
been
restor
the
mission
can
continu
if
no
signal
is
reciev
the
spacecraft
go
back
to
the
safe
mode
for
anoth
time
period
a
we
would
know
when
the
spacecraft
is
go
to
tri
to
contact
earth
we
could
be
prepar
if
necessari
a
anoth
a
spacecraft
could
do
at
the
attempt
contact
is
beam
store
data
toward
earth
if
someon
can
receiv
it
great
if
not
so
it
lost
and
no
big
deal
by
make
the
time
and
signal
locat
gener
known
perhap
someon
in
the
world
might
be
abl
and
will
to
intercept
the
data
even
if
theyr
not
will
to
contact
the
spacecraft
i
see
thi
a
be
particularli
use
for
spacecraft
which
could
have
an
otherwis
long
life
and
are
in
or
are
go
to
place
which
are
otherwis
unaccess
jupitersaturn
orbit
exit
the
solar
system
etc
perhap
those
design
futur
spacecraft
cassini
pluto
flybi
etc
should
consid
design
in
a
paus
mode
in
case
their
spacecraft
get
the
ax
sometim
in
the
futur
after
complet
of
the
primari
mission
perhap
mar
observ
and
galilleo
could
have
some
kind
of
routin
written
in
for
the
post
mission
drift
phase
so
ani
hole
in
all
thi
jame
t
green
i
believ
that
thi
nation
should
commit
itself
to
achiev
the
goal
befor
thi
decad
is
out
of
land
a
man
on
the
moon
and
return
him
safe
to
the
earth
