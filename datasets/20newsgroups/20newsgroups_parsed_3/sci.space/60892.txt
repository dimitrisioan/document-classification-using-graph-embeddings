noth
that
reston
doe
could
not
be
dont
better
or
cheaper
at
the
other
nasa
center
where
the
work
is
go
on
integr
could
be
done
better
at
the
center
apollo
integr
wa
done
here
at
msfc
and
that
did
not
turn
out
so
bad
the
philosophi
of
reston
is
total
wrong
allen
there
you
have
a
bunch
of
peopl
who
are
complet
remov
from
the
work
that
they
are
tri
to
overse
there
is
no
way
that
will
ever
work
it
ha
never
work
in
ani
larg
scale
project
that
it
wa
ever
tri
on
could
you
imagin
a
reston
like
set
up
for
apollo
denni
reston
ha
been
the
onli
nasa
agenc
work
to
reduc
cost
when
wp
wa
hemorag
out
a
billion
the
center
you
love
so
much
where
do
their
best
to
cover
it
up
and
ignor
the
problem
reston
wa
the
onli
place
you
would
find
peopl
actual
interest
in
solv
the
problem
and
build
a
station
oh
you
are
full
of
it
allen
on
thi
one
i
agre
that
jsc
screw
up
big
they
should
be
respons
for
that
screw
up
and
the
peopl
that
caus
it
replac
to
make
a
stupid
statement
like
that
just
show
how
deep
your
bia
go
come
to
msfc
for
a
coupl
of
week
and
you
will
find
out
just
how
wrong
you
realli
are
mayb
not
peopl
like
you
believ
exactli
what
they
want
to
believ
no
matter
what
the
fact
are
contrari
to
it
kinda
funni
isnt
it
that
someon
who
talk
about
a
problem
like
thi
is
at
a
place
where
everyth
is
overhead
when
you
have
a
bit
more
experi
denni
you
will
realiz
that
integr
isnt
overhead
it
is
the
singl
most
import
part
of
a
success
larg
scale
effort
i
agre
that
integr
is
the
singl
most
import
part
of
a
success
larg
scale
effort
what
i
completli
disagre
with
is
seper
that
integr
function
from
the
peopl
that
are
do
the
work
it
is
call
leadership
allen
that
is
what
made
apollo
work
final
respons
for
the
success
of
apollo
wa
held
by
le
than
peopl
that
is
leadership
and
respons
there
is
neither
when
you
have
ani
organ
set
up
a
reston
is
you
could
take
the
same
peopl
and
move
them
to
jsc
or
msfc
and
they
could
do
a
much
better
job
whi
did
it
take
a
year
for
reston
to
final
say
someth
about
the
problem
if
they
were
on
site
and
part
of
the
process
then
the
problem
would
have
never
gotten
out
of
hand
in
the
first
place
there
is
one
heck
of
a
lot
i
do
not
know
allen
but
one
thing
i
do
know
is
that
for
a
project
to
be
success
you
must
have
leadership
i
rememb
all
of
the
turn
over
at
reston
that
kept
ssf
program
in
shambl
for
year
do
you
it
is
lack
of
respons
and
leadership
that
is
the
program
problem
lack
of
leadership
from
the
white
hous
congress
and
at
reston
nasa
is
onli
a
symptom
of
a
greater
nation
problem
you
are
so
narrowli
focus
in
your
effort
that
you
do
not
see
thi
whi
did
the
space
news
artic
point
out
that
it
wa
the
congression
demand
chang
that
caus
the
problem
methink
that
you
are
be
select
with
the
fact
again
the
stori
you
refer
to
said
that
some
nasa
peopl
blame
it
on
congress
supris
supris
the
fact
remain
that
it
is
the
center
you
support
so
much
who
cover
up
the
overhead
and
wouldnt
address
the
problem
until
the
press
publish
the
stori
are
you
say
the
reston
manag
where
wrong
to
get
nasa
to
address
the
overrun
you
approv
of
what
the
center
did
to
cover
up
the
overrun
no
i
am
say
that
if
they
were
locat
at
jsc
it
never
would
have
happen
in
the
first
place
if
it
take
four
flight
a
year
to
resuppli
the
station
and
you
have
a
cost
of
million
a
flight
then
you
pay
billion
a
year
you
state
that
your
friend
at
reston
said
that
with
the
current
station
they
could
resuppli
it
for
a
billion
a
year
if
the
wrap
were
gone
thi
mere
point
out
a
blatent
contridict
in
your
number
that
understand
you
fail
to
see
you
should
know
denni
that
nasa
doesnt
includ
transport
cost
for
resupli
that
come
from
the
shuttl
budget
what
they
where
say
is
that
oper
cost
could
be
cut
in
half
plu
transport
sorri
gang
but
i
have
a
deadlin
for
a
satellit
so
someon
els
is
go
to
have
to
do
allen
math
for
him
for
a
while
i
will
have
littl
chanc
to
do
so
i
do
hope
you
can
find
the
time
to
tell
u
just
whi
it
wa
wrong
of
reston
to
ask
that
the
problem
with
wp
be
address
i
have
the
time
to
reiter
one
more
timet
that
if
the
leadership
that
is
at
reston
wa
on
site
at
jsc
the
problem
never
would
have
happen
total
ignor
the
lack
of
leadership
of
congress
thi
mani
head
hydra
that
ha
grown
up
at
nasa
is
the
true
problem
of
the
agenc
and
to
tri
to
chang
the
question
to
suit
you
