newsgroup
in

write
the
first
item
of
busi
is
to
establish
the
import
space
life
scienc
in
the
whole
of
scheme
of
humankind
i
mean
compar
to
footbal
and
basebal
the
averag
joe
schmoe
doesnt
seem
interest
or
even
curiou
about
spaceflight
i
disagre
it
think
the
averag
joe
is
interestedcuri
about
spaceflight
but
see
it
a
an
elitist
activ
not
one
which
he
is
ever
go
to
particip
in
all
of
u
in
our
own
way
can
contribut
to
a
comprehens
document
which
can
be
releas
to
the
gener
public
around
the
world
the
document
would
scientif
analyz
the
technic
aspect
of
long
term
human
habit
in
space
whi
is
the
gener
public
go
to
be
interest
in
the
technic
detail
of
long
term
space
habit
i
like
the
idea
of
the
studi
but
it
should
be
releas
to
other
scientist
and
engin
who
will
be
abl
to
use
it
if
you
want
a
gener
public
document
youll
need
a
more
gener
public
i
believ
that
if
ani
longterm
space
explor
program
is
to
succeed
we
need
to
basic
learn
how
to
engin
our
own
microworld
ie
the
spacecraft
onli
through
the
care
analysi
of
engin
chemic
biolog
and
medic
factor
will
a
good
ecosystem
be
creat
to
facilit
human
life
on
a
longdur
flight
a
one
work
on
control
ecolog
life
support
system
engin
the
microworld
isnt
the
problem
the
problem
is
understand
the
basic
chemic
biolog
and
medic
factor
to
be
abl
to
engin
them
effici
for
exampl
the
onli
way
we
know
how
to
produc
food
is
from
plant
and
anim
food
synthesi
is
not
veri
far
advanc
so
we
have
to
orbit
a
farm
well
that
obvious
not
veri
effici
so
we
use
technolog
to
reduc
the
mass
and
grow
plant
hydropon
instead
of
use
dirt
thi
is
where
the
engin
come
in
but
new
technolog
bring
new
basic
question
that
we
dont
have
the
answer
to
like
in
dirt
we
can
grow
tomato
and
lettuc
right
besid
each
other
but
in
hydropon
it
turn
out
that
you
cant
do
that
the
lettuc
growth
is
stunt
when
it
grown
in
the
same
hydropon
solut
a
tomato
so
now
you
have
to
consid
what
other
plant
are
go
to
have
similar
interact
thi
mean
some
basic
appli
scientif
research
and
that
what
need
to
be
done
with
all
technolog
that
have
been
develop
so
far
we
also
need
to
find
out
how
they
interact
togeth
that
where
we
are
now
so
i
would
like
to
see
post
of
opinion
regard
the
most
object
method
to
analyz
the
accept
scientif
literatur
for
technolog
which
can
be
appli
to
longdur
spaceflight
first
you
need
to
do
the
literatur
search
there
is
a
lot
of
inform
out
there
mayb
we
should
just
pick
a
specif
area
of
long
term
habit
thi
could
be
use
especi
if
we
make
it
avail
on
the
net
then
we
can
look
at
method
of
analyz
the
technolog
such
a
detail
literatur
search
would
be
of
interest
to
ourselv
a
space
advoc
and
clearli
import
to
exist
space
program
in
essenc
we
would
be
divid
the
space
life
scienc
issu
into
variou
technic
problem
which
could
be
solv
with
variou
technolog
thi
databas
of
accept
solut
to
variou
problem
could
form
the
basi
of
detail
discuss
involv
peopl
from
the
bionet
isunet
and
ani
other
sourc
unless
there
is
an
unbeliev
outpour
of
interest
on
thi
on
the
net
i
think
we
should
develop
a
detail
data
base
of
the
literatur
search
first
then
if
we
accomplish
that
we
can
go
on
to
real
analysi
the
data
base
itself
could
be
use
for
futur
engin
that
my
respons
ken
what
do
you
think
