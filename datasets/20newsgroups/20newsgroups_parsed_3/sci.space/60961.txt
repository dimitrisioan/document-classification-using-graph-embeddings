a

a
we
know
it
ha
no

we
cant
get
cheaper
right
here
on
earth
or
from
asteroid
and
comet
asid
from
the
semimyth
he
that
might
be
use
in
low
grade
fusion
reactor
i
dont
know
what
a
low
grade
fusion
reactor
is
but
the
major
problem
with
he
asid
from
the
difficulti
in
make
ani
fusion
reactor
work
is
that
it
concentr
in
lunar
regolith
is
just
so
small
on
the
order
of
ppb
or
so
on
averag
more
in
some
fraction
but
still
veri
small
massiv
amount
of
regolith
would
have
to
be
process
thi
thread
remind
me
of
wingo
claim
some
time
ago
about
the
moon
a
a
sourc
of
titanium
for
use
on
earth
a
i
recal
wingo
wasnt
content
with
be
assur
that
titanium
at
in
the
earth
crust
averag
would
not
run
out
and
tout
lunar
mine
even
though
the
market
price
of
ilmenit
concentr
these
day
is
around
pound
thi
prompt
me
to
look
up
larg
potenti
terrestri
sourc
on
the
moon
titanium
occur
in
basalt
highti
basalt
apollo
and
have
titanium
dioxid
by
weight
thi
is
nice
but
terrestri
continent
flood
basalt
are
also
typic
enrich
in
titanium
they
veri
often
have
tio
frequent
have
and
sometim
even
tio
again
by
weight
these
flood
basalt
are
enorm
million
of
cubic
kilomet
scatter
all
over
the
world
siberia
brazil
the
nw
unit
state
ethiopia
etc
if
even
of
the
basalt
are
tio
thi
is
trillion
of
ton
of
tio
at
concentr
onli
a
factor
of
le
than
in
lunar
highti
basalt
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
disadvantag
of
the
moon
could
be
overcom
by
such
a
small
increas
the
concentr
of
the
ore
never
mind
the
richer
but
le
common
terrestri
ore
be
