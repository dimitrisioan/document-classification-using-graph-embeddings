after
all
the
space
walk
they
are
go
to
reboost
the
hst
orbit
i
think
right
now
it
sit
at
mile
up
they
would
like
i
dont
know
the
exact
orbit
number
a
ben
say
thi
reboost
idea
is
all
news
to
u
here
do
you
know
someth
we
dont
plea
suppli
a
sourc
it
would
be
nice
for
the
schedul
of
observ
to
know
where
the
thing
is
go
to
be
these
altitud
number
are
also
way
off
my
best
sourc
ha
minimum

st

use
to
schedul
observ
in
order
to
perform
the
reboost
of
the
hst
the
om
engin
will
be
fire
for
a
long
period
now
the
shuttl
is
a
heavi
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
om
fuel
need
to
fli
both
up
is
substanti
a
small
booster
carri
up
and
use
to
boost
hst
on
it
own
will
weigh
significantli
le
then
the
om
fuel
requir
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttl
for
a
given
orbit
chang
could
you
suppli
some
calcul
you
might
check
some
recent
post
that
explain
that
a
small
booster
a
suggest
doe
not
now
exist
so
compar
the
mass
of
someth
that
doesnt
exist
to
the
mass
of
the
om
fuel
seem
imposs
the
contamin
threat
also
remain
or
the
hst
could
even
get
place
into
some
sort
of
medium
orbit
the
reason
they
want
a
high
orbit
is
le
antenna
point
and
longer
drag
life
longer
drag
life
i
can
understand
but
could
you
explain
the
antenna
point
whatev
it
is
the
problem
in
the
tilt
array
is
a
big
constraint
on
hst
op
tell
me
about
it
although
the
array
can
be
and
are
move
perfectli
well
util
the
second
electron
box
get
them
both
work
is
much
desir
so
a
to
reclaim
redund
pat
i
dont
mean
to
jump
on
you
help
suggest
are
alway
welcom
and
we
all
know
the
more
idea
the
better
but
i
do
want
the
true
situat
to
be
describ
clearli
and
correctli
lest
some
get
