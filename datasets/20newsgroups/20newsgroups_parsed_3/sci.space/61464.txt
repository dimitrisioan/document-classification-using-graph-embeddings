satellit
around
pluto
mission
in
articl
write
is
there
a
plan
to
put
a
satellit
around
each
planet
in
the
solar
system
to
keep
watch
there
would
be
some
point
to
do
longterm
monitor
of
thing
like
particl
and
field
not
to
mention
atmospher
phenomenon
howev
there
is
no
particular
plan
to
establish
ani
sort
of
monitor
network
to
be
precis
there
is
no
particular
plan
period
thi
is
a
larg
part
of
the
problem
in
thi
context
it
not
surpris
that
unexcit
but
use
mission
like
thi
get
short
shrift
at
budget
time
the
closest
approach
to
ani
sort
of
longterm
planetari
monitor
mission
is
the
occasion
chanc
to
piggyback
someth
like
thi
on
top
of
a
flashier
mission
like
galileo
or
cassini
how
about
a
mission
unman
to
pluto
to
stay
in
orbit
and
record
thing
around
and
near
and
on
pluto
it
is
most
unlik
that
there
is
much
happen
on
pluto
that
would
be
worth
monitor
and
it
is
a
prohibit
difficult
mission
to
fli
without
new
propuls
technolog
someth
the

commun

resist
be
the
guinea
pig
for
the
combin
need
to
arriv
at
pluto
within
a
reason
amount
of
time
and
then
kill
nearli
all
of
the
cruis
veloc
to
settl
into
an
orbit
is
beyond
what
can
reason
be
done
with
current
that
is
svintag
propuls
it
could
do
some
scan
of
not
onli
pluto
but
also
of
the
solar
system
object
near
and
aaroundpluto
a
well
a
seti
and
look
at
the
galaxi
without
have
much
of
the
solar
system
to
worri
about
most
of
thi
can
be
done
just
about
a
well
from
earth
the
few
thing
that
cant
be
can
be
done
better
from
a
voyagerlik
spacecraft
that
is
not
constrain
by
the
need
to
enter
orbit
around
a
planet
