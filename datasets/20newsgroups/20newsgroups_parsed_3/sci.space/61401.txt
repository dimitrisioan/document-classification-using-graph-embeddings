the

sourc
is

it

a

oort
sourc
is
a
model
of
bfield
pinch
by

it
got
too
mani
hole
in

to

but
at

it
wa
a
good
tri
so
you
have
a
plausibl
model
for
grb
at
astronom
distanc
recent
observ
have
just
about
rule
out
the
merg
neutron
star
hypothesi
which
had
a
lot
of
problem
anyhow
we
have
to
look
for
implaus
model
and
what
is
fundament
allow
independ
of

a
paper
on
the
possibl
of
grb
in
the
oort

just
came
through

is

the

the

of

put
them
at
cosmolog

but
a
long
a
there
is
no

indic
to
these

all
possibl
sourc
which
are

should
remain
under

thi
is
whi
the
oort

is
kept
on
the
list
although
there
is
no

from

unlik
a
it
may
seem
the

that
grb
origin
in

can
not
be

we
use
the

on
the
distribut
of
grb
the
bats
catalogu
up
to
march
and
the
catalogu
of
cometari
orbit
by
marsden
and
william
to
investig
whether
there
is
ani
observ
indic
for
correl

the
angular

of

and

assum

we
