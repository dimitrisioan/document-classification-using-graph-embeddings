re
gamma
ray
burster
where
are
they
well
i
seem
to
have
struck
an
interest
discus
off
given
that
i
am
not
an
astrophysicist
or
nuclear
physicist
ill
have
to
boil
it
down
a
bit
all
the
data
on
burst
to
date
show
a
smooth
random
distribut
that
mean
they
arent
concentr
in
galact
core
our
or
someon
el
if
the
distribut
is
smooth
we
are
either
see
some
enorm
larg
phenomenon
scatter
at
the
edg
of
the
univers
said
phenomenon
be
subject
to
debat
almost
a
vioent
a
the
phenomenon
or
we
are
see
some
phenomenon
out
at
like
the
oort
cloud
but
then
it
need
some
potent
littl
energi
sourc
that
isnt
detect
by
ani
other
current
method
we
know
it
not
real
close
like
slightli
extra
solar
becaus
we
have
no
parallax
measur
on
the
burst
the
burst
seem
to
bright
to
be
someth
like
black
hole
quantum
or
super
string
impact
or
someth
like
that
so
everyon
is
watch
the
data
and
argu
like
mad
in
the
meanwhil
what
i
am
wonder
is
thi
in
peopl
opinion
a
new
physic
problem
einstein
got
well
known
for
solvingth
photoelectr
effect
copernicu
start
look
at
irregular
in
planetari
motion
is
thi
a
big
enough
problem
to
creat
a
new
area
of
physic
just
a
littl
specul
think
