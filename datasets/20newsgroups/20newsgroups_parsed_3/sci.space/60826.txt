land
in

write
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
larg
expenditur
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natur
object
sometim
get
captur
without
expend
fuel
well
just
find
the
trajectori
that
make
it
possibl
the
origin
of
the
techniqu
said
that
nasa
wasnt
interest
but
that
japan
wa
becaus
their
probe
wa
small
and
couldnt
hold
a
lot
of
fuel
for
deceler
actual
hiten
wasnt
origin
intend
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
at
all
so
it
inde
didnt
have
much
fuel
on
hand
the
lunarorbit
mission
wa
an
afterthought
after
hagoromo
a
tini
subsatellit
deploy
by
hiten
dure
a
lunar
flybi
had
a
transmitt
failur
and
it
proper
insert
into
lunar
orbit
couldnt
be
posit
confirm
it
should
be
note
that
the
techniqu
doe
have
disadvantag
it
take
a
long
time
and
you
end
up
with
a
rel
inconveni
lunar
orbit
if
you
want
someth
use
like
a
low
circular
polar
orbit
you
do
have
to
plan
to
expend
a
certain
amount
of
fuel
although
it
is
reduc
from
what
youd
need
for
the
bruteforc
approach
all
