suggest
that
the
minor
of
profession
and
amateur
astronom
have
the
right
to
a
dark
unclutt
night
sky
sorri
you
have
a
wish
for
an
unclutt
night
sky
but
it
isnt
a
right
when
you
get
down
to
it
you
actual
have
no
right
that
the
major
havent
agre
to
give
you
and
them
in
the
process
it
a
common
misconcept
that
be
born
somehow
endow
you
with
right
to
thi
that
and
the
other
sadli
thi
is
not
true
now
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
respons
that
should
go
with
the
power
to
clutter
the
night
sky
then
that
a
differ
matter
greg
nichol
vidi
or
vici
veni
accord
to
thi
reason
there
are
no
right
at
least
none
that
i
can
think
of
let
see
do
i
have
a
right
to
unpollut
air
no
becaus
the
major
drive
car
and
use
good
that
creat
air
pollut
in
the
manufactur
process
do
i
have
the
right
to
clean
water
i
guess
not
by
the
same
reason
i
could
go
on
with
these
exampl
for
a
long
time
look
at
nazi
germani
becaus
of
the
major
jew
homosexu
black
and
other
that
were
differ
had
no
right
in
fact
they
were
terror
imprison
and
slaughter
in
thi
countri
did
black
have
the
right
to
be
free
from
slaveri
i
guess
not
becaus
the
major
said
that
slaveri
wa
good
for
them
i
think
that
a
right
ha
a
moral
imper
if
a
law
impos
by
the
major
is
immor
one
should
not
follow
it
in
fact
one
should
do
everyth
in
hisher
power
to
stop
it
of
cours
that
doesnt
mean
that
i
would
lose
all
common
sen
to
break
the
law
just
becaus
i
thought
it
wa
immor
i
pay
my
feder
incom
tax
even
though
i
am
moral
oppos
to
the
u
govern
take
my
money
and
spend
it
on
weapon
of
mass
destruct
and
terror
thi
is
precis
the
point
i
am
tri
to
make
we
should
persud
peopl
by
logic
point
out
that
it
is
in
their
selfinterest
to
let
all
have
equal
right
in
all
aspect
of
life
includ
adequ
hous
food
and
medic
care
i
just
happen
to
think
that
for
a
full
life
the
aesthet
of
beauti
and
joy
is
also
necessari
that
is
