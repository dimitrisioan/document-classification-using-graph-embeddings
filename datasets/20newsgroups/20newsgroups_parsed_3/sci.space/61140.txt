the

the

sirtf
base
on
the
key
factor
in
it
new
design
the
satellit
will
orbit
the

instead
of
the
earth
permit
the
use
of
an
atla
rocket
launch
instead
of
the
formerli
propos
and
heavier

the
main
advantag
of
the
solar
orbit
is
that
you
can
use
all
of
your

capabl
for
boost
the
payload
you
dont
have
to
carri
up
a
second
rocket
to

the

werner
said
the
other
advantag
to
a
solar
orbit
he
said
is
that
it
in
a
better
thermal
environ
away
from
the
heat
of
the
earth
addit
major
chang
in

includ
shorten

all

werner

and

werner

all

wa

with

congress

on

i

we
have
some

to

he

becaus
the

also
sirtf

sirtf
will

ad
but
the

put

on

we
have
