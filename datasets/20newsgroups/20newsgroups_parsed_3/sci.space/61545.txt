pat
write
given
that
what
i
describ
for
the
hst
seem
to
be
the
smt
ha
someon
actual
verifi
that
mass
is
the
predomin
constraint
on
thi
mission
you
seem
to
be
assum
it
without
give
support
evid
someon
from
nasa
post
that
there
were
veri
signific
mass
margin
on
the
hst
reboost
mission
a
while
back
i
had
ask
whi
not
carri
the
edo
pallet
up
and
the
answer
wa
the
mass
margin
were
tight
enough
they
werent
even
carri
extra
suit
so
how
much
mass
is
save
by
not
burn
the
om
that
the
critic
question
my
data
show
that
the
om
engin
hold
kg
of
propel
of
that
a
substanti
fraction
is
go
to
be
use
for
the
first
om
burn
the
reentri
burn
and
the
reserv
so
pat
tell
u
how
much
fuel
the
altitud
chang
is
go
to
take
and
how
much
the
edo
pallet
bu
and
extra
part
are
go
mass
if
you
can
make
the
number
work
out
then
ill
be
interest
after
you
show
u
that
it
can
be
done
then
tell
u
how
much
the
edo
pallet
bu
and
extra
equip
is
go
to
cost
whi
not
do
thi
quick
test
goldin
philosophji
of
faster
cheaper
better
build
a
real
fast
space
tug
to
handl
the
reboost
of
the
hst
use
clean
cryo
fuel
and
get
it
readi
befor
the
hst
mission
pat
thi
would
be
slower
more
expens
and
wors
where
wingo
when
you
need
him
come
on
knock
that
st
off
you
forget
that
dure
skylab
they
did
overnight
mission
plan
for
the
repair
eva
also
dure
thexd
intelsat
mission
they
did
overnight
wetf
simul
i
somehow
think
they
could
train
up
a
new
eva
in
month
first
while
astronaut
certainli
have
done
eva
with
minim
plan
that
wa
becaus
they
had
to
they
dont
like
to
do
that
a
a
gener
rule
second
rememb
whi
they
had
to
improvis
dure
intelsat
they
were
tri
to
attach
a
motor
to
a
piec
of
hardwar
that
wasnt
design
to
do
that
tri
to
shortcut
the
train
is
onli
go
to
make
a
repeat
more
like
third
they
dont
have
eight
month
they
have
howev
much
time
is
left
after
someon
come
up
with
a
plan
show
it
can
work
and
get
it
approv
you
may
think
i
have
a
pessimist
attitud
i
think
it
realist
im
not
say
that
the
engin
task
is
imposs
few
engin
task
are
what
im
say
is
that
thi
is
neither
cost
effect
nor
feasibl
under
nasa
manag
and
a

build
hardwar
anyth
can
be
built
if
you
want
it
bad
enough
you
forget
the
bu
is
alreadi
built
all
theyd
ahv
to
do
is
soup
it
up
even
test
it
on
a
delta
mission
all
they
have
to
do
is
soup
it
up
just
what
doe
that
mean
dont
get
into
thi
mode
of
negativ
besid

how
much
more
expens
is
the

the
second

is
a

you
have
neither
shown
that
it
would
be

there
is
