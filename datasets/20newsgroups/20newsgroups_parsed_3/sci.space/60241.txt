now
mayb
that
billion
wa
wise
spent
and
mayb
it
wasnt
but
the
work

should
stand
on
it
own
merit
not
distort
the
cost
of

project
congress

no
idea
of
the
existens
of
these
wrap
congress
ha
never
heard
the
term
center
tax
they
look
at
the
station
they
are
get
and
the
price
they
are

and
note
that
it
doesnt
add
up
they
wonder

bliss
unawar
that
a
third
of
the
money
is
go
for
someth
els
my
dear
friend
your
mix
fact
and
fiction
here
a
coupl
of
week
ago
when
i
first
read
thi
in
your
post
i
talk
with
one
of
the
cost
expert
here
in
space
station
at
headquart
if
you
wonder
whi
i
didnt
post
a
respons
immedi
i
do
have
a
real
job
im
suppos
to
be
do
here
at
headquart
dig
up
old
khz
data
look
into
sherzerkyg
claim
rate
pretti
low
on
the
totem
pole
of
prioriti
also
i
spent
last
weekend
in
kansa
citi
at
the
nation
scienc
teacher
associ
confer
extol
the
virtu
of
ssf
to
scienc
teacher
first
off
ye
the
concept
of
center
tax
or
wrap
doe
exist
if
i
recal
the
number
correctli
the
total
tax
for
the
ssf
program
for
thi
fiscal
year
is
around
million
thi
wa
comput
by
ad
up
the
wp
wp
and
wp
center
tax
with
the
ssf
budget
for
thi
fiscal
year
at
billion
my
calculat
say
the
tax
percentag
is
over
the
life
of
the
ssf
program
use
your
figur
of
billion
for
the
cost
of
ssf
a
tax
at
a
rate
come
to
million
thi
is
alot
le
than
billion
but
i
will
conced
it
still
an
appreci
amount
of
pocket
chang
i
should
note
that
your
estim
of
the
tax
rate
at
could
be
close
to
the
actual
rate
the
tax
is
onli
charg
on
fund
that
are
spent
at
the
center
kind
of
like
mcdonald
at
some
state
where
you
do
have
to
pay
sale
tax
if
you
eat
the
food
at
the
restaur
but
you
dont
if
you
get
it
takeout
for
exampl
at
wp
the
vast
bulk
of
the
fund
we
receiv
go
to
the
rocketdyn
contract
and
are
not
subject
to
the
center
tax
i
dont
have
the
number
in
front
of
me
but
id
guess
at
least
of
the
wp
fund
go
to
rocketdyn
so
you
could
be
right
about
a
tax
rate
of
but
it
onli
appli
to
fund
spent
at
the
center
and
not
to
the
prime
contract
thi
lead
to
the
obviou
question
what
is
the
govern
do
with
ssf
fund
that
dont
go
to
the
prime
contractor
ie
ok
wp
get
a
slice
of
the
billion
pie
a
big
portion
of
thi
slice
go
to
rocketdyn
what
happen
to
the
balanc
of
the
fund
which
arent
eaten
up
by
the
center
tax
at
wp
we
call
these

we

the

each

to

much
anyth
within
the
lewi
charter
most
of
the
tax
howev
go
to
fund
the
gener
servic
at
the
center
like
the
librari
the
central
comput
servic
divis
the
contractor
who
remov
the
snow
etc
thu
it
is
rather
difficult
to
determin
what
percentag
of
the
ssf
budget
doesnt
go
for
ssf
activ
to
get
an
accur
figur
you
would
have
to
take
the
annual
expenditur
for
the
librari
for
exampl
and
then
divid
by
the
amount
of
the
librari
fund
use
to
support
ssf
which
would
be
hard
to
comput
by
itself
how
would
you
figur
out
what
percentag
of
the
bill
for
aviat
week
for
year
is
billabl
to
ssf
would
you
base
it
on
the
personhour
ssf
employe
spend
read
avweek
versu
the
rest
of
the
center
personnel
you
would
then
have
to
compar
thi
estim
of
the
ssf
portion
of
the
librari
expens
with
the
portion
of
the
tax
that
go
to
support
the
librari
who
know
mayb
ssf
overpay
on
the
tax
to
run
the
librari
but
we
underpay
for
snow
remov
talk
about
a
burecrat
nightmar
my
last
point
is
that
i
cant
believ
your
claim
that
congress
ha
never
heard
of
the
term
center
tax
unfortun
all
of
the
nasa
testimoni
befor
congress
isnt
on
a
comput
so
i
cant
do
a
simpl
word
search
someplac
to
prove
you
wrong
but
sure
in
some
gao
audit
somewher
these
nasa
cost
method
were
document
for
congress
