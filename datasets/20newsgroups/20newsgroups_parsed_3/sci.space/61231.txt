re
gamma
ray
burster
where
are
they
from
graydon
if
all
of
these
thing
have
been
detect
in
space
ha
anyon
look
into
possibl
problem
with
the
detector
that
is
is
there
some
mechan
cosmic
ray
whatev
that
could
caus
the
dector
to
think
it
wa
see
one
of
these
thing
graydon
that
would
not
explain
whi
wide
separ
detector
such
a
on
ulyss
and
pvo
and
ginga
et
al
would
see
a
burst
at
the
same
time
in
fact
be
fore
bats
have
thi
wide
separ
interplanetari
network
wa
the
onli
sure
way
to
locat
a
random
burst
with
onli
one
detector
one
can
not
locat
a
burst
except
to
say
it
somewher
in
the
field
of
view
with
two
detector
one
can
use
the
time
that
the
burst
is
seen
in
each
detector
to
narrow
the
locat
to
a
thin
annulu
on
the
sky
with
three
detector
one
get
intersect
annulu
give
two
possibl
locat
if
one
of
these
locat
is
imposs
becaus
say
the
earth
block
that
part
of
the
sky
voila
you
have
an
error
box
bats
by
have
detector
of
it
own
can
do
it
own
locat
determin
but
onli
to
within
about
degre
would
someon
at
gsfc
like
david
like
to
comment
on
the
current
state
of
locat
determin
have
ind
pendent
sight
by
other
detector
help
drive
down
the
uncertainti
you
did
touch
on
someth
that
you
didnt
mean
to
though
some
believ
in
a
refer
that
i
have
somewher
that
absorptionlik
featur
seen
in
a
fraction
of
grb
can
actual
be
caus
by
the
detector
it
would
be
a
mean
nasti
god
though
that
would
have
a
nai
crystal
act
like
a
gauss
neutron
starbut
thi
is
get
too
far
afield
