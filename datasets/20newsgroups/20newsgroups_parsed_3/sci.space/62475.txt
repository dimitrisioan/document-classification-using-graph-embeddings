that

didnt

believ
the

repres
a

serious
though
your
never
go
to
get
a
meter
scope
into
orbit
a
cheapli
a
you
can
build
one
on
the
ground
and
with
adapt
optic
and
a
good
site
the
differ
in
qualiti
is
narrow
quit
a
bit
anyway
fc
that
would
be
true
if
adapt
optic
work
well
in
the
visabl
fc
but
take
a
look
at
the
paper
on
the
subject
they
refer
to
anyth
fc
up
to
micron
a
visabl
i
dont
know
about
you
but
most
fc
peopl
have
troubl
see
beyond
micron
or
so
there
are
fc
reason
to
think
adapt
optic
will
not
work
at
shorter
fc
wavelength
without
trueli
radic
improv
in

hmm
some
of
the
folk
in
thi
depart
plan
on
use
adapt
optic
at
the
m
at
palomar
for
nearinfrar
observ
