re
gun
for
space
okay
let
get
the
record
straight
on
the
livermor
ga
gun
the
project
manag
is
dr
john
hunter
and
he
work
for
the
laser
group
at
livermor
what
you
may
ask
doe
ga
gun
have
to
do
with
laser
noth
realli
but
the
gun
is
physic
locat
across
the
road
from
the
free
electron
laser
build
and
the
fel
build
ha
a
heavili
shield
control
room
thick
wall
from
which
the
gun
fire
are
control
so
i
suspect
that
the
offic
he
work
for
is
an
administr
conveni
i
visit
hunter
at
the
begin
of
feb
and
we
tour
the
gun
at
the
time
i
wa
work
on
ga
gun
rd
at
boe
where
i
work
but
i
am
now
do
other
thing
help
to
save
the
space
station
the
gun
us
a
methaneair
mixtur
which
is
burn
in
a
chamber
about
ft
long
by
inch
id
ie
it
look
like
a
pipe
the
chamber
hold
a
ton
piston
which
is
propel
at
sever
hundr
m
down
the
chamber
on
the
other
side
of
the
piston
is
hudrogen
ga
initi
at
room
temperatur
andsom
ten
of
atmospher
the
piston
compress
and
heat
the
hydrogen
ahead
of
it
until
a
stainless
steel
burst
diaphragm
ruptur
at
around
psi
the
barrel
of
the
gun
is
about
foot
long
and
ha
a
inch
bore
it
is
mount
at
right
angl
to
the
chamber
ie
they
intersect
thi
wa
done
so
that
in
the
futur
the
barrel
could
be
rais
and
the
gun
fire
into
the
air
without
have
to
move
the
larger
and
heavier
chamber
the
projectil
be
use
in
test
is
a
kg
cylind
of
lexan
plastic
in
in
diamet
and
about
cm
long
all
of
the
acceler
come
from
the
expans
of
the
hydrogen
ga
from
psi
downward
until
the
projectil
leaf
the
barrel
the
barrel
is
evacu
and
the
end
is
seal
with
a
sheet
of
plastic
film
a
littl
thicker
than
saran
wrap
the
plastic
is
blown
off
by
the
small
amount
of
residu
air
trap
in
the
barrel
ahead
of
the
projectil
the
gun
is
fire
into
a
bunker
fill
with
sandbag
and
plastic
water
jug
in
the
earli
test
fragment
of
the
plastic
projectil
were
found
at
the
higher
speed
in
later
test
the
projectil
vapor
the
test
is
into
a
bunker
becaus
the
livermor
test
rang
is
about
mile
across
and
the
projectil
would
go
km
if
fire
for
maximum
rang
the
intent
is
to
move
the
whole
gun
to
vandenberg
afb
after
the
test
is
complet
where
they
can
fire
into
the
pacif
ocean
and
use
the
track
radar
at
vafb
to
follow
the
projectil
the
design
goal
of
the
gun
is
to
throw
a
kg
projectil
at
km
half
of
orbit
speed
so
far
they
have
reach
km
and
the
gun
is
current
down
for
repair
a
on
the
last
test
they
blew
a
seal
and
damag
some
of
the
hardwar
i
think
it
had
to
do
with
the
methaneair
more
deton
than
burn
but
i
havent
had
a
chanc
to
talk
to
hunter
directli
on
thi
there
are
peopl
wait
to
test
scramjet
compon
in
thi
gun
by
fire
then
out
of
the
gun
into
the
air
at
mach
km
sinc
the
most
you
can
get
in
wind
tunnel
is
mach
thi
gun
cost
about
million
to
develop
and
is
basic
a
proofofconcept
for
a
bigger
gun
capabl
of
fire
use
size
payload
into
space
thi
would
requir
on
the
order
of
kg
projectil
which
deliv
on
the
order
of
kg
use
payload
to
orbit
