dci
trajectori
simul
ive
been
to
three
talk
in
the
last
month
which
might
be
of
interest
ive
transcrib
some
of
my
note
below

my

take

is
by
no
mean

assum
that
all
factual

note
for

the
delta
clipper
project
is
gear
toward
produc
a
singl
staget
to
orbit
reusabl
launch
vehicl
the
dcx
vehicl
is
a
scale
vehicl
design
to
test
some
of
the
concept
invovl
in
ssto
it
is
current
undergo
test
the
dci
vehicl
would
be
a
full
scale
experiment
vehicl
capabl
of
reach
orbit
it
ha
not
yet
been
fund
on
april
th
rocki
nelson
of
macdonnel
dougla
gave
a
talk
entitl
optim
techniqu
for
advanc
space
mission
here
at
the
univers
of
illinoi
mr
nelson
job
involv
use
softwar
to
simul
trajectori
and
determin
the
optim
trajectori
within
given
requir
although
he
is
not
directli
involv
with
the
delta
clipper
project
he
ha
spent
time
with
them
recent
use
hi
softwar
for
their
applic
he
thu
use
the
dci
project
for
most
of
hi
exampl
while
i
dont
think
the
detail
of
implicit
trajectori
simul
are
of
much
interest
to
the
reader
i
hope
they
arent
i
fell
asleep
dure
that
part
i
think
that
mani
of
you
will
be
interest
in
some
of
the
detail
glean
from
the
exampl
the
first
exampl
given
wa
the
maxim
of
payload
for
a
polar
orbit
the
main
restrict
is
that
acceler
must
remain
below
g
i
assum
that
thi
is
driven
by
passeng
constraint
rather
than
hardwar
constraint
but
i
did
not
verifi
that
the
delta
clipper
y
version
ha
engin
booster
and
sustain
the
booster
which
have
a
lower
isp
are
shut
down
in
midflight
thu
one
critic
question
is
when
to
shut
them
down
mr
nelson
show
the
follow
plot
of
acceler
v
time
g
a
ascii
graph
go
thi
is
actual
fairli
good
the
big
differ
is
that
the
line
g
made
by
the
should
be
curv
which
are
concav
up
the
data
is
onli
approxim
a
the
graph
wasnt
up
for
veri
long
g
g
sec
sec
a
mention
befor
a
critic
constraint
is
that
g
level
must
be
kept
below
initi
all
eight
engin
are
start
a
the
vehicl
burn
fuel
the
acceller
increas
a
it
get
close
to
g
the
booster
engin
are
throtl
back
howev
they
quickli
becom
ineffici
at
low
power
so
it
soon
make
more
sen
to
cut
them
off
altogeth
thi
caus
the
dip
in
acceller
at
about
second
eventu
the
remain
sustain
engin
bring
the
g
level
back
up
to
about
and
then
hold
it
there
until
they
cut
out
entir
the
engin
cutoff
doe
not
acut
occur
in
orbit
the
trajectori
is
aim
for
an
altitud
slightli
higher
than
the
nm
desir
and
the
last
vestig
of
air
drag
slow
the
vehicl
slightli
thu
lower
the
final
altitud
to
that
desir
question
from
the
audienc
paraphras
q
would
it
make
sen
to
shut
down
the
booster
engin
in
pair
rather
than
all
at
onc
a
veri
percept
worth
consid
they
have
not
yet
done
the
simul
shut
down
all
four
wa
part
of
the
problem
a
given
q
so
what
wa
the
final
payload
for
thi
trajectori
a
cant
tell
u
read
aviat
leak
he
also
appar
had
a
good
propuls
exampl
but
wa
told
not
to
use
it
my
question
doe
anyon
know
if
thi
secur
is
due
to
sdio
protect
nation
secur
or
md
protect
their
own
interest
the
second
exampl
wa
reentri
simul
from
orbit
to
just
befor
the
pitch
up
maneuv
the
biggest
constraint
in
thi
one
is
aerodynam
heat
and
the
paramet
they
were
tri
to
maxim
wa
crossrang
he
show
graph
of
heat
use
two
differ
model
to
show
that
both
were
veri
similar
and
i
think
we
were
suppos
to
assum
that
thi
meant
they
were
veri
accur
the
end
result
wa
that
for
a
polar
orbit
land
at
ksc
the
dci
would
have
about
degre
of
crossrang
and
would
start
it
reentri
profil
about
degre
south
latitud
i
would
have
ask
about
the
land
maneuv
but
he
didnt
know
about
that
aspect
of
the
flight
