thi
bit
interest
me
how
much
automat
control
is
there
is
it
pure
autonom
or
is
there
some
degre
of
ground
control
the
stickandrudd
man
is
alway
the
onboard
comput
the
comput
normal
get
it
order
from
a
store
program
but
they
can
be
overridden
from
the
ground
how
is
the
transit
from
aerodynam
flight
if
that
what
it
is
to
hover
accomplish
thi
is
the
realli
new
part
it
also
one
of
the
tricki
part
there
are
four
differ
idea
and
dcx
will
probabl
end
up
tri
all
of
them
thi
is
from
talk
to
mitch
burnsid
clapp
who
one
of
the
dcx
test
pilot
at
make
orbit
pop
a
drogu
chute
from
the
nose
light
the
engin
onc
the
thing
stabil
basefirst
simpl
and
reliabl
heavi
shock
load
on
an
area
of
structur
that
doesnt
otherwis
carri
major
load
need
a
door
in
the
hot
part
of
the
structur
a
door
whose
oper
is
missioncrit
switch
off
pitch
stabil
the
dc
is
aerodynam
unstabl
at
subson
speed
wait
for
it
to
flip
and
catch
it
at
degre
then
light
engin
a
bit
scari
light
the
engin
and
use
thrust
vector
to
push
the
tail
around
probabl
the
prefer
method
in
the
long
run
tricki
becaus
of
the
fuelfe
plumb
the
fuel
will
start
off
in
the
top
of
the
tank
then
slop
down
to
the
bottom
dure
the
flip
keep
the
engin
properli
fed
will
be
complic
build
up
speed
in
a
dive
then
pull
up
hard
lose
a
lot
of
speed
thi
thing
ld
is
not
that
great
until
it
head
up
and
the
vertic
veloc
drop
to
zero
at
which
point
it
start
to
fall
tailfirst
light
engin
also
a
bit
scari
and
you
probabl
dont
have
enough
altitud
left
to
tri
again
all
work
is
