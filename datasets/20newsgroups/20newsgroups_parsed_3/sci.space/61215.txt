re
gamma
ray
burster
where
are
they
in
articl
pat
write
what
evid
indic
that
gamma
ray
burster
are
veri
far
away
their
distribut
is
veri
isotrop
and
the
intens
distribut
crude
speak
indic
were
see
an
edg
to
the
distribut
given
the
enorm
power
i
wa
just
wonder
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
hole
or
someth
like
that
fairli
close
by
whi
would
they
have
to
be
at
galact
rang
now
in
the
good
old
day
befor
gro
data
it
wa
thought
the
gamma
burster
were
neutron
star
in
the
galaxi
it
wa
expect
that
gro
would
confirm
thi
by
either
show
they
were
a
local
popul
within
a
few
hundr
light
year
or
that
they
were
in
the
galact
halo
mechan
wa
not
known
but
sever
plausibl
one
exist
also
to
be
fair
it
wa
note
that
the
brightest
burster
wa
probabl
in
the
lmc
suggest
theorist
might
be
wrong
back
then
a
the
sun
is
not
at
the
center
of
the
galaxi
a
halo
popul
should
show
anisotropi
a
local
disk
popul
is
rule
out
complet
at
thi
stage
to
avoid
the
anisotropi
you
have
to
push
the
halo
out
the
energi
then
get
larg
the
mechan
of
get
n
out
that
far
becom
question
and
we
should
start
to
see
for
exampl
the
andromeda
burster
the
data
is
consist
with
either
a
oort
cloud
distribut
but
onli
just
but
no
one
can
think
of
a
plausibl
sourc
with
the
right
spectrum
or
it
can
be
a
cosmolog
distanc
henc
isotropi
and
the
edg
is
the
edg
of
the
univers
if
at
cosmolog
distanc
you
need
veri
high
energi
to
detect
and
a
veri
compact
sourc
for
spectrum
ergo
a
neutron
star
collid
with
anoth
neutron
star
or
black
hole
even
then
get
the
spectrum
is
veri
hard
but
conceiv
if
we
know
anyth
about
physic
at
that
level
the
burster
are
not
due
to
quantum
black
hole
or
cosmic
string
wrong
spectrum
for
one
thing
the
situat
is
further
complic
by
recent
claim
that
there
are
two
class
of
sourc
in
the
collid
n
theyd
actual
probabl
fit
rel
easili
into
the
nsn
and
nsbh
collis
scenario
respect
my
own
pet
theori
is
that
it
fli
saucer
enter
hyperspac
but
the
reason
i
am
ask
is
that
most
everyon
assum
that
they
are
collid
nuetron
star
or
spin
black
hole
i
just
wonder
if
ani
mechan
could
exist
and
place
them
closer
in
if
you
can
think
of
one
