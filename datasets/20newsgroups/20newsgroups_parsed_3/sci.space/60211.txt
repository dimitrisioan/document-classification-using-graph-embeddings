write
i
believ
the
reason
is
that
the
lung
diaphram
get
too
tire
to
pump
the
liquid
in
and
out
and
simpli
stop
breath
after
minut
so
if
your
in
the
vehicl
readi
to
go
they
better
not
put
you
on
hold
or
el
that
about
it

a

is
sever
more

i
think
depend
on
the
ga
and
liquid
comparis
of
cours
could
you
use
some
sort
of
mechan
chest
compress
a
an
aid
sorta
like
the
portabl
iron
lung
put
some
sort
of
flex
tube
around
the
aquanaut
chest
cyclic
compress
it
and
it
will
push
enough
on
the
chest
wall
to
support
breath
youd
have
to
trust
your
breather
but
in
space
you
have
to
trust
your
suit
anyway
