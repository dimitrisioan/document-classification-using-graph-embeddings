write
well
spenzwhat
can
i
say
youv
attack
my
belov
vehicl
if
i
may
offer
a
construct
critic
perhap
you
should
decid
if
you
love
vehicl
or
the
use
they
are
put
to
i
myself
think
the
f
is
a
beauti
aircraft
but
rest
assur
i
wouldnt
even
think
of
fli
it
in
combat
today
most
of
u
want
access
to
space
and
judg
vehicl
on
how
they
perform
we
see
zerodefect
oper
in
mani
area
of
life
not
to
thi
degre
call
shuttl
flight
characterist
bizarr
in
the
same
post
a
tout
dcx
is
interest
whi
dcx
will
also
have
similar
zerodefect
issu
am
i
wrong
your
wrong
the
dc
approach
is
veri
toller
of
failur
it
also
ha
the
advantag
of
far
greater
reliabl
do
to
it
reusabl
natur
shuttl
isnt
reusabl
it
salvag
i
am
think
of
how
dcx
will
deploy
a
chute
or
revers
orient
at
superson
speed
the
flip
over
happen
at
a
veri
low
speed
not
superson
if
the
dcx
show
the
flip
over
work
it
will
work
unless
the
law
of
physic
chang
how
much
in
dcx
is
redund
that
the
real
question
the
final
dc
will
have
fulli
intact
abort
throughout
the
entir
flight
envelop
upon
reentri
for
exampl
it
can
loos
about
of
avail
thrust
and
still
land
safe
everyth
we
do
in
life
ha
zerodefect
issu
at
time
agre
everyth
can
suffer
from
catastroph
failur
but
that
not
the
same
thing
shuttl
simpli
isnt
a
fault
toler
design
ssto
is
a
a
doctor
i
can
not
error
in
my
diagnosi
and
treatment
recommend
you
dont
put
your
patient
in
condit
where
there
is
no
way
out
you
wouldnt
for
exampl
give
a
patient
a
drug
and
not
monitor
them
for
harm
side
effect
would
you
while
dcx
rd
program
make
good
sens
i
am
le
optimist
about
dcx
a
you
and
appar
other
are
you
are
veri
much
in
the
minor
if
the
dc
seri
fail
to
make
orbit
it
will
still
be
a
veri
worthwhil
effort
it
will
show
u
exactli
what
we
do
need
to
do
to
build
ssto
but
dcx
will
still
have
failur
it
is
the
natur
of
aerospac
rd
again
refer
to
the
dc
it
will
provid
fulli
intact
abort
theroughout
the
flight
envelop
shuttl
doesnt
dc
is

build

a
