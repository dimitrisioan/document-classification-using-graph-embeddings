a

from

orbit
may

the

element
what
i
wa
get
at
in
my
post
is
whether
or
not
it
might
be
possibl
to
put
enough
brain
on
board
futur
deepspac
probe
for
them
to
automat
avoid
such
thing
a
look
at
the
sun
or
go
into
an
uncontrol
tumbl
i
heard
onc
that
the
voyag
had
a
failsaf
routin
built
in
that
essenti
say
if
you
never
hear
from
earth
again
here
what
to
do
thi
wa
a
back
up
in
the
event
a
receiv
burnt
out
but
the
probe
could
still
send
data
limit
but
still
some
data
even
if
you
let
teh
bird
drift
it
may
get
hose
by
some
cosmic
phenomenon
sinc
thi
would
be
a
shutdown
that
may
never
be
refund
for
startup
if
some
type
of
cosmic
bem
took
out
the
probe
it
might
not
be
such
a
big
loss
obvious
you
cant
plan
for
everyth
but
the
most
obviou
thing
can
be
consid
jame

i
know
you
believ
you
understand
what
it
is
that
you
think
i
said
but
i
am
not
sure
that
you
realiz
that
what
i
said
is
not
what
i
meant
