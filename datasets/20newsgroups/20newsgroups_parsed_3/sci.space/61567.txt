write
that
fine
idea
but
it
onli
work
if
the
lightingpow
compani
even
bother
to
suppli
good
light
fixtur
for
instanc
a
power
compani
in
virginia
recent
ask
a
state
commiss
for
permiss
to
sell
more
light
of
variou
type
yet
all
of
the
differ
fixtur
that
they
sold
and
want
to
sell
uh
whi
do
they
have
to
ask
a
state
commis
unless
the
state
buy
such
a
process
will
onli
increac
the
overhead
to
the
power
compani
of
sell
differ
type
of
light
and
will
decreac
the
likleihood
that
they
will
do
so
and
ani
effici
light
they
might
have
been
plan
in
the
futur
go
down
the
drain
were
bad
design
one
that
wast
the
light
thu
you
couldnt
even
buy
a
good
light
from
them
in
most
place
to
get
a
good
light
you
have
to
either
order
it
special
at
high
cost
or
call
a
store
in
arizona
you
could
order
it
special
if
enough
peopl
did
so
it
would
be
low
cost
last
i
check
you
could
use
up
to
buy
stuff
in
arizona
befor
go
there
final
im
sure
your
state
ha
thing
like
small
factori
and
machin
shop
you
could
go
into
busi
make
light
that
are
cheaper
to
use
thank
to
their
higher
effici
and
the
fact
that
they
arent
wast
energi
on
broadcast
to
space
and
therefor
better
than
the
old
style
at
some
point
societi
start
to
make
rule
car
have
to
pas
safeti
test
five
year
plan
have
to
be
enact
or
the
plan
for
the
economi
will
fall
apart
compani
have
to
meet
pollut
standard
etc
a
if
the
clean
air
act
realli
clean
up
the
air
there
are
two
way
to
achiev
thi
educ
the
public
so
that
they
demand
good
light
or
forc
code
down
the
light
compani
back
histori
seem
to
suggest
that
the
latter
is
more
like
to
work
my
experi
seem
to
suggest
that
your
tri
too
hard
to
educ
them
with
the
same
method
use
in
american
school
to
make
ani
subject
whatsoev
a
relev
and
bore
a
protougr
instead
of
sell
them
on
the
idea
agre
so
i
wont
respond
again
it
import
for
all
you
spacer
out
there
to
realiz
that
some
peopl
will
object
to
variou
wild
idea
that
have
been
present
just
like
congress
it
would
be
best
to
consult
the
astronomerslov
of
the
night
sky
befor
you
tri
some
pr
stunt
to
boost
public
knowledg
about
space
well
wake
up
space
is
becom
a
field
of
human
endeavor
instead
of
just
someth
we
can
look
at
from
a
long
long
way
away
there
are
practic
space
project
that
could
conceiv
although
probabl
not
caus
lot
of
light
pollut
and
have
been
argu
against
on
those
ground
even
though
they
might
open
up
such
possibl
that
peopl
could
vacat
on
