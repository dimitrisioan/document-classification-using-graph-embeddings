newsgroup
write
in
respons
to
my
origin
post
first
you
need
to
do
the
literatur
search
there
is
a
lot
of
inform
out
there
mayb
we
should
just
pick
a
specif
area
of
long
term
habit
thi
could
be
use
especi
if
we
make
it
avail
on
the
net
then
we
can
look
at
method
of
analyz
the
technolog
such
a
detail
literatur
search
would
be
of
interest
to
ourselv
a
space
advoc
and
clearli
import
to
exist
space
program
in
essenc
we
would
be
divid
the
space
life
scienc
issu
into
variou
technic
problem
which
could
be
solv
with
variou
technolog
thi
databas
of
accept
solut
to
variou
problem
could
form
the
basi
of
detail
discus
involv
peopl
from
the
bionet
isunet
and
ani
other
sourc
unless
there
is
an
unbeliev
outpour
of
interest
on
thi
on
the
net
i
think
we
should
develop
a
detail
data
base
of
the
literatur
search
first
then
if
we
accomplish
that
we
can
go
on
to
real
analysi
the
data
base
itself
could
be
use
for
futur
engin
that
my
respons
ken
what
do
you
think
tim
well
i
agre
i
hope
other
chime
in
with
suggest
on
specif
technolog
which
could
be
appli
toward
the
mainten
of
an
earth
like
atmospher
on
a
longdur
spacecraft
tim
et
al
i
think
we
should
tri
look
at
atmospher
first
thi
seem
to
be
the
singl
most
fundament
issu
in
keep
anyon
aliv
were
all
taught
that
when
support
a
patient
you
look
for
maintain
airway
so
in
keep
with
my
trauma
train
and
keep
my
emerg
medicin
professor
happi
i
suggest
that
we
look
at
the
issu
surround
a
regener
atmospher
circuit
howz
that
