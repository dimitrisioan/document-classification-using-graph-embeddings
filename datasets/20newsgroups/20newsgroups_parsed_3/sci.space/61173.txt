he
predict
that
onc
we
get
use
to
see
what
realli
goe
on
in
russia
we
wont
worri
about
their
stabil
a
much
part
of
the
problem
with
cooper
ventur
is
the
problem
of
transfer
money
the
central
bank
ha
a
polici
of
take
hard
currenc
payment
put
in
their
coffer
and
replac
the
rest
with

one
of
the
big
problem
rimsat
ha
had
is
stonewal
by
the
western
satellit
industri
howev
intelsat
recent
bought
three
of
the
same
type
of
satellit
which
wa
rather
reassur
the
biggest
worri
most
peopl
have
about
russian
satellit
is
the
primit
technolog
and
shorter
lifetim
the
older
gorizont
horizon
satellit
have
a
lifetim
of
about
year
while
the
more
modern
express
satellit
compar
well
with
western
technolog
and
last
about
year
while
thi
is
much
shorter
than
year
for
western
satellit
sternberg
downplay
the
differ
at
these
price
they
can
afford
to
launch
new
one
in
addit
shorter
lifetim
mean
that
they
can
replac
their
equip
with
newer
technolog
so
they
will
be
abl
to
compet
better
than
older
