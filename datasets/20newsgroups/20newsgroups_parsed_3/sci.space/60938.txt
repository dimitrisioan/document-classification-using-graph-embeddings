what
if
the
ussr
had
reach
the

first

coffman
say
in

graydon
write
thi
is
turn
into
what
a
moonbas
good
for
and
i
ought
not
to
post
when
ive
a
hundr
some
odd
post
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
econom
sinc
someon
with
space
industri
will
presum
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industri
eventu
they
will
simpli
be
abl
to
afford
more
stuff
if
i
read
you
right
your
say
in
essenc
that
with
a
larger
economi
nation
will
have
more
discretionari
fund
to
wast
on
a
lunar
facil
that
wa
certainli
partial
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
coloni
will
probabl
requir
a
continu
militari
scientif
or
commerci
reason
for
be
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the
money
whi
not
approach
i
wa
assum
that
there
wont
be
a
moon
base
unless
it
make
a
profit
actual
if
it
doe
well
that
give
a
larger
gnp
which
lead
to
be
abl
to
spend
more
money
on
your
militari
includ
goshwow
space
stuff
assum
it
profit
rather
than
pay
for
itself
it
conceiv
that
luna
will
have
a
militari
purpos
it
possibl
that
luna
will
have
a
commerci
purpos
but
it
most
like
that
luna
will
onli
have
a
scientif
purpos
for
the
next
sever
hundr
year
at
least
therefor
lunar
base
should
be
predic
on
fund
level
littl
differ
from
those
found
for
antarct
base
can
you
put
a
person
base
on
the
moon
for
million
a
year
even
if
you
use
grad
student
you
might
be
abl
to
run
one
for
that
put
it
there
hardli
whi
do
you
think
at

a
coupl
centuri
befor
there
will
be
