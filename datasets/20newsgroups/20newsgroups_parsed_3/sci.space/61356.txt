re
what
planet
are
habit
i
would
appreci
ani
thought
on
what
make
a
planet
habit
for
human
i
am
make
asumpt
that
life
and
a
similar
atmospher
evolv
given
a
rang
of
physic
aspect
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physic
aspect
simpli
disallow
earth
like
condit
thi
is
a
good
question
there
are
major
blind
spot
in
our
understand
of
what
make
the
earth
habit
for
exampl
whi
doe
the
earth
atmospher
have
the
concentr
of
oxygen
it
doe
the
naiv
answer
is
photosynthesi
but
thi
is
clearli
incomplet
photosynthesi
by
itself
cant
make
the
atmospher
oxygen
a
the
oxygen
produc
is
consum
when
the
plant
decay
or
are
eaten
what
is
need
is
photosynthesi
plu
some
mechan
to
sequest
some
fraction
of
the
result
reduc
materi
on
earth
thi
mechan
is
burial
in
seafloor
sediment
of
organ
matter
mostli
from
ocean
sourc
howev
thi
burial
requir
continent
sediment
in
the
deep
ocean
the
burial
rate
is
so
slow
that
most
materi
is
consum
befor
it
can
be
sequest
thi
suggest
that
a
planet
without
larg
ocean
or
a
planet
without
contin
undergo
weather
will
have
a
hard
time
accumul
an
oxygen
atmospher
in
particular
an
allocean
planet
may
have
a
hard
time
support
an
oxygen
atmospher
there
is
also
the
problem
of
whi
the
oxygen
in
the
earth
atmospher
ha
been
rel
stabl
over
geolog
time
for
a
period
at
least
order
of
magnitud
longer
than
the
decay
time
of
atmospher
o
to
weather
in
the
absenc
of
replenish
no
convinc
feedback
mechan
ha
been
identifi
perhap
the
reason
is
the
weak
anthrop
principl
if
dure
the
last
myr
or
so
the
oxygen
level
had
drop
too
low
we
wouldnt
be
here
to
be
wonder
about
it
