paul
quit
frankli
ill
believ
that
thi
is
realli
go
to
work
on
the
typic
trash
one
need
to
process
when
i
see
them
put
a
coupl
ton
in
one
end
and
get
rel
clean
materi
out
the
other
end
plu
be
abl
to
run
it
off
it
own
residu
power
sound
almost
like
perpetu
motion
doesnt
it
fred
the
honest
thing
to
do
would
be
to
admit
your
critic
on
scientif
ground
wa
invalid
rather
than
pretend
you
were
actual
talk
about
engin
feasibl
given
you
post
i
cant
say
i
am
surpris
though
well
pardon
me
for
tri
to
continu
the
discuss
rather
than
just
tug
my
forelock
in
dismay
at
have
not
consid
actual
tri
to
recov
the
energi
from
thi
process
which
is
at
least
tri
to
go
the
right
way
on
the
energi
curv
now
where
did
i
put
those
sackcloth
and
ash
i
wa
not
and
am
not
pretend
anyth
i
am
so
pleas
you
are
not
surpris
though
no
it
is
noth
like
perpetu
motion
note
that
i
didnt
say
it
wa
perpetu
motion
or
even
that
it
sound
like
perpetu
motion
the
phrase
wa
sound
almost
like
perpetu
motion
which
i
at
least
consid
a
somewhat
differ
propposit
than
the
one
you
elect
to
critic
perhap
i
should
beg
your
pardon
for
be
too
precis
in
my
use
of
languag
the
physic
is
well
understood
the
energi
come
from
fission
of
actinid
in
subcrit
assembl
folk
have
talk
about
spallat
reactor
sinc
the
s
puls
spallat
neutron
sourc
are
in
use
today
a
research
tool
acceler
design
ha
been
improv
particularli
with
superconduct
acceler
caviti
which
help
feasibl
lo
alamo
ha
expertis
in
high
current
acceler
lampf
so
i
believ
they
know
what
they
are
talk
about
i
will
believ
that
thi
process
come
even
close
to
approach
technolog
and
econom
feasibl
given
the
mix
natur
of
the
trash
that
will
have
to
be
run
through
it
a
oppos
to
the
cost
of
separ
thing
first
and
have
a
differ
run
for
each
actinid
when
i
see
them
dump
a
few
ton
in
one
end
and
pull
rel
clean
materi
out
the
other
onc
the
cost
technolog
risk
etc
are
taken
into
account
i
still
class
thi
one
with
the
idea
of
throw
wast
into
the
sun
sure
it
possibl
and
the
physic
are
well
understood
but
is
it
realli
a
reason
approach
and
i
still
wonder
at
what
sort
of
burn
rate
you
could
get
with
someth
like
thi
a
oppos
to
what
kind
of
energi
you
would
realli
recov
a
oppos
to
what
it
would
cost
to
build
and
power
with
and
without
the
energi
recoveri
are
we
talk
ounc
pound
or
ton
gram
kilogram
or
metric
ton
for
you
si
fan
of
materi
and
are
we
talk
day
week
month
or
year
day
week
month
or
year
for
you
si
fan
hmmm
still
use
a
nondecim
time
scale
i
see
the
real
reason
whi
acceler
breeder
or
inciner
are
not
be
built
is
that
there
isnt
ani
reason
to
do
so
natur
uranium
is
still
too
cheap
and
geolog
dispos
of
actinid
look
technic
reason
insist
on
perfect
safeti
is
for
peopl
who
dont
have
the
