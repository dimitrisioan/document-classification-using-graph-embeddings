the
limit
on
spacewalk
is
a
function
of
suit
suppli
mass
and
orbit
durat
in
order
to
perform
the
reboost
of
the
hst
the
om
engin
will
be
fire
for
a
long
period
now
the
shuttl
is
a
heavi
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
om
fuel
need
to
fli
both
up
is
substanti
a
small
booster
carri
up
and
use
to
boost
hst
on
it
own
will
weigh
significantli
le
then
the
om

requir
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttl
for
a
given
orbit
chang
from
what
i
understand
the
mass
margin
on
the
hst
mission
are
tight
enough
they
cant
even
carri
extra
suit
or
mmu

i
havent
seen
ani

on
the

i
cant

probabl
a

eva
equip
and
a
much
om

and
consum
a
they
can
thi
should
be
lighter
than
the
origin
hst
deploy
mission
which
achiev
the
highest
altitud
for
a
shuttl
mission
to
date
and
hst
is
now
in
a

seem
like
the
