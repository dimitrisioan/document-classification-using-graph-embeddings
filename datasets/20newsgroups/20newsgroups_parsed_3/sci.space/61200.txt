how
will

be

stow

then
return

actual
the
reboost
will
probabl
be
done
last
so
that
there
is
a
fuel
reserv
dure
the
eva
in
case
they
have
to
chase
down
an
adrift
astronaut
or
someth
like
that
but
ye
youv
got
the
idea
the
reboost
is
done
by
take
the
whole
shuttl
up
my
guess
is
whi
bother
with
usingth
shuttl
to
reboost
whi
not
grappl
do
all
said
fix
bolt
a
small
liquid
fuel
thruster
modul
to
hst
then
let
it
make
the
reboost
somebodi
ha
to
build
that
thruster
modul
it
not
an
offtheshelf
item
nor
is
it
a
trivial
piec
of
hardwar
sinc
it
ha
to
includ
attitud
control
hst
own
is
not
strong
enough
to
compens
for
thing
like
thruster
imbal
guidanc
there
is
no
provis
to
feed
gyro
data
from
hst
own
gyro
to
an
extern
devic
and
separ
you
dont
want
it
left
attach
afterward
if
onli
to
avoid
possibl
contamin
after
the
telescop
lid
is
open
again
you
also
get
to
worri
about
whether
the
lid
is
go
to
open
after
the
reboost
is
done
and
hst
is
inaccess
to
the
shuttl
the
lid
stay
close
for
the
durat
of
all
of
thi
to
prevent
mirror
contamin
from
thruster
and
the
like
the
origin
plan
wa
to
use
the
orbit
maneuv
vehicl
to
do
the
reboost
the
omv
wa
plan
to
be
a

thi
sort
of

unfortun
it
