the
problem
with
oort
cloud
sourc
is
that
absolut
no
plausibl
mechan
ha
been
propos
it
would
have
to
involv
new
physic
a
far
a
i
can
tell
closest
to
convent
oort
sourc
is
a
model
of
bfield
pinch
by
comet
it
got
too
mani
hole
in
it
to
count
but
at
least
it
wa
a
good
tri
so
you
have
a
plausibl
model
for
grb
at
astronom
distanc
i
dont
have
ani
plausibl
model
for
grb
at
ani
distanc
recent
observ
have
just
about
rule
out
the
merg
neutron
star
hypothesi
which
had
a
lot
of
problem
anyhow
we
have
to
look
for
implaus
model
and
what
is
fundament
allow
independ
of
model
hmm
the
superbowl
burst
ha
been
claim
in
press
releas
to
cast
doubt
on
the
merg
n
hypothesi
from
what
ive
read
and
i
havent
seen
the
paper
onli
the
press
id
say
it
is
consist
with
some
of
the
merg
n
model
a
paper
on
the
possibl
of
grb
in
the
oort
cloud
just
came
through
the
astrophys
abstract
servic
to
get
a
copi
of
thi
here
is
the
abstract
of
that
paper
indic
to
these
event
all
possibl
sourc
which
are
isotrop
distribut
should
remain
under
consider
thi
is
whi
the
oort
cloud
of
comet
is
kept
on
the
list
although
there
is
no
known
mechan
for
gener
grb
from
cometari
nucleu
unlik
a
it
may
seem
the
possibl
that
grb
origin
in
the
solar
cometari
cloud
can
not
be
exclud
until
it
is
disprov
thi
doe
not
propos
a
mechan
for
grb
in
the
oort
and
no
antimatt
annihil
doe
not
fit
the
spectrum
at
least
a
far
a
i
understand
annihil
spectrum
big
differ
that
ignor
the
question
of
how
you
fit
a
distribut
to
the
oort
distribut
when
the
oort
distribut
is
not
well
known
in
particular
comet
aphelion
which
are
not
well
known
are
not
a
good
