get
wierd
again
okay
we
have
figur
out
that
a
mission
specif
to
pluto
is
to
larg
and
to
expens
okay
what
about
launch
one
probe
with
multipl
part
kind
of
liek
the
old
mirv
principl
of
old
cold
war
day
basic
what
i
mean
is
design
a
mother
ship
that
ha
piggi
back
probe
for
differ
missionsnam
differ
planet
each
probe
would
be
tie
in
with
the
mother
ship
or
earth
a
the
case
may
be
thi
is
good
when
and
if
we
go
for
mar
the
mar
mission
can
act
a
either
mother
ship
or
relay
point
for
the
probe
also
the
mother
ship
would
be
power
if
not
the
mar
mission
by
a
normal
propuls
but
also
a
solar
sail
main
reason
for
solar
sail
race
is
to
see
what
can
be
done
and
autmoat
the
sail
would
get
the
probe
to
were
they
need
i
know
the
asteroidmeteor
cloud
and
such
might
get
in
the
way
of
a
sail
main
reasonf
ro
mother
ship
idea
is
to
make
it
more
economo
to
send
multipl
probesmissionsatellitesexplorer
to
differ
place
and
cut
cost
the
probe
could
do
