write
if
reboost
the
hst
by
carri
it
with
a
shuttl
would
not
damag
it
then
whi
couldnt
hst
be
brought
back
to
earth
and
the
repair
job
done
here
is
it
becaus
two
shuttl
flight
would
be
requir
ad
to
the
alredi
horrend
expens
i
dont
think
a
reboost
exercis
is
analog
to
a
shuttl
landinglaunch
in

of
stressesmisalignmentsetc
i
would
think
of
the
reboost
a
a
gentil
push
where
a
land
then
launch
a
two
jolt
which
would
put
more
mechan
stress
on
the
instrument
addit
there
might
be
a
concern
about
land
load
to
the
shuttl
in
the
event
of
a
laden
land
final
probabl
some
thought
went
into
possibl
contamin
problem
if
the
instrument
came
back
to
earth
of
cours
the
cost
of
two
shuttl
launch
is
a
good
reason
to
avoid
someth
that
might
be
done
in
one
shuttl
launch
here
hope
cepi
gang
get
the
job
done
right
the
first
time
