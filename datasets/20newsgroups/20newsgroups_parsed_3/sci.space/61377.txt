burster
posit
stuff
in
articl
write
actual
my
advisor
anoth
classmat
of
mine
and
me
were
talk
the
other
day
about
put
just
one
detector
on
one
of
the
pluto
satellit
then
we
realiz
that
the
satellit
alon
is
onli
carri
someth
like
pound
of
eq
well
a
bat
detector
need
lead
shield
to
protect
it
and
alon
weigh
about
pound
itself
actual
the
situat
is
even
wors
than
that
the
total
mass
of
the
pluto
fast
flybi
spacecraft
is
onli
ish
pound
and
most
of
that
is
support
equip
like
power
and
commun
the
mass
avail
for
instrument
is
mayb
of
that
i
dont
think
a
bat
will
fit
actual
would
you
need
the
shield
my
understand
is
that
it
mostli
there
to
give
the
detector
some
direction
no
point
in
do
that
if
youv
onli
got
one
im
sure
the
burst
detector
that
have
flown
on
other
deepspac
mission
havent
weigh
that
much
mind
you
theyr
probabl
still
too
heavi
the
pff
peopl
would
put
more
plutospecif
instrument
on
first
if
they
had
ani
mass
to
spare
