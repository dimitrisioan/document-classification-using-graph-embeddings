pat
write
in
articl
greg
moor
write
a
herni
point
out
you
have
to
develop
the
thruster
also
while
much
lighter
you
still
have
to
lift
the
mass
of
the
thruster
to
orbit
and
then
the
thruster
lift
it
own
weight
into
a
higher
orbit
and
you
take
up
room
in
the
payload
bay
a
ye
but
the
improv
in
boost
orbit
to
the
hst
is
signific
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
say
here
what
is
improv
what
is
signific
and
what
doe
thi
have
to
do
with
carri
more
equip
on
a
servic
mission
also
a
impli
by
other
poster
whi
do
you
need
to
boost
the
orbit
on
thi
mission
anyway
mayb
you
have
someth
here
but
could
you
pleas
clarifi
it
for
u
on
the
net
right
now
the
hst
sevic
mission
is
list
a
day
befor
it
wa
list
a
day
they
just
kick
up
the
number
of
spacewalk
to
after
simul
indic
that
it
wa
not
doabl
in
after
all
the
space
walk
they
are
go
to
reboost
the
hst
orbit
i
think
right
now
it
sit
at
mile
up
they
would
like
i
dont
know
the
exact
orbit
number
i
know
when
hst
wa
first
flown
it
wa
place
in
the
highest
possibl
shuttl
orbit
now
the
shuttl
can
cari
a
thing
call
the
edo
pallet
or
extend
durat
orbit
pallet
it
mostli
loxlh
for
the
fuel
cell
and
rc
gear
plu
more
o
and
canist
for
the
life
support
rebreath
mayb
more
nitrogen
too
the
limit
on
spacewalk
is
a
function
of
suit
suppli
mass
and
orbit
durat
in
order
to
perform
the
reboost
of
the
hst
the
om
engin
will
be
fire
for
a
long
period
now
the
shuttl
is
a
heavi
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
om
fuel
need
to
fli
both
up
is
substanti
a
small
booster
carri
up
and
use
to
boost
hst
on
it
own
will
weigh
significantli
le
then
the
om
fuel
requir
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttl
for
a
given
orbit
chang
from
what
i
understand
the
mass
margin
on
the
hst
mission
are
tight
enough
they
cant
even
carri
extra
suit
or
mmu
now
if
they
use
a
small
tug
i
would
bet
just
a
wild
guess
that
the
save
on
am
margin
would
allow
carri
the
edo
pallet
extra
suit
more
consum
part
for
the
flaki
fg
sensor
part
for
the
balki
solar
electron
and
still
enough
for
a
doubl
magnum
of
champagn
or
the
hst
could
even
get
place
into
some
sort
of
medium
orbit
the
reason
they
want
a
high
orbit
is
le
antenna
point
and
longer
drag
life
and
that
mean
you
can
then
carri
edo
pack
and
enough
consum
so
the
shuttl
mission
can
go
on
long
enough
to
also
fix
the
array
tilt
motor
and
god
know
what
els
is
go
to
wear
out
from
what
ive
heard
the
motor
are
fine
it
is
one
of
the
two
set
of
electron
that
control
the
motor
that
need
a
fix
the
motor
and
electron
are
separ
piec
of
hardwar
i
expect
to
be
correct
if
im
wrong
on
thi
a
whatev
it
is
the
problem
in
the
tilt
array
is
a
big
constraint
on
hst
op
pat
