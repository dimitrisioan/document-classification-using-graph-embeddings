but
tri
to
land
a
shuttl
with
that
big
huge
telescop
in
the
back
and
you
could
have
problem
the
shuttl
just
isnt
design
to
land
with
that
much
weight
in
the
payload
is
hst
realli
that
much
heavier
than
a
spacelab
i
cant
speak
to
sheer
mass
but
part
of
the
problem
is
that
hst
wasnt
built
to
ever
be
brought
back
down
it
not
built
for
those
kind
of
jolt
forc
and
there
is
no
support
cradl
for
it
which
is
addit
weight
that
would
be
requir
just
to
throw
it
out
there
the
mass
of
the
telescop
is
kg
lb
i
do
not
know
what
space
lab
weigh
but
i
believ
it
is
le
can
anyon
verifi
also
rememb
that
weight
wa
not
the
onli
concern
a
mani
other
have
note
just
one
possibl
concern
i
wa
respond
to
a
statement
that
if
you
can
boost
it
whi
cant
you
land
it
those
are
too
differ
