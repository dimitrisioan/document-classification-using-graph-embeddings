pat
write
no
the
thing
is
design
to
be
retriev
in
a
pinch
inde
thi
dictat
a
rather
odd
design
for
the
solar
array
sinc
they
had
to
be
retract
a
well
a
extend
whi
not
design
the
solar
array
to
be
detach
if
the
shuttl
is
go
to
retunr
the
hst
what
bother
are
some
array
they
can
be
detach
in
an
emerg
but
expens
hardwar
is
not
thrown
away
casual
bear
in
mind
that
nobodi
knew
the
design
wa
defect
if
the
deploy
crew
had
found
some
nasti
flaw
the
lid
fail
to
open
for
exampl
it
would
have
been
a
bit
embarrass
to
have
to
throw
the
solar
array
away
to
get
the
thing
back
in
the
payload
bay
i
guess
it
kind
of
an
aesthet
argument
i
can
see
the
solar
array
be
expens
and
there
could
be
conting
where
you
would
be
throw
away
brand
new
solar
cell
but
it
seem
so
cheap
compar
toa
shuttl
mission
i
wouldnt
think
they
would
bother
pat
