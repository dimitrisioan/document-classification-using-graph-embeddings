re
gamma
ray
burster
where
are
they
i
feel
compel
to
complain
the
statement
that
recent
observ
rule
out
merg
neutron
star
a
sourc
of
gammaray
burst
is
utterli
fals
even
though
it
is
popular
enough
to
make
it
to
bats
press
releas
the
idea
behind
the
statement
is
a
follow
if
you
smack
two
neutron
star
togeth
or
have
a
neutron
star
be
gobbl
up
by
a
black
hole
a
lot
of
energi
is
releas
enough
for
a
gammaray
burst
at
a
cosmolog
distanc
but
so
the
reason
continu
thi
energi
is
releas
below
a
lot
of
matter
so
the
radiat
becom
thermal
and
you
expect
to
see
roughli
a
blackbodi
spectrum
the
observ
spectrum
are
strongli
nontherm
so
thi
model
must
be
wrong
a
so
often
the
fault
lie
with
the
imagin
of
the
person
who
wa
tri
to
prove
the
model
wrong
rather
than
with
the
model
it
may
be
that
the
initi
energi
releas
is
not
seen
a
a
gammaray
burst
but
the
firebal
of
energi
and
matter
that
is
creat
may
spew
out
a
relativist
flow
when
thi
slam
into
the
surround
medium
a
strong
flux
of
nontherm
gamma
ray
result
which
may
carri
off
a
substanti
fraction
of
the
initi
total
energi
all
thi
is
not
my
idea
it
is
in
a
seri
of
paper
by
martin
ree
peter
meszaro
sorri
for
the
miss
accent
and
cowork
it
is
certainli
not
a
complet
model
but
it
may
well
be
the
best
one
around
sum
over
all
propos
distanc
scale
an
altern
propos
for
what
creat
the
initi
firebal
by
the
way
is
the
socal
fail
supernova
scenario
by
stan
woosley
in
which
a
veri
massiv
star
at
the
end
of
it
life
collaps
to
a
black
hole
if
the
stellar
core
wa
rotat
part
of
the
infal
matter
will
be
temporarili
halt
becaus
it
is
support
by
centrifug
forc
and
form
a
veri
dens
neutron
toru
that
accret
onto
the
black
hole
thi
beast
may
spew
out
a
jet
along
the
rotat
axi
which
again
constitut
relativist
flow
the
rate
of
such
event
may
be
much
higher
than
that
of
neutron
star
merger
but
the
flux
may
be
more
strongli
beam
so
that
the
net
rate
of
burst
observ
on
earth
stay
the
same
between
the
two
scenario
but
the
energi
releas
per
event
can
be
a
lot
le
in
the
fail
supernova
scenario
on
anoth
note
i
do
believ
that
the
distanc
scale
must
ultim
be
resolv
via
some
classic
astronom
method
such
a
find
counterpart
to
the
burst
at
other
wavelength
or
find
a
definit
signatur
of
some
known
class
of
object
in
the
distribut
of
posit
and
flux
theorist
have
histor
not
been
too
successful
in
find
the
distanc
of
ani
object
by
prove
that
there
is
onli
one
possibl
way
in
which
the
object
can
work
and
therefor
it
must
be
