do
spacecraft
have
to

whi
couldnt
magellan
just
be
told
to
go
into
a
safe
mode
and
stay
bob
about
venu
in
a
lowpowerus
mode
and
if
mayb
in
a
few
year
if
fund
get
restor
after
the
economi
get
better
hope
it
could
be
turn
on
again
it
can
be
but
the
problem
is
a
polit
one
not
a
technic
one
also
rememb
that
everi
dollar
spent
keep
one
spacecraft
in
safe
mode
probabl
a
spinstabil
sunpoint
orient
is
a
dollar
not
spent
on
mission
analysi
for
a
newer
spacecraft
in
order
to
turn
the
spacecraft
back
on
you
either
need
to
insur
that
the
op
guy
will
be
avail
or
you
need
to
retrain
a
new
team
have
said
that
there
are
some
spacecraft
that
do
what
you
have
propos
mani
of
the
oper
satellit
goddard
fli
like
the
tiro
noaa
seri
requir
more
than
one
satellit
in
orbit
for
an
oper
set
extra
which
get
replac
onorbit
are
power
into
a
standbi
mode
for
use
in
an
emerg
in
that
case
howev
the
same
op
team
is
still
requir
to
fli
the
oper
bird
so
the
standbi
mainten
is
rel
cheap
final
pat
explan
some
spacecraft
requir
continu
mainten
to
stay
under
control
is
also
right
on
the
mark
i
suggest
a
spin
stabil
control
mode
becaus
it
would
requir
littl
power
or
mainten
but
it
still
might
requir
some
momentum
dump
from
time
to
time
in
the
end
it
is
a
polit
decis
sinc
the
differ
is
money
but
there
is
some
technic
rational
behind
the
decis
