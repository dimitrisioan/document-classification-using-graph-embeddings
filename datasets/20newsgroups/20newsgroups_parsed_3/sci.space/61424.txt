re
hst
servic
mission
schedul
for
day
regard
the
feasabl
of
retriev
the
hst
for
repair
and
relaunch
it
caution
specul
mode
engag
there
is
anoth
consider
that
hasnt
been
mention
yet
i
expect
that
retriev
hst
would
involv
damag
it
consider
in
order
to
return
it
to
it
cradl
in
the
cargo
bay
most
of
the
deploy
item
antenna
and
especi
the
solar
aray
probabl
are
not
retract
into
their
fulli
stow
posit
even
by
hand
they
would
have
to
be
remov
by
the
astronaut
the
onli
advantag
that
thi
might
yield
is
that
we
could
put
new
panel
on
that
dont
ring
due
to
thermal
cycl
stress
i
also
expect
that
a
ha
been
discus
the
land
load
on
the
hst
optic
structur
is
a
big
issu
but
that
the
reentri
load
are
much

so
can
the

even
be

assum
that
