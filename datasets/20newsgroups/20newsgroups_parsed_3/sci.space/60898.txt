system
softwar
thing
are
check
that
dont
have
the
right
valu
in
yet
becaus
they
arent
set
till
after
launch
and
suchlik
rather
than
fix
the
code
and
possibl
introduc
new
bug
they
just
tell
the
crew
ok
if
you
see
a

befor
liftoff
ignor
it
good
grief
and
i
thought
the
shuttl

known
for
be
wellengin
if
thi
is
actual
the
