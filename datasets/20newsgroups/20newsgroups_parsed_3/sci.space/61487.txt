that
too
is
a
poor
choic
of
word
someon

think
im
push
a
gay
agenda

thi
by
rephras
it
a
an
extrem
i
a
a
minor
of
one
have
no
right
to
a
beauti
world
you
on
the
other
hand
have
the
right
to
make
an
ugli
one
becaus
you
presum
to
speak
for
all
the
rest
and
i
can
not
complain
curiou
i
say
what
im
object
to
here
is
a
float
billboard
that
presum
would
move
around
in
the
sky
i
for
one
am
against
legisl
at
all
i
just
wish
that
peopl
had
a
bit
of
common
courtesi
and
would
consid
how
their
greed
for
money
impact
the
more
ether
and
aesthet
valu
that
make
u
human
thi
includ
the
need
for
wild
and
unspoil
thing
includ
the
night
sky
oh
i
see
you
dont
want
ani
legisl
that
might
imping
on
you
you
just
want
everyon
els
on
the
planet
to
do
what
you
want
and
do
you
want
everyon
to
do
a
you
wish
insist
on
put
someth
up
that
will
impact
everyon
for
selfish
reason
without
ani
legisl
and
no
one
els
can
even
object
somehow
i
think
thi
whole
shove
contest
ha
gotten
way
off
the
track
im
readi
to
let
thi
thread
die
a
quick
and
merci
death
insist
on
perfect
safeti
is
for

who
dont
have
the
ball
