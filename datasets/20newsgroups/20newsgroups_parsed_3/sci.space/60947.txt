the
solar

is
a
wellestablish
concept
har
the
pressur
of
sunlight
a
spacecraft
would
have
unlimit
rang
in
principl
such
a
vehicl
could
explor
the
whole
solar
system
with
zero
fuel
consumpt
howev
it
is
more
difficult
to
design
a
practic
solar
sail
than
most
peopl
realiz
the
pressur

is
onli
about

deploy

the

the

the
total

of

the

would
