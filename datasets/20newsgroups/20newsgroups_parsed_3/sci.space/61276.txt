not
come
from

strictli

consider

some
of
what

reader
may
never
have
known
a
time
where
the
heaven
were
pristin
sacr
unsulli
by
the
action
of
human
the
space
between
the
star
a
profoundli
black
a
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizon
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
ani
connect
with
the
petti
matter
of
man
ani
light
were
suppli
sole
by
natur
uncorrupt
by
men
whole
religion
were
base
on
mortal
man
somehow
get
up
there
and
becom
immort
a

whether
by
apotheosi
or
a
belief
in
an
afterlif
the
space
age
chang
all
that
more
on
man
effect
on
the

but
there
is
still
thi
desir
to
see
a
place
that
man
hasnt
foul
in
some
way
i
think
my
point
about
a
desir
for
beauti
is
valid
even
if
it
cant
ever
be
perfectli
achiev
i
agre
that
the
desir
for
beauti
is
valid
but
i
think
your
desir
to
impos
your
vision
of
beauti
is
not
you
mention
the
ageold
desir
to
somehow
get
up
there
but
ignor
the
beauti
of
the
actual
achiev
of
that
vision
you
mention
the
beauti
of
a
veri
dark
sky
not
imped
by
the
effect
of
human
but
ignor
the
beauti
of
the
asdarkascanb
sky
that
is
onli
visibl
from
space
a
vision
that
we
or
at
least
our
descend
may
one
day
be
abl
to
see
in
part
becaus
of
effort
that
other
call
ugli
one
day
i
hope
human
will
be
abl
to
look
out
not
upon
half
the
heaven
with
onli
naturecret
light
but
upon
all
of
the
heaven
with
no
light
if
advertis
in
space
can
help
u
reach
that
goal
it
is
no
le
beauti
for
the
way
we
reach
it
than
the
pristin
sky
of
yesteryear
or
yestercenturi
which
is
total
unreach
one
of
the
origin
concept
of
beauti
in
wetsern
sculptur
wa
a
human
form
in
the
effort
of
strive
to
reach
a
goal
i
dont
think
there
ani
reason
to
believ
that
modern
ha
chang
that
just
becaus
it

btw
there
are
