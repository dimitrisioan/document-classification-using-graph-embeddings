whi

no

just
for

hydraul
also
allow
a

to
produc

with
weak

use
the
principl
of
a
hydraul
jack
rather
than
a

thi
is
one
of
those
ye
but
thing
it
true
that
a
hydraul
pressur
tube
can
be
somewhat
more
rigid
than
an
unpressur
tube
but
even
at
psi
level
a
hydraul
hose
will
bend
rather
easili
though
it

a

increas
it
interest
to
note
that
on
land
creatur
are
either
two
leg
or
leg
with
tini
insect
have
or
leg
but
never
leg
though
that
would
be
a
stabl
configur
it
can
be
argu
that
leg
creatur
kangaroo
are
leg
the
specif
number
of
limb
a
creatur
ha
is
an
accid
of
evolut
it
is
hard
to
make
chang
in
some
structur
the
panda
ha
a
thumb
plu
a
mani
finger
a
it
ancestor
five
on
each
hand
but
the
thumb
is
a
modifi
wristbon
rather
than
a
modifi
finger
and
extra
finger
are
much
more
common
than
extra
limb
especi
fullyfunct
one
kangaroo
limb
i
dont
think
so
if
you
take
the
view
that
the
tail
is
a
limb
then
monkey
and
kangaroo
are
limb
i
think
the
tail
is
a
differ
kind
of
structur
grossli
enlarg
in
the
case
of
the
kangaroo
but
primarili
still
an
instrument
of
balanc
rather
than
locomot
i
dont
know
much
about
panda
thumb
so
ill
ask
is
it
oppos
thermodynam
consider
of
surfacevolum
relationship
would
seem
to
dictat
that
activ
complex
creatur
stay
in
a
size
rang
similar
to
what
we
see
about
u
inch
tall
intellig
alien
seem
unlik
a
do
those
much
larger
than
the
eleph
whi
cant
a
lemur
or
a
brontosauru
be
intellig
ye
i
know
that
the
brontosauru
is
a
mythic
beast
produc
by
put
the
head
of
anoth
dinosaur
on
an
apatosauru
but
so
far
space
alien
are
also
mythic
well
i
wont
say
flat
out
that
they
cant
be
intellig
but
ill
bring
a
coupl
of
line
of
argument
to
bear
to
tri
to
show
whi
i
dont
think
it
like
first
let
me
say
that
when
i
say
intellig
i
mean
complex
behavior
in
respons
to
novel
situat
on
a
level
with
or
greater
than
human
tool
use
and
tool
build
ie
assum
suitabl
manipul
are
present
on
the
creatur
to
allow
it
to
alter
it
enviro
in
a
plan
way
it
will
do
so
that
certainli
not
a
univers
or
complet
definit
of
intellig
but
it
will
suffic
for
a
put
technolog
alien
now
no
one
know
exactli
what
make
a
brain
capabl
of
thought
but
it
gener
accept
that
one
of
the
criterion
is
a
certain
level
of
complex
thi
is
gener
determin
by
the
number
of
neuron
cell
and
their
interconnect
so
a
creatur
the
size
of
a
lemur
wouldnt
have
enough
neuron
to
support
complex
thought
thi
argument
is
consider
le
clear
in
the
case
of
the
dinosaur
there
room
for
a
larg
brain
though
no
indic
that
one
ever
develop
one
reason
thi
may
be
true
is
neuron
speed
the
electrochem
messag
that
trigger
neuron
requir
time
to
propag
thi
make
it
difficult
for
a
highli
complex
central
brain
to
coordin
the
movement
of
veri
larg
creatur
so
there
littl
select
pressur
for
such
brain
instead
a
simpler
distribut
network
evolv
thi
doesnt
rule
out
intellig
dinosaur
but
it
point
in
that
direct
then
there
are
the
thermodynam
argument
a
tini
creatur
like
the
lemur
need
to
eat
frequent
becaus
it
intern
heat
is
rapidli
lost
due
to
it
high
surfac
to
volum
ratio
i
contend
that
a
creatur
that
must
spend
most
of
it
time
and
energi
feed
wont
have
the
time
to
develop
and
exercis
intellig
that
argument
may
be
somewhat
weak
the
dinosaur
problem
is
the
revers
it
must
moder
it
heat
product
becaus
it
high
volum
to
surfac
ratio
make
it
tend
to
retain
wast
heat
im
assum
that
a
certain
temperatur
rang
is
optim
for
chemic
reactiv
reason
for
product
neuron
function
so
creatur
would
tend
to
need
to
maintain
a
regul
temperatur
in
a

near
that
of
human
if
they
are
carbon
base
that
tend
to
rule
out
cold
blood
creatur
a
potenti
home
of
intellig
some
peopl
contend
that
some
of
the
dinosaur
may
have
been
warm
blood
but
for
a
creatur
the
size
of
a
brontosaur
it
activ
level
would
have
to
be
restrain
or
it
would
be
prone

an

explos
from

whale
are
similar
size
but
they
can
reject
heat
to
the
ocean
a
much
more
effici
sink
than

i
suspect
that
for
intellig
to
manifest
itself
a
certain
degre
of
activ
in

with

is
