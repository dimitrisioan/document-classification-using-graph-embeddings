i
wa
suggest
that

let
me
give
you
an
exampl
when

tv
they
have
commerci
to
pay
for
the
program
you
accept
that
a
part
of
watch
if
you
dont
like
it
you
can
turn
it
off
if
you
want
to
view
the
night
sky
and
there
is
a
float
billboard
out
there
you
cant
turn
it
off
it
the
same
reason
that
limit
billboard
in
scenic
area
and
if
you
want
to
view
that
televis
station
you
have
to
watch
the
commerci
you
cant
turn
them
off

the
televis
station
in
other
word
if
you
dont
like

can
think
of
that

have
to
forc
other
peopl

conform
to
your
idea
of
aesthet
behaviour
what
next
law
regul
how

the
theori
of
govern
here
is
that
the
major
rule
except
in

natur
of
fundament
civil

say
ani
reason
indepth
perus
of

show
you
that
mani
wasp
have
continu
the
practic
of
prejudic
discrimin
and
violenc
against

despit
the
law
which
ha
what
to
do
with
the
topic
of
discuss
pat
say
if
you
realli
are
annoy
get
some
legisl
to
creat
a
dark
sky
zone
where
in
all
light
emiss
are
protect
in

kind
of
like

includ
the
need
for
