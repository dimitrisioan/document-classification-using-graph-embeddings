survivor
claim
he
heard
someon
shout
the
fire
start
odd
terminolog
that
what
one
say
when
you
know
a
fire
is
plan
not
when
one
occur
by
accid
it
also
what
you
say
when
your
wait
for
the
end
to
come
in
a
fieri
apocalypsejust
a
thought
person
if
the
fire
wa
set
by
either
side
i
wonder
about
the
time
if
koresh
co
set
the
fire
whi
wait
through
six
hour
of
wallbash
and
teargas
befor
start
wa
there
anyth
new
that
happen
just
around
that
point
similarli
if
the
fbi
were
go
to
torch
the
place
and
fake
it
of
cours
whi
wait
so
long
wouldnt
it
be
more
reason
to
believ
the
bd
would
set
the
fire
earli
after
the
assault
began
the
most
plausibl
to
me
explain
is
that
of
an
accident
start
of
the
fire
by
the
tank
among
other
thing
i
say
that
becaus
i
wa
listen
to
the
radio
when
the
fire
start
and
the
report
watch
from
a
distanc
of
cours
said
that
it
look
like
at
least
one
of
the
tank
had
penetr
farther
into
the
build
than
previous
specif
he
said
that
one
tank
appar
wa
halfway
half
of
the
tank
lenght
into
the
build
where
it
previous
had
onli
been
penetr
