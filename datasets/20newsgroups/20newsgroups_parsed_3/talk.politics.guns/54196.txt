what
you
said
wa
that
we
had
spent
money
on
gun
rather
than
peopl
a
canada
doe
which
is
ridicul
onc
again
i
have
over
estim
the
gener
level
of
intelleg
of
the

reader
of
rushlimbaugh
canada
per
caput
spend
more
money
on
peopl
where
the
u
spend
more
money
per
caput
on
gun
what
exactli
do
you
mean
when
you
say
the
u
spend
more
per
caput
on
gun
than
canada
doe
are
you
talk
about
the
u
govern
or
are
you
talk
about
the
purchas
of
gun
by
privat
citizen
or
both
if
you
are
refer
to
privat
citizen
then
your
point
is
irrevel
becaus
what
individu
do
with
their
money
is
essenti
their
busi
if
on
the
other
hand
you
meant
that
the
u
govern
spend
more
per
caput
on
gun
than
canada
doe
then
your
point
is
relev
so
if
thi
is
true
then
the
u
need
to
get
it
prioriti
straight
peopl
are
more
import
than
gun
that
is
not
to
say
that
gun
arent
import
im
just
say
that
if
the
u
govern
doe
spend
more
per
caput
on
gun
than
they
do
on
peopl
then
someth
is
awri
he
meant
the
u
spend
more
per
caput
on
gun
than
canada
which
isnt
realli
surpris
becaus
we
were
so
busi
protect
the
western
world
from
the
ussr
that
all
other
countri
could
slack
off
on
their
defens
spend
i
would
like
to
see
if
the
u
spend
more
per

on
peopl
than
canada
doe
thi
is
