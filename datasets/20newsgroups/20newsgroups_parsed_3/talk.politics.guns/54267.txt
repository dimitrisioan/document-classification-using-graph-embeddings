american
express
card

two
question
when
wa
thi
and
do

the
relev
number
plea
note
thi
is
not
in
ani
way
an
indic
i
dont
believ
you
or
that
your
not
correct
but
when
the
drop
occur
is
relev
acquir
weapon
in
norway
you
can
buy
almost
all
kind
of
weapon
in
norway
but
you
must
have
a
permit
and
a
good
reason
to
get
the
permit
if
i
would
like
to
have
a
handgun
i
would
have
to
get
an
gunlic
from
the
polic
and
to
be
a
member
of
a
gunclub
the
primari
object
beyond
one
base
on
the
ideal
of
rkba
that
it
is
simpli
not
someth
the
govern
should
do
is
that
it
make
gun
a
playth
and
tool
of
the
rich
and
connect
it
discrimin
against
the
poor
is
selfdefens
consid
appropri
and
if
so
under
what
condit
are
you
allow
for
instanc
to
get
a
gun
for
protect
if
your
go
to
be
carri
a
veri
larg
sum
of
money
on
a
regular
basi
or
have
been
threaten
the
polic
would
check
my
crimin
record
for
ani
seriou
crime
andor
record
of
seriou
mental
diseas
thi
ha
been
suggest
in
the
u
and
gener
support
among
gun
owner
what
mani
object
to
is
that
mani
if
not
most
propos
contain
a
sort
of
gotcha
claus
which
allow
an
arbitrari
denial
even
if
you
qualifi
in
everi
way
now
if
a
got
my
licenc
i
would
have
to
be
an
activ
member
of
the
gun
club
for
month
befor
i
could
collect
my
gun
it
a
littl
like
get
a
driver
licenc
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
befor
you
are
allow
to
at
thi
point
it
should
be
point
out
that
in
gener
a
driver
licenc
in
the
u
is
for
the
most
part
noth
like
it
european
counterpart
i
understand
get
one
is
far
more
difficult
there
than
here
in
the
u
it
a
joke
but
my
usual
object
is
that
your
discus
two
differ
thing
for
instanc
in
the
u
a
driver
licens
is
a
permit
to
oper
a
motor
vehicl
on
a
public
road
it
is
not
necessari
to
own
one
or
to
oper
it
on
privat
properti
that
is
the
abil
to
requir
drive
permit
is
gener
consid
to
aris
from
the
govern
legitim
power
to
enact
reason
regul
for
behavior
on
public
land
a
permit
to
own
an
automobil
for
instanc
which
is
far
closer
an
analog
would
be
a
much
harder
thing
to
get
past
legal
sinc
it
wouldnt
be
base
on
make
regul
on
public
properti
but
in
restrict
activ
on
privat
properti
use
of
gun
in
crime
in
norway
some
crime
are
commit
with
gun
that
have
been
in
the
owner
arm
for
a
long
time
but
these
are
rather
the
exept
most
crimin
accuir
gun
to
use
them
in
crime
and
mostli
short
time
befor
the
crime
use
of
knive
it
is
allow
to
cari
knife
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
american
think
it
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carri
it
open
in
public
rigth
thi
vari
wide
one
thing
i
think
european
have
a
difficult
time
with
is
that
the
u
ha
fifti
uniqu
jurisdict
where
the
law
from
one
state
to
anoth
can
be
a
radic
differ
a
from
one
countri
in
europ
to
anoth
some
place
allow
open
carri
of
both
gun
and
knive
some
allow
conceal
some
prohibit
both
or
allow
one
or
the
other
and
it
can
be
either
a
state
or
local
restriciton
individu
v
mass
ye
the
individu
is
more
import
than
the
mass
but
onli
to
some
extent
your
crimin
law
are
to
protect
the
individu
who
make
the
mass
what
happen
when
the
rigth
of
some
individu
affect
the
right
of
all
the
other
the
question
must
be
ask
is
the
right
of
thi
individu
affect
the
right
of
thi
other
individu
what
we
usual
get
is
that
the
right
of
thi
group
mean
some
individu
within
thi
group
here
defin
a
peopl
who
own
gun
are
advers
affect
the
right
of
some
other
group
if
for
instanc
bob
were
use
hi
gun
to
attack
steve
youd
have
a
point
but
essenti
what
were
discus
is
that
becuas
some
person
who
qualifi
a
a
member
of
the
group
peopl
who
own
gun
then
some
third
person
perhap
in
anoth
time
zone
is
told
that
their
be
a
member
of
that
group
is
take
away
somebodi
el
right
it
like
tri
to
punish
all
newspap
for
the
libel
commit
by
one
the
issu
i
believ
the
issu
is
gun
and
gunlegisl
the
issu
is
crime
violenc
and
murder
the
question
is
to
what
extent
gun
and
gun
legisl
impact
those
we
shouldnt
mix
weapon
and
item
that
can
serv
a
one
if
i
live
in
amerika
i
would
probabl
have
a
gun
to
defend
myself
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
of
cours
not
it
would
be
nice
if
we
didnt
have
to
fear
that
other
peopl
might
get
it
into
their
twist
littl
mind
to
hurt
u
but
current
we
dont
have
that
option
nor
do
i
expect
we
will
do
you
think
it
wise
to
sell
gun
like
candi
some
state
do
no
state
doe
in
ani
case
there
a
limit
to
which
the
state
may
enforc
it
wisdom
on
me
freedom
in
gener
is
an
unwis
concept
if
you
preemptiv
restrict
everyth
which
might
be
unwis
then
freedom
becom
a
meaningless
concept
if
you
believ
it
smartneccaceri
to
have
driverslic
whi
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
gun
ill
rais
my
hand
against

licens
a
current

theyr
a
wast
of
time
and
littl
more
than
revanu
gener
for
the
state
and
ignor
by
a
startl
number
of

it
doe
not
guarante
a
level
of
skill
ani
higher
than
is
necessari
to
get
your
car
on

road
and
get
yourself
