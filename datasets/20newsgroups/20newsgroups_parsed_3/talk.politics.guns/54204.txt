frank
crari
say
i
have
never
seen
anyon
els
practic
marksmanship
by
take
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
a
fast
a
possibl
and
start
shoot
that
is
the
recommend
way
to
practic
with
a
ccw
too
aim
alon
is
no
d
goo
for
defens
if
you
cant
get
the
gun
rapidli
veri
true
but
the
way
it
wa
be
done
wa
just
a
littl
unusu
it
look
to
me
like
they
were
practic
to
shoot
someon
the
point
that
i
forgot
to
bring
up
here
and
thi
ha
noth
to
do
with
be
a
gang
member
or
not
is
that
it
is
illeg
to
carri
a
conceal
weapon
in
thi
area
or
in
the
state
of
illinoi
for
that
matter
thi
is
not
to
say
that
peopl
in
illinoi
dont
carri
conceal
weapon
illegali
but
practic
like
that
when
there
are
other
peopl
around
wasnt
too
bright
of
an
idea
there
isnt
necessarili
a
conflict
between
practic
with
a
conceal
weapon
for
selfdef
and
practic
to
shoot
someon
arm
selfdef
doe
occasion
involv
shoot
an

agre
if
you
dont
practic
at
all
and
carri
a
gun
for
selfdefens
