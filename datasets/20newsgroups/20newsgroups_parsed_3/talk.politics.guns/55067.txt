about
british
cult
member
delet
what
exactli
are
you
tri
to
say
and
whi
were
there
no
fireengin
within
a
mile
of
the
compound
becaus
the
gun
looni
were
fire
on
vehicl
with
mm
amunit
that
ha
a
rang
of
meter
they
were
use
calib
ammunit
not
mm
ammo
mm
would
be
cm
a
shell
of
thi
size
would
be
larger
than
a
lot
of
cannon
shell
sniper
could
have
screen
the
peopl
tri
to
put
out
the
fire
besid
the
ranch
hous
not
fort
apocalyps
it
wa
just
a
hous
despit
what
the
fbi
and
atf
say
wa
on
fire
the
gun
looni
couldnt
hardli
have
been
shoot
at
fire
men
while
there
hous
wa
engulf
in
flame
the
fbi
and
atf
dont
have
ani
excus
for
not
have
fire
engin
there
to
put
out
the
blaze
the
bastard
wait
until
the
fire
wa
well
under
way
befor
they
call
the
fire
depart
in
waco
they
didnt
even
tell
the
fire
depart
to
be
on
standbi
i
sincer
hope
that
the
fbi
atf
attorney
gener
janet
reno
and
all
other
involv
in
thi
fiasco
get
the
just
punish
that
they
so
richli
deserv
someon
should
pay
for
thi
needl
tragic
wast
of
human
life
sadli
these
evil
sob
will
probabl
never
face
justic
the
medium
and
the
govern
will
just
whitewash
thi
incid
and
chalk
it
up
a
be
sole
david
koresh
fault
sadder
still
the
american
peopl
will
probabl
believ
them
next
question
the
problem
is
of
cours
the
law
that
allow
a
bunch
of
rave
nutter
to
collect
a
huge
stack
of
arm
in
the
first
place
thi
is
not
the
problemth
problem
is
that
we
have
a
govern
that
is
becom
more
tyrann
everi
day
if
peopl
decid
to
own
gun
and
live
in
one
place
togeth
then
that
is
their
prerog
on
the
other
hand
if
the
bd
were
in
posess
of
explos
and
illeg
gun
then
the
govern
did
have
the
right
to
search
their
compound
but
the
alleg
that
the
bd
were
in
posess
of
illeg
weapon
hasnt
been
proven
yet
so
im
not
go
to
conclud
that
the
bd
broke
ani
law
david
koresh
wa
accus
of
abus
child
but
if
thi
is
hi
onli
crime
then
the
presenc
of
the
atf
cant
be
justifi
the
atf
is
onli
suppos
to
deal
with
firearm
tobacco
and
alcohol
violat
atf
agent
are
basic
cigarett
copsthey
should
stay
out
of
other
kind
of
lawenforc
action
that
are
out
of
their
jurisdict
better
yet
they
should
be
stcan
imo
the
sequenc
of
event
meant
that
there
realli
wa
no
option
but
to
attempt
some
sort
of
breakthrough
via
an
intervent
if
the
fbi
had
had
the
stomach
for
it
they
could
have
mount
a
commando
type
raid
and
attempt
to
save
the
child
by
shoot
all
the
adult
sound
like
someth
the
s
would
do
human
lifechildren
and
adult
alikeshould
be
treat
with
respecteven
if
they
are
heavilyarm
religi
wacko
david
koresh
lawyer
seem
to
think
that
everyon
would
come
out
peac
sooner
or
later
the
fbi
and
atf
had
noth
but
time
on
their
hand
whi
did
they
have
to
escal
the
situat
and
caus
thi
senseless
tragedi
their
job
is
to
protect
the
public
and
save
life
not
kill
peopl
for
cri
out
loud
it
realli
wa
a
no
win
situat
koresh
had
plenti
of
opportun
to
give
up
and
stand
trial
for
the
murder
of
the
atf
offic
instead
he
order
the
murder
of
the
child
dont
be
so
sure
about
that
i
read
in
a
newspap
today
that
one
of
the
cult
member
said
that
when
one
of
the
tank
went
through
the
wall
that
it
knock
over
a
lantern
which
caus
the
ranch
hous
to
be
caught
on
fire
thi
cult
member
also
said
that
david
koresh
had
no
intent
of
commit
mass
suicid
david
koresh
lawyer
also
confirm
thi
therefor
if
thi
is
true
then
thi
mean
that
the
fbi
and
atf
murder
everyon
in
that
hous
even
if
thi
is
not
true
the
fbi
and
atf
still
dont
get
off
the
hook
becaus
they
wait
a
damn
long
time
to
call
the
waco
fire
depart
perhap
they
want
all
these
peopl
to
die
in
order
to
reject
the
word
of
the
fbi
and
batf
it
is
neccessari
to
beleiv
the
word
of
a
man
who
ha
just
murder
child
and
order
the
suicidemurd
of
hi
other
follow
accord
to
the
account
given
the
batf
attempt
to
serv
a
warrant
upon
koresh
at
the
ranch
and
were
met
by
gunfir
in
a
deliber
attempt
to
murder
them
the
koreshgun
support
claim
that
the
batf
start
shoot
simpli
doe
not
stand
up
if
the
aft
had
gone
there
to
start
shoot
they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponri
than
standard
issu
handgun
for
all
practic
purpos
they
were
unarm
the
bd
follow
had
automat
weapon
your
wrong
on
sever
account
atf
agent
were
adequ
arm
they
had
mp
ar
and
shotgun
some
agent
were
arm
with
automat
pistol
but
not
all
were
the
atf
initi
claimwhich
they
later
retractedthat
agent
were
underarm
is
simpli
ludicr
the
bd
seig
could
not
be
allow
to
go
on
indefinit
the
bd
were
quit
capabl
of
commit
mass
suicid
and
murder
the
child
at
ani
time
a
commando
assault
wa
the
onli
other
like
action
that
could
have
achiev
that
object
that
would
have
been
veri
riski
order
of
magintud
harder
than
antebb
or
the
iranian
embassi
seig
airplan
and
embassi
are
not
design
for
defens
against
attack
ranch
apocalyps
wa
terrorist
are
far
easier
to
dislog
without
casualti
than
allow
the
sieg
to
go
on
wa
not
an
option
either
besid
the
seriou
risk
that
koresh
would
proclaim
armageddon
at
ani
moment
there
wa
the
question
of
the
difficulti
of
keep
the
emmerg
team
on
standbi
over
a
prolong
period
the
longer
the
sieg
went
on
the
more
mental
prepar
koresh
and
hi
follow
would
be
for
a
prolong
sieg
rather
than
go
in
prematur
the
mistak
wa
probabl
to
go
in
too
soon
can
you
think
of
a
better
way
of
get
the
child
out
a
certain
way
the
peopl
who
do
not
want
gun
control
must
obvious
discount
the
entir
govern
stori
thi
is
simpli
rationalis
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simpli
dismiss
the
govern
a
incompet
that
would
requir
them
to
come
up
with
a
solut
themselv
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
govern
conspiraci
theori
wherebi
the
govern
decid
to
set
out
to
murder
peopl
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to
get
gun
control
legisl
through
gun
control
isnt
the
onli
issu
here
if
the
sick
littl
monkey
in
washington
tri
to
use
the
waco
incid
a
a
reason
to
ban
gun
then
they
will
have
demonstr
just
how
fed
up
they
are
what
concern
me
much
more
than
new
gun
control
legisl
is
that
the
govern
seem
to
be
abl
to
get
away
with
st
like
they
did
in
wacothey
are
becom
more
and
more
callou
about
peopl
right
and
the
law
thi
greatli
disturb
me
and
it
should
disturb
you
a
well
thi
conspiraci
theori
assum
that
the
batf
deliber
got
of
it
agent
kill
and
that
the
fbi
etc
actual
enjoy
sit
out
in
the
middl
of
texa
be
shot
at
by
religi
nutter
still
the
conspiraci
theori
is
comfort
it
allow
them
to
pretend
that
waco
prof
noth
except
about
how
incompet
the
govern
is
in
resolv
a
hostag
crisi
no
govt
in
the
world
ha
ever
face
a
compar
situat
quit
probabl
there
wa
no
manner
in
which
it
could
be
peac
resolv
the
blame
doe
not
rest
on
the
fbi
it
rest
on
the
fact
that
koresh
wa
allow
to
get
so
far
in
particular
the
person
who
tip
the
bd
off
in
advanc
ha
the
murder
of
atf
agent
and
child
on

conscienc
there
are
a

number
of
peopl
in

who
predict
the

preach
salvat
through

secur
the
fact
is
that
these
are
the
veri
peopl
who
pose
the
threat
to

in
the
first

the
next
waco
may
not

a

the
