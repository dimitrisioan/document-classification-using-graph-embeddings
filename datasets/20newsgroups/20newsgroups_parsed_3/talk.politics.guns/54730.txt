there
an

a

it
is
incorrect

defens
there
were

not
it
also

is
far
far
more

i
believ
a
larg
number
occur
in

by
the
western

in
pittsburgh
found
that
the
mere
presenc

sharpli
incresas
the
likelihood
a

will
commit
suicid
even
in

ill
i
have
not

so
i
cant
comment
i
will
point
out
canada

suicid
rate
a
indic
that
cultur
far
more
than

there
wa
also
a
