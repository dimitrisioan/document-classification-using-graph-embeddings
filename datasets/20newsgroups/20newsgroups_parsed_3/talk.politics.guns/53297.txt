report
that
the

and
went
ahead
even
when
they
the
bd
knew
the
atf
wa
come
whi
i
believ
thi
raid
wa
ill
plan
becaus
they
onli
had
day
to
plan
it
and
it
wa
continu
when
failur
wa
obviou
becaus
it
had
a
bit
part
in
the
much
larger
polit
agenda
of
presid
clinton
i
would
even
suggest
that
the
loss
of
atf
agent
is
inconsequenti
in
thi
the
context
of
hi
polit
agenda
it
might
even
be
benefici
to

a
it
help
point
up
just
how
evil
these
assualt
weapon
are
further
proof
might
be
that

th
the

assembl
vote
to
overturn
the
assault
weapon
ban
in
that
state
it
look
like
it
might
be
a
tight
vote
but
the
senat
in
nj
wa
go
to

it
would
not
sit
well
to
have
an
eastern
