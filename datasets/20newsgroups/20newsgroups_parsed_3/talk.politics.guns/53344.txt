i
wa
under

to
obtain
fission

ie
plutonium
or
reactorweaponsgrad
uranium
one
wa
requir
to
obtain
a

to
own
such
materi
no
you
mere
have
to
start
work
on

or
els
devis
a
system
to
get
it
from

sourc
btw
the

actual
whi

look
it
up
from
the
materi
we
cover
last
term
in
week
of
gech
nuclear
chemistri
i
could
deriv
what
it
would
take
to
build
a
bomb
that
freshmanlevel
chemistri
big
deal
can
you
make
it
work
that
phdlevel

big

a

charg
i
a
a
chemist
could
synthes
a
varieti
of
explos
from
commonli
avail
chemic
in
the
garag
if
i
felt
like
the
electron
behind
the
deton
and
the
shape
charg
are
a
littl
trickier
howev
but
not
imposs
use
a
few
trick
of
the
trade
and
if
i
realli
want
to
be
nasti
i
could
includ
a
core
of
hydrogen
and
deuterium
so
you
admit
that
there
no
law
that
could
stop
you
physic
asid
could
you
make
one
if
you
had
the
fund
and
time
the
answer
is
ye
so
do
we
lock
you
up
now
becaus
of
thi
sure
you
can
see
where
the
comparison
with
antigun
law
come
into
play
here
of
cours
the
hardest
part
is
get
the
fission
materi
to
start
with
and

btw
u
is
