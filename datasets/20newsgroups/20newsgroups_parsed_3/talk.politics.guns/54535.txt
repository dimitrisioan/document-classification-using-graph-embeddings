the
idea
of
the
card
is
bull
in
and
of
it
self
but
im
curiou
to
know
do
they
plan
on
make
it
a
requir
to
alway
have
it
on
you
or
is
it
onli
go
to
be
requir
to
be
present
when
tri
to
ge
medic
aid
thi
at
least
ha
alreadi
been
determin
the
blue
cross
medic
coverag
for
all
feder
employe
is
a
good
model
for
a
futur
nation
system
to
get
emerg
medic
care
anyon
so
insur
must
alway
carri
their
blue
cross
card
befor
enter
a
hospit
you
must
notifi
blue
cross
or
they
will
refus
to
pay
your
bill
in
an
emerg
where
you
must
be
treat
befor
notifi
them
you
must
inform
them
within
hour
or
if
you
are
unabl
to
do
so
for
medic
reason
the
hospit
must
fail
to
do
so
within
hour
mean
they
will
not
cover
the
hospit
in
you
need
your
card
to
notifi
them
and
without
the
card
the
hospit
certainli
wouldnt
know
they
had
to
therefor
you
are
requir
to
carri
the
card
at
all
time
or
do
without
emerg
medic
coverag
which
work
fine
until
you
end
up
in
the
hospit
becaus
you
were
hit
on
the
head
and
your
wallet
with
your
insur
card
is
stolen
thi
happen
to
me
and
it
took
six
month
to
sort
the
mess
out
these
sort
of
plan
sound
nice
at
first
but
in
the
end
they
just
creat
a
lot
of
paperwork
and
bureaucraci
to
deal
with
all
the
check
and
file
they
involv
tom
the
non
hacker
whoa
have
a
care
what
you
say
tom
the
obviou
answer
to
that
problem
is
to
tatoo
your
nation
id
number
on
you
say
your
forearm
so
you
can
never
leav
home
without
it
hell
it
work
onc
befor
and
that
bring
u
back
to
my
origin

the
