write
no
you
havent
read
it
veri
close
it
say
you
may
answer
no
if
your
civil
right
have
been
restor
that
can
be
done
either
by
the
fed
or
a
a
state
i
think
the
fed
stop
do
thi
for
those
convict
of
violent
feloni
at
least
a
dozen
state
still
restor
a
felon
civil

some
immedi
upon

some
after
a

period
i
will
post
a
list
of
the
state
later
a
quick
question
then
larri
if
a
person
civil
right
have
been
restor
then
are
they
still
consid
a
felon
good
question
i
dont
know
what
the
law
consid
them
imo
if
right
have
been
restor
then
it
make
sens
to
me
that
the
record
of
the
feloni
and
everyth
els
ha
been
purg
and
the
person
in
question
is
no
longer
a
felon
i
believ
thi
is
what
happen
in
some
state
