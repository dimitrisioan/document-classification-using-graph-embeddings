i
need
to
attend

sever
matter
pertain
to
the
state

some
peopl
seem
to
feel
that
the
concept
of
the

is
an
anachro
nism
that
is
out
of
place
in
the
th
centuri
im
not
sure
the
swiss
would
agre
and
i
think
perhap
a
discuss
of
how
the
militia
both
organ
and
unorgan
fit
into
the
defens
plan
of

in

simpli
stop
drill
and
had
to

reconstitut
just
prior

perhap
mr

would
care
to
argu
that
those
of
my
ancestor
who
answer
the
lexington
alarm
had
forfeit
their
right
becaus
their
unit
didnt
drill
for
a
few

in
the
s
i
would
not
be
so
bold
again
i
wish
to
repeat
the
nation
guard
for
all
it
merit
is
not
the
militia
describ
by
the
constitut
nor
by
mr
hamilton
nor
by
mr
henri
nor
by
mr
cox
the
fact
that
the
feder
govern
and
mani
state
are
delinqu
in
their
attent
to
and
organ
of
their
constitut
militia
diminish
neither
their
respons
nor
the
right
of
the
militia
a
detail
in
the
constitut
misunderstand
of
the
natur
and
purpos
of
the
militia
is
but
one
error
that
ha
crept
into
modern
read
of
the
constitut
the
constitut
prohibit
state
from
keep
troop
or
ship
of
war
in
time
of

i
have
heard
some
insist
thi
prevent
state
from
maintain
a

thi

becaus

not
understand
the
mean
of

today

in
