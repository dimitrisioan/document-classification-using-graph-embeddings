themselv
to

if
you
wont
believ
anyth
the
govern

and
the
press
is
not

accord
to
the

logic
then
what
do
you
base
your
statement
on
wild
specul
lace
with
a
healthi
dose
of
paranoia
funni
brent
but
so
far
we
have
heard
two
version
of
the
fact
what
the
govern

thi
includ
what
the
govern
say
that
two
survivor
have
said
what
koresh
lawyer
who
wa
actual
insid
the
compound
say
includ
what
he
say
that
most
of
the
survivor
have
said
strang
but
they
seem
to
disagre
in
most
import
particular
if
anyon
ha
actual
seen
news
report
of
ani
of
the
survivor
speak
firsthand
feel
free
ot
pitch
in
i
may
have
miss
it
but
my
money
is
that
their
stori
will
sound
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
case
and
not
at
all
like
case
sinc
neither
side
would
be
particularli
interest
in
tell
the
truth
you
have
to
weigh
the
fact
given
by
each
yourself
and
weigh
it
with
the
newsreport
if
you
care
mani
cult
member
will
probabl
side
with
the
attorney
and
if
he
is
lie
chang
their
stori
to
match
hi
and
if
the
fed
also
lie
the
cult
member
who
becom
disillus
will
chang
their
stori
to
match
the
fed
neither
side
are
interest
in
the
truth
the
medium
is
more
interest
but
usual
either
dont
have
the
time
to
get
it
straight
or
tie
themselv
to
the
rate
and
deliber
distort
for
me
though
the
black
soot
billow
outsid
the
compound
ad
with
how
fast
the
fire
spread
pont
to
someon
dous
larg
part
of
the
compound
with
some
sort
of
gasolin
or
firestart
i
doubt
the
fed
did
that
a
they
were
more
interest
in
arrest
vernon
the
real
unbalanc
one
at
least
the
one
that
lost
hi
cool
wa
vernon
so
i
figur
that
he
wa
more
like
to
do
it
after
all
he
wa
jesu
be
persecut
by
the
author
and
had
follow
to
hold
onto
so
made
the
decis
he
and
hi
follow
also
