becaus
it
had
a
bit
part
in
the
much
larger
polit

of

clinton
i
would
even
suggest
that
the
loss
of

is
inconsequenti
in
thi
the
context
of
hi

it
might

be

point

assembl

to
overturn
the
assault

in
that

it
look
like
it
might
be
a
tight
vote
but
the
senat
in
nj
wa
go
to
vote
to
overturn
the
ban
it
would
not
sit
well
to
have
an
eastern
state
overturn
an
assault
weapon
ban
given
clinton
state
agenda
on
gun
control
i
suspect
clinton
gave
the
order
to
get
someon
or
some
group
with
assualt
weapon
and
have
the
press
present
they
