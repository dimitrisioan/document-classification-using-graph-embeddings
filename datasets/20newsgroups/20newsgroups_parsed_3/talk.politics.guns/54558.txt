the

with
whi
would

it
wouldnt

purpos
becaus
of
the
weather
in

everyon
now
claim
that
it
wa
for
cook
stop
and
think
about
thi
c
ga
wa
be
pump
into
the
build
and
i
presum
that
everyon
wa
wear
ga
mask
either
bought
or
some
type
of
makeshift
type
and
thi
had
been
go
on
for
hour
i
dont
know
if
you
have
ever
been
around
c
but
i
have
be
expo
to
c
ga
wa
part
of
my
armi
train
so
i
know
that
without
a
mask
it
veri
uncomfort
and
make
your
eye
water
nose
run
and
make
you
sick
in
the
stomach
and
with
the
mask
it
is
veri
difficult
to
drink
water
much
le
eat
so
my
question
now
is
whi
were
they
cook
food
i
will
buy
that
a
lantern
could
have
been
knock
over
and
caus
the
fire
but
that
stove
wa
not
be
use
for
cook
unless
they
were
even
more
crazi
than
the
atffbi
