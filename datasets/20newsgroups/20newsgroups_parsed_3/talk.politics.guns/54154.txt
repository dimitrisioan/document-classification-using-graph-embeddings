strider
pm
apr
i
think
most
of
u
would
rather
be
held
up
with
a
knife
than
with
a
gun
but
how
the
hell
are
you
go
to
manag
that
you
still
havent
offer
ive
been
watch
thi
knife
vers
gun
bit
for
a
while
now
even
contribut
a
few
comment
but
thi
stuff
id
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
ha
got
to
come
from
ignor
i
use
to
think
pretti
much
the
same
thing
then
i
got
educ
peopl
do
not
a
a
rule
understand
how
deadli
knife
can
be
or
how
quickli
you
can
be
kill
with
one
most
peopl
dont
understand
that
it
take
le
than
an
inch
of
penetr
in
some
area
to
caus
quick
within
a
minut
or
so
death
the
death
rate
from
handgun
and
knife
are
within
a
few
percentag
point
of
each
other
mani
peopl
not
realiz
how
deadli
knife
are
tri
their
luck
and
thu
more
get
injur
by
knife
a
gun
is
deadli
onli
in
a
singl
direct
and
it
onli
advantag
is
that
it
is
a
remot
control
weapon
a
contact
weapon
such
a
a
knife
control
a
spheric
area
to
foot
in
diamet
most
peopl
have
never
seen
knife
wound
asid
from
slice
a
finger
by
accid
from
foot
or
so
a
knife
is
veri
nearli
an
even
match
for
a
holster
gun
in
experienc
hand
even
if
the
knife
wielder
ha
onli
moder
skill
from
insid
foot
or
so
a
knife
is
a
match
for
a
drawn
gun
a
knife
is
utterli
silent
it
never
jam
and
never
run
out
of
ammunit
it
is
limit
onli
by
the
speed
dexter
skill
and
abil
of
it
wielder
crimin
in
gener
are
young
fast
and
strong
it
interest
to
note
that
the
pattern
slash
attack
use
by
mani
martial
artist
remark
resembl
the
wild
uncontrol
slash
attack
of
novic
ive
talk
to
sever
well
train
martial
artist
they
have
unanim
agre
that
if
they
ever
go
up
against
a
knife
they
simpli
plan
on
be
cut
hope
not
a
bad

requir
facil
and
equip
practic
with

and
someth
to
simul

popsicl
stick
or
tooth
brush
crimin
practic
their
knife
attack
in
prison
if
you
have
not
train
against
knife
with
a
firearm
and
do
not
realiz
these
fact
the
first
inkl
you
will
have
that
someth
is
wrong
is
the
knife
rip
through
your
throat
or
in
the
case
of
an
experienc
attack
part
of
your
bodi
fall
off
onto
the
ground
a
year
old
man
with
arthriti
can
close
that
yard
distanc
and
gut
you
in
about
one
and
a
half
second
denni
tueller
with
a
broken
leg
in
a
walk
cast
manag
it
in
two
ive
seen
peopl
close
that
distanc
and
strike
in
second
im
old
over
weight
and
slow
i
can
do
it
in
second
ive
seen
morgu
footag
of
peopl
kill
with
edg
weapon
that
you
would
not
believ
how
about
a
singl
stab
wound
to
the
chest
with
a
tabl
fork
in
thi
case
the
attack
use
the
handl
not
the
point
end
add
to
thi
the
fact
that
hand
gun
stop
power
is
larg
a
myth
except
in
the
case
of
a
central
nervou
system
shot
or
a
round
that
destroy
the
skelet
structur
it
take
anywher
from
to
twelv
second
for
a
bullet
wound
to
take
effect
thi
is
true
of
even
heart
shot
there
is
the
case
of
the
polic
woman
in
la
the
first
record
survivor
of
a
shot
to
the
heart
that
ladi
not
onli
kill
her
attack
but
chase
him
down
to
do
it
all
four
of
her
shot
fire
after
she
had
been
shot
struck
the
perp
atta
girl
the
bullet
enter
her
on
a
downward
angl
went
through
the
apex
of
her
heart
down
through
the
diaphragm
clip
her
liver
and
destroy
her
spleen
it
then
exit
her
back
leav
a
tenni
ball
size
hole
she
die
about
six
time
on
the
oper
tabl
but
wa
out
of
the
hospit
in
day
and
wa
back
on
full
duti
in
eight
month
she
wa
off
duti
at
the
time
and
not
wear
her
vest
she
wa
on
her
way
home
so
happen
to
have
her
gun
no
she
doesnt
think
civilian
should
have
the
same
right
sigh
the
moral
of
the
stori
is
that
even
if
you
do
manag
to
shoot
a
knife
attack
youd
better
be
plan
on
do
some
dodg
a
good
altern
is
to
shoot
for
and
break
the
pelvi
peopl
can
often
walk
a
littl
on
broken
leg
but
a
broken
pelvi
will
nearli
alway
anchor
them
mani
firearm
school
recommend
pelvi
shot
against
contact
weapon
the
target
is
a
larg
a
the
tradit
center
of
mass
and
is
more
reliabl
to
stop
somebodi
with
a
contact
weapon
assum
a
calib
power
enough
to
do
the
job
hot
s
on
up
will
usual
do
thi
rememb
folk
the
idea
isnt
to
take
em
with
you
but
for
you
to
live
and
them
to
fail
whatev
the
consequ
for
them
thi
the
reason
kill
them
isnt
our
goal
or
in
mani
case
even
good
enough
to
keep
u
aliv
i
dont
want
to
face
a
violent
attack
of
ani
sort
know
what
i
now
know
i
cant
rightli
say
id
rather
face
a
knife
than
an
gun
it
would
have
to
depend
on
the
attack
and
if
i
could
pick
and
choos
i
wouldnt
be
there
thi
is
realli
the
bottom
line
crimin
do
not
fear
the
law
crimin
do
not
fear
the
weapon
they
fear
the
citizen
behind
the
weapon
that
ha
shown
the
resolut
and
determin
to
do
whatev
it
take
rick
