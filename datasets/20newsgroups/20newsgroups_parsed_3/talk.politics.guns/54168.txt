re
gun
lover
wa
re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
iftccutalkpoliticsgun
vincent
fox
am
apr
thi
isnt
recgun
so
mayb
thi
is
get
a
bet
technic
but
i
cant
resist
a
revolv
also
ha
the
advantag
that
if
it
misfir
you
just
pull
the
trigger
again
sometim
depend
on
whi
it
misfir
a
doubleact
revolv
almost
all
of
them
can
be
handcock
first
but
will
fire
mere
by
pull
the
trigger
i
cant
imagin
do
much
combat
type
shoot
singl
action
a
misfir
in
a
revolv
mere
mean
you
must
pull
the
trigger
again
to
rotat
to
the
next
round
assum
the
cylind
will
rotat
a
revolv
can
be
carri
with
the
th
chamber
empti
and
under
the
hammer
for
maximum
safeti
but
still
can
be
drawn
and
fire
with
an
easi
motion
even
one
hand
never
hurt
to
err
on
the
side
of
safeti
but
if
youv
got
one
of
those
new
fangl
hammer
block
or
transfer
bar
safeti
it
unnecessarili
redund
id
rather
have
the
extra
round
speedload
for
a
revolv
allow
reload
almost
a
fast
a
magazin
on
semiauto
can
be
faster
depend
on
user
quit
true
speed
loader
are
a
littl
le
conveni
to
pack
around
than
magazin
though
a
misfir
in
a
semiauto
will
requir
you
to
clear
a
jam
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
a
you
realiz
hey
it
jam
befor
start
to
do
anyth
about
clear
it
true
but
thi
is
a
train
function
most
semiauto
must
have
the
slide
work
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
polic
carri
their
semiauto
with
the
chamber
load
and
hammer
cock
but
a
safeti
engag
i
do
not
consid
thi
safe
howev
you
must
tradeoff
safeti
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employ
a
a
revolv
cock
and
lock
for
singl
action
or
hammer
down
on
doubl
action
are
the
onli
carri
mode
that
make
sens
the
seri
colt
for
exampl
are
quit
safe
to
carri
thi
way
there
are
some
doubleact
semiauto
out
there
but
the
complex
of
oper
of
mani
of
them
requir
more
train
agre
now
that
ive
shot
off
my
mouth
a
bit
let
me
back
some
of
thi
up
it
is
true
that
a
simpl
misfir
on
a
revolv
doesnt
cost
you
much
on
the
other
hand
ive
had
all
sort
of
interest
thing
happen
over
the
year
for
exampl
ive
had
factori
ammunit
that
ha
had
high
primer
a
high
primer
will
tie
your
revolv
up
somewher
from
second
to
minut
while
you
tri
to
pound
the
action
open
to
clear
the
problem
an
auto
jack
the
slide
and
continu
ive
had
bullet
come
out
of
the
case
keep
the
cylind
from
turn
see
clear
paragraph
abov
about
the
worst
that
can
happen
with
a
semi
auto
is
a
doubl
feed
thi
can
be
clear
in
second
most
revolv
are
more
fragil
then
semi
auto
there
are
all
sort
of
close
toler
part
and
fit
involv
drop
the
gun
or
a
blow
to
the
gun
or
all
sort
of
thing
can
take
it
out
of
action
mani
of
the
problem
that
can
be
cure
on
the
spot
with
a
qualiti
semi
auto
take
a
gun
smith
for
a
revolv
in
short
a
revolv
may
be
le
like
to
malfunct
but
a
a
rule
when
it
doe
your
out
of
the
fight
the
major
of
malfunct
that
occur
with
semi
auto
doe
not
fall
into
that
categori
vincint
make
mani
good
point
in
thi
post
but
leaf
off
the
oppos
view
of
most
of
them
a
real
good
start
place
is
ayoob
the
semi
auto
pistol
for
polic
and
self
defens
in
gener
id
agre
the
revolv
is
an
excel
first
gun
and
self
defens
weapon
for
somebodi
that
doe
not
have
the
time
and
inclin
that
is
necessari
for
the
train
and
practic
need
to
use
a
semi
auto
effect
a
a
self
defens
arm
most
cop
are
notori
indiffer
to
firearm
if
the
depart
isnt
go
to
train
them
they
arent
go
to
take
the
time
on
their
own
there
is
no
doubt
that
train
is
an
issu
the
amount
of
train
requir
for
effect
use
of
a
semi
auto
is
probabl
sever
time
that
of
a
revolv
mani
cop
dont
bother
for
myself
id
hate
to
be
limit
to
one
or
the
other
id
rather
pick
what
fit
better
with
my
person
inclin
what
im
wear
that
day
and
so
on
like
the
moder
on
recgun
say
buy
em
all
that
said
i
have
to
admit
that
often
my
advic
to
peopl
think
of
buy
their
first
defens
arm
is
right
after
take
a
class
get
a
ruger
or
smith
revolv
sorri
colt
fan
colt
revolv
are
ok
too
if
thi
post
had
gone
the
other
way
id
be
argu
for
revolv
rick
