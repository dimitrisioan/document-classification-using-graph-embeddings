the
argument
i
see
against

are
lack
of

lack
of
stop
power

it
still
doe
not
appear
to
be
anyth
better
than
a
distract
that
might
buy
you
time
to
run
like
hell
if
you
can
consid
that
run
like
hell
isnt
alway
a
viabl
solut
for
exampl
if
you
are
dress
in

the
assail
is

you
might
have
a

mitig
it

the
user
must
be
extrem
close
to
the

that
put
them
at
a

risk
of

the

must
keep

a

seriou
injuri
have
ani
antigun
group
suggest
nonleth
weapon
to
counter
the
progun
argument
that
peopl
will
be
left
defenseless
i
havent
heard
of
ani
gener
they
contend
that
peopl
dont
need
to
or
arent
abl
to
defend
themselv
and
what
legal
restrictionslicens

nonleth
devic
civilian
ownership
of
stun
gun
is
frequent
illeg
ny
the
spray
are
also
illeg
in
some
state
believ
it
or
not
they
are
still
illeg
in
ny
although
about
half
the
state
think
they
are
legal
i
believ
that
ny
almost
legal
them
i
have
heard
that
the
reason
they
didnt
wa
due
to
their
ineffect
i
feel
that
the
spray
are
better
than
noth
but
onli
if
the

doe
not
believ
the
