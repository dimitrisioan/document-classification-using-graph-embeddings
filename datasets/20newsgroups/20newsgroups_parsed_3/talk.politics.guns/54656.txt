sourc
of
these
rumor
it
may
be
the
truth
but
it
may
not
be
we
may
never

we
must
question
it
though
whi
no

coverar
what
were
they
hide
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
seriou
discus
of
thi
incid
i
believ
the
move
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problem
with
some
of
the
tactic
after
watch
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
a
well
a
cnn
and
nightlin
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
action
could
it
have
been
possibl
to
have
taken
koresh
outsid
the
compound
at
some
time
befor
the
feb
th
raid
it
would
seem
so
could
a
further
wait
have
result
in
a
differ
outcom
they
would
still

the

think

contribut
to
the
outcom
folk
that
are
sleep
depriv
tend
not
to
think
clearli
and
a
few
other
question
like
i
said
i
believ
the
action
taken
in
gener
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reserv
i
feel
strongli
they
were
not
proper

he
would
not
