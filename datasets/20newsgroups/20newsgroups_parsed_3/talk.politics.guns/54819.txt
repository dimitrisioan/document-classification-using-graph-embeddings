someth
just
did
not
make

and
i
wa
wonder

machinegun
well
i
got
to
look
in
my
law
dictionari
and
i
found
that
a
person
might
also
be
an
artifici
entiti
that
is
creat
by
govern
and
ha
no
right
under
the
feder
constitut

dont
understand
is
how
a
statut
like

be
enforc
on
an
individu
so
someon
tell
me
how
my
govern
can
tell
me
what

of
the
lost
ark
u
im
not
a
lawyer
but
to
the
best
of
my
understand
the
congress
ha
no
more
right
than
what
is
enumer
in
the
constitut
that
is
the
prime
reason
whi
the
nation
firearm
act
is
base
on
collect
revenu
sinc
the
congress
ha
the
author
to
levi
tax
the
nfa
is
a
tax
act
and
the
registr
requir
within
it
is
to
assist
in
that
tax
collect
usc
in
order
to
be
constitut
must
have
a
basi
on
a
particular
author
grant
to
the
congress
by
the
constitut
congress
can
not
arbitrarili
ban
a
substanc
or
product
that
is
whi
prohibit
came
into
effect
onli
by
pas
an
ammend
what
you
said
about
constitution
of
law
need
to
be
clarifi
i
believ
that
an
unconstitut
law
wa
never
constitut
when
a
law
is
determin
by
the
suprem
court
to
be
unconstitut
that
law
wa
never
realli
a
law
the
veri
natur
of
the
law
be
unconstitut
invalid
the
law
at
it
incept
plea
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
when
a
law
is
deem
to
be
unconstitut
anyon
convict
of
break
that
law
is
absolv
i
dont
believ
usc
ha
ever
been
challeng
in
court
nfa
ha
been
invalid
in
two
feder
district

case
one
may
have
been
