what

is
not
the
fault
of
the
batf
if
they
would

had
the
proper
equip
and

then
they
could
of
captur
the

none
of
thi
would

happen
the

a

if
they

do
similar

assault
all
the
time
and
they
are
veri
veri
good
about
it
in
both
the
tactic
and
legal
part
of
it
but
i
suspect
that
the

would
not
have
touch
it
