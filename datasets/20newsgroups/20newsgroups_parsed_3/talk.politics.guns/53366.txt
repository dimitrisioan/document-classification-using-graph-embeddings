yesterday
and
pick
up
back
copi
of
the
nation
crime
survey
in
an
effort
to
examin
what
it
said
about
selfdefens
with
a
firearm
i
havent
ground
through
much
in
the
way
of
number
yet
but
a
coupl
of

jump
out
at
me
first
onli
and
specifi
the
type
of
weapon
use
in
self
defens
and
refer

second
is
that
while

about
from

fell
by
almost
unless
there
an
explan
for
thi
im
tempt
to
mark
