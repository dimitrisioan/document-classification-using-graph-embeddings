lengthi
excerpt
from
an
australian

made
in
that
clearli
show
that
thi
wa
a
cult
give
me
a
camera
and
time
with
you
and
i
can
present
excerpt
that
show
you
to
be
a
cult
leader
guarente
thank
for
my
laugh
of
the
day
definit
a
veri
silli
supposit
you
should
at
least
view
the
whole
documentari
befor
you
claim
it
a
a
sourc
i
would
if
i
could
the
news
show
that
show
the
lengthi
excerpt
also
had
interview
with
the
filmmak
who
made
the
documentari
who
basic
confirm
what
wa
shown
in
the
excerpt
from
the
time
he
spent
at
the
compound
in
i
am
not
plea
with
the
batf
handl
of
the
affair
i
think
they
bungl
it
badli
from
the
start
but
i
dont
think
they
are
respons
for
the
fire
which
start
in
two
differ
place
two
place
eh
you
saw
thi
or
did
the
wonder
fbi
tell
you
thi
i
saw
one
place
i
believ
that
thi
wa
report
by
local
radio
report
on
site
a
fire
start
in
a
three
stori
tower
at
the
same
time
a
the
two
stori
window
shown
on
the
tv
coverag
the
batf
is
by
no
mean
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handl
of
thi
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intent
start
the
fire
is
ludicr
i
suspect
that
there
were
plenti
of
camerapeopl
will
to
risk
small
arm
fire
to
get
some
good
footag
these
peopl
were
told
to
get
the
hell
out
of
camera
rang
whi
couldnt
answer
thi
one
eh
thi
is
the
most
import
question
of
all
it
is
the
root
caus
of
all
the
other
suspicion
i
thought
about
mention
how
reagan
and
the
militari
treat
the
press
in
grenada
and
how
that
set
the
preced
but
decid
it
wasnt
worthi
of
discus
if
the
news
report
got
shot
you
can
bet
hi
famili
would
sue
the
govern
for
let
him
into
the
danger
area
the
root
caus
of
suspicion
in
my
mind
is
whi
peopl
wouldnt
flee
a
build
that
had
numer
exit
dure
the
minut
time
it
took
to
burn
down
or
whi
didnt
they
flee
hour
earlier
when
the
tear
ga
wa
first
introduc
i
can
find
no
ration
explan
for
their
behavior
