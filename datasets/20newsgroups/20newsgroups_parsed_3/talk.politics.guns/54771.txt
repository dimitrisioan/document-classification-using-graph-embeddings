nearli
imposs
i
find
thi
explan
to
be
complet
plausibl
doesnt
mean
that
it
true
but
i
dont
find
it
intrins
le
believ
than
the
govern
stori
the
fbi
also
said
that
the
davidian
had
a
methanphetamin
lab
in
their
basement
and
that
the
davidian
had
cal
machin

do
you
believ

do
you
disbeliev
everyth
the

i
balanc
my
gut
reaction
to
question
author
togeth
with
the
independ
fact
a
i
see
them
on
video
i
usual
adopt
the
scenario
that
is
simplest
and
most
plausibl
i
do
not
gener
believ
in
conspiraci
theori
that
involv
complic
and
unlik
scenario
i
concur
the
batf
is
by
no
mean
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handl
of
thi
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intent
start
the
fire
is
ludicr
inde
accord
to
the
lawyer
the
davidian
survivor
say
that
lantern
were
knock
over
dure
the
probe
and
that
how
the
fire
start
a
tragic
accid
if
true
do
you
trust
that
snivel
littl
piec
of
sht
special
agent
rick
he
seem
to
think
he
is
a
comedian
and
the
medium
who
laugh
at
hi
sick
joke
are
just
a
guilti
a
he
imho
up
until
now
the
batf
had
been
make
me
sick
today
the
peopl
insid
the
compound
who
set
the
fire
made
me
sick
keep
the
child
insid
the
compund
when
they
should
have
been
releas
earlier
with
the
other
peopl
week
ago
is
absolut
inexcus
not
releas
them
befor
decid
to
set
the
place
afir
is
the
work
of
madman
two
of
the
nine
who
escap
the
compound
said
the
fire
wa
deliber
set
by
cult
member
correct
the
fbi
say
that
two
of
the
nine
said
the
fire
wa
deliber
set
by
the
sect
member
if
the
fire
were
set
by
accid
or
by
peopl
outsid
the
compound
i
would
have
expect
far
more
cult
member
to
flee
the
compound
or
at
least
come
out
shoot
see
abov
thi
one
is
go
to
be
thoroughli
investig
mayb
well
eventu
get
some
idea
of
what
happen
my
view
is
that
from
begin
to
end
thi
oper
wa
a
botch
and
that
it
is
complet
possibl
that
nut
case
who
were
otherwis
lawabid
citizen
were
victim
of
a
bureaucrat
