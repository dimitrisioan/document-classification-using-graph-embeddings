subject
re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
in
articl
thoma
parsli
write
i
dont
rememb
the
figur
exactli
but
there
were
about
death
in
texa
in
that
wa
caus
by
gun
thi
is
more
than
those
bee
kill
in
caraccid
ye
there
could
be
that
low
sentenc
or
high
poverti
could
influenc
the
figur
but
theyr
still
pretti
high
right
i
also
believ
texa
ha
some
of
the
most
liber
gunlaw
in
usa
and
youd
be
wrong
about
that
too
note
that
texa
isnt
uniqu
in
thi
more
withgun
death
than
withcar
death
but
some
of
the
other
state
where
it
happen
have
extrem
strict
gun
law
oop
so
much
for
the
mean
it
isnt
clear
that
the
comparis
mean
anyth
anyway
a
car
accid
are
unintent
while
gun
death
arent
but
if
were
go
to
make
it
let
at
least
be
honest
i
should
not
suffer
becaus
of
other
we
all
agre
on
thi
one
but
we
also
live
in
a
sociati
and
therefor
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
our
freedom
note
the
give
it
up
for
what
gun
control
doesnt
have
ani
benefit
so
it
fail
by
thi
standard
do
you
have
an
insur
then
youll
have
to
pay
becaus
of
what
other
do
note
that
insur
give
me
someth
in
return
gun
control
doesnt
what
the
hell
is
he
tri
to
say
when
you
live
in
a
societi
usa
are
stilll
count
a
one
you
have
to
saccrific
the
question
is
how
much
that
half
the
question
the
rest
is
and
what
do
you
get
for
your
sacrific
if
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
noth
a
it
is
for
gun
control
then
we
dont
have
to
ask
the
first
question
becaus
get
noth
mean
that
no
sacrific
is
justifi
andi
