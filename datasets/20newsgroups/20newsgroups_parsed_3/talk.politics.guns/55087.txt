you
were
right
the
first

law
enforc

should
keep

anybodi
hous
ok
let
me
correct
my
unfortun
choic
of
word
i
just
hope
that
the
law
enforc
agenc
keep
your
attitud
in
mind
the
next
time
your
wife
is
gangrap
by
a
bunch
of
juvenil
drugdeal
thug
while
she
wa
jog
in
the
park
no
strike
that
etc
the
batf
came
out
with
hors
trailer
men
ninja
uniform
machin
gun
and
stun
grenad
and
use
them
befor
koresh
could
even
look
at
the
warrant
koresh
fought
back
and
peopl
die
the
key
part
of
thi
sentens
is
koresh
fought
back
thi
wa
hi
big
mistak
when
the
polic
decid
to
exert
their
author
over
you
you
dont
fight
back
unless
you
want
peopl
to
get
hurt
you
ceas
all
resist
and
signal
your
submiss
to
their
author
the
cop
they
are
the
bo
you
are
the
subject
the
concept
of
defens
against
illeg
action
under
color
of
law
is
kaput
no
longer
is
it
govern
of
the
peopl
by
the
peopl
it
govern
of
the
peopl
by
the
biggest
gun
the
idea
of
sort
it
out
in
court
later
is
fine
but
one
ha
to
get
to
court
in
one
piec
to
do
that
korash
had
good
reason
to
think
that
he
wa
not
go
to
get
that
chanc
see
below
arent
in
it
to
beat
up
and
kill
peopl
in
spite
of
the
action
of
a
few
bad
appl
if
you
quit
resist
they
quit
hit
perhap
the
batf
did
over
react
to
the
threat
pose
by
koresh
perhap
they
did
use
too
much
forc
ok
fine
im
will
to
conced
to
that
point
if
suffici
proof
is
produc
and
i
admit
that
there
is
some
evid
to
indic
thi
howev
resist
the
batf
is
the
worst
thing
koresh
could
have
done
if
they
hadnt
resist
there
is
a
good
chanc
that
no
one
would
have
been
hurt
remeb
they
were
use
stun
grenad
not
antipersonnel
grenad
if
the
bd
were
not
in
violat
of
ani
rember
korash
didnt
get
to
sort
thi
all
out
seren
type
at
hi
keyboard
he
heard
some
kind
of
explos
go
off
he
saw
he
wa
be
attack
with
no
overt
action
from
him
yet
he
could
no
more
say
oh
it
ok
it
onli
stun
grenad
anymor
than
i
could
he
slam
the
door
at
that
point
and
proceed
to
repel
the
attack
he
felt
in
genuin
fear
of
hi
life
i
know
i
would
be
in
fear
of
my
life
at
that
point
have
you
ever
been
shot
at
how
clear
and
logic
could
you
think
under
that
pressur
when
you
might
have
all
of
or
second
to
evalu
what
is
go
on
and
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
law
enforc
intend
to
bring
in
their
suspect
horizont
for
all
we
know
he
wa
inform
by
someon
say
someth
like
hey
guy
the
batf
is
come
like
gangbust
and
they
mean
to
wast
you
accord
to
the
latest
news
the
releas
warrant
so
we
are
told
said
the
reason
for
thi
ww
iii
raid
wa
that
korash
group
had
spent
around
on
firearm
and
relat
stuff
over
an
undetermin
period
now
even
assum
that
the
figur
isnt
calcul
like
the
fed
do
a
drug
siezur
for
peopl
that
isnt
realli
all
that
much
you
price
decent
gun
late
hell
i
can
think
of
a
person
right
now
that
probabl
ha
that
much
for
one
individu
mostli
machinegun
sure
he
is
an
avid
collector
but
unless
a
new
law
ha
been
pass
it
is
not
illeg
nor
an
indic
of
anyth
illeg
to
have
a
lot
of
gun
also
note
that
the
warrant
had
noth
to
say
about
machin
gun
so
what
is
the
justif
of
thi
cowboy
raid
other
than
a
romp
gone
bad
for
some
antigun
medium
hype
to
support
clinton
push
for

they
would
have
been
releas
a
they
had
been
befor
if
thi
had
happen
and
it
turn
out
that
the
batf
had
use
too
much
forc
then
the
bd
would
have
ground
for
a
law
suit
and
for

dont

im
not
comment
one

but
that
not
what
they
want
they
got
tip
off
that
the

wa
on

rather
than
adopt

batf
knew
the

they

were
so
big
so
bad
they
would
have
a
cakewalk
at
the
