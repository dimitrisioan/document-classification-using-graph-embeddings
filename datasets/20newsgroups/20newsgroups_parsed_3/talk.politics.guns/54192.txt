write
say
your
in
a
situat
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebodi
you
give
them
a
chanc
to
get
away
but
they
decid
to
continu
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shoot
and
kill
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cop
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
your
use
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provid
of
cours
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
for
me
it
would
be
an
obviou
choic
arm
selfdef
is
clearli
and
strongli
protect
by
the
colorado
constitut
and
the
law
of
the
state
in
the
veri
clearcut
situat
of
your
hypothet
i
wouldnt
have
anyth
to
fear
from
the
polic
unless
i
had
been
publicli
carri
the
weapon
conceal
someth
im
not
in
the
habit
of
do
even
then
the
worst
id
have
to
deal
with
wa
a
class
misdemeanor
even
if
the
situat
were
not
so
clear
and
i
might
have
to
worri
about
arrest
for
manslaught
or
homicid
it
would
still
be
safer
to
wait
for
the
polic
if
i
were
to
leav
and
tri
to
avoid
polic
involv
id
be
commit
sever
feloni

my
chanc
of
claim

realli
wa
selfdef
the
prosecut
would
ask
whi
did
you
run
away
and
hide
from

howev
thi
decis
might
not
be
so
clearcut
if
someon
in
say
washington
dc
were
to
use
a
gun
in

he
would
automat
be
guilti
of
