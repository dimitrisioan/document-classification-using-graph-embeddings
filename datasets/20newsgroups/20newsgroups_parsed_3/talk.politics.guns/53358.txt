re
the

dan
sorenson
write
ye
i
am
progun
and
ye
i
do
disagre
with
thi
statement
nuclear
weapon
in
and
of
themselv
are
danger
radioact
decay
of
plutonium
and
uranium
a
well
a
the
tritium
in
the
weapon
tend
to
be
somewhat
danger
to
live
thing
can
you
say
neutron
flux
can
you
say
i
get
more
background
radiat
from
live
in
denver
or
have
an
offic
in
a
limeston
build
than
i
do
stand
next
to
a
power
reactor
at
full
power
or
stand
next
to
a
nuclear
warhead
that
is
arm
look
up
shield
in
your
dictionari
you
dont
need
six
foot
of
lead
to
make
decent
shield
your
dead
skin
cell
layer
doe
an
excel
job
on
alpha
particl
and
neutron
are
slow
by
mere
water
what
do
you
think
of
you
is
but
whatev
the
neutron
hit
ha
a
good
chanc
of
absorb
the
neutron
and
becom
radioact
itself
mostli
that
mean
water
turn
into
harmless
heavi
water
but
some
neutron
would
also
hit
bone
and
the
result
harmful
secondard
radioact
would
remain
in
the
bodi
for
decad
i
think
an
unshield
nuclear
warhead
could
reason
be
consid
a
public
health
hazard
a
for
a
shield
warhead
i
think
a
fair
amount
of
maintainc
is
requir
for
it
to
remain
safe
shield
eg
storag
in
a
dri
temperatureregul
facil
etc
for
privat
ownership
to
be
unregul
i
think
a
singl
individu
must
be
abl
not
onli
to
keep
the
weapon
but
keep
it
in
a
safe
condit
if
ani
random
privat
citizen
could
not
properli
keep
maintain
and
store
a
nuclear
weapon
then
some
regul
is
clearli
appropri
plu
these
thing
have
no
self
defens
purpos
it
kinda
hard
to
justifi
their
use
a
a
militia
weapon
when
at
best
they
are
meant
for
battlefield
use
lowyield
weapon
or
at
worst
for
industri
target
obliter
translat
citi
and
popul
center
if
the
militia
ha
a
it
job
the
overthrow
of
an
illeg
govern
they
are
inde
use
weapon
to
the
militia
i
disagre
with
thi
purpos
the
job
of
the
militia
is
to
defend
themselv
and
their
commun
if
you
look
at
the
american
revolut
a
an
exampl
the
militia
won
by
seper
themselv
from
and
becom
independ
of
a
repress
govern
they
didnt
overthrow
it
and
those
commun
canada
and
england
for
exampl
that
didnt
defend
themselv
were
still
under
that
same
old
regim
if
the
role
of
the
militia
were
offens
to
go
out
and
destroy
repress
govern
nuclear
weapon
might
be
appropri
but
their
job
is
defens
and
nuclear
weapon
arent
suit
for
that
there
is
also
the
question
of
person
and
collect
arm
the
second
amend
defin
protect
ownership
of
person
weapon
sinc
the
veri
natur
of
the
militia
requir
member
to
provid
their
own
arm
but
it
isnt
clear
if
it
cover
other
arm
certainli
not
all
member
would
suppli
for
exampl
a
tank
onli
a
few
could
or
if
they
were
to
be
use
effect
should
howev
those
provid
the
heavi
weapon
have
a
disproportion
control
over
the
militia
and
it
fierpow
the
militia
a
the
framer
envis
them
were
extrem
democrat
if
onli
of
the
member
support
the
caus
onli
would
respond
to
a
muster
and
the
militia
firepow
would
be
proportion
reduc
militia
firepow
and
the
popular
will
were
therefor
link
but
if
a
small
minor
of
the
member
suppli
a
larg
fraction
of
the
firepow
in
the
form
of
heavi
weapon
thi
would
all
chang
the
militia
firepow
would
depend
on
the
will
of
a
small
minor
not
of
the
gener
public
wors
that
minor
would
be
quit
differ
from
the
gener
public
at
the
veri
least
they
would
be
much
richer
a
a
result
i
think
the
natur
and
charact
of
the
militia
requir
that
each
member
provid
a
roughli
equal
share
of
the

firepow
hi
