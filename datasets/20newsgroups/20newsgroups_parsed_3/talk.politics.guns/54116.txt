the
polic

everyth
the
gang
have
and
then
some
plu
theyv
got
access
to
the
nation
guard
via
the
governor
if
thing
get
too
rough
that
tank
for
those
of
you
whove
never
seen
them
at
play
of
cours
theyv
got
rifl
and
helicopt
and

far
a
fullyautomat
weapon

can
be
a
lot
better
arm
if
you
want
to
hit
what
you
aim
at
what
seem
to
be
happen
here
is
the
situat
get
total
blown
out
of
proport
in
my
post
i
wa
refer
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruis
around
the
citi
v
gang
member
of
cours
the
polic
have
access
to
the
thing
that
you
mention
but
do
they
use
tank
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
cours
they
dont
and
that
the
point
i
wa
tri
to
make
everi
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
alway
see
cop
come
in
the
major
that
i
see
are
still
carri
revolv
not
that
there
is
anyth
wrong
with
a
revolv
but
if
your
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
coupl
of
automat
in
hi
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handgun
your
go
to
be
at
a
disadvantag
even
with
train
how
so
i
think
your
make
assumpt
here
that
might
not
necessarili
be
true
my
person
choic
would
be
a
semiauto
but
revolv
are
just
a
effect
if
not
more
so
i
have
been
at
a
shoot
rang
where
gang
gang
member
were
practic
shoot
they
were
actual
practic
take
out
their
gun
a
quick
a
possibl
and
shoot
at
the
target
and
they
werent
do
too
badli
either
relev
pleas
you
sound
shock
but
that
hardli
prof
anyth
the
univers
cop
here
who
are
are
state
cop
are
arm
better
than
the
chicago
polic

seem
most
state
cop
are
i
dont
know
where
you
are
origin
from
david
but
you
live
in
tenness
and
i
live
in
chicago
and
see
thi
crap
everyday
on
the
news

a
tad
differ
here
than
there
wait

seriou
gun
control

to
the
dash
board

that
all
the
polic

outgun
