american
express
card
gun
club
if
you
are
a
member
you
can
borrow
weaponssupris
you
are
suppos
to
train
with
a
for
the
month
then
you
can
start
with
anyth
bigger
driver
licenc
forgot
that
usa
is
the
land
of
car
get
one
in
scandinavia
and
northern
europ
is
not
easi
averag
time
is
about
hour
of
train
and
the
cost
is
rather
but
we
think
thi
is
accept
becaus
a
car
is
not
a
toy
and
bad
driver
tend
to
hurt
other
if
you
are
realli
bad
you
wont
get
a
lincenc
abus
by
the
gover
thi
seem
to
be
one
of
the
main
problem
ani
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abus
by
the
gover
either
some
of
you
are
a
littl
paranoid
no
offenc
or
you
should
get
a
new
gover
you
do
have
elect
gun
n
crimin
most
weapon
use
by
crimin
today
are
stolen
known
crimin
can
not
buy
weapon
that
one
of
the
point
of
gun
control
and
becaus
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europ
we
dont
have
ani
problem
with
smuggl
gun
mix
weapon
and
thing
that
can
be
use
a
one
what
i
meant
wa
that
car
can
kill
but
they
are
not
gun
someon
said
that
if
we
ban
gun
wed
have
to
ban
car
to
becaus
they
kill
to
i
dont
think
we
should
argu
on
thi
one
the
issu
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agre
that
the
crimin
are
the
main
problem
gun
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
use
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
thi
discus
is
interest
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapon
it
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innoc
peopl
the
problem
is
human
not
gun
if
of
all
murder
wa
done
with
ax
would
you
impos
some
regul
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
use
at
tree
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
it
the
axer
an
exampl
dont
flame
me
just
becaus
not
exactli
are
kill
by
gun
think
about
the
situat
in
lo
angel
where
peopl
are
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
is
thi
a
good
situat
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
if
everybodi
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
from
crimin
and
their
neighbor
who
have
gun
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybodi
had
a
gun
in
usa
dont
flame
the
englishman
becaus
of
northern
irland
they
have
gun
control
that
work
in
england
and
fond
from
usa
are
one
of
the
reason
whi
ira
can
bomb
innoc
someth
about
throw
stone
in
glass
hous
dont
flame
them
becaus
of
what
to
three
child
did
either
can
an
jugoslav
have
an
oppinion
on
