oh
i

what
your
question

whi
dont
you
read
the

jame
madison
federalist
paper
regard
the
gener
welfar
claus
noth
is
more
natur
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
gener
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualifi
it
by
a
recit
of
particular
but
what
doe
madison
know
about
the
grammat
style
of
the
nd
he
onli
wrote
it
the
amend
also
impli
that
the
right
to
arm
ha
to
due
with
the
secur
of
a
free
state
the
federalist
paper
mention
of
a
well
regul
militia
give
mani
exampl
of
how
thi
militia
protect
the
secur
of
a
free
state
all
these
exampl
are
action
of
a
veri
organ
forc
not
some
john
q
public
with
a
gun
that
obvious
becaus
youv
never
actual
read
the
federalist
paper
all
that
the
second
amend
clearli
state
to
me
is
that
the
peopl
right
to
form
well
regul
militia
shall
not
be
infring
that
is
peopl
have
the
right
to
join
a
well
organ
militia
thi
well
organ
militia
will
of
cours
provid
train
in
how
to
use
arm
and
in
basic
militari
tactic
these
train
member
of
the
militia
can
keep
and
bear
the
arm
cant
read
huh
show
me
where
the
document
say
well
organ
militia
lastli
read
through
the
federalist
paper
on
well
organ
militia
it
is
veri
clear
that
mani
of
the
reason
for
these
militia
one
reason
state
is
the
protect
from
a
stand
armi
these
day
the
stand
armi
could
easili
defeat
a
group
consist
of
everi
year
old
male
and
femal
not
in
the
armi
forc
that
is
exactli
whi
everi
person
should
be
allow
to
own
ani
weapon
current
in
use
in
the
arm
forc
anoth
reason
state
for
well
organ
militia
is
to
reduc
the
need
for
a
stand
armi
well
the
u
armi
forc
have
been
a
stand
armi
for
more
than
half
the
histori
of
the
u
but
the
major
reason
is
to
protect
against
that
veri
same
armi
it
seem
to
me
the
whole
reason
for
the
second
amend
to
give
the
peopl
protect
from
the
u
govern
by
guarante
that
the
peopl
can
over
through
the

if
necessari
is
a
littl
bit
of
an
