although
le
appar
to
those
who
have
not
research
the
fact
person
protect
is
a
legitim
a
reason
a
sport
for
the
privat
citizen
to
own
a
gun
the
most
recent
research
is
that
of
dr
gari
kleck
of
the
florida
state
univers
school
of
criminolog
he
found
that
handgun
are
more
often
use
by
victim
to
defeat
crime
than
by
crimin
to
commit
it
v
respect
in
thi
studi
these
figur
are
even
more
encourag
when
you
consid
the
number
of
crime
that
never
occur
becaus
of
the
presenc
of
a
gun
in
the
hand
of
a
lawabid
privat

found
that

believ
that

arm
and
agre
that
most
crimin
are
more
worri
about
meet
an
arm
victim
than
they
are
about
run

one
of
the
most
heinou
of
crime
is
that

observ
that
