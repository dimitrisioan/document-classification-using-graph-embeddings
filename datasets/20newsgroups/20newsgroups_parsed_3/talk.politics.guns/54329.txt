ani
idea
about
the
size
of
waco
im
just
curiou
becaus
if
it
were
a
small
town
that
may
have
someth
to
do
with
it
possibl
not
it
sure
didnt
take
it
veri
long
to
burn
down
though
i
wa
watch
abc
and
it
onli
took
like
a
littl
over
minut
to
burn
down
waco
is
a
citi
of
about
peopl
the
popul
temporarili
rais
to
about
peopl
when
all
the
fed
and
state
polic
offic
arriv
i
tell
you
what
i
stay
in
a
hotel
room
about
mile
from
the
bd
compound
around
week
ago
i
have
never
felt
more
paranoid
in
my
whole
life
there
were
at
least
state
polic
in
the
hotel
the
claim
we
had
the
water
turn
off
so
the
fire
engin
had
to
bring
their
own
doesnt
hold
up
if
they
had
cut
off
the
water
they
sure
could
have
turn
it
back
on
just
a
quickli
they
just
didnt
want
to
there
were
some
score
to
settl
messag
to
anybodi
els
is
veri
clear
dont
fuck
with
u
we
will
do
you
in
not
that
i
am
one
to
believ
that
everyth
that
the
govern
tell
u
is
true
but
if
that
wa
the
messag
they
want
to
send
whi
did
they
wait
day
i
think
the
messag
would
be
better
sent
by
charg
in
there
right
away
not
wait
for
day
and
pound
them
with
sound
etc
a
bunch
of
dead
bd
member
are
not
go
to
be
so
abl
to
tell
their
side
of
the
stori
so
now
all
we
have
is
the
stori
accord
to
the
batf
and
fbi
also
mr
care
about
the
right
of

fbi
said
the
ga
mask
use
by
the
bd
have
a
finit
life
and
were
close
to
run
out
whi

there
are
peopl
supposedli
aliv
they
can
tell
their
stori
a
far
a
bill
clinton
is
concern
dont
you
think
he
ha
more
press
matter
to
attend
to
besid
some
small
group
of
peopl
in
texa
how
about
bosnia
now
there
a
problem
whi
couldnt
they
have
wait
they
wait
too
long
a
it
is
someth
should
have
been
done
earlier
they
gov
is
tri
to
say
it
wa
a
mass
suicid
in
the
past
they
had
express
thi
wa
a
real
possibl
but
now
they
decid
it
wasnt
a
possibl
so
they
could
go
on
with
the
raid
apparantli
what
they
feel
korash
wa
or
wa
not
capabl
of
or
go
to
do
wa
driven
by
what
wa
most
conveni
at
the
time
now
thi
mean
that
the
public
and
medium
will
forget
about
all
thi
have
becom
weari
of
it
thi
ha
alreadi
happen
for
mani
peopl
there
will
be
no
investig
independ
or
otherwis
or
a
whitewash
veri
much
a
possibl
there
will
be
no
unseal
of
the
warrant
and
relat
document
what
anybodi
will
know
about
thi
incid
will
be
the
batf
version
with
the
way
our
govern
is
i
wouldnt
doubt
it
the
batf
ha
just
been
given
cart
blanch
for
further
abus
with
the
effect
support
and
approv
of
the
administr
clinton
said
on
the
news
that
he
knew
about
what
wa
happen
but
that
it
wa
all
in
the
hand
of
the
fbi
that
is
if
you
choos
to
believ
the
medium
there
will
be
more
abus
with
no
concern
of
administr
censur
the
precid
ha
been
establish
that
the
fed
can
kill
in
quantiti
to
achiev
their
aim
especi
if
the
target
is
excercis
their
right
under
the
second
amend
and
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
right
and
is
a
governmentdeclar
unnic
fellow
if
they
had
rocket
launcher
and
such
a
the
press
and
gov
claim
whi
shouldnt
they
have
done
someth
what
possibl
use
would
a
religi
cult
have
for
a
rocket
launcher
also
is
child

then
there

probabl
a
lot
of

in

im
sure
they
feel
the
same
way
god
bless
america
land
of
the
free
past
tens
well
mayb
i
am
overreact
but
i
see
on
the
tv
a
i
am
type
where
mayb
mayb
not
there
are
a
lot
of
question
that
should
be
rais
about
thi
incid
the
problem
is
who
will
do
it
and
be
heard
govt
spoksewoman
the
new
attorney
gener
known
to
be
almost
rabid
about
privat
ownership
of
gun
want
to
ban
assault
gun
and
just
about
everyth
els
is
say
the
fbi
had
amaz
restraint
then
fall
back
into
the
offici
goveren
line
about
how
the
bd
were
guiti
of
child
abus
and
were
into
it
in
an
ongo
basi
and
so
on
note
that
accord
to
the
liber
elit
give
a
child
a
spank
is
regard
a
child
abus
serious
if
it
get
known
the
state
can
take
your
child
away
from
you
if
you
spank
your
kid
she
also
is
say
which
state
is
that
the
feder
govern
or
an
individu
state
govern
clinton
person
approv
thi
oper
she
told
him
it
wa
appropri
and
so
on
and
he
said
ok
do
it
somehow
i
am
not
surpris
the
peopl
must
know
who
is
bo
who
is
in
charg
and
it
is
obviouli
no
longer
the
peopl
it
seem
to
me
that
the
peopl
havent
been
in
charg
for
a
long
time
if
they
realli
were
i
dont
think
the
govern
would
be
do
a
mani
thing
a
it
ha
in
the
past
and
i
maintain
the
appropri
respons
a
far
a
thi
raid
by
batf
is
concern
regard
child
abus
is
so
what
batf
are
not
our
child
protect
servic
polic
yet
after
all
the
bd
had
been
tri
on
that
charg
befor
and
found
not
guilti
the
govt
peopl
have
pretti
much
gone
silent
on
the
terribl
illeg
gun
bd
supposedli
ha
and
stress
the
continu
child
abus
apparantli
to
make
it
a
seem
a
sort
of
a
rescu
oper
figur
everyon
hate
child
abus
and
anyth
is
ok
to
use
against
them
occasion
refer
to
ammunit
posses
by
the
bd
and
so
on
is
irrelev
it
is
not
illeg
to
have
ammunit
yet
true
but
is
it
illeg
to
have
a
rocket
launcher
am
i
have
a
vain
hope
that
an
honest
investig
will
occur
on
thi
thing
or
will
it
simpli
be
whitewash
under
the
rug
and
busi
a
usual
will
continu
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
in
the
new
order
who
will
be
given
the
offici
titl
of
thought
polic
i
wonder
and
if
clinton
and
friend
have
their
way
highli
like
at
thi
point
the
new
order
govern
will
also
have
all
the
gun
so
what
if
is
go
to
be
ten
year
late
i
think
we
are
go
to
discov
that
we
will
be
pay
dearli
for
put
thi
fellow
in

for
decad
to

even
some
diehard

are
have
seriou
doubt
about
their

shit
if
peopl
dont
get
what
they
want
right
away
there
is
an
instant
problem
clinton
