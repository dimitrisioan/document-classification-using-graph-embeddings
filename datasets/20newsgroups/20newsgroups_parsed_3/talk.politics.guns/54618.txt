tha
there
is
no
evid
of

but
hope
if
there
is
ani
effect
it
may
prevent
injuri
or
death
in
one
of
these
type
of
common
incid
say
hope
the
effect
of
polici
x
will
be
y
is
much
differ
from
say
hope
if
there
is
ani
effect
of
polici
x
it
will
be
y
here
youv
made
both
statement
if
the
former
describ
a
reasonablylik
outcom
of
polici
x
then
perhap
polici
x
is
worthi
of
consider
but
the
latter
statement
is
not
someth
to
base
polici
decis
on
firearm
are
the
fifthlead
caus
of
unintent
death
among
child
age
and
under
accord
to
group
like
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violenc
formerli
the
nation
coalit
to
ban
handgun
interest
name
chang
dont
you
think
who
includ
murder
and
suicid
by
firearm
in
the
lead
caus
of
unintent
death
figur
but
dont
includ
murder
and
suicid
by
other
mean
a
caus
of
unintent
death
cant
you
see
past
the
bullshit
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accident
death
is
import
so
gun
dont
kill
a
mani
child
a
car
accid
what
is
the
differ
in
sever
between
death
and
death
i
am
not
tri
to
use
accident
gunrel
death
among
child
a
a
justif
for
gun
control
who
need
to
be
convinc
that
accident
gun
death
of
child
is
a
seriou
problem
i
assum
that
ani
human
person
would
be
concern
when
ani
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parent
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accid
blew
away
one
of
their
friend
certainli
accident
death
by
ani
caus
are
seriou
thing
but
the
antigun
group
insist
over
and
over
again
that
accident
death
by
firearm
is
a
stastic
seriou
problem
and
even
if
you
dont
use
these
death
a
a
justif
for
gun
control
these
group
do
im
sorri
if
i
jump
to
conclus
about
your
reason
for
mention
accident
death
due
to
firearm
be
someth
that
warrant
concern
but
in
light
of
your
statement
that
you
are
a
staunch
support
of
gun
control
measur
i
think
the
conclus
wa
a
reason
one
the
fact
remain
that
tragic
though
individu
accident
gun
death
may
be
they
are
not
a
seriou
problem
statist
speak
plea
explain
whi
you
think
symbol
offer
do
good
my
point
wa
gun
buyback
program
which
are
almost
alway
run
by
polic
depart
might
i
stress
might
do
a
littl
i
stress
littl
good
by
give
peopl
the
impress
that
the
polic
are
attempt
to
respond
to
interperson
gun
violenc
in
a
uniqu
way
overal
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
program
were
use
sorri
if
it
wasnt
clear
to
me
i
thought
you
were
waffl
on
your
view
of
buyback
program
with
the
talk
of
symbol
offer
and
hope
prevent
accid
and
heatofpass
shoot
i
have
to
disagre
on
all
these
count
i
cant
understand
how
a
buy
gun
from
peopl
who
arent
intend
to
misus
them
obvious
those
who
want
to
use
gun
to
commit
crime
arent
go
to
turn
them
in
could
be
constru
a
a
posit
way
for
polic
to
respond
to
interperson
violenc
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherev
you
saw
these
statist
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
care
that
is
the
number
of
student
estim
to
have
carri
a
weapon
not
necessarili
a
gun
to
school
at
least
onc
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
student
who
carri
a
gun
to
school
daili
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violenc
what
the
peopl
who
publish
figur
say
that
a
mani
child
commit
suicid
by
handgun
alon
each
year
a
the
fbi
say
commit
suicid
by
all
method
per
year
who
do
you
think
i
should
believ
the
peopl
who
call
everyon
up
to
age
child
when
theyr
scream
about
the
carnag
of
our
nation
child
be
caus
by
handgun
or
the
center
for
diseas
control
ah
ye
the
agenc
that
consid
accident
shoot
of
child
to
be
such
a
statist
problem
that
a
state
object
in
the
healthi
peopl
document
is
to
enact
law
in
state
requir
manufactur
of
handgun
to
make
the
handgun
more
difficult
to

minim
the
likelihood
of

ye
they
actual
gave
u
a
number
on
the
basi
of
a
look
at
the
number
of

rather
than
the
rate

it
wasnt
their
fault
that
the
popul
of
dc
drop
in
their
post

period
if
you
look
care
you
will
see
that
you
greatli
underestim
the
presenc
of

the
fuse
box
the

the
knive
the

if
everyth
back
to
normal
what
wrong
with
thi
pictur
okay
mayb
i
word
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
child
in
a
situat
fortifi
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
say
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
child
directli
but
i
would
hope
that
whatev
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innoc
child
die
i
dont
think
koresh
wa
the
messiah
either
but
isnt
it
obviou
that
if
he
believ
the
forc
of
evil
were
come
to
destroy
him
then
he
believ
the
child
were
much
safer
insid
the
compound
i
didnt
say
he
wa
sane
just
that
he
behav
in
a
pretti
ration
manner
given
what
he
thought
wa
go
on
he
thought
he
had
them
in
the
one
place
where
harm
wouldnt
come
to
them
if
a
he
claim
he
wa
the
messiah
and
peopl
follow
him
a
such
whi
did
he
not
tell
their
parent
to
free
the
child
instead
of
let
them
burn
aliv
let
see
you
tri
to
find
the
exit
unbarricad
them
and
flee
a
fire
when
youv
been
kept
awak
for
most
of
