will
tell
you
that
you
are
far
more
like
have
your
gun
stolen
use
it
yourself
on
a
famili
member
or
have
it
use
on
you
than
you
are
to
use
it
on
an
actual
crimin
actual
they
wont
what
theyll
tell
you
is
that
if
you
add
up
the
number
of
suicid
murder
of
one
drug
dealer
by
anoth
legit
selfdefens
of
a
batter
spous
and
so
on
youll
end
up
with
a
number
that
is
much
larger
than
the
number
of
selfdefens
kill
against
stranger
commit
in
the
bedroom
btw
they
didnt
honestli
count
the
latter
either
but
let
not
quibbl
they
tri
to
claim
that
comparison
is
between
the
cost
of
selfdefens
and
the
benefit
but
theyr
wrong
thi
comparison
doesnt
measur
the
cost
of
selfdefens
and
it
doesnt
measur
the
benefit
either
for
exampl
the
goal
is
not
to
kill
the
attack
whatev
your
relationship
to
him
but
to
stop
him
while
the
number
of
kill
may
be
proport
to
the
number
of
stop
it
isnt
equal
anyon
who
confus
that
comparison
with
an
honest
evalu
is
either
lie
or
andi
