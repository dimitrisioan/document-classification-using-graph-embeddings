no
survivor
in
articl
bill
green
write
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
seriou
discuss
of
thi
incid
i
believ
the
move
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problem
with
some
of
the
tactic
after
watch
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
a
well
a
cnn
and
nightlin
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
action
my
god
a
sane
person
somebodi
ask
intellig
question
rather
than
spout
of
unsubstanti
drivel
and
make
comparison
to
nazi
germani
i
question
along
with
other
the
initi
raid
by
the
atf
there
are
some
definit
question
need
answer
could
it
have
been
possibl
to
have
taken
koresh
outsid
the
compound
at
some
time
befor
the
feb
th
raid
probabl
which
is
whi
there
are
so
mani
peopl
angri
at
the
initi
confront
whi
attack
a
compound
with
a
mani
peopl
in
that
compound
who
are
will
to
die
for
their
leader
further
they
attack
in
the
daylight
hour
without
proper
backup
medic
support
etc
that
wa
rather
stupid
could
a
further
wait
have
result
in
a
differ
outcom
thi
i
doubt
while
i
question
the
atf
initi
raid
i
believ
that
the
remaind
of
the
standoff
wa
handl
fairli
well
with
the
singl
except
of
the
psycholog
warfar
by
blare
music
etc
i
think
that
wa
uncal
for
and
probabl
hinder
the
outcom
were
fbi
action
blare
loudspeak
etc
the
right
cours
of
action
see
abov
and
a
few
other
question
like
i
said
i
believ
the
action
taken
in
gener
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reserv
agre
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
ball
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
respons
seem
like
the
waffl
boy
had
problem
figur
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issu
which
is
actual
rather
refresh
nowaday
most
of
the
time
the
higherup
claim
i
dont
rememb
