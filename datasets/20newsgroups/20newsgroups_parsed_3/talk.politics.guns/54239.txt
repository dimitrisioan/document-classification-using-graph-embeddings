a
short
thought
when
you
ask
the
question
of

whether
they
will
check
for
stolen
weapon
and
they
answer
no
it
total
amnesti
pleas
note
that
the
given
for
each
firearm
in
the
boston
buy
back
will
not
be
in
cash
but
money
order
how
much
total
amnesti
can
you
get
if
you
leav
paper
trail
behind
in
the
latest
case

a
far
a
traceabl
a
a
practic
matter
i
dont

it
would
depend
on
whether

the
recipi
name
is
on
the
money
order
and
bother
key
that
sort
of
thing

certainli
the
polic
and
the

peopl
would
keep
a
record
of
who
they
gave

out
to
is
that
even
an
issu
if
