i
suppos
that
true
if
you
maintain
that
ak
and
ar
are
hunt
weapon
i
think
they
are
fun
to
plink
canstargetsrandom
vc
with
but
not
suitabl
for
real
hunt
wrong
both
are
legal
to
hunt
with
here
in
kentucki
i
have
a
pictur
of
a
friend
with
a
nice
point
buck
which
he
shot
with
hi
ar
rifl
i
dont
think
mani
deer
hunter
would
condon
your
friend
choic
of
rifl
i
must
agre
with
nathan
a
a
deer
hunter
i
find
it
inhuman
to
use
underpow
weapon
for
deer
hunt
to
kill
cleanli
with
the
littl
requir
extrem
good
marksmanship
most
hunt
situat
dont
allow
for
perfect
shot
hunter
should
use
suffici
power
weapon
to
drop
the
deer
with
a
singl
hit
to
the
chest
the
x
from
the
ak
or
sk
is
adequ
to
thi
task
have
similar
ballist
to
the
familiar
but
the
littl
is
veri
margin
in
the
hand
of
the
expert
or
the
lucki
it
will
do
but
hunter
realli
should
have
more
respect
for
their
quarri
gari
ill
agre
that
the
popular
gr
load
for
rem
is
too
small
for
deersiz
game
howev
if
you
use
a
gr
semispritz
or
the
sierra
gr
semipoint
bullet
thi
would
be
suitabl
like
ani
round
you
keep
your
shot
within
a
reason
rang
it
would
still
be
on
the
lower
end
of
what
id
consid
accept
perform
especi
those
long
distanc
shot
out
west
hunt
monster
mule
deer
the
rem
ha
been
declar
legal
for
deer
hunt
in
oklahoma
the
is
excel
for
varmit
hunt
and
pest
control
the
ar
in
particular
is
well
suit
given
it
heavi
barrel
and
heat
shield
foregrip
add
a
highpow

and
your
in
dog
heaven
howev
i
dont
think
nathan
janett
wa
refer
to
the
specif
chamber
of
the
rifl
in
question
mayb
he
think
self
load
rifl
have
no
place
in
deer
hunt
that
may
or
may
not
be
hi
opinion
but
mani
sportsman
do
use
self
load
rifl
and
shotgun
wrongo
nra
man
i
wa
definit
refer
to
the
round
not
the
autoload
aspect
of
the
rifl
i
have
no
problem
with
respons
hunt
that
doesnt
includ
machin
gun
from
chopper
but
a
semi
is
fine
my
uncl
ha
bag
sever
deer
with
gaug
slug
i
would
prefer
that
a
hunter
use
a
much
of
the
catch
a
possibl
and
i
dont
condon
hunt
for
sport
onli
imho
of
cours
two
question
you
assert
that
both
the
ar
and
ak
are
not
suitabl
for
real
hunt
if
you
have
no
problem
with
hunt
or
use
self
load
rifl
for
hunt
whi
did
you
say
thi
if
not
for
deer
then
what
about
other
smaller
game
when
did
i
get
