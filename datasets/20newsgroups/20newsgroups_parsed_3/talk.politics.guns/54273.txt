subject
re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
in
articl
thoma
parsli
write
if
i
would
like
to
have
a
handgun
i
would
have
to
get
an
gunlic
from
the
polic
and
to
be
a
member
of
a
gunclub
the
polic
would
check
my
crimin
record
for
ani
seriou
crime
andor
record
of
seriou
mental
diseas
now
if
a
got
my
licenc
i
would
have
to
be
an
activ
member
of
the
gun
club
for
month
befor
i
could
collect
my
gun
so
like
what
do
you
do
dure
those
six
month
to
be
activ
my
town
ha
a
similar
requir
and
it
rather
stupid
befor
you
can
buy
a
handgun
you
have
to
be
an
activ
member
of
a
gun
club
well
how
activ
can
you
be
without
a
gun
chief
most
gun
owner
feel
a
check
of
crimin
record
for
crime
and
mental
disord
would
be
a
veri
good
thing
if
it
couldnt
be
abus
by
the
govern
but
everi
time
thi
is
propos
there
is
alway
some
trapdoor
by
which
the
govern
can
deni
your
purchas
even
if
you
are
perfectli
qualifi
to
own
a
gun
and
we
oppos
thi
it
a
littl
like
get
a
driver
licenc
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
befor
you
are
allow
to
sinc
the
fatal
accid
rate
for
licens
automobil
driver
in
the
u
is
around
time
the
fatal
accid
rate
of
larg
unlicens
gun
owner
id
think
twice
befor
use
thi
analog
besid
the
problem
is
crimin
use
of
gun
not
accid
there
are
about
crimin
us
of
gun
in
the
u
everi
year
but
onli
accid
i
dont
think
it
necessari
to
spend
a
lot
of
energi
make
sure
a
crimin
can
shoot
a
gun
befor
he
get
one
just
like
the
check
most
gun
owner
feel
posit
about
requir
safeti
cours
if
they
couldnt
be
abus
by
the
govern
but
they
alreadi
have
one
state
doesnt
hold
the
cours
anoth
doesnt
fund
them
a
third
hold
them
onli
onc
a
year
with
limit
attend
to
those
with
polit
connect
is
thi
fair
most
crimin
accuir
gun
to
use
them
in
crime
and
mostli
short
time
befor
the
crime
and
how
mani
of
them
acquir
these
gun
from
legal
retail
outlet
how
mani
are
borrow
stolen
smuggl
bought
on
the
black
market
use
of
knife
it
is
allow
to
cari
knife
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
american
think
it
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carri
it
open
in
public
rigth
some
state
allow
onli
open
carri
some
allow
onli
conceal
carri
some
allow
both
some
allow
both
but
requir
licens
for
conceal
carri
all
you
can
say
is
if
one
of
these
mode
ha
a
clear
advantag
over
anoth
in
term
of
reduc
crime
or
ani
other
public
good
then
state
legisl
someplac
are
do
exactli
the
wrong
thing
which
mean
that
they
realli
dont
have
ani
object
reason
for
these
law
other
than
their
prefer
a
bad
way
to
govern
scandinavian
are
aggress
we
northen
are
not
a
hotliv
a
southen
but
when
we
decid
to
take
action
we
do
hotliv
i
love
that
express
here
we
say
hothead
individu
v
mass
ye
the
individu
is
more
import
than
the

but
onli
to
some
extent
your
crimin
law
are
to
protect
the
individu
who
make
the

what
happen
when
the
rigth
of
some

the
rest
of

crimin
affect
the
right
of
onli
one
or
a
few
peopl
at
a
time
and
they
do
thi
dure
the
commiss
of
a
crime
possess
of
a
gun
by
someon
hurt
no
one
els
it
is
when
they
do
someth
violent
with
that
gun
that
the
crime
occur
of
cours
it
is
a
crime
for
a
felon
or
exfelon
to
poss
a
gun
but
we
dont
feel
it
is
right
to
treat
common
citizen
who
have
live
good
life
a
if
they
were
just
prefelon
wait
to
commit
crime
we
shouldnt
mix
weapon
and
item
that
can
serv
a
one
i
dont
understand
thi
sentenc
if
i
live
in
amerika
i
would
probabl
have
a
gun
to
defend
myself
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
life
isnt
fair
i
shouldnt
need
a
fire
extinguish
either
or
flood
and
theft
insur
or
to
lock
the
door
of
my
hous
and
car
but
pine
for
a
better
world
wont
do
anyth
to
address
what
i
have
to
do
to
live
in
thi
one
do
you
think
it
wise
to
sell
gun
like
candi
some
state
do
none
of
our
im
sure
if
you

you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy

not
sure
i
know
what
good
a
driver
licens
doe
anyon
either
the
peopl
who
drive
safe
never
use
it
and
the
peopl
who
drive
drunk
drive
without

howev
a
car
is
a
good
tool
but
not
one
that
protect
my
right
to

i
rank
the
right
to
