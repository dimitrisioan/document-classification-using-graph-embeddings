ani
gun
that
enter
a
nation
park
must
be
seal
i
think
it
a
small
metal
tag
that
place
over
the
trigger
the
net
result
of
thi
is
that
you
cant
use
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
from
bear
or
psycho
in
the
nation
park
instead
one
ha
to
be
sensit
to
the
danger
and
annoy
of
hike
in
bear
countri
and
take
the
appropri
precaut
i
think
thi
polici
make
the
user
of
the
nation
park
feel
a
littl
closer
to
natur
that
they
are
a
part
of
natur
and
a
such
have
to
deal
with
natur
on
it
own
term
