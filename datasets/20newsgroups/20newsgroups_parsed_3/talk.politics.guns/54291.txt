weapon
and
the

long
frank
crari
write
down
to
some
odd
line
we
must
be
make
progress
on
an
iron
note
where
i
delet

emac
continu
gave
me
the
messag
garbag
collect
done
think
it
tri
to
tell
me
someth
dan
sorenson
write
and
thank
you
it
a
great
chang
from
the
same
tire
old
debat
you
lurker
can
join
in
at
ani
time
you
know
ahhh
talkpoliticsgun
the
kindler
gentler
newsgroup
who
would
have
thought
no
not
exactli
the
onli
reason
for
thi
sort
of
restrict
is
the
possibl
endanger
of
other
a
poorli
maintain
rifl
is
danger
but
onli
to
the
user
sinc
it
doesnt
endang
other
there
is
no
justif
for
such
restrict
i
remind
you
of
shrapnel
i
consid
a
reason
space
limit
but
make
no
mistak
a
gun
blow
up
is
a
hazard
to
those
nearbi
say
in
the
next
lane
at
the
rang
my
point
wa
at
what
distanc
or
level
of
threat
we
draw
the
line
is
it
the
endanger
of
other
so
we
do
a
restrict
or
the
possibl
of
be
shot
henc
we
draw
a
mile
restrict
or
a
nuke
and
draw
a
mile
restrict
to
me
they
al
suffer
from
the
fundament
flaw
that
they
restrict
base
upon
the
instrument
rather
than
place
the
respons
for
usag
squar
upon
the
shoulder

would

my

all
of
them
the
balanc
act
here
is
hard
to
judg
sit
at
my
desk
there
is
howev
anoth
problem
in
ani
case
of
civil
war
the
strength
of
the
militia
fight
on
each
side
should
reflect
the
popular
will
if
the
public
is
split
versu
then
the
minor
militia
should
be
at
a
disadvantag
such
a
need
for
popular
support
would
hope
prevent
insurrect
unless
the
peopl
realli
were
behind
the
rebel
but
heavi
weapon
own
by
a
small
fraction
of
the
militia
could
distort
thi
what
if
the
minor
includ
all
the
tank
and
artilleri
owner
that
seem
to
be
the
case
alreadi
given
that
heavi
weapon
arent
commonli
own
by
the
citizenri
with
such
low
number
obvious
due
to
cost
i
dont
think
the
superior
weapon
are
go
to
be
of
great
effect
against
a
numer
superior
foe
furthermor
it
is
even
more
doubt
their
train
includ
proper
tactic
movement
that
best
util
tank
wherea
the
commonli
rifleman
is
not
so
hamper
in
effect
i
think
it
is
vital
to
avoid
such
a
situat
where
a
small
minor
would
have
a
reason
chanc
of
gain
polit
power
through
violenc
to
prevent
thi
it
may
be
necessari
to
give
control
of
heavi
weapon
eg
those
which
onli
a
small
number
of
individu
would
own
and
whose
firepow
would
grossli
distort
the
relat
between
popular
support
and
militari
strength
to
someon
other
that
individu
militiaman
thi
is
certainli
not
a
good
thing
but
i
think
it
is
the
lesser
of
two
evil
whoever
control
these
weapon
must
be
a
democrat
bodi
respons
to
the
will
of
the
peopl
i
had
envis
that
the
armor
perhap
the
offic
of
a
select
group
and
the
like
would
exercis
control
over
the
heavier
more
complex
weapon
but
if
joe
bob
own
an
old
sherman
tank
i
certainli
wouldnt
ask
him
to
give
it
up
follow
order
from
the
offic
ye
sinc
the
expens
of
a
tank
is
so
larg
though
chanc
are
it
would
be
jointli
purchas
and
should
therefor
be
jointli
maintain
and
oper
here
i
think
we
have
to
be
careful
about
which
state
we
are
talk
about
certainli
one
role
of
the
militia
is
to
overthrow
a
repress
govern
and
it
would
be
complet
destruct
to
that
end
for
that
same
govern
to
control
the
militia
arm
but
the
unit
state
have
sever
level
of
govern
each
abl
to
act
independ
but
not
all
like
target
of
rebelion
a
such
rebelion
against
state
and
local
govern
are
veri
unlik
i
think
therefor
that
the
state
or
possibl
local
govern
could
safe
be
allow
to
keep
the
select
militia
heavi
weapon
the
risk
of
abus
while
still
someth
to
consid
is
far
le
than
the
similar
risk
were
the
feder
govern
in
control
thi
ill
agre
with
to
a
point
the
state
have
control
over
the
heavi
weapon
should
not
be
justif
for
the
state
to
have
them
central
locat
keep
them
spread
out
such
that
the
abil
of
the
state
to
lock
them
up
isnt
so
easi
otherwis
i
would
have
to
assum
that
state
control
would
rest
on
the
author
of
the
governor
and
militia
offic
that
is
eaxctli
whi
i
think
they
should
be
remov
the
select
militia
should
privid
the
militia
heavi
weapon
and
highlytrain
specialist
for
the
reason
i
have
outlin
abov
i
think
these
heavi
weapon
tank
artilleri
aircraft
etc
are
better
off
be
kept
by
local
govern
than
by
a
small
number
of
individu
howev
local
govern
shouldnt
be
abl
to
use
the
select
militia
without
the
support
to
the
peopl
ideal
the
gener
militia
under
the
direct
control
of
the
peopl
and
the
select
militia
under
the
direct
of
democrat
local
govern
would
opper
togeth
but
even
in
the
worst
case
the
gener
militia
should
be
abl
to
function
without
the
select
militia
similarli
the
select
militia
should
be
incap
of
action
without
the
aid
of
the
gener
militia
im
have
a
hard
time
see
how
these
heavi
weapon
fairli
few
in
number
could
not
be
easili
wield
by
a
few
peopl
with
govern
support
just
a
you
argu
abov
that
the
weapon
should
be
divvi
up
and
under
democrat
control
so
one
side
doesnt
have
all
of
them
i
cant
see
where
thi
situat
is
allevi
in
have
the
select
militia
hold
all
the
weapon
and
the
unorgan
militia
be
the
infantri
i
think
a
better
mix
is
call
for
but
i
would
argu
that
the
feder
armi
should
reli
upon
the
select
militia
and
the
unorgan
militia
for
the
bulk
of
it
infantri
unit
consid
then
the
effect
of
remov
the
nation
guard
infantri
and
place
the
guard
under
the
control
of
local
govern
the
governmentcontrol
select
militia
could
not
fight
effect
without
infantri
support
provid
by
the
gener
militia
an
inher
infantri
organ
on
the
other
hand
the
gener
militia
could
function
although
at
a
disadvantag
without
the
back
of
local
govern
and
the
select
militia
we
have
to
assum
that
there
would
be
those
who
would
side
with
the
governmentcontrol
forc
and
if
theyv
all
the
equip
an
infantri
forc
x
the
size
would
be
in
troubl
id
like
to
see
that
heavi
stuff
say
tank
offset
by
the
local
troup
have
a
few
s
and
antitank
weapon
in
their
armori
these
would
be
much
more
use
to
infantri
than
the
tank
would
be
when
cost
and
train
requir
are
figur
in
i
suppos
im
quibbl
over
what
constitut
heavi
equip
but
a
mechan
infantri
unit
is
what
build
dike
in
time
of
flood
set
up
disast
relief
citi
and
the
like
i
would
much
rather
see
these
thing
handl
by
the
local
gener
militia
so
would
i
but
the
resourc
often
arent
avail
to
outfit
local
unit
well
enough
thu
we
will
certainli
have
to
call
in
other
and
a
mechan
unit
carri
more
stuff
faster
than
anyth
el
perhap
the
nation
guard
isnt
a
close
to
my
concept
of
the
select
militia
a
i
thought
i
wa
consid
them
to
be
the
heavi
weaponsarmor
arm
of
the
militia
not
the
infantri
arm
of
the
regular

perhap
our
idea
of
heavi

are
differ
i

main

actual
thi
is
what
the
guard
unit
in
iowa
are
current
field
in
some

perhap
it
is
just
my
innat
fear
of
have
the
real
heavi

under
state
control
with
littl
but
number
and
light
stuff
to
act
a
a
deterr
allow
main

the
