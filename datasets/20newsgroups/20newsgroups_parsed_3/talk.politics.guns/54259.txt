the
last
thing
that
should

switch
to
the
onli
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safeti
on
it
sure
there
is
that
littl
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too

all
veri
true
im
go
on
what
i
have
read
and
heard
from
friend
basic
the
glock
is
great
but
i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
learn
proper
handl
becaus
of
the
type
of
safeti
that
it
ha
i
wa
look
at
a
glock
sw
and
the
sw
a
coupl
of
week
ago
and
the
safti
on
the
gun
were
veri
differ
the
saftey
on
the
seem
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
cours
thi
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebodi
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddl
around
turn
the
safeti
off
person
i
like
the
glock
becaus
they
are
veri
light
and
i
think
they
look
realli
cool
guess
that
whi
they
use
them
in
so
mani
movi
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
a
my
first
semiauto
becaus
of
the
safeti
i
would
prefer
more
train
with
a
tradit
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of
cours
that
just
my
opinion
