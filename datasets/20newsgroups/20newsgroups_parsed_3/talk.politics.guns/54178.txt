hi
in
canada
ani
gun
that
enter
a
nation
park
must
be
seal
i
think
it
a
small
metal
tag
that
place
over
the
trigger
the
net
result
of
thi
is
that
you
cant
use
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
from
bear
or
psycho
in
the
nation
park
instead
one
ha
to
be
sensit
to
the
danger
and
annoy
of
hike
in
bear
countri
and
take
the
appropri
precaut
i
think
thi
polici
make
the
user
of
the
nation
park
feel
a
littl
closer
to
natur
that
they
are
a
part
of
natur
and
a
such
have
to
deal
with
natur
on
it
own
term
guy
hello
i
understand
thi
philosophi
the
bear
are
a
nation
treasur
the
area
is
their
sanctuari
and
peopl
who
enter
it
do
so
at
their
own
risk
it
is
better
that
that
rare
human
be
kill
by
a
bear
than
that
bear
be
provok
or
shot
by
unbearsavvi
visitor
the
bear
arent
have
a
popul
explos
human
are
so
it
is
better
that
a
human
be
kill
than
endang
the
bear
i
dont
agre
with
thi
philosopi
but
i
understand
it
the
psycho
are
a
bit
differ
they
are
not
a
nation
treasur
but
i
suppos
the
decis
ha
been
made
that
to
allow
provis
for
defens
against
them
would
also
allow
provis
for
defens
against
bear
again
i
suppos
it
ha
been
decid
that
it
is
better
for
the
rare
human
to
be
kill
by
a
psycho
than
to
take
a
chanc
on
threaten
the
bear
person
i
wouldnt
go
into
an
area
where
i
would
be
manag
so
a
to
reduc
my
safeti
but
come
to
think
of
it
i
guess
i
live
in
a
manag
wilder
myself
