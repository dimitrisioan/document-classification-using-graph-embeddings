jeff
waldeck
write
where
did
you
hear
about
the
thermal
imag
i
havent
heard
thi
yet
not
that
i
doubt
it
im
just
look
for
sourc
thi
wa
report
in
canadian
paper
thursday
april
i
think
the
sourc
wa
upi
but
dont
recal
for
certain
it
seem
to
me
that
if
they
did
have
thi
kind
of
info
they
could
broadcast
it
and
it
would
resolv
or
at
least
help
to
resolv
alot
of
doubt
in
peopl
mind
person
the
way
the
fbibatfrenoetc
is
claim
all
sort
of
thing
without
offer
one
shred
of
proof
other
than
their
good
word
is
veri
suspici
to
me
a
pictur
is
worth
a
thousand
word
i
understand
that
at
least
two
gover
investig
have
been
order
so
we
may
learn
more
dure
their
hear
i
sincer
hope
you
are
right
and
it
turn
out
with
indisput
proof
broadcast
across
our
land
that
the
govern
group
had
noth
to
do
with
the
fire
but
until
i
see
such
proof
i
think
it
is
just
a
like
that
a
tank
did
knock
over
a
lantern
a
koresh
torch
the
place
the
onli
evid
i
have
seen
is
a
tank
crash
through
the
front
wall
withdraw
and
second
later
flame
are
seen
the
first
flame
on
the
video
erupt
from
thi
veri
same
spot
coincid
perhap
tough
call
without
more
investig
but
if
the
thermal
imag
stori
hold
up
i
think
the
govern
will
be
more
credabl
of
cours
paranoia
fan
wont
believ
their
result
anyway
will
they
if
such
proof
exist
the
govern
should
publish
it
and
put
all
thi
specul
to
rest
hear
hear
id
also
like
to
see
the
autopsi
report
confirm
news
report
that
multipl
victim
were
found
shot
in
the
head
and
in
posit
inconsist
with
fire
victim
it
is
simpli
too
earli
to
draw
conclus
either
way
about
thi
nasti
incid
but
i
tend
to
believ
the
govern
side
the
old
frog
almanac
a
salut
to
that
old
