it

to

in
your

is
that
thi
low

area
is
suffici
low
a
to
make

unprofit
on
what
do
you
base
thi
and
given

given

id
be

that
a

becaus
theyd
have

search
everi

which
came
through
it
not
simpli
a
matter
of
how
much
money
are
they
worth
but
how
much
more
money
are
they
worth
than
other
good
base
on
the
