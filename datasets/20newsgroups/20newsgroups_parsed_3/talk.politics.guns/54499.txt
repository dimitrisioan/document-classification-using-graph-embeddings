re
batffbi
murder
almost
everyon
in
waco
today
in
scott
w
robi
write
and
i
suppos
the
fbi
also
prevent
them
from
come
out
with
their
hand
up
while
nation
tv
camera
watch
would
you
have
come
out
if
you
knew
the
onli
nation
tv
camera
were
well
over
a
mile
away
and
yet
the
agent
with
the
gun
were
onli
a
few
yard
away
they
had
contact
with
a
lawyer
so
i
am
inclin
to
believ
they
had
an
idea
of
what
their
situat
actual
wa
thi
also
lead
to
the
conspiraci
theori
that
the
lawyer
had
the
batf
pin
on
right
violat
if
the
bd
act
a
wit
henc
the
arson
i
doubt
that
one
too
but
it
is
still
quit
clear
that
leav
a
safe
place
to
surrend
is
a
rather
stupid
thing
to
do
until
that
place
is
no
longer
safe
do
you
disbeliev
everyth
the
fbi
say
a
a
matter
of
cours
given
how
theyv
allow
no
other
view
to
be
heard
ill
reserv
judgement
until
the
trial
but
so
far
a
the
fbi
is
concern
their
statement
carri
the
same
amount
of
weight
a
photon
at
rest
the
batf
is
by
no
mean
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handl
of
thi
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intent
start
the
fire
is
ludicr
ludicr
ye
possibl
ye
plausibl
get
the
juri
if
the
fire
were
set
by
accid
or
by
peopl
outsid
the
compound
i
would
have
expect
far
more
cult
member
to
flee
the
compound
or
at
least
come
out
shoot
that
what
get
me
too
it
is
like
the
cult
member
were
hole
up
in
an
enforc
place
insid
the
build
with
a
decent
arson
attempt
i
suspect
mani
of
them
could
have
been
trap
in
addit
the
introduct
of
c
ga
for
sever
hour
would
have
render
mani
of
them
immobil
if
not
unconsci
when
their
mask
quit
all
the
prop
are
there
but
prove
what
scene
wa
play
is
difficult
the
onli
certainti
is
that
the
fbi
and
batf
have
few
wit
against
them
