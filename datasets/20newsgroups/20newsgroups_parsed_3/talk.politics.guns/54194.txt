the

that
it
is
apparantli
accept
for
big

big

to
use
tank
to
control
the
peopl
a

they
dont
use

everyth

i
dont
know
about
the
other
peopl
in
thi
group
or
on
the
net
but
the
idea
of
tank
be
use
to
control
civilian
in
anyth
that
pretend
to
be
a
free
societi
is
outrag
when
big
govern
feel
it
is
necessari
to
use
that
kind
of
forc
to
stomp
out
protest
even
violent
of
the
citizen
that
suggest
that
the
govern
is
total
out
of
control
sinc
that
is
effect
the
govern
declar
war
on
it
own
peopl
if
the
govern
wa
live
up
to
it
respons
govern
of
the
peopl
by
the
peopl
not
the
lord
and
other
elit
who
want
to
keep
their
good
thing
go
the
citizen
wouldnt
feel
the
need
to
be
resort
to
act
that
need
to
be
squash
with
a
militari
boot
peopl
do
thing
like
that
becaus
they
have
becom
convinc
that
it
is
the
onli
option
that
remain
other
attempt
to
have
grievanc
redress
have
been
ignor
and
ye
there
is
a
crimin
element
that
will
exploit
thi
but
the
fact
remain
that
the
govern
ha
been
unrespons
or
such
act
wouldnt
be
apt
to
happen
still
not
an
excus
to
open
up
on
civilian
with
tank
heavi
machin
gun
or
whatev
it
the
old
might
make
right
philosophi
that
is
the
hallmark
of
a
govern
go
rogu
they
dont
like
it
tough
we
will
simpli
squash
them
under
an
iron
boot
actual
address
their
grievanc
in
other
than
token
fashion
with
huge
volum
of
hot
air
is
just
too
inconveni
sort
of
a
variat
on
mushroom
manag
keep
them
in
the
dark
smother
them
with
shit
and
crush
them
when
readi
and
these
are
the
folk
that
mani
liber
are
tri
to
arrang
thing
so
that
they
will
have
a
monopoli
on
coerciv
forc
firearm
that
are
than
expens
toy
by
gut
the
bill
of
right
cuz
it
just
isnt
progress
or
doesnt
fit
in
with
modern
think
anymor
unbeliev
and
i
do
believ
amid
the
smoke
confus
etc
of
a
real
riot
situat
that
it
would
be
possibl
for
a
tank
to
get
away
with
fire
the
main
gun
into
a
build
at
close
rang
one
would
hear
an
explos
among
mani
explos
it
is
loud
but
it
is
not
go
to
stand
out
like
a
pound
bomb
or
a
tactic
nuke
there
would
be
a
hole
blown
in
the
wall
and
some
rubbl
but
with
tank
knock
over
wall
and
other
sourc
of
build
turn
into
rubbl
and
other
cover
racket
such
a
gunfir
includ
s
tack
away
it
would
not
stand
out
that
much
and
could
be
explain
by
musta
been
a
ga
leak
i
think
it
could
be
done
and
not
be
report
under
such
condit
it
is
possibl
it
is
not
like
a
tank
drive
down
a
quiet
street
on
a
sunday
afternoon
turn
and
fire
you
know
that
would
stand
out
