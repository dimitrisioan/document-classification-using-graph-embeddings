point
wa
gun
buyback
program

littl
i
stress

give
peopl
the
impress
that
the
polic
are
attempt
to
respond
to
interperson
gun
violenc
in
a
uniqu
way
overal
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that

buyback
program
were
use
i
do
know
that
the
vast
major
of
gun
that
are
use
by
youth
or
brought
to
school
by
youth
on
a
daili
basi
about
youth
are
obtain
easili
and
quickli
through
a
person
friend
or
more
often
borrow
from
a
parent
without

knowledg
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherev
you
saw
these
statist
i
suspect
youll
find
if

look
care
that
is

to
have
carri
a
weapon
not
necessarili
a

past
year
and
not
the
number
of
student
who
carri
a
gun
to

daili
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violenc
or
the
center
for
diseas
control
if
you
look
care
you
will
see
that

underestim
the
presenc
of

of
youth
the
cphv
report
that
youth
bring
gun
to

daili
and
that
bring
gun
to
school
at
least
onc
a
year
the
cdc
estim
that
out
f
high
school
student
carri
a
gun
to

at
least
onc
in
the
cdc
also
say
that
million
elementaryag
latchkey
child
kid

between
amd
these
are
the
statist
thu
will
to
follow
a
man
who
claim
to
be
the
messiah
got
news
for
you
folk
if
the
big
chees
wa
on
thi
crazi
planet
of
our
present
he
would
not
be
carri
a
gun
or
hold
child
when
they
were
in
danger
hold
kid
time
for
a
realiti
check
son
these
kid
were
the
child
of
the
peopl
insid
who
believ
that
the
forc
of
evil
were
outsid
wait
to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
child
out
the
door
if
you
believ

they
did
okay
mayb
i
word
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
child
in
a
situat
fortifi
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
say
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
child
directli
but
i
would
hope
that
whatev
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innoc
child
die
if
a
he
claim
he
wa
the
messiah
and
peopl

such
whi
did
