i
dont
know
about
the
paranoia
and
irration
but
the
rest
is
pretti
close
all
though
you
left
out
the
inabl
to
breath
of
cours
you
can
make
a
claim
that
peopl
will
do
some
fairli
derang
thing
to
get
away
from
it
ive
seen
teenag
flatten
lb
drill
sergeant
to
get
out
of

full
of

show
the
result
all
the
earlier
thi
is
the
stuff
janet
reno
wa
told
would
be
safe
for
child
what
they
didnt
mention
is
that
in

open
it
probabl
wouldnt
do
too
much
harm
to

although
i
wouldnt
use
it
in
