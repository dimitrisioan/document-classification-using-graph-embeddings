write
that
realli
depend
upon
where
you
draw
the
line
while
defin
these
weapon
thi
mean
you
would
support
a
ban
if
it
were
narrow
enough
good
veri
narrow
veri

narrow
if
youll
recal
i
wa
the
nut
that
advoc
the
possibl
of
tactic
nuke
be
militia
weapon
in
certain
situat
how
can
you
possibl
defin
what
is
a
weapon
and
what
isnt
is
onli
the
start
of
thi
and
also
on
if
you
intend
the
law
to
be
reflect
of
modern
practic
five
month
or
five
centuri
down
the
road
i
would
hope
so
let
defin
a
nuclear
weapon
a
an
explos
weapon
whose
major
of
energi
come
from
fission
andor
fusion
of
atom
nucleus
and
youv
just
describ
ani
civilian
reactor
becaus
your
definit
fail
to
note
what
energi
is
be
consid
reactor
blow
with
a
steam
explos
but
the
major
of
energi
still
come
from
fission
or
fusion
becaus
that
is
what
heat
the
coolant
see
what
a
can
of
worm
thi
is
last
i
heard
ft
calhoun
station
just
north
of
omaha
nebraska
wasnt
consid
a
weapon
given
the
sodiumcool
breeder
design
on
the
block
now
i
can
easili
envis
reactor
be
household
applianc
in
under
twenti
year
with
the
prism
design
there
is
no
oper
input
need
on
the
reactor
itself
and
it
is
not
unreason
to
assum
the
secondari
side
can
be
made
equal
a
automat
in
the
futur
so
your
definit
is
flaw
in
a
few
respect
alreadi
let
defin
a
biolog
weapon
a
live
organ
or
virus
in
such
state
quantiti
and
with
such
a
vector
that
they
could
caus
death
or
seriou
diseas
further
defin
to
a
signific
number
of
peopl
if
releas
in
a
citi
similarli
popul
area
resevoir
or
cropland
typhoid
mari
would
like
fit
thi
bill
if
she
sneez
if
you
dont
mind
extrapol
ani
hivposit
person
also
fit
thi
bill
if
they
interact
with
other
in
a
way
that
stand
ani
chanc
of
spread
the
viru
final
that
manur
pile
i
mention
below
fit
thi
definit
a
doe
say
releas
a
pet
rattlesnak
to
the
wild
nerv
ga
and
mustard
ga
are
well
defin
other
poison
gas
should
be
individu
ban
onli
if
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
no
use
not
relat
to
weaponri
licens
should
be
avail
for
research
purpos
on
such
chemic
and
i
can
show
where
ani
such
ga
ha
other
use
for
exampl
perhap
we
would
like
to
rid
the
hay
field
of
gopher
calcium
carbid
is
a
rock
that
dissolv
in
water
to
produc
aceteyln
ga
it
can
be
use
for
weld
in
miner
lamp
for
gas
gopher
or
for
make
carbid
bomb
and
do
some
illicit
fish
toss
some
in
a
toilet
and
leav
a
light
cigarett
on
the
seat
and
youll
see
that
it
can
also
be
a
weapon
just
like
ani
other
flammabl
substanc
so
now
my
miner
lamp
wont
work
i
cant
do
ani
weld
and
i
still
have
those
peski
gopher
i
am
not
a
lawyer
but
these
idea
could
certainli
be
a
basi
for
definit
the
basi
for
but
im
sure
you
see
that
the
problem
is
not
in
write
a
law
it
is
in
write
a
law
that
can
not
be
abus
and
extend
beyond
the
point
where
it
doe
ani
good
ill
give
you
a
littl
hint
see
that
manur
pile
in
the
farmer
field
down
the
road
in
the
usa
that
is
a
weapon
of
mass
destruct
nope
it
is
not
consid
a
weapon
it
is
under
your
propos
law
so
is
a
silag
pit
if
there
is
runoff
so
are
underground
fuel
tank
biolog
in
natur
becaus
if
it
get
wash
into
an
open
well
it
will
contamin
the
aquif
that
suppli
thousand
of
citi
with
drink
water
so
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
the
usa
the
epa
ha
rule
that
a
pile
of
scrap
iron
is
illeg
care
to
draw
a
thinner
line
thi
time
it
is
not
defin
a
a
weapon
of
mass
destruct
mani
thing
are
ban
for
other
reason
it
meet
all
the
criterion
of
a
weapon
it
is
an
instrument
that
can
be
use
for
fight
even
though
that
is
not
it
intend
purpos
and
despit
there
be
better
weapon
around
given
that
the
aquif
suppli
a
signific
part
of
the
countri
with
drink
water
mass
destruct
is
rather
a
given
it
not
that
certain
weapon
arent
someth
id
rather
not
see
a
lot
of
peopl
have
the
problem
is
that
it
is
nearli
imposs
to
write
a
law
such
that
it
can
not
be
abus
upon
some
pretext
or
anoth
the
looser
your
definit
the
more
ripe
for
abus
that
law
is
furthermor
if
you
get
specif
then
the
old
standbi
is
to
insert
a
claus
allow
the
list
of
ban
thing
to
be
ad
to
gener
without
go
through
the
hassl
of
anoth
vote
and
public
read
of
the
law
again
