what
happen
in
waco
is
not
the
fault
of
the
batf
if
they
would
of
had
the
proper
equip
and
person
then
they
could
of
captur
the
compound
on
the
initi
assault
and
none
of
thi
would
of
happen
they
did
have
the
proper
equip
the
problem
is
that
they
went
about
thing
the
wrong
way
the
atf
should
have
serv
the
warrant
in
a
peacabl
manner
instead
of
go
in
there
like
a
bunch
of
rambo
with
gun
blaze
im
not
tri
to
excus
what
david

did
im
just
say
that
the
atf
henceforth
to
be
known
a
the
cigarett
cop
went
about
the
raid
in
an
improp
manner
the
batf
need
more
peopl
better
weapon
and
more
armor
transport
when
they
meet
hostil
fire
they
should
be
abl
to
use
more
forc
instead
of
retreat
to
a
stand
off
if
you
are
go
to
do
a
job
then
do
it
right
the
batf
is
there
to
protect

have
the
proper
equip
and
peopl
to
do
the
job
