now
im
realli
get
nervou
sound
like
you
doubt
your

abil
you
sound
pretti
typic
in
thi
respect
you
also
seem
to
think
that
youll
be
safe
or
safer
if
other
are
unarm
thi
is
danger
fantasi
twice
when
i
wa
hike
the
at
i
came
up
on
a
shelter
that
i
wa
plan
on
stay
at
and
saw
someon
sit
there
clean
hi
gun
softli
i
back
away
and
hike
anoth
mile
to
get
out
of
there
ill
freeli
admit
it
here
im
not
afraid
of
gun
im
afraid
of
peopl
that
bring
them
into
the
backcountri
then
you
are
in
need
of
some
form
of
therapi
not
necessarili
that
of
an
analyst
but
mayb
you
should
learn
about
gun
your
fear
is
seem
to
be
base
in
ignor
and
fals
knowledg
you
see
a
person
with
a
gun
and
you
feel
threaten
whi
is
thi
so
have
you
ani
legitim
basi
for
thi
ani
firsthand
experi
that
lend
valid
to
your
fear
or
are
your
fear
base
on
mediat
experi
ie
the
anecdot
of
other
such
a
network
news
i
trust
you
can
see
the
lack
of
legitimaci
in
such
mediat
input
and
whi
are
you
afraid
of
the
peopl
a
mention
abov
forgiv
me
but
you
sound
afraid
to
the
point
of
paranoia
perhap
you
should
talk
to
someon
about
thi
i
am
not
say
thi
to
be
rude
or
fasceti
but
i
think
anyon
with
fear
a
deep
and
baseless
a
your
seem
to
be
need
some
sort
of
help
live
in
fear
realli
suck
even
if
it
is
onli
when
around
peopl
with
gun
in
the
back
countri
tell
me
would
you
be
a
fear
of
a
park
ranger
who
wa
