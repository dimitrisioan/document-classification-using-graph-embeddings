mainli
that

that
im
not

with
all
the

here
is
my
quandari
you
seem
to
be
argu
that
certain
type
of
gun
fall
outsid
the
scope
of
the
second
thi
isnt
a
use
argument
unless
you
believ
that
some
signific
gun
or
class
of
gun
belong
in
that
class
i
think
we
both
agre
that
zip
gun
probabl
arent
protect
mayb
we
also
both
agre
that
all
the
weapon
that
random
state
govern
have
been
ban
or
tri
to
ban
becaus
they
have
no
sport
purpos
and
no
provat
citizen
would
ever
need
these
gun
do
fall
under
the
protect
of
the
second
so
given
that
damn
near
ani
gun
of
ani
practic
util
is
or
ha
at
some
time
been
use
by
the
militari
even
if
onli
for
marksmanship
train
purpos
i
need
to
understand
whi
you
are
intent
on
press
thi
point
argu
that
that
someth
is
not
protect
by
the
second
just
becaus
i
dont
wholeheartedli
endors
the

doe
not
mean
that
i
oppos
the
rkba
thi
attitud
is
what
make

often
what
