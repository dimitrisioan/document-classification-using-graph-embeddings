could
a
further
wait
have
result
in
a

outcom
thi
i
doubt
while
i
question
the
atf
initi
raid
i
believ
that
the
remaind
of
the
standoff
wa
handl
fairli
well
with
the
singl
except
of
the
psycholog
warfar
by
blare
music
etc
i
think
that
wa
uncal
for
and
probabl
hinder
the
outcom
but
suppos
they
had
wait
the
worst
outcom
would
have
been
the
one
that
actual
did
but
with
the
fbiatf
just
stand
there
watch
instead
of
be
a
part
of
the
problem
it
then
would
have
been
veri
clear
exactli
who
wa
at
fault
then
rather
than
the
way
it
turn
out
and
that
would
have
been
the
worst
case
the
best
would
have
been
they
final
get
hungri
and
come
out
possiblelik
well
the
altern
wa
wors
one

im
no
fan
of

but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
ball
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
respons
seem
like
the
waffl
boy
had
problem
figur
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the

which
is
actual
rather
refresh
nowaday
most
of
the
time
the
higherup
claim
i
dont
rememb
or
i
had
no
involv
but
what
doe
it
matter
whi
say
i
dont
rememb
when
it
doesnt
make
ani
differ
altho
the
clintonett
have
been
pretti
good
at
lie
when
it
wasnt
necessari
they
didnt
do
it
thi
time
but
it
wasnt

claim
full

is
a
total
meaningless
gestur
symbol
over

again
ive
offer
to
take
