green
write
just
to
shed
some
light
on
the
fire
it
wa
wide
report
ap
etc
that
there
were
sever
wit
to
bd
folk
start
the
fire
it
ha
also
been
report
that
the
fire
broke
out
in
sever
place
at
onc
which
rule
out
a
bradley
knock
over
a
lamp
etc
a
the
caus
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
seriou
discus
of
thi
incid
i
believ
the
move
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problem
with
some
of
the
tactic
after
watch
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
a
well
a
cnn
and
nightlin
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
action
could
it
have
been
possibl
to
have
taken
koresh
outsid
the
compound
at
some
time
befor
the
feb
th
raid
i
think
it
wa
he
went
into
town
fairli
often
and
wa
known
to
go
jog
thi
wa
even
dure
the
month
period
when
he
wa
be
watch
one
wonder
whi
the
batf
went
ahead
when
they
had
been
warn
accord
to
an
interview
with
a
batf
agent
that
the
bd
were
expect
them
and
whi
they
had
the
medium
in
tow
almost
look
like
they
want
to
have
a
romp
and
a
nice
show
for
the
medium
and
it
all
went
to
hell
he
wa
also
never
known
to
act
violent
he
ha
alway
surrend
peac
befor
but
of
cours
the
warrant
were
serv
peac
he
ha
been
tri
on
the
alleg
befor
and
found
not
guilti
the
justif
for
thi
mess
wa
he
wa
alleg
to
have
purchas
worth
of
gun
and
stuff
over
an
undetermin
time
period
last
i
heard
thi
is
not
a
crime
or
indic
of
one
i
know
of
an
individu
with
that
much
valu
in
gun
should
he
get
a
flythruthedoor
shootfirsttalklat

grenad
are

nobodi
i
know
of
can
say
oh
that
onli
a
stun
grenad
that
ok
can
you
i
sure
can
not
also
one
can
not
be
sure
that
k
figur
is
not
calcul
like
the
fed
calcul
the
valu
of
a
drug
siezur
even
so
it
is
a
so
what
issu
he
wasnt
bother
anyon
besid
the
batf
who
doesnt
like
folk
other
than
themselv
or
other
govt
peopl
have
ani
effect
gun
and
have
an
unapprov
relig
group
are
we
requir
to
not
offend
the
batf
these
day
i
sure
hope
it
hasnt
come
to
that
my
point
is
it
doe
not
add
up
we
need
an
independ
investig
and
now
assum
other
than
fbibatf
are
preserv
the
evid
could
a
further
wait
have
result
in
a
differ
outcom
they
had
the
premisi
bug
i
am
inclin
to
think
a
further
wait
would
have
save
live
one
wonder
whi
they
didnt
have
emerg
gear
on
hand
when
they
move
and
whi
they
didnt
turn
on
the
water
when
a
fire
wa
observ
instead
of
say
aw
gee
there
is
no
water
whi
so
long
befor
the
fire
gear
even
show
up
like
after
the
build
had
pretti
much
finish
burn
fireman
safeti
isnt
that
a
decis
the
firefight
should
be
allow
to
make
no
water
whi
didnt
the
fed
turn
it
back
on
they
sure
could
cut
it
off
quickli
enough
one
doe
wonder
about
the
possibl
of
settl
score
were
fbi
action
blare
loudspeak
etc
the
right
cours
of
action
and
a
few
other
question
like
i
said
i
believ
the
action
taken
in
gener
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reserv
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
ball
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
respons
seem
like
the
waffl
boy
had
problem
figur
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issu
what
doe
take
respons
mean
you
think
she
is
go
to
be
face
jail
time
if
the
act
were
found
to
be
crimin
you
think
she
is
go
to
face
ani
repercuss
if
the
fbibatf
are
found
to
have
act
wrongli
i
dont
it
is
a
nice
pr
gimmick
though
i
am
not
assur
there
will
even
be
a
seriou
independ
investig
for
possibl
wrongdo
or
crimin
act
on
the
part
of
the
batf
or
fbi
i
expect
to
hear
they
are
our
best
law
enforc
they
wouldnt
do
anyth
like
that
no
way
out
of
the
question
end
of
issu
i
want
to
see
an
independ
investig
with
full
prosecut
and
subpoena
power
with
feloni
prosecut
where
feloni
act
are
found
fat
chanc
i
bet
i
bet
the
justic
dept
will
have
an
intern
investig
which
will
turn
up
at
most
poor
judgement
i
hope
i
am
wrong
