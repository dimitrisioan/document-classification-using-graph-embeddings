one
read
the

messag
howev
i
dont
wish
to
enter
into
thi
discus
here
a
it
will
be
yet
anoth
rehears
of
a
longtir
set
of
argument
suffic
it
to
say
that
i
disagre
both
with
the
interpret
of
wellregul
in
the
second
amend
offer
by
gun
lover
and
what
i
think
to
be
their
distort
of
the
same
phrase
in
the
associ
federalist
paper
my
webster
and
my
read
of
the
languag
convinc
me
that
the
word
meant
both
under
control
and
disciplin
and
not
of
good
marksmanship
i
think
the
latter
a
special
interest
plead
no
one
ha
yet
shown
a
contemporat
refer
in
which
well
regul
unambigu
meant
of
good
marksmanship
and
not
under
controldisciplin
etc
thu
i
continu
to
believ
the
second
amend
is
a
militia
claus

not
an
arm
everyon
