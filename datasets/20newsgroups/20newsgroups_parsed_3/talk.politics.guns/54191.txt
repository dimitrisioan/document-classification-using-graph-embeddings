subject
re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
in
articl
thoma
parsli
write
abus
by
the
gover
thi
seem
to
be
one
of
the
main
problem
ani
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abus
by
the
gover
either
some
of
you
are
a
littl
paranoid
no
offenc
mr
parsli
i
have
to
take
except
at
thi
there
are
verifi
previou
exampl
of
level
of
u
govern
abus
guncontrol
restrict
i
dont
think
it
is
paranoid
to
worri
that
what
ha
been
abus
in
the
recent
past
might
be
abus
in
thye
futur
after
so
mani
time
of
get
burn
ani
sane
person
will
stop
put
hi
hand
on
the
stove
or
you
should
get
a
new
gover
you
do
have
elect
id
love
to
but
a
long
a
the
politician
grab
power
to
sell
pork
back
to
their
constitu
there
not
a
lot
i
can
do
it
silli
to
suggest
that
if
there
anyth
we
cant
trust
the
govern
to
do
and
therefor
the
govern
should
be
allow
to
do
it
then
we
should
chang
govern
down
that
road
lie
total
govern
power
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
totalitarian
gun
n
crimin
most
weapon
use
by
crimin
today
are
stolen
thi
is
veri
like
known
crimin
can
not
buy
weapon
that
one
of
the
point
of
gun
control
and
becaus
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europ
we
dont
have
ani
problem
with
smuggl
gun
the
north
american
contin
is
not
europ
no
matter
how
mani
peopl
would
like
it
to
be
drug
are
veri
illeg
and
theyr
here
for
year
canada
ha
crow
about
it
gun
control
if
it
is
necessari
to
control
gun
over
the
whole
contin
then
canada
should
have
alway
had
compar
rate
to
the
u
yet
they
still
dont
unless
you
can
tell
me
whi
the
canadian
border
is
so
much
more
magic
than
the
mexican
border
which
is
shorter
and
far
more
heavili
patrol
then
i
realli
cant
accept
that
argument
mix
weapon
and
thing
that
can
be
use
a
one
what
i
meant
wa
that
car
can
kill
but
they
are
not
gun
no
there
are
approxim
death
due
to
gun
in
the
u
twothird
of
which
are
suicid
unfortun
i
dont
have
suicid
rate
for
norway
howev
thi
make
the
pergun
death
rate
about
half
the
percar
death
rate
the
issu
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agre
that
the
crimin
are
the
main
problem
gun
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
use
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
thi
discus
is
interest
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapon
it
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innoc
peopl
the
problem
is
human
not
gun
the
problem
been
human
sinc
befor
we
had
stone
ax
the
fct
of
the
matter
is
simpli
thi
if
nobodi
ever
assault
anybodi
whether
there
is
a
weapon
of
ani
sort
around
would
be
total
irrelev
yet
weapon
are
built
id
suggest
then
that
the
murder
impuls
in
human
predat
weapon
anyway
the
bosnian
et
al
have
been
make
an
excel
attempt
to
kill
each
other
for
half
a
thousand
year
take
away
their
gun
even
if
we
could
would
neither
halt
the
kill
nor
reduc
the
brutal
if
of
all
murder
wa
done
with
ax
would
you
impos
some
regul
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
use
at
tree
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
it
the
axer
an
exampl
dont
flame
me
just
becaus
not
exactli
are
kill
by
gun
in
the
u
approxim
of
murder
are
commit
with
firearm
with
handgun
with
nonhandgun
the
reason
i
say
that
gun
per
se
are
not
the
problem
is
that
our
nongun
rate
exce
most
of
europ
countri
entir
violent
crime
rate
i
dont
realli
think
weve
got
more
knife
or
fist
in
ani
case
i
think
exampl
of
gun
control
appli
to
the
u
have
been
abkect
failur
just
like
drug
prohibit
and
other
form
of
prohibit
until
you
deal
with
whi
peopl
are
do
what
they
are
do
you
wont
solv
your
problem
and
if
the
problem
is
violent
crime
you
shouldnt
concentr
on
the
tool
instead
the
vast
major
of
gun
is
never
ever
misus
on
the
order
of
over
the
entir
lifetim
of
the
gun
thi
say
to
me
that
you
cant
make
the
argument
that
the
gun
itself
caus
the
misus
think
about
the
situat
in
lo
angel
where
peopl
are
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
is
thi
a
good
situat
the
situat
is
not
good
in
that
peopl
fear
for
their
life
but
recal
the
scene
of
the
storeown
dure
the
last
riot
protect
their
shop
with
gun
would
it
have
been
better
they
too
lost
their
livelihood
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
the
problem
of
poverti
and
rage
in
lo
angel
no
it
isnt
howev
if
that
problem
becom
a
violent
action
then
ye
it
can
be
appropri
whether
or
not
some
person
ha
been
hurt
by
their
condit
wont
make
me
le
dead
if
they
burn
down
my
hous
with
me
in
it
you
have
to
examin
which
problem
your
refer
to
if
your
discuss
someon
violent
assault
you
then
it
is
a
perfectli
legitim
respons
to
make
them
stop
hope
simpli
let
them
know
your
prepar
to
shoot
them
would
be
enough
a
it
wa
with
the
abovement
storeown
if
everybodi
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
from
crimin
and
their
neighbor
who
have
gun
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybodi
had
a
gun
in
usa
of
household
have
some
form
of
firearm
usual
a
long
gun
that
account
for
a
level
of
access
for
at
least
million
american
firearm
ownership
is
most
like
among
educ
welloff
white
the
group
least
like
to

you
may
take
