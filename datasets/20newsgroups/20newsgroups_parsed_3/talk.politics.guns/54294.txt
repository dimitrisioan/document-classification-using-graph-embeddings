thi
may

thing
to

it
is
my
opinion
that
most
educ
or
well
inform
peopl
of
thi
countri
have
some
distrust
of
the
govern
thi
should
exist
becaus
a
a
bureaucraci
ani
govern
given
enough
time
will
tend
to
exist
for
it
self
and
not
for
the
origin
purpos
it
wa
creat
for
thi
distrust
by
the
peopl
should
keep

we

we

the

it
is
to

to
