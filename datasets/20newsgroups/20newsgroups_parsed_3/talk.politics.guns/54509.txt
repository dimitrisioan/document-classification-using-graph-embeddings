a
question
and

session
with
the
press
part
of
go
ahead
sarah
q
there
are
two
question
i
want
to
ask
you
the
first
is
i
think
that
they
knew
veri
well
that
the
child
did
not
have
ga
mask
while
the
adult
did
so
the
child
had
no
chanc
becaus
thi
ga
wa
veri
she
said
it
wa
not
lethal
but
it
wa
veri
danger
to
the
child
and
they
could
not
have
surviv
without
ga
mask
and
on
februari
th
let
go
back
didnt
those
peopl
have
a
right
to
practic
their
religion
the
presid
they
were
not
just
practic
their
religion
they
were
the
treasuri
depart
believ
that
they
had
violat
feder
law
ani
number
of
them
q
what
feder
law
the
presid
let
me
go
back
and
answer
i
cant
answer
the
question
about
the
ga
mask
except
to
tell
you
that
the
whole
purpos
of
use
the
tear
ga
wa
that
it
had
been
test
they
were
convinc
that
it
wouldnt
kill
either
a
child
or
an
adult
but
it
would
forc
anybodi
that
breath
it
to
run
outsid
and
one
of
the
thing
that
ive
heard
i
dont
want
to
get
into
the
detail
of
thi
becaus
i
dont
know
but
one
of
the
thing
that
they
were
specul
about
today
wa
that
the
wind
wa
blow
so
fast
that
the
window
might
have
been
open
and
some
of
the
ga
might
have
escap
and
that
may
be
whi
it
didnt
have
the
desir
effect
they
also
knew
sarah
that
there
wa
an
underground
compound
a
bu
buri
underground
where
the
child
could
be
sent
and
they
were
i
think
they
were
hope
veri
much
that
if
the
child
were
not
releas
immedi
outsid
that
the
human
thing
would
be
done
and
that
the
child
would
be
sent
someplac
where
they
could
be
protect
in
term
of
the
ga
mask
themselv
i
learn
yesterday
i
did
not
ask
thi
fact
question
befor
that
the
ga
wa
suppos
to
stay
activ
in
the
compound
longer
than
the
ga
mask
themselv
were
to
work
so
that
it
wa
thought
that
even
if
they
all
had
ga
mask
that
eventu
the
ga
would
forc
them
out
in
a
nonviol
nonshoot
circumst
m
myer
last
question
q
mr
presid
whi
are
you
still
say
that
q
could
you
tell
u
whether
or
not
you
ever
ask
janet
reno
about
the
possibl
of
a
mass
suicid
and
when
you
learn
about
the
actual
fire
and
explos
what
went
through
your
mind
dure
those
horrend
moment
the
presid
what
i
ask
janet
reno
is
if
they
had
consid
all
the
wors
thing
that
could
happen
and
she
said
and
of
cours
the
whole
issu
of
suicid
had
been
rais
in
the
public
he
had
that
had
been
debat
anyway
and
she
said
that
the
peopl
who
were
most
knowledg
about
these
kind
of
issu
conclud
that
there
wa
no
greater
risk
of
that
now
than
there
would
be
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
that
or
at
anytim
in
the
futur
that
wa
the
judgment
they
made
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
of
cours
we
will
never
know
what
happen
when
i
saw
the
fire
when
i
saw
the
build
burn
i
wa
sick
i
felt
terribl
and
my
immedi
concern
wa
whether
the
child
had
gotten
out
and
whether
they
were
escap
or
whether
they
were
insid
tri
to
burn
themselv
