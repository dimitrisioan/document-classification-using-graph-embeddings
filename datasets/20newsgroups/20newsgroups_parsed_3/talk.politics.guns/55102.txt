all
who
the
hell
are

or
the

the
american
holocaust

govern
just
a
sure
a

head
in
shame
for
what
ive
allow
my
govern
to
becom
i
have
never
judg
them
by
their
religion
but
by
their
action
if
they
had
live
a
quiet
religi
life
a
they
claim
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
sieg
and
no
death
instead
they
chose
cours
of
action
at
everi
turn
that
were
at
the
veri
least
stupid
if
not
irrat
the
first
wa
to

time
i
check
amass
an
arsen
and
practic
ani
kind
of

were
mention
in
pas
in
the
bill
of
right
guess
it
ok
with
you
if
we
just
brush
em
asid
in
order
to
justifi
kill
a
bunch
of
religi
nutcak
eh
of
all
the
idiot
i
run
into
in
daili
life
dan
your
type
scare
me
the
most
youll
accept
expedi
and
a
coward
safeti
over
ani
belief
just
a
long
a
the
govern
tell
you
to
you
assum
that
anyon
who
doesnt
comform
to
your
belief
and
way
of
think
are
wrong
and
therefor

david
koresh
religion
wa
not
mine
but
then
again
neither
are
the
baptist
methodist
cathol
or
ani
of
the
rest
of
the
corpor
religion
but
even
though
koresh
the
baptist
the
methodist
etc
dont
believ
the
same
way
i
do
i
recogn
that
their
religion
are
equal
valid
to
mine
and
more
importantli
are
equal
protect
under
the
st
amend
you
see
im
not
that
much
differ
than
koresh
and
i
suspect
mani
other
fit
the
same
catagori
i
read
the
bibl
mani
time
and
a
i
learn
from
it
i
discov
that
a
lot
of
what
corpor
religion
practic
just
isnt
justifi
by
my
interpret
of
the
bibl
therefor
i
go
my
own
way
so
did
koresh
and
neither
you
nor
i
nor
anyon
el
either
individu
or
collect
a
the
great
socialist
we
ha
ani
right
whatsoev
to
tell
me
or
you
or
koresh
that
our
religion
are
wrong
you
seem
to
think
that
it
would
have
been
oh
so
easi
for
the
davidian
to
just
forsak
everyth
they
believ
in
and
walk
out
of
their
compound
in
order
to
save
themselv
think
if
your
capabl
for
a
moment
about
some
belief
you
hold
dearest
would
you
abandon
that
belief
if
suddenli
told
to
do
so
by
the
govern
if
you
would
do
so
you
are
beneath
contempt
let
assum
you
have
a
belief
that
you
hold
dear
enough
to
commit
your
life
to
do
you
think
it
would
be
the
correct
cours
of
action
for
your
govern
to
initi
action
specif
design
to
forc
you
to
make
that
forsak
or
die
decis
the
forsak
or
die
option
is
exactli
what
the
govern
forc
on
the
davidian
the
day
the
first
wave
of
blackclad
stormtroop
fire
that
first
shot
and
toss
that
