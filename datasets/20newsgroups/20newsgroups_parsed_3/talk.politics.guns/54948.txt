report
that
bodi
of

were

in
a
manner

suggest
they

attempt
to
leav

there
is
a
possibl
that
these
are
the
bodi
of
peopl
kill
dure
the

phill
hallambak
can
you
imagin
what
happen
when
a
magazin
explod
bullet
go
fli
everi
where
imho
these
gunshot
wound
were
actual
caus
when
the
magazin
went
up
a
texa
ranger
doe
not
a
pathologist
make
so
ill
wait
for
an
autopsi
to
determin
if
they
were
shot
first
i
would
doubt
bullet
would
go
fli
there
is
no
particular
forc
to
make
the
bullet
leav
the
scene
of
a
cartridg
go
off
outsid
of
a
barrel
the
brass
shell
would
burst
too
soon
to
give
the
bullet
ani
real
veloc
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
near
it
but
i
do
not
think
bullet
wound
would
result
shrapnel
wound
would
be
more
like
at
least
thi
is
my
understand
not
necessarili
if
the
bodi
had
been
denatur
cook
or
dehydr
due
to
the
heat
a
projectil
need
onli
a

kinet
forc

aftermath
bodi
tend
to
fall
apart
or
loo
larg
chunk
of
meat
with
littl
effort
medic
examin
tend
not
to
like
clean
up
such
scene
a
such
if
the
bodi
had
been
suitabl
cook
a
bullet
com
from
a
magazin
explos
would
more
than
like
have
enough
forc
to
enter
and
thu
it
would
be
difficult
to
determin
whether
a
bullet
enter
at
the
time
of
death
or
much
later
unless
you
were
train
to
look
for
the

texa

are
not
pathologist
either
way
theyr
