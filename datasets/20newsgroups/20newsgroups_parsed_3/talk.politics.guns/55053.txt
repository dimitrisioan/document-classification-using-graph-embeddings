the

rang
from

inspector
to
the
coast
guard
when
the
fbi

start
agent
did
not
have
the
author
oto
carri
gun
they
were
to
be
after
all
a
bureau
of
investig
not
a
polic
forc
all
polic
agenc
will
be
misus
by
anyon
in
power
to
maintain
that
power
the
batf
start
a
a
tax

agenc
whose
primari
job
wa
to

still
when
the
price
of

went
up
so
high
that
moonshin
no
longer
found
their
trade
no
longer
profit
mani
illeg
still
disappear
and
the
batf
need
someth
el
to
do
to
justifi
it
exist
so
it
turn
to
activ
like
phoni
raid
on
gun
store
around
the
time
when
the
batf
annual
budget
is
under
review
the
medium
is
alert
by
the
batf
to
come
to
suchandsuch
a
place
where
at
a
prearrang
time
a
bunch
of
car
full
of
batf
agent
roar
up
to
the
door
and
the
medium
get
great
pictur
of
the
agent
enter
the
premis
of
a
gun
dealer
suspect
of
not
keep
book
properli
the
medium
isnt
invit
in
for
the
bore
hour
of
agent
leaf
through
paperwork
but
if
ani
irregular
are
found
the
medium
get
to
cover
the
agent
remov
arm
of
gun
from
the
premis
and
the
luckless
ffl
in
chain
the
waco
incid
happen
a
few
week
befor
batf
budget
wa
up
for
review
kate
opinion
is
that
it
wa
a
stage
public
stunt
that
went
bad
and
that
the
batf
never
thought
for
a
moment
that
they
would
actual
be
shot
at
or
they
would
have
plan
the
raid
differ
not
send
agent
over
open
ground
with
no
cover
for
exampl
and
would
have
had
some
medic
personnel
on
hand
he
confirm
that
some
year
ago
there
wa
a
warrant
for
koresh
arrest
in
connect
with
a
murder
charg
and
the
local
sheriff
call
him
on
the
phone
and
explain
about
it
koresh
sai
ok
come
pick
me
up
and
the
sheriff
did
temporarili
confisc
all
the
gun
so
that
they
could
be
test
koresh
wa
later
clear
releas
and
presum
got
hi
gun
back
at
least
at
that
time
he
wa
ration
enough
to
be
approach
ration
and
behav
in
a
reason
manner
the
batf
didnt
take
into
account
that
unlik
most
of
the
ffl
they
audit
koresh
wa
actual
paranoid
and
foster
paranoia
in
hi
follow
thu
the
pubic
stunt
look
like
a
real
attack
to
them
and
they
react
accordingli
with
respect
to
the
origin
warrant
it
had
not
been
unseal
when
kate
wa
give
hi
talk
so
he
could
not
comment
on
it
except
to
mention
that
the
batf
ha
been
known
to
not
doublecheck
the
veractiy
of
their
inform
if
they
can
manag
to
get
a
judg
to
issu
a
warrant
he
had
more
to
say
about
the
way
the
warrant
wa
serv
which
may
have
been
complet
illeg
appar
the
proper
way
to
serv
a
warrant
is
to
knock
on
the
door
and
announc
that
your
an
offic
with
a
warrant
for
thusandso
if
they
dont
open
the
door
and
the
evid
is
flushabl
then
it
is
ok
to
break
in
the
door
but
sinc
it
is
hard
to
flush
gun
down
the
toilet
there
may
have
been
no
justif
for
the
batf
break
in
the
way
they
did
if
the
constitut
right
of
the
davidian
were
violat
by
an
invalid
warrant
or
by
an
improperli
serv
warrant
then
the
davidian
may
have
been
justifi
in
their
acton
a
close
look
at
one
of
the
origin
film
show
that
one
batf
agent
may
have
shot
himself
by
accid
when
enter
the
build
if
so
thi
wa
the
first
shot
fire
the
role
of
the
medium
could
have
been
a
whole
lot
wors
after
an
initi
posit
on
the
side
of
the
batf
the
medium
began
to
come
around
to
the
view
that
thi
might
be
a
situat
in
which
legal
arm
citizen
held
off
a
bad
possibl
illeg
attack
a
real
cynic
might
say
that
the
fbi
went
in
when
they
did
becaus
it
wa
clear
that
public
opinion
wa
begin
to
chang
side
and
the
fbi
want
to
act
befor
they
lost
the
public
sympathi
should
the
batf
be
abolish
no
polic
agenc
should
be
numer
diver
ineffici
decentr
etc
better
a
few
inept
accid
like
thi
than
a
move
toward
a
singl
larg
wellorgan
welltrain
power
domest
polic
forc
which
would
eventu
have
even
more
tragic
result
lyn
bate
p
don
kate
will
be
give
a
shorter
version
of
thi
talk
at
boston
colleg
law
school
next
tuesday
april
i
dont
know
the
exact
time
or
place
but
presum
a
phone
call
to
the
bc
law
school
could
elicit
that
inform
