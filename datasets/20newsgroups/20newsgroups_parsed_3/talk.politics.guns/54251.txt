that
not
all
that
kratz
doesnt
know
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switch
to
the
onli
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safeti
on
it
sure
there
is
that
littl
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safeti
now
we
know
that
kratz
doesnt
understand
what
a
safeti
is
suppos
to
do
he

have
multipl
safeti
even
though
onli
one
is
visibl
from

is
suppos
to
