licenc
forgot
that
usa
is
the
land
of
car
get
one
in
scandinavia
and
northern
europ
is
not
easi
averag
time
is
about
hour
of
train
and
the
cost
is
rather
but
we
think
thi
is
accept
becaus
a
car
is
not
a
toy
and
bad
driver
tend
to
hurt
other
if
you
are
realli
bad
you
wont
get
a
lincenc
abus
by
the
gover
thi
seem
to
be
one
of
the
main
problem
ani
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abus
by
the
gover
either
some
of
you
are
a
littl
paranoid
no

or
you
should
get

you
gun
n
crimin
most
weapon
use
by
crimin
today
are
stolen
known
crimin
can
not
buy
weapon
that
one
of
the
point
of
gun
control
same
here
convict
felon
may
not
legal
purchas
firearm
and
becaus
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europ
we
dont
have
ani
problem
with
smuggl
gun
that
you
know
of
while
i
live
in
the
dbr
a
gang
rob
a
joint
u
armybundewehr
armouri
and
got
sever
hundr
m
ammunit
handgun
and
some
explos
when
i
left
two
year
later
there
were
no
clue
mix
weapon
and
thing
that
can
be
use
a
one
what
i
meant
wa
that
car
can
kill
but
they
are
not
gun
someon
said
that
if
we
ban
gun
wed
have
to
ban
car
to
becaus
they
kill
to
i
dont
think
we
should
argu
on
thi
one
the
issu
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agre
that
the
crimin
are
the
main
problem
gun
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
use
is
and
what
are
they
for
who
use
them
is
the
problem
crime
in
the
u
is
no
big
deal
if
you
are
the
crimin
how
about
year
for
murder
credit
for
time
serv
in
jail
wait
for
trial
and
you
are
out
in
month
worst
case
if
we
would
put
crimin
especi
violent
one
in
the
slam
for
true
sentenc
crime
would
drop
instead
we
reward
them
for
be
good
and
let
them
out
earli
veri
earli
i
think
thi
discus
is
interest
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapon
it
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innoc
peopl
the
problem
is
human
not
gun
serb
croat
and
muslim
have
been
kill
each
other
almost
sinc
befor
the
invent
of
gun
old
woman
are
throw
stone
at
un
truck
thi
is
a
hatr
that
goe
beyond
reason
if
of
all
murder
wa
done
with
axe
would
you
impos
some
regul
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
use
at
tree
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
it
the
axer
an
exampl
dont
flame
me
just
becaus
not
exactli
are
kill
by
gun
ye
the
problem
is
the
user
question
back
sinc
you
are
one
of
the
ration
one
if
all
gun
crime
were
to
stop
would
you
support
drop
all
gun
control
think
about
the
situat
in
lo
angel
where
peopl
are
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
is
thi
a
good
situat
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
they
did
not
believ
from
experi
that
the
polic
includ
nation
guard
couldwould
protect
them
unless
you
want
to
argu
that
a
human
be
doe
not
have
a
right
to
protect
himherself
they
did
the
right
thing
what
would
you
suggest
a
a
defens
against
a
mob
throw
bottl
and
rock
and
also
like
arm
with
stolen
firearm
if
everybodi
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
from
crimin
and
their
neighbor
who
have
gun
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybodi
had
a
gun
in
usa
crimin
would
move
to
scandinavia
the
averag
crimin
would
look
for
a
le
hazard
job
and
the
rest
would
like
be
buri
at
counti
expens
dont
flame
the
englishman
becaus
of
northern
irland
they
have
gun
control
that
work
in
england
and
fond
from
usa
are
one
of
the
reason
whi
ira
can
bomb
innoc
someth
about
throw
stone
in
glass
hous
person
i
critic
the
fool
who
send
money
to
the
ira
to
make
ireland
free
of
cours
thi
is
the
last
thing
the
ira
want
becaus
they
lose
power
if
england
pull
out
but
that
for
anoth
group
dont
flame
them
becaus
