and
later
use

crime
what
give
you
the
idea
that
gun
buyback
program
will
have
an
impact
on
ani
of
these
thing
evid
plea
plea
dont
misinterret
what
i
wa
say
joe
i
wa
make
the
point
tha
there
is
no
evid
of
effect
of
gun
buyback
program
but
hope
if
there
is
ani
effect
it
may
prevent
injuri
or
death
in
one
of
these
type
of
common
incid
if
your
a
research
associ
in
urban
child
research
then
perhap
you
can
comment
for
u
on
the
ratio
of
the
accident
gun
death
rate
to
the
rate
of
accident
death
from
other
singl
caus
follow
that
perhap
with
some
sort
of
justif
for
the
amount
of
effort
that
antigunn
spend
tri
to
convinc
the
countri
that
accident
gunrel
death
among
child
in
the
u
is
a
seriou
problem
firearm
are
the
fifthlead
caus
of
unintent
death
among
child
age
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accident
death
is
import
so
gun
dont
kill
a
mani
child
a
car
accid
what
is
the
differ
in
sever
between
death
and
death
i
am
not
tri
to
use
accident
gunrel
death
among
child
a
a
justif
for
gun
control
who
need
to
be
convinc
that
accident
gun
death
of
child
is
a
seriou
problem
i
assum
that
ani
human
person
would
be
concern
when
ani
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parent
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accid
blew
away
one
of
their
friend
ani
death
is
seriou
wan
na
discus
match
control
firearm
relat
unintent
death
among
child
age
and
under
are
the
fault
of
one
or
more
neglig
person
not
the
gun
did
i
say
that
a
child
who
unintent
shoot
someon
is
not
neglig
no
i
hate
to
repeat
myself
jim
but
like
i
told
joe
i
wa
not
attempt
in
ani
way
to
justifi
gun
control
your
right
ani
death
is
seriou
that
wa
my
point
to
joe
who
said
that
antigunn
tri
to
convinv
the
countri
that
accident
gun
death
relat
to
child
are
a
seriou
problem
i
guess
i
assum
everyon
thought
that
it
wa
a
problem
no
i
dont
want
to
discus
match
control
i
dont
equat
a
book
of
match
to
a
load
millimet
either
dont
confus
the
issu
and
plea
dont
say
that
tire
old
nra
line
gun
dont
kill
peopl
peopl
kill
peopl
sure
peopl
can
kill
peopl
without
gun
but
easi
access
to
gun
make
it
a
lot
more
conveni
gun
dont
kill
peopl
peopl
with
easi
access
to
gun
kill
peopl
more
than
anyth
gun
buyback
program
are
symbol
offer
to
the
commun
in
that
sen
i
think
they
might
do
a
littl
good
plea
explain
whi
you
think
symbol
offer
do
good
my
point
wa
gun
buyback
program
which
are
almost
alway
run
by
polic
depart
might
i
stress
might
do
a
littl
i
stress
littl
good
by
give
peopl
the
impress
that
the
polic
are
attempt
to
respond
to
interperson
gun
violenc
in
a
uniqu
way
overal
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
program
were
use
provid
fals
hope
then
is
the
intent
jim
im
just
say
how
it
is
im
not
say
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
not
from
the
polic
who
i
have
talk
with
who
run
some
of
these
gun
buyback
program
i
get
the
impress
that
they
realli
think
they
are
have
an
impact
on
the
commun
when
i
ask
them
if
they
have
an
evaluatori
compon
to
the
program
they
say
well
no
so
in
answer
to
your
question
no
fals
hope
is
not
the
intent
i
think
the
intent
is
to
show
folk
that
polic
are
attempt
to
do
someth
to
curb
interperson
gun
violenc
whether
it
effect
or
not
look
if
you
cant
measur
the
impact
of
these
program
use
some
sort
of
pretest
and
posttest
evalu
what
is
the
point
it
must
be
symbol
in
natur
the
polic
are
essenti
say
look
if
you
have
a
gun
lie
around
and
you
dont
want
it
well
give
you
for
itbecaus
we
care
about
the
commun
if
you
i
and
joe
could
think
of
a
way
to
measur
the
effect
or
ineffect
of
these
program
we
could
becom
rich
and
famou
i
do
know
that
the
vast
major
of
gun
that
are
use
by
youth
or
brought
to
school
by
youth
on
a
daili
basi
about
youth
are
obtain
easili
and
quickli
through
a
person
friend
or
more
often
borrow
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledg
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherev
you
saw
these
statist
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
care
that
is
the
number
of
student
estim
to
have
carri
a
weapon
not
necessarili
a
gun
to

onc
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
student
who
carri
a
gun
to
school
daili
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violenc
or
the
center
for
diseas
control
if
you
look
care
you
will
see
that
you
greatli
underestim
the
presenc
of
gun
in
the
live
of
youth
the
cphv
report
that
youth
bring
gun
to
school
daili
and
that
bring
gun
to
school
at
least
onc
a
year
the
cdc
estim
that
out
f
high
school
student
carri
a
gun
to
school
at
least
onc
in
the
cdc
also
say
that
million
elementaryag
latchkey
child
kid
who
come
home
from

to
an
empti
hous
have
access
to
gun
in
their

didnt
anyth
about
gun
control
what
are
you
talk
about
thu
will
to
follow
a
man
who
claim
to
be
the
messiah
got
news
for
you
folk
if
the
big
chees
wa
on
thi
crazi
planet
of
our
present
he
would
not
be
carri
a
gun
or
hold
child
when
they
were
in
danger
hold
kid
time
for
a
realiti
check
son
these
kid
were
the
child
of
the
peopl
insid
who
believ
that
the
forc
of
evil
were
outsid

to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
child
out
the
door
if
you
believ
a
they
did
okay
mayb
i
word
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
child
in
a
situat
fortifi
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
say
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
child
directli
but
i
would
hope
that
whatev
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innoc
child
die
if
a
he
claim
he
wa
the
messiah
and
peopl
follow
him
a
such
whi
did
he
not
tell
their
parent
to
free
the
child
instead
of
let
them
burn
