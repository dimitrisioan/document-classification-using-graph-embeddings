do
you
knew
how
much
organ
is
requir
to
train
a
larg
group
of

twice
a

just
to
tri
to
get
the

peopl
everi

provid
a

it
requir
a

again
my
respons
is
so
what
is
mr
rutledg
argu
that
sinc
the
local
and
feder
govern
have
abandon
their
charter
to
support
such
activ
and
pass
law
prohibit
privat
organ
from
do
so
that
they
have
elimin
the
basi
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrari
to
anyon
who
understand
the
game
they
have
strengthen
it
no
i
origin
argu
that
the
second
amend
wa
a
littl
bit
and
an
anachron
these
prohibit
law
are
exampl
whi
the
are
an
anachron
after
all
law
in
made
by
repres
of
the
peopl
these
repres
of
the
peopl
have
alreadi
decid
that
the
second
amend
doe
not
appli
or
is
too
broad
in
some
case
sinc
these
repres
feel
an
uncondit
interpret
is
not
want
then
it
is
probabl
that
they
major
of
the
peopl
feel
the
same
way
if
thi
is
so
it
is
an
exampl
of
the
peopl
use
their
power
of
govern
if
thi
is
not
how
the
peopl
feel
the
peopl
should
stand
up
