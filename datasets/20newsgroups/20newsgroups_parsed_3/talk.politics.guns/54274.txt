we
wouldnt

have
thi
situat
but
they
wont
naughti
naughti
next
up
wa
boston
citi
councilman
albert
dapper
oneil
he
wa
there
to
testifi
progun
but
in
some
way
he
wa
a
liabil
he
reason
elderli
and
tend
to
wander
and
repeat
himself
plu
he
almost
a
caricatur
of
a
lawnord
politician
he
badmouth
the
aclu
said
violent
crimin
should
be
execut
and
that
if
he
were
judg
hed
give
arreste
their
last
right
pun
intend
on
the
spot
at
which
mani
of
the
gun
owner
applaud
which
bother
me
he
said
that
all
the
propos
gun
restrict
were
a
step
in
the
right
direct
for
the
crimin
he
said
thi
four
time
two
of
the
bill
under
consider
would
allow
polic
to
rescind
a
ccw
or
fid
and
confisc
all
your
gun
if
someon
had
file
a
restrain
order
against
you
note
that
the
file
of
a
restrain
order
requir
no
warrant
no
hear
no
evid
and
no
convict
just
an
accus
senat
barrett
of
read
testifi
in
favor
of
it
and
patron
the
progunn
there
sever
time
by
say
im
sure
all
the
gun
owner
here
will
agre
with
me
that
we
have
to
get
these
weapon
out
of
the
hand
of
peopl
that
our
court
have
convict
i
havent
seen
such
a
disgustingli
disingenu
perform
sinc
nixon
whine
that
he
wasnt
a
crook
barrett
also
spoke
in
favor
of
the
bill
make
the
fid
card
renew
everi
five
year
instead
of
perman
a
it
is
now
the
state
purpos
is
to
remov
fid
card
from
those
who
have
becom
inelig
revenu
ha
noth
to
do
with
it
yeah
right
appar
some
congressman
think
were
stupid
enough
to
swallow
the
argument
that
it
prefer
to
process
million
renew
everi
cycl
in
the
vagu
hope
of
catch
a
recent
felon
than
to
simpli
take
the
goddamn
card
away
from
a
crimin
at
convict
time
a
usual
hassl
the
lawabid
instead
of
the
crook

sen
jujuga
jujuga
didnt
say
much
he

bad
logic
or
lie
on
the
part
of
either
side
to
go
unchalleng
he
wa
a
cosponsor
of
