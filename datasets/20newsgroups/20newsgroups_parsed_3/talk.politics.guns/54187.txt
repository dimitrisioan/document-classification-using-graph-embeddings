averag
time

abus
by
the

thi
seem
to
be
one
of
the
main
problem
ani
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abus
by
the
gover
either
some
of
you
are
a
littl
paranoid
no
offenc
or
you
should
get
a
new
gover
you
do
have
elect
we
also
have
a
nation
of
million
peopl
mani
issu
and
usual
onli
two
candid
for

a

might
be
will
to
abus
mild

control
law
and
creat
a
defacto

someth
a
major
of
the
peopl
would
object
to

still
be

the

might
look
at
issu
like
the
civil
right
of
minor
health
care
etc
and
vote
for
the
lesser
of
two
evil
i
dont
think
thi
is
a
matter
of
paranoia
sinc
local
govern
in
for
exampl
new
york
and
chicago
have
abus
exist
mild
gun
control
law
to
creat
a
virtual
ban
gun
n
crimin
most
weapon
use
by
crimin
today
are
stolen
known
crimin
can
not
buy
weapon
that
one
of
the
point
of
gun
control
in
which
case
the
unit
state
alreadi
ha
adaqu
gun
control
law
accord
to
feder
statist
onli
of
gunwield
crimin
legal
purchas
their
own
gun
from
licens
dealer
if
that
the
point
of
gun
control
to
prevent
crimin
from
legal
purchas
gun
then
america
doesnt
need
ani
addit
law
to
accomplish
thi
mix
weapon
and
thing
that
can
be
use
a
one
what
i
meant
wa
that
car
can
kill
but
they
are
not
gun
how
is
thi
ani
differ
from
gun
there
are
legal
purpos
for
own
and
use
a
gun
they
are
appropri
tool
for
hunt
target
shoot
and
selfdef
like
car
murder
isnt
their
onli
or
even
a
common
use
if
of
all
murder
wa
done
with
ax
would
you
impos
some
regul
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
use
at
tree
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
it
the
axer
i
certainli
couldnt
imagin
the
american
public
accept
regul
of
ax
while
the
polit
of
other
nation
may
be
differ
in
america
there
is
strong
opposit
to
ani
intrus
law
that
primarili
would
effect
the
averag
lawabid
citizen
who
had
not
done
anyth
wrong
think
about
the
situat
in
lo
angel
where
peopl
are
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
is
thi
a
good
situat
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
a
good
way
to
deal
with
which
problem
it
is
an
excel
way
to
deal
with
the
shortterm
problem
of
riot
and
violent
attack
of
cours
it
doesnt
do
anyth
for
the
longterm
issu
that
start
riot
but
at
thi
point
what
can
these
individu
do
about
longterm
social
problem
if
everybodi
buy
gun
to
protect
themselv
from
crimin
and
their
neighbor
who
have
gun
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybodi
had
a
gun
in
usa
there
are
accord
to
survey
gun
in
of
american
home
in
mani
part
of
the
countri
thi
is
closer
to
those
place
where
almost
everyon
own
a
gun
are
on
averag
safer
than
those
where
gun
are
le
common
last
word
respons
gun
owner
are
not
a
problem
but
they
will
be
affect
if
you
want
to
protect
your
citicen
thi
is
i
think
a
fundament
differ
between
american
govern
and
that
of
other
nation
here
it
is
not
accept
to
punish
or
restrict
the
averag
lawabid
citizen
in
the
name
of
some
vagu
