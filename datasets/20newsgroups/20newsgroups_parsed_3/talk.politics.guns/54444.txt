i
have
been
convinc
of
the
right
of
american
to
an
effect
selfdefens
but
someth
strike
me
a
odd
among
the
prorkba
argument
present
here
the
number
compar
hundr
of
thousand
inde
even
a
million
of
instanc
of
law
abid
citizen
deter
crimin
activ
seem
valid
to
me
likewis
the
number
of
guncaus
homicid
each
year
about
year
howev
it
is
surpris
that
the
evil
antigun
empir
darth
vader
breath
sound
effect
here
never
tri
to
compar
all
legitim
gun
defens
v
all
gun
crime
instead
it
alway
all
legitim
gun
defens
which
includ
case
in
which
the
crimin
are
shot
but
not
kill
and
case
in
which
the
crimin
is
not
here
v
just
crimin
gun
homicid
which
onli
includ
case
sin
which
the
victim
die
whi
is
thi
of
cours
it
wouldnt
be
unreason
to
say
that
in
each

alreadi
measur
involv
gun
the
consequnc
are
alreadi

and
it
is
safe
to
assum
that
a

will
not

turn
into

wherea
in

may
