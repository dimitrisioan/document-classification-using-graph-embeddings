re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
in
articl
david
veal
say
stuff
delet
me
what
seem
to
be
happen
here
is
the
situat
get
total
blown
out
of
proport
in
my
post
i
wa
refer
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruis
around
the
citi
v
gang
member
of
cours
the
polic
have
access
to
the
thing
that
you
mention
but
do
they
use
tank
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
cours
they
dont
and
that
the
point
i
wa
tri
to
make
everi
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
alway
see
cop
come
in
the
major
that
i
see
are
still
carri
revolv
not
that
there
is
anyth
wrong
with
a
revolv
but
if
your
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
coupl
of
automat
in
hi
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handgun
your
go
to
be
at
a
disadvantag
even
with
train
david
thi
is
the
arm
race
fallaci
that
somehow
bigger
gun
make
an
individu
safer
the
problem
is
that
for
each
correspond
level
of
offens
power
the
is
not
an
automat
level
of
defens
increas
the
problem
is
that
there
a
sort
of
lethal
threshold
that
onc
you
get
past
your
onli
talk
about
a
metter
of
degre
regardless
of
what
cop
are
up
against
there
realli
no
reason
for
the
averag
beat
cop
to
have
anyth
bigger
than
a
pistol
on
him
a
a
person
weapon
and
mayb
a
rifl
and
a
shotgun
in
the
cruiser
i
mean
think
about
it
carri
a
monster
pistol
or
submachinegun
doesnt
make
the
cop
ani
le
wound
if
somebodi
shoot
him
a
lot
of
polic
departen
have
switch
to
semiautomat
a
better
more
reliabl
weapon
and
more
stop
power
but
there
a
point
of
diminish
return
thi
is
a
veri
veri
good
point
who
care
what
kind
of
gun
youv
got
if
your
lie
on
the
ground
dead
and
a
far
a
automat
go
ani
gang
member
carri
around
a
coupl
of
automat
an
incred
rariti
is
go
to
be
far
more
of
a
menac
to
himself
and
innoc
bystand
than
anyth
he
might
be
tryinh
to
aim
at
one
auto
is
hard
enough
to
control
anybodi
who
could
control
two
is
go
to
get
the
polic
offic
regardless
of
what
the
polic
offic
is
arm
with
more
stuff
delet
mostli
mine
my
question
is
thi
what
would
a
polic
offic
gain
from
have
a
submachinegun
or
similar
person
weapon
that
he
alreadi
doesnt
have
with
a
mm
or
mm
semiautomat
pistol
i
dont
see
a
how
the
polic
should
be
hose
around
fullauto
fire
nor
ha
my
experi
with
polic
offic
or
the
stat
regard
how
mani
polic
offic
get
kill
by
other
cop
made
me
feel
such
would
be
a
good
idea
precis
fire
is
far
more
prefer
nor
should
they
use
bigger
gun
most
standard
sidearm
have
more
then
suffici
stop
power
when
properli
appli
all
more
power
weapon
would
do
is
make
the
likelihood
of
death
higher
without
realli
give
polic
significantli
more
option
anoth
veri
good
point
that
is
well
taken
it
seem
that
when
lot
of
lead
is
fli
either
the
cop
or
the
gang
someon
innoc
alway
get
caught
in
the
crossfir
david
veal
univ
of
tenn
div
of

educ
info
servic
group
i
still
rememb
the
way
you
laugh
the
day
your
push
me
down
the
elev
shaft
im
begin
to
think
you
dont
love
me
anymor
weird
al
all
point
made
abov
are
well
taken
i
guess
i
am
in
the
mindset
of
have
more
make
it
better
which
is
obvious
not
the
correct
mindset
to
take
in
thi
discus
now
that
i
think
about
the
situat
a
littl
more
care
i
see
your
point
exactli
david
and
i
wholeheartedli
sp
agre
like
i
said
im
just
assum
that
more
bullet
andor
bigger
bullet
is
better
onc
again
though
i
want
to
state
that
i
am
a
progun
individu
and
do
not
believ
that
gun
control
is
realli
a
viabl
option
here
in
the
unit
state
regardless
of
the
drivel
that
i
spout
here
