what
seem
to
be
happen
here
is
the
situat
get
total
blown
out
of
proport
in
my
post
i
wa
refer
to
your
regular
patrolman

a
car
cruis
around
the
citi
v
gang
member
of
cours
the
polic
have
access
to
the
thing
that
you
mention
but
do
they
use
tank
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
cours
they
dont
and
that
the
point
i
wa
tri
to
make
everi
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
alway
see
cop
come
in
the
major
that
i
see
are
still
carri
revolv
not
that
there
is
anyth
wrong
with
a
revolv
but
if
your
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
coupl
of
automat
in
hi
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handgun
your
go
to
be
at
a
disadvantag
even
with
train
i
have
been
at
a
shoot
rang
where
gang
gang
member
were
practic
shoot
they
were
actual
practic
take
out
their
gun
a
quick
a
possibl
and
shoot
at
the
target
and
they
werent
do
too
badli
either
the
univers
cop
here
who
are
are
state
cop
are
arm
better
than
the
chicago
polic
it
seem
most
state
cop
are
everi
citi
and
suburban
polic
offic
ive
seen
around
the
twin
citi
in
the
last
two
year
ha
carri
a
semiauto
of
some
type
differ
brand
though
i
havent
seen
ani
glock
with
regard
to
thi
discus
we
are
get
danger
far
from
the
usual
rant
of
tpg
and
close
to
the
realm
of
rg
but
id
like
to
put
my
two
cent
worth
in
while
there
noth
wrong
with
a
revolv
especi
a
larg
frame
sw
in
magnum
my
favorit
there
are
valid
advantag
to
semiauto
i
suggest
read
massad
ayoob
i
know
some
peopl
cant
stand
him
and
think
he
full
of
bull
but
i
think
that
in
gener
hi
materi
is
veri
valid
and
use
book
the
semi
auto
pistol
in
polic
work
or
someth
like
that
he
defin
a
number
of
way
that
semiauto
are
differ
and
that
differ
is
good
the
main
advantag
is
not
in
increas
firepow
but
in
more
accur
followup
shot
when
you
go
to
singl
action
mode
there
is
also
a
certain
propriatori
natur
of
each
gun
that
take
some
familiar
to
learn
thi
may
have
diminish
with
time
a
more
crimin
becom
familiar
with
differ
model
of
semiauto
but
it
wa
cite
a
stop
or
at
least
slow
down
crimin
who
had
grab
a
polic
offic
gun
defin
arm
better
go
shoot
a
revolv
and
a
semiauto
like
the
colt
doe
one
fire
faster
than
the
other
nope
asid
from
which
faster
rate
of
fire
is
usual
not
desir
sure
it
make
the
other
guy
duck
for
cover
but
just
you
tri
hit
anyth
with
a
thompson
in
hosemod
thi
is
whi
the
militari
is
limit
it
m
now
to
round
burstfir
simpl
semiauto
would
be
better
but
the
troop
like
to
be
abl
to
rock
and
roll
even
if
it
is
wast
of
ammo
someth
often
in
short
suppli
when
the
enemi
is
plenti
a
revolv
is
equal
capabl
a
a
semiauto
in
the
same
calib
a
revolv
also
ha
the
advantag
that
if
it
misfir
you
just
pull
the
trigger
again
a
doubleact
revolv
almost
all
of
them
can
be
handcock
first
but
will
fire
mere
by
pull
the
trigger
ye
but
thi
is
best
done
with
a
two
hand
hold
with
a
singl
hand
you
either
pull
the
gun
far
off
target
to
cock
or
must
fire
doubl
action
the
da
semi
auto
ha
the
same
advantag
plu
is
alway
sa
after
the
first
shot
a
misfir
in
a
revolv
mere
mean
you
must
pull
the
trigger
again
to
rotat
to
the
next
round
im
not
sure
if
thi
is
meant
to
be
differ
from
your
first
point
in
a
da
semiauto
you
can
pull
the
trigger
again
to
tri
drop
the
hammer
on
the
same
round
an
advantag
you
dont
have
in
a
revolv
where
the
next
trigger
pull
will
alway
go
to
the
next
round
discus
thi
point
now
thi
is
fine
with
a
dud
but
what
about
a
hangfir
situat
grant
it
veri
rare
but
your
round
will
now
go
off
confin
in
the
cylind
with
no
place
to
go
slingshot
the
slide
on
a
misfir
take
veri
littl
time
a
revolv
can
be
carri
with
the
th
chamber
empti
and
under
the
hammer
for
maximum
safeti
but
still
can
be
drawn
and
fire
with
an
easi
motion
even
one
hand
actual
with
modern
revolv
design
incorpor
hammer
block
thi
is
not
necessari
or
usual
recommend
a
revolv
would
have
to
fall
hard
enough
and
at
the
right
angl
to
actual
break
the
hammer
and
driver
the
fire
pin
into
the
round
to
set
it
off
speedload
for
a
revolv
allow
reload
almost
a
fast
a
magazin
on
semiauto
can
be
faster
depend
on
user
the
best
speedload
user
especi
those
use
the
spring
load
speed
loader
are
veri
fast
a
problem
is
that
eject
the
spent
case
is
a
two
hand
job
where
drop
the
expend
magazin
is
one
hand
thi
mean
that
while
you
can
be
insert
a
fresh
magazin
a
soon
a
the
old
one
clear
the
gun
with
a
speed
loader
you
have
to
go
through
more
motion
that
will
alway
take
more
time
you
also
dont
have
the
advantag
of
tactic
reload
replac
a
partial
magazin
to
bring
you
back
to
full
capac
the
partial
magazin
can
still
be
use
if
need
later
a
misfir
in
a
semiauto
will
requir
you
to
clear
a
jam
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
a
you
realiz
hey
it
jam
befor
start
to
do
anyth
about
clear
it
ye
the
time
to
recogn
the
problem
is
just
a
import
a
the
time
to
clear
it
realli
though
in
either
a
revolv
or
semiauto
the
odd
of
an
actual
misfir
with
factori
ammo
are
aw
small
you
are
more
like
to
get
a
jam
in
a
semiauto
but
even
these
are
except
rare
with
modern
qualiti
gun
sig
glock
etal
most
semiauto
must
have
the
slide
work
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
polic
carri
their
semiauto
with
the
chamber
load
and
hammer
cock
but
a
safeti
engag
i
do
not
consid
thi
safe
howev
you
must
tradeoff
safeti
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employ
a
a
revolv
there
are
some
doubleact
semiauto
out
there
but
the
complex
of
oper
of
mani
of
them
requir
more
train
all
common
semiauto
can
be
carri
with
a
round
in
their
chamber
without
ani
safeti
problem
while
i
put
that
out
a
a
statement
that
i
believ
i
should
say
that
thi
appli
to
all
of
the
one
ive
look
at
for
the
da
semi
it
no
differ
from
the
revolv
situat
the
gun
all
have
hammer
or
fire
pin
block
they
also
have
a
safeti
becaus
there
no
real
advantag
carri
one
of
these
cock
and
lock
you
have
the
same
safeti
and
speed
of
employ
a
a
revolv
plu
the
advantag
of
sa
followup
shot
im
not
familiar
with
sa
semiauto
except
for
the
a
i
admit
that
i
wa
initi
skeptic
about
carri
thi
cock
and
lock
but
after
examin
the
design
tri
to
defeat
the
safeti
gun
unload
of
cours
and
shoot
it
a
lot
i
see
no
inher
safeti
problem
with
it
especi
in
a
thumbreak
holster
with
the
strap
under
the
hammer
thi
design
also
get
you
more
speed
for
an
accur
first
shot
than
a
revolv
some
polic
depart
switch
to
glock
and
then
start
quietli
switch
mani
offic
back
to
the
old
revolv
too
mani
were
have
accid
partli
due
to
the
poor
train
they
receiv
not
that
glock
requir
rocket
scientist
but
some
cop
are
baffl
by
someth
a
complex
a
the
timer
on
a
vcr
yeah
the
infam
glock
i
still
cant
figur
out
how
it
wors
than
a
revolv
for
safeti
if
you
dont
pull
the
trigger
it
doesnt
go
off
i
imagin
that
if
all
your
revolv
shoot
wa
done
doubl
action
then
you
could
pull
the
glock
trigger
far
enough
to
fire
befor
you
realiz
it
in
addit
if
you
had
develop
that
nasti
habit
of
keep
your
finger
on
the
trigger
when
holster
your
gun
and
reli
on
your
thumb
on
the
hammer
to
remind
you
to
take
it
off
befor
you
blew
off
your
foot
then
youd
have
problem
when
the
hammer
wasnt
there
anyon
who
goe
anyon
say
that
the
crimin
obvious
outgun
the
polic
dont
know
noth
about
firearm
turn
off
cop
and
hunter
and
pay
attent
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiauto
are
junk
mere
that
assum
they
are
better
for
all
job
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolv
on
hi
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equip
for
anyth
short
of
a
riot
i
think
thi
is
even
okay
for
a
riot
a
long
a
it
a
small
one
b
gun
control
is
hit
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernin
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anyth
good
control
fire
from
a
revolv
is
more
like
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
mm
beretta
myself
but
consid
it
inferior
a
a
carri
weapon
to
someth
like
the
ruger
secur
six
revolv
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aim
at
in
the
first
shot
someth
is
quit
serious
wrong
somewher
while
i
might
like
have
the
backup
capac
of
those
extra
shot
in
certain
case
overwhelmingli
the
of
shot
fire
in
crimin
encount
is
le
than
i
have
the
poor
man
beretta
tauru
and
consid
it
inferior
a
a
carri
weapon
to
the
springfield
oop
mm
v
argument
are
releg
to
rg
you
are
right
though
if
you
dont
hit
what
you
aim
at
then
the
shootergun
combin
ha
fail
i
dont
ascrib
failur
in
the
the
fire
real
fast
with
a
wondernin
scenario
you
mention
to
the
gun
thi
is
a
shooter
failur
whether
through
lack
of
disciplin
or
lack
of
train
what
do
crook
overwhelmingli
use
in
crime
whi
the
same
nice
simpl
revolv
that
the
polic
often
use
well
actual
some
polic
prefer
the
much
heftier
magnum
but
anyway
mm
are
becom
more
popular
with
crook
too
though
the
doe
still
lead
the
list
and
like
i
said
around
here
semiauto
seem
the
rule
for
the
street
cop
dont
know
about
the

patrol
howev
they
may
still
carri
the

patrolman
obplea
dont
flame
me
i
prefer
semiauto
for
most
thing
but
they
introduc
unneccessari

just
my
