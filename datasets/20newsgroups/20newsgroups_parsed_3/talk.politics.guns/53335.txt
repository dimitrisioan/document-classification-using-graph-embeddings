grade
fission
is
current
regul
onli
by
market
forc
ie
to
own
them
you
have
to
either
make
them
buy
them
or
steal
them
the
onli
thing
that
stop
you
is
the
stagger
cost
more
than
most
nation
can
afford
the
fact
that
no
one
who
ha
them
want
to
sell
to
you
and
the

plutonium
or

uranium
one
wa
requir
to
obtain
a
feder
permit
to
own
such
materi
given
a
sourc
of
fission
you
can
build
a
bomb
in
your
garag
with
part
from
hardwar
store
and
electron
junk
suppli
you
might
have
to
engag
in
some
shadi
deal
to
get
the
explos
charg
but
that
trivial
compar
to
get
the
plutonium
the
basic
inform

the

wa

actual
whi

look
it
up
from
the
materi
we
cover
last

in

of
gech
nuclear
chemistri
i
could
deriv
what
it
would
take
to
build
a

and
a

i
a
a

could
synthes
a
varieti
of
explos
from
commonli

chemic
in
the
garag
if
i
felt
like
the
electron
behind
the
deton
and
the
shape
charg
are
a
littl
trickier
howev
but
not
imposs
use
a
few
trick
of
the
trade
and
if
i
realli
want
to
be
nasti
i
could
includ
a
core
of
hydrogen
and
deuterium
of
cours
the
hardest
part
is
get
the
fission
materi
to
start
with
and
live
long
enough
