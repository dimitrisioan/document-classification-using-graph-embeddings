near
woodstock
virginia
me

a
friend
hi
wife
and
hi

were
hike
in
a
total
desol
mountain
area
all
of
a
sudden

rain
down
on
u
look
up
we

an
obviou
stash
they
were

no
need
to

more
violent
level
than

experienc
i
guess
we
should
have
tri
harder
to
understand
and
cope
with
the
anger
that
societi
had
instil
in
them
and
wa
drive
them
