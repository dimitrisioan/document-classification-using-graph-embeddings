re
dont
knock
the
glock
wa
re
my
gun
is
like
my
am
ex
card
in
articl
jason
kratz
write
all
veri
true
im
go
on
what
i
have
read
and
heard
from
friend
basic
the
glock
is
great
but
i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
learn
proper
handl
becaus
of
the
type
of
safeti
that
it
ha
i
wa
look
at
a
glock
sw
and
the
sw
a
coupl
of
week
ago
and
the
safti
on
the
gun
were
veri
differ
the
saftey
on
the
seem
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
cours
thi
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebodi
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddl
around
turn
the
safeti
off
person
i
like
the
glock
becaus
they
are
veri
light
and
i
think
they
look
realli
cool
guess
that
whi
they
use
them
in
so
mani
movi
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
a
my
first
semiauto
becaus
of
the
safeti
i
would
prefer
more
train
with
a
tradit
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of
cours
that
just
my
opinion
jason
at
the
risk
of
start
the
my
gun
is
better
than
your
flame
war
i
must
disagre
there
is
no
secret
in
handl
a
glock
in
fact
it
is
often
chosen
besid
it
other
merit
becaus
it
shoot
like
a
revolv
doe
basic
it
can
limit
the
train
time
read
budget
due
to
the
fact
there
are
no
extern
safti
other
than
the
trigger
henc
le
train
time
requir
smith
wesson
among
other
type
are
chosen
due
to
the
fact
taht
they
do
have
the
extern
safti
hammer
dropa
well
a
mag
drop
which
if
properli
use
have
save
mani
life
when
mr
bad
snatch
the
gun
from
the
offic
and
tri
to
shoot
said
offic
the
gun
wa
on
safe
and
would
not
fire
thi
point
had
been
made
in
mani
articl
in
variou
gun
magazin
if
fact
one
author
cant
rememb
who
stage
a
littl
test
where
he
had
a
revolv
and
a
sw
on
safe
lay
on
a
tabl
and
ask
peopl
with
littl
firearm
experi
to
on
hi
signal
grab
the
gun
and
shoot
a
target
he
time
the
peopl
use
each
gun
the
revolv
time
were
pretti
close
but
some
of
the
time
with
the
sw
were
in
minut
or
the
person
just
gave
up
becaus
they
could
not
figur
out
the
saftey
you
dont
often
see
colt
auto
issu
due
to
the
light
trigger
which
can
be
accident
fire
in
a
stress
situat
open
the
issu
citycounti
etc
to
lawsuit
bad
press
etc
of
cours
ani
problem
can
be
overcom
with
enough
train
but
such
train
is
not
alway
avail
to
budget
crunch
depart
i
know
if
i
were
a
cop
i
would
want
someth
like
a
sw
just
for
the
off
chanc
of
the
gun
get
taken
away
the
safeti
doesnt
guarante
that
mr
bad
wont
figur
it
out
and
shoot
me
but
it
could
buy
enough
time
to
draw
a
second
gun
and
shoot
mr
bad
befor
it
too
late
dont
think
i
am
too
biass
here
just
becaus
i
have
had
glock
in
my
possess
at
one
time
becaus
i
have
had
a
a
well
in
fact
it
wa
my
first
handgun
rememb
the
ultim
safeti
is
you
the
oper
and
no
safeti
is
go
to
stop
an
neglig
discharg
note
i
dont
say
accident
if
you
break
the
rule
of
gun
handl
a
per
the
part
of
be
light
weight
and
look
cool
i
agre
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
a
a
first
purchas
just
