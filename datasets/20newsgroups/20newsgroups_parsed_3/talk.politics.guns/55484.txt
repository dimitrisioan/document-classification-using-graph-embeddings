total
firearm

is
one
of
the
smallest
caus
of
death
in
child
car
fall
burn
drown
food
ingest
are
all
much
larger
caus

accid
were
the
fifthlead
caus
of
accident
death
for

and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accident
death
is
import
so
gun
dont
kill
a
mani
child
a
car
accid
what
is
the
differ
in
sever
between
death
and
death
the
differ
is
that
a
ration
person
would
address
the
lead
caus
first
and
address
the
lesser
caus
later
that
think
is
so
screw
up
i
dont
even
know
how
to
respond
to
it
a
ration
person
would
concentr
on
motor
vehicl
death
and
not
attempt
to
affect
childhood
fall
drown
gunshot
injuri
etc
so
thi
so
call
ration

were
attempt
to
affect
the
lead
caus

dont

just
becaus
a

a
anoth
we
should
not

i

to

the
suppos
sever
of
caus
of
childhood
death
i
am
realli
get
frig
sick
of
have
to
respond
to
the
irrat
statement
of
peopl
who
assum
that
someon
who
want
to
discu
youth
gun
violenc
or
unintent
youth
gun
death
is
tri
to
make
a
polit
issu
out
of
it
i
assum
that
ani
human
person
would
be
concern
when
ani
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parent
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accid
blew
away
one
of
their
friend
a
human
person
who
keep
a
firearm
in
the
hous
with
a
year
old
would
also
teach
thi
child
how
to
safe
handl
the
firearm
ignor
is
our
greatest
enemi
again
charl
you
tend
to
confus
the
issu
and
take
thing
out
of
context
for
your
own
purpos
the
statement
that
you
respond
to
abov
is
actual
in
refer
to
a
previou
post
by
anoth
person
who
like
you
express
concern
over
make
youth
gun
violenc
a
prioriti
i
guess
mayb
human
person
and
ration
person
could
be
interchang
huh
both
would
be
defin
a
a
person
who
onli
address
the
social
problem
that
caus
the
greatest
number
of
childhood
death
if
that
is
the
case
im
extrem
glad
that
i
am
inhuman
and
irrat
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violenc
what
other
sourc
of
inform
do
you
have
which
confirm
their
data
these
folk
are
well
known
for
misrepres
the
fact
perhap
you
can
verifi
their
data
with
the
uniform
crime
report
sorri
charl
the
fbi
uniform
crime
report
is
well
known
for
misrepres
the
fact
but
if
you
insist
accord
to
the
ucr
firearm
murder
of

under
increas
percent
between

is
the
