everi

everi
singl
day
i
hear
about
more
peopl
get
kill
by
gang
violenc
and
see
some
of
the
weapon
that
are
be
confisc
is
kratz
claim
that
he
can
reliabl
visual
distinguish
an
m
from
an
ar
that
he
can
see
the
differ
between
a
semiauto
and
a
fullauto
uzi
that
he
can
see
the
differ
between
the
variou
version
some
fullauto
some
semiauto
onli
of
the
m
well
let
me
see
uzi
no
m
no
mar
mayb
i
rememb
there
be
a
selector
swtich
on
the
ar
if
i
rememb
correctli
plea
correct
me
if
im
wrong
the
switch
would
set
to
an
off
posit
or
an
on
posit
becaus
the
gun
ar
is
semiautomat
wouldnt
the
m
have
a
posit
for
semiauto
fire
and
fullauto
fire
or
mayb
round
burst
if
thi
is
correct
wouldnt
it
be
easi
to
distinguish
each
gun
by
thi
alon
of
cours
if
the
ar
were
modifi
to
fullauto
fire
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
be
that
easi
but
im
talk
about
distinguish
between
an
unmodifi
ar
and
m
how
about
the
other
gun
do
they
also
have
selector
switch
to
switch
between
semiauto
and
fullyauto
fire
if
so
id
love
to
hear
the
detail
if
onli
becaus
theyll
demonstr
that
kratz
is
blow
smoke
consid
that
one
can
design
a
gun
so
that
it
look
just
like
anoth
gun
yet
have
veri
differ
properti
and
that
that
quit
common
most
kid
in
my
neighborhood
were
quit
young
when
they
figur
out
that
my
parent
car
wasnt
much
like
richard
petti
even
though
it
look
just
like
it
except
for
the
paint
job
thing
must
have
been
differ
with
kratz
actual
it
wa
pretti
hard
for
the
kid
in
my
neighborhood
to
figur
that
out
a
richard
petti
live
in
my
neighborhood
and
left
hi
stock
car
in
the
driveway
sure
it
on
tv
but
whi
doe
that
make
a
differ
no
it
doesnt
but
that
irrelev
if
visual
inspect
of
the
outsid
work
tv
would
be
accept
but
sinc
it
doesnt
the
fact
that
it
just
a
good
a
see
in
person
doesnt
mean
much
well
what
about
what
i
said
abov
if
that
is
correct
i
guess
tv
would
be
accept
if
you
had
a
good
enough
pictur
and
a
pictur
of
the
lower
receiv
of
the
arm
andi
gave
kratz
a
chanc
to
back
down
on
thi
in
privat
jason
kratz
didnt
take
