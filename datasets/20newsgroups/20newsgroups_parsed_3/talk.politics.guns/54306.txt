handl
of
thi

attempt

at
one
point
wa
that
they
thought
the
cult
member
would
be
at

servic
my
onli
comment
on
thi
bit
of
idioci
is
that
if
your
go
to
oper
a
a
quasimilitari
unit
youd
better
understand
basic
militari
tactic
one
cardin
rule
is
that
onli
a
fool
plan
an
oper
where
if
one
assumpt
is
incorrect
the
oper
will
fail
disastr
we
were
told
that
atf
got
four
agent
kill
becaus
they
were
outgun
they
didnt
expect
such
heavi
resist
when
question
about
whi
such
an
overwhelm
militarystyl
assault
wa
plan
we
were
told
that
it
wa
becaus
the
cultist
were
thought
to
be
heavili

and
refer
to
them
a
a
bunch
of
crockett
and
tubb
wannab
im
more
than
ever
convinc
that
right
on
target
an
anecdot
not
relat
to
the
waco
fiasco
is
that
appar

thi
is
not

i
wa
told
thi
by
a
rel
of
my
wife
who
happen
to
be
an
fbi
agent
hi
opinion
of
the
batf
wa
ummm
well
let
just
say
uncomplimentari
i
have
still
not
been
present
with
one
iota
of

that
the

of

a
point
re

their
handl
of

reflect
a
complet
lack
of
understand
of
the
probabl
thought
process
of
the
cultist
ag
reno
said
they
push
the
button
becaus
they
were
afraid
a
mass
suicid
wa
in
the
of
my
onli
comment
on
that
is
that
if
the
cultist
were
that
close
to
the

what
the
hell
did
she
think
their
reaction
would
be
to
an
hourslong
