at
the

news
in
articl
steve
mane
write
that
all
veri
well
and
good
but
i
wa
refer
to
all
homocid
not
just
one
involv
handgun
what
is
thi
fixat
on
death
by
shoot
a
if
it
were
somehow
wors
than
death
by
stab
what
relev
are
all
homicid
in
thi
debat
the
issu
is
gun
not
basebal
bat
no
the
issu
is
reduc
crime
not
gun
if
gun
control
doesnt
lower
crime
overal
then
is
doesnt
address
the
issu
even
a
simpleton
know
that
he
stand
a
better
chanc
of
surviv
an
attack
with
a
basebal
bat
doe
that
matter
if
assault
with
a
basebal
bat
becom
much
more
common
mugger
use
a
gun
reli
primarili
on
the
threat
of
the
gun
and
rare
shoot
their
victim
a
mugger
use
a
knife
is
much
more
like
to
start
by
stab
hi
victim
in
an
effort
incapacit
him
so
while
a
knif
may
not
be
a
deadli
a
a
gun
crimin
are
more
like
to
actual
use
the
knife
a
oppos
to
threaten
the
victim
with
it
it
isnt
at
all
clear
that
replac
the
crimin
gun
with
a
knife
would
reduc
murder
stab
might
just
becom
more
common
that
whi
it
is
import
to
look
at
the
overal
not
the
withgun
homicid
rate
it
avoid
the
issu
of
substitut
differ
crimin
techinqu
of
use
differ
weapon
etc
and
measur
what
we
want
to
prevent
murder
a
for
knive
see
my
earlier
post
id
much
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
thank
face
possibl
howev
face
knifeweld
attack
isnt
too
common
stab
without
warn
and
by
suppris
is
the
usual
tactic
veri
few
crimin
shoot
from
cover
it
attract
to
much
attent
and
they
dont
have
a
chanc
to
go
through
your
pocket
overal
id
much
rather
be
threaten
with
a
gun
than
actual
stab
with
a
knife
fortun
the
best
defens
against
a
knife
isnt
anoth
knife
anyon
train
in
unarm
selfdefens
wont
have
much
of
a
problem
disarm
a
knife
assail
untrain
in
knife
assault
which
probabl
mean
of
knife
assail
actual
the
exact
same
statement
is
true
of
gun
train
in
unarm
selfdef
will
let
you
disarm
an
untrain
gunman
without
much
problem
you
also
ignor
the
crimin
reaction
the
nation
crime
survey
clearli
show
that
crimin
unarm
arm
with
a
knife
gun
or
whatev
are
unwil
to
risk
their
live
in
a
confront
if
face
with
a
seriou
threat
almost
all
prefer
to
leav
and
find
an
easier
target
therefor
use
or
threaten
to
use
a
is
much
more
commonli
the
case
a
weapon
is
the
best
defenc
against
an
attack
regardless
of
how
he
is
arm
knive
howev
are
much
le
effect
than
gun
crimin
dont
consid
knife
a
a
seriou
