re
jffo
ha
gone
a
bit
too
far
have
read
the
post
long
articl
by
jpfo
i
have
some
observ
thi
articl
doe
not
claim
that
the
gca
of
is
a
verbatim
translat
of
a
nazi
law
what
it
say
is
that
in
anoth
place
the
book
theyr
talk
about
they
compar
the
two
thing
section
by
section
the
implic
is
that
the
similar
are
devast
in
the
next
sentenc
they
talk
about
how
in
that
book
they
reproduc
the
german
text
of
the
nazi
law
togeth
with
it
translat
not
surprisingli
a
reader
could
easili
conflat
these
two
thing
into
a
singl
idea
that
the
american
gca
is
a
liter
translat
of
the
nazi
law
and
sure
enough
that
what
the
whole
thing
ha
mutat
into
urbanfolklor
style
the
articl
goe
to
great
pain
to
establish
that
senat
dodd
had
a
copi
of
the
nazi
law
either
from
hi
time
on
the
nurnberg
prosecut
team
or
later
thi
fact
is
consid
highli
incrimin
but
i
dont
understand
whi
the
author
repeat
sever
time
that
he
is
simpli
unabl
to
imagin
how
anyon
could
come
into
posse
of
the
origin
text
and
yet
in
a
paragraph
toward
the
end
he
explain
it
perfectli
if
dodd
got
hi
copi
of
the
origin
german
text
of
the
nazi
weapon
law
dure
hi
time
at
nurnberg
it
like
wa
part
of
a
collect
of
document
for
exampl
issu
of
the
reichsgesetzblatt
the
german
law
registri
bingo
exactli
dodd
had
a
book
with
a
seri
of
nazi
law
in
it
includ
the
one
under
discus
all
of
the
stuff
about
whi
would
a
u
congressman
have
a
copi
of
a
nazi
law
melt
away
by
the
author
admiss
he
then
continu
but
if
he
acquir
the
origin
german
text
of
the
nazi
weapon
law
after
hi
servic
at
nurnberg
he
must
have
done
so
for
a
veri
specif
reason
but
there
absolut
no
reason
to
think
that
thi
is
the
case
in
fact
a
a
senior
member
of
the
u
team
that
help
to
prosecut
nazi
war
crimin
it
seem
to
me
that
he
would
have
had
to
have
a
copi
all
argument
about
whether
the
nazi
weapon
law
is
realli
of
histor
interest
a
it
obvious
is
certainli
accord
to
the
author
here
or
whether
dodd
person
prosecut
the
interior
minist
who
sign
it
can
be
put
asid
a
red
her
have
establish
that
dodd
own
a
copi
of
the
origin
german
text
the
jpfo
articl
then
tri
to
draw
sinist
implic
from
the
fact
that
he
ask
to
have
it
translat
the
problem
is
in
the
context
of
the
charg
level
at
dodd
these
two
thing
work
against
each
other
peopl
ask
to
have
thing
translat
when
they
dont
know
what
they
mean
if
dodd
took
it
upon
himself
to
preserv
the
nazi
law
with
idea
of
someday
introduc
it
into
american
law
sure
by
he
would
have
know
what
it
meant
wouldnt
he
anyway
thi
precis
charg
the
main
one
that
i
question
in
an
earlier
post
is
just
silli
whi
would
dodd
need
the
exact
translat
for
thi
purpos
is
the
idea
that
the
gun
control
despit
be
presum
bent
on
disarm
the
populac
with
the
goal
of
eventu
destroy
all
civil
liberti
need
a
crib
sheet
didnt
they
have
ani
idea
how
to
do
it
on
their
own
onc
again
the
author
provid
a
perfectli
accept
answer
to
hi
own
question
dodd
may
have
offer
hi
copi
of
the
nazi
weapon
law
to
show
that
the
specif
propos
did
not
resembl
anyth
in
the
nazi
law
in
fact
sinc
the
law
and
it
translat
were

the

he
ask
for
the
translat
in

to
put
it
in
