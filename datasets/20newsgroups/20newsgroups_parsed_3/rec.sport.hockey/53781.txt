bruce
wa
bother
virtual
all
of
thi
season
with
a
groin
injuri
which
kept
him
out
of
the
lineup
for
all
by
game
thi
season
of
cours
it
is
difficult
to
specul
how
well
he
would
have
done
thi
season
had
he
not
been
affect
by
the
injuri
but
the
yearold
bruce
wa
effect
with
a
man
up
or
a
man
short
in
the
shark
first
season
and
wa
expect
to
be
a
strong
offens
leader
thi
season
a
well
the
injuri
appear
seriou
which
is
a
shame
becaus
otherwis
he
may
have
a
much
brighter
futur
for

b
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
the
flyer
decis
to
unload
pederson
after
a
veri
good
offens
season
last
season
point
in
game
but
after
ride
the
pine
earli
in
the
season
pederson
wa
summarili
sent
to
the
shark
in
exchang
of
the
defensivemind
snuggerud
and
he
finish
with
game
combin
with
the
flyer
and
the
shark
he
wa
also
limit
by
injuri
thi
season
and
thi
limit
hi
product
point
but
when
healthi
pederson
appear
impress
with
a
good
score
touch
good
size
and
the
willing
to
throw
it
around
although
he
not
consid
a
physic
forward
and
good
speed
he
also
doe
not
appear
to
be
a
liabil
on
defens
but
the
shark
probabl
have
to
wait
until
next
season
to
see
how
much
exactli
pederson
can
do
john

grade
i
bb
carter
wa
definit
one
of
the
hardest
worker
on
the
team
and
the
hard
work
work
wonder
a
at
time
he
look
great
on
ice
howev
although
he
did
look
great
at
time
the
fact
that
he
receiv
just
point
in
game
for
hi
effort
is
a
sign
that
there
is
onli
so
much
hi
hard
work
can
do
and
the
shark
confirm
that
by
send
him
to
kansa

with
about
