re
minnesota
shame
ive
been
under
the
impress
that
minnesota
wa
one
of
or
possibl
the
hockey
state
in
the
u
so
whi
is
the
team
move
to
a
citi
in
texa
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedi
selfserv
profit
or
were
the
star
realli
not
make
a
profit
or
wa
the
citi
or
whoever
own
the
arena
do
some
price
goug
norman
green
claim
that
he
ha
lost
money
over
the
last
three
year
that
he
ha
own
the
team
when
he
bought
the
team
it
seem
kind
of
obviou
that
he
wa
go
to
have
to
deal
with
a
few
year
in
the
red
befor
the
team
start
make
a
profit
again
he
gave
the
impress
that
he
wa
will
to
do
so
he
claim
two
year
ago
that
the
team
need
to
averag
onli
fan
per
game
in
order
to
pull
a
profit
but
thi
season
the
team
averag
fan
despit
increasd
ticket
price
i
think
the
team
attend
and
play
wa
clearli
in
an
upward
trend
which
leav
me
dumbfound
a
to
how
he
could
ignor
that
in
decid
to
move
he
wa
even
offer
the
mani
concess
he
rude
demand
such
a
guarante
season
ticket
sale
cheap
rent
at
the
other
two
arena
in
town
etc
oh
well
i
guess
the
bottom
line
is
green
want
immedi
huge
return
in
dalla
and
wasnt
will
to
wait
anoth
year
or
so
in
mn
dalla
gave
green
a
pretti
stellar
deal
to
play
there
although
i
feel
minnesota
wa
quit
reason
and
he
also
ha
some
croni
down
there
a
well
all
thi
mean
is
that
minnesota
is
without
an
nhl
team
for
a
year
or
two
too
bad
for
the
nhl
kea
