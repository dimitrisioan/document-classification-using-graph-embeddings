paul

is
the
worst
and
most
bias
ref
present
in
the
nhl
we
wa
rob
no
patrick
roy
is
the
reason
the
game
wa
lost
and
ron
hextal
is
the
reason
quebec
won
i
dont
buy
thi
at
all
roy
wa
the
reason
the
game
wa
tie
and
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
dionn
kept
hi
cool
roy
stood
on
hi
head
for
the
first
minut
of
the
game
when
the
nord
were
rush
from
endtoend
kamenski
minibreak
after
the
tie
goal
and
the
first
shot
by
young
in
ot
were
both
excel
chanc
stop
by
roy
roy
outplay
hextal
for
most
of
the
game
but
roy
becom
the
villain
and
hextal
the
hero
becaus
roy
team
didnt
make
full
use
of
their
opportun
whoa
what
you
are
effect
do
is
impli
that
if
a
player
play
realli
well
he
store
up
mistak
that
can
be
use
at
a
later
time
th
is
not
so
roy
is
the
villain
a
you
so
succinctli
put
it
becaus
he
allow
a
veri
cheap
goal
if
you
think
roy
outplay
hextal
perhap
you
should
get
a
tape
of
the
game
and
watch
the
first
minut
of
the
third
period
nhl
goaltend
make
some
great
save
if
they
did
not
they
would
not
be
in
the
nhl
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
expect
ani
particular
goali
to
be
abl
to
make
the
great
save
all
of
the
time
even
though
they
are
occasion
requir
howev
when
it
come
to
a
routin
shot
like
sakic
especi
at
such
a
crucial
time
in
a
game
i
dont
think
there
are
ani
legitim
excus
hextal
on
the
other
hand
had
a
lot
of
lucki
bounc
descript
of
lucki
bounc
hextal
wasnt
particularli
brilliant
on
those
play
i
am
not
argu
that
hextal
wa
brilliant
i
am
argu
is
that
a
rel
weak
wrist
shot
from
the
outsid
of
the
circl
shold
not
result
in
a
goal
but
it
wa
just
the
goal
the
time
stank
but
against
an
explos
team
like
quebec
they
gave
them
opportun
too
mani
with
a
powerplay
that
wa
total
unnecessari
in
a
onego
game
with
le
than
a
minut
to
go
there
is
no
such
thing
a
just
the
goal
i
have
not
defend
dionn
for
take
the
penalti
eitherin
fact
i
think
it
wa
a
bonehead
move
but
it
led
to
one
goal
onli
and
montreal
had
a
two
goal
lead
my
main
concern
is
the
second
goal
thi
most
certainli
wa
a
team
loss
leclair
miss
hi
opportun
a
did
bellow
and
brunet
dionn
took
a
bad
penalti
damphouss
and
lebeau
were
silent
carbonneau
and
savard
were
a
step
behind
all
night
roy
gave
up
the
bad
goal
roy
by
no
mean
can
be
singl
out
for
thi
loss
what
you
say
about
the
skater
is
absolut
true
but
realiz
that
the
game
wa
effect
won
you
could
watch
ani
hockey
game
in
fact
you
could
watch
ani
sport
event
period
and
spend
hour
discuss
the
what
if
wrt
miss
opportun
they
are
not
import
when
the
final
result
is
decid
if
i
get
the
time
soon
ill
watch
the
game
again
and
email
you
a
list
of
lucki
montreal
bounc
and
a
list
of
quebec
offens
screwup
montreal
wa
lead
with
a
minut
to
go
the
goali
is
the
last
line
of
defenc
and
i
will
grant
that
extra
attent
is
focuss
on
him
sometim
without
justif
but
roy
gave
up
a
lousi
goal
and
a
team
can
not
afford
such
a
goal
roy
look
like
a
player
in
an
industri
leagu
on
sakic
shot
and
hextal
didnt
on
dionn
goal
pleas
who
care
of
what
valu
is
it
to
justifi
one
lousi
play
with
a
total
unrel
lousi
play
i
could
do
a
hextal
critiqu
if
youd
like
but
if
your
go
to
ass
hi
perform
keep
in
mind
that
he
made
the
key
save
at
the
key
time
roy
is
paid
big
money
becaus
that
is
hi
valu
compar
to
other
goali
and
he
still
is
in
the
top
for
the
record
i
did
not
say
that
roy
wa
not
one
of
the
top
goaltend
in
the
leagu
in
fact
i
agre
that
he
is
the
montreal
medium
is
the
quickest
to
heap
prais
and
then
hurl
derogatori
comment
against
the
hab
they
are
no
better
than
uninform
fan
i
assum
you
are
refer
to
me
howev
i
have
point
out
that
i
think
the
loss
can
be
blame
on
roy
i
have
not
said
he
suck
nor
do
i
think
ive
made
ani
other
derogatori
comment
if
you
regard
object
and
inform
fyi
observ
a
derogatori
i
realli
cant
help
you
