re
ron
franci
matthew
rush
write
is
there
an
award
for
best
backup
behind
a
hockey
great
underneath
all
the
hype
about
lemieux
steven
jagr
ulf
etc
ron
franci
ha
quietli
put
togeth
a
point
season
goal
and
assist
in
game
that
wa
probabl
the
best
acquisit
the
penguin
have
made
sinc
get
lemieux
apolog
to
rick
tocchet
who
ha
had
a
hell
of
a
year
himself
the
pen
got
just
the
right
person
at
just
the
right
time
when
they
got
franci
befor
the
playoff
two
year
ago
to
backup
mario
who
wa
the
secondlin
center
befor
they
got
franci
i
rememb
randi
gilhen
who
realli
play
tough
an
ace
in
the
faceoff
circl
but
nobodi
with
all
the
skill
franci
ha
score
pass
win
faceoff
and
put
into
everi
game
everi
night
just
want
to
glow
a
littl
i
know
what
you
mean
i
glow
everytim
ronni
out
on
the
ice
in
fact
one
of
the
neatest
thing
about
see
the
pen
in
person
is
that
i
can
key
in
on
him
instead
of
watch
what
id
probabl
be
see
on
tv
he
doe
so
mani
subtl
thing
behind
the
play
he
said
in
an
interview
recent
that
when
he
wa
a
kid
hi
dad
stress
the
import
of
play
twoway
hockey
that
you
have
to
learn
how
to
play
defens
a
well
a
offens
and
he
obvious
took
that
advic
to
heart
he
wa
a
breath
of
fresh
air
when
he
arriv
in
pittsburgh
to
the
team
whose
forward
for
the
most
part
couldnt
and
wouldnt
play
a
lick
of
defens
it
realli
difficult
to
ass
what
the
key
trade
were
that
brought
all
of
thi
success
to
the
pen
you
mention
rick
tocchet
and
he
ha
certainli
help
and
even
ol
kjell
ha
been
steadi
but
look
at
thi
team
you
could
almost
take
ani
one
of
them
out
of
the
lineup
perman
and
replac
them
with
an
extrem
mediocr
player
and
it
wouldnt
matter
if
i
had
to
pick
the
top
three
acquisit
in
recent
year
they
would
be
tom
barrasso
ron
franci
larri
murphi
id
love
to
put
franci
first
but
i
do
think
the
onli
thing
that
could
realli
damag
the
pen
right
now
would
be
to
lose
barrasso
mom
