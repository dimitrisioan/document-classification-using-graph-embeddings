are
an
integr
part
of
ani
team
and
that
is
simpli
becaus
there
are
not
enough
solid
twoway
player
to
go
around
who
would
you
rather
have
a
your
check
centr
doug
gilmour
or
doug
jarvi
for
that
matter
i
would
take
either
gretzki
or
mario
a
my
check
centr
do
you
think
gretzki
could
cover
bob
gainey
gretzki
lemieux
gilmour
etc
do
not
play
the
role
of
check
centreman
they
play
an
offens
role
a
oppos
to
a
defens
one
if
they
were
use
a
defens

it
would
be
a
wast
of
their
offens
abil
when
you
compar
gretzki
et
al
to

gainey
etc
you
are
compar
appl
and
orang
it
is
like
me
tell
you
that
felix
potvin
isnt
veri
good
becaus
a
team
would
be
better
if
the
had
lemieux
instead
of
him
sure
lemieux
is
a
better
player
but
he
is
a
differ
type
of
player
for
a
team
to
be
success
they
need
to
have
all
type
of
player
thi
includ
defens
forward
when
compar
with
other
defens
forward
bob
gainey
is
the
greatest
defens
forward
ever
he
is
the
player
who
talent
best
suit
be
a
defens
forward
who
complet
domin
the
game
when
he
play
mayb
if
a
more
talent
player
such
a
gretzki
had
decid
to
wast
hi
offens
talent
and
play
defens
he
could
have
been
a
better
defens

but
he
wasnt
bob
