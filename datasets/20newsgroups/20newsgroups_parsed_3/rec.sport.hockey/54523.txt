write
when
you
think
of
the
nhl
who
come
to
mind
gilmour
gretzki
mario
ah
did
i
mention
mario
if
you
said
gretzki
you
havent
realli
been
follow
along
have
you
if
you
said
gilmour
you
are
a
true
maynard
i
dont
even
think
the
select
of
the
hart
deserv
seriou
discus
on
thi
group
it
is
a
nobrain
while
i
agre
that
lemieux
deserv
the
hart
it
is
far
from
a
nobrain
the
hart
trophi
goe
to
the
player
most
valuabl
to
hi
team
not
to
the
best
player
in
the
leagu
so
your
abov
arguement
is
realli
worthless
the
pen
without
mario
are
still
a
damn
good
hockey
team
the
leaf
without
gilmour
would
have
been
fight
tampa
bay
for
the
rd
pick
like
i
said
mario
deserv
it
imho
but
it
is
a
veri
close
race
and
a
gilmour
victori
would
not
surpris
me
i
dislik
doug
gilmour
with
a
passion
but
i
must
conced
that
he
is
extrem
valuabl
to
the
leaf
