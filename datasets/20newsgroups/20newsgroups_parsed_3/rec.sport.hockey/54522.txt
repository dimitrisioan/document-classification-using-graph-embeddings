i
dont
think
the
shark
should
dig
into
the
free
agent
market
most
of
the
good
free
agent
will
requir
quit
a
bit
of
compens
and
set
the
shark
back
a
far
a
player
develop
goe
rememb
the
shark
were
unwil
to
give
up
player
in
addit
to
the
million
they
offer
for
joe
murphi
and
i
think
that
a
good
approach
they
tri
to
sign
sergei
makarov
befor
thi
season
becaus
makarov
wouldnt
have
requir
compens
match
the
makarov
offer
wa
the
onli
real
mistak
dave
king
ha
made
thi
year
i
have
to
wonder
about
the
intellig
of
sign
a
year
old
who
is
obvious
on
the
downsid
of
hi
career
to
a
year
million
contract
risebrough
match
the
offer
on
king
request
and
makarov
ha
spent
the
last
quarter
of
the
season
in
the
press
box
becaus
hi
work
ethic
just
plain
stink
not
to
mention
that
he
lost
a
step
and
can
no
longer
get
himself
into
posit
to
make
the
nifti
pas
i
think
makarov
will
be
avail
for
free
thi
offseason
to
anybodi
who
agre
to
pay
hi
contract
he
ineffect
in
calgari
but
he
might
be
abl
to
help
a
team
like
san
jose
with
their
shortag
of
talent
if
there
no
taker
and
makarov
doesnt
show
improv
in
train
camp
i
think
the
flame
will
just
bite
the
bullet
and
buy
out
makarov
contract
and
releas
him
with
hi
current
attitud
he
is
a
detriment
to
the
team
