re
wing
will
win
greg
ballentin
write
all
of
thi
is
fine
i
never
said
that
murray
wa
a
bad
gm
i
mere
said
that
he
isnt
the
best
gm
in
hockey
or
even
a
contend
for
that
honor
if
murray
is
a
great
a
you
claim
the
wing
would
have
won
the
stanley
cup
by
now
probabl
more
than
onc
if
he
wa
a
great
a
gm
a
you
claim
i
think
you
miss
one
of
my
point
there
it
take
more
than
a
great
gm
to
win
a
stanley
cup
even
onc
some
of
the
guy
on
the
list
you
gave
earlier
never
won
one
i
agre
that
you
and
i
could
probabl
argu
back
and
forth
for
day
to
no
avail
about
who
is
the
best
gm
in
hockey
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
who
is
to
say
my
opinion
is
ani
better
than
your
or
your
than
mine
but
the
point
of
my
origin
origin
post
if
not
well
state
wa
that
murray
ha
the
gm
abil
but
not
the
coach
abil
which
lead
to
below
and
he
wa
a
poor
a
coach
a
you
claim
he
would
have
been
intellig
enough
to
hire
the
coach
to
push
the
team
to
the
next
level
of
success
i
think
at
thi
point
there
a
person
emot
element
involv
here
which
transcend
murray
logic
thought
a
outsid
it
fine
for
u
to
say
he
should
hire
a
differ
coach
in
fact
he
ha
talk
about
do
so
in
the
past
but
the
press
here
in
detroit
at
least
ha
so
built
up
thi
busi
about
murray
never
get
past
the
second
round
of
the
playoff
a
a
coach
that
i
think
he
ha
taken
it
upon
himself
to
prove
to
the
world
that
he
is
capabl
of
coach
a
team
past
the
second
round
he
need
to
a
the
paper
say
get
that
monkey
off
hi
back
so
it
becom
a
matter
not
of
intellig
but
of
pride
is
it
foolish
to
let
pride
stand
in
the
way
of
sound
logic
perhap
but
were
all
a
littl
that
way
from
time
to
time
i
think
eventu
hell
step
down
from
behind
the
bench
and
concentr
on
hi
gm
duti
and
the
team
will
improv
a
a
result
i
think
hi
coach
duti
take
away
time
he
might
have
otherwis
spent
on
gm
work
in
that
sens
onc
he
step
down
a
coach
well
see
how
good
of
a
gm
he
realli
is
but
murray
is
an
averag
unspectacular
nhl
coach
and
a
pretti
good
gm
so
none
of
thi
is
true
anyway
i
may
not
agre
with
everyth
youv
said
but
it
been
fun
discuss
it
with
you
gregmeist
