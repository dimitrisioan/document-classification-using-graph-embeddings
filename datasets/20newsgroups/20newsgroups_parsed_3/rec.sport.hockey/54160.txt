time
and
from
the
volum
of
post
about
him
someon
sure
is
get
a
steadi
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is

the
deal
with
him

comment
of

on
playoff
season
after
the
rocki
were
elimin
read
about

the
net
mere
flame
bait
or

peopl
actual
take
him
serious

id
say
it
a
combin
of
flame
bait
and
seriou
journal
the
closest
thing
youll
find
to
cherri
in
the
u
is
stan
fischler
a
selfdescrib
hockey
maven
the
similar
are
that
they

the
differ
is
that

mayb
im
miss
someth
don
a
charact
if
he
were

ration
and
noncontroversi
he
wouldnt
have
a
job
by
some
definit
he
could
be
call
an
as

the
same
about

they
leaf
the
best
team
but
