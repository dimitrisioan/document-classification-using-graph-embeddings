sabr
quot
bill
gregori
to
all
bg
hey
i
saw
that
game
i
thought
the
sabr
look
better
that
you
bg
describ
it
boston
that
look
weak
and
unsur
of
themselv
even
bg
if
big
if
they
bruin
win
the
third
game
what
that
go
to
bg
prove
they
be
lucki
well
now
the
sabr
are
up
in
game
and
it
to
bad
that
boston
isnt
put
up
more
of
a
fight
a
that
could
have
been
the
best
seri
of
the
playoff
i
think
boston
will
come
out
smoke
in
the
next
two
game
and
that
buffalo
will
end
the
seri
in
game
six
back
in
buffalo
and
say
how
about
those
island
they
are
up
on
the
capit
and
will
probabl
win
the
seri
onli
to
be
clobber
by
the
penguin
who
should
elimin
the
devil
in
the
next
game

sad
to
