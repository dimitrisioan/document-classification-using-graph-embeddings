if
you
were
pat
burn
what
are
the
leaf
to
do
i
am
a
leaf
support
and
i
say
the
leaf
are
go
down
in
four
unless
there
is
noth
short
of
a
miracl
or
a
stroke
of
geneniu
hit
pat
burn
if
you
were
pat
burn
what
would
you
do
live
in
the
bay
area
i
do
not
get
enough
leaf
coverag
to
pull
someth
out
of
the
bag
i
would
appreci
comment
on
the
leafdetroit
rd
line
matchup
but
here
is
the
basic
idea
andreychuck
and
borchevski
have
no
busi
play
against
the
wing
they
are
too
small
the
key
to
ani
leaf
success
will
have
to
be
clark
he
is
the
onli
centr
who
can
have
ani
presenc
within
stick
length
of
the
slot
where
the
hell
is
anderson
anderson
can
in
day
past
get
under
peopl
skin
put
a
littl
more
bluntli
anderson
ha
to
be
an
asshol
he
use
to
be
good
at
it
we
need
him
now
perhap
perhap
the
leaf
can
shut
down
detroit
second
line
i
wa
dissappoint
to
see
shepard
and
yserbeart
fli
last
night
these
guy
are
the
swing
player
for
the
wing
last
year
they
did
a
major
choke
in
the
playoff
and
were
to
blame
for
the
quick
exit
of
the
wing
thi
ha
to
happen
again
clarkandersongilmour
should
be
abl
to
out
hustl
thi
line
anderson
should
do
a
nasti
on
yserbeart
clark
should
bang
the
hell
out
of
sheppard
score
gilmour
score
suggest
clarkeandersongilmour
v
sheppardyserbeart
andreychuckborchevsi
v
detroit
check
line
toronto
check
line
v
yzermanfedorovprobert
pray
lot
a
suggest
i
would
bench
andreychuck
and
borchevski
to
stir
thing
up
and
through
a
monkey
wrench
into
detroit
game
plan
howev
if
the
detroit
coach
would
be
dumb
enough
to
play
their
check
line
against
these
finess
player
well
then
let
them
play
potvin
can
not
be
fault
on
of
the
goal
keep
him
in
van
hellamond
can
not
be
fault
for
the
leaf
demis
either
the
wing
defens
shut
down
the
leaf
especi
in
the
slot
i
hope
pat
burn
realiz
that
hi
team
wa
outhit
outskat
and
outcoach
on
monday
night
thi
wa
not
a
