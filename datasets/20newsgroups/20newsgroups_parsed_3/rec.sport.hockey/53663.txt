in

randi
a
graca
write
i
also
think
that
they
will
have
a
hard
time
with
pittsburgh
if
they
face
them
in
the
final
which
is
what
all
the
detroit
sportswrit
are
predict
although
i
think
bryan
murray
is
probabl
the
best
gm
i
have
ever
seen
in
hockey
how
do
you
figur
that
when
bryan
murray
took
over
the
wing
they
were
a
pretti
good
team
that
wa
contend
for
the
stanley
cup
but
look
unlik
to
win
it
now
they
are
a
pretti
good
team
that
is
contend
for
the
stanley
cup
but
look
unlik
to
win
it
a
truli
great
gm
would
have
been
abl
to
make
the
move
to
push
the
team
to
the
upper
echelon
of
the
nhl
and
mayb
win
the
stanley
cup
a
good
gm
like
murray
can
maintain
the
team
success
but
cant
push
them
to
the
next
level
in
the
histori
of
hockey
there
have
been
sever
better
gm
than
murray
way
too
mani
to
name
murray
isnt
even
the
best
gm
in
the
leagu
today
he
fail
in
comparison
to
sinden
sather
savard
caron
fletcher
and
quinn
in
my
estim
i
cant
imagin
how
bryan
murray
can
be
the
best
gm
anyon
ha
ever
seen
in
hockey
unless
they
have
seen
veri
few
gm
