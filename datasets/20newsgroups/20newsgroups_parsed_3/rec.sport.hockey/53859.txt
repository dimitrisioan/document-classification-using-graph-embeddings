re
the
hawk
will
return
to
the
final
in
articl
brian
johnson
write
well
now
that
the
hawk
have
won
the
divis
the
road
is
a
littl
easier
for
the
playoff
let
toronto
and
detroit
beat
the
hell
out
of
each
other
while
chicago
sweep
stloui
that
just
make
it
easier
in
the
second
round
with
all
the
rest
they
will
get
and
tordet
get
none
for
the
conf
champ
they
will
have
a
hard
time
versu
the
divis
but
that
div
will
be
pretti
batter
also
so
the
advantag
go
to
the
hawk
again
then
bring
pitt
and
sure
the
hawk
will
probabl
lose
but
it
better
to
get
that
far
and
lose
than
to
not
go
brian
hope
a
miracl
ok
not
quit
a
miracl
but
close
will
occur
and
pittsburgh
will
be
elmin
prior
to
the
final
if
they
make
it
again
they
will
probabl
keep
the
cup
if
they
dont
it
the
hawk
turn
go
blackhawk

to
