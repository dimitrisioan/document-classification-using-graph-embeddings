off
the
first
half
hour
of

the
solut
to
your
problem
move
to
canada
yesterday
i
wa
abl
to
watch

gamesth
njpitt
at
on
abc
lacal
at
cbc
buffbo
at
tsn
and

a
pure
guess

i
set
them
up
sidebysid
to
watch
monqu
and
keep
an
eye
on
bosbuff
at
the
same
time
i
did
the
same
for
the
two
afternoon
game
btw
those
abc
commentat
were
great
i
wa
quit
impress
they
seem
to
know
that
their
audienc
wasnt
like
to
be
wellschool
in
hockey
lore
and
they
did
an
excel
job
they
were
quit
imparti

suffer
from
a
shortag
of
hockey
