interview
note
that
he
tri
to
say
someth
to
hawerchuk
but
the
crowd
wa
too
loud
even
though
he
wa
shout
it
didnt
seem
to
matter
a
most
of
the
sabr
and
even
muckler
said
it
wa
great
yuri
khmylev
didnt
seem
to
realiz
that
he
wa
the
game
third
star
and
didnt
skate
out
when
hi
name
wa
call
sweeney
and
fuhr
each
were
out
befor
yuri
made
hi
appear
san
jersey
when
ask
in
an
interview
later
whether
he
knew
how
big
a
goal
that
wa
he
respon
ye
ok
it
wa
through
an
interpret
and
he
said
more
than
that
even
more
than
the
interpret
said
but
i
digress
the
interview
seem
to
think
just
becaus
he
doesnt
speak
english
he
must
not
understand
playoff
