i
watch
the
game

in
wc
todayand
i
wa
astonish
about
the
behaviour
of
the
german
audienc
the
german
team
got
a
few
penalti
in
the
last
period
and
the
crowd
went
grazi
they
threw
coin
extra
puck
and
other
trash
into
the
rinki
that
stupid
or
what
i
guess
the
canadian
refere
one
of
the
isostarbro
gave
the
german
team
a
penalti
for
that
but
it
didnt
help
much
i
guess
the
german
just
are
proud
over
their
nazikillemalleveryon
butusgermanssuck
attitudethey
just
seem
to
have
that
kind
of
attitud
in
everi
possibl
sport
rememb
the
european
champ
in
stockholm
in
soccer
it
realli
piss
me
off
i
do
not
mean
that
everi
singl
german
ha
thi
attitud
that
suck
but
most
of
them
seem
to
do
i
can
understand
your
anger
about
the
german
audienc
i
mean
it
wa
the
finnish
team
they
play
and
they
were
take
advantag
of
the
ridicul
penalti
the
canadien
ref
call
in
the
last
period
the
german
got
a
match
penalti
and
a
minut
misconduct
for
practic
noth
and
second
after
that
the
german
goali
got
two
minut
for
delay
of
game
for
a
shot
that
wa
deflect
and
went
into
the
crowd
the
result
skate
advantag
lead
to
the
decid
goal
at
a
point
when
the
german
were
start
to
come
up
strong
i
am
also
sick
of
the
nation
that
is
go
on
in
german
sport
event
if
you
watch
for
exampl
a
tenni
davi
cup
match
the
player
are
often
not
abl
to
play
for
minut
becaus
the
crowd
is
so
obnoxi
but
i
have
to
admit
that
thi
kind
of
nation
is
a
strong
or
even
stronger
in
most
other
countri
you
should
go
to
the
u
and
watch
the
way
they
present
the
olymp
on
televis
or
the
soccer
crowd
in
england
or
the
finnish
spectat
at
nordic
ski
event
i
mean
it
make
me
sick
to
see
all
thi
nation
all
over
the
world
and
i
would
rather
see
the
best
teamplay
win
and
get
chear
at
i
do
not
mind
if
my
favorit
team
loo
to
somebodi
that
is
better
or
play
more
attract
and
i
have
to
admit
that
in
most
sport
the
german
nation
site
is
not
my
favorit
team
to
watch
the
german
soccer
team
is
bore
to
watch
for
exampl
but
read
the
abov
post
i
think
that
you
are
on
the
same
level
a
these
crowd
you
are
critic
it
is
easi
to
talk
of
nearli
all
german
a
nazi
and
nationalist
that
the
kind
of
propaganda
that
all
ultraconserv
peopl
use
against
germani
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
great
danger
of
rearis
nation
in
germani
but
from
my
experi
most
of
the
peopl
at
least
of
the
peopl
that
i
know
also
regard
thi
a
a
big
threat
and
are
tri
to
demonstr
thi
attitud
now
whi
cant
we
just
look
at
peopl
a
human
bee
and
not
tri
to
put
them
into
drawer
correspond
to
their
nation
eg
all
russian
are
communist
all
american
are
capitalist
all
german
are
nazi
all
fin
are
hang
around
bee
drunk
on
ferri
in
my
opinion
your
comment
show
the
narrow
of
your
mind
and
that
you
dont
seem
to
be
differ
from
the
nazi
you
are
talk
about
thoma
there
no
time
to
hate
bare
time
to
wait
