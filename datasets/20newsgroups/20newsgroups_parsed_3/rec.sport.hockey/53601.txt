see
thi
game
last
night
just
like
a
playoff
game
lot
of
hittingbut
i
wa
disappoint
by
the
video

on

joe
murphi
goal
shouldnt
have
count
it
didnt
go
in
net
and
accord
to
the
tsn
broadcast
the
video
goal
judg
said
that
he
saw
the
water
bottl
on
top
of
the
cage
move
so
he
assum
the
puck
went
in
thi
is
terriblehop
crap
like
thi
doesnt
occur
in
the
playoff
the
game
would
have
end
in
tie
i
thought
the
red
light
went
onthu
in
the
review
the
presumpt
would
be
to
find
conclus
evid
that
the
puck
did
not
go
in
the
netfrom
the
replay
i
say
even
from
the
rear
the
evid
wasnt
conclus
that
the
puck
wa
in
or
outin
my
opinion
it
seem
pretti
conclus
to
me
the
puck
clearli
hit
the
crossbar
and
then
came
down
on
the
line
and
the
announc
admittedli
homer
kept
harp
about
how
they
must
have
had
a
differ
view
upstair
becaus
it
wa
obviou
to
them
and
i
would
have
thought
to
anyon
who
saw
the
replay
that
the
puck
didnt
go
in
the
refere
origin
signal
no
goal
but
the
video
replay
judg
initi
contact
with
the
refere
to
claim
that
a
goal
wa
in
fact
score
thi
to
me
is
unheard
of
see
stuff
like
thi
happen
give
me
a
bad
feel
about
the
leaf
chanc
thi
year
cordial
