randi
a
graca
write
are
predict
although
i
think
bryan
murray
is
probabl
the
best
gm
i
have
ever
seen
in
hockey
how
do
you
figur
that
when
bryan
murray
took
over
the
wing
they
were
a
pretti
good
team
that
wa
contend
for
the
stanley
cup
but
look
unlik
to
win
it
now
they
are
a
pretti
good
team
that
is
contend
for
the
stanley
cup
but
look
unlik
to
win
it
a
truli
great
gm
would
have
been
abl
to
make
the
move
to
push
the
team
to
the
upper
echelon
of
the
nhl
and
mayb
win
the
stanley
cup
a
good
gm
like
murray
can
i
think
murray
ha
done
a
great
job
he
pick
up
ciccarelli
sheppard
ysebaert
howe
coffey
and
riendeau
plu
some
depth
player
without
give
up
anyth
the
wing
need
or
ani
of
hi
top
prospect
all
of
thi
in
three
year
ha
anyon
done
better
the
year
befor
he
took
over
the
wing
didnt
even
make
the
playoff
there
wa
about
a
year
and
a
half
dure
demer
stint
that
the
wing
did
ok
but
that
wa
due
to
demer
motav
skill
and
clutch
and
grab
style
they
didnt
have
much
talent
gerald
murray
wasnt
respons
for
primeau
although
im
not
readi
to
admit
that
a
horribl
pick
they
hire
him
after
the
draft
which
ha
never
made
sen
to
me
hi
first
pick
wa
lapoint
ron
and
one
of
my
major
goal
is
to
leav
the
next
presid
a
new
set
of
thing
to
worri
about
im
get
bore
read
the
same
problem
in

want
