the
blue
led
by
the
best
goali
in

nhl
thi

curti
joseph
shutout
the
hawk
the
blue
are
play
like
they
did
in
clutch
n
grab
shoot
the
puck
out
it
incred
bore
to
watch
but
if
it
work
final
a
non
blue
fan
agre
that
joseph
is
a
great
goali
i
think
he
should
win
the
vezina
thi
year
or
at
least
share
it
with
barrasso
who
also
ha
been
shadow
by
mario
amaz
perform
i
too
think
that
joseph
ha
had
a
great
year
and
should
be
consid
for
the
vezina
i
think
barrasso
and
joseph
should
be
the
two
strongest
candid
thi
year
i
dont
believ
all
of
the
hype
that
roy
belfour
and
now
potvin
receiv
for
their
goaltend
i
do
think
that
they
are
great
in
the
net
but
i
would
rather
have
curti
tommi
or
fuhr
in
the
net
dure
thi
year
playoff
the
big
name
tender
alway
seem
to
have
a
strong
defens
in
front
of
them
and
the
goaltend
get
the
most
credit
i
would
rather
face
shot
a
game
than
have
to
reli
on
joseph
save
but
if
the
goali
is
go
to
face
shot
i
would
rather
have
joseph
or
barrasso
face
them
jay
p
go
quebec
and
i
know
that
mclean
and
sever
other
should
be
mention
a
candid
for
thi
year
vezina
but
i
am
partial
to
joseph
and
