subject
re
thi
year
biggest
and
worst
opinion
i
can
onli
comment
on
the
king
but
the
most
obviou
candid
for
pleasant
surpris
is
alex
zhitnik
he
came
highli
tout
a
a
defens
defenseman
but
he
clearli
much
more
than
that
great
skater
and
hard
shot
though
wish
he
were
more
accur
in
fact
he
pretti
much
allow
the
king
to
trade
away
that
huge
defens
liabil
paul
coffey
kelli
hrudey
is
onli
the
biggest
disappoint
if
you
thought
he
wa
ani
good
to
begin
with
but
at
best
he
onli
a
mediocr
goaltend
a
better
choic
would
be
toma
sandstrom
though
not
through
ani
fault
of
hi
own
but
becaus
some
thug
in
toronto
decid
to
threaten
hi
career
in
order
to
avoid
conced
a
goal
other
than
that
the
award
goe
to
robert
lang
an
uninspir
czech
robitail
could
easili
be
mvp
but
id
prefer
to
give
it
to
rob
blake
who
is
quietli
becom
one
of
the
leagu
premier
defensemen
and
if
the
king
manag
to
hold
onto
him
and
the
rest
of
our
young
defens
it
could
one
day
mean
that
well
let
in
fewer
goal
than
hartford
honor
mention
to
majest
marti
and
warren
rychel
jon
