espn
in
articl
robert
andolina
write
the
thing
that
confus
me
most
about
espn
is
that
they
decid
to
show
the
penguin
and
devil
again
on
thursday
night
be
that
both
of
the
first
two
game
were
domin
by
pitt
you
would
think
that
they
would
show
a
differ
game
thi
is
in
addit
to
the
fact
that
they
should
show
other
game
just
for
the
sake
of
fair
exposur
nesn
own
the
right
to
bruin
telecast
i
suspect
that
nesn
wa
onli
go
to
sell
one
telecast
to
espn
rememb
espn
onli
own
exclus
right
to
the
final
not
the
entir
playoff
sinc
espn
bought
the
sca
contract
there
are
le
wrangl
to
unti
with
show
the
devil
and
penguin
also
some
of
you
should
know
that
a
far
a
i
can
tell
espn
is
not
go
to
show
campbel
confer
game
regularli
in
the
first
two
round
i
believ
that
they
are
onli
go
to
show
campbel
game
in
the
first
two
round
a
those
seri
wear
on
game
or
perhap
game
i
think
the
same
broadcast
right
factor
come
into
it
plu
they
have
no
way
of
fit
western
game
time
into
their
current
schedul
unless
the
nhl
wa
will
to
make
a
western

think
the

much
a

could
when
it
shuffl
the
