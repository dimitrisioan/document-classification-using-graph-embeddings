write
greg
ballentin
write
lot
of
debat
about
the
virtu
of
bryan
murray
v
pat
quinn
a
a
gm
delet
randi
graca
seem
to
think
murray
is
the
best
gm
in
the
leagu
i
think
quinn
is
one
of
sever
who
are
better
plu
hi
team
quinn
ha
improv
a
much
greater
amount
than
detroit
sinc
he
took
over
with
them
how
do
you
figur
both
vancouv
and
detroit
did
the
same
thing
last
year
they
both
won
their
divis
they
had
close
to
the
same
number
of
point
they
both
went
down
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoff
befor
final
escap
in
game
and
they
both
got
knock
out
in
the
second
round
by
team
they
should
have
been
abl
to
beat
with
le
talent
specif
if
i
rememb
correctli
third
place
team
how
doe
thi
make
vancouv
more
improv
further
if
im
not
mistaken
the
wing
had
more
point
than
vancouv
at
the
end
of
thi
season
albeit
not
mani
when
quinn
took
over
vancouv
sever
year
ago
not
last
year
they
regularili
miss
the
playoff
i
cant
recal
if
they
miss
the
playoff
the
year
befor
hi
hire
but
they
probabl
did
quinn
ha
improv
the
team
from
nonplayoff
calibr
to
a
seriou
contend
when
murray
took
over
in
detroit
the
were
about
a
team
that
wa
a
contend
to
win
the
norri
divis
and
possibl
even
a
stanley
cup
contend
so
quinn
ha
improv
hi
team
more
than
murray
ha
sinc
take
over
a
a
gm
quinn
is
one
exampl
of
a
better
gm
than
murray
gregmeist
