the
chanc
that
these
fan
will
becom
fanat
i
am
glad
that
the
name
are
be
chang
for
anoth
reason
the
name
patrick
smyth
norri
adam
and
campbel
are
all
the
name
of
socal
builder
of
the
game
thi
is
the
same
type
of
think
that
put
stein
in
the
hall
of
fame
thi
is
absolut
nonsens
the
real
builder
of
the
game
are
richard
morenz
howe
conach
orr
etc
if
you
are
go
to
name
the
divis
after
peopl
at
least
name
the
divis
after
peopl
who
deserv
it
i
think
that
you
are
incorrect
roger
patrick
smyth
and
adam
all
play
or
coach
in
the
leagu
befor
becom
front
offic
type
henc
they
did
help
build
the
leagu
although
they
were
not
great
player
themselv
i
agre
that
a
name
is
a
name
is
a
name
and
if
some
peopl
have
troubl
with
name
that
are
not
easili
process
by
the
fan
then
chang
them
to
name
that
are
more
easili
process
seem
like
a
reason
idea
if
we
can
get
peopl
in
the
arena
door
by
be
uncompl
then
let
do
so
onc
we
have
them
they
will
realiz
what
a
great
game
hockey
is
and
we
can
then
teach
them
someth
abotu
the
histori
of
the
game
the
histori
of
the
name
can
be
put
rather
succinctli
all
of
the
aforemen
tion
use
the
game
of
hockey
to
make
money
can
you
imagin
a
pocklington
divis
a
ballard
divis
or
how
about
a
green
divis
no
i
would
not
want
to
see
a
ballard
divis
but
to
say
that
these
owner
are
asshol
henc
all
nhl
manag
peopl
are
asshol
would
be
fallaci
conn
smyth
for
exampl
wa
a
classi
individu
from
what
i
have
heard
also
isnt
the
point
of
profession
hockey
to
make
money
for
all
those
involv
which
would
includ
the
player
what
i
think
you
might
be
say
is
that
the
player
have
not
made
a
much
money
a
should
have
been
their
due
and
it
is
the
player
that
are
what
make
the
game
great
not
the
peopl
who
put
them
on
the
ice
so
name
divis
after
manag
peopl
rather
than
player
is
ad
insult
in
the
form
of
lesser
recognit
to
injuri
le
money
than
wa
