re
playoff
predict
in
articl
carol
v
boudreau
write
in
the
smyth
thi
one
is
the
toughest
for
me
to
call
becaus
i
have
to
put
person
bia
asid
go
calgari
i
think
a
lot
depend
on
who
win
the
divis
winnipeg
will
move
into
third
by
the
end
of
the
season
and
the
first
place
winner
will
have
a
clear
advantag
it
will
be
a
lot
easier
to
build
momentum
against
a
team
like
the
king
whoever
play
the
king
in
the
first
round
will
take
the
divis
much
a
it
hurt
i
have
to
pick
divis
winner
vancouv
canuck
ill
have
to
disagre
with
you
on
thi
one
i
think
vancouv
will
go
a
bure
go
and
if
he
continu
on
hi
goal
score
slump
then
they
wont
even
make
it
out
of
the
first
round
i
think
the
king
will
make
it
out
of
the
first
round
regardless
of
who
they
play
they
seem
to
be
do
pretti
well
even
with
that
bad
game
against
minnesota
on
saturday
i
think
itll
be
either
calgari
or
lo
angel
to
win
the
smyth
ie
go
on
to
the
confer
final
wale
confer
trophi
island
and
bruin
will
fight
to
the
end
but
i
think
the
island
have
enough
steam
to
overtak
the
bruin
in
seven
campbel
confer
trophi
a
walk
for
vancouv
mayb
in
or
but
defin
not
stanley
cup
final
island
and
vancouv
island
will
have
noth
left
by
thi
point
and
will
succumb
fairli
easili
to
the
canuck
stanley
cup
champion
vancouv
canuck
still
have
to
disagre
with
you
here
i
think
itll
be
pittsburg
to
get
the
hat
trick
in
stanley
cup
they
just
look
toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
good
i
hope
you
have
enjoy
my
predict
i
hope
they
are
not
all
correct
go
calgari
neither
do
i
well
may
the
best
team
win
it
all
pittsburg
that
just
my
worth
messag
from
the
termin
of
carol
boudreau
