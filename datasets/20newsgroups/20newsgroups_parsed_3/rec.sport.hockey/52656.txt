richard
john
rauser
write
here
the
point
there
are
far
too
mani
european
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watch
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
let
say
the
red
wing
and
the
canuck
and
see
name
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshki
is
thi
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularli
annoy
but
the
number
of
euro
on
other
team
is
get
wors
a
well
gee
youd
think
winnipeg
would
be
top
on
that
list
what
with
regular
be
european
i
live
in
vancouv
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
complet
throw
up
a
it
is
now
everi
time
i
see
the
canuck
play
i
keep
hope
someon
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carri
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canuck
fan
to
begin
with
well
be
a
jet
fan
i
sometim
wish
that
bure
would
get
knock
silli
too
noth
seriou
just
enough
to
keep
him
out
of
a
game
okay
the
stretcher
remark
wa
a
littl
carri
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owner
draft
all
these
european
instead
of
canadian
and
some
american
it
deni
young
canadian
the
opportun
to
play
in
their
north
american
leagu
and
instead
give
it
to
european
who
arent
even
better
hockey
player
it
all
hype
thi
european
mystiqu
is
sicken
but
until
nhl
owner
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
player
will
continu
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
draft
into
their
own
leagu
in
most
case
the
owner
have
veri
littl
to
do
with
it
they
give
their
gener
manag
one
order
when
it
come
to
the
draftfind
me
the
best
player
so
that
our
team
will
win
the
stanley
cup
whether
that
player
is
in
kindersley
saskatchewan
or
chelyabinsk
russia
if
the
gm
believ
him
to
be
the
better
player
the
gm
should
be
draft
him
where
do
you
get
off
call
the
nhl
their
leagu
when
refer
to
canadian
player
it
doesnt
belong
to
them
it
belong
to
the
owner
the
owner
can
do
what
they
want
while
a
canadian
content
rule
might
be
enforc
here
in
canada
there
is
enough
doubt
that
it
would
be
enforc
in
the
u
that
the
cfl
sorri
for
the
footbal
refer
didnt
even
tri
to
push
their
import
ratio
rule
on
the
sacromento
goldmin
increas
the
competit
for
the
elit
posit
in
most
case
would
make
player
better
anyway
oh
yeah
and
how
mani
european
play
at
the
lower
level
of
profession
hockey
in
north
america
while
there
are
some
that
play
in
the
ahl
or
the
ihl
where
that
an
nhl
team
primari
farm
club
you
dont
hear
of
mani
european
play
in
the
chl
the
echl
or
on
the
secondari
farm
team
in
the
ihl
ie
the
jet
do
have
a
few
russian
player
in
moncton
but
i
dont
believ

with
all
those
team
there
are
plenti
of
posit
for
hockey
player
in
north
america
with
the
number
of
