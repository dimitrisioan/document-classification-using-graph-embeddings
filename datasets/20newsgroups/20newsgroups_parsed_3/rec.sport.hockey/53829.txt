and
one
on
the

away
with
murderw
wa
rob
no
patrick
roy
is
the
reason
the
game
wa
lost
and
ron
hextal
is
the
reason
quebec
won
everybodi
said
it
would
come
down
to
goaltend
that
goaltend
wa
the
key
etc
etc
well
the
key
doesnt
quit
fit
if
your
montreal
i
dont
buy
thi
at
all
roy
wa
the
reason
the
game
wa
tie
and
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
dionn
kept
hi
cool
hextal
gave
up
veri
question
goal
himself
both
dionn
and
bellow
shot
were
misplay
by
hextal
but
just
becaus
hi
gaff
were
earli
in
the
game
no
one
seem
to
care
roy
stood
on
hi
head
for
the
first
minut
of
the
game
when
the
nord
were
rush
from
endtoend
kamenski
minibreak
after
the
tie
goal
and
the
first
shot
by
young
in
ot
were
both
excel
chanc
stop
by
roy
roy
outplay
hextal
for
most
of
the
game
but
roy
becom
the
villain
and
hextal
the
hero
becaus
roy
team
didnt
make
full
use
of
their
opportun
hextal
on
the
other
hand
had
a
lot
of
lucki
bounc
he
play
veri
well
but
the
haller
shot
off
the
post
in
ot
the
rebound
bounc
over
bellow
stick
the
brunet
breakaway
the
chanc
for
leclair
all
those
opportun
were
not
finish
off
by
montreal
and
it
cost
them
hextal
wasnt
particularli
brilliant
on
those
play
blame
stewart
is
just
an
excus
to
avoid
face
the
fact
that
roy
allow
what
wa
one
of
the
worst
goal
he
could
possibl
allow
he
even
saw
the
whole
shot
dammit
sure
no
excus
but
it
wa
just
the
goal
the
time
stank
but
against
an
explos
team
like
quebec
they
gave
them
opportun
too
mani
with
a
powerplay
that
wa
total
unnecessari
montreal
play
a
solid
game
although
they
still
dont
know
how
to
clear
traffic
in
front
of
the
net
the
loss
of
schneider
will
hurt
even
more
i
disagre
roy
play
well
becaus
he
wasnt
screen
the
whole
night
the
defens
for
the
st
time
thi
season
play
remark
keep
sakic
nolan
and
sundin
out
of
the
slot
most
of
the
night
normal
i
would
say
that
ani
team
that
blow
a
goal
lead
with
le
than
five
let
alon
two
minut
to
go
in
regul
time
in
a
playoff
game
especi
need
to
be
smack
upsid
their
collect
head
but
i
dont
think
thi
wa
a
team
loss
although
kean
should
have
been
abl
to
clear
the
zone
just
prior
to
the
first
quebec
goal
thi
most
certainli
wa
a
team
loss
leclair
miss
hi
opportun
a
did
bellow
and
brunet
dionn
took
a
bad
penalti
damphouss
and
lebeau
were
silent
carbonneau
and
savard
were
a
step
behind
all
night
roy
gave
up
the
bad
goal
roy
by
no
mean
can
be
singl
out
for
thi
loss
roy
is
paid
big
money
to
play
he
look
like
a
player
in
an
industri
leagu
on
sakic
shot
and
hextal
didnt
on
dionn
goal
pleas
roy
is
paid
big
money
becaus
that
is
hi
valu
compar
to
other
goali
and
he
still
is
in
the
top
when
you
consid
the
defens
or
lack
of
one
that
play
in
front
of
him
for
most
of
the
season
demer
should
start
racicot
in
the
next
game
if
not
that
he
should
let
the
damn
team
read
the
paper
for
the
next
day
or
twoand
mayb
thi
articl
if
possibl
the
montreal
medium
is
the
quickest
to
heap
prais
and
then
hurl
derogatori
comment
against
the
hab
they
are
no
better
than
uninform
fan
whi
should
they
read
the
paper
they
play
minut
of
burnsian
hockey
to
shut
down
quebec
all
they
need
tonight
and
for
the
rest
of
the
seri
is
the
extra
red
light
to
face
quebecrubbish
that
a
guarante
way
to
end
the
seri
who
would
be
taught
a
lesson
by
thi
the
fan
the
medium
and
racicot
perhap
certainli
not
the
rest
of
the
team
i
didnt
think
the
wraparound
wa
a
bad
a
the
second
goal
i
also
didnt
think
scott
young
should
have
gotten
around
the
defend
cant
rememb
who
in
the
first
place
but
you
are
correct
it
shouldnt
have
gone
in
regardless
if
you
mean
the
goal
should
never
have
gone
in
becaus
there
should
never
have
been
an
ot
then
i
agre
but
the
goal
itself
wa
a
great
piec
of
work
by
young
roy
had
both
the
near
and
far
post
cover
but
young
flip
the
puck
up
under
roy
arm
a
he
wrappedaround
the
net

a
bad
