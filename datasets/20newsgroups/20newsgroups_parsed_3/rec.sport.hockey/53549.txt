roger
what
exactli
is
playoff
hockey
all
about
or
is
it
a

it

but
tough
whaler

should
have
clu
you
in

the
fact
that
my
leaf
woof
wa
tongueincheek
if
playoff
hockey
is
ani
more
intens
than
the
regular
season
varieti
then
it
is
becaus
the
team
are
face
each
other
at
least
consecut
time
in
day
and
hockey
be
the
contact
sport
that
it
is
some
thing
will
be
carri
over
that
might
dissip
dure
the
regular
season
but
that
is
onli
for
some
of
the
player
mani
of
the
rest
who
have
been
play
with
injuri
who
miss
their
famili
or
who
like
grant
fuhr
would
realli
rather
be
play
golf
dont
realli
give
a
damn
of
cours
i
cant
say
thi
for
sure
but
i
believ
that
thi
is
fairli
typic
of
human
natur
and
i
dont
think
that
hockey
player
are
abov
have
what
i
consid
typic
human
attitud
with
the
recent
salari
escal
the
key
player
are
actual
lose
money
by
particip
in
the
playoff
the
one
who
regard
the
playoff
take
a
some
kind
of
a
bonanza
are
fring
player
who
are
unlik
to
consist
be
a
forc
in
the
playoff
now
i
know
some
of
you
are
go
to
come
back
with
win
spirit
and
all
of
that
crap
but
these
player
are
profession
after
all
while
they
may
love
to
play
the
game
that
love
is
entir
incident
to
their
purpos
which
is
to
make
a
decent
live
of
cours
the
coach
is
a
profession
a
well
and
part
of
what
he
is
be
paid
to
do
is
motiv
the
player
so
if
the
coach
doe
hi
job
well
enough
the
player
may
respond
with
a
win
effort
the
second
season
is
after
all
mere
an
exhibit
the
true
champion
of
the
leagu
are
the
divis
winner
the
team
that
come
out
on
top
after
the
long
struggl
of
the
season
the
stanley

playoff
mere
accord
victori
to
the
team
that
ha
remain
healthi
and
hot
the
emphasi
on
the
playoff
with
their
sudden
death
appeal
ha
been
promot
by
the
medium
and
the
owner
with
profit
pure
in
mind
even
if
pittsburgh
lose
the
playoff
we
all
know
that
they
were

the
