in
articl
write
i
for
one
am
happi
about
the
ranger
hire
of
keenan
it
too
bad
that
they
i
agre
that
keenan
is
an
excel
choic
did
you
see
mike
lupica
column
in
sunday
news
my
sentiment
exactli
i
think
he
just
may
be
the
one
to
instil
some
hunger
and
fire
into
their
heart
next
season
either
that
or
he
go
to
be
kick
alot
of
butt
read
through
most
of
these
hockey
news
i
dont
see
mani
ranger
fan
write
im
here
but
am
new
to
thi
group
and
have
been
keep
fairli
quiet
you
know
do
the
lurk
thing
i
dont
have
a
sens
how
mani
ranger
fan
there
are
on
the
list
either
i
am
a
diehard
ranger
fan
i
guess
i
have
to
be
i
sat
in
the
garden
throughout
the
penguin
led
by
mario
goal
decim
of
them
on
but
am
sick
at
the
abund
of
talent
that
ha
been
total
untap
and
the
lack
of
heart
display
thi
season
i
have
some
final
question
about
the
way
the
team
wa
handl
in
that
last
dread
stretch
know
they
need
offens
help
from
the
bluelin
whi
didnt
we
see
mike
hurlbut
who
play
pretti
well
when
he
wa
call
up
when
leetch
first
went
down
hurlbut
wa
injur
for
quit
a
while
im
not
sure
but
i
think
he
may
have
recov
in
time
for
the
playoff
run
and
if
so
like
you
question
whi
he
wasnt
use
whi
is
joe
kocur
play
everi
night
he
is
not
bob
probert
who
is
tough
but
also
can
play
i
believ
kocur
wa
use
in
mani
instanc
for
hi
intimid
factor
grant
he
seem
to
get
an
aw
lot
of
ice
time
for
that
reason
alon
but
you
have
to
realiz
that
when
a
team
is
not
do
ani
real
physic
intimid
id
like
to
have
a
nickel
for
everi
time
jd
said
theyv
got
to
take
the
bodi
more
youv
got
to
at
least
have
some
illus
how
come
paul
broten
is
releg
to
street
cloth
for
the
end
of
the
season
at
least
he
play
with
some
heart
and
charact
draw
penalti
and
play
when
he
on
the
ice
wa
he
in
the
doghous
for
some
reason
i
agre
and
i
dont
know
joe
cirella
enough
said
sorri
i
dont
agre
with
you
here
i
think
joey
c
did
a
good
job
fill
in
when
he
wa
ask
to
i
cant
imagin
that
it
easi
go
from
near
ice
time
to
be
a
full
timer
i
dont
seem
to
rememb
him
turn
the
puck
over
at
the
blue
line
too
much
or
fail
to
clear
the
zone
he
work
hard
and
at
least
didnt
make
ani
rooki
mistak
a
he
said
himself
in
an
interview
he
can
onli
give
what
he
ha
and
he
did
ranger
fan
may
be
suffer
but
were
some
of
the
most
loyal
unlik
island
fan
who
onli
show
up
when
the
team
win
absolut
i
think
attend
at
the
garden
wa
better
on
the
last
day
of
the
season
than
ani
averag
night
for
the
island
fought
