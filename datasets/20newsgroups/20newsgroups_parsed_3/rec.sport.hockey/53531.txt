confer
adam
divis
semifin
boston
v
buffalo
the
bruin
are
play
some
excel
hockey
and
with
cam
neeli
back
and
moog
hi
old
self
again
thi
should
be
a
cakewalk
bruin
in
im
hope
for
a
fuhr
miracl
but
i
agre
that
boston
will
like
win
the
seri
goaltend
is
about
equal
top
offens
player
are
about
equal
mogilnylafontain
v
oatesjuneau
but
buffalo
ha
no
answer
to
neeli
not
to
impli
that
neeli
is
not
a
top
offens
player
btw
in
fact
he
one
of
my
favourit
even
though
he
a
damn
bruin
and
the
rest
of
the
matchup
wrt
lineup
favour
boston
anyway
but
i
think
it
will
go
six
quebec
v
montreal
thi
one
is
veri
tough
to
call
montreal
certainli
ha
the
experi
factor
but
quebec
is
more
talent
imho
itll
come
down
to
the
goali
ill
go
with
experi
and
roy
canadien
in
agre
herebut
montreal
will
be
push
to
the
limit
is
it
just
me
or
doe
everyth
montreal
doe
in
the
playoff
come
down
to
roy
go
hab
final
boston
v
montreal
will
bruin
domin
continu
in
thi
rivalri
ye
moog
ha
consist
outperform
roy
in
the
playoff
after
other
stuff
bruin
in
five
i
cant
predict
a
montreal
victori
becaus
ive
been
watch
them
play
for
week
and
imo
they
severli
need
some
tougher
player
especi
to
play
in
the
garden
last
time
they
beat
the
b
but
boston
had
a
clear
territori
advantag
the
victori
wa
roy
at
the
same
time
i
cant
bring
myself
to
predict
the
possibl
of
a
loss
so
ill
just
say
i
will
not
be
put
money
on
thi
seri
patrick
divis
semifin
pittsburgh
v
ny
island
what
can
i
say
the
pen
are
fli
high
and
have
the
most
talent
in
the
leagu
agre
ny
doesnt
have
the
goaltend
to
stop
the
onslaught
independ
of
the
troubl
they
have
given
pittsburgh
thi
year
pen
in
five
which
is
credit
to
ny
washington
v
new
jersey
capit
in
agre
here
too
but
i
think
it
will
go
at
least
six
jersey
ha
a
decent
team
and
washington
ha
done
poorli
against
the
divis
thi
year
pittsburgh
v
washington
if
the
cap
had
bill
ranford
i
might
see
an
upset
but
don
beaupr
just
doesnt
inspir
my
hope
penguin
in
i
think
they
will
use
tabaracci
more
after
beaupr
get
shell
i
dont
think
it
will
go
six
eithermayb
five
confer
final
pittsburgh
v
boston
a
replay
of
last
year
the
penguin
are
just
a
good
a
month
ago
and
the
bruin
are
much
improv
but
penguin
in
if
pittsburgh
play
boston
imo
they
win
in
like
five
possibl
six
they
own
the
bruin
if
they
play
montreal
i
think
it
will
go
to
seven
and
onc
again
i
wont
be
put
money
on
the
seventh
game
i
say
seven
becaus
the
hab
have
play
pittsburgh
veri
tough
thi
season
campbel
confer
norri
divis
semifin
chicago
v
st
loui
or
minnesota
blackhawk
in
chicago
will
win
but
i
think
in
at
least
six
chicago
is
not
that
good
imo
and
rememb
that
they
take
ridicul
number
of
penalti
detroit
v
toronto
the
leaf
have
had
an
excel
season
but
theyv
been
play
playoff
hockey
all
year
the
hab
under
burn
were
the
same
way
and
alway
wilt
in
the
playoff
red
wing
in
veri
true
the
leaf
have
much
to
be
proud
of
but
they
will
soon
find
out
whi
montreal
did
so
lousi
in
the
playoff
toronto
might
win
two
or
three
at
mlg
though
wing
in
six
mayb
even
seven
final
chicago
v
detroit
thi
will
be
a
war
fedorov
will
win
it
in
ot
red
wing
in
it
will
be
a
warposs
the
most
intens
playoff
seri
of
them
all
and
ye
i
think
detroit
will
win
probert
will
have
to
come
up
big
though
smyth
divis
semifin
vancouv
v
winnipeg
canuck
in
our
first
disagr
canuck
are
play
like
shit
they
dont
use
their
size
at
all
which
may
explain
whi
they
get
hammer
by
a
team
chase
them
calgarywinnipeg
in
six
calgari
v
lo
angel
thi
would
have
been
tough
to
call
except
for
three
thing
the
king
dont
have
a
goali
gari
robert
will
be
back
the
king
shot
themselv
in
the
foot
by
trade
a
proven
winner
paul
coffey
for
a
proven
loser
jimmi
carson
gretzki
is
just
too
weari
to
carri
thi
group
flame
in
thi
is
also
tough
for
me
to
call
becaus
i
havent
seen
the
smyth
enough
i
dont
think
robert
will
be
well
enough
to
figur
in
coffey
is
a
nonissu
who
care
what
carson
ha
done
befor
and
never
underestim
gretzki
la
in
six
final
vancouv
v
calgari
flame
in
if
it
is
these
two
calgari
will
not
need
six
game
but
i
think
it
will
be
lawinnipeg
anyway
and
la
in
seven
becaus
of
home
ice
cofer
final
detroit
v
calgari
red
wing
in
wow
mustv
been
tough
to
go
against
your
team
but
let
see
i
pick
ladetroit
detroit
will
win
probabl
in
six
stanley
cup
final
pittsburgh
v
detroit
three
in
a
row
and
offici
dynasti
statu
for
the
pen
or
can
the
wing
complet
a
dream
season
well
the
wing
are
better
in
goal
not
suffici
so
though
imho
and
have
better
dmen
howev
mario
and
the
boy
can
sure
score
look
for
jagr
to
shine
in
the
playoff
though
i
sure
would
love
to
see
probert
beat
some
sens
into
him
the
pen
are
just
too
much
especi
sinc
detroit
will
have
a
tougher
battl
to
get
here
penguin
in
if
pittsburgh
play
detroit
it
will
go
longer
than
five
and
i
wouldnt
bet
against
the
wing
they
are
veri
strong
imo
and
nobodi
know
how
strong
becaus
theyv
been
underachiev
most
of
the
year
if
forc
to
choos
though
id
have
to
take
the
penguin
a
side
note
vlad
last
week
you
said
that
selann
wa
a
better
player
than
gilmour
no
way
he
is
a
more
talent
pure
goal
scorerbut
asid
from
the
age
differ
there
is
no
way
i
would
take
him
over
gilmour
on
my
team
im
not
ask
for
flame
either
btwive
spent
more
than
enough
time
argu
on
behalf
of
selann
and
i
still
say
he
a
great
player
but
while
he
and
gilmour
are
both
danger
offens
give
teemu
an
edg
gilmour
doe
it
all
i
know
a
lot
of
gilmourbash
go
on
esp
from
flame
fan
but
imo
you
guy
are
let
your
dislik
of
gilmour
cloud
your
judgement
when
it
come
to
hi
skill
he
is
easili
one
of
the
best
allround
player
in
the
nhl
