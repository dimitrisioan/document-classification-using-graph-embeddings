or

if

you
are
out
for
the

ive
never
seen
a
game
where
one
player
ha
commit
penalti
someth
like
thi
would
requir
more
attent
by
the
refere
unsportsmanlik
contact
an
intent
foul
thi
inlclud
all
the
current
flavour
of
rough
fight
and
board
if
you
get
two
you
are
thrown
out
of
the
game
and
fine

besid
the

technic
if

the

until
the
end
of
the
period
the
victim
get
two
shot
if
hesh
wa
in
the
act
of
shoot
when
the
foul
ocur
thi
work
well
for
sever
reason
first
penalti
shot
are
the
most
excit
thing
in
hockey
right
so
it
follow
that
the
more
the
better
next
when
the
player
is
set
up
for
a
penalti
shot
the
network
can
take
a
commerci
final
with
onli
three
penalti
the
network
announc
don
meredith
dick
vital
john
madden
pat
summeral
and
marv
levi
among
other
will
be
abl
to
tell
the
viewer
what
happen
befor
the
pa
announc
say
it
but
your
creat
a
score
opportun
where
there
might
not
have
been
one
befor
i
can
see
the
relationship
between
free
throw
award
after
a
certain
number
of
foul
but
it
obvious
easier
to
score
in
basketbal
there
are
more
opportun
if
a
basketbal
team
score
point
that
at
least
fifti
chanc
made
the
averag
number
of
shot
taken
by
each
team
in
a
hockey
game
and
thi
is
a
total
guess
is
probabl
around
and
a
team
is
lucki
to
capit
on
mayb
of
them
you
have
some
good
idea
concern
the
other
penalti
but
i
think
that
a
player
should
be
award
a
penalti
shot
onli
when
they
had
a
chanc
to
score
and
wa
interf
with
also
later
in
the
post
you
talk
about
how
bore
the
nba
game
you
attend
wa
that
play
wa
stop
too
often
wouldnt
your
penalti
shot
rule
take
up
more
time
dure
a
hockey
game
