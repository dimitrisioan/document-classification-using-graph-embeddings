took
into
account
messer
patrick
norri
smyth
and
the
princ
who
had
alot
more
to
do
with
the
origin
of
the
leagu
than
peopl
who
came
into
an
alreadi
establish
situat
it
is
much
easier
to
be
an
element
of
chang
hardli
the
establish
situat
exist
prior
to
smyth
et
al
the
stanley
cup
wa
a
challeng
trophi
up
for
grab
to
whatev

what
our
dear

they
creat
a
close
leagu
an
oligop
olist
profession
system
in
the
interest
of
make
money
wheth
er
or
not
that
system
ha
contribut
to
better
hockey
is
certainli
debat
we
are
howev
stuck
with
their
invent
and
that
de
bate
is
academ
the
point
to
be
made
howev
is
that
peopl
play
hockey
and
peopl
enjoy
watch
hockey
long
befor
smyth
and
hi
pal
show
up
or
a
standout
in
an
exist
situat
than
it
is
to
be
someon
who
creat
a
new
situat
if
you
want
to
honor
player
like
bobbi
orr
than
im
sure
you
can
find
a
reason
to
name
a
torphi
after
him
such
a
best
offens
defenseman
what
wrong
with
best
defenceman
period
wa
there
ever
a
better
defenceman
wa
there
ever
a
better
player
and
if
you
think
that
bruce
norri
contribut
wa
somehow
more
signific
than
bobbi
orr
then
in
the
interest
of
educ
whi
dont
you
take
a
poll
and
find
out
how
mani
peopl
know
who
norri
wa
but
you
dont
have
to
do
you
no
i
cant
for
the
reason
i
gave
abov
im
in
the
same
boat
a
jason
and
i
grew
up
with
the
current
divison
name
and
learn
them
when
i
wa
about
year
old
and
who
play
in
what
divis
if
a
year
old
american
can
learn
thi
whi
would
it
be
hard
for
an
occasion
fan
to
pick
up
on
who
play
in
what
divis
so
you
dont
feel
that
you
should
have
to
make
the
effort
to
rememb
that
vancouv
play
in
the
west
divis
or
pacif
or
