robert
andolina
write
the
thing
that
confus
me
most
about
espn
is
that
they
decid
to
show
the
penguin
and
devil
again
on
thursday
night
be
that
both
of
the
first
two
game
were
domin
by
pitt
you
would
think
that
they
would
show
a
differ
game
thi
is
in
addit
to
the
fact
that
they
should
show
other
game
just
for
the
sake
of
fair
exposur
espn
must
have
some
veri
poor
market
peopl
they
are
onli
concern
with
featur
player
ie
mario
than
featur
good
competit
hockey
also
some
of
you
should
know
that
a
far
a
i
can
tell
espn
is
not
go
to
show
campbel
confer
game
regularli
in
the
first
two
round
i
believ
that
they
are
onli
go
to
show
campbel
game
in
the
first
two
round
a
those
seri
wear
on
game
or
perhap
game
ive
heard
that
thi
is
becaus
most
of
their
market
is
east
coast
and
henc
would
prefer
the
wale
stuff
also
dont
expect
canadian
team
on
espn
in
summari
if
you
want
to
see
a
network
that
provid
good
hockey
coverag
watch
cbc
from
canada
they
may
be
bias
toward
canadian
team
but
they
dont
treat
the
viewer
like
idiot
they
provid
nice
updat
and
don
cherri
will
alway
provid
a
few
laugh
