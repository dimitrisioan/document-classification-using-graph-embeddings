i
dont
think
trade
kisio
wa
intrins
a
mistak
howev
trade
him
for
a
rd
round
pick
would
be
he
should
have
been
worth
a
lot
more
than
a
rd
round
pick
for
a
playoff
team
in
fact
i
would
intim
that
the
offer
the
shark
got
thi
year
for
kisio
were
way
greater
than
just
a
rd
round
pick
hindsight
nobodi
expect
kisio
to
have
hi
nd
best
career
year
besid
without
kisio
the
shark
would
have
tank
even
earlier
in
the
season
and
gund
might
have
gotten
a
littl
more
seriou
about
get
joe
murphi
a
guy
who
definit
would
be
around
year
from
now
when
the
shark
do
make
the
playoff
what
els
could
be
done
the
gund
offer
million
for
murphi
but
the
oiler
want
prospect
which
the
shark
declin
to
give
which
i
think
is
correct
i
didnt
mean
to
impli
that
gund
offer
wasnt
enough
gund
offer
wa
the
right
but
too
late
in
the
season
m
offer
in
novemb
let
sather
buy
a
replac
for
murphi
thi
season
and
make
the
playoff
thi
year
m
in
march
doesnt
help
sather
with
hi
immedi
object
doesnt
help
with
long
term
object
onli
a
prospect
or
draft
pick
doe
and
no
way
should
the
shark
do
that
howev
get
back
to
whatif
game
had
kisio
been
trade
to
chicago
last
year
then
the
shark
go
for
octob
and
mayb
gund
panick
sooner
in
novemb
and
here
anoth
whatif
twist
chicago
would
have
had
kisio
thi
season
they
never
go
after
murphi
in
the
first
place
becaus
kelli
is
have
hi
best
season
bigger
guy
in
chicago
so
gund
ha
no
competit
so
ferriera
sather
and
keenan
all
look
like
geniu
a
broken
fax
machin
and
ferriera
keenan
and
mayb
kingston
and
mayb
even
green
lose
their
job
kind
of
make
you
shiver
doesnt
