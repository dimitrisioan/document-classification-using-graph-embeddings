write
i
for
one
am
happi
about
the
ranger
hire
of
keenan
it
too
bad
that
they
didnt
hire
him
when
smith
fire
nielsen
mayb
he
could
of
staighten
out
the
babi
on
thi
team
and
made
the
playoff
what
thi
team
need
is
a
littl
fire
under
their
butt
read
through
most
of
these
hockey
news
i
dont
see
mani
ranger
fan
write
im
new
to
thi
system
and
a
big
hockey
fan
and
a
long
suffer
ranger
fan
but
rememb
suffer
build
charact
i
have
some
final
question
about
the
way
the
team
wa
handl
in
that
last
dread
stretch
know
they
need
offens
help
from
the
bluelin
whi
didnt
we
see
mike
hurlbut
who
play
pretti
well
when
he
wa
call
up
when
leetch
first
went
down
whi
is
joe
kocur
play
everi
night
he
is
not
bob
probert
who
is
tough
but
also
can
play
how
come
paul
broten
is
releg
to
street
cloth
for
the
end
of
the
season
at
least
he
play
with
some
heart
and
charact
draw
penalti
and
play
when
he
on
the
ice
wa
he
in
the
doghous
for
some
reason
joe
cirella
enough
said
ranger
fan
may
be
suffer
but
were
some
of
the
most
loyal
unlik
island
fan
who
onli
show
up
when
the
team
win
a
far
a
the
stanley
cup
goe
i
think
there
onli
one
team
that
can
test
pittsburgh
and
that
detroit
thi
would
be
the
most
entertain
and
hard
fought
seri
mario
is
amaz
kurt
i
think
joe
kocu
should
play
everi
night
he
is
a
big
physic
guy
and
he
get
the
fan
into
the
game
with
some
big
hit
both
check
and
fist
it
a
big
advantag
to
get
the
crowd
go
plu
he
help
protect
the
other
player
notic
there
are
veri
few
fight
when
kocur
is
on
the
ice
unless
he
is
it
i
have
seen
peopl
start
to
go
after
essa
tikkanen
onli
to
go
slink
away
when
kocur
step
in
i
think
he
is
big
asset
but
should
be
third
line
and
special
situat
onli
play
thi
is
fast
becom
a
game
without
the
goon
i
admit
kocur
may
get
the
fan
into
the
game
but
sure
they
would
rather
see
broten
take
a
pas
from
kovalev
and
score
a
breakaway
goal
to
put
the
ranger
up
magic
goal
in
the
third
period
rather
than
see
kocur
take
anoth
stupid
penalti
and
the
ranger
give
up
anoth
powerplay
goal
the
ranger
need
anoth
top
flight
center
who
can
take
the
pressur
off
messier
and
the
first
line
nemchinov
is
a
perfect
third
line
center
so
who
goe
beezer
or
richter
kurt
