shark
review
part
goaltend
a
the
shark
season
came
to
a
close
tonight
i
will
start
a
seri
of
post
tri
to
revisit
the
player
the
trade
the
move
etc
that
went
through
for
the
shark
for
the
past
season
if
you
are
uninterest
sinc
i
will
have
the
word
shark
review
in
the
subject
head
in
these
post
you
can
kill
them
i
will
first
tri
to
evalu
how
the
player
did
these
rate
of
cours
are
subject
to
my
own
bias
but
i
hope
that
i
can
tri
to
be
a
object
a
possibl
i
will
evalut
player
who
finish
the
season
with
the
shark
andor
did
not
play
for
anoth
nhl
team
thi
season
thu
then
let
go
to
the
goaltend
brian
hayward
season
th
acquir
from
minnesota
in
dispers
draft
grade
p
d
it
is
sad
that
hi
career
ha
to
come
to
thi
dim
an
end
a
career
that
featur
share
three
jen
trophi
with
patrick
roy
in
and
it
would
inde
be
unfair
for
me
to
do
anyth
but
give
him
a
pas
grade
and
skip
the
letter
grade
but
he
had
simpli
been
aw
on
ice
thi
year
save
for
a
bright
spot
or
two
and
even
if
he
had
been
healthi
he
would
not
be
ani
more
than
the
rdstring
goali
but
hayward
wa
a
classi
individu
who
also
figur
in
on
the
shark
first
ever
victori
the
rd
game
of
the
season
last
year
against
the
calgari
flame
a

rememb
what
a
good
guy
he
wa

percentag
and
a
gaa
watch
hi
statu
go
from
the

goali
to

decor
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
wa
expect
earli
to
carri
the
team
along
instead
he
appar
becam
frustrat
but
the
an
earli
injuri
that
forc
him
to
miss
game
may
have
been
a
contribut
factor
but
upon
return
he
simpli
wasnt
up
to
the

pretti
hard
to
evalu

in
the
one
start
that

prompt
the
blade
owner
ron
parker
to
comment
that
he
should
be
a
candid
for
the
ihl
mvp
honor
the
upcom
ihl
playoff
would
be
a
major
challeng
for
him
a
he

to
make

a
capabl
backup

pick
up
allstar
honor
along
with
irb
now
it
time
for
him
to
show
that
he

share
the
job
with

becaus
with
