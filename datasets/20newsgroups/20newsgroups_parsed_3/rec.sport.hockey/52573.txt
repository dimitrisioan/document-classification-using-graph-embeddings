time
ive
been
play
with
piec
of
lumbar
that
seem
to
weigh
alot
and
break
after
a
few
us
so
im
think
of
chang
to
an
aluminum
shaft
so
when
i
break
the
blade
all
i
have
to
do
is
chang
it
the
problem
is
that
there
is
such
a
wide
reang
of
model
and
select
out
there
that
im
not
certain
which
to
consid
can
ani
of
you
post
some
of
your
suggest
and
experi
with
the
aluminum
stick
what
is
the
differ
between

about
them
and
which
brand
