minnesota
scene
to
those
who
are
wonder
what
is
happen
in
minnesota
from
what
i
have
seen
in
the
local
news
tv
and
newspap
variou
peopl
in
the
area
are
tri
to
get
a
new
hockey
team
a
columnist
for
the
st
paul
pioneer
press
wrote
an
articl
give
the
insid
scoop
on
the
issu
there
are
three
local
site
compet
for
a
team
and
three
possibl
candiat
to
move
to
the
twin
citi
first
the
site
target
center
civic
center
st
paul
and
ye
even
the
met
center
the
columnist
wa
pretti
confid
that
minnesota
will
get
a
team
and
that
the
target
center
will
ultim
win
out
he
argu
howev
that
the
competit
from
the
other
two
site
will
delay
the
process
consider
without
the
intersit
competit
the
columnist
sorri
i
cant
rememb
hi
name
believ
that
minnesota
would
have
a
team
by
the
season
also
becaus
of
the
situat
with
the
timberwolv
thing
will
be
delay
until
unless
the
citi
of
minneapoli
take
over
the
target
center
howev
they
are
unlik
to
do
so
until
the
met
center
is
destroy
becaus
the
citi
will
lose
money
if
there
is
competit
from
the
met
for
convent
and
shortterm
event
even
with
hockey
at
target
to
add
to
thi
mess
a
studi
to
month
is
go
to
be
conduct
on
the
futur
viabil
of
the
met
center
which
obvious
delay
the
process
even
further
i
hope
that
the
studi
is
cancel
which
will
have
the
effect
of
knock
the
met
center
out
of
the
run
and
perhap
encourag
minneapoli
to
take
over
the
target
center
sooner
the
citi
would
be
be
even
more
encourg
if
the
wreck
ball
is
taken
to
the
met
which
may
happen
regard
possibl
candid
the
three
team
are
hartford
tampa
bay
and
new
jersey
i
would
prefer
the
devil
minnesota
ice
demon
although
the
lightn
may
have
potenti
although
it
hasnt
been
announc
yet
it
look
like
neutral
site
game
will
be
play
at
the
target
center
next
year
appar
the
devil
are
interest
in
play
in
a
mani
of
those
six
game
a
possibl
and
i
wouldnt
be
surpris
to
see
hartford
and
tampa
show
up
there
either
so
minnesota
may
end
up
get
anoth
team
but
it
may
take
a
few
year
go
