toni
bravo
toni
i
too
am
sick
of
all
the
mindless
fanat
blind
faith
jet
fan
who
could
prpbabli
predict
the
end
of
the
world
more
accur
than
the
coutcom
of
a
playoff
seri
now
i
will
admit
that
i
am
a
mindless
fanatica
blind
faith
canuck
fan
but
unlik
those
from
winterpeg
i
do
not
need
to
vent
my
spleen
upon
the
world
a
to
how
great
my
team
is
i
know
i
have
confid
in
them
and
that
enough
grant
the
jet
finish
the
season
hot
and
the
canuck
were
have
troubl
but
vancouv
ha
built
themselv
a
reput
for
be
a
playoff
team
just
ask
ani
flame
fan
they
may
not
win
everi
seri
but
they
alway
fight
to
the
end
ill
admit
that
last
year
wa
not
great
but
if
they
combin
the
work
ethic
of
the
past
with
the
new
tallent
of
the
present
they
will
be
tough
to
beat
note
i
did
not
say
they
would
pummel
everi
team
they
meet
and
destroy
the
greatest
player
play
today
now
like
ani
canuck
fan
i
would
love
to
see
them
take
the
cup
i
feel
they
have
a
good
chanc
to
make
it
out
of
the
smyth
and
a
shot
at
detroit
i
cant
see
them
lose
to
st
loui
if
pittsburgh
make
it
to
the
cup
id
have
to
put
my
money
on
them
ye
even
if
theyr
face
the
canuck
if
buffalo
montreal
or
quebec
beat
pittsburgh
id
choos
the
winner
of
vancuov
and
detroit
to
take
the
cup
