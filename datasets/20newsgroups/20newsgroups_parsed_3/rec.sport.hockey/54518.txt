not

actual
a
truli
held
opinion
in

write
i
would
say
that
the
letter
clearli
impli
represent
of
the
view
of
a
group
that
i
belong
to
and
i
dont
share
those
view
and
i
dont
believ
that
the
major
of
poster
on
rshockey
share
those
view
and
so
i
have
no
intent
of
allow
them
to
simpli
go
ahead
without
make
my
feel
on
the
subject
