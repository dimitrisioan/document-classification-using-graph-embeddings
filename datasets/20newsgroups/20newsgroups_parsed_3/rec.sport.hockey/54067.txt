too
mani
of
the

even
if
the

call
all
penalti
it
would
be
an
improv
unfortun
that
is
the
way
the

head
you
cant
fight
so
the
onli
way
to
retali
against

with
a
cheap
shot
when
the
ref
isnt
look
ulf
ha
brought
thi
to
a
high

are
at
a
disadvantag
in
the
new
system
let
face
it
a
cheap
shot
like
high
stick
is
a
veri
effect
method
it
is
easier
to
hide
from
the
ref
ha
a
better
chanc
of
caus
injuri
and
you
can
draw
peopl
into
fight
that
way
i
dont
like
it
but
that
the
way
the
leagu
is
go
by
the
way
there
wa
a
rather
good
hit
by
ulf
in
the
last
penguindevil
game
manag
to
hit
the
nj
player
in
the
face
with
a
stick
must
have
been
a
legal
hit
after
all
ulf
is
a
clean
player
and
is
allow
to
do
thing
like
that
