inf
write
not
too
low
perhap
but
sure
not
a
high
a
that
of
an
european
nhl
divis
the
finnish
team
for
exampl
would
contain
all
player
current
on
the
nation
team
plu
a
topclass
foreign
or
two
they
would
be
in
an
entir
differ
leagu
than
tp
or
jokerit
both
of
whom
have
perhap
a
dozen
player
of
intern
class
if
even
that
whi
settl
for
a
minor
leagu
when
you
could
have
the
best
it
is
no
matter
what
you
call
the
team
jokerit
and
tp
or
helsinki
tornado
and
turku
typhoon
the
best
palyer
in
finland
would
eventu
end
up
in
those
team
anyway
if
they
were
in
the
big
leagu
id
rather
spend
mark
to
watch
the
helsinki
tornado
play
montreal
the
ny
ranger
or
lo
angel
than
mark
for
the
privileg
to
see
jokerit
v
jypht
or
even
djurgarden
if
there
noth
like
the
nhl
period
unrealist
for
now
mayb
we
should
first
just
expand
finnish
leagu
to
allow
team
from
baltic
countri
to
entri
then
other
will
get
interest
in
the
idea
that
mayb
one
should
settl
someth
bigger
the
ultim
goal
a
you
want
it
would
be
european
divis
in
nhl
btw
doe
that
make
a
final
with
an
europan
team
against
norht
american
