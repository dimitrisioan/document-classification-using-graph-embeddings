re
nhl
team
in
milwauke
charli
betz
write
after
read
some
of
the
report
of
possibl
nhl
move
to
milwauke
or
that
milwauke
should
have
an
nhl
team
i
thought
id
pas
along
a
stori
i
heard
recent
thi
is
second
hand
so
i
dont
know
how
true
it
is
but
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
either
bradley
center
in
milwauke
is
home
to
the
milwauke
admir
minor
leaug
hockey
team
the
owner
of
the
admir
sorri
i
cant
rememb
hi
name
either
own
or
at
least
shell
out
the
major
of
the
fund
to
build
the
bradley
center
lloyd
pettit
supposedli
he
wa
approach
by
the
nhl
about
an
expans
franchis
but
turn
it
down
becaus
he
thought
the
franchis
fee
of
million
wa
too
high
like
i
said
i
dont
know
whether
thi
stori
is
true
or
just
a
rumor
but
if
it
true
dont
look
for
an
nhl
team
in
milwauke
anytim
soon
the
admir
arent
go
to
be
forc
out
of
the
build
and
you
wont
see
an
nhl
club
and
a
minor
leagu
club
in
the
same
build
especi
sinc
the
nba
milwauke
buck
play
there
a
well
ye
it
is
true
that
he
refus
to
buy
a
franchis
from
the
nhl
for
m
but
at
the
time
the
reason
wa
that
the
establish
market
for
team
wa
much
le
than
that
he
felt
that
no
one
would
pay
m
for
an
expans
team
and
that
he
would
simpli
wait
to
buy
an
exist
franchis
for
le
than
that
but
the
market
fool
him
and
team
have
been
creat
for
m
apiec
in
the
last
three
year
and
even
the
exist
team
cant
be
move
for
le
than
m
and
i
doubt
that
he
could
get
one
for
that
littl
pettit
gambl
and
lost
now
hell
have
to
pay
more
