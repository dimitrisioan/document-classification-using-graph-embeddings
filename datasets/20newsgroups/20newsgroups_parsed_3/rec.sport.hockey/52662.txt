actual
went

a
nba
basketbal
game
last
week
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
wa
amaz
how
bore
it
wa
the

is
so
slow
they
actual
had
fan
come
out
for
thing
like
freethrow
shoot
contest
dure
the
period
of
cours
the
laker
girl
get
to
do
their
routin
at
least
time
dure
the
game
and
not
just
between
period
either
there
is
a
whistl
everi
second
on
averag
mayb
le
the
game
is
minut
with
minut
between
quarter
and
and
a
minut
halftim
and
it
still
take
over
hour
the
reason
for
thi
ha
to
be
tv
there
is
plenti
of
room
to
throw
in
commerci
and
have
the
announc
jabber
while
noth
el
is
happen
on
tv
basketbal
is
fairli
entertain
imho
but
it
is
better
to
watch
it
on
tv
than
to
be
there
if
thi
is
the
road
the
nhl
is
follow
then
it
truli
is
a
sad
day
enough
for
now
