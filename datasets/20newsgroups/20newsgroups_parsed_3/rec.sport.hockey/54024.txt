re
div
and
conf
name
in
articl
roger
maynard
write
there
are
sever
problem
with
the
way
the
game
is
be
present
to
the
fan
i
feel
that
geograph
name
would
enhanc
region
loyalti
more
than
name
honour
personag
i
think
a
compromis
would
work
name
honour
personag
in
confer
name
and
use
geograph
refer
in
the
division
name
although
i
still
do
not
think
the
move
will
draw
fan
to
the
game
imo
it
a
cosmet
chang
that
bettman
and
the
owner
hope
will
have
an
effect
and
it
doesnt
say
much
for
the
mental
of
anybodi
it
work
on
either
anoth
thing
that
bother
me
is
the
point
system
percentag
a
use
in
the
other
major
sport
are
clearli
more
inform
when
i
look
at
the
nhl
stand
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
quick
calcul
to
account
for
game
in
hand
which
is
almost
alway
the
case
some
will
object
to
percentag
claim
perhap
that
it
is
an
american
of
the
sport
surpris
i
agre
total
the
point
system
is
fine
if
everybodi
at
all
time
ha
play
the
same
number
of
game
sinc
thi
is
almost
never
the
case
win
percentag
is
the
way
to
go
i
dont
particularli
care
if
it
is
an
american
thing
either
if
it
work
