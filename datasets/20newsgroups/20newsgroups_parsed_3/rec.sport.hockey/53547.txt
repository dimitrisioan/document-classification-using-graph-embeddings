re
washington
to
beat
pitt
in
articl
frank
micha
salvator
write
what
make
you
think
so
id
like
to
understand
your
reason
from
my
seat
the
cap
dont
realli
appear
to
believ
that
they
can
defeat
pittsburgh
therefor
they
dont
i
think
their
spirit
wa
broken
in
last
year
playoff
and
hasnt
realli
recov
i
dont
know
what
the
season
seri
number
were
but
i
believ
that
the
pen
won
it
i
think
that
either
the
devil
or
the
island
will
caus
more
problem
for
what
is
thi
spirit
crap
im
a
cap
fan
and
hope
they
win
if
they
end
up
face
pittsburgh
but
i
dont
think
the
cap
lose
to
pitt
becaus
of
lack
of
spirit
ye
the
penguin
won
the
season
seri
against
the
cap
theyv
won
eighteen
game
in
a
row
for
god
sake
did
you
ever
think
the
penguin
might
be
good
and
that
whi
they
win
i
reread
what
i
wrote
and
it
didnt
say
exactli
what
i
thought
sure
the
pen
are
a
better
team
theyv
got
size
and
the
best
skill
player
in
the
leagu
theyv
also
got
the
best
clutch
goaltend
theyr
the
best
team
in
the
leagu
but
my
point
wa
the
cap
have
not
play
to
their
abil
level
v
the
pen
sinc
last
year
choke
and
that
the
mental
problem
the
one
theyv
had
for
a
number
of
year
i
tri
to
point
out
spirit
mental
prepared
will
to
win
whatev
you
want
to
call
it
it
miss
when
the
cap
play
the
pen
actual
your
right
it
wont
make
ani
differ
