superstar
and
attend
wa
teemu
selann
wa
leader
in
deepak
chhabra
write
dean
j
falcion
post
from
write
but
i
think
the
reason
is
lemieux
had
a
point
season
and
wa
the
first
nongretzki
to
win
the
hart
and
ross
sinc
peopl
turn
out
to
watch
him
play
i
will
grant
that
a
star
like
mario
will
draw
fan
even
if
the
team
suck
but
thi
is
short
term
onli
i
still
do
not
think
the
attend
increas
will
last
unless
the
team
is
a
winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkick
one
pittsburgh
wa
still
get
better
so
peopl
continu
to
support
them
if
they
suddenli
drop
to
say
point
youd
have
knee
surgeri
for
some
of
the
peopl
jump
off
the
bandwagon
i
disagre
mcnall
ha
demonstr
with
gretzki
that
a
star
bring
out
the
crowd
whether
or
not
the
team
is
expect
to
do
well
veri
few
fan
real
istic
expect
the
king
to
do
well
thi
year
although
i
do
and
yet
they
still
go
out
to
see
gretzki
thi
is
the
market
strategi
sell
the
game
by
sell
the
star
that
is
employ
by
basebal
and
notabl
the
nba
and
thi
is
the
attitud
that
the
new
bettmanmcnal
leadership
is
bring
to
the
leagu
they
have
gone
on
record
a
state
that
they
are
tri
to
sell
the
game
on
it
star
timo
salami
and
brett
hull
are
perfect
exampl
of
player
that
real
fan
know
arent
worth
a
damn
and
yet
be
benificiari
of
marketingori
coach
strategi
have
goal
total
that
would
indic
to
the
casual
observ
the
veri
fan
the
nhl
want
to
attract
that
these
player
are
inde
superstar
they
made
the
transact
to
tri
and
build
a
winner
around
mario
that
is
true
but
the
improv
in
attend
came
befor
they
start
do
thi
coffey
late
in
and
befor
they
even
had
a
playoff
bound
team
a
doubl
of
attend
occur
in
from
the
previou
year
an
increas
from
point
to
point
is
not
go
to
do
that
the
arriv
of
mario
lemieux
is
what
did
it
it
might
help
to
think
about
what
would
go
through
a
fan
mind
who
suddenli
found
an
interest
in
mario
and
the
pen
wa
it
gee
mario
lemieux
is
amaz
ill
go
watch
him
play
or
wa
it
gee
now
weve
got
a
kick
as
guy
on
our
side
ill
go
watch
him
play
i
think
it
wa
the
latter
it
aint
nearli
so
simpl
a
thi
the
casual
fan
doesnt
think
about
much
at
all
can
you
actual
find
an
adult
with
a

believ
that

you
leav
it
out
becaus
you
dont
know
much
about
