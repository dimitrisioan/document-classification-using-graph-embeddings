real
fan
there
wa
a
discuss
about
how
real
fan
were
one
who
respect
their
team
no
matter
ow
bad
they
are
that
bullshit
anyon
who
would
follow
the
pen
or
the
pirat
in
part
of
the
earli
eighti
on
a
devot
basi
are
loser
it
ok
to
follow
and
be
concern
about
your
home
team
but
to
give
them
respect
even
when
it
is
clear
the
manag
and
the
player
suck
should
not
be
requir
of
a
true
fana
true
fan
would
follow
the
team
in
troubl
time
to
the
extent
that
they
could
discu
how
to
improv
the
team
when
i
visit
pittsburgh
ill
refus
to
go
to
a
pirat
game
sinc
i
think
the
manag
ha
given
pittsburgh
a
team
which
could
have
been
much
better
even
if
they
couldnt
sign
barri
bond
lert
say
the
pen
start
do
to
their
own
team
what
the
oiler
have
done
thi
year
and
what
the
whaler
have
done
in
recent
year
i
would
be
hard
press
to
show
much
enthusiasm
for
the
team
ill
still
follow
it
and
bitch
about
it
but
i
wont
wast
my
money
on
mediocr
team
pravin
