atlanta
abc
affili
suck
i
knew
despit
the
lack
of
a
full
game
telecast
last
week
it
wa
still
too
much
hockey
for
atlanta
atlanta
abc
ha
declin
to
pick
up
ani
playoff
game
till
may
and
even
when
they
show
the
game
on
may
and
may
they
will
continu
to
skip
the
first
half
hour
of
the
telecast
i
know
thi
is
still
a
better
situat
compar
to
rest
of
georgia
alabama
etc
but
it
is
still
pretti
annoy
at
least
in
pittsburgh
we
had
a
network
preemptionchannel
which
show
all
netwoork
show
prempt
by
the
local
affili
i
ask
them
what
their
problem
wa
i
told
them
that
a
local
rate
wa
not
that
bad
consid
it
wa
the
first
nhl
game
shown
after
a
long
time
without
much
promot
besid
their
syndic
program
in
the
afternoon
is
usual
low
rate
so
what
did
they
have
to
lose
by
show
nhl
playoff
she
told
me
that
they
had
contractu
oblig
i
ask
her
if
golf
wa
shown
oin
abc
would
contractu
oblig
come
in
the
way
and
how
come
contractu
oblig
didnt
come
in
the
way
of
last
week
telecast
she
then
couldnt
give
me
a
coher
answer
also
i
ad
that
atlanta
had
one
of
the
highest
neutral
site
game
attend
and
that
the
demograph
were
good
i
think
abc
and
other
network
should
begin
to
tie
their
high
rate
program
like
roseann
in
with
thier
sport
program
i
hope
that
everyon
in
atlanta
who
read
thi
bboard
call
wsb
and
complain
bitterlyt
about
thi
tell
them
you
will
stop
watch
their
news
telecast
sinc
they
seem
to
be
veri
unprofession
in
handl
thi
situat
the
ladi
did
not
seem
to
settl
on
a
singl
reason
sometim
the
reason
is
low
rate
then
anoth
time
she
say
contractu
oblig
