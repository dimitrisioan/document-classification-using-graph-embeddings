re
patrick
playoff
look
like
thi
in
articl
jan
brittenson
write
in
articl
georg
pandelio
write
the
pen
wont
be
play
montreal
becaus
boston
will
win
adam
division
play
buffalo
and
quebec
will
make
decent
show
boston
out
of
sheer
determin
will
win
a
game
against
the
pen
but
no
more
they
have
heart
but
the
pen
have
too
mani
big
gun
and
too
mani
way
to
win
if
boston
doe
inde
win
the
adam
noth
is
certain
and
inde
get
to
play
the
pen
then
i
think
youll
find
a
veri
differ
boston
team
thi
year
boston
will
use
everi
trick
in
the
book
to
shut
down
the
pen
offens
someth
they
didnt
even
tri
last
year
the
pen
weak
spot
is
defens
and
goaltend
if
boston
first
i
enjoy
read
your
post
second
i
disagre
with
the
pen
weak
spot
be
defens
and
goaltend
for
a
coupl
of
reason
barrasso
ha
had
a
spectacular
year
no
slow
start
consist
sharp
gaa
and
lead
the
leagu
in
win
tommi
deserv
the
vezina
given
the
lack
of
respect
he
command
though
i
doubt
he
will
win
it
the
other
reason
concern
the
pen
team
defens
they
are
hover
around
rd
or
th
in
the
fewest
goal
allow
that
is
a
big
improv
for
them
and
it
indic
that
they
are
play
better
team
defens
can
shut
down
the
pen
offens
and
get
an
earli
goal
then
you
have
a
real
game
if
the
pen
score
first
then
it
practic
over
i
dont
think
the
pen
have
the
disciplin
to
stick
to
the
team
game
if
theyr
held
scoreless
minut
into
the
second
boston
doesnt
have
the
gun
of
the
pen
but
the
pen
doesnt
have
the
defens
goaltend
and
disciplin
of
boston
still
boston
can
put
the
puck
in
the
net
rememb
that
boston
is
not
a
runandgun
patrickstyl
team
although
they
play
runandgun
hockey
for
the
better
part
of
the
regular
season
who
doesnt
even
neeli
backcheck
all
the
way
in
behind
hi
own
net
if
necessari
penaltykil
will
be
a
big
factor
boston
are
i
believ
over
the
last
someth
shorthand
situat
mean
they
have
score
shg
while
give
up
ppg
one
in
a
lacklust
game
against
ottawa
id
say
the
seri
will
go
to
or
but
im
much
le
certain
whether
it
will
be
in
favor
of
the
pen
or
the
b
their
style
go
into
the
playoff
are
too
differ
to
make
it
predict
still
id
place
my
bet
on
the
pen
i
think
my
predict
is
that
if
the
b
can
get
the
first
goal
in
four
of
the
game
theyll
take
the
seri
otherwis
the
pen
will
but
id
rather
wait
and
see
whether
the
b
will
actual
get
out
of
the
adam
to
begin
with
buffalo
quebec
and
montreal
arent
exactli
plan
to
call
it
a
game
and
go
home
