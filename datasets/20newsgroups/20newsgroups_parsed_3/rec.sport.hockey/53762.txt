greg

write
in
articl
randi
a
graca
write
i
also
think
that
they
will
have
a
hard
time
with
pittsburgh
if
they
face
them
in
the
final
which
is
what
all
the
detroit
sportswrit
are
predict
although
i
think
bryan
murray
is
probabl
the
best
gm
i
have
ever
seen
in
hockey
how
do
you
figur
that
when
bryan
murray
took
over
the
wing
they
were
a
pretti
good
team
that
wa
contend
for
the
stanley
cup
but
look
unlik
to
win
it
now
they
are
a
pretti
good
team
that
is
contend
for
the
stanley
cup
but
look
unlik
to
win
it
a
truli
great
gm
would
have
been
abl
to
make
the
move
to
push
the
team
to
the
upper
echelon
of
the
nhl
and
mayb
win
the
stanley
cup
a
good
gm
like
murray
can
maintain
the
team
success
but
cant
push
them
to
the
next
level
when
jacqu
demer
brought
the
wing
to
the
confer
final
twice
a
few
year
back
he
had
everyon
on
the
team
give
percent
but
he
had
veri
littl
talent
he
had
yzerman
bob
probert
who
had
drink
problem
at
the
time
and
a
coupl
of
decent
goaltend
in
hanlon
and
stefan
who
got
hot
that
about
it
can
you
name
one
player
on
those
earlier
team
who
even
deserv
to
be
in
the
allstar
game
much
le
actual
got
there
other
than
yzerman
and
probert
like
petr
klima
give
me
a
break
when
they
face
edmonton
in
both
of
those
confer
final
a
hard
a
they
play
it
wa
clear
they
face
a
team
that
simpli
had
superior
talent
to
the
wing
that
whi
they
could
not
get
to
the
final
also
at
that
time
the
norri
divis
wa
still
the
weakest
divis
in
hockey
and
get
past
chicago
and
toronto
wa
not
a
impress
a
it
is
today
murray
ha
brought
score
talent
to
the
wing
that
they
did
not
have
a
few
year
ago
when
devellano
wa
gm
and
demer
wa
coach
to
name
a
few
ysebaert
kozlov
and
paul
coffey
who
ha
made
a
definit
posit
impact
on
the
power
play
especi
murray
ha
built
one
of
the
most
talent
team
in
hockey
at
the
present
with
the
possibl
except
of
the
pittsburgh
penguin
the
wing
have
at
least
five
goal
scorer
that
i
can
think
of
and
a
coupl
of
defenseman
with
over
game
worth
of
playoff
experi
murray
one
fail
is
that
unlik
the
other
gm
you
mention
who
are
definit
also
good
dont
get
me
wrong
he
ha
not
found
for
himself
a
strong
coach
to
motiv
the
team
to
go
out
and
give
percent
for
the
full
minut
everi
night
like
they
did
the
last
time
they
made
a
cup
run
when
a
team
win
or
lose
it
a
reflect
of
the
gm
and
the
coach
which
wa
the
point
of
my
origin
post
if
the
team
outmatch
their
oppon
in
term
of
talent
but
lose
anyway
which
ha
been
the
case
thi
year
when
the
wing
have
struggl
that
indic
that
the
gm
ha
done
hi
job
in
build
up
the
team
but
the
coach
ha
fail
to
motiv
them
if
a
in
the
case
of
the
last
run
the
wing
made
in
the
playoff
befor
murray
came
they
gave
oppon
a
hard
time
who
should
have
beaten
them
easili
that
indic
good
coach
make
up
for
a
lack
of
talent
all
of
thi
is
fine
i
never
said
that
murray
wa
a
bad
gm
i
mere
said
that
he
isnt
the
best
gm
in
hockey
or
even
a
contend
for
that
honor
if
murray
is
a
great
a
you
claim
the
wing
would
have
won
the
stanley
cup
by
now
probabl
more
than
onc
if
he
wa
a
great
a
gm
a
you
claim
and
he
wa
a
poor
a
coach
a
you
claim
he
would
have
been
intellig
enough
to
hire
the
coach
to
push
the
team
to
the
next
level
of
success
but
murray
is
an
averag
unspectacular
nhl
coach
and
a
pretti
good
gm
so
none
of
thi
is
true
anyway
