q

that

the

well
i

he
did
but
look
senat
dole
and
a
lot
of
the
other
republican
now
in
the
senat
vote
for
the
same
kind
of
thing
for
ronald
reagan
in
and
our
research
indic
that
a
major
of
them
over
time
vote
for
a
total
of
emerg
spend
measur
total
over
billion
when
reagan
and
bush
were
presid
in
those
administr
and
mani
of
those
purpos
were
not
nearli
a
worthi
a
put
the
american
peopl
back
to
work
i
dont
want
to
go
back
and
revisit
everi
one
but
you
can
do
it
you
can
look
at
the
research
there
so
thi
posit
theyr
take
is
not
credibl
we
have
a
veri
tough
fiveyear
deficit
reduct
plan
all
these
cost
are
cover
dure
that
time
and
then
some
and
the
veri
peopl
that
are
say
thi
ha
all
got
to
be
paid
for
dont
have
much
of
a
histori
on
which
to
base
their
posit
theyv
got
year
of
vote
for
stimulu
measur
of
thi
kind
that
had
veri
littl
to
with
put
the
american
peopl
back

so
i
think
weve
