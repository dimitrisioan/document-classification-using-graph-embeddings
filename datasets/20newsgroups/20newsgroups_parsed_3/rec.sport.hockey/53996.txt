averag
in
hi
first

he
had
a
horribl
start
but
play
great
the
last
ten
game
after
he
wa
bench
hi
gaa
even
with
the
horribl
start
wa
last
year
thi

i
think
he

ha
to
if

yesterday
charl
hubbert
write
great
write
up
of
the
wingstoronto
seri
thu
far
i
agre
with
just
about
everyth
that
you
said
but
chevi
shouldnt
have
let
the
shot
from
the
right
point
in
first
goal
mikorov
i
think
other
than
that
the
wing
are
look
good
and
chevi
is
hold
hi
own
not
great
but
mayb
chevi
ha
let
in
or
soft
goal
so
far
but
they
all
didnt
matter
howev
hi
recent
histori
ha
been
inconsist
play
but
come
up
big
when
it
count
the
score
wa
i
think
when
the
goal
you
mention
wa
score
in
the
third
period
when
it
look
like
toronto
wa
come
back
chevi
wa
except
i
can
see
him
a
a
barraso
style
playoff
goali
inconsist
when
there
noth
on
the
line
but
come
up
big
when
realli
need
i
guess
well
both
find
out
ron
and
one
of
my
major
goal
is
to
leav
the
next
presid

new
set
of
