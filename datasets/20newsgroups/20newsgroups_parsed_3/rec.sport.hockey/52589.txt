sourc
is

the
point
there
are
far
too
mani
european
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watch
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
let
say
the
red
wing
and
the
canuck
and
see

thi
north
america
or

particularli
annoy
but
the
number
of

get
wors
a
well

will
complet
throw
up
a
it

now
everi
time
i
see
the
canuck

i
keep
hope
someon
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carri
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canuck
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
wa
a
littl
carri
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owner
draft
all
these
european
instead
of
canadian
and
some
american
it
deni
young
canadian
the
opportun
to
play
in
their
north
american
leagu
and
instead
give
it
to
european
who
arent
even
better
hockey
player
it
all
hype
thi
european
mystiqu
is
sicken
but
until
nhl
owner
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
player
will
continu
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
draft
into
their
own
leagu
with
the
number
of
euro
in
the
nhl
escal
the
problem
is
clearli
onli
get
wors
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
leagu
