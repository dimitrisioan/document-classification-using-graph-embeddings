write
on
the
other
hand
im
hard
press
to
think
of
ani
other
real
mistak
fereirra
made
imagin
inde
but
then
again
we
have
the
benefit
of
hindsight
well
the
jettison
for
youth
fast
strategi
wa
hi
also
in
hindsight
it
didnt
work
all
that
well
but
i
think
it
wa
more
becaus
it
left
the
shark
on
a
tightrop
without
a
net
not
that
it
wa
inher
flaw
it
wa
the
injuri
that
caus
u
to
fall
let
say
that
in
the
view
of
the
shark
upper
manag
the
attempt
to
trade
kisio
wa
a
major
factor
in
the
decis
to
fire
feirerra
from
all
indic
it
wasnt
the
major
factor
but
the
last
straw
there
were
person
conflict
among
shark
manag
and
disagr
over
how
personnel
were
go
to
be
handl
not
just
who
wa
be
trade
v
kept
but
who
wa
be
sent
to
kc
what
ferriera
did
if
rumor
are
right
wa
not
alway
what
the
folk
behind
the
bench
want
or
need
im
inclin
to
take
exactli
the
opposit
view
they
should
have
kept
himh
obvious
the
luckiest
man
in
hockey
i
think
if
theyd
kept
ferriera
they
would
have
lost
some
of
their
other
manag
staff
depend
on
which
sourc
you
trust
we
might
have
lost
grillo
and
lombardi
and
murdoch
over
the
summer
frankli
i
want
to
keep
those
three
we
may
well
ahv
also
lost
kingston
which
of
cours
is
now
a
moot
point
the
shark
have
been
build
an
organiz
staff
that
is
highli
consensu
and
cooper
ferriera
want
to
run
thing
hi
way
there
were
conflict
ferriera
lost
that
say
noth
about
hi
skill
or
accomplish
at
that
level
a
lot
is
person
and
polit
i
think
he
did
some
good
thing
for
the
shark
but
that
he
never
fit
in
a
a
shark
person
i
hope
he
succe
beyond
hi
wildest
dream
down
in
anaheim
too
becaus
itll
be
good
for
hockey
but
i
want
the
duck
to
be
doormat
for
a
coupl
of
year
so
the
shark
succee
first
