how
long
can
the
leaf
play
shorthand
and
still
be
expect
to
score
they
did
some
fine
penelykil
in
the
first
men
down
for
a
coupl
of
minut
at
one
point
but
they
just
couldnt
keep
it
up
they
spent
virtual
the
entir
game
either
shorthand
or
just
come
off
a
penelti
a
soon
a
theyd
get
regroup
theyr
penal
again
sheesh
like
gilmour
said
after
the
st
you
cant
go
call
everi
littl
push
an
shove
in
a
game
like
that
and
if
your
go
to
you
have
to
do
it
for
both
team
pearson
one
of
my
four
favorit
leaf
play
like
a
bonehead
i
saw
him
person
screw
up
at
least
good
score
opportun
and
then
he
got
that
bonehead
minut
major
highstick
penalti
cullen
ha
gotten
stronger
sinc
hi
return
from
injuri
a
handful
of
game
ago
and
he
play
a
good
game
if
the
other
player
on
hi
line
can
smarten
up
that
line
should
do
okay
clark
got
to
get
tough
he
got
to
intimid
and
go
for
the
net
send
clark
up
the
left
wing
over
the
blue
line
a
coupl
time
hi
patent
wrist
shot
will
put
some
number
on
the
board
and
pearson
heck
mayb
he
should
be
bench
i
hate
to
repeat
grape
but
where
the
heck
wa
foligno
zezel
cant
do
all
the
check
himself
and
get
macllwain
on
the
move
we
need
some
speed
out
there
keep
potvin
in
net
he
did
okay
consid
although
like
i
said
a
coupl
week
ago
potvin
mess
up
in
a
coupl
game
in
the
ahl
playoff
last
year
he
can
easili
do
it
again
my
predict
last
week
wa
toronto
in
that
the
game
det
win
will
be
blowout
and
the
game
tor
win
will
be
close
i
still
stand
by
that
dont
fret
leaf
fan
in
order
to
win
in
the
other
team
ha
to
win
burn
is
go
to
make
some
magic
hell
mix
up
some
line
match
the
wing
lineperlin
hell
have
hi
team
check
hard
and
hell
never
let
them
get
outnumb
in
their
own
end
the
leaf
will
win
wednesday
night
and
will
take
or
their
home
game
probabl
the
first
one
