that
is
valid
if
winnipeg

such
a
lousi
defens
team
then
whi
the
hell
doe
salami
stand
around
the
other

bluelin
when

and
feed

in
ani
meaning
way
to

just
bare
they

allow
more
goal
than
they
have
score
sound
an
aw
lot
like
salami
to
me
sound
like
they
would
be
just
a
well
off
or
better
if
he
play
the
solid
twoway
game
that
our
friend
in
finland
claim
he
is
capabl
of
but
if
he
did
that
he
wouldnt
be
chal
leng
for
the
leagu
lead
in
goal
would
he
the
biplan
might
be
challeng
for

who
next
mike
foligno

what
selann
doe
best
we
do
know
what

it
is
to
win
hockey
game
what
he
doe

claim
that
he
can
play
a
solid
twoway
game
i
would
have
to
say
that
thi
style
of
contribut
would
be
more
conduc
to
win
or
dont
you
think
so
a
it
is
now
selann
is
a
grandstand
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way

watch
foligno
jump
up
and
down
after
hi

compar
him
to
foligno

i
honestli
hadnt

thi
far
it
would
help
if
