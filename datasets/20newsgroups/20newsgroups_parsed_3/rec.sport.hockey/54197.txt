minu
harri
the

becaus
of

not
in

btw
do
you

ill
bet

fourth
or
fifth
in
the
confer
behind
ani
of
the
follow
pittsburgh
quebec
boston
washington
island
someon
correct
me
if
these
five
team
will
not
be
in
montreal
confer
in
summari
thing
look
bleak
for
the
hab
at
least
in
the
near
futur
i
suspect
that
the
next
team
from
la
bell
provinc
to
win
the
cup
will
be
that
team
that
lindro
didnt
want
to
play
for
i
admit
that
ive
been
suffer
late
with
the
boston
get
hot
while
montreal
swan
in
the
playoff
type
year
but
i
do
have
the
sure
knowledg
that
the
montreal
braintrust
will
keep
plug
away
until
they
hit
the
right
formula
for
yet
anoth
cup
wherea
if
i
were
a
boston
fan
id
have
thi
kind
of
despair
that
a
long
a
harri
sinden
is
run
the
show
the
bruin
will
alway
be
good
but
never
good
enough
