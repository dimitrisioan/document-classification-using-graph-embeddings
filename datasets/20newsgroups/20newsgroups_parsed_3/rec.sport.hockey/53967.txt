and
think
of
where
the
major
of
hockey
player
come
from
from
a
farm
out
in
boondock
saskatchewan
or
weedvil
alberta
the
biggest
advantag
that
kid
from
boondock
or
weedvil
have
is
the
avail
of
ice
in
the
san
jose
area
we
have
a
popul
of
and
that
popul
is
serv
by
ice
arena
in
contrast
kamloop
british
columbia
ha
a
popul
of
about
and
ha
rink
there
are
also
myriad
pond
pool
etc
that
freez
in
the
winter
down
here
it
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a
bicycl
up
there
it
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a
pair
of
skate
and
befor
you
say
what
doe
he
know
he
from
california
let
me
say
that
i
wa
born
and
rais
in
trail
british
columbia
a
town
of
about
with
lot
of
ice
in
the
winter
my
father
did
radio
play
by
play
for
the
local
team
the
trail
smokeat
who
by
the
way
were
the
last
canadian
team
to
win
the
world
championship
back
in
i
wa
on
skate
almost
a
soon
a
i
could
walk
and
have
been
play
recreat
hockey
for
about
year
when
wa
the
last
time
you
saw
a
hockey
leagu
in
the
inner
citi
the
insur
alon
is
a
big
enough
barrier
the
inner
citi
isnt
the
onli
place
that
is
poor
i
think
the
biggest
barrier
to
hockey
in
the
inner
citi
is
no
ice
to
play
on
lack
of
ice
is
a
big
factor
but
cost
is
a
bigger
factor
both
my
kid
play
for
the
santa
clara
valley
hockey
associ
and
thi
season
which
just
end
cost
me
