last
night
game
toronto
receiv
five
penalti
detroit
none
if
which
game
were
you
watch
didnt
you
see
the
third
period
when
the
wing
had
penalti
call
on
them
and
then
a
delay
penalti
the
leaf
had
a
man
advantag
for
about
a
minut
and
a
man
advantag
for
anoth
minut
or
two
and
the
leaf
still
couldnt
score
and
i
wonder
how
the
leaf
score
a
powerplay
goal
if
accord
to
you
they
never
had
a
powerplay
in
the
detroit
paper
today
it
said
there
were
penalti
call
in
last
night
game
and
your
say
detroit
had
none
of
those
penalti
im
guess
you
onli
watch
the
first
period
i
have
to
admitt
the
leaf
did
get
alot
of
penalti
in
that
period
where
a
the
wing
didnt
get
mani
if
ani
at
all
havent
look
at
the
box
score
yet
but
the
ref
more
than
made
up
for
it
in
the
third
period
lauri

go
wing
my
apolog
for
the
typo
i
meant
the
wing
had
power
play
in
the
first
period
and
the
leaf
none
a
well
my
point
isnt
that
the
ref
were
bias
just
that
they
were
call
a
lot
of
penalti
which
work
to
the
benefit
of
the
wing
have
the
ref
call
a
whole
bunch
of
penalti
against
one
team
then
call
a
bunch
against
the
other
to
make
up
for
it
take
a
lot
away
from
what
could
have
been
a
great
game
