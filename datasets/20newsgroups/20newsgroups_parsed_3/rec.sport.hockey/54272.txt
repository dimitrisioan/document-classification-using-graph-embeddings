i
think
the
threehead
gm
guid
principl
wa
to
keep
veteran
in
favor
of
youngster
onli
if
they
offer
a
signific
advantag
doesnt
sound
like
a
bad
strategi
to
me
no
and
in
fact
that
wa
ferreira
origin
strategi
which
the
troika
proceed
to
simpli
continu
to
implement
there
wasnt
exactli
a
radic
shift
in
polici
when
he
wa
oust
someth
peopl
seem
to
forget
the
onli
real
question
is
whether
they
did
it
a
well
a
ferreira
could
have
if
he
stay
or
whether
the
basic
strategi
wa
flaw
sinc
ferreira
ha
been
quoat
a
say
he
go
to
do
someth
differ
in
anaheim
with
the
duck
my
guess
is
that
it
wasnt
a
good
in
practic
a
it
wa
on
paper
and
he
tweak
it
a
bit
second
time
around
one
also
ha
to
wonder
whether
the
strategi
would
have
been
a
lot
better
if
we
hadnt
had
those
injuri
and
whether
were
complain
about
the
weather
becaus
an
earthquak
collaps
the
root
cellar
of
cours
ferreira
had
also
trade
a
number
of
veteran
with
margin
contribut
befor
he
wa
fire
so
it
not
clear
that
thi
would
have
been
differ
besid
they
were
margin
contributor
let
also
not
forget
that
ferreira
came
thi
close
to
trade
kelli
kisio
which
if
the
rumor
ive
heard
are
true
wa
over
the
strong
object
of
other
aspect
of
shark
manag
and
probabl
had
a
lot
to
do
with
both
hi
ouster
and
the
threehead
consensu
orient
gm
imagin
for
a
second
where
the
shark
would
be
today
if
that
fax
machin
hadnt
jam
with
or
without
mullen
they
werent
go
to
be
a
playoff
team
what
good
doe
it
do
them
to
hang
onto
a
player
whod
rather
be
elsewher
especi
an
unhappi
player
that
isnt
play
a
well
becaus
of
it
not
that
id
accus
mullen
of
tank
but
hi
motiv
simpli
wasnt
there
and
that
kind
of
thing
can
affect
the
team
an
exampl
from
thi
season
skriko
wa
brought
in
on
a
trial
basi
but
not
kept
becaus
of
hi
age
i
thought
he
wa
a
decent
contributor
worth
keep
around
the
youth
movement
ha
it
advantag
look
at
gaudreau
who
might
still
be
in
kc
if
more
veteran
had
been
kept
around
but
you
have
to
find
the
right
balanc
right
balanc
for
what
that
the
issu
exactli
at
the
time
they
let
skriko
go
we
hadnt
yet
had
the
major
injuri
bug
that
kill
u
later
id
much
rather
have
skriko
around
than
someon
like
dean
kolstad
but
at
that
point
that
wasnt
the
choic
and
sinc
the
choic
wa
more
one
of
skriko
v
someon
like
john
carter
i
think
the
right
choic
wa
made
for
that
time
period
