far
greater
than

idea
if

is
and
we
can
then
teach

someth
abotu
the

i
cant
disagre
with
you
here
the
histori
of

can
be
put
rather
succinctli
all
of

can
you
imagin
a
pocklington
divis
a
ballard
divis
or
how
about
a
green
divis
no
i
would
not
want
to
see
a
ballard
divis
but
to
say
that
these
owner
are
asshol
henc
all
nhl

asshol
would
be
fallaci
conn
smyth
for

i
have
heard
what
have
you
heard
the
major
wa
the

littl
asshol
he
origin
the
phrase
if
you
cant
beat

you
cant
beat
em
on

that
wa
hi
idea
of
hockey
do
you
think
by
chanc
that
don
cherri
is
a

individu
also
isnt
the
point
of
profession
hockey
to
make
money
for
all
those
involv
which
would
includ
the
player
what
i
think
you
might
be
say
is
that
the
player
have
not
made
a
much
money
a
should
have
been
their
due
and
it
is
the
player
that
are
what
make
the
game
great
not
the
peopl
who
put
them
on
the
ice
so
name
divis
after

peopl
rather
than
player
is
ad
insult
in
the

than
wa
deserv
the

issu
is
irrelev

that

it
is

not
the

who
put

exactli
true
name
divis
