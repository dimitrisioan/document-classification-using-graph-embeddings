there

a

adjust
is
hi
raw
team
adjust
btw
if
anyon
could
calcul
and
post
adjust
rate
it
would
be
greatli
appreci
i
might
find
the
time
to
do
so
but
dont
count
on
it
i
have
a
databas
filter
set
up
for
the
player
stat
when
it
is
post
for
the
end
of
season
ill
repost
the
team
averag
you
dont
need
to
go
through
the
complic
team
adjust
you
are
use
all
you
need
is
the
team
averag
by
sum
all
the
individu
player
and
divid
by
the
total
number
of
player
on
the
team
thi
will
be
a
littl
distort
becaus
the
player
who
have
been
trade
recent
will
have
come
with
score
base
on
their
origin
team
thi
shouldnt
distort
it
too
bad
though
if
you
want
to
look
at
individu
player
from
thi
perspect
then
go
ahead
youll
requir
the
origin
player
stat
though
question
if
a
team
us
player
in
a
season
do
you
mere
divid
the
total
by
if
so
a
player
who
play
in
onli
game
is
consid
equal
valuabl
a
a
player
who
play
in
all
of
them
anoth
way
of
look
at
the
same
thing
is
to
compar
the
deviat
from
the
mean
for
the
team
of
the
player
to
the
standard
deviat
for
the
team
ill
post
both
sinc
the
standard
deviat
for
each
team
is
differ
i
am
unsur
how
transfer
between
team
that
these
stat
are
shouldnt
the
averag
standard
deviat
in
the
leagu
be
use
i
am
interest
in
see
each
method
but
i
still
think
that
mine
is
