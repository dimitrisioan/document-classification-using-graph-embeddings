the

overcam
the
red
wing
in
what
wa
possibl
the
most
excit
game
play
yet
in
thi
playoff
year
perhap
it
wa
the
most
excit
game
play
yet
that
you
have
seen
for
most
of
u
who
watch
team
around
the
leagu
with
interest
and
object
it
wa
nowher
near
the
most
excit
game
paul
stewart
call
the
singl
worst
game
ive
seen
thi
year
federov
major
wa
obviou
and
i
dont
disput
it
howev
chaisson
penalti
shouldnt
even
have
been
a
penalti
let
alon
a
major
and
a
game
misconduct
the
minut
game
misc
call
is
for
high
stick
onli
there
is
no
blood
penalti
just
becaus
chaisson
bare
touch
the
poor
sap
and
he
hit
the
dasher
and
bled
profus
doesnt
mean
it
is
a
penalti
unfortun
the
instant
replay
is
not
use
on
hit
at
first
i
immedi
thought
and
a
game
becaus
the
hit
look
much
more
sever
from
an
intenttoinjur
perspect
than
it
wa
after
see
the
replay
id
say
it
deserv
minut
for
board
it
wa
careless
ani
way
you
slice
it
if
stewart
had
replay
i
do
not
think
chaisson
would
have
gotten
and
the
game
in
the
second
period
behind
potvin
probert
had
the
puck
and
wa
go
to
get
out
front
and
wa
tackl
i
couldnt
believ
the
nocal
thi
nocal
wa
bullshit
i
agre
i
admir
stewart
for
let
them
go
but
probert
look
up
say
where
the
hell
is
the
penalti
ive
never
seen
probert
whine
either
he
doesnt
need
to
now
if
probi
decid
to
put
wendel
through
the
board
he
probabl
gone
right
i
dont
rememb
who
on
the
leaf
touch
the
puck
on
racin
shot
toward
the
end
of
the
game
second
left
but
stewart
call
it
out
of
play
last
touch
by
detroit
everybodi
in
the
garden
includ
the
linesman
knew
it
yzerman
protest
but
stewart
just
laugh
and
realli
homer
the
wing
thi
wa
also
bullshit
but
onc
again
no
replay
it
wa
rous
btw
im
realli
piss
that
the
linesman
didnt
correct
the
call
eitherit
b
when
the
offici
refus
to
admit
they
made
a
mistak
but
when
it
all
come
down
to
it
wing
play
like
shit
ye
the
call
you
describ
should
not
have
the
differ
in
a
detroit
loss
i
pick
the
leaf
to
win
game
on
emot
and
adrenalin
but
the
wing
have
no
excus
for
game
they
should
be
the
superior
team
the
call
that
piss
me

for
put
hi
stick
in
somebodi
