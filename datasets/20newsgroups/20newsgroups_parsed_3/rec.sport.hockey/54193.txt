think
he
would
make
a
good
polic
offici
a
for
pilon
he
cant
carri
the
puck
out
to
center
ice
by
himself
he
either
make
a
bad
pa
result
in
a
turnov
or
he
attempt
to
bring
the
puck
toward
the
neutral
zone
and
skate
right
into
an
oppos
skater
he
cant
stay
on
hi
skate
with
most
forward
or
center
he
either
fall
down
or
committ
a

a
difficult
to
figur
out
a
the

two
good
team
with
talent
but
so
inconsist
they
should
meet
in
the
first
round
the
isl
seem
to
play
up
to
the
level
of
their
competit
so
they
should
play

i
wish
when

they
could
continu
to
pour
it
on
instead
of
settl
back
into
a
defens
shell
and
let
the
