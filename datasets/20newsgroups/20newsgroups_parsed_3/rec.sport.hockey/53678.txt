write
so
roussel
wa
give
up
almost
anoth
goal
a
game
while
face
a
proport
number
of
shot
for
the
number
of
minut
he
play
and
while
i
havet
actual
check
i
believ
that
he
face
a
lower
qualiti
of
oppon
make
that
le
than
half
a
goal
a
game
the
lower
qualiti
of
opponet
argument
is
immateri
a
neither
roussel
nor
soderstrom
had
ani
say
in
the
matter
that
wa
dineen
decis
so
in
other
word
if
roussel
shut
out
the
shark
and
soderstrom
shut
out
the
penguin
that
immateri
becaus
it
wa
the
coach
decis
come
on
joe
think
about
what
your
say
who
they
play
is
veri
signific
whi
they
play
them
is
what
irrelev
a
low
gaa
against
good
team
is
better
than
a
low
gaa
against
bad
team
in
the
context
of
compar
two
goaltend
a
low
gaa
is
better
then
a
higher
gaa
a
low
gaa
against
good
team
is
much
much
better
than
a
higher
gaa
against
bad
team
in
the
context
of
compar
two
goaltend
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
despit
last
night
shutout
he
doesnt
have
what
it
take
last
night
wa
due
to
an
inept
ranger
team
much
more
than
roussel
skill
a
on
and
they
dont
get
a
shot
away
a
on
none
and
one
guy
just
pas
and
stop
the
other
guy
shoot
into
roussel
pad
cmon
pete
so
the
ranger
were
inept
a
shutout
is
a
shutout
dure
both
of
soderstrom
masterpiec
against
toronto
mike
emerich
wa
quot
a
say
he
didnt
think
the
leaf
had
much
offens
firepow
past
their
first
line
doe
that
make
soderstrom
shutout
le
impress
becaus
of
toronto
lack
of
offens
ye
it
doe
absolut
in
the
context
of
compar
two
goaltend
of
cours
at
the
end
of
the
season
point
is
point
no
matter
how
you
get
them
and
on
the
score
sheet
shutout
are
shutout
but
if
your
a
coach
decid
between
two
goali
or
a
gm
look
to
make
a
trade
you
have
got
to
look
deeper
than
the
stat
sheet
i
didnt
see
the
second
toronto
game
but
the
first
one
wa
a
defens
masterpiec
there
wa
noth
in
that
game
to
judg
tommi
soderstrom
on
becaus
he
wasnt
test
the
same
for
roussel
in
the
ranger
game
two
real
score
chanc
one
he
made
a
great
play
the
other
he
wa
save
by
a
mistak
from
the
other
player
if
you
were
judg
roussel
on
that
game
alon
you
have
veri
littl
to
go
by
but
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
tie
against
the
hab
you
saw
a
goali
stand
on
hi
head
to
get
that
shutout
that
wa
a
goali
in
action
roussel
doesnt
have
a
game
like
that
in
him
well
if
you
look
back
to
novemb
when
roussel
wa
the
goali
soderstrom
wa
be
treat
for
hi
heart
ailment
the
flyer
finish
novemb
at
and
were
overal
and
there
no
way
of
know
where
the
flyer
would
have
finish
if
soderstom
wasnt
wear
the
oragn
n
black
im
glad
we
dont
have
to
find
out
anytim
soon
either
becaus
he
is
one
hell
of
a
player
i
would
take
him
over
roussel
right
now
but
i
still
think
dom
ha
what
it
take
to
be
the
guy
he
outperform
hextal
enough
dure
the
season
to
make
flyer
manag
think
that
way
too
dont
be
so
sure
of
that
flyer
manag
never
say
bad
thing
about
roussel
but
they
dont
say
too
much
on
the
good
side
either
ive
seen
at
least
two
interview
where
everi
time
farwel
wa
ask
how
happi
he
wa
to
have
two
good
goaltend

wa
tommi
