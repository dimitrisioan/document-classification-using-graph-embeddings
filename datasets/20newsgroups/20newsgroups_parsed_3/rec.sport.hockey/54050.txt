i
said
gund
will
have
to
open
hi
checkbook
i
didnt
say
give
up
ani
draft
pick
or
promis
talent
if
we
could
have
gotten
murphi
for
the
m
great
but
i
agre
the
shark
shouldnt
give
up
young
talent
or
earli
round
draft
pick
i
list
chelio
et
al
onli
to
indic
the
type
of
player
i
think
the
shark
need
to
pick
up
the
rule
on
sign
free
agent
le
than
year
old
put
a
big
restrict
on
what
the
shark
can
pick
up
howev
i
do
believ
they
need
to
pick
up
some
player
who
will
add
tough
to
the
team
but
you
have
to
rememb
that
your
unlik
to
get
ani
real
qualiti
free
agent
who
do
not
requir
compens
the
shark
tri
with
makarov
who
wa
probabl
the
top
of
the
class
among
noncompens
free
agent
but
even
he
probabl
wouldnt
have
help
too
much
dont
expect
to
get
top
qualiti
just
some
tough
i
dont
view
makarov
a
a
player
who
would
add
tough
size
hope
wont
be
much
of
a
worri
next
year
alexand
cherbayev
and
michal
sykora
have
agre
to
multiyear
contract
and
it
appear
that
mike
rathj
will
also
sign
soon
all
three
are
pretti
big
size
alon
isnt
enough
we
all
know
how
much
fear
kolstad
struck
in
the
eye
of
oppon
not
well
rathj
and
sykora
are
both
highli
tout
prospect
unlik
kolstad
and
cherbayev
wa
initi
suppos
to
play
for
the
russian
wc
team
anybodi
know
what
happen
there
that
mean
that
he
like
to
be
good
enough
nelson
your
confus
skill
and
tough
mcgillhammond
johan
garpenlov
would
you
realli
rather
have
those
two
instead
of
johan
by
your
logic
then
you
enjoy
have
falloon
and
ozolinsh
on
injur
reserv
by
your
logic
then
you
think
that
if
the
shark
had
kept
mcgill
and
hammond
that
you
can
guarante
that
falloon
and
ozolinsh
wouldnt
have
gotten
hurt
think
again
there
wa
a
chanc
that
mcgill
would
have
caus
ozolinsh
to
get
stuck
at
kc
and
a
you
know
hammond
is
worthless
and
mcgill
is
almost
worthless
well
wilson
mayb
but
i
dont
think
falloon
and
ozolinsh
were
realli
injur
on
cheapshot
who
said
they
were
if
they
werent
then
i
dont
see
ani
justif
that
have
mcgill
and
hammond
around
would
prevent
their
injuri
if
the
injuri
of
falloon
and
ozolinsh
were
pure
accident
then
what
could
mcgill
and
hammond
have
done
to
prevent
them
hey
get
off
the
mcgillhammond
thing
im
no
fan
of
either
my
point
is
that
last
year
the
shark
had
tough
that
wa
miss
thi
year
thi
year
we
had
more
skill
im
all
for
that
but
if
your
skill
player
keep
get
beat
up
and
injur
they
cant
do
you
much
good
whether
it
a
cheap
shot
or
not
you
cant
let
the
other
team
push
you
around
the
shark
simpli
got
push
around
to
much
other
team
knew
thi
they
knew
they
could
aggress
check
the
shark
and
not
pay
for
it
ad
some
player
in
the
off
season
who
will
add
some
tough
to
the
team
will
help
insur
that
next
season
other
team
will
be
more
hesist
to
vigor
check
our
skill
player
or
to
take
cheap
shot
it
doesnt
guarante
no
injuri
noth
doe
but
it
someth
the
shark
can
do
to
reduc
the
number
of
injuri
mark
