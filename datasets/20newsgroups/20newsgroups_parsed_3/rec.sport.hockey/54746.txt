from
in
articl
smith
write
i
dont
think
he
shown
that
he
good
enough
to
carri
detroit
to
the
cup
the
team
may
be
good
enough
to
reach
the
final
but
chevelda
is
their
achil
heel
you
must
have
goaltend
in
the
playoff
and
chevelda
look
like
an
overmatch
nd
or
rd
stringer
which
he
probabl
i
guess
i
dont
know
of
too
mani
nd
or
rd
string
goali
that
could
post
over
win
in
a
season
chevi
ha
done
that
the
past
two
season
play
behind
a
defens
that
is
not
exactli
the
best
in
the
leagu
hi
win
thi
year
were
not
all
against
toronto
and
for
those
who
look
at
vincent
rien
stat
and
think
he
should
be
start
take
a
look
at
the
team
he
play
against
team
like
san
jose
ottawa
and
tb
ani
nhl
goali
could
post
a
decent
record
play
team
like
that
night
in
and
night
out
is
look
for
detroit
manag
to
remedi
the
situat
in
the
offseason
i
realli
dont
see
thi
happen
if
they
didnt
think
chevelda
could
do
the
job
they
would
of
trade
for
somebodi
thi
year
after
all
whi
wait
until
next
year
when
there
were
goali
avail
thi
year
hey
i
may
be
wrong
but
after
watch
him
kick
rebound
after
rebound
into
the
high
slot
i
dont
think
he
can
carri
them
in
the
tough
game
ie
those
not
against
toronto
better
to
kick
out
rebound
than
to
let
goal
in
if
st
loui
get
past
chicago
watch
for
joseph
to
carri
the
blue
past
an
otherwis
vastli
superior
red
wing
club
joseph
is
hot
but
so
are
the
wing
they
have
score
six
goal
in
both
of
their
game
so
far
with
toronto
suppos
one
of
the
leagu
best
defens
i
guess
if
they
end
up
play
for
the
norri
titl
well
see
what
happen
drd
the
devil
advoc
drinkin
woman
gun
dont
mix
mark
arm
kc
wing
in
or
hope
by
a
far
a
chevelda
is
concern
he
is
a
decent
goali
the
most
logic
trade
in
the
offseason
to
me
would
be
between
detroit
and
ny
ranger
im
sure
if
beezer
would
be
trade
he
would
enjoy
the
opportun
to
go
back
to
hi
root
in
detroit
he
would
be
a
valuabl
asset
to
the
wing
and
perhap
the
ranger
could
get
a
zombo
in
return
beezer
got
a
few
good
year
in
him
and
the
opportun
to
get
a
fresh
start
would
energ
hi
play
