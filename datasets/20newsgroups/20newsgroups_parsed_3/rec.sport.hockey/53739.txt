re
div
and
conf
name
in
deepak
chhabra
write
howev
that
asid
the
real
question
is
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
chang
the
name
base
on
the
reason
given
for
it
make
it
easier
for
the
casual
fan
or
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
uniqu
division
name
base
on
individu
who
do
deserv
the
honour
imo
the
latter
is
a
nice
and
uniqu
touch
that
differ
from
other
sport
in
addit
i
do
not
think
that
chang
division
name
will
have
an
effect
on
the
number
of
peopl
that
are
interest
in
hockey
so
it
a
pointless
exercis
anyway
there
are
sever
problem
with
the
way
the
game
is
be
present
to
the
fan
i
feel
that
geograph
name
would
enhanc
region
loyalti
more
than
name
honour
personag
and
of
cours
they
would
not
appear
nearli
a
confus
to
one
approach
the
sport
for
the
first
time
anoth
thing
that
bother
me
is
the
point
system
percentag
a
use
in
the
other
major
sport
are
clearli
more
inform
when
i
look
at
the
nhl
stand
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
quick
calcul
to
account
for
game
in
hand
which
is
almost
alway
the
case
some
will
object
to
percentag
claim
perhap
that
it
is
an
american
of
the
sport
but
i
feel
that
use
percentag
is
more
inform
and
whether
it
is
american
or
not
is
irrelev
if
the
current
name
are
inappropri
then
that
is
a
separ
issu
not
central
to
the
origin
articl
someth
to
consid
addit
is
whether
or
not
player
like
orr
who
contribut
to
the
glori
of
the
sport
would
have
been
abl
to
do
so
without
an
organ
profession
leagu
to
play
in
in
thi
case
honour
builder
of
the
leagu
a
oppos
to
builder
of
the
sport
becom
a
chickenandegg
type
question
although
it
wa
the
chicken
even
if
orr
couldnt
have
contribut
without
the
like
of
norri
you
would
have
to
agre
that
norri
couldnt
have
contribut
without
the
like
of
orr
and
take
a
poll
of
most
fan
would
quickli
tell
you
who
the
fan
feel
made
the
more
meaning

exactli
true

after

kind
of
