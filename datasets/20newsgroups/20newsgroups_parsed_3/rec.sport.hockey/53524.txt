a
littl
more
interest
last

pen
that
mean
if
the

in
the

howev
i
have
some
more
comment
on
the
island
and
hockey
in
gener
that
i
need
to
get
off
my
chest
first
of
all
with
the
island
backtoback
lacklust
perform
against
the
whaler
one
may
think
that
the
island
are
out
of
shape
these
guy
alway
suck
wind
in
the
nd
period
come
on
a
littl
in
the
rd
and
run
out
of
ga
too
soon
it
is
unbeliev
how
mani
one
goal
game
these
guy
have
lost
anyway
the
game
wa
pretti
wide
open
the
isl
still
have
ton
of
troubl
score
the
whaler
play
a
goli
in
is
st
nhl
start
i
think
hi
name
wa
lenarduzzi
sp
hi
nhl
debut
wa
the
tuesday
tie
against
the
isl
like
i
mention
befor
thi
guy
look
like
the
best
goli
on
the
planet
for
a
while
until
he
misplay
a
mahlakov
slap
shot
to
go
to
ot
i
say
it
becaus
the
isl
dont
shoot
correctli
ha
anyon
els
notic
thi
also
i
think
it
is
realli
a
shame
for
hockey
when
i
guy
like
mick
vukota
get
a
much
ice
time
a
he
doe
thi
guy
ha
about
a
much
hockey
talent
a
jigg
macdonald
who
did
play
hockey
i
think
anytim
he
get
the
puck
it
get
stolen
and
he
alway
start
fight
and
get
needl
penalti
richard
pilon
is
anoth
guy
who
is
on
the
ice
to
stir
up
crap
and
he
a
defenseman
he
got
to
be
approach
neg
infin
for
hi
plusminu
thi
guy
get
beaten
all
the
time
whi
the
need
for
such
enforc
not
onli
do
fight
slow
the
game
down
alot
but
it
take
away
from
the
guy
who
are
realli
tri
to
play
the
game
ill
be
one
of
the
few
to
admit
i
do
enjoy
a
good
fight
onc
in
a
while
but
onli
when
it
call
for
you
know
when
a
guy
check
the
goali
too
hard
in
other
word
a
violat
of
hockey
ethic
might
caus
you
to
get
puch
but
there
is
no
need
to
start
crap
when
you
are
lose
or
becuas
you
can
get
away
with
it
doe
anyon
agre
that
refere
need
to
be
a
littl
le
lenient
in
the
rd
and
ot
i
mean
come
on
alreadi
im
sick
of
see
team
pull
guy
down
hold
guy
etc
just
becuas
the
refere
doesnt
call
it
ot
and
late
in
the
rd
should
be
a
time
for
strategi
not
physic
prowess
tri
to
set
up
a
goal
should
be
first
and
foremost
if
you
are
so
afraid
that
the
other
team
is
go
to
score
that
you
have
to
pull
a
guy
down
to
prevent
it
you
dont
deserv
to
win
in
the
first
place
just
my
honest
opinion
