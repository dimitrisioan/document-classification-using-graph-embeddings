i
wa

nanci
leapt
out

fist
high
in

way
to
go
nanci
thi
seri
is
still
too
close
to
call
tuesday
game
may
be
the
decid
one
i
expect
king
might
put
vernon
back
in
even
though
rees
had
two
good
game
in
la
rees
ha
histor
been
good
in
la
thi
wa
onli
the
second
time
he
lost
there
thi
move
would
be
good
for
the
king
sinc
vernon
is
such
a
siev
i
am
sure
that
stauber
will
get
the
call
for
the
king
stauber
will
be
in
net
on
tuesday
hope
he
will
provid
anoth
stellar
perform
and
earn
the
name
robb
stopper
stauber
the
firswt
two
line
of
the
king
have
to
wake
up
while
it
is
great
to
see
you
can
not
depend
on
pat
conach
and
warren
rychel
for
all
of
your
offens
i
expect
sandstrom
granato
and
gretzki
might
be
put
back
togeth
on
a
line
like
they
were
earli
in
the
season
thi
would
leav
kurri
carson
and
luc
a
the
second
on
paper
these
two
line
look
power
let
see
if
they
can
make
it
real
i
believ
thi
is
how
they
arei
know
it
is
gretzki
and
sandstrom
but
he
ha
been
put
a
number
of
peopl
on
left
also
the
carson
robatail
kurri
line
onc
ignit
will
light
the
fire
of
the
other
line
hope
go
king
dvb
it
is
evid
that
the
score
drought
is
get
to
luc
after
hi
slight
breakaway
in
the
third
i
think
he
wa
steam
on
the
bench
thi
emot
might
help
him
break
hi
streak
also
i
have
notic
blake
ha
had
a
few
realli
good
chanc
to
score
but
ha
fan
or
shot
wide
is
the
injuri
still
affect
him
