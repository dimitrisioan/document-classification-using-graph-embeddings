mathew
tasalloti
say
chanc
thi
year
but
it
seem
to
me
like
washington
is
the
onli
team
that
can
stop
the
penguin
from
win
their
next
stanley
cup
realli
i
think
both
the
island
and
devil
would
have
a
better
chanc
at
the
penguin
than
the
capit
imo
robbi
po
pgh
penguin
it
wont
be
easi
but
it
contact
for
the
stanley
cup
will
have
greater
reward
penn
state
ladi
lion
champion
mountain
and
valley
are
straight
win
better
than
noth
at
all
realli
what
make
you
think
the
island
have
a
better
shot
they
couldnt
even
beat
the
whaler
in
two
game
well
sinc
your
a
pen
fan
the
whole
question
is
moot
i
think
the
team
most
like
to
beat
the
pen
are
the
bruin
nordiqu
and
blackhawk
but
i
dont
think
they
can
realli
do
it
