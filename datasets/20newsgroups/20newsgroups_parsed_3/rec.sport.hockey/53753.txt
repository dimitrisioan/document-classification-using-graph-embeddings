you
obvious
dont
understand
how
tv
schedul
work
espn
had
prior
contract
to
basebal
to
show
monday
night
game
and
had
contract
all
the
other
b
show
well
in
advanc
the
nhl
tv
deal
wa
veri
late
in
the
schedul
process
you
normal
have
to
do
thi
oneplu
year
out
the
nhl
packag
wa
finish
two
week
befor
the
season
start
espn
ha
shown
tremend
commit
to
the
nhl
by
squeez
in
extra
telecast
when
it
could
like
the
last
minnesota
game
and
put
stanley
cup
game
a
backup
to
their
basebal
telecast
which
by
favor
circumst
they
could
pull
off
last
night
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
espn
can
not
break
contract
at
will
they
must
honor
the
previou
deal
they
made
doe
have
someth
to
do
with
it
especi
if
you
risk
a
lawsuit
for
breach
of
contract
with
basebal
so
relax
im
happi
i
dont
get
sportschannel
anyway
