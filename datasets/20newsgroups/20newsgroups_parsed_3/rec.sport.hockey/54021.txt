when

year
ago
not
last
year
they
regularili
miss
the
playoff
i
cant
recal
if
they
miss
the
playoff
the
year
befor
hi
hire
but
they
probabl
did
quinn
ha
improv
the
team
from
nonplayoff
calibr
to
a
seriou
contend
when
murray
took
over
in
detroit
the
were
about
a
team
that
wa
a
contend
to
win
the
norri
divis
and
possibl
even
a
stanley
cup
contend
the
last
year
befor
bryan
murray
took
over
the
wing
did
not
make
the
playoff
while
they
had
been
consid
a
possibl
contend
when
jacqu
demer
first
arriv
in
hi
last
two
year
they
were
respect
embarrass
in
the
first
round
by
chicago
and
then
fail
to
make
the
playoff
at
a
time
a
might
add
when
there
were
onli
five
team
in
the
norri
it
true
that
vancouv
did
not
make
the
playoff
for
mani
a
year
befor
quinn
came
but
in
those
year
the
smyth
divis
wa
a
loti
mean
a
lot
tougher
divis
than
the
norri
also
known
a
the
snorri
divis
vancouv
had
to
play
edmonton
and
calgari
both
veri
legitim
stanley
cup
contend
eight
time
a
year
while
detroit
got
to
play
such
powerhous
a
toronto
and
minnesota
now
edmonton
is
hardli
even
a
forc
in
the
leagu
and
the
smyth
even
ha
the
mighti
san
jose
shark
while
over
thi
same
period
of
time
in
which
vancouv
wa
improv
so
wa
everybodi
in
the
norri
except
st
loui
detroit
had
to
improv
just
to
keep
up
with
the
competit
in
their
divis
they
had
to
improv
a
lot
to
get
better
than
their
competit
in
the
norri
bryan
murray
inherit
a
team
with
veri
littl
talent
for
realli
good
player
they
had
yzerman
burr
and
probert
and
that
wa
about
it
and
no
doubt
some
will
disput
whether
burr
and
probert
were
that
good
the
rest
were
either
veri
green
rooki
or
wash
up
veteran
the
onli
reason
they
got
a
far
a
they
did
in
the
year
befor
murray
came
wa
due
to
the
coach
of
demer
who
at
least
at
first
got
everi
last
ounc
of
effort
possibl
out
of
hi
team
then
even
hi
coach
began
to
degrad
so
quinn
ha
improv
hi
team
more
than
murray
ha
sinc
take
over
a
a
gm
quinn
is
one
exampl
of
a
better
gm
than
murray
there
are
a
number
of
reason
whi
detroit
wasnt
in
a
bad
a
shape
stand
wise
when
murray
took
over
a
vanc
wa
when
quinn
took
over
some
of
which
i
outlin
abov
but
murray
did
not
have
ani
better
personnel
to
work
with
at
the
outset
than
did
quinn
with
the
except
of
yzerman
and
one
player
can
not
alon
make
a
team
into
a
stanley
cup
contend
a
im
sure
everyon
read
thi
will
agre
well
be
abl
to
see
better
which
team
is
realli
the
most
improv
when
they
face
each
other
in
the
confer
final
assum
they
dont
get
knock
out
like
