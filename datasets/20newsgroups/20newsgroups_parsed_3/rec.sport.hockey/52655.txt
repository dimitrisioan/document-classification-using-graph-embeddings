of
team
montreal
ha
now
they
can
take
the
cup
easili
the
onli
problem
they
have
right
now
is
that
everyon
is
tri
to
steal
the
show
and
play
alon
they
need
some
massiv
teamwork
thi
is
known
a
the
savard
syndrom
and
we
are
talk
deni
not
serg
no
team
will
ever
win
squat
with
the
like
of
deni
savard
in
their
lineup
they
could
tell
savard
to
stay
home
and
watch
the
game
on
tv
if
life
were
so
simpl
savard
ha
not
play
in
three
of
the
last

like
crap
montreal
problem
run
deeper
than
savard
and
mouton
unfortun
i
hope
they
can
get
their
act
togeth
befor
the
playoff
the
lineup
in
their
game
come
up
against
pittsburgh
is
said
to
be
the
one
theyr
like
to
use
for
the
playoff
let
hope
they
can
forget
about
the
nice
weather
