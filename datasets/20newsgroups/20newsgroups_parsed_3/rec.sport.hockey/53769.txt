goal
shouldnt
have
count
the
game
would
have
end
in
tie
i
thought
the
red
light
went
onthu
in
the
review
the
presumpt
would
be
to
find
conclus
evid
that
the
puck
did
not
go
in
the
netfrom
the
replay
i
say
even
from
the
rear
the
evid
wasnt
conclus
that
the
puck
wa
in
or
outin
my
opinion
i
wa
under
the
impress
that
the
object
is
to
find
conclus
evid
that
the
puck
did
cross
the
line
and
the
replay
i
saw
show
