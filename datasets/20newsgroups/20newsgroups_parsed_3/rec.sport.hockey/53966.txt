thi

not

away
from
jaro
who
had
a
decent
year
although
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
expect
of
some

tend

i
am
pretti
sure
that
jagr
had
more
point
per

play
that
franci
when
you
add
to
that
jagr
better
rate
i
think
it
becom
evid
that
jagr
had
a
better

not
that
franci
had
a

one
actual
what
i
think
ha
becom
more
evid
is
that
you
are
determin
to
flaunt
your

all
cost
jagr
did
not
have
