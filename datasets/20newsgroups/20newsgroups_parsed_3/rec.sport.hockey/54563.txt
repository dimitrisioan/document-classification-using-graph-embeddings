mani
peopl
have
suggest
that
fuhr
play
is
the
onli
reason
that
the
sabr
beat
the
bruin
while
fuhr
wa
a
critic
factor
i
would
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
sabr
final
got
some
score
from
peopl
other
than
mogilni
and
lafontain
khmylev
sweeney
hawerchuck
etc
inde
lafontain
play
hurt
and
didnt
score
mani
goal
also
the
team
play
better
defens
although
not
great
than
in
the
regular
season
fuhr
deserv
a
lot
of
credit
but
not
all
of
it
robert
a
i
agre
with
thi
i
also
think
fuhr
contribut
for
sabre
win
is
just
the
same
a
mani
palyer
in
the
team
mogilni
had
six
goal
in
four
game
includ
two
goal
for
the
great
comeback
in
the
final
win
after
fuhr
had
left
the
key
for
sabre
win
over
boston
is
whole
team
strong
commit
a
an
underdog
and
all
their
talent
player
includ
mogilni
and
fuhr
i
think
that
grant
fuhr
deserv
more
credit
than
that
while
it
true
that
the
entir
sabr
team
play
veri
well
i
still
believ
that
if
it
wasnt
for
grant
fuhr
the
seri
would
now
be
tie
he
virtual
stole
game
and
for
the
sabr
in
both
of
these
game
fuhr
stood
on
hi
head
to
give
the
sabr
the
chanc
to
win
especi
in
game
fuhr
made
a
seri
of
huge
stop
in
the
third
period
when
the
score
wa
tie
even
in
game
when
the
sabr
won
the
score
seem
to
indic
that
the
sabr
domin
howev
if
it
hadnt
been
for
fuhr
the
sabr
wouldnt
have
been
up
i
think
it
wa
through
the
nd
period
and
the
bruin
wouldnt
have
had
to
open
up
the
game
therebi
allow
mogilni
to
score
the
third
goal
on
a
breakaway
to
salt
away
the
game
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
fuhr
wa
the
critic
factor
in
the
victori
in
my
opinion
neeli
oat
and
juneau
play
a
well
a
lafontain
mogilni
and
hawerchuk
the
sabr
did
get
extraordinari
effort
from
hannan
sweeney
wood
and
khmylev
compar
to
that
of
the
bruin
checker
howev
the
bruin
defens
imo
play
better
than
the
sabr
defens
the
sabr
have
ken
sutton
play
a
regular
shift
afteral
