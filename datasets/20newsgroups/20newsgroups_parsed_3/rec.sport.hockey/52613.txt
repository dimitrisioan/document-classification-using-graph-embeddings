fencesittinglook
at
philli
record
with
eric
and
without
there
is
no
doubt
soderstrom
is
probabl
the
biggest
surpris
re
eric
true
but
fortun
we
didnt
get
to
find
out
what
they
would
be
like
without
recchi
for
game
soderstrom
absolut
shutout
in
game
for
a
rooki
without
a
lot
of
defens
in
front
of
him
runnerup
to
galley
and
fedyk
who
are
score
a
ton
over
their
career
best
but
galley
think
he
paul
coffey
put
score
ahead
of
defend
and
fedyk
ha
tail
off
big
time
eklund
wa
a
big
question
mark
thi
year
and
wa
come
off
injuri
point
in
game
is
not
bad
at
all
and
recent
he
been
a
huge
factor
in
the
win
theyv
gotten
eklund
ha
never
had
a
point
a
game
season
in
hi
career
hi
product
is
veri
typic
for
him
how
doe
he
qualifi
a
a
disappoint
if
anyth
he
a
surpris
my
choic
would
be
roussel
if
i
went
strictli
by
what
wa
expect
of
player
but
i
never
thought
that
he
had
what
it
take
to
be
a
goali
my
biggest
disappoint
is
bill
dineen
i
thought
that
he
wa
go
to
be
the
perfect
coach
for
thi
young
team
instead
he
made
too
mani
bad
move
and
imho
ha
cost
them
enough
game
to
keep
them
out
of
the
playoff
thi
year
ani
coach
that
think
put
eric
lindro
at
the
point
on
power
play
is
a
bright
idea
need
to
go
back
to
coach
