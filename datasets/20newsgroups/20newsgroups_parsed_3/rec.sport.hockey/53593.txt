i

had
an

career
with

both
player
had
to

i
like
our

i
just
dont
think
the
name
you
mention
could
cut
it
a
star
in
the
nhl
even
rexi
in
hi
prime
wa
more
of
a
good

than
a
superstar
in
hi
own
right
although
some
blame
that
on
lack

ruotsaleinen
wa
a
more

he

to
the

stanley

victori
in

i

the

would
