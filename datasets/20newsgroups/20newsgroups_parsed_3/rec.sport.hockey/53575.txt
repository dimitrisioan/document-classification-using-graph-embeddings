say
chanc
thi
year
but
it
seem
to
me
like
washington
is
the
onli
team
that
can
stop
the
penguin
from
win
their
next
stanley
cup
realli
i
think
both
the
island
and
devil
would
have
a
better
chanc
at
the
penguin
than
the
capit
imo
realli
what
make
you
think
the
island
have
a
better
shot
they
couldnt
even
beat
the
whaler
in
two
game
ye
but
a
ha
been
mention
mani
time
befor
the
island
play
at
the
talent
level
of
their
oppon
sinc

piti
the

play
piti
sinc
pittsburgh
is
great
the
isl
will
most
like
play
great
thi
is
most
like
due
to
inexperi
and
veri
poor
shoot
to
greg

i
have
notic
that
the
island
couldnt
hit
the
broad

of
a

two
foot
in
front
of
it
doe
anyon
