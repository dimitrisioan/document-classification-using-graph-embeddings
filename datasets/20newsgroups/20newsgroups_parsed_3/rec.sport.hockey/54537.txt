an
entir
differ

won
i
didnt
think
about
anyth
els
i
just
watch
mario
and
all
skate
the
thing
around
the
ice
now
it
seem
to
be
more
of
a
question
whether
or
not
thirti
year
from
now
young
hockey
fan
may
there
be
million
will
still
ask
u
what
it
wa
like
to
watch
thi
team
that
what
they
are
play
for
now
but
i
wa
still
a
nervou
a
ever
when
the
devil
were
blast
shot
at
barrasso
in
the
final
second
of
game
three
so
the
fun
is
far
from
over
yet
im
not
bore
either
most
peopl
i
know
say
that
win
the
second
cup
wa
better
than
the
first
but
to
me
noth
will
ever
top
that
first
one
but
im
everi
bit
a
excit
thi
year
and
i
am
experienc
that
inner
calm
to
which
susan
origin
refer
inner
calm
is
not
boredom
a
far
a
the
arena
in
gener
be
bore

been
that
way
all
season

to
a
lot
of
new

who
just
dont
have
the
same
spirit
and
knowledg
a
longtim
fan
at
last
tuesday

overheard
a
man
express
surpris
that
a
goaltend
can
get
an
assist
anyon
who
follow
sport
with
regular
know
that
anyth
can
happen
at
ani
time
im
confid
in
the
pen
but
im
also
not
stupid
enough
to
think
for
one
minut
that
it
imposs
for
new
jersey
to
blow
them
out
of
thi
seri
i
doubt
that
will
happen
but
it
possibl
bore

in
the
least
forgot
what
excit
is
like
live
through
that
amaz
streak
