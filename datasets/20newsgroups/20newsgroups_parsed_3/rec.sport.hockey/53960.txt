re
thi
year
biggest
and
worst
opinion
in
articl
peterrclarkjr
write
so
in
other
word
if
roussel
shut
out
the
shark
and
soderstrom
shut
out
the
penguin
that
immateri
becaus
it
wa
the
coach
decis
come
on
joe
think
about
what
your
say
who
they
play
is
veri
signific
whi
they
play
them
is
what
irrelev
a
low
gaa
against
good
team
is
better
than
a
low
gaa
against
bad
team
in
the
context
of
compar
two
goaltend
a
low
gaa
is
better
then
a
higher
gaa
a
low
gaa
against
good
team
is
much
much
better
than
a
higher
gaa
against
bad
team
in
the
context
of
compar
two
goaltend
let
start
over
im
not
argu
about
who
is
the
better
goaltend
id
take
soderstrom
right
now
what
i
am
say
is
that
roussel
can
be
a
netmind
the
gaa
differ
is
le
than
half
a
goal
per
game
le
than
that
after
last
night
their
save
percentag
are
close
and
their
record
are
similar
and
with
that
i
just
dont
see
how
you
can
label
roussel
a
the
most
disappoint
player
on
the
flyer
thi
season
you
say
soderstrom
play
against
better
competit
that
may
veri
well
be
but
there
is
no
way
of
know
how
roussel
would
have
perform
in
those
game
besid
against
the
better
score
team
like
pittsburgh
the
defens
is
more
key
up
than
they
are
against
san
jose
the
same
for
roussel
in
the
ranger
game
two
real
score
chanc
one
he
made
a
great
play
the
other
he
wa
save
by
a
mistak
from
the
other
player
if
you
were
judg
roussel
on
that
game
alon
you
have
veri
littl
to
go
by
but
im
not
just
judg
roussel
on
that
game
alon
ive
seen
him
play
for
the
past
two
season
in
philli
and
befor
that
in
hershey
it
just
my
opinion
but
i
think
he
got
what
it
take
of
cours
i
thought
that
about
mark
laforest
too
but
i
never
did
about
wendel
young
so
im
bat
in
judg
hershey
talent
sinc
the
hextallera
a
for
the
ranger
game
you
can
say
he
wa
save
by
a
mistak
by
the
offens
player
if
you
like
but
rou
had
hi
leg
in
posit
to
make
the
save
if
he
didnt
it
wouldnt
have
matter
if
the
ranger
player
didnt
get
the
puck
up
or
not
it
would
have
been
a
goal
on
a
breakaway
that
what
the
goali
want
to
do
take
away
a
much
a
possibl
and
forc
the
shooter
to
beat
him
but
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
tie
against
the
hab
you
saw
a
goali
stand
on
hi
head
to
get
that
shutout
that
wa
a
goali
in
action
roussel
doesnt
have
a
game
like
that
in
him
i
seem
to
rememb
roussel
do
an
excel
job
against
pittsurgh
on
open
night
to
give
the
flyer
a
tie
against
the
twotim
defend
champ
and
not
to
take
anyth
away
from
soderstrom
becaus
he
wa
senat
in
that
game
again
the
hab
but
you
cant
tell
me
that
a
montreal
player
had
an
open
net
to
shoot
at
some
point
dure
that
game
and
just
flat
out
miss
it
mistak
both
on
offens
and
defens
are
part
of
the
game
or
there
never
be
shutout
anyway
im
happi
the
flyer
have
both
soderstrom
and
roussel
and
im
not
go
to
argu
about
it
anymor
besid
with
the
current
game
win
streak
and
expect
soar
for
next
year
i
dont
want
to
piss
you
off
to
the
point
that
you
dont
sell
me
ani
ticket
