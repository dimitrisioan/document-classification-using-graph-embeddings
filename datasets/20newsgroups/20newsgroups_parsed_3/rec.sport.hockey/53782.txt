with
great
thank
to

for
save
and
send
it
rob
zettler
season
th
acquir
from
minnesota

draft
grade
cc
zettler
gave
the
shark
everi
bit
he
got
thi
year
unfortun
thi
still
wasnt
enough
to
make
him
ani
more
than
a
margin
nhler
if
that
he
work
hard
for
sure
but
is
no
better
than
averag
on
defens
and
is
prone
to
costli
penalti
and
defens
lap
at
time
while
be
basic
an
offens
zero
goal
and
assist
in
game
he
would
be
hardpress
to
make
the
team
next
year
david
william
season
nd
acquir
free
agent
from
new
jersey
grade
cc
imo
william
wa
the
most
valuabl
defenseman
for
the
shark
in
play
a
combin
of
good
offens
goal
and
assist
in
game
and
good
defens
but
he
play
the
first
part
of
thi
season
in
kansa
citi
wa
good
neither
offens
nor
defens
thi
year
it
then
appear
that
wa
a
fluke
although
he
improv
toward
the
end
of
the
season
he
wa
prone
to
be
out
of
posit
defens
and
did
not
demonstr
the
playmak
skill
that
made
him
the
team
lead
scorer
among
defensemen
last
year
he
would
also
be
hardpress
to
make
the
team
next
year
jayson
more
season
nd
acquir
from
montreal
in
expans
draft
grade
b
after
be
tout
a
the
team
top
defens
prospect
in
train
camp
befor
more
had
a
rather
disappoint
a
he
wa
not
particularli
good
defens
and
had
just
point
in
game
he
then
proceed
to
improv
hi
game
massiv
thi
season
becom
the
team
most
reliabl
defenseman
whom
the
team
can
count
on
night
in
and
night
out
to
play
steadi
defens
and
provid
occasion
but
onli
occasion
offens
flash
offens
he
wa
even
more
disappoint
than
last
year
point
in
game
but
hi
defens
improv
tremend
he
is
probabl
best
a
the
defens
part
of
a
defens
combin
with
an
offens
defenseman
neil
wilkinson
season
th
acquir
from
minnesota
in
dispers
draft
grade
b
wilkinson
wa
probabl
the
team
top
defens
defenseman
in
howev
partial
becaus
of
injuri
he
wa
not
the
same
thi
year
a
he
miss
game
total
due
to
nag
knee
and
back
injuri
and
seem
to
be
slow
even
when
play
he
then
had
often
to
be
save
by
hi
defens
partner
that
is
if
they
are
there
at
all
but
he
also
had
some
solid
game
and
if
he
can
be
complet
healthi
he
can
still
be

a
at

ozolinsh
wa
well
on
track
to

the

mvp
a
seriou

injuri
in
that
game
though
forc
him
to
miss
the
rest
of
the
season
game
but
he
still
finish
a
the
team
top
scorer
among
defensemen
point
which
of
cours
tell
more
about
the
lack
of
offens
the
shark
had
from
their
defensemen
but
it
also
tell
of
ozolinsh
abil
at
the
time
he
wa
play
veri
good
defens
along
with
excel
offens
he
wa
still
suscept
to
socal
rooki
mistak
but
wa
probabl
the
defenseman
who
made
the
least
of
them
on
the
team
rooki
or
veteran
if
he
can
come
