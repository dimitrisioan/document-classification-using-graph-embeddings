ronni
franci
ha
had
a
much
better
season
than
jaromir
jagr
thi
is
not
to
take
anyth
away
from
jaro
who
had
a
decent
year
although
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
expect
of
some
bowman
tend
to
overplay
franci
at
time
becaus
he
is
a
bowmanstyl
player
he
play
hard
at
all
time
doesnt
disregard
hi
defens
respons
and
is
a
good
leader
bowman
reward
him
be
increas
hi
ice

jagr
can
be
veri
arrog
and
juvenil
and
display
a
me

thi
rub
bowman
the
wrong
way
and
caus
him
to
lose
some
ice

throughout
the
year
franci
consist
reciev
more
ice
time
than
jagr
althouhg
i
have
never
seen
stat
on
thi
subject
i
am
pretti
sure
that
jagr
had
more
point
per
minut
play
that
franci
when
you
add
to
that
jagr
better
rate
i
think
it
becom
evid
that
jagr
had
a
better
season
not
that
franci
had
a
bad
one
actual
what
i
think
ha
becom
more
evid
is
that
you
are
determin
to
flaunt
your
ignor
at
all
cost
jagr
did
not
have
a
better
season
than
franci
to
suggest
otherwis
is
an
insult
to
those
with
a
modicum
of
hockey
knowledg
save
your
almost
maniac
devot
to
the
almighti
plusminu
it
is
the
most
mislead
hockey
stat
avail
until
the
nhl
publish
a
more
use
quantifi
statist
includ
ice
time
per
game
and
some
measur
of
it
qualiti
ie
is
the
player
put
out
in
key
situat
like
protect
a
lead
late
in
the
game
is
he
match
up
against
the
other
team
top
one
or
two
line
shorthand
etc
i
would
much
rather
see
the
disappear
altogeth
instead
of
have
it
dubiou
merit
trumpet
by
those
with
littl
understand
of
it
implic
thank
you
for
post
thi
a
the
person
who
first
brought
up
the
fact
that
jagr
ha
a
much
higher
than
franci
i
can
assur
you
that
i
brought
it
up
a
an
exampl
of
the
absurd
of
comparison
even
on
the
same
team
i
never
ever
thought
that
anyon
would
argu
that
jagr
higher
actual
reflect
better
twoway
play
in
my
opinion
franciss
low
is
pure
a
result
of
him
be
ask
to
play
against
oppon
top
scorer
at
all
time
the
fact
that
he
can
chip
in
point
while
neutral
the
other
team
top
center
is
a
testament
to
how
valuabl
he
is
even
if
hi
suffer
on
the
other
hand
jagr
for
how
big
fast
and
skill
he
is
cant
even
get
point
no
matter
how
inflat
hi
is
by
the
way
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
jagr
he
may
be
a
lazi
floater
but
he
turn
it
on
at
exactli
the
right
time
like
overtim
of
playoff
game
