when
the
pen
got
mario
grant
there
wa
big
public
etc
etc
and
interest
wa
immedi
gener
gretzki
did
the
same
thing
for
la
howev
imnsho
neither
team
would
have
seen
a
mark
improv
in
attend
if
the
team
record
did
not
improv
in
the
year
befor
lemieux
came
pittsburgh
finish
with
point
follow
hi
arriv
the
pen
finish
with
and
point
with
a
coupl
of
stanley
cup
thrown
in
it
wa
at
thi
point
the
pen
attend
wa
near
capac
out
of
sellout
yet
they
hadnt
made
the
playoff
sinc
how
do
you
explain
a
th
place
team
break
attend
record
when
they
havent
been
to
the
playoff
in
year
mario
lemieux
is
the
explan
imho
you
could
make
a
case
that
the
expect
of
an
improv
team
that
would
make
the
playoff
is
the
reason
funni
you
should
mention
itthi
is
exactli
the
case
i
wa
go
to
make
but
i
think
the
reason
is
lemieux
had
a
point
season
and
wa
the
first
nongretzki
to
win
the
hart
and
ross
sinc
peopl
turn
out
to
watch
him
play
i
will
grant
that
a
star
like
mario
will
draw
fan
even
if
the
team
suck
but
thi
is
short
term
onli
i
still
do
not
think
the
attend
increas
will
last
unless
the
team
is
a
winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkick
one
pittsburgh
wa
still
get
better
so
peopl
continu
to
support
them
if
they
suddenli
drop
to
say
point
youd
have
knee
surgeri
for
some
of
the
peopl
jump
off
the
bandwagon
also
the
follow
year
the
pen
had
point
not
ok
my
number
came
from
the
nhl
guid
and
record
book
they
made
the
transact
to
tri
and
build
a
winner
around
mario
that
is
true
but
the
improv
in
attend
came
befor
they
start
do
thi
coffey
late
in
and
befor
they
even
had
a
playoff
bound
team
a
doubl
of
attend
occur
in
from
the
previou
year
an
increas
from
point
to
point
is
not
go
to
do
that
the
arriv
of
mario
lemieux
is
what
did
it
you
can
give
the
credit
to
mario
sinc
he
deserv
it
but
my
point
is
that
it
wasnt
mario
himself
but
it
wa
the
expect
of
thing
to
come
ie
a
win
team
that
he
creat
by
be
the
next
great
hockey
superstar
and
befor
anybodi
jump
in
and
say
im
nitpick
and
minc
word
go
back
and
read
from
where
thi
thread
start
it
might
help
to
think
about
what
would
go
through
a
fan
mind
who
suddenli
found
an
interest
in
mario
and
the
pen
wa
it
gee
mario
lemieux
is
amaz
ill
go
watch
him
play
or
wa
it
gee
now
weve
got
a
kick
as
guy
on
our
side
ill
go
watch
him
play
i
think
it
wa
the
latter
similar
thing
happen
in
la
befor
gretzki
arriv
about
per
game
after
constant
sellout
they
are
still
sell
out
everi
game
despit
show
littl
or
no
improv
sinc
gretzki
first
year
there
how
do
you
explain
it
peopl
are
go
to
see
gretzki
they
certainli
arent
go
to
see
a
winner
they
havent
got
a
winner
theyv
had
much
better
team
in
their
past
histori
than
they
current
have
yet
they
didnt
draw
a
well
then
i
dont
think
thi
is
accur
the
ticket
sell
but
peopl
dont
go
to
the
game
i
think
thi
thread
ha
alreadi
been
discussedseason
ticket
holder
in
la
dont
alway
use
their
ticket
so
in
effect
after
the
king
initi
success
follow
gretzki
arriv
to
point
same
sourc
and
correspond
attend
jump
there
ha
been
an
effect
drop
in
attend
even
though
ticket
sale
may
not
have
chang
much
whether
or
not
the
king
are
a
winner
is
debat
i
claim
that
sinc
gretzki
arriv
they
have
at
the
veri
least
been
competitivei
also
claim
that
mcnall
ha
made
a
stupid
move
in
tri
to
reassembl
the
oiler
dynastybut
that
anoth
stori
and
includ
onli
becaus
i
dont
like
mcnall
anyway
mcnall
did
do
some
heavi
market
around
gretzki
and
that
undoubtedli
wa
also
respons
for
the
attend
and
merchandis
sale
etc
but
a
i
said
when
the
king
have
been
in
there
littl
tailspin
over
the
past
coupl
of
year
there
have
been
empti
seat
at
the
forum
even
if
the
ticket
were
sold
i
think
in
the
case
of
a
lemieux
or
gretzki
the
player
can
transcend
win
a
the
major
draw
power
for
the
short
term
imo
although
i
think
that
it
inevit
that
the
team
will
improv
with
a
player
such
a
lemieux
or
gretzki
simpli
becaus
they
make
peopl
around
them
better
but
win
sure
a
hell
help
well
at
least
we
are
in
full
agreement
here
thi
doe
not
make
roger
point
ani
more
valid
but
the
jet
arent
so
are
you
say
roger
ha
ever
had
a
valid
point
couldnt
resist
get
a
huge
jump
in
product
yet
they
are
get
a
huge
jump
in
attend
thi
is
due
to
the
emerg
of
teemu
selann
they
have
the
th
best
record
in
hockey
it
sure
a
hell
isnt
becaus
they
are
win
ye
but
they
are
do
no
wors
than
last
year
i
think
the
same
type
of
reason
i
appli
to
a
new
pittsburgh
fan
appli
to
all
the
extra
peopl
show
up
at
winnipeg
game
it
difficult
to
predict
but
do
you
think
that
if
the
jet
miss
the
playoff
next
season
that
in
the
year
after
they
will
maintain
their
attend
level
i
serious
doubt
it
becaus
in
that
case
the
expect
of
an
improv
team
would
be
gone
with
or
without
selann
i
did
provid
the
exampl
of
rocket
ismail
and
the
toronto
argonaut
of
the
cfldid
you
leav
it
out
becaus
you
dont
know
much
about
the
cfl
if
that
the
case
then
fair
enough
but
if
it
isnt
the
case
then
im
curiou
to
hear
your
explan
