anyon
els
see
thi
game
last
night
just
like
a
playoff
game
lot
of
hittingbut
i
wa
disappoint
by
the
video
goal
judg
on
all

joe
murphi
goal
shouldnt
have
count
it
didnt
go
in
net
and
accord
to
the
tsn
broadcast
the
video
goal
judg
said
that
he
saw
the
water
bottl
on
top
of
the
cage
move
so
he
assum
the
puck
went
in
thi
is
terriblehop
crap
like
thi
doesnt
occur
in
the
playoff
the
game
would
have
end
in
tie

the
presumpt
would
be
to
find
conclus
evid
that
the
puck
did
not
go
in
the
netfrom
the
replay
i
say
even
from
the
rear
the
evid
wasnt
conclus
that
the
puck
wa
in
or
outin
