thi
and
he
had
a
substanci
better
actual
what
i
think
ha
becom
more
evid
is
that
you
are
determin
to
flaunt
your
ignor
at
all
cost
jagr
did
not
have
a
better
season
than
franci
to
suggest
otherwis
is
an
insult
to
those
with
a
modicum
of
hockey
knowledg
save
your
almost
maniac
devot
to
the

it
is
the
most
mislead
hockey
stat
avail
until
the
nhl
publish
a
more
use
quantifi
statist
includ
ice
time
per
game
and
some
measur
of
it
qualiti
ie
is
the
player
put
out
in
key
situat
like
protect
a
lead
late
in
the
game
is
he
match
up
against
the
other
team
top
one
or
two

i
would
much
rather
see
the
disappear
altogeth
instead
of
have
it
dubiou
merit
trumpet
by
those
with
littl
understand
of
it
implic
is
a
use
statist
if
a
player
is
on
the
ice
when
hi
team
score
a
lot
of
goal
and
onli
allow
a
few
goal
he
must
be
do
someth
right
it
is
especi
use
to
compar
between
teammat
a
they
play
for
the
same
team
and
should
have
roughli
similar
rate
if
they
are
equal
good
player
it
can
be
adjust
with
vari
degre
of
success
to
compar
between
player
on
differ
team
i
agre
it
would
be
nice
for
the
nhl
to
keep
more
statist
but
how
use
are
the
one
that
you
suggest
total
ice
time
would
be
veri
use
it
is
a
miss
stat
in
jagr
v
franci
argument
from
befor
somehow
measur
the
qualiti
of
ice
time
a
you
suggest
would
be
useless
it
would
be
a
better
stat
for
evalu
coach
ie
are
the
player
given
qualiti
ice
time
actual
their
talent
one
a
veri
good
player
could
be
given
low
amount
of
qualiti
ice
time
becaus
of
team
depth
or
a
stupid
coach
who
doesnt
recogn
hi
talent
and
a
veri
bad
player
could
be
given
lot
of
qualiti
ice
time
becaus
of
a
lack
of
team
depth
or
a
stupid
coach
that
think
he
is
an
effect
player
thi
stat
would
be
much
more
flaw
than
and
almost
no
conclus
could
be
drawn
regard
player
talent
is
a
use
stat
it
is
quit
use
in
evalu
player
talent
you
are
the
one
display
ignor
becaus
of
your
unwilling
to
see
that
be
on
the
ice
when

not
when
