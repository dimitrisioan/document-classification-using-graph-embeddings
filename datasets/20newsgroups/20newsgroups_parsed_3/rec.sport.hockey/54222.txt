grade
i
b
it
is
way
too
earli
to
tell
about
ahola
who
wa
acquir
probabl
becaus
the
penguin
figur
that
they
would
lose
him
in
the
expans
draft
ahola
had
onli
play
game
thi
season
i
think
it
actual
le
the
san
jose
mercuri
news
may
be
in
err
here
of
them
with
the
shark
in
the
game
he
ha
play
he
appear
quit
solid
defens
although
he
hasnt
been
spectacular
and
hi
offens
isnt
anyth
to
write
home
about
point
it
even
possibl
that
the
trade
may
be
for
futur
consider
which
turn
out
to
be
peter
ahola
doug
wilson
season
th
acquir
trade
with
chicago
for
rw
kerri
toporowski
and
nd
round
pick
in
entri
draft
grade
i
b
i
have
often
been
accus
of
overli
down
on
wilson
i
may
have
had
too
high
expect
for
him
but
hi
leg
knee
et
al
are
give
out
nevertheless
when
he
wa
play
he
exhibit
a
strong
shoot
and
playmak
abil
even
if
he
ha
lost
a
step
on
defens
which
unfortun
he
demonstr
thi
year
a
well
a
at
time
he
wa
slow
to
catch
the
oppon
forward
and
hi
offens
output
wa
onli
good
enough
for
nd
place
on
the
team
point
in
game
but
next
year
which
may
be
wilson
last
if
he
can
stay
healthi
he
can
still
be
a
contributor
dean
kolstad
season
nd
acquir
from
minnesota
in
dispers
draft
grade
i
cd
it
probabl
somewhat
unfair
for
me
to
judg
kolstad
on
just
a
hand
of
game
forget
exact
number
but
no
more
than
but
at
age
he
quickli
run
out
of
time
if
he
want
to
make
it
to
the
nhl
in
those
game
he
did
not
impress
anyon
after
gener
shot
in
the
first
period
of
the
first
game
he
play
he
score
just
point
in
hi
tenur
up
here
with
the
shark
and
wa
even
le
impress
defens
a
he
appear
awkward
with
hi
movement
and
wa
prone
to
giveaway
he
need
to
make
a
leap
in
hi
level
of
perform
to
have
ani
chanc
of
make

season
nd
acquir

draft
grade
i
macleod
wa
on
the
roster
a
lot
longer
than
kolstad
but
it
appear
to
my
memori
that
he
play
le
than
kolstad
becaus
the
shark
were
reluct
to
use
him
but
were
even
more
reluct
to
send
him
to
the
minor
figur
that
he
wouldnt
clear
waiver
in
fact
he
ha
play
the
past
week
with
kansa
citi
but
is
still
technic
there
on
a
rehabilit

a
rehab

that
will
includ
him

in
the
turner
cup
playoff
sinc
he
ha
play
so
littl
i
cant
even
give
a
tent
grade
on
him

howev
hi
size
lb
is
of
concern
and
soon
after
he
began
to
shine

did
team
begin
to
push
him
around
physic
on
both
side
of
the
ice
although
he
had

approach

to

he
probabl
need

the
onli
notabl

that
