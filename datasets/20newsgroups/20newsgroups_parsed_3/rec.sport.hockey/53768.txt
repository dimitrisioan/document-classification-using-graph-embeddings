delet
the

to
the
point
that

that
is
it
is
the

that
are
what
make
the

great

not
the
peopl

a

recal
the
author
of

origin
articl
that
start
the

claim
that
he
dislik
the
chang
of

for

varieti
of

roger
on
one
front
you
flame
him
rather
sever
on
the
ground
that
hi
wa
a
jingoist
rant
but
you
also
support
the
namechang
on
the
ground
that
the
current
name
are
inappropri
becaus
of
the
individu
they
repres
fwiw
i
do
not
think
the
flame
wa
warrant
nor
do
i
think
you
enhanc
what
credibl
you
have
with
it
at
all
just
an
observ
howev
that
asid
the
real
question
is
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
chang
the
name
base
on
the
reason
given
for
it
make
it
easier
for
the
casual
fan
or
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
uniqu
division
name
base
on
individu
who
do
deserv
the
honour
imo
the
latter
is
a
nice
and
uniqu
touch
that
differ
from
other
sport
in
addit
i
do
not
think
that
chang
division
name
will
have
an
effect
on
the
number
of
peopl
that
are
interest
in
hockey
so
it
a
pointless
exercis
anyway
if
the
current
name
are
inappropri
then
that
is
a
separ
issu
not
central
to
the
origin
articl
someth
to
consid
addit
is
whether
or
not
player
like
orr
who
contribut
to
the
glori
of
the
sport
would
have
been
abl
to
do
