olchowi
write
wayn
made
hi
own
bedchoos
mcnall
over
sather
and
hockey
destinyh
should
sleep
in
it
instead
of
whine
ego
got
absolut
nonsens
the
decis
that
wa
made
wa
pocklington
he
chose
mill
over
gretzki
if
gretzki
wasnt
upset
about
not
be
abl
to
win
a
cup
in
la
then
i
submit
that
he
wasnt
worth
the
mill
the
best
of
himh
thought
the
support
cast
in
edmonton
didnt
matterthat
he
wa
the
show
himself
how
do
you
know
what
he
think
or
thought
the
onli
thought
that
i
can
see
that
you
have
reveal
is
your
own
you
dont
like
gretzki
big
deal
now
my
onli
complaint
about
lemieux
is
that
he
dive
too
much
but
last
year
patrick
convinc
him
twice
to
accept
bowman
and
hockey
destini
rather
than
hi
ego
the
real
purpos
of
dive
is
not
mere
an
attempt
to
draw
a
penalti
what
the
player
is
tri
to
do
is
make
the
checker
keep
their
distanc
so
the
ref
wont
be
fool
i
cant
imagin
whi
anyon
would
expect
someon
like
lemieux
to
chang
hi
game
whi
dont
you
pick
on
dimension
overr
type
like
hull
and
