write
if
espn
piss
you
off
call
them
they
do
respond
to
call
last
night
i
call
when
they
said
they
were
cut
to
basebal
and
we
couldnt
see
the
suddendeath
overtim
for
the
buffalo
game
appar
they
receiv
enough
call
so
they
wait
for
the
overtim
to
finish
befor
cut
away
their
phone
number
is
susan
dart
well
i
think
whenev
espn
cover
the
game
they
do
a
wonder
job
but
what
i
dont
understand
is
that
they
cut
the
ot
just
show
some
stupid
basebal
news
which
is
not
import
at
all
then
i
wait
for
the
score
to
comeon
sportscent
but
they
talk
about
basebal
basketbal
and
footbal
then
they
show
penguin
highlight
and
went
back
to
stupid
basketbal
final
they
show
a
highlight
of
the
ot
goal
but
that
wa
like
sec
i
think
they
should
give
more
attent
to
nhl
dure
the
playoff
then
talk
about
bore
basketbal
game
i
guess
it
is
nhl
fault
too
for
leav
espn
hope
thing
improv
by
next
season
