now
what
if
the
two
team
were
merg
thi
ha
been
propos
in
tamper
with
ilv
lynx
and
tappara
axe
the
fan
wouldnt
take
it
they
rather
see
their
team
out
of
the
playoff
most
of
the
time
or
even
releg
than
merg
it
not
that
difficult
to
understand
it
just
like
here
in
helsinki
you
grow
up
be
either
a
jokerit
or
hifk
fan
the
other
team
is
the
last
team
in
the
world
you
would
support
im
not
talk
about
hate

about
extrem

helsingfor
ifk
have
been

but
fan
onli
start
take
hockey
serious
in
the
s
so
i
think
your
exager
here
howev
it
been
prove
that
both
fan
group
can
cheer
the
same
team
that
the
finnish
nation
team
mayb
that
how
you
could
set
up
a
huge
franchis
in
finland
no
one
ha
ever
said
that
the
team
must
be
call
after
one
citi
or
play
all
it
game
on
one
arena
just
one
team
finland
and
team
sweden
in
the
nhl
just
wouldnt
make
ani
sens
we
have
way
more
talent
than
th
of
the
total
of
north
american
talent
after
a
coupl
of
season
you
would
never
see
the
cup
go
anywher
outsid
the
nordic
presum
that
our
team
would
have
the
advantag
in
draft
local
talent
a
proopos
that
a
rather
bold
claim
in
the
light
of
how
success
the
canadian
american
olymp
team
have
been
and
theyv
had
to
play
accord
to
our
set
of
rule
and
on
intern
ice
the
olymp
team
contain
about
a
much
talent
a
your
averag

had
eric
lindro
sean
burk
joe
juneau
and
chri
konto
anoth
four

steve

ted
donato
joe
sacco
and
bill

have
been
rdth

player
in
the
nhl
while
robb
stauber
ha
done
well
for
the
king
in
goal
noth
more
in
fact
im
sure
that
an
allstar
team
assembl
from
the
best
finnish
leagu
team
would
do
no
better
in
the
nhl
than
hartford
or
tampa
bay
current
are
do
but
what
happen
if

one

no

but
i
have
my
doubt
about
the
homebas
finnish
player
the
nation
team
did
well
in
the
canada
cup
and
world
championship
larg
due
to
the
effort
of
marku
ketter
the
goali
or
the
player
list
abov
and
luck
there
presum
a
lot
of
decent
player
in
finland
that
wouldnt
be
superstar
at
the
highest
level
but
still
valuabl
role
player
howev
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
sweden
is
easier
to
judg
becaus
they
have
more
player
in
north
america
their
point
total
player
is
seven
more
than
ottawa
top
player
combin
if
we
estim
there
are
six
more
nhl
regular
back
home
in
sweden
an
allswedish
team
would
assembl
about
skill
point
deduct
some
point
from
pittsburgh
ny
ranger
and
other
team
that
reli
on
swedish
player
the
swedish
team
would
finish
in
sixth
place
about
a
high
a
boston
vancouv
calgari
and
montreal
on
paper
so
the
dynasti
talk
isnt
complet
unfound
here
an
allfinnishallswedish
team
might
have
an
advantag
becaus
the
player
would
be
play
at
home
half
of
the
time
wont
have
to
adapt
to
a
foreign
countri
and
a
foreign
languag
and
presum
play
the
wideopen
european
variant
of
hockey
rather
than
have
to
learn
the
north
american
check
game
howev
if
free
agenc
becom
a
factor
the
top
scandinavian
player
still
might
end
up
play
for
largemarket
team
after
a
coupl
of

the
same
way
edmonton

crumbl
in
the
late
s
some
fring
player
like
will
be
draft
by

might
be
a
bit
unfair
after
all
id
settl
for

prohibit
all

team
from

american
dure
the
first
two
round
but
allow
them
to
keep
