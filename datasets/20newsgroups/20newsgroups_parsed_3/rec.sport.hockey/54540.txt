a
for
the
pick
ottawa
pick
which
mean
it
is
almost
that
alexand
daigl
will
go
hell
either
stay
or
be
trade
in
montreal
or
quebec
i
dunno
about
hat
i
have
friend
up
there
on
geni
who
are
now
say
that
ottawa
gone
soft
on
daigl
and
is
think
hard
about
pronger
daigl
ha
shown
an
attitud
the
latter
part
of
thi
season
mani
folk
havnet
like
and

that
a
lot
of
teh
draft
st
stuff
come
from
the
assumpt
hell
be
trade
to
quebec
for
lot
of
prospect
it
not
clear
that
quebec
would
realli
be
will
to
pay
a
lot
for
him
given
hi
current
statu
he
still
first
round
but
i
dont
consid
him
a
first
pick
lock
by
ani
mean
at

point
it
also
possibl
that

to
bring
down
hi
sign
price
sinc
daigl
ha
been
take
some
lindro
lesson
dure
tho
suspens
imo
i
would
take
kariya
he
should
alot
of
leadership
in
the
ncaa
and
so
far
in
the
world
championship
daigl
didnt
show
thi
for
hi
junior
team
san
jose

then
get
kariya
no
kariya

a
veri
simpl
reason

avail
that
can
make
an
immedi
impact
san
jose
seem
to
be
lean
heavili
toward
niedermay
for
that
reason
kariya
