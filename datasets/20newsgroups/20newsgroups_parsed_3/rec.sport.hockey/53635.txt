from

almost
all
the

read
the

net
worth
for
one
view
of
what
smyth

also
isnt
the
point
of
profession
hockey
to
make
money
for
all
those
involv
which
would
includ
the
player
what
i
think
you
might
be
say
is
that
the
player
have
not
made
a
much
money
a
should
have
been
their
due
and
it
is
the
player
that
are
what
make
the
game
great
not
the
peopl
who
put
them
on
the
ice
so
name
divis
after
manag
peopl
rather

is
ad
insult

i
think
what
roger
wa
say
and
i
said
it
previous
too
is
that
these
are
not
the
