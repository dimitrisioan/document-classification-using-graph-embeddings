european
expans
and
our
fcked
system
everyon
keep
talk
about
european
expans
by
think
wish
thought
but
be
total
off
the
ball
the
leagu
format
we
use
here
is
incompat
with
that
in
europ
for
those
that
dont
know
the
best
team
from
lower
divis
get
promot
and
the
worst
get
demot
would
european
fan
put
up
with
our
if
youv
paid
you
can
play
attitud
how
long
would
they
support
team
that
are
run
on
rangerbas
corpor
think
i
use
the
term
lightli
we
dont
need
a
good
product
becaus
these
duffus
in
nyc
would
fill
the
arena
for
ottawa
record
everi
year
haha
sorri
had
ta
say
it
if
hockey
and
other
pro
sport
had
a
similar
system
to
europ
mayb
team
like
the
ranger
would
be
forc
to
compet
or
get
demot
the
fourth
divis
wed
have
mani
more
teamscentr
that
arent
a
big
like
halifax
or
adirondackok
so
halifax
isnt
a
good
exampl
would
eventu
get
promot
and
everi
team
would
be
somewhat
competet
within
it
own
divis
unlik
ottawa
sj
edmonton
etc
fan
would
eventu
get
reward
for
their
loyalti
or
penal
for
their
neglect
and
the
leagu
would
be
more
interest
and
dynam
everi
year
becaus
of
the
influx
of
newli
promot
team
and
the
halifax
citadel
win
the
stanley
cupi
can
dream
cant
i
look
at
british
or
ani
european
soccer
a
an
exampl
they
never
have
fan
problem
just
someon
who
think
our
system
realli
suck
barfli
feel
free
to
flame
me
my
account
end
todayhahahaha
