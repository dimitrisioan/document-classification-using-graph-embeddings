a
product
of

gmmurray
ha
made
a
coupl
of
decent

about
it
that
would
hardli
rank
him
a
the
best
gm
there
are
mani
team
in
the
nhl
who
have
taken
a
like
to
russian
player
the
whole
russian
strategi
is
not
specif
to
detroit
or
to
devellano
who
wa
gm
befor
murray
what
the
previou
gm
also
did
wa
to
trade
away
sever
player
who
have
gone
on
to
do
well
with
other
team
most
notabl
in
my
memori
murray
craven
who
had
a
few
veri
good
year
with
philli
after
leav
here
also
it
not
the
volum
of
trade
that
will
necessarili
improv
a
team
but
the
qualiti
of
them
trade
adam
oat
for
berni
federko
wa
just
plain
stupid
even
if
federko
use
to
be
a
great
player
at
one
time
most
of
murray
trade
have
work
significantli
to
the
wing
advantag
with
those
that
didnt
be
sour
mainli
by
injuri
to
the
player
involv
such
a
troy
crowder
who
suffer
back
problem
from
which
he
never
realli
recov
devallano
went
earlier
and
more
extens
to
the
russian
strategi
than
anyon
elseand
wa
the
first
gm
to
wast
high
draft
choic
on
young
russiansdevallano
would
still
be
gm
but
he
succomb
to
demer
plead
to
make
the
oatesfederko
et
al
tradewhich
is
the
deal
that
seal
hi
fate
murray
ha
made
some
decent
tradesno
doubtbut
these
are
more
due
to
the
stupid
or
cheap
of
other
team
than
brillianc
on
hi
partwashington
wa
too
cheap
to
pay
ciccarelli
so
they
essenti
gave
him
awayand
carson
wa
realli
a
big
anchor
to
the
team
and
he
wa
abl
to
sucker
a
rooki
gm
to
give
him
paul
coffey
for
deadweight
if
detroit
still
fail
thi
year
becaus
he
wa
one
defenseman
short
then
he
will
have
wast
an
opportun
becaus
manson
wa
avail
and
he
wa
unabl
to
pull
the
trigger
it
is
hi
judgement
that
he
ha
enough
with
what
he
