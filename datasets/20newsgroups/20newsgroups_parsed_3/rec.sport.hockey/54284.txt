write
i
am
an
ulf
and
pgh
fan
and
what
piss
me
off
about
the
whole
adam
graf
ulf
samuesson
debat
is
that
ulf
play
hardhit
hockey
noth
wrong
with
that
while
graf
doe
what
he
doe
when
the
onli
way
to
win
a
game
is
to
intent
hurt
someon
which
bite
jeesu
i
never
thought
id
see
the
day
when
i
defend
a
ranger
you
obvious
dont
watch
much
hockey
if
you
think
that
graf
is
a
goon
he
is
one
of
the
hardest
work
ranger
check
that
the
hardest
work
ranger
he
had
goal
thi
year
not
bad
for
a
check
type
of
player
and
show
up
for
everi
singl
game
thi
season
unlik
that
stiff
messier
he
is
fearless
and
throw
clean
check
he
will
also
stand
up
to
someon
after
he
hit
them
not
like
that
pussi
oaf
exactli
my
point
if
youd
watch
game
more
close
youd
see
a
lot
of
goon
go
after
him
ulf
is
one
of
the
main
reason
whi
le
physic
player
for
pgh
are
left
alon
ulf
play
rough
hockey
but
onli
when
other
player
are
put
the
rush
on
mario
or
jagr
if
you
want
to
say
anyon
on
the
penguin
is
a
cheap
shot
or
a
goon
say
it
jen
or
caufield
dontsland
a
good
defenseman
becaus
your
favorit
player
cant
beat
the
pen
even
when
they
take
dive
like
gartner
to
tri
for
the
cheap
penalti
a
for
hi
slash
of
lemieux
fine
it
wa
a
cheap
shot
it
is
the
except
not
the
rule
i
bet
you
think
mike
gartner
is
a
goon
becaus
of
the
time
that
he
slash
the
hell
out
of
oaf
arm
last
year
right
after
all
he
did
get
a
suspens
for
it
hey
that
fine
if
a
player
doe
someth
stupid
he
should
be
penal
includ
ulf
or
mario
your
not
like
to
see
that
happen
or
anyon
els
for
that
matter
it
pointless
to
say
ani
one
person

a
cheapshot
