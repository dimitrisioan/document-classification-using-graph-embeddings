well
well
they
dont
like
our
defend
mainli
lumm
and
numminen
about
is
correct
for
numminen
and
lumm
rteemu
selann
compar
to
kurri
selann
point
are
too
high
let
make
it
or
no
kurri
point
are
too
low
for
kurri
and
for
selnn
well
in
the
canada
cup
and
world
championship
larg
due
to
the
effort
of
marku
ketter
the
goali
or
the
player
list
abov
and
luck
there
presum
a
lot
of
decent
player
in
finland
that
wouldnt
be
superstar
at
the
highest
level
but
still
valuabl
role
player
howev
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
wow
now
it
look
like
you
dont
like
our
player
what
about
guy
like
nieminen
jutila
riihijarvi
varvio
laukkanen
makela
keskinen
and
even
if
he
is
age
ruotsalainen
the
main
differ
between
finnish
and
north
american
player
is
that
our
player
tend
to
be
better
in
the
larger
rink
the
canadian
defend
are
usual
slower
that
defend
in
europ
and
i
think
that
there
wa
more
in
our
success
than
ketter
and
luck
though
they
help
i
think
that
the
main
reason
wa
that
the
team
work
well
togeth
that
true
game
is
so
differ
here
in
europ
compar
to
nhl
northam
rican
are
better
in
small
rink
and
european
in
larg
rink
an
averag
european
player
from
sweden
finland
russian
or
tsechslovakia
is
a
better
skater
and
puckhandl
than
hi
nhl
colleagu
especi
defend
in
nhl
are
mainli
slow
and
clumsi
selnn
ha
also
said
that
in
the
finnish
smleagu
game
is
more
base
on
skill
than
in
nhl
in
finland
he
couldnt
get
so
mani
breakaway
becaus
defend
here
are
an
averag
much
better
skater
than
in
nhl
also
alpo
suhonen
said
that
in
nhl
selnn
speed
accentu
becaus
of
clumsi
defensemen
i
have
to
admit
that
the
best
player
come
from
canada
but
those
regular
arent
a
skil
a
regular
in
the
best
european
leagu
also
top
european
are
in
the
same
level
a
the
