prefer
to
watch
hockey
than
see
shot
of
felix
potvin
slash
and
spear
dino
ciccerelli
stand
in
front
of
the
net
he
ha
everi
right
to
stand
in
front
of
the
net
just
not
in
the
creas
ye
he
doe
but
the
goali
sure
a
hell
doesnt
want
him
there
when
i
play
roller
hockey
boy
do
i
miss
those
day
a
a

i
would
scream
at

i
dont
care
if
he
in
the
creas

him
the
hell
away
from

so
i
can
see
the
ball

rememb
and
if

wa
nobodi
around

myself
by
push
the
offend
playerhard
i
hate
peopl
in
my
way
when
im
the
goali
and
i
am
sure
felix
doe
too
i
should
say
that
i
didnt

incid
so
if
potvin

he
can
move
peopl
out
of
the

all
that
surround
it
blue
travel

have
to
agre
wholeheartedli
with
thi
view
i
dont
like

you
have
to
clear
player
away

person
favorit
move
im
a
goali
too
is
to
give
the
offed
player
a
good
whack
on
the
back
of
their
skate
when
the
ref
isnt
look
make
em
go
down
like
a
ton
of
brick
but
doesnt
caus
injuri
unless
they
dont
know
how
to
fall
im
talk
about
hit
the
blade
here
not
the
foot
it
also
make
the
player
you
hit
and
anyon
who
see
realli
mad
and
apt
to
take
a
stupid
retali
penalti
unfortun
it

leaf
your
blocker

of
posit
for
a
short
timei
dont
do
thi
if
a
shot
is
like
on
the
short

should
mail

method
in
