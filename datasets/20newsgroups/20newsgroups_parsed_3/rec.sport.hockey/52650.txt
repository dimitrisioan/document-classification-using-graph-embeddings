how
about
tyler
larter
what
ever
happen
to
him
you
know
what
my
answer
will
be
hrivnak
the
choic
is
obviou
ok
but
have
you
seen
tabaracci
play
yet
in
hi
two
start
and
hi
relief
effort
for
beaupr
he
ha
look
mighti
sharp
dont
forget
the
shutout
i
think
he
let
in
just
four
goal
over
eight
period
of
play
i
like
hrivnak
but
we
might
actual
have
to
give
some
credit

thi
trade
hope
