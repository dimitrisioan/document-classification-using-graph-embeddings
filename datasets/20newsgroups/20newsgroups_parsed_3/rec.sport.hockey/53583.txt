on

befor

defens
take

if
they
get

you
fine
dont
give

anoth
chanc
carkner
galley
and
mcgill
are
all
terribl
about
thi
ill
bet
money
at
least
one
of
them
wa
the
closest
flyer
to
the
play
that
all
i
have
my
radio
got
bad
after
that
and
i
wa
lucki
to
know
who
it
wa
that
score
much
le
how
from
what
i
heard
roussel
had
a
veri
strong
game
after
the
game
gene
hart
ask
bobbi
taylor
to
pick
the
three
star
of
the
season
rather
than
of
the
game
it
wa
garri
galley
for
hi
career
high
point
total
im
surpris
that
a
former
goali
wouldnt
look
closer
at
hi
defens
play
tommi
soderstrom
for
hi
team
record
tie
shutout
in
onli
about
a
season
and
mark
recchi
for
hi
all
time
high
team
singl
season
score
mark
but
here
the
odd
part
he
couldnt
decid
between
lindro
and
recchi
for
number
if
he
pick
recchi
a
after
he
had
a
hard
time
choos
between
him
and
lindro
doesnt
that
make
lindro
what
you
wan
na
know
my
three
star
of
the
season
well
sinc
you
ask
eric
lindro
eric
domin
a
game
simpli
by
step
out
onto
the
ice
the
differ
between
the
team
record
with
him
and
without
him
is
no
accid
i
believ
that
the
team
could
have
been
almost
a
success
without
recchi
there
is
no
question
that
thi
team
is
significantli
better
with
eric
lindro
on
it
and
i
think
that
he
will
deservedli
wear
the
c
on
hi
jersey
next
season
tommi
soderstrom
shutout
wa
second
in
the
leagu
to
onli
ed
belfour
and
tommi
didnt
have
a
chri
chelio
booo
in
front
of
him
he
also
didnt
play
a
complet
season
due
to
heart
problem
sentiment
edg
here
my
famili
ha
a
histori
of
heart
problem
there
no
question
in
my
mind
that
tommi
soderstrom
is
thi
team
goali
of
the
futur
and
if
roussel
complain
again
about
be
number
look
for
him
to
be
trade
within
year
mark
recchi
again
you
cant
argu
with
an
alltim
team
high
singl
season
score
mark
there
are
an
aw
lot
of
team
that
didnt
have
a
singl
player
get
a
mani
point
plu
mark
is
the
onli
flyer
to
play
the
entir
season
not
a
tough
choic
honor
mention
rod
brindamour
top
hi
singl
season
high
point
total
which
he
set
last
year
the
differ
wa
that
he
wasnt
on
the
top
line
thi
year
and
didnt
get
a
much
play
time
then
again
he
didnt
get
the
defens
attent
that
he
got
last
year
from
the
other
team
either
dimtri
yushkevich
wa
the
team
most
consist
defenseman
ye
he
made
rooki
mistak
but
he
wa
usual
fast
enough
to
make
up
for
them
i
have
a
feel
that
with
hi
shot
hell
score
a
few
more
point
next
year
without
give
up
anyth
in
hi
own
zone
and
i
suspect
that
hell
be
the
team
top
defenseman
in
year
to
come
garri
galley
wa
the
team
point
leader
from
defensemen
again
there
are
some
thing
you
just
cant
argu
with

certainli
deserv
kudo
for

and
that

against

wish

often
negat
hi
offens
contribut
a
littl
more
caution
and
a

bit
smarter
in

will
make
