ruuttu
now
do
you
think
that
ruuttu
is
onli
worth
i
think
it
might
be
rteemu
selann
compar
to
kurri
selann
point
are
too
high
let
make
it
or
well
in
the
canada
cup
and
world
championship
larg
due
to
the
effort
of
marku
ketter
the
goali
or
the
player
list
abov
and
luck
there
presum
a
lot
of
decent
player
in
finland
that
wouldnt
be
superstar
at
the
highest
level
but
still
valuabl
role
player
howev
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
wow
now
it
look
like
you
dont
like
our
player
what
about
guy
like
nieminen
jutila
riihijarvi
varvio
laukkanen
makela
keskinen
and
even
if
he
is
age
ruotsalainen
the
main
differ
between
finnish
and
north
american
player
is
that
our
player
tend
to
be
better
in
the
larger
rink
the
canadian
defend
are
usual
slower
that
defend
in
europ
and
i
think
that
there
wa
more
in
our
success
than
ketter
and
luck
though
they
help
i
think
that
the
main
reason
wa
that
the
team
work
well
