aargh
paul
stewart
is
the
worst
and
most
bias
ref
present
in
the
nhl
he
call
a
total
of
penalti
on
the
hab
and
one
on
the
nordiqu
the
nord
penalti
came
in
ot
stewart
be
an
exnordiqu
himself
wa
look
to
call
penalti
on
the
hab
while
let
the
nord
get
away
with
murderw
wa
rob
no
patrick
roy
is
the
reason
the
game
wa
lost
and
ron
hextal
is
the
reason
quebec
won
everybodi
said
it
would
come
down
to
goaltend
that
goaltend
wa
the
key
etc
etc
well
the
key
doesnt
quit
fit
if
your
montreal
the
dionn
penalti
wa
kind
of
a
cheesi
call
but
let
face
it
he
liter
left
hi
foot
to
throw
an
elbow
blame
stewart
is
just
an
excus
to
avoid
face
the
fact
that
roy
allow
what
wa
one
of
the
worst
goal
he
could
possibl
allow
he
even
saw
the
whole
shot
dammit
besid
stewart
even
thing
up
a
bit
by
call
a
quebec
penalti
in
ot
montreal
play
a
solid
game
although
they
still
dont
know
how
to
clear
traffic
in
front
of
the
net
the
loss
of
schneider
will
hurt
even
more
normal
i
would
say
that
ani
team
that
blow
a
goal
lead
with
le
than
five
let
alon
two
minut
to
go
in
regul
time
in
a
playoff
game
especi
need
to
be
smack
upsid
their
collect
head
but
i
dont
think
thi
wa
a
team
loss
although
kean
should
have
been
abl
to
clear
the
zone
just
prior
to
the
first
quebec
goal
roy
is
paid
big
money
to
play
he
look
like
a
player
in
an
industri
leagu
on
sakic
shot
demer
should
start
racicot
in
the
next
game
if
not
that
he
should
let
the
damn
team
read
the
paper
for
the
next
day
or
twoand
mayb
thi
articl
if
possibl
patrick
roy
collaps
after
let
in
the
tie
goal
he
wa
shaki
and
on
hi
knee
for
the
rest
of
the
night
the
win
goal
shouldnt
have
gone
in
i
didnt
think
the
wraparound

a
bad
