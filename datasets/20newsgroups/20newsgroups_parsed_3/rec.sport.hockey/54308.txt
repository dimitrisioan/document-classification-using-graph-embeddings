a
mediocr
team
when
he
wa
trade
away
in
he
rare
lost
a
fight
and
wa
one
of
the
toughest
player
in
the
whl
wood

fairli
small
for
an
enforcertyp
i
mean

can
pa
shoot
or
skate
i
never
saw
much
of
it
all
he
ha
is
a
right
fist
which
isnt
bad
but
at
the
nhl
level
the
other

are
smart
enough
to
grab

he
can
land
anyth
signific
onc
you
control
that
hand
