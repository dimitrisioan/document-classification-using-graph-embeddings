write
ten
year
ago
the
number
of
european
in
the
nhl
wa
roughli
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
go
into
the
season
the
number
of
euro
on
nhl
team
have
escal
to
the
follow
stat
canadian
american
european
plea
note
that
these
number
are
round
off
and
taken
from
the
top
player
on
each
of
the
team
my
sourc
is
the
vancouv
sun
here
the
point
there
are
far
too
mani
european
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watch
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
let
say
the
red
wing
and
the
canuck
and
see
name
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshki
is
thi
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularli
annoy
but
the
number
of
euro
on
other
team
is
get
wors
a
well
is
the
answer
a
simpl
a
that
you
dislik
russian
i
live
in
vancouv
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
complet
throw
up
a
it
is
now
everi
time
i
see
the
canuck
play
i
keep
hope
someon
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglas
so
hard
they
have
to
carri
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canuck
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
wa
a
littl
carri
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owner
draft
all
these
european
instead
of
canadian
and
some
american
it
deni
young
canadian
the
opportun
to
play
in
their
north
american
leagu
and
instead
give
it
to
european
who
arent
even
better
hockey
player
it
all
hype
thi
european
mystiqu
is
sicken
but
until
nhl
owner
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
player
will
continu
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
draft
into
their
own
leagu
with
the
number
of
euro
in
the
nhl
escal
the
problem
is
clearli
onli
get
wors
and
where
would
canadian
hockey
be
today
without
the
european
dont
say
that
the
european
influenc
on
the
leagu
ha
been
all
bad
for
the
game
i
mean
look
at
the
way
you
play
these
day
le
fight
and
more
hockey
imho
canadian
hockey
ha
had
a
posit
curv
of
develop
sinc
the
s
when
the
game
wa
more
brute
than
beauti
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
leagu
and
let
the
bure
and
selann
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
contin
oh
