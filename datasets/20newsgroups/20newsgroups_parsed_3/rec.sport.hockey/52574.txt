write
i
wa
think
about
who
on
each
of
the
team
were
the
mvp
biggest
surpris
and
biggest
disappoint
thi
year
now
these
are
just
my
observ
and
are
admittedli
lack
becaus
i
have
not
had
an
opportun
to
see
all
the
team
the
same
amount
anyway
team
mvp
surpris
disappoint
edmonton
oiler
manson
buchberg
mellanbi
well
sinc
the
oiler
didnt
win
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
game
im
not
sure
they
deserv
and
mvp
cant
win
without
him
howev
id
suggest
kelli
buchberg
instead
of
dave
manson
who
ha
had
a
brutal
year
hi
pick
for
the
allstar
game
notwithstand
a
for
biggest
surpris
id
say
that
buchberg
had
higher
expect
thi
year
due
to
hi
breakthrough
year
for
him
last
year
so
he
didnt
realli
rais
hi
game
my
suggest
would
be
shjon
podein
one
of
the
callup
from
cape
breton
dure
the
year
he
wa
quit
far
down
on
the
depth
chart
in
the
oiler
stabl
of
prospect
but
made
a
big
impact
on
the
team
he
ha
goal
in
hi
game
and
is
onli
those
are
decent
number
for
a
thirdlin
player
who
wa
seemingli
doom
to
minorleagu
oblivion
the
oiler
coach
staff
liken
hi
style
to
john
tonelli
i
think
hell
be
on
the
fulltim
roster
next
year
a
for
biggest
disappoint
you
could
name
ani
of
the
player
the
oiler
dump
for
lousi
product
thi
year
nichol
gilchrist
tikkanen
