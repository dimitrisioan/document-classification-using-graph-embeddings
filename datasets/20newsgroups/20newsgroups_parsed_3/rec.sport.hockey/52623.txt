i
am
sick
of
watch
a

between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
let
say
the
red
wing
and
the
canuck
and

wors
a
well
from

from
except
cuba
that
is
canada

in
no
immin
danger
of
be
overtaken
a
the
primari
supplier
of
playerssweden
finland
the
czech
republ
and
slovakia
are
all
rel
small
countri
and
can
not
realli
produc
player
at
a
greater
rate
than
they
are
alreadi
produc
them
and
the
potenti
influx
from
the
former
soviet
union
is
sever
blunt
becaus
the
system
ha
been
raid
and
is
starv
for
financ
and
will
take
a
decad
or
two
to
recov
and
becom
a
real
threat
and
the
u
will
just
maintain
it
slow
increas
canada

player
in
the

besid
we
need
the

is
to
take
it

i
live
in

and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
complet
throw
up
a
it
is
now
everi
time
i
see
the
canuck
play
i
keep
hope
someon
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carri
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canuck
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
wa
a
littl
carri
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owner
draft
all
these
european
instead
of
canadian
and
some
american
it
deni
young
canadian
the
opportun
to
play
in
their
north
american
leagu
and
instead
give
it
to
european
who
arent
even
better
hockey
player
it
all
hype
thi
european
mystiqu
is
sicken
but
until
nhl
owner
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
player
will
continu
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
draft
into
their
own
leagu
with
the
number
of
euro
in
the
nhl
escal
the
problem
is
clearli
onli
get
wors
canadian

under
no
threatth
european
number
will
soon
satur
if
they
havent
alreadyand
by
the
time
russia
come
onlin
again
the
nhl

be
a
world
leagu
and
there
will
be
mani
more
team
to
stock
and
mani
more
job
for
canadian
hockey
player
in
the
near
team
the
percentag
of
canadian
will
mostli
declin
becaus
of
american
not
becaus
of
european
im
all
for
the
creation
of
