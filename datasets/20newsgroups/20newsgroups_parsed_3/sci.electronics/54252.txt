re
whi
circuit
board
are
green
kuusama
juhavtt
write
not
that
the
question
is
anyth
import
but
i
am
still
curiou
whi
is
that
almost
all
print
circuit
board
are
green
i
have
seen
a
few
blue
one
but
no
red
yellow
compani
logo
etc
is
there
a
technic
reason
or
could
it
be
that
the
market
geniu
have
not
tought
about
it
yet
the
green
layer
is
a
soldermask
and
is
use
to
make
a
finish
board
look
neat
and
to
avoid
solder
bridg
especi
when
use
wave
solder
or
ani
other
mechan
approach
ive
seen
red
mask
but
most
that
ive
seen
are
green
a
bakelit
board
will
look
brown
in
colour
and
if
the
solder
mask
is
put
on
look
like
a
brown
board
with
green
paint
on
either
side
or
just
one
side
of
the
board
a
fibreglass
board
will
look
green
from
the
side
becaus
the
green
soldermask
make
the
board
appear
that
colour
if
you
got
a
fibreglass
board
with
no
mask
it
would
be
a
whitishgrey
colour
teflon
board
do
exist
a
well
but
im
not
sure
about
that
one
id
guess
the
stuff
they
invent
for
solder
mask
wa
green
so
theyr
not
about
to
chang
also
ani
chang
in
ani
chemic
probabl
requir
a
better
than
normal
clean
of
the
machin
that
make
board
a
lot
of
compani
do
not
make
their
own
board
they
ship
them
to
a
real
boardhous
