help
with
ultralong
time
write
i
have
a
project
that
wa
droop
in
my
lap
that
is
somewhat
a
pain
to
design
what
i
am
look
for
is
a
stabl
ultralong
solid
state
timer
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
place
thi
thing
on
the
antart
ice
shelf
and
measur
the
amount
of
snow
fall
over
a
period
of
six
week
everi
two
week
they
want
to
trip
a
selonoid
to
discharg
differ
color
pellet
by
ga
pressur
out
across
the
snow
then
by
dig
down
into
the
snow
the
snow
fall
amount
can
be
measur
a
they
come
to
the
differ
color
pellet
the
problem
is
tri
to
build
a
timer
that
would
stand
the
cold
degre
and
a
power
sourc
that
wouldnt
drain
i
have
look
at
the
xr
timer
and
the
standard
ne
dual
timer
but
thier
temp
spec
wont
go
that
low
also
two
week
equat
to
second
per
fire
which
mean
one
big
time
cap
i
have
found
farad
ye
farad
cap
that
have
a
work
voltag
of
volt
and
are
small
in
size
whi
are
you
fool
around
with
analog
for
thi
job
a
singl
chip
micro
and
a
crystal
will
do
the
job
reliabl
and
easili
an
onli
cost
about
that
and
a
crystal
and
your
in
busi
emb
the
whole
thing
in
a
foam
insul
blanket
power
it
from
a
solar
cell
use
the
excess
power
to
heat
the
assembl
dure
the
day
and
reli
on
the
insul
to
hold
the
heat
dure
dark
if
you
dont
want
to
tri
thermal
manag
contact
someon
like
icl
and
have
them
cut
you
a
special
low
temperatur
crystal
itll
cost
at
most
if
you
use
a
singl
chip
micro
your
look
at
a
part
count
of
mayb
a
processor
a
crystal
two
cap
on
the
crystal
a
power
fet
to
fire
the
solenoid
a
flyback
diod
and
a
batteri
thi
is
fewer
part
than
you
can
build
an
analog
timer
for
and
is
infinit
more
reliabl
add
a
power
zener
diod
for
heat
and
a
solar
cell
and
the
part
count
scream
up
to
pd
assembl
are
avail
for
all
the
common
singl
chip
micro
thi
applic
is
so
trivial
you
could
even
look
up
the
op
code
in
the
programm
guid
and
creat
