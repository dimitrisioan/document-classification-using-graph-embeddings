write
i
thought
the
first
thread
wa
hilari
so
here
go
anoth
post
some
more
background
inform
on
what
ha
happen
to
my
poor
batteri
one
year
i
left
the
batteri
in
the
garag
the
garag
is
unheat
they
were
left
in
their
place
that
they
need
to
be
one
in
the
ride
lawnmow
what
a
lux
and
one
in
each
motorcycl
the
batteri
in
the
ride
lawnmow
wa
about
year
old
and
one
of
the
cycl
batteri
wa
new
and
one
wa
around
year
old
upon
spring
time
i
discov
that
all
of
the
batteri
were
dead
and
need
to
be
recharg
they
all
work
properli
except
for
the
older
one
and
they
had
to
be
replac
about
halfway
through
the
summer
they
had
origin
been
store
in
the
garag
and
i
think
i
rememb
my
dad
charg
them
in
spring
last
year
i
decid
to
bring
them
in
to
the
basement
which
ha
two
part
one
is
dirt
and
brick
and
the
other
is
concret
i
brought
in
all
three
and
discov
in
the
spring
about
day
ago
that
not
onli
were
the
batteri
dead
but
when
i
put
the
charger
on
them
the
charger
said
hmmmmmmmm
and
the
ampmet
read
around
in
other
word
it
wa
pin
the
intern
circut
trip
and
i
went
on
to
the
other
batteri
they
were
the
same
realiz
that
we
still
had
gigant
sailboat
batteri
also
lead
acid
i
decid
to
put
the
charger
on
them
these
had
been
sit
for
around
and
a
half
year
on
the
brick
and
dirt
part
and
notic
that
they
onli
need
a
small
charg
around
hour
or
so
on
trickl
i
test
them
by
use
them
at
the
local
ga
station
for
give
jump
start
and
they
work
fine
for
around
of
em
thi
lead
me
to
believ
one
of
sever
thing
i
bought
realli
tti
batteri
last
year
sorta
true
the
concret
ha
someth
to
do
with
the
discharg
of
the
batteri
there
wa
enough
moistur
to
short
out
the
termin
in
the
room
where
the
concret
is
the
dirt
room
wa
abl
to
absorb
the
moistur
in
the
air
better
than
concret
btw
i
can
almost
waterski
in
the
dirt
room
ani
other
idea
could
be
the
alien
anyth
is
possibl
the

the

note
that

sulfat
is
not

solubl

at

and
it
will
thu
precipit
out
of
solut
where
the
reaction
is
occur
or
the
cathod
posit
termin
of
the
batteri
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
the
posit
termin
where
the
precipit
form
but
i
may
be
wrong
oh
well
i
dont
have
a
corrod
batteri
to
corrob
and
i
dont
feel
like
think
through
it
right
now
what
is
import
to
notic
here
is
that
the
reaction
a
you
knew
it
would
be
is
exotherm
or
energi
discharg
if
moistur
with
dissolv
electrolyt
acid
rain
condens
on
the
batteri
a
conduct
path
between
the
termin
may
form
thi
will
discharg
the
batteri
a
the
chemic
reaction
proce
the
reaction
is
revers
if
electr
from
an
altern
or
batteri
charger
is
put
back
into
the
batteri
leadacid
batteri
must
chang
in
chemic
composit

each
cell
ha
all
the
reactant
necessari
for
the
reaction
the
nonreact
post
termin
of
the
leadacid
batteri
are
there
to
remov
or
add
electr
energi
dure
a
discharg
or
charg
becaus
the
reaction
is
exotherm
it
ha
a
tendenc
to
happen
though
quit
slowli
under
normal
circumst
so
while
keep
the
batteri
dri
is
a
good
idea
it
is
not
a
total
solut
to
understand
whi
leadacid
