oh
no
your
not
the
onli
one
analogu
scope
give
you
or
me
at
least
a
fair
idea
of
what
go
on
in
a
circuit
digit
scope
seem
to
have
a
habit
of
invent
a
sizabl
part
of
it
eg
even
when
there
are
onli
a
few
sampl
per
period
our
hpa
display
a
continu
waveform
complet
with
nonexist
overshoot
ive
wade
through
lot
of
manual
page
and
menu
but
i
havent
found
yet
how
to
turn
thi
off
it
doesnt
show
which
point
have
actual
been
measur
a
oppos
to
those
which
have
been
interpol
either
perhap
your
use
the
wrong
brand
sorri
all
hp
fan
but
i
have
a
hard
time
be
convinc
that
their
scope
match
the
rest
of
their
excel
gear
one
of
the
princip
function
i
look
for
when
consid
a
dso
is
whether
you
can
turn
interpol
off
the
other
import
featur
is
to
disabl
repetit
waveform
acquisit
ie
be
abl
to
lock
the
instrument
into
real
time
captur
mode
secondli
i
dont
like
menu
i
want
to
see
all
common
function
with
their
own
button
youll
have
guess
i
love
analogu
tek
scope
id
choos
a
knob
with
print
legend
over
an
onscreen
display
with
updown
button
right
away
the
singl
knob
of
most
digit
instrument
never
seem
to
be
connect
to
the
right
function
at
the
right
moment
i
agre
with
you
here
the
onli
consol
is
that
manufactur
are
begin
to
pay
attent
to
ergonom
when
design
the
menu
howev
to
be
fair
it
seem
that
first
time
scope
user
our
student
seem
to
adjust
to
menu
easier
than
navig
around
the
twenti
or
more
knob
requir
of
a
real
scope
last
but
not
least
you
never
know
if
the
waveform
display
is
old
or
recent
noisi
or
just
incoher
modul
heck
you
dont
even
know
if
it
realli
look
the
way
it
display
digit
scope
onli
show
you
a
tini
fraction
of
what
go
on
most
of
the
time
there
busi
comput
thing
thi
is
one
area
that
newer
dso
are
address
i
recent
evalu
the
latest
box
from
tek
their
td
which
seem
to
be
a
worthi
altern
to
a
standard
mhz
analogu
cro
thi
instrument
ha
a
mhz
ms
spec
mean
that
it
is
alway
in
real
time
captur
mode
the
price
also
match
equival
analogu
scope
in
the
rang
the
downer
is
that
the
instrument
use
menu
again
but
at
least
they
appear
to
be
logic
laid
out
there
are
onli
three
situat
for
which
i
would
prefer
a
digit
scope
look
at
what
happen
befor
the
trigger
look
at
rare
event
and
acquir
the
data
to
have
my
comput
play
with
it
let
hope
scope
manufactur
are
listen

one
more
thing
about
the
new
simpler
front
panel
these
instrument
tend
to
use
digit
rotari
encod
a
knob
now
thi
is
a
vast
improv
over
the
old
oak
switch
the
singl
most
common
caus
of
failur
in
our
scope
other
than
student
blow
up
input
is
mechan
wear
on
these
switch
i
look
at
the
new
panel
a
a
great
step
toward
increas
the
longev
of
the
instrument
