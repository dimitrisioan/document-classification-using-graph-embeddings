some
of
the
connect
can
handl
tone
dial
so
make
sure
the
phone
can
be
set
to
puls
dial
in
sweden
the
is
the
first
digit
and
all
other
digit
are
push
down
by
one
posit
thi
make
dial
and
in
the
process
convert
number
an
interest
task
i
think
all

handl
touchton

anoth

so
you
need
differ

almost
right
for
