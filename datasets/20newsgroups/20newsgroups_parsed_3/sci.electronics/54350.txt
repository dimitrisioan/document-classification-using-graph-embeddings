lewi
write
just
a
quick
question
what
standard
lab
solvent
can
be
use
to
clean
electron
equip
and
compon
safe
ie
not
corrod
dissolv
shortout
etc
the
equip
water
methanol
ccl
you
dont
say
what
kind
of
electron
equip
you
mean
it
hard
to
give
a
gener
answer
there
is
essenti
no
solvent
that
wont
do
thing
like
wash
lubric
out
of
switch
when
weve
need
to
do
an
emerg
clean
job
on
thing
weve
just
use
distil
water
the
key
thing
to
rememb
is
to
make
sure
the
gear
is
complet
dri
befor
power
it
up
again
we
let
it
dri
for
sever
day
to
be
damn
sure
i
doubt
that
methanol
ha
signific
advantag
over
water
i
would
be
veri
wari
of
ccl
not
least
becaus
it
is
danger
to
you
even
if
it
not
go
to
harm
the
equip
not
onli
is
it
poison
but
i
believ
it
