hello
let
me
introduc
a
problem
when
i
measur
a
sinusoid
wave
voltag
with
a
digit
voltmet
use
ac
mode
my
output
is
an
rm
valu
a
peak
valu
over
squar
right
when
i
measur
a
squar
wave
in
the
same
mode
ac
my
output
is
equal
to
a
peak
valu
actual
to
the
upper
flat
boundari
of
the
wave
i
assum
that
a
digit
voltmet
make
some
kind
of
integr
of
the
input
valu
and
divid
it
over
the
wave
period
right
now
i
use
it
to
measur
the
same
squar
wave
a
abov
but
distort
by
highfrequ
harmon
ideal
output
should
be
the
same
but
the
output
valu
wa
onli
about
of
the
previou
one
whi
what
is
the
natur
of
thi
output
valu
what
doe
the
voltmet
actual
measur
and
what
doe
it
show
re
rm
read
unless
the
dvm
say
it
measur
rm
it
probabl
averag

the
input
is
diod

if
you

you
need

question
le
import
to
me
what
are
advantag

disadvantag
of

to
compar

the

advantag
of

imo
wa
be
