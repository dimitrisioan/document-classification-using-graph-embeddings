what

cool

do
in
john
eaton
write
dure
the
nuclear
fission
reaction
the
uranium
fuel
can
get
hot
enough
to
melt
when
thi
happen
the
liquid
uranium
is
pump
to
the
cool
tower
where
it
is
spray
into
the
air
contact
with
the
cool
outsid
air
will
condens
the
mist
and
it
will
fall
back
to
the
cool
tower
floor
there
it
is
collect
by
a
clean
crew
use
shop
vac
and
is
then
reform
into
pellet
for
reactor
use
the
next
day
cool
tower
are
a
lot
taller
than
they
realli
need
to
be
power
compani
are
forc
to
make
them
that
tall
by
some
enviroment
law
that
requir
the
raw
uranium
emis
to
be
held
to
under
thi
law
is
now
under
attack
by
lawyer
argu
that
the
should
be
measur
at
the
edg
of
the
properti
rather
than
the
edg
of
the
cool
tower
elimin
thi
law
will
save
power

i
think
you
post
your
articl
day
too
late
april
st
is
over
i
dont
like
nuclear
powerpl
but
i
think
it
not
fair
to
tell
such
stori
about
them
ok
let
me
tri
to
explain
what
that
tower
is
use
to
st
even
the
modernst
nuclear
powerpl
is
onli
a
simpl
steamengin
it
ha
an
hightech
boiler
but
the
rest
is
still
verri
verri
convent
and
if
youv
alreadi
visit
ani
condens
powerst
youl
have
seen
the
cool
tower
too
if
you
look
at
ani
good
book
about
thermophys
youll
find
a
chapter
about
the
carnotprocess
which
describ
how
to
get
energi
from
a
temperatur
differ
and
that
is
the
reason
for
cool
tower
too
you
onli
can
get
energi
if
youv
an
temperatur
gradient
that
mean
that
you
have
steam
on
the
one
side
and
need
to
cool
down
the
steam
till
you
get
water
again
on
the
other
side
if
you
want
to
get
aprox
of
the
energi
you
or
better
the
uranium
brought
into
the
water
to
let
it
boil
if
you
onli
have
hot
steam
on
the
one
and
cold
steam
on
the
other
side
youll
loos
much
more
of
the
energi
and
so
they
cool
down
the
steam
to
get
at
least
the
of
energi
that
carnot
will
give
them
the
cool
tower
are
for
cool
the
steam
the
vapor
youll
see
is
not
the
steam
of
the
main
core
circul
becaus
that
steam
is
radioact
the
circul
is
divid
in
at
least
circuit
connect
about
heat
exchang
to
prevent
radioact
pollut
of
the
environ
nd
ok
the
main
core
is
hot
but
even
in
the
modernst
hightemperatur
reactor
htr
they
onli
run
at
deg
celsiu
thi
is
still
verri
far
away
from
uranium
melt
point
which
is
somewher
around
deg
celsiu
but
youll
have
lot
of
problem
with
the
boiler
steel
that
becaus
at
thi
temperatur
the
metal
is
attack
by
steam
and
will
corrod
verri
fast
thi
is
onli
for
bwr
the
new
he
cool
reactor
have
temperatur
up
to
deg
celsiu
but
thi
is
onli
experiment
rd
i
personali
think
that
nuclear
wast
should
be
a
low
a
ever
possibl
becaus
the
dose
you
get
will
accumul
about
the
year
today
mrem
and
next
year
mrem
wont
be
mrem
at
all
it
accumul
and
even
in
year
youll
still
have
mrem
and
im
not
interest
in
glow
in
the
night
and
get
child
with
head
thi
is
my
point
of
view
