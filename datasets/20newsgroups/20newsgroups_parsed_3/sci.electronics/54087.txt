wish

focu
on
the
subject
of
warmrun
amplifi
sure
the

run
veri
fairli
hot

that
how
you
get
an

to
sound
incred
good
an
amp
that
run
hot
ha
no
bear
on
how
it
gon
na
sound
the
amp
you
have
probabl
is
run
classa
the
whole

becaus
either
the
engin
or
manufactur
of
that
amp
want
to
skimp
on
heatsink
or
cool
to
save
cost
hmmmmm
there
is
a
correcl
between
warmrun
amp
and
good
sound
or
in
your
word
it
doe
have
a
bear
on
now
i
dont
suggest
that
everyon
run
out
and
creat
combin
stoveamplifi
that
will
degrad
lifespan
but
a
coldrun
circuit
is
much
more
sucept

than
is
a
