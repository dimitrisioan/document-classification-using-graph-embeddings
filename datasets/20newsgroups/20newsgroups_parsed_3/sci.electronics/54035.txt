copi
protect
in

kuosheng
kasey
chang
write
there
are
sever
type
of
copi
protect
and
the
point
is
to
make
sure
the
user
is
use
a
legitim
copi
the
simplest
and
virtual
foolproof
way
is
for
the
program
to
somehow
fixat
itself
to
the
machin
it
wa
instal
on
some
sort
of
checksum
serial
number
whatev
so
a
copi
put
on
a
differ
machin
not
instal
from
origin
disk
will
not
work
okay
so
what
do
you
do
if
some
part
of
the
machin
presum
the
part
on
which
the
code
number
or
whatev
that
the
program
ha
fixat
itself
upon
go
bad
you
replac
that
part
and
now
your
program
wont
run
becaus
it
on
a
differ
comput
thi
is
of
cours
assum
that
the
program
us
someth
in
rom
like
the
bio
serial
number
mayb
and
not
a
diskbas
code
number
obvious
if
the
drive
go
bad
youll
be
reinstal
the
stuff
anyway
i

almost
daili
we
have
at

due
to
some
goofbal
screw

the
point
is
often
we
have
to
reinstal

and
copi
configur
file
etc
from
machin
to
machin
by
far
the
easiest
way
we
have
found
to
do
thi
is
to
get
one
machin
work
exactli
the
way
we
want
to
then
copi
the
complet
setup
of
thi
machin
to
the

some

for
a

thi
is
usual
a
handwritten

for

dont
wast
your

the

pleas
do
thi
regardless

and
onli
distribut
the

jack
the
price
to
cut
your
loss
but
pleas
take
a
cue
from
the
major
compani
who
can
admittedli
afford
the
cost
of
illeg

far
better
than
you
and
dont

it

i
believ

is
implement

cut

make

becaus
if

it

provid

they

they

the
