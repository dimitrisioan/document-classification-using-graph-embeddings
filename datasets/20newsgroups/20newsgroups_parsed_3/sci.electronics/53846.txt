i
would
like
to
be
abl
to
detect
the
angular
posit
low

of
an

sourc
at
a

of
about

more

in

the

sourc
could
be
emit

with

i
am
consid
the
use
of
a
quadrant
detector
from

to
give
inform
to
a

to

the

determin

possibl
an

would

the

would
need

which
is

use
for
coordin
measur
of
human

eg
the
selspot

by

the

these
use
later
photoeffect

lindholm

oberg
woltr

marsolai
to
determin
the
posit
of
a

of

project
use
a

len
over
it
surfac
in

the
detector
is
a

with
four
cathod
one
on

of
the
four
side
of
the
squar
detector
crystal
and
a
singl
anod
the
back
of
the

a

will
produc

which
are
proport

if
the
dot
of
light
from
the

is
the

of

then
the
posit

the

is
given
by
thi
circuit
regardless
of
the

of

the
divid
is

to

when
thi
circuit
is
use
in
the
presenc
of

then
the
way
of
tune
to
it
is
to
sampl

the
