re
switch
p
question
anyway
ive
built
the
basic
up
down
convert
with
pretti
good
result
effici
but
im
run
into
problem
when
i
tri
to
design
build
anyth
that
put
out
seriou
amp
i
know
it
can
be
done
i
have
some
gut
on
my
bench
but
someth
puzzl
me
im
use
a
simpl
choke
a
the
storag
element
basicli
a
toroid
with
a
singl
wind
but
all
commerci
model
use
transform
with
mani
wind
i
trace
a
few
and
they
seem
to
use
some
of
the
wind
for
the
usual
errorfeedback
but
some
of
the
other
seem
to
loo
me
what
are
they
for
better
than
that
anyon
have
a
full
schemat
for
one
of
these
that
i
could
get
a
copi
of
id
love
to
see
how
they
manag
to
squeez
out
so
much
from
such
low
volum
most
commerci
switcher
do
not
use
magnet
for
their
energi
storag
that
handl
by
the
big
cap
on
the
primari

those
which
in
a
linearlyregul
power
suppli
would
be
consid
the
filter
cap
come
right
after
the
bridg
the
transform
is
just
that
a
transform
it
there
primarili
to
step
the
voltag
up
or
down
although
the
induct
seen
by
the
switch
transistor
on
the
primari
side
is
not
neglig
a
anyon
who
zap
said
transistor
from
either
fail
to
get
one
with
a
high
enough
breakdown
voltag
or
neglect
to
includ
a
snubber
diod
across
it
would
tell
you
actual
mani
transistor
intend
for
switcher
use
today
have
the
diod
built
in
the
basic

suppli
oper
someth
like
thi
in

somewhat
simplifi

the

are

at

one
of
the

is
sampl

they

you
may
also

you

thi

in

you
need
to
take
