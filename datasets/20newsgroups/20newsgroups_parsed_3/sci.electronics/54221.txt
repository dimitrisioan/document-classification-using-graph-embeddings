re
blink
led
in
articl
there
a
seeker
born
everi
minut
write
where
can
i
buy
blink
led
besid
radio
shack
doe
anyon
sell
blink
led
with
variabl
flash
rate
by
voltag
i
guess
if
so
what
hertz
puls
rate
are
they
adjust
or
set
to
id
like
blink
led
that
can
be
set
for
approx
hz
hz
hz
or
hz
someth
like
that
im
interest
in
what
out
there
for
flash
rate
i
like
the
idea
of
led
with
flasher
circuit
alreadi
in
them
i
hate
solder
ic
in
gener
guess
i
dont
have
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
patienc
thank
dana
if
you
want
slow
led
flash
rate
adjust
by
switch
or
by
a
digit
control
switch
i
suggest
look
at
a
oscil
chip
they
cost
at
radio
shack
much
cheaper
in
quantiti
at
qualiti
place
and
you
will
be
abl
to
find
good
info
about
simpl
circuit
in
a
oscialltor
notebook
i
think
forest
mim
ha
one
at
radio
shack
youll
have
to
toy
with
resistorcapacitor
valu
or
you
can
use
your
head
with
a
littl
math
to
get
the
right
frequenc
ani
engin
worth
hi
salt
can
make
a
oscial
it
in
the
book
and
left
up
to
you
to
see
i
hate
do
ascii
circuit
graphic
the
can
accur
go
from
a
few
hz
to
about
khz
i
think
about
the
tape
record
gizmo
you
could
alter
a
stereo
tape
deck
to
use
one
channel
a
a
data
line
for
flash
led
and
one
a
audio
line
for
voic
or
music
thi
would
elimin
a
lot
of
nois
the
data
line
is
probabl
most
easili
done
by
some
kind
of
pll
or
bandpass
filter
use
just
an
opamp
the
chip
is
a
good
pll
and
not
hard
to
work
with
howev
if
you
noth
about
how
a
pll
work
i
suggest
you
dont
tri
thi
opamp
inform
can
also
be
found
in
the
forest
mim
radio
shack
infobooklet
and
the
popular
opamp
is
a
snap
to
work
with
set
frequenc
and
bandpass
filter
valu
are
not
so
easi
so
i
would
suggest
the
method
firstmost
i
have
no
idea
what
thi
is
go
into
so
i
am
realli
gener
a
for
manufactur
techniqu
if
your
onli
goof
with
it
i
suggest
you
breadboard
the
thing
no
need
to
solder
wirewrap
would
be
the
next
more
perman
step
and
lastli
solderingpcb
make
hope
that
clear
thing
