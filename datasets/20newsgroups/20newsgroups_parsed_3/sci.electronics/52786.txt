voltag
multipli
problem
hi
ive
just
built
a
valv
preamp
and
use
a
diodecapacitor
voltag
multipli
to
step
the
vac
suppli
voltag
up
to
approx
vdv
a
the
load
resist
increas
the
rc
constant
decreas
and
henc
the
output
voltag
drop
i
need
a
high
an
output
voltag
a
possibl
about
v
the
circuit
consist
of
seven
voltag
multipli
stage
ie
diod
and
capacitor
each
capacitor
develop
about
v
across
them
and
i
take
the
output
from
across
seven
capacitorsv
each
capacitor
is
mfd
at
v
if
i
increas
each
of
the
capacitor
rate
mfd
that
will
increas
the
rc
constant
and
henc
allevi
some
of
the
problem
these
capacitor
are
go
to
be
a
littl
expens
a
i
need
of
them
so
what
would
happen
if
i
connect
a
mfd
at
v
capacitor
in
parallel
with
the
output
and
henc
in
parallel
with
the
seven
mfd
capacitor
will
it
a
i
assum
increas
the
c
in
circuit
and
henc
increas
the
rc
time
constant
if
it
doe
and
my
output
voltag
becom
more
stabl
by
do
thi
then
i
will
have
kill
two
bird
with
one
stone
a
i
am
experienc
some
hz
rippl
and
henc
amp
hum
and
thi
new
capacitor
will
smooth
thi
out
and
can
anyon
recomend
a
suitabl
valu
for
an
inductor
choke
to
be
place
in
the
output
line
of
the
power
suppli
to
filter
out
the
hz
main
hum
lowest
resist
possibl
ive
not
got
my
preamp
with
me
at
the
moment
becaus
it
is
too
much
of
a
distract
im
at
univers
and
ive
got
to
get
my
dissert
finish
in
two
week
henc
im
mail
not
play
with
my
soldero
iron
itll
be
cheaper
too
in
the
long
run
especi
if
new
larg
capacitor
dont
work
a
