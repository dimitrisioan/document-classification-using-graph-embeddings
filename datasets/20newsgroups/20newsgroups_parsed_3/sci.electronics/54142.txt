write
could
make
for
some
interest
choreographi
light
and
sound
could
be
control
directli
by
the
posit
of
a
dancer
on
stage
or
by
the
number
of
dancer
on
stage
neat
you
could
even
build
a
spotlight
that
follow
the
dancer
around
on
stage
can
you
tell
u
more
about
what
your
do
sound
like
a
veri
cool
program
ti
onli
a
gleam
in
my
eye
at
thi
point
i
have
yet
to
chose
a
track
method
the
initi
requir
wa
to
design
a
system
to
locat
a
dancer
in
one
of
eight
zone
across
the
stage
i
did
some
experi
with
pyroelectr
detector
and
found
them
difficult
to
align
to
get
a
definit
zone
transit
and
dancer
stand
still
alot
so
their
ir
signatur
goe
away
the
good
thing
about
pryoelectr
is
that
their
signal
is
proport
to
the
size
of
the
warm
bodi
or
bodi
part
and
the
veloc
of
said
bodi
thi
could
be
use
for
detect
the
intens
of
a
danc
gestur
dancer
also
realli
hate
to
wear
littl
box
and
batteri
strap
on
their
bodi
but
they
realli
need
to
be
emit
some
kind
of
signal
to
be
track
the
current
toy
i
have
been
work
with
is
a
program
call
mandala
for
the
amiga
use
with
a
live
video
digit
thi
work
with
a
video
camera
train
on
the
stage
you
can
set
threshold
for
a
zone
within
the
field
of
view
and
an
object
brighter
than
the
threshold
will
trigger
an
event
event
can
be
midi
object
or
sequenc
amiga
sound
or
graphic
object
it
been
fun
to
play
with
but
the
documentaion
is
arcan
and
the
digit
is
noisi
still
it
veri
appeal
the
dancer
dont
have
to
wear
ani
applianc
you
can
have
ot
of
zone
it
speak
midi
which
can
be
use
to
control
light
and
i
dont
have
to
build
ani
electron
it
all
done
with
light
and
video
bright
and
contrast
adjust
i
have
yet
to
do
anyth
particularli
use
or
artist
but
i
have
hope
