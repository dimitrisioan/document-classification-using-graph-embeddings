write
from
what
i
understand
about
radar
dectector
all
they
are
is
a
passiv
devic
much
like
the
radio
in
your
car
they
work
a
an
antenna
pick
up
that
radar
signal
that
the
radar
gun
send
out
therefor
there
would
be
no
way
of
detect
a
radar
detector
ani
more
than
there
would
be
of
detect
whether
some
one
had
a
radio
in
their
car
unfortun
your
wrong
on
both
count
the
most
common
method
of
implement
a
tunabl
receiv
is
to
have
a
local
oscil
the
local
oscil
frequenc
can
be
radiat
out
of
the
receiv
via
the
antenna
unless
the
circuit
is
design
and
construct
with
great
care
for
a
refer

detect
radio
