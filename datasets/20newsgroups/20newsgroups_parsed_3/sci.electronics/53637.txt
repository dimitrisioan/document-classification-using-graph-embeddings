write
my
friend
ha
a
nice
alpin
car
stereo
and
it
onli
ha
channel
but
one
of
them
doe
not
work
it
doe
not
put
out
ani
current
or
voltag
at
all
is
that
channel
therefor
blown
i
then
shut
the
radio
off
and
ran
continu
into
the
two
speaker
ouput
of
the
channel
and
it
charg
and
discharg
so
i
know
the
wire
just
aint
bad
thi
probabl
onli
tell
you
that
the
dc
block
capacitor
that
in
seri
between
the
onechip
singleend
audio
amp
and
the
speaker
termin
is
there
ani
idea
open
it
up
and
look
for
the
power
amp
ic
theyll
be
fairli
obviou
replac
the
one
connect
to
the
dead
output
also
how
would
i
locat
where
the
signal
of
the
radiotap
unit
is
befor
it
get
amplifi
becaus
then
couldnt
i
hook
up
rca
output
to
that
signal
so
then
he
could
just
use
a
littl
amplifi
well
one
thing
you
should
do
is
poke
around
the
termin
of
the
power
amp
chip
use
a
probe
with
a
m
resistor
like
a
scope
probe
connect
to
the
input
of
a
small
audio
amp
wspeaker
if
you
find
linelevel
input
to
both
chip
one
of
the
chip
is
bad
and
can
probabl
replac
pretti
easili
if
you
want
to
pick
off
a
nearlinelevel
signal
suitabl
for
feed
to
an
outboard
amp
the
outer
leg
of
the
volum
control
pot
will
often
be
good
enough
thi
is
befor
the
volum
control
and
usual
befor
the
tone
and
balanc
control
too
if
you
take
off
from
the
center
and
ground
leg
of
the
volum
pot
thi
will
be
after
the
volum
control
but
again
probabl
befor
the
other
control
if
the
unit
is
a
modern
type
with
an
electron
volum
control
chip
you
should
probabl
forget
the
whole
thing
