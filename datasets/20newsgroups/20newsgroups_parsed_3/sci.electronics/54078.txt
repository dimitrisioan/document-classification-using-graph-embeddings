citroen
cv
damp
get
under
the
bonnet
u
hood
and
short
the
sparkplug
to
earth
so
it
wont
start
the
solut
for
the
car
is
to
clean
the
plug
lead
and
spray
with
wd
moistur
repel
if
damp
is
the
problem
then
store
the
well
thi
is
offtop
but
back
in
the
day
when
i
use
to
drive
banger
i
never
found
wd
to
do
anyth
that
wipe
with
a
dri
cloth
didnt
do
i
think
the
effect
of
wd
is
a
myth
invent
by
the
guy
who
own
the
compani
back
in
high
school
i
use
to
work
for
a
detail
compani
and
one
of
the
servic
we
offer
wa
an
engin
clean
remov
all
that
oil
befor
you
sell
the
car
unfortun
we
did
not
have
a
high
pressur
washer
so
we
would
use
one
sever
mile
from
the
shop
on
more
than
one
occas
after
wash
the
engin
it
would
not
start
a
water
would
have
gotten
under
the
distributor
i
would
put
a
plastic
bag
around
it
to
tri
and
minim
thi
around
the
spark
plug
wire
etc
and
it
would
be
nearli
imposs
to
tri
and
wipe
all
these
area
down
with
a
dri
rag
the
usual
solut
wa
to
carri
a
can
of
wd
and
when
the
car
wouldnt
start
to
spray
all
the
like
area
and
it
would
then
start
on
the
veri
first
time
it
may
be
a
myth
but
it
certainli
kept
me
