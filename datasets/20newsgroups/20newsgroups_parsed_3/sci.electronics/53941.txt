write
one
other
thing
there
are
bubblejet
and
then
there
are
bubblejet
there
are
a
few
bubblejet
out
there
that
produc
rather
mediocr
output
such
a
hp
dinki
littl
bubblejet
wherea
most
produc
realli
good
look
output
such
a
hp
deskjet
ibm
and
canon
both
produc
some
of
the
realli
good
style
bubblejet
p
if
your
in
the
market
for
a
portabl
bubblejet
printer
i
can
highli
recommend
the
hp
portabl
deskjet
although
ive
heard
the
portabl
canon
are
good
too
i
need
pcl
support
myself
with
the
deskjet
portabl
you
even
get
an
undocu
pcmcia
card
slot
i
second
that
suggest
although
i
dont
own
the
hp
portabl
deskjet
i
do
own
the
hp
deskjet
it
give
the
nicest
output
with
onli
a
minor
loss
of
qualiti
for
all
intens
purpos
paper
letter
resum
i
treat
my
deskjet
like
a
laser
printer
you
do
have
to
look
a
bit
close
to
see
the
blur
in
the
charact
onli
one
grudg
the
ink
that
hp
give
you
doe
smudg
rather
quickli
in
the
presenc
of
moistur
even
though
the
ink
is
waterproof
howev
you
would
have
to
spend
about
more
for
laser
qualiti
the
cannon
bubblejet
are
nice
howev
they
dont
seem
to
have
a
much
support
eg
driver
for
popular
program
a
the
hp
inkjet
also
hp
deskjet
regularplusc
accept
xerox
paper
i
believ
that
the
cutsheet
feeder
is
an
option
for
the
cannon
bubblejet
if
you
dont
mind
refil
your
printer
with
cheap
ink
say
fountainpen
ink
then
the
hp
deskjet
are
veri
cheap
to
maintain
i
paid
for
my
last
bottl
of
ink
and
i
expect
it
to
last
month
kimbal
who
doesnt
work
for
hp
but
just
love
hi
printer
veri
much
p
i
have
a
question
for
you
netter
im
too
afraid
to
refil
with
the
waterproof
ink
they
sell
in
artsuppli
hous
becaus
i
had
brought
a
bottl
of
waterproof
ink
and
it
clog
up
my
cartridg
i
wonder
what
is
a
good
waterproof
ink
asid
from
buy
refillkit
to
refil
my
cartridg
