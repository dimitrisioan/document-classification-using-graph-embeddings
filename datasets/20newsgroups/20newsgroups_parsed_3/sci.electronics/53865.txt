i
am
tri
to
build
a
synchron
demodul
and
ive
hit
a
snag
in
my
applic
i
want
to
be
abl
to
chang
the
gain
of
an
op
amp
amplifi
from
to
control
via
a
digit
input
the
most
obviou
way
ive
come
up
with
is
to
use
analog
switch
to
adjust
the
gain
of
the
op
amp
the
onli
analog
switch
i
have
experi
with
it
the
unfortun
i
want
to
switch
an
ac
signal
which
goe
from
about
v
to
v
and
the
is
onli
for
posit
signal
i
have
a
carrier
signal
which
vari
between
v
and
v
i
want
to
demodul
an
input
signal
by
feed
the
input
signal
thru
a
amp
with
a
gain
of
when
the
carrier
is
at
v
and
thru
a
amp
with
a
gain
of
when
the
carrier
is
v
the
output
is
then
low
pas
filter
i
believ
thi
is
call
lock
in
detect
a
well
a
synchron
demodul
look
at
the
thi
is
a
tripl
to
transmissiong
analog
multiplex
with
posit
and
neg
power
suppli
can
be
run
from
a
singleend
suppli
a
well
with
dual
suppli
the
logic
input
still
rang
from
ground
volt
to
vdd
thi
is
a
neat
well
i
think
so
design
for
a
switchablepolar
amplifi
input
opamp
output
control
x
analog
switch
gnd
all
resistor
are
equalvalu
when
the
analog
switch
is
close
the
amp
is
invertinggainofon
with
the
switch
open
it
is
noninvertinggainofon
you
can
clean
up
the
circuit
to
trim
out
input
offset
current
if
thi
hurt
the
balanc
thi
would
show
up
a
carrier
feedthrough
for
high
frequenc
the
slewrat
of
the
opamp
might
caus
problem
especi
if
it
isnt
symmetr
and
it
usual
isnt

now
im
not
