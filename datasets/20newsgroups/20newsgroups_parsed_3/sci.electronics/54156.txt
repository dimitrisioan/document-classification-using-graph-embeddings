i
am
tri
to
build
a
synchron
demodul
and
ive
hit
a
snag
in
my
applic
i
want
to
be
abl
to
chang
the
gain
of
an
op
amp
amplifi
from
to
control
via
a
digit
input
the
most
obviou
way
ive
come
up
with
is
to
use
analog
switch
to
adjust
the
gain
of
the
op
amp
the
onli
analog
switch
i
have
experi
with
it
the
unfortun
i
want
to
switch
an
ac
signal
which
go
from
about
v
to
v
and
the
is
onli
for
posit
signal
i
have
recent
use
the
to
switch
a
bipolar
signal
i
simpli
ran
the
off
a
bipolar
suppli
v
in
thi
case
a
long
a
your
analog
input
signal
stay
between
the
suppli
rail
the
will
work
fine
of
cours
your
control
logic
input
must
use
v
a
the
logic
low
and
v
a
the
logic
high
refer
so
that
either
all
your
drive
logic
must
be
cmo
with
the
same
bipolar
suppli
or
you
must
provid
some
kind
of
voltag
level
shift
circuit
between
the
and
the
control
logic
in
my
case
i
wa
abl
to
use
the
bipolar
suppli
all
the
way
