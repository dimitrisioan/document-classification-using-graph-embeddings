you
left

you
alway
see
them
at

but
not
alway
at
fossil

plant
at

it
is
prefer
to
run
the

close
cycl
wherea
fossil

can
in
some

get
away
with
dump
the
hot

a

the

isnt
a

in
mani
fossil

and
of

there
is
le

of

actual
the

you
dont

actual

run
hotter
than

reactor
nuclear

there
a
gripe
in
the
industri
that
nuclear
power
use
vintag
steam
technolog
so
it
more
import
in
nuclear

to
get

to

not

down

some

do
cool
the
