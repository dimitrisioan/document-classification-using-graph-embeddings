thi
is
not
a
good
idea
i
upgrad
my
motherboard
last
fall
i
would
have
been
quit
piss
at
ani
softwar
that
would
have
forc
me
to
reinstal
simpli
becaus
i
chang
motherboard
opinion
is
understand
i
assum
you
have
a
tape
drive
not
all
of
u
have
about
floppi
around
for
backup
you
know
actual
no
i
dont
have
a
tape
drive
in
the
event
of
a
total
hard
disk
failur
i
reinstal
the
app
from
origin
and
restor
the
data
from
the
backup
i
keep
of
that
with
upward
of
mb
of
stuff
on
my
hard
disk
there
is
no
way
im
go
to
tri
and
back
it
all
up
without
a
tape
drive
would
be
nice
to
have
one
though
ram
is
someth
you
add
all
the
time
so
no
it
more
like
bio
manufactur
andor
processor
type
etc
data
can
not
be
use
esp
with
these
new
flash
rom
bio
machin
with
updat
on
a
diskett
mayb
mayb
not
today
it
doesnt
happen
a
often
i
would
hope
but
then
if
a
bio
is
buggi
and
the
user
get
an
upgrad
the
bio
inform
is
go
to
chang
at
least
the
date
anyway
tag
the
bio
manufactur
is
still
go
to
fals
tag
those
user
who
upgrad
the
motherboard
thi
type
of
upgrad
doesnt
requir
a
hard
disk
backuprestor
on
the
other
hand
to
make
thi
le
intrus
it
could
be
disguis
a
pleas
insert
origin
disk
xx
a
i
need
file
yyyyyi
for
updat
it
would
be
perfectli
reason
sort
of
a
long
a
it
wasnt
done
too
terribl
often
otherwis
i
think
it
would
get
annoy
and
the
user
would
go
look
for
other
softwar
thi
is
silli
it
much
easier
to
loan
disk
to
a
friend
and
let
them
do
an
instal
than
to
backup
your
copi
alreadi
on
disk
and
then
give
them
that
your
scheme
isnt
go
to
stop
anyon
of
cours
it
is
easier
are
you
say
then
the
origin
should
allow
onli
one
instal
what
is
your
point
of
cours
not
if
someth
get
corrupt
and
my
app
need
to
be
reinstal
the
worst
thing
i
want
that
softwar
tell
me
is
thi
softwar
ha
alreadi
been
regist
to
blank
and
it
is
against
the
law
to
instal
it
on
other
machin
or
someth
similar
access
for
window
doe
thi
and
it
onli
requir
a
click
on
ok
to
go
away
pretti
nonintrus
but
it
get
the
point
across
what
i
said
wa
the
program
should
have
certain
restrict
such
a
the
restricttoonemachin
until
the
program
is
regist
with
the
manufactur
the
manufactur
will
then
suppli
the
thenprovenlegitimateus
with
a
patch
that
will
disabl
the
restrict
and
proudli
proclaim
the
legal
copi
with
the
regist
to
xxx
screen
thi
is
a
great
idea
i
like
the
key
system
that
some
sharewar
product
use
the
onli
problem
is
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
big
softwar
compani
to
implement
thi
without
it
get
veri
costineffect
for
them
and
more
of
a
burden
than
a
benefit
to
the
user
steve
madsen
ask
me
about
linux
the
free
unix
