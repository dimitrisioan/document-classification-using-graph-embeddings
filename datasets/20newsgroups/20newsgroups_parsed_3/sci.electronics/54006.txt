to
crack
one
that
someon
els
ha
use
i
can
probabl
make
suggest
assum
the
activ
is
strictli
legal
in
gener
it
is
a
bad
idea
legal
to
tamper
with
copi
protect
it
can
also
lead
to
corrupt
of
file
which
you
necessarili
do
not
have
back
up
of
be
a
they
are
copi

which
can
be
devest
do
you
have
absolut
no
idea
for
practic
applic
and
are
mere
curiou
pleas
clear
up
those
question
and
ill
tri
to
help
a
much
a
i
can
may
we
interpret
thi
a
an
offer
to
volunt
a
editor
for
a
copi
protect
faq
i
am
quit
sure
that
i
am
not
alon
welcom
such
an
initi
i
will
volunt
to
ask
some
of
the
question
if
you
will
provid
the
answer
hey
now
will
you
stop
encourag
him
copi
protect
onli
serf
one
pur
pose
to
keep
the
honest
buyer
from
make
legal
backup
copi
it
will
definit
not
stop
ani
pirat
if
you
want
to
protect
you
soft
suppli
a
good
document
and
support
thi
is
imho
the
onli
way
of
effect
protect
softwar
there
are
sever
type
of
copi
protect
and
the
point
is
to
make
sure
the
user
is
use
a
legitim
copi
the
simplest
and
virtual
foolproof
way
is
for
the
program
to
somehow
fixat
itself
to
the
machin
it
wa
instal
on
some
sort
of
checksum
serial
number
whatev
so
a
copi
put
on
a
differ
machin
not
instal
from
origin
disk
will
not
work
the
program
is
definit
backup
if
restor
to
the
same
machin
depend
on
the
programm
dont
use
a
disk
drive
characterist
if
the
user
did
an
upgrad
to
the
machin
hesh
should
reinstal
all
program
ani
way
no
document
lookup
no
disk
wearandtear
i
did
not
say
that
the
origin
would
allow
onli
one
instal
the
user
conscienc
should
do
that
i
know
ill
get
flame
for
thi
but
with
the
increas
number
of
casual
user
who
either
unknowingli
or
dont
care
about
the
softwar
copyright
it
the
truth
i
have
friend
who
ask
me
for
copi
of
my
latest
game
all
the
time
and
when
i
refus
they
went
after
somebodi
els
casual
pirat
is
becom
more
of
a
problem
some
sort
of
copi
protect
will
discourag
the
casual
copi
ive
seen
what
some
of
my
friend
dug
up
somewher
latest
and
the
greatest
game
all
crack
within
day
of
actual
releas
you
know
how
mani
byte
you
need
to
chang
in
xwing
to
disabl
the
quiz
two
ye
two
and
dont
ask
me
which
one
they
are
determin
pirat
are
unstopp
given
enough
time
but
their
result
do
not
spread
that
far
sinc
pirat
board
are
not
that
wellknown
and
easili
track
onc
found
by
author
it
is
the
casual
pirat
that
the
copi
protect
is
determin
to
discourag
what
i
believ
the
compani
should
do
is
implement
the
abov
plu
a
special
patch
onc
the
user
regist
that
loudli
exclaim
upon
bootup
regist
to
xxxxx
address
citi
state
zip
and
disabl
the
abov
two
benefit
encourag
registr
cut
down
on
pirat
and
make
it
more
traceabl
becaus
if
the
patch
registr
messag
is
encrypt
it
will
be
quit
hard
to
chang
and
therefor
provid
a
stabl
trail
of
who
allow
their
copi
out
of
their
hand
and
thu
violat
their
licens
agreement
thi
way
the
legitim
user
who
doe
not
regist
will
experi
minim
discomfort
who
doe
major
upgrad
to
their
comput
frequent
a
onli
problem
they
have
is
they
wont
be
abl
to
restor
to
anoth
comput
the
regist
user
would
have
proven
they
are
legitm
user
and
therefor
gain
full
right
and
can
restor
to
differ
machin
on
the
other
hand
the
softwar
compani
now
have
a
record
of
where
thi
particular
copi
is
suppos
to
be
if
thi
user
copi
wa
found
to

wa
not

we
know
who
ha
broken
their

a

can
break
that
eventu

that
not
the

is
