first
articl
on
thi
line
due
to
not
have
a
chanc
to

the
news
for
a
coupl
of
day
the
idea
is
commerci
in
at
least
one
product
the
privat
eye
that
a
small
cubeshap
devic
that
the
user
strap
around
the
head
similar
to
a
sweat
band
there
is
a
boom
that
come
from
the
side
on
which
the
devic
is
mount
so
that
it
is
posit
in
front
of
the
user
eye
the
privat

compat
the
innard
are
a
row
led
that
are
swept
up
and
down
by
a
galvonometerlik
movement
the
result
is
that
the
sweep
led
bar
form
a
fuse
raster
there
is
a
virtual
imag
project
in
front
of
the
user
that
the
visual
system
tend
to
fuse
with
the
background

didnt
like

found
it
easiest
to
use
if
i
look
at
a
blank

if
i
glanc
down
