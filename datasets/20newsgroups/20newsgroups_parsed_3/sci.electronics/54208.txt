sharp
write
pink
nois
and
white
nois
are
equal
amount
of
all
frequenc
thi
is
in
most
case
around
the
k
hz
rang
pinkwhit
are
use
to
adjust
for
room
dynam
and
stuff
like
that
there
are
a
few
eq
out
on
the
market
that
have
pink
nois
built
in
most
all
from
audio
control
have
them
i
know
the
c
doe
with
regard
to
what
you
wrote
how
doe
one
adjust
for
room
dynam
and
stuff
like
that
i
ask
a
professor
that
question
just
last
week
and
he
didnt
realli
know
himself
sinc
pink
nois
is
believ
to
be
due
to
surfac
state
say
the
surfac
of
the
silicon
where
there
a
lack
of
a
coval
bond
that
act
a
trap
to
nearbi
elecron
and
sinc
thi
happen
at
low
frequenc
becaus
at
high
frequenc
they
arent
abl
to
trap
electron
how
do
you
compens
for
that
it
seem
to
me
that
you
wouldnt
be
abl
to
compens
for
pink
nois
i
have
seen
the
pink
nois
featur
howev
on
mani
eq
and
i
wa
wonder
how
they
are
suppos
to
compens
for
nois
when
pink
nois
is
not
due
to
man
made
nois
like
power
line
crosstalk
coupl
etc
if
you
have
ani
inform
about
thi
it
would
be
appreci
hope
thi
didnt
sound
too
drawn
out
thanx
