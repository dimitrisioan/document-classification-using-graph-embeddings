to
bring
in
bit
to
a
pc
and
would
like
to
use

or
make
a
new
port
where

i
bring
in
these
bit
lpt

to
have
onli
a
few
input
but
ive
heard
rumour
that
some
lpt
have
bidirect
line
anybodi
know
fer
sure
if
ani
bid
lpt
which
board
have
them
ill
be
run
a
new
dx
ye
it
is
possibl
im
make
a
stepper
control
board
with
digit
input
and
up
to
digit
output
from
the
port
one
main
thing
that
will
tell
you
whether
the
port
is
bidirect
or
not
is
the
bu
tranceiv
on
it
look
for
a
chip
number
l
if
you
dont
have
thi
then
it
probabl
a
l
which
will
do
you
no
good
for
read
in
now
if
you
do
have
the
then
do
the
follow
first
find
the
address
of
the
port
decim
either
or
in
pascal
you
would
writeportxxx
where
xxx
is
the
address
in
either
hex
or
decim
the
statu
line
pin
a
well
a
the
strobe
pin
are
bidirect
line
and
are
read
by
base
address
so
for
to
read
from
statu
then
read
from
you
can
also
output
to
these
line
in
the
same
fashion
a
to
the
data
line
in
pascal
do

consid
build
a
veri
similar

into
multipl
bit
currentamplifi
output
channel
softwar
will
handl
the
way
the
amplifi
output
are
manipul
so
that
thi
magic
box
can
handl
more
applic
than
just
stepper
motor
also
look
for
a
robot
arm
cheap
to
attach
thi
box
to
so
i
can
