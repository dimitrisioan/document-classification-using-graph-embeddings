re
help
with
ultralong
time
in
articl
write
i
have
a
project
that
wa
droop
in
my
lap
that
is
somewhat
a
pain
to
design
what
i
am
look
for
is
a
stabl
ultralong
solid
state
timer
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
place
thi
thing
on
the
antart
ice
shelf
and
measur
the
amount
of
snow
fall
over
a
period
of
six
week
everi
two
week
they
want
to
trip
a
selonoid
to
discharg
differ
color
pellet
by
ga
pressur
out
across
the
snow
then
by
dig
down
into
the
snow
the
snow
fall
amount
can
be
measur
a
they
come
to
the
differ
color
pellet
the
problem
is
tri
to
build
a
timer
that
would
stand
the
cold
degre
and
a
power
sourc
that
wouldnt
drain
i
have
look
at
the
xr
timer
and
the
standard
ne
dual
timer
but
thier
temp
spec
wont
go
that
low
also
two
week
equat
to
second
per
fire
which
mean
one
big
time
cap
i
have
found
farad
ye
farad
cap
that
have
a
work
voltag
of
volt
and
are
small
in
size
but
again
the
time
of
discharg
at
or
lower
degre
isnt
linear
i
wa
think
of
use
sever
timer
chain
togeth
to
fire
the
selonid
at
the
end
of
the
time
period
but
that
blast
cold
and
the
drain
on
a
batteri
over
six
week
is
the
pain
one
possibl
would
be
to
use
solar
panel
but
thi
is
dure
the
six
month
twilight
anyon
have
ani
good
idea
thank
in
advanc
we
firstli
i
would
never
consid
tri
to
make
a
oneshot
timer
your
f
cap
will
have
been
design
a
a
ram
batteri
substitut
rather
than
for
use
in
applic
where
you
wish
to
drain
the
cap
with
a
constant
current
their
perform
in
some
respect
is
more
akin
to
batteri
than
to
a
normal
cap
the
other
point
is
that
big
electro
are
usual
rate
with
toler
so
calcul
exactli
what
capacit
you
have
particularli
when
consid
the
cold
you
should
be
look
at
design
a
micropow
oscil
and
divid
chain
that
roll
over
from
zero
to
maximum
count
or
viceversa
onc
everi
second
if
you
were
to
use
someth
like
a
hz
clock
you
would
need
a
divid
chain
of
to
give
an
error
of
le
than
one
percent
in
the
fire
time
over
the
six
week
period
of
cours
you
could
trim
the
hz
oscil
to
give
you
exact
time
but
the
likelyhood
of
the
oscil
remain
exactli
constant
at
is
low
anyway
i
would
suspect
that
there
would
be
far
more
battrey
drain
in
fire
the
solenoid
than
there
would
be
in
the
timer
circuit
caveat
im
not
experienc
in
low
temperatur
electron
so
i
cant
guarante
that
thi
or
ani
other
approach
is
the
best
