my
next
project
is
to
come
up
with
an

modul
for
fast

use
no

modul
scheme
just
wide
fsk
for
use
at
or
mhz
im
a
bit
familiar
with
the
motorola
chip
but
i
wonder
if
there
are
newer
design
that
might
work
at
higher
input
frequenc
my
goal
is
to
come
up
with
an
inexpens
design
for
a
receiv
back
end
with
if
input
on
one
end
and
an
fsk
demondul
on
the
other
im
particularli
interest
in
way
to
use
a
higher
if
than
do
ani
current
chip
work
up
to
say
mhz
with
intern
downconvers
so
a
normal
if
filter
can
be
use
ani
suggest
john
what
you
describ
is
veri
close
to
what
i
built
and
describ
in
the
th
arrl
comput
network
confer
proceed
i
built
watt
fsk
transceiv
at
mhz
they
are
essenti
doubl
convers
transvert
with
digit
mod
and
demod
at
mhz
the
receiv
use
the
mc
which
is
the
same
fsk
receiv
chip
i
use
previouslyu
in
the
mbp
ghz
data
link
i
first
publish
in
ham
radio
and
which
is
now
also
in
the
arrl
handbook
the
mc
which
includ
a
vhf
convert
section
could
also
be
use
at
these
speed
there
is
a
newer
and
perhap
slightli
improv
design
of
thi
the
mc
if
i
rememb
rightli
while
use
thi
would
have
let
me
reduc
the
extern
if
count
on
receiv
it
didnt
realli
offer
all
that
much
help
on
transmit
so
i
didnt
bother
with
it
the
radio
i
built
were
first
design
and
built
for
kbp
in
a
mhz
channel
but
later
reduc
to
half
that
these
kbp
radio
actual
have
done
quit
well
in
acrossthebench
test
at
kbp
and
speed
is
pretti
much
a
function
of
filter
design
handl
the
data
stream
is
anoth
matter
entir
some
of
the
exist
radio
are
current
deploy
on

in
a

test
mode
while
there
is
not

twoway

due
to
lack
of
resourc
to

been
hope
that
someon
would
get
interest
enough
to
step
in

get

write

to

usabl

possibl
a

to

a
coupl

have
been
on

run
low

if

want

there

valley
the
antenna
is
horizont
polar
i
guess
in
retrospect
my
suggest
are
that
thi
is
a
fairli
costli
approach
if
the
radio
are
intend
for
user
rather
than
backbon
and
you
might
want
to
care
consid
your
target
if
you
cant
arrang
your
path
such
that
you
have
complet

i
think
youll
want
to

the

multipath

probabl
