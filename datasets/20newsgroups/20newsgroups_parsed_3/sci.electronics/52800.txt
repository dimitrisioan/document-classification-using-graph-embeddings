one
news
stori
quot
an
offic
a
say
that
he
had
found
the
radar
detector
in
all
of
the

he
stop
except

he
could
never

he
knew
it
wa
there
thi
tend
to
make

assum
there
are
few
fals
arrest
from
what
i
understand
about
radar
dectector
all
they
are
is
a
passiv
devic
much
like
the
radio
in
your
car
they
work
a
an
antenna
pick
up
that
radar
signal
that
the
radar
gun
send
out
therefor
there
would
be
no
way
of
detect
a
radar
detector
ani
more
than
there
would
be
of
detect
whether
some
one
had
a
radio
in
