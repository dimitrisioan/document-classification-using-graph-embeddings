re
flash
led
with
sound
in
articl
there
a
seeker
born
everi
minut
write
im
look
for
a
circuit
that
will
flash
an
led
on
in
respons
to
the
output
from
a
walkman
cassett
player
how
could
i
do
thi
i
dont
want
it
just
to
turn
on
i
want
it
to
strobe
onc
so
to
speak
per
everi
beep
i
put
on
a
cassett
tape
would
it
be
better
to
use
a
circuit
base
on
the
volum
of
the
beep
on
the
cassett
or
better
for
the
led
to
respond
to
a
tone
of
a
certain
frequenc
is
there
ani
easi
way
to
do
either
of
these
im
look
for
the
simplest
circuit
possibl
i
guess
what
im
ask
for
is
some
sort
of
color
organ
but
not
quit
let
me
trt
to
explain
again
im
go
to
have
a
pattern
of
beat
or
beep
on
a
cassett
tape
so
on
the
tape
youd
hear
beep
paus
beep
paus
beep
pauseetc
with
speed
increas
a
time
go
on
i
want
to
synchron
an
led
probabl
two
of
them
with
the
beep
on
the
cassett
tape
so
the
led
with
each
beep
would
go
on
and
off
real
quick
gener
a
strobe
light
sort
of
effect
the
rapid
of
the
beep
on
the
tape
would
in
turn
effect
the
rapid
of
the
blink
of
the
led
and
if
there
wa
no
sound
on
the
tape
except
for
background
hi
the
led
would
remain
off
pleas
help
thank
dana
tri
look
in
a
magizin
call
radio
electron
may
issu
page
there
is
a
circuit
for
a
midi
light
control
there
andi
andi
belvil
it
taken
me
a
long
time
but
ive
fallen
in
love
