i
put
togeth
a
tesla
circuit
which
wa
publish
in
an
electron
magazin
and
could
have
been
the
circuit
which
is
refer
to
here
thi
one
use
a
flyback
transform
from
a
tv
onto
which
you
wound
your
own
primari
wind
it
also
use
power
transistor
in
a
to
year
ago
i
built
a
volt
tesla
and
the
thing
wa
veri
spectacular

besid

friend
depend
on
their
knowledg
of
scienc
and

strong

i
never
found
anyth
use
that
could
be
done
with

is
there
ani
realworld

first
of
all
realiz
that
tesla
invent
ac
power
gener
motor
transform
conductor
etc
technic
all
transform
are
tesla
coil
in
gener
though
when
someon
refer
to
a
tesla
coil
they
mean
an
air
core
reson
transform
the
tv
flyback
version
tesla
coil
see
the
encyclopediaofelectroniccircuit
v
for

ha
not
an

core
it
is
of
a
class
of
circuit
call
oscil
shuttl
circuit
osc
gener
osc
are
highli
effici
but
thi
version
use
transistor
and
resistor
which
are
veri
lossi
devic
typic
tesla
use
activ
reactanc
instead
of
passiv
resistor
so
that
he
could
achiev
effici
of
and
better
the
usual
applic
of
an
aircor
reson
transform
or
of
an
osc
is
to

how
well
do
you
think
your
comput
screen
would
work
if
we
remov
the
hf
hv
tesla
flyback
coil
from
it
if
we
were
to
remov
from
our
home
and
industri
all
tesla
coil
our
light
would
go
dark
our
car
would
sputter
and
die
our
radio
would
go
silent
our
industri
would
grind
to
a
halt
and
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
use
coal
for
heat
ga
for
lamp
hors
for
transport
steam
for
power
and
telegraph
for
commun
is
that
real
world
enough
for
you
get
the
messag
we
would
not
have
the
convieni
we
have
today
if
not
for

give
