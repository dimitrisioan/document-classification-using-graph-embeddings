whi
doe
a

discharg
and
becom
dead
total
unus
when
store
on
a
concret
floor
i
think
it
becaus
the
lead
get
coat
with
lead
oxid
if
the
batteri
is
not
be
charg
or
discharg
i
rememb
some
advic
from
an
ancient
car
manual
guid
my
father
had
which
wa
to
use
car
batteri
to
power
a
garag
clock
or
someth
similar
when
theyr
not
in
a
car
thi
is
suppos
to
prevent
the
oxid
but
ive
no
idea
if
it
realli
work
the
concret
floor
connect
is
a
red
her
it
could
be
that
you
store
it
somewher
that
it
could
becom
cover
by
moistur
or
damp
air
which
would
short
out
the
termin
thi
may
contribut
to
discharg
but
would
be
revers
the
same
thing
happen
to
my
car
citroen
cv
damp
get
under
the
bonnet
u
hood
and
short
the
sparkplug
to
earth
so
it
wont
start
the
solut
for
the
car
is
to
clean
the
plug
lead
and
spray
with
wd
moistur
repel
if
damp
is
the
problem
then
store
the
well
thi
is
offtop
but
back
in
the
day
when
i
use
to
drive
banger
i
never
found
wd
to
do
anyth
that
wipe
with
a
dri
cloth
didnt
do
i
think
the
effect
of
wd
is
a
myth
invent
by
the
guy
who
own
the
compani
batteri
off
the
ground
may
help
im
not
sure
if
spray
with
wd
would
be
safe
