thi
subject
whi
doe
a
lead
acid
batteri
discharg
and
becom
dead
total
unus
when
store
on
a
concret
floor
i
decid
to
bring
the
batteri
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycl
from
the
unheat
garag
thi
year
to
preserv
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
notic
that
not
onli
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
termin
are
short
i
ask
a
friend

do
anyth
to
the
batteri
howev
you
would
have
been
better
off
leav
them
outsid
keep
them
cold
would
have
been
better
for
them
than
bring
them
insid
a
warm
batteri
will
selfdischarg
faster
than
a
cold
one
when
you
are
store
a
batteri
it
a
good
idea
to
charg
it
onc
a
month
let
