i
agre
i
come
at
thi
from
nuclear
physic
where
one
often
discus
particlehol
excit
and
certain
reaction
have
the
effect
of
appli
an
annihil
oper
and
creat
a
hole
and
it
is
a
subtl
question
the
longer
one
work
with
them
the
more
real
they
becom
there
are
also
quasiparticl
which
rais
the
same
sort
of
question
about
how
real
the
entiti
is
the
phenomenon
is
most
certainli
a
real
one
ok
ive
ask
thi
befor
and
with
a
new
thread
on
these
line
i
ask
thi
again
if
a
larg
hole
current
is
run
thru
a
resistor
will
there
be
i
r
cool
instead
of
heat
can
anyon
design
an
amplifi
that
preferenti
amplifi
hole
current
over

what

note
to
summar
thi
thread
ha
so
far
state
that
the
onli
area
where
hole
are
not
detect
is
the
vacuum
that
is
hole
particl
onli
exist
in
the
presenc
of
matter
previou
thread
have
state
that
hole
onli
exist
in
certain
semiconductor
the
question
that
natur
aris
is
if
the
hole
current
insid
a
semiconductor
vanish
at
the
point
where
the
semiconductor
is
join
to
a
conductor
say
copper
i
dont
want
a
theoret
discus
here
about
whether
hole
could
exist
insid
metal
conductor
rather
i
ask
for
an
experiment
discus
on
how
to
amplifi
and
detect
such
current
if
they
exist
also
note
that
i
have
crosspost
thi

scielectron
sinc
thi
is
now
becom
