one
wa
around

upon
spring
time
i
discov
that
all
of
the
batteri
were
dead
and
need
to
be
recharg
they
all
work
properli
except
for
the
older
one
and
they
had
to
be
replac
about
halfway
through
the
summer
they
had
origin
been

to
the
basement
which
ha
two
part

is
dirt
and
brick
and
the
other
is
concret
i
brought

discov
in
the
spring
about
day
ago
that
not
onli
were
the
batteri
dead
but
when
i
put
the
charger
on
them
the
charger
said
hmmmmmmmm

the
ampmet
read
around
in
other
word
it
wa
pin
the
intern
circut
trip
and
i
went
on
to
the
other
batteri
they
were
the
same
realiz
that

half
year
on
the
brick
and
dirt
part

at
the
local
ga
station
for
give
jump
start
and
they
work
fine

around
of
em

lead
me
to
believ
one
of
sever
thing
i
bought
realli
tti
batteri
last
year
sorta
true
the
concret
ha
someth
to
do
with
the
discharg
of
the
batteri
there
wa
enough
moistur
to
short
out
the
termin
in
the
room
where
the
concret
is
the
dirt
room
wa
abl
to
absorb
the
moistur
in
the
air
better
than
concret
btw
i
can
almost
waterski
in
the
dirt
room
ani
other
idea
could
be
the
alien
anyth
is
possibl
