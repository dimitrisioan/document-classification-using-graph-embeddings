i
wa
also
sceptic
about
the
amp
be
built
in
the
fareast
or
whereev
but
if
you
look
in
the
amp
and
see
what
compon
they
use
and
how
it
wa
design
you
can
easili
see
whi
the
amplifi
sound
so
brilliant
good
pointalso
i
wouldnt
be
surpris
that
the
compon
they
use
offshor
are
of
inferior
qualiti
a
long
a
it
wa
properli
design
and
robust
premium
compon
are
use
it
shouldnt
matter
where
it
is
assembl
defin
i
agre
wholeheartedli
if
they
can
build
the
amp
where
the
labour
is
not
so
expens
they
can
afford
to
put
decent
compon
in
and
go
to
more
effort
to
improv
the
design
of
the
amplifi
a
adcom
ha
done
i
can
not
see
whi
peopl
say
the
amplifi
wont
last
not
with
those
qualiti
compon
insid
sure
the
amp
run
veri
fairli
hot
but
that
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incred
good
an
amp
that
run
hot
ha
no
bear
on
how
it
gon
na
sound
the
amp
you
have
probabl
is
run
classa
the
whole
day
actual
id
be
wari
of
excess
hot
amp
cauz
even
though
the
compon
insid
may
be
rate
to
run
that
way
excess
heat
will
dramat
shorten
the
life
of
ani
electron
compon
regardless
of
qualiti
in
fact
an
amp
that
doe
run
hot
to
the
touch
is
becaus
either
the
engin
or
manufactur
of
that
amp
want
to
skimp
on
heatsink
or
cool
to
save
cost
hmmmmm
sure
i
didnt
mean
to
impli
that
becaus
of
the
heat
gener
the
amp
sound
good
my
adcom
gfp
ii
run
fairli
warm
not
hot
to
the
touch
but
enough
to
satisfi
me
that
the
amp
is
run
nice
i
dont
like
it
when
an
amp
run
deadcold
it
make
one
think
that
the
amp
is
do
noth
the
heatsink
that
adcom
us
in
their
amp
are
certainli
far
for
skimpi
theyr
massiv
thing
with
heat
vent
both
below
and
abov
more
than
enough
to
carri
away
excess
heat
my
opinion
onc
again

the
path
you
