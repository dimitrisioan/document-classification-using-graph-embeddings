i
just
bought
a
new
portabl
cd
player
for
the
offic
and
i
notic
that
it
proudli
proclaim
time
oversampl
on
the
box
now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampl
is
the
rate
of
discret
sampl
exce
the
highest
frequenc
compon
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont
understand
thi
time
busi
it
seem
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
wa
it
realli
year
ago
the
spec
said
time
could
someon
pleas
tell
me
whether
im
get
senil
if
im
not
then
what
good
doe
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
sampl
at
a
higher
rate
the
data
is
onli
ever
read
onc
bar
mistrack
and
such
of
cours
and
eventu
get
turn
into
khz
bit
two
channel
data
oversampl
take
two
discret
data
point
and
interpol
n
point
between
them
for
n
time
oversampl
when
i
ask
peopl
said
that
the
interpol
wa
not
simpli
linear
interpol
but
significantli
more
complic
you
are
quit
correct
in
your
understand
the
filter
is
not
interpol
a
that
would
distort
the
frequenc
content
of
the
signal
you
are
listen
to
gener
these
player
run
the
sampl
thru
an
allpass
filter
network
i
have
done
thi
for
ecg
waveform
from
a
person
heart
and
the
effect
is
rather
spooki
it
actual
reconstruct
peak
that
werent
there
correctli
too
and
fill
in
the
gap
with
the
properli
comput
valu
just
a
if
there
had
been
a
real
sampl
taken
at
that
point
i
use
a
cpu
to
do
all
the
math
it
take
a
decent
but
not
unreason
amount
of
cpu
time
to
do
thi
you
can
keep
up
with
thing
in
realtim
if
you
write
effici
code
in
case
you
care
the
filter
method
us
an
fir
finit
impuls
respons
filter
id
guess
that
cd
maker
use
the
same
kind
of
method
anybodi
out
there
know
the
real
answer
id
say
that
they
use
a
tap
delay
line
with
resistoropamp
weight
to
accomplish
the
filter
thi
strike
me
a
the
most
cost
effect
method
for
volum
product
run
anyway
then
the
purpos
of
oversampl
is
to
move
the
effect
sampl
rate
up
to
n
time
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequenc
antialias
filter
for
the
same
qualiti
filter
higher
oversampl
let
you
build
cheaper
filter
wherea
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversampl
let
you
build
better
filter
so
assum
the
qualiti
of
all
other
compon
in
a
cd
player
remain
the
same
oversampl
should
allow
a
manufactur
to
produc
slightli
better
sound
due
to
antialia
filter
actual
i
think
the
onli
reason
they
do
thi
is
so
that
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
market
gimic
i
would
guess
that
it
is
acut
cheaper
to
filter
an
oversampl
signal
than
not
you
can
use
sloppier
compon
and
give
the
filter
a
rolloff
that
isnt
so
sharp
it
too
bad
that
they
charg
more
for
someth
that
i
think
is
actual
le
costli
to
build
i
serious
doubt
that
the
filter
cost
the
same
but
are
better
they
are
built
to
a
price
spec
and
that
spec
say
cheap
