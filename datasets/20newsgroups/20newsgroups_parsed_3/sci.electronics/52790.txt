out
there
not
like
digit
scope
my
school
ha
some
beauut
mhz
hp
that
are
digit
with
all
the
bell
and
whistl
includ
softkey
which
i
think
are
a
loveley
touch
that
is
softwar
key
you
dont
forget
that
you
are
deal
with
a
comput
those
scope
even
with
all
their
neat
still
make
the
ickyest
look
wave
lotsa
featur
but
ugli
output
and
those
are
the
best
digit
i
have
ever
seen
ive
seen
a
lot
of
cheaper
digit
and
they
look
terribl
i
think
the
hangup
with
digit
scope
is
that
you
have
to
know
so
much
more
about
them
and
how
they
work
on
a
scopebyscop
basi
and
some
of
the
function
are
typic
present
in
my
opinion
in
a
counterintuit
fashion
hp
ha
made
some
stride
in
their
seri
imo
automat
setup
are
fine
for
simpl
repetit
waveform
but
can
give
you
some
crazi
result
on
more
complex
event
where
you
need
to
understand
how
the
scope
is
actual
measuringprocess
the
event
for
exampl
is
the
scope
in
equival
time
or
in
real
time
sampl
mode
equival
time
be
a
mode
where
sampl
are
builtup
slowli
by
ad
a
delay
to
the
trigger
event
each
sweep
what
wa
the
scope
actual
sampl
rate
at
the
time
how
is
the
data
be
massag
after
captur
but
befor
display
etc
one
common
misconcept
is
the
speed
of
the
scope
is
the
hp
scope
your
use
realli
a
mhz
scope
or
is
it
a
mhz
sampl
rate
scope
mhz
singl
shot
signific
whose
front
end
includ
sh
can
support
mhz
waveform
import
for
equival
time
sampl
the
mhz
input
in
thi
case
realli
onli
help
you
when
your
waveform
is
repetit
or
on
a
singl
sampl
when
you
get
lucki
and
hit
a
transient
event
dure
a
sampl
time
so
there
are
a
lot
more
variabl
in
understand
how
to
get
use
inform
from
a
digit
scope
i
prefer
an
analog
scope
for
gener
use
and
the
digit
for
event
where
i
need
storag
for
later
analysi
or
comparison
when
the
event
is
within
the
capabl
of
the
scope
now
for
the
price
of
true
mhz
digit
scope

fall
