interfac
question
i
am
interfac
some
simpl
circuit
that
run
on
v
to
my
cpu
board
which
run
at
v
the
optoisol
is
a
n
on
the
led
side
i
put
the
signal
i
want
through
a
k
resistor
to
the
base
of
a
n
on
the
transistor
side
i
tie
my
cpu
input
line
to
the
collector
which
ha
a
pullup
resistor
of
k
it
function
ok
but
seem
veri
slow
i
can
detect
puls
that
occur
at
about
khz
but
not
much
faster
isnt
the
risefal
time
of
thi
devic
someth
like
u
i
should
be
abl
to
detect
my
target
of
khz
but
i
cant
get
khz
thi
is
done
use
wirewrap
and
the
wire
go
to
the
cpu
and
to
the
test
pin
are
about
inch
long
but
im
not
do
anyth
highspe
in
the
art
of
electron
it
mention
tie
the
base
of
the
phototransistor
to
ground
through
a
resistor
to
improv
the
speed
is
that
what
i
need
to
do
how
do
i
calcul
the
resistor
