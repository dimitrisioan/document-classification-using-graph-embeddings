el
job
for
them
although
thi
shouldnt
be
need
you
might
take
a
few
minut
to
wander
around
the
neighborhood
with
an
ht
snif
for
cabl
leakag
on
your
freq
after
shut
down
your
system
for
a
while
if
you
are
fortun
enough
to
the
find
the
hole
call
the
cabl
compani
and
get
the
highest
link
in
the
chain
of
command
you
can
explain
the
problem
whose
job
it
realli
is
to
maintain
their
equip
and
how
much
of
a
nice
guy
you
are
to
have
track
down
their
problem
for
them
you
may
have
been
lucki
and
made
a
new
contact
that
could
be
help
in
the
futur
you
should
alway
tri
the
honey
approach
befor
bring
out
the
jack
nicholson
impress
thi
ha
work
for
me
in
the
past
with
the
power
compani
when
tring
to
find
loosenoisi
high
voltag
lineshardwar
onli
onc
did
i
have
to
tell
them
i
wa
narrow
the
problem
down
to
a
specif
pole
by
bump
a
whole
line
of
pole
with
my
car
got
em
out
there
that
night
and
they
didnt
have
to
meet
jack
a
a
disclaim
their
method
for
find
loo
hardwar
wa
usual
whack
the
pole
with
a
huge
sledgehamm
after
their
high
tech
arc
find
scope
couldnt
find
the
problem
bill
wb
rotten
zucchini
garden
here
in
switzerland
the
situat
is
exactli
the
same
the
cabl
tv
compani
even
tri
to
stop
amateur
radio
in
switzerland
in
the
begin
of
cabl
tvthey
seem
to
be
too
stupid
to
know
anyth
about
intern
frequenc
confer
or
so
even
today
they
use
the
cheapest
possibl
coax
run
into
problem
they
cant
solv
anymor
a
bill
note
the
onli
way
is
to
look
for
a
solut
with
the
neighbour
befor
call
for
the
cabl
tv
guy
or
the
fcc
the
chanc
to
find
neighbour
with
some
sen
for
reason
is
by
far
bigger
than
with
these
peopl
especi
the
first
one
a
anywher
in
an
administr
peopl
dont
like
if
you
tell
them
to
work
for
the
money
they
get
the
problem
is
that
radio
amateur
dont
have
the
power
to
put
trough
their
right
in
all
case
so
let
hope
they
start
soon
with
optic
fiber
and
get
out
of
our
freqenc
