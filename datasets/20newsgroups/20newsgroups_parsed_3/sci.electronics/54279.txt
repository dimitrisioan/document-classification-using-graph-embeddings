pb

hso
pbso
h
lead
and

iv
oxid

acid
produc
lead
sulfat
and
water
heat
of
format
delet
the
heat
of
reaction
at
c
is
therefor
kcal
per
mole
pbso
produc
note
that
lead
sulfat
is
not
veri
solubl
gram
per
gram
water
at
c
and
it
will
thu
precipit
out
of
solut
where
the
reaction
is
occur
or
the
cathod
posit
termin
of
the
batteri
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
the
posit
termin
where
the
precipit
form
but
i
may
be
wrong
oh
well
i
dont
have
a
corrod
batteri
to
corrob
and
i
dont
feel
like
think
through
it
right
now
the
major
problem
with
thi
is
that
the
reaction
take
place
in
an
acid
solut
pbso
is
solubl
in
an
acid
solut
and
will
not
precipit
out
also
hso
is
in
a
water
solut
a
h
and
so
thu
the
heat
of
format
of
pbso
and
hso
are
for
the
most
part
irrelev
what
is
import
to
notic
here
is
that
the
reaction
a
you
knew
it
would
be
is
exotherm
or
energi
discharg
a
it
turn
out
the
reaction
is
inde
exotherm
heat
produc
more
about
thi
later
what
actual
happen
to
make
the
batteri
complet
useless
is
thi
were
talk
leadacid
batteri
of
cours
the
batteri
slowli
self
discharg
a
thi
discharg
take
place
two
thing
happen
the
level
of
pb
ion
in
the
acid
solut
increas
ie
the
lead
and
lead
oxid
plate
are
dissolv
the
level
of
h
ion
in
the
acid
solut
decreas
ie
the
solut
becom
le
acid
or
more
like
water
if
you
like
now
a
the
post
to
which
i
am
respond
correctli
state
pbso
will
precipit
in
a
water
nonacid
solut
when
the
batteri
dy
ie
is
fulli
discharg
we
end
up
with
a
high
concentr
of
pb
and
so
in
water
so
pbso
form
in
the
solut
and
fall
to
the
bottom
of
the
batteri
of
cours
thi
happen
in
vari
degre
the
more
discharg
the
more
precipit
form
the
precipit
form
a
conduct
layer
on
the
bottom
of
the
batteri
if
there
is
enough
of
the
lead
and
lead
oxid
plate
left
to
touch
the
precipit
more
common
in
a
newer
batteri
a
dead
short
result
i
have
seen
product
in
automot
shop
to
correct
thi
condit
but
they
are
for
the
most
part
useless
they
can
dissolv
the
pbso
but
can
not
restor
the
lead
and
lead
oxid
plate
properli
you
may
have
some
success
with
these
product
for
a
newer
batteri
stuff
delet
to
understand
whi
leadacid

do
inde
discharg
faster
when
store

one

posit

delet
thi
is
where
lechateli
principl
come
into

remov
energi
from
the
exotherm
reaction
will
drive
the
reaction
further
to
complet
if
the
reaction
normal
occur
at
room
temperatur
keep
the
batteri
at
that
temperatur
requir
the
remov

is
a
better

sink
than
a

surfac
store
a

in
the
corner
of
a
pour
concret
basement
and
you
have
surfac
remov
energi
which
pull
the
reaction
along
thi
stuff
is
just
made
up
by
the
author
and
is
complet
invalid
in
fact
the
discharg
reaction
take
place
at
a
higher
rate
at
higher
temperatur
a
logic
consequ
of
the
abov
argument
is
thi
if
you
realli
want
your
car
to
start
lower
the
batteri
temperatur
to
to
pull
the
reaction
along
we
all
know
from
experi
at
least
those
of
u
in
canada
do
it
get
cold
up
here
that
thi
is
not
true
if
we
want
to
start
our
car
on
a
realli
cold
day
we
warm
the
batteri
besid
which
there
is
not

you
