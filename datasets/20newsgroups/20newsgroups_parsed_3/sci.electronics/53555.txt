john
thomson
write
just
a
thought
of
mine
here
sinc
an
onhook
line
is
aprox
v
and
offhook
it
usual
drop
below
how
about
an
led
in
seri
with
a
zener
say
around
v
onhook
led
on
offhook
led
off
would
thi
work
if
anyon
triestri
it
pleas
let
me
know
aye
there
the
rub
if
you
draw
enough
current
to
light
an
led
the
equip
at
the
phone
compani
will
think
youv
gone
off
hook
in
the
onhook
state
your
not
suppos
to
draw
current
which
mean
you
should
just
use
your
digit
voltmet
you
can
use
an
old
vom
but
the
phone
compani
equip
can
detect
that
and
might
think
there
someth
wrong
with
the
cabl
look
guy
what
the
problem
here
if
you
want
a
light
that
go
on
when
the
phone
is
off
hook
all
you
need
it
to
run
it
in
seri
with
the
line
a
i
mention
in
my
previou
post
if
you
want
a
light
that
go
on
when
the
phone
is
on
hook
all
you
need
is
a
voltag
threshold
detector
if
your
go
to
do
the
seri
diod
thing
which
is
the
easiest
just
make
sure
that
the
led
can
take
the
current
i
cant
recal
it
offhand
but
it
someth
like
ma
or
more
care
now
folk
also
consid
the
vac
hz
that
is
forc
on
ring
and
tip
when
the
phone
suppos
to
ring
even
with
a
simpl
zener
and
led
setup
you
might
end
up
with
some
carbon
real
quick
whatev
scheme
you
use
make
sure
youv
got
at
least
vrate
compon
on
the
frontend
also
rememb
that
if
im
not
mistaken
the
phone
line
is
a
ohm
equival
circuit
ani
current
you
draw
from
the
v
or
so
get
drop
across
that
ohm
that
fine
until
your
down
to
roughli
v
when
ma
bell
consid
it
to
be
offhook
but
drop
it
that
far
down
is
probabl
a
big
nono
the
easiest
implement
to
accomplish
the

thi
is
onli
a
suggestiongo
ahead
and
blow
hole
in
it
but
you
get
the
idea
choos
a
higheffici

so
you
dont
need
much

to
get
it
