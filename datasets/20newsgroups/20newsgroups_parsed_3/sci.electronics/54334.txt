i
know
thi
is
a
long
shot
but
doe
anyon
know
what
solvent
i
should
use
to
clean
ducttap
adhes
from
carpet
yet
anoth
suggest
but
thi
one
is
nontox
although
i
would
handl
it
like
ani
other
cleaner
and
it
smell
nice
the
chemic
is
call
dlimonen
and
it
smell
like
lemon
peel
i
think
it
is
a
lemon
extract
of
some
kind
you
might
find
it
in
a
hardwar
store
sold
a
a
generalpurpos
solvent
but
your
best
bet
would
be
ani
bike
store
it
is
use
a
a
chainclean
fluid
it
work
on
sticker
glue
crayon
greas
oil
etc
it
clear
yellow
in
the
bottl
and
you
can
use
it
straight
if
you
add
water
it
chang
to
a
creami
consist
which
is
good
for
some
job
