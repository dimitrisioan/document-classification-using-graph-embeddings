you
on

dont

use
the
proper
tool
ie
dont
use
a
bread
knife
to
strip
wire
or
twist
wire
with

the
inspector
wont

it

the

not

dont
buy

you

for

there
are

dont

for

nut
you
should
have
a

of

plier
for
fiddl
insid
box
and
close
loop
but
it
better
to
form
wire
loop
with
a
loop
former
hole
on

stripper
more
accur
if
your
use
nonmetal

get
a

stripper
for
remov
the

or
do
what
some
pro
do
they
nick
the

grab
the

wire
with
a

of
plier
and
simpli
rip
the
sheath
back
use
the
ground
wire
a
a
zipper
and
cut
the
sheath
off
you
shouldnt
tri
to
strip
the
sheath
with
a
knife
point
becaus
it
too
easi
to
slash
the

appar
stanley

what

for

you
can
use
either
a

outlet
a

on

or
you
can
instal
a

with
a

the

is

prefer
sinc

are
quit

youll

unfortun

the

can
rang

depend

if

you
have
no

a

to

thi

some
of
their

the
oldest
wire
system
your
like
to
encount
is
call
knob
and
tube
kt
it
is
made
up
of
individu

with
a

the

the

the

tend
to
be
rather
confus
a
neutral
often
run
down
the
centr
of
each
room
with

off
to
each
fixtur
the
hot
wire
tend
to
run
from
one
fixtur
to
the
next
in
some
case
kt
isnt
colourcod
so
the
neutral
is
often
the
same
colour
a
the
hot
wire
youll
see
kt
in

built
a
late
a
the
s
comment
on
kt
the
peopl
instal
kt
were
pretti
paranoid
about
electr
so
the
workmanship
tend
to
be
pretti
good
the
wire
insul
and
insul
tend
to
stand
up

most
kt
ive

no

no

either
so
wire
chang
need

entri
sometim
the

isnt

doe
not

kt
from

can
be
tricki
consult
your

modern

practis

consider
more

kt

did
sinc
kt
tend
to
be
in
pretti
decent
condit
it
gener
isnt
necessari
to
replac
it
simpli
becaus
it
kt
what
you
should
watch
out
for
is
renov
that
have
interf
with
it
and
be
cautiou
about
circuit
load
in

it
perfectli
reason

and
add
new
fixtur
on

use
modern
techniqu
after
kt
they
invent
multiconductor
cabl
the
first
type
you
will
see
is
roughli
a
cloth
and
varnish
insul
it
look
much
like
the
romex
cabl
of
the
last
decad
or
two
thi
stuff
wa
use
in
the
s
and
s
again
no
ground
conductor
it
wa
instal
much
like
modern
wire
it
major
drawback
is
that
thi
type
of
insul
embrittl
weve
seen
whole
system
where
the
insul
would
fractur
and
fall
off
at
a
touch
bx
cabl
of
the
same
vintag
ha
similar
problem
thi
stuff
is
veri
fragil
and
becom
rather
hazard
if
the
wire
becom
bare
thi
wire
should
be
left
untouch
a
much
a
possibl
whenev
an
opportun
aris
replac
it
a
simpl
receptacl

replac
can
turn
into

frustrat
fight
with

tape

tube
after
thi
wire
techniqu
the
more
modern
romex
wa
invent
it
almost
a
asphalt
impregn
cloth
often
a

sticki
thi
stuff
stand
up
reason
well
and
doesnt
present
a

and
is
reason
easi
to

doe
not
