write
i
strongli
disagre
i
think
most
pirat
is
done
by
amateur
who
wont
copi
the
program
if
diskcopi
cant
do
it
i
hate
to
disagre
but
i
will
note
i
dont
pirat
softwar
nor
do
i
trade
it
i
simpli
have
met
and
talk
extens
with
those
who
have
that
it
the
fbi
can
tap
someon
el
phone
most
pirat
is
done
by
peopl
who
dont
use
the
program
they
pirat
a
crack
program
tend
to
get
pass
on
resplend
in
the
variou
graphic
and
anim
that
advertis
whoever
perform
the
modif
i
admit
that
a
larg
portion
of
the
busi
world
is
involv
in
give
copi
of
program
to
one
fellow
worker
mayb
take
it
home
for
use
on
one
own
pc
but
such
trade
tend
to
be
interdepartment
or
at
most
spread
throughout
the
busi
a
a
whole
how
mani
time
have
you
had
someon
walk
from
busi
to
busi
let
peopl
copi
disk
it
mostli
a
matter
of
conveni
a
person
see
a
program
they
want
to
use
and
they
feel
justifi
in
make
a
copi
sinc
someon
alreadi
paid
for
it
etc
etc
a
note
thi
is
start
to
chang
a
bit
not
much
though
if
your
talk
a
max
goal
of
pirat
copi
i
bet
that
anyth
that
will
beat
diskcopi
and
cant
be
easili
copi
from
a
hard
drive
will
suffic
what
about
commerci
avail
copi
program
copyii
how
about
program
like
teledisk
that
can
do
thing
diskcopi
cant
and
befor
anyon
disput
thi
becaus
they
feel
that
those
who
would
copi
wouldnt
know
about
thi
after
work
with
peopl
around
comput
one
come
to
realiz
that
the
averag
user
doesnt
know
much
ani
comput
enthusiast
is
at
least
x
better
at
preguess
command
and
how
to
use
them
can
you
sit
down
and
use
someth
without
read
the
manual
and
it
is
these
peopl
who
are
do
the
pirat
not
joe
window
user
who
cant
rememb
a
few
argument
to
the
dir
command
i
hate
hard
copi
manual
and
would
rather
have
all
doc
onlin
not
becaus
i
want
to
copi
the
program
but
becaus
it
usual
faster
and
and
conveni
than
sift
through
an
old
book
i
cant
find
realli
i
find
it
even
out
the
onlin
stuff
can
be
read
through
faster
but
your
stuck
read
it
in
linear
flow
start
to
finish
unless
you
jump
ahead
with
a
search
or
such
a
book
though
you
can
flip
through
faster
than
you
can
read
text
on
a
screen
and
they
usual
have
a
nifti
index
too
but
i
partial
agre
i
often
wish
i
could
grep
someth
that
wa
written
down
off
deeper
end
whi
doe
everyon
think
they
need
to
be
abl
to
make
a
backup
copi
almost
all
new
softwar
must
be
instal
to
the
hard
disk
so
you
are
left
with
the
origin
a
your
backup
i
think
it
a
wast
of
time
space
and
money
a
well
a
it
make
it
to
tempt
to
lend
out
the
backup
what
if
they
need
to
reinstal
the
idea
of
a
backup
still
hold
if
the
origin
disk
go
bad
theyr
out
of
luck
for
about
week
which
is
the
usual
turn
around
time
for
a
compani
to
send
a
new
set
of
disk
if
theyll
do
it
without
