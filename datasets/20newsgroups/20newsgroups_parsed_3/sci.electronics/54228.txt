write
im
wonder
if
i
can
tote
my
american
touch
tone
phone
around
with
me
to
sweden
and
germani
it
dc
power
and
i
can
buy
a
special
adapt
for
that
in
europ
the
question
is
if
the
gener
electron
work
the
same
i
can
buy
a
differ
wall
plug
and
refit
it
im
sure
id
have
to
but
would
that
do
the
trick
two
thing
to
watch
for
in
germani
and
i
think
the
same
hold
for
sweden
onli
some
of
the
connect
can
handl
tone
dial
so
make
sure
the
phone
can
be
set
to
pul
dial
in
sweden
the
is
the
first
digit
and
all
other
digit
are
push
down
by
one
posit
thi
make
dial
and
in
the
process
convert
number
an
interest
task
thi
is
just
basicli
right
the
connect
that
can
not
handl
touchton
dial
is
veri
few
i
would
estim
a
coupl
of
percent
and
if
you
are
in
a
bigger
town
there
is
none
that
can
not
handl
tone
dial
and
regard
our
swedish
dial
system
a
rather
screwd
up
system
that
doe
just
appli
to
pulsdial
not
to
touchton
btw
norway
is
even
more
interest
they
got
both
system
so
you
need
differ
phone
depend
on
where
in
the
countri
you
live
