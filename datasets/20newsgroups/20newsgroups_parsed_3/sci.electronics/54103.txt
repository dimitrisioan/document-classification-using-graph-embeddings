what
i
believ
the
compani

do
is
implement

abov
plu
a
special

onc
the

and
disabl
the
abov
two
benefit
encourag
registr
cut
down
on
pirat
and
make
it
more
traceabl
becaus
if
the
patch
registr
messag
is
encrypt
it
will
be
quit
hard
to
chang
and
therefor
provid
a
stabl
trail
of
who
allow
their
copi
out
of
their
hand
and
thu
violat
their
licens
agreement
you
take
two
copi
with
a
differ
registr
id
compar
them
byte
for

and
you
know
where
they
are
locat
usual
you
will
be
abl
to
find
