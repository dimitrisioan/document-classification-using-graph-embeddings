i
built
a
littl
project
use
the
radio
shack
vdc
relay
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretti
bad
click
when
the
thing
switch
i
wa
do
most
of
the
common
thing
one
is
suppos
to
do
when
use
relay
and
noth
seem
to
get
rid
of
the
click
my
question
is
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switch
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
nois
of
ani
kind
on
the
audio
line
i
will
appreci
ani
advic
or
refer
to
advic
also
exact
part
numberscompani
name
etc
for
the
relay
will
help
are
you
switch
high
level
signal
or
low
level
signal
like
preamp
out
level
signal
also
are
the
click
you
mention
the
big
clack
that
happen
when
it
switch
or
are
you
refer
to
contact
bounc
how
are
you
drive
the
relay
ttl
gate
output
switch
transistor
how
are
the
relay
connect
to
what
you
are
drive
need
more
specif
to
answer
your
question
a
a
gener
rule
no
relay
will
cleanli
switch
audio
if
you
tri
to
tranfer
the
circuit
with
the
contact
the
nois
you
hear
is
due
to
the
momentari
open
and
close
of
the
path
the
noiseless
way
of
transfer
audio
is
to
ground
the
circuit
in
high
imped
audio
circuit
a
resist
t
is
construct
close
to
characterist
imped
of
the
circuit
ground
the
imput
connect
to
the
t
transfer
the
audio
in
low
imped
circuit
transform
are
usual
use
and
the
input
are
short
out
or
ground
secondari
are
parallel
at
the
characterist
imped
sometim
if
it
is
necessari
to
actual
switch
audio
a
second
contact
is
use
to
momentarili
short
the
circuit
output
for
the
durat
of
the
switch
time
telephon
relay
are
handi
becaus
contact
can
be
adjust
to
make
befor
break
and
vica
versa
but
i
havent
seen
ani
of
these
for
year
nowadi
switch
is
done
electron
with
op
amp
etc
a
novel
circuit
i
use
to
build
wa
a
primit
optic
isol
it
consist
of
a
resist
photocel
and
a
lamp
all
packag
in
a
tube
when
the
lamp
is
off
the
cell
is
high
resist
turn
the
lamp
on
and
the
resist
lower
pass
the
audio
onc
again
thi
devic
in
a
t
switch
the
audio
vari
the
lamp
resist
give
a
remot
volum
control
use
variabl
resist
and
you
have
a
mixer
lot
of
luck
