of
mine
to
run

into
a
singl
boom
box
i
have
a

i
wa
look
at
recent
a
passiv
mixer
for
guitar
wa
advertis
taht
doesnt
appear
to
use
ani
power
at
all
doe
anyon
know
what
the

thi
would
be
becaus
then
i
could
just
adapt
it
for
rca

thank
well
the
fastest
crudest
mixer
asid
from
just
physic
connect
all
your
input
togeth
directli
is
to
run
each
signal
through
a
resistor
to
a
common
output
the
resistor
give
some
isol
so
the
signal
sourc
arent
drive
directli
into
each
other
take
a
wild
seatofthep
guess
id
say
that
if
you
are
mix
highimped
sourc
like
some
dynam
mike
electr
guitar
pickup
etc
your
resistor
ought
to
be
mayb
k
k
or
so
if
you
are
mix
linelevel
stuff
or
the
output
of
a
walkman
