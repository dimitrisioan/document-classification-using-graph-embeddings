write
i
have
a
new
scope
and
i
thought
id
save
a
few
buck
by
buy
one
with
a
function
gener
built
in
hmm
now
where
wa
that
ad
for
the
combin
radiohand
crank
generatorflashlightsiren
i
saw
function
gener
ha
a
mv
offset
and
the
amplitud
too
high
is
there
ani
way
i
could
make
myself
a
littl
box
that
could
solv
thi
littl
problem
the
box
would
tkae
the
function
gener
input
lower
the
voltag
and
give
an
output
imped
that
is
some
low
unchang
number
i
would
want
to
lower
the
voltag
by
a
factor
of
one
hundr
or
so
i
could
just
build
a
littl
buffer
amp
but
id
like
to
have
thi
box
not
be
activ
sure
youv
alreadi
got
the
right
idea
ignor
the
ohm
intern
resist
of
the
gener
for
a
second
just
run
it
into
say
a
voltag
divid
made
of
ohm
in
seri
with
ohm
thi
new
circuit
is
the
thevenin
equival
of
one
that
put
out
of
the
origin
voltag
and
ha
an
output
imped
of
neglig
le
than
ohm
you
may
want
to
monkey
with
the
valu
a
littl
depend
on
whether
you
care
more
about
the
exact
divid
ratio
or
the
avail
of
part
how
that
sound

thi
is
whi
those
high
voltag
probe
for

can
be

still

they
