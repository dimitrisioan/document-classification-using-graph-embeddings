make

valu
requir
by
filter
ian
hawkin
write
when
construct
activ
filter
odd
valu
of
resistor
are
often
requir
ie
someth
like
a
k
ohm
resistorit
seem
best
to
choos
common
capacitor
valu
and
cope
with
the
strang
resist
then
demand
is
there
a
pd
program
out
there
that
will
work
out
how
best
to
make
up
such
a
resist
given
fix
resistor
of
the
standard
valu
per
decad
etc
it
is
a
common
enough
problem
yet
i
cant
recal
se
a
program
that
tell
that
rxryrz
give
rq
start
with
q
and
find
prefer
valu
xy
and
z
i
onc
wrote
such
a
program
in
bbc
basic
it
wa
veri
crude
and
took
around
second
to
do
an
exhaust
search
with
a
small
amount
of
intellig
and
told
you
the
best
combin
rq
and
the
best
below
rq
if
you
want
to
write
one
just
store
the
prefer
valu
in
an
array
and
then
search
the
solut
space
use
three
nest
loop
im
sure
you
could
knock
thi
up
in
an
hour
