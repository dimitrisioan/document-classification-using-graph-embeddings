write
whi
doe
a
lead
acid
batteri
discharg
and
becom
dead
total
unus
when
store
on
a
concret
floor
i
decid
to
bring
the
batteri
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycl
from
the
unheat
garag
thi
year
to
preserv
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
notic
that
not
onli
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
termin
are
short
i
ask
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
caus
it
ruin
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
whi
thi
topic
wa
beaten
to
death
a
year
or
so
ago
the
concret
is
not
the
problem
leadacid
batteri
often
fail
from
disus
not
be
charg
for
a
long
time
but
there
no
way
the
concret
floor
could
be
the
caus
of
the
problem
the
concret
floor
acceler
the
problem
becaus
it
is
a
heat
sink
and
a
colder
leadacid
batteri
selfdischarg
at
a
slightli
faster
rate
that
whi
the
old
wive
tale
of
sit
it
on
a
piec
of
wood
on
the
floor
work
to
help
keep
from
kill
the
batteri
a
fast
it
insul
the
batteri
thermal
it
youll
set
the
batteri
down
on
a
piec
of
styrofoam
it
will
selfdischarg
even
slower
the
best
thing
would
be
to
attach
a
small
load
such
a
a
small
transistor
radio
with
the
volum
turn
down
low
and
leav
it
on
constantli
but
also
tricklecharg
it
everi
coupl
day
too
to
shallow
cycl
the
charg
in
the
batteri
such
mild
exercis
of
a
leadacid
batteri
is
the
next
best
thing
to
complet
remov
the
electrolyt
for
storag
if
you
do
remov
the
electrolyt
may
sure
you
keep
separ
storag
contain
for
each
cell
electrolyt
and
put
it
back
into
the
same
cell
when
you
refil
the
batteri
thi
isnt
so
critic
for
a
brandnew
batteri
in
a
fulli
charg
state
but
will
maxim
the
restor
output
of
an
older
batteri
which
may
not
be
fulli
charg
when
you
remov
the
electrolyt
for
storag
