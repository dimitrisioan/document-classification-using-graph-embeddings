about

articl
write
in
articl
ru
crisp
write
so
here
my
question
it
seem
to
me
that
id
have
the
same
electr
circuit
if
i
hook
the
jumper
from
the
neutral
over
to
the
ground
screw
on
new
three
prong
ground
outlet
what
wrong
with
my
reason
here
what
you
can
do
if
you
want
threeprong
outlet
without
addit
wire
is
to
use
a
gfci
outlet
or
breaker
but
the
outlet
will
be
cheaper
in
fact
depend
on
where
you
are
put
your
new
outlet
a
gfci
may
be
requir
you
still
need
to
suppli
a
proper
ground
for
a
ground
fault
circuit
interrupt
so
rewir
is
still
a
part
of
thi
job
howev
the
ground
may
be
connect
to
a
local
earth
ground
rather
than
back
at
the
breaker
box
a
jami
said
gfci
devic
are
requir
by
code
in
a
number
of
place
most
notabl
bathroom
and
outsid
the
hous
i
do
suggest
the
use
of
gfci
outlet
rather
than
the
breaker
you
will
end
up
with
much
le
headach
nois
pickup
in
long
cabl
run
is
sometim
enough
to
caus
frequent
trip
of
the
breaker
gfci
devic
do
save
life
if
you
decid
to
instal
them
be
sure
to
