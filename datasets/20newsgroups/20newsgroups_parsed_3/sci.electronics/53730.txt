joel

buy
beckman
and
hd
rugged
version
for
use
by
electrician
in
the
steel
mill
where
i
work
after
a
while
we
got
round
to
fill
all
the
currentinput
jack
with
silicon
electrician
have
a
regrett
habit
of
not
check
where
the
last
guy
left
the
lead
befor
use
a
digit
autorang
meter
to
check
if
a
fuse
is
good
or
not
it
veri
hard
on
meter
and
electrician
when
you
put
the
milliamp
shunt
across
a
volt
bu
but
that
not
whi
we
stop
buy
beckman
after
a
while
a
lot
of
them
got
funni
in
the
lcd
display
a
black
stain
would
spread
from
one
edg
or
els
theyd
come
adrift
from
those
zebra
connector
and
fail
to
oper
now
we
buy
fluke
the
lowend
seri
mostli
and
we
still
fill
the
amp
jack
with
silicon
what
the
world
need
is
a
meter
that
wont
let
you
chang
rang
or
turn
it
onoff
with
a
lead
stuck
in
the
amp
jack
a
littl
bit
of
clever
plastic
detail
would
take
care
of
thi
and
make
the
world
safer
for
electrican
anyway
not
that
ive
ever
put
a
meter
on
the
wrong
rang
into
a
live
circuit
no
not
menot
more
than
a
dozen
time
anyway
