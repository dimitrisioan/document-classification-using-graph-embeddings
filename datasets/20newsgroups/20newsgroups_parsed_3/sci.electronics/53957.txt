voltag
regul
and
current
limit
one
notsoquick
question
to
throw
out
there
for
you
guy
for
our
class
project
we
need
to
design
and
build
a
power
suppli
to
the
follow
spec
voltatg
adjust
from
v
current
limit
at
a
voltag
must
stay
within
of
design
valu
for
i
from
a
ac
rippl
le
than
mv
rm
of
cours
we
cant
just
use
an
adjust
voltag
currentlimit
regul
chip
our
problem
is
with
the
current
limit
ie
weve
found
stuff
to
do
the
rest
of
the
part
of
the
circuit
what
the
suppli
must
do
if
present
with
a
load
which
would
draw
more
than
a
given
the
suppli
voltag
is
reduc
the
voltag
so
that
the
current
will
equal
one
amp
thu
if
we
were
to
short
the
thing
with
the
ammet
we
should
read
one
amp
if
we
measur
the
current
through
a
ohm
resistor
at
v
we
should
read
one
amp
and
the
output
voltag
by
necess
must
be
v
the
onli
basic
idea
we
have
seen
for
the
current
limit
involv
a
circuit
which
will
pull
current
off
of
the
base
of
the
output
power
transistor
and
therefor
reduc
the
output
so
doe
anybodi
have
ani
idea
we
could
work
from
thank
in
advanc
andi
collin
kcyey
p
if
anybodi
want
to
flame
thi
a
a
stupid
project
i
agre
fulli
but
i
still
have
to
do
it
it
grade
