i
just
bought
a
new
portabl
cd
player
for
the
offic
and
i
notic
that
it
proudli
proclaim
time
oversampl
on
the
box
now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampl
is
the
rate
of
discret
sampl
exce
the
highest
frequenc
compon
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont
understand
thi
time
busi
it
seem
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
wa
it
realli
year
ago
the
spec
said
time
could
someon
pleas
tell
me
whether
im
get
senil
if
im
not
then
what
good
doe
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
sampl
at
a
higher
rate
the
data
is
onli
ever
read
onc
bar
mistrack
and
such
of
cours
and
eventu
get
turn
into
khz
bit
two
channel
data
oversampl
take
two
discret
data
point
and
interpol
n
point
between
them
for
n
time
oversampl
when
i
ask
peopl
said
that
the
interpol
wa
not
simpli
linear
interpol
but
significantli
more
complic
you
are
quit
correct
in
your
understand
the
filter
is
not
interpol
a
that
would
distort
the
frequenc
content
of
the
signal
they
do
interpol
it
not
linear
interpol
though
you
are
correct
that
the
frequenc
content
is
not
alter
more
specif
the
baseband
spectrum
is
preserv
and
so
is
everi
nth
imag
spectrum
the
other
n
in
n
imag
spectrum
are
remov
where
n
is
the
oversampl
rate
you
are
listen
to
gener
these
player
run
the
sampl
thru
an
allpass
filter
network
i
have
done
thi
for
ecg
waveform
from
a
person
ideal
the
filter
ha
a
gain
of
from
hz
to
hz
and
a
gain
of
from
to
the
new
nyquist
frequenc
in
practic
a
finit
transit
band
is
requir
and
there
is
also
a
certain
amount
of
passband
rippl
and
stopband
leakag
with
a
high
order
eg
tap
digit
filter
a
veri
good
approxim
can
be
easili
achiev
bit
delet
about
observ
of
interpol
filter
at
work
in
case
you
care
the
filter
method
us
an
fir
finit
impuls
respons
filter
id
guess
that
cd
maker
use
the
same
kind
of
method
anybodi
out
there
know
the
real
answer
id
say
that
they
use
a
tap
delay
line
with
resistoropamp
weight
to
accomplish
the
filter
thi
strike
me
a
the
most
cost
effect
method
for
volum
product
run
no
they
actual
use
a
digit
fir
just
like
your
but
built
in
hardwar
on
custom
vlsi
chip
for
mainli
econom
reason
anyway
then
the
purpos
of
oversampl
is
to
move
the
effect
sampl
rate
up
to
n
time
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequenc
antialias
filter
for
the
same
qualiti
filter
higher
oversampl
let
you
build
cheaper
filter
wherea
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversampl
let
you
build
better
filter
so
assum
the
qualiti
of
all
other
compon
in
a
cd
player
remain
the
same
oversampl
should
allow
a
manufactur
to
produc
slightli
better
sound
due
to
antialia
filter
actual
i
think
the
onli
reason
they
do
thi
is
so
that
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
market
gimic
i
would
guess
that
it
is
acut
cheaper
to
filter
an
oversampl
signal
than
not
you
can
use
sloppier
compon
and
give
the
filter
a
rolloff
that
isnt
so
sharp
it
too
bad
that
they
charg
more
for
someth
that
i
think
is
actual
le
costli
to
build
i
guess
that
the
answer
is
somewher
between
the
two
a
an
interest
asid
some
of
you
out
there
may
be
awar
of
a
scheme
use
by
pioneer
and
wadia
which
is
call
by
pioneer
at
least
legato
link
i
havent
heard
one
of
these
player
but
by
read
advertis
blurb
and
a
coupl
of
pseudotechn
articl
i
deduc
that
all
they
do
is
build
a
lousi
digit
oversampl
filter
and
let
a
load
of
the
first
imag
ie
aliass
spectrum
through
talk
to
bob
stuart
of
boothroyd
stuart
aka
meridian
confirm
my
suspicion
he
said
that
it
sound
aw
but
then
he
would
wouldnt
