i
wa
a
bit
surpris
that
the
manual
for
my
fluke
multimet
suggest
appli
wd
to
the
test
lead
socket
especi
the
current
rang
socket
the
intent
is
to
prevent
the
testleadisinthewrongscocket
beeper
from
go
off
when
there
is
no
test
lead
in
that
socket
the
manual
is
a
bit
vagu
but
i
think
id
appli
the
wd
to
a
swab
then
wipe
the
socket
instead
of
spay
the
stuff
directli
from
the
can
speak
of
said
meter
i
compar
the
against
the
a
that
ive
had
on
my
bench
for
almost
year
it
ha
been
five
year
sinc
the
a
ha
been
calibr
on
the
dc
scale
they
agre
within
mv
ac
scale
is
within
about
mv
the
would
be
just
about
the
perfect
portabl
meter
if
it
had
the
db
scale
i
didnt
feel
it
wa
worth
the
extra
for
a
second
sinc
i
dont
use
