write
from
what
i
understand
about
radar
dectector
all
they
are
is
a
passiv
devic
much
like
the
radio
in
your
car
they
work
a
an
antenna
pick
up
that
radar
signal
that
the
radar
gun
send
out
therefor
there
would
be
no
way
of
detect
a
radar
detector
ani
more
than
there
would
be
of
detect
whether
some
one
had
a
radio
in
their
car
from
my
rather
rusti
knowledg
of
radio
most
radio
receiv
use
a
superhet
circuit
so
that
the
incom
signal
is
mix
with
a
local
oscil
give
a
fix
intermedi
frequenc
if
that
is
more
easili
amplifi
the
detector
detector
work
by
pick
up
if
reradi
from
your
radar
detector
in
britain
where
one
hasus
to
pay
for
a
tv
licenc
there
arewer
tv
detector
van
prowl
the
street
look
for
peopl
who
hadnt
paid
their
licenc
fee
they
had
a
coupl
of
long
solenoid
antenna
on
the
roof
and
i
believ
could
triangul
an
oper
tv
from
the
if
i
wonder
how
much
of
the
if
is
radiat
back
from
the
detector
antenna
and
how
much
from
the
rest
of
the
modul
it
might
be
worth
put
the
detector
in
a
proper
rf
shield
