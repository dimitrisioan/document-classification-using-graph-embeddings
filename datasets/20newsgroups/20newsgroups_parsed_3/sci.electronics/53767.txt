just
a
few
comment
about
the
feasabl
of
zip
up
a
bunch
of
mile
on
your
electron
odomet
with
an
oscil
i
wouldnt
expect
to
be
abl
to
do
thi
not
becaus
the
engin
at
bmw
are
put
in
antifraud
logic
but
just
becaus
an
automobil
is
a
noisi
hostil
environ
for
electron
and
i
would
expect
the
softwar
to
be
conserv
if
i
were
to
design
a
microprocessorbas
odometerspeedomet
program
it
would
have
the
follow
featur
just
off
the
top
of
my

debouncingdeglitch
is
thi
a
real

just
a

can
not
be

high
thi
