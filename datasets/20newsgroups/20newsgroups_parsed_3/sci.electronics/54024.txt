wonder
if
it
possibl
to
use
radio
wave
to
measur
the
distanc
between
a
transmitt
and
receiv
ye
it
call
radar
well
actual
not
quit
both
radar
and
radioaltimet
measur
distanc

measur
the
time
requir
to
transmit
a
signal
then
receiv
it
reflect

a

radar
gener
use

while
radio
altimet
use
either
pul
or
a
modul
continuouswav
transmiss
in
the
case
of
the
latter
highli
accur
distanc
measur
can
be
made

note
howev
that
thi
is
a
differ

of
measur
than
the
poster
origin
ask
about
the
problem
with
gain
accur
measur
between
a
transmitt
and
a
seper
receiv
is
that
you
need
a
highli
accur
time
base
which
start
at
the
receiv
at
the
exact
instant
the
transmitt
trigger
thi
can
not
be
wire
connect
sinc
radio
wave
will
actual
travel
faster
in
freespac
air
in
thi
case
than
wire
the
differ
is
call
the
veloc
factor
of
the
cabl
so
you
need
to
resort
to
a
common
timebas
that
is
automat
correct
for
distanc
etc
someth
like
a
pll
connect
to
a
gp
receiv
should
do
the
trick
trigger
both
the
transmitt
and
receiv
simultan
sound
expens
not
too
bad
but
plan
on
spend
a
few
buck
in
both
equip
and
effort
whi
not
go
to
a
differ
method
surveyor
use
a
laserlight
system
where
again
the
reflect
time
is
measur
whi
not
tri
thi
sound
like
someth
a
pe
should
know
about
anyway
seem
to
me
that
you
should
be
abl
to
measur
the
signal
strength
and
determin
distanc
thi
would
be
for
short
distanc
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuraci
of
inch
or
so
thi
is
actual
highli
inaccur
sinc
the
power
output
of
a
transmitt
vari
from
unit
to
unit
there
are
varianc
in
the
antenna
and
transmiss
line
and
the
receiv
may
also
vari
both
from
unit
to
unit
and
the
same
unit
over
time
you
would
need
to
continu
calibr
the
entir
system
with
the
radio
altimet
thi
is
also
done
but
sinc
everyth
is
locat
at
one
place
it
is
much
easier
to
do
note
especi
that
the
time
base
for
the
ra
receiv
and
transmitt
is
one
unit
also
depend
on

thi
