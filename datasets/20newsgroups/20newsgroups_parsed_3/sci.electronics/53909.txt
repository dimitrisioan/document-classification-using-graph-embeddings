i
built
a
littl
project
use
the
radio
shack
vdc
relay
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretti
bad
click
when
the
thing
switch
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switch
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
nois
of
ani
kind
on
the
audio
line
with
relay
alon
you
will
alway
get
a
transient
when
you
abruptli
turn
on
or
off
ani
channel
if
you
dont
want
to
hear
the
transient
use
some
other
devic
a
photoresistoroutput
optoisol
is
the
usual
sort
of
thing
to
gentli
mute
the
signal
then
switch
then
remov
the
power
from
the
lamp
in
the
optoisol
it
use
to
be
standard
practic
to
employ
photoresistor
in
switch
audio
becaus
the
photoresistor
time
delay
a
few
thousandth
of
a
second
kept
ani
nois
in
the
digit
side
which
drive
the
lamp
from
contamin
the
audio
and
the
devic
are
cheaper
than
relay
