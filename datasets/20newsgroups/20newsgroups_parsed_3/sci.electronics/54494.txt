re
use
gener
power
on
larg
sound
system
in
articl
pete
ashdown
write
ive
bother
the
rental
shop
and
audio
shop
about
the
problem
but
most
of
them
have
preciou
littl
experi
in
deal
with
gener
power
my
suspicion
is
that
i
dont
realli
need
anyth
larger
than
kw
and
thi
could
all
be
resolv
with
a
transform
of
some
sort
nope
your
problem
is
either
be
caus
by
excess
voltag
drop
in
the
long
cabl
from
the
gener
or
just
plain
not
have
enough
power
i
would
suspect
that
those
amp
are
go
to
draw
a
lot
of
current
on
short
peak
you
can
tri
use
larger
and
shorter
cabl
to
the
gener
or
tri
strap
the
amp
for
v
servic
and
run
v
main
cabl
out
which
will
minim
the
line
drop
if
these
dont
work
though
your
go
to
need
a
bigger
gener
i
assum
that
your
use
wellmaintain
gener
and
have
watch
the
voltag
output
on
the
gener
properli
if
you
dont
have
v
come
out
of
the
unload
gener
youll
never
get
v
at
the
other
end
can
anyon
offer
ani
advic
i
want
to
do
a
lot
of
outdoor
event
thi
summer
and
it
would
be
nice
if
thi
power
problem
could
be
resolv
easili
ive
been
look
into
buy
a
powerpack
so
i
could
tap
into
junction
box
directli
but
have
no
idea
where
to
start
one
that
would
resolv
my
gener
problem
a
well
would
be
of
high
valu
to
me
i
recommend
you
talk
with
an
electrician
who
ha
experi
in
thi
sort
of
work
and
not
with
the
proaudio
peopl
also
i
recommend
that
you
dont
tri
to
tap
into
junction
box
at
all
but
hire
a
licens
electrician
if
you
dont
realli
know
what
you
are
do
ive
had
to
clean
up
after
two
peopl
who
nearli
kill
themselv
play
in
hot
a
box
and
it
wasnt
much
fun
