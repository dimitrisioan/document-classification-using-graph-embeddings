do
analog
system
need
ground
plane
soh
kam
yung
write
i
understand
the
need
for
a
ground
plane
in
a
digit
system
howev
i
would
like
to
know
if
such
a
ground
plane
is
also
necessari
in
an
analog
system
note
thi
ground
plane
will
not
be
connect
except
at
one
point
to
the
signal
ground
i
keep
get
conflict
answer
over
thi
doe
have
a
ground
plane
in
an
analog
system
help
reduc
nois
also
my
system
onli
deal
with
low
frequenc
signal
up
to
hz
onli
well
one
reason
for
get
conflict
answer
is
that
it
depend
on
what
you
want
the
ground
plane
to
do
a
continu
conductor
is
a
good
electrostat
shield
do
you
have
signal
on
your
board
that
need
shield
rom
other
thing
thi
shield
wont
do
much
good
for
magnet
field
unless
you
make
it
continu
around
the
circuit
to
be
shield
like
a
faraday
cage
the
flip
side
of
the
coin
if
you
are
work
with
veri
high
imped
you
could
end
up
with
capacit
to
the
gound
plane
that
caus
problem
you
arent
like
to
encount
thi
at
hz
but
at
khz
it
can
be
a
real
problem
one
that
bit
