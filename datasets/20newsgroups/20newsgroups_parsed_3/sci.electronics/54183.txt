i
hate
hard
copi
manual
and
would
rather
have
all
doc
onlin
not
becaus
i
want
to
copi
the
program
but
becaus
it
usual
faster
and
and
conveni
than
sift
through
an
old
book
i
cant
find
just
mho
but
i
prefer
hardcopi
book
becaus
you
can
have
three
or
four
of
them
open
spread
across
the
bed
next
to
the
desk
in
my
dorm
and
refer
them
while
use
the
program
fullscreen
the
window
help
thing
come
closest
to
good
onlin
document
ive
seen
but
they
gener
arent
detail
enough
and
would
probabl
take
a
larg
amount
of
space
even
compress
which
is
at
a
premium
on
my
system
in
fact
the
manual
are
the
primari
reason
i
bought
borland
c
compil
instead
of
use
the
one
the
lab
licens
in
the
lab
of
cours
ive
got
a
shelf
full
of
book
to
help
me
out
when
im
stuck
to
each
hi
own
it
is
also
much
easier
to
scribbl
correct
on
a
hardcopi
manual
