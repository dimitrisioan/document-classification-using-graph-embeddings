audio
hz
telephon
system
have
the
capabl
of
a
passband
of
hz
to
khz
the
reason
they
do
not
implement
thi
is
it
is
not
backward
compat
to
everi
telephon
system
in

the

closli
matech
a
hzkhz
passband
close
but
no
banana
to
paraphras
garfield
the
reason
hz
is
use
is
that
voic
channel
use
to
occupi
khz
band
when
multiplex
on
a
trunk
line
therefor
hz
at
the
bottom
and
hz
at
the
top
of
thi
band
were
filter
to
minimis
interfer
with
the
next
band
nowaday
digit
trunk
have
made
thi
le
relev
but
the
phone
compani
still
see
no
reason
to
improv
qualiti
especi
for
free
therefor
digit
chunk
of
a
trunk
segment
still
have
a
guarante
bandwidth
of
onli
khz
so
they
can
carri
the
equival
of
one
analog
line
at
the
clock
rate
of
a
standard
pcm
t
or
e
digit
trunk
it
all
histor
here
in

uk
the
bandwidth
restrict
appar

those
use

privat
line
which
are
run
from
the
local
exchang
to
the

client
are
usual
capabl
of
a
higher
bandwidth
if
the

is
digit
dont
