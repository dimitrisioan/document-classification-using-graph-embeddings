for
sure
that
the
everex

purpos
bidirect
io
mode
also
i

sure
that
the
ibm
technic
refer
say
the
follow
about
the
monochrom
display
printer
adapt
and
the
ibm
parallel
printer
adapt
it
is
essenti
that
the
extern
devic
not
tri
to
pull
these
line
refer
to
the
data
line
to
ground
and
later
if
an
extern
devic
should
be
drive
data
on
these
pin
in
violat
of
usag
ground
rule
at
the
time
of
an
input
thi
data
will
be
ore
with
the
latch
content
i
will
accept
no
respons
if
you

damag
of
ani

a
a
result
of

say
i
do
not

be
abl
to
use
a
tradit
parallel
port
a
an
input
port
by
write
x
to
the
data
line
and
then
read
from
the
data
line
while
an
extern
devic
drive
them
the
input
data
will
not
be
latch
so
nois
could
make
