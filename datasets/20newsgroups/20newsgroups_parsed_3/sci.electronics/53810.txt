an
assist
manag
at
a
local
art
theater
here
in
columbu
id
like
to
expand
our
show
autom
a
bit
name
add
the
capabl
to
use
cue
tape
to
bring
the
houselight
up
our
current
autom
consol
date
from
the
earli
s
and
dont
provid
thi
function
we
alreadi
have
the
combo
failsafecontact
roller
to
read
the
cuetap
and
our
dimmer
system
will
rais
the
houselight
when
it
fadeup
control
circuit
vac
is
momentarili
close
for
at
least
second
ive
tri
wire
the
dimmer
control
to
a
v
relay
activ
when
the
cue
tape
complet
the
circuit
low
tech
and
simpl
but
there
one
problem
in
order
to
get
the
second
puls
there
need
to
be
a
shload
of
cuetap
on
the
film
mm
run
at
foot
per
minut
so
to
get
a
second
puls
there
need
to
be
at
least
inch
of
solid
cuetap
ideal
i
would
like
to
use
a
singl
crosscu
to
accomplish
thi
function
a
singl
strip
of
cuetap
perpendicular
to
the
length
of
the
film
thi
would
give
a
puls
of
approxim
of
a
second
what
i
need
is
a
circuit
to
detect
the
short
cue
and
activ
the
relay
for
around
second
the
abil
to
adjust
how
long
the
relay
is
activ
would
be
nice
i
figur
thi
would
requir
an
rc
circuit
of
some
sort
im
sure
some
