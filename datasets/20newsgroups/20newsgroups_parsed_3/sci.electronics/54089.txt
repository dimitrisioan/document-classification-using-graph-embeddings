kuosheng
kasey
chang
wrote
the
program
is
definit
backup
if
restor
to
the
same
machin
depend
on
the
programm
dont
use
a
disk
drive
characterist
if
the
user
did
an
upgrad
to
the
machin
hesh
should
reinstal
all
program
ani
way
no
document
lookup
no
disk
wearandtear
thi
is
not
a
good
idea
i
upgrad
my
motherboard
last
fall
i
would
have
been
quit
piss
at
ani
softwar
that
would
have
forc
me
to
reinstal
simpli
becaus
i
chang
motherboard
ani
info
in
the
bio
is
too
volatil
to
use
a
a
checksum
are
you
go
to
requir
that
a
user
reinstal
all
their
softwar
if
they
add
mb
of
ram
to
their
comput
i
did
that
a
coupl
of
week
ago
it
in
the
bio
and
if
softwar
had
told
me
thi
isnt
the
machin
you
instal
me
on
i
would
never
have
use
that
softwar
again
realli
bad
idea
i
did
not
say
that
the
origin
would
allow
onli
one
instal
the
user
conscienc
should
do
that
thi
is
silli
it
much
easier
to
loan
disk
to
a
friend
and
let
them
do
an
instal
than
to
backup
your
copi
alreadi
on
disk
and
then
give
them
that
your
scheme
isnt
go
to
stop
anyon
you
know
how
mani
byte
you
need
to
chang
in
xwing
to
disabl
the
quiz
two
ye
two
and
dont
ask
me
which
one
they
are
do
you
know
ani
assembl
languag
at
all
all
anyon
need
to
do
if
find
the
part
of
the
code
that
doe
the
quiz
and
insert
a
jmp
instruct
to
just
complet
skip
it
not
that
difficult
realli
and
there
is
veri
littl
that
commpani
can
do
to
stop
thi
type
of
thing
use
pklite
or
some
similar
util
would
help
but
onli
if
the
result
compress
exe
were
tag
a
uncompress
what
i
believ
the
compani
should
do
is
implement
the
abov
plu
a
special
patch
onc
the
user
regist
that
loudli
exclaim
upon
bootup
regist
to
xxxxx
address
citi
state
zip
and
disabl
the
abov
thi
is
by
far
the
best
idea
you
present
in
your
post
make
it
plainli
obviou
who
regist
is
go
to
stop
casual
pirat
but
the
determin
one
are
just
go
to
answer
joe
blow
to
the
question
of
what
your
name
so
thi
wont
stop
them
in
the
long
run
pirat
are
alway
go
to
win
thi
fight
they
simpli
have
more
time
to
work
on
the
softwar
and
figur
out
the
protect
scheme
steve
madsen
ask
me
about
linux
the
free
unix
