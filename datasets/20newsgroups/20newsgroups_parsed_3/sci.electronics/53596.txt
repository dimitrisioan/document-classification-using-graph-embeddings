re
a
question
about
v
so
here
my
question
it
seem
to
me
that
id
have
the
same
electr
circuit
if
i
hook
the
neutral
jumper
from
the
neutral
over
to
the
ground
screw
on
new
three
prong
ground
outlet
what
wrong
with
my
reason
here
first
go
to
the
local
hardwar
store
and
pick
up
a
copi
of
wire
simplifi
by
hl
richter
now
if
your
hous
is
wire
with
metal
conduit
you
dont
need
a
seper
ground
wire
assum
the
hous
is
wire
correctli
and
the
pipe
are
connect
to
a
cold
water
pipe
in
your
basement
the
outlet
that
have
a
neutral
hook
to
the
ground
screw
seem
wrong
anyon
els
think
so
back
in
the
s
i
wa
a
servic
technician
for
a
cash
regist
compani
the
cash
regist
use
microprocessor
circuit
and
back
then
they
were
veri
suscept
to
electrostat
discharg
and
line
nois
the
biggest
problem
came
from
outlet
that
were
not
properli
ground
in
almost
everi
place
we
went
to
do
an
instal
we
found
outlet
with
the
ground
connect
to
the
neutral
for
of
the
thing
you
can
plug
into
one
of
these
they
work
fine
for
our
cash
regist
they
were
a
nightmar
line
nois
tend
to
scrambl
the
memori
period
with
modern
electron
use
switch
power
suppli
thi
should
be
le
of
a
problem
even
the
compani
i
use
to
work
for
is
no
longer
recommend
a
dedic
line
with
a
seper
ground
for
their
equip
i
imagin
if
you
check
most
household
wire
you
will
find
that
the
ground
and
neutral
are
connect
although
not
ideal
it
should
be
ok
for
most
applic
slmr
my
realiti
