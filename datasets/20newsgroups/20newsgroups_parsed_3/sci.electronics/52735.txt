re
help
with
ultralong
time
thank
for
the
respos
a
they
were
all
good
idea
and
i
am
look
at
use
a
coupl
of
the
idea
i
reciev
in
the
mail
today
the
spec
sheet
on
the
mil
spec
version
of
exar
xr
timercount
chip
it
is
stabl
down
to
c
and
suck
veri
littl
power
they
show
an
applic
for
a
ultralong
time
delay
up
to
sever
year
depend
on
the
rc
time
constant
in
thi
applic
they
have
two
of
them
cascad
togeth
the
reset
and
trigger
pin
of
both
chip
are
tie
togeth
and
the
timebas
of
the
second
chip
is
disabl
in
thi
configur
the
output
is
high
when
the
system
is
reset
when
trigger
the
output
goe
low
and
stay
that
way
for
a
total
of
x
the
time
cycl
of
the
first
chip
the
total
time
cycl
of
the
two
chip
can
be
program
from
to
x
r
x
c
to
x
r
x
c
in
step
by
select
ani
combin
of
the
counter
output
to
the
timer
output
the
beauti
of
it
is
the
timebas
chip
would
onli
have
to
have
a
uf
time
cap
and
a
k
resistor
for
second
per
time
cycl
so
i
can
get
a
maximum
of
second
between
time
cycl
x
or
about
day
of
cours
that
much
more
than
i
need
day
but
the
counter
allow
for
binari
step
that
can
be
select
for
the
output
for
the
pellet
puker
after
the
first
day
and
it
trip
it
would
reset
it
self
for
the
next
day
time
cycl
and
so
forth
power
is
still
a
problem
though
a
few
idea
that
you
suggest
wa
to
buri
the
electron
in
a
hole
dug
in
the
snow
a
an
insul
and
put
the
pellet
puker
up
on
a
tower
abov
the
estim
snow
fall
with
a
solar
panel
on
it
to
keep
a
charg
on
a
lithium
batteri
pack
i
like
that
idea
thi
thing
ha
to
work
for
at
least
six
week
for
three
sampl
and
the
ga
valv
are
volt
to
spit
the
pellet
out
onto
the
snow
anyway
i
order
the
xr
to
see
what
i
can
do
with
them
should
be
interest
a
long
a
im
not
the
one
that
ha
to
go
dig
up
the
pellet
in
the
middl
of
antartica
freez
my
bun
off
thank
again
