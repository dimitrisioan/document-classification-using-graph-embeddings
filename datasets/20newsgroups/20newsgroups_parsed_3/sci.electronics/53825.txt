bar
need
i
had
a
similar
idea
for
a
faxansw
machin
switch
to
put
both

on
one
line
you
order
distinct
ring
from
your
phone
compani
thi
is
month
here
you
get
a
second
unpublish
phone
number
when
someon
call
thi
number
your
phone
ring
with
short
ring
instead
of
long
ring
you
set
up
your
answer
machin
on
ring
and
your
fax
on
six
ring
youd
give
out
the
new
a
your
fax
a
devic
would
measur
the
length
of
ring
when
it
detect
a
short
ring
it
turn
off
your
answer
machin
five
ring
later
your
fax
pick
up
the
call
thi
should
be
cheaper
and
more
eleg
than
the
switch
now
avail
but
that
not
what
i
did

give
out
the
new

my
friend
and
custom
thi
should
leav
the
old

wont
pick
up
the
phone
when
i
hear
the
long
ring
whi

thought
