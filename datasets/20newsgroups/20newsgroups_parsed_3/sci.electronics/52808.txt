re
help
with
ultralong
time
in
articl
du
write
i
have
a
project
that
wa
droop
in
my
lap
that
is
somewhat
a
pain
to
design
what
i
am
look
for
is
a
stabl
ultralong
solid
state
timer
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
place
thi
thing
on
the
antart
ice
shelf
and
measur
the
amount
of
snow
fall
over
a
period
of
six
week
everi
two
week
they
want
to
trip
a
selonoid
to
discharg
differ
color
pellet
by
ga
pressur
out
across
the
snow
then
by
dig
down
into
the
snow
the
snow
fall
amount
can
be
measur
a
they
come
to
the
differ
color
pellet
the
problem
is
tri
to
build
a
timer
that
would
stand
the
cold
degre
and
a
power
sourc
that
wouldnt
drain
i
have
look
at
the
xr
timer
and
the
standard
ne
dual
timer
but
thier
temp
spec
wont
go
that
low
also
two
week
equat
to
second
per
fire
which
mean
one
big
time
cap
i
have
found
farad
ye
farad
cap
that
have
a
work
voltag
of
volt
and
are
small
in
size
but
again
the
time
of
discharg
at
or
lower
degre
isnt
linear
i
wa
think
of
use
sever
timer
chain
togeth
to
fire
the
selonid
at
the
end
of
the
time
period
but
that
blast
cold
and
the
drain
on
a
batteri
over
six
week
is
the
pain
one
possibl
would
be
to
use
solar
panel
but
thi
is
dure
the
six
month
twilight
anyon
have
ani
good
idea
thank
in
advanc
we
just
a
suggest
take
a
motorola
mcb
set
it
up
to
give
you
a
pul
onc
everi
sec
or
ten
sec
with
either
a
rc
or
xtal
clock
input
then
feed
to
a
mcb
a
clock
input
and
decod
output
for
sec
output
might
have
to
add
a
few
and
gate
or
decod
chip
to
get
output
and
reset
pul
back
to
the
to
restart
cycl
trigger
a
oneshot
from
the
decod
rise
edg
the
one
shot
then
goe
to
a
mosfet
to
drive
the
mechan
to
fire
the
pellet
launcher
these
ckt
requir
uamp
of
currentbetween
volt
so
a
volt
gel
cell
of
a
few
amphour
would
last
the
six
week
then
take
the
ckt
board
batteri
wrap
in
or
of
foam
or
build
a
box
of
out
of
the
stuffwith
plywood
or
metal
exterior
build
a
small
heater
out
of
watt
resistor
in
seri
to
keep
the
batteri
and
ckt
warm
nd
thought
use
batteri
one
for
heater
one
for
timer
and
pellet
trigger
insolateinsolateeven
though
the
chip
state
that
the
al
rate
devic
are
good
to
c
the
batteri
have
a
consider
reduct
in
capacityoh
make
