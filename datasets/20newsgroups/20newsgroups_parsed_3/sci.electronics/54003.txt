odd

of
resistor
are
often
requir

resistorit
seem
best
to
choos
common

valu
and
cope
with
the
strang

then
demand
is
there
a
pd
program
out
there
that
will
work
out
how
best
to
make
up
such
a
resist
given
fix
resistor
of
the
standard
valu
per
decad
etc
it
is
a
common
enough
problem
yet
i
cant
recal
se
a
program
that
tell
