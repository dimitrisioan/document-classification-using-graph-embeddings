re
decoupl
cap
onboard
ive
use
onchip
capacitor
to
reduc
groundbounc
nois
on
a
small
systol
array
chip
that
had
pf
load
on
the
clock
line
design
wa
in
micron
nwell
cmo
use
the
mosi
scalabl
design
rule
here
are
some
thought
on
the
bypass
capacitor
they
dont
help
much
with
simultan
output
switchingther
is
still
a
larg
induct
between
the
bypass
capacitor
and
the
load
capacitor
on
both
the
signal
line
and
the
ground
return
so
you
still
get
ground
and
power
line
bounc
they
do
help
a
lot
with
onchip
load
a
i
had
with
the
high
load
on
the
clock
line
the
transient
you
are
tri
to
suppress
are
realli
high
frequenc
so
forget
about
larg
area
of
polythinoxidediff
capacitor
sinc
the
rc
time
constant
is
too
larg
what
i
did
is
to
make
a
metal
metal
poli
diff
sandwich
but
put
a
lot
of
hole
in
the
poli
layer
allow
frequent
diffmet
contact
i
forget
exactli
how
wide
the
poli
line
were
if
i
were
do
thi
design
again
id
probabl
omit
the
diff
altogeth
and
use
a
solid
poli
sheet
instead
use
just
m
m
and
poli
and
substrat
but
that
ha
such
a
high
resist
it
can
be
ignor
at
these
speed
you
are
probabl
better
off
tri
to
tune
your
circuit
to
run
with
slightli
slower
edg
and
lower
voltag
swing
especi
for
output
signal
than
spend
chip
area
on
capacitor
i
had
spare
space
on
the
die
sinc
the
circuit
wa
too
big
for
a
mosi
tini
chip
and
the
next
size
up
wa
twice
a
big
a
i
need
kevin
karplu
kevin
karplu
due
to
budgetari
constraint
the

at

end
of
the
