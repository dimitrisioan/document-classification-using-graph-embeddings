i
wa
have
a
look
through
a
coupl
of
compon
catalogu
when
i
came
across
a
rang
of
peltier
effect
heat
pump
intend
for
cool
compon
for
those
who
have
not
heard
of
thi
effect
you
put
a
current
through
one
of
these
devic
and
it
pump
heat
from
one
side
to
the
other
revers
the
current
and
you
revers
the
effect
i
think
a
temperatur
differ
can
give
you
an
emf
a
well
anyway
it
struck
me
that
you
could
make
a
nice
coolhot
box
for
picnic
with
one
of
these
a
power
regul
a
thermostat
and
a
coupl
of
heat
sink
the
biggest
devic
can
shift
w
with
an
effici
of
which
aint
bad
although
it
would
flatten
my
car
batteri
in
about
half
an
hour
socal
coolhot
box
have
been
advetis
for
sever
year
i
recal
damark
advertis
them
in
a
recent
catalog
problem
with
the
unit
is
they
do
a
shi
job
of
keep
food
coldwarm
the
pelit
devic
use
just
dont
seem
to
have
enough
punch
to
keep
up
if
you
want
someth
hot
you
need
to
heat
it
up
befor
you
put
it
in
the
box
and
end
up
hour
later
with
food
that
onli
moder
warm
same
goe
for
cold
item
unfortun
the
catalogu
didnt
list
anyth
more
than
the
basic
spec
a
a
heat
pump
i
imagin
that
you
would
get
a
backemf
a
the
temperatur
gradient
across
the
devic
increas
if
so
presum
it
power
decreas
a
the
backemf
increas
until
eventu
we
have
a
steadi
state
with
no
current
be
consum
assum
no
leakag
if
so
then
the
final
temperatur
differ
between
the
two
side
could
be
set
by
the
suppli
voltag
and
noth
more
although
that
would
be
a
lousi
way
to
control
it
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
are
the
abov
guess
correct
what
is
the
opencircuit
thermal
resist
of
a
typic
devic
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
my
coolbox
is
not
go
to
get
warm
too
fast
when
i
unplug
it
youd
probabl
be
better
off
get
a
good
colemantm
cooler
and
stock
up
on
blue
ice
