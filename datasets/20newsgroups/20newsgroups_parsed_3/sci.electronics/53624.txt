re
a
question
about
vac
outlet
wire
rus
crisp
write
so
here
my
question
it
seem
to
me
that
id
have
the
same
electr
circuit
if
i
hook
a
jumper
from
the
neutral
over
to
the
ground
screw
on
new
three
prong
ground
outlet
what
wrong
with
my
reason
here
may
i
respect
suggest
you
not
do
thi
the
ground
is
suppos
to
be
a
protect
ground
and
though
what
you
suggest
look
good
on
paper
it
danger
to
reli
on
the
same
wire
for
power
and
protect
itd
never
meet
code
and
if
you
now
own
the
properti
and
later
sell
it
you
may
end
up
with
liabil
you
dont
want
and
if
you
dont
now
own
it
well
there
a
wire
faq
that
i
think
address
thi
i
believ
an
altern
is
use
of
a
gfci
but
im
realli
not
sure
what
current
code
allow
in
thi
area
the
gfci
sen
altern
unwant
current
path
and
doesnt
reli
on
a
specif
protect
ground
wire
at
least
not
beyond
the
gfci
in
the
protect
circuit
gfci
breaker
are
avail
but
expens
