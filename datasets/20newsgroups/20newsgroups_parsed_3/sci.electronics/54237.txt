digitalac
scale
be
in
the
visual
stage
of
a
circuit
design
right
now
i
wa
wonder
what
the
best
way
to
scale
an
ac
voltag
use
an
bit
digit
word
is
i
am
think
of
use
the
common
method
of
send
the
word
through
an
adc
and
then
compar
it
with
the
ac
voltag
convert
to
a
sawtooth
wave
to
get
a
duti
cycl
howev
i
am
leari
of
thi
method
becaus
it
a
requir
a
lot
of
part
and
more
importantli
b
creat
a
lot
of
interfer
from
the
switch
on
the
entir
ac
line
i
realiz
that
correct
filter
could
cancel
out
most
of
thi
interfer
but
that
would
requir
more
part
and
boost
the
price
further
someon
mention
to
me
that
they
had
seen
an
ic
which
input
bit
of
data
and
directli
scale
the
ac
voltag
come
in
all
onchip
unfortun
he
couldnt
rememb
the
chip
number
or
the
manufactur
if
anyon
el
ha
heard
of
thi
chip
plea
email
me
i
am
build
thi
project
a
a
dimmer
box
for
a
light
control
circuit
and
it
is
import
that
the
cost
of
each
box
remain
veri
low
becaus
one
dimmer
is
requir
for
each
light
