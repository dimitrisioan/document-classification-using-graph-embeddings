re
flash
led
with
sound
in
articl
there
a
seeker
born
everi
minut
write
would
it
be
better
to
use
a
circuit
base
on
the
volum
of
the
beep
on
the
cassett
or
better
for
the
led
to
respond
to
a
tone
of
a
certain
frequenc
is
there
ani
easi
way
to
do
either
of
these
im
look
for
the
simplest
circuit
possibl
i
guess
what
im
ask
for
is
some
sort
of
color
organ
but
not
quit
let
me
trt
to
explain
again
look
for
inform
about
tone
decod
chip
it
is
an
easi
to
use
chip
for
detect
sound
of
certain
frequenc
you
need
onli
one
and
some
other
componet
for
each
led
you
want
to
control
the
chip
can
take
the
voltag
level
which
the
casett
give
radio
shack
archer
semiconductor
refer
guid
give
good
inform
how
to
use
that
chip
it
should
be
simplest
way
to
go
the
chip
cost
someth
like
loweri
law
if
it
jam
forc
it
if
it
break
it
need
replac
anyway
