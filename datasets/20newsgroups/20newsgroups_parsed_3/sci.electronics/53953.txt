told
with
the

be
pipe
into
a

im
not
sure
if

but
larg
multicolor
statu
display

statu
to
those

incandesc
display
board
along

stretch
to
provid
commut
with

a
a
pilot
program
and
inform
from
it
will
be
avail
free
of
charg
perhap
the
la
system
is
similarli
free

at
an
obvious
subsid
rate
read
cheap
we
also
have
the
traffic
report
that
are
broadcast
on
the
sap
audio
channel
of
televis
channel
and
these
are
verbal
report
qualifi
with
a
identif
tone
to
tell
invehicl
receiv
like
the
auto
talk
that
the
inform
come
next
is
applic
to
a
given

theyr
probabl
use

the
concept
is
the

tri
set

without
have
to
incur
monthli

sinc
the
maker
of
these
invehicl
receiv
dont
have
to
pay
for
the

thi
may
not
be
complet
true
