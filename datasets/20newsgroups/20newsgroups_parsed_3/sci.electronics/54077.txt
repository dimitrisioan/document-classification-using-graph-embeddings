i
hate
hard
copi
manual
and
would
rather
have
all
doc
onlin
not
becaus
i
want
to
copi
the
program
but
becaus
it
usual
faster
and
and
conveni
than
sift
through
an
old
book
i
cant
find
just
mho
but
i
prefer
hardcopi
book
becaus
you
can
have
three
or
four
of
them
open
spread
across
the
bed
next
to
the
desk
in
my
dorm
and
refer
them
while
use
the
program
fullscreen
the
window
help
thing
come
closest
to
good
onlin
document
ive
seen
but
they
gener
arent
detail
enough
and
would
probabl
take
a
larg
amount
of
space
even
compress
which
is
at
a
premium
on
my
system
in
fact
the
manual
are
the
primari
reason
i
bought
borland
c
compil
instead
of
use
the
one
the
lab
licens
in
the
lab
of
cours
ive
got
a
shelf
full
of
book
to
help
me
out
when
im
stuck
to
each
hi
own
agre
person
i
can
not
flip
from
page
to
page
on
a
screen
and
retain
inform
a
easili
a
in
the
written
page
off
deeper
end
whi
doe
everyon
think
they
need
to
be
abl
to
make
a
backup
copi
almost
all
new
softwar
must
be
instal
to
the
hard
disk
so
you
are
left
with
the
origin
a
your
backup
i
think
it
a
wast
of
time
space
and
money
a
well
a
it
make
it
to
tempt
to
lend
out
the
backup
weve
destroy
about
six
set
of
origin
microsoft
word
for
mac
and
word
for
window
may
have
been
a
bad
batch
of
disk
dont
have
the
faintest
idea
what
happen
to
them
they
just
went
bad
werent
store
near
ani
magnet
field
or
otherwis
mistreat
inde
they
were
onli
use
onc
given
thi
and
the
massiv
headach
find
a
work
set
of
disk
to
fix
some
of
the
machin
that
period
go
down
id
say
have
work
backup
is
a
godsend
i
sure
wish
wed
had
them
sometim
i
think
murphi
law
hold
true
more
often
than
newton
when
we
need
them
i
think
it
sortof
like
snake
antivenin
of
the
time
you
have
absolut
no
use
for
it
but
when
you
need
it
boy
do
you
ever
need
it
ditto
in
fact
at
work
where
thing
are
dead
if
the
backup
is
no
good
i
insist
on
have
at
least
a
level
backup
system
it
seem
that
whenev
you
have
good
backup
you
never
need
them
but
if
you
dont
have
them
murphi
guarante
that
youll
suffer
for
it
i
dont
have
backup
of
my
origin
at
home
but
then
my
machin
doesnt
see
anywher
near
the
useabus
of
these
here
at
the
lab
and
so
i
consid
it
le
of
a
risk
still
i
usual
make
work
copi
of
them
when
i
instal
them
and
then
eventu
reus
these
work
copi
for
someth
els
no
flame
intend
just
my
thought
just
mine
too
and
mine
