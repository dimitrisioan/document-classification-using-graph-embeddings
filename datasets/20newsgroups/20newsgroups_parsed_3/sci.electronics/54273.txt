such

that

be
a
great
idea
if
each

made
avail
to
the
public
an
anonym
ftp
site
with
all
it
data
book
in
the
form
of

ala
rfc
style
thi
would
save
time
and
money
for
the
ic
manufactur
sinc
a
text
file
cost
noth
to
send
around
the
world
via
internet
and
sinc
most
user
of

are
found
in
the

anyway
are
there
ani

avail

a
possibl
or
am
i
go
to
be
stuck
obtain
a
zillion
databook
from
the
manufactur
those
littl
phonebooktyp
book
that
are
obsolet
everi
coupl
year
we
use
a
cdrom
base
system
here
there
are
about
cdrom
disk
and
a
disk
changer
hook
to
a
dedic
msdo
comput
it
contain
scan
imag
of
data
book
page
for
sever
thousand
part
when
you
ask
it
for
someth
it
know
about
mostli
activ
ic
part
it
work
quit
well
they
dont
handl
all
the
varieti
of
transistor
or
diod
that
exist
it
is
defin
a
start
in
the
right
direct
but
they
need
to
expand
the
data
base
to
handl
more
type
of
stuff
these
system
arent
cheap
we
paid
about
for
the
liscenc
and
get
monthli
updat
of
some
of
the
cdrom
disk
we
send
the
old
one
back
to
them
so
that
they
will
keep
send
u
the
updat
i
think
we
pay
a
yearli
maintain
fee
of
about
to
get
the
updat
if
you
find
the
part
you
want
you
can
look
at
the
data
sheet
on
a
pages
monitor
it
a
special
monitor
from
sigmasystem
you
can
also
print
each
page
of
the
datasheet
you
want
on
a
laserjet
printer
page
print
take
a
coupl
of
minut
per
page
it
can
take
a
while
to
dump
the
or
page
you
usual
need
i
have
a
feel
the
maker
wouldnt
like
it
if
we
made
the
data
avail
to
all
internet
