re
microcontrol
question
for
newcom
doe
anyon
have
recommend
on
whether
a
smart
data
io
print
spooler
digit
sampl
etc
would
be
better
implement
with
a
dma
chip
or
a
dedic
microcontrol
essenti
what
i
am
tri
to
decid
is
the
best
way
to
handl
move
data
from
a
port
with
automat
handshak
from
or
to
a
memori
area
that
will
be
access
by
a
main
system
processor
when
not
in
use
by
the
smart
data
io
which
dma
or
microcontrol
chip
would
be
best
to
use
fast
cheap
and
easi
to
obtain
would
be
nice
but
i
wont
limit
my
choic
to
onli
those
that
fit
those
characterist
even
an
under
would
do
what
i
want
but
i
am
sure
there
is
a
better
altern
like
a
microcontrol
with
onchip
eeprom
so
i
essenti
want
to
hear
about
all
dma
and
microcontrol
that
are
simpl
to
interfac
and
will
move
data
from
one
place
to
anoth
while
monitor
