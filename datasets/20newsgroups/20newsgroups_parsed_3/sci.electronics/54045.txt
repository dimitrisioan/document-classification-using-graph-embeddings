i
wa
just
wonder
one
thing
actual
two
i
hope
that
thi
is
the
proper
place
to
post
thi
subject
whi
doe
a
lead
acid
batteri
discharg
and
becom
dead
total
unus
when
store
on
a
concret
floor
i
decid
to
bring
the
batteri
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycl
from
the
unheat
garag
thi
year
to
preserv
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
notic
that
not
onli
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
termin
are
short
i
ask
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
caus
it
ruin
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
whi
thank
i
am
not
a
batteri
expert
but
from
recent
read
a
lead
acid
batteri
will
self
discharg
at
a
rel
high
rate
and
if
store
in
a
discharg
state
will
develop
a
condit
i
think
is
call
sulfat
in
storag
either
the
electrolyt
should
be
remov
and
replac
for
use
fat
chanc
id
ever
do
that
at
home
or
the
batteri
should
be
store
on
a
trickl
charg
i
have
also
i
think
read
that
the
condit
may
be
revers
if
hook
up
to
a
current
limit
charg
circuit
fro
a
long
period
of
time
the
refernc
i
rememb
is
to
use
c
where
c
is
the
amp
hour
a
the
charg
circuit
and
leav
it
hook
up
for
week
some
of
thi
may
onli
appli
to
gel
type
cell
but
i
suspect
the
same
appli
to
the
liquid
type
