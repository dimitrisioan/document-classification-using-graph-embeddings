re
adc
card
for
comput
in
articl
you
say
i
would
like
to
digit
the
output
of
a
squid
magnetomet
rang
v
to
v
and
do
digit
signal
process
in
a
comput
say
a
macintosh
ii
or
a
pc
i
would
like
a
good
bit
adc
with
good
linear
and
a
high
convers
speed
at
least
khz
prefer
khz
other
concern
must
i
use
an
adc
extern
to
my
comput
to
avoid
digit
nois
feedback
into
my
sensit
squid
electron
might
be
a
good
idea
the
resolut
you
request
is
about
mv
in
order
to
get
what
youv
paid
for
nois
level
better
be
lower
than
that
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
do
it
in
a
noisi
box
like
you
can
expect
insid
a
pc
befor
you
pay
for
a
pc
card
test
it
out
by
sampl
a
low
distort
sine
wave
i
think
there
is
a
sine
wave
on
a
cd
digit
domain
there
are
possibl
other
low
thd
sourc
run
the
digit
waveform
through
a
fft
transform
and
take
alook
at
the
nois
floor
on
the
spectrum
that
should
give
you
a
good
indic
of
the
design
that
what
i
am
do
to
test
a
data
acquist
system
i
have
design
i
got
the
idea
from
maxim
data
sheet
if
you
can
live
with
bit
resolut
i
would
recommend
look
at
the
max
from
maxim
it
is
a
high
speed
khz
complet
sampl
ad
with
dsp
interfac
the
input
rang
is
v
and
it
use
a
serial
interfac
which
can
easili
be
optic
isol
from
the
comput
to
elinim
a
major
nois
sourc
the
analog
design
guid
i
got
from
them
show
a
db
nois
level
they
claim
a
db
max
typ
thd
look
pretti
good
for
the
piec
a
evalu
kit
is
avail
might
want
to
give
these
nice
folk
a
call
or
fax
and
ext
for
applic
assist
thi
assum
that
you
can
build
your
own
da
and
write
your
own
softwar
hey
you
can
get
the
max
a
a
free
sampl
just
by
call
the
i
would
appreci
discus
of
your
person
experi
with
a
mac
or
pc
base
adc
system
i
would
recommend
you
to
find
out
the
resolut
that
can
be
gotten
out
of
your
system
by
look
at
the
nois
level
otherwis
you
might
be
throw
out
your
money

i
have

except
i
do
in

recommend
compani
that
give

to
