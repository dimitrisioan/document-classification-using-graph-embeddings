re
want
a
to
d
hardwar
for
a
pc
in
brad
wright
write
if
you
know
much
about
pc
ibm
comp
you
might
tri
the
joystick
port
though
i
havent
tri
thi
myself
ive
been
told
that
the
port
ha
built
in
ad
convert
thi
would
allow
the
joystick
to
be
a
coupl
of
pot
if
you
could
find
the
spec
thi
might
just
work
for
you
i
believ
that
the
ad
convert
found
on
a
joystick
port
are
realli
timer
that
tick
off
how
long
it
take
an
rc
circuit
the
r
be
your
paddl
to
charg
up
to
someth
like
vcc
for
game
thi
work
pretti
well
but
you
certainli
wouldnt
want
to
tri
to
take
lab
measur
off
someth
a
nonlinear
a
that
hmm
i
suppos
you
could
linear
it
in
softwar
but
the
real
problem
is
that
the
precis
of
your
measur
is
no
longer
constant
higher
voltag
would
be
more
precis
on
the
other
hand
i
could
be
wrong
and
perhap
the
game
card
design
splurg
for
the
extra
to
make
a
cheap
constant
current
sourc
out
of
an
op
amp
but
i
wouldnt
expect
that
