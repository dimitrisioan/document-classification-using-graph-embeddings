have
been
success
for
a
time
i
recal
howev
near
monthli
releas
of
new
way
to
crack
the
copi
protect
scheme
of
the
latest
releas
the
fact
is
none
of
them
are
complet
secur
or
anywher
near
it
some
are
more
or
le
difficult
to
crack
and
some
have
alreadi
been
crack
i
guess
what
i
am
say
is
that
your
question
is
difficult
if
not
imposs
to
answer
what
exactli
do
you
want
to

assum
the
activ
is
strictli
legal
in
gener
it
is
a
bad
idea
legal
to
tamper
with

it
can
also
lead

do
you

are
mere
curiou
plea
clear
up
those
question
and
ill

of
the
dread
anyon

of
which
includ
break
the
law
or
at

address
it
from

side
or
the

matt
i
have
written
a
program
and
i
want
to
market
it
i
would
like
certain
degre
of
protect
sinc
my
main
custmer
are
individu
and
not
the
cooper
i
know
laser
hole
burn
method
and
hardwar
key
method
howev
my
softwar
is
go
to
cost
onli
so
i
can
not
afford
that
also
at
thi
low
price
i
can
not
afford
peopl
make
too
mani
copi
of
my
softwar
well
i
guess
say
upto
illig
copi
is
ok
by
me
howev
i
do
not
want
someon
to
get
a
copi
of
pctool
and
copi
my
softwar
off
cours
i
never
meant
to
forbid
the
true
hacker
from
copi
sinc
they
can
develop
a
better
program
anyway
with
highest
regard
babak
sehari
one
of
the
most
popular
method
of
cours
is
the
password
check
where
they
ask
you
for
a
word
from
page
x
line
y
and
word
z
but
thi
is
piti
simpl
to
remov
unless
you
throw
some
checksum
into
the
main
part
of
your
program
and
some
selfrewrit
code
to
confus
some
peopl
also
make
sure
that
your
program
can
not
be
run
out
a
debugg
anoth
method
of
cours
is
to
not
even
make
bad
sector
on
the
origin
disk
just
write
a
certain
key
to
a
certain
unalloc
sector
to
help
you
here
you
also
must
do
the
code
protect
scheme
mention
in
the
first
paragraph
make
sure
you
also
fill
the
rest
of
the
unalloc
part
of
the
disk
with
garbag
a
well
or
they
wan
na
be
cracker
can
just
look
for
the
junk
in
some
random
sector
like
you
mention
there
are
the
laser
hole
disk
and
hardwar
key
but
they
are
both
expens
and
a
pain
in
the
butt
for
the
endus
which
you
is
the
opposit
of
what
you
want
anoth
configur
that
can
be
use
is
to
save
the
configur
of
the
machin
that
it
is
be
instal
to
in
the
most
undecipher
format
you
can
think
of
if
the
program
doe
not
find
that
thi
is
the
same
system
it
request
be
instal
by
the
origin
disk
again
the
origin
disk
should
be
encrypt
compact
have
mani
sector
that
should
be
check
and
anyth
el
you
can
think
of
to
make
sure
that
the
origin
can
not
be
copi
onc
again
you
must
put
codeencrypt
selfrewrit
code
and
multipl
crc
check
in
the
program
to
make
sure
that
it
doe
not
get
chang
among
other
thing
thi
also
protect
your
program
from
virii
if
the
program
detect
a
chang
in
it
code
tell
the
user
that
a
viru
ha
been
detect
in
the
program
tell
them
the
program
is
viru
secur
and
rememb
you
have
help
the
world
kill
some
pirat
and
kill
some
virus
feel
good
i
hope
that
i
have
help
have
fun
knock
some
crack
out
well
you
cant
do
it
everyth
that
can
be
written
can
be
crack
but
youll
pissem
off
in
the
process
