robert

carpent
write
im
wonder
if
it
possibl
to
use
radio
wave
to
measur
the
distanc
between
a
transmitt
and
receiv
ye
you
could
seem
to
me
that
you
should
be
abl
to
measur
the
signal
strength
and
determin
distanc
thi
would
be
for
short
distanc
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuraci
of
inch
or
so
well
letse
whip
out
hpsx
soon
to
be
gx
inch
m
nanosecond
resolut
hmm
thatll
be
rather
difficult
the
more
standard
read
better
method
is
to
use
ultrasound
gener
somewher
around
khz
sound
travel
a
heck
of
a
lot
slower
than
light
radio
wave
and
is
therefor
much
easier
to
deal
with
what
frequenc
would
be
best
for
thi
or
doe
matter
it
might
be
easiest
to
visit
a
hardwar
store
and
look
at
the
numer
sonic
estim
type
devic
that
do
what
you
want
here
mani
are
pretti
cheap
too
in
fact
for
awhil
the
stanley
estim
wa
sell
for
someth
like
