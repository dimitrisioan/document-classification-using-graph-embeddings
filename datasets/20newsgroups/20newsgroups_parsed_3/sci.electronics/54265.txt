write

earlier
articl
kasey
chang
wrote
noth
but
if
you
read
my
whole
suggest
im
say
that
you
regist
via
mail
by
mail
in
your
registr
card
then
the
compani
send
you
the
patch
which
includ
the
info
you
put
on
the
registr
card
the
problem
with
thi
scheme
is
that
when
i
buy
a
game
i
want
to
play
it
that
daymail
a
card
to
and
from
california
would
probabl
take
a
week
or
more
i
didnt
say
the
program
is
disabl
did
i
i
hate
it
when
peopl
take
my
word
out
of
context
i
mean
that
onc
you
have
instal
it
you
can
not
deinstal
it
without
regist
it
or
transfer
it
to
anoth
machin
or
some
sort
of
limit
the
author
will
decid
which
will
be
remov
when
the
program
is
regist
what
you
cant
remov
it
unless
you
regist
you
got
ta
be
joke
right
what
happen
if
i
get
a
demovers
of
that
program
instal
it
and
then
decid
that
i
dont
like
it
do
i
have
to
regist
to
be
abl
to
get
rid
of
it
hell
no
that
is
the
last
thing
i
would
think
of
if
that
is
what
you
mean
then
you
would
better
make
pretti
sure
that
a
statement
to
that
effect
is
print
loud
and
clear
on
the
packag
a
better
way
to
implement
the
abov
mention
scheme
is
imho
to
allow
anyon
to
instal
the
program
but
if
they
regist
they
get
some
addit
featur
enabl
it
could
mean
onli
one
new
exe
file
need
to
be
copi
to
have
got
the
fullvers
of
the
program
of
cours
anyon
is
free
to
delet
or
remov
that
program
at
whatev
time
they
like
still
we
face
the
troubl
of
move
the
new
exe
file
around
that
could
be
solv
by
have
the
user
regist
him
self
and
get
back
a
special
mark
for
him
or
her
a
new
exe
file
a
for
some
sort
of
limit
here
are
some
suggest
limit
the
size
of
data
that
the
program
can
work
with
disabl
save
the
data
print
it
out
with
some
defect
in
the
output
but
be
sure
to
mark
them
a
such
let
some
popup
screen
appear
for
ca
sec
when
the
program
is
start
andor
exit
etc
but
dont
have
it
that
you
must
regist
to
be
abl
to
remov
it
