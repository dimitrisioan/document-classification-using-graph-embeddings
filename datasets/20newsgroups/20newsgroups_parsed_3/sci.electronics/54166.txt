suggest
on
a
problem

have
sever

whose
sole
purpos
is
to
decod
dtmf
tone
and
send
the
result
in
ascii
to
a
pc
these
board
run
on
the
serial
interfac
i
need
to
run
of
the
board
somwehat
simultan
i
need
to
be
abl
to
ho
ok
them
up
to
a
pc
the
problem
is
how
do
i
hook
up
serial
devic
to
one
pc
inexpensivley
so
that
all
can
send
data
simulatan
or
close
to
it
ani
help
would
be
greatli
appreci
are
the
board
at
all
intellig
ie
run
by
microcontrol
the
easiest
thing
would
be
to
have
anoth
line
that
say
that
one
of
the
board
is
talk
to
the
pc
when
thi
line
wa
true
the
other
board
could
all
hold
off
and
not
send
their
data
thi
isnt
a
perfect
solut
though
sinc
you
have
to
worri
a
littl
about
make
sure
two
board
dont
decid
to
talk
at
the
exact
same
time
other
than
that
i
think
you
will
need
to
hook
up
each
board
to
someth
that
speak
r
thi
actual
isnt
a
hard
or
a
expens
a
it
use
to
be
though
assum
the
board
talk
rel
slowli
bp
or
slower
the
pic
can
coordin
thing
between
themselv
to
multiplex
the
data
thi
is
realli
just
forbicli
ad
the
suggest
in
the
first
paragraph
to
your
system
and
it
assum
that
each
board
doesnt
talk
more
than
th
of
the
time
of
for
veri
long
sinc
a
pic
isnt
go
to
be
abl
to
buffer
more
than
mayb
some
byte
you
might
want
to
check
into
the
price
of
