it
seem
reason
to
me
that
a
microwav
transmitterreceiv
setup
could
do
the
job
for
exampl
say
you
want
to
map
an
acr
lot
itd
be
conveni
to
place
mw
transmitt
around
the
lot
peripheri
either
or
and
then
carri
a
handheld
record
and
walk
to
a
point
on
the
lot
press
a
button
and
the
coord
of
the
record
locat
is
store
a
digit
data
what
the
chanc
of
thi
work
ani
system
like
thi
alreadi
exist
what
kind
of
accuraci
could
you
expect
what
would
someth
like
thi
cost
to
prototyp
is
there
a
better
altern
than
microwav
of
cours
you
could
develop
thi
system
but
there
is
alreadi
a
system
call
global
posit
satellit
it
give
three
dimension
coordin
anywher
on
earth
mani
surveyor
use
thi
system
with
a
differenti
receivertransmitt
to
get
coordin
within
centimet
basic
receiv
with
resolut
of
a

on

that
the
wonder
thing
about
crayon
they
can
take
you
to
more
place
than
a
starship
can
guinon
thought
it
mean
global
posit
system
there
are
two
precis
level
one
for
armi
applic
kill
ha
to
be
veri
accur
today
and
one
for
civil
one
the
civil
precis
is
about
to
m
correct
me
if
im
wrong
though
it
may
be
insuffici
for
map
build
but
there
is
a
way
with
an
addit
refer
point
eg
one
fix
gp
system
in
a
hous
to
get
the
same
high
precis
a
the
militari
version
but
it
get
pretti
complic
then
if
you
use
a
microwav
system
actual
thi
mean
some
type
of
radar
you
need
quit
a
lot
of
number
crunch
to
get
accur
vector
data
out
of
your
origin
signal
so
the
gp
system
seem
to
be
the
better
and
run
idea
for
your
applicationther
have
been
discus
in
