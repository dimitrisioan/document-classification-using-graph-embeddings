almost
ani

it
would
be
greatli
appreci
if

paul
unfortun
there
are
not
too
mani
retail
outlet
thatll
stock
just
about
everi
chip
made
the
stuff
they
will
stock
are
the
one
thatll
sell
like
standard
dram
s
s
etcetc
ie
i
cnat
think
of
ani
onestopshop
store
the
closest
you
can
get
is
to
pick
up
a
copi
of
byte
magazin
or
the
circuit
cellar
popular
electron
and
the
like
and
flip
through
them
distributor
like
wyle
electron
hamilton
avnet
pioneer
electron
etc
etc
dont
normal
deal
with
endus
like
ourselv
where
we
onli
a
coupl
of
everythingthey
onli
deal
with
peopl
who
buy
by
the
hundr
or
more
each
distributor
repres
and
sell
a
varieti
of
differ
noncompet
manufactur
what
do
i
mean
by
thi
suppos
abc
electron
sell
intel
s
it
a
pretti
good
bet
that
they
wont
be
sell
ani
of
amd
s
or
viceversa
they
also
can
obtain
just
about
ani
chip
you
want
from
a
manufactur
they
repres
who
know
you
might
be
lucki
to
be
abl
to
buy
from
one
of
them
but
id
be
supris
if
you
do
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
or
qti
price
they
will
charg
you
will
be
much
greater
than
what
a
mail
order
outlet
will
charg
my
advic
if
your
gon
na
be
design
anyth
tri
to
stick
with
offtheshelf

your
go
to
get
stuck
if
you
