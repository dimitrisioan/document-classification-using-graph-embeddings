victoria
milliron
say
a
possibl
for
the
softwar
registr
conondrum
would
be
to
have
the
distributor
regist
the
copi
when
the
softwar
wa
sold
the
clerk
stick
it
that
kind
of
extra
work
that
one
can
not
expect
the
store
peopl
to
do
imho
it
would
be
easier
if
compani
sell
their
softwar
a
cheapli
a
possibl
and
to
sell
the
custom
detail
manual
for
the
braindead

video
paid
support
hot

part
of
their
packag
i
have
seen
mani
book
to
teach
peopl
how
to
use
do
wp
and
other
softwar
i
i
suspect
either
user
cant
read
the
manual
or
they
dont
have
manual
either
way
there
is
to
be
made
btw
book
are

secur
key
i
havent
use
anyth
that
had
hardwar
key
copi
protect
scheme
so
i
dont
know
what
