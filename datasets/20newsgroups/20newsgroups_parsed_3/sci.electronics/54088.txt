write
i
built
a
littl
project
use
the
radio
shack
vdc
relay
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretti
bad
click
when
the
thing
switch
i
wa
do
most
of
the
common
thing
one
is
suppos
to
do
when
use
relay
and
noth
seem
to
get
rid
of
the
click
my
question
is
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switch
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
nois
of
ani
kind
on
the
audio
line
i
will
appreci
ani
advic
or
refer
to
advic
also
exact
part
numberscompani
name
etc
for
the
relay
will
help
the
first
step
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
dc
compon
intent
or
not
on
the
audio
line
to
be
switch
if
neither
the
output
or
input
present
an
unintent
dc
level
let
say
theyr
capacit
coupl
then
put
a
k
resistor
from
each
input
to
ground
and
from
the
output
to
ground
is
a
good
precaut
against
leakag
in
ani
coupl
cap
present
a
dc
level
that
is
guarante
to
caus
a
click
if
the
devic
present
an
unintent
dc
level
that
is
from
more
than
just
coupl
capacitor
leakag
then
you
need
to
remov
the
dc
befor
switch
with
coupl
capacitor
of
your
own
if
you
have
more
than
one
relay
each
relay
switch
one
input
through
to
a
common
output
you
can
use
makebeforebreak
switch
where
for
a
brief
instant
both
sourc
are
connect
dure
a
switch
chang
thi
may
mask
the
switch
click
an
audio
switch
that
is
clickless
is
made
by
take
a
light
bulb
and
make
your
own

you
might
want
to
tri
for
a
simpl
solid
state
clickless
switch
that
is
cheap
you
might
tri
look
at
the
cd
analog
switch
that
is
commonli
avail
or
it
older
predecessor
the
again
the
dc
compon
must
be
remov
prior
to

other
altern
includ

both
discret

work

well
