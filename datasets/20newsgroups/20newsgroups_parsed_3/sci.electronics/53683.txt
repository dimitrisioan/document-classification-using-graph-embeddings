what
to
do
with
old
k
simm
daniel
j
rubin
write
how
hard
would
it
be
to
somehow
interfac
them
to
some
of
the
popular
motorola
microcontrol
i
am
a
novic
at
microcontrol
but
i
am
start
to
get
into
them
for
some
of
my
project
i
have
sever
k
simm
lay
around
from
upgrad
mac
and
if
i
could
use
them
a
free
memori
in
one
or
two
of
my
project
that
would
be
great
one
project
that
come
to
mind
is
a
caller
id
devic
that
would
requir
quit
a
bit
of
ram
to
store
sever
hunder
cid
record
etc
assum
hc
in
expand
mux
mode
you
could
do
it
much
easier
if
you
get
a
dram
control
ic
the
mmi
could
be
use
to
implement
thi
or
you
could
use
a
counter
and
a
huge
multiplex
to
provid
rowcolumnrefresh
address
multiplex
the
thing
with
dram
is
that
they
requir
wierd
time
address
multiplex
and
refresh
actual
if
you
want
to
use
a
ic
you
could
look
at
an
which
ha
a
neat
control
built
in
there
is
also
the
xx
i
think
one
of
those
ha
the
dram
control
built
in
thi
one
is
for
the
dram
howev
the
ha
onli
one
more
address
line
ad
onli
anoth
compon
or
so
the
k
simm
are
basic
or
dram
chip
or
their
equival
in
fewer
packag
it
can
be
done
just
take
a
bit
of
logic
design
im
actual
about
to
do
it
use
a
cp
chip
ive
got
k
simm
that
megabyt
on
my
appl
e
use
to
be
in
my
