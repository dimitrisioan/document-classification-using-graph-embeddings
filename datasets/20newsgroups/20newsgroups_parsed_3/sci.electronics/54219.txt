write
stuff
about
hardwar
key
if
you
put
anoth
comput
on
the
port
instead
of
the
key
you
can
hack
them
by
read
what
happen
so
ive
been
told
ive
never
seen
thi
done
but
i
think
it
possibl
youd
need
some
hardwar
knowledg
and
some
softwar
to
read
the
port
true
which
is
whi
mani
of
the
newer
key
ship
out
oh
mayb
bit
or
so
have
the
key
encrypt
them
and
return
them
to
the
pc
make
a
bunch
of
these
bit
part
of
your
program
code
is
a
good
way
to
make
sure
thing
wont
run
without
the
key
anyway
then
thi
scheme
at
least
defeat
your
approach
it
a
littl
costli
though
person
i
dont
believ
in
copi
protect
and
agre
with
the
thought
that
the
mass
inconveni
that
it
caus
all
legal
user
far
outweigh
the
gain
from
what
few
pirat
wont
be
abl
to
