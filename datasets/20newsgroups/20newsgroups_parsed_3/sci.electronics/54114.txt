re
how
to
the
disk
copi
protect
in
articl
steve
madsen
write
backup
if
restor
to
the
same
machin
depend
on
the
programm
dont
use
a
disk
drive
characterist
if
the
user
did
an
upgrad
to
the
machin
hesh
should
reinstal
all
program
ani
way
no
document
lookup
no
disk
wearandtear
thi
is
not
a
good
idea
i
upgrad
my
motherboard
last
fall
i
would
have
been
quit
piss
at
ani
softwar
that
would
have
forc
me
to
reinstal
simpli
becaus
i
chang
motherboard
opinion
is
understand
i
assum
you
have
a
tape
drive
not
all
of
u
have
about
floppi
around
for
backup
you
know
ani
info
in
the
bio
is
too
volatil
to
use
a
a
checksum
are
you
go
to
requir
that
a
user
reinstal
all
their
softwar
if
they
add
mb
of
ram
to
their
comput
i
did
that
a
coupl
of
week
ago
it
in
the
bio
and
if
softwar
had
told
me
thi
isnt
the
machin
you
instal
me
on
i
would
never
have
use
that
softwar
again
realli
bad
idea
ram
is
someth
you
add
all
the
time
so
no
it
more
like
bio
manufactur
andor
processor
type
etc
data
can
not
be
use
esp
with
these
new
flash
rom
bio
machin
with
updat
on
a
diskett
on
the
other
hand
to
make
thi
le
intrus
it
could
be
disguis
a
pleas
insert
origin
disk
xx
a
i
need
file
yyyyyi
for
updat
it
would
be
perfectli
reason
sort
of
i
did
not
say
that
the
origin
would
allow
onli
one
instal
the
user
conscienc
should
do
that
thi
is
silli
it
much
easier
to
loan
disk
to
a
friend
and
let
them
do
an
instal
than
to
backup
your
copi
alreadi
on
disk
and
then
give
them
that
your
scheme
isnt
go
to
stop
anyon
of
cours
it
is
easier
are
you
say
then
the
origin
should
allow
onli
one
instal
what
is
your
point
you
know
how
mani
byte
you
need
to
chang
in
xwing
to
disabl
the
quiz
two
ye
two
and
dont
ask
me
which
one
they
are
do
you
know
ani
assembl
languag
at
all
all
anyon
need
to
do
if
find
the
part
of
the
code
that
doe
the
quiz
and
insert
a
jmp
instruct
to
just
complet
skip
it
not
that
difficult
realli
and
there
is
veri
littl
that
commpani
can
do
to
stop
thi
type
of
thing
use
pklite
or
some
similar
util
would
help
but
onli
if
the
result
compress
exe
were
tag
a
uncompress
i
know
x
and
x
assembl
quit
well
thank
you
i
know
exactli
which
two
byte
need
to
be
chang
i
have
the
code
to
do
them
too
i
just
said
dont
ask
me
which
one
i
didnt
say
i
dont
know
what
that
mean
such
hack
can
be
easili
discourag
by
ad
antipatch
code
which
doe
a
selfcheck
upon
execut
and
refus
to
load
if
crc
doe
not
match
valu
store
encrypt
of
cours
in
the
program
it
could
be
claim
a
a
part
of
antiviru
code
and
it
would
not
be
far
from
the
truth
what
i
believ
the
compani
should
do
is
implement
the
abov
plu
a
special
patch
onc
the
user
regist
that
loudli
exclaim
upon
bootup
regist
to
xxxxx
address
citi
state
zip
and
disabl
the
abov
thi
is
by
far
the
best
idea
you
present
in
your
post
make
it
plainli
obviou
who
regist
is
go
to
stop
casual
pirat
but
the
determin
one
are
just
go
to
answer
joe
blow
to
the
question
of
what
your
name
so
thi
wont
stop
them
in
the
long
run
did
anyon
read
what
i
wrote
that
is
not
what
i
wrote
or
meant
what
i
said
wa
the
program
should
have
certain
restrict
such
a
the
restricttoonemachin
until
the
program
is
regist
with
the
manufactur
the
manufactur
will
then
suppli
the
thenprovenlegitimateus
with
a
patch
that
will
disabl
the
restrict
and
proudli
proclaim
the
legal
copi
with
the
regist
to
xxx
screen
pirat
are
alway
go
to
win
thi
fight
they
simpli
have
more
time
to
work
on
the
softwar
and
figur
out
the
protect
scheme
of
cours
they
will
but
that
wa
not
my
point
the
purpos
of
copi
protect
is
to
discourag
casual
pirat
oh
can
i
have
a
copi
of
thatsur
here
and
the
le
sophist
pirat
let
look
for
all
those
call
to
inth
ani
one
determin
enough
to
break
copi
protect
can
and
will
succeed
they
can
alway
backtrac
the
entir
loadsequ
of
the
program
the
point
of
copi
protect
is
to
make
such
attempt
take
a
long
a
possibl
while
not
intrud
upon
the
us
or
to
minim
such
intrus
of
legitim
use
pirat
who
see
copi
protect
a
a
challeng
love
break
them
and
no
amount
of
copi
protect
will
stop
them
but
the
rest
of
u
will
be
stop
how
mani
of
these
hardcor
pirat
are
there
compar
to
rest
of
u
not
that
mani
kasey
chang
