john
hawkinson
write
one
other
thing
a
friend
of
mine
mention
someth
about
nearuv
light
be
cheaper
to
get
at
than
actual
uv
light
doe
anyon
know
what
he
wa
refer
to
i
dont
want
to
get
into
a
semant
argument
but
contrari
to
some
other
post
near
uv
light
is
actual
uv
light
the
near
mean
that
it
is
close
to
the
visibl
spectrum
ie
of
rel
long
wavelength
not
that
it
is
nearli
uv
im
sure
you
can
figur
out
now
just
what
far
uv
is
regular
incandensc
flashlight
bulb
emit
tini
amount
of
uv
in
the
near
end
of
the
spectrum
such
that
a
filter
can
be
use
to
remov
the
visibl
light
and
thu
creat
a
weak
uv
sourc
stronger
sourc
are
go
to
requir
ga
probabl
mercuri
vapor
discharg
tube
such
a
fluoresc
tube
with
uv
phosphor
be
care
though
strong
uv
sourc
can
caus
physiolog
damag
especi
to
the
eye
the
shorter
wavelength
are
the
most
danger
it
wouldnt
project
a
beam
like
a
flashlight
but
replac
the
tube
in
a
portabl
fluoresc
lantern
with
uv
tube
would
be
a
rel
cheap
way
to
creat
a
portabl
sourc
it
would
be
bright
enough
to
be
use
but
not
danger
so
ed
hall
