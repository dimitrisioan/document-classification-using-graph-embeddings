wonder
if
it
possibl
to
use
radio
wave
to
measur
the
distanc
between
a
transmitt
and
receiv
seem
to
me
that
you
should
be
abl
to
measur
the
signal
strength
and
determin
distanc
thi
would
be
for
short
distanc
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuraci
of
inch
or
so
thi
would
be
suscept
to
fade
multipath
etc
we
use
to
use
a
system
at
the
shop
made
by
telluromet
in
south
africa
it
use
a
ghz
signal
between
unit
across
the
distanc
to
be
measur
the

wa
just
the
carrier
the
real
signal
were
sever
switch
one
around
mhz
or
so
whose
rel
phase
at
the
receiv
would
read
out
the
digit
of
the
distanc
down
to
cm
if
need
the
unit
came
with
psychromet
sp
to
measur
the
rel

and
instruct
for
