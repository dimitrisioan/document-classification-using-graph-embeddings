point
an

at

cabl
wow
what
a
concept
doe
anybodi
want
to
specul
on
how
thi
nonconnect
would
fit
into
the
theft
of
cabl
servic
law
it
seem
to
me
that
unless
thi
case
is
specif
written
into
the
legisl
that
the
cabl
compani
would
not
have
a
leg
to
stand
upon
in
court
well
the
catv
compani
in
the
u
is
account
to
the
fcc
for
how
much
transmiss
their
cabl
make
in
fact
ive
heard
first
hand
about
how
the
catv
compani
ask
to
inspect
the
wire
in
a
homebusi
to
find
the
sourc
of
rf
leak
ive
heard
mani
of
their
van
have
rf
detector
and
they
keep
one
eye
on
them
a
they
drive
down
the
street
if
the
cabl
is
leaki
enough
to
have
usabl
signal
i
would
guess
that
theyr
probabl
in
violat
of
fcc
transmiss
law
in
england
they
do
did
requir
permit
to
oper
a
tv
supposedli
the
tv
polic
drove
around
with
rf
detector
look
for
the
if
or
whatev
produc
by
a
receiv
that
wasnt
regist
im
guess
the
purpos
wa
just
someth
els
they
could
get
away
with
tax
i
dont
know
if
the
tv
polic
werear
just
urban
legend
or
an
actual
the
tv
polic
are
still
with
u
im
afraid
a
pound
fine
go
out
to
the
unlicens
