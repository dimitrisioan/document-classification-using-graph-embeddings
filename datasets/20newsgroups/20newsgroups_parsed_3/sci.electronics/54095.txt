odd
valu
of
resistor
are
often
requir
ie
someth
like
a
k
ohm
resistorit
seem
best
to
choos
common
capacitor
valu
and
cope
with
the
strang
resist
then
demand
is
there
a
pd
program
out
there
that
will
work
out
how
best
to
make
up
such
a
resist
given
fix
resistor
of
the
standard
valu
per
decad
etc
it
is
a
common
enough
problem
yet
i
cant

a

that
tell

give

start
with

when
tri
to
choos
a
resistor
with
a

you
need

or
to

devic
it
cant
be
made
from
ad
resitor
of

in

sinc
the

devic
will
have
the
