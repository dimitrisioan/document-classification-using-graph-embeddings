for
some
time
ive
been
think
about
the
possibl
of
start
a
group
where
scientif
articl
can
be
publish
or
perhap
just
summari
possibl
advantag
would
be
free
distribut
fast
accept
onlin
discus
between
author
and
reader
thi
would
be
possibl
with
one
group
with
a
moder
for
publish
the
articl
and
one
perhap
without
for
discus
i
think
it
a
great
but
idealist
idea
a
reseach
will
first
of
all
tri
to
publish
a
worthi
paper
in
a
credibl
profession
magazin
and
not
in
a
commun
like
usenet
which
is
infam
for
lot
not
all
of
junk
inform
the
paper
that
will
be
publish
here
will
in
gener
be
of
low
qualiti
also
it
is
improb
that
ani
credit
will
be
given
to
a
research
who
publish
here
and
sadli
that
is
nowaday
a
main
reason
for
publish
usenet
is
great
for
inform
discus
and
free
exchang
of
idea
keep
it
like
that
a
new
specialist
group
is
just
not
worth
it
