re
adcom
cheap
product
i
want
to
upgrad
my
system
and
wa
think
of
buy
adcom
seper
i
have
heard
from
alot
of
peopl
though
that
adcom
sound
great
but
that
the
compon
are
made
cheapli
and
therefor
wont
last
veri
long
the
time
estim
ive
heard
are
like
onli
or
year
is
thi
true
i
own
the
adcom
w
power
amp
a
far
a
im
concern
there
no
amp
which
can
touch
it
at
the
price
rang
the
build
qualiti
is
veri
impress
and
is
far
superior
to
other
amp
in
the
price
rang
the
whole
amplifi
is
extrem
solid
with
massiv
heat
sink
and
veri
solid
case
if
you
open
the
amp
up
there
are
onli
veri
good
qualiti
compon
in
and
the
amp
seem
to
be
design
extrem
well
perfect
symmetri
for
both
channel
and
two
transform
one
for
each
channel
the
bind
post
on
the
back
of
the
amplifi
are
virtual
the
same
a
those
on
the
class
model
ie
veri
good
i
wa
also
sceptic
about
the
amp
be
built
in
the
fareast
or
whereev
but
if
you
look
in
the
amp
and
see
what
compon
they
use
and
how
it
wa
design
you
can
easili
see
whi
the
amplifi
sound
so
brilliant
i
can
not
see
whi
peopl
say
the
amplifi
wont
last
not
with
those
qualiti
compon
insid
sure
the
amp
run
veri
fairli
hot
but
that
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incred
good
my
last
point
i
recent
audit
the
adcom
preamp
someth
like
the
or
someth
it
wa
two
year
old
and
it
still
sound
like
new
if
you
build
an
amplifi
decent
like
the
adcom
they
will
sound
brilliant
and
last
a
long
time
period
just
my
thought
but
then
i
do
own
one
of
adcom
amp
alan
webber
the
path
you
tread
is
narrow
and
the
drop
is
sheer
and
veri
high
the
raven
all
are
watch
from
a
vantag
point
near
by
apprehens
creep
like
a
chootrain
up
your
spine
will
the
tightrop
reach
the
end
will
the
final
couplet
rhyme
