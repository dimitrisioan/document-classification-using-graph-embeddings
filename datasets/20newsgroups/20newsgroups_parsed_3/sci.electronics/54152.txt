subject
re
laser
v
bubblejet
here
is
a
differ
viewpoint
fyi
the
actual
horizont
dot
placement
resout
of
an
hp
deskjet
is
th
inch
the
electron
and
dynam
of
the
ink
cartridg
howev
limit
you
to
gener
dot
at
per
inch
on
almost
ani
paper
the
ink
wick
more
than
th
inch
anyway
the
method
of
deposit
and
fuse
toner
of
a
laster
printer
result
in
much
le
spread
than
ink
drop
technolog
in
practic
there
is
littl
differ
in
qualiti
but
more
care
is
need
with
inkjet
becaus
smudg
etc
can
happen
it
doesnt
take
much
investig
to
see
that
the
mechan
and
electron
complement
of
a
laser
printer
is
more
complex
than
inexpens
ink
jet
printer
recal
also
that
laser
printer
offer
a
much
higher
throughput
ppm
for
a
laser
versu
about
ppm
for
an
ink
jet
printer
a
cheap
laser
printer
doe
not
manag
that
sort
of
throughput
and
on
top
of
that
how
long
doe
the
first
sheet
take
to
print
inkjet
are
faster
than
you
say
and
in
both
case
the
comput
often
ha
troubl
keep
up
with
the
printer
i
have
a
and
a
lot
of
driver
can
not
keep
up
with
the
printer
a
sage
said
to
me
do
you
want
one
copi
or
lot
of
copi
one
inkjet
someth
el
to
think
about
is
the
cost
of
consum
over
the
life
of
the
printer
a
page
yield
toner
cartridg
is
about
u
at
discount
while
hp
high
capac
page
yield
cartridg
are
about
u
at
discount
it
could
be
that
over
the
life
cycl
of
the
printer
that
consum
for
laser
printer
are
le
than
ink
jet
printer
it
is
get
progress
closer
between
the
two
technolog
laser
printer
are
usual
desing
for
higher
duti
cycl
in
page
per
month
and
longer
product
replac
cycl
paper
cost
is
the
same
and
both
can
use
refil
long
term
the
laserprint
will
need
some
expens
replac
part
consum
and
on
top
of
that
are
the
amortis
cost
which
favour
the
lowest
purchas
cost
printer
hp
inkjet
understand
pcl
so
in
mani
case
a
laserjet
driver
will
work
if
the
softwar
packag
ha
no
inkjet
driver
there
is
one
wild
differ
between
the
two
printer
a
laserprint
is
a
page
printer
whilst
an
inkjet
is
a
line
printer
thi
mean
that
a
laserprint
can
rotat
graphic
imag
whilst
an
inkjet
can
not
few
driver
actual
use
thi
facil
there
is
also
the
matter
of
download
font
and
so
on
tc
email
or
