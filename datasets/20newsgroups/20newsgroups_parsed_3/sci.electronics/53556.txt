uninterrupt
power
suppli
in
articl
chri
best
write
im
no
expert
at
upss
but
you
said
someth
that
made
it
sound
like
you
didnt
realiz
someth
on
a
typic
up
well
on
our
anyway
there
is
no
switchov
from
ac
to
dc
all
the
protect
equip
is
alway
run
from
the
batteri
via
an
invert
with
the
usual
condit
of
also
have
them
on
charg
if
the
power
fail
big
deal
the
comput
never
see
it
until
the
batteri
start
to
droop
but
there
someth
like
carsiz
batteri
in
that
cabinet
so
it
take
a
while
if
you
were
gon
na
run
the
gut
on
straight
dc
instead
of
an
invert
whi
not
do
it
all
the
time
then
there
be
no
switchov
to
screw
thing
up
and
no
have
to
sen
the
failur
fast
just
keep
the
dc
on
charg
when
the
power
is
on
and
itll
be
there
in
zero
time
when
you
need
it
actual
it
a
bit
more
complic
than
thati
sound
to
me
your
up
take
in
ac
rectifi
it
to
dc
to
charg
the
batteri
and
then
take
the
batteri
dc
and
chop
it
to
ac
again
feed
your
equip
thi
approach
is
the
easiest
and
cleanest
way
to
switchov
from
the
main
to
batteri
onc
your
power
kick
out
sinc
a
you
mention
noth
will
know
about
what
happen
down
the
line
anoth
way
to
do
the
up
scheme
is
to
use
the
main
until
you
lose
power
and
then
kick
in
the
batteri
backup
with
it
invert
to
replac
the
lost
power
the
problem
here
is
the
switchov
time
and
youv
got
to
resync
the
ac
in
no
time
flat
unfortun
most
everyth
is
built
around
the
assumpt
that
ac
is
avail
so
the
up
guy
have
to
provid
and
ac
output
to
be
usableya
sorta
have
to
make
it
work
with
what
there
alreadi
similar
stori
with
our
telephon
system
it
wa
first
invent
back
in
the
s
were
still
use
the
same
damn
system
medium
a
they
did
back
then
if
i
have
a
phone
from
back
then
i
can
assur
you
itll
work
on
today
phone
system
it
cost
too
much
to
overhaul
everyon
to
a
new
system
so
they
make
it
work
with
what
is
out
there
