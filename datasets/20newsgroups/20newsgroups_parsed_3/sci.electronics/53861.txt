suppos
we
have
a
boolean
function
which
is
a
minim
sumofproduct
deriv
from
a
kmap
or
someth
like
thi
fabcd
bcd
acd
abc
abc
the
book
on
logic
design
i
have
consult
all
seem
to
impli
that
thi
is
where
the
analysi
end
but
by
factor
out
the
a
term
in
the
function
we
can
get
fewer
gate
fabcd
bcd
acd

bc
which
yield
gate
ye
but
the
minim
of
gate
is
import
in
part
becaus
of
time
consider
a
ttl
gate
ha
the
basic
structur
of
andorinvert
and
an
invers
of
a
sum
of
a
product
is
just
exactli
one
gate
delay
the
reason
to
find
a
minim
sum
of
product
is
that
thi
match
a
hardwar
optim
a
positiveor
gate
such
a
the
gate
solut
us
ha
two
gate
delay
and
there
anoth
gate
delay
in
the
second
term
so
that
the
second
solut
while
simpler
in
logic
symbol
can
be
expect
to
be
someth
le
than
optim
in
the
real
world
ecl
is
similar
to
ttl
in
that
it
can
support
an
orand
gate
with
the
minimum
delay
unlik
ttl
you
get
both
true
and
invers
output
for
free
when
use
ecl

andorinvert
gate
with
your

intern
connect
between
the
variou
section
and
perhap
some
latch
so
a
minimum
sum
of
product
also
is
a
way
to
shoehorn
a
logic
design
into
a
few
pal
it
not
compar
easi
to
design
with
a
minim
of
logic
gate
but
some
softwar
packag
claim
to
allow
you
to
do
so
and
will
take
just
about
ani
mess
of

a
a

and

a
