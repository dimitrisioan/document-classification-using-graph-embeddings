realli
dont
know
where
to
post
thi
question
so
i
figur
that
thi
board
would
be
most
appropri
i
wa
wonder
about
those
massiv
concret
cylind
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
site
they
look
like
cylind
that
have
been
pinch
in
the
middl
doe
anybodi
know
what
the
actual
purpos
of
those
thing
are
i
hear
that
theyr
call
cool
tower
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
except
for
their
size
the
cool
tower
on
nuclear
power
plant
are
vertual
ident
in
construct
and
oper
to
cool
tower
design
and
built
in
the
s
a
hundr
year
ago
for
coal
fire
power
plant
use
for
light
and
earli
electr
railway
basicli
the
cylindr
tower
support
a
rapid
air
draft
when
it
air
is
heat
by
hot
water
andor
steam
circul
thru
a
network
of
pipe
that
fill
about
the
lower
of
the
tower
to
assist
cool
and
the
draft
water
mister
are
ad
that
spray
cold
water
over
the
hot
pipe
the
cold
water
evapor
remov
the
heat
faster
than
just
air
flow
from
the
draft
would
and
the
result
water
vapor
is
rapidli
carri
away
by
the

thi

the
cloud
frequent

rise
out
of
these

that
slight
pinch
mayb
of
the
way
up
the
tower
is
there
becaus
it
produc
a
veri
signific
increas
in
the
strength
and
rate
of
the
air
draft
produc
compar
to
a
straight
cylind
shape
the
tower
are
use
to
recondens
the
steam
in
the
seal
steam
system
of
the
power
plant
so
that
it
can
be
recircul
back
to
the
boiler
and
use
again
the

the
temperatur
differ

the

use
in
the
power
plant
the
more
effeci
they
are
and
by
recondens
the
steam
in
the
cool
tower
befor
send
it
back
to
the
boiler
you
maintain
