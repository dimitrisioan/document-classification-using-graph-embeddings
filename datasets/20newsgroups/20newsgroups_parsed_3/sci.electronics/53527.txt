im
want
to
build
a
simpl
up
for
my
pc
sustain
the
comput
long
enough
to
complet
the
current
task
and
save
to
minut
should
be
enough
i
think
though
i
dont
realli
need
to
keep
the
monitor
activ
i
can
tri
to
rememb
what
to
do
so
mayb
i
can
avoid
a
dcac
invert
and
just
use
a
batteri
to
directli
suppli
the
motherboard
and
peripher
now
there
a
good
idea
all
you
need
is
amp
dc
for
a
few
minut
and
a
good
wetwar
memori
wa
i
use
wp
or
autocad
or
i
thought
of
the
same
idea
myself
a
few
day
ago
ive
got
a
fairli
new
car
batteri
that
i
take
along
in
my
x
when
i
go
camp
and
it
sit
around
useless
when
im
home
i
wish
i
could
get
a
batteryless
up
to
use
it
with
or
use
it
with
a
heavi
duti
volt
regul
to
suppli
the
pc
but
i
guess
youd
need
v
and
v
and
too
more
batteri
an
altern
would
be
to
leav
a
amp
batteri
charger
hook
up
to
the
batteri
and
run
a
vdc
to
vac
convert
run
all
the
time
and
when
the
power
go
out
voila
the
vac
convert
keep
on
run
off
the
batteri
and
then
i
could
take
the
vac
convert
and
my
comput
on
the
camp
trip
