im
consid
switch
to
geico
insur
but
have
heard
that
they
do
not
assign
a
specif
agent
for
each
polici
or
claim
i
wa
worri
that
thi
might
be
a
real
pain
when
you
make
a
claim
i
have
also
heard
that
they
tri
to
get
rid
of
you
if
you
have
an
accid
ive
read
in
thi
group
that
geico
ha
fund
the
purchas
of
radar
gun
by
polic
dept
im
not
sure
where
geico
ha
purchas
radar
gun
in
sever
state
i
know
they
have
done
it
here
in
ct
i
have
also
heard
horror
stori
about
peopl
that
have
been
insur
by
geico
for
year
and
then
had
accid
and
were
immedi
drop
and
onc
youv
been
drop
by
ani
insruanc
compani
you
becom
labl
a
high
risk
and
end
up
fork
out
or
time
what
you
should
be
for
insur
thi
must
vari
from
state
to
state
becaus
our
old
compani
kemper
want
to
drop
me
keep
my
wife
or
trippl
our
premium
becaus
i
had
ticket
onli
point
for
mph
over
speed
limit
well
i
call
geico
and
they
insur
both
my
wife
and
i
for
le
then
we
were
previous
pay
kemper
gener
i
hate
the
whole
insur
game
i
realiz
that
it
is
necessari
but
the
way
that
a
person
can
get
dick
around
doesnt
make
ani
sen
one
good
thing
about
geico
is
that
everyth
can
be
handl
over
the
phone
my
suggest
stay
where
you
are
or
shop
around
but
stay
away
from
geico
jeff
larri
oo
v

forev
the
fact
that
i
need
to
explain
it
to
you
indic
that
you
probabl
wouldnt
understand
anyway
