so
mani
newsgroup
so
littl
time
i
bought
a
brand
new
chevrolet
k
hd
x
extend

last
may
it
ha
had
mani
mani
problem
see
my
earler
post
that
describ
the
situat
i
went
to
bbb
arbitr
and
they
rule
that
chevrolet
must
buy
it
back
from
me
if
you
do
get
one
stay
away
from
the
speed
manual
with
the
deep
low
first
gear
they
have
put
three
of
them
in
my
truck
so
far
after
about
mile
overdr
either
start
rattl
or
hiss
loudli
there
is
no
way
to
fix
them
chevrolet
say
that
the
nois
is
a
characterist
of
the
transmiss
also
if
you
are
plan
to
use
your
truck
to
tow
the
gear
ratio
in
that
tranni
suck
on
a
steep
hill
you
get
up
to
about
mph
in
second
gear
at
rpm
yellow
line
if
you
shift
to
third
the
rpm
drop
to
onli
and
you
begin
to
loo
speed
i
should
point
out
that
the
v
they
put
in
the
hd
gvw
truck
is
a
detun
motor
compar
to
the
one
they
put
in
the
light
duti
one
they
drop
the
compress
ratio
supposedli
for
engin
longev
reason
so
the
light
duti
may
pull
better
than
my
truck
doe
other
thing
that
have
gone
wrong
includ
the
ventil
fan
time
so
far
paint
had
spec
of
rust
embed
in
the
paint
from
be
ship
by
rail
with
no
cover
and
suspens
part
link
between
stabil
and
control
arm
fell
off
ani
compani
can
make
a
bad
individu
car
chevrolet
includ
what
realli
bother
me
wa
the
way
they
react
they
made
no
attempt
to
deal
with
me
except
to
tell
me
to
take
it
back
to
the
dealer
for
them
to
attempt
to
fix
it
one
more
time
so
i
bought
a

with
a
and
an
automat
i
will
never
buy
anoth
chevrolet
