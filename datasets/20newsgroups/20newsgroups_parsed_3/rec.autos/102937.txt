also
someon
said
that
ford
ha
issu
a

bulletin
to
inform

plea
to

sound
i
drive
it
to
and
from
work
each
day
on
rel
smooth
road
and
most
notic
thing
is
that
the
probe
suspens
doesnt
like
pothol
when
you
test
drive
one
find
a
pothol
road
somewher
around

and
see
if
the

you
get
is

ye
thi

stiff
suspens
isnt
for
everyon
i
person
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
littl
harsh
but
otherwis
like
the
car
id
strongli
suggest
look
into
the
mx
if
you
have
passeng
by
all
mean
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
ride
differ
if
that
better
is
up
to
you
the
problem
with
the
back
seat
is
that
there
no
leg
room
plenti
of
head
room
though
shorter
peopl
fit
back
there
without
ani
complaint
so
long
a
the
seat
they
are
sit
behind
is
pull
forward
a
bit
to
give
them
a
place
to
put
their
foot
also
there
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expect
the
temperatur
insid
the
car
get
pretti
hot
in
the
summer
my
back
seat
passeng
now
veri
few
complain
about
the
lack
of
ventil
you
may
want
to
consid
that
when
combin
with
the
heat
the
power
moonroof
can
greatli
improv
the
ventil
throughout
the
car
i
realli
enjoy
the
moonroof
by
the
way
but
then
ive
alway
been
a
sucker
for
open
air
drive
no
leakag
problem
or
anyth
like
thatyet
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
ha
troubl
but
mine
work
fine
i
havent
heard
about
thi
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
veri
earli
probe
and
mayb
had
problem
with
prematur
rust
muffler
which
ford
will
replac
at
no
charg
but
i
havent
heard
about
anyth
like
thi
concern
the
probe
i
havent
had
ani
real
troubl
with
thi
car
outsid
of
a
cv
joint
boot
that
wa
leak
but
the
dealer
took
care
of
that
promptli
and
even
gave
me
a
free
rental
car
for
the
day
and
a
half
that
i
wa
without
my
car
i
wa
quit
happi
with
the
way
they
handledespeci
consid
that
i
wa
expect
the
worst
from
them
from
what
ive
heard
it
sound
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problem
with
the
probe
and
probabl
mx
when
they
first
went
into
product
but
i
think
these
problem
have
mostli
been
correct
at
thi
point
that
almost
alway
to
be
expect
with
a
complet
new
car
like
thi
