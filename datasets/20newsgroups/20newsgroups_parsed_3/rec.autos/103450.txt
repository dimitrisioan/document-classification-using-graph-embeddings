subject
review
audi
s
quattro
it
been
a
while
sinc
ive
review
a
car
but
today
i
paid
a
visit
to
an
old
friend
whose
love
for
audi
ha
been
so
overwhelm
that
he
make
a
not
too
sucess
live
sell
them
without
further
delay
i
will
get
to
the
audi
s
servotron
steer
for
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
what
servotron
is
it
is
the
name
for
the
speed
variabl
power
steer
manufactur
by
zf
and
use
in
audi
and
bmw
i
have
been
outspoken
in
my
dam
of
servotron
over
the
past
coupl
of
month
and
thi
wa
base
on
magazin
review
and
drive
of
the
audi
c
quattro
and
the
audi
c
fwd
i
am
quit
happi
to
report
now
that
on
the
s
the
servotron
is
inoffens
i
suppos
that
due
to
the
fat
gumbal
tire
the
servotron
ha
been
load
up
more
and
thi
so
far
ha
been
the
best
implement
that
i
have
tri
it
is
far
from
perfect
mind
you
and
id
be
much
happier
if
it
wa
an
option
that
i
could
refus
but
on
the
s
i
no
longer
consid
thi
to
be
bad
enough
where
i
feel
the
entir
car
is
ruin
the
steer
is
still
a
tad
too
light
but
it
is
accur
and
i
suppos
the
stiffli
sprung
chassi
send
back
so
much
inform
that
some
make
it
through
to
the
driver
hand
so
there
is
feel
and
there
is
accuraci
in
the
s
steer
but
there
is
also
room
for
improv
i
consid
the
s
steer
to
be
better
than
the
japanes
competit
primarili
becaus
the
japanes
do
not
believ
in
feel
and
engin
it
out
complet
engin
wheee
what
a
pressur
cooker
with
just
mile
on
the
clock
i
did
not
expect
the
s
to
be
produc
anywher
close
to
what
it
will
be
put
out
mile
later
but
still
the
car
pack
a
terrif
punch
for
a
turbocharg
machin
it
is
veri
unusu
in
that
it
encourag
lazi
drive
ie
low
rev
high
gear
it
is
so
suprem
flexibl
that
one
could
hardli
believ
that
there
onli
liter
of
displac
to
move
thi
pound
car
around
in
such
a
fashion
with
maximum
torqu
avail
at
rpm
and
a
rpm
redlin
the
car
can
pretti
much
be
left
in
third
all
day
which
translat
to
a
speed
rang
of
someth
like
mph
a
chracterist
that
one
normal
associ
with
larg
capac
v
the
technic
achiev
is
breadthtak
throttl
respons
is
right
up
there
with
a
good
atmospher
engin
in
fact
it
would
even
put
peaki
multivalv
engin
to
shame
downshift
are
almost
unnecessari
it
is
more
fun
to
use
the
overboost
featur
than
to
rev
the
engin
for
those
not
familiar
the
s
engin
featur
up
to
second
of
addit
turbo
boost
for
pas
sort
of
like
light
up
the
after
burner
in
a
jet
fighter
one
could
with
the
right
foot
onli
in
third
gear
blast
the
car
from
to
in
just
a
few
moment
simpli
by
floor
the
ga
a
far
a
the
number
go
maximum
torqu
avail
in
overboost
mode
shoot
up
to
about
lb
ft
incred
for
a
liter
it
take
a
few
moment
for
it
to
develop
overboost
but
it
is
well
worth
wait
for
sinc
thi
is
quit
a
heavi
car
one
bodi
part
are
not
flung
around
like
say
the
corrado
vr
the
acceler
is
smooth
and
strong
somewhat
similar
to
ride
in
a
jetlin
a
it
acceler
down
the
runway
on
takeoff
also
one
is
treat
to
a
veri
distinct
and
entertain
whistl
from
the
turbo
the
onli
entertain
sound
to
come
out
of
a
veri
refin
but
bland
sound
banger
ye
audi
ha
refin
the
to
the
point
where
at
rpm
it
sound
a
seren
a
it
doe
at
the
smooth
is
outstand
but
not
quit
up
to
the
standard
of
a
veri
good
eg
a
valv
bmw
id
say
that
in
term
of
refin
ie
willing
to
rev
smooth
lack
of
harsh
under
full
acceler
it
is
better
than
mani
v
howev
lost
in
the
refin
process
is
the
characterist
cylind
bark
that
made
the
older
engin
so
charact
if
not
terribl
refin
the
valv
turbo
sound
pretti
bland
except
for
the
whistl
under
full
boost
subject
id
rate
the
vw
vr
engin
a
be
far
more
music
than
the
turbo
also
audi
own
v
is
also
far
more
music
with
a
rorti
race
car
growl
when
press
though
none
of
these
can
match
it
grunt
the
onli
hint
of
the
engin
true
capac
occur
when
one
is
take
off
from
rest
after
the
turbo
ha
come
to
a
near
stop
with
the
extra
inertia
from
the
perman
engag
wd
system
one
ha
to
be
somewhat
delic
in
feed
in
the
clutch
to
prevent
an
embarass
stall
altern
one
could
use
more
rev
in
both
case
a
veri
small
price
to
pay
for
such
a
fantast
engin
i
think
that
audi
of
america
should
offer
an
automat
option
for
thi
car
just
a
they
offer
though
in
extrem
small
number
a
speed
for
the
much
peakier
v
the
characterist
of
the
engin
are
perfect
for
an
automat
iron
in
europ
a
slush
is
avail
but
none
is
offer
for
the
land
of
the
slush
market
twit
rear
their
ugli
head
again
chassi
ive
notic
that
audi
tend
to
have
veri
wide
wheel
and
rel
modest
tire
width
the
car
come
with
fireston
of
size
zr
which
is
not
uncommon
at
all
howev
the
veri
attract
spoke
wheel
are
no
le
than
inch
wide
so
there
is
no
sidewal
bulg
whatsoev
combin
with
the
flare
wheel
arch
the
s
ha
a
mouth
water
macho
yet
subdu
look
on
rough
concret
it
becom
immedi
clear
that
the
new
bodi
style
ha
made
signific
advanc
in
structur
rigid
a
well
a
road
nois
suppress
i
suppos
the
two
are
interrel
but
i
digress
to
use
a
clich
the
s
bodi
feel
like
it
ha
been
carv
out
of
stone
flex
is
total
undetect
even
when
go
over
rough
road
with
a
super
rigid
bodi
like
thi
stiff
spring
and
stiff
damper
do
not
caus
excess
harsh
and
while
the
s
ride
qualiti
will
never
worri
a
lexu
it
will
also
not
draw
comparison
to
truck
or
poni
car
the
servotron
steer
ha
alreadi
been
mention
i
consid
it
to
be
inoffens
becaus
it
did
not
inhibit
spirit
corner
i
wa
abl
to
test
the
car
corner
power
without
too
much
trepid
i
think
a
new
concept
is
at
work
in
thi
car
with
it
fat
gumbal
tire
talk
about
underst
or
overst
is
practic
meaningless
on
a
bank
highway
on
ramp
i
went
in
slow
and
start
appli
power
a
i
went
around
i
could
feel
the
g
forc
build
to
the
point
where
the
skin
on
my
face
wa
be
tug
sideway
yet
the
car
wa
total
and
complet
obedi
to
throttl
and
steer
input
it
felt
that
the
limit
were
not
even
close
to
be
approach
the
g
forc
were
thrill
but
the
entir
affair
of
go
around
a
curv
is
strang
uninvolv
you
tell
the
car
what
you
want
and
it
doe
it
end
of
stori
i
think
that
i
am
start
to
relat
more
and
more
to
those
review
who
were
highli
impress
by
the
honda
nsx
clinic
effici
but
were
unabl
to
fall
in
love
with
the
car
the
brake
have
a
veri
good
firm
to
them
and
stop
the
car
pretti
well
too
though
ive
read
that
they
are
prone
to
fade
i
am
not
too
surpris
sinc
the
s
doe
not
have
uprat
brake
over
the
base
audi
fwd
harder
pad
would
help
but
that
in
turn
would
lead
to
a
more
wooden
respons
when
cold
i
am
start
to
see
a
trend
among
the
luxurysport
sedan
maker
where
extra
weight
is
not
be
offset
by
addit
brake
capac
the
l
fade
perform
is
noth
to
brag
about
neither
is
the
q
or
the
legend
brake

these
day
seem
to
be

that

that

if
