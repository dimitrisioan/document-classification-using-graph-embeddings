comment
a
good
perform
and
mid
and
high
speed
can
be
obtain
by
adjust
the
top
gear
and
final
drive
ratio
contrari
to
popular
mispercept
a
number
of
japanes
car
have
quit
good
perform
from
in
top
gear
no
problem
with
that
the
question
is
do
they
perform
consist
in
all
condit
road
wind
and
curv
at
that
speed
and
do
so
for
hour
on
end
year
after
year
without
give
the
driver
white
knuckl
from
my
experi
on
the
autobahnsautostrad
a
good
tour
car
can
be
easili
distinguish
by
it
poi
at
mph
the
best
stay
on
cruis
control
at
for
hour
ive
seen
the
typic
boy
racer
in
a
fiat
tri
to
keep
up
sure
they
hit
the
centuri
mark
but
if
the
wind
blow
the
wrong
way
they
chang
lane
and
if
on
an
overpass
they
may
fli
right
into
a
guardrail
the
buffet
at
can
be
sever
enough
to
make
the
hood
bend
tire
at
can
melt
and
a
pothol
can
kill
mani
german
car
are
design
for
thi
environ
even
if
they
cant
seem
to
get
out
of
their
own
way
from
a
stop
light
merced
come
to
mind
in
particular
and
anoth
design
point
is
fuel
economi
at
those
speed
the
german
gear
the
car
for
veri
good
high
speed
effici
a
typic
mb
e
turn
at
almost
a
stall
good
point
i
have
no
idea
how
either
of
my
honda
will
handl
at
mph
nor
do
they
reach
howev
use
high
to
be
mph
a
they
are
quit
amen
to
long
high
speed
drive
ive
done
sever
k
mile
trip
in
my
civic
with
no
problem
whatsoev
the
last
big
trip
i
made
wa
drive
from
new
york
to
texa
i
rememb
drive
mile
a
day
at
typic
mph
without
ani
problem
im
sure
i
would
have
been
more
comfort
drive
a
benz
but
no
white
knuckl
no
problem
with
wind
and
curv
then
there
wa
the
trip
back
from
new
orlean
after
mardi
gra
where
we
were
do
all
the
way
to
houston
no
problem
b
both
my
car
have
surpris
good
fuel
economi
at
high
speed
i
see
no
differ
between
sustain
mph
and
sustain
mph
on
the
trip
back
from
new
orlean
we
got
about
mpg
in
my
integra
quit
ok
mind
you
the
engin
rev
to
almost
k
at
the
civic
is
markedli
better
than
the
integra
in
fuel
economi
k
mile
down
the
road
i
still
get
mpg
at
mph
drive
b
i
cant
understand
whi
these
highscal
european
marque
are
afraid
to
design
engin
that
can
be
repeatedli
rev
to
near
redlin
in
the
low
gear
i
have
been
do
that
for
that
last
k
mile
with
my
lowli
civic
with
no
detriment
to
either
the
engin
or
the
clutch
and
get
excel
mpg
to
boot
id
call
thi
an
engin
hack
to
cover
up
design
defici
at
k
mile
youd
still
be
breakingin
a
highscal
european
marque
they
typic
are
design
to
last
mile
per
engin
mi
per
chassi
the
record
is
now
over
mile
on
a
benz
diesel
and
ive
read
about
transmiss
last
mile
speak
of
now
now
you
cant
compar
a
diesel
with
a
gasolin
engin
i
see
enough
bmw
and
gasolin
merc
for
sale
that
have
k
mile
on
them
and
advertis
rebuilt
engin
if
honda
wa
to
build
an
accord
for
k
id
darn
well
expect
the
sucker
to
last
k
mile
diesel
they
have
veri
good
effici
at
the
cost
of
acceler
and
are
veri
popular
in
all
european
car
diesel
is
consid
the
green
fuel
from
the
smallest
econobox
to
the
luxobarg
again
we
see
a
differ
in
mental
diesel
in
the
u
are
consid
slightli
wors
than
useless
and
extrem
dirti
to
boot
so
you
cant
give
them
away
ever
got
caught
behind
a
earli
s
sdl
at
a
stop
light
it
not
pleasant
the
newer
mb
are
a
lot
better
though
the
diesel
volvo
and
vw
are
probabl
the
smelliest
offend
a
for
economi
whi
should
we
care
ga
is
cheap
i
person
wouldnt
