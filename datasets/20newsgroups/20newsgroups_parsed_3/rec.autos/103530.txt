in

previou
articl
gari
w
mahan
say
could
someon
explain
how
to
make
sens
of
drag
coeffici
ie
cd
mention
in
magazin
i
understand
that
lower
number
signifi
better
aerodynam
but
what
doe
thi
mean
in
the
real
world
is
there
a
way
to
calcul
new
top
speedsassum
the
car
is
not
rev
limit
at
top
speed
or
mileag
benefit
if
a
ident
car
had
the
cd
reduc
from
to
it
pretti
complex
and
cd
isnt
the
whole
stori
either
cd
for
car
is
usual
calcul
base
on
the
frontal
area
of
the
car
so
a
larg
car
with
a
good
cd
could
get
the
same
drag
forc
a
a
smaller
car
with
a
poorer
cd
to
calcul
drag
use
thi
formula
d
rho
v
cd
s
where
d
is
the
drag
forc
lb
rho
is
the
local
air
densiti
slugsft
v
is
the
veloc
ft
and
s
is
the
frontal
area
ft
note
that
the
piec
call
rho
v
are
sometim
call
qbar
or
dynam
pressur
a
fanci
aero
term
for
air
pressur
or
forc
note
that
power
is
p
f
v
where
p
is
power
lbfft
f
is
the
forc
drag
in
thi
case
lbf
and
v
is
veloc
ft
note
that
if
you
put
the
whole
equat
into
one
by
substitut
d
for
forc
you
get
a
veloc
cube
term
that
whi
huge
increas
in

result
in

increas
in

ditto
for
decreas

so
if
you
have
a
