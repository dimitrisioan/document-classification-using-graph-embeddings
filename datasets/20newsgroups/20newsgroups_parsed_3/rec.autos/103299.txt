mustang
it
suppos
to
be
streamlin
look
similar
to
the
mach
iii
concept
car
ford
came
out
with
around
januari
i
cant
wait
anyon
out
there
hear
anyth
about
it
recent
if
everyth
ive
read
is
correct
ford
is
do
noth
but
re
skin
the
exist
mustang
with
minor
suspens
modif
and
the
pictur
ive
seen
indic
they
didnt
do
a
veri
good
job
of
it
the
new
mustang
is
noth
but
a
recycl
of
a
year
old
car
gee
is
it
alreadi
ye
it
will
still
be
on
the
fox
program
chasi
anyth
that
will
be
differ
nt
on
the
new
car
a
far
a
mechan
is
unknown
the
suspens
will
most
like
be
chang
a
well
a
the
drive
drain
from
what
ha
been
print
on
it
there
is
no
clear
idea
of
what
will
be
done
a
some
say
it
will
have
the
modular
v
and
other
the
current
small
block
just
have
to
wait
and
see
also
is
far
a
style
goe
from
what
i
seen
is
good
a
return
to
tradit
c
scoop
on
the
side
and
roof
line
much
like
a
or
fastback
you
know
im
a
ford
fan
i
must
say
so
im
look
forward
to
the
next
mustang
i
have
faith
that
it
will
be
a
fine
product
more
desir
than
the
camaro
is
now
you
know
that
mho
the
differ
these
day
between
ford
and
gm
are
not
so
much
the
qualiti
just
the
philosophi
it
use
to
be
qualiti
and
philosophi
gm
is
bare
catch
up
but
they
have
more
room
for
improv
that
can
onli
be
made
up
in
time
stss
still
come
off
the
assembl
line
with
screw
up
paint
stripe
and
poor
trunkdoorhoodpanel
align
it
those
year
old
plant
and
the
latest
gm
product
still
come
with
the
standard
equip
rattledash
tm
but
like
i
said
theyr
get
better
and
make
the
move
in
the
right
direct
they
beat
ford
to
the
market
with
the
camarofirebird
but
realli
onli
in
word
product
of
these
vehicl
will
be
limit
until
the
end
of
the
year
keep
sell
price
abov
msrp
for
the
most
part
sinc
there
are
so
mani
twitch
camaro
fan
out
there
i
wouldnt
press
ford
to
hurri
the
mustang
sinc
the
final
wait
could
be
worth
it
besid
no
bowti
fanat
is
gon
na
buy
the
mustang
anyway
i
do
not
put
much
stock
in
the
mag
rag
insid
inform
or
even
ford
rep
quot
the
tauru
wa
pretti
much
a
surpris
when
it
wa
final
disclos
in
it
entireti
insid
inform
had
the
tauru
with
a
v
and
rearwheel
drive
at
one
point
i
wouldnt
look
for
a
simpl
repanel
mustang
folk
you
may
be
cheat
yourself
if
you
do
there
a
lot
of
potenti
ford
hasnt
releas
a
new
car
without
a
wheel
is
in
year
the
mustang
project
ha
been
brew
for
at
least
right
a
wheel
is
could
happen
those
modular
v
are
out
there
too
in
the
interest
of
cafe
and
competit
dont
rule
those
out
either
your
ignor
if
you
do
and
there
are
so
mani
spi
shot
and
artist
render
out
there
who
realli
know
what
itll
look
like
the
mach
iii
doubt
it
highli
the
next
mustang
will
be
ford
highest
profil
car
it
attract
way
more
attent
than
the
camarofirebird
becaus
it
heritag
is
more
embed
in
the
gener
public
dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believ
ford
will
forfeit
that
i
submit
that
the
mustang
will
be
a
success
enough
to
elicit
defens
remark
from
some
heavi
camaro
fan
here
you
know
intellig
critic
spew
like
the
mustang
bite
man
some
of
you
are
alreadi
begin
i
predict
that
the
mustang
and
camaro
will
be
compar
perform
a
usual
i
predict
that
the
differ
will
be
in
subject
area
like
look
and
feel
a
usual
the
camaro
is
still
a
huge
automobil
the
mustang
will
retain
it
cabrearward
style
and
short
ponycar
wheelbas
the
camaro
still
reach
out
to
the
fighter
pilot
while
the
mustang
will
appeal
to
the
driver
the
camaro
will
still
sell
to
the
muscl
car
set
while
the
mustang
will
continu
to
sell
to
the
collegedegre
muscl
car
set
both
will
be
more
refin
i
do
think
the
camaro
is
there
will
be
no
clear
winner
unless
the
ford
get
the
v
hp
romeo
you
dont
serious
believ
that
it
wa
design
for
the
mark
