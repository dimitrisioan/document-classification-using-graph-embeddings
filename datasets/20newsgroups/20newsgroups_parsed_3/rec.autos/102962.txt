with
ab
airbag
over

i
never

i
did
look
at

but
that

i
drive

from

each

and
most
notic
thing
is
that
the

pothol
when
you
test

one
find
a

theyll
find
that
they

youll
find
that

that
better
is

veri
few
complain
about
the

you
may
want
to
consid
that
when

werent
avail
when
i
got

so
i
cant
comment
on
them
i
got
the

befor
it
wa
offici
announc
i
prefer
cloth
to
leather
anyway
i
wouldnt
want
thi

the

is
too
rough
for

pothol
