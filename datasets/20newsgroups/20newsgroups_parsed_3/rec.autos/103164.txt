re
rfi
art
of
clutchless
shift
im
not
familiar
with
the
tranni
use
in
winston
cup
but
in
the
transam
car
ive
play
with
the
transmiss
were
the
race
varieti
with
dog
clutch
instead
of
sychro
in
a
transmiss
with
dog
clutch
the
gear
are
alway
engag
with
each
other
and
move
the
dog
clutch
engag
the
gear
to
the
shaft
motorcycl
transmiss
are
the
same
way
shift
without
the
clutch
on
a
transmiss
with
syncro
can
and
will
caus
transmiss
damag
the
onli
question
be
how
long
it
takesto
grenad
someth
for
the
tran
in
my
pulsar
se
it
wa
about
k
mile
but
it
had
a
weak
tranni
in
the
first
place
just
out
of
curios
how
is
thi
dog
clutch
ani
differ
from
a
synchro
transmiss
what
you
describ
sound
the
same
to
me
in
fact
what
littl
ive
studi
on
tranni
the
instructor
refer
to
the
synchro
a
dog
and
said
they
were
synonym
the
gear
are
alway
mesh
in
a
synchron
gearbox
and
you
slip
the
synchro
gear
back
and
forth
by
shift
or
at
least
that
is
what
i
wa
taught
explain
por
favour
motorcycl
transmiss
dont
have
synchro
the
engag
dog
are
veri
cors
and
sloppi
there
are
mayb
teeth
dog
on
the
side
of
the
gear
that
engag
the
next
gear
over
a
the
fork
slide
the
gear
back
and
forth
to
shift
start
to
appli
pressur
at
the
same
time
the
clutch
is
pull
the
clutch
is
a
hand
lever
and
shift
quickli
if
you
tri
a
slow
lazi
shift
it
will
grind
you
just
have
to
pop
it
into
the
next
gear
befor
it
ha
a
chanc
to
grind
there
isnt
a
neutral
between
gear
obvious
there
is
but
you
cant
select
it
with
the
shifter
so
doubl
clutch
is
not
a
possibl
speed
shift
which
is
what
i
have
alway
heard
clutchless
shift
call
work
pretti
well
for
upshift
with
some
practic
but
i
usual
use
the
clutchespeci
for
the
lower
gear
i
think
auto
a
in
automobil
tranni
are
similar
except
that
the
engag
dog
are
veri
fine
with
no
slop
and
the
addit
of
syncho
ring
the
gear
teeth
are
alway
engag
in
auto
transmiss
that
are
synchron
but
may
not
be
in
nonsynchro
gear
