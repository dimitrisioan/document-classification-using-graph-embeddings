i
have
an
experi
a
few
year
ago
that
might
be
interest
to
you
i
own
a
toyota
celica
gt
i
decid
to
buy
myself
a
gift
a
more
exot
car
front
runner
includ
the
toyota
supra
turbo
and
the
porsch
model
year
i
narrow
it
down
to
those
two
i
like
the
simplic
and
handl
and
snob
appeal
too
of
drive
a
porsch
the
supra
turbo
wa
le
money
and
had
more
featur
and
perform
almost
a
person
luxuri
car
it
had
better
acceler
and
a
higher
top
speed
than
the
i
wa
almost
readi
to
give
in
to
a
buy
impuls
for
the
but
i
decid
to
stop
by
my
insur
agent
offic
on
the
way
i
ask
about
what
would
happen
to
my
rate
with
either
car
if
you
buy
the
supra
your
rate
classif
will
be
the
same
a
the
celica
the
celica
wa
consid
a
subcompact
and
for
that
year
wa
rate
a
one
of
the
safest
car
with
a
slight
increas
becaus
the
car
will
be
year
newer
our
lowerrisk
divis
will
continu
to
handl
your
account
if
you
buy
the
porsch
well
have
to
chang
you
to
the
standard
higher
rate
compani
and
your
rate
will
doubl
and
if
you
go
with
a
it
anoth
stori
again
well
cover
the
rest
of
thi
year
but
cancel
you
after
that
but
the
supra
is
much
faster
than
the
and
the
is
actual
faster
than
the
standard
that
doenst
make
sens
that
what
the
book
say
we
dont
insur
corvett
either
for
some
reason
the
underwrit
consid
supra
and
their
driver
a
veri
tradit
and
conserv
i
eventu
went
with
the
supra
for
a
number
of
reason
the
porsch
dealer
had
a
nice
salesman
to
get
me
interest
but
a
tough
highpressur
guy
in
the
back
room
at
equal
monthli
payment
it
would
have
taken
a
year
longer
to
pay
for
the
porsch
plu
it
higher
insur
i
conclud
that
the
high
insur
wa
relat
to
probabl
of
auto
theft
everyon

to
my

imagin
is
