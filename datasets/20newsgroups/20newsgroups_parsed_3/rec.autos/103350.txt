i
notic
thi

think
the
water
is
come
up
through
some
rubber
stopper
hole
beneath
the
spare

problem
with

definit
not
com
up
from
the
rubber
stopper
hole
beneath
the
spare
i
have
to
remov
the
rubber
stopper
to
drain
the
water
seem
like
a
common
problem
with
probe
there
is
a
known
problem
with
the
seal
on
the
taillight
of
probe
complain
loudli
to
your
dealer
and
get
them
to
instal
new
seal
it
is
a
known
problem
present
on

all
pre
