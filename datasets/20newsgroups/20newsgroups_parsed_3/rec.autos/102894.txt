i
mention
thi
aloud
to

better
to

i
pick
up
the
phone
on
the
desk
and
call
anoth
mazda
dealership
ask
for
a
salesman
and
began
discus
what
kind
of
price
they
would
consid
a
few
sentenc
into
the
convers
mr
salesmanag
broke
into
the
line
and
began
tell
me
how
rude
he
thought
it
wa
that
i
would
call
anoth
dealership
from
hi
phone
i
said
that
sinc
hed
announc
that
our
busi
wa
over
he
shouldnt
care
and
everi
time
i
tri
to
talk
to
the
other
sale
guy
the
sale
manag
would
drown
out
our
voic
with
hi
own
how
did
he
know
that
i
wa
use
the
phone
anyway
final
i
hung
up
and
we
head
out
of
the
showroom
sale
manag
and
croni
come
out
of
a
littl
unmark
room
and
he
begin
to
berat
u
again
we
say
that
we
wont
bother
him
anymor
were
go
next
door
to
the
nissan
dealership
then
come
the
part
i
wish
i
could
have
videotap
a
we
go
out
the
front
door
the
sale
manag
shout
across
the
entir
showroom
custom
and
all
go
ahead
you
deserv
to
buy
a
nissan
so
my
friend
bought
a
sentra
just
so
the
guilti
wont
go
unpunish
ill
mention
that
the
sale
manag
name
wa
gari
tuson
from
hi
manner
hi
refus
to
come
down
to
a
reason
price
and
hi
anger
at
the
end
my
guess
is
that
he
had
bet
our
origin
salesman
who
wa
a
young
novic
that
hed
be
abl
to
get
at
least
x
dollar
out
of
u
and
he
wa
steam
that
we
wouldnt
fall
for
hi
slimi
trick
