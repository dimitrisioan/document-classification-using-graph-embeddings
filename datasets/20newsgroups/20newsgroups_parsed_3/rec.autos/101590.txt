i
had
drove
it
for
coupl
time
and
i
think

a
great
car
esp
on
snow
howev
when
she
took
it
to
a
local
subaru
dealer
for
a
oil
chang
the
bill
came
out
to
be
about
dollar
the
dealer
told
u
it
is
becaus
to
chang
the
oil
filter
on
a
svx
it
is
necessari
to
disassembl
a
metal
cover
under
the
engin
and
that
took
an
hour
of
labour
at
first
we
think
we
are
be
rip
off
so
she
phone
to
a
dealer
in
toronto
but
found
out
the
they
are
charg
roughli

same
price
so
