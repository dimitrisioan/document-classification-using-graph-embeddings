write
now
now
befor
we
get
too
carri
away
here
keep
in
mind
that
own
ani
car
in
korea
is
a
luxuri
that
onli
the
rule
class
can
afford
everi
govern
agenc
worth
it
salt
find
some
reason
to
levi
a
tax
on
car
ownership
last
i
heard
there
were
seven
differ
fee
to
pay
to
own
a
car
i
believ
thi
is
the
sort
of
petti
bureaucrat
ineffici
that
new
presid
kim
young
sam
want
to
erad
basic
i
think
the
rule
came
into
place
a
bureaucrat
from
plebian
background
want
to
wreak
reveng
on
the
rule
class
in
exchang
zaibatsu
like
hyundai
screw
over
smaller
compani
perpetu
a
viciou
cycl
i
have
faith
that
korean
peopl
can
potenti
build
car
a
well
a
anyon
el
but
for
now
hyundai
car
seem
to
reflect
the
tension
within
societi
of
screwi
compon
that
wont
work
togeth
stubborn
like
a
mule
the
car
either
wont
go
forward
or
wont
stop
at
all
hahahahahaha
gasp
pant
hm
im
not
sure
whether
the
abov
wa
just
a
silli
remark
or
a
seriou
remark
but
in
case
there
are
some
misconcept
i
think
henri
robertson
hasnt
updat
hi
data
file
on
korea
sincemid
s
own
a
car
in
korea
is
no
longer
a
luxuri
most
middl
class
peopl
in
korea
can
afford
a
car
and
do
have
at
least
one
car
the
problem
in
korea
especi
in
seoul
is
that
there
are
just
so
mani
privatelyown
car
a
well
a
taxi
and
buse
the
rushhour
ha
becom
a
hour
phenomenon
and
that
there
is
no
place
to
park
last
time
i
heard
back
in
januari
the
kim
administr
want
to
legisl
a
law
requir
a
potenti
car
owner
to
provid
hi
or
her
own

area
just
like
they
do
in
