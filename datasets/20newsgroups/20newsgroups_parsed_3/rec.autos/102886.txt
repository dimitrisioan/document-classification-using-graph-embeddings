howev
if
i
were
to
design
a
bmw
electron
i
will
use
a
counter
to
count
the
number
of
time
the
car
pass
million
mile
or
whatev
and
store
it
in
the
car
comput
memori
thi
could
be
read
when
do
a
diagnost
test
ditto
for
the
date
of
the
odomet
a
easi
a
thi
is
i
dont
know
whi
manafuctur
dont
do
it
dont
they
to
prevent
illeg
odomet
tamper
but
a
a
previou
writer
said
it
will
in
ani
case
take
aeon
to
reset
an
odomet
mechan
or
electron
by
simul
a
drive
car
it
will
be
easier
to
reprogram
it
how
i
dont
know
it
shouldnt
be
that
hard
if
you
know
much
about
digit
electron
if
the
counter
is
made
with
standard
ttl
chip
all
you
should
need
to
do
is
find
the
chip
use
for
count
figur
out
what
mileag
you
want
to
put
in
and
preset
it
but
wire
the
preset
pin
directli
to
lowhigh
youd
also
have
to
know
what
the
convent
are
for
low
and
high
it
might
be
a
littl
more
involv
than
thi
but
it
shouldnt
be
beyond
someon
with
a
bsee
or
b
eet
all
the
display
doe
is
convert
what
the
counter
chip
say
into
digit
use
a
translat
tabl
store
in
rom
selah
dan
but
those
chip
are
probabl
insid
a
custom
chip
to
make
it
smaller
and
use
le
power
and
the
presetdata
pin
are
not
go
to
be
avail
it
would
probabl
not
be
ttl
but
might
be
cmo
wider
oper
voltag
rang
not
that
the
tecnolog
would
make
much
differ
plu
the
custom
chip
would
probabl
be
