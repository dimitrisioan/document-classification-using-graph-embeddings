right
along
with
the

and
the
car
doe
that
with
small
inch
tire
that
are
all
weather
xgtv
not
to
mention
that
the
integra
ride
alot
better
than
a
beretta
your
acceleart
time
also
vari
magazin
to
magazin
road
track
and
car
driver
have
the
gsr
at
to
for
road
and
track
also
quarter
mile
time
vari
from
to
you
cant
tell
exactli
by
the
number
furthermor
the
integra
will
defin
outrun
the
beretta
on
the
high
end
car
driver
and
road
track
have
the
gsr
do
to
mph
and
it
get
there
fast
so
the
beretta
can
out
handl
the
integra
and
it
can
certainli
keep
up
with
it
in
acceler
and
the
beretta
probabl
ha
a
higher
top
speed
due
to
the
horsepow
advantag
hptorqu
for
the
integra
v
for
the
beretta
you
alway
believ
those
exact
number
whi
dont
you
drive
a
gsr
and
see
for
your
self
while
the
gsr
ha
a
low
torqy
it
high
gear
over
a
rpm
make
up
for
the
differ
still
wouldnt
call
it
a
torqu
moster
though
the
biggest
advantag
would
have
to
be
the
price
the
integra
cost
a
test
motor
trend
the
gtz
cost
a
test
the
gtz
also
ha
standard
niciti
and
airbag
and
antilock
brake
an
airbag
is
not
avail
on
the
integra
and
lower
model
do
not
have
ab
consid
you
save
almost
dollar
for
the
beretta
and
the
quad
is
a
reliabl
engin
it
doesnt
make
sens
to
get
the
integra
a
a
perform
coup
which
is
what
peopl
have
been
tri
to
make
it
out
to
be
quad
reliabl
yeah
what
your
definit
of
reliabl
if
that
reliabl
then
it
safe
to
say
that
integra
engin
in
gener
are
near
perfect
not
to
mention
a
hell
of
alot
smoother
and
quieter
balanc
shaftsth
acura
ha
the
engin
win
the
reliabl
contest
hand
down
you
can
rev
that
car
all
day
everyday
and
youll
never
blow
a
hose
or
crack
the
block
or
anyth
els
i
speak
from
expier
im
not
say
the
quad
is
a
bad
engin
but
dont
highlight
reliabl
when
you
compar
it
to
a
acura
engin
and
while
the
integra
cost
alot
more
it
is
a
better
invest
sinc
it
will
hold
it
valu
consider
much
better
and
doe
a
nice
job
at
be
a
sporti
car
and
practic
at
the
same
time
note
thi
isnt
a
flame
on
the
gtz
or
other
gm
quad
product
the
berreta
is
a
nice
car
and
put
out
respect
perform
and
a
veri
reason
price
not
to
mention
it
ha
an
airbag
but
to
start
quot
figur
from
one
sourc
isnt
too
reliabl
read
other
sourc
and
drive
both
car
while
i
havent
driven
a
gtz
i
have
driven
gt
and
grand
am
with
quad
engin
so
they
are
similair
