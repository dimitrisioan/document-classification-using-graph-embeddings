q
what
is
a

downshift
a
when
downshift
the
engin
must
be
rotat
faster
in
the
lower
gear
than
it
wa
in
the
higher
gear
howev
dure
a
downshift
normal
you
declutch
and
lift
your
foot
from
the
throttl
so
the
rev
drop
rather
than
increas
in
revmatch
downshift
you
blip
the
throttl
befor
reengag
the
clutch
so
that
the
engin
will
alreadi
be
up
to
the
new
speed
thi
result
in
a
much
smoother
and
faster
downshift
q
what
doe
heelandto
mean
a
heelandto
is
a
techniqu
use
to
do
a
revmatch
downshift
while
brake
thi
is
normal
challeng
becaus
you
need
the
right
foot
for
both
the
brake
and
throttl
it
is
call
heelandto
becaus
you
use
one
end
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
other
on
the
throttl
to
match
rev
for
the
downshift
in
mani
modern
car
thi
is
a
misnom
often
you
must
use
the
ball
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
side
on
the
throttl
note
that
some
race
car
driver
will
skip
the
clutch
and
just
use
the
left
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
foot
on
the
throttl
accomplish
the
same
thing
q
what
is
doubleclutch
downshift
a
while
your
right
foot
is
do
the
abov
your
left
foot
can
do
one
of
three
thing
noth
declutch
onc
or
declutch
twice
the
reason
for
declutch
twice
is
to
match
the
speed
of
the
two
shaft
in
the
transmiss
to
the
speed
of
the
engin
thi
is
usual
coupl
with
revmatch
so
that
while
the
engin
is
in
neutral
and
the
clutch
engag
the
throttl
is
blip
and
both
shaft
of
the
transmiss
speed
up
the
procedur
is
a
follow
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
neutral
engag
clutch
match
rev
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
next
lower
gear
engag
clutch
thi
sound
like
a
lot
of
work
but
with
practic
it
becom
natur
the
problem
that
doubleclutch
solv
is
normal
the
function
of
the
synchron
within
the
gearbox
in
transmiss
without
synchro
or
with
veri
worn
synchro
doubleclutch
make
it
much
easier
to
shift
basic
if
you
doubleclutch
well
you
are
not
use
the
synchro
at
all
thi
is
gener
unnecessari
