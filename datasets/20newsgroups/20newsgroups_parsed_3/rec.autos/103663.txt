i
sure
dont
know
what
and
how
they
measur
in
regard
to
diesel
motor
in
car
truck
and
bus
but
i
think
they
are
probabl
measur
the
wrong
pollut
or
at
the
wrong
time
or
both
i
certainli
find
it
offens
to
drive
behind
a
diesel
bu
or
diesel
truck
and
some
diesel
car
they
stink
and
it
alway
rollupthewindow
panic
time
when
one
come
by
or
duck
in
front
of
me
when
i
am
drive
with
my
famili
i
dont
think
the
combust
mixtur
is
kept
under
veri
good
control
in
