my

seem
well
built
and
had
the
featur
we
want
these
are
similar
to
the
featur
you
want
except
for
cruis
control
and
we
want
a
manual
transmiss
and
are
consid
antilock

i
also
hate

we
both
think

the
honda

toyota
camri
were
both
more
expens

in

not

better
we
probabl
gave

to
my

and
a

of
mine
c
the

i
find

veri
uncomfort
and
the
escort
ha
attack
belt

no

bag
well
probabl
end
up
with
a
i
saw
a
dx
with
ac
and
cassett
advertis
for
just
under
washington
post
april
i
think
and
my
local
dealer
say
they
can
match
that
price
i
will
probabl
get
the
mayb
tomorrow
the
main
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
or
not
i
will
have
to
do
a
factori
order
or
prefer
order
to
get
one
with
ab
and
whether
or
not
the
dealership
will
run
the
price
up
a
lot
if
i
do
so
