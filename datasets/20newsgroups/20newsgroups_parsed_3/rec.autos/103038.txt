the
sad
truth

but
it

twoseat

rollov
headlight
hard

and
realli
sporti
look
my
friend

one
sit
in
hi
yard
in
realli
nice
condit
bodywis
but
he
transmiss
ha
seiz
up
on
him

for
a
while
doe
anyon

ani
info
on

the

look
realli
tight
to
work
on
but
it
is
in
fine
shape
and
i
am

thank
darren
gibbon
thi
would
be
the
manta
would
it
not
sold
through
buick
dealer
in
the
mid
s
a
the
price
leader
sound
a
lot
more
like
an
opel
gt
to
me
id
guess
that
thi
is
on
the
same
chassi
a
the
kadett
rather
than
the
bigger
manta
but
i
could
easili
be
wrong
i
think
the
later
kadett
were
sold
here
a
buick
opel
craig
i
think
the
manta
is
the
european
name
for
the
gt
im
pretti
sure
that
the
onli
kadett
sold
here
werear
the
pontiac
leman
i
think
the
gt
is
just
an
earli
