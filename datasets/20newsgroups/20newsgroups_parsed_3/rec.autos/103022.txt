i
cant
help
you
with
your
question
but
i
do
have
a
comment
to
make
concern
aftermarket
ac
unit
i
have
a
frostk
or
frosttemp
forget
which
aftermarket
unit
on
my
cavali
and
am
quit
unhappi
with
it
the
fan
is
noisi
and
doesnt
put
out
much
air
i
will
never
have
an
aftermarket
ac
instal
in
ani
of
my
vehicl
again
i
just
cant
trust
the
qualiti
and
perform
after
thi
experi
le
let
me
add
my
in
i
had
a
ac
instal
by
the
ford
garag
and
it
did
not
work
a
well
a
the
ac
that
wa
instal
by
the
factori
in
pickup
ident
to
mine
i
have
talk
to
other
peopl
that
have
had
the
same
result
dont
know
if
thi
is
just
a
probabl
with
ford
or
what
erni
smith
i
agre
never
have
the
dealer
add
anyth
to
your
car
if
you
want
ac
make
sure
it
is
factori
installedhonda
mayb
exclud
mani
cant
be
bought
with
ac
instal
at
the
factori
but
i
think
mayb
they
actual
use
all
the
need
part
for
a
true
factori
instal
when
they
put
one
ina
in
bigger
radiat
etcor
are
design
properli
for
thi
in
the
st
place
anyway
my
point
is
the
dealer
instal
ac
wont
be
anywher
near
a
good
a
factori
and
the
servic
bum
will
mess
up
your
car
when
instal
it
scratch
screwdriv
hole
in
seatspart
not
reinstal
correctli
or
with
all
the
screw
etc
i
know
a
guy
who
ha
been
servic
manag
at
a
gm
dealer
for
yearsh
said
never
have
a
dealer
add
anyth
to
your
car
except
mayb
floormat
