re
wa
re
safeti
from
how
far
can
you
see
a
car
in
articl
mark
r
poulson
write
the
devil
reincarn
write
you
will
be
surpris
at
the
number
of
peopl
who
forget
their
glass
while
drive
and
then
there
are
the
peopl
who
just
plain
dont
get
their
eye
check
onc
a
year
a
someon
who
ha
lousi
vision
i
can
see
object
at
a
distanc
without
my
glass
howev
they
are
quit
fuzzi
and
i
may
not
be
abl
to
make
out
the
detail
but
i
can
certainli
tell
that
someth
is
there
i
wont
argu
too
much
about
anyth
i
am
probabl
one
of
those
that
think
that
we
cant
have
enough
safeti
on
the
road
i
would
gladli
sacrific
distract
a
you
call
it
than
someon
have
troubl
see
danger
earlier
one
save
life
justifi
more
than
my
lifetim
of
distract
for
me
and
then
there
is
dawn
and
dusk
when
your
eye
have
not
yet
adjust
to
the
poor
light
and
there
are
those
who
drive
blackgrey
car
and
then
there
is
the
case
where
you
are
drive
down
a
twoway
one
lane
road
and
someon
is
overtak
car
and
come
the
opposit
direct
doesnt
see
you
becaus
your
light
are
not
on
or
vice
versa
at
mph
that
is
quit
a
small
reaction
time
but
of
cours
we
are
too
macho
to
think
we
are
invinc
and
can
react
faster
than
that
onli
the
poor
sod
who
you
didnt
see
might
not
have
a
normal
life
ever
i
work
out
the
reaction
time
in
a
previou
post
and
it
plenti
even
for
an
year
old
grandma
a
long
a
speed
are
in
the
mph
rang
or
le
if
you
or
some
other
driver
is
go
way
faster
than
that
then
be
care
a
alway
you
are
respons
for
your
drive
action
if
you
pull
out
to
pa
and
crash
into
someon
for
whatev
reason
it
your
fault
if
you
cant
problem
is
that
i
may
just
kill
the
guy
i
agre
that
i
would
be
at
fault
and
i
will
have
my
licens
revok
whi
i
might
even
go
to
the
ga
chamber
but
the
fact
still
remain
that
the
guy
is
dead
someon
die
becaus
i
wa
too
stingi
to
put
on
my
light
see
a
damn
thing
then
you
shouldnt
be
drive
light
fail
fallen
tree
or
rock
dont
have
light
etc
i
maintain
that
headlight
strength
the
ratio
of
the
probabl
of
fallen
treesrock
on
the
road
to
oncom
traffic
is
too
low
to
even
be
consid
the
differ
is
also
work
on
what
we
know
could
happen
to
what
might
happen
run
light
are
not
necessari
for
motorist
who
drive
around
mph
it
may
be
a
good
idea
to
forc
the
run
or
headlight
on
when
you
turn
your
windshield
wiper
on
but
onli
becaus
some
peopl
are
too
stupid
to
do
so
if
you
crash
into
one
of
those
idiot
you
have
to
fight
it
out
in
court
to
show
hi
negleg
if
you
can
even
prove
it
just
out
of
curios
how
much
gasmilag
do
you
loos
when
you
put
your
light
on
and
how
much
do
you
reduc
the
life
of
your
headlamp
and
what
is
the
cost
of
your
headlamp
anyway
mileag
is
certainli
reduc
but
by
a
veri
veri
small
amount
probabl
about
watt
for
head
and
run
light
thi
is
an
extra
horsepow
that
must
be
made
by
the
engin
it
may
be
that
thi
will
cost
you
around
two
gallon
a
year
but
time
million
car
that
a
lot
of
ga
compar
to
the
number
of
gallon
of
ga
consum
by
those
million
car
it
is
miniscul
whatev
ti
a
piti
i
have
to
share
the
same
road
with
a
person
not
concern
with
safeti
s
lamp
life
is
measur
in
hour
so
if
you
normal
drive
in
half
daylight
and
half
night
your
lamp
will
have
to
be
replac
twice
a
often
headlamp
onli
cost
about
u
for
most
halogen
lamp
the
cost
to
the
individu
is
trivial
and
to
me
is
not
the
issu
what
i
dont
like
is
the
distract
all
these
car
with
headlight
caus
i
dont
need
to
constantli
see
the
headlight
of
the
vehicl
behind
me
i
dont
need
to
see
the
headlight
of
everi
gosh
darn
car
for
a
mile
down
the
road
these
lit
up
car
make
nonillumin
thing
le
visibl
like
pedistrian
and
bike
hope
were
not
go
to
mandat
drl
for
peopl
and
bike
too
a
stream
of
taillight
is
toler
a
are
the
orang
front
run
light
thi
is
certainli
suffici
for
other
peopl
to
see
you
if
they
look
and
doesnt
distract
