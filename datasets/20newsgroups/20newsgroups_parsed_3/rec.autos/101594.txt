a
zeppo
write
in
articl
j
on
cochran
write
id
like
to
add
the
beretta
gtz
a
a
car
which
will
kick
gsr
butt
anyday
and
it
a
lot
cheaper
to
boot
compar
the
gtz
and
gsr
is
appl
to
orang
somewhat
like
a
mustang
and
a
crx
both
have
veri
differ
way
of
do
thing
and
ought
to
appeal
to
differ
buyer
ie
i
dont
think
an
acura
owner
would
be
seen
dead
in
a
chevi
dealership
or
vice
versa
stuff
delet
are
all
weather
xgtv
not
to
mention
that
the
integra
ride
alot
better
than
no
integra
i
have
seen
come
with
allseason
tire
the
gtz
doe
come
with
much
bigger
wheel
along
with
the
integra
and
the
car
doe
that
with
small
inch
tire
that
your
acceleart
time
also
vari
magazin
to
magazin
road
track
and
car
driver
have
the
gsr
at
to
for
road
and
track
the
cd
figur
are
almost
certainli
bogu
and
base
on
a
hot
prototyp
suppli
by
acura
the
mt
figur
are
more
plausibl
also
quarter
mile
time
vari
from
to
sound
reason
probabl
faster
than
regular
integra
so
the
beretta
can
out
handl
the
integra
and
it
can
certainli
keep
up
with
it
in
acceler
and
the
beretta
probabl
ha
a
higher
top
speed
due
to
the
horsepow
advantag
hptorqu
for
the
integra
v
for
the
beretta
you
alway
believ
those
exact
number
whi
dont
you
drive
a
gsr
and
see
for
your
self
while
the
gsr
ha
a
low
torqy
it
high
gear
over
a
the
gsr
gear
is
horribl
for
day
to
day
drive
it
need
a
speed
box
more
than
ani
other
modern
car
essenti
th
in
a
regualr
integra
equal
th
in
the
gsr
and
the
regular
integra
are
veri
buzzi
at
speed
rpm
make
up
for
the
differ
still
wouldnt
call
it
a
torqu
moster
though
consid
you
save
almost
dollar
for
the
beretta
and
the
quad
is
a
reliabl
engin
it
doesnt
make
sen
to
get
the
integra
a
a
the
onli
person
i
knew
with
a
gtz
had
it
bought
back
by
gm
a
a
lemon
it
wa
a
piecv
of
junk
but
veri
quick
for
fwd
quad
reliabl
yeah
what
your
definit
of
reliabl
if
that
reliabl
then
it
safe
to
say
that
integra
engin
in
gener
are
near
perfect
the
onli
gsr
owner
i
know
had
the
engin
throw
a
rod
with
le
than
k
mile
a
rare
screw
up
by
honda
both
the
gtz
and
gsr
are
flaw
car
the
perform
enthusiast
would
take
the
gtz
and
the
cr
purchas
would
be
the
gsr
craig
