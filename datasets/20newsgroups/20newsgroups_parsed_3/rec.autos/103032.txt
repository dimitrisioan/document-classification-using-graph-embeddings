day
write
relat
an
experi
similar
to
mine
then
come
the
part
i
wish
i
could
have
videotap
a
we
go
out
the
front
door
the
sale
manag
shout
across
the
entir
showroom
custom
and
all
go
ahead
you
deserv
to
buy
a
nissan
so
my
friend
bought
a
sentra
thi
kind
of
behavior
is
what
i
wa
shock
by
in
my
experi
for
cri
out
loud
how
do
these
turkey
think
they
can
talk
to
custom
thi
way
and
still
stay
in
busi
again
i
dont
expect
sale
peopl
to
bow
scrape
and
grovel
in
my
presenc
but
i
sure
dont
expect
to
be
abus
either
i
wa
veri
surpris
by
the
way
the
sale
peopl
talk
to
me
and
in
other
negoti
session
i
overheard
in
neighbor
sale
cubicl
evid
their
success
rate
is
high
enough
that
they
continu
to
do
busi
thi
way
there
must
be
a
lot
of
peopl
out
there
who
are
easi
to
intimid
on
the
other
hand
im
not
sure
about
the
one
price
no
haggl
approach
that
saturn
and
other
are
start
to
use
i
guess
if
their
fix
price
is
fair
it
ok
mayb
the
best
approach
is
to
do
your
homework
befor
you
go
in
find
out
the
invoic
price
of
the
car
add
a
reason
profit
for
the
dealer
offer
them
that
price
and
stick
to
it
if
they
get
abus
just
leav
then
dont
let
them
tri
to
screw
you
after
the
deal
is
agre
on
mark
