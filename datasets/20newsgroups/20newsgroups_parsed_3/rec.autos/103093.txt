much
faster
in
defens
of
the
driver
who
are
in
the
right
lane

state
peopl
simpli
do
not
expect
when
they
are
drive
to
be
overtaken
at
a
speed
differenti
of
mph
i
dont

of
car
base
on
a
speed
differenti
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
to
drive
in
the
left
lane
fast
but
when
i
overtak
car
who
are
on
the
right
i
slow
down
a
tad
bit
if
i
were
to
reli
on
the
judgement
of
the
other
car
to
recogn
the
speed
