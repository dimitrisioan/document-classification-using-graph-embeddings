made
the
point
veri
well
when
my
wife

i
were
in
our
s
we
did
the
convert
thing
with
triumph
now
in
our
mid
we
still
appreci
the
open
air
but
prefer
targa
type
there
is
much
le
wind
nois
objectspap
blow
around
foreign
object
get
into
the
car
and
one
still
ha
almost
all
the
advantag
of
the
convert
my

just
dont
cut
it
there
no
substitut
for
a
convert
if

beat
down
on
you
the
wind
in
your
hair
and
teeth
the
flopsum

get
in
the
car
and
the
nois
associ
with
the
whoosh
of
the
