there
is
a
tool
avail
to
reset
the
servic
indic
on
bmw
but
the
light
will
come
back
on
after

the
tool
is
in
fact
illeg
in
europ
atleast
it
is
often
the
case
that
the
unsuspect
punter
trot
off
to
buy
a
use
bmw
and
a
few
week
later
all
the
light
come
on
other
than
that
i
know
of
no
other
tool
anyon
els
about
chang
oil
everi
mile
that
ok
on
newer
audi
they
onli
requir
it
after
everi
mile
i
am
talk
about
an
oil
chang
just
a
queri
do
you
drive
your
car
veri
veri
care
like
no
sudden
acceler
etc
if
yeah
then
the
m
oil
chang
seem
quit
reason
but
if
you
drive
kinda
fast
id
get
a
bit
up
tight
abot
that
thingi
a
point
to
note
just
becaus
the
first
light
came
on
at
k
doesnt
mean
all
the
other
will
come
on
everi
k
too
shaz
shaz
hmm
but
the
servic
indic
that
i
have
work
thi
way
there
are
green
yellow
red
indic
initi
all
green
indic
will
be
on
for
few
minut
when
you
start
your
car
the
comput
will
actual
sens
how
you
drive
your
car
and
a
time
go
by
the
green
indic
will
start
to
go
off
one
by
one
and
then
the
yellow
indic
will
turn
on
and
then
the
red
indic
will
go
on
and
you
should
get
servic
when
by
the
time
green
indic
are
off
after
servic
the
mechanicor
you
will
reset
the
servic
indic
and
the
comput
start
count
again
so
i
expect
to
have
a
toolor
a
procedur
to
reset
it
so
the
green
light
will
come
on
and
the
yellow
and
red
light
will
go
off

can
do
oil
chang
themself
without
know
how
to
reset
the
indic
it
the
first
european
car
i
have
and
chang
oil
at
mile
is
a
surpris
to
me
and
it
a
big
plu
but
i
wonder
how
that
could
happen
sinc
the
oil
lose
it
lubric
abil
over
time
i
thought
it
the
oil
and
not
the
vehicl
that
determin
how
often
we
should
chang
oil
ani
bmw
owner
on
the
net
respons
welcom
p
my
initi
question
is
how
do
