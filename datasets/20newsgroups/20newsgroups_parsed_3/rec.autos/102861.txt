re
too
fast
wharfi
write
compar
either
to
the
porsch
and
you
tell
me
which
wa
design
oh
right
onli
dollar
car
should
be
driven
fast
they
drive
goddamn
rabbit
at
mph
in
europ
pal
and
i
reckon
a
tauru
is
at
least
a
capabl
a
a
rabbit
my
whole
point
wa
not
to
say
that
the
car
couldnt
go
that
fast
but
that
they
shouldnt
go
that
fast
a
famili
sedan
design
to
be
oper
at
mph
doesnt
suddenli
becom
oper
at
mph
becaus
you
ad
some
plastic
aero
effect
slightli
wider
tire
and
a
much
larger
engin
that
what
the
sho
is
a
slightli
modifi
famili
sedan
with
a
power
engin
they
didnt
even
bother
improv
the
brake
the
mustang
is
essenti
the
same
deal
a
the
sho
a
big
power
plant
stuck
in
a
midsiz
sedan
with
almost
no
other
modif
i
have
reallif
experi
with
the
mustang
it
handl
like
a
brick
except
when
your
invok
overst
of
cours
someth
i
person
avoid
do
on
the
highway
and
stop
power
is
inadequ
even
from
mph
lot
of
acceller
but
the
rest
of
the
car
is
not
up
to
par
i
pick
the
porsch
exampl
becaus
they
are
design
with
speed
in
mind
it
didnt
have
to
be
the
it
could
have
been
the
much
cheaper
or
one
of
sever
merced
or
audi
model
all
of
these
car
are
fairli
expens
but
so
are
the
part
that
make
them
drivabl
at
high
speed
thi
should
be
elementari
there
are
a
few
thing
to
keep
in
mind
about
europ
sinc
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledg
is
admittedli
secondhand
but
i
believ
the
follow
to
be
true
driver
are
much
better
disciplin
in
europ
than
they
are
here
the
road
compris
the
autobahn
are
much
better
design
than
they
are
here
and
usual
includ
anim
fenc
thi
make
them
far
more
predict
than
most
u
highway
not
all
of
europ
is
the
autobahn
most
place
in
europ
have
speed
limit
that
arent
outoflin
with
what
we
use
to
have
in
the
u
if
my
friend
werent
lie
to
me
theyr
typic
not
much
higher
than

i
strongli
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owner
do
mph
nearli
kmh
on
the
autobahn
but
i
could
be
wrong
some
peopl
have
no
respect
for
their
