whi
the
hell
do
you
think
that
lh
ha
been
nicknam
last
hope
you
can
do
better
and
i
know
peopl
will
disagre
with
me
here
but
japanes
like
honda
or
toyota
or
the
onli
american
car
compani
that
i
feel
is
a
qualiti
product
saturn
i
will
not
touch
anoth
chrysler
product
again
no
way
i
dont
care
how
good
the
lh
car
look
good
and
i
will
admit
they
look
promis
but
not
with
the
support
that
you
get
gm
isnt
much
better
thank
god
they
dont
control
saturn
like
they
do
their
divis
or
it
would
be
just
anoth
market
ploy
dont
get
me
wrong
i
will
be
watch
my
car
which
i
do
like
like
a
hawk
for
the
next
year
i
am
much
more
hesit
to
say
it
or
ani
car
is
realli
good
until
it
ha
prove
itself
to
me
but
sinc
someon
els
point
out
cd
a
a
sourc
i
will
note
becaus
i
use
to
read
these
magazin
that
car
and
driver
ha
never
had
a
good
thing
to
say
about
most
chrysler
product
shadow
for
one
alway
were
they
moan
about
the
regurit
kcar
and
engin
wherea
motor
trend
alway
thought
they
were
great
car
no
car
magazin
is
realli
object
and
although
there
are
alot
of
peopl
who
dont
like
consum
report
i
will
use
them
to
reinforc
my
argument
i
alreadi
know
about
the
big
stink
with
the
saturn
crash
test
time
will
tell
how
good
a
car
they
are
the
shadowsund
rate
much
wors
than
averag
in
fact
none
of
the
chrysler
rate
a
better
than
averag
i
think
the
best
one
is
just
averag
exclud
the
diamond
starmitsubishi
stuff
and
the
lh
you
can
find
bad
stuff
about
the
shadow
tri
a
i
might
when
i
research
the
saturn
i
could
not
find
anyth
bad
about
it
there
is
a
great
deal
of
inform
about
thi
compani
just
becaus
it
is
a
new
american
compani
and
it
ha
creat
quit
a
stir
in
the
automot
commun
for
good
reason
much
more
than
the
introduct
of
ani
new
model
line
of
ani
establish
compani
i
read
an
articl
which
had
a
subcolumn
an
i
think
thi
imprint
on
me
more
than
anyth
els
some
big
wig
in
toyota
said
and
i
quot
we
are
watch
them
veri
close
come
on
everybodi
grow
up
the
foreign
car
especi
the
japanes
have
been
kick
our
butt
for
good
reason
the
american
car
compani
could
not
make
a
good
product
or
support
the
custom
the
way
they
want
these
day
to
set
in
their
way
which
is
one
of
the
reason
saturn
wa
creat
they
are
still
struggl
becaus
they
havent
learn
yet
they
have
the
abil
the
worker
are
not
inferior
the
technolog
is
not
out
of
date
but
their
attitud
is
and
they
are
just
find
thi
out
it
call
competit
gentlemanwomen
if
you
dont
satisfi
the
demand
of
the
consum
