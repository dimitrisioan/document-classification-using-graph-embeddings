how
true
is
it
that
a
fuel

do
much
more
good
than

use
deterg
ga
while
i
a
fuel
injector
clean
at
the
dealer
is
probabl
littl
more
than
them
open
your
ga
tank
dump
in
a
bottl
of
fuel
injector
cleaner
and
send
you
on
your
merri
way
poorer
go
to
kmart
and
buy
the
cleaner
yourself
for
thi
should
not
be
the
case
if

the

dure
the
