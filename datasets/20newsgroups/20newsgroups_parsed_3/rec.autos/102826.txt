jeff

write
the
biggest
hurdl
for
automat
imho
is
not
shift
speed
per
se
but
rather
the
transmiss
reaction
speed
when
you
tri
to
forc
it
to
shift
manual
i
rent
an
oldsmobil
achieva
is
that
a
yuppi
name
or
what
and
a
nissan
stanza
they
both
had
automat
im
a
manual
transmiss
bigot
but
i
have
to
admit
that
the
transmiss
on
these
car
were
better
shifter
than
i
am
and
ye
they
respond
veri
quickli
to
kickdown
request
the
nissan

a
tachomet
so
i
wa
abl
to
figur
out
which

dont
rememb
i
believ

foot
told
it
no

realli
want
to
acceler
