figur
that
mph
collis
into
brick
wall
arent
common
enough
for
me
to
spend
that
much
extra
money
for
protect
but
there
are
lot
of
lowspe
collis
that
do
worri
me
get
into
an
mph
accid
and
you
may
reconsid
ive
been
in
one
and
it
is
realli
scarey
my
life
is
someth
i
valu
more
than
a
car
look
or
handel
consid
it
insur
it
may
not
happen
often
but
when
it
doe
youll
sure
be
glad
you
got
a
safe
car
grant
the
test
arent
perfect
but
id
much
rather
be
in
a
car
that
did
well
in
the
test
than
a
car
that
did
horribl
you
rais
a
valid
point
but
again
it
a
tradeoff
how
much
money
do
you
want
to
spend
for
that
kind
of
protect
you
could
buy
a
volvo
saab
or
benz
and
get
realli
good
crash
protect
and
other
luxuri
but
youll
pay
significantli
more
for
it
in
my
case
it
out
of
the
question
becaus
all
of
those
car
are
beyond
my
budget
even
in
highspe
headon
collis
the
most
benefici
item
you
can
have
is
a
good
old
point
seatbelt
nowaday
at
least
in
the
u
you
get
an
airbag
if
you
get
a
point
belt
so
presum
you
get
an
ad
safeti
benefit
there
a
well
that
someth
i
certainli
look
for
and
which
can
be
had
in
inexpens
