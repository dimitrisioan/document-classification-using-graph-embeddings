ask

thi
question
if

lot
of

manufactur
provid
a
mile
warrante
with
they
vehicl
i
own
an
diesel
suburban
the
l
diesel
is
a
great
engin
just
keep
go
it
wa
more
expens
when
new
than
the
gasolin
engin
vehicl
wa
the
onli
problem
with
diesel
engin
is
that
when
they
need
to
be
rebuilt
they
are
expens
in
a
ga
engin
you
will
pay
about
for
a
rebuild
diesel
l
is
about
but
then
again
the
diesel
engin
last
about
twice
a
long
and
get
about
better
mileag
a
carbur
for
a
gasolin
engin
cost
about
to
rebuild
or
le
a
rebuild
of
the
fuel
inject
pump
on
a
diesel
will
cost
about
or
more
but
then
again
you
never
need
a
tuneup
if
your
look
at
a
rebuilt
l
id
say
you
got
a
great
deal
check
to
see
if
the
fuel
inject
pump
wa
rebuilt
also
good
luck
