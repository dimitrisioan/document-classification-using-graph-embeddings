a

at
a

and
a

determin

are
mail

the
owner
of
the
vehicl
becaus
of
the
low
power
and
the
degre
angl
mani
peopl
believ
that
a
radar
detector
can
not
give
reason
warn
of
a
ka
band
radar
unit
although
some
manufactur
of
radar
detector
have
ad
such
capabl
anyway
the
number
of
local
where
photoradar
is
in
use
is
limit
and
some
question
the
legal
of
such
unit
best
advic
learn
what
photo
radar
unit
look
like
and
keep
track
of
where
they
are
use
or
els
dont
speed
photo
radar
and
mail
ticket
make
no
sens
at
all
speed
is
a
move
violat
commit
by
the
oper
not
the
owner
the
owner
may
be
a
rental
agenc
a
dealer
a
privat
parti
or
a
govern
agenc
a
long
a
the
owner
ha
no
reason
to
expect
the
oper
will
be
drive
illeg
or
unsaf
the
owner
can
not
be
held
respons
for
what
the
oper
doe
the
car
may
even
have
been
driven
without
the
owner
knowledg
or
consent
i
cant
believ
a
mail
ticket
where
the
driver
is
not
identifi
would
stand
up
in
court
thi
is
obvious
a
lazi
cynic
bonehead
fascist
way
to
extort
revenu
and
ha
noth
to
do
with
public
safeti
bk
we
had
those
fg
photoradar
thing
here
in
sweden
a
while
ago
there
wa
a
lot
of
fuzz
about
them
and
a
lot
of
sabotag
too
a
spraycan
with
touchup
paint
can
do
a
lot
of
good
eventu
they
had
to
drop
the
idea
a
there
were
a
lot
of
courtcas
where
the
owner
of
the
car
could
prove
he
didnt
drive
it
at
the
time
of
speed
i
especi
recal
a
case
where
it
eventu
prove
to
be
a
carthief
that
had
stolen
a
car
and
made
fals
plate
he
ofcours
chose
a
licens
number
of
a
ident
car
so
the
photo
seem
correct
in
conclos
photoradar
suck
everi
way
you
look
at
it
marku
