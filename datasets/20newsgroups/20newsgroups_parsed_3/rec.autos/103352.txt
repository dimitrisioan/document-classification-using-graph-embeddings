same
brake
similar
spring
etc
late
s
wa
a
bad
year
for
gm
reliabl
catastroph
convert
wa
ad
in
cheapest
corvett
to
low
end
about
k
top
out
about
k
except
for
those
morooon
that
think
there
indi
th
anivers
vett
is
special
these
guy
have
been
known
to
ask
k
i
dont
think
they
get
it
best
buy
convert
i
got
my
for
k
need
bodi
work
but
im
will
part
for
all
are
readili
avail
at
swap
meet
and
mail
order
etc
v
reliabl
look
independ
suspens
wheel
disk
and
all
under
k
and
they
thought
a
miata
wa
a
good
deal
also
what
would
insur
look
like
im
male
singl
i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the
car
lower
insur
would
the
fact
that
i
mainli
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rare
driven
insur
class
for
drive
it
under
k
mile
per
year
my
dad
ha
a
vett
and
it
on
what
you
say
classic
insur
basic
what
that
mean
is
that
it
ha
restrict
amount
of
drive
time
which
basic
mean
it
cant
be
use
a
an
everi
day
car
and
would
probabl
suit
your
need
for
limit
mileag
my
origion
inquir
to
my
insur
agent
i
can
drive
my
convert
for
mile
or
le
per
year
i
must
keep
it
in
a
lock
garag
and
it
will
cost
me
of
the
state
valu
per
year
doe
thi
sound
right
ive
also
been
look
at
vett
recent
and
found
a
convert
that
i
like
at
a
dealer
i
current
own
an
ford
escort
gt
which
is
insur
through
state
farm
i
call
em
up
and
ask
about
the
rate
if
i
sell
the
escort
the
vett
insur
is
per
month
if
i
keep
the
escort
the
vett
insur
is
per
month
the
escort
insur
goe
down
by
to
approx
per
month
im
male
and
have
a
good
driver
discount
anoth
variabl
would
be
where
you
live
best
bet
is
to
just
call
up
some
insur
broker
and
get
a
quot
state
farm
say
they
base
the
price
on
the
fair
market
valu
of
the
car
which
is
determin
by
an
outsid
apprasi
they
look
in
the
newspap
and
call
up
dealer
to
find
out
what
the
go
rate
is
and
adjust
it
for
the
condit
of
the
car
to
get
the
valu
abov
they
went
on
the
sell
price
of
the
car
the
dealer
ask
price
is
i
need
to
do
research
to
find
out
if
thi
is
reason
in
ani
case
i
told
state
farm
the
valu
wa
k
get
an
apprais
to
look
at
the
car
he
will
check
serial
number
and
look
for
origion
equip
depend
on
what
mod
have
been
done
the
car
could
be
worth
onli
k
problem
like
wrong
engin
tran
wrong
paint
type
vett
use
lacquer
an
modif
would
reduc
tthe
valu
but
your
look
for
a
car
to
drive
right
thi
sound
like
a
ball
park
price
for
a
smallblock
cu
in
manual
no
air
car
a
would
put
it
closer
to
k
get
it
apprais
for
insur
