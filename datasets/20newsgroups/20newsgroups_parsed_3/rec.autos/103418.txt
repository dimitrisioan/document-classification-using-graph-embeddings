the
rule
of

now
now
befor
we
get

carri
away
here
keep
in
mind
that

is
a
luxuri
that

to
levi
a

ownership
last
i
heard
there
were
seven
differ
fee

of
petti
bureaucrat
ineffici
that

sam
want
to
erad
basic
i
think
the
rule
came
into
place
a
bureaucrat
from
plebian
background
want
to
wreak
reveng
on
the
rule
class
in
exchang
zaibatsu
like
hyundai

perpetu
a
viciou
cycl
i
have
faith
that
korean
peopl
can
potenti
build
car
a
well
a
anyon
el
but
for
now
hyundai
car
seem
to
reflect
the
tension
within
societi
of
screwi
compon
that
wont
work
togeth
stubborn
like
a
mule
the
car
either
wont
go
forward
or
wont
stop
at
all
