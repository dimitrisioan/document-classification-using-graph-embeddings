re
pennsylvania
insur
limit
tort
option
in
my
opinion
the
limit
tort
option
is
the
best
thing
casey
ha
ever
done
basic
limit
tort
mean
that
you
give
up
your
right
to
sue
for
pain
and
suffer
unless
one
of
the
follow
condit
is
met
your
medic
bill
result
from
the
accid
exceed
x
where
x
is
some
number
like
im
not
sure
of
the
exact
number
the
accid
wa
caus
by
a
drunk
driver
i
mean
the
other
driver
wa
drunk
you
get
a
good
lawyer
and
have
a
good
case
basic
you
can
appeal
to
regain
your
right
to
sue
but
there
almost
no
chanc
of
thi
ever
happen
you
are
onli
give
up
your
right
to
sue
for
pain
and
suffer
you
can
still
sue
for
medic
cost
actual
damag
etc
by
agre
to
limit
tort
you
are
essenti
give
up
your
right
to
be
an
asshol
who
treat
everi
accid
a
an
entri
into
the
litig
lotteri
in
exchang
you
get
a
substanti
reduct
in
your
rate
i
save
year
unfortun
the
insur
compani
have
manag
to
scare
and
confus
peopl
so
much
that
onli
about
of
pennsylvanian
go
for
limit
tort
i
guess
that
ok
if
more
peopl
opt
for
it
the
insur
compani
would
be
push
harder
for
repeal
