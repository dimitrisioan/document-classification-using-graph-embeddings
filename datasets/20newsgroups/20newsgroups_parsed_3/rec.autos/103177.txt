how
about
the
thousand
of
kind
teenag
who
volunt
at
local
agenc
to
help
child
senior
the
homeless
hear
hear
thank
robbi
you
also
dont
read
that
much
about
violenc
against
teenag
such
a
georg
bush
buri
aliv
ten
of
thousand
of
unarm
iraqi
yearold
who
were
tri
to
surrend
with
bulldoz
on
the
other
hand
i
think
it
is
true
without
singl
out
teenag
for
blame
that
violenc
is
more
social
accept
than
it
use
to
be
those
of
u
whod
like
to
discourag
violenc
have
plenti
of
work
to
do
with
peopl
of
all
age
well
thi
isnt
the
right
group
for
thi
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
dont
think
violenc
is
ani
more
social
accept
now
by
ani
mean
how
can
you
say
that
when
we
use
to
have
of
pistoltot
gunsling
a
hero
or
even
gangland
thug
be
consid
romant
do
you
think
our
great
grandpar
got
yell
at
by
their
parent
for
play
cowboy
and
indian
i
dont
think
so
that
behavior
wa
somewhat
encourag
back
then
in
fact
i
think
the
onli
differ
between
now
and
then
is
that
nowaday
when
some
teenag
kill
anoth
one
in
a
classroom
in
california
we
here
about
it
in
ma
the
same
day
back
in
the
old
day
theyd
never
hear
about
someth
like
that
period
yeah
peopl
act
realli
shock
about
violenc
a
though
it
were
new
to
our
speci
what
about
the
holocaust
the
crusad
the
salem
witch
trial
the
religi
persecut
of
the
middleag
what
about
violent
act
carri
out
in
the
name
of
religion
all
over
the
world
what
about
the
earli
christian
put
to
death
by
the
roman
the
jew
persecut
by
christian
there
are
a
lot
more
human
today
than
there
have
ever
been
i
do
not
know
the
stat
but
there
are
far
more
peopl
on
the
planet
than
there
were
or
hundr
year
ago
the
per
caput
act
of
violenc
are
probabl
not
significantli
differ
than
they
were
a
hundr
or
a
thousand
year
ago
there
is
noth
new
about
violenc
rf
