hello
auto
enthusiast
i
recent
had
more
car
mangl
broken
into
and
decid
to
get
an
alarm
instal
it
a
viper
and
ha
a
shock
sensor
sensor
for
each
door
ignit
cutoff
and
automat
door
lock
i
have
thi
same
alarm
instal
in
my
syclon
it
work
great
the
shock
sensor
is
veri
sensit
but
much
more
practic
than
the
motion
sensor
i
have
on
my
other
car
it
doesnt
trigger
if
the
car
is
rock
gentli
by
the
wind
but
ani
kind
of
shock
set
it
off
even
kick
the
tire
set
it
off
it
work
great
what
worri
me
is
the
hood
and
hatch
if
someon
could
pri
them
up
gentli
enough
then
they
could
bypass
the
alarm
the
shock
sensor
is
adjust
and
there
are
two
cycl
on
it
you
can
adjust
it
to
be
sensit
enough
that
there
is
no
way
you
could
open
the
hood
without
set
off
the
alarm
although
i
know
that
you
can
not
pop
the
hood
on
the
syclon
without
set
off
my
alarm
now
and
yet
i
have
had
zero
none
fals
alarm
with
thi
system
the
alarm
tell
you
when
you
disarm
it
whether
it
ha
been
activ
in
your
absenc
i
have
been
abl
to
trace
everi
alarm
to
it
caus
and
it
wa
not
a
fals
alarm
im
also
wonder
how
easi
it
would
be
for
a
thief
to
crawl
underneath
the
car
and
cut
the
batteri
cabl
to
disabl
the
alarm
i
guess
it
would
be
possibl
depend
on
the
vehicl
my
syclon
is
so
tight
in
the
engin
compart
that
it
would
be
tough
to
do
thi
there
are
supplement
power
suppli
you
can
put
on
with
thi
viper
alarm
but
i
dont
have
one
i
realli
think
that
if
someon
want
my
car
that
bad
the
alarm
wont
keep
them
from
it
even
with
a
supplement
power
suppli
viper
also
sell
some
fanci
field
disturb
sensor
that
supposedli
detect
peopl
approcah
the
car
thi
is
primarili
for
convert
i
have
a
convert
and
have
look
at
thi
featur
in
detail
alpin
actual
make
a
better
radar
unit
if
you
want
to
get
one
of
these
it
ha
zone
in
it
that
can
be
shut
down
independ
so
that
if
one
side
of
your
car
ha
pedestrian
traffic
or
someth
els
that
would
trigger
an
alarm
it
shut
down
the
zone
or
rather
pull
it
in
tighter
i
dont
see
the
real
benefit
to
these
unless
you
have
a
convert
that
you
leav
the
top
down
on
avoid
the
voic
alarm
that
can
be
ad
to
the
radar
packag
it
talk
to
peopl
a
they
walk
by
i
saw
one
instal
on
a
lotu
esprit
the
kid
would
taunt
it
see
how
close
they
could
get
befor
it
warn
them
to
get
back
the
owner
final
disabl
it
which
defeat
the
purpos
in
my
mind
im
interest
in
the
opinion
of
you
netter
about
these
problem
and
about
the
viper
in
gener
i
am
real
happi
with
my
viper
one
other
featur
i
realli
like
is
you
can
tune
it
to
your
prefer
you
can
have
it
arm
passiv
or
not
you
can
disabl
the
chirp
for
armingdisarm
you
can
have
it
lockunlock
the
door
when
the
alarm
is
armeddisarm
i
like
these
featur
i
hate
the
chirp
when
the
alarm
armsdisarm
so
mine
flash
the
light
onli
i
like
the
door
lock
featur
although
i
have
to
be
care
to
take
my
key
with
me
becaus
it
doesnt
know
if
you
have
left
your
key
in
the
car
when
it
passiv
arm
and
lock
the
door
but
if
you
are
meticul
about
take
your
key
with
you
it
take
care
of
the
rest
the
car
is
an
ford
probe
gt
that
use
to
be
in
great
shape
ron
garnett
i
look
serious
at
the
alpin
system
too
it
is
a
real
nice
system
but
more
money
and
it
ha
a
motion
sensor
standard
instead
of
the
shock
sensor
the
shock
sensor
is
betterand
the
viper
shock
sensor
is
better
cycl
than
the
option
alpin
one
imho
i
think
the
viper
give
you
a
lot
of
good
valu
for
the
money
but
it
isnt
absolut
tamperproof
no
system
is
except
mayb
the
one
that
jame
bond
had
on
hi
lotu
in
for
your
eye
onli
anyon
know
where
we
can
get
one
of
those
instal
mayb
that
wa
what
they
had
in
the
van
in
the
world
trade
center
