the
qualiti

is
someth
of
a
myth
the

funni
everywher

i
wont
even
get
into
how
much

and
local
except
to
say
that
there
are
some

here
a

im
not

what
you
call
quit

deviat
but
i
suspect
everi

would
be
consid
so
theyr
hard
to
take
at

that
not

but
it
one

is
pretti
much
an

you
cant
assum
that
everywher
ha
road
in
such
