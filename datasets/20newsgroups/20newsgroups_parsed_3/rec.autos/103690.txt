write
none
of
the
configur
are
perfectli
inher
balanc
which
is
what
i
wa
talk
about
balanc
shaft
and
mass
on
either
end
of
the
crank
can
elimin
these
forcesmo
which
is
someth
i
also
point
out
and
didnt
you
also
say
that
it
wa
easier
to
add
mass
than
to
add
balanc
shaft
the
sad
truth
is
that
some
maker
dont
bother
to
put
balanc
shaft
on
their
big
shaki

how
about
if
thi
is
ridicul
kindli
explain
whi
it
been
more
than
year
sinc
i
studi
thi
stuff
flat
s
and
is
both
have
the
potenti
to
be
nearli
vibrat
free
becaus
subaru
doe
that
ha
noth
to
do
with
is
in
gener
or
porsch
i
think
subaru
somehow
connect
themselv
to
porsch
is
an
absurd
and
im
not
a
porsch
fan
big
wing
ding
these
configur
overhead
cam
etc
etc
etc
have
been
around
for
nearli
year
the
point
that
they
are
tri
to
make
is
that
while
everybodi
settl
for
the
orthodox
inlin
they
are
use
a
horizont
oppos
which
is
uniqu
in
that
market
segment
and
porsch
also
us
a
flat
six
in
their
so
what
the
problem
i
dont
see
ani
claim
that
their
engin
is
a
good
a
a
porsch
they
are
simpli
point
out
that
they
use
the
same
configur
a
a
porsch
if
you
want
to
nitpick
ad
campaign
i
think
there
are
far
more
blatant
excess
than
thi
eliot
