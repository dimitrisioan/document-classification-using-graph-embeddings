aliv
ten
of
thousand
of
unarm
iraqi
yearold
who
were
tri
to
surrend
with
bulldoz
on
the
other
hand
i
think
it
is
true
without
singl
out
teenag
for
blame
that
violenc
is
more
social
accept
than
it
use
to
be
those
of
u
whod

discourag
violenc
have
plenti
of
work
to
do
with
peopl
of
all

well
thi
isnt
the
right
group
for
thi
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
dont
think
violenc
is
ani
more
social
accept

say
that
when

use
to
have

or
even
gangland
thug

consid
romant

great
grandpar
got
yell
at

their
parent
