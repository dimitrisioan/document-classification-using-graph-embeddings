gsr
quad
reliabl

your
definit
of
reliabl
if
that
reliabl
then
it
safe
to
say
that
integra

in
gener

near
perfect
not

a
hell
of
alot
smoother
and
quieter
balanc

rev
that

all
day
everyday
and
youll
never
blow
a
hose
or
crack
the
block
or
anyth
els
i
speak
from
expier
im
not
say
the
quad
is
a
bad
engin
but
dont
highlight
reliabl
when
you

it
to
a
acura
engin
and
while
the
integra
cost
alot
more
it
is
a
a
coupl
of
thing
blow
a
hose
doesnt
speak
of
engin
reliabl
and
while
it
is
true
that
quad
have
a
problem
with
head
gasket
leak
that
wa
a
design
flaw
in

have
found
my
quad
to
be
complet
solid
and
the
direct
ignit
system
