write
i
am
the
person
who
start
out
thi
subject
to
me
the
question
realli
is
not
about
dealer
profit
but
the
amount
of
money
for
the
type
of
car
ive
settl
with
a
new
subaru
wagon
with
the
similar
amount
of
money
a
saturn
dealer
ask
for
a
sw
ok
i
know
it
a
model
but
i
think
i
got
a
better
car
though
i
have
to
adjust
my
initi
idea
of
whi
i
am
get
a
new
car
today
dure
a
convers
with
a
friend
i
learn
he
reject
a
saturn
for
a
ford
tarur
a
it
onli
cost
him
a
littl
bit
more
than
a
sl
i
may
be
wrong
but
a
load
taru
beat
a
saturn
sl
i
agre
that
a
fullyload
sl
would
come
close
in
price
to
a
lowerend
ford
tauru
a
fullyload
tauru
on
the
other
hand
would
still
be
substanti
more
expens
than
even
the
most
glitzi
sl
a
fulli
load
sl
would
run
somewher
around
while
a
fulli
load
tauru
lx
would
be
somewher
around
the
rang
a
base
tauru
gl
i
believ
might
start
around
of
cours
there
is
the
tauru
sho
which
can
push
if
you
realli
tri
but
thi
is
a
total
differ
car
than
your
mainstream
tauru
sedan
your
statement
wa
not
entir
faulti
just
a
littl
inaccur
i
cant
see
saturn
is
of
better
valu
and
that
is
whi
i
wa
puzzl
by
it
price
oh
we
did
not
spend
much
time
get
our
deal
be
better
inform
ha
it
advantag
well
that
ok
at
least
your
not
bitch
about
dealer
profit
like
some
of
the
other
netter
are
you
seem
to
have
ration
pick
out
the
car
that
is
best
for
you
the
loyal
is
an
age
design
that
is
about
to
be
replac
by
the
impreza
wagon
so
you
probabl
got
a
good
deal
on
one
of
the
last
one
then
again
i
may
be
wrong
