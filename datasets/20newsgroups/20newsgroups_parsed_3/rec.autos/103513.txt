purchas
tradit
wisdom
say
you
are
almost
certainli
better
off
sell
it
yourself
if
you
dont
mind
that
extra
hassl

want
the
retail

california
a
better
way
of
find
out
how
much
your

be
worth
is
to
call
around
and
see
what
it
sell

or
look
in
local
paper
for
similar
car
and
check
out
the
price
it
might
be
more
time
effici
to
take
a
small
loss
rather
than
hold
out
for
month
for
the
best
price
an
acquaint
ha
offer
to
give
me
blue
book
valu
for
the
car
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
an
acquaint
but
i
would
make
darn
sure
that
i
wa
paid
that
is
cashier
check
in
full
befor
deliveri
there
a
real
temptat
when
sell
to
a
pseudofriend
to
be
more
accomod
than
you
should
make
sure
you
get
the
money
and
if
they
hedg
about
pay
in
full
at
the
start
with
a
cashier
check
or
cash
then
i
would
go
elsewher
rememeb
that
you
can
probabl
sell
your
car
to
a
use
car
lot
or
wholesal
and
get
wholesal
bluebook
that
probabl
a
safer
approach
than
sell
to
a
privat
parti
