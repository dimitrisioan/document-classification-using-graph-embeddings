i
agre
with

even
though
the
saturn
ha
prove
to
be
a
veri
reliabl
car
so
far
a
littl
money
spent
now
is
worth
the
peac
of
mind
thi
is
an
interest
point
some
peopl
are
not
realli
buy
the
coverag
they
are
buy
peac

market
folk
love
sell
that
i
suggest
that
peopl
choos
to
not
engag
their
mind
in
peaceless
worri
rather
than
buy
that
peac
of

in
my
opinion
get

enough
in
my
case
that
be

i
could
do
myself
i
just
didnt
want
to
mess
with

and
such
youd
be
surpris
how

a
ripoff
plu
i
think
the
extra
year
of
hour
roadsid

must
be
worth
so
mete
i
opt
for
the

plan
for
extra
yr
