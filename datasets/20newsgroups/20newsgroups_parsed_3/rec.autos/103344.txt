camri
eat
clutch
master
cyl
i
have
both
an
and
an
camri
each
with
manual
speed
transmiss
the
ha
about
mile
on
it
and
the
about
mile
about
a
year
ago
i
found
that
the
master
cylind
on
the
clutch
in
the
wa
leak
fluid
around
the
piston
seal
lead
to
air
in
the
system
and
fluid
back
into
the
passeng
compart
of
the
car
i
pull
the
plunger
and
got
a
rebuild
kit
new
plunger
seal
etc
and
thought
i
had
the
problem
lick
much
to
my
surpris
the
same
problem
develop
sever
month
later
thi
time
i
look
care
at
the
master
cylind
to
make
sure
there
were
no
scratch
burr
or
other
obviou
caus
of
the
problem
i
didnt
find
ani
ever
sinc
i
have
been
period
feed
the
clutch
hydraulin
addit
fluid
and
bleed
air
from
the
system
i
knew
i
would
be
sell
the
car
and
didnt
want
to
go
all
the
way
to
solv
the
problem
i
should
add
that
the
clutch
is
origin
and
that
ive
had
to
adjust
the
pedal
to
allow
maximum
extens
of
the
piston
into
the
master
cylind
in
order
to
actuat
the
clutch
my
hypothesi
is
that
thi
mean
that
when
fulli
depress
the
clutch
pedal
the
angl
of
the
piston
rod
attach
to
the
pedal
is
off
the
axix
of
the
cylind
thu
cock
the
piston
and
seal
and
perhap
deform
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
a
an
explan
can
you
suggest
a
possibl
fix
short
of
replac
the
master
cylind
and
get
a
new
clutch
put
in
now
the
same
problem
except
that
the
abov
diagnosi
doesnt
explain
whi
all
of
the
fluid
leak
out
by
way
of
the
master
cylind
into
the
passeng
compart
while
i
wa
on
vacat
for
day
dure
which
the
clutch
pedal
wa
not
depress
or
otherwis
caus
to
distort
what
can
you
suggest
here
mani
thank
let
hope
i
dont
end
up
go
to
click
and
clack
