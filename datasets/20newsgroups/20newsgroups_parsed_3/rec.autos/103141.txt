re
best
radar
detector
valentin
ive
had
a
valentin
for
about
month
now
and
i
agre
that
it
is
the
best
det
ector
avail
the
point
here
is
trust
and
reliabl
ive
been
abl
to
tr
ust
the
valentin
more
than
ani
other
detector
ive
owend
if
the
valentin
sa
y
that
there
is
a
moder
to
strong
radar
sourc
in
front
of
me
then
it
mo
re
than
like
to
be
a
speed
trap
with
my
other
detector
ive
gotten
so
mani
fals
that
ive
begun
to
ignor
someo
of
the
warn
becaus
i
didnt
want
t
o
drive
like
i
had
one
foot
on
the
brake
and
one
on
the
ga
pedal
that
direct
indic
realli
realli
help
plu
more
info
is
almost
alwa
y
better
than
le
info
no
matter
how
smart
radar
detector
get
the
human
br
ain
is
usual
smarter
so
if
im
go
to
make
a
decisio
base
on
inform
at
hand
i
want
all
the
info
i
can
get
plu
if
you
divid
the
overal
streng
th
of
the
radar
signal
by
the
number
of
bogey
report
youll
find
that
each
bogey
is
pretti
weak
and
therefor
not
a
radar
threat
with
other
detector
yo
ull
just
get
one
strong
warn
my
logic
may
be
faulti
on
thi
but
i
think
i
t
work
okay
although
i
must
admit
that
i
havent
realli
notic
the
reflect
problem
of
one
radar
souc
thoma
