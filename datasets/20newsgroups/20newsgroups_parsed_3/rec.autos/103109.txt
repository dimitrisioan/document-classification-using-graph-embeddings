is
beyond
me
if
you
cant
handl
a
stick
you
should
stick
with
a
regular
tauru
and
leav
the
sho
to
real
driver
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
arent
real
driver
who
cant
use
the
stick
eg
disabl
person
but
they
arent
in
ani
posit
to
use
an
sho
anyway
i
would
be
will
to
bet
that
if
we
remov
the
automat
transmiss
from
all
performancetyp
car
like
the
l
mustang
camaro
and
the
like
wed
cut

fine
for

but
they
have
no
busi

reknown
for
their
long
life
and
abil
to
handl
copiou
amount
of
power
i
live
in
the
dalla
area
and
a
manual
would
be
much
harder
to
drive
in
the
traffic
here
now
if
i
still
live
out
in
the
stick
like
i
use
to
a
manual
would
be
more
fun
safetywis
an

is
le
distractingi
would
hate
to
have
to
be
shift
gear
while
i
wa
tri
to
ea
into
traffic
in
the
freeway
here
performancewis
i
can
hold
my
own
against
ani
stock
mustang
or
camaro
w
a
