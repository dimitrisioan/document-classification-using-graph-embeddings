too
fast
in
a
previou
articl
gari
w
mahan
say
whi
should
a
good
driver
be
terrifi
at
mph
the
onli
thing
i
fear
go
at
are
driver
who
switch
to
the
left
lane
without
use
either
rearviewmirror
or
flasher
do
to
aint
a
rush
for
me
but
it
fun
and
i
get
where
i
want
to
go
much
faster
in
defens
of
the
driver
who
are
in
the
right
lane
here
in
the
state
peopl
simpli
do
not
expect
when
they
are
drive
to
be
overtaken
at
a
speed
differenti
of
mph
i
dont
think
thi
is
becaus
they
are
stupid
of
cours
there
are
except
they
are
just
program
becaus
of
the
mph
limit
do
you
in
the
state
when
you
look
in
the
rearview
alway
calcul
futur
posit
of
car
base
on
a
speed
differenti
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
to
drive
in
the
left
lane
fast
but
when
i
overtak
car
who
are
on
the
right
i
slow
down
a
tad
bit
if
i
were
to
reli
on
the
judgement
of
the
other
car
to
recogn
the
speed
differenti
i
would
be
the
stupid
one
just
to
satiat
my
curios
whi
would
thi
make
you
the
stupid
one
it
seem
to
me
everybodi
should
be
awar
enough
of
what
is
go
on
you
do
not
need
to
calcul
the
futur
posit
you
need
to
look
at
your
mirror
a
littl
more
if
you
glanc
around
you
will
be
abl
to
tell
how
much
faster
than
you
the
car
is
go
mayb
not
precis
but
well
enough
to
know
if
you
should
let
him
around
befor
you
tri
to
pa
i
know
what
you
are
talk
about
about
the
other
driver
be
startl
becaus
i
myself
have
been
startl
by
driver
cruis
by
at
around
mph
when
im
doin
the
problem
though
a
i
saw
it
wa
not
their
fault
for
barrel
around
me
but
my
fault
for
not
pay
the
attent
to
my
taskathand
that
i
should
have
been
oddli
enough
sinc
the
nd
timehappen
x
in
around
mo
when
id
had
my
liscenc
for
around
mo
i
havent
been
startledand
ive
been
pass
by
car
do
roughli
twice
the
speed
of
my
car
anoth
odd
occur
is
the
fact
that
thi
onli
seem
to
happen
on
long
tripsand
if
i
drive
along
with
them
it
doesnt
happen
at
all
even
on
the
long
trip
adrenalin
will
do
that
to
youiv
had
bad
cop
experi
with
speed
so
anyth
over
the
limit
is
adren
for
mescar
ill
get
caught
mayb
they
should
rais
the
limit
so
we
can
pay
better
attent
just
curiou
