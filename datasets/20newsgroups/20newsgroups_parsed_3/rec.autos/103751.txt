a
mention
befor
idl
is
a
bit
bounci
go
from
rpm
to
rpm
wiper
are
slow
that
teh
gripe
the
owner
say
that
he
chang
radiat
altern
rotor
and
calip
exhaust
the
biggest
problem
is
that
the
owner
is
a
shifti
sob
tell
strang
stori
i
hate
that
i
would
never
buy
from
a
persom
like
that
except
how
often
you
see
a
descent
i
for
that
amount
of
money
he
also
said
that
although
i
could
bring
a
mechanicin
he
wouldnt
let
me
check
the
car
by
take
it
to
a
garag
suspici
and
who
know
what
milag
is
on
it
so
let
me
know
what
to
check
for
given
there
practic
no
rust
i
know
there
wa
an
articl
on
i
in
rd
a
few
year
back
anybodi
rememb
what
issu
mike
dont
buy
it
all
of
the
thing
you
mention
will
just
give
you
headach
later
on
also
it
sound
like
the
car
need
a
lot
of
work
and
a
you
probabl
know
bmw
are
not
cheap
to
fix
either
the
owner
sound
like
a
shadi
charact
just
tri
to
take
advantag
of
someon
sure
sound
good
but
you
should
calcul
how
much
the
repair
will
be
it
sound
like
you
would
have
to
sink
in
at
least
to
get
everyth
fix
if
not
more
also
never
trust
anyon
a
far
a
mileag
is
concern
who
know
how
mani
mile
are
on
it
and
how
it
wa
driven
sure
peopl
tell
you
bmw
hold
up
but
you
have
to
consid
ani
car
is
subject
to
wear
and
tear
for
all
you
know
it
could
have
mile
on
it
the
thing
you
have
to
rememb
is
that
thi
isnt
the
last
i
around
either
just
wait
and
keep
shop
for
around
you
can
probabl
find
one
that
is
better
need
le
repair
and
ha
legitim
mileag
unlik
the
one
you
are
consid
take
it
from
a
guy
who
ha
been
taken
a
coupl
of
time
good
luck
al
himsl
