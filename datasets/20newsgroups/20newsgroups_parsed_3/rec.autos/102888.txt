write
stuff
about
autobahn
and
safeti
of
sho
at
speed
delet
the
mustang
is
essenti
the
same
deal
a
the
sho
a
big
power
the
mustang
is
a
much
wors
case
of
design
irrespons
than
the
sho
plant
stuck
in
a
midsiz
sedan
with
almost
no
other
modif
i
have
reallif
experi
with
the
mustang
it
handl
like
a
brick
except
when
your
invok
overst
of
cours
someth
i
it
hard
to
predicatbali
drift
a
stock
mustang
becaus
of
the
suspens
person
avoid
do
on
the
highway
and
stop
power
is
inadequ
even
from
mph
lot
of
acceller
but
the
rest
of
the
car
is
not
up
to
par
ye
when
i
think
mustang
i
think
schoolbu
f
motor
in
my
mind
the
mustang
should
be
fit
with
a
speed
limit
at
or
so
it
just
isnt
safe
check
out
your
local
junkyard
mustang
outnumb
other
car
by
a
proport
way
in
excess
of
sale
in
junkyard
i
find
it
astonish
the
cu
or
somesuchlik
ha
not
jump
on
the
mustang
for
poor
brake
in
relat
to
power
ford
should
at
least
standard
on
the
svo
rear
brake
for
all
s
i
pick
the
porsch
exampl
becaus
they
are
design
with
speed
in
mind
it
didnt
have
to
be
the
it
could
have
been
the
much
cheaper
or
one
of
sever
merced
or
audi
model
all
of
these
car
are
fairli
expens
but
so
are
the
part
that
make
them
drivabl
at
high
speed
thi
should
be
elementari
there
are
a
few
thing
to
keep
in
mind
about
europ
sinc
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledg
is
admittedli
secondhand
but
i
believ
the
follow
to
be
true
driver
are
much
better
disciplin
in
europ
than
they
are
here
true
of
northern
europ
latin
countri
are
someth
els
the
road
compris
the
autobahn
are
much
better
design
than
kindof
true
rememb
they
were
build
by
adolf
in
the
s
they
are
here
and
usual
includ
anim
fenc
thi
make
them
far
more
predict
than
most
u
highway
ye
not
all
of
europ
is
the
autobahn
most
place
in
europ
have
autobahn
is
the
german
word
for
freeway
other
countri
have
differ
name
for
loos
equival
autostrada
autorout
motorway
etc
speed
limit
that
arent
outoflin
with
what
we
use
to
have
in
the
u
if
my
friend
werent
lie
to
me
theyr
typic
not
much
higher
than
kmh
europ
did
seem
on
the
brink
of
a
kmh
limit
it
hasnt
pass
a
far
a
i
know
typic
speed
in
western
europ
are
much
higher
than
the
u
law
enforc
is
neglig
in
my
experi
comapr
to
the
u
a
there
is
no
revenu
enhanc
motiv
the
thing
you
realli
notic
are
the
higher
speed
differenti
and
the
more
profession
attitud
to
drive
you
just
never
see
two
car
run
parallel
at
mph
oblivi
to
all
around
them
i
strongli
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owner
do
mph
nearli
kmh
on
the
autobahn
but
i
could
be
wrong
some
peopl
your
wrong
gti
go
thi
fast
just
kind
of
noisi
not
the
ideal
autobahn
car
a
lot
of
time
you
see
car
be
driven
with
the
driver
foot
on
the
floor
how
do
i
know
when
your
not
make
ani
ground
on
the
ident
car
in
front
of
you
have
no
respect
for
their
own
life
if
someth
happen
at
your
dead
but
the
same
go
for
much
over
drive
at
high
speed
forc
you
to
concentr
i
feel
much
safer
drive
on
the
autobahn
than
in
typic
u
traffic
becaus
most
peopl
seem
to
be
awak
ive
never
seen
ani
driver
read
a
book
on
an
autobahn
i
see
it
all
too
often
in
the
u
craig
it
just
doesnt
seem
fast
after
minut
or
so
of
aclim
everybodi

that
fast
no
big
