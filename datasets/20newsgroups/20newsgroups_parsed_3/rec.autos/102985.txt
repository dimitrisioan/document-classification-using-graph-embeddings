i
am
current
in
the
car
market
and
would
like
opinion
on
a
vw
passat
glx
how
doe
it
compar
to
a
toyota
camri
i
thought
the
car
look
veri
solid
stabl
and
european
onli
disappoint
so
far
is
that
that
it
doesnt
offer
an
airbao
my
next
question
is
whi
isnt
vw
offer
automobil
with
airbag
should
i
pay
the
extra
three
thousand
for
a
bmw
is
even
though
it
is
smaller
and
le
power
than
than
the
passat
i
think
vw
got
caught
out
on
the
airbag
thing
it
onli
been
in
the
last
year
or
two
that
airbag
have
becom
a
signific
sell
featur
vw
assum
that
automat
belt
would
satisfi
govt
requir
for
passiv
restraint
but
didnt
guess
that
the
merican
consum
would
actual
make
buy
decis
base
on
the
presenc
of
an
airbag
vw
is
realli
hurt
right
now
in
the
u
market
check
out
the
articl
in
last
week
autoweek
about
the
crisi
at
vw
golf
and
jetta
will
be
come
from
the
plant
in
mexico
but
they
dont
have
the
qualiti
at
that
facil
a
per
normal
vw
practic
the
u
launch
of
the
jetta
iii
is
delay
again
and
again
until
a
good
chunk
of
the
use
life
of
the
design
is
spent
i
think
that
passat
come
from
germani
so
there
is
not
the
same
qualiti
and
avail
issu
it
a
nice
car
with
a
nice

whether
vw
will
be
