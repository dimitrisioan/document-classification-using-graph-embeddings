could
someon
explain
how
to
make
sens
of
drag
coeffici
ie
cd
mention
in
magazin
i
understand
that
lower
number
signifi
better
aerodynam
but
what
doe
thi
mean
in
the
real
world
is
there
a
way
to
calcul
new
top
speedsassum
the
car
is
not
rev
limit
at
top
speed
or
mileag
benefit
if
a
ident
car
had
the
cd
reduc
from
to
i
dont
rememb
the
formula
off
hand
a
it
ha
been
awhil
sinc
i
took
aerodynam
and
havent
use
the
stuff
sinc
the
cd
is
relat
to
the
drag
forc
which
is
what
effect
top
speed
and
fuel
consumpt
when
the
drag
forc
on
the
car
or
aircraft
is
greater
than
what
the
vehicl
engin
can
overcom
it
ha
reach
it
top
speed
auto
of
cours
also
have
to
overcom
roll
resist
sinc
drag
oppos
the
vehicl
motion
the
engin
must
make
up
for
that
by
burn
more
fuel
anyway
sinc
the
geometeri
of
an
auto
is
rather
complex
the
dragpressur
coeffiecentetc
is
either
found
experimentali
or
use
a
numer
method
anyway
for
flow
around
a

the
drag

is
cd
dqr
where
d
is
the

forc
q
the

r
is
the

you
can
set
