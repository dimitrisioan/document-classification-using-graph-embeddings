wagon
which
i
have
heard
is
somehow
slightli
faster
than
the
coup
wagon
ha
an
automat
it
slower
could
be
due
to
the
rearend
ratio
also
usual
automat
have
differ
rearend
than
manual
from
my
limit
experi
anyway
youll
have
fun
look
for
the
rearend
gear
on
an
shoth
tauru
is
a
frontwheeldr
vehicl
i
went
back
and
check
the
articl
again
the
sho
wagon
is
quicker
than
the
sho
automat
but
significantli
slower
than
the
real
sho
whi
anyon
would
order
an
sho
with
an
automat
transmiss
is
beyond
me
if
you
cant
handl
a
stick
you
should
stick
with
a
regular
tauru
and
leav
the
sho
to
real
driver
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
arent
real
driver
who
cant
use
the
stick
eg
disabl
person
but
they
arent
in
ani
posit
to
use
an
sho
anyway
i
would
be
will
to
bet
that
if
we
remov
the
automat
transmiss
from
all
performancetyp
car
like
the
l
mustang
camaro
and
the
like
wed
