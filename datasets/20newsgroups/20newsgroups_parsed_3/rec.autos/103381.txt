the
big
disadvantag
of
automat
is
the
hp
they
consum
that
never
get
to
the
wheel
in
thi
respect
they
are
at
a
disadvantag
to
a
manual
onli
when
the
torqu

i
say
that
a
smart
automat
is
better
than
the
major
of
driver
in
term
of
be
in
the
right
gear
at
the
right
time
which
to
me
is
more
import
than
torqu
convert
loss
i
prefer
the
stick
for
fun
and
the
auto
for
traffic
