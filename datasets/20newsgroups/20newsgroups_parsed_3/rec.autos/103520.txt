wrote
base
on
my
experi
with
a
fj
the
hardtop
jeepstyl
model
i
would
definit
give
a
new
model
consider
if
i
were
in
the
market
the
older
model
are
veri
well
built
unless
toyota
lost
it
mind
i
would
assum
until
proven
otherwis
that
the
newer
model
have
inherit
some
if
not
all
of
the
qualiti
of
their
ancestor
two
major
differ
in
the
run
gear
that
im
awar
of
need
studi
my
ha
a
solid
front
axl
hous
wherea
the
newer
model
have
independ
front
suspens
the
solid
axl
is
theoret
stronger
and
the
new
cruiser
do
not
have
independ
suspens
in
the
front
they
still
run
a
straight
axl
but
with
coil
the
runner
is
the
one
with
independ
front
the
cruiser
have
incred
wheel
travel
with
thi
system
more
reliabl
than
the
newer
model
but
onli
experi
will
tell
the
independ
front
suspens
is
no
doubt
a
compromis
made
to
satisfi
the
typic
user
who
will
never
need
a
real
util
vehicl
the
second
differ
is
the
type
of
transfer
case
use
on
the
newer
model
im
not
sure
but
i
think
tioyota
went
to
a
fulltim
wd
or
allwheel
drive
system
the
older
landcruis
have
a
lockup
type
both
have
their
advantag
and
disadvantag
the
up
cruiser
doe
have
full
time
wd
but
the
center
diff
lock
in
low
rang
my
brother
ha
a
and
is
an
incred
sturdi
vehicl
which
ha
done
all
the
trail
in
moab
without
a
tow
the
and
later
is
even
better
with
the
bigger
engin
and
lock
