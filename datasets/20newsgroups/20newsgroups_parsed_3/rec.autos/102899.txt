i
recal
statist
show
that
woman
tend
to
have
more
accid

men
but
the
damag

fewer
but
far
more
expens
accid
the
rate
of
total
vehicl
destruct
wa
significantli
higher
for
men
than
woman
particularli
in
the
younger
male
age
group
imho
social
consider
are
probabl
the
strongest
influenc
here
possibl
more
so
than
ani
differ
between
the
sex
social
influenc
often
affect
the
type
of
car
that
bought
and
the
situat
the
car
is
use
in
and
the
type
of
car
and
drive
situat
have
a
major
effect
on
accid
risk
thu
if
societi
expect
you

unusu
i
can
usual
figur
out
if
it
is
a
male

may
give
a
person
more
reason
to
