ani
opinion
of

ala
how
they
do
in

long
run

ive
found
mine
probe
gt
to
do
quit
well
window
problem
delet
artic
ha
been
trim
i
have
had
my
probe
look
at
twice
by
my
local
dealer
where
i
purchas
the
car
the
first
time
they
made
thi
problem
wors
the
second
time
after
advis
them
of
the
servic
bulletin
mention
on
my
fordprob
mail
list
they
said
they
didnt
know
of
the
bulletin
they
adjust
the
window
and
made
it
much
better
howev
it
now
make
a
scritch
scritch
nois
on
rough
road
and
still
squeal
when
i
openclos
the
window
in
wet
weather
anyon
el
do
thi
ive
not
had
ani
of
the
air
or
leakag
problem
that
have
been
report
but
do
get
the
squeal
that
bill
describ
i
live
in
seattl
so
the
wet
weather
may
be
a
factor

are
terribl
thi
is
true
im
wonder
if
thi
may
be
a
safeti
concern
ie
if
peopl
pound
on
the
place
where
the
airbag
live
speak
of
the
horn
i
wa
surpris
to
find
that
the
probe
come
with
one
of
those
nice
merican
sound
horn
instead
of
the
japanes
sound
kind
the
previou
probe
had
japanes
horn
no
opinion
transmiss
the
speed
is
a
must
i
have
alway
been
a
speed
guy
almost
everi
car
ive
ever
own
ha
been
a
speed
becaus
i
got
a
good
deal
on
thi
car
with
the
mile
i
knowingli
overlook
the
fact
that
it
ha
an
automat
but
it
is
a
pretti
hightech
automat
it
is
a
fulli
electronicali
control
speed
with
the
speed
is
much
more
fun
we
opt
for
the
automat
for
a
number
of
reason
but
it
still
fun
and
in
some
way
more
practic
no
shakerattl
nois
when
go
over
bumpspothol
still
ditto
shake
and
rattl
ha
been
my
main
gripe
ive
gotten
them
to
fix
the
worst
of
them
but
i
fear
that
with
the
rather
harsh
ride
the
car
will
be
a
virtual
potpouri
of
rattl
when
it
get
older
i
too
would
suspect
that
thi
may
be
true

definit
fordmazda
did
a
veri
veri
nice
job
on
thi
one
the
car
ha
a
much
more
expens
than
it
actual
is
look
and
feel
to
it
ditto
ye
thi
car
stiff
suspens
isnt
for
everyon
i
person
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
littl
harsh
but
otherwis
like
the
car
id
strongli
suggest
look
into
the
mx
agre
check
it
out
i
dont
mind
it
but
would
say
that
if
it
wa
much
stiffer
it
might
be
a
problem
how
about
the
r
rx
for
suspens
well
i
wouldnt
encourag
passengercarri
in
the
probe
unless
the
person
in
the
front
seat
like
to
sit
with
hi
knee
to
the
dash
a
mention
in
the
consum
report
writeup
consid
the
back
seat
a
a
parcel
shelf
no
biggi
to
me
though
if
it
had
been
id
not
have
bought
the
car
but
it
definit
not
a
famili
car
true
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
ha
troubl
but
mine
work
fine
i
havent
heard
about
thi
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
veri
earli
probe
and
mayb
had
problem
with
prematur
rust
muffler
which
ive
had
thi
problem
and
read
about
it
or
at
least
i
assum
the
one
i
had
wa
the
one
i
read
about
in
ani
case
what
happen
wa
the
weld
between
the
muffler
and
the
pipe
feed
it
ok
so
im
not
a
mechan
broke
in
my
case
the
dealer
weld
it
order
replac
part
and
put
them
on
when
they
got
them
i
suspect
thi
is
some
sort
of
design
flaw
or
product
flaw
in
ani
case
i
have
an
earlier
model
and
would
expect
it
to
be
work
out
on
newer
one
in
ani
case
it
is
a
warrante
repair
or
they
get
the
key
back
from
what
ive
heard
it
sound
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problem
with
the
probe
and
probabl
mx
when
they
first
went
into
product
but
i
think
these
problem
have
mostli
been
correct
at
thi
point
that
almost
alway
to
be
expect
with
a
complet
new
car
like
thi
though
i
have
to
agre
that
they
seem
to
have
some
qc
problesm
but
i
serious
feel
the
car
design
is
sound
and
expect
it
to
do
veri
well
i
second
thi
there
seem
to
be
some
thing
that
slip
through
but
the
car
seem
veri
sound
while
not
perfect
