from

in

i
came
back
to
that
dealer
in
two
week
to
sign
a
purchas
agreement
then
i
wa
told
that
the
salesperson
made
an
error
in
price
i
walk
out
of
that
dealer
i
wonder
if
thi
kind
of
practic
is
common
with
toyota
dealer
is
the
price

i
would
appric
ani
comment
i
had
a
similar
experi
we
had
a
written

which
had
been
mail
to
u
from
the
salesman
at
one
of
these
nohaggl
toyota

for

xle
wab
leather
etc
the
price
seem
fair
but
when
we
went
in
to
take
them
up
on
their
offer
they
discov
that
certain
extra
cost
item
hadnt
been
includ
in
their
origin
written
quot
it
would
have
total
an
extra
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
had
a
written
quot
they
said
there
wa
noth
they
could
do
bottom

from
salemen
are
worthless
and
it
appear
to
me
that
the
toyota
dealer
think
theyv
got
such
a
superior
auto
that
they
dont
have
to
deal
we
walk
went
out
