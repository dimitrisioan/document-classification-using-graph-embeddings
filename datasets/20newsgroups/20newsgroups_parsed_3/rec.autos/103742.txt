let
me
explain
whi
i
feel
the
bogey
counter
featur
is
a
gimmick
radar
wave
bounc
off
object
especi
metal
that
is
how
radar
speed
measur
work
a
high
frequenc
microwav
x
band
approx
ghz
and
k
is
approx
ghz
is
sent
out
and
reflect
back
to
the
antenna
off
of
an
automobil
or
other
object
if
an
object
is
move
a
doppler
shift
about
hz
per
mph
on
x
band
occur
is
measur
and
convert
to
mile
per
hour
these
wave
bounc
all
over
the
place
and
they
can
reflect
mani
time
and
go
in
mani
direct
from
what
i
understand
the
valentin
can
onli
tell
if
these
microwav
are
come
from
the
front
rear
or
both
there
are
onli
two
antenna
if
they
are
come
from
both
thi
in
interpret
a
a
side
bogey
bogey
count
are
determin
a
sourc
by
their
rel
strength
to
one
anoth
even
if
they
are
reflect
of
the
same
sourc
im
certainli
no
engin
and
realli
have
no
scientif
basi
on
which
to
make
thi
argument
but
dont
you
answer
your
own
question
is
the
reflect
signal
shift
at
all
from
the
act
of
be
reflect
if
so
wouldnt
it
then
be
easi
for
the
detector
to
discrimin
between
reflect
and
direct
sourc
here
is
the
problem
sinc
the
microwav
reflect
how
doe
the
unit
tell
if
it
is
a
sourc
or
a
reflect
take
a
valentin
and
drive
to
the
local
groceri
store
that
us
an
xband
radar
door
open
you
can
tell
by
the
small
black
box
abov
the
door
point
down
at
about
a
degre
angl
and
your
detector
go
off
when
it
get
near
the
valentin
will
count
or
bogey
from
all
direct
front
rear
and
side
it
doesnt
say
which
side
the
count
chang
a
car
drive
by
and
reflect
chang
is
there
or
sourc
not
at
the
store
i
go
to
a
i
drive
around
with
a
standard
detector
i
can
onli
find
one
sourc
and
that
is
the
door
open
for
the
front
door
