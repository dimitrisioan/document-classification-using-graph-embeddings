hei
nz
write
after
too
mani
year
of
school
im
final
graduat
and
get
a
real
job
of
cours
i
am
tri
to
make
plan
of
how
to
spend
all
thi
extra
money
right
now
i
have
an
accord
a
good
car
but
not
real
sporti
i
wa
think
of
sell
it
in
about
two
year
and
drop
around
k
on
a
sport
car
of
some
kind
after
think
about
it
i
may
have
a
better
idea
ill
keep
the
accord
until
it
drop
and
buy
the
car
ive
alway
want
a
corvett
stingray
my
reason
is
that
accord
corvett
is
le
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basic
im
think
of
a
late
s
earli
s
for
around
k
my
question
is
what
are
good
year
to
consid
for
reliabl
look
horsepow
in
that
order
believ
it
or
not
horsepow
is
not
a
main
concern
if
i
want
to
go
fast
i
get
on
my
motorcycl
and
what
are
good
price
also
what
would
insur
look
like
im
male
singl
i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the
car
lower
insur
would
the
fact
that
i
mainli
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rare
driven
insur
class
for
drive
it
under
k
mile
per
year
my
dad
ha
a
vett
and
it
on
what
you
say
classic
insur
basic
what
that
mean
is
that
it
ha
restrict
amount
of
drive
time
which
basic
mean
it
cant
be
use
a
an
everi
day
car
and
would
probabl
suit
your
need
for
limit
mileag
in
my
area
denver
if
you
look
around
alittl
you
can
get
an
for
or
le
not
much
le
you
said
your
not
look
to
go
fast
they
are
a
realli
nice
car
just
not
real
power
in
addit
to
restrict
mileag
mani
classic
insur
carrier
also
requir
that
the
vehicl
be
garag
when
not
in
use
