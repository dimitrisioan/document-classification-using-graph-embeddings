did
u
drive
on
the
left
the
reason
i
ask
is
becaus
i
went
to
a
classic
car
meet
here
in
the
uk
and
saw
a
veri
nice
old
de
soto
s
vintag
id
guess
with
wooden
artilleri
type
wheel
etc
but
it
wa
righthand
drive
i
cant
believ
that
desoto
produc
rhd
car
just
for
the
uk
well
sweden
and
australia
and
lord
know
wherev
els
use
to
drive
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
so
the
export
market
might
have
been
larger
then
than
just
the
uk
im
guess
but
i
believ
in
the
twenti
we
probabl
drove
mostli
down
cattl
trail
and
in

rut
i
am
fairli

that
