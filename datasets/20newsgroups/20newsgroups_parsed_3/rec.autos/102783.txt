a
wouldb
passer
i
would
not
block
a
wouldb
passer
for
their
own
good
or
for
ani
reason
other
than
i
wa
prevent
from
do
so
due
to
the
traffic
circumst
i
fail
to
see
how
deter
a
passer
under
these
circumst
would
in
ani
way
decreas
your
chanc
of
be
involv
in
an
accid
fatal
or

i
could
imagin
how
block
a
wouldb
passer
would
actual
increas
your
chanc
of
be
of
or
involv
in
an
accid
especi
if
thi
passer
is
ride
your
bumper
intent
block
a
person
ride
your
bumper
is
certainli
not
a
wise
drive
practic
it
onli
caus
the
jam
to
becom
more
congest
i
dont
mess
with
truck
and
i
actual
watch
the
road
ahead
and
the
road
behind
if
i
perceiv
that
i
am
rapidli
close
on
a
pack
of
vehicl
i
tri
to
avoid
get
caught
up
in
situat
such
a
you
decrib
usual
either
traffic
is
just
build
and
i
have
to
deal
with
thi
fact
of
life
or
i
wait
to
a
slow
passer
to
complet
their
pas
and
make
way
for
the
pack
to
clear
if
someon
decid
then
to
pull
up
on
my
bumper
i
signal
my
intent
to
move
to
the
right
and
do
so
at
the
first
opportun
hope
they
will
open
the
jam
i
feel
thi
is
not
onli
courteou
drive
but
alot
safer
than
the
action
you
advoc
there
are
actual
mani
courteou
driver
on
the
road
who
do
not
intent
imped
other
if
someon
in
front
of
me
seem
to
be
oblivi
to
the
fact
that
they
are
block
traffic
i
use
my
blinker
or
flash
my
light
or
if
all
el
fail
will
briefli
speed
up
slow
down
so
they
might
get
the
messag
that
i
am
a
faster
vehicl
tri
to
pas
i
feel
it
is
never
safe
to
ride
anyon
bumper
if
someon
is
intent
block
traffic
becaus
they
feel
that
it
is
civil
duti
or
philosoph
duti
or
for
some
unfathom
reason
i
feel
they
deserv
at
the
veri
least
deris
sorri
thi
is
soooooooo
long
