their
core
competit
is
the
civic
corolla
and
sentra
most
of
the
other
model
are
in
the
same
class
but
arent
the
first
car
you
would
think
of
i
threw
in
the
escorttrac
becaus
it
ha
a
good
amount
of
japanes

i
didnt
includ
domest
small
car
such
a
the

i
think
saturn
is
go
after
car
that
have
at
least
some
degre

if
you
look
at
the
price
of
these
car
theyr
more
expens
than
theyr
door
counterpart
the
is
good
reason
for
thi
it
is
a
more
upscal
and
trenddriven
market
even
though
mani
of
these
model
are
base
on
sedan
platform
their
interior
etc
is
good
enough
to
warrant
slightli
higher
price
here
are
some
of
the
platform
deriv
i
can
think
of
tercel

not
sure
on
thi
one
stylu
impulsestorm
to
illustr
a
tercel
start
at
around
while
the
paseo
start
at
around
even
a
door
tercel
will
cost
le
than
a
door
paseo
now
you
might
be
say
that
the
tercel
doesnt
offer
the
power
that
some
door
offer
what
i
mean
is
that
there
is
no
dr
tercel
with
a
compar
powerpl
a
it
sport

deriv
let
take
anoth
exampl
the
isuzu

x
and
impuls
xsstorm
gsi
both
have
the
same
powerpl
a
l
hp
engin
but
the
smaller
dr
coup
are
gener
more
expens
again
thi
is
becaus
the
twodoor
sport
coup
market
is
a
more
fashionori
and
trendset
segment
peopl
are
will
to
pay
more
money
for
thi
type
of
car
in

even

the
