thi
happen
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nose
drunken
kid
decid
it
would
be
realli
cool
to
throw
huge
rock
down
on
car
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
car
were
hit
there
were
sever
seriou
injuri
and
sadli
a
small
girl
sit
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
wa
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rock
i
dont
recal
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
wa
comatos
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctor
werent
hold
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happen
to
thi
great
countri
of
our
i
can
see
boyhood
prank
of
pee
off
of
bridg
and
such
but
pound
rock
ha
our
societi
realli
stoop
thi
low
ye
nobodi
is
watch
them
if
they
get
caught
there
is
no
punish
at
all
in
the
old
day
such
behaviour
would
be
reward
with
a
whip
with
a
goodsiz
belt
and
then
taken
into
some
hospit
to
see
first
hand
what
kind
of
damag
such
accid
caus
of
cours
thi
doesnt
happen
ani
more
that
whip
would
probabl
save
the
kid
life
by
teach
him
some
respect
for
other
a
person
with
that
littl
respect
would
inevit
wind
up
dead
earli
anyway
the
problem
is
creep
gradual
if
you
put
a
frog
into
hot
water
he
just
jump
out
but
if
you
put
him
into
cold
water
and
then
everso
gradual
heat
it
the
frog
will
cook
thi
is
what
the
entertain
industri
and
lack
of
religi
moral
and
educ
standard
in
our
modern
north
american
societi
have
done
to
u
over
the
year
now
that
we
are
about
to
be
cook
we
may
have
woken
up
too
late
erik
velapold
societi
a
we
have
known
it
it
come
apart
at
the
seam
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
ha
been
devalu
to
the
point
were
kill
someon
is
no
big
deal
kid
see
hundr
on
murder
act
on
tv
we
can
abort
child
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
whi
be
surpris
when
some
kid
drop
lb
rock
and
kill
peopl
they
dont
care
becaus
the
messag
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
and
the
educ
system
and
the
religi
leader
arent
do
much
about
it
either
with
both
parent
work
in
thi
societi
where
is
the
stabil
influenc
at
home
latchkey
child
are
everywher
and
these
latchkey
kid
can
watch
whatev
rotten
video
and
listen
to
whatev
violent
hatepromot
music
and
video
they
like
becaus
no
one
is
home
to
stop
it
thi
day
and
age
when
there
is
about
time
more
thing
to
learn
than
when
i
went
to
school
our
answer
to
thi
increas
knowledg
is
shorter
school
hour
and
more
leisur
time
i
say
keep
the
kid
in
school
longer
feed
them
good
food
and
teach
them
someth
and
when
they
get
home
have
a
parent
there
to
interact
and
monitor
them
there
is
a
veri
old
and
now
forgotten
proverb
a
child
left
on
hi
own
will
bring
a
parent
to
grief
daycar
system
are
not
the
answer
thi
is
just
shift
the
parent
own
respons
off
on
someon
els
to
whom
it
not
a
lifelong
committ
but
rather
just
a
job
