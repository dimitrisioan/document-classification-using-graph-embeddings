brian
j
queiser
write
there
are
two
crank
configur
for
the
flat
the
most
common
one
is
probabl
the
crank
that
is
veri
similar
to
the
i
crank
which
flat
engin
have
i
style
crank
compar
those
two
engin
the
i
and
the
flat
have
no
first
order
shake
forc
or
rock
moment
the
i
ha
a
second
order
shake
forc
while
the
flat
ha
a
second
order
rock
moment
the
signific
thing
about
the
flat
s
second
order
moment
is
that
it
can
be
easili
balanc
out
by
ad
mass
at
the
end
of
the
crank
the
i
howev
requir
a
counter
rotat
shaft
with
mass
to
balanc
out
the
second
order
forc
i
am
sure
that
subaru
and
porsch
use
the
boxer
configur
and
not
the
inlin
crank
that
you
analyz
and
compar
would
you
care
to
reevalu
the
other
case
of
a
flat
four
i
think
that
thi
configur
is
perfectli
balanc
a
far
a
primari
secondari
forc
and
coupl
are
concern
i
have
an
articl
in
front
of
me
that
say
so
bottom
line
the
biggest
differ
between
the
engin
would
probabl
be
their
intend
use
the
flat
is
easier
to
fit
under
low
hood
and
in
rear
compart
for
mid
or
rear
mount
the
i
can
be
mount
transvers
to
reduc
hood
length
read
cab
forward
other
than
that
there
isnt
much
fanfar
to
the
differ
between
them
no
matter
what
subaru
ad
say
technolog
share
with
porsch
inde
the
flat
four
is
also
shorter
than
an
inlin
so
even
if
it
is
mount
longitudin
it
will
not
take
up
lot
of
length
and
a
longitudin
placement
is
easier
for
a
wheel
drive
drivetrain
i
think
that
subaru
ad
hold
water
in
practic
their
flat
four
are
notic
smoother
than
inlin
s
and
complet
buzz
free
though
some
may
not
like
it
peculiar
note
but
a
alfa
ha
shown
a
boxer
four
can
produc
a
spine
tingl
scream
that
onli
the
like
of
recent
honda
can
approach
eliot
