re
too
fast
jim
frost
write
there
are
a
few
thing
to
keep
in
mind
about
europ
sinc
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledg
is
admittedli
secondhand
but
i
believ
the
follow
to
be
true
my
knowledg
about
drive
in
the
u
is
also
secondhand
but
i
think
i
can
correct
your
statement
about
our
autobahn
driver
are
much
better
disciplin
in
europ
than
they
are
here
oh
yeah
that
would
be
paradis
in
fact
you
can
forget
it
from
all
ive
heard
from
my
u
rel
driver
esp
here
in
germani
are
much
more
agg
ressiv
but
not
disciplin
one
of
my
rel
a
la
resid
hire
a
car
at
the
nuernberg
airport
and
went
about
mile
to
our
home
he
said
then
that
he
grew
about
year
older
dure
thi
ride
and
swore
hed
never
drive
a
car
in
germani
again
thi
wa
in
and
he
kept
hi
promis
the
situat
now
is
even
wors
a
effect
of
the
increas
volum
of
traffic
what
you
mean
by
better
disciplin
should
perhap
be
consid
cautiou
due
to
fear
when
drive
around
here
you
alway
have
to
take
into
consider
that
the
major
of
the
other
driver
absolut
reli
on
you
they
expect
that
nobodi
fail
or
sleep
mani
of
them
exploit
thi
by
drive
a
fast
a
their
car
can
go
of
cours
onli
where
that
is
allow
you
might
think
dream
on
so
ani
mistak
you
make
is
a
veri
high
risk
to
your
health
and
if
your
ex
pose
to
such
a
situat
from
your
veri
first
day
a
a
driver
you
learn
to
handl
it
or
you
lose
that
the
way
i
and
most
peopl
i
know
experi
our
traffic
situat
whether
you
think
thi
is
pleasant
or
effici
is
up
to
you
i
think
we
handl
a
veri
high
volum
of
traffic
and
that
at
high
speed
with
modest
compar
to
the
volum
and
decreas
rate
of
lethal
accid
otoh
more
and
more
peopl
esp
woman
dislik
drive
becaus
they
feel
overtax
and
threaten
and
each
accid
is
one
accid
too
much
the
road
compris
the
autobahn
are
much
better
design
than
they
are
here
and
usual
includ
anim
fenc
thi
make
them
far
more
predict
than
most
u
highway
better
design
and
maintain
may
be
but
anim
fenc
are
veri
rare
auto
bahnen
and
mani
other
street
have
guardrail
i
hope
that
the
right
word
a
plank
made
from
thick
steel
sheet
fix
on
upright
it
about
foot
high
those
guardrail
are
design
for
keep
vehicl
on
the
road
smaller
anim
can
crawl
under
the
plank
bigger
one
can
easili
jump
over
it
the
point
is
that
esp
larger
anim
are
veri
rare
in
germani
they
tend
also
to
be
veri
timid
accid
caus
by
anim
are
a
negleg
danger
not
all
of
europ
is
the
autobahn
most
place
in
europ
have
speed
limit
that
arent
outoflin
with
what
we
use
to
have
in
the
u
if
my
friend
werent
lie
to
me
theyr
typic
not
much
higher
than
kmh
your
right
there
are
speed
linit
even
on
the
major
part
of
the
autobahn
but
the
attitud
toward
drive
see
abov
seem
to
be
veri
similar
to
that
in
germani
ive
been
in
franc
switzerland
itali
austria
spain
belgium
the
netherland
besid
that
you
realli
cant
reli
on
the
resid
abid
the
local
speed
limit
ive
got
quit
a
lot
of
practis
k
mile
and
im
use
to
travel
at
mph
fyi
with
a
car
even
smaller
than
a
rabbit
but
i
consid
drive
on
the
highway
round
pari
or
milano
realli
a
thrill
i
strongli
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owner
do
mph
nearli
kmh
on
the
autobahn
but
i
could
be
wrong
sorri
but
youll

even
smaller
mine
is
a

owner
go
that
fast
small

with
much
hp
are
veri

over
here
and
most
peopl
buy
such

arent
afraid
to
let
them
run
some
peopl
have
no

i
disagre
the
size

weight
of
a

is
rather
irrelev
