is
car
saftey
import
i
wa
recent
thumb
through
the
lemonaid
new

guid
what
i
found
wa
a

would
be
given
a
recommend
under
the

while
a
few
sentenc
later
note
how
a
driver
and
passeng
were
virtual
guarante
to
be

in
a
front
end
collis
the
most
highli
recommend

of
all
of
the

not
one
of
the
most

definit
safeti
is
an
import
criterium
for
me
when
buy
a

i
wont
buy
a
small

like
a
civic
or
whatev
great
safeti
handl
speed
for
me
seem
to
me
that
you
would
be
more
dead
in
a
small
car
than
a
larg
car
after
an
accid
gerrit
