mere

can
anyon
offer
ani
opinion
of
the
ford
probe
ala
how
they
do
in
the
long
run
repair
record
reliabl
mileag
etc
some
other
owner
on
the
mail
list
have
comment
about
thi
problem
but
i
havent
seen
it
happen
on
my
month
old
probe
gt
i
think
thi
may
be
someth
that
ford
ha
correct
sinc
the
initi
batch
of
car
also
someon
said
that
ford
ha
issu
a
servic
bulletin
to
inform
dealer
about
how
to
correct
thi
problem
so
you
may
be
abl
to
get
your
dealer
to
fix
it
i
have
had
my
probe
look
at
twice
by
my
local
dealer
where
i
purchas
the
car
the
first
time
they
made
thi
problem
wors
the
second
time
after
advis
them
of
the
servic
bulletin
mention
on
my
fordprob
mail
list
they
said
they
didnt
know
of
the
bulletin
they
adjust
the
window
and
made
it
much
better
howev
it
now
make
a
scritch
scritch
nois
on
rough
road
and
still
squeal
when
i
openclos
the
window
in
wet
weather
anyon
el
do
thi
ford
onli
give
key
with
the
car
cmon
ford
spend
an
extra
few
penni
i
got
two
key
with
my
car
but
onli
one
remoteentri
pushbutton
thingi
but
then
i
bought
my
with
mile
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
a
repossess
so
im
not
surpris
someth
wa
miss
horn
button
behind
air
bag
in
spoke
and
not
in
center
person
prefer
i
am
serious
consid
follow
the
advic
in
the
owner
manual
where
it
describ
the
procedur
to
follow
if
you
discov
someth
on
your
ford
that
could
caus
seriou
injuri
threaten
live
etc
someth
about
notifi
the
nation
traffic
safeti
group
a
well
a
ford
those
littl
youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep
button
are
terribl
the
latter
is
probabl
becaus
of
the
air
bag
it
pretti
much
take
up
all
the
space
where
youd
expect
to
find
the
horn
speak
of
the
horn
i
wa
surpris
to
find
that
the
probe
come
with
one
of
those
nice
merican
sound
horn
instead
of
the
japanes
sound
kind
the
previou
probe
had
japanes
horn
well
i
guess
that
good
in
a
way
but
in
a
way
it
bad
when
someon
hear
that
kind
of
horn
they
expect
to
see
a
big
american
car
they
may
not
associ
the
sound
with
a
small
jap
car
style
car
like
the
probe
is
tire
fling
dirtmud
onto
side
of
car
yeah
not
veri
badli
but
enough
to
be
annoy
sometim
the
mudflap
help
a
lot
transmiss
the
speed
is
a
must
i
have
alway
been
a
speed
guy
almost
everi
car
ive
ever
own
ha
been
a
speed
becaus
i
got
a
good
deal
on
thi
car
with
the
mile
i
knowingli
overlook
the
fact
that
it
ha
an
automat
but
it
is
a
pretti
hightech
automat
it
is
a
fulli
electronicali
control
speed
with
torqu
convert
lockup
even
with
the
automat
im
get
mpg
on
the
highway
drive
but
of
cours
drive
is
illeg
so
i
probabl
made
that
sentenc
up
around
town
the
mileag
ha
been
around
not
bad
for
an
automat
of
cours
it
doesnt
have
the
control
of
a
speed
but
sinc
i
do
a
lot
of
citi
drive
it
turn
out
to
be
veri
conveni
it
nice
to
be
abl
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffe
and
drive
at
the
same
time
although
that
too
is
illeg
here
in
weliketocontrolyourlif
massachusett
no
shakerattl
nois
when
go
over
bumpspothol
still
shake
and
rattl
ha
been
my
main
gripe
ive
gotten
them
to
fix
the
worst
of
them
but
i
fear
that
with
the
rather
harsh
ride
the
car
will
be
a
virtual
potpouri
of
rattl
when
it
get
older
tire
vr
goodyear
eagl
left
hope
for
k
on
my
probe
gl
i
got
about
k
out
of
the
origin
goodyear
and
had
driven
the
replac
tire
bridgeston
k
mile
when
i
trade
the
car
the
vr
fireston
on
my
probe
look
like
theyr
design
for
perform
ie
rather
wide
shallow
tread
etc
so
they
probabl
wont
last
a
long
but
the
car
handl
veri
veri
veri
well
it
stick
to
the
road
like
glue
even
on
a
rough
surfac
interior
is
veri
veri
nice
too
veri
plea
to
the
eye
and
ergonom
sound
definit
fordmazda
did
a
veri
veri
nice
job
on
thi
one
the
car
ha
a
much
more
expens
than
it
actual
is
look
and
feel
to
it
ye
thi
car
stiff
suspens
isnt
for
everyon
i
person
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
littl
harsh
but
otherwis
like
the
car
id
strongli
suggest
look
into
the
mx
have
driven
an
probe
for
year
i
find
the
suspens
interest
the
car
actual
drive
much
better
than
the
it
is
a
veri
firm
ride
and
you
definit
know
about
each
and
everi
bump
in
the
road
yet
the
car
remain
veri
civil
on
even
the
bumpiest
road
you
hear
and
feel
the
bump
yet
the
car
retain
it
postur
veri
well
if
you
have
passeng
by
all
mean
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
ride
differ
if
that
better
is
up
to
you
well
i
wouldnt
encourag
passengercarri
in
the
probe
unless
the
person
in
the
front
seat
like
to
sit
with
hi
knee
to
the
dash
a
mention
in
the
consum
report
writeup
consid
the
back
seat
a
a
parcel
shelf
no
biggi
to
me
though
if
it
had
been
id
not
have
bought
the
car
but
it
definit
not
a
famili
car
also
there
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expect
the
temperatur
insid
the
car
get
pretti
hot
in
the
summer
ac
is
a
must
on
ani
probe
from
the
in
particular
send
out
a
real
blast
of
cool
air
when
the
ac
is
on
max
that
lot
of
glass
you
mention
is
what
give
the
car
the
veri
good
visibl
report
you
see
in
all
the
writeup
most
sportssporti
car
dont
have
that
good
visibl
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
ha
troubl
but
mine
work
fine
i
havent
heard
about
thi
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
veri
earli
probe
and
mayb
had
problem
with
prematur
rust
muffler
which
the
complaint
ive
heard
re
exhaust
system
on
s
have
been
on
the
gt
of
cours
be
a
differ
engin
that
is
a
differ
exhaust
system
i
wa
one
of
those
with
an
who
qualifi
for
the
free
replac
sinc
i
had
alreadi
replac
the
muffler
when
i
receiv
the
notic
i
wasam
due
a
refund
from
ford
i
appli
in
februari
and
am
still
wait
gave
me
a
free
rental
car
for
the
day
and
a
half
that
i
wa
without
my
car
i
wa
quit
happi
with
the
way
they
handledespeci
consid
that
i
wa
expect
the
worst
from
them
ye
i
wa
pretti
amaz
when
i
had
my
car
in
for
some
touchup
adjust
thi
past
week
and
they
had
to
keep
it
overnight
too
busi
for
them
to
get
to
it
and
they
offer
to
pay
for
a
rental
they
did
make
me
pay
for
tax
and
insur
though
from
what
ive
heard
it
sound
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problem
with
the
probe
and
probabl
mx
when
they
first
went
into
product
but
i
think
these
problem
have
mostli
been
correct
at
thi
point
that
almost
alway
to
be
expect
with
a
complet
new
car
like
thi
though
i
have
to
agre
that
they
seem
to
have
some
qc
problesm
but
i
serious
feel
the
car
design
is
sound
and
expect
it
to
do
veri
well
