dont
buy
one
that
is
the
best
way
to
avoid
ticket
i
use
to
have
one
and
whenev
a
cop
would
pull
me
over
see
the
thing
give
me
a
ticket
one
time
my
sister
wa
drive
and
had
it
in
the
glove
compart
it
wa
broken
and
she
got
a
ticket
in
i
had
receiv
ticket
becaus
of
it
one
for
my
sister
so
a
total
of
five
that
wa
five
year
ago
now
i
dont
have
one
and
have
not
gotten
a
ticket
my
drive
habit
have
not
chang
drastic
onli
two
day
ago
i
wa
go
mph
on
highway
with
mph
limit
cop
saw
me
i
break
a
littl
noth
happen
i
wa
drive
a
minivan
with
my
famili
in
it
otherwis
i
have
cutlas
suprem
which
i
do
most
of
the
time
on
the
highway
so
basic
my
opnion
is
not
to
get
one
if
you
do
get
pull
over
the
cop
will
hear
your
excus
but
if
you
have
a
radar
detect
he
will
not
again
thi
ha
been
my
experienc
just
get
a
remot
model
that
is
not
visibl
to
the
cop
but
be
sure
to
get
front
and
rear
sensor
you
can
also
just
put
the
detector
off
to
the
side
on
the
dash
so
the
cop
doesnt
see
it
right
awayvalentin
is
the
best
detector
by
far
a
state
by
car
and
driver
and
even
tell
you
what
direct
the
radar
is
come
from
it
also
give
the
amount
of
threat
it
is
pick
up
so
if
you
go
through
the
same
place
everyday
and
it
alway
goe
off
there
you
can
glanc
at
the
number
of
threat
the
valentin
is
detect
to
see
if
it
is
a
genuin
cop
it
about
and
you
can
onli
get
it
