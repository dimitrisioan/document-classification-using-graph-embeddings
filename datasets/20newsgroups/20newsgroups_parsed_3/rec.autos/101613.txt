the
biggest
problem
some
peopl
seem
to
be
have
is
that
saturn
dealer
make
k
on
a
car
i
think
most
will
agre
with
me
that
the
car
is
compar
price
with
it
competitor
that
is
they
arent
overpr
compar
to
most
car
in
their
class
i
dont
understand
the
point
of
argu
over
whether
the
dealer
make
the
k
or
not
i
have
never
understood
what
the
big
deal
over
dealer
profit
is
either
the
onli
thing
that
i
can
figur
out
is
that
peopl
believ
that
if
they
minim
the
dealer
profit
they
will
minim
their
total
outofpocket
expens
for
the
car
while
thi
may
be
true
in
some
case
i
do
not
believ
that
it
is
gener
true
i
bought
a
saturn
sl
in
januari
of
at
that
time
base
on
studi
car
price
i
decid
that
there
wa
no
compar
car
that
wa
price
a
cheapli
a
the
saturn
sure
mayb
i
could
have
talk
the
price
for
some
other
car
to
the
saturn
price
but
my
outofpocket
expens
wouldnt
have
been
ani
differ
what
import
to
me
is
how
much
money
i
have
left
after
i
buy
the
car
reduc
dealer
profit
is
not
the
same
thing
a
save
money
show
me
how
reduc
dealer
profit
save
me
money
and
ill
believ
that
it
import
my
experi
ha
been
that
reduc
dealer
profit
doe
not
necessarili
save
me
money
fred
say
you
bought
your
saturn
at
k
with
a
dealer
profit
of
k
if
the
dealer
profit
is
then
you
would
onli
be
pay
k
for
the
same
car
so
isnt
that
save
money
ye
but
the
point
is
that
price
are
competet
saturn
may
well
be
sell
a
car
intend
on
give
the
dealer
a
profit
but
sinc
a
comper
honda
with
profit
is
more
expens
it
may
be
well
worth
it
to
buy
the
saturn
moreov
if
saturn
realli
doe
reduc
the
dealer
profit
margin
by
then
their
car
will
be
even
better
deal
say
if
the
price
of
a
saturn
wa
alreadi
below
market
averag
for
the
class
of
car
then
after
they
reduc
the
dealer
profit
it
would
be
below
market
averag
it
will
attract
even
more
peopl
to
buy
saturn
becaus
it
would
save
them
money
forc
the
competitor
to
lower
their
price
to
surviv
now
not
onli
will
saturn
owner
benefit
from
a
lower
dealer
profit
even
the
buyer
for
other
car
will
pay
le
not
necessarili
it
seem
to
me
that
saturn
salesdroid
who
dont
make
a
commis
wherea
their
counterpart
at
other
dealership
gener
do
make
more
per
hour
or
whatev
thi
mean
that
saturn
doesnt
give
up
the
profit
to
their
employe
through
commis
which
is
taken
out
of
per
car
profit
they
just
pa
it
along
to
le
pressur
salesmenwomen
isnt
that
save
money
mayb
mayb
not
depend
on
account
practic
id
rather
pay
more
for
dealer
servic
that
doesnt
cut
corner
to
contain
cost
