onli
a
rush
when
there
are
corner
that
you
dont
think
you
can
make
on
a
clear
autobahn
is
noth
in
the
u
of
peopl
and
all
judg
would
label
you
insan
and
it
is
difficult
to
persuad
peopl
otherwis
sure
but
the
surfac
condit
of
most
good
autobahn
is
far
better
the
qualiti
of
autobahn
is
someth
of
a
myth
the
road
surfac
isnt
much
differ
to
a
typic
tx
freeway
they
are
better
in
term
of
light
safeti
sign
roadmark
etc
id
have
no
problem
drive
on
most
u
freeway
a
it
is
i
save
it
for
the
backroad
which
realli
are
more
like
to
be
danger
than
most
of
the
road
here
a
dip
in
the
asphalt
that
you
test
your
shock
on
at
will
kill
you
at
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
to
it
would
have
to
be
quit
sever
i
dont
recal
ani
u
freeway
without
road
damag
warn
that
i
would
regard
a
unsaf
at
in
ani
decent
well
damp
car
note
that
my
definit
of
decent
well
damp
would
exclud
most
typic
american
sedan
drive
quickli
and
they
say
my
probe
will
do
but
that
more
than
ive
ever
tri
in
it
caus
there
isnt
a
decent
enough
piec
of
road
hereabout
i
dont
know
where
you
live
but
i
would
be
much
more
worri
about
cop
other
traffic
etc
than
the
road
surfac
at
it
just
isnt
that
fast
or
that
danger
if
you
have
a
probe
gt
no
problem
the
cyl
model
i
have
driven
would
be
like
to
be
unpredict
