anoth
even

it
sound
like
your
analysi
is
base
on
hypothesi
and
not
actual
use
the
valentin
id
like
to
give
some
feedback
base
on
real
life
experinc
i
keep
the

in
advanc
logic
mode
and
it
rare
light
up
a
a
christma
tree
the
onli
time
it
doe
is
when
i
am
in
the
middl
of
a
major
shop
area
and
then
it
make
sen
that
is
doe
sinc
there
are
sourc
come
from
mani
differ
direct
i
have
found
the
valentin
to
be
consist
in
it
report
of
bogey
regardless
of
ani
move
car
in
the
area
i
have
found
the
direct
indic
to
be
veri
use
in
one
case
there
wa
two
radar
trap
set
up
within
one
mile
of
each
other
a
i
pas
the
first
radar
trap
the
direct
indic
chang
then
the
detector
wa
set
off
again
point
in
the
forward
direct
with
other
radar
detector
i
would
have
assum
that
thi
wa
due
to
a
reflect
but
with
the
valentin
i
knew
there
wa
a
high
probabl
that
there
wa
anoth
trap
and
there
wa
on
other
occas
the
direct
help
discern
a
fals
alarm
from
a
true
alarm
for
exampl
a
i
pas
a
sourc
the
direct
indic
chang
the
direct
also
allow
me
to
focu
my
attent
a
to
where
the
signal
might
be
come
from
instead
of
have
to
look
all
over
the
place
when
a
car
is
approach
me
from
the
rear
with
a
detector
that
leak
i
can
tell
that
the
signal
is
come
from
the
rear
and
a
the
car
pas
me
i
can
verifi
the
sourc
with
other
detector
i
would
have
been
unabl
to
do
thi
and
would
have
had
to
assum
that
there
wa
a
radar
trap
when
there
wa
none
ive
had
the
valentin
for
sever
month
now
and
find
it
ad
featur
to
be
use
