it
that
there
were

i
wa
a
repeat
custom
of
their
and
that
they
should
learn
how
to
treat
customersetcetci
wa
still
pretti
steam
about
the
whole
affair
he
gave
me
the
line
about
hate
to
lose
a
custom
and
they
would
tri
to
find
a
solut
etc
etc
i
told
him
not

els
a
coupl
hour
later
the
owner
of
the
dealership
call

etc
and
said
that
they
would
cover
the
plu
knock
anoth
off

and
he
gave
me
hi
privat
direct
phone
number
hi
secretari
name
and
assur
me
that
they

a

etc
etc
etc
i
thought
about

for
a
few
hour
and
discuss
it
with
my
wife
and
we
decid
what
the
hellthat

went
back
the
next
day
to
pick
up
the
truck
i
receiv
the
royal
treatment
everyon
seem
to
know
about
the
incid
even
the
lot
boy
everyth
went
smoothli
and
i
wa
out
of
there
in
my
new
truck
in
about
min
so
i
guess
im
a
reason
satisfi
custom
howev
it
should
not
have
happen
in
the
first
place
i
wa
a
bit
shock
to
have
a
sale
person
talk
to
me
like
that
i
dont
expect
them
to
bow
and
grovel
but
i
sure
dont
expect
to
be
given
a
hard
time
either
esp
when
it
their
mistak
anyway
im
happi
with
the
truck
and
it
turn
out
to
be
a
coupl
hundr
dollar
under
invoic
and
they
paid
most
of
the
first
year
licens
fee
im
not
sure
whether
ill
go
back
to
that
dealer
tho
mark
