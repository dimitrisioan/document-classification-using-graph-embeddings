thank
darren
gibbon
thi
would
be
the
manta
would
it
not
sold
through
buick
dealer
in
the
mid
s
a
the
price
leader
sound
a
lot
more
like
an
opel
gt
to
me
id
guess
that
thi
is
on
the
same
chassi
a
the
kadett
rather
than
the
bigger
manta
but
i
could
easili
be
wrong
i
think
the
later
kadett
were
sold
here
a
buick
opel
craig
i
think
the
manta
is
the
european
name
for
the
gt
im
pretti
sure
well
the
european
manta
and
u
gt
have
entir
differ
bodi
there
is
littl
or
no
chanc
that
they
are
the
same
the
manta
went
through
sever
gener
a
the
coup
version
of
the
ascona
and
wa
ok
in
it
time
that
the
onli
kadett
sold
here
werear
the
pontiac
leman
i
think
the
not
true
the
kadett
ha
been
in
and
out
of
the
u
market
over
the
year
the
leman
old
kadett
is
onli
the
latest
version
craig
gt
is
just
an
earli
s
to
mid
s
manta
differ
car
one
look
like
a
sportscar
the
