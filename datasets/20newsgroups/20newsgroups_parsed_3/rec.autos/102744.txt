from
md
mike
wieda
howdi
im
a
littl
new
to
thi
newsgroup
but
i
would
like
to
tap
some
of
the
knowledg
and
expertis
avail
here
the
subject
aftermarket
cruis
control
the
background
i
recent
broke
my
ankl
in
a
roadbicycl
accid
place
five
screw
yuk
in
two
week
i
will
be
return
to
texa
my
home
from
my
school
byu
in
provo
utah
a
you
can
imagin
tri
to
drive
nearli
mile
with
a
broken
right
ankl
isnt
just
the
epitom
of
a
good
time
my
car
doe
not
have
a
cruis
control
so
i
would
have
to
do
all
the
pedal
ha
ha
with
my
messedup
ankl
my
question
what
is
the
gener
opinion
of
aftermarket
cruis
control
unit
i
realiz
that
a
cheap
cc
cruis
control
from
say
pep
boy
isnt
go
to
be
a
good
a
a
factori
or
profession
instal
unit
if
there
is
such
a
thing
and
i
uderstand
that
i
probabl
cant
expect
much
in
the
way
of
accuraci
look
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
anyth
got
ta
be
better
than
tri
to
drive
with
a
hose
ankl
i
have
a
jeep
cheroke
speed
standard
l
engin
with
ketteringsp
ignit
yknow
distributor
cap
rotor
that
setupnot
electron
mayb
you
couldv
guess
it
be
an
but
im
just
tri
to
give
inform
a
completli
a
i
can
i
found
a
cc
unit
for
buck
it
seem
to
use
the
vehicl
vacuum
system
instead
of
an
electr
servormotor
is
thi
good
or
bad
if
i
did
buy
thi
cc
which
vacuum
hose
should
i
tap
it
ha
two
speed
sensor
one
magnet
and
one
that
get
a
signal
from
the
neg
side
of
the
distributor
kinda
like
a
tach
pickup
or
so
i
understand
i
can
use
either
one
which
is
best
the
manual
say
i
read
it
in
the
store
today
that
the
magneticaxl
setup
is
more
accur
but
harder
to
instal
is
there
realli
a
big
differ
it
ha
a
sensor
for
the
brake
pedal
just
like
other
cc
but
doe
not
have
a
sensor
for
the
clutch
pedal
so
if
i
wasnt
pay
real
close
attent
i
might
push
the
clutch
in
while
the
cruis
is
tri
to
get
the
speed
up
which
would
wind
the
engin
up
kinda
high
until
i
got
my
wit
about
me
and
turn
the
thing
off
im
pretti
coordin
so
thi
doesnt
bother
me
if
it
were
for
my
girlfriend
car
then
it
would
bother
me
but
im
ok
with
it
the
instal
also
call
for
an
attach
to
a
steadyon
brake
signal
and
a
switchedon
brake
signal
i
think
i
can
get
a
switch
brake
signal
from
the
correct
side
of
the
brake
light
blade
fuse
am
i
right
but
im
not
sure
where
to
get
the
steadyon
brake
signal
or
for
that
matter
what
exactli
it
is
ani
idea
a
to
what
the
manufatur
want
and
where
to
get
it
i
think
i
can
figur
the
other
thing
out
like
how
to
hookup
the
neg
side
tachtyp
sens
gizmo
and
the
cabin
control
unit
and
the
ground
and
all
that
miscellan
busi
but

littl

the
money

a
devic
