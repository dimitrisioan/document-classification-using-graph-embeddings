i
thought
that
the
v
wa
origin
design
for
a
truck
not
necessarili
a
pickup
and
then
just
sort
of
drop
into
the
viper
frame
becaus
it
fit
and
wa
avail
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
saw
and
heard
a
viper
and
my
friend
first
respons
wa
that
it
sound
like
a
truck
it
sound
fine
to
me
but
then
again
i
dont
like
the
whini
nois
that
most
modern
sport
car
engin
make
btw
the
viper
we
saw
wa
move
at
about
mph
just
like
all
of
the
other
car
on
the
freeway
head
east
out
of
la
on
a
friday
afternoon
look
realli
nice
though
actual
i
wa
under
the
impress
that
the
v
in
the
viper
wa
not
the
v
that
dodg
wa
develop
for
it
new
kenworth
i
have
alway
thought
it
wa
the
exhaust
system
and
not
the
engin
that
produc
the
nois
of
a
car
well
ye
the
exhaust
is
where
the
major
of
the
nois
come
out
but
the
basic
tone
fire
cadenc
etc
are
determin
by
the
engin
configur
in
the
case
of
the
viper
ye
we
are
discuss
a
huge
multicylind
deg
engin
which
will
sound
somewhat
like
a
truck
and
my
understand
btw
is
that
that
v
engin
wa
design
origin
with
the
intent
of
be
ad
aptibl
for
either
the
truck
or
the
viper
and
from
what
ive
heard
no
first
hand
knowledg
it
do
a
pretti
good
job
at
both
and
the
best
exhaust
sound
in
the
world
is
now
and
will
alway
be
