apper
one

characterist
of

the

to

they

describ
a
field
marshal
thi
trait
is
veri
valuabl
and
essenti
in

we
need
peopl
who

to
lead

strive
to
overcom
the

to

thirst
for
knowledg
to
rais
the
level
of

etc
the
great
success
in
scienc
and
technolog
are
in
larg
part
due
to
the
vision
an

to

if

he

notor
at

should
not

call
elain
doctor
a

i
wa
concern
too
becaus
of
the
toxic
of

a
my
doctor
after
my
blood
test
put
me
on
iu
of
vitamin
a
for
one
week
onli
then
drop
it
down
to

for

coupl
of

i
also
receiv
zinc

sinc
all
of
these
interrel
in
fairli
complex
way
a
my
doctor
explain
he
one
of
those
evil
orthomolecular
specialist
i
had
a
blood
test
three
week
later
and
vitamin
a
wa

he
then
stop
me
on

some
in

made

that
i
maintain
a

hope
elain

will
take
a

if

improv
in

then
it
probabl
is
not

take
such
a
larg

and
risk
liver
damag
surviv
if
it
get
access
to
a

of

it
bloom
and
over
ride
the
other
organ
live
with
it
in
the
sinus
gi
tract
or
vagina
in
though
i
do
now
believ
base
on
my
success
therapi
with
sporanox
that
i
definit
had
some
excess
growth
of
fungu
unknown
speci
in
my
sinus
i
still
want
to
ask
the
question
have
there
been
ani
studi
that
demonstr
candida
bloom
in
the
sinus
with
associ
sinu
irrit
sinusitisrhin
my
sinu
irrit
reduc
significantli
after
one
week
of
sporanox
and
no
other
new
treatment
were
implement
dure
thi
time
i
did
not
have
ani
notic
gi
track
problem
befor
start
on
sporanox
but
some
for
a
few
day
after
which
then
went
away
consid
normal
btw
my
doctor
dug
out
one
of
hi
medic
refer
book
sorri
cant
rememb
which
one
and
found
an
obscur
comment
date
back
into
the
s
which
state
that
peopl
can
develop
contain
nonleth
or
nonseri
aspergillus
infest
aspergiliosi
of
the
sinus
lead
to
sinu
inflamm
symptom
ill
have
to
dig
out
that
refer
again
sinc
it
is
relev
to
thi
discus
some
peopl
do
realli
develop
a
bad
inflammatori
process
at
the
mucu
membran
or
skin
bloom
site
whether
thi
is
an
allerg
like
reaction
to
the
candida
or
not
isnt
certain
my
doctor
test
me
i
believ
a
rast
or
rast
similar
test
for
allerg
respons
to
specifici
candida
albican
and
i
show
a
strong
posit
anoth
question
would
everybodi
show
the
same
strong
posit
so
thi
test
is
essenti
useless
and
assum
it
is
true
that
candida
can
grow
partway
into
the
mucu
membran
tissu
and
the
concentr
exce
a
threshold
amount
could
not
a
person
who
test
a
have
an
allergi
to
candida
definit
develop
allerg
symptom
such
a
mucu
membran
irrit
due
to
the
bodi
allerg
respons
a
i
said
in
an
earlier
post
one
doe
not
need
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
or
have
a
md
degre
or
a
phd
in
biochemistri
to
see
the
plausibl
of
thi
hypothesi
btw
and
ill
repost
thi
again
dr
ivker
in
hi
book
sinu
surviv
ha
routin
given
befor
anyth
el
nizor
a
presporanox
system
antifung
not
a
safe
and
not
a
good
a
sporanox
to
hi
new
chronic
sinus
patient
if
they
have
been
on
antibiot
four
or
more
time
in
the
last
two
year
he
claim
that
out
of
or
so
patient
well
over
notic
some
relief
of
sinu
inflamm
and
other
symptom
but
it
doesnt
cure
it
by
ani
mean
impli
the
socal
yeastfungu
infect
is
not
the
primari
caus
but
a
later
complic
he
also
found
that
nystatin
whether
taken
intern
or
put
into
a
sinu
spray
doe
not
help
thi
impli
of
cours
assum
that
excess
yeastfungu
bloom
is
aggrav
the
sinu
inflamm
that
the
yeastfungu
ha
grown
partway
into
the
tissu
sinc
nystatin
will
not
kill
yeastfungu
other
than
by
direct
contact
it
is
not
absorb
into
the
blood
stream
again
i
admit
lot
of
if
and
impli
which
doesnt
plea
the
hardcor
nt
who
ha
to
have
the
doubleblind
studi
or
it
a
nonissu
but
one
ha
to
start
with
some
plausibl
hypothesisexplan
a
strawman
if
you
will
if
it
intern
onli
symptom
can
be
use
and
these
symptom
are
pretti
nondescript
thi
bring
up
an
interest
observ
use
by
those
who
will
deni
and
reject
ani
and
all
aspect
of
the
yeast
hypothesi
until
the
appropri
studi
are
done
and
that
is
if
you
cant
observ
or
cultur
the
yeast
bloom
in
the
gut
or
sinu
then
there
no
way
to
diagnos
or
even
recogn
the
diseas
and
i
know
they
realiz
that
it
is
virtual
imposs
to
test
for
candida
overbloom
in
ani
part
of
the
bodi
that
can
not
be
easili
observ
sinc
candida
is
everywher
in
the
bodi
it
a
real
catch
anoth
catch
those
who
total
reject
the
yeast
hypothesi
say
that
no
studi
have
been
done
actual
studi
have
been
done
but
if
it
not
up
to
a
certain
standard
then
it
is
from
their
perspect
a
nonstudi
which
should
not
even
be
consid
i
agre
that
the
appropri
studi
should
be
done
and
that
will
take
big
to
do
it
right
howev
in
order
to
convinc
the
fund
agenc
in
these
auster
time
to
open
their
wallet
you
liter
have
to
give
them
evid
and
the
onli
accept
evid
to
compet
with
other
propos
is
paradox
to
do
almost
the
exact
studi
need
fund
that
is
you
have
to
do
of
the
studi
befor
you
even
get
fund
a
a
scientist
at
a
nation
lab
im
veri
awar
of
thi
for
the
smaller
fund
project
im
afraid
that
even
if
dr
ivker
and
other
doctor
got
togeth
pool
their
practic
case
histori
and
anecdot
into
a
compel
pictur
and
approach
the
fund
agenc
they
would
get
nowher
even
if
they
were
abl
to
publish
their
statist
result
it
is
obviou
from
the
comment
by
some
of
the
doctor
here
is
that
they
have
decid
excess
yeast
colon
in
the
gut
or
sinus
lead
to
notic
nonleth
symptom
doe
not
exist
and
is
not
even
a
tenabl
hypothesi
so
ani
amount
of
case
histori
or
compil
anecdot
evid
to
the
contrari
will
never
chang
their
mind
and
not
onli
that
they
would
also
oppos
the
need
studi
becaus
in
their
mind
it
a
done
issu
excess
yeast
growth
lead
to
diffus
allerg
symptom
doe
not
will
not
and
can
not
exist
period
kind
of
tough
to
dialog
with
those
who
hold
such
a
viewpoint
kind
of
remind
me
of
lister
candida
is
kept
in
check
in
most
peopl
by
the
normal
bacteri
flora
in
the
sinus
the
gi
tractmouth
stomach
and
intestin
and
in
the
vagin
tract
which
compet
with
it
for
food
the
human
immun
system
usus
doe
not
bother
itself
with
thesenonpathogen
organ
unless
they
broach
the
mucu
membran
barrier
if
they
do
an
inflammatori
respons
will
be
set
up
most
american
are
not
get
enough
vitamin
a
from
their
diet
about
of
all
american
die
with

a
than
they
were
born
withu
autopsi
studi
while
thi
low
level
of
vitamin
a
doe
not
caus
pathologyblind
it
doe
impair
the
mucu

system
thi
would
then
be
a
predispos
factor
for
a
strong
inflammatori
respons
after
a
candida

arent
there
also
other
nutrient
necessari
to
the
proper
work
of
the
sinu
mucu
membran
and
cilium
while
diabet
can
suffer
from
a
candida
bloom
the
most
common
caus
of
thi
type
of
bloom
is
the
use
of
broad

antibiot
which
knock
down
mani
differ
kind
of
bacteria
in

remov
the
main
competit
for

a
far
a

is
concern
while
drug
are
avail

handl
candida
mani
patient
find
that
their
doctor
will
not
use
them
unless
there
is
evid
of
a
system
infect
the
toxic
of
the
antifung
drug
doe
warrant
some
caution
but
if
the
gi
or
sinu
inflamm
is
suspect
to
be
candidaand
recent
use
of
a
broad
spectrum
antibiot
is
the
smoke
gun
then
antifung
use
should
be
approrpri
just
a
the
antifung
cream
are
an
appropri
treatment
for
recur
vagin
yeast
infect
in
spite
of
what
mr
steve
dyer
say
again
the
evid
from
mycolog
studi
indic
that
mani
yeastfungu
speci
can
grow
hypha
root
into
deep
tissu
similar
to
mold
grow
in
bread
you
can
continu
to
kill
the
surfac
such
a
nystatin
doe
but
you
cant
kill
that
which
is
deeper
in
the
tissu
without
use
a
system
antifung
such
a
itraconazol
sporanox
or
some
of
the
older
one
such
a
nizor
which
are
more
toxic
and
not
a
effect
thi
is
whi
a
ha
been
point
out
by
recent
studi
sent
to
me
by
a
doctor
ive
been
in
email
contact
with
thank
that
nystatin
is
not
effect
in
the
long
term
treatment
of
gi
tract
candidiasi
it
like
tri
to
weed
a
garden
by
cut
off
what
abov
the
ground
but
leav
the
root
readi
to
come
out
again
onc
you
walk
away
the
question
is
whether
a
contain
candida
bloom
can
partial
grow
into
tissu
through
the
mucu
membran
caus
some
type
of
symptom
in
suscept
peopl
eg
allergi
without
becom
system
in
the
classic
sen
of
the
word
someth
in
between
strictli
an
excess
bloom
not
caus
ani
problem
and
the
fullblown
system
infect
that
is
potenti
lethal
in
the
gi
system
the
anorect
region
seem
to
be
a
particularli
good
reservoir
for
candida
and
the
use
of
pantyhos
by
mani
woman
creat
a
veri
favor
environ
around
the
rectum
for
transferthrough
moistur
and
humid
of
candida
to
the
vagin
tract
one
of
the
most
effctiv
way
to
minimm
thi
transfer
is
to
wear
undi
cotton
underwear
also
if
one
is
an
anal

steve
dyer
call
him
a

a
ive
said
in
privat
email
there
are
flaw
in
our
current
medic
system
that
make
it
difficult
or
even
imposs
for
a
physician
to
attempt
altern
therapi
after
the
approvedprovenaccept
therapi
dont
work
for
exampl
i
went
to
three
ent
who
all
said
that
i
will
just
have
to
live
with
my
acutechron
sinus
after
the
ab
fail
they
did
mention
surgeri
to
open
up
the
ostia
but
my
ostia
werent
plug
and
it
would
not
get
to
the
root

of
my
condit
after
three
month
of
aggress
and
fairli
nonstandard

sporanox
bodi

my

ha
vastli
improv
to
where
i
wa
two
year
ago
befor
my
health
greatli
deterior
of
cours
skeptic
would
say
that
mayb
if
i
did
noth
i
would
have
improv
anyway
but
that
view
is
stretch
thing
quit
far
becaus
of
the
experi
of
the
three
ent
i
saw
who
said
that
id
just
have
to
live
with
it
im
confid
i
will
reach
what
one
could
call
a
total
cure
the
antifung
program
i
undertook
wa
one
necessari
step
in
that
direct
becaus
of
my
overus
of
ab
for
the
last
four
year
note
for
those
have
sinu
problem
may
i
suggest
the
book
by
dr
ivker
i
mention
abov
be
sure
to
get
the
revis
edit
i
have
often
wonder
what
an
md
with
chronic
gi
distress
or
sinu
problem
would
do
about
the
problem
that
he
tell
hi
patient
is
a
nonexist
syndrom
dr
ivker
start
off
have
chronic
and
sever
sinu
problem
and
hi
visit
to
sever
ent
total
floor
him
when
they
said
youll
just
have
to
live
with
it
he
spent
sever
year
tri
everyth
standard
and
nonstandard
until
he
wa
essenti
cure
of
chronic
sinus
he
now
share
hi
approach
in
hi
book
and
i
can
honestli
say
that
i
am
on
the
road
to
recoveri
follow
some
part
of
it
hi
one
recommend
to
take
a
system
antifung
at
the
begin
of
treatment
if
you
have
a
histori
of
antibiot
overus
ha
been
proven
to
him
time
and
time
again
in
hi
own
practic
im
sure
if
i
comment
to
him
of
the
hardcor
belief
of
the
anti
yeast
hypothesi
poster
that
he
would
have
definit
thing
to
say
such
a
it
work
wonder
for
me
in
almost
two
thousand
case
to
put
it
mildli
i
also
would
not
be
surpris
if
he
would
say
that
they
are
the
one
violat
their
moral
oblig
to
help
the
patient
mayb
those
doctor
who
are
read
thi
who
have
a
practic
and
are
confront
by
a
patient
have
symptom
that
could
be
due
to
the
hypothet
yeast
overgrowth
eg
they
fit
some
of
the
profil
the
proyeast
peopl
have
identifi
should
consid
antifung
therapi
if
all
other
avenu
have
been
exhaust
rememb
theori
and
practic
are
two
differ
thing
you
can
not
have
one
without
the
other
they
are
synergist
if
a
doctor
doe
someth
nonstandard
yet
produc
notic
symptomat
relief
in
over
a
thousand
of
hi
patient
shouldnt
you
at
least
sit
up
and
take
notic
mayb
you
ought
to
trust
what
he
say
and
begin
hypothes
whi
it
work
instead
of
whi
it
shouldnt
work
im
afraid
a
lot
of
doctor
have
becom
so
enamor
with
scientif
correct
that
they
are
ignor
the
patient
they
have
sworn
to
help
you
have
to
do
both
both
have
to
be
balanc
which
we
dont
see
from
some
of
the
poster
to
thi
group
there
come
a
point
when
you
just
have
to
use
a
littl
common
sen
and
mayb
an
empir
approach
such
a
tri
a
good
system
antifung
such
a
sporanox
after
have
exhaust
all
the
other
avenu
i
wa
one
of
those
who
the
tradit
medic
establish
wa
not
abl
to
help
so
i
did
the
natur
thing
i
went
to
a
coupl
of
doctor
who
are
somewhat
outsid
thi
establish
and
a
a
result
i
have
found
signific
relief
would
it
not
be
better
if
the
tradit
medic
establish
can
set
up
some
kind
of
mechan
where
ani
doctor
without
fear
of
be
su
or
have
hi
licens
pull
can
tri
experiment
and
unproven
beyond
a
doubt
therapi
for
hisher
patient
that
final
reach
the
point
where
all
the
accept
therapi
are
ineffect
id
like
to
hear
a
doctor
tell
me
well
ive
tri
all
the
therapi
that
are
approv
and
accept
in
thi
countri
and
sinc
they
clearli
dont
work
for
you
i
now
have
the
author
to
use
experiment
unproven
techniqu
that
seem
to
have
help
other
i
cant
promis
anyth
and
there
are
some
risk
you
will
have
to
sign
someth
say
you
understand
the
experiment
and
possibl
riski
natur
of
these
unproven
therapi
and
ill
have
to
regist
your
case
at
the
state
board
anyway
if
my
ent
had
suggest
thi
to
me
i
wouldv
jump
on
thi
pronto
instead
of
go
to
one
of
those
doctor
who
for
either
altruist
reason
or
for
greed
is
practic
these
altern
therapi
with
much
risk
to
himher
risk
mean
lose
their
licens
and
possibl
to
the
patient
such
a
mechan
would
keep
control
in
the
more
mainstream
medicin
and
also
provid
valuabl
data
that
would
essenti
be
free
it
also
would
be
moral
and
ethic
better
than
the
current
system
by
show
the
compass
of
the
medic
commun
to
the
patient
that
it
do
everyth
it
can
within
reason
to
help
the
patient
it
is
the
lack
of
such
a
mechan
that
is
lead
larg
number
of
peopl
to
tri
altern
therapi
some
of
which
seem
to
work
like
my
