subject
re
scienc
and
methodolog
wa
homeopathi
tradit
i
think
that
part
of
the
problem
is
that
i
have
propos
a
definit
of
scienc
that
i
intend
to
be
interpret
broadli
and
that
lee
ladi
ha
interpret
fairli
narrowli
my
definit
is
thi
scienc
is
the
investig
of
the
empir
that
avoid
mistak
in
reason
and
methodolog
discov
from
previou
work
lee
ladi
write
i
dont
think
that
scienc
should
be
defin
in
a
way
that
some
of
the
activ
that
lead
to
realli
import
scienc
name
think
and
inform
explor
are
not
recogn
a
scientif
work
unless
one
classifi
think
and
inform
explor
a
a
mistak
they
fall
under
my
definit
i
hope
no
one
would
consid
specul
think
and
inform
explor
a
unscientif
in
articl
lee
ladi
write
serious
im
not
sure
whether
i
misjudg
you
or
not
in
one
respect
i
still
have
a
major
problem
though
with
your
insist
that
scienc
is
mainli
about
avoid
mistak
here
is
where
i
think
we
are
talk
at
crosspurpos
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
the
kind
of
definit
i
have
propos
should
be
taken
a
describ
what
scienc
is
mainli
about
consid
for
exampl
a
definit
of
invertebr
a
all
anim
lack
a
backbon
thi
fairli
tell
what
is
an
invertebr
and
what
is
not
an
invertebr
but
it
hardli
tell
you
what
invertebr
are
all
about
one
can
read
thi
definit
and
still
not
know
that
of
all
anim
speci
are
invertebr
that
invertebr
posse
a
remark
broad
rang
of
form
that
some
invertebr
group
such
a
insect
and
nematod
are
ubiquit
in
all
ecosystem
etc
in
short
know
the
definit
of
invertebr
doe
not
tell
one
what
they
are
mainli
about
the
misunderstand
here
is
my
fault
i
did
not
give
suffici
context
for
peopl
to
understand
my
propos
definit
okay
so
let
see
if
we
agre
on
thi
first
of
all
there
are
degre
of
certainti
it
might
be
appropri
for
instanc
to
demand
care
control
trial
befor
we
accept
a
absolut
scientif
truth
to
the
extent
that
there
is
ani
such
thing
the
effect
of
a
certain
treatment
on
the
other
hand
highli
favor
clinic
experi
even
if
uncontrol
can
be
adequ
to
justifi
a
preliminari
judgement
that
a
treatment
is
use
secondli
it
make
sen
to
be
more
toler
in
our
standard
of
evid
for
a
pronounc
effect
than
for
one
that
is
margin
i
agre
on
both
count
a
an
exampl
of
the
second
it
would
onli
take
a
few
case
of
cure
rabi
to
convinc
most
veterinarian
that
a
treatment
wa
effect
despit
a
lack
of
control
a
to
the
first
i
do
not
think
it
is
use
to
talk
about
absolut
scientif
truth
i
think
it
is
more
use
to
talk
about
the
kind
of
evid
that
variou
claim
have
and
the
kind
of
evid
in
particular
field
that
in
the
past
have
proven
faulti
or
reliabl
the
latter
is
obvious
a
matter
of
degre
and
in
each
field
practition
tri
to
discov
the
relev
of
differ
kind
of
evid
one
of
the
primari
mistak
that
mark
the
advocaci
of
an
idea
a
psuedosci
is
that
the
advocaci
lack
ani
sen
of
proport
regard
the
kind
of
evid
relat
to
the
propos
claim
the
kind
of
evid
that
are
actual
relev
to
it
and
the
histor
reason
in
the
field
that
certain
kind
of
evid
are
given
more
weight
than
other
it
is
perfectli
alright
to
specul
i
have
read
quit
a
few
refere
paper
that
specul
left
and
right
but
the
author
were
care
to
identifi
the
notion
a
specul
to
list
what
littl
evid
wa
present
avail
for
them
and
to
describ
how
research
could
proceed
to
either
put
the
notion
on
more
firm
foot
or
to
uncov
it
problem
often
what
distinguish
whether
a
paper
of
thi
sort
pas
muster
is
the
thought
with
which
the
author
set
the
context
and
pave
the
way
for
futur
work
it
is
in
thi
area
that
mani
propon
of
specul
idea
fail
the
folk
over
in
scipsycholog
have
a
hundr
and
one
excus
not
to
make
thi
simpl
test
they
claim
that
onli
an
elabor
outcom
studi
will
be
satisfactori
a
studi
of
the
sort
that
nlp
practition
mani
of
whom
make
a
bare
margin
live
from
their
practic
can
ill
afford
to
do
most
of
them
are
also
just
plain
not
interest
becaus
the
whole
idea
seem
frivol
and
sinc
theyr
not
part
of
the
scientif
establish
they
have
no
tangibl
reward
to
gain
from
scientif
accept
i
think
a
lot
of
scientist
steer
away
from
thing
that
deserv
or
not
garner
a
patina
of
kooki
when
propon
of
some
practic
see
no
valu
in
more
care
investig
of
that
practic
that
set
alarm
ring
in
mani
research
mind
thi
is
unfortun
becaus
there
is
undoubtedli
some
intersect
between
thing
that
are
worth
investig
and
thing
that
are
advoc
by
those
who
seem
careless
or
unreason
in
their
advocaci
on
the
other
hand
i
can
understand
whi
mani
scientist
would
just
a
soon
select
other
direct
for
research
a
gordon
bank
ha
point
out
no
one
want
to
becom
thi
gener
rhine
one
academ
in
scipsycholog
said
that
it
would
be
complet
unscientif
for
him
to
test
the
phobia
cure
sinc
it
hasnt
been
describ
in
a
scientif
journal
i
think
thi
is
absurd
actual
at
least
one
fairli
care
academ
studi
ha
been
done
with
favor
result
but
it
appar
not
accept
becaus
it
a
doctor
dissert
and
not
publish
in
a
refere
journal
i
wonder
whi
the
result
were
not
publish
in
my
field
dissert
result
are
typic
summar
in
paper
that
are
submit
to
journal
often
the
paper
are
accept
for
public
befor
the
dissert
is
finish
thi
certainli
ea
one
defens
final
i
hope
lee
ladi
will
forgiv
me
from
comment
either
on
nlp
or
the
discus
of
it
in
scipsycholog
i
know
littl
about
either
and
so
have
noth
to
offer
russel
