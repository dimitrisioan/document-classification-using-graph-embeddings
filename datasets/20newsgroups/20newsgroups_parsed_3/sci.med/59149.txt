cornbas
after
your

i
look
in
the
literatur
and
locat
two
articl
that
implic
corn
contain
tryptophan
and
seizur
the
idea
is
that
corn
in

a
coupl
of
folk
have
suggest
the
corn
connect
in
the
five
month
period
between
the
two
seizur
my
daughter
had
eaten
a
fair
amount
of
kix
and
berri
berri
kix
in
the
morn
and
never
had
a
problem
i
check
the
label
and
the
first
ingredi
is
corn
she
ha
also
never
had
a
problem
eat
corn
or
corn
on
the
cob
but
of
cours
that
is
usual
later
in
the
day
with
a
full
stomach
so
the
absorpt
would
not
be
so
high
i
do
believ
that
frost
flake
have
corn
in
them
but
i
will
have
to
check
the
fruit
loop
but
the
fact
that
she
ha
eaten
thi
other
corni
cereal
in
the
morn
make
me
wonder
thank
for
check
into
thi
all
