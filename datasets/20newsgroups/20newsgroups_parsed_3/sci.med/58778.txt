re
scienc
and
methodolog
in
articl
lee
ladi
write
the
differ
between
a
nobel
prize
level
scientist
and
a
mediocr
scientist
doe
not
lie
in
the
qualiti
of
their
empir
methodolog
it
depend
on
the
qualiti
of
their
think
it
realli
bother
me
that
so
mani
graduat
student
seem
to
believ
that
they
are
do
scienc
mere
becaus
they
are
conduct
empir
studi
and
im
especi
offend
by
russel
turpin
repeat
assert
that
scienc
amount
to
noth
more
than
avoid
mistak
simpli
avoid
mistak
doesnt
get
you
anywher
i
think
that
lee
ladi
and
i
are
talk
at
cross
purpos
abov
ladi
seem
concern
with
the
contrast
between
great
scienc
that
make
big
advanc
in
our
knowledg
and
mediocr
scienc
that
make
smaller
step
in
most
of
thi
thread
i
have
been
concern
with
the
differ
between
what
is
scienc
and
what
is
not
lee
ladi
is
correct
when
she
assert
that
the
differ
between
einstein
and
the
averag
postdoc
physicist
is
the
qualiti
of
their
thought
but
what
is
the
differ
between
einstein
and
a
geniu
who
would
be
a
great
scientist
but
whose
great
thought
are
scientif
screwi
some
would
give
velikovski
or
korzybski
a
exampl
if
you
dont
like
these
choos
your
own
i
say
it
is
the
same
a
the
differ
between
the
mediocr
physicist
and
the
mediocr
propon
of
qi
both
einstein
and
the
mediocr
physcist
have
disciplin
their
work
from
the
cumul
knowledg
of
how
previou
research
went
wrong
both
velikovski
and
the
mediocr
propon
of
qi
have
fail
to
do
thi
let
me
approach
thi
from
a
second
direct
when
one
is
ask
to
review
a
paper
for
a
journal
or
confer
there
are
mani
kind
of
critic
that
one
can
make
one
kind
of
critic
is
that
the
work
is
just
wrong
or
misinform
anoth
kind
of
critic
is
that
the
work
while
technic
correct
is
either
not
import
or
not
interest
the
first
differ
is
the
one
that
i
have
been
point
to
the
second
differ
is
the
one
that
lee
ladi
seem
to
be
discuss
if
good
empir
research
were
done
and
show
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopath
remedi
thi
would
certainli
be
valuabl
inform
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathi
qualifi
a
a
scienc
thi
is
where
you
and
i
disagre
with
turpin
i
have
often
point
out
that
for
homeopathi
to
be
consid
scientif
what
is
need
is
a
test
of
it
theoret
claim
not
just
of
some
of
it
propos
remedi
similarli
i
suspect
that
tradit
chines
medicin
ha
mani
remedi
that
work
what
it
lack
a
one
exampl
is
ani
experi
that
test
the
presenc
of
qi
in
order
to
have
scienc
one
must
have
a
theoret
structur
that
make
sens
not
a
mere
collect
of
empir
valid
random
hypothesi
certainli
a
theoret
structur
that
make
sens
is
the
goal
in
area
where
we
do
not
yet
have
thi
i
see
noth
wrong
with
form
and
test
smaller
hypothesi
let
face
it
we
can
not
alway
wait
for
an
einstein
to
come
along
and
make
everyth
clear
for
u
sometim
those
of
u
who
are
not
einstein
have
to
plug
along
and
make
small
amount
of
progress
a
best
we
can
russel
