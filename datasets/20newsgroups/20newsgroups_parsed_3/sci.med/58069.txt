dn
a
neurolog
dn
consult
is
cheaper
than
a
scan
and
also
better
becaus
a
neurologist
can
make
a
differenti
diagnosi
between
migrain
tensiontyp
headach
cluster
benign
intracrani
hypertens
chronic
paroxysm
hemicrania
and
other
headach
syndrom
that
all
appear
normal
on
a
scan
a
neurologist
can
also
recommend
a
cours
of
treatment
that
is
appropri
to
the
diagnosi
dn
