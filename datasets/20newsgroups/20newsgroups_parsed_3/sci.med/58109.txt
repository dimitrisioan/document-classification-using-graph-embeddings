re
sinu
v
migrain
wa
re
sinu
endoscopi
i
notic
sever
year
ago
that
when
i
took
analges
fairli
regularli
motrin
at
the
time
i
seem
to
get
a
lot
of
migrain
but
had
forgotten
about
that
until
i
start
read
some
of
the
post
here
i
gener
dont
take
nsaid
or
tylenol
for
headach
becaus
ive
found
them
to
be
ineffect
howev
i
have
two
other
pain
sourc
that
forc
me
to
take
nsaid
current
naprosyn
first
is
some
pelvic
pain
that
i
get
at
the
begin
of
my
period
and
then
much
wors
at
midcycl
i
have
had
surgeri
for
endometriosi
in
the
past
year
ago
so
the
dr
tell
me
that
my
pain
is
probabl
due
to
the
endometriosi
come
back
ive
tri
synarel
it
reduc
the
pain
while
i
took
it
mo
but
the
pain
return
immedi
after
i
stop
three
doctor
have
suggest
hysterectomi
a
the
onli
real
solut
to
my
problem
although
i
dont
expect
to
have
ani
more
child
i
dont
like
the
idea
of
have
my
uteru
and
one
remain
ovari
remov
the
first
ovari
wa
remov
when
i
had
the
surgeri
for
endometriosi
one
of
the
dr
that
suggest
i
get
a
hysterectomi
is
an
expert
in
laser
surgeri
but
perhap
think
that
type
of
procedur
is
onli
worthwhil
on
woman
who
still
plan
to
have
child
so
basic
all
im
left
with
is
tough
out
the
pain
thi
would
be
imposs
without
naprosyn
or
someth
similar
but
not
aspirin
that
doesnt
work
and
motrin
gave
me
horribl
gastriti
a
few
year
ago
so
im
through
with
it
in
fact
naprosyn
work
veri
well
at
elimin
the
pain
if
i
take
it
regularli
a
i
did
when
i
had
sever
back
pain
and
pain
in
both
leg
a
ill
discus
in
a
moment
gener
though
i
wait
until
i
have
the
pain
befor
i
take
the
naprosyn
but
then
it
take
sever
hour
for
it
reduc
the
pain
it
actual
quit
effect
at
reduc
the
pain
it
just
take
quit
a
while
in
the
meantim
im
frequent
in
sever
pain
the
other
pain
sourc
i
have
is
chronic
lower
back
pain
result
in
bilater
radiculopathi
ive
had
mri
xray
ct
scan
and
emg
ive
had
of
them
and
dont
intend
to
ever
do
that
again
with
nerv
conduct
test
the
test
have
not
been
conclus
a
to
what
is
caus
my
back
and
leg
pain
the
mri
report
both
say
i
have
sever
bulg
degeneratig
disk
and
from
the
xray
and
mri
i
think
it
is
appar
that
i
have
arthriti
the
read
on
the
ct
scan
wa
that
there
are
two
herniat
ll
and
ll
but
other
hav
look
at
the
film
and
conclud
that
there
are
no
herniat
the
second
emg
and
nerv
conduct
studi
show
signific
denerv
compar
to
the
first
emg
oh
yeah
i
had
some
other
horribl
test
call
someth
like
somat
evok
respons
which
show
that
the
intern
nerv
are
work
fine
anyway
the
bottom
line
is
that
i
sometim
have
sever
pain
in
both
leg
and
back
pain
the
back
pain
is
there
all
the
time
but
i
can
live
with
it
when
the
leg
pain
is
there
i
need
some
analgesicantiinflammatori
medic
to
reduc
the
pain
to
a
level
where
i
can
work
so
i
took
naprosyn
regulari
for
month
everi
time
i
tri
to
stop
the
leg
pain
got
wors
so
id
alway
resum
sinc
last
novemb
i
have
taken
it
much
le
frequent
and
primarili
for
the
pelvic
pain
i
have
been
go
to
physic
therapi
for
the
last
month
time
a
week
after
the
first
month
or
so
my
therapist
put
me
on
pelvic
traction
she
had
tri
it
earlier
but
it
had
caus
a
lot
of
pain
in
my
back
thi
time
she
tri
it
at
a
lower
weight
after
a
month
or
two
the
pain
in
my
leg
began
go
away
but
the
traction
away
caus
discomfort
in
my
lower
back
which
could
be
reduc
with
ultrasound
and
massag
so
now
i
dont
have
nearli
a
much
pain
in
my
leg
in
fact
my
therapist
took
me
off
traction
about
week
ago
get
back
to
my
origin
reason
for
thi
post
even
if
i
can
avoid
take
analges
for
headach
i
realli
cant
avoid
them
entir
becaus
i
have
other
pain
sourc
that
forc
me
to
use
them
oh
i
forgot
to
mention
that
it
ha
been
suggest
to
me
that
i
have
back
surgeri
but
im
avoid
that
too
i
find
the
migrain
difficult
to
deal
with
occassion
i
have
to
take
off
work
but
usual
i
can
work
but
at
a
reduc
capac
im
a
system
engin
and
do
a
lot
of
read
and
write
when
the
pelvic
pain
is
bad
i
cant
concentr
much
i
usual
end
up
jump
out
of
my
chair
everi
few
minut
becaus
the
pain
is
so
bothersom
when
the
pain
in
my
back
is
bad
it
can
caus
sever
burn
in
both
leg
shoot
pain
in
my
leg
electr
shock
type
of
pain
in
my
foot
and
toe
and
basic
when
it
get
bad
i
cant
realli
sit
at
all
then
i
end
up
spend
most
of
my
time
home
and
in
bed
so
even
if
the
analges
contribut
to
the
migrain
the
migrain
are
more
toler
than
the
other
pain
sourc
i
get
a
lot
of
migrain
an
averag
of
to
a
month
which
last
day
ive
taken
cafergot
the
first
time
the
caffien
realli
got
to
me
so
i
reduc
the
dosag
but
i
dont
like
the
side
effect
if
i
take
more
than
two
i
get
diahrea
if
i
get
a
veri
bad
headach
i
will
eventu
take
the
cafergot
my
neurologist
wasnt
veri
help
when
i
told
him
my
problem
with
cafergot
he
said
that
when
sumatriptan
becom
avail
i
should
tri
that
ive
tri
sever
other
medic
fiornal
midrin
fiornal
with
codein
tegretol
and
inder
but
they
either
didnt
work
or
i
couldnt
toler
them
so
what
can
i
do
my
doctor
seem
to
be
satisfi
with
me
just
tri
to
toler
the
pain
which
i
agre
with
most
of
the
time
but
not
when
i
have
a
lot
of
pain
ive
had
some
bad
experi
with
surgeri
my
heart
stop
onc
from
the
anesthesia
i
wa
told
that
it
wa
like
the
succinylcholin
and
ive
alreadi
had
surgeri
sever
time
anyway
the
point
of
what
im
say
is
that
even
if
analges
can
contribut
to
migrain
some
peopl
need
to
take
them
to
toler
other
pain
