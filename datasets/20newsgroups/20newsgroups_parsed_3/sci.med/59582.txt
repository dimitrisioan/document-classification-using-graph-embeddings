bogu
see
the
sciskept
faq
i
edit
it
you
can
diagnos
some
thing
by
look
at
the
eye
glaucoma
is
the
classic
exampl
but
there
are
probabl
other
iridolog
map
part
of
the
bodi
onto
the
iris
of
the
eye
by
look
at
the

in
the
iris
you

ill
all
over
the
bodi
the
two
question
to
ask
ani
altern
therapist
are
how
doe
it
work
what
evid
is
there
the
answer
to
question
take
a
littl
knowledg
of
medicin
to
evalu
i
dont
know
about
iridolog
but
ive
read
a
book
on
reflexolog
which
is
a
remark
similar
notion
except
that
the
organ
of
the
bodi
are
map
onto
the
sole
of
the
foot
there
are
suppos
to
be
channel
run
down
the
bodi
carri
inform
or
energi
of
some
sort
anatomist
have
found
no
such
structur
alway
bewar
the
word
channel
and
energi
in
ani
spiel
put
out
by
an
altern
practition
the
answer
to
question
is
rather
simpler
if
all
they
have
is
anecdot
evid
then
forget
it
ask
for
referre
paper
in
mainstream
medic
journal
ignor
ani
bull
about
the
conspiraci
of
rich
doctor
suppress
altern
practition
studi
are
done
and
paper
are
publish
some
of
them
are
even
posit
the
word
licens
in
the
flyer
is
an
interest
one
licens
by
whom
for
what
it
is
quit
possibl
that
the
herbolog
is
real
and
requir
a
licens
you
can
kill
someon
by
give
them
the
wrong
plant
to
eat
and
mani
plant
contain
veri
power
drug
foxglov
and
willow
spring
to
mind
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
licens
extend
to
the
iridolog
and
i
suspect
that
if
you
ask
you
will
be
told
that
it
mean
licens
herbologist
and
iridologist

the
usual
term
is
