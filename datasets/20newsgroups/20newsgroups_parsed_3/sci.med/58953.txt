and
use
it
if
necessari
i
have
been
use
it
for
about

and
protrud
about
abov
the

nonremov
they
are
locat
more
toward

be
posit
at
the
base
of
the
neck
or
the
top
of
the

depend
on
which
direct
you
approach

vari
the
amount
of

allow
all
or
part
of
the
full
weight
of
the
head
andor
neck
to
rest
on
the
thumb
the
handl
can
also
be
use
if
sit
or
stand
appli
pressur
with
the
armswrist
sinc
my
wrist
are
also
impair
im
type
thi
over
an
extend
period
of
time
and
i
dont
have
someon
live
with
me
who
can
appli
it
lay
down
work
well
for
me
for
my
back
i
sit
in
a
highback
kitchen
chair
posit
the
massag
behind
me
at
whatev
point
i
want
massag
and
lean
back
lightli
or
not
so
lightli
against
it
the
pressur
of
lean
back
hold
it
in
place
if
i
want
to
massag
the
entir
spine
i
simpli
move
it
down
a
few
inch
whenev
i
feel
like
it
for
my
back
thi
machin
is
far
superior
to
use
than
the
commonli
use
homemad
massag
of
tenni
ball
tape
togeth
with
the
ball
posit
against
a
wall
or
door
them
over
the
spine
and
move
the
bodi
up
and
down
against
them
the
tenni
ball
are
better
than
noth
but
difficult
to
use
for
veri
long
especi
if
your
quad
are
not
in
good
shape
and
my
long
hair
get
pain
in
the
way
if
i
dont
pin
it
up
first
a
far
a
im
concern
the
easier
someth
like
thi
is
to
use
the
more
like
ill
usedo
it
if
there
are
multipl
considerationshassl
im
more
like
to
not
bother
with
it
not
onli
ha
thi
machin
help
with
my
headach
but
my
rang
of
motion
for
my
neck
and
back
are
greatli
increas
the
first
time
i
use
it
on
my
necksuboccipit
muscl
howev
i
overdid
it
and
press
too
hard
against
it
which
result
in
a
veri
tender
almost
bruis
area
for
a
few
day
i
laid
off
it
for
about
day
and
appli
ice
which
help
after
that
i
wa
more
gradual
about
appli
pressur
at
thi
point
the
pain
in
the
suboccipit
area
is
now
minim
while
be
massag
i
also
learn
to
use
veri
light
pressur
on
my
lower
back
which
is
the
most
vulner
point
for
me
it
also
ea
some
pain
knot
of
tension
between
my
shoulder
blade
although
again
it
took
a
few
day
of
massag
just
a
few
minut
at
a
time
to
realli
work
it
out
i
highli
recommend
thi
product
if
you
have
similar
problem
although
i
can
not
vouch
for
it
durabl
it
seem
pretti
sturdi
sinc
ive
had
it
such
a
short
time
i
plan
to
use
it
not
onli
to
ea
tension
but
also
to
loosen
the
muscl
befor
exercis
and
mayb
after
too
i
have
been
ill
recent
and
not
abl
to
