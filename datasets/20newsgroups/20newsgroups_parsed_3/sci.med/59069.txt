ah
there
go
my
sinu
again
for
exampl
dr
ivker
who
wrote

surviv
alway
give
oh
wow
a
classic
textbook
hey
they
laugh
at
einstein
too
befor
ani
other
treatment
a
system
antifung
such
a
nizor
to
hi
new
patient
if

on
braodspectrum
antibiot
or

of
hi

of
allergicsinu
symptom
of
cours
thi
is
onli
the
begin
for
hi
program
yeah
ill
bet
tomorrow
the
world
listen
uncontrol
studi
like
thi
are
worthless
in
my
case
a
i
report
a
few
week
ago
i
wa
develop
the
classic
symptom
outlin
in
the
yeast
connect
i
agre
it
is
a
poorli
written
book
eg
extrem
sensit
to
plastic
vapor
etc
which
i
never
had
befor
start
in
novemb
within
one
week
of
full
dosag
of
sporanox
the
sensit
to
chemic
ha
fulli
disappear
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
die
after
two
minut
im
also
greatli
improv
in
other
area
a
well
im
sure
you
are
you
sound
like
the
typic
hysterichypochondriac
who
respond
to
miracl
cure
of
cours
i
have
allergi
symptom
etc
i
am
especi
allerg
to
mold
yeast
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figur
out
that
if
one
ha
excess
colon
of
yeast
in
the
bodi
and
you
have
a
natur
allergi
to
yeast
that
a
threshold
would
be
reach
where
you
would
have
percept
symptom
yeah
it
make
sens
to
me
so
of
cours
it
should
be
taken
serious
snort
also
yeast
do
produc
toxin
of
variou
sort
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realiz
that
such
toxin
can
caus
problem
in
some
peopl
yeah
it
sound
reason
to
me
of
cours
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immun
compromis
a
test
show
i
wa
from
over
year
of
antibiot
nutritionallydefici
becaus
of
the
stress
of
infect
and
allergi
etc
oh
realli
what
test
immunecompromis
my
as
more
like
credul
malinger
thi
is
a
psychiatr
syndrom
can
develop
excess
yeast
colon
somewher
in
the
bodi
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
sinc
test
for
excess
yeast
colon
is
not
easi
one
almost
ha
to
take
an
empir
approach
to
diagnosi
fortun
sporanox
is
rel
safe
unlik
past
antifung
still
have
to
be
care
howev
so
there
no
reason
ani
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empir
reason
you
know
it
a
shame
that
a
drug
like
itraconazol
is
be
misus
in
thi
way
it
ridicul
expens
and
potenti
toxic
the
troubl
is
that
it
isnt
toxic
enough
so
it
get
abus
by
quack
btw
some
would
say
to
tri
nystatin
unfortun
most
yeast
grow
hypha
too
deep
into
tissu
for
nystatin
to
have
ani
perman
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
peopl
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
the
onli
good
thing
about
nystatin
is
that
it
rel
cheap
and
when
taken
oral
nontox
but
oral
nystatin
is
without
ani
system
effect
so
unless
it
were
given
iv
it
would
be
without
ani
effect
on
your
sinu
i
wish
these
quack
would
first
use
iv
nystatin
or
amphotericin
b
on
peopl
like
you
that
would
solv
the
yeast
problem
onc
and
for
all
in
summari
i
appreci
all
of
the
attempt
by
those
who
desir
to
keep
medicin
on
the
right
road
but
methink
that
some
who
hold
too
firmli
to
the
parti
line
are
academ
who
havent
been
in
the
trench
long
enough
actual
treat
patient
if
anybodi
doctor
includ
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evid
of
the
yeast
connect
i
can
not
guarante
their
safeti
for
their
incompet
rip
off
their
lip
is
justifi
a
far
a
i
am
concern
perhap
a
littl
haldol
would
go
a
long
way
toward
amelior
your
symptom
are
you
pay
for
thi
treatment
out
of
your
own
pocket
id
hate
to
think
my
insur
premium
are
go
toward
thi
steve
dyer
dyer
your
rude
medicin
is
not
a
totallli
scientif
endevour
it
often
practic
in
a
disorgan
manner
most
earli
treatment
of
nonlif
threaten
ill
is
done
on
a
guess
hazard
after
anecdot
evid
given
by
the
patient
it
an
educ
guess
by
a
train
person
but
it
still
no
more
than
a
guess
it
cheaper
and
simpler
to
medic
first
and
onli
deal
further
with
those
peopl
who
dont
respond
there
are
diseas
that
havent

and
the

it
the

they

it
