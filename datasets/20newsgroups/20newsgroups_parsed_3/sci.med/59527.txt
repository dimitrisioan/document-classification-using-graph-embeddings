not

here
to

book
becaus
i
dont
know
what
in
that
book
plain
and
simpl
and
to
be
honest
with
you
im
begin
to
wish
that
it
wa
never
written
i
agre
with
thi
consensu
that
it
should
not
have
been
written
the
way
it
wa
my
doctor
who
claim
to
have
introduc
dr
crook
to
the
possibl
of
candida

way
back
in
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
him
on
thi
doe
not
like
the
book
becaus
it
make
too
mani
unfound
claim
and
is
horribl
written
from
a
scientif
viewpoint
on
the
other
hand
my
doctor
ha
alway
kept
an
open
mind
on
the
subject
and
doe
believ
in
aspect
of
the
yeast
connect
but
i
believ
there
is
some
truth
to
the
book
hope
the
right
clinic
studi
can
be
done
to
separ
the
fact
