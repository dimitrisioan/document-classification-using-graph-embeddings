be
treat
with
halydol
with
some
success
but
the
treatment
be
provid
through
her
psychiatrist
are
not
satisfactori
someon
suggest
contact
a
nutritionist
to
discus
altern
treatment
sinc
she
is
sensit
to
medic
i
think
thi
is
a
good
suggest
but
dont
know
where
to
begin
if
anyon
can
suggest
a
philli
area
nutritionist
or
el
some
literatur
to
read
id
appreci
it
lida
i
can
emphas
with
your
situat
both
my
wife
and
i
suffer
from
bout
of
depress
her
wa
brought
on
by
breast
cancer
and
mine
wa
a
rebound
stress
reaction
to
her
modifi
radic
mastectomi
and
chemotherapi
lida
i
use
my
knowledg
of
nutrit
to
get
her
through
her
six
month
of
chemotherapywith
the
approv
of
her
oncologist
when
sever
depress
set
in
a
few
month
after
the
chemo
stop
i
tri
to
use
supplement
to
bring
her
out
of
it
i
had
cure
her
pm
use
supplement
and
i
realli
thought
that
i
knew
enough
about
the
role
of
diet
in
depress
to
take
care
of
her
depress
a
well
it
didnt
work
and
she
wa
put
on
prozac
by
her
oncologist
two
winter
agothre
year
after
by
wife
breast
cancer
i
got
hit
with
sever
depressionpretti
typic
and
one
reason
whi
mani
marriag
break
up
after
breast
cancer
or
anoth
stressor
i
tri
to
take
care
of
it
for
sever
month
with
supplement
didnt
work
my
internist
end
up
put
me
on
prozac
i
wa
go
to
give
you
a
list
of
sever
studi
that
have
been
done
use
b
niacin
folat
and
b
to
cure
depress
im
not
go
to
do
that
becaus
all
you
would
be
do
is
fli
blind
like
i
wa
lida
i
do
believ
that
depress
can
have
a
dietari
compon
but
the
problem
is
that
you
need
to
know
exactli
what
the
problem
is
and
then
use
an
approach
which
will
fix
the
problem
for
chemotherapi
i
knew
exactli
what
drug
were
go
to
be
use
and
exactli
what
nutrient
would
be
affect
same
thing
for
pm
i
wa
fli
blind
for
both
of
these
stressor
but
the
literatur
that
i
use
to
devi
a
treatment
program
wa
pretti
good
depress
is
just
too
complic
what
you
realli
need
is
a
nutrit

is
not
a
diet

an
