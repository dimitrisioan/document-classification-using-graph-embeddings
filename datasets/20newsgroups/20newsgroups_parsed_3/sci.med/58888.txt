re
how
about
a
crash
program
in
basic
immunolog
research
in
articl
gari
kronk
write
i
have
been
contempl
thi
idea
for
some
time
a
well
i
am
not
a
doctor
but
my
wife
is
a
nurs
and
i
know
a
lot
of
doctor
and
nurs
the
point
here
be
that
doctor
and
nurs
do
not
seem
to
get
sick
nearli
a
much
a
peopl
outsid
the
medic
profess
thi
is
a
love
area
for
anecdot
but
i
am
sure
you
are
on
to
someth
a
a
physician
i
almost
never
get
sick
usual
when
someth
horrend
is
go
around
i
either
dont
get
it
at
all
or
get
a
veri
mild
case
when
i
do
get
realli
sick
it
is
alway
someth
unusu
thi
wa
not
the
situat
when
i
wa
in
medic
school
particularli
on
pediatr
i
never
had
younger
sibl
myself
and
when
i
went
on
the
pediatr
ward
i
suddenli
found
myself
confront
all
sort
of
infecti
challeng
that
my
bodi
wa
not
readi
for
pediatr
for
me
wa
three
solid
month
of
ill
and
i
had
a
temp
of
when
i
took
the
final
exam
i
think
what
happen
is
that
dure
train
and
beyond
we
are
constantli
expo
to
new
thing
and
we
have
the
usual
reaction
to
them
so
that
later
on
when
challeng
with
someth
it
is
more
like
a
reexposur
for
u
so
we
deal
with
it
well
and
get
a
mild
ill
i
dont
think
it
is
that
the
immun
system
is
hype
up
in
ani
way
also
dont
forget
that
the
hospit
flora
is
veri
differ
from
the
home
and
we
carri
a
lot
of
that
around
km
