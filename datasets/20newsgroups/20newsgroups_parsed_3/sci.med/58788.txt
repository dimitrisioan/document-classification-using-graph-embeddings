dont

extrascientif
is
a
veri

in
a
discus

of
scienc
except
a
a
propos
definien
extrar
is
a
better
phrase
in
fact
there
are
quit
a
number
of
wellknown
case
of
extrar
consider

scienc
in

yeah
but
the
problem
with
hold
up
the
extrar
exampl
a
exemplar
or
a
refut
of
well
found
methodolog
is
that
you
run
smack
up

such
unus
direct
a
lysenko
such
extra
ration
case
are
curio
not
guid
to
methodolog
a
ha
been
note
befor
there
is
the
distinct
between
motiv
and
method
no
experiment
result
should
be
accept
unless
it
is
describ
in
suffici
detail
to
be
replic
and
the
replic
do
inde
reproduc
the
result
no
theoret
argument
should
be
accept
unless
it
is
present
in
suffici
detail
to
be
follow
and
reason
knowleg

peopl
tri
experi
and

for
all
sort

crazi
reason
irrat
motiv
are
not
just
curious
they
are
a
larg
part

histori

there
are
a
coupl

a

exampl
quark
are
an
accept
part
of
the
standard
model
of
physic
with
no
direct
verif
what
would
be
need
would
be
a
theori
base
on
qi
that
predict

better

lie

a
long

there
wa
a
suffici
bodi
of

that
the
qi
theori
predict
better
than

other
i
wouldnt
hold
my
breath
wait
for
the
triumph
of
qi
though
i
dont
think
that
there
is
even
a
coher
theori
base
on
it
much
le
a
theori
that
explain
anyth
at
all
better
than
modern

and
it
is
hard
to
imagin
a

that
would
not
