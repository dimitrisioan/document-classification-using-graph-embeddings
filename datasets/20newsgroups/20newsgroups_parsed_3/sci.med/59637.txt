pretti
much
onc
a
month
most
of
the
time

well
with

i
know

pretti
familiar
i
post
similar
cri
about
last
septemb
when
carolin
just
enter
daycar
she
wa
two
then
and
have
been
with
continu
cold
sinc
until
last
march
a
spring
approach
her
cold
slow
down
meanwhil
we
grew
more
and
more
relax
about
her
cold
onli
onc
did
the
doctor
diagnos
an
ear
infect
and
onli
twice
she
had
antibiot
the
other
time
wa
due
to
sinu
infect
and
i
wish
that
i
did
not
give
her
that
aw
septra
are
there
ani
studi
that
can
help
answer
some
of
these
question
there
are
the
net
studi
that
is
if
you
read
thi
newsgroup
often
there
will
be
a
round
of
question
like
thi
everi
month
there
might
be
formal
studi
like
that
but
bear
with
my
not
so
academ
experi
okay
how
often
do
kid
in
their
first
second
and
third
year
fall
sick
how
often
do
they
get
cold
flu
ear
infect
gee
i
bet
youll
hear
case
in
all
these
catagori
is
there
ani
data
on
home
care
v
day
care
i
am
pretti
sure
an
insul
child
at
home
sick
le
but
that
child
still
will
face
the
world
one
day
doe
be
sick
build
immun
lead
to
le
ill
later
that
what
i
believ
and
comfort
myself
with
carolin
will
get
more
and
more
cold
for
sure
befor
she
learn
not
to
stick
her
hand
in
other
kid
mouth
nor
let
other
kid
do
the
same
cold
viru
mutat
easili
howev
i
hope
that
her
immun
system
will
be
stronger
to
fight
these
diseas
so
she
would
be
le
sever
affect
everytim
she
ha
a
cold
we
make
sure
she
blow
her
nose
frequent
and
give
her
dorcol
or
dimetapp
at
night
so
she
can
have
good
rest
thank
to
some
suggest
from
the
net
that
about
all
the
care
she
need
from
u
i
tri
veri
hard
to
keep
her
off
antibiot
twice
her
ped
gave
me
choic
to
decid
whether
she
would
have
antibiot
i
wait
just
long
enough
day
to
see
that
she
fought
the
ill
off
i
do
understand
that
you
dont
have
much
choic
if
the
child
is
in
pain
andor
high
fever
doe
it
make
kid
weaker
lead
to
more
ill
later
or
doe
it
not
have
ani
long
term
effect
if
the
child
doesnt
reli
on
antibiot
to
fight
off
the
sick
everytim
then
the
child
should
be
stronger
doe
take
antibiot
on
a
regular
basi
have
ani
neg
long
term
effect
ill
leav
thi
to
expert
how
doe
one
tell
if
a
child
is
more
suscept
to
ill
than
normal
and
what
doe
one
do
about
it
if
your
child
just
enter
daycar
im
pretti
sure
the
first
month
will
be
the
hardest
then
you
get
more
use
to
it
boy
do
i
hate
to
see
me
type
thi
sentenc
i
recal
when
i
read
someth
like
thi
last
septemb
i
said
to
myself
oh
sure
but
i
do
get
use
to
it
now
howev
i
do
hear
peopl
say
that
it
doe
get
better
after
a
year
or
two
i
am
look
forward
to
a
healthier
next
winter
a
it
get
warmer
i
hope
you
do
get
some
break
soon
is
there
ani
way
to
build
immun
and
resist
eat
well
sleep
well
tri
not
to
use
antibiot
