know
he
is
allerg
to

sting
but
that
hi
reaction

sever
local
swell
not

i
could
not
convinc

howev
becaus
that
not
written
in
their
littl
rule
book
of
cours
bee

chemic
could
be
your

is
react

compon
than
the
one
that
caus
anaphylact

in
other
peopl
hmmm
the
last
time
i
got
stung
by
a
bee
i
experienc
the
same
reaction
the
first
poster
brother
did
we
went
off
to
the
doctor
to
see
if
i
should
worri
about
the
fact
that
my
foot
wa
now
about
time
it
normal
size
and
itch
ow
he
basic
said
i
shouldnt
thi
time
but
that
bee
sting
allergi
wa
not
someth
you
tend
to
get
aclimat
to
but
were
someth
that
each
time
got
progress
wors
gener
and
that
next
time
could
be
the
time
i
go
into
anaphylact
shock
admittedli
thi
wa
mani
year
ago
when
i
wa
young
sinc
then
i
just
make
sure
i
dont
get
stung
i
also
should
carri
a
bee
sting
kit
with
me
but
i
dont
thi
isnt
scientif
or
proof
but
thi
would
lead
me
to
believ
it
not
a
differ
reaction
just
a
differ
degre
of
reaction
allergi
work
that
way
peopl
have
variou
reaction
sort
of
like
diabet
some
peopl
can
get
by
with
just
monitor
their
diet
other
have
to
monitor
their
diet
and
use
insulin
sometim
while
other
have
to
watch
their
diet
like
a
hawk
and
use
insulin
regularli
i
think
msg
is
probabl
similarsom
peopl
have
allerg
reaction
to

some
peopl
are
allerg
to
ferment
thing
and
cant
use
soy
saucebut
