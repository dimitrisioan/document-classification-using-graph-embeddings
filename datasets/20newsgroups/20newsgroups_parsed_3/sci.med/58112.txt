re
jigger
i
may
not
be
the
world
greatest
expert
on
chigger
a
type
of
mite
indigen
to
the
south
but
i
certainli
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
contempl
the
littl
bugger
over
the
past
six
year
sinc
we
move
to
nc
here
are
some
observ
gain
from
pain
experi
reaction
to
chigger
vari
greatli
from
person
to
person
some
peopl
get
tini
red
bite
other
like
me
are
more
sensit
and
get
fairli
larg
swollen
sorelik
affair
chigger
bite
are
the
gift
that
keep
on
give
i
swear
that
these
thing
will
itch
for
month
there
is
a
lot
of
folklor
about
chigger
i
think
most
of
it
is
fiction
i
have
tri
to
do
research
on
the
critter
sinc
they
have
such
an
effect
on
me
the
onli
book
i
could
find
on
the
subject
wa
a
singl
book
in
unc
special
collect
librari
i
have
not
yet
gone
through
what
is
requir
to
get
it
base
on
my
experi
and
that
of
my
famili
member
the
old
folk
remedi
of
fingernail
polish
simpli
doesnt
work
i
recal
read
that
the
theori
upon
which
it
is
base
that
the
chigger
burrow
into
your
skin
and
continu
to
parti
there
is
fals
i
think
it
is
more
like
that
the
reaction
is
to
toxin
of
some
sort
the
littl
pest
releas
but
thi
is
specul
the
best
approach
is
prevent
a
coupl
of
thing
work
well
a
good
insect
repel
deet
such
a
deep
wood
off
liber
appli
to
ankl
waistband
etc
is
a
good
start
there
is
anoth
prepar
call
chig
away
that
is
a
combin
of
sulfur
and
some
kind
of
cream
cortison
that
origin
wa
prepar
for
the
armi
and
is
not
commerci
avail
in
the
summer
i
put
thi
on
my
ankl
everi
morn
when
i
get
up
on
weekend
sinc
i
liter
cant
go
outsid
where
we
live
in
the
countri
without
seriou
consequ
they
appar
dont
like
sulfur
much
at
all
you
can
use
sulfur
a
a
dust
on
your
bodi
or
cloth
to
repel
them
no
amount
of
prevent
will
be
complet
success
forget
the
fingernail
polish
i
have
final
settl
upon
a
treatment
that
involv
topic
applic
of
a
combin
of
cortison
creme
reduc
the
inflam
and
swell
and
benzocain
relief
the
itch
i
wont
tell
you
all
the
thing
ive
tri
nor
will
i
tell
you
some
of
the
thing
my
wife
doe
sinc
thi
count
a
minor
surgeri
and
is
best
not
mention
i
also
think
it
gain
noth
the
swell
and
itch
can
also
be
significantli
reliev
by
the
applic
of
hot
pack
and
thi
seem
to
speed
recoveri
a
well
doctor
seem
not
to
care
much
about
chigger
the
urban
and
suburban
doctor
appar
dont
encount
them
much
and
the
rural
doctor
seem
to
regard
them
a
a
forc
of
natur
that
one
must
endur
i
suspect
that
anyon
who
could
come
up
with
a
good
treatment
for
chigger
would
make
a
lot
of
