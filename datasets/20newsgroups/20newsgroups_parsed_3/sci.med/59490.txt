i
person
wouldnt
be
so
quick
and
take
that
nejm
articl
on
kidney

a
gospel
first
of
all
i
would
want
to
know
who
sponsor
that
studi
i
have
seen
too
mani
nutrit
bulletin
over
the

from
local

to

with
disclaim
on
the
bottom
inform
u
that
thi
great
health
news
wa
brought
to

compliment
of

there
are
of

that

were
all

the

ly
calcium
perhap
it
wont
be
long
befor
anoth
studi
come
up
with
the
exact
opposit
find
a
curiou
phenomenon
with
research
is
that
they
are
oftentim
just
plain
wrong
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
time
sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphoru
ratio
are
in
my
opinion
still
the
most
reliabl
indic
for
the
caus
treatment
and
prevent
of
kidney
stone
i
for
one
will
continu
to
recommend
the
most
logic
chang
in
one
diet
or
through
supplement
to
counteract
or
prevent
kidney
stone
of
either
type
and
they
definit
wont
includ
an
increas
in
calcium
if
the
stone
have
been
identifi
a
be
of
the
calcium
type
and
peopl
chemic
analysi
confirm
that
they
would
benefit
from
a
phosphorusrais
approach
instead

you
are
absolut
right
not
all
kidney
stone
have
calcium
and
not
all
calcium
stone
are
calciumoxal
but
the
vast
major
are
calcium
oxal
calcium
is
just
one
piec
of
the
puzzl
i
cite
that
nejm
articl
a
a
way
of
point
out
to
some
of
the
physician
in
thi
group
that
convent

is
use
in

alway
ha
been
and
probabl
alway
will
be
if
one
use
convent
wisdom
there
is
a
chanc
that
you
will
be
wrong
a
long
a
the
error
is
not
