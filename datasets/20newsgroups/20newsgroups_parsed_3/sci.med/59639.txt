accur

it
worth
the
it
is
current
sell
for
no
they
do
not
work
well
my
doctor
start
use
one
recent
and
i
thought
the
concept
wa
so
amaz
that
i
bought
one
too
the
thing
work
by
read
the
infrar
emiss
from
the
ear
drum
the
ear
drum
is
hotter
than
the
ear
canal
wall
so
you
have
to
point
the
thing
veri
care
thi
mean
tug
on
the
top
of
the
ear
to
straighten
out
the
ear
canal
then
insert
the
thing
snugli
then
push
a
button
unfortun
there
are
mani
thing
that
can
go
wrong
it
is
almost
imposs
to
aim
the
thing
correctli
when
you
do
it
on
yourself
i
get
read
which
differ
from
each
other
by
up
to
degre
and
may
differ
from
an
oral
thermomet
by
up
to
degre
i
talk
to
one
of
the
nurs
in
my
doctor
offic
recent
about
thi
and
she
said
she
didnt
like
them
either
for
same
reason
she
did
give
me
some
instruct
on
how
to
tug
on
my
ear
and
what
correct
insert
feel
like
but
she
said
she
thought
it
wa
imposs
to
do
correctli
on
one
self
she
also
said
that
she
and
other
nurs
had
complain
to
the
compani
about
inaccur
read
and
that
someon
from
the
compani
had
told
them
to
take
great
care
to
clean
the
infrar
window
at
the
end
of
the
probe
with
alcohol
from
time
to
time
she
demonstr
thi
prior
to
read
my
temperatur
and
manag
to
get
a
read
within
degre
of
the
oral
temperatur
i
took
at
home
befor
drive
to
the
dr
offic
i
have
also
notic
tha
some
nurs
click
the
button
then
remov
the
probe
immedi
thi
caus
wrong
read
in
my
experi
you
have
to
leav
the
probe
in
a
good
to
second
after
click
the
button
to
get
a
good
measur
the
nurs
i
talk
with
agre
i
suspect
that
mani
peopl
dont
realiz
thi
and
therefor
get
bad
read
for
yet
anoth
reason
in
short
it
a
great
idea
it
may
work
for
some
folk
but
i
believ
it
doesnt
work
well
for
a
person
who
want
to
take
hi
own
temperatur
