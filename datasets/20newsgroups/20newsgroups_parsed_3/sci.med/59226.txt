brian
man
delaney
wrote
one
thing
that
i
havent
seen
in
thi
thread
is
a
discuss
of
the
relat
between
ibd
inflamm
and
the
profil
of
ingest
fatti
acid
fa
i
wa
diagnos
last
may
wcrohn
of
the
termin
ileum
when
i
got
out
of
the
hospit
i
read
up
on
it
a
bit
and
came
across
sever
studi
investig
the
role
of
epa
an
essenti
fa
in
reduc
inflamm
the
evid
wa
mix
mani
of
these
studi
are
discuss
in
inflammatori
bowel
diseas
macdermott
stenson
but
if
i
recal
correctli
there
were
some
methodolog
bone
to
be
pick
with
the
studi
both
the
one
wpo
and
wneg
result
in
the
studi
patient
were
given
epa
a
few
gramsday
for
most
of
the
studi
but
if
i
recal
correctli
there
wa
no
restrict
of
the
other
fa
that
the
patient
could
consum
from
the
inform
layperson
perspect
thi
seem
mistaken
if
lot
of
n
fa
are
consum
along
with
the
epa
then
the
ratio
of
bad
prostanoid
product
to
good
prostanoid
product
could
still
be
fairli
bad
isnt
thi
ratio
the
issu
what
the
view
of
the
gastro
commun
on
epa
these
day
epa
supplement
along
with
a
fairli
sever
restrict
of
other
fa
appear
to
have
help
me
significantli
though
it
could
just
be
the
low
absolut
amount
of
fat
i
eat
calori
brian
a
you
note
the
research
is
mix
so
there
is
no
consensu
on
the
role
of
fatti
acid
in
ulcer
coliti
there
is
a
role
for
short
chain
fatti
acid
in
patient
with
colostomi
and
rectal
pouch
that
are
inflam
short
is
butyr
and
shorter
there
may
be
a
role
for
treatment
of
uc
with
short
chain
fatti
acid
and
i
am
look
forward
to
the
upcom
aga
meet
in
boston
to
see
what
peopl
are
do
you
rais
a
hypothesi
about
the
studi
and
restrict
of
other
fatti
acid
you
should
contact
the
author
directli
about
that
or
even
write
a
letter
to
the
editor
it
is
a
good
point
by
the
way
the
abbrevi
epa
is
not
in
gener
use
so
i
do
not
know
what
fatti
acid
you
are
speak
about
and
to
brian
an
u
of
c
there
is
a
physician
name
stephen
hanauer
there
who
is
a
recogn
expert
in
the
treatment
of
ibd
you
might
give
him
a
call
he
is
interest
in
new
combin
of
drug
for
the
treatment
of
ibd
if
you
call
pleas
say
hello
to
him
from
me
i
wa
look
at
u
of
c
for
a
posit
and
perhap
still
am
and
be
sure
to
look
into
join
the
