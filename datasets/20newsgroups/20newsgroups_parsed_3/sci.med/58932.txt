accept
a
a
method
of

least
alleiat
mani
condit
to
which
modern

ha
no
answer
in
most
of
these

by
whom
not
by
scientist
there
are
peopl
in
everi

and
money
on

britain
and
scandanavia
where
i

of
these
countri

dont
believ

for
homeopath
treatment
in
germani

do
so
a
well
i
austria
they
do
if
you
have
a
condit
which
can
not
be
help
by
normal
medicin

to
be
the

i
found
that
in
combin
with
acupunctur
it
chang
my
life
from
live
hell
to
a
condit
which
enabl
me
to
lead
a
rel
normal
life
i
found
that
modern
medicin
wa
powerless
to
cure
me
of
a
sever
case
of
neuroderm
note
i
mean
cure
not
surpress
the
symptom
which
is
what
modern
medicin
attempt
to
do
in
the
case
of
neuroderm
im
not
say
that
homeopathi
is
scientif
but
that
it
can
offer
help
in
area
in
which
modern
medicin
is
absolut
helpless
from
read
your
aritcl
it
seem
that
your
have
some
deepli
root
belief
about
thi
issu
thi
is
not
intend
to
be
offens
or
sarcast
it
just
sound
like
that
to
me
which
make
me
doubt
if
you
