write
in

write
my
biggest
resent
is
the
doctor
who
make
it
seem
like
most
peopl
with
dizzi
can
be
cure
that
definit
not
the
case
in
most
case
like
i
said
abov
it
is
a
long
tediou
process
that
may
or
may
not
end
up
in
a
partial
cure
be
sure
to
say
chronic
dizzi
not
just
dizzi
most
patient
with
acut
or
subacut
dizzi
will
get
better
the
vertigin
spell
of
menier
will
also
eventu
go
away
howev
the
patient
is
left
with
a
deaf
ear
all
true
and
all
good
point
to
anyon
suffer
with
vertigo
dizzi
or
ani
variat
thereof
my
best
advic
to
you
a
a
fellowsuffer
is
thi
just
keep
searchingdont
let
the
doctor
tell
you
there
noth
that
can
be
donedo
your
own
researchand
let
your
thi
may
have
help
you
but
im
not
sure
it
is
good
gener
advic
the
odd
that
you
are
go
to
find
some
miracl
with
your
own
research
that
is
secret
or
hidden
from
gener
knowledg
for
thi
or
ani
other
diseas
are
slim
when
good
answer
to
these
then
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energi
on
the
medic
problem
may
divert
that
energi
from
more
product
thing
in
life
a
limit
amount
should
be
spent
to
assur
yourself
that
your
doctor
gave
you
the
correct
stori
but
after
it
becom
clear
that
you
are
deal
with
a
problem
for
which
medicin
ha
no
good
solut
perhap
the
best
strategi
is
to
join
the
support
group
and
keep
abreast
of
new
find
but
not
to
make
a
career
out
of
it
well
make
a
career
out
of
it
is
a
bit
strong
i
still
believ
that
do
your
own
research
is
veri
veri
necessari
i
would
not
have
progress
a
much
a
i
have
today
unless
i
had
spent
the
mani
hour
in
stanford
med
librari
a
i
have
done
and
year
ago
it
wa
clear
that
there
wa
no
medicin
that
would
help
me
so
should
i
have
stop
search
thank
good
i
didnt
now
i
found
that
there
is
inde
medicin
that
help
me
i
think
that
what
youv
said
is
kind
of
idealist
that
you
would
go
to
one
doctor
get
a
diagnosi
mayb
get
a
second
opinion
and
then
move
on
with
your
life
just
a
an
exampl
have
seen
of
the
top
specialist
in
thi
field
in
the
countri
i
have
receiv
differ
diagnos
these
are
the
top
name
the
one
that
peopl
come
to
from
all
over
the
countri
i
have
had
to
sort
all
of
thi
out
myself
go
to
a
support
group
and
in
fact
head
that
support
group
wa
help
for
a
while
but
after
a
point
i
found
it
veri
unproduct
it
wa
much
more
product
to
do
librari
research
make
phone
call
and
put
togeth
the
piec
of
the
puzzl
myself
a
recent
movi
lorenzo

offer
a
perfect
exampl
of
what
im
talk
about
if
you
havent
seen
it
you
should
it
not
a
put
down
of
doctor
and
neither
is
what
im
say
doctor
are
onli
human
and
can
onli
do
so
much
but
there
are
those
of
u
out
here
who
are
intellig
and
abl
to
sometim
find
a
miss
piec
of
the
puzzl
that
might
have
otherwis
gone
unnot
i
guess
im
bias
becaus
dizzi
is
one
of
those
weird
thing
that
is
still
so
unknown
if
i
had
a
broken
arm
or
a
weak
heart
or
fail
kidney
i
might
not
have
the
same
opinion
that
becaus
those
thing
are
much
more
tangibl
and
have
much
more
concis
definit
and
treatment
with
dizzi
you
just
have
to
decid
to
live
with
it
or
decid
to
live
with
it
while

find
your
way
