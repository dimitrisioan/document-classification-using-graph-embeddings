primarili
caus
by
diet
a
is
heart
diseas
and
cancer
when
i
give
dietari
advis
it
is
not
intend
to
encourag
peopl
read
thi
news
groupor
sci
med
nutrit
where
i
do
most
of
my
post
to
avoid
see
a
doctor
noth
can
be
further
from
the
truth
kidney
stone
can
be
caus
by
tumor
and
thi
possibl
ha
to
be
rule
out
but
onc
it
is
diet
is
a
good
way
of
prevent
a
reoccur
same
thing
with
heart
diseas
and
cancer
if
you
suspect
that
you
may
have
a
problem
with
one
of
these
diseas
dont
use
what
im
go
to
tell
you
or
what
you
read
in
some
book
to
avoid
go
to
a
doctor
you
have
to
go
hope
you
will
find
a
doctor
who
know
enough
about
nutrit
to
help
you
chang
your
risk
factor
for
both
diseas
a
part
of
a
treatment
programbut
the
odd
are
that
you
will
not
and
that
whi
im
here
when
my
wife
detect
a
lump
in
here
breast
i
didnt
say
dont
worri
my
vitamin
e
will
take
care
of
it
ani
breast
lump
ha
to
be
work
up
by
a
physician
plan
and
simpl
if
it
begninwhich
most
are
fine
then
mayb
a
diet
chang
and
supplement
will
prevent
further
breast
lump
from
occur
but
let
me
tell
you
right
now
if
you
have
tri
diet
and
supplement
and
anoth
lump
return
get
your
butt
into
the
doctor
offic
a
fast
a
your
littl
foot
can
carri
youbett
yet
have
a
mammographi
done
on
a
regular
basi
my
wife
kept
put
her
off
both
myself
and
her
gynocologist
told
her
she
need
to
have
one
done
her
gynocologist
even
schedul
one
but
she
didnt
show
uptoo
busi
run
the
oper
room
for
the
biggest
hospit
in
tulsa
one
more
thing
i
am
not
an
orthomolecular
nutritionist
thi
group
us
high
dose
vitamin
and
miner
to
treat
all
kind
of
diseas
there
is
absolut
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
vitamin
and
miner
can
and
do
have
drug
action
in
the
bodi
but
you
talk
about
fli
blind
man
thi
is
realli
blind
treatment
no
drug
could
ever
be
use
a
these
vitamin
and
miner
are
be
use
im
not
say
that
some
of
thi
stuff
couldnt
be
right
on
the
money
it
may
well
be
but
my
approach
to
nutrit
is
a
lot
like
that
of
weinsier
and
morgan
the
two
md
who
wrote
the
new
clinic
nutrit
textbook
my
push
is
the
nutrient
reserv
and
the
lab
test
need
to
measur
these
reserv
and
then
supplement
or
diet
chang
to
get
these
reserv
built
up
to
where
they
should
be
to
let
you
handl
stress
that
where
im
come
from
folk
blast
away
if
you
want
im
not
go
to
chang
put
me
in
your
killfil
if
you
want
i
realli
dont
care
im
averag
email
messag
a
day
from
peopl
who
think
that
ive
got
someth
import
to
say
but
im
also
get
hit
by
a
few
with
an
axe
to
grind
that
life
chromium
is
one
of
the
trace
element
it
ha
a
veri
limitedbut
veri
import
role
in
the
bodi
it
is
use
to
form
glucos
toler
factor
gtf
gtf
is
made
up
of
chromium
nicinamideniacin
glycin
cystein
and
glutam
onli
the
chromium
and
the
niacin
are
need
from
the
diet
to
form
gtf
some
food
alreadi
have
gtfliver
brewer
or
nutrit
yeast
and
black
pepper
when
chromium
is
in
gtf
a
pretti
good
absorpt
is
seenabout
but
when
it
is
simpli
present
a
a
miner
or
miner
chelatechromium
picolin
it
absorpt
is
much
lower
to
lowest
for
all
the
miner
ive
been
post
in
misc
fit
and
chromium
ha
come
up
there
sever
time
a
a
fat
burner
chromium
is
among
the
least
toxic
of
the
miner
so
you
could
realli
load
yourself
up
and
not
realli
do
ani
harm
i
wouldnt
do
it
though
the
adequ
and
safe
rang
for
chromium
is
to
ug
per
day
the
averag
american
is
get
about
ug
per
day
from
hisher
diet
chromium
level
decreas
with
age
and
mani
believ
that
adult
onset
diabet
is
primarili
a
chromium
defici
i
can
cite
you
sever
studi
that
have
been
done
with
glucos
toler
in
type
ii
diabet
but
im
not
go
to
becaus
for
each
posit
one
there
also
seem
to
be
a
neg
one
a
well
im
convinc
that
the
problem
is
bioavail
when
yeastgtf
is
use
good
result
are
obtain
but
when
chromium
itself
is
use
the
result
are
usual
neg
in
addit

diabet
chromiuum
ha
been
examin
in

with
mix
result
a
far
a

is
concern
sinc
a
high
blood
glucos
level
can
lead
to
cardiovascular
diseas
thi
possibl
link
with
chromium
isnt
too
surpris

thi

preliminari

should
not
prompt
peopl
to
go
out
and
start
pop
chromium

for

thing
just
about
everi

is
go

they
have

suppleemntsyeast
sinc
glucoma
is
often
found
in
older
peopl
it
not
too
surpris
that
chromium
wa
low
in
the
rbc
if
chromium
supplement
could
revers
glucoma
that
would
prompt
some
attent
i
suspect
that
there
will
be
a
clinic
trail
to
check
out
thi
possibl
chromium
link
to
glucoma
you
could
find
out
what
your
bodi
chromium
pool
size
wa
by
either
the
rbc
chromium
test
or
hair
analysi
most
clinic
lab
are
not
go
to
run
a
rbc
chromium
there
are
plenti
of
lab
that
will
do
a
hair
and
nail
analysi
for
you
but
i
wouldnt
use
them
there
is
just
too
much
funni
busi
go
on
in
these
unregul
lab
right
now
here
weinsier
and
morgan
advis
on
chromium
they
do
not
consid
chromium
to
be
one
of
those
miner
for
which
a
reliabl
clinic
test
is
availablethey
dont
like
the
hair
and
nail
analysi
lab
either
and
they
also
recogn
the
rbc
chromium
is
primarili
a
research
test
that
is
not
routin
avail
in
most
clinic
chemistri
lab
thi
ha
to
chang
and
a
more
lab
run
a
rbc
chromiuum
it
will
what
then
do
they
suggest
make
a
diagnosi
of
chromium
defici
base
on
a
document
clinic
respons
to
chromiumrun
a
glucos
toler
test
befor
and
after
chromium
supplement
onc
you
make
the
diagnosi
put
the
patient
on
ug
of
crcl
oral
each
day
or
gram
of
yeast
per
day
what
my
advis
dont
take
chromium
supplement
to
tri
to
loos
weight
they
just
do
not
work
that
way
if
you
want
to
take
them
and
then
exercis
that
would
be
great
do
includ
yeast
a
part
of
your
dietmost
american
are
not
get
enough
chromium
from
their
diet
if
you
do
have
a
poor
glucos
toler
ask
your
doctor
to
check
your
chromium
statu
when
he
or
she
say
what
in
the
world
are
you
talk
about
just
say
pleas
get
a
copi
of
weinsier
and
morgan
new
clinic
nutrit
textbook
and
do
what
they
say
to
do
with
patient
who
present
with
