that

thi
a
a

profess
it
is
an
aspect
of
hospit
that
is
veri
frighten
to
me
doc
seem
to
believ
that
becaus
they
have
close
control
of
you
it
quit
all
right
to
take
your
bodili
equilibrium
into
their
own
hand
that
control
reduc
the
chanc
that
the
patient
will
make
a
mistak
but
health
care
provid
can
make
mistak
too
and
mistak
can
be
deadli
under
those
circumst
i
grant
you
that
sometim
there
no
choic
nevertheless
i
suggest
you
procur
a
list
of

discu
