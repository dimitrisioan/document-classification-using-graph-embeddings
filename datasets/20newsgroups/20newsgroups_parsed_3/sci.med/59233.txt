write
i
recal
read
somewher
dure
my
youth
in
some
scienc
popular
book
that
whyle
isotop
chang
dont
normal
affect
chemistri
a
consumpt
of
onli
heavi
water
would
be
fatal
and
that
seed
water
onli
with
heavi
water
do
not
sprout
doe
anyon
know
about
thi
i
also
heard
thi
i
alway
thought
it
might
make
a
good
eposid
of
columbo
for
someon
to
be
poison
with
heavi
water
it
wouldnt
show
up
in
ani
chemic
test
no
one
el
seem
to
know
so
ill
post
thi
thi
topic
came
up
on
sciphysicsfus
shortli
after
the
coldfus
flap
start
a
i
recal
it
been
done
to
some
experiment
mouse
they
show
variou
ill
effect
and
eventu
die
the
reason
is
that
deuterium
doe
not
have
exactli
the
same
reaction
rate
a
hydrogen
due
to
it
extra
mass
which
caus
lower
veloc
boltzman
constant
mumbl
thi
throw
variou
bit
of
bodi
biochemistri
out
of
kilter
and
you
get
sick
and
die
ive
never
heard
of
anyon
be
poisen
thi
way
in
or
out
of
real
life
the
process
take
quit
a
while
if
anyon
want
to
write
thi
book
i
would
imagin
you
would
have
to
replac
a
signific
fraction
of
the
water
in
the
bodi
with
heavi
water
wait
while
normal
breakdown
and
repair
process
caus
other
molecul
in
the
bodi
to
be
synthesis
use
the
deuterium
dure
thi
process
the
victim
would
gradual
deterior
and
eventu
die
but
i
imagin
it
would
take
week
dure
which
the
poison
would
have
to
ensur
that
a
signific
proport
of
the
water
the
victim
ingest
wa
heavi
you
would
get
such
a
mess
of
symptom
that
the
doctor
would
be
both
alarm
and
confus
whi
should
everi
organ
in
the
bodi
suddenli
begin
to
deterior
if
you
can
figur
out
how
the
poison
get
the
heavi
water
into
the
victim
in
a
hospit
then
you
could
have
a
real
stori
here
come
to
think
of
it
would
continu
even
after
the
heavi
water
wa
no
longer
be
ingest
so
hospitalis
might
be
too
late
the
most
detect
effect
would
be
that
the
victim
bodi
fluid
would
liter
be
heavi
water
ha
a
molecular
weight
of
and
heavi
water
ha
a
mw
of
thu
the
victim
weight
will
increas
by
about
for
everi
of
bodi
water
replac
by
heavi
water
mayb
the
detect
occur
becaus
some
pathologist
in
the
lab
notic
that
the
victim
urin
is
strang
den
is
there
ani

involv

specif

of
a
