i
must
also
add
that
i

an
oper
a
few

endometriosi
and
ive

problem
with
endometriosi
but
appar
it
is
caus
me
pain
in
my
pelvic
region
dure
the
pregnanc
and
i
have
a
veri
difficult
time
move
and
the
doc
ha
recommend
i
not
walk
or
move
unless
i
have
to
i
have
a
littl
handicap
sticker
for
when
i
do
need
to
go
out
anyway
that
of
the
situat
the
other
is
that
almost
from
the
begin
of
pregnanc
i
wa
get
sick
throw
up
about
time
a
day
and
mostli
it
wa
bile
that
wa
be
elimin
i
told
her
about
thi
i
know
thi
becaus
i
wasnt
eat
veri
much
due
to
the
nausea
and
could
see
the
result
well
now
i
onli
get
sick
about
onc
everi
week
and
it
is
still
bile
relat
but
in
addit
i
had
begun
to
feel
movement
near
my
upper
right
abdomen
just
below
the
right
breast
usual
when
i
wa
lie
on
my
right
side
it
began
to
get
wors
though
becaus
it
start
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
posit
i
wa
in
next
i
notic
that
when
i
ate
greasi
or
fatti
food
i
felt
like
my
entir
abdomen
had
turn
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
wors
howev
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
someth
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
a
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
say
i
have
cholistati
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatti
food
thi
make
sen
and
becaus
i
wa
alreadi
awar
of
what
seem
to
me
thi
caus
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoid
these
food
on
my
own
but
im
still
abl
to
eat
food
with
ricotta
chees
for
instanc
and
other
low
fat
food
but
doc
want
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
thi
mean
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
thi
anyway
no
nut
fri
food
chees
etc
i
am
allow
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anyth
sweet
eg
banana
also
i
must
onli
have
one
serv
of
someth
high
in
carbohydr
a
day
potato
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
veget
in
a
littl
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
veget
raw
or
steam
im
concern
becaus
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digest
process
and
if
im
not
take
in
fat
is
she
expect
the
babi
will
take
it
from
my
store
and
whi
thi
restrict
on
carbohydr
if
she
concern
about
fat
im
not
clear
how
much
of
her
recommend
is
base
on
my
weight
gain
and
how
much
on
cholistati
which
i
cant
seem
to
find
ani
inform
on
she
origin
said
that
i
should
onli
gain
pound
dure
the
entir
pregnanc
sinc
i
wa
about
lb
overweight
when
i
start
but
my
sister
gain
lb
dure
her
pregnanc
and
she
taken
it
all
off
and
hasnt
had
ani
problem
she
also
ask
if
ani
member
of
my
famili
were
obes
which
none
of
them
are
anyway
i
think
she
is
overli
concern
about
weight
gain
and
feel
like
im
be
punish
by
a
sever
diet
she
did
want
to
see
me
again
in
one
week
so
i
think
she
the
diet
may
be
temporari
for
that
one
week
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
reason
is
thi
nonfat
diet
i
would
understand
if
she
had
said
lowfat
diet
sinc
im
tri
that
anyway
even
if
she
said
realli
lowfat
diet
i
think
she
assum
i
must
be
eat
a
highfat
diet
but
realli
it
is
that
becaus
of
the
endometriosi
and
the
oper
im
not
abl
to
use
the
energi
from
the
food
