steve
claim
a
for
one
i
am
not
a
doctor
and
i
agre
that
food
dont
bring
on
the
recurr
of
crohn
but
inflamm
can
be
either
mildli
or
drastic
enhanc
due
to
food
the
feel
obout
thi
ha
chang
in
the
gi
commun
the
current
feel
is
that
inflamm
is
not
induc
by
food
there
is
even
evid
that
patient
depriv
of
food
have
mucos
atrophi
due
to
lack
of
stimul
of
intestin
growth
factor
there
is
now
interest
in
provid
small
amount
of
nasogastr
feed
to
patient
on
iv
nutrit
but
i
digress
symptom
can
be
drastic
enhanc
by
food
but
not
inflamm
have
had
one
major
obstruct
result
in
resect
is
that
a
good
enough
caveat
i
wa
told
that
a
low
residu
diet
is
call
for
basic
the
idea
is
that
if
there
is
inflamm
of
the
gut
which
may
not
be
realiz
by
the
patient
ani
residu
in
the
system
can
be
caught
in
the
fold
of
inflamm
and
constantli
irrit
thu
exacerb
the
problem
therefor
anyth
that
doesnt
digest
complet
by
the
point
of
common
inflamm
should
be
avoid
