thi
is
my
first
post
and
i
am
not
even
sure
it
will
work
here
goe
did
anyon
read
the
editori
on
page
in
the
march
edit
of
time
magazin
note
that
manag
care
is
extrem
ineffici
of
all
the
possibl
client
that
billari
could
be
pander
to
the
insur
industri
is
the
worst
comment
i
agre
ad
layer
of
manag
and
bureaucrat
simpli
eat
up
money
that
could
be
spent
on
those
who
actual
are
do
the
work
such
a
doctor
and
nurs
and
suppli
the
most
effici
system
is
probabl
one
that
ha
limit
manag
and
a
fix
budget
such
a
england
or
even
canada
im
afraid
we
are
on
the
wrong
track
the
problem
may
be

surrend
it
too
soon
