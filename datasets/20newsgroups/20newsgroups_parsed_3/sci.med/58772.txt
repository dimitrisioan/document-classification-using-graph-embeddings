it
work
great
gordon
bank
a
lot
to
keep
from
go
back
to
morbid
obes
i
think
all
of
u
cycl
one
success
depend
on
how
larg
the
fluctuat
in
the
cycl
are
some
peopl
can
cycl
onli
pound
unfortun
im
not
one
of
them
thi
certainli
describ
my
situat
perfectli
for
me
there
is
a
constant
dynam
between
my
tendenc
to
eat
which
appear
to
be
total
limitless
and
the
pure
consciou
desir
to
not
put
on
too
much
weight
when
i
get
too
fat
i
just
dietexercis
more
with
vari
degre
of
success
to
take
off
the
extra
weight
usual
i
cycl
within
a
lb
rang
but
smaller
and
larger
cycl
occur
a
well
im
alway
afraid
that
thi
method
will
stop
work
someday
but
usual
i
seem
to
be
abl
to
hold
the
weight
gain
in
check
thi
is
one
reason
i
have
a
hard
time
accept
the
notion
of
some
metabol
derang
associ
with
cycl
diet
that
result
in
longterm
weight
gain
i
have
been
cycl
diet
for
at
least
year
without
see
such
a
chang
i
think
a
vigor
exercis
program
can
go
a
long
way
toward
keep
the
cycl
smaller
and
the
baselin
weight
low
