do
you
have
a
problem
with
the

becaus
they
use
yogurt
rather

even
though
it

david
thi

inform
thi
is
often
the
reason
whi
lactobacillu
acidophilu
tablet

rather
than

i
guess
the
next
question
is
whi
would
thi
introduct
of

back

decreas
the

fact

gordon
r
vehementi
deni
i
see
two
possibl
theori
one
the
l
acidophilu
which
is
a
facult
anaerob
bacterium
could
make
it
through
the
gut
and
colon
the
rectal
area
to
overgrow
the
candida
thi
would
not
explain
the
reoccur
of
candida
bloom
in
the
vagina
after
the
yogurt
ingest
wa
stop
though
the
other
is
that
the
addit
bacteria
in
the
intestin
tract
remov
most
of
the
glucos
from
the
fece
and
candida
loo
it
major
food
sourc
get
lactobacillu
acidophilu
to
colon
the
vagin
tractwher
it
is
normal
found
would
have
a
much
better
effect
on
the
recurr
of
vagin
yeast
bloom
though
an
acet
acid
lactobacillu
acidophilu
douch
ha
been
use
to
get
thi
effect
but
ive
not
seen
ani
such
treatment
report
in
the
medic
literatur
thi
would
be
an
exampl
of
physician
conduct
their
own
clinic
trial
to
tri
to
come
up
with
treatment
that
help
their
patient
when
thi
is
done
in
privat
practic
the
result
are
rare
if
ever
publish
it
wa
the
hallmark
of
medicin
until
the
modern
age
emerg
with
clinic
trial
it
realli
rais
a
big
question
doe
the
medic
profess
cast
out
the
adventer
few
who
tri
new
treatment
to
help
patient
or
doe
it
look
the
other
way
thi

simpl

the
antifung
are
not
all
that
danger
but
there
are
some
areaslik
edta

where
the

could

it
realli
tough
do
i
follow

well
establish
protocol
and
then
give
up
if
they
dont
work
that
well
or
do
it
tri
someth
that
look
like
it
will
work
but
hasnt
been
proven
to
work
yet
my
stand
is
to
consid
other
treatment
possibl
especi
if
they
involv
littl
or
no
risk
to
the
patient
get
good
bacteria

treatment
possibl
