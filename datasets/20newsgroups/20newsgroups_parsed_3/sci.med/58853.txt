of

and
piec

some
leav
a
hole
that

some
are
trivial
in

it
is
a
grave
mistak
to
confus
these
past

from

i
doubt
if

these
are
not
the

accord
to

who
post

accord
to

if

then
it
not
scienc
these

are
make
the
mistak
that
i
have
previous
critic
of
adher
to
a

recip
a
care
design
and
control
studi
is
neither
alway
possibl
nor
alway
import
on
the
other
hand
if
someon
is
propos
a
remedi
that
supposedli
allevi
a
chronic
medic
problem
we
have
enough
knowledg
of
the
error
that
have
plagu
thi
kind
of
claim
to
ask
for
a
care
design
and
control
studi
to
allevi
our
skeptic
rule
such
a
support
the
hypothesi
by
a
care
design
and
control
studi
are
too
narrow
to
appli
to
all
investig
i
think
that
the
requir
for
particular
reason
to
be
convinc
depend
greatli
on
the
kind
of
mistak
that
have
occur
in
