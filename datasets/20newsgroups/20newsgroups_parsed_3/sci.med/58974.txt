dan
hartung
write
just
had
the
opportun
to
watch
thi
flick
on
ae
some
year
sinc
i
saw
it
last
wow
the
wwii
channel
did
someth
notwwii
i
wa
veri
interest
in
the
technolog
demonstr
in
thi
film
for
handl
infecti
diseas
and
similar
toxic
substanc
clearli
they
fake
a
lot
of
the
comput
robot
technolog
certainli
at
the
time
it
wa
made
most
of
that
wa
scienc
fiction
itself
let
alon
the
idea
of
a
space
germ
the
graphic
capabl
of
the
comput
were
veri
fake
for
movi
audienc
who
have
not
abil
or
patienc
with
number
the
book
wa
more
realist
in
that
respect
in
all
respect
actual
the
robot
are
still
out
of
rang
but
not
imposs
quit
coincident
actual
thi
is
what
got
me
want
to
see
the
movi
again
i
watch
a
segment
on
the
otherwis
aw
howd
they
do
that
deal
with
a
diseas
research
at
the
cdc
top
lab
there
wa
descript
of
the
elabor
secur
measur
taken
so
that
build
will
never
be
crack
so
to
speak
by
man
or
natur
short
of
deliber
bomb
from
the
air
perhap
and
the
research
use
spacesuit
similar
to
that
in
the
film
sf
and
ive
alway
wonder
how
crichton
escap
thi
classif
is
usual
ahead
of
scienc
in
both
predict
and
precaut
nasa
decontaimin
process
were
supposedli
taken
to
prevent
sf
stori
disast
i
mean
nasa
scientist
were
often
sf
reader
and
sometim
writer
and
felt
prewarn
by
their
read
im
curiou
what
peopl
think
about
thi
film
short
of
silli
is
such
a
facil
technic
feasibl
today
i
think
the
film
still
hold
up
among
the
best
of
sf
film
but
that
isnt
say
a
whole
lot
a
far
a
the
plot
and
the
crystallin
structur
that
is
not
life
a
we
know
it
that
a
whole
nother
argument
for
recartssftech
or
someth
yep
