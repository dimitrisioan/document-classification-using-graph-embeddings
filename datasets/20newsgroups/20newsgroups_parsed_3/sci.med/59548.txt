robert
im
so
glad
that
you
post
your
biolog
alchemi
discus
ive
been
compar
to
the
famou
robert
mcelwain
by
some
reader
of
sci
med
i
didnt
know
how
to
respond
sinc
i
had
not
seen
one
of
your
postsjust
like
i
havent
read
the
yeast
connect
let
me
just
start
by
state
that
the
author
of
the
cold
fusion
paper
of
recent
year
are
now
in
scientif
exilei
believ
that
one
ha
actual
left
the
countri
scientif
fraud
is
rare
im
still
not
sure
that
if
a
review
of
the
research
note
of
the
cold
fusion
scientist
actual
prove
fraud
or
just
veri
shoddi
experiment
your
sourc
do
not
seem
to
be
research
articl
they
are
more
like
lay
text
design
to
piqu
human

robert
i
tri
to
keep
an
open
mind
but
some
thing
i
just
cant
buyon
is
take
sod
oral
to
prevent
oxid
damag
in
the
bodi
your
experi
if
conduct
by
reader
of
thi
news
group
would
prove
that
you
are
rightmor
ash
after
seed
sprout
than
befor
unless
you
use
a
muffl
furnanc
and
obtain
a
veri
high
temperatureabov
degre
i
believ
you
will
get
organ
residu
in
the
ash
even
the
residu
in
commerci
inciner
contain
organ
residu
i
rememb
do
thi
kind
of
experi
in
my
organ
chemistri
couurs
in
colleg
but
i
couldnt
find
a
temperatur
for
miner
ash
format
so
im
realli
guess
at
degre
f
it
may
actual
be
much
higher
the
point
is
that
no
one
in
their
home
could
ever
get
a
high
enough
temperatur
to
produc
onli
a
miner
ash
they
also
could
not
measur
the
miner
so
they
could
onli
weigh
the
ash
and
find
out
that
you
appear
to
be
correct
chemic
reaction
abound
in
our
bodi
in
our
atmospher
in
our
water
and
in
our
soil
are
these
fusion
reaction
ye
mani
of
them
do
involv
fuse
oxygen
nitrogen
and
sulfur
to
both
organ
and
inorgan
do
we
realli
have
the
transform
of
silicon
to
calcium
if
carbon
is
fuse
with
silicon
not
in
my
book
robert
silicon
is
the
most
abund
miner
on
our
planet
ive
seen
specul
that
man
could
have
evolv
to
be
a
silicon
base
rather
than
a
carbon
base
lifeform
i
like
read
scienc
fiction
a
mani
peopl
do
but
i
know
enough
about
biochemistryand
nutrit
to
be
ablein
most
case
to
separ
the
fiction
from
the
fact
silicon
may
be
one
of
the
trace
element
that
turn
out
to
be
essenti
in
human
we
have
sever
gram
of
the
stuff
in
our
bodi
what
it
do
there
onli
the
lord
know
right
now
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
do
know
about
silicon
and
whi
a
you
state
it
help
bone
healingand
it
is
not
becaus
silicon
is
transform
into
calcium
almost
all
of
the
silicon
in
the
human
bodi
is
found
in
the
connect
tissuecollagen
and
elastin
there
have
been
studi
publish
which
show
that
the
veri
high
silicon
content
in
elastin
may
be
an
import
protect
factor
against
atherosclerosisth
higher
the
silicon
content
in
elastin
the
more
resist
the
elastin
is
to
a
an
agerel
loss
of
elast
which
may
play
a
role
in
the
increas
in
blood
pressur
that
is
often
seen
a
part
of
the
age
process
in
human
for
bone
fractur
heal
the
first
step
is
a
collagen
matrix
into
which
calcium
and
phosphat
are
pump
by
osteoblast
a
high
level
of
silicon
in
the
diet
seem
to
speed
up
thi
matrix
format
thi
first
step
in
the
bone
heal
process
seem
to
be
the
hardest
for
some
peopl
to
get
go
electriacl
current
have
been
use
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
matrix
form
cell
orient
in
the
right
direct
so
that
the
matrix
can
be
form
in
the
gapor
gap
between
the
end
of
the
broken
bone
a
vitamin
c
defici
by
slow
collagen
format
a
well
a
caus
the
prodcut
of
defect
collagen
doe
slow
down
both
bone
and
wound
heal
zinc
is
also
anoth
big
player
in
bone
and
wound
heal
and
so
is
siliconin
an
undetermin
role
that
most
like
invol
matrix
format
and
not
transform
of
silicon
to
calcium
for
you
to
take
thi
bone
heal
observ
and
use
it
a
proof
that
silicon
is
transform
into
calcium
is
an
interest
littl
trick
but
robert
i
have
the
same
problem
myself
when
i
read
the
lay
pressand
ye
even
some
scientif
paper
is
the
explan
reason
without
a
veri
good
scienc
knowledg
base
you
and
most
reader
of
thi
news
group
are
fli
blindyou
have
to
take
it
on
faith
becaus
you
dont
know
ani
better
if
the
explan
seem
to
make
sen
to
me
base
on
my
knowledg
base
im
inclin
to
consid
itthi
usual
mean
tri
to
find
other
sourc
that
come
to
the
same
conclus
if
the
idealik
a
candida
bloom
seem
to
make
sen
to
me
i
tend
to
pursu
it
a
long
a
ani
advic
that
im
go
to
give
isnt
go
to
realli
mess
somebodi
up
if
thi
make
u
kindr
soul
robert
then
i
guess
ill
have
to
live
with
that
label
for
the
physician
who
have
decid
to
read
my
respons
to
robert
interest
post
i
hope
that
you
saw
the
segment
on
the
pediatr
neurosurgeon
last
night
on
u
tv
i
cant
rememb
the
network
or
hi
namelik
mani
night
i
wa
on
my
comput
and
my
wife
wa
watch
tv
in
our
den
where
i
have
my
comput
setup
thi
neurosurgeon
take
kid
with
brain
tumor
that
everyon
el
ha
given
up
on
and
he
usesunconvent
treatmentshi
own
word
he
say
that
he
ha
a
success
rate
the
one
case
that
i
heard
him
discus
would
normal
use
radiationconvent
treatment
he
wa
go
to
go
in
and
cut
you
guy
complain
about
the
cost
of
the
antifung
what
do
you
think
the
cost
differ
between
radiat
treatment
and
surgeri
is
guy
im
go
to
ask
you
guy
one
more
time
whi
blast
a
physician
who
take
the
chronic
sinu
suffererlik
jon
and
the
chronic
gi

elain
and
tri
to
help
them
use
unconvent
treatment
treatment
which
do
not
result
in
deathlik
those
that
the
neurosurgeon
use
is
it
becaus
candida
bloom
are
not

while
brain

are
how
about

may
