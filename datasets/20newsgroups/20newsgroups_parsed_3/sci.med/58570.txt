is
the

dont

in
say
thi
i
am
agre
with
the
work
of
peopl
like
kuhn
feyerabend
and

can
not
be

the

togeth
with
the

methodolog
for
new

of

is
what
drive
the
evolut
of
methodolog
and
how
we
think
about
them
a
usual
you
are
miss
the
whole
point
russel
becaus
you
are
not
will
to
even
consid
question
your
basic
articl
of
faith
which
is
that
scienc
is
mere
a
matter
of
methodolog
and
that
the
highest
purpos
of
scienc
is
to
avoid
make
mistak
thi
is
like
say
that
the
most
import
aspect
of
busi
manag
is
accur
bookkeep
if
scienc
were
no
more
than
methodolog
and
not
make
mistak
it
would
be
a
poor
thing
inde
what
wa
the
methodolog
of
darwin
what
wa
the
methodolog
of
einstein
what
wa
for
that
matter
the
methodolog
of
jenner
and
pasteur
in
an
earlier
articl
russel
turpin
write
none
of
the
forego
should
be
read
a
mean
that
we
should
open
the
door
to
practition
of
quackeri
and
psuedosci
modern
advoc
of
homeopathi
chiropracti
and
tradit
chine
medicin
receiv
littl
respect
becaus
for
the
most
part
they
use
method
and
reason
that
the
kind
of
research
lee
ladi
recommend
ha
shown
to
be
terribl
faulti
thi
doe
not
impli
that
all
their
treatment
are
ineffect
it
doe
impli
that
those
who
reli
on
faulti
methodolog
and
reason
are
incap
of
discov
which
treatment
are
effect
and
which
are
not
first
of
all
i
think
you
are
argu
against
a
straw
man
becaus
i
dont
think
that
anyon
here
is
argu
that
quackeri
pseudosci
homeopathi
chiropracti
and
tradit
chine
medicin
should
be
accept
a
scienc
i
in
particular
think
the
basic
idea
of
homeopathi
and
chiropracti
seem
extrem
flaki
what
some
of
u
do
believ
howev
is
that
some
of
these
thing
includ
some
of
the
flaki
idea
are
deserv
of
seriou
scientif
attent
if
in
fact
it
were
true
a
you
have
state
abov
that
those
who
do
not
use
the
current
fashion
methodolog
can
have
no
idea
what
is
effect
and
what
is
not
then
scienc
today
would
not
exist
for
all
of
current
scienc
is
base
on
the
past
work
of
scientist
whose
methodolog
by
current
standard
wa
serious
flaw
it
is
certainli
true
that
a
methodolog
improv
we
need
to
reexamin
those
result
deriv
in
the
past
use

perfect
methodolog
it
is
also
true
that
the
result
obtain
by
peopl
today
who
still
reli
on
those
earli
methodolog
need
to
be
reexamin
in
a
more
rigor
fashion
by
those
qualifi
to
do
so
credibl
but
to
say
that
nobodi
who
fail
to
do
elabor
doubleblind
studi
is
capabl
of
know
their
as
from

hole
in

and
to
say
that
no
