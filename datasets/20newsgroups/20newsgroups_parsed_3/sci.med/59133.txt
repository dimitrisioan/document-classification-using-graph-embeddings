i
find
thi
pretti
hard
to
believ
ha
anyon
els
heard
it
msg
is
mono
sodium
glutam
a
fairli
straight
forward
compound
if
it
is
pure
the
sourc
should
not
be
a
problem
your
comment
suggest
that
impur
may
be
the
caus
my
experi
of

effect
a
part
of
a
doubl
blind
studi
wa
that
the
pure
stuff
caus
me
some
rather
sever
effect
i
wa
under
the
possibl
incorrect
assumpt
that
most
of
the
msg
on
our
food
wa
made
from
process
sugar
beet
is
thi
not
true
are
there
other
sourc
of

ferment
chees
mushroom
all
contain
msg
i
am
one
of
those
folx
who
react
sometim
strongli
to

howev
i
also
react
strongli
to
sodium
chlorid
tabl
salt
in
excess
each
caus
differ
symptom
except
for
the
common
one
of
rapid
heartbeat
and
an
uncomfort
feel
of
pressur
in
my
chest
upper
left
quadrant
the
symptom
i
had
were
numb
of
jaw
muscl
in
the
first
instanc
follow
by
the
arm
then
the
leg
headach
lethargi
and
unabl
to
keep
awak
i
think

well
i
think

is
made
from

kind
of
plant
call
tapioca
and
not
