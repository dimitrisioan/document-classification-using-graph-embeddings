first
heard
about
it
in
thi
newsgroup
sever
year
ago
and

of
a
book

talk
about
vision
improv
by
relax
and
exercis
ha
there
been
ani
studi
on
whether
thi
method
actual
work
if
it
work
is
it
by
actual
shorten
the
previous
elong
eyebal
or
by
increas

len
abil
to
flatten

toolong
eyebal
sinc
myopia
is
the
result
of
eyebal
elong
seem
to
me
the
most
logic
approach
for
correct
is
to
find
a
way
to
revers
the
process
ie
shorten
it
somehow
prefer
nonsurg
ha
there
been
ani
recent
studi
on
thi
where
can
i
find
them
i
know
rk
work
by
chang
the
curvatur
of
the
cornea
to
compens
for
the
shape
of
eyebal
but
if
there
is
a
way
to
train
the
muscl
to
shorten
the
eyebal
back
to
it
correct
length
that
would
be
even
better
batess
idea
right
