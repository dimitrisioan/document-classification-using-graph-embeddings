a
from

is
there
anoth

remedi
a
a
robert

i
tri
to
email
you
but
our
board
is
have
internet
problem
so
im
not
sure
whether
you
got
the
inform
on
rutin
or
not
rutin
is
not
a
herb
but
part
of
the
bioflavonoid
complex
you
should
gener
not
take
rutin
by
itself
but
take
the
whole
bioflavonoid
complex
instead
if
you
dont
and
there
are
some
except
to
that
youll
eventu
creat
a
hesperidin
defici
which
is
the
other
major
compon
of
the
bioflavonoid
complex
i
found
out
the
hard
way
year
ago
when
i
recommend
rutin
after
it
show
defici
in
patient
who
were
not
defici
in
hesperidin
be
fore
a
later
retest
almost
alway
show
a
subsequ
defici
in
hesperidin
which
from
then
on
made
me
alway
add
bioflavonoid
to
anyon
that
had
veri
low
level
of
rutin
most
of
the
time
peopl
are
equal
low
in
rutin
and
hesperidin
so
there
is
realli
no
reason
to
take
rutin
by
itself
but
use
the
whole
bioflavonoid
complex
instead
i
have
sever
thousand
