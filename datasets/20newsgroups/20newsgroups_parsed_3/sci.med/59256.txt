the
reaction
came

wa
the
onli
differ
same

same
ingredi
how
do
you

thi
in
order
to
demonstr
your

you
would
have
had
to
supervis
the

on
both
occas
perhap
they
use

both
time
and
lie
about
it
perhap
onc
they
use
someth
that
had
begun
to
spoil
and
produc
some
bizarr
toxin
that
your
allerg
to
well
i
had
had
similar
reaction
mani
time
that
wa
when
i
realli
start
watch
care
reaction
to
dorito
hey
guess
what
in
there
reaction
to
lawri
season
salt
guess
what
in
there
ill
give
you
a
hint
ive
had
enough
problem
with
mani
mani
mani
differ
product
with
msg
that
i
figur
out
one
thing
unless
i
plan
on
get
sick
i
wont
eat
the
stuff
without
my
seldan
and
did
i
ever
learn
to
read
label
plea
note
that
i
am
not
say
you
are
make
it
up
i
am
just
tri
to
point
out
that
the
situat
is
not
alway
a
simpl
a
it
might
seem
which
wa
whi
i
start
check
everi
time
i
got
sick
and
everi
time
i
got
sick
msg
wa
somehow
involv
in
one
of
the
food
product
and
consid
there
were
no
other
similar
ingredi
to
my
knowledg
it
might
not
plea
a
medic
research
but
it
plea
my
own
person
physician
enough
for
him
to
give
me
allergi
medicin
and
most
importantli
it
enough
proof
for
me
to
avoid
it
and
enough
proof
that
my
incred
frugal
fianc
didnt
flinch
when
i
liter
threw
out
or
gave
away
all
the
food
product
in
hi
pantri
that
had
msg
and
he
alway
flinch
when
there
wast
but
it
wa
a
simpl
explan
i
wont
eat
thi
stuff
i
wont
cook
with
thi
stuff
so
i
can
either
throw
it
out
or
give
it
away
from
donna
patte
my
guess
wa
that
the
spice
mix
on
the
fri
contain
msg
probabl
lawri
season
salt
i
love
the
way
that
tast
im
not
say
i
never
consum
anyth
with
msg
ive
notic
that
i
have
a
certain
toler
level
like
a
small
bag
of
bbq
chip
onc
a
month
or
so
it
not
a
problem
but
that
same
bag
of
chip
will
bother
me
if
i
also
had
chicken
bouillon
yesterday
and
lunch
at
one
of
the
chine
restaur
the
day
befor
from
catherin
l
kelley
all
that
need
now
is
that
final
step
a
doubleblind
studi
done
on
human
there
isnt
even
an
ethic
question
about
possibl
harm
a
thi
is
a
wide
use
and
approv
food
addit
but
some
say
that
onli
of
the
popul
ha
a
problem
with
msg
some
say
it
more
like
but
let
say
that
it
how
mani
peopl
would
have
to
be
test
that
would
have
a
problem
also
i
know
i
have
a
problem
with
it
and
i
wouldnt
volunt
for
a
test
like
thank
guy
but
i
dont
want
to
get
sick
also
im
sure
that
most
peopl
probabl
have
vari
degre
of
sensit
at
differ
time
if
i
have
a
cold
im
much
more
suscept
to
the
reaction
than
when
im
healthi
a
proven
today
when
im
stuffi
but
for
some
silli
reason
i
still
gave
in
and
decid
to
have
the
bbq
chip
from
kiran
wagl
becaus
too
mani
of
you
gener
rhetor
you
not
you
cathi
go
around
call
thi
chine
restaur
syndrom
thu
suggest
to
the
peopl
you
complain
to
that
you
experi
thi
onli
from
chine
food
msg
is
preval
in
a
lot
more
thing
than
chine
foodthat
whi
i
suggest
call
thi
diner
syndrom
cathi
doesnt
i
havent
save
all
my
post
but
i
never
call
it
chine
restaur
syndrom
and
i
never
state
i
got
it
onli
from
chine
food
i
just
thought
it
would
be
easiest
to
conduct
my
person
test
at
a
chine
take
out
place
that
i
knew
would
hold
or
not
hold
the
msg
i
cant
call
up
whoever
make
dorito
and
ask
them
to
make
me
one
back
of
chip
without
msg
on
the
other
hand
if
one
complain
about
potato
from
a
mix
or
restaur
spice
mix
im
go
to
believ
them
and
if
anyon
say
they

had
the
reaction
in
