i
thought
there
were
type
of
cone
equival
to
rgb
your
basic
right
but
i
think
there
are
just
type
one
is
sensit
to
red
and
green
and
the
other
is
sensit
to
blue
and
yellow
thi
is
whi
the
two
most
common
kind
of
colorblind
are
redgreen
and
blueyellow
ye
i
rememb
that
now
well
in
that

the

are

im
not

to

cone
respond
to
particular
portion
of

just
a

respond
to

bluegreen
in
our

just

respond
to
a

etc
it
is
a
common
misconcept
to
confound
wavelength
specif
with
be
color
sensit
howev
the
two
are
not
synonym
so
in
sum
and
to
beat
a
dead
hors
when
the
output
of
a
cone
are
match
for
number
of
absorb
photon
irrespect
of
the

wavelength
the
cone
output
are
indistinguish
cone
are
simpli

are
not

more

the

ive
work

publish

on

for
over

so
the

is
