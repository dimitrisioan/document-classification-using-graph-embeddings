up

i
dont
understand
what
in

financi
for
the
physician
to
go
ahead
and
treat
unless
the
physician
ha
an
invest
in

some
kickback
scheme
with

experi
a

diseas
by
establish
link
to
the
lyme
commun
treat

thi
gp
can
go
from

thi
is
a
definit
temptat
harumph
get
publish
in
these
newslett
is
hardli
someth
to
aspir
to
i
cant
realli
argu
with
your
logic
though
i
think
you
may
be
extrapol
a
bit
recklessli
from
what
appear
to
be
a
sampl
size
of
one
even
if
what
you
say
about
thi
local
pittsburgh
guy
is
true
it
is
not
logic
or
fair
to
conclud
that
thi
is
true
of
all
doctor
who
treat
lyme
diseas
by
your
logic
i
could
conclud
that
all
of
the
physician
who
consult
for
insur
compani
and
make
money
by
deni
benefit
to
lyme
patient
are
do
it
for
the
money
rather
than
becaus
they
believ
they
are
encourag
good
medicin
i
have
no
idea
how
sincer
these
guy
are
but
their
motiv
are
a
suspect
a
the
physician
you
excori
for
what
you
believ
to
be
indiscrimin
treatment
i
would
realli
feel
more
comfort
discus
the
