previou

gee
mayb
ive
misjudg
you
russel
anyon
who
agre
with
someth
i
say
cant
be
all
bad
serious
im
not
sure
whether
i
misjudg
you
or
not
in
one
respect
i
still
have
a
major
problem
though
with
your
insist
that
scienc
is
mainli
about
avoid
mistak
and
i
still
disagre
with
your
content
that
nobodi
who
doesnt
use
method
deem
scientif
can
possibl
know
what
true
and
what
not
delet
materi
which
i
agre
with
back
to
lee
ladi
these
are
not
the
rule
accord
to
mani
who
post
to
scime
and
scipsycholog
accord
to
these
poster
if
it
not
support
by
care
design
control
studi
then
it
not
scienc
these
poster
are
make
the
mistak
that
i
have
previous
critic
of
adher
to
a
methodolog
recip
a
care
rule
such
a
support
the
hypothesi
by
a
care
design
and
control
studi
are
too
narrow
to
appli
to
all
investig
i
think
that
the
requir
for
particular
reason
to
be
convinc
depend
greatli
on
the
kind
of
mistak
that
have
occur
in
past
reason
about
the
same
kind
of
thing
to
reus
the
previou
exampl
we
know
that
conclus
from
uncontrol
observ
of
the
treatment
of
chronic
medic
problem
are
notori
problemat
okay
so
let
see
if
we
agre
on
thi
first
of
all
there
are
degre
of
certainti
it
might
be
appropri
for
instanc
to
demand
care
control
trial
befor
we
accept
a
absolut
scientif
truth
to
the
extent
that
there
is
ani
such
thing
the
effect
of
a
certain
treatment
on
the
other
hand
highli
favor
clinic
experi
even
if
uncontrol
can
be
adequ
to
justifi
a
preliminari
judgement
that
a
treatment
is
use
thi
is
often
the
best
evid
we
can
hope
for
from
investig
who
do
not
have
institut
or
corpor
support
in
thi
case
it
make
sen
to
tent
treat
claim
a
credibl
but
to
reserv
final
judgement
until
establish
scientist
who
are
qualifi
and
have
the
necessari
resourc
can
do
more
care
test
secondli
it
make
sen
to
be
more
toler
in
our
standard
of
evid
for
a
pronounc
effect
than
for
one
that
is
margin
i
come
to
thi
disput
about
what
scienc
is
not
onli
a
a
mathematician
but
a
a
veteran
of
mani
argument
in
scipsycholog
and
occasion
in
scime
about
nlp
neurolinguist
program
much
of
the
work
done
to
date
by
nlper
can
be
better
categor
a
inform
explor
than
a
care
scientif
research
for
year
now
i
have
been
tri
to
get
scientif
and
clinic
psychologist
to
just
take
a
look
at
it
to
read
a
few
of
the
book
and
watch
some
of
the
videotap
courtesi
of
your
local
univers
librari
not
for
the
purpos
of
make
a
definit
judgement
but
simpli
to
look
at
the
nlp
methodolog
especi
the
approach
to
elicit
inform
from
subject
and
look
for
idea
and
hypothes
which
might
be
of
scientif
interest
and
most
especi
to
be
awar
of
the
question
nlp
suggest
which
might
be
worthi
of
scientif
investig
over
and
over
again
the
respons
i
get
in
scipycholog
is
if
thi
hasnt
been
thoroughli
valid
by
the
accept
form
of
empir
research
then
it
cant
be
of
ani
interest
to
u
to
me
the
ultim
reducio
ad
absurdum
of
the
extrem
therev
got
to
be
control
studi
posit
is
an
nlp
techniqu
call
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
simpl
phobia
a
oppos
to
agoraphobia
may
not
be
the
world
most
import
psycholog
disord
but
the
nice
thing
about
them
is
that
it
doesnt
take
a
sophist
instrument
to
diagnos
them
or
tell
when
someon
is
cure
of
one
the
nlp
phobia
cure
is
a
simpl
visual
which
requir
le
than
minut
nlper
claim
that
it
can
also
be
use
to
neutral
a
traumat
memori
and
henc
is
use
in
treat
posttraumat
stress
syndrom
it
is
essenti
a
variat
on
the
classic
desensit
process
use
by
behavior
therapist
a
subject
onli
need
to
be
taken
through
the
techniqu
onc
or
in
the
case
of
ptsd
onc
for
each
traumat
incid
the
process
doesnt
need
to
be
repeat
and
the
subject
doesnt
need
to
practic
it
over
again
at
home
now
to
me
it
seem
pretti
easi
to
test
the
effect
of
thi
cure
especi
if
a
nlper
claim
the
success
rate
is
extrem
high
take
someon
with
a
fear
of
height
a
i
use
to
have
take
them
up
to
a
balconi
on
the
th
floor
and
observ
their
respons
spend
minut
to
have
them
do
the
simpl
visual
send
them
back
up
to
the
balconi
and
see
if
thing
have
chang
check
back
with
them
in
a
few
week
to
see
if
the
cure
seem
to
be
last
more
long
term
followup
is
certainli
desir
but
from
a
scientif
point
of
view
even
a
cure
that
last
sever
week
ha
signific
in
ani
case
there
are
mani
known
case
where
the
cure
ha
last
year
to
the
best
of
my
knowledg
there
is
no
known
case
where
the
cure
ha
been
revers
after
hold
for
a
few
week
my
own
cure
incident
wa
done
with
a
slightli
differ
nlp
techniqu
befor
i
learn
of
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
ten
year
later
now
i
enjoy
live
on
the
th
floor
of
my
build
and
have
a
larg
balconi
the
folk
over
in
scipsycholog
have
a
hundr
and
one
excus
not
to
make
thi
simpl
test
they
claim
that
onli
an
elabor
outcom
studi
will
be
satisfactori
a
studi
of
the
sort
that
nlp
practition
mani
of
whom
make
a
bare
margin
live
from
their
practic
can
ill
afford
to
do
most
of
them
are
also
just
plain
not
interest
becaus
the
whole
idea
seem
frivol
and
sinc
theyr
not
part
of
the
scientif
establish
they
have
no
tangibl
reward
to
gain
from
scientif
accept
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
is
over
ten
year
old
now
and
the
clinic
psycholog
establish
is
still
say
we
dont
have
ani
way
of
know
that
it
effect
these
academ
themselv
have
the
resourc
to
do
a
studi
a
elabor
a
anyon
could
want
of
cours
but
they
say
whi
should
i
prove
your
theori
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
one
make
the
claim
one
academ
in
scipsycholog
said
that
it
would
be
complet
unscientif
for
him
to
test
the
phobia
cure
sinc
it
hasnt
been
describ
in
a
scientif
journal
it
describ
in
a
number
of
book
and
ive
post
articl
in
scipsycholog
describ
it
in
a
much
detail
a
im
capabl
of
actual
at
least
one
fairli
care
academ
studi
ha
been
done
with
favor
result
but
it
appar
not
accept
becaus
it
a
doctor
dissert
and
not
publish
in
a
refere
journal
to
me
thi
sort
of
attitud
doe
not
advanc
scienc
but
hinder
it
thi
is
the
kind
of
thing
i
have
in
mind
when
i
talk
about
doctrinnair
attitud
about
scienc
now
mayb
i
have
been
unfair
in
imput
such
attitud
to
you
russel
if
so
i
apolog
in
the
argument
between
behaviorist
and
cognitivist
psycholog
seem
le
like
a
scienc
than
a
collect
of
compet
religi
sect
