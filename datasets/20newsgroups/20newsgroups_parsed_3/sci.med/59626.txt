wonder
how
someon

get
a
biopsi
in

my
understand
and
feel
free
to
correct
me
is
that
the
enzym
are
at
worst
mildli
elev
with
overal
normal
hepat
function
i
would
think
that
the
onli
clue
might
be
a
histori
of
prior
hepb
infect
and
a
posit
hepbsag
or
is
it
inde
on
a
continuum
with
cah
and
the
distinct
mere
