wrote
my
nearli
year
old
pomeranian
had
a
nasti
reaction
to
thi
vaccin
suffic
it
to
say
we
will
not
vaccin
her
for
lyme
diseas
again
she
been
camp
through
some
state
and
ha
backpack
with
u
a
well
and
we
are
use
to
watch
for
tick
and
deal
with
them
and
we
simpli
wont
take
her
to
realli
activ
lyme
diseas
area
not
to
drag
thi
out
anymor
but
mani
veterinarian
feel
that
lyme
diseas
in
dog
is
so
easi
to
treat
that
in
an
endem
area
they
often
just
give
the
appropri
antibiot
to
dog
present
with
lame
swollen
joint
fever
a
recent
paper
march
ha
final
establish
that
lyme
diseas
in
dog
can
be
reproduc
in
a
control
experimentali
set
thi
ha
been
an
ellus
matter
for
research
and
is
one
of
the
fundament
requir
for
mani
to
acknowledg
an
agent
a
be
causit
of
a
particular
diseas
up
to
now
onli
the
vaccin
manufactur
ha
been
abl
to
prove
that
the
diseas
exist
thi
paper
is
noteworthi
in
two
other
regard
none
of
the
anim
they
infect
were
treat
in
ani
way
the
dog
had
episod
of
lame
dure
a
week
period
which
occur
month
after
exposur
after
thi
period
none
show
ani
further
clinic
sign
up
to
the
month
observ
period
of
the
studi
so
these
are
proven
clinic
sick
lyme
patient
show
spontan
recoveri
without
the
benefit
of
drug
treatment
of
cours
observ
longer
than
month
will
be
necessari
to
be
sure
the
diseas
doesnt
have
the
same
chronic
that
some
see
in
human
the
addendum
to
the
paper
call
into
question
the
techniqu
use
by
the
vaccin
manufactur
to
valid
the
vaccin
of
cours
they
want
the
world
to
use
the
model
they
develop
in
order
to
test
vaccin
efficaci
anyway
mayb
we
will
see
some
independ
scientif
sound
evalu
of
thi
vaccin
in
the
next
year
