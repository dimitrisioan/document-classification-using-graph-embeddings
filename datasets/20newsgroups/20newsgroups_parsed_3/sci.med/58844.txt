flight

are

the

is
not

just
have
fantasi
they
arent

while
i
am
unfamiliar

here
it
appear
obviou
that
hi
specul
for
lack

in

go

to

the

thi
doe
not
seem
like
an
exampl
of
what
most
would
normal
call
a
flight
of

or
a

it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
you
mean
by
ration
v
irrat
perhap
you
can
give
a
few
exampl
of
surpris
experi
that
were
tri
out
for
perfectli

reason
or
interest
new
theori
that
were
first
advanc
from

ground
the
main
exampl
i
can
think
of
are
from
modern
highenergi
physic
which
is
not
typic
of
scienc
a
a
whole
well
i
think
someon
el
in
thi
thread
wa
the
first
to
use
the
word
also
extrascientif
etc
nor
am
i
prepar
to
give
a
gener
account
of
ration
in
term
of
exampl
there
is
some
danger
of
begin
to
quibbl
over
what
a
surpris
experi
is
what
count
a
surpris
etc
the
same
may
be
said
about
logic
ground
my
point
is
that
quit
frequent
perhap
even
most
frequent
the
root
of
a
new
theori
can
be
trace
to
previous
exist
theori
or
even
to
previous
reject
hypothes
of
some
other
theori
or
domain
i
would
offer
some
rather
well
known
exampl
such
a
toricelli
puy

experi
done
for

a
so
wa
the

and
the

of

ground
well
there
wa
a
pretti
success
and
well
know
theori
of

the
analog
to

by
toricelli
is
explicit
the
novelti
wa

a

but
thi
wa
quit
a

one
could
argu
that
it

the
extens
of
