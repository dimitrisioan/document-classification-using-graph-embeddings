i
think
it
is
import
to
verifi
all
procedur
with
proper
studi
to
show
their
worthi
and
risk

just
read
an
interest
tidbit
that
of
the
medic
treatment
are
unproven
and
not
base
on
scientif
fact
for
exampl
mani
treatment
of
prostat
cancer
are
unproven
and
the
treatment
may
be
more
danger

almost
everyth
doe
have
a
scientif
rational
the
most
common
treatment
for
