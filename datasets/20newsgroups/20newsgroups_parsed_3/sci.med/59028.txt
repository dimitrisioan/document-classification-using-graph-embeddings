is
common
in
mani
food
we
eat
includ
chines
though
some
orient
restaur
might
put
a
tad
too
much
in
them
ive
notic
that
when
i
go
out
and
eat
in
most
of
the
chines
food
restaur
i
will
usual
get
a
slight
headach
and
an
ununsu
thirst
afterward
thi
happen
to
mani
of
my
friend
and
rel
too
and
heh
we
eat
chines
food
all
the
time
at
home
but
we
dont
use
msg
when
were
cook
for
ourselv
so
when
we
put
one
and
one
togeth
it
can
be
safe
assum
that
msg
may
caus
some
allerg
reaction
in
some
peopl
stick
with
natur
thing
msg
doesnt
do
bodi
ani
good
and
possibl
harm
for
that

so
whi
bother
with

a
it
should
be
tast

dont
cloud
the
