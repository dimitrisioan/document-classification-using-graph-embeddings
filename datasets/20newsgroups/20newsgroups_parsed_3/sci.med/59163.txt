if
she
is
have
problem
with
fresh
veget
the
guess
is
that
there
is
some
obstruct
of
the
intestin
without
know
more
it
is
not
possibl
to
say
whether
the
obstruct
is
perman
due
to
scar
or
temporari
due
to
swell
of
inflam
intestin
in
gener
there
are
no
dietari
limit
in
patient
with
crohn
except
a
they
relat
to
obstruct
there
is
no
evid
that
ani
food
will
bring
on
recurr
of
crohn
it
is
import
to
distinguish
recurr
from
recurr
symptom
a
physician
would
think
of
new
inflamm
a
recurr
while
pain
from

just
impli
a

your

should
look
into
membership

good
