may
i
suggest
serious
that
if
the
doctor
and
wannabedoctor
on
the
net
who
refus
to
have
an
open
mind
on
altern
treatment
and
theori
such
a
the
yeast
theori
should
creat
your
own
moder
group
whi
is
there
some
reason
whi
you
feel
that
it
shouldnt
be
point
out
in
scime
that
there
is
no
convinc
empir
evid
to
support
the
exist
of
system
yeast
syndrom
i
dont
know
the
first
thing
about
yeast
infect
but
i
am
a
scientist
no
scientist
would
take
your
statement
no
convinc
empir
evid
to
support
the
exist
of
system
yeast
syndrom
to
tell
you
anyth
except
an
absenc
of
data
on
the
question
nore
ha
point
out
the
catch
that
if
the
crazi
theori
were
true
you
probabl
couldnt
find
ani
direct
evid
of
it
that
you
couldnt
observ
those
yeasti
beasti
with
present
method
even
if
they
were
there
nore
and
the
fellow
from
oklahoma
sorri
forgot
your
name
have
also
suggest
one
set
of
anecdot
evid
in
favor
base
on
their
person
experi
name
that
when
peopl
with
certain
condit
are
given
antifung
mani
of
them
appear
to
get
better
so
if
you
have
ani
evid
against
the
hypothesi
for
exampl
control
doubleblind
studi
show
that
the
antifung
dont
do
ani
better
than
sugar
water
then
let
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdot
and
uncontrol
evid
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
in
which
case
pleas
there
is
no
point
in
yell
back
and
forth
at
each
other
ani
longer
sinc
neither
side
ha
ani
convinc
evid
either
posit
or
neg
and
i
understand
that
your
abject
disbelief
is
base
on
the
exist
of
peopl
who
may
get
famou
or
make
money
appli
the
diagnosi
to
everyth
in
sight
make
wild
claim
with
no
evid
and
alway
refus
to
do
control
studi
but
that
ha
absolut
no
bear
on
the
appar
sincer
experi
of
the
peopl
on
the
net
observ
antifung
work
on
themselv
and
other
peopl
in
certain
specif
case
there
are
also
quack
who
sell
oral
superoxid
dismutas
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
complet
broken
down
in
the
gut
but
thi
doesnt
chang
the
genuin
scientif
knowledg
about
the
role
of
superoxid
dismutas
in
fight
oxid
damag
same
thing
just
caus
there
are
candida
quack
that
doesnt
establish
evid
against
the
candida
hypothesi
if
there
some
other
reason
besid
the
quack
if
onli
anecdot
to
think
it
could
be
true
then
that
is
what
ha
to
be
consid
that
is
what
the
net
peopl
have
been
talk
about
but
again
there
is
no
point
in
argu
about
it
there
is
anecdot
evid
and
there
is
no
convinc
evid
and
there
are
also
some
candida
quack
out
there
i
hope
everyon
can
agre
on
all
of
that
thu
it
appear
to
me
the
main
question
now
is
whether
the
propon
can
marshal
enough
anecdot
evid
in
a
convinc
and
document
enough
manner
to
make
a
good
case
for
carri
out
a
good
control
doubleblind
studi
of
antifung
or
els
forget
convinc
anybodi
els
to
carri
out
the
test
just
carri
it
out
themselv
and
also
whether
they
can
adequ
defin
the
patient
popul
or
symptom
on
which
such
a
studi
should
be
carri
out
to
provid
a
fair
test
of
the
hypothesi
ken
