too
mani
guidlein
have
been
set
on
the
number
of
dental
xray
and
chest
xray
that
one
should
have
over
a
given
period
of
time
becaus
of
all
the
environment
factor
that
can
caus
cancer

one
of
the
most
potentsplit

be
extrem
good
at

care
to
comment
most
stone
will
passbut
it
a
veri

unlik

i
dont
think
that
there
are
mani
drug
that
can
help
dissolv
the
kidney
stonewhich
is
probabl
calciumoxal
vitamin
c
and
magnesium
have
work
in

to
remov
calcium
from
calcifi
plaqu
in
the
ateri
wall
i
have
no
idea
if
a
diet
chang
or
supplement
could
speed
up
the
process
of
kidney
stone
passagebut
im
pretti
confid
that
a
diet
chang
andor
supplement
can
prevent
a
reoccur
if
surgeri
is
be
contempl
the
stone
must
be
in

tubul
a
second

is
a
good
idea
becaus
there
are
betterless
