on

percept

medic

necessari

which
im
fulli
cogniz

i
too
speak
jargones
when
with
my
peer
for
the
situat
in

mani
time
the
word
or
phrase
use
by
doctor
can
have
a
differ
and
more
specif
mean
than
the
same
word
use
in
the
world
at

signific
miscommun
one
exampl
word
and
veri
relev
to
the
yeast
discuss
is
the
exact
mean
of
system
it
is
now
obviou
to
me
that
the
mean
of
thi
word
is
veri
specif
much
more
so
than
it
mean
to
a
nondoctor
there
is
also
the
observ
of
thi
newsgroup
that
both
doctor
and
nondoctor
come
togeth
on
essenti
equal
term
which
when
combin
with
the
jargon
issu
can
further
fan
the
flame
thi
is
probabl
the
first
time
that
practic
doctor
get
realli
beat
up
by
nondoctor
for
their
view
on
medicin
which
they
otherwis
dont
see
much
of
in
their
practic
except
for
the
occasion
difficult
patient
point
i
understand
the
viewpoint
among
mani
practic
doctor
that
they
will
not
prescrib
ani
treatmentstherapi
for
their
patient
unless
such
treatment
have
been
shown
to
be
effect
and
the
risk
understood
from
wellconstruct
clinic
trial
usual
doubleblind
or
that
such
treatmentstherapi
are
part
of
an
approv
and
fund
clinic
trial
to
these
doctor
to
do
ani
differ
would
in
thi
belief
system
be
uneth
practic
and
it
follow
that
ani
therapi
not
on
the
accept
list
is
therefor
a
non
therapi
it
doe
not
even
exist
nor
doe
the

if

plausibl
by

no

either
from

pointofview
and
by
and
larg
a
a
scientist
myself
i
am
glad
that
medic
practic
scienc
take
such
a
rigor
approach
to
medic
treatment
howev
a
also
be
a
human
be
last
i
check
and
have
been
one
of
those
peopl
that
ha
been
significantli
help
by
a
current
unaccept
treatment
where
standard
medicin
wa
not
abl
to
help
me
ha
caus
me
to
sit
back
and
wonder
if
hold
such
an
extrem
and
rigid
scientif
viewpoint
is
in
itself
uneth
from
humanitarian
consider
after
all
the
underli
intent
of
the
scientif
approach
to
medicin
is
to
protect
the
health
of
the
patient
by
provid
the
best
possibl
care
for
the
patient
so
the
patient
should
come
first
when
consid
treatment
what
we
need
is
a
slightli
modifi
approach
to
treatment
that
satisfi
both
the
scientif
and
the
humanitarian
viewpoint
in
an
earlier
post
i
outlin
a
crazi
idea
for
do
just
that
the
gist
of
it
wa
to
give
ani
physician
freedom
and
encourag
by
the
medic
commun
to
prescrib
altern
not
yet
proven
therapi
mayb
support
by
anecdot
evid
for
patient
who
all
avenu
of
accept
therapi
have
been
exhaust
and
not
until
then
the
patient
would
be
fulli
inform
that
such
therapiestreat
are
not
support
by
the
proper
clinic
trial
and
that
there
are
real
potenti
risk
with
real
possibl
of
no
benefit
deriv
from
them
thi
approach
satisfi
the
need
for
scientif
rigor
it
also
satisfi
the
humanitarian
need
of
the
patient
and
the
realiti
is
that
mani
patient
who
have
reach
a
deadend
in
the
treatment
of
their
symptom
use
accept
medicin
will
go
outsid
the
orthodox
medic
commun
either
to
the
doctor
who
are
brave
enough
to
prescrib
such
treatment
at
the
risk
of
lose
their
licens
or
wors
to
nondoctor
who
have
not
had
the
proper
medic
train
thi
approach
also
recogn
thi
realiti
and
keep
the
control
more
within
orthodox
medicin
with
the
benefit
that
the
inform
glean
could
help
focu
limit
resourc
toward
futur
clinic
trial
in
the
most
product
way
everybodi
win
in
thi
admittedli
rosecolor
approach
im
sure
there
are
real
problem
with
thi
approach
a
well
it
is
present
more
a
a
strawman
to
stimul
discuss
hope
what
i
write
here
may
give
the
scime

a
better
idea
a

i
have
real
difficulti
read
appar
hostil
with
the
cold
of

to

i
believ
the
best
approach
to
medic
treatment
is
one
where
both
the
humanitarian
aspect
are
balanc
with
and
by
