question
conduct
is
more
appropri
call
unethicalin
my
opinion
use
laetril
to
treat
cancer
patient
when
such
treatment
ha
been
shown
to
be
ineffect
and
dangerouscyanid
releas
by
the
nci
hmm
thi
is
certainli
among
the
thing
i
would
refer
to
a
quack
therapi
and
would
tend
to
refer
to
ani
practition
who
prescrib
laetril
whether
licens
or
not
a
a
quack
there
are
uneth
behavior
such
a

unneccessari
test
to
increas
fee
which
i
would
not
labl
a
quackish
but
prescrib
known
ineffect
therapi
seem
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
hallmark
of
a
quack
david
rind
one
of
the
respons
of
a
licens
physician
is
to
read
the
medic
literatur
to
keep
up
with
chang
in
medic
practic
all
the
clamor
over
laetril
result
in
the
nci
spend
quit
a
bit
of
money
on
clinic
trial
which
provedto
me
anyway
that
laetril
wa
ineffect
against
cancer
a
physician
who
continu
to
use
it
when
better
more
effect
treatment
are
avail
may
deserv
to
be
call
a
quack
antifung
are
in
a
differ
class
the
big
question
seem
to
be
is
it
reason
to
use
them
in
patient
with
gi
distress
or
sinu
problem
that
could
be
due
to
candida
bloom
follow
the
use
of
broadspectrum
antibiot
gorden
rubenfeld
through
email
ha
assur
me
that
most
physician
recogn
the
chanc
of
candida
bloom
occur
after
broadspectrum
antibiot
use
and
they
therefor
reinnocul
their
patient
with
good
bacteria
to
restor
competet
for
candida
in
the
bodi
i
do
not
believ
that
thi
is
yet
a
standard
part
of
medic
practic
he
deal
with
critic
care
patient
where
fungal
infectionsystem
is
a
real
problem
and
just
becaus
he
tri
to
keep
good
bacteria
in
hi
patient
doe
not
mean
that
all
physician
do
thi
i
think
that
aspergillus
is
more
like
to
be
found
in
the
sinu
mucu
membran
than
is
candida
woman
have
been
known
for
a
veri
long
time
to
suffer
from
candida
bloom
in
the
vagina
and
a
woman
is
lucki
to
find
a
physician
who
is
will
to
treat
the
caus
and
not
give
give
her
advis
to
use
the
otc
antifung
cream
sinc
candida
colon
primarili
in
the
anorect
area
gi
symptom
should
be
more
common
than
vagin
problem
after
broadspectrum
antibiot
use
the
problem
we
have
here
david
is
proof
that
gi
discomfort
can
be
caus
by
a
candida
bloom
the
arguement
is
that
without
proof
no
action
is
warrent
medicin
ha
not

probalbi
never
will
be
