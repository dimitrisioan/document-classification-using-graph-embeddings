what
is
wrong
with
the
abov
observ
is
that
it
explicitli
give
the
impress
and
you
may
not
in
fact
hold
thi
view
that
the
common
perhap
even
the
correct
approach
for
a
scientist
to
follow
is
to
sit
around
have
flight
of
fanci
and
scheme
on
the
basi
of
hi
jealousi
and
petti
hatr
flight
of
fanci
and
other
irrat
approach
are
common
the
crucial
thing
is
not
to
sit
around
just
have
fantasi
they
arent
of
ani
use
unless
they
make
you
do
some
experi
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientist
whose
fantasi
lead
them
on
to
creativ
work
usual
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasi
wa
prior

the
danger
in
philosoph
about
scienc
is
that
theori
and
gener
can
end
up
be
far
remov
from
the
actual
daytoday
of
the
grunt
at
the
bench
ye
it
great
to
be
involv
in
a
process

night

just
do
someth

which
is
easi
enough
to
do

stamp

to
be

the

that
what
determin

is
what

not
in

research
the
surest
way
for
a
graduat

to
ruin
their
life
is
to
work
in
a
lab
where
the
bos
is
more
concern
with
flesh

with
