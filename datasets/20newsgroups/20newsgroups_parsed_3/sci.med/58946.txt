write
probabl
within
year
a
new
type
of
eugen
will
be
possibl
mayb
even
sooner
we
are
now
map
the
human
genom
we
will
then
start
to
work
on
manipul
of
that
genom
use
genet
engin
we
will
be
abl
to
insert
whatev
gene
we
want
no
breed
no
hybrid
etc
the
ethic
question
is
should
we
two
past
problem
with
eugen
have
been
reduc
the
gene
pool
and
defin
the
statu
of
the
eugen
insert
gene
would
not
seem
to
reduc
the
gene
pool
unless
the
insert
gene
later
becam
transmiss
to
progeni
then
they
may
be
abl
to
crowd
out
garbag
gene
thi
may
in
the
futur
becom
possibl
even
if
it
doe
awar
of
the
need
to
maintain
the
gene
pool
would
hope
mean
provis
will
be
made
for
save
gene
that
may
come
in
handi
later
evid
the
gene
for
sickl
cell
diseas
in
equatori
africa
and
for
diabet
in
the
hopi
promot
surviv
in
some
condit
we
dont
realli
know
what
the
futur
may
hold

etc
are

therefor
have

gene
a
possibl

is
a
good
strategi
for
speci
surviv
of
cours
the
statu
of
genet
alter
individu
would
start
out
a
no
differ
than
anyon
el
but
if
we
could
make
philosopherk
with
great
bodi
and
long
life
would
we
or
they
want
to
give
them
elev
statu
we
could
the
roman
did
it
with
their
king
without
the
benefit
of
such
eugen
the
race
eventu
realiz
and
dealt
with
the
problem
which
that
caus
but
for
a
while
it
wa
a
problem
orwel
introduc
u
to
the
notion
of
what
might
happen
to
person
genet
alter
for
more
menial
task
but
there
is
noth
new
under
the
sun
we
treat
slave
the
same
way
for
millennium
befor
i
see
no
inher
problem
with
gene
therapi
which
avoid
at
least
these
problem
human
have
alway
had
troubl
have
the
virtu
and
wisdom
to
use
ani
power
that
fall
into
their
hand
to
good
end
all
the
time
that
hasnt
stop
the
race
a
a
whole
yet
mani
are
the
civil
which
have
die
from
inabl
to
adapt
to
environment
chang
howev
also
mani
are
the
civil
which
have
die
from
the
abus
of
their
own
power
the
one
which
surviv
have
hope
learn
a
lesson
from
the
fate
of
other
and
have
surviv
by
make
better
choic
when
their
turn
came
not
that
i
dont
think
that
thi
gene
alter
power
couldnt
wipe
u
off
the
face
of
the
earth
or
caus
endless
suffer
nuclear
power
or
global
warm
or
whatev
could
and
may
still
do
that
too
the
real
issu
is
an
issu
of
wisdom
and
virtu
i
person
dont
think
man
ha
enough
wisdom
and
virtu
to
pull
thi
next
challeng
off
ani
better
than
he
did
the
for
last
few
we
a
eugenist
may
make
it
an
we
may
not
if
we
dont
i
hope
there
are
reservoir
of
garbag
peopl
out
in
some
backwat
with
otherwis
long
discard
garbag
gene
which
will
pull
u
through
i
believ
that
the
real
problem
is
and
will
probabl
alway
be
the
same
man
need
to
accept
input
from
the
great
spirit
of
god
to
overcom
hi
lack
in
the
area
of
know
how
to
use
the
power
he
ha
some
men
have
and
i
believ
all
men
may
listen
to
and
obey
the
still
small
voic
of
god
in
their
heart
thi
is
the
way
to
begin
to
reciev
the
wisdom
and
virtu
need
to
escap
the
problem
consequ
to
poor
choic
peopl
have
die
out
for
mani
reason
the
societi
which
fail
to
accept
enough
input
from
god
to
safe
use
the
power
they
had
develop
have
destroy
themselv
and
often
other
in
the
process
it
is
selfevid
that
the
one
which
surviv
today
have
either
accept
enough
input
from
the
spirit
to
use
their
power
wise
enough
to
avoid
or
surviv
their
own
mistak
thu
far
or
els
havent
had
enough
power
for
long
enough
in
summari
i
would
say
that
the
question
of
whether
to
use
thi
new
technolog
is
realli
an
ancient
one
and
the
answer
in
some
way
hard
in
some
way
easi
is
the
same
ancient
answer
it
isnt
the
power
it
is
the
spirit
sorri
for
the
long
post
got
carri
away
