becom
the
number
one
suspect
of
ani
problem
in
thi
case
it
might
be
just
food
poison
but
if

may
think
it
must
be
it
yeah
it
might
if
you
onli
read
the
part

quot
you
somehow
left
out
the
part
about
we
all
ate

same
thing
chang

onli
one
of
the
mani
possibl
caus

be
the
caus
it

equal
if

what

let
me
give
you
an
excert
from
a
recent
fda
hear
there

glutam
ha
ani
effect
on
the
brain
said
dr
richard
wurtman
of
massachusett
institut
of
technolog
the
anecdot
experi
of
individu
is
superstit
not
scienc
he
said
i
dont
think
glutam
ha
made
them
sick
and
dr
robert
kenney
of
georg
washington
univers
conduct
an
doubl
blind
test
in
show
that
the
peopl
who
react
to
msg
also
had
similar
reaction
when
they
thought
they
had
msg
but
actual
not
although
there
are
mani
contradict
person
stori
told
in
thi
group
some
of
them
might
have
been
due
to
other
caus
but
becaus
the
anti

emot
run
so
high
that
some
