i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
most
of
the
argument
about
scienc
in
scime
scipsycholog
etc
are
not
about
case
where
peopl
are
reject
scientif
argumentevidenceproof
they
are
about
case
where
no
adequ
scientif
research
ha
been
done
in
some
case
there
is
quit
a
bit
of
evid
but
it
isnt
in
a
format
to
fit
doctrinair
concept
of
what
scienc
is
here
it
is
again
thi
indic
confus
between
proof
and
the
process
of
do
scienc
you
are
make
precis
one
of
the
point
i
want
to
make
i
fulli
agre
with
you
that
there
is
a
big
distinct
between
the
process
of
scienc
and
the
end
result
a
an
end
result
of
scienc
one
want
to
get
result
that
are
object
verifi
but
there
is
noth
object
about
the
process
of
scienc
if
good
empir
research
were
done
and
show
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopath
remedi
thi
would
certainli
be
valuabl
inform
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathi
qualifi
a
a
scienc
thi
is
where
you
and
i
disagre
with
turpin
in
order
to
have
scienc
one
must
have
a
theoret
structur
that
make
sen
not
a
mere
collect
of
empir
valid
random
hypothes
experi
and
empir
studi
are
an
import
part
of
scienc
but
they
are
mere
the
culmin
of
scientif
research
the
most
import
part
of
true
scientif
methodolog
is
scientif
think
without
thi
one
doe
not
have
ani
hypothes
worth
test
no
hypothes
do
not
just
leap
out
at
you
after
you
look
at
enough
data
nor
do
they
simpli
come
to
you
in
a
flash
one
day
while
your
shave
or
look
out
the
window
at
least
not
unless
youv
done
a
lot
of
realli
good
think
beforehand
the
differ
between
a
nobel
prize
level
scientist
and
a
mediocr
scientist
doe
not
lie
in
the
qualiti
of
their
empir
methodolog
it
depend
on
the
qualiti
of
their
think
it
realli
bother
me
that
so
mani
graduat
student
seem
to
believ
that
they
are
do
scienc
mere
becaus
they
are
conduct
empir
studi
and
it
bother
me
even
more
that
there
are
mani
field
such
a
certain
part
of
psycholog
where
there
seem
to
be
no
think
at
all
but
mere
studi
test
ad
hoc
hypothes
and
im
especi
offend
by
russel
turpin
repeat
assert
that
scienc
amount
to
noth
more
than
avoid
mistak
simpli
avoid
mistak
doesnt
get
you
anywher
in
the
argument
between
behaviorist
and
cognitivist
psycholog
seem
le
like
a
scienc
than
a
collect
of
compet
religi
sect
