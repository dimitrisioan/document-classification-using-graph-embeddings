one
offer
and
am
wait
to

be
honest
about
my
experi
and
impress
about
the
medic
school
admiss
process
number
gpa
mcat

not
everyth
but
they
are
probabl
more
import
than
anyth
el
in
fact
some
school
screen
out
applic
base
on
these
number
and
never
even
look
at
your
other
qualiti
of
cours
when
thi
happen
dont
expect
a
refund
on
your
applic
fee
but
the
fact
that
you
got
four
interview
tell
me
that
you
have
the
number
and
are
veri
well
qualifi
academ
you
mention
one
respons
wa
it
an
accept
denial
or
waitlist
if
i
assum
the
worst
that
it
wa
a
denial
then
you
still
have
a
great
probabl
of
accept
somewher
how
did
your
interview
go
a
for
how
long
you
have
to
wait
ive
call
a
few
school
who
never
contact
me
for
anyth
mani
of
them
told
me
that
the
interview
season
for
them
wa
over
and
that
if
i
havent
heard
by
now
i
can
assum
a
denial
mani
reject
letter
are
not
sent
out
until
may
or
a
late
a
june
but
some
school
are
still
interview
i
realli
dont
think
you
should
worri
dont
becom
fixat
on
the
mailbox
go
out
have
fun
be
veri
proud
of
yourself
what
do
peopl
think
of
the
medic
school
admiss
process
i
had
a
veri
mediocr
gpa
but
high
mcat
score
and
i
have
been
work
a
a
softwar
engin
for
two
year
i
major
in
comput
scienc
at
stanford
still
i
think
the
profil
of
the
person
who
ha
the
best
chanc
of
get
admit
is
someth
like
thi
veri
import
gpa
or
better
mcat

colleg
or
univers
major
work
experi
anyth
el
you
want
them
to
know
anyway
you
are
in
good
shape
i
think
admiss
committe
are
bound
in
mani
way
by
the
number
but
would
like
veri
much
to
understand
each
person
a
an
individu
sometim
that
just
not
practic
but
get
four
interview
is
an
indic
that
you
have
the
number
hope
you
were
abl
to
impress
them
with
your
charact
good
luck
