can
anyon
out
there
tell
me
the
differ
between
a
persist
diseas
and
a
chronic
one
for
exampl
persist
hepat
v
chronic
hepat
i
dont
think
there
is
a
gener
distinct
rather
there
are
two
class
of
chronic
hepat
chronic
activ
hepat
and
chronic
persist
hepat
i
cant
think
of
ani
other
diseas
where
the
term
persist
is
use
with
or
in
prefer
to
chronic
much
a
these
two
term
chronic
activ
and
chronic
persist
sound
fuzzi
the
actual
distinct
between
the
two
condit
is
often
fairli
fuzzi
a
well
i
beg
to
differ
chronic
activ
hepat
impli
that
the
diseas
remain
activ
and
gener
lead
to
liver
failur
at
the
veri
minimum
the
patient
ha
persist
elev
liver
enzym
what
some
call
transamin
chronic
persist
hepat
simpli
mean
that
the
patient
ha
hbsag
in
hisher
blood
and
can
transmit
the
infect
but
show
no
evid
of
progress
diseas
if
i
had
to
choos
id
much
rather
have
the
persist
type
be
a
chronic
hbsag
carrier
doe
not
necessarili
mean
the
patient
ha
chronic
persist
anyth
person
who
are
chronic
carrier
may
have
no
clinic
biochem
or
histolog
evid
of
liver
diseas
or
they
may
have
chronic
persist
hepat
chronic
activ
hepat
cirrhosi
or
hepatocellular
carcinoma
most
case
of
chronic
persist
hepat
cph
are
probabl
the
result
of
a
viral
infect
although
in
a
good
number
of
case
the
caus
can
not
be
determin
the
diagnosi
of
cph
is
made
on
the
basi
of
liver
biopsi
it
consist
of
find
of
portal
inflamm
an
intact
periport
limit
plate
and
on
occas
isol
focu
of
intralobular
necrosi
but
in
contrast
to
chronic
activ
hepat
cah
there
is
no
periport
inflamm
bridg
necrosi
or
fibrosi
cph
ha
inde
an
excel
prognosi
if
i
had
to
choos
between
cah
and
cph
there
is
no
question
i
would
also
choos
cph
howev
a
david
point
out
the
distinct
between
the
two
is
not
a
neat
a
some
of
u
would
have
it
the
histolog
can
sometim
be
pretti
equivoc
with
biopsi
show
area
compat
with
both
cph
and
cah
mayb
it
is
a
sampl
problem
mayb
it
is
a
continuum
