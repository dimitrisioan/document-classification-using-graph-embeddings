write
an
odd
except
to
the
rule
seem
to
be
the
product
known
a
gumbo
file
thi
is
noth
more
than
coars
ground
dri
sassafra
leav
thi
is
not
onli
a
natur
product
but
a
natur
product
still
in
it
natur
form
so
mayb
that
how
they
evad
delani
or
mayb
a
special
exempt
wa
made

democrat
one
possibl
reason
is
that
file
is
made
with
sassafra
leav
while
root
beer
wa
made
with
sassafra
bark
or
root
bark
the
leav
contain
either
no
or
le
saffrol
than
the
bark
there
is
also
some
sort
of
treatment
which
put
remov
saffrol
from
sassafra
product
i
have
some
concentr
sassafra
tea
extract
which
is
claim
to
have
the
saffrol
remov
i
think
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
even
though
it
may
be
illeg
to
commerci
producesel
food
with
carcinogen
substanc
it
is
not
illeg
for
peopl
to
do
such
to
their
own
food
smoke
etc
is
thi
true
well
the
last
time
that
i
went
to
the
store
to
buy
sassafra
bark
to
make
root
beer
there
wa
a
sign
say
that
it
wasnt
sold
for
human
consumpt
also
when
i
ask
the
person
if
they
had
wild
cherri
bark
and
wintergreen
bark
she
made
a
point
of
tell
me
that
i
couldnt
buy
sassafra
for
human
consumpt
i
find
the
fact
that
some
peopl
reckless
enough
to
step
into
an

live
in

of
