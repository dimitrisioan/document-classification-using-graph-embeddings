should
patient
read
packag
insert
pdr
in
articl
ruth
ginzberg
write
hmmmm
here
one
place
where
i
realli
think
the
patient
ought
to
take
more
respons
for
him
or
herself
there
is
absolut
no
reason
whi
you
cant
ask
the
pharmacist
fill
the
prescript
for
the
physician
packag
insert
for
the
medic
when
you
pick
it
up
at
the
pharmaci
make
sure
to
tell
the
pharmacist
that
you
want
the
physician
packag
insert
not
the
if
peopl
are
go
to
do
thi
i
realli
wish
they
would
tell
me
first
id
be
happi
to
go
over
the
insert
in
the
pdr
with
them
and
explain
everyth
all
too
mani
patient
read
the
insert
and
panic
and
then
on
the
next
visit
sheepishli
admit
they
were
afraid
to
take
the
drug
and
we
are
start
over
again
at
squar
one
some
of
them
probabl
didnt
even
come
back
for
followup
becaus
they
didnt
want
to
admit
they
wouldnt
take
the
drug
or
thought
i
wa
tri
to
kill
them
or
someth
what
peopl
dont
understand
about
the
insert
is
that
they
report
everi
advers
side
effect
ever
report
without
substanti
that
the
drug
wa
respons
the
insert
is
a
legal
document
to
slough
liabil
from
the
manufactur
to
the
physician
if
someth
wa
to
happen
if
patient
want
to
have
the
most
use
and
reliabl
inform
on
a
drug
they
would
be
so
much
better
off
get
hold
of
one
of
the
ama
drug
evalu
book
or
someth
similar
that
is
much
more
scientif
there
are
veri
few
drug
that
someon
hasnt
report
a
death
from
take
patient
dont
realiz
that
and
dont
usual
appreci
the
risk
to
themselv
properli
im
sure
herman
is
go
to
go
ballist
but
so
be
it
anoth
problem
is
that
probabl
most
drug
have
been
report
to
caus
impot
half
the
male
who
read
that
will
fals
assum
it
could
perman
caus
them
to
lose
sexual
function
and
so
will
refus
to
take
ani
drug
like
that
thi
can
be
a
real
problem
for
pdr
reader
there
need
to
be
some
way
of
provid
patient
with
tool
gear
to
them
that
allow
them
to
get
the
inform
they
need
i
am
involv
in
a
research
project
to
do
that
with
migrain
a
the
domain
it
involv
a
comput
system
that
will
provid
answer
to
question
about
migrain
a
well
a
the
therapi
prescrib
for
the
patient
for
common
ill
such
a
migrain
and
hypertens
thi
may
help
quit
a
bit
the
patient
could
spend
a
much
time
a
need
with
the
comput
and
thi
would
then
not
burden
the
physician
clearli
physician
in
larg
part
fail
to
answer
all
the
question
patient
have
a

demonstr
over
and
over
here
on

net
where
we
get

thing
that
the
patient
should
have
found
out
from
their
physician
but
didnt
whi
they
didnt
isnt
alway
the
physician
