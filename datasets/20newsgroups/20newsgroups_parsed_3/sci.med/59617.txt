more
than
a
minut
or
so
i
tri
prozac
a
few
month
ago
and
had
some
insomnia
from
it
but
no
anxieti
or
jitter
i
probabl
could
have
live
with
the
insomnia
if
the
prozac
had
done
ani
good
but
it
onli
provid
a
tini
benefit
mayb
becaus
the
person
who
prescrib
it
didnt
know
much
and
gave
up
after
a
mg
dose
didnt

im
see
a
psychiatrist
who
ha
put
me
on
zoloft
anoth
serotonin
reuptak
inhibitor
like
prozac
one
pillday
mg
seem
to
help
some
now
im
tri
mgday
zoloft
ha
fewer
and
milder
side
effect
than
prozac
i
think
my
doctor
said
that
onli
of
the
peopl
take
zoloft
have
to
discontinu
it
becaus
of
side
effect
the
onli
problem
im
have
is
some
minor
gi
distress
but
noth
too
annoy
hope
the
zoloft
will
work

my
psychiatrist
strategi
seem
to
be
to
first
tri
one
of
the
serotonin
drug
usual
prozac
if
that
work
great
if
it
work
but
ha
too
mani

or
mayb
paxil
if
the
serotonin
drug
dont
work
at
all
tri
one
of

like
desipramin
suggest
a
to
the
next
step
have
a
doctor
who
know
someth
about
antidepress
can
make
a
big
differ
my
psychiatrist
claim
that
most
gp
and
fp
dont
have

experi
in
thi
area
and
from
what
ive
seen
im
inclin
to
believ
him
i
think
i
know
more
about
antidepress
than
the
peopl
at
my
famili
practition
offic
disclaim
im
not
a
doctor
what
i
know
