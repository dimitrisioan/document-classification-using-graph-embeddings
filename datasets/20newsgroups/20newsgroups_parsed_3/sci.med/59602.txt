in

while
just
my
experi
georg
paap
ive
got
a
veri
nice
collect
of
histor
book
on
medic
quackeri
and
on
the
topic
of
massag
thi
is
a
recur
theme
ordinari
massag
is
intend
to
make
a
person
feel
better
especi
if
they
have
muscular
or
joint
problem
but
like
chiropracti
there
are
some
practition
who
take
the
techniqu
to
a
far
extrem
invok
what
seem
to
me
to
be
quack
scienc
to
justifi
their
techniqu
in
the
case
of
massag
there
is
a
techniqu
call
deep
abdomin
massag
in
which
the
masseur
is
liter
attempt
to
massag
the
intestin
the
notion
is
that
undigest
food
adher
to
the
inner
surfac
of
the
intestin
and
putrifi
releas
poison
which
caus
variou
diseas
syndrom
by
thi
vigor
and
pain
procedur
it
is
alleg
that
these
deposit
can
be
loosen
up
and
pas
out
i
just
cant
believ
thi
idea
ha
ani
truth
behind
it
the
human
intestin
is
not
a
new
york
citi
sewer
pipe
and
even
if
it
were
you
eat
half
of
a
small
box
of
triscuit
and
there
aint
gon
na
be
nothin
stick
to
the
inner
surfac
of
your
intestin
mark

is
the
most
reason
post
that
ive
