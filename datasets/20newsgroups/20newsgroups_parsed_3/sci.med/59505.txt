the
second
issu
summar
he
ha
had
extra
heartbeat
for
the
past
to
year
and
onc
wa
symptomat
from
them
with
some
lightheaded
he
is
young
ish
thin
and
in
good
health
recent
bloodtest
were
all
normal
and
do
not
smoke
use
drug
or
caffein
etc
im
will
to
accept
the
extra
beat
a
normal
but
dont
want
to
ignor
them
if
they
might
be
some
kind
of
warn
symptom
the
number
of
pvc
seem
to
increas
throughout
the
day
and
with
exercis
or
someth
a
simpl
a
climb
some
stair
also
if
i
get
up
after
sit
or
lie
down
for
a
while
i
tend
to
get
a
coupl
of
extra
beat
could
they
possibl
be
relat
to
the
esophag
problem
both
seem
to
develop
at
about
the
same
time
i
not
an
expert
on
heart
problem
but
pvc
are
common
and
have
been
overtr
in
the
past
my
person
experi
and
i
have
the
same
histori
an
build
you
do
relat
to
the
heart
that
is
is
that
my
pvc
come
and
go
with
some
month
caus
anxieti
take
on
more
fluid
seem
to
help
and
they
seem
wors
in
the
summer
rememb
that
a
slow
heart
rate
will
allow
more
pvc
to
be
appar
so
perhap
it
is
an
indic
of
a
healthi
cardiac
system
but
ask
an
expert
about
that
last
point
especi
i
too
have
had
prematur
ventricular
heartbeat
start
in
these
are
not
by
the
way
extra
heartbeat
thi
is
how
they
feel
and
thi
is
how
i
describ
them
initi
to
the
doctor
but
theyr
actual
prematur
heartbeat
i
would
sometim
experi
a
lap
after
one
of
these
that
went
on
for
a
suffocatingli
long
period
of
time
make
me
wonder
if
my
heart
were
ever
go
to
beat
again
i
had
them
persist
for
eighteen
year
then
i
went
on
a
lowfat
diet
and
they
just
stop
i
havent
had
a
singl
episod
of
pvh
for
almost
two
year
i
know
correl
doe
not
impli
causat
thi
is
just
fwiw
