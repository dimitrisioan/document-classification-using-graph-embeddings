were
in

attribut
to
a
combin
of
lefthanded
rightey
domin
i
wa
part
of
a
studi
a
few
year
ago
at
the
univers
of
arizona
to
see
whether
cross
domin
individu
those
with
a
particular
handed
but
who
had
domin
in
the
opposit
eye
were
better
hitter
than
those
with
same
side
domin
of
hand
and
eye
i
wa
pick
from
my
softbal
class
becaus
i
wa
cross
domin
right
hand
left
eye
which
put
me
in
a
small
minor
and
the
grad
student
wa
tri
to
get
an
equal
number
of
cross
domin
and
same
side
domin
peopl
to
control
the
studi
she
use

i

actual
i
think
i
foul
tip
a
few
to
hit
the
ball
if
there
were
a
lot
of
peopl
like
me
in
her
studi
ie
those
who
cant
hit
fast
pitch
or
are
not
use
to
hit
off
a
machin
i
would
serious
question
the
result
of
that
studi
i
think
there
have
been
some
studi
of
major
leagu
player
across
a
fairli
larg
cross
section
of
player
to
test
whether
eye
domin
be
the
same
or
opposit
side
wa
better
but
i
dont
know
the
result
the
woman
who
ran
the
studi
i
wa
in
said
that
there
wa
a
higher
incid
of
crossdomin
in
major
leaguer
than
across
the
gener
popul
but
im
not
sure
whether
id
believ
