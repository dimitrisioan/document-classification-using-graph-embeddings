re
barbecu
food
and
health
risk
in
articl
mark
robert
thorson
write
i
dont
understand
the
assumpt
that
becaus
someth
is
found
to
be
carcinogen
that
it
would
not
be
legal
in
the
u
i
think
that
no
there
is
someth
call
the
delani
amend
which
make
carcinogen
food
addit
illeg
in
ani
amount
thi
wa
pass
by
congress
in
the
s
befor
stuff
like
mass
spectrometri
becam
avail
which
increas
detect
level
of
substanc
by
a
coupl
order
of
magnitud
thi
is
whi
thing
like
cyclam
and
red
were
ban
they
are
veri
weakli
carcinogen
in
huge
quantiti
in
rat
so
under
the
act
they
are
ban
thi
also
appli
to
natur
carcinogen
some
of
you
might
rememb
a
time
back
in
the
s
when
root
beer
suddenli
stop
tast
so
good
and
never
tast
so
good
again
that
wa
the
time
when
safrol
wa
ban
thi
is
the
activ
flavor
ingredi
in
sassafra
leaf
if
it
were
possibl
to
market
a
root
beer
good
like
the
old
day
someon
would
do
it
in
order
to
make
money
the
fact
that
no
one
doe
it
indic
that
enforc
is
still
in
effect
an
odd
except
to
the
rule
seem
to
be
the
product
known
a
gumbo
file
thi
is
noth
more
than
coars
ground
dri
sassafra
leaf
thi
is
not
onli
a
natur
product
but
a
natur
product
still
in
it
natur
form
so
mayb
that
how
they
evad
delani
or
mayb
a
special
exempt
wa
made
to
appeas
power
louisiana
democrat
i
think
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
even
though
it
may
be
illeg
to
commerci
producesel
food
with
carcinogen
substanc
it
is
not
illeg
for
peopl
to
do
such
to
their
own
food
smoke
etc
is
thi
true
