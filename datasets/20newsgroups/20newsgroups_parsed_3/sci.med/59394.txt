then
it
fall
off
a

on
thi
type
of

is
difficult
to

i
am
current
use
some
old
siemen
behind
the
ear
aid
which
keep
me
roughli
function
but
leav
a
lot
to
be
desir
recent
i
had
an
opportun
to
test
the
widex
q
behind
the
ear
aid
for
sever
week
these
have
four
independ
program
which
are
intend
to
be
custom
for
differ
hear
situat
and
can
be
reprogram
i
found
them
to
be
a
definit
improv
over
my
current
aid
and
wa
about
to
go
ahead
with
them
until
anoth
local
outfit
advertis
a
free
trial
of
anoth
programm
system
call
resound
unfortun
i
wa
onli
abl
to
tri
the
resound
aid
in
their
offic
for
about
minut
and
i
couldnt
compar
them
head
to
head
with
the
widex
nevertheless
it
did
appear
to
me
that
they
were
superior
and
i
wa
impress
by
what
i
wa
abl
to
read
about
the
theori
behind
them
which
i
will
give
in
a
separ
post
they
also
carri
the
widex
aid
and
had
one
patient
presum
wealthi
who
decid
to
go
ahead
and
get
the
resound
even
though
he
had
purchas

problem
is
that
