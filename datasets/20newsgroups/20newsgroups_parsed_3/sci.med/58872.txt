your

i

do
think
thi
show
some
confus
on
your
part
drum
roll
pleas
scienc
isnt
so
much
the
gather
of
evid
to
support
an
assert
read
hypothesi
a
it
is
the
gather
of
empir
observ
in
order
to
make
an
hypothesi
what
should
convinc
you
or
not
shouldnt
be
the
final
product
so
much
a
how
the
product
wa
made
here
your
error
there
is
no
observ
or
hypothesi
that
is
not
taint
by
theori
i
have
a
theori
i
make
observ
those
observ
will
be
made
with
my
theori
in
mind
ye
absolut
though
id
make
the
observ
in
a
more
gener
sens
of
all
observ
are
made
by
human
be
and
therefor
made
with
variou
bia
but
here
your
messag
leaf
talk
of
hypothesi
and
get
back
onc
again
to
equat
the
busi
of
scienc
with
the
end
result
the
gizmo
produc
scienc
work
veri
well
at
develop
theori
within
paradigm
but
is
veri
poor
at
deal
with
paradigm
shift
if
i
develop
a
novel
paradigm
that
explain
homeopathi
chines
medicin
or
spontan
combust
if
the
paradigm
is
use
it
will
show
me
the
way
to
make
observ
that
prove
or
disprov
it
my
point
isnt
so
much
whether
or
not
you
have
a
novel
paradigm
but
how
you
come
about
develop
it
the
paradigm
of
modern
medicin
is
that
the
bodi
can
be
reduc
to
a
set
of
essenti
mechan
oper
wherein
diseas
is
seen
a
malfunct
in
the
machineri
essenti
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
it
seem
like
that
theori
base
upon
thi
paradigm
do
not
give
a
complet
discript
of
the
univers
medicin
heal
etc
inde
we
now
recogn
an
import
psycholog
compon
to
heal
perhap
youd
admit
that
thi
is
an
oversimplif
on
your
part
the
topic
of
the
philosophi
of
scienc
is
made
for
them
im
make
them
too
but
i
think
that
it
also
summar
popular
misconcept
of
scienc
and
the
busi
of
do
scienc
biomed
research
doesnt
make
ani
basic
assumpt
that
arent
the
same
a
ani
other
disciplin
of
scientif
research
that
is
that
you
make
empir
observ
form
an
hypothesi
and
test
it
modern
medicin
ha
much
more
to
do
with
biochemistri
than
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
and
i
doubt
that
mani
psychologist
would
appreci
be
put
outsid
thi
empir
world
view
psycholog
also
ha
more
to
do
with
biochemistri
than
spoon
bend
it
is
also
import
to
distinguish
reason
from
scienc
scienc
may
be
reason
but
so
are
mani
nonscientif
methodolog
aristotl
reason
that
frog
came
from
mud
by
observ
one
hop
out
of
a
puddl
oversimplifi
of
cours
but
a
good
exampl
thi
is
an
empir
observa
tion
it
wa
then
test
though
perhap
not
by
aristotl
and
eventu
found
want
in
the
meantim
some
folk
will
have
continu
to
believ
in
the
spontan
gener
of
anim
life
there
noth
at
all
surpris
about
thi
it
the
way
the
gather
of
knowledg
work
there
are
probabl
more
than
a
few
thing
in
my
own
disciplin
of
molecular
biolog
that
will
be
found
to
be
total
offbas
even
idiot
to
someon
in
the
futur
these
futur
peopl
wont
have
come
to
these
relev
becaus
they
had
suddenli
gone
all
zenlik
and
had
a
vision
in
an
lsd
trip
someon
will
have
thought
of
someth
new
and
test
it
thi
is
the
bit
that
peopl
who
seem
to
relish
misrepres
scienc
and
research
cant
seem
to
wrap
their
mind
around
scienc
is
a
creativ
process
what
i
think
of
a
factual
and
good
research
can
be
total
turn
on
it
head
tommorrow
by
new
result
and
theori
again
i
think
it
get
down
to
defin
what
you
mean
by
scienc
i
often
dont
recogn
what
it
is
that
i
do
and
am
involv
in
in
the
way
scienc
is
portray
by
popular
medium
or
write
of
peopl
in
the
human
they
portray
scienc
a
a
collect
of
immut
fact
pronounc
of
truth
in
big
gold
letter
that
silli
it
a
though
we
just
go
into
the
lab
turn
over
a
stone
and
come
up
with
a
mechan
for
transcript
regula
tion
it
much
more
interest
than
that
it
realli
is
a
veri
human
process
