here
are
some
basic

i
so
like
the
way
thi
wa
written
in
the
new
zealand
book
that
im
lift
it
almost
verbatim
from
appendix
dwallach
let
your
shoulder
relax
let
your
elbow
swing
free
keep
your
wrist
straight
pull
your
chin
in
to
look
down
dont
flop
your
head
forward
keep
the
hollow
in
the
base
of
your
spine
tri
lean
back
in
the
chair
dont
slouch
or
slump
forward
alter
your
postur
from
time
to
time
everi
minut
get
up
and
bend
your
spine
backward
set
the
seat
height
first
your
foot
should
be
flat
on
the
floor
there
should
be
no
undu
pressur
on
the
undersid
of
your
thigh
near
the
knee
and
your
thigh
should
not
slope
too
much
now
draw
yourself
up
to
your
desk
and
see
that
it
height
is
comfort
to
work
at
if
you
are
short
thi
may
be
imposs
the
beest
remedi
is
to
rais
the
seat
height
and
prevent
your
leg
from
dangl
by
use
a
footrest
now
adjust
the
backrest
height
so
that
your
buttock
fit
into
the
space
between
the
backrest
and
the
seat
pan
the
backrest
should
support
you
in
the
hollow
of
your
back
so
adjust
it
tilt
to
give
firm
support
in
thi
area
if
you
oper
a
keyboard
you
will
be
abl
to
spend
more
time
lean
back
so
experi
with
a
chair
with
a
taller
backrest
if
avail
now
i
diverg
a
littl
from
the
text
a
