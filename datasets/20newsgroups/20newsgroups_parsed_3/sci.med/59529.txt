antihistamin
for
sleep
aid
for
a
veri
long
time
ive
had
a
problem
with
feel
realli
aw
when
i
tri
to
get
up
in
the
morn
my
sleep
latenc
at
night
is
also
pretti
long
rang
from
min
to
an
hour
i
get
about
hour
of
bedtim
mayb
of
actual
sleep
a
night
and
more
on
the
weekend
i
will
spend
two
or
three
hour
lay
in
bed
after
thi
if
i
can
becaus
i
feel
so
tire
when
i
wake
up
even
more
tire
than
i
wa
when
i
went
to
bed
which
is
usual
too
tire
to
work
anyway
i
recent
had
a
realli
bad
flu
so
i
call
a
friend
to
get
me
some
cough
syrup
with
both
an
expector
and
a
nasal
decongest
but
he
got
vick
formula
m
which
ha
everyth
but
an
expector
so
i
use
that
anyway
and
the
three
night
i
use
it
i
fell
asleep
rapidli
and
felt
that
i
got
realli
good
qualiti
sleep
that
is
i
actual
felt
refresh
the
next
morn
so
i
am
now
tri
to
look
into
both
in
the
literatur
and
experiment
the
use
of
antihistamin
a
sleep
aid
sinc
i
am
presum
that
it
wa
the
antihistamin
that
caus
the
effect
the
antihistamin
in
vick
formula
is
chloriphenamin
maleat
so
i
bought
some
gener
tablet
of
that
and
tri
one
last
night
and
didnt
notic
ani
improv
i
might
tri
one
with
a
littl
alcohol
about
beer
to
see
if
it
is
a
synerg
effect
also
librari
research
seem
to
show
that
benadryl
is
the
antihistamin
with
the
strongest
sed
effect
of
what
is
avail
otc
so
i
might
also
buy
a
gener
form
of
that
and
tri
that
the
pdr
seem
to
suggest
that
mg
is
a
good
dosag
level
to
tri
for
other
medic
inform
i
have
allergi
but
rare
have
an
allerg
reaction
live
in
new
mexico
i
also
have
chronic
dri
eye
which
get
horribl
if
i
tri
to
use
most
underarm
deoder
i
did
guess
that
my
problem
might
be
caus
by
hypoglycemia
so
i
made
some
chang
in
my
diet
consist
with
that
and
it
didnt
help
so
i
went
back
to
a
normal
diet
pretti
divers
also
take
vitamin
supplement
anyway
i
am
look
for
advic
for
the
use
of
antihistamin
a
sleep
aid
and
if
there
are
ani
danger
of
such
use
seem
safe
to
me
sinc
they
are
use
chronic
for
allergi
by
million
i
dont
want
to
tri
bz
becaus
bz
addict
seem
to
be
a
seriou
threat
and
from
what
i
hear
bz
sleep
qualiti
is
not
good
wherea
antihistamin
sleep
qualiti
seem
to
be
better
for
me
i
have
tri
some
dietari
tryptophan
load
stuff
and
that
also
seem
to
lower
sleep
qualiti
i
seem
to
wake
up
around
or
so
and
be
in
some
kind
of
mental
haze
until
or
also
i
would
be
interest
in
ani
other
advic
for

my
problem
