i
believ
it
is
illeg
for
a
resid
to
discrimin
against
fmg
is
that
true
i
know
some
that
wont
even
interview
fmg
i
think
a
case
could
be
made
that
thi
is
discriminatori
particularli
if
an
applic
had
good
board
score
and
recommend
but
wasnt
offer
an
interview
but
i
dont
know
if
it
ha
ever
gone
to
court
fmg
who
are
not
citizen
are
like
all
alien
in
a
difficult
situat
onli
citizen
get
to
vote
here
so
noncitizen
are
of
littl
or
no
interest
to
legisl
also
the
noncitizen
may
well
be
in
the
middl
of
process
for
resid
alien
statu
there
is
a
stron
sens
that
rock
the
boat
eg
su
a
resid
program
will
delay
the
grant
of
that
statu
perhap
for
ever
