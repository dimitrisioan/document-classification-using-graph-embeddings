re
opinion
on
allergi
hay
fever
shot
in
articl
eric
jacquier
say
from
now
on
it
look
like
shot
per
week
for
month
follow
by
shot
per
month
or
so
each
shot
cost
talk
about
soar
cost
and
the
health
care
system
i
would
call
that
a
racket
we
are
not
talk
about
rare
amazonian
grass
here
but
the
garbag
which
grow
behind
the
doctor
offic
apart
from
thi
issu
i
wa
somewhat
disappoint
to
find
out
that
you
have
to
keep
get
the
shot
forev
is
that
right
you
might
look
for
an
allergi
doctor
in
your
area
who
us
sublingu
drop
instead
of
shot
for
treatment
you
are
given
a
small
bottl
of
antigen
drop
are
place
under
the
tongu
for
minut
my
allergi
to
bermuda
grass
wa
neutral
thi
way
throughout
the
treatment
process
i
had
to
return
to
the
doctor
offic
everi
month
for
retest
and
a
new
bottl
of
antigen
after
the
allergi
wa
complet
neutral
a
bottl
of
mainten
antigen
last
me
about
month
the
sublingu
drop
are
then
taken
time
per
week
and
cost
so
the
cost
is
le
than
shot
and
it
is
more
conveni
just
to
take
the
drop
at
home
