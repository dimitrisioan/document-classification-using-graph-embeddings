hi
it
start
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
posit
i
wa
in
next
i
notic
that
when
i
ate
greasi
or
fatti
food
i
felt
like
my
entir
abdomen
had
turn
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
wors
howev
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
someth
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
a
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
say
i
have
cholistati
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatti
food
thi
make
sen
and
becaus
i
wa
alreadi
awar
of
what
seem
to
me
thi
caus
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoid
these
food
on
my
own
but
im
still
abl
to
eat
food
with
ricotta
chees
for
instanc
and
other
low
fat
food
but
doc
want
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
thi
mean
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
thi
anyway
no
nut
fri
food
chees
etc
i
am
allow
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anyth
sweet
eg
banana
also
i
must
onli
have
one
serv
of
someth
high
in
carbohydr
a
day
potato
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
veget
in
a
littl
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
veget
raw
or
steam
im
concern
becaus
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digest
process
and
if
g
for
one
week
she
probabl
want
to
see
how
you
react
to
the
diet
if
it
chang
anyth
you
can
live
on
the
diet
but
you
need
to
up
your
nonfat
calori
where
befor
you
had
a
pat
of
butter
now
you
need
a
medium
appl
probabl
microwav
cook
smaller
meal
but
more
of
them
not
terrif
amount
of
meat
it
hard
to
digest
anyway
first
even
fish
fowl
and
bread
have
fat
second
the
bodi
will
make
fat
out
of
carbohydr
if
it
need
them
third
your
bodi
like
most
peopl
wasnt
bred
to
live
on
a
high
fat
modern
diet
if
you
read
text
about
ancient
and
prim
peopl
you
will
read
about
the
luxuri
of
eat
fat
how
peopl
enjoy
it
thi
wa
becaus
it
wa
so
rare
even
cow
didnt
put
out
nearli
the
amount
of
butterfat
in
milk
that
they
do
now
for
comfort
and
to
make
the
carbohydr
meal
last
longer
eat
pasta
or
rice
which
give
their
calori
up
slowli
rather
than
bread
or
corn
mayb
smaller
meal
a
you
may
be
get
le

dure
the
last
month
when
you

shortwaist
it
easi
for
that

abdomin
muscl
if

have
le
gallbadd
surgeri
than
the
rest
of

popul
a
good
part
of
it
is
that
they
are
will
to
do
the
diet
etc
that
help
them
avoid

also
i
dont
think
the
