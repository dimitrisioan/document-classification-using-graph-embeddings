write
i
dont
know
the
first
thing
about
yeast
infect
but
i
am
a
scientist
no
scientist
would
take
your
statement
no
convinc
empir
evid
to
support
the
exist
of
system
yeast
syndrom
to
tell
you
anyth
except
an
absenc
of
data
on
the
question
the
burden
of
proof
rest
upon
those
who
claim
the
exist
of
thi
syndrom
to
date
these
claim
are
unsubstanti
by
ani
avail
data
hope
a
a
scientist
you
would
take
issu
with
anyon
overst
their
conclus
base
upon
their
data
beasti
with
present
method
even
if
they
were
there
nore
and
the
fellow
from
oklahoma
sorri
forgot
your
name
have
also
suggest
one
set
of
anecdot
evid
in
favor
base
on
their
person
experi
name
that
when
peopl
with
certain
condit
are
given
antifung
mani
of
them
appear
to
get
better
gee
i
have
mani
interest
and
enlighten
anecdot
about
myself
my
friend
and
my
famili
but
in
the
practic
of
medicin
i
expect
and
demand
more
rigor
rational
for
base
therapi
than
aunt

brotherinlaw
anecdot
evid
may
provid
inspir
for
a
hypothesi
but
rare
prove
anyth
in
a
posit
sen
and
unlik
mathemat
boolean
logic
rare
appli
directli
to
medic
issu
and
so
evid
of
except
doe
not
usual
disprov
but
rather
modifi
current
concept
of
diseas
so
if
you
have
ani
evid
against
the
hypothesi
for
exampl
control
doubleblind
studi
show
that
the
antifung
dont
do
ani
better
than
sugar
water
then
let
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdot
and
uncontrol
evid
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
in
which
case
plea
there
is
no
point
in
yell
back
and
forth
at
each
other
ani
longer
sinc
neither
side
ha
ani
convinc
evid
either
posit
or
neg
i
would
character
it
not
a
abject
disbelief
but
rather
scientif
outrag
over
vastli
overst
conclus
it
appear
to
me
the
main
question
now
is
whether
the
propon
can
marshal
enough
anecdot
evid
in
a
convinc
and
document
enough
manner
to
make
a
good
case
for
carri
out
a
good
control
doubleblind
studi
of
antifung
or
el
forget
convinc
anybodi
el
to
carri
out
the
test
just
carri
it
out
themselv
and
also
whether
they
can
adequ
defin
the
patient
popul
or
symptom
on
which
such
a
studi
should
be
carri
out
to
provid
a
fair
test
of
the
hypothesi
i
have
no
problem
with
such
an
approach
but
thi
is
not
what
is
happen
in
the
trench
of
thi
diagnosi
