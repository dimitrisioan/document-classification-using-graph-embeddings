albican
and
i
show
a
strong
posit
anoth
question
would
everybodi
show
the
same
strong
posit
so
thi
test
is
essenti
useless
and
assum
it
is
true
that
candida
can
grow
ye
everyon
who
is
normal
doe
that
we
use
candida
on
the
other
arm
when
we
put
a
tuberculin
test
on
if

dont
react
to

we
assum
the

those
who
will
deni
and
reject
ani
and
all
aspect
of
the
yeast
hypothesi
until
the
appropri
studi
are
done
and
that
is
if
you
cant
observ
or
cultur
the
yeast
bloom
in
the
gut
or
sinu
then
there
no
way
to
diagnos
or
even
recogn
the

and
i
know
they
realiz
that
it
is
virtual
imposs
to

observ
sinc
candida
is
everywher

it
you
can
rake
in

for
quit
some

i
have
often
wonder
what
an
md
with
chronic
gi
distress
or
sinu
problem
would
do
about
the
problem
that
he
tell
hi
patient
is
a
nonexist
syndrom
that
is
odd
isnt
it
whi
do
you
suppos
it
is
that
md
with
these
common
problem
dont
go
for
these
crazi
idea
doe
the
profession
jealosi
extend
to
suffer
in
silenc
even
though
they
know
they
could
be
cure
if
they
just
follow
thi
quack
