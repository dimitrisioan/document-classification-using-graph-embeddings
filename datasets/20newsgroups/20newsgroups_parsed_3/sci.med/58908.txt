write
doe
anyon
know
of
ani
method
to
reduc
thi
frequenc
my
younger
brother
each
tri
a
skin
transplant
thigh
to
nose
line
but
their
noseble
soon
return
ive
seen
a
refer
to
an
herb
call
rutin
that
is
suppos
to
help
and
id
like
to
hear
of
experi
with
it
or
other
techniqu
rutin
is
a
bioflavonoid
compound
found
among
other
place
in
the
rind
of
citru
fruit
these
have
been
popular
especi
in
europ
to
treat
capillari
fragil
and
seemingli
in
even
more
extrem
case
a
few
month
ago
a
friend
wa
visit
from
itali
and
he
said
that
hed
had
hemorrhoid
but
hi
pharmacist
friend
sold
him
some
pill
incredul
i
ask
to
look
at
them
and
sure
enough
these
contain
rutin
a
the
activ
ingredi
i
probabl
destroy
the
placebo
effect
from
my
skeptic
sputter
i
have
no
idea
how
he
do
hemorrhoidwis
these
day
the
studi
which
attempt
to
look
at
the
effect
of
these
compound
in
human
diseas
and
nutrit
were
never
veri
well
control
so
the
report
of
posit
result
with
them
is
mostli
anecdot
thi
stuff
is
pretti
much
nontox
and
probabl
inexpens
so
there
littl
risk
of
tri
it
but
i
wouldnt
expect
much
of
a
result
