got
my
bike
was
wanted
advice
on
cbc
purchase
thanks
to
all
of
you
who
gave
advice
on
the
cb
custom
as
recommended
i
had
the
bike
compression
tested
compression
was
a
little
low
but
very
even
across
the
four
cylinders
psi
they
said
that
it
was
tested
a
little
cold
so
that
would
explain
the
low
numbers
around
does
this
sound
right
otherwise
the
bike
looked
great
no
signs
of
road
rash
and
no
rust
this
bike
looks
great
it
is
now
in
the
shop
getting
tuned
and
new
tires
i
am
opting
for
the
metzler
me
and
me
tires
thanks
to
those
who
posted
this
other
thread
this
bike
is
big
compared
to
my
other
bikes
sure
is
alot
harder
to
load
on
a
trailer
than
the
kdx
was
i
should
be
road
legal
tomorrow
i
am
ignoring
the
afforementioned
concerns
about
the
transmission
and
taking
my
chances
being
a
reletively
new
reader
i
am
quite
impressed
with
all
the
usefull
info
available
on
this
newsgroup
i
would
ask
how
to
get
my
own
dod
number
but
ill
probably
be
too
busy
