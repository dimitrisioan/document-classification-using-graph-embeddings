new
seat
review
unable
to
stand
the
pain
anymore
my
wife
bought
the
corbin
gunfighter
and
lady
with
passenger
backrest
for
my
hawk
gt
it
came
with
no
instructions
but
it
came
weeks
earlier
than
they
said
it
would
installation
would
have
been
very
easy
but
the
seat
fastening
hardware
was
apparently
always
on
the
wrong
sides
with
the
stock
seat
it
never
was
easy
to
put
on
once
i
figured
that
out
the
new
seat
went
on
the
first
try
the
passenger
backrest
though
does
not
fit
as
i
thought
it
might
the
supplied
screw
to
set
the
backrest
angle
does
not
fit
and
i
have
not
yet
found
a
suitable
hard
sae
grade
or
perhaps
bolt
that
fits
there
is
a
a
soft
bolt
in
there
now
just
dont
lean
back
the
drivers
section
of
the
seat
is
a
bit
wider
seems
comfortable
enough
but
then
again
i
put
about
miles
on
the
stock
seat
without
a
thought
the
passengers
section
has
about
times
the
volume
of
foam
that
the
stock
seat
has
and
from
my
short
test
it
seems
much
more
comfortable
the
backrest
helps
a
bit
but
ive
not
has
enough
time
to
really
test
it
the
backrest
also
comes
with
a
small
pocket
its
now
more
difficult
to
swing
my
leg
up
over
the
taller
seat
if
i
go
on
the
threenotch
ride
soon
dixville
pinkham
smugglers
ill
give
a
more
complete
report
but
in
general
it
seems
like
an
improvement
