about
shafties
cant
do
wheelies
no
mike
it
is
imposible
due
to
the
shaft
effect
the
centripital
effects
of
the
rotating
shaft
counteract
any
tendency
for
the
front
wheel
to
lift
off
the
ground
good
point
johna
buddy
of
mine
told
me
that
same
thing
when
i
had
my
bmw
rgs
i
dumped
the
clutch
at
rpm
hey
ito
nly
revved
to
or
so
and
you
know
what
he
was
right
uh
folks
the
shaft
doesnt
have
diddleysquatpoop
to
do
with
it
i
can
get
the
front
wheel
off
the
ground
on
my
ferchrissake
you
may
have
been
able
to
bounce
the
front
up
but
not
actually
do
a
wheelie
see
the
shaft
effect
unloads
the
rear
susspension
and
effectivly
loads
the
front
this
is
why
a
shaft
bike
should
accelerate
if
it
starts
scraping
in
a
corner
laz
sorry
to
be
contradictory
but
ive
had
my
nighthawk
at
degress
with
the
horizon
and
i
wasnt
banked
over
in
a
turn
the
hard
part
is
getting
the
front
in
off
the
ground
i
rev
to
about
at
drop
the
clutch
even
harder
is
keeping
it
from
coming
up
to
far
i
use
the
back
brake
as
well
as
the
throttle
once
its
up
itll
wheelie
just
like
any
other
bike

hey
who
cuts
yer
hair
man
nothing
clears
the
mind
quite
cheech
and
chong
like
a
maxed
out
tach
and
a
a
closed
mouth
contains
no
feet
buried
