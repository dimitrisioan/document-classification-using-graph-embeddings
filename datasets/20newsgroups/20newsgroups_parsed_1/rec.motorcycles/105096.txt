re
dogs
vs
bikes
dogs
will
chase
anything
that
moves
i
have
two
dogs
and
they
love
chasing
me
when
i
ride
off
they
will
also
chase
any
car
that
passes
running
along
the
footpathsidewalk
at
up
to
kph
they
dont
seem
to
go
after
trucks
though
the
size
difference
must
be
a
factor
it
also
works
in
my
favour
though
i
can
exercise
them
quite
easily
by
riding
mile
up
the
road
and
back
a
few
times
