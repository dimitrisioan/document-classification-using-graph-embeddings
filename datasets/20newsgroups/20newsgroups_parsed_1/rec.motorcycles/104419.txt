splitfire
plugs
kinda
offical
yo
whaz
up
earlier
i
was
reading
on
the
net
about
using
splitfire
plugs
one
guy
was
thinking
about
it
and
almost
everybody
shot
him
to
hell
well
i
saw
one
think
that
someone
said
about
show
me
a
team
that
used
split
fires
well
heres
some
additional
insight
and
some
theories
about
splitfire
plugs
and
how
they
boost
us
as
oppossed
to
cages
splitfires
were
originally
made
to
burn
fuel
more
efficiently
and
increased
power
for
the
x
cages
well
for
these
guys
splitfires
increased
performance
by
increasing
torque
they
werent
focusing
on
horsepower
numbers
now
how
does
this
related
to
us
high
performance
pilots
well
that
depends
do
you
pilot
a
high
performance
or
cylinder
machine
in
the
case
of
cylinders
splitfires
would
increase
overall
torque
but
s
make
more
top
end
horsepower
with
its
torque
packed
down
low
so
for
s
splitfires
would
not
significantly
increase
power
but
what
about
twins
many
of
you
guys
laugh
at
some
of
us
twins
but
many
times
we
carry
less
weight
which
sometimes
can
make
up
for
the
hp
loss
see
doug
polen
vs
scott
russell
daytona
however
twins
make
more
torque
thoughout
their
powerbands
so
how
does
this
translate
increased
torque
should
theoretically
help
twins
make
more
power
splitfire
claims
that
there
should
be
not
extra
mods
or
anything
made
just
stick
em
in
now
i
dont
know
about
all
of
this
and
im
trying
to
catch
up
with
somebody
about
it
now
but
splitfires
should
help
twins
more
than
s
as
far
as
racing
teams
ducati
team
fast
by
ferraci
used
splitfires
in
the
season
this
is
when
they
had
jamie
james
running
for
em
but
i
dont
know
why
they
stopped
since
then
also
somebody
check
to
see
if
they
had
them
in
peace
warren
have
suzuki
will
travel
at
a
local
fixeruper
shop
the
bike
repairest
looked
at
a
dumped
zx
then
he
asked
the
guy
what
happened
i
dumped
the
clutch
how
fast
pretty
fast
insurance
nope
the
fixer
smiled
what
do
you
know
about
bikes
not
much
