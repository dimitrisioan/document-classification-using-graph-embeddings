i
understand
why
you
theoretically
stop
so
far
behind
a
car
but
can
you
really
in
actuality
avoid
such
an
incident
suggestions
if
possible
i
split
lanes
even
if
you
dont
get
all
the
way
to
the
head
of
the
line
at
least
you
wont
rearended
i
always
worry
more
when
im
in
the
lane
at
the
front
of
the
line
and
no
one
in
behind
me
then
you
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
your
mirrors
i
also
get
ready
to
pull
a
hard
right
just
in
case
