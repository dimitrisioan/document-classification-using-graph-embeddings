ive
seen
em
but
the
real
question
is
can

do
a
wheelie
on
a
lead
wing
if
so
how
high
would
the
front
wheel

off
the
ground

there
was
a
guy
around
here
who
would
do
them
on
an
early
pre
fairing
wing
with
a
hannigan
he
would
get
it
right
up
and
ride
a
ways
pretty
intimidating
sight
he
was
real
good
he
had
to
be
i
guess
you
wouldnt
get
away
with
chopping
the
throttle
more
than
once
