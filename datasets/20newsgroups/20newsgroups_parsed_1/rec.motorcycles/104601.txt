an
apartment
complex
where
i
used
to
live
tried
this
only
they
put
the
thing
over
the
drivers
window
so
they
couldnt
miss
it
i
can
see
the
liability
of
putting
stickers
on
the
car
while
it
was
moving
or
something
but
its
the
bdi
that
chooses
to
start
and
then
drive
the
car
in
a
known
unsafe
condition
that
would
seem
to
be
liable
an
effort
was
made
to
remove
the
sticker
it
came
to
pieces
leaving
most
of
it
firmly
attached
to
the
window
it
was
dark
and
around
pm
the
sticker
before
being
mangled
in
an
ineffective
attempt
to
be
torn
off
warned
the
car
would
be
towed
if
not
removed
a
reasonable
person
would
arguably
have
driven
the
car
had
an
accident
occured
i
dont
think
my
friends
attorney
would
have
much
trouble
fixing
blame
on
the
apartment
mangement
as
a
practical
matter
even
without
a
conviction
the
cost
and
inconvenience
of
defending
against
the
suit
would
be
considerable
as
a
moral
matter
it
was
a
pretty
fucking
stupid
thing
to
do
for
so
paltry
a
violation
as
parking
without
an
authorization
sticker
btw
it
wasnt
somebodys
spot
it
was
residentonly
but
unassigned
parking
ed
green
former
ninjaite
i
was
drinking
last
night
with
a
biker
and
i
showed
him
a
picture
of
you
i
said
dod
go
on
get
to
know
her
youll
like
her
the
grateful
dead
it
seemed
like
the
least
i
could
do
