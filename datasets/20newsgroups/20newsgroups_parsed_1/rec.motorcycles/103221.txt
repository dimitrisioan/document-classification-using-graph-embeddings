when
i
got
my
knee
rebuilt
i
got
back
on
the
street
bike
asap
i
put
the
crutches
on
the
rack
and
the
passenger
seat
and
they
hung
out
back
a
long
way
just
make
sure
theyre
tied
down
tight
in
front
and
no
problemo
hmm
sounds
like
a
useful
trick
itd
keep
the
local
cagers
at
least
a
crutchlength
off
my
taillight
which
is
more
than
they
give
me
now
but
do
i
have
to
break
a
leg
to
use
it
when
i
broke
my
ankle
dirtbiking
i
ended
up
strapping
the
crutches
to
the
back
of
the
bike
riding
to
the
lab
it
was
my
right
ankle
but
the
bike
was
a
gt
and
started
easily
by
hand
