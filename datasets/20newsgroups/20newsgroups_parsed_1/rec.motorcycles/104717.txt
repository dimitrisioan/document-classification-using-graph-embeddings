as
a
new
bmw
owner
i
was
thinking
about
signing
up
for
the
moa
but
right
now
it
is
beginning
to
look
suspiciously
like
throwing
money
down
a
rathole
let
my
current
membership
lapse
when
its
up
for
renewal
in
my
case
thats
not
for
another
years
so
id
appreciate
any
hints
on
what
will
keep
the
organization
in
business
that
long
and
preferably
longer
of
course
and
worth
being
part
of
become
an
activist
campaign
for
an
mc
insurance
program
for
universal
driverrider
training
before
licensing
pick
a
topic
dear
to
your
heart
and
get
the
organization
to
act
on
it
barnacles
dont
move
ships
