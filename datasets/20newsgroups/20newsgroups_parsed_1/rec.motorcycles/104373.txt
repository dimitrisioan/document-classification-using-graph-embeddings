it

the

on

the
suspension

motorcycle

dictate
how
quickly
you
can
swerve
to
avoid
obstacles

mjsnot
the

i
will
hey
ed
you
didnt
give
me
the
chance
sheesh
the
answer
is
absolutely
as
ed
so
eloquently
describes
edput
two
riders
on
identical
machines
its
the
edone
who
knows
what
hes
doing
and
why
that
will
be
faster
it
may
edbe
possible
to
improve
your
technique
if
you
have
no
idea
what
it
is
edthrough
trial
and
error
but
it
is
not
very
effective
methodology
edonly
by
understanding
the
technique
of
steering
a
motorcycle
can
one
edimprove
on
that
technique
i
hold
that
this
applies
to
any
human
edendeavor
herein
lies
the
key
to
this
thread
kindly
note
the
difference
in
the
responses
ed
and
i
are
talking
about
knowing
riding
technique
while
mike
is
arguing
knowing
the
physics
behind
it
it
is
possible
to
be
taught
the
technique
of
countersteering
ie
push
the
bar
on
the
inside
of
the
turn
to
go
that
way
without
having
to
learn
all
the
fizziks
about
gyroscopes
and
ice
cream
cones
and
such
as
seen
in
the
parallel
thread
that
stuff
is
mainly
of
interest
to
technomotorcycle
geeks
like
the
readers
of
recmotorcycles
but
doesnt
need
to
be
taught
to
the
average
student
learning
csteering
mike
doesnt
seem
to
be
able
to
make
the
distinction
i
know
people
who
can
carve
circles
around
me
who
couldnt
tell
you
who
newton
was
on
the
other
hand
i
know
very
intelligent
welleducated
people
who
think
that
you
steer
a
motorcycle
by
either
leaning
steering
a
la
bicycles
or
a
combination
of
and
knowledge
of
physics
doesnt
get
you
squat
knowledge
of
technique
