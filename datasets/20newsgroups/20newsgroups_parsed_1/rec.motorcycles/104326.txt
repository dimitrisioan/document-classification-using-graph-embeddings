oh
yeah
at
mph
in
the
quarter
is
such
a
slug
come
on
when
was
the
last
time
you
used
your
s
max
power
peak
i
think
maybe
you
should
ride
one
first
before
passing
judgement
there
is
a
lot
more
than
just
maximum
acceleration
i
really
didnt
mean
to
imply
that
my
ninja
was
any
better
than
a
duc
i
have
to
talked
to
a
few
duc
owners
ss
owners
in
particular
who
say
that
the
power
is
something
less
than
overwhelming
that
said
i
would
love
to
have
a
ss
i
guess
i
should
have
been
a
bit
more
specific
if
you
have
something
that
weighs
that
same
as
the
go
for
the
extra
cubes
i
think
that
fact
that
i
own
a
gtv
shows
that
i
dont
care
about
maximum
power
its
no
slug
though
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
the
note
and
the
handling
are
more
important
to
me
i
just
bought
a
ninja
because
i
couldnt
afford
a
duc
didnt
mean
to
ruffle
any
feathers
ill
probably
be
getting
a
ss
next
year
