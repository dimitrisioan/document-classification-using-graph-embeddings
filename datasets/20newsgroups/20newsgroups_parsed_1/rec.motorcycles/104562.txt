having
talked
to
a
couple
people
about
helmets
dropping
im
getting
about
dont
sweat
it
you
might
think
about
replacing
it
and
the
other
dont
ride
with
it
go
without
a
helmet
first
is
there
any
way
to
tell
if
a
helmet
is
damaged
structurally
i
dropped
it
about
feet
to
cement
off
my
seat
chipped
the
paint
didnt
seem
to
screw
up
the
actual
shell
id
bet
the
price
of
the
helmet
that
its
okayfrom
feet
or
higher
maybe
not
if
i
dont
end
up
replacing
it
in
the
real
near
future
would
i
do
better
to
wear
my
totally
nondamaged
face
dotrated
cheapie
which
doesnt
fit
as
well
or
keep
out
the
wind
as
well
or
wearing
the
shoei
rf
which
is
a
lot
more
comfortable
keeps
the
wind
out
better
is
quieter
but
might
have
some
minor
damage
id
wear
the
full
facer
but
then
id
be
way
more
worried
about
wind
blast
in
the
face
and
inability
to
hear
police
sirens
than
the
helmet
being
a
little
damaged
also
what
would
you
all
reccomend
as
far
as
good
helmets
im
slightly
disappointed
by
how
badly
the
shoei
has
scratched
etc
from
not
being
bloody
careful
about
it
and
how
little
impact
it
took
to
chip
the
paint
and
arguably
mess
it
up
period
looking
at
a
really
good
fullface
with
good
venting
wind
protection
i
like
the
shoei
style
kinda
like
the
norton
one
i
saw
awhile
back
too
but
suspect
im
going
to
have
to
get
a
much
more
expensive
helmet
if
i
want
to
not
replace
it
every
time
im
not
being
careful
where
i
set
it
down
well
my
next
helmet
will
be
subject
to
it
fitting
well
an
agv
sukhoi
thats
just
because
i
like
the
looks
my
current
one
is
a
shoei
task
and
its
getting
a
little
old
and
i
crashed
in
it
once
a
couple
of
years
ago
no
hard
impact
to
headmy
hip
took
care
of
that
if
price
was
a
consideration
id
get
a
kiwi
k
i
hear
they
are
both
good
and
cheap
christ
i
dont
treat
my
head
as
carefully
as
i
treated
the
shoei
as
far
as
tossing
it
down
and
i
dont
have
any
bruises
on
it
be
mildly
mildly
paranoid
about
the
helmet
but
dont
get
carried
away
there
are
people
on
the
net
like
those
you
mentioned
that
do
not
consistently
live
on
our
planet

within
the
span
of
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
heard
elements
of
separate
threads
which
in
that
they
have
been
conjoined
in
time
struck
together
to
form
a
new
chord
within
my
hollow

echoing
