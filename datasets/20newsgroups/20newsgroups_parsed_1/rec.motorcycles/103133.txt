hi

if
you
need
a
harley
we
have
lots
to
spare
here
all
the
yuppies
bought
the
best
a
couple
of
years
ago
to
pose
at
the
swine
bar
they
rode
a
mile
and
walked
the
rest
called
a
taxi
home
and
went
back
to
the
porsche
so
theres
are
loads
going
cheap
with
about
miles
on
the
clock
takes
a
while
to
coast
to
a
halt
cheers
