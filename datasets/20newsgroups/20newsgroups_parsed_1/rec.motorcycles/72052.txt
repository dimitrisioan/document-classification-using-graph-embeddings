it
turns
out
that
the
trailer
lights
were
not
hooked
up
to
the
truck
yep
basic
rule
never
expect
or
believe
turn
signals
completely
around
here
and
many
other
places
people
just
dont
signal
at
all
and
sometimes
the
signals
arent
working
sometimes
they
get
left
on
the
scary
bit
about
this
is
the
is
the
nonavailability
of
rear
lights
at
all
now
living
in
the
netherlands
ive
learned
that
the
only
reliable
indicators
are
those
red
ones
which
go
on
at
both
sides
at
once
some
people
call
them
brake
lights
once
they
light
up
expect
anything
to
occur
in
front
of
you
its
not
just
the
dutch
though
however
i
never
realised
how
much
i
relied
on
this
until
i
got
caught
a
few
times
behind
someone
whose
lights
didnt
work
at
all
once
id
sussed
it
out
it
wasnt
so
bad
knowing
it
is
half
the
battle
but
its
a
great
way
to
find
out
that
youve
been
following
someone
too
closely
now
i
try
to
check
for
lights
all
the
time
cos
that
split
second
can
make
all
the
difference
though
it
shouldnt
be
necessary
i
know
owen
what
used
to
peeve
me
in
canada
was
the
cars
with
bloody
red
rear
indicators
youd
see
a
single
red
light
come
on
and
think
now
is
he
stopping
but
one
brakelamp
is
not
working
or
does
he
have
those
dumb
bloody
red
rear
indicators
this
being
survival
you
have
to
assume
hes
braking
and
take
the
appropriate
actions
until
such
time
as
the
light
goes
out
and
on
again
after
which
you
can
be
reasonably
certain
its
a
bloody
red
rear
indicator
