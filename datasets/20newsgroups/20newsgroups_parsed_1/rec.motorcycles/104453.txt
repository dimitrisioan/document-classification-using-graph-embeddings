recommend
how
to
ship
a
motorcycle
from

and
how
much
might
it
cost
i

for
this
years
bike
week
i
rode
it
back
the
company
i
used
is
the
federal
cos
you
can
reach
them
at
ex
you
either
have
to
be
a
ama
member
or
maybe
it
is
just
a
discount
for
ama
not
sure
call
amajoin
to
become
an
ama
member
the
shipping
cost
is
based
on
the
number
of
miles
it
cost
me
about
for
portland
to
orlando
of
that
was
insurance
all
i
had
to
do
is
ride
it
to
the

out
i
think
they
can
also
pick
up
the
bike
from
any
business

bike
arrived
ontime
at
orlando
all
i
had
to
do
was
adjust
