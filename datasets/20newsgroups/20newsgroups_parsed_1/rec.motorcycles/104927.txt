re
need
advice
for
riding
with
someone
on
pillion
ive
never
ridden
pillion
very
much
but
recently
had
an
excellent
experience
passengering
with
dave
edmondson
at
pilot
while
in
london
i
found
that
it
upset
the
bike
much
less
if
i
rode
with
the
pilot
that
is
if
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
anticipated
when
i
should
hold
on
hard
for
braking
or
acceleration
i
tried
to
always
look
over
the
inside
shoulder
on
corners
and
move
as
little
as
possible
leaving
dave
to
manage
me
and
the
bike
as
he
normally
would
the
bike
and
luggage
hard
acceleration
can
be
quite
unnerving
as
the
feeling
of
being
spit
off
the
back
is
hard
to
fight
similarly
i
held
on
to
the
grab
handles
tightly
when
dave
needed
to
brake
so
as
not
to
mash
him
to
a
pulp
im
a
lot
bigger
than
he
is
reaching
around
him
and
pushing
off
the
tank
seemed
like
it
would
be
very
awkward
and
make
it
even
harder
for
him
to
manage
on
the
rare
occasions
when
i
carry
a
passenger
myself
i
absolutely
refuse
to
carry
anyone
who
is
not
properly
accoutered
for
riding
thats
helmet
jacket
gloves
stout
pants
and
shoesboots
as
a
minimum
its
not
my
responsibility
to
provide
this
gear
but
its
my
responsibility
to
require
it
if
they
want
to
ride
and
i
agree
with
an
earlier
poster
if
youve
not
had
much
experience
carrying
a
particular
passenger
and
especially
if
youve
not
carried
many
passengers
before
take
a
few
gentler
rides
of
some
duration
before
you
head
off
to
a
difficult
road
like
minesmt
hamilton
thats
a
nasty
place
to
find
yourself
in
trouble
