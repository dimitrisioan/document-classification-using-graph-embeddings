for
the
same
money
you
can
get
a
kryptonite
cable
lock
which
is
anywhere
from
to
thick
steel
cable
looks
like
steel
rope
shielded
in
a
flexible
covering
to
protect
your
bikes
finish
and
has
a
barreltype
locking
mechanism
i
dont
know
if
its
adjustable
but
my
source
says
its
more
difficult
to
pick
than
most
locks
and
the
cable
tends
to
squish
flat
in
boltcutter
jaws
rather
than
shear
model
fyi
ill
be
getting
a
krypto
cable
next
paycheck
a
word
of
warning
though
kryptonite
also
sells
almost
useless
cable
locks
under
the
kryptonite
name
when
i
obtained
my
second
motorcycle
i
migrated
one
of
my
kryptonite
ulocks
from
my
bicycle
to
the
new
bike
i
then
went
out
shopping
for
a
new
lock
for
the
bicycle
for
about
the
same
money
i
had
the
choice
of
a
kryptonite
cable
lock
advantages
lock
front
and
back
wheels
on
bicycle
and
keep
them
both
kryptonite
name
or
a
cheesy
noname
ulock
advantages
real
steel
i
chose
the
kryptonite
cable
after
less
than
a
week
i
took
it
back
in
disgust
and
exchanged
it
for
the
cheesy
noname
ulock
first
the
krypto
cable
i
bought
is
not
made
by
kryptonite
is
not
covered
by
the
kryptonite
guarantee
and
doesnt
even
approach
kryptonite
standards
of
quality
and
quality
assurance
it
is
just
some
generic
madeintaiwan
cable
lock
with
the
kryptonite
name
on
it
secondly
the
latch
engagement
mechanism
is
something
of
a
joke
i
dont
know
if
mine
was
a
particularly
poor
example
but
it
was
often
quite
frustrating
to
get
the
latch
to
positively
engage
and
sometimes
it
would
seem
to
engage
only
to
fall
open
when
i
went
to
unlock
it
thirdly
the
lock
has
a
little
plastic
door
on
the
keyway
which
serves
the
sole
purpose
of
frustrating
any
attempt
to
insert
the
key
in
the
dark
i
didnt
try
it
obviously
but
i
have
my
doubts
that
the
lock
mechanism
would
stand
up
to
an
insert
screwdriver
and
torque
attack
fourthly
the
cable
was
not
in
my
opinion
of
sufficient
thickness
to
deter
theft
for
my
piece
of
crap
bicycle
that
is
all
cables
suffer
the
weakness
that
they
can
be
cut
a
few
strands
at
a
time
if
you
are
patient
you
can
cut
cables
with
fingernail
clippers
aviation
snips
would
go
through
the
cable
in
well
under
a
minute
