from
russell
p
hughes
what
a
great
day
got
back
home
last
night
from
some
fantastic
skiing
in
colorado
and
put
the
battery
back
in
the
fxstc
cleaned
the
plugs
opened
up
the
petcock
waited
a
minute
hit
the
starter
and
bingo
it
started
up
like
a
charm
spent
a
restless
night
anticipating
the
first
ride
du
saison
and
off
i
went
this
morning
to
get
my
state
inspection
done
now
my
bike
is
stock
so
far
except
for
hd
slashcut
pipes
and
all
went
well
with
my
new
hampshire
state
inspection
meaning
all
my
lights
worked
ok
until
the
dude
produces
a
decibel
meter
and
tells
me
about
the
new
nh
law
about
mc
noisehuh
sez
iand
he
has
me
start
her
up
and
rev
to
about
rpmi
fail
cuz
i
register
db
and
the
max
allowed
is
if
i
fail
with
these
pipes
there
are
gon
na
be
a
whole
lotta
seriously
pissed
off
bikers
round
here
when
they
go
for
inspection
but
hey
its
a
new
experience
i
have
never
really
felt
like
a
menace
to
society
before
i
parked
dismounted
and
walked
in
to
my
building
with
a
slight
swagger
to
my
step
and
a
narrow
lidded
look
i
sensed
my
faculty
colleagues
unease
with
my
new
intimidating
statusand
womens
glances
seemed
to
linger
just
a
little
longeror
perhaps
that
was
my
imaginationsigh
now
i
need
to
install
my
new
bub
pipes
and
single
fire
ignitioni
wonder
how
i
will
do
after
that
russ
hughes
fxstc
dod
e
love
yeah
thats
the
feeling
you
get
when
you
like
something
as
much
as
your
motorcycle
sonny
barger
as
told
to
me
by
ed
campbell
who
has
an
old
friend
who
was
there
at
the
time
