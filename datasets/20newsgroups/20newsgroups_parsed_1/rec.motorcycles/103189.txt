i
think
ive
found
the
ultimate
summer
job
its
dangerous
involves
motorcycles
requires
high
speeds
in
traffic
and
it
pays
well
so
my
question
is
as
follows
has
anyone
here
done
this
sort
of
work
what
was
your
experience
stuff
deleted
get
a
good
atoz
type
indexed
streetmap
for
all
of
the
areas
youre
likely
to
work
always
carry
plenty
of
blackplastic
bin
liners
to
check
with
the
local
fire
department
my
buddy
is
a
firefighter
and
they
have
these
small
map
books
which
are
amazing
they
are
compact
easy
to
use
no
folding
they
even
have
a
cross
reference
section
in
which
you
match
your
current
cross
streets
with
the
cross
streets
you
want
to
go
to
and
it
details
the
quickest
route
they
gave
me
an
extra
they
had
laying
around
but
then
again
i
know
all
those
people
im
not
really
sure
if
they
are
supposed
to
givesell
them
the
police
may
also
have
something
similar
