after
reading

service
manual
for
my
bike
suzuki
gse
i
have
a
couple
of
questions
i
hope
you
can
answer
when
checking
the
oil
level
with
the
dip
stick
built
into
the
oil
fill
cap
does
one
check
it
with
the
cap
screwed
in
or
not
most
bikes
ive
seen
that
use
a
dipstick
rather
than
a
sight
glass
are
designed
to
check
it
without
screwing
it
in
in
the
manual
for
my
cbrrr
they
specifically
state
it
should
be
done
this
way
