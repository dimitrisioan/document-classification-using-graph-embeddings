riding
jacket
recommendations
my
old
jacket
is
about
to
bite
the
dust
so
im
in
the
market
for
a
new
riding
jacket
im
looking
for
recommendations
for
a
suitable
replacement
i
would
like
to
buy
a
full
aerostich
suit
but
i
cant
afford
for
it
right
now
im
considering
two
basic
options
buy
the
aerostich
jacket
only
dunno
how
much
it
costs
due
to
recent
price
increases
but
id
imagine
over
that
may
be
pushing
my
limit
advantages
include
the
fact
that
i
can
later
add
the
pants
and
that
it
nearly
eliminates
the
need
for
the
jacket
portion
of
a
rainsuit
buy
some
kind
of
leather
jacket
i
like
a
few
of
the
new
heingericke
firstgear
line
however
they
may
be
a
bit
pricey
unless
i
can
work
some
sort
of
deal
advantages
of
leather
are
potentially
slightly
better
protection
enhanced
pose
value
we
all
know
how
important
that
is
possibly
cheaper
than
upper
aerostich
requirements
for
a
jacket
are
that
it
must
fit
over
a
few
other
layers
mainly
a
sizing
thing
if
leather
id
prefer
a
zipout
lining
it
must
have
some
body
armor
similar
to
aerostich
elbows
shoulders
forearms
possibly
backkidney
protection
etc
a
reasonable
amount
of
pocket
space
would
be
nice
ventilation
would
be
a
plus
however
it
must
be
wearable
in
cold
weather
below
freezing
with
layers
or
perhaps
electrics
please
fire
away
with
suggestions
comments
etc
