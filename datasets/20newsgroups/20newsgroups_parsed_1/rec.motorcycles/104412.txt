dropped
my
shoei
rf
off
the
seat
of
my
bike
while
trying
to
rock
it
onto
its
centerstand
chipped
the
heck
out
of
the
paint
on
it
so
i
cheerfully
spent
on
a
bottle
of
testors
model
paint
and
repainted
the
scratches
and
chips
for
minutes
the
question
for
the
day
is
re
passenger
helmets
if
you
dont
know
for
certain
whos
gon
na
ride
with
you
like
say
you
meet
them
at
a
church
meeting
yeah
thats
the
ticket
what
are
some
guidelines
should
i
just
pick
up
another
shoei
in
my
size
to
have
a
backup
helmet
xl
or
should
i
maybe
get
an
inexpensive
one
of
a
smaller
size
to
accomodate
my
likely
passenger
do
i
have
to
be
the
one
to
say
it
dont
be
so
stupid
as
to
leave
your
helmet
on
the
seat
where
it
can
fall
down
and
go
boom
that
kind
of
fall
is
what
the
helmet
is
designed
to
protect
against
if
you
fall
with
the
helmet
on
and
you
hit
the
same
spot
the
helmet
landed
on
during
the
drop
the
helmet
may
not
protect
your
head
as
well
as
it
was
intended
to
do
conservative
recmotoers
will
recommend
that
you
replace
the
helmet
if
you
want
to
be
sure
that
it
will
protect
you
adequately
you
should
helmets
go
on
the
ground
on
a
table
on
a
chair
on
a
shelf
or
on
any
other
surface
that
is
large
enough
to
support
them
so
that
they
will
not
easily
be
knocked
down
jeezus
my
new
shoei
would
be
to
replace
you
think
im
going
to
leave
it
to
chance
cripe
later
