hola
amigos
quiero
i
need
an
answer
to
a
pressing
question
i
now
own
two
bikes
and
would
love
to
keep
them
both
one
is
a
capable
and
smooth
street
bike
low
and
lightweight
with
wide
power
and
great
brakes
the
other
is
a
beemer
gs
kind
of
rough
for
the
city
but
great
on
the
long
road
and
backroad
a
good
start
at
a
stable
but
i
dont
think
its
going
to
work
unfortunately
insurance
is
going
to
pluck
me
by
the
short
hairs
unless
some
insurance
agent
offers
a
multivehicle
discount
they
do
this
all
the
time
for
cars
assuming
that
youre
only
capable
of
driving
one
of
the
things
at
a
time
i
dont
think
ill
ever
manage
to
straddle
both
bikes
and
ride
them
tandem
down
the
street
turn
left
accelerate
the
zephyr
turn
right
accelerate
the
beemer
does
anybody
know
of
an
agency
that
makes
use
of
this
simple
fact
to
discount
your
rates
state
farm
doesnt
by
the
way
im
moving
to
the
bay
area
so
ill
be
insuring
the
bikes
there
and
registering
them
to
ease
me
of
the
shock
can
somebody
guesstimate
the
cost
of
insuring
a
zr
and
a
rgs
here
in
tucson
they
only
cost
me
full
and
liability
only
for
the
two
per
annum
muchas
gracias
enrique
