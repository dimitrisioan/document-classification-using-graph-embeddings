i
am
a
serious
motorcycle
enthusiast
without
a
motorcycle
and
to
put
it
bluntly
it
sucks
i
really
would
like
some
advice
on
what
would
be
a
good
starter
bike
for
me
i
do
know
one
thing
however
i
need
to
make
my
first
bike
a
good
one
because
buying
a
second
any
time
soon
is
out
of
the
question
i
am
specifically
interested
in
racing
bikes
cbr
f
gsxr
i
know
that
this
may
sound
kind
of
crazy
considering
that
ive
never
had
a
bike
before
but
i
am
responsible
a
fast
learner
and
in
love
responsible
and
in
love
i
believe
thats
a
contradiction
in
terms
unless
youre
really
brave
read
reckless
a
cc
sport
bike
will
go
way
faster
than
you
dare
for
at
least
your
first
year
of
riding
getting
more
than
that
really
is
overkill
as
youll
never
even
want
to
use
it
the
following
bikes
can
be
bought
and
repaired
cheaply
are
easy
for
a
novice
to
manage
and
are
plenty
high
performance
kawasaki
ex
honda
vf
interceptor
suzuki
gse
the
mph
time
of
the
ex
at
full
throttle
is
way
sooner
than
youre
ready
for
it
with
something
as
small
as
a
youd
probably
be
wishing
for
more
power
pretty
quickly
unless
its
a
tzr
or
rgv
now
im
not
saying
that
youre
certain
to
kill
yourself
immediately
with
a
f
or
a
gsxr
plenty
of
people
have
started
riding
on
those
bikes
and
done
just
fine
what
i
am
saying
is
that
its
a
waste
of
money
and
a
waste
of
perfectly
good
plastic
when
you
drop
the
thing
learning
how
to
balance
while
stopping
youll
never
get
the
throttle
more
than
half
open
anyway
so
why
spend
the
extra
bucks
