re
your
opinion
and
what
it

me
in
article

writes
in
my
view
drunk
driving
should
carry
a
mandatory
prison
sentence
it
is
one
of
the
traffic
offenses
which
is
not
a
public
funds
issue
but
a
genuine
safety
issue
so
if
you
bring
up
the
subject
on
recmoto
admitting
having
been
caught
dwi
and
looking
for
sympathy
over
the
consequences
dont
expect
people
to
respond
with
warm
wishes
