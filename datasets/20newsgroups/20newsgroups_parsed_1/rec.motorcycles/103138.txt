if
good
sam
got
bricks
delivered
first
class
postage
to
their
door
at
their
expense
i
bet
they
would
change
their
policies
about
mailing
lists
or
about
who
can
use
their
facilities
quickly
and
if
the
lord
god
almighty
parted
the
sky
and
make
a
personal
appearance
at
their
board
of
directors
meeting
they
would
also
change
their
policies
the
odds
are
about
equal
i
am
curious
as
to
how
many
bricks
i
will
have
to
send
before
this
situatiion
is
cleared
up
to
my
satisfaction
i
suspect
about
we
shall
see
youll
be
extremely
lucky
if
you
ever
get
one
through
ed
green
former
ninjaite
i
was
drinking
last
night
with
a
biker
and
i
showed
him
a
picture
of
you
i
said
dod
go
on
get
to
know
her
youll
like
her
the
grateful
dead
it
seemed
like
the
least
i
could
do
