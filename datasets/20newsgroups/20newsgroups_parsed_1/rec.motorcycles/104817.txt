allowed
yes
there
is
a
god
no
open
containers
on
the
street
was
the
signs
in
the
bars
yeah
right
the
or
so
cops
on
hand
for
the
couple
of
thousand
of
bikers
in
a
block
main
street
were
not
citing
anyone
the
street
was
filled
with
empty
cans
at
least
feet
deep
in
the
gutter
the
crowd
was
raisin
hell
tittie
shows
everywhere
can
you
say
party
and
still
we
wonder
why
they
stereotype
us
erc
whacha
mean
weifin
they
whom
ever
they
are
want
to
stereotype
me
as
one
that
likes
to
drink
beer
and
watch
lovely
ladies
display
their
beautiful
bodies
i
like
that
stereotype
if
you
were
refering
stereotype
to
infer
a
negative
you
noticed
we
didnt
rape
pillage
or
burn
down
the
town
we
also
left
mucho
bucks
as
in
money
with
the
town
me
thinks
the
town
likes
us
least
they
said
so
lynn
hall
nos
bros
they
bein
themfolk
who
tend
to
compose
fair
piece
of
the
population
bein
the
ones
that
regard
bikers
as
a
loud
irresponsible
irreverent
reprobate
rabble
sure
you
didnt
rape
and
pillage
its
a
relief
to
know
that
you
were
such
gentlemen
but
because
you
were
not
completely
outofhand
you
justify
your
lesser
indescretions
some
pretty
distorted
thinking
i
should
say
oh
im
sorry
i
just
noticed
that
you
left
mucho
bucks
as
in
money
nevermind
my
criticism
i
was
out
of
line
i
forgot
that
when
one
leaves
mucho
bucks
as
in
money
their
behavior
is
permissable
perhaps
even
justified
keep
in
mind
that
themfolks
are
the
ones
that
could
give
a
when
a
biker
gets
killed
when
their
elected
officials
institute
further
draconian
legislation
helmet
laws
gun
controls
etc
the
ones
that
dont
respect
our
rights
on
the
roads
because
we
do
not
respect
theirs
all
the
rest
of
the
time
need
i
continue
so
continue
to
wear
your
stigma
as
a
badge
but
the
next
time
you
are
whining
about
them
and
the
effect
of
their
values
on
yours
remember
that
it
was
probably
the
behavior
of
selfrighteous
wusses
like
myself
that
kept
them
at
bay
for
this
long
enjoy
