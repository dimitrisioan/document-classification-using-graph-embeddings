sheesh
even
a
trained
attack
dog
is
no
match
for
a
human
we
have
all
the
advantages
i
agree
with
this
me
too
for
chihuahuas
the
police
and
the
military
dont
train
dobermans
and
shephards
and
use
them
as
weapons
because
they
are
so
easy
for
the
average
joe
to
defeat
barehanded
you
may
have
opposing
thumbs
but
the
dog
has
teeth
so
effective
some
of
yours
are
named
for
him
he
has
ir
vision
better
hearing
and
better
smell
than
you
do
and
most
likely
faster
reflexes
youre
on
a
motorcycle
hes
on
paws
roll
on
and
blow
him
off
he
doesnt
even
have
net

all
things
have

b
whats
iridiot
responsedogs
have
more
rods
or
cones
im
not
sure
which
than
humans
and
this
allows
their
eyes
to
collect
more
light
in
lower
light
conditions
consequently
their
colour
vision
is
almost
nonexistant
i
mean
if
dogs
had
built
in
infrared
vision
the
armed
forces
would
be
strapping
them
to
missiles
instead
of
paying
a
quarter
million
for
ir
