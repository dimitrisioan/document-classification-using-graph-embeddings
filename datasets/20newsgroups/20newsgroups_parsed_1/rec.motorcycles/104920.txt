various

about
shafties
cant
do
wheelies
no
mike
it
is
imposible
due
to
the
shaft
effect
the
centripital
effects
of
the
rotating
shaft
counteract
any
tendency
for
the
front
wheel
to
lift
off
the
ground
good
point
johna
buddy
of
mine
told
me
that
same
thing
when
i
had
my
bmw
rgs
i
dumped
the
clutch
at
rpm
hey
ito
nly
revved
to
or
so
and
you
know
what
he
was
right
uh
folks
the
shaft
doesnt
have
diddleysquatpoop
to
do
with
it
i
can
get
the
front
wheel
off
the
ground
on
my
ferchrissake
you
may
have
been
able
to
bounce
the
front
up
but
not
actually
do
a
wheelie
see
the
shaft
effect
unloads
the
rear
susspension
and
effectivly
loads
the
front
this
is
why
a
shaft
bike
should
accelerate
if
it
starts
scraping
in
a
corner
