hello
netreaders
i
am
looking
for
a
little
netadvice
ive
got
my
eye
on
a
suzuki
gse
at
a
local
dealer
the
bikes
got
miles
on
it
and
looks
in
mint
condition
dealer
is
asking
a
bit
less
than
good
price
i
dont
have
access
to
a
blue
book
and
am
too
lazy
to
go
to
the
library
dealer
is
letting
me
testride
it
this
week
blue
book
says
wholesale
retail
sounds
like
you
are
getting
a
pretty
fair
price
assuming
it
is
in
nice
condition
