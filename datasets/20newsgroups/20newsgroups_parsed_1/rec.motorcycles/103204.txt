ouch
this
brings
to
mind
one
of
the
recommendations
in
the
hurt
study
because
the
rear
of
the
gas
tank
is
in
close
proximity
to
highly
prized
and
easily
damaged
anatomy
hurt
et
al
recommended
that
manufacturers
build
the
tank
so
as
to
reduce
the
er
step
function
provided
when
the
riders
body
slides
off
of
the
seat
and
onto
the
gas
tank
in
the
unfortunate
event
that
the
bike
stops
suddenly
and
the
rider
doesnt
i
think
its
really
inspiring
how
the
manufacturers
have
taken
this
advice
to
heart
in
their
design
of
bikes
like
the
cbrrr
and
the
gtsa
when
im
riding
my
rr
my
goodies
are
already
up
against
the
tank
because
the
design
of
the
corbin
seat
tends
to
move
you
forward
wouldnt
the
major
danger
to
ones
cajones
be
due
to
accelerating
into
and
then
being
stopped
by
the
tank
if
youre
already
there
there
wouldnt
be
an
impact
problem
would
there
