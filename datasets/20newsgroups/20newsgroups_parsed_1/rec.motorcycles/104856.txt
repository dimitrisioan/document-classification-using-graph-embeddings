i
felt
embarassed
at
this
point
to
be
a
motorcyclist
i
felt
the
eyes
of
those
in
cages
witnessing
this
display
then
glancing
over
to
the
dealers
lot
and
damning
all
those
on
two
wheels
needless
to
say
my
friend
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
and
we
left
did
you
express
your
embarrassment
to
the
owner
i
dont
blame
you
for
being
embarrassed
but
i
would
have
let
my
feeling
be
known
that
the
behaviour
of
their
sales
staff
and
apparent
enjoyment
of
such
behaviour
just
cost
them
a
sale
and
all
further
sales
i
will
now
turn
off
my
frustration
and
go
ride
peacefully
to
clear
my
anger
i
only
hope
that
the
cop
who
is
following
me
home
has
an
open
mind
and
doesnt
associate
me
with
them
sound
good
enjoy
btw
i
cant
afford
a
new
bike
who
can
merf
