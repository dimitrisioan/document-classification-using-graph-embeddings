trying
to
figure
out
a
way
to
put
a
halogen
beam
on
my
cbt
are
there
any
easy
ways
to
do
this
ie
a
slipin
bulb
replacement
was
told
by
a
guy
at
the
bike
shop
that
my
not
damn
near
bright
enough
incandescent
beam
might
be
caused
by
a
permalow
battery
so
i
went
and
picked
up
this
cheapo
motorcycle
battery
and
charging
system
tester
hook
it
up
to
the
battery
its
got
lights
on
very
good
charge
start
the
engine
to
test
the
charging
system
and
it
doesnt
even
register
its
supposed
to
light
or
lights
if
everything
is
ok
but
it
stays
down
at
the
same
point
as
just
the
battery
my
question
here
is
if
indeed
my
charging
system
is
just
plain
messed
up
how
the
heck
is
the
battery
staying
fully
charged
id
think
it
would
be
darned
near
dead
from
supporting
my
lights
etc
do
the
cbts
have
a
problem
with
their
charging
system
are
they
just
generally
slower
charging
than
what
is
normal
for
bigger
bikes
is
there
an
easy
fix
for
this
happy
noise
put
miles
on
my
bike
this
weekend
finally
got
myass
an
endorsement
which
is
really
good
because
my
cage
just
quit
running
worth
a
damn
and
i
wont
have
money
to
repair
it
until
the
first
and
the
weatherman
says
bright
and
sunny
all
week
chance
of
rain
on
friday
big
grin
bugs
in
teeth
