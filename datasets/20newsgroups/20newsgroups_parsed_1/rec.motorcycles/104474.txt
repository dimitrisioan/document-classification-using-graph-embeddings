back
in
my
youth
ahem
the
wiffy
and
moi
purchased
a
gadget
which
heated
up
water
from
a
v
source
it
was
for
car
use
but
we
thought
wed
try
it
on
my
rdb
it
worked
ok
apart
from
one
slight
problem
we
had
to
keep
the
revs
above
any
lower
and
the
motor
would
die
from
lack
of
electron
movement
on
my
lc
rz
to
any
excolonists
i
replaced
the
bolt
at
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
with
a
tap
when
i
wanted
a
coffee
i
could
just
rev
the
engine
until
boiling
and
pour
out
a
cup
of
hot
water
i
used
ethylene
glycol
as
antifreeze
rather
than
methanol
as
it
tastes
sweeter
