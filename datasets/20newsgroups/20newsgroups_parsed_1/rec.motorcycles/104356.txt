these
morgan
people
really
like
to
use
old
technology
i
think
their
suspension
design
hasnt
changed
since
they
went
from
wheels
to
back
in
the
s
and
its
not
like
they
had
reached
the
pinnacle
of
good
design
at
that
point
either
well
if
you
want
to
pick
on
morgan
why
not
attack
its
ash
wood
frame
or
its
handbent
metal
skin
just
try
and
get
a
replacement
i
thought
the
kingpost
suspension
was
one
of
the
mogs
better
features
