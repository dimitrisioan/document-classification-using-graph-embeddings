about

interestingly
enough
this
winnebago
of
bikes
is
faster
than
any
of
the
harleys
listed
it
depreciates
much
faster

according
to
cycle
magazine
yeah
they
depreciate
faster
than
harleys
for
the
first
couple
of
years
then
they
bottom
out
got
my
gli
w
miles
on
the
odometer
for
just
under
k
in
may
of
and
would
ask
for
now
with
almost
k
miles
onnitthats
about
of
what
a
new
gli
would
cost
think
the
gli
originally
sold
for
brand
new
not
sure
if
thats
the
case
then
it
depreciated
over
years
or
a
mere
big
fat
hairy
deal
based
on
what
i
know
harleys
tend
to
depreciate
your
monies
far
more
than
the
initial
depreciation
of
the
bike
itself
when
it
comes
to
parts
and
service
all
this
about
harleys
holding
their
value
better
doesnt
always
wash
away
the
knocks
on
themsuch
as
being
much
slower
according
