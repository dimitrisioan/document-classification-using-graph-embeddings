i
was
going
to
try
radial
keratotomy
but
they
want
over
per
eye
thats
a
lot
of
contact
lenses
and
sunglasses
and
a
lot
of
money
if
they
make
one
tiny
mistake
o
jeff
nichols
also
if
they
dont
get
it
exactly
right
or
your
eyes
change
again
contacts
to
correct
for
it
are
out
of
the
question
this
is
due
to
the
strange
conical
shape
your
cornea
takes
after
the
surgery
