t
tires
plus
fairing
question
i
have
a
question
about
tires
for
my
guzzi
it
is
a
t
the
tires
that
were
on
it
when
i
just
bought
it
are
old
and
cracked
i
do
not
have
an
owners
manual
for
it
yet
but
the
tires
listed
in
the
haynes
manual
are
front
h
rear
h
and
pressures
recommended
are
front
and
rear
oddly
the
pressure
for
the
same
tire
on
the
t
is
listed
at
psi
instead
anyone
know
the
reason
as
i
know
though
the
pressure
i
should
run
at
is
that
recommended
by
the
manufacturer
of
the
new
tires
i
purchase
the
real
question
i
have
is
this
the
old
tires
that
are
on
the
bike
are
for
the
front
a
metzler
touring
special
h
and
for
the
rear
an
avon
roadrunner
h
h
as
marked
on
each
tire
both
are
larger
than
that
listed
in
the
haynes
manual
what
does
the
owners
manual
recommend
and
was
it
common
to
go
up
one
size
for
this
bike
also
this
will
be
my
first
motorcycle
with
innertubes
any
comments
on
the
various
manufacturers
inner
tube
qualities
the
above
sizes
are
inches
except
for
the
additional
mark
on
the
current
rear
tire
what
is
the
best
metric
match
the
local
bmw
dealer
thought
h
on
the
front
and
h
on
the
back
he
also
happens
to
be
very
good
at
getting
close
to
matching
mail
order
prices
i
am
thinking
of
going
with
a
metzler
me
laser
possibly
comp
k
on
the
front
and
me
on
the
back
both
in
mbs
variety
if
possible
the
longer
lasting
belting
system
i
already
use
the
me
on
both
the
vision
and
fj
for
the
front
and
like
it
and
i
thought
that
with
the
shaft
drive
behavior
and
torque
from
the
guzzi
that
the
me
might
give
more
predictable
back
end
control
and
sliding
behavior
than
a
me
might
as
well
as
giving
much
better
tire
milage
life
any
comments
a
friend
told
me
he
thought
that
my
bike
had
boranni
rims
which
are
very
good
but
are
relatively
soft
and
have
delicate
sidewalls
i
do
not
wish
to
mount
the
tires
myself
this
first
time
so
aside
from
warning
the
shop
to
be
careful
any
other
comments
i
should
make
i
havnt
looked
at
the
rim
to
check
out
the
make
yet
if
it
is
marked
he
just
told
me
late
yesterday
and
i
havnt
had
a
chance
to
check
the
rim
type
on
another
note
i
will
remove
the
ugly
but
in
good
shapeanyone
want
it
vetter
fairing
and
i
will
run
without
a
windscreen
for
a
while
but
eventually
i
would
like
a
simple
rounded
cafe
style
quarter
fairing
for
it
it
could
be
forkhandlebar
mounted
any
suggestions
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
frame
mounted
quarter
fairing
of
the
cafe
style
for
this
bike
how
about
lower
barsclipons
for
it
i
would
like
to
restore
the
bike
into
a
good
condition
runner
with
a
few
modern
updates
but
while
not
being
historically
exactly
accurate
still
have
it
reflect
relatively
well
a
representation
of
the
cafe
style
yes
i
know
to
be
picky
that
period
really
predates
this
bikeit
is
just
that
this
bike
has
such
potential
for
that
look
