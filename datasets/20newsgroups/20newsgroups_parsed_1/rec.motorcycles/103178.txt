can
you
beat
this
ticket
personally
i
think
its
your
duty
as
a
citizen
to
make
it
as
much
trouble
as
possible
for
them
so
maybe
theyll
give
up
and
leave
us
alone
someday
soon
the
cop
was
certainly
within
his
legal
rights
to
nail
you
by
guessing
your
speed
mr
brown
the
author
of
fight
your
ticket
mentions
an
oakland
judge
who
convicted
a
speeder
on
the
officers
testimony
that
the
drivers
car
sounded
like
it
was
being
driven
at
an
excessive
speed
cough
choke
what
if
a
cop
gave
me
a
ticket
for
sounding
like
i
was
speeding
id
probably
show
up
in
court
without
a
lawyer
simply
because
sounding
like
speeding
is
ridiculous
if
i
was
found
guilty
id
appeal
and
then
show
up
with
a
lawyer
if
a
cop
doesnt
do
one
of
vascar
from
car
or
plane
radar
lidar
other
electronic
speed
measuring
device
pace
me
and
im
within
mph
or
so
of
the
limit
id
go
to
court
i
can
accept
a
cop
seeing
me
going
excessively
fast
like
over
the
limit
but
he
looked
like
he
was
going
or
so
in
a
zone
is
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
granted
i
may
well
lose
the
case
but
in
a
measured
by
eye
take
it
to
court
for
sure
axel
