how
to
act
in
front
of
traffic
jerks
nmmthe
other
day
it
was
raining
cats
and
dogs
therefor
i
was
going
only
to
nmmthe
speed
limit
on
nothing
more
on
my
bike
this
guy
in
his
bmw
was
nmmdriving
meters
behind
me
for
meters
and
at
the
next
red
light
i
nmmcalmly
put
the
bike
on
its
leg
walked
back
to
this
car
he
rolled
down
the
nmmwindow
and
i
told
him
he
was
a
total
idiot
and
the
reason
why
nmmdid
i
do
the
right
thing

mikkel
well
sounds
great
to
me
when
i
have
a
real
bdi
cager
tailgating
me
ive
found
that
an
effective
strategy
is
to
flash
my
brake
light
by
pumping
the
pedal
you
will
obviously
need
a
bit
of
free
play
in
your
brake
pedal
to
do
this
it
seems
that
even
the
most
brain
dead
idiot
can
usually
discern
that
a
flashing
red
light
directly
in
front
of
himherit
may
mean
that
something
is
wrong
sometimes
yes
sometimes
no
bdi
cagers
usually
move
back
then
hyperagressive
assholes
just
move
closer
something
about
testosteronestimulated
behavior
i
think
its
kinda
like
waving
a
red
flag
at
a
bull
all
in
all
if
you
cant
move
over
and
let
the
jerk
by
its
better
than
nothing

usenet
is
like
a
herd
of
performing
elephants
with
diarrhea
massive
difficult
to
redirect
aweinspiring
entertaining
and
a
source
of
mind
boggling
amounts
of
excrement

you
least
expect
