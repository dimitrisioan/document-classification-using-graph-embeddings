the
difference
of
opinion
and
difference
in
motorcycling
between
the
sportbike
riders
and
the
cruiserbike
riders
that
difference
is
only
in
the
minds
of
certain
closedminded
individuals
i
have
had
the
very
best
motorcycling
times
with
riders
of
cruiser
bikes
hi
don
eddie
yet
i
ride
anything
but
continuously
on
this
forum
and
on
the
street
you
find
quite
a
difference
between
the
opinions
of
what
motorcycling
is
to
different
individuals
cruiserbike
riders
have
a
different
view
of
motorcycling
than
those
of
sport
bike
riders
what
they
like
and
dislike
about
motorcycling
this
is
not
closedminded
to
not
recognize
this
is
in
effect
closeminded
a
lot
of
it
reminded
me
of
recmotorcycles
and
the
insipid
flameage
thereof
if
you
so
dislike
it
my
occasionally
leatherclad
poser
pal
why
read
it
i
scan
it
for
information
a
lot
of
it
is
noise
and
pointless
flameage
its
why
i
used
trn
instead
of
rn
if
you
have
a
problem
with
that
im
really
sorry
for
you
