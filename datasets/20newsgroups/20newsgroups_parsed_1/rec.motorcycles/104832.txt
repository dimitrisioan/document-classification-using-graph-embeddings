being
a
mere
female
i
have
often
found
i
cant
really
take
the
big
offensive
line
with
asshole
car
drivers
so
i
found
a
more
subtle
and
nastly
ooops
i
mean
nasty
way
to
get
back
at
them
if
somebody
cuts
you
up
just
wait
till
they
have
pulled
out
past
you
and
then
gently
lean
over
and
bend
their
aerial
every
time
i
have
done
that
it
has
eventually
snapped
off
near
the
base
which
tends
to
go
undetected
for
a
while
and
is
a
bummer
to
replace
gillian
dear
gillian
that
is
such
a
wickedly
cool
idea
why
didnt
i
think
of
it
however
here
in
canada
the
aerials
antenna
are
usually
near
the
driver
or
passenger
areas
and
i
would
surely
be
seenbut
ill
give
it
a
try
anyway
thanks
for
the
first
truely
useable
piece
of
information
i
have
heard
in
a
long
time
and
you
are
by
no
means
a
mere
female
as
this
way
at
getting
back
takes
real
guts
