i
am
looking
for
a
new
tank
bag
now
and
i
wondered
if
you
as
follow
fj
owners
could
make
some
suggestions
as
to
what
has
and
has
not
worked
for
you
with
the
fjs
large
flat
gas
tank
id
imagine
that
almost
anything
would
work
personally
im
quite
happy
with
my
eclipse
standard
tank
bag
me
too
even
after
i
bought
the
piece
krauser
k
set
now
and
then
dk
puts
them
on
sale
for
bux
or
so
to
clear
out
inventory
but
they
never
seem
to
to
go
away
they
are
the
volkswagens
of
tank
bags
i
guess
btw
the
late
paul
o
neill
showed
me
a
trick
with
a
pair
of
pliers
that
will
extend
their
life
considerably
when
the
zipper
starts
to
separate
behind
the
pull
because
of
age
and
wear
squash
the
pull
body
with
the
pliers
just
a
bit
to
tighten
it
back
up
i
would
have
tossed
my
bag
three
years
ago
but
this
fixed
it
up
and
kept
it
secure
and
reliable
chuck
rogers
