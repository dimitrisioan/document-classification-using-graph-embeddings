greetings
recmotorcyclists
coming
up
labour
day
weekend
this
year
worldcon
world
science
fiction
convention
will
be
held
in
san
francisco
california
i
am
planning
to
attend
and
have
been
speculating
on
doing
my
trip
there
by
motorcycle
instead
of
by
plane
as
was
my
initial
thought
i
live
and
would
be
departing
from
ottawa
ontario
canada
i
had
planned
to
take
two
weeks
for
this
trip
giving
me
days
travel
time
on
either
side
of
the
weekend
this
looks
like
a
distance
of
about
miles
km
if
your
distance
calc
is
correct
for
an
on
the
road
distance
and
not
as
the
crow
flies
this
is
km
a
day
for
days
if
you
spend
the
entire
time
on
interstates
which
would
be
a
total
waste
of
time
thats
at
least
hours
on
the
road
every
day
not
including
eatingpeeing
sightseeing
etc
i
was
contemplating
a
similar
trip
but
from
ottawa
to
la
or
maybe
ottawa
to
austin
tx
i
figured
if
i
wan
na
do
a
trip
of
this
magnitude
and
enjoy
it
id
have
to
get
my
ass
off
the
major
interstates
and
spend
lots
of
time
enjoying
the
country
around
me
ie
stopping
with
a
camera
meeting
townspeople
going
to
a
few
bars
no
sense
spending
weeks
looking
out
a
helmet
with
the
closest
human
contact
found
at
the
gas
pump
i
estimated
id
need
at
least
weeks
to
make
the
trip
worthwhile
i
am
looking
for
input
opinions
comments
or
snarky
remarks
on
my
sanity
in
question
suggested
routes
note
getting
there
is
important
and
my
schedule
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
room
for
side
trips
or
circuitous
routes
try
and
stay
off
the
interstates
anybody
who
wants
to
join
me
on
this
trip
for
even
part
of
the
distance
depending
on
your
route
and
my
plans
i
may
be
heading
that
way
as
far
as
at
least
detroit
anything
that
comes
to
mind
and
that
you
think
might
be
relevant
call
the
whithorse

motorcyclists

number

motorcyclists

general

looking
at

listings
of
bed

motorcyclists
