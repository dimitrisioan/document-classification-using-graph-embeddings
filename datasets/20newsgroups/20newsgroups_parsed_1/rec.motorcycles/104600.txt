aerostitch
or
piece
in
article
writes
request
for
opinions
which
is
better
a
onepiece
aerostitch
or
a
twopiece
aerostitch
were
looking
for
more
than
well
the
pc
is
more
versatile
but
the
pc
is
better
protection
thanks
in
advance
nadine
what
is
best
books
have
been
written
on
that
but
in
regard
to
aerostich
it
really
depends
on
your
particular
size
shape
and
needs
if
you
upper
and
lower
body
are
not
proportional
according
to
aero
dimensions
then
it
probably
is
going
to
be
better
mixing
and
matching
the
piece
suit
i
have
the
piece
suit
and
i
am
very
happy
with
it
having
my
life
quota
of
scars
from
crashing
off
road
i
am
very
concerned
with
good
protection
and
i
believe
that
the
difference
in
protection
between
the
and
piece
suits
is
almost
negligible
i
think
the
optional
hip
pads
and
back
protector
make
much
more
of
a
difference
one
thing
that
is
nice
about
the
piece
is
if
you
go
somewhere
and
then
want
to
walk
around
for
a
while
still
with
jacket
you
can
just
detach
and
stow
the
pants
one
thing
to
note
is
that
goldfine
has
problems
getting
a
good
fit
for
many
women
with
standard
suits
supposedly
for
smaller
women
and
petite
men
for
that
matter
the
piece
will
fit
better
another
recommendation
is
to
pay
for
mods
if
you
need
them
i
wish
i
got
inches
added
to
my
pant
legs
i
find
the
long
suits
are
not
really
that
long
i
cant
imagine
how
short
the
standard
suits
must
be
