i
had
read
a
review
that
said
the
engine
was
pretty
much
identical
to
the
gpz
but
that
the
suspension
and
frame
is
more
modern
the
fancy
piggyback
shocks
on
the
and
the
i
think
i
dont
know
about
the
zr
are
very
nice
way
adjustability
the
forks
are
crappy
they
dive
like
mad

had
progressive
springs
installed
and

made
a
huge
difference
