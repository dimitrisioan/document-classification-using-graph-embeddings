has
anybody
actually
carried
out
this
procedure
i
can
visualize
fewer
problems
with
canting
pistons
in
the
cylinders
with
this
method
but
more
trouble
with
keeping
the
bores
suspended
especially
for
the
first
two
pistons
and
with
working
space
to
insert
piston
pins
and
clips
especially
for
the
last
two
pistons
it
is
certainly
possible
and
quite
easy
in
most
cases
especially
on
twostrokes
its
very
common
to
do
this
on
bikes
where
the
cylindermounting
throughstuds
dont
prevent
the
cylinder
from
being
removed
with
the
engine
in
the
frame
i
did
this
when
i
assembled
the
top
end
on
my
indian
which
was
easier
yet
because
it
does
not
have
throughstuds
base
flange
studs
and
separate
head
bolts
dontchaknow
you
have
to
use
a
little
foresight
rags
duct
tape
etc
to
keep
clips
from
falling
in
clothespins
hoseclamps
etc
to
support
the
cylinder
while
youre
inserting
the
pins
are
these
called
gudgeon
pins
in
the
uk
if
so
whats
a
gudgeon
