i
was
reading
on
the
net
about
using
splitfire
plugs
one
guy
was
thinking
about
it
and
almost
everybody
shot
him
to
hell
well
i
saw
one
think
that
someone
said
about
show
me
a
team
that
used
split
fires
well
heres
some
additional
insight
and
some
theories
about
splitfire
plugs
and
how
they
boost
us
as
oppossed
to
cages
splitfires
were
originally
made
to
burn
fuel
more
efficiently
and
increased
power
for
the
x
cages
well
for
these
guys
splitfires
now
i
dont
know
about
all
of
this
and
im
trying
to
catch
up
with
somebody
about
it
now
but
splitfires
should
help
twins
more
than
splitfires
work
mainly
by
providing
a
moreorless
unshrouded
spark
to
the
combustion
chamber
if
an
engines
cylinder
head
design
can
benefit
from
this
then
the
splitfires
will
yield
a
slight
performance
increase
most
noticeably
in
lower
rpm
range
torque
splitfires
didnt
do
diddlysquat
for
my
gmc
pickup
l
v
but
do
give
a
noticeable
performance
boost
in
my
harley
sportster
and
my
best
friends
sportster
folks
i
know
whove
tried
them
in
evo
motors
cant
tell
any
performance
boost
over
plain
plugs
which
is
interesting
since
the
xlh
and
big
twin
evo
combustion
chambers
are
pretty
much
the
same
shape
just
different
sizes
two
of
my
friends
who
have
shovelhead
harleys
swear
by
the
splitfires
but
if
i
had
a
shovelhead
id
dualplug
it
instead
since
they
respond
well
enough
to
dual
plugs
to
make
the
machine
work
and
extra
ignition
system
worth
the
expense
plus
they
look
really
cool
with
a
spark
plug
on
each
side
of
each
head
