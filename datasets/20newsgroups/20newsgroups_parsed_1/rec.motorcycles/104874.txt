bmw
heated
grips

writes
to
those
of
you
who
have
the
bmw
heated
handgrips
are
they
comfortable
do
they
transmit
a
lot
of
vibration
how
do
they
compare
to
the
stock
grips
to
foam
grips
i
dont
have
the
grips
but
have
looked
into
getting
them
its
my
understanding
that
the
grips
themselves
are
the
standard
european
style
grips
now
coming
standard
on
the
bikes
krs
klt
etc
its
also
my
understanding
that
the
heater
resides
inside
the
bar
itself
so
if
anything
i
would
suspect
it
would
reduce
vibration
by
providing
more
bar
end
mass
i
dont
see
why
they
wouldnt
work
with
the
old
style
foam
grips
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
might
cause
the
foam
to
deteriorate
or
something
hard
to
belive
considering
they
do
fine
in
the
degree
texas
summers
course
i
dont
actually
have
them
so
you
can
save
your
flames
