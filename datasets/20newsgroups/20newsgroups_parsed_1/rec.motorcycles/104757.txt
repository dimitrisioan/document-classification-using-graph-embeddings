re
countersteering
sans
hands

how
do
i
steer
when
my
hands
arent
on
the
bars
open
budweiser
in
david
gibbs
replies
just
in
case
the
original
poster
was
looking
for
a
serious
answer
ill
supply
one
yes
even
when
steering
no
hands
you
do
something
quite
similar
to
countersteering
basically
to
turn
left
you
to
a
quick
wiggle
of
the
bike
to
the
right
first
causing
a
counteracting
lean
to
i
guess
i
was
semiserious
without
using
my
hands
i
lean
and
the
bike
turns
when
leaning
a
torque
is
applied
at
a
deg
angle
to
the
front
wheels
axle
just
as
in
countersteering
however
this
torque
is
also
about
deg
from
the
axis
of
the
steering
head
instead
of
making
the
bike
lean
gyroscopic
effect
makes
the
bars
turn
but
i
dont
remember
which
way
rick
oh
yeah
i
tried
this
in
the
driveway
on
the
centestandas
suggested
somewhere
else
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
work
the
same
