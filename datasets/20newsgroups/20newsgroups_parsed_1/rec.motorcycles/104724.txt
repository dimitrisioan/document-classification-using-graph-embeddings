writes
as
a
new
bmw
owner
i
was
thinking
about
signing
up
for
the
moa
but
let
my
current
membership
lapse
when
its
up
for
renewal
hints
on
what
will
keep
the
organization
in
business
that
long
become
an
activist
campaign
for
an
mc
insurance
program
for
universal
driverrider
training
before
licensing
pick
a
topic
dear
to
your
heart
and
get
the
organization
to
act
on
it
barnacles
dont
move
ships
youre
obviously
not
referring
to
any
of
the
three
abovequoted
individuals
because
barnacles
dont
each
send
to
the
crew
of
the
ship
to
keep
it
moving
get
the
organization
to
act
on
it
is
easy
to
say
but
says
little
about
what
one
really
can
and
should
do
what
the
organization
actually
will
do
is
largely
determined
by
the
president
and
directors
as
far
as
i
can
see
thats
what
makes
it
so
important
to
vote
in
an
election
of
officers
it
does
strike
me
that
the
bmwmoa
is
a
lot
less
politically
active
in
the
state
and
national
arenas
not
infighting
than
other
mc
organizations
should
we
change
this
or
just
join
the
other
groups
that
already
are
in
politics
incidentally
the
political
hazards
to
motorcycle
riders
in
the
us
at
the
moment
dont
compare
to
the
problems
of
some
other
groups
like
gun
owners
just
try
to
take
up
target
pistol
shooting
in
the
northeast
or
california
and
i
bet
youll
wish
you
only
had
to
worry
about
wearing
a
helmet
why
does
every
thread
on
recmoto
eventually
come
around
to
guns
