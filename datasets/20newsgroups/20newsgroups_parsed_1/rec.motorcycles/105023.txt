every
time
this
thread
comes
up
i
start
jumping
up
and
down
screaming
easy
wheels
easy
wheels
but
to
date
it
seems
like
im
the
only
one
who
s
ever
seen
this
its
absolutely
hysterical
basic
plot
is
this
reporter
searching
for
a
ring
of
babysnatchers
is
blow
off
the
road
by
a
very
hot
gang
of
babe

leather
he
is
rescued
from
his
wrecked
car
in
the
desert
by
a
xtian
gospal
biker
band
lead
by
an
ex
vietnam
vet
with
a
steel
plate
in
his
head
