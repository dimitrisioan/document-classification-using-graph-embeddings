i
need
some
advice
on
having
someone
ride
pillion
with
me
on
my
ninja
this
will
be
the
the
first
time
ive
taken
anyone
for
an
extended
ride
read
farther
than
around
the
block
well
be
riding
some
twisty
fairly
bumpy
roads
the
mines
roadmthamilton
loop
for
you
sf
bay
areans
you
sonuvabitch
rub
it
in
why
dont
you
we
have
great
weather
and
great
roads
here
unlike
the
rest
of
you
putzes
in
the
us
nyah

nyah
for
the
severely
humorimpaired
this
person
is
lbs
and
fairly
small
so
i
dont
see
weight
as
too
much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
i
want
her
to
hold
onto
me
rather
than
the
grab
rail
out
back
and
ive
heard
that
she
should
look
over
my
shoulder
in
the
direction
were
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
youll
likely
not
notice
her
weight
too
much
a
piece
of
advice
for
you
dont
be
abrupt
with
the
throttle
no
wheelies
accelerate
a
wee
bit
more
slowly
than
usual
consciously
worry
about
spitting
her
off
the
back
its
as
much
your
job
to
keep
her
on
the
pillion
as
it
is
hers
and
i
guarantee
shell
be
put
off
by
the
bike
ripping
out
from
under
her
when
you
whack
it
open
keep
the
lean
angles
pretty
tame
the
first
time
out
too
you
and
her
need
to
learn
each
others
body
english
she
needs
to
learn
what
your
idea
is
about
how
to
take
the
turn
and
you
need
to
learn
her
idea
of
shit
dont
crash
now
so
you
dont
work
at
cross
purposes
while
leaned
over
you
can
work
up
to
more
aggressive
riding
over
time
a
very
important
thing
tell
her
to
put
her
hand
against
the
tank
when
you
brakethis
could
save
you
some
severely
crushed
cookies
have
