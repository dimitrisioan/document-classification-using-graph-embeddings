thoughts
on
a
yamaha
seca
turbo
in
a
previous
article
says
i
was
wondering
if
anybody
knows
anything
about
a
yamaha
seca
turbo
im
considering
buying
a
used
seca
turbo
for
canadian
us
with
km
on
the
odo
this
will
be
my
first
bike
any
comments
because
of
this
i
can
not
in
good
faith
recommend
a
seca
turbo
power
delivery
is
too
uneven
for
a
novice
the
official
tm
dod
newbie
bike
of
choice
would
be
more
appropriate
because
the
powerband
is
so
wide
and
delivery
is
very
smooth
perfect
for
the
beginner
dod
darkman
the
significant
problems
we
face
can
not
be
solved
at
the
same
level
of
thinking
we
were
at
when
we
created
them
