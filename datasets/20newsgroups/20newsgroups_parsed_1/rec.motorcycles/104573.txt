t
was
very
nice
out
yesterday
in
the
burgh
so
i
rode
my
bike
to
my
gynecologist
appointment
when
he
came
in
to
do
the
exam
he
noticed
my
helmet
sitting
on
a
chair
he
got
excited
and
picked
it
up
and
started
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
about
bikes
and
dealers
in
the
area
and
the
msf
course
apparently
he
rode
a
friends
for
a
while
years
ago
and
recently
the
bug
to
ride
caught
him
again
needless
to
say
i
had
never
before
talked
about
bikes
so
much
in
such
a
position
if
ya
know
what
i
mean

massacre
of
suns
by
evenings
