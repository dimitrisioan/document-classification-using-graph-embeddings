ok
for
a
novice
question
is
there
anything
that
will
clean
a
faceshield
and
also
remove
abrasions
so
that
one
can
see
through
it
better
what
you
want
are
meguiars
mirror
glaze
plastic
polish
and
plastic
cleaner
they
are
very
mild
abrasives
meant
to
remove
scratches
from
plastic
for
fine
scratches
just
use
the
polish
for
bigger
ones
start
with
the
cleaner
and
finish
with
the
polish
the
stuff
is
bucks
per
bottle
at
most
auto
or
motorcycle
parts
stores
dont
choke
over
the
price
too
much
since
both
bottles
will
probably
last
you
years
the
stuff
works
great
on
plastic
watch
crystals
and
compact
discs
too
