re
drinking
and
riding
so
you
cant
ride
the
bike
but
you
will
drive
truck
home
the
judgement
and
motor
skills
needed
to
pilot
a
moto
are
not
required
in
a
cage
this
scares
the
sht
out
of
me
this
is
a
piece
of
psychology
its
essential
for
any
long
term
biker
to
understand
people
do
not
think
if
i
do
this
will
someone
else
suffer
they
assess
things
purely
on
if
i
do
this
will
i
suffer
this
is
a
vital
concept
in
bikecage
interaction
