the
next
question
is
how
shall
i
carry
the
thing
on
the
bike
given
the
metal
frame
and
all
i
have
a
big
backrest
approx
high
and
was
hoping
that
i
would
be
able
to
bungee
cord
the
backpack
to
the
backrest
any
one
have
any
experiences
on
such
experimentation
put
the
pack
on
the
pillion
and
bungee
it
to
the
backrest
if
that
is
not
possible
then
you
should
be
able
to
bungee
it
behind
the
backrest
just
make
sure
it
doesnt
bend
or
break
anything
like
the
rear
fender
or
turnsignals
bill
ranck
cars
making
a
sudden
uturn
are
the
most
dangerous
they
may
cut
you
off
entirely
blocking
the
whole
roadway
and
leaving
you
no
place
to
go
