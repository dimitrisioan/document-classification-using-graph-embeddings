says
i
guess
im
out
of
touch
but
what
exactly
is
the
ducati
a
vtwin
desmo
or
is
it
that
halfavtwin
with
the
balance
weight
where
the
nd
cylinder
would
go
a
second
for
a
isnt
bad
at
all
sorry
i
should
have
been
more
specific
the
ss
ran
the
quater
in
the
last
small
vtwin
duc
we
got
in
the
us
and
the
is
a
pantah
based
vtwin
was
the
sl
pantah
and
it
ran
a
creditable
modern
carbs
and
what
not
should
put
the
in
the
high
s
at
btw
fzr
s
ran
mid
s
and
the
latest
crop
of
japanese
s
will
out
run
that
its
hard
to
remember
but
but
a
new
goof
will
clobber
an
old
kz
handily
both
in
top
end
and
rollon
technology
stands
still
for
noone
not
too
hard
to
remember
i
bought
a
gs
new
in
it
was
rd
place
in
the
speed
wars
behind
the
cbx
xs
eleven
with
a
mile
and
horses
that
wouldnt
even
make
a
good
these
days
then
again
i
paid
for
it
so
technology
isnt
the
only
thing
thats
changed
of
course
id
still
rather
ride
the
old
gs
across
three
states
than
any
of
the
s
i
guess
its
an
indication
of
how
much
things
have
changed
that
a
second
didnt
seem
too
far
out
of
line
