after
you
become
a
member
they
will
ship
your
bike
uncrated
to
just
about
anywhere
across
the
fruited
plain
for
a
few
hundred
bucks
i
have
used
this
service
and
have
been
continually
pleased
they
usually
only
take
a
few
days
for
the
whole
thing
and
you
do
not
have
to
prepare
the
bike
in
any
way
other
than
draining
the
gas
not
to
mention
that
it
is
about
of
the
normal
shipping
costs
by
the
time
you
crate
a
bike
and
ship
it
with
another
company
you
can
pay
around
