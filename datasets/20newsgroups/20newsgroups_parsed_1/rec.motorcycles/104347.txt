in
heavy
traffic
i
slow
down
a
bit
mostly
so
i
have
more
buffer
zone
in
front
to
balance
the
minimal
buffer
behind
but
i
also
often
find
that
the
jerk
behind
will
notice
traffic
moving
faster
in
other
lanes
switch
into
one
of
them
and
pass
me
which
is
fine
because
then
i
can
keep
a
better
eye
on
the
jerk
from
behind
while
looking
ahead
rather
than
from
in
front
while
splitting
my
attention
between
ahead
and
the
mirrors
this
is
pretty
damned
complicated
i
just
make
a
back
off
motion
with
my
handarm
and
the
second
or
third
time
even
the
most
braindead
cager
backs
off
if
they
dont
back
off
then
i
find
a
way
to
get
the
hell
out
of
there
the
cager
is
either
psychotic
drunk
or
just
a
complete
asshole
in
any
case
i
dont
want
to
be
anywhere
near
and
especially
not
in
front
