trying
to
figure
out
a
way
to
put
a
halogen
beam
on
my
cbt
are
nhthere
any
easy
ways
to
do
this
ie
a
slipin
bulb
replacement
no
the
honda
s
employed
a
sealed
beam
which
was
not
interchangeable
with
anything
else
so
far
as
i
could
ever
tell
ive
owned
two
s
over
the
years
and
that
was
always
one
of
my
biggest
nits
im
not
sure
how
far
standardisation
went
but
on
two
of
my
bikes
the
gsb
and
i
think
the
gtm
i
was
able
to
pop
a
cibie
insert
directly
into
the
original
housing
held
in
by
those
roughly
wshaped
springs
the
inserts
used
w
halogen
bulbs
and
were
great
although
mr
bill
later
indicates
that
this
may
be
too
much
of
a
drain
on
your
charging
system
