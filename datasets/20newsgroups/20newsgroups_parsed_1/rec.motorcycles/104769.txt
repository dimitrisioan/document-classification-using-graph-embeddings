what
worked
for
me
on
my
rd
was
to
lean
towards
the
dog
as
i
modulated
throttle
to
keep
my
ankle
just
ahead
of
his
teeth
after
a
few
seconds
of
warm
pipe
firmly
wedged
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
his
face
sideways
to
see
what
was
so
warm
and
got
his
mouthnosemuzzle
burned
on
the
pipes
one
yip
and
he
veered
away
never
to
chase
me
again
nice
ridin
tex
i
use
the
california
dmv
recommended
technique
slow
as
you
aproach
said
dog
and
wick
it
up
as
you
pass
ive
often
contemplated
putting
the
boot
in
said
dogs
muzzle
as
i
open
the
throttle
but
have
never
tried
that
i
figgure
the
impact
would
unballance
me
and
id
dump
the
bike
a
bicycling
technique
ive
employed
was
to
use
my
frame
mounted
tire
pump
to
fend
off
dog
attacks
on
one
occasion
i
was
attacked
by
a
pack
of
four
dogs
at
once
while
peddaling
up
a
steep
hill
i
lost
my
right
sock
but
no
blood
i
complained
to
the
local
animal
control
department
after
complaining
to
the
owner
of
the
dogs
to
no
affect
about
the
dogs
no
more
dogs
no
more
attacks
the
telephone
worked
much
better
than
the
tire
pump
