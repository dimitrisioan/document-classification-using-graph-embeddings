hello
there
can
anyone
who
has
handson
experience
on
riding
the
yamaha
vmax
pls
kindly
comment
on
its
handling
some
guy
came
to
the
omrra
race
school
last
weekend
with
number
plates
on
his
vmax
he
didnt
get
more
than
practice
laps
in
before
he
pushed
the
frame
too
hard
and
it
drove
him
into
the
guard
rail
on
the
back
straight
btw
the
rider
was
conscious
and
semicoherent
when
the
ambulance
carted
him
off
thats
all
i
know
i
hate
to
pick
on
someone
who
may
have
been
seriously
injured
lets
hope
not
but
semicoherent
sounds
like
a
good
description
of
someone
who
shows
up
at
the
track
w
a
vmax
in
the
first
place
what
does
that
make
me
for
showing
up
with
an
old
interceptor
with
worse
brakes
and
handling
due
to
bent
frame
than
a
vmax
and
i
didnt
even
uh
well
i
was
more
than
semicoherent
when
the
ambulance
uh
nevermind
axel
