off
reading
all
you
folks
things
to
do
to
illegally
parked
cars
made
me
wonder
whos
going
to
carry
cinder
blocks
on
a
bike
or
is
ready
to
do
serious
damage
key
carvings
etc
to
a
cage
then
i
had
an
ideachain
lube
isnt
just
for
chains
anymore
it
seems
more
reasonable
to
me
no
permanent
damage
but
lots
of
work
to
get
off
dont
ask
me
how
i
know
use
it
anywhere
the
windshield
the
door
handles
in
the
keyhole
etc
what
a
nasty
mood
im
in
