bzzzzt
it
was
me
until
i
discovered
my
sr
touring
bike
has
a
nifty
little
cache
on
it
for
things
like
coins
or
lipstick
the
new
duc
ss
doesnt
so
ill
have
to
go
back
to
carrying
my
lipstick
in
my
jacket
pocket
life
is
so
hard
am
i
the
only
denizen
who
thinks
that
the
natural
look
is
the
best
look
the
thought
of
kissing
that
waxy
shit
smeared
all
over
a
womans
lips
is
a
definite
turnoff
so
does
clear
lipstickchapsticketc
fit
under
the
natural
look
or
the
waxy
shit
category
i
wear
something
on
my
lips
to
keep
them
from
drying
out
kissing
dry
cracked
parched
lips
isnt
too
fun
either
agreed
but
yes
chapstick
fits
under
the
waxy
shit
category
although
ive
noticed
that
stealing
annettes
chapstick
after
shes
applied
it
kept
my
lips
from
cracking
this
past
winter
like
they
have
in
all
previous
winters
sighthe
price
i
must
pay
not
that
ill
ever
be
kissing
beth
or
noemi
not
if
tom
has
anything
to
say
about
it
you
wont
noemi
speaks
for
herself
so
does
my
darling
annette
okay
i
guess
you
can
ready
the
barf
bags
now
