does
the
amount
of
exhaust
allowed
to
leave
the
engine
through
the
exhaust
pipe
make
that
much
of
a
difference
the
amount
of
airfuel
mixture
that
a
cylender
sucks
in
tries
to
suck
in
depends
on
the
speed
of
the
piston
when
it
goes
down
and
the
pressure
in
the
cylinder
at
the
end
of
the
exhaust
stroke
with
a
poor
exhaust
system
this
pressure
may
be
above
atmospheric
with
a
pipe
that
scavenges
well
this
may
be
substantially
below
atmospheric
this
effect
will
vary
with
rpm
depending
on
the
tune
of
the
pipe
some
pipes
combined
with
large
valve
overlap
can
actually
reverse
the
intake
flow
and
blow

the

my
question
is
which
one
provides
more
resistence
as
far
as
the
engine
is
conserned
resistance
that
the
exhaust
provides
or
the
resistance
that
results
from
the
bike
trying
to
push
itself
and
the
rider
two
completely
different
things
the
state
of
the
pipe
determines
how
much
power
the
motor
can
make
the

of

youre

well
i
for

am
so
very
glad
that
i
have

all
