also
is
there
a
law
or
something
that
requires
nyc
to
keep
its
street
empty
of
potholes
greater
than
a
certain
depth
i
rather
my
bike
hahahahahaahahha
whahwuhuhahuah
thats
a
good
one
really
stop
i
cant
breathe
bite
your
tongue
those
of
us
who
actually
ride
in
nyc
on
a
daily
basis
could
not
live
without
those
potholes
itll
ruin
the
flavor
its
not
enough
just
to
dodge
taxis
buses
pedistrians
bicycle
messengers
and
bdis
on
a
block
by
block
basis
those
potholes
always
makes
for
that
sudden
randomness
that
makes
it
all
so
much
fun
besides
where
else
can
you
think
of
that
allows
you
to
constantly
test
your
panic
braking
shocks
and
dirtriding
abilities
all
on
city
streets
you
smooth
asphalt
canyon
carvers
dont
know
what
youre
missing
i
was
laughing
about
the
law
part
ive
driven
thru
sohomanahattan
i
know
what
youre
talking
bout
not
that
durham
nc
is
any
better
well
maybe
a
little
bit
anyway
but
the
nc
dot
takes
more
money
from
road
taxes
and
puts
it
in
their
own
pockets
and
into
the
pockets
of
the
guys
building
the
large
condos
that
need
their
own
roads
than
they
do
back
into
fixing
roads
but
hey
the
local
paper
did
a
report
of
this
last
summer
and
boy
am
i
glad
i
dont
work
for
the
dot
cause
they
got
shat
on
bigtimewonder
who
lost
their
jobs
ed
got
any
idea
andy
infante
you
can
listen
to
what
everybody
says
but
the
fact
remains
bmw
r
that
youve
got
to
get
out
there
and
do
the
thing
yourself

nothing
to
do
with
anyone
else
