i
was
wondering
if
anybody
knows
anything
about
a
yamaha
seca
turbo
im
considering
buying
a
used
seca
turbo
for
canadian
us
with
km
on
the
odo
this
will
be
my
first
bike
any
comments
dont
just
nab
it
pounce
on
it
these
are
fairly
rare
bikes
and
they
are
more
than
adequate
for
putting
a
big
brown
stripe
in
your
shorts
does
a
mph
power
wheelie
appeal
to
you
i
thought
it
would
only
really
bad
things
the
stock
clutch
isnt
up
to
the
task
barnett
can
take
care
of
this
the
back
tire
wears
quickly
gee
wonder
why
and
the
induction
system
is
a
bear
to
work
on
later
