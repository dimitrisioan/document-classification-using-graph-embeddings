i
am
looking
for
a
new
tank
bag
now
and
i
wondered
if
you
as
follow
fj
owners
could
make
some
suggestions
as
to
what
has
and
has
not
worked
for
you
if
there
is
already
a
file
on
this
i
apologize
for
asking
and
will
gladly
accept
any
flames
that
are
blown
my
way
ive
got
a
belstaff
tankbag
on
my
fj
and
it
aint
too
good
its
difficult
to
fix
it
securely
cos
of
the
the
tankfairingsidepanel
layout
and
also
with
the
bars
on
full
lock
the
bag
touches
the
handlebar
switches
so
you
get
the
horn
on
full
left
lock
and
the
starter
motor
on
full
right
if
i
was
buying
another
i
think
id
go
for
a
magnetic
one
