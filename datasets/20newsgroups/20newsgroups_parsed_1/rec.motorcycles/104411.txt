insurance
companies
sure
seem
to
go
for
nofault
coverage
since
the
majority
of
accidents
are
the
cagers
fault
doesnt
this
imply
that
we
would
have
to
pay
much
higher
rates
under
a
nofault
system
with
a
carsonly
system
it
seems
to
make
sense
on
the
surface
take
the
legal
costs
out
of
the
system
but
it
looks
like
motorcyclists
would
get
screwed
yup
unfortunately
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
cost
of
insurance
does
not
go
down
with
no
fault
the
crappiest
drivers
make
out
like
bandits
because
they
no
longer
have
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
paying
for
insurance
that
they
have
boosted
in
price
for
themselves
by
being
crappy
drivers
the
good
drivers
now
pay
through
the
nose
to
spread
the
cost
of
the
crappy
drivers
actions
and
thats
not
fair
any
plan
that
caps
rates
for
crappy
drivers
is
inherently
a
piece
of
shit
because
the
rest
of
us
end
up
paying
more
any
plan
that
uses
speeding
tickets
as
a
basis
for
raising
rates
is
also
a
piece
of
shit
as
it
is
based
upon
the
lie
that
faster
drivers
are
inherently
less
safe
than
slower
drivers
and
the
nhtsa
disproved
that
two
years
ago
now
later
