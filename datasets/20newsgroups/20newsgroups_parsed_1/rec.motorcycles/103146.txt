ill
put
in
a
vote
for
the

a
bike
takes
a
lot
of
involvement
and
i
for
one
do
not
want
any
accident
to
be
my
fault
i
remember
one
artical
where
the
reviewer
tried
the
radio
on
the
bike
not
having
had
one
on
any
of
his
he
stated
that
the
bike
tended
to
go
faster
when
the
music
was
good
i
agree
having
felt
like
this
my
self
and
this
was
not
a
physical
imparement
like
drinking
just
the
emotional
lift
from
