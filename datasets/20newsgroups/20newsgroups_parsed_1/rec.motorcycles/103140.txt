identify
this
bike
for
me
ok
i
saw
a
bike
today
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
lets
begin
by
saying
that
its
whole
rear
end
was
definately
hawk
additionally
it
had
a
cbrrr
style
tank
full
fairing
and
only
a
tach
now
at
first
i
thought
it
was
an
rc
a
hawk
modified
by
two
brothers
racing
but
i
did
not
think
that
they
made
this
huge
tank
for
it
additionally
the
gauges
were
certainly
not
from
a
hawk
they
looked
much
more
like
rr
gauges
overall
the
bike
looked
like
a
rr
except
for
the
rear
singlesided
swingarm
and
wheel
there
were
straight
from
the
hawk
so
what
did
i
see
ps
for
any
of
you
boulder
doders
i
saw
it
parked
at
the
engineering
center
today
it
is
white
with
light
green
stripes
