if
we
are
only
talking
about
stroke
i
think
i
can
understand
exhaust
pulse
affect
in
a
stroke
the
intake
valve
is
closed
on
the
exhaust
stroke
and
the
gas
is
pushed
out
by
the
cyclinder
i
guess
there
is
some
gas
compression
that
may
affect
the
amount
pushed
out
but
the
limiting
factor
seems
to
be
the
header
pipe
and
not
the
canister
meaning
would
gases
so
far
down
the
line
the
canister
really
have
an
effect
on
the
exhaust
stroke
do
the
gases
really
compress
that
much
for
discussion
purposes
i
will
ignore
dynamic
effects
like
pulses
in
the
exhaust
pipe
and
try
to
paint
a
useful
mental
picture
unless
an
engine
is
supercharged
the
pressure
available
to
force
air
into
the
intake
tract
is
atmospheric
at
the
time
the
intake
valve
is
opened
the
pressure
differential
available
to
move
air
is
only
the
difference
between
the
combustion
chamber
pressure
left
over
after
the
exhaust
stroke
and
atmospheric
as
the
piston
decends
on
the
intake
stroke
combustion
chamber
pressure
is
decreased
allowing
atmospheric
pressure
to
move
more
air
into
the
intake
tract
at
no
time
does
the
pressure
ever
become
negative
or
even
approach
a
good
vacuum
at
the
time
of
the
exhaust
valve
closing
the
pressure
in
the
combustion
chamber
is
essentially
the
pressure
of
the
exhaust
system
up
to
the
first
major
flow
restriction
the
muffler
note
that
the
volume
of
gas
that
must
flow
through
the
exhaust
is
much
larger
than
the
volume
that
must
flow
through
the
intake
because
of
the
temperature
difference
and
the
products
of
combustion
in
the
last
years
the
japanese
manufacturers
have
started
paying
attention
to
exhaust
and
intake
tuning
in
pursuit
of
almighty
horsepower
at
this
point
in
time
on
highperformance
bikes
substitution
of
an
aftermarket
freeflow
air
filter
will
have
almost
zero
affect
on
performance
because
the
stock
intake
system
flows
very
well
anyway
substitution
of
an
aftermarket
exhaust
system
will
make
very
little
difference
unless
in
general
the
new
exhaust
system
is
much
louder
than
the
stocker
on
older
bikes
exhaust
backpressure
was
the
dominating
factor
if
freeflowing
air
filters
were
substituted
very
little
difference
was
noted
unless
a
freeflowing
exhaust
system
was
installed
as
well
in
general
an
engine
can
be
visualized
as
an
air
pump
at
any
given
rpm
anything
that
will
cause
the
engine
to
pump
more
air
be
it
on
the
intake
or
exhaust
side
will
cause
it
to
produce
more
horsepower
pumping
more
air
will
require
recalibration
