with
a
hostile
dog
or
one
which
you
repeatedly
encounter
stronger
measures
may
be
necessary
this
is
the
face
off
first
and
there
is
very
important
make
sure
you
never
face
off
a
dog
on
his
territory
face
him
off
on
the
road
not
on
his
driveway
if
necessary
have
a
large
stick
rolled
up
newspaper
etc
something
the
beast
will
understand
is
something
that
will
hurt
him
stand
your
ground
then
slowly
advance
your
mental
attitude
is
that
you
are
very
angry
and
are
going
to
dispense
terrible
punishment
the
larger
the
dog
the
greater
your
anger
this
tactic
depends
for
its
effectiveness
on
the
dogs
conformance
to
a
psychological
norm
that
may
not
actually
apply
to
a
particular
dog
ive
tried
it
with
some
success
before
but
it
wont
work
on
a
charlie
manson
dog
or
one
thats
really
really
stupid
a
large
irish
setter
taught
me
this
in
my
yard
apparently
his
territory
one
day
im
sure
he
was
playing
a
game
with
me
the
game
was
probably
kill
the
very
angry
neighbor
before
he
can
dispense
the
terrible
punishment
