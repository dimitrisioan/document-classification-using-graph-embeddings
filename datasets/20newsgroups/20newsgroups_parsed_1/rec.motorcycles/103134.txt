riding
what
is
a
general
rule
of
thumb
for
sobriety
and
cycling
couple
hours
after
you
feel
sober
what
or
should
i
just
work
with
if
i
drink
tonight
i
dont
ride
until
tomorrow
even
a
half
a
beer
will
increase
your
confidence
while
slugging
your
reactions
and
judgement
not
much
maybe
but
its
hard
enough
to
stay
alive
out
there
for
any
length
of
time
without
stacking
the
odds
ill
not
ride
after
any
