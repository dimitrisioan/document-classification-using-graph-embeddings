ye
gods
that
would
be
the
end
of
civilization
as
we
know
it
why
not
ford
owns
astonmartin
and
jaguar
general
motors
owns
lotus
and
vauxhall
rover
is
only
owned
by
honda
yes
its
a
minor
blasphemy
that
us
companies
would
on
the
likes
of
am
jaguar
or
sob
lotus
its
outright
sacrilege
for
rr
to
have
nonbritish
ownership
its
a
fundamental
thing
i
think
there
is
a
legal
clause
in
the
rr
name
regardless
of
who
owns
it
it
must
be
a
british
companyowner
ie
ba
can
sell
the
company
but
not
the
name
i
dont
believe
that
ba
have
anything
to
do
with
rr
its
a
seperate
company
from
the
rr
aeroengine
company
i
think
that
the
government
own
a
stake
unfortunately
they
owned
a
stake
of
jaguar
too
until
they
decided
to
make
a
quick
buck
and
sold
it
to
ford
bastards
this
is
definitely
the
ultimate
