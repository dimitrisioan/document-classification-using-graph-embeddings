i
have
a
cheap
solar
charger
that
i
keep
in
my
car
i
purchased
it
via
some
mail
order
catalog
when
the
year
old
battery
in
my
oldsmobile
would
run
down
during
summer
when
i
was
riding
my
bike
more
than
driving
my
car
knowing
id
be
selling
the
car
in
a
year
or
so
i
purchased
the
charger
believe
it
or
not
the
thing
worked
the
battery
held
a
charge
and
energetically
started
the
car
many
times
after
or
weeks
of
just
sitting
eventually
i
had
to
purchase
a
new
battery
anyway
because
the
winter
sun
wasnt
strong
enough
due
to
its
low
angle
i
think
i
paid
or
for
the
charger
there
are
more
powerful
more
expensive
ones
but
i
purchased
the
cheapest
one
i
could
find
ive
never
used
it
on
the
bike
because
i
have
an
ez
charger
on
it
and
keep
it
plugged
in
all
the
time
the
bike
is
garaged
