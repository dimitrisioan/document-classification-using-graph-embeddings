i
would
be
scared
of
trying
to
fit
the
one
piece
when
i
got
my
two
piece
i
got
the
jacket
in
and
the
pants
in
just
due
to
my
manlyman
of
an
athletic
build
kind
of
thing
no
laughing
please
seriously
im
not
trim
and
the
pants
would
have
been
way
too
big
also
i
dont
think

does
provide
better
protection

im
wrong

dont
fear

afternoon
when
im
still
asleep

about
