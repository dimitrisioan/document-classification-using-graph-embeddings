from
some
fantastic
skiing
in
colorado
and
put
the
battery
back
in
the
fxstc
cleaned
the
plugs
opened
up
the
petcock
waited
a
minute
hit
the
starter
and
bingo
it
started
up
like
a
charm
spent
a
restless
night
anticipating
the
first
ride
du
saison
and
off
i
went
this
morning
to
get
my
state
inspection
done
now
my
bike
is
stock
so
far
except
for
hd
slashcut
pipes
and
therein
lies
the
rub
the
hd
slash
cut
or
baloney
cuts
as
some
call
them
are
not
stock
mufflers
theyre
sold
for
offroad
use
only
and
are
much
louder
than
stock
mufflers
