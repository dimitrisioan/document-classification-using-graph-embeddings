generic
bike
riders
actually
seem
to
raise
the
hand
entirely
off
the
handlebar
and
wave
it
around
so
its
easy
to
tell
when
theyre
waving
and
doders
are
easily
recognized
by
their
own
special
wave
pay
attention
and
ill
tell
you
how
to
do
it
hold
your
left
hand
out
in
front
of
you
fingers
straight
but
apart
like
a
vase
you
may
also
use
your
right
hand
if
you
have
a
throttle
lock
or
are
stopped
bring
your
fingertips
and
thumb
together
touch
and
open
back
to
the
starting
position
while
you
are
doing
this
move
your
hand
slowly
to
the
left
do
it
gracefully
and
with
a
waving
motion
you
are
now
imitating
a
squid
propelling
itself
about
underwater
probably
in
search
of
food
drink
squids
of
the
appropriate
sexual
orientation
or
other
squids
to
go
riding
with
lissa
