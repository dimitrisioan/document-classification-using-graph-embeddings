stuff
chopped
here
is
the
part
that
concerned
me
the
hg
and
those
shop
personel
that
were
not
busy
with
customers
went
back
out
where
said
hg
members
fired
up
their
rides
and
did
the
obligatory
reving
up
of
those
beasts
at
this
point
one
decided
to
see
how
much
rubber
a
katana
could
deposit
in
the
drive
squids
i
thought
to
myself
but
i
was
appalled
that
the
salesdroidsmanager
not
only
condoned
this
behavior
but
encourged
it
to
the
point
were
they
were
betting
how
long
he
could
keep
it
up
and
egged
him
on
to
pull
a
wheely
as
he
rode
off
onto
a
busy
street
around
rush
hour
the
girl
that
was
riding
pillion
on
another
bike
seemed
rather
hormonal
about
this
display
and
urged
her
pilot
to
quickly
catch
up
the
others
followed
making
sure
there
kerkers
could
be
heard
as
well
as
felt
um
you
got
ta
understand
these
salesdroids
as
you
call
them
they
look
at
it
this
way
burn
lotsa
tire
make
lotsa
money
im
sure
s
he
knew
how
stupid
the
hg
was
would
you
seriously
stop
them
from
burning
off
a
seasons
worth
of
tire
the
squids
probably
would
buy
metzelers
or
some
good
low
profile
tire
anyhow
yep
them
droids
sure
a
sneaky
bastards
