are
you
mshaving
any
fun
sure
ive
never
been
much
of
a
racerboy
as
anybody
whos
attended
the
minibike
spectacular
can
attest
i
get
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
in
riding
fast
yet
now
so
fast
as
to
be
overly
concerned
about
not
being
able
to
maintain
a
clean
line
and
while
im
still
known
to
slide
the
occasional
tire
i
much
prefer
to
stay
just
to
the
sticky
side
of
that
line
ive
found
that
i
dont
heal
as
well
as
i
used
to
in
days
of
yore
btw
hows
the
knee
mrbanyway
am
i
more
likely
to
catch
a
than
a
not
necessarily
mrbtires
road
surface
and
rider
ability
are
a
much
more
important
criteria
msactually
big
horsepower
is
just
as
likely
to
get
you
out
of
trouble
mswhen
it
starts
to
drift
as
your
puny
body
mass
pushing
on
stuff
a
well
msplaced
push
from
or
horsepower
can
do
a
lot
to
straighten
or
change
msin
a
beneficial
way
the
trajectory
of
the
bikerider
system
thats
a
quite
true
another
plus
for
a
bike
