hello
everyone
im
new
to
motorcycles
so
no
flames
please
i
dont
have
my
bike
yet
so
i
need
a
few
pieces
of
information
i
only
have
about
to
work
with
so
that
would
have
to
cover
everything
bike
helmet
anything
else
that
im
too
ignorant
to
know
i
need
to
buy
what
is
buying
a
bike
going
to
do
to
my
insurance
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parents
have
been
taking
care
of
my
insurance
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehensive
list
of
costs
that
buying
a
motorcycle
is
going
to
insure
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
makes
a
difference
any
recommendations
on
what
i
should
buywhere
i
should
look
for
it
in
dc
as
i
imagine
it
is
in
every
other
state
ok
ok
were
not
a
state
were
not
bitter
you
take
the
written
test
first
and
then
get
a
learners
permit
however
im
wondering
how
one
goes
about
learning
to
ride
the
bike
proficiently
enough
so
as
to
a
get
a
liscence
and
b
not
kill
oneself
i
dont
know
anyone
with
a
bike
who
could
teach
me
and
the
most
advice
ive
heard
is
either
do
you
live
near
a
field
or
do
you
have
a
friend
with
a
pickup
truck
the
answers
to
both
of
which
are
no
do
i
just
ride
around
my
neighborhood
and
hope
for
the
best
i
kind
of
live
in
a
residential
area
but
its
not
suburbs
its
still
the
big
city
and
im
about
a
mile
from
downtown
so
that
doesnt
seem
too
viable
any
stories
on
how
you
all
learned
thanks
for
any
replies
in
advance
