pretty
much
decided
never
to
get
this
particular
model
unless
he
or
someone
else
wants
to
change
the

to
the

was
used
to
for
his
honda

is
just
a
design
flawoversight
in
my
eyes
sure
dont
know
what
bike
was
being
worked
on
but
it
sure
wasnt
a
virago
ive
owned
both
the

and
you
can
do
the
filter

has
to
be
removed
