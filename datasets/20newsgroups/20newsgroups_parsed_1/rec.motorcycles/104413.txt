the
rider
pilot
of
practically
every
riceburner
ive
passed
recently
has
waved
to
me
and
im
wondering
if
it
will
last
could
they
simply
be
overexuberant
that
their
burners
have
been
removed
from
winter
mothballs
and
the
novelty
will
soon
dissipate
perhaps
the
gray
beard
that
sprouted
since
the
last
rice
season
makes
them
think
im
a
friendly
old
fart
that
deserves
a
wave
maybethen
again
did
you
get
rid
of
that
hd
of
yorn
and
buy
a
rice
rocket
of
your
own
that
would
certainly
explain
the
friendlinessunless
you
maybe
had
a
piece
of
toilet
paper
stuck
on
the
bottom
of
your
boot
