just
before
arriving
at
a
toll
booth
i
switch
the
hazards
on
i
do
thisto
warn
other
motorists
that
i
will
be
taking
longer
than
the
seconds
to
make
the
transaction
my
question
is
this
a
goodbad
thing
to
do
this
sounds
like
a
very
good
thing
to
do
ill
second
that
in
addition
i
find
my
hazards
to
be
more
often
used
than
my
horn
at
speeds
below
mph
on
the
interstates
quite
common
in
mountains
with
trucks
some
states
require
flashers
in
rural
areas
flashers
let
the
guy
behind
you
know
there
is
a
tractor
with
a
rather
large
implement
behind
it
in
the
way
use
them
whenever
you
need
to
communicate
that
things
will
deviate
from
the
norm
