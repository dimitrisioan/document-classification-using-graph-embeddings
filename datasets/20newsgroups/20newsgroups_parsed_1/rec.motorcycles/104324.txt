youre
welcome
to
give
any
of
the
ones
i
have
a
try
as
for
the
gargoyles
if
you
want
mine
you
can
have
em
i
think
the
bridge
of
my
nose
holds
them
too
far
from
my
face
same
deal
for
the
two
of
my
friends
who
tried
them
for
people

helmet

sorry
if

fit
you
well

took
my
complaint
personally
yes
the
oakleys
are
much
more
desirable
squid
attire
also
the
gargoyles
arent
that
ugly
even
in
my
opinion
or
i
wouldnt
have
tried
them
