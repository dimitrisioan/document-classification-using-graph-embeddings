how
do
the
helmetless
do
it
um
the
same
way
people
do
it
on
horseback
not
as
fast
and
they
would
probably
enjoy
eating
bugs
anyway
every
bit
as
fast
as
a
dirtbike
in
the
right
terrain
and
we
eat
flies
thank
you
who
mentioned
dirtbikes
were
talking
highway
speeds
here
if
you
go
mph
on
your
dirtbike
then
feel
free
to
contribute
jeeps
youre
supposed
to
keep
the
windscreen
up
then
why
does
it
go
down
because
it
wouldnt
be
a
jeep
if
it
didnt
a
friend
of
mine
just
bought
one
and
it
has
more
warning
stickers
than
those
little
wheelers
i
guess
thats
becuase
its
a
big
wheeler
anyway
its
written
in
about
ten
places
that
the
windshield
should
remain
up
at
all
times
and
it
looks
like
theyve
made
it
a
pain
to
put
it
down
anyway
from
what
he
says
to
be
fair
i
do
admit
that
it
would
be
a
similar
matter
to
drive
a
windscreenless
jeep
on
the
highway
as
for
bikers
they
may
participate
in
this
discussion
but
theyre
probably
few
and
far
between
so
i
maintain
that
this
topic
is
of
interest
primarily
to
bikers
snow
skis
no
bugs
and
most
poeple
who
go
fast
wear
goggles
so
do
most
helmetless
motorcyclists
notice
how
ed
picked
on
the
more
insignificant
the
lower
case
part
of
the
two
parts
of
the
statement
besides
around
here
it
is
quite
rare
to
see
bikers
wear
goggles
on
the
street
its
either
full
face
with
shield
or
open
face
with
either
nothing
or
aviator
sunglasses
my
experience
of
bicycling
with
contact
lenses
and
sunglasses
says
that
nonwraparound
sunglasses
do
almost
nothing
to
keep
the
crap
out
of
ones
eyes
the
question
still
stands
how
do
cruiser
riders
with
no
or
negligible
helmets
stand
being
on
the
highway
at
mph
on
buggy
summer
evenings
helmetless
goggleless
ok
ok
fine
whatever
you
say
but
lets
make
some
attmept
to
stick
to
the
point
ive
been
out
on
the
road
where
i
had
to
stop
every
half
hour
to
clean
my
shield
there
were
so
many
bugs
and
my
jacket
would
be
a
bloodsplattered
mess
and
id
see
guys
with
shorty
helmets
no
goggles
long
beards
and
tight
tshirts
merrily
cruising
along
on
bikes
with
no
windscreens
lets
be
really
specific
this
time
so
that
even
ed
understands
does
anbody
think
that
splattering
bugs
with
ones
face
is
fun
or
are
there
other
reasons
to
do
it
image
laziness
to
make
a
point
about
freedom
of
bug
splattering
ive
bike
