now
probably
have
chain
final
drive
which
as
we
all
know
is
less
efficient
and
has
higher
maintenance

the

the
thread
when
did
you
go
out
and
change
the
laws
of
physics
according
to
some
numbers
i
used

shaft
drive
is

efficient
while
chain
drive
is
closer
to
seems
to
me
that
this
makes
chain
drive
more
efficient
hmmmmm
and
granted
shaft
has
a
