bub
pipes
live
free
with
variable
loudness
after
failing
my
state
of
new
hampshire
noise
gestapo
test
with
my
hd
slash
cut
pipes
i
installed
my
new
bubs
which
i
had
been
planning
to
do
anyway
went
to
a
different
in
spection
station
and
passed
with
no
problem
at
about
db
two
points
first
i
dont
think
the
first
dude
did
the
noise
test
correctly
holding
the
meter
close
to
his
body
probably
caused
a
high
reading
and
doing
it
inside
the
garage
with
the
door
closed
undoubtedly
enhanced
the
db
level
so
if
any
other
nh
riders
need
to
get
this
done
make
sure
the
inspection
is
done
outdoors
with
the
meter
held
well
away
from
the
body
second
these
bub
pipes
are
bloody
terrific
at
low
revs
or
cruising
through
town
they
as
quiet
as
the
stock
pipes
but
have
a
sound
thats
a
more
throaty
purring
rumble
when
you
open
her
up
to
rpm
they
emit
a
wonderfully
satisfying
rumbling
roar
best
of
both
worlds
