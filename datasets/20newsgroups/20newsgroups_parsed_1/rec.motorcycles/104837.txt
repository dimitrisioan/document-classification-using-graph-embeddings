was
privelged
enough
to
experience
my
first
volvo
attack
this
weekend

line

question
no

signal
nothing
we
were
doing
about
mph
and
i
was
following
the
cage
in

of
me
about
sec
back
well
as
said
cage
passes
the
volvo
the
brain
dead
idiot
tm
behind
the
wheel
decides
that
she
doesnt
need
to
wait
for
me
to
pass
also
and
turns
out
perpendicular
across
both
lanes
of
traffic
so
that
she
can
turn
around
so
i
get
on
the
brakes
in
a
effort
to
not
tbone
it
and
the
horn
in
an
effort
to
wake
the
bdi
up
as
she
finishes
the
turn

looks
up
at

with
a
completely
blank
uncomprehending
stare
