do
any
honda
gurus
know
if
i
can
replace
the
the
front
sprocket
on
my
honda
cbk
with
a
slightly
larger
one
i
see
this
as
being
preferable
to
reducing
the
size
of
the
rear
one
thats
a
twincam
right
theres
a
steel
guard
right
next
to
the
sprocket
to
keep
a
broken
chain
from
punching
a
hole
in
the
engine
cases
and
its
needed
theres
probably
not
enough
room
to
fit
a
bigger
sprocket
id
be
inclined
to
take
two
teeth
off
the
rear
for
a
ratio
change
rather
than
adding
one
to
the
front
for
about
if
you
raise
the
overall
gear
ratio
too
much
youll
impair
the
bikes
rideability
because
the
gears
will
be
far
enough
apart
that
there
will
be
only
one
gear
that
provides
adequate
response
at
any
given
speed
