i
am
in
the
market
for
a
bike
and
have
recently
found
a
honda
vrf
at
a
dealership
the
bike
has
about
miles
and
is
around
it
has
had
two
previous
owners
both
employees
of
the
dealership
who
i
have
been
told
took
very
good
care
of
the
bike
i
have
two
questions
is
this
too
many
miles
for
a
bike
i
know
this
would
not
be
many
miles
for
a
car
but
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
life
span
of
bikes
is
this
a
decent
price
i
am
also
unfamilar
with
prices
for
used
bikes
is
there
a
blue
book
for
bikes
like
there
is
for
cars
thanks
for
any
advice
you
can
give
mark
mark
k
is
not
too
many
miles
on
a
vfr
i
sold
my
well
maintained
vfr
with
k
miles
on
it
and
the
engine
was
in
mint
condition
all
that
the
bike
needed
was
steering
head
bearings
and
fork
bushings
and
seals
the
guy
who
bought
it
had
a
mechanic
pull
the
valve
covers
to
look
at
the
top
end
do
a
compression
check
etc
he
confirmed
it
was
mint
as
for
price
seems
a
little
steep
i
bought
my
with
k
miles
on
it
a
year
ago
and
in
absolutely
cherry
condition
for
there
is
a
bluebook
ask
your
bank
or
credit
union
for
the
going
price
ive
seen
a
couple
of
ads
for
vfrs
in
the
dollar
range
they
all
said
low
miles
mint
condition
but
i
didnt
actually
go
look
at
them
a
vfr
is
a
very
sweet
bike
and
will
last
you
forever
if
you
maintain
it
at
all
one
thing
to
look
for
btw
is
a
soft
front
end
if
my
vfr
is
any
indication
at
k
miles
the
fork
springs
were
totally
shot
progressive
springs
fixed
it
right
up
good
luck
