two
questions
that
fascinate
me
check
you
local
blue
light
special
for
a
sale
on
lives
why
are
rednecks
called
rednecks
the
origin
of
the
slang
is
probably
a
reference
to
a
sunburned
neck
often
obtained
while
performing
honest
work
outdoors
the
neck
is
specified
to
distinguish
these
people
whose
shirtprotected
chest
and
back
are
pale
from
the
elitist
wealthy
who
in
their
idiotic
quest
for
darker
skin
pigmentation
as
a
badge
of
leisure
time
overdo
it
and
get
fullbody
sunburns
more
like
those
who
use
their
backs
instead
of
their
minds
to
make
their
living
who
are
usually
ignorant
and
intolerant
of
anything
outside
of
their
group

level

awfully
closed

intolerant
attitude

but
try
a
walk
in
their
shoes

stereotypes
are
usually
of
very
limited
value
ive
seen
as
many
ignorant
selfrighteous
open
minded
new
age
lovers
of
the
great
planet
earth
as
i
have
ignorant
red
necks
i
dont
see
a
correlation
i
dont
believe
that
the
redneck
culture
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
necessarily
inferior
or
superior
to
any
other

got
ta
have
a

im
making
too
much
