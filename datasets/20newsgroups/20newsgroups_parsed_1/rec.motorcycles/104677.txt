i
had
a
bad
experience
w
a
krypto
lock
too
last
year
i
bought
a
krypto
cable
ii
x
long
something
like
that
that
by
all
standards
seemed
like
a
decent
piece
until
i
used
it
anyway
so
in
short
the
cables
seems
to
be
pretty
useless
i
would
guess
the
larger
cable
seems
to
be
a
much
better
unit
ive
got
the
larger
cable
about
inch
in
diameter
actually
i
think
its
larger
about
feet
long
which
coils
into
a
or
inch
coil
with
the
tubular
key
lock
like
the
ulocks
it
has
worked
fine
for
me
for
two
years
now
and
seems
to
me
anyway
that
it
is
very
secure
it
doesnt
have
the
weaknesses
that
the
ulocks
have
other
than
the
liquid
nitrogen
trick
supposedly
is
much
easier
to
store
in
my
tankbag
than
a
ulock
and
more
versatile
i
got
mine
from
one
of
the
mailorder
houses
motorcycle
accessory
warehouse
i
beleive
for
in
combination
with
an
ignition
disable
and
a
couple
of
other
deterrents
all
i
usually
worry
about
is
vandalism
