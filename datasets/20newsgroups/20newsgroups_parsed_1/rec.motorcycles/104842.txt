now
just

here
dod
rule
section
paragraph
clearly
indicates
that
multiple
people
cant
lay
claim
to
a
bike
in
an
obvious
ploy
to
artificially
increase
the
size
of
their
stable
silly
boy
you
read
the
rest
of
that
jibberish
go
back
and
read
rule
so
the
question
of
the
day
is
is
spike
owned
by
a
lady
of
true
class
and
breeding
my
definition
any
woman
who
rides
or
by
tom
the
harely
head
ok
for
the

spike
is
jointly
owned

id
been
half
heartedly
lusting
after
an
sr
for
years
i
had
successfully
avioded
buying
it
by
rationalizing
that
i
didnt
need
to
spend
the
on
it
then
beth
piped
up
with
ill
pay
for
half
of
it
i
was
beaten
i
also
note
that
you
lay
no
claim
to
connie
or
ol
sport
like
i
said
obviously
a
lady
of
discriminating
taste
watch

of
those
are
fine
rides
beth

riding
pillion
on
the
connie
true
the
ol
sport
isnt
her
cup
of

she
cant
get
it
off
of
the

stand
but
she
agrees
that
