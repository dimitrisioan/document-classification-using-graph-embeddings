dropped
my
shoei
rf
off
the
seat
of
my
bike
while
trying
to
rock
it
onto
its
centerstand
chipped
the
heck
out
of
the
paint
on
it
so
i
cheerfully
spent
on
a
bottle
of
testors
model
paint
and
repainted
the
scratches
and
chips
for
minutes
the
question
for
the
day
is
re
passenger
helmets
if
you
dont
know
for
certain
whos
gon
na
ride
with
you
like
say
you
meet
them
at
a
church
meeting
yeah
thats
the
ticket
what
are
some
guidelines
should
i
just
pick
up
another
shoei
in
my
size
to
have
a
backup
helmet
xl
or
should
i
maybe
get
an
inexpensive
one
of
a
smaller
size
to
accomodate
my
likely
passenger
my
rule
of
thumb
is
dont
give
rides
to
people
that
wear
a
bigger
helmet
than
you
unless
your
taste
runs
that
way
or
they
are
familyfriends
gee
reminds
me
of
a
dancer
in
hull
just
over
the
river
from
ottowa
that
i
saw
a
few
years
ago
for
her
i
would
a
bought
a
bigger
helmet
or
even
her
own
bike
or
anything
else
she
wanted
there
are
only
two
types
of
ships
in
the
navy
submarines
and
targets
