just
noticed
that
my
halogen
table
lamp
runs
off
volts
the
big
thinngy
that
plugs
into
the
wall
says
volts
dc
ma
the
question
is
can
i
trickle
charge
the
battery
on
my
cb
with
it
you
could
but
it
would
be
considerably
cheaper
to
spend
or
so
on
a
trickle
charger
from
kmart
venture
or
target
then
it
would
be
to
replace
the
halogen
lamp
power
supply
after
you
fuse
it
trying
to
pump
current
into
the
battery
while
charging
the
charger
should
be
putting
out
around
or
volts
as
well
