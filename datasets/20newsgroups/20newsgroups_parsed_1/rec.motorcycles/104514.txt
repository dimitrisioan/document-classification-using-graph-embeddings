what
does
dwi
stand
for
i
thought
it
was
dui
for
driving
under
influence
so
here
what
does
w
stand
for
driving
while
intoxicated
actually
i
beleive
dwi
normally
means
driving
while
impaired
rather
than
intoxicated
at
least
it
does
in
the
states
ive
lived
in
this
was
changed
here
in
louisiana
when
a
girl
went
to
court
and
won
her
case
by
claiming
to
be
stoned
on
pot
not
intoxicated
on
liquor
one
can
be
imparied
without
necessarily
being
impaired
by
liquor
drugs
not
enough
sleep
being
a
total
moron
all
can
impair
someone
etc
im
surprised
this
got
her
off
the
hook
perhaps
dwi
in
lousiana
is
confined
to
liquor
lets
just
say
it
is
dui
