definition
of
two

that
logic
could
you
describe
two
down
as
the
transition
period
between
two
up
and
coming
to
rest
after
a
high
or
low
side

pretty
good

perhaps
its
referring
to
the
wife
and
child
sitting
in
the
sidecar
next
to
the
oneup
on
the
moto

ever
heard
of
a
game
called
oneuponedown
its
a
drinking
game
for
all
you
older
folx
andy
infante
you
can
listen
to
what
everybody
says
but

fact
remains
bmw

that
youve
got
to
get
out
there
and
do
the
thing
yourself
