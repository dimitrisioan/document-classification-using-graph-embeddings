re
boom
dog
attack
i
eagerly
await
comment
the
ice
princess
next
door
makes
a
habit
of
flooring
her
cage
out
of
the
driveway
when
she
sees
me
coming
probably
only
hits
mph
or
so
i
made
the
mistake
of
waving
to
a
neighbor
she
has
some
sort
of
grudge
now
i
was
riding
downhill
at
mph
on
a
local
backroad
when
a
brown
dobie
came
flashing
through
the
brush
at
well
over
mph
on
an
intercept
course
with
my
front
wheel
the
dog
had
started
out
at
the
top
of
the
hill
when
it
heard
me
and
still
had
a
lead
when
it
hit
the
road
the
dog
was
approaching
from
my
left
and
was
running
full
tilt
to
get
to
my
bike
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
before
i
went
by
rover
was
looking
back
at
me
to
calculate
the
final
trajectory
too
bad
it
didnt
notice
the
car
approaching
at
mph
from
the
other
direction
i
got
a
closeup
view
of
the
our
poor
canine
friends
noggin
careening
off
the
front
bumper
smacking
the
asphalt
and
getting
runover
by
the
front
tire
it
managed
a
pretty
good
yelp
just
before
impact
peripheral
imminent
doom
i
guess
the
driver
didnt
see
me
or
they
probably
would
have
swerved
into
my
lane
the
squeegeed
pup
actually
got
up
and
headed
back
home
but
i
havent
seen
it
since
sniff
sometimes
fate
sees
you
and
smiles
