if
i
remember
correctly
the
reason
that
bmws
come
with
those
expensive
and
relatively
worthless
short
lived
varda
batteries
is
cause
bmw
owns
a
controling
interest
in
that
battery
manufacturer
whats
wrong
with
the
bmw
battery
ive
never
had
problems
and
i
know
numerous
people
that
are
still
using
the
original
battery
in
there
year
old
beemers
the
original
battery
in
an
year
old
bmw
may
be
fine
mine
lasted
many
years
the
replacement
ah
battery
from
bmw
was
a
disaster
the
mechanic
from
comp
acc
told
me
that
ca
would
warantee
replace
the
bad
one
with
a
new
one
of
the
same
evil
bad
batteries
and
tell
the
customer
if
they
have
problems
to
bring
it
back
and
theyd
do
it
again
it
seems
that
many
of
those
ah
batteries
were
doa
neardoa
and
always
unlikely
to
be
going
strong
by
the
end
of
the
warantee
period
on
them
there
was
a
big
batch
of
bad
ones
and
they
replaced
them
with
you
guessed
it
more
bad
ones
bmw
switched
to
a
ah
battery
that
has
more
cold
cranking
amps
even
if
it
has
less
total
juice
i
switched
to
a
yuasa
that
has
even
more
cold
cranking
amps
and
cost
one
third
fewer
dollars
