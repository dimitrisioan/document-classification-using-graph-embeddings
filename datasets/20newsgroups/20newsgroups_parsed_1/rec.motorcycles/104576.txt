obmoto
a
local
dog
used
to
chase
me
all
the
time
really
annoying
i
finally
started
stopping
every
time
hed
chase
me
he
didnt
know
what
to
do
then
and
would
usually
just
slink
off
the
road
after
a
couple
weeks
of
this
he
stopped
chasing
me
altogether
he
would
still
chase
cars
or
other
bikes
though
i
think
he
recognized
me
when
i
went
