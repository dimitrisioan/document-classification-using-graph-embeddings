i
know
theres
already
a
bmw
mailing
list
but
since
its
an
r
bike
only
list
and
limited
to
the
r
r
bikes
as
well
i
believe
the
list
as
chartered
is
geared
toward
rr
gspdst
riders
emphasizing
the
off
road
bikes
but
there
are
numerous
people
on
the
list
with
other
bmw
twins
as
well
as
well
as
the
usual
contingent
of

most
all
boxer
talk
is
welcome
the
main
list
has
about
subscribers
there
is
also
a
digest
version
which
has
about
we
run
about
to
messges
to
day
mostly
technical
with
little
chatter
and
no
flames
subscriptions
can
be
had
via
email
in
the

of
a
message
send
the
command
subscribe
to
for
the
main
list
and
for
the
digest
version
your

address
will
be
used
to
determine
where
you
will
receive
the
mail
it
would
be
a
shame
to
split
boxer
riders
between
different
lists
unless
of
course
the
existing
list
failed
to
meet
the
readers
