quick
question
what
are
the
advantages
of
slipons
versus
your
stock
exhaust
versus
aftermarket
exhaust
systems
i
dont
see
many
people
using
slipons
but
they
are
heavily
advertised
and
half
as
expensive
thanks
dave
cost
is
lower
than
oem
replacements
and
they
weigh
less
also
in
most
instances
you
do
not
have
to
rejet
the
carburetors
to
get
a
little
more
performance
i
replaced
my
oem
canister
with
an
ontario
systems
slip
on
the
midrange
performance
is
better
but
i
also
notice
a
slight
stumble
at
k
rpm
after
talking
to
kaz
yoshima
the
developer
and
manufacturer
of
the
slip
on
he
thinks
i
might
need
larger
pilot
idle
jets
was
not
suppose
to
but
maybe
where
i
live
makes
a
difference
altitude
barometric
pressure
anyway
besides
that
minor
glitch
i
like
the
slip
on
performance
and
the
sound
which
is
louder
than
stock
but
not
loud
enough
to
annoy
folks
the
ontario
slip
on
use
some
sort
of
sound
baffling
technique
to
reduce
the
sound
at
full
throttle
just
remember
every
bike
is
a
tuned
system
when
you
change
the
intake
or
exhaust
characteristics
beyond
the
allowable
delta
of
the
manufacturer
you
may
have
to
change
other
areas
to
compensate
like
a
complete
change
of
the
exhaust
system
header
and
muffler
changes
the
exhaust
characteristic
to
the
point
which
rejetting
is
required
to
compensate
for
the
new
engine
breathingpumping
profile
talk
with
the
folks
who
make
the
slip
on
you
intend
to
use
and
ask
them
if
they
have
used
it
on
your
particular
bike
check
with
people
who
have
the
system
also
to
see
what
they
think
about
there
slip
on
also
as
a
last
data
point
in
sport
riders
first
issue
did
a
review
on
a
group
of
header
and
exhaust
systems
for
the
cbrf
they
also
included
as
a
side
bar
the
ontario
slip
on
the
dyno
showed
an
increase
from
stock
of
bhp
at
the
rear
wheel
verses
buyer
beware
of
outrageous
claimed
increases
in
horse
power
it
may
have
been
true
in
the
past
but
not
today
