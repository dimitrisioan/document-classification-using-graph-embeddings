on
a
waterski
bike
you
turn
the
handlebars
left
to
lean
right
just
like
on
a
motorcycle
so
this
supports
the
movethecontactpatchfrombeneaththe
centreofmass
theory
on
how
to
lean
this
contradicts
the
need
for
gyroscopic
precession
to
have
a
countersteering
induced
lean
for
a
waterski
bike
it
contradicts
nothing
for
a
motorcycle
not
only
that
but
this
morning
i
saw
a
tv
ad
for
a
waterski
bike
a
sea
doo
for
those
who
care
i
watched
the
lengthy
ad
very
carefully
and
in
every
case
and
at
every
speed
the
riders
turned
the
handlebars
left
to
go
left
and
right
to
go
right
in
other
words
they
were
not
countersteering
so
perhaps
it
is
only
some
waterski
bikes
on
which
one

there
is

for
