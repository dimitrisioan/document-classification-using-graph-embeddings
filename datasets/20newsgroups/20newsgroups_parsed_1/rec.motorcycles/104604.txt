i
was
able
to
avoid
an
accident
by
revving
my
engine
and
having
my
stock
harley
pipes
make
enough
noise
to
draw
someones
attention
sure
there
are
horns
but
my
hand
is
already
on
the
throttle
should
we
get
into
how
many
feet
a
bike
going
mph
goes
in
seconds
or
how
long
it
would
take
me
to
push
my
horn
button
if
we
do
i
think
youd
loose
sure
youre
hands
already
on
the
throttle
and
your
thumb
is
already
near
the
horn
button
pushing
the
horn
button
is
one
simple
move
revving
the
throttle
requires
either
engaging
the
clutch
or
accelerating
the
first
is
a
more
complex
manuver
than
a
simple
horn
button
push
and
the
second
aint
too
bright
when
there
is
a
potential
hazard
ahead
besides
the
unique
sound
of
a
horn
is
more
effective
in
attracting
the
attention
of
bdi
cagers
than
is
the
sound
of
an
engine
which
is
what
they
expect
to
hear
you
are
on
the
road
as
is
usually
the
case
a
single
anecdote
hardly
constitutes
sound
safety
procedure
the
answer
is
feet
ed
green
former
ninjaite
i
was
drinking
last
night
with
a
biker
and
i
showed
him
a
picture
of
you
i
said
dod
go
on
get
to
know
her
youll
like
her
the
grateful
dead
it
seemed
like
the
least
i
could
do
