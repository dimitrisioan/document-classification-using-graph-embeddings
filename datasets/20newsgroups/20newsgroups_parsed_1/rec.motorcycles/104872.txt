heh
an
attitude
when
he
was
stopped
speaking
as
a
guy
who
recieved
a
verbal
warning
for
mph
in
a
i
just
have
to
laugh
in
shreveport
back
when
i
was
riding
the
purple
water
buffalo
i
jumped
an
intersection
in
front
of
a
cop
who
was
waiting
for
the
light
the
side
of
the
street
he
was
on
was
hidden
buy
a
building
on
the
corner
and
i
didnt
see
him
till
i
was
airborne
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
i
was
parked
had
my
helment
off
and
my
liscence
out
before
he
turned
the
corner
he
chewed
my
ass
out
and
let
me
go
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
it
was
a
very
squidly
thing
to
do
jumping
the
intersection
like
that
the
cop
should
have
nailed
me
i
find
that
if
you
are
polite
respectfull
and
honest
they
will
normaly
let
you
get
away
with
a
lot
of
stuff
ps
the
shock
mounts
folded
up
the
next
day
i
guess
i
deserved
that
dod
techniciandr
speed
not
student
stolen
taglines
hey
where
did
they
go
you
dont
think
naahh
