i
need
help
with
my
zxa
i
put
supertrapp
slipons
on
it
and
had
the
carbs
rejetted
to
match
a
set
of
kn
filters
that
replaced
the
stock
airbox
now
i
have
a
huge
flat
spot
in
the
carburation
at
about
thousand
rpm
in
most
any
gear
this
is
especially
frustrating
on
the
highway
the
bike
likes
to
cruise
at
about
mph
which
happens
to
be
rpm
in
sixth
gear
ive
had
it
tuned
and
this
doesnt
seem
to
help
i
am
thinking
about
new
carbs
or
the
injection
system
from
a
gpz
does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
for
a
fix
besides
restoring
it
to
stock
the
brain
dead
ted
nugent
it
sound
like
to
me
that
your
carbs
are
not
jetted
properly
if
you
did
it
yourself
take
it
to
a
shop
and
get
it
done
right
if
a
shop
did
it
get
your
money
back
and
go
to
another
shop
