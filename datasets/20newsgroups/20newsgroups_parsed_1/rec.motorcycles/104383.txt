im
a
biker
and
a
doglover
no
wonder
bikers
have
such
a
horrid
reputation
go
find
a
human
the
interesting
thing
about
dogs
is
that
body
language
communicates
a
great
deal
to
them
the
more
effective
you
are
at
communicating
body
language
the
less
you
actually
have
to
do
i
agree
completely
unfortunately
the
majority
of
my
feelings
before
i
can
even
start
to
think
rationally
abhout
the
dog
that
is
trying
to
kill
me
are
fear
when
theres
been
a
moment
to
set
up
like
you
said
a
bit
down
the
road
or
whatever
ive
never
had
a
problem
with
dogs
curt
howland
ace
dod
eff
v
sabre
meddle
not
in
the
afairs
of
wizards
for
it
makes
them
soggy
and
hard
to
relight
