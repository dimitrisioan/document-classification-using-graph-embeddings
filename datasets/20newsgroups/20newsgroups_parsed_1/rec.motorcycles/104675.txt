waving
at
other
bikers
makes
more
sense
than
just
hey
hows
it
going
nice
to
meet
you
on
the
road
have
a
good
ride
it
keeps
you
in
the
habit
of
watching
really
carefully
for
bikes
when
youre
in
a
cage
this
is
a
good
thing
has
anyone
while
driving
a
cage
ever
waved
at
bikers
i
get
the
urge
but
ive
never
actually
done
it
ive
had
people
in
cages
wave
at
me
or
give
me
the
thumbs
up
on
occassion
i
always
return
the
wave
or
thumbs
up
that
never
happened
to
me
until
i
started
riding
harleys
so
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
why
not
try
waving
what
bad
could
happen
