for
those
who
have
had
problems
with
small
birds
what
about
the
large
raptor
types
when
they
are
swooping
across
the
road
after
smallish
prey
i
had
a
hawk
falcon
what
ever
come
within
feet
of
me
lucky
for
him
or
me
for
that
matter
he
noticed
me
and
my
and
pulled
up
on
hisher
trajectory
at
the
last
moment
scared
the
shit
outa
menothing
like
a
red
tailed
hawk
in
the
face
talons
and
alli
wonder
if

i
got
a
male
mallard
duck
in
the
chest
once
it
was
like
being
kicked
by
my
karate
instructor
no
accident
but
my
eyes
were
tearing
so
hard
and
i
was
wheezing
so
loudly
that
its
quite
remarkable
that
i
was
able
to
come
to
a
stop
with
the
rubber
side
up
the
duck
btw
lived
and
seemed
quite
healthy
though
we
both
sat
by
the
roadside
and
shook
our
heads
for
a
few
minutes
the
bruise
went
from
my
right
collar
bone
all
the
way
down
to
my
belly
button

within
the
span
of
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
heard
elements
of
separate
threads
which
in
that
they
have
been
conjoined
in
time
struck
together
to
form
a
new
chord
within
my
hollow
and
echoing
gourd
