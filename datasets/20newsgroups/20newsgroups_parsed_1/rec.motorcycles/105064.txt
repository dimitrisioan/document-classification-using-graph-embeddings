on
a
completely
different
tack
what
was
the
eventual
outcome
of
babe
vs
the
badmouthed
biker
i
thought
i
posted
this
last
year
the
women
came
to
court
with
three
witnesses
the
two
women
that
were
in
the
car
and
one
neighbor
that
heard
me
shouting
my
lawyer
didnt
like
the
odds
since
there
were
multiple
complaints
both
ways
and
the
judge
had
a
history
of
finding
everyone
guilty
of
at
least
something
so
he
convinced
us
she
came
without
a
lawyer
to
drop
everything
the
net
result
was
a
laywer
bill
for
me
and
court
costs
for
her
the
only
consolation
was
that
she
had
trouble
scraping
together
the
while
is
not
quite
one
weeks
beer
money
for
me
