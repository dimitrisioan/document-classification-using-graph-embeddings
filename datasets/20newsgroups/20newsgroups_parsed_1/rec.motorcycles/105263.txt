whos
probably
reading
this
right
now
just
bought
a
new
yamaha
virago
after
spending
hours
very
late
one
chilly
evening
watching
him
struggle
with
the
bolts
had
to
remove
the
right
peg
loosen
the
brake
pedal
c
c
ive
pretty
much
decided
never
to
get
this
particular
model
unless
he
or
someone
else
wants
to
change
the
oilfilter
for
me
compared
to
the
minute
change
he
was
used
to
for
his
honda
this
is
just
a
design
flawoversight
in
my
eyes
patricia
sure
dont
know
what
bike
was
being
worked
on
but
it
sure
wasnt
a
virago
ive
owned
both
the
and
and
you
can
do
the
filter
change
in
about
mins
and
nothing
has
to
be
removed
obviously
the
new
bike
was
modified
as
the
stock
machine
is
simple
to
work
on
watching
for
imitators
