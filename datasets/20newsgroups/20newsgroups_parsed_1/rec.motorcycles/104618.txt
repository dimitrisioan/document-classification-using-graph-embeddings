ducati
s
are
really
slow
they
dont
sell
them
over
here
in
us
but
considering
that
the
ss
is
not
too
powerful
the
is
gon
na
be
a
dog
oh
yeah
at
mph
in
the
quarter
is
such
a
slug
come
on
when
was
the
last
time
you
used
your
s
max
power
peak
i
think
maybe
you
should
ride
one
first
before
passing
judgement
there
is
a
lot
more
than
just
maximum
acceleration
i
guess
im
out
of
touch
but
what
exactly
is
the
ducati
a
vtwin
desmo
or
is
it
that
halfavtwin
with
the
balance
weight
where
the
nd
cylinder
would
go
a
second
for
a
isnt
bad
at
all
sorry
i
should
have
been
more
specific
the
ss
ran
the
quater
in
the
last
small
vtwin
duc
we
got
in
the
us
and
the
is
a
pantah
based
vtwin
was
the
sl
pantah
and
it
ran
a
creditable
modern
carbs
and
what
not
should
put
the
in
the
high
s
at
btw
fzr
s
ran
mid
s
and
the
latest
crop
of
japanese
s
will
out
run
that
its
hard
to
remember
but
but
a
new
goof
will
clobber
an
old
