hello
folks
im
very
happy
with
my
new
rgs
my
range
is
miles
on
gallons
thats
mpg
surprisingly
the
bike
is
a
real
cruiser
i
was
expecting
something
rough
shes
a
sweet
backroad
honey
and
i
can
go
pretty
much
anyplace
id
take
my
mountain
bike
as
far
as
shaft
effect
its
more
a
torque
effect
from
the
crankshaft
in
my
opinion
rev
it
sitting
still
when
the
driveshaft
is
not
moving
and
the
bike
twists
a
bit
maybe
if
the
clutch
is
in
then
a
large
chunk
of
counterrotating
mass
is
not
rotating
hence
at
a
light
reving
makes
it
twist
shaft
effect
is
the
rear
end
rising
under
power
or
the
real
problem
getting
lower
to
the
road
when
the
throttle
is
snapped
shut
say
when
you
are
cornering
and
the
heads
are
real
close
to
the
road
new
gs
bikes
with
the
paralever
shaft
have
almost
no
shaft
effect
i
dont
ride
her
fast
enough
to
get
a
shaft
effect
but
in
my
opinion
a
little
buffeting
by
wind
is
of
far
greater
consequence
okay
here
are
my
questions
any
recommendations
for
a
homemade
fairing
id
like
to
keep
the
wind
off
my
chest
and
perhaps
my
helmet
for
comfort
at
highway
speeds
mph
yet
dont
want
to
a
screw
up
the
stability
or
b
block
my
vision
too
much
for
trail
riding
anybody
have
luck
with
twopiece
detachible
fairings
id
like
to
make
it
myself
out
of
plexiglas
i
run
two
lights
the
standard
headlamp
plus
a
sidelamp
mounted
on
the
crash
bar
the
illuminations
excellent
that
way
with
a
full
beam
coming
out
from
the
level
of
the
motor
left
side
the
lamp
beam
is
linear
so
that
you
get
a
bright
streak
of
illumination
from
left
to
right
and
it
really
picks
up
the
periphery
deer
lurking
etc
combined
with
the
headlamp
on
high
you
can
see
like
day
but
ive
heard
that
bmw
alternators
dont
crank
out
too
much
do
i
need
to
shut
down
the
sidelamp
when
im
puttering
around
in
the
dirt
at
low
rpm
its
a
question
of
how
long
you
spend
at
low
rpm
and
how
much
you
need
the
extra
light
at
low
rpm
k
and
under
they
dont
charge
all
that
much
if
at
all
the
alternators
put
out
sufficient
wattage
it
just
that
you
need
to
be
at
k
rpm
to
get
it
this
is
embarassing
im
having
trouble
starting
the
bike
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
invariably
flood
the
carbs
then
go
in
and
read
a
section
of
the
paper
and
then
she
starts
right
up
is
this
a
zen
thing
full
choke
open
the
gas
taps
hit
the
starter
and
ever
so
slightly
blip
the
throttle
it
should
fire
cranking
should
be
done
with
minimal
throttle
my
r
likes
the
throttles
to
be
raised
just
a
bit
off
idle
its
an
experience
thing
like
zen
its
hard
to
describe
it
can
be
hard
to
learn
if
you
arent
paying
atttention
to
the
differences
between
success
and
failure
especially
if
you
get
really
pissed
off
and
flatten
the
battery
while
trying
to
get
it
to
run
if
my
bike
has
been
sitting
for
a
few
weeks
i
give
it
a
short
while
to
start
if
it
doesnt
i
turn
it
off
and
wait
a
few
minutes
for
things
to
vaporize
in
the
fuel
system
and
then
it
lights
right
off
ive
got
dual
plugs
which
make
it
easier
to
start
the
haynes
manual
says
do
not
under
any
circumstances
use
gasoline
with
alcohol
additives
yeah
right
what
do
you
folks
due
to
keep
the
engine
and
carbs
from
being
eaten
by
ethanol
and
methanol
any
particular
brands
of
gas
that
are
best
additives
the
big
fix
is
the
bing
carb
upgrade
kit
its
good
for
a
few
mpg
and
the
parts
are
alcohol
proof
the
parts
it
replaces
arent
alcohol
proof
as
long
as
the
bike
isnt
going
to
sit
for
long
periods
of
time
gasohol
is
nice
since
it
helps
keep
ping
away
if
your
bike
doesnt
ping
on
cheap
gas
you
ought
to
raise
the
compression
half
a
smiley
the
bmw
twins
of
the
s
and
beyond
have
lowered
compression
to
keep
the
epa
happy
dual
plugs
and
higher
compression
give
back
a
big
chunk
of
the
lost
perfomance
