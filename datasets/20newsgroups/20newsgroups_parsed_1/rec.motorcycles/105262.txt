also
remember
that
its
much
more
draining
and
tiring
to
ride
up
than
by
yourself
because
youre
concentrating
on
much
more
and
in
the
zen
of
the
moment
less
remember
this
the
first
few
times
i
pillioned
someone
whose
safety
was
a
great
concern
to
me
as
opposed
to
brothers
etc
i
almost
got
us
both
killed
on
several
occasions
i
was
surprised
to
discover
that
it
is
much
safer
to
just
drive
than
to
distract
yourself
by
trying
to
be
unusually
cautious
and
concerned
abruptly
adopting
a
novel
set
of
thought
patterns
and
riding
strategies
while
piloting
a
bike
is
just
asking
for
trouble
