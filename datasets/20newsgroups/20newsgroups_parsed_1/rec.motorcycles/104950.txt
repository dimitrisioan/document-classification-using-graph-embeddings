says
the
ft

fun
i
wanted
to
buy
one
but
i
waited
years
an
bought
a
hawk
instead
friends
owners
of
the
former
cycle
shop
on
in
andover
bought
one
new
but
several
years
old
cost
him
you
should
not
pay
too
much
for
one
i
hear
they
can
be
fitted
with
the
front
end
of
a
cc
interceptor
and
thus
have
great
brakes
sounds
like
fun
some
dude
on
this
forum
has
one
thats
all
tricked
out
second
hand
bike
warns
that
they
are
fine
up
until
miles
the
ft
is
a
good
beginners
bike
with
a
reasonable
seating
position
enough
power
to
get
you
up
and
around
but
not
so
much
itll
scare
the
bejeebers
out
of
you
tips
over
well
and
easy
to
pick
up
dont
ask
simple
maintenance
ive
had
mine
for
four
or
so
years
and
havent
had
any
serious
problems
with
it
i
bought
it
used
for
with
about
miles
on
it
just
last
week
someone
in
the
neighborhood
stopped
by
to
ask
me
about
it
whether
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beginners
bike
is
it
comfortable
and
powerful
enough
blah
blah
blah
seems
he
found
one
used
for
with
about
miles
on
it
the
reall
trick
mod
ive
heard
was
to
take
the
front
end
from
a
hurricane
and
slide
it
in
this
was
from
a
guy
who
campaigns
two
ascots
in
sos
racing
he
says
they
do
pretty
well
too
once
you
strip
off
the
starter
lights
and
other
assorted
street
paraphernalia
its
a
pretty
fast
and
light
bike
