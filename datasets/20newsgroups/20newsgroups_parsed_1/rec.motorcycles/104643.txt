gse
its
a
great
bike
but
youd
better
be
damn
careful
i
got
a
as
my
third
motorcycle
deleta
the
bike
is
light
for
its
size
i
think
its
pounds
but
heavy
for
a
beginner
bike
heavy
for
a
beginner
bike
it
is
pounds
it
isnt
except
maybe
in
some
admans
dream
with
a
full
tank
its
in
the
area
of
lbs
depending
on
year
etc
youre
you
should
have
no
problem
physically
managing
it
the
seat
is
roughly
akin
to
a
plasticcoated
by
very
firm
to
very
painful
depending
upon
time
in
the
saddle
the
and
versions
had
a
much
better
seat
imo
the
bike
suffers
from
the
infamous
suzuki
regulator
problem
i
have
so
far
avoided
forking
out
the
roughly
for
the
suzuki
part
by
kludging
in
different
honda
regulatorrectifier
units
from
junkyards
the
charging
system
consistently
overcharges
the
battery
i
have
to
refill
it
nearly
weekly
this
in
itself
is
not
so
bad
but
battery
access
is
gained
only
after
removing
the
seat
the
tank
and
the
airbox
my
regulator
lasted
over
miles
and
didnt
overcharge
the
battery
the
wiring
connectors
in
the
charging
path
did
get
toasty
though
tending
to
melt
their
insulation
i
suspect
they
were
underspecified
it
didnt
help
that
they
were
well
removed
from
cool
air
battery
access
on
the
earlier
bikes
doesnt
require
tank
removal
after
you
learn
the
drill
its
pretty
straightforward
replacement
parts
like
all
suzuki
parts
are
outrageously
expensive
having
bought
replacement
parts
for
several
brands
of
motorcycles
ill
offer
a
grain
of
salt
to
be
taken
with
dales
assessment
good
luck
and
be
careful
dale
sentiments
i
cant
argue
withor
wont
