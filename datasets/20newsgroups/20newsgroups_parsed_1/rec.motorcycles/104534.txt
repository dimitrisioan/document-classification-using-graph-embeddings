ive
got
a
friend
shopping
for
her
first
motorcycle
this
is
great
unfortunately
she
needs
at
most
a
seat
this
is
not
great
so
far
the
only
thing
weve
found
was
an
old
and
unhappylooking
kz
i
had
a
kz
and
thought
it
was
the
best
bike
ive
ever
ridden
and
mind
you
ive
ridden
many
bikes
i
seem
to
remember
a
thread
with
a
point
similar
to
this
passing
through
several
months
ago
did
anybody
keep
that
list
you
must
be
mistaken
no
thread
in
this
group
has
ever
had
a
point
seriously
there
are
many
short
bikes
out
there
what
style
bike
and
how
much
money
does
she
have
my
so
is
and
rides
her
cb
or
my
hawk

ease
most
cruisers

low
slung
ysrs
