what
worked
for
me
on
my
rd
was
to
lean
towards
the
dog
as
i
modulated
throttle
to
keep
my
ankle
just
ahead
of
his
teeth
after
a
few
seconds
of
warm
pipe
firmly
wedged
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
his
face
sideways
to
see
what
was
so
warm
and
got
his
mouthnosemuzzle
burned
on
the
pipes
a
bicycling
technique
ive
employed
was
to
use
my
frame
mounted
tire
pump
to
fend
off
dog
attacks
one
of
my
brothers
had
spent
a
lot
of
time
practicing
bizzare
tricks
on
his
megabuckmicromass
bike
he
said
he
once
repelled
a
dog
attack
by
picking
up
the
rear
of
the
bike
and
smacking
the
dog
in
the
side
of
the
head
with
the
rear
wheel
the
dog
had
no
idea
what
hit
him
and
he
fled
quite
rapidly
then
again
he
could
jump
garbage
cans
without
a
ramp
so
i
dont
think
id
care
to
try
this
one
on
a
motorcycle
the
telephone
worked
much
better
than
the
tire
pump
thats
almost
unfair
ive
never
seen
a
dog
that
could
use
a
phone
