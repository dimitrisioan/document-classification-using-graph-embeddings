ok
so
weve
got
a
hotly
contested
bmwoa
election
and
some
inept
leadership
my
question
is
the
history
of
the
bmw

that
lead
to
the
formation
of
the
bmwra
was
there
something
going
on
in
the
oa
years
ago
that
precipitated
the
formation
of
two
competing
owners
groups
yep
both
were
started
nominally
simultaneously
splitsville
from
the
start
ie
if
my
sources
are
correct
one
guy
was
involved
in
the
start
of
both
groups
