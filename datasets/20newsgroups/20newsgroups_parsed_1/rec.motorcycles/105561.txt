fine
but
at

and
time
please
lets
not
trample
over
others
rights
and
then
bitch
because
they
dont
treat
us
like
gods
michael
menard
you
know
i
wasnt
even
going
to
respond
to
this
typical
antiparty
attitude
message
trash
was
everywhere
reason
not
enough
dipsy
dumpsters
for
the
massive
crowd
oatman
wasnt
prepared
for
the
vast
number
of
people
that
showed
up
i
dont
think
michaels
response
was
antiparty
but
rather
proenvironmental
i
agree
that
you
got
ta
let
us
hogs
out
to
roam
every
once
in
awhile
lets
hope
that
next
year
oatman
will
be
better
prepared
and
that
we
all
pick
up
after
ourselves
an
asshole
ive
already
admitted
im
an
asshole
many
times
on
the
net
all
my
friends
are
assholes
too
lyrics
to
a
new
song
so
you
want
a
dime
to
call
someone
that
cares
well
i
for
one
thought
you
told
a
good
story
even
if
you
say
you
are
an
ahole
we
need
more
biker
experiances
written
to
news
its
unfortunate
that
you
got
flamed
for
telling
it
but
we
all
know
this
is
a
controversial
group
at
any
rate
keep
up
the
good
work
and
continue
to
post
stories
