re
battery
storage
why
not
charge
and
store
dry
in
article
mark
fox
says
quite
right
your
batteries
should
be
perfectly
alright
and
retain
most
of
their
charge
if
drained
and
dried
well
but
id
throw
out
the
electrolyte
and
buy
some
more
when
you
need
it
and
before
anyone
says
im
wrong
remember
that
new
batteries
almost
always
come
ready
charged
and
dry
and
they
are
perfectly
ok
even
after
several
years
storage
at
the
shop
mark
fox
makes
sense
to
me
after
all
when
steel
is
manufactured
and
stored
they
put
oil
on
it
so
it
wont
rust
logicaly
when
you
store
your
bike
you
must
strip
the
paint
and
put
oil
on
the
metal
to
prevent
rus
