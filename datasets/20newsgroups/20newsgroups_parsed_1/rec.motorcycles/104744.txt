whenhow
do
you
decide
that
it
is
too
windy
to
ride
when
its
too
windy
to
stand
when
youre
on
the
road
in
high
winds
stay
alert
even
more
alert
than
your
alert
cause
youre
on
a
motorcycle
and
theyre
out
to
kill
you
kind
of
alert
be
aware
of
the
terrain
and
how
it
may
funnel
wind
in
sudden
gusts
well
not
gusts
to
somebody
standing
there
but
its
gusty
cause
you
ride
through
it
if
you
are
riding
in
a
steady
crosswind
be
aware
of
a
hill
that
will
block
the
wind
and
adjust
your
lean
angle
be
aware
of
passing
trucks
to
your
windward
side
your
lean
angle
will
change
dramatically
both
as
you
enter
and
as
you
leave
their
turbulance
cone
reducing
your
profile
may
help
ie
lean
on
the
gas
tank
and
kiss
the
triple
clamp
keep
a
nimble
hand
on
the
steering
be
ready
to
countersteer
into
and
out
of
sudden
wind
bursts
keep
a
larger
than
usual
buffer
zone
both
ahead
and
behind
and
to
the
side
you
can
easily
be
blown
half
a
lane
over
before
you
can
react
by
countersteering
keep
a
close
eye
on
traffic
in
your
mirror
if
someone
is
coming
up
wanting
to
pass
get
out
of
their
way
early
stop
often
for
short
brakes
extensive
riding
in
high
winds
is
both
mentally
and
physically
fatiguing

former
ninjaite
i
was
drinking
last
night
with
a
biker
and
i
showed
him
a
picture
of
you

said
dod
go
on
get
to
know
her
youll
like
her
the
grateful
dead
it
seemed
like
the
least
i
could
do
