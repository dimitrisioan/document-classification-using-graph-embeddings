i
believe
it
was
jeff
deeney
posted
what
ive
since
come
to
recognize
as
the
ultimate
april
fools
posting
ever
it
wasnt
particularly
nice
of
him
as
several
people
were
quite
fooled
and
very
worried
about
him
but
i
cant
fault
the
effectiveness
based
on
numerous
inputs
most
of
them
unprintable
i
deemed
it
time
for
a
kinder
gentler
april
not
that
i
didnt
have
something
really
sick
and
twisted
ready
to
post
perhaps
next
year
personally
i
think
jeffypoo
was
still
smarting
more
from
the
third
degree
burns
he
suffered
after
april
st
last
year
rather
than
the
supposed
burns
that
he
suffered
in
the
joke
granted
i
was
one
of
those
people
that
were
taken
in
by
it
and
i
was
certainly
concernedand
then
pissed
at
him
for
pulling
such
a
thing
which
i
made
known
to
him
but
then
again
for
an
april
fool
joke
i
would
also
go
on
record
as
saying
that
it
was
the
best
orchestrated
one
ive
ever
seen
and
it
certainly
sucked
a
lot
of
people
into
believing
it
sick
twisted
who
in
this
group
could
ever
be
accused
of
such
a
thing
i
tip
my
twisted
lid
to
