what
worked
for
me
on
my
rd
was
to
lean
towards
the
dog
as
i
modulated
throttle
to
keep
my
ankle
just
ahead
of
his
teeth
after
a
few
seconds
of
warm
pipe
firmly
wedged
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
his
face
sideways
to
see
what
was
so
warm
and
got
his
mouthnosemuzzle
burned
on
the
pipes
one
yip
and
he
veered
away
never
to
chase
me
again
