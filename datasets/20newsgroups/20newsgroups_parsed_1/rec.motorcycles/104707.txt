lastest
rumor
is
hp
at
the
rear
wheel
handles
like
a
dream
in
a
straight
line
to
and
then
gets
a

upset
according
to
a
review
in
cycle
world
cornering
er
well
you
cant
have
everything
sure
you
can
have
everything
if
by
everything
you
mean
fast
straight
line
performance
and
handling
present

liter
sport
bikes
have
more
horsepower
and
have
faster
and
mile
times
than
the
vmax
plus
they
corner
just
a
bit
better
seriously
handling
is
probably
as
good
as
the
big
standards
of
the
early
s
but
not
compareable
to
whats
state
of
the
