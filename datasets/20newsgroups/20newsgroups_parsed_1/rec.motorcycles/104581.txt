dropped

off
the
seat
of
my
bike
while
trying
to
cb
rock
cb
it
onto
its
centerstand
chipped
the
heck
out
of
the
paint
on
it
cb
do
i
have
to
be
the
one
to
say
it
cb
dont
be
so
stupid
as
to
leave
your
helmet
on
the
seat
where
it
can
cb
fall
down
and
go
boom
cb
helmets
go
on
the
ground
on
a
table
on
a
chair
on
a
shelf
or
on
cb
any
other
surface
that
is
large
enough
to
support
them
so
that
they
cb
will
not
easily
be
knocked
down
another
good
place
for
your
helmet
is
your
mirror
i
kid
you
not
if
you
own
a
typical
standard
or
other
bike
with
fairly
average
mirrors
that
screw
into
your
handlebars
your
helmet
should
fit
over
your
mirror
and
be
fairly
stable
i
doubt
i
have
to
mention
it
but
this
trick
isnt
quite
so
smart
on
a
goldwing
cbr
any
gsxr
or
any
bike
with
fairingmounted
mirrors
i
was
a
little
surprised
though
to
find
that
you
had
your
helmet
on
your
seat
while
you
were
centerstanding
your
bike
i
usually
leave
my
helmet
on
until
my
bike
is
parked
if
for
no
other
reason
than
i
wouldnt
want
my
helmet
to
be
on
any
surface
that
i
was
about
to
start
tilting
