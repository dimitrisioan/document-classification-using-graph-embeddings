ny
times
turned
out
to
be
a
screw
unscrewed
inside
my
mikuni
hs
carb
i
keep
hearing
that
one
should
keep
all
of
the
screws
tight
on
a
bike
but
i
never
thought
that
i
had
to
do
that
on
the
screws
inside
of
a
carb
at
least
it
was
roadside
fixable
and
i
was
on
my
way
in
hardly
any
time
you
better
check
all
the
screws
in
that
carb
before
you
suck
one
into
a
jug
and
munge
a
piston
or
valve
ive
seen
it
happen
before
