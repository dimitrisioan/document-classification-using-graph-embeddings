keeper
of

writes
i
plan
to
switch
to
a
single
fire
ignition
in
about
a
month
and
was
curious
if
anyone
has
experience
with
the
supposedly
new
crane
single
fire
that
competes
with
the
dynas
the
club
wrench
not
the
wench
has
done
dynas
modules
for
several
friends
and
ill
get
one
also
unless
a
bunch
of
folks
say
the
crane
is
better
one
guy
just
installed
the
mc
power
arc
ignition
but
has
not
yet
reported
the
results
it
was
not
a
simple
boltin
replacement
as
new
mounting
holes
had
to
be
drilled
i
recognize
its
more
fun
to
discuss
why
chris
needed
to
change
brands
of
penis
enhancer
but
how
bout
some
comments
on
single
fire
ignitions
for
a
while
i
just
installed
a
mc
power
arc
ii
and
it
seems
to
run
great
i
also
used
mc
coils
and
neither
the
ignition
module
or
the
coils
required
any
new
mounting
holes
to
be
drilled
on
my
fxstc
a
little
soldering
and
all
was
fine
static
timing
was
real
easy
to
set
too
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
my
local
wrench
whose
opinion
i
invariably
seek
but
dont
always
adopt
thinks
mc
power
arc
is
a
piece
of
shit
and
says
all
them
jap
chips
are
gon
na
fail
you
one
day
needless
to
say
he
doesnt
like
any
electronic
ignition
modules
and
recommends
the
dynas
system
i
think
thats
the
one
with
the
halleffect
timing
sensors
correct
