as
a
new
bmw
owner
i
was
thinking
about
signing
up
for
the
moa
but
right
now
it
is
beginning
to
look
suspiciously
like
throwing
money
down
a
rathole
i
concur
with
this
the
politics
and
bickering
going
on
has
ruined
bmwmoa
to
me
because
of
the
politics
and
fighting
im
im
going
to
let
my
current
membership
lapse
when
its
up
for
renewal

bmwras
on
the
level
is
a
far
superiour
publication
in
my
opinion
