hi
janice
i
dont
know
if
im
being
unduly
cautious
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
used
helmet
not
for
normal
road
use
anyway
you
never
really
know
whats
happened
to
them
in
their
past
life
have
fun
lisa
rowlands
ill
second
that
i
saw
a
list
somewhere
of
all
the
stuff
that
it
was
unwise
to
buy
secondhand
stuff
like
parachutes
toilet
paper
condoms
and
motorcycle
helmets
seriously
though
why
take
the
risk
you
are
extremely
unlikely
to
get
a
goodfitting
secondhand
helmet
cos
life
just
doesnt
work
like
that
and
as
lisa
says
you
never
know
where
its
been
before
