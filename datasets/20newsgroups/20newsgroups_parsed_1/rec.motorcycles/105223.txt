ive
got
a
friend
shopping
for
her
first
motorcycle
this
is
great
unfortunately
she
needs
at
most
a
seat
this
is
not
great
so
far
the
only
thing
weve
found
was
an
old
and
unhappylooking
kz
i
have
been
checking
out
bikes
hoping
for
lowish
seats
for
a
few
weeks
a
honda
twinstar
cc
fit
me
well
a
honda
hawk
cc
did
not
the
kawasaki
hbsbsh
cant
remember
looked
like
it
would
fit
me
well
but
the
price
tag
was
way
too
large
i
seem
to
remember
a
thread
with
a
point
similar
to
this

through
several
months
ago

list
