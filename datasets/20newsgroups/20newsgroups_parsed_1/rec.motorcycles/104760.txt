i
understand
why
you
theoretically
stop
so
far
behind
a
car
but
can
you
really
in
actuality
avoid
such
an
incident
suggestions
an
even
better
strategy
is
to
leave
less
of
a
buffer
between
you
and
the
car
in
front
but
enough
to
manuver
around
it
keep
the
bike
in
st
gear
with
the
clutch
handle
squeezed
in
hows
that
for
engageddisengaged
until
there
are
two
cars
stopped
behind
you
when
the
next
bdi
cager
comes
screaching
in
simply
ride
up
along
side
of
the
car
in
front
of
you
you
dont
need
to
panic
and
do
it
or
you
will
pop
the
clutch
and
stall
the
engine
do
is
smoothly
just
rapidly
the
cage
in
front
of
you
will
provide
much
better
protection
than
anything
else
