so
the
question
i
have
is
how
dangerous
is
riding
its
exactly
as
dangerous
as
it
looks
youre
hard
to
see
and
have
little
protection
keeping
out
of
trouble
means
knowing
your
limits
keeping
your
machine
in
good
shape
and
being
able
to
predict
and
make
up
for
every
stupid
move
that
drivers
make
out
there
we
deal
with
it
because
its
fun
but
staying
alive
takes
a
conscious
effort
ive
bike
like
jody
levine
dod
kv
got
a
you
can
if
you
pf
ride
it
toronto
ontario
canada
thanks
jody
i
cant
say
ive
ever
seen
it
summed
up
so
succinctly
before
i
might
only
add
two
things
stupid
road
design
or
poor
at
least
and
we
deal
with
it
for
the
fun
and
brotherhood
we
share
with
others
who
take
their
lives
in
their
hads
to
feel
the
wind
in
their
hairimho
binger
binger
is
is
there
really
such
a
thing
as
a
welcome
to
the
attitude
express
corporate
opinion
if
so
maybe
now
get
out
my
boss
will
let
me
express
it
