carrying
crutches
was
re
living
in
a
previous
article
don
fearn
says
when
i
broke
my
right
leg
in
two
places
not
a
motorcycle
accident
a
car
accident
who
woulda
thunk
it
i
put
my
crutches
on
gretchens
rear
rack
im
getting
the
metal
rod
pulled
out
on
friday
and
going
back
on
the
crutches
for
six
weeks
i
think
crutches
on
the
handlebars
sound
more
aesthetically
pleasing
how
did
you
attach
them
when
i
got
my
knee
rebuilt
i
got
back
on
the
street
bike
asap
i
put
the
crutches
on
the
rack
and
the
passenger
seat
and
they
hung
out
back
a
long
way
just
make
sure
theyre
tied
down
tight
in
front
and
no
problemo
go
fast
take
chances
