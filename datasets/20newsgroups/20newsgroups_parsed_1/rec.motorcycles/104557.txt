i
know
of
no
law
either
on
the
books
or
proposed
that
bans
motorcycles
from
any
place
that
i
want
to
go
to
many
private
places
ban
bikes
for
example
the
famous
mile
drive
at
the
monterrey
peninsula
and
i
have
stayed
at
resorts
that
sported
a
no
motorcycles
allowed
sign
at
the
entrance
and
there
have
been
public
places
call
the
ama
and
ask
for
jim
bensberg
sp
or
any
one
else
in
their
legislative
office
they
will
recound
the
many
public
places
that
they
had
to
bring
to
court
to
reverse
their
ban
on
bikes
that
includes
everything
from
public
parks
to
full
cities
there
are
probably
a
few
fights
on
their
books
as
we
now
speak
that
is
another
good
reason
to
donate
to
their
legislative
fund
death
is
lifes
way
of
telling
you
youve
been
fired
