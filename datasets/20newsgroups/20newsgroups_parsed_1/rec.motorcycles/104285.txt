watch
out
often
when
some
scumbag
steals
the
cover
that
means
that
they
were
or
are
looking
to
steal
the
bike
in
my
case
i
had
a
faded
cover
stolen
off
a
bmw
rrs
that
was
stashed
in
an
apartment
carport
and
not
visible
from
the
street
they
evidently
decided
the
beemer
wasnt
worth
stealing
but
did
try
the
next
night
to
steal
a
honda
hurricane
parked
in
the
next
apartment
building
a
neighbor
heard
them
wheeling
it
out
and
called
the
cops
i
know
this
is
just
setting
myself
up
but
this
is
actually
one
of
the
things
that
is
really
good
about
bmw
bikes
from
all
accounts
ive
heard
practically
no
one
steals
bmws
probably
it
is
similar
for
moto
guzzis
and
other
relative
exotics
since
there
isnt
a
large
demand
for
parts
and
the
bike
would
be
much
easier
to
track
down
it
seems
that
the
most
stolen
bikes
are
harleys
and
cc
jap
sport
bikes
