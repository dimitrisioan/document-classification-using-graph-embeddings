someone
recommend
how
to
ship
a
motorcycle
from
san

and
how
much
might
it
cost
id
recommend
that
you
hop
on
the
back
of
it
and
cruise
thats
a
really
nice
ride
if
you
choose
your
route
with
any
care
at
all
shouldnt
cost
more
than
about
in
gas
and
maybe
a
nights
motel
bill
yes
up
the
coast
over
to
portland
then
up
i
really
nice
most
of
the
way
and
im
sure
theres
even
better
ways

the
weather
though

drenching
as
possible
in
the
oregon
coast
