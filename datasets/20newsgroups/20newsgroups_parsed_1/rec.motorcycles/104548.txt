hello
everyone
im
new
to
motorcycles
so
no
flames
please
i
dont
have
my
bike
yet
so
i
need
a
few
pieces
of
information
any
stories
on
how
you
all
learned
ill
tell
you
my
story
as
an
example
of
what
not
to
do
early
in
i
took
some
riding
lessons
from
my
college
roommate
on
his
old
honda
cbt
he
had
taken
the
msf
beginners
course
so
i
actually
learned
some
of
what
i
needed
to
know
to
ride
i
proceeded
to
buy
a
beatup
honda
cl
for
and
a
helmet
and
rode
around
wearing
this
and
a
cotton
windbreaker
then
i
decided
to
invest
in
a
fullface
helmet
first
smart
move
sometime
around
then
i
also
passed
my
road
test
on
may
i
got
caught
in
a
rainstorm
on
my
way
home
from
a
mile
trip
entering
the
town
where
i
lived
a
rather
urban
suburb
i
had
to
stop
suddenly
for
a
red
light
that
i
noticed
too
late
skidded
the
rear
tire
out
and
was
ejected
face
upward
into
the
oncoming
lane
of
traffic
fortunately
for
me
the
oncoming
traffic
was
also
stopped
for
the
same
red
light
otherwise
i
might
have
slid
under
a
car
and
been
killed
now
this
is
anecdotal
evidence
to
be
sure
but
i
later
took
the
experienced
rider
course
from
the
msf
and
saw
that
earlier
training
could
have
helped
me
greatly
in
your
case
the
need
is
even
greater
since
you
have
nobody
to
help
you
practice
even
the
most
basic
stuff
as
i
did
so
my
advice
is
to
take
the
msf
beginners
course
first
thing
i
wouldnt
even
buy
a
bike
until
youve
taken
the
course
unless
you
happen
to
pick
up
a
real
good
deal
and
can
store
it
someplace
until
youre
ready
to
use
it
i
only
have
about
to
work
with
so
that
would
have
to
cover
everything
bike
helmet
anything
else
that
im
too
ignorant
to
know
i
need
to
buy
while
youre
waiting
to
take
the
course
it
might
take
a
few
weeks
in
dc
as
i
recall
there
were
always
waiting
lists
in
boston
could
you
save
up
some
more
money
to
start
out
right
say
for
riding
gear
plus
the
cost
bike
plus
maybe
guess
to
a
mechanic
to
make
sure
the
machine
is
safe
assuming
you
economize
by
buying
some
old
beatup
machine
from
a
private
individual
plus
insurance
plus
registration
and
licensing
fees
plus
the
course
youre
looking
at
maybe
not
including
the
bike
itself
and
a
reserve
for
ongoing
maintenance
what
is
buying
a
bike
going
to
do
to
my
insurance
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parents
have
been
taking
care
of
my
insurance
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehensive
list
of
costs
that
buying
a
motorcycle
is
going
to
insure
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
makes
a
difference
i
pay
about
insurance
now
upstate
ny
but
it
was
closer
to
in
boston
more
urban
for
decent
insurance
including
substantial
coverage
for
liability
which
you
want
unless
you
plan
always
to
be
poor
id
guess
dc
is
more
like
boston
than
like
a
rural
area
ergo
more
expensive
any
recommendations
on
what
i
should
buywhere
i
should
look
for
it
there
used
to
be
annual
buyers
guides
in
the
usual
motorcycle
magazines
i
found
those
helpful
in
getting
an
idea
of
what
new
or
recent
models
might
be
available
you
could
probably
look
through
past
issues
to
size
up
what
used
bikes
might
be
available
my
first
bike
was
years
old
when
i
bought
it
so
i
went
on
my
friends
advice
instead
also
look
at
the
bikes
that
you
see
people
riding
or
that
are
parked
on
the
street
i
basically
settled
on
my
present
bike
by
noticing
that
there
were
a
lot
of
highmileage
bmws
running
around
and
they
were
generally
set
up
the
way
i
wanted
nothing
wrong
with
talking
to
various
dealers
in
your
area
or
visiting
showrooms
dealers
in
the
boston
area
at
least
when
i
was
shopping
were
very
nice
about
letting
you
look
around
their
showrooms
and
quoting
prices
for
bikes
that
werent
the
latest
models
hence
cheaper
although
i
ended
up
buying
both
bikes
in
private
sales
