subject
re
drinking
and
riding
personally
i
follow
the
no
alcohol
rule
when
im
on
a
bike
my
view
is
that
you
have
to
be
in
such
a
high
degree
of
control
that
any
alcohol
could
be
potentially
hazardous
to
my
bike
if
i
get
hurt
its
my
own
fault
but
i
dont
want
to
wreck
my
katana
i
developed
this
philosophy
from
an
impromptu
experiment
i
had
one
beer
at
in
the
evening
and
had
volleyball
practice
at
i
wasnt
even
close
to
leagle
intoxication
but
i
couldnt
perform
even
the
most
basic
things
until
this
made
me
think
about
how
i
viewed
alcohol
and
intoxication
you
may
seem
fine
but
your
reactions
may
be
affected
such
that
youll
be
unable
to
recover
from
hitting
a
rock
or
even
just
a
gust
of
wind
i
greatly
enjoy
social
drinking
but
for
me
it
just
doesnt
mix
with
riding
max
enjoyment
