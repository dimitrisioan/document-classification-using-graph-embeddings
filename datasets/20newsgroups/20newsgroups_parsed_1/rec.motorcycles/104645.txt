for
riding
with
someone
on
pillion
in

this
person
is
lbs
and
fairly
small
so
i
dont
see
weight
as
too
much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
i
want
her
to
hold
onto
me
rather
than
the
grab
rail
out
back
and
ive
heard
that
she
should
look
over
my
shoulder
in
the
direction
were
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
ive
never
liked
my
passengers
to
try
and
shift
their
weight
with
the
turns
at
all
i
find
the
weight
shift
can
be
very
sudden
and
unnerving
its
one
thing
if
theyre
just
getting
comfortable
or
decide
to
look
over
your
other
shoulder
but
i
dont
recommend
having
himher
shift
her
weight
with
each
turn
too
violent
also
i
think
someone
already
said
this
make
sure
your
passenger
wears
good
gear
i
sometimes
choose
to
ride
without
a
helmet
or
lacking
other
safety
gear
depends
on
how
squidly
i
feel
but
i
wont
let
passengers
do
it
what
i
do
to
myself
i
can
handle
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
hurt
anyone
else
so
i
dont
let
them
on
without
gloves
jacket
at
least
jeans
heavy
boots
and
a
helmet
that
fits
i
really
want
this
to
be
a
positive
experience
for
us
both
mainly
so
that
shell
want
to
go
with
me
again
so
any
help
will
be
appreciated
go
real
easy
its
amazing
how
solid
a
grip
you
have
on
the
handle
bars
that
your
passenger
does
not
dont
make
her
feel
like
shes
going
to
slide
off
the
back
and
snappy
turns
for
you
are
sickening
lurches
for
her
in
general
it
feels
much
less
controlled
and
smooth
as
a
passenger
i
cant
stand
being
on
the
back
of
my
brothers
bike
and
i
ride
aggressively
when
i
ride
and
i
know
hes
a
good
pilot
still
everything
feels
very
unsteady
when
youre
a
passenger
