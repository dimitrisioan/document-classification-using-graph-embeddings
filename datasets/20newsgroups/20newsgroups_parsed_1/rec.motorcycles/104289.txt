hot
pursuit
yo
did
anybody
see
this
run
of
hard
copy
i
guy
on
a
katana
got
pulled
over
by
the
police
i
guess
for
speeding
or
something
but
just
as
the
cop
was
about
to
step
out
of
the
car
the
dude
punches
it
down
an
interstate
in
georgia
ang
then
the
cop
gives
chase
now
this
was
an
interesting
episode
because
it
was
all
videotaped
everything
from
the
dramatic
takeoff
and
mph
chase
to
the
sidestreet
battle
at
about
mph
what
happened
at
the
end
the
guy
who
is
being
relentless
chased
down
box
the
cage
with
the
disco
lights
slows
a
couple
of
times
to
taunt
the
cop
after
blowing
a
few
stop
signs
and
making
car
jump
to
the
side
he
goes
up
a
dead
end
street
the
kat
although
not
the
latest
machine
is
still
a
high
performance
machine
and
he
slams
on
the
brakes
of
couse
we
all
know
that
cages
especially
the
ones
with
the
disco
lights
cant
stop
as
fast
as
our
high
performance
machines
so
what
happens
the
cage
plows
into
the
kat
luckily
for
this
dude
he
was
wearing
a
helmet
and
was
not
hurt
but
dude
how
crazy
can
you
get
yeah
weve
all
went
out
and
played
cat
and
mouse
with
our
friends
but
with
a
cop
how
crazy
can
you
get
it
took
just
one
look
at
a
zx
who
tried
this
crap
to
convince
me
not
to
try
any
shit
like
that
although
the
dude
collided
with
a
car
head
on
at
mph
the
kawasaki
team
colors
still
looked
good
just
a
few
scratches
like
no
front
end
inch
long
engine
and
other
minor
scratches
if
you
guys
are
out
there
please
slow
it
down
i
not
being
an
advocate
for
the
cages
especially
the
ones
that
make
that
annoying
ass
noises
but
just
think
the
next
time
you
punched
it
whether
you
have
an
all
mighty
zx
or
a
i
can
do
it
ninja
just
remember
a
kid
could
step
out
at
any
time
peace
ride
kinda
safe

suzuki

travel

the
big
deal
about
riding

of
