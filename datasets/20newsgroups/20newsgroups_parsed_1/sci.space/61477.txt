if
you
want
people
to
back
the
space
program
it
must
be
a
good
thing
in
and
of
itself
i
think
we
should
tell
them
about
the
things
that
they
are
using
now
that
are
spinoffs
of
the
space
program
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
prove
its
worth
to
them
and
they
vote
and
pay
taxes
too
the
continued
existence
of
the
space
program
relies
upon
that
money
i
have
to
agree
with
ward
the
problem
with
your
approach
is
they
add
up
what
you
can
reasonably
claim
as
spinoffs
add
up
whats
been
spent
on
space
and
then
come
back
with
something
like
you
spent
x
billion
for
that
wouldnt
it
be
better
just
to
spend
the
money
on
direct
research
and
forget
all
this
space
stuff
we
could
have
got
all
that
stuff
a
lot
cheaper
that
way
space
is
wasteful
and
inefficient
then
they
cancel
your
funding
and
spend
it
studying
mating
rituals
of
new
guinea
tribesmen
or
something
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
