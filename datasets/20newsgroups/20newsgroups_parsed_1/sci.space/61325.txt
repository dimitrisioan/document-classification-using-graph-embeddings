whats
more
if
you
buy
titans
the
prize
money
is
your
entire
return
on
investment
if
you
develop
a
new
launch
system
it
has
other
uses
and
the
prize
is
just
the
icing
on
the
cake

are
still

does
it
as
an
inhouse
project
their
costs
would
look
much
better
than
buying
at

price
better
yes
but
were
not
talking
order
of

can

that
sure
you
can
get
a
heavylift
launcher
fairly
cheap
if
you
do
it
privately
rather
than
as
a
gummint
project
but
were
still
talking
about
something
that
will
cost
nine
