thanks
again
one
final
question
the
name
gehrels
wasnt
known
to

thread
came
up
but
the
may
issue
of
scientific
american
has
an
article
about
the
inconstant
cosmos
with
a
photo
of
neil
gehrels
project
scientist
for
nasas
compton
gamma
ray
observatory
same
person
no
i
estimate
a
probability
the
gehrels
referred
to
is
thomas
gehrels
of
the
spacewatch
project
kitt
peak
observatory
maybe
in
the
th
century
they
could
do
gamma
ray
spectroscopy
on
distant
asteroids
with
an
orbiting
observatory
but
here
in
the
primitive
th
we
have
to
send
a
probe
there
to
get
gamma
ray
spectroscopy
done
