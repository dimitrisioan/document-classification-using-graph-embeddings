nasa
would
provide
contractual
launch
services
however
since
nasa
bases
its
charge
on
seriously
flawed
cost
estimates
wn
mar
the
taxpayers
would
bear
most
of
the
expense
this
may
look
like
environmental
vandalism
but
mike
lawson
ceo
of
space
marketing
told
us
yesterday
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environment
the
platform
will
carry
ozone
monitors
he
explainedadvertising
is
just
to
help
defray
costs
this
may
be
the
purpose
for
the
university
of
colorado
people
my
guess
is
that
the
purpose
for
the
livermore
people
is
to
learn
how
to
build
large
inflatable
space
structures
the
cu
people
have
been
and
continue
to
be
big
ozone
scientists
so
this
is
consistent
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
new
comercial
applications
that
nasa
and
clinton
are
pushing
so
hard
is
nasa
really
supporting
this
junk
did
anyone
catch
the
rocket
that
was
launched
with
a
movie
advert
all
over
it
i
think
the
rocket
people
got
alot
of
for
painting
up
the
sides
with
the
movie
stuff
what
about
the
cokepepsi
thing
a
few
years
back
nasa
has
been
trying
to
find
ways
to
get
other
people
into
the
space
funding
business
for
some
time
frankly
ive
thought
about
trying
it
too
when
the
funding
gets
tight
only
the
innovative
get
funded
one
of
the
things
nasa
is
big
on
is
cofunding
if
a
pi
can
show
cofunding
for
any
proposal
that
proposal
has
a
significantly
higher
probability
of
being
funded
than
a
proposal
with
more
merit
but
no
cofunding
once
again
