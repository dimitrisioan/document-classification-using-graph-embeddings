be
the
site
of
major
commercial
activity
as
far
as
we
know
it
has
no
materials
we
cant
get
cheaper
right
here
on
earth
or
from
asteroids
and
comets
aside
from
the
semimythic
he
that
might
be
useful
in
low
grade
fusion
reactors
problem
with
he
aside
from
the
difficulty
in
making
any
fusion
reactor
work
is
that
its
concentration
in
lunar
regolith
is
just
so
small
on
the
order
of
ppb
or
so
on
average
more
in
some
this
thread
reminds
me
of
wingos
claims
some
time
ago
about
the
moon
as
a
source
of
titanium
for
use
on
earth
as
i
recall
wingo
wasnt
even
of
the
basalts
are
tio
this
is
trillions
of
tons
of
tio
at
concentrations
only
a
factor
of
less
than
in
lunar
highti
basalts
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
disadvantages
of
the
moon
could
be
overcome
by
such
a
small
increase
the
concentration
of
the
ore
never
mind
the
richer
but
less
common
terrestrial
ores
being
mined
today
why
paul
its
obvious
once
chlorine
chemistry
has
been
banned
on
earth
as
is
being
advocated
by
some
groups
ti
prices
will
sharply
increase
we
are
of
course
not
allowed
to
assume
any
developments
in
ti
processing
lunar
ti
will
then
be
eminently
competitive
for
the
trendy
jewelry
market
and
certain
applications
of
national
importance
oops
this
is
scispace
wrong
rules
of
debate
seriously
id
say
there
is
a
flaw
in
garys
analysis
in
that
he
assumes
an
export
oriented
economy
maybe
the
lunatics
will
just
want
some
native
ti
for
local
use
as
to
why
lunar
natives
are
cost
effective
analysis
has
shown
they
will
be
critical
in
providing
a
sheltered
manufacturing
base
technological
innovation
critical
materials
and
manpower
in
the
war
between
the
allies
and
central
powers
in
about
two
hundred
years
steinn

i
saw
two
shooting
stars
last
night
lick
observatory
i
wished
on
them
but
they
were
only
satellites
is
it
wrong
to
wish
on
