announce
that
a
reward
of
billion
would
go
to
the
first
corporation
who
successfully
keeps
at
least
person
alive
on
the
moon
for
a
year
and
with
b
on
offer
the
problem
of
keeping
them
alive
is
highly
likely
to
involve
more
than
just
the
lunar
environment
oh
dear
my
freighter
just
landed
on
the
roof
of
acmes
base
and
they
all
died
how
sad
gosh
that
leaves
us
as
the
oldest
residents
quick
boss
the
slime
from
yoyodyne
are
back
and
this
time
theyve
got
a
tank
man
the
guns
one
could
imagine
all
sorts
of
technologies
being
developed
in
that
sort
of
environment
greg
im
kidding
btw
although
the
problem
of
winnertakesall
prizes
is
that
it
encourages
all
sorts
of
undesirable
behaviour
witness
military
procurement
programs
and
b
is
probably
far
too
small
a
reward
to
encourage
what
would
be
a
very
expensive
and
high
risk
proposition

hey
my
dad
has
an
old
hangar
and
judy
has
some
old
rockets
in
her
attic
lets
put
on
a
lunar
program
sounds
good
but
lets
play
a
game
what
would
be
a
reasonable
reward
what
companies
would
have
a
reasonable
shot
at
pulling
off
such
a
feat
just
where
in
the
budget
would
the
reward
come
from
should
there
be
a
time
limit
would
a
straight
cash
money
award
be
enough
or
should
we
throw
in
say
exclusive
mining
rights
for
the
first
fifty
years
you
get
the
idea
id
like
to
play
but
i
dont
have
a
clue
to
the
answers

freebairn
he
who
refuses
to
understand
math
will
probably
never
get
his
checkbook
figured
out
