has
anyone
ever
heard
of
a
food
product
called
space
food
sticks
this
was
apparently
createdmarketed
around
the
time
of
the
lunar
expeditions
along
with
tang
and
other
dehydrated
foods
i
have
spoken
with
several
people
who
have
eaten
these
before
and
they
described
them
as
a
dehydrated
candy
any
information
would
be
greatly
appreciated

the
actual
taste
sensation
was
like
nothing
you
will
ever
willingly
experience
the
amazing
thing
was
that
we
ate
a
second
one
and
a
third
and
i
doubt
that
they
actually
flew
on
missions
as
im
certain
they
did
bad
things
to
the
gastrointestinal
tract
compared
to
space
food
sticks
tang
was
a
gastronomic
contribution
to
mankind
