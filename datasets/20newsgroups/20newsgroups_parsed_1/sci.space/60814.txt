i
was
reading
popular
science
this
morning
and
was
surprised
by
an
ad
in
the
back
i
know
that
a
lot
of
the
ads
in
the
back
of
ps
are
fringe
science
or
questionablely
legal
but
this
one
really
grabbed
my
attention
it
was
from
a
company
name
personal
missle
inc
or
something
like
that
anyhow
the
ad
stated
that
theyd
sell
rockets
that
were
up
to
in
length
and
engines
of
sizes
f
to
m
they
also
said
that
some
rockets
will
reach
feet
now
aside
from
the
obvious
dangers
to
any
amateur
rocketeer
using
one
of
these
beasts
isnt
this
illegal
i
cant
imagine
the
faa
allowing
people
to
shoot
rockets
up
through
the
flight
levels
of
passenger
planes
not
to
even
mention
the
problem
of
locating
a
rocket
when
it
comes
down
and
no
im
not
going
to
even
think
of
buying
one
im
not
that
crazy
paul
minell
do
feet
and
carries
pounds
of
dynamite
dokas
could
it
be
public
missile
inc
in
michigan
from
the
description
of
ad
here
it
sounds
like
theyre
talking
about
high
power
rocketry
an
outgrowth
of
model
rocketry
this
hobby
uses
nonmetallic
structural
compoments
and
commerically
manufactured
engines
ranging
in
impulse
classification
from
g
to
p
the
hobby
has
been
flourishing
from
early
s
and
is
becoming
increasing
popular
technically
this
is
not
consider
amateur
rocketry
any
rocket
with
a
liftoff
weight
greater
than
pounds
or
using
a
total
impulse
of
g
or
greater
requires
an
faa
waiver
to
launch
typically
a
group
of
people
get
an
faa
waiver
for
specified
period
of
time
ie
week
weekend
etc
at
a
designated
site
and
time
and
all
of
the
launches
are
then
covered
under
this
blanket
waiver
there
is
also
a
high
power
safety
code
which
designates
more
specific
rules
such
as
launch
field
size
etc
finally
in
order
to
purchase
any
of
the
larger
class
b
rocket
motors
you
need
to
certified
through
either
the
national
association
of
rocketry
or
tripoli
rocketry
association
certification
procedures
require
a
demonstarted
handling
and
safe
flight
at
a
total
impulse
level
