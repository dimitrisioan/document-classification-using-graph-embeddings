brian

writes
any
comments
on
the
absorbtion
of
the
office
of
exploration
into
the
office
of
space
sciences
and
the
reassignment
of
griffin
to
the
chief
engineer
position
is
this
just
a
meaningless
administrative
shuffle
or
does
this
bode
ill
for
sei
in
my
opinion
this
seems
like
a
bad
thing
at
least
on
the
surface
griffin
seemed
to
be
someone
who
was
actually
interested
in
getting
things
done
and
who
was
willing
to
look
an
innovative
approaches
to
getting
things
done
faster
better
and
cheaper
its
unclear
to
me
whether
he
will
be
able
to
do
this
at
his
new
position
does
anyone
know
what
his
new
duties
will
be
first
ive
heard
of
it
offhand
griffin
is
no
longer
an
office
head
so
thats
bad
on
the
other
hand
regress
seemed
to
think
we
cant
fund
anything
by
griffin
because
that
would
mean
and
we
have
the
lies
by
the
old
hardliners
about
the
billion
mars
mission
to
prove
it
that
we
would
be
buying
into
a
mission
to
mars
that
would
cost
billion
therefore
there
will
be
no
artemis
or
million
dollar
lunar
orbiter
et
cetera
they
were
killing
griffins
main
program
simply
because
some
sycophants
somewhere
had
congress
beleivin
that
to
do
so
would
simply
be
to
buy
into
the
same
old
stuff
sorta
like
not
giving
aid
to
yeltsin
because
hes
a
communist
hardliner
at
least
now
the
sort
of
reforms
griffin
was
trying
to
bring
forward
wont
be
trapped
in
their
own
little
easily
contained
and
defunded
ghetto
that
griffin
is
staying
in
some
capacity
is
very
very
very
good
and
if
he
brings
something
up
noone
can
say
why
dont
you
go
back
to
the
ose
where
you
belong
and
where
he
couldnt
even
get
money
for
design
studies
phil
fraering
seems
like
every
day
we
find
out
all
sorts
of
stuff
how
the
ancient
mayans
had
televison
repo
man
