overview
you
may
be
reading
this
document
on
any
one
of
an
amazing
variety
of
computers
so
much
of
the
material
below
may
not
apply
to
you
in
general
however
systems
connected
to
the
net
fall
in
one
of
three
categories
internet
usenet
or
bitnet
electronic
mail
may
be
sent
between
these
networks
and
other
resources
available
on
one
of
these
networks
are
sometimes
accessible
from
other
networks
by
email
sent
to
special
servers
the
space
and
astronomy
discussion
groups
actually
are
composed
of
several
mechanisms
with
mostly
transparent
connections
between
them
one
mechanism
is
the
mailing
list
in
which
mail
is
sent
to
a
central
distribution
point
which
relays
it
to
all
recipients
of
the
list
in
addition
to
the
general
lists
for
space
called
space
digest
for
internet
users
and
space
on
bitnet
there
are
a
number
of
more
specialized
mailing
lists
described
below
a
second
mechanism
is
usenet
netnews
this
is
somewhat
like
a
bulletin
board
operating
on
each
system
which
is
a
part
of
the
net
netnews
separates
contributions
into
hundreds
of
different
categories
based
on
a
group
name
the
groups
dealing
most
closely
with
space
topics
are
called
scispacenews
scispace
scispaceshuttle
sciastro
and
talkpoliticsspace
contributors
post
submissions
called
articles
in
netnews
terminology
on
their
local
machine
which
sends
it
to
other
nearby
machines
similarly
articles
sent
from
nearby
machines
are
stored
locally
and
may
be
forwarded
to
other
systems
so
that
an
article
is
posted
locally
and
eventually
reaches
all
the
usenet
sites
interested
in
receiving
the
news
group
to
which
the
article
was
posted
gateway
machines
redirect
the
usenet
scispace
group
into
internet
and
bitnet
mailing
lists
and
vice
versa
the
other
usenet
groups
are
not
accessible
as
mailing
lists
if
you
can
receive
netnews
its
more
flexible
interface
and
access
to
a
wider
range
of
material
usually
make
it
the
preferred
option

lists

the
main
