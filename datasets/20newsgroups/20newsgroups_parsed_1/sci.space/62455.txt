to

that
visible
light
astronomy
is
already
a
dying
field
is
pure
hokum
to
use
the
logic
that
things
are
already
bad
so
it
doesnt
matter
if
it
gets
worse
is
absurd
maybe
common

ok
so
those
scientists
can
get
around
the
atmosphere
with
fancy
computer
algorythims
but
have
you
looked
ad
the
hubble
results
the
defects
of
the
mirror
are
partially
correctable
with
software
see
those
jupiter
pictures
for
results
but
is
the
effects
are
completely
reversable
why
is
there
going
to
be
a
shuttle
mission
to
fix
it

the
main
effect
of
the
spherical
aberration
problems
with
the
primary
mirror
was
to
drive
the
computer
engineers
to
develop
the
image
processing
software
that
much
faster
when
they
use
the
same
deconvolution
software
on
the
images
from
the
fixed
hubble
be
ready
for
some
incredible
results
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
results
will
exceed
the
original
specs
by
a
fair
margin
adaptive

not

as
is
the
case
with

you
might
be
interested
to
know
this
technology
has
made
it
to

the
ao
adaptive

system
comes
in
a
handy

case
that
a
threeyearold
could
carry
around
even
though
this
device
is
really
only
good
for
the
brightest
objects
it
could
cope
with
image
movements
of
up
to
millimeter
in
the

focal
plane
now
just
imagine
how
well
this
infant
technology
will
do
in
a
few
years
especially
in
a
dedicated
system
that
has
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
many
manhours
invested
in
its
development
