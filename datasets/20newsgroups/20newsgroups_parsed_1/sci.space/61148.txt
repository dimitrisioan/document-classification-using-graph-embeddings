will
someone
tell
an
ignorant
physicist
where
the
term
level
comes
from
it
sounds
like
the
risks
digest
equivalent
of
large
extra
large
jumbo
or
maybe
its
like
defcon
i
gather
it
means
that
shuttle
software
was
developed
with
extreme
care
to
have
reliablility
and
safety
and
almost
everything
else
in
the
computing
world
is
level
or
cheesy
dimestore
software
not
surprising
but
who
is
it
that
invents
this
standard
and
how
come
everyone
but

be
familiar
with
it
