the
problem
with
oort
cloud
sources
is
that
absolutely
no
plausible
mechanism
has
been
proposed
it
would
have
to
involve
new
physics
as
far
as
i
can
tell
closest
to
conventional
oort
sources
is
a
model
of
bfield
pinching
by
comets
its
got
too
many
holes
in
it
to
count
but
at
least
it
was
a
good
try
so
you
have
a
plausible
model
for
grbs
at
astronomical
distances
recent
observations
have
just
about
ruled
out
the
merging
neutron
star
hypothesis
which
had
a
lot
of
problems
anyhow
we
have
to
look
for
implausible
models
and
what
is
fundamentally
allowed
independent
of
models
a
paper
on
the
possibility
of
grbs
in
the
oort
cloud
just
came
through
the
astrophysics
abstract
service
to
get
a
copy
of
this
paper
send
a
message
to
with
the
subject
line
get
here
is
the
abstract
of
that
paper
the
currently
favored
explanation
for
the
origin
of
grbs
puts
them
at
cosmological
distances
but
as
long
as
there
is
no
distance
indicator
to
these
events
all
possible
sources
which
are
isotropically
distributed
should
remain
under
consideration
this
is
why
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
is
kept
on
the
list
although
there
is
no
known
mechanism
for
generating
grbs
from
cometary
nuclei
unlikely
as
it
may
seem
the
possibility
that
grbs
originate
in
the
solar
cometary
cloud
can
not
be
excluded
until
it
is
disproved
we
use
the
available
data
on
the
distribution
of
grbs
the
batse
catalogue
up
to
march
and
the
catalogue
of
cometary
orbits
by
marsden
and
williams
to
investigate
whether
there
is
any
observational
indication
for
correlations
between
the
angular
distributions
of
grbs
and
comets
aphelia
assuming
that
the
distribution
of
aphelia
direction
reflect
at
least
to
some
extent
true
variations
in
the
column
density
of
the
oort
cloud
we
also
apply
the
vov
test
to
both
distributions
we
have
performed
a
variety
of
statistical
tests
a
kolmogorovsmirnov
test
for
the
distributions
in
galactic
latitude
a
chi
test
for
the
spherical
multiple
moments
and
a
d
crosscorrelation
analysis
including
testing
subsamples
for
isolating
the
effect
of
possible
observational
biases
these
tests
imply
that
it
is
unlikely
that
the
two
distributions
agree
but
the
statistical
significance
is
not
sufficient
for
ruling
out
any
connection
with
complete
confidence
we
performed
montecarlo
simulations
which
show
that
only
when
the
number
of
bursts
exceeds
sim
it
is
possible
to
rule
out
a
correlation
between
the
angular
distributions
currently
it
is
only
the
combination
of
these
tests
with
the
large
disagreement
found
for
the
vov
parameter
which
makes
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
unlikely
to
be
related
to
grbs
