havent

any
specifics
on

i
cant
see
why
the
mass
margins
are
tight
what
are

gyros
solar

probably
a

all

equipment

as

fuel
and
consumables
as
they
can
this
should
be
lighter
than
the
original
hst
deployment
mission
which
achieved
the
highest
altitude
for
a
shuttle
mission
to
date
and
hst
is
now
in
a
lower

seems
like
the
limiting
factors
would
be
crew
fatigue
and
mission
complexity
steve

one
thing
to
recall
putting
a
satellite
as
high
as
possible
is
one
thing
coming
back
to
not
only
that
altitude
but
matching
the
position
of
it
in
its
orbit
on
a
subsequent
mission
is
another
thing
any
misalignment
of
the
plane
of
the
orbit
during
launch
or
being
ahead
or
behind
the
target
will
require
more
fuel
to
adjust
this
was
considered
in
the
original
deployment
i
agree
though
that
the
demands
on
the
crew
and
complexity
are
stupendous
one
has
to
admire
how
much
they
are
trying
to
do
