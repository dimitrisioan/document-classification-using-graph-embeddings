teflon
so
your
eggs
dont
stick
in
the
pan
sorry
to
split
hairs
but
i
just
read
in
the
making
of
the
atomic
bomb
that
teflon
was
developed
during
world
war
a
sealant
was
needed
for
the
tubing
in
which
uranium
hexafluoride
passed
as
it
was
gradually
enriched
by
difussion
uf
is
very
corrosive
and
some
very
inert
yet
flexible
material
was
needed
for
the
seals
i
think
youre
both
right
teflon
was
actually
discovered
by
accident
before
wwii
from
what
ive
heard
they
had
some
chemical
i
assume
it
was
tetrafluoroethylene
in
a
tank
and
but
the
valve
got
gummed
up
cutting
it
open
revealed
that
it
had
polymerized
the
material
was
useful
for
seals
but
it
had
a
major
problem
for
say
the
linings
of
vessels
it
wouldnt
stick
to
metal
what
the
space
program
did
was
to
find
a
way
to
get
it
to
stick
thus
we
had
nostick
frypans
on
the
market
in
the
late
s
dan
