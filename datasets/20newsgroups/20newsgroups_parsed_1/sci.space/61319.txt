i
didnt
want
to
quote
all
the
stuff
thats
been
said
recently
i
just
wanted
to
add
a
point
then
enforces
those
rights
for
them
here
in
the
us
the
constitution
provides
a
bill
of
rights
from
which
most
if
not
all
legal
rights
are
considered
to
derive
im
sure
that
most
other
countries
have
these
seem
hardly
like
the
groups
to
discuss
this
in
but
huh
all
legitimate
power
to
enforce
these
rights
derives
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
not
from
no
steenkin
piece
of
paper
civilized
govmnt
is
not
an
autonomous
computer
program
its
interactive
the
constitution
was
made
by
the
people
and
can
be
trashed
by
us
it
aint
no
sacred
scripture
from
which
rights
flow
our
rights
come
from
our
souls
and
i
sure
didnt
see
any
request
to
vote
on
trashing
the
sky
again
my
opinion
only
we
keep
our
rights
by
using
them
not
going
to
some
court
comparable
documents
if
you
can
persuade
a
court
that
you
have
a
right
to
a
dark
sky
derived
in
some
manner
from
the
bill
of
rights
in
the
us
you
can
prevent
maybe
these
billboards
from
being
launched
to
keep
anyone
in
the
world
from
launching
then
gets
into
international
law
and
the
international
court
of
justice
correct
name
in
the
hague
something
i
know
little
about

gracious
