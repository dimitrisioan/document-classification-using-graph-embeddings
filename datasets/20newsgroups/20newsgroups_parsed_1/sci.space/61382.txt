try
to
land
a
shuttle
with
that
big
huge
telescope
in
the
back
and
you
could
have
problems
the
shuttle
just
isnt
designed
to
land
with
that
much
weight
in
the
payload
is
hst
really
that
much
heavier
than
a
spacelab
i
cant
speak
to
sheer
mass
but
part
of
the
problem
is
that
hst
wasnt
built
to
ever
be
brought
back
down
its
not
built
for
those
kinds
of
jolt
forces
and
there
is
no
support
cradle
for
it
which
is
additional
weight
that
would
be
required
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
