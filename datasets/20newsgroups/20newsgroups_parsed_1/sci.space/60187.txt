ssf
redesign
constellation
ssf
is
up
for
redesign
again
lets
do
it
right
this
time
lets
step
back
and
consider
the
functionality
we
want
microgravityvacuum
process
research
life
sciences
research
adaptation
to
space
spacecraft
maintenence
the
old
nasa
approach
explified
by
shuttle
and
ssf
so
far
was
to
centralize
functionality
these
projects
failed
to
meet
their
targets
by
a
wide
margin
the
military
and
commercial
users
took
most
of
their
payloads
off
shuttle
after
wasting
much
effort
to
tie
their
payloads
to
it
and
ssf
has
crumbled
into
disorganization
and
miscommunication
over
billion
has
been
spent
on
these
two
projects
with
no
reduction
in
launch
costs
and
littel
improvement
in
commercial
space
industrialization
meanwhile
military
and
commercial
users
have
come
up
with
a
superior
strategy
for
space
development
the
constellation
firstly
different
functions
are
broken
down
into
different
constellations
placed
in
the
optimal
orbit
for
each
function
thus
we
have
the
gpsnavstar
constellation
in
hour
orbits
comsats
in
clarke
and
molniya
orbits
etc
secondly
the
task
is
distributed
amongst
several
spacecraft
in
a
constellation
providing
for
redundancy
and
full
coverage
where
needed
ssfs
main
functions
require
quite
different
environments
and
are
also
prime
candidates
for
constellization
we
have
the
makings
of
a
microgravity
constellation
now
comet
and
mir
for
longduration
flights
shuttlespacelab
for
shortduration
flights
the
best
strategy
for
this
area
is
inexpensive
incremental
improvement
installation
of
us
facilities
on
mir
shuttlemir
linkup
and
transition
from
shuttlespacelab
to
a
much
less
expensive
sstospacehabcomet
or
sstosifcomet
we
might
also
expand
the
research
program
to
take
advantage
of
interesting
space
environments
eg
the
highradiation
van
allen
belt
or
gasplasma
gradients
in
comet
tails
the
comet
system
can
be
much
more
easily
retrofitted
for
these
tasks
where
a
station
is
too
large
to
affordably
launch
beyond
leo
we
need
to
study
life
sciences
not
just
in
microgravity
but
also
in
lunar
and
martian
gravities
and
in
the
radiation
environments
of
deep
space
instead
of
the
protected
shelter
of
leo
this
is
a
very
longterm
lowpriority
project
since
astronauts
will
have
little
practical
use
in
the
space
program
until
costs
come
down
orders
of
magnitude
furthermore
using
astronauts
severely
restricts
the
scope
of
the
investigation
and
the
sample
size
so
i
propose
labratsat
a
constellation
tetherbolo
satellites
that
test
out
various
levels
of
gravity
in
supervanallenbelt
orbits
that
are
representative
of
the
radiation
environment
encountered
on
earthmoon
earthmars
earthasteroid
etc
trips
the
miniaturized
life
support
machinery
might
be
operated
realtime
from
earth
thru
a
vr
interface
after
several
orbital
missions
have
been
flown
followons
can
act
as
ldefs
on
the
lunar
and
martian
surface
testing
out
the
actual
environment
at
low
cost
before
billions
are
spent
on
astronauts
by
far
the
largest
market
for
spacecraft
servicing
is
in
clarke
orbit
i
propose
a
fleet
of
small
teleoperated
robots
and
small
test
satellites
on
which
ground
engineers
can
practice
their
skills
once
in
place
robots
can
pry
stuck
solar
arrays
and
antennas
attach
solar
battery
power
packs
inject
fuel
etc
once
the
fleet
is
working
it
can
be
spun
off
to
commercial
companys
who
can
work
with
the
comsat
companies
to
develop
comsat
replaceable
module
standards
by
applying
the
successful
constellation
strategy
and
getting
rid
of
the
failed
centralized
strategy
of
sts
and
old
ssf
we
have
radically
improved
the
capability
of
the
program
while
greatly
cutting
its
cost
for
a
fraction
of
ssfs
pricetag
we
can
fix
satellites
where
the
satellites
are
we
can
study
lifes
adaptation
to
a
much
large
more
representative
variety
of
space
environments
and
we
can
do
microgravity
and
vacuum
research
inexpensively
and
if
needed
in
specialpurpose
orbits
nb
we
can
apply
the
constellation
strategy
to
space
exploration
as
well
greatly
cutting
its
cost
and
increasing
its
functionality
mars
network
and
artemis
are
two
good
examples
of
this
more
ambitiously
we
can
set
up
a
network
of
native
propellant
plants
on
mars
that
can
be
used
to
fuel
planetwide
roverballistic
hopper
prospecting
and
sample
return
the
descendants
of
labratsats
technology
can
be
used
as
a
mars
surface
ldef
and
to
test
out
closedecology
greenhouses
on
mars
at
low
cost
