re
i
want
that
billion
in
article
henry
spencer
writes
only
if
he
doesnt
spend
more
than
a
billion
dollars
doing
it
since
the
prize
is
not
going
to
be
scaled
up
to
match
the
level
of
effort
you
can
spend
a
billion
pretty
quickly
buying
titan
launches
fine
ill
buy
from
george
georgeee
that
assumes
i
cant
weasel
out
a
cooperative
venture
of
some
sort
cut
me
a
break
on
the
launcher
ill
cut
you
in
on
the
proceeds
if
it
works
only
the
government
pays
higherthanlist
price
whats
more
if
you
buy
titans
the
prize
money
is
your
entire
return
on
investment
if
you
develop
a
new
launch
system
it
has
other
uses
and
the
prize
is
just
the
icing
on
the
cake
unless
youre
martin
marietta
since
as
i
recall
they
bought
out
the
gd
line
of
aerospace
products
if
mmgd
does
it
as
an
inhouse
project
their
costs
would
look
much
better
than
buying
at
list
price
does
anyone
really
know
the
profit
margins
built
in
to
the
titan
cmon
allen
is
telling
us
how
cheap
we
can
get
improved
this
or
that
i
doubt
very
much
that
a
billiondollar
prize
is
going
to
show
enough
return
to
justify
the
investment
if
you
are
constrained
to
use
current
us
launchers
oh
please
how
much
of
a
profit
do
you
want
pulling
million
after
all
is
said
and
done
wouldnt
be
too
shabby
not
to
mention
the
other
goodies
ill
collect
in
a
movie
tv
rights
say
million
conservatively
b
advertising
look
mommie
theyre
drinking
coke
c
intangibles
name
recognization
experience
data
acculumated
youre
going
to
have
to
invest
your
front
money
in
building
a
new
launch
system
rather
than
pissing
it
away
on
existing
ones
being
there
first
is
of
no
importance
if
you
go
bankrupt
doing
it
if
you
want
lean
fine
a
million
prize
would
be
more
than
adequate
for
a
prize
maybe
wales
would
be
kind
enough
to
define
what
a
company
would
consider
a
decent
profit
if
you
want
rd
done
youll
have
to
write
in
rd
clauses
i
suppose
you
could
make
it
a
sbir
setaside
software
engineering
thats
like
military
intelligence
isnt
it
