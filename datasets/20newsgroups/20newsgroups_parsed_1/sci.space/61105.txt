actually
if
memory
serves
the
atlas
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
old
titan
icbm
nope
youre
confusing
separate
programs
atlas
was
the
firstgeneration
us
icbm
titan
i
was
the
secondgeneration
one
titan
ii
which
all
the
titan
launchers
are
based
on
was
the
thirdgeneration
heavy
icbm
there
was
essentially
nothing
in
common
between
these
three
programs
yes
three
programs
despite
the
similarity
of
names
titan
i
and
titan
ii
were
completely
different
missiles
they
didnt
even
use
the
same
fuels
never
mind
the
same
launch
facilities
if
so
theres
probably
quite
a
few
old
pads
albeit
in
need
of
some
serious
reconditioning
still
being
able
to
buy
the
turf
and
pad
and
bunkers
including
prep
facility
at
midwest
farmland
prices
strikes
me
as
pretty
damned
cheap
sorry
the
titan
silos
a
cant
handle
the
titan
launchers
with
their
large
srbs
b
cant
handle
any
sort
of
launcher
without
massive
violations
of
normal
rangesafety
rules
nobody
cares
about
such
things
in
the
event
of
a
nuclear
war
but
in
peacetime
they
matter
and
c
were
scrapped
years
ago
