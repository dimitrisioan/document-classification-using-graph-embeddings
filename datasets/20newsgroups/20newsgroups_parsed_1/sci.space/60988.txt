vehicle
arrived
at
the

is
ok

my
opinion
as
long
as
the
stuff
returns
to
earth
what
do
you
think
of
this
revolting
and
hideous
attempt
to
vandalize
the
night
sky

this
turns
out
to
be
true
its
time
to
get
seriously
active
in
terrorism
this
is
unbelievable
who
do
those
people
think

stupidity
wins
i
guess
thats
true
and
if

by
pure
numbers
