servicing

the
limit
on
spacewalking
is
a
function
of
suit
supplies
mass
and
orbiter
duration
in
order
to
perform
the
reboost
of
the
hst
the
oms
engines
will
be
fired
for
a
long
period
now
the
shuttle
is
a
heavy
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
oms
fuel
needed
to
fly
both
up
is
substantial
a
small
booster
carried
up
and
used
to
boost
hst
on
its
own
will
weigh
significantly
less
then
the
oms
fuel
required
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttle
for
a
given
orbital
change
from
what
i
understand
the
mass
margins
on
the
hst
missions
are
tight
enough
they
cant
even
carry
extra
suits
or
mmus
pat
i
havent
seen
any
specifics
on
the
hst
repair
mission
but
i
cant
see
why
the
mass
margins
are
tight
what
are
they
carrying
up
replacement
components
wfpc
ii
costar
gyros
solar
panels
and
probably
a
few
others
all
sorts
of
tools
eva
equipment
and
as
much
oms
fuel
and
consumables
as
they
can
this
should
be
lighter
than
the
original
hst
deployment
mission
which
achieved
the
highest
altitude
for
a
shuttle
mission
to
date
and
hst
is
now
in
a
lower
orbit
seems
like
the
limiting
factors
would
be
crew
fatigue
and
mission
complexity
