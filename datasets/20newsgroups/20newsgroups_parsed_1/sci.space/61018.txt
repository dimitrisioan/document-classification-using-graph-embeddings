new
in
my
opinion
friday

washington

space
billboards
is
this
one
the
spinoffs
we
were
promised
in
science
fiction
writer
robert
heinlein
published
the
man
who
sold
the
moon
which
involved
a
dispute
over
the
sale
of
rights
to
the
moon
for
use
as
billboard
nasa
has
taken
the
firsteps
toward
this
hideous
vision
of
the
future
observers
were
startled
this
spring
when
a
nasa
launch
vehicle
arrived
at
the
pad
with
schwarzenegger
painted
in
huge
block
letters
on
the
side
of
the
booster
rockets
space
marketing
inc
had
arranged
for
the
ad
to
promote
arnolds
latest
movie
well
if
youre
going
to
get
upset
with
this
you
might
as
well
direct
some
of
this
moral
outrage
towards
glavcosmos
as
well
they
pioneered
this
capitalist
application
of
booster
adverts
long
before
nasa
sign
of
the
times
a
sony
logo
on
a
soyuz
launcher
now
space
marketing
is
working
with
university
of
colorado
and
livermore
engineers
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflatable
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
this
sounds
like
something
lowell
wood
would
think
of
does
anyone
know
if
hes
involved
nasa
would
provide
contractual
launch
services
however
since
nasa
bases
its
charge
on
seriously
flawed
cost
estimates
wn
mar
the
taxpayers
would
bear
most
of
the
expense
this
may
look
like
environmental
vandalism
but
mike
lawson
ceo
of
space
marketing
told
us
yesterday
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environment
the
platform
will
carry
ozone
monitors
he
explainedadvertising
is
just
to
help
defray
costs
this
may
be
the
purpose
for
the
university
of
colorado
people
my
guess
is
that
the
purpose
for
the
livermore
people
is
to
learn
how
to
build
large
inflatable
space
structures
what
do
you
think
of
this
revolting
and
hideous
attempt
to
vandalize
the
night
sky
it
is
not
even
april
anymore
if
this
is
true
i
think
its
a
great
idea
learning
how
to
build
to
build
structures
in
space
in
an
essential
step
towards
space
development
and
given
that
freedom
appears
to
be
shrinking
towards
the
vanishing
point
i
question
whether
nasas
space
station
is
going
to
provide
much
if
any
knowledge
in
this
area
especially
if
a
design
such
as
fagets
wingless
orbiter
is
chosen
if
such
a
project
also
monitors
ozone
depletion
and
demonstrates
creative
use
of
partial
private
sector
funding
in
the
process
so
much
the
better
is
nasa
really
supporting
this
junk
and
does
anyone
have
any
more
details
other
than
what
was
in
the
wn
news
blip
how
serious
is
this
project
is
this
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
does
it
have
real
funding
are
protesting
groups
being
organized
in
the
states
not
yet
though
if
this
project
goes
through
i
suppose
the
return
of
jeremy
rifkin
is
inevitable
