how
can
you
see
the
launch
of
the
space
shuttle
sorry
for
asking
a
question
thats
not
entirely
based
on
the
technical
aspects
of
space
but
i
couldnt
find
the
answer
on
the
faqs
im
currently
in
the
uk
which
makes
seeing
a
space
shuttle
launch
a
little
difficult
however
i
have
been
selected
to
be
an
exchange
student
at
louisiana
state
uni
from
august
and
i
am
absolutely
determined
to
get
to
see
a
space
shuttle
launch
sometime
during
the
year
at
which
i
will
be
in
america
i
hear
theres
a
bit
of
a
long
mailing
list
so
if
someone
can
tell
me
how
to
get
tickets
and
where
to
get
them
from
then
please
email
me
thanks
very
much
for
your
patience
and
if
anyone
else
wants
to
know
tell
me
and
ill
summarize
for
you
just
to
save
all
those
poor
people
who
have
to
pay
for
their
links
april
is
the
cruellest
month
