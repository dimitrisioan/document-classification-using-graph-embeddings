given
that
what
i
described
for
the
hst
seemed
to
be
the
smt
and
given
the
mass
amrgins
on
the
discovery
mission
is
tight
enough
that
spacewalking
has
to
be
carefully
constrained
no
edo
pallets
no
spare
suits
no
extra
mmus
why
not
do
this
quick
test
goldins
philosophjy
of
faster
cheaper
better
build
a
real
fast
space
tug
to
handle
the
reboost
of
the
hst
using
clean
cryo
fuels
and
get
it
ready
before
the
hst
mission
if
nasa
could
build
mercury
in
months
they
should
be
able
to
make
an
smt
in
how
much
would
it
need
guidance
package
use
a
voyager
spare
thruster
gear
use
ho
or
loxlh
bus
use
a
commsat
grapple
fixture
use
a
stripped
down
canadarm
comms
package
spare
xband
omni
gear
pat
and
then
why
not
build
a
space
dock
either
inflated
or
not
some
place
a
crew
can
work
on
a
item
without
having
to
wear
much
of
the
items
they
have
to
for
spae
such
as
most
of
he
bulky
suit
more
idea
to
come
