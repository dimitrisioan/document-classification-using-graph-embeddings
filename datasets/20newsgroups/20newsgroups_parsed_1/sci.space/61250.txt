on
april
a
noop
command
was
sent
to
reset
the
command
loss
timer
to
hours
its
planned
value
during
this
mission
phase
this
activity
is
regularly
reported
in
rons
interesting
posts
could
someone
explain
what
the
command
loss
timer
is
the
name
is
rather
descriptive
its
a
command
to
the
spacecraft
that
tells
it
if
you
dont
hear
from
earth
after
hours
assume
something
is
wrong
with
your
the
spacecraft
attitude
and
go
into
a
preprogrammed
search
mode
in
an
attempt
to
reacquire
the
signal
from
earth
the
spacecraft
and
earth
are
not
in
constant
communication
with
each
other
earth
monitors
the
telemetry
from
the
spacecraft
and
if
everything
is
fine
theres
no
reason
to
send
it
any
new
information
but
from
the
spacecrafts
point
of
view
no
information
from
earth
could
mean
either
everything
is
fine
or
that
the
spacecraft
has
lost
signal
acquisition
just
how
long
should
the
spacecraft
wait
before
it
decides
that
something
is
wrong
and
begins
to
take
corrective
action
that
how
long
is
the
command
loss
timer
during
relatively
inactive
cruise
phases
the
command
loss
timer
can
be
set
to
rather
long
values
in
this
case
earth
is
telling
galileo
expect
to
hear
back
from
us
sometime
within
the
next
hours
