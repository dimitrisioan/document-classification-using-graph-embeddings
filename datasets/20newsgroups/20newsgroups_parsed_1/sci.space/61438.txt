i
expect
that
retrieving
hst
would
involve
damaging
it
considerably
in

to
return
it
to
its
cradle
in

bay
most
of
the
deployed
items
antennas
and
especially
the
solar
arays
probably
are
not
retractable
into
their
fully
stowed
position
even
by
hand
no
the
thing
is
designed
to
be
retrievable
in
a
pinch
indeed
this
dictated
a
rather
odd
design
for
the
solar
arrays
since
they
had
to
be
retractable
as
well
as
extendable
and
may
thus
have
indirectly
contributed
to
the
arrayflapping
problems
the
retrieval
problems
are
exactly
as
stated
it
would
be
costly
would
involve
extensive
downtime
and
the
worry
of
someone
finding
a
reason
not
to
relaunch
it
and
would
unnecessarily
expose
the
telescope
to
a
lot
of
mechanical
stresses
and
possibilities
for
contamination
