is
it
not
also
an
abomination
that
somebody
would
spend
money
on
space
advertising
when
those
children
are
starving
perhaps
some
redistribution
of
wealth
would
help
them
this
is
specious
emotionalism
commercial
enterprises
typically
dont
spend
money
on
starving
children
or
other
world
problems
anyway
at

not
in
excess
of
whatever
minimum
amount
is
required
for
lip
service

precisely
where
would
you
place
the
threshold
beyond
which
advertising
spending
is
deemed
abominable
and
why
yes
just
take
money
from
the
profitable
commercial
enterprises
and
give
it
to
the
government
to
redistribute
government
is
so
much
more
efficient
trustworthy
and
noble
than
selfserving
businesses
lets
nip
this
redistributionist
ignorance
in
the
bud
if
it
were
not
for
commercial
enterprises
the
whole
world
would
be
starving
