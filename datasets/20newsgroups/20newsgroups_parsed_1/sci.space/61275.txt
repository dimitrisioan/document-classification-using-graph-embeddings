it
has
been
known
for
quite
a
while
that
the
earth
is
actually
more
pear
shaped
than

does
anyone
make
a
globe
that
is
accurate
as
to

thanks
in
advance
even
if
they
did
a
globe
at
a
scale
that
you
could
fit
into
your
average
room
or
even
average
hall
the
deviations
you
mention
would
not
be
visually
evident
in
other
words
a
micrometer
would
be
required
to
test
the
fact
that
the
globe
was
infact
pearshaped
