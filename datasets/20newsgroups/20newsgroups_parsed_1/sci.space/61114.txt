re
crazy
or
just
imaginitive
writes
so
some
of
my
ideas
are
a
bit
odd
off
the
wall
and
such
but
so
was
wilbur
and
orville
wright
and
quite
a
few
others
sorry
if
i
do
not
have
the
big
degrees
and
such
but
i
think
i
might
be
wrong
to
error
is
human
i
have
something
that
is
in
many
ways
just
as
important
i
have
imagination
dreams
and
without
dreams
all
the
knowledge
is
worthless
oh
and
us
with
the
big
degrees
dont
got
imagination
huh
the
alleged
dichotomy
between
imagination
and
knowledge
is
one
of
the
most
pernicious
fallacys
of
the
new
age
michael
thanks
for
the
generous
offer
but
we
have
quite
enough
dreams
of
our
own
thank
you
you
on
the
other
hand
are
letting
your
own
dreams
go
to
waste
by
failing
to
get
the
mathsthermodynamicschemistryyour
choices
here
which
would
give
your
imagination
wings
just
to
show
this
isnt
a
flame
i
leave
you
with
a
quote
from
invasion
of
the
body
snatchers
become
one
of
us
its
not
so
bad

know
