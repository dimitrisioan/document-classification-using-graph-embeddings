days
the
december
flight
of
endeavour
on
space
shuttle
mission
sts
to
service
the
hubble
space
telescope
hst
has
been
scheduled
as
an
day
mission
designed
to
accommodate
a
record
five
spacewalks
with
the
capability
for
an
additional
two
if
needed
the
decision
to
schedule
five
extravehicular
activities
or
evas
was
reached
following
extensive
evaluations
of
underwater
training
maneuver
times
required
using
the
shuttles
robot
arm
based
on
software
simulations
and
actual
eva
tasks
on
previous
missions
basically
what
weve
done
by
going
to
five
evas
rather
than
three
is
to
repackage
our
margin
so
that
we
have
the
capability
to
respond
to
the
dynamics
or
unknowns
of
spacewalks
mission
director
randy
brinkley
said
it
improves
the
probabilities
for
mission
success
while
providing
added
flexibility
and
adaptability
for
reacting
to
realtime
situations
in
laying
out
the
specific
tasks
to
be
completed
on
each
of
the
spacewalks
officials
have
determined
that
changing
out
the
gyros
solar
arrays
and
the
wide
fieldplanetary
camera
wfpc
and
installing
the
corrective
optics
space
telescope
axial
replacement
costar
are
priority
objectives
during
the
mission
when
we
looked
at
accomplishing
all
of
the
tasks
highest
through
lowest
priority
and
recognizing
that
the
major
tasks
gyros
solar
arrays
wfpc
and
costar
would
consume
most
of
the
time
set
aside
for
each
spacewalk
five
evas
were
deemed
appropriate
said
milt
heflin
lead
flight
director
for
the
mission
while
the
five
spacewalks
will
be
unprecedented
the
use
of
two
alternating
spacewalk
teams
will
alleviate
placing
more
stress
on
the
crew
than
previous
missions
requiring
two
three
or
four
evas
we
have
paid
close
attention
to
lessons
learned
during
previous
spacewalks
and
factored
these
into
our
timeline
estimates
for
five
evas
heflin
said
in
planning
for
all
space
shuttle
missions
it
is
necessary
to
formulate
a
work
schedule
that
represents
as
realistic
a
timeline
as
possible
to
accomplish
the
mission
objectives
planning
currently
calls
for
at
least
five
water
tank
training
sessions
that
include
support
from
the
mission
control
center
called
joint
integrated
simulations
lasting
between
and
hours
in
addition
many
stand
alone
underwater
training
runs
will
practice
individual
tasks
in
each
spacewalk
various
refinements
to
the
specific
tasks
on
each
spacewalk
will
be
made
based
on
actual
training
experience
during
the
months
prior
to
the
mission
also
lessons
learned
from
other
spacewalks
leading
up
to
the
flight
will
be
valuable
in
assisting
the
sts
crew
in
its
training
techniques
endeavours
june
flight
and
discoverys
july
mission
both
will
include
spacewalks
to
evaluate
some
of
the
unique
tools
to
be
used
on
the
hst
mission
the
evaluations
will
help
in
better
understanding
the
differences
between
the
actual
weightlessness
of
space
and
the
ground
training
in
the
water
tanks
at
the
johnson
space
center
houston
and
the
marshall
space
flight
center
huntsville
ala
also
the
inflight
spacewalking
experiences
will
assist
in
gaining
further
insight
into
the
time
required
for
the
various
tasks
and
expand
the
experience

the
