not
give
g
all
of
this
talk
about
a
commercial
space
race
ie
g
to
the
first
year
moon
base
is
intriguing
similar
prizes
have
influenced
aerospace
development
before
the
k
orteig
prize
helped
lindbergh
sell
his
spirit
of
saint
louis
venture
to
his
financial
backers
if
memory
serves
the
k
prize
would
not
have
been
enough
to
totally
reimburse
some
of
the
more
expensive
transatlantic
projects
such
as
fokkers
nungesser
and
other
multiengine
projects
however
lindbergh
ultimately
kept
his
total
costs
below
that
amount
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
his
saint
louis
backers
had
the
foresight
to
realize
that
much
more
was
at
stake
than
could
it
work
with
the
moon
who
are
the
farsighted
financial
backers
of
today
