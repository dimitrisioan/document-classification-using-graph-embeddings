how
hard
or
easy
would
it
be
to
have
a
combo
mission
such
as
a
solar
sail
on
the
way
out
to
the
outer
planets
but
once
in
near
to
orbit
to
use
more
normal
means
if
youve
got
a
good
propulsion
system
thats
not
useful
for
deceleration
sure
you
can
use
chemical
rockets
for
that
part
but
even
just
doing
the
deceleration
chemically
is
a
major
headache
were
talking
seriously
high
cruising
velocities
taking
the
velocity
down
nearly
to
zero
for
a
pluto
orbit
isnt
easy
with
chemical
fuels
incidentally
solar
sails
are
not
going
to
be
suitable
as
the
acceleration
system
for
something
like
this
they
dont
go
anywhere
quickly
i
speak
as
head
of
mission
planning
for
the
canadian
solar
sail
project
although
that
is
more
or
less
an
honorary
title
right
now
because
cssp
is
dormant
they
cant
fly
a
mission
like
this
unless
you
start
talking
about
very
advanced
systems
that
drop
in
very
close
to
the
sun
first
svr
resembles
a
highspeed
