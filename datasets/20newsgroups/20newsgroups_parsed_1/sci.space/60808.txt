big

writes
anyhow
the
ad
stated
that
theyd
sell
rockets
that
were
up
to
in
length
and
engines
of
sizes
f
to
m
they
also
said
that
some
rockets
will
reach
feet
now
aside
from
the
obvious
dangers
to
any
amateur
rocketeer
using
one
of
these
beasts
isnt
this
illegal
i
cant
imagine
the
faa
allowing
people
to
shoot
rockets
up
through
the
flight
levels
of
passenger
planes
the
situation
in
this
regard
has
changed
considerably
in
recent
years
see
the
discussion
of
highpower
rocketry
in
the
recmodelsrockets
frequentlyaskedquestions
list
this
is
not
hardware
you
can
walk
in
off
the
street
and
buy
you
need
proper
certification
that
can
be
had
mostly
through
tripoli
the
high
power
analog
of
the
nar
although
the
nar
is
cautiously
moving
to
extend
the
upper
boundaries
of
what
it
considers
proper
too
you
need
special
faa
authorization
but
provided
you
arent
doing
it
under
one
of
the
lax
runway
approaches
or
something
stupid
like
that
its
not
especially
hard
to
arrange
as
with
model
rocketry
this
sort
of
hardware
is
reasonably
safe
if
handled
properly
proper
handling
takes
more
care
and
you
need
a
lot
more
empty
air
to
fly
in
but
its
basically
just
model
rocketry
scaled
up
as
with
model
rocketry
the
highpower
people
use
factorybuilt
engines
which
eliminates
the
major
safety
hazard
of
doityourself
rocketry
all
work
is
