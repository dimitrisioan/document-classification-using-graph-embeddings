besides
this
was
the
same
line
of
horse
puckey
the
mining
companies
claimed
when
they
were
told
to
pay
for
restoring
land
after
strip
mining
they
still
mine
coal
in
the
midwest
but
now
it
doesnt
look
like
the
moon
when
theyare
done
pat
i
aint
talking
the
large
or
even
the
mining
companies
i
am
talking
the
small
miners
the
people
who
have
themselves
and
a
few
employees
if
at
allthe
people
who
go
out
every
year
and
set
up
thier
sluice
box
and
such
and
do
mining
the
semiold
fashion
way

modern
methods

point
i
am
talking
the
guy
who
coem
to
nome
evry
year

up
his
tent
on
the
beach
the
beach
was
washed
away
last
year
and
sets
up
hisher
sluice
box
and
goes
at
it
mining
i
know
the
large
corps
such
as
alaska
gold
company
might
complain
to
my
opinions
are
what
i
learn
at
the
local
bs
table
my
original
thingidea
was
that
the
way
to
get
space
mining
was
to
allow
the
ecofreaks
thier
way
as
they
have
done
with
other
mineral
development
you
cant
in
many
places
cant
go
to
the
bathroom
in
the
woods
without
some
form
of
regulation
covering
it
