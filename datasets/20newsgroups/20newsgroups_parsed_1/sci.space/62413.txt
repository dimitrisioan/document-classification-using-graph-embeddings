this

goes

the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
soon
companies
will
be
doing
larger
and
more
permanant
billboards
in
the
sky
i
wouldnt
want
a
world
a
few
decades
from
now
when
the
sky
looks
like
las
vegas
that
would
really
make
me
sad
think
for
a
moment
about
the
technology
required
to
do
that
by
the
time
they
could
make
the
earths
sky
look
like
las
vegas
the
people
could
afford
to
go
backpacking
on
the
moon
round
trip
costs
for
kg
to
the
moon
would
be
about
the
same
as
kg
in
a
low
earth
advertising
orbit
very
roughly
the
same
cost
as
a
smallish
billboard
therefore
if
such
ads
were
to
become
common
place
that
would
have
to
be
a
very
low
price
the
night
sky
on
a
lunar
backpacking
trip
would
still
be
very
pristine
theres
always
been
a
problem
of
having
to
get
away
from
civilization
before
you
can
really
find
natural
scenery
years
ago
this
usually
didnt
take
a
trip
of
over
miles
today
most
people
would
have
to
go
miles
or
more
if
we
ever
get
to
the
point
where
we
have
billboards
on
orbit
that
essentially
means
that
no
place
on
earth
is
still
wild
while
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
the
orbital
billboards
arent
the
problem
they
are
just
a
symptom
of
growing
denselypopulated
civilization
banning
such
ads
will
not
save
your
view
of
the
night
sky
because
by
the
time
such
ads
could
become
widespread
you
will
probably
have
trouble
finding
a
place
without
street
lights
where
you
can
see
the
stars
coca
cola
company
will
want
to
paint
the
moon
red
and
white
well
if
not
this
moon
then
a
moon
of
jupiter
an
ad
on
a
moon
of
jupiter
would
be
rather
pointless
since
you
need
a
telescope
to
see
them
however
id
love
to
see
them
get
all
the
publicity
they
could
from
underwritting
the
coca

io
orbital

microscum
will
want
to
name
a
galaxy
microscum
galaxy
they
already
can
to
some
extent
the
iau
allows
names
derived
from
sponsors
or
patrons
of
scientific
research
if
microscum
donates
money
to
a
university
astronomy
program
one
of
the
galactic
astronomers
could
easily
get
a
newly
discovered
galaxy
named
after
them
