this
leads
to
the
more
general
question
do
yet
other
people
than
the
us
russia
and
japan
do
space
surveillance
and
if
so
how
and
why

the
french
spot
is
an
example
that
comes
to
mind
although
the
company
name
escapes
me
at
the
moment
sells
images
worldwide
you
can
bet
your
last
dollar
franc
that
the
french
govt
gets
first
dibs
i
remember
a
few
years
ago
about
the
time
spot
was
launched
i
was
speaking
to
my
dad
an
usaf
officer
about
this
and
that
and
i
happend
to
mention
spot
i
think
we
were
talking
about
technology
utilization
he
just
about
went
ballistic
he
wanted
to
know
how
i
knew
about
spot
and
just
what
i
knew
i
guess
that
space
surveillance
is
such
a
sensitive
topic
in
the
air
force
that
he
couldnt
believe
that
i
would
read
about
such
a
system
in
the
popular
press
