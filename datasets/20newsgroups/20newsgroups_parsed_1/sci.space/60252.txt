subject
fred
and
tom
ad
naseum
nick
sez
im
not
very
impressed
by
the
old
socalled
prospecting
work
from
lpi
it
has
almost
all
been
geared
towards
industrially
silly
processes
on
the
moon
as
an
excuse
to
put
astronauts
there
fred
replies
translation
it
doesnt
support
the
nick
szabo
vision
of
the
future
to
which
you
must
subscribe
tom
sez
fred
were
all
supporting
what
each
of
us
thinks
should
be
done
to
some
degree
if
you
have
a
problem
with
what
nick
thinks
should
be
done
address
it
instead
of
just
complaining
about
his
doing
so
fred
again
you
really
dont
get
what
the
complaints
are
about
do
you
not
incredibly
clear
explanation
of
complaintssomething
between
feelings
regarding
nicks
method
and
judgments
about
his
meaning
t
maybe
id
get
it
if
you
said
what
the
complaints
are
about
rather
than
doing
the
same
things
that
you
mean
to
complain
about
when
you
trash
people
how
am
i
supposed
to
read
that
as
trashing
people
is
bad
f
gee
funny
that
you
get
it
now
then
deliberate
obtuseness
perhaps
freds
issue
nicks
alleged
trashing
of
others
i
only
got
it
when
you
stopped
trashing
and
made
your
point
patently
instead
of
allegorically
that
was
my
point
all
along
fred
not
only
do
you
do
the
same
thing
on
the
net
honestly
reporting
your
ideas
on
matters
of
policy
and
projects
in
space
but
your
response
was
just
baiting
not
even
part
of
a
debate
i
have
yet
to
see
nick
enter
into
anything
remotely
resembling
a
debate
i
see
him
flame
anyone
or
anything
who
disagrees
with
the
one
true
szabo
plan
i
see
him
attacking
people
calling
them
lazy
bastard
because
they
had
the
temerity
to
disagree
with
the
almight
nick
i
see
him
questioning
peoples
ethics
again
because
they
had
the
temerity
to
disagree
with
lord
god
szabo
but
debate
bwaaaaahhhaaaa
im
glad
you
can
laugh
since
your
ratio
of
debateinsult
is
about
the
same
not
even
close
tommy
and
generally
only
when
im
dealing
with
someone
like
nick
i
see
we
are
dealing
with
a
problem
in
a
conflict
of
interpretations
not
least
of
which
is
your
belief
that
only
you
can
adequately
judge
what
is
and
is
not
debate
suffice
to
say
that
i
disagree
with
you
on
that
last
point
why
dont
you
take
a
poll
fred
if
you
want
some
psuedoobjective
pointofview
and
as
usual
you
defend
your
insults
with
he
started
it
yeah
i
took
some
of
his
research
and
called
it
my
own
but
he
started
it
so
what
if
i
stole
his
car
he
stole
my
lawnmower
first
besides
that
i
think
its
still
open
to
interpretation
whether
nick
actually
did
start
it
so
your
defense
besides
being
lame
and
contradicting
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
in
which
it
occurs
may
not
even
apply
anyway
your
defense
reminds
me
of
the
guy
that
broke
the
borrowed
tool
i
never
borrowed
it
i
already
gave
it
back
and
it
was
broken
when
you
gave
it
to
me
make
up
yer
mind
fred
im
not
convinced
that
people
are
necessary
in
all
parts
of
every
space
based
process
and
your
response
doesnt
tell
me
a
thing
about
the
reasons
why
you
think
they
should
be
except
to
impune
the
motives
of
the
person
with
a
divergent
opinion
who
said
i
think
they
should
be
tommy
show
me
a
note
where
i
said
that
and
ill
eat
this
terminal
see
below
fred
fred
i
cocluded
that
you
did
since
you
took
issue
with
it
the
fact
that
my
conclusion
was
incorrect
ie
that
you
were
taking
issue
with
something
different
is
evidence
that
your
communication
style
is
confusing
or
evidence
that
your
reading
and
comprehension
style
are
inadequate
first
i
try
to
address
what
i
think
you
meant
for
which
i
am
rewarded
with
a
denial
of
sorts
and
a
smart
remark
then
i
point
out
that
i
am
not
clear
what
you
did
mean
rather
than
risking
your
childish
ire
wrongly
interpreting
you
a
second
time
and
im
stupid
for
it
i
just
cant
win
can
i
fred
youve
got
a
great
point
here
somewhere
its
just
that
between
stupid
people
that
you
must
insult
and
your
jealous
guarding
of
your
valuable
opinions
you
never
actually
get
around
to
making
it
please
quote
the
it
i
took
issue
with
i
believe
you
will
see
if
you
look
that
what
i
was
and
am
taking
issue
with
is
mr
szabos
idea
that
the
manned
program
should
be
scrapped
until
such
time
as
his
toasterbased
infrastructure
is
finished
all
hail
the
szabo
plan
fred
issue
nicks
alleged
meaning
too
bad
the
plan
only
exists
in
your
mind
instead
of
nicks
or
you
would
have
a
really
good
point
instead
you
have
provided
a
good
reason
to
ignore
your
insults
since
they
are
based
on
incorrect
interpretations
that
you
have
made
about
others
forgive
me
for
giving
your
insults
more
meaning
than
they
ever
should
have
had
my
reading
of
what
nick
actually
said
is
that
people
arent
required
in
all
parts
of
all
space
processes
so
your
taking
issue
with
his
opinions
regarding
people
in
the
space
program
i
read
as
people
are
required
in
all
parts
of
all
space
processes
so
help
me
out
here
fred
since
im
so
patently
stupid
did
you
read
nick
wrong
or
are
you
going
to
eat
your
terminal
now
if
the
latter
i
sure
hope
its
one
of
those
cheeto
and
string
models
that
all
the
computer
mags
have
been
raving
about
the
point
is
i
am
not
stupid
because
of
your
incorrect
assumption
id
only
be
stupid
if
i
insulted
you
for
having
made
it
but
alas
thats
your
job
fred
and
finally
your
style
is
confusing
since
you
tried
to
make
two
points
simultaneously
with
an
allegoryinsult
sadly
one
point
addressed
a
plan
that
only
existed
in
your
mind
and
the
other
took
issue
with
behaviors
that
you
do
as
much
as
anyone
more
deliberate
lack
of
understanding
tommy
no
no
i
finally
got
it
you
dont
like
the
plan
that
nicks
posts
made
you
imagine
and
you
dont
like
nicks
obnoxious
behavior
even
though
its
no
worse
than
your
own
thanks
for
taking
the
time
with
someone
as
dense
as
myself
if
you
have
a
problem
with
nicks
delivery
address
that
the
way
you
bait
youre
perpetuating
the
lack
of
discourse
that
you
complain
of
no
tommy
the
bait
is
that
which
elicits
the
response
nick
baits
i
just
flame
him
for
being
an
obnoxious
fool
i
dont
really
care
who
started
it
i
read
this
list
to
get
information
and
others
views
on
the
issues
to
which
it
was
dedicated
not
to
be
your
mom
he
started
it
no
he
did
or
to
hear
about
why
nick
is
a
very
bad
guy
if
you
think
flaming
is
bad
stop
flaming
or
at
least
get
to
the
point
in
the
first
post
instead
of
explaining
yourself
all
the
time
thats
nice
tommy
when
you
pay
me
to
post
to
the
net
you
can
complain
about
not
getting
your
moneys
worth
perhaps
if
you
werent
deliberately
too
thick
to
get
the
point
the
first
time
i
wouldnt
have
to
waste
time
explaining
myself
all
the
time
of
course
socrates
how
could
it
be
otherwise
i
think
its
neat
how
all
this
criticism
from
you
started
after
your
fatherly
admonitions
to
me
about
how
such
things
should
be
handled
outside
usenet
were
somewhat
rebuffed
being
a
little
hypocritical
tommy
to
go
with
the
immaturity
or
is
this
just
the
pique
of
a
netghod
wannabe
who
got
turned
down
by
someone
he
thought
was
new
and
hence
could
be
instructed
tommy
i
saw
you
come
on
the
net
who
cares
who
came
on
the
net
first
if
you
do
consider
that
you
saw
me
come
on
after
a
brief
haitus
before
which
i
was
on
for
about
years
if
you
had
seen
me
on
the
net
first
youd
remember
when
nick
and
i
went
down
exactly
the
same
road
regarding
rude
unneccesary
behavior
its
just
amazing
to
me
that
you
continue
to
take
issue
with
behavior
thats
no
worse
than
your
own
lets
see
here
my
complaints
about
your
obnoxious
behavior
are
hypocritical
while
your
flames
against
people
you
decide
are
flamers
isnt
and
my
complaints
about
your
namecalling
are
immature
while
your
namecalling
isnt
yeah
right
maybe
if
you
called
me
some
more
names
i
might
see
it
better
fred
netghod
wannabe
naturally
fred
youve
correctly
interpreted
my
motivations
when
yours
are
impossible
to
judge
from
your
actions
as
your
insulting
of
people
that
try
proves
i
didnt
really
care
about
people
that
fill
the
net
with
personal
garbage
what
i
really
wanted
was
to
impress
everyone
i
only
put
my
complaints
with
your
behavior
on
private
mail
not
because
it
belongs
there
but
because
i
thought
you
were
such
a
jerk
that
youd
bring
it
back
to
the
net
playing
right
into
my
hands
alas
i
had
no
idea
what
an
intellectual
master
you
were
turning
tables
and
bringing
the
history
of
these
posts
to
the
net
for
the
noble
and
valuable
purpose
of
embarassing
me
whether
i
should
feel
stupid
because
i
tried
to
make
suggestions
to
such
a
superior
intellect
or
becuase
i
tried
to
communicate
like
an
adult
with
a
selfrighteous
ass
still
isnt
clear
well
fred
you
exposed
me
now
ill
never
be
able
to
get
another
job
with
nasa
since
they
all
know
that
im
stupider
than
fred
mccall
well
i
just
hope
youre
happy
please
leave
me
alone
now
i
just
dont
have
the
heart
to
attempt
keeping
up
with
one
so
far
above
me
maybe
nick
or
pat
can
approach
your
high
standards
but
im
dropping
it
now
tommy
