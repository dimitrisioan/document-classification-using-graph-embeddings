now
that
hermes

boron
are
effectively
cancelled
these
officials
should
spend
more
of
their
time
explaining
to
their
european
and
asian
partners
how
we
are
expected
to
believe
in
them
when
their
paymasters
change
their
minds
on
major
international
projects
everytime
a
new
us
administration
takes
office
considering
the
major
impacts
this
has
on
the
european
and
asian
japanese
industry
it
is
also
appreciated
