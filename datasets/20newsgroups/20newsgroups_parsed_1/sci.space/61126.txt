since
we
dont
have
the
money
to
keep
them
going
now
how
will
changing
them
to
a
seperate
agency
help
anything
how
about
transferring
control
to
a
nonprofit
organisation
that
is
able
to
accept
donations
to
keep
craft
operational
the
problem
is
you
cant
raise
adequate
amounts
of
money
that
way
the
viking
fund
tried
they
did
succeed
in
a
way
but
only
because
of
the
political
impact
of
their
fundraising
the
actual
amount
of
money
they
raised
was
fairly
inconsequential
it
would
not
have
kept
the
viking
lander
going
by
itself
all
work
is
one
