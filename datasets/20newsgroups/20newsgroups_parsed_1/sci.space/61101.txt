big
amateur
rockets
paul

writes
i
was
reading
popular
science
this
morning
and
was
surprised
by
an
ad
in
the
back
i
know
that
a
lot
of
the
ads
in
the
back
of
ps
are
fringe
science
or
questionablely
legal
but
this
one
really
grabbed
my
attention
it
was
from
a
company
name
personal
missle
inc
or
something
like
that
the
company
was
probably
public
missiles
inc
of
michigan
anyhow
the
ad
stated
that
theyd
sell
rockets
that
were
up
to
in
length
and
engines
of
sizes
f
to
m
they
also
said
that
some
rockets
will
reach
feet
yup
now
aside
from
the
obvious
dangers
to
any
amateur
rocketeer
using
one
of
these
beasts
isnt
this
illegal
i
cant
imagine
the
faa
allowing
people
to
shoot
rockets
up
through
the
flight
levels
of
passenger
planes
not
to
even
mention
the
problem
of
locating
a
rocket
when
it
comes
down
nope
its
not
illegal
it
is
however
closely
regulated
in
order
to
purchase
and
use
the
big
rocket
motors
required
it
is
necessary
to
be
one
of
the
following
a
an
employee
of
a
government
agency
b
an
employee
or
student
at
a
university
doing
research
involving
rockets
c
a
member
or
representative
of
an
educational
organization
involved
in
research
or
other
uses
of
rockets
there
are
two
such
organizations
the
tripoli
rocketry
association
and
the
national
association
of
rocketry
members
of
either
organization
must
demonstrate
proficiency
in
construction
and
flight
before
they
are
allowed
to
purchase
large
motors
on
their
own
the
faa
will
issue
a
waiver
of
its
regulations
upon
request
to
any
organization
which
can
persuade
them
it
has
taken
adequate
precautions
to
avoid
conflicts
with
aircraft
the
usual
stipulations
are
only
operation
up
to
a
specified
ceiling
is
allowed
depending
on
the
location
this
ceiling
may
be
from
to
feet
agl
the
operator
of
the
rocket
is
responsible
for
avoiding
any
aircraft
within
the
operating
radius
around
the
launch
site
flight
into
clouds
or
beyond
visual
range
in
haze
is
expressly
prohibited
the
faa
will
provide
a
notam
informing
other
users
of
the
airspace
that
unmanned
rocket
operations
are
taking
place
at
the
specified
place
and
time
most
of
the
launches
that
are
held
and
there
are
dozens
of
them
every
year
are
held
in
areas
where
air
traffic
is
relatively
light
such
as
over
the
western
deserts
the
black
rock
desert
north
of
reno
is
particularly
popular
since
it
is
x
miles
of
nothing
to
hit
on
the
ground
the
two
rocketry
associations
test
and
approve
motors
for
their
members
use
to
insure
safety
depending
on
motor
size
the
launcher
setback
is
from
to
or
more
feet
by
the
way
rockets
under
lb
and
powered
by
an
f
motor
are
exempt
from
most
federal
regulations
on
unmanned
rockets
anyway
see
far
subpart
c
for
details
as
for
recoveryalthough
the
higher
altitude
rockets
can
reach
up
to
feet
most
of
them
only
get
to
to
feet
the
typical
rocket
is
to
inches
in
diameter
and
carries
a
to
foot
parachute
or
multiple
parachutes
depending
on
the
payload
many
rockets
also
carry
either
a
small
transmitter
or
an
audio
sounderparticularly
at
launches
in
the
eastern
us
where
there
are
more
obstructions
camera
telemetry
transmitter
and
video
payloads
are
becoming
quite
common
and
no
im
not
going
to
even
think
of
buying
one
im
not
that
crazy
why
not
its
a
lot
of
funcheck
out
the
traffic
on
recmodelsrockets
for
information
about
the
model
lb
and
under
and
high
power
everything
bigger
rocket
hobbies
as
with
all
dangerous
activities
the
key
is
to
practice
safety
ive
been
flying
consumer
rockets
ranging
up
to
lbs
takeoff
weight
for
years
and
still
have
all
my
extremities
intact
paul
minell
do
feet
and
carries
pounds
of
dynamite
dokas
thats
another
thing
no
explosive
warheads
of
any
kind
are
allowed
on
these
rockets
none
please
forgive
me
for
shouting
but
thats
one
of
the
biggest
misconceptions
people
have
about
our
hobby
just
remember
you
will
die
someday
true
but
it
will
not
be
related
to
the
rocket
hobby
unless
i
get
hit
while
crossing
a
road
with
a
rocket
in
my
hand
