i
know

lets
hear
it
for
dan
goldinnow
if
he
can
only
convince
the
rest
of
our
federal
government
that
the
space
program
is
a
worth
while
investment
i
hope
that
i
will
live
to
see
the
day
we
walk
on
mars
but
we
need
to
address
the
technical
hurdles
first
if
theres
sufficient
interest
maybe
we
should
consider
starting
a
scispace
group
devoted
to
the
technical
analysis
of
longduration
human
spaceflight
most
of
you
regulars
know
that
im
interested
in
starting
this
analysis
as
soon
as
possible
