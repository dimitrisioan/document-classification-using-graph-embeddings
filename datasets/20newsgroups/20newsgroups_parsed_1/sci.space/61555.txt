why
do
you
need
to
boost
the
orbit
on
this
mission
anyway
you
dont
need
to
but
its
desirable
hst
like
all
satellites
in
low
earth
orbit
is
gradually
losing
altitude
due
to
air
drag
it
was
deployed
in
the
highest
orbit
the
shuttle
could
reach
for
that
reason
it
needs
occasional
reboosting
or
it
will
eventually
reenter
it
has
no
propulsion
system
of
its
own
has
any
thought
been
given
as
to
how
they
are
going
to
boost
the
hst
yet
give
it
a
push
i
can
see
the
push
start
cartoons
now

reply
to
for

all
this
might
be
an
elaborate
simulation
running
in
a
little
