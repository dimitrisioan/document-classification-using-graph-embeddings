the
nasa
habit
of
acquiring
secondhand
military
aircraft
and
using
them
for
testbeds
can
make
things
kind
of
confusing
on
the
other

all
those
secondhand
navy
planes
give
our
test
pilots
a
chance
to
fold

what
do
you

overstress
the
wings
and
they

navy
aircraft
have
folding
or
sweeping
wings
in
order
to
save
space
on
the

the

planes
dont
