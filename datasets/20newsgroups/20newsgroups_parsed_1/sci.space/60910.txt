why
not
give

residents

wrote
announce
that
a
reward
of
billion
would
go
to
the
first
corporation
who
successfully
keeps
at
least
person
alive
on
the
moon
for
a
year
then
youd
see
some
of
the
inexpensive
but
not
popular
technologies
begin
to
be
developed
thered
be
a
different
kind
of
space
race
then
im
an
advocate
of
this
idea
for
funding
space
station
work
and
i
throw
around
the
billion
figure
for
that
reward
i
suggest
that
you
increase
the
lunar
reward
to
about
billion
this
would
encourage
private
industry
to
invest
in
space
which
should
be
one
of
nasas
primary
goals

also
would
maybe
get
the
russians
involved
after
all
they
do
have
the
resources
to
do
it
in
part
but
they
need
the
capital
and
the
goal
i
wonder
if
renting
the
russians
resources
would
be
a
disqualification
