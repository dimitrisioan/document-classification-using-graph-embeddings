does
anyone
know
how
to
size
cold
gas
roll
control
thruster
tanks
for
sounding
rockets
well
first
you
work
out
how
much
cold
gas
you
need
then
make
the
tanks
big
enough
our
sounding
rocket
payload
with
telemetry
guidance
etc
etc
and
a
telescope
cluster
weighs
around
pounds
it
uses
freon
jets
for
steering
and
a
pulsewidthmodulated
controller
for
alignment
ie
during
our
eight
minutes
in
space
the
jets
are
pretty
much
continuously
firing
on
a
duty
cycle
or
so
the
jets
also
need
to
kill
residual
angular
momentum
from
the
spin
stabilization
and
flip
the
payload
around
to
look
at
the
sun
we
have
two
freon
tanks
each
holding
liters
of
freon
im
speaking
only
from
memory
of
the
last
flight
the
ground
crew
at
wsmr
choose
how
much
freon
to
use
based
on
some
blackmagic
algorithm
they
have
extra
tank
modules
that
just
bolt
into
the
payload
stack
this
should
give
you
an
idea
of
the
order
of
magnitude
for
cold
gas
quantity
if
you
really
need
to
know
send
me
email
and
ill
try
to
get
you
in
touch
with
our
ground
crew
people
cheers
craig
dont
drink
soap
dilute
dilute
ok
