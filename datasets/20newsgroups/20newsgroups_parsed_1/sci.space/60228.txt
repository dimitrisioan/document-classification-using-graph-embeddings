ok
so
how
about
the
creation
of
oil
producing
bacteria
i
figure
that
if
you
can
make
them
to
eat
it
up
then
you
can
make
them
to
shit
it
any
comments
sure
why
keep
using
oil
a
hydrogenelectric
economy
would
likely
be
cleaner
and
more
efficient
in
the
long
run
the
laws
of
supply
and
demand
should
get
the
transition
underway
before
we
reach
a
critical
stage
of
shortage
