be
the
site
of
major
commercial
activity
as
far
as
we
know
it
has
no
materials
we
cant
get
cheaper
right
here
on
earth
or
from
asteroids
and
comets
aside
from
the
semimythic
he
that
might
be
useful
in
low
grade
fusion
reactors
i
dont
know
what
a
low
grade
fusion
reactor
is
but
the
major
problem
with
he
aside
from
the
difficulty
in
making
any
fusion
reactor
work
is
that
its
concentration
in
lunar
regolith
is
just
so
small
on
the
order
of
ppb
or
so
on
average
more
in
some
fractions
but
still
very
small
massive
amounts
of
regolith
would
have
to
be
processed
this
thread
reminds
me
of
wingos
claims
some
time
ago
about
the
moon
as
a
source
of
titanium
for
use
on
earth
as
i
recall
wingo
wasnt
content
with
being
assured
that
titanium
at
in
the
earths
crust
average
would
not
run
out
and
touted
lunar
mines
even
though
the
market
price
of
ilmenite
concentrate
these
days
is
around
pound
this
prompted
me
to
look
up
large
potential
terrestrial
sources
on
the
moon
titanium
occurs
in
basalts
highti
basalts
apollo
and
have
titanium
dioxide
by
weight
this
is
nice
but
terrestrial
continental
flood
basalts
are
also
typically
enriched
in
titanium
they
very
often
have
tio
frequently
have
and
sometimes
even
tio
again
by
weight
these
flood
basalts
are
enormous
millions
of
cubic
kilometers
scattered
all
over
the
world
siberia
brazil
the
nw
united
states
ethiopia
etc
if
even
of
the
basalts
are
tio
this
is
trillions
of
tons
of
tio
at
concentrations
only
a
factor
of
less
than
in
lunar
highti
basalts
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
disadvantages
of
the
moon
could
be
overcome
by
such
a
small
increase
the
concentration
of
the
ore
never
mind
the
richer
but
less
common
terrestrial
ores
being
mined
today
