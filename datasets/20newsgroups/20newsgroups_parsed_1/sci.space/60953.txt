moonbase
race
from
gene
wright
with
the
continuin
talk
about
the
end
of
the
space
age
and
complaints
by
government
over
the
large
cost
why
not
try
something
i
read
about
that
might
just
work
announce
that
a
reward
of
billion
would
go
to
the
first
corporation
who
successfully
keeps
at
least
person
alive
on
the
moon
for
a
year
then
youd
see
some
of
the
inexpensive
but
not
popular
technologies
begin
to
be
developed
thered
be
a
different
kind
of
space
race
then
ill
say
imagine
that
there
were
a
couple
groups
up
there
maybe
landing
a
few
weeks
apart
the
yearmark
starts
coming
on
for
the
first
group
isnt
a
billion
pretty
good
incentive
to
take
a
shot
at
a
potential
winner
yeah
thats
a
shame
that
team
as
life
support
gave
out
so
close
to
the
deadline
thanks
for
the
billion
on
the
other
hand
if
apollo
cost
billion
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
in
space
in
dollars
then
wont
the
reward
have
to
be
a
lot
more
than
only
billion
to
get
any
takers
