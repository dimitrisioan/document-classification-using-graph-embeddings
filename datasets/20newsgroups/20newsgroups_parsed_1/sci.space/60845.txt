i
know
someone
had
long
talks
about
solar
sails
early
this
year
and
late
last
yearalso
about
solar
sailing
not
sure
who
captured
it
if
possible
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
regulars
who
had
most
or
all
the
data
i
think
i
started
the
latest
round
or
the
late
last
year
round
but
the
topic
has
been
around
here
off
and
on
for
a
year
or
two
