has
anyone
looked
into
the
possiblity
of
a
protoncentaur
combo
i
dont
know
a
whole
lot
on
proton
but
given
that
it
is
a
multi
stage
rocket
up
to
stages
it
may
not
really
need
the
centaur
plus
it
may
end
up
seriously
beating
on
said
centaur
also
the
centaur
is
not
small
unless
the
proton
has
an
oversize
shroud
you
may
not
be
able
to
get
the
centaur
in
under
it
dennis
you
know
much
about
this
pat
