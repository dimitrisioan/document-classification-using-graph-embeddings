mission
scispace
readers
can
skip
the
first
paragraph
yesterday
in
response
to
henry
spencers
question
about
the
temperature
of
a
blackbody
in
interstellar
space
i
said
dust
grains
acts
as
blackbodies
and
theyre
at
k
well
i
was
dead
wrong
our
local
interstellar
dust
expert
bruce
draine
has
informed
me
that
dust
grains
arent
good
radiators
in
the
far
ir
which
is
why
they
are
so
warm
actually
the
ambient
radiation
field
from
distant
stars
can
bring
a
true
blackbody
to
only
or
kelvin
sorry
henry
and
anyone
else
i
misled
obviously
time
for
me
to
take
another
ism
class
in
other
news
alan
stern
of
the
southwest
research
institute
gave
a
talk
on
the
plutocharon
binary
system
yesterday
he
gave
a
brief
overview
of
the
currentlyaccepted
system
parameters
volume
ratio
of
about
mass
ratio
about
or
so
plus
lots
more
and
then
gave
his
thoughts
on
the
formation
of
plutocharon
his
idea
is
that
there
were
lots
and
lots
of
small
planetesimals
in
the
outer
solar
system
with
masses
distributed
as
a
power
law
of
some
kind
over
time
the
planetesimals
accreted
into
larger
bodies
most
got
scattered
out
of
the
solar
system
by
close
encounters
with
jupiter
and
saturn
but
many
accreted
into
the
gas
giants
especially
uranus
and
neptune
a
large
planetesimal
was
captured
by
neptune
we
call
it
triton
captured
how
perhaps
by
a
collision
with
a
smaller
alreadyexisting
neptunian
moon
perhaps
by
a
very
close
passage
through
neptunes
atmosphere
mondo
aerobraking
he
notes
that
the
two
recently
discovered
kuiper
belt
objects
qb
and
fw
plus
chiron
and
pholus
are
all
about
the
same
mass
and
he
identifies
this
group
as
oneaccretiondown
from
the
larger
bodies
of
triton
and
plutocharon
plutocharon
he
thinks
formed
when
an
impacting
body
hit
protopluto
knocking
some
material
into
a
ring
around
pluto
which
later
accreted
in
charon
similar
to
ideas
about
the
formation
of
earths
moon
there
is
good
evidence
from
spectra
that
the
surfaces
of
pluto
and
charon
are
very
different
pluto
has
methane
frost
charon
doesnt
which
can
be
used
as
evidence
for
the
impact
theory
he
believes
that
there
may
be
around
plutotochironsized
objects
remaining
in
a
relatively
stable
dynamical
zone
just
outside
neptunes
orbit
beyond
au
or
so
qb
and
fw
are
the
first
members
of
this
population
to
be
found
in
his
model
note
that
such
bodies
will
be
very
dark
since
if
their
surfaces
are
covered
with
methane
frost
it
will
have
photolyzed
into
very
dark
longchain
hydrocarbons
by
now
the
reason
that
pluto
has
such
a
high
albedo
around
i
think
is
that
its
surface
warms
up
just
enough
around
perihelion
to
sublimate
and
when
the
atmosphere
freezes
out
again
thirty
years
later
it
forms
bright
new
frost
so
any
bodies
much
farther
away
than
au
are
going
to
be
very
hard
to
see
i
hope
i
havent
made
any
errors
in
the
transcription
if
you
see
a
howling
mistake
its
undoubtedly
mine
not
his
by
the
way
hes
one
of
the
top
guns
behind
the
pluto
fast
flyby
mission
i
think
and
said
that
the
current
plans
are
to
use
a
titan
to
send
the
probe
on
just
about
a
rectilinear
trajectory
to
pluto
we
were
speaking
loosely
at
the
time
hed
like
to
use
a
proton
which
gives
a
slightly
smaller
velocity
but
costs
much
less
his
figures
million
for
titan
launches
there
will
be
two
separate
probes
launched
separately
or
million
for
proton
launches
he
told
a
story
about
how
the
soviets
originally
offered
to
sell
proton
launches
for
million
each
but
were
forced
to
increase
their
prices
in
the
us
in
order
to
be
allowed
in
the
marketplace
im
just
telling
you
what
he
said
michael
michael
richmond
this
is
the
heart
that
broke
my
finger
