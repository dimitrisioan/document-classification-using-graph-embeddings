there
is
an
emergency
oxygen
system
that
is
capable
of
maintaining
a
breathable
atmosphere
in
the
cabin
for
long
enough
to
come
down
even
if
there
is
something
like
a
cm
hole
in
the
wall
that
nobody
tries
to
plug

wow
double
wow
can
you
land
a
shuttle
with
a
cm
hole
in
the
wall
personnally
i
dont
know
but
id
like
to
try
it
sometime
programmatically
yes
we
can
land
an
orbiter
with
a
cm
hole
in
the
wall
provided
that
the
thing
which
caused
cm
hole
didnt
cause
a
crit
failure
on
some
of
the
internal
systems
there
are
a
few
places
where
a
cm
hole
would
cause
a
bad
day
especially
if
the
cm
hole
went
all
the
way
through
the
orbiter
and
out
the
other
side
as
could
easily
happen
with
a
meteor
strike
but
a
hole
in
the
pressure
vessel
would
cause
us
to
immediately
deorbit
to
the
next
available
landing
