subject
sarsat
for
tracking
payload
deployed
by
tether
we
are
interested
in
constructing
a
reentry
vehicle
to
be
deployed
from
a
tether
attached
to
an
orbiting
platform
this
will
be
a
follow
on
to
our
succesful
deployment
of
a
kilometer
tether
on
the
march
flight
of
seds
small
expendable
deployment
system
which
released
an
instrumented
payload
that
reentered
the
earths
atmosphere
and
burned
up
over
the
west
coast
of
mexico
this
time
we
want
to
make
a
payload
that
can
be
recovered
we
want
to
build
it
from
off
the
shelf
technology
so
as
to
do
this
as
quickly
and
inexpensively
as
possible
we
want
to
be
able
to
track
the
payload
after
it
has
deployed
its
parachute
an
idea
we
have
is
to
put
the
same
kind
of
radio
beacon
on
it
that
is
used
with
sarsats
search
and
rescue
satellites
it
would
turn
on
with
the
opening
of
the
parachute
and
aid
in
tracking
these
beacons
are
known
in
the
marine
industry
as
epirbs
emergency
position
indicating
radio
beacon
they
are
rugged
they
have
to
be
to
survive
a
ship
wreck
and
cheap
we
have
several
questions
what
is
the
world
authority
regulating
the
use
of
sarsat
beacons
are
there
multiple
authorites
ie
military
and
civilian
what
are
the
regulations
regarding
the
use
of
sarsat
signals
can
they
be
used
for
one
of
a
kind
situations
with
a
long
lead
time
of
warning
the
relevant
authorities
or
are
they
strictly
reserved
for
life
threatening
emergencies
what
is
the
coverage
of
sarsats
are
they
in
leo
with
only
intermittant
coverage
of
a
fixed
position
on
the
earth
or
are
they
in
geosynchronous
orbit
is
there
an
industry
organization
governing
the
use
and
manufacture
of
these
transponders

you
very
much

any
assistance
