a

enough
to
type

this
text
is
a
history
of
the
spaceship
as
both
a
cultural
and
a
technological
phenomenon
the
idea
of
a
vehicle
for
traversing
the
space
betwen
worlds
did
not
spring
fullblown
into
existence
in
the
tlatter
half
of
theis
century
the
need
preceded
the
ability
ot
make
such
a
device
by
several
hundred
years
as
soon
as
it
was
realized
that
there
were
other
worlds
than
this
one
human
beings
wanted
to
reach
them
tracing
the
history
of
the
many
imaginative
and
often
prescient
attempts
to
solve
this
problem
also
reflects
the
history
of
technology
science
astronomy
and
engineering
once
space
travel
became
feasible
there
were
many
more
spacecraft
concepts
developed
than
ever
got
off
the
drawing
board
or
off
the
ground
for
that
matter
these
also
are
described
in
theis
book
for
the
same
reason
as
the
prespaceage
and
preflight
ideas
are
they
are
all
accurate
reflections
of
their
particular
eras
dreams
abilities
and
knowledge
virtually
every
spaceship
concept
invented
since
as
well
as
selected
events
important
in
developing
the
idea
of
extraterrestrial
travel
is
listed
chronologically
the
chronological
entries
allow
comparisons
between
actual
astronautical
events
and
speculative
ventures
they
also
allow
comparisons
between
simultaneous
events
taking
place
in
different
countries
they
reveal
connections
influences
and
evolutions
hitherto
unsuspected
every
entry
is
accompanied
by
at
least
one
illustration
nearly
every
spacecraft
concept
is
illustrated
with
a
schematic
drawing
this
allows
accurate
comparisons
to
be
made
between
designss
to
visualize
differences
similarities
and
influences
this
text
will
be
of
interest
to
students
of
astronautical
history

model
builders
