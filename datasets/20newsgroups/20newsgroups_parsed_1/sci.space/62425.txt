it
is
however
now
somewhat
of
an
experimental
science
with
the
exploration
of
fractals
strange
attractors
and
artificial
life
whether
important
insights
will
be
gained
from
these
experiments
is
unknown
but
it
does
tend
to
change
the
shape
of
what
has
mostly
been
viewed
as
an
abstract
deductive
field
how
do
you
do
experiments
in
mathematics
nowadays
usually

no

the

listed

no
one
can
yet
write
an
algorithm
that
will
predict
the
precise
behavior
of
any
of
these
at
any
precise
level
of
their

so
it
remains
for
experimenters
to
gather
data
on
their
behavior
