april
scientists
at
nasas
jet
propulsion
laboratory
report
the
successful
flight
of
a
balloon
carrying
instruments
designed
to
measure
and
study
chemicals
in
the
earths
ozone
layer
the
april
flight
from
californias
barstowdaggett
airport
reached
an
altitude
of
kilometers
feet
and
took
measurements
as
part
of
a
program
established
to
correlate
data
with
the
upper
atmosphere
research
satellite
uars
the
data
from
the
balloon
flight
will
also
be
compared
to
readings
from
the
atmospheric
trace
molecular
spectroscopy
atmos
experiment
which
is
currently
flying
onboard
the
shuttle
discovery
we
launch
these
balloons
several
times
a
year
as
part
of
an
ongoing
ozone
research
program
in
fact
jpl
is
actively
involved
in
the
study
of
ozone
and
the
atmosphere
in
three
important
ways
said
dr
jim
margitan
principal
investigator
on
the
balloon
research
campaign
there
are
two
jpl
instruments
on
the
uars
satellite
he
continued
the
atmos
experiment
is
conducted
by
jpl
scientists
and
the
jpl
balloon
research
provides
collaborative
ground
truth
for
those
activities
as
well
as
data
that
is
useful
in
its
own
right
the
measurements
taken
by
the
balloon
payload
will
add
more
pieces
to
the
complex
puzzle
of
the
atmosphere
specifically
the
midlatitude
stratosphere
during
winter
and
spring
understanding
the
chemistry
occurring
in
this
region
helps
scientists
construct
more
accurate
computer
models
which
are
instrumental
in
predicting
future
ozone
conditions
the
scientific
balloon
payload
consisted
of
three
jpl
instruments
an
ultraviolet
ozone
photometer
which
measures
ozone
as
the
balloon
ascends
and
descends
through
the
atmosphere
a
submillimeterwave
limb
sounder
which
looks
at
microwave
radiation
emitted
by
molecules
in
the
atmosphere
and
a
fourier
transform
infrared
interferometer
which
monitors
how
the
atmosphere
absorbs
sunlight
launch
occurred
at
about
noontime
and
following
a
three
hour
ascent
the
balloon
floated
eastward
at
approximately
kilometers
per
hour
knots
data
was
radioed
to
ground
stations
and
recorded
onboard
the
flight
ended
at
pm
pacific
time
in
eastern
new
mexico
when
the
payload
was
commanded
to
separate
from
the
balloon
we
needed
to
fly
through
sunset
to
make
the
infrared
measurements
margitan
explained
and
we
also
needed
to
fly
in
darkness
to
watch
how
quickly
some
of
the
molecules
disappear
it
will
be
several
weeks
before
scientists
will
have
the
completed
results
of
their
experiments
they
will
then
forward
their
data
to
the
uars
central
data
facility
at
the
goddard
space
flight
center
in
greenbelt
maryland
for
use
by
the
uars
scientists
the
balloon
was
launched
by
the
national
scientific
balloon
facility
normally
based
in
palestine
tex
operating
under
a
contract
from
nasas
wallops
flight
facility
the
balloon
was
launched
in
california
because
of
the
westtoeast
wind
direction
and
the
desire
to
keep
the
operation
in
the
southwest
the
balloons
are
made
of
micron
mil
or
less
than
onethousandth
of
an
inch
thick
plastic
and
are
cubic
meters
million
cubic
feet
in
volume
when
fully
inflated
with
helium
meters
feet
in
diameter
the
balloons
weigh
between
and
kilograms
and
pounds
the
scientific
payload
weighs
about
kilograms
pounds
and
is
meters
six
feet
square
by
meters
feet
high
the
jpl

research
is
