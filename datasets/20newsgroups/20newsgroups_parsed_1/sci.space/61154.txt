plutos
atmosphere
will
start
to
freeze
out
around
and
after
about
increasing
areas
of
both
pluto
and
charon
will
be
in
permanent
shadow
that
will
make
imaging
and
geochemical
mapping
impossible
its
my
understanding
that
the
freezing
will
start
to
occur
because
of
the
growing
distance
of
pluto
and
charon
from
the
sun
due
to
its
elliptical
orbit
it
is
not
due
to
shadowing
effects
where
does
the
shadow
come
from
theres
nothing
close
enough
to
block
sunlight
from
hitting
them
i
wouldnt
expect
there
to
be
anything
block
our
view
of
them
either
what
am
i
missing
pluto
can
shadow
charon
and
viceversa
