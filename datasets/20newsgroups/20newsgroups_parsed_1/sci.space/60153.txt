the

nasa
guys
developed
the
rule

noone
knew
if
it
worked
until
boeing
built
the
hardware
and
maybe
the
fb
nope
the
decisive
triumph
of
the
area
rule
was
when
convairs

contractually
commmitted
to
being

actually
found

this
was
well
before
either
the

good
thing
i
stuck
in
a
couple
of
question
marks
up
there
i
seem
to
recall
somebody
built
or
at
least
proposed
a
wasp
waisetd
passenger
civil
transport
i
thought
it
was
a
but
maybe
it
was
a
dc
sure
it
had
a
funny
passenger
compartment
but
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
to
save
fuel
i
thought
area
rules
applied
even
before
transonic
speeds
just
not
as
badly
