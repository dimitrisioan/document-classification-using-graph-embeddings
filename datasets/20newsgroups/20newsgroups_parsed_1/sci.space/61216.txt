a
tense
standoff
entered
its
third
week
today
as
authorities
reported
no
progress
in
negotiations
with
charismatic
cult
leader
steve
jobs
negotiators
are
uncertain
of
the
situation
inside
the
compound
but
some
reports
suggest
that
half
of
the
hundreds
of
followers
inside
have
been
terminated
others
claim
to
be
staying
of
their
own
free
will
but
jobs
persuasive
manner
makes
this
hard
to
confirm
in
conversations
with
authorities
jobs
has
given
conflicting
information
on
how
heavily
prepared
the
group
is
for
war
with
the
industry
at
times
he
has
claimed
to
have
hardware
which
will
blow
anything
else
away
while
more
recently
he
claims
they
have
stopped
manufacturing
their
own
agents
from
the
atf
appletaligent
forces
believe
that
the
group
is
equipped
with
serious
hardware
including
caliber
pieces
and
possibly
canon
equipment
the
siege
has
attracted
a
variety
of
spectators
from
the
curious
to
other
cultists
some
have
offered
to
intercede
in
negotiations
including
a
young
man
who
will
identify
himself
only
as
bill
and
claims
to
be
the
msiah
former
members
of
the
cult
some
only
recently
deprogrammed
speak
hesitantly
of
their
former
lives
including
being
forced
to
work
hour
days
and
subsisting
on
jolt
and
twinkies
there
were
frequent
lectures
in
which
they
were
indoctrinated
into
a
theory
of
interpersonal
computing
which
rejects
traditional
roles
latenight
vigils
on
chesapeake
drive
are
taking
their
toll
on
federal
marshals
loud
rock
and
roll
mostly
talking
heads
blares
throughout
the
night
some
fear
that
jobs
will
fulfill
his
own
apocalyptic
prophecies
a
worry
reinforced
when
the
loudspeakers
carry
jobs
own
speeches
typically
beginning
with
a
chilling
i
want
to
welcome
you
to
the
