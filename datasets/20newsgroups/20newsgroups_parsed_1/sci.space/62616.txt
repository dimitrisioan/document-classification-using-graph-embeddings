sez
this
object
would
not
interfere
with
anyones
enjoyment
of
the
night
sky
it
would
be
invisible
at
night
nor
would
it
have
any
significant
impact
on
astronomical
observations
i
suspect
there
must
be
some
kind
of
underlying
agenda
coming
to
the
surface
when
in
spite
of
this
people
are
so
quick
to
shrilly
denounce
and
condemn
something
that
would
so
vividly
demonstrate
the
strength
of
western
capitalism
lazlo
nibble
sez
buying
lichtenstein
and
paving
it
over
with
ground
glass
would
also
demonstrate
the
strength
of
western
capitalism
but
that
doesnt
make
it
a
particularly
attractive
idea
is
that
what
this
country
has
been
reduced
to
the
planetary
equivalent
of
a
guy
who
gets
his
penis
out
at
parties
actually
paving
ground
glass
over
lichtenstein
wouldnt
demonstrate
the
strength
of
western
capitalism
since
its
strength
depends
on
use
of
the
mind
and
materials
in
the
fulfillment
of
needs
and
desires
mind
you
im
not
saying
noone
would
benefit
from
glassedover
land
but
i
dont
think
anyone
would
actually
pay
for
it
unlike
the
potential
billsats
i
dont
quite
follow
you
on
the
part
about
someone
exposing
their
genitals
at
parties
but
i
got
a
chuckle
from
it
anyway
and
i
thought
i
had
some
strange
friends
tommy
mac
tom
mcwilliams
wk
they
communicated
with
the
communists
hm
and
pacified
the
pacifists
