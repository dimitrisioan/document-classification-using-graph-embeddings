are
you
sure
g
is
the
right
number
as
far
as
i
know
pilots
are
blackout
in
dives
that
exceed
g
g
g
seems
to
be
out
of
human
tolerance
would
anybody
clarify
this
please
lan
apart
from
the
fact
that
you
get
g
in
the
pullout
not
the
dive
that
figure
is
about
right
for
sustained
g
no
protection
the
duration
of
g
its
rate
of
onset
body
position
and
support
aids
are
all
critical
parts
of
the
equation
i
remember
one
note
about
instrumented
gridiron
players
recording
peaks
about
g
stapp
the
aviation
doctor
either
by
accident
or
design
took
a
shortperiod
g
in
a
rocketsled
decelleration
eyeballsout
against
a
standard
s
harness
it
had
to
be
short
calculate
the
stopping
time
even
from
mph
at
that
g
a
bangseat
can
get
up
to
about
g
and
youd
better
be
sitting
straight
find
the
book
by
martinbakers
human
guinea
pig
to
hear
how
bad
it
can
get
if
the
rate
of
onset
is
too
high
a
reclining
position
and
a
good
gsuit
can
keep
a
pilot
functioning
at
around
g
a
flotation
tank
should
be
a
good
bet
since
you
can
treat
the
body
as
a
fluid
and
highpressure
situations
are
not
new
anyone
have
any
figures
ray
fairfield
yes
a
flotation
tank
combined
with
floride
breathing
waterref
the
abyss
breathing
solution
i
think
also
the
right
position
of
the
astronaut
and
strapping
you
can
probably
get
much
more
than
gs
in
an
accesloration
more
like
near
g
or
somewhat
less
saw
i
book
called
the
time
master
i
thjink
that
was
the
title
that
had
some
ideas
on
how
fast
and
all
you
could
