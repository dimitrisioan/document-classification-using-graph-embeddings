question
is
can
someone
give
me
examples
of
direct
nasaspace
related
research
that
helped
humanity
in
general
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
pat
tang
mylar
i
think
i
think
they
also
pushed
hi
tech
pat
composites
for
airframes
look
at
fly
by
wire
swept
wingsif
you
fly
in
airliners
youve
reaped
the
benefits
phil
didnt
one
of
the
early
jet
fighters
have
these
i
also
think
phil
the
germans
did
some
work
on
these
in
wwii
the
naca
came
up
with
them
before
world
war
ii
nasa
is
directly
descended
from
the
naca
with
space
added
in
youll
notice
that
i
didnt
mention
sweep
wings
even
though
the
x
tested
at
whats
now
dryden
had
them
we
did
steal
that
one
dirctly
from
the
germans
the
difference
is
that
swept
wings
dont
change
their
angle
of
sweep
sweep
wings
do
perhaps
the
similarity
of
names
has
caused
some
confusion
s
have
swept
wings
fs
have

winglets

digital
fly

ride
smoothing
phil
a
lot
of
this
was
also
done
by
the
military
after
nasa
aerodynamicists
proposed
them
and
nasa
test
teams
demonstrated
them
richard
whitcomb
and
rt
jones
at
langley
research
center
were
giants
in
the
field
dryden
was
involved
in
the
flight
testing
of
winglets
and
area
ruling
in
the
s
and
s
respectively
its
true
that
we
used
military
aircraft
as
the
testbeds
kc
and
yf
but
that
had
more
to
do
with
availability
and
need
than
with
military
involvement
the
yf
was
completely
ours
and
the
kc
was
bailed
to
us
the
air
force
of
course
was
interested
in
our
results
and
supportive
of
our
efforts
dryden
flew
the
first
digital
fly
by
wire
aircraft
in
the
s
no
mechnaical
or
analog
backup
to
show
you
how
confident
we
were
general
dynamics
decided
to
make
the
f
flybywire
when
they
saw
how
successful
we
were
mind
you
the
avro
arrow
and
the
x
were
both
flybywire
aircraft
much
earlier
but
analog
phil
egad
im
disagreeing
with
mary
shafer
the
nasa
habit
of
acquiring
secondhand
military
aircraft
and
using
them
for
testbeds
can
make
things
kind
of
confusing
on
the
other
hand
all
those
secondhand
navy
planes
give
our
test
pilots
a
chance
to
fold
the
wingssomething
most
pilots
at
