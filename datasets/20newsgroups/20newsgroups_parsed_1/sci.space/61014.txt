why
do
spacecraft
have
to
be
shut
off
after
funding
cuts
for
example
why
couldnt
magellan
just
be
told
to
go
into
a
safe
mode
and
stay
bobbing
about
venus
in
a
lowpoweruse
mode
and
if
maybe
in
a
few
years
if
funding
gets
restored
after
the
economy
gets
better
hopefully
it
could
be
turned
on
again
one
consideration
to
remember
is
that
if
you
dont
turn
it
off
now
you
may
not
be
able
to
later
this
isnt
a
case
of
reaching
over
and
flipping
a
switch
much
of
the
spacecraft
has
to
be
working
correctly
to
execute
a
turn
off
command
successfully
spacecraft
do
malfunction
in
their
old
age
the
big
concern
is
not
radio
clutter
from
idle
spacecraft
but
radio
clutter
from
malfunctioning
spacecraft
that
can
no
longer
be
turned
off
all
work
is
one
mans
work
