answer
to
a
question
from
hawking
chahine
described
a
proposed
dragfree
satellite
but
confirmed
that
at
this
point
its
only
a
concept
so
whats
a
drag
free
satellite
coated
with
wd
i
am
puzzled
by
the
term
concept
drag
free
may
already
have
been
flown
it
was
the
idea
behind
putting
up
a
spacecraft
that
would
more
accurately
respond
to
motions
from
the
earths
gravity
field
and
ignore
drag
it
was
proposed
many
years
ago
and
involved
a
ball
floating
between
sensors
whose
job
it
was
to
signal
to
little
adjustment
jets
to
keep
the
ball
away
from
them
the
ball
itself
would
then
be
in
a
drag
free
condition
and
respond
only
to
gravity
anisotropies
whereas
the
spacecraft
itself
would
be
continuously
adjusting
its
position
to
compensate
for
drag
