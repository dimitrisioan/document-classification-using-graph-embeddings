having
read
in
the
past
about
the
failsafe
mechanisms
on
spacecraft
i
had
assumed
that
the
command
loss
timer
had
that
sort
of
function
however
i
always
find
disturbing
the
oxymoron
of
a
noop
command
that
does
something
if
the
command
changes
the
behavior
or
status
of
the
spacecraft
it
is
not
a
noop
command
i
know
its
semantics
but
the
noop
doesnt
do
anything
the
command
loss
timer
is
simply
looking
for
a
command
any
command
a
noop
is
simply
a
spacecraft
command
that
drops
bits
into
the
big
bit
bucket
in
the
sky
noop
also
get
used
as
timekeepers
to
provide
millisecond
delays
between
command
sequences
used
on
the
thruster
preps
on
gro
er
compton
and
to
verify
command
links
at
the
beginning
of
tdrs
events
all
in
all
a
rather
useful
command
and
an
intelligent
fdc
test
on
galileo
the
command
loss
timer
