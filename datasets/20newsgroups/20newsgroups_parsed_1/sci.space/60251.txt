of
course
the
units
of
force
have
the
same
names
as
those
of
weight
but
in
order
to
use
them
you
need
to
keep
useful
constants
like
the
omnipresent
ftsec
around
maybe
youd
like
to
go
over
again
how
this
system
is
so
natural
and
so
easy
to
use
gary
while
youre
at
it
you
can
figure
out
for
us
the
weight
of
barrels
and
a
quart
of
foo

cubic

lets
face
it
even
the
imperial
system
uses
a
basically
metric
way
of
relating
quantities
ie
that
would
be
written
as
ftsec
the
only
thing
youre
hanging
on
to
is
the
right
to
express
the
same
quantity
as
inches
feet
yards
or
chains
what
everyone
else
is
saying
is
why
do
you
want
to
do
that
any
apparent
remaining
complexity
in
the
si
system
is
due
to
the
multiplicity
of
the
aforesaid
prefixes
in
fact
whats
going
on
and
the
fundamental
difference
between
si
and
imperial
is
that
you
have
exactly
one
unit
of
each
type
and
all
values
of
that
type
are
expressed
as
some
multiple
of
the
unit
you
mean
like
seconds
minutes
hours
days
months
years
remember
the
fahrenheit
temperature
scale
is
also
a
centigrade
scale
some
revisionists
tell
the
history
something
like
this
the
coldest
point
in
a
particular
russian
winter
was
marked
on
the
thermometer
as
was
the
body
temperature
of
a
volunteer
turns
out
he
was
sick
but
you
cant
win
em
all
then
the
space
in
between
the
marks
on
the
thermometer
was
then
divided
into
hundredths
fwiw
doug
page
the
opinions
are
mine
maybe
and
do
not
necessarily
represent
those
of
my
employer
or
any
other
sane
person
fot
that
matter
