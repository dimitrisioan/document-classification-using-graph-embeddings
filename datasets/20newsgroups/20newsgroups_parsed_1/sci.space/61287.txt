john

said
jfc
if
gamma
ray
bursters
are
extragalactic
would
absorption
from
the
jfc
galaxy
be
expected
how
transparent
is
the
galactic
core
to
gamma
jfc
rays
and
later
jim
batka
said
jb
so
if
the
r
law
is
incorrect
assume
jb
some
unknown
material
dark
matter
inhibits
gamma
ray
propagation
jb
could
it
be
possible
that
we
are
actually
seeing
much
less
energetic
jb
events
happening
much
closer
to
us
the
even
distribution
could
jb
be
caused
by
the
characteristic
propagation
distance
of
gamma
rays
jb
being
shorter
then
the
thickness
of
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
well
maybe
not
zero
but
very
little
at
the
typical
energies
for
gamma
rays
the
galaxy
is
effectively
transparent
