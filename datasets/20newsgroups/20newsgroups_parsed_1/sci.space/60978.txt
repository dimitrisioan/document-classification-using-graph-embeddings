i
saw
in
the
newspaper
last
night
that
dr
mae
jemison
the
first
black
woman
in
space
shes
a
physician
and
chemical
engineer
who
flew
on
endeavour
last
year
will
appear
as
a
transporter
operator
on
the
star
trek
the
next
generation
episode
that
airs
the
week
of
may
its
hardly
space
science
i

but
its
interesting
doug
loss
interesting
is
rigth
i
wonder
if
they
will
make
a
mention
of
her
being
an
astronaut
in
the
credits
i
think
it
might
help
people
connect
the
future
of
space
with
the
present
and
give
them
an
idea
that
we
must
go
into
space
