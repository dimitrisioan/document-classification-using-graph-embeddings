after
all
the
space
walking
they
are
going
to
reboost
the
hsts
orbit
i
think
right
now
its
sitting
at
miles
up
they
would
like
i
dont
know
the
exact
orbit
numbers
as
ben
says
this
reboost
idea
is
all
news
to
us
here
do
you
know
something
we
dont
please
supply
a
source
it
would
be
nice
for
the
schedulers
of
observations
to
know
where
the
thing
is
going
to
be
these
altitude
numbers
are
also
way
off
my
best
source
has
minimum
st
altitude
in
the
pmdb
is
kilometers
maximum
st
altitude
in
the
pmdb
is
kilometers
delta
st
altitude
in
the
pmdb
is
kilometers
pmdb
is
proposal
management
data
base
used
to
schedule
observations
in
order
to
perform
the
reboost
of
the
hst
the
oms
engines
will
be
fired
for
a
long
period
now
the
shuttle
is
a
heavy
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
oms
fuel
needed
to
fly
both
up
is
substantial
a
small
booster
carried
up
and
used
to
boost
hst
on
its
own
will
weigh
significantly
less
then
the
oms
fuel
required
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttle
for
a
given
orbital
change
could
you
supply
some
calculations
you
might
check
some
recent
postings
that
explained
that
a
small
booster
as
suggested
does
not
now
exist
so
comparing
the
mass
of
something
that
doesnt
exist
to
the
mass
of
the
oms
fuel
seems
impossible
the
contamination
threat
also
remains
or
the
hst
could
even
get
placed
into
some
sort
of
medium
orbit
the
reason
they
want
a
high
orbit
is
less
antenna
pointing
and
longer
drag
life
longer
drag
life
i
can
understand
but
could
you
explain
the
antenna
pointing
whatever
it
is
the
problem
in
the
tilt
array
is
a
big
constraint
on
hst
ops
tell
me
about
it
although
the
arrays
can
be
and
are
moved
perfectly
well
utilizing
the
second
electronics
box
getting
them
both
working
is
much
desireable
so
as
to
reclaim
redundancy
pat
i
dont
mean
to
jump
on
you
helpful
suggestions
are
always
welcome
and
we
all
know
the
more
ideas
the
better
but
i
do
want
the
true
situation
to
be
described
clearly
and
correctly
lest
some
get
confused
