from
in
article
pat
writes
what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
my
own
pet
theory
is
that
its
flying
saucers
entering
hyperspace
but
the
reason
i
am
asking
is
that
most
everyone
assumes
that
they
are
colliding
nuetron
stars
or
spinning
black
holes
i
just
wondered
if
any
mechanism
could
exist
and
place
them
closer
in
pat
well
lets
seei
took
a
class
on
this
last
fall
and
i
have
no
notes
so
ill
try
to
wing
it
heres
how
i
understand
it
remember
from
stellar
evolution
that
black
holes
and
neutron
starspulsars
are
formed
from
high
mass
stars
mstarmsun
high
mass
stars
live
fast
and
burn
hard
taking
appoximately
years
before
going
nova
or
supernova
in
this
time
they
dont
live
long
enough
to
get
perturbed
out
of
the
galactic
plane
so
any
of
these
if
assumed
to
be
the
sources
of
grbs
will
be
in
the
plane
of
the
galaxy
then
we
take
the
catalog
of
bursts
that
have
been
recieved
from
the
various
satellites
around
the
solar
system
pioneer
venus
has
one
either
pion
or
ginga
and
of
course
batse
and
we
do
distribution
tests
on
our
catalog
these
tests
all
show
that
the
bursts
have
an
isotropic
distributionevenly
spread
out
in
a
radial
direction
and
they
show
signs
of
homogeneity
ie
they
do
not
clump
in
any
one
direction
so
unless
we
are
sampling
the
area
inside
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
we
are
sampling
the
universe
not
cool
if
you
want
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
caused
these
things
now
i
suppose
you
are
saying
well
we
stil
only
may
be
sampling
from
inside
the
disk
well
not
necessarily
remember
we
have
what
is
more
or
less
an
interplanetary
network
of
burst
detectors
with
a
baseline
that
goes
waaaay
out
to
beyond
plutopioneer
so
we
should
be
able
with
all
of
our
detectors
de
tect
some
sort
of
difference
in
angle
from
satellite
to
satellite
heres
an
analogy
you
see
a
plane
overhead
you
measure
the
angle
of
the
plane
from
the
origin
of
your
arbitrary
coordinate
system
one
of
your
friends
a
mile
away
sees
the
same
plane
and
measures
the
angle
from
the
zero
point
of
his
arbitrary
system
which
is
the
same
as
yours
the
two
angles
are
different
and
you
should
be
able
to
triangulate
the
position
of
your
burst
and
maybe
find
a
source
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
been
able
to
do
this
i
should
throw
in
why
halo
and
corona
models
dont
work
also
as
i
said
before
looking
at
the
possible
astrophysics
of
the
bursts
short
timescales
high
energy
black
holes
and
pulsars
exhibit
much
of
this
type
of
behavior
if
this
is
the
case
as
i
said
before
these
stars
seem
to
be
bound
to
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
especially
the
most
energetic
of
the
these
sources
when
you
look
at
a
simulated
model
where
the
bursts
are
confined
to
the
disk
but
you
sample
out
to
large
distances
say
mpc
you
should
definitely
see
not
only
an
anisotropy
towards
you
in
all
direction
but
a
clumping
of
sources
in
the
direction
of
the
galactic
center
as
i
said
before
there
is
none
of
these
characteristics
i
think
thats
all
of
itif
someone
needs
clarification
or
knows
something
that
i
dont
know
by
all
means
correct
me
i
had
the
honor
of
taking
the
bursts
class
with
the
person
who
has
done
the
modeling
of
these
different
distributions
so
we
pretty
much
kicked
around
every
possible
distribution
there
was
and
some
very
outrageous
sources
colliding
pulsars
black
holes
pulsars
that
are
slowing
downstuff
like
that
its
a
fun
field
complaints
and
corrections
to
or
