maybe
you
dont
mind
having
every
part
of
your
life
saturated
with
commercials
but
many
of
us
loathe
it
while
im
sure
sagan
considers
it
sacrilegious
that
wouldnt
be
because
of
his
doubtfull
credibility
as
an
astronomer
modern
groundbased
visible
light
astronomy
what
these
proposed
orbiting
billboards
would
upset
is
already
a
dying
field
the
opacity
and
distortions
caused
by
the
atmosphere
itself
have
driven
most
of
the
field
to
use
radio
far
infrared
or
spacebased
telescopes
in
any
case
a
bright
point
of
light
passing
through
the
field
doesnt
ruin
observations
if
that
were
the
case
the
thousands
of
existing
satellites
would
have
already
done
so
satelliets
might
not
seem
so
bright
to
the
eyes
but
as
far
as
astronomy
is
concerned
they
are
extremely
bright
frank

cu
boulder
tell
that
to
the
people
who
run
the
meter
keck
telescope
or
the
astronomers
and
engineers
working
on
the
gemini
twin
meter
telescope
project
it
took
years
to
build
keck
i
and
now
they
are
building
keck
ii
according
to
the
december
sky
telescope
this
second
meter
eye
will
convert
the
facility
into
a
binocular
telescope
with
double
the
lightgathering
power
and
the
ability
to
resolve
the

of
a

japans
meter
subaru
telescope
will
soon
join
keck
on
mauna
kea
all
these
telescopes
will
work
in
the
infrared
yes
but
they
are
visible
light
telescopes
and
havent
you
heard
anything
about
adaptive
optics
a
lot
of
research
was
done
with
star
wars
funding
and
some
is
now
being
shared
with
astronomers
this
shows
great
promise
soon
probably
within
a
few
years
even
the
largest
telescopes
will
be
able
to
resolve
to
their
theoretical
limit
despite
the
distortions
of
the
atmosphere
to
say
that
visible
light
astronomy
is
already
a
dying
field
is
pure
hokum
to
use
the
logic
that
things
are
already
bad
so
it
doesnt
matter
if
it
gets
worse
is
absurd
maybe
common
sense
and
logic
are
the
dying
fields
