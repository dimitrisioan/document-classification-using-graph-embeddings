besides
the
mechanical
problems
of
moving
so
dense
a
medium
in
oan
out
of
the
lungs
diaphragm
fatigue
etc
is
there
likely
to
be
a
problem
with
the
mixture
i
mean
since
the
lungs
never
expel
all
the
air
in
them
the
inhaled
air
has
to
mix
pretty
quickly
with
the
residual
air
in
the
lungs
to
provide
a
useful
partial
pressure
of
oxygen
right
would
this
mixing
be
substantially
fasterslower
at
the
pressures
were
talking
about
there
was
an
interesting
article
in
scientific
american
some
time
ago
about
breathing
liquid
it
was
a
few
months
before
the
abyss
came
out
as
far
as
i
can
remember
they
mentioned
three
things
that
were
difficult
to
do
at
once
with
a
substitute
breathing
fluid
low
viscosity
if
its
too
difficult
to
force
the
fluid
in
out
of
the
lungs
you
cant
extract
enough
oxygen
to
power
your
own
breathing
effort
let
alone
anything
else
diffusion
rate
obviously
not
all
the
air
in
your
lungs
is
expelled
when
you
breathe
out
and
the
part
that
isnt
expelled
is
the
part
thats
nearest
the
walls
of
the
alveoli
alveolus
so
the
trip
from
the
blood
vessels
to
the
new
air
has
to
be
done
by
diffusion
of
the
gas
through
the
fluid
apparently
oxygen
tends
to
diffuse
more
readily
than
co
so
even
if
you
can
get
enough
oxygen
in
you
might
not
be
able
to
get
enough
co
out
oxygenco
capacity
you
have
to
be
able
to
dissolve
enough
gas
per
unit
volume
oh
and
of
course
your
new
breathing
fluid
must
not
irritate
the
lungs
or
interfere
with
their
healing
or
anything
like
that
