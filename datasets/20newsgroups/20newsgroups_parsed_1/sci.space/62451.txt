is
it
not
also
an
abomination
that
somebody
would
spend
money
on
space
advertising
when
those
children
are
starving
perhaps
some
redistribution
of
wealth
would
help
them
dan
not
to
flame
really
but
thats
an
abominable
viewpoint
while
were
on
the
subject
of
abominations
if
we
followed
the
redistiribution
of
wealth
and
by
the
way
ist
that
what
clinto
and
the
democrats
are
trying
to
do
everyone
would
starve
in
short
order
not
only
is
it
impossoble
to
organize
a
fair
distribution
that
depends
on
every
womans
altruism
can
you
say
black
market
under
communisim
anyone
but
the
current
methods
of
resource
production
are
entirely
energy
dependant
there
are
not
enough
sources
of
cheap
capital
aside
from
human
capital
to
allow
us
to
stop
looking
at
space
a
an
excellent
source
of
materials
and
realestate
more
directly
perhaps
you
mioght
consider
the
fact
that
billions
are
spent
by
tv
companies
and
their
sponsors
abc
nbc
cbs
on
the
superbowl
the
olympics
and
even
on
monday
night
baseball
games
perhaps
we
should
boycott
those
games
if
dcx
and
company
get
finished
and
there
is
a
market
for
it
those
abominable
space
will
probably
be
much
more
cost
effective
for
the
companies
and
those
starving
children
more
people
buy
products
the
company
hires
more
workers
end
result
fewer
children
die
of
starvation
