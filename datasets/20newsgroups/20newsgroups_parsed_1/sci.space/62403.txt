i
dont
think
that
idea
means
what
you
think
it
does
having
everyone
on
earth
subject
to
some
ad
agencys
poor
taste
is
an
abomination
well
we
already
suffer
from
street
hoardings
if
you
dont
watch
tv
you
are
free
of
commercials
there
but
if
you
want
to
go
from
a
to
b
you
can
not
escape
beer
ads
us
loathe
it
id
rather
not
have
the
beauty
of
the
night
sky
always
marred
by
a
giant
billboard
and
ill
bet
the
idea
is
virtually
sacrilegious
to
an
astronomer
like
sagan
i
think
the
right
time
to
stop
this
proposal
is
now
if
this
idea
goes
through
its
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
soon
companies
will
be
doing
larger
and
more
permanant
billboards
in
the
sky
i
wouldnt
want
a
world
a
few
decades
from
now
when
the
sky
looks
like
las
vegas
that
would
really
make
me
sad
coca
cola
company
will
want
to
paint
the
moon
red
and
white
well
if
not
this
moon
then
a
moon
of
jupiter
microscum
will
want
to
name
a
galaxy
microscum
galaxy
where
do
we
draw
the
line
historically
mankind
is
not
very
good
at
drawing
fine
lines
im
normally
extremely
enthusiastic
about
all
forms
of
resource
allocation
for
space
research
i
think
its
the
most
important
investment
possible
for
mankind
in
the
long
run
but
this
is
not
the
way
to
get
the
money
