development

hausner
pontificated
sorry
to
split
hairs
but
i
just
read
in
the
making
of
the
atomic
bomb
that
teflon
was
developed
during
world
war
a
sealant
was
needed
for
the
tubing
in
which
uranium
hexafluoride
passed
as
it
was
gradually
enriched
by
difussion
uf
is
very
corrosive
and
some
very
inert
yet
flexible
material
was
needed
for
the
seals
to
split
a
split
hair
i
believe
that
teflon
cf
monomer
was
discovered
by
accident
when
someone
i
dont
remember
found
what
he
thought
was
a
liquid
or
gas
had
turned
to
a
solid
it
just
happend
to
fit
the
bill
for
the
above
use
im
crossposting
to
scimaterials
so
perhaps
someone
in
the
know
might
elaborate

i
know
you
believe
you
understand
what
it
is
that
you
think
i
said
but
i
am
not
sure
that
you
realize
that
what
i
said
is
not
what
i
meant
