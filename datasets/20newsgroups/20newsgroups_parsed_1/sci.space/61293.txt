what
they
feed
to

most
has
been

already

there
are
a

redesign

update
following
is
the
weekly
status
on
redesign
based
on
information
provided
by
nasa
headquarters
the
station
redesign
team
srt
provided
a
detailed
status
report
to
the
advisory
committee
on
the
redesign
of
the
space
station
on
april
the
daylong
meeting
was
held
in
anser
facilities
in
crystal
city
va
topics
covered
by
the
srt
included
a
preliminary
mission
and
goals
statement
for
the
space
station
science
technology
and
engineering
research
the
assessment
process
and
the
design
approach
discussions
on
management
options
and
operations
concepts
also
were
held
the
design
teams
then
presented
the
three
options
under
study
¥
option
a
modular

pete

presented
the
a
option
priest
said
the
team
is
working
to
define
a
station
that
meets
cost
goals
and
has
identified
three
distinct
phases
of
evolution
power
station
human
tended
and
permanent
presence
the
team
will
define
the
minimum
capability
needed
to
achieve
each
phase
the
total
cost
of
each
phase
and
the
achievable
capability
for
budget
levels
the
a
option
uses
current
or
simplified
freedom
hardware
where
cost
effective
and
is
considering
other
existing
systems
such
as
the
socalled
bus
spacecraft
the
orbiter
and
spacelab
the
power

capability
could
be
achieved
in

missions
docked
to

are
assumed
for
this

human

capability
would
be
provided
by
the
addition
of
the

common
module
module
which
adds
subsystems
and
payload

are
being
studied
for

griffin
detailed
the
evolution
of
the

from
initial

capability
to
humantended
capability
to
permanent

griffin
also
outlined

with
minor
changes
to
the
communications

tracking
system
crew
health

system
and
eclss
and
a
major
change
to
the

would
be
achieved

would
build
out
the

with
another

systems
the
freedom

could
achieve
an

three
more
flights
to
bring
up
the

griffin
told
the
redesign
advisory
committee
that
eliminating
hardware
would
not
by
itself
meet
budget
guidelines
for
the
freedom
derived
option
major
reductions
or
deferrals
must
occur
in
other
areas
including
program

the

core
station
concept
a
shuttle
external
tank
and
solid
rocket
boosters
would
be
used
to
launch
the
station
into
orbit
shuttle
main
engines
would
be
mounted
to
the
tail
of
the
station
module
for
launch
and
jettisoned
after
et
separation
the

feet
in
diameter
and
feet
long
would
provide
cubic
feet
of
pressured

separated
into

connected
by
a
centralized

seven
berthing
ports
would
be
located
at
various
places
on
the
circumference
of
the
module
to
place
the
international
modules
and
other
