hello
netters
im
new
to
this
board
and
i
thought
this
might
be
the
best
place
for
my
post
i
have
a
question
regarding
satellite
technology
seen
in
the
movie
patriot
games
in
the
movies
the
cia
utilizes
its
orbitting
sats
to
pinpoint
a
specific
terrorist
camp
in
n
africa
the
photos
taken
by
the
sats
are
stunning
i
know
that

are
capable
of
photographing
the
license
plates
of
vehicles
my
question
is
this
the
camp

question
was
taken
out
by
the
british
sas
and
while
the
sas
was
in
action
the
cia
team
was
watching
in
the
warroom
back
in
langley
va
the
action
of
the
sas
was
clear
and
appeared
to
be
relayed
via
a
sat
the
action
was
at
night
and
the
photography
appeared
to
be
an
xray
type
that
is
one
could
see
the
action
within
the
tentsstructures
of
the
camp

techology
