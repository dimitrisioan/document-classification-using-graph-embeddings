re
gamma
ray
bursters
where
are
they
pat
writes
we
know
its
not
real
close
like
slightly
extra
solar
because
we
have
no
parallax
measurements
on
the
bursts
we
can
only
say
that
they
are
beyond
about
au
due
to
the
low
accuracy
of
position
determination
by
single
detectors
what
i
am
wondering
is
this
in
peoples
opinion
a
new
physics
problem
einstein
got
well
known
for
solvingthe
photoelectric
effect
copernicus
started
looking
at
irregularities
in
planetary
motion
is
this
a
big
enough
problem
to
create
a
new
area
of
physics
just
a
little
speculative
thinking
folks
it
may
be
a
new
physics
problem
ie
a
problem
involving
new
physics
however
the
data
is
not
good
enough
to
rule
out
the
models
which
use
old
physics
new
physics
is
a
big
step
and
is
only
tolerated
when
there
is
no
alternative
for
example
the
dark
matter
problem
theres
more
to
the
universe
than
meets
the
eye
is
a
question
of
comparable
mystery
to
grbs
but
we
have
much
better
data
regarding
it
theoreticians
postulate
new
particles
all
the
time
to
explain
it
but
no
one
will
actually
believe
that
these
particles
are
real
until
an
experimentalist
or
several
detects
them
in
the
lab
