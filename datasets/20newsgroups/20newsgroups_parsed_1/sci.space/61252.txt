where
are
they
i
assume
that
can
only
be
guessed
at
by
the
assumed
energy
of
the
event
and
the
r
law
so
if
the
r
law
is
incorrect
assume
some
unknown
material
dark
matter
inhibits
gamma
ray
propagation
could
it
be
possible
that
we
are
actually
seeing
much
less
energetic
events
happening
much
closer
to
us
the
even
distribution
could
be
caused
by
the
characteristic
propagation
distance
of
gamma
rays
being
shorter
then
the
thickness

the
