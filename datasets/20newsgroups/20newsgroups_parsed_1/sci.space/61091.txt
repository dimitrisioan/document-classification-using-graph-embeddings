swear

i
also
find
the
choice
of
newsgroups
interesting
perhaps
someone
should
tell
this
guy
that
sciastro
doesnt
stand
for
astrology
its
truly
frightening
that
posts
like
this
are
originating
at
what
are
ostensibly
centers
of
higher
learning
in
this
country
small
wonder
that
the
rest
of
the
world
thinks
were
all
nuts
and
that
we
have
the
problems
that
we
do
in
case
you
havent
gotten
it
yet
david
i
dont
think
this
was
quite
appropriate
for
a
posting
to
sci
groups
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
