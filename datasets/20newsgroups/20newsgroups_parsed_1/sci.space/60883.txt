re
comet
in
temporary
orbit
around
jupiter
can
these
questions
be
answered
for
a
previous
instance
such
as
the
gehrels
that
was
mentioned
in
an
earlier
posting
orbital
elements
of
comet

thanks
for
the
information
i
assume
p
is
the
semimajor
axis
and
e
the
eccentricity
the
peri
helion
and
aphelion
are
then
given
by
pe
and
pe
ie
about
and
au
respectively
for
jupiter
they
are
and
au
if
was
after
the
temporary
capture
this
means
that
the
comet
ended
up
in
an
orbit
that
comes
no
closer
than
au
to
jupiters
which
i
take
to
be
a
rough
indication
of
how
far
from
jupiter
it
could
get
under
jupiters
influence
also
perihelions
of
gehrels
were
april
jupiter
radii
august
jupiter
radii
where
jupiter
radius
km
mi
au
so
the
figure
seems
unlikely
to
actually
be
anything
but
a
perijove
is
that
the
case
for
the
figure
