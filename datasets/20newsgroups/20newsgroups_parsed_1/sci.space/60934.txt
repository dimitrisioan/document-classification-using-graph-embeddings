lets
play
a
game
what
would
be
a
reasonable
reward
what
companies
would
have
a
reasonable
shot
at
pulling
off
such
a
feat
just
where
in
the
budget
would
the
reward
come
from
should
there
be
a
time
limit
would
a
straight
cash
money
award
be
enough
or
should
we
throw
in
say
exclusive
mining
rights
for
the
first
fifty
years
you
get
the
idea
a
cash
award
is
ok
a
time
limit
would
be
nice
you
cant
give
away
mining
rights
assuming
theres
anything
to
mine
because
you
dont
own
them
sig
files
are
like
strings

yoyos
got

nicholls
business
or
