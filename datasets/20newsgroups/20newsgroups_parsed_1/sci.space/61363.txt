i
have
never
heard
of
any
serious
consideration
that
hst
might
be
brought
down
for
refurbishment
you
would
have
the
horrendous
cost
of
transporting
back
in
january
and
february
there
were
several
articles
wash
post
time
saying
that
nasa
was
considering
the
option
just
as
it
is
now
considering
a
followup
mission
months
after
the
servicing
mission
however
the
down
time
was
estimated
to
be
a
year
servicing
checkout
sceheduling
and
training
another
shuttle
orbit
verification
and
to
be
quite
expensive
i
think
it
may
have
been
more
a
mental
exercise
than
a
real
plan
dont
know
robert
dempsey
stscipodps
he
which
hath
no
stomach
for
this
fight
let
him
depart
his
passport
shall
be
made
and
crowns
for
convoy
put
into
his
purse
we
would
not
die
in
this
mans
company
that
fears
his
fellowship
to
die
with
us
