sorry
if
i
do
not
have
the
big
degrees
and
such
but
i
think
i
might
be
wrong
to
error
is
human
i
have
something
that
is
in
many
ways
just
as
important
i
have
imagination
dreams
and
without
dreams
all
the
knowledge
is
worthless
oh
and
us
with
the
big
degrees
dont
got
imagination
huh
the
alleged
dichotomy
between
imagination
and
knowledge
is
one
of
the
most
pernicious
fallacys
of
the
new
age
michael
thanks
for
the
generous
offer
but
we
have
quite
enough
dreams
of
our
own
thank
you
well
said
you
on
the
other
hand
are
letting
your
own
dreams
go
to
waste
by
failing
to
get
the
mathsthermodynamicschemistryyour
choices
here
which
would
give
your
imagination
wings
just
to
show
this
isnt
a
flame
i
leave
you
with
a
quote
from
invasion
of
the
body
snatchers
become
one
of
us
its
not
so
bad
you
know
okay
del
so
michael
was
being
unfair
but
you
are
being
unfair
back
he
is
taking
college
courses
now
i
presume
he
is
studying
hard
and
his
postings
reveal
that
he
is
somewhat
hip
to
the
technical
issues
of
astronautics
plus
he
is
attentively
following
the
erudite
discourse
of
the
big
brains
who
post
to
scispace
is
it
not
inevitable
that
he
will
get
a
splendid
technical
education
from
reading
the
likes
of
you
and
me
like
others
involved
in
scispace
mr
adams
shows
symptoms
of
being
a
fledgling
member
of
the
technoculture
and
i
think
hes
soaking
it
up
fast
i
was
a
young
guy
with
dreams
once
and
they
led
me
to
get
a
technical
education
to
follow
them
up
too
bad
i
wound
up
in
an
assemblyline
job
stamping
out
identical
neutrinos
day
after
day
though
rumors
persist
that
del
and
i
are
both
pseudonyms
