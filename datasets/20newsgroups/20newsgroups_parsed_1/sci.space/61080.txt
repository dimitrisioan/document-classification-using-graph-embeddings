as
a
private
venture
assuming
you
could

government
into
leasing
you
a
couple
of
pads
in
florida
why
would
you
want
to
do
that
the
goal
is
to
do
it
cheaper

this
isnt
government
instead
of
leasing
an
expensive
launch
pad
just
use
a
ssto
and
launch
from
a
much
cheaper
facility

into
making
statement
without
thinking
them
out
wan
na
guess
which
