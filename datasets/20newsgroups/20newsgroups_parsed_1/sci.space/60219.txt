todays
new
york
times
just
wrote
about
a
pact
being
negotiated
between
us
and
the
russians
to
develope
high
temperature
gas
cooled
fission
reactors
using
recycled
weapons
grade
plutonium
from
warhead
stockpiles
the
fuel
will
be
pelletized
in
ceramic
for
safety
and
then
after
depletion
will
be
sufficiently
contaminated
with
byproducts
to
make
extraction
of
the
remaining
plutonium
hazardous
enough
to
deter
reuse
apparently
the
project
will
be
led
by
general
atomics
of
san
diego
with
funding
from
the
us
government
the
pilot
plant
will
be
built
and
operated
by
the
russians
