now
space
marketing
is
working
with
university
of
colorado
and
livermore
engineers
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflatable
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
the
real
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environment
the
platform
will
carry
ozone
monitors
i
cant
believe
that
a
milelong
billboard
would
have
any
significant
effect
on
the
overall
sky
brightness
venus
is
visible
during
the
day
but
nobody
complains
about
that
besides
its
in
leo
so
it
would
only
be
visible
during
twilight
when
the
sky
is
already
bright
and
even
if
it
would
have
some
miniscule
impact
it
would
be
only
for
a
short
time
as
it
goes
zipping
across
the
sky
ive
seen
satellites
at
midnight
theyre
not
only
in
twilight
o
from
the
book
prodigal
genius
the
life
of
nikola
tesla
by
john
j
oneill
this
remarkable
conductivity
of
gases
including
the
air
at
low
pressures
led
tesla
to
suggest
in
a
published
statement
in
a
system
of
lighting
on
a
terrestrial
scale
in
which
he
proposed
to
treat
the
whole
earth
with
its
surrounding
atmosphere
as
if
it
were
a
single
lamp
the
whole
earth
would
be
transformed
into
a
giant
lamp
with
the
night
sky
completely
illuminated
making
the
night
as
bright
as
day
now
my
comments
id
like
to
add
that
some
of
the
protests
do
not
come
from
a
strictly
practical
consideration
of
what
pollution
levels
are
acceptable
for
research
activities
by
professional
astronomers
some
of
what
i
would
complain
about
is
rooted
in
aesthetics
many
readers
may
never
have
known
a
time
where
the
heavens
were
pristine
sacred
unsullied
by
the
actions
of
humans
the
space
between
the
stars
as
profoundly
black
as
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizons
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
any
connection
with
the
petty
matters
of
man
any
lights
were
supplied
solely
by
nature
uncorruptable
by
men
whole
religions
were
based
on
mortal
man
somehow
getting
up
there
and
becoming
immortal
as
the
stars
whether
by
apotheosis
or
a
belief
in
an
afterlife
the
space
age
changed
all
that
the
effect
of
the
first
sputniks
and
echo
etc
on
this
view
could
only
happen
once
to
see
a
light
crossing
the
night
sky
and
know
it
was
put
there
by
us
puny
people
is
still
impressive
and
the
sense
of
size
one
gets
by
assimilating
the
scales
involved
is
also
awesome
even
if
the
few
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles
involved
is
still
dwarfed
by
the
rest
of
the
universe
but
there
is
still
a
hunger
for
the
pure
beauty
of
a
virgin
sky
yes
i
know
aircraft
are
almost
always
in
sight
i
have
to
live
in
a
very
populated
area
miles
from
an
international
airport
currently
where
light
pollution
on
the
ground
is
ghastly
the
impact
of
humans
is
so
extreme
here
virtually
no
place
exists
that
has
not
been
shaped
sculpted
modified
trashed
or
whipped
into
shape
by
the
hands
of
man
in
some
places
the
only
life
forms
larger
than
bacteria
are
humans
cockroaches
and
squirrels
or
rats
i
visited
some
friends
up
in
the
appalacian
mountains
one
weekend
getting
away
from
it
all
paved
roads
indoor
plumbing
malls
and
it
felt
good
for
a
while
then
i
quickly
noticed
the
hollow
was
directly
under
the
main
flight
path
into
dulles
miles
to
the
east
their
security
light
didnt
help
matters
much
either
but
ive
heard
the
artic
wilderness
gets
lots
of
high
air
traffic
so
i
know
the
skies
are
rarely
perfect
but
there
is
still
this
desire
to
see
a
place
that
man
hasnt
fouled
in
some
way
i
mean
theyve
been
trying
this
forever
like
concerning
teslas
idea
to
banish
night
wow
i
dont
watch
commercial
television
but
i
can
imagine
just
how
disgusting
beer
truck
or
hemmorrhoid
ointment
advertisements
would
be
if
seen
up
so
high
if
ya
got
ta
make
a
buck
on
it
displaying
products
in
heaven
at
least
consider
the
reactions
from
those
for
whom
the
sky
is
a
last
beautiful
refuge
from
the
baseness
of
modern
life
to
be
open
about
this
though
i
have
here
my
listing
of
the
passage
of
hst
in
the
evening
sky
for
this
weekend
tonight
friday
at
pm
edt
it
will
reach
an
altitude
of
degrees
on
the
local
meridian
from
baltimore
vicinity
ill
be
trying
to
see
it
if
i
can
it
is
my
mealticket
after
all
so
i
suppose
i
could
be
called
an
elitist
for
supporting
this
intrusion
on
the
night
sky
while
complaining
about
billboards
proposed
by
others
be
that
as
it
may
i
think
my
point
about
a
desire
for
beauty
is
valid
even
if
it
cant
ever
be
perfectly
achieved
