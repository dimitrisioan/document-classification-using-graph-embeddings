grazing
in

i
found
that
japan
has
some
optical
capabilities
along
this
line
and
also
uses
a
radar
designed
for
other
purposes
for
orbital

surveys
it
isnt
clear
whether
the
radar
can
determine
orbital
elements
for
the
objects
it
detects
abstracts

this
leads
to
the
more
general
question
do
yet
other
people
than
the
us
russia
and
japan
do
space
surveillance
and
if
so
how

are
very
