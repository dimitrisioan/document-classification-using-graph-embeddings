alternative
heavy
element
creation
in
universe
a
very
simple
experiment
can
demonstrate
prove
the
fact
of
biological
transmutations
reactions
like

n
co
etc
as
described
in
the
book
biological
transmutations
by
louis
kervran
edition
is
best
and
in
chapter
of
the
book
the
secret
life
of
plants
by
peter
tompkins
and
christopher
bird
obtain
a
good
sample
of
plant
seeds
all
of
the
same
kind
some
kinds
might
work
better
that
others
divide
the
sample
into
two
groups
of
equal
weight
and
number
sprout
one
group
in
distilled
water
on
filter
paper
for
three
or
four
weeks
separately
incinerate
both
groups
weigh
the
residue
from
each
group
the
residue
of
the
sprouted
group
will
usually
weigh
at
least
several
percent
more
than
the
other
group
analyze
quantitatively
the
residue
of
each
group
for
mineral
content
some
of
the
mineral
atoms
of
the
sprouted
group
have
been
transmuted
into
heavier
mineral
elements
by
fusing
with
atoms
of
oxygen
hydrogen
carbon
nitrogen
etc
biological
transmutations
occur
routinely
even
in
our
own
bodies
ingesting
a
source
of
organic
silicon
silicon
with
carbon
such
as
horsetail
extract
or
radishes
can
speed
healing
of
broken
bones
via
the
reaction
si
c
ca
much
faster
than
by
merely
ingesting
the
calcium
directly
some
mineral
deposits
in
the
ground
are
formed
by
micro
organisms
fusing
together
atoms
of
silicon
carbon
nitrogen
oxygen
hydrogen
etc
the
two
reactions
si
c
ca
by
microorganisms
cause
stone
sickness
in
statues
building
bricks
etc
the
reaction
n
co
catalysed
by
very
hot
iron
creates
a
carbonmonoxide
poison
hazard
for
welder
operators
and
people
near
woodstoves
even
properly
sealed
ones
some
bacteria
can
even
neutralize
radioactivity
all
of
these
things
and
more
happen
in
spite
of
the
currently
accepted
laws
of
physics
including
the
law
which
says
that
atomic
fusion
requires
extremely
high
temperatures
and
pressures
biological
transmutations
and
their
applications
in
chemistry
physics
biology
ecology
medicine
