simulation
ive
been
to
three
talks
in
the
last
month
which
might
be
of
interest
ive
transcribed
some
of
my
notes
below
since
my
note
taking
ability
is
by
no
means
infallible
please
assume
that
all
factual
errors
are
mine
permission
is
granted
to
copy
this
without
restriction
note
for
newbies
the
delta
clipper
project
is
geared
towards
producing
a
single
staget
to
orbit
reusable
launch
vehicle
the
dcx
vehicle
is
a
scale
vehicle
designed
to
test
some
of
the
concepts
invovled
in
ssto
it
is
currently
undergoing
tests
the
dcy
vehicle
would
be
a
full
scale
experimental
vehicle
capable
of
reaching
orbit
it
has
not
yet
been
funded
on
april
th
rocky
nelson
of
macdonnell
douglas
gave
a
talk
entitled
optimizing
techniques
for
advanced
space
missions
here
at
the
university
of
illinois
mr
nelsons
job
involves
using
software
to
simulate
trajectories
and
determine
the
optimal
trajectory
within
given
requirements
although
he
is
not
directly
involved
with
the
delta
clipper
project
he
has
spent
time
with
them
recently
using
his
software
for
their
applications
he
thus
used
the
dcy
project
for
most
of
his
examples
while
i
dont
think
the
details
of
implicit
trajectory
simulation
are
of
much
interest
to
the
readers
i
hope
they
arent
i
fell
asleep
during
that
part
i
think
that
many
of
you
will
be
interested
in
some
of
the
details
gleaned
from
the
examples
the
first
example
given
was
the
maximization
of
payload
for
a
polar
orbit
the
main
restriction
is
that
acceleration
must
remain
below
gs
i
assume
that
this
is
driven
by
passenger
constraints
rather
than
hardware
constraints
but
i
did
not
verify
that
the
delta
clipper
y
version
has
engines
boosters
and
sustainers
the
boosters
which
have
a
lower
isp
are
shut
down
in
midflight
thus
one
critical
question
is
when
to
shut
them
down
mr
nelson
showed
the
following
plot
of
acceleration
vs
time
g
as
ascii
graphs
go
this
is
actually
fairly
good
the
big
difference
is
that
the
lines
g
made
by
the
should
be
curves
which
are
concave
up
the
data
is
only
approximate
as
the
graph
wasnt
up
for
very
long
g
g
sec
sec
as
mentioned
before
a
critical
constraint
is
that
g
levels
must
be
kept
below
initially
all
eight
engines
are
started
as
the
vehicle
burns
fuel
the
accelleration
increases
as
it
gets
close
to
g
the
booster
engines
are
throtled
back
however
they
quickly
become
inefficient
at
low
power
so
it
soon
makes
more
sense
to
cut
them
off
altogether
this
causes
the
dip
in
accelleration
at
about
seconds
eventually
the
remaining
sustainer
engines
bring
the
g
level
back
up
to
about
and
then
hold
it
there
until
they
cut
out
entirely
the
engine
cutoff
does
not
acutally
occur
in
orbit
the
trajectory
is
aimed
for
an
altitude
slightly
higher
than
the
nm
desired
and
the
last
vestiges
of
air
drag
slow
the
vehicle
slightly
thus
lowering
the
final
altitude
to
that
desired
questions
from
the
audience
paraphrased
q
would
it
make
sense
to
shut
down
the
booster
engines
in
pairs
rather
than
all
at
once
a
very
perceptive
worth
considering
they
have
not
yet
done
the
simulation
shutting
down
all
four
was
part
of
the
problem
as
given
q
so
what
was
the
final
payload
for
this
trajectory
a
cant
tell
us
read
aviation
leak
he
also
apparently
had
a
good
propulsion
example
but
was
told
not
to
use
it
my
question
does
anyone
know
if
this
security
is
due
to
sdio
protecting
national
security
or
md
protecting
their
own
interests
the
second
example
was
reentry
simulation
from
orbit
to
just
before
the
pitch
up
maneuver
the
biggest
constraint
in
this
one
is
aerodynamic
heating
and
the
parameter
they
were
trying
to
maximize
was
crossrange
he
showed
graphs
of
heating
using
two
different
models
to
show
that
both
were
very
similar
and
i
think
we
were
supposed
to
assume
that
this
meant
they
were
very
accurate
the
end
result
was
that
for
a
polar
orbit
landing
at
ksc
the
dcy
would
have
about
degrees
of
crossrange
and
would
start
its
reentry
profile
about
degrees
south
latitude
i
would
have
asked
about
the
landing
maneuvers
but
he
didnt
know
about
that
aspect
of
the
flight
profile
josh
hopkins
find
a
way
