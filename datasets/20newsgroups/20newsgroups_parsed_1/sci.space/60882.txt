dspse
was
why
clementine
the
sdio
has
contracted
with
the
nrl
naval
research
laboratory
to
fly
the
clementine
mission
btw
we
call
it
dspse
deep
space
project
science
experiment
the
nrl
is
building
the
spacecraft
designing
the
detailed
mission
and
doing
the
integration
and
operations
with
help
from
jpl
goddard
prob
some
folks
i
have
left
outdont
be
mad
i
am
on
the
tamp
trajectory
analysis
mission
planning
team
and
am
responsable
for
the
ivv
of
the
traj
that
goddardcsc
are
designing
as
for
why
sdio
is
doing
it
some
of
the
reasons
are
the
safety
constraints
are
too
tight
to
try
to
run
the
lidar
in
leo
in
leo
we
dont
get
any
new
radiation
data
on
the
sensors
we
will
get
that
data
on
our
passages
through
the
van
allen
sp
belts
since
we
are
going
out
therewhy
not
piggyback
some
general
science
the
intercept
problem
is
a
lot
easied
over
long
distances
and
long
times
i
am
sure
there
are
some
things
i
have
forgotten
and
some
i
havent
been
told
but
those
are
the
reasons
we
all
talk
about
