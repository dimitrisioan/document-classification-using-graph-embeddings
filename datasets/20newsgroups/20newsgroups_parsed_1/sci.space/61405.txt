the
problem
with
oort
cloud
sources
is
that
absolutely
no
plausible
mechanism
has
been
proposed
it
would
have
to
involve
new
physics
as
far
as
i
can
tell
closest
to
conventional
oort
sources
is
a
model
of
bfield
pinching
by
comets
its
got
too
many
holes
in
it
to
count
but
at
least
it
was
a
good
try
so
you
have
a
plausible
model
for
grbs
at
astronomical
distances
i
dont
have
any
plausible
models
for
grbs
at
any
distances
recent
observations
have
just
about
ruled
out
the
merging
neutron
star
hypothesis
which
had
a
lot
of
problems
anyhow
we
have
to
look
for
implausible
models
and
what
is
fundamentally
allowed
independent
of
models
hmm
the
superbowl
burst
has
been
claimed
in
press
releases
to
cast
doubt
on
the
merging
ns
hypothesis
from
what
ive
read
and
i
havent
seen
the
papers
only
the
press
id
say
it
is
consistent
with
some
of
the
merging
ns
models
a
paper
on
the
possibility
of
grbs
in
the
oort
cloud
just
came
through
the
astrophysics
abstract
service
to
get
a
copy
of
this
here
is
the
abstract
of
that
paper
indicator
to
these
events
all
possible
sources
which
are
isotropically
distributed
should
remain
under
consideration
this
is
why
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
is
kept
on
the
list
although
there
is
no
known
mechanism
for
generating
grbs
from
cometary
nuclei
unlikely
as
it
may
seem
the
possibility
that
grbs
originate
in
the
solar
cometary
cloud
can
not
be
excluded
until
it
is
disproved
this
does
not
propose
a
mechanism
for
grbs
in
the
oort
and
no
antimatter
annihilation
does
not
fit
the
spectra
at
least
as
far
as
i
understand
annihilation
spectra
big
difference
thats
ignoring
the
question
of
how
you
fit
a
distribution
to
the
oort
distribution
when
the
oort
distribution
is
not
well
known
in
particular
comet
aphelia
which
are
not
well
known
are
not
a
good
measure
of
the
oort
cloud
distribution
