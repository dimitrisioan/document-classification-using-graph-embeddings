whats
new
in
my
opinion
friday
april
washington
dc
space
billboards
is
this
one
the
spinoffs
we
were
promised
what
about
light
pollution
in
observations
i
read
somewhere
else
that
it
might
even
be
visible
during
the
day
leave
alone
at
night
is
nasa
really
supporting
this
junk
are
protesting
groups
being
organized
in
the
states
really
really
depressed
enzo
i
wouldnt
worry
about
it
theres
enough
space
debris
up
there
that
a
milelong
inflatable
would
probably
deflate
in
some
very
short
period
of
time
less
than
a
year
while
cleaning
up
leo
somewhat
sort
of
a
giant
flypaper
in
orbit
hmm
that
could
actually
be
useful
as
for
advertising
sure
why
not
a
nasa
friend
and
i
spent
one
drunken
night
figuring
out
just
exactly
how
much
gold
mylar
wed
need
to
put
the
golden
arches
of
a
certain
american
fast
food
organization
on
the
face
of
the
moon
fortunately
we
sobered
up
in
the
morning
