introduction
this
series
of
linked
messages
is
periodically
posted
to
the
usenet
groups
scispace
and
sciastro
in
an
attempt
to
provide
good
answers
to
frequently
asked
questions
and
other
reference
material
which
is
worth
preserving
if
you
have
corrections
or
answers
to
other
frequently
asked
questions
that
you
would
like
included
in
this
posting
send

if
you
dont

add
frequently
asked
questions
to
your
kill
file
for
this
group
if
youre
not
reading
this
with
a
newsreader
that
can
kill
articles
by
subject
youre
out
of
luck
the
faq
volume
is
excessive
right
now
and
will
hopefully
be
trimmed
down
by
rewriting
and
condensing
over
time
the
faq
postings
are
available
in
the
ames
space
archive
in
faqfaq
good
summaries
will
be
accepted
in
place
of
the
answers
given
here
the
point
of
this
is
to
circulate
existing
information
and
avoid
rehashing
old
answers
better
to
build
on
top
than
start
again
nothing
more
depressing
than
rehashing
old
topics
for
the
th
time
references
are
provided
because
they
give
more
complete
information
than
any
short
generalization
questions
fall
into
three
basic
types
where
do
i
find
some
information
about
space
try
your
local
public
library
first
the
net
is
not
a
good
place
to
ask
for
general
information
ask
individuals
by
email
if
you
must
there
are
other
sources
use
them
too
the
net
is
a
place
for
open
ended
discussion
i
have
an
idea
which
would
improve
space
flight
hope
you
arent
surprised
but
out
of
have
usually
been
thought
of
before
