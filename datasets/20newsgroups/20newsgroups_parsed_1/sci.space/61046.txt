hideous
vision
of
the
future
observers
were
startled
this
spring
when
a
nasa
launch
vehicle
arrived
at
the
pad
with
schwarzenegger
painted
in
huge
block
letters
on
the
this
is
ok
in
my
opinion
as
long
as
the
stuff
returns
to
earth
what
do
you
think
of
this
revolting
and
hideous
attempt
to
vandalize
the
night
sky
it
is
not
even
april
anymore
if
this
turns
out
to
be
true
its
time
to
get
seriously
active
in
terrorism
this
is
unbelievable
who
do
those
people
think
they
are
selling
every
bit
that
promises
to
make
money
i
guess
we
really
deserve
being
wiped
out
by
uv
radiation
folks
stupidity
wins
i
guess
thats
true
and
if
only
by
pure
numbers
another
depressed
planetary
citizen
hoover
this
isnt
inherently
bad
this
isnt
really
light
pollution
since
it
will
only
be
visible
shortly
before
or
after
dusk
or
during
the
day
of
course
if
night
only
lasts
hours
for
you
youre
probably
going
to
be
inconvienenced
but
youre
inconvienenced
anyway
in
that
case
finally
this
isnt
the
bronze
age
and
most
of
us
arent
indo
european
those
people
speaking
indoeurpoean
languages
often
have
much
nonindoeuropean
ancestry
and
cultural
background
so
please
try
to
remember
that
there
are
more
human
activities
than
those
practiced
by
the
warrior
caste
the
farming
caste
and
the
priesthood
and
why
act
distressed
that
someones
found
a
way
to
do
research
that
doesnt
involve
socialism
it
certianly
doesnt
mean
we
deserve
to
die
phil
fraering
seems
like
every
day
we
find
out
all
sorts
of
stuff
how
the
ancient
mayans
had
televison
repo
man
