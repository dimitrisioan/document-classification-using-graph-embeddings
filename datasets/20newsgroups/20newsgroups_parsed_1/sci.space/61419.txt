alsoif
they
did
come
from
the
oort
cloud
we
would
expect
to
see
the
same
from
other
stars
oort
clouds
thats
a
very
good
point
perhaps
none
of
the
nearby
stars
have
oort
clouds
alphacentauri
is
a
multiplestar
system
you
wouldnt
expect
an
oort
cloud
in
it
sure
about
that
maybe
proxima
might
cause
problems
but
at
oort
cloud
distances
ac
a
and
ac
b
together
look
like
a
point
source
besides
even
the
solar
systems
oort
cloud
is
unstable
over
geologic
time
right
and
needs
to
be
replentished
from
somewhere
else
like
the
short
period
comets
of
the
kupier
belt
or
maybe
im
misremembering
something
i
read
or
heard
somewhere
whats
the
nearest
singlestar
that
is
likely
to
have
a
planetary
system
until
were
able
to
perform
a
broadband
survey
of
nearby
stars
to
detect
planets
we
wont
know
enough
to
say
whether
or
not
a
single
star
has
planets
and
were
likely
to
find
out
about
the
close
ones
first
heck
if
neutron
stars
can
have
planets
anything
can
have
planets
or
was
that
discovery
disconfirmed
phil
fraering
seems
like
every
day
we
find
out
all
sorts
of
stuff
how
the
ancient
mayans
had
