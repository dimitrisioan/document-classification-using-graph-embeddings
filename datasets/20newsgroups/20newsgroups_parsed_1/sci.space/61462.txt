it
said
that
in
the
s
they
developed
a
rocket
that
used
ions
or
nuclear
particles
for
propolsion
the
government
however
didnt
give
them
billion
for
the
developement
id
guess
this
was
a
garbled
report
of
the
nerva
effort
to
develop
a
solidcore
fission
rocket
the
most
mundane
type
of
nuclear
rocket
that
was
the
only
advancedpropulsion
project
that
was
done
on
a
large
enough
scale
to
be
likely
to
attract
news
attention
it
could
be
any
number
of
things
the
description
given
is
awfully
vague
but
id
put
a
small
bet
on
nerva
svr
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
