re
electrical
spacecraft
via
magnetic
field
of
earth
in
article
writes
okay
the
earth
has
a
magnetic
field
if
you
put
a
object
in
the
earth
magnetic
field
it
produces
electricty
well
its
not
that
simple
youre
in
earths
magnetic
field
and
you
dont
generate
electricity
but
it
can
be
done
now
the
question
can
you
use
electricity
to
power
a
spacelow
earth
orbit
vehicle
and
i
fyou
can
can
you
use
the
magnetic
field
of
the
earth
to
power
it
the
way
you
power
things
is
with
electricity
so
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
definitely
yes
if
you
meant
to
say
propel
rather
than
power
the
answer
is
sort
of
yes
you
can
use
interaction
with
the
earths
magnetic
field
to
get
electrical
power
and
there
are
potential
applications
for
this
however
bear
in
mind
that
there
is
no
free
lunch
the
energy
isnt
coming
from
nowhere
what
such
systems
do
is
convert
some
of
the
energy
of
your
orbital
velocity
into
electrical
energy
there
are
cases
where
this
is
a
useful
tradeoff
using
power
obtained
in
this
way
for
propulsion
is
useful
only
in
special
situations
however
what
you
can
do
is
get
your
power
by
some
other
means
eg
solar
arrays
and
run
the
interaction
with
the
magnetic
field
in
reverse
pumping
energy
into
the
orbit
rather
than
taking
energy
out
of
it
if
you
want
more
information
trying
looking
up
electrodynamic
propulsion
tether
applications
and
magsails
can
the
idea
of
a
dragless
satellite
be
used
in
part
to
create
the
electrical
field
no
a
dragless
satellite
does
not
magically
have
no
drag
it
burns
fuel
constantly
to
fight
drag
maintaining
the
exact
orbit
it
would
have
if
there
was
no
drag
this
is
why
there
are
quotes
around
dragless
svr
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
