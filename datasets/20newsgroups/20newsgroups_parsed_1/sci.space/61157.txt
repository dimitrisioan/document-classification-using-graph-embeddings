status
report
april
the
magellan
spacecraft
continues
to
operate
normally
gathering
gravity
data
to
plot
the
density
variations
of
venus
in
the
midlatitudes
the
solar
panel
offpoint
was
returned
to
zero
degrees
and
spacecraft
temperatures
dropped
degrees
c
an
endtoend
test
of
the
delayed
aerobraking
data
readout
process
was
conducted
this
week
in
preparation
for
the
transition
experiment
there
was
some
difficulty
locking
up
to
the
data
frames
and
engineers
are
presently
checking
whether
the
problem
was
in
equipment
at
the
tracking
station
magellan
has
completed
orbits
of
venus
and
is
now
days
from
the
end
of
cycle
and
the
start
of
the
transition
experiment
magellan
scientists
were
participating
in
the
brownvernadsky
microsymposium
at
brown
university
in
providence
ri
this
week
this
joint
meeting
of
us
and
russian
venus
researchers
has
been
continuing
for
many
years
a
threeday
simulation
of
transition
experiment
aerobraking
activities
is
planned
for
next
week
including
