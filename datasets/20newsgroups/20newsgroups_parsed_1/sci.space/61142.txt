hello
i
am
looking
for
a
program
or
algorithm
that
can
be
used
to
compute
sunrise
and
sunset
times
i
would
appreciate
any
advice
i
once
thought
it
would
be
easiest
fitting
a
sine
to
the
times
but
not
this
gave
discrepancy
of
upto
six
minutes
if
you
fit
a
sine
series
youll
get
a
very
good
fit
after
just
three
or
four
terms
though
this
presumably
has
to
do
with
the
eccentricity
of
the
earths
orbit
