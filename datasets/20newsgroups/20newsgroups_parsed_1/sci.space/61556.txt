there
are
a
number
of

small

especially
the

the

would
be
bigger
also
budget

effeciencies
may
cut

the
basic
problems
with

remain
in

i
think
had
nasa
locked
onto
this
design
back
in
with
scarring
to
support
a
truss
for
real
expandability
wed
be
looking
at
a
flying
space
station
this
looks
the
most
realistic
to
me
imho
but
i
dont
know
if
there
is
enough
will
power
to
toss
the
cdrd
existing
hardware
and
then
take
a
rd
power
cut
and
do
it
this
way
the
core
launch
station
has
a
lot
of
positive
ideas
you
could
stick
in
more
hatches
for
experimental
concept
modules
like
the

or
inflatable
