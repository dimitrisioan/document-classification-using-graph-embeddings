a
noop
command
was
sent
to
reset
the
command
loss
timer
this
activity
is
regularly
reported
in
rons
interesting
posts
could
someone
explain
what
the
command
loss
timer
is
if
im
not
mistaken
this
is
the
usual
sort
of
precaution
against
loss
of
communications
that
timer
is
counting
down
continuously
if
it
ever
hits
zero
that
means
galileo
hasnt
heard
from
earth
in
a
suspiciously
long
time
and
it
may
be
galileos
fault
so
its
time
to
go
into
a
fallback
mode
that
minimizes
chances
of
spacecraft
damage
and
maximizes
chances
of
restoring
contact
i
dont
know
exactly
whatall
galileo
does
in
such
a
situation
but
a
common
example
is
to
switch
receivers
on
the
theory
that
maybe
the
one
youre
listening
with
has
died
all
work
is
