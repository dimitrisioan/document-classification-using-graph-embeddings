this
prize
isnt
big

it
is

if
the

exists
actually
there
are
people
who
will
tell
you
that
it
would
be
enough
to
do
ssto
development
if
done
privately
as
a

operation
of
course
they
may
be
overoptimistic
you
can
also
assume
that
a
working
ssto
would
have
other
applications
that
would
help
pay
for
its
development
costs
id
be
inclined
to
make
the
prize
somewhat
larger

g
might
be
enough
all
