writes
other
idea
for
old
space
crafts
is
as
navigation
beacons
and
such
why
not
if
you
can
put
them
on
safe
pause
mode
why
not
have
them
be
activated
by
a
signal
from
a
space
craft
manned
to
act
as
a
naviagtion
beacon
to
take
a
directional
plot
on
wierd
or
what

not
high
just
jacked
there
is
a
whole
constellation
of
custom
built
navigation
beacon
satellites
in
the
process
of
being
phased
out
right
now
the
transitoscar
satellites
are
being
replaced
by
gps
or
were
you
thinking
of
deep
space
navigation
which
is
best
done
with
dopplervlbi
stellar
measurements
i
do
not
think
additional
radio
beacons
would
help
much
