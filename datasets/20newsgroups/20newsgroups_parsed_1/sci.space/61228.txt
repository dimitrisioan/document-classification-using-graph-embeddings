answer
to
a
question
from
hawking
chahine
described
a
proposed
dragfree
satellite
but
confirmed
that
at
this
point
its
only
a
concept
so
whats
a
drag
free
satellite
coated
with
wd
triad
the
first
dragfree
satellite
was
designed
and
built
by
the
johns
hopkins
applied
physics
laboratory
and
launched
sept
the
satellite
was
in
three
sections
separated
by
two
booms
the
central
section
housed
the
discos
disturbance
compensation
system
which
consisted
of
a
proof
mass
of
special
nonmagnetic
alloy
housed
within
a
spherical
cavity
the
proof
mass
flew
a
true
gravitational
orbit
free
from
drag
and
radiation
pressure
teflon
microthrusters
kept
the
body
of
the
satellite
centered
around
the
proof
mass
thereby
flying
the
entire
satellite
drag
free
triad
was
one
of
the
apldesigned
navy
navigation
satellites
the
ndgeneration
operational
navigation
satellites
flying
today
nova
use
a
singleaxis
version
of
discos
triad
was
also
the
sixth
apl
satellite
to
be
powered
by
an
rtg
apl
flew
the
first
nuclear
power
supply
in
space
