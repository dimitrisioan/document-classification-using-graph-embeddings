to
say
that
visible
light
astronomy
is
already
a
dying
field
is
pure
hokum
to
use
the
logic
that
things
are
already
bad
so
it
doesnt
matter
if
it
gets
worse
is
absurd
maybe
common
sense

logic

ok
so
those
scientists
can
get
around
the
atmosphere
with
fancy
computer
algorythims
but
have
you
looked
ad
the
hubble
results
the
defects
of
the
mirror
are
partially
correctable
with
software
see
those
jupiter
pictures
for
results
but
is
the
effects
are
completely
reversable
why
is
there
going
to
be
a
shuttle
mission
to
fix
it
the
way
i
see
it
and
please
astromomers
give
me
a
swift
netkick
in
the
butt
if
im
out
of
the
ball
park
the
astromers
are
making
the
best
of
limited
possiblities
theres
only
one
hubble
and
the
shuttle
makes
another
in
the
near
future
a
nonthought
perhaps
those
self
same
billboards
could
have
small
optical
receptors
of
a
limited
kind
mounted
on
the
reverse
sides
of
the
mirrors
if
that
is
what
is
used
and
then
the
whole
thing
becomes
a
giant
array
telescope
polar
caps
or
student
konsultant
making
the
world
safe
for
computing
never
before
have
we
owed
so
little
to
so
many
rtfolk
one
must
not
confuse
