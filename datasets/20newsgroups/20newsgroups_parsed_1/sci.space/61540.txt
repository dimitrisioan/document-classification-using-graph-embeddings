the

in
a
pinch
indeed
this
dictated
a
rather
odd
design
for
the
solar
arrays
since
they
had
to
be
retractable
as
well
as
extendable
and
may
thus
have
indirectly
contributed
to
the

problems
why
not
design
the
solar
arrays
to
be
detachable
if
the
shuttle
is
going
to
retunr
the
hst
what
bother
are
some
arrays
just
fit
them
with
a
quick
release
i
didnt
think
the
bistem
design
was
used
so
much
for
the
retrieval
as
for
the
ability
to
launch
in
a
tight
size
sts
envelope
this
is
my
own
guess
based
on
similar
designs
flown
on
other
large
stslaunched
sc
gro
uars
also
there
might
be
some
consideration
given
to
mass
requirements
bistems

finally
the

arrays
do
have
the
ability
to

theyre
going
to
be
replaced
with
new
arrays
however
as
an
acs
guy
whos
seen
his
branch
management
pull
their
collective
hair
out
over
hst
i
would
voice
a
hearty
yea
to
using
conventional
arrays
over
bistems
whenever
possible
no

no
