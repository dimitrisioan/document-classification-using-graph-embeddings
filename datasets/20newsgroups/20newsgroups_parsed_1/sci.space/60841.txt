reading
from

amoco
performance
products
data
sheet
their
erl
resin
with
t
carbon
fiber
reinforcement
has
a
compressive
strength
of
psi
it
has
a
density
of
lbcu
in
therefore
the
theoretical
height
for
a
constant
section
column
that
can
just
support
itself
is
million
inches
or
ft
or
statute
miles
now
a
real
structure
will
have
horizontal
bracing
either
a
truss
type
or
guy
wires
or
both
and
will
be
used
below
the
crush
strength
let
us
assume
that
we
will
operate
at
of
the
theoretical
strength
this
gives
a
working
height
of
miles
for
a
constant
section
column
a
constant
section
column
is
not
the
limit
on
how
high
you
can
build
something
if
you
allow
a
tapering
of
the
cross
section
as
you
go
up
for
example
let
us
say
you
have
a
pound
load
to
support
at
the
top
of
the
tower
for
simplicity
in
calculation
this
requires
square
inches
of
column
cross
sectional
area
to
support
the
weight
the
mile
of
structure
below
the
payload
will
itself
weigh
lb
so
at
mile
below
the
payload
the
total
load
is
now
lb
a
increase
the
next
mile
of
structure
must
be
thicker
in
cross
section
to
support
the
top
mile
of
tower
plus
the
payload
each
mile
of
structure
must
increase
in
area
by
the
same
ratio
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
we
can
see
from
this
that
there
is
no
theoretical
limit
on
area
although
there
will
be
practical
limits
based
on
how
much
composites
we
can
afford
to
by
at
lb
and
how
much
load
you
need
to
support
on
the
ground
for
which
you
need
a
foundation
that
the
bedrock
can
support
let
us
arbitrarily
choose
billion
as
the
limit
in
costruction
cost
with
this
we
can
afford
perhaps
lb
of
composites
assuming
our
finished
structure
costs
lb
the
lb
figure
is
just
for
materials
cost
then
we
have
a
towerpayload
mass
ratio
of
at
a
mass
ratio
per
mile
the
tower
height
becomes
miles
this
is
clearly
above
the
significant
atmosphere
a
rocket
launched
from
the
top
of
the
tower
will
still
have
to
provide
orbital
velocity
but
atmospheric
drag
and
glosses
will
be
almost
eliminated
glosses
are
the
component
of
rocket
thrust
in
the
vertical
direction
to
counter
gravity
but
which
do
not
contribute
to
horizontal
orbital
velocity
thus
they
represent
wasted
thrust
together
with
drag
rockets
starting
from
the
ground
have
a
velocity
penalty
to
contend
with
this
analysis
is
simplified
in
that
it
does
not
consider
wind
loads
these
will
require
more
structural
support
over
the
first
miles
of
height
above
that
the
air
pressure
drops
to
a
low
enough
value
for
it
not
to
be
a
big
factor
