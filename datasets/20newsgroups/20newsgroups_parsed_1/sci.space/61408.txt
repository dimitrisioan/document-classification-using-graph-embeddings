if
you
are
familiar
with
the
software
work
that
received
the
level
rating
could
you
post
a
description
of
it
andor
some
references
i
think
many
people
would
be
interested
to
know
just
what
the
ibm
team
on
that
effort
is
doing
differently
from
most
other
organizationsprojects
that
earned
them
that
rating
i
am
familiar
with
the
project
it
is
the
onboard
shuttle
flight
software
project
this
software
controls
the
space
shuttle
during
all
dynamic
phases
as
well
as
onorbit
it
has
ultrahigh
reliability
and
extremely
low
error
rates
there
have
been
several
papers
published
on
the
subject
and
ill
collect
some
references
there
may
be
an
article
in
the
ibm
systems
journal
late
early
there
is
no
magic
formula
we
did
it
with
dedicated
and
disciplined
folks
who
worked
to
put
together
a
process
that
finds
and
removes
errors
and
is
corrected
based
on
errors
that
escape
we
present
a
one
day
overview
of
our
process
periodically
to
interested
folks
the
next
one
is
may
th
in
washington
dc
i
can
fax
specifics
to
those
who
are
interested
