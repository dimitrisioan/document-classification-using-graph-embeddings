one
could
go
on
and
on
and
on
here
but
i
wonder
how
many
people
read
scispace
and
of
what
powerinfluence
are
these
individuals
quick
everyone
who
sees
this
post
a
reply
that
says
hey
i
read
scispace
then
we
can
count
them
and
find
out
how
many
there
are
this
will
also
help
answer
that
nagging
question
just
what
is
the
maximum
bandwidth
of
the
internet
anyways
a
practical
suggestion
to
be
sure
but
one
could
also
peek
into
newslists
where
brian
reid
has
posted
usenet
readership
report
for
mar
another
posting
called
usenet
readership
summary
report
for
mar
gives
the
methodology
and
caveats
of
reids
survey
these
postings
failed
to
appear
for
a
while
i
wonder
why
but
they
are
now
back
reid
alas
gives
us
no
measure
of
the
