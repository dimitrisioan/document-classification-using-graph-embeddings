so
how
close
would
the
comet
have
gotten
to
jupiter
on
the
pass
that
put
it
into
temporary
orbit
and
how
far
is
it
likely
to
get
from
jupiter
before
it
makes
its
escape
the
answer
to
all
of
these
questions
is
we
dont
know
yet
we
dont
know
for
sure
if
the
comet
is
in
a
temporary
orbit
i
see
i
wasnt
so
interested
in
this
particular
case
as
in
typical
behavior
anyway
can
these
questions
be
answered
for
a
previous
instance
such
as
the
gehrels
that
was
mentioned
in
an
earlier
posting
gehrels
was
in
a
temporary
jovian
orbit
for
about
or
years
ill
get
the
orbital
elements
from
dance
of
the
planets
and
post
them
here
sorry
folks
i
should
have
done
this
and
meant
to
just
after
i
hit
the
send
key
orbital
elements
of
comet
vii
from
dance
files
pau
e
i
capomega
w
epoch
also
perihelions
of
gehrels
were
april
jupiter
radii
august
jupiter
radii
hope
this
helpsim
even
less
of
an
orbital
mechanic
than
i
