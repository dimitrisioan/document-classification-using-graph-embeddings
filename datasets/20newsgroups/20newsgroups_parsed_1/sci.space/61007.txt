what
is
the
deal
with
life
on
mars
i
save
the
face
and
heard
associated
theories
which
sound
thin
to
me
the
face
is
an
accident
of
light
and
shadow
there
are
many
faces
in
landforms
on
earth
none
is
artificial
well
excluding
mount
rushmore
and
the
like
there
is
also
a
smiley
face
on
mars
and
a
kermit
the
frog
the
question
of
life
in
a
more
mundane
sense
bacteria
or
the
like
is
not
quite
closed
although
the
odds
are
against
it
and
the
most
that
the
more
orthodox
exobiologists
are
hoping
for
now
is
fossils
there
are
currently
no
particular
plans
to
do
any
further
searches
for
life
are
we
going
back
to
mars
to
look
at
this
face
agian
mars
observer
currently
approaching
mars
will
probably
try
to
get
a
better
image
or
two
of
the
face
at
some
point
its
not
high
priority
nobody
takes
it
very
seriously
the
shadowed
half
of
the
face
does
not
look
very
facelike
so
all
it
will
take
is
one
shot
at
a
different
sun
angle
to
ruin
the
illusion
all
work
is
one
mans
