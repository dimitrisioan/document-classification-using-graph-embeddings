sez
given
that
ive
heard
the
shuttle
software
rated
as
level
in
maturity
i
strongly
doubt
that
this
having
lots
of
bugs
is
the
case
level
out
of
how
many
what
are
the
different
levels
ive
never
heard
of
this
rating
system
anyone
care
to
clue
me
in
sei
level
the
highest
level
the
sei
stands
for
software
engineering
institute
im
not
sure
but
i
believe
that
this
rating
only
applies
to
the
flight
software
also
keep
in
mind
that
it
was
not
achieved
through
the
use
of
sophisticated
tools
but
rather
through
a
brute
force
and
ignorance
attack
on
the
problem
during
the
challenger
standdown
they
simply
threw
hundreds
of
people
at
it
and
did
the
whole
process
by
hand
i
would
not
consider
receiving
a
warning
status
on
systems
which
are
not
yet
in
use
would
detract
much
if
anything
from
such
a
rating
ill
have
to
get
the
latest
copy
of
the
guidelines
to
make
sure
they
just
issued
new
ones
i
think
also
keep
in
mind
that
the
sei
levels
are
concerned
primarily
with
control
of
the
software
process
the
assumption
is
that
a
well
controlled
process
will
produce
good
software
also
keep
in
mind
that
sei
level
is
damned
hard
most
software
in
this
country
is
produced
by
engineering
practicies
that
only
rate
an
sei
level
if
that
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
