re
over
zealous
shuttle
critics
weve
had
the
the
great
western
the
dunno
and
the
great
northern
postulated
as
brunels
masterpiece
keep
boxing
the
compass
chaps
youll
get
round
to
it
eventually
the
great
western
was
a
highly
successful
transatlantic
mail
ship
with
hybrid
sail
and
steam
propulsion
the
great
eastern
which
broke
the
little
giant
financially
and
otherwise
was
a
revolutionary
leap
forward
in
ship
design
a
thirty
thousand
ton
all
steel
vessel
with
primary
steam
propulsion
it
was
at
the
time
easily
the
biggest
ocean
going
vessel
ever
built
brunel
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
cargo
and
or
fuel
capacity
rose
with
the
cube
of
scale
while
drag
rose
with
the
square
so
a
really
big
ship
could
steam
thousands
of
miles
without
coaling
unfortunately
there
was
no
real
market
for
such
a
beast
at
the
time
and
it
was
eventually
sold
off
at
scrap
values
as
another
poster
said
it
then
went
on
to
a
successful
career
as
a
telegraph
cable
laying
ship
it
was
in
fact
the
only
ship
of
its
day
capable
of
laying
a
transatlantic
cable
in
one
go
with
the
endurance
and
capacity
to
carry
the
huge
reel
all
the
way
and
the
manoeuverabilty
to
dredge
for
defective
sections
see
arthur
c
clarkes
book
how
the
world
was
one
i
think
thats
right
if
thats
how
the
shuttle
goes
down
in
history
as
a
technical
triumph
and
a
financial
disaster
for
the
builder
it
would
not
be
entirely
ignoble
but
i
doubt
if
history
will
be
so
charitable
its
true
the
shuttle
can
do
things
no
other
launch
system
can
do
but
are
they
worth
doing
with
low
cost
access
to
space
you
could
have
an
affordable
space
station
for
doing
shuttlelike
extended
manned
missions
as
it
is
the
shuttle
is
not
so
much
a
spacetruck
as
a
spacerv
only
not
so
cheap
to
run
