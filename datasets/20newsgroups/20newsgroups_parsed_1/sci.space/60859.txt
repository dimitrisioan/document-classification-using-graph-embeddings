subject
a
flawed
propulsion
system
space
shuttle
for
an
essay
i
am
writing
about
the
space
shuttle
and
a
need
for
a
better
propulsion
system
through
research
i
have
found
that
it
is
rather
clumsy
ie
all
the
checkstests
before
launch
the
safety
hazards
sitting
on
a
hydrogen
bomb
etc
if
you
have
any
beefs
about
the
current
space
shuttle
program
re
propulsion
please
send
me
your
ideas
thanks
a
lot
