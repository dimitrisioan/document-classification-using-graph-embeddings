the
single
launch
core
station
concept
a
shuttle
external
tank
and
solid
rocket
boosters
would
be
used
to
launch
the
station
into
orbit
shuttle
main
engines
would
be
mounted
to
the
tail
of
the
station
module
for
launch
and
jettisoned
after
et
separation

replied
why
jettison
the
ssmes
why
not
hold
on
to
them
and
have
a
shuttle
bring
them
down
to
use
as
spares
one
performance
reason
comes
to
mind
if
you
jettison
the
ssmes
you
dont
have
to
drag
them
with
you
when
you
perform
your
circularization
burns
onorbit
ssmes
are
just
dead
weight
since
we
dont
have
an
ssme
ho
pressurization
mechanism
which
works
in
zerog
this
means
that
you
cant
use
them
for
reboost
or
anything
else
dead
weight
has
a
couple
of
advantages
but
more
disadvantages
throwaway
ssmes
might
let
us
use
some
of
the
old
ssmes
which
are
not
quitemanratable
but
i
doubt
wed
do
that
the
cost
of
a
launch
failure
is
too
high
