i
remeber
reading
the
comment
that
general
dynamics
was
tied
into
this
in
connection
with
their
proposal
for
an
early
manned
landing
the
general
chairman
is
paul
bialla
who
is
some
official
of
general
dynamics
the
emphasis
seems
to
be
on
a
scaleddown
fast
plan
to
put
people
on
the
moon
in
an
impoverished
spaceflightfunding
climate
youd
think
it
would
be
a
golden
opportunity
to
do
lots
of
precusor
work
for
modest
money
using
an
agressive
series
of
robot
spacecraft
but
theres
not
a
hint
of
this
in
the
brochure
it
may
be
that
they
just
didnt
mention
it
or
that
they
actually
havent
thought
about
it
i
got
the
vague
impression
from
their
mission
proposal
that
they
werent
taking
a
very
holistic
aproach
to
the
whole
thing
they
seemed
to
want
to
land
people
on
the
moon
by
the
end
of
the
decade
without
explaining
why
or
what
they
would
do
once
they
got
there
the
only
application
i
remember
from
the
av
week
article
was
placing
a
telescope
on
the
moon
thats
great
but
they
dont
explain
why
it
cant
be
done
robotically
hrumph
they
didnt
send
me
anything
youre
not
hanging
out
with
the
right
people
apparently
but
im
a
member
besides
bill
i
hang
out
with
you
josh
hopkins
find
a
way
or
make
one
attributed
to
hannibal
