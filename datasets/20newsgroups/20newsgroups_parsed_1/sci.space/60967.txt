why
paul
its
obvious
once
chlorine
chemistry
has
been
banned
on
earth
as
is
being
advocated
by
some
groups
ti
prices
will
sharply
increase
we
are
of
course
not
allowed
to
assume
any
developments
in
ti
processing
lunar
ti
will
then
be
eminently
competitive
for
the
trendy
jewelry
market
and
certain
applications
of
national
importance
well
there
already
is
a
sulfate
process
for
tio
purification
the
chlorine
process
is
cleaner
however
and
for
that
reason
is
achieving
dominance
in
the
marketplace
most
ti
is
used
in
pigment
btw
as
the
oxide
where
it
replaced
white
lead
pigment
some
decades
ago
very
little
is
reduced
to
the
metal
seriously
id
say
there
is
a
flaw
in
garys
analysis
in
that
he
assumes
an
export
oriented
economy
maybe
the
lunatics
will
just
want
some
native
ti
for
local
use
which
merely
evades
the
issue
of
why
those
lunatics
are
there
at
all
and
why
their
children
would
want
to
stay
