re
nuclear
waste
in
pat
writes
on
the
issue
of
burning
nuclear
wastes
using
particle
beams
how
is
it
ever
going
to
be
an
off
the
shelf
technology
if
someone
doesnt
do
it
maybe
we
should
do
this
as
part
of
the
ssf
design
goals
gee
fred
after
your
bitter
defense
of
khz
power
as
a
basic
technology
for
ssf
id
think
you
would
support
a
minor
research
program
like
this
i
sometimes
wonder
if
your
newsfeed
gives
you
different
articles
than
everyone
else
pat
just
a
few
corrections
i
never
defended
khz
power
other
than
as
something
reasonable
to
go
look
at
i
have
also
never
opposed
a
research
project
into
feasibility
of
the
spalling
reactor
approach
to
cleaning
nuclear
waste
i
simply
doubt
it
could
be
made
to
work
in
the
real
world
tm
which
ought
to
become
clear
fairly
quickly
during
a
research
program
into
feasibility
sort
of
like
what
happened
to
khz
power
it
proved
to
have
a
downside
that
was
too
expensive
to
overcome
i
figure
things
wrong
in
a
single
sentence
is
a
high
enough
fault
density
for
even
you
pat
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
