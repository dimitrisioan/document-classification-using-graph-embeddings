writes
later
on
the
andersons
tried
to
shed
their
reputation
as
creators
of
some
of
the
worst
pseudoscientific
shows
in
tv
history
by
flying
into
infinity
this
was
a
oneoff
thing
done
as
part
of
bbcs
educational
sf
series
the
day
after
tomorrow
the
anderson
episode
dealt
with
a
spaceship
capable
of
reaching
the
speed
of
light
lightship
altares
the
fourman
crew
eventually
journeyed
into
a
black
hole
and
ended
up
on
the
far
side
of
the
galaxy
i
think
i
saw
this
as
a
yearold
back
in
and
liked
it
very
much
but
then
again
i
was
a
fan
of
space
so
i
guess
i
was
easily
satisfied
in
those
days
wow
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
i
had
made
that
up
i
remember
that
movie
it
was
about
hours
long
i
dont
think
they
ended
up
anywhere
in
the
known
universe
i
remember
they
got
a
message
halfway
out
to
proxima
centauri
that
earth
transmitted
a
day
after
they
launched
timed
to
catch
up
with
them
at
the
halfway
point
i
thought
it
was
neat
i
think
i
was
all
of
at
the
time
does
anyone
know
if
into
infinity
has
been
released
on
video
i
have
some
space
shows
on
vhs
and
know
that
thunderbirds
etc
also
are
available
in
england
space
has
just
come
out
with
episodes
released
in
american
stores
i
will
look
for
the
into
infinity
show
i
never
did
know
that
was
the
name
of
it
i
thought
the
show
was
called
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
that
was
it
if
you
blow
fire
against
the
wind
take
care
to
not
get
the
smoke

your
eyes
