dandridge
cole
and
isaac
asimov
collaborated
on
a
book
titled
habitable
planets
for
man
i
think
in
it
should
be
available
in
most
good
libraries
or
through
interlibrary
loan
this
is
the
highschool
science
version
the
original
rand
study
by
stephen
h
dole
planets
for
man
gives
the
harder
numbers
graphs
such
but
predates
michael
harts
later
work
on
continuously
habitable
zones
is
this
still
in
print
or
available
other
than
on
loan
i
remember
reading
this
many
years
ago
and
its
still
the
best
thing
i
remember
in
this
vein
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
