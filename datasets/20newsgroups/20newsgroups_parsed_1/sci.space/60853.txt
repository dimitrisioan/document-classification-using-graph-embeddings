re
what
if
the
ussr
had
reached
the
moon
first
this
is
turning
into
whats
a
moonbase
good
for
and
i
ought
not
to
post
when
ive
a
hundred
some
odd
posts
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
economic
since
someone
with
space
industry
will
presumeably
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industry
eventually
they
will
simply
be
able
to
afford
more
stuff
