if
you
assume
new
launcher
development
with
lower
costs
as
a
specific
objective
then
you
probably
dont
want
to
build
something
hlvsized
anyway
nobody
who
is
interested
in
launching
things
cheaply
will
buy
titans
it
doesnt
take
many
titan
pricetags
to
pay
for
a
laser
launcher
or
a
large
gas
gun
or
a
development
program
for
a
big
dumb
booster
all
of
which
would
have
far
better
costeffectiveness
henry
i
made
the
assumption
that
he
who
gets
there
firstest
with
the
mostest
wins
ohhh
you
want
to
put
in
fine
print
which
says
thou
shall
do
wonderous
rd
rather
than
use
offtheshelf
hardware
sorry
didnt
see
that
in
my
copy
most
of
the
pournellesque
proposals
run
along
the
lines
of
some
dollar
amount
reward
for
some
simple
goal
you
go
ahead
and
do
your
development
ill
buy
off
the
shelf
at
higher
cost
or
even
russian
but
i
also
assume
that
thered
be
some
buy
us
provos
in
there
and
be
camped
out
in
the
moon
while
you
are
launching
and
assembling
little
ittybitty
payloads
in
leo
with
your
laser
or
gas
gun
and
working
out
the
bugs
of
assembly
integration
in
leo
oh
hey
could
i
get
a
couple
of
canadarms
tuned
for
the
lunar
environment
i
wan
na
do
some
teleoperated
prospecting
while
im
up
there
software
engineering
thats
like
military
intelligence
