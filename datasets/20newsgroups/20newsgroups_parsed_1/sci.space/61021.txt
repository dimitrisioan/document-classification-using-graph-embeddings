iapetussaturn
eclipse
forwarded
from
john
spencer
there
will
be
two
eclipses
of
iapetus
by
saturn
and
its
rings
in
may
and
july
please
spread
the
word
heres
some
information
about
the
events
and
then
a
couple
of
messages
from
jay
goguen
of
jpl
appealing
for
thermal
observations
of
the
eclipse
to
learn
more
about
the
thermal
properties
of
iapetus
he
might
also
have
some
money
available
john

iapetus
will
be
eclipsed
by
the
shadows
of
saturns
rings
and
saturn
itself
on
ut
and
again
on

times
could
be
minutes
later
according
to
an
alternate
ephemeris
and
photometric
observations
are
important
for
refining
iapetus
orbit
because
the
suns
size
projected
on
the
rings
as
seen
from
iapetus
is
km
its
unlikely
that
we
will
learn
anything
new
about
the
rings
themselves
from
the
observations
see
soma
astronomy
and
astrophysics

for
more
details
thanks
to
andy
odell
of
northern
arizona
university
for
bringing
the
events
to
my
attention
thermal
observations
jay
goguen
writes
to
me
the
interesting
thing
to
do
would
be
thermal
ir
of
the
july
disappearance
into
the
shadow
of
the
planet
to
measure
thermal
inertia
etc
unfortunately
the
ut
of
this
event
renders
it
inaccessible
except
from
russia
even
from
calar
alto
saturn
is
rising
through
airmasses
at
ut
do
you
know
anyone
in
russia
or
ukraine
with
a
big
telescope
and
um
instrumentation
thats
looking
for
something
to
do
id
be
willing
to
make
a
personal
grant
of
for
the
data
jay
and
again
please
try
to
encourage
anyone
that
can
observe
the
iapetus
planet
disappearance
to
do
so
at
thermal
wavelengths
my
impression
would
be
that
its
not
an
easy
observation
iapetus
will
be
faint
and
getting
fainter
in
eclipse
so
youll
need
a
big
telescope
thats
a
good
ir
telescope
and
reasonable
um
instrumentation
i
dont
think
that
combination
is
widely
available
at
the
longitudes
that
are
well
placed
for
observation
we
need
sofia
for
this
one
one
possibility
would
be
the
ir
telescope
in
india
but
its
only
