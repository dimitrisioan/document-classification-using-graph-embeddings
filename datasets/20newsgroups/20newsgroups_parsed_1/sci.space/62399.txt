times
on

may
th
in
the
week
in
review
section
there
was
a
report
of
a
group
called
space
marketing
in
atlanta
georgia
who
is
planning
to
put
up
a
one
mile
wide
reflective
earth
orbiting
satelite
which
will
appear
as
large
and
as
bright
as
the
moon
and
carry
some
sort
of
advertising
there
was
an
editorial
about
this
in
the
times
the
following
tuesday
are
others
as
upset
about
this
as
i
am
i
feel
that
a
global
boycott
of
anyone
involved
with
such
a
project
would
be
a
good
idea
perhaps
it
could
be
made
illegal
in
various
countries
around
the
world
do
others
agree
