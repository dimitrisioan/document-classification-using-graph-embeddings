no
a
dragless
satellite
does
not
magically
have
no
drag
it
burns
fuel
constantly
to
fight
drag
maintaining
the
exact
orbit
it
would
have
if
there
was
no
drag
well
almost
it
turns
out
that
clever
orbital
mechanics
can
engineer
things
so
that
resonant
interactions
with
the
higher
order
harmonics
of
the
earths
gravitational
field
can
pump
energy
into
a
satellite
and
keep
it
from
experiencing
drag
effects
for
periods
of
months
to
years
a
harmonic
of
the
earths
gravitational
field
what
is
a
harmonic
of
the
earths
gravitational
field
my
favorite
example
of
this
is
the
sovietrussian
heavy
elint
satellites
of
the
cosmos
class
which
are
in
resonance
in
resonance
with
what
its
not
like
theres
any
wavelength
or
frequency
to
the
earths
gravitational
field
now
there
might
be
some
interesting
interactions
with
the
moons
tidal
effectis
that
what
youre
talking
about
this
probably
has
little
relevance
to
space
stations
since
the
degree
orbits
of
the
c
satellites
are
at
km
which
is
unacceptably
far
into
the
inner
van
allen
belt
for
manned
platforms
but
its
kind
of
interesting
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
physics
of
the
situation
what
are
the
physics
of
the
situation
the
only
way
i
can
see
gravitational
effects
being
useful
in
adding
energy
to
an
object
orbiting
earth
is
some
sort
of
interaction
with
the
moon
