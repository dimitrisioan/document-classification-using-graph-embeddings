huntington

calif
on
a

southern
california
day
mcdonnell
douglas
rolled
out
its
dcx
rocket
ship
last
saturday
the
company
hopes
this
singlestage
rocket
technology
demonstrator
will
be
the
first
step
towards
a
singlestagetoorbit
ssto
rocket
ship
the
white
conical
vehicle
was
scheduled
to
go
to
the
white
sands
missile
range
in
new
mexico
this
week
flight
tests
will
start
in
midjune
although
there
wasnt
a
cloud
in
the
noonday
sky
the
forecast
for
ssto
research
remains
cloudy
the
sdi
organization
which
paid
million
for
the
dcx
cant
itself
afford
to
fund
full
development
of
a
followon
vehicle
to
get
the
necessary
hundreds
of
millions
required
for
a
suborbital
dcxa
sdio
is
passing
a
tin
cup
among
its
sister
government
agencies
sdio
originally
funded
ssto
research
as
a
way
to
cut
the
costs
for
orbital
deployments
of
spacebased
sensors
and
weapns
however
recent
changes
in
sdis
political
marching
orders
and
budget
cuts
have
made
ssto
less
of
a
priority
today
the
agency
is
more
interested
in
using
dcx
as
a
step
towards
a
lowcost
reusable
sounding
rocket
sdio
has
already
done
briefings
to
other
government
agencies
said
col
simon
pete
worden
sdios
deputy
for
technology
but
worden
declined
to
say
how
much
the
agencies
would
have
to
pony
up
for
the
program
i
didnt
make
colonel
by
telling
my
contractors
how
much
money
i
have
available
to
spend
he
quipped
at
a
press
conference
at
mcdonnell
douglas
astronautics
headquarters
while
sdio
has
lowered
its
sights
on
the
programs
orbital
objective
agency
officials
hail
the
dcx
as
an
example
of
the
better
faster
cheaper
approach
to
hardware
development
the
agency
believes
this
philosophy
can
produce
breakthroughs
that
leapfrog
ahead
of
evolutionary
technology
developments
worden
said
the
dcx
illustrates
how
a
build
a
little
test
a
little
approach
can
produce
results
on
time
and
within
budget
he
said
the
program
which
went
from
concept
to
hardware
in
around
months
showed
how
todays
engineers
could
move
beyond
the
miracles
of
our
parents
time
the
key
is
management
worden
said
sdio
had
a
very
light
hand
on
this
project
we
had
only
one
overworked
major
jess
sponable
although
the
next
phase
may
involve
more
agencies
worden
said
lean
management
and
a
sense
of
governmentindustry
partnership
will
be
crucial
its
essential
we
do
not
end
up
with
a
large
management
structure
where
the
price
goes
up
exponentially
sdios
approach
also
won
praise
from
two
california
members
of
the
house
science
space
and
technology
committee
this
is
the
direction
were
going
to
have
to
go
said
rep
george
brown
the
committees
democratic
chairman
programs
that
stretch
aout
to
years
arent
sustainablenasa
hasnt
learned
it
yet
sdio
has
rep
dana
rohrbacher
browns
republican
colleague
went
further
joking
that
a
shrimp
is
a
fish
designed
by
a
nasa
design
team
rohrbacher
doubted
that
the
program
ever
would
have
been
completed
if
it
were
left
to
the
civil
space
agency
rohrbacher
whose
orange
county
district
includes
mcdonnell
douglas
also
criticized
nasaair
force
work
on
conventional
multistaged
rockets
as
placing
new
casings
around
old
missile
technology
lets
not
build
fancy
ammunition
with
capsules
on
top
lets
build
a
spaceship
although
rohrbacher
praised
sdios
sponsorship
he
said
the
private
sector
needs
to
take
the
lead
in
developing
ssto
technology
mcdonnell
douglas
which
faces
very
uncertain
prospects
with
its
c
transport
and
space
station
freedom
programs
were
more
cautious
about
a
large
private
secotro
commitment
on
very
large
ventures
companies
put
in
seed
money
said
charles
ordahl
mcdonnell
douglas
senior
vice
president
for
space
systems
you
need
strong
government
investments
while
the
government
and
industry
continue
to
differ
on
funding
for
the
dcxa
they
agree
on
continuing
an
incremental
approach
to
development
citing
corporate
history
they
liken
the
process
to
douglas
aircrafts
dc
aircraft
just
as
two
earlier
aircraft
paved
the
way
for
the
dc
transport
a
gradual
evolution
in
singlestage
rocketry
could
eventually
lead
to
an
orbital
delta
clipper
dc
flight
tests
this
summer
at
white
sands
will
expand
the
envelope
of
performance
with
successive
tests
increasing
speed
and
altitude
the
first
tests
will
reach
feet
and
demonstrate
hovering
verticle
takeoff
and
landing
the
second
series
will
send
the
unmanned
dcx
up
to
feet
the
third
and
final
series
will
take
the
craft
up
to
feet
maneuvers
will
become
more
complex
on
third
phase
the
final
tests
will
include
a
pitchover
manever
that
rotates
the
vehicle
back
into
a
bottomdown
configuration
for
a
soft
fourlegged
landing
the
flight
test
series
will
be
supervised
by
charles
pete
conrad
who
performed
similar
maneuvers
on
the
apollo
moon
landing
now
a
mcdonnell
douglas
vice
president
conrad
paised
the
vehicles
aircraftlike
approach
to
operations
features
include
automated
checkout
and
access
panels
for
easy
maintainance
if
the
program
moves
to
the
next
stage
engine
technology
will
become
a
key
consideration
this
engine
would
have
more
thrust
than
the
pratt
whitney
rla
engines
used
on
the
dcx
each
motor
uses
liquid
hydrogen
and
liquid
oxygen
propellants
to
generate
up
to
pounds
of
thrust
based
on
the
engine
used
in
centaur
upper
stages
the
a
model
has
a
thrust
champer
designed
for
sea
level
operation
and
threetoon
throttling
capability
it
also
is
designed
for
repeat
firings
and
rapid
turnaround
worden
said
future
singlestage
rockets
could
employ
tripropellant
engine
technology
developed
in
the
former
soviet
union
the
resulting
engines
could
burn
a
dense
hydrocarbon
fuel
at
takeoff
and
then
switch
to
liquid
hydrogen
at
higher
altitudes
the
mechanism
for
the
teaming
may
already
be
in
place
pratt
has
a
technology
agreement
with
npo
energomash
the
design
bureau
responsible
for
the
tripropellant
and
energia
cryogenic
engines
