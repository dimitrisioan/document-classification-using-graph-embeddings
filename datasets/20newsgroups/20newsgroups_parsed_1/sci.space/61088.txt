hmmm
i
seem
to
recall
that
the
attraction
of
solid
state
record
players
and
radios
in
the
s
wasnt
better
performance
but
lower
perunit
cost
than
vacuumtube
systems
i
dont
think
so
at
first
but
solid
state
offered
better
reliabity
id
bet
and
any
lower
costs
would
be
only
after
the
processes
really
scaled
up
