re
hst
servicing
mission
scheduled
for
days
in
pat
writes
how
different
would
the
contamination
threat
of
a
small
manuevering
tug
be
from
that
of
the
shuttle
and
its
oms
engines
the
aperture
door
will
be
shut
during
reboost
using
the
shuttle
means
that
there
will
be
someone
nearby
to
pry
the
door
open
again
if
it
should
stick
i
just
figured
if
goldin
wants
to
really
prove
out
faster
cheaper
better
have
some
of
the
whiz
kids
slap
together
an
expendable
space
manuevering
tug
out
of
a
bus
and
use
that
for
the
reboost
its
clear
that
the
whiz
kids
are
not
running
the
show
in
any
case
its
not
prudent
to
stick
a
slapped
together
explosive
device
on
the
end
of
a
billion
dollar
asset
that
youd
like
to
see
again
wiseacres
might
say
that
a
shuttle
is
a
slappedtogether
explosive
device
but
at
least
its
had
some
testing
