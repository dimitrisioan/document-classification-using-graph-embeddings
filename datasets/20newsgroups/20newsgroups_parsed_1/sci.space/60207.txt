re
pushing
the
envelope
in
elijah
millgram
writes
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
were
wondering
where
the
expression
pushing
the
envelope
comes
from
anyone
out
there
know
every
aircraft
has
flight
constraints
for
speedaoapower
when
graphed
these
define
the
flight
envelope
of
that
aircraft
presumably
so
named
because
the
graphed
line
encloses
envelopes
the
area
on
the
graph
that
represents
conditions
where
the
aircraft
doesnt
fall
out
of
the
sky
hence
pushing
the
envelope
becomes
operating
at
or
beyond
the
edge
of
the
flight
or
operational
envelope
note
that
the
envelope
isnt
precisely
known
until
someone
actually
flies
the
airplane
in
those
regions
up
to
that
point
all
there
are
are
the
theoretical
predictions
hence
one
of
the
things
test
pilots
do
for
a
living
is
push
the
envelope
to
find
out
how
close
the
correspondence
between
the
paper
airplane
and
the
metal
one
is
in
essence
pushing
back
the
edges
of
the
theoretical
envelope
to
where
the
airplane
actually
starts
to
fail
to
fly
note
too
that
this
is
done
is
a
quite
calculated
and
careful
way
flight
tests
are
generally
carefully
coreographed
and
just
what
is
going
to
be
pushed
and
how
far
is
precisely
planned
despite
occasional
deviations
from
plans
such
as
the
early
first
flight
of
the
f
during
its
highspeed
taxi
tests
im
sure
mary
can
tell
you
everything
you
ever
wanted
to
know
about
this
process
and
then
some
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
