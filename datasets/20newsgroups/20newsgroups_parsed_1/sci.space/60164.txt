holding
a
match
under
the
nozzle
is
just
nuts
one
thing
you
absolutely
must
do
in
such
an
engine
is
to
guarantee
that
the
propellants
ignite
as
soon
as
they
mix
within
milliseconds
to
do
otherwise
is
to
fill
your
engine
with
a
high
explosive
mixture
which
when
it
finally
does
ignite
blows
everything
to
hell
definitely
in
one
of
the
reports
of
an
early
test
conducted
by
rocketdyne
at
their
santa
susanna
field
lab
the
hill
above
the
san
fernando
and
simi
valleys
the
result
of
a
hung
start
was
described
as
structural
failure
of
the
combustion
chamber
the
inspection
picture
showed
pumps
with
nothing
below
the
cc
had
vaporized
this
was
described
in
a
class
i
took
as
a
typical
engineering
understatement

opinions
