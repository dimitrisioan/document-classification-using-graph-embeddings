why
dc
will
be
the
way
of
the
future
i
once
read
an
article
on
computer
technology
which
stated
that
every
new
computer
technology
was
actually
lower
and
slower
then
what
it
replaced
silicon
was
less
effective
then
the
germanium
products
then
available
gaas
was
less
capable
then
silicon
multiprocessors
were
slower
then
existent
single
processors
what
the
argument
was
though
was
that
these
new
technologies
promised
either
theoretically
future
higher
performance
or
lower
cost
or
higher
densities
i
think
that
the
dc
may
gfit
into
this
same
model
elvs
can
certainly
launch
more
weight
then
a
ssrt
but
an
ssrt
offers
the
prospect
of
greater
cycle
times
and
lower
costs
this
is
kind
of
a
speculative
posting
but
i
thought
id
throw
it
out
as
a
hjistorical
framework
for
those
interested
in
the
project
