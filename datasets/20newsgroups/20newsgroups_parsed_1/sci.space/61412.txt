but
try
to
land
a
shuttle
with
that
big
huge
telescope
in
the
back
and
you
could
have
problems
the
shuttle
just
isnt
designed
to
land
with
that
much
weight
in
the
payload
is
hst
really
that
much
heavier
than
a
spacelab
hst
is
about
lbs
kg
that
doesnt
include
the
cradle
that
would
have
been
in
the
cargo
bay
when
it
was
deployed
spacelabj
on
sts
was
lbs
according
to
the
presskit
as
someone
else
pointed
out
if
they
had
been
unable
to
deploy
it
for
some
reason
that
would
have
had
to
land
with
it
still
in
the
cargo
bay
and
this
was
a
planned
for
contingency
this
is
not
a
problem
for
the
shuttle
though
it
would
eliminate
ksc
as
a
landing
site
they
still
have
to
go
to
edwards
when
landing
with
something
like
spacelab
in
the
cargo
bay
