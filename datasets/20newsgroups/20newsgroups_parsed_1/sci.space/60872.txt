whats
a

good
for
and
i
ought
not
to
post
when
ive
a
hundred
some
odd
posts
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
economic
since
someone
with
space
industry
will
presumeably
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industry
eventually
they
will
simply
be
able
to
afford
more
stuff
if
i
read
you
right
youre
saying
in
essence
that
with
a
larger
economy
nations
will
have
more
discretionary
funds
to
waste
on
a
lunar
facility
that
was
certainly
partially
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
colonies
will
probably
require
a
continuing
military
scientific
or
commercial
reason
for
being
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the
money
why
not
approach
its
conceivable
that
luna
will
have
a
military
purpose
its
possible
that
luna
will
have
a
commercial
purpose
but
its
most
likely
that
luna
will
only
have
a
scientific
purpose
for
the
next
several
hundred
years
at
least
therefore
lunar
bases
should
be
predicated
on
funding
levels
little
different
from
those
found
for
antarctic
bases
can
you
put
a
person
base
on
the
