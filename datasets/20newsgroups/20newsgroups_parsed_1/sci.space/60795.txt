there
has
been
something
bothering
me
while
watching
nasa
select
for
a
while
well
i
shouldnt
say
bothering
maybe
wondering
would
be
better
when
they
are
going
to
launch
they
say
sorry
but
i
forget
exactly
who
is
saying
what
otc
to
plt
i
think
clear
caution
warning
memory
verify
no
unexpected
errors
i
am
wondering
what
an
expected
error
might
be
sorry
if
this
is
a
really
dumb
question
but
in
pure
speculation
i
would
guess
cautions
based
on
hazardous
prelaunch
ops
would
qualify
something
like
caution
srbs
have
just
been
armed
it
does
raise
an
interesting
question
as
to
how
hard
it
is
to
pick
out
an
expected
error
from
an
unexpected
error
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
