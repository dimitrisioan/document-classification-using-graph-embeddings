on

to
prepare
for
magnetometer

which
were
rescheduled
for
execution
in

c
on
tuesday

of
next

a
reload
of

will
take
place
this
morning
beginning
at

over
this
weekend
the
flight
team
will
send
realtime
commands
to
perform
differential

to
obtain
additional
data
for

the

will
occur
on

with

at

monday
evening
april
c
has
been
modified
to
include
magnetometer
calibrations
which
could
not
be
performed
in
c
due
to
contingency
mode
entry
on
april
these
magnetometer
instrument
calibrations
will
allow
the
instrument
team
to
better
characterize
the
spacecraftgenerated
magnetic
field
and
its
effect
on
their
instrument
this
information
is
critical
to
martian
magnetic
field
measurements
which
occur
during
approach
and
mapping
phases

will
require
the
sequence
to
command
the
spacecraft
out
of

state
and
perform
slew

to
provide
