being
wierd
again
so
be
warned
being
what
oh
weird
ok
im
warned
is
there
a
plan
to
put
a
satellite
around
each
planet
in
the
solar
system
to
keep
watch
i
help
it
better
to
ask
questions
before
i
spout
an
opinion
keep
watch
for
what
how
about
a
mission
unmanned
to
pluto
to
stay
in
orbit
and
record
things
around
and
near
and
on
pluto
i
know
it
is
a
strange
idea
but
why
not
oh
the
several
tens
or
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
it
would
cost
to
record
things
there
and
id
prefer
a
manned
mission
anyway
it
could
do
some
scanning
of
not
only
pluto
but
also
of
the
solar
system
objects
near
and
aaroundpluto
as
well
as
seti
and
looking
at
the
galaxy
without
having
much
of
the
solar
system
to
worry
about
weve
already
got
a
pretty
good
platform
to
scan
the
solar
system
as
well
as
seti
and
looking
at
the
galaxy
without
having
much
of
the
solar
system
to
worry
about
care
