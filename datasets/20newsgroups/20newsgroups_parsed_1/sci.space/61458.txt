as
for
human
tolerances
the
best
example
of
human
endurance
in
terms
of
altitude
ie
low
atmospheric
pressure
and
lower
oxygen
partial
pressure
is
in
my
opinion
to
the
scaling
of
mt
everest
without
oxygen
assistance
this
is
quite
a
feat
of
physiological
endurance
indeed
so
its
at
the
extreme
limit
of
what
is
humanly
possible
it
is
possible
only
because
mount
everest
is
at
a
fairly
low
latitude
there
is
a
slight
equatorial
bulge
in
the
atmosphere
beyond
what
is
induced
by
the
earths
rotation
thanks
to
the
overall
circulation
pattern
of
the
atmosphere
air
cools
at
poles
and
descends
flowing
back
to
equator
where
it
is
warmed
and
rises
and
this
helps
just
enough
to
make
everest
withoutoxygen
feasible
only
just
feasible
mind
you
the
guys
who
did
it
reported
hallucinations
and
other
indications
of
oxygen
starvation
and
probably
incurred
some
permanent
brain
damage
