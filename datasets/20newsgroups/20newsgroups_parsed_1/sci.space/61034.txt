writes
all
of
this
talk
about
a
commercial
space
race
ie
g
to
the
first
year
moon
base
is
intriguing
similar
prizes
have
influenced
aerospace
development
before
the
k
orteig
prize
helped
lindbergh
sell
his
spirit
of
saint
louis
venture
to
his
financial
backers
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
his
saint
louis
backers
had
the
foresight
to
realize
that
much
more
was
at
stake
than
could
it
work
with
the
moon
who
are
the
farsighted
financial
backers
of
today
the
commercial
uses
of
a
transportation
system
between
alreadysettled
andcivilized
areas
are
obvious
spaceflight
is
not
in
this
position
the
correct
analogy
is
not
with
aviation
of
the
s
but
the
long
transocean
voyages
of
the
age
of
discovery
lindberghs
flight
took
place
in
not
the
thirties
it
didnt
require
govt
to
fund
these
as
long
as
something
was
known
about
the
potential
for
profit
at
the
destination
in
practice
some
were
govt
funded
some
were
private
could
you
give
examples
of
privately
funded
ones
but
there
was
no
way
that
any
wise
investor
would
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
a
very
risky
investment
with
no
idea
of
the
possible
payoff
your
logic
certainly
applies
to
standard
investment
strategies
however
the
concept
of
a
prize
for
a
difficult
goal
is
done
for
different
reasons
i
suspect
im
not
aware
that
mr
orteig
received
any
significant
economic
benefit
from
lindberghs
flight
modern
analogies
such
as
the
prize
for
a
human
powered
helicopter
face
similar
arguments
there
is
little
economic
benefit
in
such
a
thing
the
advantage
comes
in
the
new
approaches
developed
and
the
fact
that
a
prize
will
frequently
generate
far
more
work
than
the
equivalent
amount
of
direct
investment
would
a
person
who
puts
up
x
billion
for
a
moon
base
is
much
more
likely
to
do
it
because
they
want
to
see
it
done
than
because
they
expect
to
make
money
off
the
deal
