re
why
dc
will
be
the
way
of
the
future
hmmm
i
seem
to
recall
that
the
attraction
of
solid
state
record
players
and
radios
in
the
s
wasnt
better
performance
but
lower
perunit
cost
than
vacuumtube
systems
mind
you
my
father
was
a
vacuumtube
fan
in
the
s
switched
to
solidstate
in
the
midseventies
and
then
abruptly
died
no
doubt
theres
a
lesson
in
that
and
his
account
could
have
been
biased
