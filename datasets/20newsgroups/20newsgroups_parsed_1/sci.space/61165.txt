description
of
external
tank
option
for
ssf
redesign
deleted
mark
proposed
this
design
at
joe
sheas
committee
in
crystal
city
and
he
reports
that
he
was
warmly
received
however
the
rumors
i
hear
say
that
a
design
based
on
a
wingless
space
shuttle
orbiter
seems
more
likely
yo
ken
lets
keep
ontop
of
things
both
the
external
tank
and
wingless
orbiter
options
have
been
deleted
from
the
ssf
redesign
options
list
todays
edition
of
the
new
york
times
reports
that
oconnor
told
the
panel
that
some
redesign
proposals
have
been
dropped
such
as
using
the
giant
external
fuel
tanks
used
in
launching
space
shuttles
and
building
a
station
around
an
existing
space
shuttle
with
its
wings
and
tail
removed
currently
there
are
three
options
being
considered
as
presented
to
the
advisory
panel
meeting
yesterday
and
as
reported
in
todays
times
option
a
low
cost
modular
approach
this
option
is
being
studied
by
a
team
from
msfc
as
an
aside
there
are
ssf
redesign
teams
at
msfc
jsc
and
larc
supporting
the
srt
station
redesign
team
in
crystal
city
both
lerc
and
reston
folks
are
also
onsite
at
these
locations
helping
the
respective
teams
with
their
redesign
activities
key
features
of
this
option
are
uses
bus
a
modular
bus
developed
by
lockheed
thats
qualified
for
sts
and
elvs
the
bus
provides
propulsion
gnc
communications
data
management
lockheed
developed
this
for
the
air
force
a
power
station
capability
is
obtained
in
shuttle
flights
ssf
solar
arrays
are
used
to
provide
kw
of
power
the
vehicle
flies
in
an
arrow
mode
to
optimize
the
microgravity
environment
shuttlespacelab
missions
would
utilize
the
vehilce
as
a
power
source
for
day
missions
human
tended
capability
as
opposed
to
the
old
ssf
sexist
term
of
mantended
capability
is
achieved
by
the
addition
of
the
us
common
module
this
is
a
modified
version
of
the
existing
ssf
lab
module
docking
ports
are
added
for
the
international
partners
labs
taking
the
place
of
the
nodes
on
ssf
the
shuttle
can
be
docked
to
the
station
for
day
missions
the
orbiter
would
provide
crew
habitability
eva
capability
international
human
tended
add
the
nasda
esa
modules
and
add
another
kw
of
power
permanent
human
presence
capability
add
a

module
the

module
and
an

vehicle
option
b
space
station
freedom
derived
the
option
b
team
is
based
at
larc
and
is
lead
by
mike
griffin
this
option
looks
alot
like
the
existing
ssf
design
which
we
have
all
come
to
know
and
love
this
option
assumes
a
lightweight
external
tank
is
available
for
use
on
all
ssf
assembly
flights
so
does
option
a
also
the
number
of
flights
is
computed
for
a
inclination
orbit
for
both
options
a
and
b
the
buildup
occurs
in
six
phases
initial
research
capability
reached
after
flights
power
is
transferred
from
the
vehicle
to
the
orbiterspacelab
when
it
visits
mantended
capability
griffin
has
not
yet
adopted
nonsexist
language
is
achieved
after
flights
the
us
lab
is
deployed
and
solar
power
module
provides
kw
of
power
permanent
human
presence
capability
occurs
after
flights
by
keeping
one
orbiter
onorbit
to
use
as
an
acrv
so
sometimes
there
would
be
two
orbiters
onorbit
the
acrv
and
the
second
one
that
comes
up
for
logistics
resupply
a
two
fault
tolerance
capability
is
achieved
after
flights
with
the
addition
of
a
nd
power
module
another
thermal
control
system
radiator
and
more
propulsion
modules
after
flights
the
internationals
are
onboard
more
power
the
habitation
module
and
an
acrv
are
added
to
finish
the
assembly
in
flights
most
of
the
systems
currently
on
ssf
are
used
asis
in
this
option
with
the
exception
of
the
data
management
system
which
has
major
changes
option
c
single

this
is
the

lead
option
basically
you
take
a
ft
diameter
cylinder
thats
ft
long
slap
space
shuttle
main
engines
on
the
backside
put
a
nose
cone
on
the
top
attached
it
to
a
regular

and
a
regular
set
of
solid

motors
and

some
key
features
are
