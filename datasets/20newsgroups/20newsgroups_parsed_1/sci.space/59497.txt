do
i
hear
the
deathknell
of
string
theory
i
agree
you
can
add
dark
matter
and
quarks
and
a
lot
of
other
unobservable
purely
theoretical
constructs
in
physics
to
that
list
including
the
omnipresent
black
holes
will
bruce
argue
that
their
existence
can
be
inferred
from
theory
alone
then
what
about
my
original
criticism
when
i
said
curvature
can
only
exist
relative
to
something
noncurved
bruce
replied
existence
is
undefined
unless
it
is
synonymous
with
observable
in
physics
we
can
not
observe
more
than
the
four
dimensions
we
know
about
at
the
moment
i
dont
see
a
way
to
defend
that
statement
and
the
existence
of
these
unobservable
phenomena
simultaneously
tom
i
hold
that
space
can
not
be
curved
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
can
have
no
properties
of
properties
we
can
only
speak
when
dealing
with
matter
filling
the
space
to
say
that
in
the
presence
of
large
bodies
space
becomes
curved
is
equivalent
to
stating
that
something
can
act
upon
nothing
i
for
one
refuse
to
subscribe
to
such
a
view

was
years
ahead
of
his

perhaps
now
