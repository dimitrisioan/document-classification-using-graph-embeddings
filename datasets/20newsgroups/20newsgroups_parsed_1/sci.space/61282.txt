secret
messages
robert
macelwaine
sez
again
larsonian
astronomy
and
physics
etc
ok
i
got
it
actually
these
message
of
macelwaines
are
coded
messages
read
only
the
caps
and
it
all
comes
clear
are
a
few
more
types
of
antimatter
atoms
worth
the
billion
cost
dont
we
have
much
more
important
uses
for
this
wasted
money
another
thing
to
consider
is
that
the
primary
proposed
location
in
texas
has
a
serious
and
growing
problem
with
some
kind
of
fire
ants
eating
the
insulation
off
underground
cables
how
much
poisoning
of
the
ground
and
ground
water
with
insecticides
will
be
required
to
keep
the
ants
out
of
the
supercollider
naming
the
super
collider
after
ronald
reagon
as
proposed
is
totally
absurd
if
it
is
built
it
should
be
named
after
a
leading
particle
physicist
maybe
its
a
message
telling
us
what
actually
happened
to
the
legendary
larson
perhaps
its
a
warning
that
one
should
not
expend
too
much
effort
trying
to
counter
macelwaines
postings
who
can
be
sure
tommy
mac
tom
mcwilliams
wk
they
communicated
with
the
communists
hm
and
pacified
the
pacifists
