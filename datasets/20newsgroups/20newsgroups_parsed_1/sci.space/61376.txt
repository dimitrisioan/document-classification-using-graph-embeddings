does
anyone
have
a
reference
something
i
can
look
up
not
just
your
own
recollections
i
have
a
few
of
those
myself
on
the
temperature
of
the
night
sky
as
seen
from
space
henry
if
i
read
you
correctly
you
may
be
asking
if
i
put
a
blackbody
in
interstellar
space
disregarding
the
sun
and
nearby
large
warm
objects
what
termperature
will
it
reach
in
thermal
equilibrium
with
the
ambient
radiation
field
if
thats
the
case
let
me
point
out
that
interstellar
dust
and
molecules
provide
many
instances
of
things
that
are
well
nottoofar
from
being
blackbodies
many
different
observations
including
iras
and
cobe
have
determined
that
interstellar
dust
grain
temperatures
can
range
from
k
to
k
yes
but
thats
because
interstellar
grains
are
very
poor
radiators
not
remotely
black
bodies
as
a
consequence
they
are
a
lot
warmer
than
the
ambient
inside
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
the
temperature
varies
quite
a
bit
from
place
to
place
how
close
are
you
to
the
nearest
ob
association
i
would
guess
outside
the
galaxy
of
course
things
arent
so
varied
when
i
was
in
graduate
school
a
long
time
ago
we
used
deg
k
with
a
dilution
factor
of
for
representative
values
of
the
radiant
energy
background
in
the
galaxy
due
to
starlight
