has
anyone
looked
into
the
possiblity
of
a
protoncentaur
combo
what
would
be
the
benefits
and
problems
with
such
a
combo
other
than
the
obvious
instability
in
the
xssr
now
i
havent
seen
any
speculation
about
it
but
the
salyut
kb
design
bureau
was
planning
a
new
lhlox
second
stage
for
the
proton
which
would
boost
payload
to
leo
from
about
to
kg
geostationary
goes
from
kg
gals
launcher
version
to
kg
this
scheme
was
competing
with
the
energiam
last
year
and
i
havent
heard
which
won
except
now
i
recently
read
that
the
central
specialized
kb
was
working
on
the
successor
to
the
soyuz
booster
which
must
be
the
energiam
so
the
early
results
are
energiam
won
but
this
is
a
guess
nothing
is
very
clear
in
russia
im
sure
if
salyut
kb
gets
funds
from
someone
they
will
continue
their
development
the
centaur
for
the
altas
is
about
meters
dia
and
the
proton
is
so
thats
a
good
fit
for
their
existing
upper
stage
the
blockd
which
sets
inside
a
shround
just
under
meters
dia
i
dont
know
about
launch
loads
etc
but
since
the
centaur
survives
titan
launches
which
are
probably
worse
than
the
proton
those
titan
srbs
probably
shake
things
up
pretty
good
it
seems
feasible
except
the
centaur
is
a
very
fragile
thing
and
may
require
integration
on
the
pad
which
is
not
available
now
protons
are
assembled
and
transported
horizontially
does
anyone
know
how
much
stress
in
the
way
of
a
payload
a
centaur
could
support
while
bolted
to
a
proton
horizontally
and
then
taken
down
the
rail
road
track
and
erected
on
the
pad
they
would
also
need
lox
and
lh
facilities
added
to
the
proton
pads
unless
the
new
proton
second
stage
is
actually
built
and
of
course
any
centaur
support
systems
and
facilities
no
doubt
imported
from
the
us
at
great
cost
these
systems
may
viloate
us
law
so
there
are
political
problems
to
solve
in
addition
to
the
instabilities
in
the
cis
