temperature

radiation
field
has
been
measured
and
modeled
by
various
groups
if
i
remember
things
correctly
the
models
involved
contributions
from
three
different
bb
sources
so
theres
no
obvious
temperature
of
background
radiation
in
our
local
area
indeed
the
sky
doesnt
look
much
like
a
black
body
if
you
look
carefully
enough
in
particular
its
temperature
at
radio
frequencies
is
quite
a
bit
higher
than
you
would
see
from
a
black
body
morgangordons

communications
satellite
handbook
has
a
graph
of
sky
temperature
vs
wavelength
in
fact
for
communications
design
however
in
terms
of
energy
content
the
rf
frequencies
are
negligible
for
thermal
purposes
at
very
large
distances
from
the
sun
the
sky
looks
like
a
black
body
at
k
allen
astrophysical
quantities
i
havent
found
a
number
for
nonlarge
distances
since
solar
radiation
tends
to
be
something
you
cant
just
ignore
but
mg
says
about
k
in
a
brief
discussion
of
why
solar
radiation
dominates
the
problem
svr
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
