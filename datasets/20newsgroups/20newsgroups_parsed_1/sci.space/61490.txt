single

launch
station
this
is
the
jsc
lead
option
basically
you
take
a
ft
diameter
cylinder
thats
ft
long
slap
space
shuttle
main
engines
on
the
backside
put
a
nose
cone
on
the
top
attached
it
to
a
regular
shuttle
external
tank
and
a
regular
set
of
solid
rocket
motors
and
launch
the
can
some
key
features
are
complete
endtoend
ground
integration
and
checkout
tangentially
mounted
fixed
solar
panels
body
mounted
radiators
which
adds
protection
against
micrometeroid
orbital
debris
centerline
docking
ports
one
on
each
end
berthing

a
single
pressurized
volume
approximately
cubic
feet
twice

volume
of

power
somehow
i
have
a
strange
attraction
for
this
idea
living
in
a
modular
home
maybe
has
altered
my
mind
the
only
thing
that
scares
me
is
the
part
about
simply
strapping
ssmes
and
a
nosecone
on
it
and
just
launching
it
i
have
this
vision
of
something
going
terribly
wrong
with
the
launch
resulting
in
the
complete
loss
of
the
new
modular
space
station
not
just
a
peice
of
it
as
would
be
the
case
with
staged
inorbit
construction
i
certainly
like
this
option
c
its
much
more
like
the
original
phase
b
studies
from
the
early
s
good
stuff
this
is
actually
more
like
the
stuff
from
phase
a
and
molphase
b
ended
with
a
power
tower
approach
its
also
very
expensive
in
terms
of
upfront
development
costsso
all
you
get
is
a
redistribution
of
costs
from
the
shuttle
flights
to
the
contractors
who
build
it
