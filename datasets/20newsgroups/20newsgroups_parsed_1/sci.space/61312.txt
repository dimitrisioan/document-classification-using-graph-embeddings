temperature
of
the
dark
sky
does
anyone
have
a
reference
something
i
can
look
up
not
just
your
own
recollections
i
have
a
few
of
those
myself
on
the
temperature
of
the
night
sky
as
seen
from
space
note
i
am
not
talking
about
the
temperature
of
the
microwave
background
radiation
there
are
more
things
in
the
sky
than
just
the
mbr
what
im
after
is
total
blackbody
temperature
what
a
thermal
radiator
would
see
disregarding
or
shielding
against
the
sun
and
nearby
large
warm
objects
my
dim
recollection
is
that
the
net
effective
temperature
is
substantially
higher
than
that
of
the
mbr
once
you
figure
in
things
like
stars
and
the
zodiacal
light
but
id
like
numbers
svr
resembles
a
