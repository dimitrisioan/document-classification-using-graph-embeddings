from
ken
kobayashi
ive
been
following
discussions
about
the
delta
clipper
program
and
i
have
one
small
question
as
i
understand
it
the
dcx
derived
orbital
vehicle
dcy
is
to
reenter
the
atmosphere
sort
of
sideways
not
completely
nosefirst
so
why
is
the
dcy
look
symmetric
in
every
drawing
ive
seen
i
would
think
that
an
asymmetric
design
sort
of
like
wingless
orbiter
may
work
better
since
less
shielding
is
required
on
the
top
side
can
anybody
explain
ken
kobayashi
ken
kobayashi
there
is
no
final
frontier
