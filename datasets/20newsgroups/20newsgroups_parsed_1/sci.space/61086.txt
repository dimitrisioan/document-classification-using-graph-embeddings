the
k
orteig
prize
helped
lindbergh
sell
his
spirit
of
saint
louis
venture
to
his
financial
backers
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
his
saint
louis
backers
had
the
foresight
to
realize
that
much
more
was
at
stake
than
could
it
work
with
the
moon
who
are
the
farsighted
financial
backers
of
today
the
commercial
uses
of
a
transportation
system
between
alreadysettled
andcivilized
areas
are
obvious
spaceflight
is
not
in
this
position
the
correct
analogy
is
not
with
aviation
of
the
s
but
the
long
transocean
voyages
of
the
age
of
discovery
lindberghs
flight
took
place
in
not
the
thirties
of
course
sorry
for
the
misunderstanding
i
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
far
more
aeronautical
development
took
place
in
the
s
for
much
of
the
s
the
superabundance
of
jennies
and
ox
engines
held
down
the
industry
by
many
of
the
obsolete
wwi
aircraft
had
been
retired
and
whirlwind
had
their
powerweight
ratio
and
reliability
up
to
the
point
where
longdistance
flights
became
practical
its
important
to
note
that
the
atlantic
was
flown
not
once
but
three
times
in
lindbergh
chamberlin
and
levine
and
byrds
america
when
its
time
to
railroad
you
railroad
it
didnt
require
govt
to
fund
these
as
long
as
something
was
known
about
the
potential
for
profit
at
the
destination
in
practice
some
were
govt
funded
some
were
private
could
you
give
examples
of
privately
funded
ones
not
off
the
top
of
my
head
ill
have
to
dig
out
my
reference
books
again
however
i
will
say
that
the
most
common
arrangement
in
prince
henry
the
navigators
portugal
was
for
the
prince
to
put
up
part
of
the
money
and
merchants
to
put
up
the
rest
they
profits
from
the
voyage
would
then
be
shared
but
there
was
no
way
that
any
wise
investor
would
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
a
very
risky
investment
with
no
idea
of
the
possible
payoff
a
person
who
puts
up
x
billion
for
a
moon
base
is
much
more
likely
to
do
it
because
they
want
to
see
it
done
than
because
they
expect
to
make
money
off
the
deal
the
problem
is
that
the
amount
of
prize
money
required
to
inspire
a
moon
base
is
much
larger
than
any
but
a
handful
of
individuals
or
corporations
can
even
consider
putting
up
the
kremer
prizes
human
powered
aircraft
orteigs
prize
lord
northcliffes
prize
for
crossing
the
atlantic
won
in
by
alcock
and
brown
were
much
smaller
the
technologies
required
were
within
the
reach
of
individual
inventors
and
the
prize
amounts
were
well
within
the
reach
of
a
large
number
of
wealthy
individuals
i
think
that
only
a
govt
could
afford
to
set
up
a
b
prize
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
note
that
burt
rutan
suggested
that
nasp
could
be
built
most
cheaply
by
taking
out
an
ad
in
avweek
stating
that
the
first
company
to
build
a
plane
that
could
take
off
and
fly

would
