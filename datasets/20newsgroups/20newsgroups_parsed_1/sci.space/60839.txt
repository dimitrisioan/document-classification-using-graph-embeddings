re
guns
for
space
in
reference
to
the
limits
of
acceleration
with
guns
launching
solid
rockets
as
payloads
thiokol
provided
me
with
samples
and
data
on
a
reinforcement
to
solid
motor
grains
for
high
accelerations
solid
motor
propellants
usually
have
a
substantial
percentage
of
aluminum
in
the
mix
for
example
the
space
shuttle
srbs
are
percent
aluminum
the
technique
is
to
use
a
foamed
aluminum
structure
the
structure
looks
like
the
inverse
of
a
set
of
bubbles
an
i
suspect
some
bubbling
process
is
used
to
form
it
in
other
words
if
you
made
a
bunch
of
bubbles
in
molten
aluminum
then
froze
it
this
is
what
you
get
it
forms
a
strong
network
of
effectively
aluminum
wires
in
all
directions
the
remaining
solid
fuel
mix
is
infiltrated
into
the
voids
and
you
get
aluminumreinforced
solid
propellant
the
foamedaluminum
makes
up
about
percent
of
the
total
propellant
so
there
is
still
aluminum
particles
in
the
bulk
grain
the
major
improvement
is
the
higher
resistance
to
grain
cracking
which
is
the
principal
failure
mode
for
solid
propellant
