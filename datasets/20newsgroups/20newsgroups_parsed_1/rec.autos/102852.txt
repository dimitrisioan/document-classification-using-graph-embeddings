while
taking
an
extended
easter
vacation
i
was
going
north
on
i
somewhere
between
centerville
tx
and
dallas
tx
and
i
came
upon
a
train
parked
on
a
trestle
with
its
locomotive
sitting
directly
over
the
northbound
lanes
there
appeared
to
be
movement
within
the
cab
and
out
of
curiosity
i
slowed
to
to
get
a
better
look
just
as
i
passed
from
underneath
the
trestle
my
radar
detector
went
into
full
alert
all
lights
lit
and
all
chirps
beeps
and
buzzes
going
strong
i
thought
i
had
been
nailed
good
but
no
police
materialized
could
this
have
been
caused
by
the
trains
radio
or
what
travis
boy
travis
were
you
lucky
you
went
under
the
new
texas
rangers
stealth
patrol
car

thing
