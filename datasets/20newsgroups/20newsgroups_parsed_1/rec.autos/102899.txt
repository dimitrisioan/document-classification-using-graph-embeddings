i
wish
i
had
the
figures
with
me
to
back
me
up
but
i
recall
statistics
showing
that
women
tended
to
have
more
accidents
than
men
but
the
damage
was
generally
quite
minor
men
had
fewer
but
far
more
expensive
accidents
the
rate
of
total
vehicle
destruction
was
significantly
higher
for
men
than
women
particularly
in
the
younger
male
age
groups
imho
social
considerations
are
probably
the
strongest
influence
here
possibly
more
so
than
any
difference
between
the
sexes
social
influences
often
affect
the
type
of
car
thats
bought
and
the
situations
the
car
is
used
in
and
the
type
of
car
and
driving
situations
have
a
major
effect
on
accident
risk
thus
if
society
expects
you
to
buy
a
mustang
and
race
it
on
the
street
youre
more
likely
to
do
it
and
our
society
expects
that
of
males
more
than
females
i
agree
with
some
of
your
social
influences
such
as
driving
conditions
but
lets
get
real
here
guys
dont
drag
race
becuase
there
expected
too
we
do
it
becuase
its
fun
and
we
find
out
whose
car
is
faster
guys
drive
different
than
women
becuase
there
men
when
a
driver
is
driving
unusually
i
can
usually
figure
out
if
it
is
a
male
or
female
driver
without
looking
at
the
driver
social
influences
may
give
a
person
more
reason
to
buy
a
vehicle
that
has
a
certain
amount
of
character
which
he
or
she
would
like
associated
with
do
you
change
your
driving
habits
when
no
one
is
around
sheesh
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
women
they
have
where
you
guys
live
but
there
are
some
ladies
here
who
will
blow
your
doors
off
or
at
least
they
will
try
to
but
we
just
cant
let
the
youngsters
get
too
uppity
with
us
old
folks
