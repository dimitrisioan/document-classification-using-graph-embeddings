just
stopped
putting
money
into
it
i
must
have
put
at
least
worth
of
repairs
over
its
lifetime
i
am
sorry
but
lee

can
bite
me
bullshit
whoever
backs
em
best
is
just
afraid
the
stupid
things
area
the
part
about
spending
on
repairs
reminds
me
of
an
article
i
read
in
a
magazine
comparing
the
year
ownership
costs
of
a
toyota
camry
and
a
ford
taurus
or
something
like
that
the
result
which
they
announced
with
great
flourish
was
that
it
cost
the
same
at
the
end
of
the
period
that
was
their
argument
to
prove
that
you
dont
go
wrong
buying
the
ford
taurus
over
the
camry
now
if
i
remember
correctly
the
camry
costs
about
or
so
more
in
initial
costs
essentially
it
means
that
you
spend
about
extra
on
repairs
on
the
taurus
that
is
ridiculous
every
time
your
car
needs
repairs
it
is
extra
hassles
loss
of
time
and
a
dozen
other
things
i
would
much
rather
spend
more
in
initial
costs
than
spend
more
in
repair
costs
cut
