most
cars
have
drain
petcocks
in
the
radiators
and
ive
never
seen
nor
heard
of
a
vandal
opening
one
i
imagine
that
there
would
be
an
even
lower
risk
with
an
oil
plug
because
you
have
to
crawl
furthur
under
the
car
to
open
it

vandals
are
usually
real
traditional
in
their
methods
and
do
things
that
dont
get
them
dirty
like
keying
your
car
dumping
sand
sugar
or
mothballs
in
the
gas
tank
tping
it
etc
usuallygo
enough
places
and
youll
see
stuff
happen
you
didnt
