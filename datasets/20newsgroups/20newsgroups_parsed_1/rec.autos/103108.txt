subject
re
saturns
pricing
policy
i
just
ordered
a
saturn
sl
after
considering
a
few
imports
frankly
the
saturn
way
of
doing
business
and
service
was
a
very
big
plus
i
hadnt
bought
a
new
car
since
i
bought
my
honda
wd
back
in
and
i
was
unbelieveably
offended
by
most
salespeople
i
met
saturn
was
indeed
very
different
i
made
three
different
visits
to
the
dealer
where
i
bought
my
car
and
was
never
pressured
saturn
also
had
the
best
aftersales
support
and
the
fixed
pricing
made
it
very
easy
for
me
to
decide
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
buy
another
big
selling
point
was
running
into
my
mechanic
at
the
dealer
hes
been
fixing
imports
for
yearsand
bought
a
saturn
based
on
what
hes
seen
and
heard
from
his
customers
saturn
also
has
a
good
extended
warranty
program
for
yeark
miles
fully
refunded
if
you
dont
use
it
that
works
out
to
an
actual
cost
of
or
so
based
on
the
year
treasury
rates
using
savings
account
rates
its
more
like
in
the
first
three
years
it
also
buys
you
free
rental
during
any
warranty
work
without
counting
against
the
refund
