im
planning
on
purchasing
a
new
car
and
will
be
trading
in
my
mazda
mx
dx
ive
still
got
more
years
to
pay
on
it
how
does
that
get
taken
into
account
when
i
purchase
my
new
car
does
the
dealership
pay
off
my
car
and
add
on
the
amount
they
had
to
pay
to
the
purchase
price
of
the
new
car
someone
please
explain
this
to
me
if
you
dont
already
know
it
you
should
call
the
bankcredit
union
finance
company
that
holds
the
loan
on
your
present
car
and
get
the
current
payoff
cost
if
you
are
trading
in
your
current
car
on
the
new
car
subtract
the
payoff
amount
from
the
tradein
the
dealer
is
giving
you
if
this
turns
out
to
be
a
negative
number
you
need
to
reconsider
the
deal
subtract
this
difference
from
the
price
of
the
new
car
this
is
the
size
of
the
loan
you
will
need
for
the
new
car
the
dealer
will
take
care
of
paying
off
the
loan
on
your
old
car
out
of
the
money
you
give
them
when
you
pick
up
your
new
car
at
least
thats
how
it
worked
for
me
years
ago
in
ohio
