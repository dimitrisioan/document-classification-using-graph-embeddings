better
still
years
ago
they
demonstrated
a
cold
air
system
which
only
used
air
it
was
called
a
rovax
the
unit
worked
very
well
the
short
coming
was
the
seal
technology
where
is
it
today
as
i
recall
from
reading
posts
here
a
while
back
rovax
rovacs
died
because
it
was
larger
and
noisier
than
the
competing
cheap
r
systems
of
it
day
probably
a
case
of
bad
timing
i
think
the
system
would
have
a
better
chance
today
now
that
r
systems
are
on
death
row
but
investors
may
be
hard
to
come
by
a
second
time
