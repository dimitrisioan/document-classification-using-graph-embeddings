shift
bigots
now
my
ego
with
regards
to
my
shifting
ability
is
as
big
as
anyone
elses
but
i
just
ordered
my
first
car
with
an
auto
trans
i
wasnt
planning
on
it
but
after
driving
a
few
i
was
convinced
things
have
changed
since
the
days
of
slip
n
slide
withe
powerglide
they
shift
better
than
i
do
theres
no
clutch
to
wear
out
honda
wanted
for
my
wd
wagon
last
year
got
it
done
for
it
only
costs
about
in
gas
milage
on
the
highway
and
it
makes
it
easier
to
concentrate
on
all
the
radios
in
my
car
oddly
enough
while
two
of
my
best
friends
both
in
the
auto
industry
here
in
the
motor
city
have
switched
wholeheartedly
to
autos
their
wives
insist
on
manual
shift
envy
braggadocio
aside
given
todays
technology
and
the
warranties
theyre
handing
out
the
auto
trans
seemed
like
an
excellent
choice
call
me
a
convert
