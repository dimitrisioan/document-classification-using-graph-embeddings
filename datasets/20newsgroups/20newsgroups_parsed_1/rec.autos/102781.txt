this
is
consistent
with
the
pre
the
engine
before
that
was
a
litre
or
less
depending
on
how
early
you
go
and
got
its
power
at
high
revs
starting
slowly
at
about
k
and
jumping
up
at
around
k
with
a
narrow
band
the
was
a
litre
and
had
a
lot
of
smog
equipment
if
you
got
much
power
at
all
itd
be
better
distributed
through
the
rev
range
bzzzt
wrong
answer
it
really
depends
on
whether
you
are
talking
model
year
or
date
of
manufacture
for
instance
mine
was
a
but
was
manufactured
in
august
of
prior
to
all
s
were
o
liter
for
the
and
model
years
they
were
liter
for
the
and
model
years
they
were
liter
except
for
the
carerra
rs
which
was
a
liter
the
and
later
years
were
easily
identified
by
the
new
mph
bumpers
most
models
in
the
year
were
lietsr
except
the
carerra
rsr
which
was
a
liter
us
carerras
from
were
liter
models
in
they
went
to
liter
and
there
was
only
a
single
model
the
sc
think
of
it
as
a
cross
between
the
s
and
the
carerra
models
note
all
the
above
are
based
on
model
year
not
date
of
manufacture
i
stand
corrected
this
is
all
from
memory
mind
you
as
for
the
rev
happy
behavior
the
earlier
cars
are
even
more
prone
to
this
the
liter
cars
used
low
compression
engines
and
suffered
a
bit
in
this
regard
the
early
liter
and
liter
engines
also
got
a
good
dose
of
smog
gear
as
well
the
and
liter
engines
were
far
and
away
the
quickest
revvers
of
the
lot
yeah
thats
what
i
was
trying
to
say
no
really
wade
guthrie
trying
to
program
on
msdos
is
like
trying
to
shave
with
a
chainsaw
me
be
not
speaking
for
the
rock
