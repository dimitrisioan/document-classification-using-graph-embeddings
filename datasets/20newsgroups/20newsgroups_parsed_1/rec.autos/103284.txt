i
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
if
we
removed
the
automatic
transmissions
from
all
performancetype
cars
like
the
l
mustangs
camaros
and
the
like
wed
cut
down
on
the
number
of
accidents
each
year
autos
are
fine
for
sedate
little
sedans
but
they
have
no
business
in
performance
cars
imho
james
i
have
to
disagree
with
this
i
have
a
z
with
a
and
a
speed
auto
w
overdrive
and
it
is
really
better
that
way
chevy
autos
are
reknowned
for
their
long
life
and
ability
to
handle
copious
amount
of
power
i
live
in
the
dallas
area
and
a
manual
would
be
much
harder
to
drive
in
the
traffic
here
now
if
i
still
lived
out
in
the
sticks
like
i
used
to
a
manual
would
be
more
fun
i
dont
know
if
its
as
much
an
issue
of
their
ablility
to
handle
the
power
as
it
is
the
power
they
lose
in
the
torque
converter
etc
safetywise
an
auto
is
less
distractingi
would
hate
to
have
to
be
shifting
gears
while
i
was
trying
to
ease
into
traffic
in
the
freeways
here
performancewise
i
can
hold
my
own
against
any
stock
mustang
or
camaro
w
a
five
speed
however
if
you
encounter
a
formula
with
l
speed
manual
youll
be
sol
im
afraid
btw
i
know
of
what
i
speak
as
a
former
owner
of
a
l
auto
iroc
and
current

the
