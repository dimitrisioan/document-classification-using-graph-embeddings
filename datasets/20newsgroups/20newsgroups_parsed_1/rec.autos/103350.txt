water
gradually
builds
up
in
the
trunk
of
my
friends
ford
probe
every
once
in
a
while
we
would
have
to
remove
the
spare
and
scoop
out
the
water
under
the
plywoodcarpet
cover
on
the
trunk
i
would
guess
this
usually
i
noticed
this
is
my
probe
also
when
recently
cleaning
out
the
back
i
think
the
water
is
coming
up
through
some
rubber
stoppered
holes
beneath
the
spare
mine
looked
slightly
worn
and
there
was
no
water
or
water
damage
i
have
the
same
problem
with
my
probe
the
water
is
definitely
not
comming
up
from
the
rubber
stoppered
hole
beneath
the
spare
i
have
to
remove
the
rubber
stopper
to
drain
the
water
seems
like
a
common
problem
with
probe
there
is
a
known
problem
with
the
seals
on
the
taillights
of
probes
complain
loudly
to
your
dealer
and
get
them
to
install
new
seals
it
is
a
known
problem
present
on
most
if
not
all
pre
probes
so
you
shouldnt
have
to
pay
them
to
fix
it
in
my
case
they
fixed
it
on
my
extended
warranty
i
just
had
to
pay
a
deductable
the
work
was
valued
at
something
like
with
labor
and
parts
having
removed
the
tail
lamps
myself
on
other
occasions
i
think
their
estimate
was
fair
