you
can
avoid
these
problems
entirely
by
installing
an
oil
drain
valve
in
place
of
the
bolt
i
have
one
on
both
of
my
cars
there
have
been
no
leaks
in
miles
combined
miles
on
both
cars
yes
but
then
someone
would
have
no
problem
draining
your
oil
in
a
parking
lot
all
they
have
to
do
is
reach
underneath
turn
a
valve
and
forget
the
trip
home
most
cars
have
drain
petcocks
in
the
radiators
and
ive
never
seen
nor
heard
of
a
vandal
opening
one
i
imagine
that
there
would
be
an
even
lower
risk
with
an
oil
plug
because
you
have
to
crawl
furthur
under
the
car
to
open
it
car
vandals
are
usually
real
traditional
in
their
methods
and
do
things
that
dont
get
them
dirty
like
keying
your
car
dumping
sand
sugar
or
mothballs
in
the
gas
tank
tping
it
etc
boycott
uslnovell
for
their
absurd
antibsdi
lawsuit
drew
eckhardt
condemn
colorado
for
amendment
two
use
linux
the
fast
flexible
and
free
unix
