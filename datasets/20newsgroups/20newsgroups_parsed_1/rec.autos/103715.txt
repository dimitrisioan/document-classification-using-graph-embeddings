btw
i
just
saw
the
new
q
on
tv
this
weekend
the
big
changes
a
grille
has
been
added
looks
nice
too
and
some
wood
for
the
interior
otherwise
it
looked
largely
unchanged
they
changed
the
lights
and
slope
of
the
hood
along
with
the
new
grille
otherwise
it
is
unchanged
interestingly
their
lack
of
wood
and
lack
of
a
grille
was
a
big
design
statement
they
tried
to
defy
conventional
wisdom
and
carve
their
own
niche
unfortunately
sales
were
only
half
those
of
the
lexus
and
hence
they
now
join
the
pack
i
still
wonder
if
much
of
the
problem
wasnt
the
slow
start
from
the
initial
ad
campaign
personally
i
like
the
q
without
the
grille
