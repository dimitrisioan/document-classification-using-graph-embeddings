mgb
questions
my
son
is
considering
the
purchase
of
a
mgb
which
has
been
substantially
restored
the
odometer
has
rolled
over
but
we
cant
be
sure
of
the
actual
mileage
the
engine
and
drive
train
apparently
werent
touched
in
the
restoration
except
for
a
new
carb
and
a
few
hoses
he
plans
to
do
vacuum
and
compression
checks
to
see
what
they
might
tell
us
about
the
engine
the
body
and
undercarriage
have
no
visible
rust
the
interior
is
new
as
are
tires
front
brakes
not
sure
about
the
back
battery
bumpers
and
other
misc
parts
the
paint
is
checked
in
a
few
places
and
scuffed
here
and
there
allegedly
by
a
windblown
car
cover
it
seemed
to
handle
ok
except
for
soft
front
shocks
questions
are
there
problem
areas
common
to
mgbs
we
should
check
out
the
brakes
seem
soft
and
rather
ineffective
what
should
we
expect
in
the
way
of
braking
action
it
seemed
to
be
doggy
when
accelerating
from
a
stop
what
should
we
expect
it
to
do
given
the
cylinder
engine
the
top
is
in
place
but
will
not
reach
a
number
of
the
snaps
the
weather
was
cold
should
the
vinyl
stretch
and
fit
when
it
warms
up
or
is
it
forever
shrunk
is
it
normal
for
the
wire
wheels
to
be
painted
or
are
they
usually
chromed
given
this
rather
limited
description
what
would
be
a
reasonable
price
gee
this
turned
out
to
be
a
little
longsorry
while
my
brother
once
owned
an
xk
jag
what
a
car
were
obviously
not
into
sports
cars
any
help
with
these
questions
or
suggestions
on
other
things
to
investigate
would
surely
be
appreciated
