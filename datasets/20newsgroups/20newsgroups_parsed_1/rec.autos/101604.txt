okay
ill
take
their
word
for
it
i
am
giving
every
chance
to
retract
figures
widely
known
the
mustang
is
rated
at
is
you
have
a
hp
advantage
over
a
mustang
seems
that
the
mustang
is
rated
at
hp
only
because
ford
changed
its
testing
procedures
under
the
older
procedures
it
still
rates
closer
to
hp
that
means
that
the
mustang
has
hp
more
and
you
still
havent
posted
any
weight
figures
for
the
mustang
big
threat
you
are
kod
by
a
civic
acording
to
cd
yeah
sure
in
your
wet
dreams
and
thats
probably
where
you
got
that
second
for
the
stealth
ill
check
cds
issue
strange
that
you
claim
to
have
that
go
ahead
and
check
asshole
youll
realize
what
an
idiot
you
are
for
not
checking
data
beforeposting
car
drive
may
stealth
es
hp
automatic
for
posts
now
youve
been
harping
on
this
may
issue
of
car
driver
without
posting
any
numbers
why
not
because
they
prove
me
right
and
you
aint
got
the
guts
to
admit
it
yeah
thought
so
the
sentra
ser
really
is
alot
quicker
than
the
hp
fwd
sports
car
you
are
close
to
the
k
sentrae
go
look
up
the
numbers
in
cd
and
report
please
no
im
going
to
play
your
game
no
way
sentras
are
slow
i
took
a
test
drive
and
it
took
to
go
why
even
the
hyundai
excel
blows
it
doors
off
any
yr
old
knows
that
i
race
and
ill
kick
your
butt
blah
blah
blah

see
yep
that
sounds
just
like
you
oh
man
i
just
got
it
beavis
butthead
thats
you
who
would
buy
a
fwd
automatic
that
costs
k
that
is
capable
of
only
a
and
would
plainly
be
dusted
by
a
ser
i
dunno
why
did
you
but
why
would
someone
pick
the
dodge
stealth
rt
over
the
nissan
sentra
all
it
takes
is
one
look
