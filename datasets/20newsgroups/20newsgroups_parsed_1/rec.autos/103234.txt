im
considering
switching
to

but
have
heard
that
they
do
not
assign

was
worried

be
a
real
pain

have
also
heard
that
they
try
to
get
rid
of

im
interestend
in
determining
whether
or
not
these
things
are
true

there
with
geico
made
a
claim
id
be
interested
in
hearing
whether
or
not
you
were
satisfied
with
the
service
and
whether
you
then
had
trouble
renewing
your
policy
