cant
help
you
with
your
question

i
do
have
a
comment
to
make
concerning
aftermarket
ac
units
i
have
a
frostking
or
frosttemp
forget
which
aftermarket
unit
on
my
cavalier
and
am
quite
unhappy

fan
is
noisy
and
doesnt
put
out
much
air
i
will
never
have
an
aftermarket
ac
installed
in

of
my
vehicles
again
i
just
cant
trust
the
quality
and
performance
after
this
experience
