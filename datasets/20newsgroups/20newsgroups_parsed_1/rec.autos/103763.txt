larger
engine
thats
what
the
sho
is
a
slightly
modified
family
sedan
with
a
powerful
engine
they
didnt
even
bother
improving
the
brakes
that
shows
how
much
you
know
about
anything
the
brakes
on
the
sho
are
very
different
inch
or
i
forget
discs
all
around
vented
in
front
the
normal
taurus
setup
is
smaller

i
saw
had
vented
rears
tooit
was
on
a
lot
of
course
the
sales
man
was
a
fooltitanium
wheelsyeah
right
then
later
told
me
they
were
magnesiummore
believable
but
still
crap
since
al
is
so
m
uch
cheaper
and
just
as
good
i
tend
to
agree
tho
that
this
still
doesnt
take
the
sho
up
to
standard
for
running
on
a
regular
basis
the
brakes
should
be
bigger
like
or
sotake
a
look
at
the
ones
on
the
corradoswhere
they
have
braking
regulations

yet
to
find
rs
in
any
other

rating
is
that
up

if
not
why
not
james
james
i
really
hate
to
do
this
but
try
reading
the
damn
posts
never
was
a
tbird
mentioned
the
discussion
was
about
shos
and
stangs
not
being
up
to
spec
i
do
not
know
about
tbirds
i
only
know
that
the
specs
quoted
for
the
sho
by
previous
poster
sounded
a
little
anemic
for
me
to
say
that
it
was
up
to
snuff
this
does
not
in
any
way
disencourage
me
from
wishing
to
own
one
nor
does
it
make
it
a
bad
car
it
merely
means
that
i
think
ford
could
have
added
that
extra
bit
of
safety
and
tossed
in
larger
brakes
as
the
wheels
are
plenty
large
enough
for
them
to
fit
if
memory
serves
right
which
it
may
very
well
not
and
the
motor
plenty
powerful
enough
to
need
it
