no
norway
com
and
edu
are
both
united
states
one
refers
to
commercial
institutions
the
other
to
mental
i
mean
educational
institutions
gov
is
also
pretty
much
us
it
refers
to
government
institutions
internet
was
built
on
the
aarp
backbone
a
us
defense
contractor
network
that
used
the
extension
i
think
you
mean
arpa
aarp
is
the
american
association
of
retired
persons
and
i
seriously
doubt
that
theyd
want
young
whippersnappers
building
anything
on
their
backbones
what
with
decalcification
and
all
to
identify
the
type
of
organisation
internet
extended
the
convention
for
other
countries
but
the
us
retained
the
old
conventions
the
general
convention
is
that
if
it
doesnt
have
a
country
tag
on
it
its
a
us
site
that
includes
com
commercial
edu
educational
mil
us
military
sites
gov
us
govt
nonmilitary
sites
eg
nasa
sites
org
anyone
who
is
none
of
the
above
there
are
sites
with
such
tags
that
are
nonus
sites
but
they
will
have
the
country
extension
eg
xxxxeduau
is
an
extension
i
saw
today
us
sites
can
also
use
the
us
extension
but
as
mr
smith
pointed
out
the
internet
was
built
on
the
arpanet
backbone
and
they
default
to
us
sites
if
theres
no
country
code
i
would
suggest
that
anyone
who
didnt
know
this
or
wants
to
know
more
about
it
on
a
nonsystemadministrative
level
check
out
the
book
thewholeinternetusersguideandcatalog
by
ed
krol
or
is
it
catalog
and
users
guide
i
can
never
remember
and
my
copy
is
my
desk
at
home
its
a
very
good
notnecessarilytechnical
guide
to
the
internet
and
the
various
utilities
that
lurk
on
it
including
usenet
i
dont
think
its
part
of
the
nutshell
series
but
it
is
published
by
oreilly
and
associates
this
should
go
to
one
of
the
news
newsgroups
but
damned
if
i
can
figure
out
which
one
