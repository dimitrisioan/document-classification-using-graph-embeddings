sorry
for
the
auto
content
but
that
is
why
lowabiding
citizens
should
have
the
power
to
protect
themselves
and
their
property
using
deadly
force
if
necessary
anywhere
a
threat
is
imminent
steve
heracleous
you
do
have
the
power
steve
you
can
do
it
why
dont
you
why
dont
you
go
shoot
some
kids
who
are
tossing
rocks
onto
cars
make
sure
you
do
a
good
job
though
dont
miss
cause
like
they
have
big
rocks
and
take
it
from
me
those
kids
are
mean
as
a
stong
selfdefense
advocate
youre
statement
does
littel
but
irk
me
of
course
shooting
someone
because
they
throw
a
rock
at
your
car
is
out
of
the
question
but
what
if
they
disabled
your
car
with
their
rock
and
then
wanted
to
come
killraperobbeat
or
otherwise
harm
you
your
wife
kids
i
think
you
would
like
the
power
to
defend
yourself
in
this
situation
wouldnt
you
or
is
it
that
you
value
the
lives
of
such
rock
throwers
more
than
your
own
or
those
of
your
family
dont
think
it
couldnt
happen
to
you
from
the
sounds
of
it
here
it
has
happened
to
a
few
people
please
do
not
misunderstand
the
only
justification
for
using
deadly
force
on
someone
is
that
if
you
dont
it
will
mean
your
own
death
or
grave
bodily
harm
i
am
far
far
away
from
supporting
vilante
justice
or
anything
like
that
oh
and
if
you
mean
to
be
funny
please
add
the
appropriate
followups
to
talkpoliticsguns
please
were
getting
a
bit
off
track
here
