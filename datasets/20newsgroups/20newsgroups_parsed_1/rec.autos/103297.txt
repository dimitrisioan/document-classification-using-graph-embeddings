ah
we
are
looking
for
good
people
just
like
you
we
are
a
very
concerned
group
of
citizens
who
are
absolutely
disgusted
at
the
way
that
the
majority
of
drivers
simply
disobey
traffic
rules
like
going
above
the
speed
limit
passing
on
our
right
and
riding
our
tails
while
all
the
while
we
respectfully
abide
by
the
rules
of
this
great
country
and
maintain
the
mandated
speed
limits
with
our
calibrated
certified
cruise
controls

many
times

for
those
unfortunate
ones
that
are
too
