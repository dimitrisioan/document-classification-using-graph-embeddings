you
can
avoid
these
problems
entirely
by
installing
an
oil
drain
valve
in
place
of
the
bolt
i
have
one
on
both
of
my
cars
there
have
been
no
leaks
in
miles
combined
miles
on
both
cars
yes
but
then
someone
would
have
no
problem
draining
your
oil
in
a
parking
lot
all
they
have
to
do
is
reach
underneath
turn
a
valve
and
forget
the
trip
home
but
there
is
less
likelyhood
they
have
a
wrench
with
them
i
personally
recommend
installing
a
special
locking
drain
plug
to
keep
vandals
away
