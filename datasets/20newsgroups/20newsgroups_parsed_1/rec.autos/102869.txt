you
could
take
a
screw
driver
and
hammer
and
start
punching
holes
in
various
locations
and
when
some
black
slippery
stuff
starts
pouring
out
then
you
would
know
that
the
oil
drain
plug
is
nearby
within
a
foot
or
two
anyway
close
the
holes
with
toilet
paper
before
refileing
with
oil
though
you
have
to
refill
the
engine
with
oil
wow
no
wonder
i
cant
get
an
engine
to
last
more
than
my
first
oil
change
dont
forget
to
punch
holes
in
the
radiator
too
it
will
spray
nice
refreshing
water
on
the
engine
and
keep
it
nice
cool
steve
gee
you
really
make
me
confused
what
is
radiator
where
is
it
located
what
does
it
look
like
will
it
release
any
radiation
since
it
sounds
like
radiation
generator
when
you
punch
holes
