cant
imagine
any
civic
or
saturn
owners
flexn
there
egos
in
stop
light
races
it
generates
as
much
excitement
as
two
nerds
challenging
each
other
in
a
game
of
oneonone
basketball
the
sl
does
in
about
note
that
this
is
closer
to
a
than
to
a
paseo
or
storm
pseudosporty
cars
thats
a
ridiculous
comparison
i
know
but
the
point
is
that
saturns
and
highend
civics
for
that
matter
accelerate
just
fine
in
fact
better
than
most
unimproved
muscle
cars
of
the
s
hp
is
great
but
tied
to
tons
it
just
doesnt
go
that
quick
saturns
on
the
other
hand
use
hp
tied
to
lbs
with
some
short
gearing
to
move
very
quickly
off
the
line
anyway
while
your
time
is
consistent
with
most
car
magazines
and
reports
i
saw
the
pbs
motorweek
show
clock
a
speed
sl
at
seconds
im
sure
that
most
sl
owners
will
be
very
lucky
to
get
this
speed
but
seconds
is
still
astonishingly
fast
for
a
small
door
a
new
civic
ex
runs
about
seconds
if
im
not
mistaken
most
cars
in
this
class
are
lucky
to
be
in
the
second
range
