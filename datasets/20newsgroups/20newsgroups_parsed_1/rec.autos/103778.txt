didnt
the
saab
sonnett
have
a
v
i
recall
someone
telling
that
it
was
something
like
of
a
ford
not
only
the
sonett
correct
spelling
but
the
wagon
and
sedan
used
a
cc
or
cc
v
from
ford
of
germany
this
particular
motor
had
a
degree
vee
angle
a
balance
shaft
and
siamesed
exhaust
ports
this
motor
was
later
stretched
into
the
v
commonly
seen
in
the
capri
i
think
it
was
the
reverse
the
v
being
of
the
v
the
v
could
make
pretty
reasonable
power
for
its
size
but
in
the
saab
it
made
too
much
torque
for
the
transmission
which
had
been
designed
for
a
cylinder
stroke
it
was
also
the
worst
engine
that
ford
europe
have
ever
made
bloody
awful
reputation
its
most
successful
application
being
the
transit
van
saab
gave
up
with
this
motor
and
then
made
the
triumph
half
a
stag
v
under
license
i
believe
but
with
litre
capacity
and
perhaps
a
different
arrangement
for
the
cylinder
head
studs
before
developing
their
own
straight
four
from
the
triumph
