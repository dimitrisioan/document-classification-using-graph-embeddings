i
am
considering
buying
a
used
taurus
sho
the
car
in
jj
question
has
k
miles
i
took
it
for
a
test
drive
the
other
day
jj
and
a
few
questions
came
up
jj
jj
jj
second
is
there
anything
i
should
specifically
look
for
in
an
jj
sho
of
this
vintage
anything
i
should
specifically
ask
abt
jj
brakes
cluthch
etc
i
noticed
on
the
drive
the
clutch
engagemen
jj
point
seemed
a
little
high
since
all
my
other
cars
are
autotragics
jj
im
not
sure
abt
this
point
i
had
my
foot
firmly
planted
on
the
jj
brake
when
i
started
it
up
there
was
a
bit
of
a
pop
in
the
pedal
jj
soon
after
the
engine
started
this
also
occured
on
a
few
tbird
sc
jj
i
test
drove
was
this
the
abs
self
test
brake
rotors
and
the
clutch
are
the
main
things
there
has
been
a
clutch
replacement
program
you
might
check
to
see
if
the
car
is
still
eligible
as
it
is
a
change
well
worth
making
you
can
also
swap
the
cruddy
cable
shifter
for
the
newer
rod
shifter
also
a
change
worth
making
but
thatll
cost
you
some
my
brakes
usually
do
one
wibblewobble
on
startup
so
that
is
probably
normal
didnt
know
they
had
a
selftest
thats
interesting
what
kind
of
tires
does
the
car
have
on
it
winqwk
b
for
a
good
time
dial
on
your
