one
more
way
which
works
in
manual
trans
cars
ive
driven
and
it
is
my
personal
favorite
the
other
suggestions
above
are
great
but
try
this
one
too
while
pushing
the
shifter
gently
towards
reverse
let
the
clutch
out
slowly
right
to
the
friction
point
and
the
shifter
will
be
pulled
into
position
if
you
do
it
right
the
car
wont
jump
backward
nor
will
the
gears
grind
you
will
just
glide
back
sam
i
can
vouch
for
this
method
in
my
sho
this
is
the
only
sure
way
of
putting
in
the
reverse
without
any
problem
every
time
