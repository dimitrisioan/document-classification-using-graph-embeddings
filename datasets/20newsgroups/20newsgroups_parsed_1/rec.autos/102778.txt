a
hunk
of
change
does
anyone

aftermarket
ac
installation

sorry
i
cant
help
you
with
your
question
but
i
do
have
a
comment
to
make
concerning
aftermarket
ac
units
i
have
a
frostking
or
frosttemp
forget
which
aftermarket
unit
on
my
cavalier
and
am
quite
unhappy
with
it
the
fan
is
noisy
and
doesnt
put
out
much
air
i
will
never
have
an
aftermarket
ac
installed
in
any
of
my
vehicles
again
i
just
cant
trust
the
quality
and
performance
after
this
experience
les
les
bartel
im
going
to
live
forever
let
me
add
my
in
i
had
a
ac
installed
by
the
ford
garage
and
it
did
not
work
as
well
as
the
ac
that
was
installed
by
the
factory
in
pickups
identical
to
mine
i
have
talked
to
other
people
that
have
had
the
same
result
dont
know
if
this
is
just
a
probable
with
ford
or
what
