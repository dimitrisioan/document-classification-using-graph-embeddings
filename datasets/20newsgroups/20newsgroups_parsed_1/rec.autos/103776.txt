from

eve
i
am
looking
to
buy
new
pr
tires
r
or
hr
i
dont
have
much
to
spend
but
i
would
like
a
tire
that
will
last
does
anyone
have
any
experience
with
the
following
brands
riken
falken
bfg
general
there
are
others
but
these
i
can
find
here
for
under
like
i
said
i
am
mostly
interested
in
threadwear
then
speed
since
i
hardly
get
to
drive
them
over
or
mph
also
is
it
true
that
noone
will
give
you
warranty
on
such
tires
according
to
a
tire
dealer
finally
do
hr
tires
last
longer
than
r
tires
threadwear
again
or
is
that
strictly
a
speed
factor
thanks
for
any
replies
whatever
doesnt
kill
me
makes
me
stronger
