ive
heard
unconfirmed
rumours
that
there
is
a
new
integra
being
released
for
well
you
can
just
about
set
your
watch
by
honda
releasing
new
models
every
years
and
an
upgrade
half
way
through
the
cars
life
the
local
acura
dealership
tells
me
that
the
new
integra
will
be
out
very
soon
ie
mayjune
its
hard
to
find
specific
details
as
the
integra
has
been
deleted
from
most
of
the
rest
of
the
world
i
have
seen
them
in
canada
and
australia
as
well
as
the
us
but
it
was
discontinued
after
the
first
generation
in
europe
normally
you
can
see
new
japanese
models
appear
in
europe
or
japan
first
and
extrapolate
from
there
cd
reported
that
the
engine
would
be
a
carryover
i
think
craig
does
anybody
have
any
info
on
this
the
local
sales
people
know
as
much
as
i
can
throw
them
parms
still
no
sig
