ill
give
you
a
few

neither

designed
to
turn
at
those
speeds
neither
car
was
designed
to
stop
quickly
from
those
speeds
safety
mechanisms
were
not
designed
for
impacts
at
those
speeds
an
uncontrolled
environment
leads
to
unpredictable

where
you
might
need
to
turn
or
stop
with
no
notice
do
you
by
any
chance
own
an
sho
or
have
access
to
one
such
that
you
would
have
any
idea
what
it
is
designed
for
or
how
it
handles
just
