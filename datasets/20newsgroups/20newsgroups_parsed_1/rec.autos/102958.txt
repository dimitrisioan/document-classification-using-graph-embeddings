is
it
worthwhile
to
get
an
alarm
system
on
a
new
car
what
features
are
important
what
features
are
unimportant
that
is
a
question
that
can
only
be
answered
by
yourself
and
where
you
live
if
you
live
in
a
place
where
crime
is
apparent
then
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
get
one
simply
as
a
deterrent
however
if
a
professional
thief
wants
your
vehicle
its
as
good
as
gone
no
matter
what
you
do
but
to
slow
down
any
thieves
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
get
the
basic
options
that
would
be
ignition
kill
or
fuel
cutoff
a
flashing
red
led
these
two
are
basic
to
a
decent
alarm
system
to
slow
down
the
criminal
some
more
get
a
steering
wheel
lock
that
should
be
sufficient
to
persuade
the
thief
to
find
an
easier
target
but
then
theres
always
carjacking
why
is
life
so
confusing
i
hope
i
helped
somewhat
