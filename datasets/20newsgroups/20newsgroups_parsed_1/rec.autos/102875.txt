re
warningplease
read
i
deleted
your
name
because
i
dont
want
to
sound
accusative
in
my
remark
this
is
a
twosided
problem
unfortunately
our
culture
has
been
deteriorating
over
time
the
breeding
of
these
lowlifes
is
getting
worse
our
justice
system
is
at
best
extremely
weak
to
handle
these
problems
that
is
why
lowabiding
citizens
should
have
the
power
to
protect
themselves
and
their
property
using
deadly
force
if
necessary
anywhere
a
threat
is
imminent
my
camaro
my
pride
and
joy
got
stolen
right
out
of
my
driveway
a
few
years
back
the
persons
that
did
that
were
eventually
caught
lucky
for
me
but
not
before
having
trashed
the
car
on
another
occasion
on
my
way
from
texas
to
florida
i
had
stopped
in
a
small
motel
for
the
night
in
a
small
town
somewhere
in
florida
about
youths
were
disturbing
my
car
setting
off
the
alarm
and
challenging
me
to
come
out
when
i
and
another
tenant
walked
out
with
a
magnum
and
a
automatic
respectively
they
vanished
needless
to
say
i
immediately
packedup
and
left
watch
out
for
carjacking
and
staged
accidents
they
can
be
deadly
im
not
going
to
argue
the
issue
of
carrying
weapons
but
i
would
ask
you
if
you
would
have
thought
seriously
about
shooting
a
kid
for
setting
off
your
alarm
i
can
think
of
worse
things
in
the
world
glad
you
got
out
of
there
before
they
did
anything
to
give
you
a
reason
to
fire
your
gun
we
can
all
ask
whats
happening
to
society
these
days
but
dont
forget
to
ask
another
important
question
too
what
effort
am
i
expending
to
make
it
any
different
than
it
is
just
my
thoughts
