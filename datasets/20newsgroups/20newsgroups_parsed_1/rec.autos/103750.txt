the
next
mustang
will
be
fords
highest
profile
car
it
attracts
way
more
attention
than
the
camarofirebird
because
its
heritage
is
more
embedded
in
the
general
public
dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believe
ford
will
forfeit
that
fyi
they
already
did
oh
really
when
too
bad
that
the
current
mustang
cant
even
compete
with
the
new
camaro
without
using
an
active
imagination
the
mustang
cobra
can
check
it
out
right
now
few
cars
can
compare
with
the
camaro
think
about
it
for
a
car
that
will
out
perform
all
but
a
few
exotics
if
you
are
now
swearing
at
me
look
at
the
statsthey
dont
lie
there
are
no
comparable
cars
in
its
class
certinaly
not
for
its
price
ehhhh
maybe
the
mustang
cobra
does
a
good
job
for
a
lower
price
and
its
just
a
taste
of
whats
ahead
in
the
th
anniversary
of
the
original
pony
car
unless
the
ford
gets
the
v
hp
romeo
you
dont
seriously
believe
that
it
was
designed
for
the
mark
viii
only
do
you
hey
can
you
imagine
the
potential
of
a
modified
lt
folks
in
a
few
years
we
will
surpass
the
levels
of
performance
achieved
in
the
late
s
thats
scary
just
think
corvettes
are
almost
up
to
the
performance
levels
of
a
cobra
wow
in
a
few
years
they
might
be
up
to
the
performance
levels
of
a
ford
gt
wow
man
just
think
about
it
