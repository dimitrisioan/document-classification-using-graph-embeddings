its
nice
to
know
that
im
not
alone
out
there
when
it
comes
to
clutch
etc
problems
on
late
model
hondas
if
i
get
a
few
more
supportive
responses
i
will
take
them
to
my
local
honda
dealer
or
maybe
send
them
to
the
regional
rep
in
southern
calif
for
their
input
on
the
problem
maybe
some
group
pressure
from
honda
owners
can
be
placed
on
honda
to
find
a
solution
such
as
a
retrofit
of
the
clutch
or
maybe
ill
just
sell
the
blasted
vehicle
and
go
back
to
driving
my
year
old
pickup
which
was
now
fixed
having
clutch
problems
and
caused
me
to
look
for
what
i
thought
would
be
a
troublefree
solution
ya
sure
not
to
put
down
honda
or
anything
the
accord
has
performed
flawlessly
in
all
other
areas
for
its
miles
as
it
is
said
out
of
all
this
something
will
develop
later
folks
not
alone
at
all
my
old
accord
now
in
the
hands
of
a
sibling
has
a
much
better
engagement
of
the
clutch
even
the
old
civic
we
keep
as
a
beater
feels
better
in
this
aspect
note
that
these
are
cars
with
kms
and
kms
respectively
my
prelude
blows
both
of
them
away
in
every
respect
except
smooth
clutch
engagement
of
course
the
kawasaki
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
but
i
need
more
than
wheels
most
of
the
time
the
prelude
has
had
a
dud
clutch
from
day
and
after
three
years
and
kms
is
no
better
best
of
luck
and
feel
free
to
add
this
to
your
collection
