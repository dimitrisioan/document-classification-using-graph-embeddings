differences
in
insurance
companies
rates
i
am
considering
buying
an
new
car
so
i
called
three
insurance
companies
in
california
to
get
estimates
i
asked
for
the
same
coverage
and
same
deductibles
most
of
the
companies
charge
you
according
to
your
zip
code
others
charge
according
to
your
city
anyhow
i
gave
the
same
zip
code
and
city
to
all
three
places
heres
what
i
found
for
a
integra
gs
aaa
yr
state
farm
yr
allstate
yr
aaa
is
nonprofit
so
they
said
i
could
also
expect
to
receive
about
back
at
the
end
of
the
year
still
there
is
a
huge
gap
between
all
of
these
companies
state
farm
wants
more
than
twice
as
much
as
allstate
i
think
i
should
be
suspicious
but
ive
never
heard
anybody
else
complain
any
comments
thanks
