ac
and

odometer
turned
k
and
the
sensor
light

blinking
i
went
to
the
dealer
and
he
said
it
was
a
maintenance
light
saying
i
need
to
change
the
oxygen
sensor
he
said
it
is
to
be
changed
every
k
but
since
i
bought
the
car
when
it
had
k
i
dont
know
if
the
same
thing
happened
at
k
and
k
he
quoted
for
the
part
and
to
install
it
the
part
cost
outside
but
the
mechanic
i
went
to
could
not
fix
it
saying
the
sensor
is
placed
too
deep
in
the
engine
parts
he
suggested
i
wait
till
it
malfunctions
before
i
do
anything
if
anyone
out
there
owns
a
chevy
sprint
i
want
to
know
how
they
got
their
oxygen
sensors
changed

problem
with
fixing
it
without
the
dealers
help

what
are
the
results
of
the
oxygen
sensor
malfunction

help
would
be
greatly
apprecisted

i
have
owned
my
sprint
from
the
beginning
and
that
sensor
light
comes
on
every
k
to
let
you
know
its
time
for
a
check
up
when
that
light
goes
on
i
just
take
it
to
the
delaer
tell
them
its
that
time
and
they
work
on
it
for
hou
and
you
pay
for
parts
and
for
labor
ahhwhat
they
get
for
labor
i
currently
have
about
k
on
my
sprint
and
of
all
the
times
i
took
it
in
for
service
i
never
say
on
the
payment
sheet
anything
about
the
replacement
of
the
oxygen
sensor
what
the
heck
is
an
oxygen
sensor
as
far
an
i
know
of
i
have
never
had
that
thing
replaced
in
my
car
and
the
car
is
purring
like
a
kitten
now
i
dont
have
ac
mother
nature
does
that
for
me
and
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
but
i
still
never
heard
of
an
oxygen
sensor
the
only
major
service
job
i
have
had
on
my
car
besides
getting
the
tires
replaced
if
you
want
to
call
that
a
service
job
was
getting
the
rotor
distributor
and
gasket
replaced
and
that
was
all
done
within
the
past
months
what
i
do
at
k
is
have
a
good
tuneup
let
them
replace
what
ever
they
need
to
pay
the
bill
about
and
go
home
and
dont
worry
about
the
car
for
another
k
oh
i
just
remembered
something
if
that
little
sensor
light
bothers
you
in
the
fuse
box
right
below
the
turnsignal
lever
up
against
the
dash
there
is
a
swith
on
the
right
side
flip
that
switch
and
the
light
will
go
off
i
do
that
so
that
little
light
wont
annoy
me
if
you
cant
find
it
look
it
up
in
the
car
manuel
i
hope
that
i
have
helped
a
little
and
good
luck
with
the
oxygen
sensor
