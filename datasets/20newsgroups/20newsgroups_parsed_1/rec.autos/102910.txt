i
just
visited
the
ny
auto
show
and
saw
two
lh
cars
on
the
floor
eagle
vision
and
dodge
intrepid
at
a
competitive
price
unfortunately
the
workmanship
is
quite
disappointing
on
both
cars
the
rubber
seals
around
the
window
and
door
fell
off
it
turns
out
the
seals
are
just
big
grooved
rubber
band
it
goes
on
just
by
pressing
through
a
single
data
point
you
can
draw
any
line

were
the

space
on

floor
by
the
previous
quote
i
guess
i
may
drow
a
determinstic
line
both
my
pastors
late
model
corolla
and
my
fathers
stanza
have
demonstrated
the
falling
door
seals
problem
as
unfair
as
it
may
seem
the
difference
between
chrysler
and
toyota
is
that
chrysler
needs
to
prove
that
it
can
build
quality
cars
toyota
can
afford
make
a
few
small
mistakes
without
hurting
the
image
after
all
door
seal
failing
on
a
year
old
stanza
is
not
comparable
to
the
same
problem
on
a
