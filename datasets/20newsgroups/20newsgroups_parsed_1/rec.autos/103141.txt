re
best
radar
detector
valentine
ive
had
a
valentine
for
about
months
now
and
i
agree
that
it
is
the
best
det
ector
available
the
point
here
is
trust
and
reliability
ive
been
able
to
tr
ust
the
valentine
more
than
any
other
detector
ive
owend
if
the
valentine
sa
ys
that
there
is
a
moderate
to
strong
radar
source
in
front
of
me
then
its
mo
re
than
likely
to
be
a
speed
trap
with
my
other
detectors
ive
gotten
so
many
falses
that
ive
begun
to
ignore
someo
of
the
warnings
because
i
didnt
want
t
o
drive
like
i
had
one
foot
on
the
brake
and
one
on
the
gas
pedal
that
directional
indicator
really
really
helps
plus
more
info
is
almost
alwa
ys
better
than
less
info
no
matter
how
smart
radar
detectors
get
the
human
br
ain
is
usually
smarter
so
if
im
going
to
make
a
decisio
based
on
information
at
hand
i
want
all
the
info
i
can
get
plus
if
you
divide
the
overall
streng
th
of
the
radar
signal
by
the
number
of
bogeys
reported
youll
find
that
each
bogey
is
pretty
weak
and
therefore
not
a
radar
threat
with
other
detectors
yo
ull
just
get
one
strong
warning
my
logic
may
be
faulty
on
this
but
i
think
i
t
works
okay
although
i
must
admit
that
i
havent
really
noticed
the
reflection
problem
of
one
radar
