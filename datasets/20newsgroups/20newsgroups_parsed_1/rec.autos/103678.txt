corrado
vr
in

the
corrado
vr
is
rated
as
best
handling
car
this
side
of
a
as
it
goes
i
just
read
an
article
in
autocar
motor
comparing
the
vr
to
a
ford
probe
later
to
be
launched
in
the
uk
the
vr
is
more
powerful
even
more
so
coz
its
instead
of
in
the
ec
and
more
fun
to
drive
etc
etc
but
the
probe
has
a
slightly
smoother
engine
thanx
mazda
mx
they
sum
it
up
as
both
cars
are
fast
the
vr
is
a
bit
more
exhilirating
to
drive
but
only
if
youre
prepared
to
work
harder
shaz
