does
anyone
know
why
autos
are
so
popular
in
the
us
while
here
in
europe
they
are
rare
just
wondering

sold
here
in
finland
are
small
and
cheap
cars
at
least
when
compared
to
other
cars
note
that
we
have
over
car
tax
and
you
couldnt
expect
a
good
auto
mated
to
a

of
the
bigger
cars
are
however
sold
with
