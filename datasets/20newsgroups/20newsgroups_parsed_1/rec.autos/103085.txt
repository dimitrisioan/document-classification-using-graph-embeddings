and
while
youre
at
it
why
bother
with
removing
the
drain
plug
when
you
could
remove
the
dipstick
instead
and
suck
it
out
from
there
with
your
mouth
and
then
spit
it
out
this
suggestion
isnt
as
farfetched
as
it
sounds
years
ago
in
another
time
and
place
i
used
to
do
oil
changes
in
boats
powered
by
automotive
engines
in
many
cases
there
was
no
way
to
get
any
sort
of
a
tray
under
the
oil
pan
because
it
was
boxed
in
by
the
bottom
of
the
hull
and
various
floation
chambers
on
each
side
and
if
you
did
get
something
there
youd
spill
all
the
oil
out
of
it
for
sure
trying
to
get
it
back
out
again
so
we
used
a
small
pump
powered
by
an
electric
drill
to
suck
the
oil
out
the
dipstick
hole
there
was
a
longthin
hose
on
the
inlet
side
designed
to
fit
down
the
dipstick
tube
and
another
thickershorter
hose
on
the
outlet
side
that
you
put
into
any
convenient
container
im
sure
these
gadgets
are
still
available
from
marine
hardware
suppliers

you
