as
a
matter
of
interest
does
anyone
know
why
autos
are
so
popular
in
the
us
while
here
in
europe
they
are
rare
just
wondering
in
many
of
our
cities
there
are
traffic
signals
every
feet
unsynchronised
of
course
well
here
in
ottawa
anyway
and
the
roads
are
so
congested
that
shifting
manually
is
a
real
pain
in
the
left
foot
also
most
canadians
are
too
stupid
to
learn
how
to
shift
manually
gee
i
got
ta
coordinate
my
two
feet
on
the
clutch
brake
and
accelerator
and
i
got
ta
steer
shift
and
operate
the
signals
optional
and
radio
with
my
two
hands
duh
it
cant
be
done
also
most
north
american
made
cars
come
with
the
automatic
as
standard
equipment
so
why
bother
with
a
manual
when
the
car
can
shift
for
you
for
no
addition
money
