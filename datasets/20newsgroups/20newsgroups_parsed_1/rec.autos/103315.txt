hi
ive
been
seeing
all
these
articles
about
changing
brake
fluid
and
i
am
wondering
if
this
is
really
necessary
i
have
an
toyota
corolla
sr
with
and
i
am
in
the
only
if
you
want
to
stop
seriously
though
every
years
you
should
have
this
done
brake
fluid
absorbs
water
over
time
the
water
becomes
steam
when
the
fluid
gets
hot
and
steam
compresses
youll
also
have
better
luck
with
the
longevity
of
master
cylinder
calipers
and
brake
lines
