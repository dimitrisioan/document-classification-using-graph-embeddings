moreover
if
saturn
really
does
reduce
the
dealer
profit
margin
by
then
their
cars
will
be
even
better
deals
say
if
the
price
of
a
saturn
was
already
below
market
average
for
the
class
of
cars
then
after
they
reduce
the
dealer
profit
it
would
be
below
market
average
it
will
attract
even
more
people
to
buy
saturns
because
it
would
save
them
money
force
the
competitors
to
lower
their
prices
to
survive
but
what
is
saturns
motivation
here
theyre
already
selling
every
car
they
make
with
multiple
shifts
in
the
plant
given
this
what
possible
motivation
could
they
have
to
lower
prices
