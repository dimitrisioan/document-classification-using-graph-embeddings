i
just
wanted
to
know
to
wheelspin
in
an
auto
you
keep
the
gear
in
n
gas
it
then
stick
the
gear
in
d
ive
never
tried
this
but
am
sure
it
works
but
does
this
screw
up
the
autobox
were
having
a
bit
of
a
debate
about
it
here
ah
yes
the
neutral
slam
i
know
that
gm
tested
the
old
ths
and
ths
by
shifting
from
reverse
to
forward
gears
repeatedly
while
holding
the
engine
at
high
rpms
the
units
hold
up
incredibly
well
this
is
also
the
recommended
technique
to
rock
a
stuck
vehicle
out
of
the
mud
i
think
the
hydraulics
are
up
to
the
task
but
the
mechanicals
of
the
driveline
may
object
by
breaking
something
ericy
i
agree
about
the
durability
of
the
old
th
trannies
from
gm
while
i
never
intentionally
slamed
my
firebird
ci
conv
into
gear
i
would
leave
the
trannie
in
low
read
st
grab
hold
hit
the
pedal
and
once
the
tires
grabbed
take
off
when
i
reached
about
mph
the
turbo
auto
would
shift
to
s
read
super
or
nd
and
leave
about
to
foot
of
double
stripped
rubber
on
the
ground
most
everyone
i
knew
at
the
time
was
quite
impressed
with
peeling
out
at
mph
the
trannie
held
up
just
fine
motor
mounts
would
last
about
a
year
until
i
tied
the
motor
down
with
large
chains
oh
yeafyi
pontiac
ci
bored
over
large
valve
heads
holley
spread
bore
crain
blazer
cam
dont
remember
the
specs
positrac
hooker
headers
dual

get
this
conv
leather
seats
power
windows
power
top
ac
cruise
etc
oh
yea
i
also
pulled
the
cocktail
shakers
weights
from
the
front
and
removed
the
lead
pellet
from
the
accelerator
pedal
damn
us
regulations
oh
how
i
miss
that
car
under
sec
and
about
to
mpg
well
i
dont
miss
the
mpg
front
wheels
off
the
ground
with
three
quick
jabs
at
the
pedal
bent
pushrods
stripped
rocker
studs
every
months
i
really
wonder
what
kind
of
revs
i
was
turning
no
tach

improvements
in
automatic

one
of
these

a
sec
