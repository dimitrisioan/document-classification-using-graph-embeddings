would
you
choose
to
have
beyond
the
basic
set
oil
pressure
oil
temperature
coolant
temperature
manifold
vacuum
ammeter
voltmeter
fuel
pressure
maybe
problematic

you
have

guages
connected
to

with
heaps
of
guages
its
hard
to
look
at
them
all
all
the

in
the
case
of
oil
pressure
for
example
you
want
to
know
right

if
your

goes
bad

a

two
of

would
be
a
