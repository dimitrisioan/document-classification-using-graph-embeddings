on
the
subject
of
the
vford
in
the
uk
used
v
engines
exstensively
in
their
ford
transit
vansthis
brings
back
a
memory
from
the
seventiesi
played
in
a
band
at
the
time
and
for
something
like
pounds
four
of
us
bought
a
tranny
to
cart
the
gear
around
init
was
in
terrible
shape
cosmetically
because
its
last
owner
was
a
pig
farmerwe
spent
days
cleaning
it
up
and
putting
in
a
partition
and
more
seating
but
til
the
day
it
died
everytime
you
turned
on
the
fan
to
the
defroster
dried
pig
shit
came
flying
out
the
vents
back
to
the
engine
if
i
remember
right
it
was
a
cc
v
and
that
thing
could
haulwe
could
fill
it
with
equipment
and
up
to
people
and
it
went
like
a
bat
out
of
hellof
course
there
were
no
pollution
controls
on
the
engine
and
the
gas
was
leaded
and
higher
octane
than
we
get
now
when
the
mechanical
fuel
pump
quit
we
put
in
an
electric
one
from
a
morris
minor
that
worked
great
ah
fond
memories
