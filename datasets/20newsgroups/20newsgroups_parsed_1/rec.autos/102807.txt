sorry
for
the
auto
content
but
that
is
why
lowabiding
citizens
should
have
the
power
to
protect
themselves
and
their
property
using
deadly
force
if
necessary
anywhere
a
threat
is
imminent
steve
heracleous
you
do
have
the
power
steve
you
can
do
it
why
dont
you
why
dont
you
go
shoot
some
kids
who
are
tossing
rocks
onto
cars
make
sure
you
do
a
good
job
though
dont
miss
cause
like
they
have
big
rocks
and
take
it
from
me
those
kids
are
mean
this
last
comment
was
obviously
a
bit
cynical
but
a
true
statement
of
the
attitude
of
some
drivers
theres
your
autos
content
i
would
say
what
lawabiding
not
lowabiding
as
above
talk
about
freudian
slips
citizens
have
the
right
and
responsibility
to
do
is
try
to
prevent
this
type
of
behaviour
in
children
a
doctor
may
have
to
use
deadly
force
against
a
part
of
a
body
like
amputating
it
when
an
infectiondisease
has
gone
too
far
but
his
real
desire
would
have
been
to
prevent
the
disease
in
the
first
place
or
at
least
nip
it
in
the
bud

these
are
my
opinions
which
should
only
make
you

they
