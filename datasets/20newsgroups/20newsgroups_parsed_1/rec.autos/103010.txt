this
happened
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of
ours
i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off
of
bridges
and
such
but
pound
rocks
has
our
society
really
stooped
this
low
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
at
well
people
fortunatly
or
unfortunatly
only
the
us
is
experiencing
the
devaluation
of
human
life
among
developed
nations
i
am
an
american
but
i
was
raised
in
europe
where
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
somebody
is
get
his
car
broken
into
or
have
his
pocket
picked
by
slaves
or
russian
refugees
of
cource
there
will
be
some
nutcases
but
thats
extremely
rare
ie
in
greece
you
can
walk
through
any
neighborhood
at
any
time
during
the
night
without
even
worrying
in
germany
you
can
walk
the
sidewalks
at
am
and
not
even
look
behind
your
back
at
the
sanitation
crews
that
clean
the
streets
to
a
sparkling
cleen
whoever
of
you
have
been
there
you
know
what
i
am
saying
i
dont
have
any
easy
answers
but
if
we
as
a
nation
do
some
selfcritisism
we
might
get
somewhere
of
course
these
postings
sould
be
in
soccultureus
but
if
we
reduce
crime
here
it
ll
mean
less
car
insurance
rates
thus
we
could
spend
more
money
on
modifing
our
cars

i
remember
this
happening
on
the
i
through
michigan
and
ohio
several
years
back
a
group
of
guys
in
an
old
beater
would
rear
end
a
car
usually
out
of
state
or
canadians
you
stop
and
they
smack
you
with
a
bb
bat
at
least
they
didnt
kill
you
for
the
sake
of
a
car
i
think
the
cops
put
out
decoys
and
this
calmed
down
for
a
while
vlasis
are
you
safe
walking
through
germany
if
you
are
a
refugee
