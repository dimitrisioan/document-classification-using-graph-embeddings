hi
would
someone
like
to
post
a
comparative
analysis
quantitative
measures
hp
etc
and
more
so
the
qualitative
feel
of
how
they
compare
for
the
driving
feel
handling
noise
responsiveness
etc
for
the
saab
s
and
the
bmw
series
any
comments
on
just
comparing
the
with
the
re
handling
i
take
it
that
the
saabs
and
bmws
are
comparable
for
reliability
and
all
thatwould
be
nice
if
flaming
wars
could
be
avoided
and
folks
just
post
their
experiences
i
had
a
saab
turbo
and
now
have
a
bmw
is
there
is
no
comparison
for
handling
reliability
or
overall
quality
of
engineering
the
bmw
wins
hands
down
after
years
i
was
sick
and
tired
of
the
all
the
little
problems
and
entropic
decay
of
the
saab
the
year
old
bmw
is
still
as
sweet
as
it
was
new
but
i
see
you
are
posting
from
western
ma
bmws
suck
in
the
snow
i
have
aggressive
snows
plus
a
hundred
pounds
of
sand
in
the
back
and
i
still
try
to
avoid
driving
in
the
snow
i
happily
took
the
saab
through
blizzard
conditions
without
a
worry
i
would
say
this
is
the
single
design
flaw
in
the
bmw
