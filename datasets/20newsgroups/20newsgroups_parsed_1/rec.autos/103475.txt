of
one
of
texass
adsyou
hear
a
guy
speaking
in
french
like
its
a
letter
home
then
the
french
moves
to
the
background
and
a
frenchaccented
voice
come
to
the
foreground
talking
about
how
he
went
walking
on
the
beach
and
it
felt
so
much
like
home
that
he
decided
to
take
his
shoes
offand
the
rest
of
his
clothes
it
ended
with
please

bail
on
an
recautos
note
does
anyone
carry
a
gun

them
or
keep

their
car

bad
idea
isnt
it
if
you
work
in
a
bad
part
of
town
or
regularly
go
through
one
is
this
a
loaded
question
i
normally
have
an
unloaded
colt
delta
in
my
glove
box
with
a
loaded
magazine
handy
which
is
perfectly
legal
in
oklahoma

those
times
that
im
travelling
interstate

keep
an
unloaded
sw
magnum
revolver
in
the
glove
box
with
a
speedloader
in
my
pocket
which
is
legal
everywhere

james
carrying
a
pistol
loaded
or
unloaded
in
the
glove
compartment
is
considered
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
in
colorado
and
is
illegal
without
a
concealed
weapons
permit
unless
the
law
has
been
changed
recently
carrying
a
weapon
openly
is
legal
in
colorado
but
concealing
it
is
illegal
i
read
a
newspaper
account
last
year
where
police
stopped
a
car
on
a
traffic
infraction
and
observed
a
magnum
revolver
sitting
on
the
seat
the
driver
could
not
be
cited
for
possessing
or
carrying
the
weapon
because
it
was
not
concealed
the
article
stated
that
if
the
gun
had
been
discovered
in
the
glove
box
it
would
have
been
considered
a
crime
ken
franklin
they
say
theres
a
heaven
for
people
who
wait
ama
and
some
say
its
better
but
i
say
it
aint
gwrra
id
rather
laugh
with
the
sinners
than
cry
with
the
saints
dod
the
sinners
are
lots
more
fun
yknow
only
the
good
die
young
