re
best
radar
detector
valentine
re
extended
ka
bands
i
recently
bought
a
band
detector
you
guys
must
all
think
im
nuts
right
well
i
did
a
little
research
into
ka
usage
in
this
area
and
found
out
that
ka
is
not
currently
being
used
in
this
state
as
well
as
surrounding
states
heres
how
i
found
out
a
cop
friend
who
did
spend
time
nailing
speeders
doesnt
even
know
what
ka
is
hes
heard
of
k
which
is
what
they
use
here
and
i
explained
that
ka
is
used
for
photo
radar
etc
he
then
said
yeah
ka
stands
for
k
automatic
duuhh
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
plans
were
being
made
for
getting
laser
guns
as
far
as
going
high
tech
were
concerned
but
he
didnt
know
too
much
my
year
old
band
whistler
was
consistently
going
off
at
speed
traps
even
the
real
sneaky
ones
when
i
called
the
escort
shop
they
confirmed
that
ka
is
not
used
here
or
in
surrounding
states
they
did
claim
that
laser
was
being
used
a
lot
here
which
i
was
quite
skeptical
of
so
in
the
end
instead
of
spending
a
lot
of
money
andor
waiting
months
for
a
state
of
the
art
detector
i
got
a
low
priced
high
performance
band
escort
incidentally
its
performance
is
equal
to
their
top
of
the
line
model
in
x
and
k
band
detection
i
know
that
escort
has
been
surpassed
by
other
brands
lately
but
ive
never
fully
relied
on
a
detector
and
i
was
convinced
that
the
escorts
would
be
at
least
quite
good
which
was
good
enough
for
me
and
my
wallet
eliot
