i
can
put
a
valve
v
with
twin
garrets
on
yugo
and
get
sec
qm
thats
useless
its
still
a
yugo
that
will
loose
any
race
on
a
track
or
on
the
street
a
yugo
that
will
go
mi
in
seconds
will
not
lose
on
the
street
thats
just
too
damn
quick
it
might
be
wrapped
around
a
telephone
pole
at
the
end
of
that
quarter
mile
but
it
will
be
there
alone
have
you
detroit
beings
compared
the
ultralongthrow
stick
shifts
of
the
with
the
mr
turbo
or
rx
i
ll
buy
it
in
mos
or
you
could
replace
the
stock
shifter
with
a
hurst
shortthrow
shifter
available
from
ford
motorsport
or
any
number
of
other
aftermarket
products
to
boost
the
performance
of
a
mustang
or
camaro
can
you
do
that
with
a
rx
or
verily
with
any
mr
with
the
detroit
aftermarket
you
can
build
a
mustang
or
camaro
which
is
superior
to
either
car
you
mention
for
less
than
the
sticker
price
of
either
or
the
torsen
differential
of
the
rx
compared
to
the
differential
of
the
that
sounds
in
every
hairpin
turn
well
gee
it
works
and
it
doesnt
break
it
transmits
power
to
the
drive
wheels
and
its
essentially
zero
maintenanceand
theres
an
aftermarket
in
parts
for
ford
and
chevy
rearends
too
and
bythe
way
and
camaro
both
have
drums
on
the
rear
breaks
hello
this
is
the
s
well
the
mustang
cobra
which
from
all
reports
uses
the
same
running
gear
as
mustang
has
wheel
disks
i
cant
speak
for
the
new
camaro
but
i
think
it
does
too
also
stop
and
think
about
the
markets
here
the
mustang
is
and
always
has
been
a
massmarket
sporty
car
thats
where
the
pony
car
class
came
from
with
a
performance
model
thats
why
it
has
the
econobox
running
gear
that
was
also
factored
into
the
design
of
the
mustang
from
the
day
lee
iacocca
conceived
his
baby
it
was
designed
as
a
widemarket
carsporty
yet
accessiblewith
room
for
performance
tweaking
the
cars
you
listed
are
designed
for
a
specific
market
niche
and
they
both
fit
those
niches
very
well
the
mustang
at
least
does
well
in
multiple
markets
i
cant
speak
for
the
camaro
