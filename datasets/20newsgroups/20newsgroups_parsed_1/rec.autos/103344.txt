camrys
eating
clutch
master
cyls
i
have
both
an
and
an
camry
each
with
manual
speed
transmissions
the
has
about
miles
on
it
and
the
about
miles
about
a
year
ago
i
found
that
the
master
cylinder
on
the
clutch
in
the
was
leaking
fluid
around
the
piston
seal
leading
to
air
in
the
system
and
fluid
back
into
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car
i
pulled
the
plunger
and
got
a
rebuild
kit
new
plunger
seal
etc
and
thought
i
had
the
problem
licked
much
to
my
surprise
the
same
problem
developed
several
months
later
this
time
i
looked
carefully
at
the
master
cylinder
to
make
sure
there
were
no
scratches
burrs
or
other
obvious
causes
of
the
problem
i
didnt
find
any
ever
since
i
have
been
periodically
feeding
the
clutch
hydraulins
additional
fluid
and
bleeding
air
from
the
system
i
knew
i
would
be
selling
the
car
and
didnt
want
to
go
all
the
way
to
solving
the
problem
i
should
add
that
the
clutch
is
original
and
that
ive
had
to
adjust
the
pedal
to
allow
maximum
extension
of
the
piston
into
the
master
cylinder
in
order
to
actuate
the
clutch
my
hypothesis
is
that
this
means
that
when
fully
depressing
the
clutch
pedal
the
angle
of
the
piston
rod
attached
to
the
pedal
is
off
the
axix
of
the
cylinder
thus
cocking
the
piston
and
seal
and
perhaps
deforming
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
an
explanation
can
you
suggest
a
possible
fix
short
of
replacing
the
master
cylinder
and
getting
a
new
clutch
put
in
now
the
same
problem
except
that
the
above
diagnosis
doesnt
explain
why
all
of
the
fluid
leaked
out
by
way
of
the
master
cylinder
into
the
passenger
compartment
while
i
was
on
vacation
for
days
during
which
the
clutch
pedal
was
not
depressed
or
otherwise
caused
to
distort
what
can
you
suggest
here
many
thanks
lets
hope
i
dont
end
up
going
to
click
and
clack
on
this
bill
