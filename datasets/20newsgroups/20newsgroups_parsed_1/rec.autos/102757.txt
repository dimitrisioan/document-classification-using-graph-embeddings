this
reminds
me
of
the
first
time
my
cousin
did
an
oil
change
on
his
car
he
crawled
under
removed
a
bolt
drained
the
fluid
replaced
the
bolt
then
carefully
poured
in
quarts
of
oil
didnt
bother
to
check
the
dip
stick
just
drove
off
didnt
get
too
far
till
me
found
out
that
hed
drained
the
speed
trans
and
dumped
an
extra
quarts
into
the
engine
moral
as
craig
said
dont
be
ashamed
to
get
some
in
person
help
the
first
time
