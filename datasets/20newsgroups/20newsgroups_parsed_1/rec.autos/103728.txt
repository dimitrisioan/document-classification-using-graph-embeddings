re
vibration
when
brakes
are
applied
hi
javier
how
are
things
at
corp
my
old
stomping
ground
was
clevel
vibration
when
applying
the
brakes
can
be
caused
on
disc
brakes
at
least
by
warped
rotors
when
the
brakes
are
applied
there
results
uneven
pressure
on
the
rotor
turning
the
rotors
by
a
brake
shop
will
remedy
this
problem
as
long
as
there
is
enough
rotor
width
left
for
turning
ie
within
spec
there
could
be
some
possible
front
end
suspension
problem
but
a
brake
shop
should
be
able
to
confirm
warped
rotors
by
a
visual
inspection
which
is
free
