for
a
reasonable
sum
you
can
get
a
bmw
with
traction
control
a
torquesensing
limited
slip
rear
differential
traction
control
as
far
as
the
optional
feature
that
one
buys
with
cars
is
not
the
same
thing
at
all
as
a
torque
sensing
differential
a
torque
sensing
differential
is
a
type
of
lsd
but
not
all
lsds
are
torque
sensing
viscous
coupled
differentials
as
opposed
to
viscous
couplings
are
rotational
sensing
not
torque
sensing
for
that
matter
so
are
traction
control
systems
that
use
abs
sensors
and
pulse
braking
then
there
are
the
older
positracs
and
whatever
