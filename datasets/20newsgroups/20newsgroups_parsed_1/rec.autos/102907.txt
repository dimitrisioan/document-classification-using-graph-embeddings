i
can
remember
reading
a
track
competition
in
some
carmagazine
which
featured
the
testarossa
the
diablo
and
the
vt
the
result
was
about
the
same
i
would
have
expected
the
cizeta
was
not
only
the
slowest
of
the
three
but
also
dropped
out
halfway
during
its
test
laps
because
of
smoking
brakes
for
a
sportscar
it
showed
ridiculous
performance
hm
i
find
this
hard
to
believe
vt
weights
about
the
same
as
the
red
head
but
it
has
hell
lot
more
horse
power
perhaps
its
due
to
preproduction
glitches
well
to
me
it
still
got
the
most
imposing
styling
among
all
the
sports
cars
i
have
seen
bye
chris
ferrari
f
best
sportscar
ever
built
personally
i
dont
like
cars
that
rely
on
turbo
power
i
guess
everyone
has
their
favorite
car
