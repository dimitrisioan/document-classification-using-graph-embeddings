now
now
before
we
get
too
carried
away
here
keep
in
mind
that
owning
any
car
in
korea
is
a
luxury
that
only
the
ruling
class
can
afford
every
government
agency
worth
its
salt
finds
some
reason
to
levy
a
tax
on
car
ownership
last
i
heard
there
were
seven
different
fees
to
pay
to
own
a
car
i
believe
this
is
the
sort
of
petty
bureaucratic
inefficiency
that
new
president
kim
young
sam
wants
to
eradicate
basically
i
think
the
rules
came
into
place
as
bureaucrats
from
plebian
backgrounds
wanted
to
wreak
revenge
on
the
ruling
class
in
exchange
zaibatsus
like
hyundai
screwed
over
smaller
companies
perpetuating
a
vicious
cycle
i
have
faith
that
korean
people
can
potentially
build
cars
as
well
as
anyone
else
but
for
now
hyundai
cars
seem
to
reflect
the
tensions
within
society
of
screwy
components
that
wont
work
together
stubborn
like
a
mule
the
car
either
wont
go
forward
or
wont
stop
at
all
hahahahahaha
gasp
pant
hm
im
not
sure
whether
the
above
was
just
a
silly
remark
or
a
serious
remark
but
in
case
there
are
some
misconceptions
i
think
henry
robertson
hasnt
updated
his
data
file
on
korea
sincemid
s
owning
a
car
in
korea
is
no
longer
a
luxury
most
middle
class
people
in
korea
can
afford
a
car
and
do
have
at
least
one
car
the
problem
in
korea
especially
in
seoul
is
that
there
are
just
so
many
privatelyowned
cars
as
well
as
taxis
and
buses
the
rushhour
has
become
a
hour
phenomenon
and
that
there
is
no
place
to
park
last
time
i
heard
back
in
january
the
kim
administration
wanted
to
legislate
a
law
requireing
a
potential
car
owner
to
provide
his
or
her
own
parking
area
just
like
they
do
in
japan
also
henry
would
be
glad
to
know
that
hyundai
isnt
the
only
car
manufacturer
in
korea
daewoo
has
always
manufactured
cars
and
i
believe
kia
is
back
in
business
as
well
imported
cars
such
as
mercury
sable
are
becoming
quite
popular
as
well
though
they
are
still
quite
expensive
finally
please
ignore
henrys
posting
about
korean
politics
and
bureaucracy
hes
quite
uninformed
