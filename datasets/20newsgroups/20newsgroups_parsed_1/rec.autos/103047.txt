sorry
for
the
auto
content
but
that
is
why
lowabiding
citizens
should
have
the
power
to
protect
themselves
and
their
property
using
deadly
force
if
necessary
anywhere
a
threat
is
imminent
steve
heracleous
you
do
have
the
power
steve
you
can
do
it
why
dont
you
why
dont
you
go
shoot
some
kids
who
are
tossing
rocks
onto
cars
make
sure
you
do
a
good
job
though
dont
miss
cause
like
they
have
big
rocks
and
take
it
from
me
those
kids
are
mean
that
is
absolutely
correct
they
have
a
streak
of
meanness
that
runs
much
deeper
and
stronger
than
anything
i
ever
experienced
even
during
the
height
of
the
s
racial
struggles
i
am
absolutely
convinced
that
there
are
kids
out
there
today
that
have
no
concept
of
right
and
wrong
but
have
the
human
intelligence
which
is
turning
them
into
the
greatest
predators
that
have
ever
walked
the
earth
they
will
prevail
unless
the
rest
of
humanity
decides
that
it
is
in
their
best
interest
to
stand
up
against
these
feral
humans
and
for
individuals
to
start
taking
some
responsibility
for
their
own
protection
in
a
state
in
which
the
individuals
turn
to
the
authorities
and
police
for
protection
the
police
and
government
is
soon
composed
of
the
very
feral
humans
that
they
originally
sought
protection
from
gee
i
guess
you
touched
my
hot
button
id
better
go
cool
off
somewhere
