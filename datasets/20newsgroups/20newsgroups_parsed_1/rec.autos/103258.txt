yes
i
saw
a
turbo
quattro
wagon
on
i
in
nj
on
monday
i
thought
audi
stopped
selling
wagons
in
the
us
after
the
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
vehicle
i
would
like
to
own
i
bet
its
price
is
times
my
car
budget
think
again
thanks
to
minutes
tick
tick
tick
used
quattros
are
bargains
s
go
for
about
k
s
go
for
perhaps
or
k
more
the
valve
s
are
quite
a
bit
more
because
of
an
enormous
hp
and
torque
gain
i
think
they
go
for
about
to
k
if
you
can
find
one
i
have
seen
quite
a
lot
of
quattros
not
that
many
wagons
though
at
the
dealer
lot
they
use
very
high
quality
paint
and
the
entire
car
is
zinc
galvanized
so
it
will
never
rust
in
short
typically
a
yr
old
looks
no
more
older
than
a
year
old
and
the
bangers
are
bullet
proof
engines
k
out
of
one
is
not
rare
even
for
a
turbo
which
is
watercooled
for
the
s
then
there
are
aftermarket
chips
that
you
can
buy
to
bump
up
turbo
boost
if
you
are
into
luxogizmos
the
cars
are
loaded
with
just
about
everything
too
the
price
of
parts
is
a
different
story
though
eliot
