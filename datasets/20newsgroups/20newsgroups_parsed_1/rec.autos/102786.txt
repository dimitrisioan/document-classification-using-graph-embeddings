lights
on

theyre
on
the
sides
of
the
car
sure
would
be
interested
to
know
what
years
this
was
i
dont
seem
to
recall
any
car
with
backup
lights
on
the
sides
much
less
any
corvette
i
suppose
i
could
be
misinterpreting
what
you
are
trying
to
say
here
just
a
quick
comment
backup
lights
mounted
on
the
side
would
actually
be
extremely
useful
for
people
backing
out
of
parking
stalls
regards
charles
within
the
span
of
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
heard
elements
of
separate
threads
which
in
that
they
have
been
conjoined
in
time
struck
together
to
form
a
new
chord
within
my
hollow
and
echoing
gourd
unknown
netperson
wasnt
the
original
intent
of
the
reverse
lights
for
the
driver
so
he
could
see
where
he
was
backing
up
although
reverse
lights
on
the
sides
are
useful
for
telling
whether
cars
are
backing
up
out
perpendicular
to
the
path
of
the
car
i
dont
think
warnings
were
their
original
intents
since
