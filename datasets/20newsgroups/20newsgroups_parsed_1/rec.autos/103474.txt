anyone
else
experiencing
a
similar
problem
this
concerns
the
clutch
on
a
honda
accord
speed
when
the
clutch
is
first
used
in
the
morning
about
the
first
miles
of
shifting
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
clutch
chatter
until
things
warm
up
then
the
clutch
shifts
smoothly
this
chatter
started
when
i
moved
to
the
san
francisco
bay
area
from
a
lowhumidity
environment
the
dealer
stated
that
this
is
known
to
happen
since
honda
changed
from
an
asbestos
to
nonasbestos
clutch
material
no
remedy
seems
that
moisture
on
clutch
surface
causes
slipping
until
the
moisture
evaporates
any
comments
out
there
the
clutch
on
my
honda
civic
exv
ex
in
the
us
does
this
too
its
annoying
now
that
i
think
about
it
is
worse
when
the
humidity
is
high
the
dealer
also
claims
theres
nothing
they
can
do
since
the
clutch
is
a
selfadjusting
hydraulic
design
yeah
right
