are
there
any
mr
owners
or
motorhead
gurus
out
there
that
know
why
my
mrs
engine
sounds
noisy
the
mrs
engine
is
noisy
at
the
best
of
times
but
not
even
a
nice
nose
its
one
of
those
very
ugly
noises
assuming
yours
is
a
non
turbo
mr
the
gruffness
is
characteristic
of
a
large
inline
that
doesnt
have
balance
shafts
i
guess
toyota
didnt
care
about
little
details
like
that
when
they
can
brag
about
the
mid
engine
configuration
and
the
flashy
styling
myself
i
automatically
cross
out
any
car
from
consideration
or
recommendation
which
has
an
inline
larger
than
liters
and
no
balance
shafts
it
is
a
good
rule
of
thumb
to
keep
in
mind
if
you
ever
want
a
halfway
decent
engine
if
the
noise
really
bugs
you
there
is
nothing
else
that
you
can
do
except
to
sell
it
and
get
a
v
eliot
nice
theory
too
bad
the
mrs
never
came
with
a
four
cylinder
over
liters
more
like
or
did
they
were
the
nonturbo
mriis
or
some
such
i
also
understand
that
anyone
using
balancing
shafts
on
four
cylinders
must
pay
saab
a
royalty
for
using
their
patented
designlike
porsches
i
