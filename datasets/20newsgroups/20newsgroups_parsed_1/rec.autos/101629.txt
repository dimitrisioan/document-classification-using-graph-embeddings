i
am
interested
to
find
out
if
there
is
any
domestic
car
manufacturer
especially
gm
and
ford
which
produces
bulletproof
luxury
sedans
i
understand
caddy
is
working
on
one
double
battery
super
high
perf
engine
more
gauges
a
bit
stretched
etc
lots
of
communication
equipment
the
works
color
selection
is
limited
though
the
problem
is
that
the
guy
at
penn
avenue
is
about
to
get
it
pres
clinton
last
time
it
was
a
lincoln
this
time
a
caddy
i
am
just
wondering
if
this
socalled
bulletproof
perhaps
reinforced
windows
special
materials
for
the
bodyengineetc
luxury
car
lincoln
and
cadillac
models
is
readily
available
to
the
public
not
to
my
knowledge
i
know
gm
does
conversion
work
for
things
like
hot
climates
ie
the
chevy
caprices
sold
to
the
middle
east
but
things
like
that
are
always
done
by
third
parties
not
the
manufacturer
maybe
you
will
need
to
buy
a
specific
package
that
has
beefedup
everything
perhaps
the
police
cruiser
package
on
the
capricecrown
vic
and
start
from
there
do
we
have
to
go
through
any
special
dealership
to
obtain
these
cars
i
would
really
like
to
hear
from
anyone
who
has
experience
with
the
bulletproof
cars
and
i
wuz
drivin
along
in
my
armored
seville
sts
and
this
punk
pulls
out
of
nowhere
with
an
rpg
rocket
propelled
grenade
but
the
bulletproof
windshield
stopped
him
dont
think
many
people
on
the
net
have
a
need
for
bulletproof
cars
check
with
local
armored
service
companiessecuritybodyguard
places
theyd
know
best
i
think
your
average
luxury
car
dealer
will
have
a
coronary
if
you
told
them
ill
take
the
blue
caprice
with
options
fz
fuzzy
dice
pr
power
everything
and
ar
armor
any
information
regarding
the
dealers
and
aftermarket
shops
that
have
bulletproof
lincolns
and
cadillacs
is
greatly
appreciated
you
may
email
me
at
or
post
the
message
in
this
newsgroup
if
you
believe
other
netters
might
be
interested
as
well
btw
same
information
on
mercedesbenz
bmw
lexus
and
infiniti
luxury
sedans
is
needed
as
well
if
you
have
it
i
believe
an
article
on
the
conversion
process
appeared
in
the
car
press
within
the
last
few
months
