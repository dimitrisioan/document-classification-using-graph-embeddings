re
manual
shift
bigots
in
article
writes
but
why
not
turn
the
question
around
why
are
automatics
so
common
in
the
us
because
some
people
like
them
and
some
people
actually
need
them
my
guess
is
that
when
they
tried
to
couple
manuals
to
the
torquerich
vs
in
the
sixties
the
clutches
turned
out
as
real
killers
you
had
to
use
both
feet
to
depress
and
that
this
has
just
lived
on
yeah
right
real
muscle
cars
had
a
manual
transmission
and
their
clutches
arent
that
heavy
shelbyamerican
used
plenty
of
highpowered
hightorque
engines
and
carroll
only
put
autos
in
his
cars
because
people
wanted
them
blasphemers
heretics
burn
them
burn
them
for
defiling
a
shelby
with
an
auto
real
cobras
and
they
were
the
ultimate
sports
car
at
the
time
had
bigblock
fords
which
turned
out
prodigious
amounts
of
power
and
torque
and
none
of
them
had
automatics
and
also
an
automatic
with
a
v
engine
can
be
real
fun
to
drive
yeah
if
you
call
a
gear
shift
in
the
middle
of
a
curve
fun
i
personally
would
love
to
have
a
galaxie
liter
coupe
with
a
firebreathing
and
fouronnafloor
to
go
along
side
my
galaxie
pillarless
hardtop
with
a
firebreathing
with
threeonnatree
i
love
the
sound
of
dual
exhaust
in
the
morning
theres
no
comparison
between
a
real
american
muscle
car
and
a
car
with
a
big
engine
and
an
automatic
