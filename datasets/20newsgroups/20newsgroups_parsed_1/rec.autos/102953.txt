thanx
to
all
those
who
responded
particularly
those
never
driven
an
xxx
but
heres
what
its
like
guys
ok
we
all
know
that
newage
ats
are
great
in
traffic
and
do
a
satisfactory
job
in
acceleration
when
you
keep
your
foot
buried
in
the
carpet
my
question
regards
downshifting
not
downshifting
to
pass
ats
are
good
at
this
now
but
manually
moving
the
lever
to
or
at
a
point
where
you
would
downshift
a
manual
eg
approaching
a
red
light
or
a
curve
or
just
tooling
around
a
parking
lot
in
st
or
nd
wo
shifting
this
is
why
im
still
a
manualtrans
bigot
the
downshifting
for
deceleration
seems
so
natural
when
i
try
this
in
an
automatic
the
tranny
doesnt
seem
to
understand
what
i
want
addendum
isnt
it
great
after
downshifting
while
approaching
that
red
light
when
the
light
goes
green
and
youre
already
oncam
or
the
turbos
already
spooled
up
zippppppppppp
hagen
i
have
a
grand
am
with
auto
and
quad
around
the
gear
selector
there
is
a
plastic
strip
which
covers
the
space
so
you
cant
see
inside
anywayi
took
the
cover
off
and
cut
the
end
of
this
long
strip
to
a
specific
length
the
strip
curls
up
into
a
cirlce
at
one
end
inside
anyway
by
doing
this
the
strip
cant
feed
into
the
lip
that
circles
itsoi
can
push
button
pull
down
and
the
gear
shifter
will
only
go
back
to
from
driveno
accidental
hitting
first
i
drive
around
town
in
to
keep
the
revs
up
shift
to
drive
above
and
pull
down
to
when
coming
up
to
lightsif
i
want
if
i
am
eating
foodi
drive
in
drive
there
are
probably
aftermarket
shift
kits
that
will
accomplish
the
same
thing
porsches
tiptronic
automatic
can
be
driven
like
an
autoor
put
into
mode
tip
upupshifttip
down
downshift
of
course
there
is
an
override
so
you
dont
redline
the
engine
