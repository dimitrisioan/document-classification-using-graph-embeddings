like
to
get
some
feedback
on
a
car
with
most
bang

range
im
looking
for
a
car
with
enough
civility
to
b

driven
every
day
or
even
on
long
trips

when
i
hit

i
want
to

take
a
look
at
a
taurus

they
can
be
found
for

are
the
ultimate

put
out

hp
in

these
cars
also
have
handling
to
match
the
muscle
and
are
civil
in
regular
driving
conditions
rather
than
having
a
harsh

awd
turbo
is
clearly
the
better
choice
of
the
two

you
