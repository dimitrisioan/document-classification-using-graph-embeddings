this
just
a
warning
to
everybody
on
the
net
watch
out
for
folks
standing
next
to
the
road
or
on
overpasses
they
can
cause
serious
harm
to
you
and
your
car
just
a
cliffnotes
version
of
my
story
follows
pm
last
night
i
was
travelling
on
the
interstate
here
in
knoxville
i
was
taking
an
offramp
exit
to
another
interstate
and
my
wife
suddenly
screamed
and
something
large
hit
the
side
of
my
truck
we
slowed
down
but
after
looking
back
to
see
the
vandals
standing
there
we
drove
on
to
the
police
station
she
did
get
a
good
look
at
the
guy
and
saw
him
cock
his
arm
with
something
the
size
of
a
cinderblock
but
i
never
saw
him
we
are
very
lucky
the
truck
sits
up
high
on
the
road
if
it
would
have
hit
her
window
it
would
have
killed
her
the
police
are
looking
for
the
guy
but
in
all
likelyhood
he
is
gone
i
am
a
very
good
driver
knock
on
wood
but
it
was
nighttime
and
i
never
saw
the
guy
the
police
said
they
thought
the
motive
was
to
hit
the
car
have
us
stop
to
check
out
the
damage
and
then
jump
us
and
take
the
truck
please
be
aware
of
folks
and
for
your
own
good
please
dont
stop
peace

as
long
as
were
on
the
subject
several
years
ago
myself
and
two
others
were
riding
in
the
front
of
a
toyota
pickup
heading
south
on
interstate
north
of
seattle
wa
someone
threw
a
rock
of
an
overpass
and
hit
our
windshield
not
by
accident
im
sure
it
was
impossible
to
get
up
to
the
overpass
quickly
to
see
who
did
it
we
figured
it
was
kids
reported
it
and
left
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
happend
again
and
killed
a
guy
at
my
company
he
was
in
his
midfourties
and
left
behind
a
wife
and
children
turned
out
there
was
a
reformatory
for
juviniles
a
few
blocks
away
they
caught
the
year
old
that
did
it
they
put
a
cover
over
the
overpass
what
else
could
they
do
i
dont
think
ill
over
forget
this
story
in
des
moines
iowa
about
a
year
ago
some
kid
dropped
a
rock
from
an
overpass
and
hit
car
just
behind
the
windshield
it
put
a
dent
in
the
roof
so
i
guess
i
was
lucky
it
hit
metal
its
frustrating
that
we
cant
do
much
bother
the
city
government
to
put
covers
on
all
overpasses
slow
downspeed
up
a
bit
when
driving
under
all
overpasses
in
the
city
i
like
the
first
better
but
that
will
take
time
and
lots
of
people
talking
to
the
city
governments
