gts
headlight
covers
i
have
a
eagle
talon
and
i
wanted
a
pair
of
gts
headlight
covers
actually
they
are
turning
signal
covers
since
the
talons
that
year
had
popup
lights
i
went
to
a
auto
shop
and
bought
the
taillight
blackouts
for
but
they
did
not
have
the
turning
signal
covers
in
stock
i
asked
how
much
it
would
be
and
he
told
me
it
would
cost
me
another
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
high
for
two
small
pieces
of
plastic
can
anyone
find
me
a
cheaper
pair
or
even
a
used
