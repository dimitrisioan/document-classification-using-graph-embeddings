is
there
a
resource
available
to
the
consumer
comparing
all
of
the
makes
and
models
of
automobiles
trucks
vans
etc
for
survivability
in
a
crash
of
different
severities
also
ive
found
very
little
objective
data
comparing
different
vehicles
for
handling
pickup
braking
expected
maintenance
etc
i
recall
years
ago
consumer
reports
annual
buyers
guide
was
much
more
informative
in
those
aspects
than
it
is
now
thanks
to
a
reply
from
someone
i
looked
a
little
further
and
found
what
i
was
looking
for
the
april
cr
magazine
has
most
of
the
above
things
despite
recent
articles
here
the
ratings
looked
pretty
good
for
relative
comparison
purposes
unfortunately
the
crash
test
comparisons
didnt
include
half
of
the
cars
im
comparing
anybody
know
how
honda
civic
hatchbacks
and
toyota
tercels

in
an
accident
