crazy
question
anyone
ever
wonder
how
birds
can
drop
a
load
on
a
car
going
over
mph
i
took
a
nonstop
trip
got
shitted
on
four
times
every
time
hitting
the
windshield
not
even
the
open
sunroof
guess
we
have
conscientious
birds
was
going
mph
i
used
to
have
a
galaxie
convertible
was
sitting
at
a
light
waiting
for
it
to
turn
green
it
turned
green
but
i
hesitated
a
little
sleeping
i
guess
and
a
bird
bombed
me
it
landed
directly
in
front
of
me
at
eye
level
i
guess
the
bird
miscalculated
and
thought
i
was
going
to
take
off
right
away
and
im
still
trying
to
figure
out
the
one
i
got
under
my
rear
bumper
as
well
was
the
bird
flying
up
and
doing
fancy
acrobatics
at
my
car
and
decided
to
drop
one
while
executing
a
perfect
loop
