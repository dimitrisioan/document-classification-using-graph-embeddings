i
am
considering
buying
one
of
these
two
vehicles
new
i
want
a
funtodrive
family
vehicle
that
can
go
through
anything
the
jeep
is
very
popular
and
has
the
features
allwheeldrive
wheel
antilock
roomy
passenger
cabin
but
limited
cargo
with
an
internal
spare
the
toyota
is
an
aging
design
with
only
parttime
wheel
and
only
rear
antilock
and
no
antilock
in
wd
it
also
has
a
very
inconvenient
rear
gate
not
to
mention
awkward
ingress
to
the
passenger
cabin
any
reason
you
are
limited
to
the
two
mentioned
they
arent
really
at
the
same
point
along
the
suv
spectrum
not
to
mention
price
range
how
about
the
explorer
trooper
blazer
montero
and
if
the
budget
allows
the
land
cruiser
bear
in
mind
that
of
all
suvs
purchased
never
venture
offroad
carefully
weigh
the
tradeoff
between
comfort
and
offroad
performance
when
choosing
one
and
realistically
decide
whether
youll
actually
make
enough
use
of
the
offroadability
to
sacrifice
some
of
the
onroad
comfort
