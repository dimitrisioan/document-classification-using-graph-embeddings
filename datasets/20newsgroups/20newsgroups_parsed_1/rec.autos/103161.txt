subject
choice
of
gauges
if
you
had
free
reign
to
design
your
own
instrument
cluster
which
gauges
would
you
choose
to
have
beyond
the
basic
set
i
consider
the
basic
set
to
be
tach
coolant
temp
or
cylinder
head
temp
for
aircooled
engines
oil
pressure
amps
speedo
fuel
others
that
are
nice
to
have
volts
maybe
this
should
be
in
the
basic
set
vacuumboost
i
can
think
of
a
few
others
but
what
are
your
ideas
and
why
