the
villagerquest
seem
like
the
best
of
the
cravanvoyager
copies
to
come
along
since
the
mazda
mpv
the
nissan
maxima
engine
paired
with
the
maxima
speed
auto
trans
should
be
an
excellent
drive
train
and
the
rest
of
the
vehicle
seems
well
engineered
only
the
price
is
controversial
hmm
the
last
time
i
checked
villagerquest
does
not
have
a
maxima
engine
and
is
very
much
under
powered
for
its
weight
same
engine
different
state
of
tune
less
hp
and
maybe
more
torque
my
friend
at
work
regularly
takes
people
in
his
and
it
seems
to
haul
around
just
fine
