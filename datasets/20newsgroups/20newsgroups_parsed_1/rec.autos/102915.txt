hi
maybe
someone
can
help
me
here
i
am
looking
to
buy
this
nissan
maxima
gxe
for
cdn
right
now
so
its
an
automatic
dont
know
if
us
speccdn
spec
for
maximas
the
car
has
km
or
about
miles
on
it
a
typical
mileage
for
cars
seem
to
be
about
km
or
about
k
mi
the
seller
just
informed
me
that
when
he
brought
the
car
in
for
certification
he
was
told
that
the
front
break
pads
and
the
exhausts
had
to
be
replaced
to
meet
the
legal
standards
he
said
he
will
replace
the
components
before
selling
the
car
to
me
being
copmletely
ignorant
to
the
technical
stuff
on
cars
i
dont
know
what
this
could
mean
is
k
km
about
the
time
typical
for
replacing
the
above
mentioned
items
or
is
this
an
indication
that
the
car
was
abused
if
it
is
the
first
set
of
brake
pads
on
front
then
this
is
fine
my
car
eats
a
set
every
k
miles
or
so
the
fact
that
he
is
replacing
the
muffler
too
is
also
ok
would
other
things
break
down
or
have
to
be
replaced
soon
the
mileage
is
fairly
low
but
typical
fwd
stuff
is
cv
joints
check
the
maintenance
records
with
the
manufacturers
requirements
for
valve
adjustments
timing
belt
changes
and
so
on
the
k
mile
service
is
often
expensive
so
make
sure
he
has
done
everything
the
seller
told
me
that
he
used
the
car
on
the
highway
a
lot
but
i
dont
know
how
to
verify
this
ive
seen
the
paint
chipped
away
in
tiny
dots
in
the
front
edge
of
the
hood
though
well
this
is
one
of
the
commonly
cited
methods
for
identifying
a
car
with
highway
miles
might
check
the
gas
pedal
wear
too
ask
him
how
many
sets
of
tires
he
has
been
through
a
highway
car
might
have
squeezed
by
on
sets
a
hard
driven
car
sets
although
the
maxima
is
an
excellent
car
and
the
car
is
very
clean
and
well
kept
its
currently
out
of
warranty
a
similarly
priced
accord
with
k
km
will
have
years
or
k
km
worth
of
warranty
left
and
i
dont
want
to
worry
about
paying
for
any
repair
bills
well
the
maxima
should
be
pretty
reliable
but
if
its
out
of
warranty
you
should
get
it
checked
out
by
someone
knowledgeable
first
stuff
for
japanese
cars
can
be
expensive
but
i
also
need
a
car
for
people
when
will
the
new
maxima
come
out
by
the
way
model
year
i
believe
i
would
very
much
appreciate
your
input
in
this
please
reply
by
email
preferred
or
post
in
this
newsgroup
craig
thanks
