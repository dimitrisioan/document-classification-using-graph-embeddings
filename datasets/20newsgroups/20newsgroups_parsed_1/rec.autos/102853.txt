honda
accord
brake
problem
my
honda
accord
just
hit
the
magic
mile
mark
and
now
all
sorts
of
things
are
beginning
to
go
bad
the
latest
problem
i
am
experiencing
is
with
my
brakes
they
still
stop
the
car
fine
but
once
i
am
stopped
completely
my
brake
pedal
will
sink
another
or
inches
all
by
itself
if
feels
really
strange
and
i
am
worried
my
brakes
will
quit
working
one
of
these
days
i
checked
my
brake
fluid
and
the
reservoir
was
full
but
the
fluid
itself
looked
really
dirty
like
dirty
oil
i
called
my
mechanic
and
he
told
me
i
need
a
new
brake
master
cylinder
which
will
cost
me
a
whopping
i
was
just
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
has
experienced
this
sort
of
thing
if
so
is
my
mechanic
being
honest
or
do
i
simply
need
to
have
my
brakes
bled
and
new
fluid
put
in
any
help
you
could
provide
would
be
appreciated
please
send
replies
directly
to
me
as
i
rarely
have
a
chance
to
read
this
list
i
will
post
the
responses
if
there
is
any
interest
thanks
