production
hold
on

w
speed
after
a
tip
from
gary
crum
i
got
on
the
phone
with
pontiac
systems
or
pontaic
customer
service
or
whatever
and
inquired
about
a
rumoured
production
hold
on
the
formula
firebird
and
trans
am
btw
talking
with
the
dealer
i
bought
the
car
from
got
me
nowhere
after
being
routed
to
a
firebird
specialist
i
was
able
to
confirm
that
this
is
in
fact
the
case
at
first
there
was
some
problem
with
the
performance
axle
ratio
she
wouldnt
go
into
any
details
so
i
dont
know
if
there
were
some
shipped
that
had
problems
or
if
production
was
held
up
because
they
simply
didnt
have
the
proper
parts
from
the
supplier
as
i
say
she
was
pretty
vague
on
that
so
if
anyone
else
knows
anything
about
this
feel
free
to
respond
supposedly
this
problem
is
now
solved
second
there
is
a
definate
shortage
of
parts
that
is
somehow
related
to
the
sixspeed
manual
transmission
so
as
of
this
posting
there
is
a
production
hold
on
these
cars
she
claimed
part
of
the
delay
was
not
wanting
to
use
inferior
quality
parts
for
the
car
and
therefore
having
to
wait
for
the
right
high
quality
parts
im
not
positive
that
this
applies
to
the
camaro
as
well
but
im
guessing
it
would
can
anyone
else
shed
some
light
on
this
