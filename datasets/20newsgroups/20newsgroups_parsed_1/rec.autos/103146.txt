many

many
times
from

i
have
had
all
the
major
brand
detectors

imho
nothing

even
comes
close

i
hadnt
heard
of
the
valentine
before
cardriver
and
other
auto
magazines
recommend
bel
detectors
i
was
considering
their
latest
the
sti
which
picks
up
super
wideband
ka
and
laser
as
well
it
also
avoids
radar
detector
detectors
although
i
really
dont
care
about
this
since
i

ill
be
driving
in
virginia
anytime
