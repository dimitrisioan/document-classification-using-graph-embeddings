can
anyone
offer
any
opinions
of
the
ford
probe
ala
how
they
do
in
the
long
run
repair
records
reliability
mileage
etc
some
other
owners
on
the
mailing
list
have
commented
about
this
problem
but
i
havent
seen
it
happen
on
my
month
old
probe
gt
i
think
this
may
be
something
that
ford
has
corrected
since
the
initial
batch
of
cars
also
someone
said
that
ford
has
issued
a
service
bulletin
to
inform
dealers
about
how
to
correct
this
problem
so
you
may
be
able
to
get
your
dealer
to
fix
it
i
have
had
my
probe
looked
at
twice
by
my
local
dealer
where
i
purchased
the
car
the
first
time
they
made
this
problem
worse
the
second
time
after
advising
them
of
the
service
bulletin
mentioned
on
my
fordprobe
mailing
list
they
said
they
didnt
know
of
the
bulletin
they
adjusted
the
window
and
made
it
much
better
however
it
now
makes
a
scritch
scritch
noise
on
rough
roads
and
still
squeals
when
i
openclose
the
window
in
wet
weather
anyone
elsess
do
this
ford
only
gives
key
with
the
car
cmon
ford
spend
an
extra
few
pennies
i
got
two
keys
with
my
car
but
only
one
remoteentry
pushbutton
thingie
but
then
i
bought
my
with
miles
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
a
repossession
so
im
not
surprised
something
was
missing
horn
buttons
behind
air
bag
in
spokes
and
not
in
center
personal
preference
i
am
seriously
considering
following
the
advice
in
the
owners
manual
where
it
describes
the
procedure
to
follow
if
you
discover
something
on
your
ford
that
could
cause
serious
injury
threaten
lives
etc
something
about
notifying
the
national
traffic
safety
group
as
well
as
ford
those
little
youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep
buttons
are
terrible
the
latter
is
probably
because
of
the
air
bag
its
pretty
much
takes
up
all
the
space
where
youd
expect
to
find
the
horn
speaking
of
the
horn
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
probe
comes
with
one
of
those
nice
merican
sounding
horns
instead
of
the
japanese
sounding
kind
the
previous
probes
had
japanese
horns
well
i
guess
thats
good
in
a
way
but
in
a
way
its
bad
when
someone
hears
that
kind
of
horn
they
expect
to
see
a
big
american
car
they
may
not
associate
the
sound
with
a
small
jap
car
style
car
like
the
probe
is
tires
fling
dirtmud
onto
side
of
car
yeah
not
very
badly
but
enough
to
be
annoying
sometimes
the
mudflaps
help
a
lot
transmission
the
speed
is
a
must
i
have
always
been
a
speed
guy
almost
every
car
ive
ever
owned
has
been
a
speed
because
i
got
a
good
deal
on
this
car
with
the
miles
i
knowingly
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
has
an
automatic
but
it
is
a
pretty
hightech
automatic
it
is
a
fully
electronicaly
controlled
speed
with
torque
converter
lockup
even
with
the
automatic
im
getting
mpg
on
the
highway
driving
but
of
course
driving
is
illegal
so
i
probably
made
that
sentence
up
around
town
the
mileage
has
been
around
not
bad
for
an
automatic
of
course
it
doesnt
have
the
control
of
a
speed
but
since
i
do
a
lot
of
city
driving
it
turns
out
to
be
very
convenient
its
nice
to
be
able
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
and
drive
at
the
same
time
although
that
too
is
illegal
here
in
weliketocontrolyourlife
massachusetts
no
shakerattle
noises
when
going
over
bumpspotholes
still
shakes
and
rattles
has
been
my
main
gripe
ive
gotten
them
to
fix
the
worst
of
them
but
i
fear
that
with
the
rather
harsh
ride
the
car
will
be
a
virtual
potpouri
of
rattles
when
it
gets
older
tires
vr
goodyear
eagles
left
hoping
for
k
on
my
probe
gl
i
got
about
k
out
of
the
original
goodyears
and
had
driven
the
replacement
tires
bridgestone
k
miles
when
i
tradeed
the
car
the
vr
firestones
on
my
probe
look
like
theyre
designed
for
performance
ie
rather
wide
shallow
tread
etc
so
they
probably
wont
last
as
long
but
the
car
handles
very
very
very
well
it
sticks
to
the
road
like
glue
even
on
a
rough
surface
interior
is
very
very
nice
too
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
ergonomically
sound
definitely
fordmazda
did
a
very
very
nice
job
on
this
one
the
car
has
a
much
more
expensive
than
it
actually
is
look
and
feel
to
it
yes
this
cars
stiff
suspension
isnt
for
everyone
i
personally
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
little
harsh
but
otherwise
like
the
car
id
strongly
suggest
looking
into
the
mx
having
driven
an
probe
for
years
i
find
the
suspension
interesting
the
car
actually
drives
much
better
than
the
it
is
a
very
firm
ride
and
you
definitely
know
about
each
and
every
bump
in
the
road
yet
the
car
remains
very
civilized
on
even
the
bumpiest
roads
you
hear
and
feel
the
bumps
yet
the
car
retains
its
posture
very
well
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
well
i
wouldnt
encourage
passengercarrying
in
the
probe
unless
the
person
in
the
front
seat
likes
to
sit
with
his
knees
to
the
dash
as
mentioned
in
the
consumer
reports
writeups
consider
the
back
seat
as
a
parcel
shelf
no
biggie
to
me
though
if
it
had
been
id
not
have
bought
the
car
but
its
definitely
not
a
family
car
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
ac
is
a
must
on
any
probe
from
the
in
particular
sends
out
a
real
blast
of
cool
air
when
the
ac
is
on
max
that
lots
of
glass
you
mentioned
is
what
gives
the
car
the
very
good
visibility
reports
you
see
in
all
the
writeups
most
sportssporty
cars
dont
have
that
good
visibility
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
i
havent
heard
about
this
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
very
early
probes
and
maybe
had
problems
with
prematurely
rusting
mufflers
which
the
complaints
ive
heard
re
exhaust
system
on
s
have
been
on
the
gt
of
course
being
a
different
engine
that
is
a
differeent
exhaust
system
i
was
one
of
those
with
an
who
qualified
for
the
free
replacement
since
i
had
already
replaced
the
muffler
when
i
received
the
notice
i
wasam
due
a
refund
from
ford
i
applied
in
february
and
am
still
waiting
gave
me
a
free
rental
car
for
the
day
and
a
half
that
i
was
without
my
car
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
way
they
handledespecially
considering
that
i
was
expecting
the
worst
from
them
yes
i
was
pretty
amazed
when
i
had
my
car
in
for
some
touchup
adjustments
this
past
week
and
they
had
to
keep
it
overnight
too
busy
for
them
to
get
to
it
and
they
offered
to
pay
for
a
rental
they
did
make
me
pay
for
taxes
and
insurance
though
from
what
ive
heard
it
sounds
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problems
with
the
probe
and
probably
mx
when
they
first
went
into
production
but
i
think
these
problems
have
mostly
been
corrected
at
this
point
thats
almost
always
to
be
expected
with
a
completely
new
car
like
this
though
i
have
to
agree
that
they
seem
to
have
some
qc
problesm
but
i
seriously
feel
the
car
design
is
sound
and
expect
it
to
do
very
well
