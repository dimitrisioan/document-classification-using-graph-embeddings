illegal
tint
windows
i
know
its
a
long
shot
but
maybe
someone
went
through
this
and
will
have
some
comments
to
share
the
story
is
this
i
bought
a
car
out
of
state
and
im
trying
to
get
the
safety
inspection
in
pennsylvania
the
problem
is
that
the
car
has
aftermarket
tint
on
all
windows
except
the
windshield
the
tint
is
rather
weak
and
you
can
clearly
see
the
inside
of
the
car
through
the
tint
the
inspection
garage
said
that
they
wont
pass
it
unless
i
get
a
waiver
from
the
state
police
so
i
went
to
the
state
police
the
officer
told
me
that
aftermarket
tint
is
illegal
and
i
can
get
a
waiver
only
for
a
pre
car
or
for
a
medical
reason
i
asked
him
to
show
me
the
section
of
the
vehicle
code
that
says
its
illegal
he
showed
it
to
me
and
the
paraghaph
said
that
you
cant
have
tint
if
you
cant
see
the
inside
of
the
car
because
of
the
tint
when
i
told
him
that
you
can
in
fact
see
the
inside
very
well
he
shut
the
book
and
said
its
just
illegal
and
in
fact
we
can
have
someone
give
you
a
ticket
for
it
right
now
well
wont
argue
with
that
since
the
vehicle
code
says
its
ok
as
long
as
you
can
see
through
the
tint
id
like
to
keep
it
ill
reread
the
vehicle
code
in
the
library
id
also
like
to
get
some
sort
of
paper
from
the
police
that
says
its
ok
so
i
can
get
the
inspection
and
so
that
i
wont
get
in
trouble
for
the
tint
later
on
i
also
wouldnt
mind
registering
a
complaint
against
that
officer
he
really
pissed
me
off
so
does
anyone
have
any
experience
getting
that
sort
of
a
paper
from
the
police
especially
in
pennsylvania
does
anyone
have
any
experience
registering
a
complaint
against
an
officer
i
called
the
station
later
on
today
but
they
basically
said
there
is
no
place
where
i
could
register
a
complaint
against
an
officer
and
if
i
do
decide
to
keep
the
tint
and
get
a
ticket
anyway
how
much
of
a
chance
do
i
stand
to
succesfully
appeal
the
ticket
in
court
any
comments
about
it
will
be
welcome
