nx
vs
sentra
ser
im
plannig
to
trade
my
sentra
ser
in
with
a
nx
my
car
has
miles
on
it
and
is
a
model
the
nx
the
dealer
is
selling
is
a
model
with
miles
on
it
it
has
a
tbar
roof
ac
and
an
airbag
which
my
sentra
does
not
have
they
are
asking
for
is
that
a
fair
deal
the
only
thing
i
noticed
about
the
nx
is
that
the
engine
did
not
seem
to
have
as
much
torque
as
my
sentra
which
has
the
same
identical
engine
i
presume
that
the
last
lady
owner
did
not
really
push
the
engine
to
its
limits
occassionaly
while
i
did
that
on
mine
thuis
the
nxs
engine
is
a
little
tight
so
if
i
buy
the
nx
and
excercise
it
well
should
that
slight
power
problem
go
away
any
advice
on
this
will
be
much
appreciated
thanks
please
reply

email

possible
