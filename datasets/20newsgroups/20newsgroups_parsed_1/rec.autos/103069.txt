the

his
name
tacked
in
here
my
wife
has
informed
me
that
she
wants
a
convertible
for
her
next
car
i
was
about
to
recommend
you
consider
a
targa
top
over
a
convertible
but
drew
made
the
point
very
well
when
my
wife
and
i
were
in
our
s
we
did
the
convertible
thing
with
triumphs
now
in
our
mids
we
still
appreciate
the
open
air
but
prefer
targa
types
there
is
much
less
wind
noise
objectspapers
blowing
around
foreign
objects
getting
into
the
car
and
one
still
has
almost
all
the
advantages
of
the
convertible
tom
while
its
being
mentioned
i
personally
prefer
the
moonroofsunroofttop
targa
thing
as
well
i
simply
dont
like
cloth
tops
nor
the
extra
insurance
nor
the
s
color
matching
alot
of
companies
do
if
i
chose
a
convertible
itd
be
a
mazda
rx
ii
i
just
like
the
way
they
look
itd
have
to
be
in
black
with
color
matched
black
topthey
look
good
b
vw
cabriolet
they
do
a
suberb
job
of
matching
colors
too
also
last
year
for
them
