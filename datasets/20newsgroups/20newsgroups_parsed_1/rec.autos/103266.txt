i
figure
that
mph
collisions
into
brick
walls
arent
common
enough
for
me
to
spend
that
much
extra
money
for
protection
but
there
are
lots
of
lowspeed
collisions
that
do
worry
me
get
into
an
mph
accident
and
you
may
reconsider
ive
been
in
one
and
it
is
really
scarey
my
life
is
something
i
value
more
than
a
cars
looks
or
handeling
consider
it
insurance
it
may
not
happen
often
but
when
it
does
youll
sure
be
glad
you
got
a
safe
car
granted
the
tests
arent
perfect
but
id
much
rather
be
in
a
car
that
did
well
in
the
test
than
a
car
that
did
horribly
you
raise
a
valid
point
but
again
its
a
tradeoff
how
much
money
do
you
want
to
spend
for
that
kind
of
protection
you
could
buy
a
volvo
saab
or
benz
and
get
really
good
crash
protection
and
other
luxuries
but
youll
pay
significantly
more
for
it
in
my
case
its
out
of
the
question
because
all
of
those
cars
are
beyond
my
budget
ive
been
in
two
major
auto
accidents
both
were
multiple
car
the
worst
was
a
headon
three
car
collision
t
intersection
and
one
person
ran
a
stop
sign
in
both
cases
i
was
stopped
and
had
no
place
to
go
and
i
saw
it
coming
both
times
even
in
highspeed
headon
collisions
the
most
beneficial
item
you
can
have
is
a
good
old
point
seatbelt
nowadays
at
least
in
the
us
you
get
an
airbag
if
you
get
a
point
belt
so
presumably
you
get
an
added
safety
benefit
there
as
well
thats
something
i
certainly
look
for
and
which
can
be
had
in
inexpensive
cars
if
you
really
want
to
add
safety
to
any
car
simply
add
a
cage
to
the
car
they
are
available
and
cheap
about
in
the
usa
add
to
that
four
or
five
or
six
point
belts
and
you
will
walk
away
from
collisions
that
were
otherwise
not
survivable
but
instead
of
people
spending
a
little
extra
money
we
get
legislation
that
says
the
govt
must
mandate
a
minimal
level
of
protection
for
everyone
one
other
significant
factor
in
improving
ones
own
safety
is
to
get
some
training
this
will
improve
your
safety
more
than
any
other
single
investment
will
driveride
defensively
and
that
does
not
mean
you
have
to
be
a
doddering
old
stick
in
the
mud
people
here
tend
to
enthuse
about
autos
more
than
the
average
probably
in
the
top
th
percentile
in
driving
ability
but
still
we
sometimes
overlook
the
obvious
ive
been
to
two
driving
schools
and
three
riding
schools
for
my
motorcycle
a
very
worthwhile
investment
and
besides
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
too
safety
is
what
you
make
of
it
just
because
a
carmaker
doesnt
provide
you
with
an
adequate
level
of
protection
doesnt
mean
you
have
to
leave
it
go
