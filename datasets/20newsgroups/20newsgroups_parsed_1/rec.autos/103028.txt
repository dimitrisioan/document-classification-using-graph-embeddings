simple
in
principle
porous
adsorbents
like
zeolite
and
activated
carbon
can
adsorb
gases
evaporated
from
the
adsorbate
water
or
methanol
etc
giving
the
cooling
effect
upon
being
heated
the
gassaturated
adsorbent
bed
will
give
off
the
gases
which
are
then
to
be
condensed
this
forms
the
adsorption
refrigeration
cycle
the
only
problem
is
that
