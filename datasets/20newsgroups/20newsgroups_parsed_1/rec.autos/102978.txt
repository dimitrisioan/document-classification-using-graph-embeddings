hello
netters
im
visiting
the
us
im
from
sweden
in
august
i
will
probably
rent
a
chevy
beretta
from
alamo
ive
been
quoted
for
a
week
for
additional
days
this
would
include
free
driving
distance
but
not
local
taxes
baltimore
they
also
told
me
all
insurance
thats
necessary
is
included
but
i
doubt
that
cause
a
friend
rented
a
car
last
year
and
it
turned
out
he
needed
a
lot
more
insurance
than
whats
included
in
the
base
price
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didnt
rent
it
from
alamo
does
anyone
have
some
info
on
this
is
a
ripoff
no
that
sounds
pretty
reasonable
for
that
car
and
that
city
probability
that
ill
be
needing
more
insurance
unless
you
have
an
accident
you
wont
need
more
if
you
plan
on
paying
for
the
car
with
a
credit
card
check
and
see
if
your
card
automatically
covers
rental
cars
also
your
own
auto
insurance
may
cover
rental
cars
also
most
rental
companies
here
offer
extra
insurance
when
you
rent
and
require
you
to
initial
in
several
spots
if
you
dont
want
it
the
credit
cards
and
personal
auto
insurance
provide
the
same
sort
of
coverage
that
the
rental
agency
is
trying
to
sell
i
have
never
rented
from
alamo
so
i
dont
know
if
they
follow
this
same
practice
is
the
beretta
a
good
rental
car
yes
it
is
a
compact
door
probably
a
bit
dull
performance
and
accelerationwise
but
very
adequate
it
will
have
an
automatic
transmission
amfm
stereo
air
conditioning
and
possibly
power
windows
and
door
locks
