re
integra
gsr
quad
reliable
yeah
whats
your
definition
of
reliable
if
thats
reliable
then
its
safe
to
say
that
integra
engines
in
general
are
near
perfect
not
to
mention
a
hell
of
alot
smoother
and
quieter
balance
shaftsthe
acura
has
the
engine
wins
the
reliablity
contest
hands
down
you
can
rev
that
car
all
day
everyday
and
youll
never
blow
a
hose
or
crack
the
block
or
anything
else
i
speak
from
expierence
im
not
saying
the
quad
is
a
bad
engine
but
dont
highlight
reliability
when
you
comparing
it
to
a
acura
engine
and
while
the
integra
costs
alot
more
it
is
a
a
couple
of
things
blowing
a
hose
doesnt
speak
of
engine
reliability
and
while
it
is
true
that
quads
have
a
problem
with
head
gasket
leaks
that
was
a
design
flaw
in
the
gasket
and
has
been
corrected
also
i
know
pontiac
is
replacing
head
gaskets
that
leak
for
free
for
yeark
miles
other
than
that
i
have
found
my
quad
to
be
completely
solid
and
the
direct
ignition
system
means
no
wiresrotorrotorcap
to
ever
deal
with
also
hydrolic
lifters
mean
no
valve
adjustments
ever
im
not
badmouthing
the
integra
engine
i
just
think
you
are
going
overboard
on
slamming
the
quad
you
are
quite
correct
that
the
integra
engine
is
quieter
although
i
would
not
say
smoother
my
quad
loves
to
rev
especially
at
the
highend
do
you
have
any
evidence
of
blocks
cracking
on
quads
i
have
not
heard
of
this
