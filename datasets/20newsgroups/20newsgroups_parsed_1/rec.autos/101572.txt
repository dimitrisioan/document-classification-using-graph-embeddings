a
rund
writes
apparently
youre
not
a
woman
my
husband
hates
the
auto
door
locks
features
but
forgets
that
besides
families
with
children
a
woman
feels
safer
in
a
car
that
locks
easily
in
addition
to
watching
around
checking
out
if
anyones
near
me
when
i
get
to
my
car
never
park
in
a
secluded
spot
etc
have
my
keys
ready
to
open
the
door
so
im
not
fumbling
in
my
purse
looking
for
them
this
has
me
thinking
is
there
a
biological
reason
why
women
cant
put
their
keys
in
their
pants
pockets
like
men
do
i
have
two
pockets
on
the
back
of
each
of
my
pants
i
put
my
keys
in
one
and
wallent
in
another
many
of
the
pockets
even
have
a
botton
on
them
so
i
can
close
them
securely
everything
is
that
much
simpler
for
me
why
cant
women
do
the
same
is
is
biological
ie
not
enough
room
for
a
bigger
bottom
plus
keys
and
a
wallet
or
is
it
the
way
they
are
raised
by
the
parents
