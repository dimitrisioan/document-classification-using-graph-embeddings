im
considering
switching
to
geico
insurance
but
have
heard
that
they
do
not
assign
a
specific
agent
for
each
policy
or
claim
i
was
worried
that
this
might
be
a
real
pain
when
you
make
a
claim
i
have
also
heard
that
they
try
to
get
rid
of
you
if
you
have
an
accident
im
interestend
in
determining
whether
or
not
these
things
are
true
has
anyone
out
there
with
geico
made
a
claim
id
be
interested
in
hearing
whether
or
not
you
were
satisfied
with
the
service
and
whether
you
then
had
trouble
renewing
your
policy
im
also
interested
in
any
good
or
bad
stories
about
liberty
mutual
or
state
farm
stay
away
from
geico
a
recent
car
driver
issue
has
an
article
about
geico
giving
free
laser
guns
to
police
departments
to
increase
theyre
speed
limit
enforcement
the
article
also
said
that
if
you
get
a
speeding
ticket
your
premium
will
increase
dramatically
based
on
how
much
over
the
limit
you
were
if
i
remember
correctly
at
more
than
over
youll
get
something
like
a
increase
if
you
have
a
radar
detector
you
will
be
denied
coverage
or
dropped
immediately
one
accident
claim
and
you
will
be
dropped
after
many
years
with
geico
my
father
who
had
tickets
and
had
made
claims
had
an
accident
and
filed
an
claim
he
was
dropped
immediately
since
then
he
has
been
with
state
farm
for
years
with
no
complaints
i
have
been
with
state
farm
for
about
years
no
complaints
