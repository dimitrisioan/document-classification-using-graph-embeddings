re
its
a
rush
was
re
too
fast
remember
roads
in
america
are
not
designed
for
speeds
above
meaning
they
would
be
safe
at
roads
like
the
autobahn
are
smoother
straiter
wider
and
slightly
banked
example
a
few
months
back
i
was
traveling
late
at
night
am
or
so
and
i
was
changing
highways
at
a
bent
crosssing
it
curved
off
to
the
south
east
becoming
hidden
by
trees
after
about
ft
and
continued
to
the
left
strait
north
i
wanted
to
turn
north
checked
the
south
lane
rolled
into
the
crossing
and
checked
the
north
lane
nevertheless
there
wasnt
a
car
in
sight
so
i
took
one
last
look
and
pulled
into
the
left
hand
lane
now
my
car
isnt
a
sec
performer
but
i
was
in
the
corect
lane
and
over
in
decent
time
even
at
i
wasnt
wasting
time
it
was
then
that
i
checked
my
mirror
and
saw
a
mustang
closing
in
my
lane
fast
he
had
just
turned
the
corner
and
was
just
noticing
me
luckly
he
saw
me
and
changed
lanes
in
time
i
estamate
he
was
moving
in
excess
of
or
so
i
was
just
a
by
stander
i
had
no
chance
of
runing
from
him
or
moving
out
of
his
way
im
glad
he
saw
my
brake
lights
in
time
i
shudder
to
think
of
what
would
have
happened
had
i
wainted
to
pull
out
and
not
left
the
time
he
needed
to
dodge
me
rule
just
because
your
car
can
do
and
your
way
is
clear
dont
assume
it
will
stay
that
way
travis
disclamer
the
ideas
expressed
above
are
in
fact
the
same
as
my
employer
since
i
have
none
email
flame
at
