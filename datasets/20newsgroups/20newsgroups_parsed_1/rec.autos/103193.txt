history
of
the

between
and
the
instrument
pannel
of
the
car
has
been
replaced
and
the
odometer
also
has
been
reset
to

therefore
the
true
meter
reading
is
the

current
mileage

shows
mile
difference
comparing
to
the
mileage
on
the

appreciated
thanks
something
that
happened
in
south
africa
about
a
year
ago
a
dealer
sold
a
mercedes
with
an
odometer
reading
of
k
kilometers
to
a
lady
turned
out
that
the
actual
reading
should
have
been
k
court
case
followed
because
lady
said
she
wouldnt
have
bought
a
car
with
that
much
kms
dealer
found
quilty
fined
and
had
to
take
back
the
car
i
think
you
have
a
case
if
you
can
get
a
sworn
statement
from
the
previous
owner
take
the
car
back
to
the
dealer
and
threaten
him
or
something
gerrit
