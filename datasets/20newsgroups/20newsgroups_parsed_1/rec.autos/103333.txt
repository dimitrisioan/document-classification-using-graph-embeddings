on
the
subject
of
the
upcoming
new
mustang
i
do
not
put
much
stock
in
the
mag
rags
inside
information
or
even
ford
rep
quotes
the
taurus
was
pretty
much
a
surprise
when
it
was
finally
disclosed
in
its
entirety
inside
information
had
the
taurus
with
a
v
and
rearwheel
drive
at
one
point
i
wouldnt
look
for
a
simple
repaneled
mustang
folks
you
may
be
cheating
yourself
if
you
do
theres
a
lot
of
potential
ford
hasnt
released
a
new
car
without
a
wheel
is
in
years
the
mustang
project
has
been
brewing
for
at
least
right
a
wheel
is
could
happen
those
modular
vs
are
out
there
too
in
the
interest
of
cafe
and
competition
dont
rule
those
out
either
your
ignorant
if
you
do
and
there
are
so
many
spy
shots
and
artist
renderings
out
there
who
really
knows
what
itll
look
like
the
mach
iii
doubt
it
highly
the
next
mustang
will
be
fords
highest
profile
car
it
attracts
way
more
attention
than
the
camarofirebird
because
its
heritage
is
more
embedded
in
the
general
public
dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believe
ford
will
forfeit
that
the
car
magazines
have
printed
a
lot
of
information
about
the
new
mustang
and
the
consensus
about
what
to
believe
in
my
car
circle
is
that
the
suspension
pieces
and
tuning
will
be
almost
identical
to
the
current
cobra
but
on
a
stiffer
body
structure
which
will
improve
its
behavior
after
the
mn
thunderbird
cost
and
weight
debacle
ford
decided
independent
rear
suspension
with
rear
wheel
drive
wont
be
tried
again
in
a
volume
car
the
current
l
v
will
soldier
on
for
about
two
years
a
version
of
the
valve
modular
v
in
the
mark
viii
could
be
offered
then
ford
is
spending
big
money
tooling
up
for
l
and
l
v
engines
which
will
power
most
of
their
cars
in
the
immediate
future
and
therefore
probably
do
not
consider
volume
production
of
hp
v
engines
a
priority
undisguised
the
car
looks
ok
but
not
nearly
as
exciting
as
the
new
camarofirebird
imo
i
suspect
ford
will
produce
their
car
with
higher
quality
than
gm
will
achieve
with
the
camaro
firebird
the
way
gm
loses
money
the
temptation
to
just
get
them
out
the
door
for
the
sake
of
positive
cash
flow
will
be
great
once
demand
really
takes
off
