my
technique
is
to
ease
back
off
the
throttle
and
at
the
same
time
gently
wrist
back
on
the
shift
lever
if
for
some
reason
i
miss
the
shift
window
i
lightly
press
the
accelerator
try
agian
ive
found
that
clutchless
shifting
is
eaiserquicker
at
high
rpms
i
also
skip
gears
some
times
using
sounds
about
right
i
usually
slip
it
out
during
throttledown
and
then
blip
the
throttle
and
wait
until
it
feels
like
things
are
right
usually
about
a
second
and
then
slip
it
into
gear
so
how
did
you
guys
learn
this
is
it
something
you
were
born
with
or
did
you
make
horrible
grinding
noises
the
first
few
times
how
many
times
i
would
think
youd
have
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
feel
for
it
to
begin
with
some
people
would
never
get
it
and
others
like
me
would
never
have
the
guts
to
try
it
unless
maybe
you
were
planning
to
buy
a
new
transmission
anyway
btw
ive
heard
that
quite
a
few
truckers
and
race
car
drivers
shift
this
way
