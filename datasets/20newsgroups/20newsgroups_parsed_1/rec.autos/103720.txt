im
not
familiar
with
the
trannies
used
in
winston
cup
but
in
the
transam
cars
ive
played
with
the
transmissions
were
the
racing
variety
with
dog
clutches
instead
of
sychros
in
a
transmission
with
dog
clutches
the
gears
are
always
engaged
with
each
other
and
moving
the
dog
clutches
engages
the
gears
to
the
shafts
motorcycle
transmissions
are
the
same
way
shifting
without
the
clutch
on
a
transmission
with
syncros
can
and
will
cause
transmission
damage
the
only
question
being
how
long
it
takesto
grenade
something
for
the
trans
in
my
pulsar
se
it
was
about
k
miles
but
it
had
a
weak
tranny
in
the
first
place
just
out
of
curiosity
how
is
this
dog
clutch
any
different
from
a
synchro
transmission
what
you
described
sounds
the
same
to
me
in
fact
what
little
ive
studied
on
trannies
the
instructor
referred
to
the
synchros
as
dogs
and
said
they
were
synonymous
the
gears
are
always
meshed
in
a
synchronized
gearbox
and
you
slip
the
synchro
gears
back
and
forth
by
shifting
or
at
least
that
is
what
i
was
taught
explain
por
favour
thanx
drew
ps
emails
fine
if
this
is
inappropriate
for
here
or
if
im
the
only
bonhead
who
doesnt
know
the
diff
