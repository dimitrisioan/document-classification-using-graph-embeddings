re
waxing
a
new
car
i
just
had
my
chrysler
painted
i
was
told
to
refrain
from
waxing
it
and
to
leave
it
out
in
the
sun
supposedly
this
lets
the
volatiles
escape
from
the
paint
over
a
month
or
so
i
can
smell
it
feet
away
on
a
hot
day
and
lets
any
slight
irregularites
in
the
surface
flow
out
as
the
paint
remains
a
little
soft
for
a
while
