question
in
article
writes
the
taurus
sho
for
those
who
can
get
it
straight
it
is
sho
as
in
super
high
output
not
sho
as
in

sho
v
having
spoken
to
technical
staff
from
ford
many
times
i
can
assure
you
that
internally
at
ford
this
car
is
always
called
the
taurus
show
or
just
the
show
as
in
long
o
sound
i
still
refer
to
it
as
the
sho
however
because
it
sounds
better
to
me
i
assume
many
purist
fans
and
owners
prefer
using
the
