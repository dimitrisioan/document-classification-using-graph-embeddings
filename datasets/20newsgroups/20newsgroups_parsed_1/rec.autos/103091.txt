is
there
going
to
be
a
bmw
in
could
be
isnt
the
liter
six
supposed
to
be
enlarged
to
liters
in
the
nottoodistant
future
makes
sense
since
the
new
mercedes
benz
engines
go
from
l
to
a
l
nothing
in
between
btw
i
beleive
the
numbers
on
those
mb
engines
are
and
hp
respectively
the
oneupmanship
in
hp
might
induce
bmw
to
create
a
larger
six
also
the
e
has
lagged
behind
the
er
for
some
time
wrt
hp
i
am
sure
the
bavarians
wouldnt
want
to
be
shownup
by
the
schwabians
ps
those
mb
engines
havent
been
released
over
here
yet
