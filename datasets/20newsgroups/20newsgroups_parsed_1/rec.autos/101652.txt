in
your
experience
how
true
is
it
that
a
fuel
injector
cleaning
will
do
much
more
good
than
just
using
detergent
gas
while
i
a
fuel
injector
cleaning
at
the
dealer
is
probably
little
more
than
them
opening
your
gas
tank
dumping
in
a
bottle
of
fuel
injector
cleaner
and
sending
you
on
your
merry
way
poorer
go
to
kmart
and
buy
the
cleaner
yourself
for
this
should
not
be
the
case
if
they
are
at
all
reputable
fuel
injector
cleaning
is
done
properly
with
a
can
of
injector
cleaner
solvent
which
is
hooked
up
to
the
fuel
system
under
high
pressure
the
car
is
actually
run
on
the
solvent
during
the
cleaning
process
the
equipment
to
properly
do
this
is
pricey
and
generally
not
something
the
average
home
mechanic
has
the
solvent
itself
is
not
very
expensive
and
you
could
probably
make
up
a
hose
to
fit
your
system
and
do
it
yourself
but
i
didnt
tell
you
that
not
many
intank
cleaners
are
worth
wasting
your
money
on
there
has
been
a
discussion
of
these
products
on
here
from
time
to
time
and
chevron
techron
not
progard
with
techron
is
generally
regarded
as
the
best
it
is
however
a
bit
more
than
a
bottle
imho
it
will
not
substitute
for
proper
injector
cleaning
if
they
are
really
crudded
up
youll
have
to
decide
if
the
price
is
a
better
deal
than
spending
your
time
andor
buying
equipment
to
do
it
