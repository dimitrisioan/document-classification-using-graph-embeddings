if
im
not
mistaken
altering
the
odometer
is
illegal
furthermore
i
surmise
itll
be
tough
to
alter
bmws
odometer
if
you
got
at
it
some
of
the
newer
bmws
have
electronic
odometers
making
it
even
more
tamperproof
on
the
cars
mentioned
series
from
the
late
s
the
electronic
odometer
is
really
a
mechanical
drum
type
odometer
that
is
driven
by
pulses
from
a
speed
sensor
on
the
rear
axle
these
pulses
are
converted
into
mechanical
pulses
that
turn
the
odometer
and
speedometer
no
way
changing
or
erasing
an
eprom
is
going
to
change
the
mileage
reading
it
also
means
the
odometer
is
just
as
easy
or
hard
to
change
as
any
other
mechanical
odometer
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
bit
easier
to
disconnect
the
speed
sensor
and
run
the
car
with
no
speedometer
or
odometer
readinga
simple
switch
will
do
the
job
it
also
will
disable
the
speed
limiter
which
will
enable
the
car
to
reach
its
full
speed
