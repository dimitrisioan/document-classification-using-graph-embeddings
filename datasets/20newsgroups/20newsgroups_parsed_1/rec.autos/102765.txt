unfortunately
ive
got
another
story
to
add
to
this
my
girlfriend
and
i
were
driving
through
west
la
and
got
pelted
by
a
rock
just
as
we
were
pulling
away
from
a
stoplight
the
scary
thing
was
that
the
rock
was
heavy
enough
to
put
a
decentsized
dent
in
the
door
of
my
riviera
which
is
pretty
much
solid
detriot
iron
couple
of
inches
higher
and
it
would
have
gone
through
the
window
