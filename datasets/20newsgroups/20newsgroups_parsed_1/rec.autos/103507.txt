my
wife
and
i
looked
at
and
drove
one
last
fall
this
was
a
model
it
was
wayyyyyyyyy
underpowered
i
could
not
imagine
driving
it
in
the
mountains
here
in
colorado
at
anything
approaching
highway
speeds
i
have
read
that
the
new
models
have
a
newer
improved
hp
engine
im
quite
serious
that
i
laughed
in
the
salesman
face
when
he
said
once
its
broken
in
it
will
feel
more
powerful
i
had
been
used
to
driving
a
jeep
l
hp
engine
i
believe
the
s
land
cruisers
land
yachts
were
l
the
sames
as
the
runner
which
is
also
underpowered
in
my
own
personal
opinion
they
are
big
cars
very
roomy
but
nothing
spectacular

i
love
animals
they
taste
delicious
the
land
cruiser
has
a
l
engine
which
has
hp
and
torgue
when
i
drove
it
here
in
california
power
is
more
than
enough
the
high
price
is
the
only
reason
i
did
not
buy
it
