cup
holders
driving
is
an
importantant
enough
undertaking
this
is
a
good
idea
so
you
can
carry
your
nonalcoholic
drinks
without
spilling
or
having
someone
hold
on
to
them
i
agree
six
hour
long
stretches
behind
the
wheel
really
make
me
thirsty
especially
for
something
with
caffeine
i
consider
it
a
failing
of
my
car
that
it
has
no
cup
holder
nor
anywhere
to
put
a
cup
holder
