what
car
are
we
talking
about
if
its
camaro
chevellegto
nova
etc
there
are
a
bunch
of
places
to
get
them
a
corvette
but
i
dont
want
to
put
corvette
seats
in
it
the
original
seats
are
in
exc
shape
but
they
are
uncomfortable
as
hell
im
going
to
store
those
and
find
a
set
to
drive
in
i
have
all
the
vette
catalogs
but
im
looking
for
a
more
generic
type
seat
i
can
modify
the
brackets
but
cushion
height
and
overall
width
are
a
concern
ive
looked
through
some
local
boneyards
without
success
i
would
just
like
to
find
a
pair
of
cheapos
to
use
this
summer
