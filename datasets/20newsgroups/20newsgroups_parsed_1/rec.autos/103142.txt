re
saturn
extended
warranty
i
agree
with
gaia
even
though
the
saturn
has
proved
to
be
a
very
reliable
car
so
far
a
little
money
spent
now
is
worth
the
peace
of
mind
in
my
opinion
getting
the
powertrain
warranty
is
enough
in
my
case
thats
be
cause
anything
that
needed
repairing
in
the
interior
sunroof
windows
doors
etc
i
could
do
myself
i
just
didnt
want
to
mess
with
the
engine
and
such
plus
i
think
the
extra
years
of
hour
roadside
assistance
must
be
worthe
so
meting
i
opted
for
the
year
plan
for
thomas
