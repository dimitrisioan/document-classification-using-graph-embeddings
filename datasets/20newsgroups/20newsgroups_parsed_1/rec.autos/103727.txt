re
changing
brake
fluidis
it
necessary
i
agree
with
jeffs
reply
ive
never
changed
the
brake
fluid
except
when
having
a
brake
job
which
is
usually
at
around
miles
alot
of
freeway
driving
however
i
will
start
to
do
this
as
preventative
maintenance
on
my
new
car
also
there
are
brake
system
flushing
agents
that
can
be
used
but
the
problem
is
that
if
any
of
the
agent
is
left
in
the
system
it
can
cause
problems
so
its
been
recommended
not
to
use
them
unless
you
are
certain
that
you
can
remove
all
of
the
flushing
agent
just
for
your
info
i
was
quoted
a
price
of
labor
and
fluid
for
flushing
the
brake
system
this
in
conjunction
with
a
break
job
so
i
dont
know
if
it
was
more
without
the
brake
job
this
is
in
the
sf
bay
area
