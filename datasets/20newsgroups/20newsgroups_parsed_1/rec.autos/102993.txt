im
in
the
market
for
a
new
car
currently
i
own
a
mazda
mx
dx
which
has
served
me
just
fine
however
id
like
to
get
a
door
car
since
i
dont
relish
the
thought
of
moving
a
carseat
around
in
a
door
car
my
criteria
are
door
ac
amfm
cassette
quick
acceleration
cruise
control
decent
rear
seat
legroom
my
husband
is
a
footer
it
must
also
be
under
k
preferably
closer
to
the
k
range
which
will
probably
rule
out
the
accord
the
cars
that
have
caught
my
eye
are
toyota
corolla
toyata
camry
mazda
pontiac
grand
am
pontiac
grand
prix
honda
accord
and
civic
if
its
roomy
enough
and
still
comes
in
a
door
model
hyundai
sonata
and
maybe
even
a
small
oldsmobile
although
not
the
achieva
all
opinions
benchmarks
recommendations
etc
are
welcome
i
really
wouldnt
consider
the
grand
amacheviaskylark
all
the
same
since
they
are
very
bad
in
frontal
collsions
and
dont
have
any
other
really
outstanding
qualities
john
i
really
must
object
to
that
last
statement
having
a
lot
of
experience
with
a
grand
am
coupe
i
can
firmly
state
that
they
do
have
a
lot
of
outstanding
qualities
very
reliable
throughout
great
layout
of
controls
and
components
very
roomy
considering
the
exterior
size
of
the
car
they
look
sharp
inside
and
out
the
v
that
i
drive
has
exceptional
power
and
drivability
compared
to
other
similar
cars
that
i
have
driven
all
in
all
its
a
funtodrive
dependable
and
reasonably
priced
vehicle
please
dont
knock
it
with
a
statement
like
that
unless
you
back
it
up
with
specific
reasons
why
you
feel
that
way

the
renaissance
was
just
something
that
happened
to
other
people
wasnt
