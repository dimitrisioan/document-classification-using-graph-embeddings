its
great
that

youve
got
to
ask
yourself
one
question
do
all
these
other
cars
have
a
moonroof
with
a
sliding
sunshade
no
wimpy
popup
sunroofs
or
power
sliding
roofs
that
are
opaque
a
moonroof
that
can
be
opened
to
the
air
closed
to
let
just
light
in
or
shaded
so
that
nothing
comes
in
youve
just
got
to
know
whats
important
