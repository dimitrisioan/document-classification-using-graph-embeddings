r
goldstein
sez
as
the
subject
says
i
am
moving
from
mass
to
calif
and
will
be
driving
mostly
on
interstate
any
advice
from
folks
who
have
done
it
before
plan
your
gas
stops
in
majorcity
areas
to
avoid
the
centpergallon
only
gas
station
for
miles
and
youre
an
outoftowner
surcharge
prepare
your
car
dont
forget
things
like
your
fuel
air
filters
if
youre
loading
your
car
up
consider
putting
your
spare
on
top
of
your
stuff
just
in
case
of
a
flat
in
my
xcountry
trip
a
tire
disintegrated
in
the
california
desert
it
took
me
minutes
to
unload
all
my
stuff
to
get
to
the
tire
if
you
have
a
hatchback
cover
all
your
stuff
with
a
white
bedsheet
to
help
keep
the
stuff
and
your
car
cool
as
well
as
possibly
avoiding
theft
mcdonalds
have
good
clean
bathrooms
invest
in
a
cb
magnetic
roof
antenna
it
may
help
if
youre
stranded
and
you
can
always
ask
people
for
places
to
stop
for
food
etc
many
times
police
like
to
hang
out
in
the
st
miles
after
you
enter
a
new
state
to
catch
all
the
speeders
who
have
escaped
the
previous
state
same
as
above
when
you
enter
a
mph
city
zone
after
hours
and

of
