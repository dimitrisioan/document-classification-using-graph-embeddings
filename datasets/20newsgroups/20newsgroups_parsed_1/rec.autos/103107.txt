once
wrote
about
the
s
blazer
that
it
shook
and
rattled
like
a
tired
taxi
cab
there
is
one
noise
that
is
expecially
irritating
the
back
window
squeaks
i
believe
its
because
the
whole
tailgate
assembly
and
window
are
not
solid
anyway
has
anyone
had
the
same
problem
and
have
you
found
any
fixes
i
can
relate
to
this
ive
tried
everything
on
my
greasing
every
point
wd
etc
grease
on
the
two
cheap
hinges
on
the
tailgate
seems
to
quiet
it
down
for
a
time
until
the
grease
works
out
of
the
hinges
hinge
pins
appear
to
be
made
out
of
penny
nails
another
vibration
seems
to
get
worse
with
age
and
that
is
a
vibration
in
the
transmission
in
th
gear
my
s
has
k
miles
on
it
i
bought
it
new
treated
it
very
easily
no
fast
offroad
stuff
cant
gm
build
chevies
like
they
used
to
ford
explorers
look
nice
until
you
look
at
the
price
