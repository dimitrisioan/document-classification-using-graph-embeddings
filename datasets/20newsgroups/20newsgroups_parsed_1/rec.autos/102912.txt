i
dont
know
about
trains
but
ive
saw
a
sign
on
the
back
of
a
greyhound
bus
that
warns
you
that
your
radar
detector
may
be
set
off
it
doesnt
explain
why
but
it
does
set
off
my
radar
detector
because
greyhound
has
apparently
gotten
around
to
installing
their
radar
collisionprevention
system
they
use
radar
to
monitor
how
close
other
vehicles
are
and
how
fast
their
relative
speeds
are
and
signals
a
warning
to
the
driver
if
theyre
coming
up
on
something
too
fast
or
are
getting
too
close
this
is
all
i
remember
from
the
news
reports
a
few
months
back
at
the
time
they
were
only
talking
about
the
possibility
of
installing
the
system
they
didnt
mention
how
it
worked
in
bumpertobumper
traffic
or
how
it
discriminated
between
a
camaro
approaching
at
mph
and
ye
olde
bridge
support
in
the
median
being
approached
at
mph
on
a
curve
i
do
recall
something
about
progressive
stages
of
warnings
from
flashing
lights
to
audible
warningsie
it
goes
from
a
red
too
close
light
to
hysterically
screaming
were
all
going
to
die
