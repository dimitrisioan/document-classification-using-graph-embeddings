re
drag
coefficientsvxs
in
a
previous
article
gary
w
mahan
says
could
someone
explain
how
to
make
sense
of
drag
coefficients
ie
cd
mentioned
in
magazines
i
understand
that
lower
numbers
signify
better
aerodynamics
but
what
does
this
mean
in
the
real
world
is
there
a
way
to
calculate
new
top
speedsassuming
the
car
is
not
rev
limited
at
top
speed
or
mileage
benefits
if
a
identical
car
had
the
cd
reduced
from
to
its
pretty
complex
and
cd
isnt
the
whole
story
either
cd
for
cars
is
usually
calculated
based
on
the
frontal
area
of
the
car
so
a
large
car
with
a
good
cd
could
get
the
same
drag
force
as
a
smaller
car
with
a
poorer
cd
to
calculate
drag
use
this
formula
d
rho
v
cd
s
where
d
is
the
drag
force
lbs
rho
is
the
local
air
density
slugsft
v
is
the
velocity
fts
and
s
is
the
frontal
area
ft
note
that
the
pieces
called
rho
v
are
sometimes
called
qbar
or
dynamic
pressure
a
fancy
aero
term
for
air
pressure
or
force
note
that
power
is
p
f
v
where
p
is
power
lbffts
f
is
the
force
drag
in
this
case
lbf
and
v
is
velocity
fts
note
that
if
you
put
the
whole
equation
into
one
by
substituting
d
for
force
you
get
a
velocity
cubed
term
thats
why
huge
increases
in
power
result
in
little
increases
in
speed
ditto
for
decreases
in
cd
so
if
you
have
a
mph
car
and
reduce
cd
from
to
your
new
top
speed
is
sound
of
trumpet
fanfare
mph
sorry
to
dissappoint
