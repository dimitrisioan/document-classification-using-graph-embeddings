hi
there
maybe
you
can
help
me
i
have
an
corolla
with
a
speed
as
the
subject
line
says
the
gearbox
seems
excessivly
clunky
i
used
to
have
an
corolla
and
it
was
also
somewhat
clunky
but
it
had
more
miles
on
it
and
it
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
this
car
is
there
fluid
in
the
speed
case
if
there
is
could
it
just
be
low
or
in
need
of
a
change
as
i
recall
only
the
autos
have
fluid
or
am
i
just
mistaken
please
no
flames
for
owning
an
import
i
also
have
an
old
dodge
but
its
not
in
very
good
shape
these
days
thanks
derek
