im
looking
for
information
on
opel
cars
now
you
ask
which
model
well
the
sad
truth
is
im
not
entirely
sure
but
its
a
twoseater
with
rollover
headlights
hard
top
and
really
sporty
looking
my
friend
has
one
sitting
in
his
yard
in
really
nice
condition
bodywise
but
he
transmission
has
seized
up
on
him
so
it
hasnt
run
for
a
while
does
anyone
have
any
info
on
these
cars
the
engine
compartment
looks
really
tight
to
work
on
but
it
is
in
fine
shape
and
i
am
quite
interested
in
it
that
would
be
the
opel
gt
sold
in
this
country
from
to
it
originally
had
a
cc
engine
which
was
later
replaced
by
the
cc
it
was
based
on
the
old
kadett
drive
train
and
suspension
with
leaf
springs
in
the
rear
and
a
single
transverse
leaf
spring
in
the
front
it
looked
good
but
was
limited
as
a
performer
there
has
also
been
some
discussion
in
this
thread
about
the
manta
and
other
models
in
opel
introduced
a
new
line
of
models
the
series
that
were
also
known
as
model
numbers
etc
these
cars
had
the
newer
cc
engine
and
were
available
as
two
and
fourdoor
coupes
a
station
wagon
and
a
sport
coupe
known
in
europe
as
the
manta
at
the
same
time
there
were
two
series
cars
which
sold
very
few
numbers
that
also
had
the
engine
but
the
kadett
suspension
the
sport
coupe
model
was
also
available
as
the
rallye
r
with
a
blacked
out
hood
tach
and
fog
lights
but
was
mechanically
the
same
except
for
a
numerically
higher
rear
end
ratio
in
the
sport
coupe
was
also
named
the
manta
in
the
us
was
the
last
year
for
the
gt
in
any
country
both
because
of
the
us
bumper
height
regulations
and
the
fact
that
fiat
exercised
an
option
on
the
factory
that
opel
was
leasing
to
build
the
gts
the
series
continued
in
with
minor
body
differences
in
the
manta
sedan
also
called
the
ascona
and
the
wagon
were
available
with
bosch
electronic
fuel
injection
these
cars
also
had
larger
brakes
and
wider
wheels
these
cars
were
starting
to
compete
with
the
buick
century
low
price
leader
of
the
time
and
were
the
last
opels
imported
into
the
us
from
to
cars
that
sported
buickopel
badges
were
still
sold
by
the
buick
dealers
but
were
rebadged
isuzu
imarks
the
idea
was
to
call
them
opels
instead
of
changing
the
dealers
neon
signs
various
models
of
the
series
cars
dominated
the
showroom
stock
racing
of
the
s
in
their
class
and
were
known
as
serious
competition
parts
are
still
available
from
a
number
of
sources
i
still
have
a
manta
and
two
sedans
and
all
the
trick
parts
i
could
collect
in
years
