tried
any
kind
of
lubricants
wdetc
but

a
suitable
bit

turn

i
retighten

thank
you
very
much
in
advance
winson
dont
worry
about
leaks
dont
worry
about
which
way
to
turn
the
damn
thing
take
a
good
claw
hammer
and
pry
it
straight
out
now
youll
notice
after
all
the
oil
pours
out
that
there
are
no
theads
where
there
used
to
be
thats
why
heli
coils
were
invented
yes
buy
a
few
of
these
gems
and
rethread
the
hole
a
little
larger
each
time
you
change
the
oil
when
the
hole
gets
too
big
for
any
heli
coil
you
can
buy
its
time
to
trade
in
the
car
