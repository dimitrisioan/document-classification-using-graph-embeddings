does
anyone
know
why
autos
are
so
popular
in
the
us
while
here
in
europe
they
are
rare
just
wondering
many
cars
sold
here
in
finland
are
small
and
cheap
cars
at
least
when
compared
to
other
cars
note
that
we
have
over
car
tax
and
you
couldnt
expect
a
good
auto
mated
to
a
l
engine
most
of
the
bigger
cars
are
however
sold
with
autos
here
in
australia
most
cars
are
manual
privately
owned
anyway
why
not
sure
i
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
our
car
industry
in
the
past
was
more
closely
aligned
with
europe
than
the
us
in
the
past
now
its
aligned
with
asia
