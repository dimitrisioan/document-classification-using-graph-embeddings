ashtrays
and
cigarette
lighters
these
should
be
an
option
gm
at
least
is
heading
in
that
direction
one
of
the
postsale
questions
they
asked
me
was
if
id
like
the
choice
of
a
cigarette
liter
or
an
accessory
plug
and
another
whether
id
like
the
choice
of
an
ashtray
or
a
cup
holder
the
geo
storms
have
the
cigarette
lighter
vs
accessory
plug
option
which
did
not
exist
in
the
i
bought
im
not
sure
about
the
ash
tray
vs
cup
holder
its
a
step
in
the
right
direction
the
ashtray
does
make
a
convenient
changeholder
so
its
not
completely
useless
