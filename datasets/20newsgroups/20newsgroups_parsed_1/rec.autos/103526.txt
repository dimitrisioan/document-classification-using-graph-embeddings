a
reformatory
for
juviniles
a
few
blocks
away
they
caught
the
year
old
that
did
it
they
put
a
cover
over
the
overpass
what
else
could
they
do
execute
the
juvi
on
the
grounds
of
the
reformatory
required
attendendence
by
the
rest
of
the
inmates
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
incident
and
a
quick
sure
trial
i
am
quite
serious
cause
and
effect
nothing
else
will
ever
make
a
dent
this
will
not
work
hitleryouth
newark
teenager
car
stealing
epidemics
student
riots
and
other
similar
cases
show
that
death
is
not
a
behaviourshaping
or
even
intimidating
factor
for
teenagers
teens
defy
death
i
is
a
strong
deterent
to
the
teens
that
are
executed
they
wont
do
that
again
this
policy
cuts
way
down
on
repeat
offenders
please
do
not
flame
me
i
dont
agree
with
capital
punishment
for
teens
as
far
as
rock
throwing
is
concerned
well
it
is
very
sad
and
tragic
most
of
these
incidents
stem
from
the
fact
that
these
kids
are
dumb
even
smarter
ones
completely
lack
deductive
thinking
and
cant
foresee
the
consequences
of
their
actions
beyond
immediate
ones
unfortunately
dumbness
and
cars
whizzing
at
mph
make
an
explosive
mix
they
are
also
unsupervised
with
proper
supervision
they
would
not
be
throwing
rocks
if
parents
can
not
provide
the
minimal
supervision
needed
to
stop
this
activity
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
children
notice
the
smiley
however
i
hardly
believe
there
was
intent
to
kill
in
most
of
these
cases
rather
desire
to
see
the
shattering
glass
i
admit
i
was
mercilessly
attacking
moscow
busses
with
a
slingshot
in
my
tender
years
akin
to
a
child
breaking
toys
i
witnessed
several
even
more
endeavouring
projects
like
stacking
up
bricks
on
a
railroad
track
technical
details
of
such
a
venture
completely
dominate
the
possibility
of
a
human
tradegy
heck
when
you
are
you
have
a
vague
concept
of
human
tradegy
in
a
mind
of
a
youngster
im
quite
sure
that
technical
challenge
of
matching
and
predicting
speed
of
a
thrown
stone
so
that
it
gets
the
car
smack
in
the
windshield
completely
occupies
the
teen
not
leaving
much
room
for
other
considerations
