vascar
i
know
this
is
the
wrong
place
to
post
this
but
i
couldnt
find
any
relevant
newsgroups
in
my
area
for
those
of
you
who
are
from
pa
where
is
vascar
where
the
cops
measure
your
speed
from
the
time
it
takes
you
to
cross
the
distance
between
two
white
lines
on
the
road
right
most
commonly
used
im
especially
interested
in
the
pittsburgh
area
specific
locations
prior
experiences
if
possible
for
those
pa
and
nonpa
if
they
use
vascar
in
your
state
is
it
most
common
in
rural
city
highway
areas
etc
what
im
interested
in
mainly
is
where
i
can
speed
with
the
least
risk
of
being
caught
you
can
always
detect
radar
but
theres
no
way
to
fight
vascar
unless
you
know
where
all
the
white
lines
are
thanks
a
lot
