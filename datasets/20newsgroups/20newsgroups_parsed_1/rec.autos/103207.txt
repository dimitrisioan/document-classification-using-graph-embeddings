i
normally
have
an
unloaded
colt
delta
in
my
glove
box
with
a
loaded
magazine
handy
which
is
perfectly
legal
in
oklahoma
for
those
times
that
im
travelling
interstate
i
keep
an
unloaded
sw
magnum
revolver
in
the
glove
box
with
a
speedloader
in
my
pocket
which
is
legal
everywhere
under
federal
law
illinois
state
police
be
hanged
carrying
a
pistol
loaded
or
unloaded
in
the
glove
compartment
is
considered
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
in
colorado
and
is
illegal
without
a
concealed
weapons
permit
unless
the
law
has
been
changed
recently
carrying
a
weapon
openly
is
legal
in
colorado
but
concealing
it
is
illegal
i
read
a
newspaper
account
last
year
where
police
stopped
a
car
on
a
traffic
infraction
and
observed
a
magnum
revolver
sitting
on
the
seat
the
driver
could
not
be
cited
for
possessing
or
carrying
the
weapon
because
it
was
not
concealed
the
article
stated
that
if
the
gun
had
been
discovered
in
the
glove
box
it
would
have
been
considered
a
crime
carrying
in
the
glove
box
is
not
coveredim
not
sure
what
i
was
thinking
there
it
is
legal
in
oklahoma
on
interstate
travel
as
long
as
it
is
legal
for
you
to
own
at
your
point
of
origination
and
destination
the
gun
is
carried
in
a
locked
compartmentbox
glove
box
specifically
excluded
separate
from
the
ammo
it
is
legal
under
title
chapter
section
i
forget
and
my
copy
of
the
regs
is
at
home
of
the
us
code
this
unfortunately
has
not
prevented
the
theft
by
state
troopers
of
a
certain
state
which
shall
remain
nameless
to
protect
the
hopelessly
stupid
under
that
states
law
gee
and
i
thought
federal
law
overrode
state
