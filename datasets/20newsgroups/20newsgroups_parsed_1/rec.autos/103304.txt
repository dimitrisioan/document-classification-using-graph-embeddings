weird
problem
with
gm
banger
transmission
im
having
an
interesting
problem
with
my
girlfriends
car
before
i
delve
into
its
innards
i
thought
id
check
netwisdom
on
the
subject
its
a
buick
skyhawk
i
knowi
know
l
efi
banger
auto
k
miles
when
i
drive
tha
car
long
enough
to
get
it
hot
especially
at
highways
speeds
the
transmission
has
this
nasty
habit
of
getting
stuck
in
rd
gear
as
a
result
when
you
stop
for
a
light
the
motor
stalls
putting
the
car
in
park
and
waiting
for
seconds
before
restarting
sometimes
allows
the
transmission
to
reset
and
go
back
into
st
otherwise
it
just
stalls
when
put
in
drive
my
thoughts
either
it
the
rd
gear
band
is
binding
and
getting
stuck
when
it
gets
hot
not
so
likely
or
perhaps
the
lockup
converter
is
not
disengaging
properly
seems
likely
the
least
likely
keeping
fingers
crossed
is
that
some
critical
vacuum
hose
has
brokencracked
and
this
behaviour
is
due
to
lack
of
vaccuum
somewhere
as
used
to
happen
with
old
modulator
valves
my
background
is
that
my
father
owns
a
service
station
and
i
worked
there
on
and
off
from
years
of
age
please
feel
free
to
be
as
technical
as
you
want
id
appreciate
hearing
any
tipssuggestionsoffers
