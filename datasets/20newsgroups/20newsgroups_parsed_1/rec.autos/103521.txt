my
wife
and
i
looked
at
and
drove
one
last
fall
this
was
a
model
it
was
wayyyyyyyyy
underpowered
i
could
not
imagine
driving
it
in
the
mountains
here
in
colorado
at
anything
approaching
highway
speeds
i
have
read
that
the
new
models
have
a
newer
improved
hp
engine
im
quite
serious
that
i
laughed
in
the
salesman
face
when
he
said
once
its
broken
in
it
will
feel
more
powerful
i
had
been
used
to
driving
a
jeep
l
hp
engine
i
believe
the
s
land
cruisers
land
yachts
were
l
the
sames
as
the
runner
which
is
also
underpowered
in
my
the
and
cruisers
run
the
l
straight
which
only
has
about
hp
and
lbft
of
torque
plenty
offhighway
marginal
on
the
highway
the
has
a
much
improved
l
straight
with
hp
and
ftlb
torque
they
are
big
cars
very
roomy
but
nothing
spectacular
if
you
take
them
on
rough
trails
youll
see
the
difference
the
cruiser
is
an
order
of
magnitude
better
in
offhighway
ability
