s
youre
actually
worried
about
somebody
stealing
your
oil
ahhh
yes
andrew
we
meet
again
no
not
stealing
the
oil
just
draining
it
as
to
leave
me
stranded
cmon
you
think
a
vandalll
do
that
let
me
guess
youre
from
hudson
ohio
thats
absolutely
ridiculous
get
out
and
see
the
world
if
i
were
the
vandal
and
i
really
hated
someone
maybe
someone
who
knew
something
about
cars
of
course
i
would
look
for
any
types
of
valves
i
could
undo
especially
special
oil
drain
plugs
and
radiator
petcocks
as
well
as
putting
bad
things
in
the
gas
while
i
would
never
vandalize
someones
car
if
i
were
to
it
would
probably
be
the
time
bomb
approach
and
im
sure
im
not
the
only
one
who
thinks
that
way
