after
too
many
years
of
school
im
finally
graduating
and
getting
a
real
job
of
course
i
am
trying
to
make
plans
of
how
to
spend
all
this
extra
money
right
now
i
have
an
accord
a
good
car
but
not
real
sporty
i
was
thinking
of
selling
it
in
about
two
years
and
dropping
around
k
on
a
sports
car
of
some
kind
after
thinking
about
it
i
may
have
a
better
idea
ill
keep
the
accord
until
it
drops
and
buy
the
car
ive
always
wanted
a
corvette
stingray
my
reasoning
is
that
accord
corvette
is
less
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basically
im
thinking
of
a
late
s
early
s
for
around
k
my
question
is
what
are
good
years
to
consider
for
reliability
looks
horsepower
in
that
order
believe
it
or
not
horsepower
is
not
a
main
concern
if
i
want
to
go
fast
i
get
on
my
motorcycle
and
what
are
good
prices
also
what
would
insurance
look
like
im
male
single
i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the
car
lower
insurance
would
the
fact
that
i
mainly
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rarely
driven
insurance
class
for
driving
it
under
k
miles
per
year
my
dad
has
a
vette
and
its
on
what
you
say
classic
insurance
basically
what
that
means
is
that
it
has
restricted
amount
of
driving
time
which
basically
means
it
cant
be
used
as
an
every
day
car
and
would
probably
suit
your
needs
for
limited
mileage
in
addition
to
restricted
mileage
many
classic
insurance
carriers
also
require
that
the
vehicle
be
garaged
when
not
in
use
