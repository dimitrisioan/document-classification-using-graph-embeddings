similar
to
the
mach

concept
car
ford

with
around
january
i
cant
wait
anyone

anything
about
it
recently

the
mach

check
out
the
latest
issue
of
popular
mechanics

a

looks
like
a
cross
between
a
dodge

an
eagle

much
uglier
this
car
looks
like
it
should
have
been

have
a
look
maybe
the
picture
in

not
all

bought
a
maybe
theyll
work
on
the
design
a
little
bit
listen
to
consumers
and
come
out
with
nicelooking

out
the
kinks
in
a
new
design
