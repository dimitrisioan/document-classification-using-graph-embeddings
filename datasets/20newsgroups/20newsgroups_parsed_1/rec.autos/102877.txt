i
know
that
this
isnt
the
group
for
it
but
since
you
brought
it
up
does
anyone
have
any
idea
why
they
havent
bombed
the
waco
cult
perhaps
it
is
because
witnesses
who
have
left
the
compound
have
all
testified
that
the
batf
shot
first
they
they
did
not
identify
themselves
before
tossing
in
concussion
grenades
not
that
anyone
inside
could
have
heard
such
identification
after
being
near
a
concussion
grenade
and
the
announcement
from
the
batf
that
they
have
sealed
the
warrant
under
which
they
were
operating
which
was
a
search
warrant
by
the
way
not
an
arrest
warrant
in
short
perhaps
because
the
batf
is
wildly
out
of
control
and
perhaps
calmer
heads
have
realized
that
bombing
a
compound
full
of
woman
and
children
will
not
improve
their
position
there
is
a
real
chance
that
koresh
will
be
able
to
prove
selfdefense
in
court
that
will
leave
what
four
officers
dead
and
no
one
to
blame
but
the
batf
followups
directed
to
altactivism
where
the
discussion
has
raged
nearly
as
long
as
the
seige
and
which
shows
every
sign
of
not
giving
up
nearly
as
soon
