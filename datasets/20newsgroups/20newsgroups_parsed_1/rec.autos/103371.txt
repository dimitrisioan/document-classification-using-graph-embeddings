water
gradually
builds
up
in
the
trunk
of
my
friends
ford
probe
every
once
in
a
while
we
would
have
to
remove
the
spare
and
scoop
out
the
water
under
the
plywoodcarpet
cover
on
the
trunk
i
would
guess
this
usually
happens
after
a
good
thunder
storm
a
few
qs
is
this
a
common
problem
where
are
the
drain
holes
located
for
the
hatch
i
noticed
this
is
my
probe
also
when
recently
cleaning
out
the
back
i
think
the
water
is
coming
up
through
some
rubber
stoppered
holes
beneath
the
spare
mine
looked
slightly
worn
and
there
was
no
water
or
water
damage
above
the
level
of
the
spare
area
i
have
the
same
problem
with
my
probe
the
water
is
definitely
not
comming
up
from
the
rubber
stoppered
hole
beneath
the
spare
i
have
to
remove
the
rubber
stopper
to
drain
the
water
seems
like
a
common
problem
with
probe
