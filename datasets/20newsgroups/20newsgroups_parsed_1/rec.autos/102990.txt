is
it
only
me
or
is
safety
not
one
of
the
most
important
factors
when
buying
a
car
it
depends
on
your
priorities
a
lot
of
people
put
higher
priorities
on
gas
mileage
and
cost
than
on
safety
buying
unsafe
econoboxes
instead
of
volvos
i
personally
take
a
middle
ground
the
only
thing
i
really
look
for
is
a
threepoint
seatbelt
and
mph
bumpers
i
figure
that
mph
collisions
into
brick
walls
arent
common
enough
for
me
to
spend
that
much
extra
money
for
protection
but
there
are
lots
of
lowspeed
collisions
that
do
worry
me
