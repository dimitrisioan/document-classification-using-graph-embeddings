im
looking
for
information
on
opel
cars
now
you
ask
which
model
well
the
sad
truth
is
im
not
entirely
sure
but
its
a
twoseater
with
rollover
headlights
hard
top
and
really
sporty
looking
my
friend
has
one
sitting
in
his
yard
in
really
nice
condition
bodywise
but
he
transmission
has
seized
up
on
him
so
it
hasnt
run
for
a
while
does
anyone
have
any
info
on
these
cars
the
engine
compartment
looks
really
tight
to
work
on
but
it
is
in
fine
shape
and
i
am
quite
interested
in
it
thanks

this
would
be
the
manta
would
it
not
sold
through
buick
dealers
in
the
mid
s
as
the
price
leader
sounds
a
lot
more
like
an
opel
gt
to
me
id
guess
that
this
is
on
the
same
chassis
as
the
kadett
rather
than
the
bigger
manta
but
i
could
easily
be
wrong
i
think
the
later
kadetts
were
sold
here
as
buick
opels
craig
i
think
the
manta
is
the
european
name
for
the
gt
im
pretty
sure
that
the
only
kadetts
sold
here
wereare
the
pontiac
lemans
i
think
the
gt
is
just
an
early
s
to
mid
s

the
manta
was
a
twodoor
sedan
in
the
us
it
had
a
engine
was
sometimes
referred
to
as
an
opel
mantas
are
also
