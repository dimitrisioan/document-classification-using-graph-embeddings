renting
from
alamo
hello
netters
im
visiting
the
us
im
from
sweden
in
august
i
will
probably
rent
a
chevy
beretta
from
alamo
ive
been
quoted
for
a
week
for
additional
days
this
would
include
free
driving
distance
but
not
local
taxes
baltimore
they
also
told
me
all
insurance
thats
necessary
is
included
but
i
doubt
that
cause
a
friend
rented
a
car
last
year
and
it
turned
out
he
needed
a
lot
more
insurance
than
whats
included
in
the
base
price
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didnt
rent
it
from
alamo
does
anyone
have
some
info
on
this
is
a
ripoff
probability
that
ill
be
needing
more
insurance
is
the
beretta
a
good
rental
car
thanx
markus
