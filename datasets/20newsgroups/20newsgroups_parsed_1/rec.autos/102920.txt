re
dumbest
automotive
concepts
of
all
time
no
reverse
lights
are
to
warn
others
that
you
are
backing
up
they
arent
bright
enough
to
typically
see
by
without
the
brake
and
tail
lights
craig
perhaps
instead
of
this
silly
argument
about
what
backup
lights
are
for
couldnt
we
agree
that
they
serve
the
dual
purpose
of
letting
people
behind
your
car
know
that
you
have
it
in
reverse
and
that
they
can
also
light
up
the
area
behind
your
car
while
youre
backing
up
so
you
can
see
backup
lamps
on
current
models
are
much
brighter
than
they
used
to
be
on
older
cars
those
on
my
taurus
wagon
are
quite
bright
enough
to
illuminate
a
good
area
behind
the
car
and
theyre
much
brighter
than
those
on
my
earlier
cars
from
the
s
and
s
insofar
as
vettes
having
side
backup
lights
look
at
a
or
model
or
perhaps
a
year
or
two
earlier
too
and
youll
see
red
side
marker
lamps
and
white
side
marker
lamps
both
near
the
cars
hindquarters
those
arent
just
white
reflectors
