what
car
are
we
talking
about
if
its
camaro
chevellegto
nova
etc
there
are
a
bunch
of
places
to
get
them
a
corvette
but
i
dont
want
to
put
corvette
seats
in
it
the
original
seats
are
in
exc
shape
but
they
are
uncomfortable
as
hell
im
going
to
store
those
and
find
a
set
to
drive
in
i
have
all
the
vette
catalogs
but
im
looking
for
a
more
generic
type
seat
i
can
modify
the
brackets
but
cushion
height
and
overall
width
are
a
concern
ive
looked
through
some
local
boneyards
without
success
i
would
just
like
to
find
a
pair
of
cheapos
to
use
this
summer
tom
call
around
to
some
wrecking
yards
in
your
area
andif
they
have
any
look
at
fiero
seats
they
are
right
down
on
the
floor
like
a
vette
and
not
too
wideif
you
cant
find
any
let
me
know
and
ill
call
around
here
for
you
im
sure
these
yards
ship
stuff
all
the
time
