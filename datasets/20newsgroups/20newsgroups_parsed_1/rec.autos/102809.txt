mind

a
converter
clutch
does
a
lovely
job
of
improving
mpg
but
the
additional
mechanical
advantage
of
the
converter
gives
you
more
acceleration
vs
locked
converter
clutch
than
its
inherent
losses
take
away
the
transmission
in
my
car
contradicts
both
your
assertions
i
get
much
stronger
acceleration
if
i
let
the
convertor
lockup
which
i
can
induce
by
briefly
lifting
off
then
quickly
but
not
too
quickly
to
trigger
a
kickdown
applying
throttle
above
rpms
the
convertor
will
never
unlock
it
would
kickdown
first
who
says
theres
no
skill
involved
in
driving
an
automatic
i
think
of
it
as
the
throttle
and
shifter
combined
into
a
single
pedal
with
my
car
i
can
pretty
much
influence
its
shifting
patterns
with
my
right
foot
while
having
both
hands
to
steer
