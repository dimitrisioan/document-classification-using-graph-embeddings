water
gradually
builds
up
in
the
trunk
of
my
friends
ford
probe
every
once
in
a
while
we
would
have
to
remove
the
spare
and
scoop
out
the
water
under
the
plywoodcarpet
cover
on
the
trunk
i
would
guess
this
usually
happens
after
a
good
thunder
storm
a
few
qs
is
this
a
common
problem
where
are
the
drain
holes
located
for
the
hatch
i
had
the
same
problem
in
my
mx
luckily
i
had
it
fixed
under
warranty
i
think
they
replaced
a
tail
light
gasket
check
with
a
dealer
its
a
known
problem
