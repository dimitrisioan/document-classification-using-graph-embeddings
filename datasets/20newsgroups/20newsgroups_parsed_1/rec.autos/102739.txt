re
saturn
manual
transmission
problem
i
had
exactly
the
same
problem
with
a
horizon
third
gear
would
just
disengage
engine
would
rev
up
kind
of
disconcerting
i
sold
that
car
quite
a
few
years
back
but
the
memory
of
that
tranny
sticks
with
me
it
also
had
a
clutch
chatter
in
first
that
the
dealer
could
not
fix
if
the
lemon
law
had
been
in
place
then
that
car
would
have
been
covered
i
have
had
several
jap
cars
since
then
figuring
the
horizon
was
my
contribution
to
the
american
auto
companies
and
have
never
seen
any
bad
behavior
with
the
exception
of
a
toyota
tercel
with
a
bit
of
clutch
chatter
that
they
did
fix
on
the
first
try
anyway
from
that
day
forward
i
have
sworn
that
i
would
never
purchase
another
american
car
with
a
standard
american
manufacturers
dont
have
a
clue
on
how
to
manufacture
five
speed
transmissions
and
have
been
doing
the
automatics
much
longer
and
on
many
more
cars
however
i
hate
automatics
so
i
am
still
buying
jap
cars
not
sure
this
is
any
help
but
other
cars
do
this
too
