im
getting
a
car
in
the
near
future
ive
narrow
it
down
to
zx
and
sc
which
might
be
a
better
choice
having
driven
both
and
having
owned
an
sc
for
months
now
all
i
can
say
is
it
depends
theyre
both
great
cars
in
fact
my
wife
and
i
are
saving
our
pennies
so
we
can
get
her
the
zx
convertible
in
a
year
the
zx
handles
like
a
dream
while
the
sc
rides
like
a
dream
fit
and
finish
on
both
are
excellent
but
the
lexus
gets
the
nod
in
customer
satisfaction
theyre
both
very
attractive
and
hideously
expensive
the
resale
value
of
the
sc
is
better
than
the
zx
the
zx
isnt
available
with
traction
control
which
makes
it
a
handful
on
slippery
surfaces
