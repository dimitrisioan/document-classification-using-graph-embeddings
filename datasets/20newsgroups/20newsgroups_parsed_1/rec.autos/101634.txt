what
is
volvo
ian
boyle
writes
turbo
in
uk
was
good
for
mph
useful
for
blowing
away
vw
beetles
though
i
believe
the
beetle
corners
better
i
can
say
without
any
doubt
that
i
have
never
been
blown
away
by
any
volvo
ever
ive
been
blocked
into
a
few
car
parks
though
by
shithead
volvo
owners
who
only
thought
theyd
be
a
few
minutes
this
does
not
happen
with
the
owners
of
any
other
makes
of
car
not
sure
how
long
the
small
shitbox
volvos
last
too
damn
long
the
worst
car
i
ever
drove
was
a
hired
in
power
handling
and
ride
it
was
reminiscent
of
something
from
the
s
without
the
character
the
only
ceased
production
a
couple
of
years
back
ive
only
been
a
passenger
in
the
big
volvos
but
that
was
enough
i
ought
to
go
for
a
test
drive
because
they
offer
some
neat
gifts
oh
well
i
have
to
admit
that
the
most
disgusting
feature
of
volvos
is
their
marketing
it
looks
like
volvo
uses
something
like
do
you
dare
to
risk
your
family
in
any
car
attitude
which
is
quite
annoying
in
the
long
run
but
now
volvo
has
produced
a
new
good
car
the
volvo
front
drive
l
valves
motor
completely
new
chassis
etc
even
the
british
magazine
car
liked
it
and
believe
me
that
is
quite
much
for
a
volvo
and
the
american
magazine
road
track
said
that
this
is
not
your
uncle
olofs
car
and
in
a
positive
sense
but
in
any
case
id
still
like
to
own
the
estate
strong
tanklike
chassis
l
inline
six
rear
drive
btw
the
only
car
drivers
who
have
blocked
me
are
land
rover
or
jaguar
drivers
what
you
mean
what
i
drive
a
cheapo
japanese
a
toyota
of
course
i
do
not
have
money
for
a
car
like
bmw
merc
jaguar
saab
volvo
or
etc
if
i
had
the
money
i
would
have
bad
problems
deciding
which
one
to
buy
