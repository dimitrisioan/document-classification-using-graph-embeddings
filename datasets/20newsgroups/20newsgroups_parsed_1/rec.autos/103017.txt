i
have
never
understood
what
posessed
auto
builders
to
put
delicate
controls
which
must
be
used
with
skill
and
finesse
like
clutches
and
brakes
on
the
floor
why
not
hand
control
its
much
much
easier
in
the
early
days
neither
of
these
functions
had
powerassist
so
only
legs
had
enough
strength
to
activate
them
since
then
its
been
traditional
and
people
would
have
a
hard
time
getting
used
to
anything
else
well
where
exactly
would
you
put
a
hand
clutch
and
brake
on
a
motorcycle
its
easy
the
handlebars
have
a
very
limited
range
of
turning
steering
wheels
on
the
other
hand
turn
around
and
around
and
aroundwhich
is
fine
for
electrical
relays
like
your
cruise
control
and
airbagbut
how
many
of
you
want
to
lose
your
clutch
andor
brake
due
to
a
short
circuit
shades
of
the
edsel
they
had
pushbuttons
in
the
steering
wheel
hub
that
controlled
the
auto
tranny
it
was
very
disconcerting
to
shift
into
reverse
when
turning
a
corner
and
the
wires
shorted
there
are
workarounds
but
theres
really
no
reason
to
use
hand
power
on
a
cars
clutch
or
brakes
and
lightening
them
to
the
point
that
they
are
finesse
controls
suitable
for
hand
use
would
increse
the
mechanical
complexity
substantially
look
at
power
brakes
and
nonpower
brakes
for
an
example
i
saw
an
experimental
car
that
had
a
joystick
instead
of
a
steering
wheel
thats
about
useless
imho
another
automotive
oddity
is
separate
keys
for
trunks
doors
and
ignitions
why
on
earth
would
you
want
this
i
know
i
dont
i
want
a
separate
trunk
key
for
security
reasons
it
gives
me
a
totally
separate
lockable
container
for
door
and
ignitionehhh
the
same
keys
ok
i
