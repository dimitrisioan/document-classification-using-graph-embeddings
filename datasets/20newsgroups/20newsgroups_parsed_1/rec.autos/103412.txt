chevy
caprice
my
caprice
classic
with
k
miles
has
finally
reached
the
threshold
of
total
number
of
mechanical
problems
that
i
am
forced
to
post
anyone
out
there
who
might
be
able
to
give
me
some
pointers
on
one
or
more
of
the
below
please
email
or
post
when
making
turns
especially
when
accelerating
there
is
usually
a
loud
thunk
from
the
rear
of
of
the
car
sounds
like
it
could
be
the
differential
what
could
cause
this
is
the
differential
going
bad
i
recently
had
the
differential
fluid
changed
and
it
did
have
tiny
metal
bits
in
it
and
no
the
sound
is
not
something
rolling
around
in
the
trunk
on
starting
the
car
i
get
blue
oil
smoke
from
the
exhaust
for
seconds
exhaust
valves
going
bad
worn
rings
anyone
know
whether
the
valves
on
the
tbi
engine
can
be
lapped
brakes
more
pedal
travel
than
i
feel
comfortable
with
but
master
cylinder
is
full
and
fluid
is
relatively
clear
pedal
does
not
slowly
sink
to
the
floor
when
held
down
pedal
does
not
feel
spongey
but
i
suppose
that
bleeding
the
brakes
might
help
could
anything
else
cause
this
tranny
tranny
problems
seem
to
be
slowly
getting
worse
takes
almost
seconds
to
downshift
from
rd
to
nd
on
heavy
throttle
application
and
more
recently
it
is
reluctant
to
shift
from
nd
to
rd
fluid
checked
with
car
running
with
tranny
put
through
all
the
gears
and
then
back
to
park
as
per
haynes
manual
is
red
and
clear
and
is
on
full
mark
my
springs
all
around
are
just
about
shot
i
have
new
shocks
on
but
car
still
skips
out
on
bumps
in
turns
at
moderate
to
high
speed
how
hard
are
they
to
change
can
they
be
reconditioned
id
be
interested
in
hearing
from
any
gm
fullsize
rwd
owners
out
there
with
stories
to
tell
andor
advice
here
in
philly
these
cars
are
apparently
stolen
quite
often
and
converted
into
taxis
apparently
the
cab
conversion
shops
will
get
a
junk
title
for
the
car
or
switch
vins
with
a
car
about
to
be
junked
about
of
philly
cabs
are
caprices
with
most
of
the
rest
being
crown
vics
with
a
few
old
new
yorkers
and
impalas
