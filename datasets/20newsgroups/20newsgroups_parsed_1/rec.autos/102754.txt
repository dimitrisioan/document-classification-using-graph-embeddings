while
taking
an
extended
easter
vacation
i
was
going
north
on
i
somewhere
between
centerville
tx
and
dallas
tx
and
i
came
upon
a
train
parked
on
a
trestle
with
its
locomotive
sitting
directly
over
the
northbound
lanes
there
appeared
to
be
movement
within
the
cab
and
out
of
curiosity
i
slowed
to
to
get
a
better
look
just
as
i
passed
from
underneath
the
trestle
my
radar
detector
went
into
full
alert
all
lights
lit
and
all
chirps
beeps
and
buzzes
going
strong
i
thought
i
had
been
nailed
good
but
no
police
materialized
could
this
have
been
caused
by
the
trains
radio
or
what
i
dont
know
about
trains
but
ive
saw
a
sign
on
the
back
of
a
greyhound
bus
that
warns
you
that
your
radar
detector
may
be
set
off
it
doesnt
explain
why
but
it
does
set
off
my
radar
detector
from
the
enet
