safety
is
an
important
criterium
for
me
when
buying
a
car
i
wont
buy
a
small
car
like
a
civic
or
whatever
great
safety
handling
speed
for
me
seems
to
me
that
you
would
be
more
dead
in
a
small
car
than
a
large
car
after
an
accident
this
is
a
very
simplistic
view
of
safety
assuming
that
you
are
in
a
collision
less
likely
with
a
more
agile
smaller
car
then
the
important
factor
is
how
well
does
the
car
sacrifice
itself
to
save
you
this
is
why
a
thousand
pound
f
car
can
hit
a
wall
at
and
the
driver
walks
out
and
why
everybody
dies
when
a
suburban
hits
a
wall
at
as
i
recall
for
the
last
generation
suburban
hic
numbers
as
an
aside
just
what
is
the
point
of
an
airbag
it
seems
to
me
that
seatbelts
with
pretensioners
audi
et
al
or
a
good
tight
point
belt
will
prevent
you
every
moving
far
enough
to
hit
the
airbag
you
might
be
saved
from
some
flyign
glass
or
is
an
airbag
just
a
lowest
common
denominator
safety
device
that
is
of
some
use
in
a
head
on
collision
when
you
are
wearing
no
seat
belt
