i
was
worried
about
someone
stealing
my
oil
once
also
i
finally
decided
to
just
have
my
drain
plug
welded
shut
it
works
great
i
figure
that
when
i
add
three
or
four
quarts
when
the
oil
light
comes
on
every
month
or
so
that
its
just
as
good
or
better
than
the
old
wives
tale
of
changing
the
oil
and
filter
every
miles
works
for
me
i
must
say
i
did
the
same
thing
to
my
drain
plug
for
the
same
reasons
i
was
wondering
how
you
filled
your
crankcase
though
as
i
welded
my
hood
shut
also
out
of
fear
that
somebody
might
steal
my
airfilter
oh
come
on
silly
all
you
have
to
do
is
cut
a
hole
in
your
hood
and
put
a
tube
there
so
you
can
get
to
the
oil
fill
hole
what
do
you
think
all
those
big
air
intake
things
are
for
on
those
hotrod
cars
theyre
just
for
looks
onlylittle
does
anyone
know
they
provide
access
to
the
oilfill
hole
well
over
where
we
live
we
have
problems
with
vandals
stealing
peoples
wheels
those
locking
nuts
didnt
stop
them
so
to
be
safe
and
sure
i
welded
the
lug
nuts
to
my
wheels
together
it
works
serious
i
havent
had
my
wheels
stolen
yet
