in
road
and
track
and
car
and
driver
is
that
one
mag
or
two
b
and
i
was
wondering

have
any
opinions
that
differed
from
what
these
mags
have
to
say
im
looking
at
the
following
three
suvs
anyone
whos
driven
all
three
have
any
strong
opinions
ford
explorer
toyota
runner
nissan
pathfinder
currently
im
leaning
toward
the
toyota
cause
ive
had
big
success
with
toyota
trucks
in
the
past
and
cause
i
think
its
the
best
looking
of
the
three
but
i
thought
id
see
if
anyone
has
any
strong
opinions
thanks
karl
i
agree
that
the
toyota
is
the
best
looking
i
just
didnt
fit
plus
it
is
the
highest
cost
of
all
the
ones
you
mentioned
i
have
good
friends
who
have
all
three
of
the
trucks
you
talked
about
the
ones
with
kids
all
went
to
the
ford
because
of
the
room
required
to
carry
a
couple
of
kids
and
all
the
junk
you
need
the
single
ones
went
for
the
toyota
and
the
nissan
every
one
has
been
happy
with
what
they
bought
although
no
one
is
into
serious
four
wheel
off
road
driving
