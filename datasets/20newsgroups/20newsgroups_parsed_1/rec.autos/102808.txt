front
of
a
toyota
pickup
heading
south
on
interstate
north
of
seattle
wa
someone
threw
a
rock
of
an
overpass
and
hit
our
windshield
not
by
accident
im
sure
it
was
impossible
to
get
up
to
the
overpass
quickly
to
see
who
did
it
we
figured
it
was
kids
reported
it
and
left
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
happend
again
and
killed
a
guy
at
my

was
in
his
midfourties
and
left
behind
a
wife
and
children

caught
the
year
old
