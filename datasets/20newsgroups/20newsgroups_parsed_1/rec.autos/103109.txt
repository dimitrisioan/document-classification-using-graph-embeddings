why
anyone
would
order
an
sho
with
an
automatic
transmission
is
beyond
me
if
you
cant
handle
a
stick
you
should
stick
with
a
regular
taurus
and
leave
the
sho
to
real
drivers
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
arent
real
drivers
who
cant
use
the
stick
eg
disabled
persons
but
they
arent
in
any
position
to
use
an
sho
anyway
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
if
we
removed
the
automatic
transmissions
from
all
performancetype
cars
like
the
l
mustangs
camaros
and
the
like
wed
cut
down
on
the
number
of
accidents
each
year
autos
are
fine
for
sedate
little
sedans
but
they
have
no
business
in
performance
cars
imho
james
i
have
to
disagree
with
this
i
have
a
z
with
a
and
a
speed
auto
w
overdrive
and
it
is
really
better
that
way
chevy
autos
are
reknowned
for
their
long
life
and
ability
to
handle
copious
amount
of
power
i
live
in
the
dallas
area
and
a
manual
would
be
much
harder
to
drive
in
the
traffic
here
now
if
i
still
lived
out
in
the
sticks
like
i
used
to
a
manual
would
be
more
fun
safetywise
an
auto
is
less
distractingi
would
hate
to
have
to
be
shifting
gears
while
i
was
trying
to
ease
into
traffic
in
the
freeways
here
performancewise
i
can
hold
my
own
against
any
stock
mustang
or
camaro
w
a
five
speed
all
of
this
imho
robert
l
loper
infinity
is
a
notion
best
contemplated
in
a
warm
bed
texas
instruments
inc
my
opinions
are
my
own
not
tis
