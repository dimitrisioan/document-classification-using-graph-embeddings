re
impala
ss
going
into
i
still
cant
understand
all
the
hype
about
the
impalla
ss
it
still
has
the
ugly
caprice
body
orca
on
wheels
the
caprice
was
the
worst
new
body
style
to
come
out
of
detroit
ever
now
just
because
the
lt
engine
and
a
few
suspension
tweeks
are
being
added
its
still
ugly
its
still
a
barge
gms
answer
to
everything
is
throw
in
a
v
and
someone
will
buy
it
or
add
some
plastic
ground
affects
and
a
few
stickers
and
call
it
a
gt
gtz
or
ss
and
someone
will
buy
it
imho
gm
needs
to
scrap
the
caprice
body
completely
and
start
over
with
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
no
minor
modification
wheel
well
treatments
tail
amp
modification
or
nose
redesign
or
even
the
lt
engine
will
help
the
existing
caprice
