re
instead
of
a
saturn
sc
what
one
thing
that
everyone
is
forgetting
in
this
argument
over
the
pricing
of
the
sc
vs
the
japanese
cars
is
the
saturns
nodicker
sticker
this
makes
the
saturns
price
low
in
comparison
to
the
inflated
base
prices
of
the
japanese
competition
on
paper
but
in
reality
one
could
dicker
several
hundred
dollars
off
the
price
of
the
japanese
cars
admittedly
though
here
in
canada
at
least
the
sc
is
in
the
same
price
class
as
the
civic
si
not
the
sc
