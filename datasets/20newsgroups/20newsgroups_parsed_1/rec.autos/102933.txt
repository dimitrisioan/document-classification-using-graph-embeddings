re
ad
said
nissan
altima
best
seller
i
too
was
puzzled
by
this
obvious
untruth
what
i
think
is
going
on
is
that
nissan
claims
that
the
altima
is
the
best
selling
new
car
namelplate
in
the
us
i
think
i
have
this
near
verbatim
lee
iaccocas
statistics
dept
would
have
been
proud
of
that
sentence
note
that
the
corollaprism
are
also
new
designs
but
hey
are
not
new
nameplates
i
guess
nissan
doesnt
even
sell
as
many
altimas
as
toyota
does
corollas
or
there
would
be
no
nameplate
qualifier
