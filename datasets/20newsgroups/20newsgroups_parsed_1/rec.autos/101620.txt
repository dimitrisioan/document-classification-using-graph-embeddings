i
am
the
person
who
started
out
this
subject
to
me
the
question
really
is
not
about
dealer
profit
but
the
amount
of
money
for
the
type
of
car
ive
settled
with
a
new
subaru
wagon
with
the
similar
amount
of
money
a
saturn
dealer
asked
for
a
sw
ok
i
know
its
a
model
but
i
think
i
got
a
better
car
though
i
have
to
adjust
my
initial
idea
of
why
i
am
getting
a
new
car
today
during
a
conversion
with
a
friend
i
learned
he
rejected
a
saturn
for
a
ford
tarurs
as
it
only
costed
him
a
little
bit
more
than
a
sl
i
may
be
wrong
but
a
loaded
tarus
beats
a
saturn
sl
i
agree
that
a
fullyloaded
sl
would
come
close
in
price
to
a
lowerend
ford
taurus
a
fullyloaded
taurus
on
the
other
hand
would
still
be
substantially
more
expensive
than
even
the
most
glitzy
sl
a
fully
loaded
sl
would
run
somewhere
around
while
a
fully
loaded
taurus
lx
would
be
somewhere
around
the
range
a
base
taurus
gl
i
believe
might
start
around
of
course
there
is
the
taurus
sho
which
can
push
if
you
really
try
but
this
is
a
totally
different
car
than
your
mainstream
taurus
sedan
your
statement
was
not
entirely
faulty
just
a
little
inaccurate
i
cant
see
saturn
is
of
better
value
and
that
is
why
i
was
puzzled
by
its
pricings
oh
we
did
not
spend
much
time
getting
our
deals
being
better
informed
has
its
advantages
well
thats
ok
at
least
youre
not
bitching
about
dealer
profits
like
some
of
the
other
netters
are
you
seem
to
have
rationally
picked
out
the
car
that
is
best
for
you
the
loyale
is
an
aging
design
that
is
about
to
be
replaced
by
the
impreza
wagon
so
you
probably
got
a
good
deal
on
one
of
the
last
ones
then
again
i
may
be
wrong
