you
can
avoid
these
problems
entirely
by
installing
an
oil
drain
valve
in
place
of
the
bolt
i
have
one
on
both
of
my
cars
there
have
been
no
leaks
in
miles
combined
miles
on
both
cars
yes
but
then
someone
would
have
no
problem
draining
your
oil
in
a
parking
lot
all
they
have
to
do
is
reach
underneath
turn
a
valve
and
forget
the
trip
home
but
there
is
less
likelyhood
they
have
a
wrench
with
them
i
personally
recommend
installing
a
special
locking
drain
plug
to
keep
vandals
away

i
was
worried
about
someone
stealing
my
oil
once
also
i
finally
decided
to
just
have
my
drain
plug
welded
shut
it
works
great
i
figure
that
when
i
add
three
or
four
quarts
when
the
oil
light
comes
on
every
month
or
so
that
its
just
as
good
or
better
than
the
old
wives
tale
of
changing
the
oil
and
filter
every
miles
works
for
me
i
must
say
either
ive
just
fallen
for
this
or
you
guys
are
really
paranoid
youre
actually
worried
about
somebody
stealing
your
oil
cmon
you
think
a
vandalll
do
that
thats
absolutely
ridiculous
besides
how
hard
is
it
to
get
under
the
car
to
change
the
oil
i
can
say
from
experience
on
the
cars
that
ive
driven
and
changed
the
oil
on
my
mazda
is
pretty
much
a
pain
but
once
youve
done
it
once
you
dont
forget
how
and
it
gets
easier
i
cant
imagine
any
other
cars
are
much
worse
than
mine
andy
infante
you
can
listen
to
what
everybody
says
but
the
fact
remains
bmw
r
that
youve
got
to
get
out
there
and
do
the
thing
yourself
dod
joan
sutherland
my
opinions
dammit
have
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
else
