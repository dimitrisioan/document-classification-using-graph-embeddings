i
heard
chrysler
is
planning
to
design
or
is
in
the
process
of
designing
a
compact
sedan
line
based
on
the
lh
platform
if
these
were
as
thought
out
as
the
full
sized
sedans
and
priced
competitively
i
see
no
reason
why
they
could
not
give
the
imports
and
even
the
saturns
a
serious
challenge
oh
goody
we
now
get
to
see
saturns
sold
through
cryco
dealers
fab
why
is
it
this
ahole
insist
on
remarks
like
this
i
really
am
growing
tired
of
this
s
drew
do
you
have
a
kill
file
for
your
newsreader

put
the
name
spencer
in
my
kill
file
and
that
gives
me
about
less
articles
per
day
that
i
have
to
sift
through
