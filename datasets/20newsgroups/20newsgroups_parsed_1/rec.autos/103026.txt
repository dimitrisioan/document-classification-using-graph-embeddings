sorry
for
the
misspelling
but
i
forgot
how
to
spell
it
after
my
series
of
exams
and
noon
hand
reference
here
is
it
still
possible
to
get
those
cute
wwii
vw
jeepwannabes
a
replica
would
be
great
i
think
tkh
the
vw
thing
kubelwagen
lookalike
is
still
manufactured
in
mexico
and
possibly
south
america
good
luck
importing
one
they
probably
dont
meet
us
safety
and
pollution
requirements
there
are
mechanics
and
junkyards
which
specialize
in
vw
they
might
be
helpful
for
finding
a
thing
unless
the
wwii
reenacters
have
grabbed
them
all
the
wwii
kubelwagen
was
the
german
equivalent
of
the
jeep
but
was
not
wheel
drive
one
is
on
display
at
the
patton
museum
at
fort
knox
kentucky
also
the
rare
schwimwagen
sp
amphibious
version
in
fullscale
dioramas
highly
recommended
