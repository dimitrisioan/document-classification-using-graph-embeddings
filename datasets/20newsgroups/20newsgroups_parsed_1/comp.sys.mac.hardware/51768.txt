applied
engineering
has
something
called
the
quadralink
which
is
a
card
with
serial
ports
that
you
get
at
through
the
comms
toolbox
in
addition
to
the
builtin
ones
it
also
comes
with
software
for
fooling
applications
to
open
an
ae
port
when
they
think
they
open
a
builtin
port
they
also
have
a
more
expensive
card
with
dma
better
performance
and
i
think
they
or
someone
else
have
a
card
that
handles
ports
simultaneously
as
i
said
with
nubus
youre
green

how
to
use
the
comms
resource
manager
to
get
at
the
various
installed
cards
