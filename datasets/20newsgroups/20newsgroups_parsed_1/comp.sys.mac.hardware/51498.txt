appletalk
card
question
i
have
a
chance
to
buy
a
used
ps
appletalk
card
to
create
a
network
with
my
home
machines
however
the
guy
who
has
the
card
tells
me
theres
a
db
or
db
cant
remember
now
on
the
back
of
the
card
rather
than
the
pin
or
pin
minidin
that
i
expect
this
sounds
more
like
a
thicknet
ethernet
card
should
there
be
a
transciever
on
it
like
on
the
quadras
what
would
be
a
reasonable
price
to
expect
to
pay
for
one
of
these
cards
keeping
in
mind
that
its
microchannel
architecture
which
means
take
your
best
guess
and
double
it
email
replies
would
be
appreciated
to
here
or
to
thanks
