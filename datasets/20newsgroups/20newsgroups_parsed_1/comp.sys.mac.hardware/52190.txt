re
svga
monitors
and
centris
the
real
story
the
origional
bit
is
missing
but
longshort
follows
the
origional
poster
asked
if
heshe
could
use
any
old
vgasvga
monitor
with
a
centris
hence
title
the
answer
ot
this
question
is
an
unqualified
yes
you
can
use
any
old
vgasvga
monitor
with
a
centris
you
do
need
an
adaptor
i
use
a
mac
vgaq
from
james
engineering
to
run
between
the
two
machines
the
adaptor
i
have
mentioned
will
convert
a
centris
to
a
three
row
vgasvga
pin
adaptor
for
your
monitor
now
the
special
interest
disclaimer
the
above
answer
is
correct
for
using
a
vga
monitor
at
x
resolution
if
your
monitor
will
sync
to
khz
horizontal
the
above
adaptor
will
allow
you
to
choose
x
resolution
i
prefer
this
on
my
s
then
you
have
the
question
of
matching
adaptors
and
sync
rates
i
would
advocate
calling
james
engineering
because
they
seem
to
have
a
clue
as
to
the
comment
by
the
person
who
said
dont
bother
calling
apple
because
they
will
treat
you
like
an
idiot
this
is
totally
untrue
apple
will
treat
you
like
a
fking
assanine
idiot
for
even
considering
going
third
party
and
if
you
want
this
treatment
wants
you
to
pay
for
their
thech
support
line
the
supposedly
compitantly
one
and
then
still
has
no
fu
clue
personal
experience
also
the
tech
suppport
for
the
vga
monitor
makers
doesnt
see
to
extend
to
macs
sony
magnavox
in
addition
to
this
to
find
out
the
info
you
will
have
to
call
dealers
unless
you
can
find
the
sync
rates
elsewhere
as
ads
like
hardware
that
fits
that
rate
monitor
resolutions
give
the
most
favorable
rating
which
usually
means
you
can
get
this
if
you
use
a
specialized
application
video
cardie
well
you
can
get
a
resolution
x
on
this
super
smelly
sock
monitor
that
will
let
you
display
two
full
pages
side
by
side
all
you
need
is
our
reasonably
priced
oder
eater
video
board
for
and
it
will
give
you
an
ultra
fast
horizontal
sync
rate
of
six
fast
kilohertz
and
three
khz
vertical
note
with
the
sony
at
least
on
the
centris
built
in
video
board
using
an
x
adaptor
there
is
a
boarder
of
an
inch
to
the
sides
of
the
image
after
adjusting
the
horizontal
width
as
favorably
as
possible
using
a
x
adaptor
this
can
be
reduced
to
about
half
an
inch
