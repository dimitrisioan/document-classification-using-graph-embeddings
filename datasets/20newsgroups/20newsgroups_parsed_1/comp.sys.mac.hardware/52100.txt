re
when
is
apple
going
to
ship
cdis
in
article
writes
the
cd
external
is
already
shipping
and
has
been
shipping
for
quite
awhile
now
demand
for
the
units
are
high
so
they
are
pretty
rare
ive
seen
them
listed
for
around
at
local
computer
stores
and
the
campus
mac
reseller
ive
also
heard
rumors
that
they
are
bundled
with
a
couple
of
cds
i
had
mention
in
a
previous
article
that
i
was
searching
for
the
external
drive
i
did
call
apple
catalog
as
recommended
and
they
told
me
the
drives
were
back
ordered
until
may
i
placed
an
order
anyways
and
two
days
later
i
had
a
visit
from
federal
express
well
you
can
guess
how
i
spent
my
weekend
of
course
i
ended
up
paying
list
price
but
you
do
get
a
free
copy
of
pc
exchange
when
you
order
from
the
apple
catalog
you
may
want
to
check
if
they
have
any
internal
drives
btw
an
older
version
of
gatekeeper
i
dont
recall
which
version
hung
up
my
mac
when
trying
to
access
a
photocd
or
audio
disk
i
got
the
newer
version
which
did
mention
a
conflict
with
the
apple
xx
cd
driver
