i
have
a
question
congratulations
youve
come
to
the
right
place
usenet
is
a
wonderful
resource
for
information
ranging
from
basic
questions
how
do
i
lock
a
floppy
disk
to
queries
that
would
make
steve
jobs
himself
run
screaming
from
the
room
in
terror
i
used
resedit
to
remove
resources
init
wdef
and
nvir
from
my
system
file
and
used
the
hex
editor
to
add
code
string
ab
as
a
patch
to
the
sfgetfile
routine
so
the
standard
file
dialog
box
would
be
a
nice
shade
of
mauve
everything
worked
fine
until
i
installed
supercdevblaster
and
now
when
i
use
the
aldus
driver
to
print
from
pagemaker
d
to
a
linotronic
my
system
hangs
ps
im
running
system
on
a
powerbook
since
the
macintosh
newsgroups
are
medium
to
high
volume
we
ask
that
you
first
peruse
this
faq
list
including
at
least
the
table
of
contents
for
the
other
pieces
of
it
check
any
other
relevant
online
resources
listed
below
in
question
especially
the
faq
lists
for
the
other
macintosh
newsgroups
and
rtfm
read
the
friendly
manual
before
posting
your
question
we
realize
that
you
are
personally
incensed
that
the
system
is
taking
up
fourteen
of
your
newlyinstalled
twenty
megs
of
ram
but
this
question
has
already
made
its
way
around
the
world
three
hundred
times
before
and
its
developing
tired
feet
finally
before
posting
to
any
newsgroup
macintosh
or
otherwise
please
familiarize
yourself
with
the
basic
etiquette
of
usenet

pieces
are
named
as
per
the
last
part
of
the
newsgroup
they
cover
followed
by
faq
eg
systemfaqz
miscfaqz
the
z
means
the
file
is
stored

so
youll
need

mode
and
use
either
maccompress
stuffit
deluxe

the
unix

command
to
decompress
it

at

some
idea
whether

is
answered
anywhere
else
in

faq
even
if
you
dont
have
the
other
parts
at
hand
its
not
always
obvious
especially
to
newcomers
where
a
particular

or
comment
should
be
posted

yourself
with
the
faq

in
all
the
major

which
newsgroup
should
i
post
to
there
are
no
stupid
questions
but
there
are
misplaced
ones
you
wouldnt
ask
your
english
teacher
how
to
do
the
definite
integral
of
ln
x
between
zero
and
one
would
you
so
dont
ask
the
programmer
newsgroup
why
your
system
is
so
slow
when
microsoft
word
is
in
the
background
ignorance
of
basic
netiquette
is
not
an
excuse
if
you
want
people
to
help
you
you
need
to
learn
their
ways
of
communicating
posting
questions
to
the
proper
newsgroup
will
fill
your
mailbox
with
pearls
of
wisdom
and
maybe
a
few
rotten
oysters
too
posting
to
the
wrong
newsgroup
often
engenders
a
thundering
silence
for
instance
the
most
common
and
glaring
mispost
one
that
seems
as
incongruous
to
dwellers
in
the
macintosh
regions
of
usenet
as
would
a
purple
elephant
to
aleuts
in
the
arctic
asking
a
question
about
networking
anywhere
except
compsysmaccomm
normally
produces
no
useful
responses
posting
the
same
question
to
compsysmaccomm
ensures
that
your
post
is
read
and
considered
by
dozens
of
experienced
network
administrators
and
not
a
few
network
software
designers
please
post
to
exactly
one
newsgroup
do
not
crosspost
if
a
question
isnt
important
enough
for
you
to
take
the
extra
minute
to
figure
out
where
it
properly
belongs
its
not
important
enough
for
several
thousand
people
to
spend
their
time
reading
for
the
same
reason
compsysmacmisc
should
not
be
used
as
a
catchall
newsgroup
the
breakdown
of
questions
between
different
newsgroups
in
this
document
can
also
serve
as
a
reasonable
guide
to
what
belongs
where
specifically
questions
about
productivity
applications
software
you
bought
your
macintosh
to
run
not
software
you
bought
to
make
your
macintosh
run
better
should
go
to
compsysmacapps
unless
the
application
is
covered
in
a
more
specific
newsgroup
communications
programs
games
hypercard
compilers
and
databases
all
have
more
topical
compsysmac
newsgroups
post
questions
about
noncommunications
hardware
including
questions
about
what
software
is
necessary
to
make
particular
hardware
work
to
compsysmachardware
questions
about
macos
system
software
belong
in
compsysmacsystem
questions
about
utilities
and
extensions
normally
belong
in
compsysmacmisc
questions
about
aux
go
to
compunixaux
detailed
questions
about
appletalk
belong
in
compprotocolsappletalk
direct
questions
about
hypercard
to
compsysmachypercard
nonhypercard
programming
questions
and
questions
about
development
environments
should
go
to
compsysmacprogrammer
resedit
questions
may
be
posted
either
to
compsysmacmisc
compsysmacsystem
or
compsysmacprogrammer
but
generally
the
netters
who
inhabit
the
darker
recesses
of
compsysmacprogrammer
are
considerably
more
practiced
at
the
art
of
resource
hacking
a
general
exception
to
the
above
rules
is
that
any
very
technical
question
about
an
application
that
actually
begins
to
delve
into
the
hows
of
a
program
as
well
as
the
whats
recent
example
how
does
writenow
which
is
written
entirely
in
assembly
compare
to
other
word
processors
written
in
high
level
languages
might
be
better
addressed
to
the
programmer
newsgroup
for
sale
and
want
to
buy
posts
should
go
to
compsysmacwanted
and
miscforsalecomputersmac
only
we
understand
that
youre
desperate
to
sell
your
upgraded
k
mac
to
get
the
for
a
powerbook
but
trust
me
anyone
who
wants
to
buy
it
will
be
reading
compsysmacwanted
political
and
religious
questions
the
mac
is
better
than
windows
is
not
is
too
is
not
is
too
hey
how
bout
the
amiga
what
about
it
is
not
is
too
belong
in
compsysmacadvocacy
anything
not
specifically
mentioned
above
probably
belongs
in
compsysmacmisc
finally
dont
be
so
provincial
as
to
consider
only
the
compsysmac
newsgroups
the
appropriate
forums
for
your
questions
many
questions
about
modems
in
compsysmaccomm
are
much
more
thoroughly
discussed
in
compdcommodems
questions
about
mac
midi
are
often
better
handled
in
compmusic
even
though
its
not
a
macintosh
specific
newsgroup
shop
around
usenets
a
big
place
and
not
everything
relevant
to
the
macintosh
happens
in
compsysmac
someone
just
asked
why
the
system
was
taking
up
sixteen
of
their
twenty
megabytes
of
ram
shouldnt
i
put
my
brilliance
and
wit
on
display
for
the
world
by
posting
the
seventeenth
response
no
frequent
answers
are
just
as
boring
and
uninteresting
as
frequent
questions
unless
you
really
have
something
new
to
add
to
the
traditional
answers
such
as
the
recent
discovery
that
fonts
in
system
could
eat
memory
private
email
is
a
much
better
medium
for
answering
common
questions
like
this
one
you
might
want
to
add
a
mention
of
this
faq
in
your
email
response
and
a
polite
suggestion
that
your
correspondent
read
it
before
posting
future
questions
i
do
read
all
the
newsgroups
covered
here

have
written
a
small

that
lets
me
send

people
with
frequently
asked
questions
the
section
of
this

that
answers
their

with
just
the
click
of
a

so
please
dont
feel
obligated
to
respond
to
someone
who
cares
so
little
about
the

they
cant
be

notes
on

stuffit
is
a
family
of
products
that
use
several
different
compression
schemes
the
freeware
stuffit
expander
will
unstuff
all
of
them
versions
of
stuffit
earlier
than
stuffit
stuffit
classic
unstuffit
and
stuffit
deluxe
and
will
not
unstuff
the
increasing
number
of
files
stuffed
by
stuffit
you
need
to
get
a
more
recent
version
of
stuffit
or
stuffit
expander
stuffit
lite
and
deluxe
consistently
makes
smaller
archives
than
any
other
macintosh
compression
utility
to
allow
maximum
space
for
files
on
the
various
ftp
sites
and
to
keep
netbandwidth
down
please
compress
all
files
you
send
to
anonymous
ftp
sites
with
stuffit
uutool
maccompress
and
suntar
handle
the
popular
unix
formats
of
uuencode
uu
compress
z
and
tar
tar
respectively
the
unix
versions
are
often
more
robust
than
the
mac
products
so
use
them
instead
when
thats
an
option
translators
that
allow
stuffit
lite
to
expand
uuencoded
and
tar
files
are
also
available
by
anonymous

macutil
is
dik
winters
package
of
unix
utilities
to
decompress
and
debinhex
files
on
a
workstation
before
downloading
them
to
a
mac
since
unix
stores
files
differently
than
does
the
mac
macutil
creates
macbinary
bin
files
which
should
be
automatically
converted
on
download
it
cant
decompress
everything
in
particular
it
cant
decompress
the
new
stuffit
archives
however
if
you
need
only
one
or
two
files
out
of
an
archivefor
instance
if
you
want
to
read
the
readme
to
find
out

a

you

a
few
notes
on
the
compression
formats
bin
these
are
macbinary
files
always
use
a
binary
file
transfer
protocol
when
transferring
them
never
ascii
or
text
most
files
on
the
net
are
stored
as
hqx
instead
only
rascal
stores
most
of
its
files
in
bin
format
most
communications
programs
such
as
zterm
and
mackermit
are
capable
of
translating
macbinary
files
on
the
fly
as
they
download
if
they
know
in
advance
theyll
be
downloading
macbinary
files
image
this
format
is
normally
used
only
for
system
software
so
that
online
users
can
download
files
that
can
easily
be
converted
into
exact
copies
of
the
installer
floppies
instead
of
using
diskcopy
to
restore
the
images
to
floppies
you
can
use
steve
christensens
freeware
utility
mountimage
to
treat
the
images
on
your
hard
disk
as
actual
floppies
inserted
in
a
floppy
drive
mountimage
has
a
reputation
for
being
buggy
so
you
should
have
some
blank
floppies
and
a
copy
of
diskcopy
handy
just
in
case
sea
x
x
sea
files
dont
merit
a
position
in
the
above
table
because
theyre
selfextracting
they
may
have
been
created
with
compact
pro
stuffit
or
even
diskdoubler
but
all
should
be
capable
of
decompressing
themselves
when
doubleclicked
for
some
unknown
reason
alysis
has
chosen
not
to
use
this
industry
standard
designation
for
selfextracting
archives
created
with
their
payware
products
superdisk
and
more
disk
space
instead
they
append
either
x
or
x
to
selfextracting

how
can
i
get
binhex
stuffit
etc
by
far
the
easiest
way
to
get
these
programs
is
to
ask
a
human
being
to
copy
them
onto
a
floppy
for
you
if
youre
at
a
university
theres
absolutely
no
excuse
for
not
finding
someone
to
give
you
a
copy
and
if
youre
anywhere
less
remote
than
mcmurdo
sound
chances
are
very
good
that
someone
at
a
computer
center
dealership
or
user
group
can
provide
you
with
a
copy
of
stuffit
once
you
have
stuffit
any
version
you
dont
need
binhex
if
youre
such
a
computer
geek
that
the
thought
of
actually
asking
a
living
breathing
human
being
instead
of
a
computer
terminal
for
something
turns
you
into
a
quivering
mass
of
protoplasmic
jelly
you
can
probably
download
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
from
a
local
bulletin
board
system
if
you
have
religious
objections
to
software
gotten
by
any
means
other
than
anonymous
ftp
then
i
suppose
ill
mention
that
you
can
in
fact
ftp
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
though
this
is
by
far
the
hardest
way
to
get
it
ftp
to
wuarchivewustledu
and
login
type
the
word
binary
hit
return
type
cd
mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression
and
hit
return
then
get
stuffitexpanderseabin
and
hit
return
of
course
its
always
possible
that
by
the
time
you
read
this
stuffit
expander
will
have
been
updated
and
the
name
changed
so
if
this
fails
look
for
something
similar
if
youve
ftpd
straight
onto
your
mac
you
should
now
have
a
selfextracting
archive
which
will
produce
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
expander
when
doubleclicked
if
youve
ftpd
to
your
mainframe
or
unix
account
first
you
still
need
to
use
a
modem
program
to
download
it
to
your
mac
just
make
sure
that
the
mac
is
receiving
in
macbinary
mode
and
the
mainframe
is
sending
in
binary
mode
if
you
need
more
details
on
the
last
step
consult
the
faq
list
for
compsysmaccomm
and
the
manuals
for
both
your
mainframe
and
macintosh
telecommunications
software
how
can
i
get
binhex
stuffit
etc
from
a
pc
you
cant
there
is
absolutely
no
way
to
get
an
executable
macintosh
file
from
an
ftp
site
onto
a
pc
and
then
onto
your
mac
without
some
software
obtained
by
means
other
than
anonymous
ftp
you
must
beg
borrow
or
steal
the
necessary
software
such
as
binhex
or
stuffit
lite
from
another
person
i
realize
this
may
terrify
those
among
you
who
havent
left
your
parents
basement
since
you
got
an
apple
ii
in
but
eventually
youre
going
to
need
to
link
up
with
some
human
being
other
than
your
mother
though
i
suppose
if
youre
this
much
of
a
nerd
you
could
send
your
mother
out
to
get
it
for
you
while
youre
gathering
your
nerves
for
a
venture
into
the
strange
and
terrifying
world
of
daylight
please
dont
bother
the
net
by
asking
this
question
again
there
simply
is
no
way
to
move
executable
macintosh
programs
from
a
pc
or
other
nonmacintosh
computer
onto
a
mac
without
software
that
is
not
bundled
with
most
macs
troubleshooting
what
to
do
before
posting
when
things
go
wrong
while
the
various
faq
lists
cover
a
lot
of
specific
problems
there
are
far
more
problems
that
arent
covered
here
these
are
a
few
basic
techniques
you
should
follow
before
asking
for
help
you
should
probably
also
perform
the
tenstep
preventative
maintenance
routine
described
in
section
four
especially
rebuilding
the
desktop
and
resizing
the
system
heap
following
these
steps
may
or
may
not
solve
your
problem
but
it
will
at
least
make
it
easier
for
others
to
recommend
solutions
to
you
identify
the
problem
microsoft
word
is
crashing
doesnt
say
much
what
were
you
doing
when
it
crashed
can
you
repeat
the
actions
that
lead
to
the
crash
the
more
information
you
provide
about
the
actions
preceding
the
crash
the
more
likely
it
is
someone
can
help
you
the
more
precisely
youve
identified
the
problem
and
the
actions
preceding
it
step
the
easier
it
will
be
to
tell
if
the
following
steps
fix
the
problem
for
example
sometimes
quarkxpress
crashes
with
a
coprocessor
not
installed
error
is
not
nearly
as
helpful
as
quarkxpress
crashes
when
i
link
two
text
boxes
on
a
master
page
when
copies
of
those
text
boxes
already
contain
text
the
former
will
leave
you
wondering
whether
the
bug
remains
after
a
given
step
the
latter
lets
you
go
right
to
the
problem
and
see
if
its
still
there
or
not
read
the
read
me
file
many
companies
include
a
list
of
known
incompatibilities
and
bugs
in
their
read
me
files
often
these
arent
documented
in
the
manual
read
any
read
me
files
to
see
if
any
of
the
problems
sound
familiar
check
for
viruses
run
disinfectant
or
another
antiviral
across
your
disk
virus
infections
are
rarer
than
most
people
think
but
they
do
occur
and
they
do
cause
all
sorts
of
weird
problems
when
they
do
reinstall
the
application
and
all
its
support
files
for
half
a
dozen
reasons
external
magnetic
fields
improperly
written
software
the
alignment
of
the
planets
a
file
on
a
disk
may
not
contain
the
data
its
supposed
to
contain
this
can
cause
all
types
of
unexplained
unusual
behavior
restoring
from
original
masters
will
normally
fix
this
reinstall
the
system
software
bits
are
even
more
likely
to
get
twiddled
in
the
system
file
than
in
the
application
and
the
effects
can
be
just
as
disastrous
see
question
for
a
detailed
procedure
for
performing
a
clean
reinstall
if
the
problem
continues
to
occur
after
youve
taken
these
steps
chances
are
youve
found
either
a
conflict
between
your
application
and
some
other
software
or
a
genuine
bug
in
the
program
so
its
time
to
isolate
the
problem
you
need
to
find
the
minimal
system
on
which
the
problem
will
assert
itself
here
are
the
basic
steps
of
isolating
the
cause
of
a
system
or
application
crash
a
run
only
one
application
at
a
time
occasionally
applications
do
conflict
with
each
other
if
the
problem
does
not
manifest
itself
without
other
applications
running
simultaneously
you
can
begin
launching
other
applications
until
you
find
the
one
that
causes
the
crash
b
if
youre
running
system
turn
off
multifinder
if
youre
running
system
allot
as
much
memory
to
the
application
as
you
can
afford
sometimes
programs
just
need
more
memory
especially
when
performing
complicated
operations
c
if
youre
running
system
turn
off
virtual
memory
and
bit
addressing
theres
still
an
awful
lot
of
system
hostile
software
out
there
including
some
from
companies
that
really
have
no
excuse
can
you
say
microsoft
word
boys
and
girls
i
knew
you
could
some
of
this
software
only
expresses
its
incompatibilities
when
certain
uncommon
actions
are
taken
d
boot
from
a
virgin
system
floppy
if
the
problem
disappears
you
likely
have
an
init
conflict
you
need
to
progressively
remove
extensions
until
the
problem
vanishes
use
a
little
common
sense
when
choosing

either
remove

of

perform
a

by
removing
half
of

once
the

disappears
add
half
of
the
most

continue
until
youve
narrowed
the

down
to

youve

with
only
that

enabled
just
to
make
sure
that
it

it
alone
is
indeed
causing
the

you
should
have
a

you

spend
a

rethink
your

some
macintoshes
attract

like
a

seriously
consider
whether
you
actually
need
every
extension
in
your
collection
if
you
dont
use
the
functionality
of
an
extension
at
least
every
fifth
time
you
boot
up
youre
probably
better
off
not
storing
it
in
your
system
folder
where
it
only
takes
up
memory
destabilizes
your
system
and
slows
down
every
startup
for
instance
if
you
only
read

once
a

theres
no

resize
the

even
after

their

two
most
people
still
have
at
least
half
a
row
of

march
across
the
bottom
of
their

every
time
they
restart
all
these
extensions
and
most
applications
too
need
space
in
a
section
of
memory
called
the
system
heap
if
the
system
heap
isnt
big
enough
to
comfortably
accommodate
all
the
programs
that
want
a
piece
of
it
they
all
start
playing
king
of
the
mountain
on
the
system
heap
knocking
each
other
off
to
get
bigger
pieces
for
themselves
and
trying
to
climb
back
on
after
they
get
knocked
off
all
this
fighting
amongst
the
programs
severely
degrades
system
performance
and
almost
inevitably
crashes
the
mac
if
youre
using
system
your
macintosh
will
automatically
resize
the
system
heap
as
necessary
but
if
youre
running
system
its
important
to
set
your
system
heap
size
large
enough
to
manage
all
your
extensions
and
applications
by
default
this
size
is
set
to
k
way
too
small
for
most
macs

lets

it
can
tell
how

system

can
become
corrupt

fragmented
especially
if
youve
stored
lots
of

inside
them
merely
updating
the
system
software
will
often
not
fix
system

corruption
i
recommend
doing
a
clean
reinstall
heres
how
boot
from
the

floppy
of
your

copy

also
trash
the

multifinder
da

and
all
other
standard
apple

these
will
all
be

move

rename
the

any

other
than

is
fine
doubleclick
the
installer
script
on
your
system
disk
then
choose
customize
select
the
appropriate
software
for
your
model
mac
and
printer
you
could
do
an
easy
install
instead
but
that
will
only
add
a
lot
of
extensions
and
code
you
dont
need
that
waste
your
memory
and
disk
space
once
installation
is
finished
move
everything
from
the
temporary
folder
you
created
in

into
the
new
system
folder
if
youre
asked
if
you
want
to
replace
anything
you
forgot
to
take
something
out
in

youll
need
to
replace
things
individually
until
you
find
the
duplicate
piece
reinstall
any
fonts
or
das
you
removed
in
step
reboot
you
should
now
have
a
clean
defragmented
system
file
that
takes
up
less
memory
and
disk
space
and
a
much
more
stable
system
overall
disk
utilities
much
like
system
files
hard
disks
have
data
structures
that
occasionally
become
corrupted
affecting
performance
and
even
causing
data
loss
apple
includes
disk
first
aid
a
simple
utility
for
detecting
and
repairing
hard
disk
problems
with
its
system
disks
its
also
available
for
anonymous
ftp
from
ftpapplecom
in
the
directory
dtsmacsyssofthdsc
even
if
you
have
an
earlier
version
you
should
get
the
latest
version
from
ftpapplecom
and
run
it
on
all
your
hard
disks
several
companies
have
released
payware
disk
utilities
that
detect
and
repair
considerably
more
problems
than
disk
first
aid
though
interestingly
none
of
them
detect
and
repair
everything
that
disk
first
aid
does
the
three
most
effective
for
general
work
are
central
points
mactools
deluxe
fifth
generations
public
utilites
and
symantecs
norton
utilities
for
the
macintosh
a
department
or
work
group
should
have
all
of
these
as
well
as
disk
first
aid
since
none
of
them
fix
everything
the
others
do
for
individuals
mactools
street
is
about
half
the
price
of
norton
street
or
public
utilities
street
so
features
and
ease
of
use
being
roughly
equal
i
recommend
mactools
all
of
these
products
occasionally
encounter
problems
they
cant
fix
when
that
happens
its
time
to
backup
and
reformat
backing
up
this
is
one
part
of
preventative
maintenance
that
should
be
done
a
lot
more
often
than
every
three
months
the
simplest
back
up
is
to
merely
copy
all
the
files
on
your
hard
disk
onto
floppies
or
other
removable
media
if
you
keep
your
data
files
separate
from
your
application
and
support
files
then
its
easy
to
only
back
up
those
folders
which
change
frequently
nonetheless
every
three
months
you
should
do
a
complete
backup
of
your
hard
disk
a
number
of
programs
are
available
to
make
backing
up
easier
apple
included
a
very
basic
full
backup
application
with
system
with
the
performas
apple
ships
a
new
apple
backup
utility
that
can
backup
the
entire
disk
or
just
the
system
folder
onto
floppies
the
previously
mentioned
norton
utilities
for
the
mac
and
mactools
deluxe
include
more
powerful
floppy
backup
utilities
that
incorporate
compression
and
incremental
backups
finally
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
a
tape
drive
network
server
or
removable
media
device
to
use
for
backups
you
should
check
out
the
more
powerful
payware
utilities
redux
street
doesnt
support
tape
drives
and
diskfit
pro
street
there
are
no
freely
available
backup
utilities
other
than
the
old
hd
backup
from
system
disk
defragmentation
as
disks
fill
up
it
gets
harder
and
harder
to
find
enough
free
space
in
the
same
place
to
write
large
files
therefore
the
operating
system
will
often
split
larger
files
into
pieces
to
be
stored
in
different
places
on
your
hard
disk
as
files
become
more
and
more
fragmented
performance
can
degrade
there
are
several
ways
to
defragment
a
hard
disk
the
most
tedious
but
cheapest
method
is
to
backup
all
your
files
erase
the
hard
disk
and
you
might
as
well
reformat
while
youre
at
it
see
question
and
restore
all
the
files
a
number
of
payware
utilities
including
norton
utilities
for
the
mac
and
mac
tools
deluxe
can
defragment
a
disk
in
place
ie
without
erasing
it
although
the
ads
for
all
these
products
brag
about
their
safety
once
youve
bought
the
software
and
opened
the
shrinkwrap
they
all
warn
you
to
back
up
your
disk
before
defragmenting
it
in
case
something
does
go
wrong
there
are
no
freeware
or
shareware
disk
defragmenters
so
please
dont
annoy
the
net
by
asking
for
one
reformat
your
hard
disk
just
as
a
floppy
disk
needs
to
be
initialized
before
use
so
a
hard
disk
must
be
formatted
before
it
can
hold
data
you
dont
need
to
reformat
every
three
months
but
when
your
system
is
crashing
no
matter
what
you
try
reformatting
is
the
ultimate
means
of
wiping
the
slate
clean
reformatting
your
hard
disk
may
even
gain
you
a
few
extra
megabytes
of
space
not
all
hard
disks
are
created
equal
some
can
hold
more
data
than
others
to
facilitate
mass
production
and
advertising
without
a
lot
of
asterisks
megabytes
is
the
average
formatted
capacity
your
mileage
may
vary
apple
often
formats
drives
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
drive
capacity
when
you
reformat
theres
no
reason
at
all
not
to
reclaim
whatever
unused
space
apples
left
on
your
disk
unlike
floppies
hard
disks
need
a
special
program
to
initialize
them
most
hard
disks
come
with
formatting
software
apples
disks
and
system
software
ship
with
hd
sc
setup
a
minimal
disk
formatter
which
will
format
apple
brand
hard
drives
only
most
other
manufacturers
ship
appropriate
formatting
software
with
their
hard
drives
normally
this
will
be
all
you
need
to
reformat
your
hard
disk
a
number
of
generalpurpose
formatters
are
also
available
which
go
beyond
the
bundled
software
to
include
features
like
encryption
password
protection
multiple
partitioning
faster
disk
access
system
compatibility
and
even
compression
two
of
the
best
are
the
payware
drive
and
hard
disk
toolkit
personal
edition
street
for
either
while
there
are
one
or
two
freeware
formatters
available
none
are
likely
to
be
superior
to
the
ones
bundled
with
your
hard
disk
powerbook
users
should
be
sure
to
turn
off
sleep
and
processor
cycling
before
reformatting
their
hard
drives
no
matter
what
software
they
use
otherwise
disk
corruption
crashes
and
data
losses
are
a
very
good
possibility
