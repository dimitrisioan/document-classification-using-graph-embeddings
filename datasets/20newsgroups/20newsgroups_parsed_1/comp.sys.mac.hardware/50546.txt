were
all
set
to
buy
one
of
these
for
the
office
to
use
for
scanning
in
color
photographs
and
for
optical
character
recognition
weve
played
with
the
original
grayscale
onescanner
and
were
very
pleased
is
the
color
model
comparable
in
quality
also
what
brand
of
ocr
software
would
you
recommend
were
leaning
toward
caere
omnipage
any
better
ideas
thanks
i
work
in
a
campus
bookstore
and
we
had
the
opportunity
to
demo
the
color
one
scanner
i
found
it
to
be
very
impressive
as
well
as
affordable
with
the
educational
discount
of
course
note
also
that
it
comes
with
ofoto
software
which
is
sufficient
for
our
needs
