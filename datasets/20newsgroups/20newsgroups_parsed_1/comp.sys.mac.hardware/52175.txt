they
are
not

on

use
of

computers
alone
are
believed
to
account
for
five
percent
of
commercial
electricity
consumption
and
may
account
for
ten
percent
by
the
year
if

leave
them
on

it
would
be
a

if

just
turn
it

it
only
takes
a
second
or
two
to

has
formed
an
alliance
with
computer
manufacturers
to
promote
the
introduction
of
energy
efficient
pcs
that
power
down
automatically
when
not
being
used
and
thus
reduce
the
air
pollution
caused
by
power
generation
these
new
computers
will
save
enough
electricity
to
power
both
vermont

save
up
to
billion

look

when

they
should
be

according

saved
will
prevent
co
emissions
of
million

annually
the
equivalent
of
five
million

also
tons
of
