excuse
me
if
this
is
a
frequent
question
i
checked
in
several
faqs
but
couldnt
really
find
anything
you
are
excused
the
answer
varies
from
mac
to
mac
so
it
would
be
a
complex
answer
in
the
faq
i
have
a
iisi
with
the
standard
meg
memory
and
i
want
need
to
add
additional
memory
but
im
on
a
budget
i
really
dont
need
more
than
meg
max
so
what
is
the
best
performance
wise
and
most
economical
way
to
do
this
someone
told
me
that
i
should
only
use
simms
of
the
same
amount
of
memory
that
is
meg
meg
etc
what
if
i
just
wanted
to
buy
just
meg
and
use
the
rest
of
what
i
already
have
the
manual
hasnt
been
very
helpful
with
this
the
si
uses
a
bit
wide
data
bus
and
therefore
you
must
use
bit
wide
simms
sorry
but
no
short
cuts
here
thanks
youre
quite
welcome
