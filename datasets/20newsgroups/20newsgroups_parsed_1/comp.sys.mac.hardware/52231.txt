question
hi
there
i
have
a
mac
lc
and
consider
buying
cd
ive
been
told
however
that
the
double
speed
of
cd
is
achievable
only
on
machines
with
scsi
the
double
speed
is
a
prerequisite
for
photocd
multisession
capability
which
i
need
which
means
i
seem
to
gain
nothing
compared
with
say
cd
any
comments
thanx
