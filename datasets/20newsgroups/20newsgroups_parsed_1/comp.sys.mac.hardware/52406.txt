hey
all
we
have
an
old
external
hd
attached
to
the
plus
in
our
lab
it
had
given
us
flawless
service
until
last
week
the
problem
someone
in
our
lab
has
an
old
that
was
upgraded
a
couple
years
ago
to
a
plus
with
an
aftermarket
simmscsi
setup
digigraphics
simmer
the
db
scsi
plug
runs
through
the
back
of
the
machine
and
attaches
to
the
board
with
a
pin
rectangular
connector
well
this
guy
had
removed
the
back
from
the
machine
to
put
more
memory
in
and
had
disconnected
the
the
scsi
plug
since
the
pin
connector
is
symmetrical
not
keyed
he
may
have
reinstalled
it
upside
down
essentially
reversing
the
pins
on
the
db
he
came
in
and
asked
if
he
could
try
out
our
hd
on
his
scsi
port
it
had
never
been
used
naive
fools
that
we
are
we
said
ok
his
computer
failed
to
recognize
the
drive
now
none
of
the
computers
in
our
lab
will
recognize
it
we
tried
disk
doctor
and
it
doesnt
recognize
anything
on
the
scsi
chain
could
installing
the
scsi
upside
down
have
wrecked
the
hds
driver
board
the
drive
seems
to
spin
up
all
right
and
unpark
itself
upon
powerup
the
events
are
too
coincidental
to
attribute
the
problem
to
stiction
any
help
greatly
appreciated
