request
info
on
floptical
drives
im
considering
adding
a
floptical
drive
to
my
current
system
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
which
floptical
drives
are
recommended
for
their
quality
and
performance
my
preference
would
be
floptical
drives
capable
of
handling
both
k
and
k
floppies
but
handling
k
floppies
is
not
a
necessity
so
far
i
only
know
a
bit
about
the
iomega
floptical
and
the
infinity
floptical
drives
are
there
any
commentsrecommendations
for
either
of
these
are
there
any
other
floptical
drives
that
are
worth
looking
into
and
where
can
they
be
purchased
ie
which
mail
order
places
etc
thanks
in
advance
please
send
