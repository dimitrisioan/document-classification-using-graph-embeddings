slowdowns
i
am
currently
managing
among
many
other
labs
a
lab
with
three
lc
iis
a
mac
plus
with
mb
external
hd
and
a
laserwriter
ii

my
problem
the
lc
iis
seem
to
intermittently
slow
to
a
snails
pace
these
lc
iis
have
mb
ram
k
vram
and
a
quantum
lps
hd
installed
i
have
reformatted
the
drive
with
hard
disk
toolkit
and
it
gives
a
very
respectable
overall
rating
to
this
drive
so
its
not
the
drive
i
have
reinstalled
system
msword
a
msworks
and
so
on
all
from
the
master
disks
in
short
i
have
done
everything
i
can
think
of
in
software
i
am
not
a
hardware
hacker
though
i
pop
cases
fairly
often
but
nothing
works
the
problem
is
intermittent
and
unpredictable
the
mouse
always
moves
smoothly
floppies
always
run
at
the
same
speed
but
occasionally
for
about
hours
at
a
time
a
machine
will
run
like
it
was
running
on
a
mhz
not
a
mhz
it
is
very
frustrating
and
makes
it
nearly
unusable
it
does
seem
to
worsen
with
increasing
disk
activity
has
anyone
encountered
this
problem
before
has
anyone
got
any
ideas
they
would
be
much
appreciated
