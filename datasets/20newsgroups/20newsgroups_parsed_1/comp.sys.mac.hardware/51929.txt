re
cache
card
for
iisi
as
of
last
week
macs
place
had
the
applied
engineering
quicksilver
card
k
cache
one
pds
slot
socket
for
fpu
on
sale
for
without
fpu
regular
price
is
no
idea
if
this
is
still
going
on
but
i
can
get
the
phone
no
if
anyone
is
interested
i
found
their
ad
in
macuser
can
some
people
with
cache
cards
please
post
speedometer
numbers
they
get
with
the
cards
i
have
only
one
report
which
seems
to
indicate
that
a
k
cache
card
gives
you
only
about
a
speedup
access
to
memory
takes
longer
when
you
have
a
cache
cardand
get
a
miss
thus
a
small
cache
card
of
k
may
be
worth
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
numbers
k
cards
get
you
also
i
found
it
interesting
that
you
can
disable
the
cache
cards
via
softwareread
about
it
in
the
mac
iisi
tech
notes
from
ftpapplecom
so

a
good
deal
or
not
i
still
dont
know
