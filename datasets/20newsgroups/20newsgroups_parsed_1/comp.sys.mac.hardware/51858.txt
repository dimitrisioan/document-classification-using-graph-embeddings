re
accelerating
the
macplus
also
if
someone
would
recommend
another
accelerator
for
the
macplus
id
like
to
hear
about
it
thanks
for
any
time
and
effort
you
expend
on
this
karl
try
looking
at
the
brainstorm
accelerator
for
the
plus
i
believe
it
is
the
best
solution
because
of
the
performance
and
price
why
spend
upgrading
a
computer
that
is
only
worth
the
brainstorm
accelerator
is
around
it
speeds
up
the
internal
clock
speed
to
mhz
that
may
not
seem
like
much
but
it
also
speeds
up
scsi
transfers
i
think
that
feature
is
unique
to
brainstorm
check
it
out
