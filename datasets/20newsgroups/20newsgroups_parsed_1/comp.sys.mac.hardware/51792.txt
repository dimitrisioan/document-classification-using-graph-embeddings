is
it
possible
ie
via
creative
cable
splicing
or
whatever
to
hook
a
syquest
mb
removable
drive
to
a
mac
is
there
any
difference
with
the
guts
of
the
drive
or
is
it
just
cable
differences
thanks
their
should
be
no
difference
in
the
drive
itself
between
ibmpc
and
mac
the
two
main
differences
are
the
formatting
of
the
disk
itself
but
with
the
correct
software
each
can
read
the
others
and
maybe
the
cable
depends
on
your
scsi
board
on
ibmpc
if
you
get
some
mac
softawre
to
allow
mounting
of
any
ibmformatted
disk
and
the
correct
cable
you
should
br
able
to
mount
and
read
your
ibmpc
syquest
good
luck
