i
have
an
ethernet
card

i
took
out
off
an
old
lc
the

is
manufactured

the
card
has
an
fpu
socket
on
it
it
provides
thin
ethernet
connector
and
theres
another
connector
on
it
which
resembels
to
phone
connectors
my
questions
are
will
this
card
work
on
any
other
model
than
lcserie
given
that
its
a
pds
card
will
it
work
with
the
iisi
pds
slot
i
think
there
may
be
a
probleme
because
the
lc
has
bit
wide
slots
it
probably
wont
work
with
any
other
lc
the
ones
i
have
for
the
lc
ii
are
rev
d
no
it
wont
work
in
the
iisis
pds
slot
since
its
a
pds
while
the
lc
has
the
pds
the
iisi
and
se
share
the
same
kind
of
card
whats
that
other
conncetor
on
the
card
thats
the
baset
ethernet
connector
