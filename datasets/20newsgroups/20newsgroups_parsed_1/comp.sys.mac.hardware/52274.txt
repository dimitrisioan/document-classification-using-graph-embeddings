a
lot
of
the
time
when
youre
dealing
with
someone
who
has
no
financial
interest

opinion
as
opposed
to
factual
information
etc

it
sounds
like
to
me
is
that
this
guy
has
had
an
experience
with
one
flaky

an
allencompassing
opinion
on
the
rest
of
the
s
ive
seen
lots
of
yes
that
is
what
it
sounds
like
to
me
too
but
before
i
spend
da
bucks

want
to
make
sure

do
have
email
from
a
selfconfessed
applehater
listing
a
few
common
problems
with
the

cant
get
fixed
