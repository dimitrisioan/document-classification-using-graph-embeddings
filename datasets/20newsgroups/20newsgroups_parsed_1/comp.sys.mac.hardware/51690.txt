for
sale
update
hello
fellow
humans
and
other
net
creatures
if
youre
at
all
interested
in
this
merchandise
please
email
me
im
compacting
my
system
and
moving
to
a
single
monitor
system
so
i
have
two
monitors
and
cards
for
sale
nothing
at
all
is
wrong
with
these
pieces
im
just
wanting
to
conserve
desk
space
and
get
all
of
my
info
from
one
screen
id
prefer
to
sell
to
people
near
austin
and
surrounding
areas
within
driving
distance
like
an
hour
away
perhaps
but
i
can
ship
to
you
if
you
dont
live
near
here
only
problem
is
that
i
didnt
keep
the
original
boxes
for
the
monitors
but
im
confident
that
my
few
months
of
fulltime
service
in
the
shipping
room
will
enable
me
to
safely
package
the
monitors
and
flip
it
in
your
direction

card
sold
sony
color
monitor
whats
to
say
it
got
top
ratings
in
last
years
macuser
report
its
a
sony
trinitron
arguably
the
best
but
id
rather
not
argue
that
point
its
a
great
monitor
in
great
shape
but
im
going
to
a
bigger
screen
and
although
id
like
to
keep
it
finances
dont
justify
it
still
selling
for
at
macland
where
i
bought
it
originally
not
including
shipping
will
sell
for
plus
shipping
again
make
an
offer
if
that
sounds
unreasonable
