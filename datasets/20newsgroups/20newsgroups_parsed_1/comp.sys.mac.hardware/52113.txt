re
quadra
clock
chip
followup
i
have
replaced
the
osz
to
mhz
yesterday
and
no
truble
at
all
my
quadra
now
works
at
mhz
stable
for
more
than
hours
i
have
also
tried
a
mhz
osz
but
after
hour
my
quadra
died
i
am
not
sure
what
was
the
reason
for
that
but
it
is
to
risky
to
run
it
to
fast
most
of
your
quadras
should
work
at
mhz
without
any
problems
but
a
safety
tip
do
a
backup
from
your
harddisk
befor
you
start
to
upgrade
during
my
mhz
test
i
damaged
my
harddisk
and
had
a
hardtime
to
get
it
working
again
so
once
again
do
a
backup
befor
you
start
now

very
interesting
are
the
graphics
results
graphics
couldnt
belief
this
but
it
is
true
two
points
which
my
cause
problems
are
the
mbyte
ram
solder
on
the
board
the
are
only
ns
rams
and
run
at
the
upperlimit
with
mhz
the
next
part
which
may
cause
trouble
are
the
video
rams
i
have
the
orignal
ns
vrams
from
apple
in
my
quadra
here
you
are
also
at
the
upperlimit
where
most
of
the
chips
running
but
it
isnt
garantied
to
run
most
of
the
other
parts
on
the
quadra
board
running
on
there
o
wn
clockspeed
so
they
wont
make
truble
the
most
importaned
question
is
do
i
neat
a
new
heat
sink
i
would
say
no
after
running
my
quadra
for
more
than
hours
the
heat
sink
is
really
cool
a
mhz
with
heat
sink
is
mutch
warmer
than
the
in
the
quadra
so
i
didnt
see
any
problems
the
room
temperatur
was
celsius
f
if
you
living
in
a
area
were
it
is
hot
f
c
and
your
room
temperatur
is
not
mutch
below
i
would
suggest
a
new
heat
sink
with
a
ventilator
to
stay
on
the
safe
side
hope
you
will
have
the
same
success
than
i
had
rainer
