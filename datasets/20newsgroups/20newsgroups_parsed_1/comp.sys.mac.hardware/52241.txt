quickdraw
gx
is
not
a
replacement
for
quickdraw
the
two
of
them
live
quite
happily
together
you
may
write
an
app
that
only
uses
gx
if
you
want
or
you
may
write
a
hybrid
app
that
uses
both
suptayoo
this
is
something
i
asked
before
but
i
dont
think
i
got
an
answer
or
maybe
i
lost
the
answer
or
maybe
its
just
an
obvious
question
will
the
gx
stuff
online
docs
etc
be
available
on
the
develop
cds
or
will
it
only
go
out
to
people
in
the
developers
program
and
such
just
curious
