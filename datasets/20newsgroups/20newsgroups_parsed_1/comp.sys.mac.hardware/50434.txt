could
someone
post
a
definitive
answer
about
the
vram
configuration
for
the
q
and
presumably
the
c
and
c
as
well
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
confusion
about
this
issue
id
like
to
know
what
kind
of
simms
are
the
vram
simms
ie
pin
etc
theres
only
one
physical
size
for
vram
simms
unlike
dram
simms
which
come
in
many
many
sizes
and
pinouts
although
they
do
come
with
differing
amounts
of
vram
on
them
the
ones
you
need
are
kb
simms
are
organized
as
k
x
and
have
two
k
x
vram
chips
on
them
this
is
the
only
size
which
the
quadra
and
centris
machines
can
use
how
many
vram
simm
slots
are
there
two
what
rules
if
any
must
be
followed
in
filling
the
slots
eg
in
pairs
sizes
must
match
etc
both
simm
slots
must
be
filled
putting
a
simm
in
only
one
slot
does
nothing
for
you
how
fast
must
they
be
ns
for
the
q
and
c
ns
for
the
c
is
there
any
other
relevant
information
there
are
certain
vram
chip
manufacturers
whose
parts
are
not
compatible
with
the
quadra
and
centris
video
hardware
make
sure
that
the
source
you
get
them
from
guarantees
compatiblity
in
general
if
it
works
in
a
q
it
will
work
in
a
q
please
dont
reply
unless
you
have
the
correct
information
many
thanks
in
advance
for
helping
to
eliminate
some
noise
