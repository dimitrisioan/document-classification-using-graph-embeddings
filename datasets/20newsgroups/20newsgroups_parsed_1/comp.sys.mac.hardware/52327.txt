this
is
a
bad
idea
my
machine
is
on
hours
a
day
but
its
actually
doing
things
hours
a
day
i
use
it
as
an
all
purpose
alarm
clock
scheduler
ive
got
routines
that
run
in
the
middle
of
the
night
phone
calls
it
makes
during
the
day
when
im
out
if
your
machine
is
on
hours
a
day
then
you
can
count
on
it
to
be
working
hours
a
day
i
could
call
it
from
work
and
download
a
file
that
i
might
need
i
could
call
it
from
work
and
have
it
turn
the
lights
on
if
im
going
to
be
late
oops
more
wasted
electricity
but
conversely
i
could
have
it
turn
the
lights
off
heck
i
suppose
i
could
even
connect
the
microwave
and
have
dinner
ready
when
i
get
there
oh
well
nevermind
im
just
babbling
all
of
those
things
that
youve
mention
can
still
be
accomplished
when
the
machine
is
power
down
when
the
previous
poster
said
power
down
it
doesnt
mean
turning
off
the
machine
it
just
means
that
the
machine
is
in
an
energy
conserving
mode
that
sucks
up
least
electricity
