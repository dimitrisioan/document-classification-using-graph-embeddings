ive
noticed
an
interesting
phenomenon
on
my
centris
if
i
unplug
the
keyboard
and
mouse
and
plug
them
in
again
without
turning
the
power
off
the
mouse
suddenly
switches
to
about
half
its
normal
movement
speed
i
check
the
mouse
control
panel
and
theres
no
change
in
its
setting
thereits
still
on
full
speed
the
way
i
like
it
restarting
the
machine
restores
the
normal
mouse
speed
by
the
way
it
happens
with
both
the
newerstyle
mouse
that
came
with
the
centris
and
the
olderstyle
mouse
from
my
iifx
at
work
thus
i
dont
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
resolution
setting
in
the
mouseits
definitely
a
quirk
of
the
adb
interface
either
hardware
or
software
in
the
centris
itself
i
have
noticed
this
exact
same
phenomenon
occurs
with
my
lciii
perhaps
it
is
a
quirk
of
the
new
machines
