cache
card
and
optimum
memory
settings
heres
a
question
that
may
be
simple
enough
to
answer
but
has
stumped
myself
and
a
few
others
what
does
an
external
ram
cache
card
do
for
you
if
you
already
have
a
large
cache
set
through
control
panel
in
your
simms
ex
i
have
a
mac
iici
with
meg
ram
an
external
video
card
so
i
dont
rob
my
simms
and
the
default
apple
cache
card
i
believe
this
is
k
say
i
have
my
cache
set
at
meg
what
good
does
a
measly
k
do
me
on
the
cache
card
could
it
actually
slow
things
down
by
dividing
the
cache
between
the
card
and
the
simms
or
does
it
still
speed
things
up
by
providing
a
secondary
staging
area
for
data
normally
passed
directly
into
the
simm
ram
cache
im
confused
because
it
seems
like
cache
cards
are
so
low
in
memory
to
really
do
any
good
compared
to
what
you
can
set
yourself
yet
daystar
fastcache
has
numbers
which
show
around
a
performance
boost
on
some
operations
are
the
chips
on
the
cache
card
simply
faster
than
most
simm
accesses
please
help
im
trying
to
find
the
optimum
memory
settings
for
the
iici
system
described
in
the
ex
above
