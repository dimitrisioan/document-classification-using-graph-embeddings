hi
what
alternatives
to
the
express
modem
do
duo
owners
have
if
they
want
to
go
at
least
baud
every
place
in
town
says
they
are
back
ordered
and
part
of
the
reason
i
want
a
laptop
mac
is
so
i
can
use
it
as
a
remote
terminal
from
wherever
i
am
but
i
really
would
hate
to
have
to
wait
months
to
get
a
modem
in
or
have
to
settle
with
baud
if
apple
didnt
put
out
such
a
good
product
id
gladly
take
my
business
to
to
the
bit
ataris
i
think
the
situation
with
the
express
modem
is
inexusable
for
any
business
ive
had
mine
on
order
since
january
apple
finally
called
me
last
week
to
tell
me
that
i
should
have
it
by
the
second
week
of
may
in
the
meantime
ive
been
stuck
with
my
duo
without
the
connectability
i
needed
it
for
im
sure
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
can
bite
back
at
me
citing
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
apple
is
right
or
at
least
justified
but
im
just
a
crabby
consumer
and
when
i
order
a
duo
with
modem
thats
the
product
i
expect
oh
well
its
not
like
its
limited
to
the
computer
biz
remember
when
the
miata
came
out
what
about
those
cabbage
patch
dolls
well
i
want
my
toy
