i
have
a
strange
problem
with
my
apple
monitor
which
hopefully
someone
can
shed
some
light
on
i
would
be
using
my
computer
for
minutes
and
then
the
screen
would
go
blank
as
if
someone
has
switch
the
monitor
off
after
the
screen
went
off
i
would
not
be
able
to
turn
the
monitor
off
even
if
i
turn
the
power
off
and
back
on
i
will
have
to
let
the
monitor
sit
over
night
and
it
usually
turns
on
although
it
doesnt
stay
on
for
very
long
dooes
anybody
has
similar
experience
with
such
a
problem
before
is
there
some
fuse
in
the
monitor
that
prevents
it
from
turning
on
when
i
try
to
turn
the
monitor
on
it
seems
that
the
monitor
tries
to
turn
on
but
it
prevented
by
some
mechamism
in
certain
apple
rgb
monitors
there
has
been
a
problem
with
the
high
voltage
capasitor
apple
knows
about
this
problem
and
is
replacing
the
cap
at
no
cost
if
it
falls
into
the
bad
batch
that
they
got
from
their
supplier
your
local
repair
shop
should
know
about
repair
extension
