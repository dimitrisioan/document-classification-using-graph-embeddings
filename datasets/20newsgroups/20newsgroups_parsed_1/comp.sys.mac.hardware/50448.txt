vs
control
wasre
apple
keyboard
please
excuse
and
redirect
me
if
this
has
already
been
answered
but
is
there
a
small
utility
that
switches
the
functionality
of
the
capslock
key
and
the
ctrl
key
on
the
powerbook
keyboard
i
use
the
ctrl
key
far
more
than
capslock
so
it
would
be
more
convenient
and
comfortable
thank
