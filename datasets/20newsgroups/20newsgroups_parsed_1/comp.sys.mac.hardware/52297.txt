those
chimes
indicate

failure
of
some
type
during

startup
one
thing
that
can
cause
the
chimes
is
a
cable
that
has
become
a
bit
loose
next
time
you
power
down
the
computer
check
that
all
cables
are
on
tight
i
remember
a
simple
program
that
would
play
those
chimes
for
you
when
you
clicked
their
respective
buttons
does
anyone
know
where
that
is
this
was
circa
