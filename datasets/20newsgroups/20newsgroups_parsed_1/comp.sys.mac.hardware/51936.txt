good
harddisk
driver
for
nonapple
drives
sys
compat
hi
there
what
is
your
recommendation
for
a
good
harddisk
driver
software
for
nonapple
drives
i
would
mainly
need
it
for
a
syquest
removable
media
drive
but
maybe
for
some
normal
drives
too
i
have
heard
and
seen
good
things
about
silverlining
but
dont
know
any
competitors
it
does
not
need
to
be
fancy
filled
with
features
i
more
like
it
affordable
thanks
jartsu
