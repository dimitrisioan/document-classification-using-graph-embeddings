the
fastest
quickdraw
color
performing
computer
apple
makes
is
the
drumroll
please
lciii
and
the
color
classic
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
quadra
line
the
centris
line
pales
in
comparison
does
anybody
know
the
differences
in
these
computers
that
explains
the
disparity
in
graphicsprocessor
performance
i
think
you
are
suffering
from
some
alignment
or
color
table
or
whatever
problems
if
a
color
classic
is
as
fast
as
a
quadra
rendering
to
screen
what
screen
card
you
use
does
of
course
matter
much
builtin
video
is
almost
always
faster
than
nubus
or
you
measured
scroll
entire
screen
where
the
color
classic
had
a
vram
screen
in
bit
color
and
the
quadra
had
a
bit
screen
on
nubus
