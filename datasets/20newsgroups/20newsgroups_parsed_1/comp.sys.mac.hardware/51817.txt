i
have
a
question
regarding
quadras
vram
i
have
tried
to
find
info
on
this
but
i
could
not
get
precise
answers
on
one
hand
we
have
a
quadra
with
a
monitor
which
is
capable
of
bit
color
how
much
vram
does
it
have
to
display
millions
of
colors
on
a
monitor
you
need
mb
of
vram
in
the
q
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
quadra
with
a
monitor
which
is
capable
of
bit
color
only
so
it
must
have
ko
of
vram
correct
this
is
the
amount
of
onboard
vram
that
the
q
comes
with
i
would
like
to
take
vram
simms
for
the
and
put
them
in
the
so
that
both
machines
have
bit
color
capability
is
it
possible
and
if
yes
how
many
vram
simms
should
i
take
from
the
yes
this
is
possible
technically
you
only
need
to
take
out
of
the
vram
simms
but
leaving
in
the
other
two
will
not
get
you
anything
because
the
can
not
really
do
anything
with
mb
of
vram
it
only
knows
mb
and
mb
from
the
documentation
i
have
the
quadra
must
get
mo
vram
to
have
bit
color
is
that
correct
yes
this
is
correct
you
get
to
mb
by
putting
k
vram
simms
into
the
vram
simm
slots
on
the
qs
motherboard
bonus
question
where
do
vram
simms
hide
from
the
documentation
they
seem
to
be
behind
the
power
supply
do
i
really
have
to
take
off
the
power
supply
to
access
the
vram
simms
yup
you
have
to
take
off
the
power
supply
its
only
a
couple
of
screws
so
you
should
be
ok
just
make
sure
that
everything
is
disconnected
from
it
and
watch
out
for
static
discharges
