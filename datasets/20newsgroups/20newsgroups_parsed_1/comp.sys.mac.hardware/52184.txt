get
with
the
apple
monitor

with
two
types
as
i

one
can
hook
up
the
power
cord
of
an
apple
monitor
to
the
back
of
a
machine
such
as
my
quadra
however
for
my
fathers
se
there
is
no
extra
plug
which
allows
use
of
the
ses
power
supply
he
needs
to
plug
it
into
the
socket
separately
sodoes
the
monitor
come
with
a
cable
that
will
allow
him
to
do
this
will
have
to
buy
a
different
cable
