subject
has
anyone
had
problems
with
ibm
drives
in
their
machines
hi
the
subject
line
says
it
all
my
system
acts
weird
at
times
all
of
a
sudden
the
system
will
be
corrupt
boot
blocks
will
get
chewed
etc
this
was
a
really
big
problem
for
a
while
i
couldnt
even
format
my
drive
properly
i
installed
hdts
driver
and
things
got
better
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
reinstall
the
system
could
an
incompatibility
exist
between
it
and
a
quantum
external
drive
im
looking
for
a
pure
hardware
solution
its
not
a
virus
bad
software
etc
could
i
have
a
bad
scsi
cable
or
is
the
ibm
wds
just
a
screwey
drive
thanks
