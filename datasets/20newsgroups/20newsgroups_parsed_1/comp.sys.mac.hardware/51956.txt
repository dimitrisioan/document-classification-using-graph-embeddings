how
do
they
compare
in
article
writes
the
real
question
here
in
my
opinion
is
what
motorola
processors
running
system
on
a
mac
are
comparable
to
what
intel
processors
running
windows
on
a
pc
i
recall
there
being
a
conversation
here
that
a
running
windows
benchmarks
at
about
the
same
speed
as
mhz
in
system
i
dont
know
if
that
is
true
but
i
would
love
to
hear
if
anyone
has
any
technical
data
on
this
david
that
seems
about
right
i
have
a
mac
iisi
with
k
cache
card
running
system
my
roommate
has
a
sx
running
windows
and
from
what
ive
seen
my
iisi
is
faster
in
some
operations
in
others
they
are
comparablebut
keep
in
mind
im
strictly
speaking
of
operations
on
the
desktop
level
of
windows
and
system
not
actual
computational
speed
in
other
programs
