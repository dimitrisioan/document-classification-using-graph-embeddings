i
need
to
get
an
apple
sc
tape
backup
unit
working
under
sys
x
but
do
not
have
any
driverssoftware
to
access
the
device
retrospect
dantz
works
nicely
with
this
combination
i
also
use
retrospect
but
i
noticed
that
central
point
softwares
mactools
backup
also
supports
the
apple
tape
drive
under
x
the
apple
tape
drive
is
quite
slow
so
the
advantages
of
retrospect
relative
to
the
simpler
mactools
backup
are
less
significant
than
might
be
the
case
for
someone
backing
up
a
large
server
to
a
dat
drive
used
apple
tape
drives
are
going
for
so
it
might
make
less
economic
sense
to
pay
an
extra
for
retrospect
when
mactools
is
cheaper
and
includes
other
worthwhile
utilities
retrospect
is
nice
though
and
im
probably
going
to
upgrade
