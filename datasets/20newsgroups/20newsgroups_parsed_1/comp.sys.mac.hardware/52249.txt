hi
there
i
have
a
mac
lc
and
consider
buying
cd
ive
been
told
however
that
the
double
speed
of
cd
is
achievable
only
on
machines
with
scsi
the
double
speed
is
a
prerequisite
for
photocd
multisession
capability
which
i
need
which
means
i
seem
to
gain
nothing
compared
with
say
cd
any
comments
thanx
your
source
is
wrong
the
double
speed
cd
is
still
slow
compared
to
a
typical
hard
disk
the
lc
can
easily
handle
the
scsi
transfer
rate
of
the
cd
none
of
the
current
macs
even
the
quadras
support
scsi
unless
you
get
a
scsi
nubus
card
you
dont
have
to
have
double
speed
to
use
photocd
its
just
faster
reading
images
off
of
a
disk
i
think
that
the
cd
can
handle
photocd
but
only
single
session
the
cd
can
do
multisession
photocd
