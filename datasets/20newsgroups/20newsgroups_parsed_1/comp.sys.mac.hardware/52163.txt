its
not
a
good
idea
to
have
a
horizontally
formatted
hard
disk
in
a
vertical
position
if
the
drive
is
formatted
in
a
horizontal
position
it
can
not
completely
compensate
for
the
gravitational
pull
in
a
vertical
position
i
asked
this
question
a
while
ago
while
contemplating
placing
my
on
its
side
i
received
a
response
from
someone
at
seagate
sorry
i
trashed
the
message
stating
that
most
newer
drives
seagates
at
the
least
can
very
well
compensate
for
gravity
this
means
that
a
horizontally
formatted
drive
can
be
later
placed
vertically
with
no
data
integrity
problems
so
is
there
any
problems
putting
a
drive
formatted
vertically
on
its
side
horizontally
i
got
a
drive
a
few
years
ago
with
the
rubber
feet
on
the
side
etc
and
have
used
it
like
that
since
obviously
designed
for
that
orientation
however
it
doesnt
fit
under
any
of
the
clever
places
i
can
think
of
to
place
it
so
i
would
really
like
to
lay
it
flat
and
put
it
under
a
low
shelf
this
is
probably
not
a
newer
drive
and
it
is
only
meg
but
when
i
bought
it
it
was
a
large
drive
for
an
average
user
comparable
to
buying
a
meg
drive
today
so
is
my
old
meg
drive
as
fragile
or
not
as
a
new
meg
drive
just
curious
