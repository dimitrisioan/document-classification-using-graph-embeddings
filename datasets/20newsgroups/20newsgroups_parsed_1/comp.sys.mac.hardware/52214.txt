re
apple
gc
video
card
a
friend
of
mine
recently
acquired
an
gc
card
for
his
iisi
and
was
wondering
why
it
always
starts
up
in
black
and
white
i
know
there
have
been
numerous
reports
about
the
worth
of
the
gc
but
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
elaborate
a
little
more
on
the
subject
any
replies
encouraged
thanks

ive
had
similar
problems
w
other
board
types
and
the
problem
is
not
a
result
of
the
gc
board
try
zapping
the
pram
by
holding
down
commandoptionpr
durring
startup
you
will
have
to
reset
everything
to
your
previous
preferences
the
date
time
remain
intact
but
the
video
board
will
start
remembering
its
previous
settings
