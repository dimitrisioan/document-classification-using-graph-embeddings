how
does
a
based
amiga
perform
in
daily
tasks
compared
to
my
based
iici
answer
except
in
a
very
few
cases
i
get
my
butt
kicked
by
the
amiga

similar
reason
is
why
people
at
work
used
to
seeing
sco
unix
running
on
a
are
suprised
when
they
see
my
sun
at
home
running
faster
wa
mhz
the
sun
was
designed
from
the
ground
up
for
unix
the
pc
wasnt
this
is
why
you
need
a
gargantuan
processor
to
run
windows
the
basic
design

all
wrong

been
better
if
ms
had
put
most
of
windows
on
a
plugin
rom
card
from
day
one
priced
at
or
so
people
woulda
loved
it
apple
had
the
right
idea
just
stumbled
a
bit
in
the
execution
