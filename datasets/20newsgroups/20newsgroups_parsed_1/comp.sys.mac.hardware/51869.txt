how

compare
the
real
question
here
in
my
opinion
is
what
motorola
processors
running
system
on
a
mac
are
comparable
to
what
intel
processors
running
windows
on
a
pc
i
recall
there
being
a
conversation
here
that
a
running
windows
benchmarks
at
about
the
same
speed
as
mhz
in
system
i
dont
know
if
that
is
true
but
i
would
love
to
hear
if
anyone
has
any
technical
data
