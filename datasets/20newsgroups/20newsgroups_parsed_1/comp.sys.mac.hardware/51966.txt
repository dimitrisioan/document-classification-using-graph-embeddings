hi
there
what
is
your
recommendation
for
a
good
harddisk
driver
software
for
nonapple
drives
i
would
mainly
need
it
for
a
syquest
removable
media
drive
but
maybe
for
some
normal
drives
too
fwb
distributes
hdt
personal
edition
hdt
hard
drive
toolkit
which
is
what
i
own
this
is
less
fancy
than
the
full
version
but
good
enough
for
what
you
and
i
want
to
do
casa
blanca
offers
drive
but
im
not
that
familiar
with
it
i
think
that
both
drive
and
hdt
pe
can
be
had
for
around
us
ive
used
silverlinging
at
work
v
and
i
like
hdt
pe
much
better
imho
it
has
a
better
interface
and
easier
to
understand
any
drive
users
