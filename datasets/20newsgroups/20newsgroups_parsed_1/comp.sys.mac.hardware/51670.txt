youve
heard
about
apples
great
new
customer
support
program
well
think
again
sometimes
the
only
real
support
out
there
is
what
apple
computer
users
can
give
to
each
other
for
another
example
read
on
in
the
march
th
issue
of
macweek
ric
ford
described
a
twoyear
effort
by
liam
breck
to
document
and
bring
to
apples
attention
a
problem
with
certain
defective
mice
at
random
the
switches
on
these
mice
stick
in
the
down
position
until
clicked
a
second
time
apparently
regardless
of
the
machine
they
are
used
with
or
the
system
software
involved
most
of
the
reported
problem
mice
were
manufactured
in
malaysia
and
have
an
fcc
id
of
bcga
youll
recognize
this
sticky
button
symptom
immediately
if
you
have
such
a
mouse
the
problem
is
intermittent
but
its
not
subtle
liam
breck
recently
gave
up
trying
to
document
this
problem
and
instead
suggested
that
people
contact
apples
customer
assistance
center
directly
macweek
p
when
i
called
apple
on
march
rd
and
described
my
defective
mouse
i
was
eventually
given
a
case
number
fy
and
told
apple
would
replace
this
mouse
even
though
it
is
a
few
months
out
of
warranty
after
waiting
for
three
weeks
i
called
back
today
wondering
where
my
new
mouse
was
this
time
i
was
told
that
apple
had
decided
the
serial
number
on
my
mouse
mbfc
is
not
within
the
undisclosed
range
apple
is
willing
to
replace
and
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
nothing
that
is
unless
enough
people
complain
about
this
problem
to
make
it
worth
apples
while
to
fix
or
replace
the
entire
lot
of
defective
mice
please
if
you
have
one
of
these
mice
i
need
your
help
dont
assume
you
know
what
causes
the
problem
there
are
lots
of
theories
and
start
hacking
around
inside
your
hundreddollar
mouse
instead
let
apple
do
it
please

victims
take
the
trouble
to
report

continues
to
find
it
easy
to
stonewall
on
this
issue
dont
expect
them
to
offer

when
the
next
potentially
more
serious
mac

is
uncovered
