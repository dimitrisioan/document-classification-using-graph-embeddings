re
put
ex
syquest
in
centris
ive
just
installed
a
tape
backup
in
my
c
lot
of
the
issues
are
the
same
so
to
answer
your
questions
in
article
writes
my
pli
m
syquest
drive
has
a
wire
from
the
drive
to
an
id
switch
on
the
outside
of
the
case
where
do
i
connect
this
switch
can
the
computer
just
tell
with
internal
drives
you
probably
want
to
hardwire
the
scsi
id
with
shorting
jumpers
put
it
at
a
convenient
number
like
you
could
cut
a
hole
in
the
back
of
the
machine
to
route
the
id
switch
but
why
go
through
the
hassle
you
probably
wont
be
needing
to
frequently
change
the
id
of
your
internal
drive
i
noticed
that
the
drive
will
lay
over
part
of
the
motherboard
i
didnt
look
closely
but
i
seem
to
recall
it
laying
over
the
ram
thats
soldered
onto
the
motherboard
would
that
cause
problems
yeah
when
i
first
installed
the
tape
drive
i
was
a
little
concerned
too
but
its
no
problem
the
device
is
designed
to
fit
just
fine
with
the
overhang
it
shouldnt
reach
back
beyond
the
romramvram
simms
though
one
last
question
is
there
anywhere
to
order
a
faceplate
cover
the
drives
front
panel
is
smaller
than
the
space
left
in
the
case
the
drives
panel
is
the
same
size
as
the
spotsbm
clones
cases
should
i
just
cut
a
hole
in
the
plastic
panel
that
is
currently
holding
tmpty
place
you
can
specialorder
parts
to
mount
the
device
from
your
local
apple
dealer
the
relevant
parts
are
blank
bezel
faceplate
cdrom
carrier
ie
generic
device
mounting
bracket
note
apples
unfortunate
choice
of
name
for
the
slidein
bracket
to
mount
a
device
the
service
techs
i
talked
to
said
oh
sure
we
stock
those
of
course
they
were
thinking
of
the
cd
caddies
to
hold
a
cd
disk
when
you
stick
it
in
the
drive
as
far
as
i
can
tell
apple
does
not
sell
a
bezel
faceplate
already
cut
out
for
a
standard
device
why
not
they
advertise
these
machines
as
being
able
to
accept
any
standard
device
in
the
bay
why
not
provide
the
faceplate
they
do
sell
a
cutout
for
their
cdrom
drive
of
course
but
thats
of
no
use
im
going
to
hack
up
the
extra
bezel
i
ordered
to
make
a
cutout
for
my
tape
drive
which
is
a
standard
device
good
luck
with
your
syquest
