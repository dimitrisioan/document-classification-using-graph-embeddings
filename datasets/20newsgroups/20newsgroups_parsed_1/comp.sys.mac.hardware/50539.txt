question
i
just
got
a
quadra
and
ive
noticed
that
i
cant
change
the
desktop

the
beautiful
gray
i
thought
maybe
i
should
reinstall
the
os
using
the
install
me
first
macintosh
centris
quadra
diskette
because
the
system
file
on
this
diskette
is
more
recent
than
the
one
on
the
hard
disk
the
easy
install
selects
macintosh
cnetris
system
software
does
anyone
know
if
i
should
use
this
or
customize
and
use
system
software
for
any
macintosh
or
does
it
matter
