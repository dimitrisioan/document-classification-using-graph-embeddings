a
new

appears
to
have
a
problem
waking
up
from
sleep
when
running
on
battery
power
when
woken
usually
for
the
second
time
after
sleeping
the
wake
fails
and
the
screen
appears
with
a
corrupted
image
of
broken
horizontal
lines
and
control
can
only
be
recovered
with
controlcommandpoweron
or
the
reset
key
at
the
back
of
the
machine
the
problem
occurs
even
when
the
system
is
stock
standard
no
extensions
no
virtual
memory
a
fully
charged
new
battery
system
etc
