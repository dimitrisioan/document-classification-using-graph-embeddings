has
anyone
out
there
in
netland
any
experience
with
accelerators
for
se
i
am
specially
interested
in
speed
up
rate
or
compared
to
eg
se
need
for
new
simms
speed
in
ns
maximum
ram
after
upgrade
compatibility
i
am
mainly
using
framemaker
can
i
use
an
additional
big
bw
screen
to
can
i
install
the
accellerator
myself
no
soldering
pricewhere
to
buy
i
have
no
experience
with
this
particular
hardware
but
just
about
every
month
in
macworld
there
is
an
add
for
an
combined
se
acceleratorvideo
board
this
item
sells
for
about
and
comes
with
a
mhz
pair
eight
simm
slots
and
a
grayscale
monitor
this
accelerator
plugs
into
the
ses
lone
expansion
port
and
thus
no
soldering
you
will
however
need
a
long
torx
wrench
to
get
the
case
open
but
thats
not
really
a
big
deal
does
that
sound
like
what
you
