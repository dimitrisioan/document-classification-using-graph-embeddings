theres
this
old
se
here
its
got
the
olderstyle
fans
that
remind
me
of
a
houseventilator
a
cylindrical
drum
instead
of
the
bladed
rotor
i
usually
see
anyway
the
se
makes
this
loud
buzzing
noise
due
to
vibration
somewheres
if
i
remove
the
screws
and
loosen
the
front
from
the
back
it
quiets
down
i
can
only
assume
that
the
fan
housing
from
this
goofy
thing
is
touching
the
back
of
the
case
and
vibrating
against
it
anyway
any
suggestions
for
where
to
get
replacement
fans
and
how
to
stealth
this
guy
your
experiences
welcome
if
everything
had
gone
as
planned
everything
would
have
been
perfect

spokesperson
on
cnn
regarding
failed
raid
attempt
in
tx
when
i
owned
an
se
i
replaced
the
fan
with
se
silencer
available
i
believe
from
macwarehouse
or
macconnection
it
comes
with
instruction
for
installation
and
requires
no
soldering
worked
like
a
charm
i
think
the
manufacturer
is
mobius
