alas
this
is
a
funny
system
it
sounds
like
a
good
deal
but
this
is
a

no
ethernet
and
no
coprocessor
well
actually
its
a
lc
instead
of
a
rc
just
had
to
say
that
to
keep
people
from
saying
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
without
a
coprocessor
since
the
fpu
is
built
into
the
chip
actually
there
such
a
thing
as
an
without
a
coprocessor
its
called
the
lc
this
is
a
redesign
of
the
full
which
people
are
calling
the
rc
although
i
have
been
told
by
a
number
of
people
that
motorola
doesnt
call
the
full
that
without
the
integrated
fpu
hardware
it
just
isnt
there
