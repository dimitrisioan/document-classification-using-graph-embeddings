can
anyone
tell
me
what
the
difference
is
between
a
k
dram
chip
and
a
k
simm
i
need
the
former
i
think
to
add
memory
to
my
laserwriter
ls
someone
is
offering
to
sell
me
k
simms
he
removed
from
an
se
but
i
have
a
feeling
this
may
not
be
the
correct
form
of
memory
the
sockets
in
the
laserwriter
look
like
they
want
the
spideryshaped
chips
there
are
sockets
each
with
as
i
recall
pins
arranged
in
two
rows
of
believe
it
or
not
ive
never
actually
seen
a
simm
help
appreciated
a
k
dram
chip
is
a
kilobit
chip
whereas
a
k
simm
is
a
kilobyte
memory
module
the
simm
is
a
pcb
with
a
pin
connector
edge
and
on
the
simm
are
kilobit
dram
chips
making
the
total
memory
kbytes
you
are
correct
assuming
that
simms
will
not
fit
into
a
laserwriter
apple
printers
either
require
pin
simms
like
those
in
the
mac
iifx
or
special
memory
chips
contact
your
apple
dealer
to
find
out
exactly
what
kind
of
chips
you
need
