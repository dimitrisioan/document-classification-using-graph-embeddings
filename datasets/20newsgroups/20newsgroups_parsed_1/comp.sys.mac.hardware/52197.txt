re
where
to
get
power
cord
to
plug
nonapple
monitor
into
quadra
power
supply
in
derek
a
fong
writes
is
there
an
extension
cord
type
cable
i
can
buy
which
allows
me
to
plug
my
existing
power
cord
into
and
then
plug
this
extension
cable
into
my
quadra
there
are
two
approaches
if
your
power
cord
is
the
kind
that
detaches
from
the
back
of
the
monitor
most
common
you
can
get
a
replacement
power
cord
that
will
go
from
the
monitor
to
the
back
of
the
computer
you
can
get
an
adpater
that
connects
to
the
plug
end
of
the
existing
power
cord
and
provides
the
proper
end
that
plugs
into
the
back
of
the
computer
both
cost
about
the
same
aprox
and
are
available
from
many
computer
stores
clone
dealers
are
usually
better
at
having
these
things
and
at
good
prices
power
cords
are
standard
so
you
dont
have
to
go
looking
for
some
special
thing
at
a
mac
store
