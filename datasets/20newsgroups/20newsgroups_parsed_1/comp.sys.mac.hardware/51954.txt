looking
for
magnetooptical
drive
advice
im
currently
trying
to
select
which
magnetooptical
drive
to
purchase
im
primarily
looking
at
mb
drives
although
i
might
consider
mb
ones
when
looking
through
macworld
and
macuser
ads
the
prices
for
the
mb
drives
seem
to
range
from
just
under
for
the
dgr
rem
portable
magic
mb
portable
fujitsu
or
nudesign
mb
from
macdirect
to
about
for
the
fwb
hammerdisk
and
mass
microsystems
datapak
mo
different
drives
use
different
mechanisms
most
fujitsu
sony
epson
probably
some
others
my
problem
is
that
after
reading
the
nov
macworld
and
apr
macuser
reviews
of
these
drives
im
still
not
sure
what
to
get
so
im
asking
if
anyone
has
had
goodbad
experiences
with
any
mb
mo
drive
or
can
shed
some
light
on
the
wide
range
of
prices
is
spending
more
really
buying
me
much
reliability
of
different
drives
compatibility
between
them
or
anything
else
i
should
probably
know
thanks
