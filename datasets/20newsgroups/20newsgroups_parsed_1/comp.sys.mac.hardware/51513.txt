yes
you
get
internal
mixing
of
the
analog
cdaudio
outputs
with
the
mac
generated
audio
on
the
mac
motherboard
also
you
can
sample
the
cdaudio
using
the
sound
control
panel
by
clicking
on
the
options
button
next
to
the
microphone
icon
whats
this
my
iivx
with
an
internal
cd
doesnt
have
any
cdaudio
icon
i
cant
find
any
such
option
on
my
centris
either
on
the
other
hand
i
dont
see
why
i
need
one
if
i
try
recording
sound
with
the
builtin
microphone
with
an
audio
cd
playing
in
the
drive
i
get
the
cd
audio
mixed
in
with
the
microphone
sound
and
i
guess
if
i
unplug
the
microphone
then
ill
get
uncontaminated
cd
audio
admittedly
sampled
at
bits
through
a
dad
conversion
sorry
about
the
misinformation
i
made
a
bad
assumption
about
the
new
machines
behaving
like
a
quadra
see
previous
post
about
sampling
the
cd
audio
though
have
you
tried
it
i
found
the
aliasing
to
be
really
bad
like
it
needed
a
filter
or
something
much
worse
than
i
expected
i
installed
the
cd
in
the
quadra
myself
so
maybe
i
missed
something
everything
else
works
great
though
