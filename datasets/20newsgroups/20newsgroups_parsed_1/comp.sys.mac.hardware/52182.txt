centris
clock
adjustment
i
was
reading
a
review
of
the
centris
in
this
months
macworld
and
the
reviewer
said
that
for
you
could
make
an
adjustment
on
the
clock
speed
of
the
chip
and
change
it
from
mhz
to
mhz
i
havent
heard
of
this
before
and
i
dont
think
that
this
is
the
chip
replacement
with
fpu
that
i
have
seen
so
much
talk
about
anyone
