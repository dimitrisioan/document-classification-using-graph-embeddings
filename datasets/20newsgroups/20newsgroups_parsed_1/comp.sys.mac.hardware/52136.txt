well
i
dont
exaclty
know
what
should
be
done
but
what
i
do
is
keep
my
cpu
on
and
turn
my
monitor
off
when
not
in
use
i
do
this
as
much
for
easing
power
consumption
as
anything
though
turning
off
the
monitor
when
not
in
use
has
the
advantage
of
requiring
less
ram
than
a
screen
saver
but
it
requires
more
of
my
memory
to
remember
to
turn
it
off
pretty
easy
to
remember
to
turn
it
on
though
