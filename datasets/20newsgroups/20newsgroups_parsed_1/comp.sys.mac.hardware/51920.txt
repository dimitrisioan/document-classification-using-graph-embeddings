quadra
clock
chipping
works
after
reading
reports
from
germany
of
success
in
accelerating
a
quadra
or
centris
simply
by
changing
the
clock
oscillator
i
decided
to
test
the
claim
i
pulled
out
my
variable
speed
overdrive
and
the
motherboards
mhz
clock
chip
i
put
a
socket
in
the
clocks
place
and
inserted
a
mhz
ttl
clock
oscillator
i
had
left
over
from
working
on
some
sis
i
cant
believe
it
it
actually
works
im
not
getting
scsi
timing
errors
either
this
is
only
after
a
short
run
time
but
ill
keep
posting
results
did
i
spend
all
that
money
on
the
vso
for
nothing
if
this
keeps
working
the
lack
of
a
double
boot
in
itself
will
be
worth
the
effort
guy
