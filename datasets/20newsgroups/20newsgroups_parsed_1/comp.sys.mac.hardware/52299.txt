flaky
large
memory
simms
on
s
in
the
last
two
weeks
i
have
the
following
problem
on
two
s
has
a
mb
simm
and
the
other
a
mb
simm
both
are
about
months
old
bought
from
different
vendors
and
installed
by
different
people
both
computers
begin
crashing
frequently
locking
up
and
ultimately
the
memory
chimes
crashes
would
almost
always
occur
if
you
moved
the
screen
and
sometimes
would
occur
when
you
werent
even
touching
the
computer
in
both
cases
taking
the
machine
apart
taking
the
memory
out
and
putting
it
back
in
solved
the
problem
for
awhile
but
then
it
would
comeback
my
marginally
educated
guess
as
to
whats
happening
is
that
larger
simms
are
lopsided
in
that
the
insertion
point
is
sort
of
a
pivot
point
and
after
time
they
begin
to
move
about
possible
because
of
pressure
on
the
keyboard
or
something
anyway
has
anyone
else
had
such
a
problem
or
solution
if
somehow
you
could
support
the
other
end
of
the
simm
to
prevent
it
from
moving
ive
had
no
problem
for
the
past
weeks
by
replacing
my
mb
simm
with
a
mbsimm
although
this
is
not
desireble
solution
please
email
any
resp
andor
post
if
usefull
to
the
rest
of
the
world
