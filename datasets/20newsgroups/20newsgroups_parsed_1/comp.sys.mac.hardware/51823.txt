sorry
if
this
is
a
faq
i
dont
normally
read
compsysmachardware
i
am
purchasing
a
couple
of
centris
s
i
configured
the
systems
as
follows
eight
mb
ram
ethernet
mb
vram
math
coprocessor
option
my
purchasing
agent
told
me
about
the
math
coprocessor
option
and
sent
me
the
apple
summary
documentation
to
prove
it
i
ordered
the
coprocessor
option
but
im
really
not
sure
that
we
needed
it
i
thought
the
chip
had
a
math
coprocessor
built
into
it
has
apple
had
a
math
coprocessor
chip
architectured
to
keep
up
with
the
speed
of
the
chip
in
the
centris
i
am
concerned
that
i
may
have
set
up
a
hardware
bottleneck
apple
has
really
confused
people
with
this
whole
thing
i
think
well
be
answering
this
question
for
about
the
next
year
or
so
there
is
no
option
to
get
an
fpu
on
a
c
what
you
have
is
a
choice
of
cpus
there
is
the
lc
that
does
not
have
an
integrated
fpu
like
the
full
and
is
only
present
in
the
base
model
of
the
c
appleusa
and
there
is
the
full
which
you
get
when
you
order
anything
other
than
the
base
configuration
therefore
since
you
have
ordered
one
of
the
mb
versions
with
onboard
ethernet
models
you
will
not
be
getting
the
lc
but
even
if
you
wanted
to
have
the
lc
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
order
a
c
with
mb
ram
onboard
ethernet
and
an
lc
its
not
an
option
also
a
note
to
people
out
there
that
have
cs
and
cs
thinking
that
there
is
an
optional
fpu
the
class
chip
can
not
recognize
an
external
fpu
so
there
is
no
socket
on
the
motherboard
for
a
fpu
chip
and
you
can
not
go
out
and
purchase
an
fpu
on
a
pds
card
or
something
like
that
the
only
way
to
get
an
fpu
in
these
machines
is
to
replace
the
lc
with
a
full
and
if
you
have
a
c
you
will
not
need
to
worry
about
a
heat
sink
if
you
do
replace
the
lc
with
the
full
but
if
you
have
a
c
you
do
need
to
have
a
heat
sink
