the
info
i
am
about
to
give
is
not
a
rumour
its
the
truth
the
new
macintosh
coming
in
the
second
quarter
will
have
a
cpu
of
their
own
excuse
me
but
have
not
all
macs
got
a
cpu
alain
alain
get
your
facts
straight
before
you
post
something
like
this
the
duo
dock
does
not
have
a
cpu
of
its
own
it
is
a
docking
station
with
ports
connecting
various
components
including
the
portable
powerbook
with
its
own
cpu
i
guess
these
rumored
new
duo
docks
have
a
builtin
cpu
to
perform
functions
of
their
own
interesting
if
theyre
not
compatible
with
the
current
duo
models
i
think
youll
be
hearing
a
lot
more
screwed
by
apple
complaints
imagine
a
company
obsoleting
ooh
a
new
verb
a
virtually
brand
new
computer
