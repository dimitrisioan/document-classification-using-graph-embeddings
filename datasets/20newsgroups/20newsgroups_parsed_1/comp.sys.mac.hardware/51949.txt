problems
i
recently
got
a
centris
on
my
desk
its
a
vast
improvement
on
my
previous
machine
a
iisi
however
ive
encountered
a
problem
with
fonts
entries
in
a
filemaker
database
which
looked
fine
when
printed
from
my
previous
mac
using
system
now
look
wierd
spacing
between
characters
has
increased
greatly
causing
lines
to
be
truncated
im
using
plain
and
bold
helvetica
in
various
sizes
the
increase
in
character
spacing
seems
to
occur
for
all
sizes
and
styles
im
using
a
mixture
of
truetype
and
fixedsize
fonts
exactly
as
on
my
iisi
when
things
worked
perfectly
weve
managed
to
get
similar
behaviour
using
word
apple
uk
adopted
their
usual
friendly
approach
and
told
us
to
call
our
local
dealer
god

a
