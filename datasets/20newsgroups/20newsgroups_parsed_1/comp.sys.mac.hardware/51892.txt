sorry
about
the
header
but
the
pnews
here
does
not
let
one
easily
change
the

and
i
gave
up
after
a

this

is
also
available
by

on

in
the

as

the
reason
for
this
general
data
sheet
is
to
consolidate
and
condense
the
information
out
there
so
that
people
in
both
camps
can
be
clear
and
accurate
about
what
they
are
saying
about
their
machines
since
computer
technology
is
always
changing
there
are
always
going
to
be
points
in
which
the
sheet
will
be
lacking
or
incorrect
on
information
so
please
just
dont
say
the
sheet
is
incomplete
or
incorrect
but
also
give
me
clear
and
concise
information
to
make
the
needed
corrections
all
prices
are
in
us
dollars
to
keep
this

sheet
organized
please
provide
if
possible
article
citations
for
the
information
provided
or
corrected
and
keep
the
opinions
to
a
minimum
as
this
is
a
general
data
sheet
keep
the
info
provided
simple
so
i
can
understand
what
is
being
talked
about
and
can
explain
it
to
others
finally
keep
the
information
relevant
to
the
section
corrected
for
example
os
code
in
rom
is
software
contained
in

so
no
more

but
many

in

more

its
also

printing
very
os
dependent
dos
if
its
a
single
user
then
you
plug
the
printer
into
the
parallel
port
and
dont
worry
about
it
tweeking
may
be
needed
with
poorly
written
software
network
printing
is
not
controlled
by
the
system
but
is
mostly
implemented
by
the
actual
program
therefore
performance
varies
from
one
software
program
to
the
next
windows
x
supports
standard
drivers
and
can
do
a
good
job
of
showing
jobs
in
the
print
queue
but
it
always
lists
printers
as
active
even
if
they
are
not
this
becomes
a
problem
if
there
are
several
incompatible
printers
on
the
same
net
because
theres
no
way
for
software
to
reliably
determine
which
printer
is
active
right
now
windows
for
workgroups
is
more
maclike
and
intelligent
about
this
os
maclike
the
os
deals
with
printers
with
apps
making
calls
to
the
os
printing
bugs
due
to
poor
programing
some

for
all
the
above
oses
do
not
have

this
is
the
fault
of
the
programs
in

and
not
that

the

involved
price
issue
this
is
very
dynamic
with

by

the
ibm
machines
modualar
nature
prevents
any
kind
of
true
hardware
standarization
which
in
turn
requires
oses
and
programs
to
be
very
complex
to
handle
all
the
