am
currently
managing

a

my
problem
the
lc
iis
seem
to
intermittently
slow
to
a
snails
pace
this
happens
intermittently
to
macs
in
our
department
ranging
from
iisis
to
a
quadra
i
can
end
the
slowdown
immediately
by
unplugging
the
ethernet
cable
from
the
mac
it
seems
that
something
on
the
network
puts
out
these
packet
storms
every
few
days
these
storms
have
the
effect
of
making
our
macs
slow
down
to
a
crawl
thank
you
very
much
these
computers
behave
exactly
like
what
youre
describing
now
my
question
i
am
running
on
the
lowest
of
all
budgets
public
education
how
can
i
analyze
this
all
i
need
is
some
sort
of
packet
counter
do
any
exist
and
where
are
they
thanks
again
