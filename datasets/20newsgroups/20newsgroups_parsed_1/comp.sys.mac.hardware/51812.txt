anyone
know
what
would
cause
my
iicx
to
not
turn
on
when
i
hit
the
keyboard
switch
the
one
in
the
back
of
the
machine
doesnt
work
either
the
only
way
i
can
turn
it
on
is
to
unplug
the
machine
for
a
few
minutes
then
plug
it
back
in
and
hit
the
power
switch
in
the
back
immediately
sometimes
this
doesnt
even
work
for
a
long
time
tj
this
problem
is
most
likely
the
same
that
all
cx
users
are
experiencing
thanks
to
one
very
adventurous
usenet
reader
sorry
i
cant
remember
the
guys
name
somebody
please
post

the
credit
for

all
it
is
easily
fixed
if
it
is
the
same
problem
best
i
can
figure
it
is
due
to
time
heat
and
repeated
warmupcool
downs
in
the
power
supplyie
bad
solder
joints
in
the
power
supply
circuit
card
go
get
a
desolder
tool
from
radio
shack
a
low
wattage
iron
and
some
good
nonacid
solder
and
resolder
the
lower
left
quadrant
of
the
circuit
card
with
the
ac
plugs
facing
away
from
youor
get
someone
to
do
it
for
you
it
took
me
less
then
minutes
and
saved
me
at
least
for
a
new
supply
