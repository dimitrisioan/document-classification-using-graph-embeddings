does
anyone
know
of
a
program
or
utility
that
will
enable
the
mac
to
read
unix
ie
next
in
disks
thanks
warren
i
dont
know
the
answer
to
your
direct
question
but
if
the
mac
superdrive
can
read
msdos
disks
can
it
then
you
can
transfer
files
between
the
next
and
a
mac
by
using
msdos
formatted
disks
since
the
next
can
readwrite
that
format
and
if
youre
interested
in
transferring
files
you
can
also
do
it
over
the
serial
port
using
kermit
cheers
