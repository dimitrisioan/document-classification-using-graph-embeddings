hi
i
am
working
on
a
project
for
my
marketing
class
and
id
like
to
ask
your
help
the
assignment
is
to
come
up
with
a
product
and
create
a
marketing
plan
for
it
technical
issues
are
not
terribly
important
at
this
point
well
my
groups
plan
is
to
market
a
full
page
monitor
for
laptop
computers
it
would
be
a
thirdparty
product
to
be
installed
by
authorized
repair
centers
like
newer
technologys
palettebook
screen
the
idea
is
that
the
screen
would
fold
in
such
a
way
that
you
would
get
twice
the
screen
height
of
a
normal
screen
remember
technical
issues
aside
in
fact
by
adjusting
the
fold
of
the
screen
and
the
monitor
configuration
you
could
have
regular
or
full
height
the
screen
would
probably
be
monochrome
the
motivation
behind
this
is
that
laptop
computers
seem
to
be
very
popular
among
business
people
business
people
also
commonly
use
word
processing
and
spreadsheet
applications
for
which
it
is
very
convenient
to
see
a
large
portion
of
the
document
because
of
the
target
users
and
applications
color
screens
arent
really
a
neccessity
we
could
hopefully
keep
the
cost
between
and
now
please
dont
write
this
off
as
completely
ridiculous
i
really
need
some
constructive
feedback
so
if
you
would
please
reply
to
me
via
email
and
let
me
know
if
you
would
consider
buying
a
full
page
laptop
screen
how
much
you
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
it
any
helpful
commentaries
on
the
idea
also
if
you
take
this
idea
and
make
a
lot
of
money
off
it
doubtful
but
who
knows
please
send
me
some
thanks
in
advance
mike
