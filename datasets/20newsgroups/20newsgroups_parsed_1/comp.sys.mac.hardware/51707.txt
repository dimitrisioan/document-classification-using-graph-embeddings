id
appreciate
it
greatly
if
someone
could
email
me
the
following
if
you
only
know
one
thats
fine
specs
for
the
esp
how
it
compares
to
the
pentium
specs
for
the
can
fill
a
page
book
some
highlights
are
bit
address
space
w
bit
data
width
bit
integer
registers
bit
floating
point
registers
k
copyback
capable
caches
way
set
associative
typical
clocksinteger
instruction
clocks
for
a
floating
point
multiply
interesting
aside
the
can
multiply
two
bit
floating
point
numbers
in
less
time
than
it
can
multiply
two
bit
integers
specs
for
the
with
estimated
cost
release
date
etc
more
of
the
same
but
with
multiple
instruction
dispatching
figure
about
clocks
per
instruction
typical
my
guess
but
the
motorola
guys
are
pretty
bright
it
may
be
less
im
interested
in
speeds
systems
it
can
run
windows
nt
risc
or
whatever
costs
bus
info
register
info
all
the
technical
info
call
motorola
im
not
typing
it
all
in
i
am
hoping
that
the
can
win
yet
another
battle
against
the
intel
people
im
predicting
that
both
the
x
and
x
lines
are
reaching
their
ends
new
experimental
processors
have
bit
data
pathways
and
can
schedule
up
to
out
of
instructions
each
clock
cycle
that
sort
of
trick
cant
really
be
done
with
cisc
architectures
i
finally
saw
some
details
on
the
pentium
and
was
not
greatly
impressed
theyve
finally
done
some
work
on
the
fpu
to
get
it
up
to
speed
but
otherwise
its
only
going
to
be
a
x
speedup
and
to
get
that
theyre
using
two
integer
units
larger
caches
and
a
branch
target
buffer
yes
i
know
theyre
talking
about
mhz
processors
big
whoop
designing
a
mhz
board
is
difficult
and
really
expensive
priced
ns
memory
chips
lately
