recommend
me
a
ps
printer
im
in
the
market
for
a
laser
printer
used
printers
are
fine
nonapple
printers
are
fine
but
whatever
printer
i
get
must
fit
the
following
required
features
postscript
dpi
emough
memory
to
download
fonts
the
cheaper
the
better
id
prefer
under
nice
things
anything
over
pages
per
minute
scsi
output
for
a
font
disk
smallish
footprint
dont
care
about
postscript
level
ii
networking
its
just
for
me
and
always
will
be
color
i
know
about
freedom
of
press
but
ive
also
heard
that
its
painfully
slow
i
can
tolerate
about
ppm
but
anything
slower
than
that
and
im
not
going
to
consider
the
price
savings
worth
it
id
be
curious
to
hear
peoples
experience
with
it
tho
i
also
infinitely
prefer
laser
over
ink
i
used
to
use
hp
deskjets
in
my
last
job
and
wasnt
impressed
with
the
quality
im
a
laser
bigot
and
the
first
to
admit
it
ill
be
using
the
printer
to
layout
pages
of
a
book
im
writing
the
page
will
include
multiple
fonts
ps
graphics
scanned
line
art
and
maybe
greyscale
pictures
not
sure
yet
the
quality
doesnt
need
to
be
spectacular
but
it
needs
to
be
clear
and
readable
printers
ive
been
looking
at
used
laserwriters
the
plus
the
nt
the
ntr
its
my
understanding
that
only
the
ntr
has
a
scsi
out
for
a
disk
true
personal
laserwriter
ls
and
ntr
i
have
access
to
the
apple
employee
discount
i
work
for
one
of
apples
spinoffs
so
i
can
get
these
reasonably
cheaply
ive
heard
bad
things
about
the
ls
comments
im
leaning
towards
the
personal
ntr
cause
it
has
a
nice
small
footprint
laserwriter
select
i
hear
it
doesnt
have
postscript
but
i
havent
seen
anything
for
sure
i
heard
mumbles
once
about
a
postscript
upgrade
used
hp
laserjets
ive
worked
with
the
ii
and
iip
on
another
platform
and
they
were
painfully
slow
are
they
that
bad
on
the
mac
ive
seen
ads
for
an
epson
ps
laserprinter
that
is
running
quite
cheap
any
comments
on
this
printer
i
hate
the
styling
too
many
ouput
trays
but
if
its
a
decent
printer
ill
consider
it
thanks
for
any
comments
