hi
i
own
an
lciii
and
i
recently
heard
an
interesting
rumor
i
heard
that
the
lciii
has
a
built
in
slot
for
a
powerpc
chip
is
this
true
i
heard
that
the
slot
is
not
the
same
as
the
pds
slot
is
that
true
thanks
david
mirsky
well
i
also
have
an
lc
iii
popping
the
top
revealed
one
socket
for
an
additional
vram
simm
one
socket
for
a
pin
ram
simm
one
socket
for
a
flatpack
fpu
a
processordirect
slot
pds
identical
to
the
lclc
ii
but
with
an
additional
set
of
connetions
to
one
side
for
the
full
bit
data
path
that
the
lclc
ii
lacked
thats
it
i
guess
a
board
with
a
powerpc
chip
could
be
made
that
would
fit
in
the
pds
but
thats
the
only
place
so
will
it
be
possible
to
have
a
nubus
or
pds
powerpc
upgrade
or
will
it
require
a
logic
board
swap
it
would
be
interesting
for
apple
to
come
out
with
a
nubus
powerpc
that
allowed
use
of
the
cpus
x
like
rocketshare
but
i
guess
thats
getting
a
bit
fantastic
i
was
wondering
since
macweek
reported
that
developers
were
seeded
with
powerpcs
on
a
nubus
card
also
any
word
on
machine
arrivals
or
estimated
speed
last
i
heard
the
estimates
were
around
times
the
speed
of
a
quadra
in
native
risc
mode
i
heard
an
apple
employee
mumble
something
about
the
arrival
of
powerpc
machines
at
a
much
earlier
date
that
q
but
i
doubt
its
true
finally
is
the
powerpc
developers
cd
minicourse
available
i
saw
it
advertised
in
the
developers
university
calendar
and
id
like
to
know
if
its
at
all
interesting
