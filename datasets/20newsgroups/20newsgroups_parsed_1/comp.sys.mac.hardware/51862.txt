buying
a
high
speed
veverything
modem
just
a
quick
summary
of
recent
findings
re
high
speed
modems
top
three
contenders
seem
to
be
att
paradyne
zyxel
and
us
robotics
zyxel
has
the
biggest
cult
following
and
can
be
had
for
under
but
i
ignored
it
because
i
need
something
with
mac
software
which
will
work
without
any
tweaking
the
att
dataport
earns
nearly
unanimous
praises
for
reliability
they
are
backordered
at
the
moment
probably
because
of
the
special
price
in
effect
until
may
its
fax
capabilities
are
worse
than
that
of
the
other
two
modems
warning
att
ads
say
that
the
modem
comes
with
a
mac
kit
cables
all
and
has
lifetime
warranty
this
applies
only
when
you
order
directly
from
paradyne
i
called
elektek
one
of
the
distributors
and
they
wanted
to
charge
me
for
cable
and
gave
only
year
warranty
usr
sportster
for
the
mac
is
also
highly
but
not
as
highly
recommended
its
only
from
clubmac
and
if
you
are
willing
to
roll
your
own
cable
and
dont
care
about
the
faxstf
software
you
can
get
the
generic
model
from
pc
outlets
for
all
this
assuming
that
you
dont
have
a
rich
uncle
and
cant
afford
a
motorola
codex
i
ended
up
ordering
the
dataport
well
see
how
it
works
in
two
weeks
or
so
