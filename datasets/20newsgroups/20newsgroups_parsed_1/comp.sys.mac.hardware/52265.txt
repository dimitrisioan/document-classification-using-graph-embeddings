re
the
mhz
iisi
i
have
done
several
of
these
upgrades
about
iisis
and
quadra
and
the
best
thing
to
use
would
be
some
sort
of
heat
sink
compound
if
possible
you
should
look
for
the
siliconfree
stuff
theres
a
comany
who
makes
the
stuff
called
tech
spray
their
address
is
po
box
amarillo
tx
you
should
be
wary
in
using
most
kinds
of
tape
and
definately
dont
use
duct
tape
that
stuff
is
for
ducts
when
using
the
heat
sink
glue
or
compound
only
use
enough
to
fill
the
small
space
between
the
heat
sink
and
the
