i
ask
only
two
things
i
can
think
of
although
nicad
c
batteries
should
be
completely
discharged
about
once
a
month
leadacid
batteries
shouldnt
ever
be
completely
discharged
well
maybe
once
in
a
while
is
okay
this
is
a
very
common
misconception
dealing
with
nicad
batteries
it
is
a
good
idea
to
completely
discharge
a
nicad
cell
periodically
it
is
not
a
good
idea
to
completely
discharge
a
nicad
battery
the
difference
being
that
a
cell
is
only
one
cell
nicad
puts
out
volts
like
a
rechargeable
aaa
aa
c
or
d
a
battery
is
defined
as
more
than
one
cell
volt
or
for
nicad
equivalent
due
to
differences
in
the
individual
cells
of
a
battery
complete
discharge
can
actually
harm
a
nicad
battery
more
than
help
it
overcome
the
memory
effect
the
most
common
problem
is
that
over
time
an
individual
cell
can
develop
internal
shorts
which
will
weaken
other
cells
that
are
connected
to
it
thus
reducing
the
lifespan
of
your
battery
pack
etc
okay
naive
question
how
does
one
discharge
a
cell
without
discharging
the
entire
battery
