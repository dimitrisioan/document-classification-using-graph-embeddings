i
was
hoping
someone
knowledgeable
about
mac
internals
could
set
me
straight
is
it
simply
impossible
for
a
mac
se
to
print
grayscale
or
could
someone
armed
with
enough
info
and
a
little
pro
gramming
experience
cook
something
up
that
would
supplement
the
roms
capabilities
to
use
the
grayscale
features
i
believe
you
need
a
mac
equipped
with
colour
quickdraw
i
was
told
this
somewhere
or
other
but
its
not
mentioned
in
apple
facts
guide
for
apple
sellers
in
the
press
release
or
in
the
technical
specs
sean
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
mac
se
can
print
grayscale
images
loaded
with
the
proper
software
however
the
mac
se
can
not
display
grayscale
on
its
screen
or
any
attached
video
because
that
ability
is
not
in
the
rom
so
while
you
might
be
able
to
print
grayscale
youd
have
a
hard
time
seeing
the
grayscale
image
you
want
to
print
