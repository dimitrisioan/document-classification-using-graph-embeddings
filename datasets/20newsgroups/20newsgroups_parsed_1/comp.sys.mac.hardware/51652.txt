i
posted
a
note
asking
for
specs
on
the
quadra
and
opinions
on
the
q
upgrade
of
a
iici
vs
an
accelerator
card
so
far
no
responsed
that
ive
noticed
please
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
these
possible
upgrade
paths
cost
efficiency
proscons
etc
thanks
complete
q
are
best
obtained
from
your
dealer
or
some
recent
copy
of
macworld
or
macuser
my
foggy
memory
suggests
that
the
most
relevant
comparison
factors
visavis
a
iici
are
as
follows
mhz
mhz
data
path
dont
recall
this
for
sure
but
its
slower
than
q
style
machines
for
sure
ethertalk
card
onboard
audio
inout
mb
ram
on
motherboard
simm
slots
nubus
slots
more
flexible
buildin
video
than
the
ci
uses
vram
in
comparison
a
iici
with
an
accelerator
wont
give
you
audio
or
ethernet
or
the
same
video
options
with
a
accelerator
cpu
performance
can
be
comparable
but
i
think
it
ends
up
costing
more
greg
dudek
actually
an
accelerator
such
as
the
daystar
mhz
is
cheaper
than
upgrading
to
a
q
mhz
the
accelerator
costs
about
whereas
the
upgrade
costs
just
quoted
from
my
dealer
however
the
q
upgrade
gives
you
very
fast
built
in
video
that
supports
monitors
up
to
with
bit
depth
and
up
to
at
bit
depth
with
additional
vram
it
also
has
a
scsi
port
capable
of
a
much
faster
throughput
than
the
ci
which
makes
a
big
difference
if
you
have
a
fast
hard
drive
if
the
improved
video
and
scsi
features
are
important
to
you
youre
better
off
getting
the
q
upgrade
otherwise
save
some
money
and
get
an
accelerator
