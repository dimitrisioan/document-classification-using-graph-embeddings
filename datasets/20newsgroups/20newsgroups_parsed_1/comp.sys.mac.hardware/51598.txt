problems
attention
mac
quadra
owners
many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded
that
mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
an
example
would
be
a
sony
inch
mo
without
the
special
maccompatible
firmware
installed
one
solution
sometimes
is
to
disable
blind
writes
this
doesnt
sound
right
to
me
dont
quadras
use
the
c
if
so
the
mac
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
scsi
timing
thats
all
handled
by
the
chip
about
the
only
the
timing
could
be
wrong
is
if
apple
programs
the
clock
registers
wrong
on
the
that
however
should
only
really
hurt
synchronous
transfer
which
is
not
used
by
the
mac
scsi
manager
furthermore
disabling
blind
writes
should
be
meaningless
on
a
quadra
on
macs
that
used
the
which
is
a
much
lower
level
scsi
chip
the
mac
was
responsible
for
the
handshake
of
each
byte
transferred
blind
mode
affected
how
the
mac
handled
that
handshake
on
the
the
handshake
is
entirely
handled
by
the
chip
