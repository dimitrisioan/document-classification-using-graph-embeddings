hi
i
have
a
question
which
is
the
diference
between
performa
and
lciii
i
want
to
know
which
is
better
if
you
know
the
specifications
and
the
prices
of
this
computers
can
you
tell
me
by
email
to
id
like
to
know
the
diference
between
the
apple
monitor
and
the
performa
monitor
too

performa
well
nothing
the
performas
are
made
to
be
lowcost
business
solutions
the
xx
have
bundled
software
modems
etc
because
they
have
no
retail
price
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
steeper
discount
on
them
shop
around
as
far
as
the
monitors
go
buy
rd
party
much
cheaper
brett
theres
nothing
so
passionate
as
a
vested
interest
disguised
as
an
intellectual
conviction

hmmm
thats
not
quite
right
the
performa
is
real
darn
close
to
the
iivx
but
a
better
buy
imo
i
also
dont
think
they
are
so
much
a
lowcost
business
solution
but
a
lowcost
home
solution
why
else
bundle
at
ease
among
other
things
hardly
a
business
application
what
do
you
mean
by
no
retail
price
quite
the
contrary
i
think
the
price
is
darn
near
the
same
all
across
the
country
that
again
imo
was
one
of
the
selling
points
of
the
performas
ie
no
haggling
required
kinda
like
the
saturn
car
of
the
computer
set
one
price
medium
performance
ready
to
go
when
i
shopped
for
my
performa
cd
the
difference
between
sears
sigh
montgomery
wards
silo
sigh
circuit
city
sigh
and
bizmart
sigh
couldnt
have
been
why
i
chose
one
over
the
other
was
based
solely
on
availability
and
a
friendly
salesman
who
went
the
extra
mile
when
did
you
last
hear
that
about
someone
who
sells
apples
admittedly
except
for
montgomery
wards
and
i
suspect
i
was
just
lucky
all
of
the
salesfolk
i
spoke
to
didnt
know
didly
about
the
computers
peecee
or
mac
but
then
neither
did
any
of
the
apple
dealers
i
spoke
with
if
you
wouldve
told
me
a
year
ago
that
i
would
buy
a
macintosh
from
montgomery
wards
i
woulda
laughed
for
a
long
long
time
go
figure
im
real
happy
with
my
performa
oh
and
i
bought
the
apple
performa
plus
monitor
vs
buying
rd
party
happy
with
that
decision
as
well
i
walked
in
plopped
down
some
cash
and
walked
out
with
a
spankin
new
computer
the
day
before
christmas
instrument
