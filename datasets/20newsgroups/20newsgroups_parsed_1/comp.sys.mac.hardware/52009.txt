wierdness
ive
been
getting
seemingly
random
disk
accesses
on
my
centris
with
a
quantum
lps
but
this
is
not
the
regular
recalibration
it
has
been
doing
since
i
got
it
this
is
sometimes
short
sometimes
long
accesses
that
sound
like
there
is
some
readwriting
going
on
i
have
sam
and
disinfectant
but
neither
picks
up
anything
any
ideas
