what
is
the
difference
i
want
a
doublespin
cdrom
drive
by
may
looking
into
nec
and
apple
doublespins
only
what
is
the
best
nec
toshiba
and
sony
apple
nearly
deliver
the
same
speed
as
apples
prices
are
very
low
compared
to
there
ram
simms
you
should
buy
what
is
inexpencive
but
think
of
driver
revisions
it
is
easier
to
get
driver
kits
from
apple
than
from
every
other
manufacturer
christian

i
thought
nec
and
toshiba
cdrom
mechanism
have
an
average
access
time
of
less
than
ms
while
the
sonyapple
cdrom
drive
has
an
access
time
of
ms
for
the
doublespin
models

i
have
the
a
cdtechnology
drive
with
the
toshiba
mechanism
and
it
is
supposedly
the
fast
and
best
now
it
has
an
access
of
ms
and
a
data
transfer
rate
kbsec
it
is
multisession
photocd
compatible
it
is
available
from
educorp
for
the
cdtechnology
one
and
comes
with
two
mail
in
coupons
for
two
free
cds
im
not
sure
if
the
cds
are
good
since
ive
only
had
the
drive
a
little
less
than
a
month
and
had
the
cds
shipped
to
my
home
address
in
california
instead
of
here
in
maryland
the
cdtechnology
drive
has
a
separate
power
supply
separated
from
the
drive
which
supposedly
gives
it
a
longer
life
and
keeps
it
cleaner
with
no
fan
to
attract
dust
a
toshiba
brand
drive
is
also
available
but
i
think
the
cdtechnology
is
better
since
you
get
the
same
mechanism
and
at
a
slightly
lower
price
with
two
free
cds
the
apple
i
drive
sony
mechanism
is
around
a
ms
access
time
i
think
and
a
data
transfer
rate
of
kbsec
i
know
it
is
the
slowest
of
the
three
mentioned
here
it
is
not
widely
available
except
through
the
apple
catalog
which
is
bad
at
a
price
of
only
it
is
also
multisession
photo
cd
compatible
i
think
the
external
model
comes
with
free
cds
some
of
which
are
pretty
good
the
nec
drive
has
been
out
the
longest
it
has
an
access
time
of
ms
and
a
data
transfer
rate
of
kbsec
it
is
available
from
many
vendors
around
dollars
including
educorp
it
wasnt
multisesssion
photocd
compatible
before
but
i
hear
that
the
current
version
that
is
shipping
is
owners
of
the
older
drives
can
get
an
upgrade
it
does
not
come
with
any
free
cds
unless
you
buy
it
in
a
bundle
of
the
three
cdrom
drives
above
i
think
the
best
choices
would
be
the
apple
drive
and
the
cdtechnologytoshiba
drive
the
apple
drive
for
its
compatibility
with
apple
products
and
the
cdtechnologytoshiba
for
its
speed
and
performance
btw
the
models
of
the
drives
are
apple
applecd
or
applecd
i
internal
cdtechnology
cdt
the
toshiba
brand
name
model
im
not
sure
but
it
is
also
something
like
with
nec
cdr
im
very
happy
with
my
drive
and
have
had
no
compatibility
problems
whatsoever
if
i
am
wrong
about
any
of
the
above
do
correct
me
but
i
am
pretty
sure
of
myself
even
when
i
think
im
not
also
some
of
you
out
there
might
notice
that
i
have
the
same
last
name
as
the
president
of
cdtechnology
which
happens
to
be
in
southern
california
my
hometown
however
i
am
not
a
relative
nor
do
i
know
the
guy
liu
is
just
a
common
chinese
name
especially
in
southern
california
with
the
enormous
chinese
community
besides
one
of
my
doctors
in
california
has
three
steve
lius
as
patients
and
another
steve
liu
comes
to
my
school
and
lives
in
the
next
dorm
this
is
to
show
that
liu
is
very
common
steve
steve
liu
i
wish
for
a
better
sig
suggestions
are
very
welcome
