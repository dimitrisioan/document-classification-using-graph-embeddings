echo
mail
from
around
the
world
ok
if
i
post
where
this
comes
from
will
people
stop
sending
email
asking
where
i
negotiated
the
deal
the
deal
is
from
international
computer
and
networking
in
ca
i
saw
the
ad
int
he
back
of
macworld
and
macuser
phone
number
is
and
the
deal
may
have
changed
since
a
few
weeks
ago
since
they
change
prices
about
every
ten
minutes
alas
this
is
a
funny
system
it
sounds
like
a
good
deal
but
this
is
a
centris

the
motherboard
mb
simm
mb
hd
no
ethernet
and
no
coprocessor
well
actually
its
a
lc
instead
of
a
rc
just
had
to
say
that
to
keep
people
from
saying
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
without
a
coprocessor
since
the
fpu
is
built
into
the
chip
ok
there
ya
have
it
but
if
i
were
you

would
wait
untill
