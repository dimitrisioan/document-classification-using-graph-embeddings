re
lciii
problems
finally
got
my
computer
fixed
and
id
like
to
sum
up
about
hard
drive
companies
the
original
meg
drive
that
was
bad
bad
sector
or
something
was
an
ibm
the
new
one
is
a
quantum
is
the
lciii
supposed
to
be
shipped
with
ibms
is
there
a
quality
difference
apparently
second
about
hard
drive
position
ive
put
the
lciii
on
its
side
and
the
new
hd
has
had
no
problems
at
all
ive
even
switched
back
and
forth
between
horizontal
and
vertical
and
there
are
no
problems
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
dont
believe
hd
position
is
important
for
drives
up
to
meg
in
any
computer
dont
know
about
cdrom
though
just
like
everything
else
in
life
the
right
lane
ends
in
half
a
mile
