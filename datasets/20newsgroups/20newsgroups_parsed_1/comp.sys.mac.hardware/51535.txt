i
guess
this
changes
my
opinion
of
them
and
i
thought
i
would
warn
any
prospective
customers
for
the
ensc
pb
fwiw
i
work
for
focus
enhancements
and
a
lot
of
the
people
we
sell
our
etherlan
scsct
our
scsi
ethernet
interface
are
disgruntled
ensc
users
i
also
now
need
to
know
if
anyone
has
been
successful
with
the
comparable
product
from
dayna
or
focus
i
really
dont
want
to
use
up
that
nubus
slot
sigh
i
wish
i
had
better
news
the
focus
etherlan
sc
is
currently
incompatible
with
the
duos
this
may
change
in
the
future
we
do
have
apple
register
compatible
cards
that
are
compatible
with
the
duodocks
though
send
questions
to
peter
a
cohen
id
rather
be
telecommuting
