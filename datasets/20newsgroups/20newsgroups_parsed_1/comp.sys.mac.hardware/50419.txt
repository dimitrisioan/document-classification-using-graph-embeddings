subject
re
your
opinion
of
the
laserwriter
select
my
wife
has
one
of
these
i
have
not
had
much
chance
to
fiddle
with
it
but
in
comparison
to
our
laserwriters
with
canon
engines
she
complains
that
the
print
is
too
light
for
her
taste
the
difference
is
quite
apparent
even
when
the
print
setting
on
the
select
is
adjusted
to
the
darkest
possible
level
i
dont
find
it
objectionable
and
indeed
rather
like
it
but
be
warned
that
some
people
dont
care
for
it
and
it
is
considerably
different
i
recall
that
years
ago
there
were
lots
of
debates
over
writeblack
vs
writewhite
engines
when
dealing
with
tex
drivers
is
something
like
that
going
on
here
