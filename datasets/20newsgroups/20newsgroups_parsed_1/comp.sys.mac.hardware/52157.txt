hello
i
saw
this
question
posted
a
week
or
so
ago
but
as
far
as
i
could
tell
no
answer
appeared
on
the
net
what
is
the
good
oil
on
connecting
the
apple
extended
keyboard
to
a
powerbook
the
earlier
questioner
wonderd
if
this
would
any
help
gratefully
recieved
i
will
summarise
to
the
net
if
necessary
the
general
consensus
seems
to
be
that
an
extended
keyboard
or
the
new
ergonomic
keyboard
with
mouse
is
ok
the
pb
is
rated
for
ma
which
is
apparently
identical
to
the
lc
and
the
lc
works
fine
with
said
attachments
thanks
very
much
to
those
who
repliedi
am
now
on
my
way
to
order
a
battleship
and
a
mouse
john
now
i
wonder
about
my
electric
toothbrush
ps
i
am
thinking
of
a
pb
but
i
assume
that
this
would
apply
to
all
pbs
