the
att
dataport
earns
nearly
unanimous
praises
for
reliability
they
are
backordered
at
the
moment
probably
because
of
the
special
price
in
effect
until
may
its
fax
capabilities
are
worse
than
that
of
the
other
two
modems
warning
att
ads
say
that
the
modem
comes
with
a
mac
kit
cables
all
and
has
lifetime
warranty
this
applies
only
when
you
order

from
paradyne
i
called
elektek
one
of
the
distributors
and
they
wanted
to
charge
me

and
gave
only
year
warranty

this
information
concerning
the
cable
and
