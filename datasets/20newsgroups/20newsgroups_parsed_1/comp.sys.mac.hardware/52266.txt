sad
mac
code
f
i
believe
that
that
would
be
the
same
as
a
system
error
since
there
is
no
error
then
i
would
guess
that
it
would
be
a
error
which
is
a
font
manager
error
of
error
during
font
declairation
i
would
assume
that
the
system
thats
on
the
floppy
that
you
are
trying
start
up
on
has
a
corrupted
font
in
it
or
something
like
that
