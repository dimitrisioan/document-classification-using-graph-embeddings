hi
i
think
i
have
a
problem
with
the
stereo
sound
output
on
my
quadra
but
i
am
not
totally
sure
because
my
roomate
has
the
same
problem
on
his
powerbook
any
info
or
experience
anyopne
has
would
be
greatly
appreciated
when
i
hook
my
quadra
up
to
my
home
stereo
system
the
following
types
of
sounds
mono
as
far
as
i
can
tell
all
play
fine
through
both
speakers
system
beeps
already
provided
ones
such
as
indigo
and
ones
i
record
armor
alley
spectre
spaceward
ho
but
the
following
games
only
play
out
of
the
left
channel
lemmings
out
of
this
world
awesome
game
btw
glider
oids
but
still
stereo
system
beeps
do
play
in
stereo
through
both
speakers
the
one
im
specifically
referrring
to
is
apocolyptic
beginning
which
my
roommate
downloaded
from
some
ftp
site
sumex
all
of
the
symptoms
are
the
same
on
my
rommates
he
cant
run
ootw
because
he
doesnt
have
color
were
both
running
system
does
anyone
with
lemmings
or
the
other
three
games
i
mentioned
above
get
sound
out
of
both
speakers
on
a
mac
ii
class
quadra
lc
powerbook
or
greater
centris
se
etc
stereo
machine
i
used
to
have
a
mac
ii
and
i
sort
of
rememeber
lemmings
playing
in
stereo
on
that
machine
not
just
on
the
left
channel
i
could
be
mistaken
though
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
quad
s
and
pb
s
i
am
wondering
why
the
system
beeps
still
play
in
stereo
if
there
isnt
a
problem
with
our
machines
i
wonder
why
the
games
above
are
apparantly
written
to
support
only
one
channel
of
stereo
when
they
could
just
use
mono
sounds
so
the
mono
sound
would
at
least
come
out
of
both
speakers
like
spectre
etc
do
quadra
s
and
powerbook
s
have
the
same
roms
to
my
knowledge
so
maybe
this
is
a
rom
problem
if
so
though
why
wouldnt
system
patch
over
this
problem
thanks
for
any
help
you
can
provide
in

mac
sound
hardware
is
diverse
some
macs
play
in
stereo
and
mix
the
output
the
se
for
instance
while
others
play
in
stereo
but
only
has
the
left
channel
for
the
speaker
while
some
are
truly
mono
like
the
lc
developers
know
that
stuff
played
in
the
left
channel
is
guaranteed
to
be
heard
while
the
right
channel
isnt
some
send
data
to
both
some
only
send
data
to
the
left
channel
the
first
is
preferrable
of
course
okay
i
guess
its
time
for
a
quick
explanation
of
mac
sound
the
original
documentation
for
the
sound
hardware
im
documents
how
to
make
sound
by
directly
accessing
hardware
basically
you
jam
values
into
all
the
even
bytes
from
soundbase
to
soundbasex
this
was
because
of
how
the
mac
and
some
later
machines
generated
sound
was
by
scanning
this
block
and
daing
every
even
byte
the
odd
bytes
went
to
the
floppy
on
some
machines
when
the
mac
ii
and
apple
sound
chip
was
invented
it
was
designed
to
generate
stereo
sound
it
was
also
designed
to
be
compatible
with
we
had
once
documented
so
storing
bytes
at
the
even
values
at
soundbase
meant
i
want
to
play
a
mono
sound
and
so
it
was
emulated
but
apple
had
since
retracted
the
documentation
on
soundbase
and
decided
not
to
document
the
lowest
layers
of
sound
generation
so
apple
never
explained
where
to
stuff
bytes
if
you
want
to
make
stereo
sound
enter
game
developers
the
sound
driver
and
current
sound
manager
are
inconveniently
lame
for
making
games
furthermore
people
who
port
from
the
ibm
dont
want
to
learn
more
apis
so
it
has
become
popular
for
game
writers
to
write
to
soundbase
to
make
sound
since
it
is
very
easy
since
the
mac
ii
apple
has
had
many
different
kind
of
sound
output
hardware
and
the
only
things
they
have
in
common
are
that
writing
to
soundbase
works
on
some
hardware
mac
ii
iix
iicx
iici
at
least
writing
to
soundbase
gets
you
mono
sound
through
both
speakers
on
some
macs
quadra
at
least
writing
to
soundbase
gets
you
mono
sound
on
the
left
channel
only
both
are
technically
correct
interpretations
of
the
original
specification
but
one
is
obviously
preferable
for
asthetic
reasons
if
developers
use
the
sound
manager
and
i
think
the
sound
driver
mono
sounds
will
typically
come
out
through
both
channels
regardless
of
the
underlying
hardware
it
is
possible
to
specify
you
want
to
generate
left
channel
only
but
no
one
does
if
developers
write
to
sound
base
their
games
will
only
come
out
the
left
on
some
games
the
other
problem
the
original
mac
ii
only
producing
left
channel
sound
on
the
internal
speaker
while
the
se
mixes
both
isnt
really
related
it
is
due
to
the
post
generation
amplification
used
on
the
motherboards
of
the
different
machines
it
only
affects
true
stereo
sounds
sounds
which
are
actually
mono
will
play
on
the
internal
speaker
no
matter
what
machine
you
have
now
to
more
directly
address
the
question
the
games
you
list
lemmings
out
of
this
world
awesome
game
btw
glider
oids
and
also
hellcats
super
tetris
oxyd
and
many
more
these
are
just
what
ive
tested
cheat
and
write
to
soundbase
and
so
are
only
left
channel
on
quadras
other
games
you
list
armor
alley
spectre
spaceward
ho
and
also
pga
tour
golf
civilization
and
more
these
are
again
only
from
personal
experience
use
the
sound
manager
and
work
fine
on
all
machines
the
more
of
the
story
is
to
developers
dont
cheat
really
i
am
absolutely
positively
not
allowed
to
do
what
i
am
about
to
do
but
im
going
say
it
anyway
stop
cheating
on
sound
really
soon
you
will
be
sorry
as
even
those
without
external
speakers
will
be
disappointed
with
your
sound
on
future
hardware
the
grace
period
is
about
to
end
the
sound
manager
is
understandable
now
and
works
pretty
well
and
will
work
even
better
soon
so
use
it
in
conclusion
to
doug
it
isnt
a
hardware
problem
at
least
not
a
bug
to
jon
it
isnt
a
choice
to
developers
as
to
whether
they
want
to
send
sound
to
both
channels
if
they
do
it
the
right
way
it
is
taken
care
of
automatically
if
you
cheat
there
is
not
way
to
make
it
work
on
all
hardware
have
fun
disclaimer
number
i
dont
work
on
sound
here
at
apple
im
just
pretty
well
informed
so
dont
write
me
with
sound
questions
disclaimer
number
if
it
says
up
above
that
i
wrote
anything
like
the
grace
period
is
about
to
end
then
it
is
a
bug
in
your
news
feed
since
i
am
catagorically
not
allowed
to
say
anything
like
that
you
know
what
i
mean
disclaimer
number
i
dont
speak
for
apple
just
me
