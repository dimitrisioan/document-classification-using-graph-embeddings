has
anyone
heard
of
a
scsi
device
that
can
capture
video
we
need
some
sort
of
device
that
can
capture
about
frames
or
so
per
second
and
work
off
the
scsi
bus
the
idea
is
to
use
it
for
some
sort
of
video
conferencing
application
if
i
told
you
all
that
went
down
it
would
burn
off
both
your
ears
these
thoughts
are
only
my
own
