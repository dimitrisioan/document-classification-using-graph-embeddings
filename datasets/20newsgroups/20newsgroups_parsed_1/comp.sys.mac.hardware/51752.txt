not

but
the
interesting
comparision
is
how
fast
clockcycle
chips
you
can
get
an
alpha
is
way
slow
at
mhz
but
blazes
at
mhz
as
far
as
the

goes
specint
specfp
but
the
is

will
soon
be
available
in
mhz
version
making
it
comparable
to
a
dx
intel
chips
have
traditionally
been
faster
than
their
motorola
equivalents
although
the
significance
of
chip
speed
in
real
world
application
performance
is
something
that
is
highly
debatable
i
think
you
have
that
one
turned
around
they
have
faster
clock
cycles
but
less
power
behind
each
cycle
not
to
mention
that
the
intel
instruction
stream
is
byteoriented
longest
intel
instruction
is
bytes
what
an
odd
number
which
makes
it
hard
to
do
any
intelligent
memory
subsystem
