multiple

clashing

ive
had
a
couple
of
email
responses
from
people
who
seem
to
believe
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
only
unsupported
it
is
downright
dangerous

have
heard
of
no
such
warnings
from
anybody
at
apple

to
be
sure

asked
a
couple
of
our
technicians

of
whom
has
been
servicing
macs
for
years

unplugging
adb
devices

the
power
on
