re
desktop
rebuild
and
datadesk
keyboard
my
datadesk
mac
e
keyboard
has
similar
problems
i
have
found
that
holding
down
the
righthand
shift
key
at
startup
will
work
disable
extensions
but
the
lefthand
shift
key
wont
which
is
unfortunate
since
the
left
one
is
the
one
i
instinctively
reach
for
similarly
i
have
trained
myself
to
hold
down
the
righthand
pair
of
commandoption
for
desktop
rebuilds
i
is
irritating
