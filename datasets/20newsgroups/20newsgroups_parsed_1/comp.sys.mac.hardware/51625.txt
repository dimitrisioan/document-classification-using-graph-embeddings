the
partition
button
in
apples
hd
setup
lets
you
set
up
aux
and
other
types
of
partitions
it
wont
let
you
create
more
than
one
normal
mac
volume
you
need
silverlining
or
something
similar
to
do
that
it
will
however
allow
you
to
take
advantage
of
some
possible
unused
space
on
your
hard
disk
if
you
dont
mind
reformatting
the
whole
thing
