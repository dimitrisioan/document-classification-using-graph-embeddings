asante
ensc
hangs
scsi
devices
i
just
hooked
up
my
mac
iisi
to
a
relatively
old
year
asante
ensc
adapter
the
baset
connection
works
like
a
charm
i
installed
the
newest
drivers
from
asantes
ftp
server
the
problem
begins
when
i
attach
one
more
device
to
the
scsi
chain
specifically
a
mb
drive
i
power
up
the
drive
then
the
mac
the
mac
tests
memory
etc
just
before
the
happy
mac
face
normally
shows
up
the
power
light
on
the
ensc
goes
out
and
the
boot
process
stops
so
i
can
use
the
network
or
the
external
drive
but
not
both
at
once
this
makes
the
asante
box
pretty
much
unusable
it
doesnt
look
like
a
purely
electrical
scsi
problem
because
if
i
turn
on
the
drive
just
a
second
or
so
too
late
so
that
it
doesnt
get
noticed
during
the
initial
scsi
polling
the
mac
boots
normally
and
the
adapter
works
even
though
the
hard
disk
is
powered
on
and
connected
the
mac
has
never
once
failed
to
boot
from
its
internal
drive
up
to
now
and
ive
had
it
for
over
a
year
here
is
what
i
tried
changing
the
scsi
ids
of
the
ensc
and
the
disk
several
permutations
changing
the
order
of
devices
ie
the
ensc
at
the
head
or
tail
of
the
chain
overterminating
with
an
external
terminator
both
devices
have
internal
ones
underterminating
ie
removing
internal
resistors
from
the
hard
disk
trying
another
ensc
box
trying
another
identical
drive
trying
several
different
scsi
cables
has
anybody
seen
this
more
importantly
does
anyone
have
a
solution
thanks
a
lot
