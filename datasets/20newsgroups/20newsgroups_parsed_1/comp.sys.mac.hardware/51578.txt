anyone

some
more
money

be
able
to
haul
it
around
would
probably
plan
to
get
an
mo
drive
or
something
so
i
dont
have
to
depend
on
an
internal
fixed
hard
drive
ie

be
pretty
rough
on
an
internal
hd
im
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
if
that
matters
also
anyone
have
any
info
on
s
and
midi
and
would
anyone
care
to
email
me
with
the
price
they
paid
for
their
or
if
theres
a
price
list
faq
never
mind
just
curious
about
the
difference
between
the
best
retailers
and
the
local
university
pricing
