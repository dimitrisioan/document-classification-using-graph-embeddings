indicated
that
david
ramseys
mac
iix
has
been
running
nicely
with
a
mac
iici
rom
in
it
offering
clean
bit
rom
code
liberating
his
iix
from
the
virtual
memory
nightmare
caused
by
apples
bit
system
enabler
this
would
make
me
a
bit
suspect
of
mr
ramseys
qualifications
as
a
selfstyled
expert
in
fact
when
i
read
about
anybody
using
virtual
memory
regularly
i
kind
of
wonder
yes
one
can
sometimes
get
away
with
running
a
newer
rom
of
the
correct
size
obviously
in
an
older
machine
but
one
should
be
prepared
for
problems
if
running
software
that
checks
for
machine
type
rather
than
rom
trap
availability
and
then
draws
incorrect
conclusions
when
specialcasing
especially
timingdependent
and
driverrelated
stuff
in
this
particular
case
i
see
no
reason
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
romswapping
the
apple
bit
enabler
has
problems
but
mode
works
just
fine
with
and
does
anyone
know
of
a
source
for
these
roms
sure
buy
a
used
iici
motherboard
call
preowned
electronics
shreve
or
other
parts
dealers
see
the
back
of
computer
shopper
or
one
of
the
mac
trades
for
phone
numbers
and
ask
for
a
price
on
a
iici
rom
everything
has
a
price
if
you
happen
to
find
somebody
who
salvaged
a
iici
with
a
dead
motherboard
you
might
get
a
decent
price
there
is
probably
a
market
for
used
mother
boards
as
well
so
they
might
sell
a
rom
anyway
needless
to
say
im
interested
in
purchasing
such
a
rom
what
would
be
a
reasonably
price
to
offer
ask
for
a
quote
and
then
try
offering
less
preowned
and
shreve
have
been
known
to
dicker
their
ads
in
various
trade
magazines
often
list
considerably
different
prices
for
the
same
items
and
their
phone
quotes
tend
to
vary
as
well
still
im
not
aware
of
any
technical
reason
for
upgrading
the
rom
in
a
