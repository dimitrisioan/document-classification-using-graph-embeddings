system
on
a
macintosh
iifx
can
not
run
multifinder
beeps
my
friend
has
a
macintosh
iifx
on
which
he
is
running
system
not
enough
memory
yet
to
run
sys
adequately
and
he
noticed
that
when
he
tries
to
use
multifinder
on
this
machine
the
machine
will
beep
every
few
seconds
incessantly
nonstop
now
this
friend
has
a
tendency
to
install
things
on
his
machine
rather
haphazardly
but
he
did
rebuild
his
system
from
scratch
and
it
still
occurs
does
this
problem
sound
familiar
at
all
to
anyone
for
all
i
know
the
problem
is
caused
by
something
really
obscure
but
if
this
is
a
known
simple
thing
yeah
right
that
someone
is
familiar
with
like
system
multifinder
doesnt
run
on
a
mac
iifx
or
if
someone
here
knows
what
he
should
be
looking
for
please
send
email
either
to
me
or
to
him

advance
