good
aps
experience
i
just
thought
i
would
pass
along
my
experience
with
aps
i
recently
ordered
an
external
quantum
the
salesperson
was
friendly
and
knowledgeable
the
order
came
when
promised
and
the
invoice
was
at
the
price
quoted
installing
the
drive
was
simple
i
didnt
even
have
to
read
the
manual
the
scsi
address
is
set
by
a
pushbutton
arrangement
i
daisychained
the
drive
from
my
syquest
also
from
aps
and
booted
up
with
no
problems
im
still
going
through
all
the
shareware
that
comes
on
the
drive
its
a
pretty
good
assortment
the
drivefan
is
a
bit
noisier
than
i
would
like
but
i
think
itll
be
ok
the
speed
seems
very
good
although
i
havent
run
any
objective
tests
it
also
seems
to
spin
up
pretty
quickly
i
can
hit
the
power
switch
for
it
and
almost
immediately
power
the
mac
without
any
problems
booting
from
the
drive
some
observations
the
case
is
plastic
good
quality
though
while
my
older
syquest
case
is
metal
there
is
one
led
which
is
normally
green
and
flickers
red
as
the
drive
is
accessed
just
a
data
point
