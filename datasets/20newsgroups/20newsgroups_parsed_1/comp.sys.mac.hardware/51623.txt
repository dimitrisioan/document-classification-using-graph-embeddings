hi
i
own
an
lciii
and
i
recently
heard
an
interesting
rumor
i
heard
that
the
lciii
has
a
built
in
slot
for
a
powerpc
chip
is
this
true
i
heard
that
the
slot
is
not
the
same
as
the
pds
slot
is
that
true
thanks
david
mirsky
well
i
also
have
an
lc
iii
popping
the
top
revealed
one
socket
for
an
additional
vram
simm
one
socket
for
a
pin
ram
simm
one
socket
for
a
flatpack
fpu
a
processordirect
slot
pds
identical
to
the
lclc
ii
but
with
an
additional
set
of
connetions
to
one
side
for
the
full
bit
data
path
that
the
lclc
ii
lacked
thats
it
i
guess
a
board
with
a
powerpc
chip
could
be
made
that
would
fit
in
the
pds
but
thats
the
only
place
