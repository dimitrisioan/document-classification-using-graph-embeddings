i
ordered
an
external
floppy
drive
from
them
years
ago
when
i
placed
the
order
they
said
it
was
in
stock
and
would
ship
the
next
day
a
week
passed
and
no
drive
i
called
them
up
and
they
said
they
were
out
of
stock
and
my
drive
should
ship
in
weeks
or
so
since
i
needed
the
drive
right
away
both
my
internal
hard
drive
and
floppy
were
dead
i
cancelled
my
order
and
havent
dealt
with
them
since
chris
kidwell
i
too
had
a
very
unpleasant
experience
with
hardware
thats
shi
it
featured
repeated
lies
about
when
things
had
shipped
a
salesperson
who
was
totally
ignorant
about
what
he
was
selling
a
charge
for
duties
i
had
specifically
been
assured
were
not
payable
and
then
a
monitor
their
house
brand
page
monochrome
that
was
the
most
unadulterated
piece
of
junk
it
has
ever
been
my
misfortune
to
experience
in
the
world
of
electronics
i
shipped
it
back
and
they
refunded
my
money
but
it
still
cost
me
something
over
for
long
distance
charges
nonrefundable
taxes
and
duties
and
lost
time
dont
deal
with
them
