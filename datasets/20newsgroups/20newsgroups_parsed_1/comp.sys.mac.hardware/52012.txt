that
was
my
point
sony
did
manufacture
the
powerbook
under
license
from
apple
and
it
actually
works
yup
i
bought
the
darn
thing
cause
it
was
sturdy
i
carry
it
around
in
an
unpadded
unless
you
consider
all
the
papers
and
files
and
folders
bookbag
shoulder
strap
little
job
from
eddie
bauer
ive
travelled
cross
country
several
times
with
walkman
discman
and
tapes
books
and
computer
all
piled
in
their
my
pb
works
happily
and
im
typing
on
it
right
now
it
has
a
global
village
teleport
v
internal
sendreceive
faxmodem
and
i
just
love
it
unfortunately
i
have
seen
a
new
duo
that
a
friend
bought
as
a
primary
computer
i
have
a
mac
iisi
and
se
as
primary
home
computers
and
quadra
and
iici
at
work
in
the
lab
and
while
amazed
at
the
lightness
of
it
i
was
kinda
shocked
at
the
flimsiness
of
the
screen
im
sure
itd
break
real
easy
sorry
but
other
than
my
trinitron
everything
else
ive
ever
bought
from
sony
has
failed
why
did
i
keep
trying
because
im
tupid
aw
cmon
ive
got
a
sony
vcr
a
sony
tv
both
must
be
over
two
years
old
by
now
a
sony
camcorder
five
months
old
and
of
course
an
apple
rgb
monitor
with
a
sony
tube
that
im
never
going
to
part
with
and
the
cdi
drive
in
my
monthold
centris
is
in
fact
a
sony
maybe
its
a
question
of
personal
compatibility
maybe
your
body
puts
out
the
wrong
polarity
of
static
electricity
or
something
geez
we
are
a
sony
familly
our
neighbor
works
for
zeinth

guy
nevertheless
we
still
have
two
working
sony
color
trinitrons
from
and
older
one
is
on
its
second
picture
tube
but
both
work
now
theyre
relegated
to
the
old
bit
atari
computer
and
atari
game
machinces
as
well
as
our
notthatold
younger
sisters
nintendo
game
machine
sony
doesnt
make
tvs
like
they
used
to
though
the
newer
mexican
assemblyline
tvs
are
not
that
reliable
or
sharp
anymore

got
a
directview
sony
god
the
thing
weighs
a
ton
still
where

cd
players
or
