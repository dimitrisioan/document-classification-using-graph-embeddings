macintosh
lab
help
interesting
delema
for
all
those
out
there
my
school
is
discussing
installing
a
mac
lab
of
to
stations
for
our
bio
to
classes
to
do
a
study
with
pig
disections
no
joke
here
is
the
deal
we
can
get
this
grant
to
do
a
study
on
if
it
is
more
feasible
to
do
a
disection
via
the
computer
or
via
the
real
thing
my
problem
is
i
was
somehow
drawn
into
this
project
being
done
by
students
who
want
to
go
mac
but
know
nada
about
them
being
the
man
mac
man
on
campus
guess
who
they
came
to
so
i
wnt
to
know
what
would
probably
be
the
best
hardware
to
fill
the
follwoing
list
right
now
we
are
looking
at
the
c
and
the
vx
platforms
ok
here
it
goes
we
are
using
cdrom
so
ought
we
go
with
the
internal
apple
cdroms
offered
as
options
in
the
and
vx
or
go
external
it
is
a
matter
of
price
and
reliability
the
second
being
very
important
how
much
ram
i
was
thinking
more
leaning
towards
what
do
you
think
ok
called
apple
educational
discounts
and
they
said
their
keyboard
extended
is
is
it
better
to
go
with
the
apple
and
their
long
time
great
wear
and
tear
record
or
is
there
a
rd
party
extended
keyboard
that
is
just
a
reliable
price
printers
one
color
printer
we
are
presently
leaning
towrds
the
thermal
wax
tektronic
e
or
i
probably
the
e
as
we
are
going
to
limit
access
so
we
dont
needed
the
is
networkability
so
what
do
you
think
in
terms
of
color
printers
different
brand
kind
dye
sublimation
ink
jet
price
companies
s
also
we
are
looking
to
get
a
laser
printer
or
such
to
network
into
the
whole
lab
for
noraml
printing
the
fornt
runner
is
the
apple
pro
is
that
right
dont
have
my
notes
here
at
suggestions
we
have
kids
using
these
things
all
day
if
this
lab
goes
through
and
they
know
nothing
about
it
for
the
most
part
it
has
to
be
reliable
easy
to
maintain
and
economical
ie
not
high
priced
paper
cartidges
etc
finally
and
this
is
my
little
dig
into
the
project
what
about
netting
these
things
we
have
ether
nearby
and
i
would
like
to
slap
the
macs
on
the
net
but
server
individual
ether
forget
about
it
it
is
going
to
be
astronomically
priced
and
the
school
is
going
to
laugh
at
you
when
you
ask
them
little
more
info
i
am
a
poli
sci
major
who
just
happens
to
know
alot
about
macs
but
this
is
a
bit
out
of
my
league
not
to
mention
i
dont
have
the
time
to
go
and
look
for
all
of
this
stuff
so
i
am
hoping
the
collective
resources
and
intelect
of
the
net
can
help
has
before
shameless
plug
buy
empower
