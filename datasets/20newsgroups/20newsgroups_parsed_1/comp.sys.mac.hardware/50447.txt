tests
well
here
are
the
results
of
the
mathematica
test
which
i
posted
to
this
newsgroup
the
test
was
the
following
command
plotdxy
x
y
xy
xyplotpoints
i
was
just
curious
how
fast
the
plot
command
would
be
executed
on
various
macintosh
machines
as
well
as
other
personal
computers
and
workstations
the
results
are
posted

funny
how
the
iisi
running
at
mhz
is
slower
than
other
equivalent
machines
lots
slower
in
fact
perhaps
the
version
of
mathematica
makes
a
difference
or
the
fact
that
not
much
ram
was
allocated
another
interesting
thing
is
how
fast
the
sgi
did
it
wow
basically
though
i
wouldnt
draw
any
conclusions
from
this
data
it
seems
that
mathematicas
speed
is
dependant
on
a
lot
of
variables
i
was
just
curious
how
different
machines
would
measure
up
well
if
you
have
any
questions
or
if
i
forgot
something
just
drop
me
a
line
at
chad
ps
if
the
spacing
of
the
above
table
doesnt
come
out
right
on
your
machine
tell
me
and
ill
mail
you
a
copy
of
this
