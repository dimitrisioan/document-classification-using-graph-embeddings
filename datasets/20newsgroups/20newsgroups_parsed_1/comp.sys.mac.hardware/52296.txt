i
bought
a
stylewriter
ii
a
couple
months
ago
and
lately
when
i
print
something
i
notice
white
lines
or
gaps
running
through
the
line
being
printed
its
almost
like
the
paper
is
advancing
a
smidge
too
far
when
advancing
lines
i
replaced
the
ink
cartridge
thinking
it
might
be
the
problem
but
the
lines
are
still
there
has
anyone
else
noticed
this
problem
whats
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
it
brian

i
had
a
similar
problem
with
my
stylewriter
i
the
original
have
you
tried
cleaning
the
print
heads
with
the
swii
driver
its
and
option
in
the
print
dialog
box
sometimes
i
had
to
do
it
several
times
to
get
the
crud
out
yes
it
wastes
ink
but
it
beats
those
white
annoying
lines
another
idea
is
to
print
a
couple
of
pages
with
just
a
big
black
box
it
can
help
to
get
the
ink
flowing
good
luck
