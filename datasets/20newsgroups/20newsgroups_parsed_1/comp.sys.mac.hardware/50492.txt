of

on
erg
keyboard

so
far
i
have
only
seen
pictures
of
the
new
ergonomic
keyboard
but
it
seems
that
the
b
is
placed
on
the
left
part
after
the
split
however
when
i
learned
typing
in
school
some
years
ago
i
was
taught
to
write
b
with
my
right
hand
is
this
a
difference
between
danish
and
american
typing
or
what
it
must
be
i
type
it
with
my
left
hand
personally
i
would
have
a
real
problem
with
my
keyboard
opened
up
like
that
because
i
tend
to
share
some
keys
with
both
hands
particularly
if
im
doing
something
else
with
one
hand
like
using
the
cursor
keys
mouse
or
glass
of
jolt

rose
amazing
but
true
there
is
so
much
sand
in
northern
africa
that
if
spread
out
it
would
cover
the
sahara
