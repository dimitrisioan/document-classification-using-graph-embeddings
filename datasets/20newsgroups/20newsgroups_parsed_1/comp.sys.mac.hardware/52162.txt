what
is
the
real
story
here
can
i
hook
up
any
pc
svga
montitor
to
the
centris
internal
video
do
i
need
to
make
my
own
cable
if
it
doesnt
not
come
with
one
has
apple
released
a
tech
note
with
the
pinouts
for
doing
such
the
reasoj
i
ask
is
that
it
seems
the
prices
for
svga
are
lower
than
that
of
their
mac
counterparts
first
of
all
i
wouldnt
advise
wasting
your
time
with
apple
theyll
treat
you
like
an
idiot
and
you
wont
get
any
answers
a
personal
opinion
the
safest
thing
to
do
is
match
the
svga
monitors
scanning
rates
with
apples
rates
i
dont
know
apples
video
scanning
rates
but
i
use
the
micron
xceed
s
rates
as
theyre
a
good
approximation
about
cables
you
just
have
to
go
out
to
someplace
like
frys
and
get
a
few
macvga
cables
and
try
them
out
i
have
a
viewsonic
e
and
i
use
an
nec
adaptor
other
monitors
may
use
other
adaptors
i
also
have
a
macx
adaptor
that
tricks
system
into
thinking
the
monitor
is
an
apple
i
need
to
readjust
the
vertical
and
horizontal
sizes
but
it
works
fairly
well
just
like
everything
else
in
life
the
right
lane
ends
in
half
a
mile
