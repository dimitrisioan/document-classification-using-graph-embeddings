am
looking

and
a

prices
the
iici
has
much
greater
potential
for
expansion
a

greater
memory
capacity
depends
on
the
price
you
can
get
the
ci
for
educationally
speaking
the
lciii
here
at
fsu
can
be
had
at
just
under
add
in
roughly
for
a
monitor
last
id
heard
an

lciii
simm
went
for
i
think
youre
in
a
winwin
situation
no
matter
what
you
decide
youll
most
likely
be
happy
with
it
james
yes
and
one
thing
to
think
about
is
the
pricing
on
the
m
harddrive
configuration
when
i
got
my
lowly
classic
ii
the
options
were
or
m
harddrives
and
it
was
clear
that
buying
another
m
of
harddrive
space
would
cost
much
more
than
the
difference
in
price
between
the
two
config
uartions
there
is
an
analogous
break
in
the
lciii
and
prices
and
you
will
not
regret
spending
the
extra
money
for
a
larger
harddrive
particularly
if
you
ever
wind
up
wanting
to
use
softpc
which
sets
up
a
severalmb
up
to
partition
or
if
you
are
generating
large
files
with
dtp
software
or
if
you
might
ever
want
to
check
out
a
mac
unixlike
os
like
machten
having
the
extra
space
will
be
helpful
when
you
are
pricing
used
iicis
look
at
the
harddrive
size
they
come
with
and
how
much
it
would
cost
you
to
add
more
storage
down
the
road
might
be
a
useful
bargaining
strategy
even
if
you
see
no
reason
to
go
over
m
though
i
must
admit
that
i
am
such
a
packrat
that
within
months
of
getting
my
computer
i
was
backing
up
a
lot
of
stuff
to
floppies
that
i
rarely
use
to
because
i
was
running
out
of
space
without
having
started
using
dtp
stuff
softpc
or
trying
any
unix
os
