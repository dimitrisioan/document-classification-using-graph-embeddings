mike
a
professor
of
mine
once
said
the
difference
between
a
computer
engineer
and
a
computer
scientist
is
about
meaning
the
engineer
makes
more
than
the
cs
seriously
though
the
main
difference
is
that
most
cs
people
write
programs
that
people
will
use
ie
database
graphics
word
processors
etc
while
an
engineer
writes
for
machines
or
control
systems
ie
the
computer
in
your
car
a
flight
control
system
computer
controled
devices
etc
in
other
words
cs
writes
software
while
cse
writes
firmware
these
are
generalizations
but
for
the
most
part
that
is
what
the
difference
is
ps
the
is
not
just
a
joke
