im
going
to
buy
a
daystar
with
mhz
for
the
se
since
there
were
so
many
mails
about
problems
with
this
board
my
questions
does
the
board
work
with
and
aux
does
anybody
know
problems
with
any
kind
of
software
well
i
havent
seen
any
reports
of
problems
with
the
turbo
but
to
my
knowledge
daystar
has
not
released
a
version
of
the
board
that
works
with
anything
but
the
iisi
and
iici
and
they
have
not
finished
tweakingtesting
for
use
with
aux
this
may
not
happen
until
the
aux
upgrade
is
released
my
guess
so
id
recommend
waiting
or
buying
the
mhz
board
and
upgrade
later
when
aux
compatibility
is
assured
turbo
interface
cards
for
the
ii
iix
se
iicx
etc
will
probably
be
available
sooner
but
if
aux
compatibility
is
a
requirement
it
is
probably
best
to
be
patient
and
let
someone
else
be
the
pioneer
an
added
advantate
of
waiting
for
the
daystar
for
the
se
is
that
just
as
with
the
power
cache
the
accelerator
will
plug
into
the
cpu
socket
leaving
the
pds
slot
free
for
a
video
card
or
ethernet
card
with
daystars
upgrade
path
its
a
no
lose
situation
