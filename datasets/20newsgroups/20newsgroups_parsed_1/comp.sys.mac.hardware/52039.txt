according
to
macweek
of
the
cyclone
will
come
in
the
same
metal
minitower
case
as
the
quadra
while
the
tempest
will
share
the
lowslung
case
of
the
centris
apple
will
offer
a
miniature
video
camera
that
can
be
mounted
above
the
users
monitor
or
moved
about
on
the
end
of
its
cable
to
take
pictures
of
objects
or
documents
taking
advantage
of
the
bit
digital
signal
processor
dsp
built
into
the
systems
logic
boards
the
camera
will
be
able
to
put
an
image
measuring
by
pixels
with
gray
levels
on
the
screen
users
will
be
able
to
install
supplementary
lenses
that
can
record
detail
as
fine
as
the
wire
bonds
on
an
integrated
circuit
the
camera
is
expected
to
cost
between
and
the
systems
will
ship
with
all
the
software
needed
to
put
apples
casper
voicerecognition
technology
to
work
users
apparently
will
have
to
purchase
an
operational
highfidelity
microphone
the
two
models
will
talk
as
well
as
listen
a
new
system
facility
called
the
speech
manager
will
convert
text
strings
sent
by
applications
to
phonemes
and
then
pass
them
to
a
speech
synthesizer
the
cyclone
will
include
a
mhz
three
nubus
slots
and
support
for
up
to
mb
of
ram
the
tempest
will
use
a
mhz
lc
lacking
an
fpu
and
hold
up
to
mb
of
ram
it
will
have
a
single
slot
that
will
require
a
nubus
adapter
and
have
room
for
only
inch
nubus
cards
users
will
be
able
to
update
the
tempests
process
but
not
the
cyclones
for
more
get
the
issue
of
macweek
