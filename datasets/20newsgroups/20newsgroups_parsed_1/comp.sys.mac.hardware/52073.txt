subject
pb
and
extended
keyboard
hello
i
saw
this
question
posted
a
week
or
so
ago
but
as
far
as
i
could
tell
no
answer
appeared
on
the
net
what
is
the
good
oil
on
connecting
the
apple
extended
keyboard
to
a
powerbook
the
earlier
questioner
wonderd
if
this
would
be
too
much
of
a
load
for
the
pb
and
as
i
want
to
connect
just
such
a
beast
i
am
curious
i
havent
got
a
pb
yet
so
i
cant
rtfm
but
i
assume
that
a
standard
keyboard
with
a
mouse
would
be
ok
as
the
spec
sheet
i
read
mentioned
connecting
an
external
keyboard
but
is
the
extended
plus
mouse
pushing
it
any
help
gratefully
recieved
i
will
summarise
to
the
net
if
necessary
thanks
john
collins
ps
i
am
thinking
of
a
pb
but
i
assume
that
this
would
apply
to
all
pbs
