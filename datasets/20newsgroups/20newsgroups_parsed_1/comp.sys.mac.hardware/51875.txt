re
quadra
sound
the
quadra
goes
thru
extensive
initalize
routines
of
its
hardware
reads
pram
obtains
all
info
from
last
session
including
the
volume
setting
and
then
executes
the
sound
procedure
for
the
startup
sound
and
waits
on
the
scsi
controller
to
respond
to
the
boot
up
code
if
the
dram
produces
an
error
or
a
registers
can
not
be
read
from
a
device
or
the
device
corrupts
that
addressdata
or
control
paths
then
if
it
is
possible
the
firmware
branchs
to
another
sound
routine
that
produces
the
sad
mac
sound
this
is
a
general
breifing
of
the
start
up
procedure
of
a
typical
mac
if
you
can
not
control
the
volume
of
the
quadra
even
at
boot
up
then
i
feel
there
is
something
incorrect
with
the
logic
board
my
quadra
does
not
show
the
problems
you
are
having
