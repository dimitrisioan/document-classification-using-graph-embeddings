from
i
remember
reading
a
thread
a
few
days
ago
that
mentioned
removing
an
external
syquest
drive
from
its
case
and
dropping
it
in
the
internal
drive
of
a
centris
i
was
going
to
do
that
with
my
but
had
a
couple
of
questions
my
pli
m
syquest
drive
has
a
wire
from
the
drive
to
an
id
switch
on
the
outside
of
the
case
where
do
i
connect
this
switch
can
the
computer
just
tell
with
internal
drives
i
noticed
that
the
drive
will
lay
over
part
of
the
motherboard
i
didnt
look
closely
but
i
seem
to
recall
it
laying
over
the
ram
thats
soldered
onto
the
motherboard
would
that
cause
problems
one
last
question
is
there
anywhere
to
order
a
faceplate
cover
the
drives
front
panel
is
smaller
than
the
space
left
in
the
case
the
drives
panel
is
the
same
size
as
the
spotsbm
clones
cases
should
i
just
cut
a
hole
in
the
plastic
panel
that
is
currently
holding
tmpty
place
ans
are
welcomed
thanks
