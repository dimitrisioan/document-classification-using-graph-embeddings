re
centris
video
problem
im
having
it
also
date
sat
apr
gmt
when
the
computer
is
set
for
colors
and
certain
operations
are
done
particularly
vertical
scrolling
through
a
window
horizontal
white
lines
appear
on
the
monitor
which
generally
but
not
always
spare
open
windows
these
lines
accummulate
as
the
operation
is
continued
if
a
window
is
moved
over
the
involved
area
of
the
screen
and
then
moved
away
the
line
disappear
from
that
area
of
the
screen
this
problem
is
not
observed
if
the
monitor
is
configured
for
colors
or
a
inch
apple
monitor
with
colors
is
used
i
suspect
a
bad
video
ram
chip
but
can
not
be
certain
the
problem
has
been
apparent
since
day
but
has
gotten
worse
etc
has
anyone
not
had
these
problems
in
the
given
configurations
that
would
help
eliminate
design
flaw
as
the
explanation
as
a
data
point
im
using
a
centris
with
the
apple
monitor
and
do
not
have
these
problems
