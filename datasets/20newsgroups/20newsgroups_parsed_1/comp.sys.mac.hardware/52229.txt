why

the
most
likely
explanation
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
a
greater
density
of
information
exists
on
the
larger
capacity
disk
drive
than
the
smaller
one
if
your
running
the
drive
on
a
mac
i
would
recommend
a
shareware
utility
called
timedrive
which
tests
seek
scsi
throughput
and
rotational
speed
this
utility
should
let
you
know
what
the
differences
are
between
the

larger
drives
tend
to
have
multipule
platters
which
can
allow
adjacent
bits
to
be
read
in
parallel
resulting
in
higher
throughput
they
also
have
higher
spindle
speeds
which
leads
to
both
increased
throughput
and
reduced
seek
times
due
to
reduction
of
rotational
latency
