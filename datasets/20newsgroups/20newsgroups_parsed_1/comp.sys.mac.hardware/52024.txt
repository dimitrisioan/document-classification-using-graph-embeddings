mac
ii
vi
to
be
discontinued
good
buy
a
local
dealer
is
offering
mac
ii
vi
machines
equipped
with
kodak
multi
session
compatible
cdrom
drives
for
what
seems
like
an
attractive
price
ive
used
many
other
models
up
to
a
ii
ci
but
this
would
be
the
first
i
could
have
my
own
mac
is
it
safe
to
buy
an
abouttobe
discontinued
model
such
as
this
id
like
to
yank
the
cdrom
drive
out
put
it
in
a
housing
and
share
it
with
my
pc
is
this
feasible
the
only
info
i
have
on
the
ii
vi
is
that
it
is
relatively
slow
mhz
has
an
chip
with
a
math
coprocessor
i
want
to
add
a
nonapple
portrait
monitor
and
use
this
machine
for
hypercard
stack
design
is
this
a
good
buy
or
would
i
be
wasting
my
money
i
would
appreciate
some
advice
thanks
