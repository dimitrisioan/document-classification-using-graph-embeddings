is
it
wise
to
even
think
about
removing
the
annoying
fan
from
my
classic
i
have
no
warranty
to
void
and
where
do
i
get
a
screwdriver
to
fit
in
those
funny
screws

my
opinions
only
to
every
complex
problem
there
exists
an
easy
solution
thats
not
correct
the
screws
are
torx
screws
and
the
tool
isnt
to
hard
to
find
its
a
matter
of
finding
one
with
a
long
enough
shaft
to
do
the
trick
no
it
is
not
a
good
idea
to
take
that
fan
out
why
because
it
will
cause
stuff
to
over
heat
internal
hard
drives
motherboardyou
name
it
and
this
can
cause
damage
ive
known
people
to
have
hard
drive
failures
because
of
fans
that
didnt
work
right
