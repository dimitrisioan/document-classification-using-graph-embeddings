i
dont
know
about
the
instrutech
boards
though
i
plan
to
check
them
out
but
you
need
to
be
very
careful
checking
the
monotonicity
and
sn
ratio
of
many
of
the
bit
boards
out
there
the
ni
boards
are
very
clearly
specified
in
terms
of
monotonicity
sn
ratio
accuracy
etc
and
the
nba
and
nba
have
all
the
dyynamic
range
and
freedom
from
distortion
that
youd
expect
from
a
good
true
bit
converter
this
is
not
true
for
the
spectral
innovations
boards
for
example
to
boorishly
reply
to
myself
i
found
i
did
have
the
instrutech
information
already
the
specs
to
use
the
term
loosely
are
as
follows
ad
bit
converter
with
bit
accuracy
to
khz
bit
accuracy
to
khz
no
specs
for
sn
monotonicity
linearity
there
are
multiplexed
inputs
sharing
the
single
ad
so
that
all
inputs
are
not
samples
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
above
conversion
specs
the
allchannel
sample
rate
must
be
used
thus
for
two
channels
you
only
have
unknown
quality
bits
at
khz
per
channel
this
is
poorer
quality
than
the
national
instruments
at
the
same
sample
rate
da
bit
converter
no
specs
for
sn
monotonicity
linearity
each
of
the
output
channels
has
its
own
converter
the
price
for
the
external
converter
box
the
itc
the
nubus
interface
board
the
mac
plus
c
driver
software
and
igor
xops
is
rather
steep
