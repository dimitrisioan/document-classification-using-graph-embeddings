re
iisi
clock
upgrades
i
too
have
been
watching
the
iisi
speedup
reports
and
plan
to
upgrade
in
the
next
few
weeks
the
plan
i
have
is
to
build
a
small
board
with
a
few
different
crystals
on
it
and
to
be
able
to
switch
between
the
different
speeds
using
a
front
pannel
switch
this
way
i
can
get
the
speed
when
i
want
but
i
can
also
run
at
slower
stock
speeds
it
i
experience
any
compatability
problems
with
any
applications
i
dont
expect
to
be
able
to
switch
clock
speeds
with
the
system
running
but
if
i
can
switch
without
any
lockup
problems
then
i
could
switch
to
mhz
when
needed
and
put
it
back
to
idle
mhz
when
not
needeed
this
would
further
reduce
the
wearandtear
on
the
cpu
even
with
a
heat
sink
of
course
i
would
not
want
to
run
the
different
clock
signals
through
the
switch
but
use
a
chip
or
two
on
the
board
to
select
the
frequency
desired
and
route
it
directly
to
the
mother
board
i
havent
started
probing
around
inside
my
si
yet
does
anyone
know
the
voltage
level
to
power
the
crystal
oscilators
