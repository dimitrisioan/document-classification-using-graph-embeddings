i
hear
that
the
performa
is
really
an
lciii
with
an
internal
modem
can
the
modem
part
be
obtained
and
installed
in
an
lciii
it
would
be
nice
if
it
were
actually
a
powerbook
internal
modem
but
that
might
be
too
much
to
hope
for
i
believe
you
were
misinformed

checked
out
one
of
the
ps
at
sears

week

modem
is
external
bps
data
with
sendonly
