sony
dat
retrospect
ci
problems
hi
im
having
problems
tying
to
get
a
sony
dat
drive
to
work
im
using
retrospect
ci
and
my
only
luck
with
getting
the
drive
to
work
has
been
with
a
mac
iici
which
has
now
unfortunately
gone
to
another
department
ideally
we
want
to
attach
it
to
our
quadra
setup
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
retrospect
software
to
recognize
the
media
at
all
when
in
the
devices
dialog
it
can
see
the
dat
device
but
comes
up
with
firstly
running
secondly
media
failure
and
then
immediately
contents
unknown
this
does
not
happen
with
the
mac
iici
setup
which
simply
says
ready
im
hoping
someone
else
will
have
had
similar
problems
but
found
some
solution
i
know
some
others
who
have
had
problems
with
dat
devices
and
their
quadra
but
they
have
a
mac
iici
which
they
can
use
the
symptoms
system
software
is
also
didnt
work
with
i
have
tried
the
following
turn
off
all
extensions
except
retrospect
scsi
required
tested
on
a
variety
of
machines
quadra
iisi
and
lc
at
least
connected
no
other
scsi
devices
tested
all
varieties
of
scsi
termination
etc
replaced
the
dat
unit
with
a
new
one
yes
we
got
that
desperate
read
the
retrospect
manual
even
more
desperate
replies
via
email
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks
in
advance
ill
post
any
solutions
to
this
group
