i
am
looking
for
one
of
those
color
lcd
screens
you
place
on
an
overhead
projector
and
control
the
presentation
with
a
mac
can
you
recommend
me
a
particular
brand
what
price
are
we
talking
about
for
a
good
display
you
must
get
an
active
matrix
panel
and
a
very
bright
overhead
projector
designed
to
be
used
with
an
lcd
panel
ie
stage
must
not
get
too
hot
i
tried
out
a
proxima
ovation
unit
and
liked
it
but
i
needed
a
brighter
projector
i
used
it
with
a
m
it
is
also
too
expensive
for
what
you
get
imho
prices
of
active
matrix
panels
are
rumoured
to
drop
substantially
sometime
this
year
something
to
do
with
tarrifs
being
lifted
i
think
in
canadian
dollars
the
proxima
ovation
models
ranged
in
price
from
about
to
and
a
good
overhead
projector
about
to
for
that
kind
of
money
you
can
get
a
brighter
image
from
a
three
beam
projector
but
sacrifice
portability
oh
yes
proper
room
lighting
is
extremely
important
especially
if
you
want
your
audience
to
have
enough
light
to
read
handouts
and
not
have
that
light
wash
out
your
display
at
the
front
of
the
room
tricky
to
get
right
