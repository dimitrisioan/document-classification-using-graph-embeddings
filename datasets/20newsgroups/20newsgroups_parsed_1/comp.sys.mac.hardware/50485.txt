thanks
apple
free
ethernet
on
my
c
well
i
just
got
my
centris
yesterday
it
took
just
over
two
weeks
from
placing
the
order
the
dealer
rutgers
computer
store
appologized
because
apple
made
a
substitution
on
my
order
i
ordered
the
one
without
ethernet
but
they
substituted
one
with
ethernet
he
wanted
to
know
if
that
would
be
alright
with
me
they
must
be
backlogged
on
centri
wout
ethernet
so
theyre
just
shipping
them
with
anyway
im
very
happy
with
the
with
a
few
exceptions
being
nosy
i
decided
to
open
it
up
before
powering
it
on
for
the
first
time
the
scsi
cable
to
the
hard
drive
was
only
partially
connected
must
have
come
loose
in
shipping
no
big
deal
but
i
would
have
been
pissed
if
i
tried
to
boot
it
and
it
wouldnt
come
up
the
hard
drive
also
has
an
annoying
high
pitched
whine
ive
heard
apple
will
exchange
it
if
you
complain
so
i
might
try
to
get
it
swapped
i
am
also
dissappionted
by
the
lack
of
soft
poweronoff
this
wasnt
mentioned
in
any
of
the
literature
i
saw
also
the
location
of
the
resetinterupt
buttons
is
awful
having
keyboard
control
for
these
functions
was
much
more
convenient
oh
and
the
screen
seems
tojump
in
a
wierd
way
on
powerup
ive
seen
this
mentioned
by
others
so
it
must
be
afeature
anyway
above
all
its
fast
a
great
machine
at
a
great
price
