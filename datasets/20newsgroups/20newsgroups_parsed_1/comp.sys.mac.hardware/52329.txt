i
understand
that
if
i
have
a
correct
adapter
then
i
can
use
a
vga
monitor
with
my
iisi
are
those
adapters
working
with
specific
brands
is
adapter
for
nec
or
sony
working
with
other
brands
i
will
be
using
a
vga
monitor
with
iisi
for
a
month
soon
i
dont
have
any
clue
what
monitor
will
be
heres
the
story
the
iisi
can
not
supply
a
vga
output
however
some
vgatype
monitors
can
adequately
deal
with
the
video
signal
the
mac
uses
to
drive
the
apple
or
inch
high
resolution
color
displayie
apples
own
x
mode
so
if
you
wish
to
hook
one
of
these
monitors
up
to
your
iisi
you
need
a
an
adapter
that
converts
from
the
mac
db
connector
to
the
vgastyle
high
density
db
connector
but
tells
the
mac
to
use
its
own
x
mode
not
the
vga
x
mode
and
b
a
vga
monitor
that
can
deal
with
the
higher
bandwidth
of
the
mac
x
mode
over
the
vga
x
mode
which
as
i
stated
in
above
the
iisi
can
not
produce
as
far
as
a
above
is
concerned

they
can
probably
get
you
the
right
adapter
remember
you
do
not
want
the
runofthemill
mactovga
adapter
because
it
will
try
to
have
your
iisi
produce
the
vga
mode
which
it
can
not
the
computer
will
just
fail
to
produce
any
video
signal
at
all
instead
you
want
an
adapter
that
connects
between
the
macstyle
and
vgastyle
connectors
but
tells
the
mac
to
use
the
apple
x
mode
sorry
for
the
poor
terminology
available
for
describing
this
distinction
as
far
as
b
is
concerned
make
sure
to
get
a
monitor
that
can
deal
with
a
horizontal
bandwidth
of
khz
and
a
vertical
retrace
rate
of
hz
these
are
the
specs
of
apples
x
mode
for
comparison
the
vgastandard
x
mode
uses
a
khz
horizontal
bandwidth
and
a
hz
vertical
retrace
rate
the
monitor
will
probably
need
to
have
autosynching
capability
as
the
apple
mode
youll
be
using
isnt
one
of
the
set
of
standard
modes
in
the
pc
compatible
world
good
luck
