how
do
i
expand
ram
on
a
plus
i
have
a
mac
plus
with
mb
ram
i
have
just
bought
an
extra
mb
so
that
i
can
have
the
max
mb
ram
that
a
plus
supports
however
i
cant
get
it
to
boot
after
i
install
the
extra
simms
instead
i
get
a
sad
mac
sorry
but
i
cant
remember
the
code
looking
at
the
motherboard
i
can
see
that
resistors
have
been
snipped
off
where
it
says
kb
path
row
i
assume
that
was
done
when
the
first
mb
simms
were
added
so
my
question
is
are
there
any
other
resistors
that
need
snipping
or
do
i
have
bum
simms
which
need
to
be
exchanged
any
and
all
advice
will
be
appreciated
