problem
mentioned
last
is
a
known
quadra
scsi
problem
it
was
heavily
discussed
last
year
and
an
apple
employee
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
one
byte
error
in
the
scsi
driver
routine
for
the
quadras
at
least
the
and
system
should
not
have
that
problem
for
most
people
the
solution
was
to
get
an
updated
driver
from
the
drive
manufactor
in
my
case
mass
microsystems
wrote
a
new
driver
which
fixed
the
problem
on
my
quadra

that
occured
early
last
year

know
if
there
is
an
updated
driver
