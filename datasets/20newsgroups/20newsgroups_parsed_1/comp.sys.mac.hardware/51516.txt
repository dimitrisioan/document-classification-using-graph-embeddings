re
ad
conversion
i
am
working
a
data
acquisition
and
analysis
program
to
collect
data
from
insect
sensory
organs
another
alternative
is
the
use
of
the
sound
input
port
can
you
really
make
due
with
the
nonexistent
dynamic
range
of
an
bit
converter
of
probably
dubious
linearity
and
monotonicity
and
perhaps
accoupled
as
well
it
would
depend
on
the
requirements
of
the
posters
data
for
some
purposes
resolution
with
or
without
calibration
curve
otherwise
the
other
possibilities
would
be
get
a
digital
voltameter
with
serial
output
connect
to
serial
port
on
mac
collect
data
with
some
communications
program
buy
an
ad
chip
from
analog
devices
burrbrown
etc
connect
to
a
parallel
to
serial
converter
use
serial
port
for
acquisition
nah
too
much
soldering
and
trouble
shooting
get
a
board
from
national
instruments
data
translation
omega
etal
the
finest
solution
but
possibly
the
most
costly
to
the
original
poster
if
the
signal
is
too
large
why
not
use
a
voltage
divider
two
resistors
cost
very
cheap
