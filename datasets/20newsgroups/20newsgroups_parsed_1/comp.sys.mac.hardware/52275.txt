writes
a
rep
at
the
dealer
actually
its
a
university
order
center
so
they
dont
have
any
immediate
financial
interest
told
me
that
they
have
been
having
lots
of
problems
with
their
centris
he
didnt
go
into
details
but
mentioned
problems
with
the
floppy
drive
and
intermittent
problems
with
printing
files
it
sounded
to
me
like
they
were
having
both
hardware
problems
and
software
compatibility
problems
with
the
machine
hes
not
recommending
the
centris
to
anybody
he
says
to
consider
a
centris
or
a
iivx
why
he
would
recommend
a
iivx
over
an
lciii
i
dont
know
but
thats
what
he
said
so
what
does
the
net
think
did
the
dealer
just
get
one
flaky
machine
or
did
apple
send
the
c
out
the
door
too
early
is
your
c
working
just
great
or
is
it
buggy
too
