writes
just
a
quick
summary
of
recent
findings
re
high
speed
modems
top
three
contenders
seem
to
be
att
paradyne
zyxel
and
us
robotics
zyxel
has
the
biggest
cult
following
and
can
be
had
for
under
but
i
ignored
it
because
i
need
something
with
mac
software
which
will
work
without
any
tweaking
you
shouldnt
have
ignored
the
zyxel
it
can
be
purchased
with
a
mac
bundle
which
includes
a
hardwarehandshaking
cable
and
faxstf
software
the
bundle
adds
between
and
to
the
price
of
the
modem
depending
on
the
supplier
it
is
true
that
the
modem
has
no
macspecific
docs
but
it
doesnt
require
much
tweaking
aside
from
setting
d
in
the
init
string
to
enable
hardware
handshaking
for
more
information
on
the
zyxel
including
sources
look
at
various
files
on
sumexaimstanfordedu
in
infomacreport
disclaimer
i
have
no
affiliation
with
zyxel
though
i
did
buy
a
zyxel
a
ue
modem
