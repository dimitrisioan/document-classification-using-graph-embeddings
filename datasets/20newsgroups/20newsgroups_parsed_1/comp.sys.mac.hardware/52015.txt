recently
bought

several
months
ago
i
bought
a
pb
with
external
floppy
appletalk
remote
access
a
kensington
case
and
ac
adapter
with
complete
documentation
and
in
almost
new
condition
used
for
us
i
considered
it
a
very
good
buy
and
am
very
cosy
with
my
little
baby
now
murray
put
me
down
for
a
pb
with
ext
floppy
appletalk
remote
acces
ac
adapter
and
fresh
out
of
box
was
used
but
buyer
switched
to
on
arrival
and
sold
unopened
box
purchased
last
october
for
later
i
bought
a
used
powerport
v
bps
internal
faxmodem
for
something
like
im
using
right
now
works
great
no
real
complaints
i
love
my
portable
system
got
a
color
home
setup
also
mac
ii
reasoning
was
that
matlab
programs
at
school
and
other
simulations
of
dynamic
control
systems
sometimes
took
hours
or
overnight
to
run
tying
up
my
mac
ii
i
got
the
pb
with
fast
modem
to
do
light
work
and
ontherun
stuff
i
figured
id
give
it
to
my
little
sister
next
year
when
she
goes
to
college
its
running
system
now
without
any
problems
also
i
sometimes
do
dec
terminal
emulations
with
matlab
on
our
universitys
vaxvms
nice
thing
that
it
benchmarks
itself
as
an
average
of
times
faster
than
a
mac
iifx
so
the
pb
just
does
graphical
output
and
terminal
emulation
not
too
hard
at
all
for
it
it
was
a
fabulous
setup
weeee
by
the
way
all
matlab
software
was
on
class
accounts
i
was
also
the
ta
for
a
class
that
used
simulabsimulink
we
had
sitelicense
and
takehome
thendestroy
later
siterelease
licenses
no
pirating
there
incase
youre
wondering
great
program
just
like
to
add
whatever
future
system
you
get
you
can
almost
never
get
enuff
memory
buy
it
while
its
cheap
that
is
buy
it
when
you
get
the
computer
since
its
usually
cheaper
than
upgrading
i
always
run
out
of
disk
space
but
i
have
a
syquest
on
the
mac
iisi
so
i
never
worried
about
space
before
got
several
carts
