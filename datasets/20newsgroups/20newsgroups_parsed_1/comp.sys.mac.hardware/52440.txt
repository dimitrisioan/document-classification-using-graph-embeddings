datatransferrate
of
the
new
series
fs
micropolis
hds
i
have
a
question
for
yall
im
looking
at
an
ad
for
the
new
fast
scsi
drives
from
micropolis
in
the
june
macworld
i
have
seen
similar
ads
for
the
ide
versions
in
ibm
pc
magazines
well
the
ad
says
that
all
three
drives
have
a
fast
scsi
interface
but
then
it
says
that
the
dtr
rate
for
each
drive
is
megabytessecond
max
how
can
this
be
i
thought
that
if
a
drive
was
to
be
fast
scsi
it
had
to
have
a
dtr
of
megs
a
second
i
am
assuming
the
megssec
claim
by
micropolis
is
from
the
k
cache
i
admit
that
i
would
be
very
impressed
if
the
drive
can
readwrite
data
at
megs
a
second
thank
you
