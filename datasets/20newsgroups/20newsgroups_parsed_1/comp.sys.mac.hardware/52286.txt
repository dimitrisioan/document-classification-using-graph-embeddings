when
i
owned
a

and
wanted
to
upgrade
its
memory
i

an
antistatic
ive
had
success
just
jamming
a
standard
screwdriver
in
the
slots
banging
it
in
with
a
hammer
and
twisting
away
then
i
throw
the
darn
things
away
and
put
real
screws
in
there
methinks
they
did
this
just
to
sell
us
the
damn
screwdrivers
