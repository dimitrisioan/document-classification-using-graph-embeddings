asante
ethernet
adapter
for
lciii
math
chip
hi
i
have
been
told
by
a
local
sales
that
asante
has
come
out
with
this
lciii
pds
ethernet
adapter
with
an
optional
socket
on
the
board
my
question
is
will
the
fpu
performance
degrade
will
i
put
the
on
the
pds
card
socket
instead
of
on
the
motherboard
itself
intuitively
the
math
coprocessor
should
always
be
placed
close
to
the
cpu
but
i
am
not
sure
how
good
apples
socalled
processordirect
slot
is
when
it
comes
to
throughout
does
anyone
know
the
answer
to
this
or
have
any
experience
with
the
asante
lciii
ethernet
adapter
thanks
in
advance
