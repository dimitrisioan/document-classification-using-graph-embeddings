ive
seen
the
following
problem
om
three
mac
iisi
machines
all
with
mb
ram
installed
or
ns
simms
if
the
contents
of
a
window
are
being
calculated
and
updated
a
lot
of
strange
horizontal
lines
are
temporarily
generated
on
the
screen
the
lines
translate
to
the
top
of
the
screen
and
have
a
slightly
lower
brightness
than
their
surroundings
they
are
a
few
millimeters
apart
i
admit
that
they
are
vague
but
they
can
still
be
distinguished
clearly
especially
if
the
environment
ie
the
rest
of
the
room
is
a
bit
dark
applications
which
produce
this
effect
are
the
previewer
of
directtex
ie
dvireader
kaleidagraph
fpu
another
program
which
produces
this
effect
is
spyglass
transform
while
contouring
a
big
array
thanks
for
any
information
about
this
problem
