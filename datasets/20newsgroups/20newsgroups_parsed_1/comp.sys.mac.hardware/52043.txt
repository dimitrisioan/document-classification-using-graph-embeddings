so
i
finally
decided
to
risk
this
upgrade
faq
in
hand
ive
gathered
the
pieces
together
the
only
problem
is
that
i
havent
been
able
to
find
anyone
whos
even
heard
of
thermal
tapeglue
which
is
what
the
faq
recommends
for
attaching
the
heat
sink
i
am
just
tempted
to
use
duct
tape
here
anyone
hae
any
ideas
for
me
for
attaching
the
heat
sink
to
the
processor
much
thanks
just
use
a
thin
film
of
epoxy
thats
what
i
did
epoxy
conducts
heat
fairly
well
and
my
heat
sink
gets
warm
to
prove
it
i
looked
for
the
stuff
myself
my
local
ee
jocks
said
to
use
epoxy

fun
