its
not
a
good
idea
to
have
a
horizontally
formatted
hard
disk
in
a
vertical
position
if
the
drive
is
formatted
in
a
horizontal
position
it
can
not
completely
compensate
for
the
gravitational
pull
in
a
vertical
position
im
not
saying
that
your
hard
disk
will
fail
tomorrow
or
months
from
now
but
why
take
that
chance
if
you
want
more
detailed
info
on
the
problem
please
i
think
the
other
replies
sum
up
the
fact
that
you
can
place
a
hard
drive
on
its
side
the
point
is
this
will
only
be
sure
to
work
on
the
new
drives
namely
ht
lps
drives
that
have
a
smaller
platter
and
are
also
more
stable
why
should
i
take
the
chance
because
ive
been
running
a
maxtor
ht
lps
on
both
its
side
and
flat
for
about
a
year
and
ive
had
no
problems
with
it
period
like
i
always
say
never
trust
the
manufacturer
just
like
everything
else
in
life
the
right
lane
ends
in
half
a
mile
