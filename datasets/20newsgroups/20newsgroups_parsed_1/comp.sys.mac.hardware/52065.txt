yes
i
know
computers
and
harddisk
drives
should
be
always
on
but
what
about
monitors
they
generate
a
lots
of
heat
should
i
or
shouldnt
i
keep
them
on
hours
a
day
any
advice
well
the
monitor
is
consistently
the
largest
power
drain
on
your
electric
bill
when
you
are
looking
at
your
computer
setup
especially
if
you
have
a
large
or
greater
color
monitor
generally
what
i
do
is
leave
my
mac
on
all
the
time
except
for
the
occasional
resart
or
syetem
crash
but
i
turn
my
monitor
off
each
night
before
i
leave
my
office
i
also
turn
off
after
dark
when
i
do
this
since
there
is
no
reason
to
have
the
screen
saver
running
when
there
is
no
picture
being
displyed
on
the
monitors
tube
actually
i
thought
macs
were
suppoused
to
be
restarted
once
a
day
really
what
makes
you
think
this
the
q
file
server
in
my
office
has
been
on
for
the
last
months
straight
and
it
hasnt
had
any
problems
note
i
also
keep
the
monitor
for
the
file
server
turned
off
when
im
not
actually
working
on
the
server
itself
hades
