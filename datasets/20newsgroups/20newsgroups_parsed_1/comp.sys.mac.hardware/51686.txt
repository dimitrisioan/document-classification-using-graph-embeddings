hi
what
alternatives
to
the
express
modem
do
duo
owners
have
if
they
want
to
go
at
least
baud
every
place
in
town
says
they
are
back
ordered
and
part
of
the
reason
i
want
a
laptop
mac
is
so
i
can
use
it
as
a
remote
terminal
from
wherever
i
am
but
i
really
would
hate
to
have
to
wait
months
to
get
a
modem
in
or
have
to
settle
with
baud
youre
not
going
to
like
this
but
if
memory
serves
me
postings
ive
read
in
this
newsgroup
and
elsewhere
indicate
that
there
are
no
repeat
no
internal
modems
for
the
duo
besides
the
express
modem
at
any
speed
something
having
to
do
with
the
modem
using
the
main
cpu
for
some
of
its
tasks
and
apple
not
releasing
details
on
the
architecture
or
something
im
vague
on
the
details
but
the
gist
was
that
there
are
going
to
be
no
thirdparty
internal
duo
modems
if
im
wrong
somebody
please
correct
me
on
this
sorry
to
be
the
bearer
of
bad
news

i
myself
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
what
feminism
is
i
only
know
that
i
am
called
a
feminist
whenever
i
express
sentiments
that
differentiate
me
from
a
doormat
