re
halfpage
hand
scanners
the
logitech
scanman
is
a
nice
unit
compact
and
effective
it
will
bring
in
graphics
with
surprisingly
good
quality
note
that
its
effective
resolution
in
grey
scale
mode
is
only
about
dpi
if
you
dont
intend
to
magnify
a
graphic
it
works
fine
a
true
level
gray
scanner
would
work
better
for
images
ive
seen
the
scanman
go
for
as
little
as
used
it
is
a
reasonable
buy
at
that
price
higher
end
hand
scanners
are
almost
as
expensive
as
used
flat
bed
scanners
here
is
seattle
the
paper
shows
occasional
good
bargains
in
the
classifieds
used
color
flat
beds
have
been
seen
as
lows
as
lately
grey
scale
flatbeds
come
in
around
