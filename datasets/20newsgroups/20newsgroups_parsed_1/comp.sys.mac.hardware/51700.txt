scsi
woes
on
mac
iifx
according
to
the
official
documentation
failure
to
use
the
iifx
terminator
can
not
only
affect
scsi
bus
performance
but
can
also
damage
the
bus
whether
this
is
your
problem
or
not
i
dont
know
i
have
had
sporadic
scsi
problems
with
my
iifx
since
i
bought
it
i
can
not
connect
more
than
three
devices
fourth
one
causes
major
problems
first
thing
to
do
is
to
try
to
reformat
your
drive
on
someone
elses
system
if
you
continue
to
get
errors
it
is
probably
the
drive
if
it
formats
fine
then
i
would
try
to
format
it
on
your
system
with
no
externals
if
this
fails
then
the
scsi
controller
on
your
iifx
needs
repairreplacement
hope
this
helps
