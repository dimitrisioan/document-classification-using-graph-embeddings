a
friend
of
mine
who
owns
a
pc
said
that
he
recently
got
a
program
that
can
format
a
disk
that
can
exceed
the
normal
capacity
of
a
hd
disk
apparently
it
rewrites
the
driver
or
takes
or
the
driver
or
something
that
allows
it
get
more
space
out
of
a
normal
hd
floppy
disk
it
supposedly
gets
upto
megs
so
something
like
k
i
dont
have
the
program
since
i
cant
use
it
and
its
supposed
to
be
called
something
like
form
or
something
like
that
my
question
is
whether
its
possible
to
do
this
on
the
mac
and
if
its
not
possible
is
it
due
to
hardware
limitations
a
developer
friend
of
mine
said
that
it
might
be
possible
but
he
doesnt
deal
with
this
aspect
of
the
field
much
thanks
for
any
information
contributed
