running
mathematica
on
a
pb
heres
another
question
by
a
hesitant
powerbook
purchaser
i
want
to
be
able
to
run
mathematica
and
would
like
to
hear
some
comments
from
the
gallery
about
this
how
much
slower
does
the
program
run
on
a
machine
without
an
fpu
namely
a
pb
versus
a
machine
with
an
fpu
namely
a
pb
what
types
of
calculations
get
bogged
down
the
most
i
primarily
due
moderately
simple
algebra
integrals
which
can
be
dealt
with
analytically
and
plotting
including
d
plots
i
dont
do
a
lot
of
numerical
work
would
a
pb
with
a
lot
of
memory
and
the
very
nice
video
port
be
sufficient
or
should
i
really
try
to
get
an
fpu
for
this
type
of
work
is
a
pb
with
mb
faster
than
a
pb
with
or
mb
all
comments
appreciated
please
respond
