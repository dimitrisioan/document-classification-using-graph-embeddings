math
coprocessor
option
my
purchasing
agent
told
me
about
the
math
coprocessor
option
and
sent
me
the
apple
summary
documentation
to
prove
it
i
ordered
the
coprocessor
option
but
im
really
not
sure
that
we
needed
it
i
thought
the
chip
had
a
math
coprocessor
built
into
it
has
apple
had
a
math
coprocessor
chip
architectured
to
keep
up
with
the
speed
of
the
chip
in
the
centris
i
am
concerned
that
i
may
have
set
up
a
hardware
bottleneck
please

your
responses
to

will
summarize
if
there
is
enough
interest
