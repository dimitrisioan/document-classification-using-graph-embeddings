disappearing
hard
drive
in
lc
the
internal
hd
in
my
lc
disappeared
for
a
day
last
week
and
id
like
to
hear
any
reasonable
theories
folks
can
suggest
for
what
happened
it
is
an
lc
with
mb
of
ram
and
an
mb
internal
drive
running
system
with
a
few
scsi
devices
in
a
so
far
as
i
know
properly
terminated
chain
i
had
shut
down
the
system
for
a
day
i
was
out
of
town
and
we
sometimes
have
thunderstorms
this
time
of
year
and
upon
restarting
got
a
blinking
question
mark
i
booted
from
a
floppy
and
saw
that
my
external
hd
seemed
okay
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
internal
i
installed
a
system
folder
on
the
external
and
was
indeed
able
to
boot
from
it
i
tried
things
like
disk
first
aid
and
silverlining
to
inquire
about
the
internal
drive
they
either
could
not
find
it
or
got
errors
in
trying
to
talk
to
it
silverlining
claimed
it
was
a
connor
drive
but
it
is
a
quantum
well
id
backed
things
up
so
i
was
able
to
work
but
at
some
point
i
noticed
that
the
internal
had
reappeared
now
disk
first
aid
says
that
alls
well
etc
things
seem
to
be
fine
but
what
happened
was
this
a
warning
that
something
the
internal
hd
or
something
else
is
about
to
die
im
definitely
nervous
and
if
this
is
a
signal
that
the
internal
hd
is
sick
is
it
true
that
i
can
only
put
up
to
a
mb
drive
inside
an
lc
some
folks
have
claimed
theres
a
limitation
in
the
lc
othern
size
or
power
while
others
and
that
includes
lacie
over
the
phone
say
anything
that
fits
is
okay
thanks
for
answers
