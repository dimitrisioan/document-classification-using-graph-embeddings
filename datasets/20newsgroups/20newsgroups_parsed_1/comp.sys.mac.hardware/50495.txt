re
whats
this
thermal
recalibration
on
quantum
drives
in
article
writes
whether
the
drive
is
hooked
up
to
the
computer
or
not
the
lps
makes
a
disk
seek
noise
every
seconds
this
is
consistent
and
will
continue
as
lomg
as
the
drive
is
powered
up
even
if
i
disconnect
the
drive
from
the
computer
this
drive
activity
continues
at
second
intervals
someone
tried
to
tell
me
the
drive
was
doing
a
thermal
recalibration
not
knowing
beans
about
the
internal
physical
workings
of
the
lastest
disk
drive
technology
i
guess
i
might
believe
anything
whats
the
scoop
on
this
standalone
drive
activity
every
sec
i
can
only
comment
on
thermal
recalibration
in
general
some
new
drives
perform
it
in
order
to
increase
overall
integrity
of
data
writes
basically
the
firmware
instructs
the
actuator
to
perform
a
test
to
see
if
the
data
tracks
are
within
a
certain
physical
tolerance
since
when
the
media
heats
up
or
cools
down
some
track
drift
is
inevitable
and
the
drive
has
to
monitor
it
this
becomes
especially
critical
at
very
high
recording
densities
and
so
was
used
primarily
on
very
largecapacity
mechanisms
but
it
seems
to
be
finding
its
way
into
more
smaller
drives
as
a
way
of
boosting
the
drives
longterm
reliability
and
mtbf
ratings
i
first
became
aware
of
thermal
recalibration
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
technique
conflicts
with
prolonged
write
times
when
digitizing
say
audio
or
video
to
hard
disk
some
manufacturers
explicitly
state
that
drives
with
thermal
recalibration
are
not
to
be
used
for
applications
that
have
prolonged
disk
writes
hope
this
helps
