performa
lciii
with
monitor
modem
and
software
do
we
detect
a
trend
here
people
the
performas
are
made
to
be
lowcost
business
solutions
the
xx
have
bundled
software
modems
etc
the
performas
are
made
to
be
lowcost
widely
distributed
sold
at
sears
home
machines
not
business
machines
they
were
developed
to
compete
with
the
retail
outlet
home
computer
market
because
they
have
no
retail
price
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
steeper
discount
on
them
shop
around
sears
is
probably
going
to
have
the
best
price
around
most
of
the
time
based
on
the
number
they
can
purchase
and
stuff
like
that
as
far
as
the
monitors
go
buy
rd
party
much
cheaper
not
really
the
newer
peformas
come
with
what
is
really
a
third
party
monitor
that
apple
has
put
their
name
on
and
called
it
the
performa
plus
display
essentially
it
is
a
vga
monitor
quite
cheap
