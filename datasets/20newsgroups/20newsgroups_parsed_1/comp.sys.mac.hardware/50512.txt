it
seems
to
me
that
reconditioned
hardware
should
be
sold
as
reconditioned
at
a
discounted
price
and
that
replacements
for
new
hardware
gone
bad
still
covered
under
a
day
warranty
should
be
new
well
sounds
like
we
need
some
kind
of
a
lemon
law
on
the
hardware
industry
after
all
it
does
sound
unfair
to
me
for
someone
that
has
paid
the
price
of
a
new
drive
for
a
reconditioned
one
what
do
you
guys
think
