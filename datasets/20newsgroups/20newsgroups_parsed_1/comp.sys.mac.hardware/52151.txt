in
this
particular
case
i
see
no
reason
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
romswapping
the
apple
bit
enabler
has
problems
but
mode
works
just
fine
with
and
still
im
not
aware
of
any
technical
reason
for
upgrading
the
rom
in
a
iix
other
than
getting
a
bit
clean
rom
what
other
features
would
a
iici
rom
in
a
iix
provide
if
any
there
is
probably
a
market
for
used
mother
boards
as
well
so
they
might
sell
a
rom
anyway
shreve
sells
them
for
about
i
cant
justify
this
for
bit
cleanliness
when
mode
works
