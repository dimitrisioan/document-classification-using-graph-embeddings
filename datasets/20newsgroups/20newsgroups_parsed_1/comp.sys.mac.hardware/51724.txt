are
simms
bad
mail
order
hi
everyone
just
the
other
day
i
ordered
a
vram
chip
for
my
new
lciii
from
mac
connection
they
sent
it
overnight
very
nice
and
i
got
it
installed
and
we
found
that
it
didnt
work
properly
when
you
put
the
computer
in
thousands
mode
the
bottom
of
the
screen
using
the
new
chip
is
all
flickering
and
fuzzy
so
i
called
them
up
and
im
going
to
return
it
for
a
new
one
my
question
is
how
often
does
such
a
thing
happen
with
simm
chips
in
general
do
you
often
find
when
ordering
chips
that
a
large
portion
are
bad
is
this
a
rarity
this
is
the
first
chip
ive
ordered
so
i
have
no
other
experience
in
this
area
im
just
curious
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
type
of
experience
thats
about
it
