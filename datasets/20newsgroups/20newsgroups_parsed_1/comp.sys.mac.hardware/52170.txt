besides
the
faster
processor
the
has
scsi
and
as
far
as
i
know
faster
io
due
to
separate
processors
handling
those
functions
mostly
the
q
does
have
a
scsi
controller
chip
as
its
scsi
chip
but
it
does
not
have
the
chips
to
use
the
wide
or
fast
scsi
modes
and
therefore
doesnt
offer
much
more
in
the
way
of
scsi
performance
over
the
q
it
does
howrever
have
a
faster
io
controller
than
the
q
this
is
where
the
real
speed
boost
comes
from
