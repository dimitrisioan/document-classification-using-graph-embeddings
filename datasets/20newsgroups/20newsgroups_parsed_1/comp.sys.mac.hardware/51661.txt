i
would
like
to
buy
a
bit
adc
card
for
the
mac
ii
with
digitization
rate
of
at
least
khz
preferably
khz
i
would
prefer
one
with
good
differential
and
integral
linearity
and
dma
would
be
a
plus
other
than
national
instruments
do
you
know
of
any
other
vendor
who
sells
such
a
card
instrutech
corp
has
a
nice
looking
bit
ad
and
da
board
that
can
run
at
the
speeds
you
want
the
itc
doesnt
have
dma
but
it
does
have
a
good
sized
fifo
that
can
buffer
your
samples
instrutech
can
be
reached
at
or
fax
i
dont
know
about
the
instrutech
boards
though
i
plan
to
check
them
out
but
you
need
to
be
very
careful
checking
the
monotonicity
and
sn
ratio
of
many
of
the
bit
boards
out
there
the
ni
boards
are
very
clearly
specified
in
terms
of
monotonicity
sn
ratio
accuracy
etc
and
the
nba
and
nba
have
all
the
dyynamic
range
and
freedom
from
distortion
that
youd
expect
from
a
good
true
bit
converter
this
is
not
true
for
the
spectral
innovations
boards
for
example
