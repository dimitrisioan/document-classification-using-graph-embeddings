re
centris
video
problem
im
having
it
also
when
the
computer
is
set
for
colors
and
certain
operations
are
done
particularly
vertical
scrolling
through
a
window
horizontal
white
lines
appear
on
the
monitor
which
generally
but
not
always
spare
open
windows
these
lines
accummulate
as
the
operation
is
continued
if
a
window
is
moved
over
the
involved
area
of
the
screen
and
then
moved
away
the
line
disappear
from
that
area
of
the
screen
this
problem
is
not
observed
if
the
monitor
is
configured
for
colors
or
a
inch
apple
monitor
with
colors
is
used
i
suspect
a
bad
video
ram
chip
but
can
not
be
certain
the
problem
has
been
apparent
since
day
but
has
gotten
worse
im
having
exactly
the
same
problem
again
its
fine
when
i
switch
to
colors
or
a
smaller
monitor
my
configuration
is
model
centris
with
mb
hd
vram
no
cards
monitor
mag
mxf
with
monitor
adaptor
for
resolution
of
i
just
discovered
the
problem
a
little
while
ago
after
plugging
in
my
new
mag
monitor
it
seems
to
appear
either
when
scrolling
through
a
window
or
when
using
alpha
or
word
and
i
enter
return
my
guess
is
bad
vrams
as
well
i
really
hope
it
isnt
a
design
flaw
is
