i
think
the
subject
title
says
it
all
anybody
that
relies
on
a
scsi
dick
for
stoarage
is
a
pain
in
the
ass
saying
things
like
that
incline
one
to
believe
that
you
cant
get
it
scsi
to
work
for
your
setup
too
bad
ive
daisychained
scsi
devices
off
my
mac
without
a
problem
limit
is
scsi
devices
in
the
daisychain
if
it
isnt
working
for
you
its
really
better
to
state
the
problem
unless
all
you
really
intend
to
do
is
try
to
get
nasty
email
in
that
case
perhaps
you
would
be
better
off
posting
