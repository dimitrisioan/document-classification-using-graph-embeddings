to
fix
trackball
the
trackbal
on
my
pb
no
longer
moves
in
the
horizontal
direction
when
i
called
the
nearest
authorized
apple
service
person
i
was
told
that
it
probably
needed
replacing
and
that
would
cost
me
over
ouch
can
anyone
recommend
a
less
expensive
way
to
fix
this
problem
one
strange
symptom
of
the
problem
is
that
when
i
take
the
ball
out
of
the
socket
and
shine
a
light
into
the
hole
i
can
make
the
cursor
move
horizontally
by
moving
the
wheel
with
my
finger
it
works
fine
that
way
but
wont
work
if
i
turn
off
the
light
any
suggestions
or
comments
