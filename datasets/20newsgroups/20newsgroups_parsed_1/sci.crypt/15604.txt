seems
like
sombody
didnt
like
your
snooping
around
marc
or
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
marc
is
spoofing
i
sincerely
doubt
that
denning
and
crew
are
keen
enough
to
react
that
quickly
and
i
doubt
theyd
want
to
cripple
their
smtp
server
tboot
marc
is
not
spoofing
try
it
yourself
at
least
the
commands
work
exactly
as
he
described
ie
they
do
not
work
josh
no
pattern
content
or
thing
is
the
being
who
looks
out
from
each
pair
of
eyes

important
