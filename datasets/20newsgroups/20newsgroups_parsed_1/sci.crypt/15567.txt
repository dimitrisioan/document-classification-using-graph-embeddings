im
attempting
to
write
a
serious
policy
paper
examining
whether
the
proposed
wiretap
or
clipper
chip
is
a
costeffective
tool
for
police
investigation
that
is
ignoring
concerns
about
government
intrusions
into
individual
privacy
is
the
value
of
easy
wiretaps
to
investigators
greater
than
the
cost
to
the
communications
industry
and
their
customers
to
support
this
wiretap
technology
first
what
the
fuck
is
nasa
doing
wasting
my
tax
dollars
doing
policy
papers
on
stuff
far
outside
of
their
purvewmission
do
us
a
favor
resign
rather
than
right
this
paper
for
nasa
go
do
useful
work
for
the
society
whew
take
it
easy
on
the
guy
maybe
hes
going
to
do
this
in
his
spare
time
maybe
hes
going
to
do
this
to
see
how
much
a
wiretap
really
costs
maybe
hes
going
to
do
this
so
he
can
add
to
the
opposition
to
clipper
i
dont
know
fully
why
he
might
do
this
but
maybe
we
shouldnt
start
flaming
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
