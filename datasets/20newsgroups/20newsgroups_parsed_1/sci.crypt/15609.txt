skipjack
has

we
dont
yet
know
if
all
bits
count
that
doesnt
worry
me
at
all
theyre
not
going
to
cheat
at
something
they
can
get
caught
at
and
key
size
is
one
of
the
things
that
can
be
verified
externally
feed
lots
of
random
keyinput
pairs
into
the
chip
then
try
flipping
random
key
bits
and
see
what
happens
to
the
output
we
already
know
what
should
happen
about
half
the
output
bits
should
vary
on
average
from
a
bit
key
change
or
input
change
if
they
were
out
to
build
a
weak
cryptosystem
it
might
be
the
case
that
some
of
the
bits
are
much
less
powerful
than
others
in
the
sense
that
they
only
enter
into
the
encryption
very
late
in
the
game
by
contrast
des
was
designed
to
use
each
key
bit
as
early
as
possible
the
output
change
rate
appears
as
early
as
round
again
though
i
dont
think
nsa
is
going
to
cheat
that
crudely
theyre
likely
to
get
caught
remember
that
theyve
promised
to
let
a
committee
of
outside
experts
see
the
cryptosystem
design
if
you
assume
something
deslike
a
biased
subkey
generation
schedule
will
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
the
committee
can
and
should
run
lots
of
tests
and
retain
the
output
this
can
be
verified
later
against
the
chip
and
yes
the
civilian
community
has
at
least
some
secure
storage
facilities
that
i
dont
think
even
nsa
can
get
into
without
it
being
noticed
until
fort
meade
gets
its
transporter
working
again
oops
i
dont
think
i
was
supposed
to
talk
about
that
the
committee
members
can
even
retain
secure
copies
of
the
code
in
two
halves
which
you
have
to
xor
together
to
recover
the
program
seriously
there
are
i
think
problems
with
this
whole
scheme
but
the
people
who
invented
it
arent
stupid
and
theyve
been
in
the
crypto
game
and
the
smokeandmirrors
game
far
longer
than
most
of
us
theyre
not
going
to
lie
in
ways
that
can
be
detected
easily
since
their
credibility
is
the
only
thing
they
can
use
to
sell
this
system
if
theyve
lied
about
the
civilian
committee
no
one
will
believe
them
about
the
absence
of
other
back
doors
if
theyve
lied
about
the
key
size
no
one
will
believe
that
they
havent
copied
the
programming
disk
with
the
u
keys
if
theyve
lied
about
obvious
aspects
of
the
strength
of
the
cryptosystem
no
one
will
believe
the
escrow
agencies
arent
in
cahoots
with
them
that
isnt
to
say
that
they
arent
lying
about
all
those
other
things
anyway
and
im
certainly
not
claiming
that
nsa
cant
build
a
cryptosystem
with
a
back
door
that
the
committee
cant
find
look
how
long
it
took
for
folks
to
believe
that
the
sboxes
werent
sabotaged
its
entirely
possible
that
the
committee
will
release
an
ambiguous
report
for
just
such
reasons
but
thats
a
subtle
point
ie
one
you
cant
explain
to
a
senator
anyway
its
looking
like
the
keys
and
escrow
arrangements
are
smoke
and
mirrors
to
cover
the
way
the
nsa
can
regenerate
the
key
from
the
transmitted
serial
number
i
dont
like
the
unit
key
generation
process
any
better
than
you
do
however
s
and
s
are
supposed
to
be
under
control
of
the
same
escrow
agents
if
they
cant
be
trusted
to
keep
the
seed
values
secure
they
cant
be
trusted
to
keep
the
halfkeys
secure
i
still
dont
know
if
or
when
s
and
s
change
i
thought
i
had
seen
something
about
them
being
constant
but
i
just
reread
dennings
technical
information
post
and
it
doesnt
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other
