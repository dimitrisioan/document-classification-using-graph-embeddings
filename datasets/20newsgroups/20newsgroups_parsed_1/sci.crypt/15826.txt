can

someone
in
canada
asked
me
to
send
him
some
public
domain
des
file
encryption
code
i
have
is
it
legal
for
me
to
send
it
i
believe
its
legal
to
send
des
code
or
equipment
from
the
us
to
canada
with
no
export
license
i
think
this
is
the
only
place
you
can
do
this
all
other
countries
require
a
license
as
an
aside
ive
always
thought
it
should
be
legal
to
send
des
software
anywhere
if
you
follow
these
rules
encrypt
your
des
software
with
des
send
the
encrypted
software
to
the
recipient
send
the
key
to
the
recipient
the
only
way
the
person
on
the
other
end
can
use
your
des
software
is
if
heshe
already
has
des
available
otherwise
they
cant
decrypt
your
program
and
it
is
useless
if
youve
guaranteed
they
already
have
des
have
you
really
violated
any
law
by
sending
it
to
them
in
the
form
of
your
program
im
sure
its
still
illegal
but
it
seems
like
a
good
idea
