you
could
just
as
well
use
a
character
password
to
perform
the
encryption
of
the
zero
bits
one
simple
method
would
be
to
use
the
first
characters
to
encrypt
the
zero
bits
and
then
use
the
remaining
characters
to
encrypt
the
result
again
the
output
would
still
be
bits
which
encodes
into
ascii
characters
wouldnt
this
method
be
vulnerable
against
a
birthday
attack
currently
a
cracker
needs
to
find
the
only
key
that
produces
the
given
ciphertext
he
has
to
try
about
keys
on
the
average
in
the
proposed
method
the
cracker
only
needs
any
pair
of
key
halves
if
he
can
store
about
guesses
for
one
half
he
is
likely
to
find
a
mathching
pair
in
about
guesses
here
i
have
assumed
that
the
desencryption
is
reversable
if
the
key
is
guessed
is
this
so
or
do
the
modifications
of
the
sboxes
by
the
salt
bits
make
it
nonreversable
probably
there
is
only
one
key
i
think
there
is
chance
in
about
that
there
are
two
or
more
keys
can
anyone
verify
this
but
this
doesnt
help
the
cracker
much
