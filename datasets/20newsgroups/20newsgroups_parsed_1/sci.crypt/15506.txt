re
is
there
any
security
in
the
clipper
in
article
zeev

writes
it
seems
to
me
that
all
discussions
about
clipper
security
are
almost
irrelevant
if
i
can
not
choose
the
key
but
have
to
use
a
key
chosen
for
me
by
the
foundry
the
security
of
the
whole
universe
of
users
is
as
good
or
as
bad
as
the
security
of
vlsi
technologies
inc
or
their
handlers
it
is
a
trivial
effort
to
run
any
ciphertext
agains
all
the
keys
ever
manufactured
after
all
we
are
talking
about
to
million
keys
that
will
ever
be
manufactured
the
key
depositories
can
be
as
secure
and
incorruptible
as
they
wish
to
be
nobody
cares
anyway
they
key
depositories
are
irrelevant
in
order
for
the
applicable
law
enformcement
agencies
to
be
able
to
know
what
keys
to
request
from
escrow
the
system
will
have
to
squawk
its
serial
number
in
clear
text
as
part
of
the
link
establishment
protocol
whoever
owns
the
program
that
assigns
keys
to
each
serial
number
wont
need
access
to
the
key
depository
in
other
words
the
fbi
may
need
a
courtordered
release
of
escrowed
keys
but
the
nsa
has
the
keys
before
the
chip
is
ever
manufactured
there
is
no
need
to
go
through
the
escrow
or
to
try
all
keys
while
relations
between
law
enforment
agencies
have
sometimes
been
strained
there
is
also
a
long
history
of
trading
favors
this
will
reestablish
the
nsa
as
a
very
important
agency
for
everyone
to
get
along
with
because
they
can
give
you
untraceable
encryption
leaks
without
court
orders
the
more
i
think
about
this
affair
the
fouler
it
smells
id
rather
have
