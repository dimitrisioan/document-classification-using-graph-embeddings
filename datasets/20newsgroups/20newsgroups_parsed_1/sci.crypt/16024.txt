clipper
also
allows
an
extraordinary
opportunity
for
the
criminal
to
conceal
use
of
superencryption
an
automated
fullsystem
surveillance
mechanism
quite
feasible
across
radio
bandwidth
which
knows
family
key
f
can
validate
clipper
wrappers
and
nesn
associations
but
it
can
not
reveal
in
realtime
the
use
of
superencryption
unless
it
knows
all
unit
keys
which
we
are
being
assured
are
only
to
be
made
available
in
two
separate
pieces
upon
specific
wiretaplike
order
the
serial
number
will
be
in
a
bit
block
with
a
bit
filler
doesnt
take
a
lot
to
check
to
see
if
that
is
correct
depends
on
whether
the
filler
is
a
constant
makes
checking
easy
but
susceptible
to
replay
or
variable
eg
timer
counter
random
which
makes
replay
harder
and
can
also
make
it
easier
for
the
inquisitors
to
know
if
theyve
missed
messages
or
gotten
them
out
of
sequence
or
other
interesting
things
that
sort
of
person
might
care
about
it
is
still
easy
to
conceal
superencryption
at
least
until
the
inquisitors
get
ahold
of
the
k
key
which
can
take
a
while
presumably
not
in
nearrealtime
worstcase
in
which
the
escrow
agencies
provide
the
u
key
to
the
local
cops
still
only
gets
one
side
of
the
conversation
per
warrant
unless
the
same
key
is
used
for
both
directions
which
i
suppose
the
capstone
version
of
the
chip
will
probably
insist
on
pray
