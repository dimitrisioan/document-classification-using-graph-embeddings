do
a
straight
encryption
of
your
keyrings
and
put
the
results
with
misleading
names
somewhere
they
wont
be
noticed
eg
in
the
windows
directory
nobody
knows
what
half
those
files
are
do
a
straight
encryption
of
a
bat
file
that
will
decrypt
the
keyrings
to
ramdisk
and
will
set
pgppath
to
point
at
it
set
up
another
bat
file
to
decrypt
and
execute
the
first
again
on
ram
disk
have
it
take
the
name
of
the
target
file
as
an
argument
so
that
there
is
no
link
between
this
file
and
the
nonexistent
batch
file
referred
to
by
the
rest
of
the
system
comment
it
so
it
looks
like
a
test
script
for
fooling
around
with
pgp
set
pgppath
to
the
pgp
directory
leave
the
original
keyrings
that
came
with
pgp
in
the
directory
with
pgp
a
good
indication
that
you
are
playing
with
but
havent
made
serious
use
of
pgp
add
a
set
of
keys
with
your
name
and
a
really
simple
passphrase
never
use
it
or
use
it
as
your
widely
published
key
for
lowsecurity
email
when
needed
run
the
second
bat
file
make
sure
all
intermediate
and
plainfiles
are
generated
on
ramdisk
when
you
hear
the
concussion
grenade
hit
the
power
switch
