oh
i
see
your
point
i
think
youre
wrong
but
if
you
sit
back

wait

find

if
im
right
itll
be
too
late
just
listen
very

shoe

ive
been
a
very
intent
nren
spectator
of
the
nren
for
years
as
a
commercial
ip
software
vendor
it
really
is
my
professional
opinion
that
the
nren
at
this
point
is
irrelevant
to
private
sector
networking
if
it
had
been
deployed
five
years
ago
it
would
have
been
a
major
development
now
however
its
just
an
upgrade
to
the
nsfnet
and
an
attempt
to
revive
the
lagging
use
of
the
national
supercomputer
centers
you
could
cut
out
the
nsfnet
completely
and
the
internet
would
continue
chugging
along
without
a
hiccup

longhaul
networking
and
internet
connectivity
have
long
since
ceased
to
be
under
federal
sponsorship
or
regulation
at
least
in
the
usa
the
success
of
the
cix
commercial
internet
exchange
is
a
prime
example
of
this
while
our
dear
vp
has
been
promoting
his
data
superhighway
the
private
sector
has
been
building
it
without
the
