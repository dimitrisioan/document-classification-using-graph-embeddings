in
article
writes
and
since
the
us
constitutions
guarantees
the
right
to
every
american
to
bear
arms
why
is
not
every
american
entitled
as
a
matter
of
have
you
read
the
applicable
part
of
the
constitution
and
interpreted
it
in
context
if
not
please
do
so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individuals
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
hmmm
this
could
become
a
flame
war
very
quickly
the
text
is
well
regulated
militia
when
that
amendment
was
written
and
approved
regulated
meand
armed
remember
all
of
those
westerns
where
bounty
hunters
were
called
regulators
this
is
now
an
archaic
usage
of
the
word
but
the
original
intent
of
the
amendment
was
about
weapons
not
control
