i
heard
somewhere
cant
name
the
source
that
tempest
does
not
necessarily
pickup
just
crts
but
it
can
pick
up
emissions
from
almost
any
chip
if
that
is
true
the
kind
monitor
would
not
make
any
difference
becuase
everything
on
the
screen
can
be
pickedup
from
the
video
controller
can
anybody
verify
or
refute
this
anything
can
be
an
emissions
problem
right
down
to
the
video
cable
given
the
right
equipment
you
can
pick
the
screen
paint
from
the
cable
but
given
any
cable
you
must
know
what
is
being
sent
through
it
to
know
the
format
of
the
signal
as
well
as
how
many
wires
etc
