responding
to
claims
about
skipjack
cracking
engines
thousands
tens
of
thousands
do
some
arithmetic
please
skipjack
has
possible
keys
lets
assume
a
bruteforce
engine
like
that
hypothesized
for
des
microsecond
per
trial
million
chips
thats
trials
per
second
or
about
years
for
trials
well
maybe
they
can
get
chips
running
at
one
trial
per
nanosecond
and
build
a
machine
with
million
chips
sure
only
years
for
each
solution
i
think
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
mystical
des
engines
are
known
plaintext
engines
unless
you
add
a
ton
of
really
smart
hardware
the
plaintext
is
digitized
voice
and
exists
for
a
very
short
time
probably
in
a
couple
inches
of
copper
tops
its
flatly
not
available
your
bug
in
my
office
can
hear
my
voice
and
even
digitize
it
but
its
going
to
get
a
different
bitstream
it
is
horribly
naive
to
suppose
that
regular
folks
can
figure
out
how
to
crack
skipjack
or
clipper
based
telephones
im
certainly
not
devoting
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
it
