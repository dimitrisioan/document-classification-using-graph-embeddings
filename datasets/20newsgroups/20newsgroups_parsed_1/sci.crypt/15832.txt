ok
andrew
ill
provide
some
evidence
a
friend
of
mine
worked
for
an
electronics
manufacturer
on
with
a
westcoast
office
they
routinely
sold
equipment
to
the
japanese
one
day
the
japanese
started
showing
up
with
discount
demands
that
were
amazingly
close
to
the
cost
to
manufacture
the
products
this
company
routinely
sent
most
of
the
manufacturing
data
to
the
field
offices
the
japanese
had
simply
intercepted
it
so
my
friend
the
computer
systems
admin
came
up
with
a
solution
he
started
sending
the
data
out
doubleblockencrypted
with
des
two
days
after
this
new
distribution
plan
was
implemented
the
president
of
the
company
got
a
visit
from
a
pair
of
government
agents
they
told
him
to
knock
it
off
the
president
gave
in
since
his
company
did
a
considerable
business
with
the
federal
government
now
if
the
government
wasnt
monitoring
the
communications
how
would
they
even
know
that
the
encryption
system
was
installed
further
since
encryp
tion
isnt
illegal
and
des
certainly
isnt
what
is
the
basis
of
the
governments
ceaseanddesist
demand
something
similar
has
happened
to
me
ages
ago
when
we
were
working
on
pgp
we
used
to
send
short
messages
about
development
issues
or
simply
to
test
new
features
around
now
at
this
time
pgp
and
certainly
the
newer
version
was
unknown
over
here
suddenly
the
admin
at
the
site
i
was
using
received
a
request
that
i
stop
sending
encrypted
email
now
there
is
almost
no
way
that
some
automatic
scanner
could
have
found
this
since
they
wouldnt
have
known
about
pgp
they
must
have
checked
for
unknown
data
types
in
the
message
tried
to
unscramble
it
found
they
couldnt
get
past
the
pem
armour
part
and
then
contacted
the
sysadmin
and
asked
me
to
stop
luckily
the
current
email
carriers
are
less
picky
about
what
goes
over
their
networks
in
case
people
think
email
scanning
doesnt
take
place
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
done
regularly
by
many
sites
usually
not
by
government
agencies
or
at
least
not
that
i
know
of
but
by
local
administrators
who
for
reasons
of
their
own
have
decided
to
monitor
all
communications
im
sure
you
can
all
think
of
a
whole
mess
of
reasons
stop
hackers
terroristschild
pornographersdrug
dealersevil
commieswhatever
there
have
been
several
occasions
when
ive
got
people
into
trouble
simply
by
including
the
traditional
nsa
bait
in
a
message
i
dont
try
it
any
more
now
a
friend
of
mine
was
once
picked
up
for
mentioning
the
name
of
the
uk
town
of
scunthorpe
hint
look
for
words
embedded
in
it
im
sure
there
are
many
more
examples
of
this
happening
in
fact
if
anyone
has
any
examples
id
appreciate
hearing
from
them
i
could
use
them
as
ammunition
during
talks
on
privacy
issues
peter
in
order
of
preference
one
of
ems
bound
to
work
dont
vote
youll
only
encourage
them
