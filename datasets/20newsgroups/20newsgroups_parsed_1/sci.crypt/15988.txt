id
really
like
to
see
such
a
thing
developed
so
that
interactive
internet
talk
radio
could
be
done
ideally
though
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
device
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
enough
device
that
nobody
should
be
able
to
balk
at
its
widespread
use
obviously
to
make
it
easy
for
homebrewers
it
should
use
pretty
common
hardware
i
suggest
we
start
with
the
ubiquitous
sun
to
get
a
lot
of
momentum
going
custom
hardware
isnt
going
to
go
anywhere
until
theres
a
user
base
anyone
interested
ill
start
a
provisional
mailing
list
let
me
know
if
you
want
on
count
me
in
i
need
someone
at
the
us
end
to
experiment
on
the
protocols
with
and
i
like
the
way
you
code
give
me
weeks
to
move
house
and
settle
in
then
well
go
for
it
seriously
