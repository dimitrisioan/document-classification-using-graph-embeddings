re
write
to
clinton
white
house
is
this
white
house
email
address
really
working
yet
someone
posted
such
an
address
on
compuserve
a
few
months
ago
but
apparently
the
white
house
wasnt
really
set
up
to
recive
hundreds
thousands
this
is
a
real
address
my
understanding
of
the
current
process
that
mail
takes
is
it
gets
downloaded
on
floppy
disk
and
is
processed
by
retiree
volunteers
who
match
the
message
against
message
profiles
and
check
the
message
count
ie
yeah
thats
a
for
gays
in
the
military
whats
this
clipper
stuff
must
be
against
gays
in
the
military
the
highervolume
whitehouse
email
stuff
is
in
the
works
i
know
for
a
fact
but
wont
be
online
for
probably
another
month
or
two
at
the
soonest
my
understanding
is
that
the
link
speed
will
increase
direct
internet
instead
of
compuerve
to
floppy
but
the
message
processing
will
remain
the
same
unless
the
people
at
the
white
house
print
and
distribute
this
mail
every
day
you
may
have
better
luck
printing
out
a
letter
on
paper
that
flat
white
stuff
all
over
my
desk
and
snailmailing
it
to
the
white
house
i
imagine
writing
to
your
local
representative
and
senator
wouldnt
hurt
either
heck
why
not
write
to
al
gore
while
youre
at
it
the
white
house
email
does
get
read
i
agree
that
printing
it
and
sending
cc
to
everyone
you
can
think
of
is
probably
better
because
it
is
more
visible
but
the
message
processing
fitting
messages
against
a
template
is
the
same
in
either
case
