the
only
thing
that
worries
me
is
that
compression
the
soundblaster
can
do
it
automatically
in
hardware
but
other
than
that
i
dont
have
a
good
feel
for
how
processor
intensive
it
is
so
i
cant
estimate
how
fast
a
pc
youd
need
theres
a
better
way
doesnt
qualcom
have
a
secure
design
that
it
decided
not
to
market
since
they
arent
going
to
use
it
wouldnt
the
patriotic
thing
be
to
put
the
design
in
the
public
domain
how
about
selling
a
cryptography
educational
kit
with
the
critical
parts
something
that
could
end
up
as
a
pc
option
board
with
two
phone
jacks
