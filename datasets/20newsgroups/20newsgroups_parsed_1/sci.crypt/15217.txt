in

clipper
chip
announcement
writes
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
etc
great
nice
choice
of
bad
guys
to
convince
everyone
how
bad
unrestricted
encryption
is
why
not
use
a
child
molester
instead
of
course
the
word
suspect
is
never
used
here
so
i
guess
these
people
have
already
been
convicted
and
are
operating
this
drug
ring
from
their
jail
cells
how
about
this
question
instead
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
political
opponent
of
a
senior
administration
official
and
intercepts
a
conversation
kinda
changes
your
interpretation
of
the
event
doesnt
it
and
yes
the
presence
of
the
clipper
chip
does
change
things
because
it
will
not
only
give
the
people
talking
on
the
phone
a
false
sense
of
security
it
will
also
give
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
the
justification
to
deny
use
of
strong
encryption
methods
that
are
inconvenient
to
them
dang
it
all
its
supposed
to
be
inconvenient
but
not
impossible
thats
the
only
sure
way
to
make
sure
that
abuses
are
minimized
while
still
allowing
legitimate
law
enforcement
access
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
uh
huh
sure
i
predict
that
within
two
months
weeks
of
the
chips
debut
the
full
technical
details
will
be
posted
to
scicrypt
and
if
this
has
any
impact
on
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
then
weve
been
lied
to
any
cryptosystem
worth
its
salt
can
withstand
the
light
of
public
scrutiny
and
there
is
no
way
you
can
be
sure
that
an
algorithm
has
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
unless
you
have
half
the
world
trying
to
break
it
for
a
decade
or
so
even
then
you
got
ta
be
careful
michael
t
palmer
a
man
is
crazy
who
writes
a
secret
in
any
other
way
than
one
which
will
conceal
it
ripem
key
on
server
from
the
vulgar
