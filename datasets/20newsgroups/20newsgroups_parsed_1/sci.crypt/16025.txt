conference
calls
its
not
clipper
its
any
encryption
system
ive
seen
a
number
of
designs
they
generally
involve
a
multiline
cleartext
bridge
a
multiline
cleartext
bridge
and
just
were
would
you
put
that
bridge
if
it
isnt
at
one
of
the
receiptants
location
forget
encryption
at
all
you
have
blown
any
security
you
thought
you
might
have
had
most
of
the
people
using
encrypted
conference
bridges
these
days
are
military
or
equivalent
like
cia
and
other
embassy
personnel
so
putting
bridges
on
the
recipients
location
is
normal
its
in
a
vault
on
a
military
base
or
ft
meade
and
the
secure
phones
are
in
soundproof
rooms
with
big
locks
on
the
doors
because
theyre
talking
about
classified
stuff
or
golf
with
other
generals
that
paradigm
will
change
as
we
start
using
encrypted
phones
in
our
offices
or
homes
to
carry
on
normal
conversations
about
dinner
plans
and
stock
purchases
and
meeting
schedules
and
technical
info
and
the
good
batch
of
illegal
frop
that
we
got
last
weekend
from
bob
most
people
dont
use
soundproof
vaults
and
may
use
bridges
in
their
pbx
or
from
the
local
phone
company
way
calls
or
long
distance
or
valueadded
phone
company
eg
alliance
conference
bridges
if
clipjack
is
mainly
used
for
the
radio
portion
of
cellular
phones
the
conferencing
aspects
dont
change
but
there
may
be
a
market
niche
for
trusted
conferencebridge
providers
though
i
suppose
the
inquisitors
would
try
to
get
a
blanket
wiretap
authorization
for
many
bridges
just
in
case
a
bad
guy
might
use
the
service
