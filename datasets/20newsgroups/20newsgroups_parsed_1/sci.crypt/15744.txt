re
off
the
shelf
cheap
des
keyseach
machine
was
re
corporate
acceptance
of
the
wiretap
chip
in
article
ag
russell
writes
at
the
company
i
worked
for
previously
i
received
a
file
that
was
des
encryped
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
weeks
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
only
took
two
days
to
crack
the
file
no
i
dont
have
any
faith
in
des
taking
this
at
face
value
though
it
seems
quite
dissonant
with
much
else
that
has
been
published
here
about
brute
force
des
cracking
unless
russell
was
lucky
with
respect
to
the
key
id
be
very
interested
in
whether
the
program
russell
used
is
available
in
whether
he
used
a
cleartext
recognition
algorithm
in
the
program
or
whether
he
had
to
examine
each
decryption
by
hand
in
whether
he
used
a
known
plaintext
attack
he
probably
should
also
tell
us
given
his
address
what
machine
he
useda
desktop
workstation
or
supercomputer
depending
on
his
answer
this
could
be
an
appalling
development
calling
into
question
both
des
and
rsades
dunno
about
rsaidea
if
any
bright
programmer
with
a
little
idle
machine
time
can
crack
a
single
des
message
in
a
couple
of
days
assuming
no
tricks
that
are
messagespecific
then
heres
my
clipper
key
nsa
give
me
the
chip
