the
secret
source
of
that
announcement
in
article
ef
writes
i
guess
the
cryptowranglers
read
this
group
too
but
of
course
i
knew
that
because
it
is
so
easy
to
do
there
is
not
a
single
doubt
in
my
mind
that
every
byte
that
passes
every
significant
gateway
or
bone
is
captured
for
the
colligation
of
data
about
maybe
your
name
is
here
i
really
like
these
claims
where
did
they
come
from
we
hear
practically
daily
that
the
nsa
monitors
oh
everything
they
can
crack
anything
theyd
never
release
a
cryptosystem
they
couldnt
crack
where
do
people
get
these
fascinating
facts
the
puzzle
palace
if
you
can
get
it
for
a
buck
nd
hand
it
must
be
true
eh
im
pretty
sure
the
nsa
is
supposed
to
among
many
other
things
provide
highquality
cryptosystems
to
a
variety
of
places
i
dont
recall
reading
anywhere
reliable
that
theyre
supposed
to
monitor
my
phonecalls
monitor
usenet
provide
only
cryptosystems
they
can
easily
crack
etc
etc
this
is
not
to
say
that
they
dont
they
might
but
you
dont
know
that
they
do
and
you
have
no
evidence
that
they
do
for
almost
all
values
of
you
it
follows
therefore
that
for
most
values
of
you
your
claims
about
the
nsa
border
on
paranoia
