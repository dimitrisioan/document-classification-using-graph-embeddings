re
text
of
white
house
announcement
and
qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
the
key
question
is
whether
nonclipper
encryption
will
be
made
illegal
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
the
clear
middle
ground
implied
by
these
statements
is
to
say
that
americans
have
the
right
to
clipper
encryption
but
not
to
unbreakable
encryption
this
implies
that
ultimately
nonclipper
strong
encryption
must
become
illegal
as
an
aside
isnt
the
language
here
jarring
all
this
talk
about
harmonious
balance
when
theyre
talking
about
taking
away
peoples
right
to
communications
privacy
although
the
article
emphasizes
voice
communication
data
and
mail
encryption
is
mentioned
as
well
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
it
looks
like
the
worst
nightmares
raised
by
dorothy
dennings
proposals
are
coming
true
if
the
government
continues
on
this
course
i
imagine
that
we
will
see
strong
cryptography
made
illegal
encryption
programs
for
disk
files
and
email
as
well
as
software
to
allow
for
encrypted
voice
communications
will
be
distributed
only
through
the
underground
people
will
have
to
learn
how
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
are
protecting
their
privacy
its
shocking
and
frightening
to
see
that
this
is
actually
happening
