writes
what
follows
is
my
opinion
it
is
not
asserted
to
be
the
truth
so
no
flames
please
it
is
incompetent
like
almost
anything
you
have
posted
here
so
youll
be
flamed
sorry
it
comes
out
of
a
background
of
years
as
a
senior
corporate
staff
executive
in
two
fortune
companies
your
years
of
background
in
two
fortune
companies
ive
lived
years
under
a
totalitarian
regime
and
boy
i
can
recognize
a
totalitarian
plot
when
i
see
one
id
be
happy
to
use
a
crypto
system
supplied
by
the
nsa
for
business
if
they
told
me
it
was
more
secure
than
des
and
in
particular
resistant
to
i
am
sure
that
you
would
be
happy
to
use
anything
they
tell
you
is
secure
were
talking
about
the
intelligent
people
here
or
the
criminal
ones
if
you
dont
like
the
previous
sentence
or
those
who
dont
want
their
privacy
to
be
guaranteed
to
be
invadable
by
the
government
any
current
and
future
government
mind
you
id
be
happy
to
do
so
even
with
escrowed
keys
provided
i
was
happy
about
the
bona
fides
of
the
escrow
agencies
the
federal
reserve
would
certainly
satisfy
me
as
would
something
set
up
by
one
of
the
big
accounting
firms
even
if
you
ignore
the
nonsense
of
the
above
statement
for
a
moment
and
even
if
you
are
happy
with
such
system
and
the
current
escrow
agencies
now
what
guarantees
that
youll
be
happy
with
them
tomorrow
when
the
government
changes
or
when
the
current
government
throws
away
the
sheep
skin
all
the
sheep
who
are
reasoning
like
you
will
get
caught
by
surprise
but
it
will
be
too
late
because
then
cryptography
that
is
not
guaranteed
to
be
breakable
by
the
government
will
already
have
been
outlawed
after
all
youve
already
got
privacy
that
is
said
to
be
breakable
only
by
the
law
enforcement
agencies
so
if
you
are
lawabiding
you
have
no
reasons
to
use
a
stronger
one
right
so
if
you
are
using
a
stronger
one
you
have
something
to
hide
from
the
law
enforcement
agencies
right
something
unlawful
right
therefore
strong
crypto
is
a
clear
idndication
that
you
are
doing
something
unlawful
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
president
if
they
stated
there
were
no
trap
considering
the
level
of
competence
in
cryptology
that
you
have
demonstrated
in
your
messages
you
would
trust
just
anything
and
no
this
is
not
an
ad
hominem
attack
its
an
attack
against
the
contents
of
your
messages
grin
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committee
of
independent
experts
examined
the
thing
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
reported
back
that
it
was
secure
and
how
do
you
know
that
these
experts
are
not
corrupted
and
how
do
you
know
that
they
will
not
make
a
mistake
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
version
of
the
algorithm
they
will
be
let
to
examine
is
the
same
as
the
one
that
will
be
really
used
regarding
the
mistake
even
the
few
information
they
have
let
out
has
revealed
a
serious
security
hole
in
the
protocol
the
bit
key
is
split
in
two
bit
ones
thus
the
whole
system
is
easily
breakable
if
you
have
only
one
of
the
keys
id
trust
something
from
the
nsa
long
before
id
trust
something
from
some
swiss
or
anybody
japanese
the
swiss
or
the
japanese
are
motivated
by
simple
greed
nsa
is
motivated
by
their
wish
to
control
the
people
thats
why
the
drug
dealers
have
their
accounts
in
swiss
banks
instead
of
in
american
ones
for
some
reason
they
do
trust
the
swiss
banks
more
guess
theyll
trust
the
swiss
encryption
more
too
i
see
idea
becoming
suddenly
popular
this
may
seem
surprising
to
some
here
but
i
suggest
most
corporations
would
feel
the
same
way
mostmanysome
pick
one
corporations
have
an
attitude
that
the
nsa
is
part
of
our
government
and
we
support
our
government
as
one
very
famous
ceo
put
it
to
me
one
day
its
not
surprising
at
all
but
not
because
of
the
reason
you
give
its
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
us
government
has
put
a
lot
of
money
behind
this
program
and
it
will
support
it
thus
most
corporations
will
try
to
get
their
piece
from
the
pie
by
supporting
it
too
the
same
good
old
greed
strong
encryption
is
not
widely
available
now
not
because
of
some
plot
but
because
the
companies
dont
see
much
money
in
it
it
will
be
available
even
less
if
the
companies
can
see
any
penalties
associated
with
it
just
some
perspective
from
another
point
of
view
yeah
just
as
i
predicted
you
are
here
again
to
support
the
new
system
