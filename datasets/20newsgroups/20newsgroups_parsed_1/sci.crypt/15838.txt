advances
in
digital
computing
have
made
it
possible
for
ordinary
people
to
use
powerful
machine
cipher
techniques
it
is
tempting
albeit
chauvinistic
to
believe
that
we
have
a
new
situation
here
thanks
to
our
pet
computers
this
is
not
true
david

a
history
of
cryptography
makes
two
things
obvious
cryptography
is
a
spontaneous
invention
of
private
human
individuals
and
has
been
going
on
for
thousands
of
years
teenage
slang
and
cipher
inventions
provide
a
modern
example
of
this
spontaneous
creation
the
systems
people
created
on
their
own
were
roughly
as
secure
as
and
sometimes
more
secure
than
those
used
by
military
and
diplomatic
users
of
that
time
although
they
seem
very
simple
and
insecure
today
eg
in
places
the
bible
used
a
more
complex
simple
substitution
than
caesar
did
for
his
military
dispatches
but
before
caesar

book

all
