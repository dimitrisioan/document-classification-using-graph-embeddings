text
of
white
house
announcement
and
qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
in
article
writes
robert
ward
writes
and
since
the
us
constitutions
guarantees
the
right
to
every
american
to
bear
arms
why
is
not
every
american
entitled
as
a
matter
of
have
you
read
the
applicable
part
of
the
constitution
and
interpreted
it
in
context
yes
btw
the
appropriate
amendments
were
posted
here
some
time
ago
if
not
please
do
so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individual
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
its
ok
its
ok
just
a
month
ago
i
expressed
my
belief
that
the
right
to
have
a
means
to
shoot
your
neighbor
is
not
that
much
necessary
to
ensure
a
peoples
right
to
be
free
and
got
flamed
by
lots
of
american
gun
supporters
so
i
thought
that
never
mind
the
new
cripple
chip
is
a
purely
american
problem
so
deal
with
the
mess
yourselves
i
just
wanted
to
share
with
you
a
bit
of
my
experience
of
living
years
under
a
totalitarian
regime
im
bulgarian
because
i
thought
that
it
might
be
useful
to
you
oh
well
i
think
your
experiences
under
the
bulgarian
regime
are
highly
relevant
we
have
too
many
people
with
their
heads
in
the
sand
saying
it
can
not
happen
here
as
our
constitutional
rights
are
being
trashed
every
day
because
the
government
justifies
doing
some
endrun
around
the
protections
by
a
crisis
requiring
drastic
action
it
is
most
likely
that
in
the
future
possession
of
secure
encryption
tools
will
be
regarded
as
possession
of
terrorist
and
drug
dealers
tools
and
be
some
serious
fedaral
felony
just
like
common
tools
are
burgular
tools
if
the
police
say
so
common
computer
programs
even
computers
themselves
are
now
hackers
tools
and
will
become
terrorist
tools
bet
on
it
the
insights
of
someone
who
has
lived
throught
this
are
very
important
if
the
us
goes
the
way
of
the
old
soviet
union
and
its
client
states
as
far
as
individual
rights
privacy
and
overall
freedom
are
concerned
the
rest
of
the
world
remember
new
world
order
will
not
be
far
behind
only
a
few
years
please
keep
posting
anything
you
find
that
is
deficient
or
that
threatens
ones
rights
in
this
thing
for
example
a
conversation
between
a
suspect
and
a
lawyer
will
no
longer
be
private
from
big
brother
eavesdropping
political
dissent
allready
is
very
dangerous
in
this
country
all
it
takes
is
the
government
to
decide
that
enough
people
will
take
one
seriously
then
one
becomes
guilty
of
plotting
to
overthrow
the
government
by
illegal
means
the
phrase
illegal
means
is
defined
as
whatever
the
government
wants
it
to
be
defined
as
couple
this
with
clintons
pressing
for
a
smart
national
id
card
an
internal
passport
with
the
added
wrinkle
that
anything
about
you
and
your
past
can
be
put
on
it
and
you
can
only
take
the
governments
word
as
to
what
is
really
on
it
since
they
will
be
the
only
ones
with
the
means
to
completely
read
and
reprogram
the
thing
isnt
that
nice
while
the
feds
can
bust
into
ones
safe
without
the
keys
the
owner
knows
his
safe
has
been
broken
into
when
they
break
into
your
secure
phone
conversations
or
other
storedtransmitted
data
in
the
near
future
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
so
accountability
as
to
the
legalities
has
gone
out
the
window
just
like
a
safe
if
they
have
a
legal
cause
they
can
get
the
keys
from
the
suspect
just
like
they
can
get
the
keys
to
a
safe
or
the
combination
from
the
suspect
same
with
encryption
record
everything
get
the
warrants
then
decode
it
with
the
keys
obtained
from
the
suspect
this
clinton
cripple
along
with
its
natural
extensions
will
make
any
priviliged
communications
between
client
and
lawyer
and
any
meaningful
political
dissent
virtually
impossible
which
is
the
general
idea
any
propeganda
about
its
being
secure
and
the
safeguards
and
all
of
that
are
just
that
propeganda
to
reassure
people
so
they
will
by
into
this
monstrosity
dont
be
suckered

brother
