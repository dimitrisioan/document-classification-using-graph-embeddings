declassifying
media
there
are
many
urban
legends
maybe
this
ought
to
be
in
the
crypt
faq
about
what
is
actually
sufficient
to
clear
or
declassify
magnetic
media
when
used
for
classified
data
here
is
some
information
from
the
horses
mouth
regarding
the
sufficient
overwriting
of
media
clearing
meant
to
be
retained
within
the
controlled
environment
or
declassifying
the
material
to
be
reused
outside
the
controlled
environment

clearing
of
magnetic
media
certain
types
of
removable
media
eg
magnetic
tape
floppy
disk
cassettes
and
magnetic
cards
may
be
cleared
by
overwriting
the
entire
media
one
time
with
any
one
character
floppy
disks
may
be
cleared
by
applying
a
vendors
formatting
program
that
overwrites
each
location
with
a
given
character
fixed
media
eg
winchester
disks
should
be
cleared
by
overwriting
at
least
one
time
with
any
one
character
one
way
to
do
this
is
by
applying
a
vendorsupplied
formatting
program
that
overwrites
each
location
on
the
disk
with
a
given
character
if
it
can
be
shown
that
this
program
actually
works
as
advertised
the
user
should
beware
some
programs
that
purport
to
overwrite
all
locations
do
not
actually
do
this
cleared
media
may
be
resides
within
the
controlled
facility
or
released
for
destruction
however
they
should
be
marked
and
controlled
at
the
level
of
the
most
restrictive
sensitivity
of
information
ever
recorded
declassification
of
magnetic
media
certain
types
of
removable
media
can
be
declassified
using
a
degaussing
device
that
has
been
approved
for
declassifying
media
of
that
type
a
list
of
approved
devices
is
maintained
by
the
nsa
if
a
fixed
medium
for
example
a
hard
or
winchester
disk
is
operative
an
approved
method
of
declassifying
the
disk
pack
is
to
employ
an
overwrite
procedure
which
must
overwrite
all
addressable
locations
at
least
three
times
by
writing
any
character
then
its
complement
eg
binary
ones
and
binary
zeros
alternatively
when
fixed
media
become
inoperative
it
is
impossible
to
declassify
the
media
by
the
overwrite
method
in
this
case
there
are
two
alternate
procedures
that
may
be
used
disassemble
the
disk
pack
and
degauss
each
platter
with
the
appropriate
approved
degaussing
equipment
and
courier
the
inoperative
media
to
the
vendors
facility
have
the
magnetic
media
eg
disk
platter
removed
in
sight
of
the
courier
and
returned
to
the
courier
for
destruction
at
the
secure
site
the
vendor
can
then
install
new
platters
and
repair
any
other
problems
with
the

unit
