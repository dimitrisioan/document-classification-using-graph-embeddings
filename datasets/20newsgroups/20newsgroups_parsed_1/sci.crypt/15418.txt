how
can
you
reconcile
the
administrations
self
proclaimed
purpose
of
providing
law
enforcement
with
access
to
encrypted
data
without
making
the
clipper
system
the
only
crypto
available
in
the
us
the
second
and
fourth
amendments
do
come
to
mind
i
think
i
heard
someplace
misclegal
comporgefftalk
that
the
courts
have
pretty
much
eliminated
the
fourth
amendment
already
words
got
me
the
wound
and
will
get
me
well
my
opinions
are
my
own
if
you
believe
