timothy
c
may
writes
but
is
it
any
worse
than
the
current
unsecure
system
it
becomes
much
worse
of
course
if
the
government
then
uses
this
clinton
clipper
to
argue
for
restrictions
on
unapproved
encryption
this
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
us
i
think
the
camels
nose
in
the
tent
etc
i
agree
this
is
the
danger
i
see
not
the
system
itself
that
is
to
say
this
is
a
political
issue
not
a
technical
one
