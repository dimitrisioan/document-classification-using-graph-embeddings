re
suggestions
for
escrow
agencies
was
re
more
technical
details
in
article
david
sternlight
brings
up
the
issue
of
how
the
escrow
agent
will
be
paid
and
the
fact
that
the
government
had
financial
leverage
if
they
dont
cooperate
its
an
important
issue
especially
if
one
of
the
escrow
agents
decides
theyd
rather
stop
offering
the
service
i
assume
that
if
the
escrow
agent
isnt
the
government
then
the
contract
for
providing
escrow
service
would
include
some
termination
clause
like
returning
the
keys
the
easiest
way
is
a
user
fee
for
each
clipper
chip
manufactured
this
makes
the
funding
separate
from
government
but
whos
the
user
paying
the
fees
here
and
whats
the
service
if
the
user
is
the
government
then
the
fundings
not
separate
from
the
government
if
the
user
is
the
buyer
whats
the
service
keeping
the
key
for
me
no
thanks
i
dont
need
and
wont
buy
their
service
not
telling
everybody
my
key
sounds
like
blackmail
if
the
user
is
the
manufacturer
does
the
user
have
a
choice
about
buying
the
alternative
is
to
just
generate
the
key
and
not
escrow
it
which
is
fine
id
certainly
pay
more
for
this
kind
of
key
than
an
escrowed
key
face
it
the
escrow
provider
is
providing
a
service
the
users
dont
want
the
only
people
who
want
it
are
the
government
not
the
users
what
youre
really
talking
about
is
either
the
government
paying
for
the
service
up
front
or
peryear
either
from
general
taxes
or
from
a
special
direct
tax
on
wiretap
chips
or
on
an
indirect
tax
forcing
the
manufacturer
to
pay
the
fee
to
the
escrow
agent
i
hope
the
escrow
people
have
no
way
of
finding
out
your
name
from
your
serial
number
especially
if
the
escrow
is
a
government
agency
here
in
new
jersey
we
have
lots
of
people
willing
to
provide
that
sort
of
services
for
user
fees
there
are
people
willing
to
keep
your
store
from
burning
down
for
a
small
monthly
fee
though
sometimes
people
refuse
to
pay
and
discover
that
the
service
really
was
effective
if
you
go
to
a
baseball
game
at
yankee
stadium
there
are
people
who
will
watch
your
car
in
the
parking
lot
for
a
small
user
fee
something
could
scratch
the
paint
after
all
and
what
a
shame
if
your
clipper
key
got
out

for
