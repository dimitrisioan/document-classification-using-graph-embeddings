we

this
do
we
the
algorithm
is
classified
i
speculate
from
the
mykotronx
data
sheet
on
the
myk
that
the
algorithm
is
a
classified
cryptosystem
similar
in
application
to
des
but
cleared
by
the
nsa
for
classified
traffic
that
has
been
in
use
for
a
number
of
years
myktotronx
refers
to
it
as
government
type
ii
encryption
which
matches
the
designation
of
one
of
the
types
of
encryption
available
on
stuiii
phones
and
may
be
the
same
as
a
cryptosystem
i
have
heard
called
cipher
this
would
make
sense
since
this
is
evidently
a
fieldproven
cryptosystem
which
can
act
as
a
pincompatible
substitute
for
des
combined
with
a
tappable
key
exchange
protocol
this
would
offer
exactly
what
is
claimed
for
clipper
secure
encryption
with
access
via
a
key
escrow
if
this
is
fact
the
case
it
would
make
me
quite
confident
of
the
encipherment
algorithm
itself
now
i
do
not
know
if
these
are
in
fact
the
same
cryptosystem
my
knowledge
of
classified
cryptography
isnt
even
fuzzy
its
nonexistent
however
it
would
certainly
have
been
the
leasteffort
approach
on
the
part
of
the
government
take
an
old
military
cipher
that
people
can
drop
in
place
of
des
and
which
is
at
least
as
secure
set
up
a
key
escrow
scheme
for
law
enforcement
and
promote
it
for
public
use
this
also
fits
with
mykotronx
whos
been
around
but
almost
invisible
for
years
has
anyone
else
made
this
sort
of
connection
or
am
i
just
hallucinating
pink
elephants
here
my
curiousity
has
been
piqued
