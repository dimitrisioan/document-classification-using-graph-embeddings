im
afraid
i
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
point
nsa
will
not
tell
rsa
or
any
other
nondod
entity
anything
that
its
eavesdropping
reveals
i
dont
know
about
that
they
might
if
they
find
it
the
most
expedient
way
to
keep
people
from
using
something
they
cant
crack
lets
put
it
this
way
they
have
a
charter
and
several
executive
orders
to
obey
among
other
things
which
explicitly
prohibit
sharing
this
information
unless
things
have
changed
withing
the
last
little
while
i
suppose
they
could
ignore
it
if
they
choose
but
i
doubt
they
would
for
an
authoritative
look
at
the
nsa
get
bamfords
the
puzzle
palace
thats
all
i
can
say
