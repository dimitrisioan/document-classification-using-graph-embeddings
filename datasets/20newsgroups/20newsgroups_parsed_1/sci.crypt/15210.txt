somehow
started
to
doubt
technical
competence
of
the
people
who
designed
the
system
why
on
the
earth
split
the
bit
key
in
bit
parts
to
keep
them
in
escrow
separately
having
bit
and
large
volumes
of
data
voice
links
produce
it
should
be
relatively
easy
to
break
it
when
they
simply
could
keep
bit
sequences
in
n
n
independent
places
and
then
xor
all
the
partial
keys
to
get
the
actual
key
n
sequences
should
obviously
be
selected
randomly
and
nth
is
the
actual
key
xored
with
the
random
sequences
or
is
it
a
conspiracy
