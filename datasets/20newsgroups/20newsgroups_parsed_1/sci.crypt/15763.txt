whose
parenthesized
name
is
either
an
unfortunate
coincidence
or
casts
serious
doubt
on
his
bona
fides
posts
a
message
in
which
he
seems
willing
to
take
the
word
of
a
private
firm
about
which
he
knows
little
that
their
new
encryption
algorithm
is
secure
and
contains
no
trapdoors
while
seemingly
distrusting
that
of
the
government
about

will
someone
please
post
the

faq
to
altprivacyclipper
before
someone
unfamiliar
with
him
takes
him
seriously
