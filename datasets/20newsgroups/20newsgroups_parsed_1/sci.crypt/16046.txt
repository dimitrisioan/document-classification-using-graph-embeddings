re
implementing
a
diffiehellman
key
exchange
you
should
probably
use
numbers
much
larger
than
bits
also
you
may
want
to
include
some
randomlygenerated
bitstrings
in
your
protocol
this
way
if
someone
should
find
the
shared
key
you
and
another
person
use
on
one
day
they
wont
be
able
to
guess
it
for
the
next
day
ie
a
sends
ga
mod
p
and
random
string
r
b
sends
gb
mod
p
and
random
string
r
both
find
ga
mod
p
b
mod
p
shared
key
then
both
calculate
session
key
hashrshared
key
r
also
you
will
want
to
make
sure
that
youre
getting
the
right
public
key
value
ga
mod
p
someone
with
the
power
to
intercept
and
change
messages
can
oterwise
spoof
you
by
sending
both
of
you
his
public
key
and
then
acquiring
a
session
key
with
each
of
you
