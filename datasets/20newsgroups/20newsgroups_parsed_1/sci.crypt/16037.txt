i
never

a

the

my

was
on
sun
tzu
more
to
the
point
those
who
are
called
the
good
militarists
of
old
could
make
opponents
lost
contact
between
front
and
back
lines
lose
reliability
between
large
and
small
groups
lose
mutual
concern
for
the
welfare
of
the
different
social
classes
among
them
lose
mutual
accomodation
between
the
rulers
and
the
ruled
lose
enlistments
among
the
soldiers
lose
coherence
within
the
armies
they
went
into
action
when
it
was
advantageous
stopped
when
it
was
not
today
it
is
sitting
on
your
hands
will
get
you
