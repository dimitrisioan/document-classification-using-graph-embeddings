do
you

ive

have
you
heard
of

from
your

that

pgp
is
a
freeware
rsa
encryption
program
which
includes
digital
signatures
and
comprehensive
key
management
facilities
most
sites
also
keep
the
source
code
a
growing
number
of
people
are
using
this
excellent
software
to
encrypt
to
a
very
high
standard
their

pubcypherpunkspgp
pgp
is
not
available
on
the
archive
site
rsacom
if
it
were
it
would
be
highly
amusing
since
rsacom
actually
public
key
partners
but
its
the
same
entity
is
the
organization
holding
the
patents
which
they
claim
are
violated
if
you
actually
make
use
or
sell
pgp
i
believe
those
patents
also
apply
in
canada
but
im
not
a
patent
lawyer
or
anything
there
is
no
such
thing
as
freely
redistributable
code
for
rsa
which
can
be
used
in
north
america
without
legal
entanglements
you
may
wish
to
consider
rsaref
however
which
is
available
from
the
ftp
site
rsacom
in
rsaref
but
probably
doesnt
meet
your
definition
of
freely
redistributable
its
readily
available
in
source
in
c
and
does
rsa
md
etc
and
comes
with
a
license
allowing
noncommercial
use
like
any
other
strong
crypto
software
its
not
exportable
legally
it
can
be
modified
with
permission
from
rsadsi
which
a
number
of
people
have
received
in
the
past
for
reasons
that
arent
entirely
clear
to
me
rsa
says
that
only
us
people
should
take
rsaref
from
its
server
although
there
arent
itar
issues
regarding
canada
the
ripem
distribution
site
ripemmsuedu
has
rsaref
in
its
distribution
and
is
ok
