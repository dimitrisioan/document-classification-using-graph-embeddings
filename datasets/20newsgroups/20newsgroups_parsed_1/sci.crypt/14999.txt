how
about
this
i
create
a
bunch
of
sets
of
random
data
and
encrypt
it
i
keep
only
one
of
the
sets
of
random
data
around
to
show
that
i
encypt
random
data
for
kicks
the
rest
i
delete
with
their
keys
i
tell
all
my
friends
i
think
this
establishes
reasonable
doubt
about
the
contents
of
any
encrypted
files
and
my
ability
to
provides
keys
since
anyone
could
do
this
any
law
that
forces
a
user
to
provide
keys
on
demand
is
worthless
the
law
is
much
worse
than
worthless
it
gives
police
the
power
to
put
innocent
people
in
jail
because
they
the
police
find
something
they
dont
understand
most
police
dont
know
what
the
return
key
does
never
mind
the
difference
between
a
core
file
and
classified
military
secrets
there
are
plenty
of
scenarios
where
the
user
would
have
no
idea
what
something
is
either
it
could
be
uninitialized
junk
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
user
to
show
that
its
something
a
normal
upstanding
citizen
should
have
no
one
should
ever
be
put
in
that
situation
especially
in
america
whats
disgusting
about
this
is
how
easily
most
people
go
along
with
it
to
provide
a
bargaining
chip
against
some
hypothetical
alleged
child
molester
or
drug
dealer
or
whatever
bad
thing
is
in
style
at
the
time
basically
most
people
dont
have
a
clear
distinction
between
criminals
and
suspects
as
an
analogy
its
like
they
find
a
loose
screw
in
your
house
and
they
insist
that
youre
building
a
bomb
or
machine
gun
they
ask
you
where
it
came
from
like
youd
know
and
ask
you
to
prove
your
claim
when
you
explain
it
in
such
simple
terms
people
may
start
to
get
the
idea
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
keep
random
files
on
my
disk
the
reason
is
without
specialpurpose
hardware
it
takes
a
long
time
to
generate
good
random
bits
i
have
programs
that
crank
out
a
couple
bits
per
minute
which
is
pretty
conservative
but
over
time
thats
more
than
i
need
if
you
think
about
it
theres
no
point
in
actually
encrypting
random
data
because
it
just
gives
you
different
random
data
if
you
want
some
data
to
look
like
an
encrypted
file
you
just
put
an
appropriate
header
on
it
if
enough
people
do
this
some
of
them
will
be
put
in
jail
when
you
get
arrested
and
the
police
ask
for
your
keys
you
can
tell
them
its
just
random
junk
although
of
course
they
wont
believe
you
while
youre
sitting
in
jail
you
can
take
consolation
in
the
fact
that
the
government
will
burn
a
few
cpuyears
trying
to
find
something
thats
not
there
