off

now
why
is
that
i
doubt
there
is
a
trapdoor
in
skipjack
but
we
will
never
know
and
i
doubt
the
nsa
would
promote
a
mass
market
chip
they
couldnt
compromise
ergo
nsa
is
now
capable
of
compromising
probably
with
brute
force
keysearch
engines
of
the
complexity
of
skipjack
look
at
the
specs
why
i
bet
they
have
thousands
of
little
chips
chugging
away
in
their
crypto
busters
maybe
even
tens
of
thousands
complexity
not
much
more
than
a
how
many
such
machines
will
fit
into
fort
meade
i
think
pgp
should
have
bit
idea
keys
thousands
tens
of
thousands
do
some
arithmetic
please
skipjack
has
possible
keys
lets
assume
a
bruteforce
engine
like
that
hypothesized
for
des
microsecond
per
trial
million
chips
thats
trials
per
second
or
about
years
for
trials
well
maybe
they
can
get
chips
running
at
one
trial
per
nanosecond
and
build
a
machine
with
million
chips
sure
only
years
for
each
solution
idea
uses
bit
keys
shall
i
bother
doing
the
calculations
for
you
hint
multiply
years
by
and
you
cant
do
idea
at
that
speed
key
setup
takes
much
too
long
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
that
were
the
case
for
skipjack
too
though
theres
no
way
of
knowing
just
yet
des
used
only
xor
because
thats
what
was
feasible
with
mids
technology
modern
chips
can
do
a
lot
more
nsa
may
or
may
not
know
how
to
crack
skipjack
and
idea
i
doubt
it
for
the
former
i
have
no
idea
for
the
latter
though
it
does
seem
to
be
a
strong
cryptosystem
but
it
aint
gon
na
be
by
exhaustive
search
