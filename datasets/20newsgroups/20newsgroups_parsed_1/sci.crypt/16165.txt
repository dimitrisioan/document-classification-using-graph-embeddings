encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
just
a
random
passing
thought
but
can
anyone
cite
a
documented
use
of
encryption
technology
by
criminals
and
terrorists
excluding
the
irancontra
gang
sure
the
rumrunners
in
prohibition
see
kahns
the
codebreakers
the
irony
was
they
were
using
better
codes
and
key
security
than
most
governments
were
yes
great
chapter
elizabeth
friedman
sp
comes
shining
through
however
the
chapter
also
notes
that
these
rum
runners
invented
their
own
crypto
hired
exmilitary
folks
in
fact
hows
that
for
a
revolving
door
now
given
that
todays
rum
runners
coke
runners
actually
have
even
more
money
than
yesterdays
its
reasonable
to
expect
them
to
have
even
better
cryptography
i
doubt
they
have
a
chip
foundry
of
their
own
yet
but
so
my
question
of
the
fbinistnsa
is
how
are
you
going
to
make
the
rum
runners
use
the
clipper
chip
answer
youre
not
question
ok
in
that
case
your
justification
for
taking
away
our
rights
has
evaporated
how
do
you
justify
our
loss
of
rights
if
you
cant
use
the
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
