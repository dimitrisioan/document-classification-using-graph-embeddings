think
again
you
wont
see
me
using
apples
new
signature
from
the
finder
feature
why
not
it
hasnt
been
released
so
theres
no
way
for
you
to
evaluate
it
yet
after
all
apple
could
have
been
smart
and
had
aoce
use
an
md
hash
encrypted
with
rsa
just
like
pkcs
signatures
they
could
even
be
actually
pkcs
compliant
for
all
you
know
why
not
wait
until
it
is
released
and
hard
information
is
available
before
passing
judgement
on
it
aoces
algorithms
arent
secret
because
apples
being
fascisticaoce
itself
remains
secret
except
for
apple
demos
at
macworld
simply
because
its
not
done
yet
it
may
be
flawed
and
it
may
not
however
you
cant
tell
which
until
you
actually
see
it
i
at
least
am
quite
impressed
with
what
i
have
seen
so
far
and
have
no
expectation
of
being
disappointed
