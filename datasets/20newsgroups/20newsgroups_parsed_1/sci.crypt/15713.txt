if

doesnt
have
as
much
credibility
as
youd
like
consider
this
alternative
somewhere
on
the
hard
disk
duplicated
a
few
times
keep
a
bit
random
number
when
the
bit
digest
of
your
passphrase
is
computed
it
is
xorred
with
the
random
number
before
being
used
as
the
key
for
your
hard
disk
writing
random
junk
over
the
random
numbers
makes
the
hard
disk
unreadable
by
anyone
now
if
you
were
merely
to
claim
that
you
have
written
random
junk
over
the
xor
key
noone
would
be
able
to
tell
whether
or
not
you
were
telling
the
truth
this
is
a
perjury
and
b
vunerable
to
rubberhose
cryptography
but
otherwise
