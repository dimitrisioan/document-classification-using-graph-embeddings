ok
i
should
have
read
the
thread
before
posting
my
own
i
would
just
add
to
phils
very
infomative
discussion
the
following
caveat
the
fifth
amendment
applies
only
in
crinial
cases
nor
shall
any
person
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
maybe
you
are
using
the
wrong
amendment
if
someone
were
to
seize
a
safe
containing
your
paper
records
and
demand
that
you
produce
the
combination
the
applicable
defense
would
be
on
grounds
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
the
police
would
be
entitled
to
subpoena
documents
relating
to
a
specific
matter
but
any
broad
search
such
as
implied
by
impounding
all
your
records
would
be
unconstitutional
in
the
case
of
the
safe
they
would
probably
get
a
locksmith
and
assert
that
they
only
examined
documents
covered
by
the
warrent
sure
in
the
cryptographic
case
their
only
resort
would
be
rubberhose
cryptography
this
would
also
make
a
good
mental
experiment
to
use
in
choosing
escrow
agents
would
you
trust
this
proposed
agent
with
a
key
to
your
hard
diskor
half
the
key
for
that
matter
