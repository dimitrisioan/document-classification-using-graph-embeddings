the
key
question
is
whether
nonclipper
encryption
will
be
made
illegal
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
the
clear
middle
ground
implied
by
these
statements
is
to
say
that
americans
have
the
right
to
clipper
encryption
but
not
to
unbreakable
encryption
this
implies
that
ultimately
nonclipper
strong
encryption
must
become
illegal
text
deleted
no
value
judgement
implied
its
shocking
and
frightening
to
see
that
this
is
actually
happening
here
hal
finney
more
than
shocking
what
this
says
to
me
is
no
less
than
that
government
is
very
interested
in
monitoring
the
public
this
does
more
than
scare
me
it
mortifies
me
pgp
and
ripem
must
become
widespread
enough
to
resist
what
mr
finney
has
imho
correctly
identified
as
the
next
logical
step
what
was
once
an
academic
discussion
with
regard
to
concealing
cyphertext
has
now
become
a
real
consideration
the
rhetoric
that
the
clinton
administration
seems
obsessed
with
harmony
either
or
propositions
tension
tells
me
that
they
know
how
difficult
it
will
be
to
sell
this
proposition
the
phrase
i
hear
more
and
more
is
i
cant
believe
this
is
actually
happening
here
call
me
conserative
clinton
was
a
huge
mistake
that
well
all
be
paying
for
tommorow
and
many
years
from
now
have
we
approached
the
age
of
speakeasy
public
key
depositiories
uni
dark
public
keys
by
finger
andor
request
public
key
archives
at
sovereignty
is
the
sign
of
a
brutal
past
