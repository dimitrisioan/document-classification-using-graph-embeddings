just
a
question
as
a
provider
of
a
public
bbs
service
arent
you
bound
by
law
to
gurantee
intelligble
access
to
the
data
of
the
users
on
the
bbs
if
police
comes
with
sufficent
authorisation
i
guessed
this
would
be
a
basic
condition
for
such
systems
i
did
run
a
bbs
some
time
ago
but
that
was
in
switzerland
you
are
obliged
to
let
the
police
search
the
equipment
if
they
have
a
proper
court
order
you
are
under
no
legal
obligation
to
keep
the
data
intelligble
if
you
wish
to
run
your
bbs
entirely
with
all
data
encrypted
such
that
if
the
police
show
up
they
can
not
read
anything
well
thats
their
problem
there
are
no
legal
restrictions
on
domestic
use
of
cryptography
in
the
united
states
yet
