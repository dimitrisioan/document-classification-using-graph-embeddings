may
as
well
look
at
one
piece
of
this
at
a
time
this
paragraph
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
means
they
arent
planning
to
make
it
public
as
was
done
with
des
as
it
says
in
both
scicrypt
faqs
theres
no
way
we
are
going
to
achieve
the
same
level
of
comfort
with
clipper
that
we
finally
have
with
des
if
we
cant
actually
get
our
hands
on
the
bits
and
watch
them
flow
around
even
the
best
experts
arent
going
to
think
of
everything
look
how
long
it
took
biham
and
shamir
to
get
a
handle
on
just
how
good
des
is
and
for
all
we
know
theres
still
more
to
learn
