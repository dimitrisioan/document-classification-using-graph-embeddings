c
may
writes
but
is
it
any
worse
than
the
current
unsecure
system
it
becomes
much
worse
of
course
if
the
government
then
uses
this
clinton
clipper
to
argue
for
restrictions
on
unapproved
encryption
this
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
us
i
think
the
camels
nose
in
the
tent
etc
not
to
pick
on
mr
may
in
particular
of
course
but
isnt
this
kind
of
the
domino
theory
when
one
little
country
falls
its
neighbor
will
surely
follow
and
before
you
know
it
were
all
mining
salt
in
siberia
for
not
turning
in
our
captain
crunch
secret
decoder
rings
surely
the
hypothesis
relying
on
the
least
wild
assumptions
is
to
take
this
at
face
value
our
lads
at
the
fort
were
asked
to
cook
up
something
thats
pretty
secure
with
a
key
that
can
be
escrowed
neatly
and
they
did
the
government
plans
to
sell
this
thing
for
the
reasons
they
state
yes
those
evil
guys
in
the
fbi
can
probably
with
some
effort
abuse
the
system
i
got
news
for
you
if
the
evil
guys
in
the
fbi
decide
they
want
to
persecute
you
theyre
gon
na
and
youre
gon
na
hate
it
fact
is
the
fbi
doesnt
want
to
listen
to
your
phone
calls
and
if
they
do
and
if
youre
using
tripledes
theyll
just
get
a
parabolic
microphone
and
point
it
at
your
head
with
email
if
they
cant
break
your
pgp
encryption
theyll
just
call
up
one
of
their
tempest
trucks
and
read
the
electromagnetic
emmisions
from
your
computer
or
terminal
note
that
measures
to
protect
yourself
from
tempest
surveillance
are
still
classified
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
pretty
clearly
an
effort
by
the
government
to
do
exactly
what
theyre
saying
theyre
doing
as
is
typical
with
governments
its
mismanaged
and
full
of
holes
and
compromises
as
is
typical
with
our
government
its
not
too
bad
could
be
worse
my
interpretation
andrew
tim
may
whose
sig
block
may
get
him
busted
in
the
new
regime
isnt
this
just
a
little
melodramatic
if
the
new
regime
comes
to
fruition
make
sure
you
protect
your
first
amendment
rights
by
asserting
your
second
amendment
rights
