like
know
the
consequences
of
those
types
of
actions
if
i
so
chose
to
do
them
in
the
future
in
this
country
and
european
countries
people
have
been
encrypting
notes
in
their
notebooks
for
hundreds
of
years
maybe
over
a
thousand
its
a
long
tradition
dating
at
least
back
to
the
alchemists
i
know
of
nothing
bad
happening
to
them
i
would
assume
that
nothing
bad
would
happen
to
you
given
this
long
history
establishing
encryption
as
the
property
of
individuals
