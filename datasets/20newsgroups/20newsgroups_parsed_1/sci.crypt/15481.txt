re
fighting
the
clipper
initiative
as
a
flaming
libertarian
paranoid
extremist
iat
a
loss
for
specific
objections
that
dont
sound
frighteningly
technical
the
idea
that
foisting
the
cripple
chip
standard
on
us
manufacturers
would
result
in
saying
sayonara
to
yet
another
hightech
market
isnt
technical
isnt
in
the
least
difficult
to
understand
and
plays
on
a
concern
lots
of
people
are
worried
about
already
could
you
expand
on
this
simple
if
you
have
a
choice
between
american
manufacturers
peddling
cripple
chips
with
a
secret
untested
algorithm
whose
keys
are
held
by
people
with
a
history
of
untrustworthy
behavoir
or
japanese
to
pick
the
obvious
example
manufacturers
peddling
encryption
chips
with
an
algorithm
that
has
faced
public
scrutiny
and
keys
under
the
control
of
the
user
which
would
you
choose
at
most
the
american
government
can
deny
this
choice
to
american
citizens
and
probably
not
that
if
the
glorious
success
of
the
war
on
drugs
is
any
example
it
cant
do
much
about
the
global
market
