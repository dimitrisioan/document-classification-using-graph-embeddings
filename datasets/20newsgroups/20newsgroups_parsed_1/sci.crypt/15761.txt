estimating

would
wiretap

be
costeffective
by

draft
april
summary
compared
to
an
average
monthly
phone
bill
of
sixty
dollars
wiretaps
are
only
worth
two
cents
a
month
to
police
so
the
proposed
wiretap
chip
must
raise
phone
costs
by
less
than
one
part
in
three
thousand
to
be
costeffective
background
until
now
phones
have
happened
to
allow
the
existence
of
wiretaps
detectors
which
could
pick
up
conversations
on
a
phone
line
and
over
time
law
enforcement
agencies
have
come
to
rely
on
this
capability
to
aid
in
criminal
investigations
however
powerful
new
encryption
technologies
threaten
this
status
quo
by
making
possible
truly
private
communication
a
small
chip
in
each
phone
could
soon
make
it
literally
impossible
to
overhear
a
conversation
without
physical
microphones
at
either
end
in
order
to
preserve
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
agencies
to
tap
phone
conversations
the
us
government
announced
on
april
that
it
had
developed
and
begun
manufacturing
a
special
wiretap
chip
to
be
placed
in
future
phones
instead
of
the
total
privacy
chips
which
have
been
under
private
development
the
same
day
att
announced
it
would
use
these
chips
in
all
its
secure
telephone
products
each
chip
would
be
created
under
government
supervision
when
it
would
be
given
a
fixed
indentifier
and
encryption
key
periodically
during
each
conversation
the
chip
would
broadcast
its
identifier
and
other
info
in
a
special
law
enforcement
block
law
enforcement
officers
with
a
court
order
could
then
obtain
the
key
corresponding
to
the
indentifier
from
special
trust
agencies
and
could
thereby
listen
in
on
any
future
or
previously
recorded
conversations
on
that
phone
to
date
most
concerns
voiced
about
this
plan
have
been
about
its
security
the
government
wont
disclose
the
encryption
algorithm
and
many
suspect
the
government
will
not
limit
its
access
in
the
way
it
has
claimed
the
track
record
of
previous
governments
does
not
inspire
confidence
on
this
point
however
this
paper
will
neglect
these
concerns
and
ask
instead
whether
this
new
wiretap
chip
is
a
costeffective
tool
for
police
investigation
that
is
which
is
a
cheaper
way
for
society
to
investigate
crime
force
phone
communications
to
support
wiretaps
or
give
police
agencies
more
money
to
investigate
crimes
in
other
ways
or
to
put
it
another
way
would
police
agencies
be
willing
to
pay
for
each
wiretap
if
they
had
to
pay
their
share
of
the
full
social
cost
of
forcing
phones
to
support
wiretaps
to
start
to
answer
this
question
we
might
compare
the
current
benefits
wiretaps
provide
to
law
enforcement
agencies
with
projected
costs
of
implementing
the
new
wiretap
chip
plan
and
since
current
benefits
are
easier
to
estimate
we
begin
there
wiretap
benefits
is
the
latest
year
for
which
wiretap
statistics
are
available
in
that
year
wiretap
installations
were
requested
and
no
requests
were
denied
this
figure
does
not
include
wiretaps
obtained
with
the
consent
of
a
party
to
the
conversation
arrests
resulted
from
wiretaps
started
the
same
year
arrests
came
from
wiretaps
in
previous
years
and
of
arrests
led
to
convictions
of
the
wiretaps
were
for
phones
vs
pagers
email
etc
were
regarding
drug
offenses
and
were
requested
by
federal
authorities
each
wiretap
installation
heard
an
average
of
calls
of
them
incriminating
among
people
and
cost
an
average
of
extrapolating
from
the
installations
reporting
costs
mostly
for
labor
thus
a
total
of
about
million
was
spent
on
wiretaps
to
obtain
about
arrests
at
per
arrest
thus
these
arrests
are
at
least
four
times
more
expensive
than
the
per
arrest
figure
one
gets
by
dividing
the
billion
spent
by
all
police
nationally
by
the
total
million
nontraffic
arrests
thus
the
million
per
year
spent
on
phone
taps
is
only
one
thousanth
of
the
total
police
expenditures
and
if
we
divide
this
by
the
million
phone
access
lines
in
the
country
we
get
about
cents
spent
per
year
per
phone
line
or
about
two
cents
a
month
in
general
we
deter
a
given
class
of
criminals
through
a
combination
of
a
perceived
probability
of
being
caught
and
convicted
and
some
expected
punishment
level
if
convicted
so
the
social
value
of
having
wiretaps
is
no
more
than
the
amount
that
we
would
have
to
pay
to
get
the
same
criminal
deterrence
through
other
means
if
unable
to
wiretap
a
particular
suspects
phone
police
might
instead
use
hidden
microphones
or
investigate
that
suspect
in
other
ways
or
police
might
focus
on
suspects
more
easily
investigated
without
wiretaps
or
we
might
raise
the
fine
or
prison
time
for
certain
types
of
crime
if
we
generously
assume
that
these
substitutes
for
wiretaps
would
be
on
average
twice
as
expensive
as
wiretaps
then
the
annual
social
benefit
of
phone
wiretaps
is
about
equal
to
the
current
spending
level
of
two
cents
a
month
per
phone
line
wiretap
costs
let
us
for
the
moment
optimistically
assume
that
the
us
government
encryption
scheme
is
as
secure
as
whatever
private
enterprise
would
have
offered
instead
protecting
our
conversations
from
the
spying
ears
of
neighbors
corporations
and
governments
both
foreign
and
domestic
even
so
the
need
to
support
wiretaps
would
add
many
additional
costs
to
build
and
maintain
our
communication
system
extra
law
enforcement
blocks
would
be
added
to
phone
transmissions
increasing
traffic
by
some
unknown
percentage
a
special
process
must
be
used
to
add
encryption
keys
to
chips
while
securely
distributing
these
keys
to
special
agencies
which
must
be
funded
and
monitored
the
chips
themselves
are
designed
by
a
military
contractor
whose
design
is
to
remain
secret
and
are
manufactured
through
a
special
process
so
that
the
chip
becomes
nearly
impossible
to
take
apart
chips
are
now
offered
at
the
relatively
high
price
of
a
peice
in
lots
of
private
encryption
systems
not
supporting
wiretaps
would
require
none
of
these
extra
costs
perhaps
most
important
government
degree
would
at
least
partially
replace
private
marketplace
evolution
of
standards
for
how
voice
is
to
be
represented
encrypted
and
exchanged
in
our
future
phones
it
is
widely
believed
that
governments
are
less
efficient
than
private
enterprise
in
procuring
products
and
standards
though
they
may
perhaps
perform
a
useful
brokering
role
when
we
choose
between
competing
private
standards
how
much
less
efficient
is
a
matter
of
debate
some
say
they
pay
twice
as
much
while
others
might
say
only
more
currently
a
total
of
billion
is
spent
as
operating
expenses
of
us
phone
companies
which
comes
out
to
about
per
month
per
access
line
if
we
compare
this
to
the
wiretap
value
of
two
cents
per
month
we
see
that
if
wiretaps
raise
average
operating
costs
by
even
as
much
as
one
part
in
then
wiretaps
are
not
cost
effective
and
this
doesnt
even
include
extra
costs
phone
owners
pay
because
their
encryption
chips
are
more
expensive
of
course
most
phones
wouldnt
have
encryption
chips
for
a
while
but
the
wiretap
benefit
per
phone
is
still
the
same
so
this
argument
still
applies
conclusion
given
this
dramatic
difference
between
the
total
cost
of
running
the
phone
system
and
the
value
of
wiretaps
we
can
justify
only
the
slightest
modification
of
the
phone
system
to
accommodate
wiretaps
when
the
only
modification
required
was
to
allow
investigators
in
to
attach
clips
to
phone
wires
wiretap
support
may
have
been
reasonable
but
when
we
consider
substantial
modification
the
burden
of
proof
is
clearly
on
those
proposing
such
modification
to
show
that
the
costs
would
really
be
less
than
the
benefits
if
consensus
can
not
be
obtain
on
this
costbenefit
estimate
a
compromise
might
be
to
tax
phones
which
do
not
support
wiretaps
at
a
rate
of
say
five
cents
per
month
a
tax
payable
to
police
agencies
nationwide
to
compensate
them
for
their
loss
of
wiretap
abilities
