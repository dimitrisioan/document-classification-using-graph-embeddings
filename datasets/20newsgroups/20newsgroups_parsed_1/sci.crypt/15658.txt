clipper
chip
facts
a
request
having
read
the
various
clipper
announcements
on
the
net
over
the
last
few
days
and
a
lot
of
uninformed
speculation
about
the
chip
its
uses
government
plots
etc
i
have
the
following
questions
what
does
the
clipper
chip
actually
implement
just
the
skipjack
cryptographic
algorithm
or
does
it
also
implement
a
chip
to
chip
communications
protocol
if
it
does
implement
a
communications
protocol
can
it
be
used
as
just
a
crypt
chip
also
where
can
the
chip
specifications
and
spec
sheets
be
obtained
who
may
purchase
them
and
under
what
conditions
are
there
restrictions
as
to
how
the
chip
may
be
used
in
a
system
the
security
of
the
algorithm
and
the
encrypted
communications
does
not
appear
to
require
that
the
family
key
be
a
secret
why
is
it
a
secret
what
happens
when
the
family
key
becomes
well
known
if
its
a
secret
to
make
traffic
analysis
more
difficult
does
the
law
enforcement
message
contain
any
random
information
how
much
and
how
random
is
it
can
the
chip
be
programmed
to
reveal
the
unit
key
the
chip
serial
number
any
of
the
programming
parameters
