re
once
tapped
your
code
is
no
good
any
more
for
example
i
dont
own
a
cordless
phone
with
clipper
i
would
if
the
local
men
in
blue
really
want
to
listen
to
me
talk
to
my
friends
or
order
pizza
im
no
worse
off
than
i
am
now
and
i
dont
have
to
worry
about
local
kids
or
nosy
neighbors
i
do
tend
to
agree
sigh
so
where
can
i
buy
a
desencrypted
cellular
phone
how
much
does
it
cost
of
course
if
we
didnt
have
government
monopolies
on
cellular
phone
service
there
probably
would
be
some
available
how
can
you
reconcile
the
administrations
self
proclaimed
purpose
of
providing
law
enforcement
with
access
to
encrypted
data
without
making
the
clipper
system
the
only
crypto
available
in
the
us
the
second
and
fourth
amendments
do
come
to
mind
the
second
amendment
is
especially
apt
given
the
itar
definitions
of
crypto
equipment
as
munitions
and
the
guncontrol
peoples
increasing
ability
to
define
things
as
assault
weapons
and
make
them
illegal
tripledes
is
obviously
used
for
assault
phones
while
cripple
will
be
legal
and
triplecripple
may
fall
into
the
gray
area
of
illegally
upgrading
to
an
assault
phone
pray
for
peace
