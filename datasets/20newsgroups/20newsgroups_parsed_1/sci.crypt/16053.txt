writes
great
slogan
im
ready
to
sign
up
with
a
cryptolobbying
effort
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
do
it
through
an
nra
offshoot
shall
we
also
push
for
the
cra
cryptographic
rights
amendment
looking
at
it
from
up
here
in
the
frozen
north
it
looks
like
you
could
do
worse
than
get
the
nra
involved
they
have
a
kindred
problem
a
large
number
of
voters
the
right
attitude
and
lots
of
funds
from
an
ethical
or
constitutional
viewpoint
i
havent
seen
a
good
argument
for
cryptographic
rights
that
doesnt
also
support
the
nra
position
on
guns
and
viceversa
