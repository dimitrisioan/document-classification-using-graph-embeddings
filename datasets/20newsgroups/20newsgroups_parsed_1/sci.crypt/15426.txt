subject
re
more
technical
details
hmm
followup
on
my
own
posting
well
who
cares
first
let
me
try
to
work
out
the
facts
that
we
get
to
know
about
the
clipperchip
from
what
hellman
and
denning
were
able
to
tell
us
the
chip
itself
is
not
confined
to
digital
telephony
but
performs
general
encryption
in
a
symmetric
manner
the
chip
supports
cfb
ofb
ecb
and
whatever
the
fourth
mode
of
operation
for
des
is
the
algorithm
consists
of
rounds
of
whatever
and
takes
bit
keys
input
data
seems
to
be
bit
yes
so
if
two
people
want
secure
communication
whatever
that
means
when
clipper
is
involved
they
have
first
to
agree
on
one
secret
key
or
is
it
one
key
per
direction
they
can
exchange
this
key
via
dhschemes
or
however
somehow
the
two
feed
their
so
won
secret
key
into
the
clipperchip
which
is
now
ready
to
work
the
clipper
chip
carries
an
unique
serialnumber
bits
and
keybits
these
keybits
seem
to
have
been
gained
by
encrypting
the
serialnumber
with
seedbits
the
seedbits
seem
not
to
be
stored
in
the
chip
at
beginning
of
communication
and
perhaps
at
certain
invtervals
whithin
before
sending
the
fist
real
bit
output
of
the
first
encryption
the
clipper
chip
puts
out
packets
i
guess
which
represent
the
serial
number
and
the
session
key
this
might
look
like
x
ek
chipkeykk
serial
number
where
x
is
a
transformation
of
these
packets
involving
a
familykey
this
familyspkey
is
equal
for
all
chips
x
might
be
a
simple
xor
after
that
the
digital
phonecall
can
be
done
as
usual
every
packet
being
encrypted
and
decrypted
by
clipper
denning
describes
how
k
and
k
shall
be
generated
using
a
seed
of
bits
now
leaving
alone
politics
which
does
not
concern
me
as
much
as
you
not
being
an
american
citicientm
there
are
some
weak
points
in
this
scheme
which
might
be
exploited
by
several
parties
as
far
as
i
know
about
the
generation
of
kk
s
and
s
look
like
the
obvious
backdoor
they
could
be
used
to
generate
the
chipkeys
by
knowing
the
serialnumber
and
also
the
familykey
of
the
chip
i
really
cant
imagine
why
these
seeds
would
be
needed
otherwise
as
true
randomsources
for
the
generation
of
the
kk
can
be
bought
for
not
to
much
money
then
the
escrows
each
of
them
will
get
bit
of
a
bit
key
security
could
as
little
as
existant
be
maximized
by
giving
them
bits
each
which
have
to
be
xored
together
to
give
the
kk
now
lets
simply
assume
the
escrows
are
trustworthy
and
cant
be
fooled
by
criminals
or
law
enforchemnt
agencies
and
there
will
be
no
quarrel
between
escrows
and
lea
which
would
hinder
the
lea
in
doing
their
duties
and
so
on
and
so
on
once
the
keys
are
surrendered
the
corresponding
chip
is
compromised
forever
not
very
clever
imho
how
about
sending
in
the
encrypted
sessionkeys
for
each
phonecall
that
the
police
or
whoever
wants
to
listen
to
escrows
could
then
simply
decode
this
sessionkey
and
send
it
back
to
police
and
would
naturally
not
do
this
after
the
warrant
has
expired
this
would
be
a
better
technical
solution
but
i
guess
politics
will
not
work
that
way
apparently
as
miss
dennings
stated
the
only
one
performing
actually
decodes
of
intercepted
messages
shall
be
the
fbi
great
so
local
guys
can
not
inter
cept
understand
your
traffic
anymore
does
this
mean
that
the
fbi
monopolizes
the
right
to
do
legal
wiretaps
how
is
law
over
there
i
have
no
idea
who
is
allowed
to
tap
and
who
not
this
certainly
means
that
watched
communi
cations
will
be
routed
automatically
from
the
serviceproviding
company
to
the
fbi
if
the
communicaiton
is
a
watched
one
and
this
means
as
far
as
i
understand
it
that
the
familykey
has
to
be
known
by
each
switching
company
and
those
providing
cellularphone
servies
etcetc
so
the
familykey
will
not
be
very
secret
and
thus
serialnumbers
of
calls
will
be
readable
by
anybody
who
cares
i
like
trafficanalysis
what
do
you
guess
what
happens
if
you
use
the
chip
in
ecb
mode
and
the
first
few
packets
of
the
chip
are
somehow
lost
or
garbled
so
the
session
key
would
not
be
actually
broadcasted
over
the
line
hmmm
shouldnt
be
so
difficult
to
do
that
and
now
a
last
point
for
the
other
side
after
all
i
have
read
and
heard
about
clipper
not
the
programming
language
for
dbase
is
it
it
seems
to
have
many
advantages
which
shold
not
be
overseen
now
an
afterthought
to
your
rights
please
note
that
i
have
no
idea
what
i
am
talking
about
from
ef
amendment
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
if
this
text
is
actually
in
your
bill
of
rights
who
can
overrule
this
but
freedom
of
speech
is
not
secrecy
of
speech
maybe
you
need
to
extend
your
amendment
to
cover
information
and
communication
too
i
am
not
very
sure
in
what
position
your
government
actually
is
legally
when
it
tries
to
ban
cryptography
and
arms
amendment
say
you
may
have
them
but
not
under
what
conditions
hmm
tricky
situation
actually
it
will
make
not
much
sense
to
discuss
that
topic
in
scicrypt
discussion
of
technical
details
and
vulnerabilites
of
the
system
are
highly
suggested
