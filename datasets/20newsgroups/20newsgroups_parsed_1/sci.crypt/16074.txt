a
long
response
to
the
issue
of
registering
a
phoneclipper
relationship
it
doesnt
wash
recall
that
law
enforcement
gets
a
court
order
to
tap
a
suspects
phone
calls
they
do
what
they
do
nowfigure
out
which
lines
to
tap
they
then
record
the
stuff
if
its
clipper
they
read
the
law
enforcement
block
extract
the
serial
number
and
get
the
keys
using
the
court
order
no
new
difficulties
such
as
using
someone
elses
phone
instrument
or
phone
line
are
introduced
that
wouldnt
have
existed
absent
clipper
if
the
crooks
were
going
to
use
a
pay
phone
say
they
could
have
done
so
without
clipper
if
the
government
figures
out
theyre
so
doing
they
listen
in
and
if
its
a
clipper
conversation
they
get
the
serial
number
and
then
the
keys
if
the
crooks
use
an
innocent
persons
clipper
phone
on
the
tapped
line
theres
no
problem
the
feds
dont
care
whose
phone
instrument
is
used
just
that
the
conversation
is
by
the
suspect
on
the
tapped
line
they
get
the
serial
number
get
the
keys
and
they
are
in
business
no
clipper
chip
to
person
association
is
ever
needed
