screw
the
people
crypto
is
for
hardcore
hackers
spooks
only
since
the
wiretap
chip
is
being
distributed
internationally
allowing
the
us
government
to
spy
on
foreign
governments
companies
and
people
as
as
well
as
to
wiretap
domestic
citizens
this
is
a
worldwide
issue
please
put
distribution
world
on
the
distrubution
line
thank
you
the
jester
writes
however
assuming
that
i
can
still
encrypt
things
as
i
please
who
cares
about
the
clipper
chip
you
dont
care
that
people
are
being
lied
to
fooled
into
believing
the
chip
gives
privacy
when
it
fact
it
allows
wiretaps
you
dont
give
a
shit
about
anybodys
privacy
except
your
own
and
not
even
your
own
are
you
so
smart
that
you
know
when
youre
talking
to
somebody
who
has
a
wiretap
chip
on
their
phone
instead
of
a
privacy
chip
with
private
keys
attitude
that
everyone
else
should
have
instead
of
worrying
about
a
clipper
chip
simply
connect
your
handset
to
your
computer
and
feed
the
voice
single
through
process
encrypt
and
transmit
over
the
phone
the
guy
on
the
other
hand
then
does
the
same
in
reverse
simply
everyone
should
have
this
attitude
the
only
people
who
can
have
this
attitude
are
the
most
hardcore
computer
hackers
who
never
make
phone
calls
away
from
their
computer
who
apparently
never
call
anybody
except
another
computer
hacker
or
perhaps
another
spook
us
classified
agents
refuse
to
use
their
own
system
only
oblivious
civilian
dupes
get
that
dubious
privilege
only
spooks
and
hardcore
hackers
need
privacy
huh
we
do
need
an
alternative
to
nsabugged
telephones
but
were
talking
inexpensive
telephones
here
including
handsized
cellulars
that
need
strong
crypto
real
privacy
makeshift
computer
hacker
rigs
that
require
living
by
your
computer
to
talk
privately
over
the
phone
are
just
a
dumb
stunt
that
doesnt
do
anything
for
anybodys
privacy
in
the
real
world
what
we
need
is
a
true
privacy
chip
for
example
a
realtime
voiceencryption
rsa
put
it
into
a
silicon
compiler
and
spit
out
asic
put
this
chip
on
the
market
as
a
de
facto
standard
for
international
business
diplomats
and
private
communications
if
the
us
bans
it
we
make
it
somewhere
else
and
import
it
the
japanese
german
dutch
taiwanese
korean
etc
electronics
companies
dont
want
the
nsa
spying
on
them
us
workers
lose
more
jobs
to
government
fascist
stupidity
