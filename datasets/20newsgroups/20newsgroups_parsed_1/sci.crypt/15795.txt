re
do
we
need
the
clipper
for
cheap
security
there
are
chips
which
perform
the
voice
compressionexpansion
they
cant
be
expensive
because
they
exist
in
many
phones
connected
to
pbxs
or
on
the
pbx
line
cards
as
well
as
in
a
lot
of
equipment
which
compresses
voicegrade
circuits
to
save
the
cost
of
longdistance
leased
ts
or
satellite
circuits
i
cant
remember
the
generic
term
for
these
chips
my
impression
is
that
this
was
a
big
deal
years
ago
but
circuits
have
gotten
so
cheap
that
it
isnt
done
much
now
lew

niels
bohr
or
somebody
like
that
