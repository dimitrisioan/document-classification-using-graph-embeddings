perhaps
these
encryptiononly
types
would
defend
the
digitized
porn
if
it
was
posted
encrypted
these
issues
are
not
as
seperable
as
you
maintain
now
why
would
anyone
post
anything
encrypted
encryption
is
only
of
use
between
persons
who
know
how
to
decrypt
the
data
and
why
should
i
care
what
other
people
look
at
i
was
responding
to
another
person
tarl
neustaedter
who
held
that
the
eff
wasnt
the
best
organization
to
fight
for
crytography
rights
since
the
eff
also
supports
the
right
to
distribute
pornography
over
the
internet
something
some
crypto
people
might
object
to
in
other
words
hes
implying
that
there
are
people
who
will
protect
any
speech
just
as
long
as
it
is
encrypted
