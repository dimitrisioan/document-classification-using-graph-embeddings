i
wouldnt
think
so
asking
people
to
trust
a
secret
algorithm
seems
unsound
to
me
maybe
so
but
its
quite
common
not
when
your
talking
about
cryptography
there
are
millions
of
macintosh
users
who
have
no
idea
whats
in
apples
patented
roms
many
have
modems
connected
how
do
you
know
all
your
business
secrets
arent
being
stolen
answer
because
you
trust
apple
think
again
you
wont
see
me
using
apples
new
signature
from
the
finder
feature
because
if
any
such
attempt
however
sophicsticated
came
out
it
would
destroy
apples
credibility
forever
this
analogy
fails
in
its
assumption
that
the
government
gives
two
squirts
about
credibility
in
addition
apples
proclaimed
purpose
in
releasing
the
macintosh
wasnt
survellience
quite
the
opposite
on
january
apple
will
introduce
macintosh
and
youll
see
why
wont
be
like
so
dont
give
me
any
bullshit
analogies
about
how
we
trust
coke
not
to
put
mind
control
drugs
in
every
can
to
get
us
to
buy
more
in
the
clipper
case
a
representative
body
of
experts
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
audit
it
and
well
have
assurances
maybe
even
from
the
president
that
other
than
the
escrowed
keys
there
are
no
back
doors
while
some
may
not
have
confidence
in
that
i
am
not
among
them
its
a
lot
more
assurance
than
we
get
for
many
things
we
routinely
trust
in
everyday
life
one
of
the
reasons
we
should
be
all
the
more
suspicious
when
was
the
last
time
the
president
wasted
his
time
to
comfort
americans
just
another
reason
to
look
closely
at
exactally
whats
going
on

david
