why
are
we
being
censored
in
a
free
america
this
node
specificaly
i
have
been
scanning
and
trying
to
read
the
articles
in
the
scicrypt
area
but
what
do
i
get
surprisingly
the
blurb
comes
upon
the
screen
file
xxx
has
either
been
cancelled
or
expired
now
i
ask
you
if
it
expired
wouldnt
it
be
out
of
the
available
file
cache
i
am
and
not
a
paranoid
but
the
older
i
get
the
greater
my
cynicism
of
both
federal
and
state
governments
becomes
the
censorship
of
this
internet
and
it
is
no
less
than
censorship
stupid
me
its
the
govt
is
ridiculous
the
japanese
have
far
outstripped
our
ciphertechnology
and
our
government
is
now
before
your
very
observant
eyes
trying
to
force
the
crypto
standard
onto
a
framefork
where
the
standard
is
now
an
ancient
relic
in
terms
of
modern
japanese
security
techniques
now
i
pose
the
question
why
censor
folks
on
the
net
and
send
the
warning
shown
above
cancelled
or
expired
when
it
would
be
wiser
to
not
let
people
see
the
post
at
all
which
article
of
the
constitution
gives
me
the
right
of
revolution
if
things
seem
to
be
going
cockeyed
