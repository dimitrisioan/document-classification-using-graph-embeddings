looks

dorothy
dennings
wrongheaded
ideas
have
gotten
to
the
administration
even
sooner
than
we
feared
id
lay
long
odds
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
clinton
didnt
just
pull
this
plan
out
of
any
bodily
orifices
the
nsa
has
to
have
been
working
on
it
for
years
while
its
possible
that
denning
and
other
prominent
people
just
happened
to
start
arguing
for
such
a
system
it
seems
more
likely
that
there
was
a
suggestion
involved
if
this
guess
is
wrong
i
apologize
im
sure
dorothy
denning
is
an
honest
person
and
wouldnt
lie
to
us
simply
think
up
a
question
to
ask
her
about
her
involvement
but
be
very
careful
to
phrase
it
in
such
a
way
that
there
can
be
no
jesuitical
evasion
or
a
true
but
wholly
misleading
answer
in
this
country
mi
are
experts
at
answering
these
questions
for
instance
there
was
a
british
journalist
jonathon
moyle
killed
in
south
america
a
couple
of
years
ago
parliament
asked
was
he
an
mi
employee
no
turns
out
afterwards
he
wasnt
paid
therefore
wasnt
an
employee
they
could
equally
have
said
he
wasnt
an
agent
he
went
abroad
on
his
private
business
with
no
brief
from
mi
but
was
interviewed
and
debriefed
at
length
only
on
his
return
