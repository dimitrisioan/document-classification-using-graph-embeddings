clipper
chip
is
a
response
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
business
or
professional
body
in
a
position
to
establish
a
standard
and
provide
chipsets
to
implement
it
for
analog
or
digial
transmission
systems
rsa
might
be
in
position
to
do
it
if
they
had
active
cooperation
of
a
couple
of
manufacturers
of
cellular
phones
or
desktop
phones
is
rsa
independt
of
the
gov
enough
to
spearhead
this
i
for
one
would
gladly
pay
royalties
via
purchasing
secure
phones
hear
hear
i
completely
agree
that
we
need
to
work
quickly
to
establish
alternatives
to
the
governments
clinton
clipper
as
brad
templeton
and
others
have
noted
once
the
clipper
becomes
ensconced
in
enough
phones
there
will
be
enormous
pressure
to
make
it
the
legal
standard
and
it
will
become
the
market
standard
as
well
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
in
the
proposal
about
whether
the
use
of
clipper
is
mandated
about
whether
nonescrow
alternatives
will
be
allowed
etc
there
are
also
unclear
issues
about
how
hard
or
how
illegal
it
will
be
to
make
workalikes
which
meet
the
standard
but
which
generate
phony
or
untappable
keysim
sure
the
next
several
weeks
will
see
these
issues
thrashed
out
in
this
and
other
groups
meanwhile
id
be
interested
to
hear
rsa
data
securitys
reaction
often
criticized
in
this
group
for
their
licensing
policies
the
usual
complaints
about
mailsafe
costing
too
much
at
or
so
and
the
general
issue
of
software
patents
we
may
find
that
allying
ourselves
with
rsa
is
the
best
thing
we
can
do
whats
a
mere
licensing
fee
when
our
liberty
may
be
at
stake
if
everyone
who
wanted
true
security
paid
say
for
a
lifetime
use
of
all
of
rsas
patentswhich
expire
in
the
period
or
sothen
rsa
would
make
tons
of
money
and
be
happy
im
sure
a
small
price
to
pay
for
those
to
whom
sounds
like
too
much
im
sure
the
actual
terms
could
be
different
spread
out
over
several
years
whatever
to
me
its
a
small
price
to
pay
strong
crypto
means
strong
privacy
escrowing
keys
sending
copies
of
keys
to
large
databases
and
splitting
keys
into
two
bit
pieces
all
done
with
secret
and
nonanalyzable
protocols
and
algorithms
is
not
strong
crypto
whatever
some
of
us
may
think
about
the
abstract
principles
of
patenting
number
theory
applications
this
minor
issue
pales
in
comparison
with
the
potential
dangers
of
the
clipper
proposal
note
that
i
said
potentialwell
presumably
learn
more
in
the
coming
months
the
rsa
algorithms
are
at
least
public
have
been
analyzed
and
attacked
for
years
and
source
code
is
available
to
better
ensure
no
deliberate
weakenesses
or
trapdoors
i
know
of
a
number
of
groups
putting
together
voice
encryption
systems
using
offtheshelf
hardware
like
soundblaster
boards
for
the
pc
and
celptype
software
the
new
generations
of
pcs
using
fast
s
and
pentiums
are
fast
enough
to
do
realtime
voice
encryption
combined
with
diffiehellman
key
exchange
this
should
provide
an
alternative
to
the
clipper
system
of
course
we
dont
really
know
if
the
administration
proposes
to
outlaw
competing
systems
it
seems
to
me
that
their
goal
of
tapping
terrorists
child
pornographers
and
hilary
bashers
would
be
thwarted
if
lowcost
alternatives
to
clipper
proliferated
not
to
defend
child
pornographers
or
terrorists
but
limiting
basic
freedoms
to
catch
a
few
criminals
is
not
the
american
way
of
doing
things
end
of
soapbox
mode
i
suggest
we
in
these
groups
set
aside
any
differences
we
may
have
had
with
rsa
and
dont
look
at
mei
have
both
macpgp
and
a
fully
legal
copy
of
mailsafe
and
instead
work
with
them
as
quickly
as
we
can
rsa
jim
are
you
listening
tim
may
ps
i
reserve
the
right
to
retract
these
opinions
if
it
should
turn
out
that
rsa
data
security
was
involved
