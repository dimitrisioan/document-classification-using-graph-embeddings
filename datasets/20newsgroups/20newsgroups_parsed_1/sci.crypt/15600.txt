thousands

do
some
arithmetic
please
skipjack
has
possible
keys
lets
assume
a
bruteforce
engine
like
that
hypothesized
for
des
microsecond
per
trial
million
chips
thats
trials
per
second
or
about
years
for
trials
well
maybe
they
can
get
chips
running
at
one
trial
per
nanosecond
and
build
a
machine
with
million
chips
sure
only
years
for
each
solution
but
there
is
a
much
more
pernicious
problem
with
the
scheme
as
proposed
building
a
brute
force
machine
to
test
possible
keys
if
you
have
the
other
half
from
one
escrow
agent
is
easy
one
chip
one
test
per
microsecond
gives
you
one
break
every
two
weeks
and
that
break
gives
you
all
messages
involving
that
phone
the
xor
scheme
so
that
the
files
from
one
escrow
agent
gives
you
nothing
is
an
improvement
but
notice
that
xoring
with
truely
random
bit
strings
allows
for
an
arbitrary
number
of
escrow
agents
using
for
xor
sk
for
the
escrowed
key
and
a
and
b
for
two
random
bit
strings
hand
skab
ska
and
skb
to
three
escrow
agents
it
is
possible
to
come
with
an
encoding
scheme
to
match
any
escrow
pattern
for
example
of
such
that
fewer
cooperating
escrow
agents
gives
the
cracking
agency
no
benefit
