re
once
tapped
your
code
is
no
good
any
more
in
sez
do
the
police
normally
reveal
every
tap
they
do
even
if
no
charges
are
laid
in
many
ways
it
would
be
a
positive
step
if
they
had
to
judges
set
time
limits
on
warrants
i
assume
under
the
relevant
federal
law
usc
sec
d
the
authorizing
judge
must
notify
the
targets
within
days
after
the
tap
period
with
extensions
expires
this
is
the
normal
practice
of
course
no
wiretap
law
would
be
complete
without
the
unless
clause
which
in
subsection
d
reads
like
this
on
an
ex
parte
showing
ie
by
the
govt
without
opposition
since
that
would
obviously
involve
notice
to
the
targets
of
good
cause
to
a
judge
of
competent
jurisdiction
the
serving
of
the
inventory
required
by
this
subsection
the
order
itself
dates
of
interception
etc
may
be
postponed
emphasis
added
followups
directed
to
a
few
select
groups
moral
always
choose
the
right
sort
of
parents
before
you
start
in
to
be
rough
