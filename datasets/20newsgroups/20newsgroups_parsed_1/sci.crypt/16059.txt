i
heard
somewhere
cant
name
the
source
that
tempest
does
not
necessarily
pickup
just
crts
but
it
can
pick
up
emissions
from
almost
any
chip
if
that
is
true
the
kind
monitor
would
not
make
any
difference
becuase
everything
on
the
screen
can
be
pickedup
from
the
video
controller
can
anybody
verify
or
refute
this
as
anyone
who
attended
hohocon
will
attest
you
can
pick
information
off
the
video
chip
its
surprisingly
easy
too
the
guy
did
it
with
a
portable
tv
with
very
minor
mods
it
only
worked
from
feet
but
then
it
was
just
a
demonstration
ra
rogue
agentsod
the
nsa
is
now
funding
research
not
only
in
cryptography
but
in
all
areas
of
advanced
mathematics
if
youd
like
a
circular
describing
these
new
research
opportunities
just
pick
up
your
phone
call
your
mother
and
ask
for
one
