in
article
writes
and
since
the
us
constitutions
guarantees
the
right
to
every
american
to
bear
arms
why
is
not
every
american
entitled
as
a
matter
of
have
you
read
the
applicable
part
of
the
constitution
and
interpreted
it
in
context
if
not
please
do
so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individuals
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
read
the
constitution
yourself
the
second
amendment
says
the
right
to
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
so
a
well
regulated
militia
may
be
more
easily
formed
i
have
an
interpretation
of
the
second
that
shows
there
are
no
qualifications
to
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
if
you
want
i
can
email
