cocacola
has
always
understood
it
cocacola
is
made
under
licence
in
dozens
of
countries
around
the
world
youre
crazy
if
you
think
pepsico
doesnt
know
the
recipe
in
all
those
countries
cocacola
is
distributed
in
a
form
of
concentrate
what
the
local
producers
simply
mix
with
water
and
other
simple
ingredients
the
trick
is
to
know
what
is
in
the
concentrate
i
dont
know
if
this
is
still
true
but
at
one
time
cocacola
took
elaborate
measures
to
keep
the
formula
secret
for
instance
several
plants
in
different
cities
each
made
one
of
six
partial
concentrates
which
were
then
shipped
backand
forth
and
remixed
in
a
complicated
scheme
so
that
no
single
plant
made
the
whole
formula
by
now
i
would
guess
that
pepsicos
chemists
would
have
reverseengineered
it
cant
be
all
that
exotic
actually
i
prefer
pepsi
anyhow
in
about
minutes
im
gon
na
put
money
into
a
pepsi
vending
machine
