guess
we
will
have
to
wait
for
the
time
in
the
far
future
when
everyone
uses
such
good
crypto
that
the
nsa
has
no
job
then
the
agency
will
be
disbanded
and
its
files
opened
after
the
approprate
historical
delay
youve
overlooked
a
fundamental
truth
both
headcount
and
budget
of
any
government
agency
are
monotonic
increasing
functions
given
that
truth
you
need
to
look
for
what
the
agency
can
do
to
occupy
all
those
people
and
spend
all
that
money
when
crypto
is
unbreakable
perhaps
they
could
talk
the
worlds
telephone
companies
into
making
equipment
they
could
break
into
and
tap
maybe
they
could
convince
people
that
distributed
computing
was
a
good
idea
so
that
even
the
internal
state
of
a
process
would
be
available
for
access
by
wiretapping
maybe
disclaimer
all
opinions
expressed
are
my
own
of
course
