text
of
white
house
announcement
and
qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
in
article
hal
finney
writes
the
key
question
is
whether
nonclipper
encryption
will
be
made
illegal
it
seems
pretty
obvious
that
it
will
be
made
illegal
if
very
loud
noise
is
not
made
about
this
immediately
to
congress
and
the
house
it
looks
like
the
worst
nightmares
raised
by
dorothy
dennings
proposals
are
coming
true
if
the
government
continues
on
this
course
i
imagine
that
we
will
see
strong
cryptography
made
illegal
encryption
programs
for
disk
files
and
email
as
well
as
software
to
allow
for
encrypted
voice
communications
will
be
distributed
only
through
the
underground
people
will
have
to
learn
how
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
are
protecting
their
privacy
i
dont
know
whats
worse
the
waste
of
money
or
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
all
clintons
rhetoric
to
the
contrary
this
is
a
feeble
attempt
by
a
large
group
of
bored
intelligence
bureaucrats
to
justify
their
currently
useless
jobs
clinton
said
he
was
going
to
trim
the
fat
from
the
government
this
doesnt
look
very
dietetic
to
me
as
i
said
before
in
this
group
drug
dealing
and
terrorism
both
tend
to
be
international
crimes
which
are
not
going
to
cease
if
the
us
starts
to
regulate
encryption
the
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
will
simply
go
to
other
countries
to
communicate
their
plans
and
will
still
carry
them
out
here
andor
wherever
else
this
is
not
the
solution
to
the
problem
they
try
to
invent
a
new
problem
by
saying
we
need
encryption
i
guess
its
a
good
thing
bill
gates
isnt
a
star
general
or
we
would
all
need
our
own
copies
of
msdos
too
right
und
vee
haff
vays
uff
findink
out
iff
you
are
usink
doctor
dos
its
shocking
and
frightening
to
see
that
this
is
actually
happening
here
our
health
care
and
education
systems
are
in
the
toilet
and
they
come
up
with
this
pearl
if
this
goddamned
government
doesnt
get
a
clue
real
quick
and
start
trying
to
repair
the
infrastructure
of
the
country
rather
than
inventing
someone
to
blame
germany
and
japan
are
going
to
eat
the
us
alive
and
we
will
deserve
it
its
not
like
theres
any
shortage
of
real
problems
to
solve
guys
a
clipper
chip
is
really
going
to
help
the
homeless
a
clipper
chip
is
really
going
to
help
educate
the
children
in
the
ghettos
of
our
cities
just
think
of
the
generation
gap
that
can
be
developed
when
they
rehire
dod
engineer
dad
to
work
on
clipper
chips
that
will
be
used
to
decrypt
