i
wouldnt
think
so
asking
people
to
trust
a
secret
algorithm
seems
unsound
to
me
maybe
so
but
its
quite
common
there
are
millions
of
macintosh
users
who
have
no
idea
whats
in
apples
patented
roms
many
have
modems
connected
how
do
you
know
all
your
business
secrets
arent
being
stolen
answer
because
you
trust
apple
because
if
any
such
attempt
however
sophicsticated
came
out
it
would
destroy
apples
credibility
forever
then
theres
also
because
its
not
secret
if
i
want
to
i
can
go
look
at
apples
copyrighted
roms
in
a
mac
so
theyre
not
keeping
any
secrets
you
dont
even
have
to
pry
the
top
off
the
chip
and
use
an
electron
microscope
you
just
have
to
read
the
data
in
memory
and
see
if
you
can
figure
out
what
it
means
motorola
object
code
isnt
all
that
obscure
yes
its
copyrighted
so
i
cant
go
selling
copies
or
using
the
copy
myself
but
i
can
see
it
and
disassemble
it
theyre
not
asking
me
to
trust
their
honesty
theyre
asking
me
to
trust
the
quality
of
their
assembly
language
programming
but
i
can
see
for
myself
what
the
performance
price
and
crashesday
are
nsa
an
organization
not
known
for
its
honesty
or
openness
is
asking
me
to
trust
them
with
my
privacy
but
they
wont
trust
me
