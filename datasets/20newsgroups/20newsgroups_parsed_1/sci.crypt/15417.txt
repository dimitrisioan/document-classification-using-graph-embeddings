some
corrections

this

reposted
with

two
requests
first
note
the
roles
of
s
and
s
it
appears
to
me
and
others
that
anyone
who
knows
those
values
can
construct
the
unit
key
and
the
nature
of
the
generation
process
for
k
and
k
is
such
that
neither
can
be
produced
alone
thus
the
scheme
can
not
be
implemented
such
that
one
repository
generates
the
first
halfkey
and
another
generates
the
second
that
is
ominous
second
these
postings
are
not
revealed
scripture
nor
are
they
carefullycrafted
spook
postings
dont
attempt
to
draw
out
hidden
meanings
as
opposed
to
say
the
official
announcements
of
clipper
leave
denning
out
of
this
given
hellmans
record
of
opposition
to
des
which
goes
back
before
some
folks
on
this
newsgroup
knew
how
to
read
i
dont
think
you
can
impugn
his
integrity
oh
yeah
the
folks
who
invented
clipper
arent
stupid
if
you
think
something
doesnt
make
sense
its
almost
certainly
because
you
dont
understand
their
goals
this
is
an
addition

re
clipper
chip
i
just
had
another
conversation
with
nsa
to
clarify
some
of
the
features
of
clipper
please
feel
free
to
distribute
this
and
my
other
messages
on
clipper
the
name
of
the
encryption
algorithm
is
skipjack
martin
hellman
had
written
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
added
to
produce
a
three
part
message
which
will
then
be
encrypted
under
the
system
key
sk
producing
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
to
which
i
responded
my
understanding
is
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
was
correct
in
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
however
skipjack
being
a
singlekey
system
there
is
of
course
not
a
separate
decrypt
key
for
the
family
key
sk
the
unit
key
also
called
the
chip
key
is
generated
from
the
serial
number
n
as
follows
let
n
n
and
n
be
bit
blocks
derived
from
n
and
let
s
and
s
be
two
bit
seeds
used
as
keys
compute
the
bit
block
r
eden
s
s
s
note
that
this
is
like
using
the
des
in
triple
encryption
mode
with
two
keys
similarly
compute
blocks
r
and
r
starting
with
n
and
n
im
unlear
about
whether
the
keys
s
and
s
change
the
fact
that
theyre
called
seeds
suggests
they
might
then
r
r
and
r
are
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
form
k
and
the
next
bits
form
k
the
remaining
bits
are
discarded
the
seeds
s
and
s
do
not
change
the
whole
process
is
performed
on
a
laptop
computer
and
s
and
s
are
supplied
by
two
independent
people
so
that
no
one
person
knows
both
the
same
s
and
s
are
used
during
an
entire
programming
session
to
generate
keys
for
a
stream
of
serial
numbers
everything
is
discarded
at
the
end
the
computer
could
be
thrown
out
if
desired
the
serial
number
is
bits
and
the
values
n
n
and
n
are
formed
by
padding
the
serial
number
with
fixed
bit
blocks
separate
padding
for
each
value
the
resulting
keys
k
and
k
are
output
onto
separate
floppy
disks
paired
up
with
their
serial
number
each
pair
is
stored
in
a
separate
file
the
floppy
disks
are
taken
away
by
two
separate
people
on
behalf
of
the
two
escrow
agencies

i
am
sure
more
technical
detail
will
be
known
when
time
goes
by
please
remark
that
in
posting
this
i
do
not
automatically
agree
with
its
contents
and
implications
so
dont
swamp
my
mailbox
i
just
think
this
is
an
valuable
addition
to
the
less
than
technical
discussion
that
is
rising
here
and
no
i
dont
mind
if
you
call
s
and
s
backdoor
as
i
could
imagine
the
keygeneration
process
working
without
these
seeds
and
the
dependency
of
kk
from
the
serialnumber
