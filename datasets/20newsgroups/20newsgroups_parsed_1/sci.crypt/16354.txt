what
if
clipper
is

that

what

its
not

difficult
to
tell
that
a
msg
was
clipper
encrypted
even
if
you
cant
tell
the
contents
in
that
case
anyone
who
is
trying
to
hide
behind
anther
encryption
scheme
will
stand
out
from
all
of
the
other
traffic
and
raise
a
red
flag
to
the
nsa
etc
i
think
the
obvious
answer
which
may
have
been
posted
but
i
havent
seen
it
is
to
encrypt
your
data
with
some
other
scheme
then
run
it
through
clipper
the
only
way
the
police
will
be
able
to
detect
the
other
encryption
is
through
a
wiretap
so
even
if
they
do
notice
with
an
illegal
wiretap
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
a
judge
issuing
a
warrant
for
a
search
to
confiscate
the
illegal
scheme
assuming
that
at
one
day
it
comes
to
this
a
worse
case
based
on
an
illegal
wiretap
then
again
maybe
i
am
an
idealist
