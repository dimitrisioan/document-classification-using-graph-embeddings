c
may
writes
but
is
it
any
worse
than
the
current
unsecure
system
it
becomes
much
worse
of
course
if
the
government
then
uses
this
clinton
clipper
to
argue
for
restrictions
on
unapproved
encryption
this
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
us
i
think
the
camels
nose
in
the
tent
etc
excuse
me

has
already
happened
theres
a
couple
of
humps
in
the
tent
already
ask
the
folks
at
qualcomm
what
became
of
the
nontrivial
encryption
scheme
they
proposed
for
use
in
their
cdma

cellular
phone
standard
