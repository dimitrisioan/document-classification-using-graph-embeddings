instead
we
have
a
deliberately
braindead
version
of
a
cryptosystem
that
has
not
even
been
peer
reviewed

i
dont
even
think
of
clipper
as
encryption
in
any
real
senseif
i
did
id
probably
be
a

more
annoyed
about
it
heh
heh
the
government
already
gave
it
up
for
us
remember
in
the
announcement
they
described
this
scheme
as
balancing
the
two
extremes
of
having
no
privacy
and
claiming
that
citizens
had
a
constitutional
right
to
encryption
thats
not
for
clinton
or
anyone
under
him
to
say
though
only
the
federal
and
supreme
courts
can
say
anything
about
the
constitutionality
anything
the
administration
or
any
governmental
agency
says
is
opinion
