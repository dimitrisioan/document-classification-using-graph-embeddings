re
lets
build
software
cryptophones
for
over
the
internet
hmmm
celp
takes
up
about
mips
for
full
duplex
and
has
been
implemented
on
about
a
million
dsp
chips
the
card
in
my
pc
only
cost
about
and
im
sure
once
demand
goes
up
the
prices
would
drop
the
analog
devices
board
that
were
looking
at
now
cost
about
academic
price
i
dont
think
hardware
is
something
to
worry
about
if
you
get
it
working
people
will
snap
up
internet
phone
cards
like
there
was
no
tomorrow
what
we
need
here
is
a
good
implementation
of
celp
the
government
code
is
absolute
crap
i
got
a
speedup
after
looking
at
it
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
modifications
to
pgp
to
allow
it
to
compressdecompress
bit
frames
every
msec
i
think
the
ad
should
have
enough
juice
for
this
mips
as
part
of
the
project
im
working
on
now
were
trying
to
get
celp
up
and
running
in
realtime
full
duplex
mode
i
got
ta
find
the
source
to
pgp
and
see
how
tough
it
would
be
to
integrate
the
endecryption
parts
into
the
code
ill
play
with
it
anyone
else
out
there
got
an
ad
setup
