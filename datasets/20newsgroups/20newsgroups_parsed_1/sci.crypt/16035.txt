clipper
also
allows
an
extraordinary
opportunity
for
the
criminal
to
conceal
use
of
superencryption
an
automated
fullsystem
surveillance
mechanism
quite
feasible
across
radio
bandwidth
which
knows
family
key
f
can
validate
clipper
wrappers
and
nesn
associations
but
it
can
not
reveal
in
realtime
the
use
of
superencryption
unless
it
knows
all
unit
keys
which
we
are
being
assured
are
only
to
be
made
available
in
two
separate
pieces
upon
specific
wiretaplike
order
the
serial
number
will
be
in
a
bit
block
with
a
bit
filler
doesnt
take
a
lot
to
check
to
see
if
that
is
correct
yes
but
the
extra
encryption
could
be
applied
before
the
message
is
encrypted
by
the
clipper
so
that
the
wrapper
would
be
fine
the
phones
serial
number
and
the
session
key
would
be
in
the
lawenforcement
field
etc
but
the
message
wouldnt
be
readable
even
if
the
particular
clippers
key
were
obtained
from
the
escrow
agents
in
fact
it
shouldnt
even
be
possible
to
detect
that
a
message
has
been
doubleencrypted
without
a
court
order
right
