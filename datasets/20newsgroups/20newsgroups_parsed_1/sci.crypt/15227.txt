re
how
to
detect
use
of
an
illegal
cipher
how
can
the
government
tell
which
encryption
method
one
is
using
without
being
able
to
decode
the
traffic
ie
in
order
to
accuse
me
of
using
an
unauthorized
strong
encryption
technique
they
would
have
to
take
both
keys
out
of
escrow
run
them
against
my
ciphertext
and
draw
a
blank
i
was
thinking
about
this
also
its
quite
possible
the
system
transmits
in
clear
the
serial
number
of
the
device
being
used
that
way
they
can
start
a
tap
get
the
serial
number
and
use
the
warrant
for
the
first
tap
to
get
the
key
if
they
tap
someone
whos
apparently
using
encryption
but
dont
find
that
prefix
then
theyll
assume
its
an
unauthorized
encryption
scheme
this
doesnt
handle
superencrypted
traffic
if
the
clipper
doesnt
impose
any
unfortunate
performance
sideeffects
theres
no
reason
not
to
use
it
to
superencrypt
a
stream
of
tripledes
encrypted
traffic
that
way
your
traffic
looks
normal
and
perhaps
anyone
desiring
to
listen
in
wont
even
bother
since
they
know
nobodys
going
to
really
trust
crypto
that
has
classified
internals
for
important
stuff
