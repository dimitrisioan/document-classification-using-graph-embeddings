writes
in
most
cases
information
you
come
by
properly
is
yours
to
use
as
you
wish
but
there
are
certainly
exceptions
if
you
write
a
paper
which
includes
sufficiently
detailed
information
on
how
to
build
a
nuclear
weapon
it
is
classified
as
i
understand
the
law
nuclear
weapons
design
is
automatically
classified
even
if
you
do
the
work
yourself
i
believe
you
are
then
not
allowed
to
read
your
own
paper
this
has
now
been
thrown
out
by
the
courts
the
progressive
case
a
less
serious
example
if
you
tell
drivers
about
a
speed
trap
they
are
about
to
run
into
you
can
be
fined
even
though
you
might
argue
that
you
broke
no
law
when
you
discovered
the
location
of
the
policeman
the
charge
is
interfering
with
a
police
officer
which
is
quite
similar
what
you
would
be
doing
by
reverse
engineering
the
clipper
chip
this
is
outright
illegal
it
does
violate
the
first
amendment
if
you
would
give
a
case
in
which
your
speed
trap
example
has
been
upheld
by
the
courts
