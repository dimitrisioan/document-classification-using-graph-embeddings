implementing
a
diffiehellman
key
exchange
i
want
to
add
link
encryption
to
a
module
that
multiplexes
upper
level
routines
into
a
single
data
link
the
upper
levels
wont
know
about
this
and
thus
key
exchange
shall
only
need
to
occur
once
at
the
initial
link
establishment
i
figure
that
i
can
do
this
with
des
and
a
diffiehellman
key
exchange
is
using
a
diffiehellman
exchange
to
establish
a
bit
des
key
acceptable
in
other
words
what
are
the
pros
and
cons
of
such
a
setup
are
there
any
important
issues
to
watch
out
for
aside
from
filtering
out
unacceptable
keys
and
in
order
to
achieve
this
i
guess
i
will
need
to
use
bit
math
routines
for
probable
prime
number
calculation
exponentiation
etc
so
could
someone
point
me
towards
a
good
package
this
is
strictly
noncommercial
matthew
the
power
of
one
man
seems
like
a
small
squirt
