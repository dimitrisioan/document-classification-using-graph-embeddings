existence
of
the
keyregistry
system
seems
to
make
possible
all
kinds
of
possible
attacks
at
a
small
fraction
of
the
expense
of
trying
to
build
say
a
des
keysearch
machine
as
originally
described
it
sounded
like
any
police
court
combination
could
acquire
the
key
for
a
given
chip
i
hope
thats
not
the
case
since
it
would
imply
a
glaring
hole
how
much
does
it
cost
to
find
one
crooked
jodge
and
one
crooked
cop
especially
for
a
foreign
intelligence
agency
or
organized
crime
boss
however
even
if
more
intelligent
schemes
are
used
to
allow
access
to
the
unencrypted
phone
conversations
there
will
be
weak
nesses
they
may
be
very
expensive
and
very
difficult
but
who
would
trust
hisher
confidential
information
to
an
encryption
scheme
that
for
say
could
by
cracked
one
time
in
a
hundred
des
for
all
the
complaints
about
a
bit
key
would
probably
cost
several
million
dollars
to
build
a
keysearch
machine
for
i
can
buy
a
des
keysearch
machine
off
the
shelf
now
for
approx
k
but
it
is
not
sold
by
that
name
go
buy
a
circuit
emulation
machine
eg
quickturn
containing
a
bunch
of
fpgas
say
to
s
and
program
each
to
be
a
des
search
engine
lets
say
chips
running
at
mhz
g
testssec
time
is
e
sec
max
weeks
weeks
average
cant
wait
that
long
buy
a
bigger
machine
