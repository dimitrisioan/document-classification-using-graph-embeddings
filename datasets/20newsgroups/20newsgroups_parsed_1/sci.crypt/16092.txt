well
that
explains
it
the
government
has
no
real
need
to
spy
on
people
who
already
love
big
brother
its
the
people
who
are
inclined
to
talk
back
who
need
to
be
watched
though
i
think
this
an
overstatement
it
does
contain
a
grain
of
truth
its
drug
dealers
spies
terrorists
and
organized
crime
figures
assuming
enough
probable
cause
to
convince
a
judge
who
need
to
be
watched
not
lawabiding
citizens
and
thus
cointelpro
in
which
horrible
people
who
threatened
the
republic
by
disagreeing
with
the
government
were
systematically
kept
track
of
for
years
