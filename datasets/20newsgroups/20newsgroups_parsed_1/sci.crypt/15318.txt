subject
is
there
any
security
in
the
clipper
it
seems
to
me
that
all
discussions
about
clipper
security
are
almost
irrelevant
if
i
can
not
choose
the
key
but
have
to
use
a
key
chosen
for
me
by
the
foundry
the
security
of
the
whole
universe
of
users
is
as
good
or
as
bad
as
the
security
of
vlsi
technologies
inc
it
is
a
trivial
effort
to
run
any
ciphertext
agains
all
the
keys
ever
manufactured
after
all
we
are
talking
about
to
million
keys
that
will
ever
be
manufactured
the
key
depositories
can
be
as
secure
and
incorruptible
as
they
wish
to
be
nobody
cares
anyway
now
if
someone
would
convince
me
that
the
shipping
docks
of
vti
att
and
others
are
impenetrable
remember
the
chips
have
to
ship
with
the
key
you
or
the
dealer
are
going
to
submit
it
to
the
authorities
eventually
id
be
a
bit
happier
but
do
we
really
believe
that
the
various
governments
including
ours
wont
have
the
full
lists
of
all
the
keys
ever
manufactured
did
i
miss
something
here

own
