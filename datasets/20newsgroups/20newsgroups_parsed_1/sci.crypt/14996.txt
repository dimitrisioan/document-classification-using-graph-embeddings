this
actually
supports
bills
speculation
if
there
is
a
backdoor
in
rsaref
and
if
pkp
is
supported
secretly
by
the
nsa
then
it
is
more
than
natural
that
they
will
welcome
any
publickey
implementation
that
uses
rsaref
and
will
strongly
oppose
themselves
against
any
implementation
that
doesnt
my
speculation
does
not
include
or
depend
upon
a
trapdoor
in
rsaref
i
do
not
believe
that
rsa
would
consent
to
such
however
there
are
other
limitation
in
the
concept
of
rsaref
in
which
nsa
has
an
interest
it
has
an
interest
in
a
limited
number
of
implementations
ie
targets
it
has
an
interest
in
fixed
key
or
maximum
modulus
size
it
has
a
legitimate
literally
right
to
pursue
such
interests
within
bounds
it
probably
has
a
right
to
pursue
those
interests
by
covert
means
at
least
it
has
the
same
right
as
the
rest
of
us
not
to
disclose
all
of
its
motives
and
intentions
institutions
are
not
selfaware
they
do
not
know
their
intentions
in
any
meaningful
sense
