argh
this
is
what
i
get
for
acknowledging
david
sternlights
existence
in
article
david
sternlight
writes
though
i
think
this
an
overstatement
it
does
contain
a
grain
of
truth
its
drug
dealers
spies
terrorists
and
organized
crime
figures
assuming
enough
probable
cause
to
convince
a
judge
who
need
to
be
watched
not
lawabiding
citizens
okay
it
looks
like
i
am
going
to
have
to
do
the
history
lesson
after
all
during
the
vietnam
war
there
were
a
great
many
citizens
opposed
to
it
who
considered
themselves
perfectly
law
abiding
although
mr
nixon
and
his
lackeys
thought
otherwise
the
federal
government
had
no
compunction
about
adding
people
who
are
otherwise
decent
law
abiding
and
upstanding
but
disagree
with
us
to
your
nice
little
list
do
you
think
this
could
never
happen
again
note
that
i
am
not
speculating
about
what
the
government
could
do
but
discussing
the
sort
of
observation
including
but
not
limited
to
phone
tapping
that
the
government
put
its
citizens
under
during
a
time
of
national
tension
your
naivete
is
still
appalling
btw
i
mean
read
what
you
posted
again
how
are
we
to
differentiate
between
good
people
and
bad
people
answer
a
priori
we
cant
we
have
to
assume
now
which
way
do
we
assume
do
we
assume
a
priori
that
a
citizen
is
lawabiding
or
rather
a
potential
communistdruglordchildabusercultmessiah
one
of
the
things
thats
supposedly
great
about
america
is
the
freedoms
enjoyed
by
citizens
who
are
presumed
to
be
lawabiding
until
proven
otherwise
