clipper
considered
harmful
in
article
steven
bellovin
writes
that
is
the
cops
send
the
lef
to
the
fholder
the
fholder
strips
off
f
and
sends
ukn
to
the
escrow
agents
they
send
either
u
or
k
to
the
cops
don
says
u
i
say
k
the
cops
cant
use
u
in
the
future
because
they
cant
strip
off
f
the
fholder
never
sees
u
in
dons
model
the
escrow
agents
cant
read
the
traffic
because
they
dont
have
k
in
my
model
they
have
k
but
not
the
message
itself
and
i
trust
that
more
because
i
think
the
cops
and
the
fbi
the
fholder
are
more
likely
to
collaborate
on
breaking
the
rules
the
net
result
is
that
by
involving
the
fholder
and
the
escrow
agents
on
every
tap
we
can
avoid
extending
permission
to
tap
ive
been
reading
this
board
passively
for
a
while
now
and
find
the
subject
absolutely
fascinating
especially
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
civil
rights
nut
like
myself
my
problem
is
that
im
new
to
the
field
and
paragraphs
like
the
above
keep
popping
up
im
sure
what
mr
bellovin
is
writing
about
is
both
fascinating
and
important
but
i
have
no
idea
what
it
means
anyway
im
keen
to
learn
and
will
read
anything
i
can
get
my
hands
on
that
explains
this
stuff
in
lay
terms
i
have
a
decent
cs
background
but
not
a
huge
amount
of
hyperadvanced
math
can
anyone
point
me
to
a
faq
or
a
decent
source
of
information
about
the
guts
of
current
cryptography
and
maybe
a
little
history
as
well
i
read
the
piece
in
this
months
wired
can
anyone
tell
me
how
much
i
should
trust
the
references
they
suggest
thanks
in
advance

kiss

the
night
before
