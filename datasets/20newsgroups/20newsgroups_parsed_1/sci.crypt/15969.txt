just
curious
how
would
the
clipper
chip
system
handle
conference
calls
its
not
clipper
its
any
encryption
system
ive
seen
a
number
of
designs
they
generally
involve
a
multiline
cleartext
bridge
depending
on
the
encryption
system
so
long
as
everyone
has
the
same
key
it
can
be
done
for
example
i
was
using
vat
which
is
an
internet
audio
tool
for
a
conference
call
and
we
were
encrypting
the
session
unfortunately
one
site
was
doing
more
work
and
didnt
have
the
cpu
for
it
so
it
didnt
sound
all
that
good
at
a
different
site
so
you
dont
neccessarily
have
to
have
a
cleartext
bridge
but
if
you
do
its
totally
internal
to
one
of
the
sites
involved
in
the
conversation
