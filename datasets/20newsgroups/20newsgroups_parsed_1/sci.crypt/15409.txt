re
why
the
clipper
algorithm
is
secret
in
article
john

writes
it
just
occurred
to
me
why
the
algorithm
is
secret
if
it
were
published
one
could
then
build
physically
identical
clone
versions
of
the
chip
that
would
interoperate
with
official
clipper
chips
but
the
cloner
wouldnt
provide
the
keys
to
the
escrow
houses
hmmn
not
necessarily
they
could
release
the
details
of
the
algorithm
without
releasing
the
system
key
called
sk
by
hellman
that
would
make
most
people
happy
and
with
some
sort
of
verification
procedure
before
key
exchange
the
official
chips
would
only
work
with
other
official
chips
in
other
words
secrecy
of
sk
makes
physically
identical
clone
versions
impossible
secrecy
of
the
algorithm
shouldnt
be
necessary
of
course
revealing
the
algorithm
opens
them
up
to
attacks
on
sk
since
all
units
share
this
key
compromising
it
may
be
a
big
deal
personally
i
wouldnt
feel
too
comfortable
knowing
that
one
secret
bit
number
held
in
many
places
was
all
that
guaranteed
my
security
of
course
compromise
of
sk
doesnt
necessarily
mean
that
the
system
is
compromised
but
its
impossible
to
tell
whether
or
not
thats
true
with
a
secret
algorithm
incidentally
whats
to
keep
a
secret
algorithm
from
using
the
secret
sk
as
the
main
key
with
uk
being
only
marginally
important
then
a
court
order
for
uk
may
not
even
be
necessary
to
do
a
wiretap

the
reason
why
mathematics
enjoys
special
esteem
dept
of
computer
science
above
all
other
sciences
is
that
its
laws
are
duke
university
absolutely
certain
and
indisputable
while
those
of
all
durham
nc
other
sciences
are
to
some
extent
debatable
