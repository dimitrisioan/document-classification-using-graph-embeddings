subject
political
point
of
attack
clipper
infrastructure
my
earlier
argument
that
clipper
will
encourage
state
and
local
cops
to
commit
criminal
acts
is
largely
moot
now
that
weve
learned
that
the
fbi
will
perform
the
actual
tap
it
will
encourage
the
fbi
to
commit
even
more
criminal
acts
but
thats
not
the
point
here
but
this
gives
another
avenue
of
attack
on
the
clipper
proposal
when
the
effaclucpsr
foia
requests
are
made
they
should
ask
for
details
on
the
bureaucratic
and
equipment
infrastructure
that
is
proposed
or
even
already
budgeted
for
the
fbi
to
service
tapping
requests
for
now
and
the
projected
future
from
these
figures
estimate
the
number
of
clippertap
requests
the
fbi
is
expecting
publish
this
figure
compare
it
on
a
percapita
basis
with
the
amount
of
tapping
now
known
or
suspected
also
estimate
how
expensive
it
would
be
for
the
fbi
to
install
more
clippertapping
stations
and
how
rapidly
they
could
be
built
and
installed
ie
get
the
plus
or
minus
epsilon
for
the
near
future
might
be
a
mite
disturbing
for
j
q
public
to
know
these
things
and
despite
all
the
technical
details
btw
thanks
to
those
whove
been
providing
them
we
still
dont
know
how
the
tapping
requests
will
be
transmitted
and
authenticated
though
it
isnt
too
hard
to
guess
a
good
scheme
how
the
results
will
be
securely
transmitted
fed
ex
the
audio
tapes
how
privacy
will
be
reestablished
when
an
investigation
is
