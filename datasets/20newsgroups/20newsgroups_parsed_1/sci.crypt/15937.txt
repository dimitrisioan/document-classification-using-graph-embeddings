once
they
get
your
keys

lynn

writes
about
people
so
far
have
asked
once
the
fbi
gets
your
clipper
keys
wont
they
be
able
to
read
all
your
future
and
past
traffic
there
has
been
no
response
from
nist
nsa
ms
denning
mr
hellman
or
anyone
else
who
might
be
able
to
give
us
an
authoritative
answer
this
is
troubling
it
was
implied
in
the
first
technical
posting
by
dorothy
denning
that
the
fbi
would
do
the
decryption
for
the
law
enforcement
agencies
it
wasnt
clear
to
me
from
the
post
whether
this
would
be
done
in
realtime
or
not
or
whether
the
fbi
would
just
decrypt
the
session
keys
for
the
locals
or
would
do
the
whole
message
one
thing
im
a
bit
puzzled
by
why
arent
they
doing
this
with
a
public
key
scheme
of
some
sort
you
could
generate
two
uniqe
publicprivate
pairsor
for
each
chip
then
escrow
the
private
keys
with
the
escrow
agencies
set
the
protocol
up
to
encrypt
the
session
key
with
both
public
keys
to
decrypt
a
message
both
escrow
agencies
in
the
right
order
for
most
pk
schemes
have
to
decrypt
with
the
escrowed
private
key
this
way
there
wouldnt
be
thecconcern
that
once
the
police
had
asked
fo
a
warrantwiretap
they
would
have
your
key
