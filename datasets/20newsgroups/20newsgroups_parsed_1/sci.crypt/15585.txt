do
we
need
the
clipper
for
cheap
security

one
thing
that
clipper
offers
is
interoperability
at
a
higher
degree
of
security
than
we
currently
have
in
nonproprietary
voice
encryption
systems
this
means
it
will
be
cheaper
than
anyones
proprietary
scheme
and
easier
to
deploy
i
may
be
an
anarchist
nutcase
but
i
wouldnt
have
frothed
overmuch
had
the
government
proposed
a
secure
encryption
standard
in
fact
if
the
nsa
had
come
up
with
a
privacy
chip
rather
than
a
wiretap
chip
i
would
have
been
happy
they
could
have
done
this
set
up
an
ansi
committee
picked
a
secure
cryptosystem
defined
a
protocol
and
interface
and
said
hey
start
building
them
instead
we
have
a
deliberately
braindead
version
of
a
cryptosystem
that
has
not
even
been
peer
reviewed
yes
the
nsa
owns
some
smart
people
but
if
they
pulled
a
feal
well
att
is
going
to
be
left
with
a
lot
of
dud
phones
on
its
hands
perry
said
someone
please
tell
me
what
exactly
we
get
in
our
social
contract
in
exchange
for
giving
up
our
right
to
strong
cryptography
can
you
tell
me
where
exactly
we
have
given
up
that
right
heh
heh
the
government
already
gave
it
up
for
us
remember
in
the
announcement
they
described
this
scheme
as
balancing
the
two
extremes
of
having
no
privacy
and
claiming
that
citizens
had
a
constitutional
right
to
encryption
so
much

the
right
