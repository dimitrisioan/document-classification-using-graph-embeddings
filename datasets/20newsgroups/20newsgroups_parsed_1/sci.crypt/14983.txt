cryptanalysis
some
sick
part
of
me
really
liked
that
phrase
actually
merely
the
threat
of
a
long
prison
sentence
even
without
a
beating
can
get
most
people
to
give
in
especially
if
its
also
punctuated
with
a
trip
to
the
county
jail
where
one
just
happens
to
get
locked
up
with
all
the
drunkstonedcrazy
folks
that
are
too
violent
to
be
left
in
cells
with
other
people
