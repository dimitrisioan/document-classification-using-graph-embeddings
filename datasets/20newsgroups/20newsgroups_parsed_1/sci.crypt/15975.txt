ever
since
craig
rowland
posted
his
piece
new
encryption
to
scicrypt
there
has
been
some
discussion
of
our
company
secured
communications
technologies
inc
and
on
encryption
algorithm
nea
the
classic
comment
on
new
encryption
algorithms
comes
from
friedman
no
new
cypher
is
worth
considering
unless
it
comes
from
someone
who
has
already
broken
a
very
hard
one
historically
friedman
has
been
right
its
really
hard
to
develop
a
good
cypher
ibms
lucifer
the
precursor
to
des
turns
out
to
have
been
fatally
flawed
most
of
the
deslike
systems
other
than
des
seem
to
be
vulnerable
to
differential
cryptanalysis
the
first
two
tries
at
public
key
encryption
remember
knapsack
cyphers
were
broken
most
if
not
all
of
the
machine
cyphers
of
the
electromechanical
era
were
broken
eventually
attempts
in
the
computer
era
to
homebrew
encryption
have
been
disappointing
the
classic
a
survey
of
data
insecurity
packages
in
cryptologia
contains
analyses
and
breaking
techniques
for
a
few
of
the
popular
security
packages
of
the
late
s
a
new
proprietary
algorithm
no
way
if
the
us
is
permitting
general
export
of
this
thing
it
has
to
be
weak
thats
how
the
current
regulations
work
currently
theres
a
willingness
to
allow
systems
with
short
keys
bits
appears
to
be
no
problem
the
bits
of
des
are
too
many
or
weak
algorithms
i
think
word
perfect
qualifies
under
that
rule
to
be
exported
i
cant
believe
these
guys
shepherded
their
technique
through
the
pto
and
the
state
departments
arms
control
division
without
finding
that
out
john
nagle
ps
no
im
not
thrilled
with
clipper
either
but
thats
a
different
issue
