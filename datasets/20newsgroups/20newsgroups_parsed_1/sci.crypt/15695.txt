heres
a
simple
way
to
convert
the
clipper
proposal
to
an
unexceptionable
one
make
it
voluntary
that
isyou
get
high
quality
secure
nsa
classified
technology
if
you
agree
to
escrow
your
key
otherwise
you
are
on
your
own
thats
the
disturbing
part
use
of
other
products
is
voluntary
for
now
and
the
press
releases
talk
about
the
white
houses
unwillingness
to
decide
that
citizens
have
a
right
to
good
commercial
crypto
gear
and
about
how
commercial
alternatives
will
be
permitted
as
long
as
they
provide
key
escrow
services
thats
a
clear
implication
that
theyre
considering
banning
alternatives
additionally
use
of
real
alternatives
isnt
totally
legal
youre
not
allowed
to
export
really
good
crypto
equipment
except
to
the
governments
friends
eg
the
australian
government
you
can
only
export
even
bad
crypto
equipment
with
their
permission
and
the
regulators
who
control
the
cellular
telephone
companies
make
sure
there
are
only
two
competitors
so
joes
garage
cellular
cant
start
offering
a
secure
service
pray
for
peace
