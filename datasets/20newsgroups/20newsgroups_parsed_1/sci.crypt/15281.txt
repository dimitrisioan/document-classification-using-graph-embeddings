powerful

too
a
unix
tool
of
cryptographic
significance
is
available
for
anonymous
ftp
agrep
a

in

agrep
agrep
is
a
very
fast
fuzzy
search
tool
with
a
tremendous
number
of
powerful
search
options
the
one
most
obviously
applicable
to
cryptography
key
selection
is
to
be
able
to
specify
the
similarity
of
matches
in
the
data
for
example
say
you
make
up
a
passwordphrase
of
qimwel
of
course
you
rightly
suspect
that
this
key
itself
is
not
in
any
dictionary
or
word
list
but
how
close
is
it
to
en
entry
that
could
be
varied
by
some
crack
program
to
bruteforce
search
for
it
you
use
agrep
to
find
out
looking
with
argument
for
none
one
or
two
errors
no
matches
good
so
far
but
agrep
qimwel
bigwordandphraselist
finds
that
the
pattern
qimwel
is
too
close
to
the
pattern
imsel
part
of
himself
and
a
host
of
others
to
be
of
any
cryptographic
value
as
a
key
an
error
of
level
two
corresponds
to
a
simple
transposition
of
letters
like
teh
for
the
a
minimally
acceptable
password
would
have
to
pass
as
least
level
in
order
not
immediately
ruledout
as
even
a
remote
possibility
of
being
a
good
password
in
real
cryptographic
use
my
personal
passphrases
clear
at
least
level
on
my
rather
large
meg
word
and
phrase
lists
and
for
searching
for
key
words
in
humantyped
data
lots
o
typos
the
tool
is
unexcelled
for
example
for
example
say
i
want
to
find
out
what
people
think
about
gibsons
sf
book
neuromancer
in
the
huge
sflovers
archives
even
with
an
error
distance
specification
as
small
as
of
i
will
find
all
those
people
who
think
the
title
was
necromancer
or
other
common
typos
why
miss
anything
also
the
program
can
look
for
up
to
patterns
in
parallel
at
boyermoore
sublinear
speeds
great
for
a
nsa
wannabe
to
look
for
your
name
terrorists
names
special
tagalog
or
religious
words
etc
in
the
news
or
email
spool
directories
you
can
even
search
for
ciphertext
by
using
say
random
threebyte
combinations
and
eliminate
all
texts
that
dont
score
the
x
chisquare
birthday
hits
on
message
size
y
you
think
some
cryptoterrorist
is
try
to
foil
you
by
changing
the
pattern
on
you
no
problem
try
agrep
p
nsa
to
find
nsa
national
security
agency
nsecag
no
such
agency
national
scrabble
association
nsa
etc
you
can
also
specify
fixed
areas
looking
for
license
plate
xyz
when
you
know
that
the
letters
are
correct
you
might
say
agrep
xyz
licenseplatedatabase
will
find
all
plates
starting
with
xyz
with
up
to
two
errors
addition
substitution
deletion
in
the
number
area
you
can
also
weight
the
relative
cost
for
substiutions
additions
or
deletion
errors
for
example
when
searching
dna
patterns
for
a
particular
protein
combination
you
might
know
that
some
kinds
of
damage
cause
the
a
nucelotide
to
drop
out
more
than
other
errors
you
could
adjust
for
this
bias
by
setting
dc
where
you
set
the
deletion
cost
to
count
as
c
errors
a
steganographic
use
i
even
used
agrep
stegeograp
e
just
now
to
find
the
correct
spelling
would
be
to
intentionally
introduce
errors
of
a
certain
type
and
magnitude
into
a
plaintext
and
then
later
recover
the
orginal
it
via
an
agrep
pipe
lots
of
possibilities
here
when
only
outlaws
can
have
ciphertext
also
with
agreps
powerful
extraction
options
it
makes
it
easy
to
abstract
the
hits
into
a
useful
form
for
example
agrep
d
from
pgppassphrasezimmermannsa
says
output
the
entire
mail
record
delimited
by
from
that
contains
pgp
and
contains
either
passphrase
zimmerman
or
nsa
and
agrep
has
been
measured
an
orderofmagnitude
faster
than
the
secondbest
similarity
tool
publicly
available
as
usual
i
will
be
glad
to
email
the
source
and
docs
to
those
who
reqest
them
by
email
if
they
can
not
do
an
anonymous
ftp
get
this
now
it
is
too
powerful
to
stay
in
the
hands
of
the
nsa
grady
ward
vendor
to
the
nsa
and
proud
of
it
