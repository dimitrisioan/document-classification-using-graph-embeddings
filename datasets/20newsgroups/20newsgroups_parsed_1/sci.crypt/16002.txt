hell
just
set
up
a
spark
jammer
or
some
other
very
electricallynoisy
device
this
doesnt
work
due
to
the
nearfield
farfield
effect
you
may
stop
someone
five
yards
away
from
listening
in
but
someone
fifty
yards
away
will
be
relatively
unaffected
unless
you
pump
out
hundreds
of
watts
and
jam
all
the
neighbourhood
tvs
as
well
in
that
case
the
government
will
stomp
on
you
ask
any
radio
ham
democratic
governments
care
even
more
about
their
voters
right
to
watch
soap
operas
than
they
do
about
national
security
and
dictators
consider
their
propaganda
to
be
an
integral
part
of
their
national
security

another
idea
use
a
laptop
computer
as
mentioned
earlier
the
lcd
screen
is
a
lot
less
noisy
than
a
standard
crt
but
since
many
laptops
have
power
supplies
that
run
at
volts
instead
of
they
would
be
considerably
quieter
im
afraid
this
doesnt
work
either
we
can
pick
up
laptop
screens
without
any
problem
most
of
the
socalled
low
radiation
monitors
are
also
useless
the
description
turns
out
to
a
marketing
assertion
rather
than
an
engineering
one
we
thought
there
might
be
a
market
for
a
monitor
which
was
not
as
hugely
expensive
as
the
military
tempest
kit
but
which
was
well
enough
shielded
to
stop
eavesdropping
using
available
receivers
we
built
a
prototype
it
works
and
its
still
sitting
on
my
lab
bench
commercial
interest
was
exactly
zero
in
the
absence
of
open
standards
a
monitor
which
really
is
low
radiation
and
costs
dollars
more
cant
compete
against
a
monitor
which
just
claims
to
be
low
radiation
and
whose
only
extra
cost
of
production
is
the
pretty
blue
sticker
on
the
box
