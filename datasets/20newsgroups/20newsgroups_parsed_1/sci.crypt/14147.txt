what
is
ripem
ripem
is
a
program
which
performs
privacy
enhanced
mail
pem
using
the
cryptographic
techniques
of
rsa
and
des
it
allows
your
electronic
mail
to
have
the
properties
of
authentication
ie
who
sent
it
can
be
confirmed
and
privacy
ie
nobody
can
read
it
except
the
intended
recipient
ripem
was
written
primarily
by
mark
riordan
most
of
the
code
is
in
the
public
domain
except
for
the
rsa
routines
which
are
a
library
called
rsaref
licensed
from
rsa
data
security
inc
how
can
i
get
ripem
ripem
contains
the
library
of
cryptographic
routines
rsaref
which
is
considered
munitions
and
thus
is
exportrestricted
from
distribution
to
people
who
are
not
citizens
or
permanent
residents
of
the
us
or
canada
therefore
the
following
request
is
quoted
from
the
readme
file
please
do
not
export
the
cryptographic
code
in
this
distribution
outside
of
the
usa
or
canada
this
is
a
personal
request
from
me
the
author
of
ripem
and
a
condition
of
your
use
of
ripem
note
that
rsaref
is
not
in
the
public
domain
and
a
license
for
it
is
included
with
the
distribution
you
should
read
it
before
using
ripem
the
best
way
to
get
it
is
to
ask
a
friend
for
a
copy
since
this
will
reduce
the
load
on
those
sites
that
do
carry
it
not
to
mention
the
humans
that
run
them
naturally
this
requires
that
you
trust
the
friend
ripem
is
available
via
anonymous
ftp
to
citizens
and
permanent
residents
in
the
us
from
rsacom
cd
to
rsaref
and
read
the
readme
file
for
info
last
i
looked
this
site
contains
only
the
source
tree
and
does
not
contain
compiled
binaries
or
the
nice
mac
version
ripem
as
well
as
some
other
crypt
stuff
has
its
home
site
on
rpubclmsuedu
which
is
open
to
nonanonymous
ftp
for
users
in
the
us
and
canada
who
are
citizens
or
permanent
residents
to
find
out
how
to
obtain
access
ftp
there
cd
to
pubcrypt
and
read
the
file
gettingaccess
for
convenience
binaries
for
many
architectures
are
available
here
in
addition
to
the
full
source
tree
will
ripem
run
on
my
machine
probably
it
has
already
been
ported
to
msdos
and
most
flavors
of
unix
sunos
next
linux
aix
ultrix
solaris
etc
ports
to
macintosh
include
a
standard
unixstyle
port
and
a
rather
nice
maclike
port
written
by
raymond
lau
author
of
stuffit
more
ports
are
expected
and
help
of
users
is
invited
will
ripem
work
with
my
mailer
probably
how
easy
and
clean
the
effective
interface
is
will
depend
on
the
sophistication
and
modularity
of
the
mailer
though
the
users
guide
included
with
the
distribution
discusses
ways
to
use
ripem
with
many
popular
mailers
including
berkeley
mush
elm
and
mh
code
is
also
included
in
elisp
to
allow
easy
use
of
ripem
inside
gnu
emacs
if
you
make
a
new
interface
for
ripem
or
create
an
improvement
on
one
in
the
distribution
which
you
believe
is
convenient
to
use
secure
and
may
be
useful
to
others
feel
free
to
post
it
to
altsecurityripem
what
is
rsa
rsa
is
a
crypto
system
which
is
asymmetric
or
publickey
this
means
that
there
are
two
different
related
keys
one
to
encrypt
and
one
to
decrypt
because
one
can
not
reasonably
be
derived
from
the
other
you
may
publish
your
encryption
or
public
key
widely
and
keep
your
decryption
or
private
key
to
yourself
anyone
can
use
your
public
key
to
encrypt
a
message
but
only
you
hold
the
private
key
needed
to
decrypt
it
note
that
the
message
sent
with
rsa
is
normally
just
the
des
key
to
the
real
message
see
what
is
des
note
that
the
above
only
provides
for
privacy
for
authentication
the
fingerprint
of
the
message
see
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
md
is
encrypted
with
the
senders
private
key
the
recipient
can
use
the
senders
public
key
to
decrypt
it
and
confirm
that
the
message
must
have
come
from
the
sender
rsa
was
named
for
the
three
men
rivest
shamir
and
adleman
who
invented
it
to
find
out
more
about
rsa
ftp
to
rsacom
and
look
in
pubfaq
or
look
in
scicrypt
what
is
des
des
is
the
data
encryption
standard
a
widely
used
symmetric
or
secretkey
crypto
system
unlike
rsa
des
uses
the
same
key
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
messages
however
des
is
much
faster
than
rsa
ripem
uses
both
des
and
rsa
it
generates
a
random
key
and
encrypts
your
mail
with
des
using
that
key
it
then
encrypts
that
key
with
the
recipients
public
rsa
key
and
includes
the
result
in
the
letter
allowing
the
recipient
to
recover
the
des
key
des
is
sometimes
considered
weak
because
it
is
somewhat
old
and
uses
a
key
length
considered
too
short
by
modern
standards
however
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
against
an
opponent
smaller
than
a
large
corporation
or
government
agency
it
is
not
unlikely
that
future
ripems
will
strengthen
the
symmetric
cipher
possibly
by
using
multiple
encryption
with
des
what
is
pem
and
how
does
ripem
relate
pem
is
privacy
enhanced
mail
a
system
for
allowing
easy
transfer
of
encrypted
electronic
mail
it
is
described
in
rfcs
these
documents
have
been
approved
and
obsolete
the
old
rfcs
ripem
is
not
really
a
complete
implementation
of
pem
because
pem
specifies
certificates
for
authenticating
keys
which
ripem
does
not
handle
at
this
time
their
addition
is
planned
whats
this
about
distributing
and
authenticating
keys
for
a
remote
user
to
be
able
to
send
secure
mail
to
you
she
must
know
your
public
key
for
you
to
be
able
to
confirm
that
the
message
received
came
from
her
you
must
know
her
public
key
it
is
important
that
this
information
be
accurate
if
a
bad
guy
convinces
her
that
his
key
is
in
fact
yours
she
will
send
messages
which
he
can
read
ripem
allows
for
three
methods
of
key
management
a
central
server
the
distributed
finger
servers
and
a
flat
file
all
three
are
described
in
the
ripem
users
guide
which
is
part
of
the
distribution
none
of
them
provide
perfect
security
why
do
all
ripem
public
keys
look
very
similar
ripem
public
keys
begin
with
a
pkcs
identifier
describing
various
characteristics
about
the
key
so
the
first
bunch
of
characters
in
your
key
may
be
the
same
as
those
of
lots
of
other
peoples
keys
this
does
not
mean
your
keys
are
similar
but
only
that
they
are
the
same
class
of
key
were
generated
with
the
same
program
are
of
the
same
length
etc
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
md
md
is
a
message
digest
algorithm
produced
by
rsa
data
security
inc
it
provides
a
bit
fingerprint
or
cryptographically
secure
hash
of
the
plaintext
it
is
cryptographically
secure
because
it
is
not
possible
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
computation
to
produce
a
different
plaintext
which
produces
the
same
fingerprint
thus
instead
of
signing
the
entire
message
with
the
senders
private
key
only
the
md
of
the
message
needs
to
be
signed
for
authentication
md
is
sometimes
used
for
other
purposes
for
example
it
is
often
used
to
map
an
input
of
arbitrary
length
to
bits
of
data
as
a
passphrase
interpreter
or
cookie
generator
md
is
described
in
its
entirety
including
an
implementation
in
c
in
rfc
what
is
pgp
pgp
is
another
cryptographic
mail
program
called
pretty
good
privacy
pgp
has
been
around
longer
than
ripem
and
works
somewhat
differently
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
in
any
way
though
pgp
does
also
use
rsa
some
major
differences
between
pgp
and
ripem
pgp
has
more
key
management
features
particularly
for
users
without
a
direct
network
connection
ripem
conforms
to
the
pem
rfcs
and
thus
has
a
greater
probability
of
working
with
other
pem
software
pgp
makes
no
attempt
to
be
compatible
with
anything
other
than
pgp
in
fact
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
pgp
ripem
uses
rsaref
a
library
of
rsa
routines
from
rsa
data
security
inc
rsaref
comes
with
a
license
which
allows
noncommercial
use
pgp
uses
its
own
implementation
of
rsa
which
is
not
licensed
thus
pkp
the
firm
holding
the
us
patents
on
the
rsa
algorithm
claims
that
it
is
a
infringement
of
that
patent
to
make
use
or
sell
pgp
in
the
us
or
canada
in
acknowledgement
of
this
pgps
original
author
phil
zimmermann
says
in
the
documentation
in
fact
if
you
live
in
the
usa
and
you
are
not
a
federal
agency
you
shouldnt
actually
run
pgp
on
your
computer
because
public
key
partners
wants
to
forbid
you
from
running
my
software
pgp
is
contraband
both
pgp
and
ripem
are
exportrestricted
and
can
not
be
sent
outside
the
us
and
canada
however
pgp
already
exists
on
many
ftp
sites
in
europe
and
other
places
whether
you
use
pgp
or
ripem
or
whatever
the
documentation
to
pgp
is
recommended
reading
to
anyone
interested
in
such
issues
note
that
the
above
facts
both
regarding
patent
and
export
restrictions
are
somewhat
controversial
many
people
think
it
shouldnt
be
that
way
and
some
people
interpret
various
documents
differently
unfortunately
discussions
of
it
on
the
net
inevitably
seem
to
produce
more
heat
than
light
and
probably
belong
in
misclegalcomputing
see
disclaimer
what
about
rpem
rpem
stands
for
rabin
privacy
enhanced
mail
it
was
similar
to
ripem
but
used
a
publickey
cipher
invented
by
rabin
which
is
not
rsa
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
patent
on
rsa
it
was
written
by
mark
riordan
the
same
author
as
ripem
its
distribution
was
halted
when
contrary
to
the
beliefs
of
many
including
rabin
public
key
partners
pkp
claimed
that
their
patent
was
broad
enough
to
cover
any
publickey
cipher
whose
strength
rested
in
the
difficulty
of
factoring
products
of
large
primes
not
just
rsa
this
claim
is
not
universally
accepted
by
any
means
but
was
not
challenged
for
pragmatic
reasons
rpem
is
not
really
used
anymore
it
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
or
pgp
what
is
mime
mime
stands
for
multipurpose
internet
mail
extensions
and
is
described
in
rfc
you
can
find
out
about
it
in
the
newsgroup
compmailmime
how
pem
should
interact
with
mime
is
not
yet
entirely
clear
some
people
use
the
stopgap
solution
of
having
a
mime
type
applicationxripem
in
order
to
send
ripem
messages
as
mime
ones
i
hope
some
standards
will
emerge
draft
internet
documents
exist
on
the
matter
i
have
this
simple
way
to
defeat
the
security
of
ripem
you
may
wish
to
check
the
companion
post
ripemattacks
which
discusses
some
of
the
more
obvious
attacks
on
ripems
security
and
what
procedures
will
minimize
the
risk
ripems
main
weak
area
is
probably
key
distribution
