the
number
of
court
ordered
wire
taps
is
pretty
low
law
enforcement
has
to
present
pretty
good
evidence
to
get
even
that
limited
number
of
authorizations
thus
the
overwhelming
majority
of
conversations
are
neither
tapped
nor
recorded
by
the
government
and
for
that
to
happen
they
have
to
a
have
a
pretty
good
reason
with
evidence
b
use
this
sparingly
on
highest
priority
pretty
good
reasons
david
given
the
proposition
of
the
first
first
paragraph
the
conclusion
of
the
second
should
read
thus
the
overwhelming
majority
of
conversations
are
neither
tapped
nor
recorded
legally
by
the
government
which
completely
overturns
your
argument
to
not
see
this
requires
an
unbelievable
degree
of
stupidity
or
naivete
on
your
part
perhaps
its
time
for
you
to
own
up
and
say
which
spook
agency
you
work
for
