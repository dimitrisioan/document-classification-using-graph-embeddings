digital

this

ten
parts
of

the

are
mostly
independent
but
you
should
read
the
first

before
the
rest
we
dont
have
the

dont

what
is
a
oneway
hash
function
what
is
the
difference
between
public
private
secret
shared
etc
what
are
md
and
md
what
is
snefru
what
is
a
oneway
hash
function
a
typical
oneway
hash
function
takes
a
variablelength
message
and
produces
a
fixedlength
hash
given
the
hash
it
is
computationally
impossible
to
find
a
message
with
that
hash
in
fact
one
cant
determine
any
usable
information
about
a
message
with
that
hash
not
even
a
single
bit
for
some
oneway
hash
functions
its
also
computationally
impossible
to
determine
two
messages
which
produce
the
same
hash
a
oneway
hash
function
can
be
private
or
public
just
like
an
encryption
function
heres
one
application
of
a
public
oneway
hash
function
like
md
or
snefru
most
publickey
signature
systems
are
relatively
slow
to
sign
a
long
message
may
take
longer
than
the
user
is
willing
to
wait
solution
compute
the
oneway
hash
of
the
message
and
sign
the
hash
which
is
short
now
anyone
who
wants
to
verify
the
signature
can
do
the
same
thing
another
name
for
oneway
hash
function
is
message
digest
function
what
is
the
difference
between
public
private
secret
shared
etc
there
is
a
horrendous
mishmash
of
terminology
in
the
literature
for
a
very
small
set
of
concepts
when
an
algorithm
depends
on
a
key
which
isnt
published
we
call
it
a
private
algorithm
otherwise
we
call
it
a
public
algorithm
we
have
encryption
functions
e
and
decryption
functions
d
so
that
dem
m
for
any
message
m
we
also
have
hashing
functions
h
and
verification
functions
v
such
that
vmx
if
and
only
if
x
hm
a
publickey
cryptosystem
has
public
encryption
and
private
decryption
checksums
such
as
the
application
mentioned
in
the
previous
question
have
public
hashing
and
public
verification
digital
signature
functions
have
private
hashing
and
public
verification
only
one
person
can
produce
the
hash
for
a
message
but
everyone
can
verify
that
the
hash
is
correct
obviously
when
an
algorithm
depends
on
a
private
key
its
meant
to
be
unusable
by
anyone
who
doesnt
have
the
key
theres
no
real
difference
between
a
shared
key
and
a
private
key
a
shared
key
isnt
published
so
its
private
if
you
encrypt
data
for
a
friend
rather
than
for
your
eyes
only
are
you
suddenly
doing
sharedkey
encryption
rather
than
privatekey
encryption
no
what
are
md
and
md
md
and
md
are
message
digest
functions
developed
by
ron
rivest
definitions
appear
in
rfc
and
rfc
see
part
code
is
available
from
ftpmd
note
that
a
transcription
error
was
found
in
the
original
md
draft
rfc
the
corrected
algorithm
should
be
called
mda
though
some
people
refer
to
it
as
md
what
is
snefru
snefru
is
a
family
of
message
digest
functions
developed
by
ralph
merkle
snefru
is
an
round
