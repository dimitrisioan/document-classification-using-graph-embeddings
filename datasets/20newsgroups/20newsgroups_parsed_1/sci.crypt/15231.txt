i
share
many
of
the
concerns
expressed
by
some
i
find
the
proposal
less
threatening
than
many
others
since
right
now
most
americans
have
no
secure
telephony
and
any
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
leads
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
this
would
also
plug
up
the
security
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phones
oh
great
wonderful
news
nobody
can
listen
inexcept
the
feds
you
believe
that
the
feds
offer
the
least
threat
to
liberty
of
anyone
and
im
sure
i
do
too
glad
that
jerk
wont
be
tapping
my
phone
anymore
