how
does
it
really
work
was
re
text
of
white
house
announcement
and
qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
this
announcement
is
somewhat
disconcerting
it
doesnt
do
anything
evil
in
and
of
itself
but
bodes
badly
for
the
future
of
open
algorithms
and
standards
in
information
security
i
wont
start
panicking
untilunless
des
or
rsa
or
stuff
like
that
is
prohibited
but
im
a
little
anxious
no
doubt
it
wont
be
long
before
someone
posts
explaining
how
this
just
a
small
part
of
some
farranging
and
longlived
nsapkpirsfbiciahandguncontrolincclinton
conspiracy
to
subvert
freedom
democracy
and
mathematics
my
feeling
is
that
the
administration
probably
isnt
that
worried
about
things
like
des
and
rsa
and
pgp
and
ripem
since
theyll
never
be
used
by
a
group
much
wider
than
us
computer
geeks
the
fact
that
this
just
came
out
now
suggests
one
of
two
things
the
nsa
has
been
working
on
this
for
a
long
time
and
it
only
just
now
happened
to
be
ready
to
release
to
the
world
at
this
time
the
nsa
has
been
working
on
this
for
a
long
time
but
wasnt
able
to
get
the
bush
administration
to
go
along
with
this
plan
i
find
it
unlikely
that
this
would
have
been
because
of
a
sympathy
for
the
unescrowed
use
of
cryptography
more
likely
the
administration
felt
that
even
escrowed
secretalgorithm
and
for
all
we
know
trivially
breakable
cryptography
should
not
be
made
widely
available
thus
said
clipper
chip
announcement
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
the
majority
of
the
discussion
involving
this
clipper
chip
seems
to
pertain
to
the
encryption
of
telephone
conversations
does
anyone
know
if
that
means
this
chip
is
designed
to
work
primarily
with
analog
signals
the
language
sort
of
suggests
this
but
its
hard
to
say
the
main
thing
i
just
dont
get
is
whether
this
chip
implements
symmetric
or
asymmetric
cryptographic
techniques
anybody
know
im
guessing
symmetric
but
they
dont
get
very
clear
about
it
if
it
is
symmetric
how
is
it
useful
for
anything
other
than
linklevel
encryption
with
an
identical
chip
at
each
end
how
can
you
negotiate
a
persession
key
using
symmetric
cryptography
without
using
a
trusted
third
party
who
knows
your
key
or
does
it
even
use
a
persession
key
if
its
asymmetric
what
about
pkps
patents
which
they
claim
cover
all
methods
of
doing
asymmetric
cryptography
are
they
getting
royalties
or
is
hiding
infringement
the
real
reason
for
keeping
the
algorithm
secret
