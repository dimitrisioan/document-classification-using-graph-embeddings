at
the
company
i
worked
for
previously
i
received
a
file
that
was
des
encryped
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
weeks
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
only
took
two
days
to
crack
the
file
taking
this
at
face
value
though
it
seems
quite
dissonant
with
much
else
that
has
been
published
here
about
brute
force
des
cracking
unless
russell
was
lucky
with
respect
to
the
key
id
be
very
interested
in
whether
the
program
russell
used
is
available
in
whether
he
used
a
cleartext
recognition
algorithm
in
the
program
or
whether
he
had
to
examine
each
decryption
by
hand
in
whether
he
used
a
known
plaintext
attack
this
has
to
be
a
dictionary
attack
no
other
attack
makes
sense
this
means
that
whoever
encrypted
the
file
just
typed
some
password
which
was
a
single
dictionary
word
and
then
russell
tried
all
the
words
in
the
dictionary
this
isnt
too
implausible
especially
if
he
was
smart
and
clipped
the
first
plaintext
block
off
the
ciphertext
if
the
first
block
doesnt
decrypt
then
obviously
the
others
wont
either
assuming
one
attempt
a
second
it
takes
seven
hours
to
try
all
the
words
in
usrdictwords
not
real
tough
if
you
want
des
to
be
secure
you
have
to
use
random
keys
you
cant
just
type
your
wifes
name
and
think
aha
theyll
never
guess
