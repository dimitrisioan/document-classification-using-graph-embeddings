ive
recently
been
reading
a
paper
of
merkles
publixhed
only
on
the
net
i
think
discussing
three
potential
replacements
for
des
was
anyting
ever
done
with
these
are
khufu
khafre
andor
snefru
still
being
discussed
anywhere
i
know
snefru
is
referenced
in
the
rsa
faq
and
i
think
it
may
also
be
in
the
scicrypt
faq
on
a
related
topic
can
anyone
point
me
toward
good
sites
to
find
papersarticlesdiscussions
of
cryptology
i
think
ive
about
exhausted
the
mathsci
library
here
which
doesnt
seem
to
have
anything
more
recent
than
about
thanks

khufu
and
khafre
are
both
patented
biham
and
shamir
showed
that
differential
cryptanalysis
can
break
round
khafre
with
a
chosen
plaintext
attack
using
different
encryptions
khafre
with
rounds
can
be
broken
with
the
same
attack
using
different
encryptions
there
are
probably
more
efficient
differential
cryptanalytic
attacks
if
someone
wants
to
take
the
time
to
look
khufu
has
keydependent
sboxes
and
is
immune
to
differential
cryptanalysis
source
code
for
this
algorithm
and
khafre
are
in
the
patent
snefru
is
a
publicdomain
oneway
hash
function
the
version
of
snefru
that
produces
a
bit
hash
is
vulnerable
to
differential
cryptanalysis
vulnerable
means
that
the
attack
is
more
efficient
that
brute
force
for
four
passes
or
less
given
that
sha
and
md
are
much
more
efficient
oh
yes
anyone
interested
in
licensing
the
patent
should
contact
dave
petre

licencing
