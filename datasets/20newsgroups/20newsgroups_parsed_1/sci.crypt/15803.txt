remember
in
the
announcement
they
described
this
scheme
as
balancing
the
two
extremes
of
having
no
privacy
and
claiming
that
citizens
had
a
constitutional
right
to
encryption
so
much
for
clintons
support
of
the
right
of
privacy
theres
an
out
for
him
the
announcement
talked
about
strong
cryptography
i
believe
specifically
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
every
vendor
claims
his
product
is
unbreakable
so
this
was
sloppy
wording
i
am
not
claiming
that
we
private
citizens
should
have
access
to
the
nsas
best
secret
algorithms
i
dont
want
any
nsa
algorithms
actually
ill
let
them
break
my
pitiful
amateur
algorithms
and
rsas
all
i
want
is
what
i
have
already
the
ability
and
right
to
invent
and
use
my
own
algorithms
share
them
with
my
friends
and
sell
them
disclaimer
all
opinions
expressed
are
my
own
