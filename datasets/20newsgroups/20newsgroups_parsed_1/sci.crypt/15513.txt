just
call
up

the
electromagnetic

from

are
lcd
displays
vulnerable
to
tempest
i
can
see
highvoltage
type
display
devices
being
vulnerable
crts
plasma
displays
etc
but
jason
beat
me
to
this
question
what
about
em
radiation
from
lowvoltage
items
like
lcd
displays
perhaps
the
critical
element
is
the
driver
circuitry
the
cabling
what
about
a
portable
pcmacetc
where
all
the
noise
is
bunched
into
one
tiny
area
