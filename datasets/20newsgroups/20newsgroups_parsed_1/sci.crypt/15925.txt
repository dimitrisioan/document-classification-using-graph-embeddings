subject
information
on
mathematics
of
cryptography
followup
i
posted
an
informational
request
about
any
electronically
available
articles
on
cryptographic
algorithms
a
couple
of
days
ago
as
i
mentioned
i
was
interested
in
particular
in
des
and
publickey
but
also
wouldnt
mind
learning
about
others
as
i
said
i
can
read
an
intrograduate
level
text
book
having
had
some
mathematics
though
not
much
numbertheory
per
se
id
like
to
see
the
technical
details
of
the
mathematics
of
cryptography
as
oppossed
to
the
popularizations
of
things
like
scientific
am
which
just
say
then
you
find
a
really
big
prime
number
following
my
request
several
people
were
so
kind
as
to
suggest
readinglists
which
i
hope
to
get
around
to
two
other
people
were
so
very
kind
as
to
send
large
documents
which
i
presume
were
actual
articles
about
lines
each
but
ive
stupidly
deleted
them
accidentally
before
having
a
chance
even
to
skim
them
if
they
can
forgive
me
for
my
careless
use
of
filecommands
would
the
original
senders
be
so
kind
as
to
resend
or
anyone
else
who
has
good
cryptoarticles
at
a
fairly
technical
mathematical
level
also
ftpable
or
gopherable
docs
would
be
nice
to
know
about
yours
lulu
this
message
was
brought
to
you
by
postmodern
enterprises
the
opinions
expressed
here
must
be
those
of
my
employer
surely
you
dont
think
that
i
believe
them
