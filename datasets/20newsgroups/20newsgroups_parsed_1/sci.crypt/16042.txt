im
afraid
this
doesnt
work
either
we
can

i
heard
somewhere
cant
name
the
source
that
tempest
does
not
necessarily
pickup
just
crts
but
it
can
pick
up
emissions
from
almost
any
chip
if
that
is
true
the
kind
monitor
would
not
make
any
difference
becuase
everything
on
the
screen
can
be
pickedup
from
the
video
controller
can
anybody
verify
or
refute
this
yes
thats
true
tempest
is
nothing
magic
its
just
listening
to
any
available
electromagnetic
emissions
and
using
all
the
analysis
techniques
you
know
to
separate
out
the
interesting
stuff
the
nice
thing
about
old
crts
is
that
they
used
to
put
out
lots
of
signal
so
theyre
easy
to
detect
and
if
you
do
your
sync
carefully
you
can
watch
the
output
on
the
monitor
in
your
deceptivelymarked
chevy
stepvan
some
brands
of
electric
typewriters
were
even
worse
in
both
cases
its
especially
nice
because
it
gets
you
the
data
the
user
is
looking
at
rather
than
whatever
stuff
the
paging
algorithm
is
paging
out
to
disk
etc
with
newer
quieter
equipment
there
isnt
as
much
signal
and
its
harder
to
isolate
the
fun
parts
tempestrated
equipment
has
much
lower
signal
levels
but
everything
has
vibrations
