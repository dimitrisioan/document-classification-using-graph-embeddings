re
i
have
seen
the
lobby
and
it
is
us
in

writes
certainly
with
our
waycool
internet
powers
of
organization
we
can
act
in
the
same
way
if
such
action
is
appropriate
as
long
as
we
are
kept
informed
of
events
anyone
on
this
bboard
can
make
a
call
to
action
hopefully
were
a
strong
enough
community
to
act
on
those
calls
i
realize
this
is
a
little
optomistic
and
im
glad
eff
is
working
in
the
loop
on
these
issues
but
dont
underestimate
the
potential
of
the
net
for
political
action
adam
i
speak
for
myself
i
second
the
motion
all
in
favor
btw
a
few
days
ago
charles
fee
posted
the
names
addresses
and
phone
numbers
voice
and
fax
of
almost
all
the
rd
congresss
members
this
info
along
witha
great
number
of
cabinet
men
etc
i
captured
it
as
did
many
others
i
am
sure
we
should
single
out
a
few
of
the
people
on
the
list
and
bombard
them
with
lobbying
against
the
clipper
chip
