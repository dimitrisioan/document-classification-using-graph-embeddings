really
like
to
see
such
a
thing
developed
so
that
interactive
internet
talk
radio
could
be
done
ideally
though
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
device
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
enough
device
that
nobody
should
be
able
to
balk
at
its
widespread
use
obviously
to
make
it
easy
for
homebrewers
it
should
use
pretty
common
hardware
why
dont
we
move
down
even
further
toward
the
masses
by
setting
this
up
on
an
ibm
pc
cloneprobably
needs
to
be
a
or
a
with
a
sound
blaster
and
a
vbis
modem
those
components
are
very
widely
i
concur
for
a
pc
to
pc
version
but
for
a
interactive
thing
like
internet
talk
radio
it
makes
me
cringe
at
the
amount
of
hogging
such
a
thing
would
do
to
the
bandwidth
of
the
internet
i
mean
meg
files
getting
floated
around
for
internet
talk
radio
is
bad
enough
i
have
a
solution
use
the
phone
system
take
your
electronics
and
use
them
on
point
to
point
conversations
through
the
phone
and
thats
it
if
you
need
to
tell
someone
something
secret
and
very
important
wouldnt
it
make
more
sense
to
write
it
out
concisely
and
if
its
just
a
quick
yo
then
use
a
code
word
and
spend
your
twenty
cents
those
good
ol
analog
systems
like
shortwave
telephones
and
tvs
have
a
use
dont
gunk
up
a
nice
digital
packet
network
trying
to
emulate
them
