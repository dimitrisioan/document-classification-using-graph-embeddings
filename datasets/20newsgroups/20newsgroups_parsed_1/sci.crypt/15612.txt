it
seems
likely
to
me
that
that
a
large
subset
of
encrypted
communications
would
be
archived
to
tape
so
they
could
be
read
if
sometime
in
the
future
probable
cause
arises
and
a
warrant
is
obtained
i
can
even
imagine
this
being
found
legal
and
constitutional
since
nothing
is
actually
listened
to
until
a
valid
warrant
is
issued
and
the
keys
are
obtained
imagine
archiving
all
payphone
conversations
so
if
someone
turns
out
to
be
a
drug
dealer
you
can
listen
to
all
their
past
drug
deals
and
archive
calls
tofrom
suspected
mafia
members
potential
terrorists
radicals
etc
imagine
the
convenience
for
the
police
of
being
able
to
get
a
warrant
now
and
listening
to
all
the
calls
the
world
trade
center
bombers
made
in
the
past
year
imagine
if
this
were
available
during
the
elections
instead
of
clumsily
searching
through
the
clinton
passport
file
they
could
have
just
done
a
voicegrep
as
someone
stated
earlier
on
his
telephone
conversations
for
the
last
years
im
not
a
lawyer
and
i
dont
even
play
one
on
tv
but
intuitively
theres
something
wrong
with
having
ones
words
archived
for
possible
future
use
against
you
this
possibility
frightens
me
more
than
any
of
the
talk
about
the
clipper
chip
right
to
cryptography
etc
since
archiving
would
be
such
a
powerful
tool
and
so
easy
to
do
why
wouldnt
it
happen
im
afraid
it
just
might

its
a
miracle
that
curiosity

survives
