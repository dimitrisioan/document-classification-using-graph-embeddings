s
and
s
do
not
change
let
me
see
if
i
have
this
straight
if
a
person
knows
s
and
s
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
its
easy
to
reconstruct
uk
of
course
if
they
know
sk
the
family
key
they
can
easily
get
the
serial
number
of
any
unit
that
has
made
a
transmission
so
with
s
and
s
being
used
for
a
while
batch
of
the
unit
keys
the
number
of
used
ss
pairs
will
probably
be
fairly
low
of
course
you
have
to
believe
that
the
nsafbinameyourfavoritegovernment
agency
will
know
sk
so
all
it
needs
is
the
ss
pairs
and
presto
nasty
details
like
court
orders
for
wire
taps
are
no
longer
necessary
now
im
not
one
of
the
people
who
distrusts
the
government
at
every
turn
but
taking
someones
word
for
it
that
the
ss
pairs
are
not
kept
around
is
pushing
what
im
willing
to
believe
just
a
little
bit
too
far

the

that
