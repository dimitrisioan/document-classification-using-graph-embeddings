the
attorney
general
good
post
describing
what
is
in
store
for
us
deleted
its
also
interesting
to
note
that
two
months
ago
rush
limbaugh
said
that
clinton
would
have
the
plumbers
out
in
force
shortly
clinton
and
his
henchmen
firmly
believe
in
strong
ubiquitous
government
control
anytime
a
leader
believes
in
that
the
leader
will
use
every
means
possible
to
retain
that
control
and
take
more
we
have
to
take
our
government
back
otherwise
we
will
end
up
living
in
the
equivalent
of
a
hightech
third
world
dictatorship
we
have
to
take
responsibility
for
ourselves
our
personal
welfare
and
our
actions
i
totally
agree
but
how
do
you
propose
we
take
government
back
they
obviously
dont
listen
to
the
people
or
want
the
people
to
know
who
is
responsibile
for
what
a
person
telnetted
the
site
of
the
clipper
chip
release
to
see
what
the
entity
clipper
was
and
got
a
few
lists
but
when
another
person
tried
a
bit
later
the
commands
were
disabled
does
not
sound
like
an
administration
that
wants
to
have
any
accountability
or
information
they
dont
control
given
to
the
people
the
secret
development
and
implimentation
of
the
clipper
chip
decision
further
backs
that
up
you
can
bet
unaurhorized
encryption
methods
and
software
will
be
considered
terrorist
tools
and
also
subject
to
civil
forfeiture
along
with
the
systems
that
are
running
it
you
watch
see
if
i
am
wrong
the
government
is
not
going
to
be
very
cooperative
about
the
people
taking
it
back
and
they
have
all
the
resources
unlimited
access
to
the
media
for
propeganda
and
almost
all
the
guns
soon
to
be
all
the
guns
if
clintons
agenda
succeeds
those
that
do
not
play
ball
waco
might
be
a
good
example
of
what
to
expect
the
warrant
just
released
stated
the
reason
for
the
raid
was
the
bds
spent
a
very
large
sum
for
weapons
over
an
undetermined
amount
of
time
i
dont
recall
spending
a
lot
of
money
on
guns
etc
being
illegal
yet
that
is
clinton
might
go
down
in
history
as
the
worst
thing
to
ever
happen
to
the
us
of
a
now
to
be
known
as
the
