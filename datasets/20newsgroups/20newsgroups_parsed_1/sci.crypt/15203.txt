re
reinventing
crypto
policy
an
eff
statement
in
article
danny
weitzner
writes
the
bit
key
will
be
divided
between
two
escrow
agents
each
of
whom
hold
bits
of
each
key
presumably
the
key
split
is
so
that
no
one
group
controls
the
privacy
of
the
key
and
that
it
would
be
infeasible
to
illicitly
gain
access
from
both
agents
however
if
one
agent
wishes
to
break
the
crypto
without
the
cooperation
of
the
other
agent
a
bit
key
is
not
going
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
brute
force
attack
if
an
agency
for
example
the
nsa
were
to
hold
one
of
the
two
keyhalves
then
i
dont
imagine
they
really
need
the
other
half
of
the
key
to
start
listening
in
or
was
that
the
point
grin
this
is
not
to
imply
at
all
that
i
like
the
idea
of
the
rest
of
the
system
lee
brintle
and
so
i
leave
you
with
this
final
