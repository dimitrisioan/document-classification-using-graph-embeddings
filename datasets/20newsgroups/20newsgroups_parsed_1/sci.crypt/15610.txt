if
there
are
many
as
er
people
in
the
usa
who
reason
like
the
above
then
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
the
current
plot
has
been
allowed
to
happen
the
willingness
of
the
majority
of
the
people
to
give
up
their
freedom
in
exchange
for
a
sense
of
safety
is
hardly
limited
to
the
usa
and
is
an
endemic
problem
in
any
human
society
of
any
appreciable
size
the
structure
of
the
us
government
does
try
to
combat
this
tendency
to
some
extent
but
fighting
entropy
is
always
a
losing
battle
most
people
would
rather
have
comfort
than
freedom
the
paradox
is
that
you
cant
really
have
the
former
in
the
long
term
unless
you
have
the
latter
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
probably
come
across
to
some
people
as
a
weird
cross
between
a
libertarian
and
an
establishment
tool
is
that
i
end
up
taking
an
utterly
pragmatic
view
of
government
i
dont
get
up
in
arms
when
the
government
fails
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
people
because
in
my
lifetime
it
never
hastherefore
i
have
no
expectation
that
it
will
as
a
result
i
protect
my
own
interests
rather
than
expecting
the
government
to
be
fair
i
will
use
strong
cryptography
when
i
think
it
is
needed
whether
or
not
it
is
legal
at
the
time
same
thing
with
anything
else
the
government
would
rather
not
see
in
private
handsthats
their
problem
whats
important
to
me
is
using
the
right
tool
for
the
job
if
its
legal
so
much
the
better
if
it
is
not
but
does
not
violate
my
very
strong
sense
of
personal
ethics
i
will
use
it
anyway
as
long
i
think
it
is
worth
it
expecting
the
government
to
actually
protect
the
interests
of
its
citizens
except
by
accident
is
utter
folly
even
jefferson
one
of
the
major
architects
of
the
american
system
of
government
figured
that
in
a
couple
hundred
years
it
would
become
so
corrupt
and
selfserving
that
it
would
be
time
dismantle
it
and
try
again
by
revolution
if
necessary
i
agree
and
while
i
dont
go
around
trying
to
spark
one
ill
certainly
participate
if
it
happens
when
im
around
there
is
a
reason
i
am
such
a
strong
supporter
of
individual
rights
while
being
so
cynical
about
politics
ive
already
written
off
politics
and
yes
this
may
get
me
in
trouble
some
day
if
so
so
be
it
i
drive
faster
than
mph
too
