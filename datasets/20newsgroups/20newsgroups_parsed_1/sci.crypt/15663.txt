lets
assume
a

engine
like
that
hypothesized
for
des
microsecond
per
trial
million
chips
thats
trials
per
second
or
about
years
for
trials
well
maybe
they
can
get
chips
running
at
one
trial
per
nanosecond
and
build
a
machine
with
million
chips
sure
only
years
for
each
solution
normally
id
be
the
last
to
argue
with
steve
but
shouldnt
that
read
years
for
all
solutions
i
mean
if
we
can
imagine
the
machine
that
does
trialnanosecond
we
can
imagine
the
storage
medium
that
could
index
and
archive
it
at
the
company
i
worked
for
previously
i
received
a
file
that
was
des
encryped
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
weeks
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
only
took
two
days
to
crack
the
file
no
i
dont
have
any
