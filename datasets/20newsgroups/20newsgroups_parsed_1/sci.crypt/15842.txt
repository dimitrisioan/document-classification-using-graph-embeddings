send
something
to
rush
linbaugh
about
clinton
taking
away
our
right
to
privacy
and
how
if
the
govt
standard
takes
off
only
people
with
lots
of
money
drug
dealers
will
be
able
to
justify
des
stuff
he
will
slam
clinton
for
this
on
the
air
rob
i
seem
to
recall
rush
saying
that
he
has
a
compuserve
account
if
anyone
wants
to
email
him
all
we
need
is
his
account
number
ie
and
then
we
could
email
him
via
gateway
by
using
a
dot
instead
of
a
comma
like
so
this
is
not
his
address
so
does
anyone
know
his
email
address
he
says
he
uses
it
all
the
time
i
wonder
if
he
reads
altfanrushlimbaugh
his
ego
is
big
enough
