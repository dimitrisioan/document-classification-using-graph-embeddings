some
questions
regarding
big
brother
clipper
in
previous
postings
by

bellovin
etal
it
was
reported
the
big
brother
clipper
chip
will
encrypt
plaintext
in
bit
blocks
as
is
done
with
des
the
users
key
k
which
can
be
derived
from
rsa
diffyhellman
etc
is
used
to
encrypt
plaintext
m
and
is
then
used
to
form
a
three
part
message
this
three
part
message
consists
of
em
k
k
encrypted
with
some
other
key
and
the
chip
serial
number
this
three
part
message
is
then
encrypted
by
still
another
key
my
question
is
what
is
a
message
for
example
say
we
are
dealing
with
an
encrypted
digitized
voice
application
the
speech
waveform
is
sampled
and
digitized
and
then
some
number
of
samples
are
grouped
into
a
bit
block
this
block
is
then
encrypted
and
transmitted
over
a
nonsecure
communications
link
where
is
the
three
part
message
is
something
appended
to
each
bit
block
is
a
header
sent
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
if
the
header
is
sent
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
how
do
they
insure
the
equipment
manufacturer
using
the
chip
does
just
that
can
just
anyone
manufacture
products
using
the
chip
is
a
facility
clearance
required
to
manufacture
any
ideas
