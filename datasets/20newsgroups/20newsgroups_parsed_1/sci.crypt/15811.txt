would

summary
compared
to
an
average
monthly
phone
bill
of
sixty
dollars
wiretaps
are
only
worth
two
cents
a
month
to
police
so
the
proposed
wiretap
chip
must
raise
phone
costs
by
less
than
one
part
in
three
thousand
to
be
costeffective
robins
calculation
is
interesting
and
important
even
if
its
off
by
an
order
of
magnitude
for
example
even
if
hardware
costs
for
the
clipper
chip
phones
were
zero
the
protocol
overhead
in
transmitting
the
escrow
field
would
be
much
higher
than
the
part
in
thousandit
depends
on
the
exact
details
of
the
phone
call
length
protocol
etc
shorter
calls
get
a
proportionately
greater
hit
however
i
suspect
most
americans
will
not
find
this
line
of
reasoning
as
persuasive
