how

what
about

publickey
cryptosystems
what
is
publickey
cryptography
in
a
classic
cryptosystem
we
have
encryption
functions
ek
and
decryption
functions
dk
such
that
dkekp
p
for
any
plaintext
p
in
a
publickey
cryptosystem
ek
can
be
easily
computed
from
some
public
key
x
which
in
turn
is
computed
from
k
x
is
published
so
that
anyone
can
encrypt
messages
if
dk
can
not
be
easily
computed
from
x
then
only
the
person
who
generated
k
can
decrypt
messages
thats
the
essence
of
publickey
cryptography
published
by
diffie
and
hellman
in
in
a
classic
cryptosystem
if
you
want
your
friends
to
be
able
to
send
secret
messages
to
you
you
have
to
make
sure
nobody
other
than
them
sees
the
key
k
in
a
publickey
cryptosystem
you
just
publish
x
and
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
spies
this
is
only
the
beginning
of
publickey
cryptography
there
is
an
extensive
literature
on
security
models
for
publickey
cryptography
applications
of
publickey
cryptography
other
applications
of
the
mathematical
technology
behind
publickey
cryptography
and
so
on
whats
rsa
rsa
is
a
publickey
cryptosystem
defined
by
rivest
shamir
and
adleman
for
full
details
there
is
a
faq
available
by
ftp
at
rsacom
heres
a
small
example
plaintexts
are
positive
integers
up
to
keys
are
quadruples
pqed
with
p
a
bit
prime
number
q
a
bit
prime
number
and
d
and
e
large
numbers
with
de
divisible
by
pq
we
define
ekp
pe
mod
pq
dkc
cd
mod
pq
now
ek
is
easily
computed
from
the
pair
pqebut
as
far
as
anyone
knows
there
is
no
easy
way
to
compute
dk
from
the
pair
pqe
so
whoever
generates
k
can
publish
pqe
anyone
can
send
a
secret
message
to
him
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
read
the
messages
is
rsa
secure
nobody
knows
an
obvious
attack
on
rsa
is
to
factor
pq
into
p
and
q
see
below
for
comments
on
how
fast
stateoftheart
factorization
algorithms
run
unfortunately
nobody
has
the
slightest
idea
how
to
prove
that
factorizationor
any
realistic
problem
at
all
for
that
matteris
inherently
slow
it
is
easy
to
formalize
what
we
mean
by
rsa
isisnt
strong
but
as
hendrik
w
lenstra
jr
says
exact
definitions
appear
to
be
necessary
only
when
one
wishes
to
prove
that
algorithms
with
certain
properties
do
not
exist
and
theoretical
computer
science
is
notoriously
lacking
in
such
negative
results
how
fast
can
people
factor
numbers
it
depends
on
the
size
of
the
numbers
in
october
arjen
lenstra
and
dan
bernstein
factored
into
primes
using
about
three
weeks
of
maspar
time
the
maspar
is
a
processor
simd
machine
each
processor
can
add
about
integers
per
second
the
algorithm
there
is
called
the
number
field
sieve
it
is
quite
a
bit
faster
for
special
numbers
like
than
for
general
numbers
n
but
it
takes
time
only
about
expolog
n
log
log
n
in
any
case
an
older
and
more
popular
method
for
smaller
numbers
is
the
multiple
polynomial
quadratic
sieve
which
takes
time
expolog
n
log
log
nfaster
than
the
number
field
sieve
for
small
n
but
slower
for
large
n
the
breakeven
point
is
somewhere
between
and
digits
depending
on
the
implementations
factorization
is
a
fastmoving
fieldthe
state
of
the
art
just
a
few
years
ago
was
nowhere
near
as
good
as
it
is
now
if
no
new
methods
are
developed
then
bit
rsa
keys
will
always
be
safe
from
factorization
but
one
cant
predict
the
future
before
the
number
field
sieve
was
found
many
people
conjectured
that
the
quadratic
sieve
was
asymptotically
as
fast
as
any
factoring
method
could
be
what
about
other
publickey
cryptosystems
weve
talked
about
rsa
because
its
well
known
and
easy
to
describe
but
there
are
lots
of
other
publickey
systems
around
many
of
which
are
faster
than
rsa
or
depend
on
problems
more
widely
believed
to
be
difficult
this
has
been
just
a
brief
introduction
if
you
really
want
to
learn
about
the
many
facets
of
publickey
cryptography
consult
the
books
and
journal
articles
listed
