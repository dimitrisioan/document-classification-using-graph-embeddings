dorothy
denning
youre
reading
far
too
much
into
this
aside
from
the
obvious
fact
that
you
shouldnt
hold
anybody
to
what
they
wrote
in
a
year
old
book
in
a
rapidly
changing
field
like
this
quite
simply
she
says
that
the
security
should
not
depend
on
the
secrecy
of
the
algorithm
a
secret
algorithm
can
still
be
secure
after
all
we
just
dont
know
it
only
our
level
of
trust
is
affected
not
the
security
of
the
system
the
algorithm
could
be
rsa
for
all
we
know
which
we
believe
to
be
secure
they
have
a
much
better
reason
to
classify
the
algorithm
than
to
protect
its
security
they
want
to
protect
its
market
share
if
they
publish
the
algorithm
then
shortly
manufacturers
would
make
chips
that
implement
the
algorithm
and
standard
but
do
not
use
a
key
stored
in
escrow
and
of
course
everybody
would
buy
them
the
whole
push
of
this
chip
is
that
by
establishing
a
standard
that
you
can
only
use
if
you
follow
their
rules
they
get
us
to
follow
their
rules
without
enacting
new
laws
that
we
would
fight
tooth
and
nail
quite
simply
with
clipper
established
it
would
be
much
harder
for
another
encryption
maker
to
define
a
new
standard
to
make
phones
that
cant
talk
to
the
leading
phone
companies
the
result
is
tappable
cryptography
without
laws
forbidding
other
kinds
for
of
the
populace
to
get
untappable
crypto
you
would
have
to
build
a
special
phone
that
runs
on
top
of
this
system
and
everybody
you
talk
to
would
have
to
have
an
indentical
one
thats
the
chicken
and
egg
of
crypto
the
government
is
using
its
very
special
ability
to
solve
chicken
and
egg
problems
of
new
technologies
to
control
this
one
in
a
way
they
like
its
almost
admirably
clever
when
the
eff
started
i
posed
the
question
here
what
are
the
police
going
to
do
when
they
wake
up
and
discover
they
cant
wiretap
and
nobody
here
had
an
answer
or
even
thought
it
was
much
of
a
question
then
came
the
backdoor
and
digital
telephony
bills
which
we
fought
now
we
have
their
real
answer
the
cleverest
of
all
