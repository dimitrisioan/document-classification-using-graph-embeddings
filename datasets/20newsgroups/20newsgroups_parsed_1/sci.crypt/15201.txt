i
sent
a
response
to
the
white
house
at
white
house
and
received
a
nice
automatic
reply
from
micmail
noting
in
passing
that
if
i
had
included
a
snail
address
i
would
get
a
reply
in
due
course
for
those
who
care
my
reply
was
yes
lets
protect
the
voice
network
privatelydeveloped
crypto
has
always
been
available
and
always
will
be
so
lets
think
about
how
to
do
law
enforcement
given
that
fact
not
about
how
to
hope
to
legislate
against
it
my
needs
for
crypto
as
a
system
designer
are
not
met
by
the
clipper
chip
i
want
freely
to
export
uses
of
algorithms
like
des
rsa
which
are
already
freely
available
in
the
