im
not
a
lawyer
so
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
doing
that
could
be
considered
obstruction
of
justice
which
could
land
you
in
prison
for
quite
a
while
the
thing
thats
great
about
the
secret
key
is
it
is
idea
encrypted
so
even
if
the
fbi
do
get
the
key
theyre
sol
unless
they
know
the
magic
word
if
they
try
to
force
you
to
give
them
your
pass
phrase
just
say
oops
i
forgot
since
the
burden
of
proof
is
still
on
the
prosecution
in
this
country
if
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
how
can
they
prove
that
you
didnt
forget
your
pass
phrase
well
im
no
lawyer
but
ill
supply
some
ancedotal
evidence
which
may
change
your
mind
note
i
do
not
agree
at
all
with
what
went
on
in
this
case
and
neither
will
most
of
you
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
it
did
happen
right
here
in
america
even
about
three
or
four
years
ago
there
was
a
rather
nasty
custody
case
in
or
around
washington
dc
the
upshot
was
an
exhusband
was
suing
for
visitation
rights
which
were
granted
the
woman
believed
that
the
man
had
been
sexually
molesting
her
children
much
like
allenfarrow
but
not
as
famous
anyhows
she
spirits
away
the
kids
and
refuses
to
tell
the
court
where
they
are
and
denies
him
visitation
rights
she
keeps
her
mouth
shut
and
what
happens
she
sits
in
jail
for
almost
a
year
on
contempt
of
court
until
the
legislature
passes
a
special
law
limiting
the
time
a
person
can
be
held
if
they
hadnt
passed
the
law
shed
most
likely
still
be
there
the
kids
were
in
new
zealand
i
belive
now
story
finished
commetary
starting
imho
the
only
reason
the
legislature
moved
was
because
there
was
an
outpouring
of
public
sympathy
for
this
woman
most
people
believed
she
was
right
and
were
outraged
not
likely
to
happen
for
joe
random
drug
dealer
child
molester
or
perfectly
innocent
privacy
lover
who
might
have
something
to
hide
innocent
until
proven
guilty
doesnt
mean
you
get
to
walk
out
of
court
humming
a
happy
tune
because
the
fbi
cant
read
your
disk
just
ask
those
held
for
contempt
those
who
cant
make
bail
etc
etc
again
i
disagree
totally
with
the
concept
of
holding
someone
based
on
suspicion
but
people
who
keep
thinking
that
it
wont
happen
are
bound
to
get
a
rude
shock
when
it
does
also
not
a
lawyer
etc
but
if
i
remember
correctly
the
contempt
of
court
business
is
used
in
order
to
compel
cooperation
with
what
is
perhaps
questionably
different
issue
the
legitimate
business
of
that
court
quite
literally
the
party
is
found
guilty
of
holding
the
court
in
contempt
now
the
original
scheme
as
suggested
here
would
be
to
have
the
key
disappear
if
certain
threatening
conditions
are
met
once
the
key
is
gone
there
is
no
question
of
contempt
of
court
as
there
is
nothing
to
compell
the
key
is
no
longer
there
to
be
produced
obstruction
of
justice
would
be
a
different
issue
but
if
the
suspect
in
question
would
have
some
legitmate
reason
to
protect
his
data
from
prying
eyes
however
extenuated
i
think
that
this
charge
would
be
a
hard
nut
to
make
perhaps
it
is
time
for
a
lawyer
to
step
in
and
clear
this
all
up
