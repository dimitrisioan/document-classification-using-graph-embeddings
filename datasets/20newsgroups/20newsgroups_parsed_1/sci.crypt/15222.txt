perhaps
we
need
the

equivalent

an

back
in
prohibition
days
alcohol
that
is
i
understand
a
device
called
the
cheesebox
was
a
popular
means
to
thwart
the
tracing
of
telephone
calls
it
connected
two
phone
lines
in
the
back
room
of
an
otherwise
uninvolved
business
it
was
the
conceptual
predecesso
of
todays
anonymous
email
remailer
the
old
cheesebox
was
the
precarterphone
version
of
the
call
diverter
after
the
carterphone
decision
there
were
several
vendors
that
sold
call
diverters
ive
got
a
couple
in
my
basement
that
were
used
to
redirect
my
office
phone
to
my
home
number
when
i
didnt
feel
like
going
into
the
office
itd
be
quite
easy
to
generate
an
anonymous
redialer
version
of
the
call
diverter
about
months
ago
i
heard
a
report
on
npr
about
a
number
stopper
or
some
such
for
placing
untraceable
calls
you
call
them
and
on
bong
tone
dial
the
number
you
want
to
call
they
told
the
npr
interviewer
that
nothing
short
of
a
court
order
which
theyd
fight
would
make
them
release
their
records

pretend
to
be
