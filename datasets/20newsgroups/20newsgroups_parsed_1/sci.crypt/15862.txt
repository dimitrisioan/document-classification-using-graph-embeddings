lets
build
software
cryptophones
for
over
the
internet
well
after
a
lot
of
trawling
through
archives
i
found
the
post
i
reproduce
in
full
below
is
it
time
to
get
together
to
develop
a
tcpip
standard
for
crypto
voice
that
we
could
then
layer
on
pointtopoint
slip
as
the
free
standard
for
crypto
voice
like
pgp
is

the

revolve
around
code
excited

celp
algorithms
which
capture
ms

of

and
attempt
to
match
the

with
a

of
signals
from

choosing
the
