clipper
and
ranting
libertarians
i
would
think
that
you
could
reduce
the
defense
of
using
nonclipper
based
encryption
technologies
to
defending
freedom
of
expression
ie
free
speech
that
you
have
to
right
to
express
whatever
you
want
in
whatever
form
your
little
heart
desires
so
long
as
you
do
not
impinge
on
the
rights
of
others
encrypted
textsoundvideo
is
just
another
form
of
expression
of
that
particular
textsoundvideo
just
like
digitized
sound
is
another
means
of
expression
of
sound
streams
of
instead
of
continuous
waveforms
also
it
shouldnt
be
up
to
the
government
at
all
encryption
standards
can
be
decided
upon
by
independent
standards
orgainizations
apologies
for
the
acronym
one
can
note
how
well
this
has
worked
with
iso
and
the
metric
system
sae
etc
independent
entities
or
consortia
of
peopleindustries
in
that
particular
area
are
far
more
qualified
to
set
standards
than
any
one
government
agency
consider
for
example
what
the
ascii
character
set
would
have
looked
like
if
it
was
decided
by
the
government
i
hope
this
helps
folks
to
formulate
their
defenses
im
still
working
on
mine
and
hope
to
be
faxing
my
congressmen
soon
