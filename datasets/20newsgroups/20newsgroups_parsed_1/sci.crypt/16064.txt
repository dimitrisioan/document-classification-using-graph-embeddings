writes
as
anyone
who
attended
hohocon
will
attest
you
can
pick
information
off
the
video

its
surprisingly
easy
too
the
guy
did
it
with
a
portable
tv
with
very
minor
mods
it
only
worked
from
feet
but
then
it
was
just
a
demonstration
a
convention
for
santa
claus
impersonators
please
elaborate
enquiring
minds
those

the
second
and
third
jars
from
the

want
to
