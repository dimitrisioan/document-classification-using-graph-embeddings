the

why
is
the
tripleencrytion
used
is
it
just
to
gain
an
effective
increase
in
keyspace
to
defeat
a
potential
keysearch
if
so
why
use
bit
keys
not
knowing
anything
about
the
skipjack
algorithm
its
not
really
possible
to
guess
whether
this
makes
it
harder
or
easier
to
guess
ss
why
are
n
n
and
n
formed
as
they
are
it
would
be
facinating
to
see
the
skipjack
algorithm
to
look
for
ways
of
attacking
it
that
require
three
ciphertext
blocks
formed
in
that
odd
way
where
do
the
bit
constant
values
that
are
concatenated
with
the
serial
number
to
form
nnn
come
from
are
they
changed
from
chip
to
chip
or
session
to
session
even
if
theyre
published
in
the
ny
times
if
skipjack
is
resistant
to
knownplaintext
attacks
when
using
triple
encryption
then
theres
no
break
in
security
but
why
allow
that
kind
of
weird
format
if
those
three
bit
values
are
trulyrandom
bits
then
maybe
its
used
to
ensure
that
a
knownplaintext
attack
on
skipjack
if
it
exists
cant
be
easily
used
to
derive
s
and
s
for
a
whole
production
