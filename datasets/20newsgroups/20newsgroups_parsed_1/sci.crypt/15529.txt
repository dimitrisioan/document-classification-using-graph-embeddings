the
plaintext
is
digitized
voice
and
exists
for
a
very
short
time
probably
in
a
couple
inches
of
copper
tops
its
flatly
not
available
your
bug
in
my
office
can
hear
my
voice
and
even
digitize
it
but
its
going
to
get
a
different
bitstream
i
am
an
idiot
the
plaintext
thats
relevant
is
the
session
key
if
you
know
that
you
probably
dont
need
a
roomful
of
chips
do
you
if
you
were
going
to
brute
force
something
interesting
thatd
be
the
message
stream
which
is
sort
of
approximately
known
by
say
a
bug
in
my
office
then
your
roomful
of
chips
could
get
the
session
key
which
i
change
every
morning
really
its
just
a
whole
lot
easier
for
the
illicit
wiretappers
to
stick
a
bug
in
your
phone
