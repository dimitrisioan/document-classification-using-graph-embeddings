the
only
theory
that
makes
any
sense
is
that
s
and
s
are
either
the
same
for
all
chips
or
vary
among
very
few
possibilities
so
that
anyone
trying
to
break
the
encryption
by
brute
force
need
only
plow
through
the
possible
serial
numbers
about
one
billion
multiplied
by
the
number
of
different
s
s
combinations
iff
the
phones
transmit
their
serial
nos
as
part
of
the
message
then
what
is
to
say
that
each
phone
can
take
that
serial
number
and
use
it
to
generate
the
required
key
