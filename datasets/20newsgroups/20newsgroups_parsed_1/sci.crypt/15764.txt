i
wouldnt
think
so
asking
people
to
trust
a
secret
algorithm
seems
unsound
to
me
maybe
so
but
its
quite
common
there
are
millions
of
macintosh
users
who
have
no
idea
whats
in
apples
patented
roms
many
have
modems
connected
how
do
you
know
all
your
business
secrets
arent
being
stolen
answer
because
you
trust
apple
because
if
any
such
attempt
however
sophicsticated
came
out
it
would
destroy
apples
credibility
forever
in
the
clipper
case
a
representative
body
of
experts
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
audit
it
and
well
have
assurances
maybe
even
from
the
president
that
other
than
the
escrowed
keys
there
are
no
back
doors
while
some
may
not
have
confidence
in
that
i
am
not
among
them
its
a
lot
more
assurance
than
we
get
for
many
things
we
routinely
trust
in
everyday
life
