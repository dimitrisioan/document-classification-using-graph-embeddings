heres
a
simple
way
to
convert
the
clipper
proposal
to
an
unexceptionable
one
make
it
voluntary
as
usually
you
are
not
reading
the
proposal
does
say
that
it
is
a
voluntary
program
this
doesnt
make
it
more
desirable
though
that
isyou
get
high
quality
secure
nsa
classified
technology
if
you
agree
to
escrow
your
key
otherwise
you
are
on
your
own
secure
how
do
you
know
because
nsa
is
trying
to
make
you
believe
it
trust
us
yeah
right
otherwise
you
are
on
your
own
how
do
you
know
that
tomorrow
they
will
not
outlaw
encrypring
devices
that
dont
use
their
technology
because
they
are
promising
you
gee
they
are
not
doing
even
that
read
the
proposal
again
