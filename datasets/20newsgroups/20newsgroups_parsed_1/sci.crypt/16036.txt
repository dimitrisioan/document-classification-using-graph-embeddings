clipper
considered
harmful
restated

in

writes
it
is
still
easy
to
conceal
superencryption
at
least
until
the
inquisitors
get
ahold
of
the
k
key
which
can
take
a
while
presumably
not
in
nearrealtime
worstcase
in
which
the
escrow
agencies
provide
the
u
key
to
the
local
cops
still
only
gets
one
side
of
the
conversation
per
warrant
unless
the
same
key
is
used
for
both
directions
which
i
suppose
the
capstone
version
of
the
chip
will
probably
insist
on
i
was
under
the
impression
from
reading
dennings
description
of
the
clippers
operation
that
the
same
session
key
is
used
in
both
directions
for
encrypting
the
message
text
but
that
each
chip
uses
its
own
key
for
encrypting
the
session
key
into
the
lawenforcement
field
so
you
only
need
to
know
the
u
key
for
one
of
the
phones
involved
to
decrypt
the
messages
in
both
directions
