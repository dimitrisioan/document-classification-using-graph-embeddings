just

some
other
very
electricallynoisy
device
as
ive
noted
you
can
likely
get
around
that
with
a
directional
sensor
phased
array
systems
could
completely
defeat
this
scheme
true
but
the
basic
idea
behind
any
communications
security
system
is
not
to
absolutely
deny
access
but
to
make
access
more
expensive
in
time
money
manpower
than
it
is
worth
another
idea
use
a
laptop
computer
as
mentioned
earlier
the
lcd
screen
is
a
lot
less
noisy
than
a
standard
crt
but
since
many
laptops
have
power
supplies
that
run
at
volts
instead
of
they
would
be
considerably
quieter
