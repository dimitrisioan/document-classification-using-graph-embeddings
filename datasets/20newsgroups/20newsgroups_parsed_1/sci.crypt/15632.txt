writes
as
one
of
the
happily
sleeping
people
i
would
just
like
to
ask
this
arent
people
just
slightly
overreacting
to
this
or
are
we
all
of
a
sudden
going
to
draw
parallels
to
nazi
germany
and
communist
russia
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
yes
this
is
a
serious
problem
but
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
guess
what
were
doing
something
now
you
cant
do
in
a
communist
country
or
nazi
germany
were
complaining
about
it
or
rather
youre
complaining
about
it
and
nobody
is
shooting
at
us
or
rather
if
theyre
shooting
at
me
they
have
real
bad
aim
guess
what
people
you
live
in
one
of
the
few
countries
in
the
world
where
a
person
can
complain
without
getting
shot
at
people
are
always
complaining
that
somebody
did
this
wrong
or
somebody
did
that
wrong
or
whatever
sit
down
and
figure
out
two
things
what
have
they
done
right
how
much
worse
can
it
get
and
youll
find
that
you
and
i
are
pretty
damn
lucky
so
lets
talk
about
it
get
some
action
going
decide
whats
going
on
but
lets
not
overreact
us
having
the
liberties
to
talk
about
this
doesnt
make
the
problem
go
away
it
doesnt
make
it
right
rather
the
opposite
if
we
do
not
do
anything
about
it
you
can
bet
its
going
to
get
worse
btw
these
are
my
opinions
and
not
that
of
any
other
entity
my
god
its
full
of
stars
dave
i
dont
know
about
you
but
weve
got
