its
ok
as
long
as
you
trust
the
enduser
to
stay
out
of
your
application
program
or
as
long
as
it
runs
in
a
system
where
the
user
cant
get
to
it
otherwise
you
cant
stop
him
from
finding
the
load
a
module
code
in
your
program
and
simply
bypassing
the
check
for
a
valid
module
the
devious
user
can
either
modify
the
object
code
before
running
the
program
or
he
can
run
the
program
under
a
debugger
and
change
the
instructions
in
memory
there
is
a
way
to
foil
debuggers
by
clearing
the
single
step
interrupt
on
which
a
debugger
depends
every
few
instructions
in
the
sensitive
areas
of
the
code
this
assumes
the
person
is
using
the
hardware
debug
instruction
of
an
x
type
processor
it
can
be
negated
by
noping
the
clear
debug
instruction
or
by
running
the
code
on
a
machine
simulator
like
one
i
wrote
as
a
senior
project
in
college
it
can
bypass
and
trace
practically
anything
one
could
write
in
software
kind
of
like
being
on
a
star
trek

please
reply
to
for
now
all
this
might
be
an
elaborate
simulation
running
in
a
