i
came
i
lurked
i
read
the
faq
now
having
purchased
the
recommended
books
and
having
taken
to
heart
the
advice
that
one
knows
nothing
about
crypto
without
having
done
a
stint
as
a
cryptanalyst
i
would
like
to
correspond
with
people
interested
in
cryptology
i
am
working
on
implementing
the
cryptanalysts
workbench
example
in
boochs
ood
with
applications
i
hope
to
start
sending
ciphers
back
and
forth
so
each
of
us
can
practice
cracking
them
i
would
like
to
start
with
simple
ceasers
ciphers
and
progress
roughly
according
to
david
kahns
book
of
course
i
would
be
interested
in
general
discussions
and
math
also
i
hope
to
have
some
foriegn
correspondants
so
that
we
can
test
the
response
time
of
the
men
in
the
suits
ive
been
hearing
so
much
about
unfortunately
as
a
product
of
the
american
education
system
i
only
know
english
looking
forward
to
any
and
all
responses
