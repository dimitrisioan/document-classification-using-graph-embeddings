wiretap
chips
the
security
of
the
system
does
depend
only
on
the
secrecy
of
the
keys
the
ability
to
tap
is
an
inherent
insecurity
which
depends
fundamentally
on
the
secrecy
of
the
algorithm
to
spell
it
out
because
so
many
people
seem
to
miss
the
point
if
the
algorithm
were
published
anyone
could
create
a
chip
which
would
work
correctly
with
the
skipjack
chips
but
which
would
not
have
its
key
registered
i
believe
there
is
no
technical
means
of
ensuring
key
escrow
without
the
government
maintaining
a
secret
of
some
kind
for
example
the
secret
could
be
the
private
keys
of
the
escrow
agencies
their
digital
signatures
would
be
required
before
a
key
could
be
used
in
this
case
the
nsanistwhoever
has
decided
that
protecting
the
entire
algorithm
is
