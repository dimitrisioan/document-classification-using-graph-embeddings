they
get
your
keys
david

writes
the
proposal
could
be
modified
so
that
if
they
get
a
court
order
to
tap
you
and
dont
charge
you
with
a
crime
within
say
days
they
have
to
buy
you
a
new
phone
if
they
do
charge
you
and
you
are
found
innocent
they
have
to
buy
you
a
new
phone
yeah
right
and
if
the
atf
trashes
your
place
on
a
bad
tip
they
have
to
pay
to
repair
it
sure
and
if
your
computer
equipment
is
confisticated
in
a
raid
they
have
to
charge
you
with
a
crime
within
say
days
youre
stretching
the
naivete
bit
on
this
one
love
two
minds
without
a
single
thought
