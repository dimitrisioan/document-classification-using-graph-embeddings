summary
elided
the
system
as
described
here
cant
possibly
work
what
happens
when
someone
plugs
the
above
ciphertext
into
a
receiving
chip
to
get
m
the
receiving
chip
needs
kp
to
get
kp
the
receiving
chip
needs
uc
the
only
information
it
can
work
with
is
c
if
uc
can
be
computed
from
c
then
the
system
is
cryptographically
useless
and
the
key
escrow
is
bullshit
otherwise
how
is
a
message
decrypted
the
description
of
the
chips
operation
evidently
leaves
out
some
of
the
key
management
aspects
either
the
kp
is
the
secret
key
corresponding
to
a
public
key
which
is
broadcast
at
message
initiation
or
it
is
the
result
of
a
diffiehellman
key
exchange
or
something
similar
either
way
there
must
be
some
protocols
beyond
those
described
here
it
isnt
clear
whether
they
are
implemented
in
the
clipper
wiretap
chip
or
must
be
provided
by
other
system
components
