short
summary
of
what
bellovin
says
hellman
says
the
nsa
says
there
is
a
global
key
g
plus
one
key
uc
for
each
chip
c
the
user
can
choose
a
new
session
key
kp
for
each
phone
call
p
he
makes
chip
c
knows
three
keys
g
its
own
uc
and
the
users
kp
the
government
as
a
whole
knows
g
and
every
uc
apparently
a
message
m
is
encrypted
as
egeuckpc
ekpm
thats
it
the
system
as
described
here
cant
possibly
work
what
happens
when
someone
plugs
the
above
ciphertext
into
a
receiving
chip
to
get
m
the
receiving
chip
needs
kp
to
get
kp
the
receiving
chip
needs
uc
the
only
information
it
can
work
with
is
c
if
uc
can
be
computed
from
c
then
the
system
is
cryptographically
useless
and
the
key
escrow
is
bullshit
otherwise
how
is
a
message
decrypted
via
kp
of
course
nothing
was
said
about
where
kp
comes
from
its
the
session
key
though
and
its
chosen
however
you
usually
choose
session
keys
exponential
key
exchange
shared
secret
rsa
etc
but
however
you
choose
it
the
chip
will
apparently
emit
the
escrow
header
when
you
do
