how
to
make
the
clipper
chip
and
wiretapping
less
bad
ive
got
an
idea
that
would
remove
most
of
the
political
complaints
i
have
about
the
clipper
chip
pass
a
law
stating
that
if
within
a
year
of
performaing
a
wiretap
on
someone
a
police
agency
hasnt
managed
to
convict
the
suspect
of
the
crime
the
warrantwiretap
was
for
then
that
agency
owes
the
suspect
million
to
repay
himher
for
lost
privacy
of
course
there
are
still
problems
with
the
technical
aspects
of
clipper
and
with
the
onesizefitsall
mentality
that
would
be
behind
an
attempt
to
enforce
it
as
a
standard
but
this
would
be
a
way
for
those
in
favor
of
allowing
continued
wiretaps
to
assure
us
that
it
will
only
be
used
in
cases
where
the
crime
is
important
and
the
police
are
all
but
certain
that
there
really
will
be
a
conviction
