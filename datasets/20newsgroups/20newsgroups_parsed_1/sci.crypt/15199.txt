the

was
released
by
the
white
house
today
in
conjunction
with
the
announcement
of
the
clipper
chip
encryption
technology
fact
sheet
public
encryption
management
the
president
has
approved
a
directive
on
public
encryption
management
the
directive
provides
for
the
following
advanced
telecommunications
and
commercially
available
encryption
are
part
of
a
wave
of
new
computer
and
communications
technology
encryption
products
scramble
information
to
protect
the
privacy
of
communications
and
data
by
preventing
unauthorized
access
advanced
telecommunications
systems
use
digital
technology
to
rapidly
and
precisely
handle
a
high
volume
of
communications
these
advanced
telecommunications
systems
are
integral
to
the
infrastructure
needed
to
ensure
economic
competitiveness
in
the
information
age
despite
its
benefits
new
communications
technology
can
also
frustrate
lawful
government
electronic
surveillance
sophisticated
encryption
can
have
this
effect
in
the
united
states
when
exported
abroad
it
can
be
used
to
thwart
foreign
intelligence
activities
critical
to
our
national
interests
in
the
past
it
has
been
possible
to
preserve
a
government
capability
to
conduct
electronic
surveillance
in
furtherance
of
legitimate
law
enforcement
and
national
security
interests
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
the
privacy
and
civil
liberties
of
all
citizens
as
encryption
technology
improves
doing
so
will
require
new
innovative
approaches
in
the
area
of
communications
encryption
the
u
s
government
has
developed
a
microcircuit
that
not
only
provides
privacy
through
encryption
that
is
substantially
more
robust
than
the
current
government
standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the
keys
needed
to
unlock
the
encryption
the
system
for
the
escrowing
of
keys
will
allow
the
government
to
gain
access
to
encrypted
information
only
with
appropriate
legal
authorization
to
assist
law
enforcement
and
other
government
agencies
to
collect
and
decrypt
under
legal
authority
electronically
transmitted
information
i
hereby
direct
the
following
action
to
be
taken
installation
of
governmentdeveloped
microcircuits
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
her
representative
shall
request
manufacturers
of
communications
hardware
which
incorporates
encryption
to
install
the
us
governmentdeveloped
keyescrow
microcircuits
in
their
products
the
fact
of
law
enforcement
access
to
the
escrowed
keys
will
not
be
concealed
from
the
american
public
all
appropriate
steps
shall
be
taken
to
ensure
that
any
existing
or
future
versions
of
the
keyescrow
microcircuit
are
made
widely
available
to
us
communications
hardware
manufacturers
consistent
with
the
need
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
keyescrow
system
in
making
this
decision
i
do
not
intend
to
prevent
the
private
sector
from
developing
or
the
government
from
approving
other
microcircuits
or
algorithms
that
are
equally
effective
in
assuring
both
privacy
and
a
secure
key
escrow
system
keyescrow
the
attorney
general
shall
make
all
arrangements
with
appropriate
entities
to
hold
the
keys
for
the
keyescrow
microcircuits
installed
in
communications
equipment
in
each
case
the
key
holder
must
agree
to
strict
security
procedures
to
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
the
keys
the
keys
shall
be
released
only
to
government
agencies
that
have
established
their
authority
to
acquire
the
content
of
those
communications
that
have
been
encrypted
by
devices
containing
the
microcircuits
the
attorney
general
shall
review
for
legal
sufficiency
the
procedures
by
which
an
agency
establishes
its
authority
to
acquire
the
content
of
such
communications
procurement
and
use
of
encryption
devices
the
secretary
of
commerce
in
consultation
with
other
appropriate
us
agencies
shall
initiate
a
process
to
write
standards
to
facilitate
the
procurement
and
use
of
encryption
devices
fitted
with
keyescrow
microcircuits
in
federal
communications
systems
that
process
sensitive
but
unclassified

i
expect
this
process
to
proceed
on
a
schedule
that
will
permit
promulgation
of
a
final
standard
within
six
months
of
this
directive
the
attorney
general
will
procure
and
utilize
encryption
devices
to
the
extent
needed
to
preserve
the
governments
ability
to
conduct
lawful
electronic
surveillance
and
to
