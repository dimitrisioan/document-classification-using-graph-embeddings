can
someone
tell
me
if
hardware
compression
is
or
is
not
needed
to
run
digital
speech
down
k
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit
samples
would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to
be
a
good
vocoder
like
ours
will
give
you
bits
per
second
locked
at
full
rate
its
a
variable
rate
voice
activity
vocoder
if
you
want
less
quality
cut
that
to
bps
half
rate
at
full
rate
variable
you
could
put
two
fullduplex
conversations
on
a
vbis
modem
this
requires
a
dsp
or
asics
though
an
rs
has
a
cpu
that
could
probably
do
it
in
realtime
because
it
has
the
addandmultiply
instruction
and
a
few
other
dsp
things
if
you
want
to
do
speech
in
realtime
you
need
about
samples
a
second
for
not
very
good
voice
with
your
bit
samples
isdn
is
bit
samples
a
second
which
is
kbps
you
could
do
a
fast
compression
on
that
to
get
it
down
to
kbps
which
is
just
about
vbis
the
quality
at
this
point
is
very
bleah
but
it
should
work
now
add
in
the
time
for
your
encryption
method
youre
going
to
need
sampling
hardware
which
is
no
problem
on
a
new
mac
an
amiga
or
a
pc
with
a
soundblaster
card
just
because
theyre
so
popular
and
cheap
you
could
also
build
a
simple
adc
the
problem
with
the
soundblaster
is
that
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
full
duplex
you
cant
sample
and
play
backq
at
the
same
time
making
a
twoway
conversation
a
bit
tough
the
special
hardware
or
a
more
capable
sound
card
may
be
required
the
only
thing
that
worries
me
is
that
compression
the
soundblaster
can
do
it
automatically
in
hardware
but
other
than
that
i
dont
have
a
good
feel
for
how
processor
intensive
it
is
so
i
cant
estimate
how
fast
a
pc
youd
need
not
all
men
who
drink
are
poets
some
of
us
drink
because
we
are
not
poets
