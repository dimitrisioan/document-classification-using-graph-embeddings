re
is
this
overreaction
good
points
in
addition
i
would
point
out
that
now
is
one
of
the
best
times
to
fight
this
political
battle
with
much
of
the
opposition
in
disarray
an
fbi
director
sessions
on
his
way
out
an
attorney
general
reno
who
has
only
been
in
long
enough
to
find
the
office
coffee
machine
two
tries
out
of
three
and
between
slow
confirmations
and
clintons
saturday
night
massacre
hasnt
much
of
a
staff
in
place
if
we
really
get
lucky
both
of
the
above
will
be
too
busy
trying
to
keep
their
feet
from
being
held
to
the
waco
fire
to
spend
much
effort
insisting
on
their
alleged
right
to
spy
on
the
american
people
i
swear
to
you
we
arent
finished
