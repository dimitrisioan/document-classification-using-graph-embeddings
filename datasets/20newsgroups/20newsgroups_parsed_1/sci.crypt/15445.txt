oh
great
wonderful
news
nobody
can
listen
inexcept
the
feds
hey
its
better
than
the
status
quo
i
am
far
less
worried
about
the
feds
tapping
my
phone
than
high
school
scanner
surfers
who
get
their
kicks
out
of
eavesdropping
on
cellular
and
cordless
phone
calls
im
a
political
dissident
im
scared
shitless
of
the
feds
listening
in
on
my
calls
my
opinions
are
the
sort
that
would
get
me
disappeared
in
a
slightly
less
free
society
and
who
knows
what
sort
of
society
we
will
be
in
in
five
or
ten
years
i
have
friends
who
have
had
their
phones
tapped
none
of
this
is
theoretical
to
me
as
for
its
better
than
the
status
quo
well
first
of
all
you
can
get
a
cryptophone
from
companies
like
cylink
today
and
they
work
well
in
addition
a
number
of
groups
are
now
working
on
building
software
to
turn
any
pc
into
a
privacy
enhanced
phone
right
now
and
they
are
all
working
in
overdrive
mode
and
yes
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto
restrictions
lifted
but
this
is
at
least
an
incrememental
improvement
for
certain
applications
there
are
no
crypto
restrictions
yet
you
can
use
anything
you
want
right
now
the
point
is
to
maintain
that
right
the
point
you
all
seem
to
have
missed
was
covered
when
the
uk
cellphone
scrambling
system
was
discussed
incidentally
my
mp
has
responded
to
my
questions
on
that
issue
and
it
appears
that
the
uk
and
other
approved
countries
will
get
the
secure
a
encryption
and
dodgy
countries
will
get
ax
existing
mobile
equipment
will
drop
to
clear
mode
when
used
with
ax
systems
but
newer
equipment
will
use
aaxclear
depending
on
the
capabilities
of
the
base
station
the
copsfeds
do
not
need
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
your
private
key
to
listen
in
to
cellular
conversations
encryption
is
not
endtoend
but
cellphone
to
basestation
it
has
to
be
this
way
so
that
cellular
users
and
fixed
installations
can
talk
to
each
other
for
cellular
to
cellular
calls
the
transmission
is
decrypted
at
the
basestation
passed
to
another
basestation
and
reencrypted
the
copsfeds
can
listen
to
the
unscrambled
call
provided
they
get
a
warrant
to
tap
into
the
cellular
providers
equipment
the
only
reason
for
wanting
a
crackable
system
is
so
they
can
listen
without
having
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
maybe
the
clipper
system
is
secure
and
they
really
do
need
a
warrant
to
get
the
key
out
of
escrow
before
they
can
listen
in
using
a
scanner
see
above
they
dont
have
to
go
down
this
route
anyway
i
have
my
doubts
but
even
if
true
once
they
have
the
key
they
will
never
again
need
a
warrant
to
tap
into
that
particular
phone
whenever
they
want
well
judge
it
appears
he
wasnt
a
drugdealer
after
all
so
naturally
well
stop
listening
in
you
have
every
reason
to
be
scared
shitless
take
a
look
at
the
records
of
mccarthy
hoover
j
edgar
not
the
cleaner
though
they
both
excelled
at
sucking
