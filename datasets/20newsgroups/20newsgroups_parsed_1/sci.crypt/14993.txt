i
will
provide
one
hint
it
is
reported
that
rsa
expressed
puzzlement
at
their
conference
that
nobody
has
asked
for
permission
to
use
ripem
to
write
a
pgpcompatible
program
this
actually
supports
bills
speculation
if
there
is
a
backdoor
in
rsaref
and
if
pkp
is
supported
secretly
by
the
nsa
then
it
is
more
than
natural
that
they
will
welcome
any
publickey
implementation
that
uses
rsaref
and
will
strongly
oppose
themselves
against
any
implementation
that
doesnt
i
personally
can
not
see
how
one
could
put
a
backdoor
in
a
longprecision
modular
arithmetic
library
that
comes
in
source
but
of
course
the
fact
that
i
can
not
see
it
means
nothing
