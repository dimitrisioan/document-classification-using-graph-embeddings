subject
re
how
does
it
really
work
was
re
text
of
white
house
announcement
and
qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
from
marc
vanheyningen
the
majority
of
the
discussion
involving
this
clipper
chip
seems
to
pertain
to
the
encryption
of
telephone
conversations
does
anyone
know
if
that
means
this
chip
is
designed
to
work
primarily
with
analog
signals
the
language
sort
of
suggests
this
but
its
hard
to
say
id
lay
a
few
bucks
that
its
just
dataindataout
in
parallel
i
suspect
to
make
it
a
phone
youd
need
a
codec
and
speech
compression
there
would
be
a
loss
of
bandwidth
on
the
speech
signal
which
i
suspect
would
scupper
any
of
the
suggestions
ive
seen
here
about
putting
a
different
encryption
front
end
on
it
theres
no
hint
of
any
modulation
scheme
in
the
docs
im
sure
its
purely
a
digital
chip
the
back
end
will
come
later
but
im
positive
it
wont
be
left
to
the
manufacturers
they
all
have
to
be
the
same
modulation
scheme
to
make
it
easy
for
the
nsa
to
tap
them
the
only
other
possibility
is
that
this
is
intended
only
for
isdn
phones
puts
a
whole
new
spin
on
effs
obsession
about
isdn
if
true
bwahahaha
