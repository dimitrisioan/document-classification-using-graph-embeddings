i
have
lurked
here
a
bit
lately
and
though
some
of
the
math
is
unknown
to
me
found
it
interesting
i
thought
i
would
post
an
article
i
found
in
the
saturday
april
toronto
star
clipper
chip
to
protect
privacy
politics
is
of
course
dirty
pool
old
man
and
here
we
have
a
classic
example
the
nsa
and
the
administration
have
been
working
on
this
for
a
long
time
and
in
parallel
with
the
announcement
to
us
techies
we
see
theyre
hitting
the
press
with
propoganda
its
my
bet
the
big
magazines
byte
scientific
american
et
all
will
be
ready
to
run
with
a
prewritten
governmentslanted
story
on
this
in
the
next
issue
just
keep
us
some
pages
spare
boys
well
give
you
the
copy
in
time
for
the
presses
we
must
get
big
names
in
the
industry
to
write
well
argued
pieces
against
this
proposal
can
you
call
it
that
when
its
a
de
facto
announcement
and
get
them
into
the
big
magazines
before
too
much
damage
is
done
it
would
be
well
worth
folks
archiving
all
the
discussions
from
here
since
the
day
of
the
announcement
to
keep
all
the
arguments
at
our
fingertips
i
think
between
us
we
could
write
quite
a
good
piece
now
who
among
us
carries
enough
clout
to
guarantee
publication
