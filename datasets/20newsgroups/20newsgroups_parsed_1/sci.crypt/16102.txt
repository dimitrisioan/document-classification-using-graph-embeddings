clipper
and
backdoors
david
sternlight
says
it
discredits
the
writer
with
third
parties
to
claim
clipper
has
a
back
door
it
does
not
actually
david
i
dont
think
its
any
more
intellectually
honest
to
say
there
are
no
backdoors
than
to
say
there
are
backdoors
unless
youve
had
a
chance
to
examine
the
algorithm
and
the
silicon
closely
for
all
we
know
skipjack
could
be
easily
broken
or
impossible
to
break
and
clearly
if
skipjack
is
not
secure
then
the
clipper
chip
is
not
worth
much
