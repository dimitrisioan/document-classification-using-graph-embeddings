re
once
tapped
your
code
is
no
good
any
more
in
article
writes
and
some
people
thought
that
i
am
exaggerating
when
claiming
that
the
cripple
chip
is
just
a
first
step
in
a
totalitarian
plot
against
the
civil
liberties
in
the
usa
it
seems
that
ive
even
been
an
optimist
the
things
are
happening
even
faster
than
i
expected
thats
another
of
the
dirty
tricks
they
used
to
apply
on
us
under
the
communist
regime
do
something
secret
then
tell
the
people
about
is
after
the
fact
when
nothing
can
be
done
any
more
and
of
course
explaining
them
how
much
better
the
situation
is
now
in
my
previous
messages
i
wrote
that
the
americans
should
wake
up
and
fight
against
the
new
proposal
now
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
already
too
late
it
has
already
happened
the
civil
liberties
have
been
violated
no
stollen
from
the
american
people
while
the
most
part
of
this
people
has
been
sleeping
happily
too
sad
as
one
of
the
happily
sleeping
people
i
would
just
like
to
ask
this
arent
people
just
slightly
overreacting
to
this
or
are
we
all
of
a
sudden
going
to
draw
parallels
to
nazi
germany
and
communist
russia
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
yes
this
is
a
serious
problem
but
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
guess
what
were
doing
something
now
you
cant
do
in
a
communist
country
or
nazi
germany
were
complaining
about
it
or
rather
youre
complaining
about
it
and
nobody
is
shooting
at
us
or
rather
if
theyre
shooting
at
me
they
have
real
bad
aim
guess
what
people
you
live
in
one
of
the
few
countries
in
the
world
where
a
person
can
complain
without
getting
shot
at
people
are
always
complaining
that
somebody
did
this
wrong
or
somebody
did
that
wrong
or
whatever
sit
down
and
figure
out
two
things
what
have
they
done
right
how
much
worse
can
it
get
and
youll
find
that
you
and
i
are
pretty
damn
lucky
so
lets
talk
about
it
get
some
action
going
decide
whats
going
on
but
lets
not
overreact
