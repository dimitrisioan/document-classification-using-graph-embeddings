its
impossible
to
get
approval
to
attach
any
crypto
device
to
the
phone
network
anything
that
plugs
in
to
our
bt
phone
sockets
must
be
approved
for
some
reason
crypto
devices
just
never
are
whats
the
difference
between
a
vbis
modem
and
a
vbis
modem
im
not
being
entirely
silly
here
what
im
pointing
out
is
that
the
modems
that
they
have
already
approved
for
data
transmission
will
work
just
fine
to
transmit
scrambled
vocoded
voice
absolutely
i
just
meant
that
no
secure
dedicated
crypto
device
has
ever
been
given
approval
guerrilla
underground
devices
should
be
well
possible
with
todays
highspeed
modems
not
that
i
can
think
of
many
vbis
modems
that
are
approved
either
mind
you
just
the
overpriced
couriers
can
someone
tell
me
if
hardware
compression
is
or
is
not
needed
to
run
digital
speech
down
k
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit
samples
would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to
be
reasonably
fancy
standard
voice
circuits
run
at
kbps
interexchange
in
the
us
therefore
you
need
to
achieve
to
get
standard
voice
quality
if
youre
willing
to
give
up
some
quality
you
need
only
this
is
still
acceptable
from
a
speech
standpoint
it
will
be
a
little
less
faithful
to
the
original
but
certainly
intelligable
thats
all
you
really
need
for
this
application
