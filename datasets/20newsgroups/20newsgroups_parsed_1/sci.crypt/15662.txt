wouldnt
a
a
second
monitor
of
similar
type
scrolling
gibberish
and
adjacent
to
the
one
being
used
provide
reasonable
resistance
to
tempest
attacks
it
would
be
in
a
different
location
so
a
directional
antenna
could
probably
lock
in
on
just
the
one
monitor
failing
that
a
phased
array
could
likely
seperate
the
signals
admittedly
this
is
expensive
but
so
is
all
the
rest
of
this
stuff
anyway
