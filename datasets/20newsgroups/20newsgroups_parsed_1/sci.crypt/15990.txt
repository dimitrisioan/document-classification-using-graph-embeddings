dear
secretary
brown
as
you
know
i
have
long
been
interested
in
the
privacy
and
security
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
data
in
a
networked
environment
recent
reports
concerning
the
administrations
endorsement
of
an
electronic
encryption
standard
based
upon
clipper
chip
technology
have
raised
a
number
of
related
issues
the
international
competitiveness
of
us
high
tech
manufacturers
and
the
software
industry
is
a
key
factor
that
the
government
should
consider
when
addressing
issues
of
encryption
and
data
security
as
the
nation
moves
forward
in
developing
the
national
communications
and
information
infrastructure
security
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
network
data
will
be
an
increasingly
important
factor
for
protecting
the
privacy
of
users
the
hacker
community
can
compromise
the
integrity
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
databases
linked
by
the
network
the
people
and
businesses
that
use
the
nations
telecommunications
network
and
the
personal
computers
linked
through
it
increasingly
are
demanding
that
information
be
protected
against
unauthorized
access
alteration
and
theft
i
am
concerned
that
the
administrations
plan
may
mean
that
to
remain
competitive
internationally
us
companies
would
be
compelled
to
develop
two
products
one
for
us
government
customers
and
another
for
private
commercial
users
who
may
want
a
higher
encryption
standard
this
may
inadvertently
increase
costs
to
those
us
companies
hoping
to
serve
both
markets
to
assist
the
subcommittees
analysis
of
this
issue
please
respond
to
the
following
questions
has
the
encryption
algorithm
or
standard
endorsed
by
the
administration
been
tested
by
any
entity
other
than
nsa
nist
or
the
vendor
if
so
please
identify
such
entities
and
the
nature
of
testing
performed
if
not
please
describe
any
plans
to
have
the
algorithm
tested
by
outside
experts
and
how
such
experts
will
be
chosen
under
the
administrations
plan
what
entities
will
be
the
holders
of
the
keys
to
decrypt
scrambled
data
what
procedures
or
criteria
will
the
administration
utilize
to
designate
such
key
holders
does
the
encryption
algorithm
endorsed
by
the
administration
contain
a
trap
door
or
back
door
which
could
allow
an
agency
or
entity
of
the
federal
government
to
crack
the
code
it
is
clear
that
over
time
changes
in
technologies
used
for
communications
will
require
new
techniques
and
additional
equipment
how
will
encryption
devices
adapt
to
the
rapid
advancement
of
telecommunications
technology
what
additional
costs
would
the
proposed
encryption
place
on
the
federal
government
what
is
the
estimated
cost
to
consumers
and
businesses
which
opt
for
the
federal
standard
in
their
equipment
what
is
the
commerce
departments
assessment
of
the
competitive
impact
of
the
administrations
endorsement
of
the
clipper
chip
technology
on
us
exports
of
computer
and
telecommunications
hardware
and
software
products
i
