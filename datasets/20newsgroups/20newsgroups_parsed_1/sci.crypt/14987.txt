lots
of
stuff
i
hate
to
follow
up
to
my
own
posting
but
i
should
perhaps
clarify
some
things
so
i
wont
get
flamed
first
of
all
when
im
talking
about
factoring
the
modulus
or
a
breakthrough
in
factoring
what
i
really
mean
is
a
breakthrough
in
the
cryptanalysis
of
rsa
i
know
that
factoring
and
breaking
rsa
are
not
proven
to
be
equivalent
its
just
so
damn
convenient
not
to
repeat
this
every
time
i
also
have
to
admit
that
i
dont
really
know
if
the
nongroup
property
of
a
cipher
is
essential
only
for
key
chaining
i
have
thought
about
it
a
little
while
but
i
cant
find
a
way
that
a
cryptanalyst
could
exploit
a
group
structure
that
of
course
means
nothing
at
all
then
i
wrote
please
note
that
as
long
as
it
is
much
harder
to
factor
a
rsa
modulus
than
it
is
to
generate
it
the
increase
in
computer
speed
alone
will
keep
key
lengths
and
modulus
factoring
in
lockstep
ie
people
will
simply
start
using
longer
moduli
and
still
be
safe
what
i
meant
was
that
as
long
as
the
only
advantage
of
the
cryptanalyst
is
a
faster
computer
then
we
will
probably
have
rsa
for
a
long
time
to
come
because
even
if
bit
moduli
somehow
could
be
broken
with
fast
computers
not
with
a
new
algorithm
then
people
would
simply
use
longer
moduli
both
users
and
cryptanalysts
benefit
from
better
technology
in
the
same
way
hope
this
keeps
the
flames
away
have
fun
