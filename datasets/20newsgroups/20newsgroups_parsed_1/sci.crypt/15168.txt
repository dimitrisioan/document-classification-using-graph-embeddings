this
came
up
because
i
decided
to
configure
up
mitmagiccookie
security
for
xr
for
this
to
work
you
need
to
stick
some
bits
that
an
intruder
cant
guess
in
a
file
readable
only
by
you
which
x
client
applications
read
they
pass
the
bits
back
to
the
server
when
they
want
to
establish
a
connection
what
i
settled
on
was
grabbing
a
bunch
of
traffic
off
the
network
basically
i
ran
etherfind
u
x
greater
compress
and
skipped
over
k
of
output
then
grabbed
my
bits
as
best
i
can
tell
these
are
bits
that
can
be
expected
to
be
reasonably
uniformly
distributed
and
quite
unguessable
by
an
intruder
for
your
application
what
you
can
do
is
to
encrypt
the
realtime
clock
value
with
a
secret
key
