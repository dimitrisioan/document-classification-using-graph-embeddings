whats
the
difference
between
a
vbis
modem
and
a
vbis
modem
how
fast
do
the
fastest
modems
go
how
far
can
voice
be
compressed
ive
seen
various
assertions
about
this
but
anyone
with
the
straightforward
bitspersecond
figures
will
be
my
friend
forever
how
about
half
a
friend
the
motorola
codex
preliminary
vfast
modem
which
you
can
by
right
now
does
kbps
raw
over
standard
phone
lines
kbps
is
what
is
usually
claimed
for
the
final
vfast
but
you
cant
go
out
and
buy
that
right

the
standard
isnt
done
yet
again
voice
can
be
compressed
quite
well
down
to
or
bps
depending
on
how
good
you
want
it
to
be
but
that
requires
a
dsp
or
a
special
asic
to
do
in
realtime
