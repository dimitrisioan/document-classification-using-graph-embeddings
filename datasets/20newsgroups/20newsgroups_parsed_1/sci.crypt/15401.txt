more
technical
details
here
are
some
corrections
and
additions
to
hellmans
note
courtesy
of
dorothy
denning
again
this
is
reposted
with
permission
two
requests
first
note
the
roles
of
s
and
s
it
appears
to
me
and
others
that
anyone
who
knows
those
values
can
construct
the
unit
key
and
the
nature
of
the
generation
process
for
k
and
k
is
such
that
neither
can
be
produced
alone
thus
the
scheme
can
not
be
implemented
such
that
one
repository
generates
the
first
halfkey
and
another
generates
the
second
that
is
ominous
second
these
postings
are
not
revealed
scripture
nor
are
they
carefullycrafted
spook
postings
dont
attempt
to
draw
out
hidden
meanings
as
opposed
to
say
the
official
announcements
of
clipper
leave
denning
out
of
this
given
hellmans
record
of
opposition
to
des
which
goes
back
before
some
folks
on
this
newsgroup
knew
how
to
read
i
dont
think
you
can
impugn
his
integrity
oh
yeah
the
folks
who
invented
clipper
arent
stupid
if
you
think
something
doesnt
make
sense
its
almost
certainly
because
you
dont
understand
their
goals
steve
bellovin
date

apr
edt
from
dorothy
denning
subject
re
clipper
chip
to
a
long
list
of
folks
i
was
also
briefed
by
the
nsa
and
fbi
so
let
me
add
a
few
comments
to
martys
message
the
clipper
chip
will
have
a
secret
crypto
algorithm
embedded
in
the
algorithm
operates
on
bit
blocks
like
des
and
the
chip
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
uses
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
in
des
in
addition
to
the
system
key
each
user
will
get
to
choose
his
or
her
own
key
and
change
it
as
often
as
desired
call
this
key
plain
old
k
when
a
message
is
to
be
sent
it
will
first
be
k
is
the
session
key
shared
by
the
sender
and
receiver
any
method
eg
public
key
can
be
used
to
establish
the
session
key
in
the
att
telephone
security
devices
which
will
have
the
new
chip
the
key
is
negotiated
using
a
publickey
protocol
encrypted
under
k
then
k
will
be
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
uk
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
added
to
produce
a
three
part
message
which
will
then
be
encrypted
under
the
system
key
sk
producing
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
my
understanding
is
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
will
also
check
it
out
but
this
is
am
sunday
so
i
did
not
want
to
wait
the
unit
key
will
be
generated
as
the
xor
of
two
bit
random
numbers
k
and
k
ukkk
which
will
be
kept
by
the
two
escrow
the
unit
key
also
called
the
chip
key
is
generated
from
the
serial
number
n
as
follows
let
n
n
and
n
be
bit
blocks
derived
from
n
and
let
s
and
s
be
two
bit
seeds
used
as
keys
compute
the
bit
block
r
eden
s
s
s
note
that
this
is
like
using
the
des
in
triple
encryption
mode
with
two
keys
similarly
compute
blocks
r
and
r
starting
with
n
and
n
im
unlear
about
whether
the
keys
s
and
s
change
the
fact
that
theyre
called
seeds
suggests
they
might
then
r
r
and
r
are
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
form
k
and
the
next
bits
form
k
the
remaining
bits
are
discarded
authorities
who
these
escrow
authorities
will
be
is
still
to
be
decided
by
the
attorney
general
but
it
was
stressed
to
me
that
they
will
not
be
nsa
or
law
enforcement
agencies
that
they
must
be
parties
acceptable
to
the
users
of
the
system
as
unbiased
marty
is
right
on
this
and
the
fbi
has
asked
me
for
suggestions
please
pass
them
to
me
along
with
your
reasons
in
addition
to
martys
criteria
i
would
add
that
the
agencies
must
have
an
established
record
of
being
able
to
safeguard
highly
sensitive
information
some
suggestions
ive
received
so
far
include
sri
rand
mitre
the
national
labs
sandia
lanl
los
alamos
treasury
gao
when
a
court
order
obtains
k
and
k
and
thence
k
the
law
enforcement
agency
will
use
sk
to
decrypt
all
information
flowing
on
the
suspected
link
aside
it
is
my
guess
that
they
may
do
this
constantly
on
all
links
with
or
without
a
court
order
since
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
which
links
over
which
a
message
will
flow
my
understanding
is
that
there
will
be
only
one
decode
box
and
that
it
will
be
operated
by
the
fbi
the
service
provider
will
isolate
the
communications
stream
and
pass
it
to
the
fbi
where
it
will
pass
through
the
decode
box
which
will
have
been
keyed
with
k
for
the
wiretap
authorizations
when
levy
asked
for
the
details
so
he
could
review
the
cases
as
required
by
law
the
agent
told
him
that
his
predecessors
just
turned
over
blank
signed
forms
every
time
levi
did
not
comply
and
changed
the
system
but
the
lesson
is
clear
no
single
person
or
authority
should
have
the
power
to
authorize
wiretaps
no
single
person
does
at
least
for
fbi
taps
after
completing
a
mound
of
paperwork
an
agent
must
get
the
approval
of
several
people
on
a
chain
that
includes
fbi
legal
counsel
before
the
request
is
even
taken
to
the
attorney
general
for
final
approval
