second
question
why
why
is
such
a
strange
procedure
used
and
not
a
real
rng
this
turns
those
ss
in
a
kind
of
bottleneck
for
system
security
the
only
theory
that
makes
any
sense
is
that
s
and
s
are
either
the
same
for
all
chips
or
vary
among
very
few
possibilities
so
that
anyone
trying
to
break
the
encryption
by
brute
force
need
only
plow
through
the
possible
serial
numbers
about
one
billion
multiplied
by
the
number
of
different
s
s
combinations
suppose
instead
that
s
and
s
can
be
reconstructed
given
or
of
the
unit
keys
generated
in
a
single
batch
through
some
sort
of
known
plaintext
attack
say
suppose
further
that
or
of
the
chips
programmed
in
each
session
never
find
their
way
into
commercial
products
but
instead
end
up
elsewhere
suppose
the
folks
at
elsewhere
can
determine
a
unit
key
given
physical
access
to
one
of
these
chips
then
those
same
folks
can
determine
s
and
s
for
the
whole
batch
too
many
suppositions
yeah
probably
pat
