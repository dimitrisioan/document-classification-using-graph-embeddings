first
note
that
the
experts
will
only
look
at
details
and
of
just
the
algorithm
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
why
not
the
chip
design
well
heres
the
possiblity
in
addition
to
encryption
the
chip
preprocesses
voice
signals
to
make
them
easier
to
analyzetranscribe
electronically
the
chip
once
widespread
might
effectively
be
part
of
a
massively
parallel
computer
for
voice
grepping
the
us
phone
network
or
the
criminal
wrongthinking
patrons
thereof
first
of
all
the
chip
doesnt
do
that
it
runs
at
megabitssecond
which
is
far
beyond
what
you
need
for
voice
its
obviously
intended
for
data
as
well
and
on
highspeed
lines
at
that
second
what
advantage
is
there
to
doing
the
processing
in
the
phone
i
dont
care
how
fancy
that
chip
is
its
not
as
fancy
as
the
roomful
of
analyzers
at
fort
meade
running
the
program
theyll
have
years
from
now
they
cant
update
every
clipper
chip
thats
out
there
third
if
they
did
do
this
preprocessing
in
the
chip
it
would
probably
have
a
serious
effect
on
recognizability
of
the
voice
patterns
if
nothing
else
that
would
hurt
the
acceptability
of
the
product
the
vbis
modems
are
just
barely
fast
enough
to
do
a
good
job
on
properly
massaged
voice
as
is
add
any
more
to
the
mix
and
youre
completely
out
of
the
ballpark
