can
someone
tell
me
if
hardware
compression
is
or
is
not
needed
to
run
digital
speech
down
k
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit
samples
would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to
be
its
all
easy
with
a
dsp
the
olivetti
quaderno
for
example
great

pc
sorry
for
the
plug
folks
but
olivetti
dont
seem
to
be
doing
a
good
job
marketing
it
themselves
includes
sound
digitisation
hardware
they
provide
vocoders
for
their
dsp
which
produce
varous
bitrates
theres
one
which
gives
pretty
acceptable
voice
quality
at
kbitsec
just
right
for
a
vbis
modem
their
dsp
can
play
and
record
at
the
same
time
too
so
you
wouldnt
need
to
play
twowayradio
you
can
also
download
code
to
the
dsp
subunit
though
youd
need
a
software
development
kit
for
the
dsp
in
question
dunno
which
it
is
if
you
wanted
to
produce
your
own
vocoder
for
say
v
speeds
