ok
i
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
nsas
infamous
control
over
encryption
export
through
the
itar
heres
a
question
say
i
develop
this
great
new
encryption
system
and
i
want
to
sell
my
software
worldwide
the
thought
police
then
come
in
and
say
this
algorithm
is
a
threat
to
national
security
you
will
not
be
permitted
to
export
it
at
this
point
what
kind
of
trouble
could
i
get
into
if
i
ignored
the
itar
and
sold
my
program
to
international
customers
anyway
first
of
all
its
not
the
thought
police
its
the
export
police
if
you
move
overseas
with
your
great
thoughts
in
your
head
write
the
software
there
and
then
sell
it
the
us
thought
police
probably
cant
do
too
much
about
it
though
you
might
want
to
check
with
your
lawyer
first
however
if
you
write
the
program
here
and
sell
it
to
furriners
you
are
now
an
international
arms
dealer
and
can
get
thrown
in
the
clink
for
many
years
especially
if
they
decide
youd
be
a
good
example
and
cuban
drug
dealers
and
fanatic
middle
eastern
terrorists
buy
your
stuff
definitions
of
public
domain
are
different
for
itar
purposes
so
if
youve
got
a
good
enough
lawyer
wholl
do
your
case
for
free
after
theyve
confiscated
everything
you
own
as
evidence
you
might
win
but
nobody
wants
to
go
first
since
the
stakes
are
quite
high

for
peace
