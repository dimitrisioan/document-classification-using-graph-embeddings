since
the
law
requires
that
wiretaps
be
requested
by
the
executive
branch
and
approved
by
the
judicial
branch
it
seems
clear
that
one
of
the
key
registering
bodies
should
be
under
the
control
of
the
judicial
branch
i
suggest
the
supreme
court
or
regionally
the
courts
of
appeal
more
specifically
the
offices
of
their
clerks
ive
got
a
better
idea
we
give
one
set
to
the
kgb
co
washington
embassy
and
the
other
set
to
the
red
chinese
imho
one
should
place
the
keybanks
into
satellites
space
the
recovery
should
be
done
only
by
highly
visible
teams
of
astronauts
