ok
i
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
nsas
infamous
control
over
encryption
export
through
the
itar
heres
a
question
say
i
develop
this
great
new
encryption
system
and
i
want
to
sell
my
software
worldwide
the
thought
police
then
come
in
and
say
this
algorithm
is
a
threat
to
national
security
you
will
not
be
permitted
to
export
it
at
this
point
what
kind
of
trouble
could
i
get
into
if
i
ignored
the
itar
and
sold
my
program
to
international
customers
anyway

you
would
be
arrested
as
an
international
arms
trafficker
there
are
several
things
in
itar
which
have
never
been
tested
in
court
the
concensus
appears
to
be
you
could
be
arrested
as
an
international
arms
trafficker
you
could
regardless
of
the
state
of
the
law
but
there
are
some
paragraphs
which
suggest
you
would
be
violating
the
law
if
it
goes
to
court
the
itars
could
be
thrown
out
is
incompatible
with
the
first
amendment
or
the
court
could
rule
that
software
is
technical
data
not
subject
to
the
itars
or
the
court
could
rule
that
the
phrase
publicly
available
as
defined
in
the
itars
would
apply
making
it
only
subject
to
requiring
a
general
export
license
or
you
could
be
prosecuted
successfully
for
arms
trafficing
or
espionage
general
concensus
among
lawyers
who
have
read
the
itars
is
that
one
of
the
first
two
would
occur
