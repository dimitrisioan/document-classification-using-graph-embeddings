how
far
can

be
compressed
celp
manages
to
sound
decent
at
bps
in
theory
if
you
built
a
speech
recognition
system
that
turned
voice
into
ascii
and
a
perfect
synthesis
system
on
the
other
end
that
sounded
just
like
the
person
you
were
speaking
to
you
could
get
it
down
to
the
information
content
of
the
speech
with
various
kinds
of
lpc
you
can
get
it
down
to
bps
or
prehaps
even
less
at
which
point
it
sounds
horrible
bps
is
more
than
adequite
for
our
purposes
