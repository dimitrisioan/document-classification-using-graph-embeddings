oh
great
wonderful
news
nobody
can
listen
inexcept
the
feds
hey
its
better
than
the
status
quo
i
am
far
less
worried
about
the
feds
tapping
my
phone
than
high
school
scanner
surfers
who
get
their
kicks
out
of
eavesdropping
on
cellular
and
cordless
phone
calls
it
would
be
stupid
to
rely
on
even
a
clipperized
channel
for
truly
sensitive
material
but
it
does
seem
to
finally
offer
a
reasonable
way
to
guard
against
casual
eavesdropping
for
example
even
with
my
strong
right
to
bear
arms
view
of
the
private
right
to
possess
and
use
strong
cryptosystems
the
system
as
described
provides
enough
security
that
i
would
actually
buy
a
cordless
phone
and
would
be
much
less
wary
of
using
cellular
phones
walkietalkies
and
so
on
as
long
as
its
only
used
for
massmarket
voice
scrambling
i
actually
dont
see
a
problem
with
it
if
you
want
more
security
than
it
offers
use
something
different
use
pkcs
for
electronic
mail
celp
over
des
or
triple
des
with
diffiehellman
key
exchange
for
your
voice
traffic
or
whatever
and
yes
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto
restrictions
lifted
but
this
is
at
least
an
incrememental
improvement
for
certain
applications
