you
write
suppose
i
knew
how
the
algorithm
worked
and
knew
the
n
for
my
chip
but
did
not
know
f
then
by
cryptanalysis
i
might
be
able
to
determine
f
from
if
law
enforcement
field
eek
u
n
f
not
knowing
n
would
might
make
this
much
harder
theyre
betting
that
you
cant
do
this
even
if
you
know
n
even
if
you
know
e
in
fact
which
theyre
trying
to
keep
secret
if
you
can
find
e
by
grinding
down
the
chip
presumably
you
can
find
f
as
well
but
we
cant
do
this
right
now
with
des
even
knowing
the
encryption
method
without
doing
almost
the
whole
bit
search
that
is
not
true
with
chosen
plaintext
attacks
des
keys
can
be
determined
without
the
full
search
now
suppose
that
i
know
f
either
legitimately
or
not
if
i
know
k
either
because
i
am
involved
in
the
conversation
or
i
know
u
for
a
party
in
the
conversation
i
may
now
be
able
to
determine
u
for
the
other
party
again
theyre
betting
that
you
cant
find
u
given
k
ie
they
claim
the
encryption
is
strong
trust
us
i
am
not
willing
to
take
that
bet
if
i
know
f
i
can
also
defeat
the
law
enforcement
field
since
i
could
make
my
own
with
a
different
k
then
the
one
i
am
using
knowing
f
also
allows
traffic
analysis
to
be
performed
so
i
might
not
know
what
you
are
saying
but
i
could
know
who
you
are
saying
it
too
im
not
sure
therell
be
a
way
to
shove
arbitrary
key
and
data
through
your
chip
but
if
so
this
parts
ok
were
assuming
e
is
unknown
you
can
obviously
shove
arbitrary
data
through
your
chip
as
for
the
key
it
is
stated
that
the
sesion
key
exchange
is
external
to
the
chip
so
i
can
pick
my
keys
too
now
i
admit
that
someone
trying
to
compute
u
will
not
have
lots
of
messages
to
work
from
but
since
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
key
generation
method
does
not
deliberately
generate
weak
keys
or
for
that
matter
that
the
published
method
is
in
fact
used
perhaps
the
us
will
be
chosen
from
know
weak
keys
for
the
system
they
assume
that
you
wont
be
able
to
find
u
no
matter
how
many
messages
you
have
if
they
could
break
u
they
wouldnt
need
the
key
escrow
bing
bing
bing
bing
bing
that
exactly
my
point
since
we
cant
know
that
they
do
not
have
this
capability
the
only
safe
assumption
is
that
they
do
i
admit
that
most
of
my
cryptographic
complaints
are
probably
unfounded
but
since
we
cant
know
one
way
or
the
other
im
not
gonig
to
take
their
word
for
it
obviously
the
compromise
of
f
would
be
a
disaster
both
to
law
enforcement
for
whom
this
whole
thing
is
designed
and
for
the
people
who
believe
that
it
is
giving
them
security
f
is
but
one
number
and
i
sure
that
alot
of
people
more
then
know
what
it
is
and
if
some
panel
of
experts
is
going
to
check
it
over
for
flaws
then
many
more
will
know
f
forget
grinding
chips
bribery
and
blackmail
work
just
fine
its
not
clear
that
the
experts
will
be
told
f
in
fact
id
be
surprised
id
expect
something
more
of
the
form
of
the
fips
pub
describing
des
so
that
they
could
look
at
the
algorithm
in
general
rather
than
with
the
specific
set
of
keys
chosen
oh
come
on
thats
like
saying
you
could
evaluate
des
without
the
sbox
constants
