have
successfully
used
one
on
a
toshiba
laptop
by
enabling
bit
of
port
xf
and
controlling
bit
of
port
xa
for
the
direction
of
data
flow
ie
for
output
for
input
the
same
code
does
not
work
on
my
desktop
machine
i
have
heard
that
i
might
have
to
use
bit
of
port

however
this
also
does
not
work
for
a
parallel

been
running
a
