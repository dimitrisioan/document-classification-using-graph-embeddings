i
have
a
friend
with
an
original
hp
laserjet
the
nameplate
does
not
specify
a
number
but
since
the
lj
ii
followed
later
one
assumes
that
he
has
a
lj
i
his
problem
is
a
tax
program
which
requires
a
cpi
font
to
print
the
forms
properly
this
unit
came
to
market
in
versions
the
plus
version
supported
dowloadable
fonts
you
can
guess
which
one
my
friend
has
the
plain
not
the
plus
the
printer
does
though
have
a
slot
and
he
has
a
small
selction
of
cartridges
including
a
cpi
but
none
with
a
cpi
font
can
anyone
suggest
a
source
for
a
cartridge
with
a
or
cpi
font
alternatively
is
an
upgrade
to
the
plus
version
available
at
reasonable
cost
any
suggestions
would
be
welcome
thanks
