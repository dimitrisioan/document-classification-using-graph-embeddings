i
have
just
installed
a
diamond
stealth
isa
card
in
a
dx
system
with
k
cache
and
megs
of
memory
that
gets
about
a
si
cpu
benchmark
rating
using
the
xx
color
driver
under
windows
i
am
getting
a
winbench
winmarks
rating
of
only
about
million
since
i
have
heard
that
others
get
to
million
for
this
card
i
assume
that
something
is
very
wrong
with
my
setup
what
are
some
possible
causes
of
the
card
slowing
down
like
this
most
importantly
which
winbench
version
are
you
using
on
my
local
bus
ati
graphics
ultra
pro
ive
gotten
various
winbench
scores
from
million
to
million
winmarks
depending
on
the
version
winbench
gives
the
most
optimistic
scores
gives
the
least
a
winmark
rating
is
meaningless
without
a
corresponding
version
