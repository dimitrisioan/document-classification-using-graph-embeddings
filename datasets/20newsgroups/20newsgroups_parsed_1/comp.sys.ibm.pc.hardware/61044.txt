how
is
a
null
modem
c
a
humble
response
to
a
letter
by
gordon
lang
written
gl
i
am
interrested
in
the
extrodinarily
simple
concept
of
the
null
gl
modem
cable
actually
i
have
no
idea
so
dont
count
that
last
gl
statement
what
im
asking
is
what
pins
does
it
use
or
what
are
gl
its
specifications
i
just
want
to
solder
one
myself
instead
of
gl
buying
one
i
dont
even
know
what
port
is
used
you
may
want
to
save
yourself
the
trouble
and
go
to
radio
shack
they
have
a
null
modem
adapter
which
is
a
pin
connector
that
swaps
the
necessary
pins
to
allow
two
machines
to
communicate
these
are
a
lot
easier
than
soldering
the
connections
yourself
and
usually
a
bit
more
reliable

the
eating
