re
ide
vs
scsi
i
almost
got
a
hernia
laughing
at
this
one
if
anything
scsi
on
a
pc
will
be
obsolete
killed
off
by
vesa
local
bus
ide
it
must
be
real
nice
to
get
shafted
by
bucks
for
the
extra
cost
of
a
scsi
drive
then
pay
another
for
a
scsi
controller
first
off
with
all
these
huge
software
packages
and
files
that
they
produce
ide
may
no
longer
be
sufficient
for
me
mb
limit
second
rumor
is
microsoft
recognizes
the
the
importance
of
scsi
and
will
support
it
soon
im
just
not
sure
if
its
on
dos
win
or
nt
at
any
rate
the
deal
is
with
corel
who
makes
i
hear
a
good
cohesive
set
of
scsi
drivers
