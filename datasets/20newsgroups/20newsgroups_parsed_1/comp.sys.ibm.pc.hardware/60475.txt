re
ide
vs
scsi
how
do
you
do
busmastering
on
the
isa
bus
by
initiating
a
dma
xfer
seriously
busmastering
adapter
have
their
own
dma
ability
they
dont
use
the
motherboards
onboard
dmawhich
is
much
slower
isa
has
no
bus
arbitration
so
if
two
busmastering
cards
in
isa
system
try
to
do
dma
xfers
on
the
same
dma
channel
the
system
will
lock
or
crashi
forget
their
are
dma
channels
in
an
isa
system
are
bit
are
bit
the
system
uses
dma
a
soundblaster
uses
dma
i
could
buy
a
busmastering
xga
video
card
a
busmastering
scsi
ha
in
order
for
them
to
work
properly
i
would
have
to
find
out
what
dma
channel
the
xga
card
uses
and
then
simply
configure
the
scsi
ha
to
use
a
different
dma
channel
for
its
dma
xfers
i
dont
know
if
multiple
dma
xfers
can
go
on
at
the
same
time
on
isa
im
not
sure
if
they
can
on
eisa
systems
either
i
do
know
that
on
eisamca
systems
you
can
allow
bm
cards
to
use
the
same
dma
channel
thanks
