re
ide
vs
scsi
dave
write
are
we
talking
about
a
scsi
device
eg
hd
on
a
scsi
controller
or
are
we
talking
about
a
scsi
controller
that
had
a
chip
upgrade
using
the
same
chip
that
is
on
a
scsi
controller
board
we
are
talking
about
a
scsi
device
eg
hd
on
a
scsi
controller
here
is
a
rewrite
of
my
mac
info
sheet
scsi
section
scsi
only
external
device
expansion
interface
common
to
both
mac
and
ibm
allows
the
use
of
any
device
hard
drive
printer
scanner
nubus
card
expansion
mac
plus
only
some
monitors
and
cdrom
normal
asynchronous
scsi
is
mhz
fast
synchronous
scsi
is
mhz
difference
between
these
modes
is
mainly
in
the
software
drivers
main
problem
there
are
a
lot
of
external
devices
which
are
internal
terminated
which
causes
problems
for
more
then
two
devises
off
the
scsi
port
a
scsi
chain
is
supposed
to
be
terminated
only
at
the
begining
and
end
any
other
set
up
causes
problems
for
either
mac
or
ibm
scsi

bit
scsi
is
often
mistaken
for
a
fast
version
of
scsi
see
scsi
for
details
scsi
fully
scsi
compliant
scsi
mode
devices
per
scsi
controller
bit
scsi
is
implimented
as
a
very
fast
scsi
since
it
can
run
using
scsi
hardware
and
software
drivers
which
limits
it
to
devices
which
results
in
it
sometimes
being
mistakenly
consitered
part
of
scsi
bit
and
bit
scsi
require
different
ports
electronics
and
scsi
software
drivers
from
scsi
which
makes
them
more
expensive
than
other
scsi
interfaces
bit
scsi
seems
to
run
only
in
synchronous
mode
hence
term
wide
and
fast
scsi
transfer
speeds
are
mbs
with
mbs
burst
bit
mbs
with
mbs
burst
bit
and
mbs
with
mbs
burst
bit
bit
scsi
is
the
biggest
headache
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
scsi
that
i
know
of
that
can
pump
scsi
speeds
through
scsi
devices
and
software
controlers
its
main
implimentation
is
on
the
mac
though
you
do
see
adds
for
scsi
at
mbs
maximum
throughput
for
pcs
since
bit
scsi
does
not
need
all
the
hardware
including
electonics
and
software
of
bit
and
bit
scsi
it
is
the
cheepest
of
the
scsi
interfaces
just
pop
out
the
scsi
electornics
and
pop
in
bit
scsi
electronics
some
people
consider
bit
where
scsi
really
starts
i
used
to
be
one
of
them
but
mbs
average
though
put
with
a
theoretical
burst
of
mbs
is
not
scsi
but
is
bit
scsi
rule
of
thumb
if
it
is
scsin
and
over
mbs
then
it
is
some
type
of
scsi
bit
scsi
can
use
part
of
scsi
electronics
which
further
reduces
its
cost
compared
to
and
bit
scsi
