point
of

why
does
scsi
have
an
advantage
when
it
comes
to
multi
tasking
data
is
data
and
it
could
be
anywhere
on
the
drive
can
scsi
find
it
faster
can
it
get
it
off
the
drive
and
into
the
computer
faster
does
it
have
a
better
cache
system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing
a
data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more
than
one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
mbs
max
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the
isa
bus
first
you
can
quote
scsi
specs
till
youre
blue
in
the
face
but
if
they
exceed
the
isa
bus
capability
then
whats
the
point
who
said
isa
was
necessary
eisa
or
vlb
are
the
only
interfaces
worth
investing
thousands
of
dollars
eg
a
new
pcs
worth
of
money
in
who
says
ide
is
limited
to
megssec
what
about
vlbide
does
anyone
know
how
they
perform
you
didnt
read
to
carefully
vlbide
uses
the
same
connection
mechanism
as
standard
ide
if
transfer
rate
is
limited
by
ide
whether
its
interfaced
to
isa
eisa
or
vlb
matters
not
so
at
its
lowest
setting
scsi
interface
in
asynchronous
scsi
mode
averages
the
through
put
maximum
of
ide
in
asynchronous
mode
in
full
scsi
mode
it
blows
poor
ide
out
the
window
down
the
street
and
into
the
garbage
can
as
implimented
on
what
system
on
mine
for
one
thing
scsi
blows
ide
out
of
the
water
hands
down
if
ide
has
better
throughput
why
isnt
it
used
on
workstations
and
file
servers
the
problem
becomes
can
the
drive
mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rates
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
scsi
comes
from
not
the
interface
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisims
to
use
the
scsi
through
put
given
the
original
question
scsi
used
only
as
a
single
hard
drive
controller
is
it
then
necessary
to
get
a
scsi
drive
that
will
do
at
least
maybe
megssec
for
the
scsi
choice
to
make
any
sence
what
does
a
meg
megssec
scsi
drive
cost
no
thats
the
nice
thing
on
a
multitasking
os
scsi
can
use
both
drives
at
once
ive
got
unix
loaded
on
one
of
my
pcs
along
with
windogs
and
the
os
can
only
use
one
of
the
two
ide
drives
at
one
time
its
pretty
ugly
i
just
bought
at
quantum
for
my
mac
at
home
i
paid
for
it
i
havent
seen
ide
drives
cheaper
the
original
cga
cart
back
in
was
i
think
the
original
ega
card
or
pga
was
scsi
has
stood
relatively
alone
in
not
coming
down
in
price
mainly
because
were
talking
about
pcs
and
not
suns
or
sparc
or
sgi
or
name
your
favorite
unix
workstation
that
is
after
millions
of
pc
buying
decisions
over
the
years
scsi
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
come
down
in
price
no
actually
were
talking
about
scsi
being
expensive
simply
because
nobody
did
a
common
interface
for
the
pc
if
they
had
a
common
read
easily
implemented
method
of
adding
scsi
to
a
pc
like
as
in
a
sun
or
mac
then
youd
find
scsi
the
connection
medium
of
choice
i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bus
when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
on
a
single
drive
scsi
is
more
expensive
but
you
bought
your
pc
for
expandibility
so
youd
want
to
add
more
drives
or
whatever
the
following
are
why
i
find
scsi
intrinsically
better
than
ide
a
partial
list
you
can
add
many
different
types
of
devices
and
access
them
concurrently
a
scsi
device
works
on
many
different
machines
i
have
a
mac
and
a
pc
at
home
and
moving
hard
drives
between
them
is
very
nice
with
scsi
hook
them
up
and
away
they
go
scsi
devices
work
together
better
than
ide
devices
for
instance
recently
i
added
an
older
connor
meg
ide
to
a
maxtor
meg
ide
the
connor
must
be
setup
as
the
slave
it
will
work
no
other
way
on
scsi
you
set
the
address
check
the
termination
plug
it
in
and
away
it
goes
i
have
a
problem
with
ides
mutual
exclusion
i
notice
that
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
accessing
drive
c
to
drive
d
is
quite
long
as
compared
to
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
drive
c
to
d
on
a
scsi
system
under
a
multitasking
os
this
is
very
noticable
as
many
things
can
be
going
on
at
once
one
neat
thing
that
ive
noticed
lately
a
fringe
benefit
has
been
the
ability
to
add
older
almost
dead
drives
as
storage
on
a
scsi
system
with
little
problem
weve
got
a
bunch
of
almost
dead
meg
drives
that
ive
added
to
my
pc
ive
now
got
the
interface
full
but
it
does
allow
me
to
have
meg
drives
meg
drive
tape
drive
and
meg
drive
all
on
the
same
card
simply
put
scsi
is
handier
than
ide
no
mysterious
jumpers
to
figure
out
greg
you
cant
go
against
nature
because
when
you
do
greg
shaw
go
against
nature
its
part
of
nature
too
love
rockets
