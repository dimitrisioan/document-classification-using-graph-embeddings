this

my
modem
doesnt
have
any
of
these
on
hardware
can
a
jcl
software
implemented
protocol
do
the
trick
there
is
a
software
version
of
mnp
available
from
mtez
and
it
will
often
connect
with
other
modems
that
are
mnp
compatible
but
if
the
modem
that
you
theres
also
a
program
called
odyssey
modem
directory
on
the
simtel
archives
that
emulates
mnp
and
others
too
i
think
but
these
were
what
i
was
interested
in
i
was
getting
a
lot
of
garbage
when
i
called
one
number
and
mnp
cleared
it
up
completely
on
my
ordinary
modem
fortunately
the
remote
end
had
an
mnp
modem
i
tried
mnp
too
but
it
seemed
to
lock
up
the
computer

mileage
