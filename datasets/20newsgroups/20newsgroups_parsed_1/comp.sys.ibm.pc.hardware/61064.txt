re
scsi
vs
ide
writes
do
all
scsi
cards
for
dos
systems
require
a
separate
device
driver
to
be
loaded
into
memory
for
each
scsi
device
hooked
up
no
all
that
ive
seen
have
also
an
onboard
bios
which
enables
you
to
use
up
to
hard
drives
directly
under
dos
drives
is
a
dos
limitation
and
you
have
the
same
problem
with
ide
and
all
other
standards
for
that
matter
software
drivers
often
allow
for
better
performance
though
you
have
to
use
them
if
you
want
to
use
other
devices
besides
hard
disks
or
have
more
than
disks
will
this
also
be
true
of
the
bit
oss
obviously
these
are
not
able
to
use
the
bit
real
mode
bioses
that
are
written
for
dos
so
you
need
software
drivers
thats
not
a
big
deal
as
long
as
the
drivers
are
available
because
you
wont
have
to
fight
with
any
low
memory
problems
either
segmented
memory
helps
structure
software
