subject
beyond
k
trident
and
lots
more
hi
i
have
a
few
enquiries
about
pcs
and
compatibles
in
general
some
software
others
hardware
orientated
probably
the
wrong
newsgroup
as
everyone
claims
anyway
does
any
one
happen
to
have
the
board
jumper
details
for
a
trident
svga
graphics
card
mb
or
even
what
the
dip
switches
do
on
the
end
mine
already
works
fine
albeit
slow
and
after
having
blown
up
a
monitor
i
found
out
which
switch
controlled
the
interlacenon
interlace
facility
but
im
curious
as
to
why
there
are
dip
switches
on
the
card
with
apparantly
little
use
secondly
does
anyone
know
why
commodore
had
to
be
so
crazed
in
their
design
of
the
pc
motherboard
with
respect
to
the
ram
ie
or
k
can
anyone
supply
pin
details
for
the
expansion
ports
for
a
pc
or
bit
or
even
a
sample
circuit
to
cause
an
irq
when
a
button
is
pressed
yeah
i
know
its
a
piece
of
cake
im
lazy
software
wise
anyone
care
to
divulge
some
tips
on
accessing
expanded
ram
on
a
pc
from
a
program
written
in
turbo
c
for
instance
using
farcoreleft
and
coreleft
return
only
memory
available
from
the
base
k
regardless
of
combinations
of
emm
etc
etc
what
i
want
is
to
be
able
to
use
the
ram
above
and
beyond
the
mb
boundary
im
not
certain
whether
farmalloc
new
actually
uses
it
anyway
but
ill
suspect
not
also
what
half
brained
wit
created
dos
so
as
not
to
be
reentrant
as
a
follow
on
does
anyone
have
any
comments
about
the
use
of
dos
calls
to
c
from
within
a
dos
interrupt
ie
will
changing
the
stack
size
on
entry
be
of
use
two
articles
ive
read
on
the
subject
have
given
conflicting
views
does
anyone
have
any
views
on
writing
direct
to
screen
memory
in
terms
of
portability
many
thanks
got
ta
go
bars
closing
soon
cheers
ian
