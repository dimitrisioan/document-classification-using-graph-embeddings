ide
controller
card
for
my
vlb
dx
motherboard

good
options
for
this

disk
compression
sw
i
have
a
maxtor
mb
on
an
isa
ide
controller
although
my
machine
is
dx
vlb
i
has
the
save
transfer
rate
of
mbs
regardless
of
the
variations
of
the
isa
bus
speed
i
tested
it
with
speed
between
mhz
and
mhz
not
any
difference
the
problem
is
not
the
interface
between
the
controller
and
the
memory
