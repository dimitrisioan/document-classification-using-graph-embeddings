seven
vramii
board
that
only
came
with
k
at
the
time
this
was
ok
but
i
need
info
or
help
with
upgrading
this
board
to
mbyte
there
are
rows
of
pins
over
the
vram
chips
i
think
for
a
piggyback
board
of
vram
i
would
like
to
hear
from
anyone
that
may
be
able
to
help
me
upgrade
this
board
maybe
someone
from
headland
who
maybe
read
ing
this
has
one
of
these
piggyback
boards
just
laying
around
please
please
please
does
anyone
know
of
where
i
could
maybe
buy
the
upgrade
for
this
i
would
sure
love
to
use
this
in
x
color
mode
but
for
the
time
being
i
can
only
get
of
the
screen
with
the
bottom
part
a
white
strip
obviously
because
of
the
missing
vram
actually
im
surprised
it
even
works
to
this
degree
at
all
as
a
last
resort
i
will
wind
up
selling
this
board

last
resort
post
to
this
group
