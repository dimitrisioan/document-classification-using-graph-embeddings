what
a
weekend
i
replaced
my
motherboard
upgraded
to
dos
ms
windows
and
now
experience
lockups
in
any
windows
application
using
the
modem
dxdxl
cpu
amd
ami
bios
io
card
with
serial
parallel
and
game
ports
generic
cheapo
ide

fd
internal
packard
bell
modem
mouse
the
mouse
is
set
to
com
irq
via
jumper
on
the
io
board
and
parms
on
the
mouse
driver
the
modem
is
set
to
com
irq
jumpers
on
modem
board
in
addition
i
think
i
have
disabled
the
second
serial
port
on
the
io
card
since
it
is
unused
mouse
works
fine
heres
the
deal
procomm
dos
version
works
fine
through
the
modem
procomm
for
windows
cim
compuserve
for
windows
and
terminal
all
lockup
when
i
try
to
do
anything
with
the
modem
the
screen
just
freezes
no
sound
comes
from
the
modem
nor
any
messages
on
the
screen
im
getting
real
frustrated
could
the
second
port
on
the
io
card
still
be
enabled
would
this
cause
a
problem
ive
been
through
most
of
the
software
routes
so
im
beggining
to
believe
that
maybe
this
is
a
hardware
problem
anybody
been
through
a
similar
experience
anybody
have
any
ideas
i
could
try
please
thanks
in
advance

i
ran
into
the
same
problem
when
i
upgraded
from
a
modem
to
a
modem
any
time
i
give
the
modem
a
reset
command
atz
while
in
windows
the
computer
locks
up
if
i
give
the
atz
command
in
dos
it
will
work
my
solution
was
to
not
give
the
modem
the
atz
command
thru
windows
in
the
procomm
install
process
i
told
the
program
i
have
a
hayes
compatible
modem
atz
was
not
included
in
the
initialization
string
it
works
fine
i
called
ms
about
this
they
didnt
have
a
clue
as
to
what
the
memoryinterupt
conflict
could
be
the
lockup
accures
using
any
windows
comm
program
that
gives
the
atz
command
