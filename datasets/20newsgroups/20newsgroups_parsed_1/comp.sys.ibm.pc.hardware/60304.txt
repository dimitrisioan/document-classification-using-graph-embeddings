am
looking
for
an
inexpensive
vlb
card
and
have
yet
to
run
across
any
real
reviews
of
them
one
of
the
cards
the
local
stores
are
pushing
is
the
genoa
for
apparently
it
uses
a
cirrus
logic
acc
chip
but
i
dont
know
which
one
gd
one
of
the
shops
ive
spoken
with
claims
the
card
outperforms
the
diamond
stealth
vl
and
the
orchid
fahrenheit
plus
vl
cards
s
c
based
but
that
cant
be
true
if
it
is
using
the
gd
i
like
the
price
of
the
genoa
but
if
it
lags
in
performance
behind
the
s
cards
ill
pay
the
extra
for
one
of
them
any
info
on
low
end
vlb
