netware
server
a
and
s
on
wayne
mcdougall
had
the
unmitigated
gall
to
say
this
wm
the
software
is
netware
level
ii
and
i
can
see
burnt
on
to
the
wm
screen
sft
netware
level
ii
va
however
to
configure
netware
wm
for
level
ii
mirrored
or
duplexed
disks
requires
a
second
disk
yes
yes
mirroring
requires
a
controller
that
is
capable
of
writing
to
two
disks
at
once
duplexing
which
is
the
preferred
way
of
mirroring
uses
two
controller
cards
and
two
disk
drives
duplexing
requires
a
special
card
and
two
identical
disk
drives
in
most
cases
duplexing
can
sometimes
be
pulled
off
with
slightly
different
drivescontrollers
as
long
as
the
sizes
are
the
same
wm
so
how
is
the
novell
server
a
normally
configured
the
configuration
is
completely
up
to
the
user
wm
can
i
install
sft
netware
level
ii
va
as
level
i
or
is
this
wm
what
is
causing
my
serialization
error
if
you
only
have
one
disk
then
you
cant
use
level
ii
sft
however
the
osobj
disk
has
a
serial
number
on
it
and
if
this
disk
is
for
a
different
version
of
netware
then
you
would
get
a
serialization
error
make
sure
that
this
disk
actually
belongs
to
the
rest
of
the
set
of
floppies
in
the
netware
installation
set
wm
is
the
novell
server
a
normally
equipped
with
two
hard
drives
wm
one
of
which
has
failed
two
drives
could
be
either
two
netware
volumes
at
sft
i
or
one
volume
mirrored
using
sft
ii
impossible
to
tell
with
the
network
being
down
wm
would
this
mean
i
can
not
install
the
network
software
because
it
wm
will
not
be
serialized
for
this
hardware
with
a
failed
drive
try
disconnecting
the
failed
drive
using
a
standard
disk
controller
and
installing
the
software
as
one
volume
under
sft
i
if
the
software
will
install
and
if
the
one
disk
is
functional
then
it
should
be
able
to
work
in
this
configuration
wm
what
else
can
cause
a
serialization
error
see
the
comment
concerning
the
serial
number
on
the
osobj

floppy
