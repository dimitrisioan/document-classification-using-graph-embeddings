i
finally
decided
to
upgrade
my
eisas
memory
from
meg
to
meg
two
months
after
the
parts
warranty
ran
out
on
the
anigma
motherboard
two
months
too
late
it
seems
theres
a
problem
with
one
or
both
of
the
two
mmxbit
sim
slots
in
bank
b
on
boot
i
get
a
pattern
test
failure
at
address
xa
and
the
system
deconfigures
the
top
meg
the
sims
are
good
i
tried
rotating
all
of
them
into
bank
a
on
one
of
the
configurations
however
the
pattern
test
deletions
failed
at
x
in
all
tests
the
pattern
that
appeared
was
the
same
as
the
pattern
if
no
sim
was
in
place
this
leads
me
to
believe
the
one
or
two
of
the
connector
address
pins
are
at
fault
and
with
a
lot
of
luck
might
be
patchable
