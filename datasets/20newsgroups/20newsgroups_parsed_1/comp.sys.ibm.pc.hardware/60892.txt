says
what
is
the
difference
between
the
us
robotics
courier
vbis
external
and
the
sportster
external
i
see
that
the
price
of
a
sportster
has
dramatically
dropped
to
below
but
the
price
of
the
courier
remains
above
anyone
with
knowledge
of
both
of
these
modems
or
anyone
that
owns
a
courier
the
courier
is
their
topoftheline
product
thus
the
higher
price
ive
never
taken
a
real
look
at
the
sportster
line
only
couriers
but
from
what
ive
gathered
its
basically
more
of
an
entrylevel
modem
probably
doesnt
meet
the
same
specifications
that
the
courier
does
im
not
sure
if
the
sportster
line
is
fully
dsp
driven
like
the
more
recent
courier
modems
are
so
upgrades
in
the
future
may
be
an
issue
again
take
all
of
the
above
with
a
grain
of
saltive
never
evaluated
the
sportster
so
im
going
by
bits
and
pieces
that
ive
heard
if
you
want
a
real
answer
post
the
question
in
compdcommodems
and
youll
find
people
who
have
worked
with
the
sportster
personally
though
if
i
were
going
to
look
at
the
courier
modems
id
buy
the
dual
standardthen
id
get
both
hst
and
vbis
in
fact
this
is
exactly
what
i
did
im
sitting
here
looking
at
my
usr
ds
right
now
and
now
to
correct
a
few
very
incorrect
statements
folks
if
you
want
to
get
reliable
answers
to
modem
andor
uart
questions
post
them
to
compdcommodems
if
you
post
in
other
groups
you
never
know
what
youll
get
in
the
way
of
an
answer
you
may
very
well
get
a
good
answeror
you
may
get
something
like
the
one
below
at
least
in
cdm
if
someone
posts
complete
and
utter
bs
youll
see
a
flurry
of
folks
correcting
them
to
avoid
spreading
faulty
info
the
sportster
at
has
v
error
control
and
v
bis
data
compression
just
as
it
does
at
lower
speeds
too
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
either
ccitt
recommendation
v
or
vbis
that
says
that
they
can
only
operate
on
modems
that
are
running
vbis
vbis
of
course
is
currently
only
standardized
for
operation
on
top
of
v
in
its
primary
mode
of
operation
lapm
but
thats
about
as
far
as
that
goes
and
just
in
case
theres
some
confusion
on
this
vvbis
are
also
supported
by
the
courier
line
unless
you
have
a
really
ancient
one
the
difference
with
the
courier
is
that
it
can
run
at
and
only
in
the
hst
mode
take
a
second
look
at
the
original
question
in
a
previous
article
holly
ks
says
what
is
the
difference
between
the
us
robotics
courier
vbis
external
see
the
vbis
up
there
the
question
was
not
about
the
courier
hst
modem
or
about
the
courier
dual
standardit
was
about
the
courier
vbis
modem
the
modem
in
question
does
not
support
hst
period
it
therefore
does
not
support
the
kb
hst
also
not
all
courier
hst
courier
dual
standard
modems
support
the
kb
version
of
hst
my
dual
standard
only
supports
hst
at
kb
there
are
even
older
models
that
only
run
hst
at
kb
this
is
a
proprietary
mode
of
usr
and
it
will
only
connect
to
another
of
the
same
type
unit
to
achieve
this
speed
hst
is
usrs
proprietary
modulation
scheme
but
were
not
talking
about
hst
were
talking
about
vbis
vbis
is
most
definitely
not
a
proprietary
modulation
scheme
the
sportster
will
do
asynchronous
transmissions
as
well
as
synchronous
the
hst
is
one
way
only
i
do
hope
you
didnt
mean
for
these
two
sentences
to
be
related
in
some
way
first
off
v
and
vbis
are
both
synchronous
and
asynchronous
this
is
part
of
the
ccitt
recommendation
ie
part
of
the
standard
it
isnt
a
feature
unique
to
the
sportster
i
just
looked
at
the
appropriate
chapter
in
the
courier
ds
manual
second
hst
is
not
one
way
only
more
correctly
put
it
is
an
asymmetrical
modulation
scheme
meaning
it
doesnt
work
at
the
same
speed
in
both
directions
hst
operates
at
in
one
direction
and
has
a
lowspeed
backchannel
in
the
other
direction
the
highspeed
channel
goes
in
the
direction
of
the
higher
data
flow
this
is
fine
if
youre
logged
on
to
say
a
bbs
and
type
one
letter
and
get
screens
of
info
back
transfer
files
not
using
bimodem
etc
there
is
of
course
a
penalty
for
turnaround
time
when
the
highspeed
channel
needs
to
reverse
directions
v
and
vbis
are
both
symmetrical
meaning
they
do
transfer
the
full
data
rate
in
both
directions
at
the
same
time
third
synchronous
vs
asynchronous
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
symmetrical
vs
asymmetricalthey
are
two
completely
different
topics
the
hsts
will
be
upgradeable
to
the
vfast
spec
when
it
is
available
again
more
correctly
put
some
of
the
courier
line
will
be
upgradeable
to
whatever
vfast
is
called
when
its
complete
if
you
have
the
large
footprint
courier
modems
like
i
do
youre
sol
there
was
an
upgrade
plan
a
while
back
to
upgrade
to
a
small
footprint
variety
which
could
eventually
be
upgraded
to
support
vfast
but
the
cost
of
the
two
upgrades
together
pretty
much
put
it
higher
than
just
buying
a
new
modem
later
