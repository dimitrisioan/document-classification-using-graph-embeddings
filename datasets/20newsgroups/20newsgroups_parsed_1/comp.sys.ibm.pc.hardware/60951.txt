vfast
whats
taking
so
long
in
article
robert

writes
why
is
it
going
to
take
a
year
for
vfast
to
become
a
standard
are
there
technical
problems
to
work
out
or
is
it
just
bureaucratic
slowdown
thanks
dont
even
get
hyped
up
they
are
still
accepting
submissions
from
the
members
for
various
proposals
of
how
to
implement
the
standard
you
dont
seem
to
realize
that
while
vbis
was
just
an
extension
of
v
which
took
years
to
pass
implement
and
finally
sell
at
a
reasonable
price
vfast
requires
all
new
technology
not
just
faster
dsp
chips
etc
to
achieve
its
performance
wait
until
next
spring
for
the
final
ratification
and
modems
coming
shortly
after
that
bing
ho
university
of
california
at
berkeley
