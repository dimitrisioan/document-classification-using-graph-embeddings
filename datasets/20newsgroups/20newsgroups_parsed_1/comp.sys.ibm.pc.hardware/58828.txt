does
anyone
know
of
a
software
that
can
exchange
caps
lock
and
ctrl
keys
on
the
atstyle
keyboard
im
looking
for
a
memory
resident
program
that
can
work
with
other
programs
rather
than
a
feature
in
a
specific
program
i
am
aware
of
a
shareware
program
back
and
forth
that
provides
this
feature
within
that
program
thanks
a
program
in
the
archive
keymapzip
on
simtel
and
mirror
sites
in
the
msdoskeyboard
directory
will
do
this
it
is
written
in
assembler
and
it
best
if
you
have
a
compiler
to
create
a
new
keyboard
map
it
is
possible
however
to
use
a
binary
editor
to
edit
the
provided
compiled
keyboard
driver
if
you
do
not
have
a
compiler
i
used
hexedzip
also
available
on
simtel
simply
serach
for
the
codes
to
locate
the
biginning
of
the
normal
keyboard
map
then
swap
the
codes
for
the
keys
that
you
wish
to
swap
see
the
keyboard
directory
of
simtel
for
programs
that
report
the
scancode
for
each
key
to
you
some
bios
programs
also
have
this
info
good
luck
