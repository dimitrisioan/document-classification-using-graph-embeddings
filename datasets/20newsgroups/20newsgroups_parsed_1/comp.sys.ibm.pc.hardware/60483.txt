question
re
diamond
speedstar
x
the
jp
on
the
speedstar
x
is
for
those
systems
with
bootup
problems
if
your
system
fails
to
bootup
proprtly
please
pull
off
the
jumper
block
from
jp
this
will
not
affect
the
proformance
of
the
speedstar
x
this
is
what
my
manual
says
about
jp
i
never
knew
that
it
was
there
but
the
card
is
a
real
ask
kicker
in
my
book
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
my
junk
sony
s
to
the
point
that
i
cant
even
use
above
x
mode
muchsam
some
times
an
upgrage
turns
out
to
be
a
big
overkill
like
driving
a
sony
with
a
x
that
the
monitor
cant
handle
or
installing
ns
simms
and
then
finding
out
that
your
mother
board
doesnt
have
a
cmos
wait
state
adjustment
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
ns
simms
that
you
just
bought
goshi
think
i
just
installed
a
virusit
was
called
ms
dos
dont
copy
that
floppyburn
iti
just
love
