warning
on
copy
ii
pc
board
help
on
copying
in
mitch
writes
now
does
anyone
know
a
way
to
back
up
the
masters
of
wordperfect
for
windows
windows
and
norton
so
i
can
send
another
copy
to
my
permanent
noncollege
address
for
safekeeping
students
keep
borrowing
my
masters
and
im
worried
theyll
get
screwed
up
please
dont
tell
me
you
realize
of
course
that
inevitably
some
anal
retentive
moron
is
going
to
come
along
and
wag
his
fingers
and
his
jowls
in
outrage
that
personal
politics
are
more
important
than
smcapboldfontgod
ptthe
lawsmcapboldfont
but
thats
irrelevant
to
the
problem
here
windows
came
with
my
system
but
on
disks
i
hate
using
disks
so
i
copied
them
over
to
high
density
s
using
xcopy
it
worked
fine
in
fact
for
a
while
i
was
changing
configurations
and
whatnot
so
much
that
i
decided
to
try
putting
them
on
the
hard
disk
not
only
can
you
copy
them
over
with
one
disk
per
directory
but
if
you
want
to
you
can
simply
copy
them
all
into
one
directory
makes
it
a
lot
nicer
when
youre
switching
printer
emulations
around
norton
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
but
when
a
friends
system
crashed
we
restored
from
a
backup
rather
than
from
the
originals
and
it
worked
fine
this
would
imply
that
arj
a
r
norton
cnu
would
create
a
workable
backup
and
if
you
did
a
full
install
the
first
time
youve
got
the
whole
thing
never
played
with
wp
for
windows
im
not
too
big
of
a
fan
of
anything
from
utah
good
luck
disclaimer
dont
copy
that
floppy
