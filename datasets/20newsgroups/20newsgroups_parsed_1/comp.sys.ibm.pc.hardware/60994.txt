a
couple
of
months
ago
i
tried
out
a
hercules
graphite
card
a
pretty
nice
board
fairly
fast
and
seemed
quite
compatible
even
seemed
to
handle
the
svga
modes
i
have
whined
about
here
on
occasion
at
the
time
i
was
just
buying
a
vlb
system
so
after
checking
out
the
card
i
sent
it
back
i
wanted
a
vlb
card
and
purchased
a
fahrenheit
vlb
card
this
card
is
fairly
fast
will
do
hz
refresh
at
x
but
is
not
compatible
with
my
cdroms
the
svga
thing
i
think
i
have
merely
conjectured
that
is
the
cause
of
an
old
graphics
board
being
able
to
run
in
a
higher
resolution
with
those
programs
than
the
modern
boards
i
have
tried
i
have
not
gotten
a
straight
answer
out
of
anybody
the
monitor
i
am
using
it
with
is
a
magnavox
which
also
tops
out
at
xx
hz
so
its
really
a
pretty
good
match
but
that
is
for
my
wife
i
just
purchased
a
viewsonic
for
myself
and
am
looking
for
a
graphics
card
to
drive
it
i
want
hz
refresh
and
would
really
like
it
to
handle
my
cdroms
i
tried
the
orchid
p
which
did
neither
of
those
things
though
robert
at
wietek
did
say
that
the
hz
was
possible
if
i
modifed
the
driver
data
base
so
my
thoughts
go
back
to
hercules
they
were
supposed
to
be
coming
out
with
a
vlb
version
of
the
graphite
around
the
end
of
march
i
have
heard
precisely
zero
about
it
since
then
does
anyone
know
if
the
card
was
actually
released
and
what
capabilities
and
price
it
has
any
info
would
be
most
appreciated
