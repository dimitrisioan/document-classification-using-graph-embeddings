ide
vs
scsi

in

magazine
april
although
scsi
is
twice
as
fasst
as
esdi
faster
than
ide
and
support
up
to
devices
its
acceptance
has
long
been
stalled
by
incompatability
problems
and
installation
headaches
note
what
it
does
not
site
as
a
factor
price
there
is
a
premium
of
approx
for
the
controller
what
is
nice
is
being
able
to
run
hard
disks
tape
drives
cdroms
and
scanners
of
one
dma
channel
and
interupt
scsi
makes
sense
is
you
are
going
to
load
up
a
machine
if
you
just
want
a
standard
box
for
windows
then
ide
makes
sense
i
have
one
loaded
box
that
uses
scsi
and
run
unix
and
one
standard
box
that
runs
doswindows
that
uses
ide
by
standard
i
mean
mb
ram
mh
disk
s
video
int
eh
same
article
the
pc
would
will
get
plug
and
play
scsi
from
the
article
it
seems
you
get
plug
and
play
scsi
only
since
scsi
in
full
implimentation
has
ten
not
devices
i
beleive
this
last
bit
is
just
plain
wrong
scsi
intergration
is
sited
as
another
part
of
the
microsoft
plug
and
play
program
