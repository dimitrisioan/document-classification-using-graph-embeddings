i
dont
think
you
can
mix
the
two
types
of
drive
unless
you
have
one
of
the
scsiide
cards
that
is
available
you
will
have
to
turn
your
ide
off
is
this
true
i
was
under
the
impression
that
people
on
the
net
had
both
scsi
and
ide
working
together
i
have
had
a
scsi
and
ide
drive
working
together
for
some
years
now
scsi
is
supposedly
pretty
transparent
to
other
types
of
drives
esdirllideetc
but
oftentimes
you
need
to
get
the
correct
drivers
to
get
it
to
work
with
odd
environments
for
information
purposes
i
had
st
card
stn
drive
and
a
maxtor
a
drive
with
generic
ide
controller
running
together
i
have
also
had
the
same
scsi
setup
work
in
combination
with
a
rll
drive
the
st
drive
