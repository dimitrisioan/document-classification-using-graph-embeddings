like
to
add
a
second
s
based
video
card
to
my
system
does
anyone
know
of
a
company
that
sells
a
card
that
can
coexist
with
another
one
all
i
really
need
is
color
text
on
one
monitor
and
fast
color
graphics
on
the
other
probably
just
a
configurable
address
would
do
it
for
what
its
worth
i
havent
confirmed
it
a
diamond
techrep
told
me
that
all
sbased
video
cards
use
port
addresses
xe
and
xe
if
this
is
true
it
appears
that
you
can
not
use
more
than
one
s
card
in
your
system
actually
there
is
an
sbased
card
on
the
market
that
supports
multiple
adapters
in
one
system
unfortunately
it
is
vlbus
only
they
may
have
an
isa
version
by
now
from
a
company
called
metheus
the
address
and
phone
number
is
metheus
corp
ogc
science
park
nw
compton
dr
beaverton
or
be
aware
this
is
a
very
highend
card
capable
of
mb
of
vram
so
it
does
not
come
cheap
but
i
have
personally
seen
two
of
these
boards
running
a
dual
screen
windows
