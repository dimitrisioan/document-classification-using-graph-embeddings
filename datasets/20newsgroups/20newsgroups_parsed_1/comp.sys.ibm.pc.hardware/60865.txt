upgrading
the
processor
on
machines
in
case
anyone
was
wondering
about
upgrading
their
or
class
machine
without
spending
a
lot
of
money
i
looked
into
replacing
the
processor
on
those
machines
and
here
are
the
facts
as
i
understand
them
if
you
have
a
ps
model
or
model
you
can
replace
the
i
chip
with
either
a
cyrix
dlc
chip
for
which
will
increase
your
processing
power
by
about
for
normal
fuctions
and
not
at
all
for
math
functions
this
chip
will
only
run
at
your
original
clock
speed
ie
if
you
have
a
mhz
machine
the
cyrix
dlc
will
run
at
mhz
note
windows
does
not
use
the
math
functions
so
it
is
a
good
upgrade
if
you
are
running
windows
or
you
can
get
a
kingston
now
platform
for
with
a
mhz
isx
on
it
which
will
increase
your
normal
processing
power
by
about
if
you
were
running
at
mhz
originally
but
again
it
will
not
increase
the
speed
of
your
math
fuctions
i
think
that
it
will
continue
to
run
at
mhz
even
if
your
original
processor
runs
at
a
slower
speed
there
is
also
the
kingston
now
platform
for
with
a
mhz
idx
on
it
this
might
speed
up
your
math
functions
as
well
but
i
am
not
sure
if
you
have
a
ps
model
b
or
other
ps
machine
with
either
an
isx
or
a
nonclock
doubling
idx
ie
it
runs
at
either
or
mhz
in
it
then
you
can
get
an
intel
overdrive
chip
which
is
really
an
idx
chip
and
replace
your
chip
with
it
you
should
get
about
better
preformance
for
both
normal
and
math
functions
the
mhz
version
of
the
overdrive
chip
costs
and
the
mhz
version
costs
the
replacement
for
the
mhz
sx
chip
is
an
espeacially
good
deal
as
it
provides
the
math
coprocessor
which
the
sx
does
not
have
note
that
the
speed
ratings
on
the
overdrive
chips
are
the
maximum
speed
at
which
they
can
run
if
you
have
a
mhz
sx
then
the
overdrive
chip
will
run
at
mhz
ie
mhz
externally
and
mhz
internally
there
is
no
reason
to
buy
an
overdrive
chip
which
is
rated
at
faster
then
your
machine
you
will
not
get
faster
performance
you
should
be
able
to
buy
these
chips
from
any
of
the
microchip
merchants
that
advertise
at
the
back
of
pc
magazine
or
pc
week
you
might
want
to
shop
around
as
prices
do
vary
if
you
need
a
namephone
number
for
a
source
for
a
particular
chip
email
me
and
i
will
respond
with
a
couple
of
sources
