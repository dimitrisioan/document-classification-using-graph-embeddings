there
is
one
param
in
the
bios
setup
that
says
at
bus
clk
i
have
s
it
set
to
the
default
of
but
was
able
to
get
it
to
work
with
s
the
si
at
was
something
i
didnt
want
to
mess
anything
up
s
so
i
set
it
back
to
also
the
pc
didnt
boot
with
it
set
at
s
s
what
exactlt
dows
this
do
and
should
i
leave
it
at
i
think
its
impossible
to
let
atbus
operated
too
much
more
than
mhz
i
have
a
c
t
neat
mother
board
and
i
set
the
atbus
clock
to
mhz
but
the
hd
stopped
when
it
boot
so
its
correct
that
clkn
means
how
many
wait
states
sm
i
think
it
all
depends
on
your
motherboard
and
the
cards
you
have
in
your
system
your
hd
stopped
boot
probably
because
your
hd
controller
cant
handle
the
faster
bus
speed
i
have
a
dx
i
set
my
bus
divider
to
clk
that
is
close
to
mhz
i
can
gain
singificant
performace
increase
on
my
video
card
and
harddisk
transfer
rate
when
i
boost
the
bus
speed
and
my
system
work
flawlessly
under
this
setting
and
you
know
what
when
i
go
to
clkmhz
bus
my
hd
refuse
to
boot
just
my
cent
