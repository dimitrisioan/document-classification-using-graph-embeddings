cpu
fans

just
got
a
mhz
dx
system
and
am
considering
getting
a
fan
for
the
cpu
the
processor
when
running
is
too
hot
to
touch
so
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
good
idea
long
ago
when
i
did
some
electronics
training
i
read
somewhere
that
the
regions
within
a
chip
that
define
junctionsgates
etc
slowly
diffuse
over
time
and
this
increases
with
temperature
hence
a
hot
chip
goes
offspec
sooner
has
anyone
out
there
got
a
cpu
fan
yes
is
there
more
than
type
yes
seen
glueon
tapeon
clipon
oneinch
square
and
larger
my
favorite
is
the
inch
plastic
ustoyo
fan
i
use
just
plopped
down
on
top
of
the
chip
during
opencase
service
do
you
have
to
remove
the
cpu
from
its
scoket
to
install
the
fan
depends
on
the
mounting
do
all
cpu
fans
derive
their
power
from
spare
drive
power
lines
only
if
the
manufacturer
was
smart
anyone
had
any
trouble
with
cpu
fans
only
if
it
goes
out
got
that
blanket
effect
which
doesnt
help
chip
life
does
anyone
have
any
evidence
that
cpu
fans
are
a
complete
waste
of
money
longer
system
life
makes
good
economic
sense
to
me
how
are
these
fans
attached
glue
clips
melted
cheese
yes
well
not
the
melted
cheese
roughly
how
much
cooler
will
the
cpu
be
with
a
fan
as
opposed
to
without
lets
you
touch
the
surface
the
rule
of
thumb
for
cooling
solidstate
an
advert
ive
read
claims
f
vs
f
any
info
appreciated
the
attached
fans
look
slick
and
work
well
but
im
bothered
by
the
potential
loss
of
cooling
if
the
fan
goes
out
at
least
with
the
power
supply
fan
you
can
reach
back
there
every
few
days
and
feel
the
fan
blowing
i
prefer
to
put
a
stock
fan
off
the
drive
brackets
or
front
panel
to
blow
air
across
the
cpu
depends
a
lot
on
case
and
board
layout
though
onchip
fans
from
frys
electronics
in
the
sf
bay
area
are
about
i
get
the
stock
power
supply
fans
for
about
steve
