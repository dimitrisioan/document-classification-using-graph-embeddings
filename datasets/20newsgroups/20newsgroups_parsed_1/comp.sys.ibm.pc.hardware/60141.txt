dont
they
always
of
course
theyre
so
much
more
expensive
than
most
other
quality
competitors
like
who
frinstance
when
i
bought
my
system
november
no
first
second
or
third
tier
vendor
could
touch
the
price
for
the
hardwaresoftware
combination
i
got
from
gw
another
good
thing
i
have
read
in
the
midst
of
all
the
gateway
horror
stories
if
you
were
selling
as
many
systems
as
fast
as
gw
youd
end
up
with
four
or
five
pissedoff
customers
too
and
four
or
five
ecstatic
ones
and
lots
of
satisfied
ones
they
have
an
excellent
return
policy
dont
minimize
this
if
you
buy
mail
order
its
a
good
thing
to
know
that
youll
get
replacements
parts
no
questions
asked
in
a
day
or
two
via
fedex
theyre
very
impressive
systems
when
they
work
which
they
do
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
remember
that
its
only
the
people
on
the
tails
of
the
curve
who
are
motivated
to
write
the
ones
who
love
it
and
the
ones
who
hate
it
you
dont
hear
from
the
folks
in
the
middle
very
often
they
have
rough
edges
no
doubt
about
it
but
they
give
good
value
per
dollar
and
use
almost
all
topquality
components
