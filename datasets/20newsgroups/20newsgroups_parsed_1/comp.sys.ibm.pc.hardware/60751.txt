i
have
a
colorado
memory
systems
jumbo
tape
backup
unit
in
my
gateway
v
tower
system
i
have
found
the
supplied
backup
capability
to
be
fairly
unreliable
in
approx
cases
out
of
i
have
had
the
backup
fail
at
one
point
or
another
often
hanging
in
the
middle
of
writing
the
tape
seek
errors
drive
communication
errors
seem
to
be
most
common
i
use
the
dos
backup
software
from
colorado
memory
systems
should
i
return
the
drive
get
some
better
backup
software
reformat
the
tapes
am
using
cms
tapes
any
hints
would
be
appreciated
this
stuff
is
to
timeconsuming
to
do
over
and
over
again
until
it
cooperates
ive
been
using
an
identical
setup
except
for
the
tower
config
for
several
months
now
from
previous
discussions
on
the
net
the
first
thing
to
check
for
is
dma
conflicts
with
other
devices
especically
if
youve
got
any
funky
ones
next
off
suspect
your
tape
try
a
fresh
one
good
luck
