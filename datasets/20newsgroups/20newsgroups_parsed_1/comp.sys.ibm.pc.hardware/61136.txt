vs

date

would
someone
be
willing
to
explain
to
me
the
dx
mhz
is
not
more
popular
than
it
is
i
would
think
it
would
be
just
as
fast
if
not
faster
than
the
dx
mhz
for
certian
applications
plus
a
mhz
motherboard
would
seem
better
if
you
had
any
plans
on
upgrading
the
chip
in
the
future
i
must
be
missing
something
since
everyone
is
buying
the
dx
many
adds
dont
even
mention
the
dx
thanks
a
lot

its
realy
simple
no
one
makes
a
mother
board
that
runs
the
bus
at
more
than
mhzsam
which
bus
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
mhz
motherboards
are
harder
to
get
right
mhz
need
a
fast
l
cache
ns
is
a
good
idea
mhz
needs
to
be
slowed
down
to
make
a
compliant
vesa
bus
mhz
dx
chips
are
faster
for
a
lot
of
things
with
a
good
fast
l
cache
a
dx
is
going
be
be
faster
than
a
dx
what
do
i
have
a
dx
of
course
