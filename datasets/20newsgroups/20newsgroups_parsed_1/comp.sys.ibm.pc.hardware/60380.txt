help
with
decision
im
buying
a
new
system
this
week
to
replace
my
brain
dead
and
could
use
some
feedback
on
a
couple
systems
im
looking
at
if
anyone
is
familiar
with
them
the
system
that
looks
the
most
interesting
is
the
budget
vlb
tower
for
about
delivered
it
offers
vlb
mb
mb
ide
a
mitsumi
cdrom
with
software
bundle
media
vision
sound
board
ctx
ni
k
cache
and
the
usual
drives
ports
os
software
since
my
budget
is
for
a
system
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
which
may
mean
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
of
course
among
other
things
ive
never
seen
a
review
of
the
budget
systems
or
their
parent
company
micro
smart
or
of
the
motherboard
they
are
using
the
aetana
any
feedback
would
be
appreciated
in
a
similar
vein
the
second
system
im
considering
midwest
micros
elite
vesa
tower
with
a
diamond
viper
mb
midwest
micro
mi
monitor
is
one
ive
never
seen
reviewed
anywhere
im
familiar
with
the
firm
but
not
the
product
line
and
some
idea
of
their
quality
would
be
abig
benefit
here
as
well
any
other
suggestions
in
the
price
range
would
be
appreciated
my
greatest
needs
are
speed
and
graphics
capabilities
email
response
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks
the
only
purpose
for
which
power
can
be
rightfully
exercised
over
any
member
of
a
civilized
community
against
his
will
is
to
prevent
harm
to
others
his
own
good
either
physical
or
moral
is
not
a
sufficient
warrant
