i
just
have
an
ide
controller
a
multiio
board
with
ser
par
port
and
a
vga
board
should
i
choose
another
irq
besides
or
is
irq
safe
to
use
on
motherboards
recently
i
was
adding
a
modem
to
my
computer
and
i
noticed
that
lpt
uses
irq
and
so
does
my
sb
card
h
ive
never
had
a
problem
but
im
just
wondering
why
not
i
thought
this
would
cause
a
conflict
i
would
also
like
an
explanation
of
this
if
anyone
can
explain
why
the
sb
pro
and
lpt
can
share
an
irq

so
thanks
