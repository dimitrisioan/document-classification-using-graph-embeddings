sorry
another
gateway
posting
i
never
thought
id
contribute
to
a
gateway
thread
either
pro
or
con
but
my
spleen
could
use
a
little
venting
the
scenario
ordered
a
dx
w
ultrastor
f
local
bus
hd
controller
receive
system
days
after
ordering
happy
discover
ultrastor
f
isa
hd
controller
inside
unhappy
call
gateway
receive
the
correct
controller
in
days
getting
happier
new
controller
doesnt
work
unhappy
again
call
gateway
again
get
another
controller
in
more
days
cooling
off
the
end
is
in
sight
this
controller
doesnt
work
either
motherboard
is
bad
very
unhappy
gateways
solution
they
will
order
me
a
new
motherboard
more
days
and
have
onsite
service
install
it
for
me
but
i
have
to
take
a
day
off
of
work
because
the
service
people
only
work
mf
i
say
no
way
ive
already
blown
about
hours
with
this
about
of
them
on
hold
and
i
dont
have
the
time
or
to
take
a
day
off
work
also
my
day
return
period
is
almost
over
and
ive
only
been
able
to
use
the
thin
for
about
minutes
so
the
whole
thing
is
going
back
i
was
extremely
upset
when
i
began
this
post
because
the
support
rep
told
me
that
i
would
have
to
pay
shipping
not
only
for
the
returned
system
but
also
the
two
hard
drive
controllers
they
had
sent
me
fortunately
i
just
spoke
to
customer
service
and
they
are
going
to
have
ups
come
and
pick
everything
up
gratis
the
only
downside
is
that
now
i
have
to
order
another
computer
i
would
really
like
to
try
gateway
again
im
just
very
turned
off
by
the
prospect
of
having
to
try
and
get
through
to
customer
service
or
tech
support
again
i
think
their
products
are
great
for
the
most
part
but
im
beginning
to
wonder
if
the
savings
are
worth
the
potential
aggravation
are
other
mail
order
companies
as
difficult
to
contact
i
know
gateway
is
booming
and
for
good
reason
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
take
it
again
oh
well
i
feel
better
now
mark
devaney
hear
me
now
and
believe
me
later
