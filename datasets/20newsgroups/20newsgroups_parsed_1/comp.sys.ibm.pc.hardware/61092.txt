ive
been
looking
a
a
philips
dt
which
uses
a
sony
trinitron
tube
has
digital
controls
supports
up
to
xni
and
has
mm
dot
pitch
it
can
be
found
for
under
the
original
poster
john
navitsky
said
that
he
might
use
the
monitor
on
a
sparcstation
lx
the
lx
is
able
to
generate
a
picture
at
at
hz
not
officially
but
i
tried
to
set
this
resolution
and
refresh
rate
and
the
lx
came
up
with
a
nonsyncing
screen
our
tube
obviously
couldnt
handle
this
speed
at
hz
it
worked
perfectly
i
dont
know
which
tube
the
viewsonic
uses
but
it
has
an
khz
horizontal
bandwidth
so
you
can
go
pretty
high
i
ran
mine
at
xx
which
was
as
fast
as
the
orchid
p
could
drive
it
also
the
does
claim
to
be
able
to
support
x
but
i
have
no
experience
with
that
since
i
have
the
spec

i
dont
know
what
some
of
those
mean
and
dont
verify
their
accuracy
i
just
typed
them
in
other
things
they
hype
on
the
sheet
are
a
double

right
they
mean
they
use

advanced

viewmatch
color
control
which
they
claim
is
and
easytouse
system
that
adjusts
colors
to
closely
match
printer
output
as
near
as
i
have
been
able
to
figure
out
this
translates
to
separate
controls
for
red
green
and
blue
how
this
makes
it
easy
to
match
for
printer
output
is
beyond
me
but
beyond
the
hype
the
monitor
is
very
pleasant
to
look
at
sharp
clear
and
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
the
necs
for
reflections
