ram
boards
on
a
hello
i
have
a
sx
isa
machine
with
pheonix
bios
currently
i
have
megabytes
of
ram
installed
via
eight
mg
simms
on
the
motherboard
ie
both
banks
are
full
and
there
is
no
space
for
more
simms
i
am
thinking
of
running
os
on
my
machine
and
possibly
linux
with
x
windows
and
i
know
that
more
ram
would
be
helpful
however
with
simms
the
only
solution
i
can
see
is
to
sell
my
megs
for
about
and
by
mg
simms
for
about
used
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
cant
afford
the
price
right
now
the
entire
process
of
selling
ram
and
buying
it
used
probably
means
that
the
machine
might
be
down
for
a
number
of
days
which
i
would
rather
avoid
so
my
question
is
do
the
at
ram
boards
that
plug
into
a
free
slot
work
well
with
a
isa
machine
i
have
seen
some
being
sold
used
for
about
with
mg
with
space
for
another
mgs
if
these
boards
do
work
how
do
they
do
it
is
a
device
driver
needed
or
will
the
bios
pickup
the
extra
ram
as
it
does
with
the
simms
on
the
mother
board
i
know
that
the
isa
expansions
slots
are
bits
and
simm
memory
is
bits
so
probably
all
of
this
is
just
wishful
thinking
however
any
help
is
truly
appreciated
eric
