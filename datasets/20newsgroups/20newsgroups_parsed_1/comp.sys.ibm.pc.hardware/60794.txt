from
aldy
hernandez
i
suspect
the
external
cache
but
i
have
no
real
evidence
for
this
suggestions
about
the
cause
of
the
problem
bad
memory
bad
motherboard
bad
cache
suggestions
about
how
to
debug
the
problem
turn
off
cache
gcc
and
other
big
programs
seemed
to
crash
about
of
the
time
for
me
gcc
gave
something
like
program
as
got
fatal
signal
and
when
doing
anything
past
the
complexity
of
elvis
kermit
etc
i
got
kernel
general
protection
faults
at
least
once
a
session
i
disabled
my
cache
as
suggested
and
bingo
linux
is
as
stable
as
a
rock
it
hasnt
given
me
a
core
dump
or
kernel
error
yet
does
any
one
know
why
the
cache
would
do
something
like
this
aldy
if
programmers
are
paid
by
the
hour
how
do
you
suppose
the
array
x
is
initialized
more
programming
pearls
