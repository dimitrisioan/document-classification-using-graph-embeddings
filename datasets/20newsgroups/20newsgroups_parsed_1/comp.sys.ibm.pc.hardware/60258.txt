i
have
a
logitech
sf
or
fs
button
mouse
that
i
want
to
interface
to
a
serial
port
of
a
different
nonibmcompatible
system
the
mouse
is
xtatps
compatible
with
a
db
connector
i
tried
to
reverse
engineer
the
mouse
but
it
has
a
microcontroller
inside
it
if
i
could
get
the
db
pinout
and
perhaps
a
copy
of
the
bios
routines
that
support
it
i
could
map
all
this
into
my
target
system
anyone
know
where
i
might
get
the
pinout
or
the
bios
routines
are
the
routines
published
someplace
convenient
thanks
