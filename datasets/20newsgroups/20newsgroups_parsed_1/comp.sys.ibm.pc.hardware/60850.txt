hi
i
need
some
advice
opinions
regarding
which
pc
would
best
suit
my
needs
i
want
to
use
this
proposed
beast
for
basically
four
things
editing
documents
using
wordperfect
under
dos
creating
graphsanalyzing
data
using
sigmaplot
v
under
dos
editingplaying
with
images
using
aldus
photostyler
running
under
windows
these
images
can
be
large
say
k
x
k
bitspixel
using
the
pc
as
an
xterminal
running
desqviewx
and
sun
pcnfs
talking
to
our
network
of
sparcstations
this
is
where
a
lot
of
the
imagesdata
come
from
and
is
the
most
demanding
of
these
tasks
ive
read
read
read
pc
magazines
performed
benchmarks
read
this
newsgroup
and
decided
that
a
nice
system
priceperformance
would
be
dx
k

isa
vlb

ati

local

etherlink
iii
bit
maxtor
mb
ide
hard
drive
however
the
parts
dont
fit
our
local
retailer
apparently
put
one
of
these
together
only
to
discover
that
the
ati
card
wouldnt
run
at
mhz
surprise
surprise
actually
after
reading
this
group
im
surprised
that
they
even
have
a
mhz
local
bus
running
i
have
a
choice
now
between
basically
the
above
system
but
with
a
dx
with
isa
and
vlb
or
a
dx
with
eisa
and
no
vlb
and
thus
the
nonlocal
bus
version
of
the
ati
card
which
is
better
keeping
in
mind
that
im
primarily
interested
in
the
last
two
tasks
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
i
need
to
decide
quickly
so
any
speedy
help
would
be
appreciated
even
more
btw
we
have
a
system
now
to
perform
these
tasks
it
has
the
following
configuration
dx

cache
isa
meg

ati

smc
ethercard
bit
maxtor
mb
ide
hard
drive
were
quite
happy
with
the
ati
card
very
fast
once
the
data
gets
to
it
slow
repainting
images
under
photostyler
that
have
moved
off
screen
or
been
uncovered
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
enough
raw
cpu
when
running
desqviewx
its
sluggish
running
the
local
window
manager
also
many
functions
under
photostyler
take
a
long
time
even
when
the
images
fit
entirely
in
ram
theres
not
enough
memory
in
the
system
desqviewx
and
a
meg
smartdrive
dont
leave
much
room
for
other
apps
photostyler
will
page
to
disk
with
medium
size
images
i
have
performed
a
number
of
benchmarks
on
the
ethernet
transfer
rates
this
machine
sustains
only
ksec
over
ethernet
while
our
sparcs
sustain
ksec
on
the
same
network
going
to
the
bit
version
of
the
smc
card
increases
transfer
rates
to
ksec
still
very
slow
especially
when
moving
large
images
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
localbus
ethernet
card
coming
will
it
make
a
difference
im
hoping
so
and
leaning
towards
the
dx
choice
above
for
that
reason
also
are
there
dxs
on
the
horizon
what
about
dxs
dxs
any
information
is
greatly
appreciated
