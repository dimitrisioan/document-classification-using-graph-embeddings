hi
i
am
trying
to
set
up
a
conner
and
a
quantum
at
drive
i
have
the
conner
set
to
the
master
and
the
quantum
set
to
the
slave
doesnt
work
the
other
way
around
i
am
able
to
access
both
drives
if
i
boot
from
a
floppy
but
the
drives
will
not
boot
themselves
i
am
running
msdos
and
have
the
conner
partitioned
as
primary
dos
and
is
formatted
with
system
files
i
have
tried
all
different
types
of
setups
and
even
changed
ide
controller
cards
if
i
boot
from
a
floppy
everything
works
great
except
the
booting
part
the
system
doesnt
report
an
error
message
or
anything
just
hangs
there
does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
or
has
somebody
else
run
into
a
similar
problem
i
was
thinking
that
i
might
have
to
update
the
bios
on
one
of
the
drives
is
this
possible
any
suggestionsanswers
would
be
greatly
appreciated
please
reply
to

make
sure
that
the
hard
disk
you
want
to
boot
from
is
set
as
active
using
the
fdisk
program
that
comes
with
dos
mark
