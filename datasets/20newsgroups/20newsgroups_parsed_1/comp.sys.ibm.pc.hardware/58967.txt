re
gateway
dx
too
noisy
in
article
says
i
just
received
my
gateway
dx
minidesktop
system
the
first
thing
i
noticed
when
i
plugged
in
the
power
cord
is
the
noise
that
comes
from
the
fan
in
fact
i
can
hear
the
noise
in
if
your
gateway
is
equipped
with
a
western
hard
drive
then
the
noise
is
probably
coming
from
there
and
not
from
the
fan
the
western
drives
are
notoriously
noisy
on
the
other
hand
if
you
dont
have
a
western
drive
then
maybe
it
is
the
fan
theres
not
alot
to
do
about
it
except
insulate
around
the
cpu
somehow
