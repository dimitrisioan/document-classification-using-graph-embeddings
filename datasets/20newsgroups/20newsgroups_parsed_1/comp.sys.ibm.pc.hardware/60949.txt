a
sx
computer
with
a
mg
seagate
ide
drive
and
a
controler
built
into
the
motherboard
i
want
to
add
a
scsi
drive
a
quantum
prodrive
f
mg
formatted
i
have
no
documentation
at
all
and
i
need
your
help
as
i
understand
it
here
is
the
process
of
adding
such
a
drive
could
you
please
tell
me
if
im
right
buy
a
scsi
contoler
which
one
i
know
adaptec
is
good
but
they
are
kind
of
expensive
are
there
any
good
boards
in
the
region
i
want
it
to
be
compatible
with
os
and
unix
if
possible
also
i
have
seen
on
the
net
that
there
are
scsi
and
scsi
drives
is
this
true
does
the
adapter
need
to
be
the
same
as
the
drive
what
type
of
drive
is
the
quantum
i
have
tried
others
but
i
think
that
the
adaptec
is
best
value
for
money
connect
the
drive
to
the
adapter
via
a
scsi
cable
and
the
power
cable
do
i
have
to
worry
about
the
power
supply
i
think
i
have
watts
and
all
im
powering
are
two
floppies
and
the
seagate
drive
i
dont
think
you
can
mix
the
two
types
of
drive
unless
you
have
one
of
the
scsiide
cards
that
is
available
you
will
have
to
turn
your
ide
off
is
this
true
i
was
under
the
impression
that
people
on
the
net
had
both
scsi
and
ide
working
together
well
that
seems
to
be
all
is
there
anythiing
im
forgetting
any
help
is
really
appreciated
im
lost
