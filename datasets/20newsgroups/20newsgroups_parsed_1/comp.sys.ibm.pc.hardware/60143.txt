this
doesnt
answer
the
original
question
is
os
a
multiuser
os
and
no
mention
was
made
of
an
ether
card
either
but
from
a
diskdata
point
of
view
why
does
scsi
have
an
advantage
when
it
comes
to
multi
tasking
data
is
data
and
it
could
be
anywhere
on
the
drive
can
scsi
find
it
faster
can
it
get
it
off
the
drive
and
into
the
computer
faster
does
it
have
a
better
cache
system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing
a
data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
you
are
making
the
same
mistake
i
did
you
are
confusing
the
drive
interface
to
the
data
throughput
interface
again
from
my
mac
ibm
info
sheet
available
by
ftp
on
sumexaimstanfordedu
in
the
infomacreport
as
macibmcomparetxt
expansion
both
mac
ibm
scsi
only
external
device
expansion
interface
common
to
both
mac
and
ibm
allows
the
use
of
any
device
hard
drive
printer
scanner
nubus
card
expansion
mac
plus
only
some
monitors
and
cdrom
apple
developed
some
specifications
for
scsi
controlers
while
ibm
has
no
exact
controller
specifications
which
results
in
added
incompatibilities
on
ibm
machines
main
problem
there
are
a
lot
of
external
devices
which
are
internal
terminated
which
causes
problems
for
more
then
two
devises
off
the
scsi
port
a
scsi
chain
is
supposed
to
be
terminated
only
at
the
begining
and
at
the
end
any
other
set
up
causes
problems
for
either
mac
or
ibm
scsi
devices
per
scsi
controller

asynchronous

ave

transfer
base
bit
scsi
requires
a
scsi
controler
chip
and
can
provide
only
fast
scsi
not
wide
scsi
which
are
both
bit
interfaces
see
scsi
scsi
devices
per
scsi
controller
in
scsi
mode
scsi
is
fully
scsi
complient
and
tends
to
be
implimented
as
a
very
fast
scsi
since
it
needs
a
different
controller
interface
in
both
hardware
which
tends
to
be
very
expendsive
and
software
transfer
speeds
are

mbs

bitwide
and
fast
scsi
in
scsi
mode
is
limited
to
devices
and
reduced
bit
or
bit
fast
only
throughput
due
to
the
difference
between
scsi
and
wide
scsi
ports
ibm
hd
interfaces
limited
to
hard
drives
by
design
or
lack
of
development
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more
than
one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
mbs
max
so
at
its
lowest
setting
scsi
interface
in
asynchronous
scsi
mode
averages
the
through
put
maximum
of
ide
in
asynchronous
mode
in
full
scsi
mode
it
blows
poor
ide
out
the
window
down
the
street
and
into
the
garbage
can
the
problem
becomes
can
the
drive
mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rates
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
scsi
comes
from
not
the
interface
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisims
to
use
the
scsi
through
put
the
cost
of
scsi
interface
is
a
self
fulliling
prophisy
few
people
buy
scsi
because
it
is
so
expencive
for
the
pc
which
in
turn
convices
makes
that
mass
producing
scsi
which
would
reduce
its
cost
is
unwarented
and
so
scsi
is
expencive
that
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
of
scale
the
more
items
sold
the
less
each
item
has
to
bare
the
brunt
the
cost
of
manufacture
and
so
the
less
each
item
has
to
cost
scsi
allows
a
drive
mechanisims
through
put
to
be
limited
by
the
drive
while
ide
itself
limits
the
through
put
