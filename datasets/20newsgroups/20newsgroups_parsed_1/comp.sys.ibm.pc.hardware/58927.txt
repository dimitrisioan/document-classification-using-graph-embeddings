cards
on
a
card
motherboard
this
may
be
the
dumbest
question
of
the
year
but
is
there
a
way
to
piggyback
or
expand
a
slot
motherboard
all
bit
to
get
the
usual
my
case
has
slots
for
and
id
like
to
get
a
scanner
but
with
all
my
other
cards
im
already
maxd
out
im
hoping
that
a
simple
solution
exists
eg
an
adapter
that
turns
one
slot
into
three
i
dont
mind
if
it
turns
it
into
bit
slots
as
i
can
put
my
io
card
midi
card
and
soundblaster
card
there
my
other
cards
are
bit
idefloppy
svga
modem
if
there
is
such
an
expander
does
that
screw
up
performance
of
everything
else
id
hate
to
buy
a
new
motherboard
