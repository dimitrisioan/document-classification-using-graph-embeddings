problem
i
am
trying
to
get
my
system
to
work
with
a
tandberg
future
domain
tmc
seagate
stm
mfm
controller
the
system
boots
up
if
the
tandberg
is
disconnected
from
the
system
and
of
course
no
scsi
devices
found
i
have
no
other
scsi
devices
the
system
boots
up
if
the
seagate
mfm
controller
is
removed
from
the
system
the
future
domain
card
reports
finding
the
tandberg
on
the
scsi
bus
the
system
then
of
course
stops
booting
because
my
mfm
hard
disks
cant
be
found
the
system
hangs
if
all
three
tandberg
future
domain
tmc
seagate
mfm
controller
are
in
the
system
looks
like
there
is
some
conflict
between
the
seagate
and
future
domain
card
but
the
funny
thing
is
that
it
only
hangs
if
the
tandberg
is
connected
i
have
checked
that
there
are
no
conflict
in
bios
addresses
irq
io
port
have
i
missed
anything
i
am
lost
here
any
suggestions
are
most
welcomed
thanks
in
advance
