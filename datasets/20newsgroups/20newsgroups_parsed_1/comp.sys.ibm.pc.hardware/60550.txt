thank
you

helping
marc

last
i

having
some
problems
in
his
immediate
family
and
had
delayed
the
continuation
of
development
for
a
time
this
was
some
months
ago
its
a
shame
the
driver
is
the
best
memory
manager
i
have
found
anywhere

doesnt
require
v
mode
like
qemm
so
it
works
with
ultima
it
doesnt
take
any
memory
runs
then
exits
if
only
the
emm
provider
were
a
little
faster
and
more
stable
