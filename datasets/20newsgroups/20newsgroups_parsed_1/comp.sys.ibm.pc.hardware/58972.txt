most

all
credit

companies
offer
to
double
the
warranty
up
to
one
year
namely
if
you
make
a
purchase
by
a
credit
card
you
get
additional
warranty
up
to
one
year
does
it
apply
to
the
purchase
of
computers
i
wonder
if
anyone
out
there
has
used
it
is
there
any
catch
thanks
in
advance
i
am
just
about
to
post
the
results
of
my
big
computer
purchase
one
of
the
key
points
was
the
ability
to
use
my
american
express
card
i
read
the
fine
print
between
double
warranty
policies
of
amex
and
citibank
visa
sure
both
will
allow
you
double
warranty
on
computers
but
citibank
has
a
maximum
claim
of
could
you
imagine
trying
to
get
your
monitor
or
mother
board
fixed
for
amex
has
no
limit
on
claims
remember
if
you
use
amex
you
must
either
send
a
copy
of
the
warranty
info
to
them
in
days
from
purchase
or
you
must
call
them
to
preregister
and
then
send
them
the
paperwork
within
days
of
purchase
my
preregister
pak
arrived
today
citibank
visa
requires
no
preregistration
ken
i
just
talked
to
a
rep
for
my
att
mastercard
regarding
this
there
is
no
maximum
claim
and
you
only
have
to
notify
them
of
the
warranty
when
the
item
needs
repair
if
it
cant
be
repaired
you
get
the
amount
you
paid
for
it
curiously
though
the
att
gold
mastercard
has
a
limit
of
on
claims
definitely
not
upgrading
to
that
card
