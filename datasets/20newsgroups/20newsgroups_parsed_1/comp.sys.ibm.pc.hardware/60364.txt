s
based
video
card
to
my

does
anyone
know
of
a
company
that
sells
a
card
that
can
coexist
with
another
one
all
i
really
need
is
color
text
on
one
monitor
and
fast
color
graphics
on
the
other
probably
just
a
configurable
address
would
do
it
for
what
its
worth
i
havent
confirmed
it
a
diamond
techrep
told
me
that
all
sbased
video
cards
use
port
addresses
xe
and
xe
if
this
is
true
it
appears
that
you
can
not
use

in
your
system
