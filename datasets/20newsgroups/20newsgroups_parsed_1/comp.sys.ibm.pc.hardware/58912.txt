bus
mouse
irq
sound
card
no
idea
what
to
do
can
be
set
to
any
using
irq
for
bus
mouse
gobbled
up
too
many
cycles
and
caused
loss
of
communications
with
floppy
disks
and
a
few
other
problems
i
could
i
suppose
switch
the
com
devices
externally
and
disable
the
second
port
on
the
super
io
card
but
i
really
want
to
have
them
both
available

the
sound
card
use
irq
without
horsing
up
the
works
all
replies
apppreciated
and
i
only
just
subscribed
to
this
newsgroup
i
assume
there
is
an
faq
somewhere
rather

sure
someone
will
tell
me
about
it
thanks
