i
accidentally
tried
to
low
level
format
my
western
digital
caviar
drive
is
there
a
public
domain
or
shareware
utility
available
that
will
allow
me
to
fix
it
thanks
i
am
no
expert
on
this
but
i
am
pretty
sure
there
is
no
way
to
recover
this
ide
drive
has
mapping
information
written
directly
on
drives
when
you
low
level
format
it
the
information
itself
is
gone
as
well
i
dont
think
you
can
get
it
back
unless
you
send
it
back
to
western
digital
and
ask
them
to
refurbish
it
for
you
jim
well
i
have
a
different
story
to
recount
i
attempted
to
lowlevel
format
a
wd
mb
disk
about
a
year
ago
when
i
understood
my
error
i
contacted
wd
they
told
me
that
i
hadnt
hurt
the
drive
and
that
i
should
just
run
fdisk
and
formats
on
it
it
was
fine
also
i
understand
that
western
digitals
bbs
may
have
some
lowlevel
formatting
routines
specifically
available
for
ide
drives
you
probably
need
to
talk
to
them
and
get
the
straight
scoop
