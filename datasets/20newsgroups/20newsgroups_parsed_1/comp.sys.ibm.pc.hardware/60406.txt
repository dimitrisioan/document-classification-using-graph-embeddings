hi
is
it
possible
to
use
an
esdicontroller
with
hdd
together
with
an
ideharddisk
controller
in
one
isasystem
ive
read
stuff
about
secondary
controllers
does
this
trick
work
thanx
in
advance
guido
i
have
the
same
question
as
guido
it
is
possible
to
use
the
esdi
drive
as
a
master
and
the
ide
drive
as
the
slave
i
can
definitily
say
that
you
can
use
an
rll
as
master
and
ide
as
slave
as
i
have
just
upgraded
my
machine
with
a
mb
ide
and
custom
controller
mdl
ci
extended
ide
controller
while
maintaining
my
rlld
wren
as
master
drive
the
trick
is
the
controller
which
supports
up
to
ide
drives
while
coexisting
with
existing
controllers
mfmrllesdiscsi
so
according
to
the
documentation
it
should
work
with
esdi
and
i
can
assure
you
it
works
with
rll
