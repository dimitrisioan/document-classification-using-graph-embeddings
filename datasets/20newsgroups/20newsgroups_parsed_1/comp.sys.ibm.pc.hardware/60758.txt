collected

and
published
regularly
on
compsysibmpchardware
there
is
explicitly
no
warranty
that
the
given
settings
are
correct
or
harmless
i
only
collect
i
do
not
check
for
myself
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
settings
may
destroy
your
hardware
since
i
hope
however
that
only
wellminded
people
undergo
the
effort
of
posting
their
settings
the
chance
of
applicability
exists
if
you
should
agree
or
disagree
with
some
setting
let
me
know
immediately
in
order
to
update
the
list
if
you
possess
a

of

you
know

please
mail
them
to

for
the

of

only
ide

the

if
not

there
are
bioses
that
dont
even
ask
for
it
another
statement
maybe
right
ide
harddisk
dont
have
precomp
and
lzone
the
precomp
is
a
builtin
parameter
and
lzone
isnt
used
because
most
if
not
every

has

the

names
are

often
only
a

a

both
with

however
when
doing

once

while
it
would
overwrite

using

was
almost
impossible
the
workaround
is
to

as

the

as

i
a

the

described
as
a
master
in
a
dual

environment
the
drives
are
described
as
a
master

a

this
is
due

the
protocal

there

four
links
lk

this
jumper
connects
the

drive
to

this
allows
a

the

an
external

the
