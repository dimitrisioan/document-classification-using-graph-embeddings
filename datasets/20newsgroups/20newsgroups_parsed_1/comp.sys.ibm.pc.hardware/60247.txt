although
there

this

scsi
can
be
wide
or
fast
it
depends
on
how
the
port
is
designedthe
quadras
will
support
fast
scsi
but
not
wide
when
the
os
scsi
manager
is
rewritten
since
the
quardas
use
a
scsi
nonwide
port
the
article
in
pc
mag
was
talking
about
scsi
scsi
uses
ten
devices
in

native
mode
outside
its
native
mode
it
behaves
a
lot
like
scsi
devices
slower
through
put
from
your
own
figures
scsi
is
indeed
twice
esdi
as
the
article
pointed
out
as
for
faster
then
ide
that
seems
to
be
bit
scsi
using
a
scsi
contoler
chip
the
mac
quadra
uses
a
scsi
controler
chip
for
its
scsi
and
gets
mbs
through
put
for
asynchronous
bit
scsi
far
in
excess
of
a
normal
synchronous
scsi
output
of
is
which
is
near
the
burst
of
a
scsi
machine
with
a
scsi
controller
chip
the
pc
world
seems
to
have
scsi
and
scsi
mixed
up
fact
is
scsi
controler
chips
allow
near
scsi
speeds
through
a
scsi
device
as
shown
in
the
mac
quadra
which
skews
some
of
the
data
of
scsi
vs
ide
or
esdi
test
i
agree
that
the
article
could
have
stated
that
the
faster
then
ide
came
off
a
scsi
device
with
a
scsi
chip
maybe
it
was
there
and
the
editor
killed
it
because
the
article
was
dealing
with
scsi
not
scsi
and
he
did
not
understand
the
effect
of
a
scsi
device
with
a
scsi
controller
chip
scsi
chips
are
limited
to
mb
max
scsi
devices
with
scsi
chips
becoming
common
produce
up
to
mbs
in
bit
mode
and
mbs
in
bit
mode
the
fast
version
scsi
ports
can
not
use
wide
scsi
of
cource
the
prime
piece
of
wierdness
is
that
scsi
devices
have
scsi
chips
or
more
accurately
the
machine
does
this
allows
the
best
of
both
worlds
high
scsi
speeds
and
cheeper
scsi
costs
full
scsi
hardware
port
electronic
controller
etc
is
very
expensive
it
also
creates
a
logistic
nightmare
as
to
how
fast
scsi
goes
when
one
knows
the
facts
behind
the
numbers
then
one
realizes
that
the
article
knows
what
it
is
talking
about
even
if
it
does
not
tell
how
the
figures
came
about
while
is
throwing
out
ranges
that
dont
tell
squat
since
he
ignores
scsi
devices
with
scsi
chips
his
ranges
tell
even
less
then
intended
