re
i
dont
understand
si
mgjoohwee
students
wrote
mg
i
went
buying
simms
recently
and
the
sales
person
told
me
that
the
mg
are
chip
simms
and
chip
simms
and
one
can
not
use
them
interchan
mg
if
you
use
one
you
have
to
use
all
of
the
same
type
dont
believe
everything
you
are
told
i
can
tell
you
that
mixing
them
between
banks
ok
and
i
cant
see
why
mixing
in
one
bank
is
not
unless
they
are
of
different
speeds
eg
mixing
of
ns
and
ns
simms
in
one
bank
the
two
only
differ
in
the
type
of
chips
it
uses
assuming
that
the
simms
are
mx
bit
wide
here
is
the
two
equivalent
configuration
the
chip
simm
uses
two
bit
wide
mbit
m
of
bit
nibbles
and
one
bit
wide
mbit
chip
for
a
total
of
bit
wide
mbyte
the
bit
simm
uses
nine
bit
wide
mbit
chips
these
are
equivalent
because
of
the
way
that
it
is
pinned
on
the
simm
board
at
the
simm
interface
they
both
act
as
bit
wide
mbyte
simms
sorry
if
too
techie
for
ya
mg
similarly
one
can
not
plug
in
two
mb
simms
and
one
mb
simms
to
gi
mg
the
system
a
total
of
meg
why
is
that
so
if
my
system
supports
mg
of
meg
it
has
simm
slots
can
i
plug
in
mb
simms
to
give
my
mg
mb
that
sounds
correct
the
problem
is
that
if
your
computer
takes
bit
wide
simms
you
can
not
mix
different
sizes
in
one
bank
why
you
ask
simple
if
you
understand
why
there
is
banks
assuming
you
have
a
bit
cpu
dx
or
the
data
bus
eg
the
mechanism
to
retrieve
data
from
memory
is
bits
wide
so
the
computer
expects
to
see
bits
when
it
asks
for
data
to
get
that
bandwidth
bit
wide
the
motherboard
links
mx
one
bit
is
not
data
but
parity
so
i
will
ignore
that
in
this
simple
explaination
to
get
bits
bits
that
means
that
a
simm
in
a
bank
stores
only
of
the
bit
wide
data
if
you
have
a
bit
bus
two
mx
simms
are
linked
together
to
get
bit
wide
data
which
is
the
reason
why
banks
are
simms
wide
and
bit
banks
are
simms
wide
if
your
computer
required
mx
eg
bit
wide
data
with
parity
bits
used
in
some
pss
and
asts
you
could
upgrade
by
one
simm
at
a
time
hope
that
this
message
is
not
over
your
head
but
the
answer
to
your
question
was
not
simple
i
could
of
just
said
because
i
said
