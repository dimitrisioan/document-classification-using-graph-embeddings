ive
just
installed
a
new
colorado
jumbo
tape
backup
unit
from
gateway
and
i
have
a
couple
of
complaints
with
it
i
dont
know
how
common
or
serious
these
problems
may
be
i
would
appreciate
some
feedback
from
others
who
have
used
this
system
btw
this
is
on
a
dxv
tower
system
i
have
a
similar
configuration
colorado
mb
on
dx
tower
the
problems
are
o
firstly
gateway
shipped
me
only
mb
tapes
even
though
the
drive
is
a
mb
unit
when
i
called
to
complain
they
only
said
thats
all
we
carry
and
with
compression
you
can
fit
mb
on
one
tape
maybe
so
but
then
why
did
i
pay
extra
for
the
large
capacity
tape
drive
you
got
suckered
in
the
same
way
i
did
silly
me
believing
that
the
logo
on
the
front
meant
actual
carrying
capacity
the
people
who
do
this
sort
of
thing
for
a
living
call
it
marketing
lawyers
who
prosecute
it
call
it
fraud
perhaps
we
can
have
a
bunch
of
other
duped
buyers
march
on
their
corporate
headquarters
o
i
have
about
mb
of
data
on
my
c
drive
i
choose
the
spaceoptimizing
compression
scheme
and
started
a
full
backup
the
software
estimated
it
would
take
about
minutes
it
took
hours
does
this
sound
about
right
this
is
a
bit
long
my
system
takes
about
minutes
to
do
the
same
thing
usually
hours
particularly
if
the
tape
is
grinding
away
the
whole
time
means
that
your
block
size
for
the
write
is
too
small
is
there
any
way
to
change
the
block
size
or
write
buffer
size
so
its
bigger
o
during
the
backup
about
a
dozen
files
came
up
with
access
denied
errors
most
of
these
were
in
cwindowssystem
commdrv
keyboarddrv
shelldll
etc
but
also
cwindowsprogmanexe
and
a
couple
of
files
in
the
ctape
directory
anyone
else
had
this
happen
this
is
because
the
files
are
opened
by
dos
the
files
in
the
tape
directory
are
likely
the
executable
file
or
the
configuration
file
for
the
tape
system
i
would
recommend
running
the
backup
from
dos
so
it
will
make
a
complete
backup
of
the
tape
directory
thanks
for
any
and
all
feedback
on
this
system
id
also
appreciate
hearing
of
good
sources
for
blank
tape
cartridges
preferably
mb
size
the
mb
cartridges
wont
do
you
any
good
since
the
drive
wont
write
mb
of
physical
data
on
the
tape
thanks
