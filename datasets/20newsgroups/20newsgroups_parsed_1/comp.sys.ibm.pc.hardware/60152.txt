do
you
really
need
to
switch
to
a
dx
instead
of
a
dx
as
i
understand
it
dxs
can
have
local
bus
devices
on
the
motherboard
but
not
local
bus
slots
and
according
to
what
i
been
told
many
systems
go
beyond
the
vesa
local
bus
standard
in
order
to
provide
dx
systems
with
a
local
bus
slot
capability
i
have
definitly
seen
a
mother
board
with
local
bus
slots
which
claimed
to
be
able
to
support
any
cpu
including
the
dx
and
dx
can
someone
throw
some
more
informed
light
on
this
issue
you
will
need
to
check
with
peripheral
makers
to
see
if
their
boards
will
work
at
mhz
some
will
with
some
motherboards
