my

is

i
has
the
save
transfer
rate
of
mbs
regardless
of
the
variations
of
the
isa
bus
speed
i
tested
it
with
speed
between
mhz
and
mhz
not
any
difference
the
problem
is
not
the
interface
between
the
controller
and
the

i
have

generic

i

i
tried
swapping
my
local
bus
ide
controller
for
an
isa
ide
controller
and
my
transfer
rate
went
to
kbs
the
specs
for
this
drive
show
a
maximum
platter
to
controller
transfer
rate
of
mbs
i
dont
know
how
to
get
there
from
here
the
local
bus
interface
got
me
a
little
but
certainly
not
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
i
am
also
looking
for
a
way
to
what
is
the
deal
with
the
ide
transfer
rates
is
anybody
getting
throughput
anywhere
close
to
the
plattercontroller
rate
i
havent
seen
anything
even
close
to
the
mbsec
limit
of
the
ide
interface
these
drives
are
noninterleaved
arent
they
here
are

i
managed
to
get
hold
of
the
quantum

product
manual
and
it
goes
into
excrutiating
detail
describing
how
the
bits
get
from
the
platter
through
the
controller
and
out
the
ide
interface
nowhere
do
i
see
anything
like
after
the
bits
are
whipped
of
the
platter
at
high
speed
they
sit
around
in
a
buffer
to
thaw
before
they
are
sent
to
the
host
even
though
i
swear
thats
whats
happening
here
are
some
relevent
quotes
from
the
manual
data
is
transferred
from
the
disk
to
the
read
buffer
at
a
rate
of
mbs
maximum
mbs
minimum
my
calculations
show
kbsec
maximum
and
kbsec
minimum
disk
spins
at
rpm
with
sectors
per
track
on
the
outside
and
on
the
inside
single
burst
errors
of
up
to
bits
within
one
sector
can
be
corrected
onthefly
in
real
time
as
they
occur
allowing
a
high
degree
of
data
integrity
with
no
impact
to
the
drives
performance
i
take
this
to
mean
error
correction
isnt
the
bottleneck
for
pagemode
operations
the
datatransfer
rate
to
and
from
the
buffer
ram
is
up
to
mbs
this
high
transfer
rate
allows
the
at
interface
ic
to
communicate
over
the
at
bus
at
a
datatransfer
rate
of
mbs
while
the
dcs
simultaneously
controls
disktoram
transfers
so
the
thing
can
even
do
its
cache
prefetch
while
its
sending
the
requested
sector
it
has
kb
read
buffers
for
prefetching
i
guess
you
could
call
that
a
cache
so
when
i
do
a
sequential
read
on
the
outer
tracks
why
am
i
getting
a
measly
kbsec
when
i
should
be
getting
around
mbsec
any
of
you
harddisk
engineers
out
there
know
wondering
why
my
disks
are
so
slow
