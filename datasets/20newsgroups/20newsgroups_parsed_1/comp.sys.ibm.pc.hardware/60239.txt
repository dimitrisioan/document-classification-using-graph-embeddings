q
which
of
these
cdrom
players
would
you
choose
for
os
netters
i
need
a
cdrom
drive
as
my
order
was
cancelled
and
thought
why
not
ask
the
netcommunity
i
was
ordering
a
nec
cdr
but
saw
so
much
cheaper
ones
that
i
want
to
know
more
the
drive
will
be
used
to
install
software
and
if
available
for
listening
to
cds
perhaps
some
day
ill
want
to
use
it
to
read
the
other
cds
but
thats
not
really
relevant
at
the
moment
ive
been
offered
the
following
cdrom
players
for
the
prices
stated
they
all
claim
to
have
scsii
and
operate
under
os
the
drives
are
not
listed
in
the
cdromfaq
and
therefor
please
give
your
opinions
on
the
drives
ive
got
the
impression
that
theyre
not
all
scsi
actually
the
nec
was
listed
as
nonscsi
in
the
cdromfaq
and
as
a
compatible
scsi
product
in
the
osfaq
ive
calculated
the
prices
as
having
dutch
guilders
times
its
actually
about
times

toshiba
nec
cdr
who
