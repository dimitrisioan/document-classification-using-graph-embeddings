diamond
video
cards
stealth
viper
speedstar
etc
may
have
excellent
specifications
and
the
windows
drivers
that
come
with
them
might
make
windows
blindingly
fast
but
if
youre
considering
buying
a
system
with
a
view
to
using
it
to
run
unix
linux
bsd
etc
or
some
other
special
software
there
is
a
good
chance
that
it
will
not
work
with
the
diamond
cards
this
is
due
to
diamonds
propriety
attitude
to
its
hardware
its
impossible
to
get
free
information
from
them
about
their
chips
specifically
their
dotclocks
without
paying
and
signing
nondisclosure
agreements
this
made
it
impossible
for
the
free
software
foundation
to
provide
xwindows
compatibility
with
these
cards
as
diamond
didnt
want
to
divulge
programming
neccessities
as
far
as
i
know
only
diamond
has
this
propriety
on
its
info
mark
