i
read
about
the
development
of
eisa
some
time
ago
but
dismissed
it
in
light
of
the
intense
interest
in
vesa
and
pci
however
i
recently
was
disheartened
to
hear
that
isa
can
not
address
more
than
mb
of
ram
a
limit
that
too
many
of
us
will
hit
all
too
soon
i
recall
that
eisa
will
support
bit
transfer
among
other
enhancements
is
there
such
a
standard
being
developed
very
possibly
but
if
its
still
going
to
be
backwards
compatible
with
the
isa
bus
its
going
to
be
the
same
tripe
that
the
current
eisa
implementation
really
is
from
what
ive
seen
the
pci
bus
will
just
be
a
new
bit
mhz
intelligent
bus
ie
bus
controller
takes
care
of
interrupts
and
the
like
not
jumpers
hopefully
itll
get
somewhere
up
there
with
the
amiga
zorro
iii
bus
vl
bus
is
a
bit
too
much
of
a
hack
for
my
liking
