enough
to
do

it
werent
so
people
wouldnt
buy
pentiumtm
systems
in
the
first
place
since
they
could
buy
a
dx
that
would
run
their
existing
applications
faster
certainly
a
dx
is
in
the
same
league
as
a
pentiumtm
is
the
dx
anything
more
than
a
myth
i
havent
heard
of
it
from
any
source
that
i
trust
and
i
sure
dont
see
any
ads
for
dx
machines
in
computer
shopper
intel
is
pretty
busy
with
the
pentium
right
now
i
cant
seem
them
introducing
their
own
competition
ibm
has
displayed
a
dx
as
a
technology
demo
this
effectivly
means
heres
some
neat
technology
it
is
not
a
commitment
to
make
such
an
item
