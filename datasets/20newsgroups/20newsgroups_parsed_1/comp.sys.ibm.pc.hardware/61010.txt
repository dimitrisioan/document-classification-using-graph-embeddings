re
monitor
with
rgbsync
to
vga
yes
but
what
if
my
monitor
only
has
bncs
on
it
and
is
expecting
to
get
a
composite
sync
signal
on
the
green
there
ought
to
be
a
little
black
box
that
takes
the
vga
signalling
which
has
horiz
vert
and
composite
sync
on
different
pins
plus
the
r
g
and
b
pairs
and
merges
the
green
and
composite
sync
together
in
the
output
its
all
v
analog
as
far
as
i
know
i
can
build
this
with
opamps
but
i
dont
think
i
can
get
the
shielding
done
well
enough
to
handle
the
frequencies
involved
without
lots
of
shadows
and
junk
on
the
screen
does
anyone
know
of
a
vgargbcomposite
sync
on
