dont
buy
from
tc
computers
im
planning
to
buy
a
computer
and
i
like
tcs
ads
can
you
tell
anything
about
the
company
and
their
computers
also
if
anyone
has
a
company
they
would
prefer
please
let
me
know
yes
they
are
nice
ads
and
even
better
great
prices
but
this
is
all
on
the
outside
the
consumer
sees
this
and
orders
little
do
they
know
they
will
get
poor
service
very
poor
when
i
ordered
a
mb
hard
drive
from
tc
about
months
ago
i
received
it
in
the
mail
installed
it
and
discovered
it
didnt
work
i
sent
it
back
to
them
and
they
said
theyd
send
me
a
refund
check
it
took
many
many
many
phone
calls
and
hatemail
as
well
as
threats
of
lawsuit
to
get
back
my
in
fact
it
took
two
whole
months
of
calling
and
threatening
every
time
id
call
i
would
be
put
on
the
runaround
until
i
finally
wound
up
on
an
answering
machine
id
leave
my
name
and
phone
but
i
didnt
even
get
called
back
once
i
am
one
pissed
off
tc
customer
and
if
you
dont
want
to
get
ripped
off
or
if
you
want
decent
service
do
not
i
repeat
do
not
buy
from
this
company
the
money
saved
is
not
worth
the
ulcers
you
will
get
pass
this
word
around
to
your
friends
companies
like
this
do
not
deserve
to
stay
in
business
so
lets
not
give
them
out
hard
earned
money
discount
micro
systems
powerhouse
and
gateway
all
have
given
me
excellent
service
and
speed
in
the
past
i
highly
recommend
them
to
anyone
