re
booting
from
b
drive
hi
i
think
vgacopy
can
do
what
you
need
if
you
create
a
new
floppy
for
your
a
drive
that
is
the
turn
on
the
modify
switch
of
vgacopy
when
you
boot
using
this
diskette
a
message
appears
this
is
no
system
disk
you
can
replace
disk
with
another
boot
from
harddisk
or
switch
drives
and
reboot
that
is
a
becomes
b
b
becomes
a
type
your
choice
when
you
select
the
third
item
you
can
boot
from
b
which
is
now
called
a
seems
to
work
very
good
for
example
booting
drdos
from
the
installation
disks
in
format
was
no
problem
for
a
friend
of
mine
i
have
only
a
a
drive
hope
that
helps
robert
ps
vgacopy
is
shareware
so
its
easy
to
get
newest
version
seems
to
be
