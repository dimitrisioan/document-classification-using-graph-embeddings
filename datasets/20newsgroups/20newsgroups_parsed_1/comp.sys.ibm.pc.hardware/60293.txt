installing
second
ide
drive
recently
my
cousin
got
a
second
internal
ide
drive
a
seagate
mb
i
can
look
up
the
model
number
if
its
important
and
ive
been
trying
to
help
him
install
it
ive
got
a
vested
interest
since
my
machines
busted
and
i
have
to
use
his
until
i
get
mine
fixed
he
already
has
a
seagate
mb
ide
hd
again
i
forget
the
model
number
but
i
can
find
out
anyway
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
bloody
thing
up
ive
managed
to
get
one
or
the
other
drive
up
with
the
other
disconnected
but
not
both
at
the
same
time
whenever
i
try
the
thing
hangs
during
bootup
never
gets
past
the
system
test
the
ide
controllers
instruction
sheet
says
it
supports
two
drives
i
think
ive
configured
the
cmos
correctly
the
powers
plugged
in
properly
i
even
learned
about
the
masterslave
relationship
that
two
hds
are
supposed
to
have
didnt
know
pcs
were
into
sm
and
i
think
i
configured
the
jumpers
properly
the
mb
one
is
the
master
the
new
mb
one
is
the
slave
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
maybe
im
doing
the
cabling
wrong
ive
tried
several
combinations
controller
master
slave
controller
slave
master
master
controller
slave
none
of
them
worked
unfortunately
i
cant
think
of
any
others
another
possibility
is
that
the
mb
one
is
already
partitioned
into
two
seperate
drives
c
and
d
and
the
cmos
asks
for
c
drive
and
d
drive
setup
info
rather
than
drive
and
drive
like
most
others
ive
seen
could
this
be
confusing
things
so
i
need
help
the
drive
came
bereft
of
any
docs
except
for
some
info
for
the
cmos
setup
the
controller
has
a
little
piece
of
paper
about
the
size
of
an
index
card
i
cannibalized
the
cable
its
one
of
those
with
a
connector
at
each
end
and
the
one
in
the
middle
so
it
looks
like
a
serial
connection
now
i
be
lost
many
many
thanks
in
advance
this
is
practically
an
emergency
i
have
two
papers
to
do
on
this
thing
for
monday
