bios
timer
interrupts
hello
im
trying
to
use
the
bios
timer
interrupts
which
occur
every
seconds
or
times
a
second
to
time
peoples
response
times
in
a
psychology
experiment
and
the
response
times
are
on
the
order
of
seconds
is
there
any
way
i
can
get
better
precision
than
by
counting
ticks
or
can
i
make
the
ticks
occur
more
frequently
im
trying
to
do
this
in
dos
on
a
and
it
would
be
nice
if
this
could
also
work
on
our
old
machines
running
dos
i
know
i
know
i
dont
like
them
any
more
than
you
do
but
this
is
by
no
means
a
requirement
just
a
possibility
so
basically
any
information
on
the
bios
tick
scheme
and
the
related
inrterruots
would
be
appreciated
as
well
as
any
information
on
alternate
ways
of
improving
accuracy
email
is
preferred
as
im
planning
on
posting
this
to
a
few
boards
and
i
dont
read
all
of
them
thanks
joe
