subject
inth
for
joysticks
is
slow
im
using
inth
to
read
my
joystick
and
it
is
hideously
slow
something
like
of
my
cpu
time
is
being
spent
reading
the
joystick
and
this
is
in
a
program
that
does
nothing
but
printf
and
joyread
the
problem
is
that
a
lot
of
programs
trap
inth
like
smartdrv
and
so
it
is
a
slow
as
hell
interface
can
i
read
the
joystick
port
in
a
reasonably
safe
fashion
via
polling
and
that
isnt
platform
or
clockspeed
specific
thanks
