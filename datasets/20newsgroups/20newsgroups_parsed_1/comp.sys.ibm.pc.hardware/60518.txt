almost
got
a

laughing
at
this
one
youll
probably
get
one
when
you
realize
that
your
vesa
super
dooper
local
bus
ultra
high
tech
controller
sucks
if
anything
scsi
on
a
pc
will
be
obsolete
killed
off
by
vesa
local
with
any
luck
pc
bus
archeitecture
will
be
doen
any
with
by
sbus
have
you
ever
seen
what
happens
when
you
hook
a
busmaster
controller
to
a
vesa
local
bus
it
actually
slows
down
your
system
bus
ide
it
must
be
real
nice
to
get
shafted
by
bucks
for
the
extra
cost
of
a
scsi
drive
then
pay
another
for
a
scsi
controller
yeah
there
is
absolutely
no
use
for
vlb
except
for
video
graphics
and
no
ide
could
possibly
take
advantage
the
vlb
because
it
runs
at
mhz
and
bits
do
people
forget
that
the
ide
was
specifically
designed
to
interface
directly
with
the
at
isa
bus
weve
seen
ides
come
out
for
eisa
xt
isa
and
now
even
mca
but
at
all
times
it
was
a
bit
standard
running
at
somewhere
near
mhz
when
you
run
an
ide
off
of
the
vlb
theres
no
way
that
youre
running
it
at
mhz
it
would
burn
up
of
course
same
goes
for
scsi
esdi
whatever
none
of
them
run
at
cpu
speed
the
only
way
to
gain
advantage
with
a
vlb
ide
is
to
hook
it
up
to
a
caching
controller
i
suspect
it
would
be
much
much
better
to
get
a
software
disk
cache
instead
since
you
get
writecaching
as
well
because
you
have
an
ide
and
no
one
makes
ide
disks
that
big
ive
seen
some
fuji
ide
drives
going
as
high
