this
may
be
a
very
naive
question
but
is
there
any
basis
for
the
claim
that
a
cpu
will
get
hotter
when
a
computationally
intensive
job
is
running
my
friend
claims
that
there
will
be
little
difference
in
the
temperature
of
an
idle
cpu
and
a
cpu
running
a
computationally
intensive

i
totally
agree
with
your
friend
since
when
the
cpu
is
apparently
idle
it
is
still
in
fact
churning
away
millions
of
instructions
per
second
checking
for
keyboard
input
for
instance
the
exception
to
this
is
for
cpus
used
in
laptops
where
the
cpu
can
enter
an
idle
state
where
it
is
just
preserving
its
current
status
but
doing
absolutely
nothing
in
this
case
it
needs
a
hardware
interrupt
to
get
it
going
again
