this
may
be
a
very
naive
question
but
is
there
any
basis
for
the
claim
that
a
cpu
will
get
hotter
when
a
computationally
intensive
job
is
running
i
totally
agree
with
your
friend
since
when
the
cpu
is
apparently
idle
it
is
still
in
fact
churning
away
millions
of
instructions
per
second
checking
for
keyboard
input
for
instance
the
exception
to
this
is
for
cpus
used
in
laptops
where
the
cpu
can
enter
an
idle
state
where
it
is
just
preserving
its
current
status
but
doing
absolutely
nothing
in
this
case
it
needs
a
hardware
interrupt
to
get
it
going
again
actually
the
iapx
family
has
a
halt
instruction
that
causes
the
cpu
to
cease
processing
instructions
the
cpu
resumes
processing
either
by
being
reset
or
by
receiving
an
external
hardware
interrupt
this
is
different
from
the
power
management
facilities
victor
mentions
of
course
whether
an
operating
systems
idle
loop
uses
the
halt
instruction
is
another
matter
entirely
