have
a
choice
now
between
basically
the
above
system
but
with
a
dx
with
isa
and
vlb
or
a
dx
with
eisa
and
no
vlb
and
thus
the
nonlocal

version
of
the

which
is
better
keeping
in
mind
that
im
primarily
interested
in
the
last
two

the

of
pc

published
benchmarks
for
the

on
both
vlb

the
original

ross

was
primary
intersted
in
manipulating
large

moving
a
