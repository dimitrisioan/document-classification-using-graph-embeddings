wanted
floppy
controller
that
can
handle
multiple
floppies
i
need
to
duplicate
a
bunch
of
floppy
disks
and
ideally
would
like
to
be
able
to
keep
to
floppies
busy
simultaneously
on
a
single
pc
yes
i
know
that
services
to
do
this
exist
i
know
that
standard
isa
bus
floppy
controllers
can
only
have
one
drive
active
at
a
time
i
know
that
some
controllers
are
available
that
can
handle
floppies
with
serialized
access
i
know
that
microchannel
machines
can
keep
more
than
one
floppy
active
simultaneously
but
does
anyone
have
a
controller
for
an
isa
bus
pc
that
can
simultaneously
keep
to
floppies
going
how
about
for
an
eisa
machine
if
the
limitation
is
a
software
limitation
i
can
work
around
that
by
using
os
on
my
pc
new
or
used
im
interested
