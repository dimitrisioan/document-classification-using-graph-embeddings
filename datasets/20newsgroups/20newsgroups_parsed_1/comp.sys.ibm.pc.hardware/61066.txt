when
posting
winmark
results
it
is
a
good
idea
to
give
the
version
of
winbench
that
you
used
to
obtain
the
scores
as
well
as
the
resolution
that
you
tested
and
the
version
of
the
drivers
doesnt
anybody
actually
read
the
licence
agreement
of
winbench
before
blindly
running
it
the
licence
agreement
very
clearly
says
that
details
about
hardware
configuration
driver
resolution
and
other
relevant
facts
must
be
included
when
giving
winmark
results
ziffdavis
wants
everybody
to
do
this
and
that
requirement
makes
sense
really
plain
numbers
are
useless
when
resolution
driver
and
machine
are
unknown
