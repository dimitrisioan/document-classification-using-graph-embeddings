nec
fg
or
now
also
available
the
nec
fge
only
difference
no
accucolor
any
experiences
or
opinions
from
people
who
have
used
the
nec
fg
would
be
appreciated
since
i
want
to
get
one
right
after
my
exams
are
all
done
ie
about
a
week
from
now
i
have
a
fg
and
think
it
is
great
i
havent
seen
the
nanaos
so
i
cant
compare
but
the
fg
image
is
very
sharp
and
the
color
contrast
is
extremely
good
ive
used
other
trinitron
monitors
eg
a
sun
ss
color
monitors
which
is
a
trinitron
and
think
the
fg
is
at
least
as
good
perhaps
brighter
and
has
none
of
these
silly
horizontal
lines
running
across
btw
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
thought
that
the
fge
is
slower
as
well
as
missing
accucolor
it
may
not
be
able
to
handle
x
the
way
the
fg
can
