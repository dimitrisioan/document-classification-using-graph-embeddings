upgrade
sx
to
dx
im
thinking
of
splashing
out
on
a
new
motherboard
for
my
pc
i
am
running
linux
as
my
main
os
with
a
small
dos
partition
left
for
my
flatmates
games
my
current
setup
is
a
sx
amd
with
sx
itt
i
think
and
mbytes
of
ns
simms
and
mbyte
ide
basically
i
have
two
choices
get
a
dx
dx
or
get
some
sort
of
unfortunately
i
live
in
the
uk
where
computer
prices
are
far
too
high
the
first
option
works
out
at
about
pounds
mboards
start
at
this
price
for
a
sx
i
have
a
couple
of
questions
how
much
of
an
improvement
in
speed
should
i
notice
if
i
get
a
dxcopro
remember
im
using
a
bit
os
and
alot
of
floating
point
operations
how
much
faster
would
a
dx
be
than
the
dxcopro
should
i
get
an
upgradeable
mboard
with
a
dx
and
wait
for
amdpentium
price
pressure
to
reduce
the
costs
of
the
any
experiences
will
be
most
helpful
