comments
on
gateways
nomad
i
am
looking
at
getting
a
laptop
for
work
and
i
was
trying
to
decide
between
the
toshibas
and
gateways
nomad
the
price
is
about
the
same
but
the
gateway
has
significantly
better
performance
mb
vs
mb
hard
drive
mhz
dx
vs
mhz
sl
and
much
cheaper
accessories
extra
batteries
modem
the
concern
i
have
about
gateway
is
the
durability
and
reliability
does
anyone
out
there
have
any
experience
with
the
gateway
nomad
thanks
