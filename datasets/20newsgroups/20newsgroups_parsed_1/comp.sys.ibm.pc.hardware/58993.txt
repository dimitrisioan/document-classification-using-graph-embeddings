says
so
by
going
mailorder
through
gateway
i
save
plus
i
get
technical
support
over
the
phone
free
software
package
have
fun
trying
to
get
hold
of
technical
support
over
the
phone
at
least
locally
you
can
walk
right
up
to
the
dealer
and
tell
him
what
is
wrong
and
he
has
to
fix
it
how
long
does
he
have
to
take
in
fixing
it
does
he
have
to
use
new
parts
when
he
repairs
it
or
can
he
substitute
used
parts
without
your
knowledge
can
he
charge
you
for
repairs
that
should
be
under
warranty
but
he
claims
are
due
to
improper
maintenance
on
your
part
when
it
comes
to
local
dealers
have
fun
getting
consistently
good
support
most
of
their
techs
are
retreaded
salesmen
not
trained
technicians
with
a
high
turnover
rate
have
fun
getting
inwarranty
work
done
quickly
and
courteously
have
fun
getting
outofwarranty
work
done
cheaply
or
even
done
period
unless
you
are
on
a
paid
service
contract
having
been
both
a
service
technician
and
a
service
manager
at
a
computerland
franchise
and
another
retail
computer
place
i
know
what
im
talking
about
i
also
know
the
local
service
scam
that
retail
computer
dealers
like
to
push
when
theyre
selling
its
that
same
old
song
that
car
dealers
having
been
singing
for
years
buy
from
me
and
youll
get
good
service
we
always
treat
our
customers
right
buy
from
my
competition
and
youll
be
sorry
if
you
need
service
experienced
mail
order
buyers
know
that
there
are
some
mail
order
companies
that
give
excellent
service
including
overnight
replacement
parts
onsite
calls
etc
there
are
probably
some
local
dealers
that
can
give
you
good
service
too
but
if
you
think
all
local
dealers
give
consistenly
good
service
you
are
wrong
i
have
many
anectdotes
to
prove
my
point
but
im
sure
there
are
others
on
the
net
can
do
a
better
job
than
i
can
