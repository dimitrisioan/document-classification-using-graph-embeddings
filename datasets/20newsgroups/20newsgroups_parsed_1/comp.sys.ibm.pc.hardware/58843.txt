so
by
going
mailorder
through
gateway
i
save
plus
i
get
technical
support
over
the
phone
free
software
package
have
fun
trying
to
get
hold
of
technical
support
over
the
phone
at
least
locally
you
can
walk
right
up
to
the
dealer
and
tell
him
what
is
wrong
and
he
has
to
fix
it
phone
support
is
quick
and
competent
from
many
mail
order
firms
but
not
so
quick
and
not
so
competent
from
others
gateway
included
but
my
experience
with
computer
retailers
which
is
significant
has
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
sales
personnel
and
retailtechnical
personnel
are
forbidden
to
actually
learn
about
the
products
they
sell
talk
about
incompetent
ok
so
a
few
percent
of
their
answers
are
correct
but
those
salesmen
dont
even
realize
how
stupid
they
are
ok
ill
settle
down
now
let
me
catch
my
breath
fact
retail
stores
never
provide
a
better
value
in
terms
of
price
per
product
retail
outlets
are
desirable
however
to
those
people
who
arent
interested
in
learning
about
computers
enough
to
make
their
own
decisions
this
is
fine
for
example
most
of
my
education
about
carpeting
wall
paper
lawn
mowers
microwave
ovens
etc
has
come
from
sales
personnel
i
assume
i
must
be
an
idiot
but
i
dont
care
about
those
things
i
do
however
care
about
my
computer
ie
i
demand
features
and
performance
and
ill
be
damned
if
ill
pay
some
highschool
drop
out
commission
on
an
overrated
overpriced
system
and
in
the
process
be
subjected
to
his
distorted
bs
gl
are
generally
so
