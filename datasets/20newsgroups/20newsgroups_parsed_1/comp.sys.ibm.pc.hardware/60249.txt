grubb
says
in
pc
magazine
april
although
scsi
is
twice
as
fasst
as
esdi
faster
than
ide
and
support
up
to
devices
its
acceptance
has
long
been
stalled
by
incompatability
problems
and
installation
headaches
i
love
it
when
magazine
writers
make
stupid
statements
like
that
re
performance
where
do
they
get
those
numbers
ill
list
the
actual
performance
ranges
which
should
convince
anyone
that
such
a
statement
is
absurd
scsii
ranges
from
mbs
scsiii
ranges
from
mbs
ide
ranges
from
mbs
esdi
is
always
mbs
although
there
are
some
nonstandard
versions
all
this
shows
is
that
you
dont
know
much
about
scsi
scsi
with
a
scsi
controler
chip
range
is
indeed
mbs
and
that
is
all
you
have
right
about
scsi
scsi
with
a
scsi
controller
chip
mbs
with
mbs
burst
bit
note
the
increase
in
speed
the
mac
quadra
uses
this
version
of
scsi
so
it
does
exist
some
pc
use
this
set
up
too
scsi
bitscsi
mode
mbs
with
mbs
burst
scsi
bitwide
or
fast
mode
mbs
with
mbs
burst
scsi
bitwide
and
fast
mbs
with
mbs
burst
by
your
own
data
the
although
scsi
is
twice
as
fast
as
esdi
is
correct
with
a
scsi
controller
chip
scsi
can
reach
mbs
which
is
indeed
faster
than
ide
of
is
all
these
scsi
facts
have
been
posted
to
this
newsgroup
in
my
mac
ibm
info
sheet
available
by
ftp
on
sumexaimstanfordedu
in
the
infomacreport
as
macibmcompareversion
txt
it
should
be
but
may
still
be
there
part
of
this
problem
is
both
mac
and
ibm
pc
are
inconsiant
about
what
scsi
is
which
though
it
is
well
documented
that
the
quadra
has
a
scsi
chip
an
apple
salesperson
said
it
uses
a
fast
scsi
chip
not
at
a
mbs
mbs
burst
it
does
not
scsi
is
mbs
maximum
synchronous
and
quadra
uses
ansynchronous
scsi
which
is
slower
it
seems
that
mac
and
ibm
see
scsi
interface
and
think
scsi
when
it
maybe
a
scsi
interface
driven
in
the
machine
by
a
scsi
controller
chip
in
bit
mode
which
is
much
faster
then
true
scsi
can
go
dont
slam
an
article
because
you
dont
understand
what
is
going
on
one
reference
for
the
quadras
scsi
controller
chip
is
