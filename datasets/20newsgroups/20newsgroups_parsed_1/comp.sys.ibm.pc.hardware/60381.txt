i
just
bought
at
quantum
for
my
mac
at
home
i
paid
for
it
i
havent
seen
ide
drives
cheaper
a
friend
of
mine
just
got
a
maxtor
meg
ide
drive
for
thats
million
bytes
or
megabytes
with
the
basic
interface
he
gets
close
to
megsec
transfer
on
his
does
your
figure
include
a
few
hundred
for
scsi
drivers
since
the
mac
uses
only
scsi
for
hard
drives
yes
the
figure
includes
a
hundred
for
scsi
drivers
this
is
sloppy
people
and
dumb
but
on
that
point
is
it
faster
this
is
what
all
this
is
about
do
you
get
more
performance
for
the
money
ok
once
again
with
the
scsi
spec
list
scsi
with
a
scsi
controler
chip
synchronous
range
is
indeed
mbs
asynchronous
range
is
slower
at
mbs
scsi
with
a
scsi
controller
chip
mbs
with
mbs
burst
bit
note
the
increase
in
speed
the
mac
quadra
uses
this
version
of
scsi
so
it
does
exist
some
pcs
use
this
set
up
too
scsi
bitscsi
mode
mbs
with
mbs
burst
for
those
who
want
scsi
but
dont
want
to
pay
for
the
bit
or
bit
hardware
or
mess
with
the
scsi
software
controllers
usable
by
scsi
devices
with
close
to
bit
scsi
speeds
scsi
bitwide
or
fast
mode
mbs
with
mbs
burst
scsi
bitwide
and
fast
mbs
with
mbs
burst
on
the
other
interfaces
let
speak
ide
ranges
from
mbs
again
synchronous
and
asynchronous
modes
with
asynchronous
much
slower
range
mbs
esdi
is
always
mbs
although
there
are
some
nonstandard
versions
one
problem
is
the
inconsitant
use
of
the
term
scsi
in
articles
and
by
people
its
proper
meaning
is
the
set
of
scsi
interfaces
composed
of
scsi
and
scsi
look
at
the
inconsitant
use
of
scsi
in
the
below
quote
my
comments
in
pc
magazine
april
although
scsi
is
twice
as
fast
as
esdi
this
is
asynchronous
scsi
with
a
scsi
chip
faster
than
ide
this
is
both
asynchronous
scsi
with
a
scsi
chip
and
bit
scsi
to
read
consitantly
the
quote
should
read
asynchronous
scsi
with
a
scsi
chip
although
asynchronous
scsi
is
twice
as
fast
as
esdi
one
third
the
speed
of
ide
or
asynchronous
scsi
with
a
scsi
chip
or
bit
scsi
although
scsi
with
a
scsi
chip
and
bit
scsi
are
eight
times
as
fast
as
esdi
faster
than
ide
note
the
nonuse
of
scsi
by
itself
this
eliminates
ambaguity
scsi
drivers
are
somewhat
reasonable
while
bit
and
bit
scsi
drivers
are
very
expansive
bit
scsi
can
use
scsi
drivers
with
little
speed
degridationthe
mac
quadra
does
exactly
this
if
we
are
to
continue
this
thread
state
clearly
which
scsi
you
are
talking
about
scsi
or
scsi
or
scsi
over
all
scsi
and
scsi
it
does
make
a
difference
