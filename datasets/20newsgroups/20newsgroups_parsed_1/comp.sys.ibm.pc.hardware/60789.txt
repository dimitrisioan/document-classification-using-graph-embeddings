re
modems
and
noisy
lines
i
used
to
have
a
lot
of
line
noise
problems
with
my
baud
modem
what
was
sudgested
to
me
was
to
put
a
toriod
transformer
on
the
line
this
is
easily
done
by
getting
a
large
toroid
core
from
your
local
electronics
shop
a
toroid
core
is
a
ceramicmetal
donut
and
wind
the
telephone
line
in
through
the
center
of
the
core
and
out
around
the
outside
five
or
six
times
this
is
a
easy
and
cheap
fix
that
does
not
have
the
hassels
of
having
to
use
sofware
to
fix
a
hardware
problem
talk
