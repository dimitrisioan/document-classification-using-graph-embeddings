diamond
stealth
giving
winmarks
i
have
just
installed
a
diamond
stealth
isa
card
in
a
dx
system
with
k
cache
and
megs
of
memory
that
gets
about
a
si
cpu
benchmark
rating
using
the
xx
color
driver
under
windows
i
am
getting
a
winbench
winmarks
rating
of
only
about
million
since
i
have
heard
that
others
get
to
million
for
this
card
i
assume
that
something
is
very
wrong
with
my
setup
what
are
some
possible
causes
of
the
card
slowing
down
like
this
i
ran
the
qualitas
asq
diagnostic
program
on
memory
and
i
noted
the
following
memory
timings
on
my
machine

note
two
things
on
this
chart
the
video
memory
appears
to
be
many
orders
of
magnitude
slower
than
system
memory
are
there
wait
states
being
inserted
here
and
what
would
cause
that
the
ems
page
frame
seems
to
be
ridiculously
slow
even
though
it
is
being
mapped
to
the
fast
xms
memory
in
my
system
through
emm
whats
going
on
there
note
that
my
stealth
s
video
bios
at
ccff
is
being
shadowed
through
the
ami
bios
any
ideas
on
what
might
be
happening
