a
little
piece
of
paper
about
the
size
of
an
index

cannibalized
the
cable

one
of
those
with
a
connector
at

like
a
serial
connection

is
practically
an
emergency

dont

for

and
they
dont
speak
for
me
ive
been
told
by
our
local
computer
guru
that
you
cant
do
this
unless
you
perform
a
low
level
format
on
your
existing
hard
drive
and
set
your
system
up
for
two
hard
drives
from
the
beginning
i
took
him
at
his
word
and
i
have
not
tried
to
find
out
any
more
about
it
because
im
not
going
to
back
everything
up
just
to
add
another
hdd
if
anyone
knows
for
sure
what
the
scoop
is
i
would
like
to
know
also
thanks
in
advance
also
bill
willis
if
you
bought
your
ide
drive
from
a
dealer
you
shouldn
t
have
to
perform
a
low
level
format
even
if
the
st
hd
is
already
partitioned
into
c
and
d
fdisk
will
automatically
assign
the
nd
hd
to
d
and
change
the
nd
partition
of
st
drive
to
e
check
the
jumper
settings
and
cmos
setup
in
particular
the
correct
number
of
cylinders
and
tracks
