parity
error
system
halted
anyone
have
any
ideas
i
recently
bought
an
amd
the
motherboard
booklet
says
the
board
is
a
wbh
i
have
x
simms
on
board
the
machine
also
uses
a
super
ide
io
card
model
pt
of
course
niether
the
motherboard
or
the
io
card
booklet
clearly
state
who
the
manufacurers
are
im
also
using
a
trident
c
svga
card
anyway
thats
all
of
the
pertinent
info
i
can
think
of
my
problem
is
that
the
computer
often
freezes
or
displays
parity
error
system
halted
messages
depending
on
whether
i
set
the
memory
parity
error
checking
to
disabled
or
enabled
in
the
setup
of
the
bios
makes
sense
its
ami
bios
so
it
must
be
an
ami
board
i
just
took
it
back
to
the
dealer
and
they
replaced
all
of
the
simms
but
i
keep
getting
the
same
error
more
frequently
now
it
all
worked
at
the
dealer
and
didnt
start
screwing
up
till
i
got
home
figures
ive
tried
to
take
out
all
of
the
simms
and
even
reinserted
them
in
reverse
order
making
sure
that
the
connections
were
solid
my
suspicion
jumps
to
this
damn
all
in
one
hd
controllerserial
parallelgameport
io
card
or
to
the
motherboard
god
forbid
can
anyone
help
thanks
peace
