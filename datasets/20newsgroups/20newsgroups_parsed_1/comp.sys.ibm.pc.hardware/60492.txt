cant
imagine
why
someone
would
leave
their
computer
on
all
of
the
time
to
start
with
its
like
leaving
your
lights
tv
radio
and
everything
in
the
house
on
all
of
the
time
to
menuts
computers
are
a
special
case
and
its
a
pretty
good
idea
to
leave
them
on
cuz
everytime
you
turn
on
a
computer
youre
putting
a
surge
of
electricity
through
its
delicate
components
imagine
youre
turning
on
your
computer
or
more
times
a
day
youre
increasing
the
chances
of
damaging
the
chips
memory
etc
on
all
the
components
of
your
computer
so
you
may
save
a
few
cents
here
and
there
in
electricity
bills
but
it
wont
look
like
much
when
it
come
time
to
fix
your
computer
my
worth
n
ngo
