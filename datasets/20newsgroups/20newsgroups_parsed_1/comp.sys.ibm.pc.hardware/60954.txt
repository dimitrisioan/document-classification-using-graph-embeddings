trying
to
find
a
pc
email
network
i
am
desperately
trying
to
find
a
pc
based
email
wide
area
network
service
or
the
necessary
network
software
to
establish
one
myself
while
i
am
aware
there
are
various
bbss
and
other
similar
services
avalible
like
compuserve
canada
remote
systems
etc
i
require
fairly
specific
criteria
in
approximate
order
of
importance
they
are
the
mailfilesnews
are
readwritten
locally
and
batched
to
the
network
server
ie
no
continuous
online
connectionnote
all
users
are
remote
and
will
use
modems
over
conventional
phone
lines
simple
the
users
i
have
for
the
system
have
very
little
computer
knowledge
have
never
heard
of
unix
and
have
very
little
interest
in
learning
it
is
essential
that
the
client
software
is
completely
painfree
cheap
we
would
prefer
not
paying
high
connect
fees
to
an
established
commercial
network
just
so
we
can
send
large
files
between
members
of
the
group
hence
in
addition
i
would
like
the
network
server
to
be
something
small
simple
and
inexpensive
like
a
there
are
only
about
people
in
the
group
so
it
is
not
a
huge
network
the
capability
for
internet
access
for
newsmail
internet
style
ids
eg
if
anyone
knows
of
a
system
similar
to
what
i
am
describing
even
if
it
doesnt
sastisfy
all
my
criteria
and
i
dont
care
where
it
is
please
please
email
me
and
tell
me
about
it
we
are
not
adverse
to
making
alterations
to
an
existing
system
if
necessary
thanks
