get
disk
drives
m
hard

and
a
k
floppy
drive
my
questions
are
can
i
use
these
drives
as

d
e
on
my
sx
this
sx
currently
has
m
hard
drive
m
m
floppy
drives
if
i
can
what
sw
or
hw
do
i
need
i
would
doubt
that
you
would
be
able
to
use
the
hard
drive
xt
drives
usually
came
in
mfm
or
rll
flavors
i
bet
your
sx
has
ide
drives
the
two
are
not
compatible
on
the
same
controller
however
you
might
be
able
to
use
the
drive
with
its
controller
in
your
sx
you
should
be
able
to
plug
your
k
drive
into
your
existing
sx
controller
i
think
you
might
have
to
use
the
floppy
controller
that
was
used
in
the
xt
