hello
folks
i
have
an
archive
xl
internal
qic
tape
drive
which
is
pretty
comparable
to
the
colorado
jumbo
since
i
have
two
floppy
drives
in
my
system
im
using
a
small
card
not
accelerated
made
by
archive
to
attach
my
tape
drive
as
a
third
floppy
device
the
problem
although
the
dosbased
qicstream
software
works
just
fine
both
the
norton
and
central
point
backup
programs
for
windows
fail
unless
i
switch
the
machine
to
nonturbo
speed
im
using
a
dx
eisa
since
the
dos
software
works
it
cant
be
a
hardware
problem
can
it
has
anyone
seen
similar
problems
any
solutions
thanks
in
advance
yeah
sounds
typical
windows
makes
all
sorts
of
extra
demands
on
hardware
and
therefore
your
machine
cant
keep
up
with
things
ever
notice
how
when
acessing
the
floppies
in
windows
everything
else
slows
to
a
crawl
i
imagine
your
backup
and
evertyhing
else
that
is
running
fights
for
cpu
time
and
sometimes
the
backup
program
loses
be
glad
i
cant
even
run
in
medium
speed
with
cp
backup
on
my
machine
supposedly
because
i
have
a
scsi
machine
which
places
extra
demands
on
the
data
bus
don
