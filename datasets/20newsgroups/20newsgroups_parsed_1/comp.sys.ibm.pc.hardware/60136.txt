it
looks
like
everything
works
as
advertised
but
i
am
disappointed
with
the
speed
im
using
an
intel
internal
k
modem
in
the
pc
with
telebit
k
on
the
unix
end
which
are
currently
limited
to
kbits
by
the
unix
com
link
to
get
a
quantitative
comparison
i
did
cat
file
where
file
is
kbyte
uncompressed
ascii
text
and
it
took
seconds
to
scroll
through
an
x
window
over
the
modem
link
charssec
using
the
identical
hardware
and
procommfw
the
same
cat
file
takes
seconds
charssec
btw
i
use
ncd
pc
xview
on
my
pc
at
work
hp
every
day
for
the
same
unix
access
from
a
pc
over
a
lan
and
like
that
just
fine
the
same
cat
file
scrolls
by
in
seconds
on
the
lan
connection
i
just
tried
a
few
experiments
i
catd
a
byte
file
lines
under
various
scenarios

but
gave
up
after

using
pg
sec
could
have
been
a
little
faster
i
had
to
keep
hitting
the
space
bar
i
was
using
an
ati
wonder
xl
video
card
by
the
way
so
pcxview
for
dos
looks
pretty
good
and
the
linebyline
scrolling
in
os
desktop
looks
pathetic
although
fullpage
redraws
are
pretty
good
i
tried
it
under
pcxview
using
my
normal
xbold
or
x
font
and
with
a
very
small
font
and
there
was
no
difference
in
the
times
the
modem
receive
light
was
on
pretty
solidly
so
it
looks
like
the
bottleneck
was
the
baud
modem
not
the
screen
drawing
