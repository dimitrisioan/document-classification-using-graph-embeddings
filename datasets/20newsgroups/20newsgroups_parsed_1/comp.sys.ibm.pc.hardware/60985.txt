questions

pas
in

dxv
i
went
out

bought
the
pas
yesterday

installed
it
into
my
gateway
dxv
i
followed
the
instructions
and
set
the
sb
side
with
dma
and
irq
the
default
and
then
the
pas
side
with
dma
and
irq
my
question
is
how
should
i
configure
for
mpu
compatibility
the
manual
and
installation
program
recommended
irq
but
on
my
machine
it
is
configured
to
cascade
to
irq
so
can
i
still
use
irq
or
should
i
choose
a
different
one
right
now
i
have
the
mpu
emulation
mode
turned
off
actually
what
is
this
cascade
to
irq
business
