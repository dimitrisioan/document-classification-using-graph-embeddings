i
believe
that
any
vleisaisa
motherboard
that
uses
the
hint
chipset
is
limited
to
bit
eisa
dma
where
real
eisa
dma
is
bit
the
hint
eisa
dma
has
the
mb
ram
addressing
limitation
of
isa
for
this
reason
i
would
pass
i
own
one
of
these
hawk
vleisaisa
and
am
look
ing
to
replace
it
for
exactly
this
reason
please
doublecheck
me
on
this
in
other
words
call
the
motherboard
manufacturer
and
ask
them
if
the
motherboard
supports
true
bit
eisa
dma
other
than
this
limitation
the
motherboard
works
quite
well
i
am
using
mine
with
dos
windows
and
unix

also
with
adaptec

you
are
correct
the
motherboard
manufacturer
where
i
usually
buy
boards
says
that
they
will
have
this
problem
fixed
in
about
two
weeks
