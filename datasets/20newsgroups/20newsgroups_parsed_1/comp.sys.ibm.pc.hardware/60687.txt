while
playing
around
with
my
gateway
localbus
machine
last
night
it
became
apparent
that
windows
didnt
give
the
option
for
bit
access
for
virtual
memory
i
am
using
a
permanent
swap
file
and
the
disk
drive
is
on
the
local
bus
interface
is
this
expected
or
should
i
be
investigating
further
why
no
bit
option
appears
you
need
to
massage
few
switches
in
your
systemini
in
the
virtual
memory
section
flip
the
bitaccess
switch
on
and
the
associated
driver
wdctl
or
some
such
switch
on
this
will
enable
bit
access
but
be
sure
you
can
use
it
as
not
all
hard
drives
and
controllers
support
it
for
seriously
fast
disk
access
throw
out
windoze
install
os
i
did
this
weekend
os
is
incredible
finally
a
real
os
for
the
humble
pc
