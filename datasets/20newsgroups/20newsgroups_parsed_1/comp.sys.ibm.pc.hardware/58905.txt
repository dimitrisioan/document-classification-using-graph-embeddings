how
to
program
a
pc
keyboard
itself
hi
all
i
have
heard
that
somewhere
there
exist
programmable
keyboards
eg
one
can
program
displays
on
the
keys
to
show
some
specific
characters
etc
does
it
mean
that
there
is
some
way
of
transmitting
some
nontrivial
data
to
the
kb
as
opposed
to
standard
numlock
onoff
typeamatic
specs
from
inside
the
pc
software
i
have
not
found
any
corresponding
reference
in
the
specs
for
the
pckb
interface
anyone
have
any
ideas
except
that
they
may
encode
data
by
the
sequences
of
the
standard
commands
mentioned
above
which
wouldnt
look
too
neat
besides
what
would
one
do
from
an
xt
great
thanks
in
advance
andrew
