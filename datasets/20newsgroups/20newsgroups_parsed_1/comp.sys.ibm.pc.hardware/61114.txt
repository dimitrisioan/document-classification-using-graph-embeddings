answer
gateway
service
has
confirmed
my
suspicion
echoed
by
a
couple
of
people
who
responded
to
the
original
request
for
help
the
ati
vlb
video
board
uses
the
addresses
for
com
they
could
suggest
no
work
around
i
will
be
returning
the
df
io
card
they
supplied
for
com
even
though
it
could
not
possibly
work
for
credit
against
a
bus
mouse
this
will
free
up
the
com
port
i
need
too
bad
the
original
salesman
who
suggested
either
the
df
io
card
or
the
bus
mouse
would
solve
my
need
for
a
port
didnt
know
enough
about
the
hardware
otherwise
i
must
say
that
the
dx
system
has
worked
very
well
no
problems
with
any
other
hardware
or
software
