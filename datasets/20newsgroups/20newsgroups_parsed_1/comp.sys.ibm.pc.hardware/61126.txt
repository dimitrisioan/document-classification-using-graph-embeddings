has
anybody
every
come
across
a
problem
whereby
a
hard
disk
locks
up
ie
crashes
the
system
when
attempting
to
load
disk
caching
i
think
the
logic
board
may
have
been
buggered
but
the
drive
works
perfectly
without
a
disk
cache
i
tried
hyperdisk
and
various
versions
of
smartdrive
all
to
no
avail
any
advice
would
be
much
appreciated
i
need
a
cached
drive
but
i
need
the
extra
space
of
my
second
drive
just
as
much
thanks
cheers
