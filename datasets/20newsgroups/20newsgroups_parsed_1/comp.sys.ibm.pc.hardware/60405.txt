thanks
i
recently
bought
a
leading
edge
dx
mini
tower
case
and
everything
works
fine
leading
edge
seems
to
be
a
decent
brand
and
whatnot
i
would
tend
to
say
that
it
is
a
decent
deal
the
only
things
you
might
want
to
be
wary
about
is
that
my
le
computer
has
a
backplane
mounted
motherboard
ie
the
motherboard
itself
is
a
card
that
can
be
plugged
in
to
a
backplane
some
people
dont
like
these
configurations
the
second
thing
is
that
whoever
set
up
my
computer
at
the
factory
didnt
really
know
what
they
were
doing
the
installed
windows
video
driver
didnt
even
take
advantage
of
the
svga
cardmonitor
look
forward
to
configuring
the
system
optimally
yourself
anyone
have
a
coat
hanger
my
brain
itches
if
i
was
a
turnip
would
i
be
revered
and
charles
budensiek
worshipped
like
i
would
deserve
to
be
ph
ask
if
you
want
it
