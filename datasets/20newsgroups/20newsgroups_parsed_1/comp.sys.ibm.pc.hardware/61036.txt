a
problem

this
the
kxp
youre

about
or

there
a
kx
too
ill
assume

just
forgot
the
p
the
paper
out
light
refuses
to
go
out
this
light
is
also
the
power
light
on
not
blinking
just
means
that
the
power
is
turned
on
if
you
look
at
the
panel
it
should
read
power
paper
out
right
it
starts
to
blink
when
ever
i
turn
the
power
on
which
beeps
dont
know
why
it
would
do
this
unless
youre
out
of
paper
that
is
it
does
allow
be
to
go
on
line
with
green
light
lit
simultanously
the
red
paper
out
light
also
remains
lit
but
is
does
not
blink
when
you
power
up
the
printer
assuming

does
have
paper
the
red
power
light
which
when
flashing
doubles
as
paper
out
should
light
and
a
few
seconds
later
the
green
online
light
should
come
on
