can
anyone
explain
in
fairly
simple
terms
why
if
i
get
os
i
might
need
an
scsi
controler
rather
than
an
ide
will
performance
suffer
that
much
for
a
mb
or
so
drive
if
i
dont
have
a
tape
drive
or
cdrom
any
help
would
be
appreciated
so
when
youve
got
multitasking
you
want
to
increase
performance
by
increasing
the
amount
of
overlapping
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bus
mastering
either
of
these
make
it
possible
for
io
devices
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memory
without
interrupting
the
cpu
the
alternative
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
several
scsi
interface
cards
that
allow
dma
and
bus
mastering
how
do
you
do
busmastering
on
the
isa
bus
ide
however
is
defined
by
the
standard
at
interface
created
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no
dma
if
were
talking
isa
at
bus
here
then
you
can
only
have
dma
channel
active
at
any
one
time
presumably
transferring
data
from
a
single
device
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devices
on
a
scsi
bus
explain
how
all
of
those
devices
can
to
dma
transfers
through
a
single
scsi
card
to
the
isaat
bus
at
the
same
time
think
its
the
scsi
card
doing
the
dma
transfers
not
the
disks
the
scsi
card
can
do
dma
transfers
containing
data
from
any
of
the
scsi
devices
it
is
attached
when
it
wants
to
an
important
feature
of
scsi
is
the
ability
to
detach
a
device
this
frees
the
scsi
bus
for
other
devices
this
is
typically
used
in
a
multitasking
os
to
start
transfers
on
several
devices
while
each
device
is
seeking
the
data
the
bus
is
free
for
other
commands
and
data
transfers
when
the
devices
are
ready
to
transfer
the
data
they
can
aquire
the
bus
and
send
the
data
on
an
ide
bus
when
you
start
a
transfer
the
bus
is
busy
until
the
disk
has
seeked
the
data
and
transfered
it
this
is
typically
a
ms
second
lock
out
for
other
processes
wanting
the
bus
irrespective
of
transfer
time
also
im
still
trying
to
track
down
a
copy
of
ibms
at
reference
book
but
from
their
pc
technical
manual
page
the
fdd
adapter
is
buffered
on
the
io
bus
and
uses
the
system
board
direct
memory
access
dma
for
record
data
transfers
i
expect
to
see
something
similar
for
the
pcat
hdd
adapter
so
the
lowly
lowdensity
original
pc
fdd
card
used
dma
and
the
pcat
hdd
controller
doesnt
that
makes
real
sense
