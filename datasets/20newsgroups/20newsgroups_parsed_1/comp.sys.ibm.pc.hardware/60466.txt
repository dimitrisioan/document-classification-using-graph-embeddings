can
anyone
explain
in
fairly
simple
terms
why
if
i
get
os
i
might
need
an
scsi
controler
rather
than
an
ide
will
performance
suffer
that
much
for
a
mb
or
so
drive
if
i
dont
have
a
tape
drive
or
cdrom
any
help
would
be
appreciated
so
when
youve
got
multitasking
you
want
to
increase
performance
by
increasing
the
amount
of
overlapping
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bus
mastering
either
of
these
make
it
possible
for
io
devices
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memory
without
interrupting
the
cpu
the
alternative
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
several
scsi
interface
cards
that
allow
dma
and
bus
mastering
how
do
you
do
busmastering
on
the
isa
bus
ide
however
is
defined
by
the
standard
at
interface
created
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no
dma
if
were
talking
isa
at
bus
here
then
you
can
only
have
dma
channel
active
at
any
one
time
presumably
transferring
data
from
a
single
device
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devices
on
a
scsi
bus
explain
how
all
of
those
devices
can
to
dma
transfers
through
a
single
scsi
card
to
the
isaat
bus
at
the
same
time
also
im
still
trying
to
track
down
a
copy
of
ibms
at
reference
book
but
from
their
pc
technical
manual
page
the
fdd
adapter
is
buffered
on
the
io
bus
and
uses
the
system
board
direct
memory
access
dma
for
record
data
transfers
i
expect
to
see
something
similar
for
the
pcat
hdd
adapter
so
the
lowly
lowdensity
original
pc
fdd
card
used
dma
and
the
pcat
hdd
controller
doesnt
that
makes
real
sense
