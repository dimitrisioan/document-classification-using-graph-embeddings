info
on
io
port
h
requested
all
during
my
attempts
to
find
out
how
the
at
harddisk
controller
works
i
stumbled
across
io
port
h
the
normal
controller
ports
are
in
the
fhfh
range
so
what
does
this
port
do
the
only
information
i
have
upto
now
about
this
port
is
that
it
is
a
write
only
port
and
the
information
you
have
to
write
in
it
is
related
to
the
number
of
heads
on
the
disks
could
somebody
shed
some
light
on
this
and
give
me
the
missing
info
