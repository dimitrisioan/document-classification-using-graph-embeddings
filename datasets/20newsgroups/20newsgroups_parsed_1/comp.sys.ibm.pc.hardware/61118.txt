the
crystal
scan
inch
monitor
i
have
meg
of
loca
memory
on
the
ati
ultra
pro
w
the
mach
driver
the
newest
release
my
problem
is
in
windows
when
i
use
the
mode
i
get
shadows
down
the
sides
of
the
screens
and
very
blurry
type
in
the
corners
the
types
on
the
screen
are
all
out
of
focus
ive
gotten
replacement
video
cards
and
a
replacement
monitor
none
of
that
has
helped
though
could
someone
pleae
help
me
with
this
very
frustruating
problem
i
have
the
meg
card
with
the
crystal
scan
inch
also
i
see
very
faint
shadows
on
the
left
side
of
the
screen
only
in
x
mode
but
not
enough
to
really
bother
me
the
characters
on
the
screen
are
clear
until
i
turn
on
the
crystal
fonts
then
they
become
blurry
i
have
a
friend
who
has
meg
on
the
video
card
who
has
the
same
shadows
but
says
the
crystal
fonts
are
well
crystal
clear

are
both
using
build
of
the
mach
drivers

of
us
has
a
monitor
extension
cable
i
tried
the
build
driver
and
found
no
difference
