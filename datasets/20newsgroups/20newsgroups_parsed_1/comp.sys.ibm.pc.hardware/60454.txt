gateway
telepath
modem
getting
vbis
i
have
had
a
gateway
telepath
modem
for
about
a
month
or
so
now
actually
i
had
one
that
wouldnt
connect
to
anything
no
matter
what
software
i
used
so
i
got
a
new
one
sent
to
me
this
allows
me
to
connect
to
my
favorite
news
system
with
zero
problems
so
im
somewhat
happier
but
i
still
can
not
connect
to
my
favorite
dos
bbs
with
any
kind
of
reliability
i
have
success
about
calls
not
good
i
would
hope
that
the
fact
that
this
one
can
connect
to
at
least
one
of
my
fave
places
means
i
just
need
to
adjust
it
what
i
usually
get
is
a
fast
stream
of
garbage
in
the
modem
response
line
on
the
dial
window
sometimes
it
will
drop
to
full
screen
mode
first
then
i
get
about
screens
of
garbage
in
both
cases
the
modem
seems
to
time
out
before
connecting
and
drops
carrier
i
am
using
default
settings
atf
and
getting
this
problem
i
am
using
the
autoconfigure
settings
that
gateway
has
supplied
with
my
copy
of
qmodem
atwcdsw
and
getting
this
problem
they
have
refused
to
help
me
beyond
this
claiming
it
must
be
the
bbs
or
something
like
that
not
so
my
work
modem
connects
to
this
same
place
just
fine
using
factory
settings
a
microcom
anyone
have
any
ideas
next

waco
update

ohio
prison

bosnia

abortion
update
