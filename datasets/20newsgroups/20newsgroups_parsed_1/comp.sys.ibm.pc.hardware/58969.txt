heres
another
one
my
computer
arrived
with
the
following
statement
in
its
configsys
file
stacks
i
changed
it
to
stacks
and
saved
bytes
maybe
it
could
be
lowered
even
more
but
i
havent
tried
it
exactly
regardless
of
what
microsoft
says
i
have
set
stacks
on
every
single
computer
i
have
installed
windows
on
from
a
simple
sx
up
to
dx
with
eisa
motherboards
ndi
volante
tiga
adapters
intel
ethernet
express
cards
and
caching
scsi
controllers
from
dpt
and
dtc
not
a
problem
yet
and
the
extra
k
gained
means
a
lot
with
conventional
memory
gobbling
programs
like
orcad
and

remember
reading
somewhere

think
that
stack
is
needed

for
the
windows
setup
program
otherwise
use
stack
rich
hmmmmmmi
got
my
comp
with
windows
preinstalled
and
stacks
is
still
if
it
was
needed
only
for
setup
wouldnt
the
morons
take
it
off
also
i
dont
have
the
qemm
manual
as
verything
came
with
the
comp
but
not
