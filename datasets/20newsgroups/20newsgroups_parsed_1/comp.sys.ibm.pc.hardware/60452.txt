around
performance
windows
dos
cad
go
for
ati
graphics
ultra
pro
theyve
done
two
reviews
in
the
last
three
months
and
that
card
ranks
as
an
editors
choice
in
both
reviews
for
all
around
performance
it
seems
it
just
cant
be
beat
you
should
pick
up
this
issue
of
pcmag
april
and
check
it
out
for
yourself

the
recent
reviews
have
all
shown
that
the
p
cards
they
looked
at
are
significantly
slower
doing
vga
than
the
ati
card
about
the
speed
as
i
recall
the
big
question
for
me
is
the
orchid
v
card
each
of
the
p
cards
tested
so
far
has
had
the
w
to
do
vga
orchid
is
the
only
one
i
know
about
i
dont
know
about
ami
that
uses
the
w
for
vga
that
is
reportedly
faster
i
would
like
to
know
whether
the
orchid
card
can
do
vga
as
fast
as
the
ati
card
if
so
it
would
appear
to
be
a
formidable
competitor
advertised
prices
are
about
the
same
for
the
two
cards
someone
in
this
group
posted
a
little
while
back
that
they
were
getting
an
orchid
v
card
has
that
card
arrived
what
do
the
benchmarks
look
like
also
is
the
ami
pbased
card
real
what
does
it
use
for
vga
speed
