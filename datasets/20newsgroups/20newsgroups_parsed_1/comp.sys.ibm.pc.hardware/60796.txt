motherboard
advice
needed
hi
does
anyone
have
a
source
for
dx
motherboards
ive
been
calling
around
the
local
stores
and
everyone
appears
to
be
only
stocking
the
dx
or
sx
motherboards
how
difficult
is
it
to
modify
a
dx
motherboard
to
run
at
mhz
is
it
as
simple
as
replacing
the
system
clock
with
a
slower
part
thanks
peter
