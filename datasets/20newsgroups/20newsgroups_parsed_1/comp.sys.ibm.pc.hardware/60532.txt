i
also
reviewed
a
new
nanao
the
fiw
which
has
just
been
released
whats
the
difference
between
the
fi
and
the
new
fiw
im
about
to
buy
a
gateway
system
and
was
going
to
take
the
fi
upgrade

fiw
instead

silicon
graphics
inc
the
fiw
is
optimized
for
windows
it
powers
down
when
the
screen
blanker
appears
it
powers
down
with
you
turn
your
computer
off
and
it
meets
all
of
the
swedish
standards
its
also
protected
against
emi
from
adjacent
monitors
personally
i
think
the
fi
is
more
bang
for
the
buck
right
now
