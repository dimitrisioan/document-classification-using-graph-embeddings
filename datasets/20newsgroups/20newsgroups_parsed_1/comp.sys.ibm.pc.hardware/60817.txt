re
dos
i
have
a
dx
clone
with
a
dtc
esdi
controller
and
toshiba
mbyte
drive
since
installing
dos
when
i
tried
to
reinstall
software
from
or
disks
when
i
mount
the
secondthirdfourth
disks
dos
doesnt
recognize
that
i
have
changed
floppies
if
i
do
a
dir
i
see
the
contents
of
the
previous
diskette
the
only
way
to
get
dos
to
recognize
that
diskettes
have
changed
is
to
do
a
label
and
then
to
not
label
them
buying
dos
has
been
a
colossal
mistake
dos
was
stable
and
worked
well
with
my
equipment
i
have
superstor
pro
and
desqviewx
with
qemm
manifest
etc
so
there
arent
any
features
of
dos
that
i
am
using
i
guess
i
should
roll
back
to
dos
but
i
am
wary
of
what
will
happen
when
i
do
it
besides
like
a
fool
i
dont
have
a
dos
bootable
disk
anymore
ive
made
the
same
mistakes
i
caution
my
users
not
to
make
like
sheep
i
joined
the
crowd
flocking
to
dos
