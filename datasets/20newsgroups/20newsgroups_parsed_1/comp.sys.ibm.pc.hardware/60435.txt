writes
stuff
about
the
connection
between
ide
and
ida
deleated
mhz
clock
bit
width
mbsec
if
ide
speed
come
from
ida
where
does
the
mbs
sighted
for
ide
come
from
scsi
is
not
complex
it
is
just
the
way
the
industry
uses
and
talks
about
it
there
are
three
key
differences
in
scsi
the
controller
chip
the
port
and
the
software
that
is
it
let
us
look
as
scsi
in
from
this
stand
point
scsi
asynchronous
and
synchronous
modes
software
scsi
driver
only
asynchronous
is
slower
then
synchronous
mode
only
mbs
vs
mbs
synchronous
speeds
can
be
reached
by
most
scsi
divices
with
a
rewrite
of
the
software
driver
as
is
the
case
for
the
mac
quadra
scsi
bit
this
is
the
main
source
for
the
confusion
this
differs
from
scsi
only
in
the
controler
chip
in
most
machines
in
the
mac
and
some
pcs
this
is
called
fast
scsi
because
it
uses
scsi
ports
and
software
drivers
and
can
produce
scsi
speeds
through
scsi
inspite
of
this
even
in
the
slower
asynchronous
mode
average
speed
in
asynchronous
scsi
mode
mbs
with
mbssee
in
both
quadras
and
higher
end
pcs
synchronous
mode
just
allows
a
higher
burst
rate
mbs
scsi
bit
two
versionswidefast
wide
scsi
requires
two
things
over
bit
scsi
a
scsi
software
driver
and
a
wide
scsi
port
on
the
machine
and
the
external
device
fast
scsi
also
requires
two
things
over
bit
scsi
scsi
driver
software
and
that
the
recieving
devise
support
bit
fast
scsi
speed
of
both
is
the
same
mbs
with
mbs
burst
scsi
bit
also
know
as
wide
and
fast
scsi
over
bit
scsi
this
requires
scsi
driver
software
wide
scsi
port
and
that
the
recieving
devices
also
have
a
bit
mode
scsi
chip
as
expected
this
is
very
expencive
speed
mbs
with
mbs
bursts
as
i
said
simple
seven
versions
of
scsi
seperated
by
software
the
controler
chip
and
the
port
standarize
the
software
and
it
drops
to
only
five
versions
of
scsi
seperate
by
only
hardware
the
chip
and
the
port
