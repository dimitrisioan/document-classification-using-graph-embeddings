heres
another
one
my
computer
arrived
with
the
following
statement
in
its
configsys
file
stacks
i
changed
it
to
stacks
and
saved
bytes
maybe
it
could
be
lowered
even
more
but
i
havent
tried
it
exactly
regardless
of
what
microsoft
says
i
have
set
stacks
on
every
single
computer
i
have
installed
windows
on
from
a
simple
sx
up
to
dx
with
eisa
motherboards
ndi
volante
tiga
adapters
intel
ethernet
express
cards
and
caching
scsi
controllers
from
dpt
and
dtc
not
a
problem
yet
and
the
extra
k
gained
means
a
lot
with
conventional
memory
gobbling
programs
like
orcad
and
tango

i
remember
reading
somewhere
qemm
manual
i
think
that
stack
is
needed
only
for
the
windows
setup
program
otherwise
use
stack
rich
