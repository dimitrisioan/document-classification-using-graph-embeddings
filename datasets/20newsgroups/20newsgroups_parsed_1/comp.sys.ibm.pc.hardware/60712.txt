hi
i
recently
purchased
the
toshiba
cdrom
i
own
an
adaptec
b
scsi
card
and
i
have
so
far
failed
to
get
the
cdrom
to
work
under
dos
it
works
very
well
under
os
so
i
know
that
the
drive
is
not
faulty
in
my
configsys
i
have
aspidossys
aspidisksys
aspicdsys
in
my
autoexecbat
i
have
mscdex
which
came
with
dos
mscdex
seems
to
find
and
install
the
drive
as
drive
f
but
when
i
switch
to
that
drive
and
try
a
dir
i
get
an
error
message
telling
me
the
drive
is
not
ready
or
something
like
that
the
cdrom
is
locked
too
and
the
adaptec
utilities
dont
seem
to
recognize
that
i
have
a
cdrom
at
that
point
has
anyone
ever
had
this
problem
is
there
something
abvious
that
i
am
missing
and
finally
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
using
this
setup
could
kindly
post
hisher
configsys
and
autoexecbat
hi
one
of
the
aspidrivers
i
think
its
the
aspicd
supports
a
norst
paramter
which
means
to
not
reset
the
scsi
bus
when
it
loads
this
fixed
the
problem
a
friend
of
mine
was
having
with
his
adaptectosh
regards
terje
