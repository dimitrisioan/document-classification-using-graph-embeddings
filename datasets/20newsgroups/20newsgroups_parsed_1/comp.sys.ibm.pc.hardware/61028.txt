please
read
i
have
uploaded
the
most
recent
windows
drivers
for
the
cirrus
gd
chip
based
display
cards
to
the
uploads
directory
at
ftpcicaindianaedu
file
is
drzip
theyre
very
recent
i
downloaded
them
from
the
cirrus
bbs
last
night
if
you
are
unable
to
get
them
there
email
me
and
maybe
i
can
upload
them
to
some
other
sites
as
well
i
have
a
local
bus
based
card
vl
bitblaster
from
micron
but
i
think
the
drivers
work
with
isa
cards
or
at
least
includes
drivers
for
them
i
found
the
new
drivers
to
be
a
significant
improvement
over
the
version
improving
my
graphic
winmarks
v
by
about
million
to
although
this
could
be
the
result
of
intentional
benchmark
cheating
on
cirruss
part
but
i
dont
think
so
from
steve
gibsons
columnist
for

world
graphic
card
comparisons
also
found
at
the
cica
ftp
site
under
the

my

vl
bitblaster
its
no
viper
but
i
think
its
a
hell
of
a
deal
at
about
a
third
of
the
cost
of
the
ati
card
and
when
compared
to
the
other
cards
included
in
gibsons
review
micron
system
owners
i
would
be
interested
to
hear
your
opinions
on
the
dtc
vl
local
bus
disk
controller
my
system
came
with
a
maxtor
drive
mb
and
at
first
was
only
giving
me
disk
winmarks
of
about
kbs
i
am
now
at
kbs
is
this
about
as
good
as
it
gets
i
cant
get
a
nortons
sysinfo
disk
reading
because
the
contoller
intercepts
the
calls
at
least
that
was
what
the
program
said
