would
you
care
to
explain
to
me
then
how
my
soundblaster
pro
card
and
my

card
are
sharing
irq
successfully

you
can
configure
devices
for
the
same
irq
as
long
as
you
dont
use
them
simultaneously
under
dos
at
least
both
lpt
and
sb
just
sit
there
until
you
tell
them
to
do
something
you
cant
configure
a
soundblaster
for
irq
if
you
got
an
ethernet
card
which
hits
that
irq
a
thousand
times
or
so
per
second
