from
aj
rowatt
they
dont
have
a
conflict
because
technically
lpt
does
not
use
irq
the
parallel
printer
processor
the
actual
number
escapes
me
contains
a
printer
control
register
which
enables
the
chip
to
transmit
an
interrupt
to
the
interrupt
controller
as
irq
then
onto
the
main
processor
as
int
xf
by
default
the
parallel
printer
processor
does
not
enable
its
interrupt
line
therefore
no
int
xfs
will
be
sourced
from
the
printer
controller
chip
thus
enabling
other
devices
to
use
the
actual
irq
note
this
applies
to
com
ports
also
which
by
default
do
not
route
interrupts
to
the
system
bus
although
coms
software
usually
enable
this
feature
as
it
make
monitoring
com
port
activity
easier
than
polling
the
serial
uart
thus
probably
getting
the
sound
card
slighty
confused
windows
may
be
a
different
story
