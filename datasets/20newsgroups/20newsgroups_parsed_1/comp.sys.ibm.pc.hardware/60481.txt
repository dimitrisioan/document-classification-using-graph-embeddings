apr
a
friend
of
mine
got
a
mag
of
the
above
model
and
it
had
some
distrotion
so
he
sent
it
back
unfortunately
the
replacement
also
was
distorted
i
would
bet
its
a
common
problem
the
best
advice
ive
heard
when
buying
monnitors
is
to
actually
look
at
the
specific
one
you
will
buy
as
opposed
to
model
since
monitor
manufacturing
even
from
big
names
still
tends
to
produce
alot
of
monitors
with
visible
defects
