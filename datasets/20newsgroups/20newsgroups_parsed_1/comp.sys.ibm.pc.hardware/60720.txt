just
taken
delivery
of
a
mhz
dx
machine
and
very
nice
it
is
too
one
query
the
landmark
speed
when
turbo
is
on
is
or
something
mhz
thats
not
the
problem
the
problem
is
the
speed
when
turbo
is
off
its
mhz
the
equivalent
in
car
terms
is
having
a
nice
porsche
with
a
button
that
turns
it
into
a
skateboard
does
anyone
have
a
clue
as
to
what
determines
the
relative
performance
of
turbo
vs
nonturbo
i
would
like
to
set
it
to
give
a
landmark
speed
of
about
or
mhz
with
turbo
off
cheers
it
should
be
halved
that
of
turbo
ie
mhz
