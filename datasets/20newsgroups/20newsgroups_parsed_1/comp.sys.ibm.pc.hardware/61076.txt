soundblaster
irq
and

settings
discussing
the
use
of
irq

recent

i
as
a
number
of
poeple
in
this
thread
have
already
written
i
cant
prove
its
true
but
i
believe
it
lpt
does
not
actually
use
irq
even
though
that
interrupt
is
supposed
to
be
dedicated
to
lpt
to
put
it
a
little
differently
irq
is
the
de
facto
standard
interrupt
assigned
to
be
used
by
the
printer
adapter
to
announce
its
completion
of
some
activity
dos
doesnt
monitor
irq
it
uses
other
means
to
determine
when
its
time
to
send
out
another
byte
to
the
printer
most
all
hardware
printer
adapters
have
the
ability
to
disable
the
use
of
irq
usually
by
merely
breaking
the
connection
between
the
isa
pin
and
the
associated
driver
other
adapters
control
the
irq
line
by
a
tristate
driver
and
by
programming
just
leave
it
in
the
highimpedence
mode
unfortunately
there
are
a
lot
of
adapter
cards
which
use
bistate
drivers
ie
either
assert
high
or
assert
low
for
the
irq
lines
rather
than
tristate
drivers
assert
high
assert
low
or
dont
assert
anything
the
presence
of
such
a
card
on
an
irq
line
precludes
the
use
of
that
irq
by
any
other
adapter
unless
it
is
physically
disconnected
by
a
jumper
incidentally
note
that
theres
no
requirement
that
a
card
hold
the
irq
line
low
when
no
interrupt
is
desired
if
that
were
true
you
would
have
to
somehow
tie
down
all
unconnected
irq
lines
and
that
certainly
isnt
a
requirement
nondos
operating
systems
os
nt
various
unices
or
whatever
the
proper
plural
of
unix
might
be
require
the
use
of
irq
for
performance
reasons
and
the
sb
alas
is
one
of
the
cards
which
uses
bistate
drivers
