anybody
seen
the
date
get
stuck
im
running
msdos
with
a
menu
system
alive
all
the
time
the
machine
is
left
running
all
the
time
suddenly
the
date
no
longer
rolls
over
the
time
is
reasonably
accurate
allways
but
we
have
to
change
the
date
by
hand
every
morning
this
involves
exiting
the
menu
system
to
get
to
dos
anyone
have
the
slightest
idea
why
this
should
be
even
a
clue
as
to
whether
the
hardware
battery
cmos
or
dos
is
broken
