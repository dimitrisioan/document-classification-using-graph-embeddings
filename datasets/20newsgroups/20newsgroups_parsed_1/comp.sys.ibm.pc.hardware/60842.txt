michael
shapiro
had
the
unmitigated
gall
to
say
this
ms
the
dos
system
date
has
a
twentyfour
hour
clock
and
a
rollover
bit
ms
when
the
system
crosses
midnight
the
rollover
bit
is
turned
on
ms
subsequent
reads
of
the
time
add
one
theres
no
change
possible
ms
this
information
was
current
up
through
dos
ive
not
checked
to
ms
see
whether
it
applies
to
later
versions
just
a
small
tidbit
with
the
advent
of
dos
and
later
versions
ms
added
a
small
feature
to
the
dos
time
function
if
a
program
sets
the
dos
clock
via
dos
system
services
then
dos
will
set
the
bios
clock
to
the
same
value
this
breaks
the
isolation
between
the
two
clocks
that
used
to
ensure
that
errors
in
the
dos
clock
did
not
bleed
over
into
the
bios
clock
sometimes
the
microsoft
people
just
