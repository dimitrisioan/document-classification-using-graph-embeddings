would
someone
be
willing
to
explain
to
me
the
dx
mhz
is
not
more
popular
than
it
is
i
would
think
it
would
be
just
as
fast
if
not
faster
than
the
dx
mhz
for
certian
applications
plus
a
mhz
motherboard
would
seem
better
if
you
had
any
plans
on
upgrading
the
chip
in
the
future
i
must
be
missing
something
since
everyone
is
buying
the
dx
many
adds
dont
even
mention
the
dx
one
of
the
things
going
for
the
dx
over
the
is
that
its
clock
speed
complies
with
the
vesa
local
bus

a
couple
other
problems
with
the
dx
system
manufacturers
had
major
problems
solving
the
electromagnetic
interference
problems
with
dx
systems
getting
an
fccb
home
use
certification
required
additional
shielding
in
the
system
heata
lot
of
people
seem
to
be
installing
heat
sinks
andor
cooling
fans
on
their
dx
chips
i
would
guess
that
the
dx
ran
temperatures
inside
the
case
even
hotter
and
heat
is
the
enemy
of
system
reliability
