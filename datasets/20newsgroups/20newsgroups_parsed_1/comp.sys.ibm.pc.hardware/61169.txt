subject
re
date
is
stuck
ive
posted
a
couple
of
notes
about
encountering
this
problem
based
on
some
suggestions
from
mark
aitchison
university
of
canterbury
new
zealand
and
chris
a
larrieu
cswmedu
i
think
that
my
problem
is
a
screen
saver
that
also
outputs
sound
to
my
pc
speaker
im
still
looking
at
some
of
the
other
screen
savers
that
i
use
with
a
randomizer
but
this
one
definately
caused
the
loss
of
several
minutes
over
night
but
not
the
date
