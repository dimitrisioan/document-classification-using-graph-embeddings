vs
dx
ay
in
many
recent
advertisements
i
have
seen
both
dx
and
dx
aybased
systems
does
the
first
really
exists
and
does
it
imply
that
all
aycircuitry
on
the
motherboard
with
it
works
at
that
speed
as
opposite
aylatter
where
only
the
internals
of
the

are
working
at

yes
there
is
a
dx
and
dx
version
of
the
mhz
if
you
are
considering
buying
one
or
the
other
definitely
go
for
the
dx
with
a
nice
size
external
cache
the
performance
is
far
greater
the
dx
only
has
the
internal
k
cache
to
work
with
at
mhz
while
the
dx
has
a
potentially
much
larger
cache
to
work
at
mhz
with
neither
systems
could
actually
run
a
program
out
of
main
memory
since
dram
is
still
too
slow
for
that
high
of
bus
