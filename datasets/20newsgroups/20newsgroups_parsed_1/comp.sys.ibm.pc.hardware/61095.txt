card
info

hi
that
might
look
like
a
dull
request
but
i
have
been
following
this
newgroup
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
it
didnt
help
me
make
my
mind
i
bought
a
new
machine
not
long
ago
after
being
disconnected
from
the
pc
world
for
a
while
i
have
been
running
on
an
xt
mhz
till
last
january
the
machine
i
bought
came
equipped
with
a
ati
vga
xl
graphic
card
it
gives
a
very
nice
picture
and
the
windows
drivers
are
pretty
stable
the
only
problem
is
that
it
is
quite
slow
i
would
like
to
go
for
a
faster
card
not
in
the
range
i
saw
a
lot
of
comments
on
many
products
over
the
last
weeks
but
didnt
get
an
overall
picture
clear
enough
to
make
a
choice
my
question
is
could
somebody
direct
me
to
a
source
of
information
which
would
help
me
in
my
quest
i
would
like
to
get
information
about
the
refresh
rates
the
various
cards
provide
quality
of
windows
drivers
standard
vga
performance
nonwindows
stuff
direct
me
to
a
magazine
article
or
something
like
that
i
got
winvidzip
info
but
it
is
not
enough
if
you
have
an
isa
card
you
are
really
satisfied
with
it
let
me
know
if
this
information
is
of
any
use
here
is
my
system
configuration
fujikama
mhz
isa
system
contaq
motherboard
monitor
darius
noninterlaced
multisync
up
to
x
can
reach
khz
horizontally
i
would
also
like
to
know
if
it
is
a
standard
for
video
drivers
to
allow
screen
dimensioning
and
screen
positioning
by
writing
on
the
eprom
of
the
graphic
card
this
is
the
case
with
my
ati
card
and
it
is
very
convenient
when
changing
graphics
mode
since
my
monitor
is
not
intelligent
enough
to
record
settings
merci
a
lavance
for
any
information
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
provide
me
