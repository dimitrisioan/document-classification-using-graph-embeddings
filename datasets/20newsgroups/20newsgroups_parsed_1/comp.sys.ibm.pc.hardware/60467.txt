heck
if
ide
used
dma
then
youd
hear
all
kinds
of
complaints
about
isa
bus
systems
with
more
than
m
ram
not
working
with
their
ide
drives
m
is
the
dma
addressing
limit
of
the
isa
bus
and
if
ide
did
dma
there
would
be
trouble
there
would
be
no
problems
as
long
as
the
os
didnt
set
up
a
dma
transfer
to
an
area
above
the
mb
area
the
dma
controller
probably
cant
be
programmed
that
way
anyways
so
there
probably
isint
a
problem
with
this
besides
like
i
said
before
the
fdd
controller
uses
dma
channel
and
i
dont
yet
believe
that
the
hdd
controllers
any
of
them
mfm
rll
etc
dont
also
use
dma
