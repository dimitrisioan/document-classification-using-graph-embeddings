what
is
the
recommended
monitor
for
xga
can
i
just
use
any
old
svga
monitor
or

something
more
needed
mostly
curious
before
i
go
blowing
a
monster
wad
of
cash
on
a
new
system
xga
or
xga
for
the
original
xga
you
just
need
something
that
can
do
x
at
hz
interlaced
just
tell
them
compatible
and
they
should
get
the
idea
for
the
xga
get
what
you
like
i
prefer
multi
syncs
like
the
ibm
the
necs
or
even
a
fixed
frequency
monitor
like
my
home
viewsonic
i
like
the
multisyncs
because
its
easy
to
run
them
in
modes
like
xxk
colors
noninterlaced
or
at
higher
modes
like
