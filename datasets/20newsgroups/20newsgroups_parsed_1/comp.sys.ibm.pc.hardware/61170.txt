i
have
an
internal
modem
that
i
configure
as
com
with
irq
but
when
i
insert
that
card
into
my
dos
pc
it
shows
up
as
com
with
irq
and
coms
address
e
when
i
get
into
debug
and
dump
the
data
at
it
shows
the
address
e
as
belonging
to
com
even
though
the
modem
should
be
at
com
this
is
a
common
misconception
shared
my
many
manufacturers
programmers
and
users
alike
com
for
example
is
simply
the
third
equipped
comm
port
not
necessarily
the
one
with
io
address
e
the
bios
just
searches
sequentially
through
a
set
of
potential
comm
port
addresses
the
first
equipped
port
it
finds
will
become
com
etc
if
youre
playing
by
the
rules
you
cant
have
a
com
unless
you
have
a
com
equipped
the
set
of
standard
whatever
that
means
port
addresses
merely
reflects
the
order
in
which
the
bios
searches
the
io
address
space
in
its
search
for
serial
ports
so
what
you
have
is
indeed
com
at
the
nonstandard
address
e
were
this
address
in
the
th
table
slot
instead
programs
which
query
the
bios
to
determine
the
number
of
installed
comm
ports
would
not
find
it
as
the
field
in
the
bios
data
area
which
contains
this
number
would
indicate
that
there
are
but
comm
ports
installed
frankly
i
dont
know
of
a
simgle
program
that
would
actually
have
a
problem
with
this
