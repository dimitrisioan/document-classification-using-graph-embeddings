datasave
videostreamer
a
few
weeks
ago
i
saw
an
ad
in
the
german
magazine
ct
about
a
socalled
videostreamer
this
is
an
interface
between
a
pcs
parallel
port
and
any
videorecorder
for
backing
up
your
data
on
a
videotape
the
company
datasave
claims
that
it
can
store
up
to
gb
on
a
minutes
tape
it
costs
dm
about
usd
i
think
my
question
is
does
anybody
use
this
product
if
yes
how
many
bytes
really
fit
on
a
minutes
tape
gb
sounds
quite
unbelievable
to
me
however
any
comments
on
the
interface
are
appreciated
please
mail
your
replies
directly
to
me
i
will
sum
up
if
neccesary
thanks
in
advance
