perhaps
this
is
a
silly
question
but
here
goes
what
is
the
difference
between
the
us
robotics
courier
vbis
external
and
the
sportster
external
i
see
that
the
price
of
a
sportster
has
dramatically
dropped
to
below
but
the
price
of
the
courier
remains
above
anyone
with
knowledge
of
both
of
these
modems
or
anyone
that
owns
a
courier
id
really
appreciate
your
comments
before
i
decide
on
which
one
i
buy
thanks
in
advance
and
thanks
again
to
those
that
replies
to
us
robotics
info
wanted
kevin
the
courier
looks
a
lot
cooler
the
courier
is
upgradable
to
vfast
you
have
to
give
usr
more
money
for
that
tho
the
sportster
is
able
to
be
modified
to
be
a
dual
standard
if
you
want
to
void
your
warantee
and
totally
piss
usr
off
