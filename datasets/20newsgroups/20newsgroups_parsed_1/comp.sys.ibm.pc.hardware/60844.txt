where
can
i
buy
a
bios
on
ikos
had
the
unmitigated
gall
to
say
this
ik
im
in
the
market
to
upgrade
my
bios
to
a
phoenix
got
a
new
hard
ik
disk
discovered
my
bios
doesnt
have
a
type
and
i
would
like
ik
know
where
i
can
purchase
one
of
these
things
call
phoenix
they
can
put
you
on
line
with
replacement
bios
chips
i
had
to
do
this
when
i
upgraded
a
emerson
to
an
ide
drive
also
if
you
are
installing
an
ide
drive
and
there
is
a
bios
setting
that
has
a
total
volume
the
same
as
the
ide
drives
volume
try
using
it
the
ide
drive
can
usually
respond
to
a
variety
of
different
geometries
as
long
as
the
setting
that
you
use
is
equal
to
or
smaller
than
the
drives
actual
size
the
controller
will
do
the
necessary
translation
automatically
in
most
cases
warning
do
not
use
a
bios
setting
that
is
even
one
byte
larger
than
the
actual
size
of
the
drive
a
smaller
setting
will
not
harm
the
drive
but
you
will
be
sorry
if
you
go
even
one
byte
over
drive
damage
will
not
result
but
headaches
will
backup
not
found
abort
retry
