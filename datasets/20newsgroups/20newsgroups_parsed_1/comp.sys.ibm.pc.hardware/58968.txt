hi
i
recently
switched
my
old
amiga
with
a

my
computer
configuration
is

harddisk
scsi
ultrastorf
eisa
cache
controller
when
i
use
norton
harddisk
benchmark
i
get
a
harddisk
data
transfer
about
kbsec
and
sometimes
mbsec
is
that
good
i
thought
that
with
eisa
i
could
get
about
mbsec
somewhere
in
the
manual
for
my
harddisk
i
have
read
that
some
host
adapters
need
to
perform
a
lowlevel
format
to
optimize
the
harddisk
performance
in
that
system
do
i
need
that
a
guy
i
know
gets
a
hd
transfer
about
mbsec
and
he
has
an
sta
and
a
isa
dx
how
can
a
isa
with
the
same
system
be
faster
is
there
anything
that
i
can
do
to
get
a
speedier
harddisk
dont
rely
on
benchmarks
they
often
show
incorrect
due
to
different
tsr
programs
scsi
often
needs
a
driver
to
get
the
speed
from
the
card
make
sure
the
card
is
operating
in
synchronus
mode
which
is
x
faster
you
can
disable
disconnect
and
get
some
kbs
but
just
to
loose
the
mouse
or
other
ints
when
diskaccesing
i
get
mbs
with
dx
lb
and
