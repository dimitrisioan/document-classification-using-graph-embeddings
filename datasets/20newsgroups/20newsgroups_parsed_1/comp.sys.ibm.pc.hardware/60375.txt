help
with
olivetti
floppy
we
are
trying
to
connect
an
olivetti
xm
floppy
drive
as
the
second
drive
on
a
panasonic
machine
it
seems
to
sort
of
talk
to
it
gets
it
spinning
and
stepping
but
gives
a
disk
not
ready
error
there
are
two
jumpers
which
seem
to
work
best
open
a
position
dip
switch
and
a
position
dip
switch
we
dont
know
how
to
set
the
dip
switches
and
think
that
may
be
the
problem
any
information
or
advice
other
than
junk
the
stupid
thing
would
be
most
appreciated
thanks
