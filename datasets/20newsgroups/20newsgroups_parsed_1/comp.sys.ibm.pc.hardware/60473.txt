from
wayne
mcdougall
facts
a
netware
server
a
was
roughly
moved
to
a
new
location
and
left
powered
down
for
three
months
from
memory
it
has
an
mb
hard
drive
manuals
and
original
disks
are
for
sft
netware
level
ii
va
when
powered
up
the
cmos
was
wiped
a
technician
examined
it
and
pronounced
the
disk
drive
unusable
my
investigations
indicate
that
drive
c
is
a
type
cylinders
sides
when
cmos
set
this
way
compsurf
runs
happily
with
bad
blocks
i
use
prepare
to
hotfix
the
one
internal
drive
install
will
proceed
successfully
but
when
i
try
to
boot
the
server
it
reports
that
the
software
is
not
serialised
for
this
hardware
internal
examination
indicates
that
the
keycard
is
present
and
there
is
one
disk
drive
or
at
least
one
large
single
unit
attempts
to
configure
a
second
drive
in
cmos
result
in
drive
not
ready
errors
questions
the
software
is
netware
level
ii
and
i
can
see
burnt
on
to
the
screen
sft
netware
level
ii
va
however
to
configure
netware
for
level
ii
mirrored
or
duplexed
disks
requires
a
second
disk
yes
so
how
is
the
novell
server
a
normally
configured
can
i
install
sft
netware
level
ii
va
as
level
i
or
is
this
what
is
causing
my
serialisation
error
is
the
novell
server
a
normally
equipped
with
two
hard
drives
one
of
which
has
failed
would
this
mean
i
can
not
install
the
network
software
because
it
will
not
be
serialised
for
this
hardware
with
a
failed
drive
what
else
can
cause
a
serialisation
error
what
happens
if
the
keycard
fails
am
i
doing
something
wrong
can
someone
knowledgeable
offer
some
comments
and
guides
thanks
for
your
time
apology
i
appreciate
that
i
have
posted
this
request
somewhat
widely
as
im
dealing
with
somewhat
archaic
hardware
and
software
im
hoping
that
by
casting
my
net
further
im
more
likely
to
capture
someone
who
has
met
this
system
before
i
believe
i
can
justify
the
groups
to
which
i
am
posting
please
feel
free
to
correct
me
if
you
feel
this
is
an
inappropriate
place
to
post
this
this
posting
is
definitive
