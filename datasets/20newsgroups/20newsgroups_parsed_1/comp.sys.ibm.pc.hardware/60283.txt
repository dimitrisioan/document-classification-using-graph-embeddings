fujitsu
and
seagate
ide
drive
compatibility
ive
been
trying
to
get
my
fujitsu
mt
mb
hard
disk
circa
to
share
my
ide
card
with
a
new
seagate
sta
mb
one
ive
tried
fiddling
the
jumpers
to
set
the
master
and
slave
drives
without
any
success
without
the
table
of
hard
drive
specs
from
this
newsgroup
i
couldnt
have
got
that
far
has
anyone
else
got
this
combination
to
work
the
place
i
got
the
new
one
muttered
something
like
hmmm
fujitsu
nice
drives
not
very
compatible
hell
let
me
swap
the
seagate
for
another
brand
but
he
thought
it
was
more
a
problem
with
the
fujitsu
so
has
anyone
got
a
similar
fujitsu
drive
to
work
with
another
cheapish
disk
or
want
to
buy
a
cute
and
cuddly
little
fujitsu
drive
