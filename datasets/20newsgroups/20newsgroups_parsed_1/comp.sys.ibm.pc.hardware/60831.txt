i
also
am
having
a
problem
with
com
on
a
gk
system
i
have
a
gateway
k
dx
system
with
the
ati
ultrapro
video
card
identical
to
the
system
mentioned
in
the
original
posting
except
mhz
instead
of
for
some
reason
the
system
refuses
to
recognize
com
for
example
if
i
configure
the
onboard
motherboard
com
ports
for
comcom
everything
is
fine
if
i
configure
them
for
comcom
com
works
ok
but
com
is
not
recoznized
the
diagnostics
shipped
with
the
system
the
msd
utility
windows
all
act
as
if
the
port
isnt
there
its
not
an
irq
conflict
because
i
can
swap
the
irqs
for
com
and
com
and
com
still
works
and
com
still
doesnt
i
actually
noticed
this
problem
when
trying
to
install
additional
ports
a
boca
high
speed
sp
card
the
behavior
with
the
boca
card
was
exactly
the
same
eg
it
would
work
as
com
com
or
com
but
not
as
com
this
has
the
smell
of
an
io
port
conflict
but
i
cant
imagine
with
what
there
are
no
other
expansion
cards
installed
in
the
machine
other
than
the
video
card
and
gateway
would
have
to
be
pretty
stupid
to
have
the
onboard
com
conflict
with
something
else
on
the
motherboard
has
anybody
else
had
this
problem
i
ran
into
this
about
six
months
ago
my
system
is
a
gw
dxv
megs
ram
meg
ati
gup
vlb
it
seems
the
problem
is
that
the
ati
graphics
ultra
pro
card
consumes
the
com
port
for
some
reason
so
only
com
are
available
i
believe
this
is
documented
somewhere
in
the
system
manuals
but
i
cant
recall
where
