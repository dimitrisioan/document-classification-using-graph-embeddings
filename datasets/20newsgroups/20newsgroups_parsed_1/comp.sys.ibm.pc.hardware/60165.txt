references
needed
on
memory
management
i
am
doing
a
report
on
the
topic
of
advanced
memory
management
and
need
to
know
of
some
good
references
to
cover
this
topic
it
is
an
analytical
chemistry
class
on
instrumental
analysis
so
as
you
could
guess
it
doesnt
have
to
be
an
extremely
thorough
or
extensive
covering
of
the
topic
also
i
am
a
chemical
engineer
and
know
some
but
not
too
much
about
memory
management
if
anyone
could
help
point
me
in
a
good
direction
i
would
be
very
thankful
thanks
in
advance
