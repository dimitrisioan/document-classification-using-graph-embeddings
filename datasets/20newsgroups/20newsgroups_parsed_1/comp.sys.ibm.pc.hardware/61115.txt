come
to
think
of
it
though
i
hear
and
see
a
lot
of
complaints
about
the
ati
boards
too
though
recent
word
looks
like
the
build
code
looks
much
better
build
still
has
a
number
of
problemssheared
fonts
for
instance
if
you
have
crystal
fonts
enabled
some
other
problems
color
darkening
and
some
others
i
dont
use
the
drivers
in
any
mode
other
than
xx
so
if
there
are
bugs
in
the
other
modes
i
cant
say
does
anyone
have
an
accelerated
video
board
with
drivers
for
windows
os
where
all
the
modes
function
properly
anyone
anyone
to
be
honest
up
until
now
i
have
only
found
one
bug
in
the
diamond
viper
drivers
and
it
seems
innocuous
that
is
under
microsoft
word
select
format
border
click
shading
and
take
a
look
at
the
patterns
the
pattern
has
been
swapped
with
the
and
so
on
the
whole
list
is
completely
reversedlooks
right
onscreen
but
take
it
to
another
machine
ie
a
gup
or
ssx
machine
or
print
it
and
iy
showsbadly
keep
in
mind
that
i
use
mainly
xxk
mode
so
i
cant
speak
for
the
others
but
otherwise
these
drivers
seem
pretty
solid
whats
big
noisy
and
has
an
iq
of
operation
rescue
