would
someone
be
willing
to
explain
to
me
the
dx
mhz
is
not
more
popular
than
it
is
i
would
think
it
would
be
just
as
fast
if
not
faster
than
the
dx
mhz
for
certian
applications
plus
a
mhz
motherboard
would
seem
better
if
you
had
any
plans
on
upgrading
the
chip
in
the
future
i
must
be
missing
something
since
everyone
is
buying
the
dx
many
adds
dont
even
mention
the
dx
thanks
a
lot
matt
yes
its
realy
simple
no
one
makes
a
mother
board
that
runs
the
bus
at
more
than
mhzsam
this
isnt
quite
true
depending
on
the
number
of
local
bus
slots
and
whether
or
not
the
device
is
integrated
into
the
mother
board
it
is
possible
to
run
local
bus
at
up
to
and
mhz
ive
also
spoken
to
a
few
people
who
run
standard
local
bus
video
cards
at
mhz
without
trouble
and
a
couple
of
people
who
couldnt
get
a
lb
card
to
work
at
that
speed
