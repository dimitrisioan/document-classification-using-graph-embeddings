if
youre
considering
buying
a
system
with
a
view
to
using
it
to
run
unix
linux
bsd
etc
or
some
other
special
software
there
is
a
good
chance
that
it
will
not
work
with
the
diamond
cards
this
is
due
to
diamonds
propriety
attitude
to
its
hardware
its
impossible
to
get
free
information
from
them
about
their
chips
specifically
their
dotclocks
without
paying
and
signing
nondisclosure
agreements
this
made
it
impossible
for
the
free
software
foundation
to
provide
xwindows
compatibility
with
these
cards
as
diamond
didnt
want
to
divulge
programming
neccessities
i
dont
think
the
two
main
free
x
systems
xs
and
xfree
are
part
of
the
fsf
as
such
considering
the
above
and
some
postings
about
diamonds
bad
attitute
towars

i
ordered
and
actixge
vlb
m
card
it
will
arive

anyone
know
of
