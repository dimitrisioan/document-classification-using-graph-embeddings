i
heard
the
rumor
as
well
but
the
story
differed
intel
was
not
coming
out
with
the
tripling
clock
a
clone
from
ibm
was
no
rumour
ibms
clock
tripling
chip
was
seen
in
some
trade
show
last
fall
comdex
or
something
i
wasnt
there
all
you
people
who
are
drooling
after
this
chip
do
realize
that
it
has
no
fpu
just
like
sx
that
evil
marketing
ploytm
from
intel
dont
you
it
has
k
of
internal
cache
which
probably
is
where
the
saved
silicon
real
estate
went
because
of
some
contract
ibm
is
not
allowed
to
sell
its
chips
to
third
parties
so
these
chips
are
unlikely
to
become
available
in
any
nonibm
machines
of
course
nothing
prevents
other
companies
from
implementing
a
dx
but
nobody
hasnt
even
come
out
with
a
real
dx
fpu
and
all
clone
yet
although
amd
soon
will
segmented
memory
helps
structure
software
