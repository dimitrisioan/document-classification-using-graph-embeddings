hello
all
you
the
net
are
my
last
resort
or
ill
just
change
my
job
this
might
be
a
faq
eg
mixing
controllers
but
havent
seen
any
sys
ami
bios
and
your
runofthe
mill
multiio
card
with
serialsparalfloppies
and
ide
controller
clone
gwex
there
are
no
jumpers
affecting
the
hd
or
ctrller

want
to
bring
in
this

bios
type
ctrller
manages
the
real

esdi
ctrller
no
floppies
jumpers
set
irq

port

and
bios
addr
ccc
and
other
floppyformat
stuff
goal
have
the
wd
esdi
as
a
secondarycontroller
and
have
both
disks
simultaneously
working
being
able
to
boot
from
the
esdi
too
would
be
a
nice
bonus
but
is
not
expected
ultimate
goal
have
room
for
linux
et
al
ex
of
scheme
i
have
in
mind
boot
from
ide
hd
or
floppy
and
mount
the
esdi
as
root
not
booting
from
esdi
or
even
from
hd
is
acceptable
i
have
tried
numerous
all
combinations
to
no
avail
they
work
alone
or
can
coexist
witout
hangups
but
cant
access
the
esdi
or
the
ide
depending
on
setupjumpers
useful
suggestions
might
be
how
do
i
tell
the
bios
setup
about
two
ctrllers
i
guess
the
nd
hd
is
expected
to
hang
off
the
same
ctrller
as
the
st
do
i
need
some
driver
to
make
it
work
some
new
bioschip
for
any
of
these
cards
do
i
have
to
buy
another
controller
to
make
them
hds
happy
ide
is
cheaper
esdi
is
hard
to
find
and
rather
costly
im
not
rich
or
i
wouldnt
try
to
scavenge
around
so
soft
slns
are
preferred
adapters
of
some
sort
i
can
hold
a
soldering
iron
and
can
change
a
chip
or
put
a
jumper
also
useful
bbs
or
hotline
of
western
digital
ftp
archives
with
relevant
info
expert
stores
in
toronto
ontario
area
that
would
be
a
miracle
havent
seen
any
really
knowledgeable
ppl
in
a
while
any
hints
into
inner
workings
of
the
system
anything
else
that
helped
you
in
similar
situations
prayers
direct
or
posted
replies
are
ok
many
thanks
