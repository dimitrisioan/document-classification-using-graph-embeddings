that
is
for
my
wife
i
just
purchased
a
viewsonic
for
myself
and
am
looking
for
a
graphics
card
to
drive
it
i
want
hz
refresh
and
would
really
like
it
to
handle
my
cdroms
i
tried
the
orchid
p
which
did
neither
of
those
things
though
robert
at
wietek
did
say
that
the
hz
was
possible
if
i
modifed
the
driver
data
base
so
my
thoughts
go
back
to
hercules
they
were
supposed
to
be
coming
out
with
a
vlb
version
of
the
graphite
around
the
end
of
march
i
have
heard
precisely
zero
about
it
since
then
does
anyone
know
if
the
card
was
actually
released
and
what
capabilities
and
price
it
has
hmm
your
cdrom
program
must
be
using
some
oddball
vga
modes
i
think
they
are
trying
to
get
it
out
by
the
end
of
this
month
when
it
is
released
though
itll
be
in
limited
quantities
i
think
they
have
quite
a
back
order
right
now
the
megs
version
will
come
out
a
bit
later
since
you
have
a
viewsonic
i
think
it
has
a
khz
horizontal
frequency
right
youre
gon
na
love
the
megs
version
it
can
do
xx
at
hz
xx
at
hz
xx
at
hz
xx
at
hz
it
can
also
do
xx
mil
and
xx
bit
at
hz
too
bad
i
dont
have
such
a
high
bandwidth
monitor
like
yours
most
of
those
modes
need
a
khz
monitor
otherwise
youll
have
to
use
a
lower
refresh
rate
if
you
want
more
info
about
the
coming
graphite
vl
you
should
go
to
the
ibm
hardware
section
on
compuserve
ibmhw
in
the
video
sig
therere
several
hercules
reps
there
that
are
very
helpful
