re
parity
error
system
halted
anyone
have
any
ideas
you
unfortunately
failed
to
mention
if
the
error
occurs
with
the
parity
error
checking
enabled
or
disabled
i
assume
you
mean
it
gives
you
a
parity
error
when
its
enabled
and
not
when
its
disabled
how
high
will
the
count
go
on
the
memory
check
at
bootup
before
this
error
occurs
does
the
system
beep
at
all
if
so
whats
the
pattern
of
beeps
the
error
could
be
occuring
in
cache
memory
not
so
likely
or
video
memory
as
well
as
the
simms
the
fact
that
you
have
ami
bios
is
not
conclusive
in
determining
the
board
manufacturer
either
boards
are
made
by
thousands
of
small
taiwanese
companies
among
others
that
buy
the
name
brand
chips
and
put
them
together
with
some
simm
sockets
to
make
your
board
i
tend
to
doubt
your
problem
is
with
your
ide
controller
also
anyway
perhaps
if
you
answer
those
questions
someone
can
help
you
out
better
