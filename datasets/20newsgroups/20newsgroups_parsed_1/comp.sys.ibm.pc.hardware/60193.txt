when
i
look
at
a
magazine
ad
that
says
deleted
what
exactly
do
the
numbers
mean
ie
which
is
the
mb
ns
the
numbers
and
refers
to
nanoseconds
could
someone
explain
exactly
what
this
numbers
means
time

bettwen

request
and
answer
retrieved
in
case
of
reading
it
means
the
time
required
for
the
memory
to
refresh
ie
a
x
needs
ns
before
it
is
ready
to
be
read
again
nope
its
the
time
taken
to
read
data
from
memory
its
the
read
time
the
memory
will
still
have
to
be
refreshed
the
whole
phase
is
called
a
cycle
the
cycle
time
being
about
twice
the
access
time
im
sorry
if
im
misunderstanding
your
post
but
dram
does
not
have
to
be
refreshed
on
each
access
cycle
so
cycle
time
does
not
have
to
be
twice
the
access
time
because
of
refresh
phase
the
access
time
usually
means
the
delay
time
from
falling
edge
of
raw

strobe

yes
the
cycle
time
is
more
than
twice
as
the
access
time
but
not
because
of
the
refresh

the

can
be
done
either
as
