is
crap
it
writes
about
slower
than
stacker
reads
about
slower
and
compresses
about
less
all
tests
were
made
on
the

computer
with
the

disk
no
cache
and
the

big

were
used
couldnt

more
on
my
i
dont
miss
the
speed
its
still
faster
than
a
normal
disk
read
would
be
as
for
the
less
compression
koberg
i
recall
reading
a
review
article
in
pc
computing
wherein
they
reported
a
reduction
in
the
loading
time
for
lengthy
programs
using
stacker
this
was
not
due
to
the
compression
algorithm
per
se
but
to
the
fact
that
fewer
fetches
were
required
during
the
sequential
file
access
does
anyone
have
any
actual
performance
numbers
relating
to
speeds
of
stacker
and
dblspace
bs
