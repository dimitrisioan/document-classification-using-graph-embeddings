re
ctx
i
started
a
similar
thread
about
a
month
ago
and
got
many
replies
the
summary
ctx
nasty
low
quality
avoid
ctx
proscan
not
as
good
as
some
other
makes
however
cheap
main
problem
seems
poor
quality
control
some
reported
pincushioning
the
problem
i
had
others
poor
focus
etc
etc
i
complained
about
mine
and
it
was
retuned
i
dodnt
even
pay
shipping
and
returned
to
me
in
days
its
now
clear
wellfocussed
and
has
no
pincushioning
or
barrel
distortion
at
all
im
very
happy
with
it
and
the
digital
controls
and
mode
memory
are
nice
certainly
a
trinitron
say
would
be
much
nicer
but
thats
well
out
of
my
price
range
conclusion
if
youre
on
a
budget
get
one
and
be
prepared
to
send
it
back
if
its
not
perfect
it
probably
wont
be
when
you
get
it
but
has
good
potential
