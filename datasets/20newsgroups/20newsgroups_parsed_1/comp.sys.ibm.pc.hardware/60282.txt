re
inth
for
joysticks
is
slow
writes
im
using
inth
to
read
my
joystick
and
it
is
hideously
slow
something
like
of
my
cpu
time
is
being
spent
reading
the
joystick
and
this
is
in
a
program
that
does
nothing
but
printf
and
joyread
the
problem
is
that
a
lot
of
programs
trap
inth
like
smartdrv
and
so
it
is
a
slow
as
hell
interface
can
i
read
the
joystick
port
in
a
reasonably
safe
fashion
via
polling
and
that
isnt
platform
or
clockspeed
specific
the
joystick
reads
in
anolog
values
through
a
digital
port
how
you
send
a
command
to
the
port
to
read
it
then
you
time
how
long
it
takes
for
the
joystick
port
to
set
a
certain
bit
this
time
is
proportional
to
the
joystick
position
obviously
since
time
is
used
as
a
position
you
can
not
get
rid
of
this
ridiculus
waste
of
time
if
you
wrote
your
own
routine
instead
of
the
bios
it
would
speed
it
up
some
but
the
time
would
still
be
there
john
a
slagel
my
old
man
used
to
tell
me
before
he
left
this
shitty
world
never
chase
buses
or
women
you
always
get
left
behind

marlboro
man
