i
saw
a
post
for
the
ultrastor
something
or
other
and
was
wondering
if
this
would
be
a
good
choice
i
need
a
supported
card
that
software
like
the
march
nt
beta
will
recognize
buslogic

always
happens

be
changing

soon
though
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
even
higher
transfer
speeds
with
the
bit
vesa
support
you
can
call
buslogic

ask

the
nt
question
i
