couldnt
help
me
they
want
more
specifics
on
when
it
freezes
up
i
did
anyway
here
it
is
if
the
keyboard
is
left
idle
in
dos
for
more
than
minutes
i
can
type
on
the
command
line
but
as
soon
as
i
hit
a
carraige
return
the
computer
locks
up
this
will
happen
almost
every
time
whether
ive
just
booted
up
reset
or
finished
using
a
dos
program
everything
works
fine
if
i
dont
let
it
sit
windows
is
a
different
story
if
i
let
the
machine
sit
while
in
windows
for
minutes
or
more
it
does
not
freeze
up
however
i
do
get
frequent
application
errors
that
kick
me
out
of
an
application
unexpectedly
losing
my
work
i
just
dont
know
if
this
is
a
hardware
or
software
problem
any
help
in
diagnosis
or
things
to
try
would
be
greatly
appreciated
