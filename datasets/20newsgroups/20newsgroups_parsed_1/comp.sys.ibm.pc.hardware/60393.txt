problem
occasionaly
the
machine
freezes
at
least
thats
what
i
thought
but
recently
i
discovered
that
the
machine
works
just
the
keyboard
freezes
and
the
clock
drops
down
from
turbo
mhz
to
standard
mhz
mode
perhaps
you
hit
the
s
control
s
try
q
i
know
it
doesnt
explain
the
clock
rate
drop
we
had
the
same
problem
in
our
company
we
changed
the
keyboardbios
and
after
that
everything
went
fine
our
dealer
told
us
that
some
boards
of
that
series
have
a
defect
