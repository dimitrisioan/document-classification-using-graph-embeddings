i
would
liek
to
get
a
ide
controller
card
for
my
vlb
dx
motherboard
what
are
good
options
for
this
preferably
under
it
must
also
work
under
os
and
be
compatible
with
stacker
and
other
disk
compression

i
have
a
maxtor
mb
on
an
isa
ide
controller
although
my
machine
is
dx
vlb
i
has
the
save
transfer
rate
of
mbs
regardless
of
the
variations
of
the
isa
bus
speed
i
tested
it
with
speed
between
mhz
and
mhz
not
any
difference
the
problem
is
not
the
