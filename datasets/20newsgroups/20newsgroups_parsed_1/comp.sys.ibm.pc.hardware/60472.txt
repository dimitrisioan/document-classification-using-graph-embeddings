anybody
seen
the
date
get
stuck
im
running
msdos
with
a
menu
system
alive
all
the
time
the
machine
is
left
running
all
the
time
suddenly
the
date
no
longer
rolls
over
the
time
is
reasonably
accurate
allways
but
we
have
to
change
the
date
by
hand
every
morning
this
involves
exiting
the
menu
system
to
get
to
dos
anyone
have
the
slightest
idea
why
this
should
be
even
a
clue
as
to
whether
the
hardware
battery
cmos
or
dos
is
broken
i
bet
it
suddenly
started
sticking
when
you
started
leaving
the
pc
running
the
menu
all
night
there
is
a
limitationbug
in
the
date
rollover
software
in
pcs
that
means
you
have
to
be
doing
something
like
waiting
for
keyboard
input
via
a
dos
call
rather
than
a
bios
call
as
menus
often
use
otherwise
the
code
to
update
the
date
after
midnight
never
gets
called
somebody
might
be
able
to
correct
the
details
in
case
ive
misrememberred
them
but
i
think
you
have
to
change
the
menu
program
if
you
have
the
sources
or
add
a
tsr
or
system
patch
or
something
as
far
as
i
know
the
cmos
clock
keeps
the
right
time
in
fact
about
secondsday
better
than
doss
