i
would
like
to
hear
the
netwisdom
and
netopinions
on
ide
controllers
i
would
liek
to
get
a
ide
controller
card
for
my
vlb
dx
motherboard
what
are
good
options
for
this
preferably
under
it
must
also
work
under
os
and
be
compatible
with
stacker
and
other
disk
compression
sw
i
have
a
maxtor
mb
on
an
isa
ide
controller
although
my
machine
is
dx
vlb
i
has
the
save
transfer
rate
of
mbs
regardless
of
the
variations
of
the
isa
bus
speed
i
tested
it
with
speed
between
mhz
and
mhz
not
any
difference
the
problem
is
not
the
interface
between
the
controller
and
the
memory
my
advice
buy
megs
of
ram
save
and
enjoy
performance

disclaimer
all
oppinions
are
mine
i
also
have
a
dx
and
a
maxtor
i
have
a
local
bus
ide
controller
generic
and
i
get
kbs
i
tried
swapping
my
local
bus
ide
controller
for
an
isa
ide
controller
and
my
transfer
rate
went
to
kbs
the
specs
for
this
drive
show
a
maximum
platter
to
controller
transfer
rate
of
mbs
i
dont
know
how
to
get
there
from
here
the
local
bus
interface
got
me
a
little
but
certainly
not
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
i
am
also
looking
for
a
way
to
improve
my
disk
performance
but
im
not
convinced
that
the
controller
is
the
bottleneck
although
im
willing
to
entertain
the
possibility
that
it
is
i
am
already
running
a
big
main
memory
disk
cache
so
im
not
really
interested
in
this
solution
either
