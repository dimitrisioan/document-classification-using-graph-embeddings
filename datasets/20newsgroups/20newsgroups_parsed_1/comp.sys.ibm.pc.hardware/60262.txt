bye
as
of
today
i
will
no
longer
be
a
contact
for
zeos
international
on
the
net
this
responsibility
has
been
taken
over
by
another
tech
and
i
am
moving
up
and
on
mo
money
mo
money
i
just
wanted
to
thank
all
of
the
netters
who
have
supported
and
encouraged
the
participation
of
zeos
on
the
net
i
personally
feel
it
is
important
for
companies
such
as
zeos
to
provide
their
customers
with
as
easy
access
as
possible
when
they
have
questionsproblems
and
being
on
the
net
is
an
big
step
in
the
right
direction
i
hope
that
other
companies
will
follow
suit
as
weitek
and
others
have
done
again
thanks
