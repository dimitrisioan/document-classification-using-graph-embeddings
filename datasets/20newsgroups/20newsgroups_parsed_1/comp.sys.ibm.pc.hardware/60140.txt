hi
fellow
netters
i
have
a
question
for
you
i
am
gon
na
buy
a
dx
mhz
with
vesa
localbus
is
the
speed
benefit
that
great
would
it
be
wise
to
spend
on
a
localbus
system
hd
controller
and
graphic
card
for
normal
use
i
mean
i
wont
use
it
for
a
server
also
i
read
an
article
from
someone
sorry
i
cant
remember
your
name
and
he
said
that
even
though
you
have
a
localbus
harddisk
controller
your
performances
wont
be
that
much
greater
because
of
the
disks
throughtput
so
what
is
the
use
of
having
a
fast
bus
if
the
peripherals
cant
cope
with
it
something
to
bear
in
mind
is
what
the
v
in
vlb
stands
for
v
for
video
the
origional
intention
of
the
bus
was
to
speed
up
the
bus
so
that
large
memory
to
memory
transfers
would
be
faster
this
is
espically
useful
in
transfering
data
from
main
memory
to
video
memory
since
there
are
usually
vlb
slots
card
makers
have
been
making
cards
to
fit
in
the
other
two
how
about
an
vlb
ethernet
card
move
the
data
into
the
card
at
odd
mbs
and
then
wait
for
it
to
tickle
onto
the
net
at
just
over
mbs
do
do
however
free
the
local
bus
for
other
cards
some
times
you
need
fast
busses
and
sometimes
you
dont
thank
you
