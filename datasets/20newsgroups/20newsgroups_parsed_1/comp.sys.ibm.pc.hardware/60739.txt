so
the
lowly
lowdensity
original
pc
fdd
card
used
dma
and
the
pcat
hdd
controller
doesnt
that
makes
real
sense
actually
it
does
make
a
reasonable
amount
of
sense
fixed
disk
sectors
are
buffered
by
the
controller
and
transferring
them
to
memory
with
a
rep
insw
or
whatever
the
instruction
is
called
is
quite
efficient
single
instruction
goes
as
fast
as
the
controllercpu
know
how
to
use
the
bus
since
the
wasnt
cached
the
bus
is
likely
a
critical
resource
relative
to
cpu
performance
and
its
possible
that
dma
bus
interference
would
cause
as
much
or
more
loss
of
cpu
cycles
for
computing
as
does
the
rep
insw
sequence
the
floppy
on
the
other
hand
is
not
buffered
so
that
using
the
cpu
for
floppy
data
transfer
as
was
done
on
the
pc
jr
by
the
way
really
does
stink
