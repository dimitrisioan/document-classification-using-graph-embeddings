halted
i
have
a
mhz
isa
board
with
kbyte
cache
and
megs
ram
i
just
bought
the
new
soundblaster
and
tried
to
install
the
card
the
sb
uses
bit
dma
channeli
could
select
between
channel
to
it
is
the
first
card
i
ever
installed
that
uses
bit
dma
transfer
after
i
tested
the
card
the
first
time
the
computer
crashed
and
i
got
a
parity
errorsystem
halted
this
happens
either
from
dos
as
also
from
windows
so
it
seems
that
my
bit
dma
channels
are
not
working
properly
they
are
there
because
testsbexe
recocnize
them
and
tests
them
ok
until
first
access
well
does
anybody
know
a
solution
for
this
problem
or
a
special
test
program
for
dma
problems
i
eliminated
the
problem
temporaly
by
using
only
bit
dma
channel
but
it
makes
the
system
slow
thanks
for
your
help
