cd

i
had
this
problem
some
time
ago
some
bioses
do
not
automatically
install
com
or
com
in
the
port
tables
programs
like
most
modem
programs
which
write
directly
to
the
port
work
fine
but
anything
that
uses
a
bios
call
fails
find
a
bbs
or
ftp
site
where
you
can
get
a
copy
of
port
finder
put
devicepfsys
in
your
configsys
or
run
pfcom
from
your
autoexecbat
this
little
program
will
locate
all
existing
ports
and
make
sure
the
bios
tables
are
updated
it
works
great
pf
will
also
let
you
swap
ports
and
such
also
if
that
is
of
any
value
to
you
