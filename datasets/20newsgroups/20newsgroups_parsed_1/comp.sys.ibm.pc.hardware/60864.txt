hi
i
am
buying
a
quantum
lpsat
mb
hardisk
and
is
deciding
a
hddfdd
controller
is
bit
vlbus
hddfdd
controller
faster
than
bit
ide
hddfdd
controller
card
no
vlbus
ide
is
no
faster
than
isa
ide
the
ide
interface
is
fundamentally
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
the
isa
bus
and
if
you
hook
it
to
vlbus
itll
work
as
fast
as
the
slower
of
the
two
meaning
isa
speed
its
not
true
ide
bus
uses
signals
which
has
similar
name
and
same
meaning
to
the
counterpart
of
isa
bus
but
its
ide
bus
signal
timing
doesnt
have
to
be
same
to
isa
signal
timing
my
vlide
bus
card
has
a
set
of
jumpers
to
set
its
transfer
rate
from
mbsec
up
to
mb
sec
the
manufacturer
might
have
to
correct
these
numbers
as
milion
bytesec
and
milion
bytesec
respectively
you
can
not
transfer
data
at
a
rate
of
mbsec
on
the
isa
bus
i
hear
that
the
vl
bus
controller
is
slower
than
a
ide
controller
on
the
other
hand
i
wouldnt
expect
it
to
be
slower
