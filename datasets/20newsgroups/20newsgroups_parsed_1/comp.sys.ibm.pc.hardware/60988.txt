dx
vs
dx
would
someone
be
willing
to
explain
to
me
the
dx
mhz
is
not
more
popular
than
it
is
i
would
think
it
would
be
just
as
fast
if
not
faster
than
the
dx
mhz
for
certian
applications
plus
a
mhz
motherboard
would
seem
better
if
you
had
any
plans
on
upgrading
the
chip
in
the
future
i
must
be
missing
something
since
everyone
is
buying
the
dx
many
adds
dont
even
mention
the
dx
thanks
a
lot
matt
