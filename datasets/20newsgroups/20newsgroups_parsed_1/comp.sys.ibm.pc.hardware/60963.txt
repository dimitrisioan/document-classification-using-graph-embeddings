you
can
find
the
drivers
at
wuarchivewustledu
in
the
msdoswindows
sub
directory
i
think
the
files
are
called
tvgawinazip
and
tvgawinbzip
those
are
the
latest
drivers
available
as
far
as
i
know
i
downloaded
these
files
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
they
appeared
to
be
incompatible
with
this
particular
card
none
of
the
svga
drivers
worked
theyre
probably
for
the
newer
and
series
