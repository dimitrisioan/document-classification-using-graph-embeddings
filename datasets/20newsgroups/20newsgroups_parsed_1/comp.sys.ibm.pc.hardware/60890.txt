its
an
interesting
idea
but
the
worstcase
data
patterns
developed
to
test
magnetic
media
are
totally
different
than
the
patterns
used
to
detect
common
faults
in
memory
chips
i
was
having
major
memory
problems
a
few
monthes
ago
getting
parity
error
system
halted
error
message
in
windows
i
ran
qaplus
check
it
diagnose
as
well
as
several
shareware
memory
checkers
i
had
a
total
of
meg
simm
in
my
system
these
store
bought
shareware
memory
diagnostics
either
ran
fine
without
errors
or
found
an
error
at
some
address
that
i
couldnt
place
on
a
memory
chip
out
of
exahperation
i
came
up
with
the
now
deleted
steps
to
find
bad
memory
chips
i
found
moral
never
buy
memory
stamped
not
for
sensitive
or
critical
applications
on
the
back
anyway
i
did
filter
out
all
the
bad
memory
chips
using
combinations
of
of
the
meg
chips
and
creating
a
ram
drive
to
test
on
although
it
dodnt
alleviate
my
parity
error
problems
in
windows
i
did
manage
to
find
bad
memory
chips
in
this
manner
it
has
never
failed
to
find
a
bad
chip
for
me
and
the
commercial
shareware
have
always
faild
me
either
not
finding
the
error
or
pointing
to
an
addreww
which
i
have
no
idea
on
what
chip
it
is
ps
man
my
typing
stinks
today
and
i
dont
feel
like
futzing
around
