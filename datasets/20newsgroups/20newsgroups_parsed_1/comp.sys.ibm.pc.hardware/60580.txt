bi
am
interested
in
getting
the
pulse
of
this
group
regarding
bextended
operation
of
my
gk
v
with
the
cover
removed
bfrom
the
enclosure
there
are
a
of
reasons
i
am
considering
bthis
including
quick
access
to
jumpers
during
complex
io
card
bsetups
bmy
concern
is
that
without
a
complete
enclosure
to
direct
the
bcooling
flow
of
air
from
the
fan
hot
spots
may
develop
on
my
bmotherboard
or
elsewhere
if
you
have
an
adequate
supply
of
air
moving
over
the
system
most
offices
or
homes
have
positive
ventilation
you
can
generally
run
a
system
without
the
cover
for
extended
periods
without
a
problem
im
talking
about
completely
removing
the
cover
not
just
leaving
the
slots
uncovered
however
the
biggest
reason
you
have
a
cover
to
begin
with
is
rf
sheilding
operating
a
system
without
the
full
cover
may
create
problems
with
other
equipment
such
as
your
neighbors
tv
or
ham
radio
station
very
much
a
nono
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
slmr
a
remember
theyre
only
