you
are
right
in
supposing
that
the
problem
is
with
the
xmncolormap
xtncolormap
for
truly
literate
beings
not
being
set
what
you
want
to
do
is

your
application
with
your
new
colormap
this
can
be
a
chicken
and
egg
sort
of
problem

if
you
look
at
the
xt
faq
there
is
an
example
that
should
show
how
it
can
be
done
if
not
let
me
know
and
maybe
i
can
improve
the
example
