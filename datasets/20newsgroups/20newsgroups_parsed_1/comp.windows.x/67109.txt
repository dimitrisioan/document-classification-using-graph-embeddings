problems
on
aix
i
am
trying
to
build
and
use
imake
xr
on
an
ibm
rs
running
aix
v
i
am
having
the
following
problems
many
of
my
imakefiles
have
contructs
like
this
is
a
makefile
at
the
start
of
lines
to
pass
makefile
comments
thru
the
c
preprocessor
and
into
the
makefile
most
of
the
c
preprocessors
that
i
have
used
will
not
treat
such
a
as
appearing
at
the
start
of
the
line
thus
the
c
preprocessor
does
not
treat
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
however
the
ibm
cpp
strips
the
comment
and
treats
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
the
cpp
fails
when
it
determines
that
this
is
not
a
known
directive
i
have
temporarily
hacked
my
imake
to
handle
this
situation
but
would
like
to
come
up
with
a
better
fix
several
imakefiles
use
as
a
parameter
to
a
macro
when
a
particular
use
of
the
macro
does
not
need
a
value
for
the
parameter
the
aix
cpp
gives
warnings
about
these
situations
but
continues
to
work
ok
if
you
are
familiar
with
these
problems
and
have
solutions
i
would
appreciate
information
about
on
your
solutions
perhaps
this
is
solved
in
a
later
version
of
imake
that
i
have
not
reviewed
also
do
you
know
of
other
cpps
that
behave
similarly
since
i
do
not
have
easy
access
to
news
a
response
to
would
be
appreciated
