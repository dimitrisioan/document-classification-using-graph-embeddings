xsetroot
xr
and
sparc
keyboard
hi
please
reply
to
me
direct
as
i
am
not
a
member
of
this
list
i
am
new
to
x
so
please
excuse
my
lax
read
probably
incorrect
terminology
environment
sun
sparc
sunos
xr
path
level
my
x
process
is
started
by
xdm
i
i
want
to
setup
the
backgroud
root
window
of
the
tvtwm
display
to
display
the
escherknot
etc
grey
is
a
very
boring
colour
to
work
on
the
setup
is
as
follows
libxxdmxsetup
xsetroot
bitmap
etc
userxsession
xsetroot
etc
tvtwm
there
are
also
tvtwmrc
and
xdefaults
files
in
the
user
home
directory
the
xsetroot
in
xsetup
displays
the
appropriate
bitmap
in
the
xdm
login
window
as
expected
very
nice
unfortunately
when
the
users
session
is
started
the
background
of
the
tvtwm
window
reverts
to
grey
if
i
manually
type
xsetroot
in
an
xterm
window
when
the
session
has
started
the
background
is
changed
as
expected
the
question
is
how
do
i
retain
the
background
from
the
login
window
andor
specify
a
new
background
on
a
peruser
basis
as
part
of
the
the
users
session
startup
ii
when
i
open
an
xterm
on
the
sparc
not
all
of
the
keys
are
recognised
and
some
keys
on
the
keyboard
are
not
sending
the
correct
characters
ie
real
key
key
shown
on
screen
hash
back
slash
tilde
pipe
double
quote
at
symbol
pound
hash
cursor
key
not
recognised
this
is
very
annoying
is
x
at
fault
here
or
the
machine
setup
i
have
installed
the
xterm
drivers
that
came
with
xr
in
both
terminfo
and
termcap
as
they
seemed
more
uptodate
typing
set
in
an
xterm
window
shows
a
terminal
type
of
xterm
as
expected
any
help
on
how
to
correct
either
of
these
problems
much
appreciated
thanks
