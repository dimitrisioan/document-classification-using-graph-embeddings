button
popup
menus
with
athena
widgets
ok
im
being
driven
batty
trying
to
create
popupmenus
ie
button
press
and
a
menu
appears
i
would
really
like
to
use
the
standard
athena
classes
to
achieve
this
goal
but
for
my
best
attempts
i
can
not
get
the
menus
to
come
up
without
using
a
menubutton
as
the
parent
of
the
widget
tree
i
know
this
should
be
possible
to
to
with
an
xtpopupspringloaded
and
a
little
twiddling
but
something
is
escaping
