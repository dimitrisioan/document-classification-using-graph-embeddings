status
ive
been
hearing
rumblings
about
fresco
and
it
sounds
like
it
may
be
what
im
looking
for
but
how
far
is
it
from
release
or
at
least
some
kind
of
availability
how
similar
is
it
to
interviews
if
i
code
to
interviews
will
my
code
work
with
fresco
how
about
motif
ive
heard
some
mention
of
versions
of
interviews
which
support
motif
will
it
be
feasible
to
use
motif
with
fresco
any
information
would
be
much
appreciated
