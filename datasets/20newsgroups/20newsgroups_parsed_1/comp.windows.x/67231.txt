hi
i
use
emacs
and
i
want
to
customize
my
keyboard
better
when
i
set
up
stuff
in
my
emacs
with
a
keymap
and
definekeys
i
can
only
access
certain
of
the
keys
on
my
xterminals
keyboard
i
cant
get
eg
f
home
end
pgup
pgdn
they
all
seem
to
have
either
the
same
or
no
keycode
i
have
a
feeling
this
cant
be
fixed
in
emacs
itself
but
that
i
need
to
do
some
xmodmap
stuff
can
someone
help
me
unfortunately
the
key
event
handling
is
pretty
much
hardwired
into
emacs
i
ran
into
this
problem
a
while
back
my
solution
was
to
change
the
source
code
so
that
all
of
these
special
keys
generated
character
sequences
which
basically
encoded
the
keysym
and
modifier
state
as
escape
sequences
for
example
the
sequence
esc
b
would
indicate
that
the
home
key
was
pressed
with
the
shift
key
down
you
could
also
detect
standard
keys
with
odd
modifiers
such
as
shiftreturn
if
anybody
wants
these
changes
theyre
welcome
to
them
but
youll
have
to
have
the
source
available
and
be
comfortable
munging
with
it
a
bit
basically
you
have
to
replace
the
keypress
handling
code
in
the
source
file
xtermc
maybe
if
someone
at
osf
is
interested
i
can
send
them
the
tweaks
but
i
imagine
theyve
got
bigger
fish
to
fry
hopefully
including
the
much
talked
about
emacs
v
if
theres
sufficient
interest
ill
post
the
mods
somewhere
although
this
probably
isnt
the
appropriate
group
for
it
notes
this
special
code
will
only
apply
if
you
let
emacs
create
its
own
x
window
if
you
run
it
in
plain
old
tty
mode
which
includes
xterm
windows
then
its
business
as
usual
the
patches
i
made
were
to
version
under
sun
os
i
also
did
this
a
while
back
under
hpux
the
patches
are
in
a
chunk
of
code
between
if
sun
endif
but
could
easily
be
adapted
for
anything
else
