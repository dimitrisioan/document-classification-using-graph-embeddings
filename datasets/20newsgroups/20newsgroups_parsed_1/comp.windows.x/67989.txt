trying
to
compile
xrpl

motif
on
a
hp
running
hpux
but
it
seems
to
be
not
very
succesful
because
i
have
only
hpcf
configfiles
for
hpux
i
tried
standard
cc
and
x
was
compiled
with
a
lot
of
warnings
the
motif
applications
are
compiled
quite
well
but
they
wont
run
i
receive
the
xkeysymdb
error
which
is
reported
in
faq
but
i
can
not
fix
it
the
xkeysymdbfile
is
at
the
right
location
and
it
works
fine
under
sunos
probably
i
have
started
the
compilation
prozess
only
with
a
wrong
configfile
please
help
me

in
advance
