problem
running
aix
info
from
a
sun
rlogin
shell
when
i
run
our
rss
info
utility
through
a
remote
login
shell
rlogin
from
my
sun
sparc
i
can
no
longer
type
lower
case
in
any
of
infos
window
prompts
i
thought
the
prob
may
have
been
due
to
my
sun
window
mgr
openlook
being
incompatible
with
the
aix
motif
application
but
i
tried
it
under
tvtwm
also
same
result
so
this
is
presumably
an
x
key
definition
problem
between
workstations
but
my
system
admins
feign
ignorance
what
do
i
need
to
do
the
be
able
to
type
lower
case
into
this
remote
aix
motif
app
from
within
my
local
openlook
