allocated
colors
can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
how
to
get
the
total
number
of
color
cells
allocated
in
the
default
colormap
eg
colormap
defaultcolormapmydisplay
myscreen
the
maximum
number
of
allocated
cells
is
given
by
defaultcellsmydisplay
myscreen
but
in
general
the
number
of
cells
actually
allocated
will
be
much
less
than
this
depending
on
the
color
requirements
of
the
windows
currently
in
place
id
like
a
way
to
determine
this
number
thanks
in
advance
