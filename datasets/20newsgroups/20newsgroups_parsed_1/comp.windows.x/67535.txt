is
it
reliable
how
does
it
send
the
information
from
a
ms
windows
app
over
the
x
protocol
does
it
just
draw
everything
as
graphics
into
one
window
or
does
it
use
multiple
windows
and
essentially
work
more
cleverly
if
i
want
to
run
ms

i
have
to
run
a
separate
copy
of

or
can

be
started
remotely
on
