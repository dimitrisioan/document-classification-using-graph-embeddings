reposting
th
international
obfuscated
c
code
contest
rules
of
we
have
received
a
number
of
requests
for
a
reposting
of
the
international
obfuscated
c
code
contest
rules
and
guidelines
also
some
people
requested
that
these
rules
be
posted
to
a
wider
set
of
groups
sorry
for
the
cross
posting
some
technical
clarifications
were
made
to
the
rules
and
guidelines
see
the
diff
marks
at
the
right
hand
edge
the
rules
and
guidelines
for
this
year
remain
the
same
so
people
who
have
already
or
are
in
the
process
of
submitting
entries
for
the
ioccc
need
not
worry
about
these
