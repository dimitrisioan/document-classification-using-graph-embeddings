we
are
the
ones
in
control
of
what
we
use
it
is
those
who
mark
follow
like
blind
sheep
which
cause
the
markets
to
skew
im
sure
mark
there
will
be
enough
paid
market
hipe
nt
conferences
without
it
mark
needing
to
be
in
what
was
once
a
conference
for
open
windowing
mark
enviroments
i
know
that
if
i
were
planning
to
go
i
would
cancel
mark
not
because
i
have
my
eyes
closed
but
because
nt
does
not
belong
mark
at
such
a
conference
i
would
however
like
to
go
to
a
closed
mark
environment
nt
conference
to
see
the
product
because
i
am
curious
mark
i
doubt
however
based
on
the
objective
opinions
of
those
i
trust
mark
that
i
would
be
impressed
why
do
many
people
believe
that
xhibition
is
one
of
the
paid
market
hype
nt
conferences
as
you
put
it
i
for
one
am
going
because
i
too
am
curious
about
the
technology
i
think
this
is
a
great
chance
to
learn
about
nt
mainly
because
it
will
be
presented
in
xs
home
turf
i
believe
that
the
attendees
will
mostly
have
x
backgrounds
biases
thus
i
expect
that
the
nt
presentations
will
face
a
tough
audience
i
can
be
there
in
person
to
judge
for
myself
whether
or
not
nt
is
what
it
is
hyped
to
be
this
is
as
closely
as
i
can
get
to
in
evaluating
the
nt
technology
without
actually
using
it
myself
which
i
dont
have
the
time
to
do
if
nt
turns
out
to
be
a
vapor
technology
and
i
get
bored
there
will
be
many
other
interesting
tutorialspresentations
that
i
wont
have
to
waste
my
time
in
california
just
my
thoughts
