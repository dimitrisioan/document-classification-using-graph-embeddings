writes
ow
is
the
same
but
the
definition
of
broken
is
relative
pageview
requires
dsc
compliant
postscript
files
in
order
to
stop
at
page
breaks
i
dont
consider
that
broken
i
say
that
any
program
that
puts
out
a
postscript
file
that
isnt
dsc
compliant
is
broken
well
that
may
be
true
however
the
man
page
for
pageview
for
ow
does
not
mention
about
dsc
compliance
in
any
event
the
point
here
is
that
if
you
try
to
display
some
ps
files
using
pageview
you
will
find
out
that
its
not
a
practical
tool
