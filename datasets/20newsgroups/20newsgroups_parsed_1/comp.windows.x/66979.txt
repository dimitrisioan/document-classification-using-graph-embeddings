cursor
forgive
me
if
this
is
a
faq
i
have
checked
the
list
but
i
cant
find
it
i
have
a
problem
with
the
cursor
within
xterm
on
mono
not
grayscale
monitors
the
problem
is
that
when
i
have
an
character
application
that
displays
input
fields
in
reverse
video
the
xterm
text
cursor
gets
lost
on
the
edge
of
the
input
field
the
solution
would
appear
to
be
to
set
the
xterm
cursor
to
a
line
rather
than
a
block
but
how
do
you
do
this
i
cant
find
any
means
although
various
sources
seem
to
indicate
it
can
be
done
when
the
xterm
loses
the
input
focus
the
cursor
becomes
an
outlined
block
this
would
also
be
preferable
but
i
cant
seem
to
force
this
to
be
the
default
either
configuration
is
motorola
k
xr

reply

you
