i
am
running
some
sample
problems
from
oreilly
volume
xt
intrisics
programming
manual
chapter
popup
dialog
boxes
and
so
on
in
example
page
creating
a
popup
dialog
box
the
application
creates
window
with
a
button
quit
and
press
me
the
button
press
me
pops
up
a
dialog
box
the
strange
feature
of
this
program
is
that
it
always
pops
up
the
dialog
box
much
faster
the
first
time
if
i
try
to
pop
it
up
a
nd
time
rd
th
time
it
is
much
slower
has
anyone
any
experience
with
these
sample
programs
or
why
i
get
this
behaviour
fast
response
time
for
the
first
time
but
slow
response
time
from
nd
time
onwards
anyone
can
give
me
some
ideas
on
how
to
program
popups
so
that
each
time
they
popup
in
reasonable
fast
response
time
thankyou
shirley
thanks
to
those
who
responded
we
were
able
to
prevent
this
behaviour
by
two
methods
running
twm
rather
than
olwm
keeping
olwm
but
putting
wmtimeout
in
the
resources
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
difficuty
was
something
to
do
with
the
window
manager
positioning
the
popup
window
any
guru
who
can
analyse
what
is
going
on
from
this
information
please
post
and
let
us
know
thanks
shirley
i
ran
in
to
this
problem
i
while
ago
and
from
what
i
remember
you
should
use
xttranslatecoordinates
etc
after
realizing
the
main
widget
to
calculate
the
location
of
the
popup
then
use
something
like
xtvasetvalues
on
the
popup
widgets
before
ever
using
them
calling
setvalues
repeatedly
eg
every
time
something
pops
up
seems
to
be
what
slows
you
down
i
never
delved
deep
enough
to
figure
out
exactly
why
though
