hi
im
new
to
this
group
so
please
bear
with
me
two
years
ago
i
wrote
a
sunview
application
for
fast
animation
of
raster
files
with
sunview
becoming
rapidly
obselete
ive
finally
decided
to
rewrite
everything
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
together
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimage
is
considerably
slower
factor
of
on
average
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
moves
image
data
from
memory
pixrects
to
a
canvas
this
was
on
a
sparc
ipx
it
seems
that
the
x
protocol
communication
is
slowing
things
down
or
xputimage
is
inefficientor
both
my
question
is
what
is
the
fastest
way
in
xr
to
dump
plane
image
data
to
a
window
can
i
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
client
is
running
on
the
same
machine
as
the
server
or
am
i
stuck
with
xputimage
in
which
case
i
might
as
well
give
up
now
all
help
appreciatedthanks
derek
the
fastest
way
is
to
use
an
x
server
with
shared
memory
extension
it
uses
shared
memory
if
it
is
a
local
x
server
hence
images
dont
have
to
be
duplicated
and
defaults
to
the
regular
image
routines
if
either
the
shared
mem
extension
is
not
available
or
if
its
not
the
localhost
