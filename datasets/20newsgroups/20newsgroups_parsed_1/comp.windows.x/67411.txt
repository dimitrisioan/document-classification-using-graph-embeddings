xv
has
finally
escaped
it
really
bums
me
out
that
xv
went
shareware
xv
is
shareware
for
personal
use
only
you
may
use
xv
for
your
own
what
does
this
mean
anyway
can
i
sit
in
a
company
and
look
at
pictures
off
the
net
in
my
spare
time
amusement
and
if
you
find
it
nifty
useful
generally
cool
or
of
some
value
to
you
your
nondeductable
donation
would
be
greatly
appreciated
is
the
suggested
donation
though
of
course
larger
donations
are
quite
welcome
folks
who
donate
or
more
can
receive
a
real
nice
bound
copy
of
the
xv
manual
for
no
extra
charge
commercial
government
and
institutional
users
must
register
their
copies
of
xv
for
the
exceedingly
reasonable
price
of
just
per
workstationx
terminal
site
licenses
are
available
for
those
who
wish
to
run
xv
on
a
large
number
of
machines
contact
the
author
for
more
details
now
since
universities
are
institutions
right
doesnt
this
mean
that
most
everyone
in
the
world
is
affected
by
this
i
dont
believe
there
are
that
many
running
x
windows
at
home
yet
relatively
speaking
can
the
author
legally
sell
xv
xv
uses
tiff
and
jpeg
code
developed
by
others
did
the
author
get
permission
to
sell
these
works
did
the
author
also
get
permission
from
all
the
people
who
contributed
to
xv
to
sell
their
work
as
well
my
guess
is
that
now
nobody
is
going
to
want
to
help
the
author
maintain
the
code
anymore
now
that
xv
has
become
a
commercial
product
and
support
for
xv
will
begin
to
slide
downhill
if
this
is
the
case
then
thats
a
bummer
i
really
liked
xv
