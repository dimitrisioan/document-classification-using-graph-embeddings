hierarchical

the

what
is
lowbandwidth
x
lbx
xremote
ppp
slip
cslip
there
are
several
options
for
using
x
over
serial
lines
slip
serial
line
ip
this
is
both
a
mechanism
and
a
protocol
for
sending
ip
packets
over
pointtopoint
serial
links
it
has
been
around
for
several
years
and
implementations
are
available
for
many
of
the
major
tcpip
implementations
most
x
terminal
vendors
supply
this
as
a
checkoff
item
although
nobody
really
ever
uses
it
since
it
is
horribly
slow
the
tcpip
headers
add
bytes
per
packet
and
the
tcpip
encoding
of
the
x
protocol
is
rather
verbose
rightfully
so
it
is
optimized
for
packing
and
unpacking
over
highspeed
links
cslip
compressed
header
slip
this
is
a
variant
of
slip
that
compresses
the
bytes
of
tcpip
headers
down
to
about
or
bytes
it
still
doesnt
do
anything
about
reencoding
the
x
protocol
modems
that
do
compression
can
help
but
they
increase
packet
latency
it
takes
time
to
dribble
the
uncompressed
data
through
typical
serial
interfaces
plus
the
compression
assembly
time
ppp
pointtopoint
protocol
this
is
an
emerging
standard
for
pointtopoint
links
over
serial
lines
that
has
a
more
complete
set
of
option
negotiation
than
slip
a
growing
number
of
people
see
the
combination
of
ppp
for
the
serial
line
management
and
cslip
for
the
header
compression
as
becoming
common
for
running
normal
tcpip
protocols
over
serial
lines
running
raw
x
over
the
wire
still
needs
compression
somewhere
to
make
it
usable
xremote
this
is
the
name
of
both
a
protocol
and
set
of
products
originally
developed
by
ncd
for
squeezing
the
x
protocol
over
serial
lines
in
addition
to
using
a
low
level
transport
mechanism
similar
to
pppcslip
xremote
removes
redundancies
in
the
x
protocol
by
sending
deltas
against
previous
packets
and
using
lzw
to
compress
the
entire
data
stream
this
work
is
done
by
either
a
pseudox
server
or
proxy
running
on
the
host
or
in
a
terminal
server
there
are
several
advantages
to
doing
compression
outside
the
modem
you
dont
have
to
have
compressing
modems
in
there
if
you
wouldnt
otherwise
be
using
them
eg
if
you
were
going
to
be
directly
connected
and
it
reduces
the
io
overhead
by
cutting
down
on
the
number
of
bytes
that
have
to
cross
the
serial
interface
and
in
addition
to
the
effects
of
it
reduces
the
latency
in
delivering
packets
by
not
requiring
the
modem
to
buffer
up
the
data
waiting
for
blocks
to
compress
lbx

x
this
is
an
x
consortium
project
that
is
working
on
a
standard
for
this
area
it
is
being
chaired
by
ncd
and
xerox
and
is
using
ncds
xremote
protocol
as
a
stepping
stone
in
developing
the
new
protocol
lbx
will
go
beyond
xremote
by
adding
proxy
caching
of
commonlyused
information
eg
connection
setup
data
large
window
properties
font
metrics
keymaps
etc
and
a
more
efficient
encoding
of
the
x
protocol
the
hope
is
to
have
a
standard
ready
for
public
review
in
the
first
half
of
next
year

why
does
my

exit
when
i
kill

sic
it
neednt
what
is
probably
happening
is
that
you
are
running
your
window
manager
as
the
last
job
in
your
xsession
or
xinitrc
file
your
x
session
runs
only
as
long
as
the
last
job
is
running
and
so
killing
your
window
manager
is
equivalent
to
logging
out
instead
run
the
window
manager
in
the
background
and
as
the
last
job
instead
invoke
something
safe
like
exec
xterm
name
login

or
any

you

subject
can

save

like
toolplaces
does
although
no
known
window
manager
directly
supports
such
a
feature

may
be
equivalent
to
writing
out
a
xinitrc
or
xsession
file
naming
the
geometry

wmcommand
of
each

but
olvwm
may
have
something
close
there

not
