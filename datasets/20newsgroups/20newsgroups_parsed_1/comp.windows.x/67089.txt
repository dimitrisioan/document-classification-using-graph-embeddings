xfree
and
esix
hello
netlanders
i
am
a
novice
x
user
with
a
question
for
any
xgod
my
computer
configuration
with
the
x
problem
is
as
follows
dxram
running
esix
wangtek
atstyle
interface
m
tape
drive
i
have
loaded
the
basic
os
which
includes
nsu
and
inet
utilities
tcpip
i
ftped
the
xfree
xr
binaries
and
installed
properly
i
can
execute
startx
and
run
xwindows
with
no
problems
however
if
i
try
to
access
the
tape
drive
while
in
x
the
machine
locks
up
instantly
if
i
am
out
of
x
and
access
the
tape
the
tape
drive
works
fine
soon
as
i
try
to
startx
again
the
screen
changes
modes
but
the
grey
background
pattern
does
not
come
up
and
no
xterm
is
forked
i
have
to
login
from
another
terminal
and
execute
a
shutdown
to
reset
the
system
ive
contacted
esix
about
this
problem
they
claim
their
xwindow
xr
server
which
i
have
works
with
the
wangtek
tape
drive
they
also
claim
i
only
need
the
nsu
network
system
utilities
to
run
x
i
dont
need
inet
tcpip
my
experience
has
been
that
i
need
both
to
get
xfree
to
work
im
not
too
concerned
about
having
to
load
both
nsu
and
inet
packages
to
get
x
to
work
unless
the
inet
package
is
causing
my
problem
i
would
like
to
get
both
x
and
my
tape
drive
to
coexist
on
the
same
system
if
you
can
shed
any
light
on
the
problem
it
would
be
appreciated
one
colleague
implied
this
might
be
a
hardware
conflict
if
this
is
true
what
direction
should
i
look
to
resolve
the
conflict
thanks
