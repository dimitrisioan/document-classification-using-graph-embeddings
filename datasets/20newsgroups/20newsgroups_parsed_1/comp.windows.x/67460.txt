colormap
problem
i
am
saving
an
image
on
one
machine
and
redisplaying
the
image
on
another
machine
both
are
hp
model
s
the
image
is
created
using
xcreateimage
and
xgetimage
and
displayed
with
xputimage
the
image
is
redisplayed
correctly
except
that
the
colors
are
wrong
because
the
server
on
the
other
machine
is
using
a
different
colormap
i
tried
saving
the
colormap
pixel
and
rgb
values
and
on
the
redisplay
performed
a
table
lookup
against
the
new
colormap
this
didnt
work
because
some
rgb
combos
dont
exist
in
the
new
colormap
is
there
a
way
to
force
the
server
to
load
colors
into
set
pixel
values
or
is
there
a
simpler
way
to
solve
this
problem
i
tried
using
xinitcolormap
but
couldnt
get
that
to
work
either
any
help
would
be
appreciated
