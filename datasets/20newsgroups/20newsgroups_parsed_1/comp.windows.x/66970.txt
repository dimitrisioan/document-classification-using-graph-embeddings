the
problem
occurs
during
the
initial
make
world
when
it
gets
up
to
compiling
the
standard
x
clients
it
cant
seem
to
find
some
of
the
libraries
right
now
we
highly
suspect
the
program
ld
which
was
updated
for
yip
we
had
the
same
problem
the
only
fix
we
found
was
to
link
static
some
of
the
clients
btw
we
used
cc
or
use
a
sunos
ld
