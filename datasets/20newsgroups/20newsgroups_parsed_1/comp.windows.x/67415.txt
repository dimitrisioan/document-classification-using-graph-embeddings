im
trying
to
create
a
button
that
has
both
a
label
and
a
bitmap
using
the
menubutton
widget
is
this
possible
right
now
all
i
get
is
the
bitmap
no
sign
of
the
label
thats
expected
the
first
sentence
describing
the
bitmap
resource
in
the
menubutton
section
of
the
athena
widget
set
c
language
interface
documentation
states
bitmap
a
bitmap
to
display
instead
of
the
label
one
way
round
this
might
be
to
make
use
of
the
buttons
backgroundpixmap
resource
but
remember
that
you
or
a
user
of
your
application
wont
be
able
to
set
it
from
a
resource
file
also
the
button
wont
automatically
be
the
size
of
the
bitmap
the
bitmap
will
be
tiled
if
necessary
or
you
could
set
the
buttons
dimensions
to
match
its
size
