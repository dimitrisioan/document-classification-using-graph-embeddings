also
mentioned
by
nick
kisseberth
looks
interesting
but
i
need
someone
to
point
me
to
some
documentation
is
this
method
likely
to
give
better
results
than
server
resident
pixmaps
id
also
be
interested
in
looking
at
the
xview
code
mentioned
above
theres
documentation
on
how
to
use
the
shared
memory
extension
in
the
xr
distribution
actually
i
just
finished
writing
a
motif
animation
program
takelotsofimagedataanddisplayitprettydarnfast
when
using
onserver
pixmaps
or
shared
memory
i
had
to
insert
a
delay
loop
to
keep
it
from
going
too
quickly
testing
both
methods
side
by
side
they
were
just
about
equal
the
advantage
of
shm
is
that
your
x
server
doesnt
grow
to
ridiculous
sizes
but
pixmaps
can
work
over
a
network
and
are
removed
if
your
application
dies
one
tends
to
use
ipcrm
manually
quite
a
bit
when
debugging
shm
apps
shared
memory
also
has
the
problem
that
some
operating
systems
eg
ultrix
seem
to
allow
only
a
small
number
of
segments
to
be
attached
to
a
process
at
once
consequently
a
redraw
becomes
xshmattachxshmputimagexshmdetach
on
dec
systems
and
decs
bit
displays
like
the
ones
i
tend
to
use
most
often
dont
seem
to
support
the
extension
maybe
someone
compiled
them
wrong
and
using
pixmaps
causes
the
x
server
to
crash
failed
mallocs
so
one
has
to
use
the
local
unix
domain
socket
which
really
isnt
that
bad
one
copies
the
info
three
times
per
redraw
instead
of
one
in
short
allowing
all
three
forms
of
display
within
the
program
is
a
good
thing
minus
shm
if
running
over
a
network
and
let
the
user
pick
whatever
feels
fastest
i
just
use
an
ximagehandler
class
and
forget
about
it
