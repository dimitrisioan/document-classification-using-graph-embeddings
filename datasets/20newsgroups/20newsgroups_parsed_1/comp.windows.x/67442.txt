re
how
to
mask
the
left
button
one
way
to
mask
the
left
button
check
the
contents
of
the
xevent
that
the
xaddeventhandler
send
to
your
eventhandling
function
in
your
case
it
is
the
showmouseposition
function
if
the
xevent
arrive
in
this
function
as
xevent
pevent
then
the
value
of
peventxbuttonbutton
is
the
button
that
was
pressed
so
you
just
do
a
switch
on
that
value
in
order
to
distinguish
between
them
in
case
it
was
not
clear
peventxeventbutton
is
an
int
by
the
way
you
mentioned
the
buttonmotionmask
and
if
anyone
can
help
me
with
these
motionmasks
i
would
be
grateful
i
can
not
figure
out
how
do
distinguish
between
motions
by
which
button
is
pressed
as
the
motion
is
occurring
in
essence
i
would
like
an
seperate
eventhandler
for
motion
with
each
button
unfortunately
the
xevent
sent
by
a
motionmask
does
not
seem
to
contain
the
value
of
the
pressed
button
any
ideas
