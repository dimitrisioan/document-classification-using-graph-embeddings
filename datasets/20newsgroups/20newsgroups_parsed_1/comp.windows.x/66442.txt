theres
a
bug
in
sunos
which
is
alluded
to
in
the
faq
although
there
its
talking
about
xr
as
being
affected
you
need
to
force
libxmu
to
be
linked
statically
rather
than
dynamically
which
works
around
the
linker
error
the
simplest
thing
to
do
is
edit
each
of
the
makefiles
where
theres
a
failure
and
change
the
line
which
reads
xmulib
lxmusrc
lxmu
to
xmulib
lxmusrc
bstatic
lxmu
bdynamic
no
this
is
only
relevant
for
openwindows
x
as
shipped
with
sunos
it
is
not
relevant
for
mit
r

i
dont
know
how
many
hours
youve
spent
on
this
but

sun
user
group

sug
cd
is
xr
and
gnu
on
a
cdrom
priced
at
to
sug
members
including
a
caddy
sugs
emphasis
has
always
been
on
supplying
the
greatest
possible
service
and
valueadded
to
our
members
last
year
the
sug
disk
contained
plugandplay
xr
mb
of
additional
essential
binaries
almost
mb
of
sun
patches
fullyindexed
archives
of
sunrelated
net
postings
priced
at
only
our
aim
this
year
has
been
to
reduce
the
price
for
disks
which
can
be
produced
inexpensively
but
to
continue
to
supply
as
much
valueadded
as
possible
to
accomplish
this
we
will
be
putting
out
a
two
disk
set
the
first
containing
whats
ready
and
needed
now
the
second
available
later
in
containing
more
sparc
binaries
and
other
useful
material
not
found
on
previous
disks
the
sug
disk
which
was
assembled
by
robert
a
bruce
contains
a
lot
of
essential
source
code
and
we
decided
it
would
be
a
great
service
to
make
it
available
right
away
to
our
members
and
this
pricing
makes
this
a
good
opportunity
to
become
a
member
for

including
one
of
those
hardtofind

if
you
are
not

you

you

means
it
can

including
