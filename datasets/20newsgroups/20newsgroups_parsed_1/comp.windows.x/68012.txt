hi
all
this
is
the
first
time
ive
posted
to
the
net
so
i
hope
this
is
going
to
the
right
people
im
looking
for
software
packages
that
run
on
an
ibm
pc
clone
that
allows
me
to
display
openlook
and
motif
windows
on
the
pc
the
idea
is
to
use
the
pc
as
a
cheap
x
windows
terminal
for
use
by
process
engineers
at
work
heres
a
listing
that
i
came
accross
a
while
ago
this
question
seems
to
come
up
often
enough
that
i
figured
this
would
be
of
interest
note
that
the
server
x
appeal
for
dos
is
available
in
demo
form
on
the
internet
via
anonymous
ftp
this
is
one
way
of
quickly
checking
out
the
feasability
of
using
your
system
as
an
x
server
