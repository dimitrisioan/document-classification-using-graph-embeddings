how
can
i
use
xv
to
display
colored
gifs
on
my
jan
root
display
with
hp
vue
jan
all
i
can
do
with
vue
is
display
xbms
through
their
jan
backdrop
style
manager
jan
xv
does
not
seem
to
be
able
to
override
whatever
vue
jan
puts
there
i
suspect
this
is
because
vue
creates
a
window
probably
overrideredirect
that
is
the
size
of
or
larger
than
the
root
window
because
the
window
manager
does
not
know
about
this
you
can
not
move
resize
etc
it
xv
in
the
mean
time
is
busy
changing
your
root
window
to
whatever
you
have
requested
but
you
never
get
to
see
it
because
vues
window
is
overlaid
on
top
of
the
root
window
contact
hp
support
and
see
whether
vue
can
support
coloured
bitmap
format
such
as
xpm
if
they
cant
then
they
probably
create
all
their
coloured
backdrops
inside
the
code
