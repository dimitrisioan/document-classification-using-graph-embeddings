xtaddeventhandler
dear
xperts
im
developing
an
application
that
uses
a
motif
slider
to
select
an
image
file
out
of
a
directory
now
i
would
like
to
display
the
name
of
the
file
corresponding
to
the
value
of
the
dragged
scale
button
ie
with
the
mb
pressed
as
xmnshowvalue
only
displays
the
current
value
of
the
scale
button
and
not
the
actual
corresponding
image
file
name
i
thought
of
using
an
xtaddeventhandler
to
do
the
mapping
between
the
scale
value
and
the
file
name
xtaddeventhandlerscaleimagebuttonmotionmask
false
slidermoved
null
and
in
the
eventhandler
do
a
while
xchecktypedwindowevent
display
eventwindow
motionnotify
return
xmscalegetvaluescaleimagevalue
map
value
to
file
entry
in
directory
and
finally
obtain
file
name
to
open
however
when
i
move
the
pointer
in
the
scale
widget
i
get
callbacks
with
of
co
urse
a
null
effect
as
my
mb
is
not
pressed
to
move
the
scale
button
so
what
is
goin
g
wrong
or
is
the
a
wrong
approach
to
this
problem
any
hints
are
highly
appreciated
