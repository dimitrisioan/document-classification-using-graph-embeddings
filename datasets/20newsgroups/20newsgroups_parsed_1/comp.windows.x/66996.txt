how
writes
a
problem
occurs
when
i
try
to
create
a
window
with
a
visual
that
is
different
from
the
visual
of
the
parent
which
uses
the
default
visual
which
is
tc
youve
got
to
set
borderpixel
in
your
window
attributes
the
default
is
copyfromparent
which
gives
the
badmatch
do
this
unsigned
long
valuemask
if
borderwidth
is
nonzero
youd
better
alloc
a
colour
from
cmap
rather
than
use
any
old
pixel
value
also
use
valuemask
it
makes
the
code
more
obvious

borderwidth
set
to
copyfromparent
works
but
doesnt
make
sense
borderwidth
should
be
an
unsigned
int
you
get
away
with
it
because
copyfromparent
is
defineed
to
be
zero
in
xh
if
it
happened
to
be
defined
as
youd
get
a
very
interesting
looking
window
