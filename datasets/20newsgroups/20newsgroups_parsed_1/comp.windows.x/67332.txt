sun
xr
undeletable
console
messages
we
have
an
old
sun
here
which
gets
occasional
use
when
xr
is
started
on
it
any
console
messages
during
startup
are
undeletable
after
x
is
fully
started
we
run
an
xterm
as
the
console
the
problem
is
that
any
messages
that
arrive
before
this
starts
go
to
the
plain
console
refresh
window
fails
to
remove
them
the
messages
are
a
real
pain
since
they
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
screen
obscuring
anything
else
below
them
at
boot
time
the
lists
two
framebuffers
devcgfour
and
devbwtwo
were
running
x
in
color
and
i
suspect
that
maybe
the
offending
messages
are
on
the
bw
framebuffer
and
thereby
not
getting
deleted
my
question
is
has
anyone
else
seen
this
and
is
there
an
easy
way
to
get
rid
of
these
messages
please
reply
by
email

btw
sunos

mwm
ps
i
know
i
can
redirect
output
of
the
relevant
commands
to
devnull
im
looking
for
a
more
general
solution
