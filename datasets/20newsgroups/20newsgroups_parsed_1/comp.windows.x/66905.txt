re
expose
events
i
posted
about
this
a
while
ago
but
without
code
excerpts
noone
was
able
to
help
me
the
problem
is
that
mainwinwin
is
doing
fine
but
when
i
create
detailwinwin
it
does
not
receive
its
initial
expose
events
until
mainwinwin
receives
an
event
here
are
the
relevent
calls
mainwinwin
xcreatesimplewindow
mydisplay
defaultrootwindowmydisplay
myhintx
myhinty
myhintwidth
myhintheight
mainwinlinethick
fg
bg
xsetstandardpropertiesmydisplay
mainwinwin
mainwintext
mainwintext
none
argv
argc
myhint
mainwingc
xcreategc
mydisplay
mainwinwin
xmapraised
mydisplay
detailwinwin
xmapsubwindows
mydisplay
mainwinwin
the
event
mask
for
mainwin
is
pposition
psize
structurenotifymask
exposuremask
keypressmask
enterwindowmask
leavewindowmask
the
flags
are
pposition
psize
i
then
create
detailwinwin
with
the
following
calls
hints
has
new
values
detailwinwin
xcreatesimplewindow
mydisplay
defaultrootwindowmydisplay
myhintx
myhinty
myhintwidth
myhintheight
detailwinlinethick
fg
bg
xsetstandardpropertiesmydisplay
mainwinwin
detailwintext
detailwintext
none
argv
argc
myhint
detailwingc
xcreategc
mydisplay
detailwinwin
xmapraised
mydisplay
detailwinwin
event
mask
and
flags
are
identical
to
mainwins
flags
and
event
mask
if
anybody
has
any
idea
why
the
initial
expose
events
of
detailwinwin
are
not
received
until
mainwinwin
receives
an
event
id
love
to
hear
from
them
other
that
that
everything
works
great
so
there
must
be
some
detail
im
overseeing
thanks
for
any
tips
