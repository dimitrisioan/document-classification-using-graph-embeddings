but
your
performance
will
suck
lemons
running
an
xserver
on
a
clone
from
experience
you
would
be
much
better
off
with
an
xterminal
if
this
is
a
new
install
the
performance
will
be
at
least
four
times
better
in
addition
it
would
be
much
easier
to
install
and
use
on
top
of
that
they
will
cost
about
the
same
price
a
clone
with
mb
ram
ethernet
card
very
high
performance
graphics
card
good
monitor
server
software
tcpip
for
clone
software
mouse
keyboard

you
spend
a
whole
lot
of
i
can
get
tektronix
xp
terminals
for
under
and
the
performance
is
over

i
think
your
performance
will
depend
upon
the
x
server
im
running
linux
and
xfree
on
a
mhz
dx
with
mb
of
ram
mb
swap
and
it
runs
just
fine
its
a
lot
better
than
some
of
the
crappy
old
xterminals
in
the
labs
at
school
anyway
you
could
probably
outfit
a
sx
with
a
minimal
linuxx
setup
for
and
be
better
off
than
with
an
xterminal
