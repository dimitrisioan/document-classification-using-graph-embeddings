i
wonder
if
anybody
know
of
a
xwindowbased
postscript
file
viewer
that
runs
under
sunos
prefered
hpux
or
ibm
aix
if
you
are
running
sun
openwindows
you
can
use
pageview
this
is
an
x
window
postscript
previewer
like
ghostview
but
displays
much
nicer
yes
but
its
broken
on
ow
it
does
not
handle
multiple
pages
well
if
you
dont
have
the
proper
postscript
commands
it
will
draw
the
entire
document
on
the
same
page
instead
of
pausing
after
each
page
i
havent
tried
ow
yet
though
ow
is
the
same
but
the
definition
of
broken
is
relative
pageview
requires
dsc
compliant
postscript
files
in
order
to
stop
at
page
breaks
i
dont
consider
that
broken
i
say
that
any
program
that
puts
out
a
postscript
file
that
isnt
dsc
compliant
is
broken
