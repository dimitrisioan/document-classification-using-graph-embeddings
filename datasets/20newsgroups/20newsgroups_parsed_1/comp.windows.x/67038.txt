actually
i
must
also
ask
the
faqs
most
popular
reason
why
graphics
dont
show
up
do
you
wait
for
an
expose
event
before
drawing
your
rectangle
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
expose
event
handler
take
care
of
rendering
the
image
because
at
that
time
it
is
guaranteed
that
the
window
is
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
visible
and
mapped
do
you
know
the
best
way
to
tickle
a
window
so
that
the
expose
event
handler
will
be
invoked
to
draw
this
new
item
i
specifically
made
the
above
comment
assuming
that
perhaps
the
code
fragment
came
from
a
simple
opendrawquit
client
as
per
your
question
why
not
have
the
button
handler
add
the
object
and
then
call
the
windowredraw
or
whatever
directly
although
depending
on
how
the
overall
application
is
structured
there
may
be
no
problem
with
rendering
the
object
directly
in
response
to
the
button
press
