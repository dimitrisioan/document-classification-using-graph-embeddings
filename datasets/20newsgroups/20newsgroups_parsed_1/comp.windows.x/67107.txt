is
there
a
possibility
to
determine
via
x
protocol
calls
the
size
of
free
memory
available
to
the
xserver
no
even
if
you
could
the
answer
could
be
out
of
date
even
before
you
get
it
even
if
you
grab
the
server
it
could
be
taken
up
by
buffering
user
actions
you
should
just
try
to
do
whatever
you
want
a
badalloc
error
is
your
indication
that
insufficient
server
memory
is
available
der
mouse
this
isnt
of
much
help
especially
when
doing
phigs
pex
via
the
libphigs
as
supplied
by

have
much
trouble
together
