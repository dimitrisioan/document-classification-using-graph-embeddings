hint
for
sun
os
users
use
usrbinecho
instead
of
binecho
or
cshs
builtin
echo
otherwise
youll
have
to
embed
literal
esc
and
bel
characters
in
the
string
instead
of
using
convenient
octal
sequences
bad
idea
using
usrbinecho
is
slower
than
the
builtin
echo
this
is
what
i
do
it
does
execute
hostname
once
per
shell
window
and
does
read
in
one
extra
file
but
manipluating
the
titles
does
not
require
executing
extra
programs
oh
yes
it
does
execute
some
programs
once
per
each
system
but
it
stores
them
in
a
file
for
the
next
time
if
hostname
then
setenv
hostname
hostname
endif
figure
how
how
to
generate
escape
bell
and
echo
commands
without
a
a
line
terminator
i
may
have
done
this
before
if
so
the
variable
e
is
set
have
i
executed
this
script
before
on
this
system
if
e
then
echo
already
set
the
echo
variablesdevtty
else
if
f
echohostname
then
source
echohostname
else
if
echo
n
wc
l
then
echo
built
in
echo
is
bsd
devtty
then
berkeley
style
echo
echo
set
ech
echo
n
echohostname
echo
set
e
echo
a
tr
a
echohostname
echo
set
b
echo
a
tr
a
echohostname
echo
set
n
echohostname
source
echohostname
else
echo
built

echo
is
sysv
devtty
echo
set
ech
echo
echohostname
echo
set
e
echohostname
echo
set
b
echohostname
echo
set
n
c
echohostname
source
echohostname
endif
are
we
using
shelltool
cmdtool
or
xterm
duplicate
these
aliases
here
to
avoid
problems
if
term
sun
then
sun
aliases
alias
header
ech
elen
alias
iheader
ech
elen
else
if
term
xterm
then
alias
header
ech
ebn

ech
ebn
endif
