geometry
in
font
units
in
place
of
pixels
i
am
planning
to
convert
my
motif
app
from
pixel
to
font
units
which
would
all
be
set
in
the
apps
resource
file
instead
of
hard
coded
in
the
program
however
the
word
here
is
from
people
who
tried
this
already
that
for
some
unknown
reason
xmform
offsets
placed
in
the
resource
file
are
still
interpreted
in
pixel
units
forcing
people
to
code
those
offset
font
units
into
the
program
can
somebody
confirm
this
thanks
