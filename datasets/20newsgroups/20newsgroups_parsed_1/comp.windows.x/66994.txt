using
a
dialog

need
to
set
callbacks
from
the
buttonswidgets
in
your
dialog
and
let
the
callback
routines
do
the
work
in
the
callbacks
you
can
then
carry
on

a
notify
box
which
can
return
a
status

actualy
ease
coding

goes

event
driven
style
of
an
application

delta
hedging
a
long

return
generated
from
delta
hedging
options
can
be
thought
of
as
compensation
for
assuming
