so
then
its
up
to
the
individual
to
make
the
choice
whether
or
not
to
honour
it
and
part
with
money
personally
if
i
was
in
his
position
i
would
do
exactly
the
same
thing
john
has
obviously
put
in
lot
of
time
and
effort
into
xv
and
why
shouldnt
he
receive
some
money
for
it
just
my
pennies
worth
keep
up
the
good
work
john
the
fee
is
a
suggestion
for
an
individual
but
licensing
is
mandatory
for
commercial
government
and
institutional
users
