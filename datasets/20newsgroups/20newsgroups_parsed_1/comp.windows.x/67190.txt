re
postscript
on
xterminal
i
have
a
problem
when
im
using
postscript
when
i
am
working
local
on
a
sun
sparcstation
ipc
the
postscript
works
good
but
when
i
connect
to
the
sun
from
a
xterminal
i
just
get
error
messages
that
the
postscript
can
not
connect
to
the
newsdisplay
why
doesnt
postscript
work
on
an
xterminal
because
xterminals
do
not
have
a
news
server
xterminals
have
speed
by
nature
of
their
limited
functionality
once
you
add
news
and
everything
else
you
have
a
workstation
there
are
workarounds
ive
heard
one
involving
a
perl
script
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
replace
programs
that
need
news
like
pageview
with
programs
that
dont
like
ghostview
maybe
someone
else
can
elaborate
on
the
perl
workaround
i
have
no
personal
experience
with
it

if
you
dont
like
this
policy
disconnect
now
