subject
re
xv
has
escaped
given
that
all
the
source
code
contains
explicit
permission
to
use
or
modify
the
code
without
fee
in
addition
to
the
shareware
notice
i
would
say
that
the
shareware
notice
is
unenforceable
all
you
need
to
do
is
make
minor
changes
to
create
a
derivative
work
which
is
explicitly
allowed
under
the
first
part
of
the
copyright
notice
of
course
this
would
be
circumventing
the
authors
wishes
on
the
subject
but
id
say
if
youre
not
going
to
pay
him
no
matter
what
youd
be
on
relatively
safe
ground
with
that
approach
in
fact
given
the
internal
contradictions
of
the
copyright
notices
id
guess
none
of
it
could
ever
be
enforced
but
not
being
a
lawyer
i
cant
be
positive
regardless
the
fees
hes
asking
are
not
excessive
and
i
would
encourage
anyone
who
wants
to
use
the
program
to
pay
them
if
at
all
possible
even
though
it
is
unlikely
that
you
have
actual
legal
obligations
to
pay
the
author
it
would
be
reasonable
to
do
so
to
support
his
efforts
if
nothing
else
brad
brad
daniels
if
money
cant
buy
happiness
i
guess
ill
have
to
rent
it
i
dont
work
for
neosoft
and
weird
al

dont
speak
for
my
employer
