the
application
creates
window
with
a
button
quit
and
press
me
the
button
press
me
pops
up
a
dialog
box
the
strange
feature
of
this
program
is
that
it
always
pops
up
the
dialog
box
much
faster
the
first
time
if
i
try
to
pop
it
up
a
nd
time
rd
th
time
it
is
much
slower
the
shell
is
waiting
for
the
windowmanager
to
respond
to
its
positioning
request
the
windowmanager
is
not
responding
because
it
thinks
the
window
is
already
in
the
right
place
exactly
why
the
two
components
get
into
this
sulk
is
unclear
to
me
all
information
greatly
received
the
only
time
ive
seen
similar
behaviour
is
when
an
x
application
forked
a
child
without
setting
close
on
exec
on
the
x
display
connection
file
descriptor
the
shell
waited
for
a
configurenotify
event
that
never
arrived
because
it
got
picked
up
by
the
child
sometimes
the
shell
correctly
got
the
configurenotify
if
the
timing
was
right
