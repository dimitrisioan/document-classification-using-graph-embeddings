is
the
first
time
ive
posted
to
the
net
so
i
hope
this
is
going
to
the
right
people
im
looking
for
software
packages
that
run
on
an
ibm
pc
clone
that
allows
me
to
display
openlook
and
motif
windows
on
the
pc
the
idea
is
to
use
the
pc
as
a
cheap
x
windows
terminal
for
use
by
process
engineers
at
work
may
i
humbly
suggest

are
converted
