article

i
am
reposting
this
because
i
am
not
sure
my
first
post
ever
made
it
out
i
have
built
and
installed
xr
on
my
sparcstation
my
aim
is
to
run
the
mit
x
server
but
retain
the
openlook
window
manager
i
am
sure
this
is
not
uncommon
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
change
andor
delete
everything
that
i
need
to
for
instance
i
can
start
xdm
in
rclocal
but
how
do
i
get
rid
of
xnews
the
openlook
window
manager
source
is
available
on
the
mit
contrib
tapes
or
from
exportlcsmitedu
i
would
suggest
building
this
too
rather
than
using
the
version
from
openwindows
it
is
olwm
