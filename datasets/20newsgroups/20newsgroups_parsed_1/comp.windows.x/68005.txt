piping
tail
f
to
a
widget
how
oh
lord
how
ive
spent
the
past
week
tearing
my
hair
out
trying
to
get
the
output
of
a
piped
tail
f
to
end
up
in
a
widget
ive
managed
to
make
it
work
in
some
ugly
ways
but
either
a
x
blocks
on
the
tail
and
wont
allow
user
input
b
the
tail
f
functions
like
just
tail
and
doesnt
follow
the
expansion
of
the
file
c
the
tail
f
doesnt
die
after
ive
closed
the
pipe
and
destoryed
the
widget
or
d
pclose
blocks
forever
waiting
for
tail
to
die
i
know
this
code
has
to
exist
anybody
have
it
a
general
popen
case
would
be
perfered
but
at
this
point
ill
take
anything
thanks
