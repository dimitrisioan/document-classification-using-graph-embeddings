i
use
desqviewx
and
i
think
it
is
great
where
it
really
shines
imho
is
to
let
unix
users
log
into
a
pc
and
run
dos
and
windows
applications
with
the
display
going
to
their
screens
youll
need
to
get
desqviewx
v
desqviewx

desqviewx
to
other
x
systems
v
suggested
retail
you
also
must
be
running
a
supported
network
ftp
softwares
pctcp
novell
lan
workplace
for
dos
sun
microsystems
pcnfs
beame
and
whiteside
wollongong
pathway
tcpip
or
hp
microsoft
lan
manager
if
you
dont
have
any
of
this
network
stuff
quarterdeck
will
give
you
a
copy
of
novell
tcpip
transprot
for
dos
with
the
network
manager
you
can
get
more
info
by
sending
email
to
appropriately
actually
is
our
customer
service
department
if
you
have
technical
questions
you
can
write
to
in
my
opinion
if
you
want
to
have
other
people
logging
in
and
running
applications
at
your
pc
youll
want
to
have
a
with
megs
of
ram
also
the
xwindows
software
in
desqviewx
really
seems
to
like
an
et
tseng
labs
chipset
based
graphics
card
personally
i
found
that
things
ran
better
with
a
scsi
drive
in
the
pc
than
with
esdi
drives
but
that
is
my
experience
only
what
sort
of
traffic
is
generated
with
the
xcalls
i
am
curious
to
find
out
the
required
bandwidth
that
a
link
must
have
if
one
machine
running
dvx
is
supporting
multiple
users
clients
and
we
require
adequate
response
time
anyone
have
any
ideas
i
expect
the
limiting
factor
will
be
your
server
machine
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
example
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughly
people
using
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
boxes
novell
file
servers
and
each
other
its
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
maybe
concentrators
so
you
have
people
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badly
loaded
net
or
the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some
slowdowns
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machine
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
working
programs
running
youll
know
it
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given
machine
before
you
started
seeing
slowdowns
again
this
time
from
network
bandwidth
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the
programs
are
doing
ie
youre
going
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
apps
are
all
doing
network
