i
have
the
following
problem
on
xr
servers
when
a
window
of
my
is
obscured
by
a
pop
up
window
which
has
the
save
under
attribute
set
the
subwindows
of
my
window
are
not
restored
normally
the
subwindows
are
redrawn
when
the
parent
window
gets
an
expose
event
but
because
the
save
under
attribute
is
used
for
the
pop
up
window
that
obscured
my
window
no
expose
event
is
sent
we
had
the
same
problem
and
on
most
of
our
machines
it
works
if
we
use
backing
store
instead
of
