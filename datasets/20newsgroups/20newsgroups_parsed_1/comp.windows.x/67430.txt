click
to
focus
vs
point
to
focus
i
am
having
the
problem
of
ensuring
pointtofocus
when
the
mouse
cursor
enters
a
window
in
my
application
im
using
interviews
but
that
may
not
matter
this
seems
to
be
a
generic
problem
in
x
for
example
i
use
openwindows
on
a
sparc
with
pointtofocus
set
and
that
generally
works
but
not
always
depending
on
what
was
going
on
in
some
window
when
i
move
the
cursor
from
one
shell
tool
window
to
another
or
so
it
seems
my
question
then
is
what
can
i
do
within
x
to
guarantee
pointto
focus
within
my
application
thanks
for
any
response
dave
