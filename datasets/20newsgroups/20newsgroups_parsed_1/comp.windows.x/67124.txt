calling
a
library
which
creates
widgets
multiple
times
a
few
days
ago
i
posted
a
question
about
trying
to
call
a
function
which
set
up
an
x
app
multiple
times
it
was
pointed
out
that
xtappinitialize
should
never
be
called
more
than
once
this
helped
however
i
am
still
having
some
problems
below
is
a
new
little
test
program
that
more
closely
models
my
real
program
in
the
actual
program
i
am
writing
a
library
callable
from
any
other
program
this
means
that
the
first
time
the
lib
function
is
called
it
must
initialize
things
and
after
that
it
should
just
use
the
old
stuff
still
around
because
of
static
variables
in
the
demo
below
main
represents
the
main
program
calling
my
library
and
doit
represents
the
interface
to
the
library
function
