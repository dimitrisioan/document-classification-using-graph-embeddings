is
plain
postscript
it
is
only
wrapped

and
stripped

compatibility
you
can
simply
do
save
gsave
showpage
def
include
eps
file
here
grestore
restore
showpage
end
of

show
it

its
natural
page
position
and
size
programs
may
use
the
boundingbox
comment
in
the
eps
file
to
do
arbitrary
scale
rotate
and
translate
to
include
it
in
more
complicated
ways
