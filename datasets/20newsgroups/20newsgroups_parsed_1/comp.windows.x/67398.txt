from
martin
visser
ive
found
a
problem
in
the
use
of
xlib
functions
regarding
reentrancy
i
decided
to
implement
an
animated
cursor
using
created
cursors
by
calling
xdefinecursor
from
a
sigalrm
signal
handler
this
is
used
to
indicate
we
are
waiting
for
a
operator
request
to
complete
on
a
production
control
system
i
was
redrawing
the
screen
underneath
the
animated
cursor
and
then
restoring
the
standard
cursor
when
complete
i
found
dumped
core
and
upon
analysis
it
was
when
the
sigalrm
handler
was
called
during
a
xdrawstring
call
xdrawstring
was
doing
a
bcopy
presumably
an
internal
structure
when
the
xdefinecursor
was
called
presumably
the
internal
structure
that
xdrawstring
was
manipulating
was
not
in
a
stable
state
and
sent
xdefinecursor
to
where
it
shouldnt
have
been
has
anyone
else
experienced
this
is
there
any
official
documentation
that
says
you
should
ensure
this
doesnt
happen
or
should
bcopy
be
atomic
we
are
running
on
sgi
irix
with
xr
