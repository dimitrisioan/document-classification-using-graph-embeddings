said
i
am
developing
an
x
xtxm
application
that
will
include
a
graphics
window
of
some
sort
with
moving
symbols
among
other
things
a
pure
x
application
could
be
implemented
with
motif
widgets
one
of
which
would
be
an
xmdrawingarea
for
drawing
with
xlib
but
i
would
like
to
take
advantage
of
the
graphics
library
gl
available
on
our
ibm
rs
sgis
gl
i
believe
is
it
possible
to
mix
x
and
gl
in
one
application
program
can
i
use
gl
subroutines
in
an
xmdrawingarea
or
in
an
x
window
opened
by
me
with
xopenwindow
in
sgis
distribution
with
their
indigo
line
others
as
well
possibly
they
include
source
code
for
a
gl
widget
that
fits
on
top
of
motif
and
one
thats
xt
based
as
well
you
may
wish
to
ask
ibm
whether
they
support
this
