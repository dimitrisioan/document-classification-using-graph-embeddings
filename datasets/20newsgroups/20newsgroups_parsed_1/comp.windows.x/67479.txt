subject
action
translation
table
implementation
hello
our
application
requires
us
to
capture
keypad
presses
for
all
windows
in
a
number
of
applications
we
are
trying
to
use
action
translation
tables
to
implement
this
we
have
only
succeeded
by
assigning
the
translation
table
to
every
individual
widget
in
all
windows
in
a
single
application
the
xt
calls
we
make
are
included
below
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
if
we
could
assign
the
translation
table
to
a
class
of
widgets
rather
than
individual
widget
instantiations
and
also
accomplish
it
for
multiple
applications
if
someone
could
describe
how
do
this
it
would
be
greatly
appreciated
