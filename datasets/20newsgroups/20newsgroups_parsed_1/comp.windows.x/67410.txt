help
in
developing
a
xwindows
interface
for
gdb
hi
i
am
trying
to
write
an
xwindows
based
interface
that
runs
on
top
of
gdb
could
anyone
help
me
in
understanding
the
way
we
are
supposed
to
fork
gdb
off
as
a
subprocess
i
currently
use
pipes
but
when
i
try
and
debug
this
program
the
following
happens
program
main
int
x
printfenter
x
scanfd
x
printfx
dn
x
output
the
program
hangs
without
returning
the
output
of
the
printf
statement
when
i
type
in
a
value
like
then
all
the
printfs
output
comes
out
at
one
time
is
there
any
other
way
besides
using
pipes
to
do
this
ie
like
ioctl
or
something
else
