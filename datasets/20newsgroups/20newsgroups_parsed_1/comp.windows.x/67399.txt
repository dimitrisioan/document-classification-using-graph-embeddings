writes
as
i
announced
at
the
x
technical
conference
in
january
i
would
like
to
make
imaketex
the
imake
support
for
using
the
tex
typesetting
system
publically
available
currently
imaketex
is
in
beta
test
here
at
the
computer
science
department
of
dortmund
university
and
i
am
looking
for
some
more
beta
testers
preferably
with
different
tex
and
imake
installations
judging
from
the
responses
so
far
i
have
not
made
clear
enough
in
my
article
quoted
above
that
imaketex
is
not
for
installing
tex
but
for
using
it
with
imaketex
you
will
never
again
have
to
fiddle
around
with
calling
latex
and
its
various
utility
programs
makeindex
bibtex
simply
type
make
and
your
documents
dvi
file
will
be
uptodate
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
write
a
simple
imakefile
and
let
imake
generate
a
suitable
makefile
for
you
here
is
such
an
imakefile
include
textmpl
paperformata
simplelatextargetdocument
the
generated
makefile
provides
the
following
commands
make
depend
searching
the
tex
source
files
for
dependencies
like
inputsomefile
make
dvi
generate
an
uptodate
dvi
file
make
viewdvi
display
it
on
your
screen
make
ps
generate
a
postscript
version
of
your
document
make
viewps
display
it
make
clean
remove
unnecessary
things
make
veryclean
remove
even
the
dvi
file
make
makefiles
generate
makefiles
in
subdirectories
if
a
this
seems
attractive
to
you
b
you
are
willing
to
test
imaketex
and
send
me
a
short
test
report
c
you
are
willing
to
cope
with
a
rudimentary
english
documentation
however
the
german
version
is
completed
and
included
then
you
are
invited
as
a
beta
tester
i
am
looking
forward
to
your
