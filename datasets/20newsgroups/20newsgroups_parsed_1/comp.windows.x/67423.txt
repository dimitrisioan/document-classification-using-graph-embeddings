need
help
with
mitmagiccookie
im
trying
to
turn
on
xauthorization
using
mitmagiccookie
on
my
servers
cpu
heads
hprx
xterminals
but
im
running
into
a
couple
of
problems
first
at
least
one
of
our
applications
maple
doesnt
seem
to
understand
how
to
deliver
the
magic
cookie
and
wont
run
on
a
display
with
authorization
turned
on
second
we
have
people
with
client
software
on
remote
machines
and
i
really
dont
want
to
hassle
them
with
having
to
copy
their
xauthority
file
to
the
remote
machine
assuming
that
the
clients
there
support
xauthorization
so
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
turn
on
mitmagiccookie
by
default
with
nonprivileged
users
able
to
turn
it
off
dropping
back
to
hostbased
authorization
yes
i
know
how
to
turn
it
off
by
changing
the
xconfig
file
for
the
heads
and
the
client
authorize
setting
for
the
xterminals
but
nonprivileged
users
cant
do
this
ive
checked
with
the
hp
support
line
and
there
doesnt
appear
to
be
a
way
can
anyone
confirm
this
or
do
you
know
of
a
way
to
accomplish
what
i
want
btw
im
running
hpux
and
vue
thanks
in
advance
