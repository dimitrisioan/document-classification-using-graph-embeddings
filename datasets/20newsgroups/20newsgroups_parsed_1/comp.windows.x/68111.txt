problems
with
xdm

yes
that
is
a
bug
in
the
xr
port
of
xterm
you
sometimes
get
this
when
you
start
from
xdm
i
have
reported
this
to
casper
but
dont
know
whether
it
made
it
into
his
set
of
patches
yet
basically
in
mitclientsxtermmainc
there
is
a
test
at
line
which
checks
errno
after
attempting
to
open
devtty
add
the
errno
einval
case
to
it
and
you
should
be
fine
its
actually
a
bug
in
the
solaris
kernel
we
could
add
a
workaround
to
xterm
open
should
never
return
einval
but
it
does
i
didnt
have
time
to
update
the
rsunos
patch
lately
but
non
of
the
existing
problems
seem
to
warrant
a
new
set
of
patches
since
xsession
is
a
bourne
shell
script
anyway
you
might
as
well
add
a
line
etctimezone
as
it
is
done
in
etcprofile
xdm
coulda
also
keep
the
xdm
environment
variable
it
should
have
inherited
it
from
the
environment
casper
