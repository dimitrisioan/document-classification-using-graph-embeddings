re
blinking
cursor
in
xterm
as
quoted
from
by
bernward
averwald
back
in
the
days
of
x
i
did
analyse
the
xterm
code
the
cursor
was
implemented
by
drawing
a
rectangle
around
the
character
i
doesnt
seem
to
be
changed
til
now
but
if
you
have
the
sources
you
could
add
a
blinking
cursor
via
xtappaddtimeout
or
similar
the
server
overhead
for
this
is
mildly
ridiculous
though
see
also
desqviewx
which
does
this
in
its
dos
windows
do
you
really
want
xterm
to
wake
up
every
half
second
and
whack
the
server
into
doing
a
bitblt
brandon
