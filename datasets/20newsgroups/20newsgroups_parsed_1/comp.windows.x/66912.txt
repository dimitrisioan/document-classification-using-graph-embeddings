with
athena
text
widget
i
want
to
create
a
singleline
text
widget
for
entering
a
small
amount
of
text
i
want
it
to
be
of
fixed
width
but
have
a
horizontal
scrollbar
that
scrolls
automatically
when
the
user
types
in
order
to
keep
the
insertion
point
visible
in
trying
to
do
this
i
have
two
problems
the
addition
of
the
horizontal
scrollbar
does
not
make
the
text
widget
taller
but
instead
it
seems
to
cover
part
of
the
text
the
scrollbar
does
not
scroll
automatically
as
the
user
types
in
text
in
order
to
keep
the
insertion
point
visible
any
help
is
appreciated
