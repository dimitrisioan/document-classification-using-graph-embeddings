xlibxtmwm
i
am
developing
an
x
xtxm
application
that
will
include
a
graphics
window
of
some
sort
with
moving
symbols
among
other
things
a
pure
x
application
could
be
implemented
with
motif
widgets
one
of
which
would
be
an
xmdrawingarea
for
drawing
with
xlib
but
i
would
like
to
take
advantage
of
the
graphics
library
gl
available
on
our
ibm
rs
sgis
gl
i
believe
is
it
possible
to
mix
x
and
gl
in
one
application
program
can
i
use
gl
subroutines
in
an
xmdrawingarea
or
in
an
x
window
opened
by
me
with
xopenwindow
i
have
never
used
gl
before
but
the
doc
on
gl
winopen
says
that
the
first
time
winopen
is
called
it
opens
a
connection
to
the
server
also
most
of
the
gl
calls
do
not
require
a
display
or
gc
unlike
most
x
calls
from
this
initial
information
it
appears
that
x
and
gl
can
not
be
mixed
easily
is
this
true
does
pex
graphigs
have
the
same
functionality
of
gl
