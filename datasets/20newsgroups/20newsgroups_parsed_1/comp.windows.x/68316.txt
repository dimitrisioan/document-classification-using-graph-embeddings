eventhandlers
on
xmpushbuttons
help
ive
got
an
applications
with
a
series
of
pushbuttons
across
the
top
a
toolbar
i
wanted
to
add
eventhandlers
to
these
pushbuttons
on
enterwindowmask
and
leavewindowmask
so
that
i
can
put
up
some
descriptive
text
about
the
function
of
each
pushbutton
as
the
pointer
crosses
over
it
ive
done
this
fine
but
ive
turned
up
the
following
problem
when
the
pushbuttons
are
sensitive
i
get
callbacks
on
both
of
the
above
events
but
when
they
are
not
sensitive
i
only
get
callbacks
on
leavewindow
events
this
seems
odd
i
would
expect
this
to
be
an
allornothing
type
of
thing
is
this
a
bug
if
not
can
someone
explain
this
behavior
thanks
mark
