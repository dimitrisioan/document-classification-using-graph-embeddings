postscript
on
xterminal
i
have
a
problem
when
im
using
postscript
when
i
am
working
local
on
a
sun
sparcstaton
ipc
the
postscript
works
good
but
when
i
connect
to
the
sun
from
a
xterminal
i
just
get
error
messages
that
the
postscript
can
not
connect
to
the
newsdisplay
why
doesnt
postscript
work
on
an
xterminal
is
there
any
way
to
make
it
work
it
might
be
that
the
x
terminal
doesnt
support
the
postscript
extensions
to
x
product
i
use
the
dxpsview
program
on
a
decstation
to
view
postscript
files
but
when
i
moved
to
an
ncd
x
terminal
i
couldnt
use
it
any
more
so
i
ftpd
and
compiled
ghostscript
gnu
software
now
we
can
view
postscript
files
on
our
x
terminals
hope
this
helps
