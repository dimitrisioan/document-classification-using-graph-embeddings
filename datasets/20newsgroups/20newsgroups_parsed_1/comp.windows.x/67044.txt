how
do
i
cause
a
timeout
i
have
a
problem
where
an
athena
strip
chart
widget
is
not
calling
its
get
value
function
i
am
pretty
sure
this
is
happening
because
i
am
not
using
xtappmainloop
but
am
dealing
with
events
via
sockets
ya
ya
anyway
i
want
to
cause
a
timeout
so
that
the
strip
chart
widgets
will
call
their
get
value
callback
or
if
someone
knows
another
fast
way
around
this
or
any
way
for
that
matter
let
me
know
i
can
not
or
i
dont
think
call
the
xtngetvalue
callback
myself
because
i
dont
have
the
value
for
the
third
parameter
of
the
get
value
proc
xtpointer
calldata
in
other
words
i
want
to
force
a
strip
chart
widget
to
update
itself
any
ideas
anyone
