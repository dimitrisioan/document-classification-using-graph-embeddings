windows
on
bit
display
how
greetings
i
am
using
an
x
server
that
provides
visuals
pseudocolor
bit
truecolor
bit
and
directcolor
bit
a
problem
occurs
when
i
try
to
create
a
window
with
a
visual
that
is
different
from
the
visual
of
the
parent
which
uses
the
default
visual
which
is
tc
in
the
xlib
reference
guide
from
o
reilly
one
can
read
in
the
section
about
xcteatewindow
something
like
in
the
current
implementation
of
x
when
using
a
visual
other
than
the
parents
be
sure
to
create
or
find
a
suitable
colourmap
which
is
to
be
used
in
the
window
attributes
when
creating
or
else
a
badmatch
occurs
this
warning
strangely
enough
is
only
mentioned
in
the
newer
editions
of
the
xr
guides
however
even
if
i
pass
along
a
suitable
colourmap
i
still
get
a
badmatch
when
i
create
a
window
with
a
nondefault
visual
the
code
looks
like
this
cut
here
