ive
been
getting
mail
from
xhibition
about
the
june
conference
and
i
was
wondering
if
microsoft
had
bought
xhibition
the
front
says
conference
from
microsoft
windows
nt
developers
whats
the
deal
i
thought
xhibition
was
for
xwindows
jesse
w
asher
i
was
wondering
this
myself
and
not
surprisingly
when
you
look
at
the
audience
windows
nt
with
the
bulk
of
the
xhibition
audience
and
the
unix
community
developing
applications
for
inhouse
or
custom
use
a
new
bit
operating
system
from
a
player
as
large
as
microsoft
needs
to
be
evaluated
with
ms
windows
on
so
many
desktops
and
the
price
of
computing
power
dropping
its
successor
needs
to
be
evaluated
as
corporations
begin
to
look
at
nt
so
must
their
developers
and
suppliers
what
you
need
conference
attendees
will
receive
nt
software
development
kits
to
bang
on
evaluate
and
generally
to
see
for
yourself
i
hope
this
doesnt
sound
like
an
nt
commercial
it
should
sound
like
an
xhibition
commercial
unfortunately
it
does
i
dont
agree
with
the
logic
of
nt
at
an
x
windows
conference
perhaps
some
good
will
come
of
it
but
the
two
are
so
dissimilar
and
the
nt
marketing
stuff
is
so
large
in
the
xhibition
adds
that
i
was
coming
to
a
similar
conclusion
as
