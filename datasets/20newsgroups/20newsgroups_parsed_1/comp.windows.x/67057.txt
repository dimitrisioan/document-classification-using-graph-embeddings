the
application
creates
window
with
a
button
quit
and
press
me
the
button
press
me
pops
up
a
dialog
box
the
strange
feature
of
this
program
is
that
it
always
pops
up
the
dialog
box
much
faster
the
first
time
if
i
try
to
pop
it
up
a
nd
time
rd
th
time
it
is
much
slower
the
shell
is
waiting
for
the
windowmanager
to
respond
to
its
positioning
request
the
windowmanager
is
not
responding
because
it
thinks
the
window
is
already
in
the
right
place
exactly
why
the
two
components
get
into
this
sulk
is
unclear
to
me
all
information
greatly
received
