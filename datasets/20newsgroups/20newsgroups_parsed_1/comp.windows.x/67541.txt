these
are
two
common
subjects
so
i
hope
someone
has
had
to
deal
with
these
specific
questions
question
deleted
i
would
like
to
place
a
popup
so
that
it
will
be
to
the
immediate
right
of
my
main
window
i
want
it
at
the
same
y
coord
and
their
rightleft
sides
touching
what
i
need
to
ask
for
is
the
xy
coord
of
the
window
managers
border
for
the
main
window
this
should
ring
a
bell
with
anyone
who
has
called
xtmovewidget
immediately
checking
the
xy
after
the
move
and
seeing
that
it
is
right
and
in
their
next
callback
asking
for
the
xy
and
seeing
that
it
is
now
offset
by
the
wm
border
any
help
would
be
most
appreciated

i
have
done
this
before
but
im
not
sure
i
used
the
best
approach
although
i
tried
several
methods
you
have
to
run
up
the
window
heirarchy
using
xquerytree
until
you
get
to
the
root
window
now
this
is
not
so
simple
because
some
window
managers
slap
a
window
over
the
root
window
that
is
the
same
size
as
the
root
window
so
be
sure
to
take
that
into
account
for
further
calculations
calculate
the
position
and
widthheight
offsets
for
each
window
using
xgetgeometry
be
sure
to
take
the
borderwidth
into
consideration
remember
a
windows
borderwidth
is
on
the
outside
of
a
window
so
the
windows
xywidthheight
must
be
adjusted
accordingly
all
of
this
should
give
you
pretty
good
numbers
for
how
much
space
the
windowmanager
is
using
now
to
place
the
new
window
you
have
to
use
the
same
numbers
to
calculate
where
you
want
to
place
it
because
the
windowmanager
will
reparent
it
on
the
outside
of
where
you
place
your
window
if
i
remember
correctly
disclaimer
all
of
this
is
from
memory
and
i
no
longer
have
the
code
but
i
did
get
it
working
under
several
window
managers
correctly
feel
free
to
call
or
email
for
further
