open
look
is
a
specification
of
a
graphical
user
interface
gui
a
gui
determines
the
look
and

of
a
system
the
shape
of
windows
buttons
and
scrollbars
how
you

how

what
is
openwindows
openwindows
is
a
windowing
environment
that
conforms
to
the
open
look
graphical
user
interface
specifications
its
compatible
with
the
x
window
system
from
mit
as
well
as
currently
suns
news
and
sunview
so
you
can
intermix
programs
written
for
any
of
those
systems
it
comes
from
sun
and
also
with
system
v
release
from
certain
vendors
openwindows
is
sometimes
also
called
openwin
or
xnews
after
the
program
used
to
start
it
and
the
main
executable
itself
respectively
it
should
not
be
called
windows
or
open
look
or
openlook
as
these
terms
are
either
wrong
or
apply
to
something
else
a
commerical
openwindows
source
licence
costs
about
for
the
server
plus
about
for
deskset
and
another
for
tooltalk
the
current
versions
of
openwindows
for
various
platforms
are

these
are
all
toolkits
for
programmers
to
use
in

programs
that
conform
to
the
open

specifications
see
the
bibliography
for
documentation
on
the
individual
toolkits
heres
a
brief
summary
olit
was
atts
open
look
intrinsics
toolkit
for
the
x
window
system
it
used
a
widget
set
and
was
probably
the
easiest
for
people
who
were
already
xxt
programmers
to
learn
you
could
buy
the
source
from
att
although
you
didnt
get
the
same
version
tht
sun
ship
sun
includes
the
olit
library
in
openwindows
qv
it
is
also
often
included
in
system
v
release
it
was
written
in
c
the
release
of
olit
in
openwindows
was
olit
olit
support
passed
to
usl
then
a
division
of
att
now
owned
by
novell
who
replaced
it
with
moolit
qv
note
that
because
of
the
nature
of
xt
subclassing
you
will
probably
want
or
need
olit
source
in
order
to
develop
a
large
application
or
anything
else
that
uses
subclasses
see
the
proceedings
of
the
x
technical
conference
xview
is
suns
toolkit
for
x
written
in
c
xview
is
similar
in
programmer
interface
to
sunview
theres
even
a
shell
script
to
help
migrate
source
code
from
sunview
to
xview
xview
is
often
said
to
be
the
easiest
toolkit
to
learn
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
x
windows
the
xview
toolkit
is
included
in
openwindows
and
full
source
is
available
by
anonymous
ftp
from
exportlcsmitedu
and
elsewhere
the
current
version
of
xview
from
sun
is
despite
rumours
to
the
contrary
some
even
from
within
sun
the
xview
toolkit
is
not
about
to
be
dropped
by
sun
xview
will
be
included
in
the
next
release
of
openwindows
unlike
news
on
the
other
hand
the
xview
toolkit
is
not
likely
to
receive
as
much
attention
from
sun
in
the
future
as
olit
the
news
toolkit
tnt
was
an
objectoriented
programming
system
based
on
the
postscript
language
and
news
tnt
implements
many
of
the
open
look
interface
components
required
to
build
the
user
interface
of
an
application
its
currently
included
in
openwindows
the
current
version
of
tnt
from
sun
is
release
contains
some
incompatibilities
with
tnt
and
tnt
but
sun
are
committed
to
supporting
the
api
at
least
until
they
stop
news
support
some
time
later
this
year
and
replace
it
with
display
postscript
wail
you
might
ask
what
is
committed
to
means
in
this
context
the
answer
seems
to
be
that
it
means
absolutely
nothing
sun
currently
asserts
that
it
is
committed
to
olit
however
the
c
user
interface
toolkit
uit
consists
of
an
objectoriented
c
class
library
layered
on
top
of
xview
and
a
tool
to
generate
code
from
devguide
gil
files
the
uit
also
includes
features
that
simplify
event
management
and
the
use
of
postscript
and
color
it
is
said
to
be
compatible
with
openwindows
v
and
v
and
presumably
v
since
the
release
mentions
that
it
works
on
solaris
uit
is
not
an
official
sunsupported
product
but
an
ongoing
project
of
various
people
within
sun
it
can
be
found
on
exportlcsmitedu
in
the
mit
contrib
directory
as
uitvtarz
use
binary
mode
where
does
motif
fit
in
it
doesnt
motif
is
an
alternative
graphical
user
interface
that
is
being
developed
by
osf
it
has
a
look
and
feel
reminiscent
of
microsoft
windows
and
the
os
presentation
manager
there
are
no
non
commercial
motif
toolkits
available
although
the
motif
source
is
sold
reasonably
cheaply
by
osf
although
motif
is
currently
available
on
more
platforms
than
openwindows
the
open
look
gui
is
almost
certainly
used
on
many
more
machines
simply
because
sun
and
sysvr
have
such
a
large
installed
base
suns
cdware
volume
contains
a
roadmap
for
improving
motif
applications
by
converting
them
to
olit
there
are
also
notes
in
the
periodic
table
olit
demo
openwinhomedemoolittable
what
is
moolit
moolit
is
a
version
of
olit
from
attusl
that
lets
users
choose
between
a

and
an
open

at
runtime
it
will
be
part
of
system
v
release
contact
joanne
newbauer
what
about
that
display
postscript
thing
sun
and
adobe
have
agreed
that
sun
will
include
the
dps
extension
to
x
in
the
next
release
of
openwindows
dps
is
essentially
a
badly
designed
hack
on
top
of
a
slow
level
postscript
interpreter
intended
to
give
a
very
small
subset
of
the
functionality
of
news
whilst
simultaneously
being
harder
to
use
as
i
understand
it
the
only
real
advantage
it
has
over
news
is
that
the
manual
is
much
smaller
being
generally
less
complete
dps
is
also
available
on
more
kinds
of
machine
performance
on
our
rs
is
not
suitable
for
interactive
work
what
it
will
be
like
on
the
sparcstation
remains
to
be
seen
note
that
whereas
xnews
fonts
are
shared
by
both
subsystems
the
dps
extension
to
x
does
not
make
type
postscript
fonts
available
to
ordinary
x
programs
it
is
not
like
atm
on
a
pc
in
this
regard
there
is
at
least
one
thirdparty
version
which
does
make
fonts
available
however
subject
window
managers
olwm
olvwm
what
are
olwm
and
olvwm
they
are
window
managers
a
window
manager
is
the
part
of
the
x
window
system
eg
x
that
is
responsible
for
deciding
how
to
lay
out
windows
on
the
screen
and
for
managing
the
users
interaction
with
the
windows
olwm
is
the
standard
open
look
window
manager
its
included
with
all
of
the
openwindows
qv
implementations
and
you
can
also
get
the
source
by
ftp
since
sun
donated
it
olvwm
is
a
version
of
olwm
that
manages
a
virtual
desktop
hence
the
v
in
its
name
it
shows
a
little
map
on
the
screen
with
the
currently
displayed
area
represented
by
a
little
rectangle
you
can
move
around
by
dragging
the
rectangle
or
with
the
arrow
keys
this
lets
you
run
several
clients
applications
and
move
the
display
around
from
one
to
the
other
olvwm
was
derived
from
the
openwindows
olwm
by
scott
oaks
you
need
to
have
xview
to
compile
it
get
olvwm
from
an
ftp
site
such
as
exportlcsmitedu
in
the
contrib
directory
there
are
three
patches
can
i
use
my
favorite
window
manager
with
openwindows
instead
of
olwm
yes
if
you
use
twm
for
example
or
mwm
you
wont
be
able
to
use
the
pin
and
unpin
feature
of
olwm
and
you
probably
wont
see
the
footers
some
windows
use
to
display
certain
messages
if
you
use
twm
youll
want
to
use
the
fdelete
function
to
unpin
menus
and
get
rid
of
programs
that
dont
have
a
quit
button
when
not
run
under
olwm
for
twm
put
this
in
your
hometwmrc
lefttitlebutton
target
fdelete
where
target
is
a

subject
openwindows

can

use

without

on
an

terminal
the
openwindows
xnews
server
combines
sunview
news
postscript
and
x
this
means
that
it
can
run
programs
compiled
for
any
of
those
systems
unfortunately
it
means
that
some
openwindows
programs
need
either
news
or
sunview
support
and
thus
wont
run
on
an
x
terminal
this
includes
pageview
in
particular
you
can
use
olwm
or
olvwm
see
above
on
an

terminal
or
a
nonopen

display
and
most
open
look
clients
eg
olit
or
xview
ones
will
work
perfectly
well
you
may
find
that
you
get
complaints
about

not
being

if
so
see
the
fonts
section

if
you

subject
configuration
files
getting
started
with
openwindows
what
configuration
files
do
i
need
to
know
about
xinitrc
and
xsessionrc
the
first
time
you
run
openwindows
a
xinitrc
file
will
be
created
in
your
login
directory
home
if
it
already
exists
you
might
have
to
edit
it
somewhat
its
simplest
to
move
it
and
any
other
old
x
files
you
have
to
another
directory
and
then
merge
the
old
and
new
files
if
your
site
uses
xdm
you
should
use
xsession
instead
of
xinitrc
since
xdm
doesnt
look
at
your
xinitrc
file
openwininit
openwinmenu
and
openwinsys
these
are
optional
files
you
can
create
in
your
home
directory
depending
on
which
version
of
olwm
or
olvwm
you
use
look
in
openwinhomelib
normally
usropenwinlib
for
these
files
without
the
leading
and
copy
any
you
want
to
change
you
may
need
to
edit
your
xinitrc
to
get
them
recognized
if
you
are
not
on
an
x
terminal
you
will
want
to
run
a
console
window
such
as
cmdtool
c
shelltool
c
xterm
c
or
chuck
muscianos
contool
program
so
that
system
output
will
be
directed
there
instead
of
writing
over
your
screen
note
that
openwinsys
is
not
executed
unless
you
edit
xinitrc
xdefaults
you
can
put
x
windows
resource
specifications
in
here
in
particular
it
is
a
good
idea
to
include
at
least
openwindowsfocuslenience
true
input
true
these
allow
nonicccmcompliant
programs
to
receive
input
even
if
they
forget
to
ask
for
it
props
the
program
that
runs
when
you
select
properties
from
the
default
root
menu
under
olwm
or
olvwm
writes
your
choices
into
xdefaults
dont
put
comments
in
xdefaults
since
props
deletes
them
startupps
this
is
the
news
user
profile
file
read
by
openwindows
actually
xnews
on
startup
this
is
documented
in
the
news
programming
manual
near
the
back
the
most
useful
thing
to
put
here
is
postscript
code
to
change
the
keyboard
repeat
rate
although
you
must
be
very
careful
since
a
syntax
error
in
the
postscript
means
that
xnews
will
either
not
start
up
at
all
or
will
get
broken
in
strange
ways
the
news
manual
gives
code
that
is
both
incorrect
and
insufficient
warning
things
in
this
file
rarely
work
on
both
openwindows
and
note
that
the
mouse
speed
is
best
set

help
for
more
information
heres
what
homestartupps
should
look
like
if
you
want
a
delay
of
about
a
third
of
a
second
microseconds
and
a
repeat
rate
of
twenty
or
so
keys
per
second
microseconds
between
repeats
for
openwindows
youll
have
to
experiment
a
bit
because
the
repeattime
is
the
delay
between
keys
sent
and
thus
doesnt
include
the
time
to
process
each
key
which
is
probably
higher
on
my
than
on
your
supersparc
gti
injection
again
this
is
for
openwindows
dont
want

def

begin
keyrepeatthresh

storetimeval
def

note
and
differ
greatly
end
you
must
also
have
a

file
in
the
same

like
this
news
findpackage
beginpackage
tntcore
findpackage
beginpackage
tnt
findpackage
beginpackage
classrepeatkeys
pop
force
repeatps

endpackage
endpackage
endpackage
if
you
change
these
parameters
you
can
test
them
without
restarting
the
openwindows
server
like
this
psh
i
startupps
welcome

psh
i

classinit
classrepeatkeys
send
now
press
controld
you
can
also
either
of
these
two
files
startupps
and
userps
to
make
the
root
window
be
retained
so
that
a
postscript
drawing
on
the
background
wont
be
erased
when
you
move
windows
frambuffer
retained
true
put
will
do
this
note
that
this
may
increase
the
amount
of

dramatically

you
can
use

but
be
prepared
for
one
or
two
occasional
surprises
see
also
man
xview
for
a
list
of

you
can
change
at

for

programs
with

you
can
use
defaultsedit
to
set
the
mouse
mappings
and
then
let
sunview
handle
them
the

an
easy
way
of
editing
xdefaults
use
props
which
appears
in
the
default
root
menu
as
properties
this
starts
props
a
property
editor
which
will
rewrite
your
xdefaults
after
removing
comments
it
then
applies
any
changes
keep
comments
by
using
comment
instead
of
for
example
commentfont
palatinoitalic
how
do
i
get
the
file
manager
to
use
emacs
instead
of
textedit
set
the
default
editor
to
sh
c
exec
emacs
font
lucidasanstypewriter
file
you
can
change
the
font
if
you
prefer
a
smaller
one
how
do
i
run
openwindows
in
inverse
video
this
tends
not
to
work
under
openwindows
with
opwnwindows
there
are
various
ways
including
using
bg
and
fg
options
if
youre
using
openwindows
on
a
sun
probably
the
best
you
can
do
short
of
upgrading
the
workstation
to
a
sparc
is
to
use
xterm
instead
of
cmdtool
why
dont
flat
checkboxes
work
a
known
bug
may
make
guides
output
dump
core
if
you
use
these
a
workaround
is
to
edit
the
guide
output
as
its
only
guides
output
thats
broken
not
the
actual
checkbox
code
this
applies
only
to
versions
of
devguide
before
devguide
if
youre
still
using
an
ancient
devguide
you
should
upgrade
as
soon
as
possible
the
new
one
is
fantastic
when
i
leave
openwindows
my
screen
goes
blank
or
my
mouse
cursor
stays
on
the
screen
try
running
clearcolormap
if
this
helps
put
it
as
the
last
line
in
the
shell
script
you
use
to
start
openwindows
eg
openwin
when
i
use
snapshot
the
system
crashes
or
the
server
hangs
or
something
this
was
a
bug
related
to
some
systems
only
the
only
workround
was
to
use
some
other
screen
dump
program
such
as
xwd
xv
or
xgrabsc
why
have
some
of
my
function
keys
stopped
working
keys
f
and
f
changed
from
sunf
and
sunf
to
sunxkf
and
sunxkf
respectively
in
openwindows
applications
must
be
recompiled
or
you
might
be
able
to
use
xmodmap
or
the
public
domain
xkeycaps
program
to
change
your
keyboard
layout
back
again
when
i
type
shelltool
or
cmdtool
or
textedit
i
get
the

see
also
next
item
note
that
openwindows
includes
the
xr
core
distribution
to
patch
level
but
not
the
contrib
directory
these
notes
apply
to
openwindows
although
you
could
also
the
do
same
sort
of
thing
with
openwindows
and
xr
install
the
x
libraries
in
usrlibx
you
can
intermix
openwindows
and
xr
or
xr
theyre
all
compatible
in
this
respect
put
the
x
binaries
in
for
example
usrbinx
put
usrbinx
last
in
your
path
so
that
you
get
openwindows
versions
of
programs
instead
of
x
ones
where
appropriate
although
this
is
a
matter
of
preference
in
any
event
put
the
openwindows
bin
directory
first
see
the
preceding
item
for
more
details
on
that
if
you
have
bin
or
usrbin
theyre
the
same
directory
on
sunos
earlier
in
your
path
than
openwinhomebinxview
youll
get
sunview
programs
instead
of
openwindows
ones
set
ldlibrarypath
so
that
usropenwinlib
is
last
after
the
x
library
directory
this
doesnt
matter
with
openwindows
but
with
older
versions
youll
get
error
messages
from
x
programs
if
you
dont
do
this
the
messages
are
generally
harmless
see
next
item
although
xdm
core
dumps
if
this
isnt
right
set
openwinhome
to
the
directory
containing
openwindows
if
it
isnt
usropenwin
see
also
environment

especially
xfilesearchpath
i
get
error
messages
on
my

about
ldso
libxso
not

set
ldlibrarypath
to
be

if
you
also
use
x
use
usrlibusrlibusropenwinlib
if
you
put
this
in
a
shell
script
or
your
profile
use
openwinhomeusropenwinlib
instead
of

this
is
for

for

it
is

look

why
doesnt
answerbook
run
for
me
you
must
be
running
openwindows
to
use
answerbook
it
wont
run
under
x
on
an
x
terminal
or
on
anything
else
because
it
uses
news
to
draw
the
postscript
text
and
pictures
if
you
are
using
openwindows
you
need
to
use
the
openwindows
compatible
navigator
its
called
navigatorow
on
the
answerbook
cdrom
if
all
answerbook
users
are
using
openwindows
you
can
replace
navigator
wih
navigatorow
altogether
rename
the
old
one
first
to
satisfy
your
sense
of
paranoia
the
navigatorow
binary
is
also
on
cdware
vol
note
that
the
data
files
are
in
postscript
so
you
can
look
at

becasue

there
