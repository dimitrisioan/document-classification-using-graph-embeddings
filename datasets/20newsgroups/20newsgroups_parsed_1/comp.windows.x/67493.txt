xdm

i
am
using
xdm
on
xr
with
ow
and
xview
on
suns
and
sparcs
running
sunos
prior
to
using
xdm
i
used
to
set
path
and
other
environment
variables
like
manpath
helppath
arch
etc
in
my
login
file
with
xdm
the
login
file
doesnt
get
executed
and
therefore
neither
the
olwm
rootwindow
nor
my
applications
know
about
these
variables
one
usual
suggestion
is
to
put
everything
into
your
everytime
shell
rcfile
instead
of
your
loginonly
one
which
is
fair
enough
if
you
only
have
a
few
users
who
know
what
theyre
doing
if
you
have
several
hundred
users
who
do
what
the
books
tell
them
though
then
its
confusing
at
best
another
is
to
have
your
xterms
run
login
shells
but
that
still
leaves
the
window
manager
and
the
things
that
get
started
from
its
menus
with
the
wrong
environment
our
alternative
is
that
instead
of
having
xdm
run
the
client
startup
scripts
it
runs
the
users
favourite
shell
as
a
login
shell
and
has
it
then
run
the
rest
of
the
startup
scripts
that
way
the
users
usual
environment
gets
set
up
as
normal
and
inherited
by
everything
