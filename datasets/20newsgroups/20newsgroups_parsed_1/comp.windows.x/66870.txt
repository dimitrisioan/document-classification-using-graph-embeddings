re
xcopyplane
question
i
am
trying
to
use
xcopyplane
to
copy
a
single
plane
from
a
depth
pixmap
to
a
depth
pixmap
everytime
i
try
this
i
see
absolutely
nothing
displayed
i
know
there
is
data
in
the
depth
pixmap
becuase
i
have
checked
by
doing
an
xcopyarea
to
the
screen
i
have
been
successful
getting
xcopyplane
to
work
if
i
use
two
pixmaps
of
depth
is
there
a
problem
with
what
i
am
trying
to
do
could
someone
please
scan
my
code
segment
and
let
me
know
where
i
am
going
wrong
i
have
created
a
xmdrawingarea

called

have
you
set
the

background
colors
in
wgc
to
something
other
than
and
the
whitepixel

blackpixel
macros
on

may
not
return

are
you
sure
that
the
fifth
plane
of
the
data
isnt
all
the
same
you
could
have
different
pixel
values
in
the
image
but
the
fifth

x
might
all
be
the

if
you
just
want
to
see
the
plane
of
data
and
want
better
performance
dont
use
clipmasks
just
use
pixmap
as
the
stipple
in
a
stippled
rectangle
fill
many
servers
are
very
stupid
about
handling
complex
clip
lists
and
turn
a
bitmap
clip
region
into
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
little
clipping
rectangles
and
clips
every
drawing
primitive
against
every
one
of
these
little
triangles
actually
i
must
also
ask
the
faqs
most
popular
reason
why
graphics
dont
show
up
do
you
wait
for
an
expose
event
before
drawing
your
rectangle
