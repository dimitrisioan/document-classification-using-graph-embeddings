i
use
desqviewx
and
i
think
it
is
great
where
it
really
shines
imho
is
to
let
unix
users
log
into
a
pc
and
run
dos
and
windows
applications
with
the
display
going
to
their
screens
youll
need
to
get
desqviewx
v
desqviewx
v
suggested
retail
desqviewx
to
other
x
systems
v
suggested
retail
you
also
must
be
running
a
supported
network
ftp
softwares
pctcp
novell
lan
workplace
for
dos
sun
microsystems
pcnfs
beame
and
whiteside
wollongong
pathway
tcpip
or
hp
microsoft
lan
manager
if
you
dont
have
any
of
this
network
stuff
quarterdeck
will
give
you
a
copy
of
novell
tcpip
transprot
for
dos
with
the
network
manager
you
can
get
more
info
by
sending
email
to
appropriately
in
my
opinion
if
you
want
to
have
other
people
logging
in
and
running
applications
at
your
pc
youll
want
to
have
a
with
megs
of
ram
also
the
xwindows
software
in
desqviewx
really
seems
to
like
an
et
tseng
labs
chipset
based
graphics
card
personally
i
found
that
things
ran
better
with
a
scsi
drive
in
the
pc
than
with
esdi
drives
but
that
is
my
experience
only
good
luck
and
best
wishes

what
sort
of
traffic
is
generated
with
the
xcalls
i
am
curious
to
find
out
the
required
bandwidth
that
a
link
must
have
if
one
machine
running
dvx
is
supporting
multiple
users
clients
and
we
require
adequate
response
time
anyone
have
any
ideas
