am
looking
for
a
graphing
program
that
will
fit
my
data
to
a
straight
line
any
program
that
estimates
a
closest
fit
curve
or
gives
any
statistics
would
be
helpful
many
spreadsheets
do
regression
analysis

is
also
well
covered
in
most
undergraduate
statistic
books
cubic
splines
are
usually
well
covered
in
any
undergraduate
computer
science
numerical
analysis
text

gemm
has
a
well
stocked
library
i
have
never
used
mathematica
