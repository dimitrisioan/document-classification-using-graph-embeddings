available
memory
to
the

how
to
get
the
actual
size
hello
everybody
i
have
a
little
question
due
to
more
features
pex
dragdrop
many
applications
when
linked
with
for
example
motif
instead
motif
need
more
memory
in
the
xserver
xterminals
only
have
limited
memory
normally
no
swapping
possible
so
my
question
is
there
a
possibility
to
determine
via
x
protocol
calls
the
size
of
free
memory
available
to
the
xserver
so
one
can
determine
for
example
whether
to
start
a
pex
application
with
the
css
on
client
side
or
on
server
side
when
there
is
enough
memory
please
reply
via
email
ill
summarize
sincerly
