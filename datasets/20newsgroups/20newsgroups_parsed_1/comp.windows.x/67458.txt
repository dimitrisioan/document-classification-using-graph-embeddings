preventing
user
from
hitting
ctrlaltbksp
to
exit
x
hello
i
am
admin
for
an
rs
running
aix
xr
motif
and
xdt
i
want
to
prevent
the
user
from
hitting
cntlaltbkspc
to
exit
x
ive
tried
invoking
x
with
xinit
t
but
that
doesnt
work
xinit
appends
the
t
to
the
call
to
xinitrc
and
not
to
the
call
to
x
the
man
page
to
xinit
is
no
help
in
fact
it
tells
me
that
xinit
is
a
script
when
it
is
really
a
binary
file
so
far
the
only
way
ive
been
able
to
accomplish
this
feat
is
to
add
the
t
to
the
call
to
x
in
usrlppxdefaultsxserverrc
i
would
rather
not
do
it
this
way
does
anyone
have
any
other
ideas
