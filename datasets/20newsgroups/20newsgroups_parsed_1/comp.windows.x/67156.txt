tape
down
selections
i
just
had
an
idea
im
not
sure
if
its
been
done
and
im
just
remembering
it
unconsiously
but
i
thought
that
in
dialog
boxes
and
whatever
in
windowing
systems
there
should
be
a
way
to
intuitivly
set
some
things
checked
or
unchecked
or
filled
in
a
certain
way
my
idea
tape
you
know
like
putting
a
piece
of
tape
over
a
light
switch
just
an
idea
if
you
like
it
use
it
