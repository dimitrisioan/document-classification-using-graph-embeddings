converting
color
gif
to
x
pixmap
i
have
looked
through
the
faq
sections
and
have
not
seen
a
answer
for
this
i
have
an
xmotif
application
that
i
have
written
i
have
a
couple
of
gif
files
or
pict
that
i
have
scanned
in
with
a
color
scanner
now
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
convert
the
gif
files
into
a
format
that
could
be
read
into
my
application
and
displayed
on
the
background
of
its
main
window
preferably
with
pixmaps
or
perhaps
as
an
ximage
i
have
found
functions
in
the
pbmplus
program
suite
to
convert
gif
to
xbm
but
that
is
monochrome
and
i
really
do
need
color
i
have
looked
at
xv
which
reads
in
gif
and
writes
out
several
formats
but
have
not
found
a
way
to
write
out
a
file
which
can
be
read
in
as
a
pixmap
is
there
an
easy
way
to
do
this
