replicated
scalable
fonts
after
looking
at
the
scaling
code
i
realized
the
follwing
my
problem
with
the
resolution
x
foints
is
due
to
an
installation
problem
that
the
x
server
or
font
server
will
rescale
the
best
font
it
can
find
to
meet
your
requirements
this
means
that
if
you
server
return
a
response
like
the
following
adobehelveticamediumonormalpiso
you
can
ask
for
the
follwogin
adobehelveticamediumonormalpiso
and
it
will
generate
it
for
you
you
should
try
to
always
use
known
pixel
sizes
