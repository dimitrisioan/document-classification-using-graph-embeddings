how
can
i
detect
local
vs
remote
display
settings
i
am
trying
to
find
out
if
my
application
is
running
on
a
local
or
a
remote
display
a
local
display
being
connected
to
the
same
system
that
the
client
is
executing
on
i
have
access
to
the
display
string
but
can
i
tell
from
the
string
if
the
client
is
executing
on
host
foo
then
unix
foo
and
localhost
are
all
local
under
ultrix
i
believe
that
local
is
also
a
valid
display
name
a
shared
memory
connection
maybe
are
there
other
strings
that
i
should
check
for
is
there
a
better
way
to
detect
this
thank
you
for
any
help
