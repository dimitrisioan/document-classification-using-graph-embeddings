hello
does
somebody
know
the
functions
xtshellstrings
and
xtstrings
i
havent
found
them
in
any
librarys
not
xm
xt
nor
x
and
i
need
them
to
install
a
tool
any
hints
greatly
appreciated
please
reply
via
email
they
arent
functions
they
are
character
arrays
the
standard
strings
are
either
defined
as
string
constants
or
character
pointers
into
xtshellstrings
and
xtstrings
determined
by
xtstringdefines
your
libraries
were
compiled
with
this
defined
and
your
application
with
it
undefined
so
simply
recompile
one
or
the
other
it
is
probably
worth
adding
dxtstringdefines
to
your
cflags
