save
under
with
xr
i
have
the
following
problem
on
xr
servers
when
a
window
of
my
is
obscured
by
a
pop
up
window
which
has
the
save
under
attribute
set
the
subwindows
of
my
window
are
not
restored
normally
the
subwindows
are
redrawn
when
the
parent
window
gets
an
expose
event
but
because
the
save
under
attribute
is
used
for
the
pop
up
window
that
obscured
my
window
no
expose
event
is
sent
when
exposuremask
is
set
for
the
child
windows
those
windows
are
correctly
updated
when
the
popup
window
disappears
however
then
the
application
gets
too
many
expose
events
and
you
see
extra
redraws
everything
works
fine
with
xr
is
this
something
that
is
changed
between
xr
and
xr
obvious
is
it
something
i
do
wrong
is
there
something
that
the
popup
window
should
do
which
is
also
mine
is
this
a
bug
in
x
release
