numlock
masking
interference
with
metacomposeextendchar
my
question
is
this
is
there
a
means
of
determining
what
the
state
of
capslock
andor
numlock
is
alright
ignore
this
i
have
delved
a
bit
deeper
xkeyevent
and
found
what
i
was
looking
for
evstate
has
a
bunch
of
masks
to
check
against
lockmask
is
the
one
for
capslock
unfortunately
it
appears
that
the
numlock
mask
varies
from
server
to
server
how
does
one
tell
what
mask
is
numlock
and
which
are
for
meta
modmask
modmask
modmask
modmask
modmask
eg
sgis
vendor
server
has
modmask
being
numlock
whereas
solaris
openwindows
has
modmask
for
numlock
is
there
an
unambiguous
means
of
determining
numlocks
mask
at
runtime
for
any
given
server
sorry
for
the
wasted
bandwidth
and
my
appalling
ignorance
thanks
