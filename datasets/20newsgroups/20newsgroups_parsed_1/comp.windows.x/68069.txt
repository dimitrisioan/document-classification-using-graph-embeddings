question
hi
folks
im
trying
to
compile
xfig
on
a
ss
running
sunos
and
ow
and
im
having
a
little
trouble
with
makeimake
specifically
make
bombs
when
it
needs
to
use
any
xaw
file
this
isnt
surprising
since
x
files
on
suns
with
the
standard
ow
distribution
are
in
various
places
under
usropenwin
xaw
files
are
in
usropenwinshareincludexxaw
actually
the
real
problem
is
that
i
know
squat
about
imake
and
i
dont
know
how
to
tell
imake
where
the
x
files
are
i
can
see
from
the
makefile
that
its
looking
in
the
wrong
places
but
the
first
line
of
the
makefile
reads
makefile
generated
by
imake
do
not
edit
help
is
there
some
way
i
can
edit
the
imakefile
to
tell
it
where
to
look
i
have
set
defines
dopenwinbug
as
it
said
to
in
the
readme
file
email
and
post
are
both
fine
thanks
in
advance
dave
