hi
i
use
emacs
and
i
want
to
customize
my
keyboard
better
when
i
set
up
stuff
in
my
emacs
with
a
keymap
and
definekeys
i
can
only
access
certain
of
the
keys
on
my
xterminals
keyboard
i
cant
get
eg
f
home
end
pgup
pgdn
they
all
seem
to
have
either
the
same
or
no
keycode
i
have
a
feeling
this
cant
be
fixed
in
emacs
itself
but
that
i
need
to
do
some
xmodmap
stuff

a
similar
message
