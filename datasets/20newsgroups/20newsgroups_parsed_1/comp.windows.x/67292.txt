hi
netlanders
does
anybody
know
if
there
is
something
like
macintosh
hypercard
for
any
unix
platform
there
are
several
products
you
might
investigate
if
youve
got
per
seat
and
highend
hardware
gain
momentum
might
be
a
good
choice
it
isnt
compatible
with
hypercard
but
has
a
similar
architecture
and
way
more
functionality
i
dont
have
contact
information
but
they
were
recently
purchased
by
sybase
who
shouldnt
be
too
hard
to
find
if
youre
running
news
on
sparc
check
out
hyperlook
it
uses
postscript
as
a
scripting
language
which
is
good
if
you
need
to
do
lots
of
display
oriented
scripting
but
not
so
good
for
nonprogrammers
it
was
last
i
heard
you
might
also
look
at
our
product
metacard
were
alphatesting
direct
importing
of
hypercard
stacks
weve
even
made
the
test
release
available
for
anonymous
ftp
so
were
obviously
the
closest
in
functionality
metacard
runs
on
most
unix
workstations
and
costs
email
to
for
more
details
scott
thanks
in
advance
