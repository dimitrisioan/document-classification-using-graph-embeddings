there
many
people
using
linux
like
to
stay
at
the
cutting
bleeding
edge
ie
when
kernel
patches
c
library
or
compiler
patches
come
out
people
like
to
rebuild
their
entire
systems
the
prime
requirement
for
all
linux
software
is
that
it
is
available
under
a
gnu
style
public
license
hence
linux
software
uses
either
the
athena
widgets
or
xview
individuals
may
write
software
requiring
motif
but
i
doubt
it
is
widely
adopted
shameless
plug
the
xawd
widgets
make
athena
a
much
nicer
alternative
than
