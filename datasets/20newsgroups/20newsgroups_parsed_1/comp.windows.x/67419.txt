xv
has
escaped
chris

gripes
it
really
bums
me
out
that
xv
went
shareware
xvs
been
shareware
for
about
a
year
hadnt
you
noticed
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
this
john
bradley
has
put
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
work
into
xv
and
if
he
feels
that
its
time
to
get
some
monetary
reward
from
it
thats
surely
his
right
can
the
author
legally
sell
xv
xv
uses
tiff
and
jpeg
code
developed
by
others
did
the
author
get
permission
to
sell
these
works
had
you
bothered
to
consult
the
distribution
terms
of
the
ijg
jpeg
code
which
are
right
there
in
the
xv
distribution
you
would
have
observed
that
we
specifically
grant
permission
for
use
in
shareware
and
commercial
software
sam
lefflers
libtiff
copyright
also
grants
permission
for
unrestricted
use
including
resale
my
guess
is
that
now
nobody
is
going
to
want
to
help
the
author
maintain
the
code
anymore
now
that
xv
has
become
a
commercial
product
commercial
theres
a
big
difference
between
a
polite
request
for
a
voluntary
donation
and
commercial

i
do
agree
that
johns

could
be
a
little
clearer
about
what
