but
your
performance
will
suck
lemons
running
an
xserver
on
a
clone
i
have
a
clone
almost
with
no
name
generating
k
xstones
on
a
mhz
system
i
can
get
tektronix
xp
terminals
for
under
and
the
performance
is
over
xstones
im
running
linux
and
xfree
on
a
mhz
dx
with
mb
of
ram
mb
swap
and
it
runs
just
fine
its
a
lot
better
than
some
of
the
crappy
old
xterminals
in
the
labs
at
school
anyway
you
will
not
come
even
close
to
the
performance
of
an
xp
series
plus
you
excuse
me
but
with
a
k
cache
s
isa
card
mb
xs
xr
running
bsd
you
can
get
k
xstones
at
x
mhz
which
i
doubt
that
your
xp
series
gets
commerical
verions
x
servers
for
s
cards
can
get
k
xstones
so
the
performance
is
there
and
additionally
since
is
running
unix
multiple
users
can
use
the
system
which
i
have
done
in
my
home
setup
maintenance
is
minimal
if
you
can
read
readme
files
for
the
x
servers
and
for
bsd
