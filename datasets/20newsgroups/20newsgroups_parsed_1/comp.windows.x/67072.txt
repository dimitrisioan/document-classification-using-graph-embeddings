ive
had
several
requests
to
post
any
information
ive
gathered
regarding
my
search
for
ansi
mousecolor
xterm
source
my
only
response
was
from
larry
w
virden
who
writes
the
mit
x
r
and
r
both
provide
mouse
escape
sequences
now
there
are
several
color
xterm
enhancements
on
exportlcsmiteducontrib
indeed
i
found
colorxtermtarz
in
that
directory
along
with
lots
of
other
fun
stuff
for
x
thanks
larry
i
also
found
it
on
uunet
in
pubwindowsysxcontrib
for
those
that
can
only
do
anonuucp
like
me
but
i
noticed
that
the
thing
is
dated
making
it
over
two
years
old
is
this
really
the
latest
version
are
we
talking
about
an
xterm
which
would
accept
the
same
escape
sequences
as
that
for
vt
or
colour
dectermdxterm
i
thought
that
was
called
colxterm
and
my
testing
of
it
shows
some
oddities
that
might
be
bugs
or
might
be
my
program
going
wrong
im
also
unsure
of
what
is
meant
by
ansi
mouse
xterm
