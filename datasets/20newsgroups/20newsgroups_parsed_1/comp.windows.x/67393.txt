anybody
have
patched
version
of
xroach
for
tvtwm
i
read
about
the
code
you
can
put
in
to
most
applications
so
that
the
virtual
desktop
stuff
in
tvtwm
doesnt
confuse
them
or
is
the
application
confusing
the
virtualness
chicken
the
egg
but
wanted
to
see
if
it
has
been
applied
to
a
version
of
xroach
i
never
could
quite
get
ssetroot
to
work
either
any
suggestions
luckily
xv
root
quit
does
the
trick
for
the
most
part
also
ild
be
quite
interested
in
hearing
more
about
the
icon
region
for
each
virtual
window
under
tvtwm
that
i
read
a
thread
on
last
week

you
run
and
you
run
to
catch

with
the

around
to
come
up
behind
you
again
