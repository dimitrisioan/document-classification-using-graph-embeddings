anyone
know
what
is
available
in
terms
of
automated
testing
of
xmotif
applications
i
am
thinking
of
a
system
which
i
could
program
or
which
could
record
eventsoutput
with
our
verification
test
procedures
and
then
runrerun
each
time
we
do
regression
testing
i
am
interested
in
a
product
like
this
for
our
unix
projects
and
for
a
separate
project
which
will
be
using
openvms
a
question
like
this
is
answered
in
the

of
the
answers
is
xtrap

can
find
it
at
exportlcsmiteducontribxtrapvxrtarz
does
anyone
know
of
a
program
which
doesnt
require
an
x
extension
most
the
the
x

we
have
at
work
have
vendor
extensions
which
we
cant
modify
so
xtrap
doesnt
help
up
there
is
x
conferencing
software
at
mit
but
i
dont
know
how
easy
it
would
be
to
modify
it
to
do
record
and
playback
any
help
would
be
appreciated
