i
have
compiled
xfig
patchlevel
with
hps
xr
from
hpux
augmented
by
the
athena
and
mu
libraries
from
an
xr
distribution
from
iworksecnuiowaedu
it
compiles
nicely
although
for
one
file
the
preprocessor
macro
definition
table
size
needed
to
be
increased
but
when
executed
nothing
happens
at
all
except
for
evergrowing
memory
requirements
eventually
climaxing
in
a
core
dump
the
binary
of
the
identical
program
compiled
on
with
xr
has
no
problems
other
programs
like
xtpanel
compile
link
and
run
just
fine
with
the
same
libraries
does
this
sound
familiar
or
am
i
going
to
have
to
figure
this
one
out
on
my
own
please
see
the
post
i
made
yesterday
may
which
fixes
the
problem

they
dont
pay
me
enough
for
that
