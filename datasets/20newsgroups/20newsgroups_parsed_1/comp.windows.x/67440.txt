and
here
is
the
first
patch
the
following
fixes
some
problems
with
the
imakefile
files
and
makes
it
possible
to
compile
xv
under
solaris
without
having
to
use
the
ucb
stuff
oops
i
didnt
get
the
signal
processing
right
thats
what
i
get
from
doing
the
work
on
an
ascii
terminal
here
is
the
fixed
patch
the
patches
for
xvh
need
to
use
ifdef
svr
rather
than
the
overly
complex
if
definedsun
definedsysv
in
order
to
generically
compile
xv
on
isvrarchitecture
also
rand
and
srand
dont
work
very
welluse
lrand
and
seed
to
get
better
results
otherwise
xv
compiles
just
fine
on
my
esix
system
v
box
with
xfree
and
gcc
i
just
uncommented
the
gcc
definition
in
the
makefile
added
lusrxlib
iusrxinclude
to
the
copts
line
and
modified
libs
to
include
lsocket
lnsl
really
john
if
you
just
use
the
imakefile

like
this

even
have
