macx
color
problem
stan

writes
when
some
types
of
client
windows
are
displayed
parts
of
the
windows
are
in
the
wrong
color
if
the
window
is
moved
slightly
forcing
the
server
to
repaint
it
it
is
repainted
in
the
correct
colors
it
doesnt
happen
i
have
the
exact
same
problem
when
running
hewlett
packards
microwave
design
system
mds
from
an
hp
unix
box
and
running
macx
sys
normally
mds
draws
a
window
with
a
deep
blue
backround
but
occasionally
it
becomes
a
light
blue
and
all
the
text
etc
inside
the
window
become
washed
out
nearly
invisible
i
thought
that
it
was
just
something
brain
dead
that
i
was
doing
or
a
subtle
conflict
with
another
app
or
init
by
slightly
moving
the
window
and
forcing
a
redraw
the
colors
get
corrected
