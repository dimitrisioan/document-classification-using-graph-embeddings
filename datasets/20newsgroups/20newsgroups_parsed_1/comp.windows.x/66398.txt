ideas
on
how
to
integrate
c
code
elegantly
with
teleuse
uimx
interface
architect
generated
code
source
would
be

are
welcome

i
dont
know
a
great
deal
about
the
support
for
c
in
uimx
but
i
can
tell
you
that
there
is
good
support
for
it
in
teleuse
in
teleuse
you
can
call
any
c
method
from
a
d
module
what
you
can
do
then
is
to
use
the
d
language
for
most
of
your
interface
code
and
then
use
c
for
you
application
code
i
should
tell
you
that
there
is
some
real
neat
stuff
coming
out
of
teleuse
soon
in
regard
to
c
but
i
cant
give
you
many
details
you
should
talk
to
your
local
sales
rep
and
get
the
lowdown
on
what
they
will
be
doing
in
the
near
furture
if
you
want
example
code
of
how
c
integrates
with
teleuse
you
should
look
