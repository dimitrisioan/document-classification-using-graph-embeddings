im
just
guessing
here
but
id
guess
that
xr
expects
the
cg
to
have
x
resolution
and
the
version
of
the
cg
in
the
sparcclassic
is
x
ive
used
xr
with
classics
set
for
both
x
and
x
you
can
choose
which
resolution
you
want
in
the
prom
monitor
before
booting
one
person
had
trouble
with
xr
that
was
fixed
by
using
the
multiscreen
version
heres
how
our
version
was
built
you
can
just
copy

you
just
want
to
see
whether
