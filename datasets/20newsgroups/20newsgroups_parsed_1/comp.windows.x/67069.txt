for
some
reason
the
following
code
causes
my
x
application
to
beep
whenever
i
intercept
a
keystroke
and
change
its
meaning
the
intent
of
this
code
it
to
allow
date
fields
the
following
special
keys
tt
insert
todays
date
bump
day
up
by
one
bump
day
down
by
one
i
hardcoded
some
dates
for
this
example
perhaps
i
shouldnt
be
using
an
xmtext
field
for
this
for
some
reason
the
following
code
beeps
whenever
any
of
the
special
keys
of
tt
are
hit
why
the
idea
of
this
code
is
to
interpret
these
keys
having
the
special
meaning
implied
by
the
code
i
would
like
to
get
rid
of
the
beeping
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
im
not
doing
the
beep
and
am
at
a
lose
as
to
understanding
who
and
why
the
beeping
is
occuring
code
deleted
from
the
xmtextfield
man
page
during
discussion
of
resources
xmnverifybell
specifies
whether
a
bell
will
sound
when
an
action
is
reversed
during
a
verification
callback
you
are
setting
doit
to
false
in
the
callback
and
textfield
is
beeping
as
it
should
to
turn
off
this
behavior
set
this
boolean
resource
to
false
