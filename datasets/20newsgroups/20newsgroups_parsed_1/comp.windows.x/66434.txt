re
honors
degrees
do
they
mean
anything
kevin
davidson
writes
in
my
opinion
a
programming
degree
is
still
worth
having
yes
but
a
cs
degree
is
not
a
programming
degree
does
anybody
know
of
a
computing
course
where
programming
is
taught
computer
science
is
a
branch
of
maths
or
the
course
i
did
was
ive
also
done
a
software
engineering
course
much
more
practical
and
likely
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
an
employer
really
wants
rather
than
what
they
think
they
want
but
also
did
not
teach
programming
the
ability
to
program
was
an
entry
requirement
try
the
msc
computing
science
course
at
the
real
newcastle
university
its
a
conversion
course
but
at
least
they
teach
real
programming
in
the
space
of
months
we
were
taught
pascal
simula
prolog
miranda
also
some
basic
low
level
stuff
was
covered
as
well
they
also
did
concurrent
programming
and
operating
systems
some
software
engineering
plus
quite
a
few
optional
units
including
database
theory
and
some
stuff
about
comms
the
pascal
is
to
be
replaced
by
cc
i
think
next
year
i
learnt
this
and
x
windows
programming
as
well
anyway
via
a
good
selection
of
project
over
the
final
three
months
depending
on
your
tastes
the
selection
of
skills
learnt
can
be
quite
wide
reaching
the
one
critiscism
i
would
level
at
the
course
which
i
would
have
thought
invaluable
is
the
lack
of
an
option
to
do
the
project
period
in
industry
this
would
probably
need
a
slightly
longer
project
period
say
six
months
but
would
enhance
the
prestige
and
usefulness
of
an
already
excellent
and
thorough
course
yes
i
know
this
sounds
like
a
plug
for
the
course
why
not
