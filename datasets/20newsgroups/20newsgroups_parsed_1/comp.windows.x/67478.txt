xdm
and
env
vars
hi
i
am
using
xdm
on
xr
with
ow
and
xview
on
suns
and
sparcs
running
sunos
prior
to
using
xdm
i
used
to
set
path
and
other
environment
variables
like
manpath
helppath
arch
etc
in
my
login
file
with
xdm
the
login
file
doesnt
get
executed
and
therefore
neither
the
olwm
rootwindow
nor
my
applications
know
about
these
variables
i
used
the
displaymanageruserpath
resource
in
usrlibxxdmxdmconfig
to
succesfully
pass
the
path
variable
but
i
am
having
problems
passing
anything
else
i
tried
execing
homelogin
in
usrlibxxdmxsession
but
that
didnt
help
i
also
tried
using
displaymanagerexportlist
helppath
manpath
arch
which
didnt
work
either
i
would
appreciate
any
help
on
this
matter
thanks
in
advance
