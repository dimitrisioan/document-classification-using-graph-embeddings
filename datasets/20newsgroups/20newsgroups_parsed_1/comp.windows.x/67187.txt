help
on
xlib
and
include
files
hi
xperts
i
have
a
sparc
with
very
limited
disk
space
on
usr
partition
previously
i
was
able
to
run
all
xwindows
applications
and
then
i
upgraded
my
system
to
sun
os
and
realized
that
the
hard
disk
did
not
have
enough
space
to
load
openwindows
my
immediate
alternative
was
to
load
only
the
neccessary
files
to
boot
the
system
this
resulted
in
not
loading
openwindows
as
a
result
of
which
none
of
the
xlibraries
got
loaded
i
am
trying
to
load
just
the
libraries
and
include
files
and
binx
files
required
for
running
xwindows
and
compiling
my
programs
written
for
xlib
and
xaw
in
a
desperate
effort
to
regain
xwindows
i
retrieved
usrliblibx
files
from
the
tape
usrbinx
and
usrincludex
is
this
enough
for
running
xwindows
but
i
did
not
get
usrlibxfonts
sub
directories
these
are
mainly
dpi
dpi
and
misc
when
i
run
xinit
the
error
message
says
usrlibxfontsdpi
etc
are
not
in
the
default
path
but
the
problem
is
i
can
not
load
any
of
those
directories
as
there
is
no
disk
space
are
there
any
temporary
suggestions
before
i
get
a
gb
disk
and
load
openwindows
to
just
have
my
xwindows
running
thanks
pramod
