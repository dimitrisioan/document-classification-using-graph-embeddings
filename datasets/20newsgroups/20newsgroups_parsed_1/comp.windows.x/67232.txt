hey
guys
i
work
on
many
stations
and
would
like
this
name
and
current
logname
to
be
in
a
title
of
xterm
when
its
open
and
a
machine
name
only
when
its
closed
in
other
words
i
want
host
and
logname
to
appear
as
a
title
of
opened
xterm
and
host
when
xterm
is
closed
how
can
i
do
it
apologies
if
im
answering
something
already
answered
in
the
faq
our
news
feed
has
been
losing
a
lot
of
articles
lately
so
i
havent
seen
the
faq
lately
to
check
two
ways
when
you
start
the
xterm
you
can
use
command
line
options
n
iconname
to
set
the
icon
label
t
windowtitle
to
set
the
window
title
title
windowtitle
equivalent
to
t
windowtitle
you
can
use
escape
sequences
to
change
things
on
the
fly
the
basic
escape
sequence
is
esc
p
somearbitarytext
bel
where
esc
and
bel
are
the
ascii
escape
and
bell
characters
p
is
an
ascii
decimal
digit
or
depending
on
whether
you
are
trying
to
set
the
window
or
icon
title
or
both
and
somearbitarytext
is
your
desired
label
string
hence
this
command
will
set
the
window
icon
title
echo
yourtitlegoesherec
to
set
just
the
icon
title
echo
yourtitlegoesherec
to
set
just
the
window
title
echo
yourtitlegoesherec
of
course
you
may
have
to
fiddle
with
exact
syntax
depending
on
how
the
echo
command
works
on
your
system
and
what
shell
you
are
using
ive
shown
systemv
semantics
under
bourne
or
korn
shells
hint
for
sun
os
users
use
usrbinecho
instead
of
binecho
or
cshs
builtin
echo
otherwise
youll
have
to
embed
literal
esc
and
bel
characters
in
the
string
instead
of
using
convenient
octal
sequences
if
you
want
your
titlebar
updated
continously
say
to
show
your
current
directory
hostname
or
somesuch
then
youll
have
to
see
if
you
can
coerce
your
shell
into
spitting
out
the
appropriate
escape
sequences
when
it
prompts
for
commands
sometimes
you
can
just
put
the
appropriate
escape
sequence
in
the
prompt
string
itself
sometimes
not
