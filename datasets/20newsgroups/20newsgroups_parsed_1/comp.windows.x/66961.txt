i
am
reposting
this
because
i
am
not
sure
my
first
post
ever
made
it
out
i
have
built
and
installed
xr
on
my
sparcstation
my
aim
is
to
run
the
mit
x
server
but
retain
the
openlook
window
manager
i
am
sure
this
is
not
uncommon
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
change
andor
delete
everything
that
i
need
to
for
instance
i
can
start
xdm
in
rclocal
but
how
do
i
get
rid
of
xnews
the
openlook
window
manager
source
is
available
on
the
mit
contrib
tapes
or
from
exportlcsmitedu
i
would
suggest
building
this
too
rather
than
using
the
version
from
openwindows
it
is
olwm
v
i
would
suggest
skipping
olwm
and
getting
olvwm
instead
this
version
of
the
olwm
window
manager
implements
a
virtual
desktop
that
i
find
really
handy
even
on
large
monitors
this
version
is
also
available
at
exportlcsmiteducontribolvwmtarz
the
readme
file
also
suggest
getting
the
files
in
contribxview
in
my
case
i
built
the
x
server
first
xview
second
then
olvwm
all
of
these
were
installed
into
usrx
once
i
verified
the
server
worked
correctly
i
happily
issued
rm
rf
usropenwin
using
gcc
to
build
all
of
the
above
resulted
in
a
windowing
system
that
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
identical
to
openwindows
and
that
is
incredibly
faster
there
is
a
bit
of
tweaking
you
will
have
to
do
if
you
want
things
to
work
exactly
like
openwindows
but
not
much
