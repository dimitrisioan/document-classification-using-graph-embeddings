subject
books
on
icc
other
than
iccm
can
anyone
recomend
a
good
book
or
article
on
interclient
communications
besides
iccm
ive
looked
everywhere
i
can
and
it
seems
everyone
tells
you
how
to
do
it
but
nobody
shows
you
how
oreilly
has
no
examples
iccm
has
no
examples
asente
swick
give
no
examples
in
fact
most
of
the
books
ive
looked
at
if
they
discuss
icc
at
all
simply
give
a
condensed
version
of
the
iccm
and
then
refer
you
to
the
iccm
i
did
find
one
example
of
how
to
use
atoms
and
properties
in
youngs
book
and
five
hours
after
i
bought
youngs
book
i
had
my
applications
talking
to
each
other
i
am
not
sure
however
if
thats
the
best
way
id
like
to
stay
independent
of
unix
so
pipes
andor
sockets
probably
arent
the
way
to
go
but
within
x
one
can
also
use
messages
the
clipboard
and
perhaps
window
groups
i
need
a
text
that
discusses
the
various
methods
discusses
which
method
is
best
for
which
purpose
and
gives
examples
without
examples
its
all
just
words
thanks
in
advance
ross
