re
interface
to
access
separate
appl
in
article

dear
xperts
heres
my
problem
i
am
designing
several
related
x
applications
each
one
is
a
separate
executable
and
id
like
to
build
a
single
control
window
that
would
allow
the
user
to
access
each
application
instead
of
having
to
locate
the
correct
icon
the
control
window
would
contain
a
button
for
each
application
and
by
pressing
it
the
applications
main
window
would
appear
i
would
also
like
to
use
the
applications
button
as
a
color
status
indicator
has
anyone
done
this
or
have
any
good
ideas
because
these
are
all
separate
executables
this
seems
like
a
communications
nightmare
to
me
but
maybe
im
wrong
id
appreciate
any
ideas
im
using
xr
and
motif
thanks
i
can
think
of
two
different
methods
that
you
could
try
use
fork
and
execv
use
the
system
called
in
your
program
im
assuming
that
youre
running
under
the
unix
os
of
course
steve
o
o
just
say
no
to
vms
