i
need
source
for
splines
in
article
gordon
lang
writes
in
the
xlib
programming
manual
orielly
associates
it
is
pointed
out
that
routines
for
drawing
splines
is
not
included
in
xlib
but
extensions
are
publicly
available
i
need
spline
routines
which
work
within
the
x
environment
i
have
previously
posted
a
similar
request
and
got
two
responses
both
directing
me
to
the
interviews
package
at
interviewsstanfordedu
i
got
it
but
it
is
too
much
it
looks
like
too
much
work
to
try
to
identify
extract
and
modify
relevant
components
i
am
looking
for
code
that
is
not
encumbered
by
a
complex
and
extensive
framework
which
is
beyond
our
needs
we
just
need
the
spline
extensions
to
the
xlib
look
in
xfig
it
has
two
types
of
spline
algorithms
and
is
relatively
simple
xfig
is
available
from
exportlcsmitedu
in
