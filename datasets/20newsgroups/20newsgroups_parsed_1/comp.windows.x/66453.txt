subject
string
to
widget
resource
converter
can
anybody
tell
me
how
to
use
the
xmu
function
xmucvtstringtowidget
i
want
to
specify
a
widget
name
in
a
resource
file
so
that
i
can
connect
two
widgets
together
on
an
xmform
ie
myproggymylistswtopwidget
maintextsw
however
when
i
run
the
program
i
get
the
message
warning
no
type
converter
registered
for
string
to
window
conversion
just
like
the
manual
sez
i
have
managed
to
find
this
bit
of
code
which
seems
to
be
the
correct
way
to
go
about
this
static
xtconvertargrec
parentcvtargs
xtwidgetbaseoffset
xtpointerxtoffsetof
corerec
coreparent
sizeofcorewidget
xtsettypeconverter
xtrstring
xtrwidget
xmucvtstringtowidget
parentcvtargs
xtnumberparentcvtargs
xtcacheall
null
however
i
havent
got
a
clue
where
to
put
it
the
example
code
i
have
seems
to
suggest
i
can
only
do
this
if
i
am
creating
my
own
widget
but
elsewhere
it
says
that
i
can
add
it
to
a
widgets
classintialize
function
how
whats
one
of
those
if
anybody
has
any
code
to
do
this
please
let
me
know
the
trick
im
sure
this
is
a
faq
thanks
in
advance
rik

are
the
header
files
coreph
and
intrinsicsph

i
use
these
or
