question
on
xon
in

hi
folks
say
im
new
to
r
and
have
one
quick
question
in
using
xon
xon
machinename
i
notice
that
it
always
comes
up
with
a
very
small
window
im
pretty
sure
its
the
default
font
my
xterms
all
work
normally
is
xon
supposed
to
read
your
xresources
for
a
font
size
xrdb
q
appears
to
show
the
right
stuff
i
can
use
xon
with
arguments
such
as
xterm
fn
x
etc
and
everything
is
correct
of
course
you
could
always
do
a
simple
script
to
do
this
but
i
have
a
feeling
im
missing
something
simple
here
comments
suggestions
appreciated
thanks
in
advance
