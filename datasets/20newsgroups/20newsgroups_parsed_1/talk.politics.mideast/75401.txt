why
do
jews
who
dont
even
believe
in
god
as
is
the
case
with
many
of
the
founders
of
secular
zionism
have
a
right
in
palestine
more
than
the
inhabitants
of
palestine
just
because
god
gave
you
the
land
gd
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
some
of
the
land
was
in
fact
given
to
the
jews
by
the
united
nations
quite
a
bit
of
it
was
purchased
from
arab
absentee
landlords
present
claims
are
based
on
prior
ownership
purchase
from
aforementioned
absentee
landlords
award
by
the
united
nations
in
the
partition
of
the
palestine
mandate
territory
and
as
the
result
of
defensive
wars
fought
against
the
egyptians
syrians
jordanians
et
al
why
do
most
of
them
speak
of
the
west
bank
as
theirs
while
most
of
the
inhabitants
are
not
jews
and
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
israel
first
i
should
point
out
that
many
jews
do
not
in
fact
agree
with
the
idea
that
the
west
bank
is
theirs
since
however
i
agree
with
those
who
claim
the
west
bank
i
think
i
can
answer
your
question
thusly
the
west
bank
was
what
is
called
the
spoils
of
war
hussein
ordered
the
arab
legion
this
is
very
funny
anyway
suppose
that
in
fact
israel
didnot
attack
jordan
till
jordan
attacked
israel
now
how
do
you
explain
the
attack
on
syria
in
syria
didnot
enter
the
war
with
israel
till
the
th
day
by
the
way
it
is
funny
that
you
are
implying
that
the
reason
behind
by
israel
was
only
to
capture
sinai
egypt
to
attack
israel
which
was
a
poor
move
seeing
as
how
the
israelis
promptly
kicked
his
butt
the
territory
is
therefore
forefeit
retaining
possession
of
all
of
the
west
bank
is
not
desirable
but
it
beats
national
suicide
for
the
israelis
put
another
way
one
could
ask
why
it
is
that
so
many
palestinians
seem
to
think
that
telaviv
belongs
to
them
and
the
future
state
of
palestine
as
long
as
this
state
of
affairs
continues
it
seems
that
to
give
the
palestinians
a
place
from
which
they
can
launch
attacks
on
jews
is
a
real
poor
idea
giving
up
the
entire
west
bank
would
be
idiotic
froma
security
standpoint
in
addition
there
is
the
small
matter
of
jerusalem
which
is
considered
to
be
part
of
the
west
bank
the
chances
of
the
israelis
giving
up
jerusalem
are
nil
even
leftists
who
think
yasser
is
a
really
cool
dude
like
yossi
sarid
arent
going
to
propose
giving
up
jerusalem
if
he
did
hed
get
run
out
of
town
on
a
