writes
for
those
of
you
who
are
against
us
to
commit
ground
troops
fine
just
lift
the
armsembargo
on
both
sides
since
we
know
that
serbs
always
got
the
heavy
weapons
form
federal
army
wake
up
west
and
admit
that
you
are
the
most
uncivilized
the
most
hypocratic
and
the
most
violent
bunch
on
this
earth
khalid
c
akgun
writes
it
is
also
so
easy
to
blame
the
west
for
their
indiffernce
to
real
bosnian
suffering
how
about
the
moslem
world
about
billion
how
about
them
ha
what
they
are
doing
to
stop
this
massacre
why
the
oil
rich
arab
states
make
the
bosnian
crises
a
national
interest
of
the
west
especially
for
europeans
we
all
know
they
can
do
it
over
night
dont
we
blaming
west
and
asking
why
they
dont
put
their
life
into
danger
seems
to
be
the
choice
of
muslims
too
i
think
who
is
sleeping
is
not
the
west
they
are
wide
awake
they
are
trying
to
save
the
face
please
read
my
post
carefully
i
am
saying
that
lift
the
arms
emargo
and
let
the
muslims
defend
themselves
the
point
is
these
europians
civilized
countries
neither
want
to
get
intervene
militarily
themselves
and
nor
they
like
to
see
the
muslims
of
the
world
to
help
the
oppressed
remember
what
happened
almost
one
year
ago
when
the
so
called
un
discovered
some
riffles
in
an
iranian
jet
in
bosnia
the
west
is
not
indifferent
in
this
matter
they
are
siding
with
serbs
by
keeping
this
embargo
on
only
muslim
side
okay
onpaper
on
both
sides
khalid
disclamer
these
are
my
opinions
only
and
they
have
nothing
