muslim
in
exyugoslavia
was
a
nation
not
a
religion
in
fact
not
all
muslims
in
bh
are
followers
of
islam
therefore
there
do
did
exist
in
exyugoslavia
christian
muslims
yeah
thats
it
youve
really
outdone
yourself
this
time
nick
dont
forget
the
davidian
muslims
islam
is
not
a
race
its
a
religion
you
can
be
white
black
fijian
or
alaskan
i
guess
you
didnt
absorb
too
much
of
the
malcolm
x
interest
circulating
you
see
the
whole
point
of
islam
is
that
it
stresses
equality
amongst
all
peoples
now
i
do
realize
this
is
difficult
for
you
to
comprehend
given
your
staunch
beliefs
in
serbian
ethnic
cleansing
but
give
it
a
try
its
really
not
that
difficult
is
your
stomach
all
right
unable
to
digest
your
lunch
cool
down
in
the
context
of
bosnia
muslims
are
a
nation
and
nobody
talked
about
them
being
a
race
it
is
a
civil
war
in
which
the
terms
of
secession
are
being
negotiated
with
guns
instead
of
pens
the
croat
muslim
and
serb
political
leaders
all
chose
to
fight
over
the
terms
of
secession
instead
of
compromising
and
peacefully
negotiating
multilateral
secession
agreements
terms
of
secession
you
are
of
course
joking
right
nick
nobody
chose
to
fight
bosnia
and
croatia
were
internationally
recognized
nations
when
the
serbs
attacked
and
started
on
their
welldocumented
genocide
that
makes
them
an
outside
aggressor
its
a
simple
genocide
a
classical
example
of
ethnic
cleansing
there
is
no
question
of
civil
war
and
yugoslavia
was
a
recognized
nation
if
you
apply
the
principle
of
self
determination
to
yugoslavia
then
you
should
apply
it
to
croatia
and
bosnia
of
course
you
might
want
to
apply
again
to
kossovo
