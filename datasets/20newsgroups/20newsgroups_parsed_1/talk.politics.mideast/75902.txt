how
many

does
it
take
to
kill
a

native
child
a
four
two
fasten
his
arms
one
shoots
in
the
face
and
one
writes
up
a
false
report
making
stupid
and
idiot
jokes
about
soliders
will
not
bring
anything
not
mentioning
peace
or
agreement
i
also
know
several
tens
of
jokes
about
arabs
palestinians
but
i
do
not
post
them
to
usenet
anywaynot
to
this
newsgroup
since
i
dont
think
i
will
achieve
any
target
but
making
other
parts
furiousand
this
is
not
my
target
if
this
is
your
targetwellthat
tells
a
lot
about
you
can
nick
steel
provide
documentation
for
this
alleged
incident
did
you
really
think
he
is
talking
about
something
realistic
harry
you
must
be
kidding
this
is
not
a
single
incident
now
this
has
become
a
daily
life
practice
in
gazza
if
you
mean
the
killing
of
children
by
armed
soldiers
yeahwellsometimeswhen
cowards
put
their
children
and
wives
in
the
front
line
so
their
enemy
can
not
do
anythingwellmaybe
in
those
casesyou
have
no
better
thing
to
do
to
save
your
life
than
shooting
and
if
parents
want
their
children
alivei
think
it
would
be
better
that
before
they
get
out
to
throw
stonesmolotov
botllesor
when
they
come
to
kill
solidersto
keep
their
children
in
the
houses
if
you
are
objecting
the
number
of
occupying
israeli
soldiers
terrorists
or
the
way
they
do
it
then
look
in
the
dictionary
at
the
word
terrorism
it
says
nu
the
use
of
threats
of
violenceand
violence
esp
for
political
purposes
it
sounds
more
like
your
guys
i
caan
assure
you
that
they
do
worse
than
that
just
as
yeah
welli
guess
you
were
in
thereand
you
know
it
all
example
children
were
killed
this
month
of
ramadhan
two
of
them
by
military
vehicules
an
other
similar
incident
by
vehicule
was
the
one
of
feb
ramadhan
where
thee
military
truck
on
purpose

a
passenger

on
purpose

about
this
casealthough
i
dont
deny

truck

in
the
car

his
zionist
equipment

he
thought
to
himselfhey

i
make
an
accident
and
kill
the
enemy
maximum
i
will
die
too
in
the
crashbut
what
do
i
care
hakim
actually
if
can
remember
correctly
was
it
not
reported
and
even
on
camera
some
time
during
the
israeli
invasion
of
lebanon
or
when
the
itifada
began
that
cnn
caught
regular
uniformed
israeli
soldiers
breaking
the
arms
of
some
arab
youngsters
in
a
very
professional
and
brutal
manner
someone
please
give
full
details
if
they
can
remember
this
is
one
of
the
few
wellit
was
about
years
ago
in
the
intifada
the
fact
that
you
cant
remember
the
time
prooves
how
much
do
you
care
about
it
i
do
not
think
that
what
the
soliders
did
was
correct
but
i
will
not
agree
that
they
were
breaking
their
armsi
saw
that
filmandunlike
in
the
usait
was
broadcasted
entirely
not
long
ago
in
a
talk
show
and
at
the
end
the
armbroken
guys
got
up
and
walked
and
used
their
arms
very
good
they
guy
who
did
it
was
interviewed
and
he
said
he
did
it
because
the
terrorist
or
whatever
he
was
refused
to
take
his
ordersand
spitted
in
his
face
what
ammount
of
truth
exist
in
this
statement
i
can
not
tell
youbecause
i
wasnt
there
but
the
guy
who
did
it
was
in
prisonif
it
makes
you
any
good
occassions
on
which
such
a
scene
has
been
transmitted
to
the
west
and
in
the
usa
it
caused
uproar
and
was
one
of
the
factors
that
has
significantly
changed
the
preception
of
the
israeli
armys
role
in
the
mideast
noit
didnt
the
israeli
army
is
still
the
most
important
army
in
the
midlle
eastit
is
still
the
only
human
armyas
much
as
an
army
can
be
humanto
any
american
who
will
claim
the
oppositei
can
only
remember
the
cnn
broadcasting
of
the
american
solider
who
beat
a
somalian
boy
it
was
very
cruel
to
seebut
i
wont
say
because
of
this
that
the
american
army
is
cruel
so
there
is
proof
for
you
it
is
obvious
that
is
a
systematic
policy
of
the
israelis
which
must
be
occurring
on
a
massive
scale
behind
the
scenes
some
kind
of
proof
obvious
where
from
if
you
say
it
is
behind
the
scenes
how
do
you
know
about
it
nadeem
i
just
wanted
to
show
how
much
garbadge
one
can
saywithout
knowing
anything
about
what
he
saysand
living
a
life
far
away
from
the
place
he
