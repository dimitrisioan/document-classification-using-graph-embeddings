while
you
brought
up
the
separate
question
of
israels
unjustified
policies
and
practices
i
am
still
unclear
about
your
reaction
to
the
practices
and
polocies
reflected
in
the
article
above
tim
not
a
separate
question
mr
clock
it
is
deceiving
to
judge
the
resistance
movement
out
of
the
context
of
the
occupation
alaa
zeineldine
when
the
plo
moved
into
lebanon
and
became
in
parts
of
lebanon
an
occupying
power
itself
these
same
practices
were
common
against
nonpalestinean
and
palestinean
alike
they
are
simply
standard
operating
procedures
among
palestineans
and
have
been
for
a
very
long
time
in
fact
the
greatest
bloodbath
of
palestineans
will
happen
when
they
get
selfrule
can
you
possibly
deny
this
when
the
plo
is
the
occupier
who
are
you
