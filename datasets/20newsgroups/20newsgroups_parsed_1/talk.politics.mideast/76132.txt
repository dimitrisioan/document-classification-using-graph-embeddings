hebrew
labor
is
a
concept
which
has
served
the
zionist
movement
for
a
long
time
it
has
a
doublebarreled
message
the
new
jew
must
learn
to
do
physical
labor
ie
working
the
land
the
land
in
this
country
must
pass
into
jewish
hands
ie
to
the
same
new
jew
who
has
learned
to
work
it
both
aspects
of
the
twopronged
concept
of
hebrew
labor
have
racist
connotations
on
the
one
hand
the
diaspora
jews
lack
of
training
in
physical
labor
is
a
myth
shared
by
zionists
and
antisemites
on
the
other
hand
its
meaning
in
practice
has
been
the
displacement
of
the
arab
farmer
from
the
source
of
his
livelihood
the
occupation
and
the
cheap
palestinian
labor
which
streamed
from
the
occupied
territories
to
the
factories
orchards
and
hothouses
of
israel
relegated
the
myth
of
hebrew
labor
to
the
history
books
and
nostalgic
memories
of
the
zionist
movement
it
has
blossomed
forth
anew
however
as
the
governments
answer
to
problems
caused
by
the
closure
of
the
territories
today
too
this
concept
has
two
functions
to
give
a
progressive
look
to
the
closing
of
the
palestinian
population
or
in
the
words
of
environment
minister
yossi
sarid
i
have
no
tears
for
those
who
get
rich
off
of
cheap
labor
to
furnish
an
answer
to
the
unemployed
israeli
who
complains
of
being
obliged
to
work
for
wages
that
are
lower
than
the

insurance
he
receives
the
israeli
government
is
considering
plans
to
import
labor
from
the
far
east
to
replace
native
people
palestinians
who
work
in
their
