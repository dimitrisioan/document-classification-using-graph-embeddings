palestine
was
a
name
given
to
that
same
area
after
the
jews
already
had
their
own
governments
there
for
a
very
long
time
palestinean
nationality
is
a
recent
political
invention
no
more
than
a
few
decades
old
this
is
what
the
jew
jake
says
to
that
this
may
be
true
but
i
think
we
jews
dismiss
palestinian
nationalism
at
our
peril
its
newness
doesnt
obviate
its
reality
besides
israeli
nationalism
is
a
new
phenomenum
as
well
israeli
nationalism
also
known
as
zionism
is
the
nationalism
of
the
jewish
people
the
jewish
people
are
not
a
new
phenomenon
at
all
palestinean
nationalism
is
the
nationalism
of
arab
people
arabs
have
been
around
for
a
long
time
they
already
have
some
dozen
states
large
and
small
covering
of
the
middle
east
more
specifically
palestinean
nationalism
is
the
nationalism
of
arabs
from
the
region
of
palestine
just
as
egyptian
nationalism
is
the
nationalism
of
arabs
from
the
region
of
egypt
one
palestinean
state
already
exists
in
what
was
once
known
as
palestine
it
is
called
jordan
there
is
no
justification
in
carving
out
a
second
and
tiny
palestinean
state
out
of
the
only
jewish
state
itself
very
very
small
just
as
there
is
no
justification
in
carving
out
another
american
state
out
of
mexico
