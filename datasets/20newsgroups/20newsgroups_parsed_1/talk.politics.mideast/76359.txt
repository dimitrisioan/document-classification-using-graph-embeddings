p

in
those
moslem
villages
in
the
plain
below
which
had
been
searched
for
arms
by
the
armenians
everything
had
been
taken
under
the
cloak
of
such
search
and
not
only
had
many
moslems
been
killed
but
horrible
tortures
had
been
inflicted
in
the
endeavour
to
obtain
information
as
to
where
valuables
had
been
hidden
of
which
the
armenians
were
aware
of
the
existence
although
they
had
been
unable
to
find
them
p
first
paragraph
the
arrival
of
this
british
brigade
was
followed
by
the
announcement
that
kars
province
had
been
allotted
by
the
supreme
council
of
the
allies
to
the
armenians
and
that
announcement
having
been
made
the
british
troops
were
then
completely
withdrawn
and
armenian
occupation
commenced
hence
all
the
trouble
for
the
armenians
at
once
commenced
the
wholesale
robbery
and
persecution
of
the
muslem
population
on
the
pretext
that
it
was
necessary
forcibly
to
deprive
them
of
their
arms
in
the
portion
of
the
province
which
lies
in
the
plains
they
were
able
to
carry
out
their
purpose
and

manner
in
which
this
was
done
