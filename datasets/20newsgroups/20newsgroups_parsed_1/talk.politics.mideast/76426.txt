in
article
center

policy
research
writes
the
first
point
to
note
regarding
the
appropriation
of
the
history
of
the
holocaust
by
zionist
propaganda
is
that
zionism
without
antisemitism
is
impossible
zionism
agrees
with
the
basic
tenet
of
antisemitism
namely
that
jews
can
not
live
with
non
jews
thats
why
the
zionists
decided
that
zion
must
be
gentilerein
what
they
didnt
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
early
zionists
actually
granted
citizenship
in
the
jewish
state
to
christian
and
muslim
people
too
it
seems
elias
that
your
first
point
to
note
is
wrong
so
the
rest
of
your
posting
isnt
worth
much
either
