i
think
some
of
these
people
have
been
too
long
on
the
net
you
are
not
going
to
convince
anyone
of
anything
through
violent
language
one
wonders
why
so
many
have
violent
tounges
i
dont
know
but
i
think
he
has
a
point
all
i
did
was
ask
a
lousy
question
and
everyone
started
calling
me
names
its
all
gotten
out
of
hand
they
start
associating
me
with
mengel
and
yassir
arafat
whom
by
the
way
i
think
is
an
idiot
gosh
guys
lighten
up
and
try
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
reasonable
i
still
dont
understand
what

been
so
antisemitic
about
the
stuff
i
posted
i
think
you
guys
are
just
looking
to
get
offended
and
in
that
sense
need
to
get
a
life
