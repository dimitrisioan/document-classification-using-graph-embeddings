news
you
may
have
missed
apr
not
because
you
were
too
busy
but
because
israelists
in
the
us
media
spiked
it
those
intrepid
israeli
soldiers
israeli
soldiers
have
sexually
taunted
arab
women
in
the
occupied
gaza
strip
during
the
threeweeklong
closure
that
has
sealed
palestinians
off
from
the
jewish
state
palestinian
sources
said
on
sunday
the
incidents
occurred
in
the
town
of
khan
younis
and
involved
soldiers
of
the
golani
brigade
who
have
been
at
the
centre
of
housetohouse
raids
for
palestinian
activists
during
the
closure
which
was
imposed
on
the
strip
and
occupied
west
bank
if
you
are
as
revolted
at
this
as
i
am
drop
israels
best
friend
email
and
let
him
know
what
you
think
via
compuserve
via
america
online
via
mci
mail
tell
em
arf
sent
ya
if
you
are
tired
of
learning
about
american
foreign
policy
from
what
is
effectively
israeli
controlled
media
i
highly
recommend
checking
out
the
washington
report
a
free
sample
copy
is
available
by
calling
the
american
education
trust
at
tell
em
arf
sent
you
js
i
took
your
advice
and
ordered
a
copy
of
the
washinton
report
i
heartily
recommend
it
to
all
proisrael
types
for
the
following
reasons
it
is
an
excellent
absorber
of
excrement
i
use
it
to
line
the
bottom
of
my
parakeets
cage
a
negative
side
effect
is
that
my
bird
now
has
a
somewhat
warped
view
of
the
mideast
it
makes
a
great
april
fools
joke
ie
give
it
to
someone
who
knows
nothing
about
the
middle
east
and
then
say
april
fools
clearly
if
a
chutzpa
reacts
this
way
it
must
be
worth
reading
by
more
objective
types
you
are
so
wrapped
up
in
your
hate
that
you
cant
even
take
the
time
to
edit
out
my
long
posting
thanks
for
the
extra
milege
by
reposting
it
