lets
check
it
out
on
page
of
this
turkishsuggested
reference
under
subtitle
deportation
and
massacre
of
turkish
armenians
it
states
several
authors
assert
that
armenian
resistance
at
van
constituted
a
key
factor
in
the
turkish
evacuation
of
persia
and
motivated
the
ittihadist
young
turk
leaders
to
annihilate
the
turkish
armenians
the
question
of
responsibility
for
the
massacres
or
deportation
of
nearly
all
ottoman
armenians
has
evolved
into
a
polemic
hundreds
of
books
articles
and
documents
have
been
published
to
describe
the
horrifying
scenes
of
violence
and
death
many
writers
such
as
the
british
bryce
and
toynbee
french
pinon
german
lepsius
american
morganthau
and
gibbons
have
insisted
that
the
massacres
were
predetermined
and
ruthlessly
executed
the
have
refuted
the
ottoman
governments
official
publications
and
justifications
by
substantiating
that
antiarmenian
measures
were
deliberated
by
the
ittihadists
even
before
the
outbreak
of
war
the
fact
remains
than
an
estimated
eight
hundred
thousand
to
over
a
million
armenians
perished
within
a
few
months
and
several
hundred
thousand
more
succumbed
in
the
following
years

few
people
know
of
the
problem
i
faced
at
ucla
when
professor
stanford
shaw
was
due
for
promotion
i
knew
him
to
be
turkeys
man
due
to
my
reading
knowledge
of
turkish
and
my
seniority
over
him
i
was
a
member
of
the
promotion
committee
for
that
case
i
sat
down
and
read
his
entire
treatise
history
of
the
ottoman
empire
and
modern
turkey
it
took
me
three
months
and
i
found
out
from
volume
i
that
he
had
plagiarized
uzun
jarsoglu
an
eminent
turkish
specialist
on
ottoman
history
shaw
himself
claimed
in
his
introduction
that
his
treatise
was
the
outcome
of
a
year
search
through
the
ottoman
archives
well
i
went
on
leave
and
managed
to
show
of
volume
i
containing
around
sentences
to
be
the
result
of
plagiarism
matching
each
sentence
with
passages
from
the
original
work
he
had
even
reproduced
the
errors
so
i
produced
a
pages
manuscript
and
submitted
a
pages
report
on
shaws
plagiarism
the
university
however
rejected
my
report
and
after
a
closed
meeting
promoted
stanford
shaw
to
distinguished
professor
i
paid
a
price
for
all
this
upset
by
the
whole
process
i
confronted
the
entire
university
structure
and
was
considered
to
be
a
chauvinist
and
madman
i
asked
for
permission
to
run
a
seminar
on
shaws
book
that
was
denied
by
the
president
of
the
university
while
the
center
for
near
eastern
studies
granted
me
permission
the
president
was
depriving
me
of
my
academic
freedom
luckily
the
dean
refused
to
give
in
and
i
did
run
the
seminar
attended
by
more
than
academic
people
in
which
i
uncovered
stanford
shaw
who
refused
to
attend
as
a
punishment
the
university
froze
all
