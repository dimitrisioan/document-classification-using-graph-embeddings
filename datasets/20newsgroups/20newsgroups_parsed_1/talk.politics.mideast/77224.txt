re
the
greek
authorities
deny
even
the
existence
of
a
turkish
minority
in
article
mau
napoleon
writes
a
few
thousand
yup
yes
there
are
a
few
thousand
left
today
after
years
of
opression
by
turkey
i
expect
better
from
you
mau
no
i
take
that
back
i
dont
the
treaty
on
the
exchange
of
the
turkish
and
greek
minorities
left
no
greek
minority
in
turkiye
except
a
few
thousand
greeks
in
istanbul
turkiye
is
no
longer
an
obstacle
for
panhellenism
although
the
material
basis
of
greek
policy
is
no
longer
visible
there
is
a
residue
which
seems
to
unite
the
pelopenisians
the
greeks
who
came
from
asia
minor
the
greeks
who
are
originally
from
the
islands
of
the
marmara
sea
or
those
who
live
in
the
numerous
aegean
islands
this
residue
is
also
recognizable
in
the
contemporary
greek
government
as
far
a
greek
turkish
wars
are
conserned
i
find
it
funny
that
a
so
informed
turk
like
you
forgot
to
mention
the
balkan
wars
not
a
chance
greece
lost
in
each
and
every
war
conducted
solely
between
greece
and
turkiye
in
the
morea
in
in
thessaly
in
and
in
anatolia
in
after
the
ottoman
empire
lost
world
war
i
the
british
landed
in
a
greek
army
in
izmir
to
exterminate
the
people
of
turkiye
are
you
suffering
from
a
severe
case
of
amnesia
the
tired
and
defeated
turks
rose
up
formed
a
national
force
under
the
leadership
of
mustafa
kemal
and
on
august
they
annihilated
the
bulk
of
the
greek
army
turkiye
is
no
longer
an
obstacle
for
panhellenism
besides
greece
lost
in
each
and
every
war
conducted
solely
between
greece
and
turkiye
in
the
morea
in
in
thessaly
in
and
in
anatolia
in
especially
the
greek
defeat
referred
to
as
the
tragedy
of
anatolia
by
the
greeks
had
momentous
effects
on
greek
mind
and
behaviour
i
find
it
curious
that
a
historian
like
you
forgot
the
wars
that
demolished
the
ottoman
empire
i
love
people
who
dont
read
and
then
spout
myths
as
evidence
where
were
greeks
in
and
i
guess
they
were
busy
with
greek
efforts
to
decimate
the
jewish
population
of
salonica
culminated
in
and
those
jews
who
survived
these
assaults
in
southeastern
europe
fled
particularly
to
salonica
whose
jewish
population
increased
substantially
as
a
result
from
in
to
in
more
than
half
the
total
population
though
even
there
increased
persecution
by
local
greeks
led
many
jews
to
flee
elsewhere
in
the
ottoman
empire
particularly
to
the
great
port
of
izmir
despite
all
the
pressure
from
ottomans
and
foreign
jews
alike
the
ritual
murders
and
other
assaults
by
christians
on
jews
went
on
and
on
greek
efforts
to
decimate
the
jewish
population
of
salonica
culminated
in
and
following
greek
conquest
of
salonica
during
the
first
balkan
war
when
many
of
its
jews
were
either
killed
or
terrorized
into
leaving
though
greece
was
obligated
by
the
post
world
war
i
treaties
to
allow
jews
and
other
minorities
to
use
their
own
languages
in
education
and
to
practice
their
religions
without
hindrance
a
law
was
issued
in
which
forbad
all
inhabitants
from
working
on
sunday
stimulating
a
new
jewish
exodus
as
it
was
intended
to
do
between
and
there
was
a
series
of
antisemitic
riots
in
salonica
with
the
cambel
quarter
where
most
of
the
remaining
jews
lived
being
burned
to
the
ground
this
was
followed
by
regulations
requiring
the
use
of
greek
and
prohibiting
hebrew
and
judeaspanish
in
the
jewish
schools
a
start
was
made
also
on
expropriating
the
land
of
the
principal
jewish
cemetery
in
salonica
for
use
by
the
new
university
in
order
to
derive
the
jews
out
by
killing
and
driving
out
large
numbers
of
jews
the
greeks
left
a
substantial
greek
majority
in
the
city
for
the
first
time
and
starting
salonica
jewry
on
the
way
to
its
final
decimation
by
the
nazis
during
the
occupation
of
greece
starting
in
salonica
and
izmir
of
course
were
not
the
only
places
of
refuge
for
jewish
refugees
entering
the
empire
during
its
last
century
of
existence
istanbul
edirne
and
other
parts
of
rumelia
and
anatolia
received
thousands
more
nor
were
jews
the
only
refugees
received
and
helped
by
the
government
of
the
sultan
thousands
of
muslims
accompanied
them
in
flight
from
similar
persecutions
wherever
balkan
christian
states
gained
independence
or
expanded
the
russian
conquest
of
the
crimea
and
the
caucasus
starting
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
and
particularly
during
and
after
the
crimean
war
combined
with
the
same
independence
movements
in
southeastern
europe
that
had
caused
so
much
suffering
and
flight
among
its
jews
caused
thousands
of
helpless
ill
and
povertystricken
muslim
refugees
to
accompany
them
into
the
ever
shrinking
boundaries
of
the
ottoman
empire
with
the
istanbul
government
struggling
mightly
but
vainly
to
house
and
feed
them
as
best
it
could
from
to
as
many
as
crimean
tatars
circassians
and
other
muslims
from
north
and
east
of
the
black
sea
had
entered
anatolia
alone
as
many
as
more
came
during
the
next
twenty
years
while
refugees
entered
in
as
a
result
of
the
ottoman
wars
with
russia
and
the
balkan
states
with
an
equal
number
gaining
refuge
in
the
european

of
