what
is
a
shame
is
that
in
austria
daily
reports
of
the
inhuman
acts
commited
by
israeli
soldiers
and
the
blessing
received
from
the
government
makes
some
of
the
holocaust
guilt
go
away
after
all
look
how
the
jews
are
treating
other
races
when
they
got
power
it
is
unfortunate
this
can
be
turned
around
the
austrians
who
should
feel
guilty
about
their
actions
during
wwii
but
dont
justify
their
antisemetism
by
making
every
israeli
action
into
an
atrocity
the
austrians
germans
and
other
europeans
have
extensive
trading
relations
with
the
arab
block
being
proarab
is
good
for
business
i
dont
think
that
ethics
has
a
thing
to
do
about
it
