roy
bullock
wanted
to
be
a
spy
since
he
was
a
teenager
in
indiana
and
read

led
three
lives
herbert
philbricks
cold

saga
of
penetrating
the
communist
party
for
the
fbi
philbrick
had
become
an
american
folk
hero
in
the
s
for
building
dossiers
on
unsuspecting
colleagues
it
was
a
time
when
hollywood
produced
more
than
films
portraying
the
informer
as
the
quintessential
american
patriot
in
boston
where
philbrick
led
three
lives
as
an
fbi
informant
communist
party
member
and
private
citizen
the
mayor
even
proclaimed
a
herbert
philbrick
day
and
presented
the
spy
with
a
plaque
for
bullock
a
shy
young
man
who
was
coming
to
terms
with
his
homosexuality
in
the
straightarrow
s
the
life
of
a
double
agent
was
the
perfect
way
to
hide
his
lifestyle
while
fighting
the
communist
menace
i
was
fascinated
with
herbert
philbrick
bullock
recently
told
federal
investigators
and
so
i
thought
i
would
try
to
infiltrate
the
communist
part
in

went
to
the
sixth
world
youth
and
student
festival
in
moscow
with
the
american

gave
them
the
fbi
a
full
report
on
it
when
i
returned
along
with
some
photos
i
took
of
some
soviet
military
vehicles
bullock
was
hooked
for
the
next
two
years
he
worked
as
an
unpaid
informant
for
the
fbi
but
he
found
his
true
calling
when
he
became
a
paid
spy
for
the
antidefamation
league
in
now
his
activities
are
at
the
center
of
the
biggest
domestic
spy
scandal
in
recent
american
history
a
scandal
that
may
end
with
the
adls
criminal
indictment
in
san

over
a
year
period
he
compiled
computer

for
the

when
he
visited
the
bay
area
in

sold
many
of

meanwhile
between

nearly
using
a
prominent
beverly

as
a
conduit
in
order
to
conceal
its
financial
relationship
with
bullock
last
month
police
raided
adl
offices
in
los

and
san
francisco
as
well
as
bullocks
home
confiscating
computer
files
and
boxes
of

according
to
court

bullocks
files
contained
the

information
in
addition
to
criminal
histories
on
individuals
much
of
which
was
allegedly
stolen
from
the
fbi
and
police
computers
bullock
told
the
fbi
that
copies
of
virtually
everything
in
his
computer
data
base
had
been
given
to
the
san
francisco
adl
office
based
on
the
evidence
says
inspector
ron
roth
in
a
police
affidavit
i
believe
that
roy
bullock
and
adl
had
numerous
peace
officers
supplying
them
with
confidential
criminal
and
dmv
information
whats
more
the
san

da
is
investigating
bullock
for
tapping
phones
accessing
answering
machines
and
assuming
false
identities
to
infiltrate
organizations
documents
seized
from
bullocks
home
also
contained
evidence
of
his
forays
into
bay
area
trash
cans
he
had
the
names
and
phone
numbers
of
employees
at
the

numbers
of

office
correspondence
listing
the

and

federal
savings
as
well
as
itemized
canceled

with

the

and

bullock
even
knew
the
balance
in
the
christic
institutes
checking
account
investigations
by
the
fbi
and
police
in
san
francisco
have
revealed
that
the
adl
has
shared
at
least
some
of
its
spy
gathering
material
with
israeli
government
officials
whats
more
israel
apparently
used
tips
from
the
adl
to
detain
palestinian
americans
who
travelled
there
the
adl
was
established
in
new
york
city
in
to
defend
jews
and
later
other
minority
groups
from
discrimination
it
led
the
fight
against
racist
and
fascist
groups
like
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
american
nazi
party
and
in
the
s
championed
the
civil
rights
movement
but
there
was
also
a
darker
side
in
the
late
s
the
adl
spied
on
leftists
and
communists
and
shared
investigative
files
with
the
house
committee
on
unamerican
activities
and
the
fbi
the
adl
swung
sharply
to
the
right
during
the
reagan
administration
becoming
a
bastion
of
neoconservatism
to
irwin
suall
a
repentant
trotskyite
who
heads
the
adls
powerful
fact
finding
department
the
real
danger
to
jews
is
posed
not
by
the
right
but
by
a
coalition
of
leftists
blacks
and
arabs
who
in
his
view
threaten
the
fabric
of
democracy
in
america
as
well
as
the
state
of
israel
in
the
tradition
of
his
ideological
soulmate
william
casey
suall
directed
the
adls
vast
network
of
informants
who
were
given
code
names
like
scumbag
ironside
and
for
a
spy
reportedly
posing
as
a
priest
in
atlanta
flipper
for
years
journalists
and
liberal
members
of
the
jewish
community
knew
the
adl
spied
on
rightwing
hate
groups
as
long
as
the
targets
were
antisemitic
organizations
like
the
liberty
lobby
and
lyndon
larouche
no
one
seemed
to
be
particularly
troubled
but
the
bullock
case
reveals
that
the
adl
also
spied
on
groups
that
have
a
nonviolent
and
progressive
orientation
this
apparent
massive
violation
of
civil
liberties
may
end
with
the
adls
criminal
indictment
in
san
francisco
where
the
investigation
began
the
human
rights
group
faces
possible
criminal
prosecution
on
as
many
as
felony
counts
including
an
indictment
for
gaining
illegal
access
to
police
computers
says
one
source
close
to
the
west
coast
investigation
it
is
per
cent
certain
that
the
adl
will
be
indicted
in
the
wake
of
the
san
francisco
investigation
police
probes
of
adl
spying
are
spreading
to
other
parts
of
the
country
we
have
received
numerous
complaints
about
adl
spying
says
sam
adams
a
spokesperson
for
the
mayors
office
in
portland
oregon
on
april
the
harlembased
black
united
fund
of
new
york
and
african
american
selfhelp
group
that
bullock
allegedly
spied
on
wrote
district
attorney
robert
morgenthau
requesting
an
immediate
investigation
of
the
adl
the
adls
actions
cause
great
concern
as
it
is
a
direct
and
flagrant
violation
at
minimum
of
our
civil
rightswe
call
upon
you
to
join
with
the
district
attorney
of
san
francisco
tobring
and
end
to
this
latest
form
of
mccarthyism
gerald
mckelvey
a
spokesperson
for
morgenthaus
office
says
we
have
no
evidence
before
us
that
warrants
any
sort
of
investigation
mckelvey
adds
that
morgenthau
offered
to
assist
the
fbi
and
the
san
francisco
das
office
on
their
pending
investigation
they
have
not
so
far
asked
for
our
assistance
the
adl
acknowledges
sharing
information
on
violenceprone
groups
with
law
enforcement
officials
it
also
admits
to
maintaining
extensive
files
on
a
wide
variety
of
organizations
but
says
in
a
twopage
press
release
the
vast
majority
of
adls
files
are
composed
of
news
clips
magazine
articles
books
journals
and
other
documents
adl
has
made
it
clear
that
it
does
not
and
will
not
countenance
violations
of
the
law
on
the
part
of
anyone
connected
with
the
agency
and
the
process
by
which
the
league
gathers
information
is
presently
under
review
to
insure
that
no
laws
are
being
violated
thats
what
the
adl
says
for
public
consumption
but
morale
is
so
low
that
its
employees
complain
of
sleepless
nights
and
crying
fits
and
even
as
other
jewish
groups
circle
the
wagons
around
the
adl
in
a
show
of
solidarity
many
do
so
holding
their
noses
more
than
a
few
jewish
officials
privately
say
the
adl
has
to
decide
whether
it
is
a
human
rights
group
or
a
secret
police
agency
the
adl
is
regarded
both
inside
the
jewish
community
and
outside
the
jewish
community
as
the
definitive
source
of
information
on
anti
semitism
and
extremist
groups
says
daniel
levitas
the
former
executive
director
of
the
center
for
democratic
renewal
an
atlanta
based
group
that
monitors
antisemitism
racism
and
hate
groups
one
of
the
things
this
scandal
has
done
is
that
it
has
completely
tainted
the
adls
credibility
and
reputation
with
regard
to
its
objectivity
this
scandal
is
going
to
be
a
devastating
blow
to
the
jewish
community
at
large
because
people
regard
the
adl
as
synonymous
with
american
jewry
bullocks
talents
as
a
snoop
and
his
extreme
conservatism
meshed
well
with
the
adls
cold
war
worldview
in
he
moved
to
southern
california
where
he
became
an
adl
spy
for
a
week
bullock
almost
always
used
his
real
name
when
snooping
although
he
once
called
himself
elmer
fink
when
corresponding
with
supporters
of
alabama
governor
george
wallace
bullock
provided
the
adls
office
in
los
angeles
with
written
reports
which
were
transmitted
to
fact
finding
department
head
irwin
suall
according
to
court
records
under
sualls
stewardship
fact
finding
department
had
become
the
adls
heart
and
soul
located
at
adl
national
headquarters
across
from
the
united
nations
the
department
had
assembled
a
vast
library
on
hate
groups
culling
material
from
publications
speeches
and
informants
reports
bullock
was
more
than
adept
at
leading
a
double
life
not
long
after
moving
to
california
he
ingratiated
himself
with
a
woman
in
the
john
birch
society
who
helped
him
gain
access
to
the
groups
boston
office
there
he
found
a
file
the
rightwingers
were
keeping
on
the
adl
the
discovery
gave
rise
to
speculation
in
the
adl
new
york
office
that
they
had
somehow
been
penetrated
by
the
birchers
bullock
focused
almost
exclusively
on
rightwing
extremist
groups
until
the
early
s
when
adl
la
head
milton
sinn
was
replaced
by
harvey
schechter
who
encouraged
him
to
target
the
left
as
well
a
few
years
later
bullock
moved
to
the
castro
district
in
san
francisco
where
he
posed
as
an
art
dealer
and
adl
fact
finder
who
had
infiltrated
the
local
arab
community
had
just
been
exposed
when
the
ensuing
scandal
died
down
bullock
was
ordered
by
the
adl
to
penetrate
the
arabs
the
adl
was
especially
concerned
about
the
americanarab
anti
discrimination
committee
founded
by
the
former
south
dakota
senator
james
abourezk
to
combat
arabbashing
in
a
page
out
of
the
cias
dirty
tricks
handbook
on
penetration
and
destabilization
bullock
joined
the
adc
and
then
recruited
nazis
into
the
group
apparently
trying
to
discredit
it
according
to
published
reports
in
the
adl
sent
bullock
to
attend
the
national
association
of
arab
americans
annual
congress
in
washington
according
to
court
documents
bullock
was
told
to
find
the
source
of
the
groups
funds
bullock
was
unable
to
follow
the
money
but
he
did
such
a
good
job
at
ingratiating
himself
that
he
was
appointed
to
head
a
naaa
delegation
that
visited
congress
member
nancy
pelosi
its
not
surprising
that
the
adl
penetrated
arab
organizations
but
only
acute
paranoia
explains
their
interest
in
groups
like
act
up
as
far
as
bullock
was
concerned
gay
groups
in
san
francisco
were
heavily
infiltrated
by
what
he
called
gay
left
revolutionaries
prompting
him
to
write
about
their
activities
for
the
adl
bullock
soon
expanded
his
horizons
moving
into
the
shadowy
realm
of
foreign
espionage
after
richard
hirschhaut
the
head
of
adls
san
francisco
office
introduced
him
to
thomas
gerard
in
gerard
was
then
a
detective
with
the
san
francisco
police
departments
intelligence
unit
gerard
had
worked
as
a
demolitions
expert
for
the
cia
in
el
salvador
in
the
early
s
where
he
apparently
had
more
than
a
passing
interest
in
rightwing
death
squads
police
searching
gerards
briefcase
found
extensive
cia
literature
about
torture
and
interrogation
photos
of
blindfolded
and
chained
men
as
well
as
passports
made
out
to
gerard
in
different
names
including
thomas
clouseau
from
a
remote
jungle
island
redoubt
in
the
philippines
where
he
fled
last
november
gerard
told
the
los
angeles
times
that
he
will
blow
the
lid
off
the
cias
involvement
with
latin
american
death
squads
if
he
is
indicted
in
the
adl
spy
case
after
their
very
first
encounter
in
the
adl
office
gerard
and
bullock
had
lunch
at
mcdonalds
i
liked
tom
right
off
bullock
later
told
a
san
francisco
police
investigator
whose
report
of
the
interrogation
was
obtained
by
the
voice
tom
is
a
very
charming
roguish
character
with
a
great
deal
of
integrity
let
me
say
here
i
consider
tom
gerard
one
of
the
finest
policemen
ive
ever
worked
with
absolutely
honest
capable
intelligent
and
percent
american
before
long
bullock
was
providing
gerard
with
confidential
adl
reports
on
various
groups
and
individuals
in
turn
gerard
gave
bullock
classified
police
intelligence
files
on
local
arab
americans
skinheads
and
others
bullock
told
the
fbi
that
gerards
material
ended
up
in
his
adl
reports
i
would
say
percent
of
the
data
that
i
got
was
name
address
and
sometimes
physical
description
criminal
history
very
rarely
bullock
told
investigators
gerard
also
gave
bullock
a
chart
that
outlined
a
vast
network
of
bay
area
arab
american
businessmen
and
organizations
that
allegedly
has
ties
to
middle
east
terror
groups
as
well
as
surveillance
photos
of
arab
americans
receiving
weapons
training
overseas
bullock
claims
that
us
customs
in
new
york
gave
gerard
the
photos
it
was
understood
that
bullock
would
be
very
careful
with
what
he
did
with
the
information
gerard
gave
him
and
that
bullock
would
not
release
it
except
to
the
adl
or
other
law
enforcement
officers
says
an
fbi
report
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
bullocks
cozy
relationship
with
law
enforcement
by
the
mids
the
adl
was
swapping
files
with
hundreds
of
official
friends
the
organizations
euphemism
for
us
law
enforcement
and
intelligence
sources
the
adls
relationship
with
the
fbis
counterterrorism
office
was
so
close
that
adls
reports
on
arab
american
groups
covert
ties
to
middle
east
terrorists
were
must
reading
its
no
accident
that
police
found
a
classified
fbi
report
entitled
popular
front
for
the
liberation
of
palestine
pflpnew
york
area
while
searching
the
adls
san

office
in
adl
spooks
investigated
seven
palestinians
and
a
kenyan
studying
in
california
universities
on
student
visas
when
the
adl
discovered
they
were
disseminating
pflp
literature
it
informed
the
fbi
which
in
turn
took
the
case
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
after
the
ins
ordered
the
students
deported
as
subversives
adl
regional
director
david
lehrer
gloated
in
the
los

times
about
his
offices
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
although
hes
backpedaling
now
the
los

deportation
is
still
under
appeal
while
the
adl
worked
quietly
with
americas
top
cops
it
enjoyed
similar
ties
with
israels
spy
agencies
a
charge
that
adl
leaders
vehemently
deny
but
as
early
as

pollard
later
wrote
to
friends
that
a
prominent
adl
leader
was
deeply
involved
in
the
israeli
spy
operation
while
there
is
no
proof
that
anyone
connected
with
the
adl
was
involved
with
pollard
there
is
evidence
that
the
adl
freely
passes
information
to
israeli
intelligence
in
march
the
fbi
interrogated
david
gurvitz
an
adl
fact
finder
in
los
angeles
until
when
he
was
fired
by
suall
for
illegally
obtaining
police
information
to
use
against
a
rival
at
the
simon
wiesenthal
center
the
fbi
pointedly
asked
gurvitz
if
he
had
ever
transmitted
information
to
israel
gurvitz
admitted
that
in
he
had
learned
from
a
law
enforcement
contact
that
michael
elias
allegedly
a
member
of
a
radical
plo
faction
was
scheduled
to
travel
from
san
francisco
international
airport
en
route
to
haifa
gurvitz
phoned
the
deputy
israeli
consul
general
in
la
with
the
information
later
the
same
day
according
to
a
page
fbi
interview
of
gurvitz
obtained
by
the
voice
gurvitz
was
called
back
by
another
man
who
said
he
was
from
the
israeli
consulate
and
who
asked
gurvitz
to
repeat
the
information
about
elias
gurvitz
did
not
get
this
mans
name
but
their
conversation
was
in
hebrew
so
gurvitz
felt
confident
the
man
was
actually
an
israeli
consulate
official
among
the
names
of
private
citizens
that
police
found
in
adl
files
in
san
francisco
was
mohammed
jarad
a
yearold
chicago
resident
who
was
arrested
in
israel
on
january
for
allegedly
distributing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
hamas
the
large
islamic
fundamentalist
movement
in
the
occupied
territories
the
chicago
adl
office
runs
at
least
three
undercover
informants
who
work
with
official
friends
in
local
law
enforcement
according
to
documents
released
by
the
san
francisco
da
and
sources
close
to
the
adl
given
these
facts
arab
american
groups
surmise
that
the
adl
has
passed
information
on
jarad
to
israeli
intelligence
one
technique
used
by
the
adl
to
monitor
the
large
arab
american
community
in
the
midwest
was
to
scan
the
local
arab
press
for
funeral
notices
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
practice
adl
investigators
in
unmarked
vans
videotaped
the
palestinian
funerals
which
sometimes
turned
into
plo
rallies
palestinians
have
been
detained
at
bengurion
airport
simply
on
the
basis
of
having
been
filmed
attending
a
funeral
in
chicago
according
to
suhail
miari
the
executive
director
of
the
united
holy
land
fund
whose
cousin
was
an
arab
member
of
israels
knesset
shortly
after
jarad
was
arrested
the
israeli
government
announced
that
hamas
was
being
run
from
america
with
money
and
operational
instructions
relayed
by
courier
or
fax
israels
charges
were
played
up
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times
according
to
well
placed
sources
yehudit
barsky
an
adl
fact
finder
in
new
york
worked
closely
with
israeli
officials
on
this
campaign
of
vilification
introducing
friendly
reporters
to
official
friends
in
chicago
law
enforcement
barsky
who
is
fluent
in
arabic
prepared
an
adl
report
about
how
hamas
is
funded
in
america
she
identified
the
dallasbased
islamic
association
for
palestine
in
north
america
as
the
front
organization
for
hamas
in
the
usa
its
infrastructure
functions
as
an
interlocking
network
of
organizations
small
businesses
and
individual
activists
says
the
february
adl
report
which
outlines
the
organizations
development
its
activities
on
us
college
campuses
and
its
metamorphosis
during
the
gulf
war
it
also
traces
hamas
fundraising
through
a
plethora
of
alleged
front
groups
from
plainfield
indiana
to
culver
city
california
it
is
doubtful
that
barsky
could
have
compiled
such
sophisticated
data
without
the
help
of
official
friends
and
adl
spies
barsky
refused
to
comment
but
she
used
to
talk
to
greg
slabodkin
as
many
as
three
times
a
week
when
he
was
an
opposition
researcher
for
aipac
whose
spy
operation
was
disclosed
last
summer
in
the
voice
the
level
of
cooperation
was
very
close
slabodkin
said
during
a
recent
phone
conservation
from
israel
where
he
is
in
graduate
school
if
we
felt
our
files
were
lacking
we
contacted
the
adl
when
shawan
jabarin
a
yearold
palestinian
human
rights
worker
in
the
occupied
territories
won
a
reebok
human
rights
award
in
slabodkin
recalls
that
barsky
faxed
aipac
the
mans
entire
police
file
which
she
had
obtained
from
the
israeli
embassy
jabarin
had
been
arrested
numerous
times
in
israel
and
once
confessed
to
being
a
member
of
the
plo
after
having
been
severely
tortured
jabarin
who
received
a
short
jail
term
became
an
amnesty
international
prisoner
of
conscience
of
course
to
aipac
and
the
adl
jabarin
was
a
terrorist
slabodkin
who
was
ordered
to
keep
tabs
on
him
when
he
was
in
the
us
to
receive
his
award
called
a
representative
of
al
haq
the
palestinian
human
rights
group
that
employed
jabarin
to
obtain
his
itinerary
aipac
even
opened
a
file
on
musician
jackson
browne
who
presented
jabarin
with
the
reebok
award
while
the
adl
may
be
able
to
rationalize
its
close
monitoring
of
arabs
and
even
leftwing
gay
revolutionaries
it
has
a
far
harder
time
explaining
its
obsession
with
spying
on
antiapartheid
activists
david
gurvitz
told
the
fbi
that
when
he
started
working
as
a
fact
finder
for
the
adl
in
la
in
march
adl
files
already
bulged
with
information
about
the
israelsouth
african
connection
and
anti
apartheid
groups
gurvitz
confirmed
that
the
adl
did
routinely
collect
information
on
persons
engaged
in
antiapartheid
activities
in
the
united
states
says
the
fbi
report
while
gurvitz
said
there
were
files
in
the
la
adl
office
dating
to
the
s
he
estimated
the
oldest
material
on
antiapartheid
activities
dates
back
to
the
late
s
paralleling
begins
rise
to
power
in
israel
and
a
deepening
of
ties
between
the
jewish
state
and
south
africa
in
about
august
says
the
report
of
the
fbis
march
interview
with
gurvitz
an
antiapartheid
demonstration
was
held
at
the
south
african
consulate
in
los
angeles
participating
in
the
demonstration
were
the
los
angeles
student
coalition
and
the
socialist
workers
party
gurvitz
went
to
two
demonstration
planning
sessions
and
a
subsequent
demonstration
he
wrote
a
report
for
the
adl
on
each
of
the
planning
sessions
and
on
the
demonstration
copies
of
the
reports
were
disseminated
to
bullock
among
others
in
care
of
the
san
francisco
adl
office
in
bullock
learned
that
the
consul
general
of
the
south
african
consulate
in
los
angeles
would
be
speaking
in
las
vegas
at
a
meeting
organized
by
willis
carto
the
head
of
the
antisemitic
liberty
lobby
suspecting
that
the
consul
general
did
not
know
who
willis
carto
is
says
the
fbi
report
bullock
suggested
to
gerard
that
they
might
want
to
warn
the
south
africans
gerard
agreed
and
informed
the
consul
general
who
canceled
his
appearance
a
few
months
later
gerard
phoned
bullock
and
told
him
a
south
african
intelligence
officer
wanted
to
meet
them
during
a
rendezvous
in
a
hotel
near
fishermans
wharf
the
south
african
said
he
was
interested
in
acquiring
information
on
american
antiapartheid
activists
the
south
african
who
called
himself
mr
humphries
also
asked
for
information
about
groups
that
were
advocating
divestments
gerard
who
was
present
throughout
the
meeting
says
the
fbi
report
told
humphries
that
he
gerard
had
been
employed
by
the
ciahumphries
offered
to
pay
bullock
per
month
in
exchange
for
information
bullock
noted
that
much
of
the
information
humphries
said
he
wanted
was
already
in
the
possession
of
bullock
and
the
adl
between
and
bullock
sold
information
to
south
african
intelligence
receiving
steady
raises
which
he
split
evenly
with
gerard
bullock
said
it
was
his
impression
though
gerard
never
explicitly
told
him
so
and
bullock
never
asked
that
gerard
may
have
been
telling
the
cia
about
his
and
bullocks
contacts
with
the
south
africans
says
the
fbi
report
gerard
had
said
he
knew
the
cia
resident
agent
in
san
franciscoonce
after
gerard
dropped
bullock
off
at
bullocks
residence
following
a
meeting
with
louie
who
replaced
humphries
as
their
handler
gerard
said
he
was
going
to
go
to
the
san
francisco
cia
office
al
the
while
gerard
may
have
been
tasking
bullock
for
the
cia
bullock
recalled
that
once
after
he
had
met
gerard
bullock
went
to
chicago
illinois
to
conduct
an
investigation
on
behalf
of
the
adl
says
the
fbi
report
the
target
of
the
investigation
was
a
group
called
the
palestine
human
rights
campaign
bullock
learned
that
a
woman
name
deleted
was
transporting
money
between
the
plo
or
the
pflp
and
the
united
states
bullock
told
this
to
gerard
gerard
later
told
bullock
that
gerards
guy
at
the
cia
would
like
to
know
more
gerard
asked
bullock
if
bullock
would
go
back
to
chicago
to
gather
more
information
on
the
palestine
human
rights
campaign
bullock
however
never
did
go
back
gerard
also
seems
to
have
had
a
close
relationship
with
mossad
which
may
have
started
in
when
he
went
on
an
adl
junket
to
israel
the
adl
frequently
sponsors
trips
for
american
law
enforcement
officials
to
israel
where
they
are
wined
and
dined
and
meet
their
counterparts
in
various
intelligence
agencies
according
to
an
affidavit
by
san
francisco
police
inspector
roth
the
allexpense
paid
trip
to
israel
was
more
or
less
a
thankyou
gift
and
a
liaison
gesture
by
the
adl
to
continue
the
close
relationships
it
has
with
specific
law
enforcement
officers
from
the
united
states
gerard
may
have
liked
what
he
saw
in
israel
a
short
time
after
travelling
there
he
went
to
addis
ababa
where
he
helped
with
mossads
rescue
of
ethiopian
jews
as
gerards
relationship
with
south
africa
deepened
he
talked
more
openly
about
his
exploits
in
the
cia
bullock
recalled
gerard
mentioning
that
he
had
been
in
algeria
on
cia
business
and
that
gerard
discussed
the
plo
and
safehouses
says
the
fbi
report
to
this
louie
once
responded
that
israeli
intelligence
had
determined
that
the
plo
and
the
african
national
congress
were
cooperating
gerard
also
spoke
of
having
travelled
with
the
cia
to
afghanistan
louie
also
told
gerard
and
bullock
about
his
adventures
inside
south
africa
as
an
intelligence
officer
both
gerard
and
louie
traded
war
stories
and
regaled
each
other
and
bullock
with
tales
of
narrow
scrapes
although
there
is
still
much
mystery
about
what
triggered
law
enforcements
investigation
of
the
adl
it
was
probably
the
theft
of
a
classified
fbi
report
on
the
nation
of
islam
from
the
fbis
san
francisco
office
police
armed
with
search
warrants
recovered
the
report
in
the
adl
san
francisco
office
gurvitz
says
he
had
sent
a
copy
of
it
to
mira
boland
the
director
of
the
adls
fact
finding
division
in
washington
dc
boland
was
preparing
an
oped
piece
for
the
washington
times
in
which
she
argued
that
the
nation
of
islam
should
not
receive
federal
funds
for
the
reconstruction
of
la
because
the
group
is
antisemitic
and
violenceprone
boland
who
had
arranged
the
adl
police
junket
to
israel
attended
by
gerard
testified
in
a
criminal
trial
in
roanoke
virginia
that
she
had
worked
for
the
cia
for
months
and
later
was
a
subcontractor
for
the
defense
department
before
joining
the
adl
during
the
trial
boland
admitted
to
sharing
information
with
a
cia
official
at
an
invitation
only
adl
conference
after
he
was
questioned
by
the
fbi
last
fall
gerard
fled
to
the
philippines
which
has
no
extradition
treaty
with
america
gerard
is
believed
to
have
supplied
information
from
police
computers
not
only
to
the
adl
but
to
israel
and
south
africa
as
well
the
san
francisco
examiner
reported
that
gerard
may
be
charged
with
violating
federal
espionage
laws
although
bullock
worked
for
the
adl
for
years
and
irwin
suall
praised
him
in
a
july
memo
as
our
number
one
investigator
the
adl
now
argues
that
he
was
a
rogue
agent
in
its
own
defense
the
adl
also
asserts
that
its
fact
finders
operate
no
differently
than
journalists
after
all
ask
adl
officials
dont
journalists
keep
files
but
the
difference
between
the
practice
of
journalism
and
the
adls
method
of
gathering
information
couldnt
be
more
striking
journalists
place
information
in
the
public
domain
where
they
are
held
accountable
for
falsehoods
distortions
and
libel
and
for
the
most
part
journalists
dont
share
their
investigative
files
with
foreign
and
domestic
police
agencies
the
adl
has
no
such
inhibition
because
many
of
its
files
are
not
open
to
public
scrutiny
false
information
collected
by
ideologically
biased
researchers
can
not
be
corrected
once
a
proud
human
rights
group
the
adl
has
become
the
jewish
thought
police
the
adl
says
its
a
human
rights
group
not
just
for
jews
but
for
everyone
says
chip
berlet
a
highly
respected
researcher
at
the
massachusettsbased
political
research
associates
which
monitors
rightwing
extremist
groups
thats
fine
but
it
cant
do
that
and
spy
on
palestinians
its
blatantly
unethical
and
frankly
immoral
my
argument
to
people
is
that
the
adl
wears
four
hats
each
of
the
hats
independently
is
appropriate
it
is
a
broadbased
human
rights
group
that
looks
at
the
broad
issues
of
prejudice
and
discrimination
it
is
a
group
that
defends
jews
against
defamation
entirely
noble
nothing
wrong
with
that
hat
it
is
a
group
whose
leaders
at
least
consistently
defend
the
actions
of
israel
against
its
critics
which
again
is
entirely
appropriate
and
it
is
a
group
that
maintains
an
informationsharing
arrangement
with
law
enforcement
again
there
is
nothing
wrong
for
a
group
to
do
that
but
you
cant
do
all
four
it
is
impossible
to
do
all
four
and
not
violate
the
bounds
of
ethics
theres
a
builtin
conflict
of
interest
if
you
wear
all
four
hats
adl
national
director
abraham
foxman
apparently
sees
no
such
conflict
in
a
september
letter
to
the
voice
foxman
complained
adl
has
a
proud
year
record
of
fighting
bigotry
and
promoting
civil
rights
and
constitutional
freedoms
any
imputation
of
an
effort
or
motive
on
our
part
to
smear
or
stifle
the
free
speech
of
anyone
is
false
and
baseless
throughout
his
pieces
on
aipacs
spying
friedman
describes
the
dissemination
of
information
as
if
it
were
slander
and
the
existence
of
files
as
a
token
of
mccarthyite
inclination
the
depiction
is
misleading
in
several
ways
virtually
every
journalist
academic
politician
and
organization
keeps
files
on
subjects
they
deem
relevant
tracing
the
logic
of
friedmans
reckless
charges
the
library
of
congress
is
tantamount
to
the
kgb
moreover
disseminating
the
public
record
of
a
public
figure
is
neither
defamation
nor
mccarthyism
but
many
believe
the
adl
is
increasingly
in
the
defamation
business
ask
jesse
jackson
james
abourezk
or
the
leaders
of
the
new
jewish
agenda
all
past
targets
of
adl
smears
at
the
same
time
the
adl
exonerated
the
fascist
world
anticommunist
league
which
assisted
ronald
reagans
covert
war
against
nicaragua
a
policy
endorsed
by
adl
leaders
in
the
early
s
researchers
russ
bellant
and
berlet
asked
to
meet
fact
finding
head
irwin
suall
to
discuss
their
work
on
antisemite
lyndon
larouche
our
view
then
of
irwin
suall
was
that
he
was
this
really
terrific
investigator
says
berlet
so
we
introduce
ourselves
say
what
we
are
up
to
and
suall
leans
back
in
his
chair
and
basically
runs
down
a
dossier
on
each
of
us
about
what
our
political
activities
are
who
we
work
with
what
organizations
we
belong
to
obviously
he
was
just
trying
to
blow
us
away
and
he
succeeds
admirably
we
were
just
sitting
there
with
our
mouths
open
feeling
very
uncomfortable
and
then
he
leans
forward
and
says
the
rightwing
isnt
the
problem
the
leftwing
is
the
problem
the
soviet
union
is
the
biggest
problem
in
the
world
for
jews
its
the
american
left
that
is
the
biggest
threat
to
american
jews
youre
on
the
wrong
track
youre
part
of
the
problem
we
were
stunned
i
was
virtually
in
tears
this
is
not
how
i
perceived
myself
we
basically
stumbled
out
of
there
in
a
daze

of

friedmans
assault
on
the
antidefamation
league
the
anti
defamation
league
is
spying
on
you
may
demonstrates
that
he
has
an
axe
to
grind
and
his
own
prejudiced
and
biased
agenda
to
promote
it
also
demonstrates
that
concern
for
accurate
reporting
is
far
down
on
his
list
the
story
is
replete
with
inaccuracies
innuendos
and
outright
falsehoods
and
conveys
a
picture
of
adl
so
divorced
from
reality
as
to
be
farcical
friedman
is
even
wrong
on
such
basic
easily
determined
facts
as
where
adl
was
founded
chicago
not
new
york
and
the
building
in
which
adls
san
francisco
office
is
located
not
the
jewish
community
federation
building
pictured
adl
has
done
the
work
of
fighting
haters
for
years
without
spying
on
organizations
or
individuals
and
with
profound
respect
for
the
law
our
mission
is
to
monitor
and
expose
those
who
are
anti
jewish
racist
antidemocratic
and
violenceprone
and
we
monitor
them
primarily
by
reading
publications
and
attending
public
meetings
through
the
years
we
have
published
scores
of
reports
on
anti
semitism
emanating
from
both
the
left
and
the
right
in
fact
although
friedmans
bias
leads
him
to
assume
the
contrary
adls
primary
concern
is
still
the
far
right
because
extremist
organizations
are
highly
secretive
sometimes
adl
can
learn
of
their
activities
only
by
using
undercover
sources
friedmans
hyperbole
notwithstanding
these
sources
function
in
a
manner
directly
analogous
to
investigative
journalists
some
have
performed
great
service
to
the
american
people
for
example
by
uncovering
the
existence
of
rightwing
extremist
paramilitary
training
camps
with
no
recognition
and
at
considerable
personal
risk
the
information
adl
obtains
is
placed
in
the
public
domain
and
through
the
years
adl
has
established
a
reputation
for
accurate
reporting
friedmans
article
by
contrast
contains
so
much
misinformation
that
it
would
take
an
article
equally
as
long
to
set
the
record
straight
a
few
examples
he
states
that
an
adl
leader
was
deeply
involved
in
the
jonathan
pollard
israeli
spy
operation
and
that
pollards
handlers
wife
worked
for
the
new
york
adl
as
a
lawyer
not
true
friedman
also
states
adl
investigators
in
unmarked
vans
videotaped
palestinian
funerals
not
true
elsewhere
he
asserts
that
adl
was
obsessed
with
spying
on
antiapartheid
activists
again
not
true
we
could
go
on
and
on
and
of
course
friedman
does
not
reveal
his
sources
the
distortion
games
friedman
plays
when
he
mentions
numbers
further
reveal
his
lack
of
objectivity
when
it
comes
to
how
much
adl
paid
roy
bullock
a
week
as
an
independent
contractor
not
an
employee
an
important
distinction
friedman
also
fails
to
make
he
includes
the
zeros
inviting
the
reader
to
see
a
large
number
by
contrast
when
he
observes
that
adl
paid
bullock
nearly
between
and
he
chooses
not
to
point
out
that
amounts
to
little
more
than
a
year
hardly
an
excessive
sum
what
is
accurate
about
friedmans
story
is
chip
berlets
description
of
adls
four
hats
yes
adl
looks
at
broad
issues
of
prejudice
and
discrimination
yes
adl
defends
israel
against
critics
and
yes
adl
maintains
an
informationsharing
relationship
with
law
enforcement
regarding
extremist
activities
and
hate
crimes
we
see
no
conflict
in
these
four
activities
and
we
believe
most
voice
readers
wont

abraham

league
manhattan
robert
i
friedman
replies
for
the
adl
to
compare
itself
to
investigative
journalists
is
absurd
journalists
dont
spy
on
arabs
and
antiapartheid
activists
and
then
freely
pass
their
files
to
south
african
and
israeli
intelligence
but
according
to
police
the
confessions
of
two
paid
adl
investigators
buttressed
by
pages
of
court
documents
and
interviews
the
adl
does
indeed
the
adl
spies
on
groups
that
are
neither
antisemitic
nor
violent
police
confiscated
adl
files
on
hundreds
of
mainstream
groups
ranging
from
act
up
to
peace
now
respected
intellectuals
and
middle
east
scholars
who
disagree
with
the
adls
political
views
have
ended
up
on
adl
blacklists
their
reputations
smeared
private
organizations
have
no
business
paying
operatives
inside
police
departments
or
having
spies
says
an
april
editorial
in
the
st
louis
postdispatch
condemning
adl
spying
on
april
police
armed
with
search
warrants
raided
adl
offices
in
san
francisco
and
la
after
concluding
that
adl
employees
were
apparently
less
than
truthful
in
voluntarily
turning
over
documents
during
an
earlier
search
according
to
san
francisco
police
inspector
ron
roths
sworn
affidavit
roth
also
asserts
that
bullock
was
a
paid
employee
for
the
adl
if
so
by
failing
to
pay
taxes
on
of
income
paid
to
bullock
the
adl
could
face
a
total
of
felony
counts
according
to
court
papers
the
adl
may
also
face
felony
charges
for
illegally
obtaining
confidential
information
from
police
computers
as
for
errors
the
adl
was
founded
in
chicago
and
moved
to
new
york
in
but
it
was
an
original
tenant
in
the
san
francisco
building
shown
in
the
voice
photo
moving
out
a
few
months
ago
i
never
wrote
that
an
adl
leader
was
deeply
involved
in
the
pollard
israeli
spy
operation
i
reported
that
pollard
himself
made
the
charge
and
in
court
papers
pollards
own
lawyer
said
that
the
wife
of
pollards
handler
worked
for
the
adl
if
i
have
a
bias
it
is
on
the
side
of
the
first
and
fourth
amendments
