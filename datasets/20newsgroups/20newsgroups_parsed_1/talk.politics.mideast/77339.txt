it
seems
that
to
keep
the
peace
talks
going
israel
has
to
keep
making
goodwill
gesture
after
goodwill
gesture
while
palestinian
arabs
continue
to
go
around
hunting
jews
you
know
that
putting
something
like
this
out
on
the
newsgroup
is
only
going
to
generate
flames
not
discussion
try
adding
some
substance
to
the
issue
of
gestures
you
mentioned
what
is
it
you
feel
that
israel
has
offered
as
a
gesture
what
would
you
realistically
expect
to
see
presented
by
the
arabspalestinians
in
the
way
of
gesture
timbo
israel
has
not
been
recognized
as
a
state
by
the
arabs
except
for
egypt
of
course
isnt
that
a
gesture
what
has
israel
offered
well
it
has
been
calling
for
peace
talks
for
years
asked
for
economic
relations
and
asked
for
diplomatic
ties
what
else
is
there
would
you
have
israel
sacrifice
its
security
nay
i
think
not
peace
