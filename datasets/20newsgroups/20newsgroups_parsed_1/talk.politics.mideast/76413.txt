i
would
like
to
share
with
netters
a
few
points
i
picked
up
from
the
pbs
frontline
program
regarding
irans
nuclear
activities
aired
on
tuesday
april
for
the
sake
of
brevity
ill
present
them
in
some
separate
points
already
say
it
the
other
week
on
cbc
snoozeworld
as
many
other
western
programs
this
program
was
laid
on
a
bed
of
misinformation
throughout
the
program
to
maximize
the
effect
of
the
program
on
the
viewer
some
of
the
misinformations
were
as
follows
yeah
i
thought
bonanza
was
full
of
lies
about
the
west
while
the
number
of
martyrs
during
the
sacred
defense
against
iraqi
aggression
has
been
officially
announced
to
be
about
and
even
most
radical
counterrevolutionary
groups
claim
that
iran
and
iraq
had
a
total
of
one
million
dead
this
program
claims
that
iran
alone
has
one
million
dead
left
from
the
war
the
translation
of
iranian
officials
talks
are
not
true
for
example
when
iranian
head
of
atomic
energy
says
that
it
hurts
me
to
see
that
iran
is
the
subject
of
these
unfriendly
propaganda
the
translator
says
it
hurts
to
see
that
iran
is
doing
unfriendly
research
almost
all
alleged
devices
or
material
bought
or
planned
to
be
bought
by
iranians
were
of
countless
dual
usage
while
the
program
tries
to
undermine
their
nonmilitary
uses
without
any
reference
to
irans
big
population
and
its
inevitable
need
to
other
sources
of
energy
in
near
future
and
its
current
deficit
in
electrical
power
why
the
hell
would
such
an
oil
rich
and
hydroelectric
potential
to
be
exploited
spend
billions
on
a
nuclear
energy
programme
the
whole
program
is
trying
to
show
the
sharif
university
of
technology
as
a
nuclear
research
center
while
even
the
cameramen
of
the
program
know
well
that
in
a
country
like
iran
without
a
so
tightly
closed
society
no
one
can
make
a
nuclear
bomb
in
a
university
taking
in
account
the
scientific
advancement
of
sharif
u
in
engineering
fields
and
its
potential
role
in
improvement
of
irans
industries
and
eventually
the
lives
of
people
it
is
obvious
that
they
are
persuading
other
countries
to
prevent
them
from
further
helping
this
university
or
other
ones
in
scientific
and
industrial
efforts
a
key
point
in
programs
justifications
is
trying
to
disvalidate
as
much
as
possible
all
efforts
done
by
iaea
in
their
numerous
visits
from
irans
different
sites
they
say
we
are
not
sure
if
the
places
visited
by
iaea
are
the
real
ones
or
not
or
we
can
not
rely
on
iaeas
reports
and
observation
because
they
failed
to
see
iraqs
nuclear
activities
before
as
if
they
didnt
know
that
iraq
was
trying
to
build
nuclear
weapons
yeah
and
we
have
every
reason
in
the
world
to
trust
the
iranian
regime
after
all
theyve
been
so
forward
with
us
in
the
past
as
an
extremely
personal
opinion
the
most
disgusting
aspect
of
the
program
was
the
arrogance
of
the
member
of
us
senate
foreign
affairs
william
triplet
in
his
way
of
talking
as
if
he
was
the
god
talking
from
the
absolute
knowledge
maybe
he
is
god
i
hope
all
iranians
be
aware
of
the
gradual
buildup
against
their
country
in
western
media
and
i
hope
iranian
authorities
continue
to
their
wise
and
calculated
approach
with
regard
to
international
affairs
and
peaceful
coexistence
with
friendly
nations
