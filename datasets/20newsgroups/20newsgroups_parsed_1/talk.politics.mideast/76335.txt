final
solution
for
the
gaza
ghetto
while
israeli
jews
fete
the
uprising
of
the
warsaw
ghetto
they
repress
by
violent
means
the
uprising
of
the
gaza
ghetto
and
attempt
to
starve
the
gazans
the
jews
in
the
warsaw
ghetto
were
fighting
to
keep
themselves
and
their
families
from
being
sent
to
nazi
gas
chambers
groups
like
hamas
and
the
islamic
jihad
fight
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
driving
all
jews
into
the
sea
perhaps
we
should
persuade
jewish
people
to
help
these
wnderful
freedom
fighters
attain
this
ultimate
goal
maybe
the
freedom
fighters
will
choose
to
spare
the
cooperative
jews
is
that
what
you
are
counting
on
elias
the
pity
of
murderers
you
say
your
mother
was
jewish
how
ashamed
she
must
be
of
her
son
i
am
sorry
mrs
davidsson
harry
ok
its
my
turn
driving
the
jews
into
the
sea
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
this
driving
the
jews
into
the
sea
sentance
attributed
to
islamic
movements
and
the
plo
it
simply
cant
be
proven
as
part
of
their
plan
pro
israeli
activists
repeat
it
like
parrots
without
checking
its
authenticity
since
it
was
coined
by
bnai
brith
what
hamas
and
islamic
jihad
believe
in
as
far
as
i
can
get
from
the
arab
media
is
an
islamic
state
that
protects
the
rights
of
all
its
inhabitants
under
koranic
law
this
would
be
a
reversal
of
the
situation
in
which
the
jews
in
palestine
took
control
of
the
land
and
its
mostly
muslim
inhabitants
however
whoever
committed
crimes
against
humanity
torture
blowing
up
their
homes
murders
must
be
treated
and
tried
as
a
war
criminal
the
political
thought
of
these
movements
shows
that
a
freedom
of
choice
will
be
given
to
the
jews
in
living
under
the
new
law
or
leaving
to
the
destintion
of
their
choice
as
for
the
plo
i
am
at
a
loss
to
explain
what
is
going
inside
arafats
mind
although
their
political
thinking
seems
far
fetched
with
israel
acting
as
a
true
superpower
in
the
region
the
islamic
movements
are
using
the
same
weapon
the
jews
used
to
establish
their
state
religion
ahmed
forget
the
syntax
ahmed
and
focus
on
the
semnatics
the
fact
is
that
the
plo
does
not
recognize
israels
right
to
exist
this
is
perfectly
obvious
from
the
plo
covenant
cairo
the
covenant
calls
for
the
destruction
of
the
zionist
entity
as
far
as
i
know
the
israeldestruction
clauses
still
exist
in
the
document
which
specifies
the
purpose
for
the
existence
of
the
plo
if
you
would
like
i
can
post
the
relevant
caluses
now
the
hamas
ideal
is
far
more
radical
it
seems
i
know
it
has
been
posted
here
several
times
and
while
i
do
not
have
a
copy
of
it
i
am
sure
that
someone
does
and
he
or
she
of
course
would
be
more
than
happy
to
repost
it
regardless
of
phrasing
groups
like
hamas
and
the
hezbollah
and
even
the
newly
moderate
and
politicallycorrect
plo
have
at
the
very
heart
of
their
ideologies
the
need
for
the
destrcution
of
israel
it
just
seems
to
me
that
mr
davidssons
suggestion
that
jews
support
people
envolved
in
these
organizations
is
not
a
particularly
appealing
one
to
many
jews
