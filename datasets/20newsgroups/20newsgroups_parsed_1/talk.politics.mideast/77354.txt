sent
to
the
ketziot
prison
camp
to
take
care
of
arab
prisoner
who
were
housed
in
sections
of
prisoners
each
with
each
section
subdivided
in
units
housing
prisoners
the
prisoners
would
communicate
with
other
distant
sections
sometimes
yards
away
by
taking
stones
tying
written
notes
to
the
stones
and
throwing
them
with
incredible
precision
to
other
sections

were
at

three
prisoners
who
could
