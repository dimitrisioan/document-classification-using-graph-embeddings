spinning
they
were
killing
my
family
and
here

pounded
my
fists
on
the
door
with
all
my
might
he
opened
up
the
man
of
the

for
a
long
time
and
then
opened
the
door
after
all
ira
came
in
with
lilia
we
threw
ourselves
into
each
others
arms
crying
then
the
man
locked
us
into
the
bathroom
we
sat
there
for
a
long
time
through
the
door
he
told
us
calm
the
children
and
calm
yourselves
down
too
calm
down
this
man
was
hiding
us
but
what
of
our
family
when
i
was
still
in
our
apartment
i
had
sensed
that
none
of
us
would
come
out
of
this
alive
i
said
igor
edik
lets
say
farewell
and
edik
turned
around
and
looked
at
me
as
if
to
say
is
that
some
kind
of
joke
all
the
same
i
thought
they
would
kill
all
of
us
igor
looked
at
me
too
but
it
was
already
too
late
they
started
pounding
on
the
door
igor
was
standing
next
to
the
door
before
that
he
had
told
us
go
lock
yourselves
in
that
room
and
sit
tight
he
thought
we
were
in
the
room
but
before
we
went
out
onto
the
balcony
we
went
to
them
edik
igor
lets
say
farewell
igor
didnt
think
we
could
climb
over
to
the
other
balcony
and
we
did
get
over
there
and
i
myself
cant
believe
we
were
able
to
save
ourselves
igor
put
on
a
helmet
and
edik
had
his
coat
on
and
he
put
on
a
fur
hat
all
the
menigor
edik
their
father
and
misha
ambartsumianthey
all
stood
next
to
the
door
they
thought
they
would
pound
on
it
a
while
and
leave
but
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
they
ordered
in
azerbaijani
open
the
door
we
were
all
silent
waiting
someone
outside
the
door
said
theyre
home
theyre
in
there
break
down
the
door
and
i
remember
my
fatherinlaw
whispering
theyre
going
to
break
it
down
now
its
coming
down
now
he
had
something
in
his
hands
i
think
it
was
a
knife
if
they
got
in
we
were
going
to
defend
ourselves
in
the
hall
near
the
door
there
were
two
metal
chair
legs
from
outside
the
door
they
said
were
counting
to
five
open
up
but
we
were
all
quiet
we
didnt
answer
them
we
made
like
no
one
was
home
we
figured
theyd
leave
theyd
get
tired
and
leave
my
fatherinlaw
had
said
its
not
possible
theyd
come
into
my
home
how
can
that
be
everyone
knows
us
all
of
sumgait
knows
our
family
we
are
on
good
terms
with
everyone
and
indeed
a
day
did
not
pass
that
there
wasnt
an
azerbaijani
guest
at
our
table
we
had
a
nice
dacha
everyone
would
get
together
there
often
azerbaijanis
liked
being
with
us
there
too
but
now
we
had
to
save
ourselves
we
had
to
flee
from
our
own
home
ira
i
remember
said
im
not
leaving
here
my
brothers
and
my
parents
are
here
im
going
to
fight
alongside
them
thats
just
what
she
said
she
picked
up
a
knife
and
said
if
they
open
the
door
and
come
into
the
apartment
then
im
going
to
fight
alongside
my
family
im
not
going
anywhere
we
were
at
sevils
when
they
broke
into
our
apartment
we
heard
fighting
and
shouting
the
noise
was
terrible
and
when
we
hid
upstairs
on
the
fifth
floor
at
the
lezgins
apartment
you
could
hear
everything
up
there
too
even
iras
voice
i
remember
her
calling
her
mother
several
times
she
called
her
for
a
long
time
i
started
pounding
on
the
door
in
the
bathroom
open
the
door
what
are
they
doing
to
ira
whos
shouting
thats
ira
shouting
thats
her
voice
but
the
lezgin
said
its
nothing
calm
down
no
its
not
in
your
apartment
he
was
lying
to
me
so
id
calm
down
two
hours
went
by
and
the
lezgin
opened
the
door
and
said
karina
igor
got
away
calm
down
he
ran
away
he
saw
igor
break
away
and
run
off
with
his
own
eyes
they
killed
him
outside
next
to
the
building
while
we
were
in
the
bathroom
i
experienced
every
possible
human
terror
the
way
ira
shouted
she
shouted
save
me
mamma
save
me
mamma
mamma
she
repeated
it
several
times
there
was
a
wild
din
there
were
very
many
people
there
all
of
them
shouting
all
of
them
bellowing
howling
whistlingyou
just
cant
imagine
what
was
going
on
what
the
roar
was
like
apparently
after
they
had
killed
ira
those
murderers
came
into
the
entryway
where
we
were
hiding
and
came
upstairs
all
the
way
up
to
the
fifth
floor
i
dont
know
if
they
were
just
looking
for
any
armenians
or
for
us
in
particular
but
i
think
they
were
looking
for
us
because
when
we
had
climbed
over
the
balconies
someone
on
the
street
was
saying
that
the
daughtersinlaw
were
climbing
over
the
balconies
and
after
we
heard
ira
we
heard
them
coming
up
the
stairs
in
the
entryway
and
hammering
on
the
doors
i
thought
those
were
our
last
moments
and
started
saying
goodbye
to
my
children
kissing
them
they
were
sleeping
i
woke
them
up
kristina
seryozha
wake
up
and
i
tell
ira
ira
if
something
happens
well
throw
ourselves
off
the
balcony
we
were
on
the
fifth
floor
apparently
our
lezgin
neighbor
had
opened
the
door
too
because
later
he
said
i
opened
the
door
and
told
them
there
were
no
armenians
inside
and
after
they
all
left
our
neighbor
went
out
on
the
balcony
himself
to
see
they
were
gone
we
werent
friends
with
those
lezgin
neighbors
we
only
knew
each
other
from
the
building
but
the
people
we
were
friends
with
wouldnt
even
consider
hiding
us
the
lezgin
let
us
out
of
the
bathroom
they
had
a
candle
burning
he
said
karina
therere
no
lights
on
in
our
block
the
whole
block
was
dark
the
whole
block
its
a
huge
block
too
the
lezgin
said
im
afraid
to
keep
you
until
morning
im
afraid
of
the
neighbors
they
might
kill
me
for
saving
you
i
said
what
are
you
saying
well
leave
now
but
we
cant
just
leave
with
the
children
in
the
middle
of
the
night
give
us
time
to
find
somewhere
else
to
hide
he
said
well
ok
go
look
i
asked
ira
ira
do
you
want

and
accompanied
me
home
i
never
went
out
alone
and
now
here
i
was
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
after
a
slaughter
like
that
too
it
was
probably
after
eleven
later
i
called
the
boarding
school
and
my
director
answered
he
said
karina

i
didnt
know
i
was
calling
from
a
public
phone
outside
and
didnt
know
where
i
was
i
got
confused
and
hung
up
the
receiver
from
him
i
only
found
out
what
time
it
was
i
asked
him
what
time
is
it
he
said
i
think
but
i
dont
really
remember
so
anyway
zhasmen
and
i
went
out
into
the
courtyard
i
look
and
see
what
appears
to
be
a
person
not
far
from
our
apartment
and
there
was
the
smell
of
something
burnt
i
became
horrified
i
looked
at
the
corpse
for
a
long
time
it
was
either

of
them
zhasmen
grabbed
my
hand
and
squeezed
it

i
turned
around
and
saw
a
large
truck
it

have
belonged
to
the
bandits
because
they
came
to
kill
us

we
lived
in
the
third
entryway
and
that
truck

count
on
them
before

reached
the
police

the
police
station
and
tell
them
everything
i
said

to
go
there
im
afraid
of
them
he
said

afraid
we
went
to
the
police
and
they
wrote

and
the
military
vehicle
went
to
our

didnt
go
with
them
they
left
me
at
the
police
