btw
with
bosnias
large
moslem
population
why
have
nations
like
turkey
saudi
arabia
syria
egypt
and
others
with
either
money
or
strong
military
forces
not
spoken
out
more
forcibly
or
offered
to
help
out
bosnia
obviously
you
really
dont
know
they
have
spoken
out
cf
secy
of
state
christophers
recent
trip
to
the
me
note
the
clause
more
forcibly
above
my
point
is
that
they
have
made
a
few
proforma
perfunctory
remarks
and
sent
in
a
few
cs
and
so
forth
but
its
clearly
not
something
theyre
losing
much
sleep
over
theyre
just
going
through
the
motions
while
moslems
are
being
ethnically
cleansed
out
of
what
used
to
be
yugoslavia
the
us
has
been
speaking
out
far
more
loudly
than
the
moslem
nations
in
the
un
and
other
world
forums
besides
theres
no
case
that
can
be
made
for
us
military
involvement
there
that
doesnt
apply
equally
well
to
say
liberia
angola
or
it
appears
with
the
khmer
rouges
new
campaign
cambodia
nonwhites
dont
count
hmmsome
might
say
kuwaitis
are
nonwhite
ooops
i
forgot
kuwaitis
are
oil
rich
loaded
with
petrodollars
etc
so
they
dont
count
precisely
humanitarian
concerns
were
not
the
primary
justification
for
us
involvement
in
the
gulf
oil
and
geopolitics
were
if
the
the
kuwaitis
didnt
have
oil
and
assuming
iraq
still
saw
fit
to
invade
them
i
doubt
you
would
have
seen
operation
