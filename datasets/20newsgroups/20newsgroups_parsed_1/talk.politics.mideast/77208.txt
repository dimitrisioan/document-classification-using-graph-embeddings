ive
read
most
of
the
history
books
dealing
with
this
period
good
and
bad
and
while
it
is
possible
that
i
missed
one
or
two
none
of
those
ive
read
documents
any
razing
of
mosques
so
i
think
that
this
remarkable
claim
requires
specific
documentation
for
the
forgetful
newcomers
here
are
the
references
the
reference
i
based
my
posting
on
originally
is
the
book
the
west
bank
story
by
rafik
halabi
new
york
harcourt
brace
jovanovich
original
title
die
westbank
story
quoting
from
the
west
bank
story
pages
on
the
night
of
june
an
israeli
officer
marched
from
door
to
door
through
the
moghrabi
quarter
of
east
jerusalem
giving
the
residents
three
hours
notice
to
evacuate
their
homes
the
participants
in
a
july
meeting
of
a
group
of
arab
relgious
and
political
figures
protested
the
immodest
dress
of
israelis
visiting
the
mosques
and
the
destruction
of
two
mosques
in
the
moghrabi
quarter
adjacent
to
the
western
wall
this
issue
has
been
going
on
for
a
while
and
your
presentation
here
of
just
one
reference
probably
wont
resolve
this
issue
to
those
that
oppose
your
insistence
that
mosques
were
destroyed
even
in
your
location
of
this
one
reference
you
spend
most
of
your
quote
dealing
with
an
incidence
that
while
abhorrant
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
at
hand
here
then
at
the
end
of
the
quote
there
is
an
almost
offhand
comment
that
two
mosques
were
destroyed
tim
youre
missing
the
big
sleightofhand
here
i
can
accept
every
word
quoted
from
halabi
and
still
have
zero
evidence
of
any
mosques
being
razed
note
that
what
halabi
refers
to
is
not
that
mosques
were
razed
but
that
people
protested
alleged
razing
too
well
we
know
that
this
is
a
common
demagogic
tactic
or
has
anyone
forgotten
the
temple
mount
riots
when
the
moslem
crowd
was
led
to
believe
that
the
israeli
guards
were
there
to
cover
for
the
tmf

of
