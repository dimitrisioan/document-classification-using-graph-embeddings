ankara
turkey
ap
april
we
find
in
the
last
paragraph
turanist
although
premier
suleyman
demirel
criticized
ozals
often
turanist
brash
calls
for
more
turkish
influence
he
also
has
spoken
turanist
of
a
swath
of
turkic
peoples
stretching
from
the
adriatic
turanist
sea
to
the
great
wall
of
china
who
does
demirel
think
he
is
fooling
it
seems
at
both
ends
of
his
envisioned
panturkic
empire
the
balkans
and
the
caucasus
turkeys
fascist
boasts
are
being
preempted
i
would
suggest
turkey
let
the
world
feel
some
of
their
grey
wolf
teeth
and
attempt
to
stretch
from
the
adriatic
to
china
turkey
will
have
cried
wolf
just
once
too
much
mentioning
that
turkic
people
are
widespread
means
desiring
a
turkish
empire
is
that
the
logical
thing
to
conclude
from
a
statement
like
that
to
me
it
just
says
that
turkey
may
have
economical
benefits
from
that
if
she
can
be
competitive
enough
no
more
than
that
but
of
course
you
have
the
freedom
of
extrapolating
as
you
wish
from
any
statement
one
question
in
what
context
did
ozal
use
the
words
you
are
quoting
can
you
give

whole
