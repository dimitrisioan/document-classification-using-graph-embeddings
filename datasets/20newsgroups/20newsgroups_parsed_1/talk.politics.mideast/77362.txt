this

as
the
turks
had
solved
the
armenian
problem
in
turkey
by
slaying

as
you
point
out
above
the
original
quote
used
the
term
tartars
as
distinct
from
turks
but
you
perhaps
feel
free
to
make
these
minor
adjustments
in
the
name
of
truth
i
went
through
this
just
a
few
weeks
ago
here
it
comes
again
the
entire
turkish
population
of
armenia
which
armenians
called
tartars
constituted
at
least
about
of
the
total
population
of
armenia
was
deliberately
exterminated
for
the
population
statistics
please
look
to
the
book
of
richard
hovannessian
armenia
on
the
road
to
independence
i
listed
three
books
earlier
of
such
a
monstrous
crime
by
the
writings
of
one
armenian
one
american
and
one
british

also
i
personally
have
copies
of
documents
of
this
crime
by
the
writings
of
two
armenians
and
also
one
american
the
official
british
report
about
this
massacre
mentioned
in

of
these
documents
lord

interview
is
the
report
of
the
british
high
commissioner
to

sir

wardrop
an
appropriate
analogy
with
the
jewish
holocaust
might
be
the
systematic
extermination
of
the
entire
muslim
population
of
the
independent
republic
of
armenia
which
consisted
of
at
least
percent
of
the
population
of
that
republic
the
