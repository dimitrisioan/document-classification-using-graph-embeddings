let
me
clearify
mr
turkish
armenia
is
not
getting
itchy
she
is
simply
letting
the
world
know
that
she
will
no
longer
sit
there
quiet
and
let
turks
get
away
with
their
famous
tricks
armenians
do
remember
of
the
turkish
invasion
of
the
greek
island
of
cypress
while
the
world
simply
watched
it
is
more
appropriate
to
address
netters
with
their
names
as
they
appear
in
their
signatures
i
failed
to
do
so
since
you
did
not
bother
to
sign
your
posting
not
only
because
it
is
the
polite
thing
to
do
but
also
to
avoid
addressing
ladies
with
mr
as
you
have
done
secondly
the
island
of
which
the
name
is
more
correctly
spelled
as
cyprus
has
never
been
greek
but
rather
it
has
been
home
to
a
bicommunal
society
formed
of
greeks
and
turks
it
seems
that
you
know
as
little
about
the
history
and
the
demography
of
the
island
as
you
know
about
the
essence
of
turkeys
military
intervention
to
it
under
international
agreements
be
that
as
it
may
an
analogy
between
an
act
of
occupation
in
history
and
what
is
going
on
today
on
azerbaijani
land
can
only
be
drawn
with
the
expansionist
policy
that
armenia
is
now
pursuing
but
i
could
agree
that
it
is
not
for
us
to
issue
diagnoses
to
the
political
conduct
of
countries
and
promulgate
them
in
such
terminology
as
