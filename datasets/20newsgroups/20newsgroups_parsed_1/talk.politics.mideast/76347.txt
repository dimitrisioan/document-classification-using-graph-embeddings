writes
first
of
all
i
never
said
the
holocaust
i
said
before
the
holocaust
im
not
ignorant
of
the
holocaust
and
know
more
about
nazi
germany
than
most
people
maybe
including
you
uh
oh
the
first
sign
of
an
argument
without
meritthe
stating
of
ones
qualifications
in
an
area
if
you
know
something
about
nazi
germany
show
it
if
you
dont
shut
up
simple
as
that
i
dont
think
the
suffering
of
some
jews
during
wwii
justifies
the
crimes
commited
by
the
israeli
government
any
attempt
to
call
civil
liberterians
like
myself
antisemetic
is
not
appreciated
all
jews
suffered
during
wwii
not
just
our
beloved
who
perished
or
were
tortured
we
all
suffered
second
the
namecalling
was
directed
against
you
not
civillibertarians
in
general
your
namedropping
of
a
fancy
sounding
political
term
is
yet
another
attempt
to
cite
qualifications
in
order
to
obfuscate
your
glaring
unpreparedness
for
this
argument
go
back
to
the
minors
junior
all
humans
suffered
emotionally
some
jews
and
many
others
suffered
physically
it
is
sad
that
people
like
you
are
so
blinded
by
emotions
that
they
cant
see
the
facts
thanks
for
calling
me
names
it
only
assures
me
of
what
kind
of
ignorant
people
i
am
dealing
with
i
included
your
letter
since
i
thought
it
demonstrated
my
point
more
than
anything
i
could
write
when
youre
willing
to
actually
support
something
you
say
with
fact
or
argument
rather
than
covering
up
your
own
inadequacies
with
feigned
offense
let
me
know
otherwise
back
to
your
own
league
son
i
have
never
seen
such
immaturity
among
semitophiles
this
andi
beyer
character
shows
no
signs
of
anti
semitism
yet
because
he
deviates
from
the
norm
of
accepted
opinion
you
attack
him
why
did
not
anyone
venture
to
answer
andis
question
in
an
intelligent
and
unoffending
manner
the
only
ones
guilty
here
of
not
backing
up
there
viewpoints
with
fact
are
the
israelophiles
now
will
we
please
start
having
some
intelligent
conversation
you
all
are
an
insult
to
you
race
assuming
you
are
also
semitic
now
i
have
a
comment
concerning
israeli
terrorism
during
the
s
and
s
the
hirgun
and
other
branch
off
militant
groups
did
fight
the
british
do
get
them
out
of
palestine
yet
i
fail
to
see
how
this
israeli
form
of
terrorism
was
better
than
the
terrorism
practiced
now
by
the
arabs
these
jewish
terrorist
groups
killed
innocent
british
soldiers
but
not
only
thta
also
killed
many
jews
who
were
in
favor
of
a
compromise
with
the
palestinians
in
addition
they
massacred
an
entire
palestinian
village
in
contributing
to
the
exodus
of
the
frightened
palestinians
who
feared
their
very
lives
i
mention
this
not
because
im
anti
semitic
im
part
jewish
but
because
this
self
righteousness
on
the
part
of
the
israelites
pisses
me
off
so
im
not
as
critical
of
the
palestinians
because
they
were
indeed
screwed
over
by
the
jews
it
s
a
damn
shame
that
the
palestinians
had
to
pay
for
german
and
european
anti
semitism
pissed
off
at
immature
closeminded
self
righteous
semites
