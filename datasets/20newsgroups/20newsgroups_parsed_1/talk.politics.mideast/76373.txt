freedom
in
usa
writes
freedom
of
speech
does
not
mean
that
others
are
compelled
to
give
one
the
means
to
speak
publicly
some
systems
have
regulations
prohibiting
the
dissemination
of
racist
and
bigoted
messages
from
accounts
they
issue
apparently
thats
not
the
case
with
virginiaedu
since
you
are
still
posting
alan
h
stein
first
of
all
im
still
baffled
what
you
possibly
could
have
found
racist
in
my
argument
for
freedom
of
speach
i
did
not
mention
names
nationalities
countries
let
alone
races
you
are
right
in
that
virginiaedu
does
not
have
a
thought
police
like
israelnysernetorg
seems
to
i
didnt
know
that
you
guys
are
getting
a
privelege
by
the
israelis
by
getting
the
means
to
speak
publicly
virginiaedu
lets
every
student
regardless
of
their
opinion
to
speak
their
mind
virginiaedu
is
true
to
its
founding
father
thomas
jefferson
the
author
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
allowing
freedom
of
speach
sorry
you
guys
in
israel
have
a
hard
time
with
the
concept
