writes
maybe
the
following
example
helps
it
is
understandable
that
the
views
of
agic
are
his
alone
nevertheless
any
independent
or
alone
sorry
but
the
following
western
scholars
are
forced
to
disagree
with
you
during
the
first
world
war
and
the
ensuing
years
the
armenians
through
a
premeditated
and
systematic
genocide
tried
to
complete
its
centuriesold
policy
of
annihilation
against
the
turks
and
kurds
by
savagely
murdering
million
muslims
and
deporting
the
rest
from
their
year
homeland
the
attempt
at
genocide
is
justly
regarded
as
the
first
instance
of
genocide
in
the
th
century
acted
upon
an
entire
people
this
event
is
incontrovertibly
