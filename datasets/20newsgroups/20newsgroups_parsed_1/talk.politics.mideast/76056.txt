instabul
was
called
konstantinoupolis
from
ad
until
about
the
s
thats
about
years
there
many
people
alive
today
who
were
born
in
a
city
called
konstantinoupolis
i
know
it
doesnt
make
sense
but
since
when
is
napoleon
about
sense
anyway
further
striking
bigoted
and
racist
attitude
of
certain
greeks
still
exists
in
our
day
most
greeks
insist
even
today
that
the
yearold
capital
of
the
ottoman
empire
should
be
called
not
by
its
rightful
name
of
istanbul
but
by
its
half
a
millenniumold
moniker
conswhatever
everyone
knows
that
new
york
city
was
once
called
new
amsterdam
but
dutch
people
do
not
persist
on
calling
it
that
today
the
name
of
stalingrad
too
is
long
gone
replaced
by
volgagrad
chinas
peking

its

these
changes
have
all
been
accepted
officially
by
everyone
in
the
world
but
greeks
are
still
determined
on
calling
the
turkish
istanbul
by
the
name
of
cons
how
can
one
explain
this
total
intransigence
what
makes
greeks
so
different
from
other
mortals
yearold
questionable
democracy
why
dont
they
seem
to
reconcile
with
the
fact
for
instance
that
istanbul
changed
hands
years
ago
in
ad
and
that
this
predates
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
by
years
the
declaration
of
us
independence
in
will
come
years
later
shouldnt
then
half
a
millennium
be
considered
enough
time
for
cons
to
be
called
a
turkish
city
where
is
the
logic
in
the
greek
reasoning
if
there
is
any
how
long
can
one
sit
on
the
laurels
of
an
ancient
civilization
ancient
greece
does
not
exist
any
more
than
any
other
civilizations
that
existed
on
the
soil
of
anatolia
these
undereducated
wieneramus
live
with
an
illusion
it
is
the
same
mentality
which
allows
them
to
rationalize
that
cyprus
is
a
greek
island
no
history
book
shows
that
it
ever
was
it
belonged
to
the
ottoman
turks
lock
stock
and
barrel
for
a
period
of
well
over
years
in
fact
prior
to
the
turks
acquisition
of
it
following
bloody
naval
battles
with
the
venetians
in
ad
the
island
of
cyprus
belonged
invariably
to
several
nations
the
assyrians
the
sumerians
the
phoenicians
the
egyptians
the
ottoman
turks
of
course
in
that
order
owned
it
as
their
territory
but
it
has
never
been
the
possession
of
the
government
of
greece
not
even
for
one
day
in
the
history
of
the
world
moreover
cyprus
is
located
miles
from
the
greek
mainland
but
only
miles
from
turkiyes
southern
coastline
saddam
hussein
claims
that
kuwait
was
once
iraqi
territory
and
the
greek
cypriot
government
and
the
terrorist
greek
governments
think
that
cyprus
also
was
once
part
of
the
greek
hegemony
those
arromdians
involved
in
this
grandiose
hallucination
should
wake
up
from
their
sweet
daydreams
and
confront
reality
again
wishful
thinking
is
unproductive
only
facts
count
as
for
selanik
those
jews
who
survived
these
assaults
in
southeastern
europe
fled
particularly
to
salonica
whose
jewish
population
increased
substantially
as
a
result
from
in
to
in
more
than
half
the
total
population
though
even
there
increased
persecution
by
local
greeks
led
many
jews
to
flee
elsewhere
in
the
ottoman
empire
particularly
to
the
great
port
of
izmir
despite
all
the
pressure
from
ottomans
and
foreign
jews
alike
the
ritual
murders
and
other
assaults
by
christians
on
jews
went
on
and
on
greek
efforts
to
decimate
the
jewish
population
of
salonica
culminated
in
and
following
greek
conquest
of
salonica
during
the
first
balkan
war
when
many
of
its
jews
were
either
killed
or
terrorized
into
leaving
though
greece
was
obligated
by
the
post
world
war
i
treaties
to
allow
jews
and
other
minorities
to
use
their
own
languages
in
education
and
to
practice
their
religions
without
hindrance
a
law
was
issued
in
which
forbad
all
inhabitants
from
working
on
sunday
stimulating
a
new
jewish
exodus
as
it
was
intended
to
do
between
and
there
was
a
series
of
antisemitic
riots
in
salonica
with
the
cambel
quarter
where
most
of
the
remaining
jews
lived
being
burned
to
the
ground
this
was
followed
by
regulations
requiring
the
use
of
greek
and
prohibiting
hebrew
and
judeaspanish
in
the
jewish
schools
a
start
was
made
also
on
expropriating
the
land
of
the
principal
jewish
cemetery
in
salonica
for
use
by
the
new
university
in
order
to
derive
the
jews
out
by
killing
and
driving
out
large
numbers
of
jews
the
greeks
left
a
substantial
greek
majority
in
the
city
for
the
first
time
and
starting
salonica
jewry
on
the
way
to
its
final
decimation
by
the
nazis
during
the
occupation
of
greece
starting
in
salonica
and
izmir
of
course
were
not
the
only
places
of
refuge
for
jewish
refugees
entering
the
empire
during
its
last
century
of
existence
istanbul
edirne
and
other
parts
of
rumelia
and
anatolia
received
thousands
more
nor
were
jews
the
only
refugees
received
and
helped
by
the
government
of
the
sultan
thousands
of
muslims
accompanied
them
in
flight
from
similar
persecutions
wherever
balkan
christian
states
gained
independence
or
expanded
the
russian
conquest
of
the
crimea
and
the
caucasus
starting
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
and
particularly
during
and
after
the
crimean
war
combined
with
the
same
independence
movements
in
southeastern
europe
that
had
caused
so
much
suffering
and
flight
among
its
jews
caused
thousands
of
helpless
ill
and
povertystricken
muslim
refugees
to
accompany
them
into
the
ever
shrinking
boundaries
of
the
ottoman
empire
with
the
istanbul
government
struggling
mightly
but
vainly
to
house
and
feed
them
as
best
it
could
from
to
as
many
as
crimean
tatars
circassians
and
other
muslims
from
north
and
east
of
the
black
sea
had
entered
anatolia
alone
as
many
as
more
came
during
the
next
twenty
years
while
refugees
entered
in
as
a
result
of
the
ottoman
wars
with
russia
and
the
balkan
states
with
an
equal
number
gaining
refuge
in
the
european
portions
of
the
