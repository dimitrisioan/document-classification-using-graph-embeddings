in
nazi
germany
armenians
were
considered
to
be
an
aryan
race
and
in
article
tim
clock
writes
there
was
no
such
letter
in
the
chronicle
on
that
date
or
at
any
other
time
is
this
a
figment
of
your
imagination
here
is
another
one
source
mitteilungsblatt
berlin
december
nr
and
yet
another
historical
fact
a
fact
that
for
years
has
been
deliberately
forgotten
concealed
and
wiped
from
memory
the
fact
of
armeniannazi
collaboration
a
magazine
called
mitteilungsblatt
der
deutscharmenischen
gesselschaft
is
the
clearest
and
most
definite
proof
of
this
collaboration
the
magazine
was
first
published
in
berlin
in
during
nazi
rule
of
germany
and
continued
publication
until
the
end
of
even
the
name
of
the
magazine
which
implies
a
declaration
of
armeniannazi
cooperation
is
attentiongetting
this
magazine
every
issue
of
which
proves
the
collaboration
is
historically
important
as
documentary
evidence
it
is
a
heap
of
writing
that
should
be
an
admonition
to
world
opinion
and
to
all
mankind
in
nazi
germany
armenians
were
considered
to
be
an
aryan
race
and
certain
political
economic
and
social
rights
were
thus
granted
to
them
they
occupied
positions
in
public
service
and
were
partners
in
nazi
practices
the
whole
world
of
course
knows
what
awaited
those
who
were
not
considered
aryan
and
what
befell
them

we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain

that
might
serve
as
ways
of

for
