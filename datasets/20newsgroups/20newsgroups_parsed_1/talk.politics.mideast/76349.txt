please
give
me
details
about
an
event
where
a
neutral
observer
was
killed
by
purpose
by
an
israeli
soldier
there
are
many
cases
but
i
do
not
remeber
names
the
isralis
shot
and
killed
a
un
observer
in
gaza
in
the
first
half
of
intifada
i
believe
that
most
of
the
world
has
seen
pictures
of
israeli
soldiers
who
were
breaking
the
cameras
of
the
reporters
kicking
reporters
out
confiscating
cassettes
and
showing
reporters
militery
orders
preventing
them
from
going
to
hot
areas
to
pick
pictures
and
make
reports
