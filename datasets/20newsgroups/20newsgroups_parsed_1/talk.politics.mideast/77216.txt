re
israeli
destruction
of
mosques
in
jerusalem
in
article

allegations
of
jewish
disrespect
for
the
objects
and
buildings
of
other
religions
are
one
of
antisemitic
stereotypes
that
permeate
western
culture
and
rumors
of
church
and
host
desacration
probably
caused
more
pogroms
than
blood
libel
about
years
ago
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
about
a
church
in
the
old
city
of
jerusalem
being
taken
over
by
a
jewish
group
in
fact
the
building
in
question
was
a
dormitory
that
belonged
to
a
church
and
was
not
physically
connected
to
any
church
it
had
been
leased
to
a
palestinean
arab
for
years
and
a
jewish
group
subleased
it
from
him
the
church
that
owned
the
building
disapproved
and
legal
action
was
started
to
revoke
the
sublease
the
media
however
made
it
look
like
jewish
vigilantes
were
stealing
church
property
in
jerusalem
by
force
the
stereotypes
that
pervade
our
culture
create
cognitive
illusions
that
reify
those
stereotypes
therefore
any
claim
that
appears
to
reify
a
stereotype
should
be
treated
by
decent
people
with
utmost
suspicion
until
and
unless
documented
the
damage
has
already
been
done
by
the
press
in
the
above
case
it
is
not
surprising
by
now
of
course
that
many
decent
people
regard
the
press
with
utmost
suspicion
if
such
a
claim
is
crossposted
to
a
news
group
in
which
it
has
not
been
documented
before
such
as
scj
a
reference
should
be
given
the
first
time
it
appears
now
that
the
claim
has
been
documented
i
regard
the
whole
episode
as
disgusting
and
shameful
especially
so
because
the
official
who
failed
to
provide
proper
temporary
facilities
for
the
evicted
jordanians
was
probably
jewish
and
as
a
jew
i
know
that
he
should
have
known
better
you
appear
to
be
referring
to
moshe
dayan
how
do
you
know
that
the
evicted
jordanians
were
not
provided
with
something
else
in
fact
this
thread
indicates
that
they
were
squatters
on
land
that
they
did
not
own
but
received
compensation
for
their
loss
anyways
woe
to
jews
when
they
feel
that
recovering
land
that
has
been
taken
from
them
by
force
with
ethnic
cleansing
of
any
remaining
jews
is
disgusting
and
shameful
