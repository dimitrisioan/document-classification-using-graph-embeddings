i
am
not
saying
that
conflicts
started
with
that
it
is
only
not
one
side
being
the
aggressive
and
the
ither
always
suffering
it
is
sad
that
we
both
still
are
not
trying
to
compromise
i
remember
the
action
of
the
turkish
government
by
removing
the
visa
requirement
for
greeks
to
come
to
turkey
i
thought
it
was
a
positive
attempt
to
make
the
relations
better
i
thought
it
was
a
smart
move
to
receive
more
money
from
greek
tourists
i
bet
that
this
week
there
should
be
about
tourists
from
greece
in
turkey
each
one
will
leave
at
least
so
go
and
figure
what
this
means
to
your
economy
if
you
had
kept
the
visa
requirement
how
many
greeks
would
bother
to
visit
turkey
smart
indeed
if
what
youre
saying
is
true
greeks
who
visit
are
happy
the
turkish
merchants
are
happy
who
is
harmed
no
one
so
not
only
was
it
a
smart
move
it
was
also
a
good
move
for
it
adds
to
the
happiness
of
greeks
per
week
and
however
many
turkish
merchants
they
interact
with
one
simple
move
in
the
paperwork
arena
lotsa
happy
people
of
both
nationalities
just
and
observation
