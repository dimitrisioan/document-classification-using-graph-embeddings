it
is
easy
for
sen
biden
to
say
that
when
there
are
no
us
troops
in
zepa
or
srebinica
or
sarejevo
the
existing
un
policy
may
certaining
be
wrong
but
the
us
wants
to
dictate
policy
and
make
europe
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
that
policy
bosnia
is
a
big
enough
problem
for
the
us
to
preach
about
what
other
countries
should
be
doing
with
their
forcesbut
its
forces
are
safely
tucked
away
at
home
in
the
us
look
nobody
asked
those
countries
about
their
un
forces
to
be
on
the
ground
they
can
take
their
forces
which
are
well
bosnia
and
the
us
didthe
un
can
not
impose
blue
berets
on
a
country
and
the
us
has
voted
for
the
current
policy
and
mandate
in
the
security
counciland
could
have
said
no
if
it
wanted
to
it
has
a
veto
clinton
has
not
demanded
the
removal
of
the
un
forcesbecause
he
want
to
have
his
cake
and
eat
it
toohe
wants
to
dictate
policy
but
not
be
responsible
for
the
policy
he
wants
to
dictate
if
clinton
asks
for
the
blue
berets
to
leave
then
he
bill
clinton
becomes
responsible
for
what
happenshim
and
sen
biden
and
their
friends
who
want
to
fight
the
war
from
ftas
long
as
the
blue
berets
are
there
clinton
can
use
europe
as
a
scapegoat
for
american
indecisiveness
i
fully
admit
that
the
current
un
policy
approved
by
all
the
major
powers
including
the
us
may
be
wrong
or
inappropriatebut
these
backseat
drivers
in
the
us
like
clinton
and
biden
are
just
a
bunch
of
hypocrites
looking
for
an
gimmick
to
look
like
they
are
doing
something
to
assuage
their
own
consciences
and
those
who
are
demanding
action
or
leadershipand
most
european
leaders
are
smart
enough
to
know
the
difference
between
american
hot
air
and
american
leadership
i
think
senator
biden
said
it
all
what
has
to
be
said
on
this
issue
europe
is
a
sad
place
to
criticize
human
rights
in
anywhere
in
this
world
like
biden
said
they
are
the
bigots
when
it
comes
to
cultural
difference
and
minorty
closer
to
their
home
well
if
biden
is
so
outragedwhy
the
hell
doesnt
he
do
something
about
itwhere
is
his
resolution
in
the
us
senate
for
a
declaration
of
war
or
the
commitment
of
us
forces
and
troops
biden
is
just
full
of
hot
air
