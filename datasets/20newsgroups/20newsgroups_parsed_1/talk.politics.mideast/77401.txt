are
quotes
of
his
speech
kuwait
itself
was
an
entity
identified
as
kuwait
even
before
iraq
was
identified
as
iraq
in
the
ottoman
empire
kuwait
was
in
existence
since
we
continued
to
be
in
existence
until
the
conflict
between
the
ottoman
empire
and
the
british
and
others
in
the
area
thereafter
we
signed
with
the
british
in
a
protective
agreement
whereby
the
british
guaranteed
the
sovereignty
and
security
of
kuwait
in
the
british
and
the
ottoman
signed
an
agreement
defining
without
any
doubt
the
borders
of
kuwait
as
they
stand
today
such
an
agreement
was
reconfirmed
in
between
the
kuwaiti
government
and
the
iraqi
government
at
that
time
that
is
when
iraq
became
a
state
after
kuwait
itself
in
when
we
declared
our
independence
iraq
seized
the
opportunity
to
claim
kuwait
as
part
of
iraq
there
were
threats
the
british
came
in
and
arab
forces
came
in
to
guarantee
the
sovereignty
and
territorial
integrity
of
kuwait
in
kuwait
and
iraq
again
signed
border
agreement

defining
our
territory
and
iraqs
recognition

the
sovereignty
and
territory

origins

used
kuwait
as
a

residence
the
beginning
of
kuwait

back
to
the
late
th
century

some
historians
go
further

in

well
documented
study
about
the
history
of

between
there
was
no
ottoman
rule
on

region
in

half

of

the

the
aim

external
policy
was
to
keep
on
friendly
relations
with
all
the
forces
working
in
the

p
abu
hakima
continued
in
his
conclusions
that
kuwait
was
not
a
dependency
of
basra
the
persian
occupation
of
basra
did
not
affect
kuwait
p
kuwait
had
its
own
identity
through
the
ottoman
domination
on
the
arab
world
this
identity
was
clear
to
the
british
and
the
french
who
tried
to
win
the
support
of
kuwaits
sheikh

when

wanted

this
is

a
series
of
articles
that
testify
to
the
independence
of
kuwait
throughout
its
history
from
both
iraq
and
the
ottomans
the
following
text
is
related
to
an
expedition
carried
out
by
the
ottomans
in
against
the
wahhabis
in
eastern
arabia
where
the
oil
fields
in

arabia
now
kuwait
and
its
ruler
at
that
time
sheikh
abdulla
ibn
sabah
ibn
jabir
allied
themselves
with
the
turks
abdullah
role
in
the
fighting
was
not
a
minor
one
he
joined
the
expedition
as
a
commander
of
the
large
kuwaiti
fleet
and
was
the
first
to
use
its
guns
against
the
besieged
town
of
alqatif
had
it
not
been
for
this
bombardment
by
the
kuwaiti
fleet
alqatif
obviously
would
not
have
surrendered
in
a
mere
three
hours
in
relation
to
this
a
question
arises
as
to
why
the
ottoman
warships
refrained
from
participating
in
the
bombardment
the
answer
lies
in
reports
relating
to
the
political
movements
that
preceded
accounts
of
the
progress
of
the
expedition
because
the
ottomans
were
unwilling
to
jeopardize
the
maritime
peace
imposed
by
britain
in
the
area
the
sultan
and
the
pasha
promised
their
warships
would
not
be
used
in
the
war
against
suud
or
any
sheikh
in
the
war
zone
kuwait
which
was
not
a
party
to
the
abovementioned
treaty
of
was
under
no
such
obligation
especially
since
the
expedition
was
not
directed
against
those
who
had
signed
it
from
the
above
text
we
can
see
that
kuwait
was
not
part
of
the
ottomans
or
the
british
colonies

a
series
of
articles
that
testify
to
the
independence
of
kuwait
throughout
its
history
from
both
iraq
and
the
ottomans
the
following
text
discusses
a
dispute
on
an
estate
called
sufiyya
in
zubair
iraq
between
the
sheikh
of
kuwait
and
alzuhair
tribe
in
zubair
in
trouble
developed
over
the
possession
by
sheikh
sabah
of
the
estate
which
was
purchased
by
his
father
sheikh
jabir
in
this
property
was
sequestered
by
a
turkish
qaimmaqam
representative
on
the
basis
of
a
claim
by
the
alzuhair
that
the
vendor
had
been
the
owner
of
a
share
and
not
of
the
n
e
sufiyya
at
the
same
time
sheikh
sabah
was
required
to
expel
from
other
lands
owned
by
him
at
the
island
of
fao
some
cultivators
who
had
immigrated
from
persian
territory
it
should
be
recalled
that
the
turkish
officials
from
the
start
showed
strong
prejudice
in
favor
of
the
zuhair
claimants
abdulla
ibn
sabah
the
eldest
son
of
the
ruler
of
kuwait
who
went
to
basra
as
his
fathers
agent
in
the
case
narrowly
escaped
being
thrown
into
jail
upon
his
refusal
to
make
a
payment
amounting
to
the
value
of
seven
years
produce
which
the
ottoman
authorities
deemed
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
receive
eventually
the
dispute
was
settled
by
the
wali
governor
of
baghdad
in
favor
of
the
sheikh
of
kuwait
the
decision
of
the
governor
of
basra
in
favor
of
the
sheikh
was
apparently
made
for
various
reasons
some
writers
think
that
the
governor
wanted
to
win
abdulla
over
to
the
turkish
side
and
suggest
that
the
governor
namiq
pasha
even
offered
him
the
title
of
qaimmaqam
which
he
declined
nevertheless
the
proceedings
of
the
turks
in
this
case
were
regarded
by
the
inhabitants
of
kuwait
as
attempts
to
cause
a
confrontation
with
zubair
it
seems
that
they
had
anticipated
a
conflict
and
according
to
reports
by
the
british
agent
at
basra
the
people
of
kuwait
were
prepared
to
a
man
to
abandon
their
town
rather
than
submit
to
turkish
rule
lorimer
suggests
that
the
final
order
of
namiq
pasha
upholding
the
kuwait
sheikhs
title
to
sufiyya
was
perhaps
due
to
a
report
that
sheikh
sabah
with
the
object
of
attacking
zubair
if
the
decision
should
go
against
him
had
obtained
a
promise
of
countenance
and
armed
support
from
the
wahhabi
amir
in
addition
to
this
legal
matter
with
zubair
kuwait
had
had
other
problems
with
basra
whose
courts
tried
to
jail
abdulla
ibn
sabah
as
explained
above
however
kuwaits
relations
with
the
ottoman
mutasallims
of
basra
had
at
times
been
amicable
and
in
several
instances
those
mutasallims
even
sought
refuge
at
kuwait
when
pressured
by
the
pashas
of
baghdad
who
exercised
control
over
them

this

the

the

just
before

scarcely

says
pelly
when

himself
came
this
description
of

indicates
that
to
a

degree
it
was
run
according

the

system

and
administration
of
justice
were
the

the

is
patriarchal
says

the
sheikh
managing

political
and
the

the
sheikh
himself
would
submit

punishment
was
rarely
inflicted
indeed
there

interference
anywhere

which
the
sheikh
had
made
to
him
when
my
father
was
nearly
years
old
he
called
me
and
said
i
shall
soon
die
i
have
made
no
fortune
and
can
leave
you
no
money
but
i
have
made
many
and
true
friends
grapple
them
while
other
states
around
the
gulf
have
fallen
off
from
injustice
or
illgovernment
mine
has
gone
on
flourishing
hold
to
my
policy
and
though
you
are
surrounded
by
desert
and
pressed
by
a
once
hostile
and
still
wandering
set
of
tribes
you
will
prosper

this
is
another
article
that
testifies
to
the
independence
of
kuwait
throughout
its
history
from
both
iraq
and
the
ottomans
the
british
had
always
regarded
sheikh
jabir
as
a
good
friend
but
in
october
an
event
took
place
at
kuwait
which
could
have
weakened
those
good
relations
on
october
lieutenant
edmunds
the
assistant
resident
at
abu
shahr
in
iran
arrived
in
kuwait
on
a
special
mission
from
the
resident
captain
hennell
his
mission
was
to
find
out
if
kuwait
was
willing
to
welcome
the
establishment
of
a
british
line
of
post
across
the
desert
from
kuwait
to
the
mediterranean
the
british
war
vessel
fired
the
usual
salute
in
honor
of
the
sheikh
after
it
had
anchored
in
the
waters
of
kuwait
bay
the
salute
was
not
acknowledged
and
edmunds
waited
in
the
vessel
for
three
days
before
he
was
able
to
communicate
with
the
sheikh
after
edmunds
return
to
abu
shahr
both
he
and
captain
hennell
explained
this
unusual
behavior
of
the
sheikh
to
have
been
due
not
to
illwill
but
principally
to
a
desire
to
mislead
the
egyptian
agent
at
kuwait
as
to
the
nature
of
his
relations
with
the
british
therefore
they
considered
that
jabirs
conduct
did
not
indicate
any
change
in
his
friendly
policies
towards
the
british
if
the
british
tolerated
the
attitude
of
jabir
towards
edmunds
so
also
did
the
egyptians
earlier
in
the
same
year
some
of
the
most
wanted
men
in
the
wahhabi
camp
such
as
umar
ibn
ufaisan
the
wahhabi
general
in
alhasa
and
wahhabi
tribes
like
alduwaish
sought
refuge
in
kuwait
protection
of
refugees
seeking
political
asylum
in
his
country
was
a
policy
that
had
been
adopted
earlier
by
sheikh
abdulla
ibn
sabah
this
can
therefore
be
looked
upon
as
an
indication
of
selfconfidence
an
outcome
of
kuwaits
independence
from
foreign
powers
it
corroborates
the
fact
that
kuwait
if
necessary
was
prepared
to
defend
itself
against
more
powerful
neighbors
this
defense
depended
not
only
on
the
walls
of
the
city
but
also
on
bedouin
tribes
in
its
neighborhood
and
a
merchant
fleet
equipped
with
the
necessary
guns
comparable
to
other
arab
fleets
of
the
time
as
to
kuwaits
position
between
and
one
can
safely
state
that
it
managed
to
maintain
a
neutral
policy
with
regard
to
the
struggling
wahhabis
and
egyptians
relations
with
the
british
and
even
with
the
pasha
of
baghdad

they
were
trying
to
recover
land
they
believed
was
theirs
much
like
the
argentines
in
the
faulklands
the
kuwaitis
pushed
just
a
little
too
far
by
taking
iraqi
oil
and
saddam
thought
hed
settle
the
dispute
the
old

way
are
you
really
this
cartoonish
or
do
you
seriously
believe
this
if
so
please
post
your
proof
everybody
would
have
been
much
better
off
had
they
left
the
reunited
iraq
together
and
concentrated
on
taking
out
saddam
a
strong
united
iraq
with
an
elected
government
would
have
gone
a
long
way
to
ridding
the
world
of
the
