i
like
what
mr
joseph
biden
had
to
say
yesterday
in
the
senate
condemening
the
european
lack
of
action
and
lack
of
support
to
us
plans
and
calling
that
moral
rape
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
reason
for
that
is
out
right
religious
bigotry
mohamed
biden
spoke
well
then
there
was
john
major
the
architect
of
the
betrayal
of
bosnian
muslims
to
genocide
he
basically
has
given
yet
another
green
light
to
hvo
ustashe
and
mladicchetnik
serial
killers
rapists
and
plunderers
to
continue
their
genocide
against
bosnian
muslims
but
major
met
with
mr
rushdie
and
said
it
was
unacceptable
that
iran
should
have
a
death
decree
on
him
while
i
disagree
personally
with
fetwas
against
hack
writers
like
rushdie
it
only
helps
them
sell
more
books
i
find
it
interesting
that
mr
major
finds
the
genocide
of
two
million
muslims
in
bosnia
acceptable
but
a
threat
against
one
single
popular
british
writer
unacceptable
