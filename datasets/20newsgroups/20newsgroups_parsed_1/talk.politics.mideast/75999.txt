the
readers
of
this
forum
seemed
to
be
more
interested
in
the
contents
of
those
files
so
it
will
be
nice
if
yigal
will
tell
us
why
do
american
authorities
consider
yigal
arens
to
be
dangerous
adl
authorities
seem
to
view
a
lot
of
people
as
dangerous
including
the
millions
of
americans
of
arab
ancestry
perhaps
you
can
answer
the
question
as
to
why
the
adl
maintained
files
and
spied
on
adc
members
in
california
and
elsewhere
friendly
rivalry
perhaps
come
on
most
if
not
all
arabs
are
sympathetic
to
the
palestinian
war
against
israel
that
is
why
the
adl
monitors
arab
organizations
that
is
the
same
reason
the
us
monitored
communist
organizations
and
soviet
nationals
only
a
few
years
ago
perhaps
yigal
is
a
greenpeace
member
or
the
naacp
or
a
reporter
or
a
member
of
any
of
the
dozens
of
other
political
organizationsethnic
minoritiesoccupations
that
the
adl
spied
on
all
of
these
groups
have
in
the
past
associated
with
or
been
a
part
of
anti
israel
activity
or
propoganda
the
adl
is
simply
monitoring
them
so
that
if
anything
comes
up
they
wont
be
caught
by
surprise
why
does
the
adl
have
an
interest
in
that
person
paranoia
no
that
is
why
world
trade
center
bombings
dont
happen
in
israel
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
world
trade
center
and
why
people
like
zein
isa
palestinian
whose
american
group
planned
to
bow
up
the
israeli
embassy
and
kill
many
jews
are
caught
as
mordechai
levy
of
the
jdl
said
paranoid
jews
live
longer
if
one
does
trust
either
the
us
government
or
the
adl
what
an
additional
information
should
he
send
them
the
names
of
half
the
posters
on
this
forum
unless
they
already
have
them
they
probably
do
