sarajevo
bosniaherzegovina
in
this
land
of
historic
hatreds
a
tiny
jewish
community
is
braving
serbian
shells
to
repay
a
yearold
debt
to
muslims
who
saved
jews
from
the
holocaust
ivica
ceresnjes
president
of
the
jewish
community
of
sarajevo
says
he
and
about
other
jews
chose
to
remain
in
sarajevo
rather
than
leave
for
israel
to
keep
a
feeding
center
in
the
medieval
old
town
district
running
ceresnjes
said
that
was
partly
in
gratitude
to
the
muslims
who
hid
jews
during
the
nazi
occupation
and
partly
to
keep
intact
the
centuriesold
presence
of
jews
living
in
sarajevo
some
with
guns
are
defending
bosnia
but
i
fight
in
bosnia
by
keeping
people
alive
ceresnjes
said
as
a
student
of
balkan
history
ceresnjes
said
he
saw
this
war
coming
and
had
ready
plans
to
evacuate
children
and
the
elderly
a
year
before
the
war
erupted
here
last
april
ceresnjes
said
the
jewish
center
began
stockpiling
supplies
ensuring
everyone
had
passports
and
arranging
for
places
in
israel
and
europe
for
the
evacuees
they
were
so
well
prepared
he
said
that
only
five
days
after
the
shooting
began
the
first
plane
left
of
about
jews
in
bosnia
herzegovina
he
estimates
half
have
left
many
of
those
who
stayed
behind
work
in
sarajevos
downtown
synagogue
which
has
been
turned
into
a
wartime
feeding
center
that
has
so
far
given
away
meals
the
center
which
has
been
shelled
several
times
along
with
most
of
sarajevo
also
runs
a
radio
station
mail
center
and
distributes
food
packages
sent
by
jewish
organizations
around
the
world
while
muslims
and
jews
are
fighting
each
other
in
the
mideast
jews
here
say
theres
a
long
tradition
of
cooperation
intermarriage
and
tolerance
between
the
two
communities
in
sarajevo
that
goes
back
to
centuries
of
turkish
occupation
sarajevos
jews
trace
their
ancestry
back
to
their
expulsion
from
roman
catholic
spain
in
the
community
numbered
more
than
before
world
war
ii
but
only
survived
the
holocaust
which
was
carried
out
by
the
pronazi
croatian
ustache
in
yugoslavia
many
of
the
survivors
were
hidden
