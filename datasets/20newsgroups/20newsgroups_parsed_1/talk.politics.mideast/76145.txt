i
have
previously
posted
quotations
by
irgun
participants
that
totally
destroys
begins
whitewash
i
have
no
particular
desire
to
post
it
yet
again
brendan
normally
you
apparently
think
you
are
some
sort
of
oneman
judge
and
jury
who
so
what
are
you
can
declare
total
victory
and
then
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
applause
but
youve
picked
the
wrong
topic
if
you
think
a
few
rigged
quotations
can
sustain
the
legend
and
lie
of
the
deir
yassin
massacre
i
dont
think
that
you
are
just
making
noise
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
when
it
comes
to
historical
methodology
thats
true
i
try
to
learn
from
people
who
know
more
than
me
not
from
useless
farts
at
the
most
basic
level
you
should
know
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
weighing
evidence
fairly
and
merely
finding
quotations
that
support
your
preset
opinions
of
course
i
have
said
that
more
times
in
this
group
than
anyone
else
id
think
if
you
have
studied
the
history
of
israel
at
all
you
must
know
that
many
of
the
sources
of
your
quotations
have
an
axe
to
grind
and
therefore
you
must
be
very
careful
about
whom
you
quote
for
quite
true
thats
why
i
am
so
careful
in
selecting
quotes
example
meir
pail
whom
you
cite
was
indeed
a
general
a
scholar
and
a
war
hero
but
that
doesnt
mean
everything
that
comes
out
of
his
mouth
is
gold
in
fact
and
here
your
lack
of
experience
shows
pail
is
such
a
fanatic
embittered
leftist
that
much
of
his
oh
bullshit
fanatic
my
bum
prove
your
blah
or
cork
it
antiisrael
blathering
forget
about
antiirgun
blathering
would
be
considered
something
like
treason
in
nonisrael
contexts
but
of
course
you
dont
consider
this
at
all
when
you
find
a
juicy
quotation
that
you
can
use
to
attack
israel
how
would
you
know
what
i
consider
read
my
mind
benny
morris
of
hashomer
hatzair
represents
himself
as
a
scholar
when
he
rehashes
the
old
attacks
on
the
irgun
dont
be
fooled
its
just
the
old
zionist
ideological
catfight
surfacing
as
an
attack
on
the
then
likud
government
if
you
will
look
closely
at
the
section
on
deir
yassin
in
his
book
on
the
war
of
independence
you
will
see
his
indictment
to
be
pure
hot
air
and
this
is
the
best
he
can
do
after
decades
of
digging
for
any
sort
of
damning
evidence
unfortunately
for
him
because
his
book
parades
itself
as
scholarly
he
is
forced
to
put
footnotes
so
you
can
clearly
see
that
his
deir
yassin
account
is
based
on
nothing
i
looked
very
closely
at
a
large
number
of
sources
you
have
no
idea
what
you
are
talking
about
the
deir
yassin
massacre
never
took
place
as
the
propagandists
tell
it
any
more
than
the
sabra
and
shatila
massacres
do
you
get
thats
true
about
the
accounts
of
both
irgun
and
arab
propagandists
like
begin
for
example
the
feeling
people
like
to
blame
the
jews
for
massacres
even
if
no
i
never
got
that
feeling
i
got
rather
opposite
feelings
about
people
like
you
though
they
have
to
make
them
up
it
must
sound
spicy
even
some
jews
like
to
do
it
for
reasons
of
their
own
honesty
perhaps
you
would
explain
the
testimony
from
members
of
the
irgun
to
be
found
in
their
own
handwriting
in
the
irgun
archives
in
tel
aviv
that
the
wounded
arabs
were
killed
that
a
group
of
prisoners
was
massacred
that
lehi
proposed
exterminating
everybody
at
the
preraid
meeting
exactly
what
reasons
can
you
propose
that
this
testimony
should
be
rejected
in
favour
of
begins
please
dont
confuse
any
of
you
deir
yassin
massacre
stuff
with
facts
or
scholarship
you
should
stick
to
begins
version
unless
you
find
something
serious
to
contradict
it
this
is
very
funny
you
carried
on
about
unsupported
evidence
propagandists
axes
to
grind
and
you
end
up
telling
us
to
stick
to
the
account
of
the
leader
of
the
alleged
killers
you
are
obviously
a
hopeless
case
as
everyone
can
plainly
see
