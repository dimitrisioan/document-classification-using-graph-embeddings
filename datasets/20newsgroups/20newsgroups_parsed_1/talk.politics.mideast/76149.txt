final
solution
for
gaza
while
israeli
jews
fete
the
uprising
of
the
warsaw
ghetto
fete
since
this
word
both
formally
and
commonly
refers
to
positivejoyous
events
your
misuse
of
it
here
is
rather
unsettling
they
repress
by
violent
means
the
uprising
of
the
gaza
ghetto
and
attempt
to
starve
the
gazans
i
certainly
abhor
those
israeli
policies
and
attitudes
that
are
abusive
towards
the
palestiniansgazans
given
that
however
there
is
no
comparison
between
the
reality
of
the
warsaw
ghetto
and
in
gaza
the
right
of
the
gazan
population
to
resist
occupation
is
recognized
in
international
law
and
by
any
person
with
a
sense
of
justice
just
as
international
law
recognizes
the
right
of
the
occupying
entity
to
maintain
order
especially
in
the
face
of
elements
that
are
consciously
attempting
to
disrupt
the
civil
structure
ironically
international
law
recognizes
each
of
these
focusses
that
of
the
occupied
and
the
occupier
even
though
they
are
inherently
in
conflict
as
israel
denies
gazans
the
only
two
options
which
are
compatible
with
basic
human
rights
and
international
law
that
of
becoming
israeli
citizens
with
full
rights
or
respecting
their
right
for
selfdetermination
it
must
be
concluded
that
the
israeli
jewish
society
does
not
consider
gazans
full
human
beings
israel
certainly
can
not
and
should
not
continue
its
present
policies
towards
gazan
residents
there
is
however
a
third
alternative
the
creation
and
implementation
of
a
jewish
dhimmi
system
with
gazanspalestinians
as
benignly
protected
citizens
would
you
find
that
as
acceptable
in
that
form
as
you
do
with
regard
to
islams
policies
towards
its
minorities
whether
they
have
some
final
solution
up
their
sleeve
it
is
a
race
then
between
israels
antipalestiniangazan
final
solution
and
the
arab
worlds
antiisraeljewish
final
solution
do
you
favor
one
neither
i
urge
all
those
who
have
slight
human
compassion
to
do
whatever
they
can
to
help
the
gazans
regain
their
full
human
civil
and
political
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled
as
human
beings
since
there
is
justifiable
worry
by
various
parties
that
israel
and
arabpalestinian
final
solution
intentions
exist
isnt
it
important
that
both
israeli
and
palestiniangazan
rights
be
secured
