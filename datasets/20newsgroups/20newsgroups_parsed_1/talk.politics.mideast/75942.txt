said
azerbaijan
had
recovered
the
bodies
of
some
terrorists
including
blacks
mongols
and
fighters
recently
brought
to
the
armenian
capital
yerevan
from
lebanon
you
can
dream
whatever
you
wish
we
have
demands
from
the
armenians
with
the
government
of
xsoviet
armenia
we
would
sit
down
go
over
all
our
outstanding
issues
whether
its
land
or
reparations
or
recognition
whatever
it
is
wed
like
to
sit
down
and
ask
for
it
by
all
means
lands
and
properties
were
taken
away
from
us
and
they
should
be
returned
to
the
rightful
owners
the
turkish
and
kurdish
people
who
were
there
years
long
before
the
armenians
ever
showed
up
in
that
area
entire
population
of
the
region
was
subjected
to
genocide
beyond
belief
genocide
which
was
planned
to
exterminate
the
whole
turkish
people
of
the
region
to
the
last
man
woman
and
child
armenians
tortured
and
massacred
millions
of
defenseless
civilians
to
assemble
innocent
civilians
in
the
mosques
and
burn
them
in
the
buildings
was
one
of
their
methods
even
today
the
traveler
in
that
region
is
seldom
free
from
the
evidence
of
these
armenian
crimes
if
you
have
the
stomach
i
would
strongly
recommend
the
following
references
on
the
armenian

of
