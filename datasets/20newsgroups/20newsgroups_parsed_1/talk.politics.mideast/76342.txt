i
am
sick
and
tired
of
this
driving

sentance
attributed
to

it
simply
cant
be
proven

part
of
their

proven
maybe
not
but
it
can
certainly
be
verified
beyond
a
reasonable

this
statement
and
statements
like
it
are
a
matter
of
public
record
before
the
six
day
war
i

nasser

some
other

believe
in
as

as

is
an
islamic

that
protects
the

of

its
inhabitants
under
koranic
law

think
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
hamas
covenant
written
in
you
might
get
a
different
impression
i
have
the
convenant
in
the
original
arabic
with
a
translation
that
ive
verified
with
arabic
speakers
the
document
is
rife
with
calls
to
kill
jews
and
spread
islam
and
so
