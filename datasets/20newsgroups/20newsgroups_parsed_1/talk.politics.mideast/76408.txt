writes
you
know
ed
youre
right
andi
shouldnt
be
comparing
israel
to
the
nazis
the
israelis
are
much
worse
than
the
nazis
ever
were
anyway
the
nazis
did
a
lot
of
good
for
germany
and
they
would
have
succeeded
if
it
werent
for
the
damn
jews
the
holocaust
never
happened
anyway
ample
evidence
given
by
george
schafer
at
harvard
dept
of
history
and
even
by
randolph
higgins
at
nyu
have
shown
that
the
holocaust
was
just
a
semitic
conspiracy
created
to
obtain
sympathy
to
piush
for
the
creation
of
israel
just
kidding
be
careful
rjs
when
people
start
finding
humour
in
the
holocaust
they
often
run
the
danger
of
exposing
themselves
for
the
hateful
refuse
that
they
really
are
harry
