perfectly
possible
to
have
objections
to
a
particular
policy
while
feeling
that
there
is
no
alternative
choice
sealing
off
the
gaza
strip
has
the
interesting
sideeffect
of
demonstrating
the
nonviability
of
gaza
as
an
independent
state
where
are
all
of
these
people
going
to
go
to
find
work
if
they
are
separated
from
israel
if
they
complain
about
having
to
show
id
cards
on
the
way
to
work
how
will
they
feel
about
showing
passports
on
the
way
to
work
throughout
the
years
of
the
israelarabpalestinian
conflict
the
internal
palestinian
popultation
has
found
itself
essentially
relegated
to
the
lower
tiers
of
the
economy
given
the
major
kinds
of
positions
required
by
the
israeli
and
the
palestinian
economy
there
are
essentially
two
different
ones
existing
side
by
side
arent
holding
down
many
of
the
skilled
positions
so
when
gaza
has
to
operate
on
its
own
there
are
few
residents
trained
to
fill
the
need
for
middle
and
upper
management
