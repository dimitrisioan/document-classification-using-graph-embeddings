bha
writes
in
resyrias
expansion
the
author
writes
that
the
un
thought
zionism
was
racism
and
that
they
were
wrong
they
were
correct
the
first
time
zionism
is
racism
and
thankfully
the
mcgill
daily
the
student
newspaper
at
mcgill
was
proud
enough
to
print
an
article
saying
so
if
you
want
a
copy
send
me
mail
steve
i
know
this
paper
well
and
see
it
for
the
exercise
in
selective
morality
and
judgement
it
is
until
such
time
as
it
recognizes
that
any
religiously
based
government
is
racist
exclusionary
and
simply
built
on
a
philosophy
of
separate
but
equal
secondclass
treatment
of
minorities
it
will
continue
to
be
known
for
its
bias
if
jewish
nationalism
is
racism
so
is
islam
anywhere
where
people
are
allotted
different
rights
according
to
race
religion
or
culture
is
racist
