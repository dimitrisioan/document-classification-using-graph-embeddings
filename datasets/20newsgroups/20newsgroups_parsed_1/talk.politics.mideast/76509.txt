this
alleged
incident

nothes
just
singing

get
the
best
supporting
singer
i
can
give
you
a
qa
account
that
is
well
documented
just
go
back
and
reread
some
of
the
articles
that
appeared
after
this
joke
q
how
many
antisemites
does
it
take
to
come
up
with
another
antiisraeli
provocation
on
the
net
a
just
one
hell
fabricate
a
lie
and
many
more
will
applaud
i
would
much
prefer
if
mr
steel
would
refrain
from
this
kind
of
jokes
in
the
future
theyre
not
just
offensive
they
also
have
a
very
negative
effect
on
the
state
of
things
between
jews
and
arabs
so
thanks
for
nothing
