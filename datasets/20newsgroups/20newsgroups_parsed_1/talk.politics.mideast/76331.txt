cpr
zionism
and
the
holocaust
by
haim
bresheeth
the
first
point
to
note
regarding
the
appropriation
of
the
history
of
the
holocaust
by
zionist
propaganda
is
that
zionism
without
antisemitism
is
impossible
zionism
agrees
with
the
basic
tenet
of
antisemitism
namely
that
jews
can
not
live
with
non
jews
wrong
zionism
acknowledges
the
fact
that
antisemites
exist
and
prevent
jews
from
living
in
peace
that
does
not
mean
we
agree
that
jews
are
all
greedy
that
jews
kill
christian
children
commited
deicide
or
anything
else
we
acknowledge
that
there
are
morons
out
there
who
do
believe
these
things

if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual
favors
we
sure
wouldnt
waste
them
on
members
