the
readers
of
this
forum
seemed
to
be
more
interested
in
the
contents
of
those
files
so
it
will
be
nice
if
yigal
will
tell
us
why
do
american
authorities
consider
yigal
arens
to
be
dangerous
adl
authorities
seem
to
view
a
lot
of
people
as
dangerous
including
the
millions
of
americans
of
arab
ancestry
perhaps
you
can
answer
the
question
as
to
why
the
adl
maintained
files
and
spied
on
adc
members
in
california
and
elsewhere
friendly
rivalry
perhaps
come
on
most
if
not
all
arabs
are
sympathetic
to
the
palestinian
war
against
israel
that
is
why
the
adl
monitors
arab
organizations
that
is
the
same
reason
the
us
monitored
communist
organizations
and
soviet
nationals
only
a
few
years
ago
the
adc
is
an
organization
of
arabamericans
let
me
seeyoure
saying
that
most
if
not
all
arabamericans
should
be
spied
on
youre
also
saying
that
most
if
not
all
arabamericans
should
be
views
as
a
national
security
threat
to
israel
and
the
us
as
you
gratuitously
imply
in
your
reference
to
the
wtc
bombing
in
which
no
arabamericans
were
involved
by
inference
can
we
assume
that
you
think
that
anyone
of
arab
lineage
anywhere
in
the
world
poses
a
threat
to
israel
and
therefore
should
be
spied
on
like
it
or
not
edward
anwar
has
a
very
good
valid
point
obviously
in
presenting
it
he
quite
legitimately
and
deliberately
takes
a
point
of
view
to
an
extreme
which
might
not
have
been
what
you
intended
but
that
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
demonstrate
a
slippery
slope
type
of
argument
which
i
believe
was
his
aim
i
very
frankly
believe
that
the
adl
will
be
proved
innocent
in
this
case
i
doubt
theres
enough
evidence
to
weigh
against
them
even
in
a
civil
court
where
preponderance
of
the
evidence
not
evidence
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
is
the
standard
for
winning
such
a
case
that
however
does
not
prevent
me
from
seeing
the
merit
in
anwars
point
rest
deleted
how
sad
to
seea
model
of
decorum
and
tranquillitybecome
like
any
other
sport
a
battleground
for
rival
ideologies
to
slug
it
out

glee
