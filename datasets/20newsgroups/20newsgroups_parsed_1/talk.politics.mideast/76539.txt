note
you
are
already
posting
facts
some
of
which
are
outdated
the
biased
presentation
of
facts
as
well
as
the
conclusions
that
you
reach
leave
me
little
hope
of
engaging
in
any
fruitful
exchange
that
might
lead
to
a
meeting
of
the
minds
it
is
to
those
who
read
with
open
mind
that
i
address
myself
the
international
convention
on
the
elimination
of
all
forms
of
racial
discrimination
adopted
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
united
nations
in
has
now
been
ratified
by
most
member
states
article
of
this
convention
defines
the
term
racial
discrimination
as
any
distinction
exclusion
restriction
or
preference
based
on
race
colour
descent
or
national
or
ethnic
origin
which
has
the
purpose
or
effect
of
nullifying
or
impairing
the
recognition
enjoyment
or
exercise
on
an
equal
footing
of
human
rights
and
fundamental
freedoms
in
the
political
economic
social
cultural
or
any
other
field
of
public
life
while
the
ideals
embodied
in
this
text
are
worthy
goals
as
the
text
currently
stands
i
know
of
no
country
in
which
racial
discrimination
of
some
sort
can
not
be
found
it
makes
no
mention
of
the
need
for
for
a
legislative
violation
the
general
assembly
endorsed
in
a
resolution
defining
zionism
as
a
form
of
racism
and
racial
discrimination
the
important
correct
and
legitimate
resolution
is
incomplete
since
it
does
not
include
operative
statements
designed
to
end
israeli
racial
discrimination
meanwhile
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
israel
are
exerting
heavy
pressure
on
member
states
of
the
united
nations
to
repeal
this
resolution
and
give
israeli
racial
practices
zionism
moral
legitimacy
if
you
are
in
principle
advocating
un
intervention
via
operative
statements
in
this
case
it
must
therefore
hold
that
they
can
be
applied
to
any
other
case
where
the
council
perceives
some
form
of
racial
discrimination
as
previously
exhibited
scarey
thought
the
very
definition
of
israel
as
a
state
belonging
to
the
jews
of
the
world
but
not
to
its
inhabitants
alienates
all
native
nonjews
born
in
that
country
actually
i
know
quite
a
few
native
nonjews
born
in
israel
that
are
not
alienated
by
this
law
if
you
had
said
some
you
would
probably
be
correct
however
your
tendency
to
exagerate
and
slant
facts
becomes
apparent
this
slant
permeates
the
text
practically
all
nonjews
who
are
living
in
or
originate
from
areas
under
israeli
control
identify
themselves
as
palestinians
most
of
them
are
muslim
many
are
christian
a
few
jews
including
the
author
of
these
lines
also
identify
themselves
as
palestinians
the
above
statement
is
not
true
practically
all
discounting
beduins
circassians
druze
and
some
other
fringe
groups
your
own
identification
is
a
matter
that
has
no
bearing
upon
the
issue
you
could
equally
identify
yourself
as
a
insert
group
zionism
took
off
in
europe
at
the
end
of
last
century
its
aim
was
to
create
a
jewish
state
in
palestine
in
spite
of
the
adamant
opposition
of
palestinian
arabs
of
the
population
if
i
recall
correctly
at
the
time
zionism
took
off
there
was
no
adamant
opposition
in
palestine
i
am
open
to
any
factual
contradictory
evidence
but
the
zionists
were
more
powerful
militarily
economically
and
technologically
and
succeeded
in
in
conquering
of
the
area
of
mandatory
palestine
after
driving
into
exile
most
native
arabs
from
the
conquered
areas
approximately
people
and
razing
most
of
their
villages
to
the
ground
the
zionists
could
finally
establish
a
predominantly
jewish
state
only
nonjews
remained
on
israeli
territory
do
you
therefore
contend
that
the
villages
you
mention
further
on
most
of
their
villages
once
the
jewish
state
was
established
it
began
enacting
laws
to
help
the
confiscation
of
land
from
native
nonjews
their
political
repression
and
their
destitution
there
is
no
doubt
that
laws
passed
provided
a
framework
which
was
later
used
for
these
purposes
however
you
seem
to
imply
that
this
was
the
intention
a
priori
which
implies
a
policy
and
agenda
my
knowledge
was
that
this
was
not
the
case
you
also
neglect
to
mention
the
circumstances
that
surrounded
this
as
you
do
again
below
in
the
state
of
israel
invaded
egypt
and
syria
and
occupied
the
rest
of
palestine
the
west
bank
and
the
gaza
strip
thus
another
million
palestinians
fell
under
its
juridiction
its
occupation
of
palestinian
and
other
arab
territories
is
considered
illegal
by
the
international
community
as
reflected
in
security
council
resolutions
israel
has
rejected
all
un
resolutions
and
began
without
delay
to
entrench
its
occupation
and
rule
over
these
territories
with
the
aim
of
annexing
them
at
the
appropriate
time
not
quite
accurate
israel
has
not
rejected
all
the
resolutions
though
it
has
conflicting
understanding
with
regards
to
some
of
them
israel
never
annexed
the
sinai
west
bank
or
gaza
the
other
annexations
were
brought
about
partly
due
to
the
un
resolutions
part
of
these
territores
east
jerusalem
and
the
golan
heights
have
already
been
forcefully
annexed
by
israel
in
defiance
of
international
law
and
un
resolutions
out
of
curiousity
provided
that
the
annexees
are
granted
citizenship
what
intl
law
do
you
claim
prohibits
annexation
of
territories
captured
in
war
has
this
ever
been
applied
to
any
other
country
previously
other
than
iraq
it
must
be
emphasized
that
although
these
people
live
under
different
regimes
they
are
united
in
their
selfperception
as
palestinians
that
is
as
people
identifying
with
palestine
a
territorial
entity
not
an
ethnic
or
religious
entity
incorrect
palestinians
themselves
claim
to
be
discriminated
against
on
an
ethnic
or
racial
basis
therefore
your
above
statement
is
incorrect
i
also
note
that
given
the
previous
definition
of
racial
discrimination
the
only
means
that
you
could
argue
for
that
is
nationalistically
however
no
such
nation
has
existed
it
definitely
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
creation
of
israel
in
which
case
you
can
not
argue
racial
discrimination
during
that
period
furthermore
palestinians
generally
consider
the
plo
both
as
a
symbol
of
national
identity
and
as
the
unchallenged
authority
that
represents
them
in
world
affairs
once
again
some
do
some
dont
the
nonjewish
population
living
in
the
palestinian
and
other
arab
territories
occupied
by
israel
in
suffers
not
only
blatant
discrimination
but
is
subject
to
brutal
military
occupation
another
generalization
but
then
again
you
dont
seem
to
care
about
anyone
other
than
the
palestinian
people
whose
cause
you
espouse
licence
to
start
a
business
and
to
buy
industrial
equipment
the
right
to
educate
children
all
of
these
basic
rights
are
subject
to
arbitrary
rulings
by
military
authorities
and
can
not
be
challenged
in
court
incorrect
once
again
they
have
the
ability
to
appeal
furthermore
although
you
may
not
agree
with
them
not
all
of
the
military
rulings
are
senseless
or
arbitrary
some
are
but
this
is
not
due
to
the
whims
of
the
military
as
much
as
the
sizeof
the
taskorganization
only
jewish
inhabitants
of
the
occupied
territories
are
permitted
to
carry
firearms
incorrect
once
again
i
know
two
arab
policemen
who
lived
in
daheisha
and
there
were
more
of
course
with
the
outbreak
of
the
intifada
they
were
forced
by
the
locals
to
resign
bitterly
jewish
settlers
have
right
to
more
water
per
person
than
nonjews
jewish
residents
of
these
territories
number
now
about
people
it
is
israel
governmentus
policy
to
increase
this
number
substantially
in
total
defiance
of
international
law
un
resolutions
and
the
will
of
the
population
the
state
of
israel
systematically
confiscates
land
from
nonjewish
inhabitants
of
these
territories
for
jewish
settlement
that
is
no
longer
true
and
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
your
purpose
iswas
in
posting
this
some
people
in
israel
properare
not
jews
most
of
them
consider
themselves
palestinians
with
israeli
citizenship
for
many
years
after
the
establishment
of
israel
they
were
subjected
to
harsh
military
control
much
of
their
land
was
confiscated
by
the
state
and
handed
to
jewish
organisations
for
exclusive
jewish
settlement
they
have
been
subject
to
massacres
destitution
and
humiliation
while
they
enjoy
with
jewish
israelis
the
right
to
vote
they
are
discriminated
against
both
through
law
and
in
practice
once
again
to
hell
with
the
other
minorities
that
dont
fit
in
right
their
are
many
villages
who
did
not
suffer
in
the
way
you
seem
to
indicate
abu
gosh
comes
to
mind
yes
some
did
but
as
a
result
of
what
actions
approximately
of
the
surface
of
the
state
of
israel
within
the
rgreen
lines
is
for
all
purposes
closed
to
palestinians
who
are
secondclass
citizens
in
israel
they
may
neither
legally
live
on
such
land
nor
rent
or
cultivate
it
a
direct
effect
of
these
policies
is
that
native
nonjewish
citizens
of
israel
are
denied
residence
and
membership
rights
in
most
rural
communities
in
israel
including
the
collective
settlements
kibbutzim
nonjews
are
discriminated
against
in
many
other
ways
the
government
starves
local
authorities
of
palestinian
villages
and
townships
of
funds
jewish
city
councils
force
palestinians
to
live
in
ghettos
jewish
families
receive
higher
child
allocations
than
their
nonjewish
neighbors
palestinian
schools
suffer
underfunding
and
understaffing
as
compared
to
jewish
schools
palestinian
children
are
denied
the
right
to
learn
their
history
and
literature
israelis
who
struggle
for
equal
rights
and
for
the
end
of
racial
discrimination
suffer
continuous
harassment
by
the
authorities
there
are
some
kibbutzim
with
arabnonjewish
members
it
is
up
to
the
members
of
the
kibbutz
there
is
no
legislation
against
it
nor
against
a
purely
nonjewish
collective
funds
are
the
result
of
political
lobbying
bearing
in
mind
that
nonjews
compose
of
the
voting
population
it
has
never
failed
to
amaze
me
that
they
fail
to
form
one
large
bloc
and
increase
their
power
the
recent
elections
are
a
case
in
point
please
provide
factual
evidence
supporting
your
allegation
with
regard
to
educational
material
you
have
obviously
never
seen
the
curriculum
of
a
school
in
the
west
bank
it
is
based
upon
jordans
school
system
with
regard
to
your
last
statement
it
is
simply
another
gross
generalization
the
state
of
israel
refuses
to
acknowledge
itself
as
the
state
of
all
its
inhabitants
although
the
israeli
cabinet
has
never
openly
endorsed
the
transfer
idea
the
forced
removal
from
the
country
of
its
native
palestinian
population
that
is
its
ultimate
judaization
israeli
government
policies
towards
nonjews
bear
the
mark
of
this
final
solution
no
attempt
is
made
by
the
zionist
authorities
to
integrate
palestinian
arabs
into
israeli
public
life
thus
although
comprising
approximately
of
the
population
of
israeli
citizens
no
palestinian
citizen
of
israel
has
ever
served
as
cabinet
member
as
director
of
ministry
or
of
a
national
institution
as
judge
of
the
supreme
court
as
ambassador
of
israel
or
in
any
leading
position
in
israeli
economic
or
financial
life
even
the
director
of
the
ministry
for
arab
affairs
yes
such
a
thing
exists
is
a
jew
another
generalization
but
lets
not
stop
here
the
transfer
idea
was
espoused
by
one
party
in
the
last
govt
moledet
it
was
intended
to
be
a
solution
to
the
problem
in
the
territories
not
the
country
itself
with
regard
to
other
items
i
recall
at
least
one
arab
ambassador
and
the
rest
was
covered
previously
although
sexual
relations
between
and
cohabitation
of
jews
and
nonjews
are
legal
they
are
considered
by
israelizionist
society
somewhat
a
betrayal
of
the
jewish
and
zionist
ethics
the
israeli
educational
system
nurtures
this
attitude
in
a
systematic
way
when
was
the
last
time
you
were
in
israel
that
is
simply
not
true
nor
has
it
been
for
quite
some
time
the
question
of
religious
intervention
is
best
answered
by
the
proportional
representation
and
the
lack
of
any
arab
party
bloc
to
counter
the
orthodox
one
zionism
rejects
the
idea
of
a
modern
secular
state
based
on
equality
of
all
citizens
this
is
one
main
reason
why
israel
has
not
produced
any
written
constitution
simply
incorrect
the
answer
is
political
once
again
your
failure
to
understand
the
dynamics
and
movements
inside
israeli
govt
relegates
your
contentions
to
the
sidelines
zionism
predicates
a
state
where
jews
have
privileged
rights
thus
according
to
israeli
law
a
jew
born
in
london
who
has
never
visited
israel
does
not
speak
hebrew
and
professes
atheism
is
granted
automatic
israeli
citizenship
while
native
palestinian
inhabitants
who
happen
to
be
christian
or
muslim
are
treated
almost
as
aliens
racial
discrimination
as
defined
in
international
law
is
thus
not
only
reflected
in
israeli
laws
and
policies
but
is
grounded
in
the
very
nature
of
israel
as
a
jewish
state
but
the
discrimination
is
not
based
upon
race
oops
sorry
nasty
habit
i
have
of
countering
malicious
false
truths
any
proposal
for
israeliarab
and
israelipalestinian
peace
that
does
not
address
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
by
israel
that
is
the
zionist
nature
of
the
state
of
israel
is
thus
doomed
to
fail
real
world
intrusion
any
proposal
that
does
is
doomed
to
fail
of
course
i
wouldnt
expect
you
to
understand
wrapped
up
as
you
are
in
your
view
of
things
lets
not
let
anything
penetrate
shall
we
i
may
be
a
bit
too
sarcastic
but
there
is
a
limit

the
amount
