unconventional
peace
proposal
a
unconventional
proposal
for
peace
in
the
middleeast
by
elias
davidsson
this
could
be
accomplished
by
other
criteria
one
must
remember
that
children
often
bring
stress
into
households
as
an
alternative
one
could
consider
financial
incentives
for
every
sexual
act
performed
by
two
partners
of
different
ethnic
backgrounds
the
plan
could
be
entitled
peace
income
sexual
security
or
piss
for
short
every
time
an
israeli
gets
screwed
by
a
palestinian
or
visa
versa
they
would
be
eligible
for
income
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
condoms
would
be
a
tax
deductible
expense
this
policy
does
not
discriminate
on
a
gender
basis
nor
would
it
apply
to
domestic
animals
of
either
nationality
joint
palestinanisraeli
teams
would
be
obligated
to
ensure
that
all
acts
were
voluntary
and
promptly
rewarded
the
teams
of
palestinianisrael
morals
patrols
or
pimps
would
receive
a
percentage
of
the
financial
income
in
order
to
encourage
their
participation
and
add
to
their
incentive
in
locating
suitable
candidates
i
would
be
thankful
for
critical
comments
to
the
above
proposal
as
well
for
any
dissemination
of
this
proposal
for
meaningful
shouldnt
that
be
insemination
