this
is
actually
the
law
that
david
irving
will
hopefully
be
found
guilty
under
due
to
his
denial
of
the
holocaust
its
too
bad
that
this
useless
centre
for
policy
research
isnt
in
canada
itd
set
a
nice
precedent
to
how
the
law
applies
in
cyberspace
in
article

beyer
responds
well
canada
is
wrong
talk
about
generalizations
indeed
you
do
sound
quite
immature
if
it
was
in
the
us
the
aclu
would
have
made
sure
that
such
repressive
laws
are
found
unconstitutional
what
the
aclu
fighting
against
an
antihate
law
you
mean
that
the
aclu
would
support
gaybashing
racial
discrimination
and
antisemitic
violence
thanks
andi
for
reminding
us
that
the
constitution
preserves
our
rights
to
such
fun
activities
do
you
think
the
church
didnt
find
galileos
perception
of
the
universe
offensive
probably
but
galileo
happened
to
be
right
jews
are
offended
by
the
holocaust
deniers
too
the
revisionists
who
deny
that
history
even
happened
happen
to
be
wrong

years
