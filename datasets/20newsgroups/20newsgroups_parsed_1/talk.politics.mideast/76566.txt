article
tsiel

says
i
agree
with
all
you
write
except
that
terrorist
orgs
were
not
shelling
israel
from
the
golan
heights
in
but
rather
from
lebanon
the
golan
heights
have
been
held
by
israel
since
and
therefore
the
plo
could
not
have
been
shelling
israel
from
there
unless
there
is
something
i
am
not
aware
of
oopssmall
mistake
thanks
for
mentioning
it
i
just
read
on
theisraelline
that
a
village
just
got
shelled
by
terrorists
last
week
and
some
children
were
killed
i
guess
the
terrorists
must
have
gotten
by
the
security
zone
just
think
at
how
much
more
shelling
would
be
happening
if
the
security
zone
werent
there
