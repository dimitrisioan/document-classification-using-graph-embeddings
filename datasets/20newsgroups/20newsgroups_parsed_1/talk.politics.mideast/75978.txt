now
if
actions
of
the
lebanese
resistance
help
send
the
isrealis
packing
im
all
for
it
if
you
are
really
concerned
about
bloodshed
a
little
self
criticism
could
do
you
a
great
favor
one
of
these
days
youll
learn
that
the
way
to
stop
israel
from
fighting
back
is
to
stop
attacking
if
there
were
no
attacks
in
the
security
zone
for
a
year
because
the
lebanese
army
could
maintain
the
peace
then
lebanon
would
be
in
much
better
shape
tell
me
something
though
why
do
syrian
troops
not
get
attacked
arent
they
occupying
lebanon
israel
has
repeatedly
stated
that
it
will
leave
on
two
conditions
one
is
a
demonstration
that
the
lebanese
army
can
keep
the
peace
the
second
is
that
the
syrians
pull
out
as
well

if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual
favors
we
sure
wouldnt
waste
them
on
