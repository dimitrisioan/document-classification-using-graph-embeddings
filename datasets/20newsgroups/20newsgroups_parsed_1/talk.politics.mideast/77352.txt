will

a

as
in

past
in
xsoviet
armenia
and
today
in
azerbaijan
for
utopic
and
idiotic
causes
the
armenians
brought
havoc
to
their
neighbors
a
shortsighted
and
misplaced
nationalistic
fervor
with
a
wrong
agenda
and
anachronistic
methods
the
armenians
continue
to
become
pernicious
for

they
will

by

nagornokarabag
is
a
mountainous
enclave
that
lies
completely
within
azerbaijan
with
no
border
or
history
whatsoever
connected
to
xsoviet
armenia
besides
the
geographical
aspect
nagornokarabag
is
the
historic
homeland
and
the
cradle
of
the
artistic
and
literary
heritage
of
azerbaijan
which
renders
the
armenian
claims
preposterous
even
lunatic
no
one
in
his
or
her
mind
could
have
imagined
that
one
day
such
a
devious
turn
of
event
could
have
plagued
the
azeris
one
can
not
even
imagine
the
reverse
case
to
occur
for
the
armenians
either
would
have
slaughtered
the
azerbaijanis
or
put
them
to
forced
exile
to
maintain
their
own
majority
where
was
she
an
appeal
to
mankind
during
the
last
three
years
azerbaijan
and
its
multinational
population
are
vainly
fighting
for
justice
within
the
limits
of
the
soviet
union
all
humanitarian
constitutional
human
rights
guaranteed
by
the
un
charter
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
helsinki
agreements
human
problems
international
forums
documents
signed
by
the
soviet
union
all
of
them
are
violated
the
ussrs
president
government
bodies
do
not
defend
azerbaijan
though
they
are
all
empowered
to
take
necessary
measures
to
guarantee
life
and
peace
the
strong
army
of
armenian
terrorists
with
moscows
tacit
consent
wages
an
undeclared
war
of
annihilation
against
azerbaijan
as
a
result
a
part
of
azerbaijan
has
been
occupied
and
annexed
hundreds
of
people
killed
thousands
wounded
some
azerbaijanis
have
been
brutally
and
inhumanly
deported
from
the
armenian
ssr
their
historical
homeland
together
with
them
russians
and
kurds
have
also
been
driven
out
a
part
of
them
now
settled
in
azerbaijan
some
turkishmeskhetians
lezghins
and
representatives
of
other
caucasian
nationalities
who
escaped
from
the
central
asia
where
the
president
and
government
bodies
did
not
guarantee
them
the
life
and
peace
also
suffered
from
these
deportations
one
of
the
scandalous
vandalisms
directed
not
only
against
azerbaijan
science
but
the
world
civilization
as
well
is
the

its

and

are

its
people
are

there
is
persistent
negative
image
of
azerbaijanians
abroad
and
this
defamation
is
spread
over
the
whole
world
by
soviet
mass
media
armenian
lobby
in
the
ussr
and
the
united
states
one
of
the
myths
is
that
all
events
allegedly
involves
and
generated
by
interethnic
collisions
and
religious
intolerance
while
the
truth
is
that
all
these
shootings
and
recent
events
stem
from
the
territorial
claims
of
armenia
on
azerbaijan
it
is
a
well
documented
fact
that
before
the
conflict
there
were
no
frictions
between
armenians
and
azerbaijanis
on
the
issue
of
karabakh
hundreds
and
thousands
armenians
placidly
and
calmly
lived
and
worked
in
azerbaijan
land
had
their
representatives
in
all
government
bodies
of
the
azerbaijan
ssr
we
are
for
a
united
indivisible
sovereign
azerbaijan
we
are
for
a
common
caucasian
home
proclaimed
in
by
one
of
the
founding
fathers
of
the
azerbaijan
democratic
republic
muhammed
emin
rasulzade
but
all
these
goals
and
expectations
are
trampled
upon
the
soviet
leadership
in
favour
of
the
armenian
expansionists
encouraged
by
moscow
and
intended
to
create
a
new

the
world
public
opinion
shed
tears
to
save
the
whales
suffers
for
penguins
dying
out
in
the
antarctic
continent
but
what
about
the
lives
of
seven
million
human
beings
if
these
people
are
muslims
does
it
mean
that
they
are
less
valuable
can
people
be
discriminated
by
their
colour
of
skin
or
religion
by
their
residence
or
other
attributes
all
people
are
brothers
and
we
appeal
to
our
brothers
for
help
and
understanding
this
is
not
the
first
appeal
of
azerbaijan
to
the
world
public
opinion
our
previous
appeals
were
unheard
however
we
still
carry
the
hope
that
the
truth
beyond
the
russian
and
armenian
propaganda
will
one
day
reveal
the
extent
of
our
suffering
and
stimulate
at
least
as
much
help
and
compassion
for
azerbaijan
as
tendered
to

and

painful
search
the
gruesome
extent
of
februarys
killings
of
azeris
by
armenians
in
the
town
of
hojali
is
at
last
emerging
in
azerbaijan
about
men
women
and
children
dead
in
the
worst
outrage
of
the
fouryear
war
over
nagorny
karabakh
the
figure
is
drawn
from
azeri
investigators
hojali
officials
and
casualty
lists
published
in
the
baku
press
diplomats
and
aid
workers
say
the
death
toll
is
in
line
with
their
own
estimates
the
february
attack
on
hojali
by
armenian
forces
was
one
of
the
last
moves
in
their
fouryear
campaign
to
take
full
control
of
nagorny
karabakh
the
subject
of
a
new
round
of
negotiations
in
rome
on
monday
the
bloodshed
was
something
between
a
fighting
retreat
and
a
massacre
but
investigators
say
that
most
of
the
dead
were
civilians
the
awful
number
of
people
killed
was
first
suppressed
by
the
fearful
former
communist
government
in
baku
later
it
was
blurred
by
armenian
denials
and
griefstricken
azerbaijans
wild
and
contradictory
allegations
of
up
to
dead
the
state
prosecuter
aydin
rasulov
the
cheif
investigator
of
a
man
team
looking
into
what
azerbaijan
calls
the
hojali
disaster
said
his
figure
of
people
dead
was
a
minimum
on
preliminary
findings
a
similar
estimate
was
given
by
elman
memmedov
the
mayor
of
hojali
an
even
higher
one
was
printed
in
the
baku
newspaper
ordu
in
may
dead
people
named
and
more
than
bodies
reported
unidentified
this
figure
of
nearly
dead
is
quoted
as
official
by
leila
yunusova
the
new
spokeswoman
of
the
azeri
ministry
of
defence
francois
zen
ruffinen
head
of
delegation
of
the
international
red
cross
in
baku
said
the
muslim
imam
of
the
nearby
city
of
agdam
had
reported
a
figure
of
bodies
received
at
his
mosque
from
hojali
most
of
them
civilians
we
did
not
count
the
bodies
but
the
figure
seems
reasonable
it
is
no
fantasy
mr
zen
ruffinen
said
we
have
some
idea
since
we
gave
the
body
bags
and
products
to
wash
the
dead
mr
rasulov
endeavours
to
give
an
unemotional
estimate
of
the
number
of
dead
in
the
massacre
dont
get
worked
up
it
will
take
several
months
to
get
a
final
figure
the
yearold
lawyer
said
at
his
small
office
mr
rasulov
knows
about
these
things
it
took
him
two
years
to
reach
a
firm
conclusion
that
people
were
killed
and
wounded
when
soviet
troops
and
tanks
crushed
a
nationalist
uprising
in
baku
in
january
those
nationalists
the
popular
front
finally
came
to
power
three
weeks
ago
and
are
applying
pressure
to
find
out
exactly
what
happened
when
hojali
an
azeri
town
which
lies
about
miles
from
the
border
with
armenia
fell
to
the
armenians
officially
people
have
so
far
been
certified
as
dead
being
the
number
of
people
that
could
be
medically
examined
by
the
republics
forensic
department
this
is
just
a
small
percentage
of
the
dead
said
rafiq
youssifov
the
republics
chief
forensic
scientist
they
were
the
only
bodies
brought
to
us
remember
the
chaos
and
the
fact
that
we
are
muslims
and
have
to
wash
and
bury
our
dead
within
hours
of
these
people
were
women
and
were
children
under
years
old
gunshots
killed
people
shrapnel
killed
and
axes
or
blunt
instruments
killed
exposure
in
the
highland
snows
killed
the
last
three
thirtythree
people
showed
signs
of
deliberate
mutilation
including
ears
noses
breasts
or
penises
cut
off
and
eyes
gouged
out
according
to
professor
youssifovs
report
those
bodies
examined
were
less
than
a
third
of
those
believed
to
have
been
killed
mr
rasulov
said
files
from
mr
rasulovs
investigative
commission
are
still
disorganised
lists
of
azeri
militiamen
are
dead
here
six
policemen
there
and
in
handwriting
of
a
mosque
attendant
the
names
of
corpses
brought
to
be
washed
in
just
one
day
the
most
heartbreaking
account
from
witnesses
interviewed
so
far
comes
from
towfiq
manafov
an
azeri
investigator
who
took
a
helicopter
flight
over
the
escape
route
from
hojali
on
february
there
were
too
many
bodies
of
dead
and
wounded
on
the
ground
to
count
properly
in
hojali
people
by
the
stream
and
the
road
and
visible
around
nakhchivanik
village
mr
manafov
wrote
in
a
statement
countersigned
by
the
helicopter
pilot
people
waved
up
to
us
for
help
we
saw
three
dead
children
and
one
twoyearold
alive
by
one
dead
woman
the
live
one
was
pulling
at
her
arm
for
the
mother
to
get
up
we
tried
to
land
but
armenians
started
a
barrage
against
our
helicopter
and
we
had
to
return
there
has
been
no
consolidation
of
the
lists
and
figures
in
circulation
because
of
the
political
upheavals
of
the
last
few
months
and
the
fact
that
nobody
knows
exactly
who
was
in
hojali
at
the
time
many
inhabitants
were
displaced
from
other
villages
taken
over
by
armenian
forces
the
independent
london
heroes
who
fought
on
amid
the
bodies
aref
sadikov
sat
quietly
in
the
shade
of
a
cafebar
on
the
caspian
sea
esplanade
of
baku
and
showed
a
line
of
stitches
in
his
trousers
torn
by
an
armenian
bullet
as
he
fled
the
town
of
hojali
just
over
three
months
ago
writes
hugh
pope
im
still
wearing
the
same
clothes
i
dont
have
any
others
the
yearold
carpenter
said
beginning
his
account
of
the
hojali
disaster
i
was
wounded
in
five
places
but
i
am
lucky
to
be
alive
mr
sadikov
and
his
wife
were
short
of
food
without
electricity
for
more
than
a
month
and
cut
off
from
helicopter
flights
for
days
they
sensed
the
armenian
noose
was
tightening
around
the
to
people
left
in
the
straggling
azeri
town
on
the
edge
of
karabakh
at
about
pm
a
bombardment
started
such
as
we
had
never
heard
before
eight
or
nine
kinds
of
weapons
artillery
heavy
machineguns
the
lot
mr
sadikov
said
soon
neighbours
were
pouring
down
the
street
from
the
direction
of
the
attack
some
huddled
in
shelters
but
others
started
fleeing
the
town
down
a
hill
through
a
stream
and
through
the
snow
into
a
forest
on
the
other
side
to
escape
the
townspeople
had
to
reach
the
azeri
town
of
agdam
about
miles
away
they
thought
they
were
going
to
make
it
until
at
about
dawn
they
reached
a
bottleneck
between
the
two
armenian
villages
of
nakhchivanik
and
saderak
none
of
my
group
was
hurt
up
to
then
then
we
were
spotted
by
a
car
on
the
road
and
the
armenian
outposts
started
opening
fire
mr
sadikov
said
azeri
militiamen
fighting
their
way
out
of
hojali
rushed
forward
to
force
open
a
corridor
for
the
civilians
but
their
efforts
were
mostly
in
vain
mr
sadikov
said
only
people
from
his
group
of
made
it
through
including
his
wife
and
militiaman
son
seven
of
his
immediate
relations
died
including
his
yearold
elder
brother
i
only
had
time
to
reach
down
and
cover
his
face
with
his
hat
he
said
pulling
his
own
big
flat
turkish
cap
over
his
eyes
we
have
never
got
any
of
the
bodies
back
the
first
groups
were
lucky
to
have
the
benefit
of
covering
fire
one
hero
of
the
evacuation
alif
hajief
was
shot
dead
as
he
struggled
to
change
a
magazine
while
covering
the
third
groups
crossing
mr
sadikov
said
another
hero
elman
memmedov
the
mayor
of
hojali
said
he
and
several
others
spent
the
whole
day
of
february
in
the
bushy
hillside
surrounded
by
dead
bodies
as
they
tried
to
keep
three
armenian
armoured
personnel
carriers
at
bay
as
the
survivors
staggered
the
last
mile
into
agdam
there
was
little
comfort
in
a
town
from
which
most
of
the
population
was
soon
to
flee
the
night
after
we
reached
the
town
there
was
a
big
armenian
rocket
attack
some
people
just
kept
going
mr
sadikov
said
i
had
to
get
to
the
hospital
for
treatment
i
was
in
a
bad
way
they
even
found
a
bullet
in
my
sock
