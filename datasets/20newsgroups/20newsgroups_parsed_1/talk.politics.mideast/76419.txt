israels
expansion
ii
in
article
get
thee
to
a
nunnery
writes
i
have
never
seen
such
immaturity
among
semitophiles
this
andi
beyer
character
shows
no
signs
of
anti
semitism
ok
youve
already
disqualified
yourself
who
ever
you
are
from
being
objective
you
all
are
an
insult
to
you
race
assuming
you
are
also
semitic
jews
are
a
people
with
a
common
cultural
heritage
religion
and
history
we
are
not
a
race
now
i
have
a
comment
concerning
israeli
terrorism
during
the
s
and
s
the
hirgun
and
other
branch
off
militant
groups
did
fight
the
british
do
get
them
out
of
palestine
yet
i
fail
to
see
how
this
israeli
form
of
terrorism
was
better
than
the
terrorism
practiced
now
by
the
arabs
these
jewish
terrorist
groups
killed
innocent
british
soldiers
you
dont
see
a
difference
between
killing
british
soldiers
who
were
preventing
jews
who
tried
to
escape
the
nazis
from
entering
the
british
mandate
and
arab
terrorist
who
kill
civilian
men
women
and
children
i
mention
this
not
because
im
anti
semitic
im
part
jewish
thats
ridiculuous
on
atleast
two
counts
first
of
all
even
if
you
identify
yourself
as
completely
jewish
that
doesnt
rule
out
the
possibility
that
youre
a
selfhating
antisemite
one
can
always
find
jews
who
are
uncomfortable
with
their
identities
since
they
only
want
jews
to
be
cowering
victims
and
are
willing
to
speak
up
for
their
enemies
secondly
the
strength
or
weakness
of
your
arguments
does
not
depend
on
your
identity
