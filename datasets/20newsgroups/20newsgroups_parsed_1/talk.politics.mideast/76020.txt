the
readers
of
this
forum
seemed
to
be
more
interested
in
the
contents
of
those
files
so
it
will
be
nice
if
yigal
will
tell
us
why
do
american
authorities
consider
yigal
arens
to
be
dangerous
adl
authorities
seem
to
view
a
lot
of
people
as
dangerous
including
the
millions
of
americans
of
arab
ancestry
perhaps
you
can
answer
the
question
as
to
why
the
adl
maintained
files
and
spied
on
adc
members
in
california
and
elsewhere
friendly
rivalry
perhaps
perhaps
yigal
is
a
greenpeace
member
or
the
naacp
or
a
reporter
or
a
member
of
any
of
the
dozens
of
other
political
organizationsethnic
minoritiesoccupations
that
the
adl
spied
on
why
does
the
adl
have
an
interest
in
that
person
paranoia
if
one
does
trust
either
the
us
government
or
the
adl
what
an
additional
information
should
he
send
them
the
names
of
half
the
posters
on
this
forum
unless
they
already
have
them
