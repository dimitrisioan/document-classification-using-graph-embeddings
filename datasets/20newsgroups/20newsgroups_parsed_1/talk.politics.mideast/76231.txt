are
you
aware
that
there
is
an
arms
embargo
on
all
of
what
iswas
yugoslavia
including
bosnia
which
guarantees
massive
military
superiority
of
serbian
forces
and
does
not
allow
the
bosnians
to
try
to
defend
themselves
should
we
sell
weapons
to
all
sides
or
just
the
losing
one
then
ending
an
embargo
does
not
we
must
sell
anything
at
all
right
well
probably
end
up
giving
them
weapons
if
the
europeans
want
to
sell
weapons
to
one
or
both
sides
they
are
welcome
as
far
as
im
concerned
you
seem
to
oppose
ending
the
embargo
you
know
it
is
difficult
for
europeans
to
sell
weapons
when
there
is
an
embargo
in
place
during
wwii
the
british
managed
to
supply
arms
to
the
yugoslavs
despite
german
occupation
if
the
europeans
had
the
will
to
do
anything
besides
sponsoring
peace
conferences
they
would
have
no
problem
putting
any
kind
of
weapon
they
wanted
into
bosnia
i
guess
i
would
favor
ending
the
embargo
if
the
congress
would
pass
a
law
forbidding
export
of
us
military
supplies
to
yugoslavia
including
via
third
parties
until
then
the
risks
of
the
us
being
drawn
into
a
more
active
role
would
be
too
great
i
do
not
see
the
arms
embargo
as
a
major
factor
in
the
outcome
of
the
war
i
do
not
automatically
accept
the
argument
that
bosnia
is
any
worse
than
other
recent
civil
wars
say
vietnam
for
instance
the
difference
is
it
is
happening
to
white
people
inside
europe
with
lots
of
tv
coverage
but
if
this
was
the
reason
and
if
furthermore
both
sides
are
equal
wouldnt
all
us
racist
americans
be
favoring
the
good
christians
serbs
instead
of
the
nonchristians
we
really
seem
to
favor
both
sides
are
certainly
not
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
press
and
thats
about
all
we
have
to
go
on
isnt
it
and
i
wish
youd
quit
hurling
words
like
racist
around
there
are
many
levels
at
which
people
react
to
what
they
see
at
the
most
fundamental
level
you
do
not
have
to
consciously
recognize
the
racial
element
you
simply
tend
to
empathize
more
with
people
who
are
like
yourself
as
far
preferring
christian
over
moslem
i
am
an
atheist
myself
and
i
think
youll
agree
that
in
the
us
the
majority
of
people
do
not
typically
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion
nor
give
it
a
particularly
important
place
in
their
world
view
