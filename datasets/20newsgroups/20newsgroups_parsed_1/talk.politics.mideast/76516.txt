a
unconventional
proposal
for
peace
in
the
middleeast
by
elias
davidsson
of
all
the
stupid
postings
youve
brought
here
recently
it
is
illuminating
that
you
chose
to
put
your
own
name
on
perhaps
the
stupidest
of
them
the
following
proposal
is
based
on
the
following
assumptions
fundamental
human
rights
such
as
the
right
to
life
to
education
to
establish
a
family
and
have
children
to
human
dignity
the
right
to
free
movement
to
free
expression
etc
are
more
important
to
human
existence
that
the
rights
of
states
does
this
mean
that
you
are
calling
for
the
dismantling
of
the
arab
states
in
the
event
of
a
conflict
between
basic
human
rights
and
rights
of
collectivities
basic
human
rights
should
prevail
apparently
your
answer
is
yes
attempts
to
solve
the
israeliarab
conflict
by
traditional
political
means
have
failed
attempts
to
solve
these
problem
by
traditional
military
means
and
nontraditional
terrorist
means
has
also
failed
but
that
wont
stop
them
from
trying
again
after
all
it
is
a
holy
war
you
know
as
long
as
the
conflict
is
perceived
as
that
between
two
distinct
ethnicalreligious
communitiespeoples
which
claim
the
land
there
is
no
just
nor
peaceful
solution
possible
no
just
solution
possible
how
very
encouraging
having
stated
my
assumptions
i
will
now
state
my
proposal
you
mean
that
it
gets
even
funnier
a
fund
should
be
established
which
would
disburse
grants
for
each
child
born
to
a
couple
where
one
partner
is
israelijew
and
the
other
palestinianarab
for
the
first
child
the
grant
will
amount
to
for
the
second
the
third
child
for
each
child
for
each
subsequent
child
the
grant
will
amount
to
for
each
child
the
fund
would
be
financed
by
a
variety
of
sources
which
have
shown
interest
in
promoting
a
peaceful
solution
to
the
israeliarab
conflict
no
the
fund
should
be
financed
by
the
center
for
policy
research
it
is
a
major
organization
isnt
it
isnt
it
the
emergence
of
a
considerable
number
of
mixed
marriages
in
israelpalestine
all
of
whom
would
have
relatives
on
both
sides
of
the
divide
would
make
the
conflict
lose
its
ethnical
and
unsoluble
core
and
strengthen
the
emergence
of
a
truly
civil
society
yeah
just
like
marriages
among
arabs
has
strengthened
their
societies
the
existence
of
a
strong
mixed
stock
of
people
would
also
help
the
integration
of
israeli
society
into
the
middleeast
in
a
graceful
manner
the
world
could
do
with
a
bit
less
middle
eastern
grace
objections
to
this
proposal
will
certainly
be
voiced
i
will
attempt
to
identify
some
of
these
boy
youre
a
oneman
band
listen
if
youd
like
to
followup
on
your
own
postings
and
debate
with
yourself
just
tell
us
and
well
leave
you
alone
