eh
could
you
please
give
me
details
about
an
event
where
a
neutral
observer
was
killed
by
purpose
by
an
israeli
soldier
there
are
many
cases
but
i
do
not
remeber
names
the
isralis
shot
and
killed
a
un
observer
in
gaza
in
the
first
half
of
intifada
not
exactly
the
same
but
reminiscent
of
the
assassination
of
count
bernadotte
who
was
the
un
negotiator
during
the
israeli
war
of
independence
he
was
killed
by
the
israelis
seems
he
was
being
too
successful
in
negotiating
a
ceasefire
which
would
have
worked
territorially
against
the
nascent
israel
compared
to
continued
war
