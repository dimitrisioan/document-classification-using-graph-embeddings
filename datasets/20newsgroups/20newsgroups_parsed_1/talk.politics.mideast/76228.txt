i
must
say
i
was
appalled
by
the
american
jewish
councils
open
letter
america
is
not
the
worlds
policeman
we
can
not
and
should
not
take
it
upon
ourselves
to
solve
the
problems
of
the
entire
world
americas
young
men
and
women
should
not
be
sent
to
yugoslavia
period
if
people
feel
strongly
enough
let
them
go
as
individuals
to
fight
alongside
the
butchers
of
their
choice
we
have
a
volunteer
army
the
argument
you
gave
only
applies
if
we
have
a
draft
huh
sorry
i
misread
your
remark
about
young
men
and
women
though
i
am
now
unsure
what
that
sentence
does
mean
furthermore
people
do
not
become
butchers
by
being
ethnic
cleansed
or
do
you
automatically
call
them
butchers
because
they
are
muslim
i
am
disappointed
in
your
logic
especially
coming
from
a
stalwart
of
sciskeptic
you
implied
that
anyone
who
wants
to
send
troops
to
bosnia
wants
to
do
so
to
help
the
butchers
of
their
choice
since
the
primary
targets
of
help
are
muslim
victims
of
ethnic
cleansing
you
imply
that
such
muslim
victims
are
butchers
people
become
butchers
by
butchering
there
have
been
atrocities
on
all
sides
this
implies
both
sides
are
equal
true
it
may
sometimes
be
difficult
or
impossible
to
determine
which
side
is
the
victim
but
that
does
not
mean
that
victims
do
not
exist
would
you
in
wwii
have
said
that
there
were
atrocities
on
the
sides
of
both
the
jews
and
the
germans
these
people
have
been
butchering
each
other
for
centuries
when
one
side
wins
and
gets
what
it
wants
it
will
stop
yes
but
both
sides
want
different
things
the
muslims
chiefly
want
to
not
be
ethnic
cleansed
the
serbians
want
to
ethnic
cleanse
the
muslims
it
is
indeed
true
that
each
side
will
stop
when
it
gets
what
it
wants
but
the
things
that
the
two
sides
want
are
not
equivalent
quite
an
impressive
leap
of
reasoning
to
assume
that
i
am
so
racist
as
to
call
someone
a
butcher
because
they
are
muslim
in
fact
i
think
on
the
contrary
the
media
fixation
on
this
war
as
opposed
to
the
dozens
upon
dozens
of
civil
wars
which
have
been
fought
in
the
recent
past
is
because
these
are
white
people
in
europe
when
atrocities
occur
in
the
third
world
there
is
not
as
much
news
coverage
and
not
nearly
the
same
level
of
outrage
i
recall
before
we
did
anything
for
somalia
apparent
leftwingers
saying
that
the
reason
everyone
was
more
willing
to
send
troops
to
bosnia
than
to
somalia
was
because
the
somalis
are
thirdworlders
who
americans
consider
unworthy
of
help
they
suddenly
shut
up
when
the
us
decided
to
send
troops
to
the
opposite
place
than
that
predicted
by
the
theory
for
that
matter
this
theory
of
yours
suggests
that
americans
should
want
to
help
the
serbs
after
all
theyre
christian
and
the
muslims
are
not
if
the
desire
to
intervene
in
bosnia
is
based
on
racism
against
people
that
are
less
like
us
why
does
everyone
want
to
help
the
side
that
is
less
like
us
especially
if
both
of
the
sides
are
equal
as
you
seem
to
think
on
the
first
day
after
christmas
my
truelove
served
to
me
leftover
turkey
on
the
second
day
after
christmas
my
truelove
served
to
