this
respect
israel
allows
freedom
of
religion
avi
for
your
information
islam
permits
freedom
of
religion
there
is
no
compulsion
in
religion
does
judaism
permit
freedom
of
religion
ie
are
nonjews
recognized
in
judaism
just
wondering
in
islam
there
is
no
compulsion
just
a
tax
on
dhimini
in
judaism
nonjews
are
allowed
to
do
as
they
wish
and
there
is
no
effort
made
to
convert
them
