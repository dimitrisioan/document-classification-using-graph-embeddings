lebanese
resistance
forces
detonated
a
bomb
under
an
israeli
occupation
patrol
in
lebanese
territory
two
days
ago
three
soldiers
were
killed
and
two
wounded
in
retaliation
israeli
and
israelibacked
forces
wounded
civilians
by
bombarding
several
lebanese
villages
ironically
the
israeli
government
justifies
its
occupation
in
lebanon
by
claiming
that
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
such
bombardments
of
israeli
villages
congratulations
to
the
brave
men
of
the
lebanese
resistance
with
every
israeli
son
that
you
place
in
the
grave
you
are
underlining
the
moral
bankruptcy
of
israels
occupation
and
drawing
attention
to
the
israeli
governments
policy
of
reckless
disregard
for
civilian
life

ahhh
of
course
israeli
morality
pales
in
the
face
of
charming
events
like
the
string
of
plorun
skyjackings
in
the
mid
s
remember
those
twa
jokes
and
not
to
forget
the
achille
lauro
and
however
many
airline
bombings
they
have
committed
not
to
mention
bombings
on
the
streets
of
israel
its
gotten
to
a
point
where
children
are
told
not
to
go
near
any
bags
or
containers
whose
origins
they
dont
know
because
they
could
be
bombs
or
last
weeks
katyusha
rocket
attack
on
northern
israel
by
fatah
those
wonderful
mainstream
moderates
with
whom
israel
is
attempting
to
negotiate
lets
not
forget
the
fact
that
more
palestinians
are
killed
by
palestinians
than
by
israelis
ahh
yes
those
charming
humanitarian
death
squads
ive
actually
seen
a
videotape
of
an
interrogation
dsee
the
documentary
deadly
currentsvery
neutral
and
balancedseriouslyit
was
rather
inquisitionesque
essentially
to
prove
his
loyalty
to
the
cause
of
whichever
group
it
was
that
was
interogating
him
he
had
to
turn
in
someone
else
or
else
face
death
in
one
of
the
many
funfilled
ways
that
the
death
squads
love
so
muchbeatings
dismemberment
acid
pouring
melted
plastic
on
the
face
of
the
guilty
party
and
of
course

always
my
favorite
did
you
catch
the
photos
in
the
washington
post
a
while
back
the
execution
of
a
collaborator
photos
one
palestinian
leading
another
at
gunpoint
the
collaborator
on
his
knees
the
gun
pointed
at
his
temple
the
executioner
standing
on
the
corpse
of
the
collaborator
shouting
about
how
this
is
what
happens
to
collaborators
wonderful
justice
system
and
lots
of
regard
for
human
rights
