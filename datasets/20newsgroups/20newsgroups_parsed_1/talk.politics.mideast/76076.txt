and
suggesting
the
creation
of
an
armenian
ss
formation
in
order
to
educate
the
youth
of
liberated
armenia
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
nazi
ideas
he
wanted
to
unite
the
armenians
of
the
already
occupied
territories
of
the

his
movement
and
with

conquer

played

a
minor
problem
was
that
some

were
not
aryans

subhumans

the
official

such
they
were
subject
to

racism

armenians
were
the

threatened

indeed
