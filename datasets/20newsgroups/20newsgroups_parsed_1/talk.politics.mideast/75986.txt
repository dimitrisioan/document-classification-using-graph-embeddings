what
about
cyprus
the
majority
of
the
population
is
christian
but
your
fellow
turkish
friends
did
and
still
doing
a
good
job
for
you
by
cleaning
the
area
from
christians
all
your
article
reflects
is
your
abundant
ignorance
the
people
of
turkiye
know
quite
well
that
greece
and
the
greek
cypriots
will
never
abandon
the
idea
of
hellenizing
cyprus
and
will
remain
eternally
hopeful
of
uniting
it
with
greece
someday
whatever
the
cost
to
the
parties
involved
the
history
speaks
for
itself
greece
was
the
sole
perpetrator
of
invasion
on
that
island
when
it
sent
its
troops
on
july
in
an
attempt
to
topple
the
legitimate
government
of
archibishop
makarios
following
the
greek
cypriot
attempt
to
annex
the
island
to
greece
with
the
aid
of
the
greek
army
turkiye
intervened
by
using
her
legal
right
given
by
two
international
agreements
turkiye
did
it
for
the
frequently
and
conveniently
forgotten
people
of
the
island
turkish
cypriots
for
those
turkish
cypriots
whose
grandparents
have
been
living
on
the
island
since
the
release
of
nikos
sampson
a
member
of
eoka
national
organization
of
cypriot
fighters
and
a
convicted
terrorist
shows
that
the
enosis
mentality
continues
to
survive
in
greece
one
should
not
forget
that
sampson
dedicated
his
life
to
annihilating
the
turks
in
cyprus
committed
murder
to
achieve
this
goal
and
tried
to
destroy
the
islands
independence
by
annexing
it
to
greece
of
course
the
greek
governments
will
have
to
bear
the
consequences
for
this
irresponsible
conduct

an
eye
witness
who

during

same
terrible
event
on
the
night
of
the
th
of

my
wife
feride
hasan
and
i
were
paying
a
visit
to
the
family
of
major
dr
nihat
ilhan
our
neighbours
mrs
ayshe
of
mora
her
daughter
ishin
and
mrs
ayshes
sister
novber
were
also
with
us
we
were
all
sitting
having
supper
all
of
a
sudden
bullets
from
the
pedieos
river
direction
started
to
riddle
the
house
sounding
like
heavy
rain
thinking
that
the
diningroom
where
we
were
sitting
was
dangerous
we
ran
to
the
bathroom
and
toilet
which
we
thought
would
be
safer
altogether
we
were
nine
persons
we
all
hid
in
the
bathroom
except
my
wife
who
took
refuge
in
the
toilet
we
waited
in
fear
mrs
ilhan
the
wife
of
major
doctor
was
standing
in
the
bath
with
her
three
children
murat
kutsi
and
hakan
in
her
arms
suddenly
with
a
great
noise
we
heard
the
front
door
open
greeks
had
come
in
and
were
combing
every
corner
of
the
house
with
their
machine
gun
bullets
during
these
moments
i
heard
voices
saying
in
greek
you
want
taksim
eh
and
then
bullets
started
flying
in
the
bathroom
mrs
ilhan
and
her
three
children
fell
into
the
bath
they
were
shot
at
this
moment
the
greeks
who
broke
into
the
bathroom
emptied
their
guns
on
us
again
i
heard
one
of
the
majors
children
moan
then
i
fainted
when
i
came
to
myself
or
hours
later
i
saw
mrs
ilhan
and
her
three
children
lying
dead
in
the
bath
i
and
the
rest
of
the
neighbours
in
the
bathroom
were
all
seriously
wounded
but
what
had
happened
to
my
wife
then
i
remembered
and
immediately
ran
to
the
toilet
where
in
the
doorway
i
saw
her
body
she
was
brutally
murdered
in
the
street
admist
the
sound
of
shots
i
heard
voices
crying
help
help
is
there
no
one
to
save
us
i
became
terrified
i
thought
that
if
the
greeks
came
again
and
found
that
i
was
not
dead
they
would
kill
me
so
i
ran
to
the
bedroom
and
hid
myself
under
the
doublebed
an
our
passed
by
in
the
distance
i
could
still
hear
shots
my
mouth
was
dry
so
i
came
out
from
under
the
bed
and
drank
some
water
then
i
put
some
sweets
in
my
pocket
and
went
back
to
the
bathroom
which
was
exactly
as
i
had
left
in
an
hour
ago
there
i
offered
sweets
to
mrs
ayshe
her
daughter
and
mrs
novber
who
were
all
wounded
we
waited
in
the
bathroom
until
oclock
in
the
morning
i
thought
morning
would
never
come
we
were
all
wounded
and
needed
to
be
taken
to
hospital
finally
as
we
could
walk
mrs
novber
and
i
went
out
into
the
street
hoping
to
find
help
and
walked
as
far
as
koshklu
chiftlik
there
we
met
some
people
who
took
us
to
hospital
where
we
were
operated
on
when
i
regained
my
consciousness
i
said
that
there
were
more
wounded
in
the
house
and
they
went
and
brought
mrs
ayshe
and
her
daughter

was
sent
by

then
released
me
on
foot

made
our
way
into
a
house
whose

broken
glass
a

bicycle
lay
in
a
corner
in
the

like
a
group
of
waxworks

three
children
piled
on

of
their
murdered
mother
in
a
room
next
to
it

the
home
of
