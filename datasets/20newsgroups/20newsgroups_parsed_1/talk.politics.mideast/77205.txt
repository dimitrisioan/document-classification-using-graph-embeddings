re
mosque
in
jewish
quarter
was
re
israeli
destruction
of
in
article
david
f
skoll
writes
when
i
was
in
jerusalem
a
couple
of
years
ago
our
guide
told
us
the
story
of
that
mosque
not
sure
if
it
was
true
apparently
it
was
built
by
a
jewish
convert
to
islam
he
had
had
a
dispute
with
his
neighbours
and
built
the
mosque
davka
to
annoy
them
its
a
cute
story
but
not
sure
if
its
true
if
he
gives
you
the
same
story
explaining
the
presence
of
several
synagogues
in
the
moslem
quarter
then
the
story
becomes
suspect
in
reality
the
old
city
was
not
as
neighborhooded
in
the
past
as
it
became
after
in
preisrael
jerusalem
there
were
many
jews
in
what
is
now
called
the
moslem
quarter
there
are
postal
and
telephone
directories
from
that
time
to
prove
it
its
really
rather
interesting
to
hear
arabs
there
claim
that
a
house
or
store
has
been
in
the
family
for
centuries
even
when
there
are
clear
photos
and
documents
that
show
a
jewishowned
business
at
the
same
location
just
a
few
decades
ago
