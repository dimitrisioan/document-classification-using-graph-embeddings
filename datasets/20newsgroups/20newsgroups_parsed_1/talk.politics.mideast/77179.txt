writes
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
remains
at
least
one
mosque
in
the
jewish
quarter
of
the
old
city
at
least
according
to
my
map
you
might
be
able
to
find
it
just
north
of
the
hurva
synagogue
is
this
mosque
really
still
there
was
this
mosque
built
by
squatters
too
when
i
was
in
jerusalem
a
couple
of
years
ago
our
guide
told
us
the
story
of
that
mosque
not
sure
if
it
was
true
apparently
it
was
built
by
a
jewish
convert
to
islam
he
had
had
a
dispute
with
his
neighbours
and
built
the
mosque
davka
to
annoy
them
its
a
cute
story
but
not
sure
if
its
true
