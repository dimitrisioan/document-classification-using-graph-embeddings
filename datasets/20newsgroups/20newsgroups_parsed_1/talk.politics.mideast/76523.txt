henrik
writes
the
armenians
in
nagarnokarabagh
are
simply
defending
their
rights
to
keep
their
homeland
and
it
is
the
azeris
that
are
invading
their
territorium
homeland
first
nagarnokarabagh
was
armenians
homeland
today
fizuli
lacin
and
several
villages
in
azerbadjan
are
their
homeland
cant
you
see
the
the
great
armenia
dream
in
this
with
facist
methods
like
killing
raping
and
bombing
villages
the
last
move
was
the
blast
of
a
truck
with
kurdish
refugees
trying
to
escape
the
from
lacin
a
city
that
was
given
to
the
kurds
by
the
armenians
however
i
hope
that
the
armenians
will
force
a
turkish
airplane
to
land
for
purposes
of
searching
for
arms
similar
to
the
one
that
happened
last
summer
turkey
searched
an
american
plane
carrying
humanitarian
aid
bound
to
armenia
dont
speak
about
things
you
dont
know
american
cargo
planes
were
heading
to
armenia
when
the
turkish
authorities
announced
that
they
were
going
to
search
these
cargo
planes
of
these
planes
returned
to
its
base
in
germany
of
these
planes
were
searched
in
turkey
the
content
of
of
the
other
planes
not
hard
to
guess
is
it
it
was
sure
not
humanitarian
aid
search
turkish
planes
you
dont
know
what
you
are
talking
about
turkeys
government
has
announced
that
its
giving
weapons
to
azerbadjan
since
armenia
started
to
attack
azerbadjan
it
self
not
the
karabag
province
so
why
search
a
plane
for
weapons
since
its
content
is
announced
to
be
weapons
