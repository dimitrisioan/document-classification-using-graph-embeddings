i
just
heard
it
on
the
radio
cknw
in
vancouver
bc
girls
are
fainting
in
masse
in
egypt
nobody
knows
why
but
the
movement
started
in
nothern
egypt
and
spread
throught
all
egypt
i
think
that
the
mossad
after
the
obvious
involvement
in
wtc
bombing
tries
to
reestablish
its
reputation
what
better
way
than
making
egyptian
schholgirls
go
bezerk
maybe
hassan
will
share
the
light
on
this
i
am
happy
to
annouce
tiis
second

danny

as
one
who
was
born
in
quebec
and
worked
in
montreal
i
feel
i
must
defend
the
reputation
of
mcgill
university
it
is
a
fine
old
creditable
institution
of
higher
learning
thus
i
can
only
assume
that
some
under
graduate
student
left
hisher
terminal
online
and
the
janitor
has
been
getting
access
to
it
