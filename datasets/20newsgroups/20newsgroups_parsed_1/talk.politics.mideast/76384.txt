start
paying
compensation
to
white
americans
who
suffered
from
being
slave
owners
do
you
have
a
problem
with
the
language
i
said
everyone
suffered
emotionally
because
they
sympathyzed
with
the
victims
of
holocaust
i
wasnt
implying
that
anyone
suffered
more
than
the
actual
victims
neither
was
i
implying
any
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
jews
as
the
cause
for
the
holocaust

is
wrong

you
guys
regardless
of
what
one
says

keep
hearing

to
hear
