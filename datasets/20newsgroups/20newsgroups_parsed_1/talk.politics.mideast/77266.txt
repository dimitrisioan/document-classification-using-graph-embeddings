writes
in
article
ram
vikash
tiwary
writes
now
that
all
the
parties
are
back
to
the
negotiating
table
the
stakes
as
i
see
is
are
indeed
high
and
the
future
stability
of
the
region
and
perhaps
the
world
is
in
the
balance
while
israel
continues
to
refuse
to
talk
to
the
plo
labelling
it
a
terrorist
organisation
the
window
of
opportunity
for
peace
is
narrowing
by
the
day
if
the
present
talks
are
allowed
to
deadlock
without
agreement
for
a
long
term
and
lasting
peace
that
taken
into
account
the
interest
of
all
involved
the
chances
of
peace
will
indeed
receed
the
plo
by
its
decision
to
rejoin
the
talks
has
staked
its
reputation
on
the
success
of
the
talks
the
longer
the
talks
continue
and
they
started
and
half
years
ago
without
any
tangible
progress
the
further
will
the
plo
support
in
the
territories
erode
if
a
land
for
peace
agreement
can
be
reached
and
real
soon
the
chances
of
a
comprehensive
peace
treaty
is
good
the
arabs
once
and
for
all
recognise
israels
right
to
exist
inside
secure
borders
and
isreal
would
in
turn
recognise
the
legitimate
right
of
the
palestinians
to
self
deternimation
and
statehood
with
peace
guarantee
by
air
tight
treaties
the
region
can
then
hope
to
dwell
on
the
economic
and
social
well
being
of
its
population
rather
than
prepare
for
the
next
war
ram
vikash
tiwary
as
we
see
right
now
the
position
of
influence
enjoyed
by
parties
favoring
the
negotiation
process
is
tenuous
at
best
the
local
elections
in
hebron
that
the
plo
was
expected
to
win
perhaps
adding
a
bit
to
its
flagging
position
of
legitimacy
in
the
eyes
of
palestinians
and
the
middle
east
have
been
disrupted
by
hamas
actions
overtly
directed
towards
undermining
those
and
all
west
bank
elections
the
present
ruling
israeli
labor
coalition
seems
to
be
one
rather
thin
political
ice
the
palestinian
delegation
has
been
reduced
from
to
three
to
protest
israel
lack
of
seriousness
in
the
talks
and
refusal
to
reverse
all
the
deportations
immediately
hopefully
however
each
of
the
parties
will
begin
to
learn
that
just
the
fact
that
negotiations
are
taking
place
does
not
mean
they
are
giving
anything
away
to
the
other
side
which
wasis
the
favorite
argument
of
the
rejectionists
lets
hope
that
discusion
and
inevitable
disagreement
on
major
issues
leads
at
the
same
time
to
some
agreement
on
smaller
interim
phase
whatever
term
we
prefer
steps
to
be
taken
