in
karabagh
specifically
in
stepanakert
an
uprising
had
taken
place
they
said

a
demonstration

started
several
armenians
living
in
the
zhdanov
district

look
after
me

knows
all
the
local
people
and
would
protect
me
if

the
whole
time

i
sense
some
disquiet
and
call
home
my
wife

tells
me
the
situation
is
very
tense

careful
we
finished
the
job
at
the
site
and
i
left
for
sumgait
first
thing
on
the
morning
of
the
th
when
we
left
the
guys
warned
me
they
told
me
that
i
shouldnt
tell
anyone
on
the
way
that
i
was
an
armenian
i
took
someone
elses
business
travel
documents
in
the
name
of
zardali
and
hid
my
own

hid
it
and
my
passport
in
my
socks
we
set
out
for
baku
our
guys
were
on
the
bus
they
sat
behind
and
i
sat
up
front
in
baku
they
had
come
to
me
and
said
that
they
had
to
collect
all
of
our
travel
documents
just
in
case
as
it
turns
out
they
knew
what
was
happening
in
sumgait
i
arrive
at
the
bus
station
and
there
they
tell
me
that
the
city
of
sumgait
is
closed
there
is
no
way
to
get
there
that
the
city
is
closed
off
and
the
buses
arent
running
buses
normally
leave
baku
for
sumgait
almost
every
two
minutes
and
suddenlyno
buses
well
we
tried
to
get
there
via
private
drivers
one
man
an
azerbaijani
said
lets
go
find
some
other
way
to
get
there
they
found
a
light
transport
vehicle
and
arranged
for
the
driver
to
take
us
to
sumgait
he
took
us
there
but
the
others
had
said
i
wouldnt
go
if
you
gave
me
a
thousand
rubles
why
because
theyre
burning
the
city
and
killing
the
armenians
there
isnt
an
armenian
left
well
i
got
hold
of
myself
so
i
could
still
stand
up
so
we
squared
it
away
the
four
of
us
got
in
the
car
and
we
set
off
for
sumgait
on
the
way
the
driver
says
in
fact
there
arent
any
armenians
left
they
burned
them
all
beat
them
all
and
stabbed
them
well
i
was
silent
the
whole
wayodd
milesi
was
silent
the
driver
asks
me
how
old
are
you
old
man
he
wants
to
know
if
im
being
that
quiet
not
saying
anything
maybe
it
means
im
an
armenian
how
old
are
you
he
asks
me
i
say
im
im
too
but
i
call
you
old
man
i
say
it
depends
on
god
each
persons
life
in
this
world
is
different
i
look
much
older
than
my
years
thats
why
he
called
me
old
man
well
after
that
he
was
silent
too
were
approaching
the
city
i
look
and
see
tanks
all
around
and
a
cordon
before
we
get
to
the
kavkaz
store
the
driver
starts
to
wave
his
hand
well
he
was
waving
his
hand
we
all
start
waving
our
hands
im
sitting
there
with
them
i
start
waving
my
hand
too
i
realized
that
this
was
a
sign
that
meant
there
were
no
armenians
with
us
i
look
at
the
citythere
is
a
crowd
of
people
walking
down
the
middle
of
the
street
you
know
and
theres
no
traffic
well
probably
i
was
scared
they
stopped
our
car
people
were
standing
on
the
sidewalks
they
have
armature
shafts
and
stones
and
they
stopped
us
along
the
way
the
driver
tells
us
how
they
know
whos
an
armenian
and
whos
not
the
armenians
usually
for
example
im
an
armenian
but
i
speak
their
language
very
well
well
armenians
usually
pronounce
the
azeri
word
for
nut
or
little
nut
as
pundukh
but
fundukh
is
actually
correct
the
pronunciations
are
different
anyone
who
says
pundukh
even
if
theyre
not
armenian
they
immediately
take
out
and
start
to
slash
another
one
says
there
was
a
car
there
with
five
people
inside
it
he
says
they
started
hitting
the
side
of
it
with
an
axe
and
lit
it
on
fire
and
they
didnt
let
the
people
out
he
says
they
wouldnt
let
them
get
out
of
the
car
i
only
saw
the
car
but
the
driver
says
that
he
saw
everything
well
he
often
drives
from
baku
to
sumgait
and
back
when
they
stop
us
we
all
get
out
of
the
car
i
look
and
theres
a
short
guy
his
eyes
are
gleaming
he
has
an
armature
shaft
in
one
hand
and
a
stone
in
the
other
and
asks
the
guys
what
nationality
they
are
one
by
one
were
azerbaijani
they
tell
him
no
armenians
here
he
did
come
up
to
me
when
we
were
pulling
our
things
out
and
says
maybe
youre
an
armenian
old
man
but
in
azerbaijani
i
say
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
and
he
left
turned
and
left
that
was
all
that
happened
what
was
i
to
do
i
had
to
the
city
was
on
fire
but
i
had
to
steal
my
children
out
of
my
own
home
they
stopped
us
at
the
entrance
to
mir
street
thats
where
the
kavkaz
store
and
three
large
story
buildings
are
thats
the
beginning
of
downtown
i
saw
that
burned
automobile
there
completely
burned
only
metal
remained
i
couldnt
figure
out
if
it
was
a
zhiguli
or
a
zaporozhets
later
i
was
told
it
was
a
zhiguli
and
the
people
in
there
were
completely
incinerated
nothing
remained
of
them
not
even
any
traces
that
driver
had
told
me
about
it
and
i
saw
the
car
myself
the
car
was
there
the
skeleton
a
metallic
carcass
about
to
yards
from
the
kavkaz
store
i
see
a
military
transport
an
armored
personnel
carrier
the
hatches
are
closed
and
people
are
throwing
armature
shafts
and
pieces
of
iron
at
it
the
crowd
is
and
i
hear
shots
not
automatic
fire
its
true
but
pistol
shots
several
shots
there
were
azerbaijanis
crowded
around
that
personnel
carrier
someone
in
the
crowd
was
shooting
apparently
they
either
wanted
to
kill
the
soldiers
or
get
a
machine
gun
or
something
at
that
point
there
was
only
one
armored
personnel
carrier
and
all
the
tanks
were
outside
the
city
cordoning
off
sumgait
i
walked
on
i
see
two
azerbaijanis
going
home
from
the
plant
i
can
tell
by
their
gait
that
theyre
not
bandits
theyre
just
people
walking
home
i
joined
them
so
in
case
something
happened
in
case
someone
came
up
to
us
and
asked
questions
either
of
us
would
be
in
a
position
to
answer
you
see
but
i
avoided
the
large
groups
because
im
a
local
and
might
be
quickly
recognized
i
tried
to
keep
at
a
distance
and
walked
where
there
were
fewer
people
well
so
i
walked
into
microdistrict
which
is
across
from
our
block
i
cant
get
into
our
block
but
i
walked
where
there
were
fewer
people
so
as
to
get
around
well
there
i
see
a
tall
guy
and
to
people
are
walking
behind
him
and
hes
shouting
into
a
megaphone
comrades
the
armenian
azerbaijani
war
has
begun
the
police
have
megaphones
like
that
so
theyre
talking
and
walking
around
the
second
microdistrict
i
see
that
theyre
coming
my
way
and
turn
off
behind
a
building
i
noticed
that
they
walked
around
the
outside
buildings
and
inside
the
microdistricts
there
were
about
or
people
standing
on
every
corner
and
at
the
middles
of
the
buildings
and
at
the
edges
what
they
were
doing
i
cant
say
because
i
couldnt
get
up
close
to
them
i
was
afraid
but
the
most
important
thing
was
to
get
away
from
there
to
get
home
and
at
least
find
out
if
my
children
were
alive
or
not
