they

saying
iran
had
to
show
proof
of
its
good

by
rescinding
measures
that
rocked
gulf
stability
and
security
the

avoided
the
antiiranian
rhetoric
of
recent
statements
by

which
engineered
a
last
minute
settlement
of
a
border
row
between
saudi

that

egypt
said
its
fears
about

intentions
in
the

and
tehrans
alleged
encouragement
of
moslem
fundamentalist
unrest
were
largely
behind

the

is

and

iran

it

since
rescinded

expelling
foreigners
who
worked
on
the

for
the

but

say
it
continues
to
exercise
its
authority
over
the
whole
island
which
the

sess
as
as

the

were
occupied
by

in

the
uae
has
since

crisis
erupted
insisted
that
they
have

the

called
on
the
un
to
maintain
sanctions
against
iraq
for
not
fully
implementing

council
resolutions
following

signed

egypt
and
syria
after
their

took
part
in
the
us
led
alliance
that
drove
iraqi
troops
out
of
kuwait
but
delegates
said
the
leaders
were
unable
to
agree
the
details
of
a
fund
they
announced
they
would
create
at
their
last
summit
in

last

economic
development
programme
they
said
the

could
not
agree
on
a
breakdown
of
contributions
from
each
state
although
the
total
amount
had
been
scaled
down
to
billion
from
the
billion
agreed
last
year
the
fact
that
the
leaders
of
all
gcc
states
saudi
arabia
bahrain
kuwait
oman
and
qatar
attended
the
summit
was
seen
as
a
major
achievement
although
their
unity
was
only
maintained
with
outside
help
most
delegations
were
not
too
worried
for
the
moment
about
the
slow
progress
of
the
conservative
rulers
discussions
on
a
future
security
structure
for
the
region
that
boasts
the
bulk
of
global
oil

gas
reserves
the

were
unable
to
choose
between
two
proposals
one
put
forward
by
a
summit
committee
headed
by
omans
sultan
qaboos
to
create

rapid

force
that

the
rule
of

people
in
bahrain
which
belonged

until

the

it

iranian

its
policy

its

disregarding
the
logical
potential
of
expanding
ties
with

played

said
ties
between
iran
and
iraq
which
fought

from

after

in
