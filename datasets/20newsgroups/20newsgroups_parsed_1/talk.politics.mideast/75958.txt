writes
any
concentrationlabor
camp
in
turkey
around
or
later
for
cypriot
greeks
or
any
greeks
rather
than
talking
nonsense
like
above
i
will
be
glad
to
read
what
they
got
how
can
you
be
in
a
position
to
know
about
any
kind
of
concentration
camps
akgun
living
through
those
days
at
the
age
of
and
following
the
internal
and
external
news
gives
me
that
knowledge
and
position
in
turkey
had
a
democratic
goverment
and
free
press
at
that
time
forget
about
internal
news
agencies
i
havent
heard
anything
from
any
international
source
about
any
concentration
camps
with
greek
cypriot
prisoners
in
turkey
however
i
heard
adana
pow
camp
it
was
not
secret
and
well
recognized
pow
camp
as
for
all
the
registered
prisoners
to
the
red
cross
having
returned
to
their
homes
this
is
your
version
of
the
story
there
are
cases
in
which
prisoners
who
were
registered
some
of
them
even
sent
messages
to
their
relatives
were
not
released
these
are
undeniable
facts
i
see
they
vanished
in
turkish
labor
camps
turks
have
decided
to
acknowledge
their
existence
first
but
later
changed
their
minds
releasing
them
is
that
it
what
do
you
think
happened
to
them
i
thought
that
mias
are
only
the
subject
of
rambo
and
chuck
noris
movies
seems
that
i
am
wrong
as
for
their
treatment
being
according
to
what
convention
okay
we
believe
you
you
dont
need
to
belive
me
turkiye
was
never
a
clandestine
state
in
its
history
it
has
been
a
respected
and
continuous
member
of
un
since
the
inception
of
un
no
body
ever
questioned
the
un
membership
of
turkey
because
of
what
had
happened
in
a
and
after
only
a
short
lived
arms
embargo
was
imposed
unilaterally
by
usa
to
satisfy
the
internal
greek
loby
i
know
what
you
would
say
next
let
me
answer
it
before
wasting
anytime
yes
un
had
a
few
condemning
resolutions
against
turkey
because
of
handling
the
cyprus
problem
especially
after
the
coup
well
us
and
israel
had
a
few
too
what
can
i
say
i
am
sure
during
athens
junta
duruing
greeks
had
their
own
share
too
closed
matter
today
between
turkish
cypriotsturksgreeksgreek
cypriots
there
is
no
more
any
official
demand
from
greek
cypriots
about
any
missing
greek
cypriots
where
have
you
heard
that
there
is
no
official
demand
regarding
the
missing
persons
have
you
looked
at
the
latest
un
agenda
for
cyprus
talks
mediated
by
gali
there
was
no
issue
whatsoever
about
any
missing
people
among
the
negotiating
parties
was
there
i
heard
many
times
from
denktas
interviews
by
turkish
and
international
press
he
keeps
saying
that
this
was
no
longer
an
issue
for
peace
talks
also
you
dont
want
me
fish
for
the
greek
cypriot
politicians
words
that
argic
had
posted
zillion
times
describing
missing
peoples
as
a
greekcypriot
myth
seems
that
there
is
a
different
opinions
among
greekcypriots
as
well
about
missing
people
in
turkish
custody
your
claim
that
the
majority
of
the
missing
persons
were
infact
killed
in
the
period
between
the
coup
deta
and
the
invasion
days
is
simply
not
true
all
the
cases
of
missing
persons
i
know
and
i
know
quite
a
few
are
cases
of
people
who
were
either
in
the
reserve
forces
and
were
lost
somewhere
in
the
battlefield
or
were
civilians
who
were
taken
prisoners
in
their
villages
by
the
turkish
army
i
am
not
claiming
anything
i
just
told
you
what
was
given
to
greek
cypriots
as
an
answer
by
turkish
govermentturkish
cypriots
when
they
wanted
to
locate
some
of
their
own
between
july
and
the
final
ceasefire
in
late
august
this
answer
seems
to
satisfy
the
international
community
the
un
and
the
vasilu
goverment
since
he
did
not
make
it
an
issue
for
the
peace
talks
also
i
am
not
aware
of
any
un
condemnation
against
turkey
about
any
missing
greekcypriot
are
you
btw
do
you
mean
that
nicos
sampson
had
a
bloodless
coup
deta
and
nobody
got
hurt
in
those
events
as
of
the
few
photos
which
you
refer
to
there
are
more
than
a
few
there
are
photos
not
only
of
greek
cypriot
soldiers
being
rounded
up
but
also
others
in
the
prison
camp
in
turkey
like
i
said
before
there
is
even
a
different
opinion
among
greekcypriots
for
this
myth
the
officers
in
turkish
army
who
governed
the
adana
pow
camp
must
be
hell
of
clever
dudes
to
cover
up
their
tracks
i
hope
turkish
army
doest
have
same
type
of
morons
for
the
security
of
turkiye
however
this
must
a
good
subject
for
a
movie
script
one
should
inform
oliver
stone
about
this
of
course
not
the
justice
was
served
well
if
and
when
the
bosnian
pleas
are
answered
whos
going
to
dare
to
ask
what
happens
to
those
masterminds
behind
the
ethnic
cleansing
idea
they
are
known
today
as
eokab
masterminds
were
known
in
to
everybody
and
are
doing
it
openly
even
giving
tv
interviews
it
may
take
same
time
as
it
was
for
the
eokab
case
however
the
justice
will
be
served
again
akgun
comparing
the
actions
of
the
serbians
in
bosnian
with
the
actions
of
turkey
in
cyprus
is
not
something
i
would
do
if
i
were
a
turk
i
thought
that
the
serbians
were
the
savages
the
inhumane
beasts
etc
etc
c
akgun
michalis
syrimis
if
this
is
what
you
understood
from
the
paragraph
above
you
better
let
your
computer
system
administrator
check
the
character
conversion
tables
in
your
system
if
yours
are
ok
i
should
inform
mine
c
