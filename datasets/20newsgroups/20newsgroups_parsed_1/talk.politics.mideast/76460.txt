solution
for
gaza
there
are
basically
three
alternatives
for
gaza
to
throw
the
jews
to
the
sea
that
is
basically
to
make
them
leave
the
middleeast
and
go
back
to
where
they
came
from
russia
europe
usa
etc
to
throw
the
gazans
into
the
sea
in
accordance
with
yitzhak
rabins
wish
and
that
of
many
zionists
for
israelis
and
palestinians
to
come
to
an
honorable
and
fair
i
dont
attempt
to
say
just
settlement
which
would
allow
each
person
to
live
in
dignity
in
his
country
in
freedom
and
equality
i
personnaly
opt
for
the
third
alternative
