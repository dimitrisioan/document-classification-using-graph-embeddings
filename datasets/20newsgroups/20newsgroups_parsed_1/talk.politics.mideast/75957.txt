subject
an
iranian
azeri
who
would
drop
an
atomic
bomb
on
armenia
in
article
farid
writes
farid
in
support
of
the
preservation
of
the
territorial
integrity
of
farid
azerbaijan
and
its
independence
from
russian
rule
the
iranians
which
farid
includes
millions
of
azerbaijanis
will
have
armenia
retreat
from
the
farid
territory
of
azerbaijan
oh
they
will
this
should
prove
quite
interesting
farid
to
count
on
iranian
help
to
supposedly
counter
turkish
influence
will
farid
be
a
fatal
error
on
the
part
of
armenia
as
long
as
armenia
in
farid
violation
of
international
law
has
azerbaijani
lands
in
occupation
armenia
is
not
counting
on
iranian
help
as
far
as
violations
of
international
laws
which
international
law
gives
azerbaijan
the
right
to
attack
and
depopulate
the
armenians
in
karabakh
farid
if
armenian
aggression
continues
in
the
territory
of
azerbaijan
not
farid
only
there
wont
be
any
aid
from
iran
to
armenia
but
also
steps
will
farid
be
taken
to
have
armenian
army
back
in
armenia
and
who
do
you
speak
for
rafsanjani
farid
the
azerbaijanis
of
iran
will
be
the
guarantors
of
this
policy
as
for
farid
scaring
iranians
or
turks
from
the
russian
power
experts
on
present
farid
and
future
military
potentials
of
these
people
would
not
put
much
farid
stock
on
the
russain
power
as
the
sole
power
in
the
region
for
long
well
farid
your
supposed
experts
are
not
expert
the
russians
have
had
nonstop
influence
in
the
caucasus
since
the
treaty
of
turkmanchay
in
hmm
that
makes
it
years
oh
i
see
the
azeris
from
iran
are
going
to
force
out
the
armenians
from
karabakh
that
will
be
a
real
good
trick
farid
iran
is
not
alian
to
developing
the
capability
to
produce
the
a
bomb
farid
and
a
reliable
delivery
system
refer
to
recent
news
releases
farid
regarding
the
potential
of
iran
so
the
azeris
from
iran
are
going
to
force
the
armenians
from
karabakh
by
forcing
the
iranian
government
to
drop
an
atomic
bomb
on
these
armenians
farid
the
moral
of
the
story
is
that
you
dont
go
invading
your
neighbors
farid
home
azerbaijan
and
flash
russias
guns
when
questioned
about
it
oh
but
its
just
fine
if
you
drop
an
atomic
bomb
on
your
neighbor
you
are
a
damn
fool
farid
farid
marshal
shapashnikov
may
have
to
eat
his
words
regarding
turkey
in
a
farid
few
short
years
so
you
are
going
to
drop
an
atomic
bomb
on
russia
as
well
farid
peaceful
resolution
of
the
armenianazerbaijani
conflict
is
the
only
farid
way
to
go
armenia
may
soon
find
the
fruits
of
aggression
very
bitter
farid
indeed
and
the
armenians
will
take
your
peaceful
dropping
of
an
atomic
bomb
as
an
example
of
iranian
azeri
benevolence
you
sir
are
a
poor
example
of
an
iranian
azeri
ha
and
to
think
i
had
a
nice
two
day
stay
in
tabriz
back
in
david
davidian

do
we

turkish
troops
on
sdpa
center
for
regional
studies

armenian
border
