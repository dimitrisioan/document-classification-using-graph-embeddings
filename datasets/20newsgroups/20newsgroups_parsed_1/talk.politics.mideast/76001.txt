maybe
im
a
bit
oldfashioned
but
have
you
heard
about
something
called
love
it
used
to
play
some
role
in
peoples
considerations
for
getting
married
of
course
i
know
some
people
who
married
fictitiously
in
order
to
get
a
green
card
but
making
a
common
child
for
the
power
of
aa
is
limited
your
proposal
is
indeed
unconventional
