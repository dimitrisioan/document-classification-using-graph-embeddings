your
posts
make
a
good
case
study
for
an
unashamed
misanthrope
instead
of
attempting
to
enlightening
pinkas
about
the
errors
of
his
ways
and
even
after
he
politely
asked
you
to
continue
the
debate
in
email
you
persist
in
publicly
lambasting
him
and
labeling
him
a
hypocryte
your
posts
not
mine
fit
this
description
what
was
the
very
first
thing
you
did
upon
entering
this
newsgroup
treat
everyone
who
didnt
agree
with
your
opinions
as
dirt
not
explain
to
them
why
call
them
very
rude
names
twist
words
for
flames
need
i
go
on
i
can
defend
myself
quite
well
against
pinkas
thank
you
there
is
nothing
you
need
to
defend
yourself
against
as
i
said
i
just
exchange
ideas
over
the
usenet
with
other
people
i
never
attacked
you
as
to
put
you
in
the
need
to
defend
yourself
against
me
i
am
not
a
violent
person
and
i
do
not
see
how
can
anyone
be
threatened
by
the
opinions
and
ideas
of
others
as
expressed
on
usenet
i
asked
you
to
continue
on
email
because
i
am
not
interested
on
a
flamefest
where
you
change
my
words
or
just
make
up
some
of
your
own
and
present
them
as
mine
so
do
not
worry
you
do
not
need
to
defend
yourself
because
i
am
not
attacking
you
next
time
you
try
making
such
comments
try
some
basic
civility
and
you
might
get
somewhere
this
is
a
good
advice
for
yourself
