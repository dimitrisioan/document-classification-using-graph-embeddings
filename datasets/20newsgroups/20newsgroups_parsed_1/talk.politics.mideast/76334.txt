the
gaza
strip
this
tiny
area
of
land
with
the
highest
population
density
in
the
world
has
been
cut
off
from
the
world
for
weeks
the
israeli
occupier
has
decided
to
punish
the
whole
population
of
gaza
some
people
by
denying
them
the
right
to
leave
the
strip
and
seek
work
in
israel
anyone
who
can
repeate
this
choice
piece
of
tripe
without
checking
hisher
sources
does
not
deserve
to
be
believed
the
gaza
strip
does
not
possess
the
highest
population
density
in
the
world
in
fact
it
isnt
even
close
just
one
example
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
folly
of
this
statement
the
city
of
hong
kong
has
nearly
ten
times
the
population
of
the
gaza
strip
in
a
roughly
comparable
land
area
the
centers
of
numerous
cities
also
possess
comparable
if
not
far
higher
population
densities

it

around

to

in

to

real
point
however
his
second
statement
is
quite
real
the
essential
sealing
off
of
gaza
residents
from
the
possibility
of
making
a
living
has
happened
certainly
the
israeli
had
a
legitimate
worry
behind
the
action
they
took
but
isnt
that
action
a
little
draconian
