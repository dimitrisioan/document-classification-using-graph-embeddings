those
who
wish
to
learn
something
about
the
perversion
of
judaism
should
consult
the
masterly
work
by
yehoshua
harkabi
who
was
many
years
the
head
of
israeli
intelligence
and
an
opponent
of
the
plo
his
latest
book
was
published
in
english
and
includes
a
very
detailed
analysis
of
judeonazism
you
mean
he
talks
about
those
jews
who
because
of
their
self
hatred
spend
all
their
time
attacking
judaism
jews
and
israel
using
the
most
despicable
of
antisemetic
stereotypes
i
dont
think
we
need
to
coin
a
term
like
jedeonazism
to
refer
to
those
jews
who
in
their
endless
desire
to
be
accepted
by
the
nazis
do
their
dirty
work
for
them
we
can
just
call
them
house
jews
fools
or
antisemites
from
jewish
families
i
think
house
jews
a
reference
to
a
person
of
jewish
ancestry
who
issues
statements
for
a
company
or
organization
that
condemn
judaism
is
perfectly
sufficeint
i
think
a
few
years
free
of
their
antisemetic
role
models
would
do
wonders
for
most
of
them

if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual
favors
we
sure
wouldnt
waste
them
on
members
of
congress
