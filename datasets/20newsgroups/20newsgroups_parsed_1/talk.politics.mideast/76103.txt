and
his
heart
i
dont

they

say
that
he
had
already
had
it
he
said
i
hit
him
twice
he
said
once
or
twice
on
the
head
with
that
rod
and
he
said
that
when
he
started
to
beat
him
shagen
was
sitting
on
the
ground
and
when
he
hit
him
he
fell
over
he
said
i
left
right
nearby
they
were
burning
things
or
something
in
an
apartment
killing
someone
he
says
and
i
came
back
to
look
is
that
shagen
alive
or
not
i
said
you
wanted
to
finish
him
right
and
if
he
was
still
alive
you
came
back
to
hit
him
again
he
went
back
and
looked
and
he
was
already
dead
after
that
that
bastard
tale
said
after
that
i
went
home
i
said
you
you
little
snake
i
said
are
you
a
thief
and
a
murderer
shagen
had
had
money
in
his
jacket
and
a
watch
on
his
wrist
they
were
taken
he
says
he
didnt
take
them
when
they
overturned
and
burned
the
car
that
tale
was
no
longer
there
it
was
other
people
who
did
that
who
it
was
who
turned
over
the
car
and
who
burned
it
that
hasnt
been
clarified
as
yet
i
told
the
investigator
how
can
you
have
the
trial
when
you
dont
know
who
burned
the
car
he
said
something
but
i
didnt
get
what
he
was
saying
but
i
said
you
still
havent
straightened
everything
out
i
think
thats
unjust
when
they
burned
the
car
he
was
lying
next
to
it
and
the
fire
spread
to
him
in
the
death
certificate
it
says
that
he
had
thirddegree
burns
over
percent
of
his
body
and
i
ask
again
why
was
he
killed
my
husband
was
a
carpenter
he
was
a
good
craftsman
he
knew
how
to
do
everything
he
even
fixed
his
own
car
with
his
own
hands
we
have
three
children
three
sons
only
igor
was
with
me
at
the
time
the
older
one
was
in
pyatigorsk
and
the
younger
one
is
serving
in
the
army
and
now
theyre
fatherless
i
couldnt
sit
all
the
way
through
it
when
the
procurator
read
up
to
years
deprivation
of
freedom
i
just
i
went
out
of
my
mind
i
didnt
know
what
to
do
with
myself
i
said
how
can
that
be
you
i
said
you
are
saying
that
it
was
intentional
murder
and
the
sentence
is
years
deprivation
of
freedom
i
screamed
i
had
my
mind
i
said
let
me
at
that
creep
with
my
bare
hands
ill
a
relative
restrained
me
and
there
were
all
those
military
people
there
i
lest
i
said
this
isnt
a
soviet
trial
this
is
unjust
thats
what
i
shouted
l
said
it
and
left
i
said
that
on
february
when
those
people
were
streaming
down
our
street
they
were
shouting
long
live
turkey
and
glory
to
turkey
and
during
the
trial
i
said
to
that
ismailov
what
does
that
mean
glory
to
turkey
i
still
dont
understand
what
turkey
has
to
do
with
this
we
live
in
the
soviet
union
that
turkey
told
you
to
or
is
going
to
help
you
kill
armenians
i
still
dont
understand
why
glory
to
turkey

that
question
