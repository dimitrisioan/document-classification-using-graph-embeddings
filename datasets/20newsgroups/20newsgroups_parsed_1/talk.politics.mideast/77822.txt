who
does

was
re

lovely
arguments
but
do
we
write
about
historical
ownership
of
any
place
palestine
pakistan
cyprus
aegean
islands
and
the
oil
that
may
lie
beneath
them
whatever
for
any
reason
other
than
justification
for
stomping
others
does
it
truly
matter
whose
ancestor
lived
where
or
years
ago
more
than
how
you
treat
the
land
and
each
other
who
is
wise
enough
to
decree
that
a
persons
right
to
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
in
a
particular
place
depends
on
accidents
of
birth
who
can
even
be
sure
about
the
precise
tracks
of
the
sperm
that
birthed
the
people
we
wish
to
despise
imho
the
american
indians
have
it
right
we
belong
to
the
earth
it
does
not
belong
to
us
failure
to
understand
that
is
a
good
way
to
cause
lossage
all
the
way
around
my
guess
is
that
once
we
trash
our
environment
sufficiently
we
shall
die
along
with
it
the
baby
eating
and
killing
its
mother
then
dying
for
lack
of
milk
death
and
disease
do
not
respect
national
boundaries
not
as
toxins
disease
vectors
lost
farmlandwetlandsforest
coverwater
supplies
nor
any
other
way
when
we
fight
over
which
national
group
owns
which
piece
of
turf
we
are
merely
contending
for
the
best
vantage
point
from
which
to
kill
others
our
land
and
eventually
ourselves
that
is
something
of
which
to
be
proud
very
proud
makes
me
glad
to
be
human
im
not
mindlessly
rejecting
all
nationalism
maybe
its
fair
to
ask
whether
a
recent
immigrant
deserves
a
share
of
the
infrastructure
that
all
my
ancestors
hah
labored
to
produce
but
its
an
artificial
distinction
is
the
recent
immigrant
even
a
refugee
less
likely
to
contribute
to
the
next
generations
legacy
than
anyone
else
in
history
the
reverse
is
often
the
case
recent
immigrants
strive
hardest
if
nothing
else
they
fill
open
ecolnogic
niches
then
again
my
tribe
is
infinitely
better
than
your
tribe
so
i
can
understand
you
all
have
nothing
but
plot
to
knock
me
off
while
i
of
course
will
make
sure
it
doesnt
happen
even
if
i
must
shoot
muslim
infants
or
bash
jewish
ones
against
the
walls
of
schoolhouses
to
do
so
thatll
prove
my
moral
superiority
by
golly
as
well
as
the
rightness
of
my
cause
clearly
there
is
no
higher
purpose
in
life
than
killing
others
because
they
are
not
like
you
i
would
never
get
in
the
way
of
such
fun
lets
see
soccultureturkish
why
dont
you
turks
go
back
to

where
you
came
from

leave

who
stole
