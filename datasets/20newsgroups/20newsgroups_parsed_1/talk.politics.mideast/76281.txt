i
think
the
israeli
press
might
be
a
tad
bit
biased
in
reporting
the
events
i
doubt
the
propaganda
machine
of
goering
reported
accurately
on
what
was
happening
in
germany
it
is
interesting
that
you
are
basing
the
truth
on
israeli
propaganda
since
one
is
also
unlikely
to
get
the
truth
from
either
arab
or
palestinian
news
outlets
where
do
we
go
to
understand
to
learn
is
one
form
of
propoganda
more
reliable
than
another
the
only
way
to
determine
that
is
to
try
and
get
beyond
the
writers
political
agenda
whether
it
is
on
or
against
our
side
tim
to
andi
i
have
to
disagree
with
you
about
the
value
of
israeli
news
sources
if
you
want
to
know
about
events
in
palestine
it
makes
more
sense
to
get
the
news
directly
from
the
source
every
news
source
is
inherently
biased
to
some
extent
and
for
various
reasons
both
intentional
and
otherwise
however
the
more
sources
relied
upon
the
easier
it
is
to
see
the
truth
and
to
discern
the
bias
go
read
or
listen
to
some
israeli
media
you
will
learn
more
news
and
more
opinion
about
israel
and
palestine
by
doing
so
then
you
can
form
your
own
opinions
and
hopefully
they
will
be
more
informed
even
if
your
views
dont
change
