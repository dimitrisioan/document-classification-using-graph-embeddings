the
depth
of
foolishness
the
turkish
historical
society
engages
in
while
covering
up
the
turkish
genocide
of

is
only
surpassed
by
the
ridiculous
historical
material
publicly
displayed
david
davidian
the
life
of
a
people
is
a

receiving
this

i
checked

what
i
have
found
was
totally
consistent
with
what
davidian
saidthe
book
was
like
voice
of
armenian
revolutionists
and
although
i
read
the
whole
book
i
could
not
find
the
original

there
was
one
more

how
when

by
the
way
how
is

am
sure
that
you
have
some
pretty
well
suited
theories
as
usual
and
i
am
ready
to
send
the
copies
of
the
necessary
pages

anybody
who
wants

are
you
claiming
that
there
cant
be
such
a

by
saying
it
is
not
possible
if
not
what
is
your
point
differences
in
the
number
of
pages
mine
was
published
in
serdar
argics
was
in
no
need
to
use
the
same
book
size
and
the
same
letter
charachter
in
both
publicationsetc
etc
does
it
give
you
an
idea
the
issue
was
not
the
number
of
pages
the
book
hasor
the
year
first
published
and
you
tried
to
hide
the
whole
point
the
point
is
that
both
books
have
the
exactly
the
same
quotes
about
how
moslems
are
killed
torturedetc
by
armeniansand
those
quotes
given
by
serdar
argic
exist
it
was
the
issue
wasntit
you
were
not
able
to
object
itdoes
it
bother
you
anyway
you
name
all
these
tortures
and
murders
by
armenians
as
a
crap
people
who
think
like
you
are
among
the
main
reasons
why
the
world
still
has
so
many
craps
in
the
any
question
hovig
heghinian
hmm
turks
sure
know
how
to
keep
track
of
deaths
but
they
seem
to
lose
count
around
million
well
apparently
we
have
another

the
butcher
to
contend
with
you
should
indeed
be
happy
to
know
that
you
rekindled
a
huge
discussion

distortions
propagated

several
of
your

if
you
feel
that
you

simply
act

crony
in

you
will
be
sadly
mistaken

duly
embarrassed
this
