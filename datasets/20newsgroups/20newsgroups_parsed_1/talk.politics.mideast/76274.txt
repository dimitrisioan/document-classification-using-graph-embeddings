i
said
the
fixation
on
bosnia
is
due
to
it
being
in
a
european
country
rather
than
the
third
world
i
recall
before
we
did
anything
for
somalia
apparent
leftwingers
saying
that
the
reason
everyone
was
more
willing
to
send
troops
to
bosnia
than
to
somalia
was
because
the
somalis
are
thirdworlders
who
americans
consider
unworthy
of
help
they
suddenly
shut
up
when
the
us
decided
to
send
troops
to
the
opposite
place
than
that
predicted
by
the
theory
i
am
a
staunch
republican
btw
the
irony
of
arguing
against
military
intervention
with
arguments
based
on
vietnam
has
not
escaped
me
i
was
opposed
to
us
intervention
in
somalia
for
the
same
reasons
although
clearly
it
was
not
nearly
as
risky
based
on
the
same
reasons
you
mean
you
were
opposed
to
us
intervention
in
somalia
because
since
somalia
is
a
european
country
instead
of
the
third
world
the
desire
to
help
somalia
is
racist
i
dont
think
this
same
reason
applies
to
somalia
at
all
the
whole
point
is
that
somalia
is
a
third
world
country
and
we
were
more
willing
to
send
troops
there
than
to
bosniaexactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
fixation
on
european
countries
theory
would
predict
similarly
the
desire
to
help
muslims
being
fought
by
christians
is
also
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
that
theory
predicts
for
that
matter
this
theory
of
yours
suggests
that
americans
should
want
to
help
the
serbs
after
all
theyre
christian
and
the
muslims
are
not
if
the
desire
to
intervene
in
bosnia
is
based
on
racism
against
people
that
are
less
like
us
why
does
everyone
want
to
help
the
side
that
is
less
like
us
especially
if
both
of
the
sides
are
equal
as
you
seem
to
think
well
one
thing
you
have
to
remember
is
the
press
likes
a
good
story
good
for
business
dont
you
know
and
btw
not
everyone
wants
to
help
the
side
that
is
less
like
us
im
referring
to
people
who
want
to
help
at
all
of
course
you
dont
see
people
sending
out
press
releases
help
bosnian
serbs
with
ethnic
cleansing
the
muslim
presence
in
the
balkans
should
be
eliminated
now
well
except
for
some
serbs
but
i
admit
that
the
desire
of
serbs
in
america
to
help
the
serbian
side
probably
is
because
those
are
people
more
like
them
