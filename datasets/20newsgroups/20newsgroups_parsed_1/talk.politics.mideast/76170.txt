re
turkish
government
agents
on
usenet
i
dont
know
anything
about
this
particular
case
but
other
governments
have
been
known
to
follow
events
on
the
usenet
for
example
after
tienanmien
square
in
beijing
the
chinese
government
began
monitoring
cyberspace
as
the
former
director
of
peacenet
i
am
aware
of
many
incidents
of
local
state
national
and
international
authorities
monitoring
usenet
and
other
conferences
such
as
those
on
the
institute
for
global
communications
but
whats
the
big
deal
you
shouldnt
advocate
illegal
acts
in
this
medium
in
any
case
if
you
are
concerned
about
being
monitored
you
should
use
encyrption
software
available
in
igcs
micro
conference
i
know
for
a
fact
that
human
rights
activists
in
the
balkanmideast
area
use
encryption
software
to
send
out
their
reports
to
international
organizations
such
message
can
be
decoded
however
by
large
computers
consuming
much
cpu
time
which
probably
the
turkish
government
doesnt
have
access
to
howard
frederick
university
of
california
irvine
department
of
politics
and
society
