what
gives
isreal
the
right
to
keep
jeruseleum
it
is
the
home
of
the
muslim
a
s
well

jewish
religion
among
others
what
gives
the
us
the
right
to
keep
new
york
it
is
the
home
of
the
united
nations
as
well
as
being
home
to
a
myriad
of
ethnic
groups
actually
nyc
is
more
comparable
to
the
gaza
strip
the
controlling
authority
would
probably
be
pleased
as
punch
to
unload
it
on
someone
else
but
noone
seems
to
want
it
heck
nobody
ever
mentions
what
yitzak
shamir
did
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
which
is
terrorize
westerners
much
in
the
way
abdul
nidal
does
today
seems
isrealis
are
nowhere
above
arabs
so
therefore
they
have
a
right
to
jerusaleum
as
much
as
isreal
does
ahistorical
bullshit
shamir
fought
the
british
who
incidentally
shipped
whole
shiploads
of
jews
back
to
the
nazis
for
extermination
and
hung
those
jewish
fighters
that
they
captured
and
didnt
want
to
deal
with
anymore
shamir
did
not
attack
civilians
on
airliners
cruise
ships
in
airports
sports
events
movie
theaters
markets
on
buses
and
children
in
schoolyards
your
comparison
to
a
master
murderer
like
abu
nidal
