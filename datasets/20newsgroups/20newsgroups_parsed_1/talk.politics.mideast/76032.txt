napoleon
writes
from
article
by
marek
osinski
well
it
did
not
take
long
to
see
how
consequent
some
greeks
are
in
requesting
that
thessaloniki
are
not
called
solun
by
bulgarian
netters
so
napoleon
why
do
you
write
about
konstantinople
and
not
istanbul
marek
osinski
thessaloniki
is
called
thessaloniki
by
its
inhabitants
for
the
last
years
the
city
was
never
called
solun
by
its
inhabitants
instabul
was
called
konstantinoupolis
from
ad
until
about
the
s
thats
about
years
there
many
people
alive
today
who
were
born
in
a
city
called
konstantinoupolis
how
many
people
do
you
know
that
were
born
in
a
city
called
solun
napoleon
are
you
one
of
those
people
who
were
born
when
istanbul
was
called
konstantinopolis
i
dont
think
so
if
those
people
use
it
because
they
are
used
to
do
so
then
i
understand
but
open
any
map
today
except
a
few
that
try
to
be
political
you
will
see
that
the
name
of
the
city
is
printed
as
istanbul
so
dont
try
to
give
any
arguments
to
using
konstantinopolis
except
to
cause
some
flames
to
make
some
political
statement
