what

the

similar

the

difference
is
that

my

probably
thought

help
you
genocide

to
get
the
point
besides
all
your

reflects
is
your
abundant
ignorance
ignorance
is
probably
the
main
reason
why
you
historical
revisionist
are
in
such
a
mess
you
even
make

armenians
laugh
in
soviet

today
there
no
longer
exists
a

soul
it
is
in
our
power
to
tear
away
the
veil
of
illusion
that
some
of
us
create
for
ourselves
it
certainly
is
possible
to
severe
the
artificial
lifesupport
system
of
an
imagined
ethnic
purity
that
some
of
us
falsely
trust
as
the

that
can
