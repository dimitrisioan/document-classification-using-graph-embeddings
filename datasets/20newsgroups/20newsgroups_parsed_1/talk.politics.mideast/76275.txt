your

is
obvious
from
your
posting
esin

cyprus
was
an
independent
country
with
turkishgreek
inhabitants
not
a
greek
island
like
your
ignorant
posting
claims
esin
terzioglu
the

should
be
cyprus
in
english
esin
terzioglu
next
time
read
and
learn
before
you
post
aside
from
spelling
why
is
that
you
turks
do
not
want
to
admit
your
past
mistakes
you
know
turkish
invasion
of
cyprus
was
a
mistake
and
too
bad
that
un
did
not
do
anything
about
it
you
may
ask
mistake
yes
i
would
say
why
is
that
the
greeks
did
not
invade
cyprus
the
greeks
did
try
to
invade
cyprus
just
before
the
turkish
intervention
they
failed
just
for
your
