well
panos
mr
tamamidis
the
way
you
put
it
it
is
only
the
turks
who
bear
the
responsibility
of
the
things
happening
today
that
is
hard
to
believe
for
somebody
trying
to
be
objective
when
it
comes
to
conflicts
like
our
countries
having
you
can
not
blame
one
side
only
there
always
are
bad
guys
on
both
sides
what
were
you
doing
on
anatolia
after
the
ww
anyway
do
you
think
it
was
your
right
to
be
there
ive
heard
many
turks
say
this
and
it
surpises
me
that
they
dont
read
about
itremember
the
treaty
of
sevresas
a
consequence
of
being
in
the
axis
powers
in
wwithe
turks
under
international
law
were
supposed
to
look
after
their
minorities
ie
greeksarmenianskurdsi
must
say
turkkurd
relations
are
improving
slightly
with
time
and
not
pose
a
threat
to
turkeys
neighbours
the
turks
blatantly
rejected
this
treatythe
germans
grudgingly
accepted
versailles
which
was
a
million
times
worse
for
the
health
and
pride
of
the
german
peoplethe
greeks
who
had
an
army
therewere
there
with
british
and
french
backing
to
enforce
sevres
in
possibly
the
first
example
of
appeasement
the
young
turk
government
managed
screwed
the
treaty
of
laussane
out
of
the
weak
alliesthis
was
after
the
greek
forces
were
were
destroyed
at
smyrnawhen
this
occurred
incidently
french
warships
were
in
the
harbour
and
many
greeks
trying
escape
swam
to
the
french
warships
and
climbed
aboard
only
to
get
their
arms
cut
off
by
the
french
as
they
clawed
theyre
way
up
the
sides
of
the
ships
libertaeegalitaefraternatae
there
were
a
couple
millions
of
greeks
living
in
asia
minor
until
someone
had
to
protect
them
if
not
us
who
i
am
not
saying
that
conflicts
started
with
that
it
is
only
not
one
side
being
the
aggressive
and
the
ither
always
suffering
it
is
sad
that
we
both
still
are
not
trying
to
compromise
i
remember
the
action
of
the
turkish
government
by
removing
the
visa
requirement
for
greeks
to
come
to
turkey
i
thought
it
was
a
positive
attempt
to
make
the
relations
better
compromise
on
what
the
invasion
of
cyprus
the
involment
of
turkey
in
greek
politics
the
refusal
of
turkey
to
accept
miles
of
territorial
waters
as
stated
by
international
law
the
properties
of
the
greeks
of
konstantinople
the
ownership
of
the
islands
in
the
greek
lakesorry
aegean
there
are
some
things
on
which
there
can
not
be
a
compromise
the
greeks
i
mentioned
who
wouldnt
talk
to
me
are
educated
people
they
have
never
met
me
but
they
know
i
am
bad
person
because
i
am
from
turkey
politics
is
not
my
business
and
it
is
not
the
business
of
most
of
the
turks
when
it
comes
to
individuals
why
the
hatred
any
person
who
supports
the
policies
of
the
turkish
goverment
directly
or
indirecly
is
a
bad
person
it
is
not
your
nationality
that
makes
you
bad
it
is
your
support
of
the
actions
of
your
goverment
that
make
you
bad
people
do
not
hate
you
because
of
who
you
are
but
because
of
what
you
are
you
are
a
supporter
of
the
policies
of
the
turkish
goverment
and
as
a
such
you
must
pay
the
price
so
that
makes
me
think
that
there
is
some
kind
of
brainwashing
going
on
in
greece
after
all
why
would
an
educated
person
treat
every
person
from
a
nation
the
same
way
can
you
tell
me
about
your
history
books
and
things
you
learn
about
greekturkish
encounters
during
your
schooling
take
it
easy
tankut
atan
achtung
baby
you
do
not
need
brainwashing
to
turn
people
against
the
turks
just
talk
to
greeks
arabs
slavs
kurds
and
all
other
people
who
had
the
luck
to
be
under
turkish
occupation
they
will
talk
to
you
about
murdersrapesdistruction
you
do
not
learn
about
turks
from
history
books
you
learn
about
them
from
people
who
experienced
first
hand
turkish
friendliness
napoleon
well
napoleon
it
is
your
kind
of
people
who
are
preventing
peace
on
the
world
first
of
all
you
didnt
answer
the
question
i
asked
at
the
end
of
my
posting
and
then
you
told
me
some
bullshit
throughout
your
posting
which
had
no
positive
point
about
the
issue
filled
with
hatred
and
filled
with
emotions
why
am
i
doing
this
forget
it
i
dont
think
you
are
worth
it
to
discuss
the
issue
