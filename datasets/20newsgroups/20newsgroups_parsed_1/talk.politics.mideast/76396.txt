eh
could
you
please
give
me
details
about
an
event
where
a
neutral
observer
was
killed
by
purpose
by
an
israeli
soldier
there
are
many
cases
but
i
do
not
remeber
names
the
isralis
shot
and
killed
a
un
observer
in
gaza
in
the
first
half
of
intifada
that
doesnt
answer
my
question
can
you
give
a
proof
that
it
is
an
official
policy
of
any
israeli
government
to
kill
neutral
observers
or
un
personel
or
others
like
them
i
wasnt
sure
that
your
original
statement
was
wrong
and
was
prepared
to
recieve
proofs
that
you
are
right
since
i
dont
follow
the
events
closely
your
last
response
made
me
pretty
damn
sure
that
at
least
you
cant
give
such
a
proof
and
you
made
your
original
statement
without
much
ground
to
put
it
on
i
believe
that
most
of
the
world
has
seen
pictures
of
israeli
soldiers
who
were
breaking
the
cameras
of
the
reporters
kicking
reporters
out
confiscating
cassettes
and
showing
reporters
militery
orders
preventing
them
from
going
to
hot
areas
to
pick
pictures
and
make
reports
even
if
its
true
and
in
this
case
id
take
it
without
asking
you
to
prove
it
it
is
still
far
from
killing
reporters
also
whenever
that
happened
ill
bet
it
happened
as
individual
actions
by
certain
soldiers
and
not
as
a
policy
of
the
government
eg
see
the
hawara
case
where
a
colonel
was
sentenced
for
giving
orders
to
kick
arabs
as
far
as
i
remember
bye
amos
shapira
jumper
extraordinaire
it
is
true
that
power
corrupts
cs
system
group
hebrew
university
but
absolute
power
is
better
jerusalem
israel
the
demon
to
his
son
