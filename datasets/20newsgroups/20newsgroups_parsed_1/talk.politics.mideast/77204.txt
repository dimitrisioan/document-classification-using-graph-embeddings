it
is
important
to
note
that
there
remains
at
least
one
mosque
in
the
jewish
quarter
of
the
old
city
at
least
according
to
my
map
you
might
be
able
to
find
it
just
north
of
the
hurva
synagogue
is
this
mosque
really
still
there
yes
it
is
i
have
taken
photos
of
its
minaret
was
this
mosque
built
by
squatters
too
dunno
one
should
compare
this
treatment
with
the
one
given
synagogues
in
the
jewish
quarter
in
when
it
fell
under
arab
dominion
of
the
synagogues
were
burned
down
by
mobs
and
the
other
were
razed
by
the
jordanian
army
i
think
that
in
comparison
the
israelis
have
done
an
excellent
but
certainly
not
perfect
job
at
maintaining
arab
mosques
this
doesnt
sound
like
eye
for
an
eye
anymore
