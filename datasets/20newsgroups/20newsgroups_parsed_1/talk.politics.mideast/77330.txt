why
is
it
then
that
when
the
british
iranians
and
uae
refer
to
occupied
territory
they
mean
territory
in
dispute
in
israel
but
not
in
their
own
affairs
i
suppose
for
the
same
reason
jews
call
the
occupied
territory
judea
and
sumaria
its
called
propaganda
actually
judea
and
samaria
are
proper
geographical
names
just
like
asia
minor
or
lake
michigan
judea
and
samaria
are
even
used
in
an
atlas
published
in
what
used
to
be
ussr
circa
that
i
have
at
home
the
government
of
the
ussr
was
of
course
quite
hostile
towards
israel
and
would
hardly
engage
in
a
proisrael
propaganda
i
would
be
willing
to
mail
a
photocopy
of
the
relevant
page
to
mr
schmidling
with
relevant
words
underlined
to
simplify
his
search
if
he
promises
to
report
to
the
net
afterwards
and
if
you
repeat
lies
often
enough
people
start
to
believe
it
mr
schmidling
is
to
be
congtatualted
for
being
living
exception
to
this
general
rule
for
although
he
is
almost
without
peer
in
both
the
number
of
lies
posted
and
in
the
number
of
times
he
repeats
them
he
hasnt
found
many
people
who
believe
his
lies
yet
