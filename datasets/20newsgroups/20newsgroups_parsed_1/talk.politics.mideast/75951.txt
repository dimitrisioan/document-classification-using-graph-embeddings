what
the
hell
do
you
know
about
israeli
policy
what
gives
you
the
fiat
to
look
into
the
minds
of
israeli
generals
has
this
policy
of
intimidation
been
published
somewhere
for
your
information
the
actions
taken
by
arabs
specifically
the
plo
were
not
uncommon
in
the
lebanon
campaign
of
my
brain
is
full
of
shit
at
least
i
dont
look
into
the
minds
of
others
and
make
israeli
policy
for
them
deleted
i
am
not
in
the
business
of
reading
minds
however
in
this
case
it
would
not
be
necessary
israelis
top
leaders
in
the
past
and
present
always
come
across
as
arrogant
with
their
tough
talks
trying
to
intimidate
the
arabs
how
would
you
deal
with
arabs
who
always
threaten
to
drive
you
into
the
sea
or
burn
half
your
conuntry
would
you
talk
nicely
would
you
say
please
you
wouldnt
the
language
of
the
middle
east
is
power
and
force
sorry
that
is
the
way
it
is
now
if
you
arent
strong
you
go
down
israel
has
to
talk
and
act
tough
notice
israel
talks
and
acts
tough
in
battle
but
is
willing
to
talk
peace
the
way
i
see
it
israelis
and
arabs
have
not
been
able
to
achieve
peace
after
almost
years
of
fighting
because
of
the
following
two
major
reasons
arab
governments
are
not
really
representative
of
their
people
currently
most
of
their
leaders
are
stupid
andor
not
independent
andor
dictators
true
and
they
have
brainwashed
their
people
into
thinking
jews
are
some
sort
of
monsters
arab
nonrecognition
of
israel
and
support
of
war
and
terror
is
also
an
important
factor
wouldnt
you
say
israeli
government
is
arrogant
and
none
comprising
what
do
you
want
israel
to
do
they
are
negotating
im
sick
of
people
calling
for
israel
to
withdraw
from
the
territories
now
thats
not
realistic
dont
you
realize
that
a
solution
must
be
negotiated
it
is
on
the
table
have
patience
ed
