so
why
not
condemn
the
mufti
for
his
nazi
leanings
and
while
also
condemning
the
similarly
genocidal
killing
of
innocents
muslim
or
not
in
bosnoiaherzegovina
hatred
and
bigotry
remain
just
that
no
matter
who
practices
them
indeed
yaqouv
just
like
the
ugly
hatred
spread
by
kahane
and
kahanists
right
or
they
are
exempt
from
condemnation
and
allowed
to
hate
no
fool
not
at
all
like
hatred
of
ones
sworn
enemies
enemies
who
have
said
time
and
again
that
they
mean
to
kill
you
and
have
by
mur
dering
innocent
men
women
and
children
shown
that
they
really
mean
it
the
late
rabbi
never
hated
anyone
merely
for
having
been
born
into
a
par
ticular
group
but
he
and
i
hate
and
wouldwill
kill
anyone
who
comes
to
kill
jews
i
recall
very
well
rabbi
kahanes
words
to
the
iraqis
at
a
demonstration
you
want
peace
here
is
our
hand
holding
out
an
open
hand
you
dont
want
peace
here
is
our
hand
holding
out
a
fist
i
know
youll
answer
me
indirectly
it
doesnt
bother
me
a
bit
keep
it
up
indirectly
the
wonder
of
it
is
that
i
bother
answering
the
likes
of
you
at
all
steel
whos
never
pissed
off
yaakov
k
on
the
internet
