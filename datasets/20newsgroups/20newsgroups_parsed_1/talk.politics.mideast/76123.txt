i
know
nothing
about
statistics
but
what
significance
does
the
relatively
small
population
growth
rate
have
where
the
sampling
period
is
so
small
at
the
end
of
this
is
not
small
a
per
cent
annual
population
growth
rate
implies
a
doubling
in
approx
years
can
you
imagine
that
most
people
seem
not
able
to
and
that
is
why
so
many
deny
that
this
problem
exists
for
me
most
especially
in
the
industrialised
countries
low
growth
rates
but
large
environmental
impact
irans
high
growth
rate
threatens
things
like
accelerated
desertification
due
to
intensive
agriculture
deforestation
and
water
table
drop
similar
to
what
is
going
on
in
california
this
years
rain
wont
save
you
in
stanford
this
is
probably
more
to
blame
than
the
current
governments
incompetence
for
dropping
living
standards
