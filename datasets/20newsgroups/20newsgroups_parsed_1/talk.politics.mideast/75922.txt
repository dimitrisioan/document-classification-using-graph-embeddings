tell
me
tim
what
are
these
guerillas
doing
wrong
assuming
that
they
are
using
civilians
for
cover
are
they
not
killing
soldiers
in
their
country
so
its
okay
to
use
civilians
for
cover
if
youre
attacking
soldiers
in
your
country
of
course
many
of
those
attacking
claim
that
they
arent
lebanese
so
its
not
their
country
got
it
i
think
hmm
this
is
confusing
could
you
perhaps
repeat
your
rules
explaining
exactly
when
it
is
permissible
to
use
civilians
as
shields
also
please
explain
under
what
conditions
it
is
permissible
for
soldiers
to
defend
themselves
also
please
explain
the
particular
rules
that
make
it
okay
for
terrorists
to
launch
missiles
from
lebanon
against
israeli
civilians
but
not
okay
for
the
israelis
to
try
to
defend
themselves
against
those
missiles
