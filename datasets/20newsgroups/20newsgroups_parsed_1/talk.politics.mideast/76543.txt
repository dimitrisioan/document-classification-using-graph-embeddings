there
is
a
difference
between
guerrilla
warfare
and
terrorism
the
former
primarily
targets
enemy
soldiers
the
latter
primarily
targets
civilians
and
not
necessarily
enemy
civilans
at
that
by
comparison
palestinean
fighters
primarily
target
tourists
schoolchildren
babies
worshippers
shoppers
moviegoers
and
other
such
threatening
people
early
zionist
fighters
did
no
such
things
this
is
historically
incorrect
early
zionist
fighters
did
indeed
target
civilians
they
made
random
attacks
in
arab
marketplaces
killing
innocent
passersby
your
assertion
of
the
opposite
is
an
attempt
to
whitewash
history
anyone
can
read
about
the
history
of
the
zionist
terrorists
a
good
book
to
start
is
the
one
