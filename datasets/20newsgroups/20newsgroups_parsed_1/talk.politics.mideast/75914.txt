press
hadashot
march
the
israeli
police
department
announced
on
the
evening
of
friday
march
that
it
is
calling
upon
jewish
israeli
citizens
with
gun
permits
to
carry
them
at
all
times
so
as
to
contribute
to
their
security
and
that
of
their
surroundings
considering
all
the
murders
of
innocent
israelis
at
the
hands
of
arab
death
merchants
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
the
advice
haaretz
march
yehoshua
matza
likud
chair
of
the
knesset
interior
committee
stated
that
he
intends
to
demand
that
the
police
department
make
it
clear
to
the
public
that
anyone
who
wounds
or
kills
nonjewish
terrorists
will
not
be
put
on
trial
as
usual
the
bias
of
the
center
for
policy
research
echoes
through
this
newsgroup
here
we
have
an
enraged
likudnik
who
is
venting
his
spleen
and
you
portray
it
as
if
this
is
going
to
become
policy
you
dont
say
what
the
response
to
matzas
suggestion
was
do
do
not
mention
whether
he
was
refering
to
terrorists
caught
in
the
act
which
could
be
a
clear
cut
case
of
selfdefence
would
you
care
to
elaborate
on
this
or
was
this
all
you
wanted
to
say
on
the
matter
why
dont
you
give
up
this
center
for
policy
research
crap
and
just
post
your
biases
without
trying
to
legitimize
them
with
a
pompous
name
haaretz
march
today
a
private
security
firm
and
units
from
the
idf
southern
command
will
begin
installation
of
four
magnetic
gates
in
the
gaza
strip
as
an
additional
stage
in
the
upgrading
of
security
measures
in
the
strip
the
gates
will
aid
in
the
searching
of
nonjewish
gaza
residents
as
they
leave
for
work
in
israel
they
can
be
used
to
reveal
the
presence
of
knives
axes
weapons
and
other
sharp
objects
in
addition
to
the
gates
which
will
be
operated
by
a
private
civilian
company
large
quantities
of
magneticcard
reading
devices
are
being
brought
to
the
inspection
points
to
facilitate
the
reading
of
the
magnetic
cards
these
nonjewish
workers
must
carry
a
laudable
precaution
every
single
thing
you
post
about
israel
is
posted
to
portray
israel
as
negatively
as
you
can
deliberate
omissions
are
an
integral
part
of
the
shtick
and
its
not
only
the
incidents
that
you
do
not
mention
but
even
the
stories
you
do
post
are
fraught
with
omissions
which
change
the
entire
meaning
the
absurdity
of
your
respectable
name
can
not
hide
your
bias
in
your
effort
to
portray
israel
in
an
unfavorable
light
you
have
accomplished
nothing
except
to
prove
that
a
respectable
sounding
label
like
the
center
for
policy
research
is
nothing
but
a
smoke
screen
for
someone
with
a
heavily
biased
attitude
against
israel
and
the
need
to
vent
it
you
this
center
for
policy
research
stuff
is
nonsense
