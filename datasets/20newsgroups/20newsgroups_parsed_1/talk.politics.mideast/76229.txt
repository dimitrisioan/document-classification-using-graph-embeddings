are
you
aware
that
there
is
an
arms
embargo
on
all
of
what
iswas
yugoslavia
including
bosnia
which
guarantees
massive
military
superiority
of
serbian
forces
and
does
not
allow
the
bosnians
to
try
to
defend
themselves
should
we
sell
weapons
to
all
sides
or
just
the
losing
one
then
ending
an
embargo
does
not
we
must
sell
anything
at
all
if
the
europeans
want
to
sell
weapons
to
one
or
both
sides
they
are
welcome
as
far
as
im
concerned
you
seem
to
oppose
ending
the
embargo
you
know
it
is
difficult
for
europeans
to
sell
weapons
when
there
is
an
embargo
in
place
i
do
not
automatically
accept
the
argument
that
bosnia
is
any
worse
than
other
recent
civil
wars
say
vietnam
for
instance
the
difference
is
it
is
happening
to
white
people
inside
europe
with
lots
of
tv
coverage
but
if
this
was
the
reason
and
if
furthermore
both
sides
are
equal
wouldnt
all
us
racist
americans
be
favoring
the
good
christians
serbs
instead
of
the
nonchristians
we
really
seem
to
favor
on

first
day
