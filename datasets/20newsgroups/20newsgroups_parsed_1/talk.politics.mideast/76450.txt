bull
shit
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
we
cant
say
that
taking
views
analogous
to
the
kkks
or
some
such
organization
is
wrong
there
is
no
reason
why
some
morality
may
not
be
legislated
as
it
is
we
do
not
allow
theft
or
murder
or
rape
why
should
we
allow
hateful
sppech
whose
only
purpose
is
to
stir
anger
and
violence
harry
actually
youre
wrong
as
well
the
kkk
is
allowed
to
march
and
any
attempts
to
curtail
their
freedom
is
rejected
actually
i
believe
the
aclu
won
a
case
for
them
last
year
morality
should
not
be
legilated
in
a
free
country
like
the
us
yes
that
seems
to
be
the
problem
even
germany
now
has
laws
for
its
military
where
soldiers
are
required
to
disobey
orders
if
they
believe
the
orders
are
morally
incorrect
naziism
is
prohibited
in
canada
germany
others
how
pray
tell
is
canda
any
less
free
than
the
us
ill
post
something
on
tj
and
uva
under
uva
for
those
hoos
bashers
