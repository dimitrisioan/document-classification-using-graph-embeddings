re
the
israeli
press
in
article

bdira

mark
ira
kaufman
writes
for
your
information
on
israel
since
i
read
both
american
media
and
israeli
media
i
can
say
with
absolute
certainty
that
anybody
who
reliesx
exclusively
on
the
american
press
for
knowledge
about
israel
does
not
have
a
true
picture
of
what
is
going
on
of
course
you
never
read
arab
media
i
read
arab
israeli
jer
post
and
this
network
is
more
than
enough
the
jerusalem
post
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
israeli
media
one
that
caters
to
outsiders
for
the
most
part
anyways
if
you
never
read
haaretz
maariv
or
other
hebrew
langauge
papers
or
at
least
seen
some
of
their
articles
translated
you
are
not
really
getting
the
israeli
media
and
western
american
french
and
british
reports
and
i
can
say
that
if
we
give
israel
and
arabs
on
the
bias
scale
of
course
you
can
switch
the
polarities
israeli
newspapers
will
get
either
a
or
american
leading
newspapers
and
tv
news
range
from
inlcuding
some
of
the
leftleaning
ones
to
yes
there
are
some
that
are
more
israelis
than
israelis
a
to
a
is
that
why
stations
such
as
pbs
have
run
shows
which
do
not
depict
the
israeli
standpoint
at
all
is
that
why
the
intifada
got
more
coverage
in
and
than
did
saddamn
gassing
kurds
by
the
thousands
the
montreal
suburban
a
local
free
newspaper
probably
is
closer
to
kahanes
views
than
some
israeli
right
wing
newspapers
british
i
am
from
montreal
i
read
the
suburban
did
they
ever
advocate
the
kahane
stupidity
of
expelling
the
arabs
are
they
racist
the
suburban
has
some
columnists
that
explain
the
israeli
standpoint
they
are
nothing
like
kahane
in
any
case
the
suburban
is
a
paper
with
a
minor
local
distribution
and
no
influence
range
from
neutral
to
french
that
iknow
of
of
course
range
from
afrofrench
magazines
to
arab
official
media
range
from
to
egyptian
to
in
sa
why
no
because
they
do
not
want
to
overdo
it
and
stir
people
against
israel
and
therefore
against
them
since
they
are
doing
nothing
as
to
the
claim
that
israeli
papers
are
biased
of
course
they
are
some
may
lean
to
the
right
or
the
left
just
like
the
media
here
in
america
but
they
still
report
events
about
which
people
here
know
nothing
i
choose
to
form
my
opinions
about
israel
and
the
mideast
based
on
more
knowledge
than
does
an
average
american
who
relies
exclusively
on
an
american
media
which
does
not
report
on
events
in
the
mideast
with
any
consistency
or
accuracy
the
average
bias
of
what
you
read
would
be
probably
around
while
that
of
the
average
american
would
be
the
same
if
they
do
not
read
or
read
the
newyork
times
and
similar
newsmakers
and
if
they
read
some
other
relatively
less
biased
newspapers
so
you
are
not
better
off
so
what
source
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
zero
