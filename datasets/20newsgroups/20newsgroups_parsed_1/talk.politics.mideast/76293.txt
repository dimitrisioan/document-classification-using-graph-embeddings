unconventional
peace
proposal
a
unconventional
proposal
for
peace
in
the
middleeast
by
elias
davidsson
having
stated
my
assumptions
i
will
now
state
my
proposal
a
fund
should
be
established
which
would
disburse
grants
for
each
child
born
to
a
couple
where
one
partner
is
israelijew
and
the
other
palestinianarab
the
emergence
of
a
considerable
number
of
mixed
marriages
in
israelpalestine
all
of
whom
would
have
relatives
on
both
sides
of
the
divide
would
make
the
conflict
lose
its
ethnical
and
unsoluble
core
and
strengthen
the
emergence
of
a
truly
civil
society
the
existence
of
a
strong
mixed
stock
of
people
would
also
help
the
integration
of
israeli
society
into
the
sounds
just
like
a
racial
theory
that
hitler
outlined
in
mein
kampf
someone
else
said
something
similar
i
will
not
comment
on
the
value
or
lack
of
value
of
eliass
proposal
i
just
want
to
say
that
it
is
very
distressing
that
at
least
two
people
here
are
profoundly
ignorant
of
nazi
racial
doctrine
they
were
not
like
eliass
idea
they
were
more
like
the
opposite
nazis
believed
in
racial
purity
not
racial
assimilation
an
instructive
example
is
the
nazi
attitude
to
gypsies
according
to
nazi
theoreticians
gypsies
were
an
aryan
race
they
were
persecuted
and
in
huge
numbers
murdered
because
most
european
gypies
were
considered
not
pure
gypsies
but
mongrels
formed
from
the
pure
gypsy
race
and
other
undesirable
races
this
was
the
key
difference
between
the
theoretical
approach
to
jews
and
gypsies
by
the
way
it
is
also
true
that
towards
the
end
of
wwii
even
the
purist
gypsies
were
hunted
down
as
the
theory
was
forgotten
