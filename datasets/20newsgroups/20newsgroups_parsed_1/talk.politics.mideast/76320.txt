recognize
the
statement
that
these
private
funds
were
all
tax
exmpt
in
the
donations
are
tax
deductible
like
any
donations
to
a
nonprofit
organization
ive
donated
money
to
a
group
restoring
streetcars
and
it
was
tax
deductible
why
dont
you
contribute
to
a
group
helping
the
homeless
if
you
so
concerned
i
do
did
contribute
to
the
arf
mortgage
fund
but
when
interest
rates
plumetted
i
just
paid
it
off
the
problem
is
i
couldnt
convince
congress
to
move
my
home
to
a
nicer
location
on
federal
land
btw
even
though
the
building
is
alleged
to
be
funded
by
tax
exempt
private
funds
the
maintainence
and
operating
costs
will
be
borne
by
taxpayers
forever
would
anyone
like
to
guess
how
much
that
will
come
to
and
tell
us
why
this
point
is
never
mentioned
