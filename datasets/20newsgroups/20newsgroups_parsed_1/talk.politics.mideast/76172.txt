most
of
the
people
in
my
village
are
regular
inhabitants
that
go
about
their
daily
business
some
work
in
the
fields
some
own
small
shops
others
are
older
men
that
go
to
the
coffe
shop
and
drink
coffee
is
that
so
hard
to
imagine
quickly
followed
by
some
young
men
usually
aged
between
to
years
are
members
of
the
lebanese
resistance
even
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
do
not
know
who
these
are
they
are
secretive
about
it
but
most
people
often
suspect
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
up
to
this
is
the
standard
method
for
claiming
noncombatant
status
even
for
the
commanders
of
combat
these
young
men
are
supported
financially
by
iran
most
of
the
time
they
sneak
arms
and
ammunitions
into
the
occupied
zone
where
they
set
up
booby
traps
for
israeli
patrols
every
time
an
israeli
soldier
is
killed
or
injured
by
these
traps
israel
retalliates
by
indiscriminately
bombing
villages
of
their
own
choosing
often
killing
only
innocent
civilians
innocent
civilians
like
the
ones
who
set
up
the
booby
traps
or
engaged
in
shootouts
with
soldiers
or
attack
them
with
grenades
or
axes
we
are
now
accustomed
to
israeli
tactics
and
we
figure
that
this
is
and
the
rest
of
the
world
is
getting
used
to
arab
tactics
of
claiming
innocence
for
even
the
most
guilty
of
the
vile
murderers
among
them
keep
it
up
long
enough
and
it
will
backfire
but
