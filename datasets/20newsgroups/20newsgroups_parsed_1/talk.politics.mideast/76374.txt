freedom
in
usa

this
is
actually
the
law
that
david
irving
will
hopefully
be
found
guilty
under
due
to
his
denial
of
the
holocaust
its
too
bad
that
this
useless
centre
for
policy
research
isnt
in
canada
itd
set
a
nice
precedent
to
how
the
law
applies
in
cyberspace
steve
internet
fidonet
my
opinions
are
not
associated
with
anything
including
my
head
well
canada
is
wrong
if
it
was
in
the
us
the
aclu
would
have
made
sure
that
such
repressive
laws
are
found
unconstitutional
do
you
think
the
church
didnt
find
galileos
perception
of
the
universe
offensive
