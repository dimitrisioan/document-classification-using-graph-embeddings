lebanese
resistance
forces
detonated
a
bomb
under
an
israeli
occupation
patrol
in
lebanese
territory
two
days
ago
three
soldiers
were
killed
and
two
wounded
in
retaliation
israeli
and
israelibacked
forces
wounded
civilians
by
bombarding
several
lebanese
villages
ironically
the
israeli
government
justifies
its
occupation
in
lebanon
by
claiming
that
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
such
bombardments
of
israeli
villages
congratulations
to
the
brave
men
of
the
lebanese
resistance
with
every
israeli
son
that
you
place
in
the
grave
you
are
underlining
the
moral
bankruptcy
of
israels
occupation
and
drawing
attention
to
the
israeli
governments
policy
of
reckless
disregard
for
civilian
life

im
sure
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
fbigov
on
the
internet
is
going
to
love
reading
your
incitement
to
murder
