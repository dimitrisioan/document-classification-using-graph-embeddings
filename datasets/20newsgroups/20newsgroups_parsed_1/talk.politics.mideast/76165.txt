your
view
of
this
entire
matter
is
far
too
serenely
onesided
and
selectively
naive
oooh
now
that
hurts
i
will
not
suffer
you
through
more
naive
and
onesided
views
of
mine
please
skip
my
articles
in
the
future
oh
wise
tim
and
have
a
good
day
basil
what
is
the
point
in
throwing
out
onesided
viewpoints
which
means
ignoring
that
the
other
sides
perspective
and
experience
has
any
legitimacy
while
assuming
that
your
side
possesses
no
faults
and
bears
no
responbility
for
any
of
the
negative
impacts
of
a
particular
event
isnt
the
former
onesided
isnt
the
latter
naive
if
you
feel
that
my
opinion
is
wrong
then
please
tell
me
how
strategic
withdrawal
under
the
cover
of
a
snide
remark
seems
to
be
the
favored
tactic
on
this
net
but
doesnt
accomplish
anything
