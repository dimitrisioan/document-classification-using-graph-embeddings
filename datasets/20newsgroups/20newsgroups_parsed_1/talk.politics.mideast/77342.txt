it
seems
that
to
keep
the
peace
talks
going
israel
has
to
keep
making
goodwill
gesture
after
goodwill
gesture
while
palestinian
arabs
continue
to
go
around
hunting
jews
you
know
that
putting
something
like
this
out
on
the
newsgroup
is
only
going
to
generate
flames
not
discussion
try
adding
some
substance
to
the
issue
of
gestures
you
mentioned
what
is
it
you
feel
that
israel
has
offered
as
a
gesture
what
would
you
realistically
expect
to
see
presented
by
the
arabspalestinians
in
the
way
of
gesture
timbo
israel
has
not
been
recognized
as
a
state
by
the
arabs
except
for
egypt
of
course
isnt
that
a
gesture
what
has
israel
offered
well
it
has
been
calling
for
peace
talks
for
years
asked
for
economic
relations
and
asked
for
diplomatic
ties
what
else
is
there
would
you
have
israel
sacrifice
its
security
nay
i
think
not
peace
pete
yea
i
think
not
also
israels
issue
is
security
so
any
outcomes
of
negotiation
certainly
need
to
address
isreals
perception
of
this
issue
the
problem
is
is
defining
by
outsiders
by
israel
and
by
the
arabs
themselves
what
is
the
issue
to
the
arab
side
is
it
palestinian
statehood
is
it
that
israel
as
a
state
should
not
and
must
not
be
allowed
to
exist
is
it
that
the
existence
of
a
selfgoverning
non
muslim
state
in
the
islamic
world
is
intolerablewhat
just
as
the
dividing
line
between
israelfightingforsecurity
and
israelfighting
toexpand
is
often
hard
to
discern
by
outsiders
especially
to
the
arab
world
so
the
rationale
behind
the
arabstruggletoundermineisraelin
anyway
could
either
be
based
on
visceral
rejectionism
or
a
sense
of
being
wronged
that
still
values
peace
who
knows
which
anyway
in
these
talks
what
gestures
would
you
think
would
be
seen
by
israel
as
substantial
