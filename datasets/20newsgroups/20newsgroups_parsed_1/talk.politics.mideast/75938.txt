the
documents

notes
by

are
among
the
best
evidence
that
exists
to
rebut
claims
that
the
holocaust
is
a
myth
archivists
say
the
notes
give
them
their
authenticity
said
robert
wolfe
a
supervisory
archivist
for
captured
german
records
he
was
supposed
to
destroy
them
like
a
lot
of
bosses
he
didnt
obey
his
own
rules
the
documents
moved
out
of
berlin
to
what
himmler
hoped
would
be
a
safe
hiding

himmler
spoke
on
oct
in
posen
poland
to
more
than
german
secret
police
generals
i
also
want
to
talk
to
you
quite
frankly
on
a
very
grave
matter
among
ourselves
it
should
be
mentioned
quite
frankly
and
yet
we
will
never
speak
of
it
publicly
i
mean
the
clearing
out
of
the
jew
the
extermination
of
the
jewish
race
this
is
a
page
of
glory
in
our
history
which
has
never
been
written
and
is
never
to
be
written

minerje
the
german
word
himmler

more
precise
translation
would
be
extirpation

tearing
up
by
the
roots

his
handwritten
notes
himmler
used
a
euphemism
judenevakuierung
or
