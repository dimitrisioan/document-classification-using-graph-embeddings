i
think
the
israeli
press
might
be
a
tad
bit
biased
in
reporting
the
events
i
doubt
the
propaganda
machine
of
goering
reported
accurately
on
what
was
happening
in
germany
it
is
interesting
that
you
are
basing
the
truth
on
israeli
propaganda
since
one
is
also
unlikely
to
get
the
truth
from
either
arab
or
palestinian
news
outlets
where
do
we
go
to
understand
to
learn
is
one
form
of
propoganda
more
reliable
than
another
there
are
many
neutral
human
rights
organizations
which
always
report
on
the
situation
in
the
ot
but
as
most
people
used
to
see
on
tv
the
israelis
do
not
allow
them
to
go
deep
there
in
the
ot
the
israelis
used
to
arrest
and
sometimes
to
kill
some
of
these
neutral
reporters
anas
of
course
the
yahud
needed
blood
for
the
matza
after
all
passover
was
last
month
why
dont
you
give
us
your
national
geographic
travelogue
of
your
recent
trip
to
palestine
or
are
you
too
disappointed
by
what
you
saw
josh
so
this
is
another
kind
of
terrorism
committed
by
the
jews
in
palestine
they
do
not
allow
fair
and
neutral
coverage
of
the
situation
in
palestine
to
determine
that
is
to
try
and
get
beyond
the
writers
political
agenda
whether
it
is
on
or
against
our
side
