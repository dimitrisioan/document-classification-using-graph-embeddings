subject
re
the
stage
is
being
set
in
article
writes
after
reading
plenty
of
categorical
remarks
claiming
the
arrival
of
the
restoration
of
colonialismo
could
anyone
define
colonialismo
indicate
what
colonial
countries
remain
indicate
what
changes
indicate
that
there
is
a
restoration
in
the
making
ill
leave
questions
and
to
be
answered
elsewhere
but
on
question
something
in
the
noos
today
might
be
an
example
of
the
restoration
might
be
namely
that
the
clinton
administration
is
considering
asking
the
un
to
establish
a
police
force
for
haiti
i
didnt
hear
any
thing
that
said
that
the
current
govt
of
haiti
asked
for
it
nor
is
there
any
real
precedent
barring
somalia
for
the
un
getting
involved
in
internal
conflicts
that
might
also
answer
question
the
neocolonial
countries
are
a
diffuse
lot
the
un
security
council
and
while
i
am
at
it
ill
take
a
stab
at
the
new
colonialism
as
defined
in
most
articles
i
have
read
would
entail
something
of
the
nature
of
trusteeship
under
the
un
sec
council
democracy
aid
education
freemarkets
free
press
and
then
out
for
the
colonialists
now
assured
that
there
is
a
civilized
country
that
they
have
left
behind
note
i
dont
support
this
idealized
concept
simply
because
i
think
it
is
a
lot
of
hogwash
srinivas
sunder
if
the
university
of
illinois
shares
these
views
id
be
surprised
they
arent
that
smart
generally
