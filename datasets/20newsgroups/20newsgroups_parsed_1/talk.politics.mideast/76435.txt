all
humans
suffered
emotionally
some
jews
and
many
others
suffered
physically
do
you
have
a
problem
with
the
language
i
said
everyone
suffered
emotionally
because
they
sympathyzed
with
the
victims
of
holocaust
i
wasnt
implying
that
anyone
suffered
more
than
the
actual
victims
quite
a
few
people
couldnt
have
cared
less
about
what
happened
to
the
jews
of
europe
if
they
had
cared
they
would
have
done
something
what
is
wrong
with
you
guys
regardless
of
what
one
says
you
keep
hearing
what
you
want
to
hear
maybe
its
because
many
of
us
who
have
been
on
usenet
for
several
years
remember
tripe
like
this
being
posted
for
all
those
interested
i
would
like
to
inform
all
that
binyamin
netanyahu
leader
of
the
israeli
likud
party
will
be
interviewed
on
cnn
tonight
on
larry
king
live
didnt
this
guy
go
crying
on
the
zionist
tv
confessing
that
he
committed
adultary
and
was
cheating
on
his
wife
a
typical
jew
leader
huh
this
was
posted
fairly
recently
there
has
been
much
more
racist
stuff
in
the
past
why
are
we
expected
to
listen
to
it
and
remain
calm
i
dont
think
that
listening
to
racist
or
antisemetic
slurs
is
an
incitement
to
calm
debate
perhaps
you
dont
mean
to
be
coming
off
as
highly
offensive
however
the
way
you
have
posted
seems
to
be
typical
of
those
who
have
an
irrational
dislike
for
israel
and
jews
perhaps
if
you
took
a
close
look
at
what
youve
posted
thought
a
bit
about
the
combatative
tone
youve
used
you
would
see
why
people
are
reacting
the
way
they
are
adam
shostack
if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual
favors
we
sure
wouldnt
waste
them
on
members
of
congress
