re
israel
an
apartheid
state
in
article
eric
s
perlman
writes
in
a
word
utter
and
complete
horse
puckey
look
the
term
up
in
the
dictionary
ok
lets
look
into
this
according
to
my
dictionary
zionism
an
international
movement
orig
for
the
establishment
of
a
jewish
national
or
religious
community
in
palestine
and
later
for
the
support
of
modern
israel
now
i
do
not
support
the
establishment
of
nations
based
on
religious
principles
while
i
support
the
establishment
of
nations
based
on
cultural
identities
so
here
are
some
questions
i
have
to
ask
for
anyone
to
answer
my
point
is
what
someone
said
long
time
ago
in
politics
like
with
men
it
is
important
to
distiguish
between
what
they
say
they
do
and
what
they
are
actually
doing
my
mother
is
jewish
and
so
is
my
father
if
i
apply
for
the
law
of
return
do
i
get
in
as
a
jew
trying
to
return
to
his
land
from
which
my
family
was
expelled
about
years
ago
if
i
go
back
which
nationality
would
my
id
show
if
i
decided
to
go
back
to
the
land
from
which
my
relatives
had
been
expelled
years
ago
but
first
i
convert
to
any
other
religion
can
i
apply
to
the
law
of
return
as
a
member
of
the
jewish
nation
or
should
i
apply
as
someone
whose
mother
is
jewish
which
nationality
would
show
my
id
in
case
what
has
change
in
me
between
the
day
before
and
the
day
after
i
converted
to
loose
my
being
part
of
the
jewish
nation
suppose
i
want
to
get
married
to
my
current
wife
who
is
nonjewish
in
israel
how
do
i
do
it
how
would
my
situation
change
if
i
decided
after
going
back
to
israel
to
convert
to
islam
now
here
is
one
more
question
i
do
believe
that
most
people
in
a
country
do
not
care
about
politics
they
just
want
to
be
left
alone
suppose
my
father
is
arab
suppose
he
was
born
in
palestine
in
some
place
which
now
is
part
of
israel
suppose
that
his
father
and
his
grandfather
as
well
as
or
generations
before
him
were
born
in
that
place
now
suppose
there
is
a
war
of
independence
and
my
father
scared
by
all
the
fighting
going
on
tries
to
take
his
family
to
a
place
more
secure
among
people
he
knows
who
speak
a
language
he
understands
who
worship
the
same
god
now
suppose
that
that
place
is
some
other
arab
country
and
now
suppose
that
the
war
is
over
and
that
there
is
a
new
country
created
where
my
father
used
to
live
and
that
that
country
is
called
israel
and
that
in
that
country
jews
from
all
over
the
world
are
received
and
that
people
whose
family
left
thet
country
generation
ago
are
recieved
and
granted
fullcitizenship
should
i
if
i
decided
to
go
back
to
my
fathers
land
where
he
was
born
as
or
generations
of
my
family
were
born
have
the
right
to
go
back
and
ask
to
be
recognized
in
the
same
way
those
who
are
returning
after
years
then
finally
people
ask
me
how
i
would
define
a
jew
but
that
is
irrelevant
i
am
not
talking
about
how
i
would
define
a
jew
but
about
how
people
in
zionist
organizations
and
more
important
in
israel
define
a
jew
how
would
those
who
are
zionist
define
a
jew
