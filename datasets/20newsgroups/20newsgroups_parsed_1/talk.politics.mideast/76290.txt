there
are
many
neutral
human
rights
organizations
which
always
report
on
the
situation
in
the
ot
but
as
most
people
used
to
see
on
tv
the
israelis
do
not
allow
them
to
go
deep
there
in
the
ot
the
israelis
used
to
arrest
and
sometimes
to
kill
some
of
these
neutral
reporters
so
this
is
another
kind
of
terrorism
committed
by
the
jews
in
palestine
they
do
not
allow
fair
and
neutral
coverage
of
the
situation
in
palestine
please
list
the
names
of
some
of
those
neutral
reporters
that
were
killed
in
the
ot
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
outbreak
of
the
intifada
palestinian
parties
quickly
began
orchestrating
their
demonstrations
for
the
benefit
of
the
media
having
spoken
to
a
danish
reporter
who
covered
the
initfada
i
know
of
at
least
one
case
where
he
found
out
that
a
mass
demonstration
on
the
outskirts
of
gaza
was
setup
for
himself
and
his
colleagues
when
i
asked
whether
the
footage
shot
was
sent
he
replied
affirmatively
after
all
it
did
happen
when
this
became
the
case
the
idf
began
closing
sensitive
trouble
spots
to
reporters
