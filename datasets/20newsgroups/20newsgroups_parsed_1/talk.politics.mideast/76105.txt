if
indeed
israeli
soldiers
killed
a
hamas
mujahid
with
an
antitank
missile
then
im
almost
sure
that
the
terrorist
zionists
would
not
have
been
able
to
cut
up
a
body
which
was
probably
desintegrated
by
the
missile
maybe
the
missile
didnt
hit
directly
such
that
his
body
gets
desintegrated
of
course
destroying
houses
to
kill
someone
is
not
a
surgical
operation
or
is
it
h
a
