you
know
when
israelis
f
thanks
to
general
dynamics
fly
high
in
the
sky
and
bomb
the
hell
out
of
some
village
in
lebanon
where
civilians
including
babies
and
eldery
getting
killed
is
that
plain
murder
or
what
if
you
arabs
wouldnt
position
guerilla
bases
in
refugee
camps
artillery
batteries
atop
apartment
buildings
and
munitions
dumps
in
hospitals
maybe
civilians
wouldnt
get
killed
kinda
like
saddam
hussein
putting
civilians
in
a
military
bunker
ed
who
is
the
you
arabs
here
since
you
are
replying
to
my
article
you
are
assuming
that
i
am
an
arab
well
im
not
an
arab
but
i
think
you
are
brain
is
full
of
shit
if
you
really
believe
what
you
said
the
bombardment
of
civilian
and
none
civilian
areas
in
lebanon
by
israel
is
very
consistent
with
its
policy
of
intimidation
that
is
the
only
policy
that
has
been
practiced
by
the
so
called
only
democracy
in
the
middle
east
what
the
hell
do
you
know
about
israeli
policy
what
gives
you
the
fiat
to
look
into
the
minds
of
israeli
generals
has
this
policy
of
intimidation
been
published
somewhere
for
your
information
the
actions
taken
by
arabs
specifically
the
plo
were
not
uncommon
in
the
lebanon
campaign
of
my
brain
is
full
of
shit
at
least
i
dont
look
into
the
minds
of
others
and
make
israeli
policy
for
them
i
was
merley
pointing
out
that
the
other
side
is
also
suffering
like
i
said
im
not
an
arab
but
if
i
was
say
a
lebanese
you
bet
i
would
defende
my
homeland
against
any
invader
by
any
means
yeah
yeah
yeah
we
all
suffer
its
too
bad
that
civilians
get
killed
but
i
will
blame
their
arab
leaders
who
put
them
in
positions
of
danger
before
i
will
blame
the
israelis
just
like
palestinians
who
send
their
children
into
warzones
to
throw
rocks
at
armed
israeli
soldiers
what
irresponsible
parents
as
golda
meir
said
peace
will
only
come
when
the
arabs
start
loving
their
children
more
than
they
hate
the
jews
