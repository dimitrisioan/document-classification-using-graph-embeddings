palestinian
gunmen
sunday
shot
and
killed
two
israelis
who
entered
gaza
to
buy
cheap
produce
and
two
arabs
who
were
assisting
them
elsewhere
in
the
crowded
strip
israeli
troops
killed
a
monthold
infant
and
a
yearold
boy
during
rockthrowing
clashes
at
two
refugee
camps
can
anybody
guess
this
from
the
title
can
anyone
figure
out
what
kind
of
deranged
parent
was
stupid
enough
to
bring
their
infant
on
a
rock
throwing
crusade
or
jihad
sorry
month
old
infants
certainly
dont
walk
around
the
streets
on
their
own
that
would
lead
me
to
believe
that
some
nimrod
of
a
parent
brought
them
along
for
a
little
terrorism
not
me
i
thought
that
a
clash
between
israelis
and
arabs
resulted
in
four
deaths
on
one
side
and
two
on
the
other
thats
what
happened
the
driveby
shooting
outside
the
jewish
settlement
of
gadid
in
southern
gaza
prompted
prime
minister
yitzhak
rabin
to
warn
israelis
they
were
endangering
their
lives
by
doing
illegal
business
in
the
occupied
territories
how
about
being
illegally
settled
there
i
am
not
sure
about
the
signals
the
israelis
are
sending
one
day
they
are
willing
to
accept
a
jordanwest
bank
federation
the
other
they
do
not
recognize
the
west
bank
as
occupied
territory
neither
did
the
us
the
honest
brocker
details
of
the
killings
omitted
plohamas
graffiti
both
claim
responsability
uhm
last
i
heard
the
territories
were
disputed
israels
occupation
is
not
illegal
they
are
legally
allowed
to
remain
there
until
a
settlement
is
reached
with
the
arabs
which
from
the
behavior
of
the
palestinian
negotitating
team
will
probably
be
never
the
israelis
had
entered
gaza
in
a
car
driven
by
the
man
from
hebron
now
dont
tell
me
that
this
could
not
be
an
israeli
spy
we
will
know
later
huh
they
were
buying
vegetables
which
carried
the
easily
identified
blue
license
plates
of
arab
vehicles
in
the
west
bank
when
israelis
enter
gaza
with
their
own
cars
which
carry
yellow
plates
they
are
usually
stoned
and
burned
by
angry
palestinian
residents
now
the
upi
shows
its
ugly
face
once
and
for
all
usually
it
happened
once
this
year
once
last
year
out
of
possibly
thousands
or
more
man
how
low
can
you
get
for
those
of
you
bigoted
enough
not
to
see
what
is
transmitted
here
i
will
tell
you
something
that
is
at
least
as
close
to
the
truth
as
the
above
babieschildren
who
venture
outside
their
homes
are
usually
shot
and
killed
by
the
israeli
soldiers
army
officials
said
the
joint
operation
by
members
of
the
plotied
fatah
hawks
and
the
hamasconnected
kassem
brigade
arose
from
their
anger
at
the
armys
killing
of
six
fugitives
from
each
group
over
the
past
month
the
groups
sprayed
graffiti
on
walls
in
khan
yunis
calling
the
attack
an
act
of
revenge
for
the
killing
of
their
comrades
