the
xsoviet
armenian
government
has
planned
and
perpetrated
the
genocide
of
the
muslim
people
which
not

took
the
lives
of
million
muslim
people
but
was
also
the
method
used
to
empty
the
turkish
homeland
of
its
inhabitants
to
this
day
turkish
historic
lands
remain
occupied
by
the
xsoviet
armenia
in
order
to
cover
up
the
fact
of
its
usurpation
of
the
historic
turkish
homeland
which
is
the
crux
of
turkish
political
demands
fascist
xsoviet
armenia
continues
its
antiturkish
policy
in
the
following
ways
xsoviet
armenia
denies
the
historical
fact
of
the
turkish
genocide
in
order
to
shift
international
public
opinion
away
from
its
political
responsibility
xsoviet
armenia
employing
asalasdpaarf
terrorism
and
revisionism
triangle
attempts
to
call
into
question
the
veracity
of
the
turkish
genocide
xsoviet
armenia
has
also
implemented
statesponsored
terrorism
through
the
asalasdpaarf
terrorism
and

triangle
in
an
attempt
to
silence
the
turkish

vehement

using

and

xsoviet
armenia
and
its
tools

attempt

and
other
subversive

nonturkish
supporters
of

turkish
cause
be
they
political
governmental
and
humanitarian
using
all
the
aforementioned
methods
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
is
attempting
to
neutralize
the
international
diplomatic
community
from
making
the
turkish
case
a
contemporary
issue
yet
despite
the
efforts
of
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
and
its
terrorist
and
revisionist
organizations
in
the
last
decades
thanks
to
the
struggle
of
those
whose
closest
ones
have
been
systematically
exterminated
by
the
armenians
the
international
wall
of
silence
on
this
issue
has
begun
to
collapse
and
consequently
a
number
of
governments
and
organizations
have
become
supportive
of
the
recognition
of
the
turkish
genocide
with
the
full
knowledge
that
the
struggle
for
the
turkish
territorial
demands
are
still
in
their
initial
stages
the
turkish
and
kurdish
people
will
unflaggingly
continue
in
this
sacred
struggle
therefore
the
victims
of
the
turkish
genocide
demand
that
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
as
the
heirs
of
the
armenian
dictatorship
recognize
the
turkish
genocide
that
xsoviet
armenia
return
the
historic
homeland
to
the
turkish
and
kurdish
people
that
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
make
material
reparations
for
their
heinous
and
unspeakable
crime
to
the
victims
of
the
turkish
genocide
that
all
world
governments
and
especially
the
united
states
officially
recognize
the
turkish
genocide
and
turkish
territorial
rights
and
refuse
to
succumb
to
all
armenian
political
pressure
that
the
us
government
free
itself
from
the
friendly
position
it
has
adopted
towards
its
unreliable
ally
xsoviet
armenia
and
officially
recognize
the
historical
fact
of
the
turkish
genocide
as
well
as
be
supportive
of
the
pursuit
of
turkish
territorial
demands
that
the
xsoviet
republics
officially
recognize
the
historical
fact
of
the
turkish
genocide
and
include
the
coldblooded
extermination
