can
someone
elaborate
a
little
on
what
this
libertarian
movement
is
i
am
not
going
to
draw
conclusions
from
a
small
sample
but
so
far
i
recall
two
selfdescribed
libertarians
posting
here
both
seems
to
be
incredibly
ignorant
incredibly
arrogant
all
they
want
is
to
get
people
angry
posses
a
lousy
sense
of
humor
write
incoherently
and
jump
from
topic
to
topic
without
any
logical
connection
between
topics
describe
themselves
as
intelligent
and
knowledgeable
although
everything
in
their
posters
points
to
the
opposite
very
childish
is
this
some
campaign
to
smear
this
libertarian
party
or
what
wow
hang
on
a
second
the
libertarian
party
stands
for
personal
freedom
lassezfaire
economics
and
minimal
government
whoever
is
describing
the
self
as
a
libertarian
maybe
you
were
refering
to
the
posters
who
call
themselves
civil
libertarians
are
not
talking
at
all
about
libertarian
philosophy
