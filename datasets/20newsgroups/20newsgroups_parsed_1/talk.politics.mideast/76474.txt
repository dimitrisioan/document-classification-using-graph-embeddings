the
un
has
tried
many
times
to
condemn
israel
for
its
gross
violation
of
human
rights
the
un
has
also
failed
to
condemn
gross
violations
of
human
rights
in
many
other
places
around
the
globe
and
in
the
middle
east
thus
leading
many
people
to
conclude
that
the
un
is
biased

whom

chooses

wow
if
you
were
the
only
source
of
news
around
the
world
it
would
seem
that
israel
is
being
treated
unfairly
ok
you
dont
like
what
i
have
to
say
would
you
care
to
demonstrate
how
the
above
list
or
any
expanded
version
of
it
you
chose
to
post
demonstrates
fairness
in
the
actions
of
the
un
wrt
israel
luckily
that
is
not
the
case
i
suggest
reading
european
papers
rather
than
israeli
propaganda
arab
papers
wouldnt
hurt
either
to
see
the
propaganda
of
the
other
side
you
make
the
odd
assumption
that
i
read
israeli
papers
not
european
ones
my
main
source
of
news
is
the
economist
a
london
based
magazine
also
i
do
on
rare
occaisons
read
arab
papers
but
its
hard
to
find
english
language
papers
from
arab
countries
here
anyway
you
are
an
example
of
what
happens
when
people
chose
what
to
read
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
perfectly
within
your
rights
just
dont
go
off
acting
like
youre
objective
have
i
ever
claimed
to
be
objective
i
pointed
out
with
a
item
list
that
israel
is
condemned
for
actions
that
other
nations
are
not
condemned
for
you
go
off
and
attack
me
for
reading
only
israeli
newspapers
if
youd
like
to
debate
this
please
do
if
youd
like
to
make
ad
hominum
attacks
feel
free
to
do
that
too
but
try
not
to
mask
one
as
another

if
we
had
a
