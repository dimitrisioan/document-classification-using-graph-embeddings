re
the
us
holocaust
memorial
museum
a
costly
and
dangerous
mistake
in
article
jake
livni
writes
through
private
contributions
on
federal
land
your
hatemongering
article
is
devoid
of
current
and
historical
fact
intellectual
content
and
social
value
down
the
toilet
it
goes
and
we
all
know
what
an
unbiased
source
the
nyt
is
when
it
comes
to
things
concerning
israel
neither
the
times
nor
the
trained
seals
who
have
responded
thus
far
seem
to
recognize
the
statement
that
these
private
funds
were
all
tax
exmpt
in
otherwords
american
taxpayers
put
up
at
least
of
the
money
and
finalyy
how
does
federal
land
mitigate
the
offensiveness
of
this
alien
monument
dedicated
to
perpetuating
pitty
and
the
continual
flow
of
tax
money
to
a
foreign
entity
that
federal
land
and
tax
money
could
have
been
used
to
commerate
americans
or
better
yet
to
house
homeless
americans
