re
israeli
destruction
of
mosques
in
jerusalem
in
article
writes
the
cases
arent
really
comparable
a
project
like
a
freeway
requires
public
hearings
court
action
appeals
advance
determination
of
restitution
and
so
on
the
razing
of
the
moghrabi
district
in
east
jerusalem
happened
within
hours
of
the
end
of
the
hostilities
of
the
day
war
the
residents
were
given
only
two
or
three
hours
notice
to
pack
up
and
find
accomodations
elsewhere
they
had
no
chance
of
public
hearing
debate
appeal
negotiation
or
anything
it
was
get
out
or
die
in
the
rubble
in
todays
jerusalem
post
magazine
there
is
a
feature
story
about
the
ongoing
restoration
of
synagogues
in
the
jewish
quarter
the
author
leah
abramowitz
writes
that
there
were
fiftyseven
synagogues
in
the
quarter
in
all
of
which
were
destroyed
some
she
says
used
as
donkey
stables
the
building
shells
that
is
i
still
find
it
really
really
hard
to
understand
why
the
demolition
of
the
buildings
in
front
of
the
kotel
continues
to
evoke
more
outrage
than
this
everything
is
so
much
cheaper
when
it
happens
to
the
jews
why
