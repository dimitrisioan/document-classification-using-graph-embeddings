this
implies
both
sides
are
equal
true
it
may
sometimes
be
difficult
or
still
living
in
an
alternate
universe
numerous
articles
in
major
newspapers
london
times
and
periodicals
newsweek
during
the
war
had
suggested
the
existence
of
a
significant
collaboration
between
armenians
and
the
nazis
arthur
derounian
deserves
credit
for
being
the
first
person
to
deal
with
this
issue
extensively
derounians
motives
were
twofold
his
deeply
held
democratic
convictions
gave
him
a
sense
of
duty
and
he
felt
obliged
to
shed
light
on
this
yet
another
dark
chapter
of
armenian
history
concurrently
derounian
embarked
on
what
one
would
call
crisis
control
or
facesaving
in
order
to
forestall
any
potential
attacks
on
the
larger
armenian
community
in
the
united
states
he
marginalized
collaboration
as
deplorable
but
insignificant

and
yet
another
historical
fact
a
fact
that
for
years
has
been
deliberately
forgotten
concealed
and
wiped
from
memory
the
fact
of
armeniannazi
collaboration
a
magazine
called
mitteilungsblatt
der
deutscharmenischen
gesselschaft
is
the
clearest
and
most
definite
proof
of
this
collaboration
the
magazine
was
first
published
in
berlin
in
during
nazi
rule
of
germany
and
continued
publication
until
the
end
of
even
the
name
of
the
magazine
which
implies
a
declaration
of
armeniannazi
cooperation
is
attentiongetting
this
magazine
every
issue
of
which
proves
the
collaboration
is
historically
important
as
documentary
evidence
it
is
a
heap
of
writing
that
should
be
an
admonition
to
world
opinion
and
to
all
mankind
in
nazi
germany
armenians
were
considered
to
be
an
aryan
race
and
certain
political
economic
and
social
rights
were
thus
granted
to
them
they
occupied
positions
in
public
service
and
were
partners
in
nazi
practices
the
whole
world
of
course
knows
what
awaited
those
who
were
not
considered
aryan
and
what
befell
them
now
