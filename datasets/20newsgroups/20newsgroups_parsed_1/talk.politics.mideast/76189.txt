one
of
the
two
ethnic
turkish
members
of

and
held
meetings
with
human

and

in

in
washington
dc
sadik
ahmet
explained
the
plight
of
ethnic
turks
in
greece
and
stated
six
demands
from
greek
government
ahmet
said
our
only
hope
in
greece
is
the
pressure
generated
from
western
capitals
for
insisting
that
greece
respects
the
human
rights
what
we
are
having
done
to
ethnic
turks
in
greece
is
exactly
the
same
as
south
african
apartheid
he
added
what
we
are
facing
is
pure
greek
hatred
and
racial
discrimination
spelling
out
the
demands
of
the
turkish
ethnic
community
in
greece
he
said
we
want
the
restoration
of
greek
citizenship
of
ethnic
turks
their
citizenship
was
revoked
by
using
the
excuse
that
this
people
have
stayed
out
of
greece
for
too
long
they
are
greek
citizens
and
are
residing
in
greece
even
one
of
them
is
actively
serving
in
the
greek
army
besides
other
nonturkish
citizens
of
greece
are
not
subject
to
this
kind
of
interpretation
at
an
extent
that
many
of
greekamericans
have
greek
citizenship
and
they
permanently
live
in
the
united
states
we
want
guarantee
for
turkish
minoritys
equal
rights
we
want
greek
government
to
accept
the
turkish
minority
and
grant
us
our
civil
rights
our
people
are
waiting
since
years
to
get
driving
licenses
the
greek
government
is
not
granting
building
permits
to
turks
for
renovating
our
buildings
or
building
new
ones
if
your
name
is
turkish
you
are
not
hired
to
the
government
offices
furthermore
we
want
greek
government
to
give
us
equal
opportunity
in
business
they
do
not
grant
licenses
so
we
can
participate
in
the
economic
life
of
greece
in
my
case
they
denied
me
a
medical
license
necessary
for
practicing
surgery
in
greek
hospitals
despite
the
fact
that
i
have
finished
a
greek
medical
school
and
followed
all
the
necessary
steps
in
my
career
we
want
freedom
of
expression
for
ethnic
turks
we
are
not
allowed
to
call
ourselves
turks
i
myself
have
been
subject
of
a
number
of
law
suits
and
even
have
been
imprisoned
just
because
i
called
myself
a
turk
we
also
want
greek
government
to
provide
freedom
of
religion
in
separate
interview
with
the
turkish
times
dr
sadik
ahmet
stated
that
the
conditions
of
ethnic
turks
are
deplorable
and
in
the
eyes
of
greek
laws
ethnic
greeks
are
more
equal
than
ethnic
turks
as
an
example
he
said
there
are
about
telephone
subscribers
in
selanik
thessaloniki
and
only
about
of
them
are
turks
that
is
not
because
turks
do
not
want
to
have
telephone
services
at
their
home
and
businesses
he
said
that
greek
government
changed
the
election
law
just
to
keep
him
out
of
the
parliament
as
an
independent
representative
and
they
stated
this
fact
openly
to
him
while
there
is
no
minimum
qualification
requirement
for
parties
in
terms
of
receiving
at
least
of
the
votes
they
imposed
this
requirement
for
the
independent
parties
including
the
turkish
candidates
ahmet
was
born
in
a
small
village
at
gumulcine
komotini
greece
he
earned
his
medical
degree
at
university
of
thessaloniki
in
he
served
in
the
greek
military
as
an
infantryman
in
he
got
involved
with
community
affairs
for
the
first
time
by
collecting
signatures
to
protest
the
unjust
implementation
of
laws
against
ethnic
turks
in
he
was
arrested
by
the
police
for
collecting
signatures
serdar
argic
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
turks
and
then
proceeded
in
the
work
of
extermination
ohanus
appressian
in
soviet
armenia
today
there
no
longer
exists
a
single
