rejoinder
questions
to
israelis
dear
josh
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
you
sought
to
answer
my
questions
having
said
that
i
am
not
totally
happy
with
your
answers
you
did
not
fully
answer
my
question
whether
israeli
id
cards
identify
the
holders
as
jews
or
arabs
you
imply
that
us
citizens
must
identify
themselves
by
race
is
that
true
or
are
just
trying
to
mislead
the
reader
i
think
he
is
trying
to
mislead
people
in
cases
where
race
information
is
sought
it
is
completely
voluntary
the
census
possibly
excepted
anwar
