re
israels
expansion
in
article
bha
writes
just
a
couple
of
questions
for
the
proisraeli
lobby
out
there
is
israels
occupation
of
southern
lebanon
temporary
for
mr
stein
i
am
working
on
a
proof
for
you
that
israel
is
diverting
water
to
the
jordan
river
away
from
lebanese
territory
yes
it
is
as
has
been
evidenced
by
the
previous
two
stages
of
withdrawal
from
the
area
and
by
the
reductions
in
troops
currently
the
troops
are
kept
at
a
level
consistent
with
light
and
armored
patrols
no
permanent
installations
have
been
built
in
the
area
nor
are
any
planned
as
to
the
prodigal
water
question
you
can
continue
to
waste
your
time
looking
for
nonexistent
proof
or
you
can
accept
the
testimony
of
people
here
some
lebanese
who
have
acknowledged
that
they
know
of
no
evidence
for
these
allegations
is
israels
occupation
of
the
west
bank
gaza
and
golan
temporary
if
so
for
those
of
you
who
support
it
why
were
so
many
settlers
moved
into
the
territories
if
it
is
not
temporary
lets
hear
it
it
depends
which
of
those
territories
you
refer
to
in
general
settlers
were
moved
into
the
territories
because
at
the
time
in
the
context
of
the
situations
it
seemed
the
logical
move
this
is
not
to
say
that
views
dont
change
or
that
mistakes
are
not
made
currently
i
would
say
that
the
only
disputed
territory
that
does
not
appear
to
be
temporary
is
that
of
eastern
and
northern
jerusalem
