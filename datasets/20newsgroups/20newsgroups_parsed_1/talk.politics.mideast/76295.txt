subject
re
the
israeli
press
mark
ira
kaufman
writes
for
your
information
on
israel
since
i
read
both
american
media
and
israeli
media
i
can
say
with
absolute
certainty
that
anybody
who
reliesx
exclusively
on
the
american
press
for
knowledge
about
israel
does
not
have
a
true
picture
of
what
is
going
on
of
course
you
never
read
arab
media
i
read
arab
israeli
jer
post
and
this
network
is
more
than
enough
and
western
american
french
and
british
reports
and
i
can
say
that
if
we
give
israel
and
arabs
on
the
bias
scale
of
course
you
can
switch
the
polarities
israeli
newspapers
will
get
either
a
or
american
leading
newspapers
and
tv
news
range
from
to
yes
there
are
some
that
are
more
israelis
than
israelis
the
montreal
suburban
a
local
free
newspaper
probably
is
closer
to
kahanes
views
than
some
israeli
right
wing
newspapers
british
range
from
neutral
to
french
that
iknow
of
of
course
range
from
afrofrench
magazines
to
arab
official
media
range
from
to
egyptian
to
in
sa
why
no
because
they
do
not
want
to
overdo
it
and
stir
people
against
israel
and
therefore
against
them
since
they
are
doing
nothing
as
to
the
claim
that
israeli
papers
are
biased
of
course
they
are
some
may
lean
to
the
right
or
the
left
just
like
the
media
here
in
america
but
they
still
report
events
about
which
people
here
know
nothing
i
choose
to
form
my
opinions
about
israel
and
the
mideast
based
on
more
knowledge
than
does
an
average
american
who
relies
exclusively
on
an
american
media
which
does
not
report
on
events
in
the
mideast
with
any
consistency
or
accuracy
the
average
bias
of
what
you
read
would
be
probably
around
while
that
of
the
average
american
would
be
the
same
if
they
do
not
read
or
read
the
newyork
times
and
similar
newsmakers
and
if
they
read
some
other
relatively
less
biased
newspapers
so
you
are
not
better
off
