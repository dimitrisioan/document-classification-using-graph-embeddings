first
my
above
statement
doesnot
say
that
the
existence
of
israeli
citizens
in
the
wb
revoke
their
right
of
life
but
it
says
the
israeli
occupation
of
the
wb
revoke
the
right
of
life
for
somemost
its
citizens
basically
revokes
the
right
of
for
its
military
men
clearly
occupation
is
an
undeclared
war
during
war
attacks
against
military
targets
are
fully
legitimate
id
like
you
to
tell
me
in
your
own
words
who
the
military
are
wrt
israel
then
in
uniform
or
not
on
duty
or
offduty
soldier
to
be
or
not
that
is
since
its
compulsory
one
might
regard
any
israeli
as
a
legit
target
using
that
definition
in
uniform
or
not
doesnot
make
a
difference
if
the
person
is
in
army
on
duty
or
offduty
doesnot
matter
if
the
army
man
was
on
duty
or
on
a
vacation
week
soldier
to
be
or
not
sure
i
meant
only
military
men
just
trying
to
get
this
clear
so
please
bear
with
me
as
far
as
i
can
tell
youre
proposing
the
following
rules
of
engagement
between
israel
and
the
palestinean
resistance
please
feel
revise
this
preliminary
draft
as
necessary
israeli
military
personnel
are
fair
game
at
any
time
in
uniform
or
out
on
duty
or
off
in
practice
since
any
male
or
female
israeli
of
military
age
may
be
offduty
military
all
but
young
children
are
acceptable
targets
since
the
existence
of
israel
constitutes
indication
of
hostile
intent
no
further
provocation
is
required
to
avoid
inpermissable
violations
of
the
rights
of
noncombatant
palestineans
israeli
forces
must
not
engage
palestineans
without
positive
identification
as
military
personnel
clear
indication
of
aggressive
intent
and
a
clear
field
of
fire
a
positive
identification
may
be
assured
by
either
checking
for
palestinean
military
uniform
by
posession
of
exclusively
military
armament
ie
t
mbts
or
mig
aircraft
or
selfidentification
either
verbal
or
documentary
note
that
dualuse
militarycivilian
weaponry
such
as
hand
grenades
ak
rifles
and
rpg
launchers
do
not
constitute
positive
military
identification
and
require
closer
inspection
such
as
document
checks
b
aggressive
intent
as
distinct
from
merely
hostile
intent
which
is
the
normal
condition
may
be
assured
by
not
less
than
three
rounds
of
incoming
fire
separated
by
intervals
of
not
less
than
ten
seconds
between
rounds
note
that
a
single
burst
of
automaticweapon
fire
counds
as
one
round
as
does
a
volley
of
rocket
fire
from
more
than
one
source
as
noted
above
dualuse
weaponry
may
not
be
assumed
to
originate
from
military
personnel
and
thus
do
not
justify
armed
response
c
a
clear
field
of
fire
can
be
guaranteed
by
making
a
positive
military
identification
of
all
personnel
in
the
target
area
of
the
weapons
to
be
used
note
that
aggressive
intent
need
not
be
proven
for
all
possible
targets
thus
if
iaf
aircraft
are
attacked
by
a
sam
crew
it
is
not
necessary
to
check
the
papers
of
each
crew
member
so
long
as
none
are
obviously
civilians
as
indicated
for
instance
by
the
posession
of
uniquely
civilian
weaponry
such
as
stones
axes
and
molotov
coctails
since
it
is
often
difficult
for
iaf
elements
to
land
and
make
the
necessary
checks
ground
forces
should
first
screen
prospective
strike
areas
before
agm
fire
for
acm
purposes
a
cockpittocockpit
pass
within
meters
is
usually
sufficient
for
this
purpose
but
may
be
repeated
if
necessary
