the
phrase
the
jewish
pioneers
will
make
the
desert
bloom
was
trumpeted
throughout
the
western
world
after
the
six
day
war
in
david
bengurion
declared
in
a
letter
to
charles
de
gaulle
its
by
our
pioneering
creation
that
we
have
transformed
a
poor
and
arid
land
into
a
fertile
land
created
builtup
areas
towns
and
villages
in
abandoned
desert
areas
contrary
to
bengurions
assertion
it
must
be
affirmed
that
during
the
years
of
the
british
mandate
over
palestine
and
for
centuries
previous
a
productive
human
presence
was
to
be
found
in
all
parts
of
the
negev
desert
in
the
very
arid
hills
and
valleys
of
the
southern
negev
as
well
as
in
the
more
fertile
north
these
were
the
bedouin
arabs
the
real
desertification
of
the
negev
mainly
in
the
southern
part
occurred
after
israels
dispossession
of
the
bedouins
cultivated
lands
and
pastures
nowadays
the
majority
of
the
squarekilometer
negev
which
represents
percent
of
the
state
of
israel
pre
borders
has
been
desertified
beyond
recognition
the
main
new
occupiers
of
the
formerly
bedouin
negev
are
the
israeli
army
the
nature
reserves
authority
whose
chief
role
is
to
prevent
bedouin
from
roaming
their
former
pasture
lands
and
vast
industrial
zones
including
nuclear
reactors
and
dumping
grounds
for
chemical
nuclear
and
other
wastes
israeli
jews
in
the
negev
today
cultivate
less
than
half
the
surface
area
cultivated
by
the
bedouin
before
and
there
is
no
jewish
pastoral
activity
i
agricultural
and
pastoral
activities
of
the
negev
bedouin
before
and
after
in
according
to
british
mandatory
statistics
the
beersheba
subdistrict
which
corresponds
more
or
less
to
israels
negev
or
southern
district
had
inhabitants
almost
all
bedouin
arabs
who
held
camels
cows
and
oxen
sheep
and
goats
the
majority
of
the
bedouin
lived
a
more
or
less
sedentary
life
in
the
north
where
precipitation
ranged
between
and
mm
per
year
in
they
cultivated
about
hectares
of
the
beersheba
district
ie
percent
of
its
total
area
and
more
than
double
the
area
cultivated
by
the
negevs
jewish
settlers
after
years
of
making
the
desert
bloom
the
bedouin
had
a
very
low
crop
yield
to
kilograms
of
barley
per
hectare
during
rainy
years
and
their
farming
techniques
were
primitive
but
production
was
based
solely
on
animal
and
human
labor
it
must
also
be
underscored
that
animal
production
although
low
was
based
entirely
on
pasturing
production
increased
considerably
during
the
rainy
years
and
diminished
significantly
during
drought
years
all
bedouin
pasture
animals
goats
camels
and
sheep
had
the
ability
to
gain
weight
quickly
over
the
relatively
rainy
winters
and
to
withstand
many
waterless
days
during
the
hot
summers
these
animals
were
the
result
of
a
centuriesold
process
of
natural
selection
in
harsh
local
conditions
after
the
creation
of
the
state
of
israel
percent
of
the
negev
bedouin
were
expelled
to
the
sinai
or
to
southern
jordan
the
who
were
allowed
to
remain
were
confined
to
a
territory
of
hectares
in
a
region
were
annual
mean
precipiation
was
mm
a
quantity
low
enough
to
ensure
a
crop
failure
two
years
out
of
three
the
rare
water
wells
in
the
south
and
central
negev
spring
of
life
in
the
desert
were
cemented
to
prevent
bedouin
shepherds
from
roaming
a
few
bedouin
shepherds
were
allowed
to
stay
in
the
central
negev
but
after
when
the
sinai
was
returned
to
egypt
these
bedouin
were
also
eliminated
at
the
same
time
strong
pressure
was
applied
on
the
bedouin
to
abandon
cultivation
of
their
fields
in
order
that
the
land
could
be
transferred
to
the
army
no
reliable
statistics
exist
concerning
the
amount
of
land
held
today
by
negev
bedouin
it
is
a
known
fact
that
a
large
part
of
the
hectares
they
cultivated
in
the
s
has
been
seized
by
the
israeli
authorities
indeed
most
of
the
bedouin
are
now
confined
to
seven
development
towns
or
sowetos
established
for
them
