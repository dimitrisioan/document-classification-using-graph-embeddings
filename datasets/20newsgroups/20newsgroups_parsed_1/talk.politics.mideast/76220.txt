by

hard
by
the
washington
monument
within
clear
view
of
the
jefferson
memorial
an
easy
stroll
down
the
mall
to
the
majestic
lincoln
memorial
has
arisen
on
some
of
the
most
hallowed
territory
of
the
united
states
of
america
a
costly
and
dangerous
mistake
on
ground
where
no
monument
yet
marks
countless
sacrifices
and
unheralded
achievements
of
americans
of
all
races
and
creeds
in
the
building
and
defense
of
this
nation
sits
today
a
massive
and
costly
edifice
devoted
above
all
to
a
contentious
and
false
version
of
the
ordeal
in
europe
during
world
war
ii
of
nonamerican
members
of
a
minority
sectarian
group
now
in
the
deceptive
guise
of
tolerance
the
united
states
holocaust
memorial
museum
begins
a
propaganda
campaign
financed
through
the
unwitting
largess
of
the
american
taxpayer
in
the
interests
of
israel
and
its
adherents
in
america
after
reading
the
first
paragraph
a
quick
scan
confirmed
my
first
impression
this
is
a
bunch
of
revisionist
and
antisemitic
hogwash
the
ny
times
reported
on
april
that
the
museum
was
built
through
private
contributions
on
federal
land
your
hatemongering
article
is
devoid
of
current
and
historical
fact
intellectual
content
and
social
value
down
the
toilet
it
