how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a
bunch
of
cops
putting
their
lives
on
the
line
day
in
and
day
out
who
are
afraid
as
hell
of
a
large
black
guy
that
took
a
large
amount
of
punishment
and
refused
submit
im
curious
why
you
think
that
particular
adjective
is
important
im
curious
why
you
took
a
beign
statement
and
crossposted
it
to
several
different
news
groups
including
something
along
the
lines
of
altdiscrimination
look
rodney
king
is
black
and
large
i
have
several
large
black
male
friendsand
they
are
referred
to
as
being
large
black
men
to
their
faces
and
by
themselves
you
know
ted
i
have
a
large
number
of
adjectives
for
you
but
i
will
spare
you
most
of
them
because
i
try
not
to
get
into
personal
flame
wars
let
me
just
say
that
i
think
your
action
of
cross
posting
this
was
total
bs
and
youre
trying
to
start
some
crap
hopefully
others
will
see
through
your
trite
little
game
and
not
play
along
