i
would
be
upset
that
although
abortions
would
continue
they
would
be
a
lot
more
expensive
for
the
rich
and
a
lot
less
safe
for
the
poor
so
now
things
are
supposed
to
be
legal
just
to
keep
their
cost
down
and
the
safety
factor
high
think
about
it
shouldnt
all
drugs
then
be
legalized
it
would
lower
the
cost
and
definitely
make
them
safer
to
use
yes
i
dont
think
we
want
to
start
using
these
criterion
to
determine
legality
why
not
where
do
they
get
these
people
i
really
dont
want
to
waste
time
in
here
to
do
battle
about
the
legalization
of
drugs
if
you
really
want
to
we
can
get
into
it
and
prove
just
how
idiotic
that
idea
is
go
for
it
i
have
yet
to
see
anybody
justify
the
prohibition
on
drugs
and
the
ensuing
war
on
drugs
in
the
world
of
politics
here
on
usenet
it
is
you
that
is
crazy
anybodywho
gives
the
matter
any
thought
beyond
reading
headlinescannot
justify
this
atrocity
this
all
out
war
on
individual
rights
just
try
to
justify
the
war
on
drugs
i
dare
you
my
point
was
that
it
is
pretty
stupid
to
justify
legalizing
something
just
because
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
once
again
in
chorus
why
is
this
stupid
a
few
more
ideas
to
hold
to
these
criterion
prostitution
the
killing
of
all
funny
farm
patients
aids
victims
elderly
unemployed
prisioners
etc
this
would
surely
make
my
taxes
decrease
the
above
paragraph
is
gibberishthat
all
i
can
make
of
it
