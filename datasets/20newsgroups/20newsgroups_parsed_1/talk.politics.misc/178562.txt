the
fact
that
the
south
had
a
number
of
slave
owners
is
true
but
relatively
small
numbers
around
had
more
than
a
few
hundred
slaves
i
have
to
get
references
that
i
do
not
have
here
for
exact
numbers
if
it
has
any
bearing
on
this
discussion
i
saw
a
figure
for
the
total
number
of
slaveowners
as
does
anyone
have
a
figure
for
how
many
slaves
there
were
how
many
farmers
without
slaves
