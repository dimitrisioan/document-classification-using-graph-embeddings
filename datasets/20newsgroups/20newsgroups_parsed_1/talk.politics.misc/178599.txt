many
environmentalists
attributed
the
drought
in
the
us
to
global
warming
but
researchers
with
the
national
center
for
atmospheric
research
in
boulder
colorado
reported
that
the
freakish
weather
was
actually
due
to
a
natural
phenomenon
the
interaction
of
el
nino
and
el
nina
two
massive
currents
in
the
tropical
pacific
el
nino
is
a
huge
strip
of
warm
water
that
periodically
appears
off
the
coast
of
south
america
and
disrupts
the

weather
patterns
now
and
then
it
alternates
with
el

a

that

the

cold

the
result
was
both
the

the

the
february
issue
of

digest
reported
that
an
international
team
of
researchers
has
discovered
that
termites
generate
more
than
twice
the
carbon
dioxide
that
fuel
burning
does
according
to
a
study
reported
in
science
for
november
the
estimated
gross
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
produced
by
termites
was
more
than
twice
the
net
global
input
from
fossil
fuel
combustion
in
addition
termites
are
a
potentially
important
source
of
atmospheric
methane
they
could
account
for
a
large
fraction
of
global
emmisions
the
woodeating
pests
have
a
bacteria
that
enables
them
too
digest
carbon
so
efficiently
that
some

is
converted
too
carbon
dioxide
methane
and
other
gases
they
belch
into

ants
are
another
natural
source
of
pollution
in
an
atmospheric
chemist
with
bell
laboratories
and
zoologists
from
cornell
university
reported
that
ants
of
the
subfamily
formicinae
make
and
store
huge
quantities
of
the
formic
acid
that
contributes
most
of
the
acidity
of
rain
that
falls
in
remote
areas
and
is
found
in
atmosphere
gas
and
precepitation
around
the
globe
it
is
abundant
for
instance
in
the
fog
and
mists
that
hang
over
the
rain
forests
of
central
africa
according
to
the
july
insight
magazine
the
ants
release
the
acid
when
defending
themselves
and
communicating
with
each
other
and
upon
dying
since
percent
of
the
world
ant
population
belongs
to
this
subfamily
there
is
significant
concern
about
the
acid
the
ants
release
an
amount
estimated
at
metric
tons
annually
which
is
equal
to
the
combined
formic
acid
contributions
of
automobiles
refuse
combustion
