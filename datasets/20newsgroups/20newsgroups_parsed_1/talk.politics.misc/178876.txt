writes
also
in
the
april
globe
and
mail
there
was
a
letter
from
the
director
of
trauma
services
at
st
michaels
hospital
in
toronto
responding
to
an
article
on
a
study
comparing
heart
surgery
in
california
and
canada
in
which
some
canadian
doctor
worried
that
that
study
which
was
in
the
nejm
i
think
noted
that
the
frequency
of
heart
surgery
on
patients
over
seventy
increase
with
income
in
california
i
guess
richer
people
have
more
heart
disease
in
california
whereas
the
frequency
of
surgery
on
patients
over
seventy
in
canada
was
relatively
uniform
across
income
distribution
heart
surgery
was
more
frequent
in
california
but
mortality
and
outcomes
were
essentially
the
same
american
analysts
would
seize
on
the
results
as
proof
that
canada
rationed
vital
services
the
doctor
i
cant
recall
his
name
said
that
canada
is
rationing
vital
services
as
any
physician
can
plainly
see
he
said
that
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
different
from
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
the
government
cant
afford
it
as
a
result
of
deliberate
underfunding
of
the
health
insurance
plan
in
fairness
he
did
say
that
both
the
us
and
canadian
systems
are
in
the
same
situation
the
ndp
cleaning
up
a
tory
spending
mess
and
just
when
i
thought
i
understood
canadian
politics
there
was
one
about
a
group
of
doctors
in
calgary
who
have
opened
canadas
first
usstyle
mri
clinic
as
an
alternative
to
the
provincially
owned
one
its
about
time
ive
ragged
on
my
own
doctor
friends
as
to
why
they
dont
invest
in
their
own
private
practices
in
the
end
its
their
money
but
they
choose
to
spend
it
on
americas
cup
pipedreams
and
thats
none
of
my
business
as
for
provincially
owned
for
sure
its
against
the
law
in
canada
for
governments
to
be
directly
involved
in
the
provision
of
health
care
except
in
the
military
or
native
reser
vations
what
that
term
actually
means
is
that
the
facility
gets
by
on
public
grants
to
meet
shortfall
from
lack
of
use
no
kidding
medical
practice
itself
is
much
more
conservative
up
north
my
own
best
friend
did
two
clerkships
at
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochester
mn
and
is
no
stranger
to
high
tech
medicine
but
his
boat
comes
first
there
were
some
people
expressing
concern
that
it
was
the
first
wedge
of
twotiered
health
care
and
that
it
might
violate
the
canada
health
act
no
its
probably
socialist
whiners
who
are
offended
that
we
have
private
practices
and
always
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyways
so
why
not
have
a
particular
facility
the
canadian
big
government
mentality
often
imagines
government
where
it
does
not
even
exist
the
only
potential
problem
i
see
with
the
private
mri
facilty
in
calgary
is
the
selfreferral
problem
to
the
facility
for
the
doctors
who
have
a
financial
interest
in
it
which
is
basically
unethicalbut
in
canada
because
of
our
small
population
there
is
likely
only
to
be
a
few
private
facilities
involving
only
a
small
number
of
doctors
and
thus
i
dont
think
the
selfreferral
problem
which
is
an
epidemic
in
the
us
could
ever
get
out
of
hand
here
look
nobody
stopped
the
clinic
when
they
planned
on
the
mri
nobody
stopped
them
when
they
bought
it
nobody
seems
to
be
stopping
them
from
using
it
either
much
ado
about
nothing
thank
goodness
that
hockey
playoffs
have
started
it
is
an
experiment
that
will
be
certainly
be
watched
carefully
while
it
seemed
currently
unjustified
there
was
one
anecdote
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstrate
the
mri
he
showed
an
image
of
an
injured
knee
which
happened
to
belong
to
the
manager
of
the
bank
who
approved
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provincial
mri
then
another
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscles
would
have
atrophied
and
rehabilitation
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tiers
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exaggeration
somewhere
because
the
gao
study
of
canada
cited
often
on
usenet
did
not
find
access
to
mri
to
be
a
problem
ill
bet
the
doctor
is
relying
on
people
having
listened
to
american
trash
talk
on
cable
so
that
he
can
puff
his
chest
a
bit
there
are
already
a
few
treatment
regimens
for
knee
injuries
without
relying
on
mri
unfortunately
ive
had
a
few
and
im
not
a
banker
what
likely
happened
is
the
sponsors
of
the
private
mri
which
include
doctors
anticipated
that
alberta
would
need
more
mris
and
instead
of
waiting
for
the
health
planners
to
realize
they
needed
another
one
or
two
saw
a
business
opportunitywhere
they
would
have
a
secure
business
from
the
public
insurance
side
of
things
and
they
could
supplement
people
and
businesses
who
want
to
pay
cash
