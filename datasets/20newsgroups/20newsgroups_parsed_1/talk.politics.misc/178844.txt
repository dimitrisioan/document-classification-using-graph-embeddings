the
news
last
night
clinton
was
bashing
the
republicans
for
stonewalling
his
so
called
stimulus
package
it
seems
that
one
small
item
within
this
package
was
going
to
pay
for
free
immunizations
for
poor
kids
immunizations
for
children
in
this
country
are
already
free
if
you
care
to
go
have
it
done
the
problem
is
not
the
cost
it
is
the
irresponible
parents
who
are
to
stupid
or
to
lazy
to
have
it
done
in
case
you
havent
noticed
clintonites
are
pushing
a
universal
health
care
access
program
access
here
means
that
folks
who
do
not
give
a
damn
about
immunizing
their
children
will
have
health
care
services
delivered
to
their
doorsteps
ive
read
about
more
than
a
few
of
these
programs
that
ran
into
problems
in
convincing
parents
to
get
their
children
immunized
even
when
they
were
delivered
to
their
doorstep
i
dont
know
maybe
that
sheet
they
have
to
be
informed
of
about
possible
risks
side
effects
and
bad
reactions
scares
them
the
immunization
program
is
just
a
useful
first
step
among
other
things
the
money
will
go
to
pay
for
creating
and
maintaning
a
a
computerized
innoculation
database
on
all
us
children
codenamed
big
mother
just
kidding
the
name
will
be
children
defense
database
or
something
like
that
once
the
money
is
spent
and
little
or
no
tangible
results
achieved
the
goverment
will
have
to
start
knocking
down
doors
in
some
neigborhoods
and
bribe
parents
in
others
probably
the
ones
that
are
paying
kids
for
attending
the
school
what
a
fantastic
idea
