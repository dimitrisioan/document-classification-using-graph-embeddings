however
legalizing
it
and
just
sticking
some
drugs
in
gas
stations
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
plus
i
have
never
heard
of
a
recommended
dosage
for
drugs
like
crack
ecstasy
chrystal
meth
and
lsd
the
minute
report
said
it
worked
with
cocaine
cigarettes
pot
and
heroin
or
the
government
could
adopt
the
radical
and
probably
unamerican
idea
that
citizens
are
free
to
live
their
lives
as
they
wish
and
simply
decriminalize
cocaine
marijuana
heroin
lsd
etc
please
explain
why
the
idea
of
allowing
recreational
drugs
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
after
all
it
works
just
fine
for
nicotine
im
all
in
favor
of
drug
legalization
but
i
do
see
some
problems
with
it
my
hope
is
that
people
disposed
to
doing
so
would
simply
overdose
quickly
and
be
done
with
it
before
making
a
mess
of
thisgs
its
actually
quite
simple
we
sell
drug
use
licenses
to
anybody
over
age
who
wants
one
costs
and
youre
required
to
attend
a
week
of
night
classes
on
the
effects
of
drugs
on
the
human
body
at
the
end
of
the
class
you
sign
an
informed
consent
waiver
acknowledging
that
youve
been
told
that
drugs
are
bad
for
you
but
you
want
them
anyway
in

you
giver
up
any
right
to

medical
care
for
whatever
might
happen
to
you
as
a
result
of
doing
drugs
or
any
right
to
collect
welfare
or
unemployment
should
you
lose
your
job
as
a
result
of
using
drugs
youd
also
give
up
your
right
to
drive
a
car
anybody
caught
using
drugs
without
a

has
a
choice
pay
