the
selective
service
registration
should
be
abolished
to
start
with
the
draft
is
immoral
whether
you
agree
with
that
or
not
we
dont
have
one
now
and
military
experts
agree
that
the
quality
of
the
armed
forces
is
superior
with
a
volunteer
army
than
with
draftees
finally
the
government
has
us
on
many
lists
in
many
computers
the
irs
social
security
admistration
and
motor
vehicle
registries
to
name
a
few
and
it
can
find
us
if
it
needs
to
maintaining
yet
another
list
of
people
is
an
utter
waste
of
money
and
time
lets
axe
this
whole
department
and
reduce
the
deficit
a
little
bit
let
me
say
this
about
that
as
a
retired
navy
officer
i
agree
cut
it
but
lets
not
stop
there
eliminate
the
c
transport
overwight
overdue

it
was
supposed
to
carry
tanks
new
tanks
are
now
too
big
for
the

scrap
the

ssn
nuclear
submarine
the
breakup
of
the
ussr
has
left
us
with
a
number
of
sticky
military
problems
but
none
of
them
will
require
gods

submarines
ground
the
b
stealth
bomber
im
sure
its
a
great
airplane
that
will
do
everything
its
designers
said
but
at
halfagigabuck
a

we
cant
afford
for
even
one
to
crash
and
airplanes
do
crash
