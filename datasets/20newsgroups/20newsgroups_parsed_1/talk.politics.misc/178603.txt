subject
re
new
study
out
on
gay
percentage
in
article
clayton
cramer
writes
so
what
homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in
child
molestation
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
back
your
statments
with
proof
or
shut
up
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
million
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
million
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
but
many
of
the
people
who
will
be
marching
arent
homosexuals
but
other
members
of
the
leftist
agenda
again
back
your
statements
or
shut
up
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
dont
forget
that
had
or
more
partners
not
surprising
remember
that
study
includes
homosexuals
as
well
hmm
tell
me
did
you
go
to
the
mickey
mouse
school
of
logic
you
have
just
stated
that
there
are
not
many
homosexuals
as
kinsey
reported
in
his
survey
and
the
surveys
of
the
kinsey
institute
since
then
you
say
that
the
reason
many
young
people
are
promiscuous
is
because
homosexuals
form
a
large
part
of
that
group
or
there
are
some
homosexuals
whose
lives
consist
of
having
sex
with
no
gaps
for
eating
c
using
your
logic
it
would
seem
to
suggest
that
on
average
gay
men
have
about
partners
each
a
week
try
to
think
through
your
arguments
carefully
or
then
again
not
because
i
like
to
laugh
every
now
and
then
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
and
what
did
this
study
show
for
number
of
sexual
contacts
for
those
who
said
they
where
homosexual
or
is
that
number
to
inconvient
for
you
it
wasnt
published
hence
the
argument
can
not
be
resolved
using
this
data
next
point
please
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
fuck
off
typical
homoseuxal
response
this
depends
on
the
premise
that
there
are
only
three
types
of
behaviour
gay
bi
and
hetero
this
has
yet
to
be
proved
see
an
earlier
post
about
the
kinsey
institute
of
grading
this
although
rough
seems
more
logical
also
you
use
this
would
show
defining
a
fact
and
not
an
assumption
again
back
your
statements
or
shut
