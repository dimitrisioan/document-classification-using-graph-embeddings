how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a
bunch
of
cops
putting
their
lives
on
the
line
day
in
and
day
out
who
are
afraid
as
hell
of
a
large
black
guy
that
took
a
large
amount
of
punishment
and
refused
submit
im
curious
why
you
think
that
particular
adjective
is
important
im
curious
why
you
took
a
beign
statement
and
crossposted
it
to
several
different
news
groups
including
something
along
the
lines
of
altdiscrimination
exsqueeze
me
i
saw
your
original
post
in
altdiscrimination
your
post
was
crossposted
to
three
groups
my
followup
was
crossposted
to
two
of
those
three
omitting
socmotss
now
instead
of
engaging
in
metadiscussion
off
the
topic
could
you
answer
the
question
posed
if
your
statement
is
so
beign
you
should
have
no
trouble
politely
responding
to
a
polite
query
well
i
dont
think
your
query
was
exactly
polite
but
i
will
try
to
give
you
a
polite
responce
something
atypical
of
the
net
but
here
it
goes
black
is
a
descriptive
adjective
that
describes
mr
king
from
many
of
the
newspaper
radio
and
tv
news
reports
i
have
seen
this
adjective
is
commonly
in
front
of
his
name
i
have
never
seen
anyone
complain
about
the
use
of
this
adjective
when
used
in
a
benign
manner
i
did
not
say
that
mr
king
was
a
no
good
black
i
do
not
know
mr
king
and
would
not
make
this
ascertian
without
some
evidence
to
this
effect
i
used
it
purely
as
a
descriptive
adjective
in
the
same
manner
than
many
most
news
people
have
used
it
in
the
past
the
entire
second
trial
was
about
race
ted
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
discuss
mr
kings
racial
background
but
had
mr
king
been
white
there
would
not
have
been
a
second
trial
you
probably
are
saying
that
the
beating
would
not
have
occurred
if
he
were
white
but
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
call
to
make
it
is
possible
the
case
but
not
definately
i
still
think
your
actions
are
crap
ted
they
are
far
more
divisive
than
me
using
the
adjective
black
in
a
nonderogenory
manner
would
you
have
been
happier
if
i
had
used
africanamerican
if
so
then
you
really
are
lost
in
the
world
of
pc
you
have
already
been
instrumental
in
getting
one
persons
net
access
revoked
and
i
wonder
if
you
have
sent
a
copy
of
my
message
to
my
sys
admin
with
a
plea
that
i
am
not
worthy
of
posting
the
way
you
went
about
this
polite
inquiry
makes
me
believe
it
was
anything
but
