writes
on
the
news
last
night
clinton
was
bashing
the
republicans
for
stonewalling
his
so
called
stimulus
package
it
seems
that
one
small
item
within
this
package
was
going
to
pay
for
free
immunizations
for
poor
kids
so
now
clinton
is
claiming
that
the
republicans
are
holding
the
health
of
poor
kids
hostage
for
blatantly
political
gains
aside
from
the
merits
or
lack
thereof
of
another
free
immunization
program
just
what
is
such
a
program
doing
in
a
bill
that
is
supposedly
about
creating
jobs
jobs
what
the
hell
have
jobs
to
do
with
it
its
another
touchyfeely
program
from
the
new
vapid
administration
the
fact
is
the
major
claim
made
for
universal
immunization
that
all
children
will
be
immunized
has
absolutely
no
validity
several
states
already
have
ui
programs
have
had
these
programs
for
years
the
result
on
average
their
success
rates
are
no
better
than
the
national
average
it
seems
that
the
gummint
hasnt
yet
figured
out
a
way
to
make
parents
bring
their
kids
in
yet
another
case
of
shameless
demagoguery
from
the
new
democrats
the
agents
of
change
if
clinton
is
so
hot
to
get
this
immunization
program
why
doesnt
he
and
the
democrats
just
introduce
it
as
a
stand
alone
bill
isnt
it
possible
that
clinton
is
the
one
doing
the
blatant
political
read
pork
manipulations
here
he
is
telling
the
republicans
pass
my
mutibillion
dollar
package
or
i
will
go
to
the
people
and
tell
them
that
you
are
opposed
to
immunizing
poor
kids
what
clinton
using
this
issue
for
partisan
gain
do
tell
i
have
never
thought
highly
of
clinton
but
stunts
like
this
lower
my
opinion
of
him
even
further
i
thought
one
of
clintons
campaign
themes
was
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
new
kind
of
politician
this
kind
of
manuevering
would
have
made
lbj
proud
all
together
now
cmon
you
know
the
words
meet
the
new
boss
same
as
the
old
boss
and
the
chorus
we
wont
get
fooled
