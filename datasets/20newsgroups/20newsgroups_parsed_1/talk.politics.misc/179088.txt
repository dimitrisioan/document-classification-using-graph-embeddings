writes
the
murderes
of
four
police
officers
to
justice
perhaps
we
could
hear
it
they
had
a
surefire
method
keep
them
bottled
up
and
talk
them
to
death
or
surrender
without
giving
him
justification
for
some
looneytune
religious
stunt
phil
ive
been
reading
your
postings
for
months
and
im
convinced
that
you
will
back
anything
no
matter
how
damaging
it
may
be
to
yours
or
anyone
elses
rights
if
you
think
it
will
hurt
people
you
dont
like
its
people
with
that
attitude
that
set
up
the
preconditions
for
the
holocaust
a
process
that
is
in
place
now
in
this
country
even
if
the
tattered
pitiful
remains
of
the
constitution
is
slowing
its
progress
this
isnt
a
libertarian
issue
others
may
argue
that
line
but
from
a
strictly
constitutional
view
of
a
democratic
govt
what
the
fbi
and
batf
did
was
wrong
wrong
wrong
even
if
their
reasons
for
trying
to
arrest
koresh
were
right
anything
that
leads
to
the
deaths
of
children
if
nothing
else
touches
your
stoney
heart
is
wrong
no
matter
who
pushed
the
button
for
gods
sake
man
get
your
morality
back
the
person
who
murdered
children
was
koresh
he
kept
them
there
and
brought
about
their
deaths
deliberately
you
may
consider
that
i
am
a
complete
bastard
and
a
not
very
nice
chap
thats
quite
true
i
dont
pretend
to
be
being
nice
is
what
amateurs
try
to
do
if
you
want
to
talk
politics
you
are
talking
hard
decisions
such
as
whether
the
lives
of
the
troops
should
be
risked
attempting
to
rescue
the
children
anyone
who
has
held
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
since
fdr
has
held
the
threat
that
if
the
usa
or
its
allies
were
to
be
threatened
then
the
usa
would
risk
nuclear
holocaust
in
order
to
protect
freedom
beleive
it
or
not
that
is
not
the
sort
of
threat
that
nice
chaps
make
do
they
have
a
gun
nutters
section
of
the
us
version
of
cnd
by
any
chance
there
are
cases
where
society
has
to
be
protected
from
madmen
such
as
koresh
or
hitler
if
it
were
not
for
the
consideration
of
the
children
in
there
the
question
of
the
tactics
to
be
used
would
not
be
a
matter
of
anything
but
academic
significance
it
is
not
for
the
govt
to
prevent
people
from
commiting
mass
suicide
the
latest
reports
are
that
cult
members
were
shot
attempting
to
leave
the
compound
by
koresh
loyalists
during
the
fire
if
proven
that
would
entail
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
of
those
who
want
to
promote
koresh
as
some
sort
of
role
model
or
hero
i
need
hardly
add
that
it
is
koresh
that
has
created
the
holocaust
in
this
case
by
the
deliberate
arson
of
the
ranch
appocalypse
let
me
see
if
i
got
this
right
group
of
religious
plinter
schismatics
erect
a
compound
and
after
at
least
fifty
years
of
peaceful
coexistance
with
the
outside
community
having
shoot
outs
only
with
each
other
this
makes
them
dangerous
prior
history
would
seem
to
indicate
they
are
only
dangerous
to
themselves
last
i
knew
there
was
no
national
branch
davidian
party
blaming
the
debacle
in
veitnam
on
foreign
meddlers
and
threetwo
beer
calling
for
the
rounding
up
of
meat
packers
growers
and
slaughter
houses
you
want
tough
political
choices
how
about
letting
odd
balls
be
odd
balls
i
know
this
requires
tolerance
for
those
that
go
into
government
but
we
all
know
people
who
have
no
useful
skills
ith
the
death
of
the
children
everybody
is
getting
real
upset
what
about
the
other
plus
people
i
suppose
that
you
consider
children
to
be
property
of
the
state
with
the
family
as
custodians
in
the
states
its
the
other
way
around
children
are
parental
property
if
what
you
consider
a
corrupt
government
demands
that
you
send
you
children
into
their
tender
care
i
suppose
that
you
will
obey
the
state
and
turn
you
children
over
to
their
care
sorry
i
am
not
as
enamoured
of
the
womb
to
tomb
cradle
that
is
ingsoc
got
ta
go
the
beach
is
calling
chus
pyotr
sometimes
pyotr
filipivich
sometimes
owl
april
you
realize
that
this
makes
twice
in
two
months
that
the
government
had
a
perfect
plan
that
went
awry
