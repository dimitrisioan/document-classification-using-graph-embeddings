hmmm
what
statistics
are
these
can
you
offer
any
references
the
only
studies
ive
seen
indicate
a
higher
proportion
of
homosexuals
in
prison
than
in
the
general
population
but
i
dont
think
that
allows
for
the
default
you
refer
to
prison
is
not
a
normal
situation
but
i
havent
seen
anything
that
suggests
that
the
default
proportion
is
lower
than
in
the
general
population
although
it
seems
plausible
anyway
as
i
say
can
you
provide
any
references
is
this
an
arguement
against
or
for
or
simply
a
statement
of
agreeance
disagreeance
the
fact
that
there
are
more
homosexuals
in
prison
does
not
mean
that
homosexuals
are
immoral
and
more
liable
to
commit
crime
and
one
must
remember
that
prison
is
not
necessarily
a
reflection
of
the
type
of
people
who
are
criminals
what
are
the
statistics
for
unsolved
crime
there
is
also
the
question
of
cause
and
effect
lock
a
mostly
straight
guy
up
for
years
with
only
guys
ask
ten
years
later
if
he
has
ever
had
sex
with
a
guy
closing
your
eyes
and
pretending
its
a
girl
sucking
you
still
counts
as
sex
with
a
guy
