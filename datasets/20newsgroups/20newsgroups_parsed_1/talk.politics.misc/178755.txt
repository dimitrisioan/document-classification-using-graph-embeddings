how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a
bunch
of
cops
putting
their
lives
on
the
line
day
in
and
day
out
who
are
afraid
as
hell
of
a
large
black
guy
that
took
a
large
amount
of
punishment
and
refused
submit
oh
yeah
did
you
watc
h
the
start
of
the
video
when
king
got
up
out
of
his
prone
postion
and
charge
the
cops
sorry
the
video
cuts
both
was
when
you
sit
and
watch
it
start
to
even
if
rodney
king
had
come
out
of
that
car
waving
a
gun

they
managed
to
disarm
him
the
police
still
had
no
right
right
to
beat
him
senseless
the
way
they
did
once
he
was
on
the
ground
if
they
cant
handle
their
jobs
they
should
be
relieved
of
them

police
did
not
beat
king

he
was
on
the
ground
they
beat
him
when
he
was
on
his
knees
trying
to
get
back
up

this
is

much
less

than
you
are
in
sadder

isnt
any
prettier
merely
because
