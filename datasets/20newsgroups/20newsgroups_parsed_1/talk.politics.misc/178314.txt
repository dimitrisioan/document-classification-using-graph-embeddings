april
press
briefing
by
george
stephanopoulos
the
briefing
room
pm
edt
mr
stephanopoulos
i
guess
im
just
prepared
to
take
questions
today
q
george
bob
dole
says
that
the
clinton
administrations
policy
on
bosnia
is
a
failure
and
that
he
wants
the
united
states
to
take
the
lead
in
lifting
the
arms
embargo
so
that
the
bosnian
muslims
can
defend
themselves
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
president
clinton
has
said
that
that
suggestion
is
under
active
consideration
obviously
this
is
a
tragic
situation
in
bosnia
and
if
the
bosnian
serbs
dont
come
to
the
negotiating
table
in
a
constructive
way
well
look
seriously
at
pressing
for
lifting
the
arms
embargo
in
the
meantime
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
a
tough
sanctions
resolution
in
the
un
were
going
to
continue
to
work
on
the
serbs
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
but
the
prospect
of
an
arms
embargo
is
something
the
president
certainly
will
consider
if
the
serbs
dont
come
to
the
table
q
how
much
longer
are
you
going
to
give
them
to
come
to
the
table
george
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
that
right
now
q
its
been
a
long
time
q
on
february
th
the
president
mentioned
the
value
added
tax
in
ohio
and
when
he
was
asked
about
it
later
by
reporters
he
said
quote
that
is
a
radical
change
in
the
tax
system
of
the
united
states
its
something
i
think
we
may
have
to
look
at
in
the
years
ahead
questioned
again
about
it
later
he
says
it
is
not
something
that
is
now
under
consideration
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
it
wasnt
a
trial
balloon
or
anything
he
said
i
was
just
discussing
the
tax
response
to
a
question
donna
shalala
quoted
in
usa
today
this
morning
quote
certainly
were
looking
at
a
vat
whats
gone
on
q
the
same
with
alice
rivlin
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
the
health
care
task
force
is
reviewing
a
number
of
options
they
havent
made
any
decisions
yet
and
as
i
have
said
from
this
podium
time
and
time
again
were
not
going
to
comment
on
decisions
that
havent
been
made
q
but
you
have
also
said
from
this
podium
time
and
time
again
q
wait
a
minute
whoa
nelly
whoa
q
that
that
was
not
under
consideration
q
yes
clinton
says
it
is
not
something
that
is
now
under
consideration
is
that
no
longer
true
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
the
working
group
as
ms
shalala
says
has
looked
at
this
prospect
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
of
any
kind
q
well
i
know
but
he
said
hed
tell
us
about
it
if
it
was
ever
under
consideration
i
take
it
that
now
he
is
and
he
didnt
tell
us
about
it
or
mr
stephanopoulos
did
he
say
if
it
was
under
consideration
or
if
it
was
something
to
be
proposed
q
if
we
start
considering
ill
tell
you
mr
stephanopoulos
if
its
something
to
be
proposed
q
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
thats
a
direct
quote
mr
stephanopoulos
the
task
force
has
looked
at
a
number
of
different
options
they
have
not
made
any
decisions
yet
the
president
has
not
made
any
decisions
yet
this
is
one
of
the
proposals
under
consideration
by
the
task
force
was
to
go
out
and
cast
as
wide
a
net
as
possible
for
different
ideas
on
how
to
reform
the
health
care
system
they
have
cast
a
very
wide
net
they
have
looked
at
hundreds
of
different
proposals
probably
thousands
of
different
proposals
but
the
president
has
not
made
any
decisions
q
well
is
the
president
aware
of
their
consideration
of
this
option
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
hes
been
briefed
on
any
preliminary
conclusions
or
anything
like
that
from
the
task
force
on
this
specific
proposal
of
any
kind
i
dont
know
that
thats
gotten
to
his
level
he
started
yesterday
to
go
through
with
the
task
force
a
very
wide
range
of
decisions
and
i
dont
believe
that
thats
been
presented
to
him
no
q
well
hes
not
relying
on
the
usa
today
to
tell
him
what
his
task
force
is
considering
in
the
way
of
taxes
mr
stephanopoulos
no
hes
going
through
it
in
a
very
deliberate
fashion
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
that
have
to
be
made
i
dont
know
that
this
proposal
has
reached
that
decision
making
point
q
if
this
is
still
under
consideration
thats
a
change
at
least
from
what
weve
been
told
by
dee
dee
i
think
about
three
weeks
ago
or
so
she
said
that
is
not
an
option
talking
about
the
had
a
big
argument
with
somebody
over
this
so
i
remember
it
specifically
and
said
it
not
once
but
twice
is
that
not
the
case
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
if
this
has
been
presented
to
the
president
as
something
that
is
being
looked
at
at
some
level
in
the
task
force
q
it
was
ruled
it
out
though
i
mean
unlike
other
options
that
youve
kept
in
the
mix
this
one
specifically
was
ruled
out
mr
stephanopoulos
again
this
is
something
that
is
being
looked
at
but
no
decision
has
been
made
of
any
kind
i
mean
it
doesnt
its
not
necessarily
material
until
you
get
to
the
decisionmaking
phase
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
hundreds
of
different
options
q
if
it
was
ruled
out
before
and
its
not
ruled
out
now
then
something
has
changed
george
yes
no
q
when
a
guy
says
in
february
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
the
widest
possible
range
of
options
q
so
somethings
changed
they
werent
looking
at
it
before
theyre
looking
at
it
now
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
if
the
working
groups
have
gotten
to
that
point
yet
they
are
casting
a
very
wide
net
q
how
was
it
possible
that
you
and
dee
dee
were
able
to
sell
definitively
rule
it
out
as
an
option
previously
and
now
are
saying
that
in
fact
it
is
being
considered
mr
stephanopoulos
again
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
a
wide
range
of
options
they
have
not
q
do
you
deny
that
you
and
dee
dee
ruled
it
flatly
ruled
it
out
on
several
occasions
in
the
past
month
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
deny
that
i
mean
those
are
the
presidents
words
those
are
very
clear
q
subsequent
to
the
presidents
words
do
you
deny
that
within
the
last
month
you
and
dee
dee
have
both
publicly
ruled
it
out
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
the
timing
i
think
what
we
did
was
refer
back
to
the
presidents
words
and
say
they
stand
q
so
dont
they
stand
any
longer
q
march
th
clinton
said
for
the
next
four
to
five
years
it
was
ruled
out
mr
stephanopoulos
well
those
words
the
president
did
say
that
in
february
the
working
groups
are
on
a
separate
track
and
as
i
said
i
dont
believe
q
separate
from
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
this
has
been
presented
to
the
president
q
are
they
considering
something
that
the
president
q
has
ruled
out
q
has
ruled
out
i
mean
will
the
president
consider
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulos
again
the
working
groups
have
not
presented
this
to
the
president
they
have
looked
at
a
wide
range
of
options
i
suppose
that
if
an
argument
is
made
he
will
clearly
listen
to
it
that
does
not
mean
he
has
decided
to
do
it
q
can
we
put
this
another
way
in
his
answer
in
ohio
he
looked
at
the
vat
in
terms
of
restructuring
the
whole
tax
system
under
those
that
was
the
circumstance
that
he
said
it
might
be
considered
at
some
future
point
is
that
no
longer
the
case
or
is
that
the
only
way
that
he
can
see
a
vat
emerging
mr
stephanopoulos
i
guess
im
not
sure
exactly
what
youre
asking
q
he
talked
about
the
vat
in
the
context
of
a
restructured
tax
system
not
as
a
specific
way
to
finance
health
care
for
example
q
or
anything
else
q
or
anything
else
q
it
was
always
in
the
context
of
substituting
for
other
taxes
at
a
time
of
a
dramatic
overhaul
of
the
whole
tax
system
mr
stephanopoulos
right
q
has
that
change
too
q
is
that
still
his
view
mr
stephanopoulos
i
havent
spoken
about
those
specific
comments
i
think
i
can
just
go
back
to
it
are
the
working
groups
have
they
examined
the
possibility
of
a
vat
yes
they
have
q
certainly
were
looking
at
a
vat
she
said
mr
stephanopoulos
they
have
examined
the
possibility
of
a
vat
has
it
been
presented
to
the
president
has
he
made
a
decision
no
he
has
not
q
what
kind
of
a
deal
do
you
have
when
youve
got
the
presidents
appointed
task
force
obviously
not
oblivious
to
his
ruling
something
out
except
in
the
context
of
some
huge
down
the
line
reform
goes
ahead
on
its
own
and
considers
a
tax
which
he
has
specifically
ruled
out
in
any
context
other
than
much
later
and
then
goes
ahead
and
announces
that
thats
what
theyre
looking
at
is
the
president
concerned
about
that
sort
of
thing
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
the
presidents
concern
is
to
make
sure
he
gets
the
best
health
care
proposal
possible
hes
concerned
with
making
sure
that
they
have
the
most
thorough
process
for
examining
all
the
possible
alternatives
all
the
different
alternatives
if
a
decision
is
made
to
go
forward
with
something
like
that
its
certainly
something
the
president
will
explain
and
justify
but
no
decision
has
been
made
along
those
lines
q
what
does
it
mean
exactly
though
when
the
president
rules
something
out
does
it
mean
it
can
get
back
on
the
table
later
if
a
more
persuasive
argument
is
made
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
just
thats
indisputably
true
if
you
but
at
the
same
time
he
has
not
ruled
it
in
he
has
not
made
a
proposal
q
what
makes
him
open
to
it
now
when
he
wasnt
open
to
it
before
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
certainly
willing
to
listen
to
the
argument
q
was
he
willing
to
listen
to
the
argument
for
a
shortterm
tax
this
year
and
he
wasnt
willing
to
listen
to
it
in
chilicothe
hes
now
open
to
it
mr
stephanopoulos
the
context
of
his
comments
was
that
it
was
not
something
he
wanted
to
be
clear
that
this
is
not
something
he
was
proposing
not
something
he
was
floating
q
not
something
he
was
considering
those
are
his
words
its
not
something
thats
now
under
consideration
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
youre
now
acknowledging
are
you
not
that
it
is
under
consideration
and
mr
stephanopoulos
im
acknowledging
that
the
task
force
has
studied
this
proposal
i
am
also
stating
that
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
on
it
q
but
the
door
is
open
for
the
president
to
reconsider
including
this
as
part
of
mr
stephanopoulos
obviously
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
again
but
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
q
do
you
know
if
they
will
make
a
presentation
on
behalf
of
the
vat
to
him
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
i
assume
that
if
i
dont
know
what
stage
they
are
it
in
proposing
i
dont
know
that
theyre
going
to
make
the
conclusion
that
this
is
something
they
should
present
to
him
i
know
this
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
q
do
you
understand
george
that
none
of
us
are
asking
these
questions
in
context
of
a
decision
that
the
president
has
made
only
about
what
the
president
is
considering
mr
stephanopoulos
i
understand
that
and
i
am
acknowledging
that
the
working
groups
have
examined
the
issue
of
a
vat
q
and
the
president
will
consider
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
assume
that
he
will
consider
the
argument
if
it
is
presented
to
him
q
does
that
mean
the
president
that
working
groups
think
that
when
the
president
says
no
he
means
maybe
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
means
that
the
working
groups
are
trying
to
do
the
most
thorough
job
possible
q
george
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
laughter
q
no
he
wants
us
to
stay
on
this
q
lets
do
gays
in
the
military
laughter
q
no
he
got
out
of
that
swamp
q
i
think
weve
gotten
the
bottom
line
on
that
vat
reggie
bartholomew
your
special
ambassador
in
belgrade
today
said
that
if
the
serbs
do
not
accept
the
agreement
that
has
been
worked
out
quote
we
will
do
our
part
to
pursue
the
lifting
of
the
arms
embargo
together
with
our
allies
that
seems
to
go
a
bit
further
than
what
youve
just
said
mr
stephanopoulos
sounds
almost
exactly
what
i
just
said
q
well
do
you
accept
in
other
words
you
accept
what
reggie
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
president
has
said
that
this
is
something
thats
under
consideration
it
is
something
he
will
consider
if
the
current
actions
dont
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
q
isnt
there
some
kind
of
timetable
here
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
there
is
a
timetable
theres
going
to
be
a
vote
on
the
un
resolution
in
about
days
q
thats
on
sanctions
thats
on
tightening
the
sanctions
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
right
thats
sanctions
and
we
believe
that
that
will
ratchet
up
the
pressure
and
we
hope
that
that
will
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
as
you
know
mr
bartholomew
also
met
with
mr
churkin
of
russia
and
they
are
also
working
on
ways
to
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
we
will
continue
to
pressure
them
in
many
different
ways
and
this
is
one
possible
option
as
well
q
the
question
is
whether
theres
a
timetable
for
consideration
or
a
vote
on
a
decision
on
lifting
the
arms
embargo
not
the
sanctions
mr
stephanopoulos
the
next
vote
in
the
un
is
on
sanctions
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
no
votes
scheduled
on
lifting
the
arms
embargo
but
it
is
something
that
we
have
discussed
both
internally
and
with
our
allies
q
why
did
reggie
bartholomew
tell
the
serbs
that
the
us
would
do
that
what
was
the
point
of
his
telling
them
that
mr
stephanopoulos
well
clearly
i
mean
this
is
something
thats
under
consideration
and
this
is
something
that
we
take
quite
seriously
if
they
do
not
come
to
the
table
they
should
know
the
consequences
of
failing
to
come
to
the
table
q
have
they
been
given
a
deadline
q
warren
christopher
has
been
saying
the
same
thing
and
it
hasnt
seemed
to
change
the
serbs
behavior
in
the
least
why
should
the
serbs
take
any
heed
of
a
threat
to
lift
the
arms
embargo
when
so
far
everything
thats
been
done
has
had
no
effect
on
the
fighting
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
accept
the
premise
of
your
question
it
has
had
an
effect
the
embargo
is
having
an
effect
q
what
effect
mr
stephanopoulos
if
the
serbians
choose
not
to
heed
our
warnings
then
they
will
face
the
consequences
q
what
effect
has
it
had
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
effect
that
it
has
had
on
the
serbians
it
has
tightened
up
they
are
not
getting
their
shipments
through
we
can
brief
more
fully
q
in
bosnia
george
in
bosnia
what
effect
has
it
had
mr
stephanopoulos
well
its
hard
to
say
if
its
stopped
the
aggression
to
date
that
is
why
were
continuing
to
press
for
the
serbians
to
stop
but
we
believe
that
over
time
we
will
continue
to
weaken
the
serbs
and
that
will
have
an
effect
im
not
saying
its
going
to
happen
overnight
it
clearly
hasnt
happened
overnight
but
we
believe
that
over
time
the
sanctions
can
weaken
the
serbs
if
it
fails
to
work
and
if
the
serbs
fail
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
well
move
forward
with
the
embargo
q
isnt
there
a
working
deadline
george
of
the
th
the
same
date
as
the
un
the
scheduled
un
vote
hasnt
the
united
states
said
along
with
many
of
the
other
nato
allies
that
if
the
serbs
arent
willing
to
sign
on
to
the
peace
accord
by
then
that
well
seek
havent
we
said
that
we
will
seek
mr
stephanopoulos
weve
said
continually
were
going
to
q
but
on
that
deadline
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
have
a
specific
date
but
were
going
to
move
forward
with
the
resolution
the
un
resolution
by
around
that
time
and
if
that
fails
to
take
effect
if
that
fails
to
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
we
will
clearly
consider
other
actions
q
isnt
this
awfully
incremental
mr
stephanopoulos
were
taking
a
stepbystep
approach
were
ratcheting
up
the
pressure
and
were
going
to
continue
to
do
that
q
is
there
a
possibility
george
that
by
the
time
all
these
incremental
steps
are
taken
the
serbs
will
have
achieved
their
goals
and
then
whats
the
purpose
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
get
the
serbs
to
stop
the
aggression
we
are
pursuing
that
goal
on
many
different
fronts
we
are
pursuing
it
through
the
un
were
pursuing
it
through
direct
talks
we
are
pursuing
it
through
tightening
the
sanctions
and
we
will
consider
lifting
the
arms
embargo
we
are
turning
the
screws
up
on
the
serbs
and
we
will
continue
to
do
that
q
but
if
the
efforts
have
been
unsuccessful
in
getting
the
serbs
to
stop
the
aggression
how
effective
will
any
campaign
be
to
have
the
serbs
give
back
what
theyve
gained
i
mean
once
theyre
entrenched
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
speculate
on
that
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
them
to
come
to
the
table
now
were
going
to
continue
to
find
ways
to
stop
the
aggression
but
i
cant
see
into
the
future
q
george
on
the
stimulus
package
house
republicans
say
theyre
going
to
hold
a
series
of
town
meetings
on
saturday
to
try
and
explain
the
details
of
your
package
they
cite
polls
which
show
that
the
more
people
learn
about
it
the
less
they
like
it
whats
your
strategy
to
counter
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
strategy
we
have
is
the
one
were
going
to
continue
as
you
saw
the
president
today
pointed
up
the
very
real
benefits
of
the
summer
jobs
program
that
this
package
will
provide
new
summer
jobs
this
summer
for
kids
in
inner
cities
and
suburbs
to
do
productive
work
we
are
also
going
to
point
out
the
benefits
of
the
highway
money
the
investments
in
highways
were
going
to
point
up
the
benefits
of
immunization
were
going
to
point
up
the
benefits
of
head
start
we
are
going
to
say
that
the
republicans
have
a
choice
they
can
take
action
to
create
jobs
or
they
can
perpetuate
the
gridlock
of
the
last
four
years
q
does
it
concern
you
though
that
the
house
now
the
house
republicans
are
after
you
as
well
as
the
senate
mr
stephanopoulos
the
house
republicans
voted
against
it
before
they
made
a
mistake
then
theyre
making
a
mistake
now
q
george
does
it
strike
anybody
in
the
administration
that
its
a
bit
strong
to
describe
as
the
president
did
this
morning
the
summer
jobs
program
as
quote
a
reaffirmation
of
a
promise
of
america
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
think
its
the
promise
of
america
to
give
kids
a
chance
to
reach
their
full
potential
q
governmentfunded
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
to
give
people
a
chance
to
work
absolutely
that
is
the
promise
of
america
q
i
want
to
follow
up
on
something
i
asked
yesterday
where
does
summer
jobs
where
does
that
figure
come
from
mr
stephanopoulos
that
is
on
top
of
i
did
look
at
it
there
are
currently
summer
jobs
in
the
pipeline
this
will
be
on
top
of
the
so
it
will
be
a
total
of
million
q
the
would
be
created
by
the
stimulus
package
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
where
does
that
number
come
from
because
weve
been
told
all
along
that
the
stimulus
package
would
create
new
jobs
and
according
to
panetta
that
breaks
down
to
something
like
fulltime
jobs
and
summer
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
but
the
summer
thats
when
you
do
their
fulltime
equivalence
i
mean
individuals
will
receive
jobs
this
summer
when
you
calculate
it
for
the
fulltime
job
effect
you
have
to
do
i
dont
know
what
the
exact
formula
is
q
seven
hundred
thousand
parttime
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
or
q
one
to
four
because
its
three
months
mr
stephanopoulos
thank
you
q
can
i
follow
up
on
that
did
the
president
misspeak
this
morning
when
he
said
that
some
of
the
government
money
for
these
summer
jobs
will
pay
for
private
for
kids
to
work
in
the
private
sector
mr
stephanopoulos
not
necessarily
i
mean
i
think
that
there
will
be
grants
available
thats
one
of
the
ways
that
you
pay
for
the
jobs
at
the
same
time
hes
also
issued
a
challenge
to
the
private
sector
to
hire
kids
on
their
own
as
well
q
tax
dollars
for
instance
would
pay
for
kids
to
work
at
timewarner
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
timewarner
is
actually
somebody
coming
forward
and
actually
doing
a
grant
thats
going
to
be
the
bulk
of
it
there
could
be
isolated
instances
though
where
there
would
be
grants
to
businesses
q
has
the
president
spoken
with
any
senate
republicans
this
week
mr
stephanopoulos
no
but
theres
been
a
lot
of
contact
with
senate
republicans
in
the
white
house
q
at
a
lower
level
but
the
president
hasnt
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
not
no
q
getting
any
closer
to
get
the
votes
mr
stephanopoulos
were
continuing
to
work
on
it
q
anybody
leaning
your
way
q
on
haiti
the
new
york
times
seems
to
be
reporting
something
of
a
breakthrough
in
aristides
attitude
towards
the
coup
leaders
can
you
confirm
that
there
has
been
this
change
and
what
impact
will
it
have
on
the
process
and
what
did
pezzullo
have
to
say
yesterday
in
his
report
mr
stephanopoulos
pezzullo
did
brief
the
principals
i
cant
confirm
whats
actually
happening
in
the
talks
i
would
leave
that
to
the
negotiators
themselves
but
mr
caputo
has
returned
to
haiti
we
have
received
a
briefing
here
at
the
white
house
from
ambassador
pezzullo
and
as
we
have
said
time
and
time
again
we
believe
that
assurances
of
security
are
important
to
a
final
resolution
to
a
broader
political
settlement
q
george
yesterday
you
offered
some
selective
breakdowns
of
how
the
stimulus
would
impact
some
states
and
cities
can
we
get
a
complete
breakdown
by
state
of
how
these
jobs
would
be
impacted
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
we
have
it
for
most
states
yes
and
i
think
we
can
get
it
out
q
could
you
make
that
generally
available
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
we
can
q
and
could
you
do
it
by
the
component
of
the
stimulus
in
other
words
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
we
can
do
i
know
that
we
can
do
it
by
summer
jobs
and
other
jobs
i
dont
know
how
deeply
it
can
be
broken
down
but
clearly
we
can
break
it
down
into
summer
jobs
and
other
jobs
q
and
can
i
follow
up
is
this
the
information
that
jeff
eller
and
the
rest
of
the
white
house
is
using
in
the
ads
in
the
states
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyre
ads
but
theyre
press
releases
q
can
you
describe
what
those
press
releases
contain
mr
stephanopoulos
all
were
doing
is
pointing
out
the
benefits
of
this
package
to
various
states
for
instance
i
know
that
today
senator
dole
is
heading
up
to
vermont
and
new
hampshire
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
stimulus
package
the
jobs
package
creates
jobs
in
vermont
it
creates
jobs
in
new
hampshire
and
the
people
of
those
states
should
remind
him
that
this
is
important
q
where
are
the
releases
going
mr
stephanopoulos
they
go
to
the
states
q
to
whom
mr
stephanopoulos
we
can
get
them
its
no
problem
q
can
we
get
it
q
why
dont
you
put
them
out
here
as
well
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
we
can
q
this
afternoon
would
that
be
possible
mr
stephanopoulos
ill
have
to
check
i
dont
know
but
as
soon
as
we
can
q
are
you
focusing
these
press
releases
on
states
where
there
are
moderate
or
pragmatic
republican
senators
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
were
trying
to
get
as
many
as
we
can
its
actually
quite
difficult
to
pull
this
together
and
were
doing
our
best
were
putting
them
out
as
we
get
them
q
why
are
you
so
closely
tracking
senator
doles
schedule
mr
stephanopoulos
i
was
just
following
it
q
are
press
releases
going
along
to
states
where
hes
visiting
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
i
think
that
probably
there
are
press
releases
going
to
vermont
laughter
q
will
there
be
a
man
in
a
chicken
suit
waiting
laughter
q
george
as
the
president
goes
about
the
business
of
defending
whats
in
his
stimulus
package
he
doesnt
address
what
seems
to
be
the
republicans
main
point
that
youre
funding
it
with
deficit
spending
rather
than
if
its
so
important
why
not
come
up
with
the
funding
for
it
seems
to
be
the
republican
argument
and
how
do
you
answer
that
mr
stephanopoulos
what
was
answer
is
we
are
paying
for
it
over
time
and
if
you
look
at
our
budget
we
pay
for
this
package
over
time
we
believe
right
now
the
economy
needs
a
jump
start
for
jobs
q
youre
not
claiming
are
you
that
that
doesnt
add
to
the
deficit
this
year
mr
stephanopoulos
im
saying
were
paying
for
it
over
time
i
didnt
say
that
q
i
know
that
george
but
i
mean
from
the
beginning
the
question
we
do
have
annual
budgets
and
things
deficit
spending
will
pay
for
that
this
year
will
it
not
mr
stephanopoulos
this
year
they
clearly
will
but
over
time
our
budget
fully
pays
for
this
program
q
what
youre
saying
is
that
there
are
savings
that
would
cover
this
if
it
were
this
year
in
future
years
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
thats
exactly
what
i
said
q
i
know
that
but
there
is
going
to
be
outstanding
debt
it
will
add
to
the
national
debt
from
this
year
mr
stephanopoulos
no
were
reducing
the
deficit
by
billion
billion
over
the
next
four
years
q
you
mean
youre
reducing
it
below
what
it
would
have
been
mr
stephanopoulos
exactly
q
in
fact
youre
adding
a
very
large
amount
to
the
national
debt
over
the
period
of
mr
stephanopoulos
but
were
reducing
it
far
more
from
what
it
would
have
been
thats
true
q
washingtontype
reduction
laughter
q
youre
getting
to
be
a
grumpy
old
man
q
george
has
any
decision
been
made
about
the
white
house
or
the
presidents
participation
in
the
gay
rights
march
coming
up
in
a
week
and
a
half
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
the
presidents
schedule
now
i
believe
hes
going
to
be
at
the
senate
democratic
retreat
in
jamestown
that
weekend
q
will
he
address
it
by
phone
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
that
its
a
little
far
out
but
i
believe
hes
going
to
be
in
the
senate
retreat
q
so
will
he
have
the
leaders
in
a
day
or
two
before
the
speech
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
i
would
expect
that
at
some
point
he
would
meet
with
the
leaders
of
some
of
these
groups
i
dont
know
the
schedule
on
it
though
q
will
there
be
an
aids
czar
appointed
prior
to
or
in
conjunction
with
the
event
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
april
nd
is
earth
day
what
is
the
president
going
to
do
to
mark
that
and
is
it
the
case
that
he
is
going
to
sign
the
biodiversity
treaty
that
day
mr
stephanopoulos
i
know
theres
been
some
work
on
the
biodiversity
treaty
i
dont
know
about
signing
it
that
day
but
i
would
expect
hell
have
a
statement
on
earth
day
or
right
around
then
q
where
is
the
work
on
the
biodiversity
treaty
mr
stephanopoulos
id
have
to
check
with
katie
mcginty
i
just
know
that
theres
been
some
work
done
but
i
dont
know
exactly
what
q
when
is
earth
day
mr
stephanopoulos
the
nd
i
think
q
why
is
it
you
know
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
statement
on
earth
day
but
you
dont
know
if
hes
going
to
have
a
statement
on
the
gay
rights
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
said
i
dont
know
if
hes
going
to
meet
or
when
hes
going
to
meet
q
do
you
have
a
statement
on
the
gay
rights
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
actually
no
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
he
did
though
q
do
you
have
some
details
on
the
miyazawa
visit
mr
stephanopoulos
its
a
working
visit
on
friday
and
the
president
is
looking
forward
to
that
in
discussing
a
number
of
issues
including
russian
aid
and
the
japanese
stimulus
package
and
the
trade
issues
between
the
two
countries
q
there
was
some
expectations
that
a
second
aid
package
to
russia
was
going
to
be
unveiled
at
the
g
meeting
and
if
i
understand
it
hasnt
happened
why
is
that
or
whats
the
status
on
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
g
meeting
is
still
going
on
and
as
you
know
secretaries
bentsen
and
christopher
have
talked
about
the
outlines
of
a
possible
package
but
were
going
to
continue
to
consult
with
congress
and
our
g
allies
on
that
q
we
will
not
then
make
any
kind
of
announcement
during
the
twoday
meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
the
meetings
not
over
yet
q
is
that
when
youre
going
to
make
one
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
ruling
out
the
possibility
q
the
presidents
going
to
announce
it
tomorrow
q
bentsen
said
that
q
yes
bentsen
said
it
would
be
tomorrow
q
so
did
christopher
mr
stephanopoulos
id
have
to
look
at
that
but
i
believe
it
is
more
likely
that
the
announcement
will
come
out
of
tokyo
q
george
has
there
been
further
consideration
here
about
going
to
sending
the
president
out
to
los
angeles
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
theres
its
not
something
weve
ruled
out
we
dont
have
a
date
set
for
it
q
george
you
all
have
a
position
or
do
you
support
immigrations
plan
to
settle
iraqi
prisoners
in
the
united
states
mr
stephanopoulos
its
the
first
ive
heard
of
it
q
george
there
was
a
report
today
about
the
q
fortunately
laughter
q
about
the
pace
of
appointments
and
says
that
president
clinton
is
behind
president
bush
in
the
number
of
positions
that
people
have
been
nominated
for
are
you
going
to
speed
up
the
pace
of
nominations
or
where
do
you
stand
with
it
mr
stephanopoulos
we
filled
of
the
presidents
appointments
and
its
broken
down
we
have
schedule
c
noncareer
ses
pas
fulltime
im
not
sure
what
that
means
laughter
pa
fulltime
and
this
is
about
the
same
its
about
the
same
pace
of
president
bush
obviously
as
you
move
along
farther
once
you
each
level
of
appointment
actually
has
a
multiplier
effect
and
frees
up
far
more
appointments
so
we
expect
the
process
to
speed
up
but
were
at
the
pace
of
bush
obviously
wed
like
to
get
these
done
as
quickly
as
possible
i
would
point
out
that
the
fbi
background
checks
and
the
background
check
is
far
more
comprehensive
and
it
takes
more
time
than
our
predecessors
and
that
is
part
of
the
holdup
but
were
working
on
it
q
is
that
because
of
nannygate
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
an
awful
big
part
of
it
yes
q
in
the
story
this
morning
you
were
at
approximately
the
same
pace
as
bush
in
making
appointments
but
way
behind
in
winning
confirmations
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
where
the
background
checks
comes
into
play
thats
the
problem
q
thats
the
background
checks
problem
because
i
mean
you
have
a
democratic
senate
mr
stephanopoulos
no
thats
not
the
you
make
the
appointments
and
then
it
takes
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
fill
out
all
the
forms
and
have
the
background
checks
done
thats
exactly
where
the
problem
is
q
whats
the
president

this
afternoon

whats
on
the
plan
for
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
got
some
meetings
just
office

this
afternoon
for
the
most
part
on
a
variety
of
issues
that
probably
a
halfdozen
different
issues
and
then
hell
be
tomorrow
well
have
an
event
probably
again
focused
on
the
stimulus
and
jobs
package
out
of
here
at
the
white
house
and
friday
is
the
miyazawa

tax
return

be
a
prebriefing
