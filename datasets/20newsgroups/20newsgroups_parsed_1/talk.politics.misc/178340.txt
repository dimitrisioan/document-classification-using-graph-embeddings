writes
as
noted
in
another
thread
limiting
govt
the
problem
libertarians
face
is
insuring
that
the
limited
government
they
seek
does
not
become
the
tool
of
private
interests
to
pursue
their
own
agenda
believe
it
or
not
we
liberals
are
frequently
as
opposed
to
anticompetitive
measures
as
you
conservatives
we
dont
believe
however
that
competition
will
necessarily
be
protected
by
the
actions
of
business
interests
in
a
freemarket
after
all
in
the
example
you
cite
it
was
not
liberals
that
pressed
for
such
regulations
but
good
staunch
conservative
businessmen
as
adam
smith
so
eloquently
demonstrated
the
freemarket
is
not
something
that
capitalists
seek
to
protect
when
they
can
profit
from
its
elimination
the
same
point
was
made
by
marx
a
point
of
agreement
between
the
two
theorists
that
should
tell
us
something
i
do
not
want
the
government
to
become
a
tool
of
private
interests
limited
government
can
not
insure
that
private
interests
will
not
use
this
government
for
their
own
agenda
agreed
but
this
is
not
a
failure
of
libertarianism
it
is
the
fact
that
utopia
is
not
an
option
there
is
no
single
system
where
everything
is
perfect
it
is
a
failure
of
libertarianism
if
the
ideology
does
not
provide
any
reasonable
way
to
restrain
such
actions
other
than
utopian
dreams
just
as
marxism
fails
to
specify
how
pure
communism
is
to
be
achieved
and
the
state
is
to
wither
away
libertarians
frequently
fail
to
show
how
weakening
the
power
of
the
state
will
result
in
improvement
in
the
human
condition
so
it
is
wise
to
look
for
the
best
solution
if
you
compare
countries
to
see
which
ones
people
would
rather
live
in
which
ones
have
less
starvation
hunger
poverty
and
misery
you
will
find
that
they
have
a
more
limitted
government
than
countries
with
alot
of
poverty
misery
and
suffering
no
limitted
government
can
not
insure
anything
but
it
sure
is
better
than
the
alternative
big
government
this
is
a
strawman
argument
and
fails
on
several
grounds
in
this
case
limited
and
big
government
are
not
defined
i
would
point
out
that
lebanon
somalia
and
the
former
yugoslavia
are
by
some
definitions
nations
with
limited
government
while
the
us
canada
and
nations
in
western
europe
where
people
would
rather
live
are
often
pointed
out
as
nations
with
big
government
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limited
government
and
those
who
want
unlimited
government
it
is
between
those
who
believe
government
regulation
in
a
capitalist
economy
serves
worthwhile
ends
and
those
who
believe
such
regulation
is
neither
desirable
on
empirical
grounds
nor
justifiable
on
ideological
grounds
