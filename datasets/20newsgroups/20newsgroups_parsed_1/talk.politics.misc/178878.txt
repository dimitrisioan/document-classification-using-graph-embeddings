male

gay
activity
low
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
the
politicians
will
have
plenty
to
be
scared
of
in
one
week
be
it
or
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
million
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
million
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
but
many
of
the
people
who
will
be
marching
arent
homosexuals
but
other
members
of
the
leftist
agenda
im
sure
there
will
be
a
few
non
queers
but
the
vast
majority
are
queer
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
you
say
there
will
be
million
queers
in
the
march
on
washington
the
largest
figure
ive
seen
in
the
press
is
million
and
we
all
know
how
liberal
the
press
is
with
their
numbers
for
another
thing
of
million
is
million
not
maybe
thats
where
you
got
the
million
number
also
the
number
cited
in
the
actual
report
is
so
that
would
be
about
million
as
for
this
march
on
washington
i
wonder
how
much
the
media
is
going
to
inflate
the
numbers
this
time
last
time
for
the
proabortion
rally
they
more
than
doubled
the
actual
number
of
people
who
showed
up
that
and
all
the
stories
coming
out
of
how
the
press
slants
the
news
really
makes
one
wonder
whos
watching
the
watchers
bcnu
jon
schell
life
is
something
to
do
when
you
cant
the
master
get
to
sleep
fran
lebowitz
anything
that
is
good
and
useful
is
made
of
chocolate
fortune
reboot
to
the
head
me
no
one
else
would
be
crazy
enough
to
claim
these
opinions
