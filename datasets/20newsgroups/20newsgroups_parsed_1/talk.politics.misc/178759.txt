dont
forget
about
the
culture
sadly
we
dont
as
a
society
look
upon
homosexuality
as
normal
and
as
we
are
all
too
well
aware
there
are
alot
of
people
who
condemn
it
as
a
result
the
gay
population
is
not
encouraged
to
develop
nonpromiscuous
relationships
in
fact
there
are
many
roadblocks
put
in
the
way
of
such
committed
relationships
it
is
as
if
the
heterosexual
such
as
not
being
able
to
get
married
isnt
a
roadblock
to
a
permanent
relationship
lack
of
a
marriage
certificate
doesnt
force
a
couple
to
break
up
this
is
an
excuse
used
by
homosexuals
because
the
alternative
is
to
ask
why
they
are
so
much
more
promiscuous
than
straights
