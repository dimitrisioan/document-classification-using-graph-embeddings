recent
studies
have
been
all
over
the
map
so
have
less
recent
studies
none
can
be
said
to
have
shown
anything
to
within
an
accuracy
of
of
as
you
claim
here
this
study
is
from
the
battelle
human
affairs
research
centers
in
seattle
and
was
a
hot
topic
in
the
news
last
week
the
study
questioned
at
random
men
in
a
face
to
face
interview
this
is
not
a
studies
but
a
study
other
studies
including
the
justpublished
janus
report
give
very
different
figures
the
janus
report
figures
are
not
too
different
than
kinsey
homosexual
men
and
bisexual
men
earlier
studies
have
been
all
over
the
map
also
i
think
hes
talking
about
kinsey
who
came
up
with
the
statistic
used
heavily
by
gay
groups
to
push
their
political
agenda
kinseys
work
has
often
been
accused
of
lacking
a
strong
scientific
backbone
dont
be
stupid
the
kinsey
report
is
one
study
so
it
cant
be
all
over
the
map
all
by
itself
other
studies
including
the
battelle
one
have
also
been
criticed
as
far
as
agendas
go
this
is
really
chutzpah
your
agenda
is
obvious
