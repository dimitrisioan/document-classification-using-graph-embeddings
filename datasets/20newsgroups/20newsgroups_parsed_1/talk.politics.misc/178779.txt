male

survey
gay
activity
low
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
the
figures
on
homosexuality
in
the
study
released
wednesday
by
the
alan
guttmacher
institute
are
significantly
lower
than
the
percent
figure
that
has
been
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
since
it
was
published
in
the
kinsey
report
so
what
homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in
child
molestation
put
up
or
shut
up
where
is
your
evidence
show
a
study
indicating
a
link
between
liking
grown
ups
of
the
same
sex
and
liking
children
saying
that
of
molested
children
are
male
shows
nothing
since
it
tells
you
nothing
of
the
molesters
preference
in
adults
if
they
have
any
at
all
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
the
politicians
will
have
plenty
to
be
scared
of
in
one
week
be
it
or
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
million
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
million
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
but
many
of
the
people
who
will
be
marching
arent
homosexuals
but
other
members
of
the
leftist
agenda
im
sure
there
will
be
a
few
non
queers
but
the
vast
majority
are
queer
join
the
pythagorean

of
your
evil
irrational
