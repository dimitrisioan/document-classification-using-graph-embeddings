drug
use
up
among
us
eighthgraders
by
mike
snider
p
d
a
new
national
survey
says
drugs
are
easier
to
get
more
teens
are
using
them
and
fewer
deem
drug
use
as
risky
for
the
last
two
years
government
officials
have
trumpeted
results
from
the
national
high
school
survey
as
signs
that
the
drug
war
is
being
won
but
this
year
officials
are
retreating
drug
use
by
eighthgraders
has
risen
according
to
the
survey
of
students
nationwide
possible
reason
for
the
increase
more
experimentation
why
if
drug
use
dropped
during
the
s
eventually
some
students
will
have
fewer
drugusing
contemporaries
who
act
as
examples
of
substance
abuses
drawbacks
says
social
psychologist
lloyd
johnston
one
of
the
survey
authors
each
new
wave
of
youths
must
be
given
the
knowledge
skills
and
motivation
to
resist
using
these
drugs
johnston
says
this
type
of
resurgence
is
possible
says
eileen
shiff
author
of
experts
advise
parents
delta
but
thats
not
the
issue
she
says
the
prevalence
of
alcohol
and
drugs
among
teens
today
could
result
in
more
alcoholic
adults
decades
from
now
aggravating
the
problem
baby
boomer
parents
who
experimented
with
drugs
and
alcohol
as
teens
trying
to
be
friends
not
parents
to
their
children
ive
even
seen
parents
serving
kegs
of
beer
to
their
underage
kids
and
friends
shiff
says
for
a
recent
graduation
shiff
and
other
parents
organized
an
allnight
lockin
party
where
no
booze
or
drugs
were
allowed
we
need
to
fulfill
that
parental
role
otherwise
the
peer
group
takes
over
she
says
officials
may
talk
about
the
war
on
drugs
but
they
really
havent
done
anything
that
ive
seen

todays
teen
panel
says
theres
always
going
to
be
experimentation
with
drugs
a
real
war
on
drugs
could
be
waged
educationwise
she
says
but
some
dont
want
to
give
kids
the
facts
they
think
it
will
give
them
ideas
its
the
same
with
birth
control
i
think
you
should
give
the
kids
the
information
or
have
it
accessible
through
classes
pamphlets
and
speakers
she
says
education
efforts
need
to
start
as
soon
as
kids
get
in
school
in
kindergarten

goodlooking
girls
in
the

they
take
a
hit
off
