does
the
greatly
increased
rates
of
incarceration
amongst
blacks
show
that
they
are
dysfunctional
or
that
the
majority
of
them
support
criminal
activity
isnt
this
a
matter
of
demographics
doesnt
this
simply
show
that
since
criminal
behaviour
is
common

apt

be
common
in
the

your

correct
numbers
here
year
old
range
and
since
the
percentage
of
blacks
in
this
range
is
higher
than
in
other
groups
then
it
follows
statistically
that
more
blacks
in
prison
is
an
expected
result
note
that
i
havent
said
anything
about
blacks
being
given
stiffer
or
longer
sentences
than
other
groups
im
sure
this
has
to
have
an
effect
on
the
issue
of
overrepresentation
of
blacks
in
prison
blacks
have
the
same
crime
report
rate
arrest
rate
and
incarceration
rate
for
violent
crimes
so
i
doubt
that
for
violent
crimes
that
there
is
any
inherent
bias
mechanism
present
there
is
a
wider
discrepancy
for
all
crimes
for
blacks
wrt
to
categories
interestingly
enough
the
discrepancy
is
the
largest
in
the
southern
united
states
where
blacks
are
incarcerated
well
below
the
average
in
the
rest
of
the
united
states
which
points
to
an
antibiasagainst
wrt
blacks
in
any
case
for
violent
crimes
and
burglary
and
drug
selling
blacks
are
reported
arrested
and
are
present
in
jailsprisons
considering
that
of
the
population
is
black
are
black
males
and
some
percentage
of
that
is
out
of
the
highlow
age
groups
we
do
have
a
situation
where
if
i
remember
my
old
calculations
right
of
the
population
commits
almost
half
of
the
really
nasty
crimes
blacks
with
similar
histories
crime
to
whites
get
the
same
sentences
except
in
the
south
where
they
receive
around
less
on
paper
there
are
actually
people
that
still
believe
love
canal
was
some
kind
of
environmental
disaster
weird
eh
these
opinions
are
mine
and
you
cant
have

ill
