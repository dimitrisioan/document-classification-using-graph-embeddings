the
official
and
legal
term
for
rape
is
the
crime
of
forcing
a
female
to
submit
to
sexual
intercourse
please
supply
me
with
some
references
i
was
not
aware
that
all
states
had
the
word
female
in
the
rape
statutes
i
am
sure
others
are
surprised
as
well
i
know
thats
how
it
works
in
practice
nicenfair
not
but
was
unaware
that
it
was
in
the
statutes
as
applying
to
females
only
uniformly
throughout
the
us
i
agree
mostly
with
chris
it
is
unfortunately
imo
true
that
the
fbi
figures
for
rape
based
on
the
uniform
crime
report
report
only
female
rapes
however
some
states
such
as
illinois
are
not
tabluated
because
they
refuse
to
comply
with
this
sexist
definition

post
to

from
your
account
insofar
as
several
liberal
jurisdictions
are
concerned
the
essential
elements
of
rape
are
gender
neutral
nonetheless
i
decided
to
provide
a
number
of
references
to
support
my
original
argument
blacks
law
dictionary
every
law
studentlawyers
friend
defines
rape
as
unlawful
sexual
intercourse
with
a
female
without
her
consent
the
unlawful
knowledge
of
a
woman
by
a
man
forcibly
and
against
her
will
the
model
penal
code
the
statute
proposed
by
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
of
uniform
state
laws
or
other
organization
for
adoption
by
state
legislatures
defines
rape
as
a
male
who
has
sexual
intercourse
with
a
female
not
his
wife
is
guilty
of
rape
if
he
a
compels
her
to
submit
by
force
or
by
threat
of
