my
friend
after
the
election
brought
up
the
point
that
it
would
enable
more
people
to
vote
however
since
it
makes
it
easier
to
get
to
the
place
of
registration
he
brought
up
the
analogy
that
if
there
were
only
one
place
to
vote
say
in
alaska
would
it
be
excessive
and
wasteful
to
petition
to
have
more
places
to
vote
this
is
a
similar
idea
a
way
to
encourage
more
people
to
vote
by
making
it
more
easily
accessible
i
not
knowing
where
i
stood
played
devils
advocate
and
said
well
would
you
have
the
taxpayers
money
go
to
busing
for
those
people
that
have
trouble
making
it
to
dmv
then
where
does
the
right
to
vote
merge
with
the
right
to
vote
easily
where
should
we
draw
the
lines
well
there
does
have
to
be
a
line
and
to
be
honest
extending
voter
registration
to
dmvs
is
hardly
analogous
to
having
only
one
place
for
registration
in
alaska
and
opening
a
new
one
in
atlanta
more
is
not
always
better
once
youve
passed
a
certain
point
my
friend
said
that
that
is
obviously
an
extreme
and
that
actually
the
motorvoter
bill
would
save
money
because
no
longer
would
the
city
have
to
pay
someone
to
sit
in
the
town
hall
and
spend
all
hisher
time
filing
those
things
theyd
just
be
at
the
push
of
a
button
or
the
filling
out
of
an
x
at
dmv
so
i
actually
someone
else
but
theres
no
need
to
confuse
this
anymore
countered
again
saying
that
wouldnt
congress
as
always
get
exorbitent
budgets
and
fund
committees
to
orchestrate
and
oversee
the
implementation
the
argument
went
back
and
forth
forever
ranging
from
whether
or
not
its
better
to
have
more
people
voting
whether
that
is
even
relevant
etc
just
looking
for
some
more
opinions
anybody
got
em
i
thought
the
motor
voter
bill
passed
in
any
case
my
experiance
with
tennessees
voter
registration
system
which
you
can
register
with
by
mail
by
the
way
is
that
nobody
who
is
interested
in
voting
is
being
denied
access
to
registration
all
it
requires
is
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
interest
on
the
registrants
part
and
thinking
about
the
election
once
in
the
eleven
months
prior
to
it
once
you
register
its
good
unless
you
miss
for
years
worth
of
elections
of
move
its
easy
to
register
now
i
simply
dont
see
the
value
in
going
out
and
trying
to
get
people
registered
who
dont
have
enough
gumption
to
even
write
and
have
the
proper
forms
sent
to
them
how
can
we
expect
responsible
decisions
out
of
these
people
