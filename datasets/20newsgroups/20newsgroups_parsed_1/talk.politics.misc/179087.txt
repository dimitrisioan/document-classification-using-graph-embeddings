it
is
interesting
sometimes
to
listen
to
us
news
as
seen
through
the
eyes
of
another
country
bbc
world
news
service
on
shortwave
originating
out
of
london
reports
that
a
survivor
of
the
waco
massacre
states
that
a
tank
when
making
a
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
building
knocked
over
a
kerosene
lamp
and
that
is
how
the
fire
started
attempts
were
made
by
the
people
inside
to
put
out
the
fire
but
it
spread
too
quickly
has
anyone
in
us
heard
anything
similar
or
are
us
government
spindoctors
censoring
such
information
it
was
on
cbs
yesterday
the
explanation
is
reasonable
enough
then
again
if
the
fire
was
accidental
why
didnt
more
people
get
out
the
bbc
news
is
also
reporting
that
about
of
those
that
died
were
british
citizens
thats
true
i
think
there
were
several
australians
in
the
group
as
well
