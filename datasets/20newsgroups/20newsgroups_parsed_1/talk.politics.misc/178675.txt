i
dont
remember
the
article
that
you
removed
so
i
cant
comment
on
it
what
i
can
comment
on
though
is
your
response
do
you
really
believe
that
what
you
wrote
is
sufficient
to
refute
the
article
do
have
any
facts
in
addition
to
your
opinion
no
one
has
time
to
chase
down
every
rumor
that
gets
printed
in
the
national
enquirer
or
whatever
the
point
is
to
wait
and
see
if
the
assertions
of
the
rather
bizarre
original
post
will
be
corroborated
in
any
way
perhaps
they
will
the
recent
posts
of
the
rather
bizarre
original
poster
speak
for
themselves
