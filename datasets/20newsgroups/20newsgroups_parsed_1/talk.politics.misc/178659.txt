well
the
obvious
point
to
make
is
would
straight
men
fuck
like
rabbits
if
the
oppertunity
presented
itself
i
reckon
any
man
would
go
wildly
promiscuous
if
presented
with
a
huge
variety
of
willing
partners
the
question
here
is
not
of
being
that
i
suppose
says
a
lot
about
how
screwed
up
you
are
no
cramer
it
does
not
in
this
instance
you
are
telling
porkies
to
yourself
as
well
as
everyone
else
havent
you
ever
been
to
a
cafe
or
restaurant
and
been
absalutely
stuffed
full
of
goodies
and
yet
when
one
more
item
just
a
little
different
with
a
new
texture
and
a
new
taste
was
presented
you
somehow
found
the
space
for
it
maybe
you
havent
so
what
it
is
a
widely
reported
phenomina
and
i
reckon
the
same
applies
to
sex
