namblas
presence
in
the
sf
gay
pride
parade
says
quite
a
bit
it
says
that
either
the
parade
organizers
want
to
show
support
for
nambla
or
they
themselves
have
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
their
rights
and
responsibilities
i
would
really
really
like
to
believe
the
latter
but
i
would
need
some
help
to
do
so
there
are
dozens
of
examples
of
the
latter
nambla
is
an
especially
glaring
one
but
hardly
the
only
one
perhaps
though
the
exclusion
of
the
gay
perotistas
in
the
sf
gay
pride
parade
would
make
me
think
that
they
had
some
clue
in
this
regard
dozens
of
examples
