the
filibuster
does
not
make
sense
because
the
senate
is
elected
as
a
last
gasp
assembly
it
is
designed
to
be
the
repository
of
doddery
old
men
with
no
power
phill
i
dont
know
which
senate
youre
discussing
but
it
aint
ours
phill
probably
thinks
that
the
us
senate
is
supposed
to
be
the
equivalent
to
the
uks
house
of
lords
the
status
of
the
house
of
lords
today
is
quite
different
to
its
status
in
which
just
goes
to
show
that
where
the
us
is
concerned
phill
still
has
no
idea
what
he
is
talking
about
maddison
and
hamilton
were
both
studying
existing
forms
of
government
for
several
years
before
they
wrote
the
federalist
papers
that
the
us
system
is
based
to
a
considerable
degree
on
the
uk
model
is
pretty
widely
accepted
at
the
time
there
was
no
other
major
country
with
a
representative
body
the
french
plebicite
had
been
suppressed
for
years
and
its
restoration
eight
years
later
would
mark
the
start
of
the
french
revolution
after
the
uk
system
the
major
influences
were
the
dutch
system
and
of
course
the
classical
systems
nobody
seriously
suggests
that
rome
or
greece
were
models
though
because
the
political
systems
of
both
countries
were
acknowleged
disasters
the
main
lesson
learnt
from
greece
was
that
unless
a
federal
state
was
constructed
a
war
would
be
inevitable
the
greek
democracies
were
always
fighting
amongst
themselves
which
is
how
rome
managed
to
invade
had
the
federal
consitution
been
rejected
the
new
roman
empire
in
the
shape
of
britain
would
quite
certainly
have
reabsorbed
much
of
the
colonies
in
due
course
moreover
the
states
would
have
been
at
each
others
throats
as
soon
as
the
louisiana
purchase
situation
arose
during
the
napoleonic
period
