writes
you
mean
since
your
philosophy
took
over
the
economy
has
almost
collapsed
excuse
me
my
philosophy
you
dont
have
any
idea
what
my
philosophy
is
the
american
economy
has
had
its
ups
and
downs
through
a
number
of
prevailing
economic
philosophies
but
then
economics
is
hardly
a
science
in
my
lifetime
your
philosophy
socialism
masquerading
as
a
liberal
welfare
state
has
been
in
ascendancy
yoearth
to
claytonmy
philosophy
i
have
never
discussed
this
with
you
i
know
its
a
minor
point
but
gee
dude
you
have
no
idea
what
economic
and
political
principles
i
adhere
to
but
dont
let
that
stop
youyoure
on
a
roll
just
ascribe
to
me
whatever
you
wanti
know
youll
choose
wisely
after
all
i
do
believe
in
personal
responsibility
no
i
mean
exactly
what
i
wrotethe
welfare
system
of
the
new
deal
is
wholly
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
current
state
of
affairs
absolutely
so
the
response
of
socialists
is
take
us
even
further
into
socialism
duh
what
else
would
you
expect
a
socialist
to
do
flashinthepan
no
your
subculture
has
utterly
dominated
the
tv
and
movie
industries
for
two
decades
now
my
subculture
my
were
getting
personal
the
only
subculture
i
see
dominating
the
tv
and
movie
industries
is
money
if
youll
buy
it
theyll
sell
it
and
as
recent
movements
to
boycott
tv
advertisers
have
shown
theyre
very
sensitive
about
what
sells
whatever
happened
to
personal
responsibility
anyway
or
am
i
personally
responsible
for
the
decline
in
that
too
to
the
extent
that
people
have
been
encouraged
to
not
be
responsible
for
themselves
yes
a
just
when
and
where
have
i
encouraged
people
not
to
be
responsible
for
themselves
be
specificbut
do
make
up
random
dates
and
heinous
acts
as
you
see
fit
b
you
and
i
have
encouraged
many
people
to
do
many
things
how
does
that
in
any
way
make
our
audiences
less
responsible
for
their
actions
is
there
a
finite
amount
of
responsibility
so
cf
conservation
of
energy
as
i
become
more
responsible
for
an
occurrence
by
encouraging
it
the
actual
perpetrator
becomes
correspondingly
less
so
at
what
point
does
the
perpetrator
become
completely
innocent
altogether
you
know
this
lends
a
whole
new
meaning
to
the
term
the
moral
high
ground
oddly
enough
all
the
unskilled
or
semiskilled
people
i
know
manage
to
find
employment
almost
immediately
maybe
she
needs
to
move
to
a
cheaper
part
of
the
country
where
jobs
are
plentiful
and
the
cost
of
living
is
lower
the
west
side
of
chicago
is
about
as
cheap
as
it
getssqualor
city
tell
me
about
all
these
places
where
its
cheap
to
live
and
jobs
are
abundantill
pass
them
on
sonoma
county
i
will
pass
the
info
on
out
of
curiosity
what
kind
of
jobs
would
these
be
whats
the
demographic
mix
wrt
race
age
culture
lots
of
employment
and
utterly
surrounded
by
socialists
well
i
suppose
thats
the
sort
of
environment
that
would
attract
socialists
or
at
least
not
dissuade
them
no
its
that
areas
with
a
lot
of
wealthy
breed
socialists
all
the
spoiled
rich
kids
feeling
guilty
about
their
wealth
but
not
guilty
enough
to
give
it
away
they
just
look
for
politicians
to
take
my
more
limited
wealth
away
lifes
a
bitch
aint
it
man
youve
got
to
get
out
of
fornicaliahave
you
considered
someplace
perhaps
geographically
distant
but
politically
more
friendly
to
you
like
say
indiana
or
maybe
utah
well
i
doubt
that
much
of
this
goes
to
drugsthere
isnt
much
left
after
buying
food
and
there
is
very
little
in
the
first
place
sure
you
read
about
such
cases
now
and
then
but
thats
what
makes
them
news
show
me
your
statistics
about
afdc
abuse
i
can
tell
you
that
relatives
i
have
known
the
drugs
came
first
the
food
was
secondary
i
dont
doubt
it
but
unless
you
can
show
me
statistics
to
the
contrary
i
will
persist
in
my
apparently
dogmatic
socialist
belief
hey
if
you
say
so
that
most
afdc
money
really
doesfor

worse
