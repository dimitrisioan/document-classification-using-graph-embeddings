new

i
find
it
very
interesting
that
you
say
there
will
be
million
queers
in
the
march
on
washington
the
largest
figure
ive
seen
in
the
press
is
million
and
we
all
know
how
liberal
the
press
is
with
their
numbers
for
another
thing
of
million
is
million
not
maybe
thats
where
you
got
the
million
number
also
the
number
cited
in
the
actual
report
is
so
that
would
be
about
million
as
for
this
march
on
washington
i
wonder
how
much
the
media
is
going
to
inflate
the
numbers
this
time
last
time
for
the
proabortion
rally
they
more
than
doubled
the
actual
number
of
people
who
showed
up
that
and
all
the
stories
coming
out
of
how
the
press
slants
the
news
really
makes
one
wonder
whos
watching
the
watchers
why
are
you
all
playing
these
pathetic
number
games
the
number
of
people
showing
up
at
the
mow
hardly
constitutes
the
entire
queer
populace
i
doubt
that
it
constitutes
more
than
a
handful
of
us
im
queer
and
i
wont
be
there
simply
because
i
dont
have
the
time
or
the
transportation
what
the
hell
makes
you
think
the
participants
in
the
mow
embody
more
than
a
minimum
number
face
it
people
were
everywhere
there
are
always
more
of
us
than
you
think
our
numbers
are
constantly
growing
not
diminishingsome
of
your
children
will
grow
up
to
join
us
hell
some
of
my
children
may
grow
up
to
join
us
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
phenomenon
is
not
to
fear
it
and
blind
yourself
to
it
but
to
realize
that
you
have
nothing
to
fear
were
not
perverts
were
not
dangerous
were
just
here
and
were
human
just
like
youer
most
of
you
idiots
like
cramer
and
kaldis
can
rant
all
they
like
it
wont
do
them
one
iota
of
good
drewcifer
ps
i
still
cant
get
over
the
fact
that
some
people
actually
believe
that
every
queer
in
the
us
would
show
up
at
the
mow
and
that
these
numbers
are
meaningful
and
come
to
think
of
it
what
about
those
of
us
in
other
countries
