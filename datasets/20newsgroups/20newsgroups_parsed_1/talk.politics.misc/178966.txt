we
are
not
winning
the
war
on
drugs
i
think
you
can
see
that
one
of
the
tactics
that
the
dea
employs
to
give
people
the
impression
that
the
war
on
drugs
is
being
won
is
to
selectively
quote
statistics
only
statistics
that
support
their
contention
that
drug
use
has
gone
down
the
excerpt
from
time
magazine
that
i
included
in
this
post
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
organizations
like
the
dea
attempt
to
deceive
the
public
unfortunately
theres
not
much
we
can
learn
from
the
statistics
presented
here
either
due
to
rounding
the
est
for
lsd
could
be
anywhere
from
to
and
the
est
could
be
anywhere
from
to
this
means
that
the
actual
change
if
you
believe
these
statistics
in
the
first
place
was
anywhere
from
to
similarly
the
increase
in
cocaine
use
could
be
anywhere
from
to
and
the
increase
of
crack
use
could
be
anywhere
from
to
this
doesnt
even
take
into
account
the
margin
of
error
which
isnt
provided
here
this
does
not
mean
that
the
rest
of
the
argument
you
present
is
unfounded
but
it
does
mean
that
usa
today
has
not
surprisingly
provided
us
with
virtually
no
information
