the
official
and
legal
term
for
rape
is
the
crime
of
forcing
a
female
to
submit
to
sexual
intercourse
please
supply
me
with
some
references
i
was
not
aware
that
all
states
had
the
word
female
in
the
rape
statutes
i
am
sure
others
are
surprised
as
well
i
know
thats
how
it
works
in
practice
nicenfair
not
but
was
unaware
that
it
was
in
the
statutes
as
applying
to
females
only
uniformly
throughout
the
us
chris
there
may
be
some
confusion
here
the
uniform
crime
reports
program
run
by
the
fbi
defines
rape
as
a
female
victim
only
crime
even
though
some
states
have
the
laws
desexed
i
suspect
that
this
causes
male
victims
of
rape
to
be
left
out
of
the
