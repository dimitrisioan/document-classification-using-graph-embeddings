once
pointed
out
that
curious
fact
well
since
tax
evasion
is
illegal
one
generally
would
not
bother
to
consider
whether
it
was
unpatriotic
or
not
how
often
does
one
think
of
murder
as
being
unpatriotic
perhaps
a
more
appropriate
question
would
be
why
is
tax
avoidance
not
considered
unpatriotic
the
answer
to
this
is
simple
tax
avoidance
is
simply
defined
as
paying
the
minimum
tax
you
are
legally
obligated
to
pay
there
is
a
deeper
reason
taxes
by
their
very
nature
are
unamerican
one
need
only
look
at
the
birth
and
history
of
the
us
to
see
this
fact
wasnt
the
beef
with
the
english
over
taxation
without
representation
not
taxation
itself
from
my
admittedly
dim
recollection
of
us
history
most
of
the
problems
we
americans
have
had
with
taxes
have
been
with
unfairunjust
taxation
schemes
not
with
taxes
themselves
its
pretty
hard
to
run
a
government
without
any
means
of
support

any

has
a
