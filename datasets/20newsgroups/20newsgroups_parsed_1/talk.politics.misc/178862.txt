actually
i
was
rather
surprised
to
see
an
article
on
this
subject
ie
the
new
inproved
survey
saying
that
roughly
of
men
are
gay
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times
recently
i
think
it
was
on
thurs
april
the
headline
was
something
to
the
effect
of
new
survey
finds
of
men
are
gay
does
anyone
else
see
the
difference
between
of
men
are
gay
and
of
men
surveyed
say
they
are
gay
does
the
ny
times
think
that
there
is
no
one
in
the
closet
i
see
when
survey
after
survey
show
we
are
supposed
to
believe
one
survey
done
with
very
poor
assumptions
with
a
very
atypical
population
years
ago
when
the
society
was
far
more
repressed
about
homosexuality
than
it
is
now
yeah
right
