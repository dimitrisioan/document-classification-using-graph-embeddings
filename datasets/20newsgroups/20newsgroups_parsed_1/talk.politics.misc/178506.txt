subject
who
are
the
rich
was
re
professors
whining
about
pay
candidate
clinton
promised
to
tax
the
rich
and
most
folks
thought
that
was
a
pretty
nifty
idea
then
president
clinton
said
he
wanted
families
who
make
more
than
to
bear
of
the
new
tax
burden
and
many
were
quick
to
complain
that
their
sixfigure
income
does
not
make
them
one
of
the
welltodo
its
particularly
ironic
to
me
that
its
in
those
traditionally
liberal
enclaves
of
the
bay
area
and
academia
where
the
wealthy
are
struggling
so
to
fit
themselves
into
the
mantle
of
just
regular
workingclass
folk
nobody
will
ever
admit
to
being
rich
everybodys
middle
class
so
who
are
the
rich
well
ill
throw
out
some
stats
from
the
census
and
let
you
be
the
judge

in
article
tim
fogarty
writes
that
would
be
about
to
thousand
us
and
that
is
what
tenured
professors
can
expect
to
make
for
a
phd
with
say
years
experience
is
a
lot
less
than
what
he
could
be
making
in
industry
oh
as
a
year
veteran
of
silicon
valley
ive
seen
precious
few
employment
ads
that
call
for
phds
and
k
is
hardly
chump
change
its
well
above
the
median
household
income
for
the
state
bay
area
average
household
income
is
in
the
mid
range
national
average
is
the
bay
area
has
nearly
twice
the
national
average
of
sixfigure
income
households
vs
the
costofliving
here
may
be
high
but
i
dont
think
its
twice
the
national
average
in
los
angeles
modest
home
prices
can
be
a
squarefoot
tract
house
in
a
bay
area
workingclass
neighborhood
goes
for
about
i
doubt
that
the
los
angeles
market
is
all
that
different
it
would
appear
that
this
definition
of
modest
is
perhaps
a
bit
immoderate
so
what
theyre
no
cheaper
for
those
who
are
gainfully
employed
in
california
is
not
uppermiddleclass
it
depends
upon
your
definition
its
clearly
above
average
it
is
more
than
what
twothirds
of
california
households
make
seems
to
me
that
belonging
to
the
upper
onethird
is
not
an
unreasonable
definition
of
uppermiddleclass
note
that
if
that
professors
spouse
earns
they
become
one
of
clintons
rich
families
heres
a
breakdown
of
national
california
and
bay
area
household
incomes
k
k
k
k
us
the
census
bureau
did
some
weird
ca
rounding
heremore
like
ba
and
to
add
a
little
prespective
a
minimum
wage
earner
working
hoursweek
makes
year
the
poverty
line
for
a
family
of
four
is
if
they
make
up
to
twice
that
the
government
considers
them
to
be
working
poor
say
we
decide
to
call
this
the
lowermiddleclass
then
how
bout
k
annual
income
is
middleclass
k
is
uppermiddleclass
k
is
rich
k
is
filthyrich
and
is
bill
gates
make
sense
timr
theres
nothing
surer
the
rich
get
rich
and
the
poor
get
poorer
in
the
meantime
in
between
time
aint
we
got
fun
