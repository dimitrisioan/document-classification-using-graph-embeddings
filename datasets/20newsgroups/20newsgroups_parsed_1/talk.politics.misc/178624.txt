the

was
dont
forget
that
had
or
more
partners
not
surprising
remember
that
study
includes
homosexuals
as
well
implying
no
so
tacitly
that
homosexual
men
are
more
promiscuous
than
heterosexual
men
interesting
especially
in
the
wake
of
a
news
report
last
week
about
a
group
of
high
school
seniors
heterosexual
i
might
add
who
boasted
monthly
conquests
of

to
girls
each
it
seems
that
promiscuity
is
not
limited
to
homosexuals
this
is
a
sad
fact
of
life
no
matter
what
you
look
for
whether
it
be
homosexual
promiscuity
racial
discrimination
or
sexual
harassment
you
will
find
it
whether
or
not
it
actually
exists
where
youre
looking
