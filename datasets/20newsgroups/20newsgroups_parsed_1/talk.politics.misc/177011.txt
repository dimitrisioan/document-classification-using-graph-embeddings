re
urgent
ted
frank
wanted
for
killing
aj
teel
if
the
heading
is
true
mr
frank
should
be
ashamed
of
himself
nothing
makes
me
gag
more
than
people
who
dont
respect
the
rights
of
others
to
voice
their
opinions
my
idol
lenny
bruce
once
commented
about
that
asshole
time
magazine
when
they
advocated
censorship
of
his
material
time
actually
sided
with
the
cops
and
their
arresting
of
bruce
at
his
shows
whereby
he
routinely
would
say
cocksucker
then
the
cops
would
rush
the
stage
to
arrest
him
my
how
the
times
havent
changed
i
cant
help
but
think
of
how
lenny
would
be
received
in
todays
politically
correct
arena
heck
i
even
support
the
right
of
neo
nazis
to
speak
their
opinions
and
march
down
the
streets
and
before
mr
frank
or
anyone
else
makes
any
wisecracks
about
antisemitismim
jewish
a
longtime
member
of
aipac
and
the
jnf
and
have
contributed
over
apiece
to
these
fine
groups
im
a
regular
contributor
to
every
proisrael
group
i
can
find
but
i
still
support
the
right
of
people
like
arf
to
speak
up
and
vomit
his
propaganda
i
want
to
know
just
who
these
people
are
im
basing
all
this
on
the
assumption
that
mr
frank
did
indeed
write
to
some
sysadmin
requesting
mr
teel
to
be
admonished
if
this
is
not
the
case
i
hereby
retract
these
nasties
directed
toward
him
if
not
i
stand
against
mr
frank
and
his
trashing
of
the
first
amendment
