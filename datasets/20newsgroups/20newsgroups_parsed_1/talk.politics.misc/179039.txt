i
cant
wait
for
the
investigation
considering
that
everyone
is
dead
now
and
the
place
is
burnt
to
the
ground
i
guess
honest
citizens
will
just
have
to
take
the
word
of
the
atf
about
how
much
of
a
threat
these
people
were
just
look
at
the
history
of
koresh
and
his
folowers
they
captured
the
mount
carmel
complex
a
few
yearss
ago
in
a
gun
battle
with
a
rival
bd
sect
leaving
more
than
one
person
dead
they
werent
exactly
the
most
peace
loving
bunch
i
wonder
where
you
have
been
getting
your
misinformation
from
straight
from
the
batf
itself
koresh
and
his
followers
did
not
capture
the
compound
a
few
years
ago
it
has
always
been
theirs
a
few
years
ago
their
was
an
argument
over
who
should
lead
the
group
a
gunfight
erupted
one
person
died
koresh
was
charged
with
the
murder
when
the
sheriff
came
to
arrest
him
the
sheriff
knocked
on
the
dorr
and
showed
koresh
the
warrant
a
tactic
that
the
batf
might
try
learning
koresh
and
the
others
charged
peacibly
surrendered
to
the
sherrif
a
trial
ensued
the
others
were
found
innocent
and
the
jury
hung
on
koreshs
charge
mob
rule
isnt
any
prettier
merely
because
the
mob
calls
itself
a
government
it
aint
charity
if
you
are
using
someone
elses
money
wilsons
theory
of
relativity
if
you
go
back
far
enough
were
all
related
