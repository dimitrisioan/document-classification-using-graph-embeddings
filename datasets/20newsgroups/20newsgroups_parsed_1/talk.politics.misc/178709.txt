a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
now
lets
take
a
quick
look
at
what
you
are
saying
the
median
of
a
distribution
is
that
variatevalue
which
divides
the
distribution
halfway
ie
of
the
distribution
population
have
lower
and
half
have
higher
variatevalues
so
for
males
the
median
this
means
that
half
of
these
men
are
higher
than
this
and
half
are
lower
than
this
now
if
the
population
sample
size
is
and
of
them
are
gay
males
are
gay
if
we
actually
were
either
exclusively
homosexual
or
bisexual
you
arent
readiing
very
carefully
say
they
are
distributed
equally
then
only
are
greater
than
sexual
partners
of
course
this
means
that
heterosexual
men
are
greater
than
interesting
