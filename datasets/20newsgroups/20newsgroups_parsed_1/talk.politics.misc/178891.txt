absolutely
nothing
seeing
as
there
is
no
table
for
heterosexuals
if
as
you
claim
the
supposedly
higher
promescuity
amongst
homosexual
males
makes
them
an
insurance
risk
you
need
to
be
show
that
heterosexual
males
are
less
promiscuous
than
homosexual
males
without
the
data
on
heterosexual
males
we
can
not
make
a
comparison
between
promiscuity
rates
of
heterosexuals
and
homosexuals
world
or
uk
well
the
obvious
point
to
make
is
would
straight
men
fuck
like
rabbits
if
the
oppertunity
presented
itself
i
reckon
any
man
would
go
wildly
promiscuous
if
presented
with
a
huge
variety
of
willing
partners

is
not
