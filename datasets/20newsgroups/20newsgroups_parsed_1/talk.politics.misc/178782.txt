subject
re
janet
and
the
babies
in
a
previous
article
not
a
boomer
says
evidently
it
was
janets
concern
for
the
babies
being
slapped
by
koresh
that
made
her
give
the
goahead
for
the
ramngas
tactics
larry
king
live
was
both
telling
and
sickening
every
other
word
out
of
janet
renos
mouth
was
the
little
children
etc
sounded
like
clinton
talking
she
made
claims
that
the
children
were
beaten
etc
despite
the
pronouncements
of
social
workers
that
none
of
the
children
who
left
the
compound
were
abused
but
the
real
crime
larry
king
and
his
censored
show
not
one
fucking
question
about
renos
possible
error
just
two
calls
about
how
she
had
made
a
good
decision
now
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
some
people
are
going
to
be
upset
nope
no
real
questions
at
all
