the

justice

writes
a
judge
denied
gms
new
trial
motion
even
though
gm
says
it
has
two
new
witnesses
that
said
the
occupant
of
the
truck
was
dead
from
the
impact
not
from
the
fire
thoughts
its
kind
of
scary
when
you
realize
that
judges
are
going
to
start
denying
new
trials
even
when
new
evidence
that
contradicts
the
facts
that
led
to
the
previous
ruling
appear
or
has
the
judge
decided
that
the
new
witnesses
are
not
to
be
believed
shouldnt
that
be
up
to
a
jury
and
what
about
members
of
the
previous
jury
parading
through
the
talk
shows
proclaiming
their
obvious
bias
against
gm
shouldnt
that
be
enough
for
a
judge
to
through
out
the
old
verdict
and
call
for
a
new
trial
whatever
happened
to
jurors
having
to
be
objective
first
people
should
be
aware
that
bretts
no
last
name
listed
posts
on
bitlistservpolitics
indicate
that
he
has
been
hostile
toward
gms
hiring
policies
and
to
the
moseley
verdict
when
it
came
out
equal
opportunity
disagreement
i
guess
my
guess
without
seeing
the
judges
opinion
is
that
gms
motion
was
denied
on
due
diligence
grounds
otherwise
a
party
to
a
case
could
always
keep
one
or
two
semicredible
witnesses
in
reserve
to
spring
if
they
lose
not
exactly
a
way
to
promote
repose

the

the
sly

the
blindly
naive

hopelessly
