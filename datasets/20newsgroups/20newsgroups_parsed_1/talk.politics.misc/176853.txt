re
winning
tax
case
daniel
r
reitman
attorney
to
be
writes
which
makes
it
legally
unsound
if
i
were
representing
mr
teel
id
try
a
procedural
approach
if
i
could
find
one
or
recommend
he
pleabargain
hes
setting
himself
up
to
be
in
hot
water
indeed
reading
the
cases
of
people
whove
tried
the
various
things
mr
teel
suggests
show
that
defendants
fall
into
two
classes
those
who
win
on
procedural
grounds
or
some
grounds
not
related
to
their
claim
and
those
who
lose
consider
newman
v
schiff
fd
th
cir
which
ive
seen
cited
by
tax
protestors
other
than
mr
teel
as
a
win
for
mr
schiff
mr
schiff
offered
on
tv
to
anyone
who
would
call
in
the
show
and
cite
any
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code
that
says
that
an
individual
has
to
file
a
return
mr
newman
took
him
up
on
it
mr
newman
had
seen
the
show
in
a
rebroadcast
the
next
morning
mr
schiff
claimed
that
the
offer
only
extended
to
people
who
actually
say
the
original
broadcast
and
so
there
was
no
offer
for
mr
newman
to
accept
and
so
no
unilateral
contract
was
formed
and
so
mr
schiff
did
not
have
to
pay
mr
schiff
was
correct
and
so
won
so
yes
mr
schiff
won
against
a
claim
on
the
reward
however
his
win
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
tax
code
