when
i
heard
the
latest
approval
rating
reported
for
clinton
i
laughed
so
hard
i
forgot
the
exact
numbers
maybe
one
of
the
clintonettes
can
refresh
my
memory
has
his
rating
dropped
to
or
percent
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
snick
oh
my
either
way
its
still
the
lowest
rating
any
president
has
ever
mustered
in
his
first
days
since
these
polls
started
being
taken
hum
i
guess
this
has
some
significance
as
opposed
to
having
an
incredible
drop
during
the
last
days
in
office
unfortuantely
having
a
loss
in
the
polls
during
the
last
days
of
office
usually
means
no
reelection
ask
george
he
was
finished
before
he
started
good
one
roooster
thats
hard
to
top
the
rooster
