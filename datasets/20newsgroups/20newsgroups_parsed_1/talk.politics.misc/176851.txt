if
homosexuals
did
keep
themselves
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
home
this
wouldnt
be
a
problem
however
there
are
various
cliques
sp
that
dont
they
want
to
present
the
argument
that
it
is
just
as
moral
and
right
as
heterosexuality
you
know
im
offended
by
newspapers
publicly
announcing
weddings
heterosexuals
should
keep
their
nutpials
out
of
the
public
eyes
they
should
be
banned
from
wearing
wedding
rings
from
having
legal
recognition
of
marriage
anything
thats
public
and
sexual
dont
mix
the
difference
of
course
is
that
we
are
right
and
you
are
wrong
if
you
are
a
minority
that
wants
freedom
it
helps
to
not
be
obnoxious
about
it
it
does
not
surprise
me
that
as
groups
like
translation
you
minorities
stay
in
predesignated
areas
we
the
majority
are
right
anything
you
do
is
wrong
since
might
makes
right
and
the
majority
always
rules
queer
nation
become
increasingly
belligerent
in
their
public
demonstrations
that
violence
against
homosexuals
rises
anything
that
reminds
the
crazies
who
like
to
beat
up
homosexuals
of
their
presence
is
going
to
aggravate
things
oh
crime
prevention
at
its
best
well
lets
extrapolate
this
maybe
if
you
didnt
display
all
of
your
private
property
then
those
nasty
theifs
wouldnt
go
after
it
and
dont
carry
any
money
that
way
those
muggers
wont
bother
you
and
you
still
dont
realize
that
either
way
it
is
says
that
homosexuals
are
very
dangerous
to
children
so
tell
mewhats
immoral
about
homosexuality
the
promiscuity
and
fetishism
that
characterizes
it
the
sexual
predatory
component
that
glorifies
the
pursuit
of
candyass
and
hairless
cocks
in
the
words
of
le
jojo
the
typical
homosexual
oh
i
did
not
know
that
le
jojo
is
a
typical
homosexual
stop
making
statements
about
something
you
know
nothing
about
that
is
gay
people
you
make
your
sweeping
generalizations
with
no
grounding
in
reality
what
i
hope
is
not
true
that
you
are
a
typical
heterosexual
anyone
want
to
comment
on
this
and
if
you
are
typical
then
i
can
start
extrapolating
a
lot
of
interesting
conjectures
about
heterosexuals
