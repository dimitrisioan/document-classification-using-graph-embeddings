re
the
state
of
justice
in
article
not
a
boomer
writes
a
judge
denied
gms
new
trial
motion
even
though
gm
says
it
has
two
new
witnesses
that
said
the
occupant
of
the
truck
was
dead
from
the
impact
not
from
the
fire
thoughts
its
kind
of
scary
when
you
realize
that
judges
are
going
to
start
denying
new
trials
even
when
new
evidence
that
contradicts
the
facts
that
led
to
the
previous
ruling
appear
welcome
to
the
conservative
judiciary
or
has
the
judge
decided
that
the
new
witnesses
are
not
to
be
believed
shouldnt
that
be
up
to
a
jury
i
think
scalias
point
was
that
you
get
one
chance
if
new
information
comes
out
later
tough
if
the
conviced
want
justice
they
have
to
hope
the
governor
is
feeling
charitable
theres
a
guy
on
death
row
in
texas
that
was
denied
a
new
trial
dispite
evidence
of
his
inocents
and
what
about
members
of
the
previous
jury
parading
through
the
talk
shows
proclaiming
their
obvious
bias
against
gm
shouldnt
that
be
enough
for
a
judge
to
through
out
the
old
verdict
and
call
for
a
new
trial
whatever
happened
to
jurors
having
to
be
objective
it
got
swept
away
in
the
reagan
revolution
