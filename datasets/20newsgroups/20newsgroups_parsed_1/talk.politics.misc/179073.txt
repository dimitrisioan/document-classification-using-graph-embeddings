press
briefing
by
george
stephanopoulos
the
briefing
room
pm
edt
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
president
is
going
to
come
out
at
pm
with
your
indulgence
i
think
what
wed
like
to
do
is
have
the
president
award
the
national
teachers
award
first
and
then
have
the
teacher
leave
or
whatever
and
then
hell
make
a
statement
on
waco
and
take
a
couple
questions
so
if
we
can
just
hold
off
going
live
and
all
that
until
thats
done
it
probably
will
work
out
a
lot
better
q
if
youll
give
us
the
time
thats
the
problem
q
weve
got
a
twominute
warning
problem
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
it
is
a
problem
its
about
pm
q
the
teacher
would
walk
off
and
then
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
im
just
trying
to
work
this
out
here
i
think
thats
the
best
way
to
handle
it
q
can
i
ask
you
a
series
of
questions
about
the
way
the
president
handled
the
notifications
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
q
did
you
for
instance
talk
to
the
justice
department
about
who
would
come
out
and
discuss
what
had
happened
in
waco
and
whether
it
should
be
the
attorney
general
or
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
why
dont
we
just
take
a
step
even
farther
back
from
that
and
look
at
the
whole
sequence
of
events
on
the
contact
between
the
justice
department
and
the
white
house
as
you
know
and
as
weve
said
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
on
sunday
sunday
afternoon
they
had
a
good
discussion
about
minutes
the
attorney
general
informed
the
president
of
what
she
wanted
to
do
he
raised
no
objections
obviously
she
had
the
implicit
authority
from
the
president
to
go
forward
he
raised
no
objections
she
went
forward
they
had
a
discussion
of
a
general
nature
about
the
incident
again
yesterday
morning
around
am
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
again
they
had
a
brief
discussion
over
what
was
happening
in
waco
as
you
know
this
was
before
the
fire
broke
out
at
the
compound
and
i
think
that
was
why
there
was
some
just
some
confusion
i
think
that
she
was
confusing
in
her
minds
before
and
after
the
fire
not
the
actual
day
when
they
spoke
then
there
was
a
number
of
contacts
at
a
number
of
different
levels
in
the
white
house
yesterday
afternoon
between
the
justice
department
and
the
white
house
they
were
informing
us
of
their
decisions
what
they
would
like
to
do
there
was
an
fbi
briefing
in
waco
the
attorney
general
had
her
press
conference
the
president
then
issued
a
statement
after
that
frankly
yesterday
afternoon
you
know
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
confusion
over
exactly
what
was
happening
on
the
ground
in
waco
and
i
think
that
we
wanted
to
be
very
careful
not
to
have
the
president
say
anything
until
we
had
a
much
better
sense
of
what
was
actually
happening
on
the
ground
once
we
were
fairly
clear
on
what
was
happening
on
the
ground
in
waco
the
president
issued
a
statement
he
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
again
yesterday
evening
q
at
what
hour
was
that
mr
stephanopoulos
it
was
quite
late
i
believe
it
was
after
he
returned
from
the
holocaust
museum
he
took
a
tour
of
the
holocaust
museum
last
night
q
and
he
went
out
to
dinner
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
briefly
yes
he
went
to
dinner
and
then
he
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
last
night
i
dont
know
the
exact
time
i
think
it
was
relatively
late
and
he
just
said
i
think
as
dee
dee
has
reported
that
he
just
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
thought
she
handled
a
difficult
situation
very
well
that
she
did
a
good
job
in
a
tough
situation
and
that
she
should
try
and
get
some
sleep
he
then
again
spoke
with
her
this
morning
about
the
followup
in
waco
and
about
what
theyre
going
to
do
this
afternoon
as
you
know
the
president
will
have
an
announcement
to
make
at
q
did
he
ever
talk
with
webb
hubbell
yesterday
last
night
or
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
no
q
was
webb
hubbell
the
point
man
for
the
white
house
mr
stephanopoulos
webb
hubbell
is
the
general
white
house
liaison
and
several
people
talked
to
webb
the
attorney
general
was
running
the
operation
q
did
he
tell
her
that
she
should
sleep
well
that
she
had
done
a
good
job
or
he
just
tell
her
that
she
should
get
some
sleep
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
sleep
well
done
a
good
job
i
dont
know
the
exact
words
i
think
that
sounds
right
q
i
mean
sleep
well
has
implications
as
to
conscience
and
whether
she
should
feel
badly
about
it
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
mean
i
think
everybody
feels
badly
when
you
have
a
situation
when
q
i
understand
that
but
whether
the
issue
of
blame
is
brought
up
in
that
phraseology
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
the
spirit
no
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
the
spirit
with
which
it
was
offered
was
that
the
entire
administration
and
certainly
the
attorney
general
had
to
face
a
very
difficult
decision
a
very
difficult
situation
yesterday
and
that
he
thought
that
she
had
handled
it
well
as
best
as
she
could
and
q
well
does
he
think
it
was
mishandled
mr
stephanopoulos
it
was
just
speaking
of
warm
words
to
a
friend
q
does
he
think
the
situation
was
mishandled
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
q
in
retrospect
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
stands
by
the
decisions
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
the
decisions
of
the
attorney
general
he
accepts
full
responsibility
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
we
all
want
to
look
to
the
future
and
figure
out
what
exactly
happened
do
a
full
review
and
make
sure
we
do
what
we
can
to
make
sure
this
doesnt
happen
this
kind
of
thing
doesnt
happen
again
or
at
least
we
know
how
to
handle
it
q
how
much
did
he
know
about
what
she
was
going
to
go
ahead
with
i
know
that
she
made
the
case
to
him
explained
outlined
the
case
for
action
did
she
say
to
him
on
sunday
precisely
what
action
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
it
was
specific
operational
detail
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
i
think
that
they
had
a
general
discussion
about
the
action
about
the
advisability
of
action
i
think
as
she
noted
he
asked
a
few
general
questions
just
trying
to
get
a
sense
of
how
things
were
considered
but
it
wasnt
minutebyminute
detail
of
how
the
operation
q
well
was
it
we
are
going
in
is
it
were
going
to
use
tear
gas
i
mean
what
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
it
was
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
some
action
that
would
increase
the
pressure
on
those
in
the
compound
and
hopefully
spur
them
towards
some
sort
of
movement
out
q
george
was
there
ever
a
conscious
political
decision
made
or
even
a
discussion
about
distancing
the
president
from
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
mean
we
were
in
close
contact
with
the
justice
department
the
president
accepts
responsibility
for
this
at
the
same
time
i
mean
we
just
wanted
to
be
very
very
clear
about
how
this
happened
and
be
as
factual
as
we
could
be
on
how
the
decisions
were
made
it
is
the
responsibility
of
those
on
the
ground
to
make
recommendations
the
attorney
general
has
operational
control
over
this
the
president
obviously
accepts
responsibility
for
all
of
this
and
he
stands
by
the
attorney
general
q
george
there
was
a
report
on
the
television
today
and
i
dont
know
more
than
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
cult
had
said
going
into
a
courthouse
that
the
fbi
had
started
the
fire
and
not
themselves
there
was
also
a
picture
yesterday
on
the
tv
of
a
smashing
into
the
building
where
the
fire
broke
out
and
my
question
is
is
the
white
house
absolutely
certain
that
this
fire
was
mr
stephanopoulos
all
the
evidence
we
have
is
that
this
fire
was
started
by
david
koresh
and
those
inside
the
compound
every
bit
of
evidence
we
have
q
did
the
president
ask
the
attorney
general
why
do
this
now
why
this
particular
date
and
did
he
ask
about
possible
consequences
of
either
death
or
injury
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
the
specific
questions
he
had
general
questions
about
how
the
decision
was
going
about
being
made
q
those
are
general
questions
and
did
he
ask
generally
why
now
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
asked
have
you
considered
all
of
the
consequences
have
you
considered
the
recommendations
i
dont
know
if
he
asked
the
question
why
now
i
dont
know
if
he
asked
that
specific
question
q
did
she
tell
him
why
now
in
terms
of
the
stuff
thats
come
out
since
then
about
the
information
provided
by
the
listening
device
about
koresh
getting
increasingly
more
violent
mr
stephanopoulos
again
im
not
certain
how
much
specific
detail
they
got
into
i
know
that
she
generally
said
that
this
is
the
recommendation
shes
prepared
to
make
i
mean
the
decision
shes
prepared
to
make
its
based
on
the
recommendations
she
was
receiving
from
the
field
and
after
intensive
questioning
of
those
involved
again
i
do
not
know
how
precisely
detailed
it
was
beyond
that
q
what
is
the
presidents
understanding
why
yesterday
one
of
the
people
who
went
into
the
compound
a
couple
weeks
ago
came
out
over
the
weekend
with
some
speculation
that
he
may
have
told
law
enforcement
people
something
that
precipitated
this
action
why
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
i
think
what
we
can
go
to
is
what
the
fbi
and
the
attorney
general
has
said
there
were
indications
that
those
inside
the
compound
were
at
some
danger
it
was
clear
that
the
negotiations
had
broken
down
and
it
was
the
judgment
of
the
experts
involved
in
the
negotiations
that
the
situation
was
not
going
to
get
any
better
at
all
there
was
also
some
concern
over
the
vulnerability
of
the
agents
themselves
who
had
been
working
long
beyond
the
time
that
these
teams
normally
have
to
work
and
as
the
attorney
general
has
said
there
was
some
concern
over
the
fact
that
they
did
not
have
replacements
in
place
who
could
stand
in
for
them
and
there
was
a
concern
over
the
safety
all
of
these
factors
came
into
play
they
also
considered
the
advice
of
a
number
of
psychologists
and
other
experts
on
david
koresh
and
those
in
the
compound
i
would
just
go
back
to
what
the
attorney
general
has
said
you
have
to
make
the
best
judgment
you
can
given
the
information
you
have
at
the
time
they
did
obviously
we
all
regret
the
loss
of
life
its
a
terribly
unfortunate
situation
we
all
wish
it
could
have
turned
out
differently
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
judgments
that
were
made
at
the
time
q
george
when
did
the
president
know
that
they
were
going
to
use
tear
gas
was
it
before
the
assault
on
the
compound
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
know
i
dont
believe
he
was
given
a
lot
of
detail
on
exactly
how
the
operation
would
go
i
just
dont
know
q
along
that
point
george
can
you
say
whether
the
plan
was
presented
to
the
president
by
the
attorney
general
as
a
way
to
end
the
standoff
one
way
or
the
other
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
presented
as
a
way
to
increase
the
pressure
on
those
in
the
compound
and
we
all
hoped
as
a
way
to
move
some
of
those
out
and
bring
it
in
it
wasnt
presented
as
tomorrow
is
dday
this
is
it
q
is
the
president
satisfied
that
a
he
had
all
this
relevant
information
necessary
to
make
a
decision
and
b
that
janet
reno
had
all
the
relevant
information
necessary
to
make
a
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
i
think
hes
satisfied
that
they
were
acting
on
the
best
advice
and
the
best
information
they
had
and
hes
not
secondguessing
it
in
any
way
whatsoever
q
george
was
there
a
hour
gap
between
conversations
between
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
in
other
words
they
spoke
at
am
and
they
didnt
speak
again
until
clinton
got
back
from
dinner
at
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
likely
yes
q
did
he
call
her
what
time
did
she
call
was
there
a
gap
between
when
she
called
him
i
mean
was
he
at
dinner
when
she
called
and
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
no
i
think
he
called
her
last
night
i
couldnt
swear
to
it
but
i
believe
he
called
her
last
night
he
just
wanted
to
talk
to
her
q
what
was
going
on
mr
stephanopoulos
not
that
i
know
of
no
q
what
do
you
know
about
the
situation
now
everyone
has
perished
who
except
eight
or
nine
and
do
you
know
any
of
the
other
details
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
any
more
details
than
the
fbi
reported
in
waco
q
watching
cnn
or
how
was
he
keeping
track
of
what
is
going
on
if
he
wasnt
talking
to
his
attorney
general
how
was
he
keeping
track
of
what
was
going
on
here
i
mean
with
all
due
respect
to
cnn
is
that
how
he
was
doing
it
mr
stephanopoulos
no
there
was
also
as
i
said
several
people
in
the
white
house
were
in
constant
contact
with
their
counterparts
at
justice
to
have
the
full
and
complete
information
q
who
were
those
contacts
i
mean
was
it
mack
mclarty
webb
hubbell
how
was
the
president
being
kept
informed
thats
not
a
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
mack
was
in
contact
with
webb
i
spoke
with
several
people
at
the
justice
department
i
believe
bruce
lindsey
spoke
with
people
at
the
justice
department
either
bernie
or
vince
was
also
in
contact
at
different
times
during
the
day
with
people
at
the
justice
department
we
were
fully
briefed
and
fully
informed
q
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
president
may
have
spoken
a
chance
that
he
may
have
spoken
with
webb
do
you
know
if
thats
true
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
a
chance
he
may
have
i
dont
believe
he
did
but
i
think
theres
certainly
a
chance
that
he
may
have
at
some
point
i
dont
believe
he
did
i
think
that
the
last
contact
he
had
during
the
day
yesterday
directly
with
the
justice
department
was
the
am
phone
call
with
the
attorney
general
but
the
white
house
was
fully
informed
on
a
minutetominute
basis
of
what
was
happening
in
waco
and
what
was
happening
at
the
justice
department
q
george
who
decided
that
the
briefing
would
be
done
by
the
attorney
general
mr
stephanopoulos
the
attorney
general
q
did
you
or
did
the
white
house
communications
staff
were
you
ever
involved
with
that
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
no
we
were
told
about
it
q
did
you
ask
her
to
go
on
nightline
and
macneil
lehrer
and
all
that
stuff
was
that
part
of
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
there
was
no
advice
from
the
white
house
at
all
about
her
she
was
on
all
night
all
day
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
and
she
did
a
very
good
job
q
why
did
you
decide
to
have
the
presidents
reaction
to
the
situation
be
only
a
written
statement
which
is
traditionally
the
white
houses
way
of
distancing
the
president
from
the
issue
not
having
him
appear
as
personally
saying
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
well
that
wasnt
the
intent
at
all
as
i
said
we
had
to
we
wanted
to
wait
until
we
had
all
of
the
information
at
hand
the
president
is
also
making
a
statement
today
the
president
made
a
statement
yesterday
morning
the
president
has
been
fully
involved
q
after
this
turned
into
less
than
a
successful
operation
the
only
statement
from
the
president
was
what
was
on
paper
after
the
attorney
general
had
already
given
what
amounted
to
the
major
facts
in
this
mr
stephanopoulos
well
it
was
the
first
statement
from
the
president
not
the
only
statement
from
the
president
number
one
q
after
the
mr
stephanopoulos
number
two
well
the
first
number
two
the
attorney
general
q
he
gave
a
statement
early
in
the
morning
when
the
thing
was
starting
to
move
mr
stephanopoulos
right
and
he
gave
one
yesterday
and
hes
giving
one
today
now
the
second
point
q
it
just
happens
this
was
a
written
statement
with
no
sort
of
communications
policy
or
thought
process
involved
it
was
the
president
wants
to
put
out
a
written
statement
mr
stephanopoulos
knowing
what
we
knew
at
the
time
we
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
the
president
and
he
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
put
out
a
written
statement
expressing
his
regret
and
expressing
his
support
for
the
attorney
generals
q
why
was
it
not
appropriate
for
him
to
personally
do
something
mr
stephanopoulos
well
he
did
personally
do
so
that
is
his
statement
its
a
statement
under
his
name
q
george
yesterday
during
the
briefing
you
didnt
say
the
president
took
full
responsibility
for
what
happened
mr
stephanopoulos
i
certainly
did
q
no
what
you
said
was
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
just
not
right
susan
q
well
i
think
you
can
go
back
to
the
transcript
i
mean
unless
i
miss
something
mr
stephanopoulos
id
love
to
q
janet
reno
said
that
she
took
full
responsibility
and
you
said
that
she
made
the
decision
that
the
fbi
mr
stephanopoulos
and
the
president
takes
responsibility
absolutely
q
took
responsibility
all
right
mr
stephanopoulos
check
the
transcript
q
considering
how
little
was
known
about
what
was
going
on
inside
the
compound
and
even
now
how
little
is
known
why
is
washington
calling
this
a
mass
suicide
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
that
knowing
what
we
know
now
and
given
all
of
the
actions
of
david
koresh
before
and
during
it
is
painfully
clear
that
those
there
were
under
his
control
q
its
stretching
it
a
little
bit
where
the
kids
are
concerned
though
isnt
it
george
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
that
is
an
entirely
different
matter
i
mean
i
think
that
david
koresh
must
bear
responsibility
for
the
deaths
of
those
children
absolutely
but
he
clearly
was
intent
on
creating
some
kind
of
an
apocalyptic
incident
and
thats
what
he
did
q
youre
still
operating
completely
on
assumption
right
i
mean
you
have
no
evidence
or
you
know
of
no
evidence
that
this
was
mass
suicide
mr
stephanopoulos
we
have
evidence
that
those
inside
the
compound
set
fire
to
the
compound
which
led
to
the
deaths
of
those
inside
q
i
didnt
quite
hear
it
this
might
be
anns
question
i
didnt
quite
hear
it
but
at
what
time
did
clinton
himself
put
out
a
statement
on
this
i
know
dee
dee
said
some
stuff
on
this
at
pm
but
the
president
put
out
mr
stephanopoulos
at
pm
pm
q
right
after
the
evening
news
went
on
the
air
mr
stephanopoulos
no
right
when
we
had
all
the
information
we
were
working
on
it
q
dee
dee
confirmed
this
morning
that
the
investigation
the
president
is
going
to
announce
is
going
to
be
an
administrationrun
investigation
why
not
have
someone
from
the
outside
to
make
sure
that
its
not
colored
by
those
who
would
have
a
political
stake
particularly
those
at
the
atf
whose
actions
have
already
been
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
clearly
the
atf
and
the
justice
department
will
bear
responsibility
for
the
investigation
thats
not
to
rule
out
as
is
often
in
investigations
like
this
having
some
sort
of
independent
involvement
as
well
but
it
will
be
run
by
the
treasury
and
justice
q
are
you
confident
that
you
will
not
have
any
problem
getting
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
q
george
did
the
president
reach
out
to
anybody
else
to
get
advice
after
the
meeting
with
janet
reno
and
who
else
in
the
white
house
sat
in
on
that
meeting
anyone
else
from
justice
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
anybody
else
was
there
at
the
time
it
was
a
phone
call
on
monday
it
wasnt
a
meeting
q
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
sunday
it
was
a
phone
call
it
wasnt
a
meeting
i
believe
he
might
have
been
there
with
bruce
but
beyond
that
i
think
he
just
talked
to
the
attorney
general
q
george
you
said
that
in
that
phone
call
she
said
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
action
as
you
said
that
will
force
him
out
what
did
he
think
she
was
talking
about
if
he
didnt
know
about
tear
gas
what
exactly
was
his
idea
of
what
he
was
approving
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
was
approving
an
action
to
increase
the
pressure
on
qq
it
didnt
matter
how
she
did
that
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
i
mean
q
what
information
did
he
have
in
terms
of
how
this
would
proceed
presumably
he
would
have
wanted
to
know
not
minute
byminute
but
in
a
general
sense
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
knew
that
this
was
the
recommendation
of
those
on
the
ground
and
the
recommendation
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
i
just
dont
know
q
what
is
this
when
you
say
that
this
was
the
recommendation
mr
stephanopoulos
the
action
to
increase
pressure
i
dont
know
exactly
what
he
was
told
whether
he
was
going
to
be
told
that
the
tank
was
going
to
go
up
to
the
left
wall
and
punch
a
hole
in
the
window
or
whether
he
was
just
told
generally
that
they
were
moving
forward
in
a
way
that
would
increase
the
pressure
i
just
dont
know
q
its
hard
to
imagine
him
not
asking
though
q
that
janet
reno
presented
him
with
as
her
best
advice
about
what
they
should
go
forward
with
he
would
have
agreed
mr
stephanopoulos
he
was
he
did
ask
some
general
questions
about
the
advice
and
recommendation
he
gave
at
the
same
time
and
i
would
repeat
that
this
was
based
on
the
unanimous
recommendation
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
q
george
it
would
seem
that
this
question
about
just
exactly
in
what
detail
the
president
was
informed
about
the
nature
of
the
operation
is
going
to
come
up
again
here
and
elsewhere
can
you
take
that
question
and
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
yes
q
get
the
answer
and
come
back
to
us
with
all
of
it
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
can
you
tell
us
that
there
was
never
a
meeting
a
strategy
session
where
you
and
others
decided
we
will
put
out
a
written
statement
from
the
president
and
we
will
have
janet
reno
be
on
all
of
these
television
broadcasts
mr
stephanopoulos
never
never
q
and
you
never
called
the
justice
department
and
said
to
anyone
or
janet
reno
youre
the
one
who
needs
to
be
out
front
explaining
this
mr
stephanopoulos
not
once
q
it
just
happened
that
way
that
she
was
the
spokesman
that
no
one
ever
saw
bill
sessions
until
mr
stephanopoulos
she
made
a
decision
as
attorney
general
that
it
was
important
for
her
as
the
operational
officer
in
charge
as
the
person
who
made
the
decision
to
go
out
and
take
the
questions
on
this
tragic
incident
q
she
had
no
guidance
from
the
white
house
at
all
mr
stephanopoulos
we
certainly
didnt
object
q
but
did
you
laughter
no
im
sure
you
didnt
object
but
did
you
suggest
it
was
this
a
plan
mr
stephanopoulos
no
absolutely
not
q
a
strategy
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
did
she
clear
it
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
did
she
notify
you
mr
stephanopoulos
we
certainly
knew
about
it
q
what
happened
to
this
great
detailed
process
you
have
for
clearing
and
talking
to
every
public
information
officer
and
every
under
every
rock
and
every
place
in
government
that
something
as
major
as
this
could
have
occurred
without
a
discussion
between
you
and
the
public
information
people
at
least
at
the
justice
department
mr
stephanopoulos
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
and
the
attorney
general
wanted
to
go
forward
it
seemed
like
a
good
decision
it
was
a
good
decision
she
did
a
good
job
q
let
me
ask
it
this
way
george
if
in
hindsight
how
you
would
handle
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
handled
very
well
q
you
wouldnt
change
a
thing
if
mr
stephanopoulos
change
what
q
the
way
the
white
house
handled
any
part
of
it
from
start
to
finish
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
thats
an
awful
broad
question
and
were
certainly
going
to
have
a
review
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
investigation
is
to
look
for
ways
in
the
future
that
something
like
this
see
what
we
can
learn
from
an
incident
like
this
and
see
what
we
can
learn
about
how
to
handle
them
if
youre
talking
specifically
about
the
issue
of
the
press
conferences
no
there
wouldnt
make
any
change
at
all
q
two
questions
first
of
all
on
her
going
on
tv
no
white
house
people
or
outside
media
consultants
came
up
with
this
idea
its
just
very
reminiscent
of
what
you
guys
did
during
the
campaign
mr
stephanopoulos
how
so
q
im
thinking
of
like
watching
clinton
on
nightline
after
the
draft
story
watching
clinton
on
mr
stephanopoulos
theres
absolutely
no
comparison
yesterday
there
was
a
law
enforcement
incident
the
incident
ended
in
tragic
deaths
of
many
many
people
the
attorney
general
was
involved
in
that
decision
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
to
do
that
she
felt
it
was
her
responsibility
in
the
interest
of
public
information
to
go
out
and
take
the
questions
of
the
press
in
order
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
questions
were
answered
and
she
did
a
fantastic
job
q
the
second
question
is
did
as
someone
who
knows
clinton
as
well
as
you
do
can
you
understand
why
its
sort
of
hard
to
believe
that
he
might
not
have
asked
some
detailed
questions
about
what
she
intended
to
do
in
other
words
she
came
and
she
said
im
going
to
put
pressure
on
them
its
hard
not
to
see
clinton
whos
fairly
intelligent
and
inquisitive
asking
how
q
what
kind
mr
stephanopoulos
both
the
attorney
general
said
that
he
did
ask
questions
he
did
ask
general
questions
i
dont
have
a
minutebyminute
account
of
the
conversation
q
how
long
a
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
about
minutes
q
telephone
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
george
was
the
federal
cost
of
this
standoff
ever
a
consideration
in
terms
of
stepping
up
the
pressure
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
so
no
q
george
you
keep
saying
that
the
president
takes
full
responsibility
but
then
you
refer
to
it
as
her
decision
does
the
president
not
accept
the
fact
that
as
commanderinchief
it
is
ultimately
his
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
what
this
has
to
do
with
commanderinchief
this
was
a
law
enforcement
action
not
a
military
action
and
he
clearly
takes
responsibility
for
the
decisions
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
taken
in
his
government
i
mean
i
think
theres
just
no
ambiguity
about
that
q
but
is
he
accepting
it
as
his
decision
as
well
as
hers
or
is
he
saying
its
her
decision
theres
a
difference
mr
stephanopoulos
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
her
decision
he
did
not
object
to
that
decision
he
clearly
takes
full
responsibility
q
george
this
briefing
has
gone
on
just
a
little
over
minutes
and
as
you
can
see
a
lot
of
things
can
be
exchanged
what
exactly
did
they
spend
minutes
talking
about
if
it
was
just
very
general
thats
a
long
period
of
time
in
a
phone
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
it
is
an
awful
long
phone
conversation
it
was
a
very
important
phone
conversation
i
think
brit
has
asked
that
we
take
the
question
and
ive
said
that
i
would
q
one
of
the
things
reno
said
last
night
is
that
the
buck
stops
here
i
think
that
was
her
direct
quotation
does
the
president
agree
with
that
in
this
case
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
says
he
accepts
full
responsibility
i
think
what
the
attorney
general
was
saying
is
that
she
made
a
decision
that
shes
going
to
accept
all
the
responsibility
that
comes
to
her
and
shes
not
shrinking
from
that
at
all
but
neither
is
the
president
q
at
any
point
in
the
conversation
last
night
between
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
or
this
morning
did
she
ever
offer
her
a
resignation
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
q
even
before
the
fire
was
out
yesterday
there
were
some
republicans
on
capitol
hill
calling
for
an
investigation
is
the
white
house
at
all
concerned
about
the
timing
of
those
requests
trying
to
make
political
hay
out
of
this
situation
mr
stephanopoulos
no
and
i
dont
want
to
cast
any
questions
about
the
motives
of
those
who
are
requesting
investigation
we
want
an
investigation
and
well
have
a
full
and
complete
investigation
q
in
what
forum
will
you
answer
brits
question
will
you
put
out
a
written
statement
will
you
the
wires
how
will
you
answer
the
question
that
youve
taken
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
george
can
you
remind
us
what
the
president
was
doing
all
yesterday
afternoon
where
he
was
and
what
meetings
he
was
involved
in
mr
stephanopoulos
ill
have
to
try
and
remember
he
had
a
series
of
meetings
with
different
members
of
the
staff
during
the
afternoon
he
was
certainly
monitoring
the
situation
in
waco
and
getting
periodic
reports
on
that
as
well
he
did
see
some
on
cnn
as
well
i
believe
he
saw
a
fair
amount
of
the
fbi
press
briefing
as
well
q
and
those
reports
would
have
come
to
him
from
mack
mclarty
would
they
do
you
think
mr
stephanopoulos
mack
talked
to
him
bruce
talked
to
him
i
talked
to
him
q
george
to
follow
helens
question
in
their
conversation
this
morning
did
they
discuss
at
all
her
statement
last
night
in
response
to
the
question
about
whether
she
would
resign
did
he
say
i
dont
know
why
you
felt
the
need
to
say
that
im
here
to
reassure
you
that
you
dont
have
to
do
this
did
that
come
up
at
all
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
it
even
came
up
that
specifically
i
know
that
the
bulk
of
the
conversation
was
discussing
where
do
we
go
from
here
and
what
form
the
investigation
q
the
didnt
talk
at
all
about
her
kind
of
remarkable
comment
last
night
about
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
believe
she
was
asked
a
question
q
and
her
response
was
if
the
president
wants
me
to
i
will
mr
stephanopoulos
which
would
be
i
think
the
standard
response
that
most
cabinet
members
would
give
i
mean
its
a
conditional
statement
q
have
a
need
to
talk
about
whether
personally
about
whether
the
president
wanted
her
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
they
talked
about
it
i
mean
what
i
learned
about
the
conversation
was
that
it
was
largely
about
the
investigation
itself
and
this
just
didnt
come
up
i
did
not
ask
the
question
if
they
talked
about
q
will
you
take
that
with
the
brit
package
mr
stephanopoulos
certainly
laughter
q
george
for
the
record
does
the
president
want
her
to
resign
i
know
dee
dee
answered
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
not
he
supports
janet
reno
shes
a
good
attorney
general
shes
done
a
good
job
she
handled
a
difficult
situation
extremely
well
q
george
does
the
president
feel
that
he
and
janet
reno
were
let
down
by
the
unanimous
professional
advice
from
the
law
enforcement
experts
on
the
ground
mr
stephanopoulos
no
and
the
president
is
not
secondguessing
that
decision
and
those
recommendations
in
any
way
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
doesnt
regret
the
loss
of
life
everybody
regrets
the
loss
of
life
in
this
situation
but
the
best
judgments
were
made
in
a
difficult
situation
based
on
the
best
information
we
had
q
george
the
minute
conversation
was
the
one
on
sunday
is
that
correct
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
how
long
was
the
one
at
am
yesterday
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
ill
take
that
question
too
q
were
these
outside
experts
that
they
were
consulting
with
or
experts
within
the
atf
and
the
fbi
mr
stephanopoulos
youd
have
to
ask
them
im
just
not
sure
i
know
that
there
were
several
experts
q
and
also
why
werent
there
replacements
for
these
people
is
the
unit
that
small
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
think
it
is
a
very
small
highlyspecialized
unit
but
i
think
its
one
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
investigation
will
examine
q
george
isnt
there
a
factor
here
involving
the
fbi
director
normally
a
president
when
he
wants
to
get
information
doesnt
only
asks
the
attorney
general
i
know
the
chain
of
command
but
presidents
talk
to
their
fbi
directors
in
this
case
throughout
this
entire
siege
he
has
not
felt
that
he
could
pick
up
the
phone
and
talk
to
bill
sessions
who
is
from
waco
and
get
expertise
from
him
on
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
talked
to
the
fbi
director
well
in
the
beginning
of
the
situation
when
it
first
broke
out
in
waco
at
the
same
time
the
attorney
general
bears
the
ultimate
responsibility
and
he
was
getting
fully
briefed
from
the
attorney
general
q
dont
you
think
the
ambiguous
situation
that
director
sessions
is
in
has
some
impact
on
the
way
the
president
is
briefed
and
on
the
way
that
all
of
this
evolved
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
mean
its
perfectly
appropriate
that
he
be
briefed
by
the
attorney
general
and
that
the
attorney
general
has
supervisory
authority
over
the
fbi
director
and
thats
following
the
chain
of
command
the
press
thank
you
