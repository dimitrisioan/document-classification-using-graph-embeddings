i
note
with
insufficient
emotion
that
amongst
the
five
survivors
of
the
waco
debacle
there
were
two
brits
and
an
aussie
the
anglosaxon
persona
really
doesnt
lend
itself
to
martyrdom
for
a
spurious
messiah
i
dont
see
how
you
draw
that
conclusion
around
of
the
inside
the
buildings
were
british
one
quarter
two
out
of
the
eight
latest
count
i
heard
survivors
were
british
one
quarter
anyhow
british
doesnt
equate
to
anglosaxon
what
exactly
are
you
trying
to
say
and
why
were
there
no
fireengines
within
a
mile
of
the
compound
because
the
gun
loonies
were
firing
on
vehicles
with
mm
amunition
that
has
a
range
of
meters
next
question
the
problem
is
of
course
the
laws
that
allow
a
bunch
of
raving
nutters
to
collect
a
huge
stack
of
arms
in
the
first
place
the
sequence
of
events
meant
that
there
really
was
no
option
but
to
attempt
some
sort
of
breakthrough
via
an
intervention
if
the
fbi
had
had
the
stomach
for
it
they
could
have
mounted
a
commando
type
raid
and
attempted
to
save
the
children
by
shooting
all
the
adults
it
really
was
a
no
win
situation
koresh
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
give
up
and
stand
trial
for
the
murder
of
the
atf
officers
instead
he
ordered
the
murder
of
the
children
in
order
to
reject
the
word
of
the
fbi
and
batf
it
is
neccessary
to
beleive
the
words
of
a
man
who
has
just
murdered
children
and
ordered
the
suicidemurder
of
his
other
followers
according
to
the
account
given
the
batf
attempted
to
serve
a
warrant
upon
koresh
at
the
ranch
and
were
met
by
gunfire
in
a
deliberate
attempt
to
murder
them
the
koreshgun
supporter
claim
that
the
batf
started
shooting
simply
does
not
stand
up
if
the
aft
had
gone
there
to
start
shooting
they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponry
than
standard
issue
handguns
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
unarmed
the
bd
followers
had
automatic
weapons
the
bd
seige
could
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
indefinitely
the
bd
were
quite
capable
of
commiting
mass
suicide
and
murdering
the
children
at
any
time
a
commando
assault
was
the
only
other
likely
action
that
could
have
achieved
that
objective
that
would
have
been
very
risky
orders
of
magintude
harder
than
antebbe
or
the
iranian
embassy
seige
airplanes
and
embassies
are
not
designed
for
defense
against
attack
ranch
apocalypse
was
terrorists
are
far
easier
to
disloge
without
casualties
than
allowing
the
siege
to
go
on
was
not
an
option
either
besides
the
serious
risk
that
koresh
would
proclaim
armageddon
at
any
moment
there
was
the
question
of
the
difficulties
of
keeping
the
emmergency
team
on
standby
over
a
prolonged
period
the
longer
the
siege
went
on
the
more
mentally
prepared
koresh
and
his
followers
would
be
for
a
prolonged
siege
rather
than
go
in
prematurely
the
mistake
was
probably
to
go
in
too
soon
can
you
think
of
a
better
way
of
getting
the
children
out
a
certain
way
the
people
who
do
not
want
gun
control
must
obviously
discount
the
entire
government
story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
government
conspiracy
theory
whereby
the
government
decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to
get
gun
control
legislation
through
this
conspiracy
theory
assumes
that
the
batf
deliberately
got
of
its
agents
killed
and
that
the
fbi
etc
actually
enjoy
sitting
out
in
the
middle
of
texas
being
shot
at
by
religious
nutters
still
the
conspiracy
theory
is
comforting
it
allows
them
to
pretend
that
waco
proves
nothing
except
about
how
incompetent
the
government
is
in
resolving
a
hostage
crisis
no
govt
in
the
world
has
ever
faced
a
comparable
situation
quite
probably
there
was
no
manner
in
which
it
could
be
peacefully
resolved
the
blame
does
not
rest
on
the
fbi
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
koresh
was
allowed
to
get
so
far
in
particular
the
person
who
tipped
the
bd
off
in
advance
has
the
murder
of
atf
agents
and
children
on
his
or
her
conscience
there
are
a
large
number
of
people
in
the
us
who
predict
the
end
of
society
preach
salvation
through
armed
security
the
fact
is
that
these
are
the
very
people
who
pose
the
threat
to
society
in
the
first
place
the
next
waco
may
not
be
religious
nutters
but
a
political
movement
a
splinter
group
of
the
klu
klux
klan
taking
over
a
schoolhouse
in
a
black
area
for
example
and
holding
several
hundred
children
hostage
the
only
possible
solution
to
such
situations
that
can
work
is
to
prevent
them
arising
no
other
government
in
the
world
has
faced
such
a
situation
this
is
because
no
other
government
has
so
carelessly
allowed
high
power
weaponry
to
become
avaliable
to
any
little
hitler
or
would
be
messiah
to
set
themselves
up
as
dictator
in
their
own
little
empire
