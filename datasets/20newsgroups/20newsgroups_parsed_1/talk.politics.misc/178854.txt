new
study
out

cramer
writes
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
possibly
because
gaybi
men
are
less
likely
to
get
married
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
post
if
it
was
to
show
a
mindless
obsession
with
statistics
an
incredibly
flawed
system
of
reasoning
and
a
repellent
hatemonger
agenda
then
the
purpose
was
accomplished
with
panache
a
get
a

b
get
a
life
c
get
