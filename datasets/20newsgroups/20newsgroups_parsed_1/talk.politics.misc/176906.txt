some
people
are
not
very
good
at
getting
the
best
deal
for
their
effort
and
others
are
unwilling
to
put
forth
much
effort
even
in
the
face
of
economic
incentives
there
will
always
be
some
people
who
are
stupid
or
lazy
relative
to
the
ability
or
effort
of
most
others
the
question
is
what
do
you
do
with
them
there
are
three
options
kill
those
who
are
not
productive
as
a
drain
upon
society
this
is
the
communist
all
who
do
not
toil
shall
not
eat
lenin
or
fascist
approach
youre
being
too
generous
to
the
communists
i
think
in
practice
communism
has
solved
the
problem
by
killing
off
anybody
who
is
too
productive
and
who
therefore
raises
embarrassing
questions
about
why
the
rest
of
the
group
is
a
bunch
of
sluggards
the
mass
butchery
of
kulaks
in
the
ussr
is
a
good
instance
of
this
a
poor
second
best
is
to
have
a
neighboring
capitalist
country
to
which
people
of
politically
incorrect
skill
and
ambition
flee
i
often
wonder
just
what
castro
would
have
done
if
the
cubans
presently
in
miami
would
have
been
forced
to
remain
in
cuba
would
they
have
revolted
and
killed
him
off
or
been
killed
best
of
all
is
to
build
a
wall
locking
the
citizens
of
your
country
in
load
it
up
so
heavily
with
attack
dogs
barbed
wire
and
land
mines
that
most
people
fleeing
over
it
die
and
then
give
everyone
the
choice
of
obedience
prison
or
flight
this
would
be
a
bad
sciencefiction
novel
if
the
east
germans
hadnt
actually
done
it
the
last
person
to
die
crossing
the
wall
as
i
recall
was
an
unarmed
woman
who
was
shot
in
the
back
erich
honecker
was
going
to
go
on
trial
for
that
but
he
fled
to
socialists
in
chile
its
good
to
be
kind
to
ones
intellectual
opponents
but
sometimes
its
a
sheer
waste
of
time
