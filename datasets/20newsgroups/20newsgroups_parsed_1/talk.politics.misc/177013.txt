and
ms
regard
please
dont
give
us
the
trite
you
cant
legislate
morality
nonsense
again
there
is
little
else
that
is
legislated
including
the
moral
concept
of
rights
really
pure
socialism
had
this
belief
and
fell
flat
on
its
ass
by
attempting
to
follow
such
reasoning
suppose
you
pass
a
law
that
states
that
i
must
love
my
neighbour
regardless
of
race
religion
etc
how
exactly
do
you
plan
to
enforce
such
a
law
better
yet
how
do
you
plan
to
measure
compliance
and
even
if
you
overcome
those
two
obstacles
how
will
you
ever
know
if
i
have
become
more
moral
or
not
you
either
missed
the
point
or
are
being
somewhat
disingenuous
i
have
never
heard
anyone
suggest
that
you
can
legislate
what
people
think
laws
are
based
on
either
expediency
ie
traffic
laws
or
morality
ie
human
rights
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
the
majority
are
based
on
the
latter
once
more
around
the
racetrack
see
the
original
statement
that
it
is
nonsense
to
believe
that
you
can
not
legislate
morality
i
simply
stated
that
they
can
pass
all
the
laws
they
want
but
not
a
single
one
of
them
will
make
you
or
i
more
moral
people
they
may
make
us
act
in
a
moral
manner
but
our
actions
are
only
a
reflection
of
the
unwillingness
to
risk
punishment
they
say
nothing
about
whether
we
have
become
more
moral
or
not
perhaps
the
distinction
is
too
fine

tog
im
not
a
feminist
im
for

rights
if
you
dont
believe
in
abortion
dont
have
one
if
you
dont
believe
in
slavery
dont
own
one
if
you
dont
believe
in
murder
dont
commit
one

pro

pro
