in
case
you
missed
it
on
the
newsthe
first
haitians
of
many
that
tested
positive
for
hiv
and
were
being
held
on
a
base
in
cuba
have
been
flown
to
the
us
further
a
us
judge
has
ruled
that
they
must
receive
medical
treatment
or
be
returned
to
a
place
where
they
could
receive
same
so
guess
what
folks
we
taxpayers
get
to
pick
up
the
tab
just
as
you
might
have
expected
for
people
who
have
never
contributed
a
dime
to
the
us
society
i
think
this
government
has
its
priorities
all
screwed
up
if
they
want
to
help
haitianshow
about
removing
the
illegal
government
how
about
giving
them
development
aid
it
does
not
make
sense
to
waste
resources
on
dying
noncitizens
who
will
never
be
productive
in
either
this
country
or
their
own
it
does
not
make
sense
when
the
same
resources
applied
or
even
just
plain
given
to
poor
people
in
haiti
could
significantly
help
people
in
haiti
per
