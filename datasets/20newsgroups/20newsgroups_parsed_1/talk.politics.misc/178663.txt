re
abolish
selective
service
you
selfish
little
bastard
afraid
you
might
have
to
sacrafice
somthing
for
your
country
what
someone
not
approve
a
lone
for
you
to
bad
what
is
immoral
is
people
like
you
and
the
current
president
who
dont
have
any
idea
why
this
country
still
exists
after
years
i
dont
consider
these
ideas
selfish
i
consider
them
rational
i
agree
with
the
body
of
your
post
but
please
reconsider
your
phrasing
here
i
think
these
ideas
are
selfish
and
rational
which
is
commendable
dont
give
selfishness
a
bad
rap
if
we
were
all
selfless
there
would
be
no
moral
reason
not
to
have
a
draft
it
the
draft
is
the
ultimate
in
mindlessly
serving
your
fellow
man
with
no
thought
to
the
importance
of
the
self
the
opinions
expressed
herein
are
not
necessarily
shared

they
came
to
me

viewing
primetime
sitcoms
