they
believe

they

you
are
off
your
target
again
the
law
forces
no
one
to
obey
it
at
every
point
any
individual
may
stand
up
and
say
this
law
sucks
even
you
could
say
this
gay
men
and
women
have
not
forced
you
mean
they
passed
a
law
that
does
nothing
at
all
no
enforcement
mechanisms
as
usual
you
are
wrong
any
off
this
changes
in
the
law
have
been
brought
about
by
democratic
processes
those
same
processes
are
the
ones
that
protect
you
from
certain
abuses
yeah
right
i
guess
the
next
time
a
homosexual
complains
about
sodomy
laws
i
can
just
echo
your
stupidity
about
democratic
processes
and
he
wont
have
any
basis
for
complaint
i
must
admit
that
i
never
understood
why
it
is
referred
to
as
an
abomination
until
i
started
to
read
socmotss
and
started
finding
evidence
that
homosexuality
is
a
response
to
child
molestation
which
is
disproportionately
done
by
homosexuals
just
to
make
brian
kane
happy
of
molestation
is
done
by
homosexuals
and
bisexuals
but
it
is
possible
that
this
is
because
homosexualbisexual
molesters
have
far
more
victims
than
heterosexual
molesters
no
it
isnt
no
it
isnt
no
it
isnt
and
it
depends
on
the
subset
note
subset
of
abuse
you
look
at
repeating
it
three
times
makes
it
more
correct
