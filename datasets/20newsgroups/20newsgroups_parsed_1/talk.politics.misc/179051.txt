i
dont
suppose
youve
heard
of
pythagoras
before
i
have
indeed
heard
of
pythagoras

i
dont
know
that
he
was
ever
disparaged
as
a
bean
eater
in
the
american
southwest
and
west
eg
texas
california
colorado
the
term
bean
eater
is
sometimes
used
as
a
slur
against
those
of
hispanic
heritage
generally
mexicans
in
