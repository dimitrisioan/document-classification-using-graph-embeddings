i
have
to
disagree
you
do
not
take
your
logic
far
enough
true
man
did
not
invent
the
need
for
food
shelter
warmth
and
the
ilk
but
man
did
invent
the
property
laws
and
the
laws
of
trespass
i
guess
xavier
has
never
heard
of
territoriality
in
animals
many
animals
especially
preditors
will
stake
out
a
territory
and
chase
of
any
members
of
the
same
species
that
tries
to
invade
their
territory
yes
i
have
wasnt
there
a
case
of
a
single
lion
ruling
all
the
land
from
south
africa
up
to
egypt
across
to
the
congo
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
there
was
enough
game
to
feed
some
or
more
lions
but
he
wouldnt
let
the
other
lions
hunt
as
he
wanted
it
all
himself
he
died
of
a
heart
attack
brought
on
by
being
overweight
good
thing
too
as
he
had
designs
on
europe
america
north
and
south
and
the
falkland
islands
