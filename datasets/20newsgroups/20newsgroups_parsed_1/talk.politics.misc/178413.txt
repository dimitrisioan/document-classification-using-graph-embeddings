this
is
a
strawman
argument
and
fails
on
several
grounds
in
this
case
limited
and
big
government
are
not
defined
i
would
point
out
that
lebanon
somalia
and
the
former
yugoslavia
are
by
some
definitions
nations
with
limited
government
while
the
us
canada
and
nations
in
western
europe
where
people
would
rather
live
are
often
pointed
out
as
nations
with
big
government
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
well
let
me
help
by
explaining
the
difference
between
a
linited
government
and
a
failed
government
a
limited
government
has
its
powers
clearly
circumscribed
but
is
fully
capable
of
enforcing
its
decisions
within
those
circumscribed
areas
a
failed
government
is
incapable
of
enforcing
its
decisions
except
sporadicly
two
completely
different
beasts
of
course
one
again
faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limited
government
and
those
who
want
unlimited
government
it
is
between
those
who
believe
government
regulation
in
a
capitalist
economy
serves
worthwhile
ends
and
those
who
believe
such
regulation
is
neither
desirable
on
empirical
grounds
nor
justifiable
on
ideological
grounds
regulation
is
such
a
vauge
word
i
wouldnt
call
it
vague
id
call
it
elastic
all
regulation
is
not
necessarily
the
same
by
opposing
all
government
regulation
some
libertarians
treat
every
system
from
a
command
economy
to
those
that
regulate
relatively
free
markets
as
identical
thats
one
reason
many
of
the
rest
of
us
find
their
analysis
to
be
simplistic
