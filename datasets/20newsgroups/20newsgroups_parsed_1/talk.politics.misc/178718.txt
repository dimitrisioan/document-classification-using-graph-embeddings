low
note
this
contradictory
title
gay
activity
low
not
really
the
percentage
of
gays
was
low
headline
writers
arent
noted
for
accuracy
but
you
stated
that
this
study
was
presented
in
a
very
accurate
and
dependable
way
this
is
confusing
to
the
issue
and
if
you
read
this
title
it
implies
that
gay
sex
homosexual
sex
activities
are
low
compared
to
the
general
population
that
they
surveyed
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
actually
were
either
exclusively
homosexual
or
bisexual
you
arent
readiing
very
carefully
well
let
us
quibble
look
at
the
above
statement
that
you
posted
i
have
marked
it
with
it
states
that
are
exclusively
homosexual
it
states
are
or
have
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
please
not
the
use
of
adjective
here
homosexual
sex
now
i
stated
that
if
we
take
as
homosexal
this
is
a
valid
viewpoint
i
believe
that
you
are
either
you
are
not
writing
what
you
think
you
are
writing
you
cant
read
or
remember
what
you
wrote
