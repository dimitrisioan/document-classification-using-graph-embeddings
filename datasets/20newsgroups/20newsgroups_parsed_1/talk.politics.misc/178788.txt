re
janet
reno
killed
the
waco
children
in
a
previous
article
ed
suranyi
says
this
too
is
ridiculous
in
no
way
can
the
provoker
be
considered
to
have
played
more
than
an
exceedingly
minor
role
a
person
who
kills
is
ultimately
responsible
for
his
own
actions
frankly
im
sick
of
being
lied
to
it
was
bad
before
clinton
and
now
its
worse
here
listen
to
ricks
fbi
words
onehalf
hour
before
the
fire
come
out
with
your
hands
up
this
matter
is
now
over
now
i
hear
ricks
and
reno
claiming
that
this
was
just
another
incremental
step
in
pressure
more
bullshit
why
did
they
pick
am
monday
morning
so
nobody
would
notice
so
everyone
would
be
busy
at
work
starting
a
new
week
more
bullshit
did
the
fbi
hold
back
fire
engines
here
let
me
paraphrase
sessions
no
we
didnt
hold
back
the
engines
we
had
them
on
standby
blah
balh
blah
and
so
to
protect
the
the
fireman
we
didnt
allow
the
engines
to
enter
until
it
was
safe
what
the
fuck
is
this
yes
we
have
no
bananas
what
the
hell
kind
of
doubletalk
is
this
no
we
didnt
so
blah
balh
we
did
huh
i
watched
this
clinton
takes
responsibility
even
though
it
wasnt
his
decision
more
bullshit
does
he
or
does
he
not
take
responsibility
no
more
even
though
bullshit
yes
or
no
