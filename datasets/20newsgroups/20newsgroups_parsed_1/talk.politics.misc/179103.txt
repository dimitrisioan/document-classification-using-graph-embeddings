what
exactly
are
you
trying
to
say
and
why
were
there
no
fireengines
within
a
mile
of
the
compound
because
the
gun
loonies
were
firing
on
vehicles
with
mm
amunition
that
has
a
range
of
meters
what
crap
phil
mm
wrong
to
give
you
a
clue
as
to
how
big
mm
is
the
f
fighter
aircraft
have
mm
gattling
guns
used
to
shoot
down
other
aircraft
a
mm
gun
would
be
somewhere
in
the
cannon
realm
they
might
have
had
calibre
but
definitely
not
mm
i
think
that
phil
needs
to
get
out
a
ruler
and
see
exactly
how
big
mm
rounds
are
roughly
diameter
the
type
of
stuff
used
in
antiaircraft
gunnery
calibre
is
much
smaller
but
the
m
effective
range
mi
sounds
about
right
maybe
he
just
got
the
two
confused
the
fbis
reasoning
was
sound
but
the
note
from
phb
was
factually
wrong
