having
completely
dived
into
the
abyss
of
believing
that
there
are
no
queers
in
the
world
who
think
differently
from
the
childmolestationadvocating
minority
on
socmotss
he
doesnt
even
notice
that
hes
starting
a
sentence
with
they
believe
when
the
referent
of
that
they
is
millions
of
people
so
few
as
to
be
irrelevant
if
you
dont
want
to
be
lumped
together
as
a
group
stop
insisting
on
being
treated
as
a
member
of
a
group
please
point
out
where
i
have
said
i
even
was
a
member
of
that
group
much
less
asked
to
be
treated
as
such
much
less
insisted
upon
it
sexual
orientation
is
not
defined
by
the
antidiscrimination
law
that
was
passed
last
year
pedophilia
isnt
a
sexual
orientation
wait
a
minute
youve
been
claiming
for
quite
a
while
now
that
pedophilia
according
to
ca
state
law
is
a
sexual
orientation
now
your
position
is
that
the
law
doesnt
specifically
exclude
it
you
know
damn
well
whats
going
to
happen
some
guy
in
a
nambla
tshirts
going
to
apply
at
a
daycare
theyre
going
to
turn
him
down
hes
going
to
take
it
to
court
and
the
courts
going
to
rule
that
sexual
orientation
is
defined
as
homosexuality
heterosexuality
or
bisexuality
unless
and
until
that
court
decides
that
pedophilia
is
a
sexual
orientation
you
have
no
business
saying
so
silence
death
pin
or
something
they
turn
me
down
because
of
that
i
wholeheartedly
support
their
right
to
take
this
action
i
wouldnt
do
it
myself
unless
it
was
something
like
the
nambla
tshirt
despite
the
fact
that
all
homosexuals
are
lying
bastards
how
about
a
black
man
applies
for
a
job
at
a
bank
the
bank
decides
based
on
statistics
a
black
person
would
be
more
likely
to
steal
money
and
denies
the
man
the
job
would
you
support
the
banks
right
to
this
freedom
i
support
their
right
to
do

deletia
