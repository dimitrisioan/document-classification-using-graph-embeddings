top
ten
signs
that
its
the
age
of
aquarius
on
pennsylvania
avenue
men
in

persona

algores
enviromentalism
will
make
the
clean
air
act
look
like
an
industrial
policy
higher
taxes
are
once
again
the
prescription
for
all
that
ails
america
tax
dodging
is
unpatriotic
draft
dodging
is
a
symbol
of
pride
beaded

socialism
may
be
dead
in
the
exsoviet
union
but
we
are
told
to
prepare
for
the
nationalization
of
our
health
care
resources
these
people
must
be
inhaling
something
not
quite
free
love
but
eating
flowers
is
considered
healthy
the
feminazis
have
a
president
in
the
white
house
whether
the
rest
of
us
realize
it
or
not
slick
may
be
the
first
draft
dodger
to
send
american
troops
into
combat
slick
may
be
unpopular
with
middleclass
americans
but
hes
a
big

heres
my
own
top
ten
response
to
mr
ipsers
list
its
about
time
we
have
a
president
that
might
actually
stand
up
to
the
military
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
must
learn
that
the
world
does
not
revolve
around
them
and
that
one
of
the
things
theyre
out
there
defending
is
our
right
to
be
critical
of
them
even
denounce
them
let
me
explain
something
to
you
environmental
policy
and
industrial
policy
must
go
hand
in
hand
our
nation
and
indeed
our
planet
can
not
afford
to
continue
ignoring
this
as
was
done
over
the
last
twelve
years
our
industrialenvironmental
position
has
been
downright
shameful
we
must
have
active
government
support
of
the
key
industries
such
as
telecommunications
microelectronics
medical
biotech
and
environmental
tech
meanwhile
weed
out
old
inneficient
highpolution
industries
that
are
better
left
to
other
nations
this
will
make
us
richer
help
produce
new
jobs
and
help
the
environment
to
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
i
heard
a
lot
of
this
in
a
speech
by
senator
john
kerry
dma
tonite
in
addition
its
time
we
get
really
really
serious
about
issues
like
overpopulation
globabl
warming
and
ozone
depletion
the
planet
on
which
we
live
should
be
our
utmost
priority
it
just
so
happens
that
that
it
takes
money
to
make
this
country
work
to
provide
the
services
that
people
need
and
to
help
solve
the
problems
that
need
to
be
solved
granted
some
things
can
probably
be
done
more
efficiently
for
less
money
and
should
be
but
some
things
are
going
to
cost
more
money
and
im
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
everyone
whining
about
taxes
all
the
time
you
want
to
live
in
my
country
you
pay
your
fair
share
i
cant
believe
what
hypocrites
people
are
when
they
ask
people
to
give
up
their
lives
for
their
country
and
then
complain
about
taxes
if
youre
willing
to
send
me
off
to
die
for
some
stupid
obsession
with
fighting
an
enemy
which
at
best
doesnt
affect
us
and
at
worst
really
should
be
our
friend
then
you
have
no
right
to
tell
me
you
shouldnt
pay
taxes
hey
i
think
the
beaded
curtains
add
a
lovely
sesque
touch
look
canada
europe
and
japan
manage
to
provide
health
care
for
their
citizens
and
yes
basic
health
is
a
human
right
which
people
are
entitled
to
if
these
nations
arent
capitalist
enough
for
you
then
i
guess
weve
found
something
better
than
capitalism
there
is
nothing
sacred
about
the
capitalist
system
and
if
something
be
it
socialism
or
anything
else
works
better
then
i
say
let
capitalism
die
make
love
not
war
contrary
to
popular
belief
it
is
possible
to
be
a
male
and
a
feminist
at
the
same
time
to
discriminate
against
or
to
deny
equal
opportunity
to
a
majority
of
the
population
is
just
plain
wrong
and
trying
to
force
them
into
some
sort
of
tradition
role
is
even
worse
women
certainly
have
as
much
to
offer
this
world
as
men
and
the
day
that
gender
discrimination
is
finally
broken
it
going
to
make
all
the
revolutions
of
the
past
few
centuries
seem
like
reform
bills
i
look
forward
to
it
see
