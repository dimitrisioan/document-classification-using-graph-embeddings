they
are
losing
their
humor
please
take
a
break
until
they
get
funny
again
if
that
is
even
possible
i
liked
a
few
of
these
but
that
list
is
not
even
sarcastic
just
insulting
and
definitely
not
one
of
your
best
i
look
forward
to
some
better
lists
after
a
sabatical
no
they
must
be
working
they
are
getting
lots
of
these
complaints
that
they
are
not
funny
keep
em
coming
it
they
werent
funny
or
bothering
them
theyd
just
ignore
them
if
a
six
year
old
child
does
a
funny
trick
and
you
say
well
done
he
will
do
it
again
and
it
may
be
funny
then
they
may
repeat
it
over
and
over
again
bu
you
still
have
to
pretend
its
funny
even
though
it
isnt
any
more
once
they
are
older
than
six
you
expect
them
to
realise
that
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
isnt
funny
any
more
basicaly
ed
fails
to
be
amusing
because
he
is
merely
crass
he
does
not
make
jokes
that
have
any
political
content
beyond
attempting
to
ridicule
their
target
calling
someone
slick
willie
is
not
funny
even
if
you
put
on
a
red
nose
while
you
say
it
it
was
a
good
debating
point
used
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
months
ago
but
now
its
use
merely
demonstrates
that
the
user
couldnt
think
of
anything
original
to
say
in
the
uk
there
is
a
tradition
of
old
retired
colnels
who
bore
the
dinner
guests
rigid
with
their
descriptions
of
old
campagns
ed
is
clearly
one
of
this
type
of
people
who
fails
to
see
when
a
joke
is
spent
