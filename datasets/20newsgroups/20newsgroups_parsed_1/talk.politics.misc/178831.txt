just
try
to
justify
the
war
on
drugs
i
dare
you
a
friend
of
mine
who
smoke
pot
every
day
and
last
tuesday
took
hits
of
acid
is
still
having
trouble
aiming
for
the
bowl
when
he
takes
a
dump
dont
as
me
how
i
just
have
seen
the
results
boy
i
really
wish
we
we
cut
the
drug
war
and
have
more
people
screwed
up
in
the
head
im
sorry
about
your
friend
really
but
this
anecdote
does
nothing
to
justify
the
war
on
drugs
if
anything
it
demonstrates
that
the
war
is
a
miserable
failure
what
it
demonstrates
is
that
people
will
take
drugs
if
they
want
to
legal
or
not
perhaps
if
your
friend
were
taking
legal
regulated
drugs
under
a
doctors
supervision
he
might
not
be
in
the
position
hes
in
now
dale
cook
any
town
having
more
churches
than
bars
has
a
serious
social
problem

the
opinions
are
mine
only
ie
they
are
not
my
employers
