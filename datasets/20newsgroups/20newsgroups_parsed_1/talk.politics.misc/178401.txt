new

study
out

percentage
in
clayton
cramer
writes
from
the
santa
rosa
cal
pressdemocrat
april
p
b
male
sex
survey
gay
activity
low
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
etc
etc
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
sure
and
whats
of
a
woman
any
hypothesis
how
can
you
trust
a
report
from
people
that
have
no
idea
of
what
a
median
is
the
same
bullshit
article
reported
that
of
all
the
men
have
sex
times
or
more
a
week
elf
how
many
times
did
you
fill
one
of
those
questionnaires
and
had
other
statistics
that
took
in
no
consideration
different
class
backgrounds
marital
status
etc
no
information
on
sampling
were
given
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
do
you
think
you
can
compare
so
lightly
secondary
data
from
very
different
and
discutible
surveys
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
it
just
shows
how
dramatically
ignorant
are
press
release
writers
and
most
pople
that
read
them
