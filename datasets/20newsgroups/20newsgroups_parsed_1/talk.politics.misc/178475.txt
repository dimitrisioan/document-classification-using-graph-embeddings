i
couldnt
disagree
with
you
more
strongly
it
sounds
good
but
in
practice
it
too
often
becomes
tyranny
because
there
are
too
often
conflicting
ideas
of
what
constitutes
improving
the
human
condition
far
better
to
let
people
and
their
organizations
pursue
whatever
goals
they
think
best
and
let
the
human
condition
be
improved
by
those
who
are
willing
to
do
so
without
coercion
there
will
always
be
conflicting
ideas
on
what
constitutes
improving
the
human
condition
thats
humanity
you
seem
to
believe
that
libertarianism
will
improve
the
human
condition
by
lifting
all
constraints
and
that
people
will
have
a
better
chance
of
improving
themselves
in
that
environment
let
me
try
to
put
it
another
way
libertarians
believe
that
an
unconstrained
environment
provides
the
best
chance
of
solving
any
problem
because
it
maximizes
creativity
however
there
is
never
any
guarantee
that
a
really
good
solution
will
ever
be
found
to
any
particular
problem
utopia
is
not
an
option
utopia
is
a
myth
although
we
can
do
a
lot
better
than
what
we
have
today
but
i
think
that
you
must
pitch
libertarianism
as
a
progressive
agenda
ie
you
can
do
better
under
our
style
of
system
i
admire
a
lot
of
what
the
libertarians
stand
for
but
you
guys
are
some
of
the
worst
salesmen
i
have
ever
seen
and
when
it
comes
to
politics
you
need
salesmen
whether
you
want
them
or
not
what
we
need
are
more
people
who
agree
with
us
know
something
about
marketin
and
are
willing
to
both
do
that
marketing
and
teach
others
how
to
are
you
in
im
flattered
by
your
invitation
but
im
afraid
you
have
the
wrong
person
although
i
completely
agree
with
your
civil
liberties
agenda
im
not
in
support
of
your
economic
agenda
what
i
do
like
about
the
libertarian
party
is
that
you
guys
are
so
good
at
shaking
up
the
tired
ideas
of
the
past
i
encourage
you
guys
to
continue
your
crusade
but
im
afraid
i
cant
ride
along
