the
selective
service
registration
should
be
abolished
to
start
with
the
draft
is
immoral
whether
you
agree
with
that
or
not
we
dont
have
one
now
and
military
experts
agree
that
the
quality
of
the
armed
forces
is
superior
with
a
volunteer
army
than
with
draftees
finally
the
government
has
us
on
many
lists
in
many
computers
the
irs
social
security
admistration
and
motor
vehicle
registries
to
name
a
few
and
it
can
find
us
if
it
needs
to
maintaining
yet
another
list
of
people
is
an
utter
waste
of
money
and
time
lets
axe
this
whole
department
and
reduce
the
deficit
a
little
bit

people
like
you
and
the
current
president
who
dont
have
any
idea
why
this
country
still
exists
after
years
this
