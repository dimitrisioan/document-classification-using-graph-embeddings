larouche
and
los

times
foreign
correspondent
scott
kraft
who
is
based
in
south
africa
authorities
said
much
of
the
material
collected
by
the
groups
was
confidential
information
obtained
illegally
from
law
enforcement
agencies
they
also
alleged
that
data
on
some
individuals
and
organizations
was
sold
separately
to
the
south
african
government
in
addition
to
allegations
of
obtaining
confidential
information
from

the

could
face
a
total
of
felony
counts
for
not
properly
reporting
the
employment
of
its
chief
west
coast
spy
roy
bullock
according
to
the
affidavit
filed
to
justify
the
search
warrant
the
antidefamation
league
disguised
payments
to
bullock
for
more
than
years
by
funneling
a
week
to
beverly
hills
attorney
bruce
i
hochman
who
then
paid
bullock
according
to
the
documents
released
in
san
francisco
hochman
a
former
president
of
the
jewish
federation
council
of
greater
los

and
one
of
the

leading
tax
attorneys
will
be
out
of
the
city
until
late
next
week
and
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
his
office
said
until
hochman
a
former
us
prosecutor
also
was
a
member
of
a
panel
appointed
by
thensen
pete
wilson
to
secretly
make
initial
recommendations
on
new
federal
judges
in
california
hochman
is
a
former
regional
president
of
the
antidefamation
league
the
league
which
initially
cooperated
with
police
has
denied
repeatedly
that
its
intelligencegathering
operation
broke
any
laws
league
officials
will
not
confirm
or
deny
whether
bullock
was
an
employee
and
have
said
they
simply
traded
information
with
police
departments
about
people
who
might
be
involved
in
hate
crimes
but
in
an
affidavit
filed
to
obtain
warrants
for
thursdays
searches
san
francisco
police
alleged
that
adl
employees
were
apparently
less
than
truthful
in
providing
information
during
an
earlier
search
conducted
without
a
warrant
david
lehrer
executive
director
of
the
los
angeles
adl
office
said
the
organization
has
not
violated
the
law
there
is
nothing
nefarious
about
how
we
operate
or
what
we
have
done
he
said
our
record
speaks
for
itself
the
police
affidavit
contends
that
lehrer
had
sole
control
of
a
secret
fund
used
to
pay
for
factfinding
operations
lehrer
according
to
the
documents
signed
checks
from
the
account
under
the
name
l
patterson
an
adl
official
said
the
account
was
used
to
pay
for
subscriptions
to
a
wide
variety
of
extremist
publications
that
might
balk
at
sending
them
directly
to
the
antidefamation
league
bullock
who
has
been
collecting
intelligence
for
the
adl
for
nearly
years
defended
his
efforts
during
a
lengthy
interview
with
san
francisco
police
he
said
that
he
gathered
names
from
many
sources
and
entered
them
into
his
computer
under
headings
such
as
skins
and
pinkos
but
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
were
under
surveillance
i
might
never
see
or
call
up
on
of
them
again
bullock
said
and
it
doesnt
mean
anything
that
theyre
in
the
files
its
not
a
threat
to
anyones
civil
rights
that
a
name
appears
in
my
files
under
say
pinko
in
recent
years
bullock
worked
closely
with
san
francisco
police
officer
tom
gerard
who
fled
to
the
phillippines
last
fall
after
he
was
questioned
by
the
fbi
in
the
case
a
former
cia
employee
gerard
supplied
bullock
with
criminal
records
and
department
of
motor
vehicles
information
such
as
home
addresses
vehicle
registration
physical
characteristics
and
drivers
license
photographs
using
files
gathered
for
the
antidefamation
league
gerard
and
bullock
also
provided
information
to
the
south
african
government
receiving
over
four
years
the
documents
show
the
file
on
times
staff
writer
kraft
which
was
apparently
sold
to
the
south
african
government
provides
some
insight
into
the
hitandmiss
nature
of
the
spy
operation
the
file
notes
that
krafts
articles
appear
frequently
in
the
times
and
are
well
researched
and
written
but
little
else
about
the
file
is
accurate
the
brief
entry
confuses
the
times
kraft
with
another
scott
kraft
and
provides
the
south
african
government
with
the
wrong
krafts
physical
description
photograph
and
other
personal
information
nevertheless
the
documents
provide
illuminating
details
of
how
bullock
for
decades
infiltrated
all
manner
of
organizations
from
skinheads
to
leftwing
radicals
searching
regularly
through
the
trash
of
target
groups
using
antidefamation
league
funds
he
also
ran
his
own
paid
informants
under
code
names
such
as
scott
and
scumbag
he
worked
closely
with
police
officers
up
and
down
the
coast
exchanged
information
with
the
fbi
and
worked
with
federal
agencies
including
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
it
was
bullocks
work
as
a
paid
informant
for
the
fbi
while
spying
on
behalf
of
the
antidefamation
league
and
the
south
african
government
that
proved
his
undoing
the
fbi
learned
that
he
was
an
agent
of
a
foreign
government
and
began
investigating
leading
to
the
probe
of
the
antidefamation
leagues
intelligence

the

undercover
operatives
to
gather

in
los

according
to
the

and
the

the

which
earlier
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
investigation
was
informed
of
the
searches
in
los

but
not
invited
to
participate
investigators
suspect
that
some
confidential

vows
to
cooperate
with
spy
investigation
by
richard
c
paddock
times
staff
writer
san
francisco
the
antidefamation
league
defended
its
record
as
a
civil
rights
group
friday
and
said
it
will
cooperate
with
authorities
who
are
investigating
whether
the
organization
collected
confidential
police
information
on
citizens
and
groups
but
san
francisco
dist
atty
arlo
smith
said
that
antidefamation
league
employees
involved
in
intelligence
gathering
could
face
many
felony
counts
of
receiving
confidential
files
eavesdropping
tax
violations
and
conspiracy
police
have
accused
the
antidefamation
league
of
not
being
truthful
about
its
spying
operations
which
collected
information
on
more
than
individuals
and
political
groups
across
the
political
spectrum
hundreds
of
pages
of
documents
released
by
prosecutors
thursday
show
that
the
adl
maintained
a
nationwide
intelligence
network
and
kept
files
on
political
figures
even
so
smith
suggested
that
if
the
antidefamation
league
shut
down
its
spy
operation
prosecutors
would
take
that
into
account
when
deciding
what
charges
to
file
in
a
statement
released
in
washington
national
director
abraham
h
foxman
described
the
adl
as
a
jewish
defense
agency
which
has
fought
to
protect
all
minorities
from
bigotry
and
discrimination
for
years
foxman
said
the
organization
is
regarded
as
a
credible
source
on
extremist
groups
and
has
a
tradition
of
routinely
providing
information
to
police
journalists
academics
government
officials
and
the
public
it
has
never
been
the
policy
of
the
adl
to
obtain
information
illegally
he
said
like
other
journalists
in
order
to
protect
the
confidentiality
and
physical
safety
of
its
sources
adl
will
not
comment
on
the
nature
or
identity
of
any
source
of
information
foxman
said
the
antidefamation
league
refused
to
acknowledge
that
one
of
its
longtime
employees
roy
bullock
was
anything
more
than
a
private
individual
who
is
alleged
to
be
an
adl
informant
among
the
documents
released
by
prosecutors
were
detailed
statements
showing
how
the
adl
funneled
weekly
payments
to
bullock
through
beverly
hills
attorney
bruce
i
hochman
roy
would
penetrate
organizations
and
needed
this
arrangement
to
be
distanced
from
adl
hochman
told
a
san
francisco
police
investigator
hochman
could
not
be
reached
friday
at
his
home
or
office
for
comment
despite
the
antidefamation
leagues
assertion
that
it
will
cooperate
with
authorities
san
francisco
police
said
the
group
did
not
turn
over
all
pertinent
documents
during
a
voluntary
search
of
the
groups
offices
in
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
last
fall
a
second
round
of
searches
thursday
this
time
with
search
warrants
produced
a
vast
quantity
of
records
primarily
dealing
with
financial
transactions
smith
said
further
searches
may
be
necessary
and
it
will
be
at
least
a
month
before
any
charges
are
filed
he
said
the
investigation
of

will
go
wherever
