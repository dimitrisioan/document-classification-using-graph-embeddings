freedom
of
association
from

in
article
phil
ronzone
wrote
a
very
well
put
together
post
i
disagree
with
several
key
points
but
the
post
is
an
excellent
one
with
which
to
engage
in
discourse
i
agree
wholeheartedly
paul
you
have
handled
this
so
well
i
think
that
you
could
write
ballot
materials
thank
you
id
hoped
to
avoid
the
rancor
that
has
characterized
much
of
the
debate
on
this
issue
im
also
not
going
to
prolong
the
debate
on
this
i
wanted
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
points
you
make
but
this
will
be
my
last
posting
on
this
no
dont
stop
right
to
equal
opportunity
lets
call
it
reo
involves
coercion
in
all
cases
by
definition
one
question
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
reo
or
just
that
this
is
a
lesser
right
to
foa
good
question
it
just
depends
hows
that
for
an
answer
seriously
i
believe
that
it
depends
on
wether
or
not
you
are
talking
about
a
governmental
employer
or
not
in
this
case
i
believe
that
there
should
be
absolutely
no
discrimination
direct
or
indirect
period
i
feel
this
way
not
because
it
would
offend
my
moral
sensibilities
which
it
of
course
would
but
because
the
government
is
a
coercive
entity
which
we
can
not
escape
it
boggles
my
mind
that
in
my
lifetime
there
were
whites
only
drinking
fountains
in
some
parks
but
no
fountains
for
others
yet
the
taxes
garnished
to
support
those
fountains
certainly
were
not
applied
to
whites
only
in
essence
we
can
not
escape
the
coercive
state
even
randy
weavers
have
to
pay
property
tax
on
the
other
hand
private
employers
are
not
a
monopoly
and
their
businesses
should
be
run
by
them
and
not
by
the
government
unless
they
elect
to
turn
their
affairs
over
to
that
government
why
says
who
why
can
mom
pop
have
foa
but
ibm
be
forced
and
force
is
the
correct
word
here
to
have
reo
in
the
case
of
the
mom
pop
store
their
foa
is
directly
affected
they
as
individuals
will
have
to
associate
with
whomever
they
hire
in
the
case
of
ibm
i
ask
again
whose
foa
are
we
protecting
i
do
not
accept
that
ibm
as
a
corporate
entity
has
a
right
to
foa
but
if
the
mom
pop
store
is
affected
by
who
they
hire
isnt
ibm
there
is
a
slippery
slope
here
in
santa
cruz
where
a
number
of
loony
antidiscrimination
laws
exist
a
guy
sued
a
restaurant
for
not
hiring
him
because
he
had
every
imaginable
kitchen
utensil
dangling
from
his
earlobe
and
his
tatoos
were
very
distracting
suddenly
by
arm
waving
by
magic
a
landlord
does
not
have
foa
and
on
what
basis
does
the
foa
of
the
landlord
disappear
it
seems
that
vague
terms
like
no
contact
with
tenants
suffice
on
the
basis
that
the
landlord
has
no
contact
with
hisher
tenants
if
the
landlord
doesnt
associate
with
his
tenants
then
how
can
he
complain
that
his
foa
is
being
violated
i
have
a
lot
of
interaction
all
positive
with
my
tenants
so
i
guess
that
that
isnt
an
issue
but
say
i
were
to
buy
a
unit
in
another
town
and
have
it
managed
by
a
third
party
lets
say
that
i
have
a
real
aversion
to
christians
because
of
the
stuff
that
they
buy
into
hook
line
and
sinker
and
because
of
the
lunatic
schmucks
that
they
try
to
get
elected
i
dont
want
any
of
those
fish
symbols
hanging
in
the
window
of
a
house
that
i
own
should
the
government
intervene
if
i
was
elie
weizel
and
the
only
rental
applicant
was
tom
metzger
should
i
be
forced
to
rent
this
distant
unit
to
him
the
companies
on
the
fortune
for
example
are
all
privately
owned
they
can
give
you
a
list
of
all
of
their
owners
they
have
no
anonymous
unknown
to
them
owners
publicly
owned
in
the
sense
that
their
stock
is
publicly
traded
and
that
the
shares
of
stock
are
owned
by
a
generic
and
everchanging
public
yes
and
the
neat
thing
about
this
is
that
unlike
the
mom
pop
store
you
and
i
can
buy
shares
in
ibm
and
have
influence
over
their
decision
making
policies
if
we
dont
like
them
anyway
