anyone
with
any
degree
of
sensitivity
or
awareness
has
to
be
concerned
about
the
horrendous
amount
of
child
abuse
that
exists
in
this
country
the
critical
factor
here
is
whether
the
sexual
activity
is
forced
when
a
child
is
forced
there
is
often
damage
on
the
other
hand
consensual
relationships
are
often
found
to
be
positive
experiences
for
all
concerned

i
can
see
that
they
might
be
appropriate
where
there
is
a
legitimate

that
the

are
being
distorted

that
they

reading
your
comments
above
one
might
be
excused
if
they
assumed
that
you
were
claiming
that
child
abuse
forced
sexual
activity
and
damage
caused
by
this
is
nonexistant
or
greatly
overblown
