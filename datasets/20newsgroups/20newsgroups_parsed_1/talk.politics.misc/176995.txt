i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
found
better
means
of
refuting
or
responding
to
the
substantive
points
and
information
in
the
sb
the
sb
needs
no
refutation
by
me
the
patent
absurdity
of
your
beloved
great
book
speaks
for
itself
your
ignorance
is
clearly
showing
itself
again
mark
why
dont
you
read
the
post
and
show
us
all
where
the
silver
bulletin
is
wrong
it
is
an
expose
of
the
corruption
and
fraud
in
government
or
do
you
feel
that
our
wonderful
state
is
just
nifty
and
sweet
fine
if
you
think
its
an
expose
of
corruption
and
fraud
please
prevent
a
jury
question
dont
just
reassert
your
opening
statement
for
those
in
the
dark
i
wrote
to
teels
sysadmin
noting
that
a
he
wastes
bandwidth
by
posting
identical
messages
long
ones
to
several
newsgroups
independently
instead
of
crossposting
and
b
he
has
improperly
used
his
posts
to
advertise
goods
for
sale
a
i
was
requested
to
post
to
those
groups
and
they
were
getting
deleted
by
whom
b
the
goods
for
sale
was
a
method
of
showing
the
source
and
obtaining
further
info
and
the
message
in
question
was
retrieved
in
its
entirety
from
the
net
i
simply
reposted
it
from
one
year
ago
would
there
be
a
complaint
if
i
had
posted
an
article
from
newsweek
then
posted
the
address
and
subscription
price
how
about
the
subscription
info
for
the
american
law
review
bit
of
a
double
standard
yeah
think
so
no
indication
that
was
what
happened
until
now
editing
down
is
always
possible
readers
more
careful
than
aj
will
note
that
the
complaint
appended
below
expressly
disclaims
any
wish
to
suppress
teels
postings
merely
because
they
are
infantile
irrational
and
tedious
more
name
calling
mark
is
that
your
best
shot
oh
i
see
the
reason
for
your
sending
that
letter
had
nothing
to
do
with
your
opinion
of
my
information
right
clearly
your
motivations
were
the
best
interest
of
all
of
those
poor
users
who
could
not
speak
for
themselves
if
we
werent
talking
about
attempted
censorshipsp
it
would
be
funny
further
your
perception
for
want
of
a
better
term
is
not
the
feedback
that
i
have
been
getting
via
email
and
others
the
keep
it
ups
outnumber
the
go
aways
at
least
to
it
would
be
interesting
to
hear
who
the
responding
parties
are
i
for
one
have
no
intention
of
being
a
slave
you
may
be
so
if
you
like
just
remember
where
you
heard

are
you
for

purposes
only
dont
let

this
mr

and
by
the
way
the
reference
to

is
made
in

with

rights
is
the
recourse
and
is
the
remedy
and
as
has
been
noted
more
times
than
we
care
to
count
about
