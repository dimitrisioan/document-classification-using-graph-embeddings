in
a
letter
to
the
fbi
david
koresh
said
do
you
want
me
to
pull
back
the
heavens
and
show
you
my
anger
fear
me
the
day
standoff
between
federal
agents
and
the
branch
davidians
ended
on
april
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
mass
suicide
by
fire
now
that
the
multimillion
dollar
standoff
is
over
a
few
things
remain
cleaning
up
the
mess
and
assigning
blame
from
the
onset
of
the
april
tear
gas
attacks
by
federal
agents
president
clinton
already
started
passing
the
buck
by
saying
talk
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
fbi
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
done
but
the
decision
was
it
entirely
theirs
it
they
made
the
tactical
decision
enter
attorney
general
janet
reno
after
most
of
the
branch
davidians
died
reno
said
she
took
full
responsibility
for
the
decision
i
approved
the
plan
she
said
adding
that
she
did
not
advise
him
clinton
as
to
the
details
in
fact
she
told
clinton
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
go
as
the
fire
was
roaring
through
the
branch
davidians
compound
clinton
said
that
he
was
deeply
sadened
by
the
loss
of
life
and
in
the
same
breath
that
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
in
the
waco
siege
recommended
the
course
of
action
pursued
today
later
he
went
on
to
say
i
stand
by
that
renos
decision
how
did
this
all
begin
at
on
february
agents
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
batf
launched
a
fullscale
highprofile
assault
on
the
branch
davidians
compound
this
raid
was
much
more
than
an
assault
on
a
group
suspected
of
possessing
illegal
weapons
the
assault
was
a
planned
media
circus
used
as
a
propaganda
device
of
the
batf
to
show
their
might
and
just
purpose
at
the
onset
of
the
noknock
raid
gaggles
of
heavily
armed
batf
agents
made
their
way
inside
the
compound
without
identifying
themselves
or
state
that
they
had
a
warrant
until
long
after
the
shooting
began
silently
the
agents
made
their
way
to
the
compounds
buildings
and
started
their
search
by
charging
at
the
buildings
and
throwing
concussion
grenades
and
ordering
the
cult
members
to
come
out
of
the
buildings
if
unknown
persons
dressed
in
black
ninja
costumes
and
combat
fatigues
were
to
attack
you
throwing
grenades
and
brandishing
firearms
would
you
not
assume
that
these
people
are
criminals
and
attempt
to
defend
yourself
the
tactics
employed
by
the
batf
provoked
the
battle
the
initial
assualt
by
the
batf
was
not
successful
unfortunately
lives
were
lost
on
both
sides
but
had
the
assault
been
a
success
the
liberal
media
would
have
praised
the
batf
by
showing
the
footage
of
batf
agents
carting
away
a
bunch
of
gunwielding
religious
nuts
of
course
any
violation
of
the
cults
rights
would
have
been
overlooked
and
the
media
would
proclaim
americas
fortune
in
having
supercop
organizations
like
the
batf
that
can
systematically
take
out
terroristic
groups
such
as
the
branch
davidians
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
batf
and
the
fbi
dropped
the
ball
just
like
philadelphia
did
in
the
move
crisis
which
left
dead
homeless
and
a
city
block
razed
it
appears
that
the
batf
has
adopted
the
shootfirst
tactic
of
noknock
raids
to
execute
search
warrants
dont
let
the
batf
convince
you
that
the
noknock
raid
was
justified
noknock
assaults
make
sense
when
looking
for
say
drugs
that
can
easily
be
hidden
or
disposed
of
in
a
few
seconds
the
batf
was
looking
for
illegal
weapons
not
drugs
that
could
be
hidden
or
flushed
down
the
toilet
in
a
matter
of
a
few
seconds
what
ever
happened
to
this
is
the
police
you
are
surrounded
it
this
policy
of
noknock
raids
by
federal
and
local
agencies
should
be
restricted
further
the
use
of
military
firepower
against
presumed
innocent
citizens
is
a
very
scary
idea
and
is
why
the
davidians
were
justified
in
using
lethal
force
to
ensure
that
their
fourth
ammendment
rights
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons
houses
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
are
not
denied
