while
i
respect
his
right
to

so
my
own
opinions
are
that
followupto
fields
are
mere
suggestions
not
mandatory
commands
and
this
issue
is
of
sufficient
a
general
political
relevance
and
b
civil
liberties
interest
to
warrant
keeping
it
active
in
tpm
and
ascl
as
well
at
least
for
this
round
in
article
said
uh
no
thats
not
what
happened
in
boomer
what
happened
in
boomer
was
that
the
judge
didnt
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
blackmail
the
cement
plant
by
demanding
a
multimillion
dollar
plant
to
be
shut
down
over
in
damages
and
required
the
plant
to
pay
the
plaintiffs
the
to
make
them
whole
the
plant
would
never
have
been
shut
down
the
plaintiffs
lawyers
would
have
just
negotiated
a
windfall
settlement
because
the
plaintiffs
would
prefer
an
amount
greater
than
k
to
having
the
plant
shut
down
while
the
plant
would
prefer
any
amount
less
than
the
value
of
the
plant
to
have
the
plant
continue
in
operation
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
okay
now
heres
my
interpretation
of
boomer
based
on
the
facts
as
presented
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
holding
boomer
v
note
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
the
highest
court
in
new
york
state
while
the
united
states
and
of
the
fifty
states
call
their
highest
court
supreme
court
supreme
judicial
court
or
supreme
court
of
appeals
maryland
and
new
york
call
theirs
simply
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
matters
worse
new
york
also
calls
its
secondhighest
court
the
supreme
court

et

owned

near

plant
near
albany
ny
the
fact
pattern
gives
no
information
as
to
which
came
first
the
plaintiffs
acquisition
of
the
land
or
he
defendants
start
of
production
at
their
cement
plant
in
the
course
of
its
regular
operations
the
cement
plant
did
injury
to
the
plaintiffs
property
via
dirt
smoke
and
vibrations
emanating
from
the
plant
the
plaintiffs
sought
injunctive
relief
that
is
they
asked
the
court
to
order
atlantic
cement
to
stop
damaging
their
property
commentary
this
seems
entirely
reasonable
to
me
boomer
at
al
owned
their
property
and
presumably
a
right
to
quiet
enjoyment
of
it
atlantic
cements
actions
were
depriving
boomer
et
al
of
that
right
instead
of
granting
the
plaintiffs
request
for
an
injunction
the
court
ordered
them
to
accept
the
damage
being
done
to
their
property
provided
that
atlantic
cement
paid
them
in
compensatory
damages
in
other
words
the
court
granted
atlantic
cement
co
a
private
party
the
power
and
authority
to
take
the
plaintiffs
rights
to
quiet
enjoyment
of
their
property
by
eminent
domain
a
taking
by
eminent
domain
is
always
problematical
even
when
its
done
by
the
state
allowing
a
private
firm
to
do
it
is
in
my
opinion
totally
wrong
yes
i
know
the
boomer
court
didnt
call
it
eminent
domain
but
if
it
walks
like
eminent
domain
and
swims
like
eminent
domain
and
quacks
like
eminent
domain
let
me
take
issue
with
the
way
youve
presented
the
case
you
say
that
what
happened
in
boomer
was
that
the
judge
didnt
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
blackmail
the
cement
plant
by
demanding
a
multimillion
dollar
plant
to
be
shut
down
over
in
damages
blackmail
pulls
out
blacks
law
dictionary
abridged
th
edition
blackmail
unlawful
demand
of
money
or
property
under
threat
to
do
bodily
harm
to
injure
property
to
accuse
of
crime
or
to
expose
disgraceful
defects
this
crime
is
commonly
included
under
extortion
statutes
how
do
you
define
as
blackmail
one
partys
act
of
demanding
the
right
to
set
its
own
sale
price
for
a
unique
piece
of
property
which
it
owns
and
which
another
party
has
expressed
an
interest
in
buying
or
of
demanding
the
right
not
to
sell
that
property
at
any
price
as
i
see
it
boomer
et
al
having
found
themselves
in
the
fortunate
position
of
owning
something
which
atlantic
cement
had
to
purchase
if
it
wanted
to
stay
in
business
had
every
right
in
the
world
to
set
whatever
price
they
wanted
there
isnt
or
at
least
shouldnt
be
any
law
that
says
that
you
have
to
be
a
nice
guy
in
your
private
business
dealings
you
go
on
to
say
the
plant
would
never
have
been
shut
down
the
plaintiffs
lawyers
would
have
just
negotiated
a
windfall
settlement
because
the
plaintiffs
would
prefer
an
amount
greater
than
k
to
having
the
plant
shut
down
while
the
plant
would
prefer
any
amount
less
than
the
value
of
the
plant
to
have
the
plant
continue
in
operation
if
so
so
what
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
preventing
parties
from
reaping
windfall
settlements
from
other
parties
when
those
settlements
arise
from
wrongful
acts
by
those
other
parties
if
atlantic
cement
didnt
want
to
have
to
face
a
choice
between
paying
a
windfall
settlement
or
going
out
of
business
well
shouldnt
atlantic
cement
have
thought
of
that
before
going
into
business
i
note
that
as
far
as
the
facts
show
boomer
et
al
were
not
the
parties
responsible
for
bringing
about
this
situation
that
was
atlantic
cements
own
fault
for
choosing
to
build
and
operate
the
type
of
plant
they
did
where
and
when
they
did
and
then
you
say
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
as
above
i
dispute
your
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
they
were
in
fact
by
court
action
deprived
of
their
rights
as
owners
of
property
to
choose
to
sell
or
not
sell
that
property
at
a
price
acceptable
to
them
and
for
that
deprivation
they
were
not
made
whole
and
again
i
ask
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
unnecessary
settlement
costs
are
avoided
if
so
ive
been
miseducated
i
always
thought
that
the
courts
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
justice
is
done
is
boomer
really
being
taught
as
infamous
thats
really
sad
if
it
is
because
i
fail
to
see
how
its
less
than
completely
sensible
you
should
read
the
law
and
economics
stuff
firsthand
instead
of
filtered
through
teachers
who
clearly
dont
like
it
for
whatever
inexplicable
reasons
boomer
is
not
being
taught
as
infamous
at
least
not
at
my
school
aside
northeastern
law
usually
does
a
very
good
job
of
hiring
for
their
firstyear
mandatory
classes
such
as
torts
where
i
first
encountered
boomer
instructors
who
regardless
of
their
personal
opinions
can
and
do
teach
the
law
neutrally
when
the
students
get
into
their
second
and
third
years
in
which
the
students
a
can
pick
and
choose
which
courses
to
take
except
for
the
mandatory
professional
responsibility
of
course
and
b
are
presumed
to
be
a
bit
more
worldly
and
selfconfident
less
likely
to
be
consciously
or
subconsciously
intimidated
by
law
school
professors
and
able
to
learn
from
openly
biased
instructors
rather
than
be
indoctrinated
by
them
the
instructors
tend
to
be
more
open
in
expressing
their
own
opinions
this
is
especially
true
of
parttime
instructors
who
in
real
life
are
practicing
attorneys
or
sitting
judges
this
can
be
very
educational
sometimes
far
more
so
than
being
taught
by
a
somewhat
cloistered
scholar
end
of
aside
i
called
it
infamous
because
thats
my
opinion
of
it
for
the
reasons
ive
stated
above
i
believe
it
to
be
a
triumph
of
something
that
i
can
only
call
economic
correctness
over
justice
it
is
completely
sensible
only
if
you
believe
that
the
alleged
right
of
the
owners
of
atlantic
cement
to
stay
in
business
and
avoid
losing
a
lot
of
their
own
money
due
to
their
own
wrongful
act
and
the
alleged
right
of
several
hundred
atlantic
cement
employees
to
not
have
their
jobs
disappear
should
trump
the
rights
of
people
who
own
property
which
was
damaged
by
atlantic
cements
wrongful
acts
and
if
you
believe
that
it
is
correct
for
the
courts
or
any
other
branch
of
government
to
grant
to
private
parties
the
right
to
take
other
peoples
property
by
eminent
domain
youd
like
posner
bill
hes
a
libertarian
really
i
didnt
know
that
what
if
anything
has
he
had
to
say
about
cases
like
boomer
of
course
he
has
too
much
of
a
paper
trail
to
ever
be
nominated
by
a
president
democrat
wont
like
his
antitrust
stance
or
republican
wont
like
his
support
of
gay
marriage
and
if
bright
law
students
shiver
at
what
they
dont
understand
its
easy
to
imagine
how
the
press
will
play
it
up
as
babyselling
ive
seen
mike
godwin
claim
that
posner
asserts
that
law
and
economics
is
applicable
to
everything
and
is
the
endall
and
beall
when
posner
says
precisely
the
opposite
so
it
goes
ive
admitted
that
my
understanding
of
the
field
generally
referred
to
as
law
and
economics
is
weak
if
it
advocates
the
use
of
economical
analysis
as
one
of
many
tiebreaker
factors
which
courts
may
use
to
help
them
reach
decisions
in
cases
in
which
the
dispute
as
measured
by
the
scale
of
justice
is
evenly
balanced
fine
but
as
illustrated
by
boomer
it
is
not
fine
when
the
courts
start
viewing
the
economics
of
a
case
as
being
more
important
than
the
justice
of
a
case
