speaking
of
vat
did
anyone
see
cnns
report
yesterday
it
was
quite
hillarious
no
pun
intended
they
ran
down
how
a
percent
tax
was
added
at
each
stage
of
manufacturing
graphicaly
depicting
a
stack
of
quarters
being
added
at
each
wholesale
stage
when
they
got
to
the
final
stage
the
actual
retail
sale
the
small
stack
of
quarters
added
to
the
large
stack
already
there
was
said
to
be
the
amount
paid
by
consumers
in
other
words
they
completed
ignored
the
fact
that
at
each
stage
the
tax
would
of
course
be
passed
on
to
the
next
buyer
with
the
retail
consumer
paying
the
full
load
these
are

one
of
the
commentators
on
one
of
the
big
three
news
programs
described
the
vat
which
aint
a
sales
tax
as
a
tax
governments
love
i
was
even
surprised
he
got
the
reason
right
it
effectively
hides
the
majority
of
the
tax
the
consumer
has
to
pay
from
the
consumer
its
kind
of
like
they
do
with
cars
you
pay
far
more
for
automobile
taxes
than
most
people
realize
because
its
contained
in
two
dozen
different
taxes
everything
from
your
license
to
your
tires
to
your
gasoline
