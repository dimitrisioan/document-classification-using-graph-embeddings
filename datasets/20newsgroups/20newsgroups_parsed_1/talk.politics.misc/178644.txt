just
because
someone
is
gay
doesnt

they
have
no
morals
just
because
someone
is
heterosexual
doesnt

they
do
look

the

statistics
alone
prove
that
most
criminals
are
by

hetero
hmmm
what
statistics
are
these
can
you
offer
any
references
the
only
studies
ive
seen
indicate
a
higher
proportion
of
homosexuals
in
prison
than
in
the
general
population
but
i
dont
think
that
allows
for
the
default
you
refer
to
prison
is
not
a
normal
situation
but
i
havent
seen
anything
that
suggests
that
the
default
proportion
is
lower
than
in
the
general
population
although
it
seems
plausible
anyway
as
i
say
can
you
provide
any
references
is
this
an
arguement
against
or
for
or
simply
a
statement
of
agreeance
disagreeance
the
fact
that
there
are
more
homosexuals
in
prison
does
not
mean
that
homosexuals
are
immoral
and
more
liable
to
commit
crime
and
one
must
remember
that
prison
is
not
necessarily
a
reflection
of
the
type
of
people
who
are
criminals
what
are
the
statistics
for
unsolved
crime
this
posting
is
