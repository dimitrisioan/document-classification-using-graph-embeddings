i
wouldnt
worry
too
much
about
it
though
we
are
starting
to
find
out
how
politically
impotent
homosexuals
really
are
nonrelevant
stuff
deleted
and
coming
this
saturday
they
are
going
to
wind
up
with
tremendous
egg
on
their
face
when
i
submit
no
more
than
perhaps
queers
will
show
up
in
washington
while
they
are
promising
crowds
in
the
millions
and
most
of
the
ones
who
will
be
there
will
look
like
actup
and
queer
nation
not
the
guy
working
in
the
next
cubicle
as
if
thats
really
going
to
play
in
middle
america
how
wrong
you
will
be
i
participated
in
the
last
national
march
on
washington
mow
for
lesgaybi
rights
oct
with
a
turnout
of
about
people
and
we
didnt
have
alot
pissing
us
off
at
the
time
the
big
issue
was
the
aids
crisis
but
we
werent
being
slapped
around
quite
as
bad
as
we
are
now
this
time
its
aids
and
equal
rights
and
the
military
squabble
and
this
mow
has
been
in
the
planning
for
years
whereas
the
last
one
was
pulled
together
in
a
relatively
short
time
the
last
mow
was
the
largest
ever
on
dc
and
you
can
bet
we
are
going
to
exceed
that
by
a
long
shot
i
truly
believe
we
will
exceed
the
million
goal
the
mow
committee
has
always
had
set
for
this
event
