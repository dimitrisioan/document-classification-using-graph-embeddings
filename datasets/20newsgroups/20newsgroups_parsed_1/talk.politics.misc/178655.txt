what
was
the
purpose
of
this
post
if
it
was
to
show
a
mindless
obsession
with
statistics
an
incredibly
flawed
system
of
reasoning
and
a
repellent
hatemonger
agenda
then
the
purpose
was
accomplished
with
panache

yes
you
are
when
you
and
the
rest
of
the
homosexual
community
pass
laws
to
impose
your
moral
codes
on
me
by
requiring
me
to
hire
rent
to
or
otherwise
associate
with
a
homosexual
against
my
will
yes
you
are
in
my
face
until
homosexuals
stop
trying
to
impose
their
morals
on
me
i
will
be
in
your
face
about
this
gosh
i
have
to
associate
with
heterosexuals
against
my
will
every
day
that
means
youve
imposed
your
moral
codes
on
me
now
doesnt
it
fortunately
i
have
taken
the
time
to
get
to
know
some
members
of
the
het
community
and
discovered
that
hey
they
really
arent
all
evil
elitists
with
no
concept
of
reality
ive
got
a
few
clues
for
you
a
im
not
working
to
pass
any
laws
b
our
morals
are
your
morals
i
imagine
you
value
freedom
so
do
we
if
you
value
your
own
freedom
you
must
necessarily
accept
that
these
laws
are
important
to
protect
it
after
all
discriminate
in
one
area
and
youre
open
to
discriminate
in
the
rest
c
i
suggest
learning
a
bit
more
about
gays
lesbians
and
bis
before
you
post
the
kind
of
drivel
you
have
been
its
obvious
that
you
havent
a
clue
who
youre
talking

relations

at
all
but
not
between
members

sex
right
how
can
you
live
with
such
hypocrisy
