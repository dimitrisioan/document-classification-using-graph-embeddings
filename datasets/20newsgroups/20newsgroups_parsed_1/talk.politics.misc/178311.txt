i
remain
prochoice
but
when
prochoicers
compare
abortion
in
a
clinic
to
a
religious
ritual
in
a
church
you
have
to
start
wondering
a
bit
if
the
prolife
criticism
of
abortion
as
modern
human
sacrifice
doesnt
have
a
grain
of
truth
to
it
in
article

ah
clayton
so
i
see
that
you
have
found
someone
new
to
bash
tell
me
how
many
prochoicers
have
compared
abortion
in
a
clinic
to
a
religious
ritual
in
a
church
ill
bet
that
youve
seen
overwhelming
support
for
this
opinion
in
some
newsgroup
or
another
in
article

no
but
ive
seen
the
comparison
drawn
by
prochoicers
in
capolitics
it
is
worrisome
to
me
but
not
to
you
ive
been
reading
capolitics
for
a
while
now
and
i
dont
recall
seeing
such
a
comparison
you
dont
read
my
postings
very
carefully
im
not
surprised
it
was
pretty
shocking
and
is
part
of
why
my
sympathy
though
not
agreement
with
the
prolifers
is
increasing
a
handful
of
lunatic
opinions
expressed
in
capolitics
does
not
make
me
think
that
the
opinion
is
widely
held
when
did
i
say
that
it
was
clayton
i
wish
i
knew
what
made
you
tick
your
math
sucks
and
you
take
single
instances
of
fringe
opinions
and
proclaim
the
existence
of
a
pernicious
trend
theres
about
a
quarter
billion
people
living
in
this
country
some
small
number
of
them
are
almost
guaranteed
to
hold
opinions
that
you
and
i
find
positively
repellent
as
long
as
the
small
number
is
truly
a
small
number
and
as
long
as
theyre
not
my
neighbor
highly
likely
im
not
worried
about
it
when
they
hold
high
public
office
you
should
worry
by
the
way
when
you
cite
experts
remember
that
carl
sagan
and
paul
ehrlich
sp
are
experts
too
if
ive
never
heard
of
your
experts
ill
consider
the
source
you
a
man
who
is
clearly
unable
to
master
elementary
statistics
and
uses
of
statistical
inference
and
ignore
them
david
chase
you
mean
i
dont
come
to
the
conclusions
that
your
emotional
state
requires
clayton
e
cramer
uunetpyramidoptilinkcramer
my

all
mine

between

not
