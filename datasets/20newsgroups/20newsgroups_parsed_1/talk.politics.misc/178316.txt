think
about
it
shouldnt
all
drugs
then
be
legalized
it
would
lower
the
cost
and
definitely
make
them
safer
to
use
yes
i
dont
think
we
want
to
start
using
these
criterion
to
determine
legality
why
not
where
do
they
get
these
people
what
pray
tell
does
this
mean
just
who
exactly
is
they
you
mean
they
as
in
people
who
do
not
blindly
swallow
every
piece
of
propoganda
they
are
given
or
they
as
in
nokd
not
our
kind
dear
or
they
as
in
an
appeal
to
some
audience
that
is
supposed
to
implicitly
know
and
understand
i
really
dont
want
to
waste
time
in
here
to
do
battle
about
the
legalization
of
drugs
if
you
really
want
to
we
can
get
into
it
and
prove
just
how
idiotic
that
idea
is
read
i
do
not
know
what
the
fuck
im
talking
about
and
am
not
eager
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
my
point
was
that
it
is
pretty
stupid
to
justify
legalizing
something
just
because
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
from
a
pragmatic
standpoint
there
certainly
is
some
justification
if
it
is
a
vice
people
will
commit
anyway
shall
we
criminalize
alcohol
again
if
the
relegalization
for
alcohol
were
done
from
anything
other
than
the
pragmatic
standpoint
id
be
happy
to
hear
about
it
the
fact
is
that
it
wasnt
a
few
more
ideas
to
hold
to
these
criterion
prostitution
the
killing
of
all
funny
farm
patients
aids
victims
elderly
unemployed
prisioners
etc
this
would
surely
make
my
taxes
decrease
only
the
first
one
make
any
sense
there
is
nothing
to
legalize
about
all
the
rest
just
in
case
you
havent
made
the
connection
which
i
expect
you
havent
the
connecting
theme
in
this
thread
is
a
persons
autonomy
over
their
life
and
body
vice
statutes
serve
only
to
make
it
more
expensive
for
the
rich
and
more
dangerous
for
the
poor
as
tim
so
eloquently
put
it
people
will
however
take
autonomy
over
their
lives
regardless
of
what
the
government
says
and
why
pray
tell
is
aids
victim
in
snear
quotes
are
you
of
the
revisionist
sort
that
thinks
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
aids
plauge
or
do
they
just
deserve
it
