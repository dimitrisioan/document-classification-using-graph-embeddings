subject
re
a
rational
viewpoint
was
re
new
study
out
on
gay
percentage
in
article
writes
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
young
person
to
develop
and
build
a
positive
view
of
themself
when
they
are
constantly
being
told
implicitly
and
explicitly
that
they
are
wrong
and
immoral
yes
that
is
most
certainly
true
however
the
paragrapgh
reflects
a
valueless
position
and
infers
that
what
is
more
important
than
anything
else
is
to
have
a
positive
view
of
ones
self
this
of
course
is
foolish
should
a
mass
murderer
a
pedophile
a
year
old
pyromaniac
have
a
positive
view
of
themselves
of
course
not
a
person
that
engages
in
behaviour
that
a
large
number
of
people
condemn
and
if
you
believe
in
the
concept
of
society
then
your
only
choice
is
to
expect
that
person
to
have
a
negative
view
of
themselves
there
are
actually
people
that
still
believe
love
canal
was
some
kind
of
environmental
disaster
weird
eh
these
opinions
are
mine
and
you
cant
have
em
but
ill
rent
em
cheap
