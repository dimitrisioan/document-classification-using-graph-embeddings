there
is
a
big
difference
between
running
ones
business
affairs
and
actively
ripping
people
off
and
charging
homosexuals
more
becuase
people
think
that
aids
is
a
gay
disease
is
actively
ripping
people
off
really
i
thought
that
insurance
companies
hired
all
of
their
actuarial
staffs
to
determine
the
risks
correlated
with
all
groups
of
people
and
that
gays
are
more
likely
to
have
aids
than
are
those
of
other
sexual
orientations
if
i
am
wrong
about
this
correlation
please
correct
me
my
auto
insurance
company
charges
me
up
the
wazoo
because
i
am
a
young
male
with
a
very
high
performance
car
i
always
thought
that
this
was
based
on
nhtsa
and
other
statistical
data
rather
than
bigotry
and
hatred
for
young
men
with
fast
cars
of
course
with
the
proper
government
intervention
we
could
force
the
insurance
companies
to
pretend
that
young
men
with
fast
cars
are
just
the
same
as
everyone
else
