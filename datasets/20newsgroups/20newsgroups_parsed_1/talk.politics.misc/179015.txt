in

an
earlier

the

equivalent
to
the

currently

levels
set
at
approx
ppm
in

years
it
has
never
gone
above
this
info
was
found
using
ice
core

from
the
joint

furthermore
the

good
evidence
the
ozone
hole
in
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
keeps
getting
bigger
and
stickin
around
longer
whilst
skeptics
ponder
how
wrong
or
corrupt
all
this
data
from
government
and
international
scientific
institutions
is
it
is
a
pity
that
if
the
skeptics
are
wrong
and
we
base
our
complacency
on
their
limbaugh
psycho
babble
then
we
will
find
ourselves
strapped
by
limited
options
with
which
to
rectify
the
primal
engineering
of
our
industrial
age
what
ozone
hole
in
the
northern

what
exactly
will
happen
if
we
get
an
ozone
hole
in
the
upper
atmosphere
according
to
the

at

as
much
more
uv
radiation
as
if
one
moved
miles
south
certainly
not
the
calamity
that
is
being
imagined
by
ecolunatics
co
is
going
up
so
what
theres
no
evidence
that
the
increase
is
due
to
burning
fossil
fuels
no
evidence
that
increasing

will
increase
temperatures
and
no
evidience
that
raising

will
do
anything
but
goodie
make
