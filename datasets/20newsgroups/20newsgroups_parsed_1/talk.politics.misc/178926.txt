for
those
who
still
doubt
what
is
going
on
this
is
from
the
still
uncensored
ap
wire
two
journalists
from
houston
arrested
at
gunpoint
and
cuffed
and
jailed
for
taking
pictures
of
the
compound
today
later
released
on
bail
but
cameras
and
film
were
confiscated
jh
you
could
work
for
cnn
take
a
few
lines
from
a
story
and
imply
something
with
it
but
dont
say
what
you
really
mean
the
police
always
close
off
the
area
around
a
major
crime
scene
to
keep
evidence
from
being
disturbed
by
taking
pictures
they
leave
foot
prints
they
may
drop
some
trash
on
the
ground
and
they
may
pick
up
something
that
looks
interesting
and
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
enter
the
closed
off
area
one
of
the
photographers
also
quickly
spun
around
with
a
long
lens
camera
while
the
officer
was
approaching
a
good
way
to
get
shot
well
that
hopefully
depends
on
what
country
one
is
in
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
country
you
are
coming
toward
someone
in
an
area
where
there
has
been
violent
confrontations
and
one
guy
spins
around
quickly
with
an
object
that
looks
like
a
gun
police
are
not
trained
to
stand
there
and
let
someone
gun
them
down
there
was
also
no
indication
in
that
story
that
they
wouldnt
get
their
cameras
and
film
back
after
getting
out
of
jail
once
goverment
agents
have
had
an
opportunity
to
check
the
film
out
youre
making
statements
that
are
not
supported
by
facts
dont
let
paranoia
get
the
best
of
you
wait
to
see
if
the
reporters
dont
get
their
film
back
or
they
get
it
back
developed
before
screaming
conspiracy
i
think
it
was
barry
goldwater
who
once
said
the
goverment
that
is
big
enough
to
give
you
everything
is
big
enough
to
take
everything
from
you
you
life
andor
freedom
including
of
course
that
could
not
happen
to
you
could
it
our
government
is
not
big
enough
to
give
you
everything
despite
the
efforts
of
people
like
bill
clinton
taking
a
statement
like
that
and
thinking
everything
done
in
the
name
of
law
enforcement
is
wrong
is
simple
minded
and
ignorant
of
history
a
government
is
a
necessary
evil
and
we
must
decide
what
it
should
be
allowed
to
do
based
on
facts
history
and
not
by
baseless
claims
