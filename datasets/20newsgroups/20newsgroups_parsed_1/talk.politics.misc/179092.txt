they
raided
an
americans
property
because
of
rumors
about
koreshs
intentions
with
some
converted
yet
still
ndamendment
protected
firearms
a
judgeapproved
warrant
justifies
nothing
in
a
democracy
under
the
rule
of
law
a
search
warrant
justifies
a
search
and
this
search
procedure
must
also
follow
the
rule
of
law
the
us
constitution
does
not
justify
murder
of
those
attempting
to
mount
a
search
for
illegally
held
weapons
it
may
if
necessary
when
the
search
is
executed
in
an
illegal
and
violent
fashion
the
govt
has
a
right
to
use
lethal
force
in
certain
cases
attempts
to
capture
dangerous
criminals
who
are
armed
and
threatening
the
lives
of
others
is
one
these
criminals
were
threatening
the
lives
of
no
one
they
were
fired
on
first
according
to
a
number
of
accounts
in
this
case
they
used
sub
lethal
force
wrong
firing
a
gun
at
someone
is
lethal
force
even
if
no
one
is
hit
of
course
they
did
hit
and
kill
people
the
children
were
held
hostage
the
adults
were
wanted
variously
for
murder
and
conspiracy
to
murder
you
are
silly
there
are
no
such
warrants
in
existence
phill
it
took
hundreds
of
govt
agents
with
taxfunded
cellular
phones
ten
minutes
to
dial
for
the
fire
department
they
should
not
have
called
the
fire
dept
at
all
there
was
no
role
for
them
to
play
in
a
situation
where
those
that
might
be
rescued
might
well
shoot
at
them
calling
the
fire
dept
meant
that
waco
was
deprived
of
a
resource
that
might
have
been
needed
elsewhere
should
a
situation
where
it
could
have
been
used
arisen
thanks
phill
for
another
example
of
that
great
socialist
sensitivity
obey
the
government
or
die
plonk

you
