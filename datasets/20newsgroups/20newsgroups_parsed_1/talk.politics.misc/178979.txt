how
many
homosexuals
are
there

writes
perhaps
but
most
likely
not
more
than
a
new
study
discrediting
kinsey
says
so
the
views
expressed
herein
are
theodore

kaldis
my
own
only
do
you
seriously
believe
that
a
major
university
rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
as
this
would
hold
such
views
my
understanding
from
my
psycology
classes
is
that
the
percentage
is
more
like
world
wide
i
would
really
like
to
know
your
source
for
the
figure
riyadh
moosa
sdsuchemistry
some
survey
conducted
by
the
us
government
and
some
group
i
dont
know
which
did
what
they
were
calling
on
all
the
news
shows
this
morning
the
most
comprehensive
survey
of
sexuality
in
the
past
years
not
an
exact
quote
but
you
get
the
idea
this
low
percentage
is
merely
one
more
in
a
ton
of
evidence
disproving
the
theory
