slavery
makes
economic
sense
it
never
makes
moral
sense
when
human
muscle
power
is
an
economically
valuable
asset
agricultural
slavery
might
have
lasted
right
up
to
the
first
mechanical
cotton
reaper
but
no
further
reapers
are
cheaper
than
slaves
and
dont
have
to
be
fed
during

this
argument
makes
a
several
fundamental
errors
first
agricultural
slavery
was
not
limited
to
production
of
cotton
in
the
american
south
slave
labor
was
used
extensively
to
grow
tobacco
sugar
and
rice
all
of
which
remained
labor
intensive
enterprises
well
into
the
th
century
and
of
course
in
states
like
kentucky
and
virginia
not
wellsuited
to
largescale
plantations
slave
labor
was
used
to
make
one
of
the
most
valuable
agricultural
products
of
all
more
slaves
in
some
ways
this
treatment
of
humans
beings
as
breeding
livestock
is
the
most
horrifying
aspect
of
american
slavery
second
although
mechanization
of
cotton
production
could
be
expected
to
reduce
the
demands
for
labor
eventually
it
was
only
in
the
s
the
mechanization
of
cotton
production
in
the
south
largely
eliminated
the
labor
intensive
character
of
the
operation
long
after
the
first
mechanical
cotton
reaper
was
invented
this
is
an
interesting
question
