well
the
obvious
point
to
make
is
would
straight
men
fuck
like
rabbits
if
the
oppertunity
presented
itself
i
reckon
any
man
would
go
wildly
promiscuous
if
presented
with
a
huge
variety
of
willing
partners
if
true
and
if
gays
were
the
same
as
straights
except
for
sexual
preference
i
would
imagine
that
gays
would
have
much
less
sex
than
straights
because
the
available
pool
for
dates
is
less
than
onetenth
what
it
is
for
straights
somebody
correct
flame
me
please
i
can
not
believe
i
am
posting
in
this
thread
but
what
the
hell
he
asked
for
it
i
had
sort
of
the
same
reaction
myself
when
i
was
first
realizing
i
was
bi
so
what
of
everyone
else
is
straight
id
never
end
up
with
a
guy
anyway
as
several
people
on
socbi
pointed
out
to
me
this
is
true
only
if
you
find
partners
for
relationships
or
just
for
sex
in
primarily
straight
circles
nowadays
with
gay
culture
quite
visible
in
major
cities
and
such
you
can
easily
find
yourself
in
an
overwhelmingly
queer
social
circle
if
you
so
choose
about
half
my
friends
are
bi
and
thats
just
from
hanging
out
in
the
science
fiction
club
and
going
to
ucbu
once
a
week
its
not
as
if
i
have
to
go
out
of
my
way
and
hang
out
in
bars
or
something
so
the
available
pool
for
dates
can
be
the
same
size
unless
of
course
youre
trying
to
date
a
random
sample
of
the
us
population
as
for
promiscuity
ive
traded
email
with
clayton
on
the
topic
and
he
still
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
admit
that
yes
gay
males
are
sometimes
forced
to
resort
to
anonymous
sex
because
theyre
closeted
and
cant
afford
to
be
seen
in
a
permanent
relationship
or
that
part
of
the
promiscuity
is
because
of
the
messedup
gender
roles
in
our
society
and
when
males
are
dating
males
and
theyve
all
been
trained
to
be
the
aggressor
in
sex
theres
going
to
be
more
sex
or
that
whats
dysfunctional
whats
screwed
up
is
societal
attitudes
not
gay
sexuality
and
thats
what
encourages
deviant
behavior
in
gay
males
also
note
that
just
because
someones
had
sex
partners
doesnt
mean
theyre
promiscuous
yes
it
sounds
ridiculous
but
its
quite
possible
for
someone
to
go
through
a
heavily
closeted
phase
in
which
they
have
lots
of
anonymous
sex
with
strangers
and
then
come
out
start
forming
real
relationships
and
be
monogamous
or
nearly
so
alan
jaffray
email
talk
always
welcome
bi
those
who
dance
are
thought
mad
by
those
who
hear
not
the
music
