says
im
no
defender
of
the
aec
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
it
is
unfair
to
tar
that
organization
with
the
decidedly
minority
scientific
views
of
its
former
chairperson
and
one
term
washington
governor
dr
dixie
lee
ray
dr
rays
political
agenda
is
wellknown
and
documented
likewise
her
lack
of
objectivity
in
analysing
scientific
data
is
wellknown
you
are
correct
i
apologize
my
problems
with
the
aec
are
their
however
inherent
continuous
barage
of
misleading
data
in
order
to
support
the
statement
that
nuclear
is
not
only
safe
and
clean
but
cheap
to
boot
to
cents
per
kilowatt
hour
is
not
cheap
and
neither
are
nuclear
power
plants
as
far
as
being
safe
and
clean
ill
let
nuclear
power
plants
speak
for
themselves
all
the
way
from
the
uranium
mines
to
their
decommisioning
