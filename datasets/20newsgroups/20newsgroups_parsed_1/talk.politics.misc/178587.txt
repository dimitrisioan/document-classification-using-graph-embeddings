writes
these
two
paragraphs
are
from
two
different
posts
in
splicing
them
together
it
is
not
my
intention
to
change
steves
meaning
or
misrepresent
him
in
any
way
i
dont
think
ive
done
so
as
noted
in
another
thread
limiting
govt
the
problem
libertarians
face
is
insuring
that
the
limited
government
they
seek
does
not
become
the
tool
of
private
interests
to
pursue
their
own
agenda
it
is
a
failure
of
libertarianism
if
the
ideology
does
not
provide
any
reasonable
way
to
restrain
such
actions
other
than
utopian
dreams
just
as
marxism
fails
to
specify
how
pure
communism
is
to
be
achieved
and
the
state
is
to
wither
away
libertarians
frequently
fail
to
show
how
weakening
the
power
of
the
state
will
result
in
improvement
in
the
human
condition
part
of
what
started
this
was
my
earlier
example
of
illinois
usa
requiring
anyone
doing
more
than
x
automobile
transfers
a
year
x
i
think
to
become
licensed
as
a
used
car
dealer
in
addition
it
requirs
anyone
with
a
used
car
dealers
license
to
own
at
least
cars
at
a
time
all
the
time
let
me
continue
with
this
example
and
try
to
answer
steves
questions
steve
lets
say
you
have
the
talent
and
inclination
to
fix
up
and
resell
cars
either
youve
gotten
good
enough
at
it
in
your
spare
time
to
bump
up
against
these
limits
or
you
would
like
to
do
it
fulltime
but
these
stupid
arbitrary
laws
prevent
you
from
starting
out
small
and
pulling
yourself
up
so
im
protected
from
a
hungry
neighborhood
competitor
willing
to
take
a
low
profit
while
working
extra
hard
to
fulfill
my
needs
and
youre
protected
from
doing
what
you
want
with
your
life
heres
what
i
see
libertarianism
offering
you
your
money
is
truly
yours
it
belongs
to
you
you
can
use
it
to
buy
a
car
if
you
use
it
to
buy
a
car
it
is
truly
your
car
it
belongs
to
you
you
can
use
your
money
to
fix
up
that
car
since
it
is
your
car
you
can
sell
that
car
your
life
is
truly
yours
it
belongs
to
you
it
matters
not
if
someone
thinks
that
its
wrong
for
you
to
buy
and
sell
cars
within
months
rather
than
say
cars
they
may
dissaprove
but
it
is
not
their
life
or
their
money
it
is
your
life
and
your
money
my
money
is
truly
mine
it
belongs
to
me
i
can
use
it
to
buy
a
car
perhaps
your
car
perhaps
that
th
car
the
one
that
someone
somewhere
dissaproves
of
you
selling
and
presumably
of
me
buying
that
someone
could
go
to
the
government
and
insist
that
the
government
make
us
stop
it
but
the
government
would
be
powerless
to
stop
us
from
doing
what
we
like
with
our
own
property
in
the
abscence
of
fraud
or
agression
and
it
would
be
powerless
to
stop
us
from
associating
with
each
other
this
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
utopian
dream
but
basic
human
decency
and
common
sense
a
real
grassroots
example
of
freedom
and
liberty
and
yes
not
having
a
few
people
acting
as
our
masters
approving
or
rejecting
each
of
our
basic
transactions
with
each
other
does
strike
me
as
a
wonderful
way
to
improve
the
human
condition
thanks
awfully
patrick
