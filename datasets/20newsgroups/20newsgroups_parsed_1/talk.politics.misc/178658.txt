basically
i
think
this
tendency
for
non
african
americans
to
believe
that
something
is
wrong
with
us
exists
because
non
african
americans
dont
want
to
deal
with
the
possiblility
that
the
society
is
deeply
biased
against
african
americans
and
that
this
is
about
of
the
problem
there
is
something
terribly
wrong
however
with
a
culture
which
condemns
attacks
and
all
too
often
kills
any
of
its
members
who
attempt
to
get
an
education
my
mother
is
an
elementary
school
teacher
and
she
tells
me
that
she
and
her
african
american
collegues
are
frustrated
to
tears
by
the
fact
that
any
african
american
child
who
attempts
to
do
well
in
school
and
get
an
education
is
accused
by
hisher
peers
of
trying
to
be
white
and
is
beaten
bullied
and
tormented
by
them
it
goes
beyond
each
passing
grade
on
a
test
earning
a
beating
in
my
mothers
school
one
of
the
most
promising
young
students
who
happened
to
be
african
american
had
her
throat
cut
by
one
of
these
young
thugs
nobody
who
buys
into
such
a
culture
has
any
hope
of
being
anything
but
poor
andor
a
thug
andor
dead
regardless
of
their
color
what
has
to
be
changed
is
the
culture
if
that
culture
cant
be
changed
then
those
africanamerican
kids
who
are
willing
to
separate
from
it
must
be
separated
from
it
and
the
murderous
thugs
of
whatever
color
otherwise
future
bright
young
african
american
girls
who
wanted
to
be
doctors
will
end
up
dead
on
the
school
bus
lets
face
it
when
it
comes
to
utilities
microsoft
has
mike
van
pelt
performed
about
as
well
as
a
savings
and
loan
these
are
the
guys
remember
who
put
backup
and
restore
