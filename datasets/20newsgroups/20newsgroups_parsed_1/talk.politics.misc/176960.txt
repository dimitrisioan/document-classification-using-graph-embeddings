am
pst
folks
were
about
to
start
the
background
briefing
on
the
aid
package
senior
administration
official
good
morning
the
president
president
clinton
and
president
yeltsin
agreed
yesterday
on
a
series
of
american
initiatives
to
support
economic
and
political
reform
in
russia
and
its
valued
at
billion
before
taking
your
questions
and
running
through
the
basic
outlines
of
this
package
i
want
to
make
a
few
points
first
this
is
the
maximum
that
the
clinton
administration
can
do
with
available
funds
to
support
russian
reform
all
of
the
funds
have
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
there
is
no
need
for
the
administration
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
fund
any
of
these
programs
all
our
fiscal
year
funds
currently
are
available
so
in
effect
all
of
these
programs
can
begin
tomorrow
the
second
point
is
that
this
package
is
designed
to
support
russian
reformers
all
of
the
initiatives
in
the
package
are
directed
at
reformers
and
for
their
benefit
and
all
have
been
worked
out
with
prior
consultation
with
the
russian
government
third
the
president
is
determined
that
we
will
deliver
on
these
commitments
this
year
the
package
is
designed
to
maximize
our
ability
to
support
reform
in
designing
it
we
wanted
to
avoid
making
commitments
that
we
could
not
meet
and
we
feel
very
confident
that
we
can
meet
all
of
these
commitments
in
front
of
you
fourth
id
like
to
note
the
special
importance
of
trade
and
investment
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
russias
capital
and
technology
needs
throughout
the
next
decade
extend
well
into
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
no
collection
of
governments
can
meet
those
needs
only
the
private
sector
can
do
so
and
so
the
president
and
president
yeltsin
agreed
to
make
trade
and
investment
a
major
priority
in
the
relationship
they
also
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
new
joint
commission
on
energy
and
space
formed
headed
on
the
us
side
by
vice
president
gore
on
the
russian
side
by
prime
minister
chernomyrdin
and
the
goal
of
this
effort
is
to
break
through
the
barriers
to
trade
and
investment
on
both
sides
and
to
promote
a
vastly
expanded
relationship
if
it
would
be
helpful
id
be
prepared
to
run
down
the
first
page
which
is
a
summary
of
us
assistance
and
just
give
you
some
general
background
on
what
these
programs
are
ill
do
it
quickly
and
then
ill
be
glad
to
take
questions
the
first
group
of
initiatives
are
humanitarian
food
and
medical
assistance
this
is
part
of
our
effort
which
has
been
underway
for
several
years
to
provide
basic
humanitarian
grant
food
assistance
so
that
the
russian
government
can
assure
theres
at
least
a
minimal
amount
of
bread
on
the
shelves
in
the
major
cities
thats
million
in
grant
that
is
from
food
for
progress
the
grant
portion
of
food
for
progress
well
also
be
continuing
our
grant
assistance
in
medicines
and
pharmaceutical
supplies
and
thats
million
the
second
item
is
concessional
food
sales
as
you
know
the
united
states
has
had
a
longterm
grain
relationship
with
russia
its
important
to
us
and
its
important
to
russia
that
we
continue
that
relationship
the
president
has
chosen
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
concessional
loan
program
the
value
over
the
next
seven
months
is
million
these
are
concessional
terms
the
exact
terms
have
not
been
worked
out
but
i
think
its
fair
to
say
there
will
be
a
grace
period
on
principal
of
six
or
seven
years
and
concessional
rates
thereafter
for
the
life
of
the
deal
the
third
program
is
a
collection
of
private
sector
support
we
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
were
going
to
do
privatization
and
the
creation
of
small
businesses
is
the
number
one
priority
of
the
reform
government
in
moscow
and
so
the
president
has
decided
to
create
a
russianamerican
enterprise
fund
capitalized
this
year
at
million
and
the
goal
of
this
fund
is
to
make
direct
loans
to
small
businesses
in
russia
to
take
equity
positions
in
those
businesses
the
president
has
also
decided
to
create
a
privatization
fund
which
would
work
directly
with
the
russian
government
in
its
priority
objective
of
trying
to
convert
state
enterprises
from
a
stateowned
basis
to
a
private
basis
he
has
also
agreed
the
president
has
also
agreed
to
establish
a
eurasia
foundation
this
would
be
a
private
foundation
led
by
prominent
americans
to
fund
democratization
projects
in
russia
the
fourth
grouping
you
see
there
in
the
summary
page
is
democratization
itself
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
this
administration
has
given
a
new
impetus
to
the
goal
of
pursuing
democratization
in
russia
you
see
that
we
have
a
total
of
million
in
programs
various
programs
the
detailed
tables
give
an
indication
of
some
of
the
programs
that
were
launching
the
president
is
also
calling
for
the
development
of
a
democracy
corps
which
will
be
an
overarching
umbrella
group
to
try
to
incorporate
all
of
the
disparate
private
and
public
efforts
now
underway
from
the
united
states
to
support
reform
in
russia
the
fifth
program
you
see
is
russian
office
of
resettlement
this
is
a
new
initiative
created
and
conceptualized
by
this
administration
this
is
a
demonstration
project
what
wed
like
to
do
is
work
with
the
russian
military
to
help
resettle
russian
officers
returning
from
the
baltic
states
and
other
parts
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
work
out
the
best
way
to
do
that
whether
its
with
russian
labor
and
russian
materials
or
using
prefab
american
construction
and
so
weve
decided
to
fund
on
a
demonstration
basis
the
construction
of
housing
units
well
be
working
very
closely
with
the
russian
military
on
this
and
i
would
say
that
we
have
a
longterm
commitment
to
this
project
the
sixth
area
is
energy
in
the
environment
they
are
two
issues
that
the
president
feels
strongly
about
our
initial
efforts
will
be
feasibility
studies
to
look
into
the
possibility
of
enhancing
their
energy
production
both
oil
and
gas
and
equally
important
trying
to
cut
down
on
the
leakages
in
the
oil
and
gas
pipeline
systems
which
cause
so
much
environmental
damage
ive
talked
a
little
bit
about
trade
and
investment
about
the
new
group
being
created
that
the
vice
president
will
chair
on
our
side
secretary
ron
brown
will
also
be
cochairing
with
deputy
prime
minister
shohkin
a
business
development
committee
which
will
work
in
all
other
sectors
of
the
economy
to
break
down
the
many
barriers
that
currently
exist
and
impede
trade
and
investment
we
are
also
going
to
appoint
a
fulltime
investment
ombudsman
in
the
american
government
to
work
on
this
problem
fulltime
and
the
point
id
like
to
make
here
is
trade
and
investment
in
the
s
is
every
bit
as
important
to
draw
an
analogy
as
arms
reductions
was
in
the
s
and
s
and
we
just
thought
that
in
looking
at
this
we
needed
to
make
a
commitment
within
our
own
government
to
have
people
work
on
it
senior
people
on
a
fulltime
basis
because
it
is
terribly
important
youll
notice
that
the
united
states
is
going
to
support
russias
membership
in
the
gatt
russia
has
had
observer
status
russia
has
requested
our
support
and
in
fact
requested
our
advice
in
becoming
a
member
of
the
gatt
we
think
that
the
longterm
goal
of
drawing
russia
into
the
global
economy
is
paramount
a
very
important
goal
and
that
is
why
we
are
supporting
the
membership
in
the
gatt
we
are
also
supporting
their
access
to
gsp
the
generalized
system
of
preferences
youll
note
that
exim
has
extended
million
in
credit
for
a
caterpillar
deal
in
siberia
that
opic
has
extended
million
in
credits
and
loan
guarantees
for
a
conoco
oil
project
id
like
to
emphasize
that
we
are
very
close
to
an
agreement
between
russia
and
the
united
states
for
a
billion
framework
facility
through
the
exim
bank
that
would
finance
russian
purchases
of
american
oil
and
gas
equipment
and
services
we
think
this
is
a
very
important
development
we
think
well
get
there
by
april
th
which
is
the
opening
day
of
the
tokyo
conference
the
g
conference
before
i
take
any
further
questions
id
like
to
defer
to
my
colleague
who
will
review
the
security
assistance
objectives
with
you
senior
administration
official
our
major
unfinished
agenda
with
the
russians
and
with
their
counterparts
in
ukraine
kazakhstan
and
belarus
is
in
the
area
of
the
safe
and
secure
dismantlement
of
the
nuclear
arsenals
on
their
territory
under
the
terms
of
the
start
i
and
start
ii
agreements
recently
we
completed
in
moscow
three
i
think
very
important
agreements
that
devote
a
significant
chunk
of
nunnlugar
funding
to
three
important
programs
the
first
is
the
program
of
million
for
the
strategic
nuclear
delivery
vehicle
dismantlement
program
that
is
for
submarines
for
icbm
dismantlement
and
for
bomber
dismantlement
million
the
second
is
a
million
tranche
of
funding
for
the
construction
of
a
facility
to
store
nuclear
materials
removed
from
the
warheads
as
they
are
dismantled
this
will
essentially
contribute
to
the
overall
design
and
the
early
phases
of
the
construction
of
that
storage
facility
and
finally
a
million
tranche
of
money
to
help
in
the
establishment
of
a
monitoring
system
for
the
nuclear
materials
as
they
are
withdrawn
from
the
weapons
system
so
we
add
that
million
total
to
the
extant
nunnlugar
assistance
which
has
been
flowing
about
million
for
some
overall
safety
improvements
for
various
kinds
of
equipment
and
safety
measures
that
we
have
been
working
out
with
the
russians
over
the
last
couple
of
years
so
this
is
an
area
where
we
will
be
going
a
lot
more
work
with
not
only
the
russians
but
with
the
ukrainians
kazhaks
and
belarussians
belarus
for
example
has
just
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
received
up
to
million
in
fy
funds
for
safety
security
and
dismantlement
programs
on
belarussian
territory
and
this
was
in
the
wake
of
their
ratification
of
start
i
an
agreement
to
accede
to
npt
so
we
are
working
very
hard
with
all
the
parties
to
the
lisbon
protocols
and
will
continue
to
work
very
hard
with
them
and
i
look
upon
these
three
recent
agreements
with
russia
as
a
very
important
step
in
that
process
q
the
opic
funds
to
is
that
for
the
field
in
kazhakstan
and
conoco
already
signed
this
deal
with
kazhakstan
why
do
you
feel
now
it
is
necessary
if
its
the
same
one
why
do
you
feel
its
necessary
senior
administration
official
its
not
the
same
deal
chevron
signed
a
deal
with
kazhakstan
the
tenges
oil
field
this
is
a
new
investment
project
its
a
polar
lights
oil
development
and
renovation
project
and
its
being
announced
today
so
its
completely
new
q
can
you
tell
us
more
about
whats
involved
senior
administration
official
yes
conoco
like
other
american
oil
companies
has
been
searching
for
ways
to
do
two
things
one
to
prospect
for
new
oil
in
siberia
west
siberia
and
two
to
try
to
get
into
the
business
of
renovating
oil
wells
and
renovating
pipelines
both
oil
and
gas
in
russia
the
objective
here
obviously
is
to
take
advantage
of
the
natural
resources
in
russia
increase
energy
production
which
will
in
turn
increase
hard
currency
revenues
which
is
what
russia
needs
so
we
think
this
deal
is
very
very
good
development
for
russia
the
russians
do
as
well
and
its
good
for
an
american
company
and
the
american
government
has
played
a
leading
role
in
pulling
this
together
through
the
credit
facility
in
opic
and
through
the
loan
guarantee
q
so
its
to
search
and
also
to
renovate
fields
that
are
already
there
senior
administration
official
thats
right
q
on
that
point
should
other
american
companies
expect
to
get
administration
support
for
such
deals
or
should
they
now
go
to
the
exim
and
try
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
billion
senior
administration
official
well
as
you
know
exim
is
part
of
the
us
government
and
various
parts
of
the
us
government
have
been
pushing
including
the
state
department
and
the
white
house
for
this
deal
to
be
consummated
and
we
think
it
will
and
if
we
arrive
at
this
agreement
by
april
th
there
will
be
billion
in
financing
available
for
american
companies
to
sell
their
equipment
and
sell
their
services
q
that
should
take
up
all
of
the
rest
of
the
deals
and
their
wont
be
and
their
will
or
there
wont
be
support
for
opic
sort
of
deals
such
as
this
conoco
senior
administration
official
theres
a
tremendous
amount
of
interest
on
the
part
of
american
oil
and
gas
companies
to
invest
in
russia
we
think
that
the
exim
oil
and
gas
facility
the
billion
facility
once
it
is
concluded
will
soak
up
a
lot
of
that
interest
but
i
think
the
interest
may
even
extend
beyond
that
and
if
so
the
government
will
respond
q
whats
the
current
year
budget
costs
of
that
billion
agreement
should
it
go
forward
and
is
there
any
current
year
budget
costs
senior
administration
official
ill
have
to
refer
you
to
exim
for
that
i
dont
know
the
details
of
that
q
the
concessional
food
sales
is
there
any
current
year
costs
to
that
or
is
it
delayed
until
the
years
in
which
the
payments
are
due
senior
administration
official
the
concessional
food
sales
are
from
food
for
progress
which
is
a
usda
program
usda
has
the
funds
we
dont
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
expend
those
funds
there
will
be
a
hit
in
the
budget
id
refer
you
to
usda
and
omb
for
the
details
on
that
q
can
you
talk
about
the
democracy
corps
q
and
the
private
sector
how
many
folks
are
going
to
be
involved
in
that
senior
administration
official
why
dont
i
start
with
the
democracy
corps
first
i
think
the
administration
felt
coming
into
office
that
there
were
literally
thousands
of
organization
private
organizations
in
the
united
states
that
in
one
way
or
another
were
working
at
the
goal
of
trying
to
achieve
democratization
in
russia
helping
on
a
farmertofarmer
basis
and
there
were
literally
or
us
government
agencies
that
had
a
variety
of
programs
in
this
area
and
so
the
administration
felt
the
president
felt
it
was
important
to
try
to
draw
all
of
these
initiatives
together
under
one
group
to
give
some
coherence
to
the
efforts
and
to
give
some
impetus
to
the
efforts
and
so
this
is
a
presidential
initiative
it
will
be
headed
by
ambassador
tom
simons
who
will
soon
take
up
his
duties
as
the
coordinator
for
us
assistance
in
the
former
soviet
union
and
were
very
hopeful
that
we
might
use
this
democracy
corps
not
only
to
draw
upon
the
resources
of
our
own
government
but
the
resources
of
the
american
private
sector
and
schools
and
communities
across
the
nation
q
any
kind
of
commitment
yet
any
kind
of
word
yet
on
fy
and
any
new
money
that
needs
to
be
appropriated
besides
the
million
the
president
talked
about
senior
administration
official
the
administration
is
requesting
additional
funds
in
fy
of
million
what
the
president
has
done
this
weekend
is
to
consult
really
intensively
yesterday
with
president
yeltsin
about
additional
measures
the
united
states
could
take
in
some
of
these
areas
to
support
reform
hell
be
consulting
with
the
congress
when
he
returns
to
washington
hell
be
consulting
also
with
the
other
ally
governments
and
well
make
a
decision
at
that
time
q
two
questions
about
the
billion
agricultural
money
first
of
all
i
thought
it
was
the
sort
of
consensus
that
what
russia
did
not
need
was
more
loans
for
food
so
why
did
you
decide
to
do
it
that
way
secondly
could
you
explain
agriculture
has
been
stopped
from
making
further
loans
for
food
because
of
russias
inability
to
pay
how
does
this
fit
into
that
situation
senior
administration
official
as
you
know
the
united
states
for
a
long
time
has
been
a
major
supplier
of
grains
and
food
commodities
agricultural
products
to
russia
i
think
between
and
we
had
extended
a
little
bit
of
history
here
about
billion
in
credits
credit
guarantees
through
the
commodity
credit
corporation
that
was
the
principal
vehicle
to
ensure
the
sale
of
american
grain
products
on
december
of
last
year
the
russian
government
stopped
its
payments
on
that
program
they
are
now
in
arrears
to
us
on
that
program
and
therefore
by
law
the
united
states
can
not
continue
that
program
and
so
the
president
working
with
secretary
espy
and
other
officials
in
the
cabinet
looked
for
other
ways
that
we
could
promote
american
grain
sales
and
i
think
we
have
two
ways
to
do
that
weve
announced
today
million
in
grant
food
assistance
through
the
food
for
progress
program
but
we
do
not
have
sufficient
authority
to
spend
million
in
grant
food
and
so
we
looked
for
a
concessional
loan
program
i
think
everybody
agrees
that
russia
that
a
shortterm
loan
program
for
russia
would
not
make
sense
now
but
a
longterm
concessional
loan
program
would
and
that
is
what
this
program
is
it
will
provide
once
the
final
details
are
worked
out
for
a
six
to
sevenyear
grace
period
on
payments
of
principal
and
then
from
years
seven
through
which
is
the
life
of
the
deal
it
will
provide
for
concessional
rates
of
interest
generally
around
three
to
four
percent
and
so
we
believe
and
the
russian
government
believes
this
is
a
good
deal
for
them
because
it
will
avoid
the
imperative
of
early
payments
and
put
them
into
the
out
years
but
it
will
also
continue
this
very
important
grain
relationship
which
is
important
for
them
and
its
important
for
the
american
farm
community
q
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
this
could
make
it
explicit
the
russians
failure
to
pay
the
interest
on
ecc
loan
does
not
in
any
way
affect
this
kind
of
loan
going
through
is
that
right
senior
administration
official
let
me
be
explicit
about
that
we
are
prevented
under
the
law
to
from
continuing
the
commodity
credit
corporation
shortterm
credit
program
because
of
russias
arrearages
to
the
united
states
all
of
you
know
about
those
arrearages
they
total
about
i
think
around
million
usda
can
give
you
an
exact
figure
so
having
taken
that
into
consideration
and
wanting
to
preserve
american
market
share
and
a
longterm
grain
relationship
wanting
to
respond
to
a
specific
request
from
the
russian
government
for
major
food
assistance
knowing
that
we
couldnt
take
it
from
the
grant
programs
because
we
dont
have
sufficient
authority
there
we
looked
at
food
for
progress
which
is
a
program
weve
used
to
great
effect
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
we
consulted
with
the
russian
government
and
arrived
at
this
solution
i
think
the
russians
are
pleased
because
it
provides
them
with
the
food
but
also
gives
them
a
little
bit
of
relief
on
the
shortterm
payments
q
where
do
those
funds
actually
come
from
senior
administration
official
they
come
from
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
program
under
usdas
authority
usda
has
the
authority
to
spend
these
funds
we
do
not
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
for
these
funds
and
i
want
to
make
that
general
point
again
everything
in
this
package
the
billion
package
comprises
funds
that
have
already
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
the
administration
can
begin
to
spend
these
monies
tomorrow
and
its
very
important
in
our
eyes
that
we
expend
all
the
funds
this
year
that
we
meet
these
commitments
and
we
are
confident
well
be
able
to
do
so
q
how
did
you
arrive
at
the
figure
of
million
does
that
max
out
that
program
or
did
you
actually
have
a
range
from
to
senior
administration
official
theres
a
reason
for
it
the
reason
was
that
the
russian
government
told
us
thats
about
the
amount
of
grain
that
they
needed
between
now
and
harvest
time
and
so
the
idea
is
that
we
would
begin
the
shipments
probably
million
per
month
from
now
until
the
harvest
in
the
autumn
at
which
time
russia
wont
require
the
same
level
of
food
imports
from
the
west
q
i
would
imagine
theres
going
to
be
some
considerable
envy
and
jealousy
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
other
republics
because
of
the
size
and
the
scope
of
this
with
russia
have
you
given
any
consideration
to
advancing
negotiations
for
the
same
kinds
of
projects
with
the
ukraine
with
georgia
with
some
of
the
other
republics
senior
administration
official
yes
were
very
conscience
of
the
fact
that
we
also
have
an
interest
in
extending
american
support
to
the
other
countries
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
have
told
ourselves
and
we
have
planned
that
in
the
area
of
technical
assistance
the
grant
technical
assistance
that
you
see
roughly
percent
of
the
funding
will
go
to
russia
and
roughly
percent
to
the
other
countries
in
the
area
of
food
sales
we
have
been
active
with
ukraine
in
grant
food
assistance
with
georgia
and
armenia
we
will
continue
that
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
after
this
summit
we
will
go
back
and
look
at
all
of
our
programs
with
the
other
countries
to
ensure
that
they
are
adequate
and
they
are
productive
and
theyre
hardhitting
q
has
anything
happened
at
the
summit
to
lead
american
energy
companies
and
other
companies
to
believe
that
russia
is
going
to
be
more
userfriendly
toward
them
in
terms
of
taxing
legalities
bureaucracy
senior
administration
official
well
one
of
our
primary
objectives
coming
into
this
summit
was
to
highlight
not
only
the
economic
agenda
but
also
trade
and
investment
and
id
like
to
refer
to
the
point
i
made
at
the
beginning
were
convinced
in
talking
about
this
problem
the
problem
of
how
to
support
russia
longterm
were
convinced
that
no
collection
of
western
governments
have
the
financial
resources
over
the
next
decade
to
fuel
the
continuation
of
reform
that
only
the
private
sector
can
do
that
we
look
at
our
own
society
and
we
see
tremendous
capability
in
resources
in
the
oil
and
gas
sector
it
is
a
very
good
match
with
what
the
russians
need
now
which
is
financial
investment
in
the
existing
oil
and
gas
wells
and
pipeline
and
new
technology
and
new
capital
to
finance
new
production
thats
what
the
russian
government
has
told
us
it
wants
to
do
and
so
thats
why
we
have
made
such
a
major
emphasis
on
it
thats
why
trade
and
investment
was
a
prominent
issue
on
the
first
day
of
these
talks
and
in
fact
figured
prominently
last
night
in
the
meeting
between
president
yeltsin
and
president
clinton
and
were
hoping
that
together
we
might
send
a
strong
signal
to
the
american
business
community
that
we
support
their
efforts
to
invest
in
russia
that
the
united
states
through
ex
im
and
opec
and
the
department
of
commerce
will
be
there
to
support
them
q
my
question
is
is
yeltsin
in
any
position
to
deliver
on
making
russia
a
more
senior
administration
official
we
think
he
is
i
would
note
that
president
yeltsins
prime
minister
mr
chernomyrdin
worked
for
years
in
the
russian
oil
and
gas
sector
he
will
now
chair
a
highlevel
commission
with
the
vice
president
vice
president
gore
to
try
to
break
through
the
barriers
that
currently
exist
to
western
investment
in
the
oil
and
gas
sector
we
believe
we
have
a
commitment
to
make
that
committee
an
important
committee
and
were
looking
forward
to
the
work
q
what
type
of
mechanism
is
already
in
place
to
administer
the
private
sector
portion
of
the
program
and
will
the
us
be
directly
involved
in
the
tail
end
of
distribution
of
the
actual
funds
or
is
the
money
simply
turned
over
to
the
russian
government
for
distribution
at
their
will
senior
administration
official
are
you
talking
about
the
variety
of
programs
listed
here
it
depends
on
the
program
itself
in
most
cases
though
we
are
either
working
through
american
pbos
or
american
government
agencies
to
ensure
that
the
money
obviously
is
well
spent
that
the
money
gets
to
the
intended
source
thats
an
obligation
we
have
to
the
congress
to
ensure
the
money
is
well
spent
and
that
we
can
account
for
the
money
we
have
done
that
in
the
last
couple
of
months
intensively
and
we
will
continue
to
do
it
for
each
of
these
programs
but
they
are
all
quite
different
for
instance
in
the
area
of
grant
food
and
medical
assistance
for
grant
food
it
is
carried
out
through
usda
and
usda
accounts
for
the
delivery
of
the
food
for
grant
medical
assistance
weve
been
working
through
project
hope
which
is
a
private
organization
for
the
housing
for
instance
the
resettlement
of
russian
officers
well
be
working
with
a
group
of
american
pbos
on
some
of
the
democratization
projects
were
working
directly
with
russian
private
individuals
and
private
foundations
were
working
with
journalists
in
russia
on
a
media
project
that
you
may
have
noticed
so
we
literally
have
here
to
different
activities
under
all
these
rubrics
and
theyre
all
going
to
be
carried
out
in
slightly
different
ways
some
directly
with
the
russian
government
some
with
russian
citizens
q
the
jacksonvanik
restrictions
that
remain
and
on
the
cocom
restrictions
that
remain
can
you
tell
us
what
the
president
has
to
do
on
that
senior
administration
official
well
as
george
noted
yesterday
president
yeltsin
raised
these
as
irritants
in
the
relationship
the
president
has
noted
that
i
think
its
fair
to
say
we
will
go
back
now
in
our
own
government
when
we
return
to
washington
and
look
at
both
of
these
questions
and
well
get
back
to
the
russian
government
q
you
were
not
prepared
for
these
questions
when
you
got
here
senior
administration
official
we
were
prepared
for
these
questions
weve
looked
at
them
but
were
not
prepared
to
make
a
quick
decision
this
weekend
they
require
let
me
just
explain
particularly
on
jacksonvanik
they
require
consultation
with
the
congress
they
require
consultation
with
the
american
jewish
community
and
were
very
sensitive
to
those
concerns
and
so
well
want
to
go
back
and
talk
to
them
before
we
take
any
action
q
is
this
package
designed
so
that
you
will
not
have
to
go
to
congress
for
anything
at
this
point
senior
administration
official
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
the
advantage
of
this
particular
package
is
that
all
the
funds
have
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
so
the
administration
will
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
seek
any
additional
authority
to
fund
any
of
these
efforts
in
effect
they
can
all
begin
tomorrow
and
i
know
that
many
of
the
agencies
responsible
for
these
projects
will
begin
tomorrow
and
thats
the
advantage
of
this
particular
initiative
q
if
this
as
the
president
says
is
a
longterm
longhaul
thing
and
members
of
congress
are
at
this
moment
heading
for
moscow
why
arent
you
talking
about
going
to
congress
and
suggesting
to
the
president
of
russia
that
you
are
prepared
to
go
to
congress
for
various
things
senior
administration
official
i
think
weve
been
clear
about
that
the
president
is
discussing
this
weekend
with
president
yeltsin
some
additional
ideas
that
we
have
for
american
funding
of
additional
projects
and
ideas
that
he
has
we
have
a
major
congressional
delegation
that
left
last
night
headed
by
representative
gephardt
and
well
want
to
consult
with
that
delegation
and
other
members
of
congress
before
doing
anything
and
well
also
want
to
consult
with
our
allies
so
thats
where
it
stands
now
q
weve
been
told
repeatedly
that
a
number
of
these
items
represent
different
or
new
ways
of
spending
the
money
already
appropriated
could
you
just
tick
off
which
of
these
items
represents
reprogramming
or
at
least
spending
money
in
ways
that
it
was
not
previously
set
to
be
senior
administration
official
i
think
that
weve
said
that
these
are
all
projects
that
either
congress
had
allocated
money
for
through
the
freedom
support
act
there
were
some
funds
that
were
left
over
from
fy
and
this
administration
took
office
and
had
some
new
ideas
about
how
the
funds
might
be
expended
we
didnt
use
just
the
freedom
support
act
funds
or
the
fy
funds
we
went
into
some
of
the
agency
allocations
exim
opic
and
usda
and
tried
to
look
for
creative
ways
to
further
our
programs
and
example
of
that
is
the
food
for
progress
concessional
loans
we
had
hit
a
brick
wall
with
another
type
of
funding
through
usda
we
could
not
go
forward
legally
and
so
we
looked
for
a
more
creative
way
to
ensure
continued
american
market
share
and
ensure
continued
grain
sales
and
we
think
we
found
it
q
where
for
example
are
you
getting
the
money
for
this
russian
officer
resettlement
senior
administration
official
thats
from
the
freedom
support
act
funds
q
in
other
words
all
of
the
money
is
being
directly
spent
in
new
ways
so
to
speak
senior
administration
official
most
of
the
grant
projects
that
you
see
if
you
look
at
the
general
chart
the
second
chart
its
broken
down
into
grant
and
credits
and
if
you
look
under
grants
the
technical
cooperation
projects
that
total
million
that
is
almost
all
freedom
support
act
funding
a
little
bit
of
it
is
leftover
funds
from
fiscal
year
the
nunnlugar
funds
of
course
you
know
about
the
legislative
history
of
those
funds
q
cooperation
senior
administration
official
from
fy
i
dont
have
the
exact
figure
it
was
not
a
considerable
figure
q
could
you
tell
us
please
has
anything
happened
here
this
weekend
that
will
break
the
log
jam
between
ukraine
and
russia
over
start
for
start
i
and
ii
as
a
result
of
whats
happened
here
senior
administration
official
both
presidents
president
yeltsin
and
president
clinton
will
be
discussing
this
issue
this
morning
in
fact
we
havent
yet
gotten
to
security
and
arms
control
related
issues
that
will
be
this
mornings
session
i
know
that
president
clinton
will
be
very
strongly
reinforcing
that
this
is
a
top
priority
for
us
weve
been
talking
to
the
russians
and
the
ukrainians
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
about
ways
that
we
might
help
to
facilitate
the
discussions
between
them
up
to
this
point
this
has
been
a
very
important
negotiation
thats
been
going
on
essentially
between
moscow
and
kiev
and
we
are
at
the
point
now
of
essentially
discussing
with
them
if
there
are
ways
that
we
could
contribute
to
this
discussion
help
to
move
things
forward
essentially
but
in
terms
of
what
is
coming
out
of
this
weekend
i
dont
yet
know
in
a
couple
hours
well
know
q
just
a
followup
on
the
financing
here
is
any
of
this
robbing
peter
to
pay
boris
since
its
all
current
year
appropriations
have
you
taken
it
from
anyplace
thats
been
earmarked
and
put
it
into
this
fund
senior
administration
official
there
are
smoke
and
mirrors
here
and
i
think
its
an
important
point
to
note
we
could
have
given
you
a
page
of
assistance
numbers
that
included
outyear
funding
were
going
to
make
a
longterm
commitment
to
many
of
these
projects
for
instance
the
enterprise
funds
the
privatization
effort
the
housing
effort
and
weve
already
talked
to
the
russians
about
our
longterm
commitment
we
could
have
put
in
really
big
numbers
and
this
could
have
been
a
bigger
package
but
we
wanted
to
make
a
point
this
package
is
fy
its
funds
that
we
have
and
were
going
to
do
what
we
say
were
going
to
do
and
the
president
feels
very
strongly
about
that
in
the
past
there
is
a
legacy
that
the
western
governments
the
combination
of
governments
put
up
large
budget
figures
and
for
any
number
of
reasons
were
not
able
to
meet
them
were
determined
and
the
president
is
determined
to
carry
out
every
single
program
in
this
package
and
well
do
it
but
we
do
have
a
longerterm
commitment
and
thats
part
of
the
discussions
on
economics
this
weekend
were
looking
for
russian
ideas
on
what
it
is
we
can
do
to
most
effectively
support
reform
and
weve
told
them
that
we
do
have
a
commitment
on
some
of
these
programs
beyond
this
fiscal
year
q
taken
it
way
from
any
senior
administration
official
no
we
havent
okay
the
question
is
have
we
reprogrammed
any
of
these
funds
so
have
we
taken
it
from
other
countries
to
pay
for
programs
in
russia
the
answer
is
no
we
have
not
done
so
q
in
terms
of
funding
there
is
no
available
monies
left
and
you
simply
find
a
creative
way
to
find
money
somewhere
else
doesnt
that
in
fact
support
the
theory
senior
administration
official
not
at
all
i
dont
think
it
does
thats
a
particular
example
and
the
example
is
grain
sales
the
commodity
credit
corporation
credit
guarantee
program
was
shortterm
loans
that
russia
had
to
pay
back
within
to
months
you
all
know
about
russias
debt
problem
and
russia
was
unable
to
meet
those
commitments
so
we
looked
for
a
way
to
do
two
things
to
meet
russias
requirement
for
grain
theyre
a
net
grain
importer
on
a
massive
scale
and
also
meet
our
objective
of
making
sure
that
the
american
farmers
have
a
chance
to
sell
their
products
to
russia
and
we
simply
look
for
another
way
to
finance
that
and
we
have
legislative
authority
to
do
it
this
program
has
been
successful
in
other
areas
we
had
not
tried
it
before
in
the
former
soviet
union
but
we
thought
we
should
now
q
isnt
this
really
the
bushclinton
aid
package
for
russia
since
these
funds
were
really
first
derived
by
initiatives
put
forward
by
president
bush
senior
administration
official
no
i
dont
think
thats
a
fair
characterization
a
lot
of
these
funds
were
appropriated
by
the
us
congress
is
in
this
administration
took
office
and
inherited
some
obligations
that
the
bush
administration
had
made
but
we
had
a
long
six
to
seven
week
review
of
this
program
we
decided
to
meet
the
commitments
that
had
been
made
by
the
previous
administration
but
we
have
gone
well
beyond
them
in
funding
the
enterprise
fund
which
was
just
an
idea
but
the
idea
had
not
been
filled
out
with
a
program
there
was
no
number
attached
to
it
in
grouping
together
some
projects
and
trying
to
make
them
into
a
coherent
whole
in
the
privatization
effort
i
would
say
is
another
clinton
initiative
further
we
listened
to
the
russian
government
and
listened
to
the
russian
military
who
told
us
that
the
resettlement
of
their
officers
was
important
to
them
for
political
and
economic
and
social
reasons
and
president
clinton
has
responded
to
that
and
we
are
making
a
longterm
commitment
that
beyond
this
demonstration
project
were
going
to
figure
out
a
way
to
do
much
more
in
trying
to
settle
those
officers
i
would
also
say
that
the
president
has
given
impetus
to
all
of
us
in
the
agencies
to
think
much
more
broadly
about
what
it
is
we
can
do
on
democratization
because
there
we
have
some
experience
and
some
comparative
advantage
that
lends
itself
to
the
russian
experience
and
in
calling
for
the
creation
of
a
democracy
corps
which
is
another
new
initiative
were
hopeful
that
we
can
take
the
resources
of
the
private
sector
as
well
as
the
american
government
to
achieve
that
objective
so
i
would
not
characterize
it
that
way
at
all
and
as
most
of
you
know
i
am
a
career
civil
servant
i
was
in
the
last
administration
im
very
familiar
with
what
the
last
administration
did
and
i
would
characterize
this
as
a
clinton
assistance
package
for
russia
q
theres
been
a
lot
of
criticism
that
aid
in
the
past
has
not
gotten
to
the
people
is
there
anything
in
this
outside
of
the
ombudsman
that
will
guarantee
that
this
money
will
not
just
disappear
because
its
being
administered
by
the
russian
government
senior
administration
official
i
think
that
i
know
that
the
president
and
other
senior
officials
of
our
government
are
concerned
that
american
money
be
spent
wisely
and
that
it
get
to
the
source
that
its
intended
for
which
its
intended
and
so
were
going
to
take
great
care
aid
and
the
state
department
will
take
great
care
in
making
sure
that
the
funds
are
expended
properly
and
that
theyre
reaching
their
source
i
would
not
that
this
package
is
not
simply
a
package
of
support
solely
to
the
russian
government
some
of
these
projects
especially
in
democratization
and
exchanges
are
going
to
be
worked
out
directly
with
russian
private
individuals
with
businesses
the
private
enterprise
support
is
another
example
of
that
senior
administration
official
if
i
could
just
add
a
word
on
this
point
with
regard
to
the
ssdrelated
programs
one
area
that
weve
been
looking
at
very
very
closely
is
consideration
of
actually
using
russian
firms
in
subcontracting
for
these
kinds
of
programs
they
would
be
working
very
closely
of
course
with
the
american
firms
who
would
be
the
prime
contractors
but
this
is
a
fine
example
i
think
of
a
more
of
a
imaginative
and
flexible
approach
toward
getting
some
of
that
funding
down
to
the
grassroots
level
down
to
the
ground
in
russia
but
at
the
same
time
ensuring
that
it
is
spent
efficiently
and
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended
q
when
would
the
democracy
corps
start
exactly
when
do
you
see
this
happening
how
would
get
it
off
the
ground
senior
administration
official
well
the
president
is
today
calling
for
the
creation
of
a
democracy
corps
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
were
going
to
work
out
its
framework
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
ambassador
simons
takes
up
his
duties
on
may
st
but
in
effect
weve
already
started
because
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
the
administration
has
begun
to
reach
out
to
people
in
the
private
sector
who
have
come
to
us
asking
us
to
help
facilitate
their
activities
in
russia
and
weve
said
that
we
will
be
helpful
weve
also
tried
to
kind
of
coordinate
in
a
much
more
effective
way
the
activities
of
our
own
government
we
do
have
or
agencies
that
are
active
in
russia
in
one
way
or
another
we
think
it
makes
sense
to
draw
them
together
and
to
focus
their
efforts
q
excuse
me
how
much
of
this
billion
will
actually
be
spent
in
the
united
states
by
american
made
goods
senior
administration
official
i
dont
have
any
figures
for
you
now
but
perhaps
we
could
try
to
work
something
up
in
the
next
couple
of
days
on
that
q
this
figure
is
larger
than
the
figure
that
has
been
in
the
press
did
this
program
grow
yesterday
as
a
result
of
the
discussions
or
have
we
just
been
that
far
off
the
mark
senior
administration
official
no
i
think
unfortunately
the
press
has
been
a
little
bit
off
the
mark
and
im
sorry
to
say
that
no
this
package
president
clinton
put
us
to
work
about
seven
weeks
ago
on
this
package
and
he
was
briefed
intensively
on
this
he
contributed
a
lot
of
the
intellectual
leadership
in
this
package
he
contributed
a
lot
of
the
ideas
in
the
package
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
we
had
this
rough
package
worked
out
about
two
weeks
ago
we
have
been
refining
it
ever
since
we
spent
a
couple
of
days
last
week
going
over
it
with
the
russian
government
both
the
embassy
in
washington
and
the
government
in
moscow
through
our
own
embassy
and
so
its
been
evolving
but
this
particular
package
has
been
together
for
about
two
weeks
q
where
is
yeltsins
input
into
this
then
there
was
so
much
talk
before
about
the
president
wanted
to
get
yeltsins
views
about
specifically
what
was
needed
and
so
forth
is
that
in
the
out
years
senior
administration
official
no
its
both
president
yeltsin
has
on
several
occasions
told
us
for
instance
that
support
for
the
creation
of
private
businesses
is
important
to
him
that
the
resettlement
of
russian
military
officers
is
important
and
that
first
and
foremost
the
effort
to
privatize
the
state
industries
is
important
to
them
and
so
what
we
did
was
to
try
to
make
those
the
centerpiece
of
our
technical
assistance
part
o
the
package
we
listened
to
him
on
the
privatization
effort
we
have
been
working
with
the
russian
government
for
months
on
this
trying
to
work
out
all
the
details
so
the
russian
government
on
most
of
these
programs
was
involved
every
step
of
the
way
but
let
me
get
at
the
other
part
of
your
question
the
president
is
also
using
this
weekend
to
talk
about
a
broader
set
of
initiatives
that
we
might
undertake
and
were
looking
for
his
ideas
the
president
has
brought
his
own
ideas
to
the
table
for
instance
on
energy
and
the
environment
and
in
housing
but
were
looking
for
russian
ideas
not
we
need
to
consult
with
the
congress
and
we
need
to
consult
with
the
other
allied
governments
that
are
also
active
q
theres
essentially
nothing
that
happened
in
the
last
day
and
a
half
that
measurably
altered
the
package
that
you
came
in
with
senior
administration
official
this
particular
package
as
i
said
was
worked
out
and
was
ready
about
two
weeks
ago
we
have
since
then
consulted
with
the
russian
government
on
the
final
stages
of
its
development
and
so
this
weekend
weve
primarily
talked
about
future
about
what
more
the
united
states
and
other
western
countries
can
do
to
support
reform
in
russia
which
is
our
base
objective
here
q
i
noticed
that
you
that
money
appropriated
to
train
bankers
and
businessmen
and
officers
can
you
tell
me
what
about
job
training
for
workers
who
are
displaced
by
privatization
senior
administration
official
youre
right
we
have
a
program
to
train
russian
young
russians
in
banking
and
financial
services
in
the
united
states
part
of
the
housing
initiative
its
not
just
to
build
housing
units
its
to
retrain
russian
officers
who
are
retiring
into
other
professions
q
money
for
job
training
for
workers
whose
jobs
are
disappearing
because
of
privatization
senior
administration
official
we
have
not
yet
allocated
any
money
for
that
q
why
not
q
of
the
million
is
going
to
build
housing
units
isnt
that
a
lot
of
money
per
unit
given
what
the
western
dollar
will
buy
in
the
former
soviet
union
senior
administration
official
if
you
want
to
do
housing
the
right
way
its
not
just
the
building
the
framework
of
a
house
youve
got
to
think
about
all
the
utilities
youve
got
to
think
about
the
purchase
of
land
youve
got
to
think
about
sewage
and
gas
and
electricity
and
so
forth
and
its
also
retraining
its
not
enough
to
put
retired
an
officer
coming
out
of
riga
or
tallin
or
vilnius
in
a
house
in
western
russia
we
think
we
have
an
obligation
to
try
to
retrain
those
officers
as
well
this
is
responding
to
a
request
from
the
russian
government
q
of
the
million
will
go
to
retrain
senior
administration
official
thats
right
q
are
you
talking
about
apartment
buildings
or
single
senior
administration
official
were
talking
about
single
individual
dwellings
q
youre
saying
that
only
families
will
be
served
by
this
senior
administration
official
what
i
want
to
i
thought
i
pointed
out
earlier
this
is
a
demonstration
project
what
we
didnt
want
to
do
given
the
experience
that
the
germans
and
the
turks
and
the
italians
have
had
in
building
housing
in
western
russian
we
did
not
want
to
leap
into
it
with
a
huge
amount
of
money
what
we
want
to
do
is
work
over
the
next
couple
of
months
and
try
to
figure
out
with
american
organizations
in
the
private
sector
the
best
way
to
get
this
job
done
i
noted
that
we
have
a
longterm
commitment
to
that
and
so
i
would
expect
that
we
would
put
a
lot
more
money
into
this
in
the
future
but
we
want
to
do
it
wisely
we
want
to
spend
the
money
wisely
q
what
is
it
about
this
program
that
convinces
you
that
it
will
protect
russias
reforms
and
that
russia
will
be
in
a
position
to
may
back
the
money
theyre
supposed
to
pay
back
especially
considering
their
other
debt
problem
senior
administration
official
well
look
i
think
its
important
to
note
that
the
united
states
on
its
own
does
not
have
the
capability
to
fuel
a
continuation
of
russian
reform
its
got
to
be
a
collective
western
effort
and
were
looking
to
our
allies
to
do
more
as
well
but
beyond
that
its
really
what
the
russians
do
that
is
going
to
decide
the
fate
of
reform
we
can
simply
play
a
role
and
we
feel
we
have
an
obligation
to
do
so
which
is
consistent
with
our
national
interests
q
did
the
president
say
that
the
value
of
the
us
contribution
was
that
it
would
create
security
and
prosperity
for
the
united
states
so
what
is
it
about
this
program
that
does
this
senior
administration
official
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
fundamental
objective
of
our
policy
toward
russia
and
that
is
we
want
to
do
everything
we
can
to
support
the
continuation
of
reform
we
are
convinced
that
if
reformers
stay
in
power
then
well
be
able
to
continue
the
drawdown
of
nuclear
forces
foreign
policy
cooperation
and
economic
interaction
which
are
the
three
benefits
to
the
united
states
from
reform
in
russia
so
its
not
a
simple
question
you
cant
just
say
that
this
program
is
the
answer
its
a
longterm
question
and
we
have
to
make
a
longterm
commitment
to
it
q
and
then
on
the
question
of
russias
ability
to
repay
what
convinces
you
theyll
be
able
to
pay
seven
to
years
from
now
senior
administration
official
well
the
russian
government
has
made
a
commitment
to
repay
and
what
were
hoping
is
that
if
reform
continues
and
if
they
can
continue
to
improve
their
oil
and
gas
sector
and
earn
additional
hard
currency
revenues
that
russia
will
be
in
a
position
six
or
seven
years
from
now
to
pay
back
those
loans
q
substantial
governmenttogovernment
loan
weve
ever
gotten
into
with
the
russians
senior
administration
official
i
dont
want
to
answer
authoritatively
on
that
i
dont
go
back
or
years
on
this
but
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
yes
it
is
because
the
previous
way
that
we
financed
grain
exports
was
really
to
just
ensure
private
bank
loans
this
is
a
different
type
of
effort
q
government
loans
in
any
other
sector
that
you
recall
i
know
it
wasnt
done
in
senior
administration
official
i
think
its
fair
to
say
this
is
a
new
and
unique
effort
end
