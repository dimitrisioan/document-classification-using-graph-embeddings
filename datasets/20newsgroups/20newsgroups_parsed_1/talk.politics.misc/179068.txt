the
selective
service
registration
should
be
abolished
to
start
with
the
draft
is
immoral
whether
you
agree
with
that
or
not
we
dont
have
one
now
and
military
experts
agree
that
the
quality
of
the
armed
forces
is
superior
with
a
volunteer
army
than
with
draftees
finally
the
government
has
us
on
many
lists
in
many
computers
the
irs
social
security
admistration
and
motor
vehicle
registries
to
name
a
few
and
it
can
find
us
if
it
needs
to
maintaining
yet
another
list
of
people
is
an
utter
waste
of
money
and
time
lets
axe
this
whole
department
and
reduce
the
deficit
a
little
bit
more
gridlock
talk
from
another
relic
of
the
past
the
selective
service
system
creates
jobs
and
is
an
investment
in
the
future
of
americaand
whats
wrong
with
that
do
we
want
to
create
jobs
or
do
we
want
jobs
created
that
are
productive
in
our
supplydemand
economy
if
your
answer
is
the
former
then
we
can
just
round
up
all
jobless
people
and
pay
them
to
build
sandcastles
in
the
desert
if
you
answer
the
latter
then
i
fail
to
see
how
another
bureaucracy
produces
anything
we
need
jobs
because
at
this
point
in
the
recovery
the
economy
should
have
generated
billion
jobs
and
since
it
has
not
the
government
has
to
step
in
and
help
shutting
down
selective
service
would
cost
good
jobs
and
we
cant
do
that
what
we
really
need
is
to
involve
selective
service
in
a
more
closely
directed
manner
we
need
the
selective
service
involved
in
environmental
protection
highspeed
rail
commuter
aircraft
civil
rights
national
service
and
health
care
every
dollar
we
put
into
selective
service
now
will
get
us
less
spending
in
future
i
really
believe
now
to
think
about
it
that
selective
service
is
longpast
due
for
the
creation
of
a
cabinet
position
your
not
beyond
hope
just
get
back
on
americas
side
and
start
doing
your
part
for
change
what
bill
needs
from
you
now
is
support
for
the
economic
stimulus
and
health
care
reform
you
need
to
devote
all
your
energies
to
fighting
gridlock
and
supporting
change
get
on
the
team
after
all
the
evil
has
been
banished
from
washington
and
the
time
for
complaint
is
past
being
neccessary
and
remember
bill
clinton
cares
he
may
someday
even
have
a
town
meeting
in
your
city
if
your
an
appropriate
sort
of
person
if
you
phrase
your
questions
properly
and
show
the
proper
respect
and
awe
you
might
have
the
chance
to
ask
mr
president
your
question
in
person
oh
i
get
it
this
is
sarcastic
right
