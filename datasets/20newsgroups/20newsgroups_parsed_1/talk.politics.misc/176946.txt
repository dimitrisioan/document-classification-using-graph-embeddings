gay
men
constitute
at
least
of
all
child
molestations
whether
this
is
because
gay
molesters
are
unusually
common
or
have
unusually
high
numbers
of
victims
sort
of
misses
the
point
doesnt
it
it
means
that
whichever
is
the
case
homosexual
men
are
remarkably
hazardous
to
children
clayton
says
you
are
incorrect
the
most
recent
survey
data
i
can
find
shows
that
of
molestation
is
exclusively
homosexuals
is
bisexual
victims
are
both
male
and
female
and
the
remainder
is
exclusively
heterosexual
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
of
the
child
molestations
are
committed
by
heterosexuals
i
can
not
see
the
correlation
you
cite
bisexuals
are
heterosexuals
since
when
which
concludes
that
by
being
homosexual
you
will
molest
children
or
that
by
being
homosexual
you
will
have
the
propensity
for
molesting
children
i
havent
said
that
homosexual
child
molester
simply
that
is
more
likely
if
of
the
molestations
are
by
homosexuals
why
are
you
so
concerned
about
creating
a
relation
between
the
two
if
you
had
evidence
that
of
the
molestations
are
committed
by
homosexuals
you
might
find
a
relationship
ok
where
is
the
realtionship
you
make
the
one
that
is
shown
when
nambla
marches
in
gay
parades
also
what
is
the
reason
people
molest
from
human
sexuality
and
a
psych
class
or
too
i
have
taken
the
overwhelming
voice
says
that
people
commit
these
acts
as
power
trips
and
to
feel
in
control
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
sexual
orientation
you
mean
that
sm
because
its
a
power
trip
has
nothing
to
do
with
sexual
orientation
