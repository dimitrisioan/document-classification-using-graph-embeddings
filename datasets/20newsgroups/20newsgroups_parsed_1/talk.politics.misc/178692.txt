the
selective
service
registration
should
be
abolished
to
start
with
the
draft
is
immoral
whether
you
agree
with
that
or
not
we
dont
have
one
now
and
military
experts
agree
that
the
quality
of
the
armed
forces
is
superior
with
a
volunteer
army
than
with
draftees
finally
the
government
has
us
on
many
lists
in
many
computers
the
irs
social
security
admistration
and
motor
vehicle
registries
to
name
a
few
and
it
can
find
us
if
it
needs
to
maintaining
yet
another
list
of
people
is
an
utter
waste
of
money
and
time
lets
axe
this
whole
department
and
reduce
the
deficit
a
little
bit
im
really
surprised
clinton
hasnt
already
tried
to
do
this
he
seems
to
want
to
tackle
other
irrelevant
issues
first
so
why
not
this
one
as
well
let
me
say
this
about
that
as
a
retired
navy
officer
i
agree
cut
it
but
lets
not
stop
there
eliminate
the
c
transport
wrong
we
need
its
capability
sure
it
has
its
problems
very
few
airplanes
havent
but
getting
rid
of
something
we
need
is
not
the
answer
what
do
you
want
to
do
start
over
a
rebuild
a
new
airplane
from
scatch
itll
have
its
problems
as
well
and
there
will
be
calls
again
for
it
to
be
scrapped
the
other
option
is
to
try
to
extend
the
life
of
the
cs
and
cs
that
are
getting
extremely
old
scrap
the
seawolf
ssn
nuclear
submarine
ground
the
b
stealth
bomber
itll
cost
jobs
but
im
for
it
we
especially
dont
need
a
b
the
ssn
i
know
litttle
about
fpa
