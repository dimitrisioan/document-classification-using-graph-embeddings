likes
to
dodge
the
issues
of
morality
and
behavior
crying
that
anyone
who
raises
them
blames
the
victim
nonetheless
as
a
recent
editorial
in
the
los
angeles
times
pointed
out
the
free
love
advocates
of
the
s
have
demolished
the
poor
its
one
thing
to
have
children
out
of
wedlock
if
youre
say
murphy
brown
or
someone
like
her
turning
over
a
six
figure
salary
and
quite
another
if
youre
sixteen
have
no
skills
and
no
income
and
how
did
the
free

advocates
of
the
s
manage
to
perform
this
demolitionforced
breeding
programs
or
something
by
accepting

parenthood
the
s
radicals
espousing
free
love
set
the
stage
for
catastrophe
among
the
poor
they
must
account
for
this
now
let
me
get
this
straight
after
a
nice
long
rant
about
how
people
need
to
take
personal
responsibility
for
their
economic
and
social
lives
all
of
a
sudden
s
radicals
such
as
me
i
guess
are
responsible
for
poor
peoples
lifestyles
tell
me
how
that
worksor
do
you
think
that
poor
people
are
just
too
dumb
to
think
for
themselves
there
are
many
reasons
for
the
disintegration
of
the
family
and
support
systems
in
general
among
this
