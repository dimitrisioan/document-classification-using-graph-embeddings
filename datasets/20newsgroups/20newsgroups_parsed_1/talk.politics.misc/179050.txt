percentage

writes
elf
sternberg
but
if
less
than
of
the
population
is
gay
what
can
we
say
about
these
people
who
dont
identify
as
gay
but
have
demonstrated
gay
potential
obviously
a
large
chunk
of
these
people
chose
or
more
accurately
were
forced
to
choose
by
force
of
religion
and
social
sanction
to
put
those
feelings
aside
to
be
heterosexual
obviously
cramer
and
kaldis
fall
into
this
category
i
cant
speak
for
kaldis
but
force
of
religion
and
social
sanction
played
no
part
in
my
sexual
preferences
neither
had
much
influence
on
me
as
a
teenager
you
might
as
well
have
you
certainly
would
not
have
been
in
error
if
you
would
have
the
views
expressed
herein
are
theodore
a
kaldis
my
own
only
do
you
seriously
believe
that
a
major
university
rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
as
this
would
hold
such
views
