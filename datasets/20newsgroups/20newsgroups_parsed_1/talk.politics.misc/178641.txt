writes
the
above
conveniently
ignores
the
murder
of
four
batf
agents
by
the
branch
davidians
in
an
unprovoked
ambush
that
has
not
been
demonstrated
had
he
come
to
trial
there
was
a
very
real
possibility
that
koresh
would
have
gotten
an
acquittal
on
grounds
of
self
defense
all
survivors
of
the
debacle
have
sworn
that
the
batf
shot
first
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
they
rang
the
doorbell
using
a
concussion
grenade
and
if
the
bloody
warrants
were
legal
then
why
were
they
sealed
after
the
fight
started
and
if
koresh
had
declared
himself
a
private
state
and
was
just
daring
the
govt
to
go
in
then
why
did
he
surrender
last
year
to
a
local
sheriff
who
served
a
warrant
forhisarrest
as
opposed
to
the
batf
search
warrant
which
did
not
include
arrest
unless
violations
were
found
by
just
calling
him
up
to
tell
him
and
then
going
out
to
collect
him
with
his
squad
car
that
doesnt
sound
like
a
dictator
to
me
it
sounds
like
someone
who
knows
he
has
a
court
battle
things
might
have
gone
very
differently
if
the
batf
had
rung
the
doorbell
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
this
is
stupid
that
is
no
paranoid
assertion
it
is
testamony
from
surviving
witnesses
and
the
batf
has
no
tanks
nor
am
i
aware
of
either
the
batf
or
the
fbi
using
any
until
yesterday
when
they
use
maximum
force
they
do
just
what
they
did
that
first
day
that
got
four
officers
killed
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a
warant
on
the
place
by
ludicrously
underarmed
and
unprotected
police
underarmed
you
flabberghast
me
they
were
loaded
for
bear
and
every
picture
shows
them
wearing
bulletproof
vests
they
were
using
concussion
grenades
and
fullauto
weapons
what
was
missing
lowyield
tacnukes
this
is
a
transparent
attempt
to
retcon
a
justification
for
the
ridiculous
amount
of
force
used
both
initially
and
yesterday
you
should
be
ashamed
if
anyone
on
the
net
cares
to
suggest
a
sure
fire
method
of
bringing
the
murderes
of
four
police
officers
to
justice
perhaps
we
could
hear
it
they
had
a
surefire
method
keep
them
bottled
up
and
talk
them
to
death
or
surrender
without
giving
him
justification
for
some
looneytune
religious
stunt
phil
ive
been
reading
your
postings
for
months
and
im
convinced
that
you
will
back
anything
no
matter
how
damaging
it
may
be
to
yours
or
anyone
elses
rights
if
you
think
it
will
hurt
people
you
dont
like
its
people
with
that
attitude
that
set
up
the
preconditions
for
the
holocaust
a
process
that
is
in
place
now
in
this
country
even
if
the
tattered
pitiful
remains
of
the
constitution
is
slowing
its
progress
this
isnt
a
libertarian
issue
others
may
argue
that
line
but
from
a
strictly
constitutional
view
of
a
democratic
govt
what
the
fbi
and
batf
did
was
wrong
wrong
wrong
even
if
their
reasons
for
trying
to
arrest
koresh
were
right
anything
that
leads
to
the
deaths
of
children
if
nothing
else
touches
your
stoney
heart
is
wrong
no
matter
who
pushed
the
button
for
gods
sake
man
get
your
morality
back
larry

no
i
dont
speak
for
