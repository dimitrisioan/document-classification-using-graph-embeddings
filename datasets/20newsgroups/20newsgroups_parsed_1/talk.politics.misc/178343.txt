bill
anderson
writes
according
to
a
cnn
poll
to
key
reason
for
clintons
low
approval
rating
is
people
are
angry
about
him
not
moving
fast
enough
on
gays
in
the
military
i
just
burst
out
laughing
when
i
heard
this
what
planet
do
these
cnn
people
live
on
anyway
jason
c
austin
dunno
man
that
sounds
pretty
damned
unlikely
to
me
too
although
its
certainly
one
of
the
reasons
im
pissed
off
at
him
maybe
the
sample
was
taken
entirely
from
my
fellow
memebers
of
the
cultural
elite
jason
can
you
quote
some
of
these
poll
questions
thanks
bill
v
ive
never
seen
cnn
give
out
the
poll
questions
on
the
air
if
you
sent
them
a
letter
asking
for
them
you
might
get
them
heres
my
guess
of
how
part
of
a
session
might
look
question
do
you
approve
of
clintons
performance
answer
no
questions
do
you
disapprove
due
to
the
gays
in
the
military
issue
answer
yes
conclusion
clinton
has
a
low
approval
rating
because
hes
not
moving
fast
enough
on
gays
in
the
military
i
think
any
group
truly
dedicated
to
reporting
the
news
would
not
use
manufactured
news
like
polls
