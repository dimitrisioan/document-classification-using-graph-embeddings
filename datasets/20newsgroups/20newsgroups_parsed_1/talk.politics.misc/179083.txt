the
president
good
afternoon
please
be
seated
i
want
to
say
first
how
delighted
i
am
to
be
here
with
secretary
riley
and
with
senator
graham
the
three
of
us
served
as
governors
together
during
the
s
when
we
worked
constantly
on
strategies
to
improve
our
schools
when
we
led
often
difficult
and
long
efforts
to
upgrade
the
standards
in
american
education
and
to
improve
the
quality
of
instruction
our
children
were
receiving
there
were
no
two
governors
whom
i
admired
more
during
that
period
than
the
two
who
now
stand
on
this
stage
with
the
teacher
of
the
year
and
i
think
both
of
them
would
join
me
in
saying
that
after
all
the
testimony
has
been
heard
and
all
the
bills
have
been
passed
and
the
funds
have
been
raised
and
allocated
it
all
comes
down
to
what
happens
between
the
teacher
and
the
students
in
the
classroom
thats
why
todays
ceremony
honoring
the
national

of
