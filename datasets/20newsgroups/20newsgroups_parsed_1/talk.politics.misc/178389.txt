so
what
so
this
bolsters
the
contention
that
many
homosexuals
are
liars
this
statement
is
just
so
blatantly
disgusting
and
free
of
any
implicit
neural
activity
that
i
will
almost
completely
ignore

at
the
above
smacks
of
antihispanic
bigotry
sigh
its
so
amusing
to
watch
bigots

or
that
they

have
a
monopoly
on
eating
beans
or
that
this

is
seriously

obviously
a
