unless

the
problem
is
that
homosexuality
is
a
form
of
mental
disorder
caused
by
childhood
sexual
abuse

number
is

zero
the
only
time
i
have
heard
mention
of
such
a
mechanism
is
with
respect
to
female
homosexuality
resulting
from
heterosexual
childhood
abuse

this
as
only
one

several
factors
affecting

same
person
as
mr
cramer
appears
to
concentrate
on
male
homosexuality
i
doubt
this
