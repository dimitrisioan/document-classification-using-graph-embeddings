re
the
state
of
justice
gm
trial
in
article
not
a
boomer
writes
a
judge
denied
gms
new
trial
motion
even
though
gm
says
it
has
two
new
witnesses
that
said
the
occupant
of
the
truck
was
dead
from
the
impact
not
from
the
fire
thoughts
its
kind
of
scary
when
you
realize
that
judges
are
going
to
start
denying
new
trials
even
when
new
evidence
that
contradicts
the
facts
that
led
to
the
previous
ruling
appear
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
kind
of
scary
if
there
were
never
a
final
verdict
because
a
party
to
litigation
could
keep
saying
oops
i
forgot
to
bring
up
this
evidence
and
demand
a
new
trial
you
get
one
bite
at
the
apple
or
has
the
judge
decided
that
the
new
witnesses
are
not
to
be
believed
shouldnt
that
be
up
to
a
jury
its
up
to
general
motors
to
find
those
witnesses
in
the
first
litigation
youd
be
up
in
arms
if
a
plaintiff
suing
general
motors
pulled
the
same
stunt
and
made
them
relitigate
an
issue
that
they
already
lost
its
not
as
if
general
motors
couldnt
file
enough
discovery
motions
to
delay
the
trial
until
they
found
all
the
witnesses
they
wanted
and
what
about
members
of
the
previous
jury
parading
through
the
talk
shows
proclaiming
their
obvious
bias
against
gm
define
obvious
bias
shouldnt
that
be
enough
for
a
judge
to
through
out
the
old
verdict
and
call
for
a
new
trial
did
gm
move
for
a
new
trial
on
those
grounds
no
perhaps
they
had
a
reason
ted
frank
im
sorry
the
card
says
moops
