steve
proposes
a
system
of
checking
what
other
nations
are
in
to
as
criteria
for
what
our
government
should
try
i
counter
that
the
limits
of
the
constitution
might
be
a
better
place
to
check
gee
jim
if
youll
check
the
constitution
youll
find
in
order
to
promote
the
general
welfaredo
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
im
surprised
you
missed
it
its
right
there
in
the
first
paragraph
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made
it
at
least
through
the
preamble
you
almost
got
it
right
and
it
was
a
good
try
but
you
should
follow
your
own
advice
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
does
read
as
you
have
quoted
but
let
us
not
forget
that
after
all
it
is
only
the
preamble
it
is
not
a
binding
part
of
the
constitution
and
carries
no
weight
in
the
law
that
poor
tortured
paragraph
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
passages
in
the
english
language
witness
the
legions
of
blowhards
like
yourself
who
think
those
vague
flowery
phrases
are
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
do
you
really
believe
that
a
politician
only
has
to
give
lip
service
to
promoting
the
general
welfare
to
be
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
sorry
buddy
but
some
other
blowhards
managed
to
include
the
general
welfare
in
another
portion
of
the
constitution
article
i
section
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxesto
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
i
guess
they
wanted
to
make
sure
everyone
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preamble
just
to
make
sure
youve
got
the
point
lets
do
a
little
experiment
what
if
the
constitution
read
as
follows
preamble
we
the
people
to
promote
the
general
welfare
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
constitution
the
federal
government
shall
have
one
function
and
one
function
only
to
provide
for
the
defense
of
the
nation
the
government
would
not
then
have
two
functions
defense
and
welfare
but
since
it
explicitly
includes
both
the
general
welfare
and
defense
in
article
i
section
i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
constitutional
functions
right
steve
im
glad
to
see
that
you
abandoned
the
preamble
thing
what
did
you
do
a
word
search
to
find
welfare
somewhere
else
in
the
constitution
my
comments
and
paraphrases
in
brackets
article
i
section
in
some
ways
the
guts
of
the
constitution
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
to
pay
the
debts
indebtedness
as
defined
in
the
document
and
provide
for
the
common
defence
defence
as
precisely
defined
and
general
welfare
as
defined
through
the
document
mostly
in
ways
that
limit
the
government
of
the
united
states
but
the
above
taxes
shall
be
uniform
through
out
the
us
so
far
the
congress
has
been
given
the
power
to
collect
taxes
uniformly
then
to
borrow
money
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
interstate
and
indian
tribes
to
do
uniform
naturalization
and
bankruptcies
to
coin
money
regulate
the
value
thereof
and
etc
to
punish
counterfeiters
to
establish
post
offices
and
post
roads
to
provide
patents
and
copyrights
to
constitute
tribunals
inferior
to
the
supreme
court
to
define
and
punish
piracies
and
etc
to
declare
war
and
etc
to
raise
and
support
armiesbut
for
no
longer
than
two
years
at
a
stretch
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy
notice
no
time
limit
on
this
one
to
make
the
rules
for
the
army
and
navy
to
provide
for
calling
forth
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
etc
to
provide
for
training
of
the
army
except
for
some
state
stuff
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
dc
to
make
all
laws
necessary
to
execute
the
foregoing
powers
your
original
instinct
was
right
looking
to
other
nations
for
precedents
that
support
an
expansive
liberal
agenda
is
much
easier
than
looking
to
the
slim
pickins
found
in
the
constitution
