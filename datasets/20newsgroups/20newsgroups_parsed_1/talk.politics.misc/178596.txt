payoffs
ie
pork
to
puerto
ricans
that
others
have
been
making
still
stands
now
everybody
how
about
some
opinion
on
the
following
related
topic
should
the
people
who
are
natives
of
us
territories
have
representation
in
the
us
house
of
reps
or
the
us
congress
the
us
constitution
sets
up
the
house
of
representatives
to
represent
each
state
in
proportion
to
its
population
and
the
senate
to
represent
each
state
equally
what

be
done
with

like
puerto
rico
does
anyone
have
knowledge
about
how
this
was
handled
in
the
past
such
as
with
the
louisiana
