the
sc
allows
restrictions
after
viability
a
term
never
medically
defined
any
physician
who
cant
make
a
reasonable
stab
at
determining
whether
a
given
fetus
is
viable
or
not
is
not
qualified
to
perform
an
abortion
kebbin
shows
that
he
does
not
know
the
difference
between
determining
the
viability
of
an
individual
fetus
and
providing
the
universally
accepted
medical
definitions
of
viability
i
was
not
discussing
universal
definitions
in
this
post
mark
please
refrain
from
dragging
in
irrelevancies
do
you
agree
with
my
statement
above
about
physicians
being
unqualified
if
they
cant
determine
viability
since
we
know
that
there
are
some
physicians
out
there
who
are
qualified
to
perform
abortions
then
obviously
some
medical
definition
of
viability
is
being
employed
on
an
case
by
case
basis
viability
is
relatively
easy
to
determine
and
thats
good
enough
for
the
law
mark
so
why
do
you
keep
whining
that
viability
isnt
defined
what
purpose
does
your
whining
serve
