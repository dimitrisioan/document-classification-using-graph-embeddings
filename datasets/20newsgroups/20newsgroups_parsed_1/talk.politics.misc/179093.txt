i
cant
wait
for
the
investigation
considering
that
everyone
is
dead
now
and
the
place
is
burnt

will
just

to
take
the
word
of
the

about
how
much

a
threat
these
people
were
just
look
at
the
history
of
koresh
and
his
folowers
they
captured
the

a
few
yearss

in
a
gun
battle
with
a
rival
bd
sect
leaving
more
than
one
person
dead
they
werent
exactly

loving
bunch
koresh
some

that
shootout
were
you
unaware
of
this
or
did
you
purposly
leave
out
this
fact
the
fact
is
that
koresh
and
his
followers
involved
themselves
in
a
gun
battle
to
control
the
mt
carmel
complex
that
is
not
in
dispute
from
what
i
remember
of
the
trial
the
authories
couldnt
reasonably
establish
who
fired
first
the
big
reason
behind
