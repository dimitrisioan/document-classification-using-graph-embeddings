bbc
world
news
service
on
shortwave
originating
out
of
london
reports
that
a
survivor
of
the
waco
massacre
states
that
a
tank
when
making
a
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
building
knocked
over
a
kerosene
lamp
and
that
is
how
the
fire
started
attempts
were
made
by
the
people
inside
to
put
out
the
fire
but
it
spread
too
quickly
were
hearing
it
it
sure
rings
true
its
consistent
in
a
way
that
mass
suicide
by
fire
is
not
this
survivor
is
also
saying
that
they
it
rings
true
there
was
a
separate
report
that
an
overhead
helicopter
which
was
recording
the
entire
incident
on
video
tape
has
a
visual
record
of
several
files
i
think
the
number
was
mentioned
starting
at
different
parts
of
the
compound
has
this
video
been
made
public
the
fbi
spokesman
also
said
they
first
knew
of
the
fire
when
black
smoke
started
pouring
out
but
later
said
that
three
different
fbi
agents
saw
bd
members
starting
the
fires
also
the
fbi
claims
to
have
listening
devices
bugs
in
the
compound
will
they
make
public
the
tapes
of
what
the
bd
said
to
me
this
attempt
to
blame
the
fbi
for
starting
the
fire
simply
looks
like
an
attempt
by
a
survivor
to
shift
blame
away
from
the
bds
i
think
it
is
a
crock
well
sealing
the
initial
search
warrent
keeping
the
media
miles
away
not
letting
the
bd
talk
to
the
public
making
contradictory
statements
not
releasing
the
vidio
tapes
are
not
steps
to
ensure
public
confidence
in
their
actions
