thomas
farrell
said
a
good
case
a
fking
good
case
the
defense
lawyer
asked
the
victim
questions
like
what
kind
of
sexual
perversions
do
you
participate
in
and
you
think
he
made
a
good
case
speaking
as
someone
whos
only
about
six
weeks
and
a
tuition
bill
away
from
becoming
an
unemployed
slob
with
a
law
degree
id
really
like
to
see
a
transcript
of
this
trial
id
especially
like
to
know
what
happened
immediately
after
the
defense
attorney
asked
that
question
assuming
that
the
reports
that
he
did
so
are
accurate
im
not
accusing
tom
farrell
of
making
anything
up
but
this
is
the
sort
of
case
that
spawns
garbled
misquotes
false
rumors
and
urban
legends
like
tribbles
itd
be
nice
to
think
that
the
prosecutor
objected
irrelevant
prejudicial
inflammatory
take
your
pick
and
that
the
judge
upheld
the
objection
i
did
hear
this
question
asked
during
a
radio
news
update
of
the
case
they
were
talking
about
the
ongoing
trial
and
had
some
audio
clips
immediately
after
the
defense
attorney
asked
the
question
there
was
an
objection
heard
in
the
background
the
clip
ended
at
that
point
so
i
dont
know
if
the
objection
was
upheld
i
cant
imagine
nc
is
that
bad
the
arresting
officer
said
the
bastards
told
him
they
did
it
on
purpose
and
hoped
the
victim
would
die
and
you
think
the
defense
made
a
good
case
no
wonder
were
losing
were
aparently
not
trying
to
win
again
id
like
to
see
the
transcript
id
read
the
latter
bit
of
that
in
the
news
media
the
arresting
officer
testifying
that
one
of
the
defendants
calmly
asked
him
about
the
condition
of
the
homo
and
said
that
he
hoped
hed
die
but
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
of
the
officer
testifying
that
one
of
the
defendants
actually
said
that
he
did
anything
at
all
let
alone
that
he
did
it
on
purpose
this
i
didnt
hear
as
an
audio
clip
but
heard
it
reported
a
number
of
times
on
news
stories
both
during
and
after
the
trial
now
the
we
did
it
on
purpose
thing
is
stretching
i
think
it
was
something
more
likehe
had
it
coming
if
somebody
else
remebers
better
than
i
on
this
second
point
feel
free
to
clarify
