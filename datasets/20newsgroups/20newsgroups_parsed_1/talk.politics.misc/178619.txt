wouldnt
one
expect
more
heterosexual
men
than
gay
men
to
be
promiscuous
simply
due
to
a
larger
group
of
potential
partners
just
a
thought
matt
you
might
except
that
gay
men
are
much
more
promiscuous
than
straight
men
which
shows
how
damaged
and
screwed
up
gay
men
are
this
is
getting
sad
all
you
can
do
is
make
this
ridiculous
statements
based
upon
some
old
information
and
a
press
democrat
article

show
a
trend
within
the
everyday
gay
population

are
all
kinds
of
damaged
and
screwed
up
