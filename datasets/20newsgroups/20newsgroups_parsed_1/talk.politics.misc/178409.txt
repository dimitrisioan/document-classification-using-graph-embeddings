a
sad
day
for
civil
rights
but
typical
of
nc
unfortunately
if
it
is
typical
for
the
principle
of
reasonable
doubt
to
be
upheld
in
north
carolina
then
i
would
count
that
in
the
states
favor
reasonable
doubt
dates
back
to
human
rights
we
are
now
in
the
time
of
civil
rights
civil
rights
are
issued
by
the
state
with
whatever
strings
attached
they
choose
as
the
grantor
of
said
rights
and
if
that
means
that
verdicts
are
determined
by
the
needs
of
the
state
rather
than
by
guilt
or
innocence
in
a
traditional
sense
so
be
it
being
subjective
rather
than
objective
may
make
it
harder
to
anticipate
what
is
right
and
you
may
be
sacrificed
for
being
wrong
inadvertantly
once
in
a
while
but
that
really
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
the
common
good
dont
you
think
chris
all
jobs
are
easy
to
the
person
who
doesnt
have
to
do
