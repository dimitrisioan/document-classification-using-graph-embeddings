dont
look
at
me
i
want
to
send
aid
to
russia
many
other
conservatives
do
as
well
yes
it
was
nixon
who
was
most
vocal
about
giving
money
to
russia
it
makes
me
proud
to
be
a
libertarian
it
appears
both
conservatives
and
liberals
prefer
to
cold
war
until
you
win
then
nurse
the
enemy
back
to
health
for
another
go
around
enemy
sounds
like
thats
the
viewpoint
of
the
stereotypical
rednecked
conservative
always
been
commies
always
will
be
ok
i
should
have
said
former
enemy
i
was
being
sarcastic
about
what
interventionists
want
to
do
i
suggest
you
listen
very
carefully
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
his
people
are
saying
and
compare
that
with
the
very
antiwest
slogans
coming
from
his
opponents
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
could
we
back
him
without
forcing
others
to
back
him
at
the
point
of
a
gun
have
you
considered
a
noninterventionist
policy
if
market
reform
does
happen
russia
will
certainly
get
private
capital
at
private
risk
to
help
their
economy
they
will
even
have
incentive
to
do
so
for
the
same
reason
if
they
dont
reform
then
our
government
will
probably
consider
them
enemies
anyway
and
rather
spend
money
to
hurt
rather
than
help
them
then
theirs
the
ideological
point
we
want
to
win
russia
over
to
our
type
of
government
a
type
where
the
rulers
can
rule
without
limit
over
everyones
finances
its
like
subsidizing
the
wealthy
countries
japan
germany
etc
with
free
defense
and
then
tradewarring
with
them
because
of
the
economic
competition
its
like
subsidizing
tobacco
farmers
while
paying
bureaucrats
to
pursuade
people
not
to
smoke
better
to
let
them
degenerate
into
civil
war
remember
all
those
nuclear
weapons
in
russia
i
can
not
imagine
that
they
would
not
be
used
in
a
civil
war
if
nationialists
take
over
and
even
if
they
prevent
a
civil
war
most
feel
they
must
take
back
large
parts
of
land
that
are
in
other
countries
like
ukraine
i
also
can
not
imagine
ukraine
giving
up
land
without
a
fight
possibly
nuclear
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of
europe
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
th
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
if
a
billion
gift
was
that
important
to
our
well
being
couldnt
it
be
raised
voluntarilly
people
already
give
over
billion
a
year
to
charity
i
ask
myself
what
law
could
we
pass
to
prevent
government
from
doing
stupid
frivilous
things
with
our
money
then
i
think
the
constitution
was
supposed
to
do
that
could
someone
please
tell
me
what
legitimate
constitutional
power
the
federal
government
is
using
when
it
takes
money
from
my
paycheck
and
gives
it
to
needy
countries
seriously
seriously
everyone
has
different
opinions
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
causes
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong
space
program
someone
else
will
champion
welfare
or
education
or
doing
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
that
is
why
we
have
a
republic
and
not
a
true
democracy
instead
of
gridlock
on
a
massive
scale
we
only
have
gridlock
on
a
congressional
scale
it
seems
instead
of
gridlock
on
any
scale
we
have
aid
to
russia
expensive
space
programs
national
charity
that
doesnt
help
the
poor
and
probably
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
i
think
limited
government
is
more
key
than
how
democratic
it
is
btw
who
is
to
decide
stupid
this
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarians
were
against
that
was
an
opinion
and
libertarians
are
very
big
on
free
speech
actually
my
politics
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
and
this
is
why
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
join
the
party
it
seems
that
libertarians
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
if
you
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
then
you
should
be
very
libertarian
consider
it
a
compromise
how
much
money
would
your
fellow
russiaaiders
have
to
give
to
russia
if
those
you
oppose
werent
using
the
same
government
machine
to
steal
money
from
you
and
your
group
for
causes
you
dont
support
we
could
do
that
years
ago
but
not
now
people
have
been
saying
that
for
hundreds
of
years
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
beginnings
of
a
global
economy
and
global
decision
making
all
the
more
reason
to
depend
on
the
free
market
which
can
more
efficiently
process
information
than
to
depend
on
rulers
for
decisions
on
complex
issues

sometimes
it
is
said
that
man
can
not
be
trusted
with
the
government
of
himself
can
he
then
be
trusted
with
the
government
of
others
or
have
we
found
angels
in
the
forms
of
kings
to
govern
him
let
history
answer
this
question
