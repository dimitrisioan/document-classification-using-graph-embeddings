youre
not
buying
insurance
so
much
as
being
coerced
into
one
insurance
plan
no
it
is
optional
as
it
is
optional
for
doctors
to
accept
it
there
are
isolated
religeous
communities
in
particular
that
ask
for
exemptions
and
one
email
from
a
christian
scientist
in
edmonton
verified
for
me
that
it
is
indeed
negative
option
i
guess
that
you
can
argue
that
there
is
a
right
to
having
a
particular
insurance
but
so
far
ive
not
come
across
that
up
north
and
i
take
pains
to
keep
tabs
with
news
from
home
its
optional
but
what
if
you
dont
want
basic
coverage
on
the
governments
terms
you
said
before
that
if
you
opt
out
youre
basically
uninsured
there
are
two
things
at
work
here
the
public
insurance
is
very
wide
in
what
it
will
cover
as
the
amortization
is
also
universal
no
private
plan
can
boast
of
a
plan
that
fits
a
gaussian
curve
and
as
our
private
sector
has
discovered
theyre
better
off
not
offering
insurance
coverage
that
their
customers
are
going
to
use
and
that
turns
the
private
insurers
offering
the
frills
into
an
effective
cartelthey
dont
really
need
to
compete
because
as
you
put
it
theyre
in
a
winwin
situation
and
theyre
guaranteed
to
turn
a
profit
believe
me
they
probably
had
orgasms
when
they
figured
that
out
and
according
to
my
sister
the
yuppie
they
pat
themselves
on
the
back
to
the
point
of
ungraciousness
at
chamber
of
commerce
luncheons
so
in
a
sense
theyve
stopped
being
truly
capitalists
if
they
dont
have
to
worry
about
competing
anymore
you
might
say
that
the
total
effect
is
one
of
socialized
medicinea
government
providing
the
basics
and
a
cartel
providing
the
extras
there
is
no
alternative
to
the
system
desirable
or
not
the
alternative
to
the
system
is
no
system
at
all
patients
opted
out
doctors
opted
out
or
both
but
that
only
for
insurance
and
you
cant
force
a
private
insurance
company
to
sell
you
a
plan
that
they
will
not
offer
and
remember
that
the
actual
health
care
is
delivered
by
private
entities
who
collect
from
the
public
insurance
voluntarily
again
they
cant
force
a
private
entity
to
spring
to
life
to
pay
them
plus
there
is
the
matter
of
culture
and
values
im
basically
antitax
and
antigovernment
by
canadian
standards
yet
i
cant
bring
myself
to
make
the
same
arguments
as
you
do
despite
that
i
understand
where
youre
coming
from
up
north
youre
so
much
more
likely
to
find
someone
protesting
taxes
going
to
defence
than
health
insurance
premiums
to
only
one
fund
for
basic
coverage
interesting
side
notehave
any
new
insurance
companies
started
upfrom
scratchsince
medicare
became
standard
in
canada
i
actually
have
doubts
that
any
new
ones
have
emerged
since
ww
i
no
scratch
that
there
are
a
few
in
western
canada
and
quite
a
few
in
quebec
as
part
of
the
post
quebec
miracle
out
with
the
nationalism
in
with
the
french
capitalism
la
groupe
des
cooper
antes
built
a
new
tower
by
the
eatons
store
at
les
terraces
and
if
you
were
able
to
catch
urban
angel
on
cbss
crimetime
youd
see
it
as
the
welllit
one
with
doubleturrets
at
the
top
as
for
ontario
which
still
dominates
and
anchors
business
up
north
i
meant
new
companies
not
new
buildings
yes
primarily
in
quebec
and
in
alberta
sorry
i
musta
lost
you
in
that
verbose
blurb
its
not
really
insurance
if
you
dont
have
alternatives
well
you
have
to
realize
that
in
our
society
thats
like
saying
that
its
not
really
national
defence
because
you
cant
hire
your
own
rambo
squad
instead
or
even
opting
out
as
a
pacifist
true
but
i
would
be
more
comfortable
with
a
system
in
which
basic
care
provided
by
the
government
was
optional
not
mandatory
in
canada
and
germany
its
not
mandatory
however
it
is
negative
option
in
that
you
must
request
the
exemption
that
the
private
sector
will
not
provide
private
basic
coverage
if
offered
the
option
as
in
the
quebec
case
tells
me
something
about
what
they
know
either
way
the
transient
situations
are
hard
to
deal
with
since
the
changes
in
the
private
medical
care
resource
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
ability
of
people
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disasters
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
disease
a
doctor
needs
years
of
training
plus
internship
and
specialty
training
another
problem
with
the
us
system
that
should
be
resolved
doesnt
canada
have
something
like
ten
times
the
proportion
of
gps
to
specialists
that
the
us
does
yes
but
part
of
the
reason
is
that
our
most
of
our
markets
are
too
small
to
sustain
many
specialists
sometimes
not
even
one
so
you
pretty
well
have
to
be
a
gp
to
get
paid
and
if
you
do
get
the
training
the
doctors
monopoly
might
block
your
getting
of
a
licence
because
there
is
already
someone
in
the
business
and
who
can
not
fill
hisher
appointment
book
that
we
have
a
cma
doctors
monopoly
is
something
that
the
american
amaoriented
medical
lobby
never
tells
you
down
here
the
problem
is
in
a
specialty
your
skill
often
directly
correlates
to
your
pay
a
good
cardiologist
makes
more
than
a
merely
adequate
cardiologist
more
than
it
does
in
general
practice
in
that
circumstance
its
hard
to
blame
people
for
going
into
specialties
no
i
respect
people
who
do
specialties
okay
all
of
my
md
friends
are
but
theres
the
question
of
our
small
market
dynamics
up
north
if
anything
that
our
private
doctors
and
hospitals
sell
their
services
to
americans
to
generate
more
business
will
inflate
their
effective
population
served
and
thus
make
some
specialties
finally
viable
ie
there
will
be
enough
customers
we
just
do
not
have
enough
sick
canadians
in
absolute
numbers
otherwise
i
personally
think
an
approach
like
germanys
would
be
bestwhere
the
companies
compete
for
batches
of
people
rochester
a
little
east
of
us
was
able
to
get
almost
all
of
its
population
covered
that
way
uh
germany
basically
uses
our
method
with
their
many
sickness
funds
the
competition
is
fake
if
it
exists
at
all
because
theyre
all
interlinked
look
in
der
spiegel
or
stern
my
girlfriend
is
in
our
german
department
and
her
uncle
is
a
private
practicioner
in
saarbrucken
no
ads
for
health
insurance
while
canada
organizes
by
province
germany
organizes
the
paperwork
around
big
corporations
and
regional
offices
but
remember
that
we
have
provinces
that
have
the
same
population
as
some
major
german
corporations
germans
have
public
health
insurance
just
that
it
is
brokered
by
smaller
entities
actually
brokerage
of
basic
by
private
firms
wholl
sell
extra
insurance
to
fill
out
their
policies
sort
of
a
voucher
system
was
one
of
the
first
ideas
floated
in
canada
too
remember
the
germans
dont
have
hmos
a
telling
sign
cos
rochester
does
and
theyre
also
a
company
town
but
there
was
a
washington
post
article
recently
about
that
that
said
canadian
doctors
often
use
myelograms
instead
of
mris
which
require
spinal
injections
and
can
cause
seizures
and
headaches
mickey
kaus
in
the
new
republic
probably
spoke
for
most
americans
when
he
said
who
needs
that
i
think
people
here
generally
like
to
believe
they
can
easily
get
the
most
hightech
treatment
even
if
they
really
cant
afford
it
ill
have
to
let
a
canadian
md
jump
in
to
verify
that
claim
but
ive
come
to
learn
to
suspect
anything
in
the
american
press
about
our
system
if
much
or
some
of
it
were
true
youd
have
to
take
us
for
idiots
for
tolerating
it
and
given
that
our
insurance
was
installed
during
a
period
when
there
were
only
liberal
and
tory
governments
federally
and
provincially
and
the
socialists
are
still
chafing
they
wouldve
pressed
for
real
socialized
medicine
to
fix
things
think
about
it
after
all
we
are
using
the
us
as
a
metric
to
make
comparison
both
for
keepingupwiththejoneses
as
for
confirming
that
we
did
something
right
