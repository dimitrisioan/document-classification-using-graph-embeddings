reno
killed
the
waco
children
she
is
responsible
for
their
deaths
she
should
resign
immediately
she
should
have
aside
from
the
fact
that
i
disagree
w
you
she
did
offer
to
resign
and
the
president
rejected
the
offer
she
was
willing
to
take
responsibility
and
which
is
a
helluva
lot
more
than
any
republican
attorney
general
ever
did
btw
why
all
the
crocodile
tears
over
wasting
a
few
religious
nuts
who
wanted
to
be
wasted
anyway
we
just
got
back
from
wasting
a
few
hundred
thousand
religious
nuts

the
middle
east
and
everybody
cheered
