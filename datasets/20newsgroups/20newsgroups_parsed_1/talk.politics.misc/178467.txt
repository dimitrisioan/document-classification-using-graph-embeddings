funny
but
ive
seen
a
lot
more
than
or
seconds
of
that
video
and
i
still
think
the
police
involved
were
guilty
i
dont
think
theres
any
excuse
they
could
possibly
come
up
with
that
would
make
what
they
did
ok
i
dont
care
if
rodney
king
was
satan
himself
theres
just
no
excuse
now
whether
they
did
it
because
he
was
black
or
they
did
it
because
they
wanted
to
beat
up
on
somebody
they
were
arresting
is
another
entirely
separate
question
that
i
have
insufficient
information
to
make
any
kind
of
conclusion
about
how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a
bunch
of
cops
putting
their
lives
o
n
the
line
day
in
and
day
out
who
are
afraid
as
hell
of
a
large
black
guy
that
took
a
large
amount
of
punishment
and
refused
submit
oh
yeah
did
you
watch
the
start
of
the
video
when
king
got
up
out
of
his
prone
postion
and
charge
the
cops
sorry
the
video
cuts
both
was
when
you
sit
and
watch
it
start
to
finish
i
have
to
agree
with
you
the
police
may
have
carried
it
a
bit
too
far
but
rodney
king
was
no
angel
either
and
i
dont
think
any
guilty
verdicts
should
have
been
returned
im
sure
you
know
why
they
handed
down
guilty
verdicts
on
two
of
the
officers
its
quite
simple
really
it
was
a
compromise
to
avoid
rioting
in
the
places
where
minorities
think
its
right
to
riot
i
hate
to
say
this
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
them
riot
with
everyone
prepared
it
would
be
open
season
if
your
skin
was
even
slightly
brown
hey
my
motto
is
you
dont
fuck
with
me
or
my
stuff
and
you
dont
get
killed
its
just
that
simple
