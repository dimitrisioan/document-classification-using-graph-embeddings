i
dont
know
what
you
as
a
white
male
did
i
do
know
what
white
males
as
a
class
have
done
theyve
invented
the
light
bulb
the
automobile
the
airplane
printing
with
movable
type
photography
computers
the
electric
guitar
anasthesia
rocket
powered
space
flight
the
computer
electricity
the
telephone
tv
motion
pictures
penecillinsp
telescopes
nylon
and
the
xray
machine
two
glaring
errors
here
first
white
males
dont
do
anything
as
a
class
individual
white
males
invented
those
things
which
means
nothing
to
white
males
as
a
whole
second
you
neglected
to
mention
charles
manson
hitler
mccarthy
jack
the
ripper
ted
bundy
and
a
whole
slew
of
individuals
who
have
done
horrible
evil
things
if
white
males
can
take
the
credit
for
our
fellow
white
males
boons
we
must
also
take
the
blame
for
our
fellows
blights
i
claim
we
deserve
neither
credit
nor
blame
for
these
things
we
are
told
by
us
congresswoman
barbara
jordan
that
we
are
biologically
incapable
of
compassion
shes
full
of
shit
we
are
told
by
susan
brownmiller
that
were
all
rapists
and
thats
all
we
are
shes
full
of
shit
were
told
by
catherine
comins
that
a
false
rape
charge
is
actually
good
for
us
shes
full
of
shit
we
are
told
by
the
feminist
lawyers
that
we
are
not
to
be
trusted
with
children
theyre
full
of
shit
we
are
told
by
newsweek
magazine
that
we
are
poor
sports
if
we
complain
newsweek
is
full
of
shit
the
point
ladies
and
gents
michael
is
not
entirely
correct
in
his
theory
that
because
members
of
our
race
and
gender
made
great
advances
the
race
and
gender
as
a
whole
deserve
more
respect
than
they
receive
white
males
do
deserve
to
be
treated
better
than
they
are
being
treated
but
not
for
that
reason
and
the
malebashers
he
quoted
are
repugnant
hatemongers
no
better
than
the
chauvinists
they
despise
so
no
ones
right
as
usual
white
males
need
to
wake
up
and
realize
that
theyre
being
unfair
yes
but
everyone
else
needs
to
wake
up
and
realize
that
being
unfair
right
back
is
disgusting
racist
and
sexist
why
cant
we
learn
to
treat
everyone
fairly
without
generalizing
what
stupidity
gene
makes
this
so
difficult
id
like
to
buy
the
world
a
clue
the
word
that
is
missing
in
this
whole
discourse
is
not
the
b
word
or
the
h
word
or
even
the
n
or
w
words
it
is
the
l
word
loser
thats
right
when
we
boil
all
the
crap
out
of
this
argument
it
is
all
about
winning
and
losing
and
nothing
else
let
me
explain
remember
the
eighties
no
excuses
nobody
who
can
handle
a
mail
buffer
can
claim
they
are
too
young
to
remember
ronald
reagan
yet
the
eighties
were
about
how
america
learned
to
win
once
again
then
wouldnt
you
know
we
won
so
well
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
win
no
cold
war
to
endure
no
nuclear
holocaust
no
more
worlds
to
conquer
we
forgot
about
outer
space
long
ago
the
kind
of
overwhelming
no
holds
barred
success
that
killed
alexander
the
great
yes
there
were
a
few
little
problems
along
the
way
stock
market
meltdown
here
an
sl
bailout
there
a
few
revolts
and
crazy
middle
eastern
dictators
to
contend
with
but
as
tacitus
would
tell
ya
the
god
augustus
never
had
it
so
good
in
the
meantime
there
is
guilt
for
winning
maybe
a
fear
that
one
doesnt
deserve
ones
bounty
or
success
so
there
is
a
kinder
and
gentler
type
of
politician
these
days
bill
clinton
affirmative
action
and
lots
of
discourse
about
people
who
dont
get
it
for
those
of
us
in
the
winning
business
this
kind
of
talk
is
mildly
irritating
but
there
is
still
no
suggestion
of
losing
but
what
do
we
find
now
to
put
it
mildy
the
stereotype
of
our
white
male
nonwinner
is
woody
hayes
in
the
rose
bowl
punching
out
photojournalists
when
those
california
fruits
and
nuts
steal
another
one
with
a
hail
mary
pass
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
whole
idea
behind
three
yards
and
a
cloud
of
dust
is
to
wear
your
opponent
down
until
he
collapses
in
the
final
period
but
woody
just
used
his
fists
uzzies
seem
to
be
the
weapon
of
choice
these
days
who
is
dfens
anyway
the
answer
is
as
plain
as
the
horn
rims
on
your
face
the
guy
is
michael
douglas
posing
as
a
loser
this
is
known
as
controversial
casting
but
that
baggy
shortsleeved
white
shirt
sure
does
look
natural
on
mike
doesnt
it
gordon
gekko
will
never
look
the
same
though
woody
always
dressed
that
way
did
we
really
expect
gekko
to
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
that
kind
of
wardrobe
without
putting
up
a
fuss
what
we
are
starting
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
bashing
dfens
is
the
same
game
as
bashing
that
poor
african
american
slug
that
clint
eastwood
used
to
blow
away
all
the
time
as
that
archwasp
male
gender
george
c
scott
declaimed
americans
traditionally
love
to
win
they
love
a
winner
and
will
not
tolerate
a
loser
and
so
on
the
political
implications
are
simple
if
as
many
socialists
and
democrats
do
you
consider
society
a
finite
pie
to
a
apportioned
in
some
equitable
way
then
you
have
to
worry
about
who
is
a
winner
and
who
is
a
loser
to
tell
whose
side
you
are
on
that
could
be
black
women
today
asian
homosexuals
tommorrow
and
yes
indeed
white
men
some
yet
to
be
determined
day
when
the
balance
of
the
pie
has
finally
swung
against
that
minority
or
you
can
just
blow
the
whole
thing
off
and
say
as
do
most
conservatives
and
all
the
libertarians
and
act
is
if
you
didnt
care
whos
winning
and
whos
losing
in
some
cases
you
might
say
something
about
make
sure
the
game
is
fair
equality
of
opportunity
not
of
condition
in
the
latter
case
you
might
be
able
to
identify
yourself
as
a
neoconservative
or
a
neoliberal
depending
on
how
much
you
want
to
limit
the
pot
either
way
you
go
the
way
of
the
winner
is
no
longer
the
way
to
be
popular
at
least
after
you
graduate
from
high
school
but
youll
still
be
popular
at
high
school
reunions
but
it
beats
being
a
nerd
as
i
would
imagine
michael
douglas
would
now
agree
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
only
way
to
go
even
in
hollywood
which
treats
losers
worse
than
any
other
place
in
america
except
for
new
york
and
washington
dc
and
even
in
columbus
ohio
which
produced
alex
keaton
but
no
champion
football
teams
in
the
eighties
and
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineties
id
like
to
see
more
winners
in
this
society
regardless
of
race
gender
religious
preference
and
sexual
orientation
maybe
we
should
even
let
a
few
more
of
them
be
white
men
we
should
definitely
let
the
buckeyes
win
the
rose
bowl
someday
bill
r
the
only
proposals
in
the
senate
that
i
my
opinions
do
not
represent
have
seen
fit
to
mention
are
particularly
those
of
my
employer
or
praiseworthy
or
particularly
scandalous
ones
any
government
agency
it
seems
to
me
that
the
historians
foremost
bill
riggs
duty
is
to
ensure
that
virtue
is
remembered
and
to
deter
evil
words
and
deeds
with
the
fear
of
posteritys
damnation
