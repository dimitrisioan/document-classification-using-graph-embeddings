writes
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
of
course
they
did
otherwise
they
wouldnt
have
staged
the
raid
in
the
first
place
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a
warant
on
the
place
by
ludicrously
underarmed
and
unprotected
police
if
anyone
on
the
net
cares
to
suggest
a
sure
fire
method
of
bringing
the
murderes
of
four
police
officers
to
justice
perhaps
we
could
hear
it
napalming
seems
a
bit
redundant
the
stupidity
was
in
the
batf
mindset
were
from
washington
we
know
better
execute
plan
a
storm
the
compound
in
a
noknock
the
locals
are
gullible
rubes
who
cares
that
they
served
warrents
by
knocking
on
the
door
such
an
old
fashioned
out
dated
method
of
law
enforcement
anyway
got
ta
have
the
latest
armament
technology
doncha
know
sweet
baby
buddah

clown
