richard
wojcik
writes
directly
contradicted
by
the
nejm
study
that
compared
crime
in
seattle
and
vancouver
bc
the
nongun
rates
were
roughly
the
same
for
both
cities
the
difference
in
violent
crime
rates
was
almost
totally
gunrelated
and
as
was
not
pointed
out
in
the
study
but
in
critiques
of
it
two
seperate
articles
by
james
wright
and
david
kopel
come
to
mind
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
difference
was
also
almost
entirely
minority
related
that
is
the
gun
crime
rate
skyrocketed
for
poor
minorities
blacks
and
hispanics
primarily
while
when
you
compared
the
white
majority
they
were
virutally
identical
many
of
the
people
who
never
read
the
nejm
article
believe
that
this
critique
is
valid
in
fact
the
study
explores
the
minority
issue
at
length
and
cites
studies
to
back
up
its
contention
that
poverty
not
minority
type
is
the
relevant
factor
in
violence
statistics
perhaps
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear
minorities
in
the
us
correlate
with
poverty
this
isnt
good
and
we
should
address
it
but
we
shouldnt
ignore
that
minorities
and
poverty
do
tend
to
go
together
does
vancouver
have
a
consistantly
poor
population
drawn
along
racial
lines
if
it
doesnt
then
assumptions
of
being
able
to
compare
minority
vs
majority
in
both
cities
is
questionable
at
best
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
those
areas
implemented
gun
control
because
of
the
high
rates
true
only
to
a
certain
extent
take
washington
dc
where
gun
control
was
instituted
while
it
had
crime
problems
true
but
that
crime
proceeded
to
explode
afterwards
similarly
for
new
york
actually
i
dont
know
whether
any
serious
studies
have
been
done
for
both
cities
usenetstyle
statistical
arguments
are
not
very
serious
usually
involving
people
sitting
by
computers
with
the
latest
world
almanac
figures
i
had
heard
of
a
study
on
washington
dc
that
seemed
to
indicate
a
significant
drop
in
gunrelated
violence
there
after
the
laws
were
implemented
i
heard
gary
kleck
comment
on
the
radio
that
he
thought
the
decline
in
suicide
rates
was
related
to
the
new
laws
but
he
doubted
their
affect
on
other
gunrelated
violence
i
have
never
seen
a
report
on
the
study
nor
have
any
of
my
progun
friends
had
much
to
say
about
that
report
remember
you
cant
just
say
that
crime
increases
indicate
a
failure
of
the
laws
to
affect
crime
rates
you
dont
know
whether
the
rate
of
increase
would
have
been
different
without
the
laws
if
the
rate
of
increase
over
a
period
of
several
years
remains
unchanged
or
increases
i
think
its
not
a
far
jump
to
say
that
the
laws
are
not
effective
no
you
cant
sit
down
and
say
that
things
wouldnt
have
been
worse
i
dont
have
a
crystal
ball
and
neither
do
you
however
that
road
leads
us
to
a
place
where
it
is
impossible
to
critique
any
action
if
it
gets
down
to
be
it
might
have
been
worse
without
them
then
there
is
no
valid
objection
which
im
sure
would
amuse
certain
people
to
no
end
you
dont
know
whether
the
laws
prevented
a
threefoldincrease
or
failed
to
stop
a
twofold
increase
so
weve
got
a
situation
where
we
have
several
options
the
crime
rate
decreased
obviously
gun
control
worked
the
crime
rate
remained
the
same
it
would
have
been
worse
without
gun
control
the
crime
rate
increased
perhaps
the
laws
prevented
an
even
bigger
increase
cute
testing
ground
weve
got
all
responses
support
the
proposition
that
gun
control
works
the
question
is
this
did
washington
dc
experiance
an
increase
in
its
violent
andor
gun
crime
rate
which
was
greater
than
the
pattern
indicated
prior
to
the
implemented
gun
control
laws
if
it
did
then
the
suggestion
that
the
problem
the
gun
control
laws
were
designed
to
control
did
not
exist
in
their
entirety
prior
to
the
gun
control
laws
