low
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
actually
what
the
study
shows
is
that
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
said
they
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
said
they
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
the
point
being
that
what
people
say
and
what
they
acutally
do
may
be
different
it
is
interesting
that
this
clip
from
the
newspaper
did
not
mention
that
difference
maybe
it
is
conservative
media
bias
the
figures
on
homosexuality
in
the
study
released
wednesday
by
the
alan
guttmacher
institute
are
significantly
lower
than
the
percent
figure
that
has
been
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
since
it
was
published
in
the
kinsey
report
