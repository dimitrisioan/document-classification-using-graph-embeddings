are
you
going
to

you
presented
show
just
thisthat
only
about
of
child
molesters
are
gay
and
thus
are
not
overrepresented
with

to
the
general
incidence

something
besides
a

article
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
isnt
this
irrelevant

shows
something

doesnt
regardless
of
what
other
studies
show
admit
it
what
you
showed
to
us
doesnt
prove
that
gay
