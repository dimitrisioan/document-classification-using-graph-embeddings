just
try
to
justify
the
war
on
drugs
i
dare
you
a
friend
of
mine
who
smoke
pot
every
day
and
last
tuesday
took
hits
of
acid
is
still
having
trouble
aiming
for
the
bowl
when
he
takes
a
dump
dont
as
me
how
i
just
have
seen
the
results
boy
i
really
wish
we
we
cut
the
drug
war
and
have
more
people
screwed
up
in
the
head
im
sorry
about
your
friend
really
but
this
anecdote
does
nothing
to
justify
the
war
on
drugs
if
anything
it
demonstrates
that
the
war
is
a
miserable
failure
what
it
demonstrates
is
that
people
will
take
drugs
if
they
want
to
legal
or
not
perhaps
if
your
friend
were
taking
legal
regulated
drugs
under
a
doctors
supervision
he
might
not
be
in
the
position
hes
in
now
i
do
agree
with
you
in
a
way
the
war
on
drugs
has
failed
but
in
my
opinion
that
doesnt
mean
we
have
to
give
up
only
change
the
tactics
for
instance
here
are
how
some
penalties
should
be
changed
dealing
coke
death
dealing
heroin
death
dealing
pot
death
dealing
crack
death
the
list
goes
on
and
on
just
kidding
however
on
a
more
serious
note
i
do
believe
that
we
should
take
some
money
away
from
the
foriegn
operations
in
south
america
and
costly
border
interdiction
efforts
dont
think
im
going
to
say
spend
it
to
educate
people
because
i
know
plenty
of
educated
dopers
actually
spend
it
on
things
like
drug
treatment
programs
i
saw
an
interesting
story
on
minutes
about
how
the
british
actually
prescribe
and
addict
his
recommended
dosage
and
try
to
ween
him
off
from
it
or
cut
the
amount
down
to
levels
where
it
is
acceptable
sounds
good
so
far
from
what
i
heard
with
a
decrease
in
cost
lower
addiction
rates
by
wiping
out
the
dealers
markets
etc
but
that
was
the
only
thing
i
have
heard
about
it
however
legalizing
it
and
just
sticking
some
drugs
in
gas
stations
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
plus
i
have
never
heard
of
a
recommended
dosage
for
drugs
like
crack
ecstasy
chrystal
meth
and
lsd
the
minute
report
said
it
worked
with
cocaine
cigarettes
pot
and
heroin
