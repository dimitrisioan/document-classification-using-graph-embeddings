re
welcome
to
police
state
usa
in
article
lawrence
c
smith
writes
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
this
is
stupid
that
is
no
paranoid
assertion
it
is
testamony
from
surviving
witnesses
and
the
batf
has
no
tanks
nor
am
i
aware
of
either
the
batf
or
the
fbi
using
any
until
yesterday
when
they
use
maximum
force
they
do
just
what
they
did
that
first
day
that
got
four
officers
killed
these
surviving
witnesses
being
members
of
which
cult
pray
tell
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a
warant
on
the
place
by
ludicrously
underarmed
and
unprotected
police
underarmed
you
flabberghast
me
they
were
loaded
for
bear
and
every
picture
shows
them
wearing
bulletproof
vests
they
were
using
concussion
grenades
and
fullauto
weapons
what
was
missing
lowyield
tacnukes
this
is
a
transparent
attempt
to
retcon
a
justification
for
the
ridiculous
amount
of
force
used
both
initially
and
yesterday
you
should
be
ashamed
we
were
having
a
discussion
about
whether
bush
would
have
done
anything
differently
on
the
basis
of
panama
grenada
tripoli
kewait
etc
we
decided
that
bush
would
have
asked
for
a
surgical
airstrike
or
used
a
cruise
missile
some
people
suggested
that
he
would
have
used
the
nuke
warhead
cruise
others
pointed
out
that
he
would
be
too
cheap
to
use
em
what
was
missing
armoured
vehicles
if
anyone
on
the
net
cares
to
suggest
a
sure
fire
method
of
bringing
the
murderes
of
four
police
officers
to
justice
perhaps
we
could
hear
it
they
had
a
surefire
method
keep
them
bottled
up
and
talk
them
to
death
or
surrender
without
giving
him
justification
for
some
looneytune
religious
stunt
phil
ive
been
reading
your
postings
for
months
and
im
convinced
that
you
will
back
anything
no
matter
how
damaging
it
may
be
to
yours
or
anyone
elses
rights
if
you
think
it
will
hurt
people
you
dont
like
its
people
with
that
attitude
that
set
up
the
preconditions
for
the
holocaust
a
process
that
is
in
place
now
in
this
country
even
if
the
tattered
pitiful
remains
of
the
constitution
is
slowing
its
progress
this
isnt
a
libertarian
issue
others
may
argue
that
line
but
from
a
strictly
constitutional
view
of
a
democratic
govt
what
the
fbi
and
batf
did
was
wrong
wrong
wrong
even
if
their
reasons
for
trying
to
arrest
koresh
were
right
anything
that
leads
to
the
deaths
of
children
if
nothing
else
touches
your
stoney
heart
is
wrong
no
matter
who
pushed
the
button
for
gods
sake
man
get
your
morality
back
the
person
who
murdered
children
was
koresh
he
kept
them
there
and
brought
about
their
deaths
deliberately
you
may
consider
that
i
am
a
complete
bastard
and
a
not
very
nice
chap
thats
quite
true
i
dont
pretend
to
be
being
nice
is
what
amateurs
try
to
do
if
you
want
to
talk
politics
you
are
talking
hard
decisions
such
as
whether
the
lives
of
the
troops
should
be
risked
attempting
to
rescue
the
children
anyone
who
has
held
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
since
fdr
has
held
the
threat
that
if
the
usa
or
its
allies
were
to
be
threatened
then
the
usa
would
risk
nuclear
holocaust
in
order
to
protect
freedom
beleive
it
or
not
that
is
not
the
sort
of
threat
that
nice
chaps
make
do
they
have
a
gun
nutters
section
of
the
us
version
of
cnd
by
any
chance
there
are
cases
where
society
has
to
be
protected
from
madmen
such
as
koresh
or
hitler
if
it
were
not
for
the
consideration
of
the
children
in
there
the
question
of
the
tactics
to
be
used
would
not
be
a
matter
of
anything
but
academic
significance
it
is
not
for
the
govt
to
prevent
people
from
commiting
mass
suicide
the
latest
reports
are
that
cult
members
were
shot
attempting
to
leave
the
compound
by
koresh
loyalists
during
the
fire
if
proven
that
would
entail
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
of
those
who
want
to
promote
koresh
as
some
sort
of
role
model
or
hero
i
need
hardly
add
that
it
is
koresh
that
has
created
the
holocaust
in
this
case
by
the
deliberate
arson
of
the
ranch
