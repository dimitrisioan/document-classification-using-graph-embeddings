how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a

of
cops
putting
their
lives
on
the
line
day

day
out
who
are
afraid
as
hell
of
a
large
black
guy
that
took
a
large
amount
of
punishment
and
refused
submit
im
curious
why
you
think
that
particular
adjective
is
important
im
curious
why
you
took
a
beign
statement
and
crossposted
it
to
several
different
news
groups
including
something
along
the
lines
of
altdiscrimination
exsqueeze
me
i
saw
your
original
post
in
altdiscrimination
your
post
was
crossposted
to
three
groups
my
followup
was
crossposted
to
two
of
those
three
omitting
socmotss

instead
of
engaging
in
metadiscussion
off
the
topic
could
you
answer
the
question
posed
if
your
statement
is
so
beign
you
should
have
no
trouble
politely
responding
to
a
polite
query
