sachs
says
in
article
broward
horne
says
it
sure
does
appear
that
way
doesnt
it
the
attitude
that
people
are
stupid
if
they
dont
agree
with
you
is
not
going
to
bring
you
great
success
in
life
free
advice
there
whew
mark
what
on
earth
makes
you
think
i
give
a
fuck
about
being
a
success
particularly
now
when
ill
just
the
hell
taxed
out
of
me
oh
this
is
excellent
that
was
hardly
the
point
was
it
i
was
commenting
on
this
alltoocommon
republican
attitude
that
if
people
disagree
with
us
they
must
be
idiots
they
must
be
sheep
being
led
around
by
the
evil
liberal
media
conspiracy
this
is
a
dangerous
attitude
indeed
because
its
not
a
very
big
step
from
people
are
sheep
they
cant
think
for
themselves
to
people
are
sheep
and
need
firm
leadership
from
we
who
know
better
this
sort
of
attitude
makes
me
worry
about
whatll
happen
to
the
united
states
if
the
extremist
wing
of
the
republican
party
ever
gets
back
into
power
again
holy
christ
hey
this
is
a
governmentfunded
newsgroup
lets
have
some
separation
of
church
and
state
damn
it
besides
lets
ahem
examine
the
record
shall
we
broward
clintons
going
to
taxe
the
holy
fuck
out
of
you
mark
no
hes
not
only
month
i
still
get
a
laugh
out
of
this
one
more
like
broward
clintons
going
to
raise
your
income
taxes
by
over
mark
no
hes
not
only
about
broward
silence
want
some
more
free
predictions
ok
i
predict
that
in
the
republicans
will
still
be
bitter
yeah
yeah
i
know
its
not
very
impressive
to
predict
things
that
are
inevitable
so
i
propose
that
we
destroy
the
moon
neatly
solving
that
problem
your
blood
pressure
just
went
up
mark
sachs
is
disclaimer
if
psu

try
to
charge
me
for
them
