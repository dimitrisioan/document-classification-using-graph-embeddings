boy
it
looks
like
the
wod
is
working
really
good
to
stop
people
from
being
screwed
up
in
the
head
given
that
example
issue
your
friend
got
his
drugslegal
or
not
legal
hell
continue
to
get
them
issue
why
should
i
as
somebody
who
does
not
use
illegal
drugs
and
who
is
not
screwed
up
have
to
pay
for
this
idiots
problems
he
s
not
doing
anybody
any
harm
except
himself
the
wod
on
the
other
hand
is
a
n
immediate
threat
to
my
life
and
livelyhood
tell
me
why
i
should
sacrafice
this
to
that
hello
is
there
anybody
in
there
you
think
you
have
to
pay
for
this
idiots
problem
now
whos
going
to
pay
for
the
ballooning
number
of
addicts
and
all
of
the
associated
problems
with
them
i
dont
even
want
to
think
about
it
with
hillary
in
the
white
house
and
an
administration
that
feels
our
pain
look
if
you
were
truly
for
lower
taxation
and
less
government
you
would
not
be
advocating
the
wod
ever
wonder
why
the
wod
is
a
bipartisan
issue
no
harm
but
to
himself
what
about
when
he
drives
his
school
bus
full
of
kids
into
a
train
when
he
gets
stoned
and
drives
up
on
a
sidewalk
and
kills
people
when
he
lives
off
me
on
welfare
for
the
rest
of
his
life
ridiculous
i
cant
imagine
anyone
this
stupid
forgive
me
for
flaming
but
this
is
sooooooo
obvious
tell
me
why
any
of
the
above
cases
can
not
be
caused
be
a
legal
drug
viz
alcohol
or
are
you
for
having
a
war
on
that
too
now
ill
tell
you
more
people
are
killed
by
alcoholrelated
accidents
than
all
other
drugs
combined
by
far
probably
because
more
people
have
access
to
alchohol
it
is
legal
you
know
the
problem
with
the
wod
is
that
it
has
no
bite
sending
the
slimy
bastards
to
the
chair
for
selling
drugs
to
kids
now
theres
some
bit
yeah
thats
it
send
a
kid
from
the
innercity
who
has
no
other
viable
means
to
make
money
and
turns
to
selling
drugs
to
an
overcrowded
federal
prison
where
he
learns
to
do
real
crime
of
course
this
kid
would
be
much
better
off
selling
crack
to
his
neighborhood
and
helping
in
its
demise
without
drug
money
being
pumped
into
these
blights
from
the
affluent
outside
there
would
be
no
crime
who
would
they
steal
from
each
other
drugs
bring
money
into
the
community
just
like
any
other
business
would
except
that
since
drugs
are
illegal
the
economy
is
an
underground
one
and
if
those
drugs
were
legal
the
neighborhood
could
legally
go
to
hell
a
selfsustaining
underground
economy
can
only
proliferate
by
a
constant
willful
infusion
of
money
from
the
outside
if
you
take
away
drug
laws
you
put
an
end
to
the
underground
economy
and
therefore
to
largescale
crime
and
if
we
made
murder
legal
we
would
put
an
end
to
murder
as
a
crime
kids
in
the
innercities
are
faced
with
a
very
tough
life
growing
up
there
or
selling
drugs
and
having
everything
at
their
fingertips
instantly
many
kids
choose
selling
drugs
they
sell
products
to
people
who
want
to
buy
them
they
make
money
off
of
rich
white
kids
from
the
suburbs
then
they
go
to
prison
then
they
become
hardened
criminals
and
learn
that
youre
much
better
off
stealing
carstereos
in
the
suburbs
because
all
the
police
forces
are
spending
all
their
money
in
the
inner
city
saving
people
from
themselves
what
you
can
bring
up
all
the
examples
you
want
about
crackbabies
and
whathaveyou
the
solution
never
has
anything
to
do
with
the
laws
crack
is
illegal
so
you
are
saying
crack
babies
who
are
that
way
legally
are
okay
no
social
problem
however
great
is
worth
destroying
the
freedom
in
america
the
destruction
of
freedom
is
never
an
answer
to
any
social
problem
you
cant
even
walk
down
the
street
at
night
alone
in
america
because
of
drugs
freedom

ass
