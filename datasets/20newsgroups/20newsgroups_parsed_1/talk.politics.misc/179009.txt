mark
wilson
says
many
environmentalists
attributed
the
drought
in
the
us
to
global
warming
but
researchers
with
the
national
center
for
atmospheric
research
in
educated
and
open
minded
environmentalists
do
not
one
of
the
most
effective
come
backs
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
everybody
who
disagrees
with
me
is
stupid
and
closed
minded
no
what
it
means
is
that
i
like
a
majority
of
environmental
scientistsresearchers
agree
that
el
ninola
nina
and
the
southern
oscillations
are
the
systems
involoved
in
that
climatic
phenomena
categorized
by
humans
as
a
drought
furthermore
in
response
to
an
earlier
message
the
us
est
output
of
sulfur
dioxide
mill
tons
was
equivalent
to
the
entire
output
by
the
recent
eruption
of
mt
pinautubosp
currently
world
carbon
dioxide
levels
set
at
approx
ppm
in
the
past
years
it
has
never
gone
above
this
info
was
found
using
ice
core
samples
from
the
joint
frenchrussianus
vostok
project
furthermore
the
background
emmisions
of
chlorine
compounds
into
the
atmoshpere
is
about
ppb
annually
it
now
sits
at
this
overwhelming
datainfo
is
found
in
the
world
resources
doc
published
by
oxford
university
the
ozone
hole
in
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
keeps
getting
bigger
and
stickin
around
longer
whilst
skeptics
ponder
how
wrong
or
corrupt
all
this
data
from
government
and
international
scientific
institutions
is
it
is
a
pity
that
if
the
skeptics
are
wrong
and
we
base
our
complacency
on
their
limbaugh
psycho
babble
then
we
will
find
ourselves
strapped
by
limited
options
with
which
to
rectify
the
primal
engineering
of
our
industrial
age
