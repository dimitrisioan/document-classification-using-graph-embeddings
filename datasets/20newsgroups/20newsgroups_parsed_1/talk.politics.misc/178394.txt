race

even
though
this
city
phoenix
has
a
relatively
small
black
population
black
people
seem
to
be
responsible
for
a
disproportionate
amount
of
violent
crime
yesterday
black
men
robbed
a
cafeteria
beat
the
employees
for
no
apparent
reason
and
shot
one
dead
even
though
they
were
being
cooperative
a
few
days
ago
a
car
full
of
black
men
opened
fire
on
a
car
containing
a
young
white
couple
and
their
baby
possibly
because
they
didnt
like
the
way
the
man
was
driving
the
baby
was
slightly
injured
these
incidents
are
not
even
unusual
even
if
a
white
person
starts
out
without
racial
prejudice
as
after
all
we
all
do
and
no
one
teaches
them
to
be
prejudiced
its
sometimes
hard
to
see
how
they
can
avoid
becoming
so
based
on
their
own
observations
and
instinct
for
selfpreservation
we
always
taught
our
children
that
racial
prejudice
is
wrong
not
only
bad
but
also
mistaken
but
how
do
you
counteract
the
effect
of
these
kinds
of
incidents
whats
the
answer
how
can
we
work
against
racial
prejudice
when
incidents
like
this
keep
fanning
the
flames
what
can
we
say
to
deny
that
racial
prejudice
is
a
rational
response
to
our
environment
is
it
should
we
since
the
s
i
have
thought
the
only
hope
is
through
integration
based
on
ignoring
race
and
treating
each
person
as
an
individual
but
so
many
either
preach
divisiveness
by
emphasizing
race
or
validate
racism
by
their
actions
where
does
it
lead

you
can
start
by
teaching
your
children
that
the
perpetrators
of
crimes
no
more
represent
the
black
community
than
racist
hateful
whites
represent
the
majority
culture
although
there
are
many
ethnic
minorities
who
have
fallen
into
the
very
trap
that
you
are
struggling
with
and
believe
otherwise
the
trap
is
the
easy
way
out
for
yourself
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
realize
that
the
demographics
related
to
the
crimes
you
speak
of
have
less
to
do
with
race
and
much
to
do
with
socioeconomic
status
and
disenfranchisement
youre
going
to
find
higher
crime
within
any
community
comprised
of
any
ethnic
group
or
subgroup
that
has
become
dysfunctional
whatever
the
factors
leading
to
that
dysfunction
with
ethnic
minorities
it
is
more
usually
than
not
as
i
said
socioeconomic
disenfranchisement
if
for
example
you
lived
in
an
area
where
there
were
very
few
blacks
but
quite
a
few
poorforgenerations
whites
youd
see
the
crime
statistics
reflecting
the
dysfunction
of
those
white
people
would
you
then
worry
about
whther
your
children
would
begin
to
see
whites
as
undesireable
or
whatever
the
trap
springs
into
action
when
our
innate
compunction
to
define
us
and
other
raises
its
little
voice
the
trap
becomes
dangerous
when
we
stop
to
listen
to
that
little
voice
and
stop
thinking
like
rational
humans
its
interesting
that
blacks
are
traditionally
seen
as
the
or
the
most
criminal
element
in
many
of
our
urban
areas
i
dont
know
the
racial
makeup
of
phoenix
so
i
cant
speak
to
your
situation
however
i
live
in
san
francisco
a
city
that
loves
to
tout
its
ethnic
diversity
here
we
have
black
gangs
hispanic
gangs
asian
yes
the
model
minority
gangs
and
even
a
few
white
gangs
the
asian
gangs
have
become
a
particularly
troublesome
element
for
law
enforcement
here
mainly
due
i
think
to
their
propensity
for
engaging
in
organized
criminal
activities
but
ask
people
on
the
street
and
theyll
outof
times
tell
you
that
black
gangs
and
crime
are
what
they
most
fear
during
the
disturbance
in
los
angeles
last
year
many
of
the
rioters
and
looters
were
not
black
some
were
even
white
i
remember
being
amazed
at
television
news
scenes
that
showed
looting
mobs
where
there
were
maybe
one
or
two
blacks
at
most
my
perceptions
gleaned
from
tv
news
were
further
corroborated
by
numerous
friends
and
relatives
that
live
in
los
angeles
this
may
have
been
the
countrys
first
truly
multiethnic
riot
yet
i
know
from
facetoface
and
online
discussion
that
in
the
minds
of
america
the
popular
perception
is
that
it
was
a
black
riot
in
closing
id
like
to
say
that
you
raise
some
interesting
points
that
really
need
discussion
our
country
has
spent
too
long
ignoring
the
racism
and
its
attendant
ills
that
is
very
much
a
part
of
our
culture
as
a
people
we
are
afraid
to
face
up
to
some
hurtful
truths
and
the
problem
becomes
compounded
daily
we
can
not
afford
to
do
it
much
longer
i
truly
believe
that
the
wellbeing
of
all
of
us
depends
on
changing
our
current
course
of
denial
and
repression
i
wish
you
and
your
children
and
all
other
people
of
all
colors
luck
in
avoiding
the
trap
