can
someone
tell
me
why
when
mr
cramer
spouts
on
about
homosexuals
he
only
addresses
homosexual
men
and
never
in
any
post
ive
read
addressed
lesbians
granted
i
stopped
reading
all
his
posts
long
long
ago
so
perhaps
i
missed
something
because
women
very
very
seldom
molest
children
unhunh
yeah
right
sure
you
know
that
list
of
things
that
are
stereotypically
american
mom
apple
pie
etc
you
dont
hear
too
many
stories
about
mom
being
a
child
molester
because
such
stories
would
simply
be
unamerican
but
that
doesnt
say
that
it
doesnt
happen
