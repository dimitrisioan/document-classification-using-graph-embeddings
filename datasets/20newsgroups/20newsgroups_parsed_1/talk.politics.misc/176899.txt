unfortunately
homosexuals
dont
believe
in
this
concept
of
freedom
they
believe
that
they
have
a
right
to
force
people
to
hire
them
rent
to
them
and
do
business
with
them
regardless
of
the
feelings

oh
clayton
youre
so
good
so
consistent
so
predictable
yup
thats
right
they
these
homosexual
people
want
to
force
you
to
ignore
whats
none
of
your
fucking
business
ie
i
will
explain
slowly
their
sexual
orientation
should
be
irrelevant
as
irrelevant
as
their
gender
skin
colour
religious
affiliation
attitude
to
handgun
ownership
etc
they
want
to
force
you
to
hire
the
best
person
for
the
job
rent
the
accomodation
to
the
person
who
will
look
after
it
do
business
with
whoever
will
make
you
money
yet
when
a
law
was
proposed
for
virginia
that
extended
this
philosophy
to
cigarette
smokers
so
that
people
who
smoked
away
from
the
work
couldnt
be
discriminated
against
by
employers
the
liberal
gov
wilder
vetoed
it
which
shows
that
liberals
dont
give
a
damn
about
best
person
for
the
job
its
just
a
power
play
