sigh
youre
absolutely
right
we
have
no
political
power
whatsoever
if
only
that
were
true
in
california
homosexuals
have
enough
power
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
the
only
moral
were
imposing
is
one
which
you
supposedly
embrace
already
every
human
beings
right
to
be
treated
as
such
i
dont
expect
to
be
hired
based
on
my
sexual
orientation
if
someone
decides
he
wants
a
gayonly
staff
of
employees
thats
his
business
i
wont
force
him
to
hire
heterosexuals
please
dont
force
me
to
hire
homosexuals
therefore
we
should
be
oppressed
and
ignored
and
denigrated
right
i
you
arent
oppressed
in
california
but
its
ok
to
oppress
us
thats
what
youre
saying
no
im
saying
its
none
of
the
governments
business
what
two
consenting
adults
do
in
private
you
dont
believe
that
unfortunately
certainly
hope
you
dont
have
an
so
sir
because
if
she
heard
how
disparaging
you
are
towards
political
minorities
and
if
she
had
any
shred
of
selfrespect
shed
be
out
the
door
why
do
you
keep
insulting
women
and
blacks
by
comparing
them
to
homosexuals
this
sort
of
crap
makes
me
so
fucking
sick
that
i
cant
even
bring
myself
to
touch
it
youre
a
fuckwit
with
no
perspective
no
valid
life
experience
and
no
true
knowledge
of
the
human
condition
i
see
no
point
in
trying
to
convince
you
politely
that
were
not
all
like
the
ones
youve
met
because
youre
showing
no
willingness
at
all
to
be
openminded
enough
to
accept
that
your
stupid
generalizations
have
exceptions
you
are
an
intellectual
waste
and
the
reason
you
believe
the
worst
of
homosexuals
is
that
you
bring
out
the
worst
in
them
bi
andrew
d
simchik
schnopia
and
you
are
yet
another
reminder
of
the
emotional
instability
of
homosexuals
