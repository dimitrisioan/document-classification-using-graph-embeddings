isnt
it
wonderfull
the
way
people
can
make
the
sadistic
and
indescriminate
murder
of
the
badermeinhof
gang
sound
like
altruism
gee
phil
id
remember
where
you
are
and
that
these
people
are
monitoring
the
net
id
also
remember
that
they
have
about
as
much
sense
of
humor
as
ed
damn
it
isnt
big
brother
after
all
and
all
this
time
i
thought
that
all
those
revolutionaries
while
blowing
things
up
and
killing
the
odd
innocent
person
in
the
process
really
did
love
all
us
proles
cause
everybody
knows
that
dialectical
materialism
will
save
you
even
if
it
has
to
get
you
killed
first
what
a
fool
ive
been
what
you
fail
to
see
is
that
in
order
to
make
a
nightmarish
stew
of
psychosis
and
repression
you
have
to
break
a
few
eggs
you
the
evil
productive
elements
in
society
are
those
eggs
damn
the
spirit
full
speed
ahead
youre
like
a
bunch
of
overeducated
