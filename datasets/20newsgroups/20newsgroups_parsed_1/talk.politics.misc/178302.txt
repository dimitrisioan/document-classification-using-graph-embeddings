think
about
it
shouldnt
all
drugs
then
be
legalized
it
would
lower
the
cost
and
definitely
make
them
safer
to
use
yes
i
dont
think
we
want
to
start
using
these
criterion
to
determine
legality
why
not
where
do
they
get
these
people
i
really
dont
want
to
waste
time
in
here
to
do
battle
about
the
legalization
of
drugs
if
you
really
want
to
we
can
get
into
it
and
prove
just
how
idiotic
that
idea
is
you
asked
a
question
and
now
you
dont
want
people
to
answer
i
believe
a
legitimate
question
was
asked
why
shouldnt
cost
and
safety
be
used
at
least
in
part
to
determine
legality
id
like
to
see
you
prove
that
drug
legalization
is
an
idiotic
idea
seems
to
me
the
evidence
from
great
britain
is
pretty
convincing
that
drug
legalization
is
a
good
idea
even
such
a
noted
conservative
as
william
f
buckley
supports
it
my
point
was
that
it
is
pretty
stupid
to
justify
legalizing
something
just
because
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
a
few
more
ideas
to
hold
to
these
criterion
prostitution
the
killing
of
all
funny
farm
patients
aids
victims
elderly
unemployed
prisioners
etc
this
would
surely
make
my
taxes
decrease
your
examples
except
for
prostitution
fail
miserably
to
meet
both
criteria
safer
and
cheaper
obviously
killing
people
is
not
safe
as
for
prostitution
why
shouldnt
it
be
legal
dale
cook
any
town
having
more
churches
than
bars
has
a
serious
social
problem
