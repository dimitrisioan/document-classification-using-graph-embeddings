here
im
just
a
scientist
and
i
hate
to
see
statistics
abused
pity
you
didnt
say
something
about
the
use
of
statistics
to
justify
targeting
and
persecuting
a
minority
then
men
are
men
and
they
all
like
sex
i
am
a
gay
male
i
have
had
sex
three
times
in
my
life
all
with
the
same
man
before
that
i
was
a
virgin
i
am
a
hetero
man
and
have
had
sex
with
one
woman
in
my
life
my
wife
it
is
very
pleasing
to
me
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
hope
you
have
the
same
feeling
as
i
do
i
also
wish
that
you
could
if
you
wanted
experience
the
joys
and
trials
of
being
committed
to
someone
for
life
there
is
something
about
marriage
that
makes
the
commitment
much
greater
than
one
might
expect
what
in
the
tree
makes
you
think
we
queers
cant
experience
that
commitment
whats
stopping
us
from
committing
to
one
partner
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
i
have
every
intention
of
doing
so
once
i
find
the
right
personand
whether
that
person
is
male
or
female
i
seriously
doubt
that
a
church
ceremonypublic
vowlicence
will
make
any
difference
whatsoever
in
the
sort
of
commitment
i
experience
with
that
person
you
have
no
conception
of
the
difference
marriage
makes
since
you
have
never
known
any
other
way
statistics
alone
prove
that
most
criminals
are
by
default
hetero
dont
forget
about
the
culture
sadly
we
dont
as
a
society
look
upon
homosexuality
as
normal
and
as
we
are
all
too
well
aware
there
are
alot
of
people
who
condemn
it
as
a
result
the
gay
population
is
not
encouraged
to
develop
nonpromiscuous
relationships
in
fact
there
are
many
roadblocks
put
in
the
way
of
such
committed
relationships
it
is
as
if
the
heterosexual
community
puts
these
blocks
there
so
as
to
perpetuate
the
claim
that
gays
are
immoral
my
if
we
allowed
gays
to
marry
raise
children
we
might
just
find
out
theyre
as
moral
as
we
are
cant
have
that
can
we
youre
getting
to
the
right
idea
herejust
be
careful
of
making
statements
like
the
above
and
youll
be
part
of
the
solution
and
not
the
problem
just
some
thoughts
flame
away
