teel
writes
well
the
two
nifty
letters
giving
concrete
proof
that
the
income
tax
is
voluntary
and
giving
specific
procedures
for
stopping
withholding
et
cetera
have
been
out
there
for
a
while
now
there
has
been
no
refutation
to
date
have
the
naysayers
finally
given
up
as
defeated
sure
would
like
to
hear
there
reasons
for
disbelief
at
this
point
probably
because
you
have
yet
to
respond
to
the
refutation
ive
posted
teel
its
bad
enough
you
post
this
bs
its
even
worse
that
you
dont
even
try
to
defend
it
when
it
gets
torn
to
pieces
but
then
posting
that
no
ones
looked
at
it
and
gloating
when
all
facts
point
to
the
contrary
point
to
a
severely
deluded
mind
what
i
found
interesting
about
conklins
letter
is
the
cases
he
has
won
against
the
irs
now
assuming
that
these
cases
really
exist
and
were
one
by
him
anyone
checked
they
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
major
tax
claim
the
irs
fought
one
of
his
deductions
defending
your
deductions
seems
puny
when
you
believe
that
there
is
no
need
to
file
in
the
