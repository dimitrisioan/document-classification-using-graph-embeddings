unfortunately
homosexuals
dont
believe
in
this
concept
of
freedom
they
believe
that
they
have
a
right
to
force
people
to
hire
them
rent
to
them
and
do
business
with
them
regardless
of
the
feelings
or
beliefs
of
the
other
person
allow
me
to
point
out
that
clayton
is
once
again
unfairly
lumping
an
entire
class
of
people
as
if
they
all
have
one
will
having
completely
dived
into
the
abyss
of
believing
that
there
are
no
queers
in
the
world
who
think
differently
from
the
childmolestationadvocating
minority
on
socmotss
he
doesnt
even
notice
that
hes
starting
a
sentence
with
they
believe
when
the
referent
of
that
they
is
millions
of
people
so
few
as
to
be
irrelevant
if
you
dont
want
to
be
lumped
together
as
a
group
stop
insisting
on
being
treated
as
a
member
of
a
group

writes
you
give
them
a
fair
look
you
decide
that
you
dont
want
to
hire
the
guy
wearing
the
nambla
tshirt
he
files
a
lawsuit
you
lose
yes
such
laws
force
you
to
hire
homosexuals
pedophiles
as
well
sexual
orientation
is
not
defined
by
the
antidiscrimination
law
that
was
passed
last
year
pedophilia
isnt
a
sexual
orientation
and
cramer
let
me
describe
how
youd
have
it
and
see
if
this
is
accurate
i
apply
for
a
job
at
a
computer
company
they
see
im
wearing
some
article
of
homosexual
adornment
i
dunno
maybe
a
silence
death
pin
or
something
they
turn
me
down
because
of
that
i
cant
do
a
darned
thing
and
have
to
go
look
somewhere
else
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
you
wholeheartedly
approve
of
the
companys
actions
or
at
least
that
you
wholeheartedly
support
their
right
to
take
that
action
i
wholeheartedly
support
their
right
to
take
this
action
i
wouldnt
do
it
myself
unless
it
was
something
like
the
nambla
tshirt
how
about
a
black
man
applies
for
a
job
at
a
bank
the
bank
decides
based
on
statistics
a
black
person
would
be
more
likely
to
steal
money
and
denies
the
man
the
job
would
you
support
the
banks
right
to
this
freedom
if
not
explain
how
this
differs
i
support
their
right
to
do
so
just
like
i
support
your
right
to
engage
in
sodomy
with
consenting
adults
but
i
think
they
are
doing
something
wrong
i
wouldnt
do
business
with
such
a
bank
clayton
has
repeatedly
said
that
californias
statutes
classify
pedophilia
as
a
sexual
orientation
and
that
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation
is
illegal
if
true
im
frankly
amazed
but
i
dont
trust
clayton
to
give
me
the
whole
story
would
someone
clarify
for
me
whether
this
is
true
what
sort
of
discrimination
claytons
talking
about
jobs
housing
hate
crimes
and
whether
the
effect
of
the
law
is
really
that
a
daycare
has
to
hire
an
admitted
pedophile
