were

on
drugs
not
the
dea
and
other
organizations
would
have
the
american
people
believe
that
we
are
winning
the
war
on
drugs
im
going
to
dispel
the
propaganda
that
the
dea
is
putting
out
by
showing
you
the
drug
wars
real
status
to
help
prove
my
assertions
ive
also
posted
two
articles
from
usa
today
that
clearly
demonstrate
that
drug
use
among
certain
age
groups
is
on
the
rise
if
wod
is
working
as
were
led
to
believe
then
drug
abuse
should
have
gone
down
substantially
by
now
the
reality
is
is
that
it
has
not
gone
down
very
much
if
anything
substance
abuse
is
on
the
rise
im
also
going
to
supply
a
possible
solution
to
this
problem
the
following
text
is
an
excerpt
from
an
article
about
rock
music
and
pot
entitled
hello
again
mary
jane
which
appears
in
the
current
issue
of
time
magazine
april
p
lawenforcement
officials
say
pot
advocates
are
just
blowing
smoke
when
they
talk
about
the
comeback
of
the
weed
perhaps
because
of
the
change
of
administrations
the
marijuana
lobby
is
out
in
full
force
says
robert
bonner
head
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
the
fact
is
theyre
losing
the
battle
in
more
than
of
youths
ages
to
said
they
smoked
marijuana
in
that
figure
was
and
bonner
says
it
is
still
falling
bonner
also
offers
a
reminder
that
studies
confirm
such
marijuana
health
risks
as
destruction
of
nerve
cells
in
the
brain
and
lung
damage

report
we
are
not
winning
the
war
on
drugs
i
think
you
can
see
that
one
of
the
tactics
that
the
dea
employs
to
give
people
the
impression
that
the
war
on
drugs
is
being
won
is
to
selectively
quote
statistics
only
statistics
that
support
their
contention
that
drug
use
has
gone
down
the
excerpt
from
time
magazine
that
i
included
in
this
post
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
organizations
like
the
dea
attempt
to
deceive
the
public
usage
of
one
particular
drug
may
have
gone
down
but
at
the
same
time
usage
of
other
drugs
may
have
gone
up
aka
substitution
also
drug
usage
among
one
particular
age
group
may
have
gone
down
but
drug
usage
among
another
age
group
may
have
gone
up
therefore
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
big
picture
taking
into
consideration
all
the
statistics
then
its
obvious
that
the
socalled
war
on
drugs
is
being
lost
perhaps
the
drug
war
is
being
won
as
far
as
illegal
drugs
go
but
if
one
factors
in
alcohol
abuse
smoking
and
use
of
inhalants
then
the
magnitude
of
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
can
then
placed
in
its
true
perspective
for
those
of
you
who
dont
consider
alcohol
to
be
a
drug
then
try
drinking
a
fifth
of
whiskey
sometime
and
then
come
back
and
tell
me
that
its
not
a
drug
agencies
like
the
dea
only
go
after
illegal
drugs
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
drug
war
is
a
fruitless
attempt
at
preventing
substance
abusepeople
will
merely
switch
to
another
drug
if
the
one
they
were
using
becomes
scarce
or
unpopular
the
solution
to
the
drug
abuse
problem
in
this
country
may
be
to
legalize
somenot
alldrugs
whose
toxicity
has
been
shown
to
be
within
reasonable
limits
you
wont
drop
dead
after
using
it
a
few
times
and
then
couple
this
with
a
massive
drug
education
program
the
reason
why
i
think
legalization
is
part
of
the
solution
is
because
people
seem
to
be
able
to
easily
obtain
drugs
despite
the
governments
efforts
to
the
contrarythe
money
spent
on
drug
interdiction
could
be
spent
more
effectively
elsewhere
eg
drug
education
additionally
legalization
would
reduce
crime
because
the
profit
motive
would
be
taken
out
of
drug
trafficking
which
often
goes
along
with
other
kinds
of
crime
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
addicts
would
have
less
reason
to
prey
on
innocent
people
for
their
money
and
posessions
in
order
to
support
their
expensive
habit
legalization
would
cause
the
street
price
of
drugs
to
fall
substantially
so
drugs
would
be
much
more
affordable
to
addicts
imho
the
way
to
reduce
substance
abuse
is
to
do
to
drugs
what
has
been
done
to
smokers
make
drug
use
socially
unacceptable
rather
than
try
to
employ
heavyhanded
law
enforcement
and
punish
people
by
incarcerating
them
as
you
already
know
people
in
the
us
smoke
a
lot
less
than
they
used
to
this
reduction
in
the
number
of
smokers
has
been
brought
about
by
public
awareness
campaigns
laws
restricting
where
people
can
light
up
warning
labels
on
cigarette
packages
taxation
on
tobacco
in
order
to
reduce
consumption
and
so
on
i
propose
that
similar
methods
be
used
to
reduce
substance
abuse
after
legalization
has
been
carried
out
they
are
as
follows
drugs
being
sold
must
come
with
clear
concise
information
which
states
the
possible
health
hazzards
involved
with
using
this
product
and
recommendations
on
how
the
drug
should
be
used
things
like
dosage
levels
and
how
long
the
drug
should
be
used
ought
to
accompany
the
packaging
the
drug
is
contained
in
all
drugs
should
be
taxed
at
a
rate
that
generates
a
lot
of
revenue
but
not
so
high
as
to
encourage
people
to
acquire
drugs
through
illegal
channels
part
of
the
revenue
collected
from
drug
taxes
should
be
used
to
fund
drug
education
and
law
enforcement
make
it
a
felony
to
sell
drugs
to
minors
people
under
the
age
of
anyone
can
sell
drugs
but
they
must
not
dodge
paying
the
taxes
on
drugs
or
sell
drugs
with
the
warning
information
absent
failure
to
pay
the
appropiate
taxes
on
drugs
or
omitting
warning
information
should
also
be
a
felony
establish
a
government
agency
whose
job
is
to
insure
that
the
purity
and
safety
of
all
drugs
is
as
high
as
possible
this
agency
would
try
to
prevent
people
from
getting
a
hold
of
bad
drugssomething
that
is
a
fairly
serious
problem
now
im
sure
that
many
of
the
things
ive
discussed
in
this
article
have
been
hashed
out
before
in
this
newsgroup
nevertheless
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
give
my
two
cents
actually
a
buck
and
a
half
all
at
once
so
you
could
get
a
good
idea
of
where
i
currently
stand
on
wod
go
ahead
and
tear
into
my
post
im
sure
there
is
something
in
it
that
you
may
wish
to
take
a
different
view
on
or
flame
btw
i
posted
the
articles
from
usa
today
to
not
only
help
prove
my
assertions
but
also
to
provide
information
on
lsd
usage
among
youths
something
which
i
noticed
some
posters
to
this
group
were
interested
in
scott
