some
chump
at
brandeis
i
mean
how
many
people
actually
care
how
many
people
are
gay
as
long
as
you
know
how
to
findavoid
them
if
you
want
to
i
dont
if
you
dont
care
why
was
so
much
effort
put
into
promoting
the
lie
because
it
was
important
to
scare
politicians
into
obedience
i
wouldnt
worry
too
much
about
it
though
we
are
starting
to
find
out
how
politically
impotent
homosexuals
really
are
the
colorado
boycott
has
fizzled
slick
willie
was
effectively
prevented
from
implementing
his
military
policy
wrt
homosexuals
by
members
of
his
own
party
this
new
study
casts
a
large
shadow
of
doubt
on
their
claims
of
large
numbers
and
coming
this
saturday
they
are
going
to
wind
up
with
tremendous
egg
on
their
face
when
i
submit
no
more
than
perhaps
queers
will
show
up
in
washington
while
they
are
promising
crowds
in
the
millions
and
most
of
the
ones
who
will
be
there
will
look
like
actup
and
queer
nation
not
the
guy
working
in
the
next
cubicle
as
if
thats
really
going
to
play
in
middle
america
pretty
soon
they
will
find
themselves
retreating
back
into
the
closet
where
they
belong
the
views
expressed
herein
are
theodore
a
kaldis
my
own
only
do
you
seriously
believe
that
a
major
university
rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
as
this
would
hold
such
views
