details
that
you
are
seeking
is
that
the
grahmrudman
budget
controls
were
working
in
fact
they
were
working
so
well
that
unless
the
feds
did
something
they
were
going
to
have
to
start
cutting
pork
so
bush
and
the
democrats
got
together
in
a
budget
summit
and
replaced
grahmrudman
with
the
now
historic
grand
compromise
in
which
bush
yea
it
turned
out
that
grammrudman
was
a
sham
to
fool
the
voters
into
accepting
the
borrowandspend
policies
of
the
last
years
as
it
turned

the

killed

anyone
can
expand
the
economy
by
chargeing
trillion
on
their
credit
cards
big

deficit
spending
only
expands
the
economy
in
the
short
term
in
the
long
term
it
shrinks
the
economy
for
numerous
reasons
i
would
have
much
preferred
that
the
taxpayers
had
that
trillion
instead
the
result
is
that
clinton
now
hopes
to
reduce
the
deficit
to
a
level
above
where
it
was
when
reagan
left
office
chew

if
reagan
had
kept
his
campaign
promise
to
balance
the
budget
by
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
bush
or
clinton
to
raise
taxes
and
all
reagan
had
to
do
was
balance
that
puny
carter
deficit
