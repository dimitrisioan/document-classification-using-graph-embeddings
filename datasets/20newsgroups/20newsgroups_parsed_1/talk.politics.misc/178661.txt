re
top
ten
comments
overheard
in
the
secret
service
lounge
in
article
carl
aron
writes
and
the
word
liberal
definitely
has
a
different
connotation
than
what
you
have
written
above
just
ask
michael
dukakis
yeah
the
republicans
have
defined
it
to
mean
spends
money
on
things
that
dont
make
our
rich
buddies
richer
if
you
have
something
reasoned
and
intelligent
to
say
then
you
should
post
if
all
you
can
do
is
rant
and
rave
save
it
or
maybe
they
mean
that
liberals
believe
in
tax
and
spend
rather
than
borrow
and
spend
true
conservatism
is
cutting
spending
and
taxes
its
a
matter
of
debate
just
how
succesful
the
last
few
presidents
have
been
at
that
finally
it
means
openminded
about
things
that
i
dont
want
to
be
open
minded
about
i
hear
it
again
and
again
and
ive
noticed
far
more
often
from
liberals
than
anyone
else
if
you
dont
agree
with
me
you
are
closeminded
look
whos
talking
i
suggest
you
take
a
look
at
your
post
i
see
nothing
but
unfair
and
unsubstantiated
generalizations
it
suggests
that
the
author
is
anything
but
openminded
next
time
you
feel
like
posting
something
like
this
save
it
for
somebody
who
cares
