sorry
reading
this
newsgroup
i
cant
help
but
get
the
impression
of
frothing
at

mouth
lunatics
i
get
a
lot
of
snip
c
constitution
worshiping
its
right
because
its
in
the
constitution
as
if
the
constitution
wasnt
framed
by
men
centuries
ago
in
a
totally
different
world
we
have
three
options
with
respect
to
the
constitution
abide
by
it
duly
amend
it
abandon
those
parts
of
which
a
majority
disapproves
of
course
since
the
whole
point
of
the
constitution
is
to
restrain
the
will
of
the
majority
and
since
even
in
unfettered
democracy
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
minorities
amounts
to
abandoning
the
constitution
altogether
which
will
it
be
mark

any
resemblance
between
my

purely
coincidental
