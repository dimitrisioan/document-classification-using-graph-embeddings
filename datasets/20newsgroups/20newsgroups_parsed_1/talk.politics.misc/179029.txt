in
article
writes
here
are
several
shreds
of
evidence
that
prove
the
waco
disaster
is
the
governments
fault
they
raided
an
americans
property
because
of
rumors
about
koreshs
intentions
with
some
converted
yet
still
ndamendment
protected
firearms
a
judgeapproved
warrant
justifies
nothing
in
a
democracy
under
the
rule
of
law
a
search
warrant
justifies
a
search
the
us
constitution
does
not
justify
murder
of
those
attempting
to
mount
a
search
for
illegally
held
weapons
a
search
for
illegally
held
weapons
if
there
were
any
no
evidence
yet
produced
to
this
effect
does
not
justify
firing
into
a
house
with
women
and
children
either
it
also
does
not
justify
shooting
first
without
identifying
oneself
the
atf
and
fbi
have
done
this
before
so
dont
say
they
havent
please
or
producing
a
warrant
guess
it
depends
on
whose
story
one
believes
huh
it
took
them
days
to
think
of
a
basic
terrorist
tactic
ie
tear
gas
and
this
could
only
be
justified
in
support
of
rescuing
any
supposed
hostages
inside
the
govt
has
a
right
to
use
lethal
force
in
certain
cases
attempts
to
capture
dangerous
criminals
who
are
armed
and
threatening
the
lives
of
others
which
others
are
we
talking
about
here
is
one
in
this
case
they
used
sub
lethal
force
sub
lethal
excuse
me
but
those
people
are
dead
the
govt
immediately
imprisoned
these
socalled
hostages
the
children
were
held
hostage
evidence
so
far
the
fbi
has
produced
none
dont
hold
your
breath
the
adults
were
wanted
variously
for
murder
and
conspiracy
to
murder
only
a
few
of
those
being
held
in
chains
and
shackles
are
wanted
the
rest
are
being
held
for
the
crime
of
being
material
witnesses
it
took
hundreds
of
govt
agents
with
taxfunded
cellular
phones
ten
minutes
to
dial
for
the
fire
department
they
should
not
have
called
the
fire
dept
at
all
there
was
no
role
for
them
to
play
in
a
situation
where
those
that
might
be
rescued
might
well
shoot
at
them
it
was
not
the
feds
decision
to
make
but
the
firefighters
calling
the
fire
dept
meant
that
waco
was
deprived
of
a
resource
that
might
have
been
needed
elsewhere
should
a
situation
where
it
could
have
been
used
arisen
this
is
true
of
any
answer
to
a
call
for
help
from
a
fire
department
by
any
citizen
since
fire
departments
do
answer
calls
that
deprive
resources
that
might
be
needed
elsewhere
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
for
not
calling
them
further
since
the
davidians
had
not
been
found
guilty
of
any
crime
in
a
court
of
law
they
are
subject
to
the
same
protection
as
any
other
citizen
and
las
far
as
i
know
even
criminals
in
prison
are
not
left
to
burn
to
death
in
a
fire
by
cutting
off
the
water
supply
in
the
surrounding
area
the
govt
guaranteed
that
any
fire
at
the
compound
would
be
fatal
any
fire
started
deliberately
uising
lamp
oil
is
likely
to
be
fatal
i
guess
this
is
a
matter
of
religious
faith
with
you
the
government
says
it
so
it
must
be
so
or
havent
you
been
reading
this
thread
well
enough
to
notice
that
some
of
us
here
dont
beleive
their
story
no
one
had
the
foresight
to
station
rescue
vehicles
nearby
in
the
first
place
they
are
a
scarce
resource
a
bunch
of
psychos
can
not
deprive
the
neighbourhood
of
a
resource
that
might
be
required
in
a
genuine
case
patients
in
psychiatric
hospitals
are
not
left
to
die
in
fires
either
besides
as
i
explained
some
of
us
here
believe
their
distress
might
have
been
genuine
are
you
so
certain
it
wasnt
the
govt
conveniently
forgot
all
that
freedom
of
religion
stuff
freedom
of
religion
does
not
include
human
sacrifice
nor
does
it
include
other
forms
of
murder
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
davidians
committed
human
sacrifice
either
before
of
after
the
initial
raid
and
selfdefense
is
not
murder
the
govt
arguably
started
or
at
least
fanned
the
fire
themselves
the
govt
arguably
is
run
by
communists
or
the
trilateral
commission
he
did
not
say
it
was
deliberate
accidents
do
not
require
conspiracy
theories
only
wanton
disregard
for
human
life
the
initial
raid
alone
agents
firing
blind
into
walls
against
all
standards
of
law
enforce
ment
procedure
proves
they
did
not
mind
killing
people
finally
and
this
may
be
a
stretch
for
some
of
you
statists
out
there
but
koreshs
original
reasons
for
holing
up
in
such
a
compound
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
continual
interference
from
the
govt
new
taxes
new
regulations
and
increasing
involvement
in
every
aspect
of
our
personal
and
economic
lives
life
on
a
compound
might
become
the
way
of
the
future
it
might
have
to
be
let
us
hope
that
those
who
support
koresh
are
not
allowed
to
enforce
this
upon
the
rest
of
us
no
one
here
is
supporting
koresh
we
are
opposing
the
illegal
use
of
excessive
violence
by
our
government
against
our
citizens
that
is
all
their
reasons
for
supporting
the
ownership
of
high
power
weaponry
are
clear
enough
they
hope
that
this
will
be
the
catylist
for
the
destruction
of
the
fabric
of
society
and
allow
them
to
enforce
their
nightmare
vision
of
the
future
a
society
that
believes
it
is
ok
to
terrorize
people
for
their
religious
views
will
destroy
itself
in
due
time
it
is
the
feds
who
disrupted
the
fabric
of
society
in
waco
not
koresh
it
is
the
feds
who
forced
a
nightmare
onto
the
people
of
mount
carmel
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
people
to
study
history
on
what
basis
do
you
assume
we
havent
dont
you
really
mean
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
people
drew
the
same
conclusions
from
history
that
i
do
in
particular
a
group
of
militant
militant
implies
acts
of
aggression
against
ones
neighbors
the
davidians
left
their
neighbors
alone
religious
heretics
who
left
to
set
up
such
a
community
some
time
ago
a
few
years
latter
they
had
captured
medina
and
destroyed
the
idols
in
the
kabba
within
ten
years
the
whole
of
arabia
was
under
islam
so
what
the
mormons
were
considered
a
cult
for
years
and
were
chased
out
of
one
place
after
another
on
much
the
same
thinking
as
you
are
advocating
when
they
finally
got
to
set
up
a
community
they
left
people
alone
so
far
americans
havent
been
put
to
the
sword
by
mormon
hordes
crying
to
avenge
joseph
smith
just
because
a
group
of
people
start
by
saying
that
all
they
want
is
to
be
left
alone
does
not
mean
that
that
is
how
they
will
stay
it
doesnt
mean
they
wont
either
anyway
the
whole
purpose
of
a
system
of
laws
is
to
punish
people
for
what
they
do
not
what
they
might
do
the
pat
robertsons
oral
roberts
and
jimmy
swaggarts
of
this
world
are
quite
telling
other
people
how
to
run
their
lives
telling
is
not
the
same
as
forcing
when
the
police
knock
at
my
door
i
can
not
make
them
go
away
by
changing
the
channei
as
for
pat
and
friends
i
dont
even
watch
their
channel
since
i
am
an
atheist
so
far
not
watching
them
tell
me
what
to
do
hasnt
gotten
me
killed
if
you
allow
such
people
to
get
guns
and
point
them
in
your
face
you
are
likely
to
find
that
they
are
running
your
life
right
now
the
only
people
sticking
guns
in
anyones
faces
is
the
government
and
they
are
trying
very
hard
to
run
my
life
or
havent
you
noticed
