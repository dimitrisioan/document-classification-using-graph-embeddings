the
clinton
administration
wants
to
manage
your
use
of
digital
encryption
this
includes
a
proposal
which
would
limit
your
use
of
encryption
to
a
standard
developed
by
the
nsa
the
technical
details
of
which
would
remain
classified
with
the
government
this
can
not
be
allowed
to
happen
it
is
a
bit
unfair
to
call
blame
the
clinton
administration
alonethis
initiative
was
underway
under
the
bush
administrationit
is
basically
a
bipartisan
effort
of
the
establishment
demopublicans
and
republicratsthe
same
bipartisan
effort
that
brought
the
