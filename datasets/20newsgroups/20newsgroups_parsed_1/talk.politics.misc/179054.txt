the

office
of
the

secretary
for
immediate
release
april
press
briefing
by
dee
dee
myers
the
briefing
room
am
edt
ms
myers
at
pm
were
having
a
press
conference
bill
in
the
east
room
and
then
saturday
the
president
will
leave
here
at
roughly
am
and
fly
down
to
jamestown
he
will
spend
the
day
there
overnight
at
camp
david
on
sunday
its
unclear
exactly
what
time
hell
leave
camp
david
and
fly
to
boston
hell
leave
from
hagerstown
the
press
plane
will
leave
from
washington
he
will
meet
with
some
q
what
kind
of
a
plane
is
that
hes
taking
ms
myers
that
hes
taking
hell
probably
take
a
c
q
from
hagerstown
ms
myers
from
hagerstown
air
force
one
doesnt
fly
out
of
hagerstown
apparently
q
how
will
the
pool
travel
ms
myers
the
pool
will
have
to
meet
him
ahead
of
time
so
i
guess
the
pool
will
travel
with
the
press
plane
and
wait
for
him
at
the
airport
there
is
currently
no
provision
and
ill
doublecheck
because
theres
currently
no
provision
i
think
thats
standard
operating
practice
q
the
pool
is
not
going
to
meet
him
and
watch
him
get
on
the
plane
at
hagerstown
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
q
what
time
does
he
have
to
be
in
boston
ms
myers
hes
going
to
meet
there
with
a
group
of
citizens
mostly
people
who
supported
us
during
the
campaign
at
around
pm
were
still
working
out
the
final
times
q
at
the
airport
ms
myers
no
it
will
be
at
the
boston
harbor
hotel
and
then
he
will
also
meet
with
some
a
youth
group
that
authored
something
called
project
the
speech
to
the
publishers
is
actually
at
pm
it
will
be
followed
by
qa
and
then
after
the
speech
and
qa
hell
attend
a
reception
with
the
publishers
and
then
return
to
washington
from
boston
and
thats
it
for
the
weekend
q
has
the
president
seen
the
report
from
or
the
letter
communication
from
the
foreign
service
officers
also
obviously
the
communication
from
madeleine
albright
and
what
is
his
reaction
to
their
call
on
him
ms
myers
well
obviously
the
letter
was
written
to
secretary
christopher
i
believe
secretary
christopher
received
the
letter
on
saturday
he
reviewed
it
and
met
with
the
authors
on
monday
to
discuss
their
views
he
believes
its
an
important
part
of
the
policymaking
process
and
is
taking
their
views
into
account
as
we
go
forward
in
the
development
of
the
bosnia
policy
q
what
is
the
presidents
reaction
ms
myers
the
president
hasnt
seen
the
letter
it
was
something
that
was
directed
towards
secretary
christopher
in
terms
of
he
hasnt
seen
specifically
the
letter
but
in
terms
of
their
concerns
generally
what
the
president
has
said
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
options
on
the
table
now
including
ones
that
werent
there
before
and
i
think
hes
as
is
everybody
gravely
concerned
about
the
situation
in
bosnia
q
is
he
influenced
by
that
i
mean
how
does
he
feel
about
the
fact
that
all
of
the
specialists
in
that
area
those
desk
officers
ms
myers
many
of
the
specialists
in
that
area
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
part
of
the
process
its
something
their
views
will
clearly
be
considered
i
think
secretary
christopher
met
with
the
group
immediately
to
discuss
their
views
i
think
he
believes
that
there
ought
to
be
room
for
opinions
and
that
those
opinions
ought
to
be
considered
particularly
from
people
who
work
closely
on
the
issues
q
what
do
you
mean
there
are
options
on
the
table
that
werent
there
before
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
said
last
week
that
there
were
options
such
as
lifting
the
arms
embargo
to
the
bosnian
muslims
that
had
been
previously
off
the
table
that
are
now
being
considered
q
dee
dee
in
terms
of
those
options
madeleine
albright
is
saying
that
potentially
there
could
be
unilateral
action
by
the
us
if
the
europeans
did
not
go
along
is
that
on
the
table
ms
myers
well
i
cant
discuss
anything
that
would
any
conversations
that
would
have
happened
between
ambassador
albright
and
the
president
but
i
think
the
president
has
said
he
would
certainly
is
working
with
our
european
allies
hes
had
a
number
of
conversations
with
european
leaders
and
is
trying
to
build
some
consensus
there
q
will
he
reach
a
decision
will
he
have
anything
specific
to
say
today
ms
myers
no
i
mean
in
term
of
there
will
be
no
new
announcement
of
policy
today
q
does
your
statement
mean
he
has
ruled
out
unilateral
action
ms
myers
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
at
this
point
he
has
said
i
think
hes
been
fairly
clear
about
it
that
the
he
believes
that
the
us
needs
to
act
in
concert
with
its
allies
on
this
q
on
that
point
does
he
believe
that
the
us
though
does
have
builtin
authority
from
the
united
nations
already
to
take
unilateral
action
ms
myers
well
i
think
the
un
resolution
makes
it
clear
that
you
can
act
unilaterally
in
support
of
any
humanitarian
relief
effort
i
think
the
broader
point
is
that
anything
we
do
any
options
that
we
decide
to
pursue
we
will
make
sure
that
it
is
consistent
with
un
authority
and
if
its
not
well
work
with
our
allies
to
make
sure
that
we
get
it
q
dee
dee
then
how
does
the
white
house
someone
as
distinguished
as
elie
wiesel
who
says
that
not
enough
is
being
done
to
stop
the
atrocities
going
on
in
bosnia
ms
myers
i
think
that
thats
why
were
considering
additional
options
i
think
that
mr
wiesels
comments
yesterday
were
quite
compelling
the
situation
in
bosnia
is
tragic
the
president
is
very
concerned
about
it
he
has
i
think
president
clinton
has
worked
very
hard
to
take
further
actions
to
continue
to
isolate
serbia
in
the
world
community
clearly
were
considering
other
options
because
the
president
is
concerned
that
perhaps
its
not
enough
q
in
terms
of
what
you
were
just
talking
about
it
sounds
like
resolution
justifies
unilateral
action
by
the
us
to
protect
humanitarian
ms
myers
i
dont
think
it
i
wouldnt
use
the
word
justify
it
permits
unilateral
action
by
any
country
in
protecting
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
relief
but
i
think
thats
just
an
explanation
of
the
resolution
i
think
any
action
that
we
take
will
be
consistent
with
un
resolutions
or
well
work
with
our
allies
to
make
sure
that
it
is
permissible
or
well
get
further
action
q
the
president
and
other
officials
have
ruled
out
unilateral
us
action
in
bosnia
in
the
past
youre
declining
to
do
that
this
morning
ms
myers
no
i
said
the
president
has
said
repeatedly
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
our
allies
on
this
q
that
doesnt
mean
that
he
wont
act
alone
which
has
been
said
before
explicitly
ms
myers
i
dont
mean
to
imply
a
change
in
policy
the
president
has
said
all
along
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
our
allies
on
this
q
one
other
little
question
did
he
know
about
this
letter
from
the
foreign
service
officers
before
it
hit
the
papers
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
secretary
christopher
they
may
have
had
a
private
conversation
about
it
the
president
has
not
seen
it
q
they
met
on
monday
right
christopher
met
surely
he
must
have
brought
that
up
ms
myers
again
they
may
have
talked
privately
about
it
but
q
dee
dee
what
youre
saying
is
that
the
albright
recommendation
has
been
rejected
is
that
correct
ms
myers
no
i
didnt
say
that
at
all
i
said
i
wont
i
said
i
wouldnt
comment
on
any
conversations
or
communications
q
shes
advocating
unilateral
action
and
youre
saying
in
effect
that
we
will
not
take
unilateral
action
ms
myers
i
am
not
confirming
anything
that
madeleine
albright
may
or
may
not
have
recommended
q
given
the
sometimes
delicate
complicated
and
frustrating
nature
of
negotiations
with
the
allies
on
this
issue
does
the
president
find
this
kind
of
letter
from
foreign
service
officers
of
the
state
department
helpful
to
that
process
hurtful
to
that
ms
myers
i
think
that
their
views
are
obviously
being
considered
the
secretary
received
that
memo
on
saturday
and
two
days
later
he
met
with
them
in
order
to
have
a
more
thorough
airing
of
their
views
of
the
basis
for
their
views
to
discuss
in
greater
detail
the
options
that
they
had
presented
in
the
letter
q
doesnt
it
put
some
kind
of
pressure
on
additional
pressure
on
him
now
from
within
his
own
administration
to
act
regardless
of
what
the
allies
may
or
may
not
do
ms
myers
i
think
clearly
theres
a
broad
policy
review
underway
now
and
the
president
and
his
advisors
are
considering
a
number
of
options
including
some
of
those
outlined
in
the
letter
from
the
folks
over
at
the
state
department
now
no
decisions
have
been
made
on
that
yet
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
through
review
underway
and
that
their
opinions
are
being
very
seriously
considered
q
if
i
can
just
follow
up
i
guess
what
im
looking
for
is
what
was
his
reaction
to
this
letter
did
he
say
good
this
bolsters
my
position
or
did
he
say
damn
this
is
just
what
i
dont
need
right
now
ms
myers
i
think
he
said
this
helps
contribute
substantively
to
the
debate
its
important
that
all
views
be
considered
and
aired
thoroughly
that
before
he
makes
a
decision
he
wants
to
have
the
best
possible
advice
and
information
possible
and
this
i
think
in
many
ways
furthers
that
goal
q
so
internal
advice
to
a
cabinet
official
or
the
president
its
all
open
now
and
you
wouldnt
take
any
umbrage
or
say
that
they
were
out
of
line
ms
myers
i
think
that
the
fact
that
secretary
christopher
met
with
them
to
discuss
their
views
and
make
sure
they
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
more
complete
conversation
about
it
is
conclusive
evidence
that
their
views
are
welcome
q
does
the
policy
review
include
what
madeleine
albright
has
suggested
and
what
joe
biden
and
others
have
suggested
which
is
that
the
previous
un
resolutions
authorize
unilateral
action
military
action
for
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
ms
myers
i
think
all
options
are
on
the
table
q
the
unilateral
option
is
on
the
table
ms
myers
i
think
all
options
are
on
the
table
q
weve
had
two
different
q
isnt
that
a
change
dee
dee
q
that
would
be
a
change
of
policy
q
particularly
if
it
includes
ground
troops
which
has
been
specifically
ruled
out
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
has
been
well
no
i
dont
that
is
not
q
are
you
talking
about
all
options
ms
myers
all
options
i
think
the
president
has
been
fairly
clear
about
that
so
let
me
just
review
again
what
he
has
said
he
has
said
that
the
president
has
said
all
options
are
on
the
table
with
the
exception
of
the
introduction
of
ground
troops
which
he
has
never
suggested
he
has
ruled
that
out
from
the
beginning
q
hasnt
he
ruled
out
unilateral
action
of
any
sort
ms
myers
he
has
said
that
he
doesnt
believe
the
us
can
solve
the
problems
in
the
former
yugoslavia
by
itself
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
very
complicated
options
on
the
table
right
now
i
dont
think
that
again
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
specific
options
that
are
being
considered
other
than
in
the
broad
categories
that
weve
already
said
things
like
lifting
the
arms
embargo
against
the
bosnian
muslims
things
that
i
think
weve
talked
about
in
broad
terms
this
is
a
very
complicated
situation
the
options
being
presented
and
considered
are
very
complicated
q
air
strikes
on
the
table
ms
myers
again
i
think
thats
been
fairly
clearly
pointed
out
that
thats
something
thats
being
discussed
q
dee
dee
are
ground
troops
on
the
ms
myers
no
ground
troops
are
not
being
considered
q
you
said
there
was
not
going
to
be
you
said
you
were
not
announcing
a
change
of
policy
then
you
said
everything
is
on
the
table
were
confused
are
unilateral
actions
on
the
table
ms
myers
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
the
president
has
said
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
the
allies
on
this
q
wants
to
but
hes
willing
to
i
mean
if
they
dont
go
along
ms
myers
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
on
this
hes
continuing
to
have
discussions
hes
continuing
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
thats
clear
the
conversation
is
ongoing
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
them
to
find
the
best
possible
solution
and
next
step
on
this
q
dee
dee
the
allies
have
taken
the
position
that
to
conduct
any
kind
of
air
strikes
in
bosnia
would
have
the
opposite
effect
of
ensuring
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
that
they
feel
that
their
troops
on
the
ground
monitoring
the
delivery
of
that
aid
would
become
vulnerable
and
the
bosnians
ms
myers
im
not
sure
thats
the
consistent
i
mean
im
not
sure
who
youre
referring
to
q
the
british
and
the
french
q
yes
the
british
and
french
theyve
taken
the
position
that
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
would
be
jeopardized
by
any
kind
of
air
strikes
against
the
bosnian
military
does
the
us
believe
differently
from
that
ms
myers
the
president
has
had
conversations
with
both
mitterrand
and
major
as
you
know
i
think
that
there
is
a
thorough
review
of
policy
going
on
in
those
countries
as
well
and
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
the
nature
of
the
presidents
discussions
other
than
to
say
that
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
as
we
move
forward
and
hes
continuing
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
that
process
is
ongoing
q
the
other
day
voted
against
any
military
intervention
yesterday
does
the
president
regard
that
as
the
end
of
the
line
or
does
he
does
still
hold
out
some
possibility
of
unilateral
action
the
allies
have
been
very
very
plain
that
they
do
not
want
to
do
anything
ms
myers
the
consultations
are
ongoing
thats
all
i
can
tell
you
at
this
point
q
are
you
saying
that
there
wont
be
any
announcement
on
bosnia
today
in
the
press
conference
ms
myers
no
that
is
not
the
intention
of
the
press
conference
q
what
is
the
intention
ms
myers
its
an
opportunity
to
take
questions
he
may
have
a
brief
im
sure
hell
have
a
brief
opening
statement
but
it
is
not
an
opportunity
to
outline
a
new
policy
on
bosnia
that
will
not
happen
q
can
you
tell
us
what
the
subject
of
the
opening
statement
is
ms
myers
its
sort
of
a
general
statement
of
where
we
are
q
after
the
first
hundred
days
you
mean
ms
myers
its
not
a
long
statement
i
mean
this
is
just
generally
dont
look
for
any
major
policy
pronouncements
q
do
you
know
what
the
opening
statement
is
ms
myers
but
its
perhaps
later
today
ill
be
able
to
tell
you
with
more
certainty
i
think
thats
still
under
review
but
the
overriding
purpose
of
this
its
not
a
mystery
its
not
meant
to
be
its
just
to
take
questions
q
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
whether
what
the
opening
statement
is
on
ms
myers
since
the
major
purpose
here
is
just
to
take
questions
its
not
completely
resolved
yet
q
dee
dee
one
policy
that
was
expected
last
week
and
that
the
white
house
you
and
george
seemed
to
indicate
we
might
get
would
be
an
aids
czar
will
he
announce
that
today
and
whats
the
delay
on
that
ms
myers
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
imply
i
think
we
said
it
would
happen
soon
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
imply
with
any
certainty
that
it
would
be
this
week
it
is
coming
soon
i
dont
anticipate
that
happening
today
q
whats
the
delay
isnt
this
the
perfect
time
to
announce
an
aids
czar
ms
myers
i
dont
know
that
its
a
delay
i
think
the
process
is
ongoing
to
find
the
best
possible
person
and
to
go
through
the
necessary
background
checks
and
to
make
sure
that
weve
crossed
the
ts
and
dotted
the
is
before
we
make
an
announcement
q
dee
dee
what
are
zoe
bairds
qualifications
for
the
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
and
why
wasnt
her
appointment
announced
here
ms
myers
the
qualifications
i
dont
know
if
theres
a
specific
list
ill
have
to
check
and
see
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
people
there
on
the
board
with
different
backgrounds
many
of
them
have
long
histories
in
intelligence
or
other
government
service
i
think
theres
a
broad
variety
of
views
across
political
spectrum
and
across
backgrounds
that
are
represented
there
we
never
made
a
formal
announcement
other
than
the
chairman
of
the
board
which
is
admiral
william
crowe
q
why
would
he
appoint
her
though
if
the
american
people
and
many
in
the
senate
rejected
her
for
another
government
job
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
that
the
american
people
ever
had
voted
on
her
and
i
certainly
she
was
never
rejected
in
the
senate
she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hearing
but
the
president
believes
shes
a
very
competent
person
hes
said
that
zoe
baird
do
you
understand
what
the
question
is
zoe
baird
is
on
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
q
you
said
she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hearing
q
her
nomination
was
withdrawn
after
public
outrage
over
violating
federal
laws
ms
myers
right
she
never
she
was
never
but
you
said
she
was
rejected
by
the
senate
i
was
just
simply
trying
to
point
out
that
she
was
never
voted
on
by
the
senate
q
so
you
dont
think
that
is
any
problem
ms
myers
i
dont
think
theres
any
problem
q
she
has
been
appointed
to
this
board
is
that
a
fact
ms
myers
yes
q
does
she
need
confirmation
for
this
does
she
need
confirmation
to
be
a
member
of
the
ms
myers
no
its
a
presidential
appointment
q
usually
announcements
are
made
here
at
the
white
house
was
there
a
decision
not
to
announce
her
publicly
ms
myers
we
didnt
make
an
announcement
people
who
asked
were
told
who
the
members
of
the
board
were
we
didnt
make
an
official
announcement
if
anybodys
interested
in
that
we
can
certainly
put
out
the
list
of
names
q
id
like
to
know
q
dont
such
board
members
dont
you
normally
as
a
matter
of
routinely
put
out
releases
on
all
these
boards
and
presidential
appointment
regardless
of
their
dimension
ms
myers
not
always
but
again
im
happy
to
put
this
out
q
isnt
that
the
standard
practice
q
that
was
past
practice
ms
myers
again
im
happy
to
put
it
out
well
put
out
a
list
of
the
members
of
the
board
today
q
dee
dee
i
dont
want
to
try
to
fail
to
let
you
get
out
of
this
swamp
but
laughter
all
i
really
want
to
know
is
hasnt
it
been
the
practice
in
this
administration
for
such
announcements
to
be
made
routinely
ms
myers
i
think
generally
but
not
always
and
were
happy
to
put
that
out
today
q
what
is
the
board
what
is
her
title
what
is
the
size
of
the
board
ms
myers
there
is
roughly
a
dozen
members
on
the
board
it
is
a
civilian
board
although
their
are
some
obviously
retired
military
personnel
on
the
board
that
provide
input
into
intelligence
policy
for
the
president
again
the
chairman
of
that
board
is
admiral
william
crowe
q
and
did
he
recommend
baird
q
whats
the
name
of
the
board
ms
myers
its
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
pfiab
q
whats
her
qualification
that
she
had
employed
an
illegal
alien
is
that
laughter
ms
myers
do
you
want
an
answer
to
the
question
or
you
just
want
to
make
a
joke
q
let
me
phrase
it
another
way
why
shouldnt
this
appointment
be
viewed
as
a
payback
for
the
difficulty
she
had
a
couple
of
months
ago
ms
myers
because
its
not
q
whats
her
experience
in
foreign
intelligence
ms
myers
shes
an
experienced
attorney
someone
who
the
president
believes
is
very
competent
and
qualified
and
i
think
part
of
the
mission
of
this
board
is
to
provide
civilian
input
not
everybody
on
the
board
is
supposed
to
be
an
intelligence
expert
that
is
not
the
boards
mission
it
is
to
provide
civilian
input
for
the
president
as
he
makes
decisions
regarding
intelligence
matters
he
believes
shes
very
qualified
very
competent
person
enormously
talented
and
has
said
that
throughout
q
is
this
just
a
figment
of
my
overactive
imagination
or
was
there
discussion
early
on
about
abolishing
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
ms
myers
i
dont
think
so
on
december
th
when
he
announced
all
of
his
foreign
policy
advisors
he
announced
that
he
would
had
appointed
admiral
crowe
as
the
head
of
the
board
so
i
dont
believe
theres
ever
been
any
q
earlier
than
that
during
the
transition
ms
myers
no
i
dont
believe
so
it
was
announced
again
on
december
th
admiral
crowe
couldnt
be
there
but
it
was
announced
q
are
members
paid
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
but
ill
doublecheck
q
on
another
subject
on
waco
how
do
you
explain
the
discrepancy
between
the
federal
reports
of
the
autopsies
of
the
bodies
that
are
coming
out
of
waco
and
the
state
i
guess
its
the
texas
ranger
reports
ms
myers
most
of
the
information
is
coming
the
federal
information
is
coming
from
the
site
clearly
theres
been
some
discrepancies
and
the
justice
department
is
looking
into
it
officials
in
the
justice
department
were
told
i
believe
the
day
before
yesterday
that
there
were
several
bodies
found
with
bullet
holes
i
think
theres
some
discrepancy
about
that
and
the
justice
department
is
looking
into
it
q
is
the
president
going
to
get
involved
in
trying
to
sort
out
what
seems
to
be
becoming
a
jurisdictional
morass
down
there
with
some
people
withdrawing
others
saying
theyre
in
charge
but
others
justice
fbi
texas
rangers
all
grabbing
a
piece
of
this
ms
myers
i
dont
know
that
hes
going
to
try
to
mediate
the
dispute
i
mean
ill
let
you
know
if
theres
anything
he
intends
to
do
about
it
but
as
you
know
there
are
several
levels
of
investigation
ongoing
and
were
hopeful
that
they
can
work
together
q
is
there
any
one
agency
or
official
down
there
in
charge
of
everything
ms
myers
i
dont
know
ill
have
to
get
back
to
you
on
that
q
what
is
the
subject
matter
of
sundays
speech
ms
myers
its
going
to
be
fairly
general
i
dont
think
its
going
to
be
any
specific
announcements
i
think
its
going
to
be
sort
of
a
q
does
he
have
a
topic
that
hes
going
to
talk
about
ms
myers
were
still
working
on
it
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
any
announcements
of
like
the
drug
czar
or
something
like
that
q
is
it
sort
of
a
days
speech
sort
of
my
excellent
adventure
for
days
laughter
ms
myers
not
exactly
but
i
think
hell
take
a
little
bit
broader
look
about
whats
happened
in
the
last
q
foreign
domestic
ms
myers
a
little
bit
of
both
but
i
think
a
lot
of
domestic
q
and
overview
ms
myers
yes
more
of
an
overview
than
a
specific
policy
announcement
q
has
there
been
an
agreement
yet
on
a
forum
by
which
the
president
will
address
the
gay
rights
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
it
will
be
a
letter
read
to
the
crowd
by
congresswoman
nancy
pelosi
q
is
that
available
ms
myers
not
yet
but
it
will
be
sure
q
are
you
going
to
put
it
out
here
or
ms
myers
well
probably
put
it
out
here
on
sunday
q
travel
next
week
ms
myers
unclear
q
what
was
the
question
q
likely
ms
myers
i
dont
q
likely
possible
ms
myers
possible
q
whats
possible
ms
myers
travel
q
george
mentioned
yesterday
campaign
finance
reform
and
national
service
legislative
proposals
next
week
do
you
have
days
yet
for
them
ms
myers
not
yet
q
can
you
tell
us
which
order
ms
myers
campaign
finance
reform
first
national
service
later
in
the
week
q
is
there
any
coverage
tomorrow
in
williamsburg
ms
myers
no
q
and
any
report
in
the
aftermath
of
the
day
ms
myers
any
readout
from
the
day
q
readout
ms
myers
its
possible
jeff
eller
will
be
down
there
i
think
he
can
go
through
what
the
president
did
during
the
day
we
dont
expect
any
photo
op
or
anything
other
than
departure
here
in
the
morning
q
dee
dee
the
president
has
not
made
a
regular
practice
as
some
of
his
predecessors
have
of
going
to
camp
david
in
fact
hes
been
there
what
once
or
twice
ms
myers
twice
q
why
this
weekend
ms
myers
he
went
two
weekends
ago
as
you
know
on
the
way
home
from
his
fatherinlaws
funeral
i
think
that
they
found
it
to
be
a
good
experience
and
a
nice
way
for
them
to
spend
some
time
together
as
a
family
and
this
is
just
an
opportunity
to
do
the
same
q
theres
no
march
there
q
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
march
here
ms
myers
no
q
since
hes
going
to
be
in
town
sunday
morning
now
instead
of
in
jamestown
have
you
thought
about
him
making
a
quick
passby
flyover
laughter
ms
myers
hell
fly
straight
to
boston
q
flying
straight
did
you
say
laughter
q
george
took
a
question
yesterday
on
waco
the
president
had
said
on
tuesday
in
the
rose
garden
that
there
was
a
minor
disagreement
on
tactics
between
the
military
advisors
and
the
fbi
and
the
question
was
whether
you
knew
exactly
what
that
was
and
whether
it
related
to
the
use
of
the
particular
kind
of
tear
gas
do
you
have
an
answer
on
that
ms
myers
i
dont
ill
check
the
press
thank
you
end
am
edt
