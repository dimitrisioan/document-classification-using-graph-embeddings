skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
two
thoughts
i
think
that
psychologically
it
will
be
easier
for
the
next
generation
to
accept
genetic
manipulation
it
seems
that
people
frown
upon
messing
with
nature
ignoring
our
eonsold
practice
of
doing
just
that
any
new
human
intervention
is
arrogance
and
hubris
and
manipulation
we
routinely
do
is
natural
and
certainly
not
a
big
deal
most
interesting
human
traits
will
probably
be
massively
polygenetic
and
be
full
of
tradeoffs
in
addition
without
a
positive
social
environment
for
the
cultivation
of
genetic
gifts
having
them
wont
be
the
advantage
its
made
out
to
be
some
people
will
certainly
pursue
it
as
if
it
is
the
grail
but
we
know
how
most
of
those
quests
turn
out
