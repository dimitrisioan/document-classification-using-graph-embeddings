a
good
source
of
information
on
burzynskis
method
is
in
the
cancer
industry
by
pulitzerprize
nominee
ralph
moss
interesting
what
book
got
moss
the
pulitzer
nomination
none
of
the
flyers
for
his
books
mention
this
and
none
of
the
cancer
chronicle
newsletters
that
i
have
mention
this
either
also
a
nonprofit
organization
called
people
against
cancer
which
was
formed
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
cancer
patients
to
access
information
regarding
cancer
therapies
not
endorsed
by
the
cancer
industry
but
which
have
shown
highly
promising
results
all
of
which
are
nontoxic
moss
is
people
against
cancers
director
of
communications
people
against
cancer
seems
to
offer
pretty
questionable
information
not
exactly
the
place
a
cancer
patient
should
be
advised
to
turn
to
most
maybe
all
of
the
infomation
in
their
latest
catalogue
concern
treatments
that
have
been
shown
to
be
ineffective
against
cancer
and
many
of
the
treatments
are
quite
dangerous
as
well
