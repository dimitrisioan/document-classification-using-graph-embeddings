pmscan
it
be
prevented
by
a
diet
change
this
question
came
up
in
sci
med
nutrition
and
im
posting
my
answer
here
only
medical
schools
in
the
us
teach
courses
on
human
nutrition
we
have
already
seen
what
a
lack
of
nutrition
education
can
do
when
candida
and
kidney
stones
present
themselves
to
the
medical
community
i
think
that
the
best
example
of
where
us
medicine
is
really
missing
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
a
knowledge
of
nutrition
is
pms
so
many
womenand
their
husbands
suffer
from
this
disorder
that
it
is
really
criminal
that
most
physicians
in
the
us
are
not
taught
that
pms
is
primarily
caused
by
diet
and
diet
changes
can
prevent
it
from
ever
happpening
before
shooting
your
flames
read
the
entire
article
and
then
decide
if
flaming
is
justified
from
a
poster
in
sci
medi
nutrition
in
a
psychological
anthropology
course
i
am
taking
we
got
sidetracked
onto
a
short
conversation
about
pms
some
rumors
shared
by
several
of
the
students
included
ideas
that
vitamin
levels
sugar
intake
and
caffeine
intake
might
affect
pms
symptoms
is
there
any
data
on
this
or
is
it
just
so
much
hooey
many
thanks
michael
ive
wanted
to
reply
to
this
post
ever
since
i
saw
it
but
i
got
sidetracked
with
candida
pms
is
a
lot
like
candida
blooms
most
physicians
dont
recognize
it
as
a
specific
disease
entity
here
is
everything
that
you
would
ever
want
to
know
about
pms
premenstrual

into
four

subgroups

pmta
is
characterized
by
elevated
blood
estrogen
levels
and
low
progesterone
levels
during
the
luteal
phase
of
a
womens
cycle
pmtc
is
caused
by
the
ingestion
of
large
amounts
of
refined
simple
carbohydrates
during
the
luteal
phase
of
a
womens
cycle
there
is
increased
glucose
tolerance
with
a
flat
glucose
curve
after
oral
glucose
challenge
the
metabolic
findings
believed
to
be
responsible
for
pmtc
are
a
low
magnesium
and
a
low
prostaglandin
e
this
condition
of
hypoglycemia
is
not
unique
to
pms
but
there
are
a
number
of
different
causes
of
hypoglycemia
magnesium

seem

be

suggest
that

supplemenation
should

treatment
for
the
mood
changes
that
occur
during
pms
there
are
numerous
observational
studies
that
have
been
published
in
the
medical
literature
which
also
suggest
that
pms
is
primarily
a
disorder
that
arises
out
of
a
hormone
imbalance
that
is
dietary
in
nature
but
since
observational
studies
are
considered
by
most
physicians
in
sci
med
to
be
anecdotal
in
nature
i
have
not
bothered
to
cite
them
there
are
also
over
a
half
dozen
good
experimental
studies
that
have
been
done
on
multivitamin
and
mineral
supplementation
to
prevent
pms
ive
chosen
the
best
specific
studies
on
individual
vitamins
and
minerals
to
try
to
point
out
that
pms
is
primarily
a
nutritional
disorder
but
doctors
dont
recognize
nutritional
disorders
unless
they
can
see
clinical
pathologyberiberi
pellagra
scruvy
etc
pms
is
probably
the
best
reason
why
every
doctor
being
trained
in
the
us
should
get
a
good
course
on
human
nutrition
