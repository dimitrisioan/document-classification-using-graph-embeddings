hi
all
would
anyone
out
there
in
netland
happen
to
have
an
authentic
surefire
way
of
making
this
great
sauce
that
is
used
to
adorn
gyros
and
souvlaki
thanks
i
have
a
receipe
at
home
that
was
posted
to
me
by
one
of
our
fellow
netters
about
a
month
ago
i
am
recalling
this
from
memory
but
i
think
im
fairly
close
by
the
way
it
was
great
pint
of
plain
yogurt
med
sized
cucumber
finely
shredded
cloves
of
garlic
more
or
less
by
taste
tsp
dill
weed
the
yogurt
is
dumped
into
a
strainer
lined
with
a
coffee
filter
and
allowed
to
drain
at
least
hours
you
can
adjust
the
consistancy
of
the
sauce
by
increasing
this
time
up
to
hours
the
shredded
cuc
is
drained
the
same
way
mix
it
all
together
and
let
it
steep
for
at
least
hours
its
better
the
next
day
and
enjoy
steve
