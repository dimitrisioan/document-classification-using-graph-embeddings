im
not
asking
anyone
here
to
buy
into
the
yeast
connection
book
because
i
dont
know
whats
in
that
book
plain
and
simple
and
to
be
honest
with
you
im
beginning
to
wish
that
it
was
never
written
i
agree
with
this
consensus
that
it
should
not
have
been
written
the
way
it
was
my
doctor
who
claims
to
have
introduced
dr
crook
to
the
possibility
of
candida
overbloom
causing
diffuse
symptoms
way
back
in
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
him
on
this
does
not
like
the
book
because
it
makes
too
many
unfounded
claims
and
is
horribly
written
from
a
scientific
viewpoint
on
the
other
hand
my
doctor
has
always
kept
an
open
mind
on
the
subject
and
does
believe
in
aspects
of
the
yeast
connection
but
i
believe
there
is
some
truth
to
the
book
hopefully
the
right
clinical
studies
can
be
done
to
separate
the
fact
from
the
fiction
in
the
meantime
id
still
encourage
people
who
have
incurable
chronic
sinus
problems
especially
if
they
overused
antibiotics
to
find
a
doctor
to
administer
a
systemictype
antifungal
such
as
itraconazole
along
with
liver
panels
before
during
and
after
treatment
just
to
play
it
safe
it
is
an
empirical
approach
for
sure
but
when
all
else
fails
and
your
ent
says
sorry
youll
just
have
to
live
with
it
it
is
time
to
step
out
and
try
an
empirical
approach
backed
up
with
significant
anecdotal
evidence
dr
ivker
supported
by
plausible
theories
outlined
by
marty
at
this
stage
you
have
little
to
lose
particularly
if
you
use
itraconazole
and
have
the
proper
monitoring
the
health
risk
has
been
shown
through
extensive
clinical
studies
both
in
europe
and
the
us
to
be
very
minimal
with
relatively
healthy
ie
nonaids
patients
im
glad
i
did
this
since
i
saw
remarkable
results
after
only
one
week
on
sporanox
itraconazole
of
course
your
mileage
may
vary
a
lot
everyone
is
different
so
it
may
not
work
for
you
