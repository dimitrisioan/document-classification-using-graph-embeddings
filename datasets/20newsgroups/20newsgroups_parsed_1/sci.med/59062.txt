from
josh
schwimmer
ive
recently
listened
to
a
tape
by
dr
stanislaw
burzynski
in
which
he
claims
to
have
discovered
a
series
naturally
occuring
peptides
with
anti
cancer
properties
that
he
names
antineoplastons
burzynski
says
that
his
work
has
met
with
hostility
in
the
united
states
despite
the
favorable
responses
of
his
subjects
during
clinical
trials
what
is
the
generally
accepted
opinion
of
dr
burzynskis
research
he
paints
himself
as
a
lone
researcher
with
a
new
breakthrough
battling
an
intolerant
medical
establishment
but
i
have
no
basis
from
which
to
judge
his
claims
two
weeks
ago
however
i
read
that
the
nihs
department
of
alternative
medicine
has
decided
to
focus
their
attention
on
burzynskis
work
their
budget
is
so
small
that
i
imagine
they
wouldnt
investigate
a
treatment
that
didnt
seem
promising
any
opinions
on
burzynskis
antineoplastons
or
information
about
the
current
status
of
his
research
would
be
appreciated
