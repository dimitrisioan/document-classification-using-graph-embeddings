this
was
known
long
ago
brain
produces
and
uses
some
msg
naturally
but
not
in
doses
it
is
served
at
some
chinese
places
having
said
that
i
might
add
that
in
mho
msg
does
not
enhance
flavor
enoughf
for
me
to
miss
it
when
i
go
to
chinese
places
i
order
food
without
msg
goos
places
will
do
it
for
you
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
some
of
the
food
particularly
the
soups
are
prepared
in
a
big
batch
so
the
restaurant
wont
be
able
to
take
the
msg
out
of
it
sometimes
its
pretty
hard
to
find
out
if
this
is
the
case
or
not
