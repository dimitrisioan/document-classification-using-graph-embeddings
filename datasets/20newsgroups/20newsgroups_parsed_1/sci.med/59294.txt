like
the
term

more
appropriately
called

my
opinion
using
laetril
to
treat
cancer
patients
when
such
treatment
has
been
shown
to
be
ineffective

hmm
this
is
certainly
among
the
things
i
would
refer
to
as
quack
therapy
and
would
tend
to
refer
to
any
practitioner
who
prescribed
laetrile
whether
licensed
or
not
as
a
quack
there
are
unethical
behaviors
such
as
ordering
unneccessary
tests
to
increase
fees
which
i
would
not
lable
as
quackish
but
prescribing
known
ineffective
therapies
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
