i
am
neither
a
real
believer
nor
a
disbeliever
when
it
comes
to
socalled
paranormal
stuff
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
is
just
as
likely
as
the
existence
of
for
instance
a
god
which
seems
to
be
quite
accepted
in
our
societies
without
any
scientific
basis
oooooh
bad
example
im
an
atheist
this
is
not
flame
or
abuse
nor
do
i
want
to
start
another
thread
this
is
after
all
supposed
to
be
about
image
processing
but
to
say
youre
an
atheist
is
to
suggest
you
have
proof
there
is
no
god
to
be
a
politicallycorrect
skeptic
better
to
go
with
agnostic
like
me
