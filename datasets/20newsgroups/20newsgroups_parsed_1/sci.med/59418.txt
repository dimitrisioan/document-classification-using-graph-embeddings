yup
the
demonstration
to
which
you
refer
consists
of
placing
a
leaf
between
the
plates
and
taking
a
kirlian
photograph
of
it
you
then
cut
off
part
of
the
leaf
put
the
top
plate
back
on
and
take
another
kirlian
photograph
you
see
pretty
much
the
same
image
in
both
cases
turns
out
the
effect
isnt
nearly
so
striking
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
clean
the
plates
between
photographs
seems
that
the
moisture
from
the
leaf
that
you
left
on
the
place
conducts
electricity
surprise
surprise
this
is
true
but
its
not
quite
the
whole
story
there
were
actually
some
people
who
were
more
careful
in
their
methodology
who
also
replicated
the
phantom
leaf
effect
you
can
also
replicate
the
effect
with
a
rock
take
your
first
kirlian
photograph
then
moisten
one
edge
of
the
rock
lo
and
behold
phantom
rock

hey
i
understand
vaxen
and
vms
thats
what
i
get
paid
for
my
understanding
of
astronomy
is
purely
at
the
amateur
level
or
below
so
unless
what
im
saying
is
directly
related
to
vaxvms
dont
hold
me
or
my
organization
responsible
for
it
if
it
is
related
to
vaxvms
you
can
try
to
hold
me
responsible
for
it
but
my
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
