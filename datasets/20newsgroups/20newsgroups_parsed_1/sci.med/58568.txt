spoofing
a
keyboard
over
the
serial
port
if
youve
got
a
proprietary
computer
which
uses
its
own
keyboard
sun
hp
dec
etc
then
youre
going
to
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
vendor
to
sell
you
a
compatible
keyboard
if
your
workstation
runs
the
x
window
system
youre
in
luck
you
can
buy
a
cheap
used
pc
hook
your
expensive
keyboard
up
to
it
and
run
a
serial
cable
to
your
workstation
then
run
a
program
on
the
workstation
to
read
the
serial
port
and
generate
fake
x
keyboard
events
the
two
main
programs
ive
found
to
do
this
are
kt
and
ax
ax
is
a
sophisticated
program
capable
of
controlling
the
mouse
and
even
moving
among
widgets
on
the
screen
it
requires
a
server
extension
xtest
decxtrap
or
xtestextension
to
find
out
if
your
server
can
do
this
run
xdpyinfo
and
see
if
any
of
these
strings
appear
in
the
extensions
list
if
your
server
doesnt
have
this
you
may
want
to
investigate
compiling
xr
patchlevel
or
later
or
bugging
your
vendor
kt
is
a
simpler
program
which
should
work
with
unextended
x
servers
another
program
called
xsendevent
also
exists
but
i
havent
seen
it
both
ax
and

if
you
have
an

you
may
be
all
set
try
it
out
with
a
normal
pc
keyboard
before
you
go
through
the
trouble
of
buying
an
alternative
keyboard
also
some

add

you
may
need
to
keep
your
original

around
for
the

you
have

next
next

meaning

apple
has
recently
announced
their

the
keyboard
has
one
section
for
each
hand
and
the
sections
rotate
backward
on
a
hinge
the
sections
do
not
tilt
upward
the
keys
are
arranged
in
a
normal
qwerty
fashion
the
main
foldable
keyboard
resembles
a
normal
apple
keyboard
a
separate
keypad
contains
all
the
extended
key
functions
the
keyboard
also
comes
with
matching
wrist

which
are
not

the

is
relatively

for
the

the
idea
is
that
one

works
with
everything
you
purchase
compatibility
modules
a
new
cord
and
possibly
new
keycaps
and
then
you
can
move
your
one
keyboard
around
among
different
machines
its
a
threepiece
folding
keyboard
the
layout
resembles
the
standard

keyboard
except
sliced
into
three
sections
each
section
is
on
a
custom
telescoping
universal
mount
each
section
independently
adjusts
to
an
infinite
number
of
positions
allowing
each
individual
to
type
in
a

you
can
rearrange
the
three
sections
too
have
the
keypad

if
you

each
