chinese
and
many
other
asians
japanese
koreans
etc
have
used
msg
as
flavor
enhancer
for
two
thousand
years
do
you
believe
that
they
knew
how
to
make
msg
from
chemical
processes
not
they
just
extracted
it
from
natural
food
such
sea
food
and
meat
broth
and
to
add
further
fuel
to
the
flame
war
i
read
about
years
ago
that
the
natural
msg
extracted
from
the
sources
you
mention
above
does
not
cause
the
reported
aftereffects
its
only
that
nasty
artificial
msg
extracted
from
coal
tar
or
whatever
that
causes
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
i
find
this
pretty
hard
to
believe
has
anyone
else
heard
it
i
was
under
the
possibly
incorrect
assumption
that
most
of
the
msg
on
our
foods
was
made
from
processing
sugar
beets
is
this
not
true
are
there
other
sources
of
msg
i
am
one
of
those
folx
who
react
sometimes
strongly
to
msg
however
i
also
react
strongly
to
sodium
chloride
table
salt
in
excess
each
causes
different
symptoms
except
for
the
common
one
of
rapid
heartbeat
and
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
pressure
in
my
chest
upper
left
quadrant
