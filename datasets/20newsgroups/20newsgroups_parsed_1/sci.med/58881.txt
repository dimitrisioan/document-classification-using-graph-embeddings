i
dont
doubt
that
the
placebo
effect
is
alive
and
well
with
jb
rr
every
medical
modality
estimated
by
some
to
be
around
jb
rr
but
why
would
it
be
higher
with
alternative
versus
conventional

medicine

because
most
the
the
time
closer
to
in
my
experience
there
is
no
jb
substance
to
the
alternative
intervention
beyond
the
good
intentions
of
the
jb
practitioner
which
in
itself
is
quite
therapeutic

well
if
thats
the
case
in
your
practice
i
have
a
hard
time
figuring
out
how
you
even
managed
to
make
it
into
the
bottom
half
of
your
class
or
did
you
create
your
diplomas
with
crayons
if
someone
runs
a
medical
practice
with
only
a
success
rate
they
either
tackle
problems
for
which
they
are
not
qualified
to
treat
or
they
have
no
conscience
and
are
only
in
business
for
fraudulent
purposes
otoh
who
are
we
kidding
the
new
england
medical
journal
in
ran
the
heading
ninety
percent
of
diseases
are
not
treatable
by
drugs
or
surgery
which
has
been
echoed
by
several
other
reports
no
wonder
mds
are
not
amused
with
alternative
medicine
since
the
magic
of
the
placebo
effect
would
award
alternative
practitioners
twice
the
success
rate
of
conventional
medicine
