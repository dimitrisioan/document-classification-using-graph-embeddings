anthony

we

that
the

that

has
been
a

of

the

the

in

berkley
disagrees
with
the
contention
that
aids
is
receiving
too
much
attention
hiv
differs
from
other
diseases
in
most
developing
countries
because
it
is
continuing
to
spread
for
most
endemic
diseases
the
outcome
of
neglecting
interventions
for
one
year
is
another
year
of
about
the
same
level
of
needless
disease
and
death
but
with
aids
and
its
increasing
spread
the
cost
of
neglect
not
only
in
disease
burden
but
financially
is
much
greater
interventions
in
the
early
part
of
a
rampantly
spreading
epidemic
like
hiv
are
highly
costeffective
because
each
individual
infection
prevented
significantly
interrupts
transmission
berkley
says
he
agrees
with
gellert
and
nordenberg
about
the
gigantic
social
and
economic
effects
of

about
the
need
for
political
leadership
but
he
concludes
that
not
only
is
assertive
political
leadership
needed
in
the

for

even
more
so

new
evidence
that
the
hiv
can
cause
disease
independently
news
from
the
national
institute
of
dental
research
there
is
new
evidence
that
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
can
cause
disease
independently
of
its
ability
to
suppress
the
immune
system
say
scientists
at
the
national
institues
of
health
they
report
that
hiv
itself
not
an
opportunistic
infection
caused
scaling
skin
conditions
to
develop
in
mice
carrying
the
genes
for
hiv
although
the
hiv
genes
were
active
in
the
mice
they
did
not
compromise
the
animals
immunity
the
researchers
found
this
led
them
to
conclude
that
the
hiv
itself
caused
the
skin
disease
our
findings
support
a
growing
body
of
evidence
that
hiv
can
cause
disease
without
affecting
the
immune
system
said
lead
author
dr
jeffrey
kopp
of
the
national
institute
of
dental
research
nidr
dr
kopp
and
his
colleagues
described
their
study
in
the
march
issue
of
aids
research
and
human
retroviruses
developing
animal
models
of
hiv
infection
has
been
difficult
since
most
animals
including
mice
can
not
be
infected
by
the
virus
to
bypass
this
problem
scientists
have
developed
hivtransgenic
mice
which
carry
genes
for
hiv
as
well
as
their
own
genetic
material
nidr
scientists
created
the
transgenic
mice
by
injecting
hiv
genes
into
mouse
eggs
and
then
implanting
the
eggs
into
female
mice
the
resulting
litters
contained
both
normal
and
transgenic
animals
institute
scientists
had
created
mice
that
carried
a
complete
copy
of
hiv
genetic
material
in
l
those
mice
however
became
sick
and
died
too
soon
after
birth
to
study
in
depth
in
the
present
study
the
scientists
used
an
incomplete
copy
of
hiv
which
allowed
the
animals
to
live
longer
some
of
the
transgenic
animals
developed
scaling
wartlike
tumors
on
their
necks
and
backs
other
transgenic
mice
developed
thickened
crusting
skin
lesions
that
covered
most
of
their
bodies
resembling
psoriasis
in
humans
no
skin
lesions
developed
in
their
normal
nontransgenic
littermates
studies
of
tissue
taken
from
the
wartlike
skin
tumors
showed
that
they
were
a
type
of
noncancerous
tumor
called
papilloma
although
the
papillomavirus
can
cause
these
skin
lesions
laboratory
tests
showed
no
sign
of
that
virus
in
the
animals
tissue
samples
taken
from
the
sick
mice
throughout
the
study
revealed
the
presence
of
a
proteinproducing
molecule
made
by
the
hiv
genetic
material

evidence
of
hiv
protein
production
proved
that
the
viral
genes
were
turned
on
or
active
said
dr
kopp
the
scientists
found
no
evidence
however
of
compromised
immunity
in
the
mice
no
increase
in
their
white
blood
cell
count
and
no
signs
of
common
infections
the
fact
that
hiv
genes
were
active
but
the
animals
immune
systems
were
not
suppressed
confirms
that
the
virus
itself
was
causing
the
skin
lesions
dr
kopp
said
further
proof
of
hiv
gene
involvement
came
from
a
test
in
which
the
scientists
exposed
the
transgenic
animals
to
ultraviolet
light
the
light
increased
hiv
genetic
activity
causing
papillomas
to
develop
on
formerly
healthy
skin
papilloma
formation
in
response
to
increased
hiv
genetic
activity
proved
the
genes
were
responsible
for
the
skin
condition
the
scientists
said
no
lesions
appeared
on
normal
mice
exposed
to
the
uv
light
the
transgenic
mice
used
in
this
study
were
developed
at

today
announced
the
first
nationwide
clinical
consultation
telephone
service
for
doctors
and
other
health
care
professionals
who
have
questions
about
providing
care
to
people
with
hiv
infection
or
aids
the
tollfree
national
hiv
telephone
consulting
service
is
staffed
by
a
physician
a
nurse
practitioner
and
a
pharmacist
it
provides
information
on
drugs
clinical
trials
and
the
latest
treatment
methods
the
service
is
funded
by
the
health
resources
and
services
administration
and
operates
out
of
san
francisco
general
hospital
secretary
shalala
said
one
goal
of
this
project
is
to
share
expertise
so
patients
get
the
best
care
a
second
goal
is
to
get
more
primary
health
care
providers
involved
in
care
for
people
with
hiv
or
aids
which
reduces
treatment
cost
by
allowing
patients
to
remain
with
their
medical
providers
and
community
social
support
networks
currently
many
providers
refer
patients
with
hiv
or
aids
to
specialists
or
other
providers
who
have
more
experience
secretary
shalala
said
this
clinical
expertise
should
be
especially
helpful
for
physicians
and
providers
who
treat
people
with
hiv
or
aids
in
communities
and
clinical
sites
where
hiv
expertise
is
not
readily
available
the
telephone
number
for
health

is
and
it
is
accessible
from

pst
monday
through
friday
during
these
times
consultants
will
try
to
answer
questions
immediately
or
within
an
hour
at
other
times
physicians
and
health
care
providers
can
leave
an
electronic
message
and
questions
will
be
answered
as
quickly
as
possible
health
care
professionals
may
call
the
service
to
ask
any
question
related
to
providing
hiv
care
including
the
latest
hivaids
drug
treatment
information
clinical
trials
information
subspecialty
case
referral
literature
searches
and
other
information
the
service
is
designed
for
health
care
professionals
rather
than
patients
families
or
others
who
have
alternate
sources
of
information
or
materials
when
a
health
care
professional
calls
the
new
service
the
call
is
taken
by
either
a
clinical
pharmacist
primary
care
physician
or
family
nurse
practitioner
all
staff
members
have
extensive
experience
in
outpatient
and
inpatient
primary
