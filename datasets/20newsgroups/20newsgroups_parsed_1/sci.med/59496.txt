someone
please
help
me
i
am
searching
to
find
out
as
many
others
may
an
absolute
cure
to
removing
all
detectable
traces
of
marijuana
from
a
persons
body
is
there
a
chemical
or
natural
substance
that
can
be
ingested
or
added
to
urine
to
make
it
undetectable
in
urine
analysis
if
so
where
can
these
substances
be
found
you
could
do
what
i
do
never
go
near
the
stuff
theres
always
the
old
switcheroo
my
brother
works
at
a
dialysis
clinic
they
were
interviewing
candidates
for
a
technician
job
mainly
electronics
tech
and
a
urine
screen
was
part
of
the
interview
the
bathroom
was
across
the
hall
from
a
lab
one
candidate
managed
to
switch
his
urine
sample
with
one
he
grabbed
from
the
lab
no
one
was
in
it
at
the
time
most
innercity
dialysis
patients
have
quite
a
few
medical
problems
so
it
was
immediately
obvious
what
had
happened
my
brother
fleetingly
considered
telling
the
candidate
im
sorry
but
you
are
very
ill
and
need
medical
attention
immediately
they
offered
him
another
wellmonitored
chance
and
he
declined
