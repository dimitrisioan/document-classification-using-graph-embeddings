re
could
this
be
a
migraine
gb
from
gordon
banks
gb
the
hmo
would
stop
the
overordering
but
in
hmos
tests
are
gb
underordered
thats
a
somewhat
overbroad
statement
im
sure
there
are
hmos
in
which
the
fees
for
lab
tests
are
subtracted
from
the
doctors
income
in
most
however
including
the
one
i
work
for
there
is
no
direct
incentive
to
underorder
profits
of
the
group
are
shared
among
all
partners
but
the
group
is
so
large
that
an
individuals
generated
costs
have
a
miniscule
effect
i
dont
believe
that
we
underorder
then
again
im
not
really
sure
what
the
right
amount
of
ordering
is
or
should
be
relative
to
the
average
british
neurologist
i
suspect
that
i
rather
drastically
overorder
