proteins
writes
about
heat
shock
proteins
hsps
and
dna
i
hate
to
be
derogatory
but
in
this
case
i
think
its
warranted
hsps
are
part
of
the
cellular
response
to
stress
the
only
reason
they
are
called
heat
shock
proteins
is
because
they
were
first
demonstrated
using
heat
shock
dead
tissue
ie
meat
is
not
going
to
produce
any
protein
because
its
dead
also
who
cares
if
the
dna
you
are
ingesting
is
mutated
it
will
be
completely
digested
in
your
stomach
which
is
about
ph
some
of
you
worry
way
too
much
eat
a
healthy
balanced
diet
and
relax
my
advice
is
if
you
dont
know
what
you
are
talking
about
it
is
better
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
than
to
open
it
and
remove
all
doubt
about
your
ignorance
dont
speculate
or
at
least
get
some
concrete
information
before
you
do
