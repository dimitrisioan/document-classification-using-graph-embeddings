anecedotal
evidence
is
worthless
even
doctors
who
have
been
using
a
drug
or
treatment
for
years
and
who
swear
it
is
effective
are
often
suprised
at
the
results
of
clinical
trials
whether
or
not
msg
causes
describable
reportable
documentable
symptoms
should
be
pretty
simple
to
discover
i
tend
to
disagree
i
think
anecdotal
evidence
provided
there
is
a
lot
of
it
and
it
is
fairly
consistent
will
is
very
important
first
it
points
to
the
necessity
of
doing
a
study
and
second
it
at
least
says
that
the
effects
are
all
psychological
or
possibly
allergy
in
this
case
as
ive
pointed
out
before
pyschological
effects
are
no
less
real
than
other
effects
one
persons
makebelieve
can
easily
be
another
persons
reality
using
psychadelic
drugs
in
a
bizarre
and
twisted
example
the
hallucinations
one
person
experiences
on
an
acid
trip
can
not
be
guaranteed
to
another
person
on
an
acid
trip
there
is
no
clinical
evidence
that
those
effects
are
always
going
to
happen
anyhow
that
was
a
pretty
lame
example
but
hopefully
i
made
my
point
its
all
a
matter
of
perception
and
as
long
as
someone
ingesting
msg
perceives
it
as
causing
bad
effects
then
she
can
definitely
experience
those
affects
on
the
other
hand
it
could
just
be
an
allergy
to
the
food
its
in
or
something
still
anecdotal
evidence
is
not
worthless
its
the
stuff
that
leads
to
the
study
being
done
dan
