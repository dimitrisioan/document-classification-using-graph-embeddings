a
friend
of
mine
has
a
trouble
with
her
ears
ringing
the
ringing
is
so
loud
that
she
has
great
difficulty
sleeping
at
night
she
says
that
she
hasnt
had
a
normal
nights
sleep
in
about
months
she
looks
like
it
too
this
is
making
her
depressed
so
her
doctor
has
put
her
on
antidepressants
sometimes
i
have
a
problem
with
doctors
prescribing
medicine
like
this
i
of
course
dont
know
the
exact
situation
and
antidepressants
may
work
but
it
isnt
helping
the
ringing
at
all
is
it
the
ringing
started
rather
suddenly
about
months
ago
she
is
quickly
losing
sleep
social
life
and
sanity
over
this
mine
started
about
three
years
back
turns
out
i
have
tinnitus
bilateral
translation
ringing
in
both
ears
basically
if
this
is
what
it
is
shell
probably
get
used
to
it
it
would
keep
me
up
and
drive
me
nuts
too
but
nowadays
i
have
to
plug
both
my
ears
with
my
fingers
to
check
to
see
if
they
are
ringing
usually
they
are
but
you
get
so
used
to
it
it
just
gets
tuned
out
yes
this
is
what
ive
read
about
it
not
just
from
my
own
personal
experience
does
anyone
know
of
any
treatments
for
this
any
experience
coping
mechanisms
any
opinions
on
the
antidepressant
drugs
millions
have
it
according
to
my
physician
you
just
learn
to
cope
with
it
like
i
mentioned
earlier
by
ignoring
it
it
eventually
becomes
unconscious
the
doc
also
said
it
could
be
caused
by
diet
ie
too
much
caffeine
and
stress
but
i
havent
changed
my
lifestyle
much
and
it
just
comes
and
goes
it
is
always
there
somewhat
but
now
i
rarely
notice
it
when
it
really
kicks
in
also
it
doesnt
necessarily
mean
there
is
any
hearing
loss
either
caused
by
it
or
causing
it
i
had
an
ent
earnosethroat
exam
and
passed
in
fact
my
hearing
is
quite
good
considering
i
dont
take
as
good
of
care
of
my
hearing
as
i
should
her
reaction
is
normal
if
it
is
tinnitus
chances
are
good
shell
begin
to
not
even
notice
it
this
info
is
taken
mostly
from
a
few
experts
my
own
experience
and
some
readings
sorry
it
was
a
few
years
back
and
dont
have
any
specifics
handy
