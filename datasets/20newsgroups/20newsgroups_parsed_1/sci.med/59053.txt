re
any
info
on
vasomotor
rhinitis
disclaimer
im
a
sufferer
not
a
doctor
im
not
sure
theres
a
really
sharp
distinction
between
allergic
and
vasomotor
rhinitis
basically
vasomotor
rhinitis
means
your
nose
is
stuffy
when
it
has
no
reason
to
be
not
even
an
identifiable
allergy
decongestants
and
steroid
sprays
work
for
vasomotor
rhinitis
also
i
can
get
surprising
relief
from
purely
superficial
measures
such
as
saline
moisturizing
spray
and
moisturizing
gel
