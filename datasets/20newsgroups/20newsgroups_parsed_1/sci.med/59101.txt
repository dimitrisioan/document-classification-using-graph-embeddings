there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
such
a
disease
exists
theres
a
lot
of
evidence
it
just
hasnt
been
adequately
gathered
and
published
in
a
way
that
will
convince
the
diehard
melancholic
skeptics
who
quiver
everytime
the
word
anecdote
or
empirical
is
used
no
theres
no
evidence
that
would
convince
any
but
the
most
credulous
the
evidence
is
identical
to
the
sort
of
evidence
that
has
been
used
to
justify
all
sorts
of
quack
treatments
for
quack
diseases
in
the
past
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some
who
hold
too
firmly
to
the
party
line
are
academics
who
havent
been
in
the
trenches
long
enough
actually
treating
patients
i
like
the
implication
here
it
must
not
be
that
the
quacks
making
millions
off
such
diseases
are
biased
rather
that
those
who
doubt
their
existence
dont
understand
the
real
world
it
seems
easy
to
picture
a
th
centure
snake
oil
salesman
saying
the
same
thing
however
i
have
been
in
the
trenches
long
enough
to
have
seen
multiple
quack
diseases
rise
and
fall
in
popularity
systemic
yeast
syndome
seems
to
be
making
a
resurgence
it
had
fallen
off
a
few
years
ago
there
will
be
new
such
diseases
im
sure
with
bestselling
books
and
expensive
therapies
if
anybody
doctors
included
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
yeast
connection
i
can
not
guarantee
their
safety
for
their
incompetence
ripping
off
their
lips
is
justified
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
well
this
of
course
is
convincing
i
guess
id
better
start
diagnosing
any
illnesses
that
people
want
so
that
i
can
keep
my
lips
