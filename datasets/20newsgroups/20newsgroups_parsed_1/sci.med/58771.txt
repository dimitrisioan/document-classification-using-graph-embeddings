if
instead
of
using
the
msg
as
a
food
additive
you
put
the
msg
in
gelatin
capsules
or
whatever
there
may
not
be
a
reaction
becasue
the
sensoryresponse
might
be
a
necessary
element
in
the
creation
of
the
msg

never
even

do
know
about
this
carl

is
not
placebo
effect
if
as
hypothesised
the
sensory
response
to
msgs
effect
on
flavor
is
