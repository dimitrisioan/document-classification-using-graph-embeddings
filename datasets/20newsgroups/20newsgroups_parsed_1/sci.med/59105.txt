some
recent
postings
remind
me
that
i
had
read
about
risks
associated
with
the
barbecuing
of
foods
namely
that
carcinogens
are
generated
is
this
a
valid
concern
if
so
is
it
a
function
of
the
smoke
or
the
elevated
temperatures
is
it
a
function
of
the
cooking
elements
wood
or
charcoal
vs
lava
rocks
i
wish
to
know
more
thanks
ive
read
mixed
opinions
on
this
singed
meat
can
contain
carcinogens
but
unless
you
eat
barbecued
meat
every
meal
youre
probably
not
at
much
risk
i
think
i
will
live
life
on
the
edge
and
grill
my
food
ive
also
read
that
using
petroleum
based
charcoal
starter
can
put
some
unwanted
toxins
in
your
food
or
at
least
unwanted
odor
ive
been
using
egg
carton
cups
dipped
in
paraffin
for
fire
starters
and
it
actually
lights
faster
and
easier
than
lighter
fluid
several
people
have
told
me
that
they
have
excellent
results
with
a
chimney
basically
a
steel
cylinder
with
wholes
punched
in
the
side
ive
been
meaning
to
get
one
of
these
but
one
hasnt
presented
itself
while
ive
been
out
shopping
you
can
make
one
from
a
coffee
can
but
i
buy
my
coffee
as
whole
beans
in
a
bag
so
i
havent
had
a
big
enough
can
laying
around
