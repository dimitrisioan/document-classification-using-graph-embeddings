i
am
looking
for
a
rat
cell
line
of
adrenal
gland
cortical
cell
type
i
have
been
looking
at
atcc
without
success
and
would
very
much
appreciate
any
help
i
shot
off
a
response
to
this
last
night
that
ive
tried
to
cancel
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
later
while
driving
home
that
i
remembered
that
your
message
does
specifically
say
cortical
my
first
reaction
had
been
to
suggest
the
pc
pheochromocytoma
line
that
may
still
be
a
good
compromise
depending
on
what
youre
doing
have
you
concidered
using
a
mouse
cell
line
from
one
of
the
sv
t
antigen
transgenic
lines
another
alternative
might
be
primary
cells
from
bovine
adrenal
cortex
