rashes
i
get
em
every
time
the
subjectline
says
it
every
time
i
run
a
fever
i
get
an
amazing
rosy
rash
over
my
torso
and
arms
fortunately
it
doesnt
itch
the
rash
always
comes
on
the
day
after
the
fever
breaks
and
no
matter
what
the
illness
was
cold
flu
whatever
it
started
happening
about
four
years
ago
after
i
moved
to
my
current
town
although
i
dont
know
if
that
has
anything
to
do
with
anything
severity
and
persistance
of
the
rash
seems
to
vary
with
the
fever
a
severe
or
longlasting
fever
brings
a
longlasting
rash
a
mild
fever
seems
to
bring
rashes
that
go
away
faster
anybody
know
what
might
be
causing
this
its
no
more
than
an
embarassment
but
id
be
curious
to
know
whats
going
on
am
i
carrying
some
kind
of
feverresistant
bug
that
goes
wild
when
fever
knocks
out
its
competition
