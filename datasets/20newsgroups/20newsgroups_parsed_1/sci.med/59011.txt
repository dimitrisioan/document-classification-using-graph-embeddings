re
obgyn
residency
reply
to
gordon
banks
i
believe
it
is
illegal
for
a
residency
to
discriminate
against
fmgs
is
that
true
i
know
some
that
wont
even
interview
fmgs
i
think
a
case
could
be
made
that
this
is
discriminatory
particularly
if
an
applicant
had
good
board
scores
and
recommendations
but
wasnt
offered
an
interview
but
i
dont
know
if
it
has
ever
gone
to
court
david
nye
midelfort
clinic
eau
claire
wi
this
is
patently
absurd
but
whoever
wishes
to
become
a
philosopher
must
learn
not
to
be
frightened
by
absurdities
