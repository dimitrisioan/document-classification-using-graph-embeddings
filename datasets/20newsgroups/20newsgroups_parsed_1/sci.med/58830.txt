we
cant
hope
currently
at

to
explain
how
or
why
kekule
had
the
daydream
of
snakes
in
the
fire
biting
their
tails
surely
it
wasnt
the
only
daydream
he
had
what
was

about
this
one
could
it
have
had
something
to
do
with
a
perceived
analogy
between
the
geometry
of
the
snakes
and
problems
concerning
geometry
of
molecules
is
such
analogical
reasoning
extrascientific
or
is
it
rather
at
the
very
heart
of
science
perices
notion

the
use

a
formal

often
incomplete
