i
recently
learned
about
these
devices
that
supposedly
induce
specific
brain
wave
frequencies
in
their
users
simply
by
wearing
them
the
principle
underlying
these
devices
is
a
well
establish
principle
in
psychology
called
entrainment
whereby
external
sensory
stimuli
influence
gross
electrical
patterns
of
brain
function
they
are
experimental
in
that
people
experiment
with
them
and
they
are
not
widely
if
at
all
used
in
medicine
for
therapeutic
purposes
given
the
exception
of
tens
and
similar
units
used
for
external
electrical
stimulation
usually
for
pain
relief
not
really
a
light
and
sound
machine
they
are
not
experimental
in
the
sense
of
a
specific
medical
category
to
that
effect
as
with
experimental
drugs
as
the
fda
does
not
specifically
regulate
medical
devices
in
the
way
it
does
pharmaceuticals
i
would
think
that
if
they
work
as
reported
they
would
be
incredibly
useful
there
are
few
reliable
studies
of
therapeutic
or
enhancement
effects
for
mind
machines
other
than
those
relaxationrelated
effects
found
with
meditation
or
selfhypnosis
as
well
reported
benefits
are
mostly
anecdotal
and
subjective
so
far
so
its
hard
to
generalize
about
their
potential
value
a
pretty
good
general
nontechnical
introduction
to
a
wide
variety
of
these
devices
may
be
found
in
would
the
buddha
wear
a
walkman
some
interesting
background
material
names
of
suppliers
and
capsule
reviews
of
specific
equipment
do
these
mind
machines
aka
light
and
sound
machines
work
can
they
induce
alpha
theta
andor
delta
waves
in
a
person
wearing
them
what
research
if
any
has
been
done
on
them
could
they
be
used
in
lieu
of
a
tranquilizer
or
are
they
just
another
bit
of
quackery
a
more
important
question
might
be
whether
they
have
enough
additional
value
to
be
worth
investing
in
biofeedback
was
found
to
be
a
legitimate
and
reliable
effect
experimentally
under
certain
conditions
in
that
it
demonstrated
that
we
can
influence
physiological
processes
previously
considered
purely
autonomic
but
never
panned
out
as
a
particularly
valuable
therapeutic
tool
because
of
the
skill
level
required
and
the
subtlety
and
temporary
nature
of
the
effects
in
most
cases
maybe
someone
else
has
more
there
used
to
be
a
whole
mailing
list
devoted
to
mind
machines
somewhere
on
the
net
