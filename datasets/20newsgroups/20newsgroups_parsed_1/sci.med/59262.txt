as
for
how
foods
taste
if
im
not
allergic
to
msg
and
i
like
the
taste
of
it
why
shouldnt
i
use
it
saying
i
shouldnt
use
it
is
like
saying
i
shouldnt
eat
spicy
food
because
my
neighbor
has
an
ulcer
julie
it
doesnt
necessarily
follow
that
you
should
use
it
msg
or
something
else
for
that
matter
simply
because
you
are
not
allergic
to
it
for
example
you
might
not
be
allergic
to
animal
fats
and
like
their
taste
yet
it
doesnt
follow
that
you
should
be
using
them
regularly
msg
might
have
other
bad
or
good
i
am
not
up
on
knowledge
of
msg
effects
on
your
body
in
the
long
run
maybe
thats
reason
enough
not
to
use
it
altho
your
example
of
the
ulcer
is
funny
it
isnt
an
appropriate
comparison
at
all
prakash
das
