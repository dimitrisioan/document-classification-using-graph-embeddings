re
lyme
vaccine

my
nearly
year
old
pomeranian
had
a
nasty
reaction
to
this
vaccination
suffice
it
to
say
we
will
not
vaccinate
her
for
lyme
disease
again
shes
been
camping
through
some
states
and
has
backpacked
with
us
as
well
and
we
are
used
to
watching
for
ticks
and
dealing
with
them
and
we
simply
wont
take
her
to
really
active
lyme
disease
areas
not
to
drag
this
out
anymore
but
many
veterinarians
feel
that
lyme
disease
in
dogs
is
so
easy
to
treat
that
in
an
endemic
area
they
often
just
give
the
appropriate
antibiotics
to
dogs
presenting
with
lameness
swollen
joints
fever
a
recent
paper
march
has
finally
established
that
lyme
disease
in
dogs
can
be
reproduced
in
a
controlled
experimentaly
setting
this
has
been
an
ellusive
matter
for
researchers
and
is
one
of
the
fundamental
requirements
for
many
to
acknowledge
an
agent
as
being
causitive
of
a
particular
disease
up
to
now
only
the
vaccine
manufacturer
has
been
able
to
prove
that
the
disease
exists
this
paper
is
noteworthy
in
two
other
regards
none
of
the
animals
they
infected
were
treated
in
any
way
the
dogs
had
episodes
of
lameness
during
a
week
period
which
occurred
months
after
exposure
after
this
period
none
showed
any
further
clinical
signs
up
to
the
month
observation
period
of
the
study
so
these
are
proven
clinically
sick
lyme
patients
showing
spontaneous
recovery
without
the
benefit
of
drug
treatment
of
course
observations
longer
than
months
will
be
necessary
to
be
sure
the
disease
doesnt
have
the
same
chronicity
that
some
see
in
humans
the
addendum
to
the
paper
calls
into
question
the
techniques
used
by
the
vaccine
manufacturer
to
validate
the
vaccine
of
course
they
want
the
world
to
use
the
model
they
developed
in
order
to
test
vaccine
efficacy
anyway
maybe
we
will
see
some
independent
scientifically
sound
evaluations
of
this
vaccine
in
the
next
year
or
