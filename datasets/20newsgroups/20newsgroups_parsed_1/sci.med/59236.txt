writes
poster
for
being
treated
by
a
liscenced
physician
for
a
disease
that
did
not
exist
calling
this
physician
a
quack
was
reprehensible
steve
and
i
see
that
you
and
some
of
the
others
are
doing
it
here
as
well
do
you
believe
that
any
quacks
exist
how
about
quack
diagnoses
is
being
a
licensed
physician
enough
to
guarantee
that
someone
is
not
a
quack
or
is
it
just
that
even
if
a
licensed
physician
is
a
quack
other
people
shouldnt
say
so
can
you
give
an
example
of
a
commonly
diagnosed
ailment
that
you
think
is
a
quack
diagnosis
or
have
we
gotten
to
the
point
in
civilization
where
we
no
longer
need
to
worry
about
unscrupulous
healers
taking
advantage
of
people
david
rind
sure
there
are
quacks
there
are
quacks
who
dont
treat
and
quacks
who
treat
ones
that
refuse
to
diagnose
and
ones
that
diagnose
improperly
there
are
lucky
quacks
and
unlucky
quacks
smart
quacks
and
dumb
ones
there
are
people
ahead
of
their
time
with
unprobable
or
unproven
theories
and
rationals
there
are
illreasoned
absurd
theorists
sometimes
its
hard
to
tell
whos
who
reading
a
book
of
ancient
jokes
it
seems
that
doctors
called
other
doctors
quacks
in
babylon
arguments
abound
when
there
arent
any
firm
answers
plenty
of
illnesses
arent
or
cant
be
diagnosed
or
treated
but
i
think
its
better
to
argue
against
the
theory
as
was
originally
done
with
postings
on
candida
a
month
or
so
ago
stating
the
facts
usually
works
better
than
simply
asserting
an
opinion
about
someones
competency
and
you
cant
convince
everybody
sometimes
a
correct
diagnosis
takes
years
for
people
they
dont
run
into
a
doctor
who
recognizes
the
disease
they
havent
developed
something
recognizable
yet
or
they
have
something
that
no
one
is
going
to
recognize
because
it
hasnt
been
described
yet
sometimes
they
get
a
cure
sometimes
the
illness
wears
out
sometimes
they
stumble
on
an
improper
diagnosis
with
the
right
treatment
sometimes
they
find
its
incurable
there
is
no
profit
in
a
patient
accepting
a
hopeless
attitude
about
an
illness
unless
its
a
rock
solid
diagnosis
of
terminal
disease
its
is
more
like
ly
that
a
person
will
find
a
cure
if
they
keep
looking
