hi
ive
just
returned
from
a
visit
with
my
obgyn
and
i
have
a
few
concerns
that
maybe
yall
can
help
me
with
ive
been
seeing
her
every
weeks
for
the
past
few
months
im
at
week
and
during
the
last
visits
ive
gained
to
pounds
every
weeks
she
said
this
was
unacceptable
over
any
week
period
as
it
stands
ive
thus
far
gained
pounds
also
she
says
that
though
im
at
weeks
the
babys
size
is
weeks
i
think
she
mentioned
inches
for
the
top
of
the
fundus
when
i
was
weeks
the
babys
size
was
weeks
i
must
also
add
that
i
had
an
operation
a
few
years
ago
for
endometriosis
and
ive
had
no
problems
with
endometriosis
but
apparently
it
is
causing
me
pain
in
my
pelvic
region
during
the
pregnancy
and
i
have
a
very
difficult
time
moving
and
the
doc
has
recommended
i
not
walk
or
move
unless
i
have
to
i
have
a
little
handicapped
sticker
for
when
i
do
need
to
go
out
anyway
thats
of
the
situation
the
other
is
that
almost
from
the
beginning
of
pregnancy
i
was
getting
sick
throwing
up
about
times
a
day
and
mostly
it
was
bile
that
was
being
eliminated
i
told
her
about
this
i
know
this
because
i
wasnt
eating
very
much
due
to
the
nausea
and
could
see
the
results
well
now
i
only
get
sick
about
once
every
weeks
and
it
is
still
bile
related
but
in
addition
i
had
begun
to
feel
movement
near
my
upper
right
abdomen
just
below
the
right
breast
usually
when
i
was
lying
on
my
right
side
it
began
to
get
worse
though
because
it
started
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
position
i
was
in
next
i
noticed
that
when
i
ate
greasy
or
fatty
foods
i
felt
like
my
entire
abdomen
had
turned
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
worse
however
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
something
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able
to
eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low
fat
foods
but
doc
wants
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
this
means
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this
anyway
no
nuts
fried
food
cheese
etc
i
am
allowed
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anything
sweet
eg
bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
im
not
taking
in
fat
is
she
expecting
the
baby
will
take
it
from
my
stores
and
why
this
restriction
on
carbohydrates
if
shes
concerned
about
fat
im
not
clear
how
much
of
her
recommendation
is
based
on
my
weight
gain
and
how
much
on
cholistatis
which
i
cant
seem
to
find
any
information
on
she
originally
said
that
i
should
only
gain
pounds
during
the
entire
pregnancy
since
i
was
about
lbs
overweight
when
i
started
but
my
sister
gained
lbs
during
her
pregnancy
and
shes
taken
it
all
off
and
hasnt
had
any
problems
she
also
asked
if
any
members
of
my
family
were
obese
which
none
of
them
are
anyway
i
think
she
is
overly
concerned
about
weight
gain
and
feel
like
im
being
punished
by
a
severe
diet
she
did
want
to
see
me
again
in
one
week
so
i
think
she
the
diet
may
be
temporary
for
that
one
week
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
reasonable
is
this
nonfat
diet
i
would
understand
if
she
had
said
lowfat
diet
since
im
trying
that
anyway
even
if
she
said
really
lowfat
diet
i
think
she
assumes
i
must
be
eating
a
highfat
diet
but
really
it
is
that
because
of
the
endometriosis
and
the
operation
im
not
able
to
use
the
energy
from
the
food
i
do
eat
any
opinions
info
and
experiences
will
be
appreciated
im
truly
going
stark
raving
mad
trying
to
meet
this
new
strict
diet
because
fruits
and
vegetables
go
through
my
system
in
a
few
minutes
and
ill
end
up
having
to
eat
constantly
thus
far
i
dont
find
any
foods
satisfying
thanks
g
for
one
week
she
probably
wants
to
see
how
you
react
to
the
diet
if
it
changes
anything
you
can
live
on
the
diet
but
you
need
to
up
your
calories
where
before
you
had
a
pat
of
butter
now
you
need
a
medium
apple
probably
microwave
cooked
smaller
meals
but
more
of
them
not
terrific
amounts
of
meat
its
hard
to
digest
anyway
for
comfort
and
to
make
the
carbohydrate
meal
last
longer
eat
pasta
or
rice
which
give
their
calories
up
slowly
rather
than
bread
or
corn
maybe
smaller
meals
as
you
may
be
getting
less
room
in
the
stomach
area
is
the
baby
still
coming
up
is
it
starting
to
push
or
rub
under
your
ribs
how
tight
are
your
clothes
you
shouldnt
be
wearing
any
clothing
that
compresses
your
middle
be
sure
not
to
suck
in
your
stomach
when
sitting
again
it
will
put
pressure
on
the
digestive
tract
try
laying
on
your
sides
back
and
stay
in
reclining
positions
for
the
many
hours
you
are
being
inactive
easier
on
your
legs
circulation
as
well
you
might
try
letting
the
baby
turn
or
at
least
not
be
forced
under
the
ribs
during
the
last
months
when
you
are
shortwaisted
its
easy
for
that
baby
to
end
up
right
under
the
diaphram
especially
if
you
have
tight
abdominal
muscles
if
i
had
my
second
one
to
do
over
again
i
think
id
have
tried
to
loosen
up
since
he
didnt
turn
sideways
until
late
and
the
relief
was
enormous
maybe
this
doctor
does
have
a
thing
about
weight
gain
in
pregnancy
or
maybe
she
just
nags
all
her
patients
this
way
especially
if
shes
young
but
this
gallbladderwhatever
problem
that
might
be
coming
up
is
something
to
be
avoided
if
possible
nausea
etc
can
vary
from
person
to
person
and
with
each
pregnancy
my
first
pregnancy
was
miserable
during
the
second
i
had
very
little
trouble
some
articles
have
said
that
women
with
nausea
had
a
statistically
better
chance
of
carrying
their
baby
grain
of
salt
here
good
luck
