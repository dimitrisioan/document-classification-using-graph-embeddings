can
someone
tell
me
whether
or
not
any
of
the
following
medications
has
been
linked
to
rapidexcessive
weight
gain
andor

hismanal
azmacort
a
topical
steroid
to
prevent
asthma
vancenase
hismanal
astemizole
is
most
definitely
linked
to
weight
gain
it
really
is
peculiar
that
some
antihistamines
have
this
effect
and
even
more
so
an
antihistamine
like
astemizole
which
purportedly
doesnt
cross
the
bloodbrain
barrier
and
so
tends
not
to
cause
drowsiness
so
antihistamines
can
cause
weight
gain
now
they
tell
me
is
there
any
way
to
find
out
which
do
which
dont
my
doctor
obviously
is
asleep
at
the
wheel
the
original
poster
mentioned
fatigue
i
had
that
too
but
it
was
mostly
due
to
the
really
bizarre
dreams
i
was
having
i
wasnt
getting
any
rest
my
doctor
said
that
was
a
common
reaction
if
astemizole
doesnt
cross
the
bloodbrain
barrier
how
does
it
cause
that
side
effect
any
ideas
