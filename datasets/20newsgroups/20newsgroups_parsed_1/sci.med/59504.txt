re
candidayeast
bloom
fact
or
fiction
in
a
previous
article
says
least
a
few
enlightened
physicians
practicing
in
the
us
its
really
too
bad
that
most
us
medical
schools
dont
cover
nutrition
because
if
they
did
candida
would
not
be
viewed
as
a
nondisease
by
so
many
in
the
medical
profession
case
western
reserve
med
school
teaches
nutrition
in
its
own
section
as
well
as
covering
it
in
other
sections
as
they
apply
ie
b
deficiency
in
neuro
as
a
cause
of
neuropathy
b
deficiency
in
hematology
as
a
cause
of
megaloblastic
anemia
yet
i
sill
hold
the
viewpoint
of
mainstream
medicine
candida
can
cause
mucocutaneous
candidiasis
and
in
already
very
sick
patients
with
damaged
immune
systems
like
aids
and
cancer
patients
systemic
candida
infection
i
think
the
yeast
connection
is
a
bunch
of
hooey
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
how
well
nutrition
is
taught
anyway
here
is
a
brief
primer
on
yeast
yeast
infections
as
they
are
commonly
called
are
not
truely
caused
by
yeasts
the
most
common
organism
responsible
for
this
type
of
infection
is
candida
albicans
or
monilia
which
is
actually
a
yeastlike
fungus
well
maybe
im
getting
picky
but
i
always
thought
that
a
yeast
was
one
form
that
a
fungus
could
exist
in
the
other
being
the
mold
form
many
fungi
can
occur
as
either
yeasts
or
molds
depending
on
environment
candida
exibits
what
is
known
as
reverse
dimorphism
it
exists
as
a
mold
in
the
tissues
but
exists
as
a
yeast
in
the
environment
should
we
maybe
call
it
a
mold
infection
a
fungus
infection
maybe
we
should
say
it
is
caused
by
a
moldlike
fungus

a
form
