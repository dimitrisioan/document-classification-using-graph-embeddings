hi
my
wife
has
aquired
some
thyroidal
sp
deficiency
over
the
past
year
that
gives
symptoms
such
as
needing
much
sleep
coldness
and
proneness
to
gaining
weight
she
has
been
to
a
doctor
and
taken
the
ordinary
tests
and
her
values
were
regarded
as
low
the
doctor
and
my
wife
are
not
very
interested
in
starting
medication
as
this
deactivates
the
gland
giving
lifelong
dependency
to
the
drug
hormone
my
questions
are
has
anyone
hadheard
of
success
in
using
this
approach
her
values
have
been
slowly
but
steadily
sinking
any
comment
on
the
probability
of
improvement
although
the
doctor
has
told
her
to
eat
normally
my
wife
has
dieted
vigorously
to
keep
her
weight
as
she
feels
that
is
part
of
keeping
an
edge
over
the
illnesscondition
may
this
affect
the
treatment
development
there
are
several
different
types
of
thyroid
diseases
which
would
cause
a
hypothyroid
condition
reduction
in
the
output
of
the
thyroid
mainly
thyroxin
except
for
ones
caused
by
infections
the
treatment
is
generally
thyroxin
pills
hypothyroid
conditions
caused
by
infections
usually
disappear
when
the
infection
doesthis
doesnt
sound
like
the
case
with
your
wife
thyroxin
orally
does
shut
down
the
thyroid
through
a
feedback
loop
involving
the
pituitary
i
believe
the
pituitary
thinks
that
the
correct
amount
of
thyroxin
is
being
produced
so
it
doesnt
have
to
tell
the
thyroid
to
produce
more
this
process
is
reversable
i
have
hashimotos
thyroiditis
an
autoimmune
condition
and
was
on
thyroxin
for
approx
mo
when
my
endocrinologist
suggested
i
not
take
the
pills
for
wks
when
i
was
retested
for
thyroxin
levels
they
were
normal
i
still
get
tested
every
mo
because
the
condition
might
reappear
the
pills
are
safe
and
have
very
few
sideaffects
those
mostly
at
beginning
of
treatment
having
a
baby
might
be
a
problem
and
would
at
least
require
closer
monitoring
of
hormone
levels
thyroxin
controls
energy
production
which
explains
sleepiness
coldness
and
weight
gain
there
is
also
water
retention
possibly
around
heart
changes
in
vision
and
coarser
hair
and
skin
among
other
things
i
am
not
a
doctor
so
im
sure
i
mistated
something
but
the
important
thing
is
that
thyroid
problems
are
usually
easily
corrected
and
if
they
arent
corrected
can
cause
problems
in
the
rest
of
the
body
get
a
second
opinion
from
a
good
endocrinologist
and
have
himher
explain
things
in
detail
to
you
and
your
wife
