for
being
treated
by
a
liscenced
physician
for
a
disease
that
did
not
exist
calling
this
physician
a
quack
was
reprehensible

and
i
see
that
you
and
some
of
the
others
are
doing
it
here
as
well
do
you
believe
that
any
quacks
exist
how
about
quack
diagnoses
is
being
a
licensed
physician
enough
to
guarantee
that
someone
is
not
a
quack
or
is
it
just
that
even
if
a
licensed
physician
is
a
quack
other
people
shouldnt
say
so
can
you
give
an
example
of
a
commonly
diagnosed
ailment
that
you
think
is
a
quack
diagnosis
or
have
we
gotten
to
the
point
in
civilization
where
we
no
longer
need
to
worry
about
unscrupulous
healers
taking
advantage
of
people
