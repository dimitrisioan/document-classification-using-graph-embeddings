i
think
thats
the
correct
spelling
the
proper
spelling
is
kirlian
it
was
an
effect
discoverd
by
s
kirlian
a
soviet
film
developer
in
as
i
recall
the
coronas
visible
are
ascribed
to
static
discharges
and
chemical
reactions
between
the
organic
material
and
the
silver

i
think
thats
the
correct
spelling
i
am
looking
for
any
informationsupplies
that
will
allow
doityourselfers
to
take
krillean
pictures
im
thinking
that
education
suppliers
for
schools
might
have
a
appartus
for
sale
but
i
dont
know
any
of
the
companies
any
info
is
greatly
appreciated
in
case
you
dont
know
krillean
photography
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
involves
taking
pictures
of
an
most
of
the
time
organic
object
between
charged
plates
the
picture
will
show
energy
patterns
or
spikes
around
the
object
photographed
and
depending
on
what
type
of
object
it
is
the
spikes
or
energy
patterns
will
vary
one
might
extrapolate
here
and
say
that
this
proves
that
every
object
within
the
universe
as
we
know
it
has
its
own
energy
signature
to
construct
a
kirlian
device
find
a
copy
of
handbook
of
psychic
discoveries
by
sheila
ostrander
and
lynn
schroeder
library
of
congress
it
describes
the
necessary
equipment
and
suppliers
for
the
tesla
coil
or
alternatives
the
copper
plate
and
setup
i
used
a
pack
of
sx
film
and
removed
a
single
pack
in
a
dark
room
then
made
the
exposure
put
it
back
in
the
film
pack
and
ran
it
out
through
the
rollers
of
the
camera
forinstant
developing
and
very
high
quality
it
is
a
good
way
to
experience
what
kirlian
photography
is
really
and
what
it
is
not
as
you
know
all
ready
it
is
the
pattern
in
the
bioplasmic
energy
fieldthat
is
significant
variations
caused
by
exposure
time
distance
from
