youre
rude
medicine
is
not
a
totallly
scientific
endevour
its
often
practiced
in
a
disorganized
manner
most
early
treatment
of
nonlife
threatening
illness
is
done
on
a
guess
hazarded
after
anecdotal
evidence
given
by
the
patient
its
an
educated
guess
by
a
trained
person
but
its
still
no
more
than
a
guess
its
cheaper
and
simpler
to
medicate
first
and
only
deal
further
with
those
people
who
dont
respond
dyer
is
beyond
rude
there
have
been
and
always
will
be
people
who
are
blinded
by
their
own
knowledge
and
unopen
to
anything
that
isnt
already
established
given
what
the
medical
community
doesnt
know
im
surprised
that
he
has
this
outlook
for
the
record
i
have
had
several
outbreaks
of
thrush
during
the
several
past
few
years
with
no
indication
of
immunosuppression
or
nutritional
deficiencies
i
had
not
taken
any
antobiotics
my
dentist
who
sees
a
fair
amount
of
thrush
recommended
acidophilous
after
i
began
taking
acidophilous
on
a
daily
basis
the
outbreaks
ceased
when
i
quit
taking
the
acidophilous
the
outbreaks
periodically
resumed
i
resumed
taking
the
acidophilous
with
no
further
outbreaks
since
then
