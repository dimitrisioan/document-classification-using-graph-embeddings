and
migraine

the
other
day
i
played
tennis
during
my
lunch
hour
im
out
of
tennis
shape
so
it
was
very
intense
exercise
i
got
overheated
and
dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my
head
then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in
the
afternoon
i
took
cafergot
but
it
didnt
help
and
the
pain
started
although
it
wasnt
as
intense
as
it
usually
is
and
about
pm
that
night
the
pain
subsided
this
isnt
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
im
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
im
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
dont
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this
hi
janet
sounds
exactly
like
mine
same
circumstance
same
onset
symptoms
same
cafergot
uselessness
same
duration
in
fact
of
all
the
people
i
know
who
have
migraines
none
have
been
so
similar
there
is
such
a
wide
variation
between
people
with
respect
to
what
causes
their
headaches
that
i
generally
dont
bother
sharing
what
ive
learned
about
mine
but
since
ours
seem
to
be
alike
here
are
my
observations
i
dont
think
its
heat
per
se
ive
had
more
in
winter
than
summer
dehydration
could
conceivably
figure
though
try
tanking
up
before
playing
rather
than
after
being
in
shape
doesnt
seem
to
help
me
much
either
ive
identified
four
factors
that
do
make
a
difference
listed
in
descending
order
of
importance
heavy
exercise
sleep
deprivation
fasting
eg
skipped
breakfast
physical
trauma
eg
head
bonk
heavy
exercise
has
preceded
all
of
my
postadolescent
migraines
but
i
dont
get
migraines
after
every
heavy
exercise
session
one
or
more
of
the
other
factors
must
be
present
usually
since
i
discovered
this
ive
been
nearly
migrainefree
relapsing
only
once
every
two
or
three
years
when
i
get
cocky
its
been
so
long
maybe
i
just
dont
get
them
anymore
and
stop
being
careful
hope
this
is
helpful
