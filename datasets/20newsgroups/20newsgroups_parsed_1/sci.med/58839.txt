i
have
had
a
sore
throat
for
almost
a
week
when
i
look
into
the
mirror
with
the
aid
of
a
flash
light
i
see
white
plaques
in
the
very
back
of
my
throat
on
the
sides
i
went
to
a
health
center
to
have
a
throat
culture
taken
they
said
that
i
do
not
have
strep
throat
could
a
viral
infection
cause
white
plaques
on
the
sides
of
my
throat
first
i
am
not
a
doctor
i
know
about
this
because
i
have
been
through
it
it
sounds
like
tonsilitis
lit
swollen
tonsils
feel
under
your
jaw
hinge
for
a
swelling
on
each
side
if
you
find
them
its
tonsilitis
ive
had
this
a
couple
of
times
in
the
past
the
doctor
prescribed
a
weeks
course
of
penicillin
and
that
cleared
it
up
in
my
case
it
was
associated
with
glandular
fever
which
is
a
viral
infection
which
from
my
point
of
view
resembled
flu
and
tonsilitis
that
kept
coming
back
for
a
year
or
so
there
is
a
blood
test
for
this
in
conclusion
see
a
doctor
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
