choleric
and
the
great
ntnf
semantic
war
crossposted
from
altpsychologypersonality
since
it
talks
about
physicians
personalities
apologies
to
scimed
readers
not
familiar
with
the
myersbriggs
ntnf
personality
terms
but
in
a
word
or
two
the
nts
intuitivethinkers
are
approximately
your
philosophysciencetech
pragmatic
types
and
the
nfs
intuitivefeelers
are
your
humanitiessocialsciencetheology
idealistic
types
they
hate
each
others
guts
but
tend
to
intermarry
the

j
is
a

physicians
are
just
responding

hcs
it
is
fascinating
that
a
disproportionate
number
of
physicians
will
type
out
as
nt
one
driving
characteristic
of
an
nt
especially
an
ntj
is
their
obvious
choleric
behavior
driver
type
a
etc
the
extreme
emotional
need

be
the

competent
please
get

right
jon
this
ntj
has
a
strong
desire
to
correct
semantic
mistakes
because
the
nfs
of
this
world
are
fouling
the
oncepristine
nt
intellectual
nest
with
their
verbal
poop
the
dominant
correlation
is
nt
phlegmatic
and
not
nt
choleric
one
of
the
semantic
roots
of
choleric
is
the
idea
of
hot
emotional
and
one
of
the
semantic
roots
of
phlegmatic
is
cold
unemotional
here
is
a
thumbnail
sketch
taken
from

eysenck
refering

relating
the
ancient
greek
quadratic
typology
with
modern
terms

i
suspect
that
your
characterisation
of
nts
as
choleric
is
what
you
psychtypes
call
a
projection
of
your
own
nfness
onto
us
maybe
we
need
more
nf
doctors
perhaps
in
serious
pediatics
and
my
little
boys
got
a
runny
nose
doctor
general
practice
but
please
god
not
in
neurology
opthamology
urology
etc
etc
and
nfpsychiatry
should
seperate
from
ntie
real
psychiatry
and
be
given
a
new
name
something
