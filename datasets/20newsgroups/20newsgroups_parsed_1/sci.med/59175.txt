re
opinions
on
allergy
hay
fever
shots
i
had
allergy
shots
for
about
four
years
starting
as
a
sophomore
in
high
school
before
that
i
used
to
get
bloody
noses
nighttime
asthma
attacks
and
eyes
so
itchy
i
couldnt
get
to
sleep
after
about
months
on
the
shots
most
of
those
symptoms
were
gone
and
they
havent
come
back
i
stopped
getting
the
shots
due
more
to
laziness
than
planning
in
college
my
allergies
got
a
little
worse
after
that
but
are
still
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
they
used
to
be
so
yes
the
shots
do
work
