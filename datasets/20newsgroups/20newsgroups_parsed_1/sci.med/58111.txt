a
friend
of
mine
has
a
trouble
with
her
ears
ringing
etc
a
folks
do
we
have
an
faq
on
tinnitus
yet
b
as
a
loooong
time
sufferer
of
tinnitus
and
as
a
neuroscientist
who
has
looked
over
the
literature
carefully
i
believe
the
following
are
reasonable
conclusions
millions
of
people
suffer
from
chronic
tinnitus
the
cause
it
not
understood
there
is
no
accepted
treatment
that
cures
it
some
experimental
treatments
may
have
helped
some
people
a
bit
but
there
have
be
no
reportseven
anecdotalof
massive
good
results
with
any
of
these
experimental
drugs
some
people
with
chronic
loud
tinnitus
use
noise
blocking
to
get
to
sleep
sudden
onset
loud
tinnitus
can
be
caused
by
injuries
and
sometimes
abates
or
goes
away
after
a
few
months
aspirin
is
well
known
to
exacerbate
tinnitus
in
some
people
there
is
a
national
association
of
tinnitus
sufferers
in
the
us
one
usually
gets
used
to
it
especially
when
concentrating
on
something
else
the
tinnitus
becomes
unnoticed
stress
and
lack
of
sleep
make
tinnitus
more
annoying
sometimes
im
sure
those
of
us
who
have
it
wish
there
was
a
cure
but
there
is
not
