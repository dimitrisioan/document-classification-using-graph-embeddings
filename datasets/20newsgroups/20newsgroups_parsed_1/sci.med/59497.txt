reading
through
the
posts
about
kirlian
whatever
spelling
photography
i
couldnt
help
but
being
slightly
disgusted
by
the
narrowminded
i
know
it
all
i
dont
believe
what
i
cant
see
or
measure
attitude
of
many
people
out
there
i
am
neither
a
real
believer
nor
a
disbeliever
when
it
comes
to
socalled
paranormal
stuff
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
is
just
as
likely
as
the
existence
of
for
instance
a
god
which
seems
to
be
quite
accepted
in
our
societies
without
any
scientific
basis
accepted
by
whom
people
who
think
digital
watches
are
a
real
good
idea
that
channels
of
television
is
x
better
than
channels
of
television
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
a
serious
mistake
to
close
your
mind
to
something
anything
simply
because
it
doesnt
fit
your
current
frame
of
reference
history
shows
that
many
great
people
great
scientists
were
people
who
kept
an
open
mind
and
were
ridiculed
by
sceptics
youre
right
keep
an
open
mind
to
the
following
taco
flavored
donuts
cannibalism
good
way
to
get
that
extra
protein
in
the
diet
belief
in
yawanga
armadillo
god
of
parking
meters
mark
vandewettering
truest
servant
of
yawanga
oh
yawanga
he
who
never
will
become
a
roadpizza
all
of
my
quarters
and
dimes
nay
even
nickels
will
be
spent
to
buy
time
to
park
in
your
eternal
parking
lot
