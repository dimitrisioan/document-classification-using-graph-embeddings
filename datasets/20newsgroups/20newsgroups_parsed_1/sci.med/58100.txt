i
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
any
new
information
out
there
about
the
subject
or
any
new
studies
being
conducted
i
am
confident
in
my
pediatrician
and
her
communication
with
the
people
in
chapel
hill
but
since
this
is
a
lifelong
disorder
and
genetically
transferred
i
would
like
keep
current
i
do
realize
that
since
this
is
a
relatively
new
disorder
first
documented
in
in
a
fertility
clinic
in
scandanavia
and
is
therefore
controversial
i
do
not
know
a
lot
about
this
except
from
seeing
one
patient
with
kartageners
syndrome
which
is
a
form
of
immotile
cilia
syndrome
in
which
there
is
situs
inversus
bronchiectasis
and
chronic
infections
situs
inversus
means
that
organs
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
body
and
can
be
complete
or
partial
it
is
interesting
medically
because
the
normal
location
of
organs
is
caused
in
part
by
the
normal
rotation
associated
with
ciliary
motion
so
that
in
absence
of
this
laterality
can
be
random
people
with
situs
inversus
are
quite
popular
at
medical
schools
because
of
their
rarity
and
the
fact
that
most
doctors
get
a
bit
upset
when
they
cant
find
the
patients
heart
sounds
because
theyre
on
the
wrong
side
according
to
harrisons
immotile
cilia
syndrom
is
an
autosomal
recessive
which
should
imply
that
on
average
one
child
in
four
in
a
family
would
be
affected
but
there
may
be
much
more
current
information
on
this
and
as
usual
in
medicine
we
may
be
talking
about
more
than
one
conditiion
i
would
suggest
that
you
ask
your
pediatrician
about
contacting
a
medical
geneticics
specialist
of
which
there
is
probably
one
at
ncsu
km
