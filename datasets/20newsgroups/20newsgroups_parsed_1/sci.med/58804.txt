heres
a
potentially
stupid
question
to
possibly
the
wrong
news
group
but
can
men
get
yeast
infections
spread
them
what
kind
of
symptoms
similar
as
womens
i
have
a
yeast
infection
and
my
husband
who
is
a
natural
paranoid
on
a
good
day
is
sure
hes
gon
na
catch
it
and
keeps
asking
me
what
its
like
im
not
sure
what
his
symptoms
would
be
the
answer
is
yes
and
no
im
sure
others
on
scimed
can
expand
on
this
jon
i
know
from
personal
experience
that
men
can
get
yeast
infections
i
get
rather
nasty
ones
from
time
to
time
mostly
in
the
area
of
the
scrotum
and
the
base
of
the
penis
theyre
nowhere
near
as
dangerous
for
me
as
for
many
women
but
goddamn
does
it
hurt
in
the
summertime
even
in
the
wintertime
when
i
sweat
i
get
really
uncomfy
down
there
the
best
thing
i
can
do
to
keep
it
under
control
is
keep
my
weight
down
and
keep
cool
down
there
shorts
in
degree
weather
that
kind
of
thing
and
of
course
some
occasional
sun
lost
boy
