re
centi
and
milli
pedes
i
remember
as
a
kid
visiting
my
relatives
on
kauai
and
one
of
the
things
that
really
frightened
me
was
centipedes
id
been
told
they
were
poisonous
and
infrequently
one
would
pop
up
and
scare
the
heck
out
of
me
once
one
came
out
of
the
vacuum
cleaner
and
it
seemed
like
it
was
at
least
a
foot
long
and
moving
at
miles
an
hour
