what
is
the
healthiest
way
to
deal
with
earwax
should
one
just
leave
it
in
your
ear
and
not
mess
with
it
or
should
you
clean
it
out
every
so
often
can
cleaning
it
out
damage
your
eardrums
are
there
any
tubes
in
your
ear
that
might
get
blocked
assuming
that
the
wax
is
causing
hearing
loss
congestion
or
popping
in
the
ears
you
can
try
some
cautious
tepid
water
irrigation
with
a
bulb
syringe
but
it
is
awkward
to
do
for
oneself
and
may
not
work
or
may
even
make
things
worse
my
wife
would
disagree
she
does
it
successfully
every
six
months
or
so
in
any
case
do
not
attempt
anything
with
qtips
my
experience
has
been
that
this
is
initially
best
handled
by
a
earnosethroat
person
i
say
initially
because
an
ent
can
evaluate
whether
or
not
you
might
have
success
on
your
own
with
a
little
instruction
i
am
not
a
physician
obviously
because
i
eschew
the
term
otolaryngologist
this
posting
is

only
