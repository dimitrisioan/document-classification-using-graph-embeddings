there
are
observable
changes
which
take
place
that
whenever
they
occur
can
be
identified

any

prostate
ca
is
an
especially
troublesome
entity
for
chiropractors
it
so
typically
causes
bone
pain
due
to
spinal
metastases
that
it
gets
manipulated
frequently
manipulating
a
cancer
riddled
bone
is
highly
dangerous
since
it
can
then
fracture
ive
seen
at
least
three
cases
where
this
happened
with
resulting
neurologic
damage
including
paraplegia
this
is
one
instance
where
knowing
how
to
read
xrays
can
really
help
a
chiropractor
stay
out
of
trouble
do
chiropractors
know
what
bony
