writes
if
it
were
my
wife
i
would
insist
that
a
radiologist
be
involved
in
the
process
radiologist
are
intensively
trained
in
the
process
of
interpreting
diagnostic
imaging
data
and
are
aware
of
many
things
that
other
physicians
arent
aware
of
maybe
maybe
not
a
new
graduate
would
obviously
be
well
trained
but
perhaps
without
sufficient
experience
a
radiologist
trained
or
years
ago
who
has
not
kept
his
continuing
education
current
is
a
whole
nuther
matter
a
ob
who
has
trained
in
modern
radiology
technology
is
certainly
more
qualified
than
the
latter
and
at
least
equal
to
the
former
would
you
want
a
radiologist
to
deliver
your
baby
if
you
wouldnt
then
why
would
you
want
a
obgyn
to
read
your
ultrasound
study
if
the
radiologist
is
also
trained
in
obgyn
why
not
