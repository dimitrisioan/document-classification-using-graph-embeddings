re
is
msg
sensitivity
superstition
in
article
opirg
writes
many
people
responded
with
more
anecdotal
stories
i
think
its
safe
to
say
the
original
poster
is
already
familiar
with
such
stories
presumably
he
wants
hard
info
to
substantiate
or
refute
claims
about
msg
making
people
ill
there
has
been
no
hard
info
provided
about
msg
making
people
ill
thats
the
point
after
all
like
youself
someone
who
can
read
a
scientific
paper
and
apparently
come
away
from
it
with
bizarrely
cracked
ideas
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
this
substance
in
human
nutrition
have
you
read
olneys
work
i
fail
to
see
how
citing
results
from
peerreviewed
studies
qualifies
as
bizarrely
cracked
thats
because
these
peerreviewed
studies
are
not
addressing
the
effects
of
msg
in
people
theyre
looking
at
animal
models
you
cant
walk
away
from
this
and
start
ranting
about
gloom
and
doom
as
if
there
were
any
documented
deleterious
health
effects
demonstrated
in
humans
note
that
i
wouldnt
have
any
argument
with
a
statement
like
noting
that
animal
administration
has
pro
duced
the
following
blah
blah
we
must
be
careful
about
its
use
in
humans
this
is
precisely
not
what
you
said
tests
have
been
done
on
rhesus
monkeys
as
well
i
have
never
seen
a
study
where
the
mode
of
administration
was
intraventricular
the
glu
and
asp
were
administered
orally
some
studies
used
iv
and
sc
intraventricular
is
not
a
normal
admin
method
for
food
tox
studies
for
obvious
reasons
you
must
not
have
read
the
peerreviewed
works
that
i
referred
to
or
you
would
never
have
come
up
with
this
brain
injection
bunk
it
most
certainly
is
for
neurotoxicology
you
know
studies
of
glutamate
involve
more
than
food
science
pardon
me
but
where
are
you
getting
this
from
have
you
read
the
journals
have
you
done
a
thorough
literature
search
so
point
us
to
the
studies
in
humans
please
im
familiar
with
the
literature
and
ive
never
seen
any
which
relate
at
all
to
olneys
work
in
animals
and
the
effects
of
glutamate
on
neurons
the
point
is
exceeding
the
window
of
course
theyre
amino
acids
note
that
people
with
pku
can
not
tolerate
any
phenylalanine
well
actually
they
have
to
tolerate
some
phenylalanine
its
a
essential
amino
acid
they
just
try
to
get
as
little
as
is
healthy
without
producing
dangerous
levels
of
phenylalanine
and
its
metabolites
in
the
blood
olneys
research
compared
infant
human
diets
specifically
the
amount
of
freely
available
glu
in
mothers
milk
versus
commercial
baby
foods
vs
typical
lunch
items
from
the
standard
american
diet
such
as
packaged
soup
mixes
he
found
that
one
could
exceed
the
projected
safety
margin
for
infant
humans
by
at
least
fourfold
in
a
single
meal
of
processed
foods
mothers
milk
was
well
below
the
effective
dose
goodness
im
not
saying
that
its
good
to
feed
infants
a
lot
of
glutamatesupplemented
foods
its
just
that
this
projected
safety
margin
is
a
construct
derived
from
animal
models
and
given
that
you
can
prove
anything
you
like
were
talking
prudent
policy
in
infant
nutrition
here
yet
youre
misrepresenting
it
as
received
wisdom
read
olneys
review
paper
in
prog
brain
res
and
check
his
sources
they
are
impecable
there
is
no
dispute
impeccable
there
most
certainly
is
a
dispute
between
who
over
what
i
would
be
most
interested
in
seeing
you
provide
peerreviewed
nonfoodindustryfunded
citations
to
articles
disputing
that
msg
has
no
effects
whatsoever
you
mean
asserting
youre
being
intellectually
dishonest
or
just
plain
confused
because
youre
conflating
reports
which
do
not
necessarily
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
olneys
reports
would
argue
a
potential
for
problems
in
human
infants
but
thats
not
to
say
that
this
says
anything
whatsoever
about
the
use
of
msg
in
most
foods
nor
does
he
provide
any
studies
in
humans
which
indicate
any
deleterious
effects
for
obvious
reasons
it
says
nothing
about
msgs
contribtion
to
the
phenomenon
of
the
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
it
says
nothing
about
the
frequent
inability
to
replicate
anecdotal
reports
of
msg
sensitivity
in
the
lab
hmm
com
why
am
i
not
surprised
dianne
murray
probably
one
of
the
dumber
remarks
youve
made
