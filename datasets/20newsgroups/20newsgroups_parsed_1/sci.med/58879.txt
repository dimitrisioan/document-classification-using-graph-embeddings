lasers
for
dermatologists
having
had
limited
tinea
pedis
for
more
than
years
and
finding
it
resistant
to
all
creams
and
powders
i
have
tried
i
wonder
why
dermatologists
do
not
use
lasers
to
destroy
the
fungus
it
would
seem
likely
to
be
effective
and
inexpensive
are
there
good
reasons
for
not
using
lasers
i
was
told
that
dermatology
had
not
yet
reached
the
laser
age
