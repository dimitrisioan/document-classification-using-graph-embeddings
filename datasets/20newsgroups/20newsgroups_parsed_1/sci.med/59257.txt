annual
inguinal
hernia
repair
last
year
i
was
totally
surprised
when
my
annual
physical
disclosed
an
inguinal
hernia
i
couldnt
remember
doing
anything
that
would
have
caused
it
that
is
i
hadnt
been
lifting
more
than
other
people
do
and
in
fact
probably
somewhat
less
eventually
the
thing
became
more
painful
and
i
had
the
repair
operation
this
year
i
developed
a
pain
on
the
other
side
this
turned
out
to
be
another
inguinal
hernia
so
i
go
back
to
the
hospital
monday
for
another
fun
operation
i
dont
know
of
anything
im
doing
to
cause
this
to
happen
im
years
old
and
i
dont
think
im
old
enough
for
things
to
start
falling
apart
like
this
the
surgeon
who
is
doing
the
operation
seems
to
suspect
a
congenital
weakness
but
if
so
why
did
it
suddenly
appear
when
i
was
and
not
really
as
active
as
i
was
when
i
was
younger
does
anyone
know
how
to
prevent
a
hernia
other
than
not
lifting
anything
its
rare
that
i
lift
more
than
my
monthold
or
a
sack
full
of
groceries
and
you
may
have
noticed
that
your
typical
grocery
sack
is
fairly
small
these
days
is
there
some
sort
of
exercise
that
will
reduce
the
risk
of
course
my
wife
thinks
its
from
sitting
for
long
periods
of
time
at
the
computer
