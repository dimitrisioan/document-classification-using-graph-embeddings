the
difference
between
a
nobel
prize
level
scientist
and
a
mediocre
scientist
does
not
lie
in
the
quality
of
their
empirical
methodology
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their
thinking
lee
lady
is
correct
when
she
asserts
that
the
difference
between
einstein
and
the
average
postdoc
physicist
is
the
quality
of
their
thought
but
what
is
the
difference
between
einstein
and
a
genius
who
would
be
a
great
scientist
but
whose
great
thoughts
are
scientifically
screwy
this
example
is
probably
wrong
there
is
the
case
of
one
famous
physicist
telling
another
that
he
was
probably
wrong
as
i
recall
the
quote
your
ideas
are
crazy
to
be
sure
but
they
are
not
crazy
enough
to
be
right
the
typical
screwball
is
only
somewhat
screwy
