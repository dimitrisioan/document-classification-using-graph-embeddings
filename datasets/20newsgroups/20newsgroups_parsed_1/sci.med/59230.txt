to
have
an
authentic
surefire
way
of
making
this
great
sauce
that
is
used
to
adorn
gyros
and
souvlaki
im
not
sure
of
the
exact
recipe
but
im
sure
acidophilus
is
one
of
the
major
ingredients
its
plain
yoghurt
with
grated
cucumber
and
coriander
other
spices
are
sometimes
used
some
people
use
half
yoghurt
and
half
mayonaise
