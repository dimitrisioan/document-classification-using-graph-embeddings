the

today
announced
the
approval
of
depo
provera
an
injectable
contraceptive
drug
the
drug
which
contains
a
synthetic
hormone
similar
to
the
natural
hormone
progesterone
protects
women
from
pregnancy
for
three
months
per
injection
the
hormone
is
injected
into
the
muscle
of
the
arm
or
buttock
where
it
is
released
into
the
bloodstream
to
prevent
pregnancy
it
is
more
than

effective
this
drug
presents
another
longterm
effective
option
for
women
to
prevent

as
an
injectable
given
once

three
months
depo
provera
eliminates
problems
related
to
missing
a
daily

depo
provera
is
available
in
mg
single

vials
from
doctors
and
clinics
and
must
be
given
on
a
regular
basis
to

protection
if

in

some
patients
may
experience
headache

monica

the
food

administration
today
announced
that
it
will
soon
publish
new
rules
to
shed
the
approval
of
drugs
for
patients
with
serious
or
life
threatening
illnesses
such
as
aids
cancer
and
alzheimers
disease
these
final
rules
will
help
patients
who
are
suffering
the
most
serious
illnesses
to
get
access
to
new
drugs
months
or
even
years
earlier
than
would
otherwise
be
possible
said
hhs
secretary
louis
w
sullivan
md
the
effort
to
accelerate
fda
review
for
these
drugs
has
been
a
longterm
commitment
and
indeed
a
hallmark
of
this
administration
these
rules
establish
procedures
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
approve
a
drug
based
on
surrogate
endpoints
or
markers
they
apply
when
the
drug
provides
a
meaningful
benefit
over
currently
available
therapies
such
endpoints
would
include
laboratory
tests
or
physical
signs
that
do
not
in
themselves
constitute
a
clinical
effect
but
that
are
judged
by
qualified
scientists
to
be
likely
to
correspond
to
real
benefits
to
the
patient
use
of
surrogate
endpoints
for
measurement
of
drug
efficacy
permits
approval
earlier
than
if
traditional
endpoints
such
as
relief
of
disease
symptoms
or
prevention
of
disability
and
death
from
the
disease
are
used
the
new
rules
provide
for
therapies
to
be
approved
as
soon
as
safety
and
effectiveness
based
on
surrogate
endpoints
can
be
reasonably
established
the
drugs
sponsor
will
be
required
to
agree
to
continue
or
conduct
postmarketing
human
studies
to
confirm
that
the
drugs
effect
on
the
surrogate
endpoint
is
an
indicator
of
its
clinical
effectiveness
one

can
also
be
used
if
necessary
when
fda
determines
that
a
drug
judged
to
be
effective
for
the
treatment
of
a
disease
can
be
used
safely
only
under
a
restricted

the
new

said

of

typical
of
the

before
exposing

to
the

the
standard
curve
relating

demonstrates
a
leveling

for

of
large

changes
in
dietary

andor

in
this
range
have

you

the

almost

of
the

you
are

the
framingham

for

did
not

on

between

all

says
after

the
increase
in
hdl
carries
broad
dietary
implications
for
industrialized
nations
we
think
hdlcholesterol
increased
because
we
increased
the
amount
of
dietary
fat
over
the
fat
content
used
in
the
previous
tarahumara
metabolic
study
in
that
study
we
saw
no
change
in
hdl
levels
after
raising
the
dietary
cholesterol
but
keeping
the
fat
relatively
consistent
with
native
consumption
in
the
present
study
we
increased
fat
intake
to
percent
of
the
total
calories
we
reached
the
conclusion
in
the
tarahumara
study
that
hdl
reflects
the
amount
of
dietary
fat
in
general
and
not
the
amount
of
dietary
cholesterol
hdl
must
increase
to
help
metabolize
the
fat
and
it
increased
quite
a
bit
in
this
study
dr
connor
explains
low
hdl
in
the
tarahumarans
is
not
typically
an
important
predictor
of
coronary
heart
disease
because
they
do
not
normally
consume
large
amounts
of
fat
or
cholesterol
hdl
remains
an
important
predictor
to
americans
because
of
their
usual
high
fat
intake
dr
connor
recommends
a
diet
for
americans
that
contains
less
than
percent
of
total
calories
as
fat
less
than
mg
of
cholesterol
and
a
csi
around
varying
in
accordance
with
caloric
needs
such
a
diet
is
low
in
meat
and
dairy
fat
high
in
fiber
dr
connor
also
comments
on
recent
suggestions
that
americans
adopt
a
mediterraneanstyle
diet
the
original
mediterranean
diet
in
its
pristine
state
consisted
of
a
very
low
intake
of
fat
and
very
few
animal
and
dairy
products
we
are
already
eating
a
lot
of
meat
and
dairy
products
simply
to
continue
that
pattern
while
switching
to
olive
oil
is
not
going
to
help
the
situation
the

health
organization
who
is
focusing
much
attention
on
the
emergence
of
diseases
such
as
coronary
heart
disease
in
nations
and
societies
undergoing
technological
development
dr
connor
says
that
coronary
heart
disease
starts
with
a
given
societys
elite
who
typically
eat
a
different
diet
than
the
average
citizen
if
the
pattern
of
afluence
increases
the
entire
population
will
have
have
a
higher
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
which
places
a
termendous
health
care
burden
on
a
society
who
would
like
the
developing
countries
to
prevent
coronary
heart
disease
so
they
can
concentrate
on
other
aspects
of
their
economic
development
and
on
public
health
measures
to
improve
general
wellbeing
rather
than
paying
for
unnecessary
expensive
medical
technology
dr
connors
says
the
overall
implication
of
this
study
is
that
humans
can
readily
move
their
plasma
lipids
and
lipoprotein
values
into
a
highrisk
range
within
a
very
short
time
by
an
affluent
excessive
diet
the
present
rate
of
coronary
heart
disease
in
the
united
states
is
percent
less
than
it
was
years
ago
so
a
lot
has
been
accomplished
we
are
changing
