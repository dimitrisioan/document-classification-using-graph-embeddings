i
dont
know
if
you
make
a
point
of
keeping
up
with
liver
transplant
research
but
youre
certainly
in
the
right
place
for
these
questions
has
there
been
anything
recent
in
transplant
proceedings
or
somesuch
on
xenografts
how
about
liver
section
transplants
from
living
donors
im
sure
the
pittsburgh
group
has
published
the
baboon
work
but
i
dont
know
where
in
chicago
they
were
doing
lobe
transplants
from
living
donors
and
im
sure
theyve
published
i
dont
read
the
transplant
literature
i
just
see
the
liver
transplant
patients
when
they
get
into
neurologic
trouble
pretty
frequent
so
that
and
the
newspapers
and
scuttlebutt
is
the
way
i
keep
up
with
what
they
are
doing
howard
doyle
works
with
them
and
can
tell
you
more
gordon

njxp
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
