ive
already
heard
from
a
couple
who
said
they
had
it
and
it
didnt
really
help
them
i
am
a

severe
asthmatic
ent
doc
says
large
percentage
see
some
relief
of
their
asthma
after
sinus
surgery
also
he
said
it
is
not
unheard
of
that
migraines
go
away
after
chronis
sinusitis
is
relieved
did
your
ent
also
tell
you
that
this
procedure
may
remove
warts
from
the
soles
of
your
feet
and
improve
your
sex
life
you
probably
were
trying
to
be
facetious
but
just
for
the
record
partial
nasal
obstruction
is
correlated
with
a
number
of
chronic
disorders
such
as
migraine
hyperthyroidism
asthma
peptic
ulcer
dysmenorrhea
and
lack
of
libido
