re

sensitivity

these
are
my

from

lundby
writes
as
a
person
who
is
very
sensitive
to
msg
and
whose
wife
and
kids
are
too
i
want
to
know
why
the
food
industry
wants
to
put
msg
in
food
some
people
think
it
enhances
the
flavor
i
personally
dont
think
it
helps
the
taste
it
makes
me
sick
so
i
try
to
avoid
it

sez
you
such
an
effect
in
humans
has
not
been
demonstrated
in
any
controlled
studies
infant
mice
and
other
models
are
useful
as
far
as
they
go
but
theyre
not
relevant
to
the
matter
at
hand
which
is
not
to
say
that
i
favor
its
use
in
things
like
baby
fooda
patently
ridiculous
use
of
the
additive
but
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
msg
in
the
diet
effects
humans
adversely
well
i
know
that
msg
effects
me
adversely
maybe
not
permanently
but
at
least
temporarily
enough
that
i
like
to
try
to
avoid
the
stuff

if
you
dont
like
additives
then
for
godsake
get
off
the
net
and
learn
to
cook
from
scratch
sheesh
excuse
me
why
cant
people
learn
to
cook
from
scratch
on
the
net
ive
gotten
lots
of
recipes
off
the
net
that
dont
use
additives
if
you
like
additives
then
get
off
the
net
and
go
to
your
local
supermarket
buy
lots
of
packaged
foods
and
you
get
off
the
net
is
it
to
cover
up
the
fact
that
the
recipes
are
not
very
good
or
the
food
is
poor
quality
yes
and
you
buy
it
says
something
about
your
taste
eh
i
dont
and
what
happens
when
the
companies
forced
to
submit
to
your
silly
notions
go
out
of
business
because
nobody
wants
to
buy
their
overpriced
bad
food
removing
preservatives
directly
raises
food
costs
by
reducing
shelf
life
hey
ill
pay
my
hard
earned
dollars
to
buy
food
that
costs
more
but
does
not
have
preservatives
i
choose
to
speak
with
my
pocketbook
in
many
ways
from
kiran
wagle
you
have
a
good
point
msg
is
commonly
used
in
soups
in
bottled
sauces
in
seasoning
mixtures
and
in
the
coating
on
barbecue
potato
chips
nacho
cheese
doritos
breading
for
many
frozen
fried
foods
like
fish
and
chicken
etc
ad
naseum
if
msg
is
really
the
problem
we
should
call
this
barbecue
potato
chip
syndrome
or
maybe
diner
syndrome
or
the
and
other
natural
flavorings
syndrome
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
bought
anything
labelled
with
and
other
natural
flavorings
from
kiran
wagle
the
reaction
came
the
time
the
msg
was
in
the
food
that
was
the
only
difference
same
restaurant
same
ingredients
how
do
you
know
this
in
order
to
demonstrate
your
claim
you
would
have
had
to
supervise
the
preparation
on
both
occasions
perhaps
they
used
msg
both
times
and
lied
about
it
perhaps
once
they
used
something
that
had
begun
to
spoil
and
produced
some
bizarre
toxin
that
youre
allergic
to
well
i
had
had
similar
reactions
many
times
that
was
when
i
really
started
watching
carefully
reaction
to
doritos
hey
guess
whats
in
there
reaction
to
lawrys
season
salt
guess
whats
in
there
ill
give
you
a
hint
ive
had
enough
problems
with
many
many
many
different
products
with
msg
that
i
figured
out
one
thing
unless
i
plan
on
getting
sick
i
wont
eat
the
stuff
without
my
seldane
and
did
i
ever
learn
to
read
labels
please
note
that
i
am
not
saying
you
are
making
it
up
i
am
just
trying
to
point
out
that
the
situation
is
not
always
as
simple
as
it
might
seem
which
was
why
i
started
checking
every
time
i
got
sick
and
every
time
i
got
sick
msg
was
somehow
involved
in
one
of
the
food
products
and
consider
there
were
no
other
similar
ingredients
to
my
knowledge
it
might
not
please
a
medical
researcher
but
it
pleased
my
own
personal
physician
enough
for
him
to
give
me
allergy
medicine
and
most
importantly
its
enough
proof
for
me
to
avoid
it
and
enough
proof
that
my
incredibly
frugal
fiance
didnt
flinch
when
i
literally
threw
out
or
gave
away
all
the
food
products
in
his
pantry
that
had
msg
and
he
always
flinches
when
theres
waste
but
it
was
a
simple
explanation
i
wont
eat
this
stuff
i
wont
cook
with
this
stuff
so
i
can
either
throw
it
out
or
give
it
away
from
donna
pattee
my
guess
was
that
the
spice
mix
on
the
fries
contained
msg
probably
lawrys
seasoning
salt
i
love
the
way
that
tastes
im
not
saying
i
never
consume
anything
with
msg
ive
noticed
that
i
have
a
certain
tolerance
level
like
a
small
bag
of
bbq
chips
once
a
month
or
so
it
not
a
problem
but
that
same
bag
of
chips
will
bother
me
if
i
also
had
chicken
bouillon
yesterday
and
lunch
at
one
of
the
chinese
restaurants
the
day
before
from
catherine
l
kelley
all
thats
needed
now
is
that
final
step
a
doubleblind
study
done
on
humans
there
isnt
even
an
ethical
question
about
possible
harm
as
this
is
a
widely
used
and
approved
food
additive
but
some
say
that
only
of
the
population
has
a
problem
with
msg
some
say
its
more
like
but
lets
say
that
its
how
many
people
would
have
to
be
tested
that
would
have
a
problem
also
i
know
i
have
a
problem
with
it
and
i
wouldnt
volunteer
for
a
test
like
thanks
guys
but
i
dont
want
to
get
sick
also
im
sure
that
most
people
probably
have
varying
degrees
of
sensitivities
at
different
times
if
i
have
a
cold
im
much
more
susceptible
to
the
reaction
than
when
im
healthy
as
proven
today
when
im
stuffy
but
for
some
silly
reason
i
still
gave
in
and
decided
to
have
the
bbq
chips
from
kiran
wagle
because
too
many
of
you
generic
rhetorical
you
not
you
cathy
go
around
calling
this
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
thus
suggesting
to
the
people
you
complain
to
that
you
experience
this
only
from
chinese
food
msg
is
prevalent
in
a
lot
more
things
than
chinese
foodthats
why
i
suggested
calling
this
diner
syndrome
cathy
doesnt
i
havent
saved
all
my
postings
but
i
never
called
it
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
and
i
never
stated
i
got
it
only
from
chinese
food
i
just
thought
it
would
be
easiest
to
conduct
my
personal
test
at
a
chinese
take
out
place
that
i
knew
would
hold
or
not
hold
the
msg
i
cant
call
up
whoever
makes
doritos
and
ask
them
to
make
me
one
back
of
chips
without
msg
on
the
other
hand
if
one
complains
about
potatoes
from
a
mix
or
restaurant
spice
mixes
im
going
to
believe
them
and
if
anyone
says
they
got
msgsick
after
eating
too
many
barbecue
potato
chips
at
a
party
im
really
going
to
believe
them
well
i
believe
i
mentioned
that
in
an
earlier
post
lets
see
you
wrote
this
message
at
date
apr
but
on
date
apr
gmt
i
wrote
has
anyone
had
an
msg
reaction
from
something
other
than
a
chinese
restaurant
lots
of
times
thats
why
it
was
so
hard
for
me
to
pin
down
i
would
probably
have
been
easier
if
id
only
have
the
reaction
in
a
certain
type
of
restaurant
but
ive
had
the
reaction
in
chinese
restaurants
and
greek
restaurants
and
italian
restaurants
and
steak
places
i
can
tell
you
when
a
steak
joint
uses
accent
to
tenderize
their
meat
oh
and
just
in
case
anyone
thinks
im
prejudice
against
either
chinese
food
or
asian
people
im
not
going
home
to
cook
some
chinese
food
for
the
guy
im
marrying
next
week
incidentally
his
last
name
is
wu
so
stop
it
with
the
flame
mail
why
does
a
woman
work
ten
years
to
change
a
mans
habits
and
then
complain
that
hes
not
the
man
she
married
