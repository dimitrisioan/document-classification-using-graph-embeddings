biggest
reason
why
the
cost
of
medical
care
is
so
extremely
high
and
increasing
is
that
natural
methods
of
treatment
and
even
diagnosis
are
still
being
systematically
ignored
and
suppressed
by
the
moneygrubbing
and
power
mongering
medical
establishment

realize
that
all
medical
doctors
have
now
been
replaced
by
aliens

planet
are
you
from
and
once
you
got
here
did
you
encounter
those
prejudices
against
foreign
medical
graduates

of
all
rightthinking
people
