exercise
and
migraine
we
were
talking
about
migraine
and
exercise
im
the
one
who
cant
fathom
the
thought
of
exercise
during
migraine
anyway
turning
the
thread
around
the
other
day
i
played
tennis
during
my
lunch
hour
im
out
of
tennis
shape
so
it
was
very
intense
exercise
i
got
overheated
and
dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my
head
then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in
the
afternoon
i
took
cafergot
but
it
didnt
help
and
the
pain
started
although
it
wasnt
as
intense
as
it
usually
is
and
about
pm
that
night
the
pain
subsided
this
isnt
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
im
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
im
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
dont
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this
thanks
