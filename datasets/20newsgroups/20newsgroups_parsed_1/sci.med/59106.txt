if
anyone
knows
of
any
database
or
newsgroup
or
as
i
mentioned
up
above
any
information
relating
to
this
disorder
i
would
sure
appreciate
hearing
from
you
i
am
not
trying
to
play
doctor
here
but
only
trying
to
gather
information
about
it
as
i
know
now
these
particular
types
of
disorders
are
still
not
really
well
understood
by
the
medical
community
and
so
im
going
to
see
nowif
somehow
the
internet
can
at
least
give
me
alittle
insight
thanks
there
is
no
database
for
infantile
spasms
nor
a
newsgroup
that
i
know
of
the
medical
library
will
be
the
best
source
of
information
for
you

skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
