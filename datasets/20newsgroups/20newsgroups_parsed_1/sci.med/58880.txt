desperate
with
some
vd
i
have
bad
luck
and
got
a
vd
called
granuloma
ingunale
which
involves
the
growth
of
granules
in
the
groin
i
found
out
about
it
by
checking
medicine
books
and
i
found
the
prescriptions
and
i
know
i
can
just
go
to
a
clinic
to
get
it
cured
but
unfortunately
i
am
serving
my
duty
in
the
army
right
now
and
i
think
its
impossible
to
prevent
anyone
from
knowing
this
if
i
take
leaves
every
day
for
two
weeks
for
treatment
thus
i
bought
the
prescribed
tablets
at
some
drugstore
but
to
cure
it
i
must
get
injection
of
streptomycin
with
a
dose
of
g
every
hours
for
at
least
days
i
can
probably
buy
the
tools
and
this
solution
somewhere
but
i
dont
know
how
to
do
injection
by
myself
can
any
kind
people
here
tell
me
if
its
possible
to
do
it
can
i
do
it
on
my
arm
or
it
must
be
done
on
the
hip
only
any
info
is
welcome
and
please
write
me
or
post
your
help
soon
i
am
already
taking
the
tablets
and
i
cant
wait
please
dont
flame
me
for
posting
this
and
dont
judge
me
ive
learned
a
lesson
and
all
i
need
now
is
real
medical
help
desperate
from
taipei
