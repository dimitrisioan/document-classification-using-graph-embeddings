if
you
can
get
away
without
ever
ordering
imaging
for
a
patient
with
an
obviously
benign
headache
syndrome
id
like
to
hear
what
your
magic
is
i
certainly
cant
always
avoid
it
unless
i
want
to
be
rude
i
suppose
i
made
a
decision
a
while
back
that
i
will
not
be
bullied
into
getting
studies
like
a
ct
or
mri
when
i
dont
think
they
are
indicated
if
the
patient
wont
accept
my
explanation
of
why
i
think
the
study
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
money
i
suggest
a
second
opinion

absurdities
