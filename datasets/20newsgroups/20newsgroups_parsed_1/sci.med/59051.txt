reply
to
md
after
many
metabolic
tests
body
structure
tests
and
infectionvirus
tests
the
doctors
still
do
not
know
quite
what
type
of
siezures
he
is
having
although
they
do
have
alot
of
evidence
that
it
is
now
pointing
to
infantile
spasms
this
is
where
we
stand
right
nowas
i
know
now
these
particular
types
of
disorders
are
still
not
really
well
understood
by
the
medical
community
infantile
spasms
have
been
well
understood
for
quite
some
time
now
you
are
seeing
a
pediatric
neurologist
arent
you
if
not
i
strongly
recommend
it
there
is
a
new
anticonvulsant
about
to
be
released
called
felbamate
which
may
be
particularly
helpful
for
infantile
spasms
as
for
learning
more
about
seizures
ask
your
doctor
or
his
nurse
about
a
local
support
group

wi
this
is
patently
absurd
but
whoever
wishes
to
become
a
philosopher
must
learn
not
to
be
frightened
by
absurdities
