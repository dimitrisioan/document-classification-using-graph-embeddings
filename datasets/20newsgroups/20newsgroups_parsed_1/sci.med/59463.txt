do
i
ever
after
years
of
having
health
problems
that
had
been
cleared
up
wallery
shots
and
not
knowing
why
i
went
and
was
retested
i
actually
did
better
than
when
i
had
been
tested
years
ago
then
putting
together
i
realized
that
it
all
started
back
up
when
the
laser
printer
came
into
the
office
i
kept
track
of
the
usage
and
on
hi
use
days
i
was
worse
i
got
better
over
the
weekends
the
laser
printer
is
gone
im
better
whether
it
is
the
toner
dust
or
chemicals
i
dont
know
i
am
highly
allergic
to
dust
but
it
definitely
was
the
laser
printer
