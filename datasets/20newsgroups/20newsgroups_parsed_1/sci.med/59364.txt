wrote
a
woman
once
told
me
her
doctor
told
her
that
i
could
catch
asymptomatically
her
yeast
infection
from
her
then
give
it
back
to
her
causing
a
relapse
probably
bogus
but
if
not
its
another
reason
to
use
latex
steve
it
isnt
bogus
i
had
chronic
vaginal
yeast
infections
that
would
go
away
with
cream
but
reappear
in
about
weeks
i
had
been
on
rounds
of
antibiotics
for
a
resistant
sinus
infection
and
my
husband
had
been
on
amoxicillin
also
for
a
sinus
infection
after
six
months
of
this
i
went
to
a
gynecologist
who
had
me
culture
my
husband
seminal
fluid
after
days
incubation
he
had
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
growth
it
was
confirmed
by
the
lab
a
round
of
nizerol
for
him
cleared
