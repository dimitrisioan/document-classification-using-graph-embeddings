isnt
there
a
relatively
new
treatment
for
kidney
stones
involving
a
noninvasive
use
of
ultrasound
where
the
patient
is
lowered
into
some
sort
of
liquid
when
heshe
undergoes
treatment
im
sure
ive
read
about
it
somewhere
if
i
remember
it
correctly
it
is
a
painless
and
effective
treatment
the
use
of
shock
waves
not
ultrasound
to
break
up
stones
has
been
around
for
a
few
years
depending
on
the
type
of
machine
and
intensity
of
the
shock
waves
it
is
usually
uncomfortable
enough
to
require
something
the
highpower
machines
cause
enough
pain
to
require
general
or
regional
anesthesia
afterwards
it
feels
like
someone
slugged
you
pretty
good
