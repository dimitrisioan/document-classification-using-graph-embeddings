re
mind
machines
i
use
a
zygon
mind
machine
as
bought
in
the
usa
last
year
although
its
no
wonder
cure
for
what
ails
you
it
is
however
very
good
at
stopping
you
thinking
sound
strange
well
suppose
youre
tired
and
want
to
go
to
bedsleep
but
your
head
is
full
of
niggling
problems
to
resolve
you
lay
in
the
bed
and
quickly
they
all
come
to
the
surface
churning
around
from
one
unresolved
thing
to
the
next
and
then
back
again
been
there
bought
the
tshirt
i
slip
on
the
zygon
and
select
a
soothing
pattern
of
light
sound
and
quickly
i
just
cant
concentrate
on
the
previous
stuff
your
brains
cache
kinda
gets
flushed
and
you
start
on
a
whole
new
set
of
stuff
a
useful
addition
is
the
facility
to
feed
the
output
of
a
tape
player
or
cd
through
the
box
i
use
new
age
elevator
muzak
to
enhance
the
overall
effect
deffo
better
than
a
pill
