is
another
anecdotal
story
i
am
a
picky
eater
and
never
wanted
to
try
chinese
food
however
i
finally
tried
some
in
order
to
please
a
girl
i
was
seeing
at
the
time
i
had
never
heard
of
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
a
group
of
us
went
to
the
restaurant
and
all
shared
different
dishes
it
didnt
taste
great
but
i
decided
it
wasnt
so
bad
we
went
home
and
went
to
bed
early
i
woke
up
at
am
and
puked
my
guts
outs
i
threw
up
for
so
long
that
im
not
kidding
i
pulled
a
muscle
in
my
tongue
dry
heaves
and
everything
no
one
else
got
sick
and
im
not
allergic
to
anything
that
i
know
of
suffice
to
say
that
i
wont
go
into
a
chinese
restaurant
unless
i
am
physically
threatened
the
smell
of
the
food
makes
me
ill
and
that
is
a
psycholgical
reaction
when
i
have
been
dragged
in
to
suffer
through
beef
and
broccoli
without
any
sauces
i
insist
on
no
msg
i
havent
gotten
sick
yet
i
had
a
similar
reaction
to
chinese
food
but
came
to
a
completly
different
conclusion
ive
eaten
chinese
food
for
ages
and
never
had
problems
i
went
with
some
chinese
malaysian
friends
to
a
swanky
chinses
rest
and
they
ordered
lots
of
stuff
i
had
never
seen
before
the
only
thing
i
can
remember
of
that
meal
was
the
first
course
scallops
served
in
the
shell
with
a
soytype
sauce
i
thought
well
ive
only
had
scallops
once
and
i
was
sick
after
but
that
could
have
been
a
coincidence
that
night
as
i
sat
on
the
bathroom
floor
sweating
and
emptying
my
stomach
the
hard
way
i
decided
i
would
never
touch
another
scallop
i
may
not
be
allergic
but
i
dont
want
to
take
the
chance
