one
problem
is
very
few
scientists
are
interested
in
alternative
medicine
so
gordon
why
do
you
think
this
is
so
probably
because
most
of
them
come
packaged
with
some
absurd
theory
behind
them
eg
homoeopathy
like
cures
like
the
more
you
dilute
things
the
more
powerful
they
get
even
if
you
dilute
them
so
much
there
is
no
ingredient
but
water
left
chiropractic
all
illness
stems
from
compressions
of
nerves
by
misaligned
vertebrae
such
systems
are
so
patently
absurd
that
any
good
they
do
is
accidental
and
not
related
to
the
theory
the
only
exception
is
probably
herbalism
because
scientists
recognize
the
potent
drugs
that
derive
from
plants
and
are
always
interested
in
seeing
if
they
can
find
new
plants
that
have
active
and
useful
substances
but
that
isnt
what
is
meant
by
alternative
medicine
usually
if
you
get
into
the
qi
accupuntunce
charts
etc
you
are
now
back
to
silly
theories
that
probably
have
nothing
to
do
with
why
accupuncture
works
in
some
cases
perhaps
another
reason
they
are
reluctant
is
the
rhine
experience
rhine
was
a
scientist
who
wanted
to
investigate
the
paranormal
and
his
lab
was
filled
with
so
much
chacanery
and
fakery
that
people
dont
want
to
be
associated
with
that
sort
of
thing
gordon
banks
njxp
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
