subject
re
krillean
photography
i
seem
to
recall
that
there
was
an
article
in
radio
electronics
about
this
subject
in
fact
i
have
a
copy
of
the
article
in
front
of
me
but
i
cant
find
anywhere
in
the
article
a
refrence
as
to
what
month
it
was
in
the
system
they
describe
uses
an
automobile
ignition
coil
for
the
high
voltage
the
article
even
includes
some
information
on
what
kind
of
film
to
use
and
where
to
get
it
hope
this
helps
