colonics
and
purification
recently
ive
come
upon
a
body
of
literature
which
promotes
colon
cleansing
as
a
vital
aid
to
preventive
medicine
through
nutrition
in
particular
dr
bernard
jenssen
in
his
book
colon
cleansing
for
health
and
longevity
the
title
actually
escapes
me
but
it
is
very
similar
to
that
claims
that
regular
selfadministered
colonics
along
with
certain
orally
ingested
debrisloosening
agents
boosts
the
immune
system
to
a
significant
degree
he
also
plugs
a
unique
appliance
called
the
colema
board
which
facilitates
the
selfadministration
of
colonics
it
sells
for
over
from
a
californiabased
company
he
also
plugs
vitratox
products
as
his
chemical
agents
of
choice
these
include
volcanic
ash
supposedly
for
its
electrical
charge
and
psyllium
powder
for
its
bulkiness
if
anyone
knows
anything
about
colon
cleansing
theory
its
particulars
or
the
colema
board
and
related
products
id
be
very
interested
to
hear
about
research
and
personal
experience
this
article
is
crossposted
to
altmagick
as
the
issue
touches
upon
fasting
and
cleansing
through
a
ritual
system
of
purification
