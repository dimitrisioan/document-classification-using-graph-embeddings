vitamin

ive
sent
gordon
r
my
posts
on
protein
vitamin
c
and
vitamin
a
prior
to
posting
on
internet
as
a
professional
courtesy
somehow
ive
managed
to
delete
my
vitamin
a
post
from
my
text
file
gordon
r
had
promised
to
send
it
back
to
me
but
hes
pretty
mad
at
me
right
now
so
ill
just
retype
it
since
digging
through
all
my
references
is
very
time
consumingtook
me
all
day
for
that
pms
post
im
not
going
to
cite
any
referencesgordon
r
has
them
im
going
to
include
some
of
the
material
from
weinsier
and
morgans
new
nutrition
textbookwhich
was
not
in
my
original
material
to
point
out
that
what
im
going
to
say
has
some
support
in
the
medical
community
diet
has
been
know
to
affect
the
immune
system
of
man
for
a
very
very
long
time
protein
has
always
had
the
biggest
role
in
infection
and
ive
already
covered
the
role
of
protein
in
protecting
you
against
infection
now
im
going
to
hit
what
i
consider
to
be
the
most
important
nutrient
in
the
us
as
far
as
infection
is
concernedvitamin
a
when
vitamin
a
was
originally
discovered
it
was
commonly
referred
to
as
the
antiinfection
vitamin
many
peoplelinus
pauling
being
one
have
decided
to
take
this
title
away
from
vitamin
a
and
give
it
to
vitamin
c
which
ive
already
covered
big
mistakein
my
opinion
vitamin
a
is
also
getting
a
reputation
as
an
anticancer
vitaminwith
good
reason
the
nci
currently
has
numerous
clinical
trials
in
progress
to
see
if
vitamin
a
can
not
only
prevent
cancer
but
cure
it
as
well
its
role
in
both
cancer
and
infection
is
almost
identicalbut
not
quite
vitamin
a
comes
in
two
completely
different
formsretinol
and
betacarotene
retinol
is
the
animal
form
and
its
toxic
betacarotene
is
the
plant
form
and
its
completely
nontoxic
both
retinol
and
beta
carotene
display
good
absorption
in
the
human
gut
if
bile
is
present
the
liver
stores
all
of
your
retinol
and
doles
it
out
for
other
tissues
to
use
by
synthesizing
retinol
binding
proteinrbp
a
normal
human
adult
liver
should
have
iu
to
iu
of
retinol
stored
we
are
born
with
iu
in
our
liver
us
autopsy
has
shown
that
about
of
americans
die
with
the
sameor
less
amount
of
vitamin
a
as
they
were
born
with
if
you
dont
believe
that
nutritional
reserveslike
that
of
retinol
in
the
liver
are
important
then
this
low
vitamin
a
reserve
is
not
going
to
affect
you
but
if
you
believelike
i
do
that
the
nutrient
reserves
are
important
then
there
is
a
problem
with
vitamin
a
in
the
us
the
us
rda
for
vitamin
a
in
an
adult
male
is
re
or
iu
of
vitamin
a
for
adult
feamles
its
re
or
iu
of
vitamin
a
diet
surveys
show
that
most
americans
are
getting
this
amount
of
vitamin
a
either
retinol
or
betacarotene
from
their
diet
but
the
nrcnational
research
council
was
going
to
release
a
new
rda
table
in
that
had
the
rda
for
both
vitamin
a
and
vitamin
c
raisedc
to
mg
per
day
and
a
to
iu
per
day
for
adult
males
that
report
and
its
recommendations
was
killed
why
concern
over
the
increasing
supplementation
was
the
main
reason
rdas
are
set
to
prevent
clinical
disease
not
to
keep
nutrient
reserves
full
many
scientist
in
the
us
feel
that
the
time
has
come
to
move
away
from
the
prevention
of
clinical
pathology
concept
and
move
towards
the
promotion
of
optimum
health
concept
especially
since
we
have
some
very
good
data
now
that
show
that
nutrient
reserves
are
extremely
important
during
periods
of
stress
the
nutritonal
concervatives
won
that
battle
and
a
new
group
of
scientist
were
collected
to
come
out
with
the
rda
list
which
lowered
the
rda
for
several
nutrients
and
moved
the
dietary
guidelines
back
to
where
they
were
when
we
first
started
in
the
sget
enough
to
prevent
clinical
pathology
but
not
enough
to
fill
the
reserves
we
know
from
autopsy
that
only
about
of
americans
have
a
liver
with
a
normal
vitamin
a
reserveiu
to
iu
i
preach
nutrient
reserves
to
my
students
and
tell
them
to
measure
them
in
their
patients
but
for
vitamin
a
only
a
liver
biopsyor
autopsy
data
will
tell
you
how
much
somebody
has
stored
we
can
tell
very
easily
if
someone
has
overfilled
his
or
her
liver
with
vitamin
a

measuring
the
serium

levellevels
above
ugdl
are
highly
suggestive
that

have

wallach
md
a
little
brown
series
book
this
level
of
vitamin
a
in
blood
means
that
medical
attention
is
necessary
due
to
vitamin
a
toxicity
weinsier
and
morgan
take
a
much
more
conservative
approach
to
vitamin
a
toxicity
than
does
wallach
as
you
will
see
later
in
this
post
between
ugdl
and
ugdl
you
should
have
plenty
of
warning
that
its
time
to
eliminate
the
retinol
from
your
dietheadache
redness
of
the
skin
hair
loss
joint

i
tell
all
my
students
that
will
use
vitamin
a
in
their
practice
that
they
had
better
monitor
the
serum
retinol
level
and
stop
when
there
are
clear
signs
that
the
liver
is
full
you
will
never
really
know
if
the
patient
needs
the
vitamin
abecause
you
can
not
measure
the
pool
in
liver
but
you
will
always
know
when
its
time
to
stopjust
like
in
those
vitamin
a
for
pms
studies
betacarotene
can
be
taken
to
fill
up
your
liver
with
retinol
and
you
will
never
have
to
worry
about
toxicity
because
the
conversion
of
betacarotene
to
retinol
that
occurs
in
both
your
gut
and
your
liver
will
slow
downstops
in
the
liver
and
slows
down
in
the
gut
when
your
liver
is
full
of
retinol
but
taking
betacarotene
as
the
source
of
retinol
takes
a
very
long
time
to
fill
the
liver
upive
seen
estimates
of
years
if
you
are
in
the
that
only
has
as
much
as
you
were
born
with
in
your
liveriu
one
other
problem
with
betacarotene
if
you
have
a
zinc
deficit
you
will
not
convert
as
much
betacarotene
to
retinol
in
the
gut
or
the
liver
because
the
enxzyme
that
does
this
conversion
requires
zinc
in
addition
the
release
of
retinol
from
the
liver
is
a
zinc
dependent
process
so
a
zinc
deficit
will
cause
a
vitamin
a
deficit
even
if
your
liver
has
plenty
of
vitamin
a
now
what
does
vitamin
a
do
in
cancer
and
infection
protection
the
body
uses
vitamin
aretinol
for
many
different
things
visionthe
first
to
be
nailed
down
and
where
you
see
overt
clinical
pathology
uses
the
aldehyde
retinal
and
alcoholretinol
form
of
vitamin
a
reproduction
uses
the
retinol
form
and
some
retinal
infection
and
cancer
protection
uses
retinoic
acid
how
do
you
convert
retinolwhich
your
white
blood
cells
and
the
mucosal
cells
get
from
blood
to
retinoic
acid
you
use
enzymes
one
of
which
requires
vitamin
cthis
is
why
pauling
has
tried
to
pull
the
title
of
antiinfection
vitamin
away
from
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
does
play
a
role
in
infectioninterferon
production
for
example
but
its
biggest
role
is
the
conversion
of
retinol
to
retinoic
acid
if
you
increase
your
intake
of
vitamin
c
you
will
increase
your
formation
of
retinoic
acid
but
retinoic
acid
can
not
be
converted
back
to
retinolas
retinal
can
and
once
its
formed
its
used
and
then
lost
to
the
body
this
is
why
the
nrc
group
wanted
to
increase
both
vitamin
c
and
vitamin
a
rdas
most
people
taking
large
amounts
of
vitamin
c
really
think
that
they
are
helping
themselves
if
they
dont
have
much
vitamin
a
in
their
liver
and
they
are
not
also
increasing
their
intake
of
vitamin
a
they
actually
do
themselves
more
harm
than
good
retinoic
acid
functions
in
white
blood
cells
to
promote
antibody
formation
in
the
mucus
membrane
it
is
the
main
factor
in
promoting
good
mucus
production
and
a
good
epithelial
cell
barrier
to
prevent
infectious
agents
from
entering
the
blood
system
the
mucus
membrane
is
referred
to
as
the
first
line
defense
against
infection
for
cancer
retinoic
acid
has
been
shown
to
act
as
a
cell
brakeit
counteracts
the
effect
of
cell
promoters
which
stimulate
cells
to
divide
cancer
has
two
distinct
steps
dna
alteration
and
cell
promotion
for
cells
that
normally
divide
all
the
time
promoters
are
not
that
important
but
for
lung
and
breast
tissue
which
does
not
normally
divide
promoters
are
real
important
in
the
malignant
process
this
is
the
major
reason
why
the
nci
has
so
many
different
clinical
trials
in
progress
using
retinol
andor
betacarotene
chronic
infectionirritation
of
the
mucus
membranes
is
a
signal
that
vitamin
a
may
not
be
adequate
i
tell
my
students
that
any
patient
who
walks
into
their
office
with
a
complaint
of
chronic
infection
has
to
be
worked
up
for
vitamin
aalong
with
the
other
factors
that
medicine
already
has
on
its
list
of
causes
for
chronic
infection
i
drive
this
home
in
my
course
at
the
osteopathic
college
in
tulsa
when
i
teach
at
the
allopathic
medical
school
in
tulsaous
branch
campus
and
when
i
give
cme
lectures
dark
adaptation
is
the
best
clinical
test
for
vitamin
a
status
since
night
vision
is
impacted
when
liver
reverves

to
iu
of
retinol
the
serum
level
of
retinol
can
also
be
used
but
it
does
not
drop
until

reserves
drop

asking
a

if
they

a

out
in

study

on

spanishamericans
where
serum
retinol
levels
were
measured
of
the
sample
population
had
a
serum
retinol
level
below

as
more
studies
are
done
on
serum
retinol
levels
in
population
groups
of
the
us
that
have
had
a
history
of
high
infection
rates
we
will
probably
see
a
much
stonger
correlation
between
infection
incidence
rates
and
low
serum
retinol
levels
what
do
weinsier
and
morgan
have
to
say
about
vitamin
a
here
are
excerpts
from
their
book
vitamin
a
functions
in
vision
in
the
forrm
of
retinol
it
is
necessay
for
growth
and
differentation
of
epithelial
tissue
and
is
required
for
reproduction
embryonic
development
and
bone
growth
proteincalorie
malnutrition
and
zinc
deficiency
may
impair
the
absorption
transport
and
metabolism
of
vitamin
a
retinaldehyde
is
converted
to
retinoic
acid
which
has
biological
activity
in
growth
and
in
cell
diferentiation
but
not
in
reproduction
or
vision
the
most
common
procedure
to
evaluate
vitamin
a
status
is
to
measure
the
retinol
level
in
plasma
or
serum
the
normal
range
for
vitamin
a
content
for
a
child
is
to
ugdl
lower
values
are
indicators
of
deficiency
or
depleted
body
stores
serum
levels
greater
than
ugdl
are
indicative
of
toxic
levels
of
vitamin
a
dark
adaptation
tests
and
electroretinogram
measurements
are
also
useful
but
difficult
to
perform
on
young
children
rapidly
proliferating
tissues
are
sensitive
to
vitamin
a
deficiency
and
may
revert
to
an
undifferentiated
state
the
bronchorespiratory

gastrointestinal

and

are
adversely

a
daily
intake
of
more
than
mgabout
iu
of

is
not
advised
and
chronic
use
of
amounts
over
mgiu
can
result
in
a
dry

itching

desquamation
erythematous
dermatitis
hair

chapped

hyperostois
bony
depositis

anorexia

and

they
recommend
mg
of

via
im
injection
in
children
for
vitamin
a
deficiency
but
do
not
discuss
treatment
for
adults
their
toxic
serum
retinol
level
is
very
conservative
i
recommend
that
my
students
try
iu
in
adults
that
are
having
problems
with
chronic
infection
they
have
to
rule
out
a
zinc
deficit
first
by
getting
an
rbc
zinc
runor
if
their
clinical
lab
cant
run
it
i
tell
them
to
do
what
weinsier
and
morgan
suggest
give
them
the
zinc
along
with
the
vitamin
a
at
iu
per
day
toxicity
should
not
be
a
problem
and
you
will
not
have
to
worry
about
pulling
the
patient
into
the
office
on
a
regular
basis
to
run
a
serum
retinol
both
elaine
and
jon
found
doctors
who
used
a
much
higher
dose
of
vitamin
a
recall
that
the
pms
papers
were
using
iu
to
iu
of
vitamin
a
i
dont
suggest
that
my
students
use
these
high
doses
if
you
wanted
to
fill
the
liver
up
fastas
part
of
a
clinical
trial
and
were
monitoring
the
serum
retinol
level
then
you
would
be
okay
but
my
knowledge
of
the
vitamin
a
literature
suggests
to
me
that
iu
for
patients
with
a
demonstrated
vitamin
a
deficitdark
adapatation
test
or
serum
retinol
will
provide
a
good
and
steady
improvementas
long
as
zinc
and
vitamin
c
status
are
good
without
having
to
worry
about
toxicity
if
they
want
to
get
more
agressive
fine
if
they
follow
my
advise
to
check
the
serum
retinol
but
vitamin
aretinol
should
never
be
given
in
high
dose
to
women
who
could
become
pregnant
since
vitamin
a
shows
teratogenicity
towards
the
human
fetus
the
dose
needed
to
show
this
effect
on
the
developing
fetus
is
iu
of
retinol
per
day
betacarotene
will
never
have
this
effect
on
the
human
fetus
could
just
taking
betacarotene
instead
of
retinol
supplements
help
yes
but
the
effect
will
take
a
long
time
to
develop
my
advise
is
to
use
retinol
to
fill
the
liver
up
and
then
switch
to
betacarotene
to
keep
it
full
vitamin
a
is
probably
one
nutrient
that
is
better
off
left
to
prescription
by
doctors
but
when
we
have
the
mds
in
this
newsgroup
jumping
all
over
me
and
other
doctors
that
propose
the
use
of
vitamin
a
supplements
for
treating
patients
with
chronic
sinus
and
gi
distress
i
think
that
the
most
prudent
option
is
to
keep
vitamin
a
in
the
otc
market
but
require
manufactors
to
provide
package
inserts
to
educate
the
general
public
about
the
dangers
of
vitamin
a
supplementation
