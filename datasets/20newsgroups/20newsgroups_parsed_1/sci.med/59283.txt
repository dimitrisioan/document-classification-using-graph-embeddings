editorial
note
the
cesarean
rate
in
the
united
states
steadily
increased
from
through
however
the
findings
in
this
report
indicate
that
rates
have
been
stable
since
because
there
is
little
evidence
that
maternal
and
child
health
status
has
improved
during
this
time
and
because
cesareans
are
associated
with
an
increased
risk
for
complications
of
childbirth
a
national
health
objective
for
the
year
is
to
reduce
the
overall
cesarean
rate
to
or
fewer
per
deliveries
and
the
primary
cesarean
rate
to
or
fewer
per
deliveries
objective
postpartum
complications
including
urinary
tract
and
wound
infections
may
account
in
part
for
the
longer
hospital
stays
for
cesarean
deliveries
than
for
vaginal
births
moreover
the
prolonged
hospital
stays
for
cesarean
deliveries
substantially
increase
healthcare
costs
for
example
in
the
average
costs
for
cesarean
and
vaginal
deliveries
were
and
respectively
the
additional
cost
for
each
cesarean
delivery
includes
for
physician
fees
and
for
hospital
charges
if
the
cesarean
rate
in
had
been
the
year
objective
instead
of
the
number
of
cesarean
births
would
have
decreased
by
versus
resulting
in
a
savings
of
more
than
billion
in
physician
fees
and
hospital
charges
despite
the
steady
increase
in
vbac
rates
since
several
factors
may
impede
progress
toward
the
year
national
health
objectives
for
cesarean
delivery
for
example
vbac
rates
substantially
reflect
the
number
of
women
offered
trial
of
labor
which
has
been
increasingly
encouraged
since
of
women
who
are
offered
a
trial
of
labor
could
deliver
vaginally
a
level
already
achieved
by
many
hospitals
trial
of
labor
was
routinely
offered
in
of
hospitals
surveyed
in
the
most
recent

on
all
women
who
had
a
prior
cesarean
regardless
of
whether
a
trial
of
labor
was
attempted
to
reach
the
overall
cesarean
rate
goal
however
increases
in
the
vbac
rate
will
need
to
be
combined
with
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
primary
rate
one
hospital
succeeded
in
reducing
the
rate
of
cesarean
delivery
by
applying
objective
criteria
for
the
four
most
common
indications
for
cesarean
delivery
by
requiring
a
second
opinion
and
by
instituting
a
peerreview
process
other
recommendations
for
decreasing
cesarean
delivery
rates
include
eliminating
incentives
for
physicians
and
hospitals
by
equalizing
reimbursement
for
vaginal
and
cesarean
deliveries
public
dissemination
of
physician
and
hospitalspecific
cesarean

rates
to
increase
public
awareness
of
differences

editorial
note
in
uganda
the
increase
in
malaria
among
us
personnel
was
attributed
to
poor
adherence
to
both
recommended
malaria
chemoprophylaxis
regimens
and
use
of
personal
protection
measures
during
a
period
of
increased
malaria
transmission
and
intensified
chloroquine
resistance
in
subsaharan
africa
the
findings
in
this
report
underscore
the
need
to
provide
initial
and
continued
counseling
regarding
malaria
prevention
for
persons
living
abroad
in
malariaendemic
areas
preventive
measures
that
are
also
important
for
shortterm
travelers
to
such
areas
mefloquine
is
an
effective
prophylaxis
regimen
in
africa
and
in
most
other
areas
with
chloroquineresistant
p
falciparum
however
in
some
areas
eg
thailand
resistance
to
mefloquine
may
limit
its
effectiveness
in
africa
the
efficacy
of
mefloquine
compared
with
chloroquine
alone
in
preventing
infection
with
p
falciparum
is
mefloquine
is
safe
and
well
tolerated
when
given
at
mg
per
week
over
a
year
period
the
risk
for
serious
adverse
reactions
possibly
associated
with
mefloquine
prophylaxis
eg
psychosis
and
convulsions
is
low
ie
episodes
per
users
while
the
risk
for
less
severe
adverse
reactions
eg
dizziness
gastrointestinal
complaints
and
sleep
disturbances
is
similar
to
that
for
other
antimalarial
chemoprophylactics
doxycycline
has
similar
prophylactic
efficacy
to
mefloquine
but
the
need
for
daily
dosing
may
reduce
compliance
with
and
effectiveness
of
this
regimen
chloroquine
alone
is
not
effective
as
prophylaxis
in
areas
of
intense
chloroquine
resistance
eg
southeast
asia
and
africa
in
africa
for
persons
who
can
not
take
mefloquine
or
doxycycline
chloroquine
and
proguanil
is
an
alternative
although
less
effective
regimen
chloroquine
should
be
used
for
malaria
prevention
in
areas

occupational

provision

recommendations
emerged
from
the
workshop
to
define
the
association
between
the
appearance
of
oral
lesions
and
rate
of
progression
of
hiv
to
establish
a
universal
terminology
for
hivassociated
oral
lesions
to
look
for
more
effective
treatments
for

to
expand
molecular

studies
to

radically
changed
in
hiv
infection
was
detected
and
reported
largely
in
homosexual
and
bisexual
males
intravenous
drug
users
and
hemophiliacs
today
more
hiv
infection
is
seen
in
heterosexual
males
and
females
and
in
children
and
adolescents
while
the
predominant
impact
of
hiv
infection
has
been
felt
in
africa
a
major
increase
in
infection
rate
is
being
seen
in
southeast
asia
as
well
five
hundred
thousand
cases
have
been
reported
to
date
in
this
region
and
more
are
appearing
all
the
time
researchers
are
continuing
to
document
the
epidemiology
of
oral
lesions
such
as
hairy
leukoplakia
and
candidiasis
they
also
are
beginning

and

socialpolitical
issues
discussion
on
the
social
and
political
implications
of
hiv
infection
focused
on
changing
the
publics
attitude
that
aids
is
retribution
for
indiscriminate
sexual
behavior
and
drug
use
speakers
also
addressed
health
care
delivery
for
hivinfected
patients
and
the
need
to
educate
the
public
about
what
aids
is
and
how
it
is
acquired
saliva
and
salivary
glands
conference
speakers
described
transmission
issues
and
the
hivinhibitory
activity
of
saliva
the
strength
of
which
varies
among
the
different
salivary
secretions
whole
saliva
has
a
greater
inhibitory
effect
than
submandibular
secretions
which
in
turn
have
a
greater
inhibitory
effect
than
parotid
secretions
research
has
shown
that
at
least
two
mechanisms
are
responsible
for
salivary
inhibitory
activity
they
attributed
the
hivinhibitory
effect
of
saliva
to
the
aggregationagglutination
of
hiv
by
saliva
which
may
both
promote
clearance
of
virus
and
prevent
it
reaching
a
target
cell
and
direct
effects
on
the
virus
or
target
cells
other
topics
discussed
were
the
manifestation
of
salivary
gland
disease
in
hivinfected
persons
and
current
research
on
oral
mucosal
immunity
pediatric
issues
pediatric
aids
