hismanal
astemizole
is
most
definitely
linked
to
weight
gain
it
really
is
peculiar
that
some
antihistamines
have
this
effect
and
even
more
so
an
antihistamine
like
astemizole
which
purportedly
doesnt
cross
the
bloodbrain
barrier
and
so
tends
not
to
cause
drowsiness
it
also
gave
me
lots

pain
seemed
