cystic
breast
disease
my
mom
has
just
been
diagnosed
with
cystic
breast
disease
a
big
relief
as
it
was
a
lump
that
could
have
been
cancer
her
doctor
says
she
should
go
off
caffeine
and
chocolate
for
months
as
well
as
stopping
the
estrogen
shes
been
taking
for
menopauserelated
reasons
shes
not
thrilled
with
this
i
think
especially
because
she
just
gave
up
cigarettes
soon
she
wont
have
any
pleasures
left
now
i
thought
id
heard
that
cystic
breasts
were
common
and
not
really
a
health
risk
is
this
accurate
if
so
why
is
she
being
told
to
make
various
sacrifices
to
treat
something
thats
not
that
big
of
a
deal
thanks
for
any
information
chris
note
my
mailer
tends

garble
