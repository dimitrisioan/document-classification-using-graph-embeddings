does
anyone
know
about
these
studies
or
have
experience
with
feverfew
im
skeptical
but
open
to
trying
it
if
i
can
find
out
more
about
this
what
is
feverfew
and
how
much
would
you
take
to
prevent
migraines
if
this
is
a
good
idea
that
is
are
there
any
known
risks
or
side
effects
of
feverfew
thanks
in
advance
for
any
info
brenda
ive
tried
it
and
so
has
one
friend
of
mine
no
known
side
effects
or
risks
it
didnt
seem
to
work
for
us
but
several
studies
now
have
suggested
it
does
work
for
many
people
so
i
think
its
worth
a
try
you
can
find
it
in
capsule
form
at
health
food
stores
up
to
six
capsules
a
day
was
recommended
if
i
remember
correctly
it
can
also
be
prepared
as
a
tea
good
luck
