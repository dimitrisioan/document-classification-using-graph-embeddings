re
krillean
photography
i
did
a
science
project
on
kirlian
photography
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
was
able
to
obtain
wonderful
auras
from
rocks
and
pebbles
and
the
like
by
first
dunking
them
in
water
i
know
this
is
a
little
weird
but
i
know
that
world
magazine
you
know
national
geo
for
children
did
a
very
simple
and
concise
article
on
kirlian
photography
they
had
some
neat
pictures
too
a
friend
of
mines
mother
had
a
book
on
kirlian
photography
only
its
photographs
took
a
radiologist
to
interpret
they
world
magazine
warned
us
all
that
it
was
very
dangerous
probably
to
stop
curious
children
from
experimenting
with
it
mind
you
this
was
years
ago
at
least
and
boy
does
that
say
something
about
my
age
