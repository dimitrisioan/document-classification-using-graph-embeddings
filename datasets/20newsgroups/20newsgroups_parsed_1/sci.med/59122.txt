editorial
note
the
increase
in
reported
gonorrhea
cases
in
colorado
in
may
represent
an
overall
increase
in
the
occurrence
of
this
disease
or
more
complete
reporting
stimulated
by
visitations
to
laboratories
by
cdh
surveillance
staff
during
the
increases
in
confirmed
gonorrhea
cases
at
dmhc
and
in
culturepositivity
rates
in
three
of
four
laboratories
suggest
a
real
increase
in
gonorrhea
rather
than
a
reporting
artifact
however
the
stable
culturepositivity
rate
in
the
nonprofit
family
planning
laboratory
which
serves
a
network
of
clinics
statewide
indicates
that
the
gonorrhea
increase
did
not
uniformly
affect
all
segments
of
the
population
one
possible
explanation
for
the
increased
occurrence
of
gonorrhea
in
colorado
may
be
gang
and
drugrelated
sexual
behavior
as
implicated
in
a
recent
outbreak
of
drugresistant
gonorrhea
and
other
stds
in
colorado
springs
although
the
high
morbidity
census
tracts
in
the
denver
metropolitan
area
coincide
with
areas
of
gang
and
drug
activity
this
hypothesis
requires
further
assessment
to
examine
the
possible
role
of
drug
use
implicated
previously
as
a
factor
contributing
to
the
national
increase
in
syphilis
the
cdh
stdaids
program
is
collecting
information
from
all
persons
in
whom
gonorrhea
is
diagnosed
regarding
drug
use
exchange
of
sex
for
money
or
drugs
and
gang
affiliation
the
gonorrhea
rate
for
blacks
in
colorado
substantially
exceeds
the
national
health
objective
for
the
year
per
objective
a
race
is
likely
a
risk
marker
rather
than
a
risk
factor
for
gonorrhea
and
other
stds
risk
markers
may
be
useful
for
identifying
groups
at
greatest
risk
for
stds
and
for
targeting
prevention
efforts
moreover
race
specific
variation
in
std
rates
may
reflect

in

others
indicating
that
adults
who
do
not

themselves
are
less
likely

because
these
nonbelted
adults
are
at

more
likely

educational

the

emphasizes
the

however
when

future
areas
of

in
addition
to
ongoing
research
that
is
directed
exclusively
toward
the
management
of
infertile
couples
we
are
developing
the
technology
to
assist
couples
who
are
at
risk
for
producing
embryos
with
a
serious
hereditary
disease
this
technology
involves
biopsying
the
preimplantation
human
embryo
and
then
subjecting
the
biopsied
cells
to
genetic
analysis
using
either
dna
amplification
or
fluorescent
in
situ
hybridization
there
are
recent
reports
of
the
successful
application
of
dna
amplification
by
other
centers
for
example
for
diagnosis
of
the
genes
for
cystic
fibrosis
and
hemophilia
we
hope
to
apply
and
further
focus
fluorescent
in

hybridization
technology
for
probing
the
x
chromosome
the
identification
of
which
will
provide
a
scientific
basis
for
counselling
patients
who
exhibit
sexlinked
disorders
the
considerable
clinical
application
of
such
technology
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
circumvents
the
need
for
prenatal
diagnosis
in
addition
to
the
possibility
of
a
subsequent
termination
of
affected
fetuses
in

to
avoid
the

of
affected

this

occasionally
however
ivfet

while
some
programs
utilize
laparoscopic
egg
retrieval
in
the
operating
room
with
the
patient
under
general
anesthesia
we
undertake
the
less
costly
approach
of
ultrasoundguided
retrieval
in
our
infertility
unit
with
the
patient
sedated
couples
who
resort
to
ivfet
exhibit
such
pathologies
as
tubal
deficiencies
ovulatory
dysfunction
endometriosis
andor
mild
forms
of
male
factor
infertility
according
to
the
united
states
ivf
registry
the
overall
success
rate
for
ivfet
nationwide
has
stabilized
at
about
percent
per
cycle
results
from
our
program
involving
patients
who
have
undergone
ivfet
cycles
reflect
a
comparable
success
rate
nevertheless
the
overall
incidence
of
success
with
this
procedure
is
disconcertingly
low
and
emphasizes
the
need
to
address
those
physiological
factors
that
limit
achievement
of
a
higher
percentage
of
pregnancies
well
recognized
predictors
of
outcome
include
patient
age
response
to
exogenous
ovarian
stimulation
quality
of
sperm
and
number
of
repeated
ivfet
cycle
attempts
however
among
these
age
is
the
single
most
significant
determinant
of
conception
therefore
it
is
critical
that
such
patients
are
referred
to
an
assisted
reproduction
program
at
the
earliest
opportunity
following
failure
of
traditional
therapies
the
underlying
basis
for
the
negative
effect
of
age
on
fertility
has
not
been
clearly
delineated
beyond
recognition
that
the
number
of
eggs
available
for
retrieval
declines
markedly
with
age
fertilization
rates
significantly
decrease
in
eggs
retrieved
from
patients
who
are
over
years
and
provided
the
appropriate
hormonal
background
is
present
age
is
unrelated
to
uterine
competency
to
sustain
pregnancy
ongoing
research
in
our
center
therefore
is
investigating
physiological
changes
in
the
egg
that
may
be
impacted
by
age
we
have
determined
that
more
than
percent
of
eggs
that
fail
to
fertilize
in
vitro
are
chromosomally
abnormal
and
that
a
significant
proportion
of
these
abnormalities
are
accountable
to
patient
age
currently
the
only
recourse
for
such
patients
is
to
use
eggs
obtained
from
a
donor
our
program
has
initiated
recruitment
of
volunteer
egg
donors
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
a
list
of
recipients
interested
in
this
form
of
therapy
gift
this
hightech
art
procedure
is
performed
in
the
operating
room
usually
with
the
use
of
a
laparoscope
and
in
contrast
to
ivfet
involves
introducing
sperm
and
freshly
retrieved
eggs
into
the
lumen
of
the
fallopian
tube
an
average
of
eggstube
under
these
circumstances
fertilization
occurs
in
vivo
and
if
excess
eggs
are
retrieved
the
remainder
undergo
ivf
with
subsequent
options
for
embryo
transfer
in
that
cycle
or
freezing
for
transfer
in
a
subsequent
cycle
this
art
procedure
is
applied
to
cases
in
hicnet
medical
newsletter
page
volume
number
april
which
there
is
at
least
one
patent
fallopian
tube
but
the
couple
has
such
pathologies
as
ovulatory
dysfunction
endometriosis
male
factor
infertility
andor
idiopathic
infertility
the
data
reported
in
the
united
states
ivf
registry
for
through
indicate
that
the
overall
success
rate
with
gift
is
higher
than
that
obtained
with
the
ivfet
technique
range
of
clinical
pregnancies
for
gift
is
to
percent
and
for
ivfet
to
percent
in
view
of
this
fact
one
might
expect
more
patients
to
be
treated
with
gift
than
ivfet
however
in
our
program
we
have
taken
into
account
three
basic
concerns
which
while
substantially
reducing
the
number
of
gift
cycles
performed
benefit
the
patient
these
concerns
are
the
increased
costs
associated
with
performing
a
procedure
in
the
operating
room
the
risks
albeit
minimal
of
undergoing
general
anesthesia
and
the
considerable
benefits
to
be
accrued
from
obtaining
direct
information
on
the
quality
and
fertilizability
of
the
eggs
and
the
developmental
competency
of
resultant
embryos
the
increased
success
with
gift
undoubtedly
reflects
the
artificial
environment
provided
by
the
laboratory
in
the
ivfet
procedure
between
january
and
december
we
have
performed
a
total
of
gift
cycles
with
an
overall
success
rate
of
percent
embryo
cryopreservation
or
freezing
is
applied
in
our
program
when
embryos
result
from
residual
gift
eggs
or
from
nontransferred
ivf
embryos
this
procedure
not
only
provides
patients
with
a
subsequent
opportunity
for
success
at
much
reduced
costs
but
also
circumvents
the
legal
and
ethical
issues
relating
to
disposal
of
supernumerary
embryos
therefore
as
stipulated
by
the
american
fertility
society
ethical
guidelines
for
art
programs
from
both
a
practical
and
an
ethical
standpoint
all
assisted
reproduction
programs
should
have
the
capability
of
cryopreserving
human
embrys
gamete
micromanipulation
this
art
procedure
which
is
still
very
new
is
applied
to
couples
who
are
unaccepting
of
insemination
with
donor
semen
but
who
have
severe
male
factor
infertility
less
than
million
spermml
in
combination
with
fewer
than
perccent
motile
sperm
andor
less
than
percent
sperm
with
normal
morphology
we
are
currently
developing
the
procedure
of
subzonal
insertion
szi
which
entails
injecting
sperm
under
the
coating
around
the
egg
the
barrier
normally
penetrated
by
the
sperm
through
enzymatic
digestion
available
data
from
szi
programs
worldwide
indicate
that
only
to
percent
of
szi
cycles
result
in
a
pregnancy
this
statistic
undoubtedly
relates
to
limitations
imposed
by
abnormalities
inherent
in
the
sperm
therefore
we
are
currently
focusing
on
the
development
of
improved
techniques
for
the
recognition
and
selection
of
sperm
chosen
for
manipulation
such
efforts
are
unquestionably
worthwhile
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
technology
offers
the
only
realistic
opportunity
for
severe
male
factor
patients
to
establish
conception
