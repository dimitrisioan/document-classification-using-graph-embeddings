one
slightly
off
the
subject
case
in
point
my
brother
got
stung
by
a
bee
i
know
he
is
allergic
to
bee
stings
but
that
his
reaction
is
severe
localized
swelling
not
anaphylactic
shock
i
could
not
convince
the
doctors
of
that
however
because
thats
not
written
in
their
little
rule
book
of
course
bee
venom
isnt
a
single
chemical
could
be
your
brother
is
reacting
to
a
different
component
than
the
one
that
causes
anaphylactic
shock
in
other
people
similarly
chinese
food
isnt
just
msg
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ingredients
in
it
why
when
someone
eats
something
with
lots
of
ingredients
they
dont
normally
consume
one
of
which
happens
to
be
msg
do
they
immediately
conclude
that
any
negative
reaction
is
to
the
msg
i
would
not
be
surprised
in
the
least
to
find
out
the
some
people
have
bad
reactions
to
msg
including
headaches
stomachaches
and
even
vomiting
id
be
surprised
if
some
of
these
reactions
werent
due
to
other
ingredients

hey
i
understand
vaxen
and
vms
thats
what
i
get
paid
for
my
understanding
of
astronomy
is
purely
at
the
amateur
level
or
below
so
unless
what
im
saying
is
directly
related
to
vaxvms
dont
hold
me
or
my
organization
responsible
for
it
if
it
is
related
to
vaxvms
you
can
try
to
hold
me
responsible
for
it
but
my
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
