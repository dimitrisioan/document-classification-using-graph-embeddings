low
levels
of
airborne
particles
linked
to
serious
asthma
attacks
american
lung
association
a
new
study
published
by
the
american
lung
association
has
shown
that
surprisingly
low
concentrations
of
airborne
particles
can
send
people
with
asthma
rushing
to
emergency
rooms
for
treatment
the
seattlebased
study
showed
that
roughly
one
in
eight
emergency
visits
for
asthma
in
that
city
was
linked
to
exposure
to
particulate
air
pollution
the
actual
exposure
levels
recorded
in
the
study
were
far
below
those
deemed
unsafe
under
federal
air
quality
laws
people
with
asthma
have
inflamed
airways
and
airborne
particles
tend
to
exacerbate
that
inflammation
said
joel
schwartz
phd
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
who
was
the
lead
author
of
the
study
when
people
are
on
the
threshold
of
having
a
serious
asthma
attack
particles
can
push
them
over
the
edge
the
seattle
study
correlated
months
of
asthma
emergency
room
visits
with
daily
levels
of
pm
or
particulate
matter
with
an
aerodynamic
diameter
of
microns
or
less
these
finer
particles
are
considered
hazardous
because
they
are
small
enough
penetrate
into
the
lung
cities
are
considered
out
of
compliance
with
clean
air
laws
if
the
hour
average
concentration
of
pm
exceeds
micrograms
per
cubic
millimeter
of
air
in
seattle
however
a
link
between
fine
particles
and
asthma
was
found
at
levels
as
low
as
micrograms
the
authors
concluded
that
for
every
microgram
increase
in
the
fourday
average
of
pm
the
odds
of
someone
with
asthma
needing
emergency
treatment
increased
by
percent
the
findings
were
published
in
the
april
american
review
of
respiratory
disease
an
official
journal
of
the
american
thoracic
society
the
lung
associations
medical
section
the
study
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
recent
reports
to
suggest
that
particulate
matter
is
a
greatly
under
appreciated
health
threat
a
study
by
dr
schwartz
and
douglas
dockery
phd
of
harvard
found
that
particles
may
be
causing
roughly
premature
deaths
each
year
in
the
united
states
other
studies
have
linked
particulate
matter
to
increased
respiratory
symptoms
and
bronchitis
in
children
government
officials
and
the
media
are
still
very
focused
on
ozone
says
dr
schwartz
but
more
and
more
research
is
showing
that
particles
are
bad
actors
as
well
one
problem
in
setting
standards
for
particulate
air
pollution
is
that
pmio
is
difficult
to
study
unlike
other
regulated
pollutants
such
as
ozone
and
carbon
monoxide
particulate
matter
is
a
complex
and
varying
mixture
of
substances
including
carbon
hydrocarbons

acid
aerosols
researchers
cant
put
people
in
exposure
chambers
to
study
the
effects
of
particulate
air
pollution
says
dr
schwartz
we
have
no
way
of
duplicating
the
typical
urban
mix
of
particles
consequently
most
of
what
is
known
about
particulates
has
been
learned
through
populationbased
research
like
the
seattle
study
given
that
the
epas
current
priority
is
to
review
the
ozone
and
sulfur
dioxide
standards
the
agency
is
unlikely
to
reexamine
the
pm
standard
any
time
soon
until
changes
are
made
there
appears
to
be
little
people
with
asthma
can
do
to
protect
themselves
from
airborne
particles
in
some
areas
you
can
get
reports
on
air
quality
but
the
reports
only
cover
the
pollutant
that
is
closest
to
violating
its
standard
and
thats
rarely
particulate
matter
says
dr
schwartz
however
pm
doesnt
have
to
be
near
its
violation
range

brought

pathology
epidemiology
public
education
surveillance
techniques
and
potential
new
technologies
as
well
as
other
health
care
professionals
and
the
public
to
address
the
clinical

histological
characteristics
of
early
melanoma
the
appropriate
diagnosis
management

followup
of
patients
with

the
role
of
dysplastic

and
their
significance
and
the

of
education
and

in
preventing
melanoma
morbidity
and
mortality
following
days
of
presentations
by
experts
and
discussion
by
the
audience
a
consensus
panel
weighed
the
scientific
evidence
and
prepared
their
consensus
statement
among
their
findings
the
panel
recommended
that
melanoma
in

is
a
distinct
entity
effectively
treated
surgically
with
centimeter
margins
thin
invasive
melanoma
less
than

thick
has
the

for

survival
in
more
than

of
patients
after
surgical
excision
with
a
centimeter
margin
elective
lymph
node
dissections
and
extensive
staging
evaluations
are
not
recommended
in
early
melanoma
patients
with
early
melanoma
are
at
low
risk
for
relapse
but
may
be
at
high
risk
for
development
of
subsequent
melanomas
and
should
be
followed
closely
some
family
members
of
patients
with
melanoma
are
at
increased
risk
for
melanoma
and
should
be
enrolled
in

ncidesignated

the

program
is
comprised
of
ncidesignated
cancer
centers
actively
engaged
in
multidisciplinary
research
efforts
to
reduce
cancer
incidence
morbidity
and

within
the

there
are
four
types

cancer

comprehensive

approach
to
cancer

patient

and
community
outreach
and
consortium
cancer
centers
which
specialize
in

prevention
and

research
although
some
cancer
centers
existed
in
the
late
s
and
the
s
it
was
the
national
cancer
act
of
that
authorized
the
establishment
of
new
cancer
centers
as
well
as
continuing
support
for
existing
ones
the
passage
of
the
act
also
dramatically
transformed
the
centers
structure
and
broadened
the
scope
of
their
mission
to
include
all
aspects
of
basic
clinical
and
cancer
control
research
over
the
next
two
decades
the

program
grew
progressively
in
there
were
comprehensive
cancer
centers
in
the
nation
today
there
are
of
these
institutions
all
of
which
meet
specific
nci
criteria
for
comprehensive
status
to
attain
recognition
from
the
nci
as
a
comprehensive
cancer
center
an
institution
must
pass
rigorous
peer
review
under
guidelines
newly
established
in
the
eight
criteria
for
comprehensiveness
include
the
requirement
that
a
center
have
a
strong
core
of
basic
laboratory
research
in
several
scientific
fields
such
as
biology
and
molecular
genetics
a
strong
program
of
clinical
research
and
an
ability
to
transfer
research
findings
into
clinical
practice
moreover
five
of
the
criteria
for
comprehensive
status
go
significantly
beyond
that
required
for
attaining
a
cancer
center
support

also
referred
to
as
a
p
or
core
grant
the
mechanism
of
choice
for
supporting
the
infrastructure
of
a

operations
these
criteria
encompass
strong
participation
in
ncidesignated
highpriority
clinical
trials
significant
levels
of
cancer
prevention
and
control
research
and
important
outreach
and
educational
activitiesall
of
which
are
funded
by
a
variety
of
sources
the
other
types
of
cancer
centers
also
have
special
characteristics
and
capabilities
for
organizing
new
programs
of

that

the

ends
the

had
hoped
to
test

secretary

said
a

on
the
therapeutic

trials
was
expected
to
be
made
last
friday
companies

genentech
inc
chiron

immuno
ag
have
already
told

that
they

the

is
intended
to
demonstrate
whether
aids
vaccines
are
effective
in
thwarting
the
replication
of
hiv
in
patients
already
infected
shalala
refuted
last
weeks
reports
that
the
clinton
administration
had
decided
the
armys
test
of
the
microgenesys
vaxsyn
should
proceed
without
tests
of
others
at
the
same
time
the
report
was
inaccurate
and
i
expect
there
to
be
some
announcement
in
the
next
hours
about
that
particular
aids
research
project
said
shalala
administration
sources
subsequently
confirmed
that
nih
director
dr
bernadine
healy
and
food
and
drug
administration
commissioner
david
kessler
had
convinced
the
white
house
that
multiple
vaccines
should
be
tested
simultaneously
but
microgenesys
president
frank
volvovitz
said
a
test
of
multiple
vaccines
could
triple
the
cost
of
the
trial
and
