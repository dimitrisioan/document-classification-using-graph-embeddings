i
get
tired
of
people
saying
dont
eat
x
because
its
bad
well
x
may
not
be
bad
for
everyone
and
even
if
it
is
so
what
give
people
all
the
information
but
dont
ram
your
decisions
down
their
throats
it
is
evident
you
did
not
read
my
post
carefully
i
wasnt
trying
to
tell
you
not
to
eat
msg
products
and
produce
nor
was
i
arguing
for
or
against
msg
i
was
simply
questioning
the
logic
of
your
statement
that
simply
because
a
one
is
not
allergic
to
something
and
b
likes
eating
that
it
follows
that
one
could
keep
eating
whatever
it
is
in
my
post
i
had
clearly
said
that
i
dont
know
enough
about
msg
the
statement
dont
eat
x
because
its
bad
is
just
your
interpretation
of
nutritional
info
out
there
