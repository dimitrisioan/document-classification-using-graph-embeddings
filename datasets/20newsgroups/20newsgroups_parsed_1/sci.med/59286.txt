more
effective
in
fighting

than
any

used
alone
the

are
hopeful
that
hiv
when
faced
with
a
combination
of
several
drugs
requiring
mutation
at
different
sites
for
resistance
to
develop
will
be
unable

all
the

at

therefore
several

azt
has

basis
that

appeared

a

in

demonstrated
that
azt
should
not
be
used
early
in

of
disease
while
the
cd

given
azt

those
of

receiving

the

shown
that
the
proportions
of
people
in
the
two
groups
progressing
to
overt
aids
or
even
to
death
were
not
significantly
different
at
roughly
percent
the
conclusions
are
that
azt
is
not
an
effective
aids
drug
in
hivinfected
individuals
and
that
cd
cell
count
may
not
be
a
reliable
proxy
for
the
progression
to
aids
in

nothing
is

is

for

on
