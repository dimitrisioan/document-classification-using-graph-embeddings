mccurdy
m
writes
dyer
is
beyond
rude
ill
drink
to
that
yeah
yeah
yeah
i
didnt
threaten
to
rip
your
lips
off
did
i
snort
there
have
been
and
always
will
be
people
who
are
blinded
by
their
own
knowledge
and
unopen
to
anything
that
isnt
already
established
given
what
the
medical
community
doesnt
know
im
surprised
that
he
has
this
outlook
duh
nice
to
see
steve
still
has
his
high
and
almighty
intellectual
prowess
in
tact
for
the
record
i
have
had
several
outbreaks
of
thrush
during
the
several
past
few
years
with
no
indication
of
immunosuppression
or
nutritional
deficiencies
i
had
not
taken
any
antobiotics
listen
thrush
is
a
recognized
clinical
syndrome
with
definite
characteristics
if
you
have
thrush
you
have
thrush
because
you
can
see
the
lesions
and
do
a
culture
and
when
you
treat
it
it
generally
responds
well
if
youre
not
otherwise
immunocompromised
norings
analretentive
idee
fixe
on
having
a
fungal
infection
in
his
sinuses
is
not
even
in
the
same
category
here
nor
are
these
walking
neurasthenics
who
are
convinced
they
have
candida
from
reading
a
quack
book
yawn
my
dentist
who
sees
a
fair
amount
of
thrush
recommended
acidophilous
after
i
began
taking
acidophilous
on
a
daily
basis
the
outbreaks
ceased
when
i
quit
taking
the
acidophilous
the
outbreaks
periodically
resumed
i
resumed
taking
the
acidophilous
with
no
further
outbreaks
since
then
so
exactly
my
question
to
you
steve
whats
your
point
this
person
had
one
you
didnt
steve
dyer
nice
to
see
that
some
things
never
change
steve
if
you
arent
being
ignorant
in
one
group
alternative
youre
into
another
one
positive
thing
came
out
of
it
you
are
no
longer
bothering
the
folks
in
alternative
its
just
a
shame
that
these
people
have
to
suffer
so
that
others
may
breath
freely
sorry
for
wasting
bandwidth
folks
dont
forget
to
bow
down
once
every
second
day
and
to
offer
your
first
born
to
the
almight
omniscient
omnipotent
mr
steve
