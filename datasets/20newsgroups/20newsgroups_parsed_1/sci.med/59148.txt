someone
wrote
in
expressing
concern
about
getting
aids
from
acupuncture
needles
unless
your
friend
is
sharing
fluids
with
their
acupuncturist
who
themselves
has
aidsit
is
unlikely
not
impossible
they
will
get
aids
from
acupuncture
needles
generally
even
if
accidently
inoculated
the
normal
immune
response
should
be
enough
to
effectively
handle
the
minimal
contaminant
involved
with
acupuncture
needle
insertion
isnt
this
what
hiv
is
about
the
normal
immune
response
to
an
exposure
most
acupuncturists
use
disposable
needlesuse
once
and
throw
away
i
had
electrical
pulse
nerve
testing
done
a
while
back
the
needles
were
taken
from
a
dirty
drawer
in
an
instrument
cart
and
were
most
certainly
not
sterile
or
even
clean
for
that
matter
more
than
likely
they
were
fresh
from
the
previous
patient
i
was
concerned
but
i
kept
my
mouth
shut
i
probably
should
have
raised
hell
any
comments
no
excuses
