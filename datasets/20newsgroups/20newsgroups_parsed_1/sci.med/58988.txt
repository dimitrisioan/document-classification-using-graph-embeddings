krillean
photography
i
think
thats
the
correct
spelling
i
am
looking
for
any
informationsupplies
that
will
allow
doityourselfers
to
take
krillean
pictures
im
thinking
that
education
suppliers
for
schools
might
have
a
appartus
for
sale
but
i
dont
know
any
of
the
companies
any
info
is
greatly
appreciated
in
case
you
dont
know
krillean
photography
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
involves
taking
pictures
of
an
most
of
the
time
organic
object
between
charged
plates
the
picture
will
show
energy
patterns
or
spikes
around
the
object
photographed
and
depending
on
what
type
of
object
it
is
the
spikes
or
energy
patterns
will
vary
one
might
extrapolate
here
and
say
that
this
proves
that
every
object
within
the
universe
as
we
know
it
has
its
own
energy
signature
