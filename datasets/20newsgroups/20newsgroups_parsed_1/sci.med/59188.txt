can
you
provide
a
reference
to
substantiate
that
gaining
back
the
lost
weight
does
not
constitute
weight
rebound
until
it
exceeds
the
starting
weight
or
is
this
oral
tradition
that
is
shared
only
among
you
obesity
researchers
annals

ny
acad

hmmm
these
dont
look
like
references
to
me
is
passiveaggressive
behavior
associated

weight
rebound
i
purposefully
left
off
the

numbers

the
volumes
mentioned
and

good
story
chuck
but

i
couldnt
find
any
reference
to
weight
rebound
im
not
saying
it
isnt
there
but
since
you
cited
it
it
is
your
responsibility
to
show
me
where
it
is
in
there
there
is
no
index
i
suspect
you
overstepped
your
knowledge

as
usual

is
the
chastity

and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
its
on

about
inches
up
from
the
bottom
and
an
inch
in

know
what
some
people
havent
read
