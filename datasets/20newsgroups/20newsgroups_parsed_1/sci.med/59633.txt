people
against
cancer
seems
to
offer
pretty
questionable
information
not
exactly
the
place
a
cancer
patient
should
be
advised
to
turn
to
and
where
do
you
advise
people
to
turn
for
cancer
information
most
maybe
all
of
the
infomation
in
their
latest
catalogue
concern
treatments
that
have
been
shown
to
be
ineffective
against
cancer
and
many
of
the
treatments
are
quite
dangerous
as
well
it
seems
to
me
youve
offered
a
circular
refutation
of
mosss
organization
who
has
shown
the
information
in
the
latest
book
of
pac
to
be
questionable
could
it
be
those
regulatory
agencies
and
medical
industries
which
moss
is
showing
to
be
operating
with
major
vested
interests
whether
one
believes
that
these
vested
interests
are
real
or
not
or
whether
or
not
they
actually
shape
medical
research
is
a
seperate
argument
if
one
sees
a
possibility
however
that
these
interests
exist
then
the
fact
that
some
of
the
information
put
out
by
pac
has
been
refuted
by
the
medical
industry
doesnt
hold
much
weight
as
for
the
ineffectiveness
of
antineoplasteons
the
fact
that
the
nih
didnt
find
them
effective
doesnt
make
much
sense
here
of
course
they
didnt
i
tend
to
have
more
faith
in
the
word
of
the
patients
who
are
now
alive
after
being
told
years
ago
that
they
would
be
dead
of
cancer
soon
they
are
fighting
like
hell
to
keep
that
clinic
open
and
they
credit
his
treatment
with
their
survival
anyone
who
looks
at
the
nihs
record
for
investigation
of
alterna
tive
cancer
therapies
will
easily
see
that
they
have
a
strange
knack
for
find

relatively
cheap

nontoxic
