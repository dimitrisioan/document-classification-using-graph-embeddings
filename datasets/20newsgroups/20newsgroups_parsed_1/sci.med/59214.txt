perhaps
other

true
these
electric
fields
change
with
location
and
time
in
a
large
organism
also
true
special
photographic
techniques
such
as
applying
external
fields
in
kirillian
photography
interact
with
these
fields
or
the
resistances
caused
by
these
fields
to
make
interesting
pictures
not
really
kirlian
photography
is
taking
pictures
of
the
corona
discharge
from
objects
animate
or
inanimate
the
fields
applied
to
the
objects
are
millions
of
times
larger
than
any
biologically
created
fields
if
you
want
to
record
the
biologically
created
electric
fields
youve
got
to
use
lownoise
highgain
sensors
typical
of
eegs
and
ekgs
kirlian
photography
is
just
phunwithphysics
type
stuff
right
up
there
with
soaking
chunks
of
extrafine
steel
wool
in
liquid
oxygen
then
hitting
them
with
a
hammer
which
like
a
kirlean
setup
is
fun
but
possibly
dangerous
perhaps
such
pictures
will
be
diagonistic
of
disease
problems
in
organisms
