a
friend
of
mine
was
a
regular
volunteer
blood
donor
during
surgery
he
was
given
five
units
of
blood
and
after
a
suitable
recovery
time
he
went
to
donate
blood
at
a
bloodmobile
he
was
hiv
and
did
not
know
it
the
red
cross
notified
him
with
a
registered
letter
thats
all
no
counselling
no
nothing
he
died
two
years
ago
this
week
he
left
behind
how
long
ago
was
this
when
i
said
youd
get
counselling
i
meant
if
you
did
it
now
long
ago
practices
varied
and
agencies
had
to
gear
up
to
provide
the
counselling
a
wife
and
a
fouryearold
son
many
people
have
suggested
that
his
wife
should
sue
the
red
cross
but
she
would
not
she
says
that
without
the
blood
transfusions
he
would
have
died
during
the
surgery
good
for
her
what
we
dont
need
is
everyone
suing
community
service
agencies
that
provide
blood
that
people
need
testing
is
not
fool
proof
the
fact
that
he
got
aids
from
a
transfusion
if
he
really
did
does
not
mean
the
red
cross
screwed
up
prior
to
or
so
there
wasnt
a
good
test
and
a
lot
of
bad
blood
got
through
this
wasnt
the
fault
of
the
red
cross
when
did
he
get
the
transfusions

njxp
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
