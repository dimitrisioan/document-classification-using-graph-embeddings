poisoning
with
heavy

i
recall
reading
somewhere
during
my
youth
in
some
science
popularization
book
that
whyle
isotope
changes
dont
normally
affect
chemistry
a
consumption
of
only
heavy
water
would
be
fatal
and
that
seeds
watered
only
with
heavy
water
do
not
sprout
does
anyone
know
about
this
i
also
heard
this
i
always
thought
it
might
make
a
good
eposide
of
columbo
for
someone
to
be
poisoned
with
heavy
water
it
wouldnt
show
up
in
any
chemical
test
no
one
else
seems
to
know
so
ill
post
this
this
topic
came
up
on
sciphysicsfusion
shortly
after
the
coldfusion
flap
started
as
i
recall
its
been
done
to
some
experimental
mice
they
showed
various
ill
effects
and
eventually
died
the
reason
is
that
deuterium
does
not
have
exactly
the
same
reaction
rates
as
hydrogen
due
to
its
extra
mass
which
causes
lower
velocity
boltzman
constant
mumble
this
throws
various
bits
of
body
biochemistry
out
of
kilter
and
you
get
sick
and
die
ive
never
heard
of
anyone
being
poisened
this
way
in
or
out
of
real
life
the
process
takes
quite
a
while
if
anyone
wants
to
write
this
book
i
would
imagine
you
would
have
to
replace
a
significant
fraction
of
the
water
in
the
body
with
heavy
water
wait
while
normal
breakdown
and
repair
processes
cause
other
molecules
in
the
body
to
be
synthesised
using
the
deuterium
during
this
process
the
victim
would
gradually
deteriorate
and
eventually
die
but
i
imagine
it
would
take
weeks
during
which
the
poisoner
would
have
to
ensure
that
a
significant
proportion
of
the
water
the
victim
ingested
was
heavy
you
would
get
such
a
mess
of
symptoms
that
the
doctors
would
be
both
alarmed
and
confused
why
should
every
organ
in
the
body
suddenly
begin
to
deteriorate
if
you
can
figure
out
how
the
poisoner
gets
the
heavy
water
into
the
victim
in
a
hospital
then
you
could
have
a
real
story
here
come
to
think
of
it
would
continue
even
after
the
heavy
water
was
no
longer
being
ingested
so
hospitalisation
might
be
too
late
the
most
detectable
effect
would
be
that
the
victims
body
fluids
would
literally
be
heavy
water
has
a
molecular
weight
of
and
heavy
water
has
a
mw
of
thus
the
victims
weight
will
increase
by
about
for
every
of
body
water
replaced
by
heavy
water
maybe
the
detection
occurs
because
some
pathologist
in
the
lab
notices
that
the
victims
urine
is
strangely
dense
is
there
any
medical
test
involving
the
specific
gravity
of
a
body
fluid
