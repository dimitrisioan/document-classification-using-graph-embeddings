my
year
son
is
so
plagued
lots
of
vaseline
up
his
nose
each
night
seems
to
keep
it
under
control
but
let
him
get
bopped
there
and
hell
recur
for
days
also
allergies
colds
dry
air
all
seem
to
contribute
but
again
the
vaseline
or
ad
ointment
or
neosporin
all
seem
to
keep
them
from
recurring
if
you
can
get
it
you
might
want
to
try
a
canadian
overthecounter
product
called
secaris
which
is
a
watersoluble
gel
compared
to
vaseline
or
other
greasy
ointments
secaris
seems
more
compatible
with
the
moisture
thats
already
there
secaris
is
reasonably
inexpensive
cdn
for
a
tube
and
is
indeed
an
over
the
counter
medication
why
it
does
not
appear
to
be
available
in
the
us
i
dont
know
its
manufactured
in
montreal
its
a
nasal
lubricant
and
is
intended
to
help
nosebleeds
that
result
from
dry
mucous
membranes
from
some
of
the
replies
to
my
original
posting
its
evident
that
some
people
do
not
secrete
enough
mucous
to
keep
their
nose
lining
protected
from
environmental
influences
ie
dry
air
but
ive
had
no
responses
from
anyone
with
experience
with
rutin
is
there
another
newsgroup
that
might
have
specifics
on
herbal
remedies
but
thanks
to
all
those
who
did
reply
with
their
experiences
