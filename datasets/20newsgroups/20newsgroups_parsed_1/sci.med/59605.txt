partial
deletion
potentially

from
hepatic

if
i
recall
correctly
the
metabolism
of
acetaminophen
at
high
doses
involves
nhydroxylation
to
nacetylbenzoquinoneimine
which
is
a
highly
reactive
intermediate
which
then
reacts
with
sulfhydryl
groups
of
proteins
and
glutathione
when
hepatic
glutathione
is
used
up
this
intermediate
then
starts
attacking
the
hepatic
proteins
with
resulting
hepatic
necrosis
the
insidious
part
of
acetaminophen
toxicity
is
the
delay
days
between
ingestion
and
clinical
signs
of
liver
damage
this
is
not
a
nice
way
to
die
nice
explanation
except
that
it
isnt
nhydroxylation
that
causes
the
formation
of
the
nacetylpbenzoquinone
imine
napqi
but
rather
a
direct
twoelectron
oxidation
in
addition
there
is
one
school
of
thought
that
contends
that
oxidative
stress
rather
than
arylation
of
protein
is
the
more
critical
factor
in
the
hapatotoxcity
of
acetaminophen
as
far
as
drug
toxicities
go
acetaminophen
has
and
continues
to
be
one
of
the
most
intensely

excellent
recent

acetaminophen
is
known
as
paracetamol
in
europe
i
couldnt
agree
with
you
more
about
what
an
awful
way
to
die
a
toxic
dose
of
acetaminophen
causes
ive
heard
a
number
of
descriptions
by
physicians
associated
with
poison

they
describe
a
lingering
