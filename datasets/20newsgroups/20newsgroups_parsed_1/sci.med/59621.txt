is
this
a
total
or
partial
scam
theres
a
chiropractor
who
has
a
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
shopping
mall
offering
free
examinations
part
of
the
process
involves
a
multiplejointed
sensor
arm
and
a
computer
that
says
in
a
computer
sounding
voice
digitize

c
please
stand
with
spine
in
neutral
position
im
wondering
whether
this
doesnt
really
measure
anything
and
the
computer
voice
is
to
impress
the
victims
or
whether
it
is
measuring
something
that
chiropractors
think
is
useful
to
measure
