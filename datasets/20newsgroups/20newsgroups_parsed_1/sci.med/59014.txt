re
morbus
meniere
is
there
a
real
remedy
it
would
be
nice
to
think
that
individuals
can
somehow
beat
the
system
and
like
a
space
explorer
boldly
go
where
no
man
has
gone
before
and
return
with
a
prize
cure
unfortunately
too
often
the
prize
is
limited
and
the
efficacy
of
the
cure
questionable
when
applied
to
all
sufferers
this
applies
to
both
medical
researchers
and
nonmedical
individuals
just
because
it
appears
in
an
obscure
journal
and
may
be
of
some
use
does
not
make
the
next
cureall
what
about
the
dozens
of
individuals
who
have
courageously
participated
in
clinical
trials
did
they
have
any
guarentee
of
cures
are
they
any
less
because
they
didnt
trumpet
their
story
all
over
the
world
as
a
parting
note
wasnt
there
some
studies
done
on
gingko
seeds
for
menieres
to
the
original
poster
what
about
trying
for
a
trial
of
that
its
probably
not
a
final
answer
but
it
certainly
may
alleviate
some
of
the
discomfort
and
youd
be
helping
answer
the
question
for
future
sufferers
