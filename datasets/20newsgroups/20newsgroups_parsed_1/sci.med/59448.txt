could
anyone
give
me
information
on
umbilical
hernias
the
patient
is
over
weight
and
has
a
protruding
hernia
surgery
may
be
risky
due
to
the
obesity
what
other
remedies
could
i
try
unless
the
patient
has
a
very
short
life
expectancy
the
possible
complications
from
a
hernia
that
hasnt
been
repaired
far
outweigh
the
risks
of
surgery
the
risks
of
surgery
anyway
are
minimal
unless
they
are
exceedingly
large
hernias
can
be
fixed
under
local
anesthesia
dont
forget
that
hernias
are
one
the
leading
causes
of
small
bowel
obstruction
and
the
smaller
the
hernia
is
the
higher
the
chances
that
a
loop
of
bowel
will
become
incarcerated
or
strangulated
