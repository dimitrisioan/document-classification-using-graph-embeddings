when
i
was
a
school
boy
my
biology
teacher
told
us
of
an
incident
in
which
a
couple
were
very
passionate
without
actually
having
sexual
intercourse
somehow
the
girl
became
pregnent
as
sperm
cells
made
their
way
to
her
through
the
clothes
via
persperation
was
my
biology
teacher
misinforming
us
or
do
such
incidents
actually
occur
sounds
to
me
like
someone
was
pulling
your
leg
there
is
only
one
way
for
pregnancy
to
occur
intercourse
these
days
however
there
is
also
artificial
insemination
and
implantation
techniques
but
were
speaking
of
natural
acts
here
it
is
possible
for
pregnancy
to
occur
if
semen
is
deposited
just
outside
of
the
vagina
ie
coitus
interruptus
but
thats
about
at
far
as
you
can
get
through
clothes
no
way
better
go
talk
to
your
biology
teacher
kenneth
gilbert
university
of
pittsburgh
well
now
doc
i
sure
would
not
want
to
bet
my
life
on
those
little
critters
not
being
able
to
get
thru
one
layer
of
sweatsoaked
cotton
on
their
way
to
do
their
programmed
task
infrequent
yes
unlikely
yes
but
impossible
i
learned
a
long
time
ago
never
to
say
never
in
medicine
