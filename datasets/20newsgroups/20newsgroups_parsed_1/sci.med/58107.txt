this
past
weekend
a
friend
of
mine
lost
his
month
old
daughter
in
a
matter
of
hours
to
a
form
of
menangitis
the
person
informing
me
called
it
nicereal
meningicocis
sp
in
retrospect
the
disease
struck
her
probably
sometime
on
friday
evening
and
she
passed
away
about
pm
on
saturday
the
symptoms
seemed
to
be
a
rash
that
started
small
and
then
began
progressing
rapidly
she
began
turning
blue
eventually
which
was
the
tipoff
that
this
was
serious
but
by
that
time
it
was
too
late
this
is
all
second
hand
info
my
question
is
is
this
an
unusual
form
of
menangitis
how
is
it
transmitted
how
does
it
work
ie
how
does
it
kill
so
quickly
no
the
neiseria
meningococcus
is
one
of
the
most
common
forms
of
meningitis
its
the
one
that
sometimes
sweeps
schools
or
boot
camp
it
is
contagious
and
kills
by
attacking
the
covering
of
the
brain
causing
the
blood
vessels
to
thrombose
and
the
brain
to
swell
up
it
is
very
treatable
if
caught
in
time
there
isnt
much
time
however
the
rash
is
the
tip
off
infants
are
very
susceptible
to
dying
from
bacterial
meningitis
any
infant
with
a
fever
who
becomes
stiff
or
lethargic
needs
to
be
rushed
to
a
hospital
where
a
spinal
tap
will
show
if
they
have
meningitis
seizures
can
also
occur
immediate
family
members
were
told
to
take
some
kind
of
medication
to
prevent
them
from
being
carriers
yet
they
didnt
have
any
concerns
about
my
wife
and
i
coming
to
visit
them
it
can
live
in
the
throat
of
carriers
dont
worry
you
wont
get
it
from
them
especially
if
they
took
the
medication

skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
