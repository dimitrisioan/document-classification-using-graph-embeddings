sweets
syndrome
my
brothers
affine
has
recently
been
diagnosed
with
sweets
syndrome
also
called
steroid
resistant
sweets
syndrome
this
syndrome
started
after
she
had
had
iodine
treatment
for
hyperthyroidism
shed
been
reluctant
to
have
treatment
for
the
hyperthyroidism
for
many
years
and
apparently
started
to
show
exaustion
from
it
i
understand
that
she
may
still
be
testing
high
in
thyroid
level
but
shes
isnt
being
treated
by
an
endocrinologist
her
previous
endocrinologist
bowed
out
when
she
entered
the
hospital
she
entered
the
hospital
because
of
the
sweets
syndrome
symptoms
skin
lesions
ive
looked
through
the
last
two
years
of
medline
and
didnt
find
an
abstract
mentioning
a
correlation
between
thyroid
and
sweets
i
checked
a
handbook
which
said
that
sweets
was
associated
with
leukemia
id
like
a
reccomndation
for
experts
who
are
in
new
york
city
or
who
travel
to
new
york
city
for
the
sweets
and
perhaps
for
the
endocrinology
any
information
that
might
help
apparently
there
hasnt
been
much
improvement
in
her
condition
over
the
past
several
months
