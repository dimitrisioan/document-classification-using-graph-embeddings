heres
your
error
i
really
do
think
this
shows
some
confusion
on
your
part
drum
roll
please
science
isnt
so
much
the
gathering
of
evidence
to
support
an
assertion
read
hypothesis
as
it
is
the
gathering
of
empirical
observations
in
order
to
make
an
hypothesis
what
should
convince
you
or
not
shouldnt
be
the
final
product
so
much
as
how
the
product
was
made
heres
your
error
there
is
no
observation
or
hypothesis
that
is
not
tainted
by
theory
i
have
a
theory
i
make
observations
those
observations
will
be
made
with
my
theory
in
mind
yes
absolutely
though
id
make
the
observation
in
a
more
general
sense
of
all
observations
are
made
by
human
beings
and
therefore
made
with
various
biases
but
here
your
message
leaves
talk
of
hypothesis
and
gets
back
once
again
to
equating
the
business
of
science
with
the
end
result
the
gizmo
produced
science
works
very
well
at
developing
theories
within
paradigms
but
is
very
poor
at
dealing
with
paradigm
shifts
if
i
develop
a
novel
paradigm
that
explains
homeopathy
chinese
medicine
or
spontaneous
combustion
if
the
paradigm
is
useful
it
will
show
me
the
way
to
make
observations
that
prove
or
disprove
it
my
point
isnt
so
much
whether
or
not
you
have
a
novel
paradigm
but
how
you
come
about
developing
it
the
paradigm
of
modern
medicine
is
that
the
body
can
be
reduced
to
a
set
of
essentially
mechanical
operations
wherein
disease
is
seen
as
malfunctions
in
the
machinery
essentially
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
it
seems
likely
that
theories
based
upon
this
paradigm
do
not
give
a
complete
discription
of
the
universe
medicine
healing
etc
indeed
we
now
recognize
an
important
psychological
component
to
healing
perhaps
youd
admit
that
this
is
an
oversimplification
on
your
part
the
topic
of
the
philosophy
of
science
is
made
for
them
im
making
them
too
but
i
think
that
it
also
summarizes
popular
misconceptions
of
science
and
the
business
of
doing
science
biomedical
research
doesnt
make
any
basic
assumptions
that
arent
the
same
as
any
other
discipline
of
scientific
research
that
is
that
you
make
empirical
observations
form
an
hypothesis
and
test
it
modern
medicine
has
much
more
to
do
with
biochemistry
than
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
and
i
doubt
that
many
psychologists
would
appreciate
being
put
outside
this
empirical
world
view
psychology
also
has
more
to
do
with
biochemistry
than
spoon
bending
it
is
also
important
to
distinguish
reason
from
science
science
may
be
reasonable
but
so
are
many
nonscientific
methodologies
aristotle
reasoned
that
frogs
came
from
mud
by
observing
one
hop
out
of
a
puddle
oversimplified
of
course
but
a
good
example
this
is
an
empirical
observa
tion
it
was
then
tested
though
perhaps
not
by
aristotle
and
eventually
found
wanting
in
the
meantime
some
folk
will
have
continued
to
believe
in
the
spontaneous
generation
of
animal
life
theres
nothing
at
all
surprising
about
this
its
the
way
the
gathering
of
knowledge
works
there
are
probably
more
than
a
few
things
in
my
own
discipline
of
molecular
biology
that
will
be
found
to
be
totally
offbase
even
idiotic
to
someone
in
the
future
these
future
people
wont
have
come
to
these
relevations
because
they
had
suddenly
gone
all
zenlike
and
had
a
vision
in
an
lsd
trip
someone
will
have
thought
of
something
new
and
tested
it
this
is
the
bit
that
people
who
seem
to
relish
misrepresenting
science
and
research
cant
seem
to
wrap
their
minds
around
science
is
a
creative
process
what
i
think
of
as
factual
and
good
research
can
be
totally
turned
on
its
head
tommorrow
by
new
results
and
theories
again
i
think
it
gets
down
to
defining
what
you
mean
by
science
i
often
dont
recognize
what
it
is
that
i
do
and
am
involved
in
in
the
way
science
is
portrayed
by
popular
media
or
writings
of
people
in
the
humanities
they
portray
science
as
a
collection
of
immutable
facts
pronouncements
of
truth
in
big
gold
letters
thats
silly
its
as
though
we
just
go
into
the
lab
turn
over
a
stone
and
come
up
with
a
mechanism
for
transcriptional
regula
tion
its
much
more
interesting
than
that
it
really
is
a
very
human
process
