s
last
week
i
went
to
see
a
gastroenterologist
i
had
never
met
this
doctor
before
and
she
did
not
know
what
i
was
there
for
as
soon
as
i
arrived
somebody
showed
me
to
an
examining
room
and
handed
me
a
gown
they
told
me
to
undress
from
the
waist
down
to
be
exact
and
wait
for
the
doctor
is
this
the
usual
drill
when
you
go
to
a
doctor
for
the
first
time
i
dont
have
much
experience
going
to
doctors
knock
on
wood
but
on
the
couple
of
occasions
when
ive
gone
to
a
new
doctor
i
met
him
with
my
clothes
on
first
he
introduced
himself
asked
what
i
was
there
for
and
took
a
history
all
before
i
undressed
are
patients
usually
expected
to
get
naked
before
meeting
a
doctor
for
the
first
time
personally
id
prefer
to
meet
the
doctor
on
something
remotely
resembling
a
condition
of
parity
and
to
establish
an
identity
as
a
person
who
wears
clothes
before
dropping
my
drawers
if
nothing
else
it
minimizes
the
time
that
i
have
to
spend
in
the
self
conscious
ill
at
ease
and
vulnerable
condition
of
a
person
with
a
bare
bottom
talking
to
somebody
who
is
fully
clothed
does
anybody
besides
me
regard
this
getnakedfirstandthenwecantalk
attitude
as
insensitive
also
is
it
unusual
