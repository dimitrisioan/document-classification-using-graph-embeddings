even
properly
controlled
studies
eg
double
blind
studies
are
almost
useless
if
you
are
trying
to
prove
that
something
does
not
affect
anyone

the
mass
of
anectdotal
evidence
combined
with
the

a
properly

the

explanation

good
grief
has
no
one
ever
heard
of
biostatistics
the
university

washington
plus
or
others
harvard
unc
has
a
department
and
advanced
degree
program
in
biostatistics
my

has
an

biostat

there
are
plenty
of
mds
phds
and
postdocs
doing
biostatistical
work
people
do
this
for

really

people
study
for
decades
to
do
this

of

well
anecedotal
evidence
is
worthless
even
doctors
who
have
been
using
a
drug
or
treatment
for
years
and
who
swear
it
is
effective
are
often
suprised
at
the

describable

should
be
pretty
simple

worked
employed
nurses
doctors

a

phds
at

would
think
