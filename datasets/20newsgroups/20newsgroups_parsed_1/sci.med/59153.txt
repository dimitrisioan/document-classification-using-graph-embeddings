hismanal
astemizole
is
most
definitely
linked
to
weight
gain
it
really
is
peculiar
that
some
antihistamines
have
this
effect
and
even
more
so
an
antihistamine
like
astemizole
which
purportedly
doesnt
cross
the
bloodbrain
barrier
and
so
tends
not
to
cause
drowsiness
the
original
poster
mentioned
fatigue
i
had
that
too
but
it
was
mostly
due
to
the
really
bizarre
dreams
i
was
having
i
wasnt
getting
any
rest
my
doctor
said
that
was
a
common
reaction
if
astemizole
doesnt
cross
the
bloodbrain
barrier
how
does
it
cause
that
side
effect
any
ideas
it
made
me
really
bitchy
for
the
first
few
weeks
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
was
having
some
bizarre
dreams
too
my
doctor
said
it
made
him
feel
like
he
had
to
be
doing
something
all
the
time
but
if
you
keep
taking
it
after
a
few
weeks
these
symptoms
seem
to
go
away
he
said
hang
in
there
i
did
and
they
did
