re
migraine
and
exercise
jl
from
jl
i
would
not
classify
a
mild
headache
that
was
continuous
for
weeks
jl
as
migraine
even
if
the
other
typical
features
were
there
eg
jl
unilateral
nausea
and
vomiting
photophobia
migraines
are
by
jl
common
agreement
episodic
rather
than
constant
jl
jl
well
im
glad
that
you
arent
my
doctor
then
or
id
still
be
suffering
jl
remember
i
was
tested
for
any
other
cause
and
there
was
nothing
im
jl
otherwise
very
healthy
jl
the
nagging
pain
has
all
of
the
qualifications
its
on
one
side
and
jl
frequently
included
my
entire
right
side
right
arm
right
leg
right
eye
jl
even
the
right
side
of
my
tongue
hurt
or
tingled
noise
hurt
light
hurt
jl
thinking
hurt
when
it
got
bad
i
would
lose
my
ability
to
read
the
differential
diagnosis
between
migraine
and
nonmigranous
pain
is
not
always
important
because
some
therapies
are
effective
in
both
eg
tricyclic
antidepressants
such
as
amitriptyline
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
such
as
ibuprofen
other
therapies
may
be
more
specific
betablockers
such
as
propranolol
work
better
in
migraine
than
tensiontype
headache
the
most
important
thing
from
your
perspective
is
that
you
got
relief
also
please
understand
that
a
diagnosis
other
than
migraine
does
not
necessarily
mean
psychogenic
i
suspect
that
organic
factors
play
as
large
a
role
in
tensiontype
headache
as
in
migraine
