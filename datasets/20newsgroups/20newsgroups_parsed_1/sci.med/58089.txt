i
have
an
additional
question
how
long
should
a
mother
breast
feed
her
child
a
friend
of
mine
is
still
nursing
her
two
year
old
is
this
beneficial
her
exhusband
is
trying
to
use
her
coninued
nursing
of
a
two
year
old
as
proof
of
her
being
unfit
to
be
a
mother
what
studies
have
been
done
on
breast
feeding
past
a

my
wife
breastfed
my
three
boys
months
months
and
months
respectively
and
they
are
and
years
old
respectively
so
far
everybody
seems
fairly
normal
i
noticed
a
negative
correlation
with
ear
infections
and
length
of
time
nursed
in
my
very
small
sample
i
do
notice
that
the
and
year
old
seem
to
eat
a
lot
could
that
be
from
the
breast
feeding
i
dont
understand
the
unfit
mother
charge
other
than
any
tactic
is
not
too
low
down
for
some
folks
during
divorcechild
custody
battles
most
of
the
developing
nations
practice
breast
feeding
to
and
years
old
are
they
screwed
up
because
of
it
would
they
be
much
better
off
if
they
could
use
cows
milk
or
commercial
formula
