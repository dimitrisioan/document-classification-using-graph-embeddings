first
question
how
bad
is
xray
ive
heard
that
its
nothing
compared
to
the
amount
of
time
spent
under
the
sun
and
ive
also
heard
that
it
is
very
harmful
second
question
is
there
anyway
out
of
this
yearly
test
for
me
the
yearly
chest
xray
provides
a
minute
amount
of
radiation
it
is
a
drop
in
the
bucket
as
far
as
increased
risk
is
concerned
who
can
tell
you
whether
you
can
get
out
of
it
or
not
no
one
here
controls
that
it
may
well
be
a
matter
of
the
law
in
which
case
write
your
legislator
but
dont
hold
your
breath

skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
