re
need
info
on
circumcision
medical
cons
and
pros
writes
cant
imagine
what
its
like
to
have
a
penis
much
less
a
foreskin
i
guess
if
american
medicine
did
an
artistic
job
of
circumcising
every
male
then
the
visual
result
would
be
somewhat
more
natural
in
appearance
the
penile
cancer
thing
has
been
completely
debunkedshe
must
be
going
to
school
on
a
south
pacific
island
tell
her
to
check
the
journal
or
urology
for
circumcision
articles
i
remember
at
least
on
an
old
jewish
man
cut
at
birth
who
developed
penile
canceri
mean
if
the
cancer
risk
was
that
great
the
europe
who
have
been
circumcising
like
crazy
too
teaching
a
boy
how
to
keep
his
cockhead
clean
is
the
issue
a
little
proper
hygiene
goes
a
long
way
americans
are
just
too
hung
up
on
the
penis
to
consider
cleaning
it
thats
just
way
too
much
like
mastubation
so
you
have
surgical
intervention
that
is
basically
unnecessary

first
off
use
some
decent
terms
if
ya
dont
mind
this
is
scimed
not
altsex
secondly
how
absolutely
bogus
to
assume
that
americans
are
just
too
hung
up
on
the
penisblahblah
i
think
most
americans
dont
care
about
anything
so
comlicated
as
that
they
just
think
it
looks
nicer
ask
a
few
of
them
and
see
what
response
you
get
others
still
opt
for
circumcision
due
to
religious
traditions
and
beliefs
some
think
it
is
easier
to
clean
still
others
do
it
because
daddy
was
dont
be
so
naive
as
to
think
americans
are
afraid
of
sexuality
my
son
is
not
circumcised
and
i
can
vouch
for
the
argument
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
keep
clean
than
a
circumcised
kids
not
so
much
that
the
foreskin
is
difficult
to
pull
back
it
isnt
but
because
my
son
doesnt
want
to
wait
long
enough
for
a
thorough
check
for
smega
or
misplaced
feces
so
many
times
it
just
gets
a
once
over
dab
it
worries
me
that
he
might
get
an
infection
due
to
his
lack
of
cooperation
i
am
sure
however
that
he
will
be
able
to
handle
cleaning
under
the
foreskin
himself
once
he
is
old
enough
until
there
is
always
the
decision
at
each
diaper
changeis
this
the
time
to
clean
or
can
we
wait
till
next
time
