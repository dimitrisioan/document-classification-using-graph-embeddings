vitamin
b
doses
forgive
me
but
just
the
other
day
i
read
on
some
newsgroup
or
other
a
physicians
posting
about
the
theraputic
uses
of
vitamin
b
i
cant
seem
to
locate
the
article
but
i
recall
there
was
mention
of
some
safe
limits
i
looked
at
a
balanced
time
release
formulation
from
walgreens
and
noted
that
the
mg
of
b
was
some
thousands
times
the
rda
is
this
safe
also
what
was
the
condition
that
b
was
theraputic
for
mail
would
be
just
fine
if
you
dont
want
to
clog
the
net
thanks
