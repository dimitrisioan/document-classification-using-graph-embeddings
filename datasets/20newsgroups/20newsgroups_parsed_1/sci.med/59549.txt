anyway
i
am
looking
for
advice
for
the
use
of
antihistamines
as
sleep
aids
and
if
there
are
any
dangers
of
such
use
seems
safe
to
me
since
they
are
used
chronically
for
allergies
by
millions
i
dont
want
to
try
bzs
because
bz
addiction
seems
to
be
a
serious
threat
and
from
what
i
hear
bz
sleep
quality
is
not
good
whereas
antihistamine
sleep
quality
seems
to
be
better
for
me
i
have
tried
some
dietary
tryptophan
loading
stuff
and
that
also
seems
to
lower
sleep
quality
i
seem
to
wake
up
around
or
so
and
be
in
some
kind
of
mental
haze
until
or
also
i
would
be
interested
in
any
other
advice
for
helping
my
problem
although
ive
already
tried
many
of
the
nonpharmacological
solutions
antihistamines
have
been
the
active
ingredient
of
otc
sleep
aids
for
decades
go
to
any
drugstore
and
look
at
the
packages
of
such
sleep
aids
as
sominex
nytol
etc
the
active
ingredient
is
diphenhydramine
the
same
antihistamine
thats
in
benadryl
