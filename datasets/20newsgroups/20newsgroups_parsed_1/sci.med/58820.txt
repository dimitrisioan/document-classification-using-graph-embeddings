after
two
weeks
of
limping
around
with
an
acute
pain
in
my
low
back
and
right
leg
my
osteopath
sent
me
to
get
an
mri
which
revealed
a
protruding
and
extruded
disc
at
ll
i
went
to
a
neurosurgeon
who
prescribed
prednisole
a
steroidal
antiinflamitory
and
bed
rest
for
several
days
its
been
nearly
a
week
and
overall
i
feel
slightly
worse
i
take
darvocet
three
times
a
day
so
i
can
deal
with
daily
activities
like
preparing
food
and
help
me
get
to
sleep
ill
see
the
neurosurgeon
tomorrow
and
of
course
ill
be
asking
whether
or
not
this
rest
is
helpful
or
if
surgery
is
the
next
step
what
are
my
nonsurgical
options
if
my
goal
is
to
resume
full
activity
including
competitive
cycling
i
should
add
this
condition
is
in
my
opinion
the
result
of
commulative
wear
and
tear
ive
had
chronic
lowback
pain
for
years
but
i
managed
you
dont
say
whether
or
not
you
have
any
symptoms
other
than
pain
if
you
have
numbness
weakness
or
bladder
problems
for
example
these
would
suggest
a
need
for
surgery
if
pain
is
your
only
symptom
you
might
do
well
to
find
a
reputable
multidisciplinary
pain
clinic
in
your
area
chronic
low
back
pain
generally
doesnt
do
well
with
surgery
acute
on
chronic
pain
as
only
symptom
doesnt
fare
much
better
e
correlation
between
mri
findings
and
symptoms
is
controversial
don
mackie
his
opinions
um
will
disavow
