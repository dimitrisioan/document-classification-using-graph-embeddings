could
somebody
explain
to
me
what
a
centrifuge
is
and
what
it
is
used
for
i
vaguely
remembre
it
being
something
that
spins
test
tubes
around
really
fast
but
i
cant
remember
why
youd
want
to
do
that
purely
recreational
they
get
bored
sitting
in
that
rack
all
the
time
no
this
is
wrong
the
purpose
is
to
preserve
the
substances
in
the
tubes
longer
by
creating
relativistic
speeds
and
thus
time
dilatation
of
course
by
slowing
the
subjective
time
of
the
test
tubes
they
get
less
bored
which
is
probably
what
you
were
thinking
of
