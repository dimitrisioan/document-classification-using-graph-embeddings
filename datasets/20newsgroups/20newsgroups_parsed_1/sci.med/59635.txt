does
it
cause
the
body
any
harm
if
one
picks
ones
nose
for
example
might
it
lead
to
a
loss
of
ability
to
smell
is
it
harmful
for
one
to
eat
ones
nose
pickings
ive
seen
children
do
this
and
wondered
about
something
if
the
mucus
in
ones
nose
collects
filters
particles
going
into
the
airway
if
a
child
then
picks
and
ingests
this
material
might
it
have
a
vaccinatory
effect
since
if
the
body
ingests
airborne
diseases
or
other
stuff
on
the
mucus
the
body
might
generate
antibodies
for
this
small
invasion
maybe
this
is
why
some
children
dont
get
sick
very
often
tom
