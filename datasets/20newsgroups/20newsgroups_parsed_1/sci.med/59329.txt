theophyllineephedrine
and
water
bioavailability
does
anyone
know
if
either
theophylline
or
ephedrine
or
the
two
in
combination
can
reduce
the
bodys
ability
to
make
use
of
available
water
i
had
kind
of
an
odd
experience
on
a
group
hike
recently
becoming
dehyrated
after
about
hours
of
rigorous
hiking
despite
having
brought
gallons
of
water
c
liters
i
drank
close
to
twice
as
much
as
anyone
else
and
no
one
else
was
dehydrated
i
dont
think
general
physical
condition
was
an
issue
since
i
was
in
at
least
the
middle
of
the
pack
in
terms
of
general
stamina
so
far
as
i
could
tell
it
may
be
that
i
just
plain
need
more
water
than
most
people
but
i
am
wondering
if
theophylline
andor
ephedrine
might
be
aggravating
things
i
took
a
couple
of
primatene
tablets
during
the
hike
to
control
asthma
mg
ephedrine
mg
theophylline
i
gather
that
both
those
drugs
are
diuretics
so
now
im
wondering
does
that
mean
they
can
reduce
the
bodys
ability
to
utilize
available
water
would
it
be
a
particularly
stupid
thing
to
take
that
medication
during
hotweather
exercise
i
always
assumed
diuresis
just
meant
you
urinated
a
lot
but
that
wasnt
the
case
yesterday
