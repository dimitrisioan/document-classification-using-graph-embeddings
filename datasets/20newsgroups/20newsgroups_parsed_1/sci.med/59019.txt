i
think
thats
the
correct
spelling
crullerian
i
am
looking
for
any
informationsupplies
that
will
allow
doityourselfers
to
take
krillean
pictures
im
thinking
that
education
suppliers
for
schools
might
have
a
appartus
for
sale
but
i
dont
know
any
of
the
companies
any
info
is
greatly
appreciated
crullerian
photography
isnt
educational
except
in
a
purely
satiric
sense
in
case
you
dont
know
krillean
photography
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
involves
taking
pictures
of
an
most
of
the
time
organic
object
between
charged
plates
the
picture
will
show
energy
patterns
or
spikes
around
the
object
photographed
and
depending
on
what
type
of
object
it
is
the
spikes
or
energy
patterns
will
vary
one
might
extrapolate
here
and
say
that
this
proves
that
every
object
within
the
universe
as
we
know
it
has
its
own
energy
signature
crullerian
photography
involves
putting
donuts
between
greasecovered
hot
metal
plates
while
illuminating
them
with
a
krypton
stroboscope
through
a
unique
iteration
involving
the
thdimensional
projection
of
a
torus
through
the
semistochastic
interactions
of
hot
monomolecular
lipid
layers
covering
the
metal
plates
the
best
metal
is
iron
since
it
repels
vampires
and
succubi
the
donuts
start
developing
flutes
and
within
moments
actually
become
polycrenellated
hot
greasy
breadtubes
some
people
believe
that
food
is
the
way
to
a
mans
heart
but
most
psychics
agree
that
there
is
nothing
like
hot
crullers
for
breakfast
the
chemical
composition
of
crullers
is
a
mystery
some
thought
evidence
of
charles
forts
channeling
in
stevie
wonders
production
of
the
secret
life
of
plants
when
played
backwards
in
the
theatre
of
unnaturally
fertile
findhorn
farms
has
deduced
that
they
are
complex
carbohydrates
ordinarily
only
found
by
spectoscopy
in
the
magellenic
clouds
i
called
devi
on
my
orgone
box
and
asked
her
if
this
was
really
the
case
and
she
tm
levitated
me
a
letter
across
the
atlantic
to
tell
me
it
was
indeed
not
just
another
case
of
misunderstanding
tesla
though
the
miskatonic
university
hasnt
confirmed
anything
at
all
at
least
the
crullers
taste
good
i
got
the
recipe
from
kaspar
hauser

jojo

n
clean
speaking
out
to
the
way
you
want
to
live
today
american
all
american
doing
a
bit
so
and
even
more
so
