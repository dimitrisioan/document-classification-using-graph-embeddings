i
sometimes
see
otc
preparations
for
muscle
achesback
aches
that
combine
aspirin
with
a
diuretic
you
certainly
do
not
see
otc
preparations
advertised
as
such
the
only
such
ridiculous
concoctions
are
nostrums
for
premenstrual
syndrome
ostensibly
to
treat
headache
and
bloating
simultaneously
theyre
worthless
the
idea
seems
to
be
to
reduce
inflammation
by
getting
rid
of
fluid
does
this
actually
work
thats
not
the
idea
and
no
they
dont
work
i
believe
there
is
a
known
synergism
between
certain
analgesics
and
caffiene
for
treating
pain
not
inflammation
now
that
i
am
an
ibuprofen
convert
i
havent
taken
it
for
some
time
but
excedrin
really
works
