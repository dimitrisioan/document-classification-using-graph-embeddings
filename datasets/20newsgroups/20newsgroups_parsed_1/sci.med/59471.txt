my
wife
had
hives
during
the
first
two
months
of
her
pregnancy
my
son
months
old
breastfed
now
has
the
same
symptoms
she
has
been
to
a
skinspecialist
but
he
has
merely
prescribed
various
medicines
one
each
visit
as
though
by
trial
and
error
antihistamines
worked
on
both
of
them
but
looks
like
becoming
less
effective
are
there
other
solutions

food
products
can
get
through
breast
milk
and
cause
allergies
in
the
young
since
the
son
is
allergic
it
would
be
best
not
to
go
to
bottle
feedings
but
rather
eliminate
foods
from
mothers
diet
your
pediatrician
should
be
able
to
give
you
a
list
of
foods
to
avoid
good
luck
