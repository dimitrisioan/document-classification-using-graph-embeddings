my
biggest
resentment
is
the
doctor
who
makes
it
seem
like
most
people
with
dizziness
can
be
cured
thats
definitely
not
the
case
in
most
cases
like
i
said
above
it
is
a
long
tedious
process
that
may
or
may
not
end
up
in
a
partial
cure
be
sure
to
say
chronic
dizziness
not
just
dizziness
most
patients
with
acute
or
subacute
dizziness
will
get
better
the
vertiginous
spells
of
menieres
will
also
eventually
go
away
however
the
patient
is
left
with
a
deaf
ear
all
true
and
all
good
points
to
anyone
suffering
with
vertigo
dizziness
or
any
variation
thereof
my
best
advice
to
you
as
a
fellowsufferer
is
this
just
keep
searchingdont
let
the
doctors
tell
you
theres
nothing
that
can
be
donedo
your
own
researchand
let
your
this
may
have
helped
you
but
im
not
sure
it
is
good
general
advice
the
odds
that
you
are
going
to
find
some
miracle
with
your
own
research
that
is
secret
or
hidden
from
general
knowledge
for
this
or
any
other
disease
are
slim
when
good
answers
to
these
then
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
on
the
medical
problem
may
divert
that
energy
from
more
productive
things
in
life
a
limited
amount
should
be
spent
to
assure
yourself
that
your
doctor
gave
you
the
correct
story
but
after
it
becomes
clear
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
problem
for
which
medicine
has
no
good
solution
perhaps
the
best
strategy
is
to
join
the
support
group
and
keep
abreast
of
new
findings
but
not
to
make
a
career
out
of
it
well
making
a
career
out
of
it
is
a
bit
strong
i
still
believe
that
doing
your
own
research
is
very
very
necessary
i
would
not
have
progressed
as
much
as
i
have
today
unless
i
had
spent
the
many
hours
in
stanfords
med
library
as
i
have
done
and
years
ago
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
medicine
that
would
help
me
so
should
i
have
stopped
searching
thank
goodness
i
didnt
now
i
found
that
there
is
indeed
medicine
that
helps
me
i
think
that
what
youve
said
is
kind
of
idealistic
that
you
would
go
to
one
doctor
get
a
diagnosis
maybe
get
a
second
opinion
and
then
move
on
with
your
life
just
as
an
example
having
seen
of
the
top
specialists
in
this
field
in
the
country
i
have
received
different
diagnoses
these
are
the
top
names
the
ones
that
people
come
to
from
all
over
the
country
i
have
had
to
sort
all
of
this
out
myself
going
to
a
support
group
and
in
fact
heading
that
support
group
was
helpful
for
a
while
but
after
a
point
i
found
it
very
unproductive
it
was
much
more
productive
to
do
library
research
make
phone
calls
and
put
together
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
myself
a
recent
movie
lorenzos
oil
offers
a
perfect
example
of
what
im
talking
about
if
you
havent
seen
it
you
should
its
not
a
put
down
of
doctors
and
neither
is
what
im
saying
doctors
are
only
human
and
can
only
do
so
much
but
there
are
those
of
us
out
here
who
are
intelligent
and
able
to
sometimes
find
a
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
might
have
otherwise
gone
unnoticed
i
guess
im
biased
because
dizziness
is
one
of
those
weird
things
that
is
still
so
unknown
if
i
had
a
broken
arm
or
a
weak
heart
or
failing
kidneys
i
might
not
have
the
same
opinion
thats
because
those
things
are
much
more
tangible
and
have
much
more
concise
definitions
and
treatments
with
dizziness
you
just
have
to
decide
to
live
with
it
or
decide
to
live
with
it
while
trying
to
find
your
way
out
of
it
i
have
chosen
the
latter

chastity
of
the
intellect
and
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
