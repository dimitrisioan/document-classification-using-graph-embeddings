ive
already
heard
from
a
couple
who
said
they
had
it
and
it
didnt
really
help
them
i
am
a
moderately
severe
asthmatic
ent
doc
says
large
percentage
see
some
relief
of
their
asthma
after
sinus
surgery
also
he
said
it
is
not
unheard
of
that
migraines
go
away
after
chronis
sinusitis
is
relieved
did
your
ent
also
tell
you
that
this
procedure
may
remove
warts
from
the
soles
of
your
feet
and
improve
your
sex
life
actually
severe
headaches
due
to
stopped
up
sinuses
plugged
ostia
are
possible
and
sinus
surgery
which
widens
the
ostia
from
the
normal
mm
to
about
mm
should
relieve
this
there
are
nonsurgical
ways
however
to
keep
the
ostia
open
however
in
a
few
individuals
their
ostia
are
naturally
very
small
and
dr
ivkers
book
talks
about
this
the
underlying
cause
of
chronic
sinusitis
is
not
cured
by
this
kind
of
sinus
surgery
though
about
asthma
thats
a
little
more
controversial
dr
ivker
in
his
book
sinus
survival
speculates
and
says
its
not
proven
that
many
cases
of
asthma
are
triggered
by
chronic
sinusitis
due
to
the
excessive
drainage
postnasal
drip
from
the
sinuses
hes
had
many
patients
whove
found
relief
from
asthma
when
the
chronic
sinusitis
is
reduced
or
eliminated
not
clinical
proof
but
compelling
anecdotal
information
of
this
speculation
before
doing
any
sinus
surgery
first
get
the
book
it
discusses
surgery
as
well
as
a
good
nonsurgical
treatment
program
for
chronic
sinusitis
