ive
recently
listened
to
a
tape
by
dr
stanislaw
burzynski
in
which
he
claims
to
have
discovered
a
series
naturally
occuring
peptides
with
anti
cancer
properties
that
he
names
antineoplastons
burzynski
says
that
his
work
has
met
with
hostility
in
the
united
states
despite
the
favorable
responses
of
his
subjects
during
clinical
trials
what
is
the
generally
accepted
opinion
of
dr
burzynskis
research
he
paints
himself
as
a
lone
researcher
with
a
new
breakthrough
battling
an
intolerant
medical
establishment
but
i
have
no
basis
from
which
to
judge
his
claims
two
weeks
ago
however
i
read
that
the
nihs
department
of
alternative
medicine
has
decided
to
focus
their
attention
on
burzynskis
work
their
budget
is
so
small
that
i
imagine
they
wouldnt
investigate
a
treatment
that
didnt
seem
promising
any
opinions
on
burzynskis
antineoplastons
or
information
about
the
current
status
of
his
research
would
be
appreciated

theres
been
extensive
discussion
on
the
compuserve
cancer
forum
about
dr
burzynskis
treatment
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
a
forum
members
father
to
undertake
his
treatment
for
brain
glioblastoma
this
disease
is
universally
and
usually
rapidly
fatal
after
diagnosis
in
june
the
tumor
was
growing
rapidly
despite
radiation
and
chemotherapy
the
forum
member
checked
extensively
on
dr
burzynkis
track
record
for
this
disease
he
spoke
to
a
few
patients
in
complete
remission
for
a
few
years
from
glioblastoma
following
this
treatment
and
to
an
nci
oncologist
who
had
audited
other
such
case
histories
and
found
them
valid
and
impressive
after
the
forum
members
father
began
dr
burzynskis
treatment
in
september
all
subsequent
scans
performed
under
the
auspices
of
his
oncologist
in
chicago
have
shown
no
tumor
growth
with
possible
signs
of
shrinkage
or
necrosis
the
patients
oncologist
although
telling
him
he
would
probably
not
live
past
december
was
vehemently
opposed
to
his
trying
dr
burzynskis
treatment
since
the
tumor
stopped
its
rapid
growth
under
dr
burzynskis
treatment
shes
since
changed
her
attitude
toward
continuing
these
treatments
saying
if
it
aint
broke
dont
fix
it
dr
burzynski
is
an
md
phd
with
a
research
background
who
found
a
protein
that
is
at
very
low
serum
levels
in
cancer
patients
synthesized
it
and
administers
it
to
patients
with
certain
cancer
types
there
is
little
understanding
of
the
actual
mechanism
of
activity
