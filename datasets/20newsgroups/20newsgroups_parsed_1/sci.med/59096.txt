is
in
pain
from
kidney
stones
she
says
that

my
question

there
any
way
she
can
treat
them
herself
or
at
least
mitigate
their
effects
any
help
is
deeply
appreciated
advice
referral
to
literature
morphine
or
demerol
is
about
the
only
effective
way
of
stopping
pain
that
severe
obviously
shell
need
a
prescription
to
get
such
drugs
cant
she
go
to
the
county
hospital
or
something
gordon
banks
njxp
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
