re
chromium
for
weight
loss
there
is
no
data
to
show
chromium
is
effective
in
promoting
weight
loss
the
few
studies
that
have
been
done
using
chromium
have
been
very
flawed
and
inher
ently
biased
the
investigators
were
making
money
from
marketing
it
theoretically
it
really
doesnt
make
sense
either
the
claim
is
that
chromium
will
increase
muscle
mass
and
decrease
fat
of
course
chromium
is
also
used
t
o
cure
diabetes
high
blood
pressure
and
increase
muscle
mass
in
athletesjust
as
well
as
anabolic
steroids
sounds
like
snake
oil
for
the
s
on
the
other
hand
it
really
cant
hurt
you
anywhere
but
your
wallet
and
place
bo
effects
of
anything
can
be
pretty
dramatic
