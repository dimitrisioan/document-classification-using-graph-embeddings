getting
aids
from
acupuncture
needles
someone
wrote
in
expressing
concern
about
getting
aids
from
acupuncture
needles
unless
your
friend
is
sharing
fluids
with
their
acupuncturist
who
themselves
has
aidsit
is
unlikely
not
impossible
they
will
get
aids
from
acupuncture
needles
generally
even
if
accidently
inoculated
the
normal
immune
response
should
be
enough
to
effectively
handle
the
minimal
contaminant
involved
with
acupuncture
needle
insertion
most
acupuncturists
use
disposable
needlesuse
once
and
throw
away
they
do
this
because
you
are
not
the
only
one
concerned
about
transmission
of
diseases
via
this
routeso
its
good
business
to
advertise
disposable
needlesused
here
these
needles
tend
to
be
of
a
lower
quality
however
being
poorly
manufactured
and
too
sharp
in
my
opinion
they
tend
to
snag
bloodvessels
on
insertion
compared
to
higher
quality
needles
if
i
choose
to
use
acupuncture
for
a
given
complaint
that
patient
will
get
their
own
set
of
new
needles
which
are
sterilized
between
treatments
the
risk
here
for
hepatitis
hiv
etc
transmission
is
that
i
could
mistakenly
use
an
infected
persons
needles
accidently
on
the
wrong
patientbut
clear
labelling
and
paying
attention
all
but
eliminates
this
risk
better
quality
needles
tend
to
slide
past
vessels
and
nerves
avoiding
unpleasant
painful
snagsand
hematomasso
i
use
them
acupuncture
needles
come
in
many
lengths
and
thicknessesbut
they
are
all
solid
when
compared
to
their
injectionstyle
cousins
in
china
herbal
solutionsand
western
pharmaceuticals
are
occasionally
injected
into
meridian
points
purported
to
have
tcm
physiologic
effects
and
so
require
the
same
hollow
needles
used
for
injecting
fluid
medicine
this
meansthinkingtinythat
a
samll
amount
of
tissue
the
diameter
of
the
needle
bore
will
be
injected
into
the
body
as
it
would
be
in
a
typical
shot
when
the
skin
is
puntured
on
the
other
hand
when
the
solid
acupuncture
needle
is
inserted
the
skin
tends
to
squeeze
the
needle
from
the
tip
to
the
level
of
insertion
such
that
any
cooties
that
havent
been
schmeared
away
with
alcohol
before
insertion
tend
to
remain
on
the
surface
of
the
skin
minimizing
invasion
from
the
exterior
of
course
in
tcmthe
bodys
exterior
is
protected
by
the
wei
protective
qiso
infection
is
unlikelyor
in
other
wordsthere
is
a
normal
inflammatory
and
immune
response
that
accompanies
tissue
damage
incurred
at
the
puncture
site
while
im
fairly
certain
your
friend
will
not
have
a
transferable
disease
transmitted
to
them
via
acupuncture
needle
insertion
i
would
like
to
know
for
what
complaint
they
have
consulted
the
acupuncturistnot
to
know
if
it
would
be
harmful
but
to
know
if
it
would
be
helpful
