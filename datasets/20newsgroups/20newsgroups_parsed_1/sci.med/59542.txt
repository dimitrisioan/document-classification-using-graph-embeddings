reading
through
the
posts
about
kirlian
whatever
spelling
photography
i
couldnt
help
but
being
slightly
disgusted
by
the
narrowminded
i
know
it
all
i
dont
believe
what
i
cant
see
or
measure
attitude
of
many
people
out
there
i
am
neither
a
real
believer
nor
a
disbeliever
when
it
comes
to
socalled
paranormal
stuff
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
is
just
as
likely
as
the
existence
of
for
instance
a
god
which
seems
to
be
quite
accepted
in
our
societies
without
any
scientific
basis
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
a
serious
mistake
to
close
your
mind
to
something
anything
simply
because
it
doesnt
fit
your
current
frame
of
reference
history
shows
that
many
great
people
great
scientists
were
people
who
kept
an
open
mind
and
were
ridiculed
by
sceptics
especially
the
usa
should
be
grateful
after
all
columbus
did
not
drop
off
the
edge
of
the
earth
it
is
one
thing
to
be
openminded
about
phenomona
that
have
not
be
demonstrated
to
be
false
and
quite
another
to
believe
in
something
like
krilian
photography
where
all
the
claimed
effects
have
be
demonstrated
to
be
artifacts
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
to
adopt
a
wait
and
see
attitude
about
krilian
photography
it
has
been
experimentally
shown
to
be
nothing
but
simple
coronal
discharge
the
auras
shown
by
missing
leaf
parts
came
from
moisture
left
by
the
original
whole
leaf
for
example
thats
what
science
is
