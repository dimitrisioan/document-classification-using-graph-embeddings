lyme
borreliosis
negative
all
electrolytes
in
the
blood
in
their

am
not
feeling
so
i
was
also
at
a
neurologists
too
he
considered
me

shown
that
i
have
little
too
much
of
hemoglobin
common
range

i
unfortunately
do
not
know
about
the
units
could
these
hemisided
pains
be
the
result
of
this
or
of
a
also
possible

of
the
neck
