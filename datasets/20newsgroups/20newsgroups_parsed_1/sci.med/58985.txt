i
have
between
and
nosebleeds
each
week
as
a
result
of
a
genetic
predisposition
to
weak
capillary
walls
oslerweberrendu
fortunately
each
nosebleed
is
of
short
duration
does
anyone
know
of
any
method
to
reduce
this
frequency
my
younger
brothers
each
tried
a
skin
transplant
thigh
to
nose
lining
but
their
nosebleeds
soon
returned
ive
seen
a
reference
to
an
herb
called
rutin
that
is
supposed
to
help
and
id
like
to
hear
of
experiences
with
it
or
other
techniques
my
year
son
is
so
plagued
lots
of
vaseline
up
his
nose
each
night
seems
to
keep
it
under
control
but
let
him
get
bopped
there
and
hell
recur
for
days
also
allergies
colds
dry
air
all
seem
to
contribute
but
again
the
vaseline
or
ad
ointment
or
neosporin
all
seem
to
keep
them
from
recurring
