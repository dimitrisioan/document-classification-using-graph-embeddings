the
biggest
reason
why
the
cost
of
medical
care
is
so
extremely
high
and
increasing
is
that
natural
methods
of
treatment
and
even
diagnosis
are
still
being
systematically
ignored
and
suppressed
by
the
moneygrubbing
and
power
mongering
medical
establishment

very
low

precautions
only
the
one
person
using
each
bath
should
prepare
it
and
drain
it
for
at
least
minutes
after
taking
the
bath
stay
away
from

even
out
of
sight
of
other

your
greatly
expanded
aura

during
that
time
could
disrupt
other
peoples
fields
two
hours
after
the
bath
eat
at
least
ounces
of
yogurt
containing
active
yogurt
cultures
the
bath
may
kill
friendly
bacteria
also
better
yet
take
a
billionbacteria
acidophilus
capsule
which
is
also
an
excellent
daily
remedy
against
the
effects
of
aids
because
it
kills
all
kinds
of
harmful
bacteria
in
the
digestive
tract
taking
a
big
load
off
the
remaining
immune
system
because
this
external
bath
can
kill
internal
bacteria
it
may
also
be
a
cure
for
lyme
disease
do
not
take
this
bath
within
a
few
hundred
miles
of
a
thunder
storm
within

of

nor
during
major
or
minor

as
listed
in
the
solunar

published
bimonthly
in

because

the
measurable
disruptive
ambient
environmental
energyfields
present
at

times
do

more
than
four
times

miscellaneous
natural
anticancer
remedies
for
skin
cancer
apply
stabilized
aloe
vera
jel
to
the
affected
skin
twice
daily
and
take
to
tablespoons
per

of
stabilized
aloe
vera
juice
internally
for
about
months
dmso
dimethyl
sulfoxide
causes
cancer
cells
to
perform
normal
cell
functions
almonds
unblanched
unroasted
contain
laetrile
to
help
prevent
cancer
eat
several
almonds
every
day
to
help
cure
cancer
eat
several
ounces
of
almonds
per
day
never
take
large
concentrated
doses
of
laetrile
orally
it
will
kill
you
take
it
intravenously
only
cancer
cells
contain
a
certain
enzyme
which
converts
laetrile
into
cyanide
which
then
kills
the
cell
this
enzyme
is
also
present
in
the
digestive
system
antioxidants
are
freeradical
scavengers
and
include
vitamin
e
selenium

chromium

immune
against
herpes
both
types
suppress
herpes
symptoms
if
one
already
has
herpes
prevent
spreading
herpes
to
other
people
but
will
not
cure
herpes
bht
might
also
do
these
things
against
aids
which
is
really
a
form
of
cancer
similar
to
leukemia

hydrogenperoxide
dilute
twelve
drops
of
hydrogenperoxide
in
a
glass
of
pure
water
preferably
distilled
and
drink
it
do
this
once
or
twice
per
day
hours
before
or
after
eating
or
drinking
anything
else
apply
hydrogenperoxide
directly
to
skin
cancers
several
times
per
day
use
hydrogenperoxide
only
if
you
are
taking
a
good
daily
dose
of
some
of
the
various
antioxidants
described
above
vitamin
mineral
supplements
are
more
effective
and
much
less
expensive
when
combined
together
in
mega
doses
into
single
tablets
made
from
natural
sources
cancer
cells
can
not
live
in
a
strong
maxwell
north
magnetic
field
especially
if
it
is
pulsating
on
and
off
a
strong
south
magnetic
field
is
an
aphrodisiac
in
my
opinion
all
types
of
ionizing
radiation
treatments
for
cancer
should
be
replaced
with
daily
minute
doses
of
pulsating
maxwell
north
magnetic
fields
properly
made
and
operated
radionicspsionics
machines
can
both
diagnose
and
cure
all
forms
of
cancer
as
well
as
most
other
medical
problems
some
radionicspsionics
machines
can
even
take
crosssectional
xraylike
photos
of
cancer
tumors
etc
without
xrays
interferon
tablets
taheebo
tea
lapacho
homeopathy
can
cure
cancer
and
many
other
medical
problems
even
drug
addiction
mg
per
day
of
chelated
zinc
can
help
prevent
or
cure
prostate
trouble
this
list
is
not
exhaustive
the
above
natural
remedies
can
cure
both
diagnosed
and
un
diagnosed
cancers
as
well
as
prevent
them
and
also
prevent
and
cure
many
other
medical
problems
including
heart
diseases
they
are
not
too
simple
and
inexpensive
to
work
effectively
besides
acting
on
a
person
biologically
and
chemically
these
remedies
especially
the
day
fast
and
the
grape
diet
send
a
strong
message
to
ones
subconscious
mind
programming
it
to
cure
the
cancer
in
my
opinion
if
a
person
finds
out
that
she
has
cancer
then
she
should
promptly
try
at
least
the
first
remedies
described
above
in
sequence
starting
with
the
day
fast
before
resorting
to
the
unnatural
and
expensive
mutilations
and
agonies
poison
burn
and
mutilate
