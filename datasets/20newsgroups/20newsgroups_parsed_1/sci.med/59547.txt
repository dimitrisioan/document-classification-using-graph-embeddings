i
am
neither
a
real
believer
nor
a
disbeliever
when
it
comes
to
socalled
paranormal
stuff
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
is
just
as
likely
as
the
existence
of
for
instance
a
god
which
seems
to
be
quite
accepted
in
our
societies
without
any
scientific
basis
oooooh
bad
example
im
an
atheist
this
is
not
flame
or
abuse
nor
do
i
want
to
start
another
thread
this
is
after
all
supposed
to
be
about
image
processing
but
to
say
youre
an
atheist
is
to
suggest
you
have
proof
there
is
no
god
that
means
that
there
can
not
be
any
atheists
since
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
prove
that
there
is
no
god
atheists
are
people
who
believe
that
there
is
no
god
most
not
only
believe
but
also
are
damn
sure
that
there
isnt
a
god
like
