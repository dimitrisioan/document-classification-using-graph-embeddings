my
girlfriend
is
in
pain
from
kidney
stones
she
says
that
because
she
has
no
medical
insurance
she
can
not
get
them
removed
my
question
is
there
any
way
she
can
treat
them
herself
or
at
least
mitigate
their
effects
any
help
is
deeply
appreciated
advice
referral
to
literature
etc
thank
you
dave
carvell
first
let
me
offer
you
my
condolences
ive
had
kidney
stones
times
and
i
know
the
pain
she
is
going
through
first
it
is
best
that
she
see
a
doctor
however
every
time
i
had
kidney
stones
i
saw
my
doctor
and
the
only
thing
they
did
was
to
prescribe
some
pain
killers
and
medication
for
a
urinary
tract
infection
the
pain
killers
did
nothing
for
mekidney
stones
are
extremely
painful
my
stones
were
judged
passable
so
we
just
waited
it
out
however
the
last
one
took
days
to
passnot
fun
anyway
if
she
absolutely
wont
see
a
doctor
i
suggest
drinking
lots
of
fluids
and
perhaps
an
over
the
counter
sleeping
pill
but
i
do
highly
suggest
seeing
a
doctor
kidney
stones
are
not
something
to
fool
around
with
she
should
be
xrayed
to
make
sure
there
is
not
a
serious
problem
