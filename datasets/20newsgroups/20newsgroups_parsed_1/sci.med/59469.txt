schatzki
ring
pvcs
in
article
wrote
summarized
a
person
with
a
schatzkis
ring
a
membrane
partially
blocking
the
espphagus
has
worsening
dysphagia
difficulty
swallowing
and
the
doctor
proposes
dilation
by
balloow
or
bougie
using
an
inflatable
balloon
to
rupture
the
ring
or
a
rubber
hose
to
push
through
it
question
is
balloon
dilation
safe
common
and
indicated
it
sounds
pretty
invasive
end
summary
yes
this
is
a
common
and
safe
procedure
the
majority
of
schatzkis
rings
described
by
xray
however
wnd
up
being
due
to
inflammation
instead
of
the
congenital
schatzkis
ring
occassionally
a
cancer
masquerades
as
a
ring
you
should
have
the
endoscopy
to
see
if
it
is
due
to
the
heartburn
and
if
so
you
will
need
treatment
for
the
heartburn
ong
term
the
balloon
dilation
is
an
alternative
to
cutting
open
your
chest
and
cutting
out
a
section
of
the
esophagus
so
dilation
is
not
at
all
invasive
considering
the
alternative
the
second
issue
summarized
he
has
had
extra
heartbeats
for
the
past
to
years
and
once
was
symptomatic
from
them
with
some
lightheadedness
he
is
young
ish
thin
and
in
good
health
recent
bloodtests
were
all
normal
and
do
not
smoke
use
drugs
or
caffeine
etc
im
willing
to
accept
the
extra
beats
as
normal
but
dont
want
to
ignore
them
if
they
might
be
some
kind
of
warning
symptom
the
number
of
pvcs
seems
to
increase
throughout
the
day
and
with
exercise
or
something
as
simple
as
climbing
some
stairs
also
if
i
get
up
after
sitting
or
lying
down
for
a
while
i
tend
to
get
a
couple
of
extra
beats
could
they
possibly
be
related
to
the
esophagous
problems
both
seemed
to
develop
at
about
the
same
time
i
not
an
expert
on
heart
problems
but
pvcs
are
common
and
have
been
overtreated
in
the
past
my
personal
experience
and
i
have
the
same
history
an
build
you
do
related
to
the
heart
that
is
is
that
my
pvcs
come
and
go
with
some
months
causing
anxiety
taking
on
more
fluids
seems
to
help
and
they
seem
worse
in
the
summer
remember
that
a
slow
heart
rate
will
allow
more
pvcs
to
be
apparent
so
perhaps
it
is
an
indication
of
a
healthy
cardiac
system
but
ask
an
expert
about
that
last
point
especially
good
luck
hope
we
dont
die
of
arrhythmias
god
what
a
happy
thought
