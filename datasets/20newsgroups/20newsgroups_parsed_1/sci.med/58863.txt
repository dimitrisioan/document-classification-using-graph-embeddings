miracle
berries
and
the
modification
of
taste
receptors
although
the
miracle
berry
a
plant
native
to
west
africa
is
practically
tasteless
it
temporarily
changes
the
taste
of
other
substances
miracle
berries
contain
a
protein
miraculin
that
modifies
sweet
receptors
in
such
a
way
that
they

if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
chew
a
miracle
berry
and
i
do
recommend
it
for
about
the
next
half
an
hour
all
acids
which
are
normally
sour
will
taste
sweet
they
will
continue
to
taste
sour
as
well
miraculin
was
for
a
time
commercially
available
in
the
united
states
as
a
diet
aid
the
idea
was
that
dieters
could
coat
their
tongue
with
a
miraculin
pill
and
then
eat
and
drink
unsweetened
slightly
acidic
substances
such
substances
would
taste
sweet
without
providing
many
calories
a
colleague
and
i
once
spent
an
evening
experimenting
with
miracle
berries
we
drank
straight
lemon
juice
sauerkraut
juice
even
vinegar
all
tasted
extremely
sweet
somehow
we
forgot
how
acidic
these
substances
are
we
awoke
the
next
day
to
find
our
mouths
full
of
ulcers
continued
discussion
of
a
couple
