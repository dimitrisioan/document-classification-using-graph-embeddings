cortisone
shots
i
need
some
information
on
the
implications
of
receiving
cortisone
shots
for
a
seasonal
allergic
condition
ive
had
the
usual
skin
prick
tests
for
the
common
allergies
but
reacted
to
none
of
the
substances
so
for
the
last
two
seasons
ive
received
cortisone
shots
but
the
doctors
seem
reluctant
to
give
more
than
two
or
three
shots
why
what
are
the
dangers
