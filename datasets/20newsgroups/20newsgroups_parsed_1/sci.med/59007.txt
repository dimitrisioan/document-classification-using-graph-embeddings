barbecued
foods

risk
mark
mcwiggins
reminds
us
mm
also
dont
forget
that
its
better
for
your
health
mm
to
enjoy
your
steak
than
to
resent
your
sprouts
yes
i
call
this
notion
psychological
health
food
and
in
fact
have
determined
that
the
four
food
groups
are
ice
cream
pizza
barbecue
and
chocolate
ideally
every
meal
should
contain
something
from
at
least
two
of
these
four
groups
food
does
serve
functions
other
than
nutrition
and
one
of
them
is
keeping
the
organism
happy
and
thus
aiding
its
immune
system
and
i
didnt
spend
a
million
bucks
commissioning
a
study
that
told
me
to
redraw
my
silly
little
pyramid
in
different
colors
and
with
a
friendlier

rich
young
writes
of
one
of
six
impossible
things
ry
to
consume
unrealistically
large
quantities
of
barbecued
meat
at
a
time
donald
mackie
confesses
dm
i
have
to
confess
that
this
is
one
of
my
few
unfulfilled
ambitions
dm
no
matter
how
much
i
eat
it
still
seems
realistic
yeah
i
want
to
try
one
of
those
oz
steaks
cooked
over
applewood
at
wallys
wolf
lodge
inn
in
coeur
dalene
that
seems
quite
unrealisticunrealistically
small
and
a
few
slabs
of
ribs
from
the
east
texas
smoker
rip
again
in
louisville
is
not
at
all
unrealistic
either
what
say
we
have
a
recfoodcooking
dinner
at
the
moonlite
barbque
inn
in
owensboro
its
all
you
can
eat
including
lamb
ribs
mutton
for
about
we
could
invite
julie
kangas
as
guest
of
honor
and
see
if
the
moonlites
very
hot
sauce
is
too
hot
for
her
it
is
too
hot
for
me
and
i
dont
say
that
very
often
and
she
could
bring
ice
cream
with
crushed
dried
chiltepins
for
dessert
and
we
could
see
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
unrealistically
large
quantity
of
barbecuethe
owner
of
the
moonlite
estimates
that
the
owensboro
restaurants
serve
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
meat
a
week
in
the
summer
and
forty
thousand
in
the
winterin
a
town
of
or
so
two
pounds
per
person
per
week
again
sure
sounds
unrealistic
to
methats
just
too
meager
to
be
healthy
kiran
now
a
twopound
slab
of
ribs
a
day
thats
realistic
