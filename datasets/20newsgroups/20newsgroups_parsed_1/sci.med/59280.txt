use

haldol

ive
seen
people
in
their
forties
and
fifties
become
disoriented
and
demented
during
hospital
stays
in
the
examples
ive
seen
drugs
were
definitely
involved
my
own
father
turned
into
a
vegetable
for
a
short
time
while
in
the
hospital
he
was
fiftythree
at
the
time
and
he
was
on
separate
drugs
no
wonder
he
became
confused
with
so
many
drugs
it
is
almost
impossible
to
know
which
one
is
causing
the
problem
and
because
some
drugs
potentiate
the
effect
of
each
other
they
can
make
the
side
effects
all
the
worse
and
even
dangerous
kinda
like
mixing
alcohol
and
antihistamines
he
was
disoriened
the
doctors
thougt
they
should
put
him
on
something
else
as
well
unfortunately
doctors
prescribe
drugs
to
treat
the
side
effects
of
the
drugs
a
patient
is
receiving
if
one
drug
they
are
taking
causes
the
patients
blood
pressure
to
go
up
many
times
an
antihypertensive
is
prescribed
instead
of
reevaluating
the
need
for
the
original
drug
this
is
why
many
older
adults
are
trying
to
take
a
dozen
or
so
drugs
at
home
procure
a
list
of
the
drugs
your
grandmother
is
getting
and
discuss
it
with
an
independent
doc
her
problems
may
not
be
the
effect
of
haldol
at
all
haldol
may
have
been
used
validly
or
it
may
have
been
prescribed
because
other
medication
confused
her
and
because
the
hospital
normally
prescribes
haldol
for
the
confused
elderly
i
fully
agree
in
addition
she
proably
should
be
examined
by
another
doctor
who
can
reevaluate
the
need
for
the
medications
she
is
taking
i
cant
remember
the
guidelines
i
either
saw
in
a
text
or
heard
during
a
lecture
but
any
elderly
adult
who
is
receiving
medications
should
have
the
need
for
the
drug
reevaluated
regularly
if
her
current
physician
is
unwilling
to
do
this
find
one
who
will
either
check
the
phone
book
for
a
physician
who
specializes
in
geriatric
medicine
or
gerontology
or
contact
a
physician
referral
line
or
the
american
medical
society
by
finding
a
geriatric
specialist
he
she
will
more
likely
be
in
tune
with
the
special
needs
of
elderly
adults
and
maybe
can
help
