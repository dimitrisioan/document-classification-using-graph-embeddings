tend

roughly

human
glucose
whole
blood
fasting
levels
mgdl
which
are
the
strips
calibrated
for
obviously
they
measure
whole
blood
indeed
they
do
measure
whole
blood
levels
although
they
are
not
as
accurate
as
a
serum
test
done
in
a
laboratory
one
problem
is
that
cells
in
the
sample
continue
to
metabolize
glucose
after
the
sample
is
drawn
reducing
the
apparent
level
according
to
teitz
however
results
compare
reasonably
well
with
laboratory
results
although
values
below
mgdl
tend
to
be
lower
with
strip
tests
whereas
values
above
mgdl
can
be
very
erratic
what
is
the
conversion
factor
between
human
plasma
glucose
and
whole
blood
pin
prick
glucose
concentration
as
stated
above
whole
blood
levels
tend
to
be
roughly
to
percent
lower
than
serum
levels
sample
freshness
will
affect
whole
blood
levels
however
i
dont
believe
there
is
a
well
defined
conversion
factor
since
cell
metabolism
will
affect
samples
to
varying
degrees
the
serumplasma
test
is
much
preferred
for
any
except
general
ball
park
testing
