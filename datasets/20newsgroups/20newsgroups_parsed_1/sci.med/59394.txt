i
have
a
fairly
severe
high
frequency
hearing
loss
a
recent
rough
test
showed
a
gently
sloping
loss
to
db
down
at
cps
then
it
falls
off
a
cliff
to
dbs
down
from
cps
on
this
type
of
loss
is
difficult
to
fit
i
am
currently
using
some
old
siemens
behind
the
ear
aids
which
keep
me
roughly
functional
but
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
recently
i
had
an
opportunity
to
test
the
widex
q
behind
the
ear
aids
for
several
weeks
these
have
four
independent
programs
which
are
intended
to
be
customized
for
different
hearing
situations
and
can
be
reprogramed
i
found
them
to
be
a
definite
improvement
over
my
current
aids
and
was
about
to
go
ahead
with
them
until
another
local
outfit
advertised
a
free
trial
of
another
programmable
system
called
resound
unfortunately
i
was
only
able
to
try
the
resound
aids
in
their
office
for
about
minutes
and
i
couldnt
compare
them
head
to
head
with
the
widex
nevertheless
it
did
appear
to
me
that
they
were
superior
and
i
was
impressed
by
what
i
was
able
to
read
about
the
theory
behind
them
which
i
will
give
in
a
separate
posting
they
also
carry
the
widex
aids
and
had
one
patient
presumably
wealthy
who
decided
to
go
ahead
and
get
the
resound
even
though
he
had
purchased
the
widex
only
months
ago
the
problem
is
that
the
resound
aids
are
about
twice
as
expensive
as
the
widex
and
other
programmable
aids
i
could
take
a
trip
to
europe
on
the
difference
being
a
lover
of
bargains
and
hating
to
spend
money
i
am
having
a
hard
time
persuading
myself
to
go
with
the
resounds
i
would
appreciate
any
opinions
on
this
and
other
hearing
aids
and
projections
about
when
and
if
i
might
see
improvements
in
technology
that
arent
quite
so
expensive
your
hearing
curve
sounds
a
lot
like
mine
thanks
uncle
sam
ive
been
wearing
miracle
ear
canal
aids
for
about
months
now
and
i
find
them
to
be
acceptable
they
are
molded
to
the
shape
of
your
ear
canal
and
tuned
to
your
hearing
curve
they
are
comfortable
to
wear
and
almost
invisible
if
youre
worried
about
that
although
if
youre
currently
wearing
behind
the
ear
models
thats
not
an
issue
the
cost
i
paid
each
for
mine
through
the
miracle
ear
counter
at
sears
ive
heard
that
there
is
a
substantial
discount
for
senior
citizens
but
i
havent
researched
that
because
im
not
a
senior
citizen
yet
give
them
a
try
you
might
be
pleasantly
surprised
