writes
its
not
an
eyepiece
it
is
called
a
head
mirror
all
doctors
never
a
speculum
the
speculum
is
the
little
cone
that
fits
on
the
end
of
the
otoscope
there
are
also
vaginal
specula
that
females
and
gynecologists
are
all
too
familiar
with
in
fairness
we
should
note
that
if
you
look
up
speculum
in
the
dictionary
which
i
did
when
this
question
first
surfaced
the
first
definition
is
a
mirror
or
polished
metal
plate
used
as
a
reflector
in
optical
instruments
which
doesnt
mean
the
name
fits
in
this
context
but
its
not
as
far
off
as
you
might
think

these
are

not
necessarily

though
they
are
the
opinions

all
rightthinking
people
