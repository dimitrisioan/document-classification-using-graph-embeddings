someone
i
know
has
recently
been
diagnosed
as
having
candida
albicans
a
disease
about
which
i
can
find
no
information
apparently
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
bodys
production
of
yeast
while
at
the
same
time
being
highly
allergic
to
yeast
can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
any
more
about
it
candida
albicans
can
cause
severe
lifethreatening
infections
usually
in
people
who
are
otherwise
quite
ill
this
is
not
however
the
sort
of
illness
that
you
are
probably
discussing
systemic
yeast
syndrome
where
the
body
is
allergic
to
yeast
is
considered
a
quack
diagnosis
by
mainstream
medicine
there
is
a
book
the
yeast
connection
which
talks
about
this
illness
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
such
a
disease
exists
