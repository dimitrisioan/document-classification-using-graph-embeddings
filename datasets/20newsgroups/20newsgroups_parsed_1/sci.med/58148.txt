meningococcus
is
one
of
the
most
common
forms
of
meningitis
its
the
one
that
sometimes
sweeps
schools
or
boot
camp
it
is
contagious
and
kills
by
attacking
the
covering
of
the
brain
causing
the
blood
vessels
to
thrombose
and
the
brain
to
swell
up
it
can
live
in
the
throat
of
carriers
dont
worry
you
wont
get
it
from
them
especially
if
they
took
the
medication
assuming
one
has
been
cultured
as
having
a
throat
laden
with
neiseria
meningococcus
and
given
and
taken
a
course
of
eryc
without
the
culture
becoming
