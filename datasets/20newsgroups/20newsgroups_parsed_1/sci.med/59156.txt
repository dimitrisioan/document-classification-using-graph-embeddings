diet
for
crohns
ibd
a
friend
has
what
is
apparently
a
fairly
minor
case
of
crohns
disease
but
she
cant
seem
to
eat
certain
foods
such
as
fresh
vegetables
without
discomfort
and
of
course
she
wants
to
avoid
a
recurrence
her
question
is
are
there
any
nutritionists
who
specialize
in
the
problems
of
people
with
crohns
disease
i
saw
the
suggestion
of
lipoxygnase
inhibitors
like
tea
and
turmeric
thanks
in
advance
