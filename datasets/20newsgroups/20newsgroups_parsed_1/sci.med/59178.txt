i
live
at
sealevel
and
am
calledupon
to
travel
to
highaltitude
cities
quite
frequently
on
business
the
cities
in
question
are
at
to
feet
of
altitude
one
of
them
especially
is
very
polluted
often
i
feel
faint
the
first
two
or
three
days
i
feel
lightheaded
and
my
heart
seems
to
pound
a
lot
more
than
at
sealevel
also
it
is
very
dry
in
these
cities
so
i
will
tend
to
drink
a
lot
of
water
and
keep
away
from
dehydrating
drinks
such
as
those
containing
caffeine
or
alcohol
thing
is
i
still
have
symptoms
how
can
i
ensure
that
my
short
trips
there
no
i
dont
usually
have
a
week
to
acclimatize
are
as
comfortable
as
possible
is
there
something
else
that
i
could
do
i
saw
a
lifetime
medical
television
show
a
few
months
back
on
travel
medicine
it
briefly
mentioned
some
drugs
which
when
started
two
or
three
days
before
getting
to
altitude
could
assist
in
acclimitazation
unfortunately
all
that
i
can
recall
is
that
the
drug
stimulated
breathing
at
night
i
dont
know
if
that
makes
sense
it
seems
to
me
that
the
new
drug
which
stimulates
red
blood
cell
production
would
be
a
more
logical
approach
erythropoiten
sp
alas
i
didnt
record
the
program
but
wish
i
had
since
i
live
at
over
ft
and
my
mother
gets
sick
when
visiting
please
let
me
know
if
you
get
more
informative
