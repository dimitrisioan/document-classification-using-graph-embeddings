subject
old
sermon
was
krillean
photography
in
article
alexander
p
zijdenbos
writes
flame
on
reading
through
the
posts
about
kirlian
whatever
spelling
photography
i
couldnt
help
but
being
slightly
disgusted
by
the
narrowminded
i
know
it
all
i
dont
believe
what
i
cant
see
or
measure
attitude
of
many
people
out
there
i
am
neither
a
real
believer
nor
a
disbeliever
when
it
comes
to
socalled
paranormal
stuff
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
it
is
just
as
likely
as
the
existence
of
for
instance
a
god
which
seems
to
be
quite
accepted
in
our
societies
without
any
scientific
basis
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
a
serious
mistake
to
close
your
mind
to
something
anything
simply
because
it
doesnt
fit
your
current
frame
of
reference
history
shows
that
many
great
people
great
scientists
were
people
who
kept
an
open
mind
and
were
ridiculed
by
sceptics
especially
the
usa
should
be
grateful
after
all
columbus
did
not
drop
off
the
edge
of
the
earth
flame
off
or
end
sermon
we
know
that
sermon
it
is
posted
roughly
every
month
or
so
by
different
persons
and
that
doesnt
make
it
any
better
how
did
you
get
the
idea
that
skeptics
are
closedminded
why
dont
you
consider
the
possibility
that
they
came
to
their
conclusions
by
the
proper
methods
besides
one
can
come
to
a
conclusion
without
closing
ones
mind
to
other
possibilities
i
you
dont
agree
with
a
person
please
ask
him
why
he
thinks
like
that
instead
of
insulting
him
perhaps
hes
right
follow
your
own
advice
be
openminded
if
you
dont
post
a
bit
of
evidence
for
your
claims
ill
complain
that
its
always
those
neither
a
real
believer
nor
a
disbeliever
types
who
narrowmindedly
judge
others
without
knowing
their
motives

germany
the
extraterrestrials
dont
even
know
this
planet
has
native
inhabitants
their
government
doesnt
tell
them
