hi
we
are
trying
to
develop
a
image
reconstruction
simulation
for
the
skull
you
could
do
high
resolution
ct
computed
tomographic
scanning
of
the
skull
many
ct
scanners
have
an
algorithm
to
do
d
reconstructions
in
any
plane
you
want
if
you
did
reconstructions
every
degrees
or
so
in
all
planes
you
could
use
the
resultant
images
to
create
usercontrolled
animation
