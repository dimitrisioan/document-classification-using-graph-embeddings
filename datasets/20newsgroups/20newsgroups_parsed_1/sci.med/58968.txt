will
explore
the
net
wisdom
with

following
questions
is
there
any
better
way
to
control
the
pain
than
what
the
surgeon
suggested
how
long
will
such
pain
last
will
the
pain
recur
in
the
future
no
one
can
answer
that
if
she
gets
reflex
sympathetic
dystrophy
it
could
last
forever
just
hope
she
does
not

partially
cut
tendons
heal
completely
and
is
all
of
the
finger
strength
regained
how
long
does
it
take
for
the
complete
healing
process
sometimes
they
