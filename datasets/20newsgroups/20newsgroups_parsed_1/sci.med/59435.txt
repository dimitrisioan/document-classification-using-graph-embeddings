a
new
method
for
diagnosing
and
measuring
chemical
imbalances
in
the
brain
which
lead
to
alzheimers
disease
and
other
dementias
has
been
discovered
by
researchers
at
the
huntington
medical
research
institutes
hmri
in
pasadena
calif
results
of
their
research
will
be
reported
in
the
may
issue
of
the
scientific
journal
radiology
using
an
advanced
form
of
magnetic
resonance
imaging
mri
called
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
mrs
a
research
team
led
by
brian
d
ross
md
d
phil
conducted
a
study
on
elderly
patients
who
were
believed
to
be
suffering
from
some
form
of
dementia
the
exams
used
standard
mri
equipment
fitted
with
special
software
developed
at
hmri
called
clinical
proton
mrs
clinical
proton
mrs
is
easily
applied
giving
doctors
confirmatory
diagnoses
in
less
than
minutes
an
automated
version
of
clinical
proton
mrs
called
proton
brain
examination
probe
reduces
the
examination
time
yet
further
providing
confirmatory
diagnoses
in
less
than
minutes
by
comparison
the
current
standard
of
care
in
testing
for
alzheimers
disease
calls
for
lengthy
memory
function
and
neuropsychological
tests
which
can
be
very
upsetting
to
the
patient
are
not
definitive
and
can
only
be
confirmed
by
autopsy
in
addition
to
alzheimers
disease
the
new
clinical
proton
mrs
exam
may
have
applications
in
diagnosing
other
dementias
including
aidsrelated
dementia
parkinsons
disease
and
huntingtons
disease
weve
developed
a
simple
test
which
can
be
administered
quickly
and
relatively
inexpensively
using
existing
mri
equipment
fitted
with
either
the
mrs
or
probe
software
said
dr
ross
adding
this
will
help
physicians
to
diagnose
alzheimers
earlier
and
intervene
with
therapeutics
before
the
progression
of
the
disease
causes
further
damage
to
the
delicate
inner
workings
of
the
brain
dr
ross
and
his
hmri
team
measured
a
family
of
chemicals
in
the
brain
known
as
inositols
and
myoinositol
mi
acted
as
a
marker
in
the
study
in
comparison
to
healthy
patients
those
diagnosed
with
alzheimers
showed
a
percent
increase
in
mi
while
their
level
of
another
chemical
called
nacetylaspartate
naa
was
significantly
lower
indicating
a
loss
of
brainstimulating
neurons
believed
to
be
associated
with
the
progression
of
the
disease
current
drug
therapy
for
alzheimers
disease
is
widely
considered
to
be
inadequate
this
is
attributable
dr
ross
believes
to
the
theory
that
alzheimers
is
caused
by
an
interruption
in
the
transmission
of
the
chemical
acetylcholine
to
the
nerve
cells
this
belief
has
been
adhered
to
over
the
last
years
and
consequently
most
drugs
to
treat
alzheimers
were
based
on
the
changing
receptors
for
acetylcholine
physicians
have
a
real
need
for
a
test
to
differentiate
alzheimers
from
other
dementias
to
provide
the
patient
and
his
or
her
family
with
a
firm
diagnosis
and
to
monitor
future
treatment
protocols
for
the
treatment
of
this
disease
for
this
reason
we
consider
this
test
a
major
advancement
in
medicine

a
on
alzheimers
disease
what
is
alzheimers
disease
and
how
is
it
caused
alzheimers
disease
ad
is
an
incurable
degenerative
disease
of
the
brain
first
described
in
by
the
german
neuropathologist
alois
alzheimer
as
the
disease
progresses
it
leads
to
loss
of
memory
and
mental
functioning
followed
by
changes
in
personality
loss
of
control
of
bodily
functions
and
eventually
death
how
many
people
does
it
affect
alzheimers
disease
affects
an
estimated
million
adults
in
the
united
states
and
is
the
fourth
leading
cause
of
death
taking
approximately
lives
each
year
while
alzheimers
debilitates
its
victims
it
is
equally
devastating
both
emotionally
and
financially
for
patients
families
ad
is
the
most
common
cause
of
dementia
in
adults
symptoms
worsen
every
year
and
death
usually
occurs
within
years
of
initial
onset
what
are
its
signs
and
symptoms
although
the
cause
of
ad
is
not
known
two
risk
factors
have
been
identified
advanced
age
and
genetic
predisposition
the
risk
of
developing
ad
is
less
than
one
percent
before
the
age
of
yars
old
but
increases
steeply
in
each
successive
decade
of
life
to
reach
percent
by
the
age
of
in
patients
with
familial
ad
immediate
family
relatives
have
a
percent
chance
of
developing
ad
one
of
its
first
symptoms
is
severe
forgetfulness
caused
by
shortterm
memory
loss
dr
herman
weinreb
of
the
school
of
medicine
at
new
york
university
says
whether
forgetfulness
is
a
serious
symptom
or
not
is
largely
a
matter
of
degree
and
suggests
the
following
criteria
forgetting
the
name
of
someone
you
see
infrequently
is
normal
forgetting
the
name
of
a
loved
one
is
serious
forgetting
where
you
left
your
keys
is
normal
forgetting
how
to
get
home
is
serious
doctors
suggest
that
people
with
severe
symptoms
should
be
evaluated
in
order
to
rule
out
alzheimers
disease
and
other
forms
of
dementia
