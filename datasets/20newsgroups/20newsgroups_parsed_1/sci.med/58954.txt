sounds
as
though
his
hearts
in
the
right
place
but
he
is
not
adept
at
expressing
it
what
you
received
was
meant
to
be
a
profound
apology
apologies
delivered
by
overworked
shy
people
often
come
out
like
that
his
heart
this
jerk
doesnt
have
a
heart
and
it
beats
me
why
youre
apologizing
for
him
in
my
book
behavior
like
this
is
unprofessional
inexcusable
and
beyond
the
pale
if
hes
overworked
its
because
hes
too
busy
raking
in
the
bucks
more
likely
he
just
likes
to
push
women
around
id
fire
the
sob
and
get
myself
another
doctor
die
