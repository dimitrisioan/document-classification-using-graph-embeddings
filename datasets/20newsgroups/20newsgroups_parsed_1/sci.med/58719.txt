i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
most
of
the
arguments
about
science
in
scimed
scipsychology
etc
are
not
about
cases
where
people
are
rejecting
scientific
argumentevidenceproof
they
are
about
cases
where
no
adequate
scientific
research
has
been
done
in
some
cases
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
but
it
isnt
in
a
format
to
fit
doctrinaire
conceptions
of
what
science
is
here
it
is
again
this
indicates
confusion
between
proof
and
the
process
of
doing
science
you
are
making
precisely
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make
i
fully
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
big
distinction
between
the
process
of
science
and
the
end
result
as
an
end
result
of
science
one
wants
to
get
results
that
are
objectively
verifiable
but
there
is
nothing
objective
about
the
process
of
science
if
good
empirical
research
were
done
and
showed
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopathic
remedies
this
would
certainly
be
valuable
information
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathy
qualifies
as
a
science
this
is
where
you
and
i
disagree
with
turpin
in
order
to
have
science
one
must
have
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
not
a
mere
collection
of
empirically
validated
random
hypotheses
experiment
and
empirical
studies
are
an
important
part
of
science
but
they
are
merely
the
culmination
of
scientific
research
the
most
important
part
of
true
scientific
methodology
is
scientific
thinking
without
this
one
does
not
have
any
hypotheses
worth
testing
no
hypotheses
do
not
just
leap
out
at
you
after
you
look
at
enough
data
nor
do
they
simply
come
to
you
in
a
flash
one
day
while
youre
shaving
or
looking
out
the
window
at
least
not
unless
youve
done
a
lot
of
really
good
thinking
beforehand
the
difference
between
a
nobel
prize
level
scientist
and
a
mediocre
scientist
does
not
lie
in
the
quality
of
their
empirical
methodology
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their
thinking
it
really
bothers
me
that
so
many
graduate
students
seem
to
believe
that
they
are
doing
science
merely
because
they
are
conducting
empirical
studies
and
it
bothers
me
even
more
that
there
are
many
fields
such
as
certain
parts
of
psychology
where
there
seems
to
be
no
thinking
at
all
but
mere
studies
testing
ad
hoc
hypotheses
and
im
especially
offended
by
russell
turpins
repeated
assertion
that
science
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
avoiding
mistakes
simply
avoiding
mistakes
doesnt
get
you
anywhere
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects
