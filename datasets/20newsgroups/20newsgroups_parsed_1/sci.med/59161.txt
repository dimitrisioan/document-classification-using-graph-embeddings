any

of
a
sedative
called
rhoepnol
made
by
larouche
i
believe
any
info
as
to
side
effects
or
equivalent
tranquillizers
you
probably
mean
rohypnol
a
member
of
the
benzodiazepine
family
chemical
name
is
flunitrazepam
it
is
such
a
strong
tranquilizer
that
it
is
probably
best
refered
to
as
a
hypnotic
rather
than
a
tranquilizer
just
one
pill
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
side
effects
may
be
similar
to
valium
xanax
serax
librium
and
other
benzodiazepines
