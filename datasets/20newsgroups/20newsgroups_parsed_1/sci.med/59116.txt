i
recall
reading
somewhere
during
my
youth
in
some
science
popularization
book
that
whyle
isotope
changes
dont
normally
affect
chemistry
a
consumption
of
only
heavy
water
would
be
fatal
and
that
seeds
watered
only
with
heavy
water
do
not
sprout
does
anyone
know
about
this
i
also
heard
this
i
always
thought
it
might
make
a
good
eposide
of
columbo
for
someone
to
be
poisoned
with
heavy
water
it
wouldnt
show
up
in
any
chemical
test
that
would
be
a
very
expensive
toxin
