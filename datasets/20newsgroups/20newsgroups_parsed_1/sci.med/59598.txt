q
repelling
wasps
this
is
a
cross
post
to
recgardens
and
scimed
set
the
followup
line
in
the
header
depending
on
what
kind
of
advice
you
give
or
email
directly
to
me
i
have
a
problem
with
wasps
they
seem
to
love
me
last
summer
i
couldnt
spend
more
than
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
at
a
time
in
my
garden
before
one
or
several
wasps
would
come
for
me
i
am
asking
for
advice
on
how
to
repel
wasps
this
year
the
wasps
have
built
their
nest
under
a
stone
next
to
one
of
my
tiny
ponds
the
caretaker
poor
fellow
will
have
to
take
care
of
them
and
that
will
give
me
a
head
start
on
them
last
year
we
couldnt
find
any
nest
even
after
the
caretaker
has
gassed
the
nest
in
my
tiny
garden
of
square
meter
other
wasps
will
most
likely
vie
for
the
territory
is
there
anything
i
can
grow
rub
on
my
skin
or
spread
on
the
soil
that
will
repel
the
black
and
yellow
bastards
never
mind
if
it
turns
my
skin
purple
or
kills
off
all
my
beloved
plants
i
want
to
be
able
to
spend
time
in
my
garden
like
everyone
else
would
it
help
to
remove
the
ponds
and
the
bird
bath
the
wasps
seem
to
come
to
drink
at
them
and
i
suppose
that
their
prey
will
breed
in
them
the
black
tits
seem
to
be
afraid
of
the
wasps
because
as
soon
as
the
wasp
season
starts
they
stop
coming
to
have
their
bath
even
when
i
am
not
trying
to
win
back
my
patio
from
wasps
they
seem
to
love
me
the
advice
i
usually
get
when
i
ask
what
to
do
about
wasps
is
to
stand
still
and
not
wave
my
arms
ive
got
some
painful
stings
when
trying
to
follow
that
advice
i
have
also
tried
to
use
hygienic
products
without
perfumes
to
no
avail
they
still
love
me
and
come
for
me
even
when
im
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
so
far
only
two
things
seem
to
work
to
kill
it
dead
or
to
run
into
the
house
and
close
all
doors
and
windows
nb
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
bees
or
bumblebees
just
wasps

given
phenomenon
