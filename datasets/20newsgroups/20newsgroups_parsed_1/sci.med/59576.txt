re
chromium
for
weight
loss
in
article
writes
there
is
no
data
to
show
chromium
is
effective
in
promoting
weight
loss
the
few
studies
that
have
been
done
using
chromium
have
been
very
flawed
and
inher
ently
biased
the
investigators
were
making
money
from
marketing
it
theoretically
it
really
doesnt
make
sense
either
the
claim
is
that
chromium
will
increase
muscle
mass
and
decrease
fat
of
course
chromium
is
also
used
t
o
cure
diabetes
high
blood
pressure
and
increase
muscle
mass
in
athletesjust
as
well
as
anabolic
steroids
sounds
like
snake
oil
for
the
s
where
are
your
references
i
have
been
unable
to
find
studies
that
state
that
chromium
cures
diabetese
it
can
reduce
the
amount
of
insulin
you
have
to
take
high
blood
pressure
i
have
never
heard
of
this
claim
before
anabolic
steroids
i
have
also
never
heard
of
this
claim
before
sounds
like
you
are
making
things
up
and
stretching
the
truth
for
god
knows
what
reason
did
somebody
piss
you
off
at
one
time
on
the
other
hand
it
really
cant
hurt
you
anywhere
but
your
wallet
and
place
bo
effects
of
anything
can
be
pretty
dramatic
i
agree
with
you
that
chromium
picolinate
by
itself
isnt
likely
to
make
a
fat
person
thin
but
it
can
be
the
decisive
component
of
an
overall
strategy
for
longterm
weight
control
and
make
an
important
contribution
to
good
health
it
is
important
to
exercise
and
also
avoid
fat
calories
chromium
picolinate
has
shown
to
reduce
fat
and
increase
lean
muscle
i
will
not
bore
you
with
the
statistics
you
wouldnt
believe
these
anyway
chromium
picolinate
is
an
exceptionally
bioactive
source
of
the
essential
mineral
chromium
chromium
plays
a
vital
role
in
sensitizing
the
bodys
tissues
to
the
hormone
insulin
weight
gain
in
the
form
of
fat
tends
to
impair
sensitivity
to
insulin
and
thus
in
turn
makes
it
harder
to
lose
weight
insulin
directly
stimulates
protein
synthesis
and
retards
protein
breakdown
in
muscles
this
protein
sparing
effect
of
insulin
tends
to
decline
during
low
calorie
diets
as
insulin
levels
decline
which
results
in
loss
of
muscle
and
organ
tissue
by
sensitizing
muscle
to
insulin
chromium
picolinate
helps
to
preserve
muscle
in
dieters
so
that
they
burn
more
fat
and
less
muscle
preservation
of
lean
body
mass
has
an
important
longterm
positive
effect
on
metabolic
rate
helping
dieters
keep
off
the
fat
theyve
lost
chromium
picolinate
promotes
efficient
metabolism
by
aiding
the
thermogenic
heat
producing
effects
of
insulin
insulin
levels
serve
as
a
rough
index
of
the
availability
of
food
calories
so
its
not
at
all
surprising
that
insulin
stimulates
metabolism
note
that
i
did
not
say
that
chromium
picolinate
increases
metabolism
in
summary
you
need
to
change
your
life
style
in
order
to
loose
weight
and
stay
healthy
a
reduce
dietary
fat
consumption
to
no
more
than
of
calories
eating
fat
makes
you
fat
b
increase
dietary
fiber
low
in
calories
high
in
nutrients
c
get
regular
aerobic
exercise
at
least
times
a
week
burn
calories
d
take
chromium
picolinate
daily
lose
fat
keep
muscle
