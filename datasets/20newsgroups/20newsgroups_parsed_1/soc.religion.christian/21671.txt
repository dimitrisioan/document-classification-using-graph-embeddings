is
his

is
tied
directly
to
that
of
the
trinity
and
the
catholic
churchs
definition
of
it
and
belief
in
jesus
christ
is
not

a
christian
so
is
there
common
definition
of
what
christianity
is
the
basic
definition
that
i
use
is
the
belief
that
jesus
was
god
incarnate
the
belief
that
jesus
was
crucified
and
raised
from
the
dead
for
our
salvation
the
acceptance
of
jesus
as
personal
lord
and
savior
this
would
include
most
christian
denominations
but
exclude
