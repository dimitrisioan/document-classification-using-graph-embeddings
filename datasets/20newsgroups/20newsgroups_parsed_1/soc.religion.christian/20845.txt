i
dont
think
most
people
understand
what
a
christian
is
it
is
certainly
not
what
i
see
a
lot
in
churches
rather
i
think
it
should
be
a
way
of
life
and
a
total
sacrafice
of
everything
for
gods
sake
he
loved
us
enough
to
die
and
save
us
so
we
should
do
the
typical
statement
from
an
irrational
and
brainwashed
person
the
bible
was
written
by
some
male
chavnist
thousands
of
years
ago
as
were
all
of
the
holy
books
follow
the
parts
that
you
think
are
suitable
for
modern
life
ignore
the
others
for
heavens
sake
dont
take
it
literally
same
hey
we
cant
do
it
god
himself
inspires
us
to
turn
our
lives
over
to
him
thats
tuff
and
most
people
dont
want
to
do
it
to
be
a
real
christian
would
be
something
for
the
strong
to
persevere
at
but
so
you
think
it
is
easy
to
be
a
muslim
or
be
a
buddhist
the
buddhas
commandments
are
yrs
older
than
christs
and
in
my
opinion
tougher
to
follow
moreover
the
buddha
says
that
we
are
intrinsically
good
as
against
christs
we
are
all
sinners
only
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
distracted
by
meditating
we
can
awaken
ourselves
etc
etc
also
there
is
no
concept
of
god
in
buddhism
in
my
opinion
you
can
be
an
atheist
and
a
buddhist
but
to
awaken
yourself
is
no
easy
task
can
you
stay
away
from
eating
meat
can
you
sit
still
and
think
of
nothing
meditate
for
sometime
everyday
buddhists
do
or
are
supposed
to
can
you
pray
five
times
a
day
can
you
fast
for
a
month
every
year
ramzan
are
you
willing
to
give
th
of
your
income
as
tithe
muslims
do
in
fact
i
think
jesus
was
an
ordinary
man
just
as
buddha
and
mohamed
probably
with
a
philosopy
ahead
of
the
times
where
he
lived
considering
the
fact
that
christianity
is
a
young
religion
compared
to
hindiusm
judaism
zorasterism
buddihsm
it
is
also
very
probable
that
the
bible
is
merely
a
collection
of
borrowed
ideas
there
was
a
good
deal
of
trade
between
the
eastern
lands
and
the
middle
east
at
the
time
of
christ
and
perhaps
some
more
but
leave
the
crap
in
it
out
woman
was
created
after
man
to
be
his
helper
etc
aras
just
like
weight
lifting
or
guitar
playing
drums
whatever
it
takes
time
we
dont
rush
it
in
one
day
christianity
is
your
whole
life
it
is
not
going
to
church
once
a
week
or
helping
poor
people
once
in
a
while
we
box
everything
into
time
units
such
as
work
at
this
time
sports
tv
social
life
god
is
above
these
boxes
and
should
be
when
ever
i
turn
on
my
tv
there
is
this
pat
robertson
and
other
brain
washers
oh
boy
what
an
act
they
put
on
with
an
number
to
turn
in
your
pledges
god
it
seems
is
alive
and
well
inside
these
boxes
carried
with
us
into
all
these
boxes
that
we
have
created
for
ourselves
parting
question
would
you
have
become
a
christian
if
you
had
not
been
indoctrinated
by
your
parents
you
probably
never
learned
about
any
other
religion
to
make
a
comparative
study
and
therefore
i
claim
you
are
brain
washed
