subject
re
did
he
really
rise
in
article
writes
desperately
wanted
the
jewish
people
to
accept
him
as
the
messiah
if
the
crucification
was
the
will
of
god
how
could
jesus
pray
that
this
cup
pass
from
him
was
this
out
of
weakness
never
many
men
and
women
have
given
their
lives
for
their
country
or
other
noble
causes
is
jesus
less
than
these
no
he
is
not
he
knew
the
crucification
was
not
the
will
of
god
gods
will
was
that
the
jewish
people
accept
jesus
as
the
messiah
and
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
established
on
the
earth
with
jesus
as
its
head
just
like
the
jewish
people
expected
if
this
had
happened
years
ago
can
you
imagine
what
why
do
you
assume
that
jesuss
plea
to
his
father
to
let
this
cup
pass
from
him
was
merely
a
plea
to
escape
death
when
i
look
at
jesus
in
the
garden
i
see
a
mangod
who
all
his
life
had
had
the
presense
of
his
father
with
him
as
a
result
he
knew
every
detail
about
his
death
long
before
the
agony
in
the
garden
but
as
that
hour
approached
he
felt
abandoned
by
his
father
his
presense
diminishing
with
each
passing
minute
in
addition
it
was
brought
more
and
more
to
jesuss
attention
the
betrayal
of
judas
was
probably
a
big
impact
that
his
suffering
would
be
to
no
avail
for
many
people
especially
those
who
would
reject
him
not
only
then
but
in
the
future
i
truly
believe
that
the
majority
of
jesuss
suffering
was
mental
and
spiritual
while
the
physical
portion
was
only
the
tip
of
the
iceburg
btw
we
know
from
johns
account
that
jesus
shunned
becomming
an
earthly
king
from
john
joh
after
the
people
saw
the
miraculous
sign
that
jesus
did
they
began
to
say
surely
this
is
the
prophet
who
is
to
come
into
the
world
joh
jesus
knowing
that
they
intended
to
come
and
make
him
king
by
force
withdrew
again
to
a
mountain
by
himself
this
does
not
seem
like
a
man
who
would
regret
not
becoming
an
earthly
king
no
jesus
knew
his
mission
was
to
redeem
all
jew
gentile
people
and
establish
his
kingdom
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
would
believe
this
was
utterly
mistaken
much
to
jesuss
dismay
as
an
aspiration
to
some
earthly
kingdom
but
he
knew
what
his
fathers
will
was
and
followed
it
obediently
even
in
the
darkness
of
his
passion
