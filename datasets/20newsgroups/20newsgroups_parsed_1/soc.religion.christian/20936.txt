subject
poem
the
sophomore
romans
the
sophomore
says
what
is
truth
and
turns
to
bask
in
the
admiration
of
his
peers
how
modern
how
daring
how
liberating
how
modern
how
daring
how
liberating
they
chant
the
sophomore
being
american
doesnt
know
that
his
question
modern
skeptical
cynical
was
asked
before
by
a
modern
skeptical
cynical
urbane
cosmopolitan
politician
appointed
not
elected
who
happened
to
live
two
thousand
years
ago
like
many
politicians
he
cared
less
about
ideals
than
results
less
about
ends
than
means
less
about
anything
than
keeping
his
job
and
his
head
we
might
call
him
a
bit
brutal
though
firm
would
be
kinder
and
no
doubt
stalin
who
let
nobody
go
laughed
at
his
laxness
he
didnt
like
his
job
perhaps
he
no
longer
hoped
for
better
nor
feared
worse
except
regarding
his
head
and
when
these
wily
jews
with
their
headsiwin
tailsyoulose
conundrums
brought
forth
their
madman
his
first
impulse
was
to
play
the
roman
i
find
nothing
wrong
with
him
see
to
it
yourselves
but
when
they
mentioned
king
and
caesar
his
heart
froze
if
he
killed
their
madman
hed
start
a
riot
and
lose
his
job
and
his
head
if
he
saved
the
king
of
the
jews
hed
piss
off
caesar
and
lose
his
job
and
his
head
and
when
his
wife
told
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
righteous
lout
she
didnt
tell
him
anything
he
hadnt
already
figured
out
so
he
punted
not
my
jurisdiction
take
him
to
see
herod
who
just
happened
to
be
in
town
herod
appreciated
the
courtesy
but
wasnt
worried
and
sent
the
sharptongued
fool
who
suddenly
didnt
have
much
to
say
funny
how
people
lose
it
under
pressure
back
in
the
attire
proper
to
his
royal
state
his
ass
is
coveredif
herod
has
no
problem
caesar
certainly
wont
the
fool
can
be
king
of
whatever
world
he
wants
as
long
as
its
not
caesars
im
letting
him
go
he
said
with
a
shout
looks
like
hell
last
this
one
out
the
crowds
reaction
puzzled
him
they
really
wanted
him
dead
they
didnt
want
the
king
of
the
jews
they
wanted
barabbas
instead
and
as
josephus
records
they
got
him
oh
well
he
thought
they
all
look
the
same
to
me
and
well
get
barabbas
next
time
and
if
i
can
get
them
to
say
we
have
no
king
but
caesar
by
killing
a
madman
hell
ill
kill
ten
a
day
and
then
pilate
had
his
fun
a
little
joke
short
to
the
point
trilingual
and
all
this
went
as
it
always
does
when
someone
gets
caught
in
the
gears
of
government
and
theres
a
scientific
explanation
no
doubt
for
the
superstitious
rumors
persisting
to
this
day
that
it
didnt
all
end
with
a
tomb
and
a
roman
squadron
on
guard
our
sophomore
doesnt
know
about
this
he
doesnt
recognize
his
kindred
spirit
or
truth
either
as
he
admits
i
guess
we
havent
learned
much
in
two
thousand
years
fred
gilham
peace
is
only
better
than
war
when
its
not
hell
too
war
being
hell
makes
sense
walker
percy
the
second
coming
