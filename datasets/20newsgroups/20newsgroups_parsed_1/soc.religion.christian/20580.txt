i
realize
im
entering
this
discussion
rather
late
but
i
do
have
one
question
wasnt
it
a
reagan
appointee
james
watt
a
pentacostal
christian
i
think
who
was
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who
saw
no
problem
with
deforestation
since
we
were
living
in
the
last
days
and
ours
would
be
the
last
generation
to
see
the
redwoods
anyway
i
heard
the
same
thing
but
without
confirmation
that
he
actually
said
it
it
was
just
as
alarming
to
us
as
to
you
the
bible
says
that
nobody
knows
when
the
second
coming
will
take
place
