re
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
just
a
quick
reminder
the
way
you
are
interpreting
those
passages
is
your
opinion
you
make
it
sound
as
if
your
opinion
is
somehow
an
undisputable
fact
many
would
interpret
the
passages
you
cite
very
differently
many
haveseveral
of
the
great
theologians
you
mentioned
do
that
very
thing
these
were
people
who
had
much
more
expertise
in
the
interpretation
of
scripture
than
you
or
me
or
probably
anyone
reading
this
newsgroup
to
say
that
all
of
them
are
wrong
and
you
are
right
is
in
my
opinion
notice
those
last
three
words
coming
pretty
darn
close
to
the
sin
of
pride
in
the
future
i
would
suggest
you
not
be
so
absolutist
in
your
interpretations
especially
when
contradicting
highly
respected
doctors
of
christianity
