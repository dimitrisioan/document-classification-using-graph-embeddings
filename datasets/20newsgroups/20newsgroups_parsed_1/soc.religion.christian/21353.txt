re
why
do
people
become
atheists
let
me
tell
you
my
story
i
grew
up
catholic
up
until
i
was
it
wasnt
an
issue
for
me
then
i
met
a
bornagain
christian
a
very
sweet
person
not
proseletyzingsp
not
imposing
i
tried
to
get
into
being
as
christian
as
i
could
as
i
felt
i
should
but
the
more
i
tried
the
more
depressed
i
got
i
felt
guilty
for
some
of
my
own
personal
honest
feelings
i
tried
so
hard
to
reconcile
this
conflict
until
i
was
then
i
taught
myself
to
think
rationally
i
read
a
lot
of
books
pro
and
con
religion
in
general
and
specifically
catholicism
i
came
to
a
crisis
point
then
it
finally
clicked
and
now
i
am
a
staunch
atheist
this
is
a
very
loose
explanation
but
its
the
gist
of
it
now
at
i
feel
better
about
myself
better
selfesteem
a
generally
stronger
person
i
have
welldefined
goals
i
have
a
strong
and
stable
sense
of
morals
and
values
i
am
not
a
neonazi
or
a
corrupt
politicain
etc
i
believe
in
human
rights
and
live
and
let
live
among
other
things
i
am
very
antiviolent
and
antihatred
this
is
to
debunk
the
myth
that
atheists
are
depraved
religion
has
no
place
in
my
system
tough
bertrand
russell
said
that
we
can
not
know
god
doesnt
exist
we
cant
prove
it
so
in
that
sense
we
can
only
truly
be
agnostic
but
for
all
practical
purposes
there
is
no
god
