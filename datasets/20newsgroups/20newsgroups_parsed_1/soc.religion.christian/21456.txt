serbian
genocide
work
of
god
you
might
want
to
rethink
your
attitude
about
the
holocaust
after
reading
deuteronomy
chapter
on
the
contrary
after
the
holocaust
i
would
be
very
cautious
about
my
interpretatoin
of
deuteronomy
not
everything
that
happens
is
in
accordance
with
gods
will
you
might
guess
which
side
of
the
predestination
issue
i
am
on
i
will
never
assume
that
evil
is
punishment
by
god
especially
when
i
am
speaking
of
the
evil
that
falls
on
someone
else
for
my
own
life
i
will
work
to
discern
the
hand
of
god
in
the
evil
that
befalls
me
see
the
discussion
earlier
