hi
i
am
new
to
this
newsgroup
and
also
fairly
new
to
christianity
i
realize
i
am
very
ignorant
about
much
of
the
bible
and
quite
possibly
about
what
christians
should
hold
as
true
this
i
am
trying
to
rectify
by
reading
the
bible
of
course
but
it
would
be
helpful
to
also
read
a
good
interpretationcommentary
on
the
bible
or
other
relevant
aspects
of
the
christian
faith
one
of
my
questions
i
would
like
to
ask
is
can
anyone
recommend
a
good
reading
list
of
theological
works
intended
for
a
lay
person
id
recommend
mcdowells
evidence
that
demands
a
verdict
books
i
think
and
manfred
brauchs
hard
sayings
of
paul
he
also
may
have
done
hard
sayings
of
jesus
my
focus
would
be
for
a
new
christian
to
struggle
with
his
faith
and
be
encouraged
by
the
historical
evidence
especially
one
who
comes
from
a
background
which
emphasizes
knowable
faith
