hate
the
sin
but
love
the
sinnerive
heard
that
quite
a
bit
recently
often
in
the
context
of
discussions
about
christianity
and
homosexuality
but
the
context
really
isnt
that
important
my
question
is
whether
that
statement
is
consistent
with
christianity
i
would
think
not
im
very
grateful
for
scotts
reflections
on
this
oftquoted
phrase
could
someone
please
remind
me
of
the
scriptural
source
for
it
rom
doesnt
count
kids
the
manner
in
which
this
little
piece
of
conventional
wisdom
is
applied
has
in
my
experience
been
uniformly
hateful
and
destructive
billh

yes
those
who
apply
it
hatefully
would
be
better
served
if
they
if
they
could
alter
the
bible
to
reflect
their
views
scene
a
well
in
samaria
woman
but
i
have
no
husband
jesus
yo
everybody
listen
up
get
your
rocks
ready
well
have
some
good
biblical
fun
here
she
is
whispering
to
me
that
she
doesnt
have
a
husband
yet
i
know
by
my
secret
powers
that
she
has
had
five
of
them
you
know
how
these
samaritans
are
and
worse
shes
living
with
a
guy
now
that
shes
not
even
married
to
now
i
believe
in
loving
her
and
if
youll
just
raise
up
those
rocks
like
the
bible
allows
and
threaten
her
with
a
good
stoning
shell
understand
how
much
we
hate
the
sin
but
love
the
sinner
we
must
keep
our
priorities
strait
lest
folks
years
from
now
misunderstand
me
and
believe
i
canceled
all
sin
scene
golgatha
nd
thief
you
got
a
raw
deal
man
they
didnt
catch
you
doing
anything
wrong
like
they
caught
me
bleeding
jesus
now
son
let
me
be
real
clear
you
say
you
did
something
wrong
but
are
you
repenting
i
need
to
be
absolutely
certain
cause
if
you
repent
i
have
a
nice
room
for
you
in
heaven
but
if
you
think
you
might
go
thieving
again
i
have
to
cancel
your
reservation
it
is
nice
of
you
to
have
pity
on
me
while
im
hanging
here
but
you
must
understand
this
is
all
an
act
im
not
really
hurting
im
god
you
see
and
the
point
of
all
this
is
to
teach
you
to
be
perfect
like
me
if
you
think
a
simple
kind
remark
to
me
in
suffering
is
going
to
get
you
any
favors
youd
better
think
twice
but
if
you
will
just
repent
you
will
become
a
fundelical
in
good
standing
from
all
such
bad
news
you
have
delivered
us
good
god
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
