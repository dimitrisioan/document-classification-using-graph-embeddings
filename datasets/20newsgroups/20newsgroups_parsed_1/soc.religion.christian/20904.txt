writes
probably
a
tired
old
horse
but
maybe
with
a
slightly
different
twist
i
wanted
to
know
if
there
are
any
good
englishlanguage
texts
for
learning
ancient
hebrew
and
how
these
compare
with
german
educational
texts
qualitywise
if
anybody
has
an
idea
i
cant
figure
out
if
i
should
buy
one
here
for
later
study
or
wait
until
i
get
back
to
the
us
my
impression
is
that
for
advanced
work
you
will
be
much
better
off
with
german
reference
works
lexicons
concordances
especially
for
a
firsttime
encounter
my
personal
preference
would
be
to
deal
with
a
textbook
written
in
my
native
language
but
if
you
know
german
and
are
in
germany
pick
up
all
the
reference
books
you
think
you
can
handle
i
only
know
these
works
by
reputation
since
my
german
is
most
rusty
but
id
look
at
the
following
books
koehlers
lexicon
mandelderns
concordance
the
jenni
westermann
theological
dictionary
of
the
ot
whats
it
like
at
divinity
schools
or
seminaries
in
the
states
is
there
a
lot
of
language
instruction
done
i
really
dont
have
a
basis
for
comparison
the
amount
of
language
instruction
available
at
us
seminaries
varies
widely
mostly
depending
on
the
denominational
heritage
of
the
school
presbyterian
and
reformed
seminaries
probably
place
a
lot
more
emphasis
on
the
biblical
languages
than
others
of
course
any
divinity
school
that
has
a
doctoral
program
in
biblical
studies
is
going
to
have
extensive
language
resources
but
there
are
quite
a
few
mastersdegreegranting
seminaries
here
at
which
the
attitude
seems
to
be
more
well
if
youre
really
interested
well
give
you
a
semesterlong
course
but
we
dont
understand
why
the
pattern
here
at
the
louisville
presbyterian
seminary
is
for
firstyear
students
to
take
intensive
fiveweek
introductory
language
courses
in
each
language
followed
by
semesterlong
exegesis
courses
that
is
hebrew
in
august
ot
exegesis
in
the
fall
greek
in
january
nt
exegesis
in
the
spring
these
courses
are
required
for
graduation
a
third
or
a
half
of
the
students
id
say
take
advanced
biblical
work
that
requires
language
work
