you
might
visit
some
congregations
of
christians
who
happen
to
be
homosexuals
that
are
spiritfilled
believers
not
mccrs
before
you
go
lumping
us
all
together
with
troy
perry
gee
i
think
there
are
some
real
criminals
robbers
muderers
drug
addicts
who
appear
to
be
fun
loving
caring
people
too
so
whats
your
point
is
it
ok
just
because
the
people
are
nice
isnt
satan
having
a
hayday
pitting
christian
against
christian
over
any
issue
he
can
especially
homosexuality
lets
reach
the
homosexuals
for
christ
lets
not
try
to
change
them
just
need
to
bring
them
to
christ
if
he
doesnt
want
them
to
be
gay
he
can
change
that
if
they
are
living
a
moral
life
committed
to
someone
of
the
same
sex
and
god
is
moving
in
their
lives
who
are
we
to
tell
them
they
have
to
change
i
think
the
old
saying
hate
the
sin
and
not
the
sinner
is
appropriate
here
many
who
belive
homosexuality
is
wrong
probably
dont
hate
the
people
i
dont
i
dont
hate
my
kids
when
they
do
wrong
either
but
i
tell
them
what
is
right
and
if
they
lie
or
dont
admit
they
are
wrong
or
just
dont
make
an
effort
to
improve
or
repent
they
get
punished
i
think
this
is
quite
appropriate
you
may
want
to
be
careful
about
how
you
think
satan
is
working
here
maybe
he
is
trying
to
destroy
our
sense
of
right
and
wrong
through
feel
goodism
maybe
he
is
trying
to
convince
you
that
you
know
more
than
god
kind
of
like
the
adam
and
eve
story
read
it
and
compare
it
to
todays
mentality
you
may
be
suprised
