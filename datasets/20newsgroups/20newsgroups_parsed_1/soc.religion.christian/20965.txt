some
questions
from
a
new
christian
in
a
previous
article
steven
r
hoskins
writes
one
of
my
questions
i
would
like
to
ask
is
can
anyone
recommend
a
good
reading
list
of
theological
works
intended
for
a
lay
person
i
would
recommend
essential
truthes
of
the
christian
faith
by
rc
sproul
it
is
copywrited
from
tyndale
house
publishers
sproul
offers
concise
explanations
in
simple
language
of
around
different
christian
doctrines
grouped
by
subject
i
think
it
would
be
particularly
good
for
newer
christians
and
older
christians
suffering
spiritual
malnutrition
as
it
gives
a
biblically
sound
basic
treatment
of
the
issues
avoiding
long
indepth
analysis
that
can
wait
until
after
you
know
the
basics

he
is
no

what
he

not
keep
to
gain
what
he
can
not
lose
