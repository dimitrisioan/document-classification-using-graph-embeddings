the
only

death
penalty
is
revenge

you
are

try

a
position
try
to
refute
the
whole
position
or
acknosledge
that
you
are
only
speaking
to
small
piece
of
the
problem
broad
sweeping
the
only
reason
etc
on
as
tough
nut
to
crack
as
the
death
penalty
reallly
doesnt
help
much
every
year
the
fbi
releases
crime
stats
showing
an
overwhelming
amount
of
crime
is
committed
by
repeat
offenders
people
are
killed
by
folks
who
have
killed
who
knows
how
many
times
before
how
aobut
folks
who
are
for
the
death
penalty
not
for
revenge
but
to
cut
down
on
recidivism
your
point
is
well
taken
i
acknowledge
the
fact
that
there
are
some
who
take
this
position
sorry
about
that
of
course
i
still
believe
that
the
vast
majority
of
those
who
favor
the
death
penalty
do
so
for
reason
of
seeking
vengeance
im
curious
if
you
favor
the
death
penalty
to
keep
killers
from
killing
again
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
with
people
who
commit
other
crimes
such
as
rape
or
robbery
isnt
it
the
muslims
who
cut
your
hand
off
if
youre
caught
stealing
