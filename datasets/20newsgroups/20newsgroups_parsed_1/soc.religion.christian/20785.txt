i
would
like
to
get
your
opinions
on
this
when
exactly
does
an
engaged
couple
become
married
in
gods
eyes
some
say
that
if
the
two
have
publically
announced
their
plans
to
marry
have
made
their
vows
to
god
and
are
unswervingly
committed
to
one
another
i
realize
this
is
a
subjective
qualifier
they
are
marriedjoined
in
gods
sight
the
way
i
read
scripture
a
couple
becomes
married
when
they
are
physically
married
ie
when
they
first
have
sexual
intercourse
some
years
ago
an
anglican
synod
was
discussing
the
marriage
canons
and
there
was
some
debate
on
what
actually
constituted
a
marriage
the
bishop
of
natal
whose
wife
of
many
years
had
died
and
who
had
recently
remarried
announced
it
must
be
consummated
and
looked
like
that
cat
that
got
the
cream
so
i
suppose
he
at
least
would
agree
with
you
