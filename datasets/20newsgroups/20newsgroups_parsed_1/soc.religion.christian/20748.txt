those
who
have
an
empty
spot
in
the
godshaped
hole
in
their
hearts
must
do
something
to
ease
the
pain
i
have
heard
this
claim
quite
a
few
times
does
anybody
here
know
who
first
came
up
with
the
godshaped
hole
business
was
it
pascal
or
maybe
descartes
who
first
used
this
figure
of
speech
i
seem
to
have
some
vague
recollections
from
reading
some
of
their
essays
but
i
certainly
couldnt
say
it
was
one
of
them
