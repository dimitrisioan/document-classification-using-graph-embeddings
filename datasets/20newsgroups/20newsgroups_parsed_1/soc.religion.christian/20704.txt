we
also
can
not
fail
to
note
the
intense
suffering
a
devastation
which
has
been
wrecked
on
our
world
because
of
christians
who
were
certain
they
were
following
christ
from
captialist
in
strict
obedience
to
the
gensis
innocent
women
who
were
burned
alive
in
accordance
with
you
shall
not
allow
a
witch
to
live
the
moslems
who
were
killed
in
the
crusades
the
godfearing
men
destroyed
by
the
inquistion
the
religious
wars
in
spain
france
england
etc
christianity
has
undoubtedly
caused
the
most
suffering
and
needless
loss
of
life
by
individuals
whose
certainity
that
they
were
following
the
instructions
therein
was
unquestionable
there
is
much
to
grieve
i
agree
where
in
the
gospels
does
jesus
advocate
any
of
the
actions
you
mention
i
couldnt
find
witch
or
sorceress
in
my
concordance
is
there
something
in
the
epistles
about
witches
im
still
working
my
way
through
the
gospels
jj

reference
is
ex
its
