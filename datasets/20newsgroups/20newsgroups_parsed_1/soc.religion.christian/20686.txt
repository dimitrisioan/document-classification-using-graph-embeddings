subject
prayers
and
advice
requested
on
family
problem
my
brother
has
been
alienated
from
my
parents
and
me
since
shortly
after
his
marriage
to
a
domineering
and
insecure
woman
about
twelve
years
ago
weve
kept
things
on
a
painfully
polite
christmascard
sort
of
level
for
most
of
this
time
attempts
to
see
each
other
end
disastrously
with
his
wife
throwing
a
screaming
fit
and
storming
out
over
either
our
imagined
slights
to
her
or
his
inattention
or
insensitivity
to
her
i
mean
thisll
happen
by
the
end
of
a
single
restaurant
meal
he
seems
from
what
ive
seen
to
live
in
a
state
of
quivering
anxiety
hoping
futilely
to
keep
the
next
storm
from
breaking
he
has
sacrificed
not
only
meaningful
contact
with
us
but
also
other
friends
and
outside
interests
now
this
is
his
choice
and
i
need
to
accept
it
even
if
i
deplore
it
but
its
hard
from
time
to
time
ive
wanted
to
drop
the
pretense
that
we
have
a
relationshipby
cutting
off
contactor
trying
to
have
a
real
if
painful
relationship
by
talking
honestly
with
him
but
ive
always
thought
why
be
dramatic
and
you
know
hell
only
get
evasive
and
then
find
some
excuse
to
get
off
the
phone
just
leave
the
door
open
in
case
he
ever
decides
to
come
back
its
been
an
unsatisfying
choice
to
allow
us
to
go
on
with
the
superficial
trappings
of
a
relationship
but
it
was
the
best
i
could
think
of
now
this
weekend
my
mother
finally
decided
that
she
wasnt
going
to
pretend
any
more
and
has
cut
off
relations
with
them
this
was
the
outcome
of
a
phone
conversation
in
which
my
sisterinlaw
screamed
and
raved
at
my
mother
blaming
her
for
everything
wrong
in
their
lives
and
in
which
my
brother
evaded
temporized
claimed
the
situation
was
beyond
his
control
and
as
always
expected
my
mother
to
make
all
the
allowances
and
concessions
mom
said
she
would
not
that
she
would
not
quietly
take
abuse
any
more
and
that
if
these
were
the
terms
of
their
relationship
she
didnt
want
to
talk
to
or
see
them
any
more
and
she
hung
up
i
have
never
seem
my
mother
lose
her
temper
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
first
time
shes
ever
hung
up
on
someone
mom
says
she
feels
as
if
shes
divorced
my
brother
and
that
its
a
relief
in
some
ways
to
have
the
break
out
in
the
open
and
done
with
i
have
mixed
feelings
im
proud
of
mom
for
sticking
up
for
herself
angry
at
my
brother
and
sisterinlaw
for
hurting
her
for
being
jerks
for
persisting
in
such
a
wretched
life
which
hurts
us
all
and
is
warping
their
children
angry
at
my
sisterinlaw
for
being
so
hateful
and
angry
at
my
brother
for
being
a
coward
and
having
so
little
respect
for
himself
or
us
that
hes
willing
to
throw
us
aside
and
use
up
all
his
energy
trying
to
appease
an
unappeasable
emotionally
disturbed
woman
pained
for
their
children
who
are
a
mess
scared
for
the
future
since
this
marks
the
time
when
either
things
will
change
and
improve
or
the
break
will
become
irrevocable
nastily
self
righteous
over
this
bit
of
proof
that
they
cant
get
away
with
treating
us
or
each
other
this
way
and
then
disgusted
with
myself
for
even
beginning
to
gloat
over
others
misery
and
finally
mostly
sad
sad
sad
to
see
my
parents
hurt
and
my
brother
and
sisterinlaw
trapped
in
a
horrible
destructive
situation
that
they
cant
see
a
way
out
ofor
they
cant
bear
to
take
whatever
paths
they
do
see
and
im
frustrated
because
i
dont
know
what
if
anything
to
do
and
doing
nothing
drives
me
up
the
wall
i
try
to
pray
about
my
own
feelings
of
rage
impotence
and
vindictiveness
and
about
their
situation
but
i
am
not
free
of
the
desire
to
do
something
concrete
the
desire
to
do
something
to
define
a
problem
and
fix
it
is
one
of
my
besetting
vices
im
having
a
terrible
time
quieting
down
my
internal
mental
chatter
enough
to
listen
for
god
do
you
thoughtful
and
kind
people
on
the
net
have
advice
for
me
is
this
a
time
to
reach
out
to
my
brother
to
let
things
be
how
can
i
conquer
my
rage
at
him
enough
to
be
there
for
him
heres
the
big
question
ive
been
evading
throughout
this
long
long
post
is
it
ok
as
a
christian
and
a
proponent
of
faith
hope
and
charity
to
accept
the
destruction
of
a
relationship
to
give
up
on
my
own
brother
or
at
least
to
accept
that
i
am
powerless
to
help
him
and
can
only
wait
and
see
what
happens
do
please
answerby
email
or
post
thank
you
julie
