major
views
of

trinity
second
century
the
writers
of
the
nd
cent
are
important
because
they
set
up
much
of
the
context
for
the
later
discussions
justin
martyr
aristides
athenagoras
tatian
and
theophilus
of
antioch
are
known
as
the
apologists
their
theology
has
often
been
described
as
logos
theology
based
strongly
on
wording
in
john
they
took
more
or
less
a
twophase
approach
through
eternity
the
logos
was
with
the
father
as
his
mind
or
thought
this
immanent
word
became
expressed
as
god
revealed
himself
in
history
ultimately
in
jesus
thus
jesus
full
distinction
from
the
father
only
became
visible
in
history
though
the
logos
had
been
present
in
god
from
eternity
rusch
regards
this
view
is
containing
many
of
the
emphases
of
the
final
orthodox
position
but
in
a
form
which
is
less
sophisticated
because
it
did
not
have
the
technical
language
to
properly
deal
with
the
eternal
plurality
in
the
godhead
irenaeus
held
views
somewhat
similar
to
the
apologists
however
he
was
uncomfortable
with
the
twostage
approach
he
still
viewed
god
as
one
personage
with
distinctions
that
did
not
become
fully
visible
except
through
his
process
of
selfrevelation
the
economy
the
distinctions
are
present
in
his
essential
nature
irenaeus
emphasized
the
holy
spirit
more
than
the
apologists
irenaeus
views
should
probably
be
called
economic
trinitarianism

term
is
normally
used

a
development

with
them
the
threeness
is
visible
primarily
in
the
various
ways
that
god
revealed
himself
in

however
they
did

that
this
is
a
manifestation

the

as
a

there

will
haunt

centuries

the

is
intrinsic
to
his
concept

the
father
and
son
are
described
as
separate
hypostases
though
this
may
not
have
quite
the
meaning
of
separate
subsistence
that
it
had
in
some
contexts
the
union
is
one
of
love
and
action

there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
he
may
have
used
the
