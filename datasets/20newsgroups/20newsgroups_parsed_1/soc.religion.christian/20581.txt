does
god
love
you

however
gods
love
is
qualified
the
bible
says
the
way
of
the
wicked
is
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
but
he
loveth
him
that
followeth
after
righteousness
proverbs
for
the
lord
knoweth
the
way
of
the
righteous
but
the
way
of
the
ungodly
shall
perish
psalm
i
am
extremely
uncomfortable
with
this
way
of
phrasing
it
gods
love
is
unconditional
unqualified
unfathomable
we
are
capable
of
rejecting
gods
love
but
he
never
fails
to
love
us
these
verses
do
not
show
that
gods
love
is
qualified
but
rather
that
he
is
opposed
to
evil
i
am
uncomfortable
with
the
tract
in
general
because
there
seems
to
be
an
innappropriate
emphasis
on
hell
god
deserves
our
love
and
worship
because
of
who
he
is
i
do
not
like
the
idea
of
frightening
people
into
accepting
christ
i
see
evangelism
as
combining
a
way
of
living
that
shows
gods
love
with
putting
into
words
and
explaining
that
love
preaching
the
gospel
without
living
the
gospel
is
no
better
than
being
a
noisy
gong
or
a
clanging
cymbal
heres
a
question
how
many
of
you
are
christians
because
you
are
afraid
of
going
to
hell
how
many
are
responding
to
gods
love
