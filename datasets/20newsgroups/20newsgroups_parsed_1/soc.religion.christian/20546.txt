paul
hudson
jr
writes
biblical
prophecy
tends
to
be
somewhat
cyclical
for
example
the
virgin
prophecy
of
isaiah
also
prophecied
of
christ
how
does
this
apply
to
the
book
of
revelation
in
regard
to
the
perterist
view
much
of
the
ot
prophecies
have
a
double
application
to
the
jewish
captivity
and
to
the
end
of
time
but
if
rev
is
dated
at
ad
its
prophecies
could
not
apply
to
the
ad
destructioin
of
jerusalem
darius
