im
concerned
about
a
recent
posting
about
wbtsil
i
thought
theyd
pretty
much
been
denounced
as
a
rightwing
organization
involved
in
ideological
manipulation
and
cultural
interference
good
heavens
you
mean
my
good
friend
wes
collins
who
took
his
wife
and
two
small
children
into
the
jungles
of
guatemala
despite
dangers
from
primitive
conditions
and
armed
guerillas
so
that
the
indigenous
people
groups
their
could
have
the
bible
in
their
native
languagesthe
young
man
who
led
bible
studies
in
our
church
who
daily
demonstrated
and
declared
his
deep
abiding
faith
in
the
lord
of
loveyou
mean
he
really
was
a
sneaky
imperialistic
spy
i
am
sorry
you
find
these
charges
amusing
mark
i
understand
your
frustration
thoughit
can
be
kind
of
scary
to
find
your
assumptions
challenged
some
of
the
specific
cultural
interference
to
which
i
refer
includes
linguistic
manipulation
for
instance
their
tzotzilspanish
dictionary
removed
both
spanish
and
tzotzil
words
for
concepts
which
are
threatening
to
the
ruling
ideology
eg
class
conquer
exploitation
repression
revolution
and
described
words
which
can
express
ideological
concepts
in
examples
like
bossthe
boss
is
good
he
treats
us
well
and
pays
us
a
good
wage
as
some
of
my
students
would
say
not
your
tone
implies
that
you
are
unlikely
to
believe
meindeed
why
should
you
if
you
are
interested
enough
to
do
some
further
research
though
and
you
sound
as
if
you
are
here
are
some
references

you
