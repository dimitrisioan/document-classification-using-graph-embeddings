point
today
might
be
the
masons
just
a
note
that
they
too
worshipped
osiris
in
egypt
much
deleted
it
bugs
me
when
i
see
this
kind
of
nonsense
first
there
is
no
reasonable
evidence
linking
masonry
to
ancient
egypt
or
even
that
it
existed
prior
to
the
late
th
century
and
theres
nothing
definitive
before
the
th
im
going
to
cut
rexs
ramblings
down
a
bit
you
must
not
be
past
your
th
level
you
should
read
wilkinsons
egyptians
and
how
he
shows
this
egyptian
religion
paralleling
his
own
british
masonry
there
is
a
man
here
at
this
laboratory
who
is
a
degree
black
mason
ive
talked
with
him
there
is
the
public
side
with
motorcyle
mania
and
childrens
hospitals
and
then
there
is
the
priviate
side
that
only
the
highest
degree
mason
every
learns
of
rex
there
are
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
nd
degree
masons
in
this
country
and
thousands
of
rds
if
nasty
stuff
was
really
going
on
dont
you
think
youd
have
more
than
a
couple
of
disgruntled
members
exposing
it
heck
if
what
you
say
is
true
then
rev
norman
vincent
peale
is
an
osiris
worshiper
long
quote
from
someone
named
hislop
source
not
given
deleted
im
attempting
to
extract
from
it
the
relevent
points
osiris
is
actually
nimrod
a
babylonian
deity
it
is
admitted
that
the
secret
system
of
free
masonry
was
originally
founded
on
the
mysteries
of
the
egyptian
isis
the
goddessmother
or
wife
of
osiris
the
babylonian
nimrod
and
osiris
are
both
connected
with
the
building
trade
ie
with
masonry
nimrod
as
the
son
of
cush
was
a
negro
isnt
this
refering
to
a
biblical
nimrod
rather
than
the
babylonian
god
there
was
a
tradition
in
egypt
recorded
by
plutarch
that
osiris
was
black
there
is
a
long
tradition
in
masonry
of
claiming
ancient
lineage
for
the
order
on
the
flimsiest
of
grounds
this
dates
right
back
to
the
constitutions
of
which
cite
adam
as
the
first
mason
ive
seen
other
claims
which
place
masonry
among
the
romans
greeks
and
egyptians
and
atlanteans
i
even
have
a
book
which
claims
to
prove
that
stonehenge
was
originally
a
masonic
temple
claims
prove
nothing
wheres
the
beef
rex
claims
exmason
showed
him
leopard
skin
he
wore
in
lodge
any
representation
of
osiris
usually
show
the
wearing
of
some
leopard
id
have
to
check
this
the
tomb
paintings
i
remember
dont
show
this
it
is
interesting
that
the
druids
of
britian
also
show
or
should
i
say
hide
this
representation
they
however
worshipped
the
spotted
cow
can
you
give
ancient
citations
for
this
the
druids
were
suppressed
over
years
ago
whats
your
point
this
whole
leopard
skin
business
sounds
bizarre
i
have
not
yet
gone
through
the
scottish
rite
which
contains
all
of
those
higher
degrees
antimasons
get
so
excited
about
and
which
was
invented
in
the
s
but
i
know
enough
people
who
have
and
who
are
good
christians
that
i
reject
your
claim
ill
stand
by
my
statements
masonry
is
of
the
mystery
religions
that
all
find
their
source
in
babylon
the
great
harlot
sorry
peter
i
do
not
mean
to
be
a
cold
slap
to
the
face
but
there
is
to
much
not
so
much
a
slap
in
the
face
as
a
weary
feeling
of
deja
vu
im
going
through
a
very
similar
argument
over
on
soccultureafricanamerican
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
masonry
doesnt
find
its
origins
in
egypt
of
the
masons
i
have
personally
talked
to
all
refered
to
egypt
as
their
origin
why
dont
you
try
reading
some
serious
books
on
masonic
history
such
as
hamills
the
craft
why
are
you
now
separating
yourself
from
this
which
not
many
years
ago
was
freely
admitted
because
we
got
honest
if
you
can
come
up
with
actual
evidence
that
masonry
existed
prior
to
id
be
very
impressed
actually
anything
earlier
than
would
be
pretty
good
