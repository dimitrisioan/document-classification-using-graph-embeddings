one
interpretation
ive
heard
of
this
verse
is
that
it
refers
to
the
sin
of
physically
abusing
ones
wife
the
husband
is
usually
physically
stronger
than
his
wife
but
is
not
permitted
to
use
this
to
dominate
her
he
must
honor
her
as
his
sister
in
christ
this
would
therefore
be
an
example
of
a
specific
sin
that
blocks
prayer

i
would
be
a
bit
more
specific
in
looking
at
this
verse
in
regard
to
blocking
prayer
i
have
trouble
thinking
that
god
would
allow
anything
to
block
our
access
to
him
in
prayer
especially
if
we
have
sinned
and
are
praying
for
forgivenenss
i
can
see
however
how
our
prayer
life
might
be
hindered
by
our
sin
if
we
are
concentrating
on
what
is
causing
the
sin
or
what
has
happened
we
may
not
be
thinking
about
prayer
thus
our
prayers
are
hindered
by
our
own
actions
but
i
dont
think
anything
can
block
the
transmission
or
reception
of
prayer
to
god
