searching
out
our
deceased
ancestors
so
that
we
can
perform
the
ordinances
such
as
baptism
confirmation
and
marriage
for
time
and
eternity
that
are
required
for
a
person
to
obtain
salvation
through
christ
and
to
live
with
him
through
the
eternities
these
are
people
who
may
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
know
christ
in
their
lifetime
so
we
are
making
it
possible
for
christs
saving
grace
i
know
there
are
thousands
of
interpretations
of
that
phrase
to
become
fully
effective
for
them
if
they
allow
it
to
do
so
on
the
other
side
this
paragraph
brought
to
mind
a
question
how
do
you
mormons
reconcile
the
idea
of
eternal
marriage
with
christs
statement
that
in
the
ressurection
people
will
neither
marry
nor
be
given
in
marriage
