has
been
some
talk
recently
of
latin
rites
from
the
early
church
used
to
bless
samesex
unionsif
anyone
has
any
idea
where
copies
of
these
rites
exist
in
whole
or
in
part
please
notify
me
by
email
i
understand
that
similar
ceremonies
written
in
slavonic
exist
as
well
let
me
know
where
i
can
find
these
it
doesnt
matter
whether
the
latin
rite
is
in
the
original
or
a
translation
however
i
would
prefer
to
have
an
english
version
of
the
slavon
ic
rite
if
it
exists
thanks
in
advance

weve
had
questions
about
this
in
the
past
the
only
source
i
know
of
is
claims
by
john
boswell
in
some
talks
he
is
said
to
be
working
on
publication
but
as
far
as
i
know
nothing
is
published
yet
i
havent
heard
of
any
other
source
if
anyone
knows
of
another
source
please
tell
us
but
i
think
were
going
to
have
to
wait
for
boswells
publication
to
appear
in
order
to
see
what
hes
really
talking
about
