do
you
mean
that
your
fellow
christians
tend
to
find
you
wacky
maybe
theyre
right
you
might
be
interested
in
franky
schaeffers
books
about
what
philistines
american
christians
are
addicted
to
mediocrity
and
more
recently
sham
pearls
for
real
swine
one
day
a
few
years
ago
franky
schaeffer
walked
into
a
greek
orthodox
church
he
is
now
an
orthodox
christian
so
is
his
mother
and
if
his
father
fransis
schaeffer
had
not
passed
away
he
too
would
have
come
into
the
church
franky
like
many
americans
who
have
recently
found
the
orthodox
church
described
the
experience
as
finally
coming
home
after
a
long
jouney
through
a
desert
you
should
also
read
the
book
becoming
orthodox
by
peter
gillquist
it
describes
the
long
journey
of
some
weary
evangelical
protestants
to
the
orthodox
church
come
taste
and
see
how
good
the
lord
is

richardson
