i
posted
this
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
appeared
on
the
newsgroup
and
i
havent
had
a
reply
from
the
moderator
we
were
having
intermittent
problems
with
our
mail
at
the
time
please
excuse
me
if
you
have
seen
this
before
should
christians
fight
last
week
alastair
posted
some
questions
about
fighting
and
whether
there
are
such
things
as
justifiable
wars
i
have
started
looking
into
these
things
and
have
jotted
down
my
findings
as
i
go
i
havent
answered
all
his
questions
yet
and
i
know
what
i
have
here
is
on
a
slightly
different
tack
but
possibly
ill
be
able
to
get
into
it
more
deeply
later
and
post
some
more
info
soon
may
i
suggest
the
book
ethics
by
dr
norm
geisler
of
dallas
theological
seminary
in
it
he
goes
over
all
the
arguments
pro
and
con
and
inbetween
and
comes
up
with
a
very
reasonable
answer
if
i
have
time
and
there
is
enough
interest
i
may
post
his
position
