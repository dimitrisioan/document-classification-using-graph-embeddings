subject
re
the
bible
on
the
immaculate
conception
in
article
writes
i
will
put
enmity
between
you
the
serpent
and
the
woman
and
between
your
seed
and
her
seed
she
can
also
be
read
he
shall
crush
your
head
and
you
shall
bruise
her
or
his
heel
genesis
in
the
hebrew
of
genesis
the
gender
is
clearly
masculine
he
shall
crush
your
head
and
you
shall
bruise
his
heel
the
latin
has
feminine
forms
only
by
an
accident
of
grammar
i
have
yet
to
see
an
adequate
explanation
of
st
jeromes
translation
of
genesis
his
latin
clearly
uses
the
feminine
but
i
dont
know
why
since
the
hebrew
is
clearly
masculine
if
anyone
knows
of
a
scholarly
treatment
of
this
puzzle
i
would
appreciate
hearing
from
you
