this
is
what
indicates
to
me
that
you
may
believe
in
predestination
am
i
correct
i
do
not
believe
in
predestination
i
believe
we
all
choose
whether
or
not
we
will
accept
gods
gift
of
salvation
to
us
again
fundamental
difference
which
cant
really
be
resolved
of
course
i
believe
in
predestination
its
a
very
biblical
doctrine
as
romans
shows
among
other
passages
furthermore
the
church
has
always
taught
predestination
from
the
very
beginning
but
to
say
that
i
believe
in
predestination
does
not
mean
i
do
not
believe
in
free
will
men
freely
choose
the
course
of
their
life
which
is
also
affected
by
the
grace
of
god
however
unlike
the
calvinists
and
jansenists
i
hold
that
grace
is
resistable
otherwise
you
end
up
with
the
idiocy
of
denying
the
universal
saving
will
of
god
timothy
for
god
must
give
enough
grace
to
all
to
be
saved
but
only
the
elect
who
he
foreknew
are
predestined
and
receive
the
grace
of
final
perserverance
which
guarantees
heaven
this
does
not
mean
that
those
without
that
grace
cant
be
saved
it
just
means
that
god
foreknew
their
obstinacy
and
chose
not
to
give
it
to
them
knowing
they
would
not
need
it
as
they
had
freely
chosen
hell
people
who
are
saved
are
saved
by
the
grace
of
god
and
not
by
their
own
effort
for
it
was
god
who
disposed
them
to
himself
and
predestined
them
to
become
saints
but
those
who
perish
in
everlasting
fire
perish
because
they
hardened
their
heart
and
chose
to
perish
thus
they
were
deserving
of
gods
punishment
as
they
had
rejected
their
creator
and
sinned
against
the
working
of
the
holy
spirit
yes
it
is
up
to
god
to
judge
but
he
will
only
mete
out
that
punishment
at
the
last
judgement
well
i
would
hold
that
as
god
most
certainly
gives
everybody
some
blessing
for
what
good
they
have
done
even
if
it
was
only
a
little
for
those
he
cant
bless
in
the
next
life
he
blesses
in
this
one
and
those
he
will
not
punish
in
the
next
life
will
be
chastised
in
this
one
or
in
purgatory
for
their
sins
every
sin
incurs
some
temporal
punishment
thus
god
will
punish
it
unless
satisfaction
is
made
for
it
cf
samuel
davids
sin
of
adultery
and
murder
were
forgiven
but
he
was
still
punished
with
the
death
of
his
child
and
i
need
not
point
out
the
idea
of
punishment
because
of
gods
judgement
is
quite
prevelant
in
the
bible
sodom
and
gommorrah
moses
barred
from
the
holy
land
the
slaughter
of
the
cannanites
annias
and
saphira
jerusalem
in
ad
etc
if
jesus
stopped
the
stoning
of
an
adulterous
woman
perhaps
this
is
not
a
good
parallel
but
im
going
to
go
with
it
anyway
why
should
we
not
stop
the
murder
and
violation
of
people
who
may
or
may
not
be
more
innocent
we
should
stop
the
slaughter
of
the
innocent
cf
proverbs
but
does
that
mean
that
christians
should
support
a
war
in
bosnia
with
the
us
or
even
the
un
involved
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
am
an
isolationist
and
disagree
with
foreign
adventures
in
general
but
in
the
case
of
bosnia
i
frankly
see
no
excuse
for
us
getting
militarily
involved
it
would
not
be
a
just
war
blessed
after
all
are
the
peacemakers
was
what
our
lord
said
not
the
interventionists
our
actions
in
bosnia
must
be
for
peace
and
not
for
a
war
which
is
unrelated
to
anything
to
justify
it
for
us
