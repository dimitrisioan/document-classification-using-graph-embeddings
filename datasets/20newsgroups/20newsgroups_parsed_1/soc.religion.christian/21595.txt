but
i
am
interested
in
your
claim
that
early
christian
practices
parallel
mormon
temple
ceremonies
could
you
give
an
example
also
why
do
they
only
parallel
mormon
ceremonies
why
dont
mormon
ceremonies
restore
the
original
christian
practices
wasnt
that
the
whole
point
of
joseph
smiths
stated
mission
if
you
want
parallels
the
best
source
is
probably
the
book
temple
and
cosmos
by
hugh
nibley
it
is
not
light
reading
however
as
to
why
these
early
practices
only
parallel
and
do
not
exactly
duplicate
the
modern
lds
ceremony
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
quite
likely
we
do
not
have
the
exact
original
from
ancient
times
this
stuff
was
not
commonly
known
but
bits
and
pieces
undoubtedly
spread
much
as
bits
and
pieces
of
the
modern
ceremony
get
known
what
we
have
in
the
day
literature
the
egyptian
ceremonies
and
certain
native
american
ceremonies
is
almost
certainly
not
exactly
what
jesus
taught
certain
aspects
of
the
ceremony
are
normally
modified
to
fit
the
situation
much
as
the
modern
ceremony
has
been
modified
to
fit
the
audiovisual
tools
now
available
