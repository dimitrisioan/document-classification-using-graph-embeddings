like
to

the
the
background
of
the

i
want
to

about

i
have
never
heard
of
this
one
jn
darby
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
plymouth

and
an
early
supporter
of
dispensationalism
ff
bruce
highly
approved
of
his
translation
he
also
translated
the
bible
into
several
other
languages
youngs
literal
translation
i
have
also
never
heard
of
this
was
from
the
same
fellow
who
did
youngs
concordance
which
was
a
standard
reference
work
similar
to
strongs
concordance
the
realiability
of
the
hebrewgreek
lexicon
i
believe
that
these
just
follow
standard
reference
works
the
authors
from
which
denomination
etc
of
the
articles
in
the
topics
modules
some
are
by
larry
pierce
brethren
some
are
by
baptists
and
i
think
that
thompson
of
chain
reference
fame
was
presbyterian
the
realiability
of
the
treasury
of
scripture
knowlege
as
i
have
never
heard
of
too
another
standard
reference
work
that
has
been
around
for
decades
a
new
version
was
just
released
and
is
available
through
christian
book
distributers
who
are
the
commentators
scofield
and
bw
johnson
who
wrote
the
scofield
reference
bible
and
the
peoples
new
testament
respectively
ci
scofield
was
the
creator
of
the
scofield
reference
bible
for
many
people
but
not
me
this
is
the
study
bible
the
notes
are
strongly
dispensational
the
realiability
of
the
strong
numbers
these
are
probably
the
most
accurate
strongs
numbers
available
