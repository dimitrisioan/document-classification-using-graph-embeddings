the
deuterocanonical
books
were
added
much
later
in
the
churchs
history
they
do
not
have
the
same
spiritual
quality
as
the
rest
of
scripture
i
do
not
believe
the
church
that
added
these
books
was
guided
by
the
spirit
in
so
doing
and
that
is
where
this
sort
of
discussion
ultimately
ends
the
apocryphal
books
that
are
in
the
septuagint
were
part
of
the
canon
used
by
the
greekspeaking
churches
from
the
inception
of
the
church
they
were
not
added
later
or
much
later
this
is
a
common
misconception
the
preference
of
the
hebrew
canon
over
the
greek
canon
is
a
later
innovation
the
church
did
not
need
to
be
guided
to
add
the
books
since
they
were
part
of
the
faith
once
received
by
the
apostles
and
passed
to
the
church
