in
a
message
to
all
which
brings
me
around
to
asking
an
open
question
is
the
bible
a
closed
book
of
scripture
is
it
okay
for
us
to
go
around
saying
god
told
me
this
and
jesus
told
me
that
also
interesting
to
note
is
that
some
so
called
prophecies
are
nothing
new
but
rather
an
inspired
translation
of
scripture
is
it
right
to
call
that
prophecy
misleading
hi
you
might
want
to
read
charismatic
chaos
by
john
macarthur
in
it
he
discussed
exactly
this
queation
amongst
others
in
my
own
words
very
simplified
his
position
is
basically
that
one
must
decide
what
is
the
most
important
experience
or
scripture
people
tend
to
say
scripture
without
living
according
to
that
their
own
feelingprophecyetc
tends
to
be
put
across
without
testing
in
the
light
of
scripture
theres
a
lot
more
than
this
really
worthwhile
to
read
whether
youre
charismatic
or
not
