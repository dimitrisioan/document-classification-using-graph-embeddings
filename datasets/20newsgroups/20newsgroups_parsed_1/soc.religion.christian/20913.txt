am
currently
researching
into

am
looking
at
the
way

the
moment

am
formlulating
information
on
discipline
within
the
christian

this
catagory

to
the
following
questionaire
all

will
be
treated
confidentially
and

only
be
used
to
prepare
stats
ages
sexes
of
children
do
you
spank
your
kids
if
so
how
often
do
you
use
an
implement

if
you

not
spank
what
method
of
discipline

of
did

i
hope
it
is
obvious
that

to
this
question
are
likely

have
serious
problems
when
used

research
purposes
our
readers
are
not
likely
to
be
a
random
sample
of
christians
and
this
form
does
not
contain
enough
information
to
act
as
a
stratified
sample
perhaps
someone
who
is
familiar
with
research
methods
might
want
to
correspond
with
him
