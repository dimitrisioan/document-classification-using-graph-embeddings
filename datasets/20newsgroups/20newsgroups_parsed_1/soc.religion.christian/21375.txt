hello
all
i
have
a
question
about
satan
i
was
taught
a
long
time
ago
that
satan
was
really
an
angel
of
god
and
was
kicked
out
of
heaven
because
he
challenged
gods
authority
the
problem
is
i
can
not
find
this
in
the
bible
is
it
in
the
bible
if
not
where
did
it
originate
i
did
a
workshop
on
this
for
an
episcopalian
student
gathering
a
couple
months
ago
because
i
wanted
to
know
the
answer
too
as
far
as
i
could
tell
although
that
story
was
never
specifically
told
in
the
bible
many
references
are
made
to
it
primarily
in
the
new
testament
in
the
old
testament
there
is
actually
an
entirely
different
view
of
satan
as
a
excuse
the
pun
devils
advocate
for
yahweh
see
the
book
of
job
getting
back
to
the
fallen
angel
story
there
are
no
references
to
lucifer
in
the
bible
except
for
a
mistranslation
of
the
morning
star
in
the
king
james
version
isaiah
which
probably
referred
to
a
babylonian
monarch
much
in
the
same
was
as
the
sun
king
referred
to
louis
xiv
all
in
all
i
dont
know
where
the
story
came
from
it
may
have
been
rolling
around
for
a
long
time
or
milton
paradise
lost
may
have
invented
it
sorry
for
the
sketchiness
of
the
rest
of
this
but
i
am
in
a
hurry
and
need
to
eat
lunch
feel
free
to
email
me
about
the
other
stuff
i
found
out
although
a
lot
of
it
is
just
the
result
of
a
bible
concordance
program
called
quickverse
its
really
lousy
by
the
way
dont
buy
it
wondering
