john
paraphrased
at
the
end
of
a
recent
mon
apr
post
alastair
thomson
offers
the
following
paraphrase
of
john
god
loved
the
world
so
much
that
he
gave
us
his
son
to
die
in
our
place
so
that
we
may
have
eternal
life
the
to
die
in
our
place
bothers
me
since
it
inserts
into
the
verse
a
doctrine
not
found
in
the
original
moreover
i
suspect
that
the
poster
intends
to
affirm
not
merely
substitution
but
forensic
or
penal
substitution
i
maintain
that
the
scriptures
in
speaking
of
the
atonement
teach
a
doctrine
of
substitution
but
not
one
of
forensic
substitution
those
interested
in
pursuing
the
matter
are
invited
to
send
for
my
essays
on
genesis
either
thru
on
this
question
or
through
with
leadin
the
nth
essay
can
be
obtained
by
sending
to
or
to
the
message

any
theologian
worth
his
salt
can
put
anything
he
wants
to
say
in
the
form
of
a
commentary
on
the
book
of
genesis
