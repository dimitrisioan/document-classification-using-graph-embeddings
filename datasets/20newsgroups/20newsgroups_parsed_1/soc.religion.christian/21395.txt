re
homosexuality
issues
in
christianity
can
someone
cite
biblical
references
to
homosexuality
being
immoral
other
than
leviticus
so
far
when
i
ask
around
here
i
get
the
verses
from
leviticus
spouted
at
me
but
the
whole
rest
of
that
book
tends
to
be
ignored
by
christians
havent
seen
any
stonings
in
a
long
time
later
max
bob
muir
the
list
was
posted
not
long
ago
as
i
recall
aside
from
lev
commonly
cited
passages
are
the
story
of
sodom
note
however
that
this
was
a
homosexual
rape
and
theres
no
disagreement
that
that
is
wrong
i
take
an
intermediate
position
on
this
note
that
sodom
is
referred
to
elsewhere
in
the
bible
for
its
sinfulness
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
known
specifically
for
homosexuality
rather
i
think
it
was
considered
a
cesspool
of
all
sins
however
from
what
we
know
of
jewish
attitudes
homosexuality
would
have
contributed
to
the
horror
of
the
action
described
it
almost
seems
to
have
been
contrived
to
combine
about
as
many
forms
of
evil
in
one
act
as
possible
homosexual
rape
of
guests
who
were
actually
angels
but
this
story
is
not
specifically
about
homosexuality
in
the
nt
the
clear
references
are
all
from
pauls
letters
in
rom
there
is
a
passage
that
presupposes
that
homosexuality
is
an
evil
note
that
the
passage
isnt
about
homosexuality
its
about
idolatry
homosexuality
is
visited
on
people
as
a
punishment
or
at
least
result
of
idolatry
there
are
a
number
of
arguments
over
this
passage
it
does
not
use
the
word
homosexuality
and
it
is
referring
to
people
who
are
by
nature
heterosexual
practicing
homosexuality
so
its
not
what
id
call
an
explicit
teaching
against
all
homosexuality
but
it
does
seem
to
support
what
would
be
a
natural
assumption
anyway
that
paul
shares
the
general
negative
jewish
attitude
towards
homosexuality
the
other
passages
occur
in
lists
of
sins
in
i
cor
and
i
tim
unfortunately
its
not
entirely
clear
what
the
words
used
here
mean
there
have
been
suggestions
that
one
has
a
broader
meaning
such
as
wanton
and
that
another
may
be
specifically
male
prostitute
again
we
dont
have
here
a
precise
teaching
about
homosexuality
but
it
is
at
least
weak
supportive
evidence
that
paul
shared
the
ots
negative
judgement
on
homosexuality
jude
is
sometimes
cited
however
its
probably
not
relevant
the
context
in
jude
involves
angels
since
those
who
were
almost
raped
in
sodom
were
angels
it
seems
likely
that
strange
flesh
refers
to
intercourse
with
angels
as
you
can
see
the
nt
evidence
is
such
that
peoples
conclusion
is
determined
by
their
approach
to
the
bible
conservatives
note
that
the
passages
from
pauls
letters
imply
that
he
accepted
the
ot
prohibition
this
is
enough
for
them
to
regard
it
as
having
nt
endorsement
liberals
note
that
theres
no
specific
teaching
and
no
clear
definition
of
what
is
being
prohibited
or
why
is
the
concern
in
rom
the
connection
of
homosexuality
to
pagan
worship
what
exactly
do
the
words
in
the
lists
of
sins
mean
thus
some
believe
it
is
legitimate
to
regard
this
as
a
attitude
paul
took
with
him
from
his
background
and
not
a
specific
teaching
of
the
gospel
this
is
an
explosive
topic
which
tends
to
result
in
long
dissertations
on
the
exact
meaning
of
various
greek
words
but
its
clear
to
me
that
thats
mostly
irrelevant
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is
whether
people
are
looking
to
the
bible
for
law
or
whether
they
believe
that
such
as
approach
is
inconsistent
with
the
gospel
this
appears
to
depend
upon
ones
reaction
to
the
message
of
the
bible
as
a
whole
as
well
as
ones
perception
of
the
needs
of
the
church
today
this
is
a
difference
of
approach
at
least
as
serious
as
the
difference
between
protestant
and
catholic
in
the
th
cent
and
one
where
both
sides
believe
that
the
bible
is
so
obviously
on
their
side
that
they
keep
thinking
all
they
have
to
do
is
quote
a
few
more
passages
and
the
other
side
will
finally
come
to
their
senses
that
makes
things
very
frustrating
for
a
moderator
who
realizes
that
such
an
optimistic
outcome
is
not
very
likely
