subject
being
right
about
messiahs
i
must
have
missed
the
postings
about
waco
david
koresh
and
the
second
coming
how
does
one
tell
if
a
second
coming
is
the
real
thing
unless
the
person
claiming
to
be
it
is
obviously
insane
im
not
saying
that
david
koresh
is
the
second
coming
of
christ
how
could
somebody
who
breaks
his
word
be
the
second
coming
koresh
did
promise
that
he
would
come
out
of
his
compound
if
only
he
was
allowed
to
give
a
radio
broadcast
he
didnt
still
it
seems
to
me
that
he
did
fool
some
people
and
from
my
meagre
knowledge
of
the
bible
it
seems
that
christians
have
been
hard
on
the
jews
of
christs
day
for
being
cautious
about
accepting
somebody
that
their
religious
authorities
didnt
accept
as
the
messiah
so
i
was
surprised
that
nobody
had
discussed
the
difficulty
of
wanting
to
be
early
to
recognize
the
second
coming
while
at
the
same
time
not
wanting
to
be
credulously
believing
just
anybody
who
claims
to
be
god
mark
and
then
if
any
one
says
to
you
look
here
is
the
christ
or
look
there
he
is
do
not
believe
it
mark
false
christs
and
false
prophets
will
arise
and
show
signs
and
wonders
to
lead
astray
if
possible
the
elect
mark
but
take
heed
i
have
told
you
all
things
beforehand
mark
but
in
those
days
after
that
tribulation
the
sun
will
be
darkened
and
the
moon
will
not
give
its
light
mark
and
the
stars
will
be
falling
from
heaven
and
the
powers
in
the
heavens
will
be
shaken
mark
and
then
they
will
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
clouds
with
great
power
and
glory
my
understanding
of
jesus
answer
is
that
unlike
his
first
coming
which
was
veiled
the
second
coming
will
be
quite
unmistakeable
hes
telling
us
not
to
be
misled
by
the
other
things
that
have
to
happen
before
his
second
coming
the
actual
second
coming
will
make
his
power
openly
visible
by
the
way
from
koreshs
public
statement
its
not
so
clear
to
me
that
he
is
claiming
to
be
christ
