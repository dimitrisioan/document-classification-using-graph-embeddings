i
have
enrolled
in
the
history
of
christianity
at
a
college
here
in
st
louis
the
teacher
of
the
class
is
what
i
consider
to
be
closedminded
and
bigotted
on
the
subject
of
what
the
definition
of
christianity
is
his
definition
is
tied
directly
to
that
of
the
trinity
and
the
catholic
churchs
definition
of
it
and
belief
in
jesus
christ
is
not
sufficient
to
call
ones
self
a
christian
what
you
call
the
trinity
and
the
catholic
churchs
definition
of
it
is
precisely
the
result
of
the
first
christians
getting
together
and
trying
to
find
an
acceptable
answer
to
your
question
what
is
a
christian
i
cant
see
what
you
are
objecting
to
someone
is
saying
what
historians
of
all
beliefs
would
agree
on
and
you
are
calling
him
a
closedminded
bigot
you
really
ought
to
say
what
you
mean
by
belief
in
jesus
christ
it
is
not
a
wording
that
is
sufficient
to
describe
a
christian
muslims
believe
in
jesus
christ
although
they
believe
he
was
a
prophet
and
not
the
incarnated
son
of
god
but
followers
of
eastern
religions
might
be
quite
happy
to
say
that
jesus
was
the
incarnation
of
god
along
with
large
numbers
of
other
historical
and
mythical
figures
so
perhaps
you
ought
to
rephrase
your
question
and
say
precisely
what
it
is
in
the
traditional
definitions
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
christian
as
handed
down
by
the
universal
church
you
object
to
but
regard
as
unnecessary
for
being
a
christian
