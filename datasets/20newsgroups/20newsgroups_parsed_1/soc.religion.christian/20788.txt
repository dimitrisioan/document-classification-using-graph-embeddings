subject
re
the
arrogance
of
christians
ive
just
read
carols
response
and
i
just
had
to
get
into
this
ive
got
some
verses
which
are
not
subject
to
interpretation
because
they
say
what
they
say
joe
just
cause
you
say
they
arent
subject
to
interpretation
doesnt
necesarily
make
it
so
thats
your
interpretation
of
these
texts
they
are
peter
timothy
and
galatians
peter
but
know
this
first
of
all
that
no
prophecy
of
scripture
is
a
matter
of
ones
own
interpretation
for
no
prophecy
was
ever
made
by
an
act
of
human
will
but
men
moved
by
the
holy
spirit
spoke
from
god
the
study
notes
in
my
bible
offer
three
possible
meanings
for
verse
apparantly
its
not
as
clear
to
charles
ryrie
as
it
is
to
you
timothy
all
scripture
is
inspired
by
god
and
profitable
for
teaching
for
reproof
for
correction
for
training
in
righteousness
that
the
man
of
god
may
be
adequate
equipped
for
every
good
work
galations
for
i
would
have
you
know
brethren
that
the
gospel
which
was
preached
by
me
is
not
according
to
man
for
i
neither
received
it
from
man
nor
was
i
taught
it
but
i
receieved
it
through
a
revelation
of
jesus
christ
when
i
read
these
passages
it
was
not
immediately
clear
to
me
what
every
phrase
meant
i
had
stop
and
think
about
the
possible
connotations
of
words
what
the
intent
of
the
author
may
have
been
wonder
if
the
translator
used
the
correct
english
word
to
convey
the
same
meaning
i
had
to
interpret
if
you
want
to
believe
that
your
are
not
interpreting
scripture
as
you
read
theres
probably
nothing
i
can
say
to
change
your
mind
but
i
think
its
naive
to
think
that
our
culture
experiences
education
do
not
affect
everything
we
read
also
based
on
the
fact
that
jesus
is
the
word
incarnate
and
he
judges
people
if
they
follow
him
see
acts
and
john
and
that
those
who
reject
jesus
teachings
are
judged
by
the
very
words
he
spoke
see
john
then
jesus
words
are
true
and
do
not
need
interpretation
nor
would
it
be
just
of
god
to
judge
based
on
his
word
if
it
had
to
be
interpreted
in
college
i
took
an
entire
course
in
biblical
interpretation
go
to
any
christian
bookstore
there
are
scores
of
books
on
interpreting
and
understanding
scripture
if
interpretation
is
unnecessary
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
misguided
christians
out
there
wasting
a
lot
of
time
and
energy
