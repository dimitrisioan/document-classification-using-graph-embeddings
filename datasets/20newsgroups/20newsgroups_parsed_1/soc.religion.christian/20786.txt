i
think
its
really
sad
that
so
many
people
put
their
faith
in
a
mere
man
even
if
he
did
claim
to
be
the
son
of
god
andor
a
prophet
ill
pose
a
question
here
thats
got
me
thinking
what
distinguishes
true
religion
from
cults
im
speaking
generally
here
not
specifially
about
christianity
jerry
falwell
was
on
good
morning
america
on
tuesday
ostensibly
to
answer
this
question
basically
he
said
that
true
religion
follows
a
message
whereas
a
cult
follows
a
person
but
then
christianity
is
a
cult
because
the
message
of
christianity
is
the
person
of
jesus
so
what
distinguishes
for
example
the
branch
davidian
cult
from
the
presbyterian
church
doctrinal
differences
dont
answer
the
question
imho
so
dont
use
them
as
an
answer
scott
at
brandeis
but
god
demonstrates
his
the
lord
bless
you
and
keep
you
own
love
for
us
in
that
the
lord
make
his
face
shine
on
you
while
we
were
yet
sinners
and
be
gracious
to
you
christ
died
for
us
the
lord
lift
up
his
countenance
on
you
and
give
you
peace

there
have
been
some
attempts
to
characterize
cult
most
commonly
it
uses
characteristics
involving
high
pressure
brainwashing
techniques
etc
but
some
people
characterize
it
by
doctrinal
error
in
the
end
im
afraid
it
becomes
a
term
with
no
precise
meaning
thats
used
primarily
to
dismiss
groups
as
not
worthy
of
serious
consideration
that
doesnt
mean
that
there
arent
groups
that
do
highly
irresponsible
things
and
have
serious
doctrinal
errors
but
past
discussions
have
not
suggested
to
me
that
cult
is
a
very
helpful
term
