thinking
about
heaven
james
sledd
asks
what
is
the
nature
of
eternal
life
how
can
we
as
mortals
locked
into
spacetime
conceive
of
it
a
if
the
best
we
can
do
is
metaphoranalogy
then
what
is
the
best
metaphor
c
s
lewiss
essay
the
weight
of
glory
deals
with
this
question
i
recommend
it
enthusiastically
you
might
also
read
the
chapter
on
heaven
in
his
book
the
problem
of
pain
he
gives
a
fictional
treatment
in
his
book
the
great
divorce
i
have
found
all
of
these
very
helpful
you
might
also
be
helped
by
the
treatment
in
dantes
divine
comedy
heaven
occupies
the
last
third
of
the
poem
but
i
can
not
imagine
reading
it
other
than
from
the
beginning
i
urge
you
to
use
the
translation
by
dorothy
