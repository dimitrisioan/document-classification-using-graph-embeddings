re
march
for
jesus
the
only
info
i
have
is
my
area
is
not
having
a
large
march
they
are
leaving
it
up
to
each
congragation
imo
this
means
organizers
found
it
too
difficult
to
manage
or
no
one
feels
the
need
to
be
involved
im
not
casting
stones
my
involvement
with
the
lord
does
not
include
the
march
this
year
maybe
he
is
giving
a
message
by
the
lack
of
one
