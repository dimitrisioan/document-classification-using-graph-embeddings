re
sabbath
admissions
of
i
have
been
following
this
thread
on
talkreligion
socreligionchristianbiblestudy
and
here
with
interest
i
am
amazed
at
the
different
nonbiblical
argument
those
who
oppose
the
sabbath
present
one
question
comes
to
mind
especially
since
my
last
one
was
not
answered
from
scripture
maybe
clh
may
wish
to
provide
the
first
response
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
sabbath
of
the
tc
being
ceremonial
answer
this
since
the
tc
commandments
is
one
law
with
ten
parts
on
what
biblical
basis
have
you
decided
that
only
the
sabbath
portion
is
ceremonial
or
you
say
that
the
seventhday
is
the
sabbath
but
not
applicable
to
gentile
christians
does
that
mean
the
sabbath
commandment
has
been
annulled
references
please
if
god
did
not
intend
his
requirements
on
the
jews
to
be
applicable
to
gentile
christians
why
did
he
make
it
plain
that
the
gentiles
were
now
grafted
into
the
commonwealth
of
israel
darius
acts
rom
col
gal
i
believe
weve
gotten
into
a
loop
at
this
point
this
is
one
of
those
classic
situations
where
both
sides
think
they
have
clear
scriptural
support
and
theres
no
obvious
argument
that
is
going
to
change
anybodys
mind
i
dont
think
were
going
anything
but
repeating
ourselves
