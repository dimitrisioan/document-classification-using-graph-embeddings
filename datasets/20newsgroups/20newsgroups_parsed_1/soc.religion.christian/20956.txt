davidians
most
of
you
will
have
probably
seen
the
news
by
the
time
you
read
this
but
the
branch
davidian
compound
is
no
more
this
morning
about
the
feds
punched
holes
in
the
compound
walls
by
using
a
tank
they
then
started
using
nonlethal
tear
gas
shortly
after
noon
cult
members
were
seen
setting
fire
to
the
compound
so
far
about
people
have
been
seen
outside
the
compound
the
fate
of
the
other
or
people
is
unknown
neither
is
the
fate
of
the
children
that
were
inside
the
compound
did
burn
to
the
ground
koresh
who
at
times
has
claimed
to
be
the
messiah
but
then
backed
off
and
only
claimed
to
be
a
prophet
had
promised
several
times
to
come
out
peacefully
if
his
demands
were
met
first
he
demanded
that
his
message
be
broadcast
on
the
radio
which
it
was
but
he
didnt
come
out
he
claimed
to
be
waiting
for
a
message
from
god
finally
he
said
that
god
told
him
that
he
needed
to
decipher
the
mystery
of
the
seals
in
revelation
and
when
he
was
finished
hed
come
out
he
finished
the
first
one
but
didnt
do
any
more
work
that
anyone
knows
of
since
then
the
federal
agents
did
warn
him
that
if
they
didnt
come
out
they
would
be
subjected
to
tear
gas
i
think
its
really
sad
that
so
many
people
put
their
faith
in
a
mere
man
even
if
he
did
claim
to
be
the
son
of
god
andor
a
prophet
i
think
it
underscores
the
importance
of
putting
you
faith
only
in
things
that
are
eternal
and
knowing
for
yourself
what
the
scriptures
say
and
what
they
mean
instead
of
relying
on
others
to
do
it
for
you
even
if
those
others
are
learned
and
mean
well
