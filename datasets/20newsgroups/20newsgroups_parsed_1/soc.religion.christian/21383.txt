c
s
lewis
made
the
same
point
in
an
essay
after

when
some
christian

were
urging

i
was
surprised
when
i
heard
this
same
kind
of
remark
from
a
fellow
grad
student
i
know
especially
since
he
had
seminary
training
i
have
read
the
same
essay
and
do
not
find
lewis
making
any
such
claim
rather
lewis
is
condemning
the
use
of
such
coporate
prayer
efforts
as
platforms
to
make
political
jabs
at
opponents
feigned
as
confessions
of
guilt
ie
lord
please
forgive
us
for
allowing
insert
political
issueideaplatform
to
exist
in
our
country
it
is
wrong
and
we
ask
your
forgiveness
i
would
be
interested
in
knowing
what
part
of
the
essay
you
feel
condemns
national
repentance
