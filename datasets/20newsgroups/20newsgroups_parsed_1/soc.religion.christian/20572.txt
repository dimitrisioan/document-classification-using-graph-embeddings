im
inclined
to
read
descriptions
such
as
the
lake
of
fire
as
indicating
annihilation
however
thats
a
minority
view
its
my
personal
view
but
the
only
denominations
i
know
of
that
hold
it
officially
are
the
jws
and
sdas
i
cant
find
the
reference
right
now
but
didnt
cslewis
speculate
somewhere
that
hell
might
be
the
state
of
once
having
been
a
human
soul
