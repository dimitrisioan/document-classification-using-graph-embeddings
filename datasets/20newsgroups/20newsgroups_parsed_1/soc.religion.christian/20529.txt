writes
there
had
been
recent
criticism
of
this
in
a
listserv
for
academic
biblical
scholars
they
all
say
the
books
are
modern
fakes
dh
which
listsev
was
this
and
is
the
discussion
still
current
my
questioning
is
based
on
some
information
presented
from
the
essene
nt
that
challenges
some
of
my
eating
choices
as
the
info
came
from
a
biased
opposed
to
my
preferences
third
party
i
am
looking
for
info
as
to
whether
i
should
dismiss
this
work
or
put
some
consideration
into
it
thanks
again
