anyhow
many
interpret
this
to
mean
that
the
child
has
gone
to
heaven
where
david
will
someday
go
i
dont
claim
to
know
for
sure
if
this
applies
to
all
babies
or
not
but
even
if
its
just
this
one
what
would
you
say
to
this
that
brings
up
an
interesting
question
if
this
interpretation
is
correct
how
would
these
people
be
getting
into
heaven
before
jesus
opened
the
gates
of
heaven
