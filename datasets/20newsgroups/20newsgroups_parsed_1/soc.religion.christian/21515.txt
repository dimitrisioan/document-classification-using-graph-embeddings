writes
in
the
nt
the
clear
references
are
all
from
pauls
letters
in
rom
there
is
a
passage
that
presupposes
that
homosexuality
is
an
evil
note
that
the
passage
isnt
about
homosexuality
its
about
idolatry
homosexuality
is
visited
on
people
as
a
punishment
or
at
least
result
of
idolatry
there
are
a
number
of
arguments
over
this
passage
it
does
not
use
the
word
homosexuality
and
it
is
referring
to
people
who
are
by
nature
heterosexual
practicing
homosexuality
so
its
not
what
id
call
an
explicit
teaching
against
all
homosexuality
thats
like
saying
that
murder
is
only
wrong
for
those
of
us
who
arent
natural
murders
and
stealing
is
only
wrong
for
those
of
us
who
arent
natural
thieves
