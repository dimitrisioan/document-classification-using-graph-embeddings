subject
socreligionchristian
after
reading
the
posts
on
this
newsgroup
for
the
pasts
months
it
has
become
apparent
to
me
that
this
group
is
primarily
active
with
liberals
catholics
new
agers
and
athiests
someone
might
think
to
change
the
name
to
socreligionany
or
perhaps
even
socreligionnew
it
might
seem
to
be
more
appropriate
heck
dont
flame
me
im
catholic
gay
and
i
voted
for
bill
clinton
im
on
your
side
