muslims
i
fear
have
been
given
a
lie
from
the
fater
of
lies
satan
they
need
christ
as
do
us
all
stan
toney
my
opinions
are
my
own
you
may
borrow
them
just
picked
out
this
one
point
because
it
struck
me
why
do
you
believe
this
muslims
believe
in
many
of
the
same
things
that
christians
and
jews
believe
they
believe
jesus
while
not
the
messiah
is
a
prophet
this
seems
to
me
to
be
much
closer
to
christianity
than
other
religions
are
then
again
i
tend
to
be
somewhat
liberal
about
others
beliefs
this
also
relates
to
the
serbian
ethnic
cleansing
question
i
have
been
waiting
for
condemnations
of
this
and
have
seen
very
few
how
can
we
stand
by
and
watch
innocent
people
even
people
whose
beliefs
we
condemn
if
this
is
the
case
and
dont
get
me
wrong
the
things
fundamenalist
muslims
have
to
say
about
women
make
my
blood
boil
be
tortured
raped
the
stories
about
that
made
me
physically
ill
and
killed
jesus
loves
all
not
just
those
who
love
him
back
and
he
would
advocate
kindness
toward
them
in
the
hopes
of
converting
them
if
thats
the
way
you
want
to
put
it
rather
than
killing
them
im
sorry
i
got
off
the
subject
here
maybe
i
should
have
used
a
different
title
i
did
need
to
get
this
off
my
chest
however
peace
shalom
vera
shanti
hand
over
hand
doesnt
seem
so
much
vera
noyes
hand
over
hand
is
the
strength
of
the
common
touch
drop
me
a
line
if
youre
in
the
mood
rush
hand
over
fist
i
am
also
worried
about
this
issue
ive
made
a
posting
under
my
own
name
earlier
today
i
do
not
much
want
to
discuss
moslem
beliefs
here
this
isnt
the
right
group
for
it
their
beliefs
about
jesus
appear
to
come
as
much
from
the
koran
as
the
bible
this
means
that
while
they
honor
him
what
they
think
he
did
and
stood
for
differs
in
many
ways
from
christian
beliefs
about
him
but
moslem
beliefs
are
an
appropriate
topic
for
socreligionislam
as
im
sure
you
know
many
christians
believe
that
you
must
accept
christ
in
order
to
be
saved
while
stanleys
comment
appears
to
be
antimoslem
i
would
assume
he
would
say
the
same
thing
about
all
religions
other
than
christianity
