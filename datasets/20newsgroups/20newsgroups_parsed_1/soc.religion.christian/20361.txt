when
i
do
programs
i
spend
about
half
the
time
talking
about
absitinence
i
find
that
most
people
who
object
to
sex
education
actually
object
to
the
teaching
anything
other
than
abstinencne
and
that
imo
is
just
as
irresponsible
as
only
talking
about
comdom
use
im
under
the
impression
that
most
sex
ed
instructors
andor
policy
makers
actually
object
to
making
any
more
than
a
passing
reference
to
abstinence
wishing
to
spend
time
only
on
the
realistic
choices
in
the
sex
ed
portion
of
the

impressed
that
the
only
positive
way
to
not
get
pregnant
was
to
not
have
sex

and

failure
rate

that

not
religious
