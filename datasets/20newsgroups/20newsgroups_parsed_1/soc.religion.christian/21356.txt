re
atheists
and
hell
imagine
the
worst
depth
of
despair
youve
ever
encountered
or
the
worst
physical
pain
youve
ever
experienced
some
people
suffer
such
emotional
physical
and
mental
anguish
in
their
lives
that
their
deaths
seem
to
be
merciful
but
at
least
the
pain
does
end
in
death
what
if
you
lived
a
hundred
such
lives
at
the
conclusion
of
one
you
were
instantly
reborn
into
another
what
if
you
lived
a
million
a
billion
years
in
this
state
what
if
this
kept
going
forever
did
this
happen
to
jesus
i
dont
think
so
not
from
what
i
heard
he
lived
one
day
of
suffering
and
died
if
the
wages
of
sin
is
the
above
paragraph
then
jesus
didnt
pay
for
our
sins
did
he
id
be
surprised
to
see
the
moderator
let
this
one
through
but
i
seriously
want
a
reasonable
explanation
for
this
ken
