it

us
anything
interesting
statistically
we
want
to
hear
what
kind
of
voices
there
are
out
there
we
are
not
asking
for
full
blown
essays
but
please
give
us
what
you
can
as
i
do
not
read
these
groups
often
please

all
responses
to
me
at
as
my
mail
account

not
infinite
if
you
can
delete
the
questions
and
just
have
numbered
answers
when
you
write
back
i
would
really
appreciate
it
since
we
would
like
to
start
analyzing
the
result
as
soon
as
possible
we
would
like
to
have
the
answers
by
april
if
you
absolutely
can
not
make
it
by
then

we
would
still
liken
to
hear
your
answer

is
interested
in
our
final
project

survey
question
have
you
ever
had
trouble
reconciling
faith
and
reason
if
so
what
was
the
trouble
for
example
have
you
ever
been
unsure
whether
creationism
or
evolutionism
holds
more
truth
do
you
practice
tarot
cards
palm
readings
or
divination
that
conflicts
with
your
scientific
knowledge
of
the
world
does
your
religion
require
you
to
ignore
physical
realities
that
you
have
seen
for
yourself
or
makes
logical
sense
to
you
basically
we
would
like
to
know
if
you
ever
believed
in
something
that
your
reasontells
you
is
wrong

you
have
had
conflict
