the

christians

pardon
me
a
humble
atheist
but
exactly
what
is
the
difference
between
holding
a
revealed
truth
with
blind
faith
as
its
basis
ie
regardless
of
any
evidence
that
you
may
find
to
the
contrary
as
an
absolute
truth
fully
expecting
people
to
believe
you
and
arrogance
they
sound
like
one
and
the
same
to
me
i
see
no
wisdom
whatsoever
in
your
words
im
not
surprised
that
you
see
no
wisdom
in
them
that
is
because
your
premises
are
wrong
from
the
word
go
you
claim
that
christianity
is
based
on
blind
faith
but
this
simply
is
not
so
just
look
at
the
current
thread
on
the
evidence
for
jesus
resurrection
for
evidence
that
jesus
was
real
and
that
he
triumphed
over
death
furthermore
you
say
that
christians
hold
to
their
beliefs
regardless
of
any
evidence
that
you
may
find
to
the
contrary
without
any
evidence
to
support
your
claim
this
statement
is
little
more
than
an
ad
hominem
argument
mind
you
i
dont
mean
this
as
a
personal
attack
im
merely
pointing
out
the
intellectual
dishonesty
behind
condemning
christianity
in
this
fashion
it
would
make
much
more
sense
if
you
could
prove
that
all
christians
do
base
their
belief
on
empty
nothings
and
that
they
do
ignore
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
only
then
can
you
expect
your
attack
to
make
sense
