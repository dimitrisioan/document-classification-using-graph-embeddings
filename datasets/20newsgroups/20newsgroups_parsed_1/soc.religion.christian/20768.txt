re
the
arrogance
of
christians
in
article
writes
but
what
if
the
geologists
are
wrong
and
these
people
are
warning
of
a
nonexistent
danger
analogies
can
only
push
an
argument
so
far
on
both
sides
both
melindas
and
yours
assume
the
premises
used
to
set
up
your
respective
analogies
are
true
and
thus
the
correct
conclusion
will
arise
the
important
point
to
note
is
the
different
directions
both
sides
come
from
christians
believe
they
know
the
truth
and
thus
believe
they
have
the
right
and
duty
to
tell
the
truth
to
all
christians
can
get
offended
if
others
do
not
believe
what
is
selfevidently
to
them
the
truth
nonchristians
do
not
believe
this
is
the
truth
and
get
offended
at
them
because
they
christians
claim
to
know
the
truth
the
analogy
does
not
depend
on
the
premisses
being
true
because
the
question
under
discussion
is
not
truth
but
arrogance
a
similar
analogy
might
be
a
medical
doctor
who
believes
that
a
blood
transfusion
is
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
a
child
whose
parents
are
jehovahs
witnesses
and
so
have
conscientious
objections
to
blood
transfusion
the
doctors
efforts
to
persuade
them
to
agree
to
a
blood
transfusion
could
be
perceived
to
be
arrogant
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
christians
could
be
perceived
to
be
arrogant
the
truth
or
otherwise
of
the
belief
that
a
blood
transfusion
is
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
the
child
is
irrelevant
here
what
matters
is
that
the
doctor
believes
it
to
be
true
and
could
be
seen
to
be
trying
to
foce
his
beliefs
on
the
parents
and
this
could
well
be
perceived
as
arrogance
