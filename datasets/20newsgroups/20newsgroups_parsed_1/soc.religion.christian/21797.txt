hate
the
sin
but
love
the
sinner
my
question
is
whether
that
statement
is
consistent
with
christianity
i
would
think
not
im
very
grateful
for
scotts
reflections
on
this
oftquoted
phrase
could
someone
please
remind
me
of
the
scriptural
source
for
it
its
not
scriptural
but
comes
from
the
patristic
age
i
think
something
about
amare
errantem
interficere
errorem
which
sounds
more
like
love
the
errant
slay
the
error
no
doubt
someone
else
will
know
in
particular
who
minted
the
phrase
if
i
had
to
guess
id
blame
st
augustine
who
seems
to
have
had
a
gift
for
aphorism
richard
aquinas
chonak
sometimes
its
necessary
to
act
as
if
you
believed
