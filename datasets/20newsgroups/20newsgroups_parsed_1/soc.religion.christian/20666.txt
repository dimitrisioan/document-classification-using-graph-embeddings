writes
im
concerned
about
a
recent
posting
about
wbtsil
i
thought
theyd
pretty
much
been
denounced
as
a
rightwing
organization
involved
in
ideological
manipulation
and
cultural
interference
including
vietnam
and
south
america
a
commission
from
mexican
academia
denounced
them
in
as
a
covert
political
and
ideological
institution
used
by
the
us
govt
as
an
instrument
of
control
regulation
penetration
espionage
and
repression
having
met
peter
kingston
of
wbt
some
years
back
he
struck
me
as
an
exemplery
and
dedicated
christian
whose
main
concern
was
with
translation
of
the
word
of
god
and
the
welfare
of
the
people
group
he
was
serving
wbt
literature
is
concerned
mainly
with
providing
scripture
in
minority
languages
the
sort
of
criticism
leveled
at
an
organisation
such
as
this
along
the
lines
of
ideological
manipulation
and
cultural
interference
is
probably
no
more
than
christianising
and
education
in
this
wbt
will
stand
alongside
the
early
christian
missionaries
to
parts
of
africa
or
those
groups
who
worked
among
native
americans
a
couple
hundred
years
ago
my
concern
is
that
this
group
may
be
seen
as
acceptable
and
even
praiseworthy
by
readers
of
socreligionchristian
its
important
that
christians
dont
immediately
accept
every
christian
organization
as
automatically
above
reproach
mp
i
think
you
need
to
substantiate
these
attacks
as
being
a
legitimate
criticism
of
priorities
other
than
spreading
the
gospel
among
underdeveloped
people
