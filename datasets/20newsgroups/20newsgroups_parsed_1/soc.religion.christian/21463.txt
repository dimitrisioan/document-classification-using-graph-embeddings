if

granting
that
i
think
christianity
as
a
relationship
with
jesus
and
a
love
for
god
and
ones
own
soul
stands
just
fine
without
hell
i
dont
believe
or
see
any
evidence
in
scripture
that
hell
is
presented
as
a
stick
with
which
to
beat
people
towards
heaven
i
certainly
agree
with
the
last
paragraph
also
jesuss
statements
on
hell
can
be
treated
as
totally
symbolic
allegorical
or
as
parables
as
was
much
of
his
other
teaching
theres
more
than
enough
hell
here
on
earth
that
we
are
freed
from
by
following
jesus
that
the
rest
just
doesnt
mattter
to
me
and
the
fact
that
we
can
be
free
of
the
hell
here
is
the
best
gift
god
offers
eternal
life
begins
for
us
now
and
we
do
not
wait
to
start
partaking
of
the
divine
nature
and
journeying
on
the
path
to
deification
