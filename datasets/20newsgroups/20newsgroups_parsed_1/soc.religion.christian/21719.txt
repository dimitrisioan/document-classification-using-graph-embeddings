committing
my
life
to
god
hi
everyone
im
trying
to
find
my
way
to
god
but
find
it
difficult
as
i
cant
hear
god
talking
to
me
letting
me
know
that
he
exists
and
is
with
me
and
that
he
knows
me
and
i
feel
that
i
cant
possibly
get
to
know
him
until
he
does
maybe
he
is
talking
to
me
but
i
just
dont
know
or
understand
how
to
listen
some
christians
tell
me
that
in
their
opinion
the
only
way
to
find
god
is
to
take
a
plunge
and
commit
your
life
to
him
and
you
will
discover
this
idea
of
diving
into
the
totally
unknown
is
a
little
bit
frightening
but
i
have
a
few
questions
how
do
you
actually
commit
yourself
if
i
just
say
ok
god
her
you
go
im
committing
my
life
to
you
i
wouldnt
really
feel
that
hed
listened
at
least
i
couldnt
be
sure
that
he
had
so
how
does
one
or
how
did
you
commit
oneself
to
god
in
committing
myself
in
this
way
what
do
i
have
to
forfeit
of
my
current
life
what
can
i
no
longer
do
i
feel
that
im
as
good
as
many
christians
and
i
try
to
uphold
the
idea
of
loving
your
neighbour
i
dont
go
round
killing
people
stealing
etc
and
i
try
not
to
get
jealous
of
other
people
in
any
way
and
i
would
say
that
i
keep
to
the
standards
of
treating
other
people
as
well
as
many
christians
so
what
do
i
have
to
give
up
when
committed
what
do
i
have
to
do
what
does
it
involve
what
if
any
burdens
am
i
taking
on
so
then
whats
the
general
difference
before
and
after
i
assume
that
like
on
your
birthday
you
dont
suddenly
feel
a
year
older
it
wont
suddenly
change
my
life
the
day
i
commit
myself
so
what
happens
how
can
i
be
sure
that
it
is
the
right
thing
to
do
how
can
i
find
out
what
the
it
in
the
last
sentence
actually
is
thanks
very
much
for
all
your
help
in
answering
these
questions
perhaps
email
would
be
a
better
way
to
reply
but
its
up
to
you
