re
why
do
people
become
atheists
in
article
maxwell
c
muir
writes
in
all
candor
i
would
be
happy
to
be
proven
wrong
about
believing
in
atheism
problem
is
i
will
have
to
be
proven
wrong
in
mentioning
some
nonsense
about
psychology
and
atheism
bob
muir
asks
the
following
question
do
i
sound
broken
to
you
i
answer
in
the
affirmative
now
this
answer
might
sound
a
little
intellectually
dishonest
to
bob
but
i
think
i
have
been
accused
before
of
that
heinous
crime
and
am
man
enough
to
take
it
what
thinking
person
has
not
at
one
time
or
other
been
accused
of
it
is
it
politically
correct
for
christians
to
be
the
only
besieged
group
permitted
the
luxury
of
arrogance
now
i
have
a
question
for
bob
why
in
the
world
would
any
selfrespecting
atheist
want
to
subscribe
to
a
christian
news
group
i
have
a
difficult
enough
time
keeping
up
with
it
and
i
think
i
know
something
about
the
subject
bob
reminds
me
of
my
roommate
in
order
to
disbelieve
atheism
he
says
he
will
need
to
be
proven
wrong
about
it
well
i
dont
even
waste
my
time
trying
i
tell
him
that
hell
just
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
in
response
he
tells
me
he
will
say
an
atheists
prayer
for
me
good
luck
bob
and
best
regards
