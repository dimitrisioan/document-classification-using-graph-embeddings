im
inclined
to
read
descriptions
such
as
the
lake
of
fire
as
indicating
annihilation
however
thats
a
minority
view
its
my
personal
view
but
the
only
denominations
i
know
of
that
hold
it
officially
are
the
jws
and
sdas
i
cant
find
the
reference
right
now
but
didnt
cslewis
speculate
somewhere
that
hell
might
be
the
state
of
once
having
been
a
human
soul
why
is
it
that
we
have
this
notion
that
god
takes
some
sort
of
pleasure
from
punishing
people
the
purpose
of
hell
is
to
destroy
the
devil
and
his
angels
to
the
earlier
poster
who
tried
to
support
the
eternal
hell
theory
with
the
fact
that
the
fallen
angels
were
not
destroyed
remember
the
bible
teaches
that
god
has
reserved
them
until
the
day
of
judgement
their
judgement
is
soon
to
come
let
me
suggest
this
maybe
those
who
believe
in
the
eternal
hell
theory
should
provide
all
the
biblical
evidence
they
can
find
for
it
stay
away
from
human
theories
and
only
take
into
account
references
in
the
bible
