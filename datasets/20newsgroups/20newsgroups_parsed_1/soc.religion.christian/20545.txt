if
i
talk
with
an
atheist
and
tell
him
the
new
testament
is
an
historically
reliable
document
what
reasons
would
i
give
him
i
have
found
that
this
isnt
a
very
effective
argument
most
atheists
are
perfectly
willing
to
acknowledge
the
existence
and
ministry
of
jesusbut
are
quite
capable
of
rationalizing
the
miracles
and
the
resurrection
into
misunderstandings
hoaxes
or
simple
fabrications
they
can
always
make
an
analogy
with
the
iliad
a
book
that
tells
the
story
of
the
historical
trojan
war
but
also
talks
about
gods
and
goddesses
and
their
conversations
i
dont
think
its
possible
to
convince
atheists
of
the
validity
of
christianity
through
argument
we
have
to
help
foster
faith
and
an
understanding
of
god
i
could
be
wrongare
there
any
former
atheists
here
who
were
led
to
christianity
by
argument
