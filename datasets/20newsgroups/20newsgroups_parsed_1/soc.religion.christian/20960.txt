subject
re
so
far
so
good
this
may
be
a
really
dumb
one
but
ill
ask
it
anyways
christians
know
that
they
can
never
live
up
to
the
requirements
of
god
right
i
may
be
wrong
but
that
is
my
understanding
but
they
still
try
to
do
it
doesnt
it
seem
like
we
are
spending
all
of
our
lives
trying
to
reach
a
goal
we
can
never
achieve
i
know
that
we
are
saved
by
faith
and
not
by
works
but
does
that
mean
that
once
we
are
saved
we
dont
have
to
do
anything
i
think
james
tells
us
that
faith
without
works
is
dead
paraphrase
how
does
this
work
short
reply
we
can
never
achieve
perfect
health
yet
we
always
strive
for
it
we
dont
seek
to
do
gods
will
because
were
forced
to
we
follow
his
way
because
his
way
is
best
the
reason
its
hard
is
because
we
are
flawed
not
because
hes
unreasonable
but
we
seek
to
follow
his
way
because
we
want
to
improve
ourselves
and
our
lives
