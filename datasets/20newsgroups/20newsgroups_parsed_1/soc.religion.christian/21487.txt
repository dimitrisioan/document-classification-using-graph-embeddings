none
of
the
states
currently
recognize
samesex
marriages
but
i
know
several
couples
whose
marriages
are
more
stable
and
loving

longlasting
than
most
of
my
legally
married
friends
and
relatives
this
drives
one
friends
family
crazy
his
brothers
have
been
divorced
twice
both
his
parents
are
divorced
and
he
the
filthy
gay
has
been
married
to
his
partner
for
years
just
because
those
marriages
are
more
stable
and
loving
and
longlasting
doesnt
make
it
right
samesex
partners
could
have
been
best
friends
