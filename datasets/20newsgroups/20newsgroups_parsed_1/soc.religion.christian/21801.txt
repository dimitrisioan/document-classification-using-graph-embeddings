if
you
arent
christian
and
if
you
have
no
intention
of
ever
becoming
one
why
on
earth
do
you
waste
your
time
and
mine
by
participating
on
a
christian
discussion
list
i
dont
think
we
should
draw
borders
around
newsgroups
christians
are
free
to
read
and
post
entries
on
the
atheist
newsgroups
and
muslims
are
free
to
so
so
in
other
groups
as
well
its
up
to
each
individual
to
define
their
time
schedule
concerning
postings
the
problems
we
all
have
noticed
on
various
newsgroups
is
the
evangelistical
method
of
telling
that
i
am
right
and
you
are
wrong
this
is
true
of
both
theists
and
atheists
hopefully
a
more
constructive
dialogue
between
the
groups
would
help
concerning
assumptions
and
colorization
of
views
