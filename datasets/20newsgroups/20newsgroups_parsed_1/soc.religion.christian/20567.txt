heres
how
i
talk
to
nonchristians
who
are
complaining
about
hell
me
do
you
believe
youre
going
to
heaven
him
i
dont
believe
in
heaven
me
so
are
you
going
there
him
if
there
was
a
heaven
i
would
me
but
since
there
isnt
a
heaven
youre
not
going
there
are
you
him
no
the
point
is
that
heaven
is
based
on
faithif
you
dont
believe
in
heaven
theres
no
way
youre
going
to
be
in
it
hmmm
people
in
the
americas
before
the
time
of
christ
children
who
die
young
etc
of
course
the
next
step
is
i
dont
believe
in
hell
either
so
why
will
i
be
there
it
seems
to
me
that
hell
is
eternal
death
and
seperation
from
god
but
of
course
the
popular
conception
of
hell
correct
or
incorrect
is
something
akin
to
eternal
perpetuation
of
consciousness
at
the
very
least
most
atheists
do
believe
that
when
they
die
they
will
die
forever
and
never
see
godso
they
do
in
fact
believe
that
theyre
going
to
hell
i
think
a
good
number
of
atheists
believe
there
is
nothing
beyond
bodily
death
but
it
is
simply
an
abuse
of
language
to
say
they
believe
theyre
going
to
hell
they
believe
theyre
going
to
die
understand
that
youve
turned
hell
into
a
verb
using
the
same
logic
it
also
follows
that
all
animals
are
going
to
hell
are
you
sure
this
is
what
you
want
to
say
presumably
animals
dont
have
the
opportunity
to
get
to
heaven
but
this
still
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
theyre
going
to
hell
die
a
final
death
i
dont
claim
to
know
whether
or
not
there
is
an
afterlife
of
some
sort
but
if
hell
is
as
you
described
final
death
and
not
eternal
perpetuation
of
consciousness
it
will
be
true
that
there
will
never
be
a
moment
when
i
am
aware
of
my
nonexistence
assuming
i
go
to
hell
and
not
to
heaven
in
other
words
ill
never
know
im
dead
hmmm
hell
doesnt
have
to
be
worse
than
earth
to
be
hellbecause
its
eternal
ever
hear
people
say
of
a
loved
one
who
was
ill
and
has
died
at
least
shes
not
suffering
any
more
shes
in
heaven
now
consider
the
following
statement
at
least
shes
not
suffering
any
more
shes
in
hell
now
the
above
statement
sounds
odd
but
according
to
your
definition
of
hell
it
would
be
a
true
statement
the
person
in
hell
would
not
be
suffering
granted
they
wouldnt
be
anything
wouldnt
be
having
any
conscious
experience
whatsoever
you
say
hell
death
is
eternal
however
this
loses
its
meaning
to
a
dead
person
and
to
me
it
seems
that
the
threat
of
some
sort
of
eternal
punishment
only
makes
sensehas
force
if
one
expects
to
be
conscious
throughout
this
eternity
many
atheists
believe
that
the
thirst
for
an
afterlife
is
simply
the
product
of
propaganda
friend
do
you
want
the
free
gift
of
eternal
life
its
my
understanding
that
the
early
jews
did
not
believe
in
an
afterlife
can
anyone
back
me
up
on
this
combined
with
the
survival
instinct
all
animals
share
the
difference
is
we
have
consciousness
and
once
we
get
the
idea
of
eternal
life
drilled
into
our
brains
we
then
desire
a
sort
of
supersurvival
and
its
a
lot
worse
than
heaven
thats
the
only
comparison
that
matters
that
would
depend
on
what
heaven
is
like
if
god
is
a
king
and
an
eternity
in
heaven
consists
of
giving
thanks
and
praise
to
the
king
i
might
opt
for
hell
i
read
a
lovely
account
of
a
missionary
trying
to
convert
eskimos
to
christianity
in
the
book
the
illusion
of
immortality
by
corliss
lamont
the
missionary
started
to
speak
about
heaven
are
there
seals
in
heaven
will
we
be
able
to
go
hunting
asked
an
eskimo
the
missionary
said
no
the
group
of
eskimos
then
said
something
to
the
effect
of
well
what
good
is
your
heaven
if
theres
no
hunting
scram
i
highly
recommend
the
above
book
ioi
to
anyone
who
wants
an
account
of
the
other
side
of
the
immortality
coin
that
there
is
no
immortality
