re
why
do
people
become
atheists
undoubtedly
people
adopt
atheism
for
many
reasons
but
i
suspect
that
a
biggie
is
that
the
god
theyve
believed
in
is
in
jb
phillipss
words
too
small
if
a
persons
understanding
of
god
is
not
allowed
to
grow
and
develop
it
will
eventually
become
inadequate
the
greyhaired
gentleman
on
a
throne
who
was
a
comforting
image
in
childhood
becomes
a
joke
a
therapist
friend
of
mine
sometimes
suggests
to
her
clients
that
they
fire
god
what
she
means
by
that
is
letting
go
of
an
inadequate
understanding
of
god
to
make
room
for
a
fuller
one
but
she
follows
up
by
encouraging
them
to
hire
a
new
one
my
guess
is
that
a
lot
of
folks
go
through
the
firing
process
but
are
not
adequately
supported
in
the
subsequent
rehire
billh
