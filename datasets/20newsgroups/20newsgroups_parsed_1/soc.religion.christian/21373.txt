hello
all
i
have
a
question
about
satan
i
was
taught
a
long
time
ago
that
satan
was
really
an
angel
of
god
and
was
kicked
out
of
heaven
because
he
challenged
gods
authority
the
problem
is
i
can
not
find
this
in
the
bible
is
it
in
the
bible
if
not
where
did
it
originate
satan
was
one
of
gods
highest
ranking
angels
like
uriel
raphael
michael
and
gabriel
in
fact
his
name
was
satanel
he
did
challenge
gods
authority
and
got
kicked
out
of
heaven
a
lot
of
the
mythology
of
satan

lost
the
el
suffix
when
he
fell
comes
from
the
book
of
enoch
and
is
not
found
in
the
bible
