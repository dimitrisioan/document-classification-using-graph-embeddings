until
recently
i
always
understood
the
term
kingdom
theology
to
mean
the
theology
of
the
kingdom
of
god
but
now
i
have
discovered
that
there
is
a
new
and
more
specialized
meaning
i
gather
that
it
is
also
called
dominion
theology
and
that
it
has
to
do
with
a
belief
that
christians
must
create
a
theocratic
form
of
government
on
earth
before
christ
will
come
again
i
have
not
come
across
anyone
who
believes
or
advocates
this
but
i
am
told
that
it
is
a
very
widespread
belief
in
the
usa
can
anyone
give
me
any
more
information
about
it
here
are
some
of
my
questions
is
it
the
teaching
of
any
particular
denomination
if
so
which
where
and
when
does
it
start
are
there
any
particular
publications
that
propagate
it
are
there
any
organizations
that
propagate
it
