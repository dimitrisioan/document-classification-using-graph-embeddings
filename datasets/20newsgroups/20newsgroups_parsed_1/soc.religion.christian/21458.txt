all
candor
i
would
be
happy
to
be
proven
wrong
about
believing
in
atheism
problem
is
i
will
have
to
be
proven
wrong
in
mentioning
some
nonsense
about
psychology
and
atheism
bob
muir
asks
the
following
question
no
smiley
on
the
part
about
atheism
i
see
do
you
realize
that
your
statement
says
that
i
was
mentioning
nonsense
about
atheism
this
is
hard
for
me
to
defend
against
if
this
is
the
claim
you
are
making
as
you
have
only
included
the
last
two
sentences
of
my
post
and
mentioned
the
first
please
address
the
substance
of
my
post
rather
than
rejecting
it
out
of
hand
but
because
of
the
sometimes
ambiguous
nature
of
english
i
may
be
misinterpreting
your
wording
here
please
clarify
did
you
or
did
you
not
mean
to
call
my
statements
about
atheism
nonsense
if
so
care
to
back
up
that
claim
do
i
sound
broken
to
you
i
answer
in
the
affirmative
ok
then
start
up
the
amatuer
psycology
again
how
am
i
broken
is
it
politically
correct
for
christians
to
be
the
only
besieged
group
permitted
the
luxury
of
arrogance
yawn
excuse
me
i
dont
recall
any
portion
of
my
post
in
which
i
called
christians
arrogant
quote
me
if
i
did
i
do
remember
calling
christianity
silly
and
then
following
that
up
with
information
that
i
was
nine
years
old
when
i
thought
that
i
also
said
that
i
find
faith
to
be
intellectually
dishonest
and
i
would
like
to
see
some
sort
of
proof
of
your
gods
existence
i
define
faith
as
belief
in
the
absense
of
any
proof
btw
also
i
subscribe
to
aa
as
i
mentioned
and
we
see
fundies
of
all
types
there
so
in
answer
to
your
question
no
finally
id
hardly
call
christianity
beseiged
in
this
country
i
seldom
see
christians
ridiculed
for
merely
practising
their
religion
or
wearing
crosses
or
having
christian
bumper
stickers
i
dont
know
for
sure
of
course
i
only
say
i
havent
seen
it
happening
what
i
have
seen
happening
is
my
homosexual
andor
friends
being
beat
up
or
preached
at
by
people
who
claim
to
be
christs
followers
i
know
that
this
sort
of
thing
isnt
practiced
by
the
majority
of
christians
but
it
is
a
very
vocal
minority
who
are
doing
it
and
i
dont
see
comperable
victimization
of
christians
now
i
have
a
question
for
bob
why
in
the
world
would
any
selfrespecting
atheist
want
to
subscribe
to
a
christian
news
group
the
implication
being
that
i
am
not
selfrespecting
of
course
im
not
a
student
of
psychology
btw
but
i
am
a
student
of
creative
writing
and
linguistics
so
literary
analysis
is
my
forte
also
if
the
implications
i
see
are
improper
please
let
me
know
im
here
because
im
not
sequestered
in
my
own
little
atheist
cubbyhole
as
you
seem
to
think
atheists
should
be
did
it
occur
to
you
that
i
dont
think
i
know
everything
and
that
maybe
someone
will
say
something
that
will
change
my
life
have
you
read
my
other
posts
here
or
did
you
see
atheist
and
decide
it
was
time
to
poke
at
someone
who
doesnt
deserve
your
respect
aw
geez
im
sorry
i
probably
am
getting
my
back
up
a
little
too
high
here
its
just
that
the
nonsense
thing
really
annoys
me
i
figure
you
should
see
my
first
reactions
though
since
they
are
my
true
reactions
to
your
question
now
the
smoothed
feather
version
i
seek
all
sorts
of
knowledge
thats
why
i
came
to
my
university
yes
i
am
looking
at
your
religion
well
sorta
i
have
no
idea
what
kind
of
christian
you
are
from
the
outside
and
hopefully
with
an
objective
view
ive
been
trying
to
ask
reasoned
questions
here
because
i
genuinely
dont
know
the
answers
to
them
but
when
i
saw
the
question
directed
at
atheists
i
figured
i
would
answer
after
all
you
can
speculate
about
atheist
motives
here
all
you
want
hence
the
amatuer
psychology
crack
but
without
an
atheist
you
cant
be
sure
of
even
one
atheists
motive
im
hoping
people
really
want
to
know
and
i
was
trying
to
show
that
i
actually
checked
out
several
religions
and
i
actually
read
all
the
pamphlets
people
have
to
offer
and
i
actually
think
about
these
things
instead
im
still
faced
with
the
implication
that
atheism
is
some
kind
of
aberration
and
that
only
broken
people
are
atheist
try
it
from
the
flip
side
i
posit
that
atheism
is
the
natural
state
and
only
broken
people
are
theists
i
offer
as
proof
that
so
many
people
witness
from
horrible
lives
which
picked
up
as
soon
as
they
discovered
their
religion
that
religion
is
regional
if
people
didnt
follow
the
religion
of
their
areas
there
would
be
a
more
homogenous
mix
so
many
terrorists
claim
theistic
motives
and
that
theists
tend
to
be
so
pushy
and
angry
when
challenged
on
altatheism
why
are
religions
so
successful
because
there
is
so
much
suffering
in
the
world
which
breaks
people
its
an
uncomfortable
situation
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
which
is
another
reason
im
here
to
try
to
see
the
flip
side
of
my
thinking
and
also
as
a
watchdog
for
logical
fallacies
i
have
a
difficult
enough
time
keeping
up
with
it
and
i
think
i
know
something
about
the
subject
the
implication
here
being
that
atheists
cant
possibly
know
anything
about
christianity
probably
jumping
at
shadows
again
but
i
think
my
reaction
is
somewhat
justified
after
all
the
first
post
suggested
that
atheists
are
broken
hostile
people
this
post
confirms
that
someone
else
believes
it
bob
reminds
me
of
my
roommate
in
order
to
disbelieve
atheism
he
says
he
will
need
to
be
proven
wrong
about
it
well
he
got
me
there
i
am
a
strong
atheist
because
i
feel
that
lack
of
evidence
especially
about
something
like
an
omnipotent
being
implies
lack
of
existence
however
i
havent
met
the
strong
atheist
yet
who
said
that
nothing
could
ever
persuade
him
call
me
a
seeker
if
you
like
i
dont
weak
atheism
is
being
ignore
here
though
some
atheists
simply
say
i
dont
believe
in
any
god
rather
than
my
position
i
believe
that
no
gods
exist
for
the
weak
atheist
the
is
no
atheism
to
disbelieve
because
they
dont
actively
believe
in
atheism
if
you
think
this
is
confusing
try
figuring
out
the
difference
between
protestants
and
methodists
from
an
atheist
point
of
view
this
is
another
fallacy
many
theists
seem
to
have
that
everyone
believes
in
something
followed
up
by
everyone
has
faith
in
something
guess
what
my
atheism
ends
the
moment
im
shown
a
proof
of
some
gods
existence
is
that
really
too
much
to
ask
well
i
dont
even
waste
my
time
trying
well
i
guess
you
wont
succeed
in
converting
him
or
me
why
the
supposition
that
you
will
fail
to
convince
him
amatuer
psycology
on
is
it
because
you
yourself
are
unconvinced
i
tell
him
that
hell
just
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
and
i
told
you
that
i
find
faith
to
be
intellectually
dishonest
note
that
i
can
only
speak
for
myself
if
you
find
faith
to
be
honest
show
me
how
i
have
been
unable
to
reconcile
it
so
far
maybe
thats
how
im
broken
i
tell
you
that
i
have
invisible
fairies
living
in
my
garden
and
that
you
should
just
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
accept
that
you
are
of
a
fundamentally
different
mind
than
i
and
i
really
would
like
to
know
how
you
think
all
i
ask
for
is
proof
of
the
assertion
god
exists
logical
or
physical
proofs
only
please
then
well
discuss
the
nature
of
god
in
response
he
tells
me
he
will
say
an
atheists
prayer
for
me
prayer
uh
oh
well
have
to
revoke
his
atheist
club
card
and
beanie
good
luck
bob
and
best
regards
good
luck
to
you
as
well
and
again
i
apologize
if
the
inferences
i
made
were
inaccurate
