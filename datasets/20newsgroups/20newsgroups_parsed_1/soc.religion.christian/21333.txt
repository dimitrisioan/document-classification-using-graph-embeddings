re
the
bible
available
in
every
language
was
re
satanic
tounges
in
article
allen
koberg
writes
about
tongues
the
concept
of
tongues
as
used
at
pentecost
seems
an
outdated
concept
now
with
the
bible
available
in
nearly
every
language
and
missionaries
who
are
out
there
in
all
languages
why
does
the
church
need
tongues
i
guess
there
are
at
least
some
people
who
are
not
able
to
support
this
claim
there
are
still
a
lot
of
languages
without
the
bible
or
a
part
of
the
bible
there
are
still
many
languages
which
we
are
not
able
to
write
simply
because
the
written
version
of
the
language
has
not
yet
been
defined
i
guess
this
is
one
of
the
main
goals
for
wycliffe
bible
translators
to
define
rules
and
a
grammar
for
writing
the
rest
of
the
languages
of
this
world
i
do
not
see
that
any
of
them
will
have
any
reason
to
become
unemployed
during
the
foreseeable
future
provided
they
get
their
neccessary
support
and
still
they
are
one
of
the
largest
missionary
organizations
of
the
world
