revelations
phil
launchbury
writes
the
apostate
church
of
revelation
most
likely
refers
to
the
st
century
jews
who
rejected
their
messiah
and
had
him
crucified
john
refers
to
them
im
afraid
not
it
refers
to
the
church
that
christ
founded
many
many
times
he
warns
that
the
church
will
fall
away
into
heresy
as
do
the
apostles
for
an
example
look
at
the
parables
in
matthew
they
refer
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
church
and
the
process
of
how
they
will
be
corrupted
sorry
but
i
think
this
interpretation
of
the
matthew
parables
is
nonsense
ie
yeast
always
stands
for
sincorruptionheresy
for
example
beware
of
the
yeast
of
the
pharisees
matthew
explains
that
by
leaven
of
the
pharisees
jesus
was
simply
referring
to
their
teaching
not
sincorruptionheresy
jesus
gaves
his
apostles
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
and
said
that
the
gates
of
hell
would
not
prevail
against
his
church
