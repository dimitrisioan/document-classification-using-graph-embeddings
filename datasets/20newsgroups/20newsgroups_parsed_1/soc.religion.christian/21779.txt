re
st
maria
goretti
after
reading
this
story
about
st
maria
goretti
posted
two
weeks
ago
i
am
a
bit
confused
while
it
is
clear
that
her
daily
life
is
one
of
probity
and
sanctity
i
am
afraid
i
dont
quite
understand
the
final
episode
of
her
life
i
am
reading
it
correctly
she
and
the
church
apparently
felt
that
being
raped
was
a
sin
on
her
part
one
so
perfidious
that
she
would
rather
die
than
commit
it
if
this
is
the
case
im
afraid
that
i
disagree
rather
strongly
can
anyone
out
there
explain
this
one
to
me
yours

christ
