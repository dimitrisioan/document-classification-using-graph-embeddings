re
homosexuality
issues
in
christianity
we
are
all
still
human
we
dont
know
it
all
but
homosexual
or
heterosexual
we
all
strive
to
follow
jesus
the
world
is
dying
and
needs
to
hear
about
jesus
christ
gaining
entry
into
heaven
can
not
be
done
without
first
being
cleansed
by
the
blood
of
jesus
sin
can
not
dwell
in
heaven
it
is
against
the
natural
laws
of
god
being
converted
to
christianity
means
being
baptized
by
the
holy
spirit
you
can
not
get
to
heaven
by
good
works
only
because
of
the
union
with
the
holy
spirit
the
mans
behavior
will
change
if
there
is
true
union
he
will
not
desire
to
be
homosexual
fornication
and
homosexuality
will
leave
your
life
if
you
are
truly
baptized
by
the
holy
spirit
its
not
to
say
that
we
dont
stumble
now
and
then
