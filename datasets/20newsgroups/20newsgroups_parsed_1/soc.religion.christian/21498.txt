re
atheists
and
hell
imagine
the
worst
depth
of
despair
youve
ever
encountered
or
the
worst
physical
pain
youve
ever
experienced
some
people
suffer
such
emotional
physical
and
mental
anguish
in
their
lives
that
their
deaths
seem
to
be
merciful
but
at
least
the
pain
does
end
in
death
what
if
you
lived
a
hundred
such
lives
at
the
conclusion
of
one
you
were
instantly
reborn
into
another
what
if
you
lived
a
million
a
billion
years
in
this
state
what
if
this
kept
going
forever
did
this
happen
to
jesus
i
dont
think
so
not
from
what
i
heard
he
lived
one
day
of
suffering
and
died
if
the
wages
of
sin
is
the
above
paragraph
then
jesus
didnt
pay
for
our
sins
did
he
this
is
something
ive
always
found
a
little
curious
ive
never
quite
understood
the
trinity
thing
on
the
one
hand
jesus
is
supposed
to
be
god
incarnate
but
at
the
same
time
he
is
gods
son
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
first
question
is
if
jesus
was
god
in
human
form
how
could
he
really
be
gods
son
if
the
holy
ghost
planted
the
seed
in
mary
so
to
speak
then
it
seems
that
jesus
relationship
to
god
would
be
the
equivalent
to
the
human
fatherson
relationship
while
a
son
might
inherit
alot
of
the
fathers
qualities
he
is
not
the
father
they
are
still
two
separite
entities
to
try
and
say
that
a
son
is
the
same
person
as
the
father
is
obviously
wrong
in
that
case
jesus
and
god
arent
the
same
on
the
other
hand
if
their
relationship
isnt
the
same
as
the
human
fatherson
relationship
but
jesus
is
actually
god
incarnate
then
hes
not
really
gods
son
and
he
never
was
hes
just
god
manifesting
himself
as
jesus
at
least
this
is
how
im
seeing
it
can
someone
who
is
more
knowledgeable
about
the
trinity
enlighten
us
getting
back
to
the
original
question
what
is
the
great
price
that
jesus
paid
to
redeem
our
sins
was
it
dying
on
the
cross
since
jesus
knew
that
he
would
rise
again
in
days
and
then
ascend
back
to
heaven
i
have
a
hard
time
seeing
how
this
is
considered
paying
such
a
great
price
for
humanity
his
earthly
body
may
have
been
killed
but
then
so
what
he
suffered
a
few
hours
of
physical
pain
but
then
there
has
been
many
a
human
who
has
suffered
a
great
deal
more
the
fact
that
jesus
was
gods
only
begotten
son
doesnt
seem
to
me
to
have
much
meaning
since
god
can
beget
as
many
sons
as
he
wants
to
jesus
being
the
only
one
was
simply
a
matter
of
choice
i
suspect
that
these
questions
will
be
very
offensive
to
many
christians
on
this
net
to
those
people
please
accept
my
sincere
apologies
it
is
not
my
intention
to
offend
or
to
trivialize
christ
but
i
do
believe
these
are
legitimate
questions
and
i
am
genuinely
curious
note
that
the
trinity
and
incarnation
have
to
be
looked
at
together
first
your
reading
of
the
virgin
birth
is
an
uncommon
one
in
this
group
its
dangerous
to
say
that
no
one
believes
something
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
the
jesus
is
gods
son
in
a
physical
sense
with
the
holy
spirit
as
father
and
mary
as
mother
i
consider
that
terrible
heresy
though
some
people
react
less
violently
the
virgin
birth
says
that
jesus
birth
is
gods
responsibility
but
it
doesnt
imply
that
gods
sperm
was
involved
indeed
one
though
by
no
means
the
only
speculation
is
that
god
used
josephs
genetic
material
second
jesus
is
in
some
sense
doubly
indirect
from
the
father
in
a
trinitarian
context
the
term
son
refers
to
the
eternal
logos
who
is
a
part
of
god
the
son
didnt
come
into
existence
with
jesus
birth
jesus
is
the
incarnation
of
the
son
so
his
sonness
isnt
specifically
a
result
of
being
incarnated
rather
its
the
son
who
was
incarnated
