i
think
youre
talking
about
the
assumption
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
it
says
that
the
immaculate
mother
of
god
the
ever
virgin
mary
having
completed
the
course
of
her
earthly
life
was
assumed
body
and
soul
into
heavenly
glory
this
was
defined
by
a
papal
statement
in
though
it
had
certainly
been
believed
by
some
before
that
clh
so
true
im
not
sure
of
the
basis
of
the
belief
but
it
was
a
widely
held
belief
among
the
laity
of
the
rc
church
and
their
support
of
it
lead
to
it
being
declared
to
be
true
basically
the
teaching
on
infallibility
holds
that
the
pope
is
infallible
in
matters
of
faith
and
doctrine
the
college
of
bishops
is
likewise
infallible
and
the
laity
is
as
well
the
pope
gets
most
of
the
attentioncriticism
but
the
consensus
of
the
other
bodies
is
equally
infallible
according
to
rc
teaching
