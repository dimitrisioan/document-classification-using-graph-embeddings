paul

jr
writes
i
think
we
must
be
careful
before
we
totally
throw
out
leviticus
if
the
law
is
reflection
of
gods
character
and
true
holy
nature
then
those
who
say
that
god
endorses
homosexuality
run
into
a
problem
though
this
will
be
addressed
in
the
series
of
articles
im
posting
now
under
aresnokoitia
i
cant
wait
this
just
really
blew
my
socks
off
read
i
tim
verses
speaks
against
those
who
have
perverted
the
teachings
of
the
mosaic
law
in
vv
we
have
in
order
the
th
thru
the
th
commandments
and
in
the
midst
of
this
listing
is
homosexuals
the
decalogue
above
everything
else
is
seen
as
gods
absolute
if
you
dont
believe
in
absolutes
then
you
have
nothing
do
do
with
jehovah
of
the
ot
which
paul
reveals
to
be
the
messiah
of
the
nt
lord
christ
jesus
transliterates
to
read
jehovahs
anointed
savior
in
i
cor
we
see
the
same
emphasis
of
moral
separation
from
the
pagan
gentiles
as
we
do
in
lev
in
i
cor
only
one
notation
drunkards
is
not
found
in
lev
paul
was
not
naive
in
his
use
of
the
lxx
he
knew
full
well
how
he
was
using
the
law
of
god
that
was
given
in
the
ot
for
application
in
the
nt
as
ive
said
the
law
was
fulfilled
not
done
away
with
of
questions
we
are
trying
to
deal
with
he
encountered
homosexuality
only
in
contexts
where
most
people
would
probably
agree
that
it
was
wrong
he
had
never
faced
the
experience
of
christians
who
try
to
act
straight
and
fail
and
he
had
never
faced
christians
who
are
trying
to
define
a
christian
homosexuality
which
fits
with
general
christian
ideals
of
fidelity
and
of
seeing
sexuality
as
a
mirror
of
the
relationship
between
god
and
man
it
is
unfair
to
take
pauls
judgement
on
homosexuality
among
idolaters
and
use
it
to
make
judgements
on
these
questions
this
understanding
is
thoroughly
rebutted
in
deyoungs
article
that
is
being
posted
please
refer
to
it
one
of
the
reasons
that
some
of
us
do
not
accept
that
common
argument
is
because
paul
probably
did
face
this
and
other
problems
we
can
do
better
than
probably
which
is
not
an
adequate
defense
against
the
statement
that
pauls
culture
didnt
have
the
same
understanding
of
homosexuality
as
ours
again
read
the
article
because
it
uses
facts
i
claim
that
the
question
of
how
to
counsel
homosexual
christians
is
not
entirely
a
theological
issue
but
also
a
pastoral
one
i
dont
see
how
you
come
to
that
conclusion
i
think
i
do
because
i
have
worked
in
the
homosexual
community
by
means
of
working
with
aids
patients
the
pastoral
is
merely
the
practical
application
of
the
theological
truth
however
those
who
are
working
thru
the
issue
of
homosexuality
need
to
have
our
love
and
understanding
just
as
with
a
friend
who
is
contiplating
cheating
on
his
wife
or
a
friend
who
lives
with
his
girlfriend
yet
you
continue
to
witness
to
him
but
once
the
choice
is
made
and
there
is
no
remorse
then
i
feel
that
pauls
pastoral
care
as
presented
in
the
corinthian
church
come
to
bear
significance
the
one
in
active
rebellion
should
be
placed
outside
of
the
church
if
a
believer
and
if
a
nonbeliever
then
one
wipes
his
sandels
and
leaves
it
in
gods
hand
if
there
was
a
member
in
your
youth
group
who
was
constantly
pawing
at
the
little
girls
you
wouldnt
hesitate
to
deal
with
the
matter
quickly
and
decisivly
that
in
part
betrays
the
present
political
correctness
of
the
issue
pederasty
is
not
accepted
at
the
present
but
some
how
we
are
to
accept
homosexuality
because
the
latter
is
politically
correct
while
the
former
is
not
at
least
not
yet
this
is
how
the
morals
decay
i
guess
this
would
follow
the
liberal
application
in
the
political
realm
of
economics
the
liberals
want
to
tax
the
rich
in
the
federal
yet
in
their
own
states
when
they
try
to
get
businesses
to
settle
there
they
give
tax
incentives
to
these
same
richies
it
comes
down
to
a
moral
code
of
relativeness
or
to
use
the
cultural
thing
politically
correct
at
the
moment
rex
you
might
want
to
look
over
tim
again
if
this
is
really
the
th
through
th
commandments
we
seem
to
be
missing
thieves
and
homosexuals
would
have
to
be
fit
in
under
adultery
this
is
of
course
possible
if
arsenokoitia
has
a
narrower
meaning
than
homosexuality
in
general
but
i
think
thats
not
your
thesis
i
have
no
objection
per
se
to
the
idea
that
the
author
of
tim
might
have
quoted
the
commandments
but
through
minus
one
and
plus
a
few
things
begins
to
look
a
bit
marginal
