anyone
who
thinks
being
gay
and
christianity
are
not
compatible
should
check
out
dignity
integrity
more
light
presbyterian
churches
affirmation
mcc
churches
etc
meet
some
gay
christians
find
out
who
they
are
pray
with
them
discuss
scripture
with
them
and
only
then
form
your
opinion
also
check
out
the
episcopal
church
although
by
no
means
all
episcopalians
are
sympathetic
to
homosexual
men
and
women
there
certainly
is
a
fairly
large
percentage
in
my
experience
who
are
i
am
good
friends
with
an
episcopalian
minister
who
is
ordained
and
living
in
a
monogamous
homosexual
relationship
this
in
no
way
diminishes
his
ability
to
minister
in
fact
he
has
a
very
significant
ministry
with
the
gay
and
lesbian
association
of
his
community
as
well
as
a
very
significant
aids
ministry
this
may
sound
argumentative
but
do
the
prohomosexual
crowd
give
the
same
support
to
church
members
that
are
involved
in
incestuous
relationships
if
we
do
a
little
substitution
above
we
get
although
by
no
means
all
episcopalians
are
sympathetic
to
incestuous
men
and
women
there
certainly
is
a
fairly
larget
percentage
in
my
experience
who
are
i
am
good
friends
with
an
episcopalian
minister
who
is
ordained
and
living
in
a
monogamous
incestual
relationship
this
in
no
way
diminishes
his
ability
to
minister
in
fact
he
has
a
very
significant
ministry
with
the
incest
association
of
his
community
do
the
same
standards
apply
if
not
why
not
and
while
were
in
the
ballpark
what
about
bestiality
i
cant
recall
offhand
if
there
are
any
direct
statements
in
the
bible
regarding
sex
with
animals
does
that
activity
have
more
or
less
a
sanction
please
avoid
responses
such
as
youre
taking
this
to
extremes
i
would
guess
that
a
disproportionate
percentage
of
the
inerrant
bible
community
views
homosexual
acts
with
distaste
in
the
same
manner
that
society
at
large
views
incest
scott
cokely
they
came
for
the
davidians
but
i
did
not
speak
up
because
i
was
not
a
davidian
then
they
came
for
me
opinions
expressed
are
mine
and
do
not
represent
those
of
rockwell
obviously
you
can
replace
homosexuality
in
the
above
statement
by
anything
from
murder
to
sleeping
late
that
doesnt
mean
that
the
same
people
would
accept
those
substitutions
the
question
is
whether
the
relationships
involved
do
in
fact
form
an
appropriate
vehicle
to
represent
christs
relationship
to
humanity
this
is
at
least
partly
an
empirical
question
in
some
cases
types
of
human
relationship
have
been
rejected
because
over
time
they
always
seem
to
lead
to
trouble
i
think
thats
the
case
with
slavery
one
can
argue
that
in
theory
if
you
follow
pauls
guidelines
its
possible
to
have
christian
slaveholders
but
in
practice
over
a
period
of
time
most
people
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nobody
can
really
have
that
degree
of
control
over
another
and
not
abuse
it
the
message
you
were
responding
to
was
asking
you
to
look
at
the
results
from
christian
communities
that
endorse
homosexuality
note
christian
homosexuals
not
people
you
see
on
the
news
advocating
some
extremist
agenda
you
may
not
want
to
base
your
decision
completely
on
that
kind
of
observation
but
i
would
argue
that
its
at
least
relevant
you
cant
answer
the
request
by
asking
why
you
shouldnt
look
at
the
incest
association
because
in
fact
there
is
no
such
association
if
there
were
it
might
be
reasonable
for
you
to
look
at
it
too
of
course
that
doesnt
mean
that
the
results
of
all
such
examinations
would
necessarily
come
out
the
same
way
part
of
why
there
arent
groups
pushing
all
possible
relaxed
standards
is
that
some
of
them
do
produce
obviously
bad
results
