homosexual
christians
have
indeed
checked
out
these
verses
some
of
them
are
used
against
us
only
through
incredibly
perverse
interpretations
others
simply
do
not
address
the
issues
you
would
seem
to
be
more
in
need
of
a
careful
and
spiritled
course
in
exegesis
than
most
of
the
gay
christians
i
know
i
suggest
that
you
stop
prooftexting
about
things
you
know
nothing
about
let
me
say
that
the
life
death
and
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
is
central
to
christianity
if
you
personally
believe
that
jesus
christ
died
for
you
you
are
a
part
of
the
christian
body
of
believers
we
are
all
still
human
we
dont
know
it
all
but
homosexual
or
heterosexual
we
all
strive
to
follow
jesus
the
world
is
dying
and
needs
to
hear
about
jesus
christ
are
you
working
together
with
other
christians
to
spread
the
gospel
