when
are
two
people
married
in
gods
eyes
i
would
like
to
get
your
opinions
on
this
when
exactly
does
an
engaged
couple
become
married
in
gods
eyes
some
say
that
if
the
two
have
publically
announced
their
plans
to
marry
have
made
their
vows
to
god
and
are
unswervingly
committed
to
one
another
i
realize
this
is
a
subjective
qualifier
they
are
marriedjoined
in
gods
sight
suppose
they
are
unable
to
get
before
the
altar
right
at
the
current
time
because
of
purely
logistical
reasons
beyond
their
control
what
do
you
think
about
this
post
or
email
me
with
general
responses
if
you
need
clarification
as
to
what
i
am
asking
please
email
thanks
and
god
bless
