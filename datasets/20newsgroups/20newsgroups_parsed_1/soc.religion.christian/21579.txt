seeing
as
how
thetwobabylons
has
been
brought
up
again
it
is
time
for
me
to
respond
once
again
and
say
that
this
book
is
junk
it
is
nothing
more
that
an
anticatholic
tract
of
the
sort
published
ever
since
the
there
were
protestants
its
scholarship
is
phony
and
its
assertions
spurious

is
no
peace
but
strife
closed
in

the
marvlous
peace
of
