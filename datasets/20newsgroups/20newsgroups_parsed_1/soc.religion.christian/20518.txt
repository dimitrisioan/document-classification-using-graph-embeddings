easter
whats
in
a
name
was
re
new
testament
double
standard
seanna
sm
watson
writes
in
quebec
french
the
word
for
the
celebration
of
the
resurrection
is
paquesthis
is
etymologically
related
to
pesach
passover
and
the
pascal
lamb
so
is
the
french
canadian
mostly
roman
catholic
celebration
better
because
it
uses
the
right
name
i
was
at
my
parents
seder
and
noticed
the
labelling
on
one
of
the
packages
was
english
hebrew
and
french
in
the
phrase
kosher
for
passover
the
french
word
used
was
paques
weve
deliberately
mistranslated
this
at
the
kulikauskas
home
and
keep
referring
to
foods
being
kosher
for
easter
back
to
the
original
questions
in
this
thread
concerning
christians
of
jewish
descent
and
the
law
i
always
wonder
when
i
see
posts
on
this
subject
whether
the
writers
are
christians
of
jewish
descent
relating
the
lifedecisions
god
has
led
them
to
or
people
who
take
only
an
academic
interest
in
the
topic
having
known
seanna
since
she
was
nine
years
old
i
do
know
in
this
case
i
admit
that
the
answer
to
this
question
affects
the
amount
of
weight
i
give
to
the
writers
statement
