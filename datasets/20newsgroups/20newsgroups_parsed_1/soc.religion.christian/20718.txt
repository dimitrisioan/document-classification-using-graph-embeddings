dan

asked
for
evidence
that
the
most
effective
abuse
recovery
programs
involve
meeting
peoples
spiritual
needs
i
responded
in
step
programs
like
alcoholics
anonymous
one
of
the
steps
involves
acknowleding
a
higher
power
aa
and
other
step
abuse
recovery
programs
are
acknowledged
as
being
among
the
most
effective
dan
johnson
clarified
what
i
was
asking
is
this
please
show
me
that
the
most
effective
substanceabsure
recovery
programs
involve
meetinsg
peoples
spiritual
needs
rather
than
merely
attempting
to
fill
peoples
spiritual
needs
as
percieved
by
the
people
aa
src
regulars
or
snoopy
you
are
asking
me
to
provide
objective
proof
for
the
existence
of
god
i
never
claimed
to
be
able
to
do
this
in
fact
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
do
so
i
consider
the
existence
of
god
to
be
a
premise
or
assumption
that
underlies
my
philosophy
of
life
it
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
faith
if
i
werent
a
christian
i
would
be
an
agnostic
but
i
have
sufficient
subjective
evidence
to
justify
and
sustain
my
relationship
with
god
again
this
is
a
matter
of
premises
and
assumptions
i
assume
that
there
is
more
to
life
the
universe
and
everything
than
materialism
ie
that
spirituality
exists
this
assumption
answers
the
question
about
why
i
have
apparent
spiritual
needs
i
find
this
assumption
consistent
with
my
subsequent
observat
ions
i
then
find
that
god
fills
these
spiritual
needs
but
i
can
not
objectively
prove
the
difference
between
apparent
filling
of
imagined
spiritual
needs
and
real
filling
of
real
spiritual
needs
nor
can
i
prove
to
another
person
that
they
have
spiritual
needs
