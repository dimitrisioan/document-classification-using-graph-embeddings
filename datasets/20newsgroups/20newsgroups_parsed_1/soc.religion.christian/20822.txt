re
the
arrogance
of
christians
in
a
previous
article
melinda

says
well
the
argument
usually
stops
right
there
in
the
end
arent
we
all
just
kids
groping
for
the
truth
if
so
do
we
have
the
authority
to
declare
all
other
beliefs
besides
our
own
as
false
if
i
dont
think
my
belief
is
right
and
everyone
elses
belief
is
wrong
then
i
dont
have
a
belief
this
is
simply
what
belief
means
where
does
the
authority
for
a
belief
come
from
nowhere
for
a
belief
is
itself
authoratative
if
i
produce
authority
for
a
belief
where
will
i
find
authority
for
my
belief
in
the
legitimacy
of
the
authority
in
short
the
mind
has
to
start
somewhere
by
the
way
the
majority
of
christians
ie
catholics
believe
in
the
authority
of
the
church
and
derive
the
authority
of
the
bible
from
its
acceptance
by
the
church
mark
baker
the
task
is
not
to
cut
down
jungles
but
to
irrigate
deserts
