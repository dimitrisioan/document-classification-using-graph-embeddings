i
find
that
i
am
dissatisfied
with
the
little
purposes
that
we
can
manufacture
for
ourselves
little
in
the
cosmic
sense
ah
in
the
cosmic
sence
but
who
lives
in
the
cosmic
sence
not
me
cosmicly
we
dont
even
exist
for
all
practical
purposes
i
can
hardly
use
the
cosmic
sence
of
stuff
as
a
guide
to
life
it
would
just
say
dont
bother
luckily
for
mortals
there
are
many
sences
of
scale
you
can
talk
about
in
a
human
sence
you
can
have
big
purposes
even
the
greatest
of
the
great
pharos
are
long
gone
the
pyramids
historical
oddities
being
worn
down
by
the
wind
eventually
to
be
turned
into
dust
but
the
influence
of
aristotle
confucious
alexander
ceasar
and
countless
others
is
still
with
us
although
their
works
have
perished
but
they
have
changed
to
course
of
history
and
while
humanity
exists
their
deeds
can
not
be
said
to
have
come
to
nothing
even
if
they
are
utterly
forgotten
mankind
itself
will
one
day
perish
one
day
surely
well
unless
you
believe
in
the
second
coming
which
i
do
not
but
in
that
time
we
can
make
a
difference
without
some
interconnectedness
that
transcends
the
physical
without
god
it
is
all
pointless
in
the
end
in
the
end
but
it
must
be
the
end
until
then
there
is
all
the
point
you
can
muster
and
when
that
end
comes
there
will
be
nobody
to
ask
gee
i
dont
think
james
sledds
deeds
are
gon
na
make
much
of
a
difference
ulitmately
ya
know
but
they
will
have
already
have
made
a
difference
great
or
small
before
the
end
why
must
your
ends
be
eternal
to
be
worthwhile
most
people
are
able
to
live
with
that
and
for
them
little
purposes
success
money
power
effecting
change
helping
others
suffice
little
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
of
course
i
suppose
they
never
think
about
the
cosmic
scale
or
are
at
least
able
to
put
it
out
of
their
minds
i
dont
doubt
it
but
i
have
thought
about
the
cosmic
scale
and
it
does
not
seem
to
mean
much
to
us
here
today
to
me
it
is
comforting
to
know
that
reality
is
an
illusion
i
would
not
find
this
comforting
but
perhaps
it
is
merely
my
definitions
heres
what
i
think
the
relevant
terms
are
reality
that
which
is
real
illusion
that
which
is
not
real
but
seems
to
be
real
objectively
existing
for
reality
to
be
an
illusion
would
mean
then
that
which
is
real
is
not
real
but
seems
to
be
or
that
which
objectively
exists
does
not
objectively
exist
but
does
seem
to
objectively
exist
from
which
we
can
conclude
that
unless
you
want
to
get
a
contradiction
that
no
things
objectively
exist
but
i
have
a
problem
with
this
because
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
objectively
exist
if
nothing
else
cogito
ergo
sum
and
all
that
perhaps
you
do
not
mean
all
that
but
rather
mean
objective
reality
is
unreachable
by
humans
which
is
not
so
bad
and
so
far
as
i
know
is
true
that
the
true
reality
underneath
the
the
physical
is
spirit
have
on
if
reality
is
an
illusion
isnt
true
reality
an
illusion
too
and
if
true
reality
is
spirit
doenst
that
make
spirit
an
illusion
as
well
if
i
am
not
distinctly
confused
this
is
getting
positively
buddhist
that
this
world
is
a
school
of
sorts
where
we
learn
and
grow
and
our
souls
mature
that
is
one
hell
of
a
statement
although
perhaps
true
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
it
was
intended
to
be
so
if
so
please
show
that
this
is
true
if
not
please
explain
how
this
can
give
a
purpose
to
anything
that
gives
a
purpose
to
my
little
purposes
how
does
it
do
that
wouldnt
the
worldschool
w
intent
idea
make
the
world
a
preparation
for
some
greater
purpose
rather
than
a
purpose
in
itself
and
takes
some
of
the
pressure
off
what
pressure
its
not
so
necessary
to
make
this
life
a
success
in
human
terms
if
youre
really
just
here
to
learn
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
a
success
in
human
terms
unless
your
goals
either
include
doing
so
or
require
doing
so
before
they
themselves
can
be
achived
indeed
many
people
have
set
goals
for
themselves
that
do
not
include
success
in
human
terms
as
i
understand
it
check
out
yer
buddhist
monk
type
guy
out
for
nirvana
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
its
more
important
to
progress
grow
persist
to
learn
to
love
yourself
and
others
and
to
express
your
love
especially
when
its
dificult
to
do
so
honest
effort
is
rewarded
by
god
he
knows
our
limitations
why
is
learning
to
love
a
goal
what
happens
if
you
fail
in
this
goal
to
you
to
god
to
the
mysterious
purpose
deletia
question
about
immortailty
and
my
answer
deleted
because
it
was
mostly
quote
two
serious
questionsinvitations
to
discussion
what
is
the
nature
of
eternal
life
how
can
we
as
mortals
locked
into
space
time
conceive
of
it
possible
answer
for
the
best
we
can
do
is
metaphoranalogy
question
a
what
is
the
best
metaphor
ill
have
a
crack
at
that
the
nature
of
eternal
life
is
neatly
described
by
its
name
it
is
the
concept
of
life
without
death
life
without
end
no
we
can
put
together
word
to
describe
it
but
we
can
not
imagine
it
a
no
metaphor
is
adequate
next
to
eternity
if
it
were
we
could
not
understand
it
either
or
so
i
suspect
dan
johnson
and
god
said
jeeze
this
is
dull
and
it
was
dull
genesis
these
opinions
probably
show
what
i
know
