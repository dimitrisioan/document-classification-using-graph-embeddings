writes
this
verse
also
makes
me
think
of
the
kind
of
husband
who
decides
what
is
gods
will
for
his
family
without
consulting
his
wife
god
reveals
his
will
to
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
there
needs
to
be
some
degree
of
mutuality
in
decision
making
even
those
whose
understanding
of
the
bible
leads
to
a
belief
in
an
authoritarian
headship
of
the
husband
need
to
incorporate
this
in
order
to
have
a
functional
family
one
way
to
look
at
it
is
that
god
speaks
to
the
wife
through
the
husband
and
to
the
husband
through
the
wife

i
agree
god
makes
the
husband
the
head
of
the
house
but
he
surely
cant
do
it
alone
he
needs
the
help
of
his
beloved
wife
whom
the
lord
gave
him
at
least
thats
how
it
is
in
my
house
i
thank
god
for
the
beautiful
woman
he
has
brought
into
my
life
i
couldnt
lead
without
the
help
of
my
wonderful
wife
john
emery
i
will
praise
you
o
lord
my
god
with
all
my
heart
i
will
glorify
your
name
forever
for
great
is
your
love
toward
me
you
have
delivered
me
from
the
depths
of
the
grave
psalm
