indeed
lds
doctrine
goes
one
step
further
and
in
some
cases
holds
parents
responsible
for
their
childrens
sins
if
they
have
failed
to
bring
them
up
properly
cf

hi
bruce
how
do
you
reconcile
this
practice
with
ezekiel
ezekiel
the
soul
who
sins
is
the
one
who
will
die
the
son
will
not
share
the
guilt
of
the
father
nor
will
the
father
share
the
guilt
of
the
son
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
man
will
be
credited
to
him
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
will
be
charged
against
him
actually
in
dc
the
parents
are
being
held
accountable
for
their
own
sins
specifically
they
are
accountable
for
their
failure
to
teach
their
children
properly
if
i
fail
to
teach
my
children
that
stealing
is
wrong
then
i
am
responsible
for
their
theft
if
they
later
indulge
in
such
behavior
this
is
very
similar
to
the
instructions
ezekiel
was
given
in
eze
if
ezekiel
failed
to
do
his
duty
and
warn
the
wicked
not
only
would
the
wicked
die
in
his
sins
but
the
lord
would
hold
ezekiel
responsible
similarly
parents
are
responsible
to
teach
their
children
right
from
wrong
i
suspect
most
christians
and
jews
etc
would
agree
that
parents
have
this
responsibility
