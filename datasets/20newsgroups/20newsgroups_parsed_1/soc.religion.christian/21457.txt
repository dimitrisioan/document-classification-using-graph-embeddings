dreams
and
out
of
body
incidents
hey
folks
im
fairly
new
to
these
groups
tho
some
have
heard
from
me
before
id
like
to
get
your
comments
on
a
question
that
has
been
on
my
mind
a
lot
what
moralsethics
apply
to
dreams
and
outofbody
incidents
in
normal
dreams
you
cant
control
anything
so
obviously
you
arent
morally
responsible
for
your
actions
but
if
you
can
contrive
to
control
the
action
in
dreams
or
do
an
oobe
it
seems
like
a
morality
applies
now
there
seem
to
be
alternatives
dreams
and
oobes
are
totally
mental
phenomena
in
this
case
no
morality
applies
beyond
what
might
be
called
mental
hygiene
that
is
not
trying
to
think
about
anything
evil
or
indulgining
in
overly
sexy
or
violent
thoughts
dreams
and
oobes
have
a
reality
of
their
own
ie
are
another
plane
evidence
for
this
is
that
often
dreams
and
oobes
are
sometimes
done
in
common
by
more
than
one
person
a
mark
of
objective
fact
is
that
people
report
the
same
objective
experience
in
this
case
the
same
interpersonal
moralityethics
applies
in
dreams
and
oobes
as
does
in
waking
life
like
but
here
we
assume
that
though
the
dreeam
and
oobe
environs
have
a
real
existence
a
different
moralethics
apply
there
and
no
or
maybe
different
moral
laws
apply
there
so
there
it
is
is
one
of
these
cases
the
truth
or
does
anyone
know
of
another
alternative
respond
by
post
or
email
thanks
very
much
dt
