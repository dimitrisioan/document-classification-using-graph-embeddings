my
feeling
on
baptism
is
this
parents
baptize
their
baby

that
the
baby

sanctifying
grace
of
baptism
and
thus
removal
of
original
sin

its
soul

being
born
of
water
and
spirit

really
what
he
said
and
he
meant
it
that
verse
is
the
definition
of
baptism
i
dont
have
the
law
book
in

canon
law
that
urges
parents
to
baptize
their
children
within
one
week
of
birth
for
the
very
reason
that
