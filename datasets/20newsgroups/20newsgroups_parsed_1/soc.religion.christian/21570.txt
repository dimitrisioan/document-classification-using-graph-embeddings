mormon
beliefs
about
children
born
out

wedlock
bruce
webster
writes
indeed
lds
doctrine
goes
one
step
further
and
in
some
cases
holds
parents
responsible
for
their
childrens
sins
if
they
have
failed
to
bring
them
up
properly
cf
dc
note
that
this
passage
applies
it
only
to
members
of
the
lds
church
hi
bruce
how
do
you
reconcile
this
practice
with
ezekiel
ezekiel
the
soul
who
sins
is
the
one
who
will
die
the
son
will
not
share
the
guilt
of
the
father
nor
will
the
father
share
the
guilt
of
the
son
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
man
will
be
credited
to
him
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
will
be
charged
against
him
is
ezekiel
not
translated
correctly
in
your
eyes
perhaps
sincerely
aaron
cardenas
ps
i
too
am
bothered
to
see
offensive
words
being
posted
on
this
newsgroup
obscenity
is
out
of
place
for
anyone
who
wants
to
live
by
the
bible
eph

i
would
appreciate
your
not
letting
posts
with
foul
language
through
which
has
happened
at
least
twice
lately
thank
you
i
try
to
avoid
foul
language
bastard
is
certainly
foul
language
when
shouted
at
someone
as
an
insult
but
in
this
case
it
was
being
used
in
its
original
technical
sense
similarly
hell
is
an
obscenity
in
some
contexts
but
not
when
referring
to
the
afterlife
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
bastard
is
foul
language
when
its
being
used
in
its
proper
meaning
one
of
todays
postings
quotes
deut
am
i
to
