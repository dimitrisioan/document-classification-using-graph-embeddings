it
is
also
noteworthy

over
any
of
the
ot

john
and
explained
to
his
followers
on
the
road
to
emmaus
that
in
the

prophets
and
psalms
which
referred
to
him
the
ot
division
of
scripture
luke
as
well
as
in
luke
taking
genesis
to
chronicles
the
jewish
order
we
would
say
genesis
to
malachi
as
scripture
you
should
remember
that
in
adams
transgression
all
men
and
women
sinned
as
paul
wrote
all
of
humanity
cooperativley

is
transmitted
from
generation
