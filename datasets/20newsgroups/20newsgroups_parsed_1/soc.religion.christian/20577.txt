you
write
regarding
david
wilkersons
prophecies
while
im
not
real
sure
of
his
credibility
i
do
remember
a
book
he
wrote
called
a
vision
or
something
like
that
he
made
a
prediction
that
people
who
bought
gold
would
be
hurt
financially
at
the
time
gold
was
up
to
about
now
it
is
less
than
half
that
this
prediction
stuck
in
my
mind
because
a
lot
of
people
where
i
worked
were
buying
gold
note
that
the
above
type
of
prediction
does
not
require
a
god
to
be
made
an
expert
in
a
field
can
also
predict
things
based
on
experience
beware
of
predictions
like
the
volcano
will
erupt
tomorrow
dont
follow
the
preacher
because
of
such
statements
that
come
true
note
also
that
if
im
describing
a
hypothetical
death
of
a
friend
as
a
result
of
his
passion
for
fast
motorcycles
i
might
say
his
mother
predicted
he
would
die
of
course
his
father
may
have
said
he
ll
make
good
money
because
of
his
hobby
and
depending
upon
the
final
outcome
of
the
situation
i
end
up
mentioning
the
one
thats
relevant
a
reader
down
the
road
will
get
the
impression
that
the
mother
or
father
had
predicted
accurately
the
event
when
it
was
just
a
casual
statement
finally
on
prophesies
note
that
there
are
many
prophesies
that
can
be
fulfilled
my
people
often
to
fool
believers
if
i
say
beware
the
terminal
will
unexpectedly
be
shut
off
and
then
after
secs
i
turn
it
off
or
have
someone
come
out
from
another
room
and
do
it
there
was
no
prediction
a
similar
situation
arises
with
the
establishment
of
the
jewish
state
while
pressing
for
it
prominent
jews
argued
that
it
was
predicted
that
theyd
have
a
state
again
and
that
the
time
has
come
ive
read
this
somewhere
but
cant
think
of
the
source
if
you
can
please
let
me
know
in
this
case
the
establishment
of
the
state
does
not
really
fulfill
the
prophesy
since
the
prophesy
was
used
in
order
to
push
for
the
establishment
of
the
state
deciding
what
was
truely
a
fulfillment
of
prophesy
is
very
tricky
leo
my
mother
wanted
to
save
herself
until
marriage
every
leonidas
hepis
day
i
thank
god
that
she
didnt
because
without
pre
marital
sex
i
would
never
have
been
born
premarital
sex
what
a
beautiful
choice
