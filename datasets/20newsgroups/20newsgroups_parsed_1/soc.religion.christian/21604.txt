subject
re
mormons
and
eternal
marriage
was
re
mormon
temples
david
hammerslag
asked
how
do
you
mormons
reconcile
the
idea
of
eternal
marriage
with
christs
statement
that
in
the
resurrection
people
will
neither
marry
nor
be
given
in
marriage
luke
chapt
several
explanations
for
this
seeming
contradiction
have
been
proposed
but
most
lds
scholars
whose
opinions
i
have
studied
take
more
or
less
one
of
the
following
three
positions
jesus
was
talking
to
a
group
of
people
sadducees
who
were
trying
to
trip
him
up
with
what
they
felt
was
a
silly
hypothetical
situa
tion
that
ridiculed
the
concept
of
a
resurrection
something
they
didnt
believe
in
these
people
and
those
associated
with
them
now
there
were
with
us
seven
brethren
matt
would
not
be
receptive
to
such
higher
blessings
as
eternal
marriage
hence
the
people
in
the
story
would
likely
not
be
married
in
the
eterni
ties
but
that
doesnt
mean
other
more
faithful
people
could
not
have
this
blessing
jesus
was
making
a
distinction
between
the
state
or
condition
of
being
married
and
the
process
of
becoming
married
the
latter
activity
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
will
not
take
place
in
the
eternities
because
all
eternal
marriages
will
be
taken
care
of
before
then
the
account
as
we
have
it
in
all
three
of
the
synoptic
gospels
is
missing
something
that
would
make
its
real
meaning
clearer
note
that
we
lds
do
not
believe
in
biblical
inerrancy
so
we
do
not
in
general
feel
obliged
to
reconcile
each
and
every
bible
text
with
modern
revelation
through
joseph
smith
and
other
latterday
proph
ets
nor
are
we
particularly
upset
that
the
account
in
question
was
not
significantly
revised
in
the
joseph
smith
translation
or
inspired
version
of
the
bible
since
we
do
not
believe
this
work
was
completed
or
that
failure
to
revise
a
passage
in
the
jst
con
stitutes
divine
approval
of
that
passage

it
stands
