authority
chris
mussack
writes
for
all
those
people
who
insist
i
question
authority
why
how
about
the
holocaust
the
spanish
inquisition
jonestown
just
to
name
a
few
authorities
sometimes
tell
people
to
do
evil
things
people
who
just
follow
orders
have
tortured
and
killed
others
in
very
large
numbers
and
protest
their
innocence
afterwards
when
your
authority
starts
telling
you
to
do
things
you
should
ask
questions
except
for
situations
of
pressing
need

hatch
because
the
submarine
is
filling
with
water
any
reasonable
authority
should
be
able
to
give
at
least
some
justification
that
you
can
understand
just
be
sure
to
listen
when
authority
answers
if
anybody
is
interested
in
questions
of
psychological
pressure
and
following
orders
you
might
want
to
read
about
a
study
done
by
solomon
ashe
in
on
conformity
and
another
done
by
stanley
milgram
in
on
obedience
both
should
be
in
any
good
book
on
psychologysociology
the
results
are
both
fascinating
and
terrifying
