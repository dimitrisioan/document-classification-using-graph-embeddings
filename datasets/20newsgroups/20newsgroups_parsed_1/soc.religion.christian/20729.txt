re
atheists
and
hell
we
look
for
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
life
of
the
world
to
come
niceneconstantinopolitan
creed
i
always
took
the
resurrection
in
this
statement
to
mean
the
resurrection
of
the
soul
but
i
guess
resurrection
does
strictly
mean
the
raising
of
the
physical
body
i
have
some
questions
on
this
point
the
next
time
you
go
to
church
you
can
check
the
better
creed
that
is
the
apostles
creed
it
says
the
resurrection
of
the
body
should
have
learned
that
on
the
first
go
around
but
whats
a
body
without
a
little
bit
asoul
i
always
thought
that
christians
believe
the
descent
into
hell
was
pretty
much
immediate
and
that
there
are
people
burning
in
hell
right
now
where
will
my
soul
which
by
the
way
i
dont
believe
in
exist
until
that
time
at
the
risk
of
offending
everybody
i
will
interject
the
th
century
point
of
view
christ
descended
immediately
into
the
bosom
of
abraham
to
set
captives
captive
he
preached
to
the
saved
for
three
days
before
drawing
them
with
him
back
to
this
earth
im
no
expert
on
this
part
but
matthew
says
about
the
death
of
jesus
tombs
were
opened
and
the
bodies
of
many
saints
who
had
fallen
asleep
were
raised
and
coming
forth
from
the
tombs
after
his
resurrection
they
entered
the
holy
city
and
appeared
to
many
nab
regarding
the
hell
of
the
damned
of
which
you
speak
christ
did
not
see
it
ps
acts
although
it
saw
him
cf
is
concerning
the
abodes
of
the
dead
i
dont
want
to
subject
my
brethren
to
further
anguish
so
i
will
direct
you
to
contact
me
through
email
if
you
are
genuinely
concerned
will
the
new
body
i
will
have
be
created
out
of
the
same
atoms
that
my
body
now
is
made
of
or
will
it
be
built
from
scratch
your
new
body
might
be
something
like
adams
before
his
fateful
encounter
with
the
just
one
acts
cr
trans
vulgate
filled
with
infused
knowledge
absent
of
concupiscence
and
immortal
it
would
probably
be
a
little
glorified
too
since
i
will
have
a
physical
body
i
assume
it
will
need
a
physical
place
to
exist
in
where
is
this
hell
in
the
center
of
the
earth
do
you
think
we
could
find
it
if
we
dig
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
its
really
hot
down
at
the
center
of
the
earth
you
know
the
normal
geothermal
gradient
and
all
that
regards
boundary
the
catechist
no
teneis
que
pensar
que
yo
haya
venido
a
traer
la
paz
a
la
tierra
no
he
venido
a
traer
la
paz
sino
la
guerra
mateo
