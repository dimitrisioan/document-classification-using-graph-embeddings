i
have
a
question
for
bob
why
in
the
world
would
any
selfrespecting
atheist
want
to
subscribe
to
a
christian
news
group
i
have
a
difficult
enough
time
keeping
up
with
it
and
i
think
i
know
something
about
the
subject
excuse
me
but
what
makes
you
think
that
just
because
hes
atheist
he
doesnt
know
anything
about
christianity
in
my
albeit
limited
experience
atheists
are
often
the
ones
who
know
more
about
the
bible
having
searched
it
from
end
to
end
for
answers
i
myself
am
a
christian
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
consider
myself
more
of
an
authority
on
my
religion
i
just
have
a
different
perspective
on
it
more
biased
in
favor
naturally
it
seems
quite
obvious
why
he
is
subscribed
if
i
may
infer
from
what
he
says
he
is
looking
for
an
explanation
who
are
we
to
question
his
motives
anyway
at
the
very
least
although
i
dislike
this
kind
of
logic
one
could
hope
that
he
will
see
the
light
critcism
will
i
fear
not
give
him
a
very
positive
picture
of
christians
bob
reminds
me
of
my
roommate
in
order
to
disbelieve
atheism
he
says
he
will
need
to
be
proven
wrong
about
it
well
i
dont
even
waste
my
time
trying
i
tell
him
that
hell
just
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
in
response
he
tells
me
he
will
say
an
atheists
prayer
for
me
with
regard
to
this
i
guess
i
dont
really
feel
sentiments
of
this
order
can
be
proven
faith
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
this
is
why
those
who
search
the
bible
from
cover
to
cover
for
answers
wont
necessarily
get
what
theyre
looking
for
of
course
that
doesnt
help
anyone
who
doesnt
already
have
faith
what
a
big
catch
i
discovered
this
quite
recently
when
i
ran
into
an
agnostic
looking
for
an
explanation
of
my
faith
and
i
quickly
discovered
that
i
could
give
him
nothing
more
than
my
life
story
and
a
description
of
my
nature
faith
is
a
very
personal
thing
any
attempt
to
prove
the
facts
behind
it
must
be
questioned
good
luck
bob
and
best
regards
likewise
no
matter

you
