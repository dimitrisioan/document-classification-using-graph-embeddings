i
think
youre
talking
about
the
assumption
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
it
says
that
the
immaculate
mother
of
god
the
ever
virgin
mary
having
completed
the
course
of
her
earthly
life
was
assumed
body
and
soul
into
heavenly
glory
this
was
defined
by
a
papal
statement
in
though
it
had
certainly
been
believed
by
some
before
that
like
the
immaculate
conception
this
is
primarily
a
roman
catholic
doctrine
and
like
it
it
has
no
direct
biblical
support
note
that
catholics
do
not
believe
in
sola
scriptura
that
is
they
do
not
believe
that
the
bible
is
the
only
source
of
christian
knowledge
thus
the
fact
that
a
doctrine
has
little
biblical
support
is
not
necessarily
significant
to
them
they
believe
that
truth
can
be
passed
on
through
traditions
of
the
church
and
also
that
it
can
be
revealed
to
the
church
im
not
interested
in
yet
another
catholicprotestant
argument
but
if
any
catholics
can
tell
us
the
basis
for
these
beliefs
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
clh
that
is
generally
accuate
but
contains
one
serious
error
we
catholics
do
believe
that
gods
revealed
truth
that
is
not
explicitly
recorded
in
the
bible
can
be
and
is
passed
on
through
the
tradition
of
the
church
it
should
be
noted
that
the
tradition
of
the
church
otherwise
known
as
sacred
tradition
is
not
the
same
as
ordinary
human
traditions
however
we
do
not
believe
that
additional
truth
will
be
revealed
to
the
church
public
revelation
which
is
the
basis
of
catholic
doctrine
ended
with
the
death
of
st
john
the
last
apostle
nothing
new
can
be
added
theologians
study
this
revelation
and
can
draw
out
implications
that
were
not
recognized
previously
so
that
the
council
of
nicea
could
define
statements
about
the
theology
of
the
trinity
and
the
incarnation
that
were
not
explicitly
stated
in
the
bible
and
had
been
disputed
before
the
council
but
there
was
no
new
revelation
at
nicea
or
at
any
subsequent
council

essay

the
development

he
was

is
an
