atheists
and
hell

writes
atheists
believe
that
when
they
die
they
die
forever
a
god
who
would
condemn
those
who
fail
to
believe
in
him
to
eternal
death
is
unfair
i
dont
see
what
the
problem
is
to
christians
hell
is
by
definition
eternal
deathexactly
what
atheists
are
expecting
when
they
die
well
i
think
that
most
christians
believe
that
your
conciousness
will
somehow
continue
on
after
your
physical
death
which
contradicts
what
most
atheists
myself
included
believe
namely
that
your
conciousness
being
contained
in
your
brain
dies
when
your
brain
dies
theres
no
reason
hell
has
to
be
especially
awfulto
most
people
eternal
death
is
bad
enough
i
fear
the
pain
that
often
comes
with
the
process
of
dying
but
since
i
wont
be
around
to
worry
about
it
i
dont
fear
eternal
death
literal
interpreters
of
the
bible
will
have
a
problem
with
this
view
since
the
bible
talks
about
the
fires
of
hell
and
such
this
is
something
ive
always
found
confusing
if
all
your
nerve
endings
die
with
your
physical
body
why
would
flame
hurt
you
how
can
one
wail
and
gnash
teeth
with
no
lungs
and
no
teeth
