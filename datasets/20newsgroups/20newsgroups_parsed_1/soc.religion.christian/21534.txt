eternal
marriage
was
mormon
temples
in
article
david
hammerslag
writes
this
paragraph
brought
to
mind
a
question
how
do
you
mormons
reconcile
the
idea
of
eternal
marriage
with
christs
statement
that
in
the
ressurection
people
will
neither
marry
nor
be
given
in
marriage
luke
chapt
well
here
is
something
i
wrote
some
time
ago
in
response
to
a
similar
question
i
hope
it
helps
begin
repeat
of
previous
post
as
for
the
scripture
mentioned
i
agree
that
it
does
seem
to
be
a
problem
not
only
for
eternal
marriage
but
marriage
in
general
lukes
version
has
jesus
saying
that
the
children
of
this
world
marry
and
are
given
in
marriage
but
not
those
who
will
attain
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
almost
sounds
like
marriage
disqualifies
one
for
salvation
matthew
and
mark
both
omit
this
statement
i
think
the
accounts
are
not
as
clear
as
they
might
be
lets
have
a
look
at
the
incident
and
see
if
we
can
come
up
with
some
reasonable
ideas
of
what
it
means
the
scriptures
involved
are
mat
mark
and
luke
what
happened
was
that
the
sadducees
who
did
not
believe
in
the
resurrection
thought
they
could
trap
jesus
they
made
reference
to
the
leverite
marriage
which
required
the
brother
of
a
man
who
died
without
children
to
take
the
widow
to
wife
and
raise
up
children
the
children
would
be
considered
children
of
the
deceased
just
as
though
the
womans
first
husband
had
fathered
them
it
seems
obvious
from
this
that
the
woman
was
still
considered
in
a
way
to
be
the
wife
of
her
first
husband
however
the
sadducees
concocted
a
scene
in
which
brothers
of
the
deceased
each
in
his
turn
failed
to
father
children
by
the
widow
they
seem
to
imply
that
the
leverite
marriage
was
equal
to
the
first
for
they
ask
whose
wife
shall
she
be
in
the
resurrection
at
this
point
it
seems
obvious
that
if
she
is
anybodys
wife
it
is
the
first
husband
after
all
had
she
borne
children
they
would
have
been
credited
to
him
regardless
of
which
brother
was
the
biological
father
it
is
possible
jesus
was
refering
to
this
when
he
says
ye
do
err
not
knowing
the
scriptures
or
the
power
of
god
mat
compare
mark
phrase
not
in
lukes
account
anyway
the
sadducees
ask
whose
wife
will
she
be
in
the
resurrection
seeing
that
all
had
her
jesus
answer
is
that
in
the
resurrection
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
mat
when
they
rise
from
the
dead
they
neither
marry
mark
they
which
are
accounted
worthy
to
obtain
that
world
neither
marry
luke
all
accounts
go
on
to
say
but
are
as
the
angels
in
heaven
or
the
equivalent
i
find
this
last
not
very
helpful
since
the
bible
does
not
define
angels
nor
give
any
idea
what
their
life
is
like
some
ministers
claim
that
they
are
sexless
different
that
humans
etc
but
i
can
find
no
biblical
support
for
this
i
think
what
jesus
is
saying
here
and
it
is
clearest
in
matthews
and
marks
accounts
is
that
marriages
will
not
be
performed
in
the
resurrection
this
goes
along
with
our
belief
that
if
a
person
is
to
marry
at
all
it
must
be
done
on
this
earth
however
we
do
believe
that
a
marriage
performed
by
the
authority
of
god
can
be
binding
in
eternity
in
fact
the
first
marriage
appears
to
have
been
performed
by
god
himself
before
death
entered
the
world
in
the
garden
of
eden
what
therefore
god
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
asunder
mat
jesus
also
told
peter
and
the
other
apostles
that
whatsoever
they
should
bind
on
earth
should
be
bound
in
heaven
mat
i
believe
that
this
also
refers
to
marriages
performed
by
the
proper
authority
