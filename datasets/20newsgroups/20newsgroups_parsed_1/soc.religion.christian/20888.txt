re
the
arrogance
of
christians
if
i
dont
think
my
belief
is
right
and
everyone
elses
belief
is
wrong
then
i
dont
have
a
belief
this
is
simply
what
belief
means
unfortunatly
this
seems
to
be
how
christians
are
taught
to
think
when
it
comes
to
their
religion
some
take
it
to
the
extreme
and
say
that
their
religion
is
the
only
one
and
if
you
dont
accept
their
teachings
then
you
wont
be
saved
it
takes
quite
a
bit
of
arrogance
to
claim
to
know
what
god
thinkswants
especially
when
its
based
upon
your
interpretation
of
a
book
the
logic
in
the
above
statement
is
faulty
in
that
it
assumes
two
people
with
differing
beliefs
cant
both
be
correct
its
all
about
perception
no
two
people
are
exactly
alike
no
two
people
perceive
everything
in
the
same
way
i
believe
that
there
is
one
truth
call
it
gods
truth
a
universal
truth
or
call
it
what
you
will
i
dont
believe
god
presents
this
truth
i
think
it
is
just
there
and
its
up
to
you
to
look
for
and
see
it
through
prayer
meditation
inspir
ation
dreams
or
whatever
just
because
people
may
perceive
this
truth
differently
it
doesnt
mean
one
is
wrong
and
the
other
is
right
as
an
example
take
the
question
is
the
glass
half
empty
or
half
full
you
can
have
two
different
answers
which
are
contradictory
and
yet
both
are
correct
so
for
your
belief
to
be
true
does
not
require
everyone
elses
belief
to
be
wrong
if
a
person
has
what
they
believe
is
convincing
evidence
that
god
will
save
only
christians
its
hard
to
see
how
you
can
criticize
them
for
arrogance
for
saying
so
it
could
be
that
theyre
wrong
but
i
hardly
see
that
its
arrogance
lets
look
at
this
a
bit
closer
suppose
we
had
some
combination
of
prophets
and
messiahs
that
taught
us
things
but
didnt
say
anything
about
exclusivity
if
we
believe
them
and
then
add
and
anybody
who
believes
anything
else
is
damned
then
you
could
well
criticize
us
for
arrogance
but
in
this
case
the
exclusivity
is
in
the
message
as
it
comes
from
the
prophets
etc
so
we
could
be
wrong
in
believing
it
but
i
dont
see
how
we
can
be
called
arrogant
maybe
the
world
isnt
a
soft
place
maybe
certain
choices
actually
do
have
eternal
consequences
i
can
see
calling
the
christian
message
arrogant
in
a
certain
sense
though
only
in
the
same
sense
as
calling
the
law
of
gravitation
arrogant
because
it
doesnt
give
us
any
option
over
whether
we
fall
if
we
jump
off
a
building
but
not
christians
for
passing
it
on
given
that
they
believe
it
the
complaints
i
can
see
making
are
that
christians
are
wrong
or
that
god
is
arrogant
