methods
that
teach
contraceptive
technology
and
advise
kids
how
to
make
choices
actually
increase
pregnancy
rates
i
posted
a
long
article
on
this
a
while
back
and
will
be
happy
to
email
a
copy
to
any
who
are
interested
the
same
research
produced
the
results
that
abstinencerelated
curricula
were
found
to
decrease
pregnancy
rates
in
teens
i
assume
that
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
aids
rate
will
fluctuate
with
the
pregnancy
rate
id
be
fascinated
to
see
such
evidence
please
send
me
your
article
on
the
negative
side
however
i
suspect
that
any
such
simplistic
link
abstinenceeducation
decreased
pregnancy
contraceptiveeducation
increased
pregnancy
is
false
the
us
which
id
guess
has
one
of
the
largest
proportion
of
nonliberal
sex
education
in
the
western
world
also
has
one
of
the
highest
teenage
pregnancy
rates
please
correct
me
if
my
guess
is
wrong
