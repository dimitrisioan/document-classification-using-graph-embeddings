i
would
like
to
see
christians
devote
a
bit
less
effort
to
bashing
paganism
and
more
to
figuring
out
how
to
present
the
gospel
to
pagans
christ
is
the
answer
the
pagans
have
a
lot
of
the
right
questions
unlike
materialists
who
deny
the
need
for
any
spirituality
one
of
the
things
i
find
intersting
about
pagan
beliefs
is
their
belief
in
a
feminine
deity
as
well
as
a
masculine
deity
being
brought
up
in
a
christian
household
i
often
wondered
if
there
was
god
the
father
where
was
the
mother
everyone
i
know
who
has
a
father
usually
as
a
mother
it
just
seemed
rather
unbalanced
to
me
fortunately
my
own
personal
theology
which
will
probably
not
fall
into
line
with
a
lot
others
recognized
god
as
a
being
both
without
gender
and
posessing
qualities
of
both
genders
as
being
both
a
masculine
and
feminine
force
it
provides
a
sense
of
balance
i
find
sorely
lacking
in
most
theologies
a
lack
which
i
think
is
responsible
for
a
lot
of
the
unbalanced
ways
in
which
we
see
the
world
and
treat
each
other
terrance
heath
your
comfort
is
my
silence
