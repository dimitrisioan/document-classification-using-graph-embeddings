of
christianity
although
simplistic
i
have
always
liked
the
fact
that
a
christian
is
one
who
not
only
believes
in
god
but
believes
god
after
all
the
name
was
first
given
externally
to
identify
those
who
preached
christ
and
him
crucified
to
pay
the
price
of
their
rebeliion
and
shortcomings
before
god
god
said
this
was
his
son

its
certainly
a
good
things
for
christians
to
follow
but
as
a
definition
it
may
be
a
bit
hard
to
apply
