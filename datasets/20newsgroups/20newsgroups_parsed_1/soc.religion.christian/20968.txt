i
am
asking
you
to
believe
in
things
not
visible
i
dont
know
if
this
is
believeing
blindly
or
not
if
you
decide
in
advance
that
your
reason
will
act
only
on
the
evidence
of
the
five
physical
senses
then
you
cut
reason
off
from
any
possibility
of
reaching
a
conclusion
outside
the
physical
sphere
someone
said
thinking
if
i
could
see
i
would
believe
then
someone
said
believe
and
you
will
see
