the
arrogance
of
christians
writes
arrogance
is
arrogance
it
is
not
the
result
of
religion
it
is
the
result
of
people
knowing
or
firmly
believing
in
an
idea
and
ones
desire
to
show
others
of
ones
rightness
i
assume
that
god
decided
to
be
judge
for
our
sake
as
much
as
his
own
if
we
allow
him
who
is
kind
and
merciful
be
the
judge
well
probably
be
better
off
than
if
others
judged
us
or
we
judged
ourselves
im
not
sure
i
agree
with
this
i
agree
that
arrogance
is
not
the
result
of
religion
and
that
god
is
a
far
better
judge
than
we
are
i
also
agree
if
you
mean
to
say
that
arrogance
shows
up
in
the
form
of
trying
to
prove
ones
superior
knowledge
rightness
or
holiness
over
another
persons
beliefs
i
need
to
be
careful
to
understand
what
you
mean
here
so
that
i
do
not
fall
into
the
mistake
of
misrepresenting
your
views
if
i
fall
down
in
this
area
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
arrogance
is
not
the
result
of
believing
one
is
right
or
of
believing
that
ones
god
is
greater
than
the
gods
of
others
or
of
believing
that
ones
religion
is
better
than
other
religions
these
are
all
naturally
selfimplied
beliefs
it
is
selfcontradictory
to
say
that
i
believe
my
current
beliefs
to
be
wrong
were
i
to
find
myself
in
error
my
beliefs
would
naturally
change
and
follow
what
i
believe
to
be
right
therefore
i
must
always
consider
my
beliefs
correct
thats
not
arrogance
thats
unavoidable
behavior
it
is
nonsense
to
say
that
i
believe
another
persons
god
to
be
greater
than
my
god
were
his
or
her
god
greater
wouldnt
i
be
obligated
to
change
so
that
their
god
would
become
my
god
we
are
naturally
obligated
to
worship
that
god
which
we
deem
to
be
the
greatest
why
should
we
feel
obligated
to
worship
a
second
best
god
for
the
sake
of
feeling
humble
arrogance
is
not
necessarily
thinking
onesself
to
be
better
looking
or
more
intelligent
or
stronger
or
having
more
resources
than
another
person
no
doubt
many
will
have
to
chew
on
this
one
awhile
were
passive
observation
of
ones
superior
points
arrogance
then
god
would
be
most
arrogant
of
all
humility
does
not
rest
in
slandering
or
belittling
gods
work
of
creation
in
our
lives
people
often
go
around
trying
to
be
humble
saying
to
one
another
im
not
very
smart
im
poor
im
not
good
looking
im
just
a
worm
in
the
ground
im
such
a
weak
person
and
although
i
dont
want
to
sin
i
really
can
not
help
it
were
this
person
truely
humble
he
would
take
a
different
approach
god
thank
you
for
making
me
the
way
you
did
i
know
that
you
never
do
anything
second
best
yet
with
all
that
you
have
given
me
i
have
been
so
unthankful
youve
given
me
power
to
resist
the
devil
i
have
not
used
it
but
have
indulged
myself
in
doing
exactly
what
you
have
said
not
to
do
i
have
slandered
your
creation
in
my
life
and
have
credited
myself
with
humility
for
doing
so
lord
with
all
youve
given
me
i
have
been
completely
unfaithful
and
i
do
not
deserve
your
forgiveness
and
yet
your
love
for
me
is
so
boundless
that
you
would
give
yourself
to
die
for
me
to
save
me
as
terribly
evil
as
i
am
i
deserve
to
go
straight
to
hell
yet
it
pleases
you
somehow
to
rescue
me
from
this
terrible
life
ive
led
lord
please
forgive
me
and
help
me
stay
on
the
right
track
so
that
i
can
bring
glory
to
your
name
instead
of
insult
lord
im
so
sorry
for
my
wrongs
please
help
me
to
change
i
think
people
take
exceptional
offense
to
religious
arrogance
because
they
dont
want
to
be
wrong
if
i
find
someone
arrogant
i
typically
dont
have
anything
to
do
with
them
for
me
ive
often
found
it
hard
to
tell
the
difference
often
times
the
most
humble
christian
has
come
across
to
me
as
arrogant
while
the
most
proud
worm
in
the
ground
false
humility
type
person
has
been
found
to
be
most
comfortable
company
when
im
wrong
and
arrogant
about
my
wrongness
i
certainly
dont
feel
like
being
confronted
by
my
wrongness
were
someone
to
confront
me
verbally
with
my
wrongness
id
be
likely
to
snap
at
them
and
examine
them
head
to
toe
for
all
their
faults
and
charge
them
with
hypocricy
for
what
they
said
to
me
at
the
root
my
desire
would
be
to
make
them
shut
up
so
that
i
can
go
about
living
my
life
arrogantly
as
i
wish
however
were
someone
to
confront
me
silently
by
their
example
earn
my
respect
and
perhaps
mention
it
to
me
in
humility
in
private
id
feel
broken
down
and
challenged
to
seek
god
for
help
in
changing
from
the
error
of
my
ways
the
hard
part
is
getting
to
the
point
to
where
i
can
be
humble
before
anyone
regardless
of
their
humility
or
prideregardless
of
their
hypocricy
or
sincerityregardless
of
whether
onlookers
will
frown
down
upon
me
or
not
it
isnt
easy
to
take
this
pain
in
love
with
thankfulness
for
the
opportunity
to
improve
in
ones
ability
to
serve
god
its
easier
to
cast
aside
any
hope
of
reaching
true
humility
and
merely
hide
behind
slandering
gods
creation
in
our
lives
instead
but
we
should
examine
ourselves
i
hope
i
typed
this
back
in
right
and
why
we
react
to
certain
situations
with
such
emotions
for
instance
many
of
us
feel
justified
to
be
insulted
by
an
arrogant
person
as
if
we
needed
a
reason
to
feel
insulted
but
after
being
insulted
over
and
over
again
by
the
words
of
others
youd
think
wed
either
toughen
up
or
decide
not
to
be
insulted
or
ignore
the
insult
just
because
you
can
justify
feelings
of
anger
or
insult
or
outrage
that
doesnt
make
that
reaction
the
appropriate
one
it
is
in
this
light
of
selfexamination
that
we
can
change
our
emotional
reactions
sometimes
it
helps
when
we
can
understand
and
feel
the
difference
between
what
is
a
true
statement
of
our
character
and
what
is
a
false
and
slanderous
statement
of
our
character
the
devil
is
the
accuser
of
the
bretheren
he
would
love
us
to
feel
hopelessly
guilty
where
we
are
innocent
and
feel
arrogant
and
selfrighteous
where
we
are
indeed
wrong
the
devils
aim
is
to
get
us
into
as
much
misery
as
he
can
just
think
of
the
devil
as
a
cruel
and
merci
less
criminal
who
torments
a
parent
by
burning
his
or
her
children
with
hot
irons
the
way
the
devil
gets
under
the
fathers
skin
is
by
hurting
those
that
the
father
loves
so
much
i
deplore
the
horrible
crime
of
child
murder
we
want
prevention
not
merely
punishment
we
must
reach
the
root
of
the
evil
it
is
practiced
by
those
whose
inmost
souls
revolt
from
the
dreadful
deed
no
mater
what
the
motive
love
of
ease
or
a
desire
to
save
from
suffering
the
unborn
innocent
the
woman
is
awfully
guilty
who
commits
the
deed
but
oh
thrice
guilty
is
he
who
drove
her
to
the
desperation
which
impelled
her
to
the
crime
