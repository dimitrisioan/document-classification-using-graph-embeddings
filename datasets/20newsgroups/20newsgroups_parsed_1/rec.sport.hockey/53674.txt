writes
it
was
bryan
trottier
not
denis
potvin
it
was
a
vicious
boarding
from
behindtrottier
was
given
a
major
perhaps
it
was
trottier
it
happened
behind
the
habs
goal
if
i
recall
gainey
simply
didnt
have
his
head
up
as
he
was
picking
up
the
puck
but
roger
what
the
hell
does
this
have
to
do
with
gaineys
skill
as
a
hockey
player
if
probert
smashes
gilmours
head
into
the
boards
next
week
will
that
diminish
your
assessment
of
gilmours
skills
if
gilmour
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
as
gainey
was
then
yeah
i
would
have
to
say
that
doug
wasnt
playing
technically
smart
hockey
in
any
case
to
claim
as
greg
did
that
gainey
never
made
a
technical
mistake
is
absolutely
ludicrous
gainey
was
a
plugger
and
when
the
press
runs
out
of
things
to
say
about
the
stars
on
dynasties
they
start
to
hype
the
pluggers
grant

essa
tikkannen

bob

bob

doug
jarvis
derek
sanderson
wayne

bob

so
on
i
would
take
fuhr
and
sanderson
off
of
the
latter
good
for
you
youd
only
be
displaying
your
ignorance
of
course
but
to
each
his
own
i
think
gainey
would
be
honoured
to
know
that
youve
included
him
i
think
gainey
should
feel
honoured
to
know
that
he
is
remembered
at
all
on
this
list
i
also
think
you
have
a
relatively
naive
view
about
what
wins
a
hockey
gamepluggers
are
an
integral
part
of
certainly
pluggers
are
an
integral
part
of
any
team
and
that
is
simply
because
there
are
not
enough
solid
twoway
players
to
go
around
who
would
you
rather
have
as
your
checking
centre
doug
gilmour
or
doug
jarvis
for
that
matter
i
would
take
either
gretzky
or
mario
as
my
checking
centres
do
you
think
gretzky
could
cover
bob
gainey
any
team
the
selke
is
designed
to
acknowledge
their
contributioni
think
that
most
people
understand
that
its
not
the
nobel
prizeso
settle
down
youre
wrong
again
the
selke
is
awarded
to
the
forward
that
does
the
best
job
defensively
and
this
may
or
may
not
be
the
best
plugger
if
gilmour
does
the
best
defensive
job
in
the
league
i
dont
see
why
he
should
be
out
of
the
running
simply
because
he
also
contributes
offen
sively
settle
down
if
you
think
that
i
have
likened
the
selke
to
the
nobel
prize
then
i
suggest
that
you
had
best
settle
down
and
if
you
are
going
to
try
to
put
words
in
my
mouth
let
me
suggest
that
you
settle
down
before
you
bother
following
up
on
my
postings
congenially
as
always
jd
james
david
you
might
consider
developing
your
own
style
after
all
imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
flattery
is
not
your
intention
cordially
as
always
