subject
tv
coverage
nhl
to
blame
the
tv
coverage
of
the
playoffs
is
fucking
ridicules
overtime
time
games
that
are
not
shown
what
the
hell
kind
of
shit
is
this
if
that
would
have
happened
to
the
flyersif
they
were
in
the
damn
playoffs
to
begin
with
while
i
was
watching
i
would
have
gone
throught
the
roof
however
everybody
is
getting
pissed
off
at
espn
but
they
are
not
the
ones
to
blame
they
have
prior
contracts
that
they
just
cant
simply
break
whenever
they
want
to
the
nhl
is
to
blame
when
they
signed
the
deal
with
espn
they
had
to
know
of
this
they
had
to
know
shit
like
this
would
happen
since
they
wouldnt
have
complete
priority
the
nhl
should
be
feeling
the
heat
that
is
being
thrown
at
espn
how
can
the
nhl
do
this
to
its
fans
how
dare
they
we
are
the
ones
that
make
the
damn
league
exist
and
they
cant
even
televise
complete
playoff
games
for
us
to
watch
they
more
i
write
about
this
the
more
pissed
off
i
get
we
must
let
the
nhl
know
that
we
expect
a
little
better
than
this
if
anybody
out
there
knows
how
to
go
about
doing
this
let
me
and
everybody
else
know
well
i
had
to
get
that
off
my
chest
and
while
im
at
it
mario
is
the
michael
jordan
of
hockey
all
that
fucker
has
to
do
is
fall
on
the
ice
and
the
closet
guy
to
him
gets
at
least
last
night
in
the
rd
game
between
nj
and
pitt
he
was
being
pushed
while
skating
across
the
front
of
the
goal
while
trying
to
get
a
shot
off
the
guy
on
him
was
doing
a
good
job
so
he
got
off
a
weak
shot
but
then
he
decided
to
fall
to
the
ice
then
the
fucking
refvan
helloamend
called
the
guy
for
holding
they
replayed
the
play
and
my
roomatewho
is
clueless
about
hockey
wanted
to
know
what
the
nj
guy
did
to
get
a
call
because
it
was
so
fucking
obvious
the
nj
player
had
both
hands
on
his
stick
and
no
he
did
not
trip
him
it
is
simple
mario
gets
touched
he
falls
to
the
ice
automatic
but
the
thing
that
really
pissed
me
off
is
pitt
scored
the
rd
or
th
goal
i
dont
remember
on
the
resulting
pp
and
eventually
won
his
divingcalls
makes
a
huge
difference
in
the
outcome
of
a
game
they
got
ta
stop
the
damn
holding
and
interference
that
is
so
fucking
obvious
that
is
not
hockey
it
allows
inferior
players
to
bring
down
the
level
of
the
better
players
and
allows
inferior
teams
to
beat
better
ones
this
has
pissed
me
off
for
many
years
now
and
it
has
improved
somewhat
however
during
the
playoffs
and
rd
periods
the
damn
refs
must
misplace
their
balls
because
they
sure
dont
make
any
calls
that
show
that
they
got
any
all
agreeing
or
disagreeing
replies
are
welcomed
