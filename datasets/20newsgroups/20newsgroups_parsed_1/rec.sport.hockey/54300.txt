just
wondering
where
all
the
bruins
fans
are
i
mean
they
woofed
it
up
with
about
posts
during
the
regular
season
saying
that
their
fave
team
was
going
to
kick
everyones
in
the
playoffs
and
win
the
stanley
cup
while
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
a
little
ranting
and
raving
im
just
curious
why
all
the
boston
faithful
have
stopped
posting
i
mean
i
havent
even
see
just
one
little
boston
fan
post
cept
for
the
bruins
fans
that
arent
cocky

maybe
theyre
all
out
on
the
golf
course
or

dont
know

sure
like
to
see
where
all
those
bruins
fans
are
at
still
here
just
doing
a
little
sobbing
in
our
beer
