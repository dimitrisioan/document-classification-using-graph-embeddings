murray
wasnt
responsible
for
primeau
although
im
not
ready
to
admit
thats
a
horrible
pick
they
hired
him
after
the
draft
which
has
never
made
sense
to
me
his
first
pick
was
lapointe
i
dont
think
primeau
is
necessarily
a
bad
pickim
was
just
trying
to
locate
the
beginning
of
murrays
decisionshe
slowness
in
trading
carson
has
delayed
primeaus
developmentand
you
have
to
wait
longer
for
big
players
oftenand
primeau
can
be
a
very
good
player
without
being
a
pointagameplayer
especially
on
a
team
that
has
yzerman
and
fedorovif
primeau
becomes
joel
otto
and
gets
goals
a
season
and
plays

will
have
been
an

good
pick
