if
the
penguins
get
out
of
the
patrick
they
will
win
the
cup
however
their
hardest
task
is
to
get
out
of
that
division
im
sure
that
washington
will
most
definitly
throw
a
rench
into
the
penguin
plans
im
a
canucks
fan
not
that
i
think
much
of
their
chances
this
year
but
it
seems
to
me
like
washington
is
the
only
team
that
can
stop
the
penguins
from
winning
their
next
stanley
cup
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
penguins
has
had
the
caps
number
for
most
of
the
season

last
