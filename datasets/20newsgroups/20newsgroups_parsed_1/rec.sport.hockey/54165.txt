rumour
keenan
signs
with
rangers

writes
interestingly
keenans
cocoach
or
is
it
his
number
one
on
team
canada
at
the
world
championships
is
roger
neilsen
but
ultimately
their
hockey
philosophies
are
like
night
and
day
keenan
believes
in
pressuring
the
opposition
and
taking
the
initiative
within
the
limits
of
his
systemwhile
roger
has
a
reactive
hockey
philosophywhich
is
why
messier
will
be
able
to
and
has
played
for
keenan
but
thought
rogers
way
was
a
sure
loser
itd
be
interesting
if
the
rangers
call
in
the
balance
of
neilsens
contract
to
be
keenans
assistant
roger
did
do
a
very
good
job
with
the
mediocre
players
just
as
he
handled
the
cinderella
canucks
of
years
ago
but
his
mistake
was
playing
the
rangers
like
those
canucks
last
may
roger
is
a
great
assistant
coachbut
considering
what
must
be
bad
blood
between
nielson
and
messier
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
bring
him
back
even
in
that
role
gerald
