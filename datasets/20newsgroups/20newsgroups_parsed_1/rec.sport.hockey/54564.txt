im
a
hockey
fan
from
way
back
and
maintain
an
interest
as
best
i
can
here
in
the
hockey
hinterlands
oklahoma
im
hoping
i
can
get
a
reading
from
some
of
you
about
the
move
of
the
north
stars
to
dallas
ive
been
under
the
impression
that
minnesota
was
one
of
or
possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
opinions
please
well
as
a
hockey
fan
i
think
its
terrible
its
one
thing
to
say
hey
lets
give
a
hockey
team
to
cities
that
dont
have
one
thats
fine
its
entirely
another
to
say
okay
lets
take
a
team
from
a
thriving
hockey
town
and
move
it
of
course
none
of
us
will
ever
know
the
real
inside
story
but
from
what
i
know
a
group
of
minneapolis
businessmen
told
green
repeatedly
that
they
would
purchase
the
remaining
season
tickets
to
get
to
the
level
that
green
wanted
yet
he
refused
every
time
its
pretty
obvious
that
he
was
determined
to
get
out
of
minneapolis
at
any
cost
and
use
the
season
tickets
thing
as
an
excuse
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
to
the
penultimate
game
and
the
fans
were
great
people
were
tailgating
and
playing
roller
hockey
in
the
parking
lot
before
the
game
the
attendance
was
so
full
as
to
have
sro
and
the
whole
atmosphere
in
the
centre
was
terrific
minnesota
is
hockey
usa
how
the
nhl
can
so
blithely
let
the
major
league
team
from
there
move
away
is
beyond
me
i
only
hope
they
get
a
new
team
soon
just
my
ali
ali
procrastination
lemer
i
gave
nhl
commissioner
gary
bettman
a
puck
columbia
university
nyc
once
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
trying
to
open
