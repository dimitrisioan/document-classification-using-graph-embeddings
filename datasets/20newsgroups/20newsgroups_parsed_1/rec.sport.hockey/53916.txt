in

the
godfather
writes
was
the
abc
coverage
of
the
kingsflames
game
supposed
to
be
the
way
it
was
shown
in
bc
with
cbc
overriding
the
abc
coverage
when
i
flipped
to
abc
it
was
the
same
commentators
same
commercials
even
my
question
is
was
this
the
real
abc
coverage
or
did
cbc
just
black
out
the
abc
coverage
for
its
own
yes
its
called
simulcast
in
canada
when
a
canadian
station
and
an
american
station
are
showing
the
same
thing
whether
a
sporting
event
or
cheers
on
thursday
night
the
canadian
signal
is
broadcast
over
the
american
station
they
even
do
this
during
the
superbowl
which
has
the
best
commercials
of
any
television
what
do
we
get
here
dumb
canadian
commercials
the
same
ones
weve
seen
for
that
last
year
or
so
im
in
edmonton
and
while
thats
usually
or
at
least
often
the
case
here
we
were
treated
to
the
actual
abc
telecast
of
the
kingsflames
game
im
with
whoever
said
it
earlier
don
witless
er
whitman
is
a
poor
commentator
and
not
just
for
hockey
normally
if
the
oilers
were
still
playing
augh
i
would
turn
off
the
sound
and
listen
to
the
radio
broadcast
to
get
decent
playbyplay
announcing
bart
edmonton
