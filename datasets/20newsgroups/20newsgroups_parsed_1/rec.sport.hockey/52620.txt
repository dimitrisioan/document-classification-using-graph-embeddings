re
spelling
error
on
the
stanley
cup
writes
i
was
reading
a
newspaper
tidbit
that
mentioned
that
there
is
a
grammatical
error
on
the
stanley
cup
this
newspaper
the
union
leader
manchester
new
hampshire
stated
that
one
of
the
years
that
the
new
york
islanders
won
the
cup
the
printing
on
the
actual
cup
stated
new
york
ilanders
can
anyone
verify
this
i
forgot
the
exact
year
that
this
supposedly
occured
any
diehard
islander
fans
know
about
this
the
reason
why
i
am
asking
is
because
the
paper
is
not
very
reliable
we
call
it
the
union
misleader
randy
plymouth
state
college
speaking
of
spelling
errors
on
the
cup
i
wonder
if
the
h
in
pittsburgh
made
it
to
the
cup
you
know
how
funny
people
can
be
about
spelling
pittsburgh
warren
arbogast
darden
visual
communications
with
miles
behind
them
university
of
virginia
and
more
to
go
