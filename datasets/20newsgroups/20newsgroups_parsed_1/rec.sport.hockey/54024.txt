there
are
several
problems
with
the
way
the
game
is
being
presented
to
the
fans
i
feel
that
geographical
names
would
enhance
regional
loyalties
more
than
names
honouring
personages
i
think
a
compromise
would
work
namely
honouring
personages
in
conference
names
and
using
geographical
references
in
the
divisional
names
although
i
still
do
not
think
the
move
will
draw
fans
to
the
game
imo
its
a
cosmetic
change
that
bettman
and
the
owners
hope
will
have
an
effect
and
it
doesnt
say
much
for
the
mentality
of
anybody
it
works
on
either
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
points
system
percentages
as
used
in
the
other
major
sports
are
clearly
more
informative
when
i
look
at
the
nhl
standings
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
quick
calculation
to
account
for
games
in
hand
which
is
almost
always
the
case
some
will
object
to
percentages
claiming
perhaps
that
it
is
an
americanization
of
the
sport
surprise
i
agree
totally
the
points
system
is
fine
if
everybody
at
all
times
has
played
the
same
number
of
games
since
this
is
almost
never
the
case
winning
percentage
is
the
way
to
go
i
dont
particularly
care
if
it
is
an
american
thing
either
if
it
works
