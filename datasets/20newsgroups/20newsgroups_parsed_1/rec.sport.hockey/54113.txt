re
truly
a
sad
day
for
hockey
mom
writes
i
fear
that
within
the
next
decade
or
so
the
only
professional
sports
team
left
in
pittsburgh
will
be
the
steelers
perish
the
thoughtbut
you
know
you
may
be
right
at
least
as
far
as
major
league
professional
sports
teams
go
they
all
seem
to
be
becoming
big
money
games
much
more
so
than
at
any
previous
time
to
think
that
if
i
am
ever
able
to
move
back
home
several
years
from
now
all
that
may
be
there
is
an
ahl
team
at
bestsigh
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
nhl
is
also
expanding
at
the
same
time
as
it
is
dramatically
increasing
the
amount
of
money
needed
to
operate
a
team
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
theres
a
big
shakeout
about
to
occur
in
the
next
few
years
unless
player
salaries
can
somehow
be
brought
under
control
frankly
i
dont
see
how
the
nhls
current
drive
for
expansion
is
supportable
under
its
current
operating
conditions
if
revenue
sharing
and
a
salary
cap
dont
come
into
the
nhl
soon
look
out
