waiting
for
the
tapedelay
to
start
its
nice
that
the
devils
are
starting
out
their
playoffs
on
network
television
too
bad
that
their
playoff
game
has
been
preempted
on
wabcam
for
an
earlyseason
yankees
baseball
game
its
a
win
by
the
texas
rangers
and
theyre
delaying
the
tapedelay
by
another
halfhour
for
the
ballgame
highlights
you
think
thats
bad
im
in
bowling
green
oh
and
we
get
abc
from
toledo
well
the
cable
co
decided
to
totally
preempt
the
game
no
tape
delay
no
nothing
for
a
stupid
telethon
hockey
is
very
big
around
here
too
i
had
to
listen
to
my
penguins
win
on
my
car
radio
out
in
the
parking
lot
i
can
just
be
thankful
for
a
strong
radio
because
being
miles
from
pittsburgh
the
reception
usually
isnt
good
at
all
i
cant
believe
i
picked
it
up
during
the
middle
of
the
day
