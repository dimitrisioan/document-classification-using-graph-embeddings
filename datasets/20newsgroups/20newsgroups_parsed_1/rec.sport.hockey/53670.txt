individual
winners
was
re
where
are
the
doubters
now
hmm
well
since
you
mentioned
it
in
article
mike

writes
lemieux
is
clearly
the
mvp
no
question
here
chip
in
the
masterson
as
well
selanne
wins
the
calder
yep
chelios
the
norris
if
you
asked
me
days
ago
id
agree
with
you
i
now
give
the
nod
to
raymond
bourque
his
play
took
off
the
same
time
the
bs
did
chelios
gets
a
close
second
dunno
who
wins
the
vezina
but
i
suspect
not
potvin
barrasso
finally
gets
his
due
in
a
close
one
over
eddie
the
eagle
coach
of
the
year
is
tricky
burns
did
the
most
with
the
least
raw
talent
king
did
a
good
job
but
the
flames
clearly
underachieved
last
year
brian
sutter
has
done
exceptionally
well
in
his
first
year
with
a
new
team
ditto
demers
page
has
been
blessed
by
the
ripening
and
acquisition
of
young
talent
darryl
sutter
is
having
a
good
year
for
a
rookie
coach
berry
made
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
terry
crisp
worked
minor
miracles
and
bowman
was
bowman
id
pick
burns
but
im
mildly
biased
in
your
case
that
bias
is
acceptable
mine
shows
with
the
norris
pick
so
were
even
im
impressed
with
what
all
the
coaches
you
mentioned
did
but
my
pick
would
be
al
arbour
not
too
many
folks
thought
the
isles
would
be
in
the
playoffs
let
alone
contend
for
rd
in
their
division
granted
that
they
did
have
a
little
help
from
their
cousins
on
broadway
and
i
like
the
islanders
about
as
much
as
i
like
mowing
my
lawn
