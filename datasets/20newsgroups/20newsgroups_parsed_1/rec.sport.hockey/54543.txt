is
it
just
me
or
is
the
camera
work
on
some
of
these
games
really
sad
i
cant
remember
how
many
times
during
the
penguinsdevils
game
they
showed
some
guy
without
the
puck
being
checked
in
the
corner
while
the
puck
was
being
fired
on
goal
in
fact
i
think
they
even
missed
one
goal
completely
because
they
were
showing
two
guys
holding
each
other
in
the
corner
now
the
last
time
i
watched
a
football
game
they
didnt
show
the
lineman
going
at
it
while
the
running
back
turned
the
corner
for
a
touchdown
is
it
just
me
greg
espn
has
been
trying
various
things
to
get
away
from
the
followthepuck
concept
of
televising
hockey
games
one
of
the
main
problems
with
hockey
is
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
show
everything
that
is
going
on
more
happens
away
from
the
puck
than
in
any
other
sport
except
maybe
football
and
they
can
do
isos
on
football
players
to
be
shown
between
plays
the
problem
of
course
is
that
sometimes
you
get
something
worthwhile
other
times
you
get
burned
