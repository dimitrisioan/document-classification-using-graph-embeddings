paul
stewart
is
the
worst
and
most
biased
ref
presently
in
the
nhl
he
called
a
total
of
penalties
on
the
habs
and
one
on
the
nordiques
the
nords
penalty
came
in
ot
stewart
being
an
exnordique
himself
was
looking
to
call
penalties
on
the
habs
while
letting
the
nords
get
away
with
murderwe
was
robbed
if
my
powerplay
was
as
bad
as
montreals
id
be
thanking
stewart
for
calling
as
few
penalties
as
possible
quebecs
powerplay
is
lethal
and
it
is
to
their
advantage
to
have
a
penaltyfilled
game
where
they
can
clean
up
with
their
superior
powerplay
montreal
really
lost
that
game
and
game
because
patrick
roy
is
well
on
his
way
to
having
another
one
of
his
trademark
awful
playoffs
the
man
is
truly
overrated
quebec
has
scored
six
goals
on
roy
and
four
perhaps
five
were
quite
stoppable
