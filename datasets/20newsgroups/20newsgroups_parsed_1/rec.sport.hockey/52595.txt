okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
according
to
what
reasonable
principle
of
justice
does
standing
in
intimate
geographical
and
psychological
relations
to
a
league
give
one
some
privileged
right
to
play
in
it
a
european
