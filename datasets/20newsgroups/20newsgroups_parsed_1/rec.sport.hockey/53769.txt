joe
murphys
goal
shouldnt
have
counted
the
game
would
have
ended
in
tie
i
thought
the
red
light
went
onthus
in
the
review
the
presumption
would
be
to
find
conclusive
evidence
that
the
puck
did
not
go
in
the
netfrom
the
replays
i
say
even
from
the
rear
the
evidence
wasnt
conclusive
that
the
puck
was
in
or
outin
my
opinion
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
objective
is
to
find
conclusive
evidence
that
the
puck
did
cross
the
line
and
the
replays
i
saw
showed
fairly
conclusively
that
the
puck
did
not
cross
the
goal
line
at
any
time
anyway
somebody
screwed
up
