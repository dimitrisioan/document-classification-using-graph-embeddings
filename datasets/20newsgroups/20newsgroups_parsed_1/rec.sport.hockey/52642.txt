this
years
biggest
and
worst
opinion

article
writes
messier
is
a
joke
this
year
bad
back
not
withstanding
his
play
is
the
reason
the
rangers
will
be
on
the
golf
course
in
a
couple
of
weeks
gartner
is
my
choice
the
guy
works
his
butt
off
every
game
kovalev
no
surprise
hes
played
adequately
but
as
bad
defensively
kovalev
is
too
talented
a
player
to
play
for
roger
nielsonroger
needs
players
who
cant
think
for
themselves
and
can
only
skate
in
straight
lines
up
and
down
the
ice
dudley
and
nielson
are
the
only
two
coaches
bad
enough
in
the
league
to
take
talents
like
mogilny
and
kovalev
and
not
know
how
to
turn
them
into
bure
and
selanne
as
was
predicted
in
preseason
perhaps
hell
pull
an
alex
mogilny
in
a
couple
of
years
and
surprise
us
then
zubov
wasnt
expected
to
make
it
out
of
the
minors
this
season
and
owing
to
the
number
of
injuries
has
proved
to
be
a
very
pleasant
surprise
get
muckler
as
coach
and
kovalev
will
look
like
mogilny
the
trouble
with
the
rangers
is
that
neil
smith
went
out
and
got
players
like
messier
kovalev
and
graves
who
have
been
schooled
in
taking
the
game
to
their
opponent
and
attacking
while
hiring
coaches
who
are
interested
in
ropeadope
strategies
if
you
want
the
roger
nielsons
of
the
world
to
be
your
coach
you
dont
go
out
and
get
a
mark
messier
who
is
an
old
dog
who
cant
learn
new
tricks
from
a
known
loser
and
you
dont
waste
your
draft
picks
on
players
like
kovalev
