espn
through
a
fortunate
rainout
of
a
baseball
game
showed
the
red
wingstoronto
game
cool
but
i
swear
that
the
advertisements
all
week
long
had
said
that
espn
would
show
pittnj
on
tuesday
and
bosbuff
on
thursday
i
raced
home
from
work
early
pacific
to
catch
the
game
but
alas
it
was
the
bostonbuffalo
game
and
then
they
promised
that
they
would
show
the
pittnj
game
on
thursday
overnight
they
changed
their
mind
what
the
hell
are
u
talking
about
espn
showed
pensdevils
game
as
advertised
but
the
morons
at
espn
should
know
that
pens
will
kick
devils
ass
and
the
game
will
be
boring
id
rather
see
bostonbuffalo
game
which
seems
to
be
an
exciting
series
since
noone
had
expected
buffalo
to
get
past
the
first
round
well
lets
hope
they
change
their
mind
on
thus
game
and
show
some
other
game
the
pens
series
is
really
getting
boring
i
want
to
see
some
exciting
game
no
matter
who
wins
if
nhl
wants
a
major
network
contract
then
they
better
put
some
brains
in
espn
people
experience
is
what
makes
a
person
make
new
mistakes
instead
of
old
one
