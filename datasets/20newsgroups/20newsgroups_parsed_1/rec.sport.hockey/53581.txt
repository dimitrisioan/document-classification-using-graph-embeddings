it
is
meaningless
to
compare
one
players
plusminus
statistic
with
another
players
out
of
the
context
of
the
role
and
the
playing
time
of
the
players
involved
its
just
as
meaningless
to
compare
goals
assists
pim
and
any
other
stat
i
can
think
of
each
player
is
asked
to
take
a
unique
role
for
his
team
the
contexts
will
never
be
the
same
from
one
player
to
another
playing
on
the
same
team
or
different
teams
and
yet
awards
are
given
and
promotions
received
based
in
part
on
these
meaningless
stats
the
operative
words
are
in
part
stats
must
be
interpreted
tempered
with
other
information
one
has
about
the
player
to
compare
jagrs
and
franciss
plusminus
is
ridiculous
and
absurd
and
comparing
jagrs
and
franciss
points
is
just
as
ridiculous
and
absurd
but
not
more
ridiculous
and
absurd
as
comparing
goals
assists
points
for
selanne
lindros
juneau
potvin
and
the
other
rookies
in
the
league
and
yet
how
about
looking
at
them
for
what
they
are
and
enjoy
the
game
