well
well
they
dont
like
our
defenders
mainly
lumme
and
numminen
about
is
correct
for
numminen
and
lumme
rteemu
selanne
compared
to
kurri
selannes
points
are
too
high
lets
make
it
or
no
kurris
points
are
too
low
for
kurri
and
for
selnne
well
in
the
canada
cup
and
world
championships
largely
due
to
the
efforts
of
markus
ketterer
the
goalie
or
the
players
listed
above
and
luck
theres
presumably
a
lot
of
decent
players
in
finland
that
wouldnt
be
superstars
at
the
highest
level
but
still
valuable
role
players
however
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
wow
now
it
looks
like
you
dont
like
our
players
what
about
guys
like
nieminen
jutila
riihijarvi
varvio
laukkanen
makela
keskinen
and
even
if
he
is
aging
ruotsalainen
the
main
difference
between
finnish
and
north
american
players
is
that
our
players
tend
to
be
better
in
the
larger
rink
the
canadian
defenders
are
usually
slower
that
defenders
in
europe
and
i
think
that
there
was
more
in
our
success
than
ketterer
and
luck
though
they
helped
i
think
that
the
main
reason
was
that
the
team
worked
well
together
thats
true
game
is
so
different
here
in
europe
compared
to
nhl
northame
ricans
are
better
in
small
rinks
and
europeans
in
large
rinks
an
average
european
player
from
sweden
finland
russian
or
tsechslovakia
is
a
better
skater
and
puckhandler
than
his
nhl
colleague
especially
defenders
in
nhl
are
mainly
slow
and
clumsy
selnne
has
also
said
that
in
the
finnish
smleague
game
is
more
based
on
skill
than
in
nhl
in
finland
he
couldnt
get
so
many
breakaways
because
defenders
here
are
an
average
much
better
skaters
than
in
nhl
also
alpo
suhonen
said
that
in
nhl
selnnes
speed
accentuates
because
of
clumsy
defensemen
i
have
to
admit
that
the
best
players
come
from
canada
but
those
regulars
arent
as
skilful
as
regulars
in
the
best
european
leagues
also
top
europeans
are
in
the
same
level
as
the
best
northamericansexcept
lemieux
is
in
the
class
of
his
own
