disturbed
by
thirdman
theme
by
rick
sadowski
daily
news
barry
melroses
decision
to
stick
robb
stauber
in
the
stands
rather
than
in
the
crease
or
even
on
the
bench
for
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
does
not
sit
well
with
the
rookie
goaltender
i
want
to
be
a
part
of
the
team
at
the
most
crucial
time
of
the
year
the
most
fun
time
of
the
year
and
im
not
stauber
said
with
some
emotion
monday
i
think
i
have
worked
hard
enough
for
that
stauber
said
he
accepts
melroses
choice
of
kelly
hrudey
as
the
teams
top
goalie
in
their
playoff
series
with
the
calgary
flames
hrudey
made
saves
in
sundays
opening
victory
but
stauber
clearly
is
upset
with
his
sudden
status
as
the
no
man
behind
rick
knickle
stauber
had
a
record
and
goalsagainst
average
down
the
stretch
in
the
regular
season
and
nearly
wrestled
the
no
job
from
hrudey
knickle
he
won
of
decisions
but
had
a
bloated
average
twice
was
yanked
from
games
once
for
stomach
cramps
and
hasnt
played
since
march
yet
when
the
series
resumes
wednesday
knickle
will
serve
as
hrudeys
backup
again
and
stauber
will
have
to
satisfy
his
playoff
hunger
by
munching
on
olympic
saddledome
popcorn
if
im
supposedly
close
to
being
the
starter
or
could
have
been
the
starteri
dropped
too
what
happened
to
no
stauber
wondered
not
that
id
be
happy
with
no
but
i
feel
i
should
at
least
be
a
part
of
this
team
in
the
playoffs
perhaps
stauber
eventually
will
get
his
chance
but
melrose
apparently
is
not
convinced
the
year
old
is
capable
of
handling
playoff
pressure
while
insisting
he
is
the
kings
goalie
of
the
future
melrose
said
stauber
flubbed
all
four
of
the
big
games
he
was
asked
to
win
this
season
they
were
according
to
melrose
a
loss
to
san
jose
on
dec
an
loss
to
the
new
york
rangers
on
jan
a
tie
with
detroit
on
feb
an
loss
to
vancouver
on
thursday
four
times
this
season
robb
could
have
emerged
as
the
elite
goalie
he
could
have
taken
it
away
from
kelly
hrudey
and
he
didnt
do
it
melrose
said
an
elite
goaltender
has
to
carry
the
ball
when
you
give
it
to
him
the
mark
of
a
great
goalie
is
that
he
isnt
satisfied
to
be
a
backup
im
not
blaming
robb
for
the
losses
but
if
youre
going
to
be
no
youve
got
to
be
able
to
walk
your
talk
youve
got
to
be
able
to
play
when
everything
is
on
the
line
robb
stauber
has
a
great
deal
of
ability
but
maybe
i
expect
more
from
him
than
he
does
ouch
that
remark
stung
stauber
he
began
the
season
struggled
when
the
team
hit
a
midseason
slump
didnt
play
for
a
month
after
knickle
was
signed
off
the
san
diego
gulls
roster
then
came
on
at
the
end
i
expect
more
from
myself
than
anybody
including
barry
melrose
said
stauber
a
threeyear
star
at
the
university
of
minnesota
who
left
school
in
only
to
have
his
development
hampered
by
a
string
of
serious
injuries
what
ive
been
through
the
last
four
years
two
knee
operations
a
herniated
disk
in
my
back
shoulder
surgery
what
more
can
i
go
through
i
obviously
do
expect
a
lot
from
myself
otherwise
i
wouldnt
be
here
anybody
who
would
disagree
with
that
doesnt
know
me
im
not
saying
barry
doesnt
know
me
but
dont
say
ive
been
without
expectations
if
anything
im
a
perfectionist
stauber
acknowledged
he
played
poorly
in
the
four
games
melrose
mentioned
but
even
though
i
didnt
play
well
i
get
knocked
down
from
maybe
on
to
three
its
a
bit
of
a
jump
he
said
youre
almost
no
or
if
you
play
a
good
game
youre
no
and
if
you
dont
youre
no
why
does
jack
nicklaus
shoot
a
and
then
a
can
you
explain
that
thats
what
barry
wanted
me
to
explain
to
him
why
i
didnt
come
through
when
he
counted
on
me
i
dont
know
what
i
do
know
is
its
a
sport
ill
be
there
melroses
goalie
of
the
future
statement
doesnt
mean
much
to
stauber
before
you
know
it
ill
be
and
there
will
be
no
future
