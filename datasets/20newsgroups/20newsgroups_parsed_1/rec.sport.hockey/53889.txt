the
san
jose
sharks
and
ottawa
senators
are
each
on
their
second
gm
alreadyid
be
willing
to
wager
that
both
the
sharks
and
senators
will
probably
see
their
rd
gms
and
perhaps
their
th
before
we
see
the
panthers
second
actually
firedcoach
george
kingston
was
a
third
of
the
gm
triumvirate
now
that
the
trio
is
now
duo
dean
lombardi
and
chuck
grillo
the
sharks
are
already
on
their
rd
office
of
the
gm
and
a
th
is
likely
to
happen
before
september
theyll
either
add
the
new
coach
to
the
oofgm
or
name
a
single
gm
so
your
wager
should
be
amended
to
read
that
sharks
are
likely
to
have
their
th
gm
before
the
panthers
get
their
nd
cant
wait
to
see
how
the
next
seasons
nhl
guide
and
record
book
lists
the
gm
history
of
the
sharks
given
the
depth
of
next
years
draft
the
expansion
draft
rules
and
the
reputation
of
their
gms
anaheim
and
miami
look
pretty
good
as
the
first
s
expansion
teams
to
win
a
cup
san
jose
and
ottawa
have
instability
at
the
gm
position
something
that
philly
nyi
edmonton
and
calgary
did
not
have
when
they
won
their
first
cups
pittsburgh
did
but
they
needed
a
quarter
century
mike
eisler
not
only
are
they
leafs
the
best
team
but
their
fans
are
even
more
intelligent
and
insightful
than
pittsburghs
their
players
are
mighty
bright
too
i
mean
he
really
was
going
to
get
his
wallet
