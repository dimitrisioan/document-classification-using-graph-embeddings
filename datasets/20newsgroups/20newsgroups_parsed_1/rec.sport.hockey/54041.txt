felix
potvin
deserves
to
have
the
sh
kicked
out
of
him
if
there
is
anyone
that
he
should
be
hitting
with
his
stick
its
his
pussy
defensemen
who
cant
seem
to
move
big
dino
ciccerelli
lbs
out
from
in
front
of
the
net
obviously
toronto
has
realized
that
they
are
overmatched
by
the
wings
and
must
rely
on
trying
to
antagonize
the
superior
red
wings
with
cheap
shots
i
prefer
to
watch
hockey
than
seeing
shots
of
felix
potvin
slashing
and
spearing
dino
ciccerelli
standing
in
front
of
the
net
he
has
every
right
to
stand
in
front
of
the
net
just
not
in
the
crease
yes
he
does
but
the
goalie
sure
as
hell
doesnt
want
him
there
when
i
played
roller
hockey
boy
do
i
miss
those
days
as
a
goalie
i
would
scream
at
my
defense
to
clear
guys
out
of
the
slot
i
dont
care
if
hes
in
the
crease
or
not
get
him
the
hell
away
from
me
so
i
can
see
the
ball
yes
roller
hockey
remember
and
if
there
was
nobody
around
to
clear
the
slot
then
id
do
it
myself
by
pushing
the
offending
playerhard
i
hate
people
in
my
way
when
im
the
goalie
and
i
am
sure
felix
does
too
i
should
say
that
i
didnt
see
the
incident
so
if
potvin
really
swung
the
stick
big
time
then
thats
not
right
but
he
can
move
people
out
of
the
way
hes
a
player
on
the
ice
too
you
know
keith
keller
lets
go
rangers
ivy
league
champs
in
this
corner
lets
go
quakers
weighing
in
at
almost
every
weight
imaginable
life
and
all
that
surrounds
