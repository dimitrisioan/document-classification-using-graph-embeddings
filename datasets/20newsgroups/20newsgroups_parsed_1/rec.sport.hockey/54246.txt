some
people
in
the
discussion
group
as

as
commentator
al
on
espn
believe
that
game
is
critical
for
the
sabres
helloooo
the
sabres
are
ahead
games
to
not
behind
as
a
lifelong
sabres
fan
i
am
well
aware
of
their
ability
to
choke
but
lets
not
exaggerate
that
as
long
as
the
sabres
win
one
of
the
next
games
be
it
game
or
game
they
are
still
in
good
shape
ahead
games
to
with
game
to
be
played
at
buffalo
if
they
lose
games
three
and
four
then
start
worrying
game
is
critical
for
