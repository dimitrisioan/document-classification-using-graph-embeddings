re
winning
streaks
you
might
want
to
clarify
the
game
winning
streak
that
pens
streak
is
a
playoff
streak
tied
by
the
chicago
blackhawks
who
had
won
in
a
row
until
they
met
the
pens
in
the
finals
last
year
the
game
unbeaten
so
far
is
a
regular
season
unbeaten
streak
but
hey
dont
take
it
personally
im
a
flyers
fan
and
two
in
a
row
is
a
stretch
but
with
a
healthy
lindros
recchi
brindamour
and
tommy
soderstrom
theyll
be
there
next
year
by
the
way
since
the
flyers
need
defenseman
what
kind
of
trade
would
anybody
suggest
from
the
existing
flyers
roster
since
the
scuttlebutt
is
that
terry
carkner
wont
be
there
next
year
and
apart
from
him
a
piece
of
notebook
paper
would
be
better
defense
matt
weaver
properly
found
at
hey
at
least
were
not
the
whalers
