well
i
was
a
little
off
in
those
predictions
one
i
didnt
count
on
the
devils
scoring
goals
tonight
in
a
tie
hence
there
goes
the
streak
secondly
i
didnt
count
on
the
islanders
getting
just
point
out
of
against
the
whalers
in
two
games
so
no
more

new
predicitons
penguins
vs
islanders
penguins
in
or
capitals
vs
devils
devils
in
why
should
we
pay
your
predictions
any
heed
considering
you
couldnt
even
predict
the
proper
matchups
maybe
you
should
try
forecasting
the
weather
instead
