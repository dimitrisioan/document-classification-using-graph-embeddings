pray
lots
well
im
a
wings
fan
and
i
think
the
first
thing
that
you
should
do
is
to
get
the
opponents
line
combinations
correct
before
you
try
to
match
up
anyone
with
them
there
is
no
yzermanfedorovprobert
line
except
for
maybe
on
a
powerplay
these
three
players
usually
play
on
three
different
lines
which
would
mean
that
torontos
checking
line
would
have
to
pull
a
triple
shift
the
wings
lines
usually
look
like
this
