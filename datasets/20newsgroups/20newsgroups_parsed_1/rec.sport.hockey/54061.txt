re
trivia
question
what
sadist
brought
up
this
vein
about
malarchuk
when
i
saw
what
happened
i
wanted
to
throw
up
and
at
the
same
time
i
was
devastated
since
i
thought
that
malarchuk
wouldnt
survive
btw
i
believe
he
picked
up
an
alcohol
problem
after
before
the
incident
to
radically
change
the
subject
the
caps
must
be
having
nightmares
about
the
isles
in
overtime
in
the
playoffs
have
they
ever
beaten
the
islanders
in
a
playoff
ot
game
this
is
lunacy
the
caps
are
such
a
sorry
team
in
the
playoffs
they
consistently
choke
against
opponents
who
they
should
be
beating
losing
two
ot
games
in
a
row
is
not
coincidence
its
evidence
of
the
choke
factor
