writes
good
for
you
youd
only
be
displaying
your
ignorance
of
course
but
to
each
his
own
roger
im
not
sure
here
but
i
think
ignorance
is
really
a
function
of
a
lack
of
knowledge
and
not
formulating
an
opinionbut
hey
if
you
need
to
take
a
cheap
shot
then
by
all
means
go
aheadthats
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
to
knowledgeable
observers
of
the
game
my
meaning
is
obvious
your
hockey
education
is
not
my
responsibility
just
curious
roger
but
since
you
have
such
a
vast
knowledge
of
the
game
and
the
league
how
come
you
havent
made
a
living
out
of
it
there
must
be
a
lot
of
demand
for
expertise
in
the
field
im
sure
youd
be
of
great
help
to
say
the
leafs
as
an
assistant
coach
or
a
scout
or
maybe
try
a
career
as
a
reporter
or
tv
commentator
i
might
be
wrong
of
course
and
you
already
have
jukka
a
virtanen
