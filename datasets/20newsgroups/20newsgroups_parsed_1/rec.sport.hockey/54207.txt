los
angeles
en
route

the
shutout

was
easier
than
on
wednesday
in
game
when
joseph
had
to
make
saves
this
time
the
blues
held
the
shots
down
to
and
the
blackhawks
couldnt
touch
joseph
well
they
touched
joseph
numerous
times
shoving
him
and
pushing
him
at
every
opportunity
to
try
to
get
him
off
his
game
but
joseph
and
the
blues
were
unfazed
dishing
out
their
own
punishment
along
the
way
the
blues
grinders
bob
bassen
rich
sutter
kevin
miller
and
dave
lowry
wore
down
the
blackhawks
taking
the
visitors
from
chicago
off
their
game
the
grinders
set
the
stage
for
the
glamour
boys
the
gifted
playmakers
and
scorers
who
made
the
most
of
their
opportunities
craig
janney
brett
hull
and
nelson
emerson
scored
getting
one
goal
in
each
period
hull
assisted
on
janneys
firstperiod
power
play
goal
after
two
unwise
chicago
penalties
checker
miller
set
up
hulls
goal
in
the
second
period
and
rookie
denny
felsner
assisted
for
emerson
who
scored
at
of
the
final
period
blues
fans
jumped
to
their
feet
in
celebration
of
that
goal
and
began
yelling
sweep
sweep
sweep
they
also
taunted
chicago
goalie
ed
belfour
bellfour
bellfour
they
also
chanted
na
nanana
heyhey
good
bye
such
talk
is
a
tad
premature
theres
still
one
game
left
but
the
blues
are
on
a
roll
they
have
the
blackhawks
on
their
heels
the
blues
set
the
tone
early
on
friday
with
two
crunching
hits
in
the
first
minute
of
play
rich
sutter
leveled
bryan
marchment
and
brendan
shanahan
dumped
steve
smith
at
center
ice
chicago
tried
to
retaliate
but
troy
murrays
decision
to
run
into
joseph
backfired
referee
dan
marouelli
gave
him
a
roughing
penalty
the
blues
didnt
get
a
shot
on
goal
on
the
power
play
and
they
survived
a
scare
after
chicago
killed
the
penalty
when
rick
zombo
gave
the
puck
away
to
steve
larmer
joseph
stopped
larmers
shot
and
everything
else
chicago
threw
at
him
in
the
first
period
the
hawks
ignored
the
scouting
report
on
joseph
about
shooting
high
and
continued
to
shoot
low
where
josephs
butterfly
style
is
deadly
rookie
bret
hedican
picked
up
three
consecutive
penalties
midway
through
the
period
two
for
hooking
and
one
for
holding
but
chicago
got
only
two
shots
on
goal
as
many
as
miller
the
blues
penalty
killer
twice
stole
the
puck
and
just
missed
on
good
scoring
chances
against
belfour
marouelli
began
calling
penalties
on
the
blackhawks
to
even
things
up
he
caught
brent
sutter
hooking
shanahan
four
seconds
after
hedicans
third
penalty
he
called
marchment
for
elbowing
janney
along
the
boards
at
and
gave
the
blues
a
twoman
advantage
later
when
christian
ruuttu
slashed
shanahan
the
blues
worked
around
the
puck
on
the
ensuing
power
play
and
hull
got
it
where
he
likes
it
in
the
high
slot
hulls
shot
hit
belfours
right
shoulder
and
the
puck
bounced
precariously
close
to
the
goal
line
belfour
dived
back
to
cover
but
the
puck
squirted
loose
to
janney
who
poked
it
into
the
net
at
for
his
first
goal
of
the
playoffs
the
blues
continued
their
relentless
hitting
as
the
period
ended
and
the
blackhawks
lost
their
composure
joe
murphy
tripped
ron
wilson
with
two
seconds
remaining
in
the
period
and
after
time
had
expired
smith
upset
the
blues
by
shooting
the
puck
into
the
blues
bench
chris
chelios
made
a
move
toward
joseph
as
the
teams
left
the
ice
and
marouelli
slapped
him
with
a
minute
misconduct
chicago
survived
the
blues
power
play
but
the
loss
of
chelios
hurt
he
didnt
return
until
the
midway
point
of
the
period
and
within
three
minutes
of
his
return
hull
had
increased
the
blues
lead
to
deflecting
in
millers
crisp
pass
try
as
they
might
the
blackhawks
couldnt
get
to
joseph
who
stopped
everything
they
could
throw
at
him
he
stopped
shots
in
the
second
period
and
more
in
the
third
chicago
also
hit
the
goalpost
twice
emersons
goal
put
the
game
away
he
went
hard
to
the
net
and
