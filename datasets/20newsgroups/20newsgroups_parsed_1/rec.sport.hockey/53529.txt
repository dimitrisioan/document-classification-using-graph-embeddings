anyway
this
game
continued
a
trend
that
has
sadly
been
taking
shape
for
a
couple
of
weeks
now
i
had
hoped
it
was
fatigue
or
an
aberration
but
i
cant
snow
myself
any
longer
alex
mogilny
must
be
benched
as
a
disciplinary
action
and
soon
his
explanation
for
ysebaert
jumping
between
him
and
lafontaine
to
score
the
winning
goal
yesterday
wasnt
my
guy
ask
patty
about
it
actually
this
stuff
from
mogilny
doesnt
surprise
me
all
that
much
about
or
weeks
ago
i
read
in
the
toronto
sun
a
quote
from
alex
it
went
something
like
sarcastically
yep
pattys
the
man
hes
responsible
for
the
teams
successim
a
nobody
around
here
i
was
going
to
post
it
at
the
timei
must
have
forgot
since
nobody
else
was
talking
about
him
being
a
problem
if
i
heard
that
in
the
locker
room
id
beat
the
shit
out
of
him
on
the
spot
patty
took
responsibility
in
the
press
taking
the
heat
off
of
alex
thats
because
lafontaine
is
the
epitome
of
class
and
a
consummate
team
player
yep
id
beat
the
shit
out
of
him
too
lafontaine
really
must
be
a
team
playermakes
you
wonder
what
the
islander
management
was
thinking
my
question
is
what
the
hell
is
muckler
doing
whether
he
wishes
to
admit
it
or
not
the
team
is
his
to
coach
and
if
he
cant
do
the
job
then
maybe
the
job
should
be
given
to
somebody
who
can
gee
kinda
like
alexs
spot
on
the
team
isnt
it
drd
the
devils
advocate
