im
sorry
to
tell
you
this
but
unless
they
pull
off
another
miracle
there
is
no
way
the
habs
will
win
this
year
ever
since
they
traded
for
ramage
and
since
savard
came
off
injury
they
have
been
playing
shinny
and
you
cant
blame
roy
for
the
loss
to
washington
when
players
could
not
score
one
goal
i
know
you
think
i
am
a
boston
fan
but
all
of
my
years
have
been
dedicated
to
les
habs
david
degan
well
it
seems
that
the
habs
have
been
much
talkedabout
of
late
so
heres
my
these
guys
have
absolutely
no
concept
of
how
to
play
in
front
of
the
damn
net
watch
them
in
the
offensive
zone
especially
on
the
powerplay
damphousse
or
lebeau
will
skate
all
over
the
bloody
zone
maybe
pass
to
the
point
get
it
back
skate
some
more
pass
it
aroundbut
wheres
the
shot
answer
the
shot
is
totally
useless
because
they
lack
a
forward
who
stands
in
front
of
the
net
a
la
neely
shanahan
tocchet
etc
etc
too
bad
demers
wont
put
dipietro
or
leclair
on
the
powerplay
more
often
dammit
even
ewen
would
at
least
cause
some
disruptions
montreal
desperately
needs
a
power
forward
with
some
talent
imo
then
watch
them
in
their
own
zone
patrick
roy
is
screened
on
everything
say
what
you
want
about
his
performance
imnsho
he
can
not
stop
what
he
can
not
see
and
montreals
defence
does
a
miserable
job
of
clearing
the
front
of
the
net
last
night
against
washington
roy
played
a
great
game
the
first
goal
came
on
the
most
ridiculous
goalmouth
scramble
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
and
he
didnt
have
a
hope
in
hell
of
stopping
the
shot
the
second
goal
came
on
a
deflection
of
a
shot
he
only
partially
saw
anyway
pathetic
defence
the
third
goal
was
en
no
wonder
he
gets
pissed
off
at
his
defencemen
