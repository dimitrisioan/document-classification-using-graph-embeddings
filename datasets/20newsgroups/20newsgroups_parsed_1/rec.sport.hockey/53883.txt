of

mike
ramsey
was
at
one
time
the
captain
in
buffalo
prior
to
being
traded
to
pittsburgh
currently
the
penguins
have
former
captains
and
real
captain
lemieux
playing
for
them

rotate
the
as
during
the
season
and
even
the
c
while
mario
was
out
even
troy
loney
has
worn
the
c
for
the
pens
i
think
that

sabres
when
he
got
traded
to
the
leafs
also
wasnt
rick
vaive
the
captain
of
the
leafs
when
he
got
traded
to
chicago
with
steve
thomas
for
ed
olcyzk
and
someone
speaking
of
the
leafs
i
believe
that
darryl
sittler
was
their
captain
hed
torn
the
c
off
his
jersey
but
i
think
he
reclaimed
the
captaincy
later
on
when
he
was
traded
to
the
flyers
oh
yeah
of
course
gretzky

the
captain
of
the
oilers
before
he
was
traded

he
dale
hawerchuk
and
troy
murray
were
both
captains
of
the
jets
when
they
were
traded
murray
this
year
in
midseason

a
few
years
ago

the
offseason
