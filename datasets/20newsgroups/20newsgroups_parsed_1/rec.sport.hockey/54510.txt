shame
im
a
hockey
fan
from
way
back
and
maintain
an
interest
as
best
i
can
here
in
the
hockey
hinterlands
oklahoma
im
hoping
i
can
get
a
reading
from
some
of
you
about
the
move
of
the
north
stars
to
dallas
ive
been
under
the
impression
that
minnesota
was
one
of
or
possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
as
much
as
id
like
to
see
the
nhl
only
a
hour
drive
from
me
i
cant
help
but
feel
for
the
people
in
minnesota
unless
they
truly
didnt
support
the
team
opinions
please
