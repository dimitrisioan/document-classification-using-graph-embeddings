he
was
already
offered
million
for
them
from
northlands
coliseum
but
refused
the
offer
i
dont
think
he
is
going
to
sale
i
think
he
may
decide
to
move
the
team
to
the
states
though
where
he
can
draw
more
revenue
from
the
team
pocklington
just
wanted
to
wake
up
the
powers
that
be
holding
political
office
in
northlands
and
in
the
business
community
that
the
oilers
with
their
current
lease
arrangement
are
in
a
state
where
on
a
yearly
basis
they
will
likely
have
an
operating
loss
based
on
normal
hockey
revenues
and
expenses
that
he
did
this
was
a
good
thingit
is
better
he
complain
early
and
make
the
city
aware
of
a
potential
looming
crisis
before
he
begins
to
lose
millions
and
millions
of
dollarswhich
would
truly
jeopardize
the
franchise
pocklingtons
first
option
is
not
to
sell
or
to
move
but
to
sell
a
minority
share
of
the
team
to
realize
some
of
the
appreciated
value
of
the
team
and
to
get
a
better
arena
deal
either
in
northlands
or
via
a
new
building
pocklington
probably
isnt
going
to
get
exactly
what
he
wantsbut
ultimately
he
will
probably
get
enough
or
will
sell
to
someone
who
will
probably
get
enough
there
are
a
lot
of
risks
in
moving
a
team
also
one
has
to
remember
peter
pucks
principleit
is
better
to
spend
other
peoples
money
than
ones
own
if
at
all
possible
