with
the
kind
of
team
montreal
has
now
they
can
take
the
cup
easily
the
only
problem
they
have
right
now
is
that
everyone
is
trying
to
steal
the
show
and
play
alone
they
need
some
massive
teamwork
this
is
known
as
the
savard
syndrome
and
we
are
talking
denis
not
serge
no
team
will
ever
win
squat
with
the
likes
of
denis
savard
in
their
lineup
they
are
also
in
a
little
of
a
slump
because
longtime
hockey
montreal
canadiens
announcer
claude
mouton
died
last
tuesday
and
it
was
rough
on
everybody
because
he
has
worked
with
the
organization
for
years
but
i
know
that
is
no
excuse
but
if
the
habs
manage
to
get
some
good
teamwork
and
get
into
the
spirit
they
should
have
no
problem
winning
in
may
they
could
tell
savard
to
stay
home
and
watch
the
games
on
tv
i
agree
i
also
think
roy
needs
a
good
kick
sometimesthat
horrible
loss
to
the
capitals
last
weekyeeeech
heres
to
cup
this
year
sounds
like
to
me
cordially
as
always
