the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
you
know
youre
absolutely
right
i
think
we
should
round
up
all
those
players
of
european
descent
and
ship
em
back
to
where
they
came
from
lets
see
with
whom
should
we
start
i
dunno
lemieux
hmmmsounds
like
he
has
french
blood
in
him
hey
france
is
part
of
europe
send
that
euroblooded
boy
back
sheesh
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
i
just
dont
want
them
on
mine
i
dont
think
it
would
be
hard
to
find
some
native
americans
or
native
canadians
for
that
matter
who
would
dispute
your
claim
to
this
great
continent
of
ours
ya
see
if
you
believe
the
anthropologists
were
all
immigrants
of
some
sort
if
you
really
dont
think
that
mogilny
bure
selanne
et
al
have
improved
the
nhl
then
im
not
sure
you
understand
the
game
