jeez
i
hope
not

writes

the
way
i
am
canadian
play
a
little
and
watched
hockey
night
in
canada
never
missed
a
show
well
thats
really
great
pat
i
guess
since
youve
played
a
little
you
thereby
qualify
as
an
expert
especially
since
you
watch
all
the
games
on
tv
all
that
qualifies
you
as
is
a
armchair
quarterback
or
a
coach
potato
not
that
i
condone
violence
but
ill
make
an
exception
for
mario
pat
walker
again
just
further
evidence
as
to
what
kind
of
an
expert
you
are
truly
a
stupid
statement
mario
is
definately
one
of
the
best
players
to
play
the
game
im
not
saying
he
is
the
best
to
ever
play
the
game
but
he
should
come
to
mind
when
that
question
is
asked
lets
face
it
he
just
returns
from
radiation
therapy
with
around
a
dozen
games
left
overtakes
lafontaine
for
the
scoring
lead
and
then
buries
him
no
i
guess
he
just
got
lucky
speaking
of
lafontaine
now
theres
a
guy
who
should
be
considered
for
the
hart
trophy
as
well
certainly
one
of
the
better
players
in
the
league
this
year
