playoff
record
as
the
head
coach
in
stl
wasnt
very
impressive
his
blues
teams
were
eliminated
very
early
in
the
playoffs
it
doesnt
look
like
this
trend
will
change
with
the
bruins
bruins
have
never
come
back
to
win
after
falling
behind
in
their
entire
year
history
it
doesnt
look
like
buffalo
will
just
lose
their
next
two
games
at
the
aud
with
the
way
fuhr
has
been
standing
on
his
head
basicallythe
bruins
will
be
on
the
golf
course
by
next
weekend
alsoit
seems
like
the
whole
boston
area
has
gone
baseball
crazy
after
an
incredibly
great
start
by
the

soxbest
record
in
their
major
leagues
as

now
i
would
say
that
of
the
callers

talking
