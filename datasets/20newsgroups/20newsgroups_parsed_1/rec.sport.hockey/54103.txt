don

william
k
willis
writes
as
a
person
who
has
rarely
even
seen
don
cherry
and
doesnt
know
anything
about
him
i
dont
know
whether
it
is
just
this
area
pittsburgh
of
the
usa
that
is
deprived
of
his
broadcasts
or
whether
hes
a
canadian
thing
altogether
seriously
what
is
he
all
about
i
know
he
was
a
coach
at
one
time
and
from
the
volume
of
posts
about
him
someone
surely
is
getting
a
steady
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
read
about
on
the
net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
got
ta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
for
those
of
you
who
complain
about
don
cherry
and
wonder
why
he
is
popular
the
reply
is
dick
vitale
and
john
madden
and
bobby
knight
and
joe
garagiola
and
howard
cosell
john
madden
picks
gary
clark
of
the
redskins
for
his
allmadden
team
a
lot
over
much
better
receiversfor
much
the
same
reasons
cherry
sings
the
praises
of
doug
gilmoura
little
guy
with
heartyet
one
doesnt
see
a
string
of
american
posts
saying
that
john
madden
has
lost
his
marbles
dick
vitale
is
always
promoting
this
kid
from
this
high
school
or
that
college
with
outrageous
statements
why
should
americans
expect
that
canada
would
not
have
such
characters
in
relation
to
our
greatest
passionwhich
is
hockey
canadians
are
very
similar
to
americansculturally
our
sports
are
just
hockey
and
curling
whereas
with
americans
it
is
footballbasketballbaseball
and
bowling
