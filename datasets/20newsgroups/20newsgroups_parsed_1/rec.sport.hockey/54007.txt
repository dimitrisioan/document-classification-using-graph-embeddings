randy
graca
seems
to
think
murray
is
the
best
gm
in
the
league
i
think
quinn
is
one
of
several
who
are
better
plus
his
team
quinns
has
improved
a
much
greater
amount
than
detroit
since
he
took
over
with
them
how
do
you
figure
both
vancouver
and
detroit
did
the
same
thing
last
year
they
both
won
their
division
they
had
close
to
the
same
number
of
points
they
both
went
down
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoffs
before
finally
escaping
in
games
and
they
both
got
knocked
out
in
the
second
round
by
teams
they
should
have
been
able
to
beat
with
less
talent
specifically
if
i
remember
correctly
third
place
teams
how
does
this
make
vancouver
more
improved
further
if
im
not
mistaken
the
wings
had
more
points
than
vancouver
at
the
end
of
this
season
albeit
not
many
when
quinn
took
over
vancouver
several
years
ago
not
last
year
they
regularily
missed
the
playoffs
i
cant
recall
if
they
missed
the
playoffs
the
year
before
his
hiring
but
they
probably
did
quinn
has
improved
the
team
from
nonplayoff
calibre
to
a
serious
contender
when
murray
took
over
in
detroit
the
were
about
a
team
that
was
a
contender
to
win
the
norris
division
and
possibly
even
a
stanley
cup
contender
so
quinn
has
improved
his
team
more
than
murray
has
since
taking
over
as
a
gm
quinn
is
one
example
of
a
better
gm
than
murray
