nords
habs
in
ot
we
was
robbed
aargh
paul
stewart
is
the
worst
and
most
biased
ref
presently
in
the
nhl
he
called
a
total
of
penalties
on
the
habs
and
one
on
the
nordiques
the
nords
penalty
came
in
ot
stewart
being
an
exnordique
himself
was
looking
to
call
penalties
on
the
habs
while
letting
the
nords
get
away
with
murderwe
was
robbed
it
was
an
excellent
game
with
plenty
of
endtoend
rushes
and
tremendous
goalkeeping
the
nords
tied
it
with
over
minute
to
go
while
lebeau
was
serving
a
penalty
i
dont
mind
stewart
calling
a
penalty
in
the
last
min
of
the
game
but
at
least
be
fair
about
it
the
nords
were
caught
with
their
hand
in
the
cookie
jar
more
than
once
stewart
turned
the
other
cheekbastard
patrick
roy
collapsed
after
letting
in
the
tieing
goal
he
was
shaky
and
on
his
knees
for
the
rest
of
the
night
the
winning
goal
shouldnt
have
gone
in
dont
get
me
wrong
im
not
blaming
the
loss
on
stewart
the
habs
had
plenty
of
chances
to
capitalize
muller
leclair
haller
etc
but
failed
to
put
the
puck
in
the
net
thats
what
did
them
in
but
mr
stewart
didnt
help
matters
at
all
oh
well
at
least
the
bruins
lost
in
ot
also
