after
watching
the
pengiuns
all
year
and
as
many
other
teams
as
possible
ive
really
noticed
an
increase
in
tom
barassos
cheap
shots
this
year
and
not
noticed
a
corrsponding
increase
with
other
goaltenders
have
a
look
at
ed
belfour
he
also
kicked
john
mclean
of
course
he
wasnt
called
for
that
belfour
kicked
gerrard
gallant
when
the
wings
played
the
hawks
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
no
penalty
no
review
no
suspension
this
was
after
he
attacked
bob
probert
in
the
previous
period
he
was
penalized
for
that
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
barasso
is
the
dirtiest
golatender
since
hextall
hes
also
very
good
likewise
belfour
too
bad
he
goes
down
so
much
