re
ron
francis
not
to
mention
mr
francis
is
an
incredibly
nice
person
over
christmas
break
a
friend
of
mine
had
a
little
xmas
gathering
the
two
of
us
drove
to
rons
house
while
i
stayed
in
the
car
out
of
shyness
my
friend
went
to
the
door
and
rang
the
bell
ron
answered
and
my
friend
introduced
himself
he
then
proceeded
to
invite
francis
to
the
party
ron
declined
because
he
had
to
watch
his
daughter
he
then
reached
out
and
shook
my
friends
hand
i
know
this
isnt
rsb
but
i
dont
think
barry
bonds
would
be
this
polite
in
this
situation
