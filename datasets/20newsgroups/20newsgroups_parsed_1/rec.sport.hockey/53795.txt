whining
already
i
should
have
guessed
its
time
for
the
annual
pittsburgh
penguins
whineathon
bowman
was
complaning
about
cheap
shots
by
the
devils
in
game
im
sorry
mr
bowman
youre
a
great
coach
but
those
cheap
shots
were
nothing
compared
to
whats
going
to
come
also
i
guess
you
were
only
able
to
notice
the
cheap
shots
made
by
the
guys
not
in
white
its
amazing
what
those
black
and
gold
colored
glasses
will
do
ps
nice
dive
on
that
high
stick
mario
everyone
knew
it
was
a
high
stick
you
could
have
stayed
on
your
feet
and
saved
your
diving
talent
for
later
just
stirring
it
up
a
bit
