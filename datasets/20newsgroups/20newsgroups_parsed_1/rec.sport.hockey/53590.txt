nh
you
mention
could
cut
it
as
stars
in
the
nhl
even
rexi
in
his
prime
was
more
of
a
good
regular
in
new
yorkedmonton
than
a
superstar
in
his
own
right
although
some
blamed
that
on
lack
of
effort
on
his
behalf
i
think
that
the
ny
management
made
a
mistake
and
remember
how
edmonton
called
reksa
in
the
middle
of
the
season
to
win
the
cup
why
did
they
call
him
yeah
weve
had
a
tendency
to
beat
ourselves
in
the
past
i
almost
knifed
my
brother
in
anger
when
sweden
scored
two
in
the
final
minute
of
the
wc
semifinals
back
in
or
what
about
the
three
goals
antero
kivela
let
in
with
five
minutes
to
go
against
the
russkies
in
lake
placid
ugh
ok
that
was
bad
luck
if
penguins
have
the
same
kind
of
luck
this
year
in
the
playoffs
theyll
never
win
the
cup
they
are
still
the
best
team
