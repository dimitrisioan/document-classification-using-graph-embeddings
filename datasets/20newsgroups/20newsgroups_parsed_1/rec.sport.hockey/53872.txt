has

ronnie
francis
has
had
a
much
better
season
than
jaromir
jagr
this
is
not
to
take
anything
away
from
jaro
who
had
a
decent
year
although
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
expectations
of
some
bowman
tended
to
overplay
francis
at
times
because
he
is
a
bowmanstyle
player
he
plays
hard
at
all
times
doesnt
disregard
his
defensive
responsibilities
and
is
a
good
leader
bowman
rewarded
him
be
increasing
his
ice
time
jagr
can
be
very
arrogant
and
juvenile
and
display
a
me
first
attitude
this
rubbed
bowman
the
wrong
way
and
caused
him
to
lose
some
ice
time
throughout
the
year
francis
consistently
recieved
more
ice
time
than
jagr
althouhg
i
have
never
seen
stats
on
this
subject
i
am
pretty
sure
that
jagr
had
more
points
per
minute
played
that
francis
when
you
add
to
that
jagrs
better
rating
i
think
it
becomes
evident
that
jagr
had
a
better
season
not
that
francis
had
a
bad
one
