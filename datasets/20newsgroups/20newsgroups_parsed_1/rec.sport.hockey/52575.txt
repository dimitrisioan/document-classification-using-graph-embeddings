i
was
wtahcing
right
guard
hockey
week
on
tsn
yesterday
and
they
had
a
feature
on
this
guy
that
does
a
lot
most
of
the
masks
for
nhl
goalies
they
talked
about
how
they
are
made
what
they
are
made
of
and
the
designs
that
are
put
on
them
etc
actually
this
part
was
really
interesting
it
turns
out
that
the
mask
is
customfit
to
the
goalies
face
the
goalie
puts
hisher
face
through
a
piece
of
wood
or
was
it
plastic
with
a
hole
in
it
that
allows
only
the
face
and
forehead
to
show
hair
is
covered
by
a
cap
eyes
are
covered
by
a
plastic
wraptype
material
and
vaseline
is
put
on
the
goaltenders
face
then
a
plaster
is
spread
on
their
cheeks
forehead
and
chin
which
takes
about
minutes
to
dry
sufficiently
when
it
dries
it
is
effectively
a
mold
of
the
goalies
face
this
is
used
as
the
basis
of
the
mask
the
rest
involves
padding
the
inside
hardening
the
exterior
fitting
the
cage
etc
etc
john
blue
of
the
bruins
actually
demonstrated
the
procedure
on
the
show
he
exhibited
a
couple
masks
he
is
currently
working
on
namely
a
new
mask
for
andy
moog
which
is
a
basic
reworking
of
his
current
mask
with
the
bear
on
it
and
new
mask
for
bob
essensa
which
was
really
cool
the
jets
logo
was
on
the
chin
and
there
were
two
fighter
jets
on
either
side
on
the
forehead
with
an
airbrushed
background
yeah
essensas
mask
looked
really
good
the
best
one
of
all
was
one
he
never
talked
about
he
just
held
it
up
it
has
the
current
leafs
crest
on
the
chin
and
an
awesome
looking
black
panther
on
the
forehead
it
has
to
be
a
new
mask
for
felix
potvin
but
he
never
said
whose
it
was
actually
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
that
it
was
potvins
for
certain
i
would
bet
money
on
it
either
wayand
it
did
look
awesome
