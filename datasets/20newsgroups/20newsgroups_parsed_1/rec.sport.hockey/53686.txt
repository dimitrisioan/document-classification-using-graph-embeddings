playoff
pool
rules
entry
form
well
the
tentative
rules
anyway
and
of
course
since
the
season
is
not
entirely
over
tentative
entry
form
but
who
cares
the
real
hockey
season
is
starting
heres
the
deal
you
email
preferably
or
post
your
predictions
and
the
number
of
games
you
think
each
series
will
go
each
round
will
be
weighted
so
that
the
stanley
cup
finals
will
be
very
important
but
the
early
rounds
will
still
be
important
here
is
the
scoring
pick
st
round
winner
way
off
on

pick

ot

these
last
two
are
sympathy
points
probably
wont
happen
anyway
obviously
picking
the
stanley
cup
champion
is
important
i
will
do
some
tests
to
see
if
the
format
is
fair
but
probably
i
will
be
too
lazy
to
modify
it
so
the
scoring
will
probably
be
like
this
as
for
entry
forms
well
this
post
is
getting
too
long
so
see
next
post

opinion

you
