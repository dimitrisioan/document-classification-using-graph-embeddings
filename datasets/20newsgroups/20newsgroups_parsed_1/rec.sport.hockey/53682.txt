are

doubters

well

chelios
the
norris
if
you
asked
me
days
ago
id
agree
with
you
i
now
give
the
nod
to
raymond
bourque
his
play
took
off
the
same
time
the
bs
did
chelios
gets
a
close
second
how
about
kevin
hatcher
scored
roughly
goals
plays
minutes
a
game
dunno
who
wins
the
vezina
but
i
suspect
not
potvin
barrasso
finally
gets
his
due
in
a
close
one
over
eddie
the
eagle
thats
really
sad
when
two
secondrate
goalies
barasso
and
belfour
are
the
main
contenders
for
the
vezina
call
me
crazy
but
how
about
tommy
soderstrom
five
shutouts
for
a
th
place
team
that
doesnt
really
play
defense
its
really
unfortunate
that
the
better
goalies
in
the
league
mclean
essensa
vernon
had
unspectacular
years
btw
if
you
are
going
to
award
the
norris
on
the
basis
of
the
last
days
why
not
give
the
vezina
to
moog
he
has
been
the
best
goalie
over
the
past
month
coach
of
the
year
is
tricky
burns
did
the
most
with
the
least
raw
talent
king
did
a
good
job
but
the
flames
clearly
underachieved
last
year
brian
sutter
has
done
exceptionally
well
in
his
first
year
with
a
new
team
ditto
demers
page
has
been
blessed
by
the
ripening
and
acquisition
of
young
talent
darryl
sutter
is
having
a
good
year
for
a
rookie
coach
berry
made
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
terry
crisp
worked
minor
miracles
and
bowman
was
bowman
id
pick
burns
but
im
mildly
biased
in
your
case
that
bias
is
acceptable
mine
shows
with
the
norris
pick
so
were
even
im
impressed
with
what
all
the
coaches
you
mentioned
did
but
my
pick
would
be
al
arbour
not
too
many
folks
thought
the
isles
would
be
in
the
playoffs
let
alone
contend
for
rd
in
their
division
granted
that
they
did
have
a
little
help
from
their
cousins
on
broadway
and
i
like
the
islanders
about
as
much
as
i
like
mowing
my
lawn
arbour
or
king
burns
will
probably
win
since
playoffs
arent
taken
into
consideration
hes
ok
in
the
regular
season
but
im
not
sure
if
hes
beaten
anyone
other
than
hartford
in
the
playoffs
vlad
the
impaler
