well
its
not
that
bad
but
i
am
still
pretty
pissed
of
at
the
local
abc
coverage
they
cut
off
the
first
half
hour
of
coverage
by
playing
stuff
deleted
ok
heres
the
solution
to
your
problem
move
to
canada
yesterday
i
was
able
to
watch
four
gamesthe
njpitt
at
on
abc
lacal
at
cbc
buffbos
at
tsn
and
fox
and
monque
at
cbc
i
think
that
if
each
series
goes
its
max
i
could
be
watching
hockey
playoffs
for
some
odd
consecutive
nights
i
havent
counted
so
thats
a
pure
guess
i
have
two
tvs
in
my
house
and
i
set
them
up
sidebyside
to
watch
monque
and
keep
an
eye
on
bosbuff
at
the
same
time
i
did
the
same
for
the
two
afternoon
games
btw
those
abc
commentaters
were
great
i
was
quite
impressed
they
seemed
to
know
that
their
audience
wasnt
likely
to
be
wellschooled
in
hockey
lore
and
they
did
an
excellent
job
they
were
quite
impartial
also
imo
not
suffering
from
a
shortage
of
hockey
here
