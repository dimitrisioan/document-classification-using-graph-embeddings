habs
fan
living
with
die
hard
leafs
fans
speaking
of
die
hard
thats
what
i
did
when
i
read
this
died
hard
laughing
toronto
to
the
cup
finals
first
of
all
has
anyone
on
the
planet
heard
of
the
team
from
detroit
al
morgani
or
however
you
spell
the
idiots
name
must
be
from
chicago
because
on
espn
he
said
its
not
even
closechicago
will
definatly
win
the
norris
division
in
the
playoffs
no
other
team
is
close
everyone
is
picking
chicago
i
dont
get
it
he
says
its
an
easy
choice
god
chicago
was
against
the
wings
and
they
won
the
division
by
a
point
or
two
followed
closely
by
toronto
who
is
also
a
good
team
as
for
the
leafs
beating
detroitdoubt
it
but
even
if
they
do
they
arent
going
to
get
by
chicago
if
even
more
amazingly
they
get
past
the
hawks
they
would
probably
face
vancouver
and
lose
as
for
the
habs
reaching
the
finals
forget
it
even
i
as
a
devoted
wings
fan
will
watch
the
penguins
easily
threepeat
as
cup
winners

stevens
and
barrasso
its
a
done
deal
sorry
detroit
wait
til
next
year
but
hey
these
were
pauls
picks
and
everyone
has
a
right
to
their
own
opinnions
but
the
leafs
to
the
finals
yeah
if
they
make
it
there
ill
walk
to
toronto

thats
a
mile
walk
