re
how
to
beat
pittsburgh
from
anna
matyas
now
if
we
could
just
clone
chelioss
personality
and
transplant
it
into
all
of
the
defensemen
on
the
islanders
capitals
and
devils
gerald
in
other
words
you
want
to
turn
them
all
into
assholes
so
they
will
spend
lots
of
time
in
the
penalty
box
and
get
lots
of
misconducts
and
this
comes
from
a
chelios
fan
yeah
and
also
be
second
in
the
team
in
scoring
and
play
about
minutes
a
game
and
play
on
the
power
play
and
kill
penalties
and
be
the
best
defenseman
in
the
league
id
take
a
whole
team
of
chelioses
if
i
could
that
way
when
one
got
a
penalty
the
others
could
kill
it
