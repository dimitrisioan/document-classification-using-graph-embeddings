writes
gee
what
a
coincidence
he
doesnt
share
my
views
perhaps
thats
why
his
name
is
not
on
the
list
to
accompany
the
letter
maybe
i
should
write
a
disclaimer
at
the
end
mr
bettman
nota
bene
roger
maynard
does
not
agree
with
this
letter
i
know
hed
be
so
worried
otherwise
you
wouldnt
have
to
put
my
name
at
the
bottom
if
you
simply
appended
a
standard
disclaimer
that
the
opinions
expressed
in
your
petition
in
no
way
claim
to
represent
the
views
of
either
recsporthockey
or
the
internet
as
a
whole
you
have
surely
seen
these
disclaimers
appended
to
the
postings
of
many
who
work
for
companies
and
post
on
the
net
the
disclaimers
clever
though
some
of
them
may
be
are
there
for
a
reason
cordially
as
always
so
many
morons
rm
and
so
little
time
