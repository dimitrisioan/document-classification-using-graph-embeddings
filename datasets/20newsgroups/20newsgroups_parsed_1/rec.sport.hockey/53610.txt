messier
was
not
invited
due
to
his
nagging
injuries
while
the
press
made
an
issue
of
it
and
attempted
to
link
it
to
the
rangers
internal
political
woes
mike
keenan
repeated
that
to
messier
personally
during
the
msg
press
conference
it
makes
sense
messier
would
probably
have
not
declined
the
invitation
if
it
were
made
for
publicity
