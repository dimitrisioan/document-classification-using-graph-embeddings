writes
as
a
person
who
has
rarely
even
seen
don
cherry
and
doesnt
know
anything
about
him
i
dont
know
whether
it
is
just
this
area
pittsburgh
of
the
usa
that
is
deprived
of
his
broadcasts
or
whether
hes
a
canadian
thing
altogether
seriously
what
is
he
all
about
i
know
he
was
a
coach
at
one
time
and
from
the
volume
of
posts
about
him
someone
surely
is
getting
a
steady
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
read
about
on
the
net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
got
ta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
for
those
of
you
who
complain
about
don
cherry
and
wonder
why
he
is
popular
the
reply
is
dick
vitale
and
john
madden
and
bobby
knight
and
joe
garagiola
and
howard
cosell
john
madden
picks
gary
clark
of
the
redskins
for
his
allmadden
team
a
lot
over
much
better
receiversfor
much
the
same
reasons
cherry
sings
the
praises
of
doug
gilmoura
little
guy
with
heartyet
one
doesnt
see
a
string
of
american
posts
saying
that
john
madden
has
lost
his
marbles
dick
vitale
is
always
promoting
this
kid
from
this
high
school
or
that
college
with
outrageous
statements
why
should
americans
expect
that
canada
would
not
have
such
characters
in
relation
to
our
greatest
passionwhich
is
hockey
canadians
are
very
similar
to
americansculturally
our
sports
are
just
hockey
and
curling
whereas
with
americans
it
is
footballbasketballbaseball
and
bowling
gerald
id
like
to
add
that
i
think
canadian
hockey
fans
like
don
because
his
kind
of
hockey
the
hockey
he
promotes
in
his
tv
appearances
is
the
kind
that
they
think
used
to
get
played
in
the
old
team
nhl
so
theres
a
kind
of
nostagia
for
the
old
days
before
expansion
the
soviet
series
gretzky
and
even
bobby
orr
when
guys
werent
afraid
to
take
a
hit
nobody
floated
and
defensemen
played
defence
who
cares
that
that
probably
never
really
existed
the
myth
is
still
around
in
canada
and
all
the
european
in
fluence
on
the
game
has
diminished
it
in
some
peoples
eyes
personally
id
like
to
add
before
i
get
flamed
i
love
the
fastpaced
european
game
and
think
don
cherry
is
a
bit
of
an
idiot
i
have
to
say
that
i
missed
him
when
i
was
living
in
the
states
though
he
is
entertaining
even
if
you
end
up
throwing
your
popcorn
at
the
screen
when
hes
on
i
stand
by
all
the
misstatements
that
ive
made
vice
president
dan
quayle
to
sam
donaldson
me
too
