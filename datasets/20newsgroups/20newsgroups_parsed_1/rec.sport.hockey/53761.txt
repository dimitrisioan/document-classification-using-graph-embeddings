i
think
that
jack
ferreiras
firing
eventually
led
to
kingstons
firing
you
mention
consistency
of
vision
i
think
the
sharks
lost
that
with
the
loss
of
ferreira
there
has
never
been
a
headed
gm
that
has
ever
worked
you
need
one
person
making
the
personnel
decisions
at
the
top
not
management
by
committee
the
conventional
wisdom
from
around
the
league
is
that
ferreira
would
have
made
the
moves
that
would
have
fielded
a
better
product
on
the
ice
how
exactly
would
ferreira
accomplished
this
the
threeheaded
gmship
has
taken
a
lot
of
heat
but
nobodys
explained
how
things
would
have
been
any
different
had
ferreira
still
been
there
would
ferreira
have
made
more
trades
who
would
have
he
had
traded
would
he
have
made
fewer
trades
who
should
not
have
been
traded
