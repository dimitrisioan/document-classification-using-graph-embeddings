i
cant
believe
that
espn
is
making
sportschannel
america
look
good
but
only
in
nynj
philadelphia
and
chicago
everywhere
else
the
only
reason
sportschannel
was
available
was
for
local
baseball
broadcasts
yes
a
point
welltaken
however
even
in
areas
that
finally
got
some
games
theres
something
nagging
in
the
back
of
your
skull
when
the
network
that
has
the
national
rights
in
its
pocket
says
on
its
sports
news
theres
an
awesome
overtime
going
on
in
quebec
city
and
well
try
to
get
you
an
update
through
the
show
when
you
know
that
its
on
a
satellites
feedhorn
somewhere
up
there
listen
guys
you
can
talk
about
this
the
whole
playoffs
im
here
in
a
small
town
in
southern
illinois
at
school
im
from
canada
and
i
know
that
cbc
and
tsn
have
games
on
every
night
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
to
a
bar
with
a
satellite
i
have
watched
both
games
between
mon
que
and
toronto
and
detroit
not
to
mention
van
vs
winn
and
with
cbc
they
