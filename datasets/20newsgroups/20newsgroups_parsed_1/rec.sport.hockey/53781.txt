apparently
part
defensemen
numbered
through
was
lost
when
i
posted
it
to
make
things
worse
i
lost
my
own
copy
i
have
asked
on
the
sharks
mailing
list
on
which
it
did
get
out
to
see
if
someone
can
mail
me
a
copy
back

responds
i

sorry
about
that
larry
depalma
season
rd
acquired
free
agent
from
minnesota
grade
i
cd
no
netterfan
watching
the
sharks
including
me
knows
where
depalma
was
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
sharks
appeared
to
still
have
his
rights
but
he
wasnt
in
san
jose
he
wasnt
in
kansas
city
and
his
name
hasnt
appeared
on
the
waiver
wire
and
that
kind
of
invisibility
was
prevalent
for
the
most
part
for
depalma
after
being
called
up
october
against
the
tampa
bay
lightning
depalma
had
an
excellent
week
scoring
points
in
games
while
playing
good
defense
unfortunately
the
yearold
depalma
then
disappeared
the
rest
of
the
way
getting
just
more
points
in
more
games
and
generally
looked
lethargic
and
uninterested
on
both
ends
of
the
ice
he
then
was
sent
down
to
kansas
city
walked
out
from
there
and
was
suspended
and
later
reinstated
when
it
was
revealed
that
he
was
injured
he
then
promptly
disappeared
from
the
watching
eyes
of
shark
bytes
as
the
mailing
list
is
now
known
to
sharks
officials
faithful
and
neither
the
sharks
nor
we
miss
him
johan
garpenlov
season
rd
acquired
trade
with
detroit
for
d
bob
mcgill
and
th
round
pick
in
entry
draft
from
vancouver
grade
aa
after
an
early
slump
garpenlov
was
nothing
short
of
inspirational
the
rest
of
the
way
finishing
with
points
in
games
second
highest
total
on
the
team
as
he
clicked
well
with
team
mvp
kelly
kisio
and
right
wing
rob
gaudreau
kisio
got
most
of
the
credit
but
garpenlov
finishing
second
in
the
mvp
voting
clearly
demonstrated
his
playmaking
and
scoring
skills
as
he
was
seen
making
excellent
centering
passes
as
well
as
finishing
passes
to
him
by
putting
the
puck
past
opposing
goaltenders
getting
a
clubhigh
power
play
goals
contrary
to
his
previous
rep
garpenlov
also
showed
that
despite
his
small
size
lbs
he
was
willing
to
throw
himself
around
when
necessary
albeit
not
very
successful
yet
he
also
still
needs
to
work
on
his
defense
although
he
improved
tremendously
throughout
the
season
and
was
actually
quite
a
good
penalty
killer
by
the
end
of
the
season
he
will
be
a
major
key
to
the
offense
next
year
david
bruce
season
th
acquired
from
st
louis
in
expansion
draft
grade
i
after
a
banner
when
he
led
the
team
in
powerplay
goals
and
was
third
in
total
scoring
points
in
games
bruce
was
bothered
virtually
all
of
this
season
with
a
groin
injury
which
kept
him
out
of
the
lineup
for
all
by
games
this
season
of
course
it
is
difficult
to
speculate
how
well
he
would
have
done
this
season
had
he
not
been
affected
by
the
injury
but
the
yearold
bruce
was
effective
with
a
man
up
or
a
man
short
in
the
sharks
first
season
and
was
expected
to
be
a
strong
offensive
leader
this
season
as
well
the
injury
appears
serious
which
is
a
shame
because
otherwise
he
may
have
a
much
brighter
future
for
now
instead
his
future
with
the
sharks
next
season
appears
clouded
mark
pederson
season
rd
acquired
trade
with
philadelphia
for
clw
dave
snuggerud
grade
i
b
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
the
flyers
decision
to
unload
pederson
after
a
very
good
offensive
season
last
season
points
in
games
but
after
riding
the
pine
early
in
the
season
pederson
was
summarily
sent
to
the
sharks
in
exchange
of
the
defensiveminded
snuggerud
and
he
finished
with
games
combined
with
the
flyers
and
the
sharks
he
was
also
limited
by
injuries
this
season
and
this
limited
his
production
points
but
when
healthy
pederson
appears
impressive
with
a
good
scoring
touch
good
size
and
the
willingness
to
throw
it
around
although
hes
not
considered
a
physical
forward
and
good
speed
he
also
does
not
appear
to
be
a
liability
on
defense
but
the
sharks
probably
have
to
wait
until
next
season
to
see
how
much
exactly
pederson
can
do
john
carter
season
th
acquired
free
agent
from
boston
grade
i
bb
carter
was
definitely
one
of
the
hardest
workers
on
the
team
and
the
hard
work
worked
wonders
as
at
times
he
looked
great
on
ice
however
although
he
did
look
great
at
times
the
fact
that
he
received
just
points
in
games
for
his
efforts
is
a
sign
that
there
is
only
so
much
his
hard
work
can
do
and
the
sharks
confirmed
that
by
sending
him
to
kansas
city
with
about
games
left
in
the
season
carter
who
will
turn
on
may
always
hussled
but
as
a
result
was
sometimes
trapped
too
deep
within
the
offensive
zone
while
forechecking
but
he
was
generally
a
credit
on
the
defensive
end
but
he
is
probably
of
limited
utility
in
that
capacity
and
he
did
not
impress
offensively
although
he
was
one
of
the
best
sharks
at
drawing
penalties
he
is
very
unlikely
to
be
back
next
season
jeanfrancois
quintin
season
st
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
bb
i
dont
understand
why
the
sharks
didnt
let
quintin
play
any
more
than
the
games
he
played
this
season
he
was
generally
hardworking
and
creating
opportunities
offensively
and
appeared
at
age
ready
for
regular
nhl
duty
at
least
for
a
team
like
the
sharks
finishing
with
points
in
those
games
while
not
being
a
defensive
liability
shoulder
injury
in
training
camp
before
the
season
limited
quintin
the
teams
leading
scorer
in
exhibition
games
despite
sitting
out
the
final
two
to
just
games
with
the
sharks
and
the
blades
that
season
but
he
looked
impressive
he
should
be
a
solid
contender
for
regular
duty
next
season
mark
beaufait
season
st
acquired
nd
round
pick
in
supplemental
draft
grade
i
after
a
allstar
season
at
kansas
city
beaufait
got
a
cup
of
coffey
with
the
sharks
late
in
the
season
when
the
blades
knocked
down
a
playoff
spot
and
the
sharks
decimated
with
injuries
playing
games
and
scoring
a
goal
for
his
only
nhl
point
thus
far
despite
small
size
lbs
beaufait
was
not
shy
to
throw
himself
around
when
necessary
and
looked
pretty
good
at
times
although
its
too
early
to
judge
him
based
on
nhl
games
in
which
he
played
mostly
left
wing
away
from
his
center
position
at
northern
michigan
and
kansas
city
jaroslav
otevrel
season
st
acquired
th
round
pick
in
entry
draft
grade
i
like
beaufait
otevrel
also
played
away
from
his
normal
position
when
he
was
up
for
his
cup
of
tea
games
midway
through
the
season
he
was
generally
very
much
of
a
defensive
liability
and
did
not
show
much
offensively
either
although
that
may
be
more
indicative
of
the
lack
of
ice
time
he
got
in
those
games
he
may
need
another
season
to
work
on
his
defense
but
once
his
defense
is
acceptable
he
should
be
ready
michel
picard
season
st
acquired
trade
with
hartford
for
lw
yvon
corriveau
grade
i
bc
the
yearold
picard
although
he
perennially
tore
up
the
minors
seems
to
be
close
to
being
out
of
chances
for
some
reason
after
being
acquired
by
the
sharks
but
failing
to
impress
the
management
in
games
scoring
goals
for
his
only
points
and
he
spent
most
of
the
rest
of
the
way
in
kansas
city
he
was
not
particularly
strong
defensively
and
despite
his
offensive
brilliance
in
the
minors
he
has
failed
thus
far
to
score
in
the
nhl
although
he
has
been
given
limited
opportunities
he
may
be
the
sharks
bait
in
the
expansion
draft
dody
wood
season
st
acquired
rd
round
pick
in

draft
grade
i
dd
although
perhaps
i
shouldnt
give
a
grade
at
all
i
have
been
accused
of
knocking
on
wood
too
much
then
it
is
probably
no
surprise
to
you
that
i
am
thoroughly
unimpressed
by
wood
thus
far
although
games
is
a
small
example
he
was
generally
a
nonfactor
on
offense
was
not
particularly
good
defensively
and
took
too
many
silly
penalties
losing
many
fights
in
the
process
and
gathering
penalty
minutes
in
those
games
projecting
to
to
in
an
game
season
hes
not
ready
and
needs
at
least
another
season
at
kc
where
he
can
work
on
his
fighting
skills
if
nothing
else
his
relatively
small
size
lbs
does
not
give
much
possibility
that
he
can
survive
at
this
stage
