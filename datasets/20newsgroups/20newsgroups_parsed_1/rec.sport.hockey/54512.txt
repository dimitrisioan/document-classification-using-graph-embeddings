small
chance
of
reaching
the
quarterfinals
if

tonight
the
swiss

as
howald
was
allowed
to
skate
in
between
the
swedish
d
and
put
the
puck
past
tommy
to
make
it
was
a
nice
one

the
swedish

on
the
breaks

year
second
period
saw
a
new
swedish
team
and
the
swiss
had
to
ice

times
on
a
pp
nylander

in
from
the
boards
pavoni

then
a
power
play
goal
from
the
swiss
a
slap
shot
from
the
blue
line
hit
two
players
on
the
way

russia
probably
made
their
best
game
of
the
tourney
but
yet
there
wasnt
enough
to
win
against
the
effective
canadians
galley
took
a
slap
shot
that
found
dineen
by
the
far
post
and
dineen
just
deflected
the
puck
past
trefilov
in
the
russian
goal
then
a
power
play
goal
after
a
couple
of
deflections
eric
lindros
found
kariya
alone
by
the
far
post
and
kariya
put
the
puck
high
over
a
sliding
trefilov
russia
won
the
shots
in
the
first
period
and
they
had
the
most
of
the
scoring
opportunities
but
they
just
couldnt
score
second
period
saw
lindros
scoring
his
th
goal
of
the
wc
kariya
entered
the
russian
zone
slammed
on
the
break
to
get
past
his
defenseman
then
made
a
nice
pass
to
corson
who
just
got
the
stick
on
the
puck
to
deflect
it
to
lindros
who
onetimed
the
puck
the
russians
then
finally
got
their
goal
karpov
broke
in
from
the
side
and
made
a
slap
shot
in
tugnutts
top
right
hand
corner
player
of
the
game
in
canada
was
voted
paul
kariya
and
for
russia
valeri
karpov
i
agree
the
difference
in
this
game
was
lindros
and
kariya
and
in
part
also
tugnutt
kariya
had
a
far
better
game
now
than
vs
the
swedes
and
he
was
very
impressive
kariya
got
the
place
in
the
line
with
lindros
after
mike
gartner
went
out
with
a
ribinjury
early
in
the
first
period
lindros
btw
lead
the
point
scoring
with
pts
before
this
game
pts
ahead
of
the
next
player
ie
double
as
much
as
the
next
player
among
those
kariya
with
amazing
