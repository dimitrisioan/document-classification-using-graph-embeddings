re
if
oilers
go
to
hamilton
in
article
tom
moffat
says
if
the
oilers
move
to
hamilton
what
division
will
they
play
in
and
wont
they
have
to
change
their
name
to
the
steelers
or
something
the
only
significant
deposits
of
oil
around
hamilton
are
those
caused
by
the
tire
fire
a
few
years
back
then
again
if
the
nba
can
have
the
utah
jazz
or
the
la
lakers
think
about
it
what
lakes
are
in
la
then
i
guess
the
nhl
can
have
the
hamilton
oilers
