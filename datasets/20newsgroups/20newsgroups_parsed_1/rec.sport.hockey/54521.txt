john

picks
gary
clark
of
the
redskins
for
his
allmadden
team
a
lot
over
much
better
receiversfor
much
the
same
reasons
cherry
sings
the
praises
of
doug
gilmoura
little
guy
with
heartyet
one
doesnt
see
a
string
of
american
posts
saying
that
john
madden
has
lost
his
marbles
maybe
because
john
madden
doesnt
pretend
that
his
allmadden
team
is
the
team
of
the
best
players
maybe
because
john
madden
doesnt
feel
the
need
to
denigrate
players
he
doesnt
choose
for
his
allmadden
team
maybe
because
madden
actually
demonstrates
some
knowledge
about
football
when
he
broadcasts
a
game
don
cherry
doesnt
denigrate
players
except
those
who
dive
showboat
wield
their
sticks
as
weapons
while
hiding
behind
visors
or
deliberating
attempt
to
injure
or
aggravate
the
injuries
of
others
not
always
true
in
fact
in
the
case
of
doug
gilmour
he
actually
praises
them
europeans
that
do
those
things
are
scum
in
cherrys
opinion
canadian
kids
that
do
them
are
tough
just
like
a
real
canadian
ulf
samuelsson
cheap
shots
mark
messiers
ribs
and
don
wants
ulfs
head
doug
gilmour
breaks
tomas
sandstroms
arm
and
don
says
sandstrom
had
it
coming
methinks
don
is
either
very
confused
or
just
a
bigot
most
likely
the
latter
i
used
to
like
don
cherry
i
thought
he
was
great
but
im
starting
to
see
his
true
colors
redneck
and
the
more
i
see
of
them
the
more
i
think
hes
just
an
asshole
