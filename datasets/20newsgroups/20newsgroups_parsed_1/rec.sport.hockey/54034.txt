while
watching
the
penguinsdevils
game
last
night
i
saw
the
slash
that
barrasso
took
on
the
neck
this
brought
to
mind
the
goaltender
who
had
his
jugular
vein
cut
by
a
skate
i
think
he
was
a
sabre
but
im
not
positive
does
anyone
rememberknow
his
name
what
has
happened
to
him
since
what
about
the
player
whose
skate
cut
the
goalie
name
info
has
this
ever
happened
before
in
a
hockey
game
thanks

go
pens
i
remember
reading
an
article
in
readers
digest
many
moons
ago
about
a
similar
incident
during
a
minor
leaque
game
a
player
neck
was
cut
when
the
opponent
he
was
backchecking
tripped
and
his
skakes
flew
up
in
this
case
the
victims
mask
proved
a
hinderance
since
his
face
was
protected
and
so
he
didnt
bother
with
the
usually
instinctive
reaction
to
protect
his
faceneck
a
quick
thinking
coach
saved
his
life
by
applying
direct
pressure
and
using
snow
to
contract
the
blood
vessels
from
what
i

remember
