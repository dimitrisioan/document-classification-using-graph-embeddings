heres
one
from
the
mill
the
oilers
might
move
to
hamilton
where
porklington
can
get
a
free
deal
given
what
labour
relations
and
puck
has
been
like
it
would
be
a
sigh
of
relief
this
way
we
can
can
both
elements
well
dave
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
you
there
satan
himself
could
own
the
team
and
id
be
happy
as
long
as
the
oilers
stayed
in
edmonton
selfish
but
true
i
dont
want
to
see
the
oilers
move
no
matter
who
their
owner
is
bart
or
i
too
am
of
the
same
sentiment
bart
but
realistically
this
town
doesnt
want
to
pay
for
quality
player
and
hence
we
are
loosing
these
people
left
right
and
center
labour
is
also
responsible
for
their
boycott
pocklington
movement
i
would
like
the
oilers
to
stay
but
realistically
given
this
situation
its
byebye
oilers
