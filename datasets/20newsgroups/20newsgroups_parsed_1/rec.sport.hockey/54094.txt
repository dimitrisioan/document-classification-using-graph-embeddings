new
div
ncaa
teams
it
was
great
to
hear
that
umass
is
bringing
back
hockey
it
reminded
me
that
a
couple
of
years
ago
there
was
talk
that
both
bimidgi
sp
and
mankato
state
trying
to
upgrade
their
programs
to
div
status
i
also
seem
to
remember
that
they
had
some
trouble
with
new
ncaa
rule
about
just
who
was
allowed
to
compete
at
the
div
level
was
that
ever
resolved
also
i
was
just
wondering
if
there
is
any
college
hockey
east
of
colorado
alaska
excepted
with
the
new
popularity
of
hockey
on
the
west
coast
i
would
expect
there
to
be
some
interest
building
at
the
collegiate
levels
too
anyone
heard
anything
