sharks
review
part
goaltenders
as
the
sharks
season
came
to
a
close
tonight
i
will
start
a
series
of
posts
trying
to
revisit
the
players
the
trades
the
moves
etc
that
went
through
for
the
sharks
for
the
past
season
if
you
are
uninterested
since
i
will
have
the
words
sharks
review
in
the
subject
heading
in
these
postings
you
can
kill
them
i
will
first
try
to
evaluate
how
the
players
did
these
ratings
of
course
are
subject
to
my
own
biases
but
i
hope
that
i
can
try
to
be
as
objective
as
possible
i
will
evalute
players
who
finished
the
season
with
the
sharks
andor
did
not
play
for
another
nhl
team
this
season
thus
then
lets
go
to
the
goaltenders
brian
hayward
season
th
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
p
d
it
is
sad
that
his
career
has
to
come
to
this
dim
an
end
a
career
that
featured
sharing
three
jennings
trophies
with
patrick
roy
in
and
it
would
indeed
be
unfair
for
me
to
do
anything
but
give
him
a
passing
grade
and
skip
the
letter
grading
but
he
had
simply
been
awful
on
ice
this
year
save
for
a
bright
spot
or
two
and
even
if
he
had
been
healthy
he
would
not
be
any
more
than
the
rdstring
goalie
but
hayward
was
a
classy
individual
who
also
figured
in
on
the
sharks
first
ever
victory
the
rd
game
of
the
season
last
year
against
the
calgary
flames
as
he
retires
the
fans
will
remember
what
a
good
guy
he
was
jeff
hackett
season
rd
acquired
from
n
y
islanders
in
expansion
draft
grade
c
hackett
after
deservedly
winning
the
team
mvp
honors
last
season
simply
wasted
the
year
other
than
a
few
good
spots
saves
against
los
angeles
almostshutout
against
tampa
bay
etc
hackett
finishing
with
save
percentage
and
a
gaa
watched
his
status
go
from
the
teams
goalie
to
bench
decoration
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
was
expected
early
to
carry
the
team
along
instead
he
apparently
became
frustrated
but
the
an
early
injury
that
forced
him
to
miss
games
may
have
been
a
contributing
factor
but
upon
return
he
simply
wasnt
up
to
the
task
he
may
not
return
next
year
wade
flaherty
season
st
still
eligible
as
rookie
acquired
signed
as
undrafted
free
agent
grade
i
a
it
is
pretty
hard
to
evaluate
a
goaltender
on
just
one
game
alone
thus
the
incomplete
grade
but
yet
in
the
one
start
that
he
did
get
against
the
calgary
flames
flaherty
was
nothing
but
sharp
for
at
least
two
periods
he
started
the
season
poorly
in
kansas
city
but
finished
strong
prompting
the
blades
owner
ron
parker
to
comment
that
he
should
be
a
candidate
for
the
ihl
mvp
honors
the
upcoming
ihl
playoffs
would
be
a
major
challenge
for
him
as
he
tries
to
make
it
into
the
nhl
last
year
he
was
a
capable
backup
for
arturs
irbe
in
the
throughout
the
season
and
in
the
turner
cup
playoffs
picking
up
allstar
honors
along
with
irbe
now
its
time
for
him
to
show
that
he
can
share
the
job
with
irbe
next
year
because
with
prospects
dan
ryder
trevor
robins
and
scott
cashman
coming
along
if
he
doesnt
make
it
next
year
he
may
not
ever
arturs
irbe
season
st
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
b
i
may
yet
be
overly
critical
of
irbe
in
a
year
that
he
clearly
established
that
hes
a
bona
fide
nhl
goaltender
perhaps
a
bona
fide
goaltender
he
has
provided
most
of
the
little
highlight
footage
that
the
sharks
team
had
getting
the
teams
first
ever
shutout
against
the
los
angeles
kings
on
december
he
has
been
fearless
in
and
out
of
the
net
aggressively
playing
the
puck
and
making
passes
reminding
people
of
a
young
ron
hextall
except
of
course
the
goonism
yet
he
still
needs
to
develop
more
consistency
which
is
hard
to
do
with
such
a
bad
defense
in
front
of
him
but
if
the
sharks
are
to
challenge
for
a
playoff
spot
next
season
irbes
the
key
as
he
demonstrated
in
being
named
as
a
star
of
the
