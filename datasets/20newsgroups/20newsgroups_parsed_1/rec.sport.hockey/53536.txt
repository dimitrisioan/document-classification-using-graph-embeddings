have
a
hard
time
selling

that
cant
play
it
on

hockey
is
pretty
much
a
sport
for
the
white
and
well
off

players
come
from
from
a

boondock
saskatchewan

when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
a
hockey
league
in
the
inner
city

insurance
alone
is
a
big
enough
barrier
the
inner
city
isnt
the
only
place
that
is
poor
i
think
the
biggest
barrier
to
hockey
in
the
inner
city
is
no
ice
to
play
