i
dont
understand
why
so
many
people
are
predicting
an
upset
against
pittsburgh
the
team
has
won
in
a
row
coming
into
the
playoffs
theyve
won
practically
every
game
that
theyve
really
wanted
to
win
all
year
including
critical
victories
against
the
caps
and
one
against
a
hot
bruins
team
at
the
gaahden
the
team
is
probably
at
its
peak
stronger
than
the
previous
stanley
cup
winners
i
mean
i
know
they
can
lose
but
it
would
be
a
large
upset
i
personally
think
teams
are
going
to
be
hard
pressed
to
win
or
games
in
any
series
against
the
pens
and
im
not
a
pittsburgh
fan
i
have
to
agree
here
as
i
heard
on
tsn
tonight
you
want
to
pick
someone
else
but
you
just
dont
see
how
you
can
and
im
a
bruins
fan
maybe
this
year
will
be
different
but
it
doesnt
look
good
time
will
tell
though
lots
more
