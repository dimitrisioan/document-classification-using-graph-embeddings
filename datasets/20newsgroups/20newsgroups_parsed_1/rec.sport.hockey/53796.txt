re
cbc
game
choices
was
la
on
cbc
in
a
previous
article
says
in
article
the
godfather
writes
cbc
had
a
great
chance
for
some
double
headers
torontodetroit
and
vancouverwinnipeg
but
today
they
said
that
the
east
gets
the
leafs
and
the
west
get
the
vancouver
game
i
thought
that
they
would
show
them
both
im
totally
pod
too
vancouverwinnipeg
is
great
westcoast
hockey
fastpaced
and
loads
of
talent
what
ive
seen
so
far
is
hardly
entertaining
with
the
exception
of
the
odd
shift
every
now
then
of
course
i
missed
calgaryla
pittsjersey
no
because
the
pinheads
at
cbc
figure
everyone
here
in
ontario
cares
for
the
leafs
the
maple
leafs
and
nothing
but
the
leafs
half
of
southern
ontario
is
people
who
moved
from
out
west
but
the
good
folks
in
toronto
couldnt
care
less
they
should
show
the
doubleheader
heck
the
second
game
would
have
two
canadian
teams
and
let
those
desperate
for
news
watch
the
national
on
newsworld
but
they
dont
why
because
canada
ends
at
windsor
doncha
know
grrrrr
amen
now
i
have
to
get
updates
every
mins
on
cnn
headline
news
for
crying
out
loud
thats
cheaper
than
what
i
do
phone
calls
there
must
be
a
better
system
one
ring
adams
to
linden
he
scores
two
rings
bure
rushes
up
the
ice
he
scores
etc
