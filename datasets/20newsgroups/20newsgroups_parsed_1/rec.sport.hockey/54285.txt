if
the
bruins
get
to
meet
pittsburgh
in
the
near
future
you
can
bet
neely
will
have
his
day
the
sight
of
watching
ulf
turtle
up
like
the
coward
he
is
is
worth
almost
as
much
as
a
stanley

how
much
do
you
watch
and
follow
hockey
the
pens
and
bruins
will
be
in
the
same
division
next
season
which
will
give
neeley
plenty
of
opportunity
to
whine
about
ulf
all
i
can
say
is
im
glad
that
you
are
satisfied
with
seeing
ulf
turtle
up
as
a
substitute
for
the
stanley
cup
because
thats
as
close
as
the
bruins
are
going
to
come
to
the
stanley
cup
for
a
while
