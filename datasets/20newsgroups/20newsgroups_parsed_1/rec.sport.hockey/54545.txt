playoff
consecutive
loss
record
with
the
recent
demise
of
the
chicago
blawkhawks
much
to
my
delight
i
noticed
their
game
playoff
losing
streak
to
the
pens
last
year
and
now
to
the
blues
and
i
am
wondering
what
the
nhl
record
for
consecutive
losses
is
if
there
even
is
one
im
pretty
sure
that
the
hawks
have
at
least
a
game
losing
streak
since
theyve
had
to
have
lost
a
series
since
their
last
championship
whenever
that
was
basically
i
need
something
else
to
rag
