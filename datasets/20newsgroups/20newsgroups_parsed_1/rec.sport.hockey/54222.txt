peter
ahola
season
nd
acquired
trade
with
pittsburgh
for
future
considerations
grade
i
b
it
is
way
too
early
to
tell
about
ahola
who
was
acquired
probably
because
the
penguins
figured
that
they
would
lose
him
in
the
expansion
draft
ahola
had
only
played
games
this
season
i
think
its
actually
less
the
san
jose
mercury
news
may
be
in
err
here
of
them
with
the
sharks
in
the
games
he
has
played
he
appeared
quite
solid
defensively
although
he
hasnt
been
spectacular
and
his
offense
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
points
its
even
possible
that
the
trade
may
be
for
future
considerations
which
turn
out
to
be
peter
ahola
doug
wilson
season
th
acquired
trade
with
chicago
for
rw
kerry
toporowski
and
nd
round
pick
in
entry
draft
grade
i
b
i
have
often
been
accused
of
overly
down
on
wilson
i
may
have
had
too
high
expectations
for
him
but
his
legs
knees
et
al
are
giving
out
nevertheless
when
he
was
playing
he
exhibited
a
strong
shooting
and
playmaking
abilities
even
if
he
has
lost
a
step
on
defense
which
unfortunately
he
demonstrated
this
year
as
well
as
at
times
he
was
slow
to
catch
the
opponent
forwards
and
his
offensive
output
was
only
good
enough
for
nd
place
on
the
team
points
in
games
but
next
year
which
may
be
wilsons
last
if
he
can
stay
healthy
he
can
still
be
a
contributor
dean
kolstad
season
nd
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
cd
its
probably
somewhat
unfair
for
me
to
judge
kolstad
on
just
a
handful
of
games
forgetting
exact
number
but
no
more
than
but
at
age
hes
quickly
running
out
of
time
if
he
wants
to
make
it
to
the
nhl
in
those
games
he
did
not
impress
anyone
after
generating
shots
in
the
first
period
of
the
first
game
he
played
he
scored
just
points
in
his
tenure
up
here
with
the
sharks
and
was
even
less
impressive
defensively
as
he
appeared
awkward
with
his
movement
and
was
prone
to
giveaways
he
needs
to
make
a
leap
in
his
level
of
performance
to
have
any
chance
of
making
the
team
pat
macleod
season
nd
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
macleod
was
on
the
roster
a
lot
longer
than
kolstad
but
it
appears
to
my
memory
that
he
played
less
than
kolstad
because
the
sharks
were
reluctant
to
use
him
but
were
even
more
reluctant
to
send
him
to
the
minors
figuring
that
he
wouldnt
clear
waivers
in
fact
he
has
played
the
past
weeks
with
kansas
city
but
is
still
technically
there
on
a
rehabilitation
assignment
a
rehab
assignment
that
will
include
him
playing
in
the
turner
cup
playoffs
since
he
has
played
so
little
i
cant
even
give
a
tentative
grade
on
him
but
he
demonstrated
last
year
excellent
offensive
skills
but
terrible
defensive
skills
tom
pederson
season
st
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
b
called
up
in
the
middle
of
the
season
when
the
defensive
corps
was
decimated
by
injuries
pederson
impressed
many
sharks
fan
here
on
net
including
yours
truly
he
demonstrated
very
good
offensive
skills
scoring
points
in
games
however
his
size
lbs
is
of
concern
and
soon
after
he
began
to
shine
offensive
did
teams
begin
to
push
him
around
physically
on
both
sides
of
the
ice
although
he
had
appeared
fearless
in
his
approach
but
to
be
successful
he
probably
needs
to
bulk
up
to
have
a
fighting
chance
on
surviving
against
some
of
the
bigger
players
in
the
league
claudio
scremin
season
st
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
dd
he
played
all
of
games
in
the
league
this
year
but
was
thoroughly
umimpressive
just
as
he
was
at
the
end
of
last
season
again
it
may
be
a
small
sample
but
just
as
in
the
case
of
kolstad
scremin
at
age
is
quickly
running
out
of
time
he
was
not
a
contributor
on
either
offense
or
defense
in
the
games
he
played
with
the
sharks
the
only
notable
thing
that
will
go
down
in
scremins
entry
of
league
stats
is
probably
the
fact
that
he
was
once
traded
for
