the
isles
picked
one
hellofatime
to
get
their
first
win
all
year
after
being
down
after
periods
the
caps
seemed
to
have
the
game
in
hand
playing
steady
defense
and
getting
great
goaltending
from
tabaracci
the
isles
power
play
philosophy
continues
to
be
dumpandchase
which
except
for
boardaholics
like
flatley
doesnt
work
against
the
caps
i
hope
al
realizes
this
they
have
too
many
talented
finesse
players
so
why
not
carry
the
puck
in
and
setup
if
last
nights
game
is
any
omen
the
isles
could
be
on
their
way
to
that
ole
championship
form
coming
from
behind
late
in
a
game
my
advice
to
the
caps
is
to
pounce
on
those
healy
rebounds
flatley
showed
alot
of
heart
by
playing
the
last
period
and
overtime
despite
an
almost
swollenshut
left
eye
injury
suffered
at
the
hands
of
dale
hunter
ray
ferraro
has
arrived
just
in
time
for
the
playoffs
showing
the
fiesty
hustle
that
us
islander
fans
remember
from
an
italian
from
the
past
john
tonelli
it
was
tonelli
who
won
a
similar
game
against
the
pens
in
game
on
the
playoffs
the
isles
scored
two
late
third
period
goals
to
send
the
game
into
ot
tied
at
in
ot
tonelli
scored
the
game
winner
to
send
the
isles
to
the
next
round
the
isles
have
lacked
this
tenacity
for
years
but
perhaps
its
back
it
was
good
to
see
the
coliseum
packed
just
like
the
ole
days
good
luck
to
the
isles
the
rest
of
the
way

the
