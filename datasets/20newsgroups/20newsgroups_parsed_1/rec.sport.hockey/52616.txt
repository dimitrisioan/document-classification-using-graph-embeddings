just
reported
that
the
ottawa
sun
has
reported
that
montreal
will
send
players
million
including
vin
damphousse
and
brian
bellows
to
phillidelphia
phillie
will
send
eric
lindros
to
ottawa
and
ottawa
will
give
its
first
round
pick
to
montreal
if
this
is
true
it
will
most
likely
depend
on
whether
or
not
ottawa
gets
to
choose
st
overall
can
ottawa
afford
lindros
salary
personally
i
cant
see
philli
giving
up
lindros
for
anything
they
didnt
give
away
that
much
to
quebec
just
to
trade
him
away
again
not
to
mention
that
lindros
seems
to
be
a
huge
draw
in
phillie
and
that
he
represents
a
successful
future
for
the
franchise
ottawa
may
be
better
off
taking
the
players
from
montreal
for
the
pick
stephen
legge
two
things
didnt
the
trade
deadline
pass
two
weeks
ago
the
flyers
would
never
ever
ever
give
up
lindros
simple
as
that
with
soderstrom
and
roussel
why
the
hell
would
the
flyers
want
to
pick
up
an
older
and

roy
byw
i
could
come
up
with
a
group
of
players
theyd
trade
