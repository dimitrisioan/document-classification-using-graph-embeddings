i
cant
believe
that
espn
is
making
sportschannel
america
look
good
but
only
in
nynj
philadelphia
and
chicago
everywhere
else
the
only
reason
sportschannel
was
available
was
for
local
baseball
broadcasts
yes
a
point
welltaken
however
even
in
areas
that
finally
got
some
games
theres
something
nagging
in
the
back
of
your
skull
when
the
network
that
has
the
national
rights
in
its
pocket
says
on
its
sports
news
theres
an
awesome
overtime
going
on
in
quebec
city
and
well
try
to
get
you
an
update
through
the
show
when
you
know
that
its
on
a
satellites
feedhorn
somewhere
up
there
if
people
want
hockey
on
tv
they
should
watch
hockey
on
tv
i
bet
the
ratings
for
hockey
on
sunday
on
abc
went
into
the
toilet
from
todays
times
abc
got
great
ratings
in
chicago
and
st
louis
a
and
the
kingsflames
got
a
on
the
west
coast
but
only
a
in
metro
new
york
ie
the
devils
squandered
their
newfound
support
from
a
year
ago
when
they
played
the
rangers
in
comparison
seniors
golf
did
better
next
week
there
will
be
far
fewer
abc
affiliates
with
hockey
i
fear
that
the
overall
national
numbers
will
not
be
so
great
i
cant
tell
if
abc
did
any
advance
marketing
or
not
cos
i
dont
watch
much
tv
the
nhl
should
have
made
sure
that
it
was
solid
on
cable
before
going
on
the
air
even
espn
couldve
sold
second
rights
to
third
party
systems
ie
nonsportschannel
since
they
are
not
making
any
extra
money
by
sitting
on
the
games
hockey
fans
will
not
necessarily
be
watching
preseason
beach
volleyball
if
playoffs
games
arent
being
shown
somewhere
