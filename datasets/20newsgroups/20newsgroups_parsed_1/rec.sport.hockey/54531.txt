behind
in

history
which
doesnt

much
since
the
statistics
are
mostly
based
on
the

playoff
format

yes
it
looks
dark
for
the
bs
what
a
disappointment
still
i
think
the
problem
is
mental
they
needed
the
saves
blue
came
up
with
perhaps
he
can
offer
something
to
mentally
rally
around
who
do
you
think
gets
the
start
in
game
three
i
hope
it
is
going
to
be
blue
if
the
team
can
rally
around
him
maybe
moog
can
too
