bruins
come
on
boston
where
the
hell
are
you
seven
wins
in
a
row
and
what
choke
id
much
rather
see
the
bruins
in
the
wales
conference
finals
vs
pitt
than
buffalo
or
quebec
if
only
because
it
would
be
more
interesting
not
that
buffalo
or
quebec
cant
put
up
a
good
fight
but
id
much
more
enjoy
a
pasteing
of
the
bruins
than
the
devils
you
have
to
feel
for
terrerrisp
ah
well
maybe
the
devils
will
pull
it
out
or
maybe
the
pens
will
lose
in
the
second
round
but
if
not
i
hope
the
bruins
are
there
to
meet
them
