divide
this
number
by
to
take
into
account
of
the
fact
that
there
are
players
on
the
ice
and
each
is
responsible
for
the
team
a
players
adjusted
is
his
raw
team
adjustment
btw
if
anyone
could
calculate
and
post
adjusted
ratings
it
would
be
greatly
appreciated
i
might
find
the
time
to
do
so
but
dont
count
on
it
i
have
a
database
filter
set
up
for
the
player
stats
when
it
is
posted
for
the
end
of
season
ill
repost
the
team
averages
you
dont
need
to
go
through
the
complicated
team
adjustment
you
are
using
all
you
need
is
the
team
average
by
summing
all
the
individual
players
and
divide
by
the
total
number
of
players
on
the
team
this
will
be
a
little
distorted
because
the
players
who
have
been
traded
recently
will
have
come
with
scores
based
on
their
original
teams
this
shouldnt
distort
it
too
bad
though
if
you
want
to
look
at
individual
players
from
this
perspective
then
go
ahead
youll
require
the
original
player
stats
though
question
if
a
team
uses
players
in
a
season
do
you
merely
divide
the
total
by
if
so
a
player
who
plays
in
only
game
is
considered
equally
valuable
as
a
player
who
plays
in
all
of
them
another
way
of
looking
at
the
same
thing
is
to
compare
the
deviation
from
the
mean
for
the
team
of
the
player
to
the
standard
deviation
for
the
team
ill
post
both
since
the
standard
deviation
for
each
team
is
different
i
am
unsure
how
transferable
between
teams
that
these
stats
are
shouldnt
the
average
standard
deviation
in
the
league
be
used
i
am
interested
in
seeing
each
method
but
i
still
think
that
mine
is
the
best
if
for
no
other
reason
than
familiarity
