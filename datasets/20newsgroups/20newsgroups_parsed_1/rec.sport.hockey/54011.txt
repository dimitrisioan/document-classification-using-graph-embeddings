shutout
the
hawks
the
blues
are
playing
like
they
did
in
clutch
n
grab
shoot
the
puck
out
its
incredibly
boring
to
watch
but
if
it
works
road
i
agree
its
very
boring
if
youre
not
a
blues
fan
but
the
blues
played
two
perfect
road
games
not
boring
is
right
it
is
more
likely
to
cause
me
to
have
a
stroke
i
had
to
listen
to
game
two
on
the
blackhawk
station
and
i
dont
think
i
could
take
another
call
of
and
joseph
makes
a
spectacular
saaaaaave
now
im
a
blues
fan
but
i
dont
want
them
to
play
like
they
played
in
game
two
sure
the
result
was
fine
but
the
blues
match
up
very
well
with
the
hawks
so
they
really
dont
need
to
treat
them
like
the
flames
we
dont
need
a
monday
night
miracle
to
have
a
chance
to
beat
chicago
the
blues
can
do
it
on
talent
at
least
over
the
hawks
