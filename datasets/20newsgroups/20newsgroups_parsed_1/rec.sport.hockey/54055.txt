re
devils
and
islanders
tiebreaker
according
to
the
hockey
gurus
over
at
espn
should
the
islanders
win
tonite
the
two
teams
will
have
the
same
record
but
the
devils
will
be
playing
the
penguins
this
is
because
the
islanders
have
won
the
season
series
against
the
devils
i
think
the
rules
for
deciding
a
tie
breaker
include
season
series
goals
against
goals
for
in
this
order
correct
me
if
im
wrong
anyone
have
anything
to
add
craig
go
islanders
