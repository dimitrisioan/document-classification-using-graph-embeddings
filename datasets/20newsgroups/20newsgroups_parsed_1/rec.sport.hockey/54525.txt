acquired
c
marcus
thuresson
from
n
y
islanders
for
rw
brian
mullen
grade
i
bc
it
is
not
known
yet
what
the
impact
overall
of
this
trade
would
be
as
thuresson
is
not
yet
under
contract
to
the
sharks
and
does
not
appear
to
be
ready
to
become
so
anytime
soon
mullen
meanwhile
has
had
a
productive
somewhat
season
with
the
islanders
thuresson
however
does
not
appear
to
be
a
big
scorer
at
all
if
my
memory
is
right
he
had
just
points
in
just
games
in
the
swedish
elite
league
in
this
season
i
didnt
notice
his
name
frequently
at
all
in
staffans
reports
and
he
didnt
make
the
national
team
either
it
does
not
appear
to
be
a
good
sign
marcus
thuresson
had
goals
assists
points
and
pim
in
games
this
season
for
leksand
in
the
swedish
elite
league
this
was
only
th
in
point
scoring
for
leksand
marcus
born
may
ht
cm
wt
kg
is
relatively
young
so
he
might
still
start
producing
but
i
think
the
sharks
may
have
done
a
bad
trade
here
