bill
ranford
stopped
shots
to
lead
canada
to
a
victory
in
a
very
well
played
game
the
first
period
started
with
a
give
away
from
a
canadian
defenseman
and
rundqvist
came
in
alone
on
ranford
but
couldnt
put
the
puck
over
a
sliding
ranford
later
on
kevin
dineen
had
a
great
opportunity
but
soderstrom
played
very
well
too
stefan
nilsson
had
a
couple
of
great
dekes
and
set
up
jan
larsson
but
again
ranford
came
up
big
period
ended
scoreless
but
the
edge
to
sweden
in
creating
more
opportunities
second
period
action
saw
tommy
soderstrom
making
a
great
save
mark
recchi
made
a
backhanded
cross
ice
pass
to
lindros
eric
one
timed
the
puck
but
soderstrom
was
there
to
make
a
glove
hand
save
at
the
minute
mark
canada
started
applying
pressure
on
the
swedes
sandersondineenbrindamour
worked
hard
and
kept
the
puck
in
the
swedes
zone
dineen
gave
the
puck
to
sanderson
who
skated
around
a
screened
swedish
defenseman
came
in
on
soderstrom
and
made
a
wrist
shot
that
went
it
by
soderstroms
far
post
canada
the
swedes
picked
up
their
game
after
that
and
peter
forsberg
had
a
shot
that
hit
ranfords
post
the
inside
went
parallel
to
the
goal
line
and
out
then
gartner
got
a
penalty
and
the
swedes
a
power
play
jan
larsson
took
a
shot
from
the
slot
ranford
gave
a
rebound
to
larsson
who
saw
juhlin
by
the
far
post
passed
the
puck
and
ranford
was
beat
third
period
started
as
the
other
periods
swedes
having
most
of
the
pressure
but
the
canadians
always
dangerous
once
they
were
close
to
the
swede
goal
at
canada
created
some
great
chances
and
arto
blomsten
was
forced
to
cover
the
puck
in
the
swede
goal
crease
since
soderstrom
lost
sight
of
it
that
resulted
in
a
penalty
shot
since
a
defenseman
cant
cover
the
puck
in
the
goal
crease
geoff
sanderson
took
the
penalty
shot
his
first
ever
he
explained
afterwards
and
he
put
it
low
on
soderstroms
stick
side
close
to
the
post
excellent
penalty
shot
to
give
canada
a
go
ahead
goal
canada
increased
the
lead
on
a
very
suspect
offside
gartner
volleyed
a
bouncing
puck
past
soderstrom
to
make
it
the
swedes
ran
out
of
gas
then
and
couldnt
produce
as
good
scoring
chances
as
they
had
for
periods
the
goal
came
with
only
second
left
rod
brindamour
scoring
on
a
rebound
from
soderstrom
where
the
swedish
defense
already
had
their
minds
in
the
dressing
room
a
very
good
game
the
best
in
the
wc
so
far
with
both
goalies
playing
great
soderstrom
best
player
in
sweden
but
ranford
even
played
better
than
soderstrom
that
tells
you
something
about
ranford
probably
the
best
goalie
in
the
world
were
some
comments
after
the
game
canada
played
a
very
disciplined
defense
ranford
pointed
out
that
it
is
easy
to
play
well
with
a
good
defense
lindros
played
a
lot
and
played
well
sanderson
naturally
game
hero
with
two
goals
the
forsbergnaslundbergqvist
line
swedens
best
along
with
larssonjuhlin
nilsson
swedish
defense
played
well
cm
kg
peter
popovic
had
the
task
of
neutralizing
cm
kg
eric
lindros
and
managed
this
very
well
ranger
defenseman
peter
andersson
finally
got
to
go
to
the
wc
and
considering
that
he
landed
in
germany
just
a
few
hours
before
the
game
he
played
very
well
swedish
coach
curt
lundmark
was
irritated
after
the
game
partly
because
of
the
swedes
inability
to
score
and
partly
because
of
the
linesmans
mistake
on
the
goal
lines

a

for

as
far
as
the

in

goes
the

seemed
to
have

a
