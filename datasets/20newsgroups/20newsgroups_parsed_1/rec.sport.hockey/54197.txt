so
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
parity
boston
never
was
is
not
now
and
never
will
be
as
good
an
organization
as
the
montreal
canadiens
never
was
probably
is
not
now
debatable
what
other
valid
test
can
you
think
of
besides
the
final
standings
or
divisional
playoff
winner
what
do
you
propose
a
worthless
vote
like
they
do
in
college
football
what
a
joke
you
boston
fans
make
me
laugh
youre
going
crazy
based
on
a
very
recent
boston
domination
over
montreal
in
the
playoffs
i
mean
how
many
cups
has
boston
won
compared
to
montreals
and
who
do
you
think
is
going
to
win
the
next
cup
between
the
teams
montreal
or
boston
you
know
sindens
going
to
find
some
way
of
screwing
up
even
this
good
boston
team
hell
fire
suter
or
trade
away
a
vital
star
admittedly
his
last
few
trades
have
been
good
ones
but
how
long
before
his
luck
runs
out
and
he
starts
making
espositofor
ratelle
type
trades
again
if
i
remember
right
brad
park
was
also
involved
in
that
trade
he
wasnt
all
that
bad
a
hockey
player
but
lets
look
at
some
of
sindens
trades
over
the
years
for
rick
middleton
rangers
i
dont
know
who
sinden
gave
up
for
middle
ton
so
ill
call
this
one
a
barry
pederson
for
cam
neely
canucks
any
questions
greg
hawgood
for
vladimir
ruzicka
oilers
didja
see
that
one
rosie
roofed
against
roy
in
last
years
playoffs
courtnallranford
for
andy
moog
oilers
a
wash
moog
is
a
good
goaltender
ranford
burned
boston
in
the
finals
in
his
first
year
and
courtnall
always
seems
to
get
his
points
anyone
in
vancouver
care
to
comment
on
courtnall
as
a
defensive
liability
ken
linseman
for
dave
poulin
flyers
any
more
questions
janneyquintal
for
adam
oates
blues
janney
is
an
enormous
talent
and
a
personable
guy
the
the
bruins
play
in
adams
division
enough
said
soeven
if
you
count
the
espositovadnaisratelleparki
dont
remember
who
else
joe
zanussi
trade
as
a
double
minus
harry
the
horse
trader
comes
out
on
top
i
submit
that
the
bruins
are
always
good
because
of
harry
not
in
spite
of
him
btw
do
you
really
think
the
habs
will
bounce
back
next
season
ill
bet
they
finish
fourth
or
fifth
in
the
conference
behind
any
of
the
following
pittsburgh
quebec
boston
washington
islanders
someone
correct
me
if
these
five
teams
will
not
be
in
montreals
conference
in
summary
things
look
bleak
for
the
habs
at
least
in
the
near
future
i
suspect
that
the
next
team
from
la
belle
province
to
win
the
cup
will
be
that
team
that
lindros
didnt
want
to
play
for
i
admit
that
ive
been
suffering
lately
with
the
boston
gets
hot
while
montreal
swans
in
the
playoffs
type
years
but
i
do
have
the
sure
knowledge
that
the
montreal
braintrust
will
keep
plugging
away
until
they
hit
the
right
formula
for
yet
another
cup
whereas
if
i
were
a
boston
fan
id
have
this
kind
of
despair
that
as
long
as
harry
sinden
is
running
the
show
the
bruins
will
always
be
good
but
never
good
enough
