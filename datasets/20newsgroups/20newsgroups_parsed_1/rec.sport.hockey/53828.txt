i
cant
believe
that
espn
is
making
sportschannel
america
look
good
but
only
in
nynj
philadelphia
and
chicago
everywhere
else
the
only
reason
sportschannel
was
available
was
for
local
baseball
broadcasts
and
local
baseball
preempted
the
nhl
playoffs
thus
far
into
this
playoff
season
espnabc
has
given
me
more
hockey
in
days
game
than
sportschannel
did
games
if
people
want
hockey
on
tv
they
should
watch
hockey
on
tv
i
bet
the
ratings
for
hockey
on
sunday
on
abc
went
into
the
toilet
next
week
there
will
be
far
fewer
abc
affiliates
with
hockey
someone
in
this
thread
said
that
he
wouldnt
watch
the
games
even
if
they
were
on
tv
and
this

xenophobes
north

neednt
fear
the
usamericanization
of
our
game
because
usamericans
will
never
figure
out
how
to
market
hockey
here
support
your
team
support
your
game
mike
eisler
not
only
are
they
leafs
the
best
team
but
their
fans
are
even
more
intelligent
and
insightful
than
pittsburghs
their
players
are
mighty
bright
too
i
mean
he
really
was
going
to
get
his
