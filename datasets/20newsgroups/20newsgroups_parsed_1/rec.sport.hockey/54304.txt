hey
i
am
in
iowa
and
i
do
not
mind
espn
showing
the
pittnjd
games
cyt
at
least
i
get
to
see
the
devilseven
if
they
are
gettin
there
ass
cyt
kicked
perhaps
they
will
score
and
even
win
a
game
or
two
cyt
go
devils
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
this
but
i
dont
think
the
devils
will
win
a
game
against
pittsburg
the
penguins
have
so
many
scoring
threats
that
you
shut
down
one
and
another
will
kill
you
its
too
bad
but
i
must
conclude
that
the
penguins
will
win
their
third
stanley
cup
in
a
row
i
hope
someone
will
beat
them
but
i
just
can
not
see
it
happening
