german
audience
is
lunatic
i
watched
the
game
germanyczechs
in
wc
todayand
i
was
astonished
about
the
behaviour
of
the
german
audience
the
german
team
got
a
few
penalties
in
the
last
period
and
the
crowd
went
grazy
they
threw
coins
extra
pucks
and
other
trash
into
the
rinkis
that
stupid
or
what
i
guess
the
canadian
referee
one
of
the
isostarbros
gave
the
german
team
a
penalty
for
that
but
it
didnt
help
much
i
guess
the
germans
just
are
proud
over
their
nazikillemalleveryone
butusgermanssucks
attitudethey
just
seem
to
have
that
kind
of
attitude
in
every
possible
sport
remember
the
european
champs
in
stockholm
in
soccer
it
really
pisses
me
off
i
do
not
mean
that
every
single
german
has
this
attitude
that
sucks
but
most
of
them
seem
to
do
jokke
