whats
going
on
the
russians
and
the
czechs
are
unable
to
beat
easy
opponents
and
the
swedes
beat
austria
only
its
the
openinggame
effect
maybe
pros
arrive
late
nervousness
for
rookie
wc
players
and
problems
to
get
the
lines
clicking
may
make
things
hard
to
get
it
going
against
these
worse
nations
id
guess
that
the
better
team
you
face
in
the
opening
game
the
better
it
is
since
the
chances
of
an
upset
are
greater
then
some
other
reasons
why
the
worse
teams
are
so
tough
to
beat
was
presented
by
hans
virus
lindberg
former
coach
in
switzerland
the
worse
teams
referring
to
france
switzerland
austria
italy
etc
have
now
usually
world
class
goalies
their
defensive
play
have
become
much
more
disciplined
they
take
much
less
unnecessary
penalties
they
use
four
lines
which
makes
it
harder
to
make
them
run
out
of
gas
the
ice
quality
in
the
german
wc
rinks
is
poor
the
only
convincing
winner
was
germany
wierd
another
weird
thing
was
that
the
czechs
played
entertaining
hockey
err
just
kidding
david
ps
alex

would
like
to
