flicked
the
penguins

briefly

i
am
wondering
if
don
cherry
is
going
to
go
off
on
this
at
all
in
coachs
corner
and
that
was
the
only
infraction
of
this
type
in
the
game
come

wake
up
geez
hes
not
the
only
player
who
does
this
sort
of
thing
i
think
we
were
kind
of
lucky
the
game
was
not
really
all
that
chippy
considering
the
state
nj
is
in
about
now
