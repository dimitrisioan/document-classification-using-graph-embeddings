bradley
center
in
milwaukee
is
home
to
the
milwaukee
admirals
minor
leauge
hockey
team
the
owner
of
the
admirals
sorry
i
cant
remember
his
name
either
owns
or
at
least
shelled
out
the
majority
of
the
funds
to
build
the
bradley
center
lloyd
pettit
married
into
allenbradley
corp
abcom
family
and
owns
the
admirals
he
donated
the
bradley
center
and
the
new
pettit
national
ice
center
supposedly
he
was
approached
by
the
nhl
about
an
expansion
franchise
but
turned
it
down
because
he
thought
the
franchise
fee
of
million
was
too
high
this
is
not
the
way
i
have
heard
it
see
lloyd
as
he
is
affectionately
referred
to
by
milwaukeeans
and
bob
uecker
bought
the
bradley
center
to
get
the
nhl
to
come
here
like
i
said
i
dont
know
whether
this
story
is
true
or
just
a
rumor
but
if
its
true
dont
look
for
an
nhl
team
in
milwaukee
anytime
soon
the
admirals
arent
going
to
be
forced
out
of
the
building
and
you
wont
see
an
nhl
club
and
a
minor
league
club
in
the
same
building
especially
since
the
nbas
milwaukee
bucks
play
there
as
well
yeah
the
bucks
the
milwaukee
wave
soccer
the
admirals
the
marquette
warriors
concerts
and
a
bunch
of
other
things
