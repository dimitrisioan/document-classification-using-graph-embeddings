weeks

i
read
in
the
toronto
sun
a
quote
from
alex
it
went
something
like
sarcastically
yep
pattys
the
man
hes
responsible
for
the
teams
successim
a
nobody
around
here
how
can
you
assume
it
was
a
sarcastic
remark
for
someone
whose
first
language
is
not
english
i
would
interpret
that
comment
to
mean
that
he
believes
pat
is
the
mvp
on
the
team
and
that
he
is
just
one
of
the
other
normal
players
quite
modest
i
might
say
well
i
dont
recall
assuming
anything
except
perhaps
that
the
columnist
who
reported
the
incident
was
telling
the
truth
ie
the
sarcastic
impression
came
from
him
steve
simmons
besides
to
my
knowledge
alex
has
a
pretty
fair
grasp
of
the
english
languageand
his
recent
comment
after
the
detroit
game
would
indicate
that
this
remark
is
what
i
think
it
to
be
very
low
