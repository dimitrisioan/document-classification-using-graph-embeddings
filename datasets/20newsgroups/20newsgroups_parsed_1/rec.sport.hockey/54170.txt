i
watched
the
game
germanyczechs
in
wc
todayand
i
was
astonished
about
the
behaviour
of
the
german
audience
the
german
team
got
a
few
penalties
in
the
last
period
and
the
crowd
went
it
was
not
just
those
penalties
most
of
all
it
was
the
penalty
the
referee
didnt
call
on
the
czechs
right
before
their
first
goal
grazy
they
threw
coins
extra
pucks
and
other
trash
into
the
rinkis
that
stupid
or
what
i
guess
the
canadian
referee
one
of
the
isostarbros
gave
the
german
team
a
penalty
for
that
but
it
didnt
help
much
i
guess
the
germans
just
are
proud
over
their
nazikillemalleveryone
dont
you
think
its
quite
silly
to
call
it
a
nazi
attitude
when
some
people
throw
coins
on
the
ice
hey
i
dont
approve
the
behavior
of
these
guys
especially
not
in
a
wc
game
but
i
cant
see
any
reason
for
using
the
word
nazi
in
this
connection
butusgermanssucks
attitudethey
just
seem
to
have
that
kind
of
attitude
in
every
possible
sport
remember
the
european
champs
in
stockholm
in
soccer
soccer
hooligans
are
not
just
a
german
problem
remember
the
world
cup
in
italy
again
theres
a
big
difference
between
throwing
coins
and
smashing
shopwindows
or
fighting
with
other
socalled
fans
who
come
to
a
wc
just
to
see
if
the
dutch
or
the
english
or
the
germans
are
the
best
bruisers
which
other
sports
are
you
talking
about
i
dont
think
soccer
is
every
possible
sport
it
really
pisses
me
off
i
do
not
mean
that
every
single
german
has
this
attitude
that
sucks
but
most
of
them
seem
to
do
how
many
germans
do
you
know
do
you
think
out
of
is
most
of
them
if
you
hear
about
some
white
policemen
beating
a
black
man
in
the
us
what
do
you
think
about
the
americans
most
of
them
like
beating
blacks
