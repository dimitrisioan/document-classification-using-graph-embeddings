the
problem
espn
faces
is
the
tcicablevision
connection
in
the
merger
of
their
prime
and
sportschannel
networks
prime
sportschannel
will
try
to
wrestle
away
nhl
from
espn
in
the
offseason
also
tci
and
cablevision
have
control
a
large
number
of
cable
systems
around
the
country
with
a
total
of
million
subscribers
tcicablevision
will
do
their
best
that
espn
never
gets
off
the
ground
successfully
and
the
nhls
value
will
suddenly
skyrocket
in
this
cable
war
between
prime
sc
and
espn
nhl
is
more
vital
to
the
survival
of
a
regionalized
prime
sportschannel
since
they
virtually
have
no
national
major
league
sports
contracts
and
only
cover
local
nhlnbamlb
sports
teams
note
that
this
ominous
prospect
is
fueled
by
the
fact
that
various
sc
and
prime
outlets
are
wholly
or
partly
owned
by
local
nhl
owners

cablevision
vp
chuck
dolans
purchase

the
islanders
will
be
back
solidly
in
the
scny
fold
their
original
owners
were
and
theyve
remained
due
to
a
lucrative
tv
contract
the
flyer
snyders
own
the
philadelphia
sc
as
well
as
the
prism
pay
channel
there
are
six
teams
affiliated
with
regional
scs
another
half
dozen
affiliated
with
prime
outlets
and
other
locals
like
hts
and
nesn
who
have
barter
arrangements
with
all
this
crossownership
i
was
