the
penguins
game
unbeaten
streak
carries
over
to
next
season
meaning
if
they
start
the
season
with
another
game
unbeaten
streak
they
will
have
eclipsed
the
flyers
record
right
now
the
penguins
are
on
an
game
winning
streak
as
streaks
carry
over
from
one
year
to
another
hmmmm
im
not
sure
this
is
true
according
to
mike
lang
and
good
old
stagie
along
with
the
rest
of
the
tv
crews
in
pittsburgh
they
winning
streak
could
have
stopped
because
it
is
a
regular
season
mark
i
would
think
this
would
also
hold
with
an
unbeaten
streak
for
regular
season
games
however
you
are
right
that
the
playoff
streak
does
carry
over
from
last
year
and
with
more
win
i
believe
they
tie
an
edmonton
record
but
dont
quote
me
on
that
one
robbie
po
pgh
penguins
it
wont
be
easy
but
it
contact
for
the
stanley
cup
will
have
greater
rewards
penn
state
lady
lions
champions
mountains
and
valleys
are
straight
wins
better
than
nothing
at
all
