vasili
tichonov
exassat
to
san
jose
sharks
wow
so
thats
probably
the
reason
why
current
assistant
coach
drew
ramenda
hinted
that
he
wont
be
back
thanks
for
the
news
mikko
can
you
or
any
of
our
finnish
netters
comment
on
tichonov
the
first
time
i
heard
this
piece
of
news
was
on
the
post
game
radio
interview
here
in
jyvaskyla
that
was
the
bronze
medal
game
in
the
smliiga
which
tichonovs
team
porin
assat
the
aces
of
town
pori
lost
vasili
the
son
of
victor
tichonov
the
famous
soviet
coach
said
that
for
a
long
time
the
sharks
have
been
persuading
him
to
take
the
assistant
coach
post
but
he
wants
to
be
the
head
coach
where
ever
he
goes
he
definitely
wont
be
coaching
assat
anymore
after
three
seasons
i
dont
know
why
vasili
is
a
good
coach
i
believe
assat
was
a
good
team
produced
many
players
to
our
national
team
assat
wasnt
a
skilled
team
imho
but
they
had
the
fighting
spirit
after
all
they
butchered
jokerit
in
the
playoffs
and
gave
hard
time
to
tps
the
champs
but
assat
wasnt
consistent
only
when
they
were
in
the
right
mood
they
could
beat
any
team
in
the
smliiga
i
am
not
sure
about
the
deal
with
the
sharks
as
i
said
he
wants
to
be
the
head
coach
but
he
and
the
sharks
are
going
to
negotiate
and
decide
during
the
wc
i
doubt
that
he
will
be
the
head
coach
but
maybe
theyll
do
some
compromise
could
somebody
post
more
information
about
vasili
i
know
he
was
coaching
in
the
former
soviet
league
teams
results
his
character
as
a
coach
