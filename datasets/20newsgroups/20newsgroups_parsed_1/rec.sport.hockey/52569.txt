writes
implicitly
you
are
assuming
that
goals
scored
against
winnipeg
with
selanne
on
the
ice
can
be
blamed
on
himroger
he
is
a
forward
winnipeg
has
a
lousy
defensive
record
anyway
lets
put
it
another
way
john
cullens
is
terrible
whats
your
excuse
for
him
that
his
powerplay
points
dont
count
neither
do
selannes
are
you
comparing
cullen
to
salami
i
would
say
that
that
is
valid
if
winnipeg
is
such
a
lousy
defensive
team
then
why
the
hell
does
salami
stand
around
the
other
teams
blueline
when
the
puck
is
in
his
own
end
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
feed
selanne
it
is
to
win
and
feeding
selanne
does
not
contribute
in
any
meaningful
way
to
winning
knowledgeable
hockey
observers
the
world
over
would
agree
that
feeding
selanne
so
he
can
score
does
contribute
in
a
meaningful
way
to
winning
excuse
me
are
the
jets
playing
hockey
let
me
checkyes
but
just
barely
they
have
allowed
more
goals
than
they
have
scored
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
salamis
to
me
sounds
like
they
would
be
just
as
well
off
or
better
if
he
played
the
solid
twoway
game
that
our
friends
in
finland
claim
he
is
capable
of
but
if
he
did
that
he
wouldnt
be
chal
lenging
for
the
league
lead
in
goals
would
he
the
biplanes
might
be
challenging
for
first
however
youre
worried
about
teemu
when
you
have
glenn
anderson
on
your
team
now
lets
seeyou
have
compared
timo
to
anderson
and
cullen
whos
next
mike
foligno
we
dont
know
what
selanne
does
best
we
do
know
what
jets
management
wants
and
again
the
object
of
the
exercise
is
not
to
allow
selanne
to
do
what
he
does
best
it
is
to
win
hockey
games
what
he
does
best
is
scoreso
i
refer
you
to
my
comment
above
some
of
our
finnish
friends
who
have
watched
him
play
claim
that
he
can
play
a
solid
twoway
game
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
style
of
contribution
would
be
more
conducive
to
winning
or
dont
you
think
so
as
it
is
now
selanne
is
a
grandstanding
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way
he
parades
around
with
his
arms
outstretched
after
scoring
a
goal
you
would
think
the
messiah
had
returned
nope
didnt
see
it
i
was
too
busy
watching
foligno
jump
up
and
down
after
his
goal
i
dont
believe
it
you
did
compare
him
to
foligno
and
i
honestly
hadnt
read
this
far
it
would
help
if
you
used
a
little
discrimination
in
your
thinking
your
contributions
would
be
more
highly
valued
if
we
could
see
that
you
werent
trying
to
be
merely
argumentative
cordially
as
always
