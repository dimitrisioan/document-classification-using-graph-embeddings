re
minnesota
shame
ive
been
under
the
impression
that
minnesota
was
one
of
or
possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
norman
green
claims
that
he
has
lost
money
over
the
last
three
years
that
he
has
owned
the
team
when
he
bought
the
team
it
seemed
kind
of
obvious
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
deal
with
a
few
years
in
the
red
before
the
team
started
making
a
profit
again
he
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
willing
to
do
so
he
claimed
two
years
ago
that
the
team
needed
to
average
only
fans
per
game
in
order
to
pull
a
profit
but
this
season
the
team
averaged
fans
despite
increasd
ticket
prices
i
think
the
teams
attendence
and
play
was
clearly
in
an
upward
trend
which
leaves
me
dumbfounded
as
to
how
he
could
ignore
that
in
deciding
to
move
he
was
even
offered
the
many
concessions
he
rudely
demanded
such
as
guaranteed
season
ticket
sales
cheap
rent
at
the
other
two
arenas
in
town
etc
oh
well
i
guess
the
bottom
line
is
green
wanted
immediate
huge
returns
in
dallas
and
wasnt
willing
to
wait
another
year
or
so
in
mn
dallas
gave
green
a
pretty
stellar
deal
to
play
there
although
i
feel
minnesotas
was
quite
reasonable
and
he
also
has
some
cronies
down
there
as
well
all
this
means
is
that
minnesota
is
without
an
nhl
team
for
a
year
or
two
too
bad
for
the
nhl
kea
