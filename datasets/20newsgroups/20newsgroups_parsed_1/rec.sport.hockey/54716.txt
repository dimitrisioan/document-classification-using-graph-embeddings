last
nights
game
toronto
received
five
penalties
detroit
none
if
which
game
were
you
watching
didnt
you
see
the
third
period
when
the
wings
had
penalties
called
on
them
and
then
a
delayed
penalty
the
leafs
had
a
man
advantage
for
about
a
minute
and
a
man
advantage
for
another
minute
or
two
and
the
leafs
still
couldnt
score
and
i
wonder
how
the
leafs
scored
a
powerplay
goal
if
according
to
you
they
never
had
a
powerplay
in
the
detroit
paper
today
it
said
there
were
penalties
called
in
last
nights
game
and
youre
saying
detroit
had
none
of
those
penalties
im
guessing
you
only
watched
the
first
period
i
have
to
admitt
the
leafs
did
get
alot
of
penalties
in
that
period
where
as
the
wings
didnt
get
many
if
any
at
all
havent
looked
at
the
box
scores
yet
but
the
ref
more
than
made
up
for
it
in
the
third
period

go
wings
my
apologies
for
the
typo
i
meant
the
wings
had
power
plays
in
the
first
period
and
the
leafs
none
as
well
my
point
isnt
that
the
refs
were
biased
just
that
they
were
calling
a
lot
of
penalties
which
works
to
the
benefit
of
the
wings
having
the
ref
call
a
whole
bunch
of
penalties
against
one
team
then
calling
a
bunch
against
the
other
to
make
up
for
it
takes
a
lot
away
from
what
could
have
been
a
great
game
