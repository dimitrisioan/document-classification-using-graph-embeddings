leafs
versus
wings
how
long
can
the
leafs
play
shorthanded
and
still
be
expected
to
score
they
did
some
fine
penelykilling
in
the
first
men
down
for
a
couple
of
minutes
at
one
point
but
they
just
couldnt
keep
it
up
they
spent
virtually
the
entire
game
either
shorthanded
or
just
coming
off
a
penelty
as
soon
as
theyd
get
regrouped
theyre
penalized
again
sheesh
like
gilmour
said
after
the
st
you
cant
go
calling
every
little
push
an
shove
in
a
game
like
that
and
if
youre
going
to
you
have
to
do
it
for
both
teams
pearson
one
of
my
four
favorite
leafs
played
like
a
bonehead
i
saw
him
personally
screw
up
at
least
good
scoring
opportunities
and
then
he
got
that
bonehead
minute
major
highsticking
penalty
cullen
has
gotten
stronger
since
his
return
from
injury
a
handfull
of
games
ago
and
he
played
a
good
game
if
the
other
players
on
his
line
can
smarten
up
that
line
should
do
okay
clarks
got
to
get
tough
hes
got
to
intimidate
and
go
for
the
net
send
clark
up
the
left
wing
over
the
blue
line
a
couple
times
his
patented
wrist
shot
will
put
some
numbers
on
the
board
and
pearson
heck
maybe
he
should
be
benched
i
hate
to
repeat
grapes
but
where
the
heck
was
foligno
zezel
cant
do
all
the
checking
himself
and
get
macllwain
on
the
move
we
need
some
speed
out
there
keep
potvin
in
net
he
did
okay
considering
although
like
i
said
a
couple
weeks
ago
potvin
messed
up
in
a
couple
games
in
the
ahl
playoffs
last
year
he
can
easily
do
it
again
my
prediction
last
week
was
toronto
in
that
the
games
det
wins
will
be
blowouts
and
the
game
tor
wins
will
be
close
i
still
stand
by
that
dont
fret
leafs
fans
in
order
to
win
in
the
other
team
has
to
win
burns
is
going
to
make
some
magic
hell
mix
up
some
lines
match
the
wings
lineperline
hell
have
his
team
checking
hard
and
hell
never
let
them
get
outnumbered
in
their
own
end
the
leafs
will
win
wednesday
night
and
will
take
or
their
home
games
probably
the
first
one
