re
too
many
european
in
nhl
ra
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
r
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
ra
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
r
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
ra
isnt
it
i
disagree
i
think
the
nhl
should
feature
the
best
hockey
talent
in
the
world
regardless
of
nationality
i
have
to
admit
that
when
i
see
players
like
gretzky
and
messier
traded
off
to
the
us
because
the
canadian
teams
cant
afford
them
i
have
been
know
to
say
only
half
seriously
that
wed
probably
be
better
off
if
we
had
our
own
canadian
hockey
league
for
canadian
players
ra
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
ra
te
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
ra
