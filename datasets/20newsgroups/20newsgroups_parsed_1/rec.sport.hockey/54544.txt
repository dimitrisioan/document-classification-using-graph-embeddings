one
last
point
darryl
sutter
is
getting
badly
out
coached
by
bob
berry
the
madder
darryl
gets
the
more
he
reminds
me
of
brian
the
hawks
are
quickly
loosing
thier
focus
i
dont
think
the
blues
will
win
in
but
you
never
know
not
to
sutter
bash
or
anything
since
i
idolized
them
as
players
you
sure
would
think
the
sutters
would
learn
something
about
burning
out
their
teams
in
the
regular
seasonjust
too
much
intensity
during
the
regular
season
i
earlier
posted
a
note
about
brian
and
got
to
thinking
after
i
read
this
itemgee
both
sutters
won
their
divisions
and
now
both
have
lost
home
ice
advantage
and
are
getting
smoked
in
their
opening
series
in
the
playoffs
kind
of
makes
you
wonder
bottom
lineman
it
is
great
to
be
smoking
the
warthawks
agreed
jimthis
has
been
damn
sweet
so
far
about
the
only
thing
that
comes
close
to
this
is
shutting
up
all
the
maple
laugh
fansdetroit
has
completely
kicked
their
asses
so
far
but
i
will
stick
with
the
blues
for
providing
the
best
playoff
tonic
so
far
