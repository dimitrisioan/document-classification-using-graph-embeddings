does
anyone
recieve
annoying
email
from
roger
maynard
whenever
they
post
an
article
telling
them
to
leave
him
alon
and
stop
posting
to
the
group
these
emails
are
filled
with
insults
more
than
are
usual
in
rogers
posts
and
have
little
if
any
hockey
info
i
have
recieved
two
in
the
last
days
i
am
just
wondering
if
i
am
special
or
roger
trys
to
bully
everyone
who
disagrees
with
him
gregmeister
you
cant
be
serious
i
and
many
of
my
colleagues
have
not
received
any
bad
emails
from
roger
in
fact
roger
happens
to
have
answered
most
if
not
all
of
my
hockey
questions
and
curiosities
so
before
you
start
flaming
at
me
or
roger
better
reconsider
your
nasty
attitude
towards
roger
and
the
like
