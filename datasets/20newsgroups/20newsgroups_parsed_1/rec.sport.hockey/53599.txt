did
anyone
else
see
this
game
last
night
just
like
a
playoff
game
lots
of
hittingbut
i
was
disappointed
by
the
video
goal
judge
on
all
replays
joe
murphys
goal
shouldnt
have
counted
it
didnt
go
in
net
and
according
to
the
tsn
broadcasters
the
video
goal
judge
said
that
he
saw
the
water
bottle
on
top
of
the
cage
move
so
he
assumed
the
puck
went
in
this
is
terriblehope
crap
like
this
doesnt
occur
in
the
playoffs
the
game
would
have
ended
in
tie
i
thought
the
red
light
went
onthus
in
the
review
the
presumption
would
be
to
find
conclusive
evidence
that
the
puck
did
not
go
in
the
netfrom
the
replays
i
say
even
from
the
rear
the
evidence
wasnt
conclusive
that
the
puck
was
in
or
outin
my
opinion
gerald
