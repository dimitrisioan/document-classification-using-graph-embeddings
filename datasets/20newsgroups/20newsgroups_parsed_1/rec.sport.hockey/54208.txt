the
usa
today
says
late
this
year
the
question
is
will
hockey
be
moved
to
espn
permenantly
or
will
it
be
where
they
have
a
game
of
the
week
on
espn
and
have
a
bunch
of
other
games
on
espn
yes
and
no
espn
will
be
launched
as
early
in
september
cap
cities
are
currently
working
with
cable
companies
to
ensure
a
good
startup
base
needed
for
a
launch
for
any
brand
new
cable
service
the
problem
espn
faces
is
the
tcicablevision
connection
in
the
merger
of
their
prime
and
sportschannel
networks
prime
sportschannel
will
try
to
wrestle
away
nhl
from
espn
in
the
offseason
alsotci
and
cablevision
have
control
a
large
number
of
cable
systems
around
the
country
with
a
total
of
million
subscribers
tcicablevision
will
do
their
best
that
espn
never
gets
off
the
ground
successfully
and
the
nhls
value
will
suddenly
skyrocket
in
this
cable
war
between
prime
sc
and
espn
nhl
is
more
vital
to
the
survival
of
a
regionalized
prime
sportschannel
since
they
virtually
have
no
national
major
league
sports
contracts
and
only
cover
local
