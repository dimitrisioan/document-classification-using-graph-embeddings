draft
shawn
luddington
writes
as
for
the
picks
ottawa
picks
which
means
it
is
almost
that
alexander
daigle
will
go
hell
either
stay
or
be
traded
in
montreal
or
quebec
i
dunno
about
hat
i
have
friends
up
there
on
genie
who
are
now
saying
that
ottawas
gone
soft
on
daigle
and
is
thinking
hard
about
pronger
daigle
has
shown
an
attitude
the
latter
part
of
this
season
many
folks
havnet
liked
and
after
coming
back
from
his
second
multigame
suspension
for
being
stupid
hes
really
tanked
in
his
performance
his
stock
is
dropping
like
a
rock
also
remember
that
a
lot
of
teh
draft
st
stuff
comes
from
the
assumption
hell
be
traded
to
quebec
for
lots
of
prospects
its
not
clear
that
quebec
would
really
be
willing
to
pay
a
lot
for
him
given
his
current
status
hes
still
first
round
but
i
dont
consider
him
a
first
pick
lock
by
any
means
at
this
point
its
also
possible
that
the
senators
are
posturing
to
try
to
bring
down
his
signing
price
since
daigle
has
been
taking
some
lindros
lessons
during
thos
suspensions
imo
i
would
take
kariya
he
should
alot
of
leadership
in
the
ncaa
and
so
far
in
the
world
championships
daigle
didnt
show
this
for
his
junior
team
san
jose
will
then
get
kariya
no
kariya
wont
go
in
the
first
three
for
a
very
simple
reason
hes
not
leaving
college
and
i
dont
believe
any
of
the
expansion
teams
are
going
to
use
a
first
for
someone
who
wont
be
around
for
another
year
or
two
not
when
there
is
equally
good
or
almost
as
good
stuff
available
that
can
make
an
immediate
impact
san
jose
seems
to
be
leaning
heavily
towards
niedermayer
for
that
reason
kariya
could
go
th
or
th
unless
a
team
can
convince
him
to
leave
school
early
which
i
doubt
my
cut
on
things
as
they
stand
today
draft
order
ottawa
daigle
if
not
pronger
san
jose
niedermayer
unless
ottawa
skips
daigle
then
its
open
it
depends
on
if
the
sharks
can
get
a
deal
for
him
i
dont
believe
they
draft
him
to
keep
him
tampa
bay
whoever
ottawa
doesnt
take

maybe
