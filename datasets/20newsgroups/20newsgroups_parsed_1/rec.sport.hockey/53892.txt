they
guy
who
badmouthed
ulf
ditto
if
we
allow
people
like
him
to
continue
to
do
what
he
does
its
a
shame
people
say
that
cheap
shots
and
drawing
penalties
by
fake
ing
is
part
of
the
game
i
say
bullsht
if
he
ever
tried
some
like
that
on
a
yzerman
hed
would
have
to
deal
with
probert
now
wouldnt
he
what
ulf
does
isnt
even
retaliatory
theres
now
way
one
could
justify
what
he
does
and
if
they
do
theyre
fools
