i
really
feel
the
need
for
a
knowledgable
hockey
observer
to
explain
this
years
playoffs
to
me
i
mean
the
obviously
superior
toronto
team
with
the
best
center
and
the
best
goalie
in
the
league
keeps
losing
what
gives
unfortunately
roger
is
now
over
at
rsbaseball
spewing
his
expertise
ie
being
a
dickhead
i
guess
he
is
afraid
of
posting
anything
here
because
he
knows
what
to
expect
it
is
indeed
nice
to
have
fans
that
are
concerned
about
the
dearth
of
disputatious
dissertation
linked
to
my
hiatus
have
simply
been
too
damned
busy
lately
to
keep
you
lads
and
lassies
entertained
you
can
be
sure
however
that
i
will
somehow
manage
to
find
time
to
woof
if
the
leafs
give
just
cause
and
lets
all
try
to
keep
peoples
names
especially
mine
out
of
the
subject
headers
i
for
one
neither
seek
nor
enjoy
such
a
cheap
form
of
notoriety
one
thing
you
can
be
assured
of
however
is
this
the
leafs
are
the
best
of
all
the
teams
in
the
league
that
have
allowed
goals
in
games
cordially
as
always
so
many
morons
rm
and
so
little
time
