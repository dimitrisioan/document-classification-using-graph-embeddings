when
was
the
last
time
a
presidents
trophy
winner
fell
to
last
place
the
following
year
a
long
time
id
bet
well
i
think
it
in
the
montreal
canadians
finished
st
although
there
was
no
presidents
cup
in
those
days
and
missed
the
playoffs
in
i
do
recall
that
the
playoff
picture
wasnt
decided
until
the
final
day
when
the
ny
rangers
defeated
the
redwings
the
tiebreaker
was
the
number
of
goals
for
if
i
remember
correctly
so
the
rangers
played
with
an
empty
net
for
the
entire
game
some
hab
loyalists
accused
the
wings
of
throwing
the
game
to
keep
them
out
but
as
i
recall
gordie
and
delvecchio
had
the
flu
so
coach
sid
abel
sat
them
out
and
the
rangers
swarmed
the
redwings
most
of
the
night
