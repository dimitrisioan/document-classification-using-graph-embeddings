re
caps
moving
in
writes
ive
heard
rumors
recently
from
reliable
sources
that
abe
polin
the
moron
who
owns
the
washington
capitals
is
looking
to
move
the
team
after
this
season
or
next
milwaukee
was
mentioned
as
the
teams
potential
destination
the
person
who
told
me
this
is
strongly
affiliated
with
the
nhl
and
has
been
extremely
accurate
in
the
past
with
news
of
this
sort
does
anyone
know
if
this
is
so
or
has
heard
anything
of
the
sort
with
baltimores
ahl
team
gone
that
would
leave
the
area
with
only
an
echl
franchise
in
baltimore
not
good
thanks
david
why
dcbaltimore
is
one
of
the
top
media
markets
the
only
thing
the
nhl
seems
to
care
about
these
days
theyve
been
doing
far
better
than
the
nba
bullets
at
the
gate
for
the
last
five
years
the
team
has
been
a
perennial
contender
and
fan
support
has
been
good
to
excellent
why
should
pollin
move
to
city
thats
five
times
smaller
but
has
as
many
teams
in
other
pro
sports
i
dont
get
it
