the
hawks
will

the
finals

brian
johnson
writes
well
now
that
the
hawks
have
won
the
division
the
road
is
a
little
easier
for
the
playoffs
let
toronto
and
detroit
beat
the
hell
out
of
each
other
while
chicago
sweeps
stlouis
that
just
makes
it
easier
in
the
second
round
with
all
the
rest
they
will
get
and
tordet
getting
none
for
the
conf
champ
they
will
have
a
hard
time
versus
the
division
but
that
div
will
be
pretty
battered
also
so
the
advantage
goes
to
the
hawks
again
then
bring
pitt
and
sure
the
hawks
will
probably
lose
but
its
better
to
get
that
far
and
lose
than
to
not
go
brian
hopefully
a
miracle
ok
not
quite
a
miracle
but
close
will
occur
and
pittsburgh
will
be
elminated
prior
to
the
finals
if
they
make
it
again
they
will
probably
keep
the
cup
if
they
dont
its
the
hawks
turn
go
blackhawks
congrats
to
jeremy
roenick
for
being
only
the
nd
hawks
player
to
post
back
to
back
goal
