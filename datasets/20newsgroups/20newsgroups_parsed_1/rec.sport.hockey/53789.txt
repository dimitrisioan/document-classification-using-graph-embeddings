the
detroit
red
wings
put
a
lot
of
doubter
on
ice
tonight
with
a
washing
of
the
toronto
maple
leafs
all
you
toronto
fans
have
now
seen
the
power
of
the
mighty
red
wing
offense
torontos
defense
in
no
match
for
the
wing
offense
as
for
the
defense
probert
kennedey
and
primeau
came
out
did
they
move
probert
back
to
defense
why
did
i
see
him
parking
his
ass
in
front
of
potvin
all
night
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
discipline
probert
if
the
leafs
want
to
win
the
series
perhaps
a
fresh
clark
should
hit
the
ice
at
the
end
of
a
long
probert
shift
and
straigten
him
out
for
a
while
during
the
regular
season
when
the
intensity
is
down
not
many
teams
have
forwards
who
will
continually
go
and
park
themselves
in
front
of
the
opposing
teams
netand
the
inadequacy
of
the
leafs
defense
in
this
regard
thus
didnt
matterhowever
the
playoffs
are
a
different
storyevery
good
team
is
going
to
have
players
who
are
going
to
become
potted
plants
in
front
of
potvinand
the
leafs
relatively
unphysical
defensive
core
will
finally
be
exposed
as
weak
an
inept
hard
work
will
go
a
long
way
during
the
regular
seasonalmost
to
pointsand
the
leafs
deserve
credit
for
thatbut
in
the
playoffs
talent
matters
because
everyone
begins
working
hard
