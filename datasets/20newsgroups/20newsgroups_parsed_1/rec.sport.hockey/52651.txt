on

were

biggest

my
votes
fwiw
team
mvp
pat
verbeek
he
fans
on
of
goal
mouth
feeds
but
he
still
has
goals
after
a
terrible
start
and
has
been
an
examplary
sp
team
captain
throughout
a
tough
couple
of
seasons
honorable
mention
nick
kypreos
and
mark
janssens
probably
more
appropriate
in
the
unsung
heroes
category
than
mvp
but
kypreos
goals
pim
has
been
the
hardest
working
player
on
the
team
and
janssens
is
underrated
as
a
defensive
center
and
checker
i
guess
i
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
hard
work
than
skill
when
determining
value
biggest
surprise
geoff
sanderson
he
had
goals
and
points
last
season
as
a
center
then
moved
to
left
wing
and
has
so
far
put
up
goals
and
points
he
now
has
a
new
whaler
record
power
play
goals
most
all
coming
from
the
right
wing
faceoff
circle
his
garden
spot
honorable
mention
andrew
cassels
and
terry
yake
the
kiddie
quartet
of
sanderson
poulin
nylander
and
petrovicky
have
been
attracting
the
most
attention
but
cassels
is
just
and
will
score
close
to
points
this
season
he
has
quite
nicely
assumed
the
role
of
number
one
center
on
the
team
and
works
very
well
with
sanderson
yake
bounced
around
the
minors
for
a
number
of
seasons
but
is
still
and
will
put
up
about
goals
and
points
this
season
yake
like
sanderson
started
performing
better
offensively
once
he
was
converted
from
center
to
wing
although
lefty
sanderson
went
to
the
left
wing
and
righty
yake
went
to
the
right
side
biggest
disappointment
hands
down
john
cullen
cullen
had
a
disasterous
point
season
last
year
his
first
full
season
after
the
trade
cullen
started
the
season
off
of
summer
back
surgery
and
fell
flat
on
his
face
appropriate
since
he
spent
all
of
his
whaler
career
flat
on
his
ass
and
whining
about
it
cullen
scored
just
point
on
games
was
a
clubhouse
malcontent
commanded
the
powerplay
to
a
success
percentage
with
sanderson
and
sulked
his
way
out
of
town
worst
of
all
his
year
m
contract
had
three
years
left
to
run
so
no
one
would
give
up
any
more
than
the
nd
round
draft
pick
the
maple
leafs
offered
to
hartford
honorable
mention
steve
konroyd
also
subpar
after
signing
a
year
m
contract
eric
weinrich
who
showed
flashes
of
competence
but
overall
has
played
poorly
jim
mckenzie
who
was
a
much
better
hockey
player
two
seasons
ago
than
he
is
now
and
frank
pietrangelo
who
only
seemed
to
play
well
when
sean
burke
was
out
for
an
extended
period
and
he
got
to
make
a
number
of
starts
in
a
row
sg
a
real
live
hartford
