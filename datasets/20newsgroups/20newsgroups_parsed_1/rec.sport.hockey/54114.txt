i
hadnt
heard
about
this
new
espn
when
is
this
new
network
supposed
to
start
sounds
great
to
me
as
long
as
my
cable
co
offers
it
hopefully
epsn
will
use
the
lesson
given
by
the
master
ted
turner
the
season
ted
introduced
tnt
many
cable
cos
refused
to
put
it
on
saying
that
gee
we
get
enough
old
movies
miniseries
etc
on
tbs
usa
amc
wgn
wor
why
do
we
need
another
one
this
was
in
the
fall
come
spring
ted
fixed
their
little
red
wagons
good
the
previous
spring
nba
playoffs
wore
on
tbs
now
they
were
on
tnt
and
still
are
and
everyone
gets
tnt
now
so
espn
should
put
nfl
football
and
baseball
on
espn
and
leave
hockey
on
espn
and
if
cable
cos
play
games
and
drop
espn
in
favor
of
espn
espn
should
alternate
baseball
and
football
between
channels
every
week
but
do
the
espn
guys
collectively
have
the
gonads
of
the
turner
guy
mike
eisler
not
only
are
they
leafs
the
best
team
but
their
fans
are
even
more
intelligent
and
insightful
than
pittsburghs
their
players
are
mighty
bright
too
i
mean
he
really
was
going
to
get
his
wallet
back
right
