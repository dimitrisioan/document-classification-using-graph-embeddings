episode
summary
once
again
the
episode
started
with
a
shot
of
dons
tie
this
was
a
different
tie
than
last
time
don
pointed
out
some
of
the
characters
on
the
tie
but
gave
them
different
names
felix
the
cat
sylverster
maclean
daffy
duck
etc
ron
maclean
asked
don
what
he
thought
of
the
current
wingsleafs
game
don
thought
it
was
good
burns
told
the
leaf
players
they
won
in
their
building
were
going
to
win
in
ours
don
then
began
to
praise
gilmour
again
don
pointed
out
that
gilmour
has
never
got
less
than
points
or
a
goal
in
any
game
since
he
got
points
in
a
game
against
st
louis
don
also
claims
that
he
gave
a
lot
of
encouragement
to
gilmour
which
was
partly
responsible
for
his
good
play
several
clips
were
then
shown
of
gilmour
from
the
series
a
hit
on
constantinov
and
a
pass
to
andrewchuk
resulting
in
a
goal
on
the
game
itself
the
wings
were
taking
a
lot
of
penalties
in
the
first
period
the
wings
have
enough
talent
to
score
short
handed
however
and
when
the
leafs
get
a
power
play
coach
burns
tells
the
leaf
players
dont
let
them
score
on
you
ron
brought
up
the
previous
quebecmontreal
game
note
montreal
won
that
game
in
overtime
despite
having
a
possible
game
winner
disqualified
because
it
was
batted
in
with
a
high
stick
don
thought
the
high
stick
was
obvious
even
without
the
use
of
instant
replay
on
the
buffaloboston
series
note
buffalo
is
currently
winning
the
series
don
gave
full
credit
to
goaltender
grant
fuhr
fuhr
should
be
getting
the
teams
playoff
checks
for
his
play
wendel
clarke
has
recently
been
criticized
for
his
performance
during
the
detroittoronto
series
don
defended
him
by
saying
that
he
cant
play
the
way
he
should
because
of
the
leagues
new
rules
this
used
to
be
a
rough
and
tough
league
now
its
all
hack
and
slash
don
lays
the
blame
on
gil
stien
for
the
problems
dons
opinions
on
fighting
and
stickwork
are
shared
by
wings
gm
and
coach
bryan
murray
a
clip
from
a
news
conference
by
murray
was
shown
in
which
murray
made
statements
claiming
the
elimination
of
fighting
increases
stickwork
don
also
read
a
newspaper
article
in
which
murray
makes
the
following
statements
players
dont
fight
because
theyre
afraid
of
getting
thrown
out
of
the
game
as
instigator
instead
they
settle
grudges
by
getting
their
sticks
and
slicing
each
other
is
this
what
the
fans
want
to
see
i
guarantee
there
wouldnt
be
as
many
slashes
if
fighting
were
kept
in
the
game
don
warned
league
commisioner
gary
bettman
to
smarten
up
with
fighting
in
hockey
he
went
on
to
say
that
before
there
used
to
be
one
guy
cut
with
a
high
stick
in
a
series
now
with
no
fights
someone
gets
cut
every
period
rating
typical
antifighting
posturing
but
here
dons
opinion
is
supported
by
murray
id
give
it
a
out
of
