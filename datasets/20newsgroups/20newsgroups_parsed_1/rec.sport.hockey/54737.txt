okay
the
caps
again
are
about
to
break
out
the
golf
clubs
but
before
they
do
does
anyone
have
the
history
of
the
washington
capitals
futility
record
in
the
playoffs
i
remember
that
terrys
first
year
was
the
first
year
that
the
caps
finally
made
it
to
the
third
round
but
before
under
brian
i
noticed
that
every
other
year
the
caps
got
to
the
second
round
and
the
years
in
between
they
didnt
make
it
past
the
first
round
is
this
trend
continuning
this
is
not
a
trend
the
caps
were
done
goneso
in
five
games
and
it
saves
us
caps
fans
a
lot
of
pain
i
mean
it
would
be
more
painful
if
the
caps
were
up
watching
them
tumbled
when
they
need
one
more
win
to
clinch
the
series
how
many
times
have
they
done
that
in
their
history
up
in
a
five
game
series
against
the
isles
lost
straight
up
against
the
isles
lost
straight
up
against
the
pens
lost
straight
in
other
words
when
they
were
about
to
clinch
with
games
to
go
they
were
a
pitiful
the
lone
wins
being
a
sweep
of
philly
in
the
win
against
the
rangers
in
the
patrick
finals
the
only
time
they
managed
to
get
out
of
the
division
actually
saturdays
blown
lead
wasnt
anything
new
we
all
know
the
caps
are
famous
lead
blowers
in
crucial
playoff
games
examples
game
against
the
isles
led
after
two
lead
series
gave
up
goals
in
the
rd
period
including
the
game
winning
goal
in
the
last
minute
after
that
goal
bobby
carpenter
botched
a
penalty
shot
series
tied
lost
game
a
few
days
later
game
against
the
rangers
led
series
led
by
in
the
rd
period
blew
it
lost
game
in
ot
and
three
consecutive
games
game
against
pittsurgh
led
series
led
by
in
nd
period
blew
it
and
the
series
game
against
isles
series
tied
led
by
after
blew
it
game
against
isles
trailed
series
led
by
in
nd
period
blew
it
again
when
they
were
leading
by
in
game
i
said
to
myself
if
they
blew
this
lead
the
series
is
over
they
have
lost
all
the
momemtum
the
islanders
believe
they
can
come
back
no
matter
what
the
score
is
i
am
still
waiting
for
a
cap
goalie
who
can
carry
the
team
who
can
completely
shut
down
the
opposition
when
they
are
hanging
on
their
dear
lives
in
a
crucial
game
the
admiral
a
hopeless
caps
fan
ps
we
still
remember
that
ot
loss
to
the
islanders
aurggghhhhhhhhh
well
some
teams
such
have
it
and
some
teams
just
dont
when
the
caps
were
frustrated
year
in
year
out
by
the
islanders
i
was
thinking
wait
until
potvinbossytrottiersmith
retire
well
they
retired
even
though
trottier
was
still
able
to
haunt
the
caps
on
a
pens
uniform
yet
another
generation
of
islanders
were
still
doing
the
same
thing
well
i
guess
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
players
