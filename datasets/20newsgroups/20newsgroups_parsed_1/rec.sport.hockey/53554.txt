re
playoff
predictions
st
round
pitt
vs
nyi
pitt
in
it
looks
like
a
safe
bet
nyi
has
been
bagging
it
of
late
nyi
and
njd
have
a
showdown
friday
night
for
the
honour
of
pittsburg
anyway
pigsburg
in
wash
vs
njd
wash
in
i
think
that
njd
have
a
solid
team
and
will
compete
with
wash
i
agree
though
with
wash
in
bos
vs
buf
bos
in
the
bs
have
been
playing
awesome
hockey
in
the
last
two
weeks
the
only
question
is
how
long
will
it
last
fuhr
is
a
dud
bos
in
que
vs
mon
mon
in
it
seems
to
me
that
mon
is
much
like
the
van
no
chemistry
the
habs
seem
to
be
not
in
stride
que
in
chi
vs
stl
chi
in
stl
should
not
be
in
the
playoffs
chi
in
det
vs
tor
det
in
i
am
a
diehard
leaf
fan
but
it
seems
that
the
leafs
offense
is
shutting
down
in
the
last
week
can
they
turn
it
around
against
detroit
as
i
recall
the
last
couple
of
time
these
two
teams
met
the
leafs
were
pummelled
i
dont
know
if
bobbie
is
allowed
in
canada
yet
if
he
is
det
in
if
not
det
in
van
vs
win
win
in
upset
in
the
making
here
another
team
with
bad
chemistry
there
is
something
gone
foul
among
linden
momesso
and
bure
win
in
cal
vs
la
cal
in
anybody
that
says
that
la
could
possibly
beet
cal
does
not
watch
the
smythe
a
whole
lot
la
is
a
bunch
of
geritols
cal
in
nd
round
pitt
vs
wash
pitt
in
it
seems
to
me
that
pigsburg
has
some
egos
on
their
team
their
saving
grace
though
is
bowman
he
can
put
anybody
in
their
place
however
if
pigs
have
a
quick
first
round
they
may
be
a
little
too
high
wash
could
be
there
for
a
surprise
having
said
that
i
will
say
pitt
in
bos
vs
mon
bos
in
mon
will
not
be
there
bos
is
surprising
me
of
late
cam
is
great
the
couple
of
wins
against
que
last
week
have
sold
me
with
the
bs
bs
in
chi
vs
det
chi
in
yikes
this
will
not
be
pretty
but
det
is
running
like
a
machine
of
late
theyve
had
a
nonbusy
end
of
the
season
in
which
they
played
like
killers
det
in
win
vs
cal
cal
in
cal
has
a
solid
team
a
little
weak
in
the
nets
cal
will
out
muscle
win
cal
in
rd
round
pitt
vs
bos
pitt
in
i
hate
pitt
my
logic
eludes
me
the
dark
side
will
take
over
and
give
bos
the
extra
push
it
needs
to
dump
pitt
there
may
be
something
to
this
if
you
think
of
the
rivalry
bos
in
chi
vs
cal
chi
in
finals
pitt
vs
chi
pitt
in
no
no
no
we
have
bos
vs
det
i
dont
know
what
to
say
here
both
teams
will
be
flying
and
overdue
i
will
go
with
goaltending
and
muscle
and
say
det
in
jake
