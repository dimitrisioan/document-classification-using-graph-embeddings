quebec
dominated
habs
for
first
periods
and
only
roy
kept
this
one
from
being
rout
although
he
did
blow
nd
goal
canadians
showed
up
in
third
but
nords
were
playing
dump
pull
back
most
of
the
time
do
you
notice
that
nobody
on
the
team
is
willing
to
take
charge
a
dominant
defenceman
would
be
nicetoo
bad
schneider
got
hurt
he
reminds
me
of
chris
chelios
sometimes
speaking
of
chelios
i
wonder
if
serge
savard
feels
like
a
moron
for
making
that
trade
i
also
wish
we
still
had
corson
rob
ramage
on
the
ice
is
less
useful
than
a
gatorade
bottle
on
the
bench
vincent
damphousse
has
decided
to
take
a
vacation
apparently
i
have
no
idea
why
demers
is
playing
denis
savard
on
the
checking
line
with
carbonneau
savard
is
skating
well
and
is
one
of
the
only
dangerous
canadiens
in
quebecs
zone
with
the
puck
too
bad
nobody
is
in
front
most
of
the
time
do
you
also
notice
that
in
the
defensive
zone
not
a
single
nordique
gets
knocked
down
its
disgusting
we
also
have
lebeau
getting
pasted
at
centre
ice
by
wolaninn
with
no
reply
from
the
team
except
to
yell
for
a
penalty
dammit
denis
savard
threw
the
best
only
montreal
hit
of
the
night
when
he
knocked
sundin
offbalance
when
denis
savard
is
your
teams
enforcer
theres
big
trouble
someplace
hextall
made
some
good
saves
but
really
this
one
was
lost
in
first
period
when
nords
scored
could
have
had
plus
another
in
nd
aside
from
that
second
goal
roy
did
stand
on
his
head
the
third
period
at
least
provided
something
to
look
forward
to
habs
won
the
period
imo
and
i
guess
somebody
finally
came
along
to
smack
them
a
couple
of
times
in
the
second
intermission
to
remind
them
that
a
game
had
started
at
hopefully
they
play
that
way
at
home
roy
made
the
saves
well
ignore
that
second
goal
so
now
its
up
to
the
team
ps
to
all
those
grant
fuhr
doubtersbuffalo
boston
nuff
said
and
did
somebody
say
dale
hunter
was
a
playoff
choker
id
rethink
that
position
