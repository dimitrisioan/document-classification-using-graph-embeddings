i
mean
that
the
original
poster
was
looking
for
a
devils
victory
on
the
tape
delay
and
it
didnt
happen
in
game
i
was
the
original
poster
and
it
was
just
a
complaint
about
the
coverage
meaningless
yankee
game
before
playoff
devils
game
oh
i
apologize
theni
misinterpreted
you
no
problem
no
offence
taken
of
all
the
teams
in
the
patrick
i
least
dislike
the
devils
it
is
sad
just
as
a
lover
of
the
sport
that
this
team
can
be
in
the
metro
new
york
area
for
over
a
decade
and
still
exist
as
just
a
nonentity
how
is
espns
coverage
anyways
i
think
it
starts
tonight
were
getting
the
sabresbruins
as
the
replacement
game
and
probably
so
are
you
while
the
devilspenguins
game
is
played
on
scny
and
the
islanderscaps
are
the
overflow
game
on
the
sca
scny
plus
if
the
sabresbruins
ends
early
then
well
go
to
the
devilspenguins
game
assuming
that
espn
follows
their
previous
patterns
we
got
the
last
minute
of
the
islandersrangers
and
all
of
the
overtime
two
weeks
ago
espns
coverage
started
last
night
by
accident
but
as
one
or
more
other
writers
have
pointed
out
they
couldve
gone
to
wild
hog
wrestling
for
the
evening
instead
