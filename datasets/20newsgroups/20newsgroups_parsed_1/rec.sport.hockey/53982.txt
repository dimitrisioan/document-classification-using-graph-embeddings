last
year
the
pens
weak
spot
is
defense
and
goaltending
if
boston
boston
doesnt
have
the
guns
of
the
pens
but
the
pens
doesnt
have
the
defense
goaltending
and
discipline
of
boston
still
boston
can
why
do
you
say
this
as
of
now
the
pens
and
bruins
have
played
the
same
number
of
games
and
given
up
the
same
number
of
goals
they
are
tied
for
the
third
and
fourth
best
defenses
in
the
league
behind
chicago
first
and
toronto
second
the
pens
weak
spot
is
defense
only
by
comparison
to
their
offense
which
is
second
in
the
league
to
detroit
but
the
pens
are
no
weaker
on
defense
and
goaltending
than
the
bruins
are
that
is
they
are
both
very
strong
