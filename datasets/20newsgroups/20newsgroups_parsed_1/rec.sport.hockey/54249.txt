some
playoffs
thoughts
well
were
almost
halfway
through
the
first
round
and
so
far
things
are
good
in
general
the
teams
that
i
hate
most
chicago
and
basten
are
down
zip
even
though
there
is
a
possibility
either
can
still
win
their
series
yet
this
egothrashing
and
arrogancesmashing
by
the
underdogs
st
louis
and
buffalo
is
so
rewarding
montreal
is
at
this
stage
in
a
teams
life
where
they
are
not
good
enough
to
go
all
the
way
yet
too
good
to
be
able
to
get
some
really
good
draft
picks
is
it
just
me
or
does
anyone
out
there
also
think
that
this
year
the
cup
final
should
be
played
between
teams
from
the
wales
is
it
just
because
theyre
playing
montreal
that
i
find
the
diques
arrogant
s
or
are
they
really
smythewhat
im
really
getting
sick
of
seeing
douggie
and
wendel
night
in
and
night
out
we
should
see
some
canucksjetsflames
action
don
cherry
is
an
alright
but
hey
so
are
our
politicians
obleafsjoke
q
what
do
you
get
when
you
cross
a
maple
leaf
and
a
groundhog
a
six
more
weeks
of
crummy
hockey
lr
dudes
go
habs
gooooooooooooooooooo
