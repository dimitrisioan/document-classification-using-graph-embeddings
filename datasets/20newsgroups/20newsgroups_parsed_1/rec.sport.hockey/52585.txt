the
adams
division
race
is
certainly
interesting
this
year
here
are
important
data
to
keep
in
mind
in
the
eventuality
of
a
tie
for
a
given
standing
position
in
head
to
head
games
quebec
wins
over
montreal
boston
leads
against
quebec
with
two
games
remaining
montreal
and
boston
are
tied
with
one
game
remaining
pierre

aka

pierre
for
purposes
of
the
tie
breaker
you
only
count
the
first
three
games
in
each
city
therefore
quebec
can
not
possibly
be
ahead
of
montreal
and
theres
probably
only
one
game
that
counts
remaining
between
boston
and
quebec
which
means
boston
has
probably
already
won
