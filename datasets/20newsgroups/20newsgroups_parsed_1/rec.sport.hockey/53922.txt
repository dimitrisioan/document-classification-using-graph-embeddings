abc
coverage
i
loved
the
abc
coverage
the
production
was
excellent
the
appearance
was
excellent
it
had
a
sleek
modern
look
this
was
the
first
time
i
heard
thorne
clement
i
thought
they
were
great
my
only
request
is
to
leave
al
micheals
out
of
this
he
annoys
me
im
hoping
this
leads
to
a
regularseason
contract
my
guess
would
be
is
that
it
will
be
roughly
a
weekly
game
from
febapril
and
then
the
playoffs
i
envy
you
canadians
with
your
tsn
cbc
maybe
ill
get
a
dish
to
pick
up
canadian
tv
how
much
are
those
things
btw
