and
ill
give
fuhrs
new
one
an
honourable
mention
although
i
havent
seen
it
closely
yet
it
looked
good
from
a
distance
this
is
the
new
buffalo
one
the
second
since
hes
been
with
the
sabres
i
recall
a
price
tag
of
over
just
for
the
paint
job
on
that
mask
and
a
total
price
of
almost
ouch
yeah
its
the
second
one
and
i
believe
that
price
too
ive
been
trying
to
get
a
good
look
at
it
on
the
bruinsabre
telecasts
and
wow
does
it
ever
look
good
whoever
did
that
paint
job
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
given
fuhrs
play
since
he
got
it
i
bet
the
bruins
are
wishing
he
didnt
have
it
