bleep
bleep
the
bruins
lost
again
in
ot
i
cant
stand
it
aside
from
frustrated
ravings
i
must
give
buffalo
credit
they
are
making
good
on
most
of
their
scoring
opportunities
and
are
playing
great
defense
boston
players
cant
seem
to
get
control
of
the
puck
anywhere
near
the
buffalo
net
except
for
on
rare
occasions
the
buffalo
defense
is
also
doing
an
excellent
job
clearing
away
rebounds
fuhr
is
playing
great
when
the
big
save
is
needed
but
hes
also
getting
plenty
of
help
boston
has
been
playing
rather
well
better
than
would
be
indicated
by
the
series
score
of
but
is
lacking
that
extra
drive
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
game
as
a
result
boston
keeps
leaving
the
ice
at
the
end
of
the
st
period
goals
down
this
must
stop
if
boston
is
to
have
any
hope
of
winning
a
single
game
the
outlook
for
the
bruins
advancement
to
the
second
round
are
quite
bleak
imho
the
bruins
need
to
score
first
if
they
can
do
that
they
have
an
excellent
chance
of
winning
since
they
have
outplayed
the
sabres
in
the
nd
and
rd
periods
the
scary
thing
is
that
ill
be
going
to
grad
school
in
buffalo
next
year
ill
never
cheer
for
the
sabres
you
cant
convert
