too
many
europeans
in
nhl
ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
i
just
dont
want
them
on
mine
