the
detroit
red
wings
put
a
lot
of
doubter
on
ice
tonight
with
a
washing
of
the
toronto
maple
leafs
all
you
toronto
fans
have
now
seen
the
power
of
the
mighty
red
wing
offense
torontos
defense
in
no
match
for
the
wing
offense
as
for
the
defense
probert
kennedey
and
primeau
came
out
hitting
hard
toronto
players
were
being
thrown
left
and
right
not
even
wendell
clark
was
tough
enough
for
the
wings
tough
guys
the
wings
only
gave
up
three
goals
a
low
total
for
what
they
say
is
a
mediocre
defense
all
you
leaf
fans
better
speak
up
now
you
team
will
probable
have
its
season
ended
soon
wings
fans
keep
up
the
support
theres
quite
a
few
wings
fans
lurking
about
here
they
just
tend
to
be
low
key
and
thoughtful
rather
than
woofers
i
suppose
every
family
must
have
a
roger
clinton
though
but
remember
to
paraphrase
one
of
my
favorite
star
trek
lines
if
we
adopt
the
ways
of
the
leaf
fans
we
are
as
bad
as
the
leaf
fans
ron
and
one
of
my
major
goals
is
to
leave
the
next
president
a
new
set
of
things
to
worry
about
im
getting
bored
reading
the
same
problems
in
the
paper
decade
after
decade
i
want
people
to
have
to
deal
with
new
problems
president
bill
clinton
