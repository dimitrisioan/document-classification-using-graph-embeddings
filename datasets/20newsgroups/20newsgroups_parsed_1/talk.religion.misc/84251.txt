ah
so
you
admit
newborns
are
innocent
then
you
can
not
say
everyone
is
a
sinner
about
the
only
way
top
get
out
of
this
one
is
to
claim
that
a
newborn
is
a
sinner
despite
having
not
committed
any
sins
which
is
rather
odd
this
all
would
also
implicate
that
in
order
for
the
sinning
month
old
baby
to
get
forgivance
he
or
she
has
to
ask
for
help
from
jesus
