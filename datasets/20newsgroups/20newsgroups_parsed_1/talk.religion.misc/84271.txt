i
have
a
hard
time
just
now
understanding
that
christianity
knows
about
the
word
compassion
christians
do
you
think
the
actions
today
would
produce
a
good
picture
of
your
religion
surely
you
are
not
equating
david
koresh
with
christianity
the
two
are
not
comparable
this
is
always
an
option
when
the
sect
is
causing
harm
relabel
the
cult
to
something
else
