for
your
information
i
checked
the
library
of
congress
catalog
and
they
list
the
following
books
by
francis
hitching
i
believe
ive
just
discovered
an
anthopological
parallel
in
my
many
discussions
with
the
fundies
their
main
tactic
is
to
discredit
my
sources
they
shrilly
bleat
possibly
the
parallel
just
stems
from
your
tending
to
use
bad
sources
anyway
dont
you
think
that
similarity
is
rather
shallow
youre
only
looking
at
the
surface
at
the
way
of
argumentation
and
now
you
should
perhaps
go
a
little
deeper
and
try
to
find
the
difference
for
example
find
out
whether
you
can
find
real
science
done
by
hitching
if
you
cant
will
you
then
admit
that
your
attempt
at
quoting
an
authority
has
backfired
thomas
kettenring
dan
kaiserslautern
germany
johannes
scotus
eriugena
the
greatest
european
philosopher
of
the
th
century
said
that
if
reason
and
authority
conflict
reason
should
be
given
preference
and
if
that
doesnt
sound
reasonable
to
you
youll
just
have
to
accept
it
