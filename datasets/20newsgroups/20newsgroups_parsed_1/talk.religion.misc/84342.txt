got
it
in
one
similarly
a
moral
relativist
will
not
judge
one
moral
syste
to
be
better
than
another
in
every
possible
circumstance
this
does
not
however
preclude
him
from
judging
one
moral
system
to
be
better
than
anothe
in
a
specific
set
of
circumstances
nor
does
it
preclude
a
set
of
moral
relativists
from
collectively
judging
a
moral
system
from
some
set
of
circumstances
which
they
all
agree
they
are
in
ok
this
makes
sense
to
me
im
serious
youve
explained
something
to
me
which
i
never
understood
before
but
just
for
grins
suppose
we
almost
all
agree
that
we
are
in
a
set
of
circumstances
called
reality
what
then
then
we
all
live
happily
ever
after
seriously
if
we
all
agreed
on
the
circumstances
were
in
i
suspect
wed
all
agree
on
the
best
course
of
action
unfortunately
i
have
no
confidence
that
such
a
situation
will
ever
arise
some
of
us
think
theres
a
big
god
in
the
sky
some
dont
some
think
theyve
been
chosen
by
god
others
disagree
some
think
they
are
infallible
others
think
otherwise
until
those
disagreements
over
circumstances
can
be
ironed
out
theres
little
hope
of
everyone
agreeing
or
say
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
there
is
no
frame
of
reference
in
which
thus
and
such
is
good
isnt
that
approximately
objective
in
the
same
way
that
we
usually
expect
a
speeding
bullet
to
outrun
a
snail
yes
i
think
that
for
example
only
a
vanishingly
small
number
of
people
would
hold
that
theres
a
frame
of
reference
in
which
gassing
six
million
jews
is
good
so
thats
probably
about
as
close
to
an
objective
moral
value
as
ive
encountered
in
my
life
so
far
for
example
if
we
hear
of
a
bomb
in
a
crowded
area
isnt
it
a
rather
sensible
first
guess
that
this
is
an
immoral
act
even
though
there
conceivably
might
be
some
tailend
case
that
would
justify
it
well
i
think
your
examples
poor
if
the
bombs
in
iraq
for
example
and
was
dropped
by
an
american
plane
many
people
would
hold
that
it
was
a
moral
act
and
what
weasel
word
do
you
use
to
describe
that
frame
of
reference
if
it
isnt
an
objective
reality
for
values
im
sorry
i
cant
parse
an
objective
reality
for
values
could
you
tr
y
again
san
objective
reality
for
valuessome
values
are
real
even
in
the
face
of
disagreement
i
still
dont
quite
see
what
youre
trying
to
say
i
assume
by
values
you
mean
moral
values
yes
in
which
case
what
do
you
mean
by
real
what
is
a
real
moral
value
as
opposed
to
an
unreal
one
i
mean
to
say
that
values
are
as
real
as
horses
whatever
you
understand
by
a
horse
being
real
is
pretty
much
what
i
mean
about
a
value
being
real
hmm
so
these
moral
values
have
a
perceptible
physical
presence
if
you
are
saying
that
some
moral
systems
are
better
than
others
in
your
opinion
then
all
you
get
is
infinite
regress
sorry
but
in
what
way
is
it
an
infinite
regress
it
looks
extremely
finite
to
me
i
meant
that
its
never
more
than
your
opinion
right
and
the
chain
ends
right
there
the
buck
stops
with
me
its
not
an
infinite
regress
youve
clarified
this
for
me
above
my
understanding
is
now
that
if
a
supermajority
of
relativists
agree
that
thus
and
such
is
wrong
in
almost
any
or
all
frames
of
reference
then
theyre
saying
something
which
is
to
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
no
different
than
what
im
saying
right
the
key
point
however
is
that
there
are
vanishingly
few
of
these
moral
issues
where
we
can
get
of
people
to
agree
on
the
outcome
for
all
frames
of
reference
and
agree
on
the
frames
of
reference
what
you
do
not
get
is
any
justification
for
saying
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
sorry
but
thats
not
so
i
can
provide
a
justification
for
asserting
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
i
just
cant
provide
a
justification
which
works
in
all
possible
circumstances
logically
possible
or
actually
possible
i
cant
manage
either
killing
hitler
using
a
car
bomb
would
have
been
a
terrorist
act
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
couldnt
exactly
condemn
it
although
there
are
tricky
philosophical
issues
to
do
with
hindsight
by
which
i
mean
are
you
stretching
possible
to
include
events
such
as
the
atoms
in
my
terminal
switching
places
so
that
the
terminal
turns
upside
down
or
do
you
think
it
likely
that
circumstances
will
arise
in
which
terrorism
is
superior
to
peace
i
think
that
circumstances
have
already
arisen
where
terrorism
would
have
been
better
than
peace
better
in
terms
of
numbers
of
innocent
people
killed
assuming
it
was
successful
terrorism
of
course
