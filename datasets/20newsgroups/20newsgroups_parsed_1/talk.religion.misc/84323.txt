science
can

origins
for
a
person
to
exclude
anything
but
science
from
the
issue
of
origins
is
to
say
that
there
is
no
higher
truth
than
science
this
is
a
false

the
way
i

it

let
us
explore
this
interesting
paragraph
point
by
point
sentence
by
sentence
we
are
talking
about
origins
not
merely
science
origins
of
what
are
we
speaking
of
the
origins
of
life
the
human
species
the
universe
physical
law
biological
diversity
or
what
science
can
not
explain
origins
this
is
a
false
statement
unless
it
is
carefully
qualified
it
depends
on
what
origins
we
are
talking
about
for
a
person
to
exclude
anything
but
science
from
the
issue
of
origins
is
to
say
that
there
is
no
higher
truth
than
science
again
this
is
a
false
statement
to
begin
with
the
notion
of
higher
truth
is
distinctly
dubious
many
people
believe
that
there
are
ways
to
ascertain
truth
that
are
not
in
the
repetoire
of
science
they
even
believe
that
there
are
ways
that
are
more
reliable
and
certain
many
believe
that
there
are
truths
that
can
not
be
expressed
using
the
language
of
science
let
it
be
so
these
truths
are
neither
higher
or
lower
they
are
simply
true
more
to
the
point
restricting
ones
discussion
of
origins
to
science
does
not
reject
other
sources
of
knowledge
it
simply
restricts
the
scope
of
discussion
this
is
a
false
premise
if
this
is
intended
as
asserting
that
the
previous
sentence
was
false
then
is
actually
true
however
the
context
identifies
it
as
another
false
or
at
least
theologically
unsound
statement
by
the
way
i
enjoy
science
on
the
evidence
mr
rawlins
lacks
sufficient
understanding
of
science
to
enjoy
science
in
any
meaningful
sense
one
might
just
as
well
say
that
one
enjoys
literature
written
in
a
language
that
one
can
not
read
however
one
can
not
mark
this
sentence
as
false
to
follow
the
analogy
perhaps
he
likes
the
pretty
shapes
of
the
letters
it
is
truly
a
wonder
observing
gods
creation
let
us
not
quibble
count
this
one
as
true
macroevolution
is
a
mixture
of
percent
science
and
percent
religion
guaranteed
within
three
percent
error
still
another
false
statement
however
one
can
make
it
come
out
true
with
the
following
contextual
modification
macroevolution
as
misunderstood
by
rawline
is
a
mixture
of
percent
of
what
rawlins
erroneously
thinks
of
as
science
and
percent
of
what
rawlins
erroneously
thinks
of
as
religion
it
is
distinctly
noticeable
that
mr
rawlins
fails
miserably
to
touch
on
truth
except
when
he
reports
personally
on
what
he
feels
i
do
him
the
justice
of
assuming
that
he
is
not
misinforming
us
as
to
his
personal
reactions
one
can
account
for
this
by
the
hypothesis
that
he
has
an
idiosyncratic
and
personal
concept
of
truth
