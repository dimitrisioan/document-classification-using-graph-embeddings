for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
i
assume
you
have
evidence
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
again
id
like
to
see
some
evidence
nut
or
not
he
was
clearly
a
liar
he
said
he
would
surrender
after
local
radio
stations
broadcast
his
message
but
he
didnt
then
he
said
he
would
surrender
after
passover
but
he
didnt
the
rest
of
the
story
seems
to
be
that
the
agreement
for
the
broadcast
was
for
primetime
and
that
koresh
never
even
heard
it
played
wasnt
even
tuned
in
to
the
radio
when
it
aired
so
no
reason
to
come
out
if
later
they
had
given
him
a
copy
of
the
grossly
twisted
newswire
transcript
im
certain
koresh
would
think
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
evil
itself
as
to
coming
out
after
passover
wasnt
that
just
one
of
the
lawyers
speculations
