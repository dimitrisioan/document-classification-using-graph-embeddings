the

was
met
with

due
process
was
not

because

the
peaceful
attempt
to
serve
the
warrant
consisted
of
the
following
actions
in
order
batf
agents
forcing
their
entry
of
the
compound
through
second
story
windows
batf
agents
loosing
some
grenades
allegedly
stun
or
flash
grenades
which
promptly
detonated
after
which

exactly
how
is
it
that
someone
breaking
into
private
property
and
tossing
grenades
around
is
considered
peaceful
by
anyone
you
think
on
that
which
is
not

do
not
still
hold
my
previous
and
entirely
correct

about
