re
a
message
for
you
mr
president
how
do
you
know
what
happened
in
timothy
j
brent
writes
probably
not
but
then
i
dont
pack
heavy
weaponry
with
intent
to
use
it
please
cite
your
evidence
that
he
was
intending
to
use
it
you
dont
really
think
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
keep
that
stuff
do
you
why
not
if
so
tell
me
where
you
live
so
i
can
be
sure
to
steer
well
clear
check
the
sig
the
public
also
has
rights
and
they
should
be
placed
above
those
of
the
individual
society
does
not
have
rights
only
individuals
have
rights
go
ahead
call
me
a
commie
ok
your
a
commie
but
youd
be
singing
a
different
tune
if
i
exercised
my
right
to
rape
your
daughter
you
think
you
have
a
right
to
rape
anyone
no
wonder
you
dont
care
about
the
rightws
of
others
he
broke
the
law
please
indicate
which
law
you
feel
koresh
broke
and
when
was
he
convicted
of
said
crime
he
was
a
threat
to
society
so
you
feel
that
owning
guns
makes
him
a
threat
to
society
when
are
y
ou
going
to
start
going
after
knives
and
baseball
bats
as
well
or
do
you
feel
that
someone
who
spouts
unpopular
ideas
is
by
definition
a
threat
to
society
they
did
there
job
simple
it
is
simple
if
you
think
that
there
job
is
to
assualt
civilians
support
your
first
second
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
eighth
amendment
rights
lest
they
be
taken
away
from
you
just
as
the
fbi
did
to
the
davidians
think
about
it
ill
support
them
all
except
no
in
other
words
you
dont
support
any
of
them
mob
rule
isnt
any
prettier
merely
because
the
mob
calls
itself
a
government
it
aint
charity
if
you
are
using
someone
elses
money
wilsons
theory
of
relativity
if
you
go
back
far
enough
were
all
related
