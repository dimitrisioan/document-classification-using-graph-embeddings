rhoemer
was
the
name
of
the
guy
responsible
for
much
of
the
uniforms
and
props
used
by
the
early
nazis
in
their
rallies
and
such
the
name
is
roehm
not
rhoemer
and
hitler
does
claim
that
he
came
up
with
the
swastika
business
but
didnt
he
credit
the
actual
flag
design
to
a
party
member
some
dentist
or
other
i
believe
he
gives
such
credit
in
mein
kampf
he
was
killed
in
an
early
nazi
purge
he
and
many
of
his
associates
were
flaming
homosexuals
well
know
also
for
their
flamboyant
orgies
i
have
been
trying
to
find
if
there
is
any
actual
evidence
for
this
common
assertion
recently
postings
to
such
groups
as
sochistory
and
socculturegerman
has
not
uncovered
any
netexperts
who
could
provide
any
well
im
no
expert
but
all
of
the
histories
of
nazi
germany
assert
this
they
make
reference
to
several
scandals
that
occurred
long
before
the
night
of
the
long
knives
the
impression
that
i
got
was
that
homosexuality
in
portions
of
the
sa
was
common
knowledge
also
a
book
by
a
homosexual
author
whose
name
escapes
me
at
the
moment
called
homosexuals
in
history
asserts
that
roehm
and
heines
were
homosexuals
as
well
as
others
in
roehms
sa
circle
rest

anybody
out
in
