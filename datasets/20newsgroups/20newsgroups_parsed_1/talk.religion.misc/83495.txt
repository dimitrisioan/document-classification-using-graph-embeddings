please
clarify
you
state
that
proteins
did
not
form
randomly
that
seems
to
be
my
point
well
i
am
not
andy
but
if
you
had
familiarized
yourself
with
some
of
the
current
theorieshypotheses
about
abiogenesis
before
posting
you
would
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
none
of
them
claims
that
proteins
were
assembled
randomly
from
amino
acids
it
is
current
thinking
that
rna
based
replicators
came
before
proteinaceous
enzymes
and
that
proteins
were
assembled
by
some
kind
of
primitive
translation
machinery
