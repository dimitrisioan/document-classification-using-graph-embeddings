like
i
said
before
des
works
whether
i
value
my
privacy
or
not
ok
which
des
the
abstract
function
des
that
stops
working
in
any
important
sense
if
noone
cares
for
the
importance
of
truth
mathematics
meaning
information
etc
a
des
chip
or
des
sw
that
stops
working
in
any
important
sense
if
noone
values
science
objective
reality
etc
des
does
not
work
in
a
value
vacuum
nothing
else
does
either
this
is
just
truth
by
blatant
assertion
your
in
any
important
sense
seem
to
be
just
weasel
words
imagine
that
i
have
a
box
which
accepts
bytes
and
uses
the
first
to
ecb
the
second
it
still
does
a
perfect
job
of
desing
whether
or
not
any
input
is
being
made
at
the
timewhether
or
not
anyone
values
mathematics
if
noone
looks
at
the
results
or
acknowledges
their
correctness
in
what
meaningful
sense
can
the
chip
be
said
to
work
does
flibozity
exist
by
flibozity
i
mean
a
particular
extremely
complex
configuration
of
physical
phenomena
which
noone
absolutely
noone
cares
about
in
the
slightest
does
it
exist
eric
getting
back
to
the
question
of
whether
the
des
chip
works
doesnt
work
mean
something
like
achieving
the
desiredexpected
effect
note
the
way
intentionality
subtly
underlies
that
definition
even
if
we
take
the
definition
as
expected
instead
of
desired
can
you
deny
that
conformance
to
expectations
is
itself
a
value
of
sorts
namely
the
scientific
values
of
accuracyofprediction
and
reproducibilityofresults
the
phenomenologist
husserl
for
one
considered
intentionality
to
be
the
primary
ontological
stuff
from
which
all
other
ontology
was
built
perceptions
consciousness
thoughts
etc
frank
is
by
no
means
alone
in
seeing
intentionality
or
values
as
he
puts
it
underlying
all
human
experience
even
the
socalled
objective
experiences
such
as
measurements
of
the
natural
world
or
the
output
of
your
des
chip
