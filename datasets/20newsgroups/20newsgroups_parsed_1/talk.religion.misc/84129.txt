if
one
does
not
follow
the
teachings
of
christ
he
is
not
christian
too
easy
that
would
exclude
most
selfproclaimed
christians
do
you
follow
the
ten
commandments
as
a
matter
of
fact
yes
i
do
or
at
least
i
strive
to
i
will
not
be
so
proud
as
to
boast
that
my
faith
is
i
am
still
human
and
imperfect
and
therefore
liable
to
sin
thankfully
there
is
opportunity
for
repentence
and
forgiveness
god
be
with
you
malcolm
lee
it
sounds
like
youre
modifying
your
definition
of
christian
to
anyone
who
strives
to
follow
the
teachings
of
christ
do
i
read
you
correctly
and
just
what
constitutes
strive
did
jesus
say
this
and
define
just
what
striving
means
can
you
give
an
example
of
striving
that
is
insufficient
to
qualify
one
as
a
christian
and
thus
condemns
one
to
eternal
damnation
in
fiery
torture
do
you
selfproclaim
yourself
a
christian
and
if
so
on
what
basis
