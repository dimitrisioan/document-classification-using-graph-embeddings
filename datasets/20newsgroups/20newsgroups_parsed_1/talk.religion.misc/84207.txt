says
and
since
i
felt
reasonably
sure
of
myself
i
decided
to
start
analyzing
the
bible
very
closely
that
was
the
catalyst
to
my
break
with
my
faith
though
it
was
a
long
and
difficult
effort
brian
kendig
also
declares
christ
means
chosen
the
person
chosen
to
fulfill
the
prophesies
of
the
old
testament
and
bring
about
a
new
age
of
hope
and
spiritual
growth
for
mankind

greek
for
messiah
messiah

annoint
means
to
rub
with
oil
ie
to
anoint
by
impl
to
consecrate
the
major
prophet
daniel
uses
the
word
messiah
in
daniel
chapter
how
closely
did
you
analyze
the
bible
looks
as
if
you
didnt
get
past
the
first
word
so
was
the
catalyst
to
break
your
faith

priests
who
interpreted
the
bible
for
you
did

what
the
bereans
