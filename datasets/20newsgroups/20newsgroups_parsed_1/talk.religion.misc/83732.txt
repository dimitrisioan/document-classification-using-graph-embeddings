so
stop
dodging
the
question
what
is
hypocritical
about
my
criticizing
bad
arguments
given
that
i
do
this
both
when
i
agree
with
the
conclusion
and
when
i
disagree
with
the
conclusion
you
are
the
one
who
has
claimed
to
possess
the
fruits
of
precognition
telepathy
and
telempathy
divine
it
yourself
another
dodge
oh
well
im
no
match
for
your
amazing
repertoire
of
red
herrings
and
smoke
screens
you
asked
for
an
apology
im
not
going
to
apologize
for
pointing
out
that
your
strawman
argument
was
a
strawman
argument
nor
for
saying
that
your
list
of
bible
contradictions
shows
such
low
standards
of
scholarship
that
it
should
be
an
embarrassment
to
antiinerrantists
just
as
josh
mcdowell
should
be
an
embarrassment
to
the
fundies
nor
for
objecting
various
times
to
your
taking
quotes
out
of
context
nor
for
pointing
out
that
they
do
it
too
is
not
an
excuse
nor
for
calling
your
red
herrings
and
smoke
screens
what
they
are
how
about
the
following
inaccurate
unsubstantiated
accusations
in
jim
has
been
threatening
but
no
threat
produced
once
he
realized
that
display
of
telepathy
threatening
to
quote
me
in
spite
of
no
threat
produced
nor
forecast
ever
happening
precognition
responding
jims
threat
to
quote
me
in
spite
of
claimed
threat
never
being
given
jim
preparing
to
in
spite
of
it
never
happening
telepathy
or
precognition
jim
again
still
mystified
unsubstantiated
and
untrue
more
telepathy
or
maybe
telempathy
jim
still
scandalized
unsubstantiated
again
seems
to
be
a
habit
having
more
trouble
with
reality
it
appears
why
get
bothered
with
the
facts
when
you
appear
to
have
the
products
of
paranatural
divination
methods
