consider
your
mother
merlyn
you
know
your
mother
what
would
you
think
of
me
if
i
asserted
that
your
mother
is
feet
tall
murdered
your
father
and
sexually
abused
you
when
you
were
a
kid
i
would
just
go
fetch
my
parents
and
show
them
to
you
and
thereby
prove
quite
definitively
that
my
mother
is
not
named
merlyn
she
is
not
nine
feet
tall
and
my
father
is
quite
alive
then
i
would
assert
quite
simply
that
your
deity
does
not
exist
and
wait
for
a
similar
demonstration
from
you

kendig
je
ne
suis
fait
comme
aucun
de
ceux
que
jai
vus
jose

netre
fait
comme
aucun
de
ceux
qui
existent
the
meaning
of
life
si
je
ne
vaux
pas
mieux
au
moins
je
suis
autre
is
that
it
