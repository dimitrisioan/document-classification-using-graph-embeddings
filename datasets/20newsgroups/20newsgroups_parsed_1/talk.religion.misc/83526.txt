orders
tony
alicea
writes
in
a
previous
article
ba
davishowe
says
on
the
subject
of
how
many
competing
rc
orders
there
are
let
me
point
out
the
golden
dawn
is
only
the
outer
order
of
that
tradition
the
inner
order
is
the
roseae
rubeae
et
aurae
crucis
just
wondering
do
you
mean
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
warning
there
is
no
point
in
arguing
whos
legit
and
whos
not
which
golden
dawn
are
you
talking
about
no
i
dont
mean
the
lr
whatever
that
is
as
for
which
gd
im
using
the
complete
golden
dawn
system
of
magic
as
my
source
so
unless
regardie
is
lying
im
pulling
the
name
out
the
the
original
orders
rituals
the
multiple
modern
groups
are
part
of
why
i
through
in
the
comment
about
all
the
spinoffs
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
reflecting
no
affiliation
i
am
going
to
say
that
the
true
rosicrucian
order
is
the
fraternitas
rosae
crucis
in
quakertown
penn
as
a
member
of
the
religious
society
of
friends
my
membership
is
in
the
urbanachampaign
il
friends
meeting
i
find
that
amusingly
ironic
any
takers
not
mei
dont
want
to
belong
to
anything
which
runs
around
claiming
to
be
the
true
whatever
i
find
that
disgusting
enjoy
the
journey
branarthur
queer
peculiar
and
wyrd
closed
minds
dont
want
to
know
