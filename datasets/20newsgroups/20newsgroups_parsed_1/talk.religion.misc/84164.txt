asked
your

k
i
am
pleased
with
your
honesty
and
to
be
honest
as
well
i
believe
you
have
not
asked
my
god
to
come
to
you
why
do
i
say
this
because
that
would
contradict
your
religious
beliefs
therefore
you
feel
more
comfortable
simply
accusing
his
sincerity
so
you
will
not
have
to
critically
examine
your
religious
beliefs
