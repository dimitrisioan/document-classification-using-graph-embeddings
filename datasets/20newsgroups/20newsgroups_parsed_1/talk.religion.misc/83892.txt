christians
have
professed
for
more
than
years
the
nicene
gb
creed
a
statement
of
beliefs
drawn
from
the
truths
of
scripture
gb
that
was
officially
accepted
by
a
council
of
church
bishops
gb
and
leaders
at
nicea
in
ad
christians
still
recite
gb
this
creed
regularly
in
public
worship

so
prior
to
ad
there
were
no
christians
or
all
of
them
really
gb
believed
the
nicean
creed
even
before
it
was
formulated
do
you
gb
really
believe
such
an
absurdity

afraid
you
do
no
i
really
dont
honest
the
nicene
creed
as

mentioned
above
is
a
brief
statement
of
beliefs
that
are
derived
from
scripture
that
this
certain
list
did
not
exist
earlier
does
not
indicate
that
the
beliefs
summarized
in
in
did
not
exist
before
the
formula
was
derived
