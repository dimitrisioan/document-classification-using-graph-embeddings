after
years
can
we

b
i
am
neither
a
christian
nor
a
theist
but
i
believe
in
objective
morality
in
preference
to
a
relativist
soup
of
gobbledegook
well
there
are
two
approaches
we
can
take
here
one
is
to
ask
you
what
this
objective
morality
is
assuming
its
not
a
secret
the
other
is
to
ask
you
what
you
think
is
wrong
with
relativism
so
that
we
can
correct
your
misconceptions
