i
will
repeat
my
position
here
worshipping
on
sunday
has
never
been
a
sin
as
a
child
i
attended
services
on
saturday
and
sundayat
the
sda
church
and
at
the
pentecostal
church
across
the
street
i
might
even
go
to
a
baptist
church
next
week
i
worship
god
every
day
and
every
christian
should
even
if
we
can
prove
that
christians
should
meet
on
sunday
and
we
cant
we
can
never
prove
that
violation
of
the
sabbath
is
not
a
sin
any
longer
nor
can
we
prove
that
violation
of
sunday
is
a
sin
we
can
not
use
the
sabbath
commandment
for
that
purpose
my
online
bible
is
on
a
cd
but
i
dont
own
a
cdrom
system
for
the
time
being
so
i
cant
search
for
the
famous
cite
where
jesus
explicitly
states
that
he
didnt
want
to
break
existing
jewish
laws
in
other
words
technically
speaking
christians
should
use
saturday
and
not
sunday
as
their
holy
day
if
they
want
to
conform
to
the
teachings
of
jesus
