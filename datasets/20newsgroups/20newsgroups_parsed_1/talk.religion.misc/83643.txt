a
position
on
the
transcendental
plane
arjuna
as
a
student
and
friend
of
lord
krsna
is
advised
to
raise
himself
to
the
transcendental
position
of
vedanta
philosophy
where
in
the
beginning
there
is
brahmajijnasa
or
questions
on
the
supreme
transcendence
all
the
living
entities
who
are
in
the
material
world
are
struggling
very
hard
for

them
the
lord
after

the
material
world
gave
the
vedic
wisdom
advising
how
to
live
and
get
rid
of
the
material
entanglement
when
the
activities
for
sense
gratification
namely
the
karmakanda
chapter
are
finished
then
the
chance
for
spiritual
realization
is
offered
in
the
form
of
the
upanisads
which
are
part
of
different
vedas
as
the
bhagavadgita
is
a
part
of
the
fifth
veda
namely
the
mahabharata
the
upanisads
mark
the
beginning
of
transcendental
life
as
long
as
the
material
body
exists
there
are
actions
and
reactions
in
the
material
modes
one
has
to
learn
tolerance
in
the
face
of
dualities
such
as
happiness
and
distress
or
cold
and
warmth
and
by
tolerating
such
dualities
become
free
from
anxieties
regarding
gain
and
loss
this
transcendental
position
is
achieved
in
full
krsna
consciousness
when
one
is
fully
dependent
on
the
good
will
of
krsna
