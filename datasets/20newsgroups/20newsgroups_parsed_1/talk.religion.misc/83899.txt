these
laws
written
for
the
israelites
gods
chosen
people
whom
god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
jews
wont
agree
with
you
malcolm
cheers
kent
alink
ksand
private
activities
on
the
net
a
lot
of
people
wont
agree
with
me
thats
their
right
and
i
respect
that
however
to
the
point
jews
are
also
covered
by
the
saving
grace
of
jesus
christ
there
are
jews
who
have
become
christians
this
brings
up
another
question
i
still
have
to
ponder
why
is
there
so
much
antisemitism
why
do
people
hate
jews
i
dont
hate
jews
i
consider
them
to
be
like
anyone
else
sinners
we
all
are
