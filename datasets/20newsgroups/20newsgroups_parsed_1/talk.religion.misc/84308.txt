firstly
science
has
its
basis
in
values
not
the
other
way
round
so
you
better
explain
what
objective
atoms
are
and
how
we
get
them
from
subjective
values
before
we
go
any
further
atoms
are
not
objective
they
arent
even
real
what
scientists
call
an
atom
is
nothing
more
than
a
mathematical
model
that
describes
certain
physical
observable
properties
of
our
surroundings
all
of
which
is
subjective
omigod
its
an
operationalist
sorry
jim
but
the
idea
that
a
theory
explaining
a
myriad
of
distinctly
different
observations
is
merely
a
model
is
more
than
sensible

phobia
about
objective
reality
notwithstanding
mark

any
resemblance
between
my
opinions
and
those
of
wolfram
research
inc
is
purely
coincidental
