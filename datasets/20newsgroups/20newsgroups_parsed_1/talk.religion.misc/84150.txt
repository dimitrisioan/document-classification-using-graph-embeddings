re
a
message
for
you
mr
president
how
do
you
know
what
happened
in
article

writes
they
used
a
tank
to
knock
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
they
released
nontoxic
nonflammable
tear
gas
into
the
building
how
do
you
know
were
you
there
while
obviously
koresh
was
a
nut
case
the
typical
inability
of
the
governmentmedia
to
get
its
story
straight
is
quite
disturbing
on
tuesday
night
nbc
news
reported
that
the
fbi
did
not
know
the
place
was
burning
down
until
they
saw
black
smoke
billowing
from
the
building
the
next
day
fbi
agents
were
insisting
that
they
saw
davidians
setting
the
fire
the
fbi
was
also
adamantly
denying
that
it
was
possible
their
battery
of
the
compounds
wallks
could
have
accidentally
set
the
blaze
while
also
saying
they
hadnt
been
able
to
do
much
investigating
of
the
site
because
it
was
still
too
hot
so
how
did
they
know
they
didnt
accidentally
set
the
fire
sounds
like
the
fbi
just
burned
the
place
to
the
ground
to
destroy
evidence
to
me
legalize
freedom
