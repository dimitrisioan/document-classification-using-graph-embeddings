one
way
or

so
much
for
patience
too
bad
you
couldnt
just
wait
was
the
prospect
of
gods
message
just
too
much
to
take
so
you
believe
that
david
koresh
really
is
jesus
christ
they
cut
off
the
water
there
were
no
fire
trucks
present
and
the
fbiatf
go
blasting
holes
into
the
builing
and
firing
gas
munitions
the
building
burns
almost
everyone
dies
it
probably
doesnt
bother
you
much
but
it
bothers
many
other
peoplemost
of
whom
dont
believe
particularly
in
koresh
or
his
message
four
atf
agents
and
branch
davidians
are
now
dead
because
of
crazy
tactics
on
the
part
of
the
atf
and
fbi
attorney
general
vampira
tells
us
that
todays
events
were
suppose
to
save
those
in
the
compound
blowing
holes
in
a
building
and
gassing
those
inside
was
supposed
to
save
them
personally
i
think
it
was
mrs
olearys
cow
that
knocked
over
that
lantern
phaedrus
the
cyberpyrate
