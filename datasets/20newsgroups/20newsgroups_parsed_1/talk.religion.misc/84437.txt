writes
for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
other
than
it
tells
quite
a
lot
about
the
man
himself
im
curious
are
you
referring
to
koresh
as
the
man
why
the
upper
case
m
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
are
you
the
spokesman
for
most
people
i
never
claimed
to
be
a
spokesman
for
most
people
it
is
an
assumption
on
my
part
that
people
with
normal
values
and
morality
would
be
more
concerned
with
human
life
than
sermon
structure
you
missed
the
point
which
is
that
the
prophets
the
psalms
and
revelation
all
together
provide
a
very
rich
view
of
a
very
special
event
a
wedding
are
burning
children
part
of
this
very
special
event
my
comment
stems
from
the
realization
that
we
who
love
the
lord
are
human
and
imperfect
whatever
we
preach
no
matter
how
eloquent
or
how
corrupted
is
of
little
difference
those
who
know
the
masters
voice
will
recognize
him
a
gemstone
amidst
rock
such
is
also
the
lesson
of
the
stumblingblock
for
those
who
have
an
ear
to
hear
what
about
those
who
do
not
know
the
masters
voice
does
the
master
not
care
about
them
eloquent
but
corrupt
preaching
may
be
of
little
difference
to
you
but
i
suspect
it
made
a
big
difference
to
all
of
those
who
died

the
