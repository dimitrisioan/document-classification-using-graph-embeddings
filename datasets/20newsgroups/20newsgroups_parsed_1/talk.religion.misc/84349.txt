re
burden
of
proof

article

i
saw
one
theist
on
this
net
talking
about
the
absurdity
of
one
saying
he
doesnt
believe
in
god
and
how
can
we
be
sure
the
problem
with
this
and
other
arguments
assumes
that
the
burden
of
proof
lies
with
the
atheist
wrong
in
philosophy
the
one
who
is
making
a
positive
argument
must
give
reasons
for
his
believing
so
not
the
negative
if
i
were
to
make
the
statement
elves
exist
then
it
would
be
up
to
me
to
prove
my
positive
assertion
not
the
person
saying
that
elves
dont
exist
if
the
negative
in
this
case
had
to
prove
elves
dont
exist
he
would
have
to
omniscient
and
know
every
inch
of
the
universe
the
same
applies
with
god
give
me
your
reasons
and
you
the
theist
make
the
case
i
think
you
have
are
addressing
the
wrong
issue
the
situation
is
more
like
we
both
see
some
elves
this
is
established
as
fact
since
we
can
both
touch
them
etc
then
one
of
us
says
the
elves
have
always
been
with
us
the
other
says
no
no
there
was
a
time
before
elves
were
here
which
is
the
positive
argument
