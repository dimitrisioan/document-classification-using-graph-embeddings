so
we
have
this
highly
christian
religious
order
that
put
fire
on
their
house
killing
most
of
the
people
inside
we
have
no
way
to
know
that
the
cultists
burned
the
house
it
could
have
been
the
batf
and
fbi
we
only
have
the
governments
word
for
it
after
all
and
people
who
started
it
by
a
noknock
search
with
concussion
grenades
are
hardly
disinterested
observers
theres
another
point
to
be
made
those
who
have
been
inside
burning
houses
know
that
if
they
want
to
stay
alive
its
better
to
run
out
from
the
building
we
had
one
case
where
an
fbi
agent
had
to
drag
out
a
women
from
the
burning
house
she
run
back
in
when
she
saw
the
forces
arriving
it
is
a
good
indication
of
the
fanatical
mind
that
the
followers
had
including
having
they
children
burned
instead
of
saving
these
innocent
victims
of
the
