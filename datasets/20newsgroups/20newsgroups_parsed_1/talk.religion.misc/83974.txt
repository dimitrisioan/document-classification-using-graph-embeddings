writes
for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
i
assume
you
have
evidence
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
deaths
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
again
id
like
to
see
some
evidence
ill
type
this
very
slowly
so
that
you
can
understand
he
either
set
the
fire
himself
or
told
his
followers
to
do
so
dont
make
him
out
to
be
a
martyr
he
did
not
get
killed
he
killed
himself
once
again
wheres
your
proof
suicide
is
considered
a
sin
by
branch
davidians
also
koresh
said
over
and
over
again
that
he
was
not
going
to
commit
suicide
furthermore
all
the
cult
experts
said
that
he
was
not
suicidal
david
thibedeau
sp
one
of
the
cult
members
said
that
the
fire
was
started
when
one
of
the
tanks
spraying
the
tear
gas
into
the
facilities
knocked
over
a
lantern
the
evil
was
inside
the
compound
evidence
please
all
that
thou
shalt
not
kill
stuff
id
like
to
point
out
that
the
bible
says
do
not
commit
murder
the
nkj
translation
mistranslates
selfdefense
was
never
considered
murder
the
reason
why
they
were
stockpiling
weapons
is
because
they
were
afraid
the
government
would
try
something
their
fears
were
obviously
well
founded
ray
cote
theres
no
government
like
no
government
