because
of
course
that
possibility
existed
meaning
any
student
who
really
gave
a
shit
could
have
a
moment
of
silence
on
hisher
own
which
makes
more
sense
than
forcing
those
who
dont
want
to
participate
to
have
to
take
part
what
other
reason
is
there
for
an
organized
moment
of
silence
a
moment
of
silence
doesnt
mean
much
unless
everyone
participates
otherwise
its
not
silent
now
is
it
the
whole
point
is
maybe
everyone
doesnt
want
to
participate
and
maybe
they
do
but
without
somebody
to
set
the
time
that
doesnt
do
them
any
good
humph
deleted
there
was
my
list
of
nonreligious
reasons
one
might
want
a
moment
of
silence
for
a
dead
classmate
maybe
everyone
doesnt
want
to
be
silent
for
teachers
to
give
their
pompous
nonreligious
speeches
in
assembly
i
know
i
didnt
so
blindly
opposing
everything
with
a
flavor
of
religion
in
it
is
utterly
idiotic
blindly
opposing
everything
with
a
flavor
of
religion
in
it
that
is
supported
by
taxpayer
money
is
the
only
way
to
keep
christianity
from
becoming
the
official
us
religion
please
provide
documentation
that
opposing
only
things
that
are
actively
religious
eg
actual
prayer
amen
after
a
moment
of
silence
mandatory
classes
in
religion
and
not
things
that
have
possible
but
uncertain
religious
implications
eg
moments
of
silence
having
the
bible
on
the
shelves
during
reading
period
is
not
a
way
to
prevent
a
state
religion
prochoice
