question

why
would
it
be
immoral
to
hurt
someone
else
me
because
you
wouldnt
want
it
to
happen
to
you
hudson
why
does
that
make
something
immoral
because
you
are
not
being
consistent
moral
systems
must
be
consistent
a
person
who
thinks
they
can
inflict
pain
on
others
but
doesnt
want
it
inflicted
upon
themselves
has
a
double
standard
and
double
standards
are
a
violation
of
any
moral
system
me
morality
defines
how
we
interact
with
other
people
the
rules
that
we
use
to
guide
our
daily
affairs
our
conduct
towards
our
fellow
man
by
realizing
that
we
dont
like
pain
we
can
also
realize
that
other
people
dont
like
it
either
hudson
of
course
we
dont
like
pain
i
dont
like
brussel
sprouts
are
brussel
sprouts
immoral
pain
isnt
immoral
stupid
pain
itself
is
just
a
physiological
reaction
what
is
immoral
is
subjecting
unwilling
individuals
to
pain
or
brussel
sprouts
for
that
matter
hudson
is
it
immoral
to
produce
these
same
chemical
reactions
in
a
test
tube
me
it
isnt
the
chemical
reaction
that
is
wrong
bozo
its
making
the
human
being
undergo
the
effects
of
the
chemical
reaction
sorry
your
cute
little
analogy
didnt
survive
for
very
long
under
scrutiny
hudson
why
would
it
be
wrong
to
make
humans
undergo
the
effects
of
the
reactions
if
humans
are
composed
only
of
matter
what
humans
are
composed
of
isnt
the
qualifying
criteria
of
whether
or
not
something
would
be
wrong
hudson
is
it
wrong
to
make
matter
undergo
chemical
reactions
yes
if
it
is
sentient
matter
me
nature
is
not
a
sentient
force
there
is
no
choice
involved
therefore
no
question
of
morality
hudson
i
actually
heard
a
geologist
entertain
the
notion
that
matter
had
a
will
there
is
some
sentient
force
out
there
fine
i
have
also
heard
that
the
government
is
encoding
the
dna
for
a
new
race
of
superhumans
in
ordinary
drinking
water
whats
your
point
hudson
if
humans
are
made
only
of
matter
then
choices
are
also
chemical
reactions
so
why
is
choice
an
important
issue
and
if
that
is
the
case
then
god
is
only
an
idea
contained
in
the
minds
of
people
formed
of
matter
and
on
printed
pages
also
formed
of
matter
and
does
not
really
exist
i
can
do
the
argumentem
ad
absurdium
just
as
well
as
you
can
but
it
wont
prove
any
points
for
you
or
me
got
anything
relevant
you
want
to
talk
about
or
are
you
just
playing
cute
little
games
