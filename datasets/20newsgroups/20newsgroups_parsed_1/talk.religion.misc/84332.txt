yeah
in
a
fire
that
reportedly
burned
hotter
than
degrees
hot
enough
to
make
the
bodies
still
unidentifiable
the
authorities
found
a
gun
that
was
recognizably
fullyautomatic
and
state
of
the
art
isnt
that
conveeeenient
convenient
it
seems
very
appropriate
that
this
is
crossposted
to
altconspiracy
assuming
the
most
favorable
interpretation
of
your
degree
measurement
that
the
temperature
is
in
centigrade
rather
than
the
more
common
in
the
us
fahrenheit
you
are
still
laboring
under
at
least
misconceptions
you
seem
to
believe
that
steel
melts
somewhere
around
c
actually
the
melting
point
of
most
iron
alloys
and
steels
are
iron
alloys
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
c
even
if
the
gun
were
found
in
area
which
achieved
the
c
temperature
the
steel
parts
of
the
gun
would
not
be
deformed
and
it
would
still
be
trivial
to
identify
the
nature
of
the
weapon
a
fire
is
not
an
isothermal
process
there
are
hot
spots
and
cold
spots
though
cold
is
purely
a
relative
term
so
the
weapon
was
not
necessarily
situated
in
a
hot
spot
as
you
seem
to
imply
and
even
if
it
was
so
what
it
would
not
have
melted
anyway
