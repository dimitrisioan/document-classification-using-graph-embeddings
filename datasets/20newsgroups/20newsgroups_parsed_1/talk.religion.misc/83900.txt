david
joslin
writes
for
those
missing
the
context
of
this
thrilling
discussion
between
jim
and
i
jim
wrote
the
following
to
me
in
email
after
i
pointed
out
hate
to
shatter
your
self
image
of
perfection
that
you
appear
to
hold
but
your
language
is
wrong
jim
and
me
i
pointed
out
that
i
did
in
fact
agree
that
both
robert
weiss
and
jim
meritt
took
quotes
out
of
context
hence
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
jim
thinks
i
am
a
hypocrite
needless
to
say
i
dont
have
time
to
reply
to
every
article
on
trm
that
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
of
course
not
just
the
ones
you
disagree
with
qed
so
according
to
you
jim
the
only
way
to
criticize
one
person
for
taking
a
quote
out
of
context
without
being
a
hypocrite
is
to
post
a
response
to
every
person
on
trm
who
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
jim
replied
by
saying
did
i
either
ask
or
assert
that
but
today
we
find
four
articles
from
jim
one
of
which
has
the
subject
so
as
of
then
and
pointing
out
a
specific
instance
wrongo
again
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
when
someone
is
aware
of
something
and
has
the
capability
of
taking
action
and
does
not
that
individual
may
be
held
responsible
for
that
action
which
is
of
course
a
complete
red
herring
taking
quotes
out
of
context
isnt
a
crime
i
dont
have
time
to
read
every
article
on
trm
and
im
certainly
under
no
obligation
to
reply
to
them
all
so
check
the
newsgroups
does
silence
is
concurrence
imply
that
jim
thinks
that
because
i
didnt
respond
to
weiss
articles
i
must
condone
weiss
taking
quotes
out
of
context
jim
doesnt
want
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
this
question
read
what
he
has
written
and
decide
for
yourself
telepathy
again
you
claim
to
know
what
i
want
but
back
to
the
context
of
my
conversation
with
jim
jims
next
gambit
was
to
claim
that
he
was
using
inductive
logic
when
he
concluded
that
i
was
being
a
hypocrite
i
challenged
him
to
provide
the
details
of
that
logic
that
led
him
to
an
incorrect
conclusion
no
you
asked
specifically
what
was
wrong
with
yours
today
we
find
another
obscure
article
posting
it
twice
didnt
help
maybe
to
the
ignorant
i
accept
your
classification
more
red
herrings
could
jim
mean
that
he
has
read
an
uncountably
large
number
of
my
articles
do
you
know
what
uncountably
large
means
it
does
not
appear
so
could
jim
mean
that
because
i
axed
his
articles
but
not
weiss
articles
he
wants
to
conclude
inductively
well
i
cant
see
where
he
is
going
with
this
i
am
not
suprised
but
i
can
help
him
with
his
induction
ive
written
roughly
that
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case
the
appearance
of
your
argument
is
more
like
that
captain
kirk
would
have
gotten
from
mr
spock
written
by
a
stagehand
at
paramount
think
hard
about
this
jim
see
the
pattern
think
harder
run
it
through
your
induction
engine
and
see
what
pops
out
of
course
you
appear
arrogant
so
i
already
had
figured
that
out
