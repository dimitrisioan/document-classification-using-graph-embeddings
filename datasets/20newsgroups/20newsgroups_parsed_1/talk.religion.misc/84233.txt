re
after
years
can
we
say
that
christian
morality

ive
seen
referrences
to
creation
vs
evolution
several
times
in
aa
and
i
have
question
is
either
point
of
view
derived
from
direct
observation
can
either
be
scientific
i
wonder
if
the
whole
controversy
is
more
concerned
with
the
consequences
of
the
truth
rather
than
the
truth
itself
both
sides
seem
to
hold
to
a
philosophical
outcome
and
i
cant
help
wondering
which
came
first
as
ive
pointed
out
elsewhere
my
view
of
human
nature
makes
me
believe
that
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
anyhthing
objectively
all
knowledge
is
inherently
subjective
so
in
the
context
of
aa
would
you
take
a
stand
based
on
what
you
actually
know
to
be
true
or
on
what
you
want
to
be
true
and
how
can
you
tell
the
difference
translation
of
the
above
paragraph
i
am
uninformed
about
the
evidence
for
evolution
please

germany
johannes
scotus
eriugena
the
greatest
european
philosopher
of
the
th
century
said
that
if
reason
and
authority
conflict
reason
should
be
given
preference
and
if
that
doesnt
sound
reasonable
to
you
youll
just
have
to
accept
it
