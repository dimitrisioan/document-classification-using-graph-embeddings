it
seems
faith
is
the
only
tool
available
for
emotional
purposes
due
to
the
tragedy
as
such
it
maybe
fills
a
need
however
im
getting
tired
to
see
children
dying
in
pain
in
sudan
due
to
lack
of
food
and
assuming
that
god
takes
these
sufferers
to
heaven
after
a
painful
death
if
the
children
are
not
being
fed
whose
fault
is
that
you
and
i
have
plenty
of
food
on
our
tables
while
others
starve
why
is
that
god
gave
us
this
earth
to
manage
i
dont
think
were
doing
a
very
good
job
of
it
the
only
consolation
i
have
for
those
suffering
children
is
that
they
will
be
received
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
where
they
will
never
thirst
and
never
hunger
again
i
agree
with
your
points
and
im
glad
to
hear
that
you
subscribe
to
the
notion
of
secular
humanism
humans
helping
humans
instead
of
hoping
for
a
possible
deux
ex
machina
solution
as
for
faith
you
could
always
use
such
constructs
to
dampen
your
anger
or
sorrow
