moral
driver
distinctions
deleted
in
this
case
the
driver
does
not
evolve
but
simply
is
there
would
probably
not
be
any
manifestation
in
an
infant
because
the
moral
code
has
not
been
learnt
yet
ie
the
object
upon
which
the
driver
acts
upon
without
manifestation
though
how
can
the
driver
be
detected
for
all
purposes
it
seems
not
to
exist
until
moral
coding
begins
actually
i
agree
with
your
notion
of
a
driver
except
that
i
think
its
not
moral
but
pre
and
supermoral
it
is
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
this
thread
a
primal
sense
of
connection
a
pre
and
postnatal
umbilical
the
awareness
of
which
is
expressed
in
a
partial
fragmented
way
that
accomodates
and
forms
in
return
the
language
and
customs
of
a
given
culture
this
halting
pidginenglish
expression
is
i
think
what
we
come
to
call
morality
compare
the
driver
to
an
urge
such
as
jealousy
where
there
is
an
urge
and
an
object
the
jealousy
does
not
technically
exist
until
the
object
is
apparent
however
the
capacity
to
be
jealous
is
presumably
still
there
even
though
it
is
not
detectable
your
description
of
the
unbilical
took
me
three
passes
to
understand
but
i
get
the
gist
and
i
have
to
tentatively
agree
i
think
our
two
definitions
can
sit
side
by
side
without
too
much
trouble
though
i
havent
attempted
to
define
the
reason
behind
the
moral
driver
only
hinted
through
the
essence
of
each
moral
your
definition
hints
that
animals
are
also
capable
of
a
similar
morality
simians
have
a
similar
social
order
to
ourselves
and
it
is
easy
to
anthropomorphize
with
these
animals
is
this
possible
or
have
i
misunderstood
if
my
suggestion
holds
true
then
this
is
the
area
where
work
must
be
carried
out
to
prevent
a
moral
deterioration
of
society
what
kind
of
work
exactly
well
here
you
have
asked
the
big
question
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
that
you
were
hoping
i
would
say
something
really
contentious
in
this
reply
from
your
final
question
no
not
at
all
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
subscribed
to
some
particular
school
of
psychosocial
thought
and
rehabilitation
and
if
perhaps
you
had
a
plan
id
have
been
interested
to
hear
it
my
ps
thoughts
falls
roughly
in
line
with
john
stuart
mill
and
his
writings
on
utilitarianism
i
have
no
particular
plan
except
to
do
my
bit
personal
ethics
and
social
work
my
opinion
for
what
it
is
worth
is
that
the
authority
for
each
moral
must
be
increased
somehow
and
that
this
will
probably
take
several
generations
to
be
effective
i
dont
think
that
the
list
of
morals
has
changed
for
society
significantly
though
the
authority
element
may
come
from
our
authority
figures
and
roles
models
see
eric
berne
and
his
transactional
analysis
work
mavis
klein
for
references
and
this
is
what
gives
rise
to
a
deterioration
of
moral
standards
in
the
long
term
ive
had
some
more
thoughts
on
my
definitions
ive
was
thinking
that
i
should
add
moral
character
to
the
list
of
definitions
in
order
to
get
a
dynamic
version
of
the
moral
nature
ie
the
interplay
of
the
moral
code
and
associated
authorities
a
suitable
analogy
might
be
a
graphic
equaliser
on
a
hifi
system
the
moral
nature
being
the
set
of
frequencies
and
the
chosen
amplitudes
and
the
moral
character
being
the
spectrum
over
time
conscience
is
a
little
more
difficult
because
i
cant
define
it
as
the
reasoning
of
a
person
between
actions
in
the
context
of
his
moral
nature
because
conscience
seems
to
cut
in
most
of
the
time
unbidden
and
often
unwanted
i
think
conscience
is
manifest
when
a
decision
is
made
at
a
given
time
which
compromises
ones
moral
nature
my
conscience
fits
in
more
with
freuds
superego
plus
the
moral
driver
with
the
stimulous
being
the
urges
or
freuds
id
the
reasoning
that
i
mentioned
before
is
freuds
ego
i
suppose
if
the
moral
driver
is
part
of
the
id
then
the
reason
why
conscience
cuts
in
unbidden
is
partially
explained
the
question
is
what
provides
the
stimulous
to
activate
the
moral
driver
i
think
i
need
some
more
time
with
this
one
thats
about
it
for
now
david
on
religion
oh
where
is
the
sea

fishes

as
they
