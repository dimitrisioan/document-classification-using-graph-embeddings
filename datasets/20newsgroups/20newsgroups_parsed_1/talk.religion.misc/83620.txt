good
question
my
point
was
that
a
world
with
truth
is
better
than
a
world
with
falsehood
a
world
in
which
it
were
possible
to
say
yes
i
am
holding
a
jew
the
truth
and
you
me
the
jew
and
the
ss
guy
all
sit
down
to
crack
open
a
bottle
of
whiskey
is
better
than
the
grim
alternatives
you
present
obviously
this
is
not
possible
and
the
best
alternative
seems
to
be
to
lie
thats
because
other
values
are
involved
such
as
life
now
that
is
just
my
opinion
dont
confuse
the
claim
objective
morality
exists
with
the
claim
i
have
a
lock
on
morals
i
think
that
at
this
point
it
would
actually
be
quite
easy
to
confuse
objective
morality
with
relative
morality
jon
actually
jon
that
is
quite
true
christian
people
have
caused
objective
morality
to
look
very
relative
after
all
that
was
the
point
of
the
original
question
in
this
thread
ie
can
we
toss
out
christianity
because
it
is
so
obviously
inconsistent
with
its
own
principles
if
you
will
bear
with
me
i
will
attempt
to
explain
this
apparent
inconsistency
from
at
least
one
christians
viewpoint
if
god
exists
and
is
the
creator
of
mankind
as
the
bible
claims
then
he
has
a
pretty
welldefined
concept
of
what
makes
people
tick
physically
emotionally
etc
god
has
an
objective
morality
for
us
that
is
to
say
he
has
no
trouble
understanding
what
is
good
for
or
detrimental
to
the
creature
he
created
galatians
for
we
mankind
are
his
workmanship
created
in
christ
jesus
for
good
works
a
morality
which
god
prepared
beforehand
a
welldefined
design
that
we
might
walk
in
them
however
contrary
to
what
many
people
assume
including
the
pharasees
of
the
bible
gods
morality
can
not
be
completely
codified
in
a
list
of
rules
and
regulations
to
some
extent
every
activity
of
a
persons
life
creates
a
new
situation
to
which
morality
must
be
applied
there
never
could
be
enough
volumes
to
codify
gods
objective
morality
for
us
throughout
history
mankind
has
tried
to
reduce
morality
to
a
list
of
rules
objectivity
if
you
please
in
the
old
testament
we
have
both
principles
and
specific
rules
by
the
time
of
jesus
most
of
the
principles
were
obscured
by
the
emphasis
men
had
placed
on
the
rules
volumes
of
additional
rules
had
been
made
to
try
to
codify
the
application
of
the
principles
we
mankind
werent
comfortable
with
the
subjectivity
of
principles
for
reference
see
matthew
where
jesus
explains
the
difference
between
the
law
and
the
principles
of
the
law
for
example
in
verses
you
have
heard
that
the
ancients
were
told
you
shall
not
commit
murderand
whoever
commits
murder
shall
be
liable
to
the
court
but
i
say
to
you
that
everyone
who
is
angry
with
his
brother
shall
be
liable
to
the
court
the
objective
morality
of
god
gets
blurred
by
our
inept
interpretation
of
it
we
christians
have
made
our
biggest
errors
when
we
have
allowed
any
one
person
or
group
of
people
decide
exactly
what
god
intended
for
us
if
we
christians
would
stay
committed
to
seeking
gods
will
instead
of
trying
to
prove
we
already
had
it
all
figured
out
we
might
do
a
better
job
of
allowing
others
to
find
gods
objective
morality
for
themselves
if
jesus
is
who
he
said
he
wasis
and
thats
the
fundamental
question
then
he
is
objective
morality
