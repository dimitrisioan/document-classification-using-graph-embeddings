re
theists
and
objectivity
stephen

writes
can
a
theist
be
truly
objective
can
he
be
impartial
when
questioning
the
truth
of
his
scriptures
or
will
he
assume
the
superstition
of
his
parents
when
questioning
i
think
that
if
a
theist
were
truly
objective
and
throws
out
the
notion
that
god
definitely
exists
and
starts
from
scratch
to
prove
to
themselves
that
the
scriptures
are
the
whole
truth
then
that
person
would
no
longer
be
a
theist
it
usually
all
has
to
do
with
how
the
child
is
brought
up
from
the
time
he
is
born
the
theist
is
brought
up
with
the
notion
of
the
truth
of
some
kind
of
scripture
the
bible
the
torah
the
quran
etc
he
is
told
of
this
wondrous
god
who
wrote
or
inspired
the
scripture
of
the
prophets
talked
about
in
the
scripture
of
the
miracles
performed
etc
he
is
also
told
that
to
question
this
as
children
are
apt
to
do
is
a
sin
a
crime
against
god
and
to
lose
belief
in
the
scrip
tures
truth
is
to
damn
ones
soul
to
hell
thus
by
the
time
he
is
able
to
read
the
scripture
for
himself
the
belief
in
its
truth
is
so
ingrained
in
his
mind
it
all
seems
a
matter
of
course
youre
missing
something
here
there
are
people
who
convert
from
nontheism
to
theism
after
being
brought
up
in
a
nontheist
household
i
dont
have
any
statistics
as
to
how
many
though
that
would
be
an
interesting
thing
to
know
i
think
that
religion
is
a
crutch
people
are
naturally
afraid
of
the
unknown
and
the
unexplainable
people
dont
want
to
believe
that
when
they
die
they
are
dead
finished
that
there
is
nothing
else
after
that
and
so
religion
is
kind
of
a
nice
fantasy
religion
also
describes
things
we
dont
know
about
the
universe
things
science
has
not
yet
described
and
it
also
gives
people
a
feeling
of
security
that
if
they
just
do
this
one
thing
and
everything
will
be
ok
that
they
are
being
watched
over
by
a
higher
power
and
its
minions
this
has
a
very
high
psychological
attraction
for
quite
a
few
people
and
these
people
are
willing
to
put
up
with
a
few
discrepancies
and
holes
in
their
belief
system
for
what
it
gains
them
this
is
why
i
think
its
kind
of
useless
to
try
too
hard
to
convert
theists
to
atheism
they
are
happy
with
their
fantasy
and
they
feel
that
other
people
will
be
happy
with
it
too
they
cant
accept
the
fact
that
there
are
people
who
would
rather
accept
the
harsh
reality
that
they
are
running
from
anyway
im
getting
kind
of
carried
away
here
but
my
point
is
that
theism
doesnt
have
to
be
ingrained
into
a
childs
mindset
for
that
person
to
grow
up
as
a
theist
although
this
happens
far
too
often
theism
is
designed
to
have
its
own
attractions
atheist
libertarian
proindividuality
proresponsibility
