what
is
the
fact
of
evolution
there
is
a
difference
between
calling
evolution
a
fact
and
talking
about
the
theory
of
evolution
providing
facts
i
happen
to
think
the
latter
is
more
accurate
deleted
evolution
is
both
fact
and
theory
the
theory
of
evolution
represents
the
scientific
attempt
to
explain
the
fact
of
evolution
the
theory
of
evolution
does
not
provide
facts
it
explains
facts
it
can
be
safely
assumed
that
all
scientific
theories
neither
provide
nor
become
facts
but
rather
explain
facts
i
recommend
that
you
do
some
appropriate
reading
in
general
science
a
good
starting
point
with
regard
to
evolution
for
the
layman
would
be
evolution
as
fact
and
theory
in
hens
teeth
and
