after

can
we

atoms
are
not
objective
they
arent
even
real
what
scientists
call
an
atom
is
nothing
more
than
a
mathematical
model
that
describes
certain
physical
observable
properties
of
our
surroundings
all
of
which
is
subjective
jim
halat
this
deserves
framing
it
really
does
atoms
arent
even
real
tell
me
then
those
atoms
we
have
seen
with
electron
microscopes
are
atoms
now
so
what
are
they
figments
of
our
imaginations
the
evidence
that
atoms
are
real
is
overwhelming
but
i
wont
bother
with
most
evidence
at
the
moment
never
program
and
drink
beer
at
the
same
m
time
it
doesnt
work
