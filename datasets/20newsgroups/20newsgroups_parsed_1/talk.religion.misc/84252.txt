re
christian
metaethics
russell
turpin
as
is
his
wont
has
raised
some
interesting
issues
in
his
struggle
with
the
christian
texts
and
the
christians
unfortunately
he
seems
to
be
hoping
for
simplicity
where
it
is
not
available
the
lukewarm
stew
he
detects
may
well
be
an
inevitable
result
of
the
divine
mixing
himself
up
with
a
bunch
of
losers
such
as
humanity
also
unfortunately
perhaps
i
have
a
deadline
in
two
weeks
the
responsibility
for
which
prevents
me
in
good
conscience
from
writing
a
more
considered
response
and
fully
entering
the
fray
as
it
were
let
me
then
say
what
i
can
briefly
the
two
commandments
are
rules
they
are
merely
rules
that
are
so
vague
that
they
are
practically
devoid
of
meaning
this
point
for
the
netbrowsers
who
also
still
read
books
is
pursued
throughly
in
kaufmann
critiqueofreligionandphilosophy
the
commandment
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
can
be
viewed
in
part
as
reminding
man
that
he
is
not
god
and
can
not
act
as
if
he
has
ultimate
responsibility
this
is
a
theological
statement
worthy
of
barth
dr
turpin
dd
may
wear
the
black
robe
of
geneva
yet
indeed
many
traditions
present
an
interpretation
where
believers
are
supposed
to
interpret
loving
ones
neighbor
as
following
various
other
rules
and
relying
on
their
god
to
make
things
come
out
right
precisely
because
it
would
be
wrong
for
man
to
assume
such
ultimate
responsibility
once
again
we
are
confronted
with
good
sounding
goo
that
means
whatever
the
reader
wants
it
to
mean
this
requires
the
assumption
that
all
interpretations
are
equally
valid
that
there
is
no
way
of
reasonably
distinguishing
among
them
i
wouldnt
make
that
assumption
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
and
who
is
to
say
that
this
interpretation
is
twisted
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
in
their
most
straightforward
reading
show
the
christian
god
behaving
in
just
this
way
michael
and
i
and
others
read
the
bible
with
christian
glasses
among
the
things
that
this
should
imply
is
that
the
nt
informs
the
ot
even
to
the
point
of
dominanting
it
some
points
in
the
ot
ceremonial
dietary
laws
are
explicitly
abrogated
by
the
nt
texts
to
drive
russell
turpins
point
with
adequacy
one
needs
to
begin
with
nt
texts
probably
from
matthew
and
probably
about
damnation
just
trying
to
help
this
part
is
i
discover
what
most
moves
me
to
post
mls
i
am
a
radical
christian
only
in
that
i
take
the
gospel
seriously
no
michael
the
conservative
christians
also
take
the
gospel
seriously
what
differentiates
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
russell
turpins
no
here
is
misplaced
not
to
say
inappropriate
michaels
selfdescription
much
govern
the
equation
of
radical
liberal
which
seems
implied
by
russell
turpin
is
wrong
radical
conservatives
are
possible
if
sadly
lacking
in
numbers
at
present
thomas
merton
was
a
radical
even
though
conservative
in
some
ways
st
francis
was
a
radical
similarly
how
many
examples
are
needed
mls
why
dont
i
and
the
myriads
of
other
christians
like
me
mls
tell
you
something
about
christianity
michaels
question
gets
to
a
heart
of
the
matter
klingons
have
two
hearts
so
my
metaphor
is
not
mixed
just
extraterrestrial
russell
turpin
in
an
earlier
post
had
said
that
michael
michaels
theological
positions
actually
didnt
tell
him
much
about
christianity
dean
simeon
responds
this
time
gently
what
do
you
mean
more
direct
perhaps
would
have
been
what
could
you
possibly
mean
the
implied
rhetorical
effort
to
separate
michael
from
the
tradition
is
a
failure
michael
is
in
the
tradition
if
your
idea
of
the
tradition
doesnt
include
him
change
your
idea
of
the
tradition
the
irony
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
christianity
per
se
that
michael
can
use
to
support
the
cause
of
lesbians
and
gays
how
can
one
answer
this
while
staying
on
the
more
general
issue
im
on
the
other
side
of
the
interpretive
fence
from
michael
on
this
issue
yet
nothing
is
a
hideous
overstatement
one
verse
is
enough
to
refute
it
ill
offer
two
from
paul
of
all
people
in
jesus
christ
there
is
neither
male
nor
femalegalatians
i
dont
quote
single
verses
as
a
rule
and
i
dont
carry
them
in
my
head
and
nothing
shall
separate
us
from
the
glory
of
god
roughly
from
romans
if
russell
would
promise
to
convert
based
on
these
or
any
other
verses
id
promise
to
get
the
full
context
for
any
that
he
requires
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principles
that
make
michaels
christianity
beneficial
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
as
beneficial
perhaps
moreso
without
being
filtered
by
christian
interpretation
this
conclusion
does
not
follow
even
in
short
from
the
argument
that
goes
before
a
surprising
logical
ellipsis

are

trapped
