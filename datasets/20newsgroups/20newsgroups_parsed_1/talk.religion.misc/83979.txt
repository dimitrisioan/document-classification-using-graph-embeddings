re
is
it
good
that
jesus
died
in
article
brian
kendig
writes
as
long
as
were
trading
secrets
let
me
tell
yall
one
i
got
a
really
bad
feeling
in
my
heart
back
when
i
was
a
christian
i
couldnt
really
pinpoint
it
but
something
felt
dreadfully
cheap
and
wrong
about
the
whole
affair
i
had
been
a
devout
follower
even
a
biblebanger
but
eventually
it
started
ringing
terribly
hollow
to
me
and
i
felt
torn
when
i
began
to
disagree
with
a
lot
of
what
the
bible
and
my
priests
told
me
this
was
what
made
me
finally
realize
that
either
i
was
very
wrong
or
else
the
bible
was
very
wrong
and
since
i
felt
reasonably
sure
of
myself
i
decided
to
start
analyzing
the
bible
very
closely
that
was
the
catalyst
to
my
break
with
my
faith
though
it
was
a
long
and
difficult
effort
brian
have
you
checked
out
what
your
priests
told
you
in
the
bible
to
see
whether
they
were
telling
you
the
truth
did
you
know
that
according
to
the
bible
there
shouldnt
even
be
such
things
as
priests
anymore
do
you
know
why
the
preisthood
was
established
in
the
old
testament
to
begin
with
and
the
reasons
why
after
jesus
there
were
no
prieststhat
is
until
the
roman
catholic
church
years
later
devised
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
by
ignoring
the
whole
concept
beyond
the
book
of
hebrews
you
said
you
analyzed
the
bible
very
closely
i
think
you
are
lying
for
if
you
had
i
would
think
you
would
have
at
least
got
the
doctrine
of
hell
straight
so
what
is
your
beef
against
jesus
be
specific
and
point
on
verses
