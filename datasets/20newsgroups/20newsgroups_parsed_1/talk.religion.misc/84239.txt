why
is
the
nt
tossed
out
as
info
on
jesus
i
realize
it
is
normally
tossed
out
because
it
contains
miracles
but
what
are
the
other
reasons
it
is
not
tossed
out
as
a
source
but
would
it
be
regarded
as
unbiased
and
independant
this
brings
up
another
something
i
have
never
understood
i
asked
this
once
before
and
got
a
few
interesting
responses
but
somehow
didnt
seem
satisfied
why
would
the
nt
not
be
considered
a
good
source
this
might
be
a
literaryhistorical
question
but
when
i
studied
history
i
always
looked
for
firsthand
original
sources
to
write
my
papers
if
the
topic
was
on
mr
x
i
looked
to
see
if
mr
x
wrote
anything
about
it
if
the
topic
was
on
a
group
look
for
the
group
etc
if
the
topic
is
on
mr
x
and
mr
x
did
not
write
anything
about
it
barring
the
theistic
response
about
the
bible
being
divinely
inspired
which
i
cant
adequately
argue
wouldnt
we
look
for
people
who
ate
worked
walked
talked
etc
with
him
if
someone
was
at
an
event
wouldnt
they
be
a
better
reporter
than
someone
who
heard
about
it
second
hand
i
guess
isnt
firsthand
better
than
second
hand
i
know
there
is
bias
and
winners
writing
history
but
doesnt
the
principle
of
firsthand
being
best
still
apply
mac
michael

i
wont
raise
taxes
