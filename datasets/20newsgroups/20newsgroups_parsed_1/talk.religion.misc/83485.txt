here
children
we
have
a
person
playing
the
objective
morality
doesnt
exist
show
me
one
game
you
can
play
this
with
just
about
anything
and
this
objective
medicine
is
and
this
objective
physics
is
and
this
objective
reality
is
precisely
theres
no
objective
medicine
some
people
get
marvellous
results
from
alternative
therapy
others
only
respond
to
traditional
medicine
theres
no
objective
physics
einstein
and
bohr
have
told
us
that
theres
no
objective
reality
lsd

be
sufficient

a
useful
fiction
an
abstract
ideal
we
can
strive
towards
like
an
ideal
gas
or
a
light
inextensible
string
it
doesnt
actually
exist
but
we
can
talk
about
things
as
if
they
were
like
it
and
not
be
too
far
wrong
