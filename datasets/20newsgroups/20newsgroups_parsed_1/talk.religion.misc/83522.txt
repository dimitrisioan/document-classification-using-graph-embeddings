re
rosicrucian
orders
in
a
previous
article
ba
davishowe
says
on
the
subject
of
how
many
competing
rc
orders
there
are
let
me
point
out
the
golden
dawn
is
only
the
outer
order
of
that
tradition
the
inner
order
is
the
roseae
rubeae
et
aurae
crucis
just
wondering
do
you
mean
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
warning
there
is
no
point
in
arguing
whos
legit
and
whos
not
which
golden
dawn
are
you
talking
about
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
reflecting
no
affiliation
i
am
going
to
say
that
the
true
rosicrucian
order
is
the
fraternitas
rosae
crucis
in
quakertown
penn
any
takers
fraternally
