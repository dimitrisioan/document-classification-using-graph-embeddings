my
online
bible
is
on
a
cd
but
i
dont
own
a
cdrom
system
for
the
time
being
so
i
cant
search
for
the
famous
cite
where
jesus
explicitly
states
that
he
didnt
want
to
break
existing
jewish
laws
in
other
words
technically
speaking
christians
should
use
saturday
and
not
sunday
as
their
holy
day
if
they
want
to
conform
to
the
teachings
of
jesus
who
said
christians
want
to
conform
to
the
teachings
of
jesus
you
are
the
light
of
the
world
a
city
cant
be
hidden
lying
on
a
mountaintop
nor
do
people
light
a
candle
and
cover
it
with
a
big
basket
they
put
it
up
on
a
tall
candlestick
where
it
can
shine
for
everyone
in
the
house
thats
how
your
light
must
shine
in
front
of
the
world
so
that
people
see
your
good
deeds
and
give
credit
to
your
father
in
the
skies
dont
think
i
came
to
dissolve
the
law
torah
aka
first
five
books
or
the
prophets
major
plus
minor
i
didnt
come
to
dissolve
them
i
came
to
fulfill
them
i
assure
you
till
the
sky
and
the
earth
go
away
not
one
letter
or
punctuation
mark
of
the
law
will
ever
go
away
until
everthing
has
come
to
pass
so
anyone
who
dissolves
even
one
of
the
smallest
commandments
and
teaches
others
the
same
way
will
be
known
as
the
lowest
in
the
kingdom
of
the
skies
whereas
anyone
who
keeps
the
commands
and
teaches
them
too
will
be
known
as
someone
great
in
the
kingdom
of
the
skies
