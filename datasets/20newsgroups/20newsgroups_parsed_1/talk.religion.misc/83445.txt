contorts
it
can
not
be
a
light
which
cleanses
if
it
is
tainted
with
the
blood
of
an
innocent
man
now
showing
how
brian
kendig
is
in
the
dark
of
the
most
fundamental
basic
of
the
old
testament
concepts
like
santification
and
lev
must
be
foreign
to
you
too
bad
you
are
not
interested
in
understanding
too
bad
you
prefer
blurting
folly
even
to
your
own
shame
lev
for
the
life
of
the
flesh
is
in
the
blood
and
i
have
given
it
to
you
upon
the
altar
to
make
atonement
for
your
souls
for
it
is
the
blood
that
makes
atonement
for
the
soul
the
old
testament
was
very
big
on
the
eye
for
an
eye
business
it
makes
sense
that
leviticus
would
support
physical
injury
to
repay
moral
wrongdoing
i
know
about
sanctification
ive
been
taught
all
about
it
in
sunday
school
catechism
class
and
theology
classes
but
even
after
all
that
i
still
cant
accept
it
maybe
im
still
not
understanding
it
or
maybe
im
just
understanding
it
all
too
well
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
know
that
the
punishment
of
an
innocent
man
is
wrong
ive
tried
repeatedly
over
the
course
of
several
years
to
accept
it
but
i
just
cant
if
this
means
that
i
cant
accept
the
premise
that
a
god
who
would
allow
this
is
perfectly
good
then
so
be
it
what
ignorance
you
can
show
us
next
i
guess
ill
wait
till
tomorrow
if
you
can
explain
to
me
why
the
death
of
jesus
was
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warned
however
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
arguments
before
and
they
just
dont
convince
me

je
ne
suis
fait
comme
aucun
de
ceux
que
jai
vus
jose
croire
netre
fait
comme
aucun
de

qui

the
meaning
of
life
si
je
ne
vaux
pas
mieux
au
moins
je
suis
autre
is
that
it
