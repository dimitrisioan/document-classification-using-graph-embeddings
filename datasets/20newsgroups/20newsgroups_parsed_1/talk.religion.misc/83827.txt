question
on
sabbath
question
correction
there
are
a
few
groups
that
continue
to
believe
christians
have
to
worship
on
the
sabbath
saturday
the
bestknown
are
the
seventhday
adventists
and
jehovahs
witnesses
they
argue
that
act
is
not
a
regular
worship
service
but
a
special
meeting
to
see
paul
off
and
that
i
cor
doesnt
explicitly
say
its
a
regular
worship
service
jehovahs
witnesses
do
not
believe
that
christians
are
required
to
observe
the
sabbath
whether
it
is
on
saturday
or
sunday
the
sabbath
was
part
of
a
covenent
between
god
and
the
israelites
and
is
not
required
for
christians
