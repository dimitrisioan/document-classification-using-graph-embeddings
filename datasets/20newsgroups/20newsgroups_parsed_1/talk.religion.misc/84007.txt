stseems
to
me
koresh
is
yet
another
messenger
that
got
killed
stfor
the
message
he
carried
which
says
nothing
about
the
kmseems
to
be
barring
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
koresh
was
simply
kmanother
deranged
fanatic
who
thought
it
neccessary
to
take
a
whole
bunch
of
kmfolks
with
him
children
and
all
to
satisfy
his
delusional
mania
jim
kmjones
circa
i
think
theres
plenty
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
six
rescued
davidians
consistantly
recounted
that
the
federal
tank
knocked
over
a
barrel
of
propane
these
guys
havent
exactly
been
spending
time
together
plotting
an
elaborate
and
consistent
story
it
would
be
contradictory
for
koresh
to
go
for
mass
suicide
remember
that
koreshs
death
was
the
opening
of
the
sixth
seal
the
signal
that
armageddon
had
begun
his
army
the
people
in
the
compound
would
then
fight
the
powers
of
evil
and
win
ending
in
the
rapture
the
fire
wiped
out
his
army
i
read
earlier
that
koresh
was
planning
to
walk
out
of
the
compound
and
blow
himself
up
with
a
grenade
that
would
jibe
better
with
his
teachings
stin
the
mean
time
we
sure
learned
a
lot
about
evil
and
corruption
stare
you
surprised
things
have
gotten
that
rotten
kmnope
fruitcakes
like
koresh
have
been
demonstrating
such
evil
corruption
kmfor
centuries
id
think
youd
be
the
last
one
to
support
gassing
people
and
burning
them
to
death
for
their
religious
beliefs
corrupt
evil
i
dont
know
well
never
know
and
when
you
start
calling
people
fruitcakes
about
their
religious
beliefs
thats
dehumanizing
people
we
saw
what
happened
when
many
germans
started
believing
that
jews
were
subhuman
in
one
neat
stroke
they
destroyed
all
the
evidence
that
could
have
pointed
to
wrongdoing
and
killed
all
the
witnesses
including
children
whose
last
view
of
life
was
choking
and
pain
followed
by
burning
them
alive
i
am
extremely
saddened
that
this
tragedy
occurred
im
furious
that
they
used
my
money
to
do
it
so
i
become
an
accessory
dave
criswell
and
i
dont
have
an
alibi
oracle
corporation
to
the
victim
on
my
doorstep
only
way
i
can
justify
its
