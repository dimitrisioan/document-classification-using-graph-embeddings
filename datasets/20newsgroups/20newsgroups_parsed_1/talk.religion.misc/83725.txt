writes
with
the
southern
baptist
convention
convening
this
june
to
consider
the
charges
that
freemasonry
is
incompatible
with
christianity
i
thought
the
following
quotes
by
mr
james
holly
the
antimasonic
flag
carrier
would
amuse
you
all
munch
i
hope
you
all
had
a
good
laugh
i
know
i
did
g
it
would
be
funny
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
nasty
and
as
nonxian
as
i
am
its
hard
to
believe
that
someone
is
pushing
black
is
white
and
freedom
is
slavery
so
blatantly
mark
