re
apr
gods
promise
in
john
i
had
said
merlyn
you
missed
the
point
too
christianity
is
a
relationship
i
have
a
relationship
with
my
god
i
know
him
consider
your
mother
merlyn
you
know
your
mother
what
would
you
think
of
me
if
i
asserted
that
your
mother
is
feet
tall
murdered
your
father
and
sexually
abused
you
when
you
were
a
kid
would
you
who
knows
your
mother
well
think
was
a
blind
arrogant
idiot
to
proclaim
such
things
merlyn
leroy
says
this
analogy
is
not
good
for
example
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
know
god
as
well
as
you
do
but
dont
agree
on
things
like
how
many
children
heshe
has
whether
heshe
approves
of
polygamy
whether
mohammed
was
one
of
hisher
prophets
now
if
you
and
all
these
other
people
who
absolutely
know
what
god
is
like
cant
agree
on
basic
attributes
like
these
at
least
one
of
you
who
knows
what
this
godthing
is
like
must
be
wrong
therefore
subjective
certainty
is
worthless
regarding
knowledge
of
this
god
on
the
other
hand
i
dont
know
any
large
groups
of
people
who
claim
absolute
knowledge
of
my
mother
and
who
disagree
about
her
basic
attributes
this
is
the
difference
between
real
people
and
imaginary
friends
meryln
therefore
by
your
logic
since
your
people
disagree
about
the
characteristics
of
your
mother
you
mother
must
be
imaginary
