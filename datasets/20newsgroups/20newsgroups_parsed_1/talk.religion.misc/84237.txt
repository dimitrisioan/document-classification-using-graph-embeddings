ive
often
wondered
what
business
followers
of
christ
pmy
would
have
with
weapons
fc
didnt
christ
tell
his
disciples
to
arm
them
selves
shortly
fc
before
his
crusifiction
i
believe
the
exact
quote
was
along
the
fc
lines
of
if
you
have
something
sell
it
and
buy
a
sword
if
you
have
a
purse
it
was
fc
certainly
christ
said
fc
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
send
peace
on
earth
i
came
not
to
fc
send
peace
but
the
sword
for
i
am
come
to
set
a
man
at
variance
fc
against
his
father
and
the
daugher
against
her
mother
fc
matthew
yes
he
said
this
but
the
sword
that
jesus
brought
was
the
sword
of
the
word
of
god
which
divides
between
those
that
believe
and
those
who
do
not
