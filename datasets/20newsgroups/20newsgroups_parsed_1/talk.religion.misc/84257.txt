jesus
christ
never
commanded
toleration
as
a
motive
for
his
disciples
and
toleration
is
the
antithesis
of
the
christian
message
page
the
central
dynamic
of
the
freemason
drive
for
world
unity
through
fraternity
liberty
and
equality
is
toleration
this
is
seen
in
the
writings
of
the
great
writers
of
freemasonry

a
laugh
tony
this
religeous
bigot
scares
the
shit
out
of
me
and
that
any
one
bothers
to
listen
to
him
causes
me
to
have
grave
doubts
about
the
future
of
just
about
anything

a
southern
babtist
and
one
who
has
beliefs
beyond
the
teachings
of
either
not
to
worry
the
masons
have
been
demonized
and
harrassed
by
almost
every
major
xian
church
there
is
for
centuries
now
and
still
they
stand
they
wil
withstand
the
miserable
southern
boobtists
i
am
sure
they
may
even
pick
up
a
little
support
as
people
start
to
listen
to
the
boobtists
and
realize
that
subtracting
the
obvious
lies
and
claims
of
satanism
that
the
masons
sound
pretty
good
by
comparison
one
thing
is
known
a
sizable
proportion
of
southern
babtists
are
masons
and
the
masons
have
already
fired
back
in
their
own
magazines
against
the
boobtist
witchhunt
since
the
consrervatives
have
already
been
a
divisive
element
with
their
war
on
boobtist
moderates
and
liberals
they
may
now
start
in
on
their
masonboobtist
brothers
and
hasten
their
own
downfall
as
more
and
more
southern
boobtists
realize
their
church
cant
stand
being
run
by
a
handful
of
clowns
looking
for
holy
civil
wars
and
purity
tests
and
drop
em
out
of
the
leadership
positions
they
have
taken
over
so

i
am
concerned
