for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
and
i
think
we
ought
to
hold
christ
accoountable
for
all
of
his
followers
who
died
at
the
hand
of
the
romans
also
it
was
their
own
fault
for
believing
god
this
society
reminds
me
more
of
the
roman
empire
every
day
i
guess
ill
just
log
off
and
go
watch
american
gladiators
chris
all
jobs
are
easy
to
the
person
who
doesnt
have
to
do
them
