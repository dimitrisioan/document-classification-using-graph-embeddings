re
after
years
can
we
say
that
christian
morality
is
in
article
frank
odwyer
writes
as
i
recall
i
first
entered
the
fray
on
this
matter
in
response
to
an
assertion
by
simon
clippingdale
that
morality
was
relative
oops
quite
right
i
got
so
busy
that
i
saved
franks
last
post
back
then
intending
to
respond
when
i
could
and
i
sort
of
forgot
ill
try
to
do
it
soon
if
anyones
still
interested
and
probably
even
if
theyre
not
is
he
therefore
trying
to
sell
something
i
dont
think
so
well
yes
maybe
i
am
im
trying
to
have
people
buy
and
take
on
my
opinions
thus
causing
said
opinions
to
spread
in
timehonoured
memetic
virus
mode
until
the
world
is
a
veritable
paradise
so
how
about
it
folks
as
they
say
over
here
you
know
it
makes
sense

im
not
hatching
that
