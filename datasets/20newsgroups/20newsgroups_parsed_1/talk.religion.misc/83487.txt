i
am
not
a

all
flavours

christianity
hold
that
a
objective
morality
exists
and
b
their
particular
interpretation
of
scripturerevelationtv
is
a
goodly
glimpse
of
it
that
they
may
all
disagree
about

says
nothing
about
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
a
actually
they
generally
claim
that
b
their
particular
interpretation
of
scripturerevelation
is
this
objective
morality
that
there
are
two
conflicting
versions
of
this
objective
morality
does
tell
us
something
about
a
it
tells
us
at

one
fake
objective
morality
exists
the
next
logical
step
is
to
deduce
that
any

religions
objective
morality
could
be
the
fake
one
