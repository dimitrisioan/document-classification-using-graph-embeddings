why
is
the
nt
tossed
out
as
info
on
jesus
i
realize
it
is
normally
tossed
out
because
it
contains
miracles
but
what
are
the
other
reasons
it
is
not
tossed
out
as
a
source
but
would
it
be
regarded
as
unbiased
and
independant
this
brings
up
another
something
i
have
never
understood
i
asked
this
once
before
and
got
a
few
interesting
responses
but
somehow
didnt
seem
satisfied
why
would
the
nt
not
be
considered
a
good
source
contradicting
itself
on
facts
for
