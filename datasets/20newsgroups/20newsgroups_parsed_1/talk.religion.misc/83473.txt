a
out
of
context
must
have
missed
when
you
said
this
about
these
other
promises
of
god
that
we
keep
getting
subjected
to
could
you
please
explain
why
i
am
wrong
and
they
are
ok
or
an
acknowledgement
of
public
hypocrisy
both
or
neither
so
according
to
you
jim
the
only
way
to
criticize
one
person
for
taking
a
quote
out
of
context
without
being
a
hypocrite
is
to
post
a
response
to
every
person
on
trm
who
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
did
i
either
ask
or
assert
that
or
is
this
your
misaimed
telepathy
at
work
again
stephen
said
you
took
a
quote
out
of
context
you
noted
that
stephen
had
not
replied
to
some
other
trm
article
call
it
a
that
took
a
quote
out
of
context
but
the
lack
of
evidence
for
x
does
not
constitute
evidence
for
the
lack
of
x
a
common
creationist
error
so
the
fact
that
stephen
did
not
reply
to
a
does
not
justify
the
conclusion
that
stephen
condoned
taking
quotes
out
of
context
in
a
you
asked
stephen
to
explain
why
you
were
wrong
and
they
were
ok
or
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
being
a
hypocrite
both
of
the
choices
you
give
stephen
assume
that
he
condoned
taking
quotes
out
of
context
in
a
i
assumed
you
were
being
logical
and
that
the
sentence
that
begins
could
you
please
explain
was
not
a
nonsequitur
but
was
intended
to
follow
from
the
sentence
that
preceded
it
therefore
i
concluded
that
you
believed
that
implied
that
stephen
condoned
taking
quotes
out
of
context
in
a
but
weve
already
seen
that
does
not
imply
this
therefore
you
were
incorrect
to
believe
that
implied
that
stephen
thought
it
was
okay
to
take
quotes
out
of
context
in
a
and
were
making
an
error
of
a
kind
that
is
frequently
made
by
creationists
is
that
better
jim
its
called
an
argument
if
you
disagree
with
it
explain
why
the
argument
is
not
sound
i
admit
that
my
assumption
in
may
have
been
a
bit
hasty
if
you
agree
with
it
just
say
yup
dj
yup
jims
emailed
response
when
i
pointed
out
in
a
posted
article
that
one
of
his
arguments
was
a
straw
man
argument
reminiscent
of
a
frequent
creationist
ploy
