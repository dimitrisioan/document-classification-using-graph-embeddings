you
just
dont
get
it
do
you
in
fact
i
believe
your
religion
is
imaginary
you
have
clearly
demonstrated
that
you
do
not
even
know
what
my
religion
is
in
order
to
make
that
assumption
please
offer
me
an
argument
thats
more
convincing
than
you
just
dont
believe
cos
you
dont
want
to
how
i
can
present
any
argument
when
you
put
your
hands
over
your
eyes
and
devise
new
irrevelant
excuses
each
time
the
fact
remains
you
want
to
argue
about
something
that
you
do
not
know
anything
about
do
you
not
have
to
learn
a
topic
first
before
you
can
reasonably
debate
the
topic
which
brings
us
about
to
the
start
of
this
thread
you
began
perverting
bible
verses
interpreting
them
without
investigation
for
if
you
desired
to
investigate
you
would
have
changed
your
tune
immediately
thus
it
is
clear
to
me
you
do
not
believe
what
i
am
saying
because
you
dont
want
to
check
it
out
everything
youve
said
so
far
could
apply
equally
to
any
religion
why
do
you
believe
yours
is
the
real
one
then
you
must
have
also
ignored
every
other
post
i
have
written
to
you
this
would
seem
to
go
along
with
your
character
brian
it
doesnt
offend
me
if
you
decide
to
reject
jesus
christ
i
only
wish
you
would
make
that
decision
after
you
learn
who
jesus
is
