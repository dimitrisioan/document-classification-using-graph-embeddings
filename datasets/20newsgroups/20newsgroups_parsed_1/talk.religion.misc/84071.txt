subject
re
judas
crucifixion
tyre
etc
frank
decenso
but
how
its
evident
from
the
texts
in
ezek
that
god
isnt
concerned
about
buildings
or
structures
god
is
concerned
about
people
the
people
and
leadership
ezek
never
did
return
as
a
city
others
may
have
come
later
and
built
a
city
but
the
people
and
leadership
that
god
prophesied
about
in
ezek
were
never
rebuilt
as
a
city
of
people
and
leaders
how
incredibly
fucking
stupid
of
course
the
text
is
referring
to
the
city
itself
buildings
bricks
mortar
etc
otherwise
it
makes
no
sense
to
refer
to
the
future
of
tyre
as
being
reduced
to
nothing
but
a
place
to
spread
fishing
nets
is
there
any
twisting
of
text
or
semantic
game
that
you
wont
do
to
preserve
your
faith
from
admission
of
error
decenso
