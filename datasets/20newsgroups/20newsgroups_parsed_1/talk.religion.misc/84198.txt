a
message
for
you
mr
president
how
do
you
know
what
happened

lance

writes
they
cut
off
the
water
there
were
no
fire
trucks
present
they
refused
to
bring
in
fire
equipment
for
fear
that
the
firemen
would
be
shot
at
and
the
fbiatf
go
blasting
holes
into
the
builing
and
firing
gas
munitions
they
used
a
tank
to
knock
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
they
released
nontoxic
nonflammable
tear
gas
into
the
building
take
a
second
look
at
nontoxic
nonflammable
mace
sold
tothe
public
is
supposedly
nontoxic
whatthey
do
not
tell
you
is
that
if
you
get
mace
directly
on
the
linings
of
the
lungs
such
as
a
direct
snort
to
the
face
above
certain
quantities
it
reacts
similarly
to
a
mustard
gas
inhalation
i
know
my
father
and
grandfather
were
exposed
to
poison
gas
in
wwi
and
wwii
dad
went
through
the
side
effects
of
any
weapon
including
those
nontoxic
aerosols
what
the
label
actually
means
is
usually
it
wont
kill
you
it
may
give
you
permanent
css
asthsma
but
thats
better
than
blowing
a
hole
in
your
head
all
aerosols
are
flammable
if
you
have
enough
oxygen
and
hit
it
with
the
right
igniter
some
of
the
most
nonflammable
substances
known
will
boom
or
searflame
if
you
hit
it
with
the
right
combo
lets
take
one
a
trash
can
fire
makes
black
smoke
already
burned
right
cant
go
boom
right
wrong
suck
that
smoke
made
up
of
paper
that
has
carbonized
or
burned
about
of
the
fuel
in
it
into
an
air
conditioning
return
mix
with
about
air
and
light
a
match
feet
of
conduit
is
about
the
same
when
filled
with
that
smoke
mixture
as
oh
say
pounds
tnt
that
is
why
the
fire
codes
say
no
open
ceiling
tiles
in
buildings
because
stories
of
a
building
have
blown
out
by
nonflammable
smoke
so
take
a
little
nonflammable
aerosol
mix
with
gasoline
or
kerosene
fumes
no
electricity
remeber
a
bit
of
heating
on
the
waco
plains
boil
water
to
drink
since
the
water
was
cut
off
liberally
mix
and
allow
to
settle
for
hours
fumes
vent
down
into
the
bus
underground
and
the
davidians
move
the
children
upstairs
to
a
saferoom
they
had
one
armor
plated
remember
to
breath
because
kids
get
sick
and
die
from
tear
gas
and
along
comes
a
tracer
a
spark
what
have
you
everyone
burns
to
death
try
thinking
before
opening
mouth
it
may
not
have
happened
the
way
the
gmen
say
it
did
brian
kendig
je
ne
suis
fait
comme
aucun
de
ceux
que
jai
vus
jose
croire
netre
fait
comme
aucun
de
ceux
qui
existent
the
meaning
of
life
si
je
ne
vaux
pas
mieux
au
moins
je
suis
autre
is
that
it
ends
