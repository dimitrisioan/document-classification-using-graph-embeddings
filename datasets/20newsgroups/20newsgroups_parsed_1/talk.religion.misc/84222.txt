i
can
certainly
see
opposing
the
amen
but
that
doesnt
require
opposing
a
moment
of
silence
if
the
only
people
proposing
a
moment
of
silence
are
doing
so
as
a
sham
to
sneak
in
prayers
then
it
must
be
opposed
what
the
hell
have
prayers
to
do
with
public
schooling
i
ask
this
question
as
a
devout
christian
uh
oh
michael
you
typed
hell
and
capitalized
it
to
boot
now
peter
nyikos
will
explain
that
youre
not
a
real
christian
ill
back
off
when
they
do
does
anybody
else
besides
me
see
a
vicious
circle
here
i
guarantee
you
the
people
who
want
school
prayer
arent
going
to
back
off
when
they
cant
even
manage
to
get
a
quiet
moment
for
their
kids
to
pray
silently
their
kids
can
bloodywell
pray
any
goddamned
time
they
want
to
and
nothing
on
heaven
or
earth
in
government
or
the
principals
office
can
prevent
or
in
any
other
way
deal
with
their
doing
so
especially
if
the
prayer
is
silent
as
bursting
out
into
the
shema
yisrael
or
some
other
prayer
might
be
construed
as
disruptive
if
audible
no
one
ever
prevented
me
from
praying
in
public
school
they
hardly
even
prevented
me
from
masturbating
in
study
hall
bzzt
sorry
michaelthe
nyikos
inquisition
pointed
out
that
i
was
hellbound
after
one
mildly
scurrilous
pun
on
revealing
oneself
admitting
to
masturbationwell
im
just
shocked
