lev
for
the
life
of
the
flesh
is
in
the
blood
and
i
have
given
it
to
you
upon
the
altar
to
make
atonement
for
your
souls
for
it
is
the
blood
that
makes
atonement
for
the
soul
the
old
testament
was
very
big
on
the
eye
for
an
eye
business
it
makes
sense
that
leviticus
would
support
physical
injury
to
repay
moral
wrongdoing
brian
k
guess
what
you
missed
the
point
on
a
scale
from
cold
to
hot
you
are
at
degrees
kelvin
i
know
about
sanctification
ive
been
taught
all
about
it
in
sunday
school
catechism
class
and
theology
classes
but
even
after
all
that
i
still
cant
accept
it
maybe
im
still
not
understanding
it
or
maybe
im
just
understanding
it
all
too
well
then
as
you
understand
it
what
is
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
know
that
the
punishment
of
an
innocent
man
is
wrong
yes
i
agree
with
that
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
jesus
punishment
you
say
jesus
did
not
regard
his
death
as
punishment
ive
tried
repeatedly
over
the
course
of
several
years
to
accept
it
but
i
just
cant
good
i
wouldnt
eithernot
the
way
you
understand
it
if
you
can
explain
to
me
why
the
death
of
jesus
was
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warned
however
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
arguments
before
and
they
just
dont
convince
me
ask
jesus
himself
he
himself
said
why
in
john
it
isnt
a
mystery
to
anyone
and
there
certainly
is
no
need
for
a
persuasive
argument
read
jesuss
own
reply
to
your
question
jesus
gives
more
reasons
in
john
but
one
obvious
reason
why
jesus
died
and
as
with
everything
else
it
has
nothing
do
with
his
punishment
was
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubting
and
believe
john
the
fact
that
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obvious
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
this
obvious
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vanity
why
did
jesus
suffer
in
his
death
again
ask
jesus
jesus
says
why
in
john
thats
no
mystery
either
the
world
hates
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclamation
of
how
far
we
humans
botch
things
up
and
thus
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
and
why
cant
you
brian
k
accept
this
how
can
you
the
world
can
not
accept
him
because
it
neither
sees
him
nor
knows
him
john
the
animosity
and
the
lack
of
knowledge
that
comes
out
in
your
twistings
of
roberts
daily
verses
is
very
convincing
testimony
of
the
truth
of
john
and
i
pray
and
hope
that
i
do
blurt
out
such
animosity
and
lack
of
knowledge
i
am
not
perfect
either
but
regardless
of
that
i
thank
god
that
jesus
revealed
himself
to
me
without
whom
id
also
be
bumbling
about
blindly
though
arrogantly
slandering
the
very
person
who
created
me
and
who
loves
me
