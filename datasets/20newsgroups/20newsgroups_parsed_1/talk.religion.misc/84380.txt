subject
re
is
it
good
that
jesus
died
brian
kendig
first
states
i
am
my
own
master
i
ask
are
you
truly
the
master
of
yourself
brian
kendig
states
not
yet
make
up
your
mind
but
my
life
is
the
ground
i
use
to
practice
on
the
fun
is
in
the
getting
there
we
dont
start
out
perfect
and
we
do
not
end
perfect
either
we
are
never
perfect
can
you
name
one
person
young
or
old
past
or
present
that
you
deem
perfect
good
luck
i
know
my
shortcomings
and
i
know
my
strengths
and
i
live
my
life
according
to
the
decisions
i
make
and
i
am
content
to
abide
with
the
consequences
of
my
decisions
as
easily
as
ill
accept
the
praise
for
them
there
have
been
times
in
my
life
when
ive
made
mistakes
yes
i
try
to
never
make
the
same
mistake
twice
then
you
lie
to
yourself
you
do
not
know
your
shortcomings
i
have
clearly
shown
one
of
your
shortcomings
if
not
two
that
is
ignorance
of
the
bible
and
the
arrogance
you
demonstrate
butchering
it
without
even
knowing
its
contents
i
regard
christ
as
a
myth
because
you
have
been
too
prideful
to
examine
the
record
of
him
for
yourself
and
to
demonstate
your
lack
of
support
for
your
conclusion
i
bet
you
do
not
even
know
what
the
word
christ
means
or
which
prophet
used
christ
to
describe
the
son
of
man
i
feel
that
there
are
far
too
many
people
offering
far
too
many
interpretations
of
what
he
supposedly
said
and
did
the
only
person
who
can
really
judge
me
is
me
yes
i
agree
with
that
so
we
must
learn
first
read
the
bible
come
up
with
our
own
interpretation
evaluate
what
is
being
said
and
by
whom
check
the
history
books
as
well
compare
someone
elses
interpretation
with
your
own
then
make
a
judgment
but
i
tell
you
the
truth
of
what
is
being
said
in
the
bible
needs
interpretation
as
much
as
a
coffee
cup
needs
interpretation
and
remember
the
bible
isnt
a
gurus
esoteric
guide
to
metaphysics
it
doesnt
take
a
theologian
to
understand
what
is
being
said
the
bible
is
a
bunch
of
testimonies
from
people
like
you
and
i
addressed
to
people
like
you
and
i
these
guys
wrote
down
what
they
saw
and
heard
is
it
their
open
diaryand
they
want
to
tell
you
something
and
because
they
want
you
to
know
something
they
make
it
very
clear
what
they
want
you
to
know
they
didnt
encouch
their
ideas
in
esoteric
rhetoric
but
in
simple
straightforward
language
i
choose
the
roads
i
travel
and
i
decide
whether
or
not
i
want
to
reach
the
end
of
any
given
road
or
turn
back
and
as
long
as
i
dont
always
turn
back
theres
no
shame
in
it
when
i
need
help
i
seek
out
my
friends
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoids
the
bible
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoids
a
confrontation
with
the
living
god
because
that
road
doesnt
look
appealing
to
you
you
rather
build
your
own
road
one
that
goes
far
away
from
that
confrontation
but
be
assured
of
this
you
will
have
to
confront
him
one
day
willingly
or
unwillingly
and
you
dont
have
a
clue
about
what
im
saying
either
open
your
eyes
and
see
open
your
ears
and
listen
im
not
just
spouting
off
empty
words
this
is
my
life
this
is
what
gives
me
meaning
i
see
what
you
mean
i
hear
what
your
saying
i
am
not
degrading
your
life
but
i
have
heard
the
same
irrational
excuses
for
years
there
is
nothing
new
in
what
you
are
saying
and
by
your
own
words
you
are
spouting
off
contradictions
if
contradictions
give
you
meaning
then
your
life
must
be
sad
i
say
my
mother
loves
me
how
do
i
know
you
ask
i
can
point
to
definite
things
shes
done
for
me
and
i
can
even
just
bring
her
to
you
so
you
can
ask
her
facetoface
you
say
your
deity
loves
you
how
do
you
know
i
ask
bingo
for
god
so
loved
the
world
he
gave
his
only
begotton
to
son
so
that
whososever
belives
in
him
will
have
ever
lasting
life
i
look
what
god
did
he
has
given
his
son
even
to
his
death
so
that
i
can
have
hope
in
his
resurrection
and
know
that
life
isnt
for
nothing
but
has
glorious
purpose
you
cant
even
convince
me
that
it
exists
because
you
turn
your
eyes
away
from
testimony
and
history
you
choose
to
lie
to
yourself
that
he
doesnt
exist
for
you
ignore
what
has
been
said
for
thousands
of
years
you
sound
exactly
almost
verbatim
like
the
lazarus
of
jesuss
story
starting
in
luke
and
the
conclusion
of
that
story
is
a
bleak
one
lazarus
wound
up
in
hell
the
story
ends
like
this
for
if
lazarus
doesnt
even
listen
to
moses
and
the
prophets
he
wont
even
believe
if
a
man
rose
from
the
dead
if
any
god
dangles
heaven
before
me
like
a
carrot
promising
untold
pleasures
to
me
if
ill
only
suspend
my
disbelief
and
ignore
my
rationality
for
just
this
once
then
i
would
choose
hell
i
can
not
lie
to
myself
to
placate
another
being
no
matter
how
powerful
it
is
arrogance
at
its
best
the
fact
is
you
are
not
rational
several
specific
cases
have
already
been
cited
and
again
with
this
new
statement
you
show
more
irrationality
with
regards
to
heaven
jesus
does
tell
you
something
of
what
to
expect
in
heaven
jesus
expects
you
to
use
your
brain
to
believe
in
him
jesus
does
not
expect
you
to
placate
either
jesus
wants
you
to
willingly
come
to
him
but
not
as
his
grovelling
slave
but
rather
as
his
brother
who
will
share
in
his
glorious
riches
why
do
you
not
pick
up
the
bible
and
read
it
for
yourself
you
maintain
you
have
an
open
mind
see
whether
you
are
lying
to
yourself
for
yourself
why
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
thats
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybody
else
any
good
either
because
everyone
dies
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
leading
a
good
life
is
meaningless
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
that
paragraph
demonstrates
that
you
havent
listened
to
a
single
word
ive
said
i
do
understand
what
you
said
but
thats
is
not
what
i
feel
went
amiss
here
you
missed
the
point
living
a
good
life
has
no
eternal
consequences
once
they
close
the
amusement
park
of
life
to
you
that
is
the
end
to
you
it
is
over
to
you
therefore
your
time
spent
in
the
amusement
park
is
meaningless
it
has
no
eternal
consequences
to
you
nor
to
anyone
left
on
earth
but
then
you
contradict
yourself
from
a
previous
post
you
said
doing
evil
things
is
bad
to
you
it
shouldnt
matter
if
you
do
evil
things
or
good
things
it
is
all
meaningless
in
the
end
anyway
so
go
rob
a
bank
go
tell
someone
you
dislike
that
he
is
a
dirty
rotten
slime
bag
whats
restraining
you
life
after
all
has
no
eternal
consequences
and
accountability
is
irrelevant
in
the
same
way
i
think
life
is
fun
and
i
dont
intend
to
leave
the
amusement
park
of
life
until
they
close
down
for
the
night
d
at
which
time
you
are
truly
not
the
master
of
yourself
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
has
the
resurrection
sunk
in
jesus
is
alive
jesus
is
not
dead
so
you
and
your
holy
book
say
by
the
same
token
therefore
santa
claus
delivers
toys
every
xmas
dont
you
see
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
what
you
say
is
true
please
give
me
some
reason
that
i
cant
similarly
apply
to
santa
claus
you
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
what
jesus
says
and
the
witnesses
of
jesus
say
are
true
but
you
choose
to
be
unreasonable
and
ignore
the
reasons
by
definition
ignorance
santa
claus
is
said
to
live
at
the
north
pole
and
have
a
squad
of
elves
and
flying
reindeer
ever
see
a
flying
reindeer
has
anyone
in
human
history
seen
a
flying
reindeer
has
anyone
seen
a
reindeer
whose
nose
blinks
red
on
the
other
hand
are
people
born
in
bethlehem
was
nebuchandezzar
really
a
king
was
daniel
really
one
of
his
court
officials
were
david
and
solomon
really
kings
of
israel
and
judah
was
their
really
a
king
called
jehoachin
did
sennecherib
really
attack
jerusalem
years
before
christ
did
sennacherib
really
lose
his
battleand
badly
was
there
really
a
caiaphas
who
interrogated
jesus
yes
yes
yes
history
verifies
it
it
is
nonfiction
do
you
have
a
problem
discerning
truth
from
fiction
perhaps
you
cant
evaluate
the
context
of
grimms
fairy
tales
apart
from
that
of
the
scientific
american
i
suppose
you
treat
both
with
equal
truthfulness
or
equal
falsity
is
this
what
you
are
telling
me
or
is
it
that
just
do
want
to
read
the
scientific
american
and
find
out
that
its
not
a
fairy
tale
are
you
thereby
inferring
that
your
deity
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
verses
in
a
book
and
can
not
be
supported
without
invoking
them
get
real
have
you
ever
been
to
zaire
do
you
have
to
go
there
to
be
assured
that
there
really
is
such
a
place
given
your
irrationality
i
take
it
you
have
never
used
a
map
in
your
life
why
do
you
believe
what
you
believe
given
the
overwhelming
evidence
as
well
as
my
personal
experience
with
the
living
god
id
be
an
irrational
unreasoning
ignorant
fool
if
i
didnt
follow
jesus
