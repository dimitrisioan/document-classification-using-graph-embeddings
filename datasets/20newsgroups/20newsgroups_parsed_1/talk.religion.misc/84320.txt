the
rape
has
passed
there
is
nothing
that
will
ever
take
that
away
true
but
forcing
her
to
remain
pregnant
continues
the
violation
of
her
body
for
another
months
i
see
this
as
being
unbelievably
cruel
if
she
doesnt
welcome
the
excruciating
pain
of
labor
the
selfish
bitch
deserves
to
die
in
childbirth
she
was
probably
lying
about
the
rape
anyway
