for
your
information
i
checked
the
library
of
congress
catalog
and
they
list
the
following
books
by
francis
hitching
ahhanow
with
the
branch
athiests
zealots
we
have
the
following
i
think
you
are
mistaken
in
thinking
tom
scharle
to
be
a
atheist
you
will
find
both
atheists
and
christians
among
your
opponents
on
to
calling
your
opponents
them
branch

zealots
does
nothing
for
your
credibility
let
me
try
again
oh
yes
do
the
doubt
that
has
infiltrated
the
previous
smugly
confident
certitude
of
evolutionary
biology
has
inflamed
passions
there
is
lack
of
agreement
even
within
warring
camps
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
there
are
as
many
variations
on
each
evolutionary
theme
as
there
are
individual

dear
me
this
is
taken
so
out
of
context
that
its
hard
to
know
where
to
start
the
quote
starts
with
material
from
p
and
ends
with
material
from
page
on
page
theres
the
bit
that
says
the
parts
left
out
in
john
kings
quote
are
marked
by
the
doubt
that
has
infiltrated
the
previous
smugly
confident
certitude
of
evolutionary
biologys
last
twenty
years
has
inflamed
passions
and
provoked
some
very
interesting
thought
and
research
eldridge
goes
on
immediately
following
the
butchered
quote
in
short
evolutionary
biology
has
entered
a
phase
of
creativity
that
is
the
hallmark
of
good
active
science
the
material
that
is
on
page
that
is
quoted
by
john
king
has
been
butchered
even
more
severely
i
mention
this
only
to
illustrate
the
there
isthese
words
not
in
the
original
textprl
lack
of
agreement
even
within
warring
camps
things
are
really
in
uproar
these
days
and
each
of
the
basic
ways
of
looking
at
evolutionary
biology
has
its
minor
variants
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
there
are
as
many
variations
on
each
evolutionary
theme
as
there
are
individual
biologists
eldridge
goes
on
but
thats
the
way
it
should
be
this
is
how
science
is
supposed
to
operate
jack
and
just
a
few
sentences
down
when
they
creationists
misrepresent
the
exuberant
creative
doubt
and
controversy
permeating
evolutionary
biology
these
days
they
are
actively
promoting
scientific
illiteracy
and
that
john
e
king
is
precisely
what
you
have
done
with
eldridges
article
are
you
personally
responsible
for
the
butchery
of
the
text
or
have
you
pulled
it
out
of
some
creationist
propaganda
you
owe
the
people
reading
to
an
apology
for
posting
such
misrepresentation
