i
learned
that
the
concept
of
the
holy
trinity
was
never
taught
by
jesus
christ
that
it
was
agreed
to
by
a
council
of
clergymen
long
after
christ
was
ascended
men
who
had
no
authority
to
speak
for
him
if
jesus
never
taught
the
concept
of
the
trinity
how
do
you
deal
with
the
following
mat
then
jesus
came
to
them
and
said
all
authority
in
heaven
and
on
earth
has
been
given
to
me
mat
therefore
go
and
make
disciples
of
all
nations
baptizing
them
inﬁ
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
spirit
mat
and
teaching
them
to
obey
everything
i
have
commanded
you
and
surely
i
am
with
you
always
to
the
very
end
of
the
age
also
jesus
speaking
act
for
john
baptized
withﬁ
water
but
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
baptized
with
the
holy
spirit
i
believe
that
you
may
have
overlooked
some
key
verses
that
are
crucial
to
the
christian
faith
