im
not
sure
that
you
can
distinguish
between
myth
and
legend
so
neatly
or
at
all
a
myth
is
more
than
a
single
story
the
thought
structure
and
worldparadigm
in
which
that
story
is
interpreted
is
as
important
a
part
of
the
myth
as
the
story
itself
thus
i
can
think
of
no
story
which
is
meant
to
be
conveyed
understandably
from
one
person
to
another
within
a
single
culture
which
wont
rest
upon
that
underlying
thought
structure
and
thus
transmit
some
of
that
cultures
mythical
truths
along
with
it
