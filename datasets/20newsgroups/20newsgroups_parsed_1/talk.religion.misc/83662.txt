re
biblical
backing
of
koreshs
tape
cites
enclosed
in
article
stephen
writes
for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
ive
enclosed
a
partial
list
of
the
sources
he
cites
or
quotes
he
exactly
used
as
a
christian
sermon
its
pretty
good
if
not
inspired
though
i
differ
in
part
on
some
of
his
conclusions
the
argument
he
presents
is
well
backed
which
is
why
its
taken
me
this
long
to
work
through
still
ongoing
if
you
thought
it
was
rambling
that
says
far
more
about
you
than
it
does
koresh
there
is
a
very
definite
relationship
between
the
youve
made
me
curious
what
does
this
say
about
me
first
seal
in
revelation
the
entirety
of
psalms
and
the
most
of
revelation
which
demonstrated
one
of
his
major
points
about
how
the
writings
in
the
prophets
including
david
and
in
the
psalms
and
in
revelation
are
all
telling
the
same
story
when
you
understand
how
theyre
related
ie
have
the
key
the
largely
explain
each
other
charles
manson
used
revelation
as
well
do
we
see
a
pattern
here
i
wonder
of
koresh
liked
the
beatles
the
sequence
following
is
keyed
to
the
koresh
tape
should
you
care
to
check
it
out
you
can
almost
see
the
note
cards
he
used
when
doing
the
analysis
long
list
of
biblical
references
which
impressed
me
tremendously
but
were
deleted
in
the
interests
of
common
sense
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
just
because
he
found
ways
for
the
bible
to
backup
his
rantings
does
not
make
him
any
less
of
a
kook
seems
to
me
koresh
is
yet
another
messenger
that
got
killed
for
the
message
he
carried
ill
type
this
very
slowly
so
that
you
can
understand
he
either
set
the
fire
himself
or
told
his
followers
to
do
so
dont
make
him
out
to
be
a
martyr
he
did
not
get
killed
he
killed
himself
in
the
mean
time
we
sure
learned
a
lot
about
evil
and
corruption
are
you
surprised
things
have
gotten
that
rotten
the
evil
was
inside
the
compound
all
that
thou
shalt
not
kill
stuff
oh
yeah
one
last
point
for
the
believers
philippian
for
the
rest
of
us
could
you
please
post
the
text
