mr
clinton
said
today
that
the
horrible
tragedy
of
the
waco
fiasco
should
remind
those
who
join
cults
of
the
dangers
of
doing
so
now
i
began
scratching
my
head
thinking
a
bad
sign
dont
the
mainstream
religions
in
this
case
christianityor
the
th
day
adventist
in
particular
just
keep
these
guys
going
isnt
mr
clinton
condemning
his
own
religion
after
all
isnt
it
a
cult
too
a
good
point
what
helps
to
keep
such
things
going
is
the
public
attitude
that
one
should
have
faith
that
some
authority
from
on
high
should
not
be
subjected
to
mere
reason
couple
this
with
a
variety
of
personality
quirks
mojor
and
minor
mental
illnesses
and
ego
of
wouldbe
leaders
and
you
get
all
the
variety
of
cults
and
religions
that
people
subscribe
to
