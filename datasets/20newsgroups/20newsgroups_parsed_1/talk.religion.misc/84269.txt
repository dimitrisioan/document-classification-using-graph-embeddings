no
i
also
understand
it
i
have
read
the
bible
from
cover
to
cover
examining
each
book
within
crosscomparing
them
etc
and
i
have
come
to
same
conclusions
as
robert
weiss
so
rick
why
not
read
the
bible
for
yourself
it
is
written
in
plain
english
decide
for
yourself
im
curious
to
know
if
christians
ever
read
books
based
on
critique
on
the
religion
classical
text
such
as
age
of
reason
by
paine
or
the
myth
maker
by
jacobi
sometimes
it
is
good
to
know
your
enemy
and
if
you
want
to
do
serious
research
you
have
to
understand
both
sides
and
not
solely
the
one
and
only
right
one
