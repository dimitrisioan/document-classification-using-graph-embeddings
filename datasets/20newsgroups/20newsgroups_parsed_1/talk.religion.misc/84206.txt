subject
theory
on
david
koresh
my
theory
is
that
koresh
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
initial
gunbattle
and
died
on
day
of
the
siege
on
day
of
the
siege
he
rose
from
the
dead
and
periodically
appeared
to
his
followers
and
the
fbi
over
the
next
days
living
with
someone
whos
risen
from
the
dead
isnt
easy
as
timmy
batermans
father
in
petsematary
could
attest
so
after
days
they
did
what
baterman
didshot
themselves
and
burned
the
place
to
the
ground
consistent
with
the
facts
isnt
it
did
anyone
actually
see
koresh
between
day
and
day
david
w
ash
what
profits
a
man
if
he
keeps
his
eternal
soul
when
he
could
have
lived
life
to
the
full
and
home
been
forgiven
at
the
end
of
it
all
anyway
