i
thought
that
saturnalia
was
celebrated
by
the
romans
at
that
time
was
mithras
connected
with
this
i
also
heard
the
romans
had
a
large
solar
festival
on
this
day
because
this
day
about
days
after
the
winter
solstice
was
when
you
could
notice
a
change
in
the
shadows
and
be
sure
that
the
sun
was
indeed
returning
in
fact
i
remember
the
latin
phrase
natalis
solis
invicti
sp
associated
here
i
cant
say
for
certain
when
saturnalia
was
since
i
cant
