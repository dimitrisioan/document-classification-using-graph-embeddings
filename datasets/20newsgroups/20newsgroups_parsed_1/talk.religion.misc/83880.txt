john

i
learned
that
god
loves
his
children
who
have
never
heard
of
him
and
has
a
plan
for
redeeming
them
too
even
those
who
have
died
without
a
knowledge
of
christ
i
learned
that
a
man
can
not
frustrate
justice
by
repenting
on
his
death
bed
because
repentance
is
more
than
a
feeling
of
remorse
it
requires
faith
in
christ
proven
by
following
him
by
keeping
his
commandments
such
can
not
be
accomplished
on
ones
deathbed
so
jesus
must
have
lied
to
the
thief
on
the
cross
paradise
and
salvation
are
not
the
same
thing
salvation
is
better
refer
to
john
i
dont
see
the
effort
to
equate
salvation
with
paradise
rather
i
see
implied
the
fact
that
only
those
who
are
saved
may
enter
paradise
