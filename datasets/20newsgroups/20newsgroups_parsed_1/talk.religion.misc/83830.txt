hating
the
sin
but
not
the
sinner
what
are
the
consequences
of
the
homophobic
ranting
of
the
selfrighteous
well
i
just
noted
this
on
another
group
and
thought
id
pass
it
along
the
context
is
talkorigins
and
a
report
of
yet
another
debate
that
was
nothing
but
an
attempt
at
mindless
bullying
and
factless
assertion
by
a
standardissue
creationist
the
writer
reflects
that
the
behavior
reported
reminds
him
of
some
christian
groups
he
has
known
i
believe
that
the
writer
is
a
nonhomosexual
christian
there
is
a
very
effective
technique
used
to
promote
unit
cohesion
among
the
soldiers
of
the
lord
it
is
called
witnessing
ive
seen
this
process
used
well
and
poorly
the
near
devil
worship
i
mention
was
a
group
that
was
using
the
witnessing
to
get
people
lathered
up
to
go
kill
homosexuals
or
at
least
terrorize
them
off
campus
as
it
was
clearly
gods
will
that
they
do
so
i
have
deleted
the
specifics
of
the
location
as
i
do
not
believe
it
characteristic
of
the
place
a
state
in
which
i
spent
my
formative
first
years
though
it
does
have
unfortunately
a
subpopulation
that
this
remark
fits
to
a
tee
michael
l
siemon
i
say
you
are
gods
sons
of
the
most
high
all
of
you
nevertheless
or
you
shall
die
like
men
and
fall
like
any
prince
