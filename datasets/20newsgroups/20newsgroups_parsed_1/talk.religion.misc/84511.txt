yeah
in
a
fire
that
reportedly
burned
hotter
than
degrees
hot
enough
to
make
the
bodies
still
unidentifiable
the
authorities
found
a
gun
that
was
recognizably
fullyautomatic
and
state
of
the
art
isnt
that
conveeeenient
assuming
the
most
favorable
interpretation
of
your
degree
measurement
that
the
temperature
is
in
centigrade
rather
than
the
more
common
in
the

fahrenheit
you
are
still
laboring
under
at
least
misconceptions
you
seem
to
believe
that
steel
melts
somewhere
around
c
actually
the
melting
point
of
most
iron
alloys
and
steels
are
iron
alloys
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
c
even
if
the
gun
were
found
in
area
which
achieved
the
c
temperature
the
steel
parts
of
the
gun
would
not
be
deformed
and
it
would
still
be
trivial
to
identify
the
nature
of
the
weapon
steel
may
not
melt
at
c
but
it
will
weaken
expand
and
deform
if
there
is
enough
of
a
load
on
the
steel
like
the
load
on
a
steel
roof
truss
or
the
pressure
exerted
by
steel
parts
in
a
machine
trying
to
expand
against
each
other
the
steel
can
and
will
deform
extensively
for
the
record
any
weapon
found
in
the
cult
compound
should
be
indentifiable
but
it
may
be
impossible
to
do
normal
ballistics
tests
because
of
the
damage
done
to
the
weapon
if
if
if
anyway
the
question
was
if
the
gun
was
identifiable
which
it
