re
merlin
mithras
and
magick
what
an
exciting
thread
finally
mitra
is
sanskrit
for
friend
as
such
he
started
out
as
an
avatar
of
lord
visnu
mentioned
first
in
the
vedas
later
he
seems
to
have
risen
to
chief
prominence
worshipped
by
the
persians
associated
with
the
sun
but
not
the
sun
he
is
the
lord
of
contract
honor
and
obedience
therefore
naturally
worshipped
by
soldiers
he
was
ordered
by
the
sun
to
slay
the
bull
of
heaven
and
he
reluct
antly
agreed
because
of
his
obligationthe
blood
of
that
bull
spilled
and
grew
all
earth
lifethen
mitra
and
the
sun
sat
down
to
eat
worship
of
lord
mitra
ended
in
persia
with
the
ascension
of
the
zoroastrians
hundreds
of
years
later
he
was
rediscovered
and
thrown
into
the
official
roman
pantheon
tm
for
some
semitricky
reason
i
forget
why
but
all
references
of
him
ended
abruptly
when
he
was
stricken
from
same
so
apparently
his
worship
was
some
sort
of
vehicle
for
advancement
in
the
bureaucracy
like
membership
in
the
communist
party
was
in
the
soviet
bloc
the
sociology
of
religion
in
ancient
times
is
fascinating
oh
his
bday
was
dec
ahem
i
am
not
sure
if
the
mystery
cult
really
lasted
after
his
was
booted
from
the
roman
imperial
god
roster
or
what
it
contained
mostly
soldiers
with
levels
of
initiation
they
worshipped
underground
in
caverns
in
pews
the
bull
horns
in
those
temples
were
for
scaring
away
or
impaling
evil
spirits
im
not
sure
that
they
had
mithraic
significance
or
not
i
dont
know
that
the
ritual
meal
was
of
a
cannibalistic
nature
as
is
the
christian
masses
but
eating
deities
goes
way
back
to
old
kingdom
egypt
someone
mentioned
bullfighting
did
mithraists
sacrifice
bulls
i
forget
more
likely
for
a
religious
source
might
be
the
shower
of
bulls
blood
enjoyed
by
the
worshippers
of
cybele
on
the
day
of
blood
cybele
worship
extended
all
throughout
even
up
to
france
