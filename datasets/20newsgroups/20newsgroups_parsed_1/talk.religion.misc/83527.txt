question
is
there
any
effective
difference
between
objective
values
exist
and
there
is
disagreement
over
what
they
are
and
values
are
subjective
i
dont
see
any
the
first
means
that
some
aspect
of
reality
contains
objective
values
the
second
means
that
values
are
a
reference
to
some
preference
of
the

the
first
case
it

possible
that
some
future
discovery
might
invalidate
certain
views
re
what
objective

are
