re
a
message
for
you
mr
president
how
do
you
know
what
happened
timothy
j
brent
writes
probably
not
but
then
i
dont
pack
heavy
weaponry
with
intent
to
use
it
you
dont
really
think
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
keep
that
stuff
do
you
if
so
tell
me
where
you
live
so
i
can
be
sure
to
steer
well
clear
i
understand
that
they
had
the
neccessary
licenses
and
permits
to
own
automatic
weapons
the
public
also
has
rights
and
they
should
be
placed
above
those
of
the
individual
go
ahead
call
me
a
commie
but
youd
be
singing
a
different
tune
if
i
exercised
my
right
to
rape
your
daughter
he
broke
the
law
he
was
a
threat
to
society
they
did
there
job
simple
i
havent
seen
any
proof
or
even
evidence
that
the
bds
had
broken
the
law
if
you
have
proof
or
evidence
lets
hear
it
the
fbi
said
so
is
not
evidence
ill
support
them
all
except
no
i
guess
there
will
always
be
people
who
wish
to
be
peasants
the
politicians
prefer
unarmed
peasants
