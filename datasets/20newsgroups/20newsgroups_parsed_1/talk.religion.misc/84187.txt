no
news
is
bad
news
im
having
trouble
receiving
news
at
the
moment
due
to
an
overloaded
news
server
i
think
that
i
can
post
out
reasonably
quickly
though
im
in
a
couple
of
threads
at
the
moment
which
may
be
pending
replies
if
anyone
wants
a
reply
from
me
over
something
ive
posted
then
i
suggest
sending
an
email
copy
of
the
point
to
me
so
that
i
can
reply
by
news
this
is
one
way
to
shut
me
up
cheers

oh
where
is
the
sea
the
fishes
cried
as
they
swam
its
clearness
