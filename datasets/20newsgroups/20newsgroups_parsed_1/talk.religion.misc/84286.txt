robert
you
keep
making
references
to
orthodox
belief
and
saying
things
like
it
is
held
that
cf
kermit
thread
on
what
exact
body
of
theology
are
you
drawing
for
what
you
call
orthodox
who
is
that
holds
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
whenever
your
personal
interpretation
of
biblical
passages
is
challenged
your
only
response
seems
to
be
that
one
needs
merely
to
look
at
the
bible
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
see
biblical
things
differently
from
you
are
we
to
simply
assume
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
understands
it
rick
i
think
we
can
safely
say
robert
is
not
the
only
person
who
understands
the
bible
and
the
leadership
of
the
lds
church
historicly
never
has
lets
consider
some
personal
interpretations
and
see
how
much
trust
we
should
put
in
orthodox
mormonism
which
could
never
be
confused
with
orthodox
christianity
in
one
of
his
attacks
on
christians
the
mormon
apostle
bruce
r
mcconkie
said
they
thrash
around
indarkness
in
trying
to
identify
elohim
and
jehovah
and
to
show
their
relationship
to
the
promised
messiah
he
also
said
christians
are
wrong
to
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
god
the
father
and
that
christ
came
into
mortality
as
his
only
begotten
son
mcconkie
then
stated
what
mormons
believe
today
to
be
the
truth
about
the
matter
he
said
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
jehovah
is
the
son
being
thus
aware
of
how
far
astray
the
religious
intellectualists
have
gone
in
defining
their
threeinone
god
it
comes
as
no
surprise
to
learn
that
they
thrash
around
in
the
same
darkness
in
trying
to
identify
elohim
and
jehovah
and
to
show
their
relationship
to
the
promised
messiah
some
sectarians
even
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
whose
son
came
into
mortality
as
the
only
begotten
as
with
their
concept
that
god
is
a
spirit
this
misinformation
about
the
gods
of
heaven
is
untrue
the
fact
is
and
it
too
is
attested
by
holy
writ
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
that
jehovah
is
the
son
who
was
born
into
mortality
as
the
lord
jesus
christ
the
promised
messiah
promised
messiah
p
notice
that
mcconkie
said
the
christians
are
as
wrong
about
their
threeinone
god
and
their
belief
that
god
is
a
spirit
as
they
are
in
their
understanding
of
who
elohim
and
jehovah
are
before
examining
mcconkies
attack
and
its
validity
we
shall
read
a
few
more
statements
by
mcconkie
and
other
mormon
sources
concerning
the
words
elohim
and
jehovah
mcconkie
stated
the
chief
designation
of
christ
that
has
been
preserved
for
us
in
the
old
testament
as
that
ancient
work
is
now
published
is

though
it
is
is
also
used
as
the

eternal

a
usage
that
connotes
his
supremacy
and
omnipotence
he
being
god
above
all
gods
mormon
doctrine
p
agreeing
with
mcconkie
on
the
question
of
who
elohim
and
jehovah
are
the
apostle
james
e
talmage
stated
elohim
as
understood
and
used
in
the
restored
church
of
jesus
christ
is
the
nametitle
of
god
the
eternal
father
whose
firstborn
son
in
the
spirit
is

only

jesus
christ
jesus
the
christ
p
a
doctrinal
exposition
by
the
first
presidency
and
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
mormon
church
states
that
god
the
eternal

designated
by
the
exalted
nametitle

christ
in
his
preexistent
antemortal
or
unembodied
statewas
known
as

articles
of
faith
p
today
mormon
leaders
teach
that
elohim
in
the
ot
refers
to
god
the
father
and
jehovah
refers
to
christ
mcconkie
attacked
christians
for
saying
jehovah
can
refer
to
the
father
he
stressed
that
these
two
nametitles
should
not
be
changed
around
so
that
christ
is
called
elohim
and
the
father
is
called
jehovah
the
fatheris
elohim
not
jehovah
jehovah
is
christ
and
christ
is
jehovah
they
are
one
and
the
same
person
promised
messiah
p
in
the
ot
of
the
kjv
of
the
bible
the
hebrew
word
elohim
is
used
to
refer
to
the
true
god
false
gods
and
goddesses
and
the
judges
of
israel
when
referring
to
the
true
god
elohim
is
translated
with
a
capital
g
when
referring
to
false
gods
and
goddesses
and
the
judges
of
israel
it
is
translated
with
a
small
g
it
is
translated
four
times
as
judges
exod
once
as
judge
sam
twice
as
mighty

exod
once
as

ps
once
as
godly
mal
once
as
great

and
once
as
very
great
sam
the
word
jehovah
is
the
traditional
pronunciation
of
the
tetragrammation
yhwh
or
yhvh
with
the
vowel
points
taken
from
the
word
adonai
many
people
believe
the
true
pronunciation
of
the
tetragrammation
was
yahweh
or
yahveh
however
since
jehovah
rather
than
yahweh
is
the
word
used
by
mormonism
this
section
will
also
use
jehovah
instead
of
yahweh
to
examine
the
validity
of
the
claims
of
mormon
leaders
regarding
that
name
jehovah
unlike
elohim
is
never
used
of
false
gods
it
is
the
personal
name
of
the
triune
god
of
the
bible
in
the
kjv
jehovah
is
rendered
primarily
lord
sometimes
god
and
rarely
lord
now
that
we
understand
something
about
the
words
elohim
and
jehovah
and
their
use
by
mormon
leaders
we
shall
consider
the
apostle
mcconkies
attack
on
christians
for
believing
the
father
is
jehovah
in
trying
to
prove
that
jehovah
refers
exclusively
to
christ
mcconkie
cited
several
verses
from
the
bible
some
of
these
verses
and
mcconkies
interpretation
of
them
will
be
examined
to
see
whether
he
was
right
remember
mcconkie
said
the
father
is
not
jehovah
he
is
only
elohim
the
first
example
we
shall
consider
involves
mcconkies
interpretation
of
ps
of
this
verse
he
stated
of
whom
spake
david
when
his
tongue
was
touched
by
the
holy
spirit
and
he
testified
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
ps
two
lords
are
here
involved
one
is
speaking
to
the
other
one
is
greater
than
the
other
one
is
making
provision
for
the
triumph
and
glory
of
the
other
who
are
they
and
what
message
is
contained
in
this
messianic
prophecy
what
think
ye
of
christ
our
lord
asked
certain
of
his
detractors
toward
the
end
of
his
mortal
ministry
whose
son
is
he
is
christ
the
son
of
god
or
of
someone
else
is
he
to
be
born
of
a
divine
parent
or
will
he
be
as
other
men
a
mortal
son
of
a
mortal
father
that
he
was
to
be
a
descendant
of
david
was
a
matter
of
great
pride
to
all
the
jews
and
so
they
answered
the
son
of
david
davids
son
truly
he
was
but
he
was
more
much
more
and
so
our
lord
with
irrefutable
logic
and
to
their
complete
discomfiture
asked
how
then
doth
david
in
spirit
call
him
lord
saying
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
if
david
then
call
him
lord
how
is
he
his
son
that
is
if
he
is
only
the
son
of
david
how
is
it
that
the
great
king
acting
under
inspiration
calls
him
lord
and
worships
him
as
such
and
we
might
add
who
is
the
other
lord
the
one
who
spake
unto
davids
lord
can
there
be
any
question
as
to
how
jesus
is
interpreting
the
words
of
the
psalm
he
is
saying
that
it
means
the
father
said
unto
the
son
elohim
said
unto
jehovah
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
until
after
your
mortal
ministry
then
i
will
raise
you
up
to
eternal
glory
and
exaltation
with
me
where
you
will
continue
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
forever
promised
messiah
pp
emphasis
added
agreeing
with
the
above
statement
by
mcconkie
the
following
remark
in
the
mormon
pamphlet
what
the
mormons
think
of
christ
p
reads
the
lord
elohim
the
father
said
unto
my
lord
jehovah
the
son
brackets
in
original
mcconkie
clearly
stated
that
it
is
elohim
the
father
who
is
speaking
to
jehovah
the
son
in
this
psalm
however
when
one
looks
at
the
hebrew
word
translated
lord
it
becomes
apparent
that
either
the
first
lord
is
not
the
father
or
else
the
father
is
jehovah
either
way
mcconkie
is
wrong
the
psalm
reads
the
lord
jehovah
said
unto
my
lord
adon
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
ps
the
first
lord
in
this
verse
is
jehovah
who
mormonism
says
is
christ
not
the
father
the
second
lord
is
the
hebrew
word
adon
singular
for
adonai
meaning
master
or
lord
if
the
first
lord
is
the
father
and
the
second
lord
is
the
son
then
the
father
is
jehovah
and
the
son
is
adon
however
if
the
father
is
not
jehovah
as
mcconkie
claimed
then
the
first
lord
is
jehovah
the
son
but
who
then
is
adon
obviously
the
father
is
jehovah
in
this
psalm
and
his
son
is
adon
another
example
involves
isa
about
which
mcconkie
stated
the
following
i
the
lord
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
isaiah
quoted
the
father
as
saying
of
christ
and
will
hold
thine
hand
and
will
keep
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
isa
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
mcconkie
said
the
father
was
speaking
of
christ
in
this
passage
which
reads
i
the
lord
jehovah
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
and
will
hold
thine
hand
and
will
keep
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
isa
according
to
mcconkie
i
the
lord
refers
to
the
father
and
thine
and
thee
refer
to
christ
however
the
lord
who
is
speaking
is
jehovah
which
means
either
mcconkie
was
wrong
about
who
is
speaking
or
else
the
father
is
jehovah
another
example
involves
ps
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
the
same
psalm
says
all
they
that
see
me
laugh
me
to
scorn
they
shoot
out
the
lip
they
shake
the
head
saying
he
trusted
on
the
lord
that
he
would
deliver
him
let
him
deliver
him
seeing
he
delighted
in
him
ps
the
fulfillment
as
jesus
hung
on
the
cross
is
found
in
these
words
the
chief
priests
mocking
him
with
the
scribes
and
elders
said
he
saved
others
himself
he
can
not
save
if
he
be
the
king
of
israel
let
him
now
come
down
from
the
cross
and
we
will
believe
him
he
trusted
in
god
let
him
deliver
him
now
if
he
will
have
him
for
he
said
i
am
the
son
of
god
the
thieves
also
which
were
crucified
with
him
cast
the
same
in
his
teeth
matt
promised

pp
emphasis
added
ps
reads
as
follows
all
they
that

mcconkie
said
these
verses
had
their
fulfillment
as
jesus
hung
on
the
cross
that
means
the
person
who
was
scorned
in
these
verses
was
christ
who
then
was
the
lord
in
whom
he
trusted
it
was
jehovah
the
father
another
example
involves
ps
and
ps
regarding
them
mcconkie
stated
the
following
with
reference
to
the
conniving
and
conspiring
plots
incident
to
our
lords
arrest
and
judicial
trials
the
prophecy
was
they
took
counsel
together
against
me
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life
ps
as
to
the
role
of
judas
in
those
conspiracies
the
psalmist
says
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
ps
promised
messiah
p
apostle
mcconkie
said
these
psalms
refer
to
christs
arrest
and
judicial
trials
we
shall
first
consider
ps
and
then
ps
while
mcconkie
only
quoted
verse
of
ps
verse
will
also
be
included
to
give
a
complete
understanding
of
the
matter
for
i
have
heard
the
slander
of
many
fear
was
on
every
side
while
they
took
counsel
together
against
me
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life
but
i
trusted
in
thee
o
lord
jehovah
i
said
thou
art
my
god
elohim
ps
mcconkie
said
verse
referred
to
jesus
christ
verse
goes
on
to
tell
that
he
christ
trusted
in
the
lord
who
is
called
his
god
or
elohim
mormonism
teaches
that
the
god
above
jesus
is
elohim
the
father
verse
however
reveals
that
the
elohim
of
the
man
jesus
is
jehovah
the
father
in
ps
mcconkie
only
quoted
one
verse
however
two
verses
will
be
considered
in
this
examination
yea
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
but
thou
o
lord
jehovah
be
merciful
unto
me
and
raise
me
up
that
i
may
requite
them
ps
mcconkie
stated
above
that
verse
referred
to
judas
role
in
christs
death
since
it
was
judas
who
was
the
familiar
friend
who
lifted
up
his
heel
the
pronouns
mine
i
my
and
me
in
verse
must
refer
to
christ
notice
that
at
the
beginning
of
verse
there
is
a
change
of
pronoun
to
thou
which
refers
to
the
lord
jehovah
then
the
pronouns
me
and
i
which
refer
to
christ
are
used
again
that
means
christ
was
speaking
to
jehovah
the
father
in
these
verses
another
example
involves
mcconkies
following
remark
about
ps
one
of
the
great
messianic
prophecies
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
david
says
the
lord
hath
sworn
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
ps
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
admitted
this
is
a
messianic
prophecy
involving
christ
the
question
is
what
in
this
verse
refers
to
christ
the
lord
jehovah
hath
sworn
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
ps
does
the
lord
which
is
jehovah
refer
to
christ
if
mcconkie
is
right
and
jesus
is
jehovah
but
the
father
is
not
then
the
lord
would
have
to
refer
to
christ
but
who
then
is
the
one
addressed
as
the
priest
forever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
the
bible
reveals
that
the
one
referred
to
is
jesus
christ
heb
therefore
the
lord
jehovah
in
ps
is
the
father
another
example
involves
isa
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
of
the
atoning
sacrifice
of
the
future
messiah
isaiah
said
the
lord
has
laid
on
him
the
iniquities
of
us
all
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
mcconkie
rightly
said
these
verses
refer
to
the
atoning
sacrifice
of
the
future
messiah
however
what
he
failed
to
mention
is
that
they
also
prove
that
the
father
is
jehovah
verse
reads
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
jehovah
hath
laid
on
him
christ
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
verse
reads
yet
it
pleased
the
lord
jehovah
to
bruise
him
christ
obviously
the
lord
who
laid
on
christ
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
who
bruised
him
is
god
the
father
who
is
called
jehovah
in
these
verses
remember
mcconkie
stated
that
some
sectarians
even
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
and
that
christ
came
into
mortality
as
his
only
begotten
son
he
called
this
concept
misinformation
that
is
untrue
to
prove
that
it
is
mcconkie
who
is
misinformed
and
believing
untruth
two
scriptural
references
sam
ps
will
be
examined
mcconkie
stated
the
following
regarding
these
scriptures
in
the
midst
of
a
passage
that
is
clearly
messianic
the
lord
says
of
the
seed
of
david
i
will
be

these
verses
teach
that
the
lord
jehovah
would
have
a
son
the
messiah
in
the
second
example
mcconkie
cited
ps
this
examination
will
include
verse
notice
that
it
is
the
lord
jehovah
who
says
thou
art
my

this

thine

and
the
uttermost
parts

earth
for
thy
possession
mcconkie
said
these
verses
of
scripture
are
clearly
messianic
and
he
acknowledged
they
teach
that
christ
would
come
as
the
son
of
god
what
he
is
not
willing
to
acknowledge
however
is
that
these
scriptures
also
teach
that
the
father
is
jehovah
and
that
the
sectarians
who
believe
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
whose
son
is
jesus
christ
the
only
begotten
are
right
in
their
belief
another
example
involves
mic
of
this
verse
mcconkie
stated
the
following
and
so
truly
did
our
lord
act
during
his
mortal
ministry
truly
this
is
he
of
whom
it
is
written
he
shall
stand
and
feed
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
in
the
majesty
of
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
for
now
shall
he
be
great
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
mic
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
according
to
mcconkie
the
pronoun
he
at
the
beginning
of
mic
refers
to
christ
during
his
mortal
ministry
who
then
is
the
lord
his
god
mic
reads
and
he
christ
shall
stand
and
feed
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
jehovah
in
the
majesty
of
the
name
of
the
lord
jehovah
his
god
elohim
for
now
shall
he
be
great
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
obviously
the
lord
of
jesus
christ
is
jehovah
the
father
who
is
referred
to
as
jehovah
his
elohim
another
example
involves
ps
and
isa
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
the
following
a
number
of
messianic
passages
speak
of
the
lord
andhis
anointed
ps
signifying
that
the
chosen
one
was
consecrated
and
set
apart
for
the
ministry
and
mission
that
was
his
jesus
applied
these
passages
to
himself
by
quoting
isaiahs
prophecy
the
lord
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
isa
and
then
saying
this
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
luke
promised
messiah
pp
emphasis
added
the
first
source
mcconkie
quoted
ps
reads
as
follows
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
jehovah
and
against
his
anointed
mcconkie
said
the
anointed
one
was
christ
if
that
is
true
who
was
jehovah
if
jehovah
is
always
christ
who
was
the
anointed
one
obviously
jehovah
is
referring
to
god
the
father
and
the
anointed
is
indeed
referring
to
christ
the
second
source
mcconkie
cited
is
isa
which
states
the
spirit
of
the
lord
adonai
god
jehovah
is
upon
me
because
the
lord
jehovah
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
he
hath
sent
me
to
bind
up
the
brokenhearted
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives
and
the
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
are
bound
the
one
who
was
anointed
to
preach
bind
up
proclaim
and
open
was
jesus
christ
who
then
was
the
one
who
anointed
him
this
verse
says
the
lord
jehovah
did
the
anointing
again
we
face
the
same
problem
if
jehovah
does
not
refer
to
the
father
but
only
to
christ
then
jesus
anointed
someone
but
who
as
mcconkie
pointed
out
jesus
applied
these
passages
to
himself
therefore
the
jehovah
who
anointed
christ
is
god
the
father
other
examples
could
be
cited
to
show
that
mcconkie
and
other
mormon
leaders
are
wrong
when
they
say
god
the
father
is
not
jehovah
however
these
should
be
enough
to
expose
their
error
now
what
about
mormonisms
claim
that
jesus
is
jehovah
but
he
is
not
elohim
it
is
true
that
jesus
is
jehovah
the
following
scriptures
prove
this
fact

mormon

emphasis
added
another
error
by
bruce

involving
jehovah

of
the
noble

children

evident
from

vol
pp
mormon
doctrine
p
the
bible
reveals
the
truth
about
this
matter
thus
saith
the
lord
jehovah
thy
redeemer
and
he
that
formed
thee
from
the

i
am
the

out

treadeth

job
jehovah
by
himself
created
all
things
he
had
no
alleged
preexistent
spirit
helpers
assisting
him
regarding
the
mormon
elohim
the
apostle
mcconkie
stated
elohim
plural
word
though
it
is
is
also
used
as
the
exalted
nametitle
of
god
the
eternal
father
a
usage
that
connotes
his
supremacy
and
omnipotence
he
being
god
above
all
gods
mormon
doctrine
p
he
also
stated
that
jesusis
above
all
save
the
father
only
promised
messiah
p
the
bible
states
that
the
one
who
is
god
above
all
socalled
gods
is
the
triune
god
jehovah
for
the
lord
jehovah
is
a
great
god
el
and
a
great
king
above
all
gods
elohim
ps
for
thou
lord
jehovah
art
high
above
all
the
earth
thou
art
exalted
far
above
all
gods
elohim
ps
now
i
know
that
the
lord
jehovah
is
greater
than
all
gods
elohim
exod
see
also
ps
deut
if
mormon
leaders
are
right
when
they
say
jehovah
is
god
the
son
and
elohim
is
god
the
father
these
verses
from
the
bible
would
be
teaching
that
the
mormon
son
is
above
his
father
however
as
mcconkie
clearly
stated
mormons
believe
elohim
the
father
not
jehovah
the
son
is
the
god
above
all
gods
that
jesus
is
above
all
except
the
father
yet
the
bible
teaches
that
jehovah
is
above
all
elohim
at
a
byu
dev
on
march
bruce
r
mcconkie
made
the
following
remark
about
praying
to
jesus
another
peril
is
that
those
so
involved
often
begin
to
pray
directly
to
christ
because
of
some
special
friendship
they
feel
has
been
developed
this
is
plain
sectarian
nonsense
our
prayers
are
addressed
to
the
father
and
to
him
only
perfect
prayer
is
addressed
to
the
father
in
the
name
of
the
son
it
is
uttered
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
our
relationship
with
the
lord
pp
mcconkie
states
on
p
of
his
book
promised
messiah
that
the
mormons
pray
to
the
father
not
the
son
on
p
of
the
same
book
mcconkie
states
that
christ
the
son
is
jehovah
this
is
important
to
remember
because
although
mcconkie
said
prayer
is
not
to
be
offered
to
the
mormon
christ
who
is
jehovah
the
bible
states
repeatedly
in
the
ot
that
people
prayed
to
jehovah
and
he
not
only
heard
those
prayers
but
he
accepted
them
as
valid
requests
the
following
is
but
a
small
sample
of
the
vast
number
of
times
people
prayed
to
jehovah
in
my
distress
i
called
upon
the
lord
jehovah
and
cried
unto
my
god
elohim
he
heard
my
voice
out
of
his
temple
and
my
cry
came
before
him
even
into
his
ears
ps
and
the
lord
jehovah
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
that
thou
hast
made
before
me
i
have
hallowed
this
house
which
thou
hast
built
to
put
my
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
kin
and
said
unto
jeremiah
the
prophet
let
we
beseech
thee
our
supplication
be
accepted
before
thee
and
pray
for
us
unto
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim
even
for
all
this
remnant
jer
o
lord
jehovah
i
beseech
thee
let
now
thine
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servants
who
desire
to
fear
thy
name
neh
and
it
was
so
that
when
solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying
all
this
prayer
and
supplication
unto
the
lord
jehovah
he
arose
from
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
jehovah
from
kneeling
on
his
knees
with
his
hands
spread
up
to
heaven
kin
he
went
in
therefore
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
twain
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
jehovah
kin
go
and
say
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
lord
jehovah
the
god
elohim
of
david
thy
father
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
i
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years
isa
i
acknowledge
my
sin
unto
thee
and
mine
iniquity
have
i
not
hid
i
said
i
will
confess
my
transgressions
unto
the
lord
jehovah
and
thou
forgavest
the
iniquity
of
my
sin
for
this
shall
every
one
that
is
godly
pray
unto
thee
in
a
time
when
thou
mayest
be
found
ps
notice
above
in
ps
that
the
godly
pray
to
jehovah
according
to
mcconkie
and
other
mormon
leaders
that
is
christ
the
very
one
to
whom
mcconkie
said
people
should
not
pray
the
bible
reveals
there
is
only
one
true
elohim
and
his
name
is
jehovah
all
other
elohim
are
false
they
are
idols
that
cause
their
followers
to
commit
adultery
against
the
true
elohim
and
idolatry
for
the
lord
jehovah
is
great
and
greatly
to
be
praised
he
is
to
be
feared
above
all
gods
elohim
for
all
the
gods
elohim
of
the
nations
are
idols
but
the
lord
jehovah
made
the
heavens
ps
thou
shalt
have
no
other

elohim
before

exod
now
i
know

it
shall
be

thou
do
at

forget
the

thy

i
testify
against

this

ye
shall

thou
shalt
make
no
covenant

them

with

gods
elohim

shall
not
dwell
in
thy
land
lest
they
make
thee
sin
against
me
for
if
thou
serve
their
gods
elohim
it
will
surely
be
a
snare
unto
thee
exod
take
heed
to
yourselves
that
your
heart
be
not
deceived
and
ye
turn
aside
and
serve
other
gods
elohim
and
worship
them
deut
that
ye
come
not
among
these
nations
these
that
remain
among
you
neither
make
mention
of
the
name
of
their
gods
elohim
nor
cause
to
swear
by
them
neither
serve
them
nor
bow
yourselves
unto
them
josh
neither
walk
after
other
gods
elohim
to
your
hurt
jer
but
the
lord
jehovah
is
the
true
god
elohim
he
is
the
living
god
elohim
jer
and
they
forsook
the
lord
jehovah
god
elohim
of
their
fathers
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
followed
other
gods
elohim
of
the
gods
elohim
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
them
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
and
provoked
the
lord
jehovah
to
anger
jud
shall
a
man
make
gods
elohim
unto
himself
and
they
are
no
gods
elohim
therefore
behold
i
will
this
once
cause
them
to
know
i
will
cause
them
to
know
mine
hand
and
my
might
and
they
shall
know
that
my
name
is
the
lord
jehovah
jer
and
if
it
seem
evil
unto
you
to
serve
the
lord
jehovah
choose
you
this
day
whom
ye
will
serve
whether
the
gods
elohim
which
your
fathers
served
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
or
the
gods
elohim
of
the
amorites
in
whose
land
ye
dwell
but
as
for
me
and
my
house
we
will
serve
the
lord
jehovah
and
the
people
answered
and
said
god
elohim
forbid
that
we
should
forsake
the
lord
jehovah
to
serve
other
gods
elohim
josh
these
verses
teach
that
the
only
true
living
elohim
in
heaven
and
on
earth
is
jehovah
the
triune
god
who
made
heaven
and
earth
and
all
therein
jehovah
is
greater
than
any
elohim
because
all
other
elohim
are
idols
the
reality
behind
them
is
demonic
deut
jehovah
elohim
has
given
explicit
warnings
and
guidelines
regarding
these
false
elohim
he
told
his
people
not
to
have
any
elohim
but
him
he
told
the
people
that
if
they
left
him
for
the
false
elohim
those
elohim
would
be
a
snare
to
them
and
they
would
be
hurt
and
would
perish
he
warned
the
people
to
take
heed
that
their
heart
be
not
deceived
into
worshiping
serving
swearing
by
and
making
covenants
with
false
elohim
jehovah
elohim
told
his
people
he
would
eventually
judge
all
false
elohim
and
their
followers
despite
these
warnings
and
guidelines
elohims
covenant
people
forsook
him
and
believed
in
and
worshiped
the
false
elohims
of
the
people
they
came
in
contact
with
ju
states
that
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
jehovah
and
served
baalim
and
ashtaroth
and
the
gods
elohim
of
syria
and
the
gods
elohim
of
zidon
and
the
gods
elohim
of
moab
and
the
gods
elohim
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
gods
elohim
of
the
philistines
and
forsook
the
lord
jehovah
and
served
not
him
this
examination
has
shown
that
the
elohim
of
mormonism
like
the
elohim
in
ju
is
not
the
true
jehovah
elohim
therefore
the
people
who
leave
the
true
elohim
for
the
mormon
elohim
will
do
evilin
the
sight
of
the
lord
jehovah
although
mcconkie
attacked
christians
for
their
belief
in
a
triune
god
who
is
spirit
and
for
their
belief
that
god
the
father
jehovah
sent
his
son
into
the
world
these
beliefs
are
true
god
is
triune
he
is
spirit
he
is
jehovah
and
he
did
send
his
son
into
the
world
to
redeem
mankind
it
is
obvious
from
this
examination
that
it
is
not
the
christians
who
thrash
around
indarkness
about
who
elohim
and
jehovah
are
one
wonders
what
holy
writ
mcconkie
had
in
mind
when
he
stated
that
it
attests
to
the
fact
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
that
jehovah
is
the
son
he
certainly
did
not
mean
the
bible
which
teaches
that
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
are
all
the
one
jehovah
elohim
he
apparently
did
not
mean
the
dc
either
because
chapter
verses
refer
to
the
father
as
jehovah
summary
obviously
joseph
fielding
smiths
statement
that
the
mormons
have
a
clear
and
perfect
understanding
of
the
nature
of
god
doctrines
of
salvation
is
not
accurate
the
mormon
gods
are
not
the
true
god
as
mormonism
claims
but
are
idols
which
cause
their
followers
to
commit
adultery
against
god
and
idolatry
in
answer
to
jesus
question
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
mormons
say
jesus
is
someone
different
from
the
jesus
who
is
revealed
in
the
bible
and
whom
the
apostles
preached
therefore
anyone
trusting
in
the
mormon
jesus
is
believing
in
another
jesus
whom
paul
warned
about
bernard
p
brockbank
of
the
first
quorum
of
the
seventy
admitted
in
the
may
issue
of
the
ensign
a
mormon
publication
that
the
mormon
jesus
is
different
from
the
christian
jesus
he
stated
that
it
is
true
that
many
of
the
christian
churches
worship
a
different
jesus
christ
than
is
worshipped
by
the
mormons
or
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
p
the
people
who
believe
in
the
mormon
jesus
are
committing
adultery
against
god
and
idolatry
they
do
not
have
the
son
therefore
they
do
not
have
the
father
and
they
do
not
have
eternal
life
as
the
apostle
bruce
r
mcconkie
rightly
stated
salvation
comes
only
by
worshiping
the
true
god
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
also
rightly
stated
that
the
mere
worship
of
a
god
who
has
the
proper
scriptural
names
does
not
assure
one
that
he
is
worshiping
the
true
and
living
god
because
the
true
names
of
deity
can
be
applied
to
false
concepts
of
god
mormon
doctrine
p
remember
that
the
apostle
stephen
l
richards
admitted
that
joseph
smith
jr
gave
a
new
conception
of
god
and
the
godhead
contributions
of
joseph
smith
p
it
is
important
for
the
people
who
have
left
the
true
triune
god
revealed
in
the
bible
to
repent
and
return
to
him
they
must
forsake
the
sins
of
idolatry
and
adultery
which
they
are
committing
in
mormonism
the
bible
says
all
that
forsake
thee
shall
be
ashamed
and
they
that
depart
from
me
shall
be
written
in
the
earth
because
they
have
forsaken
the
lord
jehovah
the
fountain
of
living
waters
jer
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim
and
walk
after
other
gods
elohim
and
serve
them
and
worship
them
i
testify
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
perish
deut
thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
withtheir
gods
elohim
exod
