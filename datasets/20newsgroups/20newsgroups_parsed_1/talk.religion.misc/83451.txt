said
lebanons
mainstream
shiite
muslim
militia
said
thursday
that
it
had
uncovered
a
network
of
tunnels
in
a
southern
lebanese
village
where
it
said
pro
iranian
kidnappers
had
held
western
hostages
officials
of
the
militia
amal
led
local
journalists
through
the
catacomb
like
alleys
and
showed
them
two
cells
with
iron
doors
at
the
village
kawthariyet
al
siyad
near
tyre
the
ancient
port
city
about
miles
south
of
beirut
the
officials
said
they
were
certain
that
us
marine
lt
col
william
r
higgins
was
detained
there
shortly
after
he
was
seized
by
gunmen
on
a
road
outside
tyre
in
february
anyway
i
counted
articles
during
these
years
of
reporting
i
also
found
out
the
possible
reason
why
the
numbers
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
is
defined
between
and
it
seems
that
tyre
is
one
of
the
places
where
people
from
libanon
flee
to
during
more
extensive
bombings
so
theres
a
constant
flow
of
refugees
entering
and
leaving
tyre
articles
mentioned
thousands
of
people
entering
and
leaving
this
place
i
counted
articles
for
my
home
town
kristinestad
so
from
now
i
will
consider
this
place
to
be
a
fishing
village
