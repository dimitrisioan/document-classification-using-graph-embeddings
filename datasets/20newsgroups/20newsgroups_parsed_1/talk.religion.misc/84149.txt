i

some
friends
of
mine
two
weeks
ago
that
koresh
was
dead
the
fbi
and
the
batf
could
not
let
a
man
like
that
live
he
was
a
testimonial
to
their
stupidity
and
lies
deleted
unfortunately
i
think
youve
got
it

pretty
well
i
also
ask
myself
the
question
why
did
they
plan
for
so
many
months
why
was
this
so
important
to
them
what
was
the
government
really
up
to
why
did
they
seal
the
warrant
were
they
after
koresh
or
were
they
after
the
first
and
second
amendments
among
others
we
waited
days
for
our
hostages
to
come
home
from
iran
we
gave
these
people
days
joe
gaut
in
the
superstate

really
does
not
matter
at
all

actually
happened

the
alamo
truth
is
what
the
government
chooses
to
remember
waco
tell
you

is
what
it
wants
to
happen
