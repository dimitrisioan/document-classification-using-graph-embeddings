theres

einstein
and
bohr
have
told
us
that
speaking
as
one
who
knows
relativity
and
quantum

i
say
bullshit
speaking
as
someone
who
also
knows
relativity
and
quantum
mechanics
i
say
go
ahead
punk
make
my
day
my
degree
can
beat
up
your
degree
ok
refer
us
to
the
place
in
einsteins
or
bohrs
writings
where
he
said
theres
no
objective
physics
ah
you
taking
everything
as
literal
quotation
no
wonder
youre
confused
first
can
i
ask
that
we
decide
on
a
definition
of
objective
theres
no
objective
reality
lsd
should
be
sufficient
to
prove
that
speaking
as
one
who
has
taken
lsd
i
say
bullshit
well
ill
have
to
bow
to
your
superior
knowledge
on
that
one
but
i
think
i
detect
a
pattern
in
your
responses
how
about
some
actual
support
for
your
dismissals
you
take
lsd
and
it
skews
your
perception
of
reality
you
come
down
and
your
perceptions
unskew
and
how
could
striving
toward
an
ideal
be
in
any
way
useful
if
the
ideal
had
no
objective
existence
a
perfectly
efficient
power
station
would
convert
all
of
the
energy
in
coal
into
electricity
there
is
absolutely
no
way
we
can
build
a
perfect
power
station
its
an
ideal
but
striving
towards
that
ideal
is
undeniably
useful
and
valuable
is
it
not
ok
let
me
narrow
the
question
is
it
useful
to
strive
toward
a
nonexistent
objective
ethics
id
guess
that
it
might
be
in
what
way
it
may
be
the
case
that
some
people
are
unable
to
evaluate
complex
moral
issues
rather
than
leaving
them
to
behave
immorally
it
might
be
better
to
offer
them
an
abstract
nonexistent
objective
system
of
ethics
which
they
can
strive
towards
coded
into
rules
which
they
dont
have
to
derive
for
themselves
i
tend
to
feel
that
this
is
pretty
much
what
we
all
have
as
morality
anyway
