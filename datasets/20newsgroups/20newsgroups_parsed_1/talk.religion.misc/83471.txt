objective
morality
is
morality
built
from
objective
values
you
now
pushed
down
the
defintion
of
objectivity
into
realm
of
objective
values
so
you
need
to
explain
that
as
well
as
well
as
the
objective
subparts
the
objective
atoms
quarks
firstly
science
has
its
basis
in
values
not
the
other
way
round
you
keep
saying
that
i
do
not
think
it
means
what
you
think
it
means
perhaps
you
should
explain
what
you
think
science
has
its
basis
in
values
means
the
reason
why
people
do
science
is
that
they
value
its
results
that
does
not
mean
that
science
has
its
basis
in
values
any
more
than
des
stops
working
if
i
stop
valuing
my
privacy
so
you
better
explain
what
objective
atoms
are
and
how
we
get
them
from
subjective
values
before
we
go
any
further
see
above
