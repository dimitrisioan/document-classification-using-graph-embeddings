hmm
the
police
strategy
of
bursting
in
with
weapons
drawn
clearly
marked
as
officers
and
yelling
police
repeatedly
this
is
used
every
day
to
bust
drug
houses
the
idea
is
to
awe
the
suspects
into
submission
with
surprise
and
display
of
firepowere
in
order
to
avoid
a
gun
fight
as
for
not
knocking
its
a
sad
necessity
in
many
cases
since
the
suspects
will
attempt
to
escape
or
even
fight
usually
this
strategy
works
if
it
didnt
then
it
wouldnt
be
used
so
commonly
now
would
it
how
often
is
it
used
when
the
convoy
carrying
the
brigade
is
visible
for
miles
before
it
reaches
the
place
thats
to
be
searched

hey
i
understand
vaxen
and
vms
thats
what
i
get
paid
for
my
understanding
of
astronomy
is
purely
at
the
amateur
level
or
below
so
unless
what
im
saying
is
directly
related
to
vaxvms
dont
hold
me
or
my
organization
responsible
for
it
if
it
is
related
to
vaxvms
you
can
try
to
hold
me
responsible
for
it
but
my
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
