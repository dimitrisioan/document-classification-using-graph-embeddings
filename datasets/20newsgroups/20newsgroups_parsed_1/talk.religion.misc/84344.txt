writes
question
for
those
of
you
who
seem
to
be
fundamentalists
stephen
tice
the
cotera
joe
gaut
et
alapologies
if
ive
mislabelled
any
of
you
ive
only
started
reading
trm
since
the
bd
disaster
but
i
know
the
cotera
is
a
fundy
and
are
defending
koresh
and
his
beliefs
as
an
example
of
true
christianity
under
persecution
from
the
the
big
bad
secular
state
what
is
your
opinion
of
his
reported
sexual
habits
if
the
reports
are
accurate
what
iyo
does
this
say
about
the
quality
of
his
christianity
or
are
the
allegations
just
part
of
the
big
coverup
thank
you
steve
it
is
refreshing
to
have
someone
accuse
me
of
being
a
christian
i
only
hope
enough
evidence
can
be
garnered
to
get
a
conviction
i
am
not
certain
what
you
mean
by
the
fundy
part
as
the
term
fundamentalist
has
a
wide
variety
of
uses
if
you
refer
to
i
use
it
to
refer
to
those
christians
who
take
a
more
conservativeliteralist
approach
to
the
bible
as
distinct
from
liberals
those
who
actually
believe
jesus
is
the
messiah
and
son
of
god
and
wish
to
follow
in
his
way
then
i
plead
guilty
but
what
does
it
i
would
use
the
word
christian
unqualified
to
describe
someone
to
whom
the
above
definition
applied
btw
it
applies
to
me
deletia
joe
gaut
indicates
his
interest
in
the
bd
disaster
is
from
a
civil
liberties
issue
not
an
attempt
to
justify
koreshs
beliefs
andor
practices
i
agree
with
joe
about
this
if
some
group
wants
to
believe
in
whatever
god
or
invisible
pink
unicorns
and
go
off
and
live
together
and
have
group
sex
or
no
sex
or
sex
only
for
the
leaders
but
not
with
children
then
as
much
as
i
might
believe
them
to
be
misguided
i
think
they
should
have
the
legal
right
and
i
hope
the
investigation
will
start
by
determining
whether
the
feds
had
any
legitimate
reason
for
going
after
koresh
in
the
first
place
before
moving
on
to
consider
the
wisdom
of
various
tactics
used
joe
goes
on
to
dispute
the
childabuse
allegations
ill
provisionally
accept
this
unless
someone
has
evidence
to
support
the
allegations
actually
i
wasnt
thinking
about
the
alleged
child
abuse
but
about
the
reports
that
he
had
sex
with
and
fathered
children
by
several
women
in
the
cult
i
agree
this
is
not
a
legal
matter
consenting
adults
and
all
that
but
stephen
tice
seems
to
be
defending
koreshs
beliefs
and
practices
from
specifically
christian
perspective
not
a
civil
liberties
perspective
i
think
my
question
is
not
really
aimed
at
joe
and
possibly
not
at
ray
cote
either
who
seems
to
also
be
taking
the
political
angle
but
at
stephen
tice
