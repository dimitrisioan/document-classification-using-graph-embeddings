i
think
we
do
agree
given
your
clarification
of
how
we
were
each
using
the
terms
fact
and
theory
ill
only
add
that
i
think
perhaps
i
feel
more
strongly
about
separating
them
though
your
usage
is
quite
valid
note
that
the
fact
of
evolution
is
still
a
theory
in
other
words
it
could
theoretically
still
be
falsified
and
rejected
but
since
its
so
predictive
and
so
consistently
supported
by
evidence
it
seems
pointless
to
explicitly
try
to
falsify
it
anymore
ill
add
here
that
any
falsification
or
rejection
does
not
in
any
way
reduce
its
current
usefulness
so
long
as
it
accurately
predicts
or
describes
things
we
can
observe
not
to
be
a
pain
in
the
ass
but
is
there
any
reason
you
dont
just
say
the
theory
of
evolution
rather
than
the
fact
of
evolution
is
still
a
theory
im
asking
because
this
whole
thread
got
started
because
i
was
bothered
by
a
post
that
referred
to
the
fact
of
evolution
basically
leaving
off
the
phrase
is
still
a
theory
without
a
clarification
like
the
one
you
just
gave
just
saying
the
fact
of
evolution
has
a
very
different
meaning
to
me
description
of
atomic
theory
and
alternative
theories
of
gravity
deleted
both
are
very
useful
models
that
have
no
religious
overtones
or
requirements
of
faith
unless
of
course
you
want
to
demand
that
it
is
a
factual
physical
entity
described
exactly
the
way
the
theory
now
formulated
talks
about
it
here
is
where
you
fail
to
make
an
important
distinction
you
have
shoehorned
the
facts
of
the
existence
of
gravity
and
atoms
and
evolution
into
one
category
with
the
theories
which
have
been
proposed
to
explain
the
mechanisms
the
existence
of
these
things
is
so
predictive
as
to
be
considered
fact
the
mechanisms
on
the
other
hand
are
still
worth
discussing
im
not
sure
i
agree
here
again
it
may
be
because
i
feel
stronger
about
separating
terms
i
was
trying
to
say
that
the
theories
proposed
to
explain
the
mechanisms
and
the
mechanisms
themselves
are
the
only
realities
here
it
is
the
existence
of
mechanisms
not
the
things
themselves
that
are
so
predictive
as
to
be
considered
fact
as
you
would
say
there
arent
really
little
planetary
particle
systems
called
atoms
out
there
or
i
should
say
and
more
to
my
original
point
it
would
be
a
leap
of
faith
to
say
there
are
because
we
observe
only
the
mechanisms
there
is
no
need
to
believe
there
are
actually
atoms
out
there
as
we
have
decided
to
think
about
them
its
enough
to
discuss
the
mechanisms
at
any
rate
im
not
sure
i
am
being
any
clearer
than
before
but
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
shot
the
bottom
line
though
is
i
think
we
agree
on
two
fundamental
ideas
evolution
is
a
theory
supported
by
observational
evidence
my
way
the
fact
of
evolution
is
a
theory
supported
by
observational
evidence
your
way
creation
is
just
an
opinion
if
a
theist
wants
to
call
it
a
theory
then
he
can
i
wont
it
has
no
supporting
evidence
and
it
neither
predicts
nor
supports
any
observations
that
can
be
made
with
no
mechanisms
to
talk
about
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
do
you
agree
