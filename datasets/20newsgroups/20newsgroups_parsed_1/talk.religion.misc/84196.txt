im
going
to
try
to
do
something
here
that
perhaps
many
would
not
have
thought
even
possible
i
want
to
begin
the
process
of
initiating
a
literary
critical
study
of
the
pornography
posted
on
altsexstories
to
identify
the
major
themes
and
motifs
present
in
the
stories
posted
there
opening
up
then
the
possibility
of
an
objective
moral
evaluation
of
the
material
present
there
dennis
im
astounded
i
didnt
know
you
were
interested
to
even
study
such
filth
as
altsexstories
provide
cheers

brethern
whatever
is
true
whatever
is
honorable
whatever
is
right
whatever
is
pure
whatever
is

whatever
is
of
good

if
there
is
any
excellence
and
if
anything
worthy
of
praise
let
your
mind
dwell
on
these
things
