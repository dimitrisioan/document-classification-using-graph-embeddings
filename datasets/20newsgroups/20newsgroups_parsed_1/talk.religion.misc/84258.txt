lets
say
that
we
drop
a
marble
into
the
black
hole
it
races
ever
faster
towards
the
even
horizon
but
thanks
to
the
curving
of
space
caused
by
the
excessive
gravity
as
the
object
approaches
the
event
horizon
it
has
further
to
travel
integrating
the
curve
gives
a
time
to
reach
the
event
horizon
of
infinity
so
the
math
says
that
nothing
can
enter
a
black
hole
isnt
that
just
a
variation
of
the
achilles
the
turtle
paradox
which
states
that
achilles
could
never
possibly
overtake
a
turtle
how
should
one
deal
with
a
man
who
is
convinced
that
he
is
acting
according
to
gods
will
and
who
there
jokke
fore
believes
that
he
is
doing
you
a
favour
by
stabbing
you
in
the
back
