either

i
have
evidence
to
support
the
theory
that
the

burned
themselves
you
made
a
serious
implication
that
the
fbi
was
responsible
for
the
fire
and
the
destruction
of
the
people
all
you
have
done
is
put
doubt
on
who
started
the
fire
without
providing
any
evidence
to
back
up
your
claim
that
the
fbi
was
responsible
last
night
cnn
reported
that
fbi
has
infrared
pictures
showing
that
the
fires
started
in
three
places
at
the
same
time
that
would
indicate
something
not
resembling
an
accident
