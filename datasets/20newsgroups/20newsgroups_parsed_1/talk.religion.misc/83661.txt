what
bothers
me
most
is
why
people
who
have
no
religious
affiliation
continue
to
persecute
jews
why
this
hatred
of
jews
the
majority
of
people
who
persecute
jews
are
not
christians
i
cant
speak
for
all
christians
and
there
are
bound
to
be
a
few
who
are
on
the
antisemitism
bandwagon
do
you
even
have
anecdotal
evidence
to
back
this
up
the
most
blatent
persecution
of
the
jews
in
history
was
of
course
done
by
the
nazis
before
and
during
world
war
ii
a
predominately
lutheran
crowd
sure
many
muslims
in
the
middle
east
consider
the
israelites
to
be
a
thorn
in
their
side
but
the
most
of
the
modern
persecution
of
jews
has
been
at
the
hands
of
christians
at
least
as
far
as
im
aware
rob
lanphier
do
you
consider
neonazis
and
white
supremists
to
be
christian
id
hardly
classify
them
as
christian
do
they
follow
the
teachings
of
christ
love
one
another
love
your
neighbour
as
yourself
love
your
enemies
is
jesus
christ
their
lord
and
saviour
by
the
persecution
of
jews
they
are
violating
all
the
precepts
of
what
christ
died
for
they
are
in
direct
violation
of
the
teachings
of
christ
even
jesus
who
was
crucified
by
the
jewish
leaders
of
that
time
loved
his
enemies
by
asking
the
father
for
forgiveness
of
their
sins
i
am
a
christian
and
i
bear
no
animosity
towards
jews
or
any
one
else
the
enemy
is
satan
not
our
fellow
man
god
be
with
you
