no
a
noknock
warrant
is
in
clear
violation
of
the
th
amendment
okay
what
about
the
fact
that
they
were
tipped
off
they
shouldnt
have
opened
fire
right
wrong
think
about
this
i
am
a
drug
dealer
and
my
competition
wants
to
do
away
with
me
they
call
me
and
tell
me
that
the
feds
are
on
their
way
with
a
noknock
warrant
so
being
moronic
sheep
we
wait
with
our
guns
holstered
now
instead
of
the
feds
in
comes
my
competition
and
were
history
the
only
acceptable
answer
to
a
noknock
warrant
is
blazing
guns
i
may
sound
paranoid
but
our
government
is
out
of
control
and
killing
a
few
federal
officers
make
knock
some
sense
back
into
it
hmm
the
police
strategy
of
bursting
in
with
weapons
drawn
clearly
marked
as
officers
and
yelling
police
repeatedly
this
is
used
every
day
to
bust
drug
houses
the
idea
is
to
awe
the
suspects
into
submission
with
surprise
and
display
of
firepowere
in
order
to
avoid
a
gun
fight
as
for
not
knocking
its
a
sad
necessity
in
many
cases
since
the
suspects
will
attempt
to
escape
or
even
fight
usually
this
strategy
works
if
it
didnt
then
it
wouldnt
be
used
so
commonly
now
would
it
whether
or
not
it
was
appropriate
to
use
this
strategy
on
the
bd
is
not
my
point
since
i
dont
think
any
of
us
have
enough
information
to
make
a
clear
judgement
on
this
issue
i
merely
point
out
that
it
is
a
valid
strategy
which
is
used
every
day
furthermore
we
dont
know
of
any
substitute
strategy
capable
of
apprehending
potentially
dangerous
and
armed
suspects
do
you
suggest
that
the
police
always
knock
with
guns
holstered
and
never
arrest
any
suspects
until
they
have
been
allowed
to
inspect
the
officerss
badges
just
what
should
the
police
do
when
apprehending
potentially
dangerous
and
armed
suspects
how
far
can
they
reasonably
go
to
identiy
themselves
what
do
you
suggest
they
can
do
which
cant
be
faked
by
the
competition
even
if
youve
got
deadly
enemies
who
may
pretend
to
be
cops
thats
not
an
excuse
to
murder
police
in
the
case
of
the
bds
there
was
almost
definitely
at
most
the
paranoid
delusion
of
deadly
enimies
who
would
pretend
to
be
cops
