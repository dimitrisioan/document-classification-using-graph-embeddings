if
you
can
explain
to
me
why
the
death
of
jesus
was
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warned
however
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
arguments
before
and
they
just
dont
convince
me
ask
jesus
himself
he
himself
said
why
in
john
it
isnt
a
mystery
to
anyone
and
there
certainly
is
no
need
for
a
persuasive
argument
read
jesuss
own
reply
to
your
question
john
most
assuredly
i
say
to
you
unless
a
grain
of
wheat
falls
onto
the
ground
and
dies
it
remains
alone
but
if
it
dies
it
produces
much
grain
he
who
loves
his
life
will
lose
it
and
he
who
hates
his
life
in
this
world
will
keep
it
for
eternal
life
if
anyone
serves
me
let
him
follow
me
and
where
i
am
there
my
servant
will
be
also
if
anyone
serves
me
him
my
father
will
honor
why
would
i
want
an
eternal
life
if
i
hate
this
one
if
we
were
created
by
a
deity
why
would
that
deity
not
wish
us
to
enjoy
what
he
has
given
us
why
would
i
want
to
live
forever
the
challenge
in
my
life
is
that
i
will
die
and
that
i
must
give
my
life
the
meaning
i
wish
it
to
have
before
that
happens
my
time
is
here
and
will
someday
pass
i
will
be
content
to
live
on
in
the
memories
of
my
friends
and
once
they
too
are
dead
then
i
will
no
longer
have
any
reason
to
exist
in
short
even
if
your
deity
does
exist
that
doesnt
automatically
mean
that
i
would
worship
it
i
am
content
to
live
my
own
life
and
fend
for
myself
so
when
i
die
i
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
where
i
end
up
it
will
be
because
of
my
actions
and
my
choices
if
your
god
decides
to
toss
me
into
a
flaming
pit
for
this
then
so
be
it
i
would
much
rather
just
cease
to
exist
but
if
your
god
wants
my
respect
and
my
obedience
then
it
had
better
earn
these
and
if
it
does
then
they
will
be
very
strong
and
true
jesus
gives
more
reasons
in
john
but
one
obvious
reason
why
jesus
died
and
as
with
everything
else
it
has
nothing
do
with
his
punishment
was
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubting
and
believe
john
the
fact
that
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obvious
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
this
obvious
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vanity
jesus
wasnt
the
only
one
who
rose
from
the
dead
i
think
it
was
osiris
who
did
the
same
as
well
as
a
few
characters
from
greek
or
norse
legend
if
memory
serves
but
still
why
would
i
want
to
rise
from
the
dead
why
do
you
want
to
why
did
jesus
suffer
in
his
death
again
ask
jesus
jesus
says
why
in
john
thats
no
mystery
either
the
world
hates
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclamation
of
how
far
we
humans
botch
things
up
and
thus
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
if
your
god
wants
to
win
my
devotion
then
it
knows
what
it
can
do
provide
some
way
for
me
to
believe
without
having
to
resort
to
blind
faith
that
could
be
applied
equally
well
to
any
religion
and
why
cant
you
brian
k
accept
this
how
can
you
the
world
can
not
accept
him
because
it
neither
sees
him
nor
knows
him
john
thats
precisely
it
i
neither
see
nor
know
zeus
either
nor
odin
shall
i
offer
them
the
same
devotion
i
offer
jesus
the
animosity
and
the
lack
of
knowledge
that
comes
out
in
your
twistings
of
roberts
daily
verses
is
very
convincing
testimony
of
the
truth
of
john
and
youve
got
to
understand
my
pointofview
i
see
christians
spouting
bible
verse
all
the
time
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
magic
spell
that
will
level
all
opposition
truth
is
its
not
robert
has
never
demonstrated
that
he
actually
understands
what
the
verses
imply
he
just
rattles
them
off
day
by
day
some
brazenly
fly
in
the
face
of
common
sense
and
reality
and
i
point
these
out
where
i
can
but
even
more
than
that
even
when
christians
do
try
to
explain
the
verses
in
their
own
words
they
do
so
from
a
christian
point
of
view
which
is
that
every
human
being
would
want
to
be
a
christian
if
only
he
or
she
understood
the
christian
message
properly
and
then
all
strife
and
suffering
on
the
earth
would
end
heres
the
problem
with
that
substitute
moslem
or
buddhist
or
satanist
instead
of
christian
and
it
means
the
same
thing
christanity
is
a
very
nice
belief
set
around
a
very
nice
book
but
if
you
want
to
make
me
believe
that
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
real
world
youve
got
some
convincing
to
do
i
pray
and
hope
that
i
do
blurt
out
such
animosity
and
lack
of
knowledge
i
am
not
perfect
either
but
regardless
of
that
i
thank
god
that
jesus
revealed
himself
to
me
without
whom
id
also
be
bumbling
about
blindly
though
arrogantly
slandering
the
very
person
who
created
me
and
who
loves
me
and
in
my
opinion
youre
bumbling
about
blindly
making
up
entities
where
there
arent
any
and
depriving
yourself
of
a
true
understanding
and
enjoyment
of
your
life
as
long
as
you
keep
your
beliefs
to
yourself
ill
keep
my
beliefs
to
myself
but
as
soon
as
you
start
waving
them
around
expect
me
to
toss
in
my
opinions
too
