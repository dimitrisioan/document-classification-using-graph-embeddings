take
light
as
another
example
there
are
two
theories
particle
and
wave
each
one
fails
to
predict
the
behavior
of
light
as
some
point
so
which
is
it
particle
or
wave

your
information
on
this
topic
is
very
much
out
of
date
quantum
electro
dynamics
qed
which
considers
light
to
be
particles
has
been
experimentally
verified
to
about
decimal
digits
of
precision
under
all
tested
conditions
im
afraid
that
this
case
at
least
in
the
physics
community
has
been
decided
laymen
should
consult
qed
the
strange
theory
of
light
and
matter
by
richard
p
feynman
and
for
the
more
technically
minded
theres
the
feynman
lectures
on
physics
by
feynman
leighton
and
sands
an
excellent
