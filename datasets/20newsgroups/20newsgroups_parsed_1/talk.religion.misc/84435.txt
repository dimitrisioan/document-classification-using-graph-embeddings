all
i
knew
is
i
really
liked
dropping
cid
lsd
frankly
speaking
i
didnt
really
care
it
was
fun
anyway
it
didnt
matter
that
every
child
my
wife
and
i
want
to
have
are
at
a
tremendously
greater
risk
of
serious
birth
defects
for
several
years
all
i
knew
is
i
really
liked
having
sex
with
as
many
women
as
i
could
convice
frankly
speaking
i
didnt
care
i
didnt
care
that
i
was
putting
each
one
of
them
at
risk
as
well
as
their
future
partners
it
seems
you
lived
a
fairly
wild
life
my
background
is
far
more
traditional
mostly
working
working
working
maybe
theres
a
clear
indication
that
the
way
you
lived
your
life
produced
a
certain
amount
of
anxiety
that
needed
to
be
released
religion
was
one
possible
medicine
while
my
more
stable
environment
didnt
and
still
does
not
produce
the
situation
where
i
feel
such
guilt
this
is
just
one
possible
explanation
why
you
feel
this
burden
while
i
havent
felt
it
so
far
