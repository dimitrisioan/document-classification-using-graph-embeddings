anyone
who
missed
it
should
see
the
original
lists
like
this
that
just
toss
a
bunch
of
quotes
together
to
make
a
bible
verse
salad
just
dont
cut
it
those
of
us
who
want
to
argue
against
inerrancy
should
find
this
sort
of
thing
as
embarassing
as
the
fundies
should
find
josh
mcdowell
true
except
that
ive
known
few
fundies
who
had
enough
sense
to
be
embarrassed
by
josh
mcdowell
okay
maybe
a
cheap
shot
but
im
in
that
kind
of
mood
