some
people
even
raised
protests
when
we
had
a
moment
of
silence
for
a
class
member
who
had
tragically
died
saying
this
implied
endorsing
religion
because
of
course
that
possibility
existed
meaning
any
student
who
really
gave
a
shit
could
have
a
moment
of
silence
on
hisher
own
which
makes
more
sense
than
forcing
those
who
dont
want
to
participate
to
have
to
take
part
what
other
reason
is
there
for
an
organized
moment
of
silence
a
moment
of
silence
doesnt
mean
much
unless
everyone
participates
otherwise
its
not
silent
now
is
it
nonreligious
reasons
for
having
a
moment
of
silence
for
a
dead
classmate
to
comfort
the
friends
by
showing
respect
to
the
deceased
to
give
the
classmates
a
moment
to
grieve
together
to
give
the
friends
a
moment
to
remember
their
classmate
in
the
context
of
the
school
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
the
classmate
is
gone
so
that
its
not
disruptive
later
blindly
opposing
everything
with
a
flavor
of
religion
in
it
is
utterly
