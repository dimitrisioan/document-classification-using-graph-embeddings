since
you
have
referred

i

you
are
referring

please

firstcentury
greek
is
wellknown
and
wellunderstood
have
you
considered
josephus
the
jewish
historian
who
also
wrote
of
jesus
in
addition
the
four
gospel
accounts
are
very
much
in
harmony
bill
i
find
it
rather
remarkable
that
you
managed
to
zero
in
on
what
is
probably
the
weakest
evidence
what
is
probably
the
most
convincing
is
the
antichristian
literature
put
out
by
the
jewish
councils
in
the
second
century
there
are
enormous
quantities
of
detailed
arguments
against
christianity
many
of
the
arguments
still
being
used
today
despite
volumes
of
tracts
attacking
christianity
not
one
denies
the
existance
of
jesus
only
of
his
activities
i
find
this
considerably
more
compelling
than
josephus
or
the
harmony
of
the
gospels
especially
considering
that
matthew
and
luke
probably
used
mark
as
a
source
