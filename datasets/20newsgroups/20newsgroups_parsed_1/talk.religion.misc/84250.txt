you
said
everyone
in
the
world
that
means
everyone
in
the
world
including
children
that
are
not
old
enough
to
speak
let
alone
tell
lies
if
jesus
says
everyone
you
can
not
support
that
by
referring
to
a
group
of
people
somewhat
smaller
than
everyone
thats
right
everyone
even
infants
who
can
not
speak
as
yet
even
a
little
child
will
rebelliously
stick
his
finger
in
a
light
socket
even
a
little
child
will
not
want
his
diaper
changed
even
a
little
child
will
fight
naptime
oh
boy
get
a
small
baby
and
figure
out
how
much
brain
power
they
have
the
first
months
