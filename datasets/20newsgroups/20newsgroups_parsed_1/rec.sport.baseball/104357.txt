does
any
one
out
there
listen
to
wfan
for
those
of
you
who
do
not
know
what
i
am
talking
about
it
is
an
all
sports
radio
staion
in
new
york
on
a
clear
night
the
signal
reaches
up
and
down
the
east
coast
in
particular
i
want
to
know
how
len
berman
and
mike
lupicas
show
is
i
go
to
school
in
virginia
so
i
cant
listen
when
there
are
on
during
the
day
just
wondering
the
fan
is
an
okay
sports
radio
station
but
doesnt
come
close
to
the
ultimate
in
sports
radio
wip
in
philadelphia
the
signal
might
not
be
as
powerful
but
then
again
only
stations
in
new
york
feel
obligated
to
pollute
everyone
elses
airwaves
with
a
bunch
of
hoodlum
mets
fans
complaining
hours
a
day
wip
took
two
of
your
best
sports
jockeys
too
jody
macdonald
and
steve
fredericks
wip
is
rockin
with
sports
talk
from
am
till
midnight
check
it
out
anytime
your
within
a
few
hours
of
philadelphia
if
im
not
mistaken
wip
has
the
highest
sports
talk
ratings
in
the
nation
rob
ps
the
only
nice
thing
about
the
fan
is
that
they
talk
sports
all
night
hopefully
will
begin
to
do
that
somewhat
soon
