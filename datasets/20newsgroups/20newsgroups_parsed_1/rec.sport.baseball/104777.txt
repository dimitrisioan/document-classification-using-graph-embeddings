does
anyone
else
think
that
this
weekends
fourgame
series
was
a
really
strange
one
yup
i
was
wondering
the
whole
time
why
the
braves
most
talented
outfielder
neon
deon
was
not
starting
heres
whoa
arent
you
forgetting
a
couple
of
guys
named
gant
and
justice
a
guy
who
can
hit
hrs
leadoff
and
steal
he
can
lead
off
hell
probably
steal
he
might
hit
hell
never
hit
homers
i
think
you
went
for
on
this
one
bases
and
they
start
guys
like
nixon
and
bream
ahead
of
him
i
cant
really
see
that
advantage
of
nixon
over
deon
except
that
nixon
is
a
better
defensive
outfielder
you
said
it
all
right
there
does
anyone
else
out
there
not
like
deon
i
think
hes
all
hype
his
season
last
year
was
good
but
im
not
convinced
that
he
can
do
it
again
it
reminds
me
sorry
of
the
year
when
tim
wallach
hit
or
so
homers
and
had
rbi
it
never
even
came
close
to
happening
again
of
course
maybe
i
just
prefer
guys
who
go
about
their
business
and
dont
play
it
up
for
the
attention
just
my
ho
doug
roberts
larry
walker
is
god
delino
deshields
thinks
he
is
john
bratt

youre
