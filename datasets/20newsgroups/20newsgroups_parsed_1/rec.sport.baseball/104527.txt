does
any
one
out
there
listen
to
wfan
for
those
of
you
who
do
not
know
what
i
am
talking
about
it
is
an
all
sports
radio
staion
in
new
york
on
a
clear
night
the
signal
reaches
up
and
down
the
east
coast
in
particular
i
want
to
know
how
len
berman
and
mike
lupicas
show
is
i
go
to
school
in
virginia
so
i
cant
listen
when
there
are
on
during
the
day
just
wondering
youre
right
about
the
signal
being
strong
i
live
in
west
philadelphia
and
i
can
get
fan
almost
perfectly
its
a
sports
fans
dream
especially
if
that
person
is
from
ny
and
wants
to
hear
about
his
teams
while
hes
away
at
school
as
for
lupica
berman
its
turned
out
to
be
lupica
then
berman
neither
of
them
wanted
to
work
a
full
four
hour
show
so
ed
coleman
and
dave
sims
old
fourhour
slot
was
broken
down
into
two
seperate
twohour
show
lupica
from
and
berman
from
and
they
both
happen
to
suck
in
comparison
to
eddie
and
dave
come
back
guys
the
fan
is
an
okay
sports
radio
station
but
doesnt
come
close
to
the
ultimate
in
sports
radio
wip
in
philadelphia
the
signal
might
not
be
as
powerful
but
then
again
only
stations
in
new
york
feel
obligated
to
pollute
everyone
elses
airwaves
with
a
bunch
of
hoodlum
mets
fans
complaining
hours
a
day
wip
took
two
of
your
best
sports
jockeys
too
jody
macdonald
and
steve
fredericks
wip
is
rockin
with
sports
talk
from
am
till
midnight
check
it
out
anytime
your
within
a
few
hours
of
philadelphia
if
im
not
mistaken
wip
has
the
highest
sports
talk
ratings
in
the
nation
like
i
said
i
live
in
philly
so
i
can
hear
fan
andor
wip
whenever
i
want
but
i
can
not
stand
wip
and
it
isnt
because
i
loathe
the
philly
sports
teams
the
phillies
are
my
favorite
nl
team
yanks
are
favorite
al
and
the
eagles
arent
too
bad
either
there
are
two
big
problems
total
emphasis
on
the
home
teams
especially
the
eagles
unlike
the
fan
hosts
who
can
at
least
answer
a
question
about
an
outoftown
team
if
a
caller
asks
the
wip
hosts
seem
to
have
no
clue
about
any
team
that
doesnt
play
on
broad
street
also
fans
periodic
sports
updates
every
minutes
gives
sports
news
and
scores
from
around
the
country
its
very
rare
to
hear
an
outoftown
score
being
reported
on
wip
the
hosts
with
the
exception
of
jody
macdonald
who
i
miss
from
his
days
at
fan
none
of
the
hosts
really
seems
to
have
both
a
broad
knowledge
of
the
sport
or
a
good
onair
presence
the
worst
is
gary
cobb
who
seems
to
have
been
hired
solely
on
the
basis
that
he
used
to
play
for
the
eagles
anyway
thats
my
two
cents
on
the
whole
fan
vs
wip
battle
alan
