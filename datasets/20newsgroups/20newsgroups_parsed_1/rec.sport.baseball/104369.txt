after
reading
my
local
paper
today
i
found
out
that
the
phillies
started
the
season
at
i
am
not
as
old
as
but
ive
heard
many
talk
about
the
serious
choke
job
the
phillies
did
that
season
they
were
ahead
of
the
cardinals
by
games
that
season
in
midaugust
they
managed
to
lose
a
bunch
from
then
on
and
the
cardinals
took
the
division
games
ahead
and
lost
it
i
hope
this
season
is
much
different
strictly
from
memory
i
think
the
phillies
were
something
like
ten
games
up
with
to
go
lost
in
a
row
and
of
last
to
lose
to
the
cardinals
seems
impossible
but
thats
how
i
remember
it
i
also
felt
at
the
time
that
johnny
callison
of
the
phillies
lost
the
mvp
as
a
byproduct
of
their
swoon
jerry
ps
in
a
single
team
out
of
won
the
pennant
no
divisions
