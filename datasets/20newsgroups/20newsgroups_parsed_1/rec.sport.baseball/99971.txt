pure
fantasy
baseball
teams
unfortunely
we
are
running
the
league
using
earl
weaver
baseball
ii
with
the
comm
disk
ii
and
we
need
the
stats
for
the
season
preferably
the
major
league
stat
disk
we
have
the
total
stats
but
ewb
needs
the
split
stats
otherwise
we
have
inning
games
because
the
comm
disk
turns
total
stats
into
vs
ls
stats
unless
you
know

right
and
left
handed
stats
so
if
anyone
