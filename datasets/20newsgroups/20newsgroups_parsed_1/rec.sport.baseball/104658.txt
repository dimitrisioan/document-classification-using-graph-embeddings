its
certainly
not
very
easy
what
i
do
is
use
frame
advance
on
the
tape
and
simply
count
the
frames
five
times
and
try
to
throw
out
any
outliers
its
not
perfect
but
its
better
than
a
blow
to
the
head
with
a
large
metal
object
ah
so
you
finally
found
a
use
for
that
super
slomo
and
frame
advance
other
than
scrutinizing
sorority
babes
in
heat
congrats
i
wish
i
had
films
instead
of
tapes
preferably
at
fps
rather
than
but
while
im
at
it
id
like
to
have
ten
million
dollars
and
be
able
to
eat
anything
i
want
and
never
gain
any
weight
either
trust
me
youd
have
a
helluva
time
manipulating
them
besides
if
you
converted
the
film
to
video
youd
have
all
kinds
of
artifacts
because
of
the
difference
in
frame
rate
unless
youre
an
expert
at
doing
pulldown
for
a
laserdisc
company
or
something
garys
list
of
the
ten
slowest
bats
in
baseball
hey
no
fair
what
about
fettucine
alfredo
griffin
the
guy
practically
has
to
pivot
the
bat
around
along
with
his
body
garys
list
of
how
the
hell
can
he
hit
like
that
julio
franco
phil
plantier
darren
daulton
daulton
doesnt
strike
me
as
all
that
strange
hes
a
little
bit
quiet
at
the
plate
but
like
franco
gets
the
bat
through
the
hitting
zone
on
a
level
plane
the
first
time
i
watched
julio
franco
i
didnt
think
anyone
could
hit
like
that
now
i
marvel
at
how
easy
he
makes
it
look
every
time
he
makes
contact
its
solid
hes
got
good
power
to
all
fields
and
rarely
is
he
caught
not
ready
for
a
pitch
i
wonder
if
phil
plantier
had
a
severe
bout
with
hemorrhoids
and
had
to
practice
his
swing
while
on
the
throne
sure
looks
like
it
how
bout
one
to
add
to
your
list
travis
fryman
the
guy
plants
his
front
foot
and
seems
to
swing
across
his
body
he
generates
a
lot
of
power
but
i
keep
thinking
he
could
generate
even
more
if
he
could
get
a
better
pivot
out
of
his
hips
garys
list
of
id
give
dave
kirschs
kidneys
to
have
a
swing
like
that
well
theyre
already
spoken
for
by
several
people
but
id
add
robbie
alomars
name
to
the
list
among
others
i
really
like
dean
palmers
swing
for
some
twisted
reason
as
well
as
pedro
munozs
swing
thats
all
for
now
im
looking
at
derrick
mays
tapes
tonight
along
with
troy
neels
that
guy
is
a
serious
ox
a
thought
about
may
it
looks
like
theyve
taught
him
to
turn
on
the
ball
imho
hes
going
to
fall
in
love
with
his
newfound
power
and
start
pulling
off
the
ball
to
the
point
that
hes
going
to
see
lots
of
sinkerssliders
low
and
away
unless
he
adjusts
quickly
and
starts
rifling
doubles
to
left
and
leftcenter
imho
youre
going
to
see
a
good
number
of
weak
grounders
to
the
right
side
of
the
infield
in
the
next
month
dave
hung
like
a
jim
acker
slider
kirsch
blue
jays
do
it
again
in
new
quotes
out
of
context
not
to
beat
a
dead
horse
but
its
been
a
couple
o
weeks
this
