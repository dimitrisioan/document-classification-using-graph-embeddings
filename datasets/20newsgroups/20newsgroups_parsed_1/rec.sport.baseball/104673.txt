i
have
wondered
why
a
pitcher
is
given
pitches
when
he
enters
the
game
lets
be
serious
the
relief
pitcher
has
normally
been
throwing
out
in
the
bullpen
for
a
few
minutes
does
he
really
need
more
pitches
if
the
relief
pitcher
didnt
get
pitches
there
wouldnt
be
enough
time
to
play
hit
the
road
jack
the
iron
city
relief
pitcher
commercial
the
announcers
to
detail
to
us
exactly
what
drove
the
previous
one
from
the
game
a
detailed
biography
both
personal
and
statistical
of
the
new
guy
throwing
his
pitches
get
really
cool
superslomo
pictures
for
diamond
