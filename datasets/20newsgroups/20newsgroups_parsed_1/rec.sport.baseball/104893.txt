if
this
is
true
note
that
i
dont
think
it
is
lasorda
should
be
fired
for
at
least
two
reasons
publicly
humiliating
his
players
knuckling
under
to
his
players
wishes
there
is
a
fine
line
between
getting
players
input
and
knuckling
under
to
players
demands
a
manager
much
like
a
military
officer
needs
to
have
his
her
players
complete
obedience
and
respect
during
a
game
after
the
game
its
no
big
deal
but
when
there
is
no
time
to
do
more
than
react
players
must
trust
the
manager
or
the
team
often
falls
apart
see
boston
red
sox
ff
strawberrys
demeanor
as
represented
by
the
media
often
sounds
like
demands
i
suspect
that
a
comment
like
i
enjoy
hitting
fourth
im
used
to
it
would
get
pretty
brutally
misinterpreted
by
the
media
if
it
came
from
strawberry
russ
porter
quoted
strawberry
as
saying
i
feel
more
comfortable
hitting
cleanup
and
i
think
i
perform
best
in
that
role
paraphrased
by
my
memory
and
bias
that
seems
like
a
fairly
nonpetulant
answer
to
what
was
almost
certainly
a
question
like
how
do
you
feel
about
being
moved
to
the
third
spot
in
the
order
a
more
mediasensitive
player
might
answer
the
manager
knows
what
he
is
doing
if
he
thinks
that
batting
me
third
will
help
the
team
then
i
am
all
for
it
wed
ignore
that
answer
as
brown
stuff
so
it
seems
a
little
bit
of
an
overreaction
to
brand
darryls
response
as
petulant
personally
i
think
his
argument
is
nonsense
and
that
it
really
doesnt
matter
much
in
which
order
the
players
in
the
order
are
batted
except
for
personal
stats
if
i
were
darryl
id
probably
answer
that
question
the
number
four
spot
gets
a
few
more
rbi
opportunities
and
i
get
paid
for
rbis
i
think
it
is
best
for
me
to
bat
fourth
but
i
am
willing
to
hit
third
if
tommy
thinks
it
will
benefit
the
team
or
something
like
that
it
would
be
helpful
at
salary
timemy
rbis
were
down
because
i
was
hitting
thirdand
make
him
sound
like
a
team
player
since
strawberry
will
not
likely
go
through
arbitration
but
use
the
free
agent
market
for
his
next
contract
maybe
that
argument
is
useless
but
it
would
help
his
image
with
the
media
without
appearing
to
be
totally
contentfree
remember
the
media
is
of
the
belief
that
ones
best
rbi
man
should
hit
fourth
so
the
argument
is
sensible
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
is
true
