boston
red
sox
win
its
games
of
games
by
beating
seattle
roger
clemson
pitch
not
so
dominate
he
walked
at
least
man
in
first
inns
but
valetin
and
greenwell
hit
homeruns
and
red
sox
prevail
clemens
struggled
with
his
control
but
was
also
the
beneficiary
of
some
pretty
shoddy
umpiring
but
to
be
fair
most
of
the
walks
were
early
in
the
game
and
he
adjusted
he
was
also
helped
by
dare
i
say
it
some
pretty
good
defense
by
the
sox
including
rivera
playing
at
second
not
his
normal
position
actually
clemens
is
pretty
lucky
that
he
got
the
win
considering
the
sox
almost
gave
up
the
lead
in
the
bottom
of
the
th
on
mos
error
catching
a
throwover
i
think
that
game
is
must
win
for
red
sox
in
seattle
considering
darwin
will
faced
seattle
ace
randy
johnson
tonight
must
win
in
april
theyve
already
won
more
games
so
far
than
anyone
thought
they
would
at
this
point
of
the
season
i
hope
people
arent
getting
too
caught
up
in
this
streak
its
been
fun
but
teams
have
streaks
all
the
time
and
it
is
only
when
they
are
at
the
start
of
the
season
that
they
get
so
much
attention
