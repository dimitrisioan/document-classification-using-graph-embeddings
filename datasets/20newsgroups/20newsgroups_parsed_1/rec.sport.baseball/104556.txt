my
point
rbi
might
not
be
a
perfect
stat
but
nothing
is
and
no
stat
or
lack
of
can
tell
me
there
are
no
clutch
hitters
maybe
no
stat
can
tell
me
either
but
some
people
are
i
just
know
it
i
was
hoping
somebody
would
mention
clutch
clutch
baerga
the
two
words
simply
do
not
go
together
with
runners
in
scoring
position
baerga
batted
last
year
this
doesnt
quite
suck
but
most
batters
hit
better
in
this
situation
alomar
he
hit
with
runners
in
scoring
position
the
difference
alomar
had
rbis
in
such
ab
baerga
had
rbis
in
such
ab
baerga
got
more
chances
yet
succeeded
only
more
times
frankly
i
dont
believe
in
clutch
but
if
i
did
my
vote
would
go
to
alomar
for
mvp
let
alone
best
b
in
the
al
valentine
