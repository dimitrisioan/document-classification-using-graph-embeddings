just
had
to
respond
to
the
bosox
boasts
ie
bosox
win
again
see
red
sox
fans
can
never
do
anything
right
in
your
mind
huh
if
we
get
excited
about
the
sox
winning
you
tell
us
it
is
going
to
be
over
soon
if
we
worry
that
itll
be
over
soon
you
say
that
we
are
not
true
fans
i
am
a
sox
fan
and
i
think
after
what
ive
been
through
being
a
sox
fan
that
sox
fans
are
true
fans
i
am
excited
at
what
they
are
doing
so
greenwell
was
horrible
against
johnson
who
cares
the
sox
are
with
all
nondarwin
starts
what
are
the
mariners
i
think
the
sox
have
the
best
record
in
baseball
still
so
they
lost
one
darn
johnson
is
a
quality
pitcher
and
not
the
only
quality
mariner
pitcher
i
logged
on
expecting
to
see
at
least
one
congratulatory
note
for
chris
bosios
no
hitter
but
nary
a
peep
so
ill
take
this
opportunity
to
note
that
the
red
feet
are
now
and
slinking
out
of
town
without
having
scored
a
run
in
the
last
two
games
or
even
a
hit
in
last
nights
gem
not
that
we
ms
fans
can
compare
our
suffering
to
those
of
the
followers
of
new
englands
longrunning
tragedy
but
only
one
winning
season
in
history
is
something
of
a
burden
to
bear
so
well
take
our
joys
when
we
can
get
em
the
mariners
now
have
two
nohit
pitchers
on
the
staff
and
not
coincidentally
those
pitchers
beat
the
red
sox
in
back
to
back
games
