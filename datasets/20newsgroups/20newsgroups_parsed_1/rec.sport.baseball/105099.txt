batter
and
to
my
amazement
the
umpire
missed
it
in
the
years
that
i
played
ball
this
was
worst
piece
of
umpiring
i
ever
saw
now
this
sounds
like
a
fun
topic
in
a
slo
pitch
softball
game
we
had
the
first
base
dugout
one
of
our
players
hit
a
shot
down
the
first
base
line
with
the
bases
loaded
the
only
question
was
fair
or
foul
ball
hits
ground
chalk
flies
umpire
calls
foul
we
give
him
the
standard
didnt
you
see
chalk
line
his
response
was
it
hit
the
foul
half
of
the
line
we
all
started
laughing
mark
pede
not
bad
we
had
a
similar
situation
slowpitch
softball
bases
loaded
weakest
hitter
at
the
plate
he
hits
a
line
drive
over
the
third
basemans
head
that
hooked
and
hooked
and
finally
landed
ten
feet
in
foul
ground
almost
hitting
the
fence
down
that
side
of
the
field
but
the
umpire
called
fair
ball
i
was
coaching
third
yelling
at
evrybody
to
move
up
a
base
the
umps
position
it
was
still
fair
when
it
passed
third
base
why
the
other
team
didnt
immediately
protest
ill
never
know
we
certainly
werent
going
to
argue
about
it
since
every
body
did
manage
to
advance
one
base
safely
there
was
also
the
time
when
a
batted
ball
ricocheted
off
my
runner
from
second
base
leg
fielded
by
the
ss
steps
on
second
to
force
the
runner
from
first
and
throw
to
first
in
time
for
what
the
umpire
called
a
triple
play
protest
removed

we
won
the
game
