actually
have
the
answer
to
this
one
bosio
after
walking
the
first
two
batters
retired
straight
for
a
backend
perfect
game
well
there
were
outs
in
a
row
with
no
hits
or
walks
in
between
but
really
he
only
retired
batters
in
a
row
the
first
out
of
the
game
was
the
front
end
of
a
double
play
still
counts
as
a
backend
perfect
game
in
my
book
though
congrats
to
chris
bosio
