line
says
it
all
what
is
the
rule
that
qualifies
a
pitcher
as
making
a
save
as
far
as
i
know
a
save
opportunity
is
when
it
is
th
inning
or
beyond
and
the
batter
on
deck
can
either
tie
or
win
the
ball
game
for
example
if
it
is
the
bottom
of
the
th
inning
and
clemens
is
pithching
the
red
sox
are
leading
and
clemens
has
just
givin
up
a
hit
so
there
is
a
man
on
first
the
batter
and
the
batter
on
deck
could
tie
the
game
with
a
homer
if
jeff
russel
came
in
the
red
sox
reliever
and
finished
the
game
without
allowing
the
tieing
or
losing
run
to
score
he
would
get
the
save
and
clemens
would
get
the
win
thats
how
i
beleive
it
works
hope
i
could
help
the
cowboy
