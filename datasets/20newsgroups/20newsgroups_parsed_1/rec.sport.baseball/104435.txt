re

americas
team
isbut
why
writes
the
defenition
of
the
underdog
is
a
team
that
has
no
talent
and
comes
out
of
nowhere
to
contend
the
mets
and
orioles
are
prime
examples
not
the
cubs
sorry
but
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
win
a
division
with
no
talent
over
games
i
would
amend
your
definition
to
underdog
a
team
expected
to
lose
but
which
wins
thanks
to
underestimated
talent
