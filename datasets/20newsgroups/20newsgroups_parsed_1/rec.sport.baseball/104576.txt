talking
the
other
day
and
we
were
for
some
reason
trying
to
come
up
with
names
of
jewish
baseball
players
past
and
present
we
werent
able
to
come
up
with
much
except
for
sandy
koufax
somebody
stankowitz
and
maybe
john
lowenstein
can
anyone
come
up
with
any
more
i
know
it
sounds
pretty
lame
to
be
racking
our
brains
over
this
but
humor
us
thanks
for
your
help
thanks
bobby
hank
greenberg
would
have
to
be
the
most
famous
because
his
jewish
faith
actually
affected
his
play
missing
late
season
or
was
it
world
series
games
because
of
yom
kippur
i
thought
that
was
sandy
koufax
