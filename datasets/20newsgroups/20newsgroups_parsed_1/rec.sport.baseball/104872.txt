if

last

your

the

my
team
is
the

leftturns
if
manny
lee
were
on
my
team
i
would
not
be
wearing
a
ring

would
he
if
however
i
were
on
manny
lees
team
again
if
manny
lee
was

your

last

your
team
would
not
have
been
the
albuquerque
leftturns
it
would
have
been
the
toronto
blue
jays
how
is
that
possible
he
was
on
the
albuquerque
leftturns
last
year
how
could
you
possibly
know
what
team
he
would
be
on
if
manny
lee
was
on
his
team
last
year
after
all
manny
lee
wasnt
on
his
team
last
year
so
its
complete
unfounded
speculation
to
state
that
if
he
was
on
the
same
team
as
manny
lee
last
year
it
would
have
been
the
team
of
the
toronto
blue
jays
since
he
and
lee
werent
on
the
same
team
you
can
not
possibly
objectively
state
what
team
they
would
have
been
on
if
they
had
both
been
on
the
same
team
