three
homer
games
and
padres
notes
to
all
those
out
there
wondering
about
who
holds
the
record
for
three
homer
games
ina
career
the
answer
is
johnny
mize
in
his
career
with
the
cards
and
the
yanks
he
hit
three
times
i
am
almost
sure
about
this
in
case
anyone
is
wondering
the
record
for
two
homer
games
is
held
by
babe
ruth
and
is
mizes
record
may
not
last
for
much
longer
because
of
juan
gonzalez
he
has
at
least
three
games
with
three
and
maybe
i
know
that
he
had
at
least
two
last
year
and
one
as
a
rookie
i
dont
have
any
record
books
at
college
for
me
to
check
on
though
please
let
me
know
okay
if
i
am
wrong
onto
the
padres
is
there
anyone
out
there
who
follows
them
especially
those
with
access
to
local
news
i
dont
here
anything
in
los
angeles
and
i
cant
get
mcpaper
consistently
around
here
comment
it
looks
as
though
san
diego
has
gotten
the
better
of
the
two
deals
that
brought
bell
and
plantier
to
the
padres
it
has
also
forced
the
team
to
use
darrell
shermann
of
course
plantier
could
get
injured
again
or
he
could
hit
with
the
power
of
but
with
a
lower
average
bell
always
could
finish
with
and
hrsessentially
jerald
clarks
numbers
leadoff
comment
craig
shipley
i
get
on
base
of
the
time
if
im
lucky
at
leadoff
hell
of
the
usual
starters
use
gwynn
hes
got
steals
already
is
shipley
starting
because
of
an
injury
to
stillwell
though
i
havent
seen
stillwells
name
in
any
box
scores
anyway
unless
you
are
going
to
use
shermann
at
leadoff
then
use
gwynn
he
at
lesat
gets
on
base
and
this
year
is
stealing
bases
sheffield
comment
though
the
season
is
early
and
stats
mean
nothing
witness
phillips
batting
currently
but
does
sheffield
have
an
injury
or
anythingelse
wrong
with
him
i
just
dont
hear
anything
andy
benes
is
he
pitching
like
he
did
in
the
second
half
of
or
is
this
a
flash
of
promise
that
he
throws
out
evrey
now
and
then
has
anyone
seen
him
pitch
the
two
good
games
score
for
today
sunday
