when

turned
away
hirschbeck
immediately
motioned
for
gant
to
step
into
the
box
imo
at
this
point
in
time
hirschbeck
was
determined
to
show
gant
exactly
who
was
in
charge
of
this
game
gant
wasnt
dawdling
he
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
dawdle
and
hirschbeck
was
simply
exercising
a
power
play
gant
resisted
as
many
of
us
might
to
what
we
thought
was
an
unreasonable
request
and
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
at
that
point
cox
came
out
on
the
field
the
pitch
was
thrown
and
many
other
braves
left
the
dugout
cox
was
tossed
protecting
his
player
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
gant
kept
his
cool
enough
to
stay
in
the
game
did
you
see
the
same
game
i
saw
gant
most
reasonable
argued
a
horrible
call
which
hirschbeck
correctly
did
nothing
about
gant
then
proceeded
to
walk
halfway
to
rd
base
lean
on
his
bat
and
glare
at
hirschbeck
while
i
dont
necessasarily
subscribe
to
the
theory
of
showing
people
up
this
was
an
obvious
attempt
by
gant
to
do
so
to
hirschbeck
he
left
hirschbeck
no
choice
but
to
take
control
of
the
situation
the
bottom
line
is
gant
started
a
dangerous
power
struggle
with
hirschbeck
when
his
team
needed
him
most
and
he
lost
the
events
i
saw
were
called

hirschbeck

hirschbeck
not

made
the

fairly
likely
although
i
suspect
an
argument
might
have
gotten
gant
tossed
altogether

if
hirschbeck
had

step
out
the
