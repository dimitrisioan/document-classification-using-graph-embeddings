however
what
is
with
this
policy
of
trying
to
speed
up
the
games
you
are
the
first
person
nonmediot
i
have
seen
endorse
this
policy
i
have
no
problem
with
the
length
of
games
at
all
and
am
tired
of
the
espn
crowd
and
other
announcers
bitching
about
it
i
have
never
been
in
a
ballpark
filled
with
people
looking
at
their
watches
and
shouting
hurry
up
if
i
cough
up
big
bucks
for
a
ticket
i
dont
mind
a
game
that
last
more
than
i
really
dont
understand
it
major
league
baseball
is
trying
to
expand
its
appeal
to
people
with
shorter
attention
spans
ie
the
football
crowd
invariably
all
the
arguments
from
people
who
dont
like
to
watch
baseball
on
tv
say
the
same
thing
the
games
are
too
long
and
too
boring
baseball
is
trying
to
find
a
way
to
shorten
the
games
for
wider
tv
appeal
if
you
look
at
it
though
baseball
games
last
around
the
same
amount
of
time
as
football
games
the
difference
is
that
there
is
more
action
in
that
duration
in
football
games
perhaps
if
there
were
more
action
in
baseball
games
you
would
get
more
of
those
fans
to
tune
in
anyway
coming
up
with
a
solution
to
make
baseball
more
appealing
to
a
bigger
crowd
is
going
to
be
difficult
on
soapbox
yet
another
reason
to
get
a
commisioner
now
since
its
obvious
that
ruling
baseball
by
comittee
works
about
as
fast
as
a
snail
race

nebraska
