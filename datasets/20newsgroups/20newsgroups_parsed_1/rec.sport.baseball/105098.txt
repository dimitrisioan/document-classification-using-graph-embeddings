the
owners
are
whining
about
baseball
not
being
popular
among
a
large
enough
portion
of
the
population
and
have
suggested
various
remedies
such
as
shortening
the
game
or
trying
to
convince
us
that
smokeembakeemdominatebysheerintimidation
is
an
accurate
description
of
what
is
essentially
a
laidback
game
forget
those
lame
ideas
here
is
my
new
and
exciting
twopoint
plan
to
generate
interest
in
baseball
among
the
masses
point
one
sex
point
two
violence
lets
face
it
sex
and
violence
are
the
only
things
that
sell
in
america
heres
how
we
can
implement
them
in
the
game
sex
cheerleaders
cheerleaders
and
more
cheerleaders
dancing
on
top
of
the
dugouts
bringing
hot
dogs
to
the
umps
during
the
seventh
inning
stretch
running
up
and
down
the
stands
the
south
bend
white
sox
actually
do
this
violence
baseball
players
are
such
utter
wuss
boys
the
pitcher
beans
the
batter
and
both
benches
empty
in
what
is
called
a
benchclearing
brawl
everybody
just
stands
there
and
looks
at
each
other
stand
stand
stand
look
look
look
ho
hum
then
the
bullpens
come
running
in
when
they
reach
the
fight
they
just
stand
there
too
anybody
coming
off
the
bench
who
does
not
throw
at
least
one
punch
should
be
suspended
and
fined
further
the
bullpens
should
fight
it
out
in
the
outfield
so
as
not
to
waste
time
and
energy
running
to
the
infield
i
think
what
bob
is
describing
here
is
a
game
which
mad
magazine
called
basebrawl
i
have
no
idea
what
issue
but
it
sure
did
cover
the
violence
issue
