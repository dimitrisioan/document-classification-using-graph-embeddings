i
am
not
quite
sure
of
the
reasons
but
the
old
man
was
certainly
not
enraptured
by
ole
harry
but
maybe
his
wife
was
i
dont
claim
to
know
whether
its
true
or
not
but
a
couple
different
people
totally
unrelated
have
said
harry
was
relieved
of
his
duties
because
he
had
more
than
platonic
relations
with
augie
buschs
wife
judgement
is
left
to
the
individual
cuz
i
sure
dont
claim
to
be
an
impeachable
source
in
this
case
among
those
who
have
said
it
well
not
quite
said
it
but
certainly
alluded
to
it
is
bing
devine
redbird
gm
or
some
other
administrator
at
the
time
i
heard
bing
speak
about
it
at
last
years
sabr
national
btw
have
we
had
a
show
of
hands
about
who
will
be
attending
this
years
sabr
national
in
san
diego

be
there
neal
youre
only
young
once
but
you
can
be
immature
forever
larry
andersen
harry
talks
about
this
incident
in
his
autobiography
holy
cow
unfortunately
i
can
not
clarify
on
this
since
i
read
the
book
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
i
do
not
have
my
book
with
me
anyway
it
is
a
pretty
interesting
book
if
you
are
a
harry
or
cubs
fan
