frank
viola
and
rest
of
pitcher
staff
of
boston
red
sox
shutout
chicago
white
sox
it
is
red
sox
th
win
of
this
season
so
far
red
sox
won
all
the
games
roger
and
frank
v
pitched
and
when
other
three
starters
were
pitching
tomorrow
dopson
will
pitch
again
have
a
good
first
start
and
rocky
second
start
i
wonder
that
bosox
can
play
over
ball
without
roger
and
frank
v
as
long
as
the
yankees
are
in
the
same
division
the
red
sox
will
play
better
than
baseball
or
the
red
sox
can
hire
former
east
german
swimming
coaches
to
train
them
at
the
fine
art
of
body
building
the
red
sox
can
use
chinese
women
swimmers
as
a
reference
with
the
hawk
the
red
sox
definitely
have
a
chance
for
the
east
this
year
he
brings
class
work
ethic
and
leadership
to
the
park
each
day
and
he
has
a
burning
desire
to
play
in
the
world
series
future
halloffamer
andre
dawson
will
kick
butt
in
