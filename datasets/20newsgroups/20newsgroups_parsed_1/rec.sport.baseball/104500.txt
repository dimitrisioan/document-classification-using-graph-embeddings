spike
owen
sure
hes
hitting
like
crazy
but
the
guy
can
not
field
to
save
his
life
and
they
said
he
was
brought
in
to
provide
defense
velarde
stankiewicz
and
even
silvestri
are
better
defensively
than
owen
remember
its
still
early
look
for
his
offense
to
tail
off
and
his
defense
to
improve
hopefully
he
has
that
rep
because
i
heard
that
either
last
year
or
over
the
last
years
or
something
like
that
he
has
the
third
highest
fielding
percentage
among
major
league
shortstops
behind
cr
and
tony
im
not
gon
na
help
this
sorry
mets
team
at
all
fernandez
i
do
agree
though
that
he
has
not
looked
all
that
impressive
in
the
field
thus
far
owen
only
has
one
error
so
far
i
believe
that
seriously
underrepresents
the
harm
he
has
done
in
the
field
owen
will
cleanly
play
any
ball
he
reaches
he
will
have
a
fine
fielding
percentage
like
always
the
problem
is
that
he
doesnt
reach
anything
that
isnt
hit
straight
at
him
this
wouldnt
be
quite
as
obvious
a
problem
if
he
were
playing
next
to
kelly
gruber
or
robin
ventura
but
the
third
baseman
for
the
yankees
is
wade
boggs
who
should
have
moved
across
the
diamond
last
year
ive
only
seen
one
game
abbotts
first
start
but
there
were
three
balls
hit
to
the
left
side
which
would
have
been
stopped
by
quality
defensive
players
instead
they
were
charged
as
hits
against
abbott
