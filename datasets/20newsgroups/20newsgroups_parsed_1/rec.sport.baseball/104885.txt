hey
folks
saw
the
giants
play
ball
at
the
stick
saturday
april
it
was
the
game
where
pendelton
broke
up
the
scoreless
tie
in
the
ninth
with
a
twoout
tworun
homer
to
right
to
win
it
it
wasnt
the
game
where
the
fans
threw
the
giveaway
fotoballs
onto
the
field
in
response
to
the
homer
too
bad
huh
well
the
stick
is
still
cold
the
saturday
game
ended
at
pm
and
it
was
cold
then
i
cant
imagine
night
games
in
april
at
the
stick
the
wind
kicked
up
a
little
too
and
i
got
this
idea
at
most
games
theres
a
pile
of
hot
dog
wrappers
and
cups
and
trash
on
the
field
a
lot
of
the
time
i
propose
a
kids
cleanup
corps
composed
mainly
of
year
old
kids
who
would
love
nothing
better
than
to
run
out
on
the
field
in
the
fifth
inning
when
the
guy
in
the
toro
smooths
the
infield
and
grab
the
trash
it
might
not
be
glamorous
but
at
that
age
i
probably
would
have
given
anything
to
be
on
the
field
with
the
ballplayers
everybody
wins
here
whaddaya
think
sean
i
was
at
opening
day
the
stadium
and
new
owners
were
great
i
pick
candlesti
ck
anytime
over
the
giants
playing
out
of
state
i
only
wish
the
buttheads
in
san
jose
had
enough
balls
to
vote
for
a
stadium
here
