hey
valentine
i
dont
see
boston
with
any
world
series
rings
on
their
fingers
damn
morris
now
has
three
and
probably
the
hall
of
fame
in
his
future
therefore
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easily
made
the
best
signing
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
this
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the
division
more
like
th
yeah
valentine
how
many
rings
does
clemens
have
nothin
like
good
old
fashioned
canadian
logic
btw
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
the
jays
rotation
this
year
is
that
it
could
have
been
worse
stewart
might
have
stayed
healthy
cordially
as
always
so
many
morons
rm
and
so
little
time
