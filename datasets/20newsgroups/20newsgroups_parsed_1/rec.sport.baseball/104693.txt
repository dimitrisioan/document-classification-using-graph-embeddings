does
any
one
out
there
listen
to
wfan
for
those
of
you
who
do
not
know
what
i
am
talking
about
it
is
an
all
sports
radio
staion
in
new
york
on
a
clear
night
the
signal
reaches
up
and
down
the
east
coast
in
particular
i
want
to
know
how
len
berman
and
mike
lupicas
show
is
i
go
to
school
in
virginia
so
i
cant
listen
when
there
are
on
during
the
day
just
wondering
the
fan
is
an
okay
sports
radio
station
but
doesnt
come
close
to
the
ultimate
in
sports
radio
wip
in
philadelphia
the
signal
might
not
be
as
powerful
but
then
again
only
stations
in
new
york
feel
obligated
to
pollute
everyone
elses
airwaves
with
a
bunch
of
hoodlum
mets
fans
complaining
hours
a
day
wip
took
two
of
your
best
sports
jockeys
too
jody
macdonald
and
steve
fredericks
wip
is
rockin
with
sports
talk
from
am
till
midnight
check
it
out
anytime
your
within
a
few
hours
of
philadelphia
if
im
not
mistaken
wip
has
the
highest
sports
talk
ratings
in
the
nation
im
from
dallas
and
you
have
alot
of
nerve
saying
that
wfan
has
a
bunch
of
hoodlum
mets
fans
during
the
football
season
the
local
cowboy
station
here
had
the
wip
on
several
times
for
simultanious
broadcasts
i
have
never
heard
a
bigger
bunch
of
low
intellect
bed
wetting
obnoxious
woofing
cranial
deformed
assholes
in
my
entire
life
the
iq
of
the
average
eagles
fan
must
be
in
the
range
at
best
and
they
have
been
known
to
be
big
droolers
please
no
flames
lets
see
if
it
