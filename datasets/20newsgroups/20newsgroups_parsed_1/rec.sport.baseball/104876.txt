as
to
whether
it
does
him
any
good
to
have
bonds
behind
him
the
netstatmavens
will
probably
tell
you
theres
no
reason
that
it
should
but
if
he
thinks
it
will
it
might
be
a
selffulfilling
prophecy
i
dont
understand
if
it
is
williams
lack
of
ability
which
you
say
above
and
i
agree
with
which
causes
him
to
swing
at
bad
pitches
how
will
thinking
that
bonds
hitting
behind
him
will
help
him
to
stop
chasing
bad
pitches
i
didnt
mean
that
it
would
necessarily
help
him
improve
at
that
specific
deficiency
i
meant
that
if
having
bonds
bat
behind
him
gives
williams
possibly
unfounded
confidence
that
might
translate
into
more
hitting
productivity
but
youre
right
if
williams
biggest
problem
is
more
physical
than
mental
thats
less
likely
to
make
a
difference
