hi
i
was
just
wondering
if
anyone
knew
when
erickson
and
keith
miller
are
expected
to
come
back
and
what
exactly
ails
them
dunno
about
miller
if
you
mean
scott
erickson
currently
the
reigning
twins
least
consistent
good
player
he
pulled
a
muscle
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
rib
cage
that
made
it
essentially
impossible
for
him
to
pitch
temporarily
and
is
expected
back
on
the
mound
sunday
david
thornley
with
tickets
to
see
one
of
the
scott
ericksons
pitch
