how
can
brooks
be
i
think
he
would
at
least
be
ahead
of
ron
santo
because
a
small
advantage
in
fielding
ability
comes
nowhere
near
making
up
for
the
large
difference
in
hitting

even
if
robinsons
extra

are
taken
to

he
was
responsible
for
more

in

that
doesnt
make
up
for
the
extra
outs
he
made
at
the

not
to
mention
the
fewer
total
bases
the
difference
of

should
be
decreased
by
about
to
account
for

a
difference
is
still
considerable

usual
disclaimers
about

fr
apply
but
they
really
shouldnt
be
way
off
the
mark
in
this
comparison
at
least
its
better
than
fielding
percentage
carney
lansford
has
a
th
best
alltime
but
fr
dead
last
of
all
time
also
since
this
total
rating
compares
players
to
league
average
instead
of
replacement
level
robinson
should
be
awarded
an
extra
or
so
for
playing
more
games
he
had
a
great
career
but
i
would
prefer
santos
plus
years
of
a
replacement
level
bman
but
i
would
knock
traynor
off
the
list
and
replace
him
by
stan
hack
thats
a
similar
story
hacks
far
better
hitting
outweighs
traynors
superior
fielding
graig
nettles
and
buddy
bell
would
also
be
better
choices
imho
of
course
though
some
recent
net
discussion
supports
this
point
of
view
cf
andre
dawson
shouldnt
that
be
right
