very
interesting
gehrig
below
bonds
and
schmidt
ricky
henderson
he
could
steal
bases
but
his
hitting
stats
are
not
even
close
to
dimmagios
uhhhh
where
is
winfield
hendersons
stats
are
probably
closer
to
dimaggios
than
you
think
then
give
me
numbers
man
winfield
could
whip
hendersons
butt
at
what
basestealing
not
hendersons
alltime
leader
and
is
good
for
about
runs
worth
of
sb
lifetime
winfield
is
about
sb
behind
and
has
a
net
runs
onbase
average
winfields
best
year
was
nine
points
below
hendersons
lifetime
oba
lifetime
the
diff
is
points
slugging
winfield
by
points
theyre
both
good
ofs
though
winfield
looks
better
with
his
huge
bod
winfields
best
year
henderson
tb
iii
gives
henderson
a
total
player
rating
of
winfield
of
they
have
rickey
as
a
much
better
fielder
which
i
dont
buy
but
henderson
is
simply
the
best
leadoff
hitter
of
all
time
and
winfield
isnt
the
best
anything
of
all
time
henderson
is
the
best
leadoff
hitter
of
alltime
arguably
winfield
has
meant
more
to
his
team
than
henderson
unlike
daryll
henderson
tries
hard
he
is
an
amazing
centerfielder
rickey
is
very
good
maybe
better
than
winfield
i
was
angry
at
the
dissing
of
winfield
though
winfield
has
been
better
than
henderson
lately
check
the
numbers
winfield
may
surprise
you
he
will
have
basehits
and
should
have
homeruns
when
he
retireswishful
thiniking
if
he
plays
