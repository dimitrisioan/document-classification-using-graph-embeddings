jack
morris
roger
maynard
writes
it
sure
does
and
it
all
depends
on
the
definition
that
you
use
for
better
yours
is
based
on
what
could
have
been
and
mine
is
based
on
what
really
happened
well
actually
most
of
ours
is
based
on
what
really
happened
and
yours
is
based
on
some
fantasy
of
how
it
happened
but
thats
ok
i
understand
you
have
a
hockey
background
stats
like
plusminus
make
rbi
look
good
is
it
violas
fault
that
boston
had
no
offense
is
it
because
of
morris
that
the
blue
jays
had
such
a
strong
offense
dont
tell
me
that
morris
has
this
magical
ability
to
cause
the
offensive
players
to
score
more
runs
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
your
problem
you
are
isolating
violas
contribution
from
the
rest
of
the
teams
efforts
you
can
only
do
this
if
you
can
say
for
sure
what
the
team
would
have
done
without
viola
only
then
can
you
compare
but
you
can
not
know
how
the
team
would
have
done
without
viola
your
analysis
is
fallacious
ok
how
about
a
straigh
answer
then
heres
a
very
simele
question
to
which
im
sure
a
fair
number
of
us
are
very
interesed
in
the
answer
to
please
answer
yes
or
no
roger
can
a
pitcher
cause
the
offensive
players
on
his
team
to
score
more
runs
al
only
please
for
anyone
else
following
along
it
is
a
wellknown
and
demonstrable
fact
that
a
teams
winloss
record
is
closely
related
to
the
number
of
runs
the
team
scores
and
the
number
the
team
allows
its
not
a
definite
hardandfast
function
but
there
is
definitely
a
correlation
in
fact
as
a
rule
of
thumb
if
teams
a
and
b
both
score
x
runs
and
team
a
allows
y
runs
for
every
runs
fewer
than
y
that
team
b
allows
it
will
win
another
game
so
for
instance
if
we
look
at
the
toronto
blue
jays
we
find
that
they
scored
runs
and
allowed
of
which
morris
allowed
all
other
things
being
equal
if
frank
viola
with
his
era
had
replaced
jack
morris
for
the
innings
morris
threw
plausible
since
viola
threw
for
boston
the
red
jays
would
have
allowed
about
fewer
runs
or
enough
for
more
wins
now
that
doesnt
take
into
account
that
viola
pitched
half
his
innings
in
fenway
which
is
a
harder
park
to
pitch
in
particularly
for
a
lefthander
than
skydome
so
um
roger
unless
you
really
do
believe
that
a
pitcher
can
somehow
affect
the
number
of
runs
his
team
scores
could
you
enlighten
us
to
the
fallacy
in
this
analysis
clearly
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
claim
that
viola
would
necessarily
have
put
up
a
if
he
had
been
on
the
jay
last
year
but
that
is
not
the
claim
we
look
at
what
the
actual
performances
were
and
evaluate
violas
as
better
than
morris
in
the
sense
that
had
morris
performed
as
viola
did
his
team
would
have
been
better
off
it
takes
an
open
mind
to
really
truly
understand
what
is
happening
out
here
in
the
real
world
guys
this
is
true
but
not
so
open
that
