i
agree
though
id
also
be
happy
with
a
stadium
that
looks
like
new
comiskey
the
new
park
was
also
made
for
baseball
unlike
three
rivers
the
vet
riverfront
etc
its
not
a
football
park
in
which
they
also
play
baseball
while
were
on
the
multipurpose
subject
lets
not
forget
shea
which
was
designed
to
accommodate
both
the
mets
jets
it
was
the
first
stadium
i
think
to
have
the
box
seats
on
rollers
so
they
could
be
oriented
at
right
angles
for
baseball
in
parallel
for
football
not
the
first
rfk
olim
dc
stadium
was
built
years
earlier
nowadays
they
dont
move
the
seats
back
for
the
few
exhibition
games
but
the
rdbaself
lower
deck
used
to
move
it
was
all
metal
which
was
pretty
noisy
on
bat
day
of
course
with
the
jets
gone
to
jersey
and
a
truly
good
football
stadium
the
mets
are
saddled
with
a
multipurpose
stadium
where
because
its
circular
the
seats
are
almost
always
too
far
from
the
action
the
mets
announcerskiner
murphy
in
particularhave
always
hyped
it
as
beautiful
shea
stadium
a
tipoff
to
how
unbeautiful
it
truly
is
its
vastly
better
than
it
was
before
they
fixed
it
though
back
in
the
late
s
it
was
a
dump
