and
finally
id
like
to
point
out
that
many
high
obp
guys
draw
their
walks
more
because
pitchers
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
because
they
have
a
great
eye
this
comes
up
periodically
and
i
just
dont
get
it
take
for
example
mark
mcgwire
he
walked
times
in
if
thats
not
a
potential
great
example
of
what
youre
talking
about
then
i
dont
know
what
is
now
lets
look
at
what
happens
when
mcgwire
doesnt
walk
of
the
time
he
made
an
out
of
the
time
he
hit
a
single
of
the
time
he
hit
a
double
of
the
time
he
hit
a
homer
now
youre
pitching
against
mcgwire
would
you
trade
walks
for
homers
double
singles
and
outs
i
would
why
give
him
the
base
when
you
can
get
him
out
times
out
of
then
there
are
guys
like
alex
cole
who
has
a
career
obp
even
though
hes
never
had
a
batting
average
over
he
did
hit
in
ab
in
or
hit
a
single
home
run
yep
thats
right
hes
never
hit
a
homer
in
abs
through
the
end
of
whod
be
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
him
