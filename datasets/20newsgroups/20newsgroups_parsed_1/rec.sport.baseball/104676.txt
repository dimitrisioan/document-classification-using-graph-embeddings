hey
valentine
i
dont
see
boston
with
any
world
series
rings
on
their
fingers
yah
so
damn
morris
now
has
three
and
probably
the
hall
of
fame
in
his
future
he
certainly
didnt
earn
his
last
one
how
many
games
did
he
blow
in
the
world
series
all
of
the
ones
he
started
he
certainly
did
earn
it
he
was
a
valuable
member
of
the
blue
jay
team
not
particularly
in
the
world
series
during
the
season
he
was
probably
more
valuable
than
say
putting
olerud
out
there
to
pitch
but
yeah
he
was
valuable
in
getting
them
there
in
the
postseason
he
sucked
dirty
canal
water
through
a
straw
the
jays
won
in
spite
of
morris
much
more
than
because
of
him
therefore
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easily
made
the
best
signing
oh
yes
definitely
therefore
morris
is
better
than
clemens
your
definition
of
better
refers
to
some
measurement
on
a
scale
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
winning
ws
rings
umm
roger
return
with
us
to
those
halcyon
days
of
a
few
postings
ago
where
the
poster
valentine
was
replying
to
used
of
ws
rings
as
a
measure
of
better
the
concept
is
called
context
and
you
should
really
become
familiar
with
it
someday
the
facts
are
that
morris
has
shown
us
that
he
has
what
it
takes
to
play
on
a
ws
winning
club
clemens
hasnt
unless
this
transaltes
to
clemens
hasnt
gone
into
lou
gormans
office
with
a
large
caliber
handgun
and
refused
to
come
out
until
hed
been
traded
to
the
jays
im
at
a
complete
loss
as
to
any
possible
meaning
for
it
you
can
go
on
about
what
clemens
has
done
in
the
past
and
claim
that
he
is
better
than
morris
if
you
want
to
but
the
facts
are
that
morris
has
shown
us
that
he
can
win
and
clemens
hasnt
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
over
their
careers
clemens
has
won
of
the
games
hes
started
morris
per
year
clemens
has
averaged
nearly
wins
morris
just
under
would
you
grant
the
proposition
that
preventing
the
other
team
from
scoring
increases
your
chances
of
winning
a
game
if
so
then
consider
that
clemens
allows
runs
innings
pitched
morris
allows
nearly
a
run
more
per
nine
innings
in
fact
jack
morris
has
never
in
his
career
had
an
era
for
a
single
year
as
good
as
clemens
career
era
but
i
forget
in
the
maynardverse
there
was
obviously
some
mystical
significance
to
buckner
missing
that
grounder
in
had
morris
been
on
the
sox
it
would
have
been
a
routine
groundout
right
whether
or
not
clemens
is
better
by
your
standard
of
measurement
is
totally
meaningless
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
compile
high
figures
in
statistics
that
you
have
chosen
to
feel
are
important
the
object
of
the
game
is
to
contribute
to
ws
victories
but
this
has
been
patiently
explained
to
you
many
many
times
and
you
are
either
too
stupid
or
too
stubborn
to
grasp
it
speaking
of
stupid
it
has
been
patiently
and
notsopatiently
explained
to
you
many
times
that
attributing
greatness
to
players
based
on
the
accomplishments
of
their
teams
makes
about
as
much
sense
as
claiming
that
a
racecar
has
the
most
attractive
paint
job
because
it
won
the
race
your
continued
failure
to
not
only
understand
but
even
to
intelligently
reply
to
any
of
the
arguments
presented
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
that
you
must
have
spent
a
few
too
many
games
in
goal
without
a
mask
dont
give
me
that
shit
if
boston
had
alomar
olerud
henke
and
ward
while
toronto
had
rivera
jack
clark
jeff
reardon
things
would
have
looked
a
little
different
last
fall
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
this
lavishing
of
praise
on
morris
makes
me
sick
yes
and
the
dog
would
have
caught
the
rabbit
tooforget
about
what
didnt
happen
and
open
your
eyes
for
once
and
look
out
there
and
see
what
is
really
happening
forget
about
how
morris
shouldnt
have
won
with
an
era
over
when
morris
pitched
last
year
the
jays
won
stop
crying
about
it
and
get
on
with
life
no
one
is
crying
the
jays
won
and
as
a
team
they
certainly
deserved
to
win
at
least
the
al
east
they
performed
well
in
two
short
series
and
won
the
world
series
and
i
congratulate
them
for
it
as
a
red
sox
fan
i
hope
they
keep
morris
i
was
happy
when
they
picked
up
stewart
and
elated
when
they
traded
for
darrin
jackson
you
see
unless
you
believe
in
some
mystical
link
between
morris
and
the
offense
you
can
hardly
help
but
believe
that
the
man
was
credited
with
so
many
wins
last
year
because
he
got
lucky
luck
runs
out
just
like
it
did
in
when
he
pitched
odd
more
innings
than
gave
up
exactly
one
earned
run
more
than
in
and
went
seriously
roger
id
really
like
to
hear
your
explanation
of
the
difference
between
the
morris
and
the
morris
which
one
was
a
better
pitcher
and
why
did
morris
somehow
learn
how
to
win
in
the
intervening
ten
years
if
so
then
why
did
he
go
in
with
minnesota
with
an
era
over
half
a
run
lower
than
mike
jones
aix
highend
development
dont
be
humble
youre
not
that
great
