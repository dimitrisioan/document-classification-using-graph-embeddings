alright
i
have
one
thing
to
say
i
dont
know
if
its
just
me
but
i
thought
this
newsgroup
is
a
place
for
discussion
why
must
people
constantly
post
these
little
messages
about
how
a
certain
team
is
winning
in
a
certain
inning
i
mean
come
on
how
many
people
are
so
dependent
on
this
newsgroup
that
they
have
to
find
out
the
scores
midgame
here
