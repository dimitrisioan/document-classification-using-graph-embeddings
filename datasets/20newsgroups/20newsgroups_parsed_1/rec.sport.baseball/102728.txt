now
keith
mitchell
as
i
recall
no
stat
books
handy
surprise
he
jumped
from
aa
to
atlanta
in
he
did
so
well
that
he
was
returned
to
the
minors
where
he
didnt
do
very
well
at
all
now
his
career
is
in
jeopardy
so
how
does
he
fit
in
with
your
point
good
mles
in
aa
moved
him
right
to
the
big
club
now
hes
one
step
away
from
being
traded
or
moved
out
of
baseball
duh
methinks
you
recall
wrong
mitchell
hit
close
to
in
atlanta
and
continued
to
walk
alot
after
his
promotion
he
was
then
i
think
left
off
the
playoff
roster
and
started
the
next
year
in
the
minors
where
even
the
braves
will
tell
you
he
underperformed
because
he
was
so
mad
at
going
back
down
he
struggled
last
year
no
doubt
but
even
the
braves
blamed
part
of
it
on
the
demotion
id
much
rather
have
mitchell
than
say
mark
whiten
on
the
cards
