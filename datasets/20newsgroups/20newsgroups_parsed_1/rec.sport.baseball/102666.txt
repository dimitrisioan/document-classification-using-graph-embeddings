my
predictions
i
thought
id
post
my
predicted
standings
since
i
find
those
posted
by
others
to
be
interesting
sorry
this
is
after
opening
day
i
certify
that
these
were
completed
before
the
first
pitch
al
east
new
york
yankees
the
most
only
improved
team
in
this
division
toronto
blue
jays
stewart
and
morris
no
way
milwaukee
brewers
they
always
seem
to
do
better
than
i
expect
baltimore
orioles
pitching
but
devareaux
anderson
and
hoiles
will
drop
cleveland
indians
still
dont
seem
to
know
what
they
are
doing
detroit
tigers
all
key
players
but
fryman
are
another
year
past
peak
boston
red
sox
any
team
with
clemens
and
viola
might
be
beter
than
th
al
west
this
division
was
the
toughest
for
me
to
pick
whoever
of
the
top
gets
pitching
should
win
it
minnesota
twins
young
pitchers
seem
to
have
best
chance
for
success
texas
rangers
i
dont
know
why
i
have
them
here
jose
canseco
chicago
white
sox
frank
thomas
but
no
pitching
oakland
as
larussa
is
the
best
manager
and
would
keep
any
team
close
seattle
mariners
i
like
pinella
but
dont
see
much
here
kansas
city
royals
will
score
no
runs
california
angels
will
win
no
games
nl
east
montreal
expos
good
all
around
plus
no
wallach
st
louis
cardinals
jeffries
whiten
jose
clark
no
galarraga
pittsburgh
pirates
youngsters
will
take
up
more
slack
than
expected
new
york
mets
some
good
players
still
not
a
team
philadelphia
phillies
they
dont
impress
me
florida
marlins
they
know
what
theyre
doing
chicago
cubs
they
dont
know
what
theyre
doing
nl
west
the
best
teams
in
baseball
are
in
this
division
atlanta
braves
awesome
starters
but
offense
could
be
a
concern
cincinnati
reds
would
not
surprise
me
if
they
won
it
all
houston
astros
any
team
that
signs
uribe
wont
contend
closer
to
than
san
diego
padres
plantier
could
be
the
sheffield
of
los
angeles
dodgers
better
pitching
than
the
giants
san
francisco
giants
because
the
rockies
just
stink
colorado
rockies
will
become
the
seattle
mariners
of
the
nl
nlcs
montreal
d
atlanta
braves
fans
yes
im
probably
contradicting
what
i
said
in
my
nl
west
comment
alcs
new
york
d
minnesota
world
series
new
york
d
montreal
hating
the
yankees

be
fashionable
again
nl
mvp
barry
bonds
or
maybe
mcgriff
nl
cy
young
jose
rijo
al
mvp
frank
thomas
will
deserve
it
again
but
fielder

win
it
al
cy
young

deserve
it
again
