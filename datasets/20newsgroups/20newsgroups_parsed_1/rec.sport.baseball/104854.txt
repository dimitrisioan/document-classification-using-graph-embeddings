revisited
total
baseball
which
also
tries
to
evaluate
a
players
total
offensive
and
defensive
contributions
gives
barry
bonds
a
total
player
rating
of
for
only
one
other
player
since
ruth
attained
that
mark
cal
ripken
for
his
season
rounding
out
the

offensive
players
in
the

sheffield

and
larkin
the
top
offensive
players
in
the

were

anderson
r
henderson
and
thomas
in

total
baseball
says
bonds
enjoyed
one
of
the
best
seasons
ever
in
the
games
history
better
than
any
year
had

mays

etc
if
you
disagree
dont
flame
me
flame
the
writers
of
total
baseball
also
martinez
and
ventura
are
neck
and
neck
so
given
the
shortcomings
of
any
statistical
analysis
which
one
had
the
better
year
can
be
considered
a
tossup
thus
total
baseball
supports
your
choices
of
bonds
and
ventura
as
