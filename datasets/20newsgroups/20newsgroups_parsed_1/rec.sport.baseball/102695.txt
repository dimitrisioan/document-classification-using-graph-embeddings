cubs
behind
marlins
how
ive
noticed
that
is
has
become
fashionable
lately
in
rsb
to
predict
the
marlines
to
finish
ahead
of
the
cubshow
first
base
grace
vs
destradecould
destrade
be
the
second
coming
of
cecil
fielder
i
doubt
it
if
destrade
performs
to
the
height
of
expectations
then
even
otherwise
edge
to
cubs
second
base
sandberg
vs
barberieno
contest
sandberg
will
be
back
may
edge
to
cubsa
big
edge
shortstop
vizcaino
vs
weissvizcaino
is
excellent
defensively
but
is
an
automatic
out
at
bat
weiss
isnt
much
better
with
the
stick
even
third
base
dave
magadan
vs
buechellemagadan
has
a
higher
obp
and
is
a
better
hitter
buechelle
has
more
power
and
is
better
defensively
i
think
edge
to
florida
catcher
santiago
vs
wilkinswilkins
is
ok
but
santiago
is
better
edge
to
marlins
left
field
conine
vs
maldonadowow
for
yesterdayi
know
conine
has
potential
i
watched
him
play
at
omaha
the
last
couple
years
until
he
actually
proves
himself
i
give
maldonado
the
edge
however
like
at
b
this
is
position
where
florida
might
be
even
or
better
if
the
player
there
has
a
huge
year
center
scott
pose
vs
wilsonmayedge
to
may
even
if
wilson
hopefully
the
cubs
will
use
may
and
save
wilson
for
pinch
running
and
the
like
may
isnt
ken
griffey
jr
but
he
will
hit
with
homers
if
he
plays
full
time
right
felix
vs
sosafelix
jose
has
occasional
power
and
a
bad
obp
so
does
sosa
but
sosa
also
has
speed
and
a
good
glove
edge
to
cubs
starters
aquino
armstrong
hammond
a
lot
of
fifth
starters
here
the
cubs
wont
remind
anyone
of
the
brave
staff
but
morgancastilloguzmanhibbard
is
average
to
okbetter
than
the
marline
edge
to
cubs
middle
relief
even
the
cubs
have
some
decent
middlemen
and
so
do
the
marlins
carpenter
anf
klink
or
decent
but
so
are
assenmacher
and
mcelroy
closer
a
healthy
harvey
is
a
big
edge
to
the
marlins
meyers
is
decent
but
no
harvey
of
course
the
cubs
may
have
a
few
more
games
to
save
look
for
saves
blown
from
meyers
and
saves
blown
with
a
better
era
for
harvey
edge
florida
overall
an
edge
to
chicago
neither
of
these
teams
will
threaten
to
win
anything
of
course
e
go
cubs
one
likes
to
believe
in
the
freedom
of
baseball
