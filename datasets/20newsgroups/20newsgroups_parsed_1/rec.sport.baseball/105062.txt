the
original
poster
wanted
to
know
how
the
big
cat
looked
i
was
also
at
the
saturday
game
in
montreal
apr
that
rockies
won
i
havent
paid
much
attention
to
gallarraga
since
he
left
the
expos
but
his
stance
seemed
to
be
much
different
he
stands
more
erect
and
very
open
with
his
left
foot
pointing
to
rd
base
im
wondering
if
this
is
a
recent
change
in
stance
for
him
andres
had
one
glaring
weakness
as
a
hitter
he
could
always
be
fooled
by
a
curve
ball
low
and
away
if
this
is
indeed
a
new
stance
for
him
maybe
he
is
not
being
fooled
as
easily
yes
the
stance
is
new
don
baylor
was
his
batting
coach
at
st
louis
last
year
and
now
as
his
manager
is
continuing
to
work
with
him
maybe
andres
has
a
weak
left
eye
and
the
open
stance
gives
him
a
better
look
at
the
ball
or
maybe
it
is
simply
improving
his
mechanics
i
dunno
but
the
change
seems
to
have
enabled
him
to
hit
the
ball
as
well
as
years
ago
his
selectivity
has
not
changed
