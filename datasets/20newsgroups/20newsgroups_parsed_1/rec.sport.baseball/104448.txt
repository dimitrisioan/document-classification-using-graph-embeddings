dimensional
teams
was
re
royals
final
run
total
in
a
previous
article
sean
sweda
says
ive
been
saying
this
for
quite
some
time
but
being
absent
from
the
net
for
a
while
i
figured
id
stick
my
neck
out
a
bit
the
royals
will
set
the
record
for
fewest
runs
scored
by
an
al
team
since
the
inception
of
the
dh
rule
ps
any
ideas
what
this
is
they
will
fall
easily
short
of
runs
thats
for
damn
sure
i
cant
believe
these
media
fools
picking
them
to
win
the
division
like
our
tom
gage
of
the
detroit
news
claiming
herk
robinson
is
some
kind
of
genius
for
the
tradesaquisitions
hes
made
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
dodgers
in
or
true
cone
is
probably
as
good
as
drysdale
and
they
have
no
koufax
but
still
these
teams
were
winning
with
home
run
leaders
who
had
very
bad
totals
with
lots
of
lowscoring
games
etc
and
they
didnt
use
relievers
whereas
jeff
montgomery
is
having
a
super
season
for
them
that
being
said
i
still
picked
them
th
or
so
but
i
think
a
superb
pitching
team
can
win
if
they
have
enough
hitting
theres
more
of
a
chance
of
that
i
think
than
of
a
team
with
tremendous
hitting
but
no
pitching
at
least
to
me
i
wonder
though
which
one
do
you
people
think
would
do
better
a
team
with
johnson
koufax
in
his
prime
seaver
carlton
and
young
in
no
real
order
as
the
starters
with
sutter
fingers
and
lyle
in
the
bullpen
but
with
a
puny
offense
assuming
good
defense
like
mazeroski
maranville
etc
or
a
team
with
poor
pitching
but
with
an
offense
of
cobb
carew
ruth
gehrig
mays
schmidt
wagner
and
bench
againyou
pick
the
order
i
would
postulate
that
the
pitching
one
would
be
several
games
better
by
seasons
end
even
the
best
hitters
can
succeed
only
of
the
time
in
their
best
years
but
a
great
pitcher
can
throw
lots
of
shutouts
taking
all
the
players
in
their
prime
they
might
throw
shutouts
in
a
year
and
all
the
offense
would
have
to
do
is
get
run
across
i
wonder
if
someone
with
stratomatic
or
something
could
plug
such
all
time
teams
into
a
regular
season
have
it
played
and
report
the
results
i
would
love
to
see
that
doug
fowler
me
age
now
mommys
and
daddys
other
ever
wonder
if
after
casey
relatives
have
to
give
lots
of
hugs
love
missed
the
rd
strike
in
the
poem
support
cause
heaven
is
just
a
great
he
ran
to
first
and
made
it
big
hug
that
lasts
forever
and
ever
