second
basemen
in
history
he
probably
didnt
even
have
as
good
a
season
as
alomar
last
year
guess
which
line
is
which
ba
obp
slg
ab

b
b
hr
bb
x
y
the
walks
should
give
it
away
obps
in
general
somewhat
more
valuable
than
slugging
and
alomars
edge
in
obp
was
quite
a
bit
larger
than
baergas
edge
in
slugging
im
no
sdcn
but
whats
more
valuable
hits
w
more
doubles
more
hrs
or
more
triples
and
bbs
lets
not
forget
the
extra
sbs
how
many
cs
of
course
the
hits
and
homers
are
more
valuable
but
dont
forget
the
outs
you
cant
have
it
both
ways
baergas
higher
raw
numbers
are
due
to
him
having
more
playing
time
and
thus
he
had
more
hits
and
homers
but
dont
forget
the
cost
of
those
outs
btw
just
to
answer
your
question
alomar
had
sb
and
cs
baerga
had
sb
and
cs
which
gives
a
minute
plus
on
alomars
side
something
else
to
consider
alomars
hr
splits
were
slg
obp
baergas
was
and
pretty
clearly
alomar
got
a
huge
boost
from
his
home
park
id
say
you
could
make
a
good
for
them
being
about
equal
right
now
tp
rated
baerga
higher
