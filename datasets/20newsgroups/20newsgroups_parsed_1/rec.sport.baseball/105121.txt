final
run
total
ive
been
saying
this
for
quite
some
time
but
being
absent
from
the
net
for
a
while
i
figured
id
stick
my
neck
out
a
bit
the
royals
will
set
the
record
for
fewest
runs
scored
by
an
al
team
since
the
inception
of
the
dh
rule
ps
any
ideas
what
this
is
they
will
fall
easily
short
of
runs
thats
for
damn
sure
i
cant
believe
these
media
fools
picking
them
to
win
the
division
like
our
tom
gage
of
the
detroit
news
claiming
herk
robinson
is
some
kind
of
