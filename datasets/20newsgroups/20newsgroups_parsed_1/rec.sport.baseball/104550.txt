joe
torre
has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
educate
yourself
before
you
rip
on
this
years
manager
of
the
year
lankford
injured
himself
in
a
previous
game
and
torre
was
resting
him
as
far
as
the
whittengilkey
controversy
whitten
adds
some
more
needed
power
and
if
jordan
continues
to
hit
the
way
he
has
been
gilkey
will
find
himself
in
the
starting
lineup
soon
enough
