dave
kingman
for
the
hall
of
fame
hi
baseball
fans
so
what
do
you
say
dont
you
think
he
deserves
it
i
mean
heck
if
dave
winfield
hohum
is
seriously
being
considered
for
it
as
is
lee
smith
ha
then
why
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chance
or
darrell
evans
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of
fame
takes
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddie
murray
and
jeff
reardon
well
in
any
case
i
am
sick
and
tired
mostly
sick
of
everybody
giving
hall
of
fame
consideration
to
players
that
are
by
todays
standards
marginal
honestly
ozzie
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyre
both
shortstops
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
lets
be
a
little
more
selective
huh
stop
handing
out
these
honors
so
liberally
save
them
for
the
guys
who
really
deserve
it
face
it
if
something
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
