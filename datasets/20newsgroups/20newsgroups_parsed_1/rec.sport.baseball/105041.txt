yeah
morris
just
knows
how
to
win
thats
why
he
lost
for
detroit
in
funny
how
he
wins
a
lot
of
games
when
he
pitches
on
good
teams
but
loses
a
lot
when
he
pitches
on
bad
ones
and
if
rings
was
the
only
criteria
for
success
then
teams
would
always
tend
to
repeat
and
eventually
youd
have
the
same
team
win
the
ws
every
bleepin
year
sort
of
like
the
yanks
in
the
s
morris
is
a
decent
pitcher
on
the
downside
of
a
good
not
great
career
toronto
will
finish
rd
or
th
this
year
with
morris
and
all
those
rings
because
their
pitching
staff
was
destroyed
over
the
offseason
