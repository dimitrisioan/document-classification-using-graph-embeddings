the
reason
im
unhappy
with
the
length
of
games
today
is
summed
up
above
for
an
extra
minutesgame
average
in
the
al
and
an
extra
minutes
average
in
the
nl
im
seeing
fewer
runs
score
now
what
i
think
i
am
seeing
is
more
pitches
more
strikeouts
over
game
in
the
al
over
game
more
in
the
nl
more
walks
game
more
in
yep
and
the
ks
dont
have
to
denote
a
slow
game
either
last
night
sid
fernandez
was
mowing
the
giants
hitters
down
ks
in
innings
yet
the
first
innings
of
the
game
were
quite
brisk
he
also
threw
pitches
leading
me
to
believe
it
isnt
just
the
number
of
pitches
that
determines
the
length
of
a
game
but
the
behavior
between
pitches
