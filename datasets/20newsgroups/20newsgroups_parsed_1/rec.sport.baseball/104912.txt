park
experience
long
ive
been
a
giants
season
ticket
holder
for
years
and
never
really
complained
about
the
old
ballyard
place
sure
its
been
cold
the
food
lines
were
long
and
the
hired
hands
were
surly
but
this
was
all
part
of
the
giants
mystique
or
so
i
thought
i
went
to
tuesdays
game
giants
over
the
marlins
and
the
stick
was
a
much
different
place
nothing
short
of
a
dome
will
eliminate
the
wind
but
everything
is
a
lot
better
the
lines
are
a
lot
shorter
the
bathrooms
are
clean
and
have
running
water
and
the
hired
hands
were
very
polite
the
new
foghorn
lights
up
and
blows
after
each
homerun
and
the
wooden
fence
are
very
nice
as
are
the
new
bleachers
the
bleachers
start
right
at
the
top
of
the
fence
and
give
a
great
view
and
theyve
got
beer
stands
at
the
bottome
of
the
bleachers
the
only
complaint
is
that
the
electronic
oldfashioned
scoreboard
looks
electronic
could
be
better
these
things
should
have
been
done
a
long
time
ago
but
it
took
a
real
businessman
ex
safeway
president
peter
magowan
to
figure
it
out
just
like
he
used
to
tell
his
checkers
if
the
customers
dont
come
back
i
dont
need
as
many
checkers
this
isnt
a
knock
on
bob
lurie
he
was
a
competent
businessman
but
he
didnt
deal
much
with
the
general
public
ill
give
an
example
of
how
the
level
of
service
has
changed
the
onion
dispenser
jammed
as
i
was
using
it
an
attendant
came
over
apoligized
for
the
problem
and
proceeded
to
fix
the
machine
after
he
was
done
he
cleaned
the
machine
and
said
he
was
glad
to
be
able
to
help
in
the
old
days
there
was
no
attendant
and
the
folks
at
the
concession
stands
would
say
go
to
the
stand
feet
away
they
might
be
able
to
help
all
in
all
it
was
a
fun
day
