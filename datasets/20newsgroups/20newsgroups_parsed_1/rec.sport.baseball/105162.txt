this
weeks
play
it
took
three
days
to
get
to
us
but
ill
try
anyway
as
i
naturally
havent
seen
the
answer
with
runners
at
first
and
second
and
one
out
the
batter
hits
an
easy
pop
fly
to
the
third
baseman
a
the
umpires
declare
the
infield
fly
rule
and
the
third
baseman
lets
the
ball
drop
the
runner
at
second
heads
for
third
and
the
third
baseman
flips
the
ball
to
the
short
stop
who
tags
the
bag
before
the
runner
safe
the
correct
call
is
infield
fly
batter
out
if
fair
runners
may
advance
at
own
risk
got
ta
tag
up
if
caught
etc
it
is
not
a
force
and
the
pop
was
not
caught
so
regardless
of
whether
the
ss
tags
b
or
b
it
wasnt
clear
above
he
hasnt
got
the
runner
out
b
the
umpires
dont
declare
the
infield
fly
rule
and
the
third
baseman
allows
the
ball
to
drop
and
throws
to
the
short
stop
who
tags
the
runner
from
second
while
the
runner
is
between
second
and
third
out
see
rule
l
approved
ruling
below
in
this
case
the
umpire
has
decided
for
whatever
reason
that
the
infield
fly
rule
doesnt
apply
sounds
like
a
bad
call
here
but
thats
not
the
point
the
batter
is
not
out
so
a
force
situation
is
created
therefore
the
runner
is
out
unless
by
rule
l
the
ball
is
dead
and
the
batter
is
safe
then
i
guess
the
runners
would
advance
unmolested
i
cant
really
tell
from
l
that
the
ball
is
dead
in
this
situation
whats
the
call
in
a
and
b
pertinent
rules
