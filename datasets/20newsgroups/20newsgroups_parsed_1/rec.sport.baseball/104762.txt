why
are
we
continuously
putting
down
other
universities
queens
is
not
as
great
as
is
makes
itself
out
to
be
this
place
has
only
got
a
good
rep
because
its
been
here
so
long
if
someone
would
take
the
time
to
look
around
and
see
how
dissatisfied
people
are
with
the
disorganization
and
the
constant
misuse
of
the
bell
curve
they
could
see
that
queens
needs
some
major
improvements
i
would
personally
start
with
hiring
professors
who
can
actually
teach
not
people
who
are
here
with
the
attitude
that
this
place
would
be
okay
if
it
wasnt
for
all
the
students
running
around
when
did
george

to
throw
a
curve
