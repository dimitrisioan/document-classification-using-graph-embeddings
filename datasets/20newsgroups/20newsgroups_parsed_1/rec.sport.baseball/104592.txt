i
dont
have
a
history
handy
but
i
dont
recall
that
the
preponderance
of
roys
come
from
winning
teams
in
fact
i
think
team
performance
is
generally
irrelevant
as
almost
always
the
most
deserving
candidate
wins
am
i
wrong
not
really
though
i
wouldnt
personally
say
the
most
deserving
candidate
wins
rarely
does
a
player
win
roy
when
called
up
in
mid
season
and
there
have
been
several
duds
in
recent
years
but
this
is
more
a
factor
of
mediot
biases
than
anything
else
i
wonder
if
amaral
hits
like
he
is
capable
of
will
he
receive
roty
votes
hes
only
he
could
have
a
long
career
ahead
of
him
and
he
is
not
necessarily
on
a
losing
team
while
the
angels
staff
is
still
very
weak
their
everyday
lineup
is
doing
quite
well
thank
you
snow
is
playing
great
salmon
is
learning
to
make
the
adjustments
easley
appears
fine
but
even
if
hes
not
flora
is
ready
to
come
up
between
gonzales
and
gruber
theyll
manage
the
hot
corner
polonia
and
curtis
are
steady
and
heady
even
myers
and
orton
are
contributing
personally
i
think
they
can
finish
over
which
makes
them
a
winning
team
i
think
they
are
a
seconddivision
team
they
should
finish
ahead
of
the
royals
mariners
and
possibly
athletics
but
i
dont
think
theyll
be
above
i
think
the
east
is
stronger
this
year
last
year
their
pitching
was
bad
and
their
offense
was
horrible
this
year
their
offense
is
better
but
their
pitching
is
still
pretty
bad
even
if
finley
returns
to
form
he
wont
replace
what
they
lost
in
abbott
sanderson
farrell
i
dont
believe
it
and
while
their
ba
may
be
good
and
they
have
decent
speed
their
offense
lacks
punch
they
dont
have
any
bona
fide
power
hitters
salmon
snow
davis
and
curtis
none
with
more
than
hr
potential
cheers
valentine
ps
which
al
team
had
the
most
steals
last
week
those
gogo
tigers
the
mediots
finally
managed
to
convince
them
that
they
needed
more
balance
in
their
lineup
you
see
they
were
scoring
too
many
runs
too
consistently
got
ta
run
more
to
break
that
up
