having
bonds
batting
behind
williams
means
that
matt
will
get
more
good
pitches
to
hit
this
is
important
since
he
struggles
so
much
with
breaking
balls
opposing
pitchers
dont
want
to
walk
williams
to
get
to
bonds
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
good
hitter
behind
you
argument
is
really
valid
has
anyone
done
a
study
on
this
