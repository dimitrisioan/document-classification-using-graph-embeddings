apochryphal
sp
don
drysdale
story
when
ordered
to
intentionally
walk
a
batter
who
had
hotdogged
on
him
in
two
previous
atbats
drysdale
reared
back
with
the
first
pitch
and
drilled
him
right
in
the
ribs
his
manager
came
storming
out
of
the
dugout
and
yelled
what
did
you
do
that
for
drysdale
growled
back
