actually
im
not
sure
that
philly
won
but
they
were
ahead
in
the
bottom
of
the
eighth
i
was
going
to
post
the
box
score
but
since
cinci
was
playing
so
criminally
bad
the
pub
i
was
at
had
to
turn
the
game
off
so
heres
whats
up
cincinnati
had
seven
hits
all
singles
by
the
end
of
the
eighth
this
makes
it
six
games
with
exactly
one
extra
base
hit
cincinnati
was
with
runners
in
scoring
position
now
if
a
team
is
going
to
be
completely
without
power
they
absolutely
have
to
hit
in
clutch
situations
cincinnati
starter
tom
browning
pitched
innings
giving
up
runs
and
h
its
while
striking
out
he
was
surely
the
loser
tonight
reds
starters
while
supposedly
solid
have
won
only
one
game
this
year
of
course
the
reds
have
only
won
two
cleanup
batter
sabo
went
besides
yesterdays
homer
hes
sucked
at
the
plate
dibble
may
not
actually
return
friday
this
may
not
mean
anything
since
cinci
may
not
find
themselves
in
a
save
situation
for
a
while
speaking
of
which
the
reds
have
ha
exactly
one
lead
this
week
for
oneand
ahalf
innings
after
chris
dinger
on
tuesday
manager
tony
perez
says
the
reds
are
just
not
swinging
the
bat
well
right
now
good
call
doggie
well
theres
a
big
difference
between
just
not
swinging
the
bat
well
and
what
the
reds
are
doing
at
the
plateuuuggghhhh
a
reds
fan
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
mike
why
is
it
that
the
prognosis
on
kevin
mitchell
is
out
days
no
matter
what
day
you
read
it
gary
burbank
ive
told
you
before
and
ill
tell
you
again
the
strong
survive
and
the
weak
disappear
we
do
not
intend
to
disappear
