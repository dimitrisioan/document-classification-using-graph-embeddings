sorry
this
doesnt
fly
the
good
players
have
always
been
ready
for
the
majors
early
how
many
hofers
were
not
contributing
major
leaguers
by
the
time
they
were
that
brings
up
an
interesting
point
anyone
else
catch
espns
piece
about
prospects
and
the
relationship
between
age
career
length
mvps
and
hall
of
fame
members
it
was
part
of
their
preseason
special
basically
they
looked
at
players
that
had
amassed
plate
appearances
or
abs
by
the
time
they
were
and
noticed
some
interesting
things
for
starters
they
found
out
such
players
comprised
the
majority
of
mvps
in
the
history
of
the
game
they
also
found
out
such
players
represented
the
majority
of
the
players
in
the
hall
of
fame
the
kicker
though
was
that
they
actually
did
some
numbercrunching
and
found
that
such
players
careers
lasted
much
longer
than
the
careers
of
players
not
in
that
group
they
also
found
that
these
players
produced
at
both
a
greater
level
of
performance
and
produced
over
twice
the
raw
totals
hrs
etc
of
the
other
players
the
first
group
outhit
the
second
something
like
to
in
raw
ba
and
blew
away
the
second
group
in
such
categories
as
hrs
bs
rbis
etc
it
was
the
most
impressive
thing
ive
seen
on
espn
in
recent
memory
