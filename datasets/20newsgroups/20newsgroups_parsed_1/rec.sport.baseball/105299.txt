ommited
well
its
just
studying
tape
frame
by
frame
thats
all
the
biggest
thing
that
you
notice
however
is
how
bastardized
the
strike
zone
has
become
death
to
the
umpires
union
the
plate
is
across
not
call
the
high
strikes
strikes
and
quit
calling
pitches
outside
strikes
theyre
balls
speaking
of
this
wide
strike
zone
id
sure
like
to
see
cameras
placed
in
each
major
league
park
such
that
an
overview
shot
of
home
plate
is
available
cbs
had
this
during
the
ws
or
did
i
just
dream
it
these
pictures
would
be
a
feedback
device
for
the
umpires
so
that
they
can
see
just
how
terrible
or
not
there
calls
were
tapes
could
be
sent
to
the
league
as
evidence
of
bad
ballstrike
umpiring
tapes
are
available
as
evidence
of
bad
outsafe
calls
on
the
bases
i
guess
that
nobody
noticed
that
the
calls
during
the
world
series
and
in
fact
all
year
have
been
pretty
much
consistently
correct
remember
the
rule
says
its
a
strike
if
any
part
of
the
ball
passes
through
the
strike
zone
i
would
certainly
agree
that
high
strikes
are
not
called
who
could
argue
this
point
but
all
in
all
i
think
in
and
out
is
called
pretty
well
