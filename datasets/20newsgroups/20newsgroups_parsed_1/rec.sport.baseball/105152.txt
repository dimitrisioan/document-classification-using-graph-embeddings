i
dont
understand
this
at
all
matt
williams
has
demonstrated
throughout
his
career
that
he
will
not
wait
for
good
pitches
to
hit
he
wont
take
walks
hed
rather
swing
if
im
the
opposing
pitcher
why
would
i
groove
a
fastball
to
williams
and
have
him
hit
it
well
when
i
know
that
williams
will
swing
and
miss
or
at
least
not
hit
very
well
at
a
low
and
away
curve
matts
problem
is
really
more
ability
than
attitude
it
isnt
that
hes
got
it
in
his
mind
that
he
wants
to
swing
away
but
rather
that
hes
still
a
total
sucker
for
the
curve
ball
it
looked
for
a
while
in
that
he
was
getting
better
but
its
still
his
weak
point
as
to
whether
it
does
him
any
good
to
have
bonds
behind
him
the
netstatmavens
will
probably
tell
you
theres
no
reason
that
it
should
but
if
he
thinks
it
will
it
might
be
a
selffulfilling
prophecy
as
to
whether
the
giants
lineup
is
optimal
who
knows
batting
bonds
the
teams
best
hitter
fifth
does
seem
to
be
odd
but
the
and
hitters
arent
exactly
messrs
oba
so
they
arent
giving
much
up
there
and
although
clark
isnt
the
overall
offensive
force
that
bonds
is
he
seems
better
suited
to
the
spot
assuming
of
course
that
he
starts
hitting
one
of
these
days
