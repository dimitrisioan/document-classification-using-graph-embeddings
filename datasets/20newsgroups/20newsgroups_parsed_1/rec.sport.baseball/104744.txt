re
game
length
was
re
braves
update
umpires
are
not
required
to
call
time
out
just
because
a
player
asks
for
time
only
in
extreme
cases
like
dust
in
the
pitchers
or
hitters
eyes
should
an
umpire
call
time
the
batter
has
seconds
to
get
situated
in
the
box
and
receive
a
pitch
im
against
putting
a
giant
clock
or
any
size
clock
for
that
matter
up
to
count
down
seconds
between
pitches
and
the
minute
for
warmups
but
i
think
umpires
should
tell
hitters
to
go
to
hell
if
they
step
out
to
get
the
sign
or
whatever
and
instruct
the
pitcher
to
pitch
the
same
goes
for
pitchers
umps
should
tell
them
to
pitch
or
feint
within
seconds
or
a
ball
will
be
called
thats
the
way
it
should
be
