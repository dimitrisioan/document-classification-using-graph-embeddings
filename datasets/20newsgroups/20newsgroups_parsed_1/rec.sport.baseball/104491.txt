hey
all
you
yankee
fans
whove
been
knocking
my
prediction
of
baltimore
um
how
many
games
have
the
orioles
won
you
flooded
my
mailbox
with
cries
of
militellos
good
militellos
good
he
is
or
will
be
where
is
he
i
noticed
he
got
skipped
over
after
that
oh
so
strong
first
outing
hes
not
by
any
chance
in
columbus
now
is
he
please
dont
tell
me
youre
relying
on
this
guy
to
be
the
fourth
not
the
fifth
but
the
fourth
starter
on
this
brittle
pitching
staff
no
currently
theres
no
room
for
him
in
the
rotation
key
is
having
a
most
impressive
april
abbott
is
pitching
well
perez
is
back
wickman
has
pitched
his
way
into
the
rotation
and
is
holding
his
spot
with
an
outstanding
performance
his
last
time
out
and
kamieniecki
isnt
doing
too
poorly
himself
if
the
yankees
find
themselves
in
need
of
a
starter
militello
will
get
another
chance
until
then
hell
have
to
wait
in
line
