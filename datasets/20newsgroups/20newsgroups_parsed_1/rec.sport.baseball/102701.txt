speaking
of
the
marlins
winning
the
opener
based
on
lifetime
percentage
of
games
won
who
has
the
second
best
record
in
baseball
history
soon
to
be
the
best
record
again
if
i
had
to
guess
i
would
be
forced
to
say
the
yankees
on
the
other
hand
the
blue
jays
might
be
up
there
too
hmmmmm
tony
blue
jays
no
way
hell
but
the
yankees
probably
do
remember
the
yankees
had
the
best
record
of
any
team
in
the
s
and
probably
take
the
s
through
s
