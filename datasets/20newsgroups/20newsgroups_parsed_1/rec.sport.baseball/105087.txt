subject
braves
stoppers
the
term
stopper
is
generally
used
to
refer
to
a
pitcher
one
who
can
be
counted
on
to
pitch
a
strong
game
to
keep
his
team
from
going
on
a
losing
streak
the
braves
have
plenty
of
pitchers
to
fit
this
description
although
right
now
id
expect
smoltz
or
glavine
to
take
the
mantle
what
the
braves
lack
however
is
an
offensive
stopper
somebody
they
can
look
to
to
bring
them
out
of
their
hitting
slump
theres
just
no
one
there
the
braves
got
rid
of
their
best
pure
hitter
lonnie
smith
and
only
terry
pendleton
on
the
current
roster
has
ever
shown
more
than
a
cursory
ability
to
hit
oh
and
another
thing
that
worries
me
ron
gant
seems
to
have
slowed
down
a
step
thats
scary
a
slow
ron
gant
doesnt
have
much
going
for
him
