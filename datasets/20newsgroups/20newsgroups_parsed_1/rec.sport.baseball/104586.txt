rbis
and
runs
scored
are
the
two
most
important
offensive
statistics
actually
theyre
pretty
worthless
if
you
want
to
evaluate
players
with
stats
rbis
and
runs
scored
should
be
banned
all
they
do
is
confuse
victims
of
mediot
brainwashing
like
yourself
you
can
talk
about
obp
and
slg
all
you
want
but
the
fact
remains
the
team
that
scores
more
runs
wins
the
game
uh
so
youve
just
explained
why
we
use
obp
and
slg
to
evaluate
players
precisely
because
the
team
that
scores
more
runs
wins
the
game
traditional
baseball
stats
have
gotten
way
too
far
away
from
methods
which
enable
fans
to
see
who
contributes
to
those
runs
scored
thats
where
obp
slg
runs
created
linear
weights
etc
come
in
these
simplify
matters
so
that
we
can
more
easily
measure
a
players
offensive
contribution
to
the
teams
runs
scored
thank
you
for
making
our
case
have
a
nice
day
