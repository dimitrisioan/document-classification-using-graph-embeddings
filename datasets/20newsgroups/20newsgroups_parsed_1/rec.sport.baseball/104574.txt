does
anybody
in

know
why
mike
lavalliere
was
released
last
year
i
kept
saying
that
slaught
should
get
the
bulk
of
the
playing
time
that
he
was
clearly
the
better
player
at
this
point
but
leyland
insisted
on
keeping
a
pretty
strict
platoon
and
now
he
is
released
that
doesnt
make
any
sense
to
me
greg
the
story
goes
like
this
spanky
is
too
slow
if
he
were
quicker
he
would
still
be
here
but
with
slaught
and
tom
prince
they
didnt
want
to
lose
prince
in
order
to
bring
up
that
th
pitcher
slaught
is
about
as
good
as
spanky
and
prince
is
coming
along
nicely
dont
feel
too
bad
for
him
hes
still
gon
na
get
theat
over
the
next
two
