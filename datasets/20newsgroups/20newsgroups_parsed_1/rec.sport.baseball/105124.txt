the
best
home
run
i
have
ever
seen
came
off
believe
it
or
not
roger
clemens
sorry
val
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
threw
a
ball
to
incaviglia
which
was
literally
at
inkys
neck
and
he
absolutely
hammered
the
crap
out
of
it
after
the
swing
clemens
nonchalantly
motioned
for
a
new
ballhe
didnt
even
turn
around
to
look
or
even
get
upset
the
ball
hit
the
lights
in
the
leftfield
standard
some
or
so
feet
about
the
green
monster
over
feet
above
the
ground
total
truly
an
amazing
shot
i
was
at
that
game
behind
home
plate
next
to
a
scout
who
was
manning
the
radar
gun
the
season
was
winding
down
and
roger
didnt
have
his
best
fastball
topping
out
at
in
contrast
to
frank
tanana
who
went
as
low
as
with
one
lollipop
in
the
process
of
striking
out
phil
plantier
five
times
on
the
night
inkys
shot
would
have
gone
further
than
any
ive
ever
seen
if
it
hadnt
crashed
into
the
lights
not
the
lightstand
as
you
say
over
feet
high
roy
hobbslike
and
bounced
back
onto
the
field
that
had
to
have
been
a
footer
if
unobstructed
edging
out
bo
jacksons
drive
off

can
boyd
to
the
top
of
the
centerfield
