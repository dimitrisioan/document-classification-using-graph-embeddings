brian
kiviat
says
what
i
think
is
hotdogish
about
his
abs
is
the
way
he
leans
out
over
the
plate
to
watch
outside
pitches
etc
this
not
done
to
get
a
better
look
at
the
pitch
but
to
make
it
seemthis
ball
is
so
far
out
i
need
to
lean
just
to
get
near
it
so
you
better
call
it
a
ball
this
is
my
unbiased
opinion
of
what
i
see
your
mileage
will
vary
rickey
is
agreat
player
to
watch
if
you
forget
who
he
is
at
the
time
a
lot
of
batters
lean
in
when
pitches
come
rickeys
crouch
tends
to
exaggerate
that
i
think
a
great
player
to
watch
if
you
forget
who
he
is
unbiased
