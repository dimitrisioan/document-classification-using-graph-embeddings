players
overpaid
theres
a
lot
of
whining
about
how
much
players
are
overpaid
i
thought
id
put
together
an
underpaid
team
that
could
win
a
pennant
i
splurged
and
let
four
of
the
players
earn
as
much
as
half
a
million
dollars
the
highestpaid
player
is
frank
thomas
at
k
i
cut
some
players
like
kenny
lofton
chris
hoiles
keith
mitchell
tim
wakefield
and
a
bunch
of
pitchers
all
of
whom
could
have
arguably
made
the
team
better
at
a
cost
of
million
for
the
lot
of
them
the
total
team
salary
is
averaging
slightly
over
k
a
player
if
thats
too
steep
you
can
dump
thomas
and
bagwell
replacing
them
with
paul
sorrento
and
a
minimum
wager
to
save
a
bit
over
a
million
dollars
and
still
have
one
of
the
best
teams
in
the
majors
