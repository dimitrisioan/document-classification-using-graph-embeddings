for
predicting
the
future
it
has
been
entirely
meaningless
at
least
if
it
has
meaning
we
dont
know
how
to
find
it
i
did
not
say
i
could
predict
the
future
you
most
certainly
did
i
really
dont
want
to
get
into
a
didsodidnot
debate
with
you
but
this
is
somewhat
at
the
heart
of
our
disagreement
i
did
not
say
nor
did
i
imply
that
i
could
predict
the
future
you
have
inferred
that
my
comments
meant
this
and
you
have
based
your
rebuttal
of
my
comments
on
the
fact
that
statistical
studies
have
demonstrated
that
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
for
predicting
future
performance
in
regard
to
clutch
hitting
sabo
samuel
sabo
is
clearly
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
yet
you
would
pinchhit
samuel
because
you
predict
that
samuel
will
be
a
clutch
hitter
and
sabo
will
be
a
choke
hitter
right
id
call
that
predicting
the
future
that
is
your
opinion
that
sabo
is
clearly
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
the
above
data
is
for
a
year
period
ending
last
season
last
season
samuel
batted
while
sabo
hit
not
park
adjusted
this
season
they
are
both
hitting
below
albeit
sabo
with
more
at
bats
i
will
agree
that
over
his
career
sabo
has
been
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
but
i
will
also
remind
you
that
samuel
has
been
a
better
hitter
in
certain
situations
than
sabo
i
did
not
predict
that
sabo
would
choke
nor
that
samuel
would
get
a
hit
i
expressed
my
opinion
that
had
i
been
the
reds
manager
or
even
a
reds
fan
that
i
would
prefer
to
have
samuel
hit
in
that
situation
than
sabo
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
reds
manager
at
that
time
i
assume
you
would
have
had
some
basis
for
letting
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hitting
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basis
would
have
utilized
prior
performance
you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular
aspect
of
prior
performance
is
this
not
correct
right
i
would
have
used
aspects
of
prior
performance
which
have
been
shown
to
be
consistent
in
the
past
overall
performance
lr
splits
even
matching
hittingpitching
styles
all
of
these
will
give
me
some
advantage
if
used
properly
ah
properly
yes
i
see
even
if
all
else
were
equal
there
would
be
no
advantage
gained
by
looking
at
past
clutch
performance
and
in
this
case
everything
else
pointed
to
sabo
please
help
me
what
exactly
is
everything
else
that
pointed
to
sabo
well
yes
you
are
aware
of
its
existance
you
claim
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling
yet
you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
must
say
i
was
not
aware
of
the
publication
can
you
email
me
the
information
regarding
its
availability
and
i
guess
i
must
apologize
to
all
of
those
who
have
done
extensive
study
on
say
supply
side
economics
i
didnt
mean
to
insult
you
but
i
never
did
believe
you
were
on
the
right
path
im
sorry
for
my
contrary
opinionposition
i
also
regret
that
i
dont
have
the
ability
to
prove
that
you
are
wrong
but
you
are
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
if
you
mean
the
first
then
as
you
say
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
but
the
second
is
a
much
stronger
statement
in
fact
it
suggests
a
rule
we
can
then
test
this
rule
on
past
data
to
see
if
it
worked
for
recent
years
i
think
you
will
agree
that
if
the
rule
didnt
work
last
year
or
the
year
before
that
it
is
unlikely
to
do
any
better
this
year
right
the
second
is
your
statement
not
mine
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
well
actually
i
havent
yet
but
im
not
finished
looking
that
is
i
havent
yet
found
someone
who
hit
significantly
below
his
overall
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
for
the
years
and
then
reversed
that
relationship
in
gamblers
fallacy
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consistency
a
run
proves
nothing
can
you
give
us
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detailed
study
of
why
i
shouldnt
expect
it
to
correlate
nope
sorry
but
if
you
were
interested
in
a
reason
why
i
expect
chris
sabos
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
if
you
were
interested
in
a
reason
why
i
expect
joe
carters
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
but
youre
not
interested
in
that
because
you
think
that
those
conclusions
could
only
be
valid
if
they
could
be
extrapolated
over
the
entire
baseball
population
and
they
cant
be
the
stupid
was
in
reference
to
a
statement
which
was
stupid
and
i
dont
see
how
you
can
deny
it
as
for
total
idiot
yes
if
you
prove
yourself
unwilling
to
even
consider
evidence
that
might
suggest
that
you
are
wrong
i
would
say
the
term
fits
nicely
the
problem
here
is
that
i
do
believe
you
i
accept
your
work
i
believe
that
trying
to
predict
future
clutch
performance
based
on
prior
clutch
history
is
meaningless
no
better
than
a
coin
toss
i
actually
do
accept
your
work
as
it
happens
i
also
have
an
opinion
that
in
certain
situations
for
certain
players
a
history
of
superior
or
inferior
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
might
suggest
a
reason
what
such
history
could
be
valid
in
projecting
future
player
performance
for
that
player
and
chris
sabo
is
one
such
player
so
tell
me
does
the
term
fit
or
do
you
have
an
open
mind
well
since
i
defer
to
your
statistical
wisdom
i
think
i
must
have
an
open
mind
now
we
have
to
pose
the
same
question
to
you
