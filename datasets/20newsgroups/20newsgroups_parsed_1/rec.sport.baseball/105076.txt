writes
ugliest
stance
of
all
time
has
to
go
to
oscar
gamble
the
man
would
practically
kneel
in
front
of
home
plate
in
order
to
have
a
small
strike
zone
hes
just
lucky
that
strike
zone
size
isnt
determined
by
how
big
your
afro
is
i
agree
however
i
have
to
object
growing
up
in
the
early
s
and
playing
years
of
mario
mendozaesque
little
league
i
was
told
that
since
my
hitting
well
sucked
i
would
do
best
to
either
walk
or
take
one
in
the
face
for
the
team
i
did
both
and
my
yankee
fan
father
would
say
bat
like
oscar
gamble
so
i
did
and
my
career
obp
was
about
not
only
was
oscar
a
fun
guy
to
watch
but
he
had
some
pretty
cool
baseball
cards
and
helped
me
become
one
of
the
best
little
league
players
in
history
im
outta
here
like

jason
