re
jim
lefebvre
is
an
idiot
i
totally
agree
with
each
point
you
made
jose
viscaino
looked
like
a
single
a
hitter
up
there
who
swings
on
count
with
maddux
pitching
and
your
teams
down
by
a
run
and
you
havent
touched
the
ball
all
day
i
also
think
too
much
is
made
of
that
leftyrighty
thing
watching
the
cubs
games
i
get
the
feeling
steve
stone
knows
a
lot
more
about
what
the
cubs
should
be
doing
than
lefebre
does
harry
said
it
best
when
he
stated
after
another
terrible
vizcaino
at
bat
we
cant
wait
til
sandberg
returns
