the
royals
are
darkness
they
are
the
void
of
our
time
when
they
play
shame
descends
upon
the
land
like
a
cold
front
from
canada
they
are
a
humiliation
to
all
who
have
lived
and
all
who
shall
ever
live
they
are
utterly
and
completely
doomed
other
than
that
i
guess
theyre
ok
oh
lighten
up
what
depresses
me
is
that
they
might
actually
finish
last
which
i
believe
hasnt
happened
since
their
second
season
in
never
mind
that
gubizca
is
with
a
era
gardner
at
our
main
recent
acquisitions
lind
mcreynolds
jose
are
averaging
david
cone
is
about
how
he
was
doing
in
kc
before
joining
the
mets
several
years
ago
our
hitting
sucks
and
our
pitching
has
collapsed
and
weve
won
one
game
at
home
theyve
won
more
games
in
their
first
ten
games
than
last
year
and
brian
mcrae
is
actually
batting
over
the
mendoza
line
