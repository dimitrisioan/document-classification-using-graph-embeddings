sigh
here
we
go
again
you
started
it
for
predicting
the
future
it
has
been
entirely
meaningless
at
least
if
it
has
meaning
we
dont
know
how
to
find
it
i
did
not
say
i
could
predict
the
future
you
most
certainly
did
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
sabo
samuel
sabo
is
clearly
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
yet
you
would
pinchhit
samuel
because
you
predict
that
samuel
will
be
a
clutch
hitter
and
sabo
will
be
a
choke
hitter
right
id
call
that
predicting
the
future
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
reds
manager
at
that
time
i
assume
you
would
have
had
some
basis
for
letting
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hitting
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basis
would
have
utilized
prior
performance
you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular
aspect
of
prior
performance
is
this
not
correct
right
i
would
have
used
aspects
of
prior
performance
which
have
been
shown
to
be
consistent
in
the
past
overall
performance
lr
splits
even
matching
hittingpitching
styles
all
of
these
will
give
me
some
advantage
if
used
properly
even
if
all
else
were
equal
there
would
be
no
advantage
gained
by
looking
at
past
clutch
performance
and
in
this
case
everything
else
pointed
to
sabo
one
more
time
i
did
not
claim
to
be
able
to
predict
the
future
i
said
that
i
accept
the
above
data
as
an
indication
that
samuel
would
have
had
a
better
chance
for
success
in
that
situation
than
sabo
that
comes
down
to
the
same
thing
when
perez
left
sabo
in
he
was
predicting
the
future
the
next
ab
he
was
predicting
that
sabo
was
more
likely
to
get
a
hit
than
samuel
by
supporting
the
swap
you
are
predicting
the
opposite
and
i
am
not
dismissing
your
work
im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your
work
well
yes
you
are
aware
of
its
existance
you
claim
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling
yet
you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consistent
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indicator
of
performance
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
right
this
is
the
beef
it
has
not
proven
to
be
an
indicator
of
future
performance
under
any
circumstances
at
least
none
that
weve
been
able
to
come
up
with
if
you
know
of
some
where
it
is
an
indicator
of
future
performance
please
let
us
in
on
your
secret
it
is
nice
however
to
see
that
you
will
consider
the
possibility
that
you
actually
could
have
some
preconceived
biases
most
certainly
as
i
have
repeatedly
stated
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
study
which
even
hints
at
a
consistent
clutch
ability
i
would
love
it
however
the
straightforward
attempts
at
such
a
study
have
all
failed
miserably
yeah
hindsight
is
always
doesnt
that
make
you
bright
this
is
a
stupid
argument
and
you
know
it
ah
i
knew
we
could
get
to
the
name
calling
and
theres
that
word
you
like
so
much
well
it
was
a
stupid
argument
are
you
honestly
debating
that
sure
we
know
sabo
didnt
get
a
hit
we
have
no
idea
whether
samuel
would
have
done
any
better
or
not
one
ab
most
certainly
doesnt
prove
anything
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
if
you
mean
the
first
then
as
you
say
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
but
the
second
is
a
much
stronger
statement
in
fact
it
suggests
a
rule
we
can
then
test
this
rule
on
past
data
to
see
if
it
worked
for
recent
years
i
think
you
will
agree
that
if
the
rule
didnt
work
last
year
or
the
year
before
that
it
is
unlikely
to
do
any
better
this
year
right
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
was
significantly
below
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
each
year
i
presume
you
think
this
is
random
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
no
this
doesnt
prove
any
overall
statistical
trend
that
can
be
used
to
predict
future
performance
across
the
breadth
of
major
league
ballplayers
it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
the
clutch
is
not
going
to
be
as
high
as
his
ba
in
nonclutch
situations
gamblers
fallacy
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consistency
a
run
proves
nothing
can
you
give
us
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detailed
study
of
why
i
shouldnt
expect
it
to
correlate
stupid
total
idiot
my
my
such
hostility
the
stupid
was
in
reference
to
a
statement
which
was
stupid
and
i
dont
see
how
you
can
deny
it
as
for
total
idiot
yes
if
you
prove
yourself
unwilling
to
even
consider
evidence
that
might
suggest
that
you
are
wrong
i
would
say
the
term
fits
nicely
so
tell
me
does
the
term
fit
or
do
you
have
an
open
mind
