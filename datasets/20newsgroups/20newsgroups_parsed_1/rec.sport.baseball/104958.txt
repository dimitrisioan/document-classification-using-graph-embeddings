sigh
here
we
go
again
actually
several
scdns
stated
that
there
were
no
definable
skills
that
would
make
a
hitter
more
likely
to
perform
better
in
clutch
situations
vs
nonclutch
situations
however
one
might
choose
to
define
clutch
right
can
you
define
such
a
skill
must
i
if
i
were
to
say
that
batting
average
is
a
predictor
that
can
be
used
to
judge
which
of
two
hitters
is
more
likely
to
get
a
hit
on
a
particular
plate
appearance
is
that
only
valid
if
i
can
define
the
skill
in
hitting
a
baseball
thats
all
ive
said
except
i
used
the
smaller
sample
of
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
and
elsewhere
on
this
thread
sherri
nichols
repeats
her
position
that
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
is
a
meaningless
statistic
for
predicting
the
future
it
has
been
entirely
meaningless
at
least
if
it
has
meaning
we
dont
know
how
to
find
it
i
did
not
say
i
could
predict
the
future
ive
suggested
that
the
statistic
is
not
necessarily
meaningless
heres
the
data
for
this
situation
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
sabo
samuel
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
reds
manager
at
that
time
i
assume
you
would
have
had
some
basis
for
letting
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hitting
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basis
would
have
utilized
prior
performance
you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular
aspect
of
prior
performance
is
this
not
correct
ill
try
to
avoid
being
insulting
but
its
difficult
when
you
so
cavalierly
dismiss
hundreds
of
hours
of
work
with
an
i
dont
pretend
to
understand
but
nobody
is
denying
that
there
are
people
who
have
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
past
but
i
challenge
you
to
find
a
method
to
predict
who
will
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
future
which
after
all
is
what
you
are
claiming
you
can
do
since
one
more
time
i
did
not
claim
to
be
able
to
predict
the
future
i
said
that
i
accept
the
above
data
as
an
indication
that
samuel
would
have
had
a
better
chance
for
success
in
that
situation
than
sabo
and
i
am
not
dismissing
your
work
im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your
work
fine
we
have
plenty
of
data
obviously
our
preconceived
biases
must
be
coloring
our
work
since
you
know
clutch
hitting
is
a
welldefined
and
consistent
skill
all
of
our
failures
notwithstanding
so
i
challenge
you
to
prove
it
i
guarantee
you
that
if
you
can
prove
the
existance
of
some
form
of
clutch
ability
you
will
have
plenty
of
happy
sdcns
dancing
around
you
i
did
not
say
that
clutchhitting
is
well
defined
i
said
that
the
data
is
significant
to
me
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consistent
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indicator
of
performance
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
but
you
arent
going
to
win
any
support
by
merely
stating
a
position
and
claiming
they
are
stupid
so
i
must
be
right
and
big
sigh
i
have
not
not
not
not
not
not
not
ever
called
you
or
anyone
else
on
rsb
stupid
it
is
nice
however
to
see
that
you
will
consider
the
possibility
that
you
actually
could
have
some
preconceived
biases
yeah
hindsight
is
always
doesnt
that
make
you
bright
this
is
a
stupid
argument
and
you
know
it
ah
i
knew
we
could
get
to
the
name
calling
and
theres
that
word
you
like
so
much
a
suggestion
take
data
from
and
attempt
to
come
up
with
some
method
that
predicts
who
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
if
that
works
we
can
then
attempt
to
apply
it
to
and
beyond
wait
a
minute
i
thought
i
first
had
to
define
clutch
hitting
do
i
or
dont
i
you
have
made
strong
statements
now
back
them
up
or
be
proven
a
total
idiot
i
made
two
statements
in
my
post
i
am
not
convinced
of
your
conclusions
regarding
clutch
hitting
i
would
have
hit
for
sabo
as
for
many
of
us
make
a
number
of
written
statements
through
this
media
about
what
we
think
will
happen
in
baseball
im
not
shy
about
it
ill
make
the
statement
again
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
was
significantly
below
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
each
year
i
presume
you
think
this
is
random
nonclutch
ab
h
clutch
ab
h
so
what
could
we
expect
in
from
mr
carter
well
his
composite
ba
through
was
through
was
through
was
so
i
think
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
kind
of
batting
average
he
can
produce
in
he
hit
not
surprising
huh
also
in
nonclutch
ab
h
clutch
ab
h
no
this
doesnt
prove
any
overall
statistical
trend
that
can
be
used
to
predict
future
performance
across
the
breadth
of
major
league
ballplayers
it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
the
clutch
is
not
going
to
be
as
high
as
his
ba
in
nonclutch
situations
as
for
above
i
have
plenty
of
company
john
dewan
of
statsinc
is
the
editor
of
the
scouting
report
wherein
the
statistics
regarding
clutch
hitting
are
compiled
reported
and
referenced
in
the
text
bill
james
makes
numerous
references
to
a
players
ability
to
hit
well
in
the
clutch
i
am
not
saying
that
i
can
predict
the
future
any
more
than
they
are
you
and
others
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
their
statements
and
mine
meaningless
i
dont
accept
that
which
in
your
words
proves
that
i
am
a
total
idiot
stupid
total
idiot
my
my
such
hostility
