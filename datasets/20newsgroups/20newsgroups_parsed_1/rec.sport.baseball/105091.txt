what
is
the
maximum
runs
allowed
before
a
stopper
can
get
credit
for
a
relief
ie
if
a
stopper
comes
in
with
a
run
lead
does
he
getcredit
with
the
save
if
you
come
in
and
pitch
the
last
three
inningsand
your
team
was
ahead
when
you
got
out
there
and
wins
the
game
you
get
a
save
sorta
correct
if
you
pitched
at
least
inningsentered
with
your
team
in
the
lead
was
the
pitcher
when
the
game
endedthe
game
was
never
tied
during
your
stint
and
your
team
won
you
get
a
save
well
the
rulebook
says
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
scorer
you
must
have
pitched
effectively
for
your
innings
this
save
is
not
automatic
unlike
the
others
someone
in
sabr
actually
looked
at
these
games
a
few
years
ago
and
found
that
the
official
scorer
awarded
the
save
in
every
one
of
the
games
even
those
in
which
the
pitcher
had
pitched
badly
allowing
or
runs
seeing
hearing
my
two
