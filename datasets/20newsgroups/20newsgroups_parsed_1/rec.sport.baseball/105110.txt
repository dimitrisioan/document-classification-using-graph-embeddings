did
you
see
the
same
game
i
saw
gant
most
reasonable
argued
a
horrible
call
which
hirschbeck
correctly
did
nothing
about
gant
then
proceeded
to
walk
halfway
to
rd
base
lean
on
his
bat
and
glare
at
hirschbeck
while
i
dont
necessasarily
subscribe
to
the
theory
of
showing
people
up
this
was
an
obvious
attempt
by
gant
to
do
so
to
hirschbeck
he
left
hirschbeck
no
choice
but
to
take
control
of
the
situation
the
bottom
line
is
gant
started
a
dangerous
power
struggle
with
hirschbeck
when
his
team
needed
him
most
and
he
lost
the
events
i
saw
were
called
strike
by
hirschbeck
was
it
just
me
or
did
it
look
like
hirschbeck
pointed
to
the
b
umpire
before
calling
that
strike
i
thought
thats
why
gant
was
asking
for
the
appeal
to
the
st
base
umpire
he
thought
hirschbeck
had
gotten
checkedswing
help
from
the
wrong
umpire
shockedlooking
gant
asks
for
appeal
to
first
no
appeal
to
first
gant
steps
out
of
batters
box
hirschbeck
immediately
orders
gant
back
in
bad
move
gant
ignores
hirschbeck
and
walks
off
bad
move
hirschbeck
yells
at
gant
gant
is
silent
hirschbeck
calls
for
the
pitch
after
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
but
before
the
pitch
was
thrown
cox
came
onto
the
field
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
trying
to
get
time
called
before
the
pitch
but
no
one
was
watching
pitch
is
called
a
strike
cox
argues
couldnt
see
when
he
came
on
the
field
cox
is
ejected
players
everywhere
play
finally
resumes
gant
shouldnt
have
ignored
hirschbeck
not
returning
made
the
strike
call
fairly
likely
although
i
suspect
an
argument
might
have
gotten
gant
tossed
altogether
but
if
hirschbeck
had
let
gant
step
out
the
whole
incident
probably
would
have
been
avoided
your
listing
pretty
much
agreed
with
what
i
saw
with
the
aforementioned
addendums
perhaps
it
appeared
differently
at
the
ballpark
personally
i
was
amazed
that
gant
didnt
get
ejected
but
thats
why
cox
did
its
called
protecting
your
players
and
to
those
people
who
would
have
thrown
everyone
out
of
the
game
all
i
can
say
is
that
youd
be
making
baseball
history
even
in
the
worst
baseball
brawls
usually
only
the
major
instigators
are
ejected
not
everyone
who
comes
onto
the
field
and
id
have
to
say
that
those
brawls
are
considerably
more
threatening
to
the
game
than
what
the
braves
did
fri
night
anyhow
thats
my
last
two
cents
on
the
subject
barring
outrageous
postings
i
will
try
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
more
incidents
involving
hirschbeck
i
think
there
will
be
some
with
other
teams
as
well
i
hope
not
