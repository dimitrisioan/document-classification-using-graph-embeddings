here
is
where
you
are
obviously
dead
wrong
not
since
the
yankees
of
the
s
and
s
has
a
team
been
so
nicely
setup
as
this
yearsand
years
to
come
braves
i
dont
think
that
the
allstar
team
will
be
able
to
beat
this
may
be
an
appropriate
comparison
the
yankees
finshed
nd
rd
and
nd
finshing
and
games
out
of
first
in
and
they
also
finished
second
though
they
were
only
and
games
out
even
great
teams
can
lose
thats
why
they
play
the
season
on
the
other
hand
im
still
picking
the
braves
to
go
all
the
way
um
surely
you
didnt
intend
to
compare
the
reds
with
the
philidelphia
as
the
yankees
were
finishing
nd
to
a
team
that
was
as
good
as
the
yankees
while
the
yankees
had
aged
some
from
their
peak
years
ruth
and
gehrig
couldnt
play
every
position
simultaneously
imo
given
the
various
ages
of
the
braves
and
reds
this
season
that
the
braves
will
be
closer
to
their
peak
while
the
reds
have
slightly
passed
their
peak
also
if
youre
going
to
compare
braves
and
yankees
a
more
appropriate
comparison
to
the
braves
might
be
the
yankees
after
falling
short
two
years
in
a
row
in
exciting
world
series
both
teams
wonwill
win
the
series
this
year
despite
the
heroics
of
some
old
fart
on
the
other
