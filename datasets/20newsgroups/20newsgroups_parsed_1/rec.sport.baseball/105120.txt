info
please
hi
there
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
knew
if
john
wetteland
was
put
on
the
dl
again
after
his
first
day
period
was
up
i
read
in
the
usa
today
sports
section
that
he
is
on
for
surgery
to
repair
broken
toe
and
was
wondering
if
that
was
new
i
thought
he
was
just
letting
it
heal
another
question
is
derek
lilliquist
the
main
closer
for
the
indians
now
that
olin
is
gone
i
need
to
know
cause
i
need
to
find
a
reliever
to
replace
wetteland
and
so
far
lilliquist
is
doing
ok
any
information
on
either
of
the
players
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thank
you
for
your
time
