redreport
tim
belcher
pitched
a
dandy
threehit
shutout
tonight
as
cincinnati
won
their
second
straight
pittsburgh
lefty
randy
tomlin
was
hit
early
and
often
by
the
heavily
rightunbalanced
reds
lineup
which
managed
some
recently
rare
power
with
their
bats
belcher
was
solid
throughout
and
in
fact
seemed
to
get
stronger
as
the
game
progressed
early
on
he
had
several
threeball
counts
but
even
those
were
few
and
far
between
later
on
as
he
allowed
only
one
baseonballs
while
striking
out
nine
in
a
post
game
interview
he
said
his
changeup
was
working
for
himi
should
say
so
all
nine
of
his
strikeouts
were
apparently
on
breaking
balls
tomlin
on
the
other
hand
was
in
trouble
early
giving
up
a
secondpitch
double
to
leadoff
batter
bip
roberts
bobby
kelly
followed
with
a
single
and
barry
larkin
scored
roberts
with
a
sharp
single
to
right
the
big
guys
mitchell
sabo
milligan
were
unable
to
get
anything
after
thatin
fact
they
all
struck
outbut
kelly
managed
a
score
anyway
due
to
a
doublesteal
and
a
tomlin
wild
pitch
in
fact
it
appeared
that
tomlin
was
going
to
recover
nicely
from
his
shaky
start
he
retired
of
the
next
batters
to
get
to
the
fourth
behind
only
randy
milligan
though
had
different
ideas
as
his
lineshot
was
poorly
played
by
orlando
merced
and
turned
into
a
triple
milligan
would
later
score
on
reggie
sanders
sacrifice
fly
giving
cinci
the
lead
after
the
fifth
inning
spelled
loss
for
tomlin
when
roberts
led
off
with
his
second
double
of
the
game
and
one
batter
later
larkin
smacked
a
double
down
the
left
field
line
chasing
tomlin
barry
later
would
score
the
final
run
on
tom
princes
twobase
passed
ball
the
pirates
managed
their
only
threat
of
the
day
in
the
bottom
half
of
the
fifth
when
merced
and
kevin
young
hit
backtoback
singles
the
second
being
of
the
bunt
variety
but
carlos
garcia
struck
out
prince
fit
a
foul
fly
and
pinchhitter
lonnie
smith
kd
to
end
any
pittsburgh
hope
pittsburgh
pitchers
backed
tomlin
up
well
though
relievers
blas
minor
moeller
sp
and
nagel
gave
up
only
two
hits
in
their
fourplus
innings
work
barry
larkin
left
the
game
in
the
seventh
when
the
grounder
he
misplayed
bruised
his
right
thumb
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
for
precautionary
xrays
lets
hope
hes
ok
cincinnati
is
now
still
the
worst
record
in
the
majors
but
with
the
two
wins
they
may
be
looking
at
moving
out
of
the
cellar
pittsburgh
is
now
