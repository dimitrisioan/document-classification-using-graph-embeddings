stadium
not
for
baseball
did
anyone
notice
the
words
not
for
baseball
printed
on
the
picture
of
joe
robbie
stadium
in
the
opening
day
season
preview
section
in
usa
today
any
reason
given
for
this
also
i
just
noticed
something
looking
at
the
nolan
ryan
timeline
in
the
preview
on
rickey
henderson
became
nolans
th
strikeout
on
he
pitched
his
th
nohitter
against
oakland
i
believe
the
last
out
in
the
game
was
made
by
rickey
henderson
and
on
nolan
pitched
his
th
nohitter
on
the
same
day
a
certain
someone
stole
his
th
base
which
overshadowed
it
it
seems
that
nolan
is
having
a
lot
of
publicity
at
rickeys
expense
imo
rickey
deserves
it
and
it
seems
as
most
of
the
net
agrees
with
me
from
what
ive
seen
on
it
lately
they
are
both
great
players
but
imo
nolan
has
outclassed
rickey
both
in
playing
and
more
importantly
in
attitude
just
my
thoughts
