red
sox
choke
contest
to
encourage
the
great
tradition
of
red
sox
negativism
i
am
having
a
contest
to
predict
the
magnitude
of
the
sox
fall
from
their
current
heights
you
must
decide
first
whether
the
sox
will
be
at
again
at
any
time
during
this
year
then
you
must
predict
either
their
record
the
first
time
theyre
at
if
they
are
or
their
final
record
if
they
stay
above
the
rest
of
the
year
so
valentines
earlier
prediction
would
go
as
resend
it
if
you
were
serious
val
espn
pointed
out
last
night
that
the
last
sox
start
better
than
this
was
in
when
they
finished
in
sixth
place
so
email
me
your
guess
either
at
or
directly
