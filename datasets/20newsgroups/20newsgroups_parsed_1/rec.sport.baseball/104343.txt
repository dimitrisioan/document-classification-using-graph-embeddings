old
predictions
to
laugh
at
oops
i
came
across
this
file
from
last
year
thought
you
might
enjoy
some
of
these
thoughts
the
predictions
were
made
on
the
date
indicated
they
are
largely
out
of
order
june
me
what
have
i
done
i
computed
the
expected
winning
percentage
for
each
team
from
their
obp
total
bases
and
runs
allowed
i
use
the
basic
rc
formula
and
the
pythagorean
projection
i
then
compare
this
with
their
actual
winning
percentage
all
stats
through
june
team

city

you
all
know
how
things
turned
out
the
orioles
red
sox
and
yankees
all
disappeared
the
jays
and
tigers
continued
at
essentially
the
expected
pace
the
brewers
and
indians
cranked
in
the
second
half
the
rangers
predictably
took
a
dive
that
shouldnt
have
surprised
anybody
meanwhile
as
predicted
the
mariners
dropped
behind
the
angels
and
royals
they
clearly
didnt
deserve
the
record
in
june
the
white
sox
and
as
upped
their
game
a
bit
while
the
twins
dropped
off
a
little
but
for
the
most
part
things
were
as
expected
okay
so
there
were
a
few
blatant
errors
but
for
a
predictive
calculation
i
thought
this
did
pretty
well
from
tue
mar
the
braves
insert
kent
mercker
into
the
starting
rotation
sometime
this
year
bielecki
is
traded
or
released
lei
brandt
becomes
the
fifth
starter
and
the
best
bullpen
in
baseball
has
pena
berenguer
stanton
wohlers
freeman
and
pete
smith
who
spotstarts
as
well
hm
pete
smith
made
the
rotation
instead
of
mercker
and
bielecki
wasnt
released
until
the
end
of
the
year
i
wont
comment
on
the
bullpen
jeff
reardon
blauser
wins
the
starting
shortstop
job
outright
by
the
end
of
may
bream
goes
on
the
dl
and
klesko
goes
on
a
nice
hitting
honeymoon
a
la
gregg
jefferies
in
platooning
with
hunter
mitchell
wins
the
center
field
job
a
bit
later
allstar
break
and
nixon
stays
on
as
a
valuable
pinchrunner
lonnie
is
released
unless
the
braves
find
a
taker
in
a
trade
right
on
blauser
wrong
on
bream
and
mitchell
a
bit
early
on
lonnie
as
with
bielecki
didnt
pick
sanders
did
anybody
managers
to
be
fired
this
year
in
chronological
order
fregosi
showalter
valentine
riddoch
three
of
them
went
right
showalter
is
still
around
and
likely
to
stick
it
seems
from
tue
mar
bonds
gets
traded
from
bucs
for
some
young
talent
nope
they
won
the
division
and
so
kept
him
for
a
shot
at
the
playoffs
mets
win
division
well
they
didnt
finish
last
atlanta
repeats
in
the
west
got
that
one
right
yankees
surprise
everyone
but
finish
second
behind
toronto
nope
dwight
gooden
wins
but
is
surpassed
by
saberhagen
who
wins
i
guess
this
is
why
you
picked
the
mets
to
win
huh
roger
clemens
is
injured
early
in
the
season
tsk
tsk
not
nice
to
predict
something
like
this
strawberry
fails
to
hit
even
home
runs
and
is
often
injured
due
to
dodgers
drop
out
of
race
you
got
that
right
and
my
response
from
tedward
tue
mar
hmph
can
tell
you
are
a
mets
fan
do
you
mind
if
i
make
some
counter
predictions
against
yours
they
follow
mets
come
in
third
behind
pittsburgh
and
montreal
okay
so
the
mets
finished
fifth
but
i
got
the
pirates
and
expos
right
the
yankees
offense
and
pitching
flounders
dropping
them
to
fourth
place
in
the
al
east
boston
wins
games
the
division
the
pennant
and
the
world
series
first
half
dead
on
second
half
ummm
im
a
sox
fan
go
easy
on
me
dwight
gooden
rushes
his
comeback
gets
blown
out
and
goes
on
the
dl
from
may
through
midjuly
saberhagen
runs
a
record
wfan
criticizes
the
mets
for
giving
away
that
great
talent
jefferies
who
has
a
solid
year
in
kc
so
i
got
my
predictions
for
gooden
and
saberhagen
reversed
i
was
at
least
close
and
was
right
about
jefferies
though
i
dont
know
has
wfan
criticized
the
jefferies
trade
roger
clemens
wins
another

something
is

with

some
predictions
need
no
introduction
from
mon
apr
from
do
you
care
to
put
your
prediction
down
for
posterity
you
predict
mark
grace
will
get
rbis
i
say
you
are
out
of
your
mind
that
is
almost
impossible
for
a
hr
type
guy
batting
behind
dawson
who
kills
most
of
the
rallies
he
doesnt
finish
why
do
you
say
that
mark
has
driven
in
and
last
year
mark
was
batting
second
primarily
and
it
was
his
worse
year
average
wise
since
he
is
batting
either
rd
or
th
this
year
i
predict
he
will
be
back
up
to
his
previous
standards
i
think
he
will
be
better
rbis
is
not
that
much
of
a
stretch
sometimes
us
statheads
get
lucky
grace
didnt
hit
behind
dawson
the
entire
season
but
he
also
finished
with
only
rbis
from
tue
may
the
most
ballsy
prediction
ever
mark
mcgwire
will
hit
or
more
hrs
this
year
nope
he
slowed
down
and
the
injury
finished
him
off
didnt
even
reach
but
a
ballsy
prediction
nonetheless
from
thu
may
baltimore
will
not
fade
they
will
not
win
the
division
this
year
but
they
will
finish
within
five
games
i
find
the
prospect
of
two
orioles
winning
each
easier
to
comprehend
than
that
of
two
sox
no
offense
i
think
their
pitching
is
about
as
good
as
the
division
has
to
offer
the
orioles
finished
seven
games
out
none
of
them
won
though
mussina
might
have
had
a
chance
with
better
relief
and
more
starts
nobody
else
in
the
division
is
worth
a
darn
they
all
finish
a
minimum
of
fifteen
games
out
the
tribe
thats
another
reason
to
watch
baltimore
this
year
and
next
they
wont
waste
many
of
those
games
against
the
rest
of
the
division
except
for
the
brewers
who
you
probably
forgot
you
were
right
the
rest
of
the
division
was
thoroughly
mediocre
the
yankees
and
indians
led
with
wins
the
red
sox
trailed
with
wins
none
were
horrible
but
four
were
five
or
more
games
below
from
david
johnson
date
thu
aug
gmt
right
that
was
me
i
never
said
the
jays
were
a
cinch
to
clinch
it
but
i
said
that
milwaukee
will
be
more
of
a
threat
than
baltimore
i
do
think
that
toronto
should
win
it
but
after
i
dont
consider
anything
a
cinch
unless
you
have
something
like
a
game
lead
with
games
to
go
i
do
think
that
the
jays
have
the
best
talented
team
in
the
al
east
and
if
we
had
a
good
or
even
average
manager
we
might
have
a
bigger
lead
right
now
i
also
think
that
the
orioles
will
not
play
much
better
than
baseball
for
the
rest
of
the
season
you
win
from
thu
nov
in
article
you
write
indians
the
first
and
only
season
ever
prediction
the
cleveland
indians
will
win
or
more
games
next
year
you
were
right
from
fri
sep
jose
rijo
will
win
the
cy
young
award
if
he
is
healthy
enough
to
go
at
least
ip
who
would
have
thought
he
would
try
to
steal
a
base
why
risk
such
an
injury
he
had
ip
but
didnt
win
the
cy
young
maddux
surprised
all
the
orioles
will
win
games
in
at
least
of
the
next
years
probably
the
last
and
their
pitching
staff
will
have
a
team
era
among
the
best
in
the
al
in
at
least
of
the
next
years
but
not
necessarily
all
the
same
years
as
they
win
this
one
will
take
a
long
time
to
verify
i
dont
think
i
want
to
wait
that
long
but
they
won
games
last
year
and
they
were
fifth
in
the
league
in
era
not
a
bad
start
ben
mcdonald
will
not
challenge
for
an
era
title
in
the
next
years
nor
will
he
have
victories
either
year
by
challenge
i
mean
finish
among
the
leaders
being
among
the
leaders
before
the
season
is
done
doesnt
count
he
will
probably
never
be
the
pitcher
he
was
hyped
to
be
but
is
still
a
decent
starter
to
have
looks
like
it
he
wasnt
bad
last
year
just
too
consistent
to
be
an
ace
so
far
this
year
looks
like
more
of
the
same
the
phillies
will
give
up
many
fewer
walks
ifwhen
they
get
rid
of
their
bullpen
coach
ryan
i
am
not
predicting
when
or
whether
they
will
get
rid
of
him
and
you
will
have
to
give
the
team
a
little
bit
of
time
to
adjust
before
seeing
the
radical
change
they
would
have
a
fine
pitching
staff
if
they
would
just
steal
ray
miller
away
from
pittsburg
the
white
sox
seem
to
have
the
same
problem
but
not
as
bad
i
honestly
cant
say
did
they
get
rid
of
him
their
bb
totals
were
down
last
year
ricky
jordan
will
have
rbi
if
he
starts
games
hitting
in
the
or
or
spot
in
any
lineup
or
the
spot
in
a
lineup
with
very
good
obp
in
the
hitters
this
applies
for
each
of
the
next
years
i
just
dont
think
hes
that
good
billy
ripken
will
never
again
hit
over
with
ab
so
far
so
good
im
definitely
not
waiting
to
check
this
one
from
fri
sep
no
matter
what
lou
gorman
and
his
scouts
say
paul
quantrill
will
never
ever
be
an
adequate
major
league
starter
never
i
have
never
seen
a
starting
pitcher
who
can
only
strike
out
per
innings
at
aaa
be
successful
in
the
majors
current
plans
seem
to
be
to
use
quantrill
in
long
relief
he
has
a
rubber
arm
and
unusual
delivery
he
might
be
decent

that
role

sun

belle

as

than
he
has

walking
times

five
of
those
were
intentional
okay
so
i

i
might

been
right

are
the
os
going
to
sign
cal
of

elis
wallet
welded
shut
outgoing
money
only
wide
open
for

my
prediction
which
you
may
make
note
of
valentine
is
that
eli
jacobs
will
defer
any
serious
negotiations
on
cal
ripkens
contract
until
the
season
is
over
eli
will
give
cal
every
opportunity
to
have
his
stats
tumble
a
bit
from
last
years
pace
before
coming
forth
with
an
offer
despite
claims
that
was
designed
to
cals
strength
my
feeling
is
that
the
foot
leftcenter
canyon
will
cut
down
on
cals
power
stats
after
all
its
hard
to
credibly
to
offer
millionyear
to
an
allstar
game
mvpal
mvpgold
glove
shortstopbaseball
deity
but
itd
be
a
lot
easier
to
offer
a
similar
salary
to
an
obviously
declining
but
above
average
shortstop
who
had
a
career
year
one
full
season
ago
of
course
if
cal
does
match
his
numbers
then
eli
is
going
to
be
faced
with
a
rather
huge
and
expensive
problem
how
much
did
cal
sign
for
when
did
he
sign
if
i
remember
correctly
he
got
a
rather
hefty
contract
despite
a
weak
season
and
finally
from
thu
sep
generally
because
of
expansion
in
there
will
be
a
lot
of
mediocre
talent
hanging
around
much
of
it
will
not
make
it
as
the
expansion
teams
look
for
younger
talent
around
which
to
build
their
teams
my
specific
predictions
as
of
april
jim
acker
and
cory
snider
will
be
selling
aluminum
siding
snyder
is
still
in
sf
acker
is
gone
neither
charlie
kerfeld
nor
vance
lovelace
presently
in
tiger
aa
but
formerly
big
leaguers
will
be
playing
professional
ball
they
arent
in
the
majors
nor
will
dave
rozema
who
says
hes
keeping
in
shape
with
a
hope
for
another
shot
with
expansion
never
heard
of
him
shawn
hare
and
jody
hurst
will
be
in
the
major
leagues
they
are
outfielders
in
the
tiger
minor
league
system
i
dont
think
they
are
in
the
majors
ron
hassey
will
be
a
minor
league
manager
with
the
yankees
dunno
what
happened
to
him
it
will
be
byebye
for
balboni
if
hes
still
around
hes
stuck
in
the
minors
bo
jackson
will
not
be
a
starter
hm
with
raines
out
bo
looks
to
get
a
lot
of
pt
gary
huckaby
will
have
moved
to
alaska
permanently
theyre
on
the
net
and
dave
kirsch
will
return
to
canada
to
live
hm
thanks
for
listening
