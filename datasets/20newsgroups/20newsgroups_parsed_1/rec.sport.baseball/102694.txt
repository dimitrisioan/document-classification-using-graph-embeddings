even
less
publicized
than
this
however
was
that
the
didnt
come
from
the
padres
but
from
an
unnamed
source
and
that
the
money
didnt
go
to
the
blue
jays
in
toronto
the
money
was
diverted
into
a
london
bank
account
owned
by
a
shadowy
character
named
vincent
gray
i
should
be
so
lucky
the
account
number
must
have
been
rejected
oh
come
on
everybody
on
the
net
has
heard
about
plausible
deniability
youre
not
fooling
anybody
soon
after
that
gray
and
palmer
sent
word
to
ottawa
that
canada
had
achieved
absolute
superiority
over
the
united
states
in
the
field
of
baseballistic
research
as
she
controlled
both
the
ackercook
pitchalike
contest
and
the
binaca
blast
research
institute
the
prime
minister
smiled
i
hope
not
to
think
that
i
would
inadvertantly
give
any
pleasure
to
mulroney
really
ruins
my
day
note
how
quick
vince
was
to
make
the
inference
that
my
post
claimed
that
mulroney
was
smiling
at
the
baseballistics
news
this
sure
looks
like
guilty
knowledge
to
me
realizing
the
taterific
importance
of
this
work
john
palmer
and
i
concluded
that
we
might
be
able
to
pool
some
resources
ie
the
grand
who
will
be
the
stars
this
year
can
anyone
hope
to
combat
brad
arnsbergs
record
start
to
last
year
the
early
money
has
to
be
on
tom
tom
bolton
who
contributed
that
clutch
grandslam
in
his
first
appearance
but
i
expect
lots
of
strong
contenders
this
year
many
of
them
right
here
in
san
diego
jking
