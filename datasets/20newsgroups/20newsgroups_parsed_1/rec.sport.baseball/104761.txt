quoth
a
comment
made
by
one
of
the
braves
announcers
attributed
to
an
anonymous
player
after
friday
nights
game
im
sorry
we
didnt
tie
it
up
i
wanted
to
see
some
more
umpiring
just
about
sums
it
up
sure
like
ron
gant
wasnt
completely
out
of
line
if
i
were
hirschbeck
i
would
have
ejected
in
order
ron
gant
every
single
last
brave
who
came
onto
the
field
and
possibly
bobby
cox
depending
on
the
language
he
used
since
cox
was
the
only
brave
rung
up
i
suspect
i
would
have
thrown
him
out
too
you
simply
can
not
show
up
an
umpire
like
ron
gant
did
it
is
disrespectful
of
not
only
the
home
plate
umpire
but
of
the
dignity
of
the
game

the
most
beautiful
equation
in

for
all
sad
words
of
tongue
and
pen
the
saddest
are
these
