yankee
thoughts

etc

keith
keller
writes
real
long
but
good
post
on
yankee
trades
omitted
i
disagree
on
one
point
velarde
yes
maybe
the
yanks
should
have
let
him
develop
but
he
rode
the
columbus
shuttle
way
too
many
times
to
do
so
probably
the
fault
of
george
but
no
matter
now
his
usefulness
is
done
he
will
not
be
able
to
develop
into
a
good
player
this
deep
in
his
career
at
least
i
dont
think
so
his
fielding
is
horrendous
at
rd
maybe
hed
be
good
at
short
he
cant
his
the
curve
at
all
and
i
think
all
his
trips
from
new
york
to
columbus
and
back
have
demoralized
him
to
the
point
that
he
just
doesnt
care
get
rid
of
him
i
saythe
sooner
the
better
for
both
the
yanks
and
velarde
keith
keller
lets
go
rangers
velarde
hasnt
been
to
columbus
if
i
recall
for
about
three
years
granted
he
hasnt
been
a
full
time
player
but
when
he
does
play
ive
always
thought
he
had
a
good
bat
he
might
be
demoralized
about
not
playing
full
time
but
he
hasnt
been
shuttled
around
i
think
hes
been
in
new
york
ever
since
he
had
hits
in
ab
back
in
or
i
believe
i
dont
think
he
is
gold
glove
calibre
but
he
doesnt
boot
it
around
either
i
think
if
velarde
is
given
a
chance
he
could
become
extremely
productive
i
dont
have
any
stats
to
back
this
up
and
i
dont
know
if
his
defense
would
cost
any
games
but
i
think
he
could
help
and
he
has
this
year
he
has
hr
already
same
goes
for
jim
leyrtiz
he
has
a
big
mouth
but
he
does
get
the
job
done
when
he
concentrates
i
think
the
situation
with
leyritz
is
that
he
believes
he
is
a
potential
superstar
and
he
gets
pissed
about
not
playing
i
think
he
might
have
realized
something
when
the
marlins
or
rockies
didnt
select
him
the
yanks
need
to
worry
about
the
bullpen
right
now
kamieniecki
and
wickmanmilitello
in
the
bullpen
ouch
im
praying
that
the
bp
will
return
to
last
years
form
chris
what
im
listening
to
anything
that
guitar
god
go
yankees
dann
huff
plays
on
