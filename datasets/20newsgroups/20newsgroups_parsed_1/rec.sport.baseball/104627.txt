re
game
length
was
re
braves
update
writes
however
what
is
with
this
policy
of
trying
to
speed
up
the
games
you
are
the
first
person
nonmediot
i
have
seen
endorse
this
policy
i
have
no
problem
with
the
length
of
games
at
all
and
am
tired
of
the
espn
crowd
and
other
announcers
bitching
about
it
i
have
never
been
in
a
ballpark
filled
with
people
looking
at
their
watches
and
shouting
hurry
up
if
i
cough
up
big
bucks
for
a
ticket
i
dont
mind
a
game
that
last
more
than
i
really
dont
understand
it
i
agree
with
nick
whats
the
big
deal
about
long
games
if
you
want
to
watch
baseball
theres
that
much
more
baseball
to
watch
and
yes
baseball
includes
the
space
between
plays
as
well
as
the
plays
themselves
i
suspect
that
a
lot
of
the
complaining
about
long
games
especially
when
its
coming
from
tv
people
has
to
something
to
do
with
advertising
probably
time
wasted
in
the
middle
of
an
inning
say
by
a
batter
stepping
out
of
the
box
to
fiddle
with
his
gloves
or
by
a
pitcher
walking
around
behind
the
mound
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
could
otherwise
be
sold
as
advertising
