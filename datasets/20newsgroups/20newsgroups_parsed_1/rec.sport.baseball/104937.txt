sorry
i
got
ta
disagree
here
last
time
i
played
ball
i
went
up
on
several
occasions
intending
to
hit
a
fly
ball
deep
enough
to
score
the
runner
from
third
or
advance
a
runner
to
third
its
relatively
easy
actually
you
swing
under
the
path
of
the
ball
you
normally
would
to
hit
a
good
line
drive
with
fastballs
its
very
easy
much
more
difficult
with
good
breaking
balls
a
good
hitter
with
excellent
bat
control
can
voluntarily
hit
fly
balls
to
the
outfield
at
least
oh
of
the
time
maybe
more
theres
a
blurb
in
the
stats
scoreboard
about
this
and
though
i
dont
have
the
book
with
me
here
my
memory
is
that
the
best
at
hitting
sac
flies
were
far
below
this
number
