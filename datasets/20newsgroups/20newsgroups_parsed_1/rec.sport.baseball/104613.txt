im
still
catching
up
from
spring
break
but
bear
with
me
in
the
bigs
especially
when
they
havent
even
played
aaa
ball
we
certainly
believe
this
kid
is
going
to
be
very
good
some
day
but
there
is
really
no
need
to
rush
him
especially
since
we
have
a
mega
million
dollar
staff
that
is
probably
well
served
by
a
batterymate
who
is
expereienced
in
game
calling
and
pitcher
handling
lopez
time
will
come
lets
give
him
some
time
in
aaa
javy
lopez
has
proven
over
ab
in
the
minor
leagues
that
he
is
ready
to
play
in
the
majors
he
is
not
being
rushed
players
who
are
clearly
too
good
for
aa
and
play
behind
stiffs
at
the
major
league
level
are
wasting
their
time
and
may
actually
have
a
court
case
against
major
league
management
for
keeping
them
at
aaa
no
maybe
i
need
to
improve
my
writing
skills
lopez
who
is
very
ordinary
defensively
is
not
likely
to
hit
so
well
at
age
unless
lopez
is
me
defensively
im
and
born
to
play
second
base
he
belongs
in
the
major
leagues
training
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chance
maybe
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
couple
starts
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
his
worth
gee
i
dont
know
abs
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
about
as
good
as
your
reasoning
that
the
kid
should
play
a
backup
role
rather
than
start
every
day
at
aaa
talk
about
me
as
a
gm
valentine
isnt
saying
he
should
back
up
hes
saying
he
should
be
put
in
a
position
to
win
the
job
in
the
major
leagues
which
imho
he
would
if
given
the
opportunity
val
if
im
misinterpreting
please
let
me
know
so
far
you
have
come
up
with
two
arguments
against
lopez
he
is
very
ordinary
defensively
he
is
young
and
most
players
suck
when
they
are
young
the
first
is
irrelevant
hes
trying
to
make
the
majors
with
his
bat
and
the
second
involves
seriously
warped
reasoning
valentine
ok
most
players
are
not
ready
for
the
bigs
at
age
see
current
related
posting
on
clayton
one
of
my
favorites
most
players
benefit
rather
than
being
stagnant
or
hurt
by
playing
at
aaa
most
catchers
need
to
be
solid
defensively
players
to
help
their
clubs
in
the
bigs
those
are
the
arguments
against
lopez
for
the
braves
for
this
year
but
the
players
who
are
ready
are
the
best
and
the
ones
most
likely
to
benefit
from
being
in
the
majors
javy
lopez
is
not
a
middle
oftheroad
prospect
hes
the
real
thing
now
again
the
most
important
thing
a
player
can
do
is
hit
lopez
does
that
miles
better
than
olson
or
berryhill
if
his
defense
is
good
enough
for
greenville
or
richmond
its
good
enough
for
atlanta
if
he
really
was
awful
defensively
he
would
no
longer
be
a
catcher
see
sprague
ed
now
the
braves
have
two
catchers
who
have
demonstrated
solid
abilities
to
call
games
to
work
with
the
pitchers
to
throw
out
runners
not
superstars
mind
you
but
solid
experienced
veterans
the
braves
have
a
very
solid
lineup
with
two
big
bats
in
the
outfield
an
excellent
platoon
at
first
a
solid
mvp
candidate
at
third
and
one
of
the
better
hitting
shortstops
the
center
field
platoon
will
probably
hit
however
good
lopez
what
they
have
to
offset
the
differential
in
experience
and
defensive
ability
the
kid
will
improve
playing
at
aaa
and
he
probably
wont
being
a
reserve
with
the
big
club
oh
where
to
start
ok
first
of
all
solid
good
i
want
good
players
solid
is
one
of
those
words
used
to
describe
nice
white
guys
who
really
arent
very
good
at
baseball
think
of
it
as
twg
without
the
caps
its
a
losing
strategy
to
say
we
have
solid
guys
we
dont
need
to
improve
you
used
it
four
times
in
that
paragraph
btw
same
for
experienced
i
might
add
though
that
greg
olson
and
damon
berryhill
arent
exactly
carter
and
fisk
olson
has
played
three
years
berryhill
five
although
and
were
a
wash
the
only
difference
imho
between
olson
and
valle
is
the
supporting
cast
two
big
bats
hrm
i
like
justice
but
i
find
mr
gants
trend
disturbing
call
it
one
and
a
maybe
the
braves
platoon
is
ok
but
neither
player
has
any
value
outside
of
the
platoon
bream
vs
lh
and
hunter
vs
rh
are
awful
ill
leave
the
thirdbase
comment
alone
pendleton
has
wasted
too
much
bandwidth
already
if
the
cf
platoon
hits
ill
retrace
mr
likhanis
midnight
run
down
forbes
and
i
live
in
ny
and
la
got
that
mike
and
doesnt
cox
call
pitches
anyway
goodness
do
you
believe
the
other
poster
who
thinks
lopez
is
being
held
down
because
of
his
future
earning
potential
why
on
earth
do
you
people
thinkthe
braves
made
this
decision
are
they
idiots
who
have
built
this
ballclub
jeeeesh
nope
theyre
baseball
management
possible
the
most
shortsighted
collection
of
people
in
the
nation
do
you
not
believe
this
goes
on
mark
do
you
think
frank
thomas
needed
those
three
months
in
aaa
in
or
cal
eldred
wasnt
really
better
than
ricky
bones
last
year
and
im
the
treasure
youre
mostly
polite
make
defensible
if
flawed
cases
have
wit
and
have
in
the
past
admitted
being
wrong
that
does
qualify
you
on
rsb
well
make
an
sdcn

of
you
