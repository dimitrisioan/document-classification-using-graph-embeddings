of

this
is
not
the
same
as
claiming
as
some
do
that
galarragas
inability
to
defer
gratification
isnt
hurting
his
team
because
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
or
is
an
rbi
guy
or
whatever
alright
thats
enough
ive
suffered
with
all
kinds
of
insults
as
typical
for
the
net
but
give
me
a
break
galarraga
is
currently
batting
over
and
you
guys
are
complaining
that
he
isnt
drawing
enough
walks
what
would
he
have
to
do
to
please
you
guys
bat
you
can
hardly
claim
that
he
is
hurting
his
team
it
would
help
if
his
obp
were
higher
than
his
batting
average
yes
the
april
usa
today
lists
le
grand
chapeau
as
having
a
batting
average
and
a
obp
thats
on
for
hitting
with
zip
nil
nada
walks
the
reason
a
lot
of
us
are
down
on
galarraga
is
that
hes
has
a
long
history
of
showing
that
this
is
nowhere
near
his
real
level
of
ability
except
for
drawing
walks
if
he
hit
for
say
even
abs
id
be
convinced
that
there
was
a
real
change
in
his
ability
if
he
did
it
with
an
obpavg
id
not
only
be
amazed
but
id
make
a
bet
that
that
would
be
a
unique
feat
in
the
history
of
the
game
but
what
do
abs
prove
look
at
some
of
the
other
fluke
players
at
this
point
in
the
season
player
avg
ab
blauser
grace
milligan
conine
lansing
slaught
are
any
of
these
guys
really
that
good
well
in
a
word
no
how
significant
is
galarragas
average
at
the
ab
level
a
hit
is
worth
about
if
hed
had
one
of
those
hits
called
an
error
and
one
taken
away
by
a
good
defensive
play
hed
be
in
the
range
if
he
goes
for
in
his
next
game
hes
all
the
way
down
to
in
one
game
come
back
in
june
lets
talk
then
if
it
happens
that
the
pitchers
start
throwing
him
fewer
good
pitches
and
he
starts
making
lots
of
outs
as
someone
speculated
might
happen
then
i
would
agree
with
you
that
he
isnt
taking
enough
pitches
my
comment
that
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
doesnt
mean
that
he
should
have
a
license
to
swing
at
bad
pitches
and
make
outs
its
more
along
the
lines
of
hes
batting
and
leading
the
league
in
rbis
so
what
bloody
difference
does
it
make
if
he
isnt
drawing
a
lot
of
walks
sheesh
its
history
greg
andres
history
is
that
he
doesnt
walk
much
because
he
swings
at
bad
pitches
so
his
average
isnt
very
good
abs
doesnt
mean
an
awful
lot
compared
to
a
history
of
a
couple
of
thousand
especially
when
theres
ample
evidence
bb
in
that
his
basic
hitting
approach
hasnt
changed
yeah
he
might
suddenly
have
turned
into
a
hitter
who
never
walks
but
dont
bet
the
rent
money
on
it
