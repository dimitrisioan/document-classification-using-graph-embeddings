all
i
can
say
is
that
imo
someone
on
the
braves
roster
is
about
to
become
pipped
it
may
not
even
be
hunter
but
i
think
theyll
have
a
problem
getting
klesko
out
of
the
lineup
once
hes
in
well
this
may
be
good
news
if
klesko
hits
id
look
for
bream
to
be
traded
if
possible
or
released
since
bream
is
also
a
lefthander
hope
klesko
hits
according
to
the
atlanta
paper
bream
will
be
the
fulltime
first
baseman
with
klesko
used
as
a
lateinning
defensive
replacement
if
bream
is
lifted
for
a
pinchrunner
hed
have
to
hit
a
homer
in
his
first
ab
or
win
the
game
or
do
some
other
amazing
thing
to
be
rewarded
with
a
start
so
he
could
even
attempt
to
push
hunter
or
bream
out
of
the
lineup
