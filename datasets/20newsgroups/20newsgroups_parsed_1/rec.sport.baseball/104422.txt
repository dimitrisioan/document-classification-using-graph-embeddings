disclaimer
this
is
for
fun
in
my
computerized
baseball
game
i
keep
track
of
a
category
called
stolen
hits
defined
as
a
play
made
that
an
average
fielder
would
not
make
with
average
effort
using
the
defensive
averages

thanks
sherri
ive
figured
out
some
defensive
stats
for
the
second
basemen
hits
stolen
have
been
redefined
as
plays
kurt
stillwell
would
not
have
made
ok
i
realize
thats
unfair
kurts
probably
the
victim
of
pitching
staff
fluke
shots
and
a
monster
park
factor
but
lets
put
it
this
way
if
we
replaced
every
second
baseman
in
the
nl
with
someone
with
kurts
out
making
ability
how
many
extra
hits
would
go
by
to
try
and
correlate
it
to
reality
a
little
more
ive
calculated
net
hits
stolen
based
on
the
number
of
outs
made
compared
to
what
a
league
average
fielder
would
make
by
the
same
method
ive
calculated
net
double
plays
and
net
extra
bases
doubles
and
triples
let
by
finally
i
throw
all
this
into
a
a
formula
i
call
defensive
contribution
or
dcon
basically
it
represents
the
defensive
contribution
of
a
player
i
add
this
number
to
ops
to
get
dops
defense
onbase
plus
slug
which
should
represent
the
players
total
contribution
to
the
team
so
dont
take
it
too
seriously
the
formula
for
dcon

why
such
a
bizzare
formula
basically
its
designed
to
be
added
into
the
ops
with
the
idea
that
a
run
prevented
is
as
important
as
a
run
scored
the
extra
outs
are
factored
into
obp
while
the
extra
bases
removed
are
factored
into
slg
thats
why
i
used
pa
and
ab
as
the
divisors
