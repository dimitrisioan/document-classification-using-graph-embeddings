inning
scores
deleted
at
just
that
exact
time
to
see
the
message
even
results
after
the
game
is
over
are
not
necessary
thanks
to
mr
hernandez
who
posts
daily
standings
and
results
here
every
day
am
i
supposed
to
take
that
as
a
compliment
or
a
put
down
just
wondering
it
was
meant
entirely
as
a
compliment
i
do
this
as
a
service
to
the
entire
baseball
world
on
usenet
especially
for
those
in
the
east
coast
who
cant
get
final
scores
for
west
coast
games
in
their
newspapers
or
late
tv
newscasts
this
is
helpful
to
fans
in
other
countries
who
either
receive
only
weekly
scores
or
updates
by
the
week
also
many
have
requested
for
this
kind
of
service
previously
but
it
was
only
available
through
bbss
or
some
pay
news
services
by
the
way
mine
is
free
of
charge
and
has
no
copyright
restrictions
i
was
not
trying
to
criticize
your
service
at
all
in
fact
i
was
trying
to
encourage
others
to
use
it
i
dont
personally
use
it
but
im
sure
others
do
and
that
was
my
point
in
postingthere
is
no
need
for
individuals
to
duplicate
in
an
ad
hoc
fashion
what
you
have
already
organized
if
you
want
to
send
updates
and
scores
set
up
a
private
mailing
list
and
use
that
remember
i
only
post
final
scores
and
the
updated
standings
once
a
day
to
the
recsportbaseball
newsgroup
other
than
that
everything
is
done
through
private
email
currently
there
are
people
on
my
mailing
list
that
branches
off
into
other
mailing
lists
available
for
many
others
and
the
list
grows
by
an
average
of
people
a
day
having
one
person
such
as
yourself
who
does
it
is
a
great
idea
having
do
it
is
not
thats
all
keep
up
the
good
work
