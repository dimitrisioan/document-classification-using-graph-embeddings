based
only
on
this
data
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
pinchhit
for
sabo
or
any
other
player
who
had
been
a
poor
clutch
hitter
in
the
past
but
there
are
many
other
factors
involved
in
a
decision
to
pinchhit
does
the
pinchhitter
give
you
a
platoon
advantage
any
portion
of
sabos
clutch
split
that
results
from
his
platoon
split
is
certainly
a
real
ability
even
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
clutch
hitting
do
you
have
a
singles
hitter
at
the
plate
when
you
need
a
home
run
do
you
have
a
curveball
pitcher
facing
a
batter
who
has
trouble
with
curves
hey
whats
this
we
agree
no
platoon
advantage
sabo
vs
samuel
both
players
have
a
reputation
of
being
excellent
fastball
hitters
and
both
have
a
reputation
of
being
fooled
too
often
with
slow
curves
and
change
ups
sabo
has
more
power
and
a
little
bit
of
a
better
batting
eye
samuel
is
noted
as
an
agressive
freeswinger
sabo
has
more
homerun
power
both
players
started
the
game
hitting
below
there
may
have
been
some
game
considerations
that
might
have
prompted
perez
to
want
to
reserve
samuel
for
use
later
but
the
game
was
on
the
line
and
samuel
never
did
get
in
given
all
of
this
i
dont
see
a
lot
to
suggest
pinchhitting
nor
do
i
see
anything
to
suggest
no
pinchhitting
there
is
of
course
the
clutchhitting
information
but
if
thats
useless
then
again
if
its
not
david

are
sorry
but

rotate

degrees
