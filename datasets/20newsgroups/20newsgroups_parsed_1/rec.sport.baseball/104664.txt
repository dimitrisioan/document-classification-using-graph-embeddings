re
braves
giants
the
situation
with
the
giants
bleachers
is
a
case
in
point
for
the
need
for
a
commissioner
this
is
true
but
the
main
thing
the
commish
ie
selig
needs
to
do
is
to
suspend
bobby
cox
you
can
not
allow
a
team
to
come
out
at
the
ump
as
the
braves
did
i
usually
rip
umps
but
in
this
case
the
players
were
dead
wrong
cox
should
go
for
games
if
i
had
ever
umped
a
game
where
that
happened
id
have
ejected
every
player
that
came
out
only
cox
and
gant
would
have
been
spared
and
then
cox
would
have
gone
in
the
ensuing
argument
