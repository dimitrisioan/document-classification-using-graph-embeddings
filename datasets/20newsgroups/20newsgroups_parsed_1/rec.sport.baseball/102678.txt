whenever
a
person
is
put
on
the
day
day
or
day
the
person
is
on
the
list
longer
than
the
specificed
time
ive
seen
a
person
on
the
day
for
maybe
months
last
year
i
dont
remember
what
i
just
need
a
little
clarification
on
the
disabled
list
specifications
i
believe
we
are
down
to
two
the
day
and
the
day
i
dont
remember
a
day
but
rather
a
day
anyways
its
gone
now
the
period
length
is
a
minimum
not
a
maximum
you
can
keep
a
guy
on
the
day
for
as
long
as
you
want
if
hes
still
certified
as
injured
the
player
must
be
periodically
reevaluated
to
determine
if
hes
still
injured
thus
you
can
not
park
a
player
on
the
dl
who
maybe
is
out
of
options
and
you
do
not
wish
to
expose
to
waivers
if
you
get
someone
qualified
for
the
day
that
reduces
the
frequency
of
reevaluations
there
is
no
longer
i
believe
any
limit
to
the
number
of
players
you
can
place
on
the
dl
when
there
was
you
often
had
to
choose
and
juggle
your
injured
players
