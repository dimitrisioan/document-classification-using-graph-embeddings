name
mitchell
kevin
yep
that
kevin
mitchell
i
never
would
have
expected
him
in
the
spot
gonzales
rene
its
no
accident
that
the
first
two
names
are
only
as
with
first
and
second
base
was
the
year
of
the
glove
average
da
was
points
higher
in
both
leagues
than
any
other
year
leius
scott
looks
good
too
bad
hes
moving
to
short
pendleton
terry
highest
fiveyear
regular
though
hes
only
had
one
year
as
good
as
kevin
mitchell

the
other
elite
fielders
in
the
league
pagliarulo
mike
this
is
an
interesting
line
his
figure
was
slightly
below
average
his
was
pathetic
and
his
was
the
next
best
year
by
anybody
part
of
that
may
be
his
mobility
was
with
the
yankees
was
with
the
padres
who
appear
to
have
a
rotten
infield
was
with
the
twins
and
judging
by
leius
and
gaetti
the
metrodome
may
be
a
good
place
to
play
third
williams
matt
add
another
to
the
elite
fielders
list
caminiti
ken
sabo
chris
too
fielders
whose
career
average
may
overstate
their
value
i
dont
know
what
happened
to
caminiti
judging
by
the
three
previous
years
his
low
may
be
a
fluke
sabo
is
merely
average
however
his
incredible
best
year
ever
brings
his
average
up
a
lot
buechele
steve
strange
last
two
years
schmidt
mike
according
to
reputation
one
of
the
best
fielders
ever
at
third
base
but
at
the
end
he
was
below
average
average
in
was
boggs
wade
boggs
has
been
pretty
good
i
dont
know
what
happened
in
but
every
other
year
he
has
been
above
average
usually
by
quite
a
bit
martinez
egdar
last
year
a
fluke
or
a
portent
nl
average
seitzer
kevin
al
average
why
is
it
that
the
two
leagues
usually
have
defensive
averages
very
close
to
one
another
but
very
different
from
year
to
year
any
ideas
jacoby
brook
brook

hansen
dave
magadan
dave
jefferies
greg
three
firsttime
regulars
above
average
in
im
not
sure
why
jefferies
gets
all
the
grief
about
his
fielding
hes
never
had
a
good
year
but
while
at
second
he
improved
to
become
an
average
fielder
and
is
an
average
fielder
at
third
zeile
todd
zeile
on
the
other
hand
is
a
below
average
fielder
each
year
hes
about
points
below
average
and
its
probably
not
just
the
park
since
terry
pendleton
had
excellent
das
in
the
three
years
before
this
baerga
carlos
moving
back
to
second
was
a
good
idea
hayes
chris
so
why
is
hayes
supposed
to
be
good
defensively
hes
had
a
grand
total
of
one
year
above
the
league
da
and
was
pretty
bad
last
year

break

mark
without
the
help
