how
to
speed
up
games
marginally
realistic
you
want
to
speed
up
ballgames
enforce
the
two
minutes
between
innings
as
it
is
many
fields
are
allowing
three
minutes
between
them
fifteen
seconds
before
tv
commercials
are
gone
to
thirty
or
so
before
action
begins
upon
the
return
to
the
game
two
minutes
last
out
to
first
pitch
or
a
ball
is
called
dont
grant
time
to
batters
just
because
they
want
it
they
may
get
pissed
at
first
but
theyll
get
in
line
once
anything
the
pitcher
throws
while
theyre
adjusting
their
wristbands
is
a
strike
mandate
a
rule
permitting
only
n
seconds
between
pitches
the
current
rule
is
too
lenient
and
then
enforce
it
fifteen
seconds
is
more
than
enough
time
if
the
pitch
isnt
released
in
call
it
a
ball
and
restart
the
clock
baseball
games
take
about
in
the
nl
and
just
a
shade
under
hours
in
the
al
thats
just
too
damn
long
i
dont
like
to
play
in
hour
games
much
less
watch
a
game
for
that
long
my
butt
falls
asleep
and
if
im
watching
on
tv
ill
channel
surf
between
pitches
catching
colorized
versions
of
