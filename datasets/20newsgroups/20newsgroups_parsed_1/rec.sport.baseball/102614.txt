re
minnesota
pitching
date
mon
apr
from
karim
edvard
ahmed
since
i
havent
been
able
to
keep
up
with
baseball
much
this
season
i
have
a
few
questions
about
my
favorite
team
the
minnesota
twins
how
good
does
their
rotation
look
the
last
i
heard
the
order
is
tapani
erikson
mahomes
banks
and
some
guy
ive
never
heard
of
sounds
pretty
pathetic
to
me
well
maybe
it
will
be
banks
is
a
yearold
prospect
who
hasnt
matured
as
quickly
as
they
would
have
liked
mahomes
is
a
yearold
who
is
very
highly
touted
tapani
and
erickson
are
also
young
and
have
looked
very
good
this
spring
the
last
spot
was
between
jim
deshaies
formerly
of
houston
and
sd
and
mike
trombley
deshaies
hasnt
looked
very
good
this
spring
so
i
believe
that
the
spot
has
gone
to
trombley
although
they
hadnt
wanted
starters
this
unproven
i
personally
believe
very
highly
in
mahomes
and
trombley
who
is
playing
short
and
third
well
scott
leius
is
the
shortstop
he
played
mostly
b
last
year
but
was
a
ss
in
the
minors
and
moved
back
after
gagne
left
to
kc
b
is
split
maybe
between
pagliarulo
who
has
had
a
great
spring
and
terry
jorgenson
a
good
looking
kid
who
has
languished
in
portland
for
years
im
not
sure
how
the
time
will
be
divided
but
they
seem
to
be
happy
with
what
they
have
here
i
like
jorgenson
but
i
fear
they
might
give
too
much
time
to
pags
hows
winfield
doing
sorry
cant
help
you
here
