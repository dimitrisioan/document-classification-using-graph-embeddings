to
say
that
one
player
is
better
than
another
is
to
be
able
to
say
ab
solutely
that
player
as
team
would
have
played
better
with
player
b
in
their
lineup
sheer
speculation
impossible
to
ascertain
there
are
very
few
disciplines
where
certainty
is
necessary
to
state
something
as
fact
baseball
is
not
one
of
them
therefore
i
can
say
that
i
know
clemens
was
better
than
morris
last
year
and
larkin
was
better
than
griffin
no
i
cant
ascertain
this
i
cant
prove
it
but
im
not
required
to
do
so
and
since
you
obviously
feel
that
such
threads
are
meaningless
why
dont
you
simply
stay
out
of
them
valentine
no
im
not
going
to
be
cordial
roger
maynard
is
a
complete
and
total
dickhead
send
me
email
if
you
insist

details
