from
ian
m
derby
i
personally
will
never
forget
mike
schmidts
home
run
against
the
expos
in
that
decided
the
nl
east
it
was
also
his
career
high
th
another
home
run
that
i
thought
was
totally
incredible
was
in
the
alcs
the
ca
angles
had
the
boston
red
sox
strike
away
from
the
pennant
until
don
baylor
hit
a
two
strike
pitch
for
a
home
run
that
was
the
most
incredible
turn
of
events
i
have
ever
seen
in
baseball
the
sox
later
took
the
pennant
away
only
to
have
the
same
thing
done
to
them
in
the
ws
against
the
mets
speaking
of
the
mets
isnt
it
strange
how
the
nlcs
that
year
with
the
astros
almost
mirrored
the
nlcs
with
the
phillies
the
astros
have
been
painfully
close
twice
i
must
admit
