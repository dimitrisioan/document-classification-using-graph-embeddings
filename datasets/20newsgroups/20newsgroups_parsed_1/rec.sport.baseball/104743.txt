if
i
were
the
manager
id
argue
that
the
runner
was
out
of
the
base
line
since
he
was
to
the
left
of
the
first
base
line
if
the
umps
dont
budge
which
they
wont
they
nev
er
admit
when
they
are
wrong
id
file
a
protest
with
the
league
rule
k
states
it
is
interference
by
a
batter
or
runner
when
in
running
the
last
half
of
the
distance
from
home
base
to
first
base
he
runs
outside
the
threefoot
line
or
inside
to
the
left
of
the
foul
line
and
in
the
umpires
judgment
interferes
with
the
field
er
taking
the
throw
at
first
base
the
key
word
in
the
rule
is
and
a
runner
isnt
out
just
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
hes
out
for
interfering
with
the
fielding
of
the
ball
or
throw
or
fielding
of
the
throw
to
first
because
the
catcher
opted
to
throw
the
ball
over
the
batterrunners
head
theres
no
inter
ference
so
what
is
your
definition
of
interfering
with
the
fielder
taking
the
throw
the
rule
book
certainly
doesnt
have
a
definiton
or
clarification
so
its
possible
to
interpret
the
rule
as
saying
that
if
the
catcher
has
to
alter
his
throw
to
avoid
hitting
the
batterrunner
then
again
we
have
interference
you
know
it
seems
that
there
is
no
way
to
apply
this
rule
justlyif
the
catcher
or
the
pitcher
say
rob
dibble
for
example
throws
toward
first
and
hits
the
runner
running
inside
the
baseline
the
fielder
takes
the
chance
of
being
ejected
therefore
he
probably
would
throw
around
the
runner
or
your
scenario
above
him
you
should
note
that
in
our
american
legion
league
which
uses
mlb
rules
we
interpret
the
rule
to
say
in
this
very
circumstance
there
is
interference
per
rule
