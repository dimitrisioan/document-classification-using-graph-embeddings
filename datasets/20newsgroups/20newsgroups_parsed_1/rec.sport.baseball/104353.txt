two
other
people
whose

wrote
the
chapter
on

players
this
is
a
good
source
for
some
of
the
more
famous
anecdotes
about

also
excellent
is
the
section
on
him
in

mentioned
in
the
recent
book
heisenbergs
war
his
sister
also
wrote
a
book
about
moe
that
she

something
like
my

morris
berg

mainly
some
of
her
memories

page
of
xerox
copies
of
