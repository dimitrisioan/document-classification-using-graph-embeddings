spanky
isnt
very
good
defensively
anymore
hes
an
offensive
liability
and
judging
from
his
outburst
this
winter
after
the
bucs
failed
to
sign
drabek
hes
a
jerk
with
his
head
in
the
sand
tommy
prince
on
the
other
hand
cant
hit
in
the
paper
simmons
was
citing
the
case
of
tom
pagnozzi
who
never
hit
in
the
minors
or
majors
but
suddenly
somehow
learned
how
geez
dal
must
have
slipped
something
into
teds
drink
sometime
comparing
prince
to
pagnozzi
offensively
is
laughable
prince
has
never
hit
well
in
the
minors
and
hes
now
years
old
i
think
pagnozzi
was
not
a
bad
hitter
in
the
minors
ill
bring
in
the
numbers
tomorrow
assuming
i
dont
have
another
brain
cramp
and
forget
he
had
a
very
good
year
at
louisville
before
coming
up
to
the
majors
as
i
recall
the
hype
on
pagnozzi
coming
up
in
the
organization
was
good
hit
decent
fielding
when
he
got
to
the
majors
and
didnt
hit
as
well
as
expected
not
as
much
playing
time
he
became
exhibit
in
nichols
law
of
catcher
defense
and
got
the
reputation
as
an
outstanding
defensive
catcher
its
not
clear
he
ever
learned
to
hit
his
four
years
with
more
than
ab
born
july
year
ab

walks
peak
year
when
he
turned
now
declining
if
ted
is
going
to
invoke
pagnozzi
as
a
model
for
prince
given
that
prince
has
underperformed
pagnozzi
in
the
minors
its
not
a
rosy
picture
btw
im
still
unhappy
with
moving
zeile
who
had
the
same
reputation
coming
up
in
the
cardinal
organization
as
pagnozzi
except
that
he
was
a
much
much
better
hitter
to
rd
where
he
could
be
an
average
hitter
and
a
below
average
fielder
instead
of
a
wellabove
average
hitter
as
an
average
or
below
