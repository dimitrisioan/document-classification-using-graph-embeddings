not
clear
to
me
at
all
id
certainly
rather
have
a
team
who
was
winning
games
than
games
in
the
game
luck
is
going
to
play
a
much
bigger
role
than
in
the
game
but
you
still
need
the
pitching
staff
to
hold
the
opposing
team
to
one
run
yeah
but
whats
your
point
you
still
need
the
offense
to
score
more
runs
than
you
allow
too
the
braves
do
have
a
fine
pitching
staff
but
thats
still
only
half
the
game
