grateful
dead
being
a
baseball
fan
and
a
fan
of
the
above
mentioned
band
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
clue
me
in
on
whether
the
dead
or
members
of
sang
the
national
anthem
at
todays
giant
opener
i
would
imagine
that
it
is
a
bit
too
early
for
anyone
to
know
but
an
answer
would
be
greatly
appreciated
curious
