speed
up
games
marginally
realistic
gary
built
like

said
baseball
games
take
about
in
the
nl
and
just
a
shade
under
hours
in
the
al
thats
just
too
damn
long
i
dont
like
to
play
in
hour
games
much
less
watch
a
game
for
that
long
my
butt
falls
asleep
and
if
im
watching
on
tv
ill
channel
surf
between
pitches
catching
colorized
versions
of
mr
ed
leave
it
to
beaver
and
those
wacky
nieporents
on
nick
at
nite
but
gary
for
certain
sofa
tubers
like
myself
this
is
an
advantage
i
can
watch
the
pirates
on
kbl
the
mets
on
wwor
the
braves
on
tbs
and
the
mediots
on
espn
at
the
same
time
without
missing
anything
if
something
impressive
happens
ill
catch
the
replay
so
i
see
essentially
games
in
hours
instead
of
game
in
hours
what
a
deal
insert
smileys
as
desired
