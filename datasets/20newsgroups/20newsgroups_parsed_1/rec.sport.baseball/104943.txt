aguilera
continues
to
be
shaky
against
the
brew
crew
of
career
blown
saves
have
come
against
the
brew
crew
and
todays

was
shaky
as
well

a
lead
aguilera
gave
up
a
solo
hr
to
vaughn

pedro
munoz
continues
to
improve
as
an
outfielder
playing
in
left
field
on
tuesdays
game
he
continues
to
bat
weakly
against
right
handed
pitching
though
which
has
limited
his
playing
time
gene
larkin
and
jt
bruettformer
gopher
have
been
playing

can
bat

begin

mahomes
banks
the
detroit
tigers
have
had
two
run
games
in
the
last
ten
days
and
should
provide
quite
a
challenge
to
the
young

much
improvement

jim
deshaies
has
three
pickoffs
and
one
balk
this
year
some
say
he
has
the
best
st
base
move
in
baseball
this
move
has
enabled
him
to
pitch
out
of
some
tight
early
jams
and
has
certainly
contributed
to
his
start
watch
to
see
if
umpiring
crews
began
calling
the
balk
more
tightly
in
response
to
opposing
team
complaints
about
his
leg
kicking
behind
the
rubber
on
the
pickoff
move
