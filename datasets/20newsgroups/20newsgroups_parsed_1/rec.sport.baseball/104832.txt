re
why
is
barry
bonds
not
batting
th
consistent
hitter
definitely
the
best
in
the
national
league
imho
to
have
williams
a
streaky
hitter
and
not
really
a
clutch
hitter
batting
th
ahead
of
bonds
is
simply
an
injustice
to
the
giants
and
fans
of
the
giants
having
bonds
batting
behind
williams
means
that
matt
will
get
more
good
pitches
to
hit
this
is
important
since
he
struggles
so
much
with
breaking
balls
opposing
pitchers
dont
want
to
walk
williams
to
get
to
bonds
youre
definitely
correct
in
that
williams
absolutely
has
to
be
sandwiched
in
between
clark
and
bonds
he
must
and
i
mean
must
get
fastballs
to
hitotherwise
he
becomes
little
more
than
sixto
lezcano
in
disguise
what
i
would
suggest
is
perhaps
batting
bonds
williams
and
clark
the
reason
being
that
i
feel
bonds
potential
basestealing
abilities
are
wasted
when
hes
stuck
behind
two
slow
runners
i
think
the
chance
of
getting
extra
stolen
bases
with
bonds
in
the
spot
would
more
than
offset
any
drop
in
in
run
production
by
having
clark
in
the
spot
matt
