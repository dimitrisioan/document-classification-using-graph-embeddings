re
rickey
henderson
and
michael
jackson
jack
nicholson
and
bill
cosby
wouldnt
be
making
near
as
much
money
if
they
werent
entertainers
so
whats
your
point
actually
i
could
care
less
what
his
salary
is
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we
live
in
america
and
everyone
is
entitled
to
whatever
he
can
legally
obtain
if
sandy
alderson
and
the
haas
family
willingly
negotiate
a
salary
of
million
per
year
with
rickey
i
couldnt
care
less
but
what
really
gets
my
goat
is
the
bullshit
he
spouted
in
spring
training
about
well
sometimes
i
may
not
play
as
hard
or
might
be
hurt
more
often
in
a
place
where
im
not
appreciated
this
quote
was
in
the
chronicle
about
the
second
week
of
camp
and
strongly
suggests
that
he
was
going
to
dog
it
all
year
if
the
ownership
didnt
kiss
his
butt
and
ante
up
some
more
money
for
gods
sake
rickey
you
signed
a
contract
years
ago
now
honor
it
and
play
say
all
you
want
to
about
steve
garvey
and
believe
me
i
hated
him
too
but
at
least
when
he
put
his
signature
on
a
piece
of
paper
he
shut
his
mouth
and
played
hard
until
the
contract
was
up
