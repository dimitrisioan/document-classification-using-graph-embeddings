i
apologize
for
the
misunderstanding
i
explained
that
i
know
that
it
is
essential
for
some
fans
to
get
scores
here
for
they
can
not
get
them
elsewhere
i
have
no
problem
with
what
you
do
posting
scores
after
the
games
have
been
completed
however
like
i
said
earlier
i
dont
think
it
is
a
necessity
to
post
scores
during
the
middle
of
games
like
some
others
have
come
to
practice
