gross
grosses
out
dodger
fans
again
went
to
the
dodgers
game
tonight
it
was
cap
night
astacio
pitched
ok
but
had
control
trouble
all
night
in
the
first
he
walked
a
batter
balked
him
to
second
then
a
single
scored
the
run
with
the
batter
taking
second
on
the
throw
home
another
single
made
the
score
cards
lasorda
tried
a
new
line
up
featuring
butler
reed
and
piazza
batting
third
darryl
and
eric
were
benched
in
favor
of
snyder
and
webster
piazza
homered
in
the
first
to
make
the
score
cards
the
dodgers
tied
the
game
in
the
second
on
a
two
out
single
by
offerman
by
the
fourth
inning
astacio
had
already
made
about
pitches
but
the
score
was
still
the
dodger
defense
made
several
impressive
plays
piazza
looked
great
behind
the
plate
gunning
down
a
runner
trying
to
steal
second
throwing
a
runner
out
at
first
who
had
strayed
a
bit
from
first
base
etc
karros
also
made
a
spectacular
play
keeping
a
ball
from
going
into
the
outfield
the
runner
on
first
was
so
sure
that
ball
was
going
through
he
just
kept
running
past
second
karros
got
up
and
threw
to
third
and
easily
got
the
runner
at
third
my
heart
sank
in
the
th
when
gross
got
up
to
warm
up
in
the
bullpen
astacio
was
lifted
for
a
pinch
hitter
and
when
gross
entered
the
game
with
the
score
still
dodger
fans
just
knew
it
was
over
gross
was
relieving
because
he
stunk
on
tuesday
pitching
just
innings
forcing
lasorda
to
use
much
of
his
bullpen
the
inning
game
had
the
same
effect
the
next
nightso
only
gross
was
fresh
given
his
light
work
out
tuesday
gross
lived
up
to
his
name
he
walked
the
first
batter
gave
up
a
hit
to
the
second
and
walked
the
bases
loaded
after
a
grounder
resulted
in
a
force
at
home
zeile
lifted
a
scoring
fly
ball
to
make
it
cards
gross
paid
little
attention
to
the
runners
and
the
next
thing
you
knew
the
cards
had
stolen
a
fourth
run
the
runner
on
first
was
eventually
tagged
out
in
the
run
down
but
the
th
run
had
scored
long
before
that
meanwhile
the
dodgers
mounted
little
offense
after
the
second
inning
lee
smith
pitched
the
ninth
he
had
little
trouble
getting
karros
and
wallach
does
anyone
have
trouble
with
wallach
these
days
cory
snyder
collected
his
first
hit
as
a
dodger
a
single
but
that
was
all
the
offense
the
dodgers
could
mount
smith
got
his
third
straight
save
against
the
dodgers
and
all
i
got
was
my
free
dodger
cap
and
a
good
look
at
piazza
if
piazza
keeps
this
up
all
year
he
will
be
a
strong
candidate
for
rookie
of
the
year
honors
though
its
really
early
karros
is
already
showing
signs
of
a
sophomore
jinx
