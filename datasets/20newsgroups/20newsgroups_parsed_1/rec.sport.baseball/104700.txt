a
reasonable
umpire
would
do
as
hes
been
instructed
to
do
this
season
get
the
batters
back
in
the
box
sooner
to
try
to
cut
down
on
the
ridiculous
length
of
games
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
this
happen
i
agree
that
hirschbeck
was
just
doing
what
he
was
instructed
to
do
and
also
that
gant
should
have
listened
to
him
however
what
is
with
this
policy
of
trying
to
speed
up
the
games
you
are
the
first
person
nonmediot
i
have
seen
endorse
this
policy
i
have
no
problem
with
the
length
of
games
at
all
and
am
tired
of
the
espn
crowd
and
other
announcers
bitching
about
it
i
have
never
been
in
a
ballpark
filled
with
people
looking
at
their
watches
and
shouting
hurry
up
if
i
cough
up
big
bucks
for
a
ticket
i
dont
mind
a
game
that
last
more
than
i
really
dont
understand
it
games
are
longer
now
for
several
reasons
more
pitching
changes
more
basestealing
and
throws
to
first
etci
think
a
very
small
factor
is
the
increased
time
it
takes
jose
canseco
deion
sanders
insert
fancy
showboat
ballplayer
here
to
arrange
their
jewelry
prior
to
stepping
in
the
batters
box
my
impression
is
that
sportcasters
and
writers
have
made
this
an
issue
because
they
like
shorter
games
they
get
to
head
back
to
hotel
bar
eat
steaks
get
drunk
tell
stupid
jokes
with
their
pals
and
chase
stewardesses
around
the
bar
sure
they
want
the
game
over
with
print
journalists
have
a
slightly
more
legitimate
reason
for
wanting
faster
games
they
have
deadlines
the
espn
guys
on
baseball
tonight
drive
me
crazy
they
constantly
harp
on
this
primarily
because
they
often
have
to
work
late
when
the
game
goes
longer
than
maybe
i
am
just
a
neerdowell
with
nothing
better
to
do
but
i
would
like
to
hear
reasons
why
the
longer
games
upset
you
as
a
parenthetical
note
it
seems
the
league
is
in
any
case
fighting
a
losing
battle
this
year
the
increased
offense
thus
far
will
certainly
spoil
any
hopes
of
getting
the
games
over
with
more
quickly
