every
single
piece
of
evidence
we
can
find
points
to
major
league
baseball
being
offense
defense
a
run
scored
is
just
as
important
as
a
run
prevented
of
course
a
run
scored
is
just
as
important
as
a
run
prevented
just
as
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
earned
enough
with
the
cliches
its
not
a
cliche
and
unlike
your
comments
below
its
not
a
tautology
it
neednt
have
been
true
if
every
pitcher
in
baseball
were
essentially
the
same
in
quality
ie
if
the
variance
of
pitching
ability
were
much
smaller
than
the
variance
of
batting
ability
then
scoring
runs
would
be
much
more
important
than
preventing
them
simply
because
the
ability
to
actively
prevent
runs
would
be
much
weaker
my
point
is
that
if
the
braves
starters
are
able
to
live
up
to
their
potential
they
wont
need
much
offensive
support
if
thats
your
point
you
should
have
said
so
what
you
in
fact
said
was
pitching
and
defense
win
championships
and
later
pitching
is
the
essence
of
baseball
neither
of
which
says
what
you
are
now
claiming
was
your
point
and
neither
of
which
is
true
it
seems
to
me
that
when
quality
pitchers
take
the
mound
the
other
teams
score
less
runs
the
team
that
scores
the
most
runs
wins
and
you
accuse
sherri
of
mouthing
cliches
this
puts
the
team
with
the
better
pitching
at
the
advantage
providing
they
can
stop
the
opposing
team
from
scoring
runs
a
low
scoring
game
would
clearly
benefit
the
braves
its
not
clear
to
me
at
all
that
this
is
true
in
highscoring
games
the
team
with
the
better
offense
wins
a
high
percentage
of
the
time
in
low
scoring
games
the
split
is
essentially
regardless
of
team
ability
they
should
have
many
low
scoring
games
due
to
their
excellent
pitching
and
below
average
hitting
on
the
flip
side
if
you
had
a
starting
lineup
of
great
offensive
players
i
would
be
arguing
that
this
team
would
not
need
great
pitchers
i
thought
you
said
pitching
and
defense
win
championships
and
pitching
is
the
essence
of
baseball
