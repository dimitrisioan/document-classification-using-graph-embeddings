article
writes
but
it
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
bias
and
is
almost
completely
useless
for
first
basemen
from
the
raw
stats
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
of
a
first
basemans
putouts
were
made
on
throws
from
other
fielders
and
which
were
made
on
his
own
plays
likewise
you
cant
tell
whether
a
double
play
was
or
fielding
runs
thus
gives
a
first
baseman
no
credit
for
putouts
or
double
plays
only
for
assists
and
errors
but
ingnoring
putouts
is
biased
in
yet
another
way
range
is
not
the
only
thing
that
makes
a
good
firstbaseman
the
ability
to
field
all
sorts
of
balls
thrown
to
him
digging
some
out
of
the
dirt
stretching
for
others
and
so
forth
is
important
thus
putouts
do
provide
some
information
maybe
what
we
need
is
a
comparision
of
how
many
balls
were
thrown
to
the
area
of
the
first
baseman
vs
how
many
he
actually
got
