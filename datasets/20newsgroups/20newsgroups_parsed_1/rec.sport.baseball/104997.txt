re
strike
zone
width
was
re
jose
cansecos
in
article
writes
well
its
just
studying
tape
frame
by
frame
thats
all
the
biggest
thing
that
you
notice
however
is
how
bastardized
the
strike
zone
has
become
death
to
the
umpires
union
the
plate
is
across
not
call
the
high
strikes
strikes
and
quit
calling
pitches
outside
strikes
theyre
balls
speaking
of
this
wide
strike
zone
id
sure
like
to
see
cameras
placed
in
each
major
league
park
such
that
an
overview
shot
of
home
plate
is
available
cbs
had
this
during
the
ws
or
did
i
just
dream
it
then
again
playersmanagers
must
not
be
too
upset
with
the
current
wide
strike
zone
mark
pede
wait
a
minute
if
i
read
the
rules
right
a
stike
is
any
portion
of
the
ball
over
any
portion
of
the
plate
given
that
the
ball
is
in
diameter
this
sez
that
the
zone
width
is
or
while
this
is
still
less
than
the
number
given
i
can
forgive
any
ump
for
misjudging
on
an
object
moving
at
to
miles
per
hour
many
times
not
in
a
straight
line
i
think
the
umpires
union
has
a
great
grasp
of
the
rules
