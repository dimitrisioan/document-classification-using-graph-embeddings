the
best
home
run
i
have
ever
seen
came
off
believe
it
or
not
roger
clemens
sorry
val
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
threw
a
ball
to
incaviglia
which
was
literally
at
inkys
neck
and
he
absolutely
hammered
the
crap
out
of
it
after
the
swing
clemens
nonchalantly
motioned
for
a
new
ballhe
didnt
even
turn
around
to
look
or
even
get
upset
the
ball
hit
the
lights
in
the
leftfield
standard
some
or
so
feet
about
the
green
monster
over
feet
above
the
ground
total
truly
an
amazing
shot
i
agree
home
runs
off
clemens
are
always
memorable
kinda
like
eclipses
and
hurricanes
they
dont
happen
very
often
cheers
valentine
