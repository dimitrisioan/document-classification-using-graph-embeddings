i
feel
as
if
i
might
be
causing
some
bad
karma
by
doing
this
but
i
just
have
to
know
is
the
ack
man
still
in
organized
baseball
glad
you
asked
the
ackman
and
nine
of
his
relatives
are
currently
impersonating
the
baltimore
orioles
pitching
staff
personally
i
believe
that
the
evil
ackers
kidnapped
the
real
os
staff
and
are
currently
in
the
process
of
impersonating
mussina
sutcliffe
mcdonald
olson
no
no
no
the
ack
man
is
apparently
an
alien
lifeform
much
like
the
pod
people
from
planet
mars
who
can
take
on
any
form
the
ability
remains
the
same
however
the
ackpeople
have
been
spotted
on
many
teams
to
date
but
it
appears
that
the
orioles
staff
mentioned
above
and
the
expos
bullpen
barnes
walton
fassero
gardiner
and
rojas
have
been
the
prime
target
apparently
john
wetteland
was
roughed
up
by
the
ackpeople
during
spring
training
due
to
the
fact
that
his
system
rejected
the
takeover
and
has
been
on
the
dl
ever
since
contact
the
authorities
this
evil
plot
must
be
stopped
the
ackpeople
can
keep
jack
morris
and
juan
guzman
though
i
enjoy
watching
toronto
fans
suffer
too
much
to
want
these
guys
returned
to
normal
