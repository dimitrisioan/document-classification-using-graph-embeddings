so
you
want
to
decrease
players
salaries
so
you
want
to
increase
owners
salaries
the
two
are
equivalent
bob
vesterman
only
if
you
insist
that
the
ticket
prices
can
not
be
adjusted
downward
or
the
taxes
for
the
revenues
to
build
the
ballparks
or
the
parking
charges
or
the
concession
costs
etc
why
would
owners
decrease
ticket
prices
when
they
obviously
get
lots
of
people
to
pay
the
price
theyre
asking
even
assuming
that
you
have
some
strange
power
to
make
the
owners
decrease
ticket
prices
that
does
not
decrease
the
tv
contract
bob
vesterman
so
what
will
happen
when
the
tv
contract
runs
out
considering
networks
have
been
losing
money
on
it
either
ticket
prices
will
go
up
or
someones
salary
will
be
cut
or
perhaps
the
local
community
or
merchindise
could
make
up
the
difference
baseball
is
probably
facing
a
dramatic
drop
in
income
very
soon
and
someone
will
suffer
probably
the
fans
from
higher
ticket
prices
but
definitely
someone
