does
anybody
in
the
pittsburgh
area
know
why
mike
lavalliere
was
released
last
year
i
kept
saying
that
slaught
should
get
the
bulk
of
the
playing
time
that
he
was
clearly
the
better
player
at
this
point
but
leyland
insisted
on
keeping
a
pretty
strict
platoon
and
now
he
is
released
that
doesnt
make
any
sense
to
me
greg
the
story
goes
like
this
spanky
is
too
slow
if
he
were
quicker
he
would
still
be
here
but
with
slaught
and
tom
prince
they
didnt
want
to
lose
prince
in
order
to
bring
up
that
th
pitcher
slaught
is
about
as
good
as
spanky
and
prince
is
coming
along
nicely
well
my
question
still
hasnt
been
answered
if
spanky
was
bad
enough
to
release
this
year
why
did
he
get
so
much
playing
time
last
year
yes
i
know
he
was
part
of
a
platoon
and
thats
why
he
got
more
playing
time
than
slaught
but
that
doesnt
answer
the
question
if
slaught
was
so
obviously
better
this
year
wasnt
this
also
obvious
last
year
and
shouldnt
he
have
been
taking
away
some
of
spankys
playing
time
against
righties
