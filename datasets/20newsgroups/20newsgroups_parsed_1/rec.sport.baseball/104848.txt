does
anyone
else
out
there
not
like
deon
i
think
hes
all
hype
his
season
last
year
was
good
but
im
not
convinced
that
he
can
do
it
again
it
reminds
me
sorry
of
the
year
when
tim
wallach
hit
or
so
homers
and
had
rbi
it
never
even
came
close
to
happening
again
of
course
maybe
i
just
prefer
guys
who
go
about
their
business
and
dont
play
it
up
for
the
attention
just
my
ho
tim
wallach
can
be
explained
with
the
rabbitball
deion
can
be
explained
as
learning
how
to
play
the
game
im
not
betting
that
deion
will
be
able
to
play
as
well
as
last
year
but
i
think
the
odds
of
deion
playing
as
well
or
better
than
he
did
last
year
are
better
than
the
odds
of
otis
nixon
doing
the
same
thing
when
you
factor
in
defense
otis
was
more
valuable
last
year
but
im
not
convinced
hell
be
more
valuable
this
year
and
especially
next
year

it
is
considered

to
