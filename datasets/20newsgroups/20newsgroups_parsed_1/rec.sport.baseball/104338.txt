torre
the
worst
manager
joe
torre
has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
furthermore
in
sundays
game
when
lankford
was
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
showed
bucky
dent
the
third
base
coach
looking
down
the
line
and
waving
lankford
home
i
cant
take
this
anymore
