stay
in
school
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
learn
what
i
know
that
million
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
i
know
rickey
henderson
doesnt
have
a
career
out
of
baseball
i
know
if
he
didnt
have
baseball
he
wouldnt
be
making
near
the
money
he
is
now
and
michael
jackson
jack
nicholson
and
bill
cosby
wouldnt
be
making
near
as
much
money
if
they
werent
entertainers
so
whats
your
point
i
just
dont
understand
how
some
athlete
who
only
plays
a
sport
for
a
living
for
millions
of
dollars
say
he
is
not
being
paid
enough
if
nobody
will
sign
him
for
his
asking
price
he
will
be
the
one
hurting
the
as
will
still
win
without
him
will
they
you
cant
usually
take
away
one
of
the
teams
best
players
and
still
expect
them
to
win
or
do
you
think
the
pirates
will
continue
to
win
without
barry
bonds
remeber
many
of
these
athletes
have
nothing
if
not
for
their
athletic
ability
nothing
they
are
getting
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
working
citizens
and
they
are
complaining
of
not
enough
pay
so
again
jack
nicholson
gets
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
working
citizens
and
much
more
than
rickey
henderson
for
that
matter
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
them
making
millions
my
problem
is
when
the
say
they
arent
being
paid
enough
when
they
already
get
millionalso
their
numbers
get
worse
the
reason
the
latter
often
happens
is
that
many
of
these
folks
start
making
the
real
big
salaries
late
in
their
career
when
they
are
on
the
decline
there
are
exceptions
of
course
dave
parker
fell
apart
after
making
his
first
million
because
he
put
most
of
that
million
up
his
nose
