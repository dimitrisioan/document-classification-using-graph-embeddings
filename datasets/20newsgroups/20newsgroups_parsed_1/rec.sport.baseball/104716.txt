you
want
to
speed
up
ballgames
mandate
a
rule
permitting
only
n
seconds
between
pitches
the
current
rule
is
too
lenient
and
then
enforce
it
fifteen
seconds
is
more
than
enough
time
if
the
pitch
isnt
released
in
call
it
a
ball
and
restart
the
clock
i
remember
a
post
from
last
year
indicating
that
a
pitch
clock
was
tried
in
one
of
the
minor
leagues
some
time
back
and
did
not
work
i
dont
remember
why
they
said
that
it
did
not
work
anyone
remember
this
jody
mcdonnel
on
wip
in
phil
has
been
saying
that
a
pitch
clock
was
inevitable
how
would
a
pitch
clock
work
on
throws
to
first
another
pair
of
suggestions
remove
the
balk
rule
it
is
the
runners
responsibility
to
stay
safe
no
matter
what
the
pitcher
does
if
a
pitcher
throws
to
an
occupied
base
more
than
x
time
x
to
without
successfully
picking
off
the
runner
the
runner
advances
a
base
as
if
walked
the
nobalk
seems
to
give
the
pitcher
the
advantage
the
basewalk
allows
the
runner
to
challenge
pitcher
to
throw
over
to
the
base
baseball
games
take
about
in
the
nl
and
just
a
shade
under
hours
in
the
al
thats
just
too
damn
long
i
dont
like
to
play
in
hour
games
much
less
watch
a
game
for
that
long
my
butt
falls
asleep
and
if
im
watching
on
tv
ill
channel
surf
between
pitches
catching
colorized
versions
of
mr
ed
leave
it
to
beaver
and
those
wacky
nieporents
on
nick
at
nite
i
too
find
myself
surfing
when
i
know
that
it
will
be
enough
time
between
each
pitch
to
allow
the
batter
to
adjust
his
jewlery
