mile
high
runs
how
many
runs
will
be
scored
in
denver
i
dont
know
but
some
idea
can
be
gotten
by
looking
at
the
runs
scored
in
mile
high
stadium
during
the
last
few
years
of
the
bearszephyrs
tenure
in
the
american
association
heres
the
total
runs
scored
per
game
in
zephyrs
games
all
league
games
and
the
ratio
i
found
the
same
ratios
for
hr
year
rpg
lea
ratio
hrpg
lea
ratio
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
denver
will
have
a
large
effect
on
runs
scored
ill
stick
with
my
prediction
from
last
year
that
itll
be
one
of
the
top
in
the
nl
this
year
and
a
fairly
large
effect
on
homeruns
though
apparently
not
as
large
as
atlanta
wrigley
cincinnati
and
san
diego
still
it
ought
to
be
a
pretty
decent
home
