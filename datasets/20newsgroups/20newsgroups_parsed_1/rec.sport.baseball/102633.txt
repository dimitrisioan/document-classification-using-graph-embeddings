writes
personally
i
think
that
alomar
is
all
hype
he
is
producing
incredibly
now
but
in
the
long
run
he
will
never
put
up
the
numbers
that
sandberg
has
for
this
moment
alomar
may
be
the
best
but
overall
sandberg
wins
out
by
a
long
shot
when
sandberg
was
alomars
age
he
was
putting
up
seasons
with
no
power
alomars
oba
is
points
higher
than
sandbergs
career
high
alomars
career
high
in
doubles
and
triples
is
higher
than
sandbergs
sandberg
is
still
better
than
alomar
but
only
because
alomar
hasnt
reached
his
full
potential
yet
alomars
got
a
yearheadstart
on
sandberg
he
has
hits
sandberg
didnt
have
hits
until
he
was
and
is
likely
to
put
up
better
career
numbers
than
sandberg
in
everything
except
home
runs
hell
pass
sandberg
in
stolen
bases
sometime
in
sandberg
is
not
particulary
known
for
his
stolen
bases
what
competition
did
alomar
have
sandberg
came
in
a
year
after
ripken
and
the
same
year
as
boggs
gwynn
and
the
other
magicians
so
less
attention
was
given
to
sandberg
alomar
is
the
only
one
in
his
class
to
be
worth
a
mediocre
besides
the
numbers
dont
count
national
league
pitchers
are
much
better
pitchers
larry
