joe
torre
has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
thats
because
lankford
had
a
minor
injury
from
a
couple
of
games
before
that
and
was
daytoday
only
available
as
a
pinchrunner
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
see
above
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
torre
also
said
lankford
is
the
one
outfield
guy
whos
in
there
no
matter
what
my
guess
is
jordan
will
eventually
end
up
being
odd
man
out
due
to
low
on
base
percentage
whiten
was
a
great
acquisition
decent
offense
and
great
defense
in
rightfield
but
dont
worry
gilkey
will
be
starting
as
soon
as
jordan
or
whiten
displays
an
extended
period
of
low
offensive
output
