at
age
alomar
had
a
brilliant
rookie
year
true
he
was
limited
by
injuries
in
his
sophomore
season
but
his
numbers
both
that
yaer
and
the
year
following
were
quite
mediocre
this
season
the
same
bill
james
projects
a
ba
of
ops
of
the
same
bill
james
why
do
you
say
that
it
sounds
like
youre
suggesting
bill
james
had
something
to
do
with
overhyping
the
kid
to
death
au
contraire
he
was
fairly
critical
of
him
after
his
roy
campaign
noting
that
he
wasnt
allworld
as
a
catcher
or
a
hitter
he
called
him
basically
average
when
everyone
else
in
the
media
was
predicting
the
next
johnny
bench
or
roy
campanella
both
of
these
young
men
were
highly
touted
defensive
catchers
expected
to
be
among
the
best
ever
in
baseball
the
reports
i
read
indicate
that
lopez
is
very
ordinary
defensively
which
reports
are
those
the
dodgers
options
are
parrish
and
hernandez
and
now
only
carlos
piazza
is
as
long
as
he
continues
with
his
very
hot
bat
they
will
keep
him
in
the
lineup
because
they
need
the
offensive
production
when
he
cools
off
look
for
the
much
better
defensive
catcher
hernandez
only
to
play
more
i
like
hernandez
a
lot
but
if
piazza
can
catch
the
ball
youve
got
ta
play
him
imho
hes
a
much
better
hitter
although
hernandez
isnt
a
bad
hitter
right
now
it
sounds
like
piazza
will
catch
most
of
the
time
and
hernandez
will
be
candiottis
caddy
since
he
can
catch
the
knuckler
as
long
as
they
play
up
to
their
abilities
the
dodgers
could
have
a
very
good
catching
tandem
the
braves
options
are
berryhill
and
olson
i
agree
that
olson
is
nothing
special
but
i
do
think
berryhill
is
better
than
many
people
on
rsb
believe
but
both
the
braves
catchers
are
very
good
defensively
calling
a
game
blocking
the
plate
throwing
and
although
they
are
somewhat
weak
offenivsively
they
play
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
another
big
bat
i
think
both
are
overrated
defensively
see
nichols
law
of
catcher
defense
but
thats
something
thats
difficult
to
prove
or
disprove
from
your
viewpoint
or
mine
about
the
only
tangible
thing
we
can
look
at
is
opponents
sb
and
thats
clouded
by
how
well
your
pitchers
hold
runners
catchers
era
is
a
possibility
but
its
subject
to
way
too
many
biases
as
for
them
playing
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
another
big
bat
i
disagree
here
too
about
the
only
chink
in
the
braves
armor
is
that
theyre
weak
offensively
at
several
positions
cf
c
b
ss
if
belliard
plays
b
unless
bream
and
hunter
form
another
superplatoon
and
very
weak
defensively
if
blauser
plays
id
like
to
see
the
braves
give
at
least
one
of
mel
nieves
javy
lopez
or
chipper
jones
a
shot
but
much
like
the
talentrich
jays
of
recent
years
theyll
be
conservative
and
stick
with
what
they
have
im
not
saying
thats
wrong
just
conservative
dave
hung
like
a
jim

kirsch
blue
jays
do
it
again
in
new
quotes
out
of

not
