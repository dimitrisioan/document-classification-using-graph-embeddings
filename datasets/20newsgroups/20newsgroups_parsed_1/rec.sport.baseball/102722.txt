stay
in
school
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
learn
what
i
know
that
million
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
i
know
rickey
henderson
doesnt
have
a
career
out
of
baseball
i
know
if
he
didnt
have
baseball
he
wouldnt
be
making
near
the
money
he
is
now
i
just
dont
understand
how
some
athlete
who
only
plays
a
sport
for
a
living
for
millions
of
dollars
say
he
is
not
being
paid
enough
if
nobody
will
sign
him
for
his
asking
price
he
will
be
the
one
hurting
the
as
will
still
win
without
him
remeber
many
of
these
athletes
have
nothing
if
not
for
their
athletic
ability
nothing
they
are
getting
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
working
citizens
and
they
are
complaining
of
not
enough
pay
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
them
making
millions
my
problem
is
when
the
say
they
arent
being
paid
enough
when
they
already
get
millionalso
their
numbers
get
worse
