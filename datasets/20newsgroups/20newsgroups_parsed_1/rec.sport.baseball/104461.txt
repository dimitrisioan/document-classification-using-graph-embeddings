says

the
defenition
of
the
underdog
is
a
team
that
has
no
talent
and
comes
out
of
nowhere
to
contend
the
mets
and
orioles
are
prime
examples
not
the
cubs
sorry
but
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
win
a
division
with
no
talent
over
games
i
would
amend
your
definition
to
underdog
a
team
expected
to
lose
but
which
wins
thanks
to
underestimated
talent
dave
ok
the
mets
and
os
are
good
examples
but
what
about
the
reds
do
you
really
think
that
anyone
expected
them
to
sweep
the
as
i
know
people
who
didnt
even
think
theyd
win
a
game
let
alone
win
the
series
these
people
were
very
silly
any
team
that
gets
to
the
world
series
can
win
the
world
series
and
anybody
who
ever
expects
a
sweep
is
crazy
if
you
put
the
best
team
in
baseball
in
the
series
against
the
worst
team
in
baseball
the
worst
team
would
win
at
least
a
game
most
of
the
time
and
very
well
could
win
the
series
though
the
odds
would
certainly
be
against
them
