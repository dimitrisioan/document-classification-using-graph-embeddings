looking
for
strategic
boardgame
for
baseball
last
year
my
nine
year
old
son
fell
in
love
with
baseball
and
now
likes
to
play
and
to
follow
the
professionals
i
would
like
to
buy
him
a
board
game
so
he
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
and
practise
a
little
of
the
managerial
stragegy
i
am
not
looking
for
a
computer
game
or
any
type
of
game
where
manual
dexterity
determines
the
winner
i
am
after
something
that
he
and
his
friends
can
spread
out
over
a
table
on
a
rainy
day
and
spend
some
thoughtful
time
over
i
would
appreciate
the
names
of
any
recommended
games
i
dont
follow
this
newsgroup
so
email
responses
would
be
ideal
