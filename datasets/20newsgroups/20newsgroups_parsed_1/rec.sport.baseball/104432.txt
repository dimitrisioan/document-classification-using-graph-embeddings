re
and
americas
team
isbut
why
orin
roth
writes
well
officially
its
the
braves
at
least
up
until
they
started
winning
it
was
are
they
still
officially
if
so
why
and
how
did
they
receive
this
label
unoffically
but
without
a
doubt
americas
team
is
the
cubs
why
well
my
guess
is
because
america
loves
underdogs
every
year
no
matter
the
cubs
talent
or
the
predictions
they
never
as
close
to
never
as
possible
win
anything
over
the
years
as
the
losing
has
mounted
america
has
fallen
in
love
with
these
perennial
losers
the
cubs
have
more
fans
in
chicago
then
some
teams
do
worldwide
the
cubs
have
more
fans
worldwide
than
most
of
the
teams
in
their
division
combined
an
aura
of
excitement
surrounds
the
cubs
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
like
no
one
else
including
the
ws
champs
it
must
be
that
eternal
hope
this
is
the
year
theyve
got
the
talent
theyre
off
to
a
good
start
theyve
got
the
pitching
or
hitting
or
whatever
their
strong
point
is
at
the
time
its
that
inevitability
that
the
cubs
will
eventually
win
the
ws
again
when
only
god
knows
since
its
been
so
long
it
could
come
at
any
time
or
it
could
be
another
years
but
until
they
do
finally
win
and
start
winning
consistently
the
cubs
will
remain
americas
lovable
underdogs
the
cubs
areamericas
team
orin
bradley
u
the
defenition
of
the
underdog
is
a
team
that
has
no
talent
and
comes
out
of
nowhere
to
contend
the
mets
and
orioles
are
prime
examples
not
the
cubs
i
root
for
the
cubs
because
i
feel
sorry
for
them
but
basically
they
are
dogs
the
pirates
today
are
a
great
example
of
an
underdog
if
the
rockies
and
marlins
compete
they
will
be
underdogs
the
north
stars
trip
to
the
stanley
cup
finals
was
a
good
example
of
an
underdogs
journey
the
cubs
have
a
good
team
this
year
and
play
in
a
weak
division
they
are
much
less
than
americas
team
im
really
