fans
left
rbi
fans
and
runs
off
this
list
because
they
are
dependant
on
the
team
to
a
large
extent
if
frank
thomas
hit
first
hed
lose
a
lot
of
rbis
and
anyways
how
many
nd
place
hitters
have
you
known
to
drive
in
runs
doesnt
happen
that
oftenvery
unlikely
with
devon
whites
obp
in
front
of
you
im
pretty
sure
that
sandberg
has
done
this
at
least
once
i
know
someone
will
correct
me
if
im
wrong
rbis
and
runs
scored
are
the
two
most
important
offensive
statistics
you
can
talk
about
obp
and
slg
all
you
want
but
the
fact
remains
the
team
that
scores
more
runs
wins
the
game
right
so
who
cares
which
player
gets
credited
as
long
as
the
team
gets
more
runs
if
a
player
helps
the
team
get
more
r
and
rbi
but
doesnt
score
them
all
himself
who
cares
consider
player
a
single
player
b
grounder
to
short
reaches
on
the
force
at
nd
player
c
double
b
to
rd
player
d
sac
fly
b
gets
a
run
d
gets
an
rbi
are
you
sure
they
helped
the
team
more
than
a
and
c
think
hard
now
flame
away
as
you
wish
