i
dont
pretend
to
understand
statistical
analysis
well
we
agree
on
the
last
part
cool
and
thank
you
for
an
intelligent
response
devoid
of
the
silly
namecalling
of
others
one
of
the
basic
things
you
need
to
have
in
a
statistic
to
be
able
to
predict
a
players
performance
on
it
in
the
future
is
for
there
to
be
a
correlation
from
year
to
year
a
players
batting
average
is
correlated
fairly
well
from
year
to
year
ok
the
basic
problems
with
something
like
clutch
batting
average
overall
batting
average
is
that
the
correlation
from
year
to
year
is
almost
zero
adding
to
the
sample
size
doesnt
seem
to
help
much
actually
i
think
the
largescale
sample
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
players
in
baseball
in
regard
to
ba
vs
clutch
ba
deviation
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curve
the
xaxis
being
the
deviation
in
clutch
hitting
vs
nonclutch
the
yaxis
being
the
number
of
players
certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
as
a
counterexample
to
what
you
showed
consider
the
following
two
players
from
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
maldonado
lemon
if
you
had
had
these
two
players
in
by
your
logic
in
those
clutch
situations
youd
bat
maldonado
for
lemon
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
well
in
maldonado
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
while
lemon
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
before
you
accuse
me
of
completely
cooking
the
data
you
wont
hear
those
kind
of
accusations
from
me
it
is
interesting
that
you
selected
maldonado
because
he
is
someone
whom
i
have
also
looked
at
he
has
been
a
very
inconsistent
hitter
in
terms
of
ba
hitting
in
admittedly
he
has
been
traded
between
leagues
as
well
as
clubs
his
clutch
hitting
record
is
equally
inconsistent
so
for
my
purposes
in
i
would
not
draw
any
conclusions
about
his
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
based
on
his
prior
performance
i
dont
know
how
i
would
have
felt
in
but
you
may
indeed
be
right
when
i
looked
at
sabo
i
found
a
more
consistent
record
of
hitting
and
a
more
consistent
pattern
of
his
clutch
hitting
being
proportionately
below
his
nonclutch
ba
ditto
for
joe
carter
this
probably
brings
us
to
the
heart
of
the
disagreement
i
am
having
with
others
on
this
topic
must
any
conclusion
based
on
statistical
history
be
able
to
be
applied
broadly
throughout
a
data
base
before
it
has
any
validity
is
it
impossible
or
irrational
to
apply
statistical
analysis
to
selected
components
of
the
data
base
btw
correlating
players
overall
batting
average
from
with
gives
a
correlation
coefficient
of
which
is
significant
at
something
better
than
the
confidence
level
correlating
their
clutchnonclutch
ba
for
the
same
period
gives
a
correlation
of
significant
at
no
level
of
any
interest
i
completely
accept
that
reasoning
again
what
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
individuals
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
on
a
consistent
basis
actually
its
technically
incorrect
to
say
that
we
cant
predict
future
clutch
performance
its
more
correct
to
say
that
we
cant
predict
future
clutch
performance
with
any
skill
