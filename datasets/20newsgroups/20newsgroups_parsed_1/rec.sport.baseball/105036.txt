of
all
time
as
far
as
anyone
can
tell
i
did
a
quick
scan
last
night
looking
for
players
with
a
peak
comparable
to
or
better
than
winfield
in
my
quickndirty
subjective
judgement
you
could
make
good
cases
for
ruth
aaron
ott
robinson
clemente
kaline
maris
klein
jackson
waner
and
probably
a
few
others
this
is
not
a
knock
on
winfield
but
a
comment
on
his
consistency
all
of
those
other
players
had
awesome
stretches
and
very
good
stretches
while
winfield
has
been
more
uniformly
excellent
hall
of
fame
absolutely
top
peak
im
not
so
sure
top
total
career
value
yes
almost
certainly
point
taken
when
was
winfields
peak
years
anyway
probably
around
