for
some
reason
trying
to
come
up
with
names
of
jewish
baseball
players
past
and
present
we
werent
able
to
come
up
with
much
except
for
sandy
koufax

maybe
john
lowenstein
can
anyone
come
up
with
any
more

know
it
sounds
pretty
lame
to
be
racking
our
brains
over
this
but
humor
us
thanks
for
your
help
hank
greenberg
would
have
to
be
the
most
famous
because
his
jewish
faith
actually
affected
his
play
missing
late
season
or
was
it
world
series
games
because
of
yom
kippur

the
other
hand

jewish
as

a
nohitter

an
era
title
in
or
so
before
blowing
out

stanky
jewish
or

that
just
a
dave
cohen

misinterpretation

look
like
