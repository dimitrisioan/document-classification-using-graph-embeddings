we
are
using
pkzip
v
and
i
am
interested
to
hear
from
people
who
have
used
one
of
the
many
windows
programs
that
call
these
which
ones
are
available
and
does
any
one
stand
out
amongst
the
rest
well
i
got
winzip
from
cica
dont
know
which
version
but
i
think
its
the
latest
as
this
is
not
long
ago
and
i
was
initially
imressed
but
heres
the
lowdown
winzip
is
a
great
progra
as
long
as
you
only
unzip
it
lets
you
vew
files
unzip
only
selected
files
and
even
puts
the
files
in
a
checkout
directory
and
creates
a
checkout
grp
and
group
if
you
want
to
check
the
program
out
it
even
prompts
for
deletion
of
these
on
exit
if
you
didnt
like
the
program
however
big
however
over
here
i
have
problems
zipping
i
dont
konw
specifics
on
this
or
ammount
of
consistency
but
sometimes
when
i
zip
a
few
files
or
add
a
file
to
a
zip
dos
will
violate
something
or
other
and
ill
be
asked
in
a
kind
microoft
kind
of
way
to
quit
all
applications
quit
windows
and
restart
my
computer
i
dont
know
as
i
said
how
consistent
this
is
as
i
jdont
zip
much
and
when
i
do
now
i
just
go
to
dos
and
use
it
from
there
or
just
use
the
run
cmd
but
i
do
know
its
happened
when
i
added
files
to
an
existing
zip
file
and
when
i
created
a
new
zip
file
using
selected
files
only
i
dont
know
if
its
happened
when
i
zip
an
entire
dir
still
it
has
a
rather
nice
interface
and
quite
useful
unziping
functions
if
the
above
is
fixed
ill
be
the
first
to
register
the
new
ver
as
for
now
a
good
old
rununzip
zip
will
work
ps
if
a
new
ver
is
out
that
fixes
these
please
let
me
know
peace
