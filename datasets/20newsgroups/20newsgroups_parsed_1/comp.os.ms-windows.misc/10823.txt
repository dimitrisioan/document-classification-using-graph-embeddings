wanted
synopsis
i
wrote
can
anyone
tell
me
where
i
can
find
an
mswindows
truetype
font
that
will
give
me
the
characters
used
in
writing
irishgaelic
in
the
old
style
for
example
in
this
font
the
letter
t
would
look
something
like
a
c
with
a
horizontal
bar
sitting
on
the
top
and
the
letter
g
would
look
something
like
an
s
with
a
horizontal
bar
sitting
on
the
top
many
thanks
to
those
who
responded
to
my
question
unfortunately
i
have
had
no
luck
in
actually
getting
such
a
font
and
a
lot
of
people
interested
in
geting
one
and
so
i
have
decided
to
create
my
own
truetype
font
fitting
that
description
this
font
is
based
on
that
used
in
the
issue
of
dineens
dictionary
and
is
typical
of
that
found
in
irish
books
from
the
early
part
of
the
century
this
may
take
me
some
time
to
do
in
my
limited
spare
time
but
ill
make
it
available
to
anyone
who
is
interested
when
it
is
ready
the
responses
i
received
are
summerised
below
kevin
donnelly
mentioned
that
michael
everson
had
developed
some
clo
gaelach
fonts
for
the
macintosh
and
may
be
able
to
advise
me
i
contacted
michael
and
he
told
me
that
he
has
three
fonts
available
for
the
macintosh
and
that
he
will
eventually
port
them
to
the
pc
but
that
he
will
be
charging
ir
about
for
each
one
mentioned
that
he
uses
two
font
that
have
a
nice
irishgaelic
look
to
them
these
are
durrow
and
american
uncialnormal
i
dont
know
where

looking
for
