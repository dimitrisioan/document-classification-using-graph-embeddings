is
there
any
utility
available
that
will
make
windows
randomly
select
one
of
your
windows
directorys
bmp
files
as
the
wallpaper
file
there
are
a
couple
i
am
personally
using
screenpeace
which
is
a
if
you
need
just
to
change
the
wallpaper
then
ive
written
a
short
program
in
vb
that
does
this
by
using
systemparametersinfofunction
the
bad
news
is
that
you
need
vbrundll
to
run
it
and
the
dll
is
some
kb
the
program
is
about
kb
the
order
of
pictures
depends
on
the
system
date
and
the
number
of
bmpfiles
in
the
directory
so
the
picture
remains
the
same
if
you
execute
the
program
multiple
times
during
the
same
day
and
the
number
of
bmps
has
not
changed
if
you
feel
this
is
what
you
need
then
i
could
uuencode
it
and
email
it
to
you
it
is
unavailable
via
ftp
