c
libraries
well
im
amazed
at
how
successful
this
exercise
was
i
received
responses
and
requests
for
summary
thanks
to
everyone
who
made
it
possible
on
my
own
i
was
able
to
find
out
about
codebase
accsys
and
qe
codebase
and
accsys
are
c
libraries
without
sql
qe
is
a
windows
application
that
can
be
communicated
through
windows
dde
calls
where
you
send
a
sql
string
and
receive
the
results
most
people
wrote
to
tell
me
about
the
paradox
engine
from
borland
other
products
mentioned
were
microsofts
odbc
accsys
quadbase
codebase
rbase
and
qe
only
odbc
quadbase
rbase
and
qe
have
sql
for
myself
i
decided
on
codebase
mostly
because
it
has
an
ansi
c
portability
version
that
runs
under
dos
unix
etc
and
includes
the
source
code
and
portability
is
important
in
my
application
it
works
with
dbase
foxpro
or
clipper
files
however
i
feel
that
microsofts
odbc
looks
very
promising
its
mostly
a
formalisation
of
building
and
submitting
sql
queries
and
formatting
query
results
as
the
responses
say
its
available
via
ftp
except
its
effectively
unusuable
without
two
manuals
the
odbc
programmers
reference
and
the
odbc
sdk
guide
moreover
odbc
doesnt
actually
interpret
sql
and
liase
with
databases
thats
up
to
drivers
that
should
be
provided
by
database
manufacturers
also
its
windows
only
its
actually
an
extension
to
the
windows
sdk
nevertheless
its
a
start
at
a
sql
interface
standard
and
should
make
life
interesting
in
the
future
heres
my
original
post
followed
by
the
responses
separated
by
a
line
of
asterisks
does
anyone
know
if
borland
or
microsoft
have
libraries
for
accessing
their
respective
databases
paradox
foxpro
from
within
c
programs
id
really
like
to
be
able
to
build
a
sql
query
string
and
pass
it
to
a
function
which
returns
the
query
results
in
some
format
failing
that
any
other
access
would
still
be
better
than
nothing
id
also
like
to
hear
of
third
party
libraries
for
doing
the
same
thing
if
other
people
are
interested
ill
prepare
a
summary
of
what
im
told
and
post
it
thanks
to
all
borland
has
a
product
called
paradox
engine
that
does
just
what
you
want
the
current
version
is
which
is
fully
compatible
with
ack
paradox
why
the
versions
are
different
i
dont
know
pd
engine
was
compatible
with
pdox
and
it
consists
of
a
rather
broad
library
of
functions
for
accesing
database
files
from
both
pascal
i
think
turbo
pascal
and
up
and
c
i
think
either
microsoft
or
borland
now
reading
the
box
its
borland
paradox
engine
database
frameworks
works
with
any
borland
cc
mocrosoft
c
or
later
turbo
c
for
windows
turbo
pascal
or
later
tp
for
windows
or
later
for
framework
applications
bc
or
later
or
ms
cc
it
does
have
support
for
object
useage
i
havent
had
a
real
chance
to
really
use
it
myself
but
it
looks
fairly
complete
im
planning
to
use
it
this
summer

borland

a
product
which
is
called

engine
i
do
not
know
about
ms
the
paradox
engine
i
know
very
well
and
it
definitiely
not
a
replacement
for
sql
but
it
will
enable
you
to
save

restore

borland

a

for
accessing

from
within
a

they
recently
came
out
with
version
this

ms
has
put
their

into

its
big
i
believe
mb
but
worth
downloading
over
a
fast
link
look
at
ftpuunet
in
vendormicrosoftodbcsdk
also
some
companies
are
starting
to
provide
sql
engines
i
just
got
one
for
rbase
not
exactly
cheap
at
but
it
allows
programs
in
c
or
vbasic
under
dos
or
windows
to
talk
to
data
bases
using
sql
functions
in
your

earl

i
actualy
have
paradox
engine
it
is
a
library
of
functions
large
model
for
accessing
the
paradoxs
databases
it
seems
to
be
working
fine
but
i
never
did
try
it
thouroughly
it
costs
hope
it
will
help
you
from
david
lefebvre
borland
provides
a
database
lib
called
paradox
engine
which
can
access
and
use
the
database

is
the
library
for
paradox
artur
babecki
borland
sells
the
paradox
engine
which
has
all
the
paradox
calls
in
it
its
hardly
sql
though
you
can
do
searches
on
key
fields
and
on
indivual
fields
but
no
comparison
operators
like
so
its
pretty
painful
in
my
opinion
do
do
anything
besides
simple
retrieval
and
insertsupdates
im
currently
using
it
i
have
an
eval
copy
and
ive
linked
it
in
to
some
entry
screens
ive
written
the
engine
library
adds
about
k
to
the
size
of
the
program
but
you
can
load
it
as
an
overlay
using
borlands
vroom
manager
now
borland
claims
that
later
versions
of
the
engine
will
have
sql
support
but
they
dont
really
expect
it
till
late
in
the
year
or
even
next
year
they
are
trying
to
get
thrid
parties
to
help
out
if
you
have
any
other
questions
let
me
know
mike
kamlet
yes
borland
sells
their
paradox
engine
separately
it
has
c
c
and
pascal
interfaces
although
the
underlying
interface
is
in
c
well
at
least
for
version
of
the
engine
which
i
have
costed
at
egghead
they
now
have
version
of
the
engine
and
a
separate
c
class
package
for
it

ive
used
accsys
for

new
version
is
almost
ready
for
paradox
to
access
paradox
files
from
c
its
pretty
good
not
sql
though
have
heard
of
borland
paradox
engine
or
some
such
which
is
supposed
to
do
likewise
but
not
sure
of
what
it
is
exactly
hope
this
helps
good
luck

borland

i

it
comes
with

libraries
as
well
the
c

come
in
both
dos
and
windows
flavors
the
win
stuff
being
dlls
when
i
got
it
it
also
came
with
crystal
reports
which
is
a
graphical
report
generator
it
allows
you
to
create
a
generic
form
and
use
it
within
a
compiled
program
using
pdox
engine
i
dont
know
if
they
still
offer
it
or
what
the
current
price
is
i
paid
something
like
for
an
upgrade
from
the
earlier
version
though
hope
this
helps

it
is
easier
to
change
the

specification
to
fit
the

than
viceversa
and
author
unknown
but
very
wise
if
you
want
to
do
sql
from
within
your

check
out

to

i
have
a
background
in

in

this
looked
real
similar
its
a
little
expensive
but
if
you
order
the
demo
and
then
just
wait
they
will
probably
send
you
a
special

thatll

borland

but
for

i
believe
youd
have
buy
have
the
sql
link
since
pdox
itself
isnt
sql
compliant
ive
used
the
engine
for
over
a
year
now
and
have
been
pretty
satisfied
with
it
under

its

there

paradox
engine
provides
a
complete
set
of
c
libraries
for
accessing

tables
however
it
seems
that
it
supports
only
borlandturbo
c
and
microsoft
c
when
i
tried
to
compile
the
engines
sample
applications
with
the
waterloo
watcom
cc
bit
compiler
it
complains
that
the
library
file
llibcelib
is
missing
even
though
i
am
quite
certain
that
the
file
is
not
part
of
watcom
c
or
the
engine
anybody
have
any
success
with
other
c
compilers
im
currently
developing
an
app
with
borlands
paradox
engine
for
c
it
also
comes
in
pascal
which
has
recently
gone
to
version
ie
px
engine
is
compatible
with
paradox
and
downward
compat
w
there
are
indeed
c
libs
for
fox
access
but
i
cant
think
of
the
names
offhand
im
sure
someone
has
already
written
you
in
that
regard
i
think
i
just
saw
an
add
for
a
fox
lib
in
the
c
users
journal
which
is
a
good
place
to
look
for
this
type
of
package
in
general
by
the
way
ive
been
paying
my
dues
to
learn
a
lot
of
the
quirks
of
px
eng
over
the
past
year
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
a
complex
multiuser
appbut
im
staying
with
it
for
nowits
like
a
bad
marriage
ive
got
too
much
time
invested
in
learning
and
workarounds
but
if
your
interest
is
limited
to
a
simple
singleuser
interface
you
want
to
build
your
own
sql
engine
i
take
it
px
engine
will
do
the
job
easily
it
doesnt
sound
like
youll
be
bumping
into
any
of
the
gotchas

you

may
be
able
