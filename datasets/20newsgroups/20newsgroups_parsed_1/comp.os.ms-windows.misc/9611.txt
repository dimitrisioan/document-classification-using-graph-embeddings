re
borlands
paradox
offer
i
am
considering
buying
borlands
paradox
for
windows
since
i
would
like
to
use
a
database
with
windows
i
dont
haveuse
one
yet
for
both
workhome
use
i
would
like
to
advantage
of
borlands
until
april
offer
if
this
package
is
everything
that
borland
claims
it
to
be
so
i
was
wondering
has
anybody
used
this
andor
have
any
opinions
tom
belmonte
ive
been
using
ms
access
still
available
from
some
stores
for
and
i
am
quite
pleased
with
it
its
relatively
easy
to
learn
very
easy
to
use
and
somewhat
easy
to
program
i
highly
recomend
it
particularly
at
i
have
not
used
paradox
for
windows
but
i
dont
expect
it
to
be
better
than
access
imho
