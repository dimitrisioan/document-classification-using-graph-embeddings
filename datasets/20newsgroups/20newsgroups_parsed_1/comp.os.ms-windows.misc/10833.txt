which
is
trivially
true
that
it
is

inferior
in

what
criteria
have
you
chosen
for
your
objective
assesment
are
you
sure
that
these
criteria
are
themselves
objective
i
have
begun
to
learn
in
life
that
the
masses
never
choose
the
best
option
available
to
them
they
choose
the
one
which
they
have
been
conditioned
to
think
is
best
im
glad
im
not
one
