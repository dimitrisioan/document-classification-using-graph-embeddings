is
supposed
to
read
and
write
mac
disks
ive
never
tried
it
though
good
luck
i
just
tried
it
but
i
cant
say
that
it
works
cause
it
doesnt
read
k
disks
it
only
reads
mb
if
there
a
program
that
does
read
k
disks
please
let
me
know
im
not
sure
that
this
is
possible
due
to
the
way
the
mac
writes
the
k
disk
i
think
the
way
the
sectors
are
set
up
are
different
enough
that
a
pc
cant
read
it
this
is
a
hardware
problem
which
software
can
not
correct
hope
this
helps
and
correct
me
if
im
wrong
youre
right
you
can
not
read
or
write
a
mac
or
apple
ii
k
disk
or
apple
ii
disk
without
extra
hardware
however
mac
mb
disks
can
be
read
and
written
in
a
pc
hd
drive
with
software
only
this
should
probably
be
added
to
every
pc
and
mac
faq
file
it
sure
gets
asked
enough
