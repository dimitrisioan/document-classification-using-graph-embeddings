apparently
not
many
people
complain
about
the
confusion
that
results
from
the
filemanagerprogman
split
its
just
a
basic
flaw
i
have
one
thing
to
say
why
does
everyone
say
that
spliting
them
up
is
such
a
bad
thing
i
actually
like
my
program
launcher
and
file
manager
do
be
seperate
it
make
things
easier
to
figure
out
i
mean
take
a
look
at
oss
wps
no
flames
i
personally
hate
it
cause
i
just
have
too
much
trouble
figuring
out
how
to
do
simple
things
like
file
copy
and
dont
say
just
drag
the
icon
cause
i
hate
icons
in
the
first
place
i
have
too
much
trouble
telling
what
all
those
little
push
buttons
mean
i
want
file
copy
etc
although
i
know
im
in
the
minority
no
disclaimeri
blame
everything
on
someone
else
