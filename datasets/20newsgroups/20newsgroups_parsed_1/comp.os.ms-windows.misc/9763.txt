i
have
a
with
megs
of
memory
i
have
noticed
that
lately
when
i
use
programs
like
wpfw
or
corel
draw
my
computer
boggs
down
and
becomes
really
sluggish
what
can
i
do
to
increase
performance
what
should
i
turn
on
or
off
will
not
loading
wallpapers
or
stuff
like
that
help
when
it
comes
to
the
running
speed
of
windows
and
the
programs
that
run
under
it
thanx
in
advance
derek
make
sure
your
hard
drive
is
defragmented
this
will
speed
up
more
than
just
windows
btw
use
something
like
nortons
or
pc
tools
i
think
that
leaving
the
wall
paper
out
will
use
less
ram
and
therefore
will
speed
up
your
machine
but
i
could
very
will
be
wrong
on
this
theres
a
good
chance
youve
already
done
this
but
if
not
it
may
speed
things
up
good
luck
