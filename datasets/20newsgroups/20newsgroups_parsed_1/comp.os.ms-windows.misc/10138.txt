we
are
using
pkzip
v
and
i
am
interested
to
hear
from
people
who
have
used
one
of
the
many
windows
programs
that
call
these
which
ones
are
available
and
does
any
one
stand
out
amongst
the
rest
is
there
a
full
windows
version
that
does
not
call
the
dos
pkzippkunzip
commands
yes
russ
there
is
quinzip
is
a
windows
version
but
i
dont
think
it
handles
all
the
functions
available
in
the
dos
version
the
problem
is
that
quinzip
is
very
very
slow
so
i
think
that
winzip
is
still
the
best
choice
to
use
pkzip
in
windows
