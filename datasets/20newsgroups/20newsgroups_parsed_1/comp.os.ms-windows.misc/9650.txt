setting
up
threeuser
accounting
system
with
wfwg
i
am
a
novice
at
best
in
working
with
pc
networks
and
am
in
the
process
of
planning
a
small
accounting
system
for
a
small
business
the
particular
need
in
this
case
is
for
three
machines
each
in
a
different
office
of
the
same
building
each
having
access
to
a
windowsbased
accounting
system
my
first
thought
is
to
set
up
ms
windows
for
workgroups
on
each
of
the
machines
likely
a
and
two
s
along
with
the
appropriate
ethernet
cards
and
cabling
that
come
with
the
windows
for
workgroups
starter
kit
one
additional
user
kit
will
be
necessary
it
then
seems
logical
to
purchase
a
simple
multiuser
accounting
system
along
the
lines
of
daceasy
or
myob
and
fire
it
all
up
the
will
more
or
less
act
as
server
with
a
reportcheck
printer
attached
to
it
cable
runs
of
feet
will
be
necessary
for
this
setup
well
this
all
seems
too
easy
to
me
would
any
of
you
network
gurus
out
there
tell
me
if
i
am
out
of
my
mind
here
any
and
all
suggestions
however
trivial
will
be
immensely
appreciated
my
apologies
if
this
has
been
brought
up
before
thanks
