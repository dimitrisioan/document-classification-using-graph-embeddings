is
there
any
ftp
site
that
carries
winbench
results
for
different
graphics
cards
in
excel
xls
format
what
is
the
latest
version
of
winbench
and
how
do
they
differ
is
the
source
available
and
has
anybody
try
to
port
it
to
xwindow
at
least
in
a
way
that
will
make
comparisons
possible
on
ftpcicaindianaedu
in
pubpcwinmiscwinadvzip
is
a
writeup
by
steve
gibson
of
infoworld
with
winbench
and
a
number
of
other
benchmark
results
for
nine
isa
and
four
vlb
video
cards
this
is
a
very
current
upload
and
is
likely
to
have
any
card
youre
currently
giving
serious
consideration
not
in
xls
format
latest
version
of
winbench
that
i
know
of
is
ver
i
believe
they
try
to
maintain
the
same
rating
scale
between
versions
and
new
versions
are
released
to
defeat
the
lastest
coding
tricks
put
in
by
driver
programmers
to
beat
the
benchmarks
dont
know
on
the
last
one
and
why
they
are
considering
using
winbench
as
a
test
they
may
want
to
read
everything
steve
gibson
has
said
on
the
subject
in
his
infoworld
column
the
past
couple
of
month
in
short
virtually
every
board
manufacturer
cheats
on
the
test
by
writing
things
in
the
driver
that
is
there
only
to
make
the
board
appear
faster
on
the
winbench
suite
so
the
winbench
score
has
no
bearing
in
reality
to
how
cards
stack
up
on
real
world
tasks
in
the
last
pcmagazine
they
benchmarked
some
of
the
new
accelerators
and
admitted
that
many
of
them
cheated
on
winbench
interestingly
they
allowed
one
type
of
cheating
behaviour
caching
for
bitblt
operations
no
matter
how
unreal
yet
did
not
allow
a
couple
of
other
types
of
cheating
behaviour
that
some
of
the
cards
used
at
least
one
card
was
eliminated
from
the
editors
choice
because
of
cheating
on
the
benchmark
