re
win
nt
what
is
it
i
have
little
info
on
chicago
so
i
cant
make
a
comparison
is
it
in
beta
is
there
anyone
out
there
who
has
tested
both
and
cares
to
make
a
comparison
just
my
aln
chicago
from
what
i
have
read
is
projected
to
run
in
m
on
and
higher
it
is
definitely
aimed
at
the
desktop
it
is
rumored
to
offer
preemptive
multitasking
multithreading
but
will
not
offer
multiprocessing
is
bit
and
no
reliance
on
dos
it
is
rumored
to
have
an
integrated
file
and
program
manager
dos
is
rumored
to
be
similar
to
chicago
but
without
the
gui
is
also
a
step
towards
cairo
the
next
generation
os
which
is
rumored
to
be
object
oriented
i
wonder
where
windows
fits
here
is
it
a
stepping
stone
to
chicago
hope
this
helps
thx
