we
are

v
and
i
am
interested
to
hear
from
people
who
have
used
one
of
the
many
windows
programs
that
call
these
is
there
a
full
windows
version
that
does
not
call

winzip
ftpcicaindianaedupubpcwinutil
it
is
a
shell
it
does
call
dos
but
a
very
very
good
one
it
will
also
do
arc
arj
and
lzh
it
fully
supports
pkzip
try
using
it
it
might
be
a
shell
very
unobtrusive
but
that
also
means
you
dont
need
to
update
it
with
every
everyotherletterofthealphabet
version
of
pkzip
hope
it
helps
