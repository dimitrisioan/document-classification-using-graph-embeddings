the
numbers
are
in
percentage
and
are
in
a
decreasing
order
what
does
this
table
tells
you
if
you
frequently
start
and
exit
a
program
that
doesnt
give
back
all
of
its
resources
then
you
continually
lose
these
resouces
therefore
only
open
these
programs
up
once
and
leave
them
open
btw
maybe
people
can
add
to
this
list
so
we
know
what
application
to
watch
out
for
later
