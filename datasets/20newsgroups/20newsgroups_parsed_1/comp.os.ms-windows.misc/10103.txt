re
why
im
not
using
dos
anymore
regarding
the
horror
stories
about
dosdoubledisk
and
stacker
killing
hard
drives
i
was
wondering
if
the
dos
mirror
command
works
on
the
doubled
drive
info
as
well
as
the
normal
fat
table
and
partition
table
if
it
records
the
vital
doubledisk
info
then
using
it
daily
should
go
a
long
way
toward
protecting
yourself
against
the
type
of
catastrophic
failure
discussed
if
it
doesnt
then
shame
on
microsoft
