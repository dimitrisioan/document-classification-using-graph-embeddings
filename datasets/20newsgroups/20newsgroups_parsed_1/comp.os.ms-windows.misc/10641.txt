for

nt
is
there
an
alternative
to
the
archane
fairly
useless
dos
batch
programming
language
for
os
ibm
introduced
the
rexx
language
as
an
alternative
to
bat
surely
windows
nt
should
do
the
same
thing
right
in
lieu
of
the
above
is
there
any
way
to
escape
the
crlf
in
a
bat
file
and
continue
a
single
command
across
multiple
lines
i
have
an
application
which
exits
to
the
system
and
submits
a
batch
file
the
batch
file
is
created
on
the
fly
from
sitespecific
code
stored
within
the
application
as
currently
designed
the
line
length
for
the
stored
code
and
the
output
file
bat
file
is
characters
which
is
not
enough
for
all
the
options
that
must
be
specified
on
a
particular
command
it
would
help
tremendously
if
i
didnt
have
to
redesign
my
code
to
kludge
around
the
lack
of
a
true
batchshell
programming
language
rest
deleted
as
a
followup
to
my
post
let
me
add
that
im
not
really
a
windows
or
windows
nt
user
so
please
excuse
my
ignorance
however
im
a
developer
at
sas
institute
and
one
component
of
the
application
that
i
support
is
the
ability
to
submit
a
sas
batch
job
from
within
an
interactive
sas
session
the
user
site
can
enter
their
sitespecific
batch
profile
into
a
dataset
within
our
product
specifying
the
pathname
to
the
sas
executable
specifying
site
specific
sas
options
etc
at
run
time
certain
variables
are
resolved
and
the
resolved
file
is
written
to
an
external
ascii
file
then
i
exit
to
the
operating
system
and
run
the
job
asynchronously
returning
to
the
interactive
session
as
soon
as
the
job
is
submitted
the
batch
job
then
runs
concurrently
with
the
interactive
session
as
currently
designed
the
internal
dataset
has
a
record
length
of
characters
but
to
run
the
batch
job
the
command
to
reinvoke
sas
in
batch
mode
requires
more
than
characters
up
til
nt
this
has
not
been
a
problem
since
every
job
controlshell
language
up
til
nt
eg
mvscmsvmsunixos
had
a
way
to
escape
the
crlf
and
enter
a
single
command
across
multiple
lines
os
via
their
rexx
language
which
is
standard
with
os
the
gist
of
all
this
is
since
this
application
is
for
endusers
not
within
my
company
i
have
to
try
to
develop
this
process
using
native
nt
since
my
first
posting
ive
learned
that
there
are
several
third
party
companies
that
provide
alternative
script
languages
for
windowswindows
nt
and
im
sure
a
company
that
licenses
our
product
would
use
that
alternative
script
language
if
they
had
it
but
i
cant
develop
under
the
assumption
that
they
have
anything
other
than
what
comes
with
nt
i
saw
another
post
on
this
list
the
subject
was
something
like
is
vi
available
for
windows
in
which
someone
said
that
vi
make
awk
and
ksh
was
available
with
microsoft
toolkit
what
is
that
product
is
it
a
separate
product
or
part
of
windows
ksh
would
do
what
i
need
if
i
could
count
on
it
at
all
nt
sites
one
last
question
ive
heard
that
nt
has
remote
processing
capabilities
ie
i
could
shove
this
batch
job
off
to
a
server
machine
and
have
it
run
there
if
these
are
native
nt
commands
rather
than
network
specific
commands
this
would
also
help
me
improve
this
process
if
you
can
comment
on
these
commands
i
would
appreciate
it
thanks
again
for
the
help
