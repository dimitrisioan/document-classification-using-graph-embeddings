on
my
pc
i
almost
exclusively
run
windows
the
only
dos
based
application
i
have
is
procommplus
in
my
configsys
i
have
emm
loaded
with
the
option
noems
no
expanded
memory
following
a
thread
in
one
of
the
comp
newsgroups
i
read
that
it
was
no
necessary
to
have
emm
loaded
indeed
in
the
manual
it
says
that
emm
is
used
to
get
expanded
memory
out
of
extended
memory
since
i
have
the
noems
option
it
seems
to
me
that
the
emm
device
is
useless
in
my
case
should
i
use
emm
or
should
i
remove
it
from
my
configsys
thanks
for
your
help
eric
emm
noems
enables
the
system
to
use
the
upper
memory
between
and
thats
a
good
place
for
device
drivers
dos
kernal
etc
keep
it
in
well
i
thought
that
highmemsys
would
do
that
too
i
just
took
out
emm
of
my
configsys
and
im
still
loading
my
other
drivers
high
mouse
vga
shadow
bios
doskey
etc
i
havent
checked
memc
but
i
believe
i
have
managed
to
load
them
high
ie
between
kb
and
kb
also
ever
since
i
took
out
emm
windows
loads
slightly
faster
i
get
about
extra
meg
of
freemem
in
windows
im
running
enhanced
with
meg
ram
meg
swap
and
i
got
rid
of
my
ctrlalt
del
reboot
problem
before
the
computer
would
not
reboot
using
ctrlaltdel
after
exiting
windows
i
would
really
like
to
keep
emm
out
of
my
configsys
