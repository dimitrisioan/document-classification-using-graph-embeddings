not
true
the
characters
in
a
tt
or
type
font
depend
on
the
maker
if
someone
converts
a
type
font
to
tt
theyll
only
get
the
characters
in
the
font
of
orgin
tt
allows
for
much
more
flexibility
in
this
area
as
well
you
can
have
thousands
of
glyphs
in
a
tt
font
file
macpswindowsunicode
char
set
and
use
the
characters
appropriate
for
the
particular
platform
you
are
running
the
font
on
well
yes
both
type
and
truetype
fonts
can
contain
lots
of
characters
and
in
both
cases
plain
text
fonts
will
be
reencoded
to
windows
ansi
in
windows
and
to
mac
standard
roman
encoding
on
the
mac
no
difference
there
between
t
and
tt
and
as
for
fonts
with
thousands
of
glyphs
right
know
these
are
a
liabiliaty
rather
than
a
great
new
thing
reason
is
that
a
font
with
characters
is
very
large
and
if
you
can
only
access
of
them
you
are
paying
a
heavy
price
in
downloading
time
and
printer
storage
and
at
the
moment
there
is
only
one
program
of
that
uses
partial
font
downloading
for
instance
all
or
our
fontpack
tt
fonts
have
the
macwindows
char
set
in
them
the
metrics
of
the
fonts
are
such
that
if
the
font
is
brought
over
to
the
mac
the
user
will
have
access
to
the
full
mac
char
set
yes
and
t
text
fonts
all
have
the
iso
adobe
character
set
which
is
a
superset
of
windows
ansi
and
macintosh
standard
roman
enocding
the
question
is
whether
you
can
get
at
the
glyphs
in
windows
for
example
you
can
not
get
at
the
ligatures
fi
anfd
fl
both
t
and
tteven
though
a
font
may
very
well
have
them
and
while
it
is
somewhat
painful
to
reencode
a
type
font
and
to
create
a
new
windows
metric
file
pfm
for
it
there
are
utilities
out
there
to
allow
you
do
this
how
do
i
reencode
a
truetype
font
how
can
i
get
at
the
fi
and
fl
ligatures
in
windows
or
on
the
mac
are
there
utilities
that
make
it
possible
to
circumvent
the
hardwired
