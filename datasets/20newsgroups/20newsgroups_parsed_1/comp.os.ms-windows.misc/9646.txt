quicken
vs
tobias
managing
your
money
i
just
got
a
copy
of
tobias
managing
your
money
v
i
have
quicken
and
its
wonderful
for
some
things
but
mym
seems
to
have
some
features
that
q
doesnt
for
example
q
doesnt
seem
to
be
able
to
handle
monthly
automatic
deductions
from
a
checking
account
you
know
a
monthly
payment
that
gets
electronically
deducted
every
month
from
my
checking
account
or
is
there
something
that
im
not
doing
right
and
q
can
actually
do
that
anyway
mym
seems
to
be
able
to
handle
monthly
deductions
in
fact
it
can
apparently
do
better
than
that
that
is
you
can
specify
monthly
bimonthly
quarterly
even
yearly
anyway
is
anyone
aware
of
a
comparitive
study
of
the
two
programs
or
can
someone
just
give
me
their
own
personal
impressions
maybe
someone
who
has
used
both
or
maybe
someone
who
is
familiar
with
each
could
give
me
a
capsule
review
anything
would
be
greatly
appreciated
if
i
keep
mym
i
have
to
pay
for
it
and
i
dont
know
whether
its
worth
doing
if
mym
is
better
than
q
of
course
i
will
keep
it
but
if
q
can
do
everything
mym
can
do
maybe
even
better
i
wont
thanks
all
if
you
post
a
reply
please
also
cc
me
thanks
