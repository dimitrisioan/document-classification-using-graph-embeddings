i
recently
purchased
a
diamond
stealth
isa
graphics
accelerator
card
based
upon
a
positive
review
by
steve
gibson
of
infoworld
although
its
fast
i
find
its
windows
drivers
extremely
buggy
despite
implementing
all
of
the
diamond
technical
support
suggestions
does
anyone
else
have
any
experience
with
this
card
any
feedback
appreciated
i
have
had
a
lot
of
problems
with
it
i
belive
i
have
the
latest
drivers
for
it
there
are
some
occasions
when
i
fire
up
windows
it
works
great
if
you
ever
find
newer
drivers
i
would
appreciate
a
pointer
to
there
location
