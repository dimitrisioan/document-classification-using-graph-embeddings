object
appears
thrice
hey
alli
got
an
equation
editor
and
since
it
didnt
automagically
appear
in
my
object
dialog
box
ie
insertobjectequation
i
decided
to
manually
place
it
there
so
i
went
into
winini
is
there
another
way
to
do
this
the
embedding
section
and
added
equationequationequationpathfilenamepicture
didnt
work
quit
windows
go
back
aha
mistake
correct
it
it
looks
fine
start
windowsdoesnt
work
play
with
it
for
a
while
at
one
point
having
two
entries
to
see
if
one
works
and
thother
dont
and
finally
i
get
it
to
work
the
only
thing
i
can
see
thats
different
now
is
that
its
now
the
first
item
on
the
list
and
it
used
to
be
the
last
but
now
i
end
up
with
three
equation
entried
and
all
of
them
working
and
only
one
entry
in
winini
so
does
any
netian
know
whats
wrong
or
rather
how
to
correct
this
ie
make
equationappear
but
once
also
all
the
entries
in
the
embedding
appear
as
above
its
obvious
that
pathfilename
is
the
executable
or
whatever
and
picture
has
something
to
do
withthe
way
it
appears
picturedescription
but
what
are
the
others
ie
in
soundrecsoundsound
whates
the
difference
between
the
st
sound
and
the
nd
and
what
is

i
dont
think
its
the
name
of
the
executable
as
other
entries
eg
