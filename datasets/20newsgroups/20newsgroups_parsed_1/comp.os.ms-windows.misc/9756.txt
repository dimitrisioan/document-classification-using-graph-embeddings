writes
can
someone
out
there
tell
me
how
to
switch
windows
screen
resolution
quickly
and
easily
i
know
that
i
can
go
back
into
install
to
do
it
but
what
id
really
like
is
to
have
is
the
ability
to
just
change
a
couple
of
startup
or
configuration
files
and
have
the
resolution
changed
i
already
have
both
video
drivers
that
i
need
on
my
system
so
that
isnt
a
problem
thanks
