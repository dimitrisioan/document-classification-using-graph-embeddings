and

in
article

i
would
be
very
appreciative
if
someone
would
answer
a
few
questions
about
windows
for
workgroups
i
currently
have
novell
netware
lite
which
does
not
work
with
windows
very
well
and
is
a
conventional
memory
hog
ver
i
am
considering
moving
all
our
machines
to
wwg
q
how
much
conventional
ram
does
wwg
use
over
and
above
the
driver
for
the
network
card
i
have
just
checked
it
and
you
have
three
files
that
are
loaded
protman
bytes
driver
bytes
workgrp
bytes
q
if
i
have
a
novell
ne
card
are
the
lsl
and
ipx
drivers
still
needed
no
wwg
uses
its
own
drivers
q
does
wwg
do
a
license
check
over
the
network
to
ensure
each
machine
is
running
its
own
licenced
copy
of
wwg
note
i
do
not
want
to
break
the
license
agreement
and
i
will
buy
a
copy
of
wwg
for
each
of
our
machines
it
is
just
that
i
would
like
to
try
it
out
first
to
see
if
it
meets
our
needs
returning
one
opened
copy
is
much
easier
than
returning
n
opened
copies
not
that
i
know
of
i
bought
two
copies
had
some
problems
with
one
installed
both
from
the
same
copie
no
problems
do
worry
i
just
had
a
really
old
bios
and
thats
the
only
problem
i
got
q
if
you
buy
the
upgrade
to
windows
for
wwg
does
it
replace
all
of
win
as
you
install
it
or
does
it
depend
on
current
win
files
it
will
replace
all
older
files
i
think
and
prompt
you
for
the
others
q
if
i
install
windows
nt
on
my
server
when
it
comes
out
will
i
have
any
troubles
with
the
wwg
machines
this
i
do
not
know
when
i
started
this
message
i
was
going
to
ask
only
questions
but
i
got
carried
away
ill
stop
now
i
look
forward
to
your
replies
al
hope
this
helps
gel
