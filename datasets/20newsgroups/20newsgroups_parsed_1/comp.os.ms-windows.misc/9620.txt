i
dont
know
much
about
windows
nt
but
ive
always
thought
that
win
nt
would
run
only
on
intel
compatable
systems
we
are
setting
up
a
network
which
includes
a
sun
sparc
server
and
about
a
dozen
pcs
some
people
suggest
that
we
run
windows
nt
on
the
sun
sparc
server
replacing
the
current
os
sunos
i
dont
know
whether
this
is
possible
and
whether
this
would
do
us
any
good
i
would
appreciate
any
help
on
answering
a
few
questions
below
does
windows
nt
run
on
sun
sparc
server
if
the
answer
to
question
is
yes
does
it
run
unix
applications
such
as
sas
for
unix
is
windows
nt
a
multiuser
os
when
will
windows
nt
be
released
is
there
any
telephone
number
that
i
can
call
and
get
more
info
on
win
nt
thank
you
minghua
shan
as
far
as
i
have
read
win
nt
will
be
supported
on
intel
dec
alpha
and
the
mips
r
series
of
processors
only
i
do
remember
though
reading
a
rumour
about
sparc
support
sometime
in
the
future
i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
running
unix
applications
you
would
have
to
have
sas
for
win
nt
or
maybe
sas
for
win
etc
i
have
read
that
ms
will
anounce
avalaibility
of
win
nt
by
end
of
may
comdex
spring
hope
this
helps
