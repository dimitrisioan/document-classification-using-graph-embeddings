hello
im
having
problems
printing
spanish
characters
with
wfw
i
was
using
the
celtic
true
type
which
has
the
accented
characters
and
used
insert
symbol
to
put
in
in
the
document
however
when
i
put
it
in
the
doc
i
get
a
big
square
character
and
then
it
prints
out
just
the
same
to
my
dismay
thinking
that
was
just
the
way
it
worked
can
anyone
tell
me
if
and
how
they
have
printed
spanish
characters
i
know
wp
has
this
builtin
but
i
do
not
recall
ever
seeing
this
option
on
wfw
