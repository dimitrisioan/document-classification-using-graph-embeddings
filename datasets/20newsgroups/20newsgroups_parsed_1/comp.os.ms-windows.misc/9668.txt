videoblaster
pc
speaker
software
that
comes
together
with
the
videoblaster
is
designed
to
work
together
with
the
soundblaster
from
the
same
manufacturer
since
i
do
not
own
a
soundblaster
is
there
a
possibility
to
use
the
pc
speaker
driver
to
play
audio
files
for
the
videoblaster
avi
audio
video
interleave
files
i
think
what
i
should
have
is
a
device
driver
for
the
media
player
that
controls
the
pc
speaker
driver
instead
of
the
soundblaster
card
something
like
mcispkrdrv
has
anybody
heard
of
such
a
driver
or
am
i
on
the
wrong
track

information
on
this
