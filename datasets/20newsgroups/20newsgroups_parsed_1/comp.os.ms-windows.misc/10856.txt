at

you
have
ibm
consultants
trying
to
help
ive
never
heard
of
microsoft
sending
customer
engineers
to
a
clients
organization
to
help
solve
problems
could
be
wrong
but
if
they
do
its
not
common
knowledge
microsoft
has
a
division
called
microsoft
consulting
that
does
what
ibm
fes
field
engineers
do
however
neither
company
just
up
and
sends
consultants
to
client
sites
both
companies
charge
very
high
hourly
rates
for
onsite
consulting
unless
the
client
has
already
paid
an
annual
