floppy
copy
works
under
pgm
mgr
but
not
dos
shell
has
anyone
observed
this
if
i
copy
a
large
say
k
file
a
large
pkzip
file
for
instance
to
my
floppy
drive
under
ms
windows
via
either
program
manager
or
a
dos
shell
the
file
copied
under
the
dos
shell
has
errors
whereas
the
file
copied
from
within
program
manager
does
not
the
corruption
is
detected
by
executing
pkunzip
t
bfilezip
after
both
copies
the
file
copied
via
the
dos
shell
always
shows
corruption
now
heres
the
kicker
i
have
many
windows
open
while
doing
this
both
dos
and
windows
apps
supposedly
all
windows
apps
share
the
same
time
slice
whereas
the
dos
apps
get
their
own
equal
time
slice
unless
overriden
so
as
an
example
i
have
windows
apps
open
multitasking
dos
sessions
running
and
one
executionexeclusive
dos
shell
iconized
inactive
under
this
scenario
cpu
time
is
divided
into
two
major
slices
one
for
all
the
windows
apps
and
one
slice
for
the
running
dos
app
when
copying
under
windows
pgm
mgr
ill
assume
the
other
windows
and
dos
tasks
are
essentially
inactive
thus
pgm
mgr
gets
say
of
the
windows
slice
and
of
the
executionbackground
dos
shells
slices
thus
it
gets
or
of
the
total
available
cpu
time
when
copying
in
a
dos
shell
i
activate
the
executeexclusive
mode
dos
shell
no
other
dos
background
tasks
allowed
full
screen
under
the
windows
task
manager
the
cpu
time
available
to
this
shell
would
be
of
the
windows
slice
assumming
inactive
windows
applications
and
of
the
dos
slice
or
of
the
total
available
cpu
time
so
why
do
i
get
copy
errors
under
dos
if
it
has
the
greater
amount
of
cpu
time
is
program
manager
working
in
a
preemptive
mode
during
the
floppy
copy
it
must
be
