hello
fellow
netters
i
am
asking
for
your
collected
wisdom
to
help
me
decide
which
printer
i
should
purchase
the
canon
bj
bubblejet
vs
the
hp
deskjet
i
thought
rather
than
trust
the
salesperson
i
would
benefit
more
from
relying
on
those
who
use
these
printers
daily
and
use
them
to
their
fullest
potential
and
i
figure
all
of
you
will
know
their
benefits
and
pitfalls
better
than
any
salesperson
now
i
would
greatly
appreciate
any
information
you
could
render
on
the
dpi
of
the
canon
bubblejet
vs
the
hewlettpackard
deskjet
dpi
which
is
faster
is
there
a
noticeable
print
quality
difference
particularly
in
graphics
which
will
handle
large
documents
better
pages
or
more
any
personal
experience
on
either
will
be
appreciated
here
which
works
better
under
windows
any
driver
problems
etc
cost
of
memory
font
packages
toner
cartridges
etc
basically
your
personal
experiences
with
either
of
these
machines
is
highly
desirable
both
good
and
bad
advance
kudos
and
thanks
for
all
your
input
email
or
news
posting
is
readily
acceptable
but
email
is
encouraged
limits
bandwidth
sincerely
robert
kayman
or
in
theory
theory
and
practice
are
the
same
in
practice
they
are
not
you
mean
you
want
the
revised
revision
of
the
original
revised
revision
revised
all
right
not
saying
i
know
any
more
than
the
average
salesguy
ill
give
your
question
a
shot
the
key
issue
that
i
bought
my
bj
on
was
ink
drying
speed
you
really
have
to
try
awful
hard
to
get
the
bj
ink
to
smear
the
hp
deskjets
need
seconds
to
completely
dry
in
both
cases
however
do
not
get
your
pages
wet
unlike
laser
printers
the
material
on
your
pages
is
ink
not
toner
but
that
should
go
without
saying
my
pc
has
very
little
memory
only
meg
ram
so
the
bj
takes
a
little
while
to
print
but
every
application
i
use
takes
a
while
to
run
once
the
computer
is
solely
printing
it
purs
like
a
kitten
and
puts
pages
out
every
seconds
depending
on
how
detailed
your
graphics
are
the
bj
can
do
windows
soft
fonts
im
assuming
that
the
deskjet
can
or
hp
wouldnt
sell
many
size
is
another
factor
the
bj
is
much
smaller
but
the
hp
is
built
like
a
tank
i
bet
the
bj
would
get
damaged
first
finally
the
print
quality
i
love
the
bjs
resolution
it
looks
like
a
good
laser
quality
print
the
hps
ive
usedthey
look
like
ink
not
as
impressive
so
i
chose
the
canon
any
other
opinions
