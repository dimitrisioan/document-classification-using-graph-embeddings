i
have
a
microsoft
serial
mouse
and
am
using
mousecom
was
using
i
think
but
switched
to
to
see
if
it
was
any
better
vertical
motion
is
nice
and
smooth
but
horizontal
motion
is
so
bad
i
sometimes
cant
click
on
something
because
my
mouse
jumps
around
i
can
be
moving
the
mouse
to
the
right
with
relatively
uniform
motion
and
the
mouse
will
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
to
the
right
then
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
again
maybe
this
time
to
the
left
about
inch
this
is
crazy
i
have
never
had
so
much
trouble
with
a
mouse
before
anyone
have
any
solutions
does
microsoft
think
they
are
what
everyone
should
be
just
venting
steam
ive
seen
this
problem
several
times
it
was
always
the
result
of
the
little
rollers
inside
the
mouse
becomming
dirty
they
are
good
at
collecting
grime
the
solution
is
simple
remove
the
ball
to
reveal
the
two
rollers
carefully
clean
them
and
the
ball
dennis
