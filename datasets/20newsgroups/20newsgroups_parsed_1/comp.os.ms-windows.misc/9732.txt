re
atm
so
good
that
there
isnt
any
diff
whether
or
not
atmanager
is
turned
on
or
not
is
it
worth
it
to
run
atm
at
all
especially
with
these
better
printer
technologies
and
tt
there
are
some
fonts
that
are
only
available
as
ps
fonts
if
you
have
a
ps
font
that
you
want
to
use
use
atm
otherwise
it
is
a
waste
of
system
resources
or
if
you
need
to
use
a
service
bureau
and
theyre
only
set
up
to
use
type
fonts
from
what
ive
heard
pure
hearsay
the
results
of
outputting
tt
fonts
as
type
is
not
as
good
as
using
highquality
type
fonts
in
the
first
place
