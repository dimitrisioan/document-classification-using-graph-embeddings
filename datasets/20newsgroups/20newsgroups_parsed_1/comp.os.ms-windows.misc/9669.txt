problem
calling
runtime
functions
i
have
a
small
windows
program
which
i
can
not
get
to
work
the
program
looks
vaguely
like
this
char
f
int
winmain
lstrcpy
lpstrf
hello
long
far
pascal
wndproc
lstrcpy
lpstrf
hello
i
am
using
large
model
under
windows
after
linking
without
errors
the
rc
program
said
sorting
preload
segments
and
resources
into
fastload
section
copying
segment
bytes
rc
fatal
error
rw
segment
and
its
relocation
information
is
too
large
for
load
optimization
make
the
segment
loadoncall
or
rerun
rc
using
the
k
switch
if
the
segment
must
be
preloaded
using
the
k
switch
seems
to
interfere
with
the
proper
function
of
the
second
lstrcpy
call
can
anybody
explain
what
is
going
on
andor
how
to
fix
it
thanks
