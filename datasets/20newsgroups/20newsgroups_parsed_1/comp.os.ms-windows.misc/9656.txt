there
i
bought
windows
dutch
version
some
time
ago
and
run
it
on
a
i
recently
upgraded
my
computer
to
a
dx
k
cache
m
memory
m
maxtor
hd
works
real
fine
but
not
with
windows
when
playing
patience
sol
or
minesweeper
suddenly
the
system
hangs
i
just
cant
move
my
mouse
anymore
or
screen
goes
blank
nothing
further
or
screen
goes
blank
computer
seems
to
reboot
but
stops
before
reaching
the
end
of
the
memory
test
once
or
maybe
even
twice
i
got
a
message
about
some
illegal
kernel
call
or
something
accompanied
by
a
hex
adress
and
a
closebutton
when
pressing
it
the
application
wouldnt
close
though
i
havent
experienced
this
problem
with
other
programs
than
these
but
thats
mainly
because
i
havent
really
used
other
programs
i
suspect
them
to
hang
too
anything
known
about
this
problem
or
better
any
patches
available
oh
forgot
to
tell
if
in
cmos
ram
i
make
the
computer
faster
higher
bus
speed
less
wait
states
enable
both
caches
etc
the
crash
comes
faster
after
min
or
so
if
i
deliberately
slow
the
system
down
slow
bus
speed
wait
states
disable
internalexternal
cache
no
shadowing
the
crash
comes
later
but
comes
hope
anyone
can
help
