re
data
segments
and
memory
model
usage
hello
phjm
you
wrote
firstly
does
windows
in
enhanced
mode
do
anything
special
with
dlls
that
have
been
compiled
using
the
large
memory
model
no
we
are
being
told
that
even
in
enhanced
mode
windows
will
load
dlls
into
real
memory
below
k
and
pagelock
it
no
my
second
question
relates
to
static
data
inside
dlls
is
there
any
way
at
all
to
get
multiple
instances
of
the
static
data
segment
dgroup
no
but
you
can
allocate
real
static
data
within
code
segments
when
you
need
more
dynamic
memory
you
can
allocate
data
on
the
global
heap
you
can
forget
most
of
what
was
written
about
memory
management
under
you
have
paged
virtual
memory
you
can
lock
every
block
without
hampering
the
memory
manager
you
can
use
far
pointer
everytime
without
always
lock
unlocking
the
memory
block
an
besides
dlls
are
mostly
just
disguised
exes
that
happen
to
be
called
by
another
