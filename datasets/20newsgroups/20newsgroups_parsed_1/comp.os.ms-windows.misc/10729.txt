than
of
mailorder
price

have
three
libraries
all
on
cd
which
cost
me
over
two
thousand
dollars
mail
order
they
are
all
genuine
high
quality

a
silly
eps

costs
a
thousand
bucks
mailorder
i
rate
this
clip
art
as
high
quality
much
better
than
dynamic
graphics
clip
art
sotmc
clip
art
etc
in
my
opinion
but
i
rate
both
the
g
library
and
the
car
library
as
higher
totems
art
is
all
color
whereas
most
of
the
others
are
bw
its
the
best
allcolor
library
out
there
in
my
opinion
car
graphics
library
havent
counted
how
many
images
but
you
can
purchase
the
library
on
floppies
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
size
this
costs
about
hundred
bucks
mailorder
i
rate
this
clip
art
as
very
high
quality
but
its
only
bw
g
graphics
library
very
popular
in
all
the
mac
mags
this
costs
about
hundred
bucks
mailorder
i
rate
this
clip
art
as
very
high
quality
got
some
awards
in
one
of
the
major
mac
mags
forgot
which
some
of
the

bw

what
its
worth
all

of
the
cds

saved
in
multiple
file
formats

are
readable
on
macs
and
pcs
