windows
and
multiple
monitors
m
apart
hi
i
am
working
on
gathering
data
on
the
way
that
users
use
computers
this
involves
getting
subjects
to
type
and
use
a
mouse
i
want
to
be
able
to
watch
what
they
are
doing
without
being
in
the
same
room
it
would
be
ideal
if
i
could
watch
the
session
on
another
monitor
without
the
subjects
knowledge
i
believe
that
spliting
the
monitor
cable
will
only
work
for
short
distances
ie
m
i
will
need
to
be
approx
m
away
as
the
cable
travels
the
pcs
are
connected
to
a
tcpip
network
and
run
windows
is
there
any
software
that
will
allow
me
to
watch
what
is
happening
on
another
pc
thanks
regards
