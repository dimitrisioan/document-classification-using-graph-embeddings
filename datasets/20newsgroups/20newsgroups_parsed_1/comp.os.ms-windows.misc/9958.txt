can
you
set
up
a
shortcut
key
to
return
to
the
program
manager
i
know
ctlesc
esc
will
do
it
but
id
rather
set
it
up
so
i
can
avoid
the
task
list
and
get
back
to
the
pm
with
altf
you
might
try
the
recorder
and
make
a
micro
i
done
that
to
do
certain
operations
in
a
windows
app
that
didnt
have
the
ability
to
use
a
micro
it
should
be
in
the
accessories
window
the
only
problem
is
that
it
has
to
be
runing
for
it
to
work
but
good
luck
