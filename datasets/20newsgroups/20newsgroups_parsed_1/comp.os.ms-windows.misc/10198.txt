subject
problem
on
dos
box
from
windows
this
file
is
compressed
ive
started
getting
a
message
from
windows
whenever
i
try
to
execute
a
dos
program
from
windows
either
thru
the
program
manager
or
the
file
manager
a
message
box
comes
up
and
says
this
program
or
one
of
its
components
is
compressed
use
the
msdos
expand
command
to
expand
the
file
now
i
know
this
is
bogus
because
i
can
always
execute
the
program
from
dos
when
not
running
windows
the
program
in
question
is
commandcom
yup
the
basic
dos
command
line
shell
and
the
expand
command
tells
me
that
the
file
is
already
expanded
all
my
windows
apps
work
just
fine
i
only
get
this
message
when
trying
to
execute
a
dos
program
from
windows
clues
anyone
thanks
