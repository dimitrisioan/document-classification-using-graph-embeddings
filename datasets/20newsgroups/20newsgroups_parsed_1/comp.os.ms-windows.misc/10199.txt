im
writing
a
mail
management
system
using
word
for
windows
as
a
front
end
the
user
dials
up
a
remote
system
and
downloads
a
batch
of
mail
as
footxt
ive
set
up
an
autoexec
macro
in
winword
to
load
footxt
ok
but
subsequent
invocations
of
the
macro
will
of
course
pose
file
name
contention
problems
what
id
really
like
to
do
is
to
create
an
autoexit
macro
in
winword
that
would
move
footxt
to
a
specified
directory
rename
it
using
the
current
date
and
time
and
delete
the
original
footxt
in
other
words
footxt
gets
renamed
as
say
on
may
at
the
user
gets
a
timeindexed
backup
of
his
mail
files
and
footxt
is
freed
up
for
the
next
packet
of
mail
since
my
autoexec
macro
points
to
it
my
main
question
is
this
how
may
one
rename
a
file
from
within
a
wordbasic
macro
to
include
a
timedate
variable
in
the
new
filename
thanks
if
you
ever
reach
total
enlightenment
