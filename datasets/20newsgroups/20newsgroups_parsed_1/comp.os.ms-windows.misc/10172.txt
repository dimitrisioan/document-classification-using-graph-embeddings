from
daniel
ellard
a
friend
of
mine
uses
windows
to
do
most
of
her
work
unfortunately
she
has
very
bad
eyesight
and
we
havent
been
able
to
figure
out
how
to
change
the
default
font
used
by
the
system
and
application
menus
or
the
font
used
by
the
help
program
what
use
is
hypertext
if
you
cant
read
it
to
make
it
legible
to
her
if
anyone
knows
how
to
increase
the
size
of
these
fonts
of
any
software
package
that
makes
windows
more
accessible
to
visually
handicapped
people
please
let
me
know
thanks
dan
