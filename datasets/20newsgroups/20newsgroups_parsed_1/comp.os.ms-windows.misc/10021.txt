standard
and
enhanced
question
why
is
win
sometimes
so
finicky
i
have
a
new
dell
dxmhz
megs
ram
windows
was
working
just
great
i
had
a
bus
mouse
and
mother
board
problem
dell
replaced
the
mouse
gave
me
a
newer
mouse
driver
for
windows
and
replaced
the
motherboard
just
prior
to
this
problem
windows
would
only
load
up
every
other
time
i
would
get
the
logo
and
either
it
would
go
on
into
windows
or
lock
up
this
was
very
consistent
every
other
time
now
with
the
new
motherboard
and
all
it
still
does
the
same
thing
the
computer
is
less
than
one
month
old
at
first
it
worked
fine
i
can
get
into
windows
each
time
now
with
the
wins
command
this
forces
standard
mode
things
seem
to
run
slower
i
mainly
use
windows
apps
but
in
standard
mode
there
is
no
virtual
mem
plus
it
is
slower
i
reloaded
windows
it
still
does
the
same
thing
should
i
first
delete
everything
in
all
windows
dirs
i
did
not
because
i
have
so
much
added
in
sub
dirs
etc
really
puzzling
why
enhanced
mode
would
not
load
each
time
but
consistently
every
other
time
standard
mode
each
time
any
thoughts
or
comments
