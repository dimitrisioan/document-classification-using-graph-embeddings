so
i
think
there
are
possibilities
im
right
if
my
disk
really
crashes
i
would
at
least
have
to
reinstall
dos
and
windows
to
get
the
backup
program
working
using
the
software
youre
using
i
agree
with
you
there
what
i
did
i
installed
dos
windows
and
cpbackup
functionally
the
same
as
your
norton
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
and
used
the
dos
backup
command
on
just
that
much
to
restore
i
boot
to
the
system
diskette
and
use
dos
restore
to
read
in
that
much
then
boot
to
windows
and
restore
my
full
backups
using
cpb
norton
in
your
case
overwriting
what
ive
just
restored
that
allows
me
to
keep
this
skeletal
windows
essentially
unchanged
with
all
my
customization
on
the
real
copy
done
using
the
rdparty
backup
utility
im
wrong
there
is
an
easy
way
to
make
a
mirror
of
a
hard
disk
that
can
easily
restore
its
state
from
scratch
seems
possible
if
you
can
put
skeletal
versions
of
dos
and
your
backup
utility
on
a
system
floppy
then
you
could
restore
it
all
on
one
go
