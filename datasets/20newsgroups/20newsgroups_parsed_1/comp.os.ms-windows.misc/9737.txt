while
running
the
ms
quick
c
compiler
in
a
dos
window
under
windows
this
evening
i
got
a
program
has
violated
system
integrity
close
all
applications
exit
windows
and
restart
your
computer
error
gawd
i
love
windows
is
there
an
easy
way
to
restore
everything
to
working
order
what
might
be
some
better
approaches
youll
probably
want
to
delete
any
damaged
executables
and
reload
them
fresh
data
files
should
be
examined
and
repaired
what
might
have
caused
this
does
the
smartdrv
cache
make
me
more
vulnerable
im
suspicious
of
hard
drive
caches
especially
when
they
cache
data
writing
youre
not
stupid
smartdrive
caches
things
and
windows
also
runs
a
swap
file
which
may
contain
data
also
all
of
this
is
pretty
risky
stuff
in
a
pc
environment
the
straightforward
approach
would
be
to
run
chkdsk
with
the
f
option
to
fix
the
disk
and
then
it
looks
like
i
would
probably
have
to
reinstall
windows
and
a
few
other
things
a
reasonably
accurate
prediction
heres
a
brief
description
of
how
dos
stores
files
there
are
three
pieces
to
a
file
the
directory
entry
the
fat
chain
and
the
data
area
you
can
think
of
these
as
a
sheet
of
lined
notebook
paper
a
sheet
of
graph
paper
and
a
stack
of
x
cards
the
directory
entry
notebook
paper
holds
the
file
name
actual
size
and
first
cluster
number
it
also
holds
some
other
information
thats
not
important
right
now
the
file
allocation
table
fat
chain
graph
paper
tells
where
to
find
the
actual
data
each
square
of
graph
paper
holds
a
number
if
the
number
is
zero
the
cluster
associated
with
this
box
is
available
if
it
holds
a
magic
number
it
is
either
the
last
piece
of
a
file
or
a
bad
unuseable
spot
on
the
disk
any
other
number
tells
which
cluster
contains
the
next
section
of
the
file
the
data
area
x
cards
is
where
the
actual
information
is
stored
the
data
area
is
organized
as
clusters
of
a
fixed
size
storage
is
doled
out
in
chunks
of
one
cluster
each
in
your
case
one
cluster
is
bytes
as
a
cluster
is
filled
another
is
allocated
to
read
a
file
you
first
look
at
the
directory
entry
to
get
the
starting
cluster
number
now
you
read
the
data
from
that
cluster
next
look
at
the
fat
entry
for
the
cluster
you
just
read
this
will
tell
you
the
cluster
number
for
the
next
chunk
of
the
file
naturally
these
numbers
are
usually
sequential
but
they
can
jump
around
and
even
go
backwards
continue
reading
one
cluster
at
a
time
as
you
walk
this
chain
through
the
fat
until
you
hit
the
marker
which
says
its
the
last
cluster
in
the
file
chkdsk
is
the
dos
utility
that
checks
the
sanity
and
coherence
of
the
directories
and
the
fat
and
can
bludgeon
most
flaws
into
submission
it
doesnt
have
any
intelligence
so
you
have
to
doublecheck
anything
it
fixes
now
lets
do
a
bit
of
a
postmortem
cgfxvpiccvpicexe
cgfxvpicvpictxt
cgfxvpicvideocfg
cgfxvpicorcprocfg
cgfxvpicvgacfg
cgamegoosebirdx
cwinmiscadvwinadvexe
allocation
error
size
adjusted
all
of
these
files
have
sizes
according
to
the
fat
which
dont
match
the
size
reported
in
their
directory
entries
chkdsk
f
will
alter
the
directory
entries
to
match
the
fat
size
in
other
words
the
directory
entry
for
cvpicexe
may
say
the
file
is
bytes
long
but
chkdsk
found
a
fat
chain
of
clusters
attached
to
it
my
numbers
obviously
are
made
up
lost
allocation
units
found
in
chains
bytes
disk
space
would
be
freed
disk
space
was
found
which
is
allocated
in
the
fat
but
is
not
attached
to
any
directory
entry
chkdsk
f
gives
you
the
option
of
converting
these
lost
chains
to
files
you
can
then
examine
the
files
filechk
through
filechk
and
rename
or
discard
them
or
if
you
tell
chkdsk
not
to
convert
them
to
files
then
those
clusters
will
simply
be
marked
available
in
the
fat
cgfxvpiccvpicexe
is
cross
linked
on
allocation
unit
cspartpar
is
cross
linked
on
allocation
unit
these
files
are
both
referencing
the
same
data
cluster
obviously
one
of
them
at
least
must
be
wrong
its
interesting
to
note
that
cspartpar
is
your
windows
swap
file
to
fix
this
you
should
copy
each
crosslinked
file
to
a
new
name
this
will
fix
the
crosslink
by
giving
the
files
unique
data
spaces
now
delete
the
crosslinked
files
examine
the
copies
and
try
to
assemble
them
properly
good
luck
hint
missing
pieces
are
likely
to
be
found
in
those
lost
chains
at
the
top
bytes
total
disk
space
bytes
in
hidden
files
bytes
in
directories
bytes
in
user
files
bytes
available
on
disk
your
disk
is
pretty
close
to
full
this
may
be
the
actual
cause
of
the
problem
perhaps
windows
needed
to
expand
its
swapfile
by
an
amount
which
exceeded
available
disk
space
in
any
case
the
short
summary
is
that
something
trashed
your
fat
there
are
utilities
that
can
mirror
your
fat
and
help
repair
damage
after
something
like
this
but
you
have
to
run
them
before
the
problem
occurs
