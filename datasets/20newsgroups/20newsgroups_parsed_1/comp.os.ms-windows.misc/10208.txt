has
anyone
used
a
hercules
graphite
adapter
it
looks
good
on
paper
and
steve
gibson
gave
it
a
very
good
review
in
infoworld
id
love
to
get
a
realworld
impression
though
how
is
the
speed
drivers
support
ab

but
the
impressive
performance
of
the
graphite
was
not
its
winmark
it
was
its
wintach
result
esp
the
paint
performance
judging
from
the
wintach
tests
i
can
hardly
imagine
that
there
is
a
cheat
driver
for
it
i
received
my
graphite
vl
on
thursday
and
ive
had
a
little
bit
of
experience
with
it
now
in
general
it
feels
fast
although
this
is
the
first
vlb
card
that
i
have
tried
still
the
results
are
impressive
with
my
dx
w
mb
running
at
x
ive
had
the
following
wintach
results
card
wp
cad
spread
paint
overall
ati

ultra
ati
ultra
no
aperture
hercules
graphite
vl
unfortunately
i
dont
have
the
numbers
here
but
the
ati
ultra
pro
vlb
had
an
overall
wintach
score
of
about
the
ultra
pro
was
nearly
as
fast
in
text
handling
but
was
blown
away
in
the
cad
and
paint
tests
as
an
additional
test
we
handtimed
a
complex
coreldraw
slide
resize
redraw
times
there
was
no
swapping
but
id
expect
there
is
a
fairly
heavy
load
on
the
cpu
the
graphite
redraw
times
averaged
about
seconds
with
ati
ultra
pro
at
this
jives
with
steve
gibsons
contention
that
the
isa
graphite
is
faster
than
an
ati
up
on
his
complex
micrografx
draw
document
so
far
im
very
impressed
the
drivers
look
solid
and
the
card
flies
the
installation
and
utilities
are
different
but
comparable
to
atis
and
i
didnt
have
to
wait
for
build
for
some
reliability
with
hercules
software
developer
special
you
can
get
an
evaluation
copy
of
the
card
for
just
or
for
the
isa
version
call
if
you
want
to
give
it
a
try
im
a
happy
customer
