stacker
achieves
better
compression
ratio
than
dos
yet
the
latter
comes
with
virus
detection
memory
manager
and
multiple
booting
each
of
them
are
not
so
good
as
the
nav
qemm
or
ndos
in
my
opinion
but
with
a
package
of
only
its
nice
if
havent
yet
installed
all
of
those
stuffs
both
certainly
work
with
win
