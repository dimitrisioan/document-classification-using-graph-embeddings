subject
re
mouse
on
com
under
windows
in
a
previous
article
joseph
paparella
says
ive
pursued
and
researched
this
question
over
the
last
month
or
so
because
i
have
the
same
requirements
you
doand
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
the
windows
mouse
drivers
dont
accept
mice
at
any
but
com
and
com
using
irq
or
irq
unless
you
buy
special
drivers
from
someone
who
has
themive
talked
to
mouse
systems
who
say
their
driver
doesnt
support
other
than
com
and
com
as
above
but
who
claim
to
be
releasing
one
that
will
soon
the
other
alternative
seems
to
be
possible
but
in
one
case
prohibitively
expensive
ie
port
card
for
and
in
the
other
the
authors
of
powerbbs
for
windows
claim
to
have
a
port
serial
card
with
buffered
uarts
and
drivers
for
windows
to
match
ie
com
irq
for
the
second
paragraph
is
hearsay
because
i
havent
checked
it
out
yetbut
intend
to
as
soon
as
i
can
free
up
g
hope
this
will
save
you
some
steps
i
had
this
problem
when
i
first
loaded
windows
my
io
card
is
for
hds
fds
parrelel
serial
for
mouse
and
for
my
external
modem
and
a
game
port
problem
enters
the
darn
serial
ports
have
no
selection
for
com
settings
they
are
stuck
on
and
good
card
for
hds
and
fds
but
lousy
for
serial
i
called
microsoft
and
other
places
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
windows
wants
com
and
only
for
mouse
selection
i
went
out
and
bought
a
small
io
card
just
for
parrelel
and
serial
now
i
have
all
active
com
ports
and
lpt
and
lpt
this
half
card
was
less
than
mouse
on
com
external
modem
on
com
i
disabled
the
lpt
so
i
could
use
the
interupt
for
my
scanner
card
