keyboard
specifications
to
all
hardware
and
firmware
gurus
my
current
home
project
is
to
build
a
huge
paddle
keyboard
for
a
physically
handicapped
relative
of
mine
my
goal
is
for
this
keyboard
to
look
exactly
like
an
at
sytle
keyboard
to
its
host
system
this
will
be
a
highly
endowed
keyboard
with
a
little
pcl
from
z
world
at
its
heart
the
only
thing
i
lack
is
detailed
information
on
the
hardware
signaling
that
the
with
windows
and
dos
will
be
expecting
my
project
is
independant
of
windows
my
hope
is
that
some
of
you
fellow
windows
usersprogrammers
will
recognize
what
i
need
and
be
willing
to
point
me
in
the
right
direction
i
have
the
winn
l
rosch
hardware
bible
nd
edition
the
hb
gives
most
if
not
all
of
the
information
i
will
need
concerning
scan
codes
and
even
a
wire
diagram
for
the
ps
style
connector
i
will
need
but
it
leaves
a
number
of
important
questions
unanswered
is
it
synchronous
or
asynchronous
serial
communication
im
guessing
synchronous
since
the
host
is
providing
a
clock
in
either
event
how
is
the
data
framed
is
it
halfduplex
or
truly
one
way
im
guessing
halfduplex
since
the
host
can
turn
leds
on
and
off
are
there
any
chipsets
available
for
communicating
with
the
at
keyboard
standard
other
than
by
cannibalizing
a
real
keyboard
if
anyone
knows
of
a
book
or
article
or
any
other
written
source
of
information
on
the
above
please
advise
me
at
whatever
i
do
it
must
be
safe
for
i
can
not
afford
to
replace
the
in
the
event
of
a
booboo
thank
you
for
your
time
