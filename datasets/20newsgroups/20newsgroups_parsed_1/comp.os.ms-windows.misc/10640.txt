you
are

ok
vi
is
not
cua
but
it
has
a
powerful
set
of
commands
one
for
all
it
has
separate
clipboard
and
not
only
one
ofor
all
kind
of
data
like
windows
does
the
only
problem
is
to
know
the
commands
the
keyboard
shortcut
i
am
quite
fast
with
the
pc
keyboard
and
i
usually
use
all
fingers
to
digit
so
when
i
use
a
editor
i
do
not
want
to
leave
the
keyboard
and
use
the
mouse
every
time
i
need
a
special
function
on
the
menu
or
to
use
the
arrow
keys
that
are
away
from
the
usual
position
of
my
hands
on
the
keyboard
in
my
situation
vi
is
very
powerful
and
im
searching
to
a
vi
editor
for
windows
bye
ps
sorry
for
the
bad
english
