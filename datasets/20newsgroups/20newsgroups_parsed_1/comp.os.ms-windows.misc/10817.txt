i
have
been
working
for
ms
for
the
past
years
i
have
been
a
developer
for
the
past
os
is
technically
superior
to
windows
considering
that
ms
makes
more
money
per
copy
of
os
sold
than
ibm
and
we
cowrote
most
of
it
differences
between
os
and
os
os
had
about
half
the
memory
requirements
os
was
quicker
even
at
half
the
memory
os
was
much
more
stable
oh
and
one
more
thing
ibm
did
os
by
themselves
yes
a
lot
of
what
os
has
in
common
with
os
x
was
written
by
you
guys
however
many
of
the
things
that
made
os
so
much
more
successful
winos
workplace
shell
than
previous
versions
were
ibm
work
so
we
cowrote
it
may
be
technically
accurate
but
its
really
a
red
herring
as
the
bits
that
are
selling
the
product
werent
written
by
you
dont
forget
seamless
win
apps
on
os
ms
couldnt
do
it
viz
wlo
but
ibm
managed
to
do
it
right
