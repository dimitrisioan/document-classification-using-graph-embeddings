my
point
was
that
not
all
microsofties
are
here
to
sell
readers
on
our
products
which
would
conflict
with
the
noads
philosophy
of
usenet
nor
do
we
necessarily
have
access
to
info
that
others
have
it
certainly
smacks
of
that
remember
the
poll
that
you
quoted
saying
that
you
had
seen
a
of
users
being
satisfied
with
dos
it
was
and
actually
another
msdos
team
member
posted
it
note
that
people
not
on
the
msdos
team
would
not
necessarily
know
about
that
or
care
to
recall
how
unbiased
the
sample
set
was
when
i
heard
those
numbers
i
wondered
how
they
got
them
having
worked
in
product
support
and
knowing
that
the
typical
support
caller
has
very
little
positive
to
say
about
the
product
i
figured
it
wasnt
from
there
so
i
wandered
over
to
the
marketing
folks
and
asked
and
i
was
told
it
was
from
a
survey
of
registered
users
and
i
posted
that
on
the
net
when
people
asked
where
the
figure
came
from
that
post
sure
looked
like
fudand
coming
from
a
microsoftie
well
it
sure
seemed
like
something
was
not
on
level
hmm
i
figured
if
chuck
posted
the
numbers
why
not
include
where
they
came
from
i
also
find
it
interesting
that
postitive
info
is
fear
uncertainty
doubt
advocacy
is
good
but
spreading
fud
to
advocate
your
favorite
os
is
very
unethical
especially
when
you
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
success
of
that
os
i
think
youve
got
me
confused
with
someone
else
i
dont
pretend
that
msdos
provides
what
all
people
need
or
that
other
oses
including
unix
os
dont
provide
useful
andor
necessary
features
i
also
dont
push
people
to
use
msdos
i
even
posted
in
composmsdosmisc
that
i
suggest
waiting
before
installing
a
new
os
esp
if
you
have
trouble
support
is
always
overloaded
during
release
unless
the
sales
are
a
total
bomb
i
also
get
tired
of
people
assuming
that
microsofties
are
like
members
of
the
borg
that
is
because
their
actions
seem
to
invite
this
opinion
never
seen
more
defensive
people
in
my
life
i
aint
saying
some
of
us
dont
get
defensive
sometimes
do
you
really
think
msdos
gets
any
more
respect
within
microsoft
than
outside
it
i
just
mean
we
all
arent
cut
out
of
the
same
dough
with
the
same
cookie
cutter
we
dont
all
think
alike
yeah
chuckst
and
i
have
some
inside
info
on
msdos
doesnt
mean
that
everyone
else
does
seriously
speaking
it
is
a
shame
that
ms
techie
employees
get
the
heat
for
mss
actions
most
of
which
are
perpetrated
by
the
management
and
marketing
i
am
sure
that
they
are
very
talented
etc
i
have
not
doubts
about
their
abilities
just
about
the
ethics
of
their
marketing
practices
