hi
i
am
thinking
of
upgrading
to
the
beta
version
of
windows
nt
on
a
sx
mhz
mb
hard
disc
can
someone
please
give
me
there
opion
on
such
a
setup
for
running
nt
and
is
the
operating
system
likely
to
be
better
than
windows
or
unixs
steve
ive
been
using
windows
nt
tm
since
the
october
release
and
i
have
to
say
that
the
march
release
is
really
a
big
improvement
windows
nt
tm
is
becomming
usable
there
are
a
few
things
to
consider
before
you
make
the
leap
though
first
for
me
at
least
is
that
you
can
not
get
a
fullspeed
dos
box
what
i
mean
is
i
can
not
for
instance
run
falcon
or
any
other
resourse
intensive
program
in
a
dos
box
it
absolutley
crawls
and
my
machine
is
a
with
a
mb
hd
and
mb
ram
if
anyone
knows
how
to
get
a
fast
dos
box
or
fullscreen
for
that
matter
please
let
me
know
the
second
thing
is
there
are
still
not
many
drivers
around
for
stuff
for
instance
my
pas
has
been
demoted
to
running
as
a
sound
blaster
which
is
natively
supported
nice
because
mediavision
hasnt
produced
drivers
yet
your
disk
should
be
large
enough
to
keep
an
mb
dos
partition
and
give
the
rest
over
to
windows
nt
tm
the
only
thing
is
whenever
you
wanted
to
run
windows
programs
youd
have
to
reboot
and
log
into
windows
nt
tm
instead
of
just
typing
win
windows
nt
tm
does
seem
to
be
much
more
stable
than
normal
windows
though
itd
be
a
good
choice
if
you
have
the
resources
you
should
really
have
at
least
mb
ram
though
one
last
thing
modems
work
well
enough
but
i
have
yet
to
get
my
fax
card
to
work
and
ive
never
heard
of
anyone
else
who
did
either
its
only
better
than
unix
because
it
runs
killer
software
out
of
the
box
whereas
with
unix
there
isnt
the
same
availablity
i
guess
it
comes
down
to
windows
nt
tm
is
not
yet
for
the
faint
of
heart
its
still
a
beta
but
its
a
very
good
beta
