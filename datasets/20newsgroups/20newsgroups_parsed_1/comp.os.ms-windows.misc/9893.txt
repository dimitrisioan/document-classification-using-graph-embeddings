windows
video
card
info
needed
ok
i
have
a
dxisa
w
diamond
stealth
vram
mb
i
was
really
satisfied
w
its
performance
in
windows
but
now
more
and
more
games
needs
higher
frame
rates
in
dos
vga
especially
this
new
strike
commander
this
stealth
vram
can
only
give
me
fps
i
use
dbench
my
winmark
was
million
i
think
so
right
now
im
considering
to
replace
it
w
a
new
card
which
hopefully
can
perform
approx
same
w
my
current
vram
in
windows
and
also
can
perform
dos
vga
preferably
fps
i
also
saw
the
dbench
benchmark
list
from
someone
who
compiled
it
in
csipg
and
it
looked
that
speedstar
x
and
orchid
prodesigner
ds
ware
the
fastest
for
non
local
bus
motherboard
both
can
give
fps
in
dos
vga
w
dx
does
anyone
have
a
winmarks
for
both
of
those
cards
above
with
the
processor
type
which
one
is
the
worthiestnot
necessarily
fastest
any
other
card
recommendation
is
welcomed
too

the
cheapest
