to
all
those
people
who

found
shareware

which
mirrors
some

in
the

the
three

i
really
appreciate
this
information
however
given
that
i
dont
have
direct
internet
access
which
means
i
dont
have
archie
access
i
must
resort
to
using
ftpmail
this
means
that
i
need
the
site
name
and
the
directory
where
these
workspace
managers
are
located
so
can
you
or
anyone
else
post
or
email
me
the
needed
information
thanks
very
much
