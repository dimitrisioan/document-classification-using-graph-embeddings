animated
desktop
hiyas
all
upon
getting
animated
desktop
for
windows
as
a
gift
from
my
boyfriend
i
couldnt
wait
to
install
it
i
had
gotten
an
advertisement
for
it
and
put
it
aside
with
my
list
of
i
wants
after
installing
the
software
it
didnt
load
no
part
of
the
software
would
load
even
though
the
install
went
seemingly
well
i
called
deltapoint
with
the
problem
and
after
asking
me
twenty
million
different
questions
about
my
system
concluded
that
i
had
one
of
the
systems
that
the
software
was
incompatible
with
of
course
theyre
willing
to
give
me
my
back
what
a
waste
of
time
and
energy
the
folks
on
their
support
line
although
nice
are
extremely
ignorant
regarding
the
workings
of
windows
after
my
experience
with
the
installation
of
the
sb
i
learned
some
of
the
function
of
windows
dll
files
before
sending
back
desktop
animator
decided
to
do
some
fooling
around
with
the
different
versions
of
dll
files
i
had
i
had
versions
of
cpalettedll
one
dated
and
k
the
other
dated
and
smaller
the
smaller
version
was
the
one
supplied
with
desktop
animator
i
moved
the
bigger
older
version
of
cpalettedll
to
a
directory
outside
my
path
for
some
reason
i
had
the
older
cpalettedll
in
my
windows
directory
and
the
newer
cpallette
in
my
windowssystem
directory
when
i
did
this
the
animators
editor
loaded
and
so
did
other
of
the
applications
in
the
package
the
main
application
still
didnt
load
does
anyone
have
any
ideas
as
to
why
this
would
occur
or
any
further
suggestions
for
troubleshooting
