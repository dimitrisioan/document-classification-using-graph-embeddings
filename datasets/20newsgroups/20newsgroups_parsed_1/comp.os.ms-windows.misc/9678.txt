recolor
or
monochrome
walther
id
have
a
look
at
the
maximum
resolution
the
combination
of
the
video
card
and
screen
would
have
without
flickering
id
only
suggest
using
the
color
screen
if
it
does
without
flickering
if
this
is
not
too
small
for
your
tastes
at
a
personally
id
prefer
the
monoscreen
as
i
always
have
quite
a
few
windows
open
if
you
only
run
one
program
at
a
time
or
rarely
switch
maybe
the
color
surplus
is
worth
trading
in
the
smaller
size
if
you
want
to
develop
programs
you
will
always
have
to
check
the
colors
i
used
a
mono
screen
worst
of
both
worlds
and
was
surprised
how
the
colors
looked
i
choose
on
a
color
screen
