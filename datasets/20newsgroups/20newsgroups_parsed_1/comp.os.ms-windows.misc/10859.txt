very
poor
by

a
left
and
right
window
and
allows
file
operations
between
them
being
able
to
launch
programs
from
the
same
interface
would
be
nice
as
well
as
text
reading
and
graphics
viewing
those
who
are
familiar
with
directory
opus

the
amiga

what
im
looking
for
if
anyone
can
steer
me
towards
an
ftp
sight
with
these
programs

would
make
my
transition
to
windows
a
lot
easier
