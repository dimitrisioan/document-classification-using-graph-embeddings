subject
re
mouse
on
com
under
windows
ive
pursued
and
researched
this
question
over
the
last
month
or
so
because
i
have
the
same
requirements
you
doand
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
the
windows
mouse
drivers
dont
accept
mice
at
any
but
com
and
com
using
irq
or
irq
unless
you
buy
special
drivers
from
someone
who
has
themive
talked
to
mouse
systems
who
say
their
driver
doesnt
support
other
than
com
and
com
as
above
but
who
claim
to
be
releasing
one
that
will
soon
the
other
alternative
seems
to
be
possible
but
in
one
case
prohibitively
expensive
ie
port
card
for
and
in
the
other
the
authors
of
powerbbs
for
windows
claim
to
have
a
port
serial
card
with
buffered
uarts
and
drivers
for
windows
to
match
ie
com
irq
for
the
second
paragraph
is
hearsay
because
i
havent
checked
it
out
yetbut
intend
to
as
soon
as
i
can
free
up
g
hope
this
will
save
you
some
steps
