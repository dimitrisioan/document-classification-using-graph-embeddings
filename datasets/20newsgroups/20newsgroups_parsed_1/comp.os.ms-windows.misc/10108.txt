subject
emm
and
windows
on
my
pc
i
almost
exclusively
run
windows
the
only
dos
based
application
i
have
is
procommplus
in
my
configsys
i
have
emm
loaded
with
the
option
noems
no
expanded
memory
following
a
thread
in
one
of
the
comp
newsgroups
i
read
that
it
was
no
necessary
to
have
emm
loaded
indeed
in
the
manual
it
says
that
emm
is
used
to
get
expanded
memory
out
of
extended
memory
since
i
have
the
noems
option
it
seems
to
me
that
the
emm
device
is
useless
in
my
case
should
i
use
emm
or
should
i
remove
it
from
my
configsys
thanks
for
your
help
eric
