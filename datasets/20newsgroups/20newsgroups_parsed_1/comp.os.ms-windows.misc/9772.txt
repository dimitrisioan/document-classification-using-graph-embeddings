many
people
on
one
machine
i
have
several
people
sharing
my
machine
and
would
like
to
set
up
separate
environments
under
windows
for
each
of
them
is
there
some
way
of
setting
things
up
separate
desktopsdirectories
for
each
of
them
ideally
id
like
totally
separate
virtual
machines
id
be
willing
to
settle
for
less
and
may
end
up
having
batch
files
that
copy
ini
files
around
depending
on
who
wants
to
use
the
machine
mark
alas
setupn
doesnt
work
if
you
dont
have
a
network
