novell
and
windows
im
working
at
a
workstation
which
is
usually
attached
to
a
novell
network
using
shell
version
i
think
the
workstation
a
was
set
up
to
run
windows
with
the
network
about
a
year
ago
needless
to
say
id
like
to
upgrade
it
to
windows
and
have
it
work
with
the
network
basically
the
windows
filesd
be
on
the
local
hard
drive
but
several
dos
applications
like
word
perfect
will
be
on
the
network
id
mainly
want
windows
to
access
the
network
drives
the
network
printers
and
perhaps
handle
some
network
functions
as
well
if
i
could
multitask
the
dos
apps
whose
executables
are
on
the
network
thatd
be
great
but
i
could
live
without
it
eventually
id
like
to
get
a
few
other
s
in
the
office
working
with
the
network
and
windows
as
well
however
most
of
the
terminals
are
s
which
leaves
the
network
pretty
much
dosbound
and
i
guess
that
leaves
out
windows
for
workgroups
and
in
the
future
maybe
thered
be
norton
desktop
but
thats
gettingahead
of
myself
as
you
can
guess
ive
never
done
anything
like
this
before
ive
read
through
the
networks
material
that
came
with
windows
but
still
id
like
to
know
if
anyone
out
there
has
any
experience
in
such
an
area
please
reply
by
email
i
dont
scan
these
newsgroups
often

any
replies
