writes
now
does
anyone
know
if
it
is
possible
to
use
wwg
and
lan
workplace
for
dos
at
the
same
time
yup
were
using
both
and
they
work
just
fine
hopefully
someday
wfwg
will
communicate
over
lwp
tcpip
right
now
we
have
to
load
netbeui
i
use
odi
with
odinsup
and
all
works
well
hey
sounds
great
does
that
mean
that
wwg
works
with
odi
i
thought
it
uses
ndis
my
problem
is
that
lan
workplace
with
all
its
drivers
uses
up
most
of
my
umbs
so
id
hate
to
have
to
load
many
more
drivers
to
make
wwg
work
along
i
read
in
a
german
computer
magazine
that
tcpip
support
for
wwg
is
just
around
the
corner
anybody
have
any
news
about
this
regards
richard

was
spread

short
note
