i
am
looking
for
the
latest
drivers
for
the
actix
graphics
accelerator
card
the
driver
i
am
currently
using
is
version
and
doesnt
support
more
than
colors
in
x
mode
even
you
have
mb
memory
the
bbs
support
for
actix
is
unbelievable
they
are
still
using
bps
modem
it
will
take
you
hours
to
download
the
drivers
it
hurts
when
you
are
calling
long
distance
is
there
any
ftp
site
that
has
a
collection
of
video
drivers
for
windows
