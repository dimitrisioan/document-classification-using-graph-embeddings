sombodys

is

os
finder
systerm
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
doesnt
appear
in
the
first
survey
i
tend
to
doubt
their
results
more
just
because
sombody
wrote
it
doesnt
mean
its
correct
note
that
the
two
tables
dont
talk
about
the
same
population
one
is
fortune
companies
favoring
the
platform
as
their
primary
application
platform
the
other
is
sales
to
everyone
not
just
fortune
fortune
companies
dont
do
a
lot
of
development
with
the
mac
as
their
top
platform
i
would
expect
that
that
would
explain
the
discrepancy
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
