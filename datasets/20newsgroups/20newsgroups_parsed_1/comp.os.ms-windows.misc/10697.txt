re
why
is
my
mouse
so
jumpy
ms
mouse
i
have
a
microsoft
serial
mouse
and
am
using
mousecom
was
using
i
think
but
switched
to
to
see
if
it
was
any
better
vertical
motion
is
nice
and
smooth
but
horizontal
motion
is
so
bad
i
sometimes
cant
click
on
something
because
my
mouse
jumps
around
i
can
be
moving
the
mouse
to
the
right
with
relatively
uniform
motion
and
the
mouse
will
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
to
the
right
then
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
again
maybe
this
time
to
the
left
about
inch
this
is
crazy
i
have
never
had
so
much
trouble
with
a
mouse
before
anyone
have
any
solutions
aha
i
think
i
found
the
problem
and
it
isnt
dirt
another
guy
here
was
using
a
different
kind
of
mouse
and
was
using
xx
video
driver
the
default
vga
for
windows
he
has
an
s
localbus
card
like
i
do
and
when
i
loaded
the
s
video
driver
in
windows
for
him
his
mouse
became
jumpy
too
seems
like
it
is
the
s
driver
is
there
any
newer
one
than
version
that
would
solve
this
problem
it
is
really
bad
i
have
to
use
the
keyboard
instead
sometimes
the
swzip
on
cica
is
version
which
is
the
same
version
that
came
with
my
card
