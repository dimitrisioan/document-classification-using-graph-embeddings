in

article

says
in
windows
i
created
a
permanent
swapfile
of
kb
as
win
recommended
me
to
do
that
bit
access
if
i
use
emmexe
after
win
startup
i
have
k
of
memory
free
if
i
leave
emmexe
out
of
my
configsys
i
have
k
of
memory
free
and
windows
recommends
me
a
swap
file
of
k
i
think
you
need
the
emmexe
noems
this
will
let
the
expanded
mem
be
active
but
not
use
any
therefore
this
will
give
you
more
extended
mem
for
windows
yet
have
all
the
bases
covered
i
use
dos
with
memmaker
have
mb
of
internal
memory
and
a
dx
i
do
not
use
dos
so
i
am
not
familiar
with
this
does
anybody
knows
why
this
is
happening
possibly
win
needs
some
umbs
to
manage
virtual
memory
if
true
which
umbs
those
that
emm
can
find
without
including
suspicious
parts
i
need
an
optimized
dosenvironment
because
i
develop
applications
for
dos
using
a
windows
programming
environment
