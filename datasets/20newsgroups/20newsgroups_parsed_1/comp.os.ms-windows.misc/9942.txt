wrote
the
key
issue
that
i
bought
my
bj
on
was
ink
drying
speed
i
was
at
the
trenton
computer
fest
and
there
were
many
sources
of
ink
refills
for
the
hp
and
canon
so
if
you
dont
like
the
ink
youre
using
you
have
a
choice
there
is
a
frequently
asked
question
faq
list
thats
reposted
occasionally
that
reports
how
to
refill
the
cartridges
yourself
with
inks
that
are
available
from
the
stationery
store
instead
of
a
specialty
ink
with
the
specialty
price
im
not
sure
but
i
think
i
found
another
legal
source
of
cheap
hypos
for
injecting
ink
into
the
cartridges
more
on
that
when
my
mail
order
succeeds
