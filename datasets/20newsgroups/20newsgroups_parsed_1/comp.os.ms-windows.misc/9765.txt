i
have
just
noticed
my
filemanager
doing
something
strange
recently
usually
the
line
at
the
bottom
of
the
filemanager
the
status
bar
i
guess
displays
the
total
disk
space
and
the
total
number
of
bytes
for
the
current
selection
if
i
select
a
whole
bunch
of
files
i
will
get
an
exact
byte
count
recently
i
notice
it
incorrectly
displays
this
count
its
truncating
if
i
select
a
file
that
is
say
bytes
it
correctly
displays
bytes
if
i
select
select
a
file
that
is
bytes
it
displays
bytes
not
kbytes
just
bytes
if
i
select
it
will
report
only
bytes
in
the
selection
if
i
select
over
a
meg
worth
of
files
say
it
reports
bytes
its
as
if
its
got
a
problem
with
displaying
more
than
characters
my
system

dos
win
ive
run
the
latest
virus
scanners
scan
fprot
and
they
didnt
report
anything
could
i
have
unknowingly
altered
something
that
controls
the
formatting
of
the
status
bar
in
the
filemanger
it
sounds
like
somethingone
may
have
set
the
s
separator
to
in
contol
panel
under
international
this
makes
look
like
and
file
manager
is
chopping
off
what
it
thinks
is
the
decimal
part
of
the
file
size
becomes
and
again
file
manager
is
confused
by
the
decimal
points
where
there
should
be
commas
chopping
off
everything
to
the
right
of
the
first
period
