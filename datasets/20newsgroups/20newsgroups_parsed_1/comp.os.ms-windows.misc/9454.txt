amish

what
can
it
do
for
me
all
i
received
was

milks
the

i
am
running
windows
in
xx
mode
using
a
driver
that
was
supplied
with
my
svga
card
the
card
is
a
boca
svga
card
with
meg
ram
and
i
think
it
has
an
et
chip
in
it
at
least
thats
what
some
program
tells
me
the
driver
is
an
old
driver
that
was
written
for
windows
it
seems
to
work
fine
but
would
i
gain
any
benefits
by
switching
to
a
newer
driver
if
so
which
one
should
i
use
and
where
could
i
find
it
lots
of
drivers
are
available
off
ftpcicaindianaedu
in
pubpcwin
driversvideo
ive
tried
two
etcviewzip
and
etturbozip
these
give
you
a
choice
of
turbo
and
nonturbo
drivers
the
turbo
drivers
were
fast
but
caused
mouse
problems
with
my
machine
which
has
a
diamond
speedstar
card
i
finally
got
turbo
drivers
wndspeed
by
binar
from
diamond
amazing
blazingly
fast
for
a
nonaccelerated
card
and
best
of
all
no
gpfs
for
a
month
or
so
