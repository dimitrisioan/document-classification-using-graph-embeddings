windows
errors
and
a
bad
memory
hi
my
last
question
for
the
year
i
have
a
mailorder
noname
notebook
with
meg
ram
i
never
have
problems
with
my
huge
ramdisk
or
when
running
desqview
but
win
and
ww
constantly
crash
on
me
most
commonly
citing
a
memory
parity
error
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
turn
off
and
reboot
my
cmos
ticks
off
counts
all
the
memory
every
startup
and
there
is
never
a
problem
with
this
either
could
it
be
a
bug
in
my
windows
copy
instead
of
the
hardware
i
remember
having
some
disk
error
problems
when
installing
it
is
there
any
change
i
could
make
to
lessen
the
frequency
or
likelyhood
of
this
happening
i
think
win
vs
win
s
produce
different
crashes
but
both
crash
frequently
nonetheless
i
know
this
is
a
pain
but
please
answer
by
email
because
my
home
account
doesnt
have
rn
and
i
will
stop
asking
questions
now
thank
you
chet
