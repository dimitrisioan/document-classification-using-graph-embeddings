hi
if
you
have
developed
your
own
windows
application
you
must
have
a
sdk
of
some
sort
that
contains
the
hcexe
or
hcexe
file
to
compile
and
generate
hlp
files
out
of
rtf
files
rtf
files
are
generated
by
a
wordprocessor
like
word
for
dos
or
ww
you
do
not
need
the
sdk
what
you
need
and
can
get
free
are
location
