workgroup
questions
conven
ram
and
licensing
i
would
be
very
appreciative
if
someone
would
answer
a
few
questions
about
windows
for
workgroups
i
currently
have
novell
netware
lite
which
does
not
work
with
windows
very
well
and
is
a
conventional
memory
hog
ver
i
am
considering
moving
all
our
machines
to
wwg
q
how
much
conventional
ram
does
wwg
use
over
and
above
the
driver
for
the
network
card
q
if
i
have
a
novell
ne
card
are
the
lsl
and
ipx
drivers
still
needed
q
does
wwg
do
a
license
check
over
the
network
to
ensure
each
machine
is
running
its
own
licenced
copy
of
wwg
note
i
do
not
want
to
break
the
license
agreement
and
i
will
buy
a
copy
of
wwg
for
each
of
our
machines
it
is
just
that
i
would
like
to
try
it
out
first
to
see
if
it
meets
our
needs
returning
one
opened
copy
is
much
easier
than
returning
n
opened
copies
q
if
you
buy
the
upgrade
to
windows
for
wwg
does
it
replace
all
of
win
as
you
install
it
or
does
it
depend
on
current
win
files
q
if
i
install
windows
nt
on
my
server
when
it
comes
out
will
i
have
any
troubles
with
the
wwg
machines
when
i
started
this
message
i
was
going
to
ask
only
questions
but
i
got
carried
away
ill
stop
now
i
look
forward
to
your
replies
