but
i
dont
want
to
have
to
run
blasted
windows
every
time
i
want
to
delete
a
tree
it
is
absolutely
ludicrous
to
load
a
hog
like
that
just
to
delete
some
files
it
would
be
like
requiring
a
crane
to
change
the
tyre
on
a
car
you
dont
and
never
had
to
thats
what
enhanced
shells
are
for
remember
dos
and
ndos
i
mean
come
on
you
cant
expect
dos
to
cover
everything
from
r
microsoft
has
other
projects
to
work
on
they
want
you
to
move
to
windows
then
later
to
win
and
eventually
to
cairo
this
way
they
give
you
a
reason
to
by
deliberately
crippling
the
product
surely
no
oh
hold
on
i
guess
youre
right
that
certainly
stinks
of
microsoft
marketing
techniques
i
dont
think
they
deliberately
crippled
the
project
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
technical
achievement
for
what
it
does
considering
that
it
rides
on
top
of
dos
i
mean
you
get
a
gui
with
reasonable
speed
on
a
pc
with
xwindows
running
on
top
of
linux
or
something
similar
youre
still
gon
na
need
a
fast
processor
re
doss
death
well
amen
to
that
but
i
wish
it
were
a
damn
sight
deader
for
a
dead
product
its
used
an
awful
lot
and
i
suspect
its
going
to
carry
on
twitching
for
a
long
while
yet
which
isnt
doing
anyone
any
good
except
for
the
people
who
use
dos
programs
which
means
about
or
more
of
the
business
world
