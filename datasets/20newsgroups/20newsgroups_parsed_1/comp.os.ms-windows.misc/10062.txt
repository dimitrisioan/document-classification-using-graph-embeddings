thanks

i
dont
know
the
specifics
of
the
compression
algorithm
but
ive
used
the
shareware
program
paintshop
to
convert
between
the
two
you
can
download
it
from
ftpcicaindianaedu
but
i
dont
know
what
the
file
is
called
or
what
directory
it
is
in
you
can
start
by
looking
in
pubpcwin
or
try
scanning
the
index
files
to
convert
a
bmp
file
to
a
rle
file
you
just
load
the
bmp
file
and
do
a
save
as
select
windows
bitmap
and
compressed
or
is
it
rle
whatever
it
is
its
fairly
intuitive
sorry
i
dont
have
all
the
details
but
im
currently
on
an
ibm
dumb
terminal
and
cant
do
much

luck
