re
out
of
environment
space
running
bat
files
from
windows
i
have
a
bat
file
that
i
run
under
a
windows
icon
i
have
set
up
a
pif
file
to
run
the
bat
file
in
exclusive
mode
and
to
use
the
entire
screen
the
first
line
of
the
bat
file
sets
an
environment
variable
my
problem
is
that
on
some
of
our
machines
running
msdos
and
windows
in
enhanced
mode
the
set
command
in
the
bat
file
fails
with
the
out
of
environment
space
error
i
have
raised
the
amount
of
environment
space
to
bytes
using
the
shell
command
in
configsys
so
i
know
that
i
am
nowhere
near
to
running
out
from
the
windows
resource
toolkit
for
winworkgroups
add
an
entry
to
your
systemini
file
under
the
nonwindowsapp
section
commandenvsizennnn
this
sets
the
commandcom
env
size
where
nnnn
must
either
be
or
between
and
a
value
of
disables
the
setting
if
this
value
is
too
small
or
too
big
it
is
rounded
up
to
or
down
to
if
the
value
is
less
than
the
current
size
of
the
actual
environment
this
setting
is
disabled
as
if
it
were
if
you
specify
the
environment
size
in
a
pif
file
for
commandcom
the
pif
setting
overrides
this
setting
the
default
is
with
msdos
versions
earlier
than
otherwise
the
default
value
is
the
e
option
in
the
shell
command
in
configsys
to
set
this
value
you
must
edit
your
systemini
and
reboot
i
have
used
this
entry
as
well
as
relied
on
the
default
e
from
the
configsys
shell
line
and
both
give
larger
environments
if
you
dont
use
one
of
these
then
the
environment
passed
by
windows
to
each
new
dos
box
is
just
a
little
bit
bigger
than
the
environment
variables
present
when
windows
was
started
no
matter
how
big
the
dos
env
was
when
windows
starts
it
truncates
all
unused
space
except
for
a
few
bytes
this
should
allow
your
batch
file
to
run
but
your
mileage
may
vary
