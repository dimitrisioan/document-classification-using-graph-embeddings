i
know
this
is
probably
a
faq
but
i
installed
the
sw
for
my
ati
graphics
card
and
it
bashed
my
windows
logo
files
when
i
start
windows
now
it
has
the
logo
instead
of
the
logo
i
thought
the
files
that
controlled
this
were
windowssystemvgalogorle
windowssystemvgalogolgo
i
restored
these
files
but
it
didnt
change
the
logo
anyone
know
what
the
correct
files
are
thanks
somewhere
ftpcicaindianaedu
or
simtel
mirror
there
is
a
program
called
winlogozip
that
does
the
trick
it
works
great
i
believe
the
reason
why
you
cant
change
the
files
you
mentioned
is
that
the
logo
is
actually
imbeded
into
the
windows
executable
somebody
please
