i
have
a
microsoft
serial
mouse
and
am
using
mousecom
was
using
i
think
but
switched
to
to
see
if
it
was
any
better
vertical
motion
is
nice
and
smooth
but
horizontal
motion
is
so
bad
i
sometimes
cant
click
on
something
because
my
mouse
jumps
around
i
can
be
moving
the
mouse
to
the
right
with
relatively
uniform
motion
and
the
mouse
will
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
to
the
right
then
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
again
maybe
this
time
to
the
left
about
inch
this
is
crazy
i
have
never
had
so
much
trouble
with
a
mouse
before
anyone
have
any
solutions
here
is
another
hint
i
have
a
really
jumping
mouse
ps
type
and
finally
the
mouse
stops
jump
changing
himemsys
yes
himem
is
you
use
devicehimemsys
mx
x
can
be
of
course
my
computer
dont
appear
on
the
list
for
these
parameter
and
maybe
your
mouse
can
stop
jump
but
your
problem
looks
more
like
a
dirty
mouse
hope
it
help
to
anybody
