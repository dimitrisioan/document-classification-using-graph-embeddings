get
more
info
on

nt
thank
you
minghua
shan
as
far
as
i
have
read
win
nt
will
be
supported
on
intel
dec
alpha
and
the
mips
r
series
of
processors
only
i
do
remember
though
reading
a
rumour
about
sparc
support
sometime
in
the
future
i
am
not
sure
what
you

by
running
unix
applications
you
would
have
to
have
sas
for
win
nt
or
maybe
sas

according
to
the
april
issue
of
pc
magazine
pg
and
i
quote
eventually
windows
nt
is
likely
to
be
ported
to
every
successful
risc
architecture
powerpc
and
hps
parisc
are
the
two
most
likely
candidates
with
sparc
somewhat
less
likely
because
of
suns
relatively
strong
unix
software
