how
does
print
manager
deal
with
multiple
printers
were
planning
to
print
to
two
printers
from
an
application
one
will
be
a
real
printer
and
the
other
a
fax
program
will
print
manager
just
deal
with
the
jobs
one
at
a
time
or
will
it
feed
to
both
printers
at
once
please
research
carefully
just
because
a
fax
modem
behaves
like
a
printer
on
a
local
machine
doesnt
guarantee
functionality
when
a
local
machine
has
fax
software
printing
to
a
remotely
installed
fax
card
i
tried
this
with
workgroups
and
the
fax
software
didnt
like
it
at
all
could
have
been
winfaxs
peculiarisms
but
i
dont
think
so
a
lot
of
special
hardware
interaction
takes
place
internally
in
my
case
a
fax
manager
program
merely
intercepts
the
print
job
and
spools
it
to
its
own
directory
not
print
managers
spool
directory
to
software
it
appears
the
job
was
printed
print
manager
plays
no
part
in
the
handling
of
the
actual
process
pardon
me
if
ive
incorrectly
assumed
this
is
what
you
were
up
to
a
truely
networkaware
faxmodem
will
most
likely
be
required
or
a
lot
of
weird
setup
and
tinkering
good
luck
