anyway
how
about
this
i
give
you
my
word
without
naming
sources
that
ibm
paid
companies
to
write
applications
for
os
satisfied
not
really
query
what
do
you
mean
by
paid
are
you
implying
that
helped
to
offset
development
costs
or
paid
for
the
entire
cost
of
producing
the
product
i
mean
they
paid
the
companies
that
developed
the
applications
ie
well
give
you
x
million
dollars
if
you
port
application
y
to
os
i
suppose
the
company
in
question
could
use
the
x
million
dollars
for
whatever
they
want
would
you
like
to
post
figures
for
ms
as
well
i
suppose
ted
no
id
rather
not
first
of
all
i
dont
have
exact
figures
and
i
dont
want
to
disclose
how
i
know
this
however
i
will
say
that
jim
francis
from
microsoft
just
posted
a
figure
of
million
payment
from
ibm
to
borland
and
thats
somewhere
in
the
range
that
ive
heard
