very
simple
you
have
to
have
the
mousecom
or
mousesys
loaded
in
dos
before
you
run
windows
note
that
you
dont
need
to
have
these
files
loaded
to
use
the
mouse
in
windows
and
you
need
a
video
driver
which
is
completely
windows
compatible
and
your
mouse
driver
has
to
be
completely
compatible
as
well
not
quite
so
simple
i
never
could
get
my
logitech
mouse
to
work
in
a
dos
window
with
my
old
paradise
card
now
i
have
a
diamond
ssx
and
the
mouse
drivers
and
everything
works
perfectly
