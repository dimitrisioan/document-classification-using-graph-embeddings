therefore
windows
use
bit
segmented
addressing
as
a
programmer
i
agree
that
segmentation
unnecessarily
complicates
things
its
annoying
too
but
when
just
a
windows
user
i
dont
think
about
it
much
and
i
doubt
many
other
people
think
about
it
or
even
care
when
just
writing
a
document
calcing
a
spreadsheet
etcit
works
and
they
get
their
work
done
just
a
neutral
comment
its
funny
i
think
how
arguments
about
windows
vs
os
sound
so
very
similar
to
arguments
about
atheism
vs
christianity
or
something
like
that
its
somehow
very
personal
to
people
convictions
are
irrational
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
thatits
