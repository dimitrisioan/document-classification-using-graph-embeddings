norton
desktop
for
windows
on
top
of
this
it
loads
automatically
when
i
type
win
and
surely
adds
to
the
already
dismally
slow
process
of
starting
up
i
would
like
to
know
how
to
stop
or
uninstall
this
program
is
there
anyone
familiar
with
ndw
who
can
tell
me
how
to
turn
it
off
get
the
friend
to
uninstall
it
read
the
manual
though
from
your
post
i
infer
that
you
are
using
pirated
software
go
into
sysini
and
change
the
shell
line
to
read
shellprogmanexe
