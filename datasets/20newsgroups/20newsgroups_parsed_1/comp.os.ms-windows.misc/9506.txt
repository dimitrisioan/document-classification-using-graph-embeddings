this
is
in
relation
to
a
question
concerning
changing
the
registered

information
of
mswindows
in
a
previous
article
wrote
ahh
yes
this
is
a
fun
topic
no
once
the
name
is
incribed
on
the
disk
that
is
it
it
is
encoded
not
even
a
hex
editor
will
find
it
you
can
write
over
the
licensed
to
but
you
cant
change
the
name
underneth
it
i
i
can
find
it
with
a
hex
editor
although
i
have
not
tried
to
overwrite
it
are
you
sure
it
cant
be
you
may
be
mistaken
about
this
you
can
change
it
as
part
of
a
continuously
downsizing
government
organization
my
code
branch
changes
about
once
a
year
i
just
finished
changing
the
registration
information
using
norton
utilities
i
sent
the
original
requester
the
hex
offset
into
userexe
containing
the
information
and
his
reply
indicated
he
got
several
similar
answers
and
its
not
encoded
in
any
way
as
for
the
legality
theres
nothing
that
keeps
me
from
changing
the
information
it
certainly
doesnt
reach
out
and
alter
the
serial
number
printed
on
the
inside
of
my
manual
