clarify
vc
is
considered
an
upgrade
for
c
there
will
be
no
product
called
c
although
the
commandline
compiler
of
vc
lists
its
version
as
c
is
not
a
dosonly
product
it
is
a
cc
compiler
capable
of
producing
executables
for
dos
or
windows
as
is
vc
pro
ed
the
significant
difference
is
that
vc
comes
with
many
windowshosted
tools
ide
etc
which
assist
developers
in
creating
windows
executables
much
more
quickly
basically
by
automating
the
thousands
of
lines
of
boilerplate
code
initial
impressions
have
been
very
favorable
everyone
who
is
a
registered
user
of
c
should
have
received
a
considerable
amount
of
info
regarding
the
specifics
of
c
if
you
havent
call
microsoft

im
sure
theyd

happy
