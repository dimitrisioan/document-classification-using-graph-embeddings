subject
is
mswindows
a
mature
os
hi
have
you
used
mac
system
x
or
x
if
the
answer
is
positive
you
would
know
if
mswindows
is
a
mature
os
days
ago
people
doubted
that
mswindows
is
not
a
real
os
i
can
see
why
they
have
such
question
mswindows
confuses
many
people
microsoft
simulated
mac
but
it
did
a
lousy
job
for
example
you
can
not
create
hierarchy
groups
there
is
no
way
to
create
a
group
in
a
group
if
you
know
how
please
tell
me
too
many
system
parameters
to
take
care
of
uncomplete
documentation
its
not
easy
to
find
the
reason
why
causes
an
unpredictable
error
group
deletingfile
deleting
after
deleting
a
group
users
have
to
use
file
manager
to
delete
files
but
if
users
forget
to
delete
some
related
files
the
disk
will
be
full
of
nonsense
files
share
problem
once
you
create
two
windows
doing
compilation
and
editing
in
some
language
wo
good
editor
there
will
be
a
sharing
problem
you
just
can
not
open
or
save
the
program
if
it
is
loaded
it
makes
sense
to
prevent
from
saving
but
not
opening
microsoft
try
to
compromise
between
dos
and
windows
but
they
just
make
mswindows
a
graphical
dos
with
capacity
doing
mutiple
dos
jobs
the
worst
thing
is
they
complicate
the
environment
the
orginal
purpose
of
mswindows
should
be
to
simplify
the
environment
and
make
pc
easier
to
use
its
by
no
means
easy
to
satisfy
everybody
but
if
microsoft
want
to
keep
their
reputations
they
should
evaluate
the
user
interface
more
carefully
before
products
distribute
no
flame
please
jesse
