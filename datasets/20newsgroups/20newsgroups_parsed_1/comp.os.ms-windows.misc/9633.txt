hi
all
has
anybody
tried
to
compile
ctrltest
from
the
mfcsamples
directory
after
compiling
the
mfclibs
with
bwc
seems
to
me
that
bwc
isnt
able
to
distinguish
pointers
to
overloaded
functions
for
example
imagine
the
following
overloaded
functions
void
samename
void
void
samename
int
after
trying
the
whole
day
i
think
with
bwc
its
impossible
to
take
the
adress
of
one
of
the
above
two
functions
and
assign
it
to
a
properly
defined
function
pointer
am
i
right
has
anybody
else
had
this
problem
thanx
i
think
you
may
be
chasing
the
wrong
problem
i
dont
think
it
is
the
function
overloading
at
all
i
do
that
sort
of
thing
all
of
the
time
in
bc
without
a
hitch
the
big
problems
i
have
encountered
in
porting
mfc
to
bc
is
that
fact
that
mfc
depends
on
a
couple
of
invalid
c
assumptions
i
have
never
gotten
the
entire
ctrltest
app
to
run
under
bc
but
the
reason
is
that
ms
makes
some
bad
assumptions
about
the
order
in
which
staticglobal
objects
are
initialized
ie
some
objects
are
getting
accessed
before
they
are
initialized
the
problem
is
in
the
ownerdraw
menu
code
somewhere
if
you
comment
out
that
section
all
other
pieces
of
ctrltest
work
fine
two
other
major
gotchas
i
have
found
using
mfc
under
bc
the
cfileopenflags
enum
uses
hardcoded
numbers
for
the
open
mode
rather
than
the
manifest
constants
defined
in
fcntrlh
which
differ
between
msc
and
bc
all
of
the
mfc
collection
classes
depend
on
another
bad
c
assumption
that
a
reference
to
a
base
object
can
used
be
in
place
of
a
reference
to
a
derived
object
true
for
pointers
not
for
references
i
am
sure
there
are
other
problems
along
the
same
lines
but
i
have
not
encountered
them
yet
i
have
not
seen
mfc
yet
but
i
hope
that
some
of
these
will
be
addressed
if
they
are
not
all
of
mss
hype
about
portability
to
other
vendors
compilers
will
be
just
that
if
these
were
my
employers
opinions
i
wouldnt
be
posting
them
whoever
said
nothing
lasts
forever
was
obviously
