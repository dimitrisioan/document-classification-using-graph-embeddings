i
wont
dispute
now
but
pray
tell
if
you
know
for
a
fact
anything
why
dont

provided
some
insight
into
your
source

you
think
that
will
accept
it
for
fact

i
would
if
you
gave
your
word
even
mike

responds
if
he
says
he
knows
for
a
fact
what
more
do
you
have
to
gain
if
he
gives
his
word
do
you
think
hes
lying
right
now
while
i
do
not
think
he
is
lying
i
also
feel
hesitant
to
take
anybody
on
their
word
unless
they
can
attribute
a
source
for
thier
claims
with
all
the
fud
and
misinformations
and
misconceptions
and
outright
lies
flying
around
the
advocacy
newsgroups
i
do
not
trust
any
unsubstantiated
rumor
or
claim
especially
from
any
employees
of
ibms
or
microsoft
or
anyone
who
seems
to
have
a
vested
interest
divya

live
long
and

a
slow
and
horrible
death
