groups
salutations
i
dont
usually
subscribe
to
these
newsgroups
so
i
would
really
appreciate
it
if
someone
could
possibly
email
me
the
answer
to
my
problem
i
have
been
using
windows
since
buying
it
last
winter
but
i
have
just
now
come
across
an
annoying
bug
i
now
have
about
different
groups
in
program
manager
but
it
seems
that
everytime
i
install
something
new
that
makes
a
new
group
it
promptly
disappears
after
i
turn
of
windows
this
happened
when
i
installed
excel
and
winfax
pro
v
they
both
created
their
own
groups
but
when
i
turned
off
windows
and
reran
them
they
were
gone
i
had
to
manually
pull
them
up
as
new
items
and
put
them
in
a
previously
existing
group
as
all
new
gropus
disappear
as
soon
as
i
turn
off
windows
