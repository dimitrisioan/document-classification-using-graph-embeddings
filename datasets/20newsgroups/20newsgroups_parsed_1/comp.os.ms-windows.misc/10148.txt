am
getting
exceedingly
frustrated
that
my
applications
are
not
giving
back
system
resources
when
i
close
them
ive
noticed
this
also
the
way
it
was
explained
to
me
is
that
windows
does
not
clear
the
upper
memory
blocks
after
a
program
is
done
anyone
out
there
know
if
this
is
why
there
was
a
post
about
something
similar
a
while
back
it
seems
windows
does
not
take
it
upon
itself
to
free
up
any
sys
resources
an
applllication
is
using
when
that
application
is
done
that
job
is
left
entirely
to
the
application
that
is
the
application
has
to
clean
up
after
itself
when
it
quits
anyone
out
there
know
if
there
is
a
utility
for
windows
which
will
clean
up
sys
resources
when
an
application
quits
