ati

ultra
questions
etc
to
those
interested
in
the
new
ati
ultra
cards
i
had
posted
some
questions
regarding
the
new
ati
ultra
pro
cards
and
had
asked
confirmation
of
some
opinions
this
message
is
a
summary
of
the
responses
thanks
to
all
of
you
that
replied
the
card
does
not
work
in
a
system
with
m
ram
a
the
higher
memory
limits
apply
to
isa
cards
only
as
far
as
i
know
the
vlb
and
eisa
version
should
have
no
problems
b
im
pretty
sure
from
my
experience
that
the
isa
version
doesnt
work
in
systems
with
over
m
ram
there
is
supposed
to
be
way
of
switching
the
memory
aperture
feature
off
to
prevent
this
but
apparently
it
doesnt
work
i
posted
some
help
me
messages
on
the
net
and
people
indicated
that
the
eisa
card
didnt
have
this
problem
c
false
d
the
vlb
card
which
i
have
allows
you
to
set
memory
aperture
over
m
by
using
their
configuration
software
no
messing
with
jumpers
necessary
the
m
problem
is
probably
valid
only
for
isa
cards
the
card
works
in
a
m
system
with
some
switches
set
but
it
is
much
slower
a
again
the
memory
aperture
need
only
be
disabled
if
you
have
more
than
m
ram
eisa
and
vlb
or
m
isa
m
should
not
be
a
problem
for
you
b
dunno
c
depends
on
the
bus
yes
if
isa
no
if
eisa
or
localbus
the
card
is
interlaced
in
its
bit
truecolour
modes
a
nope
i
can
use
x
at
hz
bit
and
x
at
hz
bit
all
noninterlaced
b
yes
according
to
pc
magazine
theyve
tested
a
local
bus
version
that
does
x
in
bit
which
may
or
may
not
be
interlaced
c
not
for
the
pro
sometimes
for
the
plus
some
modes
may
run
only
interlaced
on
certain
monitors
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
bits
only
with
screen
size
note
that
for
bit
color
and
windows
you
must
have
megs
memory
size
calculations
notwithstanding
the
latest
build
drivers
still
do
not
work
in
many
cases
a
they
arent
perfect
but
are
much
improved
i
dont
recall
the
last
time
which
i
had
to
leave
mach
mode
ati
gup
mode
and
switch
to
or
vga
mode
due
to
software
incompatibility
b
true
many
people
recommended
going
back
to
build
or
c
they
appear
to
be
excellent
but
have
a
few
bugs
for
example
certain
graphs
with
dashed
lines
in
mathcad
do
not
print
correctly
though
they
do
display
ok
on
the
screen
they
are
about
par
for
fancy
cards
other
accelerated
cards
also
have
bugs
d
overall
i
like
the
card
even
if
driver
performance
is
somewhat
less
than
satisfactory
i
am
running
the
color
mode
as
that
is
all
my
nt
driver
for
october
nt
version
seems
to
allow
i
will
say
this
that
color
performance
is
not
quite
as
nice
as
a
diamond
stealth
vram
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
try
out
a
lot
of
the
options
on
the
old
driver
this
card
is
the
fastest
full
colour
card
for
the
money
a
its
quite
fast
but
whether
or
not
its
the
fastest
is
open
to
debate
b
yes
ill
admit
it
was
very
very
fast
in
bit
mode
which
is
what
i
wanted
to
use
it
for
too
bad
it
crashed
in
many
different
ways
every
minutes
or
so
c
depends
on
many
many
things
this
card
is
the
greatest
thing
since
sliced
bread
a
i
like
it
b
well
pc
magazine
seems
to
think
it
is
c
yes
this
appears
to
be
true
d
as
to
greatest
thing
since
sliced
bread
i
doubt
it
better
cards
are
coming
out
who
knows
maybe
ati
will
come
out
with
something
faster
yet
several
reviews
i
read
rated
one
pycon
winjet
card
as
a
superior
performer
at
a
cheaper
price
except
for
availability
of
drivers
which
pycon
was
developing
at
that
time
pc
magazine
about
two
months
or
so
back
overall
the
card
has
a
lot
of
potential
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
use
it
that
is
the
end
of
the
questions
these
were
the
most
discussed
items
in
this
group
so
i
thought
they
needed
confirmation
for
those
of
you
not
familiar
with
the
card
i
have
included
a
summary
