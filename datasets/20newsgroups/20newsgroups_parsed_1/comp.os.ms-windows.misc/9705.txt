dear
friend
the
risc
means
reduced
instruction
set
computer
the
risc
usually
has
small
instruction
set
so
as
to
reduce
the
circuit
complex
and
can
increase
the
clock
rate
to
have
a
high
performance
you
can
read
some
books
about
computer
architecture
for
more
information
about
risc
hmm
not
that
i
am
an
authority
on
risc
but
i
clearly
remember
reading
that
the
instruction
set
on
risc
cpus
is
rather
large
the
difference
is
in
addressing
modes
risc
instruction
sets
are
not
as
orthogonal
is
cisc
the
original
riscs
had
small
instruction
sets
and
simple
ones
the
idea
was
that
a
every
instruction
should
be
completable
in
a
single
clock
cycle
and
b
to
have
no
microcode
and
c
extensive
pipelines

while
researching
for
the
vlsi
vax
dec
discovered
that
of
the
vax
microcode
is
there
to
support
of
the
instruction
set
which
accounted
for
a
mere
of
all
instructions
executed
the
uvax
subsetted
the
architecture
onto
a
single
chip
and
used
a
software
emulator
for
these
very
complex
instructions
the
