im
sure
everyone
who
has
an
uncompressed
part
of
their
compressed
hard
disk
has
seen
the
message
you
have
selected
a
swap
file
greater
than
the
suggested
sizewindows
will
only
use
the
size
suggesteddo
you
want
to
create
this
swap
file
anyway
or
something
like
that
well
a
friend
of
mine
robert
called
microsoft
and
asked
them
what
and
why
what
they
said
is
that
windows
checks
the
amount
of
free
disk
space
and
divides
that
number
by
then
it
checks
for
the
largest
contiguous
block
of
free
disk
space
windows
then
suggests
the
smaller
of
the
two
numbers
they
also
said
that
under
absolutely
no
circumstancesnonewill
windows
uses
a
swap
file
larger
than
the
suggested
size
wellthats
what
he
said
i
call
if
this
is
true
why
does
windows
report
the
memory
is
available
to
me
if
its
not
going
to
use
it
i
think
the
support
droid
was
malfunctioning
and
confused
the
disk
space
limit
with
the
virtual
address
space
limit
as
far
as
the
disk
is
concerned
you
are
limited
only
by
the
amount
of
contiguous
free
space
the
limit
that
causes
the
message
windows
will
only
use
is
the
amount
of
virtual
address
space
that
the
virtual
memory
manager
will
create
and
this
is
a
function
of
the
amount
of
free
memory
that
you
have
when
windows
starts
in
the
enh
section
of
systemini
you
can
specify
a
parameter
pageovercommitmultiplier
the
following
description
is
from
the
windows
resource
kit
this
entry
specifies
the
multiplier
what
determines
the
amount
of
linear
address
space
the
vmm
will
create
for
the
system
which
is
computed
by
rounding
up
the
amount
of
available
physical
memory
to
the
nearest
mb
and
then
multiplying
that
value
by
the
value
specified
for
pageovercommit
increasing
this
value
increases
the
amount
of
available
linear
address
space
causing
the
size
of
data
structures
to
increase
this
also
increases
paging
activity
proportionately
and
can
slow
down
the
system
you
can
specify
a
value
between
and
the
default
is
to
change
this
entry
you
must
edit
