hotkey
for
screen
saver
is
there
a
hotkey
for
the
windows
screen
saver
utility
if
not
is
there
an
easy
way
to
create
one
the
reason
that
i
need
one
is
that
my
dads
company
is
anal
retentive
about
leaving
a
computer
while
the
information
can
be
accessed
so
the
employees
are
not
allowed
to
walk
away
from
the
computer
until
the
screen
saver
kicks
in
as
if
that
is
terribly
secure
also
the
system
manager
wont
let
any
software
be
added
so
another
program
such
as
lockzip
from
cica
or
a
different
screen
saver
is
out
thanks
for
any
and
all
help
