i
have
been
experiencing
several
enduser
problems
with
various
commercial
software
packages
wordperfect
win
publish
itwin
and
printing
landscape
mode
on
a
citizen
pn
the
little
guy
or
the
citizen
gsx
in
a
nutshell
the
problem
is
that
i
lose
the
first
inches
of
information
from
my
left
margin
be
it
white
space
or
truetype
font
output
and
margins
are
not
preserved
on
subsequent
pages
past
the
first
wordperfect
had
a
workaround
consisting
of
using
the
default
location
for
the
printers
instead
of
tractor
or
manual
they
have
also
filed
this
as
a
bug
and
are
continuing
to
investigate
it
ms
write
of
course
has
no
problem
with
these
printer
drivers
proving
that
microsoft
knows
something
the
rest
of
us
dont
are
you
surprised
im
not
publish
itwin
is
still
investigating
this
problem
and
while
i
was
consider
my
options
rejecting
the
one
about
buying
an
dtp
package
for
surely
they
wouldnt
have
this
problem
right
i
stumbled
onto
a
global
workaround
workaround
go
into
the
windows
control
panel
select
printers
select
your
citizen
printer
driver
select
setup
and
select
a
custom
size
of
x
like
magic
all
of
your
problems
will
go
away
ask
me
no
questions
and
ill
tell
you
no
lies

excuse
me
