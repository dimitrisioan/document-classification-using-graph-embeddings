we
are
using
pkzip
v
and
i
am
interested
to
hear
from
people
who
have
used
one
of
the
many
windows
programs
that
call
these
which
ones
are
available
and
does
any
one
stand
out
amongst
the
rest
is
there
a
full
windows
version
that
does
not
call
the
dos
pkzippkunzip
commands
do
you
mean
a
prog
that
doesnt
jump
to
the
dos
display
and
then
back
or
create
a
temp
dos
window
if
yes
then
i
might
recommend
winzip
from
ftpcicaindianaedu
im
afraid
i
dont
have
the
file
name
or
version
but
you
should
be
able
to
find
it
its
fully
compatible
with
ver
g
and
very
functional
