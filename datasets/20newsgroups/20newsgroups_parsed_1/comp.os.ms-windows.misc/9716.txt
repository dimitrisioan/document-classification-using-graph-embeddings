ive
been
reading
with
much
confusion
about
whether
or
not
to
use
atmanager
lately
all
the
packages
ive
been
buying
have
all
included
atmanager
as
a
bonus
adobe
has
been
doing
this
for
years
i
do
some
desktop
publishing
using
pagemaker
and
coreldraw
coreldraw
comes
with
a
nifty
laser
disk
that
contains
over
diff
types
add
that
to
the
ttfonts
that
come
with
win
and
you
have
a
decent
amount
of
fonts
i
print
my
creations
out
on
an
hp
postcript
at
dpi
resolution
with
the
resolution
enhancement
technology
and
well
i
get
some
darn
good
copies
so
good
that
there
isnt
any
diff
whether
or
not
atmanager
is
turned
on
or
not
is
it
worth
it
to
run
atm
at
all
especially
with
these
better
printer
technologies
and
tt
there
are
some
fonts
that
are
only
available
as
ps
fonts
if
you
have
a
ps
font
that
you
want
to
use
use
atm
otherwise
it
is
a
waste
of
system
resources
personally
i
use
both
