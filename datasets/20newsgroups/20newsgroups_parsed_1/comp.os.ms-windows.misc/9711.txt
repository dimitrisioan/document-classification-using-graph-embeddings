a
script
under

i
will
use
the
utility
for
updating
the
winini
and
other
files
on
meny
pcs
do
i
find
it
on
any
ftp
host
svein
well
in
the
latest
windows
magazine
there
is
an
advertisement
for
a
program
that
will
help
you
uninstall
windows
apps
from
your
harddisk
uninstaller
but
it
can
be
used
to
update
a
network
but
only
for
deleting
not
adding
or
changing
their
ini
files
uninstaller
by
microhelp
inc
i
am
also
looking
for
an
ini
updater
for
my
pc
network
and
so
far
without
any
luck
so
for
the
time
being
i
have
been
pushing
dos
and
its
batch
language
to
its
limitlook
into
dos
s
i
am
assumming
that
dos
has
the
same
command

even
moreor
lessimproved
replace
command
i
use
this
to
update
our
users
personal
files
with
a
master
set
in
a
batch
file
that
is
run
everytime
they
invoke

overwrites
their
color
schemes
