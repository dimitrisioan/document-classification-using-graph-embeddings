question
about
localtalkappleshare
on
msdos
system
is
anyone
out
there
running
a
msdos
system
with
a
localtalk
board
i
am
on
an
appletalk
network
hooked
up
with
a
daystar
digital
lt
mc
localtalk
interface
board
running
on
a
ps
model
im
using
the
appleshare
pc
software
for
file
server
and
network
access
it
works
fine
under
dos
or
the
window
or
os
dos
box
but
when
i
try
to
load
it
before
windows
so
that
every
application
i
run
could
get
access
to
it
the
machine
crashes
hard
as
soon
as
i
start
up
an
application
and
of
course
things
look
pretty
hopeless
for
os
but
who
knows
so
does
anyone
have
experience
with
this
bizarre
and
obsolete
setup
duncan
