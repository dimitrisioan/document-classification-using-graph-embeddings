re
win
nt
what
is
it
can
anyone
tell
me
how
chicagowindows
would
differ
from
os
x
believe
it
or
not
im
not
trying
to
start
a
flame
war
here
im
simply
curious
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
feature
advantage
in
either
of
these
products
i
do
not
consider
the
fact
that
it
has
uncle
bills
seal
of
approval
much
of
a
feature
one
difference
will
probably
be
the
same
difference
as
between
os
and
windows
x
nowone
will
likely
have
a
lot
of
software
available
for
it
and
one
wont
emulation
with
the
inevitable
incompatibilities
that
crop
up
in
spite
of
all
the
contrary
claims
just
doesnt
count
when
you
have
to
use
a
certain
software
package
that
doesnt
quite
run
properly
under
the
emulation
developers
want
to
channel
their
resources
toward
a
platform
that
has
a
large
installed
base
and
in
a
case
like
that
the
platform
that
is
most
successfully
marketed
regardless
of
its
relative
sophistication
will
win
lamont
downs
