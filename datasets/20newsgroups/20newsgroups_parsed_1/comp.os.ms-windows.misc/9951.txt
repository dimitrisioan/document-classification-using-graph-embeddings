ami
pro
and
pctools
compress
doesnt
like
being
moved
has
anyone
had
problems
with
ami
pro
after
running
pctools
v
compress
i
have
not
corrupted
data
due
to
having
caches
other
than
pccache
running
so
that
is
not
it
the
first
time
i
try
to
run
ami
pro
after
loading
windows
it
loads
but
causes
i
think
it
was
a
segmentation
fault
in
amiproexe
right
before
it
finishes
with
all
times
after
that
only
managing
to
get
to
the
logo
box
that
first
pops
up
when
it
begins
loading
and
then
causes
a
general
protection
fault
in
module
amiprouidll
at
i
have
not
been
able
to
fix
this
problem
except
by
reinstalling
ami
pro
this
has
happened
twice
with
both
times
being
after
having
ran
compress
on
my
hard
drive
btw
i
am
not
running
stacker
or
any
other
disk
compression
programs
and
if
you
dont
already
know
pctools
compress
is
actually
a
defragger
despite
its
name
my
system
is
a
mhz
with
mb
of
ram
and
a
nec
oem
hard
drive
etc
but
that
shouldnt
make
a
difference
please
email
me
as
i
cant
keep
up
with
the
newsgroup
and
it
will
cut
down
on
net
traffic
anyways
thanks
derek
