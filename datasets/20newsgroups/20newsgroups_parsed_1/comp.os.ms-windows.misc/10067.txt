help
finding
best
development
kit
im
new
to
the
mswindows
world
and
while
a
fairly
competent
sparcnextstep
programmer
i
have
no
idea
which
development
kit
to
purchase
i
have
heard
good
things
about
borland
c
with
application
frameworks
and
microsofts
visual
c
with
sdk
what
i
would
like
is
peoples
comments
on
which
package
or
set
of
tools
they
find
useful
or
productive
and
why
there
are
a
plethora
of
other
kits
such
as
gui
toolkits
available
and
im
wondering
which
of
these
are
best
in
terms
of
reliability
plug
and
go
type
operation
readability
and
so
on
id
be
interested
in
comments
on
these
or
anything
else
you
may
find
useful
i
will
summarize
to
the
net
if
there
is
enough
interest
thanks
