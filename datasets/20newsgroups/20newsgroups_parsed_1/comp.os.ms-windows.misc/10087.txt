writes
any
clue
some
times
when
i
enter
win
progman
says
that
i
need
to
rebuild
a
group
its
quite
annoying
ive
had
the
same
problem
with
a
maxtor
a
turned
off
smartdrive
bit
disk
access
etc
this
same
disk
aborts
norton
speed
disk
nu
up
to
times
requesting
ndd
to
be
run
when
attempting
to
defrag
drive
at
some
peoples
suggestion
i
reformatted
my
drive
and
reloaded
dos
win
from
scratch
a
few
people
found
that
installing
on
top
of
beta
on
top
of
caused
a
similar
problem
so
i
tried
this
drastic
solution
when
the
problem
reoccurred
i
didnt
have
the
brains
not
to
load
and
dblespaced
the
drive
i
get
arround
the
annoyance
by
copying
my
grp
files
to
gro
when
i
get
the
message
i
run
file
manager
and
copy
the
offeniding
group
files
from
gro
ove
rthe
grp
then
i
quit
and
restart
windowsif
the
group
is
an
often
used
important
one
this
really
sucks
but
im
pretty
sure
that
the
problem
is
the
drive
especially
with
the
nsd
problem
i
will
be
going
with
out
over
of
my
memory
after
finals
for
to
weeks
while
the
guy
i
bought
the
disk
and
system
from
goes
over
it
and
either
fixes
it
or
replaces
the
drive
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
system
that
will
run
consistently
with
all
hte
goodies
