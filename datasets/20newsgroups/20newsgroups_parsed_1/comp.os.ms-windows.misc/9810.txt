writes
so
good
that
there
isnt
any
diff
whether
or
not
atmanager
is
turned
on
or
not
is
it
worth
it
to
run
atm
at
all
especially
with
these
better
printer
technologies
and
tt
there
are
some
fonts
that
are
only
available
as
ps
fonts
if
you
have
a
ps
font
that
you
want
to
use
use
atm
otherwise
it
is
a
waste
of
system
resources
or
if
you
need
to
use
a
service
bureau
and
theyre
only
set
up
to
use
type
fonts
from
what
ive
heard
pure
hearsay
the
results
of
outputting
tt
fonts
as
type
is
not
as
good
as
using
highquality
type
fonts
in
the
first
place
unless
you
print
to
file
with
the
correct
resolution
set
for
the
final
output
device
image
setter
a
problem
with
tt
fonts
in
windows
is
that
they
do
get
converted
to
t
format
ok
and
the
hinting
is
even
used
while
this
is
done
but
the
resulting
t
fonts
are
not
hinted
the
result
is
that
they
will
work
fine
on
a
device
of
the
resolution
assumed
by
the
printer
driver
when
the
ps
file
is
generated
but
they
will
not
look
good
when
printed
at
a
different
resolution
so
when
you
print
to
an
attached
ps
printer
with
the
ps
driver
set
up
for
this
printer
results
may
be
quite
good
but
if
you
take
a
ps
file
made
for
that
printer
and
run
it
on
a
device
of
different
resolution
such
as
an
image
setter
then
the
results
may
not
be
so
good
