long
i
have
been
posting
monthly
howtosetup
a
slip
client
on
a
pc
posts
for
a
few
months
lots
of
work
and
imminent
graduation
have
come
in
the
way
of
posting
one
of
these
for
march
or
earlier
this
month
for
which
i
apologize
this
file
includes
information
on
writing
a
script
for
university
of
minnesota
phone
and
also
a
batch
file
hack
that
lets
you
use
other
packet
drivers
with
phone
for
additions
modifications
and
corrections

begin
sliptxt
based
on
my
experiences
on
setting
up
slip
under
dos
and
windows
here
are
my
comments
on
setting
up
slip
in
this
environment
i
thank
the
trumpet
beta
testers
and
the
cwru
slip
beta
testers
for
their
comments
configuring
your
modem
a
turn
off
dtr
atdw
i
have
to
disable
dtr
because
the
communication
program
that
i
use
to
dial
my
slip
server
qmodem
drops
dtr
when
i
exit
the
program
and
therefore
hangs
up
the
line
if
you
use
a
program
like
kermit
or
conex
to
establish
the
slip
connection
then
this
need
not
be
done
these
programs
do
not
necessarily
hangup
the
line
when
you
exit
note
if
you
use
univ
of
minn
phone
to
dial
and
establish
a
slip
connection
you
do
not
need
to
turn
off
dtr
b
dial
and
establish
the
slip
connection
first
this
can
be
done
automatically
if
you
use
a
program
like
phone
from
the
university
of
minnesota
which
will
dial
and
establish
a
slip
connection
then
load
the
slip
packet
driver
the
phone
scripting
language
is
simple
and
phone
scripts
can
be
easily
written
to
configure
phone
to
work
with
other
slip
server
in
addition
while
the
only
packet
driver
that
phone
works
with
is
umslip
currently
it
is
easy
to
write
a
batch
file
hack
that
lets
phone
work
with
other
packet
drivers
there
is
a
section
on
phone
in
the
document
with
both
script
and
batch
file
examples
configuring
the
slip
drivers
there
are
five
slip
packet
drivers
commonly
available
cslipperexe
peter
tattams
compressed
slip
driver
slipperexe
peter
tattams
slip
driver
slipcom
crynwr
driver
i
like
phil
burns
modified
driver
etherslcom
crynwr
driver
ethernet
simulation
over
slip
umslipcom
univ
of
minnesota
driver
based
on
slip
of
these
four
i
vastly
prefer
cslipperexe
over
slipcom
or
etherslcom
for
the
following
reasons
a
it
is
much
faster
even
though
my
modem
has
just
a
uart
b
while
using
etherslipslipumslip
myself
and
several
others
have
noticed
that
the
pc
clock
gets
messed
up
after
performing
a
long
ftp
transfer
c
it
supports
pktmux
when
used
in
ethernet
simulation
mode
d
when
used
in
ethernet
simulation
mode
cslipper
seem
to
work
with
every
tcpip
application
that
i
have
tested
it
with
instructions
for
cslipperexe
and
you
do
not
use
phone
a
load
slipper
in
your
autoexecbat
file
according
to
instructions
for
instance
if
you
have
a
vbis
modem
on
com
slipper
com
vec
baud
b
if
you
use
dos
tcpip
applications
in
win
dos
boxes
then
use
the
doubleended
packet
driver
shim
winpktcom
this
creates
a
virtual
packet
driver
at
x
dos
applications
in
native
mode
dos
applications
in
windows
dos
boxes
and
windows
applications
can
all
use
this
virtual
driver
at
x
winpktcom
x
x
c
if
you
use
qvtnet
load
pktintcom
next
qvtnet
is
configured
in
qvtnetini
to
use
the
interrupt
at
x
pktintcom
instructions
for
slipcom
a
try
getting
a
version
slip
driver
philip
burns
of
northwestern
university
has
a
modified
slipcom
driver
that
is
better
at
hardware
handshaking
this
driver
is
distributed
along
with
nupop
b
load
the
driver
after
establishing
the
slip
connection
my
modem
is
a
vbis
modem
on
com
so
here
is
how
i
would
load
the
driver
slip
w
x
h
slip
xf
c
as
discussed
above
if
you
use
dos
tcpip
applications
in
windows
x
dos
boxes
you
probably
want
to
use
winpktcom
winpktcom
x
x
d
if
you
use
winqvtnet
load
pktintcom
pktintcom
instructions
for
etherslcom
if
you
choose
to
use
etherslcom
instead
of
slipcom
the
instructions
are
exactly
the
same
with
one
crucial
difference
you
will
have
to
delete
the
line
devicevcd
from
the
enh
section
of
systemini
this
will
interfere
with
running
regular
windows
comm
applications
such
as
crosstalk
and
you
will
get
lots
of
dropped
characters
etc
in
these
applications
this
is
therefore
not
recommended
etherslip
would
be
loaded
as
ethersl
w
x
h
xf
configuring
windows
a
make
the
following
modifications
to
the
systemini
file
enh
section
i
list
all
your
com
ports
with
their
addresses
and
interrupts
combasef
comirq
combasef
comirq
combasee
comirq
this
can
also
be
done
from
within
windows
control
panel
but
doubleclicking
on
the
ports
icon
ii
give
the
port
to
which
your
modem
is
attached
a
generous
com
buffer
combuffer
iii
change
the
com
port
autoassign
value
for
the
com
port
that
you
wish
to
use
for
your
modem
to
zero
this
is
the
amount
of
time
that
windows
waits
in
seconds
before
handing
control
of
that
com
port
to
another
application
if
you
use
winqvtnet
and
then
want
to
switch
from
one
session
to
another
and
this
value
is
at
the
default
value
of
seconds
you
are
will
get
a
gpf
and
windows
will
crash
comautoassign
this
can
also
be
done
from
within
windows
control
panel
doubleclick
on
enhanced
and
under
device
contention
set
the
device
contention
for
the
com
port
your
modem
is
on
to
never
warn
additional
notes
what
to
do
if
you
are
assigned
a
different
ip
address
for
each
slip
session
i
am
fortunate
in
that
our
campus
slip
server
assigns
each
user
a
permanent
ip
address
so
i
do
not
have
worry
about
editing
qvtnetini
each
time
that
i
establish
a
slip
connection
if
you
are
assigned
a
new
ip
address
on
every
occasion
that
you
dial
in
please
try
to
use
bootp
aware
software
and
let
bootp
do
the
configuration
for
you
however
qvtnet
is
not
bootp
aware
and
rarp
will
not
work
over
a
slip
connection
to
get
qvtnet
working
in
a
situation
such
as
this
you
must
do
the
following
edit
the
qvtnetini
file
let
the
net
section
look
like
this
net
name
ip
netmask
or
whatever
is
appropriate
for
you
arptime
packetvector
or
whatever
is
appropriate
save
the
changes
and
then
writeprotect
this
file
attrib
r
qvtnetini
start
your
slip
connection
and
remember
the
name
and
ip
address
that
you
are
assigned
each
time
you
start
qvtnet
x
the
general
configuration
dialog
box
will
open
enter
the
name

ip
address
and
you
were
assigned
for
that

click
on

you
should
be

running
the

you
make
will
not
be

an
example
of
this
configuration
is
shown
below
the
latest
release
of

is

and
it
is
important
that
you
use
this
version
if
you
want
to

my

this
is
what

reads

i
have
similar
batch
files
that
load

tcpip
applications
like

gopher
it
is
my
experience
that
pktmux
works
fine
even
if
the
virtual
packet
drivers
in
two
independent
virtual
dos
sessions
are
loaded
at
the
same
software
interrupt
for
example
within
two

for

other

how
much
does
pktmux
degrade
the
performance
of
cslipper
i
have
a
vbisvbis
modem
in
a
running
windows
with
a
reasonably
fast
video
card
ati
graphics

under

conditions
when
i
have
three
virtual

loaded
and
being
used
as
follows
a

driver
at

in
another
dos

trumpet
for
dos
i
get
ftp
transfer
rates
of
kbsec
while
transferring
compressed
files
this
rate
is
comparable
to
that
which
i
get
with
slip
loaded
as
a
packet
driver
and
where
a
single
tcpip
session
is
active
if
cslipper
is
used
a
packet
driver
and
a
single
session
is
active
i
get
transfer
rates
of
kbsec
on
the
same
files
while
there
is
about
degradation
in
the
performance
of
slipper
for
me
the
benefits
of
being
able
to
use
pktmux
outweigh
the
performance
hit
cslipper
and
ethernet
simulation
mode
in
ethernet
simulation
mode
cslipper
ver
works
with
all
the
applications
that
i
have
tested
it
with
one
or
two
applications
that
required
ethernet
simulation
balked
at
cslipper
but
even
these
rare
problems
have
been
resolved
with
ver
when
slipper
is
used
in
ethernet
simulation
mode
and
used
with
pktmux
i
get
some
an
error
message
in
the
qvtnet
console
window
that
reads
ipincorrect
packet
type
or
ipbad
version
number
this
does
not
seem
to
prevent
qvtnet
from
functioning
although
i
can
not
comment
on
loss
of
performance
what
can
you
do
if
your
dos
tcpip
application
does
not
work
with
cslipper
in
ethernet
simulation
mode
in
the
rare
event
that
you
find
a
package
that
does
not
work
with
cslipper
in
ethernet
simulation
mode
first
contact
the
author
peter
tattam
and
let
him
know
chances
are
that
he
can
fix
it
in
the
meanwhile
you
can
try
the
following
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
kosher
but
it
worked
when
i
had
problems
with
cslipper
ver
cslipper
is
loaded
at
x
as
described
above
under
the
pktmux
section
i
load
etherslcom
at
x
run
the
application
and
then
terminate
etherslcom
this
also
works
within
windows
virtual
dos
boxes
however
a
packet
driver
like
ethersl
can
be
used
in
only
one
virtual
dos
box
at
a
time
so
for
example
here
is
my
batch
file
to
run
grateful
med
a
medical
reference
retrieval
program
developed
at
the
national
library
of
medicine
ethersl
w
x
h
xf
loads
etherslip
cd
gm
search
cd
termin
x
terminates
etherslip
exit
closes
the
dos
box
and
returns
me
to
windows
if
you
use
this
method
be
cautious
about
one
thing
dont
have
any
active
pktmux
dos
sessions
open
at
the
same
time
after
closing
the
ethersl
window
you
can
run
your
pktmux
dos
sessions
with
no
problem
btw
the
example
above
grateful

with
no
problems
with

ver
phone
script
files
the
documentation
that
accompany
phone
provide
good
instructions
on
writing
script
files
to
get
phone
to
dial
slip
servers
other
than
the
university
of
minnesota
server
for
example
here
is
a
script
that
i
use
to
dial
a
cisco
server
at
the
university
that
i
attend
background
to
start
a
slip
connection
i
dial
our
terminal
server
and
login
with
a

after
doing
so
i

how
to
use
packet
drivers
other
than
umslip
with
phone
the
quick
answer
there
is
no
clean
way
below
is
a
batch
file
hack
that
i
wrote
to
use
phone
with
other
packet
drivers
in
this
example
the
packet
driver
is
peter
tattams
cslipper
to
use
a
batch
file
like
this
you
must
know
the
parameters
with
which
you
plan
to
use
the
packet
driver
ie
interrupt
vector
baud
rate
port
address
and
irq
this
batch
file
requires
umslipcom
cslipperexe
and
termincom
to
be
in
the
same
directory
or
in
your
path
all
that
the
batch
file
does
is
to
let
you
dial
the
slip
connection
using
phone
load
the
appropriate
packet
driver
hangup
the
connection
and
unload
the
driver
when
you
