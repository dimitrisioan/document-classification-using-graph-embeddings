while
working
on
my
shareware
toolbar
i
found
myself
eating
resources
and
a
very
wise
person
pointed
me
to
the
sdk
and
specifically
the
debug
kernel
once
you
have
all
the
sdk
stuff
installed
this
also
comes
with
vc
you
run
nd
which
does
a

swap
the
debug
kernel
runs

slower
but
you
then
execute
the
command
dbwin
and
let
it
report
to
you
what
is
going
on
you
are
going
to
find
out
a
lot
more
about
your
apps
than
you
cared
to
and
possibly
about
other
peoples
apps
is
that

this
doesnt
