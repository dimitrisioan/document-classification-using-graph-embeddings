hello
im
investigating
the
purchase
of
an
object
oriented
application
framework
i
have
come
across
a
few
that
look
good
zinc
has
a
platform
independent
resource
strategy
not
too
important
for
me
right
now
just
a
thought
on
resources
it
is
very
important
if
you
do
use
a
multiplatform
toolkit
to
check
on
how
it
uses
resources
i
have
used
glockenspeil
commonview
under
motif
and
os
i
wrote
a
resource
converter
from
os
to
motif
but
it
really
wasnt
too
easy
especially
the
naming
scheme
in
motif
you
can
not
rename
controlswidgets
with
windows
you
can
call
the
ok
button
idok
in
every
instance
this
doesnt
work
for
motif
youd
have
to
call
it
dialogok
and
motif
expects
a
text
string
rather
than
a
number
so
your
constructor
should
know
how
to
convert
a
define
into
the
proper
resource
identifier
id
check
on
how
the
toolkit
expects
names
and
that
if
it
does
use
resources
that
is
uses
resources
for
all
platforms
you
intend
to
port
to
by
the
way
i
would
never
use
commonview
or
glockenspiel
for
anything
