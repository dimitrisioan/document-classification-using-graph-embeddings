had
posted
that
it
came
from
a
survey
of
registered

i
doublechecked
with
a
friendly
neighborhood
marketing
type
and
found
there
were
actually
two
surveys
one
of
randomly
selected
resellers
one
of
randomly
selected
users
from
the
upgrade
registered
user
database
both
surveys
showed
a
positive
rating
jen
include
stdisclaimer
msdos
testing
which
translates
to
not
satisfied
i
dont
think
its
the
awkward
recursive
deletion
thats
bugging
people
it
certainly
isnt
the
nice
windows
interfaces
for
new
dos
accessories
cpav
defrager
undelete
as
far
as
ive
noticed
its
doublespace
crashes
frankly
the
fairly
high
rates
of
doublespace
crashes
ive
heard
of
surprises
me
i
figured
that
since
the
os
is
presumably
aware
of
doublespace
it
is
less
likely
to
crash
unlike
stacker
which
fools
the
os
but
do
is
gullible
anyway
dos
is
aware
of
doublespace
isnt
it
anyway
good
job
on
dos
and
dos
is
good
for
new
users
just
beware
the
doublespace
rob

rush
limbaugh
think
for
yourself
