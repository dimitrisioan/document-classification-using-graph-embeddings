re
canon
bj
bubblejet
and
hp
deskjet
i
edited
a
few
newsgroup
from
that
line
dont
like
to
crosspost
that
much
i
cant
compare
the
two
but
i
recently
got
an
hp
deskjet
im
very
pleased
with
the
output
remember
that
im
used
to
imagens
laser
and
postscript
printers
at
school
looks
very
good
you
have
to
be
careful
to
let
it
dry
before
touching
it
as
it
will
smudge
the
deskjet
is
slow
this
is
in
comparison
to
the
other
printers
i
mentioned
i
have
no
idea
how
the
bubblejet
compares
the
interface
between
win
and
the
printer
is
just
dandy
ive
not
had
any
problems
with
it
hope
that
helps
