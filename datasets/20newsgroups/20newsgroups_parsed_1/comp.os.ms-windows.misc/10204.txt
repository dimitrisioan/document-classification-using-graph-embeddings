everyone
seems
to
think
that
this
mans
mouse
problem
is
mechanical
its
dirty
i
have
been
having
a
similar
problem
with
my
mouse
and
it
only
occurs
when
ru
nning
windows
and
therefore
can
not
be
mechanical
in
nature
its
my
understanding
that
bus
mice
are
more
accurate
and
stable
in
general
than
serial
mice
if
i
remember
correctly
its
because
of
the
differences
in
how
the
interrupts
are
handled
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
mouse
data
is
received
over
the
computer
bus
as
opposed
to
a
bps
serial
connection
im
running
a
mouse
systems

mouse
on
a

help
is
this
just
a
general
problem
or
is
it
associated
with
a
specific
application
or
group
of
applications
