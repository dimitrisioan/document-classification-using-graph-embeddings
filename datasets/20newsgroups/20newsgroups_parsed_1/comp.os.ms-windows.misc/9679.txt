are
negative

these
i
am
interested
in
the
eisa
version
in
particular
the
card
does
not
work
in
a
system
with
m
ram
the
card
works
in
a
m
system
with
some
switches
set
but
it
is
much
slower
the
card
is
interlaced
in
its
bit
truecolour
modes
the
latest
build
drivers
still
do
not
work
in
many
cases
this
card
is
the
fastest
full
colour
card
for
the
money
this
card
is
the
greatest
thing
since
sliced
bread
