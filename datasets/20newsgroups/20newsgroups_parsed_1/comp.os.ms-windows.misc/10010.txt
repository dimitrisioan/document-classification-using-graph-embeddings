i
really
appreciate
this
information
however
given
that
i
dont
have
direct
internet
access
which
means
i
dont
have
archie
access
i
must
resort
to
using
ftpmail
this
means
that
i
need
the
site
name
and
the
directory
where
these
workspace
managers
are
located
backdeskzip
is
on
cica
but
im
not
sure
of
the
whole
directory
another
to
throw
into
the
running
is
topdesk
it
is
alsow
on
cica
but
im
not
sure
where
it
is
more
complicated
then
backdesk
but
ive
found
it
to
be
more
stable
and
more
usefull
i
recomend
it

people
who
have
already
