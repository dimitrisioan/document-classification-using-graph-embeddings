subject
experiences
with
dos
i
have
been
having
trouble
posting
this
article
from
within
tin
for
over
a
week
if
you
do
get
multiple
copies
my
apologies
here
is
a
challenge
to
microsoft
or
microsort
supporters
to
defend
the
pathetic
state
of
dos
as
an
upgrade
distribution
it
is
a
long
story
but
would
make
good
reading
for
those
who
are
interested
in
knowing
the
potential
pitfalls
of
upgrading
to
dos
that
i
have
been
able
to
notice
after
only
about
a
week
of
playing
around
with
it

after
updgrading
to
dos
i
could
not
understand
why
certain
things
became
so
slow
especially
after
i
decided
to
try
dblspace
in
the
process
of
finding
out
why
i
discovered
some
interesting
things
disk
performance
with
double
space
and
smart
drive
while
most
things
did
not
appear
to
slow
down
most
of
the
time
certain
applications
appeared
to
run
very
much
slower
what
was
interesting
is
that
commands
like
chkdsk
and
defrag
were
running
far
too
slowly
to
consider
them
useful
by
any
standards
i
suspected
double
space
ds
and
decided
to
measure
its
impact
on
my
system
using
winbenchtm
the
real
disk
winmark
of
for
the
original
system
as
shipped
from
factory
with
dos
and
windowws
became
when
upgraded
to
dos
with
ds
thus
there
is
an
effective
performance
degradation
of
more
than
percent
which
did
not
really
surprise
me
because
i
knew
that
ds
compression
must
cost
something
specifically
for
short
sequential
reads
up
to
bytes
ds
actually
improves
transfer
rates
by
about
because
cpu
being
faster
than
io
more
cpu
cycles
needed
for
ds
is
more
than
compensated
by
savings
in
io
cycles
however
for
all
other
cases
particularly
large
random
writes
the
transfers
take
up
to
three
times
as
long
while
the
performance
depends
on
the
type
of
access
ie
random
or
sequential
small
or
large
transfer
units
on
the
average
based
on
winbenchs
assumptions
the
disk
slows
down
to
half
its
speed
the
tests
alone
done
in
real
mode
see
winbench
and
with
smartdrv
on
do
not
say
much
except
that
it
helps
to
put
into
those
subjective
statements
like
there
is
no
noticable
difference
in
performance
or
even
that
it
will
speed
up
disk
access
when
you
have
a
fast
cpu
and
slow
disk
io
this
explained
why
some
applications
ran
markedly
slower
but
not
why
chkdsk
and
defrag
the
latter
especially
too
so
long
double
space
and
windows
dblspace
will
not
run
at
all
from
within
windows
not
even
if
you
wanted
to
only
to
get
information
not
modify
anything
or
for
that
matter
even
check
on
its
usage
try
fasthelp
dblspace
in
a
dos
box
within
windows
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
from
the
error
message
you
get
how
narrow
minded
can
a
programer
get
i
wonder
yes
this
information
can
be
obtained
through
the
mstoolsdd
addon
to
file
manager
but
this
mstools
dll
does
not
understand
a
compressed
floppy
use
the
dos
supplement
utility
to
create
a
compressed
floppy
if
you
dont
know
how
to
dos
defragmenter
is
incompatible
with
ti
apm
defragmentation
seemed
to
take
too
much
time
even
so
i
waited
patiently
till
it
finished
and
then
ran
it
again
to
just
to
confirm
this
confirmation
dblspace
def
command
for
the
m
drive
should
take
no
more
than
seconds
much
faster
on
other
defragmenters
i
have
used
but
it
took
minutes
i
discovered
that
if
i
moved
the
mouse
defragmentation
checking
ran
faster
the
figure
ticked
more
rapidly
it
dawned
on
me
that
this
had
to
do
with
tis
battery
saver
advanced
power
management
apm
module
which
slows
the
clock
down
when
it
thinks
that
the
cpu
is
idle
and
it
obviously
thought
ds
defragmentation
was
an
idle
process
after
disabling
the
tis
power
saver
this
operation
took
only
seconds
microsft
programmers
think
ti
and
gateway
nomad
users
are
idiots
in
the
readmetxt
file
you
can
find
the
the
following
running
microsoft
backup
with
ti
and
gateway
nomad
computers
to
avoid
a
conflict
between
the
turbo
feature
and
microsoft
backup
for
windows
or
msdos
add
a
l
switch
to
the
device
command
in
your
configsys
that
loads
the
batterypro
file
or
before
you
run
microsoft
backup
type
setpower
l
at
the
command
prompt
if
you
checked
tis
manual
on
the
l
option
you
will
realise
that
it
means
disable
all
power
saving
features
of
your
notebook
why
would
anyone
want
to
run
a
driver
disabled
as
i
have
found
out
not
only
does
tis
power
management
interfere
with
microsoft
backup
as
the
readmetxt
claims
but
chkdsk
and
dblspace
and
who
knows
what
else
are
crippled
by
the
tis
power
saver
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
not
such
thing
as
apm
specifications
if
there
indeed
is
such
a
thing
then
either
microsoft
programmers
or
ti
programmers
dont
know
how
to
read
these
specifications
you
dont
have
to
guess
as
to
who
are
the
idiots
by
the
way
if
you
run
the
advance
power
management
utility
powerexe
in
dos
when
you
check
the
status
it
says
power
management
status
setting
adv
max
cpu
idle
of
time
this
figure
of
seems
to
be
the
steady
state
value
on
my
notebook
when
i
am
running
nothing
windows
with
only
program
manager
in
iconised
form
does
that
mean
that
windows
takes
up
of
my
cpu
all
for
itself
and
that
i
have
at
best
only
left
for
useful
work
is
such
an
overhead
justified
whether
or
not
windows
is
an
operating
system
or
just
another
user
interface
in
dos
alone
it
reports
idle
time
looks
like
windows
is
a
good
example
of
busy
waiting
type
of
package
that
i
like
my
students
to
study
as
the
classical
negative
example
of
our
times
microsoft
programmers
do
not
know
batch
programming
i
like
to
structure
my
startup
script
and
thus
have
the
equivalent
of
addpath
statements
like
this
set
pathcdos
set
pathcetcbinpathcbin
set
pathcetcwindowspathcwindows
set
pathpathcbccbin
set
pathpathmouse
even
though
the
new
dos
was
installed
in
the
same
directory
as
the
old
one
ie
cdos
dos
installation
program
modifes
each
and
every
path
statement
and
prepends
cdos
to
its
value
as
a
result
my
resultant
path
has
so
many
doss
if
the
installation
program
wanted
to
remove
the
old
dos
path
and
add
the
new
dos
path
clearly
it
has
to
only
scan
for
the
path
statement
containg
the
old
dos
directory
and
replace
it
by
the
new
dos
path
even
this
should
only
be
done
if
the
new
dos
is
installed
in
a
directory
different
from
the
old
one
being
upgraded
instead
the
microsoft
programmer
if
you
can
call
this
person
one
decided
to
meddle
every
path
statement
i
had
in
the
autoexec
and
prepend
dos
to
the
value
i
wonder
if
microsoft
is
so
desparate
that
it
would
not
fire
programmers
who
are
incapable
of
the
thought
process
i
started
a
thread
on
this
when
dos
came
up
and
the
microsoft
representative
in
singapore
called
me
about
this
poster
in
fact
he
specifically
said
his
us
counterparts
saw
the
poster
and
relayed
the
information
to
him
as
he
did
not
have
access
to
internet
now
that
has
not
changed
one
bit
in
fact
if
you
have
a
path
statement
with
path
already
in
it
is
it
not
obvious
that
the
this
statement
should
not
be
touched
for
any
reason
as
another
example
of
the
inability
of
microsoft
programmers
to
understand
batch
programming
i
had
the
mouse
driver
invoked
as
set
mousecetcmouse
set
pathpathmouse
loadhigh
mousemousecom
guess
what
memmaker
did
it
replaced
the
last
statement
with
lh
cetcmousemousecom
why
is
it
so
difficult
just
to
replace
loadhigh
with
lh
and
its
parameters
without
touching
the
rest
of
the
line
i
do
not
understand
dos
software
quality
dos
is
the
only
operating
system
i
know
in
which
under
normal
usage
you
end
up
creating
a
file
that
you
can
not
get
rid
of
using
of
the
commands
that
come
with
it
i
am
deliberately
being
cryptic
about
this
i
challenge
microsoft
to
use
all
its
programmers
to
catch
this
bug
and
publish
it
if
they
dont
within
a
week
i
will
post
how
you
can
create
this
ghost
file
surely
if
i
can
pick
this
bug
without
even
looking
for
it
after
using
a
particular
command
only
twice
i
am
sure
two
dozen
microsoft
idiot
programmers
randomly
banging
on
their
keyboards
over
a
week
could
find
it
that
is
what
i
was
told
how
microsoft
tests
the
quality
of
their
products
i
think
it
is
funny
that
microsoft
has
found
ways
to
test
quality
when
it
is
accepted
in
the
industry
that
quality
can
not
be
tested
but
can
only
be
built
into
the
product
no
wonder
they
can
not
provide
any
form
of
guarantees
on
their
products
not
even
a
decent
list
of
bugs
that
will
prevent
scores
of
user
from
destroying
their
disks
beyond
repair
also
if
you
run
dblspace
def
often
enough
repeatedly
when
the
disk
is
fully
defragmented
you
may
get
errors
that
was
created
by
the
defragmenters
i
got
my
iosys
file
size
error
and
it
got
truncated
when
i
did
the
chkdsk
this
happend
only
after
five
successive
defragmentation
efforst
after
the
first
one
supposedly
did
its
job
and
with
no
new
file
creation
since
microsft
dont
you
dare
reply
to
this
poster
on
the
network
until
you
admit
that
your
ds
has
bugs
and
are
willing
to
let
us
know
what
we
should
watch
out
for
if
we
