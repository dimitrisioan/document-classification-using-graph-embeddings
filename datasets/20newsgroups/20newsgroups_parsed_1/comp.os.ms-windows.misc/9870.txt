re
canon
bj
bubblejet
and
hp
deskjet
wrote
the
key
issue
that
i
bought
my
bj
on
was
ink
drying
speed
you
really
have
to
try
awful
hard
to
get
the
bj
ink
to
smear
the
hp
deskjets
need
seconds
to
completely
dry
in
both
cases
however
do
not
get
your
pages
wet
unlike
laser
printers
the
material
on
your
pages
is
ink
not
toner
but
that
should
go
without
saying
i
think
the
ink
now
used
in
the
deskjet
family
is
waterfast
