i
have
heard
many
things
about
the
ati
ultra
pro
card
some
have
been
positive
but
most
are
negative
could
people
please
confirm
these
i
am
interested
in
the
eisa
version
in
particular
the
card
does
not
work
in
a
system
with
m
ram
the
higher
memory
limits
apply
to
isa
cards
only
as
far
as
i
know
the
vlb
and
eisa
version
should
have
no
problems
the
card
works
in
a
m
system
with
some
switches
set
but
it
is
much
slower
again
the
memory
aperture
need
only
be
disabled
if
you
have
more
than
m
ram
eisa
and
vlb
or
m
isa
m
should
not
be
a
problem
for
you
the
card
is
interlaced
in
its
bit
truecolour
modes
nope
i
can
use
x
at
hz
bit
and
x
at
hz
bit
all
noninterlaced
the
latest
build
drivers
still
do
not
work
in
many
cases
they
arent
perfect
but
are
much
improved
i
dont
recall
the
last
time
which
i
had
to
leave
mach
mode
ati
gup
mode
and
switch
to
or
vga
mode
due
to
software
incompatibility
this
card
is
the
fastest
full
colour
card
for
the
money
its
quite
fast
but
whether
or
not
its
the
fastest
is
open
to
debate
this
card
is
the
greatest
thing
since
sliced
bread
i
like
it
