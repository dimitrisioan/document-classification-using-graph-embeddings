is
supposed
to
read
and
write
mac
disks
ive
never
tried
it
though
good
luck
i
just
tried
it
but
i
cant
say
that
it
works
cause
it
doesnt
read
k
disks
it
only
reads
mb
if
there
a
program
that
does
read
k
disks
please
let
me
know
im
not
sure
that
this
is
possible
due
to
the
way
the
mac
writes
the
k
disk
i
think
the
way
the
sectors
are
set
up
are
different
enough
that
a
pc
cant
read
it
this
is
a
hardware
problem
which
software
can
not
correct
hope
this
helps
and
correct
me
if
im
wrong
