a
while
ago
i
installed
spss
for
windows
as
part
of
an
evaluation
once
the
evaluation
was
complete
i
duly
deleted
the
software
from
my
pc
unfortunately
there
is
still
a
ghost
of
spss
left
when
i
run
something
like
write
and
go
to
embed
an
object
then
spss
chart
appears
on
the
list
of
objects
im
offered
i
looked
around
all
the
obvious
ini
files
without
success
the
next
thing
i
tried
was
looking
for
the
string
spss
chart
in
every
file
in
the
windows
directory
it
turned
up
in
a
file
called
reqdat
or
regdat
unfortunately
the
file
was
binary
and
so
i
didnt
feel
inclined
to
edit
it
id
welcome
a
solution
for
removing
spss
from
the
list
of
ole
servers
chris
wooff
you
can
edit
that
file
with
a
utility
that
comes
with
windows
called
regedit
registration
