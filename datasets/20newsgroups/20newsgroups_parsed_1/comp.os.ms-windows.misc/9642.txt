error

hi
while
running
the
ms
quick
c
compiler
in
a
dos
window
under
windows
this
evening
i
got
a
program
has
violated
system
integrity
close
all
applications
exit
windows
and
restart
your
computer
error
i
started
to
do
this
when
i
immediately
got
a
serious
disk
error
message
from
windows
hit
return
to
retry
i
did
that
about
times
and
then
rebooted
to
find
that
quite
a
few
files
have
been
corrupted
somehow
i
am
including
the
chkdsk
output
below
questions
is
there
an
easy
way
to
restore
everything
to
working
order
what
might
be
some
better
approaches
what
might
have
caused
this
does
the
smartdrv
cache
make
me
more
vulnerable
im
suspicious
of
hard
drive
caches
especially
when
they
cache
data
writing
the
straightforward
approach
would
be
to
run
chkdsk
with
the
f
option
to
fix
the
disk
and
then
it
looks
like
i
would
probably
have
to
reinstall
windows
and
a
few
other
things
thanks
for
your
comments
and
suggestions
