i
installed
the
sw
for
my
ati
graphics
card
and
it
bashed
my
windows
logo
files
when
i
start
windows
now
it
has
the
logo
instead
of
the
logo
i
thought
the
files
that
controlled
this
were
windowssystemvgalogorle
windowssystemvgalogolgo
i
restored
these
files
but
it
didnt
change
the
logo
anyone
know
what
the
correct
files
are
for
a
vga
card
these
are
the
correct
files
but
you
cant
just
copy
them
back
and
expect
it
to
work
you
have
to
create
a
new
wincom
file
try
the
command
you
will
have
to
worry
about
what
directories
each
file
is
in
since
i
dont
know
your
setup
copy
b
wincnfvgalogolgovgalogorle
wincom
i
grabbed
this
from
supercharging
windows
by
judd
robbinsgreat
book
this
is
also
how
you
can
put
your
own
logo
into
the
windows
startup
screen
an
rle
file
is
just
a
specially
compressed
bmp
file
hope
this
helps
