hey
now
first
of
all
sorry
to
post
this
dos
question
in
a
windows
group
but
im
in
kinda
a
hurry
so
i
cant
scramble
to
find
the
dos
groups
names
anyway
anyone
know
where
i
ccan
find
the
exit
codes
to
dos
commands
there
are
alternatives
you
can
try
to
write
a
small
c
program
something
like
int
myintvar
myintvar
systemcommand
and
display
myintvar
value
which
is
the
exit
code
of
the
command
or
use
doscom
instead
of
commandcom
it
has
built
in
move
command
you
can
also
get
any
program
exist
code
by
using
the
exec
function
of
dos
cecho
will
display
the
exit
code
of
the
command
get
dos
not
worth
buying
if
you
already
have
qemmpctoolsnorton
and
you
only
need
the
move
utility
the
manual
doesnt
seem
to
have
all
of
them
im
particularly
looking
for
copy
in
order
to
make
a
move
batch
file
such
that
if
the
file
wasnt
coppied
properly
it
wont
be
deleted
please
email
thanks
