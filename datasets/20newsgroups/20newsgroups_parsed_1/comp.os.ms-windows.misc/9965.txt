re
ami
pro
and
pctools
compress
doesnt
like
being
moved
sorry
about
that
dont
want
to
alarm
anyone
i
dont
think
there
is
any
correlation
between
the
crashes
and
pctools
i
reinstalled
ami
pro
and
ran
compress
again
with
no
problems
i
think
problems
may
have
been
related
to
filling
my
disk
until
it
had
bytes
left
while
ftping
although
i
would
think
it
wouldnt
matter
since
ami
pro
wasnt
running
at
the
time
and
i
made
space
available
immediately
anyways
but
whatever
the
cause
it
is
working
now
derek
