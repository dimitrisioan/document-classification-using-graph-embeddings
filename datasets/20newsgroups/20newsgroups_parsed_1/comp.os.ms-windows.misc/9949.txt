i
have
a
modest
system
of
aliasesmacros
that
enables
me
to
download
mail
from
a
public
access
unix
system
to
my
msdos
box
i
read
and
reply
to
the
mail
with
a
ms
windows
based
editor
everything
works
peachey
keen
as
long
as
the
author
of
the
message
has
maintained
his
text
at
col
max
width
sometimes
i
get
slightly
wider
messages
that
run
offscreen
so
i
have
to
use
the
cursorslider
to
read
the
whole
thing
im
using
ndw
deskedit
mainly
but
ive
experienced
the
same
prob
with
all
other
ms
windows
editors
ive
fiddled
with
word
wrap
settings
in
the
various
editors
but
to
no
avail
i
know
im
missing
something
very
basic
in
editor
setup
but
what
is
it
oh
yeah
ms
word
for
windows
converts
everything
flawlessly
but
for
what
im
looking
for
thats
like
using
a
tank
to
crack
walnuts
id
really
like
to
have
an
editor
setup
that
would
display
all
incoming
ascii
files
in
a
readable
format
to
my
screen
thanks
in
advance
