one
of
our
users
is
having
an
unusual
problem
if
she
does
an
alttab
to
a
fullscreen
dos
program
when
she
goes
back
to
windows
her
desktop
fonts
have
changed
if
she
goes
back
to
a
fullscreen
dos
program
and
then
goes
back
to
windows
the
font
has
changed
back
to
its
default
font
its
not
a
major
problem
everything
works
and
the
font
is
legible
but
it
is
annoying
does
anyone
have
any
idea
why
this
happens
by
the
way
she
has
a
dec
dlp
machine
if
its
any
consolation
i
had
a
similar
problem
as
i
recall
if
i
exited
from
a
dos
session
while
in
fullscreen
mode
the
menu
titles
had
changed
to
a
scrambled
version
of
the
icon
title
font
or
something
like
that
it
only
started
happening
after
i
used
icontitlefacename
in
winini
to
change
the
desktop
font
to
arial
so
i
stopped
exiting
from
dos
sessions
while
in
fullscreen
mode
my
mac
used
to
do
something
similar
