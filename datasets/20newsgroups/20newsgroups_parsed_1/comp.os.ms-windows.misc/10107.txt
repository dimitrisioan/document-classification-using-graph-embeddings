where
to
put
my
swap
file
ide
or
scsi
i
have
a
sx
and
i
recently
added
a
scsi
drive
to
my
system
using
an
adaptec
non
busmastering
controller
yesterday
i
ran
coretest
to
find
out
drive
performance
and
these
are
the
values
i
got
seagate
meg
kbsec
ms
avg
seek
ms
track
to
track
quantum
meg
scsi
kbsec
avg
seek
track
to
track
first
off
all
are
these
good
results
i
dont
know
what
typical
values
are
what
im
wondering
now
is
the
following
my
swap
file
is
currently
on
the
ide
i
could
move
it
to
the
scsi
which
is
faster
but
then
i
would
not
be
able
to
use
bit
access
which
might
actuall
make
it
slower
so
on
which
drive
should
i
put
my
swap
file
to
get
best
results
is
there
a
swap
file
speed
test
program
out
there
finally
i
also
ran
the
above
tests
with
the
aspidos
driver
loaded
and
i
got
no
difference
whatsoever
in
performance
is
there
any
reason
at
all
why
i
should
load
this
driver
thanks
in
advance
i
will
post
a
summary
if
i
get
enough
responses
