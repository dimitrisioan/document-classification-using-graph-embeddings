fahrenheit
problems
help
hi
i
recently
bought
an
orchid
fahrenheit
its
a
real
nice
card
but
im
having
very
big
problems
with
it
the
basic
problem
is
that
vertical
lines
are
missing
from
the
display
in
windows
something
like
every
other
line
or
so
also
when
i
use
a
dos
gif
viewer
namely
vpic
c
in
fahrenheit
mode
vertical
lines
are
swapped
its
very
strange
looking
if
it
uses
vesa
standards
however
it
works
great
only
it
thinks
theres
only
k
on
the
card
theres
mb
on
there
i
have
contacted
orchid
support
and
they
tried
to
be
helpful
but
didnt
have
the
answer
i
dont
think
the
card
is
the
problem
since

works
great
on
my
friends
