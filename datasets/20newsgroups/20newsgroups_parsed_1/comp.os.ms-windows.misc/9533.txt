tell
him
he
probably
needs
to
upgrade
to
a
faster
video
card
my
baud

was
one
of
the
reasons
i
sought
out
the

i
get
about
million
winmarks
on
my
and
it
just
about
keeps
up
with
the
modem
speed
using
procomm
plus
for
windows
too
he
should
get
over
million
on
his
machine
with
the
same
card
anything
should
yield
acceptable
speed
im
using
pc

at
home
