re
visual
c
it
is
correct
that
vc
is
not
considered
an
upgrade
for
c
c
is
basically
a
dos
product
vc
is
a
windows
product
as
windows
is
not
an
upgrade
for
dos
it
is
a
separate
operating
system
product
line
its
utilities
can
not
be
upgrades
for
dos
utilities
however
i
have
also
been
told
that
it
is
not
an
upgrade
for
qcwin
which
it
should
be
in

my
understanding
is
that
visual
c
is
msc
is
it
not
what
i
mean
is
it
is
intended
as
a
logical
upgrade
to
msc
which
i
own
i
am
very
interested
in
vc
but
i
cant
find
anything
about
it
tell
me
more
hows
the
editor
is
it
a
true
windows
app
msc
which
i
love
is
not
how
are
compile
times
exe
sizes
how
smart
is
the
linker
how
well
does
it
do
dos
apps
i
would
like
to
be
one
of
the
few
programmers
still
pumping
out
stuff
for
the
dos
users
out
there
even
though
i
run
win
i
like
the
multitasking
and
i
couldnt
afford
desqview
will
it
link
rd
party
libs
easily
i
use
lots
of
rd
party
libs
in
my
dos
programs
too
lazy
to
do
my
own
interfaces
how
is
the
debugger
i
make
lots
of
mistakes
