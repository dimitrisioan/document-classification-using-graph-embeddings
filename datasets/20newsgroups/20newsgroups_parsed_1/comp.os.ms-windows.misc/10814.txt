hello
i
am
in
need
of
a
file
viewer
for
bit
tiff
images
to
run
under
windows
if
it
matters
alternatively
a
package
to
run
an
xserver
on
top
of
windows
would
do
very
well
unfortunately
the
budget
for
this
is
limited
so
whatever
i
end
up
using
has
to
be
public
domain
or
very
inexpensive
thanks
in
advance
for
any
help
john
paintshop
pro
for
windows
is
a
fantastic
product
it
can
handle
tiff
gif
bmp
pcx
and
many
other
formats
displaying
them
and
converting
between
them
there
is
a
shareware
version
of
the
program
i
assume
its
available
in
the
windows
areas
of
the
standard
anonymous
ftp
locations
id
try
ftpcicaindianaedu
log
in
as
ftp
use
your
username
as
a
password
and
look
for
a
program
called
pspexe
or
something
like
that
i
have
the
registered
version
and
the
only
major
difference
i
can
detect
is
that
the
unregistered
version
pops
up
a
message
when
you
start
the
program
asking
you
to
please
register
it
once
again
fantastic
software
up
to
bits
huge
images
