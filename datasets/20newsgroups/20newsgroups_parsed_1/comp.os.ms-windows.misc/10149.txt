help
with
changing
startup
logo
there
has
been
a
long
running
discussion
over
changing
the
startup
logo
for

while
all
the
copy
methods
are
great
havent
seen
any
mention
of
a
program
that
will
do
it
for
you
well
i
found
one
on
cica
called
winlogo
cant
remember
where
unfortuantely
and
it
seems
to
work
real
well
even
comes
with
a
couple
example
rle
files
what
id
really
like
though
is
a
way
to
create
rle
files
myself
specifically
the
rle
format
mentioned
in
the
winlogo
readme
file
can
anyone
point
me
in
the
direction
of
such
a
beast
with
a
real
directory
path
all
the
ones
ive
seen
mentioned
