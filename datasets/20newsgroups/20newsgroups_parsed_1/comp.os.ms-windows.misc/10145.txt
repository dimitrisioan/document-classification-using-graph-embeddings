lets
see
what
ms
products
dont
have
major
bugs
in
them
oh
but
the
fifth
release
the
bugs
are
generally
cleared
up
even
if
their
generally
the
second
or
third
major
release
usually
takes
care
of
it
my
advice
based
on
plenty
of
personal
experience
is
to
never
buy
the
first
version
of
anything
from
microsoft
this
includes
major
version
number
upgrades
from
previous
releases
such
as
microsoft
c
always
wait
at
least
for
the
a
upgrade
or
slipstream
upgrade
if
youre
going
to
buy
it
san
francisco
is
like
granola
take
away
the
fruits
and
the
nuts
and
all
you
have
left
are
the
flakes
