windows
has
starting
giving
me
the
error
sound
blaster
pro
requires
newer
version
of
windows
it
has
worked
correctly
for
a
long
time
and
dont
know
what
the
problem
could
be
thanks
i
had
this
problem
when
i
initially
installed
my
sound
blaster
pro
and
heres
what
the
tech
support
told
me
they
told
me
to
look
for
the
files
that
are
stated
in
the
readme
file
from
the
win
subdirectory
of
the
soudblaster
directory
now
look
in
the
systemini
file
and
if
any
of
them
say
devicexxxxxxx
than
change
it
to
devicexxxxxxx
thats
should
work
was
your
systemini
file
erased
for
some
reason
that
would
be
the
only
reason
that
i
would
think
that
windoes
is
giving
you
the
error
now
