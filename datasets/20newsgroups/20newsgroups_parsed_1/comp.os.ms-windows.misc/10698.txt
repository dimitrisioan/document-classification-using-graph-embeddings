do
not
load
smartdrvsys
if
you
are
using
stacker
this
applies
for
windows
i
replied
why
do
you
mean
just
use
smartdrvexe
in
autoexecbat
roger
you
answered
quoting
from
windowssetuptxt
under
the
section
for
using
stacker
for
best
performance
do
not
use
smartdrive
to
cache
the
compressed
drive
you
only
need
to
cache
the
uncompressed
drive
check
it
out
for
yourself
i
think
it
is
important
to
clear
up
your
first
reply
you
gave
the
impression
that
you
should
not
use
smartdrive
with
stacker
you
are
correct
re
caching
the
compressed
drive
however
as
i
understand
it
you
can
cache
the
uncompressed
drive
thus
if
you
have
compressed
your
disk
c
you
will
have
a
c
and
probably
a
d
drive
under
stacker
c
being
the
compressed
disk
which
is
just
a
large
file
on
d
and
d
being
the
uncompressed
disk
you
should
only
attempt
to
stack
d
in
fact
with
win
and
smartdrvexe
it
seems
smart
enough
to
automatically
default
to
stacking
your
ab
and
d
drives
