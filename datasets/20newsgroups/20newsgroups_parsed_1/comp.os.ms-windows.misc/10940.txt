the
next
question
is
even
if
i
did
want
to
run
os
and
i
had
this
big
monster
machine
to
run
it
on
is
there
a
diverse
i
think
youre
deliberatly
overstating
the
requirements
for
os
considering
that
os
is
a
multithreaded
true
multitasking
os
and
takes
the
place
of
dos
and
windows
and
more
i
actually
think
the
requirements
for
os
are
very
reasoable
i
also
think
that
anyone
using
windows
without
megs
of
ram
a
and
megs
of
hard
drive
space
is
beating
their
head
against
a
wall
those
are
also
legitimate
requirements
for
os
in
fact
the
requirements
for
windows
and
os
are
about
equal
exquise
me
since
when
does
mankind
consider
twice
to
be
equal
the
natural
progress
of
things
is
for
government
to
gain
ground
and
for
liberty
to
yield
