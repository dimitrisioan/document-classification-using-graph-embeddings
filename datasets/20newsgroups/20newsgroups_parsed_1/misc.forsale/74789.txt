tom

says
recently
i
bought
a
musical
instrument
through
the
internet
and
had
it
shipped
to
me
via
ups
ground
the
shipping
was
done
through
a
mail
box
service
mailboxes
etc
being
somewhat
surprised
at
the
price
i
compared
prices
of
shipping
this
way
to
shipping
directly
through
ups
and
this
is
a
summary
i
am
not
making
any
endorsements
or
condemnations
but
merely
presenting
the
facts
from
which
you
may
draw
your
own
conclusions
ive
encountered
the
same
thing
with
mailboxes
etc
and
i
suggest
anyone
to
use
the
original
ups
service
if
at
all
possible
shipping
to
virginia
from
cleveland
was
around
for
pounds
and
cod
was
as
opposed
to
for
ups
ill
third
the
opinion
about
this
outfitfranchise
now
when
i
buy
over
the
net
and
pick
up
the
shipping
costs
ill
specify
that
i
only
pick
up
the
normal
ups
charges
as
if
delivered
directly
to
ups
as
ive
been
burned
by
shipping
charges
for
a
pkg
i
will
never
use
a
mailing
service
unless
i
dont
have
the
right
box
and
the
buyer
needs
whatever
immediately
ill
also
tell
the
person
if
they
agreed
to
pick
up
shipping
what
is
going
on
other
things
to
watch
out
forconsider
the
rates
are
to
higher
than
ups
direct
for
a
nonups
truck
package
they
quoted
a
rate
of
fed
ex
economy
air
was
only
for
the
same
weight
rps
a
trucking
package
company
in
many
cities
only
wanted
guess
who
got
it
the
mailbox
operator
told
me
i
was
not
telling
the
truth
about
competitors
rates
said
rps
was
unreliable
ive
used
them
before
with
no
problems
etc
right
a
cod
check
goes
to
the
mailing
service
our
local
mailbox
then
takes
its
sweet
time
mailing
me
the
remade
check
all
this
for
an
additional
over
the
ups
cod
charge
what
a
deal
for
packages
over
they
charge
you
about
double
over
what
ups
charges
them
for
insurance
ive
never
had
a
claim
but
other
netters
is
ralph
seguin
out
there
have
told
horror
stories
about
them
all
package
traces
have
to
be
done
through
mailbox
by
mailbox
our
local
mailbox
operator
told
me
i
was
lying
when
i
asked
him
why
their
rates
were
stratospheric
compared
to
direct
ups
does
he
ever
check
probably
not
their
ups
ground
rates
come
close
to
fed
exs
economy
air
rate
and
fed
ex
will
pick
up
ups
will
pick
up
for
a
charge
in
most
areas
