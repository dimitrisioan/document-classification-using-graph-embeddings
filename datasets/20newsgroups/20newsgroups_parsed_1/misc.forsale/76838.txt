i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
there
are
a
few
honest
and
good
people
out
there
even
outside
of
iowa
im
sorry
if
anyone
thinks
that
i
am
wasting
space
but
i
thought
you
might
want
some
relief
from
the
soandso
is
a
thief
posts
not
that
i
think
we
shouldnt
hear
about
the
bad
deals
but
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
some
good
news
once
in
a
while
this
was
nice
of
kevin
to
post
this
but
just
so
no
one
is
misled
the
vast
majority
of
usenetters
are
honest
and
good
people
in
fact
in
the
latest
study
of
all
netdeals
went
off
smoothly
without
a
hitch
its
just
that
the
few
bad
ones
are
what
get
all
the
publicity
agreed
i
have
yet
to
run
into
a
problem
in
deals
over
the
net
and
i
have
bought
things
from
cds
plenty
to
a
full
computer
the
only
small
problem
that
i
have
had
was
with
ups
rather
than
the
seller
besides
complaints
are
always
what
get
the
publicitywhen
something
goes
wrong
people
complain
rarely
have
i
seen
posts
stating
how
well
a
deal
went
through
i
guess
kevin
is
practically
a
first
id
rather
be
swimming
