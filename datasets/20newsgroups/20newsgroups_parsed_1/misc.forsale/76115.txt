does
anyone
know

i
would

useful
info
about
the
maxtor
drive
deleted
since
the
b
normally
has
only
one
hd
you
would
jumper
bet
c
to
select
the
first
possible
drive
address
if
the
is
your
second
drive
on
the
b
then
jumper
between
c
however
thad
you
should
note
that
he
said
that
he
would
like
to
use
it
on
a
pc
not
unixpc
also
note
the
strange
crossposting
as
he
probably
did
not
so
it
is
not
sure
exactly
what
sort
of
machine
he
intends
to
mount
it
on
if
it
is
a
pc
or
clone
then
the
c
jumper
would
be
the
correct
choice
ive
left
the
crossposting
in
effect
since
im
not
sure
which
newsgroup
he
would
really
be
