i
just
love
these
posts
from
the
exsoviet
union
among
the
cars
dinette
sets
video
cameras
etc
every
now
and
then
an
ad
pops
up
for
bee
venom
red
oxide
of
mercury
cobalt
tons
minimum
order
etc
dont
they
have
garage
sales
in
russia
it
really
doesnt
strike
me
as
very
funny
it
is
rather
indicative
of
what
a
crisis
their
economy
is
in
i
imagine
they
are
in
desparate
need
of
markets
to
sustain
industries
and
people
which
are
nolonger
under
central
control
of
the
government

done
and

the
pig
