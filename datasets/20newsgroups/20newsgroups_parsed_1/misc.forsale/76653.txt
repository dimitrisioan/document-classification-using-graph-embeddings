this
posting
reminded
me
about
a
longstanding
question
ive
had
does
it
pay
to
consider
an
underwater
camera
for
pictures
taken
on
land
but
in
harsh
environments
eg
rain
snow
heat
cold
mud
dust
or
are
the
lenses
etc
all
tuned
for
the
refractive
index
of
water
i
have
had
a
nikon
law
since
unfortunately
it
is
no
longer
made
it
is
a
p
s
sealed
to
resist
water
to
a
depth
of
feet
it
is
not
really
an
underwater
camera
but
it
has
been
great
in
wet
and
dusty
conditions
it
takes
aa
batteries
hooray
it
has
the
solid
heavy
feel
of
oldstyle
nikons
and
has
taken
all
the
abuse
i
have
been
able
to
give
it
this
includes
a
lot
of
water
rain
river
and
sea
desert
and
beach
sand
as
well
as
being
used
as
a
weapon
against
a
mugger
shouting
and
swinging
the
camera
by
the
strap
didnt
scare
the
mugger
away
hitting
him
with
the
flying
camera
did
this
is
my
never
be
without
a
camera
camera
the
current
waterresistant
sport
touch
i
think
is
the
name
model
is
nothing
like
as
solid
or
well
sealed
