ensoniq
sq
crosswave
synthesizer
i
have
an
sq
for
sale
the
sq
is
a
powerful
performance
oriented
synth
with
a
limited
onboard
sequencer
i
bought
it
because
it
has
a
very
large
timbral
repertoire
it
seems
to
do
meaty
analog
synth
sounds
as
well
as
sounds
that
are
considerably
more
digital
below
are
a
list
of
features
extracted
from
the
owners
manual
o
eightvoice
polyphonic
polytimbral

playing
eight
different
sounds
at

with
dynamic

for
each
voice
o

combine
different
attack
and

sounds
o

as
the

source
o

o
a
fullfeatured

capable
of
sending
eight
midi

volume
changes
at

and
polyphonic

o
powerful
matrix
modulation
scheme
allows
a
very
wide
range
of
modulation
sources
and
routings
o
a
floppy
disk
drive
which
writesreads
ordinary

disks
allows
fast
and
reliable
storage
of
up
to
sequences
and
up
to
sound
patches
on
a
single
floppy
disk
also
has
a
ramcart
slot
for
patches
that
is
compatible
with
esq
ramcarts
o
does
sysex

to
its
floppy
disk
for
any
sysex
capable
midi
device
o
character
fluorescent

and
userfriendly
pagedriven
programming
scheme
provides
a
fairly
humane
user
interface
o
stereo
lineouts
and
stereo
headphone
jack
for
private
listening
o
sound
programs
and
sequences
are
upwardly
compatible
with
the
esq
so
that
sounds
and
sequences
created
for
the
esq
can
be
played
on
the
sq
this
sq
has
been
the
main
midi
controller
in
my
studio
for
quite
a
while
now
it
has
performed
ably
in
that
role
and
has
also
been
a
heavily
used
sound
source
at
the
same
time
the
sq
seems
to
have
been
designed
with
this
role
in
mind
and
it
works
very
well
with
my
software
sequencer
wincake
in
its
multitimbral
mode
from
a
synthesis
point
of
view
this
machine
is
a
hybrid
it
uses
looped
short
samples
there
are
of
them
as
sources
then
these
waves
are
processed
with
a
sophisticated
dcfdca
arrangement
the
sq
is
capable
of
great
things
because
of
its
pole
analog
lowpass
filter
simply
put
it
makes
fabulous
analog
synth
sounds
but
unlike
most
good
analog
synths
it
has
a
very
thorough
midi
implementation
so
that
it
works
very
well
with
a
midi
sequencer
what
i
really
like
most
about
this
thing
is
that
it
is
capable
of
making
a
very
wide
range
of
sounds
this
sq
is
about
years
old
mfg
date
it
does
have
an
track
sequencer
but
like
most
onboard
sequencers
it
is
a
pain
to
use
so
i
have
avoided
it
reason
for
sale
i
am
selling
my
sq
because
i
recently
joined
forces
with
another
individual
here
in
boston
and
we
have
more
keyboards
than
space
to
put
them
i
recommend
it
for
someone
who
is
getting
started
in
sequencing
and
needs
a
powerful
but
economical
master
keyboard
pricing
and
terms
i
paid
for
this
synth
a
few
years
ago
i
am
willing
to
accept
average
rmms
asking
price
is
i
will
include
a
bunch
of
patches
on
sq
floppy
disks
for
the

of
