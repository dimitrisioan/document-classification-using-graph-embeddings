reminding
us
that
advertising
is
not
done
on
internet
as
a
matter
of
fact
dj
it
does
make
a
difference
almost
a
half
million
new
users
joined
the
internet
last
year
many
of
them
are
commercial
businesses
the
ban
on
commercial
use
of
internet
is
no
more
jack
there
is
a
difference
between
using
the
network
for
commercial
purposes
and
advertising
in
newsgroups
business
communication
is
okay
advertising
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
users
around
the
planet
who
have
no
desire
to
receive
advertising
is
not
okay
those
of
us
who
pay
for
internet
access
are
constrained
only
by
our
innate
good
taste
and
no
have
no
administrator
to
guide
us
i
suspect
that
a
site
which
generated
a
large
volume
of
material
not
in
anybodys
good
taste
would
find
itself
getting
a
lot
of
attention
it
didnt
want
you
may
belong
to
the
public
library
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
can
deface
the
books
disorder
the
stacks
or
disturb
the
other
patrons
youre
constrained
by
the
same
rules
that
the
rest
of
the
users
many
academic
and
military
who
get
irritable
about
a
network
for
which
they
pay
with
tax
and
grant
money
carrying
private
business
advertising
follow
there
are
secret
masters
here
just
like
everywhere
else
theyre
not
as
obvious
as
the
ones
on
prodigy
but
theyre
here
no
doubt
at
some
point
the
internet
like
everything
else
will
become
grotty
enough
to
carry
advertising
at
that
time
i
hope
it
is
confined
to
its
own
newsgroups
and
not
on
discussion
