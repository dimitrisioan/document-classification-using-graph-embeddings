it
is
my
impression
that
net
etiquette
does
not
allow
companies
to
use
the
net
to
directly
advertise
their
products
in
addition
to
improper
etiquette
this
product
is
a
mailing
list
used
for
generating
junk
mail
am
i
correct
in
assuming
this
is
improper
and
if
so
what
can
be
done
to
penalize
such
an
improper
use
