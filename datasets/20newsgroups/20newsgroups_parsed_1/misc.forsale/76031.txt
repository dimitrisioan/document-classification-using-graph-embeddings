tcdd
dat
walkman
for
sale
i
recently
backed
out
of
purchasing
an
almostunused
sony
tcdd
dat
walkman
having
found
someone
else
who
has
a
unit
i
personally
prefer
and
am
paying
more
for
however
its
still
a
heck
of
a
machine
for
the
price
it
is
quite
rugged
and
many
people
out
there
swear
by
it
its
probably
the
most
popular
walkmanstyle
dat
machine
out
there
anyway
the
guy
selling
it
is
bryan
davis
and
heres
what
he
told
me
here
is
what
is
included
tcdd
datman
rca
to
stereo
plug
cables
one
for
analog
input
one
for
analog
output
optical
digital
io
cable
one
lead
for
input
one
for
output
a
copy
of
my
sales
receipt
with
a
note
about
your
purchase
the
unit
is
still
under
factory
warrantee
ac
adaptorbattery
charger
rechargable
battery
i
paid
tax
for
it
so
i
hope
you
dont
mind
if
i
keep
the
minute
tape
it
came
with
i
have
some
samples
on
it
by
the
way
he
spent
at
least
too
much
for
it
unless
hes
including
an
extended
warranty
which
is
advised
for
dat
machines
since
it
costs
about
to
replace
the
head
when
it
wears
out
and
it
probably
will
within
years
if
you
use
it
a
lot
davisonj
im
not
going
to
quote
my
sale
price
for
him
that
would
not
be
nice
send
him
mail
and
ask
him
what
he
wants
again
ive
used
the
tcdd
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
can
certainly
understand
why
it
is
as
popular
as
it
is
ive
been
using
one
for
a
little
while
and
although
i
had
some
problems
with
it
recently
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
particular
one
i
was
using
had
been
on
the
road
for
two
years
and
had
truly
been
used
during
that
time
this
is
the
same
exact
dat
machine
that
was
lugged
around
the
us
and
canada
to
record
the
jazz
butcher
conspiracy
for
their
recent
live
album
bryan
davis
says
i
know
at
least
half
a
dozen
professional
musicians
and
record
labels
in
sf
who
use
that
model
and
have
been
for
a
while
with
no
reported
problem
my
problem
is
that
everyone
i
know
already
has
one
nuff
said
the
reason
im
not
getting
it
is
that
i
found
someone
else
selling
me
a
unit
that
features
phonoplug
spdif
io
instead
of
optical
i
dont
have
any
optical
ports
on
my
equipment
but
you
the
reader
might
and
it
also
has
some
other
bells
whistles
that
the
tcdd
doesnt
i
am
also
paying
more
for
the
alternative
note
that
phonoplugtooptical
spdif
adapters
are
available
if
you
absolutely
must
have
one
of
course
it
has
scms
all
consumer
decks
do
so
do
sony
minidiscs
by
the
way
anyway
if
youre
interested
get
in
touch
with
john
davison
