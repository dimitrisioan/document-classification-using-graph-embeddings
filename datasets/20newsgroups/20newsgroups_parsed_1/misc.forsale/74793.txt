so
does
anyone
care
to
enlighten
us
whether
dos
is
worth
upgrading
to
how
good
is
its
compression
and
can
it
be
turned
onoff
at
will
any
other
nicenasty
features
according
to
reports
if
you
dont
have
dos
yet
and
dont
have
any
utilities
qemm
stacker
pctools
norton
then
dos
may
be
worth
it
for
people
who
have
dos
and
some
sort
of
utility
dos
doesnt
offer
much
youd
never
know
it
from
the
usual
hype
that
marketing
is
able
to
create
however
imho
it
seems
to
be
worth
the
to
upgrade
doublespace
seems
a
bit
saner
than
stacker
which
ive
replaced
memmaker
is
nowhere
near
as
aggressive
as
qemm
but
it
doesnt
hose
my
system
like
qemm
did
at
least
it
hasnt
yet
microsoft
antivirus
is
just
the
latest
version
or
a
reasonably
recent
one
of
cpav
mine
was
very
aged
so
this
was
quite
welcome
msdos
aint
the
end
all
be
all
of
operating
systems
but
its
better
than
a
sharp
stick
in
the
eye
unless
you
happen
to
be
into
that
sort
of
thing

there
is
freedom
of
choice
for
every
choice
but
mine
