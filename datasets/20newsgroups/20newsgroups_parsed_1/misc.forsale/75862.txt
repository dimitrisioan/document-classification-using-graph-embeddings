the
catalog
of
personal
computing
tools
for
engineers
and
scien
tists
lists
hardware
cards
and
application
software
packages
for
pcxtatps
class
machines
focus
is
on
engineering
and
scien
tific
applications
of
pcs
such
as
data
acquisitioncontrol
design
automation
and
data
analysis
and
presentation
if
you
would
like
a
free
copy
reply
with
your
u
s
postal
mailing
address
dont
bother
it
never
comes
its
a
cheap
trick
for
building
a
mailing
list
to
sell
if
my
junk
mail
flow
is
any
indication
andy
sent
his
address
months
ago
perhaps
we
can
get
portal
to
nuke
this
weasal
i
never
received
a
catalog
either
if
that
person
doesnt
respond
to
a
growing
flame
then
we
can
assume
that
weyall
look
forward
to
lotsa
junk
mail
i
dont
want
him
nuked
i
want
him
to
be
honest
the
junk
mail
has
been
much
more
interesting
than
the
promised
catalog
if
id
known
what
i
was
going
to
get
i
wouldnt
have
hesitated
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
there
were
other
folks
who
looked
at
the
ad
and
said
nope
but
who
would
be
very
interested
in
the
junk
mail
that
results
similarly
there
are
people
who
wanted
the
advertised
catalog
who
arent
happy
with
the
junk
they
got
instead
the
folks
buying
the
mailing
lists
would
prefer
an
honest
ad
and
so
would
the
people
reading
it
