stuff
deleted
for
example
i
subscribe
to
magazines
abc
news
and
xyz
products
i
give
my
name
as
joseph
x
cool
for
the
first
and
joe
q
cool
for
the
nd
when
i
get
junk
mail
addressed
to
joseph
x
cool
i
know
where
they
bought
my
name
this
doesnt
help
not
getting
junk
mail
but
you
at
least
know
whos
selling
your
name
and
if
you
ask
companies
to
not
sell
your
name
to
mailing
liststelemarketeers
they
are
not
supposed
to
as
in
its
illegal
and
in
case
you
havent
guessed
i
dont
really
use
joe
cool
my
company
maintains
a
mailing
list
which
is
regularly
rented
for
one
time
use
by
the
major
software
companies
the
method
you
are
using
to
seed
your
junk
mail
isnt
really
effective
bulk
mailers
regulary
either
send
their
databases
to
be
cleaned
by
the
ncoa
which
if
youve
moved
recently
will
revert
back
to
the
original
xxx
cool
and
in
large
mailings
there
will
likely
be
a
dupe
of
you
and
theyll
pick
the
first
and
use
the
others
for
future
mailings
btw
our
list
is
currently
one
of
the
hottest
lists
for
actual
buyers
of
a
ms
windows
utility
product
in
the
range
and
is
available
through
direct
media
in
ct
at
per
name
please
let
your
direct
mail
marketing

know
about
this
