ive
finally
decided
to
clean
out
my
closets
and
get
rid
of
some
of
the
stuff
that
is
broken
or
not
being
used
by
me
ive
put
together
a
list
and
indicated
what
i
think
each
item
is
worth
this
is
just
my
estimate
and
i
am
very
open
to
any
offers
including
trades
im
currently
looking
for
some
cdroms
that
will
work
with
a
mac
cd
rom
player
cd
caddies
hd
floppy
disks
any
used
macintosh
software
a
mhz
coprocessor
or
basically
anything
you
have
lying
around
cans
of
soup
the
neighbors
cat
etc
make
me
an
offer
no
offer
will
be
overlooked
i
really
want
to
get
rid
of
this
stuff
ok
heres
the
list
meg
scsi
hard
drive
conner
model
cp
i
bought
this
from
a
guy
at
a
swap
meet
to
use
with
my
macintosh
unfortunately
i
cant
seem
to
get
it
to
work
with
the
scsi
controller
in
my
computer
the
guy
tested
it
with
his
pc
and
printed
out
a
copy
of
the
norton
disk
doctor
report
which
says
it
has
no
bad
sectors
ill
send
you
a
copy
i
was
dumb
enough
not
to
get
his
phone
number
so
i
cant
return
it
to
him
the
drive
has
many
jumpers
on
it
which
i
dont
know
how
to
set
so
maybe
thats
the
problem
i
was
quite
disappointed
that
it
didnt
work
so
im
trying
to
minimize
my
losses
meg
scsi
hard
drive
conner
model
cp
same
situation
as
above
i
bought
both
of
these
drives
from
the
same
guy
despite
the
different
model
numbers
they
are
the
same
exact
drive
same
report
from
ndd
i
have
one
for
each
drive
will
be
included
meg
sony
scsi
hard
drive
sony
model
srda
the
drive
mechanism
is
completely
trashed
this
hard
drive
was
in
my
computer
mac
se
and
had
a
stiction
problem
well
repeated
banging
on
the
side
of
the
computer
resulted
in
a
head
crash
yes
metal
scraping
metal
which
was
not
too
pleasant
to
listen
to
still
the
scsi
controller
card
is
in
good
working
order
and
can
be
used
for
parts
or
a
project
meg
seagate
hh
scsi
hard
drive
model
stn
i
originally
bought
this
drive
because
it
had
a
small
stiction
problem
and
i
though
that
i
could
fix
it
well
i
determined
that
the
drive
mechanism
was
fine
and
that
it
was
a
controller
problem
motor
controller
wasnt
sending
proper
signals
well
after
taking
the
controller
off
the
drive
looking
at
it
and
putting
it
back
together
i
realized
that
i
accidentally
severed
one
of
the
small
flat
cables
that
connect
the
drive
to
the
controller
i
tried
to
solder
it
but
im
not
that
good
at
soldering
so
i
couldnt
do
it
worked
perfectly
before
i
messed
up
i
used
it
as
a
temporary
drive
when
the
sony
above
crashed
on
me
also
loaded
the
drive
with
about
twenty
mac
applications
worth
well
over
claris
cad
ms
word
think
c
excel
and
many
others
i
think
all
it
needs
is
a
resoldering
of
that
cable
you
also
get
all
the
software
on
the
drive
if
you
can
accept
being
a
pirate
i
only
ask
that
you
delete
my
data
files
from
the
drive
i
was
really
angry
when
i
broke
that
connection
and
then
couldnt
fix
it
i
just
dont
have
time
to
play
with
it
any
more
att
isdn
modem
this
is
for
use
on
digital
phone
systems
if
you
know
what
this
is
or
would
like
technical
information
on
it
let
me
know
i
have
some
tech
documents
on
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
same
thing
as
an
att
digital
phone
but
without
the
phone
part
it
seems
to
be
in
working
order
passes
self
test
perfectly
ok
i
have
no
idea
how
this
is
worth
let
me
know
if
youre
interested
motorola
coprocessor
i
havent
tested
this
one
out
yet
but
if
anyone
is
interested
i
will
get
it
tested
out
to
make
sure
that
it
works
i
had
trouble
using
it
with
my
accelerator
board
but
then
i
spoke
to
the
manufacturer
of
the
board
and
found
out
it
couldnt
be
used
without
another
controller
chip
when
i
was
looking
around
to
buy
one
new
the
prices
were
around
i
will
guarantee
this
to
work
cga
card
halflength
bit
wasnt
working
last
time
i
checked
although
i
think
i
was
using
a
bad
monitor
k
floppy
drive
ibm
drive
type
guaranteed
to
work
because
when
i
took
it
out
of
the
pc
it
was
working
k
floppy

toshiba
model
number
nddea
guaranteed
to
work
came
out
of
same
pc
as
above
floppy
drives
cant
guarantee
that
these
will
work
i
dont
even
know
if
they
are
low
or
high
density
drives
i
dont
have
any
method
of
testing
them

theres
also
another
number
on
it
h
toshiba
model
number
ndde
virtually
identical
to
the
one
above
each
drive
ps
drive
these
things
are
proprietary
so
i
cant
test
it
but
i
think
it
works
not
sure
if
its
high
density
or
low
density
but
i
suppose
someone
who
is
looking
for
one
would
know
model
number
dflca
i
think
these
things
are
expensive
to
replace
mfm
hard
drive
controller
cards
ive
got
three
of
these
and
i
have
no
way
of
testing
them
two
of
them
are
bit
cards
and
one
is
a
sixteen
bit
card
with
a
floppy
controller
built
in
for
the
bits

ive
sold
stuff
like
this
before
and
it
was
a
huge
success
with
many
satisfied
people
trading
or
bartering
stuff
they
didnt
need
anymore
i
usually
ship
through
the
us
postal
service
havent
had
any
problems
yet
and
the
shipping
costs
will
be
split
or
negotiated
well
thats
all
folks
as
i
said
before
no
offer
will
be
refused
if
you
can
convince
me
to
give
ocit
to
you
instead
of
throwing
it
out
try
i
hate
to
throw
away
stuff
