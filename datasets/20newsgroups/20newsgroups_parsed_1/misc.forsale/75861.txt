oh
dear
let
me
be
the
first
on
my
block
you
have
just
violated
one
of
the
major
shibboleths
of
the
usenet
groups
youre
not
supposed
to
use
a
newsgroup
to
plug
your
own
commercial
enterprise
of
any
kind
people
frequently
get
flamed
for
announcing
theyve
got
a
new
book
out
i
dont
know
whether
this
is
an
official
usenet
rule
or
just
a
long
standing
custom
and
it
doesnt
make
much
difference
from
a
practical
point
of
view
so
please
dont
do
it
again
and
all
you
others
who
are
even
now
taking
keyboard
in
hand
to
flame
him
off
the
face
of
the
earthlay
off
he
didnt
know
any
better
he
does
now
