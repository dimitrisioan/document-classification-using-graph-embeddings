i
can
no
longer
use
anything
japanese
kenwood
yeasu
icom
alinco
its
all
junk
well
im
not
sure
id
go
quite
that
far
but
i
agree
that
motorola
gear
is
of
better
quality
the
question
is
how
much
that
quality
is
worth
to
a
ham
in
amateur
service
not
commercial
service
this
radio
can
hear
a
repeater
thats
miles
away
without
an
antenna
ok
great
but
how
often
does
that
come
up
how
good
is
good
enough
and
how
much
is
someone
willing
to
pay
for
it
a
good
hamquality
ht
is
maybe
while
a
commercial
quality
one
is
maybe
is
the
increased
reliability
and
performance
worth
times
the
price
in
amateur
service
only
the
individual
involved
can
answer
that
question
and
each
ham
has
to
decide
for
himherself
if
motorola
quality
is
worth
times
the
price
to
you
then
more
power
to
ya
but
im
amazed
that
folks
make
that
choice
for
me
given
that
ive
got
to
spend
il
pick
the
yaesu
ht
and
a
nice
new
hf
rig
every
time
over
a
motorola
ht
alone
no
matter
how
good
it
is
to
me
hamquality
gear
is
good
enough
to
each
his
own
mike
npdy
these
are
my
opinions
only
