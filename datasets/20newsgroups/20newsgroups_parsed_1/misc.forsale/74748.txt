is
anybody
awake
out
there
when
someone
posted
a
message
telling
people
to
stop
posting
computer
ads
to
the
miscforsale
group
he
got
about
thirty
response
here
not
to
mention
the
rash
of
email
im
sure
he
received
yet
another
person
posts
a
message
with
the
subject
line
blow
me
and
an
even
worse
text
and
only
or
people
have
the
guts
to
say
anything
the
majority
not
to
mention
the
thread
about
selling
someones
wife
i
am
a
guy
therefore
not
overly
bummed
by
it
but
a
little
common
sense
would
dictate
that
this
is
offensive
to
many
women

but
i
was
just
thinking

wanted
to
sell
my
hpsx
calculator

in
this
newsgroup
it
is
called
a
calculator
but
really
it
is
a
computer
albeit
a
small
one
but
it
does
function
as
one
how
come
car
adds
are
acceptable
they
cant
run
without
computers
nowadays
where
does
one
draw
the
line
accept
it
live
with
it
and
if
you
care
to
avoid
it
jonathan
i
have
lots
of
common
sense
i
just
choose
to
ignore
it
