says
in
article
jason
kratz
it
is
kind
of
funny
though
how
you
were
the
only
one
who
picked
up
the
part
about
my
sister
being
a
social
worker
and
keeping
me
up
to
date
on
the
gang
thing
everyone
else
seemed
to
just
skim
by
that
part
jason
i
guess
that
just
means
everyone
else
was
mistaken
jim
actually
not
jim
i
just
said
that
everyone
else
seemed
to
have
skimmed
by
that
part
and

meaning
