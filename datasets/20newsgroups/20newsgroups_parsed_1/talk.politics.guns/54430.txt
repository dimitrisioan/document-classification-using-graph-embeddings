why
are
good
neighborhoods
good
it
isnt
because
every
person
is
armed
to
the
teeth
it
is
because
of
attitude
and
cooperation
in
the
good
neighborhoods
the
residents
make
themselves
aware
of
their
neighbors
and
notice
when
strangers
are
lurking
around
good
neighborhoods
form
groups
like
crimewatch
to
increase
this
effect
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
the
police
when
hostiles
are
arrested
the
good
neighbors
step
up
and
say
thats
the
one
officer
he
was
robbing
mr
jones
house
sometimes
this
works
sometimes
it
just
lands
your
good
neighbors
on
the
dance
card
for
the
next
wave
of
drivebys
someone

heres
a
story
that
some
of
you
may
find
amusing
its
a
story
about
arizona
househunting
from
leslie
fish
musician
and
author
one
of
the
reasons
im
planning
to
move
to
arizona
is
that
despite
its
lousy
economy
way
race
problems
simmering
religious
problems
and
hopelessly
bad
government
arizona
has
one
of
the
lowest
violent
crime
rates
in
the
country
is
it
just
coincidence
that
arizona
is
also
one
of
the
few
remaining
nogun
control
states
in
the
country
well
consider
this
funny
story
last
time
i
was
in
phoenix
staying
with
liz
burnham
i
did
some
checking
on
the
local
realestate
market
thats
when
i
discovered
that
with
my
income
as
provable
by
my
tax
returns
i
can
qualify
for
every
lowincome
housing
loan
in
the
book
with
the
exception
of
va
and
i
came
across
an
astonishing
ad
in
the
local
marketpaper
it
offered
a
threebedroom
house
in
the
phoenix
area
for
are
you
ready
for
this
all
of
no
money
down
per
month
total
payments
christ
on
a
harleydavidson
i
called
up
the
realestate
office
making
this
offer
made
it
clear
that
i
was
only
checking
the
local
market
and
asked
about
that
house
were
the
walls
roof
and
foundation
structurally
sound
yes
were
the
plumbing
and
electrical
systems
functional
and
up
to
code
yes
did
the
airconditioning
system
an
absolute
necessity
in
phoenix
work
yes
again
okay
so
what
was
wrong
with
the
house
well
it
needed
lots
of
plastering
painting
yard
work
and
some
patching
of
the
roof
and
yes
lowinterest
repair
loans
were
available
okay
sez
i
if
thats
all
thats
wrong
with
it
just
why
are
you
selling
a
bedroom
house
for
all
of
well
squirms
the
agent
its
in
kind
of
a
bad
neighborhood
how
bad
sez
i
remembering
some
of
the
neighborhoods
ive
seen
in
chicago
and
oakland
worst
in
the
city
the
agent
sighs
and
then
he
told
me
this
amazing
story
every
few
years
it
seems
the
big
vicegangs
in
los
angeles
notice
that
theres
no
gang
presence
in
phoenix
which
is
just
a
quick
hour
drive
from
la
and
get
the
idea
of
setting
up
a
subsidiary
there
well
a
couple
years
ago
the
colonizing
force
came
to
this
neighborhood
it
being
poor
and
spanish
they
figured
they
could
move
right
in
and
take
over
bought
this
house
and
started
operations
unfortunately
for
them
the
neighbors
not
only
didnt
like
this
they
didnt
care
for
whores
trotting
up
and
down
their
streets
all
night
pimps
soliciting
their
kids
dope
deals
on
the
corners
in
broad
daylight
and
so
on
they
werent
afraid
to
do
something
about
it
the
neighbors
called
the
cops
for
some
reason
the
phoenix
police
are
remarkably
honest
capable
polite
and
prompt
and
the
cops
promptly
came
and
swept
up
all
the
whores
pimps
and
pushers
off
the
street
and
away
to
jail
the
remaining
gang
members
decided
to
retaliate
in
the
fashion
they
usually
use
in
la
they
got
the
complainants
name
and
address
off
the
court
records
and
did
a
driveby
shooting
at
his
house
well
this
wasnt
los
angeles
the
moment
the
neighbors
heard
the
first
gunshots
fired
they
all
ran
out
their
front
doors
with
their
own
guns
rifles
shotguns
pistols
everything
and
shot
back
the
car
didnt
make
it
to
the
end
of
the
block
it
coasted
to
a
stop
riddled
with
more
holes
than
the
famous
bonnie
and
clyde
getaway
car
which
ive
seen
its
on
display
in
a
casino
in
a
casino
in
las
vegas
the
gas
tank
and
fuel
lines
had
been
ruptured
so
the
car
caught
fire
the
neighbors
waited
a
good
minutes
making
sure
nobody
got
out
of
that
car
before
they
called
the
fire
department
to
come
put
out
the
fire
and
tow
the
wreck
away
by
that
time
the
asphalt
under
the
car
had
melted
and
caught
fire
too
which
subsequently
left
a
large
and
nasty
pothole
in
the
street
the
city
is
slow
about
repairing
small
streets
so
the
hole
stayed
there
providing
a
traffic
hazard
for
several
months
all
this
was
two
years
ago
the
agent
concluded
and
theres
been
no
trouble
since
but
the
house
and
the
neighborhood
still
have
a
bad
reputation
and
thats
why
the
house
was
so
cheap
hearing
this
story
i
nearly
laughed
my
ass
off
i
told
the
agent
that
if
i
had
the
money
at
the
moment
id
bygod
buy
the
house
this
was
nothing
compared
to
bad
neighborhoods
id
seen
here
in
california
where
driveby
shootings
go
unchecked
by
the
wellarmed
cops
let
alone
by
the
unarmed
neighbors
if
thats
the
absolute
worst
youll
find
in
phoenix
then
thats
the
city
for
me
thats
the
difference
that
an
armed
civilian
population
makes
think
about
it
mike
van
pelt
when
guns
are
outlawed
only
carl
rowan
will
have
guns
