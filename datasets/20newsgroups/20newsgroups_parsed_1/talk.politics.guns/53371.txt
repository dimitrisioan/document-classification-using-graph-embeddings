does
anyone
really
believe
the
swiss
have
had
no
war
within
their
borders
because
every
adult
male
owns
a
rifle
im
a
great
admirer
of
the
swiss
but
years
of
peace
on
their
turf
has
zilch
to
do
with
gun
ownership
can
you
picture
hitler
with
panzers
and
fockewulfs
poised
on
the
border
losing
sleep
over
a
few
thousand
expert
rifleman
not
just
because
of
the
riflemen
they
also
have
many
hard
bunkers
in
the
mountains
that
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
penetrate
as
for
tanks
they
would
be
rather
useless
in
such
mountainous
terrain
hitler
stayed
out
of
switzerland
because
the
swiss
run
the
money
in
this
world
gee
thats
a
new
one
he
thought
it
was
a
different
ethnic
group
since
hitler
was
determined
to
control
at
the
least
all
of
europe
do
you
think
he
gave
a
damn
about
international
monetary
concerns
also
theres
a
lot
of
gold
in
swiss
vaults
dont
you
think
he
new
that
if
he
could
have
he
would
have
taken
switzerland
however
crazy
as
he
was
he
wasnt
totally
stupid
it
would
have
cost
him
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
take
switzerland
with
no
guarantee
that
an
invasion
would
be
successful
he
probably
figured
or
his
generals
did
when
he
was
listening
to
them
that
it
wasnt
worth
the
cost
