if
alcohol
were
again
banned
today
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
manage
a
largescale
smuggling
operation
the
cops
now
rank
just
a
narrow
notch
below
the
military
in
communications
intelligence
gathering
and
firepower
proof
by
assertion
i
love
it
uh
please
explain
why
the
smugglers
do
not
also
rank
a
notch
below
or
above
the
military
in
terms
of
communications
intelligence
gathering
eg
why
fight
officials
when
you
can
bribe
themill
give
you
a
hundred
grand
to
let
that
semi
past
and
firepower
in
a
similar
vein
the
amount
of
marijuana
smuggled
into
this
country
has
greatly
decreased
this
is
because
its
valueperpound
is
very
low
when
compared
to
cocaine
or
heroin
its
simply
not
worth
the
risk
its
uneconomical
now
most
reefer
is
domestic
there
is
less
pressure
on
the
domestic
producer
showy
raids
notwithstanding
and
thus
it
is
economical
of
note
though
domestic
reefer
is
now
very
strong
so
a
small
volume
goes
a
long
way
you
can
not
make
alcohol
stronger
than
proof
not
a
good
dollarpound
deal
whats
the
point
here
youre
arguing
that
the
black
market
works
which
it
does
of
course
firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
this
is
the
wrong
way
to
quantify
things
the
smuggler
would
be
concerned
about
valuecubic
foot
go
to
a
gun
show
and
price
out
a
crate
of
good
quality
handguns
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
all
production
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
whats
local
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
firearms
from
scratch
highranking
crime
figures
could
what
is
a
worthwhile
firearm
hell
anything
that
works
go
get
yourself
a
copy
of
the
armys
improvised
munitions
manual
see
how
easy
it
is
to
make
a
functional
firearm
obtain
imported
uzis
and
such
but
the
average
person
and
average
thug
would
be
lucky
to
get
a
zipgun
and
would
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
if
paying
for
inconspicuous
parts
at
the
local
kmart
is
through
the
nose
