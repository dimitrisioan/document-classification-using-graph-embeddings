my
posting
was
in
reply
to
those
about
fbi
torching
the
plasce
after
filling
it
with
napalm
and
arrested
people
dissapering
about
waco
it
looks
to
me
as
the
batf
and
fbi
cant
handle
situations
like
this
the
way
it
went
reminds
me
of
stun
bomb
beeing
dropped
on
a
house
in
la
from
a
helicopter
whole
block
went
up
in
flames
died
it
doesnt
have
to
be
a
conspiracy
maybe
they
just
screwed
up
i
dont
think
weve
got
a
conspiracy
on
our
hands
or
anything
vaugely
similar
i
do
think
that
the
feds
showed
a
distinct
lack
of
both
intelligence
and
disregard
for
others
safety
throughout
this
whole
mess
i
do
think
the
fbi
and
the
batf
screwed
up
big
what
made
me
really
concerned
was
fbi
director
william
sessions
being
on
cnn
engaging
in
what
could
only
be
called
spin
control
before
the
place
had
even
cooled
down
evertyhing
had
literally
blown
up
in
their
faces
and
i
felt
there
had
to
be
something
more
important
he
should
have
been
doing
david
veal
univ
of
tenn
div
of
cont
education
info
services
group
i
still
remember
the
way
you
laughed
the
day
your
pushed
me
down
the
elevator
shaft
im
beginning
to
think
you
dont
love
me
anymore
weird
al
