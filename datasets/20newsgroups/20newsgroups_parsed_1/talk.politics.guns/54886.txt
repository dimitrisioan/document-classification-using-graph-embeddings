im
not
trying
to
censor
this
or
any
newsgroup
im
just
trying
to
give
some
hints
about
other
newsgroups
doesnt
this
belong
to
altconspiracy
drop
three
billiard
balls
on
a
ramp
and
they
all
roll
in
the
same
direction
pour
some
blood
into
the
sea
and
sharks
will
converge
from
miles
around
throw
a
pebble
at
one
starling
and
all
will
depart
natural
processes
can
mimic
the
outward
results
of
conspiracy
when
no
actual
conspiracy
is
required
put
a
government
functionary
in
an
embarrassing
situation
and
he
quickly
covers
his
ass
this
too
is
completely
natural
about
waco
it
looks
to
me
as
the
batf
and
fbi
cant
handle
situations
like
this
it
looks
that
way
to
me
too
but
you
have
to
understand
that
its
not
the
first
time
they
have
instigated
raids
like
these
the
most
recent
one
also
ended
up
in
a
long
standoff
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
public
as
this
one
and
they
didnt
kill
quite
as
many
people
maybe
this
screwup
will
make
them
think
long
and
hard
about
raiding
any
more
residences
in
this
manner
but
probably
not
the
way
it
went
reminds
me
of
stun
bomb
beeing
dropped
on
a
house
in
la
from
a
helicopter
whole
block
went
up
in
flames
died
i
assume
youre
talking
about
philadelphia
it
doesnt
have
to
be
a
conspiracy
maybe
they
just
screwed
up
if
youre
a
fan
of
conspiracies
the
time
to
make
that
batch
of
popcorn
is
after
the
screwup
when
its
time
for
the
coverup
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
investors
