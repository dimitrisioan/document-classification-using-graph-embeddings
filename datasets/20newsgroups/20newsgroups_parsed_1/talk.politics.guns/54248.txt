do
you
rambos
who
worry
so
much
about
rape
and
murder
in
the
wilderness
also
carry
your
guns
all
the
time
at
home
too
you
should
since
youre
in
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
danger
there
than
in
the
backcountry
when
does
carrying
a
tool
classify
someone
as
a
rambo
so
all
the
pioneers
that
came
west
were
rambos
adrienne
does
anybody
reading
this
group
have
an
actual
honesttogod
experience
with
violent
crime
in
the
backcountry
to
tell
about
i
can
sort
of
understand
the
people
who
want
to
protect
themselves
from
bears
and
such
although
there
are
what
maybe
a
dozen
or
two
bear
attacks
on
people
in
north
america
each
year
but
to
worry
about
being
raped
by
some
bucktoothed
bubba
in
overalls
is
just
irrational
i
think
wed
all
be
a
lot
safer
if
all
the
videocassettes
of
deliverance
were
gathered
up
and
burned
would
your
tune
change
if
you
were
one
of
the
dozen
or
two
bear
attacks
believe
me
when
you
need
a
firearm
you
need
a
firearm
public
health
experts
will
tell
you
that
you
are
far
more
likely
have
your
gun
stolen
use
it
yourself
on
a
family
member
or
have
it
used
on
you
than
you
are
to
use
it
on
an
actual
criminal
please
cite
your
references
ill
let
others
please
note
followup
cite
valid
references
to
show
you
that
this
is
an
untruth
the
rambo
warriors
weve
heard
from
here
undoubtedly
consider
themselves
exempt
from
this
statistical
reality
theyre
much
too
smart
and
responsible
living
in
a
city
where
theres
a
driveby
shooting
every
couple
of
days
and
working
in
a
medical
center
where
a
day
doesnt
go
by
without
a
shooting
victim
coming
into
the
er
im
just
a
bit
skeptical
about
the
value
of
gun
ownership
i
go
to
the
backcountry
to
get
away
from
this
environment
and
i
dont
want
to
find
other
people
there
who
insist
on
bringing
the
urban
environment
along
with
them
boom
boxes
computers
or
guns
well
you
might
as
well
go
naked
forget
the
matches
backpack
sleeping
bag
and
all
the
rest
thats
is
a
modern
convenience
a
firearm
is
just
a
tool
as
some
people
wont
carry
gaiters
some
people
do
firearms
should
be
in
the
same
category
it
should
be
a
personal
choice
and
your
factoid
about
shooting
victims
in
the
er
count
how
many
come
in
due
to
automobile
accidents
and
automobile
crimes
maybe
we
should
outlaw
cars
please
