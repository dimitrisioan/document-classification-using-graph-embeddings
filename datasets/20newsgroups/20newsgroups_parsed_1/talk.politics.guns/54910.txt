the
bbc
are
also
reporting
that
bodies
of
bd

were
found
with
bullet
wounds
in
a
manner
that
suggests
they
may
have
been
shot
attempting
to
leave
the
compound
during
the
fire
there
is
a
possibility
that
these
are
the
bodies
of
people
killed
during
the
initial
shootout

you
imagine
what
happens
when
a
magazine
explodes
bullets
go
flying
every
where
imho
these
gunshot
wounds
were
actually
caused
when

magazines
went
up

not
a
pathologist
make
so
ill
wait
for
an
autopsy
to
determine
if
they
were
shot

way
theyre
all
dead
