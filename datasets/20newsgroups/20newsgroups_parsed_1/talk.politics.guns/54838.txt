writes
if
the
batf
and
fbi
have
become
latterday
gestapo
then
they
have
become
that
way
because
we
have
desired
them
to
be
so
we
get
to
vote
on
laws
and
on
the
lawmakers
i
keep
hearing
people
say
this
it
assumes
that
we
at
some
point
had
a
choice
at
the
ballot
box
vote
yes
or
no
i
want
the
fbi
and
batf
to
become
latterday
gestapos
that
just
isnt
so
the
process
is
far
more
complex
we
do
not
have
direct
control
over
the
bureaucracy
when
we
evaluate
our
representatives
we
dont
often
know
what
their
contribution
is
to
the
wayward
direction
of
the
federal
law
enforcement
bureacracy
to
assert
that
we
got
what
we
wanted
is
absurd
waco
was
an
encapsulation
of
the
allamerican
experience
religious
fanaticism
militaristic
thinking
and
overwhelming
violence
dont
blame
it
on
them
the
fbi
and
batf
they
were
just
acting
within
the
parameters
we
have
set
over
the
years
we
made
them
we
are
them
oh
good
i
feel
much
better
now
by
the
way
do
you
have
a
plan
for
getting
us
out
of
this
mess
we
are
in
