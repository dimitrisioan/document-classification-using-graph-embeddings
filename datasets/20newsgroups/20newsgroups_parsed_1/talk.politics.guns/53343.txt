the
usual
aaron
ray
clements
writes
yes
i
am
progun
and
yes
i
do
disagree
with
this
statement
nuclear
weapons
in
and
of
themselves
are
dangerous
radioactive
decay
of
plutonium
and
uranium
as
well
as
the
tritium
in
the
weapon
tends
to
be
somewhat
dangerous
to
living
things
can
you
say
neutron
flux
can
you
say
i
get
more
background
radiation
from
living
in
denver
or
having
an
office
in
a
limestone
building
than
i
do
standing
next
to
a
power
reactor
at
full
power
or
standing
next
to
a
nuclear
warhead
that
is
armed
look
up
shielding
in
your
dictionary
you
dont
need
six
feet
of
lead
to
make
decent
shielding
your
dead
skin
cell
layer
does
an
excellent
job
on
alpha
particles
and
neutrons
are
slowed
by
mere
water
what
do
you
think
of
you
is
plus
these
things
have
no
self
defense
purposes
its
kinda
hard
to
justify
their
use
as
a
militia
weapon
when
at
best
they
are
meant
for
battlefield
use
lowyield
weapons
or
at
worst
for
industrial
target
obliteration
translation
cities
and
population
centers
if
the
militia
has
as
its
job
the
overthrow
of
an
illegal
government
they
are
indeed
useful
weapons
to
the
militia
they
wont
be
too
useful
in
certain
areas
but
leveling
the
pentagon
would
be
a
good
thing
for
said
overthrow
and
its
likely
one
man
carrying
a
backpack
would
stand
a
better
chance
than
one
thousand
armed
with
colt
peacemakers
dont
let
selfdefense
become
the
only
reason
you
can
have
a
gun
and
your
sole
means
of
justification
myself
i
wont
overthrow
my
government
until
it
ceases
to
be
my
legal
government
but
if
i
need
to
i
want
every
weapon
i
can
get
one
can
just
as
easily
say
no
rifle
larger
than
a
is
needed
to
kill
a
human
being
they
are
right
when
that
human
being
is
wearing
armor
and
riding
in
an
apc
things
get
a
bit
different
i
dont
see
where
the
weapon
is
a
problem
its
not
only
the
manner
of
use
is
in
contention
here
not
to
mention
that
for
it
to
be
used
as
a
militia
weapon
and
expect
the
user
to
live
requires
some
sort
of
launch
vehicle
i
guess
you
either
dont
have
an
alarm
clock
or
have
never
heard
the
terms
timer
or
martyr
either
dont
forget
remote
detonation
devices
that
cb
radio
in
the
pickup
next
to
you
can
easily
transmit
ten
miles
in
decent
weather
thats
out
of
the
blast
radius
of
many
portable
nuclear
devices
just
what
is
it
about
radioactive
decay
that
has
you
worried
dan
sorenson
dod
isu
only
censors
what
i
read
not
what
i
say
dont
