does
a
not
harmful
gassing
mean
that
you
can
with
a
little
willpower
stay
inside
indefinitely
without
suffering
any
serious
health
problems
if
so
why
was
cs
often
employed
against
tunnels
in
vietnam
what
is
the
difference
anyway
cs
teargas
was
used
in
vietnam
because
it
makes
you
wretch
so
hard
that
your
stomach
comes
out
thru
your
throat
well
not
quite
that
bad
but
you
cant
really
do
much
to
defend
yourself
while
you
are
blowing
cookies

interesting
after
several
hours
worth
of
exposure
do
you
still
posess
the
presence
of
mind
to
be
able
to
determine
how
to
escape
from
an
inferno
surrounding
you
in
other
words
is
it
possible
that
the
prolonged
gassing
disoriented
the
wackos
enough
that
possibility
of
escape
was
rendered
questionable
