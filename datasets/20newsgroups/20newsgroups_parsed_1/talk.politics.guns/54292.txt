i
hate
long
postings
but
this
turned
out
to
be
rather
lengthy
thats
ok
you
can
mail
me
if
you
want
more
discussion
acquiring
weapons
in
norway
you
can
buy
almost
all
kinds
of
weapons
in
norway
but
you
must
have
a
permit
and
a
good
reason
to
get
the
permit
around
here
longguns
are
proof
of
age
and
fill
out
the
forms
for
pistols
nationwide
check
for
felonies
and
three
days
wait
the
good
reason
is
the
difference
and
one
americans
tend
to
get
annoyed
over
as
we
see
no
reason
the
guy
with
the
badge
is
any
better
than
us
its
a
little
like
getting
a
drivers
licence
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
before
you
are
allowed
to
not
when
dealing
with
america
i
can
drive
an
wheel
truck
with
no
permit
no
license
and
at
age
if
im
engaged
in
farming
work
strange
that
but
there
is
little
to
no
problem
with
this
again
personal
rights
versus
collective
security
some
crimes
are
commited
with
guns
that
have
been
in
the
owners
arms
for
a
long
time
but
these
are
rather
the
exeption
most
criminals
accuire
guns
to
use
them
in
crimes
and
mostly
short
time
befor
the
crime
strange
that
the
rates
would
decline
since
killing
somebody
is
much
more
frowned
upon
than
merely
stealing
a
gun
use
of
knives
it
is
allowed
to
cary
knifes
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
americans
think
its
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carry
it
open
in
public
rigth
why
attract
attention
i
carry
my
sword
openly
to
and
from
practice
as
that
is
the
only
legal
thing
i
can
do
i
also
attract
a
lot
of
attention
doing
this
id
rather
be
lost
in
a
crowd
of
one
than
be
the
subject
of
attention
while
carrying
a
weapon
think
of
the
word
intimidation
and
you
can
see
where
intimidation
is
not
the
preferable
method
for
the
normal
citizen
scandinavians
are
aggressive
we
northeners
are
not
as
hotlivered
as
southeners
but
when
we
decide
to
take
action
we
do
ask
any
historian
or
millitary
with
an
knowledge
of
europe
or
ask
any
german
who
served
in
norway
in
ww
aggressive
towards
whom
southerners
germans
precisely
why
i
think
your
society
is
less
violent
weapons
aside
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
masses
editor
barf
dan
then
the
masses
have
the
same
rights
as
the
individuals
because
everything
comes
down
to
the
individual
in
one
instance
or
another
to
draw
an
analogy
norway
is
involved
in
the
eec
the
usa
in
involved
in
nato
the
eec
requires
certain
changes
in
your
laws
nato
requires
no
such
changes
in
usa
law
these
laws
affect
citizens
and
hence
norway
is
saying
europe
is
more
important
than
say
norwegians
having
motorcycles
that
make
over
bhp
in
the
usa
wed
likely
tell
the
eec
to
get
stuffed
since
the
eec
has
no
business
in
our
eyes
in
telling
us
how
much
horsepower
we
can
safely
ride
while
i
note
that
our
own
state
governments
often
play
with
game
with
the
federal
government
in
essence
this
is
a
cultural
difference
between
us
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
it
shouldnt
since
neither
of
our
countries
has
managed
to
remove
criminals
from
society
in
america
we
feel
and
remember
we
have
individual
states
that
are
larger
than
your
country
that
if
the
police
can
not
protect
us
then
we
must
do
so
ourselves
the
criminals
in
our
country
are
quite
violent
hence
we
prepare
for
them
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns
like
candy
some
states
do
if
you
believe
its
smartneccacery
to
have
driverslicence
why
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
guns
we
dont
email
me
to
find
out
just
how
difficult
it
really
is
in
this
country
it
is
easier
than
in
yours
but
theft
is
far
easier
than
the
troubles
we
go
through
to
purchase
over
here
i
would
defend
my
home
loved
ones
and
country
but
i
dont
view
guns
as
neccities
or
toys
they
are
neither
they
are
an
option
we
would
never
force
you
to
own
guns
if
you
lived
here
we
would
however
fight
to
keep
that
option
open
to
you
i
have
done
army
service
and
have
used
a
variaty
of
weapons
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
one
for
self
defence
or
because
they
feel
good
then
you
show
you
are
a
responsible
rational
user
of
weapons
welcome
to
our
ranks
now
how
do
we
teach
the
young
people
this
sort
of
responsibility
cultures
seem
to
have
a
grave
impact
here
i
notice
you
didnt
use
my
greatgrandfathers
name
well
he
didnt
like
it
much
either
