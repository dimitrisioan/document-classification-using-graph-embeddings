i
wrote
a
letter
the
other
day
to
empower
america
the
organization
which
claims
to
be
championing
conservative
issues
esp
in
the
wake
of
the
republican
defeat
last
fall
some
might
consider
them
just
a
an
organization
to
create
a
network
of
support
among
conservatives
for
some
individuals
in
prep
for
run
youd
be
close
to
the
truth
their
two
leading
spokesmen
are
bill
bennett
former
drug
czar
who
heartily
supported
bushs
semiauto
import
ban
and
wondered
if
it
went
far
enough
who
helped
put
the
big
lie
about
sporting
use
into
the
publics
eye
and
jack
kemp
who
recently
came
out
in
support
of
semiauto
bans
these
are
conservatives
anyway
i
thought
it
interesting
that
when
i
ran
word
perfects
spell
check
against
my
letter
it
came
up
with
the
following
corrections
for
bennett
banned
bayonet
needless
to
say
i
found
these
choices
rather
amusing
it
collectivism
vs
individualism
is
an
ancient
conflict
men
have
come
close
to
the
truth
but
it
was
destroyed
each
time
and
one
civilization
fell
after
another
civilization
is
the
progress
toward
a
society
of
privacy
the
savages
whole
existence
is
public
ruled
by
the
laws
of
his
tribe
civilization
is
the
process
of
setting
man
free
from
men
ayn
rand
roarks
speech
from
the
fountainhead
i
dont
speak
for
my
company
we
hire
the
politically
correct
to
do
that
