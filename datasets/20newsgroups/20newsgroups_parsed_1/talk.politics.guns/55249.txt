according
to
wnci
fm
radio
this
morning
dayton
ohio
is
operating
a
gun
buy
back
they
are
giving
for
every
functional
gun
turned
in
they
ran
out
of
money
in
one
day
and
are
now
passing
out
vouchers
of
some
sort
they
are
looking
for
more
funds
to
keep
operating
another
mediaevent
brought
to
you
by
hci
is
there
something
similar
progun
people
can
do
for
example
pay
to
anyone
who
lawfully
protects
their
life
with
a
firearm
sounds
a
bit
tacky
but
hey
whatever
works
as
david
veal
points
out
this
sort
of
promotion
would
be
used
against
gun
owners
by
the
mass
media
however
here
is
my
proposal
offer
gun
safety
classes
in
your
area
free
as
a
community
service
such
a
class
would
normally
cost
or
so
offering
it
free
is
a
good
promotion
our
gun
club
has
organized
several
of
these
we
just
finished
teaching
another
one
last
night
in
fact
and
they
have
been
very
well
received
we
get
a
lot
of
people
who
are
novices
interested
in
guns
we
even
get
a
few
who
are
antigun
but
feel
they
should
know
something
about
gun
safety
since
members
of
their
family
keep
guns
at
home
teaching
such
a
course
gives
us
many
desirable
benefits
we
have
the
chance
to
teach
gun
safety
rules
this
increases
firearm
awareness
and
may
help
to
reduce
gun
accident
stats
a
gun
safety
class
is
politically
correct
and
likely
to
be
viewed
positively
by
the
public
and
the
media
most
of
the
students
are
normal
people
not
gun
enthusiasts
and
this
kind
of
class
gives
us
the
chance
to
give
them
a
gentle
introduction
to
firearms
some
of
the
students
are
enthusiastic
and
will
purchase
a
gun
and
become
more
involved
in
shooting
or
personal
defense
it
improves
the
public
perception
of
our
club
and
gun
owners
in
general
our
students
see
that
we
are
all
reasonable
nonaggressive
softspoken
people
which
helps
to
mitigate
the
standard
image
of
a
hardcore
gun
owner
even
antigun
students
sometimes
tell
us
they
have
something
new
to
think
about
with
regards
to
personal
gun
ownership
sharing
our
experience
with
others
is
a
lot
of
fun
our
course
is
the
standard
nracertified
home
firearm
safety
class
and
our
students
pay
only
for
materials
we
also
teach
the
nras
personal
protection
class
although
the
cost
is
higher
for
that
one
since
we
have
to
purchase
range
time
i
think
firearms
safety
classes
are
an
excellent
response
to
gun
buybacks
alane
nobody
shares
my
opinions
i
am
a
jelly
doughnut
especially
not
my
employer
