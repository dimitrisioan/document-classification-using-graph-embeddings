re
reasonable
for
criminals
civie
arms
limits
in
article
writes
a
poster
claims
he
always
asks
antigunners
what
they
think
would
be
reasonable
personal
firepower
restrictions
ok
then
caliber
not
greater
than
muzzle
not
greater
than
ftlbs
with
any
combo
of
bullet
wtvel
action
single
shot
rifles
and
single
action
revolvers
revolvers
bearing
no
more
than
six
rounds
and
incorporating
an
antifanning
mechanism
to
discourage
roy
rogers
wannabes
bullets
any
nonexplosive
variety
hps
just
fine
now
these
specs
leave
the
hr
magnum
as
about
the
most
powerful
allowable
civie
cartridge
for
handgun
or
rifle
use
it
would
be
reasonably
effective
against
home
intruders
muggers
rabid
wolves
and
other
such
nasties
even
with
the
firearmtype
limitations
at
the
same
time
this
caliberpower
limit
would
reduce
the
ultimate
lethality
of
hits
i
suspect
that
you
think
that
this
is
less
lethal
than
the
typical
assault
weapon
you
are
wrong
compared
to
what
most
criminals
use
a
mm
with
military
ammo
fmjs
or
a
military
rifle
use
is
extremely
rare
or
mm
with
military
ammo
fmjs
the
hr
magnum
with
civie
bullets
is
more
lethal
most
of
the
arms
which
criminals
and
the
military
use
are
among
the
least
lethal
arms
in
existance
what
if
we
just
punish
the
criminal
and
leave
the
law
abiding
citizen
alone
it
hasnt
been
tried
in
recient
times
but
it
might
work
