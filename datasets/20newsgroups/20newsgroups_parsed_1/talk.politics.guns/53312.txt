no
you
havent
read
it
very
closely
it
says
you
may
answer
no
if
your
civil
rights
have
been
restored
that
can
be
done
either
by
the
feds
or
a
a
state
i
think
the
feds
stopped
doing
this
for
those
convicted
of
violent
felonies
at
least
a
dozen
states
still
restore
a
felons
civil
rights
some
immediately
upon
release
some
after
a
waiting
period
i
will
post
a
list
of
the
states
later
a
quick
question
then
larry
if
a
persons
civil
rights
have
been
restored
then
are
they
still
considered
a
felon
good
question
i
dont
know
what
the
law
considers
them
imo
if
rights
have
been
restored
then
it
makes
sense
to
me
that
the
record
of
the
felony
and
everything
else
has
been
purged
and
the
person
in
question
is
no
longer
a
felon
i
believe
this
is
what
happens
in
some
states
