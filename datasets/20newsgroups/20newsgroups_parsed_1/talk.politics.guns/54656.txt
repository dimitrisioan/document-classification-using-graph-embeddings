bill

writes
just
to
shed
some
light
on
the
fire
it
was
widely
reported
ap
etc
that
there
were
several
witnesses
to
bd
folks
starting
the
fires
it
has
also
been
reported
that
the
fires
broke
out
in
several
places
at
once
which
rules
out
a
bradley
knocking
over
a
lamp
etc
as
the
cause
widely
reported
eh
remember
this
has
had
a
news
blackout
since
day
the
fbi
is
the
single
sole
source
of
these
rumors
it
may
be
the
truth
but
it
may
not
be
we
may
never
know
we
must
question
it
though
why
no
media
coverare
what
were
they
hiding
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
serious
discussion
of
this
incident
i
believe
the
moves
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn
and
nightline
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
th
raid
it
would
seem
so
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
they
would
still
be
alive
today
another
day
is
another
chance
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
i
think
it
contributed
to
the
outcome
folks
that
are
sleep
deprived
tend
not
to
think
clearly
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
i
feel
strongly
they
were
not
proper
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
as
expected
if
it
had
come
out
well
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
take
full
credit
jim
im
always
rethinking
that
theres
never
been
a
day
when
i
havent
rethought
that
but
i
cant
do
that
by
myself
