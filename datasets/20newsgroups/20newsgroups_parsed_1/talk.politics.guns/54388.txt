weaver
suspected

dealing
with
an
informant
i
had
a
guy
in
spokane
tell
me
you
were
bad
fadeley
managed
to
convince
weaver
otherwise
the
idaho
statesman
states
explicitly
that
three
tapes
were
made
of
conversations
with
randy
weaver
thus
each
of
these
meetings
must
have
been
recorded
however
the

also
reported
that
a
tape
of
a
telephone
conversation
involving
vicki
weaver
randy
weavers
wife
was
played
to
the
court
there
must
have
also
been
phone
taps
these
tapes
were
played
to
the

via
both
headphones
and
loudspeakers
under
the
objections
of
gerry
spence
weavers
attorney

to
a
ktvb

that
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
government
proved
its
case
if
it
has
a
case
at
all
according
to
the
rules
randy
weaver
tore
off
his
headphones
and
wept
when
he
heard
his
wifes
voice
on
the
tape
us
district
court
judge
edward
lodge
asked
jurors
not
to
hear
accounts
of
the
waco
fire
because
of
possible
influences
on
the
weaverharris
case
exactly
how
such
information
could
affect
this
trial
is
not
explained
other
notes
sunday
evening
there
was
a
report
on
ktvb
concerning
kevin
harris
unnamed
agents
within
the
fbi
admit
that
they
are
surprised
that
kevin
harris
is
still
alive
first
they
were
surprised
that
he
survived
the
initial
gunshot
wounds
sustained
in
the
initial
firefight
at
the
yjunction
later
when
randy
weaver
was
struck
by
sniper
fire
the
sniper
had
reported
that
harris
had
been
struck
not
weaver
finally
there
was
a
report
that
the
fbi
agent
who
killed
vicki
weaver
believed
he
was
aiming
at
kevin
harris
instead
this
is
what
was
reported
critics
are
charging
that
the
fbi
was
blatantly
trying
to
eliminate
the
only
nongovernment
witness
to
the
deaths
of
samuel
weaver
and
deputy
marshal
william
degan
some
local
people
believe
that
harriss
survival
is
simply
due
to
divine
intervention
tuesday
april
will
be
the
sixth
day
of
the
trial
kenneth
fadeleys
testimony
is
scheduled
to
continue
