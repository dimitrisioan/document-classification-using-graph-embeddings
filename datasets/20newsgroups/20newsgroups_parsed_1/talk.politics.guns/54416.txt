watch
from

miles
away
far
enough
away
that
whatever
really
happenned
must
be
explained
through
the
vengeful
filter
of
a
humiliated
agency
that
said
quote
enough
is
enough
please
tell
me
what
you
think
would
have
happened
had
the
people
come
out
with
their
hands
up
several
weeks
ago
no
answer
you
didnt
answer
the
question
the
fbi
took
people
out
of
camera
range
it
is
thus
possible
that
they
were
engaging
in
questionable
activities
i
do
not
feel
like
the
cameras
were
out
of
range
cameras
watched
the
first
confrontation
cameras
watched
the
banners
cmaeras
watched
the
final
confrontation
with
tanks
cameras
watched
the
fire
when
werent
cameras
able
to
watch
when
would
cameras
be
unable
to
watch
people
coming
out
with
their
hands
up
as
to
your
question
please
tell
me
what
you
think
would
have
happened
had
the
atf
goon
squad
knocked
and
asked
politely
several
weeks
ago
as
opposed
to
playing
rambo
with
a
tv
crew
in
tow
well
that
is
what
batf
should
have
done
either
koresh
would
have
gone
peaceably
as
he
has
done
in
the
past
or
perhaps
it
was
already
too
close
to
the
apocalypse
in
his
own
mind
it
is
hard
to
predict
the
actions
of
a
leader
who
would
not
release
the
children
when
most
rational
people
would
now
will
you
answer
my
