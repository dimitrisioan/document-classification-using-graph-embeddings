analysis
was
fbi
directors
statement
in
article
brett
costley
said
sigh
i
just
dont
understand
why
they
couldnt
have
waited
koreshco
out
uh
maybe
because
it
was
costing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
a
day
to
just
sit
and
wait
yeah
we
dont
want
to
spend
too
much
money
preserving
lives
after
all
escpecially
when
theyre
all
just
a
bunch
of
crazy
fanatic
cultists
anyway
instead
of
normal
people
the
above
is
supposed
to
be
dripping
with
sarcasm
but
im
too
burned
out
right
now
get
it
burned
out
ha
ha
to
tell
if
its
working
look
folks
what
david
koresh
and
his
followers
were
was
broken
it
takes
a
certain
amount
of
flexibility
and
insanity
to
survive
in
this
world
and
they
didnt
have
enough
of
it
and
that
wasnt
their
fault
so
please
stop
dancing
on
their
graves
okay
