you
ever
been
violently
sick
repeatedly
i

and
it

through
a
building
full
of
smoke
and
debris

when
most

already
disoriented
from
lack
of
sleep
and
constant
psychological
abuse
throw

the

that
the

outside
consists
of
people
who
have
shot
at
me
and
thrown
grenades
at
me
and
are
currently
knocking
my
