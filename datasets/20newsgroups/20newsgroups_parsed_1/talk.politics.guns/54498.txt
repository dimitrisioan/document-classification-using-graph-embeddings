get
any

this
is
really
stupid
nitpicking
capitalization
rules
in
the
late
th
century
were
quite
different
from
today
and
what
was
posted
matches
current
capitalization
rules
we
also
dont

like
f
and
other
such
things
done
in
the
late
seventeen
hundreds
in
the
original
constitution
militia
arms
etc
were
capitalized
simply
because
they
were
nouns
this
is
also
done
currently
in
german
there
is
no
special
significance
to
these
words
simply
because
they
are
capitalized
the
capitalization
denotes
no
special
emphasis
