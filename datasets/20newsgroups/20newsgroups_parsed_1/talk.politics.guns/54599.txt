to
do
if

i
have
heard
many
opinions
on
this
subject
and
would
like
to
hear
more
from
the
people
on
the
net
say
youre
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebody
you
give
them
a
chance
to
get
away
but
they
decided
to
continue
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shooting
and
killing
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cops
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provided
of
course
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
what
kind
of
laws
are
on
the
books
regarding
this
type
of
situation
what
would
be
the
most
likely
thing
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stayed
and
waited
and
it
was
a
first
offense
what
would
happen
if
you
took
off
but
someone
saw
you
and
you
were
caught
in
massachusetts
you
will
likely
be
arrested
for
murder
but
if
you
convince
the
copsda
that
you
used
lethal
force
because
of
threat
of
death
or
serious
bodily
harm
then
the
charges
would
probably
be
dropped
if
you
run
away
and
are
later
caught
then
you
will
have
a
much
harder
time
convincing
copsjudgejury
of
your
innocence
going
on
the
lam
is
seen
as
an
indication
of
guilt
by
a
lot
of
people
