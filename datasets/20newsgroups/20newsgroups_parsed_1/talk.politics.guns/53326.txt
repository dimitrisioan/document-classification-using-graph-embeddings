breakins
re
minutes
on
a
los
angeles
radio
station
last
weekend
the
lawyers
for
the
family
of
the
murdered
rancher
said
that
the
los
angeles
sheriffs
department
had
an
assessment
done
of
the
ranchers
property
before
the
raid
this
strongly
implies
that
the
sheriffs
department
wanted
the
property
any
drugs
which
were
not
found
were
only
an
excuse
in
viet
nam
lt
calley
was
tried
and
convicted
of
murder
because
his
troops
in
a
war
setting
deliberately
killed
innocent
people
it
is
time
that
the
domestic
law
enforcement
agencies
in
this
country
adhere
to
standards
at
least
as
moral
as
the
militarys
greed
killed
the
rancher
possibly
greed
killed
the
davidian
children
government
greed
it
is
time
to
prosecute
the
leaders
who
perform
these
invasions
fred
franceschi
these
are
my
own
opinions
