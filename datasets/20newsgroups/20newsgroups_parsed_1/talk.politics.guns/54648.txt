oh
then
i
guess
that
shooting
those
kind
of
babies
is
all
right
you
sick
bastard
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
investors
packet
why
thanks
for
your
reply
to
my
post
by
the
way
i
never
never
ever
said
that
it
was
right
to
shoot
those
kind
of
babies
however
it
was
the
branch
davidian
people
in
there
that
insisted
on
staying
there
with
their
savior
yeah
right
budy
boy
because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his
cause
therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the
atfs
who
gave
them
to
days
to
get
out
this
was
days
to
many
for
me
and
for
goodness
sake
if
they
had
fired
a
cruise
missile
at
the
compound
more
people
would
have
come
out
alive
it
was
obvious
to
anyone
with
the
remotest
contact
with
reality
that
such
an
outcome
was
likely
not
just
possible
however
the
fire
started
as
mr
lawnmower
you
seem
to
have
already
entered
your
own
little
virtual
reality
i
guess
you
cant
be
expected
to
understand
things
in
the
real
universe
