good
question
take
an
objective
look
at
what
happened
listen
to
the
things
that
the
fbi
said
the
bds
started
the
fire
the
bds
bodies
were
found
with
gunshot
wounds
that
are
now
being
refuted
by
the
evidence
being
recovered
seems
that
the
fbi
is
deliberately
making
statements
that
have
no
rational
basis
in
fact
and
trying
to
make
them
sound
like
fact
thats
another
sad
thing
id
expect
this
sort
of
shit
from
the
batf
but
im
goddamn
disappointed
in
the
fbi
they
used
to
be
professionals
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
