date
apr
i
cant
speak
for
the
organizations
you
cited
but
everywhere
you
look
in
our
society
and
government
one
can
see
the
relentless
movement
toward
one
world
government
the
fact
that
the
media
demeans
such
charished
values
as
patriotism
nationalism
and
protectionism
are
some
of
the
cluesour
porous
border
both
people
and
trade
are
an
indiciation
that
we
have
already
lost
a
great
deal
of
sovergnty
and
im
sure
that
people
who
were
big
fans
of
fuedalism
pissed
and
moaned
about
the
emergence
of
the
modern
nationstate
imagine
the
king
allowing
serfs
their
freedom
if
they
could
live
in
the
city
for
a
year
times
change
technology
changes
viable
forms
of
social
organization
change
while
concerns
about
preserving
western
notions
of
civil
liberties
in
the
face
of
cultures
with
very
different
values
is
a
valid
one
its
a
waste
of
effort
to
try
to
turn
back
the
tide
its
much
smarter
to
focus
on
trying
to
make
sure
that
the
emerging
forms
of
social
organization
are
acceptable
than
it
iss
to
lament
the
passing
of
the
old
forms
