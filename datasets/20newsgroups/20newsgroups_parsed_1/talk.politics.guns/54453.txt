re
some
more
about
gun
control
in
article
charles
scripter
writes
this
mention
of
a
well
regulated
militia
is
what
confuses
me
according
to
the
federalist
papers
a
well
regulated
militia
has
a
well
defined
structure
and
follows
nationally
uniform
regulations
perhaps
you
should
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
perhaps
you
should
reread
federal
which
deals
exclusively
with
the
well
regulated
malitia
here
is
what
is
says
about
its
character
to
oblige
the
great
body
of
the
yeomanry
and
of
the
other
classes
of
the
citizens
to
be
under
arms
for
the
purpose
of
going
through
military
exercises
and
evolutions
as
often
as
might
be
necessary
to
acquire
the
degree
of
perfection
which
would
entitle
them
to
the
character
of
a
wellregulated
militia
it
also
talks
about
the
well
regulated
militia
having
a
nationally
uniform
in
structure
and
disipline
i
will
note
you
did
quote
the
end
of
this
particular
paragraph
which
states
little
more
can
reasonably
be
aimed
at
with
respect
to
the
people
at
large
than
to
have
them
properly
armed
and
equipped
and
in
order
to
see
that
this
be
not
neglected
it
will
be
necessary
to
assemble
them
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
a
year
but
do
you
knew
how
much
organization
is
required
to
training
a
large
group
of
poeple
twice
a
year
just
to
try
to
get
the
same
people
every
year
provide
a
basic
training
to
new
people
so
they
can
be
integrated
into
the
force
and
find
a
suitable
location
it
requires
a
continually
standing
committee
of
organizers
since
a
well
regulate
militia
is
nationally
uniform
in
structure
and
disipline
and
meet
once
or
twice
a
year
to
train
how
can
you
claim
a
well
regulated
militia
is
not
well
organized
but
i
will
concide
a
well
organized
militia
is
not
necessarily
a
well
regulated
militia
several
people
have
stated
that
the
well
organized
militia
is
what
is
defined
under
usc
which
states
the
militia
of
the
united
states
consists
of
all
ablebodied
males
at
least
years
of
age
and
except
as
provided
in
section
of
title
under
years
of
age
who
are
or
who
have
made
a
declaration
of
intention
to
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
female
citizents
of
the
united
states
who
are
commissioned
officers
of
the
national
guard
this
deos
define
the
militia
but
were
is
the
adjective
well
regulated
usc
does
not
define
a
well
regualed
militia
in
any
way
shape
or
form
it
only
defines
who
can
become
part
of
a
well
regulated
militia
the
federalist
papers
clearly
define
the
well
regualed
militia
as
a
proper
subset
of
the
militia
in
the
same
paragraph
quoted
above
it
talk
above
disciplining
all
the
militia
of
the
united
states
so
they
fit
the
character
of
a
wellregulated
militia
this
is
what
the
paragraph
states
about
the
associated
costs
it
would
form
an
annual
deduction
from
the
productive
labor
of
the
country
to
an
amount
which
calculating
upon
the
present
numbers
of
the
people
would
not
fall
far
short
of
the
whole
expense
of
the
civil
establishments
of
all
the
states
to
attempt
a
thing
which
would
abridge
the
mass
of
labor
and
industry
to
so
considerable
an
extent
would
be
unwise
and
the
experiment
if
made
could
not
succeed
because
it
would
not
long
be
endured
another
quote
provide
by
charles
scripter
is
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
so
the
phrase
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
must
either
qualify
or
explain
the
phrase
a
well
regulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
definition
of
explain
as
stated
in
the
american
hertitage
dictionary
of
the
enlish
language
the
new
college
edition
is
to
make
plain
or
comprehensible
remove
obscruity
from
elucidate
it
was
the
economists
who
undertook
to
explain
this
puzzle
to
define
explicate
expound
he
explained
his
plan
to
offer
reasons
for
or
a
cause
of
an
answer
for
justify
explain
an
error
the
second
phrase
clearly
does
not
explain
the
first
therefore
the
second
phrase
must
qualify
the
first
the
definition
given
for
qualify
is
to
describe
by
enumerating
the
characteristics
or
qualities
of
characterize
to
make
competent
or
suitable
for
office
position
or
task
to
give
legal
power
to
make
legally
capable
to
modify
limit
or
restrict
as
giving
exceptions
to
make
less
harsh
or
severe
moderate
grammar
to
modify
the
meaning
of
a
word
or
phrase
since
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
does
not
describe
modify
or
make
less
harsh
anything
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
grammar
or
some
sort
of
position
or
task
by
process
of
elimination
it
must
fall
into
definition
and
since
deals
with
legal
power
the
same
thing
the
constitution
does
it
must
be
the
correct
definition
in
this
case
therefore
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
gives
legal
power
to
the
well
regualated
militia
and
this
legal
power
shall
not
be
infringed
i
thank
you
very
much
mr
scripter
you
have
provided
me
with
more
evidence
that
the
second
amendment
only
concerns
itseft
with
the
peoples
right
to
form
well
regulate
militia
and
says
very
little
about
the
right
of
an
untrained
person
to
keep
and
bear
a
caliber
machine
gun
and
since
i
totally
untrained
in
the
use
of
any
firearm
something
i
personly
have
meant
to
correct
by
going
to
a
nra
gun
safety
course
and
joining
a
gun
club
can
not
legally
buy
such
a
machine
gun
i
conclude
the
courts
and
democraticly
elected
congress
agree
with
me
so
now
we
know
which
category
mr
rutledge
is
in
he
means
to
destroy
our
liberties
and
rights
i
mean
to
destory
our
liberties
and
rights
is
that
why
a
participate
in
the
discussion
of
exactly
what
our
libertues
and
rights
are
i
force
my
version
of
our
liberties
and
rights
by
begining
statements
of
what
our
liberties
and
rights
with
all
that
the
second
amendment
clearly
states
to
me
using
expressions
such
as
states
to
me
clearly
mean
i
intend
to
force
my
views
on
others
i
dont
think
so
so
in
effort
not
to
force
my
views
and
not
to
destory
our
liberties
and
rights
i
state
that
nothing
i
have
written
or
will
write
in
the
matter
of
liberties
and
rights
is
the
final
word
for
i
am
only
one
person
among
many
and
the
final
word
on
liberties
and
rights
cleary
and
irrevocably
belongs
to
the
many
if
only
it
were
a
modern
document
with
a
john
lawrence
rutledge
smart
index
and
hyper
links
stretching
all
research
assistant
through
the
world
data
net
it
was
terribly
frustrating
to
flip
back
and
forth
between
interactive
media
group
the
pages
and
crude
flat
illustrations
that
computer
science
department
never
even
moved
nor
were
there
animated
umass
lowell
arrows
or
zoomins
it
completely
lacked
a
university
ave
for
sound
lowell
ma
most
baffling
of
all
was
the
problem
of
new
words
in
normal
text
youd
only
have
to
touch
an
unfamiliar
word
and
the
definition
would
pop
up
just
