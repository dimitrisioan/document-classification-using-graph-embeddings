about
causes
of
people
in
er
and
your
factoid
about
shooting
victims
in
the
er
count
how
many
come
in
due
to
automobile
accidents
and
automobile
crimes
maybe
we
should
outlaw
cars
marciano
there
are
a
lot
of
automobile
accidents
but
atleast
there
is
some
regulation
to
try
to
combat
this
such
as
drunk
drivers
get
back
on
the
road
in
no
time
to
kill
again
seems
the
drivers
license
process
does
not
work
for
this
when
i
got
my
drivers
license
i
had
to
take
a
drivers
safety
class
because
you
wanted
one
while
you
were
underage
i
have
to
be
licensed
to
drive
only
on
public
roads
my
car
must
be
registered
only
if
it
is
to
be
driven
on
public
roads
other
than
between
segments
of
my
property
i
must
at
least
where
i
live
have
liability
insurance
on
both
myself
driving
and
my
car
if
someone
else
had
an
accident
with
it
only
on
public
roads
hmm
wouldnt
manditory
saftey
classes
registration
of
both
the
owner
and
gun
and
manditory
liability
insurance
be
nice
for
gun
owners
perhaps
if
it
gave
them
permission
to
shoot
in
public
roads
and
parks
