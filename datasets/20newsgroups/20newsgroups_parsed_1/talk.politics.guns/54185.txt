re
my
gun
is
like
my
in
article
writes
what
all
you
turkey
propistol
and
automatic
weapons
fanatics
dont
seem
to
realize
is
that
the
rest
of
us
laugh
at
you
so
what
we
think
youre
pretty
hilarious
too
i
love
how
you
brits
kiss
royal
arse
that
youre
willing
to
throw
out
freedomofspeech
for
the
sake
of
protecting
the
reputation
of
the
royal
sluts
that
the
british
government
advertised
in
american
newspapers
send
a
gun
to
defend
a
british
home
british
civilians
faced
with
threat
of
invasion
desperately
need
arms
for
the
defense
of
their
homes
during
wwii
american
rifleman
november
that
the
obscene
publications
act
and
the
misuse
of
drugs
act
have
been
used
as
justification
for
the
police
to
seize
masterpieces
such
as
william
s
burroughs
junky
hunter
thompsons
fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
and
tom
wolfes
the
electric
koolaid
acid
test
british
courts
have
never
recognized
the
right
to
assemble
or
to
demonstrate
that
evidence
obtained
form
coerced
confessions
is
allowed
in
a
trial
that
only
serious
felonies
warrant
a
trial
by
jury
that
suspected
terrorists
must
prove
their
innocence
instead
of
the
government
having
to
prove
their
guilt
that
the
secretary
of
state
may
issue
an
exclusionary
order
which
bars
someone
from
ever
entering
a
particular
part
of
the
united
kingdom
such
as
northern
ireland
or
wales
that
the
bbc
banned
paul
mccartneys
give
ireland
back
to
the
irish
as
well
as
john
lennons
give
peace
a
chance
during
the
gulf
war
yes
england
is
very
very
funny
and
very
pathetic
i
knew
somebody
else
who
went
to
one
of
your
gunmart
superstore
places
just
so
he
could
experience
the
sight
of
people
putting
guns
and
ammo
into
shopping
carts
i
didnt
believe
it
myself
until
i
drove
by
one
in
vegas
last
year
so
what
laughter
is
a
way
of
dealing
with
things
we
find
uncomfortable
i
thought
the
las
vegas
show
girl
ads
on
las
vegas
street
corners
were
pretty
funny
yes
indeed
there
are
many
strange
and
wonderous
things
in
this
country
i
wouldnt
have
it
any
other
way
now
that
i
live
in
britain
i
can
see
how
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
perceives
you
gunnut
morons
the
bbc
recently
referred
to
the
american
penchant
for
pistols
automatic
weaponsetc
very
appropriately
it
was
called
a
national
eccentricity
i
dont
disagree
with
that
i
dont
think
its
bad
either
the
only
problem
is
that
canada
i
hear
is
suffering
from
your
national
eccentricity
in
that
easy
to
purchase
weapons
are
being
smuggled
cross
the
border
so
what
if
they
didnt
come
from
here
they
would
come
from
elsewhere
disguised
as
cocaine
anyway
all
you
gun
nut
rush
limbaugh
fans
please
keep
up
your
diatribes
against
brady
and
other
evil
liberal
media
plots
you
re
so
damn
funny
you
provide
endless
amounts
of
entertainment
in
your
arguments
and
examples
of
why
someone
should
be
allowed
to
carry
a
piece
keep
us
all
chuckling
you
can
laugh
all
you
want
for
us
its
a
matter
of
life
or
death
i
dont
find
that
funny
in
the
least
as
for
england
as
our
allies
become
more
open
britain
grow
yet
more
secretive
and
censorious
perhaps
the
real
british
vice
is
passivity
a
willingness
to
tolerate
constraints
which
others
would
find
unbearble
in
britain
an
unfree
country
