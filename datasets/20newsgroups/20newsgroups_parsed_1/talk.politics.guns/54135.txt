self
defense
is
a
valid
reason
for
rkba
the
vast
majority
get
through
life
without
ever
having
to
own
use
or
display
a
firearm
you
might
have
missed
the
us
news
world
report
excerpt
i
posted
it
is
fairly
consistant
with
other
such
polls
finding
that
approximately
of
households
have
at
least
one
firearm
how
this
translates
into
individual
ownership
is
questionable
but
i
think
its
fairly
safe
to
say
that
youre
wrong
about
the
vast
majority
ok
a
nearmajority
actually
own
firearms
but
i
will
still
claim
that
the
vast
majority
never
needs
to
use
them
or
even
threaten
anyone
with
them
what
do
they
do
right
or
are
they
just
lucky
in
either
case
this
means
the
average
threat
level
in
this
country
is
rather
low
besides
there
are
other
means
of
selfprotection
which
can
be
just
as
effective
as
firearms
please
name
them
the
key
phrase
is
can
be
theories
are
nice
but
practicality
is
more
important
a
taser
to
chose
an
exmpale
outlawed
virtually
everywhere
can
be
as
effective
as
a
gun
under
optimal
conditions
when
dealing
with
your
absolute
average
i
think
you
have
weapons
on
the
brain
i
never
said
that
these
alternative
means
of
selfprotection
involved
any
hardware
why
are
good
neighborhoods
good
it
isnt
because
every
person
is
armed
to
the
teeth
it
is
because
of
attitude
and
cooperation
in
the
good
neighborhoods
the
residents
make
themselves
aware
of
their
neighbors
and
notice
when
strangers
are
lurking
around
good
neighborhoods
form
groups
like
crimewatch
to
increase
this
effect
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
the
police
when
hostiles
are
arrested
the
good
neighbors
step
up
and
say
thats
the
one
officer
he
was
robbing
mr
jones
house
in
short
the
alternative
to
firepower
is
gangs
or
at
least
a
benificent
manifestation
of
that
social
cooperative
replace
lead
with
flesh
the
flesh
makes
a
better
conversationalist
too
and
you
can
invite
it
over
for
a
block
party
freedoms
and
rights
are
not
dependent
on
public
opinion
necessity
or
scientific
scrutiny
new
to
this
planet
everything
is
dependent
on
either
public
or
political
opinion
usually
political
to
imagine
that
inalienable
rights
are
somehow
wired
into
the
vast
cold
cosmos
is
purest
egotism
and
a
dangerous
delusion
in
a
very
real
sense
everything
the
government
does
is
based
on
public
approval
if
for
no
other
reason
than
at
any
particular
time
there
arent
public
servants
commonly
adorning
trees
but
legality
and
legitimacy
also
matter
if
a
governments
charter
makes
a
rule
which
the
government
then
violates
it
is
violated
the
basis
for
its
existance
enforcement
of
its
will
becomes
a
matter
solely
of
force
of
arms
oliver
north
the
man
is
positively
worshiped
in
many
allamerican
conservative
quarters
he
and
big
ron
setup
a
secret
government
and
did
all
sorts
of
severely
illegal
deeds
the
kind
of
stuff
you
and
i
would
be
doing
twentytolife
for
yet
he
walks
free
this
bs
happens
all
the
time
in
fact
it
happens
so
much
that
no
one
really
cares
anymore
legitimacy
is
a
nonissue
legality
is
a
nonissue
so
long
as
we
get
tbones
and
our
mtv
who
gives
a
rats
ass
no
arguments
against
rkba
can
withstand
scientific
scrutiny
they
dont
have
to
like
so
many
other
things
the
issue
is
one
of
perception
rather
than
boring
statistics
excuse
me
sir
but
you
were
the
one
suggesting
that
arguments
for
rkba
would
not
stand
up
to
scientific
scrutiny
no
i
claimed
that
no
one
is
interested
in
the
statistical
aspects
of
the
argument
pure
emotion
like
the
abortion
issue
every
time
some
young
innocent
is
gunneddown
in
a
drive
by
every
time
some
kid
is
murdered
for
a
jacket
every
time
a
store
clerk
is
executed
for
three
dollars
in
change
every
time
some
moron
kills
his
wife
because
she
took
the
last
beer
from
the
fridge
every
time
someone
hears
a
bang
in
the
night
the
rkba
dies
emotion
is
hard
to
argue
against
but
it
must
be
done
anyway
if
emotion
is
wrong
argue
away
you
cant
win
the
stats
are
not
all
that
clearly
behind
firearms
and
just
yesterday
you
claimed
they
werent
behind
them
at
all
the
protection
factor
does
not
strongly
outweigh
the
mindless
mayhem
factor
operating
under
the
assumption
that
the
same
conditions
absolutely
govern
both
of
them
that
the
expansion
of
one
automatically
necessitates
the
contraction
of
the
other
firearmsrelated
mindless
mayhem
will
be
related
to
the
availibility
of
firearms
if
they
become
scarce
and
and
expensive
a
different
psychology
will
take
hold
i
think
they
would
be
used
far
less
to
settle
trivial
complaints
