subject
re
my
gun
is
like
my
in
article
writes
what
all
you
turkey
propistol
and
automatic
weapons
fanatics
dont
seem
to
realize
is
that
the
rest
of
us
laugh
at
you
you
dont
make
me
angry
you
just
make
me
chuckle
steve
its
nice
that
you
find
me
laughable
but
i
dont
quite
understand
is
it
because
you
think
my
firearms
clash
with
what
im
wearing
or
that
my
nra
sticker
isnt
on
straight
please
state
your
judgement
i
find
it
sad
that
people
wont
accept
the
responsibility
to
defend
themselves
and
i
laugh
with
the
same
contempt
you
have
for
me
at
the
sheep
who
expect
the
government
to
protect
them
what
he
didnt
realize
was
that
we
took
a
photo
of
the
back
of
his
truck
and
showed
it
to
our
friends
when
we
got
back
to
vancouver
canada
where
im
from
originally
people
were
guffawing
at
the
basic
stupidity
of
such
a
sticker
and
the
even
greater
stupidity
of
the
person
who
put
it
there
in
the
first
place
you
and
your
friends
sound
like
a
bunch
of
smug
intellectuals
now
that
i
live
in
britain
i
can
see
how
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
perceives
you
gunnut
morons
oh
i
guess
you
are
im
still
waiting
for
you
allknowing
academiclikes
to
solve
the
worlds
problems
let
us
know
when
you
have
the
answers
or
punch
lines
as
this
case
may
be
the
only
problem
is
that
canada
i
hear
is
suffering
from
your
national
eccentricity
in
that
easy
to
purchase
weapons
are
being
smuggled
cross
the
border
so
its
not
a
yankee
thing
are
canadians
actually
as
uncivilized
as
we
americans
hell
here
in
britain
the
cops
dont
even
carry
guns
well
if
its
anything
like
here
it
wouldnt
matter
if
they
did
they
wouldnt
be
able
to
use
them
hell
as
i
recall
in
peoples
court
even
rusty
carried
a
gun
never
know
some
plaintiff
might
go
nuts
you
shouldnt
waste
your
time
watching
tv
steve
it
will
corrupt
your
mind
anyway
all
you
gun
nut
rush
limbaugh
fans
please
keep
up
your
diatribes
against
brady
and
other
evil
liberal
media
plots
you
re
so
damn
funny
you
provide
endless
amounts
of
entertainment
in
your
arguments
and
examples
of
why
someone
should
be
allowed
to
carry
a
piece
keep
us
all
chuckling
ditto
to
you
self
righteous
one
lay
your
derogatory
tirade
on
thick
steve

keep
laughing
and

keep
feeling
safe
and
secure
steve
