well
they
had
over
days
to
come
out
with
their
hands
up
on
national
tv
to
get
the
trial
they
deserved
instead
they
chose
to
set
fire
to
their
compund
hours
after
the
tanks
dropped
off
the
tear
gas
this
is
about
the
third
person
whos
parroted
the
fbis
line
about
the
fires
being
set
six
hours
after
the
tear
gas
was
injected
suppose
you
want
to
explain
to
us
the
videotape
footage
shown
on
national
tv
last
night
in
which
a
tank
with
the
gasinjecting
tubes
is
pulling
its
injection
tubes
out
of
the
second
story
of
a
building
as
the
building
begins
to
belch
smoke
and
then
fire
ive
already
corrected
my
mistake
earlier
in
this
thread
i
saw
a
brief
news
report
which
led
to
the
above
inaccuracy
i
have
since
seen
detailed
summaries
that
show
the
tanks
returned
in
the
late
morning
so
why
didnt
the
bds
leave
when
the
gas
was
first
introduced
much
earlier
in
the
morning
didnt
they
care
about
the
children
why
didnt
they
release
the
children
weeks
ago
do
tell
joe
