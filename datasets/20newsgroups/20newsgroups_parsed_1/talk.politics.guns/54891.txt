hr
a
gun
law
i
can
live
with
in

bill
meyers
me
writes
a
bill
to
establish
the
right
to
obtain
firearms
for
security
and
to
use
firearms
in
defense
of
self
family
or
home
and
to
provide
for
the
enforcement
of
such
right
in
response
to
which
in
article
chris
bartz
writes
so
you
have
the
right
unless
the
federal
government
says
you
dont
i
dont
think
i
like
this
very
much
and
in

writes
maybe
im
too
religious
but
when
i
see
a
bill
to
establish
a
right
i
wince
keep
in
mind
what
the
law
giveth
the
law
can
taketh
away
and
in
article
aaron
ray
clement
s
writes
right
mentioned
in
the
bill
is
already
established
under
the
second
amendment
the
bill
should
be
reworded
to
reaffirm
the
second
amendment
hey
guys
youre
absolutely
correct
and
well
on
the
way
to
winning
this
battle
and
losing
the
war
yes
there
are
serious
philosophical
flaws
in
hr
technical
ones
too
howd
you
like
to
sue
the
feds
lose
and
have
to
pay
their
reasonable
attorneys
fee
still
i
have
one
basic
question
compared
to
what
weve
got
is
hr
a
better
or
b
worse
this
one
shouldnt
even
take
you
three
guesses
if
theres
a
good
enough
show
of
support
for
hr
maybe
for
a
change
we
could
be
the
ones
saying
its
a
reasonable
first
step
the
nd
amendment
is
about
sovereignty
not
duck
hunting
