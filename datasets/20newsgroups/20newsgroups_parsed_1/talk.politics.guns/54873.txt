i
dont
remember
the
figures
exactly
but
there
were
about
deaths
in
texas
in
that
was
caused
by
guns
that
includes
suicides
since
it
has
been
shown
in
other
countries
that
suicide
rates
are
pretty
much
independent
of
the
means
available
for
doing
oneself
in
studies
include
some
donepublished
in
japan
canada
austria
norway
suicides
ought
not
be
included
in
the
count
if
this
is
done
the
number
of
vehiclerelated
deaths
greatly
exceeds
that
of
firearmsrelated
deaths
in
texas
i
should
not
suffer
because
of
others
certainly
not
we
all
agree
on
this
one
but
we
also
live
in
a
sociaty
and
therefor
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
our
freedom
note
the
why
unless
its
doing
something
that
directly
hurts
someone
else
whats
the
point
otherwise
youd
better
stop
operating
all
motor
vehicles
since
the
price
of
operating
them
greatly
exceeds
the
cost
in
lives
of
firearms
one
state
dont
remember
which
texas
tried
to
impose
a
rule
that
you
could
only
buy
one
gun
each
month
think
you
all
know
what
happened
well
its
been
done
at
least
twice
south
north
carolina
did
it
a
few
years
backand
watched
its
crime
rate
relative
to
the
rest
of
the
country
rise
quite
a
bit
virginia
just
passed
the
lawno
word
yet
on
what
the
results
will
be
but
id
be
willing
ot
bet
that
a
reduction
in
crime
rates
wont
be
one
of
them
i
respect
the
right
to
defend
yourself
but
that
right
should
not
inflict
on
other
people
selfdefense
doesnt
inflict
on
other
people
except
perhaps
the
criminal
whos
tried
to
do
you
damage
and
maybe
indirectly
on
future
potential
victims
who
might
not
become
victims
some
things
are
too
important
not
to
give
away
to
everybody
else
and
have
none
left
for
yourself
