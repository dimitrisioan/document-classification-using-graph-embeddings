oh
then
i
guess
that
shooting
those
kind
of
babies
is
all
right
you
sick
bastard
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
investors
packet
why
thanks
for
your
reply
to
my
post
by
the
way
i
never
never
ever
said
that
it
was
right
to
shoot
those
kind
of
babies
however
it
was
the
branch
davidian
people
in
there
that
insisted
on
staying
there
with
their
savior
yeah
right
budy
boy
because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his
cause
therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the
atfs
who
gave
them
to
days
to
get
out
this
was
days
to
many
for
me
and
for
many
of
the
rest
of
the
us
i
am
however
sad
to
hear
of
the
death
of
any
child
unlike
the
sick
bastard
i
supposedly
