find

keep

dont
patronize

i
wont

you
feel
free
to
patronize
me
all
you
like

need
the
tips
seriously
if
you
were
insulted
i
apologize
the
most
tiresome
thing
about
this
group
is
that
so
many
people
tell
others
they
are
sucking
up
to
the
government
when
ever
they
decide
that
something
the
government
says
is
plausible
and
praise
them
as
independent
thinkers
whenever
they
find
something
the
government
says
implausible
people
are
sucking
up
to
the
government
when
they
decide
that
only
the
things
the
government
says
are
plausible
especially
if
they
refuse
to
consider
reasonable
alternatives
however
from
what
i
saw
plastered
all
over
the
tv
news
last
night
its
no
longer
necessary
to
be
an
independent
thinker
to
depart
from
the
governments
party
line
it
looks
like
our
independent
press
may
actually
be
starting
to
be
earn
its
clothes
allowance
this
to
me
is
a
good
sign
i
hope
it
continues
heres
a
clue
independent
thinkers
are
able
to
come
to
either
conclusion
depending
on
the
circumstances
noncritical
thinkers
are
the
ones
who
would
always
come
to
the
same
type
of
conclusion
regardless
of
the
circumstances
independent
thinkers
question
authority
in
a
situation
where
only
one
set
of
facts
are
being
presented
coming
to
a
conclusion
is
not
the
hallmark
of
an
independent
thinker
unless
its
coupled
with
the
ability
to
challenge
those
facts
critically
the
scientific
method
consists
of
more
than
choosing
the
popular
hypothesis
its
even
more
than
choosing
between
two
hypotheses
that
other
people
have
proposed
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company

write
