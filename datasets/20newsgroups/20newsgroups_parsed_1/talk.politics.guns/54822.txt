thats
another
sad
thing
id
expect
this
sort
of
shit
from
the
batf
but
im
goddamn
disappointed
in
the
fbi
they
used
to
be
professionals
apparently
you
are
unfamiliar
with
the
history
of
the
fbi
you
might
try
looking
up
articles
from

the
us
government
has
become
a
garrotte
around
the
necks
of
its
citizens
just
as
with
a
garrotte
the
more
people
struggle
to
breathe
the
air
of
freedom
the
more
the
government
tightens
its
stranglehold
the
only
possible
outcomes
at
this
point
are
the
death
of
government
or
the
elimination
of
personal
freedom
