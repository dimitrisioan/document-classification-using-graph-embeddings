re
boston
gun
buy
back
from
mark
urbin
rmjust
a
short
thought
when
you
ask
the
question
of
the
authorities
or
sponsors
of
buyback
programs
whether
they
will
check
for
stolen
weapons
and
they
answer
no
its
total
amnesty
please
note
that
the
given
for
each
firearm
in
the
boston
buy
back
will
not
be
in
cash
but
money
orders
how
much
total
amnesty
can
you
get
if
you
leave
paper
trail
behind
in
the
latest
case
in
denver
they
were
giving
away
tickets
to
a
denver
nuggets
basketball
game
how
traceable
is
a
money
order
i
dont
know
havent
used
one
in
years
is
that
even
an
issue
if
the
weapons
arent
checked
for
being
stolen
