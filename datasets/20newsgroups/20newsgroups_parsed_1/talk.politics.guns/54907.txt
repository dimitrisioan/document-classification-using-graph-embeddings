little
in
the
way
of
rationality
could
be
expected
from
koresh
a
selfconfessed
sinner
without
equal
funny
if
koresh
did
say
that
he
was
quoting
st
paul
of
course
the
early
christians
were
persecuted
too
if
koresh
is
a
loony
because
he
quotes
the
bible
how
long
is
it
before
mainstream
christians
become
the
target
of
the
fbis
loving
care
and
attention

get
off

cross
we
need
