newspapers
censoring
gun
advertisements
recently
while
looking
around
in
traders
sporting
goods
store
a
very
well
stocked
firearms
store
i
discovered
a
printed
document
that
was
being
distributed
by
the
good
folks
who
work
there
traders
btw
is
located
in
san
leandro
ca
granted
the
document
may
be
asking
you
and
i
to
help
out
traders
but
in
the
big
scope
of
things
i
feel
that
we
would
do
all
gun
owners
a
favor
by
helping
to
this
cause
anyway
here
it
is
newspaper
ad
censorship
are
you
letting
the
newspapers
tell
you
how
to
live
your
life
whats
good
for
you
whats
not
and
exercise
blatant
censorship
over
what
you
read
in
their
advertisments
the
newspapers
have
now
decided
to
censor
gun
ads
which
is
why
you
no
longer
see
the
ads
that
traders
san
leandro
has
run
for
many
years
these
ads
were
run
for
the
lawabiding
honest
citizens
who
own
firearms
for
sporting
use
or
selfprotection
they
certainly
have
the
right
to
do
so
under
the
second
amendment
right
to
bear
arms
if
you
are
tired
of
newspapers
who
run
sex
and
liquor
ads
galor
yet
refuse
to
run
legitimate
gun
ads
please
send
a
letter
to
the
editors
indicating
your
displeasure
over
their
censorship
doctrine
following
is
a
list
of
bay
area
newspapers
who
censor
gun
ads
perhaps
youd
like
to
send
them
your
thoughts

then
there
are
six
pages
of
facts
i
can
not
validate
these
facts
and
there
were
no
sources
but
many
feel
and
sound
very
true
here
are
the
topic
headlines
big
media
snow
job
blaming
firearms
for
murder
is
like
blaming
hospitals
for
death
i
could
use
the
same
nazi
journalistic
technique
of
cbs
and
abc
to
prove
that
hospitals
cause
death
how
nbc
cbs
and
abc
have
scammed
the
american
people
on
gun
control
american
tv
journalism
is
based
on
nazi
journalism
why
tv
journalists
lie
the
government
with
the
help
of
the
tv
networks
has
succeeded
in
playing
one
group
against
the
other
gun
laws
are
unconstitutional
american
gun
laws
are
based
on
nazi
gun
laws
the
government
is
trying
to
devide
and
conquer
the
cia
wants
your
firearms
and
so
on
for
six
pages
so
now
we
have
the
media
trying
help
put
gun
dealers
out
of
business
by
trying
to
limit
their
exposure
to
potential
customers
and
preventing
the
customers
from
reading
about
sales
of
ammunition
and
firearms
for
sporting
hunting
or
other
recreational
use
let
me
know
