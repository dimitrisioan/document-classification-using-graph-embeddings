re
the
truth
about
waco
in
article
dan
hartung
writes
endless
remarks
of
how
the
davidians
could
have
surrendered
deleted
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
if
they
had
been
quiet
there
would
have
been
no
deaths
i
thought
thier
neighbors
said
that
the
davidians
never
bothered
them
oh
well
that
couldnt
have
been
your
point
then
if
they
hadnt
been
stockpiling
weapons
then
the
atf
wouldnt
have
felt
threatened
and
had
to
move
in
heres
a
newsflash
it
isnt
illegal
to
own
more
than
one
firearm
it
isnt
even
illegal
to
own
lots
of
firearms
they
shot
federales
the
feds
shot
them
too
how
about
that
staying
inside
thing
heres
another
newsflash
sometimes
the
government
does
nasty
things
to
you
that
you
dont
deserve
since
they
were
so
nice
to
the
davidians
the
first
time
round
i
can
see
why
the
davidians
didnt
surrender
so
easily
especially
because
they
were
expecting
the
end
of
the
world
andrew
diederich
these
opinions
are
only
mine
when
they
wave
that
watch
infront
of
my
eyes
