re
batffbi
revenge
in
writes
anyway
heres
how
i
see
the
waco
affair
id
be
interested
in
other
peoples
interpretations
koresh
and
his
people
were
basically
minding
their
own
business
some
weapons
violations
may
have
been
committed
and
i
wouldnt
have
disapproved
of
prosecuting
him
for
those
violations
however
i
think
the
batf
was
criminal
for
starting
negotiations
with
a
military
style
assault
and
for
firing
into
a
house
where
there
were
children
and
other
noncombatants
i
dont
see
they
couldnt
just
leave
a
token
guard
on
the
place
and
wait
the
bds
out
i
dont
approve
of
the
tear
gas
approach
and
if
it
caused
the
fire
to
be
started
i
think
the
fbi
agent
responsible
should
spend
years
in
jail
i
think
the
legal
term
would
be
negligent
homicide
however
if
koreshs
response
to
the
tear
gas
was
to
kill
everyone
there
i
hold
him
largely
responsible
for
their
deaths
well
its
nice
to
see
someone
with
a
brain
a
general
lack
of
paranoia
and
a
willingness
to
put
his
thoughts
in
public
i
tend
to
agree
with
all
you
have
said
never
assume
foul
motives
when
stupidity
will
