that
was
the
entire
point
to
you
what
exactly
did
i
claim
ive
heard
eyewitness
descriptions
of
tanks
using
their
main
guns
to
respond
to
sniper
fire
quite
effectively
i
wasnt
wrong
ive
heard
those
descriptions
if
youre
paying
attention
ive
mentioned
that
i
saw
the
tanks
with
my
own
eyes
but
the
main
gun
firing
was
an
account
i
heard
that
helps
people
judge
whether
or
not
to
kick
in
the
to
use
your
words
bullshit
filters
stating
that
i
claimed
this
is
a
falsehood
later
in
the
same
post
another
part
of
my
memories
was
that
while
most
damaged
building
were
burnt
some
were
in
rubble
based
on
what
i
remember
i
was
and
am
inclined
to
believe
an
old
sarge
or
two
fine
now
you
are
stating
that
you
believe
their
claims
or
that
you
are
inclined
to
see
below
for
a
stronger
statement
of
your
beliefs
those
claims
are
still
ludicrous
however
previously
awesley
had
written
you
can
also
read
of
the
troops
using
grenade
launchers
prompting
me
to
write
to
fire
fragmentary
grenades
i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear
gas
certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
us
believe
they
fired
frags
wouldnt
you
since
it
makes
your
other
claim
seem
more
plausible
to
which
awesley
replied
john
again
strawman
techniques
do
you
feel
youre
losing
it
so
you
have
to
stretch
what
i
said
and
knock
that
down
what
i
read
said
nothing
about
what
they
fired
and
so
i
put
nothing
in
there
if
you
need
some
help
let
me
know
and
il
take
your
side
of
this
for
a
while
youre
not
scoring
here
youre
boring
here
but
why
did
you
mention
grenade
launchers
at
all
because
it
supports
the
notion
that
the
tanks
shelled
buildings
and
it
supports
that
notion
because
it
conjures
images
of
troops
launching
fragmentary
grenades
but
that
too
is
ludicrous
i
wrote
if
tanks
had
fired
their
main
guns
in
detroit
people
would
have
been
screaming
about
it
for
the
past
two
and
half
decades
i
would
know
about
it
awesley
relied
glad
to
know
youre
such
an
expert
nice
to
hear
some
an
authority
i
especially
appreciate
your
basis
of
knowledge
if
it
had
happened
you
would
have
know
it
since
you
are
such
an
authority
you
probably
know
that
people
did
scream
about
an
alleged
massive
coverup
in
the
number
of
people
killed
in
the
detroit
riot
some
claimed
dead
others
said
the
offical
number
is
but
the
concise
columbia
encyclopedia
says
it
was
several
ive
also
heard
some
things
about
that
but
i
wont
dare
repeat
them
youd
assert
that
i
claimed
they
were
truth
yes
if
it
happened
i
would
have
heard
about
it
everybody
would
have
army
tanks
dont
fire
their
cannons
in
american
cities
in
the
s
without
it
becoming
common
knowledge
without
minority
leaders
seizing
on
it
and
condemning
it
over
and
over
again
without
civil
libertarians
saying
this
has
gone
far
enough
so
yes
my
never
hearing
of
it
was
the
basis
for
my
disbelieving
the
claim
now
i
have
more
reasons
to
disbelieve
it
not
one
poster
has
written
to
say
yes
i
lived
in
detroit
at
that
time
and
everybody
knew
that
the
tanks
had
fired
shells
this
is
the
usenet
if
it
had
happened
somebody
here
would
remember
it
furthermore
your
own
research
failed
to
come
up
with
any
support
for
the
claim
the
claim
is
extraordinary
and
it
has
no
supporting
evidence
extraordinary
or
not
unless
you
count
the
brags
of
a
couple
of
guardsmen
shooting
the
shit
i
do
not
i
wrote
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
awesley
wrote
taking
the
tour
after
the
riots
it
was
pretty
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
army
and
guard
troops
or
so
i
recall
from
years
ago
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
was
the
army
running
the
tanks
so
it
would
have
been
an
army
coverup
quibble
fine
it
was
an
army
coverup
six
years
in
the
reserves
has
taught
me
the
difference
also
but
do
you
think
that
in
two
and
half
decades
not
one
guiltridden
participant
has
come
forward
and
said
yes
i
shelled
americans
or
i
gave
the
orders
to
fire
the
cannons
or
i
helped
cover
it
up
i
wrote
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them
awesley
replied
given
the
level
in
destruction
in
detroit
im
quite
willing
to
believe
that
they
did
fire
their
guns
good
then
we
can
drop
the
junk
about
you
not
claiming
that
they
did
your
belief
fails
a
basic
reality
check
why
isnt
it
known
awesley
concludes
now
then
weve
bored
the
shit
out
of
anyone
whose
bothered
to
read
this
far
and
all
youve
managed
to
say
is
that
you
dont
believe
the
account
i
cited
actually
now
we
have
established
that
i
dont
believe
what
you
believe
as
well
as
why
i
dont
believe
it
and
if
its
boring
then
i
yield
the
last
word
to
you
if
you
want
it
you
may
say
anything
you
like
with
impunityi
am
dropping
