noise

doubt
if

let

do
orchestrated

assassination
noise
torture

would
never

the

killed
members
of
the
batf
on
the
first

orchestrated
character
assassination
and
noise
torture
seem
like
a
small
retribution
does
the
phrase
innocent
until
proven
guilty
have
any
meaning
anymore
the
use
of

is
quesionable
