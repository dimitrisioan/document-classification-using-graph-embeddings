look
if
you
can
figure
out
a
reliable
means
of
keeping
guns
away
from
bad
people
while
not
interfering
with
good
people
i
think
wed
all
be
for
it
the
problem
is
the
methods
were
using
now
dont
do
the
trick
dont
manufacture
them
dont
sell
them
dont
import
them
some
guns
will
get
through
but
far
fewer
and
far
less
people
will
die
because
of
them
hunting
weapons
could
be
allowed
of
course
as
long
as
they
are
big
and
bulky
and
require
reloading
after
a
few
shots
how
many
times
can
you
shoot
at
the
same
animal
anyways
one
assumes
they
are
moving
first
of
all
lets
assume
that
you
are
right
that
fewer
guns
would
make
it
in
to
the
country
that
sounds
great
to
those
that
see
guns
as
inherently
evil
except
then
every
one
of
those
guns
would
be
in
the
hands
of
someone
who
obviously
couldnt
care
less
about
following
the
law
after
all
they
got
the
gun
illegally
so
is
more
likely
to
commit
a
crime
with
that
gun
great
then
everyone
with
a
gun
is
likely
to
use
it
in
a
crime
nice
system
now
as
to
reducing
the
number
of
guns
coming
into
society
by
making
it
illegal
to
manufacture
sell
or
import
them
in
this
coutry
let
me
use
a
parallel
for
empiric
evidence
the
amount
of
cocaine
in
this
country
is
far
less
since
its
manufacture
sale
and
importation
was
out
lawwed
if
that
last
statement
is
true
then
perhaps
we
should
consider
your
plan
this
could
also
apply
to
drugs
in
general
plain
