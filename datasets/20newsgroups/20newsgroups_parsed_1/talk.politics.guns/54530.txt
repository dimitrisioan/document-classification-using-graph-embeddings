call
for
help
todays
atrocity
in
waco
has
finally
impelled
me
to
start
working
on
something
ive
been
thinking
about
for
some
time
over
the
last
few
years
i
have
heard
of
one
case
after
another
of
government
running
completely
amok
unfortunately
most
people
are
oblivious
of
the
governments
crimes
and
still
think
of
it
as
their
protector
so
i
intend
to
put
together
what
i
call
the
american
horror
file
a
compilation
of
cases
where
the
american
government
has
run
roughshod
over
the
rights
of
its
citizens
over
the
last
few
years
focusing
especially
on
deaths
and
injuries
resulting
from
noknock
warrants
and
financial
ruin
to
innocents
resulting
from
civil
forfeiture
laws
but
including
any
other
cases
for
which
i
can
find
decent
documentation
i
hope
to
make
people
bloodboiling
arterybursting
redhot
enraged
at
their
government
the
end
result
will
probably
be
a
book
in
electronic
form
ascii
text
and
postscript
files
detailing
the
governments
crimes
of
recent
years
this
book
will
be
distributed
at
cost
and
i
will
encourage
people
to
post
copies
to
bbss
send
copies
on
disk
to
friends
and
print
out
copies
and
give
them
to
neighbors
this
is
a
call
for
your
help
any
information
that
you
can
send
me
on
how
government
is
running
amok
will
be
greatly
appreciated
i
would
prefer
information
that
is
welldocumented
with
sources
given
about
specific
instances
of
governmental
abuses
i
also
welcome
anyone
who
wants
to
join
me
in
collecting
and
researching
information
for
this
project
