the
koreshians
rubbed
themselves
out
neither
mormons
nor
jews
have
a
propensity
for
dousing
themselves
with
kerosene
so
im
not
particularly
concerned
or
shall
we
blame
jim
jones
on
the
government
also
be
thankful
that
the

standoff
at

got
some
of
the
kids
out
before
the
cult
committed
mass
suicide
dont
you
believe
that
the
branch
davidians
committed
suicide
for

would
not
put
it
past
the

they
feed
your
their
story
dont
ever
ever
trust
what
your
wonderful
government
tells
you
janet
reno
and
the
fbi
have
the
murder
of
a
hundred
people
on
their
hands
hope
they
can
sleep
