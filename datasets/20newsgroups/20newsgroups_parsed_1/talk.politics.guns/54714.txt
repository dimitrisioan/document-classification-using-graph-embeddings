i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
murderous
huh
yeah
there
was
all
sorts
of
carnage
going
on
there
in
the
years
they
were
there
before
the
government
assaulted
them
oh
i
forgot
you
probably
consider
selfdefense
as
murder
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
damn
right
this
is
not
a
partisan
thing
its
about
individual
liberties
the
right
of
a
citizen
to
be
left
the
hell
alone
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
thats
another
indication
that
you
dont
understand
the
issue
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that
day
im
eager
to
know
maybe
they
said
our
appropriations
are
coming
up
soon
we
need
a
good
pr
boost
lets
find
a
socially
unpopular
group
who
happen
to
have
a
lot
of
guns
go
in
like
gangbusters
be
heros
and
have
the
local
media
get
it
all
on
video
tape
then
we
wont
have
to
worry
about
our
budget
until
next
year
does
bill
clinton
look
good
in
a
cape
why
dont
you
knit
one
to
match
his
jogging
outfit
