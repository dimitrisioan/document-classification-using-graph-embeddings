fbi
directors
statement
on
waco
standoff
i
had
hoped
to
be
making
a
very
different
statement
this
evening
after
very
careful
planning
and
extensive
preparation
we
all
thought
that
todays
efforts
by
the
fbi
to
bring
the
branch
davidians
out
of
their
compound
would
result
in
the
peaceful
resolution
of
the
standoff
or
at
least
meaningful
negotiation
instead
we
are
faced
with
devastation
and
death
however
i
have
no
question
that
our
plan
was
correct
and
was
conducted
with
extreme
professionalism
and
care
i
applaud
the
restraint
shown
by
agents
in
the
face
of
lifethreatening
gunfire
and
i
thank
them
for
risking
their
lives
to
try
to
end
this
peacefully
i
have
only
the
greatest
admiration
for
the
courage
and
professionalism
of
all
involved
i
have
no
question
that
our
plan
was
correct
months
to
get
ready
unlimited
funds
knowledge
of
a
threatened
mass
suicide
by
fire
and
no
fire
trucks
on
hand
this
is
extreme
professionalism
and
care
i
can
understand
the
first
screwedup
raid
by
the
batf
they
underestimated
the
opposition
which
happens
but
not
this
one
the
fbi
had
their
first
team
in
place
massive
resources
ample
time
for
planning
and
bringing
up
any
specialized
equipment
or
people
necessary
they
still
botched
it
the
fbi
director
and
the
fbi
sac
in
overall
charge
should
resign
or
be
fired
for
incompetence
i
dont
blame
reno
or
clinton
they
gave
the
fbi
clear
orders
dont
go
in
unless
you
can
do
it
without
casualties
if
you
cant
do
that
wait
it
out
those
were
reasonable
orders
the
fbi
said
they
could
pull
off
a
tactical
solution
and
they
couldnt
