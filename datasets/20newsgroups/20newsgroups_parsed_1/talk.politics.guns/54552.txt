the
holocaust
revisited
in
john
bell
dribbles
in
his
nappies
and
manages
to
splutter
you
know
john
if
you
had
kept
the
followup
to
line
here
on
talk
politics
guns
we
might
have
taken
you
a
bit
more
seriously
it
would
have
at
least
implied
that
you
had
some
backbone
perhaps
a
modicum
of
willingness
to
present
your
views
and
support
them
i
guess
we
all
know
better
now
people
dumb
enough
to
give
their
money
and
possessions
to
a
guy
who
says
hes
jesus
deserve
all
they
get
really
thats
interesting
as
i
was
always
of
the
opinion
that
people
dumb
enough
to
keep
a
monarchy
around
and
support
them
with
tax
funds
when
said
monarchy
is
merely
a
figurehead
deserve
all
that
they
get
dunkirk
for
example
what
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
then
enjoy
your
helping
of
foot
anyway
he
killed
a
few
feds
and
they
killed
a
few
people
of
their
own
including
one
child
at
last
report
so
what
being
a
federal
agent
is
not
license
to
kill
then
theres
cnn
indicating
that
the
atffbi
actually
did
start
the
fires
which
would
mean
feds
killed
just
under
people
if
youre
so
hot
to
assign
blame
make
sure
you
dont
overlook
the
obvious
hes
not
the
goddam
hero
here
montgomery
isnt
much
of
a
hero
here
either
amazing
how
different
things
look
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
isnt
it
not
that
what
you
think
makes
much
of
a
difference
in
the
usa
though
and
for
good
reason
when
you
can
vote
ill
take
your
rhetoric
a
bit
more
seriously
right
now
youre
merely
a
waste
of
transatlantic
bandwidth
hes
dead
an
im
happy
proof
positive
that
ignorance
really
is
bliss
