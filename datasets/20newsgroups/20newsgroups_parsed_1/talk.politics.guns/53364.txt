is
it
the
swastika
that
is
bad
just
want
to
back
this
up
with
a
personal
anecdote
my
grandparents
have
a
navajo
rug
made
in
the
s
which
they
received
in
trade
from
the
weaver
while
living
in
flagstaff
arizona
the
decorative
motif
consists
of
large
black
swastikas
one
in
each
corner
whats
more
the
color
scheme
is
black
white
and
red
to
the
casual
glance
it
would
undoubtedly
appear
to
be
a
nazi
relic
of
some
kind
yet
they
owned
it
ten
years
before
hitler
and
the
national
socialists
came
to
power
as
i
recall
they
took
it
down
in
the
s
and
didnt
feel
quite
right
about
putting
it
back
up
until
the
s
it
still
draws
comments
from
those
who
dont
know
what
it
is
