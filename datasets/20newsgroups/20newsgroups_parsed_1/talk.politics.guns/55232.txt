i
saw
this
nifty
drawn
out
posting
and
i
thought
i
might
give
the
two
of
you
a
little
help
with
your
problem
as
you
both
know
what
you
postedand
this
foolish
thing
gave
me
so
much
shit
last
time
i
tried
to
post
i
took
the
liberty
of
deleting
all
but
the
header
and
a
single
quote
i
hope
you
dont
mind
as
written
the
second
ammendment
states
rather
clearly
for
anyone
who
can
read
the
following
a
well
regulated
militia
being
necessarry
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
what
is
regulated
regulated
means
controlled
how
about
security
well
hey
that
would
be
along
the
lines
of
being
and
feeling
safe
wouldnt
it
wow
we
have
a
concept
forming
here
dont
we
now
what
have
we
left
the
right
of
the
people

sorry
got
kinda
hungup
there
shall
not

infringed
oops
backup
therehmmm
infringedthatd
be
like
interfered
with
altered
changed
or
watered
down
in
any
wayshape
or
form
so
what
we
have
here
in
its
big
old
long
winded
version
would
be
a
well
controlled
militia
being
necessary
to
the
securesafe
feeling
of
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
fucked
with
in
any
way
shape
or
form
by
some
happy
ass
good
for
nothing
in
some
piddly
government
building
who
wants
to
run
my
life
in
the
pursuit
of
his
happiness
the
item
is
clear
and
concise
in
its
present
form
my
young
friend
it
does
not
need
my
clarification
or
that
of
any
other
this
is
only
ammendment
which
guarantees
the
continued
existence
of
the
others
its
whole
purpose
is
to
give
people
recourse
against
the
military
machine
of
a
government
which
fails
to
properly
represent
its
creatorsus
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
any
replies
or
comments
can
be

only
thing
we

to
fearis
