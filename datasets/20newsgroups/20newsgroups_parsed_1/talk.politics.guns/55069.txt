writes
how
is
clinton
responsible
it
was
a
law
enforcement
action
granted
it
was
a
nationally
covered
incident
but
clinton
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
outcome
than
fred
flintstone
do
i
think
clinton
conceived
of
it
no
do
i
think
clinton
ordered
it
no
do
i
think
clinton
was
aware
of
it
before
it
went
down
no
do
i
think
clinton
was
aware
of
it
after
it
went
down
of
course
who
wasnt
do
i
think
clinton
prejudged
these
people
to
a
certain
extent
because
he
believed
the
batf
crap
about
child
abuse
and
stockpiling
evil
semiautomatic
weapons
yes
do
i
think
clinton
ever
questioned
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
no
do
i
think
clinton
ever
considered
the
civil
rights
of
the
victims
no
as
for
the
rest
i
wont
argue
whether
batf
handled
the
initial
confrontation
well
or
as
it
should
have
but
from
day
on
i
have
no
problem
with
the
way
the
operation
was
handled
or
the
decisions
made
some
of
us
suspect
that
all
the
unlawful
mistakes
made
on
day
were
made
on
the
governments
end
that
makes
days
nothing
but
a
macho
alternative
to
delivering
an
apology
as
for
day
as
long
as
the
fbi
and
batf
didnt
intentionally
set
the
fire
then
while
it
is
certainly
tragic
the
majority
of
americans
according
to
a
recent
poll
have
no
problems
with
the
operation
itself
who
gives
a
good
goddamn
about
some
bullshit
opinion
poll
of
most
americans
most
americans
swallow
the
government
line
that
theyre
fed
not
because
theyre
stupid
but
because
its
the
only
line
they
ever
hear
most
americans
thought
the
staff
at
the
mcmaster
school
was
guilty
guilty
guilty
woops
turns
out
they
werent
most
americans
once
thought
that
black
slaves
werent
human
beings
woops
wrong
again
most
americans
thought
saddam
hussein
was
the
antichrist
oh
dear
he
was
a
special
friend
of
the
american
government
until
two
years
previously
you
know
maybe
truth
isnt
determined
by
majority
vote
of
a
halfinformed
public
after
all
in
fact
most
americans
according
to
this
poll
think
it
should
have
been
resolved
sooner
youre
just
testy
because
of
all
those
newsbreaks
that
were
interrupting
roseanne
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
