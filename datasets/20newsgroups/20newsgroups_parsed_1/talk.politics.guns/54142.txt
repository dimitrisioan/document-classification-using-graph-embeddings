i
find
it
amazing
that
criminals
often
live
better
than
the
dsrest
of
the
population
in
some
aspects
and
that
were
paying

do
so

you
are
somewhat
in

all
respects
we
are
paying
when
we
are
not
paying
for
their

incarceration
we
are
paying
with
our
lives
and
belongings
as
their
prey
upon
what
would
they
practice
their
nefarious
predatory
acts
if
not
for
the
citizens
of
this
country
what
is
amazing
to
me
is
the
mindset
of
those
who
overtly
and
covertly
perpetuate
a
justice
system
har
that
essentially
mandates
that
some
of
us
offer
up
ourselves
as
that
prey
while
they
