re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
gun
clubs
if
you
are
a
member
you
can
borrow
weaponssuprised
you
are
supposed
to
train
with
a
for
the
months
then
you
can
start
with
anything
bigger
drivers
licence
forgot
that
usa
is
the
land
of
cars
getting
one
in
scandinavia
and
northern
europe
is
not
easy
average
time
is
about
hours
of
training
and
the
cost
is
rather
but
we
think
this
is
acceptable
because
a
car
is
not
a
toy
and
bad
drivers
tend
to
hurt
others
if
you
are
really
bad
you
wont
get
a
lincence
abuse
by
the
goverment
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
main
problems
any
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abused
by
the
goverment
either
some
of
you
are
a
little
paranoid
no
offence
or
you
should
get
a
new
goverment
you
do
have
elections
guns
n
criminals
most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
known
criminals
can
not
buy
weapons
thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
and
because
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europe
we
dont
have
any
problem
with
smuggled
guns
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
someone
said
that
if
we
ban
guns
wed
have
to
ban
cars
to
because
they
kill
to
i
dont
think
we
should
argue
on
this
one
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
dont
flame
the
englishmen
because
of
northern
irland
they
have
gun
control
that
works
in
england
and
fonds
from
usa
are
one
of
the
reasons
why
ira
can
bomb
innocents
something
about
throwing
stones
in
glass
houses
dont
flame
them
because
of
what
to
three
children
did
either
can
an
jugoslav
have
an
oppinion
on
guns
or
even
peace
yes
my
numbers
about
crime
rates
after
restrictions
on
shotguns
are
from
the
police
and
the
statistisk
sentralbyraa
understood
that
one
sorenson
last
word
responsible
gun
owners
are
not
a
problem
but
they
will
be
affected
if
you
want
to
protect
your
citicens
this
is
not
a
signature
its
merely
a

to
waste

bring
down
the
evil
internet
