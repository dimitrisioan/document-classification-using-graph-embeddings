re
ax
the
atf
a
few
comments
on
the
atfs
botched
handling
of
this
case
attempting
to
storm
the
compound
in
broad
daylight
the
explanation
we
were
given
at
least
at
one
point
was
that
they
thought
the
cult
members
would
be
at
religious
services
my
only
comment
on
this
bit
of
idiocy
is
that
if
youre
going
to
operate
as
a
quasimilitary
unit
youd
better
understand
basic
military
tactics
one
cardinal
rule
is
that
only
a
fool
plans
an
operation
where
if
one
assumption
is
incorrect
the
operation
will
fail
disastrously
we
were
told
that
atf
got
four
agents
killed
because
they
were
outgunned
they
didnt
expect
such
heavy
resistance
when
questioned
about
why
such
an
overwhelming
militarystyle
assault
was
planned
we
were
told
that
it
was
because
the
cultists
were
thought
to
be
heavily
armed
can
you
say
contradictory
i
knew
you
could
the
batf
has
had
a
bad
reputation
for
years
as
a
bunch
of
arrogant
hotdoggers
i
was
talking
to
relatives
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
referred
to
them
as
a
bunch
of
crockett
and
tubbs
wannabes
im
more
than
ever
convinced
thats
right
on
target
an
anecdote
not
related
to
the
waco
fiasco
is
that
apparently
the
batf
screwed
up
some
of
the
evidence
in
the
world
trade
center
bombing
theres
now
an
excellent
chance
some
of
the
forensic
evidence
gathered
by
the
fbi
will
not
be
admissible
in
court
this
is
not
hearsay
i
was
told
this
by
a
relative
of
my
wifes
who
happens
to
be
an
fbi
agent
his
opinion
of
the
batf
was
ummm
well
lets
just
say
uncomplimentary
i
have
still
not
been
presented
with
one
iota
of
evidence
that
the
bds
had
any
of
the
alleged
illegal
weaponry
which
was
the
reason
for
the
raid
in
the
first
place
btw
were
still
hearing
this
justification
ag
reno
on
cnn
yesterday
made
references
to
this
issue
without
any
substantiation
she
also
waved
around
the
hes
a
child
abuser
and
we
heard
he
was
beating
the
children
flag
sigh
a
point
re
the
feds
in
general
their
handling
of
the
whole
siege
reflected
a
complete
lack
of
understanding
of
the
probable
thought
processes
of
the
cultists
ag
reno
said
they
pushed
the
button
because
they
were
afraid
a
mass
suicide
was
in
the
offing
my
only
comment
on
that
is
that
if
the
cultists
were
that
close
to
the
edge
what
the
hell
did
she
think
their
reaction
would
be
to
an
hourslong
assault
on
the
compound
where
holes
were
punched
in
the
walls
and
cs
gas
pumped
in
if
i
were
a
bd
id
expect
the
forces
of
the
godless
government
to
assault
me
at
any
time
in
that
light
whether
they
torched
themselves
or
drank
jim
jones
koolaid
is
irrelevant
also
look
at
how
the
siege
was
conducted
bright
lights
loud
rock
music
cutting
off
communications
and
other
contact
with
the
outside
all
measures
designed
to
make
the
bds
feel
more
and
more
isolated
and
threatened
this
might
have
been
a
great
strategy
if
they
were
dealing
with
criminals
as
it
was
it
looks
to
me
like
everything
they
did
fed
into
koreshs
paranoid
delusions
