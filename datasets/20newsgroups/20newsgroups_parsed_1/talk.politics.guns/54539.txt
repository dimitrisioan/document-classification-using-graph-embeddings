the
problem
with
the
fbi
as
a
monolithic
entity
doing
it
is
that
it
requires
everybody
involved
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
while
they
tended
to
behave
like
total
idiots
that
does
not
make
them
homocidal
maniacs
either
and
if
it
was
one
nutcase
agent
then
it
serves
no
purpose
to
blame
the
whole
agency
a
great
deal
of
documentation
exists
on
exactly
that
phenomenon
especially
regarding
vietnam
and
the
mai
lai
sp
massacre
not
that
im
suggesting
that
they
started
it
on
purpose
but
even
if
they
now
know
that
they
accidentally
started
or
contributed
to
it
you
can
be
sure
the
initial
reaction
is
to
lie
remember
the
iranian
airliner
which
the
us
navy
mistook
for
a
fighter

shot
