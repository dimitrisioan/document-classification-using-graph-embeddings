why
didnt
they
release
the
children
weeks
ago
it
would
have
been
inconsistent
behavior
for
them
to
have
done
so
some
people
believe
that
there
is
more
to
life
than
the
physical
requirements
these
folks
believed
that
the
generallyheld
standards
of
the
surrounding
community
heck
most
of
the
world
were
morally
wrong
and
letting
the
children
be
abandoned
to
this
godlessunbelieving
culture
would
be
condeming
them
to
eternal
loss
and
separation
from
god
by
their
standards
letting
the
children
go
would
be
abandoning
them
to
a
fate
literally
worse
than
death
the
fbi
and
batf
and
media
people
working
on
the
issue
i
suspect
just
couldnt
get
their
heads
into
a
similarenough
to
say
nothing
of
identical
mode
of
thinking
to
realize
what
they
were
doing
physically
there
was
no
reason
why
the
bds
shouldnt
have
given
up
and
come
out
a
long
time
ago
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
bds
they
were
up
against
the
wall
and
had
nowhere
to
go
at
all
they
apparently
really
did
love
their
kids
too
much
to
abandon
them
to
a
godless
bunch
of
outsidersalthough
the
end
result
was
horribly
twisted
i
didnt
say
the
bds
were
right
i
just
said
that
thats
the
way
they
perceived
it
koresh
was
a
nutcase
and
a
bunch
of
other
people
paid
for
that
and
the
fbi
and
batf
miscalculated
and
misunderstood
what
was
going
on
from
the
word
go
very
likely
possible
reminds
me
of
the
movie
the
rapture
some
things
are
too
important
not
to
give
away
to
everybody
else
and
have
none
left
for
yourself
