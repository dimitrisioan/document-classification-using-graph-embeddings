carrying

i
have
a
question
about
the
second
amendment
that
has
bothered
me
for
awhile
the
amendment
guarentees
our
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
currently
the
gun
prohibitionists
are
trying
to
restrict
or
eliminate
our
right
to
keep
arms
with
the
brady
bill
and
the
assault
weapon
ban
however
havent
we
already
lost
our
right
to
bear
arms
it
seems
that
in
most
states
like
texas
a
citizen
may
own
a
gun
and
carry
while
at
his
home
or
business
but
a
citizen
is
severely
restricted
from
bearing
outside
these
areas
here
in
texas
you
can
not
carry
in
your
car
except
when
traveling
which
is
usually
defined
as
traveling
across
a
county
line
how
did
this
come
about
are
there
any
court
rulings
on
the
legality
of
restricting
the
carrying
of
a
weapon
outside
the
home
there
are
but
not
any
that
would
help
texans
in
many
states
such
laws
have
been
found
to
violate
the
state
constitution
but
the
federal
second
amendment
does
not
apply
directly
to
the
states
it
was
written
to
limit
the
federal
government
only
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
written
to
extend
the
restrictions
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
state
level
however
the
exact
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
very
vague
the
supreme
court
has
been
dancing
around
the
issue
without
facing
it
directly
for
over
years
in
practice
the
bill
of
right
indirectly
applies
through
the
fourteenth
applies
to
the
state
governments
only
if
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
particular
provision
the
court
has
made
no
such
rulings
on
the
second
amendment
