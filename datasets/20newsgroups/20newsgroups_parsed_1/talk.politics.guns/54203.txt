be
null
and
void

be
delighted
to
hear
your
ranting
and
raving
however
clinton
has
not
publically
stated
that
he
would
like
to
repeal
the
second

tough
titty
to
you
you

the
number
of
cases
of
firearms
abuses
has
ruined
your

there
is
nothing

dream
about
with

millions
of
unregistered
handguns
new
york
city
by
the
way
has
a
very
high
crime
rate
perhaps
you
should
know
about
a
gungrabbers
nightmare
idaho
here
in
idaho
the
police
give
concealed
carry
permits
to
anyone
over
without
a
criminal
record
there
are
no
gungrabber
schemes
such
as
foids
waiting
periods
gun
a
month
or
ltcs
and
horror
of
horrors
you
dont
even
need
a
permit
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
while
outside
of
city
limits
although
you
do
need
a
permit
for
concealed
carry
in
an
automobile
i
feel
a
hell
of
a
lot
safer
in
boise
than
i
would
in
your
gun
ban
dream
state
eg
washington
dc
the
press
is
against
you
the
public
the
voting
public
is
against
you
the
flow
of
history
is
against
you
this
is
it

staunchly
progun

your
arms

enough
officers
will
be
around
to
collect
them
resistance
is
useless
they
will
overwhelm
you
one
at
a
time
your
neighbors
will
not
help
you
they
will
consider
you
more
if
an
immediate
threat
than
the
abstract
criminal
get
out
your
wallet
and
buy
another
clue
there
are
millions
upon
millions
of
pre
ie
noned
firearms

a
halflife
approaching
eternity

way
of
the
kkk
violent
