failed
to
mention
the
davidians
pouring
kerosene
all
over
and
lighting
it
in
plain
view
brent
im
still
waiting
to
see
if
there
are
any
evidence
of
how
the
fire
got
started
so
im
not
going
to
tell
you
who
did
it
as
far
as
you
keep
talking
about
the
davidians
pouring
kerosene
all
over
stop
and
think
for
a
second
if
it
is
possible
the
stove
or
lamp
was
knocked
over
and
started
a
fire
and
the
davidians
were
pouring
water
on
it
wrong
solution
but
i
doubt
i
can
do
much
better
in
their
states
of
mind
to
try
to
put
it
out
by
the
way
just
how
far
where
you
standing
from
the
davidians
when
you
saw
them
setting
the
place
on
fire
oh
in
case
you
are
new
in
town
microwave
ovens
doesnt
work
very
well
when
theres
no
electricty
get
some
facts
before
you
post
next
time
