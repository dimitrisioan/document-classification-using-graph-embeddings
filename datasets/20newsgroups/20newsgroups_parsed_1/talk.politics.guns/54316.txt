reasonable
civie
arms
limits
in
article
writes
a
poster
claims
he
always
asks
antigunners
what
they
think
would
be
reasonable
personal
firepower
restrictions
ok
then
caliber
not
greater
than
muzzle
not
greater
than
ftlbs
with
any
combo
of
bullet
wtvel
action
single
shot
rifles
and
single
action
revolvers
revolvers
bearing
no
more
than
six
rounds
and
incorporating
an
antifanning
mechanism
to
discourage
roy
rogers
wannabes
bullets
any
nonexplosive
variety
hps
just
fine
now
these
specs
leave
the
hr
magnum
as
about
the
most
powerful
allowable
civie
cartridge
for
handgun
or
rifle
use
it
would
be
reasonably
effective
against
home
intruders
muggers
rabid
wolves
and
other
such
nasties
even
with
the
firearmtype
limitations
at
the
same
time
this
caliberpower
limit
would
reduce
the
ultimate
lethality
of
hits
the
chances
of
the
average
joe
encountering
a
gang
of
huge
individuals
all
drunk
and
stoned
on
pcp
and
crystal
meth
and
with
a
bad
attitude
and
all
armed
and
willing
to
die
well
its
about
zero
far
less
than
the
chances
of
getting
killed
driving
your
car
when
will
you
people
realize
that
our
right
to
keep
and
bear
isnt
primarily
intended
to
be
for
protecting
against
criminals
and
beasties
in
the
wild
granted
it
is
a
big
part
but
we
also
need
military
style
weapons
so
we
can
fight
off
the
government
when
they
come
to
our
door
when
ten
agents
come
to
my
door
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
shoot
all
of
them
for
not
upholding
the
constitution
to
the
best
of
their
ability
it
will
be
a
lot
harder
doing
that
with
the
puny
weapons
you
listed
above
please
read
the
federalist
papers
for
all
clarification
on
rkba
these
documents
have
cleared
up
plenty
of
misnomers
that
friends
of
mine
have
had
