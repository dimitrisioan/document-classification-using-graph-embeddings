need
info
on
and
suicide
for
refutation
the
following
is
quoted
from
the
tail
end
of
a
rather
condescending
article
about
paxton
quigley
that
appeared
in
us
snooze
and
world
lies
sorry
i
think
it
was
in
the
wall
street
journal
and
was
repeated
in
the
colorado
peoples
daily
a
student
newspaper
at
the
university
of
colorado
at
boulder
a
study
of
residential
gunsot
deaths
in
king
county
wash
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
studies
by
the
western
psychiatric
institute
in
pittsburgh
found
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
home
sharply
incresases
the
likelihood
a
family
member
will
commit
suicide
even
in
the
absence
of
psychiatric
illness
i
have
seen
these
numbers
quoted
before
and
i
have
seen
very
specific
refutation
of
them
quoted
as
well
if
someone
will
be
so
kind
as
to
email
the
relevant
information
i
will
write
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
co
daily
which
might
get
published
and
send
a
copy
to
usnwr
as
well
thanx
dan

liberty
or
