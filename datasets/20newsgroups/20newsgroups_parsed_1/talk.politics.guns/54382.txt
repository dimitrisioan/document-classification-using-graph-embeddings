i
have
believed
all
along
that
they
could
not
let
them
live
the
embarrassment
to
the
batf
and
the
fbi
wouldve
been
too
severe
remember
this
was
a
suspicion
of
taxevasion
warrant
there
were
no
witnesses
except
the
fbi
all
information
filtered
through
the
fbi
all
they
had
to
do
was
allow
one
remote
controlled
pool
camera
be
installed
near
the
building
and
the
press
couldve
done
their
job
and
wouldve
been
able
to
back
the
fbis
story
with
close
up
video
while
incurring
no
risk
to
the
press
unless
they
did
not
want
the
public
to
see
something
the
complete
lack
of
any
other
source
of
information
other
than
the
fbi
really
causes
me
concern
sick
to
my
stomach
and
getting
sicker
from
all
the
government
apologists
well
put
jim
i
am
as
concerned
about
the
medias
complicity
in
this
growing
coverup
can
you
imagine
the
media
outrage
the
lawsuits
the
investigations
that
would
emit
if
the
government
kept
the
media
away
from
any
other
story
particularly
if
a
republican
administration
had
been
behind
it
whats
going
on
here
lets
look
beyond
the
initial
blunder
and
examine
what
happened
next
im
a
student
of
human
phychology
particularly
in
the
area
of
psyops
because
ive
found
some
of
the
techniques
to
be
useful
in
business
negotiations
that
puts
me
firmly
in
the
amateur
ranks
this
amateur
knows
that
the
first
thing
to
do
when
sizing
up
the
opponent
is
to
do
a
psychological
profile
on
him
you
can
bet
your
ass
the
fbi
had
professionally
done
profiles
on
koresh
koreshs
behavior
was
emminently
predictable
it
is
typical
of
people
who
move
away
from
civilization
to
be
willing
to
fight
to
the
death
to
preserve
their
isolation
it
would
also
be
typical
given
koreshs
religious
orientation
for
such
an
individual
to
interpret
a
government
assault
as
the
apocalypse
suicide
is
as
an
acceptable
alternative
to
being
consumed
in
the
apocalypse
imho
the
fbi
knew
all
this
and
decided
after
days
of
concentrated
psyops
to
initiate
that
apocalypse
i
believe
they
chose
a
course
of
action
designed
specifically
to
push
koresh
over
the
edge
while
publicly
appearing
to
be
acting
reasonably
they
knew
that
koresh
considered
the
tanks
to
be
the
chariots
of
fire
mentioned
in
the
book
of
revelations
they
knew
that
sending
tanks
oops
combat
engineering
vehicles
obstensibly
to
perform
gas
insertions
love
that
newspeak
would
push
him
over
the
edge
look
at
some
supporting
evidence
koreshs
attorney
mentioned
on
tv
earlier
today
that
one
of
koreshs
major
concern
was
the
biblical
role
of
the
tanks
stationed
around
the
compound
the
fbi
through
reno
on
larry
king
last
night
and
at
the
news
conference
this
morning
claimed
to
have
listening
devices
in
the
compound
if
that
was
true
they
knew
their
actions
were
driving
him
to
the
brink
they
knew
they
were
pushing
the
davidians
toward
mass
suicide
any
rational
and
reasonable
agency
not
interested
in
killing
those
people
would
at
the
first
sign
of
preparations
for
suicide
have
pulled
completely
back
and
would
have
gotten
rid
of
all
the
armor
instead
they
continued
with
the
gas
insertion
right
up
to
the
point
where
flames
appeared
the
image
that
will
remain
etched
in
my
mind
is
that
of
the
tank
strutting
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
burning
compound
gloating
over
the
kill
lets
step
back
and
assess
how
this
thing
could
have
been
ended
without
bloodshed
this
technique
would
have
required
a
law
enforcement
agency
interested
in
constitutionally
enforcing
the
law
and
in
the
preservation
of
life
instead
of
achieving
a
military
victory
and
of
vengence
the
way
to
have
nabbed
koresh
was
simply
to
have
announced
a
pull
back
abandoned
the
assault
torn
down
the
concertina
wire
and
removed
the
armor
maintained
covert
surveillance
of
the
compound
and
then
exploited
his
ego
to
flush
him
out
exploiting
his
ego
would
have
been
simple
a
simple
invite
or
two
from
the
tabloid
talk
shows
to
come
on
tv
and
tell
how
he
whipped
the
us
government
would
have
been
something
he
could
not
have
resisted
he
could
have
then
been
nabbed
when
he
left
the
compound
simple
clean
and
safe
but
because
it
would
have
required
the
fbi
to
execute
a
tactical
retreat
and
would
have
deprived
them
of
the
revenge
they
sought
it
was
totally
out
of
the
question
not
without
all
that
testesterone
floating
around
after
all
jannet
reno
had
to
show
the
world
how
big
her
balls
are
yesterday
was
a
sad
sad
day
for
the
