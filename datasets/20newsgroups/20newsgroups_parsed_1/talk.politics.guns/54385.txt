are
we
also
forgetting
the
near
genocide
of
the
native
american
for
the
barbaric
act
of
being
heathen
ie
a
nonchristian
by
a
predominantly
christian
government
thats
a
little
over
years
as
i
recall
id
say
that
for
the
most
part
it
was
religious
persecution
their
religion
dictated
their
lifestyle
this
is
a
stretch
in
fact
a
great
many
of
the
persecuted
indians
were
christian
a
great
many
it
would
be
simpler
to
state
the
obvious
that
white
people
wanted
land
the
indians
dominated
or
threatened
i
really
dont
think
the
government
cared
a
hill
of
beans
about
the
indians
religion
my
native
american
girlfriend
asks
if
the
government
really
doesnt
care
a
hill
of
beans
about
our
religion
how
come
theyre
still
busting
us
for
it
in
oregon
washington
and
a
few
other
places
youd
be
a
christian
too
if
the
us
army
marched
you
into
church
at
gunpoint
