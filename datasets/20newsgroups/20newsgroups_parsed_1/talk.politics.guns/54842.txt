slick
rushie
tries
to
have
it
both
ways
again
today
rush
was
criticizing
clinton
for
not
claiming
responsibility
for
the
actions
and
decisions
of
janet
reno
and
the
fbi
early
enough
to
suit
rush
about
months
ago
rush
was
chortling
over
the
fact
that
reagan
has
stumped
special
persecutor
walsh
with
his
croaking
of
i
dont
remember
when
asked
about
ollie
north
if
rushs
criticism
of
clinton
were
to
be
applied
to
reagan
and
north
reagan
would
have
been
impeached
while
north
was
convicted
and
overturned
on
a
technicality
gosh
rush
sure
wants
to
have
it
both
ways
clinton
must
be
held
responsible
but
reagan
was
clever
by
using
the
amnesia
defense
maybe
thats
waht
clinton
should
say
about
campaign
promises
and
such
well
there
you
go
again
rush
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
wasnt
in
the
loop
and
i
just
dont
remember
