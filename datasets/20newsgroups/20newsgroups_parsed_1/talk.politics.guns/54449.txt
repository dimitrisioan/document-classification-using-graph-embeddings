subject
apology
was
luser
i
was
shocked
to
see
that
the
subject
of
my
last
rely
to
awesley
was
luser
that
was
certainly
not
my
intention
i
meant
to
leave
the
subject
line
unchanged
i
believe
that
the
nntp
server
i
use
at
columbia
must
have
put
in
that
subject
line
in
protest
over
problems
with
my
header
that
was
rather
rude
of
them
but
beggars
cant
be
choosers
i
suppose
in
any
case
i
didnt
do
it
and
i
apologize
to
awesley
for
the
apparent
insult
