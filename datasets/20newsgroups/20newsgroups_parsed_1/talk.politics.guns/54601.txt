yeah
as
information
trickles
in
funny
how
that
works
funny
yeah
funny
how
you
didnt
wait
for
the
fbi
spokesdroid
latest
reversal
of
facts
before
proclaiming
the
bds
burned
themselves
to
death
if
you
wont
believe
anything
the
government
says
and
the
press
is
not
reliable
according
to
the
same
logic
then
what
do
you
base
your
statements
on
wild
speculation
laced
with
a
healthy
dose
of
paranoia
then
post
what
the
press
has
said
not
what
you
wished
they
said
the
medical
examiner
has
refuted
the
fbi
facts
and
if
you
dont
believe
someone
who
has
a
lot
more
reason
to
be
impartial
then
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
are
you
a
moron
or
just
illiterate
the
facts
that
the
fbi
neither
i
was
willing
to
grant
this
for
sake
or
argument
until
i
read
the
following
proclaimed
on
monday
suddenly
werent
facts
anymore
by
the
tuesday
press
conference
you
dont
have
to
pay
attention
to
any
one
source
neither
do
you
have
to
abandon
your
critical
thinking
but
to
disregard
all
sources
of
information
as
lies
and
distortions
and
substitute
your
own
pet
theories
is
more
likely
to
get
you
wild
untruths
than
by
basing
your
theories
on
the
facts
as
they
are
reported
by
the
media
and
the
government
the
facts
as
reported
by
the
press
and
impartial
government
sources
support
me
there
has
beed
no
evidence
of
anyone
setting
the
fire
deliberately
you
simpleton
so
actually
there
was
evidence
of
the
fire
being
set
deliberately
both
testamony
by
the
survivors
and
ir
tape
showing
the
fire
being
set
in
places
and
the
petrochemical
soot
that
the
fire
was
giving
off
indications
of
kerosine
or
gasoline
feeding
the
fire
there
is
no
testimony
at
the
press
conference
the
fbi
said
they
had
no
testimony
the
survivors
as
reported
by
cnn
and
newsday
wire
service
said
that
all
the
survivors
gave
consistent
stories
refuting
the
fbi
they
were
lighting
and
heating
with
kerosine
are
you
trying
to
prove
youre
an
idiot
you
might
not
believe
or
if
you
are
totally
paranoid
or
very
skeptical
but
my
rd
point
is
visible
to
anyone
who
watches
the
tapes
of
the
fire
and
has
started
a
bbq
grill
what
are
you
basing
your
statements
on
oh
i
forgot
youre
the
guy
that
doesnt
know
microwave
oven
need
electricity
never
mind
ho
ho
ho
i
listen
to
npr
watch
cnn
nbc
i
also
read
the
papers
where
do
you
get
yours
then
open
your
eyes
and
ears
at
least
of
those
sources
have
reported
your
full
of
shit
personal
opinions
why
brent
irvine
yes
what
did
you
think
they
were
wayne
