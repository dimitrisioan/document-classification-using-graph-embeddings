prescod
drugs
are
banned
please
tell
me
when
this
supply
will
dry
up
drugs
are
easier
to
manufacture
easier
to
smuggle
easier
to
hide
no
comparison
then
lets
use
another
examplealcoholic
beverages
bottles
of
whiskey
are
larger
heavier
and
more
fragile
than
bags
of
drugs
barrels
and
kegs
are
larger
and
heavier
still
and
are
difficult
to
manipulate
yet
a
lot
of
people
managed
to
get
very
rich
off
of
the
smuggling
of
booze
into
this
country
during
the
years
of
prohibition
there
was
a
demand
so
an
entire
industry
formed
to
supply
it
i
beleive
this
was
the
source
of
the
kennedy
clans
money
so
unless
theres
something
im
missing
i
think
your
argument
that
guns
wont
be
smuggled
because
theyre
more
difficult
to
manufacture
smuggle
and
hide
wont
wash
if
enough
people
want
something
somebody
will
try
to
supply
it
