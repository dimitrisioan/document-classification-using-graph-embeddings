wasnt
she
the
one
making
the
comment
in
about
george
being
born
with
a
silver
foot
in
his
mouth
sounds
like
another
damn
politician
to
me
aint
like
the
old
days
in
texas
anymore
the
politicians
may
have
been
corrupt
then
but
at
least
theyd
take
a
stand
my
apologies
to
a
few
exceptions
i
can
think
of
news
now
is
that
the
house
may
already
have
a
twothirds
majority
so
her
opposition
out
of
her
concern
for
image
shes
even
said
this
publicly
may
not
matter
do
people
expect
the
texans
congressmen
to
act
as
the
nj
republicans
