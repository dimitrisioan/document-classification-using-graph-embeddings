yea
there
are
millions
of
cases
where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter
criminals
alas
this
is
not
provable
not
provable
its
about
as
provable
as
the
number
of
votes
vast
for
bill
clinton
in
the
last
election
if
you
accept
the
information
available
you
can
prove
one
way
or
the
other
if
you
refuse
to
accept
it
nothing
is
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
fine
support
your
assertation
but
you
havent
supported
any
assertations
just
yet
the
national
crime
survey
that
secret
arm
of
the
nra
estimates
between
and
withgun
selfdefenses
from
assaults
and
is
considered
to
considerably
underreport
when
broken
down
by
weapon
there
is
no
form
of
selfdefense
including
dowing
nothing
which
is
more
effective
at
avoiding
injury
or
death
the
bulk
of
firarems
are
used
against
unworthy
and
unnesessary
opponents
those
who
posessa
a
cool
jakcet
you
want
those
who
would
argue
with
you
about
a
parking
space
those
who
would
take
your
woman
in
short
trivial
and
worthless
causes
ok
support
this
assertation
hell
support
one
too
much
of
this
has
ruined
you
cause
there
is
no
recovery
thats
nice
in
the
near
future
federal
martials
will
come
for
your
arms
thats
nice
too
the
nd
amendment
is
dead
accept
this
find
another
way
why
on
earth
should
we
if
youre
correct
weve
nothing
to
lose
by
continuing
to
argue
against
it
and
everything
to
gain
