i
admit
i
cant
cite
a
specific
but
if
there
isnt
a
law
against
purchasing
grenade
components
and
assembling
them
into
functioning
units
then
perhaps
we
need
one
all
second
ammendment
arguments
aside
im
just
not
sure
that
i
like
the
idea
of
private
citizens
with
hand
grenades
are
you
aware
you
can
make
a
grenade
with
gunpower
and
metal
water
pipes
maybe
we
should
outlaw
hardware
stores
and
ammo
reloading
are
you
aware
that
you
can
make
a
firebomb
with
gasoline
etc
