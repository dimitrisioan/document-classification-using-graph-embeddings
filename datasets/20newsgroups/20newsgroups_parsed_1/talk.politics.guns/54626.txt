david
koreshs
lawyer
seemed
to
think
that
everyone
would
come
out
peacefully
sooner
or
later
the
fbi
and
atf
had
nothing
but
time
on
their
hands
why
did
they
have
to
escalate
the
situation
and
cause
this
senseless
tragedy
their
job
is
to
protect
the
public
and
save
lives
not
kill
people
for
crying
out
loud
koresh
had
lied
and
lied
and
lied
about
coming
out
of
the
compound
to
the
fbi
to
his
lawyer
to
just
about
everyone
i
keep
hearing
this
but
every
assertion
of
this
form
has
come
from
government
sources
except
two
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
not
ready
to
stipulate
that
koresh
ever
promised
to
come
out
except
for
his
first
promise
and
his
last
promise
the
first
promise
was
conditional
on
his
audio
tape
being
given
national
exposure
well
it
never
was
it
was
broadcast
locally
in
a
choppedup
fashion
and
thats
all
and
even
then
they
cleverly
cut
it
off
when
it
got
to
the
part
where
he
demanded
national
exposure
but
not
so
cleverly
that
we
didnt
hear
it
the
last
promise
was
conditional
on
the
finishing
of
his
manuscript
well
never
know
if
he
would
have
kept
that
one
the
fbi
etc
cant
wait
forever
for
koresh
to
come
out
as
long
as
they
thought
that
koreshs
intended
to
surrender
peacefully
when
they
lost
hope
in
that
they
decided
to
go
in
strangely
enough
the
previous
day
they
said
they
were
prepared
to
wait
as
long
as
it
takes
further
while
the
mondays
tactics
were
silly
and
clumsy
they
were
obviously
intended
to
drive
the
davidians
out
of
the
compound
not
to
kill
koresh
and
his
followers
quite
possible
but
arguments
of
intent
do
not
mark
the
dividing
line
between
guilt
and
innocence
only
the
line
between
murder
and
negligent
manslaughter
if
it
is
true
i
read
in
the
paper
that
the
government
listening
devices
inside
the
compound
picked
up
orders
to
burn
the
joint
down
shortly
before
the
fire
was
started
im
waiting
to
see
what
the
tapes
really
hold
this
would
be
an
interesting
development
the
davidian
may
be
telling
the
truth
or
he
may
be
lying
to
save
his
skin
from
possible
murder
charges
resulting
from
the
blaze
koreshs
lawyer
being
the
attorney
for
at
least
one
surviving
davidian
has
an
interest
in
claiming
that
the
govt
caused
the
fire
at
least
as
much
as
the
govt
has
an
interest
in
blaming
koresh
for
the
fire
its
the
physical
evidence
that
will
decide
whos
telling
what
its
too
tempting
for
one
or
more
of
the
survivors
to
go
states
evidence
parrot
the
fbi
story
hang
the
whole
suicide
on
koresh
claim
they
only
stayed
at
gunpoint
etc
if
any
of
them
do
this
in
the
next
few
weeks
it
doesnt
prove
much
but
if
none
of
them
do
it
would
be
a
strong
indication
to
me
that
the
fbi
story
is
dead
wrong
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
investors
