re
proper
gun
control
what
is
proper
gun
control
in
la
the
first
recorded
survivor
of
a
shot
to
the
heart
that
lady
not
only
killed
her
attacker
but
chased
him
down
to
do
it
all
four
of
her
shots
fired
after
she
had
been
shot
struck
the
perp
atta
girl
the
bullet
entered
her
on
a
downward
angle
went
through
the
apex
of
her
heart
down
through
the
diaphragm
clipped
her
liver
and
destroyed
her
spleen
it
then
exited
her
back
leaving
a
tennis
ball
sized
hole
she
died
about
six
times
on
the
operating
table
but
was
out
of
the
hospital
in
days
and
was
back
on
full
duty
in
eight
months
she
was
off
duty
at
the
time
and
not
wearing
her
vest
she
was
on
her
way
home
so
happened
to
have
her
gun
no
she
doesnt
think
civilians
should
have
the
same
rights
sigh
well
if
police
think
they
are
so
special
that
only
they
are
worthy
of
selfdefense
perhaps
we
start
putting
the
arm
on
police
maybe
we
should
start
demanding
that
police
are
only
police
when
onduty
that
after
that
they
are
just
like
the
ordinary
disarmed
helpless
chumps
they
consider
civilians
lets
prohibit
arms
carrying
by
police
when
offduty
or
if
they
make
the
assertion
that
well
i
need
to
maintain
my
gun
lets
make
it
regulation
that
they
can
carry
an
unloaded
firearm
home
that
its
only
fair
that
they
be
just
as
helpless
as
poor
schmuck
coming
home
from
his
computer
operator
job
nra
directorexsan
jose
cop
leroy
pyle
states
in
the
latest
swat
magazine
that
anticops
better
watch
out
for
this
schism
between
rkba
folks
and
the
police
he
asks
the
rhetorical
question
of
what
if
whats
left
of
the
gun
lobby
starts
demanding
the
disarmament
of
the
police
well
i
guess
antigun
cops
who
think
only
they
should
be
armed
along
with
the
wealthy
and
politically
connected
should
be
made
to
realize
that
screwing
can
cut
in
ways
they
have
yet
to
imagine
