subject
letter
to
the
president
heres
a
copy
of
a
letter
im
emailing
to
the
slickster
at
his
address
of
to
william
j
clinton
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
mr
president
i
am
writing
to
express
my
utter
outrage
at
the
conduct
of
various
government
agencies
in
regards
to
the
tragedy
in
waco
i
demand
the
dismissal
or
resignation
of
lloyd
bensen
secretary
of
the
treasury
who
bears
responsibility
for
the
initial
helicopter
and
grenade
attack
by
the
atf
against
the
branch
davidians
and
of
janet
reno
who
authorized
the
final
assault
on
the
very
day
that
we
were
commemorating
the
warsaw
ghetto
revolt
and
i
would
truly
appreciate
it
if
you
would
make
sure
something
like
this
never
happens
again
on
your
watch
respectfully
yours
kenneth
d
whitehead
get
involved
gang
its
your
republic
lets
take
it
back
i
will
be
much
more
willing
to
believe
the
governments
side
of
the
waco
story
after
we
are
allowed
to
hear
from
the
survivors
so
far
all
weve
gotten
has
been
censored
by
the
very
people
who
have
the
most
to
cover
up
and
id
really
like
to
know
how
they
got
the
press
who
complained
so
loudly
about
being
kept
off
the
front
lines
during
the
gulf
war
be
such
obedient
lap
dogs
in
waco
kind
of
makes
me
wonder
if
this
socalled
freedom
of
the
press
isnt
highly
overrated
