women
stand
up
for
your
right
to
be
just
as
stupid
as
men
our
new
attorney
general
seems
determined
to
do
so
in
the
past
few
days
she
has
said
she
hopes
the
king
beating
will
not
reduce
public
confidince
in
law
enforcement
the
tactics
of
using
tear
gas
and
driving
tanks
through
walls
in
waco
were
intended
to
further
a
peacefull
solution
to
the
crisis
those
same
tactics
were
intended
to
prevent
a
mass
suicide
but
she
never
expected
the
sect
to
react
by
killing
themselves
its
comforting
to
know
at
least
that
she
wasnt
