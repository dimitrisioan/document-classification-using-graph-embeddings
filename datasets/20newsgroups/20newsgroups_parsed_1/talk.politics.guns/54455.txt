mere
presence
of
a
firearm
without
a
shot
being
fired
prevents
crime
in
many
instances
as
shown
by
news
reports
sent
to
the
armed
citizen
perhaps
so
but
note
that
of
the
accounts
cited
there
was
only
one
in
which
no
shot
was
fired
of
the
other
twelve
five
described
cases
in
which
the
assailant
was
wounded
by
a
shot
and
six
described
cases
in
which
the
assailant
was
killed
by
a
shot
and
had
not
these
citizens
accepted
the
moral
responsibility
to
protect
their
own
lives
there
could
well
have
been
at
least
innocent
victims
lying
dead
and
several
criminals
still
out
walking
the
streets
perpetrating
their
crimes
on
others
