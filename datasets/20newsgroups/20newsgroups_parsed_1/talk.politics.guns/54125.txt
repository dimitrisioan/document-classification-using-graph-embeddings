how
effective
are
personal
defense
products
like
mace
pepperspray
tasers
and
other
nonlethal
stun
devices
compared
to
handguns
any
statistics
on
s
and
types
in
use
these
products
seem
very
attractive
compared
to
handguns
because
being
nonlethal
they
are
more
forgiving
of
accident
or
mistakeswrongful
shooting
such
as
the
yoshi
hattori
case
and
allow
the
justice
system
to
deal
with
the
criminal
rather
than
criminals
simply
being
dead
which
has
a
certain
vigilante
feel
which
seems
to
bother
antigun
people
the
more
forgiving
nature
also
has
its
down
side
it
allows
a
criminal
to
use
them
wo
the
adw
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
charge
they
also
can
have
lethal
or
dangerous
side
effects
some
people
have
violent
reactions
to
macepepper
sprays
stun
guns
can
harm
people
with
weak
hearts
people
have
suffered
eye
damage
from
mace
the
stuff
that
is
available
now
is
less
concentrated
than
it
used
to
be
some
of
the
spray
propellents
are
flammable
the
arguments
i
see
against
these
nonlethal
weapons
compared
to
handguns
are
lack
of
range
lack
of
stopping
power
or
effectiveness
and
limited
ammo
true
how
about
cost
sprays
using
any
of
the
spray
based
eg
mace
pepper
indoors
is
bound
to
affect
anyone
else
in
the
room
like
the
victim
due
to
the
nature
of
the
stuff
using
the
sprays
outdoors
in
any
sort
of
breeze
mitigates
its
effectiveness
from
reading
various
articles
it
appears
that
mace
especially
the
mace
available
to
citizens
is
pretty
ineffective
on
people
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol
pepper
spray
appears
to
be
more
effective
but
has
the
inherent
spray
delivery
problem
it
still
does
not
appear
to
be
anything
better
than
a
distraction
that
might
buy
you
time
to
run
like
hell
if
you
can
consider
that
running
like
hell
isnt
always
a
viable
solution
for
example
if
you
are
dressed
in
boots
and
the
assailent
is
dressed
in
sneakers
you
might
have
a
tough
time
outrunning
them
tasars
and
stun
guns
require
contact
with
skin
for
max
effectiveness
a
jacket
like
a
leather
one
will
mitigate
its
effectiveness
the
user
must
be
extremely
close
to
the
assailent
that
puts
them
at
a
considerable
risk
of
injury
the
user
must
keep
the
stun
gun
in
contact
with
the
assailent
for
some
non
negligible
period
of
time
tasar
darts
can
be
pulled
out
consider
the
problem
a
small
women
would
have
keeping
a
stun
gun
in
contact
with
a
average
size
man
for
any
length
of
time
wo
sustaining
serious
injury
have
any
antigun
groups
suggested
nonlethal
weapons
to
counter
the
progun
argument
that
people
will
be
left
defenseless
i
havent
heard
of
any
generally
they
contend
that
people
dont
need
to
or
arent
able
to
defend
themselves
and
what
legal
restrictionslicensing
apply
to
nonlethal
devices
civilian
ownership
of
stun
guns
is
frequently
illegal
ny
the
sprays
are
also
illegal
in
some
states
believe
it
or
not
they
are
still
illegal
in
ny
although
about
half
the
state
thinks
they
are
legal
i
believe
that
ny
almost
legalized
them
i
have
heard
that
the
reason
they
didnt
was
due
to
their
ineffectiveness
i
feel
that
the
sprays
are
better
than
nothing
but
only
if
the
user
does
not
believe
the
hype
thisll
drop
em
in
their
tracks
stuff
and
uses
it
as
a
diversion

not

a
disclaimer
these
opinions
are
mine
what
about
guns
with
nonlethal
bullets
like
rubber
or
plastic
bullets
would
those
work
very
well
in
stopping
an
attack
