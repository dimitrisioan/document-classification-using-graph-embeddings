there
are
millions
of
cases
where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter
criminals
alas
this
is
not
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
excerpted
from
a
letter
i
wrote
a
while
ago
although
less
apparent
to
those
who
have
not
researched
the
facts
personal
protection
is
as
legitimate
a
reason
as
sport
for
the
private
citizen
to
own
a
gun
the
most
recent
research
is
that
of
dr
gary
kleck
of
the
florida
state
university
school
of
criminology
he
found
that
handguns
are
more
often
used
by
victims
to
defeat
crime
than
by
criminals
to
commit
it
vs
respectively
in
this
study
these
figures
are
even
more
encouraging
when
you
consider
the
number
of
crimes
that
never
occur
because
of
the
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
hands
of
a
lawabiding
private
citizen
in
a
national
institute
of
justice
study
of
ten
state
prisons
across
the
country
they
found
that
of
the
felons
surveyed
had
aborted
at
least
one
crime
because
they
believed
that
the
intended
victim
was
armed
and
agreed
that
most
criminals
are
more
worried
about
meeting
an
armed
victim
than
they
are
about
running
into
the
police
one
of
the
most
heinous
of
crimes
is
that
against
the
women
of
this
country
it
has
been
my
recent
observation
that
more
women
are
purchasing
handguns
for
defense
in
response
to
the
present
danger
of
these
assaults
this
should
be
taken
as
encouraging
news
if
the
events
of
orlando
florida
are
any
indicator
in
the
late
s
the
female
populace
was
plagued
with
a
series
of
brutal
assaults
just
the
publicity
of
the
record
number
of
women
buying
guns
and
obtaining
training
resulted
in
an
decrease
in
rape
for
that
area
the
only
city
of
its
size
in
the
country
to
experience
a
decrease
of
crime
for
that
year
additionally
a
us
justice
department
study
of
attempted
rapes
showed
that
overall
when
rape
is
attempted
the
completion
rate
is
but
when
a
woman
defends
herself
with
a
gun
the
completion
rate
drops
to
g
