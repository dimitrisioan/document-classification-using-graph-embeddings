the

no

the
vast
majority
get
through
life
without
ever
having
to
own
use
or
display
a
firearm
given
society
as
we
now
experience
it
it
seems
safer
to
get
rid
of
as
many
guns
as
possible
considering
that
the
uses
include
self
defense
hunting
target
shooting
and
collecting
i
dont
buy
the
notion
that
the
vast
majority
of
people
dont
own
use
or
display
a
firearm
but
lets
say
your
contention
is
true
whats
the
point
of
getting
rid
of
as
many
guns
as
possible
if
they
werent
being
used
anyway
david
olson
well
i
did
say
well
put
it
out
and
well
put
it
out
when
we
can
but
i
dont
know
what
we
can
put
out
or
when
we
can
put
it
out
