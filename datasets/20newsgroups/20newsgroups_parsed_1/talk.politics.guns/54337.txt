re
atf
burns
dividian
ranch
no
survivors
in
article
writes
cnn
is
reporting
as
i
write
this
that
the
atf
has
ignited
all
the
buildings
of
the
branch
dividian
ranch
near
waco
tx
the
lies
from
atf
say
holes
were
made
in
the
walls
and
nonlethal
tear
gas
pumped
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
started
the
whole
thing
went
up
all
buildings
are
aflame
no
one
has
escaped
i
think
it
obvious
that
the
atf
used
armored
flamethrower
vehicles
to
pump
in
unlit
napalm
then
let
the
wood
stove
inside
ignite
it
well
actually
the
davidians
koreshians
started
the
fire
themselves
the
last
i
heard
around
est
eight
people
ran
out
into
the
feilds
surrounding
the
compound
all
were
captured
and
two
admitted
to
setting
the
fire
i
dont
buy
your
napalm
theory
at
all
although
it
would
have
made
a
great
commercial
for
my
sig
why
the
hell
would
they
have
a
wood
stove
burning
on
such
a
warm
day
flame
throwers
use
liquid
petroleum
napalm
is
more
of
a
gel
now
to
further
dispute
your
theory
the
diluted
cs
gas
was
inserted
around
if
i
understood
correctly
the
place
didnt
start
burning
until
around
or
this
is
murder
atf
murderers
butchers
this
is
genocidal
massslaughter
of
innocent
people
including
children
i
have
predicted
this
from
the
start
but
god
it
sickens
me
to
see
it
happen
i
had
hoped
i
was
wrong
i
had
hoped
that
there
was
still
some
shred
of
the
america
i
grew
up
with
and
loved
left
alive
i
was
wrong
the
nazis
have
won
calm
down
kid
vernon
koreshs
real
name
said
himself
that
he
would
not
leave
that
compound
alive
the
inhabitants
thereof
had
accepted
the
fact
that
they
may
very
well
have
to
kill
themselves
before
it
was
all
over
i
repeat
as
of
this
time
there
are
no
survivors
there
are
at
least
eight
survivors
a
caller
on
rush
limbaugh
today
suggested
that
the
rest
may
even
be
hiding
in
underground
bunkers
thats
not
such
a
wild
idea
considering
their
weaponry
and
resolve
god
help
us
all
please
crosspost
dont
let
them
get
away
with
the
slaughter
of
the
children
w
k
gorman
an
american
in
tears
sheesh
get
over
it
i
havent
heard
read
such
ranting
since
the
hindenberg
burned
this
should
have
ended
days
ago
im
glad
my
tax
dollars
have
finally
stopped
working
to
pay
a
bunch
of
guys
to
stand
around
and
give
press
conferences
now
they
can
get
back
to
more
important
things
like
catching
cigarrette
smugglers
troy
napalm
sticks
to
kids
