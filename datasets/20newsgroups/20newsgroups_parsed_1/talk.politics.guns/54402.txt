re
some
more
about
gun
control
in
article
stephen
graham
writes
its
worth
noting
that
us
vs
miller
sustained
millers
conviction
of
possession
of
an
illegal
firearm
noting
that
a
sawedoff
shotgun
was
not
a
proper
militia
weapon
therefore
us
vs
miller
supports
limited
government
regulation
of
firearms
then
it
also
supports
basing
such
regulations
on
ignorance
miller
had
disappeared
and
nobody
bothered
to
present
his
side
to
the
supreme
court
in
particular
that
sawedoff
shotguns
were
used
in
the
world
war
i
trenches
and
in
other
tight
spots
ever
since
guns
had
been
invented
would
you
turn
one
down
if
you
had
to
clean
an
alley
in
e
st
louis
vegetarians
kill
too
