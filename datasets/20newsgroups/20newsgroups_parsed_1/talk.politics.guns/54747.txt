i
used
exactly
this
oneword
reply
to
suggest
a
likely
ending
to
the
siege
several
weeks
ago
but
like
masada
this
wasnt
entirely
a
government
action
the
defenders
held
out
as
long
as
they
could
and
then
killed
themselves
their
families
and
their
children
rather
than
surrender
israel
calls
the
action
of
the
zelots
heroic
and
trains
their
army
to
follow
this
example
now
that
someone
has
repeated
this
action
in
modern
times
what
do
we
call
it
liberals
and
supporters
of
clinton
say
that
costs
made
the
action
necessary
