ive
heard
that
the
color
strip
on
the
bianchi
was
put
there
to
identify
the
bianchi
fanny
pack
to
law
enforcement
they
suposedly
recieved
a
flyer
indicating
the
color
combinations
for
easy
sighting
this
has
led
to
lackluster
sales
for
the
bianchi
well
that
was
an
easy
decision
no
more
bianchi
anything

me
