be
cute
if
koresh
hit
the
trail
maybe
he
was
bodily
assumed
into
heaven
wouldnt
that
just
make
ag
renos
day
snort
i
sorta
doubt
it
however
no
bodies
by
the
time
this
message
gets
out
theyll
doubtless
have
found
bunches
but
wouldnt
it
be
interesting
if
they
had
a
tunnel
and
are
long
gone
if
they
hadnt
killed
the
atf
people
in
the
original
raid
i
think
i
would
laugh
my
ass
off
actually
to
be
honest
i
