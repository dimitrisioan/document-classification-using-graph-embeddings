so
a
person
who
keeps
a
gun
at
home
is
times
more
likely
to
die
at
home
from
a
gunshot
than
he
or
she
is
likely
to
kill
an
intruder
sounds
like
apples
n
oranges
to
me
in
any
case
has
anybody
tried
to
make
the
obvious
counterstudy
what
are
the
numbers
for
someone
who
does
not
keep
a
gun
at
home
that
is
what
is
the
ratio
of
dyingathomefromagunshot
to
killinganintruder
for
people
who
do
not
keep
guns
in
their
homes
so
what
are
is
the
ratio
of
unarmed
people
shot
to
death
in
their
homes
vs
unarmed
people
who
kill
intruders
is
it
worse
than
to
inquiring
minds
want
to
know
i
dont
know
this
specific
ratio
but
i
do
have
an
earlier
post
that
says
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
defend
someone
including
the
times
where
the
gun
isnt
fired
just
scares
the
perpetrator
away
than
it
is
to
kill
someone
including
self
defense
the
post
is
kind
of
long
but
ill
be
glad
to
dig
it
up
and
email
it
to
anyone
who
asks
doug
holland
doug

anyone
who
tries
to
take
away
my
freedom
of

will
have
to
pry
it
from
my

available
