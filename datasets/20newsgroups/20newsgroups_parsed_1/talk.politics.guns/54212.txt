send

to
rebellious
inmates
as
humanitarian
gesturespeaking
about
the
ohio
prison
riot
where
they
have
killed
at
least
one
of
the
hostage
guards
i
know
its
not
the
same
group
but
the
mindset
appears
to
be
common
to
those
what
rule
here
latelythey
wont
give
diddley
to
the
bds
in
waco
but
they
treat
criminals
as
deserving
of
humanitarian
gestures
this
is
but
another
indicator
that
the
criminal
caste
seems
to
enjoy
more
priviliges
in
todays
society
than
their
victims
or
other
law
abiding
citizens
what
is
it
that
makes
the
criminal
so
precious
to
the
leaders
of
the
system
could
it
be
that
the
criminal
is
one
of
the
tools
the
authorities
are
using
to
excuse
some
of
the
rights
negation
they
are
trying
to
foist
upon
the
law
abiding
citizen
in
the
name
of
crime
controldont
solve
the
crime
problem
because
then
the
citizen
couldnt
be
held
hostage
to
our
help
if
the
crime
problem
were
solved
in
favor
of
the
citizenvictim
at
the
expense
of
the
criminal
none
of
the
crap
such
as
rico
and
gun
banning
could
be
used
as
excuses
to
work
the
agenda
of
those
who
would
control
our
