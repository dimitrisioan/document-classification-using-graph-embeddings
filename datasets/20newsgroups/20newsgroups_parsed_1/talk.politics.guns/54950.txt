no
surrender
delivered
by
lenda
jackson
at
the
rkba
rally
in
denver
april
it
is
a
fact
of
modern
life
that
urban
residents
particularly
women
feel
threatened
a
certain
number
of
them
actually
are
threatened
there
are
immediate
threats
the
things
that
women
will
tell
you
theyre
afraid
of
the
noise
downstairs
at
night
the
lonely
walk
to
the
car
the
stranger
at
the
door
the
abusive
husband
finally
kicked
out
of
the
house
as
he
threatens
to
hurt
her
and
their
children
the
burglar
the
muggerthe
rapist
and
what
are
we
told
is
the
solution
move
get
a
dog
keep
the
door
locked
call
the
police
as
a
nexttolast
resort
learn
martial
arts
and
always
theres
the
implied
question
whats
a
pretty
little
thing
like
you
doing
without
a
husband
around
to
protect
you
but
what
if
you
dont
like
dogs
like
living
alone
dont
have
years
to
devote
learning
judo
what
if
after
examining
the
facts
a
woman
learns
that
rape
victims
using
armed
resistance
were
less
likely
to
have
the
rape
completed
and
were
less
likely
to
be
injuredkleck
than
those
using
any
other
form
of
resistance
kleck
also
true
for
robberyassaultkleck
what
if
to
our
horror
and
despair
we
find
that
citizens
can
not
depend
on
the
police
for
effective
protection
they
usually
respond
after
a
crime
has
been
committed
in
truth
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
police
are
not
responsible
for
protecting
any
individual
only
the
whole
community
as
a
society
are
we
going
to
ask
women
once
again
to
sacrifice
themselves
are
we
going
to
continue
to
deny
women
the
ability
to
help
themselves
heres
a
thought
neil
smith
in
his
book
the
probability
broach
says
no
pound
thug
can
threaten
the
well
being
or
dignity
of
a
pound
woman
who
has
two
pounds
of
iron
to
even
things
out
but
if
a
woman
decides
to
protect
herself
with
the
easiest
most
efficient
means
possible
people
especially
other
women
are
horrified
eughh
how
could
you
id
be
terrified
they
ask
how
could
you
hurt
someone
theyll
repeat
the
lie
itll
just
get
taken
away
from
you
in
truth
of
defensive
gun
uses
result
in
the
offender
taking
the
gun
away
from
the
victimkleck
well
despite
the
lies
and
the
social
pressure
some
of
us
have
already
made
that
hard
choice
weve
decided
that
we
are
not
going
to
be
victimized
by
the
muggers
burglars
or
rapists
were
buying
more
guns
than
every
before
were
learning
how
to
use
them
and
teaching
others
women
and
men
how
to
use
them
most
importantly
we
are
preparing
ourselves
mentally
to
use
our
firearms
for
our
own
defense
were
taking
our
own
security
literally
into
our
own
hands
were
going
to
stop
begging
and
pleading
and
marching
and
what
we
intend
is
to
really
take
back
the
night
but
theres
another
threat
more
insatiable
than
any
mugger
more
secretive
than
any
burglar
more
souldestroying
than
any
rapist
that
menace
is
government
and
it
threatens
us
all
we
know
that
governments
throughout
time
have
suppressed
rights
and
oppressed
people
its
the
way
they
survive
in
our
names
and
with
our
money
it
interferes
with
innocent
people
both
at
home
and
abroad
it
lies
to
us
cheats
us
steals
from
us
and
threatens
us
with
violence
no
one
knows
exactly
what
itll
do
next
what
freedom
we
will
lose
because
some
government
goon
decides
its
for
your
own
safety
or
we
know
best
any
person
who
acted
like
government
does
would
be
psychoanalyzed
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
locked
up
as
a
habitual
offender
but
this
monster
called
government
persists
and
grows
and
we
who
should
be
its
masters
have
become
its
unwilling
slaves
do
you
doubt
me
then
why
did
you
file
your
income
tax
like
any
reasonable
person
i
believe
that
being
afraid
of
something
that
can
hurt
you
is
smart
and
that
paranoia
isnt
crazy
if
someones
really
after
you
and
make
no
mistake
theyre
after
you
and
theyre
after
me
their
names
are
familiar
brady
and
reynolds
groff
metzenbahm
moynihan
and
clinton
if
were
lucky
theyll
settle
for
our
assault
rifles
our
shotguns
our
handguns
and
our
ammunition
as
citizens
we
have
only
two
choices
they
are
the
same
two
choices
given
to
women
to
surrender
or
to
fight
surrender
leads
to
the
gulag
to
the
genocide
of
pol
pot
to
the
disappearances
to
dachau
i
do
not
intend
to
surrender
a
battle
can
be
philosophical
or
political
in
the
main
the
people
keep
the
government
honest
by
threatening
to
vote
it
out
of
office
but
if
they
have
to
they
will
keep
in
mind
the
words
of
thomas
jefferson
the
tree
of
liberty
must
be
well
watered
with
the
blood
of
patriots
as
a
patriot
i
will
point
out
the
error
in
the
governments
ways
i
will
do
my
best
to
vote
the
villains
out
of
office
i
will
protest
and
write
and
speak
and
teach
our
children
justice
honor
and
truth
and
always
remember
that
rebellion
can
lead
to
bunker
hill
and
saratogaor
it
can
lead
to
tiananmen
square
when
the
time
comes
to
stand
up
if
i
have
to
give
my
life
to
keep
them
from
going
too
far
if
there
is
a
tiananmen
square
in
our
future
i
intend
to
be
there
and
no
matter
what
lies
they
tell
and
no
matter
what
laws
they
pass
i
intend
to
meet
them
with
something
more
substantial
in
my
hand
than
a
brick
my
opinions
are
of
course
my
own
