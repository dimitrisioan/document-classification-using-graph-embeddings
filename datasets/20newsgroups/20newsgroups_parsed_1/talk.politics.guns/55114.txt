and
found
out
that
hb
concealed
carry
is
scheduled
for
a
floor
vote
today
let
those
phone
calls
roll
in
well
i
dont
normally
like
to
quote
myself
but
i
just
got
some
additional
information
i
called
my
state
rep
to
express
my
support
and
the
person
there
informed
me
that
its
actually
just
a
second
reading
of
the
bill
three
are
required
for
further
consideration
im
not
sure
what
that
means
and
im
also
not
sure
why
theres
a
discrepancy
between
what
the
two
offices
are
telling
me
