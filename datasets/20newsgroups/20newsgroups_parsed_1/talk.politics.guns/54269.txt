re
constitutionality
of
usc
o
in
article
brian
sheets
writes
you
know
i
was
reading
usc
and
something
just
did
not
make
sence
and
i
was
wondering
if
someone
could
help
me
out
say
usc
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
transfer
or
possess
a
machinegun
well
i
got
to
looking
in
my
law
dictionary
and
i
found
that
a
person
might
also
be
an
artificial
entity
that
is
created
by
government
and
has
no
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
so
what
i
dont
understand
is
how
a
statute
like
can
be
enforced
on
an
individual
so
someone
tell
me
how
my
government
can
tell
me
what
i
can
or
can
not
possess
just
passing
a
law
does
not
make
it
law
sorry
but
i
really
cant
figure
out
what
youre
trying
to
say
above
everyone
knows
that
laws
are
constitional
until
it
goes
to
court
not
exactly
an
unconstitutional
act
is
not
law
it
confers
no
rights
it
imposes
no
duties
affords
no
protection
it
creates
no
office
it
is
in
legal
contemplation
as
inoperative
as
though
it
had
never
been
passed
norton
vs
shelby
county
us
p
the
general
rule
is
that
an
unconstitutional
statute
though
having
the
form
and
name
of
law
is
in
reality
no
law
but
is
wholly
void
and
ineffective
for
any
purpose
since
unconstitutionality
dates
from
the
time
of
its
enactment
and
not
merely
from
the
date
of
the
decision
so
branding
it
no
on
is
bound
to
obey
an
uncontitutional
law
and
no
courts
are
bound
to
enforce
it
am
jur
d
sec
late
d
sec
so
has
it
ever
gone
to
court
not
just
your
run
of
the
mill
ok
i
had
it
i
am
guilty
put
me
in
jail
has
anyone
ever
claimed
that
they
had
a
right
to
possess
and
was
told
by
the
supreme
court
that
they
didnt
have
that
right
automatic
weapons
no
the
supreme
court
has
never
heard
such
a
case
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
investors
