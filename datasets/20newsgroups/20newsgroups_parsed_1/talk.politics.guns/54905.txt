im
not
saying
you
should
ban
guns
or
that
you
should
take
them
away
from
responsible
owners
but
this
is
all
gun
control
laws
end
up
doing
politicians
can
never
manage
to
get
a
handle
on
those
who
obtain
arms
illegally
so
all
their
laws
can
ever
do
is
further
restrict
people
who
obtain
them
legally
karen
mcnutt
a
local
attorney
states
that
there
are
about
two
million
licensed
gun
owners
in
massachusetts
in
the
past
year
the
number
of
licensed
gun
owners
involved
in
gun
crimes
was
something
like
six
yet
there
were
a
large
number
of
gun
crimes
in
the
state
last
year
does
passing
laws
that
will
further
restricting
only
those
people
already
obeying
laws
pay
any
dividents
all
im
saing
is
that
guns
should
be
treated
with
respect
from
owners
sellers
and
legislators
so
far
ive
seen
them
treated
with
the
least
respect
by
legislators
i
believe
guns
are
a
problem
in
many
countries
and
that
crime
rates
would
fell
if
they
were
more
restricted
see
this
is
what
i
call
the
argument
from
religion
i
believe
dont
believe
its
not
necessary
to
take
this
on
faith
go
look
at
the
history
of
countries
that
passed
gun
restrictions
pay
particular
attention
to
whether
or
not
violent
crime
was
higher
before
the
restrictions
and
lower
after
dont
look
at
violent
gun
crimes
thats
begging
the
question
you
may
be
very
surprised
if
all
crimes
done
with
guns
stopped
and
all
accidents
also
stopped
or
was
reduced
to
a
minimum
then
i
would
consider
lifting
all
gun
control
you
have
this
absolutely
backwards
if
crime
stopped
in
the
presence
of
strict
gun
control
there
is
no
way
i
would
consider
lifting
any
of
it
however
if
gun
control
made
absolutely
no
improvement
in
the
violent
crime
rate
thats
when
i
would
have
it
lifted
think
about
it
so
far
none
of
the
stats
show
any
improvement
likevise
if
caraccidents
fell
to
a
minimum
in
europe
i
and
probably
most
people
i
know
would
demand
easier
driverstests
ca
hours
and
more
than
today
do
you
really
think
drivers
tests
are
any
indication
of
your
propensity
for
having
accidents
ive
never
known
anybody
stupid
enough
to
take
a
driving
test
while
drunk
after
having
been
up
all
night
with
two
fighting
kids
in
the
back
seat
with
a
hot
cup
of
coffee
on
their
lap
or
while
putting
on
makeup
reading
the
newspaper
or
talking
on
their
cellular
phone
but
thats
what
theyre
doing
when
they
have
those
accidents
in
other
words
we
should
have
legislation
because
its
neccacery
how
can
anything
that
has
no
positive
effect
at
all
ever
be
necessary
the
one
gunmonth
case
in
virginia
i
was
thinking
about
the
reactions
on
the
proposal
loud
screeming
about
civil
rights
and
amendment
and
it
didnt
help
any
of
it
winnie
the
poh
do
you
want
peace
or
weapons
winnie
yes
please
im
sorry
i
dont
remember
any
story
where
winnie
the
pooh
was
offered
weapons
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
