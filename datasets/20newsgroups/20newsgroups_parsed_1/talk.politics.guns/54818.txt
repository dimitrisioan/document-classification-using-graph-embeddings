re
jffo
has
gone
a
bit
too
far
morris
the
cat
writes
would
somebody
please
post
evidence
that
the
gun
control
act
of
is
a
verbatim
transcription
of
a
nazi
law
the
evidence
is
that
the
two
laws
are
basically
identical
however
thats
not
evidence
that
one
is
a
copy
of
the
other
theres
no
evidence
that
the
gcas
authors
used
the
nazi
law
as
a
guide
yes
they
ended
up
with
roughly
the
same
thing
but
that
comes
from
their
shared
goal
disarming
those
menacing
minorities
i
thought
the
same
thing
too
until
jpfos
rkba
article
in
the
latest
guns
ammo
at
the
newstands
this
article
makes
it
certain
that
sen
thomas
dodd
dmd
back
before
definitely
asked
for
a
translation
of
the
german
weapons
laws
back
then
read
the
article
and
see
what
you
think
of
jpfos
argument
they
note
that
ted
kennedy
and
john
dingell
are
among
the
three
of
the
originals
left
from
the
stuff
and
they
are
asking
that
folks
request
of
john
dingell
that
he
introduce
legislation
to
lift
gca
something
which
i
would
support
whole
heartedly
andy
can
someone
post
a
general
idea
of
what
gca
does
thanks
