i
agree
that
they
deserved
a
trial
they
had
more
than
days
to
come
out
and
get
their
trial
they
chose
to
keep
the
children
with
them
and
to
stay
inside
they
chose
to
stay
inside
even
after
they
were
tear
gassed
i
do
not
find
these
actions
rational
even
noriega
was
smart
enough
to
give
up
and
go
for
the
trial
he
deserved
mr
roby
you
are
a
government
sucking
heartless
bastard
unworthy
of
comment
but
apparently
true
my
opinion
only
of
course
so
your
opinion
is
truth
i
see
humans
died
yesterday
humans
who
would
not
have
died
if
the
fbi
had
not
taken
the
actions
they
did
that
is
the
undeniable
truth
i
cried
for
them
nor
would
they
have
died
if
they
had
come
out
with
their
hands
empty
that
is
undeniable
truth
no
it
is
not
it
is
possible
the
fbi
planned
for
this
to
happen
and
the
gunfire
heard
was
the
fbi
keeping
the
folks
inside
im
not
proposing
this
as
the
way
it
went
down
but
just
to
point
out
that
its
not
undeniable
that
if
they
walked
out
yesterday
they
would
be
alive
today
you
can
believe
that
if
you
wish
it
is
undeniable
however
that
people
have
left
the
compound
unharmed
and
alive
earier
in
the
standoff
and
since
their
leader
was
preaching
that
they
would
have
an
apocalypse
you
can
not
say
undeniably
that
there
wouldnt
have
been
a
mass
suicide
if
the
fbi
had
simply
stayed
outside
and
waited
another
days
my
heart
bleeds
just
as
much
as
yours
for
the
children
who
were
never
released
given
days
of
ample
opportunities
to
do
so
my
heart
also
bleeds
for
people
so
blinded
by
religious
devotion
to
not
have
the
common
sense
to
leave
the
compound
when
tanks
came
up
and
started
dropping
in
tear
gas
early
in
the
morning
my
heart
bleeds
for
no
one
you
are
the
bleeding
heart
and
im
sure
beyond
any
possible
doubt
that
you
do
not
feel
for
those
people
as
i
do
you
can
not
say
the
heartless
things
you
have
said
if
you
did
i
am
the
heartless
bleeding
heart
you
are
not
making
sense
you
seem
to
have
no
concern
that
someone
would
keep
children
inside
this
compound
when
they
had
days
to
let
them
out
that
sounds
pretty
heartless
to
me
i
just
heard
on
the
news
that
some
of
the
survivors
regret
they
hadnt
stayed
in
the
inferno
to
prove
their
loyalty
to
koresh
this
makes
me
sad
and
sick
you
seem
to
say
they
got
what
they
deserved
i
do
not
think
this
however
if
they
did
set
the
fire
which
started
in
more
than
one
place
and
spread
very
quickly
then
they
got
what
they
wanted
and
put
into
motion
themselves
they
got
what
they
wanted
what
kind
of
creature
are
you
that
you
can
believe
this
have
you
ever
heard
of
jonestown
the
sad
thing
is
the
people
inside
the
compound
were
the
authority
worshipers
and
their
only
authority
was
koreshhowell
if
these
people
were
able
to
think
for
themselves
there
would
likely
be
a
lot
more
survivors
today
koresh
preached
a
fiery
apocalypse
as
early
as
last
year
i
see
the
batf
is
going
to
be
investigated
by
the
justice
dept
and
likely
by
arlen
spectre
and
congress
this
is
good
they
have
bungled
the
affair
from
the
start
we
agree
on
this
now
lets
have
your
god
the
fbi
investigated
too
by
all
means
the
fbi
should
be
investigated
too
btw
i
thought
the
second
ammendment
was
god
