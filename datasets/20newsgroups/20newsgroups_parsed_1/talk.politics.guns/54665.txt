and
i
suppose
the
fbi
also
prevented
them
from
coming
out
with
their
hands
up
while
national
tv
cameras
watch
watch
from
where
two
miles
away
far
enough
away
that
whatever
really
happenned
must
be
explained
through
the
vengeful
filter
of
a
humiliated
agency
that
said
quote
enough
is
enough
please
tell
me
what
you
think
would
have
happened
had
the
people
come
out
with
their
hands
up
several
weeks
ago
it
didnt
happen
and
who
is
responsible
for
it
not
happening
certainly
not
the
children
koresh
was
calling
the
shots
he
was
talking
with
his
lawyer
and
the
fbi
since
others
were
released
safely
there
is
no
sane
reason
for
keeping
the
children
inside
the
compound
the
fbi
and
koresh
were
calling
the
shots
and
there
were
very
sane
reasons
for
keeping
the
children
if
they
let
them
go
the
parents
would
never
see
them
again
that
is
not
an
easy
choice
in
spite
of
you
cold
attitude
about
it
scenario
that
is
simplest
and
most
plausible
i
do
not
generally
believe
in
conspiracy
theories
that
involve
complicated
and
unlikely
scenarios
the
fbi
sent
letters
to
martin
luther
kings
wife
insinuating
that
mlk
was
having
an
affair
again
please
tell
us
exactly
how
much
you
trust
our
supposedly
benevolent
government
more
than
someone
who
would
not
release
children
from
the
compound
obviously
you
are
an
authority
worshiper
not
at
all
are
you
a
koresh
worshiper
i
am
a
constitution
worshiper
you
quite
obviously
eat
anything
the
authorities
feed
you
without
doubt
which
makes
you
no
different
that
a
koresh
worshiper
ie
more
than
david
koreshvernon
howelljesus
christ
i
saw
lengthy
excerpts
from
an
australian
documentary
made
in
that
clearly
showed
that
this
was
a
cult
give
me
a
camera
and
time
with
you
and
i
can
present
excerpts
that
show
you
to
be
a
cult
leader
guarenteed
thanks
for
my
laugh
of
the
day
definitely
a
very
silly
supposition
if
you
do
not
believe
this
you
are
truly
naive
it
is
not
only
possible
it
is
easy
i
worked
in
the
broadcast
profession
at
a
network
station
in
the
late
s
i
know
what
im
saying
here
embarrasing
footage
is
easy
to
get
add
a
little
sinister
music
and
the
right
voiceover
and
ill
have
you
mother
agreeing
to
commit
you
you
should
at
least
view
the
whole
documentary
before
you
claim
it
as
a
source
i
would
if
i
could
the
news
show
that
showed
the
lengthy
excerpts
also
had
interviews
with
the
filmmaker
who
made
the
documentary
who
basically
confirmed
what
was
shown
in
the
excerpts
from
the
time
he
spent
at
the
compound
in
the
news
shows
were
looking
for
excerpts
which
backed
their
position
do
you
think
they
would
show
excerpts
which
disproved
their
points
i
am
not
pleased
with
the
batf
handling
of
the
affair
i
think
they
bungled
it
badly
from
the
start
but
i
dont
think
they
are
responsible
for
the
fire
which
started
in
two
different
places
two
places
eh
you
saw
this
or
did
the
wonderful
fbi
tell
you
this
i
saw
one
place
i
believe
that
this
was
reported
by
local
radio
reporters
on
site
a
fire
started
in
a
three
story
tower
at
the
same
time
as
the
two
story
window
shown
on
the
tv
coverage
the
reports
of
multistarts
came
solely
from
the
fbi
anyone
observing
the
fire
from
the
available
video
would
be
hard
pressed
to
see
more
than
one
point
of
fire
which
spread
across
the
compound
as
a
uniform
rate
the
batf
is
by
no
means
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
i
suspect
that
there
were
plenty
of
camerapeople
willing
to
risk
small
arms
fire
to
get
some
good
footage
these
people
were
told
to
get
the
hell
out
of
camera
range
why
couldnt
answer
this
one
eh
this
is
the
most
important
question
of
all
it
is
the
root
cause
of
all
the
other
suspicion
i
thought
about
mentioning
how
reagan
and
the
military
treated
the
press
in
grenada
and
how
that
set
the
precedent
but
decided
it
wasnt
worthy
of
discussion
if
the
news
reporter
got
shot
you
can
bet
his
family
would
sue
the
government
for
letting
him
into
the
danger
area
no
reported
has
ever
sued
the
government
for
such
a
situation
they
know
the
dangers
remember
the
batf
invited
the
initial
coverage
and
how
about
a
simple
remotecontrolled
camera
or
two
there
were
ways
to
provide
media
access
the
fbi
obviously
just
didnt
want
any
the
root
cause
of
suspicion
in
my
mind
is
why
people
wouldnt
flee
a
building
that
had
numerous
exits
during
the
minutes
time
it
took
to
burn
down
or
why
didnt
they
flee
hours
earlier
when
the
tear
gas
was
first
introduced
i
can
find
no
rational
explanation
for
their
behavior
i
can
find
several
tear
gas
and
smoke
making
it
impossible
to
remove
the
barricades
flames
blocking
exits
to
the
saferooms
perhaps
the
gun
shots
were
from
the
fbi
keeping
them
pinned
in
who
knows
jim
im
always
rethinking
that
theres
never
been
a
day
when
i
havent
rethought
that
but
i
cant
do
that
by
myself
