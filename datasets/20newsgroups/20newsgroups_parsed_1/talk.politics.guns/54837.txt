re
change
of
name
we
all
know
what
a
quisling
is
right
obviously
we
dont
vidkun
quisling
is
known
to
be
a
traitor
in
norway
not
a
censor
if
i
have
betrayed
my
country
norway
bescause
i
implied
that
som
of
you
jumped
to
conclusionssound
a
little
paranoid
then
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
quislings
in
norway
perhaps
i
wasnt
sufficiently
clear
i
was
not
accusing
you
of
being
a
quisling
the
quislings
are
in
our
own
us
government
throwing
away
the
peoples
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
at
least
thats
where
the
ones
that
i
intended
to
refer
to
are
i
figured
that
people
on
this
newsgroup
would
interpret
that
as
intended
but
obviously
something
of
my
intent
got
lost
