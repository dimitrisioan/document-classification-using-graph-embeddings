humans
died
yesterday
humans
who
would
not
have
died
if
the
fbi
had
not
taken
the
actions
they
did
that
is
the
undeniable
truth
the
question
is
for
how
long
even
if
the
fbi
had
done
nothing
i
guess
the
bds
would
have
committed
suicide
but
maybe
not
until
hunger
and
thirst
gave
them
the
choice
between
sucide
or
surrender
the
bds
was
warned
in
beforehand
about
the
fbi
action
they
had
the
chance
to
surrender
and
get
a
fair
trial
no
matter
who
started
the
fire
the
bds
were
responsible
for
peole
dying
no
one
else
this
is
of
course
your
opinion
i
differ
greatly
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
fbi
at
least
shares
in
the
blame
