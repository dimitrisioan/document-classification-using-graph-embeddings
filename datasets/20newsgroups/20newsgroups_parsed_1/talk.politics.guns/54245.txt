re
ban
all
firearms
as
quoted
from
by
firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
that
depends
only
on
the
profit
of
doing
so
the
differences
in
cost
of
production
will
determine
local
vs
smuggle
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
those
of
us
who
have
actually
made
semiautos
fullautos
are
easier
are
getting
quite
a
giggle
out
of
this
id
estimate
that
of
the
people
at
my
high
school
couldnt
do
it
i
was
one
of
the
few
who
failed
shop
people
who
have
actually
seen
me
do
mechanical
work
would
probably
say
that
is
more
like
it
starting
with
even
of
the
population
you
can
be
sure
that
enough
people
will
be
motivated
firearms
from
scratch
highranking
crime
figures
could
obtain
imported
uzis
and
such
but
the
average
person
and
average
thug
would
be
lucky
to
get
a
zipgun
and
would
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
how
much
is
through
the
nose
after
all
we
know
quite
a
bit
about
how
much
a
gun
is
worth
to
a
criminal
so
if
that
is
dwarfed
by
the
price
demanded
by
the
bad
part
of
that
the
relevant
economic
analysis
has
been
made
the
profit
of
gun
crime
is
high
enough
that
the
price
required
to
push
criminals
out
of
the
market
is
high
enough
that
everyone
will
be
motivated
that
analysis
ignored
some
improvements
in
the
criminal
gun
market
that
could
make
them
even
cheaper
theyre
not
efficiently
used
now
but
a
loaner
set
up
would
drive
the
value
still
higher
without
affecting
criminal
use
