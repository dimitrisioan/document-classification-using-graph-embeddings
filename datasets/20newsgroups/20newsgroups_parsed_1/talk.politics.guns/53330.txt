on
a
los
angeles
radio
station
last
weekend
the
lawyers
for
the
family
of
the
murdered
rancher
said
that
the
los
angeles
sheriffs
department
had
an
assessment
done
of
the
ranchers
property
before
the
raid
the
briefing
documents
for
the
raid
had
a
notation
on
them
about
a
similar
local
property
which
had
sold
for
prior
to
the
raid
if
recent
tv
coverage
can
be
believed
this
strongly
implies
that
the
sheriffs
department
wanted
the
property
any
drugs
which
were
not
found
were
only
an
excuse
the

came
to
the
same
conclusion
in
the
report
he
released
which
lambasted
the
sheriffs
office
