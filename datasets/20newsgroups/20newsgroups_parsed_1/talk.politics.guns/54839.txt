if
there
was
a
large
propane
tank
and
it
was
breached
dont
you
think
that
there
would
be
an
identifiable
explosion
from
what
i
saw
of
the
videotape
there
was
an
explosion
which
looked
more
like
one
due
to
propane
rather
than
official
version
ammunition
i
would
agree
that
a
propane
explosion
is
as
likely
as
an
ammunitionexplosives
blast
my
question
was
directed
to
the
person
who
claimed
that
the
propane
tank
was
likely
ruptured
by
the
tank
before
or
just
as
the
fire
started
if
that
were
true
shouldnt
the
explosion
have
happened
very
soon
after
the
fires
started
the
only
evidence
that
exists
right
now
at
least
what
we
know
about
is
various
claims
and
counter
claims
im
waiting
until
the
hard
evidence
is
released
what
about
you
if
only
we
could
be
certain
that
the
hard
evidence
will
be
released
the
fbi
has
made
such
a
fuss
over
the
videotapes
and
other
evidence
that
they
have
to
release
something
sooner
or
later
its
going
to
happen
and
well
get
to
see
for
ourselves
often
law
enforcement
agencies
will
withold
evidence
from
public
view
until
the
investigation
is
over
