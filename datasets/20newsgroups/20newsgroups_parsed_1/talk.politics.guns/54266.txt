writes
lets
prohibit
arms
carrying
by
police
when
offduty
or
if
they
make
the
assertion
that
well
i
need
to
maintain
my
gun
lets
make
it
regulation
that
they
can
carry
an
unloaded
firearm
home
that
its
only
fair
that
they
be
just
as
helpless
as
poor
schmuck
coming
home
from
his
computer

states
in
the
latest
swat
magazine
that
anticops
better
watch
out
for
this
schism
between
rkba
folks
and
the
police
he
asks
the
rhetorical
question
of
what
if
whats
left
of
the
gun
lobby
starts
demanding
the
disarmament
of
the
police
well
i
guess
antigun
cops
who
think
only
they
should
be
armed
along
with
the
wealthy
and
politically
connected
should
be
made
to
realize
that
screwing
can
cut
in
ways
they
have
yet
to
imagine
we
all
know
this
will
never
happen
because
the
police
are
under
the
wings
of
government
they
will
always
be
considered
more
important
than
citizens
government
pens
pencils
and
paper
are
considered
more
important
than
citizens
i
think
we
have
a
problem
with
our
government
