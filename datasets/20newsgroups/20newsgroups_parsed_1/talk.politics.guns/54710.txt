or
the
cultists
i
think
ill
quote
the
bbc
quoting
actually
voice
interview
one
of
the
two
british
survivors
he
claimed
that
the
fire
started
when
the
tanks
caused
an
internal
wooden
wallroof
to
collapse
knocking
over
kerosene
lamps
and
that
they
had
no
suicide
plan
if
the
fbi
started
the
fire
why
didnt
people
flee
the
burning
building
i
dont
know
why
this
is
the
ap
story
from
fri
morning
as
the
walls
came
tumbling
down
and
tear
gas
filled
the
air
cult
leader
david
koresh
sprang
into
action
he
left
his
thirdfloor
bedroom
and
began
looking
around
the
house
making
sure
women
and
children
were
secure
and
checking
that
everyone
had
their
gas
masks
on
properly
within
hours
the
compound
became
an
inferno
nine
branch
davidians
excaped
this
is
their
story
gleaned
from
lawyers
who
spoke
with
six
of
them
who
are
jailed
on
charges
that
include
conspiracy
and
murder
that
day
the
six
said
a
portable
radio
offered
the
only
contact
with
the
outside
world
since
koreshs
righthand
man
steve
schneider
ripped
out
the
compoundss
phone
line
after
fbi
agents
called
before
dawn
monday
saying
this
was
the
cults
last
chance
come
out
or
prepare
to
get
forced
out
they
kept
their
word
by
dawn
tanks
were
battering
the
mount
carmel
compound
punching
for
hours
to
creat
holes
for
tear
gas
to
enter
the
bd
meanwhile
proceeded
with
their
daily
routines
strapped
into
gas
masks
the
women
did
laundry
others
read
bibles
in
their
rooms
the
children
all
under
remained
by
their
mothers
sides
still
it
was
hard
to
ignore
what
was
happening
around
them
each
time
a
tank
rammed
the
poorlyconstructed
building
it
shook
violently
cult
members
dodges
falling
gypsum
wallboard
and
doors
hundreds
of
gas
canisters
hurled
in
from
the
armored
vehicles
were
filling
the
air
with
noxious
fumes
the
flying
canisters
were
more
frightening
than
the
tanks
at
least
one
man
was
hit
in
the
face
the
gas
began
filling
the
air
driven
by
heavy
gusts
of
wind
coming
through
windows
and
the
holes
the
tanks
made
scattered
throughout
the
house
the
cult
members
made
no
efforts
to
gather
then
the
fbi
sent
in
its
biggest
weapon
a
massive
armored
vehicle
headed
for
a
chamber
lined
with
cinder
blocks
where
authorities
hoped
to
find
koresh
and
schneider
and
fire
tear
gas
directly
at
them
here
the
cult
members
story
diverges
from
the
governments
version
the
fbi
says
cult
members
set
fires
in
three
places
but
each
of
the
six
cult
members
in
separate
discussions
with
lawyers
consistently
gave
versions
at
odds
with
the
fbis
account
they
say
the
tank
flattened
a
barrel
of
propane
spilling
its
contents
and
as
the
tank
thundered
through
the
house
it
tipped
over
lit
lanterns
spitting
flames
that
ignited
the
propane
and
other
flammables
the
home
of
used
lumber
plywood
and
wallboard
tacked
together
with
tar
paper
was
vulnerable
the
building
erupted
nine
bds
escaped
jumping
through
windows
and
dashing
through
other
openings
others
died
groping
in
the
blackness
