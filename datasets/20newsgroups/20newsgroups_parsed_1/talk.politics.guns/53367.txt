q
do
you
think
that
hic
et

really
believe
that
the
laws
that
they
are
trying
to
get
passed
are
for
the
good
or
are
they
just
lying
through
their
teeth
and
trying
to
disarm
the
populace
i
think
that
hci
people
honestly
believe
that
passing
more
gun
control
laws
will
be
in
the
best
interests
of
public
safety
why
do
i
think
this
because
i
used
to
buy
the
hci
line
during
my
freshman
year
their
line
made
so
much
sense
only
people
who
need
guns
should
be
able
to
get
them
and
the
people
who
need
them
are
the
police
and
other
elites
unfortunately
for
us
this
position
is
highly
emotional
and
not
well
thoughtout
they
never
stop
to
think
that
hcis
position
basically
says
that
the
nonelite
are
incompetents
thats
you
and
me
folks
and
that
the
second
amendment
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
hunting
or
other
legitimate
uses
which
excludes
overthrowing
tyrannical
governments
and
defending
yourself
when
the
police
have
proven
they
cant
protect
you
we
all
know
that
the
end
result
regardless
of
the
intention
will
be
to
have
a
much
easier
to
subdue
population
for
the
unnwo
this
is
definitely
a
motivation
of
many
in
power
but
i
wonder
to
what
degree
this
is
planned
vs
just
duped
every
procontrol
person
ive
talked
to
is
always
left
stumped
when
i
simply
argue
the
facts
of
gun
control
that
it
has
yet
to
be
proven
to
lower
crime
rates
and
weapons
terminology
and
im
no
expert
but
explaining
exactly
how
an
evil
semiautomatic
weapon
really
works
does
wonders
i
hvae
personally
found
wellreasoned
arguments
to
be
most
effective
against
the
emotional
procontrol
people
the
trick
is
to
get
them
to
realize
that
the
second
amendment
exists
not
for
hunters
but
for
the
oppressed
and
the
terrorized
