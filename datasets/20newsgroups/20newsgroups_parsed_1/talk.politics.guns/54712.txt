meyers
writes
a
bill
to
establish
the
right
to
obtain
firearms
for
security
and
to
use
firearms
in
defense
of
self

or

maybe
im
too
religious
but
when
i
see
a
bill
to
establish
a
right
i
wince
keep
in
mind
what
the
law
giveth
the
law
can
taketh
away
hey
guys
youre
absolutely
correct
and
well
on
the
way
to
winning
this
battle
and
losing
the
war
yes
there
are
serious
philosophical
flaws
in
hr
technical
ones
too
howd
you
like
to
sue
the
feds
lose
and
have
to
pay
their
reasonable
attorneys
fee
still
i
have
one
basic
question
compared
to
what
weve
got
is
hr
a
better
or
b
worse
this
one
shouldnt
even
take
you
three
guesses
compared
to
the
second
amendment
i
think
its
worse
the
problem
is
the
devil
is
in
the
details
you
know
the
brady
bill
sounds
like
a
good
idea
too
until
you
discover
that
there
is
no
check
and
that
the
police
dont
have
to
allow
your
purchase
even
if
you
check
out
and
that
you
have
no
recourse
if
they
dont
are
there
any
loopholes
here
im
no
lawyer
i
cant
be
sure
i
would
have
never
noticed
the
second
one
mentioned
above
in
the
brady
bill
for
example
the
more
words
involved
the
more
details
what
was
that
saying
about
abraham
lincoln
requiring
words
to
free
the
slaves
and
the
modern
congress
requiring
words
to
describe
price
controls
on
rice
if
theres
a
good
enough
show
of
support
for
hr
maybe
for
a
change
we
could
be
the
ones
saying
its
a
reasonable
first
step
that
only
works
with
bad
laws
good
laws
are
like
good
computer
programs
quality
has
to
be
written
in
from
the
start
not
added
on
later
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
