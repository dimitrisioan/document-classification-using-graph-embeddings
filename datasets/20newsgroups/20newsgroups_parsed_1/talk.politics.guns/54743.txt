napalm
then
let
the
wood
stove
inside
ignite
it
for
heating
purposes
because
of
the
weather
in
texas
everyone
now
claims
that
it
was
for
cooking
stop
and
think
about
this
this
whole
thread
is
rediculous
who
cares
if
they
had
a
stove
going
or
not
does
it
matter
if
they
had
a
stove
burning
or
lanterns
burning
or
candles
burning
or
someone
smoking
etc
etc
etc
the
premise
is
that
the
fbi
was
filling
the
house
with
napalm
so
that
it
would
catch
fire
this
is
crazy
fbi
was
not
pumping
napalm
into
the
davidians
home
you
will
have
to
have
pretty
damn
strong
evidence
to
convince
me
of
that
i
can
believe
mass
suicidemurder
by
koresh
i
can
believe
an
accident
by
the
davidians
i
can
believe
an
accident
by
the
fbi
i
can
easily
believe
mass
stupidity
on
all
sides
but
i
can
not
believe
that
the
fbi
lit
this
fire
intentionally
no
way
i
tend
to
agree
but
i
would
like
a
better
explanation
of
why
the
fbi
stopped
the
firetrucks
at
the
gate
i
saw
this
in
realtime
it
concerns
me
that
the
fbi
appeared
to
not
be
too
interested
in
stopping
the
fire
after
it
started
and
actually
started
flying
hueys
around
the
compound
which
had
to
add
in
some
small
part
to
the
winds
driving
the
fire
