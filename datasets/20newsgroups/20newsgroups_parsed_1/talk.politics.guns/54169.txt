the
vast
majority
get
through
life
without
ever
having
to
own
use
or
display
a
firearm
i
suppose
that
depends
on
how
you
define
vast
majority
you
are
correct
about
majority
somewhere
between
out
of
three
and
one
out
of
will
at
some
period
in
their
lives
experience
a
violent
assault
the
risk
is
generally
higher
than
emergency
medical
problems
like
heart
attack
and
stroke
vast
is
probably
too
loose
a
term
with
approximately
americans
using
firearms
each
year
over
a
year
period
we
get
roughly
since
some
may
have
to
do
this
more
than
once
million
americans
with
experience
in
using
firearms
for
self
defense
yields
percent
of
the
population
yes
i
know
that
is
a
real
rough
estimate
were
closer
to
million
now
but
many
of
these
are
minors
and
should
be
included
etc
thus
the
percentage
if
anything
is
low
at
any
rate
most
minority
groups
in
this
range
are
not
usually
referred
to
as
tiny
minorities
so
i
dont
see
how
the
other
part
of
the
group
can
be
referred
to
as
the
vast
majority
a
little
more
work
might
support
a
simple
majority
of
americans
never
use
own
or
display
a
firearm
certainly
when
you
are
talking
about
ownership
you
are
wrong
nearly
half
of
your
fellow
citizens
own
one
or
more
firearms
besides
there
are
other
means
of
selfprotection
which
can
be
just
as
effective
as
firearms
please
provide
a
list
of
other
means
that
are
as
effective
then
you
might
convince
your
local
police
departments
to
switch
good
luck
