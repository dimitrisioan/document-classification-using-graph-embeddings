the
colorado
daily
recently
reprinted
the
wall
street
journals
article
on
paxton
quigley
including
the
nefarious
little
paragraph
the
journal
tacked
onto
the
end
after
recieving
much
assistance
from
various
tpg
type
folks
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
editor
criticizing
this
last
paragraph
and
surprise
surprise
surprise
they
published
it
the
text
follows
the
colorado
daily
btw
is

boulder
student
i
think
newspaper
not
exactly
a
big
coup
but
every
little
bit
i
guess
the
title
was
the
only
thing
they

the
daily
recently
reprinted
an
article
from
the
wall
street
journal
primarily
concerned
with
paxton
quigley
author
of
armed
and
female
the
article
in
turn
cites
a
misleading
statistic
that
was
originally
reported
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
the
article
states
a
study
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
this
is
an
oftenquoted
statistic
and
it
is
misleading
for
sev
eral
reasons
outlined
below
the
study
gives
the
impression
that
if
you
own
a
gun
the
likelihood
that
you
will
successfully
use
it
to
defend
yourself
is
less
than
that
of
the
gun
being
turned
against
you
the
study
however
fails
to
take
into
account
cases
where
a
lawabiding
citizen
uses
a
gun
to
thwart
a
crime
without
actually
killing
the
perpe
trator
the
study
actually
refers
to
acquaintances
rather
than
friend
this
would
include
the
friendly
neigh
borhood
thug
who
shows
up
like
clockwork
every
month
the
second
your
grandmother
cashes
her
social
security
check
possibly
an
acquaintance
but
hardly
a
friend
the
nejm
study
is
based
on
the
immediate
dis
position
of
cases
and
fails
to
take
into
account
cases
originally
filed
as
homicides
that
were
later
ruled
to
be
selfdefense
especially
considering
the
small
sample
size
taking
these
events
into
account
has
a
sub
stantial
effect
on
the
ratio
quoted
criminologist
gary
kleck
gives
us
a
slightly
dif
erent
statistic
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
successfully
by
a
private
citizen
against
an
aggressor
than
it
is
to
kill
anyone
at
all
further
per
sons
defending
themselves
from
aggression
by
using
a
gun
fare
better
than
those
who
resist
vicimization
by
some
other
means
or
who
offer
no
resistance
at
all
statistics
available
from
the
fbi
and
other
agencies
also
show
that
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
by
a
noncriminal
to
defend
against
criminal
threat
than
to
be
used
to
commit
criminal
homicide
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
defend
against
a
criminal
threat
than
to
accidentally
kill
anybody
and
times
more
likely
to
defend
against
criminal
threat
than
to
be
used
to
commit
suicide
it
is
well
to
keep
in
mind
that
nearly
anything
can
be
proved
by
uncritical
quotation
of
statistics
one
has
to
consider
carefully
what
questions
were
asked
by
those
gathering
the
data
before
one
can
draw
an
accu
rate
conclusion
