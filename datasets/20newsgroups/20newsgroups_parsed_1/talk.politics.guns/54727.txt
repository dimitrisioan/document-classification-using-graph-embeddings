if
anyone
wants
to
understand
the
paranoid
mindset
of
koresh
i
offer
you
talkpoliticsguns
there
you
can
dredge
the
sewers
of
minds
so
hung
up
on
power
and
ego
trips
that
they
bend
reality
arround
their
own
particular
set
of
beleifs
just
what
the
hell
do
you
base
that
ludicrous
claim
on
there
are
plenty
of
fine
decent
people
people
who
readpost
to
tpg
if
any
of
these
people
are
paranoid
it
is
because
of
people
like
you
hey
dude
you
are
making
me
paranoid
what
an
argument
i
long
ago
gave
up
arguing
the
case
for
arms
control
directly
instead
i
invite
people
to
ask
themselves
would
you
want
to
be
in
a
room
full
of
the
occupants
of
talkpoliticsguns
their
personal
armouries
and
attempt
to
enter
a
discussion
with
them
id
have
a
spot
of
tea
with
them
you
probably
gave
up
on
arguing
the
case
for
arms
control
directly
long
ago
because
posters
who
know
what
they
are
talking
about
eg
frank
crary
disproved
all
your
arguments
for
why
more
gun
control
is
needed
so
you
gave
up
because
you
know
they
are
right
and
you
couldnt
refute
their
answers
no
frank
crarys
arguments
are
based
on
the
assumption
that
most
people
are
sane
normal
people
tpg
disproves
this
of
gun
owners
usenet
as
a
whole
disproves
it
of
humanity
as
a
whole
we
now
have
proof
positive
that
guns
dont
make
you
safer
buy
a
lot
of
guns
and
you
either
get
shot
in
the
no
knock
raid
or
get
the
fbi
to
burn
down
your
house
see
even
in
the
paranoid
mindset
of
tpg
there
are
good
reasons
to
support
gun
control
cuddles
n
kisses
