they
assembled
a
frightening
arsenal
of
weapons
what
exactly
did
you
find
frightening
about
their
weapons
the
lethality
in
small
part
but
mostly
what
i
found
frightening
was
the
fact
that
they
were
wielded
by
people
who
believed
that
they
ate
breakfast
every
morning
with
jesus
christ
now
i
wasnt
there
in
galilee
back
in
the
roman
occupation
so
i
dont
know
for
certain
that
david
koresh
was
not
jesus
christ
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
he
was
not
even
aside
from
the
fact
of
never
having
seen
them
in
a
photograph
together
by
circumventing
laws
which
were
intended
to
prevent
such
a
buildup
which
laws
are
you
making
reference
to
i
admit
i
cant
cite
a
specific
but
if
there
isnt
a
law
against
purchasing
grenade
components
and
assembling
them
into
functioning
units
then
perhaps
we
need
one
all
second
ammendment
arguments
aside
im
just
not
sure
that
i
like
the
idea
of
private
citizens
with
hand
grenades
