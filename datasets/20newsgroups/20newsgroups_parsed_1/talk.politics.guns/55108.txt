ive
seen
lots
of
notes
like
these
in
various
newspaper
classified
sections
but
then
under
hunting
or
sporting
goods
or
outdoor
or
collectors
classifications
you
see
things
like
colt
ar
hunting
rifle
or
galil
sporting
arm
stuff
like
that
the
newspaper
gets
to
make
its
editorial
statement
plus
they
get
the
revenue
anyway
