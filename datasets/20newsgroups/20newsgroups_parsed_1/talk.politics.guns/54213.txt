firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
all
production
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
firearms
from
scratch
highranking
crime
figures
could
obtain
imported
uzis
and
such
but
the
average
person
and
average
thug
would
be
lucky
to
get
a
zipgun
and
would
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
so
why
did
the
australian
customs
service
make
a
public
statement
to
a
parliamentary
committee
last
year
that
weapons
smuggling
was
a
problem
which
it
was
not
able
to
control
possibly
criminals
dont
have
your
grasp
of
economics
