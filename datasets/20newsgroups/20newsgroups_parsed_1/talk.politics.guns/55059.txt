re
dealing
with
cults
a
few
thoughts
in
article
oded

writes
look
at
history
rep
leo
ryan
and
some
staffers
visited
jonestown
at
the
request
of
constituents
who
had
relatives
there
once
jonestown
was
discovered
and
even
though
they
killed
ryan
and
his
entourage
they
all
killed
themselves
because
jim
jones
knew
hed
be
busted
the
only
way
to
prevent
such
a
problem
would
be
never
to
investigate
reports
of
child
abuse
or
sexual
mistreatment
or
organizations
buying
fullauto
conversion
kits
or
shipping
hand
grenades
via
ups
on
the
off
chance
of
stumbling
across
cults
that
would
kill
themselves
so
the
only
way
the
batffbi
could
save
those
people
and
future
cults
is
by
ignoring
such
signs
the
paucity
of
this
line
of
argument
is
that
it
is
provably
false
texas
state
officials
could
and
did
investigate
child
abuse
charges
they
could
and
did
apprehend
koresh
peaceably
the
could
and
did
impound
his
weapons
for
the
duration
and
koresh
was
not
convicted
note
that
child
abuse
and
similar
accusations
are
state
matters
not
federal
the
state
could
and
did
handle
them
properly
and
peaceably
and
furthermore
violating
no
ones
constitutional
rights
in
the
process
so
maybe
the
best
way
for
batffbi
to
save
people
is
to
mind
their
own
fucking
business
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
investors
