they
had
rocket
launchers
and
such
as
the
press
and
gov
claims
why
jkshouldnt
they
have
done
something
what
possible
use
would
a
religious
cult
jkhave
for
a
rocket
launcher
also
is
child
abuse
covered
by
the
bill
of
jkrights
this
is
taken
a
little
out
of
context
and
im
not
flaming
jasonits
just
that
this
was
the
proverbial
straw
i
grow
a
little
weary
of
the
allegations
here
the
media
people
on
the
street
that
the
bds
had
all
these
horrible
illegal
weapons
and
other
paraphenalia
of
destruction
capable
of
blowing
tanks
feet
into
the
air
and
then
without
missing
a
beat
discuss
how
the
bds
willfully
commited
mass
suicide
or
killed
their
own
less
fanatical
and
then
commited
mass
suicide
etc
etc
if
the
bds
had
all
these
things
and
intended
to
blow
up
their
abode
blow
up
waco
blow
up
the
entire
country
or
whatever
suits
your
fancy
what
happened
to
all
the
violence
they
were
supposed
to
unleash
why
wouldnt
they
have
gone
out
in
the
proverbial
blaze
of
glory
and
come
out
shooting
with
an
attitude
of
lets
take
as
many
of
those
dogs
as
possible
with
us
instead
they
seemed
to
have
preferred
death
to
whatever
they
thought
was
in
store
for
them
at
the
governments
hands
its
totally
immaterial
whether
they
were
all
crazy
all
fanatics
all
followers
of
the
antichrist
haters
of
the
government
practicers
of
weird
lifestyles
or
whateverthey
must
have
felt
that
they
were
being
pressured
into
renouncing
their
beliefs
however
how
strange
or
lunatic
those
beliefs
might
appear
to
you
and
me
there
is
much
precedent
for
such
devotion
to
cause
my
conclusion
at
this
point
is
that
the
authorities
seriously
misread
their
danger
to
society
else
why
did
the
bds
not
do
as
suggested
above
andor
chose
this
incident
to
make
some
heinous
point
or
satisfy
some
internal
agenda
up
to
and
including
ag
j
renbo
using
this
as
an
opportunity
to
assert
her
manhood
some
people
really
do
believe
it
is
better
to
die
than
be
subjected
to
what
they
perceive
as
the
godless
government
when
i
force
myself
to
not
judge
others
by
my
own
personal
standards
and
beliefs
i
can
almost
admire
their
stand
i
surely
believe
in
the
constitution
but
i
dont
know
that
i
have
such
strength
of
conviction
as
evidenced
by
the
bds
