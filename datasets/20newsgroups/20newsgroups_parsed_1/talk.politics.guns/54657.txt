writes
just
to
shed
some
light
on
the
fire
it
was
widely
reported
ap
etc
that
there
were
several
witnesses
to
bd
folks
starting
the
fires
it
has
also
been
reported
that
the
fires
broke
out
in
several
places
at
once
which
rules
out
a
bradley
knocking
over
a
lamp
etc
as
the
cause
consider
this
the
bds
had
more
than
one
lamp
the
tanks
made
more
than
one
hole
in
the
building
did
anyone
else
notice
on
the
video
that
it
appeared
that
wherever
there
was
smoke
coming
out
of
the
building
there
was
a
tank
nearby
the
fact
that
it
appears
that
fires
started
in
several
places
does
not
rule
out
anything
i
watched
it
live
and
have
rewatched
it
several
times
and
from
the
press
vantage
point
there
was
only
one
starting
point
visible
where
the
tank
punched
in
on
the
windward
side
and
the
winds
whipped
that
fire
across
the
whole
dry
wooden
structure
in
minutes
faned
by
the
mph
gusts
and
the
hueys
if
there
were
other
fires
started
they
were
not
visible
nor
were
they
needed
to
cause
the
flame
progression
i
observed
also
where
are
these
several
witnesses
the
way
i
heard
it
from
the
fbi
spokesman
on
cnn
the
witnesses
were
all
people
driving
the
tanks
all
witnesses
get
thier
paychecks
from
the
fbi
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
too
bad
nothing
will
happen
to
her
or
him
the
fbi
and
the
media
have
done
their
job
well
yep
they
media
has
endorsed
the
fbi
version
without
question
sad
