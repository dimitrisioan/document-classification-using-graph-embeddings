i
have
heard
many
opinions
on
this
subject
and
would
like
to
hear
more
from
the
people
on
the
net
say
youre
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebody
you
give
them
a
chance
to
get
away
but
they
decided
to
continue
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shooting
and
killing
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cops
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provided
of
course
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
what
kind
of
laws
are
on
the
books
regarding
this
type
of
situation
what
would
be
the
most
likely
thing
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stayed
and
waited
and
it
was
a
first
offense
what
would
happen
if
you
took
off
but
someone
saw
you
and
you
were
caught
anyone
jason
if
in
said
situation
i
would
reviewing
other
cases
ive
seen
reported
on
in
the
articles
ive
read
etc
suggest
the
safest
legal
course
of
action
is
as
follows
warn
your
assailant
loudly
and
in
clear
tones
that
you
have
a
weaponyeseven
though
its
blatantly
obvious
now
that
you
have
it
out
and
that
you
will
shoot
him
if
he
advancesdoes
not
cease
whatever
hostile
action
he
is
currently
involved
in
ie
drop
the
knife
or
ill
shoot
repeat
this
process
three
timesif
you
can
not
if
hes
pointing
a
freaking
gun
at
you
himselfthats
kinda
impractical
there
are
variables
here
and
i
will
try
to
address
them
in
turn
after
said
warning
considering
its
ignored
aim
center
mass
and
fire
until
he
drops
this
is
not
sadism
its
practicalityif
he
hasnt
gone
down
hes
still
a
threatwhy
i
support
if
he
turns
and
runs
do
not
pursue
or
fire
at
his
back
shots
fired
in
anger
will
burn
you
later
though
in
some
cases
the
i
can
see
where
that
might
not
bother
me
all
that
much
if
you
do
drop
him
remain
where
you
are
have
a
bystander
or
witnessor
create
one
by
yelling
at
the
top
of
your
lungs
call
the
police
and
wait
reholster
your
weapon
visibly
or
place
it
on
the
ground
nearby
do
not
attempt
to
recollect
your
brassthe
police
will
use
its
location
to
piece
together
the
scene
along
with
your
testimony
and
that
of
any
witnesses
mentally
mark
witnesses
if
the
police
say
that
none
came
forward
let
them
know
who
you
saw
attempt
to
keep
your
weapon
loaded
with
the
minimum
requiredhow
the
hell
can
i
phrase
this
try
to
avoid
special
purpose
ammunition
hollow
points
and
hydrashock
rounds
give
the
opposing
lawyer
the
type
of
loaded
phrasing
he
will
need
to
sawy
the
jury
that
you
fully
intended
to
kill
someone
the
only
special
purpose
rounds
that
i
can
think
of
that
would
actually
help
your
case
as
it
has
in
several
is
the
glaser
safety
slug
oh
what
a
lovely
name
safety
slug
the
stated
purpose
and
stated
design
parameters
of
the
round
are
life
savers
in
court
ie
attempting
to
create
a
bullet
which
will
not
overpenetrate
not
ricochette
and
which
is
designed
to
stop
not
kill
gee
to
bad
the
two
often
cross
damn
im
real
sorry
that
rapist
is
dead
not
an
assailant
with
one
shot
this
again
can
be
a
real
life
saver
in
a
hostile
court
be
as
cooperative
with
the
police
as
possible
show
them
where
you
were
repeat
your
information
as
often
as
requested
they
will
often
ask
you
the
same
questions
over
and
over
to
verify
facts
and
unfortunately
to
see
if
your
lying
fill
out
all
statements
and
show
all
required
identification
and
weapon
permits
booo
down
with
registered
citizensregister
your
politicians
as
deadly
tax
weapons
needing
to
be
confiscated
if
they
are
required
in
your
state
contact
a
lawyer
immediately
if
they
decide
to
hold
you
or
that
further
questioning
is
needed
if
you
can
not
afford
one
