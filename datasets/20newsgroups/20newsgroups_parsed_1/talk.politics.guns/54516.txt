you
believe
that
individuals
should
have
the
right
to
own
weapons
of
mass
destruction
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
you
would
support
a
neighbors
right
to
keep
nuclear
weapons
biological
weapons
and
nerve
gas
on
hisher
property
that
really
depends
upon
where
you
draw
the
line
while
defining
these
weapons
and
also
on
if
you
intend
the
law
to
be
reflective
of
modern
practice
five
months
or
five
centuries
down
the
road
ill
give
you
a
little
hint
see
that
manure
pile
in
the
farmers
field
down
the
road
in
the
usa
that
is
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
biological
in
nature
because
if
it
gets
washed
into
an
open
well
it
will
contaminate
the
aquifers
that
supply
thousands
of
cities
with
drinking
water
so
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
the
usa
the
epa
has
ruled
that
a
pile
of
scrap
iron
is
illegal
care
to
draw
a
thinner
line
this
time
