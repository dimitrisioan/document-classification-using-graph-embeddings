more
than
someone
who
would
not
release
children
from
the
compound
i
suppose
its
too
late
now
but
the
repeated
use
of
the
word
release
is
peculiar
lets
say
you
and
your
family
are
besieged
in
your
home

helicopters
and
automatic
weapons
they
give

release
the
children
and
theyll
be
perfectly
all
right
stipulate
on
top
