information

vincent
fox
writes
in
a
separate
post
over
on
soccultureusa
she
explicitly
said
that
while
she
crossposts
to
tpg
and
sets
followups
to
there
she
does
not
read
talkpoliticsguns
if
you
think
about
it
its
a
clever
way
of
keeping
some
of
the
politer
respondents
who
will
edit
their
newsgoup
line
or
properly
use
the
followup
from
being
heard
over
there
it
also
makes
it
easier
for
her
to
claim
all
she
ever
sees
is
squeaky
weasels
so
if
you
want
her
to
see
your
insiteful
analysis
email
it
if
you
want
to
point
out
her
flaws
in
public
make
sure
your
newsgroup
line
includes
soccultureusa
to
keep
from
flooding
scu
i
emailed
it
however
i
agree
that
its
quite
the
sneaky
trick
no
more
than
i
would
expect
however
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
