waco
questions
folks
its
time
to
start
building
some
precise
questions
to
send
to
our
federal
elected
officials
and
to
investigative
reporters
in
our
local
tv
radio
and
newprint
media
ideally
these
questions
could
be
asked
at
any
investigation
into
the
batfs
and
fbis
participation
at
the
waco
fiasco
in
hopes
of
being
resolved
and
hopefully
wake
up
the
local
news
media
that
they
are
not
getting
the
entire
truth
from
the
batf
and
fbi
my
list
is
up
to
that
are
really
nagging
at
my
gut
the
list
will
probably
grow
what
were
the
contents
of
the
original
warrant
now
sealed
that
the
batf
obtained
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
illegal
firearms
andor
ammunition
could
not
be
flushed
down
the
toilet
therefore
a
noknock
raid
could
be
ruled
out
prior
to
the
initial
assault
on
the
complex
did
a
single
batf
agent
and
accompanying
witness
without
a
contingent
of
assault
and
news
media
personnel
attempt
to
knock
on
the
door
of
the
branch
davidians
complex
and
serve
the
warrant
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
law
on
the
day
of
the
initial
assault
on
the
complex
batf
agents
were
aware
that
several
small
children
were
inside
the
buildings
in
the
ensueing
gun
battle
batf
agents
fired
into
a
building
known
to
contain
children
killing
at
least
one
twoyear
old
child
knowing
children
were
present
why
didnt
the
batf
have
an
alternate
plan
and
immediately
retreat
from
the
area
close
to
the
complex
and
implement
the
alternate
plan
rather
than
opening
fire
and
jeopardizing
the
lives
of
the
children
in
the
building
the
fbi
spokesman
states
that
paper
evidence
indicates
that
david
koresh
and
members
of
the
branch
davidians
possessed
over
in
firearms
and
ammunition
did
david
koresh
and
the
members
of
the
branch
davidians
have
a
valid
federal
firearms
license
were
they
actively
participating
in
the
legal
business
of
sellingbuying
firearms
and
ammunition
and
were
any
of
the
weapons
they
had
illegally
possessed
does
this
paper
evidence
consist
only
of
weapons
purchased
or
does
it
include
legally
dispossessed
weapons
after
the
original
assault
on
the
compound
tragically
failed
a
batf
spokeswoman
stated
we
were
outgunned
yet
tv
newscasts
of
video
tape
filmed
at
the
time
of
the
incident
show
batf
agents
armed
with
mp
and
arm
rifles
although
unclear
on
the
video
tape
because
of
obstruction
from
full
view
by
agents
bodies
they
also
may
have
had
ak
and
sks
rifles
what
types
of
firearms
did
the
batf
agents
have
immediate
access
to
at
the
scene
of
the
original
assault
on
the
complex
since
there
is
no
evidence
to
confirm
anyone
was
inside
the
complex
involuntarily
why
did
the
fbi
treat
it
as
a
hostage
situation
along
the
same
lines
why
did
the
fbi
use
psychological
warfare
techniques
including
sensory
overload
sleep
deprivation
and
other
disruptive
techniques
that
would
test
the
sanity
of
any
normal
person
rather
than
using
techniques
aimed
at
placing
the
complex
occupants
into
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
reports
indicate
several
of
the
children
inside
the
complex
were
accompanied
by
their
mothers
since
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
these
mothers
would
have
their
children
taken
away
from
them
if
they
came
out
why
did
the
fbi
expect
the
mothers
to
just
walk
out
and
surrender
themselves
to
the
authorities
agents
at
the
scene
claim
to
have
seen
members
of
the
branch
davidians
setting
fire
to
the
complex
branch
davidian
members
who
survived
the
inferno
claim
the
fire
was
started
when
an
armored
vehicle
punched
through
the
wall
and
knocked
over
a
lantern
which
was
setting
on
a
table
video
tape
of
the
incident
does
show
an
armored
vehicle
punching
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
the
fire
erupted
almost
immediately
from
the
same
general
location
was
the
source
of
the
fire
the
same
room
where
the
armored
vehicle
penetrated
fbi
spokesmen
are
voicing
the
opinion
that
the
david
koresh
and
the
members
of
the
branch
davidians
committed
mass
suicide
yet
bodies
are
being
discovered
throughout
the
house
and
other
areas
within
the
building
complex
this
seems
to
be
counter
to
any
known
mass
suicides
through
history
what
evidence
does
the
fbi
have
that
a
mass
suicide
pact
existed
fbi
director
sessions
stated
that
the
massive
fireball
shown
on
the
video
tape
was
caused
by
the
branch
davidians
ammunition
andor
powder
cache
exploding
yet
the
fireball
seems
to
be
more
characteristic
of
the
type
created
when
compressed
gas
or
other
highly
volatile
fuel
source
explodes
was
any
evidence
found
which
would
indicate
the
branch
davidians
had
an
ammunition
andor
powder
cache
which
exploded
to
create
this
fireball
if
so
and
if
david
koresh
and
members
of
the
branch
davidians
were
engaged
in
the
legal
business
of
sellingbuying
firearms
was
the
amount
determined
to
be
excessively
greater
than
one
would
expect
for
someone
engaged
in
such
a
legal
business
it
is
rumored
that
one
fbi
agent
was
extremely
upset
about
critical
news
media
coverage
and
intentionally
used
an
armored
vehicle
to
crush
a
reporters
car
which
had
been
left
at
the
compound
is
there
any
factual
basis
to
this
rumor
and
if
so
what
charges
will
be
brought
against
the
fbi
agent
who
performed
the
act
fbi
director
sessions
states
that
during
the
final
assault
on
the
complex
over
shots
were
fired
at
the
vehicles
on
the
video
tape
of
the
incident
you
can
hear
the
drone
of
the
armored
vehicles
engines
yet
there
is
no
sound
of
the
sharp
reports
that
one
would
expect
to
hear
if
shots
were
fired
also
there
are
no
indications
of
smoke
andor
muzzle
flashes
appearing
from
the
windows
buildings
or
other
structures
in
the
video
surely
these
should
be
evident
if
the
branch
davidians
had
fired
on
the
armored
vehicles
finally
the
video
tape
does
not
show
any
indication
of
paint
splatter
sparks
or
other
characteristic
spray
of
material
which
should
be
apparent
if
the
branch
davidians
had
fired
upon
the
vehicles
do
any
of
the
armored
vehicles
which
were
brought
in
to
pump
tear
gas
into
the
compound
show
evidence
of
fresh
damage
due
to
being
hit
by
shots
from
highpower
rifles
cs
gas
is
considered
to
be
a
chemical
warfare
agent
the
united
states
has
signed
international
treaties
which
prevent
the
use
of
cs
gas
in
warfare
if
the
united
states
could
not
morally
use
cs
gas
against
saddam
hussein
and
his
troops
why
is
it
morally
acceptable
to
use
the
same
agent
against
citizens
of
our
own
land
on
april
fbi
spokesmen
state
that
at
least
bodies
discovered
in
the
complex
had
bullet
wounds
to
the
head
indicating
they
had
been
murdered
or
had
committed
suicide
on
april
the
county
coroner
claims
he
knows
nothing
about
any
bodies
found
with
bullet
wounds
to
the
head
were
any
of
the
victims
bodies
found
within
the
burned
out
complex
have
bullet
wounds
to
the
head
