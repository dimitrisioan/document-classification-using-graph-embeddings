though
i
agree
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
guns
i
note
in
passing
that
a
number
of
gun
apologists
seem
to
have
ignored
the
words
well
regulated
in
their
distorted
interpretations
of
the
second
amendment
well
regulated
at
the
time
of
its
writing
and
in
the
context
of
the
second
amendment
means
properly
trained
and
equipped
it
modern
language
it
would
read
a
properly
trained
and
equipped
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
note
the
word
free
it
doesnt
say
police
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
