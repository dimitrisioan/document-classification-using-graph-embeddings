feds
caught
in
another
lie

writes
well
after
days
of
hearing
that
of
the
bd
bodies
had
been
shot
in
the
head
horrors
another
jonestown
crazed
cultists
child
abusers
whackos
in
waco
last
night
the
medical
examiner
was
on
tv
and
was
pretty
vehement
in
denying
that
any
of
them
had
bullet
wounds
he
seemed
just
a
tad
upset
at
the
feds
for
having
spread
that
rumor
aw
gee
he
shouldnt
be
so
hard
on
them
theyre
just
practicing
the
new
principle
of
flexible
reality
that
their
big
boss
has
implemented
before
long
i
think
all
the
kneejerk
government
apologists
are
going
to
start
getting
pretty
pissed
off
at
how
easily
they
were
misled
two
notes
of
interest
from
texas
the
tarrant
couonty
me
who
is
doing
the
autopsies
is
well
known
for
rendering
judgements
that
are
contrary
to
the
police
view
he
presented
evidence
a
few
years
ago
that
a
man
who
police
said
was
pointing
a
gun
at
them
actually
had
his
hands
in
the
air
this
does
not
bode
well
for
the
boys
in
black
the
texas
dept
of
public
saftey
and
the
texas
rangers
have
no
great
love
for
the
atf
i
have
heard
them
referred
to
as
those
fucking
cowboys
the
dps
was
totally
squeezed
out
of
the
bd
operation
and
resented
being
left
as
traffic
cops
atf
now
has
two
strikes
against
them
finally
i
guess
that
makes
three
notes
rumour
from
waco
is
that
four
atf
agents
were
stopped
by
four
waco
police
cars
and
a
dps
trooper
after
one
of
the
flashed
an
automatic
weapon
at
a
cop
lots
of
pissed
of
cops
and
you
wonder
why
there
were
so
few
cops
really
cheering
on
the
atf
dillon
pyron
the
opinions
expressed
are
those
of
the
tidseg
lewisville
vax
support
sender
unless
otherwise
stated
when
im
here
when
im
home
texans
vote
no

we
need
solutions
not
gestures
