not

had

denatured
cooked

a

bodies

medical
examiners
tend

like
cleaning
up
such

as
such
if
the
body
had
been
suitably
cooked
a
bullet
comming
from
a
magazine
explosion
would
more
than
likely
have
enough
force
to
enter
and
thus
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
a
bullet
entered
at
the
time
of
death
or
much
later
unless
you
were
trained
to
look

texas
rangers

not
pathologists
pvasilion
this
is
quite
corect
but
a
bullet
hitting
a
burned
body
with
little
energy
will
show
virtually
no
deformation
ie
a
hollow
point
probably
would
not
expand
an
fmj
would
be
pristene
also
the
bullets
will
not
be
marked
with
the
lands
ang
grooves
of
a
barrel
because
they
didnt
come
out
of
one
a
good
pathologist
should
be
able
to
notice
this
right
away
let
us
hope
that
the
mes
that
handle
these
bodies
are
more
competent
then
the
ones
who
did

the

fire
victims
apparently
are
usually
found
face
down
suggesting
they
died
prior
to
the
fire
the
me
says
in

bullshit
the
victims
were
face
down
the
fbi
says
they
sent
a
body
of
a
victim
that
was
shot
supposedly
by
bd
guards
the
me
says
in
a
word
bullshit
the
body
showed
no
evidence
of
gunshot

can
the
