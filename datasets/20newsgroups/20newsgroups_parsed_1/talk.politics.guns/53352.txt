i
dont
know
how
anyone
can
state
that
gun
control
could
have
no
effect
on
homicide
rates
there
were
over
accidental
handgun
homicides
in
america
in
most
with
licensed
weapons
more
american
children
accidentally
shot
other
children
last
year
than
all
the
handgun
homicides
in
great
britain
source
national
safety
council
please
no
dictionary
arguments
about
rates
vs
total
numbers
okay
theyre
offered
for
emphasis
not
comparison
youre
a
great
debater
you
chose
your
sources
of
information
claim
them
to
be
superior
im
not
aware
of
using
any
numbers
from
the
ozone
unless
you
consider
those
i
got
from
you
to
be
such
ive
made
no
such
claim
please
direct
my
attention
towards
any
posting
of
mine
where
i
claimed
superior
sources
of
information
its
probably
because
i
bothered
to
post
any
references
at
all
while
others
seem
content
to
post
numbers
pulled
from
the
ozone
that
youve
confused
it
with
facttwisting
if
so
i
apologize
yes
you
state
the
reference
and
then
you
claim
its
a
good
or
fair
treatment
then
take
those
twisted
numbers
and
twist
them
further
by
trying
well
then
heres
fair
opportunity
for
you
to
prove
that
ive
twisted
numbers
on
what
grounds
do
you
contradict
those
references
do
you
have
any
citations
any
sources
of
your
own
that
i
can
take
similar
gratuitous
shots
at
you
fail
to
see
the
differences
between
absolute
numbers
and
rates
to
compare
absolute
numbers
between
two
countries
that
have
major
population
differences
the
usa
and
gb
and
then
whine
that
you
are
afraid
someone
might
attack
your
process
and
so
claim
the
numbers
are
for
emphasis
not
comparison
emphasis
of
what
nitpicking
and
scolding
is
a
whiney
debating
style
jim
no
you
just
miss
the
point
by
your
methods
i
can
prove
gun
control
to
be
a
total
failure
new
yorks
total
homocide
count
with
its
strict
gun
control
is
much
higher
than
rhode
islands
with
its
less
strict
gun
control
far
more
folks
are
killed
in
new
york
than
rhode
island
therefore
according
to
mane
logictm
gun
control
has
made
new
york
a
much
more
dangerous
place
than
rhode
island
remember
its
nitpicking
and
a
whiney
debating
style
to
point
out
the
differences
between
new
york
and
rhode
island
that
might
defeat
my
argument
anything
else
is
blowing
smoke
you
seddit
brudda
now
you
agree
wow
a
breakthrough
