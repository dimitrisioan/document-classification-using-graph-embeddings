censorship
the
newspapers
have
now
decided
to
censor
gun
ads
which
is
why
you
no
longer
see
the
ads
that
traders
san
leandro
has
run
for
many
years
if
you
are
tired
of
newspapers
who
run
sex
and
liquor
ads
galor
yet
refuse
to
run
legitimate
gun
ads
please
send
a
letter
to
the
editors
indicating
your
displeasure
over
their
censorship
doctrine

i
have
the
april
issue
of
the
sf
chronicle
in
my
lap
page
e
in
the
sporting
green
section
has
a
traders
advert
the
copy
is
a
bit
screwed
up
it
says
that
the
prices
offered
expire
but
the
ad
is
there
the
sf
examiner
and
chronicle
run
the
same
set
of
adverts
because
they
have
a
joint
printingbiz
agreement
and
differ
only
in
editorial
content
ive
seen
gun
ads
recently
in
the
merc
which
is
antigun
editorially
albeit
not
from
traders
but
from
its
competitors
i
dont
know
about
the
other
papers
does
traders
claim
that
things
are
changing
when
why
tv
journalists
lie
because
its
easier
than
telling
the
truth
and
no
one
much
cares
either
way
let
me
know
if
you
write
to
any
of
these
bozos
before
you
do
make
sure
that
the
bozos
are
actually
doing
what
youre
accusing
them
