the
rest
of
us
fall
in
the
middle
there
is
too
much
violent
crime
in
the
us
but
turning
the
whole
country
into
an
oldtime
dodge
city
ref
to
american
old
west
is
not
the
way
thats
an
interesting
statement
theres
quite
a
difference
between
hollywoods
old
west
and
the
real
one
yes
there
were
drunks
saloons
mining
camps
and
thugs
however
as
mcgrath
showed
the
thugs
preyed
almost
exclusively
on
one
another
mcgrath
claims
that
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
no
one
much
cared
if
someone
who
insisted
on
getting
into
a
fight
got
his
way
even
if
he
lost
while
they
really
did
care
when
thugs
preyed
on
others
citizens
should
be
able
to
own
weapons
but
we
see
no
sense
in
some
types
we
havent
figured
out
that
those
distinctions
dont
actually
work
machine
guns
have
been
strictly
regulated
since
said
regulation
is
both
perfect
legally
owned
machine
guns
arent
ever
used
criminally
and
a
complete
waste
of
time
the
criminal
use
of
machine
guns
hasnt
change
at
all
the
result
were
now
arguing
about
guns
that
look
like
machine
guns
but
are
no
different
than
other
guns
