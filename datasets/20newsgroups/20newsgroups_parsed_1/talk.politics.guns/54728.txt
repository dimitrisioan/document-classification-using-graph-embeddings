something
like
of
guns
used
in
crime
in
the
us
are
purchased
from
legitimate
dealers
and
not
necessarily
by
the
person
who
used
them
in
the
crime
so
we
already
have
that
much
gun
control
ive
seen
this
mentioned
a
number
of
times
im
curious
what
is
the
source
for
this
statistic
the
number
bounces
between
and
depending
on
the
study
quoted
and
the
type
of
gun
being
studied
some
cites
a
recent
batf
study
titled
protecting
america
yes
surveyed
career
criminals
and
found
that
only
of
guns
used
in
violent
crimes
were
purchased
from

dealers

by

the
basic
problem
with
waiting
periods
is
shown
by
a
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco

firearms
study
of
gun
dealer
sales
in
des
moines
and
greenville
the
study
found
that
about
one
to
two
percent
of
sales
were
to
dangerous
criminals
in
short
waiting
periods
have
no
statistically
noticeable
impact
on
any
type
of
crime
because
only
a
tiny
fraction
of

guns
are
purchased
at

testimony
before
congress
revealed
that
most
assault
weapons
in
the
hands
of
criminals
were
obtained
through
illegal
channels
the
testimony
is
consistent
with
the
national
institute
of
justices
research
findings
based
on
studies
of
felons
in
state
prisons
the
nu
study
authored
by
sociologists
james
d
wright
and
peter
rossi
found
that
only
sixteen
percent
of
criminals
had
obtained
their
most
recent
handgun
from
a
gun
store
the
figures
included
purchases
by
legal
surrogates
rather
than
directly
by
the
criminal
wright
and
rossi
who
had
begun
their
research
as
firm
proponents
of
gun
control
concluded
that
no
set
of
controls
on
retail
purchases
and
probably
not
even
full
scale
gun
prohibition
would
reduce
criminal
use
of
guns
wright
and
rossi
suggested
that
lawmakers
concerned
about
gun
crime
directly
target
the
black
market
in
criminal
guns
and
leave
the
legitimate
retail
market
alone
not
surprisingly
wright
believes
that
the
consequences
of
current
assault
weapon
legislation
on
street
violence
are
likely
to
be
ineffective
he
warns
that
gun
controls
aimed
at
ordinary
citizens
are
less
likely
to
reduce
the
pool
of
criminal
guns
than
to
provide
organized
crime

lucrative
