id
appreciate
any
help
anyone
could
give
me
on
these
two
questions
the
brady
bill
was
in
the
news
throughout
but
what
actually
happened
to
it
in
congress
did
bush
veto
it
if
so
when
the
brady
bill
passed
the
house
in
but
failed
to
reach
a
vote
in
the
senate
as
such
it
never
reached
bush
sarah
bradys
condemnation
notwithstanding
itll
probably
pass
the
house
again
and
will
probably
pass
the
senate
if
they
can
get
it
to
a
vote
whether
of
not
theyll
be
busy
with
other
things
will
be
the
question
i
dont
expect
gungho
opposition
on
the
part
of
senate
republicans
since
they
wont
want
to
overuse
their
fillibuster
trump
card

i
still
remember
the
way
you
laughed
when
you
pushed
me
down
the
elevator
shaft
sometimes
i
get
to
thinking
you
dont
love
me
anymore
