murders
almost
everyone
in
waco
today
its
truly
unfortunate
that
we
dont
have
the
japanese
tradition
of
harikari
for
public
officials
to
salvage
some
tatters
of
honor
after
they
commit
offenses
against
humanity
like
were
perpetrated
in
waco
texas
today

im
beginning
to
look
forward
to
reaching
the
allocation
of
taxes
to
pay
for
the
interest
on
the
national
debt
at
that
point
the
federal
government
will
be
will
go
out
of
business
for
lack
of
funds
