however
havent
we
already
lost
our
right
to
bear
arms
it
seems
that
in
most
states
like
texas
a
citizen
may
own
a
gun
and
carry
while
at
his
home
or
business
but
a
citizen
is
severely
restricted
from
bearing
outside
these
areas
here
in
texas
you
can
not
carry
in
your
car
except
when
traveling
which
is
usually
defined
as
traveling
across
a
county
line
how
did
this
come
about
are
there
any
court
rulings
on
the
legality
of
restricting
the
carrying
of
a
weapon
outside
the
home
in
texas
it
is
legal
to
carry
handguns
while
traveling
and
also
to
and
from
sporting
activities
chapter
of
the
texas
state
penal
code
does
not
restrict
long
guns
therefore
it
is
legal
to
carry
and
transport
long
guns
any
place
in
texas
