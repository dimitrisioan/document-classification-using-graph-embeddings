what
to
do
if
you
shoot
somebody

say
youre
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebody
you
give
them
a
chance
to
get
away
but
they
decided
to
continue
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shooting
and
killing
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cops
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provided
of
course
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
for
me
it
would
be
an
obvious
choice
armed
selfdefence
is
clearly
and
strongly
protected
by
the
colorado
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
state
in
the
very
clearcut
situation
of
your
hypothetical
i
wouldnt
have
anything
to
fear
from
the
police
unless
i
had
been
publicly
carrying
the
weapon
concealed
something
im
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
even
then
the
worst
id
have
to
deal
with
was
a
class
misdemeanor
even
if
the
situation
were
not
so
clear
and
i
might
have
to
worry
about
arrest
for
manslaughter
or
homicide
it
would
still
be
safer
to
wait
for
the
police
if
i
were
to
leave
and
try
to
avoid
police
involvement
id
be
committing
several
felonies
and
ruining
my
chances
of
claiming
selfdefence
in
court
if
it
really
was
selfdefence
the
prosecuter
would
ask
why
did
you
run
away
and
hide
from
the
police
in
other
states
however
this
decision
might
not
be
so
clearcut
if
someone
in
say
washington
dc
were
to
use
a
gun
in
selfdefence
he
would
automatically
be
guilty
of
several
felony
violations
of
that
citys
gun
control
laws
such
a
persons
choices
would
be
between
certain
conviction
for
a
couple
of
felonies
versus
possible
conviction
for
half
a
dozen
