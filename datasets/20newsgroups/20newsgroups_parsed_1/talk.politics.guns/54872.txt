of
the

to
be
a
universal
preexisting
right
howsomever
all
we
had
to
worry
about
was
the
shotgun
and

need
to
spend
some
time
in
a
library

was
written
in
addition
to
the
muzzleloading
shotgun
and
pistol

rifles
in
calibers
ranging
from
around

various
different

from
something
that
may

may
not
be
an
uzi
semi
or
fullauto
just
because

be
forever
until
the
root
conditions
that
justified
it
go
away
criminal
behavior
either
private
or
government
which
should
be
defended
against
theres
no
reason
it
should
go
away

none
left
