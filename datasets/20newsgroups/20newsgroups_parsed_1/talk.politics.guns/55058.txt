should

lines
for
the
moment
forget
about
batf
incompetence
or
fbi
hubris
did
anybody
catch
rep
charles
shumer
on
the
news
last
night
holding
up
a
bmg
cartridge
and
rhetorically
asking
if
anybody
should
be
allowed
to
own
one
of
these
i
presume
he
meant
the
rifle
for
which
it
is
chambered
and
not
the
cartridge
which
you
can
get
for
a
buck
so
whats
your
guess
for
the
upcoming
antigun
agenda
a
ban
on
heavy
caliber
rifles
read
bmg
a
ban
on
sniper
rifles
a
ban
on
stockpiling
guns
and
ammunition
btw
shumer
is
perhaps
the
most
misinformed
congressman
i
have
seen
on
the
news
i
wonder
how
he
finds
the
floor
in
the
morning
michael
f
gordon
vote
as
you
shot
th
cent
republican
campaign
slogan
shumer
is
not
misinformed
he
knows
full
well
what
he
is
doing
if
you
look
at
his
other
votes
and
positions
as
an
agent
of
redistribution
of
wealth
property
in
this
country
to
him
guns
and
personal
freedom
are
incompatible
with
his
obvious
worldview
they
are
a
threat
to
the
order
he
would
impose
r
it
collectivism
vs
individualism
is
an
ancient
conflict
men
have
come
close
to
the
truth
but
it
was
destroyed
each
time
and
one
civilization
fell
after
another
civilization
is
the
progress
toward
a
society
of
privacy
the
savages
whole
existence
is
public
ruled
by
the
laws
of
his
tribe
civilization
is
the
process
of
setting
man
free
from
men

i
dont
speak
for
my
company
we
hire
the
politically
correct
to
do
that
