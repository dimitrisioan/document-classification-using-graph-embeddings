writes
as
someone
else
has
pointed
out
why
would
the
stove
be
in
use
on
a
warm
day
in
texas
do
you
eat
all
your
food
cold
minor
quibble
the
assualt
and
it
was
one
began
near
dawn
the
fire
did
not
break
out
for
several
hours
i
find
it
highly
unlikely
that
the
bd
would
be
cooking
lunch
while
armored
vehicles
punch
holes
in
their
house
and
are
pumping
in
tear
gas
look
i
dont
want
to
bore
everybody
here
with
the
physics
of
woodstoves
but
theyre
not
anything
like
your
caloric
gas
range
it
takes
about
three
hours
for
a
woodstove
to
get
hot
enough
to
cook
on
and
afterwards
you
cant
just
shut
it
off
it
will
contain
hot
embers
for
over
hours
even
after
you
choke
it
completely
so
it
aint
exactly
light
up
the
stove
and
cook
me
a
batch
of
them
pancakes
aunt
j
if
you
use
a
woodstove
for
cooking
or
even
for
heating
your
house
at
night
you
will
have
it
lit
to
some
extent
all
the
time
trust
me
on
this
one
i
speak
from
experience
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
