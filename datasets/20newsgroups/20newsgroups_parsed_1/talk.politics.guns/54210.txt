subject
re
my
gun
is
like
my
in
article
writes
what
all
you
turkey
propistol
and
automatic
weapons
fanatics
dont
seem
to
realize
is
that
the
rest
of
us
laugh
at
you
you
dont
make
me
angry
you
just
make
me
chuckle
i
remeber
being
in
bellingham
washington
and
seeing
a
warning
flammage
to
follow
ah
that
british
sense
of
humor
probably
got
a
real
gutbuster
going
when
the
ira
blew
that
kid
up
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
huh
of
course
in
britain
your
government
has
ordered
you
defenseless
so
your
way
of
coping
with
violent
criminals
is
to
laugh
at
victims
pickup
truck
in
front
of
the
car
that
my
friend
and
i
were
in
it
had
a
bumper
sticker
proclaiming
gun
control
is
a
firm
grip
on
a
now
im
sure
that
that
wanker
thought
he
was
pretty
cool
i
dont
know
about
a
my
own
preference
is
for
mm
what
he
didnt
realize
was
that
we
took
a
photo
of
the
back
of
his
truck
and
showed
it
to
our
friends
when
we
got
back
to
vancouver
canada
where
im
from
originally
people
were
guffawing
at
the
basic
stupidity
of
such
a
sticker
and
the
even
greater
stupidity
of
the
person
who
put
it
there
in
the
first
place
ah
canada
where
the
criminals
dont
bother
with
checking
to
see
if
the
victims
are
home
they
just
break
on
in
americas
a
little
different
you
see
criminals
worry
a
bit
more
about
getting
shot
so
they
more
frequently
check
to
see
if
anyones
home
i
knew
somebody
else
who
went
to
one
of
your
gunmart
superstore
places
just
so
he
could
experience
the
sight
of
people
putting
guns
and
ammo
into
shopping
carts
i
didnt
believe
it
myself
until
i
drove
by
one
in
vegas
last
year
ive
heard
gun
world
in
phoenix
arizona
is
fantastic
im
hoping
to
visit
there
myself
soon
now
that
i
live
in
britain
i
can
see
how
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
perceives
you
gunnut
morons
the
bbc
recently
referred
to
the
american
penchant
for
pistols
automatic
weaponsetc
very
appropriately
it
was
called
a
national
eccentricity
ah
britain
again
isnt
that
the
place
where
youre
guilty
until
proven
innocent
tell
me
mr
didnt
britain
come
begging
to
us
gun
nut
morons
in
the
early
s
for
guns
to
defend
yourselves
against
hitler
seems
as
though
your
supposedly
enlightened
government
had
disarmed
you
aw
chaps
you
can
jolly
give
up
your
guns
if
that
hitler
man
starts
to
threaten
we
can
always
hit
up
the
yanks
for
a
few
guns
theyve
got
a
bloody
eccentric
habit
about
those
guns
you
know
just
hand
in
your
shotgun
thats
it
thank
you
the
only
problem
is
that
canada
i
hear
is
suffering
from
your
national
eccentricity
in
that
easy
to
purchase
weapons
are
being
smuggled
cross
the
border
aint
it
just
amazing
how
those
black
markets
work
damn
if
those
drugs
from
south
america
keep
coming
over
our
borders
too
even
though
weve
banned
them
guess
we
might
as
well
legalize
them
makes
you
want
to
send
fifty
bucks
to
the
libertarian
party
just
thinking
about
it
doesnt
it
anyway
all
you
gun
nut
rush
limbaugh
fans
please
keep
up
your
diatribes
against
brady
and
other
evil
liberal
media
plots
you
re
so
damn
funny
you
provide
endless
amounts
of
entertainment
in
your
arguments
and
examples
of
why
someone
should
be
allowed
to
carry
a
piece
keep
us
all
chuckling
your
closeminded
ignorance
is
without
parallel
i
guess
thats
what
happens
when
youre
raised
as
a
subject
without
rights
your
type
gravitates
to
those
who
desire
to
hold
power
over
you
hell
i
miss
those
nra
ads
with
gerald
mcrainey
now
that
im
over
here
those
were
like
monty
python
sketches
just
chuckle
as
the
cops
beat
you
senseless
to
get
a
confession
just
laugh
yourself
silly
when
you
find
that
confession
is
valid
in
court
hey
mate
this
is
justice
british
style
drew
brought
into
your
terminal
from
the
free
state
of
idaho
