what
happened
in
waco
is
not
the
fault
of
the
batf
if
they
would
of
had
the
proper
equipment
and
personal
then
they
could
of
captured
the
with
the
wod
and
the
increased
crime
in
the
streets
the
batf
is
needed
more
now
then
ever
if
they
blast
away
a
few
good
fokes
then
that
is
with
the
arms
build
up
in
waco
they
needed
to
hit
that
compound
with
mega
fire
power
they
could
of
gone
in
there
blasting
and
killed
a
few
i
hope
this
is
a
joke
if
not
heres
my
response
the
batf
has
a
history
of
noknock
raids
with
poor
evidence
often
resulting
in
innocent
people
being
killed
or
suffering
injury
to
person
or
property
i
will
not
support
the
batf
until
they
clean
up
their
act
maybe
as
to
equipment
the
batf
has
damn
near
anything
it
wants
their
faults
were
in
intelligence
military
and
civilian
definitions
apply
tactics
attacking
during
daylight
methodology
the
fbi
stated
that
it
is
against
government
policy
to
assault
a
position
where
there
are
noncombatantspotential
hostages
without
attempting
negotiations
first
and
legality
the
batfs
jurisdiction
is
taxes
on
firearms
and
tobacco
they
are
a
branch
of
the
department
of
the
treasury
they
have
very
curiously
backed
away
from
their
claims
of
illegal
weaponry
to
push
the
childabuse
charges
the
batf
has
no
jurisdiction
over
nonfirearmstobacco
issues
and
the
charges
of
childabuse
had
been
investigated
in
the
past
with
no
violence
and
no
validation
this
was
a
clear
case
of
first
the
batf
then
the
fbi
having
watched
too
many
rambo
movies
my
opinion
is
that
the
agent
in
charge
should
be
charged
with
executing
an
illegal
raid
criminal
negligence
murder
civil
rights
violations
and
breaking
hisher
oath
to
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
us
the
warrant
should
be
unsealed
to
reveal
to
the
public
what
justification
the
batf
thought
it
had
in
committing
an
armed
assault
on
american
citizens
and
while
on
the
issue
of
investigating
this
issue
the
randy
weaver
case
and
the
johnny
lawmaster
case
should
be
investigated
for
batf
wrongdoing
james
btw
if
the
batf
came
busting
in
my
windows
with
concussion
grenades
you
could
damn
well
bet
i
would
return
fire
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability

in
danger
or
in
doubt

shout

rent
