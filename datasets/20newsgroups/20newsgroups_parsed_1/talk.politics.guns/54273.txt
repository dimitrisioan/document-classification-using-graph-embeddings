if
i
would
like
to
have
a
handgun
i
would
have
to
get
an
gunlicence
from
the
police
and
to
be
a
member
of
a
gunclub
the
police
would
check
my
criminal
records
for
any
serious
crimes
andor
records
of
serious
mental
diseases
now
if
a
got
my
licence
i
would
have
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
gun
club
for
months
before
i
could
collect
my
gun
so
like
what
do
you
do
during
those
six
months
to
be
active
my
town
has
a
similar
requirement
and
its
rather
stupid
before
you
can
buy
a
handgun
you
have
to
be
an
active
member
of
a
gun
club
well
how
active
can
you
be
without
a
gun
chief
most
gun
owners
feel
a
check
of
criminal
records
for
crimes
and
mental
disorders
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
it
couldnt
be
abused
by
the
government
but
every
time
this
is
proposed
there
is
always
some
trapdoor
by
which
the
government
can
deny
your
purchase
even
if
you
are
perfectly
qualified
to
own
a
gun
and
we
oppose
this
its
a
little
like
getting
a
drivers
licence
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
before
you
are
allowed
to
since
the
fatal
accident
rate
for
licensed
automobile
drivers
in
the
us
is
around
times
the
fatal
accident
rate
of
largely
unlicensed
gun
owners
id
think
twice
before
using
this
analogy
besides
the
problem
is
criminal
use
of
guns
not
accidents
there
are
about
criminal
uses
of
guns
in
the
us
every
year
but
only
accidents
i
dont
think
its
necessary
to
spend
a
lot
of
energy
making
sure
a
criminal
can
shoot
a
gun
before
he
gets
one
just
like
the
check
most
gun
owners
feel
positively
about
requiring
safety
courses
if
they
couldnt
be
abused
by
the
government
but
they
already
have
one
state
doesnt
hold
the
courses
another
doesnt
fund
them
a
third
holds
them
only
once
a
year
with
limited
attendence
to
those
with
political
connections
is
this
fair
most
criminals
accuire
guns
to
use
them
in
crimes
and
mostly
short
time
befor
the
crime
and
how
many
of
them
acquire
these
guns
from
legal
retail
outlets
how
many
are
borrowed
stolen
smuggled
bought
on
the
black
market
use
of
knives
it
is
allowed
to
cary
knifes
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
americans
think
its
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carry
it
open
in
public
rigth
some
states
allow
only
open
carry
some
allow
only
concealed
carry
some
allow
both
some
allow
both
but
require
licenses
for
concealed
carry
all
you
can
say
is
if
one
of
these
modes
has
a
clear
advantage
over
another
in
terms
of
reducing
crime
or
any
other
public
good
then
state
legislators
someplace
are
doing
exactly
the
wrong
thing
which
means
that
they
really
dont
have
any
objective
reasons
for
these
laws
other
than
their
preferences
a
bad
way
to
govern
scandinavians
are
aggressive
we
northeners
are
not
as
hotlivered
as
southeners
but
when
we
decide
to
take
action
we
do
hotlivered
i
love
that
expression
here
we
say
hotheaded
individual
vs
masses
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
others
typically
the
only
criminals
who
can
affect
the
rights
of
all
the
other
people
are
criminals
in
government
offices
the
rest
of
our
criminals
affect
the
rights
of
only
one
or
a
few
people
at
a
time
and
they
do
this
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
possession
of
a
gun
by
someone
hurts
no
one
else
it
is
when
they
do
something
violent
with
that
gun
that
the
crime
occurs
of
course
it
is
a
crime
for
a
felon
or
exfelon
to
possess
a
gun
but
we
dont
feel
it
is
right
to
treat
common
citizens
who
have
lived
good
lives
as
if
they
were
just
prefelons
waiting
to
commit
crimes
we
shouldnt
mix
weapons
and
items
that
can
serve
as
one
i
dont
understand
this
sentence
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
life
isnt
fair
i
shouldnt
need
a
fire
extinguisher
either
or
flood
and
theft
insurance
or
to
lock
the
doors
of
my
house
and
car
but
pining
for
a
better
world
wont
do
anything
to
address
what
i
have
to
do
to
live
in
this
one
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns
like
candy
some
states
do
none
of
ours
im
sure
if
you
believe
its
smartneccacery
to
have
driverslicence
why
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
guns
frankly
im
not
sure
i
know
what
good
a
drivers
license
does
anyone
either
the
people
who
drive
safely
never
use
it
and
the
people
who
drive
drunk
drive
without
it
however
a
car
is
a
good
tool
but
not
one
that
protects
my
right
to
life
i
rank
the
right
to
life
somewhere
north
of
the
right
to
travel
freely
im
not
a
pacifist
or
anti
gun
i
would
defend
my
home
loved
ones
and
country
but
i
dont
view
guns
as
neccities
or
toys
i
have
done
army
service
and
have
used
a
variaty
of
weapons
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
one
for
self
defence
or
because
they
feel
good
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
you
want
to
own
guns
personally
its
whether
or
not
you
think
that
all
people
should
be
forced
to
do
as
you
do
i
dont
have
any
problem
with
someone
who
says
they
would
never
own
a
gun
i
do
have
a
problem
with
someone
who
says
i
should
be
prevented
from
owning
one
too
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
write
today
for
my
special
investors
