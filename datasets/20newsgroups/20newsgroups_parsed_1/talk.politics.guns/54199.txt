s
brady
bill
loopholes
hi
ive
just
finished
reading
s
and
have
several
questions
about
the
brady
bills
s
and
hr
are
these
the
current
versions
of
the
brady
bill
what
is
the
status
of
these
bills
ive
heard
theyre
in
committee
how
close
is
that
to
being
made
law
s
and
hr
seem
fairly
similar
are
there
any
important
differences
i
missed
s
seems
to
have
some
serious
loopholes
a
s
doesnt
specify
an
appeals
process
to
wrongful
denial
during
the
waiting
period
other
than
a
civil
lawsuit
s
has
an
appeals
process
once
the
required
instant
background
check
system
is
established
but
not
before
b
the
police
are
explicitly
not
liable
for
mistakes
in
denyingapproving
using
existing
records
so
who
would
i
sue
in
a
above
to
have
an
inaccurate
record
corrected
c
s
includes
an
exceptiontowaitingperiod
clause
for
if
a
person
can
convince
the
local
chief
lawenforcement
officer
cleo
of
an
immediate
threat
to
his
or
her
life
or
life
of
a
household
member
but
s
doesnt
say
exactly
what
is
considered
a
threat
nor
does
it
place
a
limit
on
how
long
the
cleo
takes
to
issue
an
exception
statement
true
have
i
misunderstood
any
other
holes
with
just
s
whats
to
stop
a
person
with
a
clean
record
from
buying
guns
grinding
off
the
serial
numbers
and
selling
them
to
crooks
at
minimum
what
additional
laws
are
needed
to
prevent
this
seems
at
min
a
gun
counting
scheme
would
be
needed
eg
john
doe
owns
n
guns
so
if
s
passes
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
see
legislation
for
stricter
hardertoforge
ids
plus
national
gun
registration
justified
by
a
need
to
make
the
brady
bill
work
please
comment
im
mainly
interested
in
specific
problems
with
the
current
legislationi
dont
mean
to
start
a
general
discussion
of
the
merits
of
anyall
waitingperiod
bills
ever
proposed
marks
