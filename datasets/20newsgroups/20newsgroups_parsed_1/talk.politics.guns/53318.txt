on
the
other
hand
we
can
draw
lessons
from
neighbors
who
are
more
culturally
similar
namely
the
canadians
i
dont
think
such
a
canada
is
any
more
culturally
similar
to
the
united
states
than
england
in
terms
of
laws
regarding
individual
rights
restrictions
on
police
searches
etc
all
closely
related
to
crime
canadian
laws
parallel
englands
and
differ
greatly
from
those
of
the
united
states
in
fact
an
exhaustive
sevenyear
study
has
already
been
done
of
the
respective
crime
rates
of
vancouver
british
columbia
and
seattle
washington
cities
with
roughly
the
same
population
urban
economy
geography
and
crime
but
with
decidedly
different
approaches
to
gun
control
actually
they
do
not
have
roughly
the
same
urban
economy
and
extremely
different
ethnic
composition
over
the
sevenyear
study
homicides
occurred
in
seattle
per
vs
homicides
in
vancouver
per
after
adjustment
for
differences
in
age
and
sex
among
the
populations
the
relative
risk
of
being
a
victim
of
homicide
in
seattle
as
compared
to
vancouver
was
found
to
be
however
if
you
account
for
economic
and
ethnic
differences
the
difference
disappears
completely
seattles
minorities
are
predominatly
poor
while
vancouvers
are
middle
or
upper
class
the
rates
for
whites
in
both
cities
were
found
to
be
identicle
while
the
rate
for
poor
seattle
minorities
was
almost
three
times
as
great
as
for
the
welltodo
minorities
of
vancouver
the
pattern
seems
to
be
one
of
poverty
and
race
relations
not
one
of
gun
control
the
authors
of
the
report
also
investigated
legally
justifiable
homicides
selfdefense
only
such
homicides
occurred
during
the
sevenyear
study
of
which
were
committed
by
police
only
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefense
occurrred
that
is
a
gross
distortion
selfdefense
does
not
mean
killing
the
attacker
there
were
cases
of
civilians
killing
their
attacker
in
selfdefence
but
such
cases
represent
less
that
of
the
crimes
prevented
by
armed
selfdefence
for
every
case
you
cite
there
were
over
other
cases
of
selfdefence
where
the
crime
was
prevented
but
the
attacker
was
not
killed
by
the
way
is
the
most
conservative
possible
figure
based
on
the
national
crime
surveys
estimate
of
crimes
prevented
by
armed
selfdefence
each
year
most
other
studies
on
the
subject
put
the
figure
at
to
those
figures
would
imply
less
than
of
sucessful
selfdefences
involve
killing
the
attacker
so
more
correctly
there
over
possibly
as
many
as
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefence
only
of
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
attacker
this
is
a
significant
factor
in
comparison
to
the
homicides
if
memory
serves
homicides
make
up
approximately
of
the
violent
crimes
the
study
considered
so
the
fair
comparison
would
be
homicides
prevented
and
homicides
clearly
the
study
can
not
be
close
to
accurate
since
it
ignored
these
cases
of
selfdefence
