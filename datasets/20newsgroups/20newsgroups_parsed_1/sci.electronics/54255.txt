i
would
like
to
hook
up
some
cameras
that
were
recently
donated
to
our
local
community
cable
tv
station
which
have
sync
inputs
in
the
form
of
horizontal
and
vertical
drive
our
station
sync
is
a
black
burst
which
works
fine
with
other
boxes
with
genlock
style
inputs
can
anyone
point
me
at
a
design
article
or
whatever
showing
how
to
produce
the
horizontal
vertical
drive
signals
check
the
stations
master
sync
generator
youll
probably
find
that
it
already
has
horizontal
and
vertical
drive
outputs
that
just
arent
being
used
a
couple
of
cables
and
youre
in
business
another
possibility
is
to
find
a
genlockable
sync
generator
with
hd
and
vd
outputs
genlock
it
to
station
sync
and
then
feed
hd
and
vd
to
the
cameras
if
neither
of
these
is
possible
then
youll
have
to
build
a
sync
separator
look
at
the
circuit
diagrams
of
your
existing
sync
generators
they
probably
all
include
circuitry
that
does
what
you
want
