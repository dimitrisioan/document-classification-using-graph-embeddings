i
am
trying
to
build
a
synchronous
demodulator
and
ive
hit
a
snag
in
my
application
i
want
to
be
able
to
change
the
gain
of
an
op
amp
amplifier
from
to
controlable
via
a
digital
input
the
most
obvious
way
ive
come
up
with
is
to
use
analog
switches
to
adjust
the
gain
of
the
op
amp
the
only
analog
switch
i
have
experience
with
it
the
unfortunately
i
want
to
switch
an
ac
signal
which
goes
from
about
v
to
v
and
the
is
only
for
positive
signals
i
have
a
carrier
signal
which
varies
between
v
and
v
i
want
to
demodulate
an
input
signal
by
feeding
the
input
signal
thru
a
amp
with
a
gain
of
when
the
carrier
is
at
v
and
thru
a
amp
with
a
gain
of
when
the
carrier
is
v
the
output
is
then
low
pass
filtered
i
believe
this
is
called
lock
in
detection
as
well
as
synchronous
demodulation
look
at
the
this
is
a
triple
to
transmissiongate
analog
multiplexer
with
positive
and
negative
power
supplies
can
be
run
from
a
singleended
supply
as
well
with
dual
supplies
the
logic
inputs
still
range
from
ground
volts
to
vdd
this
is
a
neat
well
i
think
so
design
for
a
switchablepolarity
amplifier
input
opamp
output
control
x
analog
switch
gnd
all
resistors
are
equalvalue
when
the
analog
switch
is
closed
the
amp
is
invertinggainofone
with
the
switch
open
it
is
noninvertinggainofone
you
can
clean
up
the
circuit
to
trim
out
input
offset
current
if
this
hurts
the
balance
this
would
show
up
as
carrier
feedthrough
for
high
frequencies
the
slewrate
of
the
opamp
might
cause
problems
especially
if
it
isnt
symmetrical
and
it
usually
isnt

used
to

i
was

but
now
im
not
so
sure
