i
would
also
be
interested
in
the
application
here
i
work
with
a
dance
and
technology
program
and
want
to
build
something
to
track
dancers
on
a
foot
wide
stage
from
feet
away
could
make
for
some
interesting
choreography
light
and
sound
could
be
controlled
directly
by
the
position
of
a
dancer
on
stage
or
by
the
number
of
dancers
on
stage
neat
you
could
even
build
a
spotlight
that
follows
the
dancer
around
on
stage
can
you
tell
us
more
about
what
youre
doing
sounds
like
a
very
cool
program
