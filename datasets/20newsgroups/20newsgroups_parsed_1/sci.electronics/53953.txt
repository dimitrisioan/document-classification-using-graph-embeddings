re
los
angeles
freeway
traffic
reports
i
live
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
and
word
has
it
that
something
similar
is
on
its
way
here
since
we
apparently
dont
have
the
sensor
base
you
folks
have
theyre
installing
cameras
at
strategic
points
along
the
freeways
initial
tests
are
going
to
be
in
the
santa
clara
area
im
told
with
the
video
being
piped
into
a
command
center
theyre
building
somewhere
in
the
east
bay
im
not
sure
if
frame
grabbers
or
cheap
labor
will
be
used
to
interpret
the
data
but
large
multicolored
status
displays
will
show
the
various
routes
using
different
colors
to
represent
the
various
average
speeds
for
each
stretch
of
highway
an
announcer
will
sit
in
front
of
the
status
wall
and
will
relay
continuous
verbal
traffic
status
to
those
who
want
to
receive
it
theyre
apparently
also
looking
into
licensing
a
lowam
frequency
to
be
dedicated
to
providing
continuous
audio
from
this
system
in
the
mean
time
theyll
set
up
large
incandescent
display
boards
along
the
test
stretch
to
provide
commuters
with
data
on
traffic
conditions
up
ahead
my
understanding
is
that
the
system
is
subsidized
as
a
pilot
program
and
information
from
it
will
be
available
free
of
charge
perhaps
the
la
system
is
similarly
free
or
provided
at
an
obviously
subsidized
rate
read
cheap
we
also
have
the
traffic
reports
that
are
broadcast
on
the
sap
audio
channel
of
television
channels
and
these
are
verbal
reports
qualified
with
a
identification
tone
to
tell
invehicle
receivers
like
the
auto
talk
that
the
information
coming
next
is
applicable
to
a
given
area
in
la
theyre
probably
using
some
other
tv
channels
but
the
concept
is
the
same
try
setting
your
stereo
tv
or
vcr
to
receive
the
sap
audio
channel
and
go
station
jumping
to
find
out
which
one
is
broadcasting
this
information
i
believe
this
program
is
also
subsidized
making
the
invehicle
receivers
cheap
to
purchase
and
without
having
to
incur
monthly
fees
to
use
it
since
the
makers
of
these
invehicle
receivers
dont
have
to
pay
for
the
broadcast
this
may
not
be
completely
true
they
likely
have
no
investment
in
keeping
the
system
up
and
running
when
the
cal
trans
stuff
hits
the
airwaves
you
may
have
a
nifty
little
tv
audio
receiver
in
your
car
nothing
more
when
this
happens
perhaps
a
word
to
the
wise
i
think
wed
all
be
interested
in
a
summary
post
if
you
get
more
info
on
how
the
la
system
is
networked
and
paid
for
cheers
