single
chip
receiver
for
fsk
my
next
project
is
to
come
up
with
an
ifdetector
module
for
fast
to
kbsec
packet
radio
use
no
fancy
modulation
scheme
just
wide
fsk
for
use
at
or
mhz
im
a
bit
familiar
with
the
motorola
chip
but
i
wonder
if
there
are
newer
designs
that
might
work
at
higher
input
frequencies
my
goal
is
to
come
up
with
an
inexpensive
design
for
a
receiver
back
end
with
if
input
on
one
end
and
an
fsk
demondulator
on
the
other
im
particularly
interested
in
ways
to
use
a
higher
if
than
do
any
current
chips
work
up
to
say
mhz
with
internal
downconversion
so
a
normal
if
filter
can
be
used
any
suggestions
