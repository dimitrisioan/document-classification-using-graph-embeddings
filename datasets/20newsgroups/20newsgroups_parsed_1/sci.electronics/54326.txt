there
is
a

jack
at
the
end
sticking
out

so
you
need
to
connect
the
wires
im
not
sure
if
they
have
wall
jacks
in
western
europe
they
may
son
of
the
return
of
the
how
much
does
americans
know
about
the
rest
of
the
wordflamewar
anyone
well
bertil
you
might
laugh
but
in
many
places
here
in
austria
there
are
no
wall
jacks
yet
either
just
wires
sticking
out
of
the
wall
and
put
into
a
closed
often
sealed
box
as
far
as
i
remember
from
germany
it
is
a
nicely
mixed
situation
somebody
had
wires
sticking
somebody
had
jacks
on
the
other
hand
everywhere
in
bohemia
i
have
seen
wall
jacks
and
never
seen
just
wires
sticking
out
of
the
wall
and
i
thought
slovakia
was
the
same
case
well
how
much
do
scandinavians
know
about
the
rest
of
europe
