re
electronic
odometers
i
had
the
insturment
panel
go
out
in
my
car
a
lincoln
contenintal
which
is
a
digital
dash
they
replaced
the
whole
thing
with
a
dash
thank
god
it
was
under
the
warrenty
anyway
the
odometer
was
reading
the
exact
milage
from
the
old
panel
it
must
have
a
eeprom
of
some
sort
in
it
that
is
updated
seems
to
me
that
removing
the
battery
would
erase
it
but
it
doesnt
so
i
guess
they
swapped
the
nvm
chip
nonvolitile
memory
and
installed
it
in
the
new
dash
no
they
wouldnt
let
me
have
the
old
dash
to
tinker
with
wes
