the
atari
used
a
cpu
just
like
their
entire
bit
line
xe
xe
computers
as
well
as
the
game
machine
wrong
it
has
a
the
had
some
extra
asic
chips
that
were
basically
modified
graphics
chips
and
pias
for
the
joysticks
it
had
one
custome
chip
not
an
asic
in
the
sense
that
word
is
now
understood
the
tia
sometimes
known
as
the
although
most
other
manufacturers
list
that
as
the
cia
complex
interface
adapter
tia
stands
for
television
interface
adapter
and
it
handles
sound
paddles
and
the
minimal
video
hardware
the
possessed
there
was
also
a
standard
ram
io
timer
riot
plus
a
voltage
regulator
and
if
memory
serves
a
timer
thats
all
later
model
might
have
incorporated
many
of
the
chips
into
one
asci
as
the
weight
of
the
machines
and
part
count
decreased
a
lot
over
the
years
not
according
to
the
servicing
documentation
i
have
here
the
did
not
change
intenally
very
much
at
all
additionally
i
think
the
used
k
k
and
up
to
k
of
rom
for
their
games
roms
were
mapped
into
the
upper
k
of
the
s
address
space
k
and
k
games
were
fine
but
later
k
and
k
games
needed
bank
switching
atari
and
others
made
much
of
these
huge
cartridges
i
have
no
idea
how
much
ram
it
had
to
work
with
but
i
would
hazard
a
guess
of
or
k
ram
wrong
it
had
bytes
of
ram
from
the
riot
this
was
multiply
mapped
into
both
page
pseudoregisters
and
page
stack
and
also
throughout
the
bottom
k
of
memory
tia
registers
also
sat
in
this
address
space
as
bytes
of
ram
was
somewhat
limiting
some
later
cartridges
also
carried
ram
themselves
which
was
interesting
as
atari
had
provided
no
write
line
to
the
cart
this
was
managed
by
mapping
the
reads
from
ram
into
one
address
range
and
the
writes
into
another
but
all
the
time
this
scheme
ate
into
the
very
scarce
rom
address
space
