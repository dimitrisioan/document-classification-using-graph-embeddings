interfacing
questions
i
am
interfacing
some
simple
circuits
that
run
on
v
to
my
cpu
board
which
runs
at
v
the
optoisolator
is
a
n
on
the
led
side
i
put
the
signal
i
want
through
a
k
resistor
to
the
base
of
a
n
on
the
transistor
side
i
tie
my
cpu
input
line
to
the
collector
which
has
a
pullup
resistor
of
k
it
functions
ok
but
seems
very
slow
i
can
detect
pulses
that
occur
at
about
khz
but
not
much
faster
isnt
the
risefall
time
of
this
device
something
like
us
i
should
be
able
to
detect
my
target
of
khz
but
i
cant
get
khz
this
is
done
using
wirewrap
and
the
wires
going
to
the
cpu
and
to
the
test
pin
are
about
inches
long
but
im
not
doing
anything
highspeed
in
the
art
of
electronics
it
mentions
tying
the
base
of
the
phototransistor
to
ground
through
a
resistor
to
improve
the
speed
is
that
what
i
need
to
do
how
do
i
calculate
the
resistor
value
