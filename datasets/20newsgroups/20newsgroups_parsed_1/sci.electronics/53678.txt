how
hard
would
it
be
to
somehow
interface
them
to
some
of
the
popular
motorola
microcontrollers
not
hard
you
can
do
the
refreshing
and
access
cycles
by
software
but
this
hogs
most
of
the
available
cpu
cycles
on
a
lowend
controller
ive
seen
some
application
note
from
philips
that
used
one
of
their
derivatives
as
a
printer
buffer
with
up
to
mb
of
dynamic
ram
that
was
accessed
and
refreshed
with
software
bitbanging
another
alternative
would
be
to
use
one
of
those
nice
dram
controller
chips
that
create
static
ram
appearance
and
all
that
but
they
may
be
too
expensive
to
make
it
worthwhile
segmented
memory
helps
structure
software
