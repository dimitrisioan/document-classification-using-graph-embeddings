there
are
a
few
more
details
to
radar
and
some
rumors
that
are
not
true
a
common
one
is
that
two
beams
are
sent
one
reading
the
car
speed
and
one
the
ground
speed
if
this
were
true
then

would
be
murder

this
helps
flame

i
guess
the
extra
horn
thats
mounted
in
the
floor
of
some
sdpd
cars
firing
at
the
ground
at
a
shallow
angle
is
just
for
show
huh
for
calibration
they
simply
turn
off
one
horn
or
the
