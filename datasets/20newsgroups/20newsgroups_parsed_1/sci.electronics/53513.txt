re
need
help
with
car
stereo
just
a
shot
here
but
ya
never
know
i
once
bought
a
real
cheap
equalizer
power
amp
for
my
car
tape
player
at
one
of
those
motelroom
truckload
sales
and
it
sounded
great
for
a
while
that
is
then
one
channel
quit
entirely
i
opened
it
up
and
the
amplifier
chip
for
the
bad
channel
had
simply
melted
some
of
its
solder
joints
attaching
it
to
the
pcb
i
soldered
them
back
and
it
worked
fine
i
just
had
to
keep
the
volume
a
bit
lower
than
i
did
before
probably
lousy
heat
sinking
you
said
a
nice
alpine
which
im
sure
is
a
few
orders
of
mag
higher
in
quality
than
the
pos
i
had
but
the
point
is
look
inside
before
you
scrap
it
since
you
occasionally
find
something
you
can
repair
maybe
even
the
same
thing
i
found
good
luck
