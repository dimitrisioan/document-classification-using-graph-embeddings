leadacid
batteries
often
fail
from
disuse
not
being
charged
for
a
long
time
but
theres
no
way
the
concrete
floor
could
be
the
cause
of
the
problem
ditto
the
only
remote
and
i
do
say
remote
possibility
is
that
if
the
ground
was
real
cold
f
the
battery
might
freeze
an
split
but
then
it
would
probably
freeze
anyway
