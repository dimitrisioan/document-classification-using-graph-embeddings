i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
water
nuclear
stations
dont
generate
electricity
directly
from
the
reactor
they
use
the
reactor
to
generate
heat
the
heat
is
then
used
to
heat
water
just
as
in
a
conventional
oil
or
coal
station
and
the
resultant
steam
drives
the
turbines
the
cooling
towers
are
used
to
cool
the
steam
and
recondense
it
into
water
to
continue
the
cycle
