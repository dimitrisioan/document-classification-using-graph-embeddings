pink
noise
and
white
noise
are
equal
amounts
of

this

around

too
white
noise
is
random
noise
whose
energy
density
is
constant
for
a
constant
bandwidth
that
is
a
hz
wide
band
at

will
have
precisely
the

pink
noise
is
random
noise
whose
energy
density
is
constant
for
a
constant
precentage
bandwidth
thus
a
wide
band
of
noise
at
hz
whose
bandwidth
is
hz
will
contain
the
same
energy
as
a
wide
band
at

whose
bandwidth
is
hz
wide
white
noise
is
often
used
with
spectrum
analyzers
that
have
constant
bandwidths
pink
noise
is
used
with
audiotype
realtime
analyzers
whose
bandwidths
are

dependent
often
described
as
