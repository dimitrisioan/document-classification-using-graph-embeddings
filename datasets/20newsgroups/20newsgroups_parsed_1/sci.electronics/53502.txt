my
impression
its
not
an
area
ive
played
with
much
is
that
the
muchbeloved
ne
is
basically
obsolete
if
you
want
to
detect
a
khz
tone
set
a
switchedcapacitor
filter
chip
to
that
frequency
feed
your
input
to
it
and
see
if
anything
comes
out
the
other
end
the
ne
was
what
you
used
when
good
clean
bandpass
filters
were
hard
to
do
nowadays
theyre
easy
and
the
results
are
better
