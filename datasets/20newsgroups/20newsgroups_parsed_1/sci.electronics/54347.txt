im
trying
to
bring
in
bits
to
a
pc
and
would
like
to
use
interruptdriven
routines
without
buying
an
io
board
or
making
a
new
port
where
can
i
bring
in
these
bits
lpt
seems
to
have
only
a
few
inputs
but
ive
heard
rumours
that
some
lpts
have
bidirectional
lines
anybody
know
fer
sure
if
any
bid
lpts
which
boards
have
them
ill
be
running
a
new
dx
i
know
for
sure
that
the
everex
magic
io
eva
can
be
jumpered
for
a
printer
mode
or
for
a
general
purpose
bidirectional
io
mode
also
i
know
for
sure
that
the
ibm
technical
reference
says
the
following
about
the
monochrome
display
printer
adapter
and
the
ibm
parallel
printer
adapter
it
is
essential
that
the
external
device
not
try
to
pull
these
lines
referring
to
the
data
lines
to
ground
and
later
if
an
external
device
should
be
driving
data
on
these
pins
in
violation
of
usage
ground
rules
at
the
time
of
an
input
this
data
will
be
ored
with
the
latch
contents
i
will
accept
no
responsibility
if
you
incur
damages
of
any
kind
as
a
result
of
my
saying
i
do
not
know
for
sure
but
i
think
you
should
be
able
to
use
a
traditional
parallel
port
as
an
input
port
by
writing
x
to
the
data
lines
and
then
reading
from
the
data
lines
while
an
external
device
drives
them
the
input
data
will
not
be
latched
so
noise
could
make
this
infeasible
