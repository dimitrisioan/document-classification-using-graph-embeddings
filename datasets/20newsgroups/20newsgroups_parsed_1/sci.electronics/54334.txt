i
know
this
is
a
long
shot
but
does
anyone
know
what
solvent
i
should
use
to
clean
ducttape
adhesive
from
carpet
yet
another
suggestion
but
this
one
is
nontoxic
although
i
would
handle
it
like
any
other
cleaner
and
it
smells
nice
the
chemical
is
called
dlimonene
and
it
smells
like
lemon
peels
i
think
it
is
a
lemon
extract
of
some
kind
you
might
find
it
in
a
hardware
store
sold
as
a
generalpurpose
solvent
but
your
best
bet
would
be
any
bike
store
it
is
used
as
a
chaincleaning
fluid
it
works
on
sticker
glue
crayons
grease
oil
etc
its
clear
yellow
in
the
bottle
and
you
can
use
it
straight
if
you
add
water
it
changes
to
a
creamy
consistency
which
is
good
for
some
jobs
