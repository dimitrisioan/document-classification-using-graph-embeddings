can
circuits
found
in
electronics
magazines
with
no
patent
disclaimer
be
used
legally
as
subcircuits
of
a
commercial
unit
there
are
two
issues
here
copyright
and
patent
the
magazine
articles
contents
are
copyrighted
and
may
not
be
reproduced
translated
etc
without
the
copyright
holders
permission
however
this
does
not
cover
the
ideas
expressed
only
the
form
of
expression
copying
their
circuit
diagram
or
pcboard
pattern
is
copyright
infringement
but
its
unlikely
that
they
could
stretch
copyright
far
enough
to
claim
that
the
circuit
design
itself
is
copyrighted
so
long
as
you
draw
your
own
diagrams
and
lay
out
your
own
boards
copyright
shouldnt
be
an
issue
patents
are
different
the
author
does
not
have
to
give
you
any
warning
that
the
design
is
covered
by
patent
although
it
would
be
sensible
for
him
to
do
so
in
fact
its
possible
that
he
was
infringing
on
someone
elses
patent
without
realizing
it
ignorance
of
the
patented
status
is
not
a
defence
against
infringement
although
it
might
reduce
the
damages
a
court
would
award
however
unless
there
was
something
seriously
novel
about
the
circuit
almost
certainly
it
is
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
the
art
and
therefore
unpatentable
routine
engineering
is
not
patentable
patents
in
theory
cover
only
inventions
ideas
that
are
genuinely
new
caution
i
am
not
a
lawyer
consulting
a
professional
would
be
wise
if
significant
amounts
of
money
are
at
stake
all
work
is
one
mans
work
