subject
voltage
regulation
and
current
limiting
one
notsoquick
question
to
throw
out
there
for
you
guys
for
our
class
project
we
need
to
design
and
build
a
power
supply
to
the
following
specs
voltatge
adjustable
from
v
current
limited
at
a
voltage
must
stay
within
of
designated
value
for
i
from
a
ac
ripple
less
than
mv
rms
of
course
we
cant
just
use
an
adjustable
voltage
currentlimiting
regulator
chip
our
problem
is
with
the
current
limiting
ie
weve
found
stuff
to
do
the
rest
of
the
parts
of
the
circuit
what
the
supply
must
do
if
presented
with
a
load
which
would
draw
more
than
a
given
the
supply
voltage
is
reduce
the
voltage
so
that
the
current
will
equal
one
amp
thus
if
we
were
to
short
the
thing
with
the
ammeter
we
should
read
one
amp
if
we
measure
the
current
through
a
ohm
resistor
at
v
we
should
read
one
amp
and
the
output
voltage
by
necessity
must
be
v
the
only
basic
idea
we
have
seen
for
the
current
limiter
involves
a
circuit
which
will
pull
current
off
of
the
base
of
the
output
power
transistor
and
therefore
reduce
the
output
so
does
anybody
have
any
ideas
we
could
work
from
thanks
in
advance

collins
kcyey
ps
if
anybody
wants
to
flame
this
as
a
stupid
project
i
agree
fully
but
i
still
have
to
do
it
its
graded
