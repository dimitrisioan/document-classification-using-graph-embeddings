re
where
to
buy
parts
or
at
a
time
the
pricing
of
parts
reminds
me
of
something
a
chemist
once
said
to
me
a
gram
of
this
dye
costs
a
dollar
it
comes
out
of
a
liter
jar
which
also
costs
a
dollar
and
if
you
want
a
whole
barrel
of
it
that
also
costs
a
dollar
ie
they
charge
you
almost
exclusively
for
packaging
it
and
delivering
it
to
you
the
chemical
itself
in
that
particular
case
was
a
byproduct
that
cost
almost
nothing
intrinsically
