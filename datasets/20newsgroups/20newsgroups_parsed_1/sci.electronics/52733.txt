hi
there
i
am
looking
for
a
high
quality
logstereo
k
pot
for
an
audio
preamplifier
the
design
specifies
alps
rkga
k
ax
but
i
can
not
find
it
anywhere
any
suggestions
the
best
pots
around
imho
are
made
by
penny
giles
in
the
uk
their
basic
model
has
a
solid
brass
case
and
conductive
plastic
elements
matched
to
db
across
the
whole
rotation
the
downside
is
that
they
cost
upwards
of
quid
each
the
pg
pots
are
very
good
the
alps
ones
are
usually
carried
by
the
same
folks
who
run
the
audio
amateur
magazine
ill
also
recommend
the
noble
potentiometers
if
you
dont
mind
weird
metric
sizes
on
everything
