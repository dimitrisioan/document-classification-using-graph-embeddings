antenna
simulation
software
i
would
be
interested
in
hearing
from
anyone
who
knows
of
good
software
for
antenna
simulation
particularly
in
source
form
suitable
for
unix
workstations
though
good
pc
software
would
also
be
of
interest
im
aware
of
the
numerous
mininec
mutations
and
have
been
using
mn
for
some
time
now
im
primarily
interested
in
hf
vhf
and
low
uhf
mhz
designs
mostly
wire
antennas
but
for
thick
wires
and
mesh
surfaces
as
well
as
for
your
basic
thin
wire
assumption
is
anything
interesting
happening
with
nec
itself
ive
seen
a
version
that
was
mutilated
to
run
sort
of
under
microsoft
fortran
but
im
not
sure
how
many
new
and
improved
versions
of
the
code
might
be
out
there
somewhere
id
also
be
interested
in
nonnec
derivatives
the
ones
ive
seen
have
been
aimed
at
microwave
applications
but
if
there
is
something
out
there
useful
at
the
lower
frequencies
id
like
to
know
about
it
