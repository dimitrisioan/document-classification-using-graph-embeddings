im
wondering
if
i
can
tote
my
american
touch
tone
phone
around
with
me
to
sweden
and
germany
its
dc
powered
and
i
can
buy
a
special
adapter
for
that
in
europe
the
question
is
if
the
general
electronics
work
the
same
i
can
buy
a
different
wall
plug
and
refit
it
im
sure
id
have
to
but
would
that
do
the
trick
two
things
to
watch
for
in
germany
and
i
think
the
same
holds
for
sweden
only
some
of
the
connections
can
handle
tone
dialing
so
make
sure
the
phone
can
be
set
to
pulse
dialing
in
sweden
the
is
the
first
digit
and
all
other
digits
are
pushed
down
by
one
position
this
makes
dialing
and
in
the
process
converting
numbers
an
interesting
task
otherwise
it
is
technically
no
problem
to
connect
a
foreign
phone
to
either
the
german
or
swedish
phone
system
otoh
neither
you
nor
i
would
ever
try
that
as
it
is
of
course
