re
help
with
ultralong
timing
writes
i
have
a
project
that
was
drooped
in
my
lap
that
is
somewhat
a
pain
to
design
what
i
am
looking
for
is
a
stable
ultralong
solid
state
timer
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
place
this
thing
on
the
antartic
ice
shelf
and
measure
the
amount
of
snow
fall
over
a
period
of
six
weeks
every
two
weeks
they
want
to
trip
a
selonoid
to
discharge
different
colored
pellets
by
gas
pressure
out
across
the
snow
then
by
digging
down
into
the
snow
the
snow
fall
amount
can
be
measured
as
they
come
to
the
different
color
pellets
the
problem
is
trying
to
build
a
timer
that
would
stand
the
cold
degrees
and
a
power
source
that
wouldnt
drain
i
have
looked
at
the
xr
timers
and
the
standard
ne
dual
timers
but
thier
temp
specs
wont
go
that
low
also
two
weeks
equates
to
seconds
per
firing
which
means
one
big
timing
cap
i
have
found
farad
yes
farad
caps
that
have
a
working
voltage
of
volts
and
are
small
in
size
why
are
you
fooling
around
with
analog
for
this
job
a
single
chip
micro
and
a
crystal
will
do
the
job
reliably
and
easily
an
only
costs
about
that
and
a
crystal
and
youre
in
business
embed
the
whole
thing
in
a
foam
insulated
blanket
power
it
from
a
solar
cell
use
the
excess
power
to
heat
the
assembly
during
the
day
and
rely
on
the
insulation
to
hold
the
heat
during
darkness
if
you
dont
want
to
try
thermal
management
contact
someone
like
icl
and
have
them
cut
you
a
special
low
temperature
crystal
itll
cost
at
most
if
you
use
a
single
chip
micro
youre
looking
at
a
parts
count
of
maybe
a
processor
a
crystal
two
caps
on
the
crystal
a
power
fet
to
fire
the
solenoid
a
flyback
diode
and
a
battery
this
is
fewer
parts
than
you
can
build
an
analog
timer
for
and
is
infinitely
more
reliable
add
a
power
zener
diode
for
heat
and
a
solar
cell
and
the
parts
count
screams
up
to
pd
assemblers
are
available
for
all
the
common
single
chip
micros
this
application
is
so
trivial
you
could
even
look
up
the
op
codes
in
the
programmers
guide
and
create
the
binary
with
a
hex
editor
