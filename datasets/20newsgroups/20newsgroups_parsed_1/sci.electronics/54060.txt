how
about
recradioamateurpacket
at
least
at
my
site
there
is
no
general
packet
radio
ie
nonamateur
newsgroup
that
said
i
would
definately
subscribe
to
rrapacket
if
you
want
to
learn
about
all
aspects
of
amateur
packet
radio
at
both
the
high
and
low
ends
also
i
would
get
the
faq
from
the
group
and
then
post
any
specific
questions
to
that
group
everything
i
could
tell
you
is
probably
in
the
faq
and
the
people
who
really
know
whats
going
on

seem
to
be
