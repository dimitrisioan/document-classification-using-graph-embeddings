voltage
regulator
spec

i
have
a
mac
with
a
burned
out
part
which
looks
like
a
voltage
regulator
the
part
number
is
bu
and
i
believe
the
vender
is
sgs
thomas
judging
by
teh
sgs
logo
printed
on
the
package
if
anyone
has
teh
spec
for
this
part
i
would
greatly
appreciate
an
email
with
the
import
info
so
i
can
find
a
replacement
thanx

dave
btw
i
dont
need
people
telling
me
to
throw
the
computer
away
if
i
had
the
money
the
thing
would
be
in
the
trash
in
a
second
but
it
does
make
a
good
terminal
if
nothing
else
