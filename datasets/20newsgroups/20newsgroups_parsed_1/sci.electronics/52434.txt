there
are
a
variety
of
waterproof
housings
i
could
use
but
the
real
meat
of
the
problem
is
the
electronicshence
this
posting
what
kind
of
transmission
would
be
reliable
underwater
in
murky
or
even
nighttime
conditions
im
not
sure
if
sound
is
feasible
given
the
distortion
under
waterobviously
direction
would
have
to
be
accurate
but
range
could
be
relatively
short
i
imagine
or
hundred
yards
would
be
more
than
enough
jim
mcdonald
refer
to
patents
by
james
harris
rogers
he
details
methods
of
underground
and
underwater
wireless
communications
for
a
review
refer
to
electricalexperimenter
march
and
june
rogers
methods
were
used
extensively
during
the
world
war
and
was
unclassified
after
the
war
supposedly
the
government
rethought
this
soon
after
and
rogers
was
convieniently
forgotten
the
bottom
line
is
that
all
antennas
that
are
grounded
send
half
of
their
signal
thru
the
ground
the
half
that
travels
thru
space
is
quickly
dissapated
by
the
square
of
the
distance
but
that
which
travels
thru
the
ground
does
not
disapate
at
all
furthermore
the
published
data
showed
that
when
noise
drowned
out
regular
reception
the
underground
antennas
would
recieve
virtually
noisefree
if
you
find
this
hard
to
believe
then
refer
to
the
work
of
the
man
who
invented
wireless
tesla
tesla
confirmed
that
rogers
methods
were
correct
while
hertzian
wave
theory
was
completely
abberant
et
tesla
was
years
ahead
of
his
time
perhaps
now
his
time
comes
