quiry
on
an
ad
board
ive
got
im
using
the
ad
lines
it
measures
the
voltages
properly
ie
with
a
v
power
supply
it
regs
v
and
with
v
it
regs
v
problem
is
when
ive
got
the
input
voltage
and
i
wish
to
lower
it
via
a
resistor
the
sensitivity
of
the
board
is
so
great
that
i
can
triger
it
with
holding
the
v
wire
in
one
hand
and
touch
the
probe
and
it
will
register
the
full
input
voltage
a
m
resistor
only
lowers
voltage
by
v
so
this
is
not
too
feesable
what
could
the
problems
be
and
what
else
could
i
use
to
lower
the
input
voltage
btw
ive
got
it
grounded
correctly
inspiration
comes
