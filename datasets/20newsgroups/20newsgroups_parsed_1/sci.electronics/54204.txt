well
yes
and
no
the
image
cant
be
on
the
screen
less
than
of
a
second
but
a
mixture
of
images
thats
about
of
the
field
that
was
supposed
to
be
there
and
of
the
subliminal
addition
could
be
overlaid
for
one
field
producing
the
same
overall
effect
to
our
sluggish
retinae
of
a
discrete
image
projected
for
second
this
is
a
s
idea
supposedly
splicing
in
a
frame
of
buy

at
the

talk
of
making

agreement
by

not
to
do
it

sic
at
least
in
my
rules
service
copy
of
the
rules
dated
november
since
i
dont
have
either
old
copies
of
the
federal
register
or
the
information
bulletin
around
i
cant
tell
you
what
you
cant
do
on
tv
or
radio
but
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
an
unnecisarily
hot
subject
in
the
late
s
practically
speaking
i
dont
have
too
much
trouble
seeing
the
one
frame
edits
in
mtv
promos
badly
scratched
or
torn
single
frames
in
films
and
such
but
maby
thats
just
because
the
contrast
between
the
single
frame
and
the
surrounding
material
was
significant
i
never
believed
in
the
oneframe
type
of
sp
being
real
on
the
other
hand
the
cocacola
or
brand
insert
desired
name
here
beer
cans
conveniently
placed
so
the
brand
name
is
visible
in
the
movie
you
just
watched
thats
another
story
and
if
your
tv
station
or
network
was
paid
by
the
beer
company
for
the
privilege
of
doing
that
there
has
to
be
a
promotional
consideration
paid
by
or
similar
message
included
with
the
program
but
if
the
tv
station
bought
the
movie
already
edited
that
way
from
the
film
company
and
didnt
get
any
of
the
payment
for
brand
visibility
that
the
film
company
got
then
they
dont
have
to
run
the
message
a
few
years
ago
some
junior
person
at
an
advertising
agency
reinvented
subliminal
projection
and
one
commercial
went
out
on
tape
with
singleframe
messages
it
aired
on
a
few
stations
but
a
tech
at
one
station
previewing
the
tape
noticed
a
flicker
and
looked
at
the
tape
framebyframe
to
find
the
defect
big
flap
fcc
notified
commercial

press

embarassed
ad
agency
you
could
probably
find
the
press
reports
via
dialog
or
nexis
if
you
wanted
now
that
everybody
has
vcrs
its
not
likely
that
anybody
could
get
away

this
