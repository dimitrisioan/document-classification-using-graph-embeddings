so
the
questions
are
what
do
the
radar
detector
detectors
actually
detect
would
additional
shieldinggroundingbypassing
shield
stray
rf
generated
by
a
radar
detector
or
is
the
rf
actually
being
emitted
by
the
detector
antenna
are
any
brands
quieter
than
others
ok
so
your
a
ham
well
tune
in
mhz
or
khz
these
numbers
sound
like
some
you
have
herd
before
thats
right
you
guessed
it
they
are
common
if
numbers
every
superhet
receiver
has
a
local
oscillators
which
generates
an
if
this
is
what
your
detector
detector
is
detecting
the
local
oscillator
some
of
these
have
two
or
more
local
oscillator
which
generate
more
ways
to
receiver
you
if
you
want
to
receiver
something
at
say
ghz
you
must
generate
a
local
oscillator
signal
of
ghz
mhz
your
local
osc
frequency
this
mhz
if
is
then
fed
into
a
normal
agc
ckt
the
detector
is
keyed
uppon
the
agc
voltage
your
mileage
may
vary
since
the
agc
is
a
negative
feed
back
device
a
positive
voltage
sets
off
a
i
think
you
get
the
picture
