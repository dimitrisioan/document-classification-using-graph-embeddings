break

actually
detecting
a
break
is
done
by
watching
for
a
character
containing
all
zero
bits
with
the
framing
error
resulting
from
its
receipt
this
true
enough
but
means
that
the
line
stayed
in
the
zero
bit
state
even
past
the
stop
bit
time
slot
which
basically
indicates
a
break
there
is
no
special
way
to
detect
break
that
i
have
found
other
than
this
theres
no
magic
signal
generated
by
uarts
etc

break
detect
this
is
a
very
popular
part
but
it
has
a
number
of
quirks
especially
in
hdlc
mode

break
start

break
end
detect
two
of
the
bits
in
the
receiver
status
register
you
can
enable
an
interrupt
on
either
of
these
bits
going
high
too
also
only
one
null
will
be
put
in
the
fifo
per
break
detected
this
is
simply
the
best
serial
chip
ive
ever
worked
with
many
less
quirks
than
the
scc
which
is
imho
secondbest
death

devices
