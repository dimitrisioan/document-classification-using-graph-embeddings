re
lead
acid
batteries
concrete
the
battery
goes
dead
primarily
becaust
the
floor
is
cold
the
temperature
combined
with
selfdischarge
promotes
sulfation
which
ruins
the
plates
of
the
battery
i
strongly
suspect
that
the
only
reason
the
battery
doesnt
go
dead
as
quickly
on
a
dirt
surface
is
because
cement
tends
to
be
quite
cooler
