and
current
limiting
andy

one
notsoquick
question
to
throw
out
there
for
you
guys
for
our
class
project
we
need
to
design
and
build
a
power
supply
to
the
following
specs
voltatge
adjustable
from
v
current
limited
at
a
voltage
must
stay
within
of
designated
value
for
i
from
a
ac
ripple
less
than
mv
rms
of
course
we
cant
just
use
an
adjustable
voltage
currentlimiting
regulator
chip
our
problem
is
with
the
current
limiting
ie
weve
found
stuff
to
do
the
rest
of
the
parts
of
the
circuit
what
the
supply
must
do
if
presented
with
a
load
which
would
draw
more
than
a
given
the
supply
voltage
is
reduce
the
voltage
so
that
the
current
will
equal
one
amp
thus
if
we
were
to
short
the
thing
with
the
ammeter
we
should
read
one
amp
if
we
measure
the
current
through
a
ohm
resistor
at
v
we
should
read
one
amp
and
the
output
voltage
by
necessity
must
be
v
the
only
basic
idea
we
have
seen
for
the
current
limiter
involves
a
circuit
which
will
pull
current
off
of
the
base
of
the
output
power
transistor
and
therefore
reduce
the
output
so
does
anybody
have
any
ideas
we
could
work
from
thanks
in
advance

ps
if
anybody
wants
to
flame
this
as
a
stupid
project
i
agree
fully
but
i
still
have
to
do
it
its
graded
you
can
design
for
ramp
shutoff
brickwall
current
limit
or
even
foldback
cutoffsounds
like
you
want
brickwall
current
limit
your
lead
is
correct
to
pull
down
the
bias
to
the
series
regulator
base
drive
in
order
to
get
the
brick
wall
you
need
enough
voltage
gain
on
the
current
sensor
normally
a
darlington
on
the
current
sensing
resistor
will
be
adequate
but
for
infinite
gain
use
an
op
amp
to
sense
the
current
releative
to
a
stable
voltage
reference
and
use
a
driver
to
turn
off
the
base
bias
on
the
seriespass
transistor
phase
compensation
may
be
necessary
with
this
closed
loop
control
system
if
yopu
have
more
than
degrees
phase
shift
in
your
feedabck
circuit
at
unity
gain
