re
flash
leds
with
sound
in
article
theres
a
seeker
born
every
minute
writes
would
it
be
better
to
use
a
circuit
based
on
the
volume
of
the
beeps
on
the
cassette
or
better
for
the
leds
to
respond
to
a
tone
of
a
certain
frequency
is
there
any
easy
way
to
do
either
of
these
im
looking
for
the
simplest
circuit
possible
i
guess
what
im
asking
for
is
some
sort
of
color
organ
but
not
quite
let
me
trt
to
explain
again
look
for
information
about
tone
decoder
chip
it
is
an
easy
to
use
chip
for
detecting
sound
of
certain
frequency
you
need
only
one
and
some
other
componets
for
each
led
you
want
to
control
the
chip
can
take
the
voltage
levels
which
the
casette
gives
radio
shack
archer
semiconductor
reference
guide
gives
good
information
how
to
use
that
chip
it
should
be
simplest
way
to
go
the
chip
costs
something
like
lowerys
law
if
it
jams
force
it
if
it
breaks
it
needed
replacing
anyway
