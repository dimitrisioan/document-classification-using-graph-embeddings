i
talked
to
a
friend
who
works
for
radio
shack
and
he
said
the
deal
with
the
red
batteries
were
that
they
had
too
much
lead
in
them
condidering
the
red
batteries
had
a
life
cycle
shorter
than
a
mayflies
i
think
the
epa
was
worried
about
all
those
batteries
being
dumped
out
pardon
me
but
why
would
carbonzinc
cells
have
any
lead
in
them
at
all
