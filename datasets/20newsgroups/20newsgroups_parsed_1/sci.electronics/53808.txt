situation
i
have
a
phone
jack
mounted
on
a
wall
i
dont
know
the
number
of
the
line
and
i
dont
want
to
call
up
the
operator
to
place
a
trace
on
it
question
is
there
a
certain
device
out
there
that
i
can
use
to
find
out
the
number
to
the
line
thanks
for
any
response
al
do
you
get
a
dial
tone
when
you
plug
a
phone
into
the
jack
if
not
then
the
line
is
possibly
disconnected
from
the
nearest
telco
junction
box
if
you
do
get
a
dial
tone
then
surely
the
telco
is
sending
a
bill
for
the
line
to
someplace
or
somebody
are
you
sure
that
what
you
are
doing
is
on
the
level
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
just
trying
to
get
at
somebodys
