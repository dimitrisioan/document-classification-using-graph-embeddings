my
car
unfortunately
has
so
much
computer
junk
under
the
hood
that
its
astonishingly
sensitive
to
rfi
hmmmmm
this
has
possibilities
if
the
police
are
in
pursuit
of
a
vehicle
maybe
they
can
bombard
it
with
high
energy
rfi
right
so
all
the
cops
will
be
buying
antique
muscle
cars
for
chase
cars
otherwise
the
police
cars
will
die
too
i
wonder
if
you
could
focus
the
rfi
gun
so
the
cops
wouldnt
have
this
problem
