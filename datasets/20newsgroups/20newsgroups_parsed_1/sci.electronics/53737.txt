i
recall
reading
of
a
phonograph
which
used
mechanical
amplification
compressed
air
was
squirted
out
of
a
valve
which
was
controlled
by
the
pickup
the
result
was
noisy
and
distinctly
lofi
but
much
louder
than
a
conventional
phonograph
it
tended
to
wear
the
disks
out
pretty
quickly
though
this
was
the
pathe
you
are
thinking
of
although
there
were
other
imitators
it
didnt
wear
the
disks
any
more
than
conventional
acoustic
designs
but
it
did
have
a
high
noise
level
due
to
the
continual
hiss
of
escaping
air
there
are
a
lot
of
them
still
operating
and
they
are
pretty
ingenious
there
was
a
pneumatic
amplifier
designed
by
alexander
graham
bell
as
well
but
i
dont
know
if
it
was
ever
constructed
