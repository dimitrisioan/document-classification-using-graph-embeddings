i
am
somewhat
familiar
with
the
db
measurements
as
they
apply
to
electrical
circuits
ie
it
is
the
gain
of
for
example
an
amplifier
measured
on
a
logarithmic
scale
however
this
requires
that
you
have
a
reference
value
ie
the
ouput
is
db
eg
with
respect
to
the
input
signal
stuff
deleted
what
you
actually
talking
about
here
is
dbm
and
not
db
however
the
terms
are
used
loosely
by
most
people
dbm
is
power
with
respact
to
mw
whereas
db
is
a
ratio
now
like
these
two
english
statement
i
am
doing
well
i
am
doing
good
similarly
people
usually
use
db
for
dbm
another
common
mistake
is
spelling
db
instead
of
db
as
you
did
in
your

decibels
are
all
ratios
the
question
that
remains
in
any
ratio
is
the
reference
unit
used
sometimes
this
will
be
a
reference
power
such
as
milliwatt
given
a
certain
circuit
impedance
which
should
also
be
included
in
the
fine
print
or
known
like
ohms
in
an
rf
circuit
of
that
impedance
leading
to
an
accepted
notation
of
dbm
maybe
it
might
be
dbv
disregarding
the
impedance
of
the
circuit
and
power
developed
using
volt
as
reference
amplitude
rather
than
reference
power
or
it
might
have
an
arbitrary
or
omitted
reference
that
is
not
included
in
the
notation
leading
to
just
plain
db
so
look
at
it
this
waydb
has
an
implied
reference
while
notation
such
as
dbm
has
an
explicit
reference
for
power

note
that
in

with

impedance
if
the

goes
up

many

the

also
