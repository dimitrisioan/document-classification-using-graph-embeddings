advice
needed
what
the
world
needs
is
a
meter
that
wont
let
you
change
ranges
or
turn
it
onoff
with
a
lead
stuck
in
the
amps
jack
a
little
bit
of
clever
plastic
detailing
would
take
care
of
this
and
make
the
world
safer
for
electricans
anyway
not
that
ive
ever
put
a
meter
on
the
wrong
range
into
a
live
circuit
no
not
menot
more
than
a
dozen
times
anyway

the
fluke
beeps
at
you
if
you
try
to
take
it
out
of
a
current
measuring
range
while
there
is
still
a
lead
plugged
in
to
the
current
sense
socket
this
should
solve
your
problem
unless
you
are
in
a
noisy
environment
