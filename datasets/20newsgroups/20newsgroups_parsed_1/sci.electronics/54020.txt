buy

shack

a
tv
repair
shop

btw
the
carrier
frequency
is
khz
and
each
different
tvvcrcable
boxstereo
manufacturer
uses
a
unique
pulse
scheme
to
perform
each
different
function
on
their
equipment
some
tvs
including
my
rca
set
at
home
uses
simple
carriers
which
i
think
run
between
and
or
khz
there
is
no
tone
decoding
in
it
all
one
has
to
do
to
piss
the
thing
off
is
just
hook
an
irled
up
to
a
variable
oscillator
and
tune
through
wreaks
all
kinds
of
havoc
similarly
my
vcr
remote
changes
channels
on
my
cable
box
always
seems
to
change
the
cable
box
to
channel
when
you
do
the

things
do
have
some
overlap
