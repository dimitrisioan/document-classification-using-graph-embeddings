if
i
am
right
about
the
dopplerif
i
spell
it
different
every
time
maybe
one
will
be
right
effect
how
does
the
radar
get
an
accurate
reading
when
the
car
containing
it
is
moving
it
would
seem
to
me
for
all
thats
worth
that
it
would
need
to
be
calibrated
with
the
speedometer
of
the
car
containing
it
i
am
fairly
sure
this
isnt
the
case
so
whats
the
deal
essentially
this
is
actually
how
it
is
done
the
radar
gun
is
tied
into
the
speedometer
of
the
car
no
it
is
independent
of
the
speedometer
the
gun
processes
two
doppler
returnsthe
speed
of
the
car
relative
to
the
pavement
and
the
speed
of
the
target
taking
the
difference
between
the
two
some
guns
with
a
moving
mode
actually
have
a
split
beam
with
one
beam
aimed
preferentially
at
the
pavement
car
and
driver
had
a
good
article
on
traffic
radar
but
it
was
back
in
i
used
its
contents
and
references
to
defend
myself
against
a
bogus
radarmeasured
ticket
it
detailed
moving
mode
which
is
easier
to
defend
against
because
of
the
increased
amount
of
variables
