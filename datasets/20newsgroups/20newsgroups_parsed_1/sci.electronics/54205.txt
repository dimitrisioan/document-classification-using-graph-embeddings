p
programmer
having
vainly
looked
for
devices
capable
of
dealing
to
the
nec
p
dsp
chip
which
dont
require
taking
out
a
mortgage
i
decided
to
roll
my
own
not
a
difficult
task
for
an
given
that
all
the
timing
relationships
are
set
out
in
the
databook
one
thing
bothers
me
that
is
the
accursed
ms
volt
vpp
pulse
sure
a
little
buck
stepup
converter
can
achieve
this
in
what
is
otherwise
an
all
volt
widget
but
i
know
latterday
eproms
dont
need
nearly
this
pulse
length
q
has
anyone
come
up
with
a
more
efficient
programming
algorithm
which
is
failsafe
