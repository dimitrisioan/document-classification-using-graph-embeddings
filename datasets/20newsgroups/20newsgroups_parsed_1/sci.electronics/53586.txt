cheap
products
i
have
an
adcom
gfa
that
i
got
in
there
certainly
isnt
anything
magic
about
it
the
components
used
are
decent
but
nothing
uncommon
with
respect
to
consumer
grade
components
the
gfa
is
a
nice
piece
of
equipment
im
glad
that
adcom
had
the
guts
to
not
overdo
the
packaging
it
irks
me
when
i
see
audiophile
oriented
equipment
whose
case
and
heat
sinks
probably
cost
much
more
and
receive
more
attention
than
the
electronics
they
are
supposed
to
serve
i
dont
see
any
big
deal
about
the
geographic
region
in
which
something
is
assembled
this
is
especially
true
for
something
as
lowtechnology
as
a
gfa
id
hope
that
a
gfa
would
still
work
well
after
several
years
except
under
conditions
of
extreme
abuse
there
isnt
much
there
to
go
wrong
bill
