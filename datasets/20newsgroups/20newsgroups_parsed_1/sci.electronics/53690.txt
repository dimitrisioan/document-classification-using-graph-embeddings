i
am
trying
to
build
a
synchronous
demodulator
and
ive
hit
a
snag
mf
in
my
application
i
want
to
be
able
to
change
the
gain
of
an
mf
op
amp
amplifier
from
to
controlable
via
a
digital
input
mf
the
most
obvious
way
ive
come
up
with
is
to
use
analog
switches
mf
to
adjust
the
gain
of
the
op
amp
the
only
analog
switch
i
have
mf
experience
with
it
the
unfortunately
i
want
to
switch
an
mf
ac
signal
which
goes
from
about
v
to
v
and
the
is
only
mf
for
positive
signals
how
about
using
a
it
has
a
seperate
ground
for
the
analog
outputs
it
would
get
you
bits
mf
another
part
which
caught
my
eye
was
the
analog
devices
ad
this
mf
is
a
balanced
demodulator
which
appears
to
fill
exactly
the
need
i
mf
have
the
data
sheet
was
somewhat
skimpy
on
application
notes
could
mf
someone
comment
on
using
this
chip
for
the
following
application
or
how
about
a
multiplying
da
convertor
this
is
essentiallty
