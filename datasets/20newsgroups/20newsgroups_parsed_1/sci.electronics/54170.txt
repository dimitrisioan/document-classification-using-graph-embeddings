re
how
to
the
disks
copy
protected
hmmm
a
possibility
for
the
software
registration
conondrum
would
be
to
have
the
distributor
register
the
copy
when
the
software
was
sold
the
clerk
sticks
it
in
the
store
pc
and
asks
for
the
buyers
id
later
if
pirated
versions
showed
up
they
could
be
tracked
to
the
original
purchaser
in
addition
copies
which
were
sent
to
distributorsstores
would
have
a
vendor
reg
or
serial
in
order
to
track
in
store
piracy
possible
additional
program
security
schemes
would
be
having
monthly
password
changes
which
necessitate
user
call
in
and
registration
inconvenient
taking
dire
legal
action
on
anyone
caught
expensive
encryption
crc
check
self
modifying
code
limited
effectiveness
have
an
independent
watchdog
program
in
the
installationsetup
config
or
memory
manager
etc
which
would
check
the
main
programs
crc
only
as
effective
as
above
methods
at
best
have
the
above
watchdog
circulating
as
a
virus
which
would
trash
cracked
copies
of
the
program
andor
the
offenders
hard
drive
risky
and
probably
illegal
certainly
immoral
my
new
ideas
arent
terribly
feasible
to
implement
as
presented
but
i
thought
if
i
threw
them
out
people
could
think
of
variations
that
might
be
effective
what
is
the
problem
with
parallel
port
security
keys
i
havent
used
anything
that
had
hardware
key
copy
protection
schemes
so
i
dont
know
what
the
drawbacks
are
i
know
the
companies
that
make
them
claim
theyre
uncrackable
but
ive
seen
cracks
of
autodesk
dstudio
floating
around
i
dont
have
one
so
dont
ask
and
i
had
heard
that
it
had
parralel
port
keys
my
apologies
if
i
rambled
but
vi
inhibits
my
communication
skills
greatly
