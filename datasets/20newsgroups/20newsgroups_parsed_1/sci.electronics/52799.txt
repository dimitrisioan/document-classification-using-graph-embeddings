the
beam
is
split
in
two
with
one
beam
aimed
at
the
target
car
sort
of
and
the
other
at
the
ground
the
speeds
of
each
are
calulated
for
the
final
number
actually
this
is
true
on
the
more
expensive
ones
but
the
cheaper
ones
just
read
the
speedometer
ive
never
seen
a
speedometerreading
model
are
you
sure
who
makes
them
consider
the
difficulty
of
reading
the
speedo
on
various
makes
of
cars
in
use
ive
seen
single
beam
movingmode
and
split
beam
movingmode
obviously
the
police
officer
reads
the
speedometer
i
can
not
believe
the
nitpicking
in
this
group
theres
beams
there
is
not
is
too
