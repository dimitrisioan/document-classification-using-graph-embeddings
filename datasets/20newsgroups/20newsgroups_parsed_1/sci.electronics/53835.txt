laser
vs
bubblejet
well
im
not
too
sure
if
this
would
be
the
right
place
to
post
this
but
anyway
here
goes
i
was
just
noticing
that
some
of
the
current
bubblejet
printers
offers
up
to
x
resolution
while
a
lot
of
lower
end
laser
printers
only
offer
x
however
the
laser
printers
still
seems
to
be
significantly
pricier
than
the
bubblejets
how
is
this
or
am
i
missing
something
about
the
resolution
thing
sheng
