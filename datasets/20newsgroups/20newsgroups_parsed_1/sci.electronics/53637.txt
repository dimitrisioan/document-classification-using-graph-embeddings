my
friend
has
a
nice
alpine
car
stereo
and
it
only
has
channels
but
one
of
them
does
not
work
it
does
not
put
out
any
current
or
voltage
at
all
is
that
channel
therefore
blown
i
then
shut
the
radio
off
and
ran
continuity
into
the
two
speaker
ouputs
of
the
channel
and
it
charged
and
discharged
so
i
know
the
wires
just
aint
bad
this
probably
only
tells
you
that
the
dc
blocking
capacitor
thats
in
series
between
the
onechip
singleended
audio
amp
and
the
speaker
terminal
is
there
any
ideas
open
it
up
and
look
for
the
power
amp
ics
theyll
be
fairly
obvious
replace
the
one
connected
to
the
dead
output
also
how
would
i
locate
where
the
signal
of
the
radiotape
unit
is
before
it
gets
amplified
because
then
couldnt
i
hook
up
rca
outputs
to
that
signal
so
then
he
could
just
use
a
little
amplifier
well
one
thing
you
should
do
is
poke
around
the
terminals
of
the
power
amp
chips
use
a
probe
with
a
m
resistor
like
a
scope
probe
connected
to
the
input
of
a
small
audio
amp
wspeaker
if
you
find
linelevel
input
to
both
chips
one
of
the
chips
is
bad
and
can
probably
replaced
pretty
easily
if
you
want
to
pick
off
a
nearlinelevel
signal
suitable
for
feeding
to
an
outboard
amp
the
outer
legs
of
the
volume
control
pot
will
often
be
good
enough
this
is
before
the
volume
control
and
usually
before
the
tone
and
balance
controls
too
if
you
take
off
from
the
center
and
ground
legs
of
the
volume
pot
this
will
be
after
the
volume
control
but
again
probably
before
the
other
controls
if
the
unit
is
a
modern
type
with
an
electronic
volume
control
chip
you
should
probably
forget
the
whole
thing
