does
anyone
know
the

for

the

are

a
cursory
physical
examination
of
the

indicates
that

can

fill

thanks
heres
the
scoop
when
you
get
your
home
brew
receiver
working
would
you
be
willing
to
share
it
with
the
rest
of
us
i
always
wanted
to
build
my
own
but
never
have
the
time
to
fool
around

design

repeater
connectors
the
infrared
repeater
jacks
on
the
back
of
the
preamp
are
not
connected
to
anything
inside
the
preamp
except
the
pin
connector
pin
there
is
a
ohm
resistor
between
the
two
jacks
with
a
k
from
pin
to
ground
the
signal
pin
in
the
preamp
is
summed
with
the
built
in
ir
receiver
they
use
a
chip
called
cxa
and
a
bjt
to
amplify
the
signal
i
would
imagine
the
logical
way
would
be
to
duplicate
this
circuit
and
use
it
as
the
external
receiver
if
you
need
more
info
let
me
know
