gave
up
after
a
year
of
letters
and
phone
calls
i
got
the
impression
the
fcc
was
powerless
and
it
was
up
to
the
cable
company
to
correct
the
situation
isnt
there
some
formal
action
a
citizen
can
take
that
requires
the
fcc
to
at
least
generate
some
paperwork

for
those
who
are
interested
the
fcc
does
indeed
care
about
cable
leakage
particularly
into
the
aviation
nav
band
or
leakage
that
is
causing
interference
to
other
services
part
details
specific
limits
to
acceptable
leakage
and
measurement
technique
if
you
will
clearly
document
your
problem
and
measurement
technique
a
signal
level
meter
with
dipole
is
the
normal
approach
remember
to
correct
between
measurement
data
and
microvolts
per
meter
and
fax
or
mail
the
details
to
mr
john
wong
cable
branch
fcc
m
st
nw
wash
dc
and
a
copy
of
your
letter
to
the
local
cable
company
you
will
get
results
in
fact
the
cable
company
will
probably
start
treating
you
much
better
when
they
realize
you
have
figured
out
how
to
get
the
fccs
attention
what
is
important
is
to
document
your
case
as
it
relates
to
the
applicable
rules
however
the
cable
company
is
required
to
at
least
check
out
every
complaint
of
leakage
they
must
file
with
the
commission
and
maintain
on
premises
a
yearly
measurement
report
that
details
the
results
of
leakage
testing
but
remember
call
the
cable
company
first
and
give
them
a
chance
to
work
to
correct
the
problem
before
contacting
the
commission
i
am
in
the
business
of
measuring
cable
system
leakage
via
the
airborne
method
