fm
transmitter
for
remote
alarm

pretty
high
frequency
for
one
chip
is
there
an

be
used
for
this
purpose
any

be
greatfully
accepted

reply
to

would
use
the

transmitter
chip
from
motorola
linear
and
interface
databook
a
stable
cristal
oscillator
and
a
mixer
eg
sbl
from
mini

everything
is
done
in
the
fm
chip
and
then
mixed
up
with
the
oscillator
frequency
just
have
a
look

the
arrl

there
are
lots
of
ideas
