circuit

are

writes
the
color
of
the
board
shows
the
composition
of
it
hence
the
use
of
it
original
and
older
boards
were
bakelite
composition
and
were
brown
phenolic
spelling
was
a
tan
most
non
filled
fiberglass
boards
used
in
computers
are
green
filled
fiberglass
is
blue
teflon
is
white
rubbish
the
reason
for
the
colour
of
the
boards
depends
on
the
solder
mask
that
is
used
older
boards
bakelite
and
phenolic
rarely
used
a
solder
mask
these
boards
are
not
suited
well
to
automatic
stuffing
and
soldering
techniques
and
hence
are
the
colour
of
the
compound
used
to
make
them
these
days
boards
are
made
of
fibreglass
for
most
general
purpose
uses
and
have
a
solder
mask
applied
to
them
to
prevent
close
traces
shorting
to
one
another
during
soldering
and
also
to
prevent
the
decomposition
of
traces
under
harsh
environments
the
light
and
dark
green
boards
ofter
seen
have
a
dry
film
mask
applied
to
them
usually
applied
as
a
complete
film
photographically
produced
the
blue
and
red
or
orange
boards
are
a
twopart
epoxy
or
a
liquidimageable
resist
formulation
and
are
applied
in
a
different
manner
theres
a
lot
of
info
about
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
but
thats
another
