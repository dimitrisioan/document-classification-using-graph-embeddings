well
im
not
too
sure
if
this
would
be
the
right
place
to
post
this
but
anyway
here
goes
i
was
just
noticing
that
some
of
the
current
bubblejet
printers
offers
up
to
x
resolution
while
a
lot
of
lower
end
laser
printers
only
offer
x
however
the
laser
printers
still
seems
to
be
significantly
pricier
than
the
bubblejets
how
is
this
or
am
i
missing
something
about
the
resolution
thing
bubblejets
often
splatter
a
little
bit
whereas
laserjets
given
halfway
decent
toner
like
hps
microfine
stuff
dont
both
produce
very
good
output
but
you
dont
have
to
look
too
closely
at
the
two
to
tell
that
laserjet
output
is
definitely
superior
on
the
other
hand
laserjets
which
havent
been
maintained
properly
and
use
the
cheapest
toner
the
owner
could
find
often
produce
awful
output
much
worse
than
a
bubblejet
one
other
thing
there
are
bubblejets
and
then
there
are
bubblejets
there
are
a
few
bubblejets
out
there
that
produce
rather
mediocre
output
such
as
hps
dinky
little
bubblejet
whereas
most
produce
really
good
looking
output
such
as
hps
deskjets
ibm
and
canon
both
produce
some
of
the
really
good
style
bubblejets

ps
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
portable
bublejet
printer
i
can
highly
recommend
the
hp
portable
deskjet
although
ive
heard
the
portable
canons
are
good
too
i
needed
pcl
support
myself
with
the
deskjet
portable
you
even
get
an
undocumented
pcmcia
card
slot
