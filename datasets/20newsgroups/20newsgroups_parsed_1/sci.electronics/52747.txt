dont
use
big
capacitors
they
are
unreliable
for
timing
due
to
leakage
instead
use
a
quartz
crystal
and
divide
its
frequency
by
times
or
something
like
that
mhz
divided
by
cycle
per
weeks
approximately
i
wouldnt
expect
any
components
other
than
batteries
or
electrolytic
capacitors
to
fail
at
c
or
f
for
that
matter
either
the
battery
is
going
to
be
your
big
problem
also
of
course
your
circuit
shouldnt
depend
on
exact
values
of
resistors
which
a
crystal
controlled
timer
wont
wouldnt
a
crystal
be
affected
by
cold
my
gut
feeling
is
that
as
a
mechanically
resonating
device
extreme
cold
is
likely
to
affect
the
compliance
terminology
of
the
quartz
and
hence
its
resonant
frequency
