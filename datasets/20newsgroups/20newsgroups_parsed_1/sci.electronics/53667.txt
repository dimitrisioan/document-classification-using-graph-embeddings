subject
uartcpuromram
subsystem
this
is
a
followup
post
to
something
ive
written
previously
several
people
responded
with
good
information
but
i
dont
think
i
communicated
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
im
working
on
a
custom
io
device
that
will
communicate
with
a
host
via
rs
my
custom
circuitry
will
use
an
ceb
or
ec
cpu
and
require
about
k
of
ram
preferably
flash
ram
in
looking
around
i
see
that
lots
of
people
have
engineered
uartcpuromram
subsystems
that
are
ready
to
be
interfaced
to
your
custom
io
devices
its
been
done
so
much
that
it
would
be
best
if
i
can
avoid
reinventing
a
system
it
just
needs
to
use
an
c
or
cpu
and
be
able
to
load
a
program
from
the
host
then
transfer
control
to
that
program
well
theres
one
other
thing
the
rom
needs
to
know
how
to
do
it
should
have
routines
to
send
and
receive
bytes
tofrom
the
host
that
utilize
the
hardware
control
lines
dtrrtsdtscts
everything
ive
seen
is
in
the
and
up
range
thats
too
much
for
this
application
i
need
something
around
the
cpu
has
the
uart
builtin
so
youre
only
looking
at
a
few
chips
does
anyone
know
a
company
that
markets
a
good
board
in
this
range
or
some
public
domain
circuitry
i
can
use
thanks
in
advance
for
the
info
rich
