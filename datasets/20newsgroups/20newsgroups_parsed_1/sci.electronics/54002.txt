you
are
probably
referring
to
the
products
of
opto
diode
corp
mitchell
road
newbury
park
ca
the
make
some
amazing
irleds
the
really
highpowered
devices
are
arrays
of
or
leds
on
a
to
header
the
chip
model
puts
out
watts
in
response
to
a
amp
us
pulse
at
a
duty
cycle
i
think
these
are
designed
as
illuminators
for
ir
vision
systems
jeez
that
should
do
it
i
would
also
be
interested
in
the
application
here
i
work
with
a
dance
and
technology
program
and
want
to
build
something
to
track
dancers
on
a
foot
wide
stage
from
feet
away
very
interesting
application
controlled
lighting
and
environment
moderate
distances
might
be
more
interesting
than
my
application
just
a
thought
you
could
use
a
roof
mounted
ir
sender
similar
in
operation
to
a
tv
remote
control
that
tells
each
persons
coded
ir
pulser
to
send
a
pulse
a
hamamatsu
detector
as
was
mentioned
in
a
previous
message
in
this
thread
would
give
the
current
position
store
and
collate
this
on
a
computer
and
you
could
replay
the
movements
on
the
screen
