if
you
are
going
to
use
one
where
it
counts
egaviation
space
scuttle
etc
then
i
suggest
you
go
and
buy
a
fluke
never
seen
a
beckman
however
for
every
other
use
you
can
buy
a
cheapie
my
beckman
died
a
few
days
ago
thanks
do
about
a
or
foot
drop
onto
a
lab
table
probably
not
indicative
of
anything
but
ive
already
filled
out
the
requisition
for
a
fluke
oh
yeah
and
sometimes
our
measurements
here
do
count
not
often
but
often
enough
that
i
want
at
least
one
good
meter
