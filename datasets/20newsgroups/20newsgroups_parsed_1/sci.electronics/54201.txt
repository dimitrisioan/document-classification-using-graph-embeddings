i
have
always
thought
that
if
i
wanted
to
send
the
police
a
tape
with
a
ransom
demand
on
it
or
send
cnn
a
video
tape
to
see
if
they
wanted
to
buy
it
i
would
place
a
small
magnet
near
the
takeup
spool
so
the
tape
would
be
erased
as
it
was
played
who
would
think
to
check
that
is
an
exceptionally
cool
idea
would
it
work
how
strong
a
field
is
needed
