wondering
if
its
possible
to
use
radio
waves
to
measure
the
distance
between
a
transmitters
and
receiver
yes
its
called
radar
well
actually
not
quite
both
radar
and
radioaltimeters
measure
distances
by
measuring
the
time
required
to
transmit
a
signal
then
receive
its
reflection
from
a
target
radar
generally
uses
pulses
while
radio
altimeters
use
either
pulses
or
a
modulated
continuouswave
transmission
in
the
case
of
the
latter
highly
accurate
distance
measurement
can
be
made
as
an
example
the
original
bendix
ala
radio
altimeter
was
accurate
to
foot
at
feet
altitude
note
however
that
this
is
a
different
method
of
measuring
than
the
poster
originally
asked
about
the
problem
with
gaining
accurate
measurements
between
a
transmitter
and
a
seperate
receiver
is
that
you
need
a
highly
accurate
time
base
which
starts
at
the
receiver
at
the
exact
instant
the
transmitter
triggers
this
can
not
be
wire
connected
since
radio
waves
will
actually
travel
faster
in
freespace
air
in
this
case
than
wire
the
difference
is
called
the
velocity
factor
of
the
cable
so
you
need
to
resort
to
a
common
timebase
that
is
automatically
corrected
for
distance
etc
something
like
a
pll
connected
to
a
gps
receiver
should
do
the
trick
triggering
both
the
transmitter
and
receiver
simultaneously
sound
expensive
not
too
bad
but
plan
on
spending
a
few
bucks
in
both
equipment
and
effort
why
not
go
to
a
different
method
surveyors
use
a
laserlight
system
where
again
the
reflection
time
is
measured
why
not
try
this
sounds
like
something
a
pe
should
know
about
anyway
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
measure
the
signal
strength
and
determine
distance
this
would
be
for
short
distances
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuracy
of
inches
or
so
this
is
actually
highly
inaccurate
since
the
power
output
of
a
transmitter
varies
from
unit
to
unit
there
are
variances
in
the
antenna
and
transmission
line
and
the
receiver
may
also
vary
both
from
unit
to
unit
and
the
same
unit
over
time
you
would
need
to
continuously
calibrate
the
entire
system
with
the
radio
altimeter
this
is
also
done
but
since
everything
is
located
at
one
place
it
is
much
easier
to
do
note
especially
that
the
time
base
for
the
ra
receiver
and
transmitter
is
one
unit
also
depends
on
the
environment
in
a
static
environent
such
as
a
waveguide
yes
in
a
dynamic
environment
with
objects
moving
about
the
multipath
kills
this
concept
nope
fm
capture
effect
says
that
the
strongest
signal
wins
that
is
unless
the
two
interfering
signals
are
seperated
by
more
than
db
in
signal
strength
this
is
the
one
problem
that
makes
altimeters
inaccurate
at
very
low
altitudes
signals
bouncing
off
runways
tend
to
be
very
strong
what
frequencies
would
be
best
for
this
or
does
matter
as
high
as
possible
to
eliminate
outside
influence
and
also
to
enhance
attenuation
of
multipath
signals
radio
altimeters
typically
use
frequencies
around
ghz
hope
this
helps
