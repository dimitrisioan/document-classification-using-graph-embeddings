we
have
a
setup
with
with
polaroid
transducers
and
rangefinders
we
would
like
to
fire
these
three
at
a
time
with
about
ms
between
firings
the
three
that
are
being
fired
do
not
fire
in
the
same
direction
to
further
explain
the
situation
assume
we
are
firing
sonars
abc
ms
apart
each
other
we
should
normally
see
an
echo
on
a
that
corresponds
to
the
distance
however
sonar
a
detects
the
init
line
of
sonar
b
the
detection
is
actually
through
the
transducer
of
sonar
a
we
can
see
a
very
faint
khz
signal
on
the
transducer
exactly
at
the
time
the
init
line
of
sonar
b
is
activated
we
feel
that
there
is
some
ground
coupling
that
is
causing
this
interference
we
came
to
this
conclusion
since
we
are
using
a
separate
power
supply
for
sonars
b
and
c
has
anyone
else
had
any
problems
with
these
particular
units
and
this
type
of
experience
your
suggestions
for
remedies
will
be
greatly
appreciated
