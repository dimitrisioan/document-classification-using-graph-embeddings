im
trying
to
bring
in
bits
to
a
pc
and
would
like
to
use
interruptdriven
routines
without
buying
an
io
board
or
making
a
new
port
where
can
i
bring
in
these
bits
lpt
seems
to
have
only
a
few
inputs
but
ive
heard
rumours
that
some
lpts
have
bidirectional
lines
anybody
know
fer
sure
if
any
bid
lpts
which
boards
have
them
ill
be
running
a
new
dx
yes
it
is
possible
im
making
a
stepper
controller
board
with
digital
inputs
and
up
to
digital
outputs
from
the
port
one
main
thing
that
will
tell
you
whether
the
port
is
bidirectional
or
not
is
the
bus
tranceiver
on
it
look
for
a
chip
numbered
ls
if
you
dont
have
this
then
its
probably
a
ls
which
will
do
you
no
good
for
reading
in
now
if
you
do
have
the
then
do
the
following
first
find
the
address
of
the
port
decimal
either
or
in
pascal
you
would
writeportxxx
where
xxx
is
the
address
in
either
hex
or
decimal
the
status
lines
pins
as
well
as
the
strobe
pin
are
bidirectional
lines
and
are
read
by
base
address
so
for
to
read
from
status
then
read
from
you
can
also
output
to
these
lines
in
the
same
fashion
as
to
the
data
lines
in
pascal
do
portxxxvalue
hope
this
helps
let
me
know
if
you
need
more
help
inspiration
