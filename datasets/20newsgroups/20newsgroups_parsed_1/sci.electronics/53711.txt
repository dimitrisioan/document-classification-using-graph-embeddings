can
i
use
a
for
digital
signals
i
dont
see
why
it
couldnt
handle
digital
signals
but
i
could
be
wrong
anyone
have
any
advice
thanks
the
switches
have
a
nonnegligable
on
resistance
up
to
k
ohm
when
powered
by
volts
and
a
maximum
current
and
a
maximum
static
voltage
across
switch
not
a
good
bet
for
ttl
should
work
for
cmos
but
slow
things
down
a
bit
there
are
hc
versions
that
have
better
specs
but
lower
max
voltage
mark
zenier
