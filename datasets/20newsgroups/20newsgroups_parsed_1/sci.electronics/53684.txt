re
what
do
nuclear
sites
cooling
towers
do
lots
of
pretty
good
stuff
about
how
the
huge
towers
near
most
nuclear
power
plants
are
there
to
cool
the
used
steam
back
into
near
ambient
temperature
water
deleted
water
as
i
recall
the
water
isnt
as
hot
thermodynamically
in
many
fossil
fuel
plants
and
of
course
there
is
less
danger
of
radioactive
contamination
actually
fossil
fuel
plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
as
a
point
of
info
some
of
the
early
nuclear
power
plants
in
this
country
used
the
fission
pile
as
a
first
stage
to
get
the
water
hot
and
then
had
a
second
stage
fossil
fuel
step
to
get
the
water
actually
steam
very
hot
i
remember
seeing
this
at
con
edisons
indian
point
power
plant
which
is
about
miles
north
of
nyc
and
built
more
or
less
all

usual

whatever
they
may
be
