compressor
problem
i
have
a
stereo
compressorlimiter
by
audio
logic
model
mt
the
gates
work
but
the
compressor
seems
to
be
gone
on
one
channel
and
very
weak
on
the
other
ill
probably
need
an
ocsilloscope
to
trace
it
down
no
pun
intended
but
if
any
one
with
experience
with
this
type
of
equipment
could
point
me
in
a
certain
direction
as
to
where
the
circuit
is
most
likely
to
fail
id
sure
appreciate
it
