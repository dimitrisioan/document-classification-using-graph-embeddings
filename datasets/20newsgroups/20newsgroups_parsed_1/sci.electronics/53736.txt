re
how
starters
work
really
so
when
you
turn
on
the
power
this
causes
the
bulb
to
work
like
a
neon
imprecise
this
description
ignores
the
role
of
the
ballast
misrepresents
the
heating
effects
in
the
starter
the
bimetalic
strip
cools
down
immediately
after
the
contacts
ive
been
thinking
of
sending
into
mad
magazine
an
idea
for
a
parody
of
those
books
entitled
how
things
work
that
engineers
buy
their
sons
which
explain
how
engines
elevators
flourescent
lights
etc
work
the
parody
would
be
how
things
really
work
under
canned
food
on
the
left
page
youd
see
the
description
from
how
things
work
gleaming
stainless
steel
equipment
pasteurizing
the
food
to
precisely
the
right
temperature
then
sealing
the
can
in
an
oxygenfree
environment
etc
on
the
right
page
youd
see
how
things
really
work
braindead
workers
sending
disgusting
food
to
the
gleaming
equipment
rotting
vegetables
parts
of
animals
people
dont
eat
barrels
of
sugar
and
chemicals
under
elevators
youd
see
on
the
left
computer
geniuses
working
out
algorithms
so
that
x
number
of
people
waiting
for
y
elevators
will
get
to
z
floors
in
the
shortest
time
on
the
right
youd
see
giggling
elevator
controllers
behind
a
oneway
mirror
in
the
lobby
choosing
which
people
appear
to
be
in
the
biggest
hurry
and
making
them
wait
longest
why
my
thoughts
are
my
own
when
they
are
in
but
when
they
are
out
they
are
anothers
