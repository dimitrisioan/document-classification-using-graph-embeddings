basically
i
am
looking
for
something
to
operate
in
the
ranges
of
accelerations
found
in
an
automobile
environment
i
would
like
the
device
to
operate
as
a
trigger
for
other
systems
when
the
cars
deceleration
reaches
a
threshold
value
which
is
how
i
assume
some
seat
belt
lock
mechanisms
and
air
bag
deployment
systems
work
open
up
one
of
the
airbag
control
boxes
they
have
inexpensive
piezoelectric
accelerometers
in
them
i
know
that
the
gm
cars
use
the
setra
units
the
cheapest
way
to
get
such
an
accelerometer
is
to
cannibalize
an
existing
automotive
unit
incidentally
these
things
arent
very
linear
but
for
the
application
they
would
do
a
fine
job
