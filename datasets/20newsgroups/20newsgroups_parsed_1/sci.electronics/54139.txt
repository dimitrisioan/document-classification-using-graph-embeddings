wri
hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
ham
rigs
not
possible
either
youd
need
about
a
amp
alternator
for
just
the
amplifier
i
can
just
see
it
you
need
to
slow
down
on
a
downgrade
so
you
hit
the
push
to
talk
button
now
that
indeed
is
possible
a
good
friend
of
mine
is
running
about
kw
pep
from
his
car
yes
he
does
have
a
second
alternator
yes
he
calls
the
rig
an
electronic
brake
since
the
engine
noticeably
slows
when
the
key
is
down
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
knew
the
electronics
of
ham
radio
but
i
seem
to
remember
that
pep
is
actually
x
the
real
power
which
makes
kw
pep
actually
around
w
or
was
it
x
i
disremember
effective
transmitted
power
is
also
odd
in
that
it
takes
into
account
antenna
height
and
geometry
which
is
why
a
tv
station
with
a
kw
klystron
might
advertise
a
megawatt
if
their
antenna
is
on
the
top
of
the
cn
tower
this
is
like
sears
hp
though
real
watts
still
isnt
impossible
about
a
with
a
v
alternator
less
if
the
alternator
produces
higher
voltages
its
only
three
horsepower
taking
into
account
inefficiencies
youll
feel
it
when
you
hit
the
key
but
not
too
much

list
it
sorta
depends
on
what
you
drive
i
remember
running
a
two
channel
motorola
with
a
vibrator
power
supply
and
about
tubes
in
a
volkwagen
the
poor
little
v
generator
had
a
heck
of
a
time
and
if
you
keyed
the
mic
at
night
you
needed
to
be
stationary
because
your
lights
got
awful
dim
isnt
progress
wonderful
