i
built
a
little
project
using
the
radio
shack
vdc
relays
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretty
bad
clicks
when
the
thing
switched
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switching
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
noise
of
any
kind
on
the
audio
lines
i
missed
the
first
part
of
this
thread
are
you
switching
line
level
or
speaker
level
audio
if
line
level
theres
a
single
chip
x
stereo
audio
switch
available
that
switches
twochannel
inputs
into
twochannel
output
and
also
has
a
mute
function
all
controllable
with
ttl
inputs
lm
i
think
if
speaker
level
never
mind
