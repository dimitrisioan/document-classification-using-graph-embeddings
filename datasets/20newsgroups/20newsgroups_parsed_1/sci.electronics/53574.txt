im
doing
sound
for
a
couple
of
bands
around
here
and
we
need
direct
input
boxes
for
the
keyboards
these
are
the
little
boxes
that
take
a
line
level
out
of
the
keyboard
and
transform
it
into
lowz
for
the
run
to
the
mixer
sadly
they
cost
like
or
more
each
and
im
going
this
is
indeed
one
function
but
more
sophisticated
ones
do
level
control
and
groundlift
separating
the
keyboard
and
mixer
earths
aswell
to
need
like
or
of
them
i
looked
inside
one
belonging
to
another
band
and
it
looks
like
just
a
transformer
does
anyone
have
simple
ones
are
just
that
a
transformer
a
decent
quality
audio
trans
former
will
cost
most
of
that
they
are
wired
thus
hot
hot
input
from
balanced
out
to
mixer
keyboard
cold
gnd
gnd
the
groundlift
switch
disconnects
the
gnd
line
from
the
mixer
the
transformer
ratio
depends
on
the
precise
application
but
around
turns
ratio
may
be
a
good
place
to
start
