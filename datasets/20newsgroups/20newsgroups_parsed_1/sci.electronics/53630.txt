i
was
also
sceptical
about
the
amps
being
built
in
the
fareast
or
whereever
but
if
you
look
in
the
amp
and
see
what
components
they
use
and
how
it
was
designed
you
can
easily
see
why
the
amplifiers
sound
so
brilliant
good
pointalso
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
that
the
components
they
use
offshore
are
of
inferior
quality
as
long
as
it
was
properly
designed
and
robust
premium
components
are
used
it
shouldnt
matter
where
it
is
assembled
i
can
not
see
why
people
say
the
amplifier
wont
last
not
with
those
quality
components
inside
sure
the
amp
runs
very
fairly
hot
but
thats
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incredibly
good
an
amp
that
runs
hot
has
no
bearing
on
how
its
gon
na
sound
the
amp
you
have
probably
is
running
classa
the
whole
day
actually
id
be
wary
of
excessively
hot
amps
cauz
even
though
the
components
inside
may
be
rated
to
run
that
way
excessive
heat
will
dramatically
shorten
the
life
of
any
electronic
component
regardless
of
quality
in
fact
an
amp
that
does
run
hot
to
the
touch
is
because
either
the
engineer
or
manufacturer
of
that
amp
wanted
to
skimp
on
heatsinking
or
cooling
to
save
costs
