just
a
thought
of
mine
here
since
an
onhook
line
is
aprox
v
and
offhook
it
usually
drops
below
how
about
an
led
in
series
with
a
zener
say
around
v
onhook
led
on
offhook
led
off
would
this
work
if
anyone
triestried
it
please
let
me
know
aye
theres
the
rub
if
you
draw
enough
current
to
light
an
led
the
equipment
at
the
phone
company
will
think
youve
gone
off
hook
in
the
onhook
state
youre
not
supposed
to
draw
current
which
means
you
should
just
use
your
digital
voltmeter
you
can
use
an
old
vom
but
the
phone
company
equipment
can
detect
that
and
might
think
theres
something
wrong
with
the
cable
look
guys
whats
the
problem
here
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
off
hook
all
you
need
it
to
run
it
in
series
with
the
line
as
i
mentioned
in
my
previous
post
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
on
hook
all
you
need
is
a
voltage
threshold
detector
if
youre
going
to
do
the
series
diode
thing
which
is
the
easiest
just
make
sure
that
the
led
can
take
the
current
i
cant
recall
it
offhand
but
its
something
like
ma
or
more
