patent
law
says
you
can
build
anything
you
want
to
for
your
own
personal
noncommercial
use
im
not
up
on
the
details
of
us
patent
law
but
i
think
this
is
incorrect
there
is
a
reasonable
use
exemption
for
copyright
there
is
none
for
patents
the
exemptions
from
patent
licensing
are
quite
narrow
rd
work
is
exempt
but
personal
use
is
not
that
is
its
okay
to
experiment
with
a
patented
idea
but
not
to
put
it
to
practical
use
eg
to
improve
your
stereo
even
if
its
only
your
own
private
practical
use
of
course
it
is
unlikely
that
discreet
personal
use
will
ever
be
detected
or
that
you
will
ever
be
sued
over
it
all
work
is
one
mans
work
