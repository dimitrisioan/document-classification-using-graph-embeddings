i
got
a
question
from
my
dad
which
i
really
cant
answer
and
id
appreciate
some
netwisdom
his
question
is
about
some
diameter
balls
which
are
attached
to
electric
power
lines
in
his
area
hes
seen
up
to
a
half
dozen
between
two
poles
neither
of
us
have
any
experience
with
electric
power
distribution
my
only
guess
was
that
they
may
be
a
capacitive
device
to
equalize
the
inductance
of
the
grid
but
why
so
many
between
two
poles
anyone
know
what
they
really
are
is
there
a
related
faq
for
this
is
there
a
better
group
to
submit
to
wed
both
appreciate
some
enlightenment
the
balls
are
used
to
reduce
the
amplitude
of
oscillations
of
the
wire
during
periods
of
high
winds
ive
seen
what
looks
like
paint
cans
filled
with
concrete
used
for
the
same
purpose
