we
offered
was
an
engine
cleaning
remove
all
that
oil
before
you
sell
the
car
unfortunately
we
did
not
have
a
high
pressure
this
definately
gets
the
car
going
but
wd
is
highly
flammable
explosive
even
in
the
right
conditions
like
a
vapour
sealed
inside
a
distributor
for
eg
and
contact
points
tend
to
arc
a
tiny
bit
i
once
saw
the
alternatorpoints
cover
blow
completely
off
a
motorcycle
after
it
had
been
restored
to
life
with
wd
fun
to
watch
it
was
a
honda
mr
minibike
and
the
cover
is
only
held
on
by
large
rubber
grommet
so
it
wasnt
really
a
big
blast

ps
as
a
more
serious
aside
it
is
apparently
also
conductive
so
it
is
best
to
exercise
caution
with
it
around
mains
wiring
i
some
years
ago
almost
became
a
victim
of
this
squirted
a
fair
amount
in
an
old
model
teletype
which
was
acting
up
then
turned
it
on
the
eruption
when
the
motor
starting
contacts
broke
was
mighty
spectacular
i
almost
got
my
eyebrows
singed
the
plastic
old
ones
had
safety
glass
cover
over
the
platen
etc
flew
across
the
room
and
several
people
in
the
room
almost
had
heart
attacks
beware
the
explosive
properties
of
wd
vapor
