said
what
to
do
with
old
k
to
all
on
jh
i
was
wondering
if
people
had
any
good
uses
for
old
jh
k
simms
i
have
a
bunch
of
them
for
the
apple
mac
jh
and
i
know
lots
of
other
people
do
to
i
have
tried
to
jh
sell
them
but
have
gotten
no
interest
how
about
collecting
them
all
together
ie
everyones
and
selling
them
as
a
lot
the
other
thing
is
to
give
to
a
recycler
jh
so
if
you
have
an
inovative
use
or
want
to
buy
jh
some
simms
i
would
be
very
interested
in
hearing
jh
about
it
if
they
are
free
and
you
can
send
them
real
cheap
i
would
be
intrested
in
them
hehehe
are
these
chip
or
chip
devices
what
speed
jh
i
have
seen
ram
disc
storage
devices
but
they
have
been
jh
very
pricey
plus
i
am
still
a
little
worried
about
having
data
jh
stored
on
ram
why
do
you
use
a
ram
disk
