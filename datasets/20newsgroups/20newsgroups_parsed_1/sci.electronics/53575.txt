im
looking
to
build
a
microphone
preamp
that
has
very
good
lownoise
characteristics
large
clean
gain
and
incorportates
phantom
power
volts
dc
for
a
pzm
microphone
im
leaning
towards
a
good
lowcost
instrumentation
amplifier
to
maintain
the
balanced
input
from
the
microphone
for
its
good
cmrr
internal
compensation
and
because
i
can
use
a
minimal
of
parts
does
anyone
out
there
have
any
experience
suggestions
advice
etcthat
theyd
like
to
pass
on
id
greatly
appreciate
it
without
doing
anything
really
tricky
the
best
ive
seen
is
the
burrbrown
ina
their
databook
shows
a
good
application
of
this
chip
as
a
phantom
power
mic
pre
ive
had
very
good
results
from
the
ssm
from
pmi
part
of
analogue
devices
they
have
also
now
introduced
the
ssm
which
looks
good
on
paper
but
which
i
havent
tried
yet
