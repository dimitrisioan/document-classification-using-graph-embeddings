how
to
the
disks
copy
protected
nothing
but
if
you
read
my
whole
suggestion
im
saying
that
you
register
via
mail
by
mailing
in
your
registration
card
then
the
company
send
you
the
patch
which
includes
the
info
you
put
on
the
registration
card
the
problem
with
this
scheme
is
that
when
i
buy
a
game
i
want
to
play
it
that
daymailing
a
card
to
and
from
california
would
probably
take
a
week
or
more
