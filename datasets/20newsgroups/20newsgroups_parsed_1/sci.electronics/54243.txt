have

the

of

solder
with
a

content
that
seems
to
have
good
wetting

reatings
can
anyone
tell
me
why
it
is
not
used
silver
is
not
such
an
expensive
metal
andy
for
the
most
part
silversolder
is
not
used
for
general
soldering
tasks
due
to
the
mechanism
of
dendritic
growth
silversolder
when
exposed
to
high
humidity
and
placed
in
an
electric
field
will
actually
grow
dendrites
which
are
conductive
and
will
adventually
electrically
short
across
closely
spaced
nodes
which
are
creating
the
field
for
this
reason
silver
is
allowed
only
in
hermetically
sealed
assemblies
fortunatly
tinlead
solder
is
quite
stable
and
will
not
grow
dendrites
as
fast
as
silversolder
therefore
it
is
used
extensively
