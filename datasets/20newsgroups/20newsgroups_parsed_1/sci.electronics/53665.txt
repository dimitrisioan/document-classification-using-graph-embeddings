re
can
i
use
a
cd
analog
multiplexer
for
digital
signal
as
the
subject
says
can
i
use
a
for
digital
signals
i
dont
see
why
it
couldnt
handle
digital
signals
but
i
could
be
wrong
anyone
have
any
advice
thanks
yes
i
use
hc
and
others
commerically
for
this
purpose
so
rest
assured
it
works
fine
in
one
case
i
route
bit
serial
digital
audio
using
these
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
any
signal
degradation
at
all
which
surprised
me
given
some
pretty
fast
edges
hc
is
specd
at
something
like
db
mhz
into
ohms
the
more
complex
types
are
generally
a
little
slower
and
more
resistive
plain
series
are
not
so
good
at
handling
v
logic
remember
that
the
output
load
is
seen
by
the
input
device
