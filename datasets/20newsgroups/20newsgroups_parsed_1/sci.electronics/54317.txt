what
i
usually
useand
this

is
only
good
on
glassis
either
acetone
or
a
little
benzene
the
latter
of
the
two
is
a
bit
dangerous
possibly
a
carcinogensp
but
it
usualy
gets
the
job
done
i
imagine
you
can
you
the
two
solvents
on
most
metals
as
well
as
glass
but
keep
the
stuff
away
from
plastic
benzene
is
most
definitely
a
carcinogen
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
dont
use
it
