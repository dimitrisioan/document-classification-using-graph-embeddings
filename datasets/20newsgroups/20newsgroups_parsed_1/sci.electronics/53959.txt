my
main
question
is
the
bulb
where
can
i
get
uv
bulbs
do
they
need
a
lot
of
power
etc
etc
ive
seen
them
in
surplus
stores
all
they
are
are
fluorescent
bulbs
without
the
phosphor
and
a
uv
transparent
bulb
special
glass
ive
also
seen
incandescent
versions
that
you
screw
into
an
ordinary
vac
socket
probably
not
what
you
want
im
not
too
concerned
with
whether
its
longwave
or
shortwave
but
hey
if
anyone
has
a
cheap
source
of
bulbs
ill
take
both
one
other
thing
a
friend
of
mine
mentioned
something
about
nearuv
light
being
cheaper
to
get
at
than
actual
uv
light
does
anyone
know
what
he
was
referring
to
as
far
as
i
know
near
uv
as
opposed
to
faruv
is
longwave
uv
near
the
visible
spectrum
longwave
uv
is
safer
as
far
as
accidental
i
hope
exposure
to
the
eyes
as
far
as
fluorescent
minerals
go
the
reason
a
friend
has
a
uv
lamp
some
only
respond
to
only
one
of
short
or
long
uv
hope
this
helps
dave
thanks
much
