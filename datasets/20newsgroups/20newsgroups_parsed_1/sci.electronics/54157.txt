flash
leds
with
sound
im
looking
for
a
circuit
that
will
flash
an
led
on
in
response
to
the
output
from
a
walkman
cassette
player
how
could
i
do
this
i
dont
want
it
just
to
turn
on
i
want
it
to
strobe
once
so
to
speak
per
every
beep
i
put
on
a
cassette
tape
would
it
be
better
to
use
a
circuit
based
on
the
volume
of
the
beeps
on
the
cassette
or
better
for
the
leds
to
respond
to
a
tone
of
a
certain
frequency
is
there
any
easy
way
to
do
either
of
these
im
looking
for
the
simplest
circuit
possible
i
guess
what
im
asking
for
is
some
sort
of
color
organ
but
not
quite
let
me
trt
to
explain
again
im
going
to
have
a
pattern
of
beats
or
beeps
on
a
cassette
tape
so
on
the
tape
youd
hear
beep
pause
beep
pause
beep
pauseetc
with
speed
increasing
as
time
goes
on
i
want
to
synchronize
an
led
probably
two
of
them
with
the
beeps
on
the
cassette
tape
so
the
led
with
each
beep
would
go
on
and
off
real
quick
generating
a
strobe
light
sort
of
effect
the
rapidity
of
the
beeps
on
the
tape
would
in
turn
effect
the
rapidity
of
the
blinking
of
the
leds
and
if
there
was
no
sound
on
the
tape
except
for
background
his
the
leds
would
remain
off
please
help
thanks
