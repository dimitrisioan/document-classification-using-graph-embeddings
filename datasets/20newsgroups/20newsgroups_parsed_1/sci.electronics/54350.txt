just
a
quick
question
what
standard
lab
solvents
can
be
used
to
clean
electronic
equipment
and
components
safely
ie
not
corrode
dissolve
shortout
etc
the
equipment
water
methanol
ccl
you
dont
say
what
kind
of
electronic
equipment
you
mean
its
hard
to
give
a
generic
answer
there
is
essentially
no
solvent
that
wont
do
things
like
washing
lubricant
out
of
switches
when
weve
needed
to
do
an
emergency
cleaning
job
on
things
weve
just
used
distilled
water
the
key
thing
to
remember
is
to
make
sure
the
gear
is
completely
dry
before
powering
it
up
again
we
let
it
dry
for
several
days
to
be
damn
sure
i
doubt
that
methanol
has
significant
advantages
over
water
i
would
be
very
wary
of
ccl
not
least
because
it
is
dangerous
to
you
even
if
its
not
going
to
harm
the
equipment
not
only
is
it
poisonous
but
i
believe
its
now
known
to
be
carcinogenic
