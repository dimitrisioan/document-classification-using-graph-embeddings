i

oh
yeah
this
is
a
fine
place
we
havent
had
the
why
does
concrete
kill
leadacid
batteries
thread
in
at
least
six
months
why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
the
concrete
simply
sucks
all
the
electrons
out
of
the
battery
and
drains
them
into
the
ground
another
explanation
implausible
as
it
is
is
that
the
leadacid
battery
needs
to
be
periodically
charged
toppedoff
otherwise
the
battery
selfdischarges
and
then
undergoes
irreversible
chemical
reaction
naa
the
concrete
sucks
the
life
out
