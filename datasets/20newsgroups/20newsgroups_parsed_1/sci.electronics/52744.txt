ive
started
to
look
at
some
devices
doing
serial
data
transmission
over
fairly
decent
distances
in
fairly
noisy
environments
and
have
seen
a
variety
of
schemes
for
protecting
the
rs
transceivers
and
the
rest
of
the
circuit
from
transients
on
the
serial
lines
im
left
wondering
what
is
the
best
way
of
doing
this
how
necessary
is
it
stuff
deleted
what
is
the
wisdom
on
this
out
there
ta
martin
from
what
i
know
protection
is
necessary
esp
if
you
plan
to
route
the
cables
into
an
unknown
environment
out
of
your
control
things
like
accidental
shorts
between
the
signal
lines
and
power
cables
or
even
lightning
strikes
are
very
likely
and
i
dont
think
you
like
to
see
the
sight
of
your
computer
going
up
in
smoke
even
ethernet
cards
are
protected
ive
looked
at
the
one
in
my
pc
and
the
connector
is
protected
by
a
gas
discharge
tube
but
if
you
plan
to
use
the
serial
cables
for
internal
routings
ie
in
controlled
environments
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
not
to
have
them
suggestion
look
in
the
rs
data
book
they
have
several
rs
transceivers
that
have
overvoltage
protection
among
them
include
the
lt
lt
and
max
and
max
the
maxims
are
suppose
to
be
electrically
isolated
ones
but
still
need
optoisolators
to
work
dont
ask
me
why
ive
never
used
them
before
another
alternative
is
an
rs
surge
protector
two
are
listed
in
the
rs
catalogue
if
you
need
additional
info
ie

nos
just
