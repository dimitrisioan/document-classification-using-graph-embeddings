do

introductiondisclaimers
although
weve
done
a
fair
bit
of
wiring
we
are
not
electricians
and
we
can
not
be
responsible
for
what
you
do
if
youre
at
all
uncertain
about
what
is
correct
or
safe
dont
do
it
contact
someone
qualified
a
licensed
electrician
or
your
local
electrical
inspector
electricity
is
no
joke
mistakes
can
result
in
shocks
fires
or
electrocution
furthermore
our
discussion
is
based
on
the
us
national
electrical
code
nec
and
the
canadian
electrical
code
cec
to
the
best
of
our
abilities
we
have
confirmed
every
detail
with
the
electrical
code
but
we
dont
quote
sections
simply
to
keep
this
thing
readable
if
you
think
were
wrong
we
invite
you
to
correct
us
but
please
quote
references
the
nec
and
the
cec
do
not
in
and
of
themselves
have
the
force
of
law
many
municipalities
adopt
it
en
toto
others
however
do
not
check
your
with
your
local
building
department
and
provincial
hydro
inspection
offices
in
canada
to
find
out
what
applies
in
your
area
also
your
local
electrical
utility
may
also
have
special
requirements
for
electrical
service
installation
bear
in
mind
too
that
we
say
here
applies
primarily
to
ordinary
singlefamily
residences
multifamily
dwellings
mobile
homes
commercial
establishments
etc
are
sometimes
governed
by
different
rules
also
note
that
contrary
to
popular
belief
in
the
us
and
in
some
parts
of
canada
canada
is
not
a
whollyowned
subsidiary
of
the
us
consequently
the
nec
does
not
apply
in
canada
lots
of
things
are
the
same
including
voltages
line
frequencies
and
the
laws
of
physics
but
there
are
a
number
of
crucial
differences
in
the
regulations
where
we
can
weve
noted
them
flagging
the
relevant
passages
with
nec
or
cec
remember
that
the
cec
and
nec
are
minimal
standards
it
is
often
smart
to
go
beyond
their
minimal
requirements
subject
what
is
the
nec
where
can
i
get
a
copy
the
nec
is
a
model
electrical
code
devised
and
published
by
the
national
fire
protection
association
an
insurance
industry
group
its
revised
every
three
years
the
version
has
been
released
you
can
buy
a
copy
at
a
decent
bookstore
or
by
calling
them
directly
at
the
code
exists
in
several
versions
theres
the
full
text
which
is
fairly
incomprehensible
theres
an
abridged
edition
which
has
only
the
sections
likely
to
apply
to
most
houses
and
theres
the
nec
handbook
which
contains
the
authorized
commentary
on
the
code
as
well
as
the
full
text
thats
the
recommended
version
unfortunately
theres
no
handbook
for
the
abridged
edition
and
the
full
handbook
is
expensive
us
plus
shipping
and
handling
subject
what
is
the
cec
where
can
i
get
a
copy
the
canadian
standards
association
is
an
organization
made
up
of
various
government
agencies
power
utilities
insurance
companies
electrical
manufacturers
and
other
organizations
the
csa
publishes
csa
standard
c
which
is
updated
every
two
or
three
years
each
province
adopts
with
some
amendments
this
standard
and
publishes
a
provincespecific
code
book
since
each
province
publishes
its
own
slightly
modified
standard
it
would
be
somewhat
confusing
to
obtain
the
csa
standard
itself
in
this
faq
cec
really
means
the
appropriate
provincial
standard
in
particular
this
faq
is
derived
from
the
ontario
hydro
electrical
safety
code
th
edition
which
is
in
turn
based
on
csa
c
th
edition
while
differences
exist
between
the
provinces
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
avoid
specifictoontario
detail
the
appropriate
provincial
code
can
be
obtained
from
electrical
inspection
offices
of
your
provincial
power
authority
in
ontario
its
ontario
hydro
the
ontario
hydro
book
isnt
overly
fat
its
about
c
and
includes
mailed
updates
i
hear
that
these
standards
are
somewhat
easier
to
read
than
the
equivalent
nec
publications
dont
bother
asking
in
quebec
diy
wiring
is
banned
throughout
the
province
subject
can
i
do
my
own
wiring
extra
pointers
in
most
places
homeowners
are
allowed
to
do
their
own
wiring
in
some
theyre
not
check
with
your
local
electrical
inspector
most
places
wont
permit
you
to
do
wiring
on
others
homes
for
money
without
a
license
nor
are
you
permitted
to
do
wiring
in
commercial
buildings
multiple
dwellings
eg
duplexes
are
usually
considered
semicommercial
or
commercial
however
many
jurisdictions
will
permit
you
to
work
on
semicommercial
wiring
if
youre
supervised
by
a
licensed
electrician
if
you
can
find
one
willing
to
supervise
if
you
do
your
own
wiring
an
important
point
do
it
neat
and
well
what
you
really
want
to
aim
for
is
a
better
job
than
an
electrician
will
do
after
all
its
your
own
home
and
its
you
or
your
family
that
might
get
killed
if
you
make
a
mistake
an
electrician
has
time
pressures
has
the
skills
and
knows
the
tricks
of
the
trade
to
do
a
fast
safe
job
in
this
faq
weve
consciously
given
a
few
recommendations
that
are
in
excess
of
code
because
we
feel
that
its
reasonable
and
will
impress
the
inspector
the
inspector
will
know
that
youre
an
amateur
you
have
to
earn
his
trust
the
best
way
of
doing
this
is
to
spend
your
time
doing
as
neat
a
job
as
possible
dont
cut
corners
exceed
specifications
otherwise
the
inspector
may
get
extremely
picky
and
fault
you
on
the
slightest
transgressions
dont
try
to
hide
anything
from
the
inspector
use
the
proper
tools
ie
dont
use
a
bread
knife
to
strip
wires
or
twist
wires
with
your
fingers
the
inspector
wont
like
it
and
the
results
wont
be
that
safe
and
it
takes
longer
and
youre
more
likely
to
stick
a
hunk
of
ga
wire
through
your
hand
that
way
dont
handle
house
wire
when
its
very
cold
eg
below
c
or
f
thermoplastic
house
wire
particularly
older
types
become
very
brittle
subject
what
do
i
need
in
the
way
of
tools
first
theres
the
obvious
a
hammer
a
drill
a
few
screwdrivers
both
straight
and
phillipshead
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
live
in
canada
or
find
a
source
of
csaapproved
devices
you
need
robertson
square
recess
screwdrivers
and
instead
of
phillips
for
drilling
a
few
holes
a
or
spade
bit
and
or
electric
drill
will
do
if
youre
doing
a
lot
or
are
working
with
elderly
lumber
we
recommend
a
drill
rightangle
drills
are
wonderful
can
be
rented
and
or
screwpoint
auger
drill
bits
these
bits
pull
you
through
so
theyre
much
faster
and
less
fatiguing
even
in
year
old
hardwood
timbers
screwdriver
bits
are
useful
for
drills
expecially
if
you
install
your
electrical
boxes
using
screws
drywall
screws
work
well
for
stripping
wire
use
a
real
wire
stripper
not
a
knife
or
ordinary
wire
cutters
dont
buy
the
kmart
combo
stripper
crimper
and
bottle
opener
types
you
should
expect
to
pay
to
for
a
good
pliertype
pair
it
will
have
sized
stripping
holes
and
wont
nick
or
grab
the
wire
it
should
be
easy
to
strip
wire
with
it
one
model
has
a
small
hole
in
the
blade
for
forming
exact
wire
loops
for
screw
terminals
there
are
fancier
types
autostripcut
but
they
generally
arent
necessary
and
pros
usually
dont
use
them
a
pair
of
diagonal
side
cutter
pliers
are
useful
for
clipping
ends
in
constricted
places
dont
use
these
for
stripping
wire
you
will
need
linesman
pliers
for
twisting
wires
for
wire
nuts
you
should
have
a
pair
of
needlenose
pliers
for
fiddling
inside
boxes
and
closing
loops
but
its
better
to
form
wire
loops
with
a
loop
former
hole
on
your
wire
stripper
more
accurate
if
youre
using
nonmetallic
cable
get
a
cable
stripper
for
removing
the
sheath
or
do
what
some
pros
do
they
nick
the
end
of
the
sheath
grab
the
ground
wire
with
a
pair
of
pliers
and
simply
rip
the
sheath
back
using
the
ground
wire
as
a
zipper
and
cut
the
sheath
off
you
shouldnt
try
to
strip
the
sheath
with
a
knife
point
because
its
too
easy
to
slash
the
insulation
on
the
conductors
apparently
stanley
utility
knives
fitted
with
linoleum
cutters
hooked
blades
can
be
used
to
strip
sheath
but
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
youll
gouge
the
conductors
for
any
substantial
amount
of
work
with
armored
cable
its
well
worth
your
while
to
invest
in
a
rotary
cable
splitter
us
hack
saws
are
tricky
to
use
without
cutting
into
the
wire
or
the
insulation
threeprong
outlet
testers
are
a
quick
check
for
properlywired
outlets
about
multimeters
tell
you
more
but
are
a
lot
more
expensive
and
probably
not
worth
it
for
most
people
a
simple
voltage
sensor
which
can
detect
potential
through
an
insulated
wire
not
supplying
any
devices
is
extremely
helpful
they
cost
about
us
at
radio
shack
you
should
have
a
voltage
detector
to
check
that
the
wires
are
dead
before
doing
work
on
them
neonbulb
version
are
cheap
and
work
well
if
you
get
more
serious
a
audible
alarm
type
is
good
for
tracing
circuits
without
a
helper
though
ive
been
known
to
lock
the
drill
on
and
hit
breakers
until
the
scream
stops
for
running
wires
through
existing
walls
you
need
fish
tape
often
two
tapes
are
needed
though
sometimes
a
bent
hanger
or
a
length
of
thin
chain
will
suffice
fish
tapes
can
be
rented
electrical
tape
lots
of
it
seriously
a
good
and
competent
wiring
job
will
need
very
little
tape
the
tape
is
useful
for
wrapping
dicy
insulation
in
repair
work
another
use
is
to
wrap
around
the
body
of
outlets
and
switches
to
cover
the
termination
screws
i
dont
do
this
but
drywall
contractors
prefer
it
to
prevent
explosions
when
the
drywall
knife
collides
with
a
live
outlet
that
has
no
cover
plate
subject
what
is
ul
listing
the
ul
stands
for
underwriters
laboratory
it
used
to
be
an
insurance
industry
organization
but
now
it
is
independent
and
nonprofit
it
tests
electrical
components
and
equipment
for
potential
hazards
when
something
is
ullisted
that
means
that
the
ul
has
tested
the
device
and
it
meets
their
requirements
for
safety
ie
fire
or
shock
hazard
it
doesnt
necessarily
mean
that
the
device
actually
does
what
its
supposed
to
just
that
it
probably
wont
kill
you
the
ul
does
not
have
power
of
law
in
the
us
you
are
permitted
to
buy
and
install
nonullisted
devices
however
insurance
policies
sometimes
have
clauses
in
them
that
will
limit
their
liability
in
case
of
a
claim
made
in
response
to
the
failure
of
a
nonullisted
device
furthermore
in
many
situations
the
nec
will
require
that
a
wiring
component
used
for
a
specific
purpose
is
ullisted
for
that
purpose
indirectly
this
means
that
certain
parts
of
your
wiring
must
be
ullisted
before
an
inspector
will
approve
it
andor
occupancy
permits
issued
subject
what
is
csa
approval
every
electrical
device
or
component
must
be
certified
by
the
canadian
standards
association
before
it
can
be
sold
in
canada
implicit
in
this
is
that
all
wiring
must
be
done
with
csaapproved
materials
they
perform
testing
similar
to
the
ul
a
bit
more
stringent
except
that
csa
approval
is
required
by
law
again
like
the
ul
if
a
fire
was
caused
by
noncsaapproved
equipment
your
insurance
company
may
not
have
to
pay
the
claim
in
canada
there
is
a
branch
organization
of
the
ul
called
ulc
ul
of
canada
ulc
does
not
have
power
of
law
and
seems
to
be
more
a
liason
group
between
the
csa
and
insurance
companies
subject
are
there
any
cheaper

canada
ps
knight
authors
and
publishes
a
book
called
electrical

simplified
there
appears
to
be
a
version
published
specific
to
each
province
and
is
very
tied
into
the
appropriate
provincial
code
it
focuses
on
residential
wiring
and
is
indispensible
for
canadian
diyers
it
is
better
to
get
this
book
than
the

unless
you
do
a

how
and
what
why

most
jurisdictions
require
that
you
obtain
a
permit
and
inspections
of
any
wiring
that
is
done
amongst
other
more
mundane
bureaucratic
reasons
like
insurance
companies
not
liking
to
have
to

a

provides
some
assurance
that

job
most
jurisdictions
have
the
power
to
order
you
to
vacate
your
home
or
order
you
to
tear
out
any
wiring
done
without
a
permit
california
for
instance
is
particularly
nasty
about
this
if
fire
starts
in
your
home
and
uninspected
wiring
is
at
fault
insurance
companies
will
often
refuse
to
pay
the
damage
claims
in
general
the
process
goes
like
this
you
apply
to
your
local
inspections
office
or
building
department
for
a
permit
you
should
have
a
sketch
or
detailed
drawing
of
what
you
plan
on
doing
this
is
a
good
time
to
ask
questions
on
any
things
youre
not
sure
of
if
youre
doing
major
work
they
may
impose
special
conditions
on
you
require
loading
calculations
and
ask
other
questions
at
this
point
they
will
tell
you
which
inspections
you
will
need
if
youre
installing
a
main
panel
you
will
need
to
have
the
panel
and
service
connections
inspected
before
your
power
utility
will
provide
a
connection
this
is
sometimes
done
by
the
local
power
authority
rather
than
the
usual
inspectors
after
installing
the
boxes
and
wiring
but
before
the
insulationwalls
go
up
you
will
need
a
roughin
inspection
after
the
walls
are
up
and
the
wiring
is
complete
you
will
need
a
final
inspection

my

there

there
are
some
exceptions

in

however
any

a
word
on
voltages
one
thing
where
things
might
get
a
bit
confusing
is
the
different
numbers
people
bandy
about
for
the
voltage
of
a
circuit
one
person
might
talk
about
v
another
v
or
another
v
these
are
all
in
fact
exactly
the
same
thing
in
north
america
the
utility
companies
are
required
to
supply
a
splitphase
volt
feed
to
your
house
this
works
out
as
two
v
legs
additionally
since
there
are
resistive
voltage
drops
in
the
house
wiring
its
not
unreasonable
to
find
v
has
dropped
to
v
or
v
has
dropped
to
v
by
the
time
the
power
reaches
a
wall
outlet
especially
at
the
end
of
an
extension
cord
or
long
circuit
run
for
a
number
of
reasons
some
historical
some
simple
personal
orneryness
different

slightly
different

this
faq
has
chosen
to
be
consistent
with
calling
them
v
and
v
except
when
actually
saying
what
the
measured
voltage
will
be
confusing
a
bit
just
ignore
it
one
thing
that
might
make
this
a
little
more
understandable
is
that
the
nameplates
on
equipment
ofen
show
the
lower
ie
v
instead
of
v
value
what
this
implies
is
that
the
device
is
designed
to
operate
properly
when
the
voltage
drops
that
low
v
is
not
the
same

what
does
an
electrical
service
look
like
there
are
logically
four
wires
involved
with
supplying
the
main
panel
with
power
three
of
them
will
come
from
the
utility
pole
and
a
fourth
bare
wire
comes
from
elsewhere
the
bare
wire
is
connected
to
one
or
more
long
metal
bars
pounded
into
the
ground
or
to
a
wire
buried
in
the
foundation
or
sometimes
to
the
water
supply

has
to
be
metal
continuous

where
the
main
water
pipe
entering
the
house
watch
out
for
galvanic
action
conductivity
breaks
often
between
copper
and
iron

this
is
the
grounding
conductor
it
is
there
to
make
sure
that
the
third
prong
on
your
outlets
is
connected
to
ground
this
wire
normally
carries
no
current
one
of
the
other
wires
will
be
white
or
black
with

or
yellow
stripes
or
sometimes
simply

is
connected

in
only
one
place
often
inside
the
panel
the
neutral

ground
should
not
be
connected
anywhere
else
otherwise
weird
andor
dangerous
things
may
happen
furthermore
there
should
only
be
one
grounding
system
in
a
home
some
codes
require
more
than
one
grounding
electrode
these
will
be
connected
together
or
connected
to
the
neutral
at
a
common
point
still
one
grounding
system
adding
additional
grounding
electrodes
connected
to
other
portions
of
the
house
wiring
is
unsafe
and
contrary
to
code
if
you
add
a
subpanel
the
ground
and
neutral
are
usually
brought
as
separate
conductors
from
the
main
panel
and
are
not
connected
together
in
the
subpanel
ie
still
only
one
neutralground
connection
however
in
some
situations
certain
categories
of
separate
buildings
you
actually
do
have
to
provide
a
second
grounding
electrode
consult
your
inspector
the
other
two
wires
will
usually
be
black
and
are
the
hot
wires
they
are
attached
to
the
distribution
transformer
as
well
the
two
black
wires
are
degrees
out
of
phase
with
each
other
this
means
if
you
connect
something
to
both
hot
wires
the
voltage
will
be
volts
if
you
connect
something
to
the
white
and
either
of
the
two
blacks
you
will
get
v
some
panels
seem
to
only
have
three
wires
coming
into
them
this
is
either
because
the
neutral
and
ground
are
connected
together
at
a
different
point
eg
the
meter
or
pole
and
one
wire
is
doing
dualduty

note
in

permits
a
circuit
similar
to
be
used
for
stoves

namely
that
there
are
two
hot
wires
and
a
wire
that
does
dual
duty
as
neutral

ground
and
is
connected
to

this
is
crazy
but
the
nfpa
claims
that
this

was
reevaluated
for

and
found
to
be
safe
check
your

in

you
will
sometimes
see

just
a
black

since
the

hot
in
this
case
both
the

cec
requires
that
the

be
permanently
marked
at
the

to
indicate
that
it
is
a

usually
done
with

or
sometimes

each
circuit
is
attached
to
the
main

into

through
a

breaker
or

there
are
in
a
few
locales
circuits
that
look

some
places
require

grounding
versus
grounded
versus
neutral
according
to
the
terminology
in
the
cec
and
nec
the
grounding
conductor
is
for
the
safety
ground
ie
the
green
or
bare
wire
the
word
neutral
is
reserved
for
the
white
when
you
have
a
circuit
with
more
than
one
hot
wire
since
the
white
wire
is
connected
to
neutral
and
the
grounding
conductor
inside
the
panel
the
proper
term
is
grounded
conductor
however
the
potential
confusion
between
grounded
conductor
and
grounding
conductor
can
lead
to
potentially
lethal
mistakes
you
should
never
use
the
bare
wire
as
a
grounded
conductor
or
white
wire
as
the
grounding
conductor
even
though
they
are
connected
together
in
the
panel
but
not
in
subpanels
subpanels
are
fed
neutral
and
ground
separately
from
the
main
panel
usually
in
the
trade
and
in
common
usage
the
word
neutral
is
used
for
grounded
conductor
this
faq
uses
neutral
simply
to
avoid
potential
confusion
we
recommend
that
you
use
neutral
too
thus
the
white
wire
is
always
except
in
some
light
switch
applications
neutral
not
ground
subject
what
does
a
fuse
or
breaker
do
what
are
the
differences
fuses
and
circuit
breakers
are
designed
to
interrupt
the
power
to
a
circuit
when
the
current
flow
exceeds
safe
levels
for
example
if
your
toaster
shorts
out
a
fuse
or
breaker
should
trip
protecting
the
wiring
in
the
walls
from
melting
as
such
fuses
and
breakers
are
primarily
intended
to
protect
the
wiring
ul
or
csa
approval
supposedly
indicates
that
the
equipment
itself
wont
cause
a
fire
fuses
contain
a
narrow
strip
of
metal
which
is
designed
to
melt
safely
when
the
current
exceeds
the
rated
value
thereby
interrupting
the
power
to
the
circuit
fuses
trip
relatively
fast
which
can
sometimes
be
a
problem
with
motors
which
have
large
startup
current
surges
for
motor
circuits
you
can
use
a
timedelay
fuse
one
brand
is
fusetron
which
will
avoid
tripping
on
momentary
overloads
a
fusetron
looks
like
a
springloaded
fuse
a
fuse
can
only
trip
once
then
it
must
be
replaced
breakers
are
fairly
complicated
mechanical
devices
they
usually
consist
of
one
spring
loaded
contact
which
is
latched
into
position
against
another
contact
when
the
current
flow
through
the
device
exceeds
the
rated
value
a
bimetallic
strip
heats
up
and
bends
by
bending
it
trips
the
latch
and
the
spring
pulls
the
contacts
apart
circuit
breakers
behave
similarly
to
fusetrons
that
is
they
tend
to
take
longer
to
trip
at
moderate
overloads
than
ordinary
fuses
with
high
overloads
they
trip
quickly
breakers
can
be
reset
a
finite
number
of
times
each
time
they
trip
or
are
thrown
when
the
circuit
is
in
use
some
arcing
takes
place
which
damages
the
contacts
thus
breakers
should
not
be
used
in
place
of
switches
unless
they
are
specially
listed
for
the
purpose
neither
fuses
nor
breakers
limit
the
current
per
se
a
dead
short
on
a
circuit
can
cause
hundreds
or
sometimes
even
thousands
of
amperes
to
flow
for
a
short
period
of
time
which
can
often
cause
severe
damage
subject
breakers
cant
i
use
fuses
statistics
show
that
fuse
panels
have
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
causing
a
fire
than
breaker
panels
this
is
usually
due
to
the
fuse
being
loosely
screwed
in
or
the
contacts
corroding
and
heating
up
over
time
or
the
wrong
size
fuse
being
installed
or
the
proverbial
replace
the
fuse
with
a
penny
trick
since
breakers
are
more
permanently
installed
and
have
better
connection
mechanisms
the
risk
of
fire
is
considerably
less
fuses
are
prone
to
explode
under
extremely
high
overload
when
a

dont
do
this
many
jurisdictions
particularly
in
canada
no
longer
permit
fuse
panels
in
new
installations
the

does
permit
new
fuse
panels
in
some
rare
circumstances
requiring
the
special
inserts
to
key
the

fuses
some
devices
notably
certain
large
air
conditioners
require
fuse
protection
in
addition
to
the
breaker

the
panel
the
fuse
is
there
to
protect
the
motor
windings
from
overload
check
the

getting
very

precise

subject
where
do
these
numbers
come
from
there
are
two
considerations
voltage
drop
and
heat
buildup
the
smaller
the
wire
is
the
higher
the
resistance
is
when
the
resistance
is
higher
the
wire
heats
up
more
and
there
is
more
voltage
drop
in
the
wiring
the
former
is
why
you
need
highertemperature
insulation
andor
bigger
wires
for
use
in
conduit
the
latter
is
why
you
should
use
larger
wire
for
long
runs
neither
effect
is
very
significant
over
very
short
distances
there
are
some
very
specific
exceptions
where
use
of
smaller
wire
is
allowed
the
obvious
one
is
the
line
cord
on
most

dont
try
this

of
those
exceptions
you

you
strip

some

advertise

this
is
probably
not
a
good
idea
the

may
tear

usually
done

if
they
differ
by
more
than
a
few
milliamps
the
presumption
is
that
current
is
leaking
to
ground
via
some
other
path
this
may
be
because
of
a
short
circuit
to
the
chassis
of
an
appliance
or
to
the
ground
lead
or
through
a
person
any
of
these
situations
is
hazardous
so
the
gfci
trips
breaking
the
circuit
gfcis
do
not
protect
against
all
kinds
of
electric
shocks
if
for
example
you
simultaneously
touched
the
hot
and
neutral
leads
of
a
circuit
and
no
part
of
you
was
grounded
a
gfci
wouldnt
help
all
of
the
current
that
passed
from
the
hot
lead
into
you
would
return
via
the
neutral
lead
keeping
the
gfci
happy
the
two
pairs
of
connections
on
a
gfci
outlet
are
not
symmetric
one
is
labeled
load
the
other
line
the
incoming
power
feed
must
be
connected
to
the
line
side
or
the
outlet
will
not
be
protected
the
load
side
can
be
used
to
protect
all
devices
downstream
from
it
thus
a
whole
string
of
outlets
can
be
covered
by
a
single
gfci
outlet
subject
where
should
gfcis
be
used

there
are

for

those
dedicated
to

typically
refrigerators
and
freezers
and
for

the

there
is
no
requirement
to
protect
kitchen
outlets
or
most

basement
outlets
must

if
you
have
a
dirt

garage
outlets
if
theyre

and
most
exterior

even
if

not
required

you
may
want
to
consider
installing
it
anyway
unless
you
need

subject
where
shouldnt

gfcis
are
generally
not
used
on
circuits
that
a
dont
pose
a
safety
risk
and
b
are
used
to
power
equipment
that
must
run
unattended
for
long
periods
of
time
refrigerators
freezers
and
sump
pumps
are
good
examples
the
rationale
is
that
gfcis
are
sometimes
prone
to
nuisance
trips
some
people
claim
that
the
inductive
delay
in
motor
windings
can
cause
a
momentary
current
imbalance
tripping
the
gfci
note
though
that
most
gfci
trips
are
real
if
youre
getting
a
lot
of
trips
for
no
apparent
reason
youd
be
welladvised
to
check
your
wiring
before
deciding
that
the
gfci
is
broken
or
useless
subject
what
is
the
difference
between
a
gfci
outlet
and
a
gfci
breaker
for
most
situations
you
can
use
either
a
gfci
outlet
as
the
first
device
on
the
circuit
or
you
can
install
a
breaker
with
a
builtin
gfci
the
former
is
generally
preferred
since
gfci
breakers
are
quite
expensive
for
example
an
ordinary
ge
breaker
costs
us
the
gfci
model
costs
us
there
is
one
major
exception
if
you
need
to
protect
a
multiwire
branch
circuit
two
or
more
circuits
sharing
a
common
neutral
wire
such
as
a
canadianstyle
kitchen
circuit
youll
need
a
multipole
gfci
breaker
unfortunately
these
are
expensive
the
cost
can
range
into
the
hundreds
of
dollars
depending
on
what
brand
of
panel
box
you
have
but
if
you
must
protect
such
a
circuit
say
for
a
pool
heater
you
have
no
choice
one
more
caveat
gfci
outlets
are
bulky
you
may
want
to
use
an
oversize
box
when
installing
them
on
second
thought
use
large
actually
deep
boxes
everywhere
youll
thank
yourself
for
it
incidentally
if
youre
installing
a
gfci
to
ensure
that
one
specific
outlet
is
protected
such
as
a
bathroom
you
dont
really
have
to
go
to
all
of
the
trouble
to
find
the
first
outlet
in
the
circuit
you
could
simply
find
the
first
outlet
in
the
bathroom
and
not
gfci
anything
upstream
of
it
but
protecting
the
whole
circuit
is
preferred
when
you
install
a
gfci
its
a
good
idea
to
use
the
little
ground
fault
protected
stickers
that
come
with
it
and
mark
the
outlets
downstream
of
the
gfci
you
can
figure
out
which
outlets
are
downstream
simply
by
tripping
the
gfci
with
the
test
button
and
see
which
outlets
are
dead
subject
whats
the
purpose
of
the
ground
prong
on
an
outlet
then
apart
from
their
use
in
electronics
which
we
wont
comment
on
and
for
certain
fluorescent
lights
they
wont
turn
on
without
a
good
ground
connection
theyre
intended
to
guard
against
insulation
failures
within
the
device
generally
the
case
of
the
appliance
is
connected
to
the
ground
lead
if
theres
an
insulation
failure
that
shorts
the
hot
lead
to
the
case
the
ground
lead
conducts
the
electricity
away
safely
and
possibly
trips
the
circuit
breaker
in
the
process
if
the
case
is
not
grounded
and
such
a
short
occurs
the
case
is
live
and
if
you
touch
it
while
youre
grounded
youll
get
zapped
of
course
if
the
circuit
is
gfciprotected
it
will
be
a
very
tiny
zap
which
is
why
you
can
use
gfcis
to
replace
ungrounded
outlets
both
nec
and
cec
there
are
some
appliances
that
should
never
be
grounded
in
particular
that
applies
to
toasters
and
anything
else
with
exposed
conductors
consider
if
you
touch
the
heating
electrode
in
a
toaster
and
youre
not
grounded
nothing
will
happen
if
youre
slightly
grounded
youll
get
a
small
shock
the
resistance
will
be
too
high
but
if
the
case
were
grounded
and
you
were
holding
it
youd
be
the
perfect
path
to
ground
subject
why
is
one
prong
wider
than
the
other
polarization
nowadays
many
twoprong
devices
have
one
prong
wider
than
the
other
this
is
so
that
the
device
could
rely
not
guaranteed
on
one
specific
wire
being
neutral
and
the
other
hot
this
is
particularly
advantageous
in
light

devices
which
want
to
have
an
approximate
ground
reference

wide
prongs
too
this
requires
that
you
wire
your
outlets
and
plugs
the
right
way
around
you
want
the
wide
prong
to
be
neutral
and
the

is
simple
with

the

dont

the

the

one
should
check
the
amperage
rating

if
your
heart
is
set
on
installing
half
a
dozen
watt
floodlights
you
may
need
to
run
a
new
wire
back
to
the
panel
box
but
there
are
some
more
subtle
constraints
as
well
for
example
older
house
wiring
doesnt
have
hightemperature
insulation
the
excess
heat
generated
by
a
ceilingmounted
lamp
can
and
will
cause
the
insulation
to
deteriorate
and
crack
with
obvious
bad
results
some
newer
fixtures
are
specifically
marked
for
high
temperature
wire
only
you
may
find
in
fact
that
your
ceiling
wiring
already
has
this
problem
in
which
case
replacing
any
devices
is
a
real
adventure
other
concerns
include
providing
a
suitable
ground
for
some
fluorescent
fixtures
and
making
sure
that
the
ceiling
box
and
its
mounting
are
strong
enough
to
support
the
weight
of
a
heavy
chandelier
or
ceiling
fan
you
may
need
to
install
a
new
box
specifically
listed
for
this
purpose
a
x
across
the
ceiling
joists
makes
a
good
support
metal
brackets
are
also
available
that
can
be
fished
into
ceilings
thru
the
junction
box
hole
and
mounted
between
the
joists
there
are
special
rules
for
recessed
light
fixtures
such
as
pot
lamps
or
heat
lamps
when
these
are
installed
in
insulated
ceilings
they
can
present
a
very
substantial
fire
hazard
the
cec
provides
for
the
installation
of
pot
lamps
in
insulated

provided
that
the

made

have
any
insulation
yes
thats
feet
long
nec
rules
are
somewhat
less
stringent
they
require
at
least
clearance
between
the
fixture
and
any
sort
of
thermal
insulation
the
rules
also
say
that
one
should
not
obstruct
free
air
movement
which
means
that
a
cecstyle
coffin
might
be
worthwhile
presumably
thats
up
to
the
local
inspector
the
cec
doesnt
actually
mandate
the
coffin
perse
this
seems
to
be
an
inspector
requirement
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
the
fixture
cant
get
accidentally
buried
in
insulation
ie
if
you
have
insulation
blown
in
later
there
are
now
fixtures
that
contain
integral
thermal
cutouts
and
fairly
large
cases
that
can
be
buried
directly
in
insulation
they
are
usually
limited
to
watt
bulbs
and
are
unfortunately
somewhat
more
expensive
than
the
older
types
before
you
use
them
you
should
ensure
that
they
have
explicit
ul
or
csa
approval
for
such
uses
follow
the
installation
instructions
carefully
the
prescribed
location
for
the
sensor
can
vary
there
does
not
yet
appear
to
be
a
heat
lamp
fixture
that
is
approved
for
use
in
insulation
the
coffin
appears
the
only
legal
approach
subject
what
does
it
mean
when
the
lights
brighten
when
a
motor
starts
this
usually
means
that
the
neutral
wire
in
the
panel
is
loose
depending
on
the
load
balance
one
hot
wire
may
end
up
being
more
than
v
and
the
other
less
than
v
with
respect
to
ground
this
is
a
very
hazardous
situation
it
can
destroy
your
electronic
equipment
possibly
start
fires
and
in
some
situations
electrocute
you
ie
some
us
jurisdictions
require
the
stove
frame
connected
to
neutral
if
this
happens
contact
your
electrical
authority
immediately
and
have
them
come
and
check
out
the
problem
note
a
brief
second
brightening
is
sometimes
normal
with
lighting
and
motors
on
the
same
v
with
neutral
circuit
a
loose
main
panel
neutral
will
usually
show
increased
brightness
far
longer
than
one
second
in
case
of
doubt
get
help
subject
what
is
phase
power
should
i
use
it
can
i
get
it
in
my
house
three
phase
power
has
three
hot
wires
degrees
out
of
phase
with
each
other
these
are
usually
used
for
large
motors
because
it
is
more
efficient
provides
a
bit
more
starting
torque
and
because
the
motors
are
simpler
and
hence
cheaper
youre
most
likely
to
encounter
a
phase
circuit
that
shows
volts
between
any
hot
and
ground
and
volts
between
any
two
hots
the
latter
shows
the
difference
between
a
normal
vv
common
neutral
circuit
which
is
volts
between
the
two
hots
there
are
phase
circuits
with
different
voltages
bringing
in
a
phase
feed
to
your
house
is
usually
ridiculously
expensive
or
impossible
if
the
equipment
you
want
to
run
has
a
standard
motor
mount
it
is
much
cheaper
to
buy
a
new
v
or
v
motor
for
it
in
some
cases
it
is
possible
to
run
phase
equipment
on
ordinary
power
if
you
have
a
capacitor
start
unit
or
use
a
larger
motor
as
a
autogenerator
these
are
tricky
but
are
a
good
solution
if
the
motor
is
nonstandard
size
or
too
expensive
or
too
big
to
replace
the
taunton
press
book
the
small
shop
has
an
article
on
how
to
do
this
if
you
must
note
that
you
lose
any
possible
electrical
efficiency
by
using
such
a
converter
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
guarantee
that
subject
is
it
better
to
run
motors
at
or
theoretically
it
doesnt
make
any
difference
however
there
is
a
difference
is
the
amount
of
power
lost
in
the
supply
wiring
all
things
being
equal
a
v
motor
will
lose
times
less
power
in
the
house
wiring
than
a
v
motor
this
also
means
that
the
startup
surge
loss
will
be
less
and
the
motor
will
get
to
speed
quicker
and
in
some
circumstances
the
smaller
power
loss
will
lead
to
longer
motor
life
this
is
usually
irrelevant
unless
the
supply
wires
are
more
than
feet
long
subject
what
is
this
nonsense
about
hp
on
v
a
circuits
it
is
a
universal
physical
law
that
hp
is
equal
to
watts
given
heating
loss
power
factor
and
other
inefficiencies
it
is
usually
best
to
consider
hp
is
going
to
need
watts
a
v
a
circuit
can
only
deliver
watts
to
a
motor
so
it
can
not
possibly
be
more
than
approximately
hp
given
rational
efficiency
factors
hp
is
more
like
it
some
equipment
manufacturers
sears
in
particular
most
router
manufacturers
in
general
advertise
a
hp
rating
that
is
far
in
excess
of
what
is
possible
they
are
giving
you
a
stall
horsepower
or
similar
that
means
the
power
is
measured
when
the
motor
is
just
about
to
stop
turning
because
of
the
load
what
they
dont
mention
is
that
if
you
kept
it
in
that
condition
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
hopefully
your
breaker
will
trip
otherwise
the
motor
will
melt
its
drawing
far
more
current
than
it
can
continuously
when
comparing
motors
compare
the
continuous
horsepower
this
should
be
on
the
motor
nameplate
if
you
cant
find
that
figure
check
the
amperage
rating
which
is
always
present
subject
how
do
i
convert
two
prong
receptacles
to
three
prong
older
homes
frequently
have
twoprong
receptacles
instead
of
the
more
modern
three
these
receptacles
have
no
safety
ground
and
the
cabling
usually
has
no
ground
wire
neither
the
nec
or
cec
permits
installing
new
prong
receptacles
anymore
there
are
several
different
approaches
to
solving
this
if
the
wiring
is
done
through
conduit
or
bx
and
the
conduit
is
continuous
back
to
the
panel
you
can
connect
the
third
prong
of
a
new
receptacle
to
the
receptacle
box
nec
mainly
cec
frowns
on
this
practise
if
there
is
a
copper
cold
water
pipe
going
nearby
and
its
continuous
to
the
main
house
ground
point
you
can
run
a
conductor
to
it
from
the
third
prong
run
a
ground
conductor
back
to
the
main
panel
easiest
install
a
gfci
receptacle
the
ground
lug
should
not
be
connected
to
anything
but
the
gfci
protection
itself
will
serve
instead
the
gfci
will
also
protect
downstream
possibly
also
two
prong
outlets
if
you
do
this
to
protect
downstream
outlets
the
grounds
must
not
be
connected
together
since
it
wouldnt
be
connected
to
a
real
ground
a
wiring
fault
could
energize
the
cases
of
prong
devices
connected
to
other
outlets
be
sure
though
that
there
arent
indirect
ground
plug
connections
such
as
via
the
sheath
on
bx
cable
the
cec
permits
you
to
replace
a
two
prong
receptacle
with
a
three
prong
if
you
fill
the
u
ground
with
a
nonconducting
goop
like
caulking
compound
this
is
not
permitted
in
the
nec
subject
are
you
sure
about
gfcis
and
ungrounded
outlets
should
the
test
button
work
were
sure
about
what
the
nec
and
cec
say
remember
though
that
your
local
codes
may
vary
as
for
the
test
button
theres
a
resistor
connecting
the
load
side
of
the
hot
wire
to
the
line
side
of
the
neutral
wire
when
you
press
the
test
button
current
through
this
resistor
shows
up
as
an
imbalance
and
trips
the
gfci
this
is
a
simple
passive
and
reliable
test
and
doesnt
require
a
real
ground
to
work
if
your
gfci
does
not
trip
when
you
press
the
test
button
it
is
very
probably
defective
or
miswired
again
if
the
test
button
doesnt
work
somethings
broken
and
potentially
dangerous
the
problem
should
be
corrected
immediately
the
instructions
that
come
with
some
gfcis
specify
that
the
ground
wire
must
be
connected
we
do
not
know
why
they
say
this
the
causes
may
be
as
mundane
as
an
old
instruction
sheet
or
with
the
formalities
of
ul
or
csa
listing
perhaps
the
device
was
never
tested
without
the
ground
wire
being
connected
on
the
other
hand
ul
or
csa
approval
should
only
have
been
granted
if
the
device
behaves
properly
in
all
listed
applications
including
ungrounded
outlet
replacement
one
of
us
called
leviton
their
gfcis
are
labeled
for
installation
on
grounded
circuits
only
the
technician
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
agreed
that
the
nec
does
not
require
it
and
promised
to
investigate
subject
how
should
i
wire
my
shop
as
with
any
other
kind
of
wiring
you
need
enough
power
for
all
devices
that
will
be
on
simultaneously
the
code
specifies
that
you
should
stay
under
of
the
nominal
capacity
of
the
circuit
for
typical
home
shop
use
this
means
one
circuit
for
the
major
power
tools
and
possibly
one
for
a
dust
collector
or
shop
vac
use
at
least
gauge
wire
many
power
tools
have
big
motors
with
a
big
startup
surge
if
you
can
use
amp
breakers
nec
though
cec
requires
standard
a
receptacles
which
means
youd
have
to
replug
all
your
equipment
lights
should
either
be
on
a
circuit
of
their
own
and
not
shared
with
circuits
in
the
rest
of
the
house
or
be
on
at
least
two
separate
circuits
the
idea
is
that
you
want
to
avoid
a
situation
where
a
blade
is
still
spinning
at
several
thousand
rpm
while
youre
groping
in
the
dark
for
the
off
switch
do
install
lots
of
outlets
its
easier
to
install
them
in
the
beginning
when
you
dont
have
to
cut
into
an
existing
cable
its
useful
if
at
least
two
circuits
are
accessible
at
each
point
so
you
can
run
a
shop
vac
or
a
compressor
at
the
same
time
as
the
tool
you
really
want
but
use
metal
boxes
and
plates
and
maybe
even
metalsheathed
cable
you
may
have
objects
flying
around
at
high
speeds
if
something
goes
a
bit
wrong
note
that
some
jurisdictions
have
a
no
horizontal
wiring
rule
in
workshops
or
other
unfinished
areas
that
are
used
for
working
what
this
means
is
that
all
wiring
must
be
run
along
structural
members
ie
stapled
to
studs
other
possible
shop
circuits
include
heater
circuits
v
circuits
for
some
large
tools
and
air
compressor
circuits
dont
overload
circuits
and
dont
use
extension
cords
if
you
can
help
it
unless
theyre
rated
for
high
currents
a
coiled
extension
cord
is
not
as
safe
as
a
straight
length
of
wire
of
the
same
gauge
also
the
insulation
wont
withstand
as
much
heat
and
heat
dissipation
is
the
critical
issue
if
your
shop
is
located
at
some
remove
from
your
main
panel
you
should
probably
install
a
subpanel
and
derive
your
shop
wiring
from
it
if
you
have
young
children
you
may
want
to
equip
this
panel
with
a
cutoff
switch
and
possibly
a
lock
if
you
want
to
install
individual
switches
to
safe
particular
circuits
make
sure
you
get
ones
rated
high
enough
for
example
ordinary
light
switches
are
not
safely
able
to
handle
the
startup
surge
generated
by
a
table
saw
buy
horsepowerrated
switches
instead
finally
note
that
most
home
shops
are
in
garages
or
unfinished
basements
hence
the
nec
requirements
for
gfcis
apply
and
even
if
you
know
that
youd
never
use
one
of
your
shop
outlets
to
run
a
lawn
mower
the
next
owner
of
your
house
might
have
a
different
idea
note
fine
woodworking
magazine
often
carries
articles
on
shop
wiring
april
is
one
place
to
start
subject
underground
wiring
you
will
need
to
prepare
a
trench
to
specifications
use
special
wire
protect
the
wire
with
conduit
or
special
plastic
tubing
and
possibly
lumber
dont
use
creosoted
lumber
it
rots
thermoplastic
insulation
and
acts
as
a
catalyst
in
the
corrosion
of
lead
the
transition
from
inhouse
to
underground
wire
is
generally
via
conduit
all
outdoor
boxes
must
be
specifically
listed
for
the
purpose
and
contain
the
appropriate
gaskets
fittings
etc
if
the
location
of
the
box
is
subject
to
immersion
in
water
a
more
serious
style
of
waterproof
box
is
needed
and
of
course
dont
forget
the
gfcis
the
required
depths
and
other
details
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
so
we
suggest
you
consult
your
inspector
about
your
specific
situation
a
hint
buy
a
roll
of
bright
yellow
tape
that
says
buried
power
line
and
bury
it
a
few
inches
above
where
the
wire
has
been
placed
subject
aluminum
wiring
during
the
s
aluminum
instead
of
copper
wiring
became
quite
popular
and
was
extensively
used
since
that
time
aluminum
wiring
has
been
implicated
in
a
number
of
house
fires
and
most
jurisdictions
no
longer
permit
it
in
new
installations
we
recommend
even
if
youre
allowed
to
that
do
not
use
it
for
new
wiring
but
dont
panic
if
your
house
has
aluminum
wiring
aluminum
wiring
when
properly
installed
can
be
just
as
safe
as
copper
aluminum
wiring
is
however
very
unforgiving
of
improper
installation
we
will
cover
a
bit
of
the
theory
behind
potential
problems
and
what
you
can
do
to
make
your
wiring
safe
the
main
problem
with
aluminum
wiring
is
a
phenomenon
known
as
cold
creep
when
aluminum
wiring
warms
up
it
expands
when
it
cools
down
it
contracts
unlike
copper
when
aluminum
goes
through
a
number
of
warmcool
cycles
it
loses
a
bit
of
tightness
each
time
to
make
the
problem
worse
aluminum
oxidises
or
corrodes
when
in
contact
with
certain
types
of
metal
so
the
resistance
of
the
connection
goes
up
which
causes
it
to
heat
up
and
corrode
oxidize
still
more
eventually
the
wire
may
start
getting
very
hot
melt
the
insulation
or
fixture
its
attached
to
and
possibly
even
cause
a
fire
since
people
usually
encounter
aluminum
wiring
when
they
move
into
a
house
built
during
the
s
we
will
cover
basic
points
of
safe
aluminum
wiring
we
suggest
that
if
youre
considering
purchasing
a
home
with
aluminum
wiring
or
have
discovered
it
later
that
you
hire
a
licensed
electrician
or
inspector
to
check
over
the
wiring
for
the
following
things
fixtures
eg
outlets
and
switches
directly
attached
to
aluminum
wiring
should
be
rated
for
it
the
device
will
be
stamped
with
alcu
or
coalr
the
latter
supersedes
the
former
but
both
are
safe
these
fixtures
are
somewhat
more
expensive
than
the
ordinary
ones
wires
should
be
properly
connected
at
least
way
around
the
screw
in
a
clockwise
direction
connections
should
be
tight
while
repeated
tightening
of
the
screws
can
make
the
problem
worse
during
the
inspection
it
would
pay
off
to
snug
up
each
connection
note
that
aluminum
wiring
is
still
often
used
for
the
main
service
entrance
cable
it
should
be
inspected
pushin
terminals
are
an
extreme
hazard
with
aluminum
wire
any
connections
using
pushin
terminals
should
be
redone
with
the
proper
screw
connections
immediately
there
should
be
no
signs
of
overheating
darkened
connections
melted
insulation
or
baked
fixtures
any
such
damage
should
be
repaired
connections
between
aluminum
and
copper
wire
need
to
be
handled
specially
current
canadian
codes
require
that
the
wire
nut
used
must
be
specially
marked
for
connecting
aluminum
to
copper
the
nec
requires
that
the
wire
be
connected
together
using
special
crimp
devices
with
an
antioxidant
grease
the
tools
and
materials
for
the
latter
are
quite
expensive
not
practical
to
do
it
yourself
unless
you
can
rent
the
tool
any
nonrated
receptacle
can
be
connected
to
aluminum
wiring
by
means
of
a
short
copper
pigtail
see
above
shows
reasonable
workmanship
neat
wiring
properly
stripped
not
nicked
wire
etc
if
when
considering
purchasing
a
home
an
inspection
of
the
wiring
shows
no
problems
or
only
one
or
two
we
believe
that
you
can
consider
the
wiring
safe
if
there
are
signs
of
problems
in
many
places
we
suggest
you
look
elsewhere
if
the
wrong
receptacles
are
used
you
can
replace
them
with
the
proper
type
or
use
pigtails
having
this
professionally
done
can
range
from
to
per
receptacleswitch
you
can
do
this
yourself
too
subject
im
buying
a
house
what
should
i
do
congratulations
but
its
generally
a
good
idea
to
hire
an
inspector
to
look
through
the
house
for
hidden
gotchas
not
just
for
wiring
but
plumbing
and
structural
as
well
if
an
inspection
of
the
wiring
shows
no
problems
or
only
one
or
two
minor
ones
we
believe
that
you
can
consider
the
wiring
safe
after
any
minor
problems
are
fixed
if
there
are
signs
of
problems
in
many
places
we
suggest
you
look
elsewhere
heres
some
hints
on
what
to
look
for
obvious
noncode

can
include
zip
cord
wiring
either
concealed

hot

what
is
this
weird
stuff
old
style
wiring
in
the
years
since
edison
invented
electricity
several
different
wiring
styles
have
come
and
gone
when
you
buy
an
older
home
you
may
encounter
some
of
this
stuff
this
section
describes
the
old
methods
and
some
of
their
idiosyncrasies
the
oldest
wiring
system
youre
likely
to
encounter
is
called
knob
and
tube
kt
it
is
made
up
of
individual
conductors
with
a
cloth
insulation
the
wires
are
run
along
side
structural
members
eg
joists
or
studs
using
ceramic
standoffs
knobs
wire
is
run
through
structural
members
using
ceramic
tubes
connections
were
made
by
twisting
the
wire
together
soldering
and
wrapping
with
tape
since
the
hot
and
neutral
were
run
separately
the
wiring
tends
to
be
rather
confusing
a
neutral
often
runs
down
the
centre
of
each
room
with
taps
off
to
each
fixture
the
hot
wire
tended
to
run
from
one
fixture
to
the
next
in
some
cases
kt
isnt
colourcoded
so
the
neutral
is
often
the
same
colour
as
the
hot
wires
youll
see
kt
in
homes
built
as
late
as
the
s
comments
on
kt
the
people
installing
kt
were
pretty
paranoid
about
electricity
so
the
workmanship
tends
to
be
pretty
good
the
wire
insulation
and
insulators
tend
to
stand
up
very
well
most
kt
ive
seen
for
example
is
in
quite
good
condition
no
grounding
grounding
is
usually
difficult
to
install
boxes
are
small
receptacle
replacement
particularly
with
gfci
can
be
difficult
no
bushing
on
boxes
either
so
wiring
changes
need
special
attention
to
box
entry
sometimes
the
neutral
isnt
balanced
very
well
between
separately
hot
circuits
so
it
is
sometimes
possible
to
overload
the
neutral
without
exceeding
the
fusing
on
any
circuit
building
code
does
not
permit
insulation
in
walls
that
contain
kt
connection
to
existing
kt
from
new
circuits
can
be
tricky
consult
your
inspector
modern
wiring
practise
requires
considerably
more
outlets
to
be
installed
than
kt
systems
did
since
kt
tends
to
be
in
pretty
decent
condition
it
generally
isnt
necessary
to
replace
it
simply
because
its
kt
what
you
should
watch
out
for
is
renovations
that
have
interfered
with
it
and
be
cautious
about
circuit
loading
in
many
cases
its
perfectly
reasonable
to
leave
existing
kt
alone
and
add
new
fixtures
on
new
circuits
using
modern
techniques
after
kt
they
invented
multiconductor
cable
the
first
type
you
will
see
is
roughly
a
cloth
and
varnish
insulation
it
looks
much
like
the
romex
cable
of
the
last
decade
or
two
this
stuff
was
used
in
the
s
and
s
again
no
grounding
conductor
it
was
installed
much
like
modern
wiring
its
major
drawback
is
that
this
type
of
insulation
embrittles
weve
seen
whole
systems
where
the
insulation
would
fracture
and
fall
off
at
a
touch
bx
cable
of
the
same
vintage
has
similar
problems
this
stuff
is
very
fragile
and
becomes
rather
hazardous
if
the
wires
become
bare
this
wiring
should
be
left
untouched
as
much
as
possible
whenever
an
opportunity
arises
replace
it
a
simple
receptacle
or
switch
replacement
can
turn
into
a
several
hour
long
frustrating
fight
with
electrical
tape
or
heatshrink
tubing
after
this
wiring
technique
the
more
modern
romex
was
invented
its
almost
a
asphalt
impregnated
cloth
often
a
bit
sticky
this
stuff
stands
up
reasonably
well
and
doesnt
present
a
hazard
and
is
reasonably
easy
to
work
with
it
does
not
need
to
be
replaced
it
should
be
considered
as
safe
as
the
modern
stuff
thermoplastic
insulation
wire
just
dont
abuse
it
too
much
subject
where
do
i
buy
stuff
try
to
find
a
proper
electrical
supply
outlet
near
you
their
prices
will
often
be
considerably
better
than
chain
hardware
stores
or
diy
centres
have
better
quality
materials
have
wider
variety
including
the
odd
stuff
and
have
people
behind
the
counter
that
know
what
youre
talking
about
cultivate
friendly
knowledgeable

people
theyll
give
you
much
