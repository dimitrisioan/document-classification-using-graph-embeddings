the
supra
accelerator
that
is
mentioned
in
one
of
the
pervious
articles
is
not
or
based
it
runs
on
a
at
mhz
and
the
design
they
are
using
is
very
simple
if
you
were
referring
to
the
a
exteranal
model
hmm
i
dont
think
you
and
i
are
thinking
of
the
same
thing
i
was
the
original
poster
btw
the
accelerator
that
im
talking
about
almost
certainly
uses
a
hc
according
to
the
footnotes
in
the
supra
ad
it
only
costs
list
so
i
really
doubt
if
it
has
a
mhz
inside
its
called
the
supra
or
supra
turbo
theres
an
external
a
model
and
an
internal
a
model

mhz
hc
exists
