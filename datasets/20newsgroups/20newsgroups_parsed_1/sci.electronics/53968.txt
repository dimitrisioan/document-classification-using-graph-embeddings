for
a
project
of
my
own
i
would
like
to
build
a
infrared
remote
control
receiver
for
regular
vcrs
and
tvs
remotes
does
anybody
have
any
info
or
tips
on
how
to
build
such
receiver
in
particular
a
which
photo
detector
should
i
use
which
wavelength
do
remotes
use
b
which
ics
or
circuit
should
i
use
c
any
suggestions
for
circuit
layout
another
suggestion
find
a
brand
of
tv
that
uses
an
ir
remote
and
go
look
at
the
sams
photofact
for
it
you
can
often
find
some
very
detailed
schematics
and
parts
list
for
not
only
the
receiver
but
the
transmitter
as
well
including
carrier
freq
specs
and
tone
decoding
specs
if
the
system
uses
that
probably
wont
help
id
be
willing
to
bet
that
every
manufacturer
used
those
little
selfcontained
modules
i
think
sharp
made
them
radio
shack
used
to
sell
them
for
a
few
bucks
maybe
they
still
do
the
module
had
leads
power
ground
and
demodulated
output
it
contained
the
photodetector
amplifier
integrator
and
demodulator
all
in
a
tiny
metal
can
if
you
want
to
buy
one
try
radio
shack
or
else
a
tv
repair
shop
can
probably
order
one
btw
the
carrier
frequency
is
khz
and
each
different
tvvcrcable
boxstereo
manufacturer
uses
a
unique
pulse
scheme
to
perform
each
different
function
on
their
equipment
jim
ritterbusch
or
temp
rf
there
is
an
art
the
guide
says
or
rather
a
knack
to
flying
the
knack
lies
in
learning
how
to
throw
yourself
at
the
ground
and
miss
