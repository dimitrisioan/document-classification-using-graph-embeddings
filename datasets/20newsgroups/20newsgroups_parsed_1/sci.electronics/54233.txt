re
how
to
drive
an
array
of
leds
phil

i
have
a
project
in
mind
that
requires
an
array
of
leds
that
can
be
addressed
individually
by
a
microprocessor
say
x
or
so
is
there
an
lsi
that
is
designed
to
drive
an
led
array
including
ram
to
hold
the
array
state
or
failing
that
some
way
of
multiplexing
the
display
so
i
dont
have
to
latch
a
bit
for
each
led
using
a
discrete
latch
i
want
to
avoid
having
a
huge
board
covered
with
s
if
possible
thanks
in
advance
maxim
makes
a
chip
that
does
exactly
what
you
want
the
max
drives
segment
led
displays
with
full
decode
or
drives
discrete
leds
with
a
wire
serial
interface
the
chips
can
also
be
cascaded
to
allow
very
large
arrays
i
am
working
on
a
sign
display
using
this
part
ill
have
to
post
the
contact
info
for
maxim
later
its
at
home
there
was
a
series
of
articles
on
this
chip
in
the
last
couple
of
