what
do
nuclear
sites
cooling
towers
do
i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
i
hope
someone
can
help
