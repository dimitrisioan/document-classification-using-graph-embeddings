this
is
not
a
new
idea
at
least
years
ago
i
got
this
little
gadget
with
a
keyboard
on
the
back
and
leds
in
a
vertical
row
on
the
front
it
has
a
long
handle
and
when
you
wave
it
in
the
air
it
writes
the
message
you
typed
on
the
keyboard
in
the
air
this
is
not
news
in
fact
its
where
i
got
the
idea
from
since
it
was
such
a
neat
item
mattell
made
it
i
believe
modeled
after
a
space
saber
or
light
sword
or
something
likewise
themey
my
addition
was
using
a
motor
for
continuous
display
and
polar
effects
in
addition
to
character
graphics
i
should
have
protected
it
when
i
had
the
chance
no
one
to
kick
but
myself
ten
years
ago
is
about
right
since
i
built
mine
in
or
its
even
older
than
that
i
remember
seeing
a
description
of
a
garage
operation
selling
them
at
some
of
the
early
computer
faires
in
san
francisco
about
years
before
that
