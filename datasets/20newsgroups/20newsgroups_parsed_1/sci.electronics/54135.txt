so
whats
the
story
here
were
all
stuck
with
the
regular
green
red
and
off
yelloworange
leds
what
gives
anybody
have
a
scoop
on
fairly
low
priced
blue
leds
in
order
to
emit
blue
light
a
semiconductor
must
have
a
band
gap
energy
within
the
region
of
to
electron
volts
according
to
my
physical
electronics
prof
you
cant
get
an
led
with
that
band
gap
thats
why
you
hes
mistaken
they
exist
the
semiconductor
is
silicon
carbide
and
they
are
inefficient
and
expensive
the
bandgap
is
around
ev
dont
find
blue
leds
or
for
that
matter
some
other
colour
of
leds
that
is
not
to
say
that
blue
leds
cant
be
found
ive
seen
blue
leds
sold
but
they
were
just
your
typical
visible
light
led
in
a
blue
plastic
covering
they
didnt
emit
very
much
light
the
ones
i
have
are
clear
plastic
pray
tell
what
would
make
a
typical
led
emit
blue
light
