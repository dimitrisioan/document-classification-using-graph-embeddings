there
are
two
simple
procedures
for
alterating
any
odometer
mechanical
driven
odometer
remove
the
speedo
cable
from
the
transmission
attach
a
drill
and
run
at
max
speed
until
the
speedo
turns
over
continue
until
the
desired
mileage
is
reached
admittedly
an
irrelavent
questionfor
how
long
should
the
drill
be
running
bijan
a
verrrrrry
long
time
like
on
the
order
of
days
i
had
the
pleasure
of
doing
that
once
playing
with
the
speedo
cable
and
with
my
bd
heavy
duty
at
full
speed
rpm
all
the
speedo
ever
got
up
to
was
mph
now
if
you
go
a
high
speed
drill
and
ran
it
at
say
rpm
you
could
get
mph
out
of
it
if
you
speedo
doesnt
burn
out
anyways
to
roll
a
mile
odometer
would
take
days
or
so
much
easier
just
to
take
the
speedo
apart
thought
id
share
btw
all
this
info
was
obtained
legally
o
