i
dont
know
why
my
fpu
has
an
xc
my
original
mhz
fpu
was
label
mc
but
it
seems
to
work
fine
on
my
system
ps
or
does
it
mean
experimental
chip
instead
of
motorola
chip
the
rule
for
the
designations
is
that
if
it
says
mc
that
means
it
works
exactly
the
way
the
datasheetbook
specifies
if
it
says
xc
that
means
there
is
at
least
one
known
bug
often
these
bugs
are
small
and
obscure
you
might
never
run
into
them
in
practice
at
least
motorola
admits
it
unlike
certain
other
companies
all
work
is
one
mans
work
