thats
scary
if
theres
a
way
to
set
an
arbitrary
mileage
figure
into
the
odometer
you
cant
trust
any
odometer
reading
even
if
you
can
prove
that
the
odometer
itself
is
the
same
one
that
came
on
the
car
originally
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
can
shed
any
light
on
just
how
it
is
that
these
electronic
odometers
remember
the
total
elapsed
mileage
what
kind
of
memory
is
stablereliable
enough
nonvolatile
enough
and
independent
enough
of
outside
battery
power
to
last
say
years
or
more
in
the
life
of
a
vehicle
im
amazed
that
anything
like
this
could
be
expected
to
work
for
this
length
of
time
especially
in
light
of
all
the
gizmos
i
work
with
that
are
doing
good
to
work
for
months
without
breaking
down
somehow
side
question
how
about
the
legal
ramifications
of
selling
a
used
car
with
a
replaced
odometer
that
starts
over
at
miles
after
say
k
actual
miles
looks
like
fraud
would
be
fairly
easy
for
the
price
of
a
new
odometer
you
can
say
it
has
however
many
miles
you
want
to
tell
the
buyer
it
has
thanks
for
any
insight
