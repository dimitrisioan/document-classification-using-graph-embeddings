if
you
know
much
about
pcs
ibm
comp
you
might
try
the
joystick
port
though
i
havent
tried
this
myself
ive
been
told
that
the
port
has
built
in
ad
converters
this
would
allow
the
joystick
to
be
a
couple
of
pots
if
you
could
find
the
specs
this
might
just
work
for
you
i
guess
k
connecting
pins
x
y
x
and
y
or
get
an
bit
daconverter
merely
a
couple
of
transistors
and
resistors
and
an
opamp
to
compare
its
output
to
the
voltage
you
want
to
measure
connect
them
to
a
spared
printer
port
if
you
have
one
and
do
the
rest
by
software
stepwise
refinement
the
port
addresses
for
your
printer
ports
are
probably
h
lpt
h
lpt
this
should
work
well
enough
for
your
purposes
hope
this
helps
