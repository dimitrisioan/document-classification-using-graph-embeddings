an
nowdeceased
prof
told
us
willing
students
about
a
project
he
had
worked
on
during
wwii
they
needed
a
megapower
pa
with
very
clear
audio
quality
the
purpose
was
to
bellow
at
refugees
from
aircraft
their
solution
was
a
giant
compressedair
source
and
a
horn
with
parallel
shutters
worked
by
a
small
audio
system
i
think
he
said
it
worked
very
well
thus
the
war
dept
cancelled
the
project
gee
i
got
the
idea
from
somewhere
that
devices
like
this
were
in
common
use
in
wwii
so
that
commanders
on
board
ships
could
bellow
at
the
troops
landing
on
a
beach
for
example
which
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
from
the
mids
at
a
communications
conference
a
marine
corps
communications
officer
said
he
didnt
care
much
for
all
the
spreadspectrum
multiaccess
expensive
communication
systems
that
people
were
talking
about
at
the
time
what
he
wanted
was
a
kilowatt
broadcast
transmitter
on
the
ship
and
a
japanese
transistor
radio
stuck
in
the
ear
of
every
marine
hitting
the
beach
ya
can
talk
all
ya
wan
na
but
its
difrent
than
it
was
no
it
aint
but
ya
got
ta
know
