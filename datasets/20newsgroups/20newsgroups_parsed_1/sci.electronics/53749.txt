re
need
to
find
out
number
to
a
phone
line
well
this
is
my
second
try
at
posting
on
this
subject
here
goes
in
texas
corpus
christi
at
least
if
you
pick
up
the
phone
and
dial
the
phone
company
will
read
the
number
of
the
phone
you
are
on
back
to
you
i
believe
the
service
department
uses
this
to
make
certain
they
are
repairing
the
correct
lines
when
they
open
the
big
junction
boxes
i
dont
know
if
it
will
work
but
you
can
give
it
a
try
good
luck
