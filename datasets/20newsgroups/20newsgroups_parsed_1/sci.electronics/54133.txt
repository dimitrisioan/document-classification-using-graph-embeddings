the
story

all
stuck

the
regular

red
and
off
yelloworange
leds
what
gives
anybody
have
a
scoop
on
fairly
low
priced
blue
leds
in
order
to
emit
blue
light
a
semiconductor
must
have
a
band
gap
energy
within
the
region
of
to
electron
volts
according
to
my
physical
electronics
prof
you
cant
get
an
led
with
that
band
gap
thats
why
you
dont
find
blue
leds
or
for
that
matter
some
other
colour
of
leds
that
is
not
to
say
that
blue
leds
cant
be
found
ive
seen
blue
leds
sold
but
they
were
just
your
typical
visible
light
led
in
a
blue
plastic
covering
they
didnt
emit
very
much
light
source
solid
