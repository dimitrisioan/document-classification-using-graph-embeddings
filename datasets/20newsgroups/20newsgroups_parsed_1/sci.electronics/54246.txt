can
anyone
offer
a
suggestion
on
a
problem
i
am
having
i
have
several
boards
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
decode
dtmf
tones
and
send
the
resultant
in
ascii
to
a
pc
these
boards
run
on
the
serial
interface
i
need
to
run
of
the
boards
somwehat
simultaneously
i
need
to
be
able
to
ho
ok
them
up
to
a
pc
the
problem
is
how
do
i
hook
up
serial
devices
to
one
pc
inexpensivley
so
that
all
can
send
data
simulataneously
or
close
to
it
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
abhin
singla
if
you
can
modify
the
design
of
the
dtmf
decoder
the
ideal
comunications
would
be
over
a
multidrop
system
like
rs
rs
boards
are
available
for
pcs
probably
cheaper
than
a
bunch
of
rs
channels
and
rs
is
cheaper
to
build
onto
your
satellite
modules
using
only
a
single
supply
pin
dip
driver
chip
software
at
the
pc
end
would
be
similarly
complex
for
either
rs
or
rs
in
my
opinion
the
higher
data
rates
possible
with
rs
would
permit
quasisimultaneous
data
transmission
hope
this
helps
