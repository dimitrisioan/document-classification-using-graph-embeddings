this
is
vague
so
i
am
posting
it
in
case
anyone
else
knows
more
i
recall
reading
of
a
phonograph
which
used
mechanical
amplification
compressed
air
was
squirted
out
of
a
valve
which
was
controlled
by
the
pickup
the
result
was
noisy
and
distinctly
lofi
but
much
louder
than
a
conventional
phonograph
it
tended
to
wear
the
disks
out
pretty
quickly
though
