if
you
are
going
to
use
one
where
it
counts
egaviation
space
scuttle
etc
then
i
suggest
you
go
and
buy
a
fluke
never
seen
a
beckman
however
for
every
other
use
you
can
buy
a
cheapie
i
have
a
metex
which
is
some
made
up
name
as
i
have
seen
the
same
dmm
with
other
brand
names
on
it
i
bought
it
about
yrs
ago
for
aus
convert
that
to
us
and
you
see
that
its
definetly
a
cheapie
so
far
it
has
proved
to
be
accurate
taken
moderate
abuse
and
has
many
features
on
it
cap
freqtransistor
check
etc
i
am
very
happy
with
it
and
would
definetly
not
buy
a
fluke
just
for
the
name
hope
this
helps
cheers
