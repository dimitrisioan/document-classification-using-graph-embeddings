in
order
to
emit
blue
light
a
semiconductor
must
have
a
band
gap
energy
within
the
region
of
to
electron
volts
according
to
my
physical
electronics
prof
you
cant
get
an
led
with
that
band
gap
thats
why
you
dont
find
blue
leds
or
for
that
matter
some
other
colour
of
leds
that
is
not
to
say
that
blue
leds
cant
be
found
ive
seen
blue
leds
sold
but
they
were
just
your
typical
visible
light
led
in
a
blue
plastic
covering
they
didnt
emit
very
much
light
um
your
professor
if
just
plain
wrong
although
blue
leds
are
one
heck
of
a
lot
less
efficient
than
red
ones
typical
visible
light
leds
dont
really
exist
leds
have
a
fairly
narrow
region
of
transmittence
since
the
fermi
energy
around
either
side
of
the
band
gap
falls
off
exponentially

you
might
want
to
check
the
copyright
date
on
that
blue
leds
most
certainly
do
exist
ive
got
a
bunch
at
work
cree
research
makes
them
probably
along
with
other
companies
cree
is
big
in
materials
science
though
they
advertise
in
the
stuff
like
physics
today
etc
you
can
buy
them
from
jameco
i
think
digikey
definitely
and
plenty
of
other
distributors
actually
these
days
you
can
get
a
typical
visible
light
led
its
called
a
rainbow
led
and
ive
forgotten
who
makes
it
they
advertise
in
edn
and
many
of
the
other
trade
rags
though
it
combines
a
reg
green
and
blue
led
all
on
one
chip
and
has
four
leads
nifty
device
although
its
probably
fairly
expensive
