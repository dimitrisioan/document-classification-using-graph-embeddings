hello
again
i
asked
this
a
year
ago
but
i
am
still
looking
i
am
getting
sick
of
having
to
use
a
hc
if
you
are
just
getting
sick
of
the
real
estate
used
by
the
hct
you
could
always
use
the
approach
i
have
seen
one
designer
take
he
stuck
the
chip
in
the
middle
of
the
eprom
socket
under
the
eprom
naturally
you
have
to
use
an
ic
socket
with
the
right
dimensions
but
layout
is
really
easy
