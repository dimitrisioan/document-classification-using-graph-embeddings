re
adc
card
for
computer
in
article
you
say
i
would
like
to
digitize
the
output
of
a
squid
magnetometer
range
v
to
v
and
do
digital
signal
processing
in
a
computer
say
a
macintosh
ii
or
a
pc
i
would
like
a
good
bit
adc
with
good
linearity
and
a
high
conversion
speed
at
least
khz
preferably
khz
other
concerns
must
i
use
an
adc
external
to
my
computer
to
avoid
digital
noise
feedback
into
my
sensitive
squid
electronics
might
be
a
good
idea
the
resolution
you
requested
is
about
mv
in
order
to
get
what
youve
paid
for
noise
level
better
be
lower
than
that
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
do
it
in
a
noisy
box
like
you
can
expect
inside
a
pc
before
you
pay
for
a
pc
card
test
it
out
by
sampling
a
low
distortion
sine
wave
i
think
there
is
a
sine
wave
on
a
cd
digital
domain
there
are
possibly
other
low
thd
sources
run
the
digitized
waveform
through
a
fft
transform
and
take
alook
at
the
noise
floor
on
the
spectrum
thats
should
give
you
a
good
indication
of
the
design
thats
what
i
am
doing
to
test
a
data
acquistion
system
i
have
designed
i
got
the
idea
from
maxim
data
sheet
if
you
can
live
with
bit
resolution
i
would
recommend
looking
at
the
max
from
maxim
it
is
a
high
speed
khz
complete
sampling
ad
with
dsp
interface
the
input
range
is
v
and
it
uses
a
serial
interface
which
can
easily
be
optically
isolated
from
the
computer
to
elinimate
a
major
noise
source
the
analog
design
guide
i
got
from
them
shows
a
db
noise
level
they
claim
a
db
max
typ
thd
looks
pretty
good
for
the
pieces
a
evaluation
kit
is
available
might
want
to
give
these
nice
folks
a
call
or
fax
and
ext
for
application
assistance
this
assumes
that
you
can
build
your
own
das
and
write
your
own
software
hey
you
can
get
the
max
as
a
free
sample
just
by
calling
the
i
would
appreciate
discussion
of
your
personal
experience
with
a
mac
or
pc
based
adc
system
i
would
recommend
you
to
find
out
the
resolution
that
can
be
gotten
out
of
your
system
by
looking
at
the
noise
level
otherwise
you
might
be
throwing
out
your
money

i
have
no
connection
with
maxim
except
i
do
in
general
recommend
companies
that
give
samples
to
students
to
others
i
feel
they
deserve
that
for
being
nice
to
me
