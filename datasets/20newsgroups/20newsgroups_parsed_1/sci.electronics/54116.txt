why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
i
decided
to
bring
the
battery
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycle
from
the
unheated
garage
this
year
to
preserve
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
noticed
that
not
only
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
terminals
are
shorted
i
asked
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
cause
it
ruins
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
why
this
topic
was
beaten
to
death
a
year
or
so
ago
the
concrete
is
not
the
problem
leadacid
batteries
often
fail
from
disuse
not
being
charged
for
a
long
time
but
theres
no
way
the
concrete
floor
could
be
the
cause
of
the
problem
the
concrete
floor
accelerates
the
problem
because
it
is
a
heat
sink
and
a
colder
leadacid
battery
selfdischarges
at
a
slightly
faster
rate
thats
why
the
old
wives
tale
of
sitting
it
on
a
piece
of
wood
on
the
floor
works
to
help
keep
from
killing
the
battery
as
fast
it
insulates
the
battery
thermally
it
youll
set
the
battery
down
on
a
piece
of
styrofoam
it
will
selfdischarge
even
slower
the
best
thing
would
be
to
attach
a
small
load
such
as
a
small
transistor
radio
with
the
volume
turned
down
low
and
leave
it
on
constantly
but
also
tricklecharge
it
every
couple
days
too
to
shallow
cycle
the
charge
in
the
battery
such
mild
exercising
of
a
leadacid
battery
is
the
next
best
thing
to
completely
removing
the
electrolyte
for
storage
if
you
do
remove
the
electrolyte
may
sure
you
keep
separate
storage
containers
for
each
cells
electrolyte
and
put
it
back
into
the
same
cells
when
you
refill
the
battery
this
isnt
so
critical
for
a
brandnew
battery
in
a
fully
charged
state
but
will
maximize
the
restored
output
of
an
older
battery
which
may
not
be
fully
charged
when
you
remove
the
electrolyte
for
storage
