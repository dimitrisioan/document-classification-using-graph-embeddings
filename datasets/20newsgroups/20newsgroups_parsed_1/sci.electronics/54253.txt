nothing
but
if
you
read
my
whole
suggestion
im
saying
that
you
register
via
mail
by
mailing
in
your
registration
card
then
the
company
send
you
the
patch
which
includes
the
info
you
put
on
the
registration
card
the
problem
with
this
scheme
is
that
when
i
buy
a
game
i
want
to
play
it
that
daymailing
a
card
to
and
from
california
would
probably
take
a
week
or
more
i
didnt
say
the
program
is
disabled
did
i
i
hate
it
when
people
take
my
words
out
of
context
i
mean
that
once
you
have
installed
it
you
can
not
deinstall
it
without
registering
it
or
transfer
it
to
another
machine
or
some
sort
of
limitation
the
author
will
decide
which
will
be
removed
when
the
program
is
registered
