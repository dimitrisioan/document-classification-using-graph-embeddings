backupable
if
restored
to
the
same
machine
depends
on
the
programmer
dont
use
a
disk
drive
characteristic
if
the
user
did
an
upgrade
to
the
machine
heshe
should
reinstall
all
programs
any
way
no
document
lookup
no
disk
wearandtear
this
is
not
a
good
idea
i
upgraded
my
motherboard
last
fall
i
would
have
been
quite
pissed
at
any
software
that
would
have
forced
me
to
reinstall
simply
because
i
changed
motherboards
opinion
is
understandable
i
assume
you
have
a
tape
drive
not
all
of
us
have
about
floppies
around
for
backup
you
know
any
info
in
the
bios
is
too
volatile
to
use
as
a
checksum
are
you
going
to
require
that
a
user
reinstall
all
their
software
if
they
add
mb
of
ram
to
their
computer
i
did
that
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
its
in
the
bios
and
if
software
had
told
me
this
isnt
the
machine
you
installed
me
on
i
would
never
have
used
that
software
again
really
bad
idea
ram
is
something
you
add
all
the
time
so
no
its
more
like
bios
manufacturer
andor
processor
type
etc
data
can
not
be
used
esp
with
these
new
flash
rom
bios
machines
with
updates
on
a
diskette
on
the
other
hand
to
make
this
less
intrusive
it
could
be
disguised
as
please
insert
original
disk
xx
as
i
need
file
yyyyyy
for
update
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
sort
of
i
did
not
say
that
the
originals
would
allow
only
one
install
the
users
conscience
should
do
that
this
is
silly
its
much
easier
to
loan
disks
to
a
friend
and
let
them
do
an
install
than
to
backup
your
copy
already
on
disk
and
then
give
them
that
your
scheme
isnt
going
to
stop
anyone
of
course
it
is
easier
are
you
saying
then
the
originals
should
allow
only
one
install
what
is
your
point
you
know
how
many
bytes
you
need
to
change
in
xwing
to
disable
the
quiz
two
yes
two
and
dont
ask
me
which
ones
they
are
do
you
know
any
assembly
language
at
all
all
anyone
needs
to
do
if
find
the
part
of
the
code
that
does
the
quiz
and
insert
a
jmp
instruction
to
just
completely
skip
it
not
that
difficult
really
and
there
is
very
little
that
commpanies
can
do
to
stop
this
type
of
thing
using
pklite
or
some
similar
utility
would
help
but
only
if
the
resulting
compressed
exe
were
tagged
as
uncompressable
i
know
x
and
x
assembly
quite
well
thank
you
i
know
exactly
which
two
bytes
need
to
be
changed
i
have
the
code
to
do
them
too
i
just
said
dont
ask
me
which
ones
i
didnt
say
i
dont
know
what
that
means
such
hacking
can
be
easily
discouraged
by
adding
antipatching
code
which
does
a
selfcheck
upon
execution
and
refuse
to
load
if
crc
does
not
match
value
stored
encrypted
of
course
in
the
program
it
could
be
claimed
as
a
part
of
antivirus
code
and
it
would
not
be
far
from
the
truth
what
i
believe
the
companies
should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a
special
patch
once
the
user
registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon
bootup
registered
to
xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
this
is
by
far
the
best
idea
you
presented
in
your
post
making
it
plainly
obvious
who
registered
is
going
to
stop
casual
pirates
but
the
determined
ones
are
just
going
to
answer
joe
blow
to
the
question
of
whats
your
name
so
this
wont
stop
them
in
the
long
run
did
anyone
read
what
i
wrote
that
is
not
what
i
wrote
or
meant
what
i
said
was
the
program
should
have
certain
restriction
such
as
the
restricttoonemachine
until
the
program
is
registered
with
the
manufacturer
the
manufacturer
will
then
supply
the
thenprovenlegitimateuser
with
a
patch
that
will
disable
the
restriction
and
proudly
proclaim
the
legal
copy
with
the
registered
to
xxx
screen
pirates
are
always
going
to
win
this
fight
they
simply
have
more
time
to
work
on
the
software
and
figure
out
the
protection
scheme
of
course
they
will
but
that
was
not
my
point
the
purpose
of
copy
protection
is
to
discourage
casual
pirates
oh
can
i
have
a
copy
of
thatsure
here
and
the
less
sophisticated
pirates
lets
look
for
all
those
calls
to
inth
any
one
determined
enough
to
break
copy
protection
can
and
will
succeed
they
can
always
backtrace
the
entire
loadsequence
of
the
program
the
point
of
copy
protection
is
to
make
such
attempts
take
as
long
as
possible
while
not
intruding
upon
the
uses
or
to
minimize
such
intrusion
of
legitimate
use
pirates
who
see
copy
protection
as
a
challenge
love
breaking
them
and
no
amount
of
copy
protection
will
stop
them
but
the
rest
of
us
will
be
stopped
how
many
of
these
hardcore
pirates
are
there
compared
to
rest
of
us
not
that
many
kasey
chang
