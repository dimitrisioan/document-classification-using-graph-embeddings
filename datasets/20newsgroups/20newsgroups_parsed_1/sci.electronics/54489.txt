im
trying
to
build
a
mixer
for
a
friend
of
mine
to
run
several
things
into
a
single
boom
box
i
have
a
circuit
that
uses
an
opamp
powered
by
either
a
couple
of
v
batteries
or
using
some
kind
of
power
supply
but
in
a
catalog
i
was
looking
at
recently
a
passive
mixer
for
guitar
was
advertised
taht
doesnt
appear
to
use
any
power
at
all
does
anyone
know
what
the
circuit
for
this
would
be
because
then
i
could
just
adapt
it
for
rca
jacks
and
save
my
friend
and
i
alot
of
messing
with
batteries
and
plugs
thanks
well
the
fastest
crudest
mixer
aside
from
just
physically
connecting
all
your
inputs
together
directly
is
to
run
each
signal
through
a
resistor
to
a
common
output
the
resistors
give
some
isolation
so
the
signal
sources
arent
driving
directly
into
each
other
taking
a
wild
seatofthepants
guess
id
say
that
if
you
are
mixing
highimpedance
sources
like
some
dynamic
mikes
electric
guitar
pickups
etc
your
resistors
ought
to
be
maybe
k
k
or
so
if
you
are
mixing
linelevel
stuff
or
the
outputs
of
a
walkman
or
such
id
go
with
k
input
output
