why
does
everyone
think
they
need
to
be
able
to
make
a
backup
copy
almost
all
new
software
must
be
installed
to
the
hard
disk
so
you
are
left
with
the
originals
as
your
backups
i
think
its
a
waste
of
time
space
and
money
as
well
as
it
makes
it
to
tempting
to
lend
out
the
backups
my
own
practice
with
new
software
make
a
copy
of
the
original
floppies
to
a
second
set
of
floppies
install
to
hard
drive
from
second
set
of
floppies
put
originals
in
a
box
in
room
number
one
put
copies
in
box

number
two
accidents
do
happen
to
original
floppies
accidents
can
happen
to
the
installation
floppy
sometimes
software
goes
out
on
floppies
that
are
just
marginally
good
or
gets
too
close
to
a
magnet
in
shipping
or
storage
ive
had
experience
with
something
like
the
last
i
purchased
a
compiler
from
a
reputable
vendor
the
debugger
in
the
package
just
would
not
install
to
the
hard
drive
no
way
repeated
floppytofloppy
copies
finally
got
a
clean
read
of
the
disk
i
dont
recall
if
i
used
diskcopy
copyb
or
xcopy
i
made
a
second
copy
of
the
marginal
floppy
and
installed
from
that
no
problenms
except
with
my
typing
since
i
regard
backup
floppies
as
cheap
insurance
just
my
side
of
the
question
