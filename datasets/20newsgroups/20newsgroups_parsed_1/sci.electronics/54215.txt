hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
ham
rigs
not
possible
either
youd
need
about
a
amp
alternator
for
just
the
amplifier
i
can
just
see
it
you
need
to
slow
down
on
a
downgrade
so
you
hit
the
push
to
talk
button
well
amps
anyway
transmissions
are
generally
for
a
short
interval
the
battery
would
supply
the
rest
of
course
if
you
transmitted
too
much
you
would
run
the
battery
down
it
really
would
not
be
that
much
of
a
brake
even
at
efficiency
watts
would
only
consume
horsepower
bill
