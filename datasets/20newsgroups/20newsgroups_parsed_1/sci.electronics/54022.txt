you
should
be
clear
in
your
mind
what
your
goal
is
two
possible
goals
are
maximizing
you
income
from
your
program
and
minimizing
the
number
of
illegal
copies
which
get
created
accomplishing
doesnt
usually
accomplish
most
vendors
have
concluded
that
copy
protection
reduces
the
number
of
normal
legitimate
sales
by
far
more
than
it
increase
sales
by
virtue
of
changing
copiers
to
purchasers
and
hence
merely
reduces
revenue
most
legitimate
buyers
nowadays
including
me
have
had
bad
experiences
with
copy
protected
products
eg
hard
to
make
a
legitimate
backup
incompatabilties
when
new
system
on
system
upgrade
etc
and
they
wont
