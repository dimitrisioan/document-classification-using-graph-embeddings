i
had
a
catalog
with
membrane
keypads
but
i
dunno
what
happened
to
it
and
it
was
so
long
ago
that
i
forget
the
name
of
the
company
anyway
you
could
make
your
own
legend
and
slip
it
behind
the
bezel
really
nice
and
reasonably
priced
can
anyone
tell
me
where
to
get
some
more
of
these
critters
for
some
reason
the
name
grayhill
springs
to
mind
saw
something
like
that
in
a
grayhill
catalog
along
with
options
for
custom
printed
overlays
and
a
neat
little
electroluuminescent
backing
that
would
make
the
whole
shebang
glow
a
nice
shade
of
green
mighty
handy
if
youre
trying
to
key
a
door
combination
in
the
dark
and
dont
want
to
turn
on
the
light
bgb
the
only
reason
the
world
hasnt
really
bruce
bostwick
dissolved
into
total
chaos
is
that
from
the
great
state
of
texas
murphys
law
also
applies
to
murphy
