re
help
with
ultralong
timing
thanks
for
the
resposes
as
they
were
all
good
ideas
and
i
am
looking
at
using
a
couple
of
the
ideas
i
recieved
in
the
mail
today
the
spec
sheets
on
the
mil
spec
version
of
exars
xr
timercounter
chip
it
is
stable
down
to
c
and
sucks
very
little
power
they
show
an
application
for
a
ultralong
time
delay
up
to
several
years
depending
on
the
rc
time
constant
in
this
application
they
have
two
of
them
cascaded
together
the
reset
and
trigger
pins
of
both
chips
are
tied
together
and
the
timebase
of
the
second
chip
is
disabled
in
this
configuration
the
output
is
high
when
the
system
is
reset
when
triggered
the
output
goes
low
and
stays
that
way
for
a
total
of
x
the
timing
cycle
of
the
first
chip
the
total
timing
cycle
of
the
two
chips
can
be
programmed
from
to
x
r
x
c
to
x
r
x
c
in
steps
by
selecting
any
combination
of
the
counter
outputs
to
the
timer
output
the
beauty
of
it
is
the
timebase
chip
would
only
have
to
have
a
uf
timing
cap
and
a
k
resistor
for
seconds
per
timing
cycle
so
i
can
get
a
maximum
of
seconds
between
timing
cycles
x
or
about
days
of
course
thats
much
more
than
i
need
days
but
the
counter
allows
for
binary
steps
that
can
be
selected
for
the
output
for
the
pellet
puker
after
the
first
days
and
it
trips
it
would
reset
its
self
for
the
next
day
timing
cycle
and
so
forth
power
is
still
a
problem
though
a
few
ideas
that
you
suggested
was
to
bury
the
electronics
in
a
hole
dug
in
the
snow
as
an
insulator
and
put
the
pellet
puker
up
on
a
tower
above
the
estimated
snow
fall
with
a
solar
panel
on
it
to
keep
a
charge
on
a
lithium
battery
pack
i
like
that
idea
this
thing
has
to
work
for
at
least
six
weeks
for
three
samples
and
the
gas
valves
are
volts
to
spit
the
pellets
out
onto
the
snow
anyway
i
ordered
the
xrs
to
see
what
i
can
do
with
them
should
be
interesting
as
long
as
im
not
the
one
that
has
to
go
digging
up
the
pellets
in
the
middle
of
antartica
freezing
my
buns
off
thanks
again
everyone
wes
