module
down
stream
from
the
volt
supply
several
sets
ive
looked
at
use
a
volt
regulator
the
regulators
have
a
tendency
to
short
out
making
the
safety
circuits
shut
down
the

supply
section
try
putting
the
set
on
a
variac
or
adjustable
transformer
and
lower
the
ac
input
voltage
to
the
set
to
about
volts
if
the
set
operates
nromally
then
you
know
youve
got
a
shorted
regulator
there
are
myriad
other
areas
for
problems
