re
scope
questions
if
my
life
depended
on
it
id
say
that
its
a
scope
that
uses
longpersistance
phosphor
to
keep
the
successive
taces
on
the
screen
for
some
unit
of
time
store
them
do
i
get
to
live
well
let
you
live
but
just
this
once
theres
more
to
a
real
storage
scope
than
just
a
longpersistence
phosphor
actually
the
phosphor
isnt
usually
anything
special
at
all
what
makes
a
storage
tube
work
is
a
screen
placed
just
behind
the
phosphor
which
becomes
charged
as
the
electron
beam
intially
writes
the
trace
with
the
trace
now
written
to
the
screen
a
separate
lowlevel
flood
electron
gun
keeps
the
image
lit
by
exciting
those
areas
of
phosphor
which
are
next
to
the
written
areas
on
the
storage
screen
there
are
some
problems
with
this
the
resolution
is
limited
compared
to
a
nonstorage
tube
and
the
stored
trace
tends
to
bloom
with
time
of
course
this
is
pretty
much
obsolete
technology
done
in
by
the
current
digital
scopes
which
use
rasterscan
displays
and
keep
everything
in
a
framebuffer
memory
anyways
