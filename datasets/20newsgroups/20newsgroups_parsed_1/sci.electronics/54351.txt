does
anyone
know
of
any
type
of
acceleration
sensor
that
has
an
electrical
output
of
any
sort
it
would
only
have
to
sense
acceleration
in
one
direction

accelerometers
are
not
cheap
mainly
because
the
outputs
are
fairly
linear
with
respect
to
acceleration
you
dont
say
what
the
range
of
acceleration
you
want
to
measure
is
and
there
are
other
ways
in
which
to
measure
it
other
than
using
an
accelerometer
additional
information
would
be
helpful
to
anyone
who
may
respond
call
if
you
wish
