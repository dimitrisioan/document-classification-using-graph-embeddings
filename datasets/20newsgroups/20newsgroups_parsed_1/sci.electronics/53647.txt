motorola
xcrc
and
rc
i
just
installed
a
motorola
xcrc
fpu
in
an
amiga
a
board
mhz
with
capability
to
clock
the
fpu
separately
previously
a
mcrc
was
installed
and
everything
was
working
perfectly
now
the
systems
displays
a
yellow
screen
indicating
a
exception
when
it
check
for
the
presencetype
of
fpu
when
i
reinstall
an
mcrc
the
system
works
fine
but
with
the
xc
even
at
mhz
it
does
not
work
the
designer
of
the
board
mentioned
that
putting
a
pullup
resistor
on
datastrobe
ohm
might
help
but
that
didnt
change
anything
does
anybody
have
some
suggestions
what
i
could
do
does
this
look
like
a
cpufpu
communications
problem
or
is
the
particular
chip
dead
it
is
a
pull
not
new
moreover
the
place
i
bought
it
from
is
sending
me
an
xcrc
i
thought
that
the
rc
were
labeled
mc
not
xc
for
not
finalized
mask
design
are
there
any
mcrc
thanks
christian
