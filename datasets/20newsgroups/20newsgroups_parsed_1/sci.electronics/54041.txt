there
is
or
was
a
microwave
tower
next
to
floridas
turnpike
and
you
could
watch
the
cars
hit
the
breaks
as
they
came
in
sight
of
it
every
morning
funny
i
and
most
of
the
detectorowning
friends
i
have
are
generally
able
to
remember
such
things
as
nearby
microwave
towers
and
radar
detectors
going
off
in
exactly
the
same
spon
every
day
i
know
on
i
at
the
grayson
ky
exit
theres
a
store
just
off
the
side
of
the
road
think
its
a
liquor
store
with
what
must
be
a
security
system
that
would
make
most
federal
prisons
proud
its
the
only
thing
ive
ever
driven
by
besides
a
cop
that
puts
my
whistler
in
oh
my
god
hes
right
behind
you
mode
i
simply
ignore
the
detector
and
use
my
eyes
when
i
drive
by
that
store
seconds
later
alls
quiet
on
the
front
and
no
problem
