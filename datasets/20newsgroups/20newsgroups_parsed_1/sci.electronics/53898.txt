re
how
to
the
disks
copy
protected
write
a
good
manual
to
go
with
the
software
the
hassle
of
photocopying
the
manual
is
offset
by
simplicity
of
purchasing
the
package
for
only
also
consider
offering
an
inexpensive
but
attractive
perc
for
registered
users
for
instance
a
coffee
mug
you
could
produce
and
mail
the
incentive
for
a
couple
of
dollars
so
consider
pricing
the
product
at
youre
lucky
if
only
of
the
instances
of
your
program
in
use
are
nonlicensed
users
the
best
approach
is
to
estimate
your
loss
and
accomodate
that
into
your
price
structure
sure
it
hurts
legitimate
users
but
too
bad
retailers
have
to
charge
off
loss
to
shoplifters
onto
paying
customers
the
software
industry
is
the
same
unless
your
product
is
exceptionally
unique
using
an
ostensibly
copyproof
disk
will
just
send
your
customers
to
the
competetion
bill
