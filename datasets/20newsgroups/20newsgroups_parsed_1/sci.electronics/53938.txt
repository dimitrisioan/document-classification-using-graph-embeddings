i
would
like
to
be
able
to
detect
the
angular
position
low
accuracy
of
an
ir
emitting
source
at
a
distance
of
about
meters
more
is
better
in
daylight
the
ir
source
could
be
emitting
a
signature
im
leaning
toward
khz
square
wave
with
duty
cycle
i
am
considering
the
use
of
a
quadrant
detector
from
centronic
inc
to
give
information
to
a
pantilt
head
to
point
the
sensor
and
thus
determine
the
angles
for
the
source
i
am
considering
wazing
the
heck
out
of
an
ir
leds
possibly
an
optek
op
or
motorola
mled
wazing
would
mean
at
least
amp
current
pulses
at
this
current
the
duty
cycle
of
the
led
drops
to
and
i
would
need
to
cycle
five
of
them
in
turn
to
get
the
required
has
anyone
done
something
like
this
yeesh
you
will
be
nailing
those
irleds
may
i
suggest
getting
your
mitts
on
the
siemens
sfh
irled
this
unit
is
designed
to
take
some
big
current
pulses
if
you
can
get
your
duty
cycle
down
a
bit
it
will
output
nearly
a
watt
mw
with
real
short
duty
cycle
times
nice
thing
about
the
sfh
is
that
it
is
cheap
i
got
mine
for
about
cents
a
piece
even
though
i
had
to
buy
of
them
btw
i
have
seen
irleds
with
outputs
up
to
wattshonest
watts
i
dont
have
the
book
here
at
work
so
i
cant
recall
the
company
name
the
watter
aint
cheap
around
but
if
you
want
some
power
mamamia
thats
pretty
hot
they
also
have
a
watt
a
watt
and
a
watt
device
in
their
line
and
will
sell
small
quan
to
individuals
if
you
are
interested
i
can
find
the
book
at
home
and
get
the
pertinent
info
now
as
for
the
position
detector
you
might
try
eltec
in
florida
phone
number
listed
in
the
etid
is
they
seem
like
nice
people
their
specialty
is
passive
infrared
detection
devices
so
they
might
be
able
to
help
you
out
im
curious
about
your
applications
if
you
dont
mind
saying
the
device
sounds
like
it
could
be
useful
in
a
lasertag
game
although
youd
need
to
up
your
carrier
signal
concept
to
khz
duane
