my
yr
old
son
has
signed
up
to
do
a
science
report
on
batteries
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
provide
me
with
some
information
as
to
how
to
construct
a
homebuilt
battery
in
my
grade
school
days
i
remember
seeing
the
ice
cube
tray
version
but
i
dont
remember
what
to
use
as
a
good
electrolyte
or
what
the
easily
obtainable
metals
were
thank
you
in
advance
i
remember
watching
a
whole
mr
wizzard
program
on
this
subject
when
i
was
a
kid
the
battery
constructed
on
the
program
which
made
the
biggest
impression
on
me
and
generated
the
most
power
was
made
using
a
galvanized
bucket
for
the
zinc
and
a
copper
toilet
tank
float
the
electrolyte
was
