these
days
and

the
hc
is
an
eprom
version
of
the
hc
raw
hc
parts
have
factory
set
rom
images
and
as
such
are
useless
to
the
hobbyist
hc
parts
have
eeprom
allowing
for
electrical
erasure
and
reprogramming
some
motorola
parts
such
as
the
hck
have
eprom
making
them
user
programmable
but
come
with
options
of
either
windowed
or
sealed
the
more
expensive
windowed
packages
allow
multiple
use
the
plastic
dip
varieties
are
onetime
programmable
since
there
is
no
way
of
exposing
the
eprom
array
