i
am
making
a
search
for
a
cad
program
that
does
a
decent
job
of
making
schematic
drawings
the
program
needs
to
be
in
msdos
windows
if
possible
what
i
want
the
cad
program
to
do
is
to
draw
diagrams
by
dragging
elements
onto
the
screen
and
in
this
the
elements
needed
are
as
diverse
as
vacuum
tubes
to
ics
case
with
pins
it
also
needs
to
have
provision
for
adding
legends
to
the
components
as
well
as
their
values
in
other
words
i
want
to
produce
quality
drawings
printout
would
be
to
either
pin
dotmatrix
andor
laser
printer
i
would
suggest
draw
for
windows
by
micrografx
i
have
this
on
my
home
box
its
quite
impressive
and
only
cost
ukl
it
has
a
rather
nice
clipart
library
facility
which
you
can
expand
with
your
own
drawings
there
is
no
circuit
component
clipart
included
but
you
could
add
your
own
quite
easily
it
works
with
any
windows
printer
driver
of
course
and
can
also
export
embedded
postscript
and
pcx
files
note
i
am
not
connected
with
micrografx
in
any
way

for
my
opinions
