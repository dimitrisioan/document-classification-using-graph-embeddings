anyone
know
of
any
good
suppliers
of
chips
one
that
could
have
almost
any
chip
i
need
i
dont
want
to
hunt
down
all
the
chips
i
may
need
so
it
would
be
greatly
appreciated
if
anyone
knows
of
a
good
distributor
thankyou
paul
unfortunately
there
are
not
too
many
retail
outlets
thatll
stock
just
about
every
chip
made
the
stuff
they
will
stock
are
the
ones
thatll
sell
like
standard
drams
s
s
etcetc
ie
i
cnat
think
of
any
onestopshopping
store
the
closest
you
can
get
is
to
pick
up
a
copy
of
byte
magazine
or
the
circuit
cellar
popular
electronics
and
the
like
and
flip
through
them
distributors
like
wyle
electronics
hamilton
avnet
pioneer
electronics
etc
etc
dont
normally
deal
with
endusers
like
ourselves
where
we
only
a
couple
of
everythingthey
only
deal
with
people
who
buy
by
the
hundreds
or
more
each
distributor
represents
and
sells
a
variety
of
different
noncompeting
manufacturers
what
do
i
mean
by
this
suppose
abc
electronics
sells
intel
s
its
a
pretty
good
bet
that
they
wont
be
selling
any
of
amds
s
or
viceversa
they
also
can
obtain
just
about
any
chip
you
want
from
a
manufacturer
they
represent
who
knows
you
might
be
lucky
to
be
able
to
buy
from
one
of
them
but
id
be
suprised
if
you
do
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
or
qty
prices
they
will
charge
you
will
be
much
greater
than
what
a
mail
order
outlet
will
charge
my
advice
if
youre
gon
na
be
designing
anything
try
to
stick
with
offtheshelf
stuff
youre
going
to
get
stuck
if
you
use
too
many
esoteric
parts
sooner
or
later
good
luck
