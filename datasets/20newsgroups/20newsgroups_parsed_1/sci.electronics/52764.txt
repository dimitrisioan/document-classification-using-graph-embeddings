please
dont
ask
questions
like
why
dont
you
buy
a
soundblaster
the
answer
is
simple
overpriced
considering
the
sound
quality
why
not
try
one
of
the
projects
to
build
a
dac
connected
to
the
parallel
port
as
documented
in
some
files
which
come
with
modplay
these
vary
from
a
dac
design
to
a
simple
single
dac
made
only
of
resistors
