the
same
thing
happens
to
my
car
citroen
cv
damp
gets
under
the
bonnet
us
hood
and
shorts
the
sparkplugs
to
earth
so
it
wont
start
the
solution
for
the
car
is
to
clean
the
plug
leads
and
spray
with
wd
moisture
repellant
if
damp
is
the
problem
then
storing
the
well
this
is
offtopic
but
back
in
the
days
when
i
used
to
drive
bangers
i
never
found
wd
to
do
anything
that
wiping
with
a
dry
cloth
didnt
do
i
think
the
effectiveness
of
wd
is
a
myth
invented
by
the
guy
who
owns
the
company
back
in
high
school
i
used
to
work
for
a
detailing
company
and
one
of
the
services
we
offered
was
an
engine
cleaning
remove
all
that
oil
before
you
sell
the
car
unfortunately
we
did
not
have
a
high
pressure
washer
so
we
would
use
one
several
miles
from
the
shop
on
more
than
one
occasion
after
washing
the
engine
it
would
not
start
as
water
would
have
gotten
under
the
distributor
i
would
put
a
plastic
bag
around
it
to
try
and
minimize
this
around
the
spark
plug
wires
etc
and
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
try
and
wipe
all
these
areas
down
with
a
dry
rag
the
usual
solution
was
to
carry
a
can
of
wd
and
when
the
car
wouldnt
start
to
spray
all
the
likely
areas
and
it
would
then
start
on
the
very
first
time
it
may
be
a
myth
but
it
certainly
kept
me
from
being
stranded
at
a
car
