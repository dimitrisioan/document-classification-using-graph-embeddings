re
making
up
odd
resistor
values
required
by
filters
in
scielectronics
ian
hawkins
writes
when
constructing
active
filters
odd
values
of
resistor
are
often
required
ie
something
like
a
k
ohm
resistorit
seems
best
to
choose
common
capacitor
values
and
cope
with
the
strange
resistances
then
demanded
is
there
a
pd
program
out
there
that
will
work
out
how
best
to
make
up
such
a
resistance
given
fixed
resistors
of
the
standard
values
per
decade
etc
it
is
a
common
enough
problem
yet
i
cant
recall
seing
a
program
that
tells
that
rxryrz
gives
rq
starting
with
q
and
finding
prefered
values
xy
and
z
since
youre
worrying
about
the
third
decimal
place
i
assume
youre
using
tolerance
resistors
and
capacitors
