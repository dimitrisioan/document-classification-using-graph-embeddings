hello
i
just
bought
a
new
portable
cd
player
for
the
office
and
i
notice
that
it
proudly
proclaims
times
oversampling
on
the
box
now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampling
is
the
rate
of
discrete
samples
exceeds
the
highest
frequency
component
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont
understand
this
times
business
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
was
it
really
years
ago
the
specs
said
times
could
someone
please
tell
me
whether
im
getting
senile
if
im
not
then
what
good
does
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
samples
at
a
higher
rate
if
i
really
wanted
better
fidelity
wouldnt
i
have
to
have
the
same
higher
rate
of
sampling
during
the
recording
process
furthermore
am
i
wrong
in
interpreting
the
sampling
rate
from
the
players
point
of
view
as
being
the
same
thing
as
the
data
rate
for
the
bit
stream
coming
off
the
optical
medium
does
this
mean
that
the
data
rate
related
to
the
rotational
speed
of
the
disk
has
changed
since
note
i
just
tried
to
figure
this
stuff
out
about
a
month
ago
myself
from
various
people
on
the
net
so
i
could
be
wrong
the
data
is
only
ever
read
once
barring
mistracks
and
such
of
course
and
eventually
gets
turned
into
khz
bit
two
channel
data
oversampling
takes
two
discrete
data
points
and
interpolates
n
points
between
them
for
n
times
oversampling
when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
anyway
then
the
purpose
of
oversampling
is
to
move
the
effective
sampling
rate
up
to
n
times
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequency
antialiasing
filters
for
the
same
quality
filter
higher
oversampling
lets
you
build
cheaper
filters
whereas
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversamplings
lets
you
build
better
filters
so
assuming
the
quality
of
all
other
components
in
a
cd
player
remained
the
same
oversampling
should
allow
a
manufacturer
to
produce
slightly
better
sound
due
to
antialias
filtering
