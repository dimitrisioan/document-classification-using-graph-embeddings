i
have
a
new
scope
and
i
thought
id
save
a
few
bucks
by
buying
one
with
a
function
generator
built
in
hmm
now
where
was
that
ad
for
the
combination
radiohand
cranked
generatorflashlightsiren
i
saw
function
generator
has
a
mv
offset
and
the
amplitudes
too
high
is
there
any
way
i
could
make
myself
a
little
box
that
could
solve
this
little
problem
the
box
would
tkae
the
function
generator
input
lower
the
voltage
and
give
an
output
impedance
that
is
some
low
unchanging
number
i
would
want
to
lower
the
voltage
by
a
factor
of
one
hundred
or
so
i
could
just
build
a
little
buffer
amp
but
id
like
to
have
this
box
not
be
active
sure
youve
already
got
the
right
idea
ignoring
the
ohm
internal
resistance
of
the
generator
for
a
second
just
run
it
into
say
a
voltage
divider
made
of
ohms
in
series
with
ohms
this
new
circuit
is
the
thevenin
equivalent
of
one
that
puts
out
of
the
original
voltage
and
has
an
output
impedence
of
negligibly
less
than
ohms
you
may
want
to
monkey
with
the
values
a
little
depending
on
whether
you
care
more
about
the
exact
dividing
ratio
or
the
availability
of
parts
hows
that
sound

kolstad
ps
this
is
why
those
high
voltage
probes
for
multimeters
can
be
accurate
but
still
cheap
they
have
something
like
megs
in
series
with
k
which
doesnt
load
the
often
high
impedence
source
much
as
well
as
keeping
the
probably
meg
impedance
multimeter
happy
