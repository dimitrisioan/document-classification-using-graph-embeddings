during
the
nuclear
fission
reaction
the
uranium
fuel
can
get
hot
enough
to
melt
when
this
happens
the
liquid
uranium
is
pumped
to
the
cooling
tower
where
it
is
sprayed
into
the
air
nonsense
first
the
uranium
fuel
is
sealed
in
zirconium
alloy
cylinders
which
dont
melt
in
any
circumstances
short
of
major
failure
of
the
power
plant
second
the
primary
water
that
circulates
inside
the
reactor
core
is
never
pumped
into
the
cooling
tower
its
the
secondary
water
cycle
that
goes
through
the
cooling
tower
third
liquid
uranium
would
burst
into
flame
on
contact
with
air
contact
with
the
cool
outside
air
will
condense
the
mist
and
it
will
fall
back
to
the
cooling
tower
floor
there
it
is
collected
by
a
cleaning
crew
using
shop
vacs
and
is
then
reformed
into
pellets
for
reactor
use
the
next
day
cleaning
crew
working
in
a
mist
of
uranium
this
is
a
toxic
heavy
metal
even
if
it
werent
radioactive
shouldnt
there
be
some
smileys
here
or
frowneys
