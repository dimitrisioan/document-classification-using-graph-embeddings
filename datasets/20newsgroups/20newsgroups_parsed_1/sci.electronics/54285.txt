what
are
peoples
opinions
about
laser
detectors
escort
makes
a
laser
detector
the
passport
and
claims
it
works
fine
however
ive
talked
to
some
people
who
have
said
that
it
will
only
work
if
you
are
lucky
ie
if
the
cop
happens
to
point
his
laser
at
a
car
in
front
of
you
and
the
laser
beam
happens
to
reflect
back
to
your
detector
otherwise
it
wont
work
regular
radar
of
course
travels
in
all
directions
hence
it
is
more
detectable
any
comments
escort
has
a
deal
till
the
end
of
april
i
think
where
if
you
buy
their
wideband
passport
x
k
ka
and
laser
detectors
youll
save
off
of
buying
them
separately
in
this
case
the
addition
of
the
laser
detector
over
the
passport
is
only
ie
passport
normally
costs
uniden
makes
an
all
in
one
unit
x
k
ka
laser
for
about
colorado
radar
sells
passive
radar
jammers
the
passive
supposedly
being
legal
for
about
wont
help
you
with
laser
however
