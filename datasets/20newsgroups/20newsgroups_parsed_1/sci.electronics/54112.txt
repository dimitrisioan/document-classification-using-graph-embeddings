is

be

in

lines
of
the
phone
wire
which
ones
are
those
suppose
i
am
holding
a
regular
phone
wire
such
that
the
little
plastic
tooth
on
the
little
plastic
square
thing
with
the
naked
lead
ends
that
you
plug
into
the
phone
is
facing
down
and
away
from
me
which
of
the
wires
that
i
see
is
the
tip
and
which
is
the
ring
please
reply

assuming
you
are
refering
to
standard
pots
or
ground
start
lines
if
you
are
looking
at
loop
start
lines
under
idle
conditions
the
ring
conductor
is
the
one
with
approximately
to
vdc
with
respect
to
ground
while
the
tip
conductor
is
at
or
very
near
ground
potential
be
sure
to
reference
the
telco
ground
when
taking
your
measurements
if
you
are
dealing
with
ground
start
lines
under
idle
conditions
the
ring
conductor
will
be
the
one
with
approximately
to
vdc
while
the
tip
conductor
would
look
like
its
floating
you
may
see
some
potential
from
line
capacitance
it
will
bleed
off
over
time
remember
to
use
the
telco
ground
as
your
reference
when
making
measurements
