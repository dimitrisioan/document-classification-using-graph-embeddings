dont
use
big
capacitors
they
are
unreliable
for
timing
due
to
leakage
true
especially
for
electrolytic
capacitors
at
high
temperature
instead
use
a
quartz
crystal
and
divide
its
frequency
by
times
or
something
like
that
wouldnt
a
crystal
be
affected
by
cold
my
gut
feeling
is
that
as
a
mechanically
resonating
device
extreme
cold
is
likely
to
affect
the
compliance
terminology
of
the
quartz
and
hence
its
resonant
frequency
low
power
quartz
oscillators
are
usually
khz
and
these
have
significant
temperature
drifts
which
one
doesnt
often
notice
while
wearing
the
watch
on
ones
wrist
low
temperature
sensitivity
is
available
in
other
crystal
types
which
unfortunately
are
larger
and
higher
frequency
mhz
or
so
and
take
more
battery
power
programmable
timers
might
be
less
accurate
but
they
are
more
powerstingy
than
suitable
crystal
oscillators
