for
a
project
of
my
own
i
would
like
to
build
a
infrared
remote
control
receiver
for
regular
vcrs
and
tvs
remotes
does
anybody
have
any
info
or
tips
on
how
to
build
such
receiver
in
particular
a
which
photo
detector
should
i
use
which
wavelength
do
remotes
use
b
which
ics
or
circuit
should
i
use
c
any
suggestions
for
circuit
layout
please
reply
to
this
group
if
you
wish
but
as
well
via
email
my
link
to
usenet
is
not
always
available
id
like
to
see
this
info
as
well
as
for
wavelength
i
think
youre
primarily
going
to
find
two
nm
a
bit
andor
nm
a
bit
usually
it
is
about
nm
either
way
the
two
most
common
i
have
seen
were
and
but
i
have
also
heard
of
and
im
not
sure
that
the
nm
one
way
or
another
will
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
another
suggestion
find
a
brand
of
tv
that
uses
an
ir
remote
and
go
look
at
the
sams
photofact
for
it
you
can
often
find
some
very
detailed
schematics
and
parts
list
for
not
only
the
receiver
but
the
transmitter
as
well
including
carrier
freq
specs
and
tone
decoding
specs
if
the
system
uses
that
duane
