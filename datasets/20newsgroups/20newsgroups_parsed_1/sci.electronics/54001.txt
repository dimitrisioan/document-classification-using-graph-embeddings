you
will
be
nailing
those
irleds
may
i
suggest
getting
your
mitts
on
the
siemens
sfh
irled
this
unit
is
designed
to
take
some
big
current
pulses
if
you
can
get
your
duty
cycle
down
a
bit
it
will
output
nearly
a
watt
mw
with
real
short
duty
cycle
times
nice
thing
about
the
sfh
is
that
it
is
cheap
i
got
mine
for
about
cents
a
piece
even
though
i
had
to
buy
of
them
are
you
saying
that
you
have
some
extras
that
you
would
like
to
do
some
cost
recovery
on
i
may
be
interested
i
think
for
practical
and
cost
reasons
i
am
limited
to
envelope
detection
so
that
leaves
me
with
only
increasing
the
output
power
and
increasing
the
optical
gain
at
the
receiver
as
methods
to
extend
range
btw
i
have
seen
irleds
with
outputs
up
to
wattshonest
watts
i
dont
have
the
book
here
at
work
so
i
cant
recall
the
company
name
the
watter
aint
cheap
around
but
if
you
want
some
power
mamamia
thats
pretty
hot
they
also
have
a
watt
a
watt
and
a
watt
device
in
their
line
and
will
sell
small
quan
to
individuals
if
you
are
interested
i
can
find
the
book
at
home
and
get
the
pertinent
info
yes
im
interested
in
the
company
name
i
have
access
to
an
extensive
data
book
collection
with
that
kind
of
power
are
we
getting
into
an
area
where
eye
safety
is
getting
to
be
a
problem
now
as
for
the
position
detector
you
might
try
eltec
in
florida
phone
number
listed
in
the
etid
is
they
seem
like
nice
people
their
specialty
is
passive
infrared
detection
devices
so
they
might
be
able
to
help
you
out
they
are
a
long
way
from
me
but
they
might
be
a
better
source
than
i
can
find
around
here
im
curious
about
your
applications
if
you
dont
mind
saying
the
device
sounds
like
it
could
be
useful
in
a
lasertag
game
although
youd
need
to
up
your
carrier
signal
concept
to
khz
im
keeping
my
application
confidential
for
now
raising
the
frequency
should
be
no
problem
in
fact
one
respondent
to
my
question
said
that
i
may
not
have
to
mimic
the
duty
cycle
normally
used
by
ir
detector
