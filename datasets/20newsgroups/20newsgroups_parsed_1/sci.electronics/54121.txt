do
you

any
assembly

at

all
anyone
needs
to
do
if
find
the
part
of
the
code
that
does
the
quiz
and
insert
a
jmp
instruction
to
just
completely
skip
it
not
that
difficult
really
and
there
is
very
little
that
commpanies
can
do
to
stop
this
type
of
thing
using
pklite
or
some
similar
utility
would
help
but
only
if
the
resulting
compressed
exe
were
tagged
as
uncompressable
and
even
that
doesnt
help
there
are
at
least
two
programs
available
that
fixes
this
unp
and
dislite
both
available
from
simtel
and
even
without
them
it
isnt
that
hard
to
fix
