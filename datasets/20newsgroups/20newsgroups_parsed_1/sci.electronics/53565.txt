legal
here
in
bc
ive
even
got
one

illegal
and
detection

ive
heard
the
police
in
ontario

a
much
more
direct
method
of
detection
just
trigger
the
radar
gun
watch
for
people
slamming
on
the
brakes
and
search
the

are
illegal
here

well
though
i
dont
know
what
methods

has
always
amazed
me
with
the
way
the
laws
work
it
is
not
illegal
to
sell

here
in
manitoba
only
to
have
them
within
a
vehicle

i
heard
