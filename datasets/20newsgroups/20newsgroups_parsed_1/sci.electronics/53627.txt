tv
reception
heelllppp
hello
i
just
canceled
my
support
of
the
cable
regime
and
i
would
like
to
at
least
pick
up
the
networks
and
nbc
i
do
not
have
tons
of
money
nor
even
a
few
pounds
so
what
i
am
looking
for
is
the
best
solution
for
reception
for
under
dollars
i
have
seen
modules
that
you
plug
into
your
wall
outlet
that
supposedly
make
your
entire
house
an
antenna
i
have
to
admit
even
with
my
limited
knowledge
of
wavelength
and
aerial
reception
this
seems
dubious
in
its
claims
for
excellent
reception
at
best
ill
try
anything
though
if
it
works
i
am
in
a
nonmountainous
area
approximately
miles
from
the
transmitting
stations
which
are
pretty
large
montgomery
alabama
pop
and
colombus
goergia
pop
any
recommendations
of
products
brandnames
prices
and
company
info
catalog
ordering
numbers
addresses
etc
thank
you
in
advance
