on
december
it
was
illegal
to
operate
a
radar
detector
in
the
state
of
virginia
if
one
got
caught
one
got
fined
the
federal
communications
act
of
made
it
legal
for
you
to
operate
a
radio
receiver
of
any
kind
on
any
frequency
including
x
k
and
ka
bands
in
the
united
states
and
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
has
not
exactly
butted
against
the
issue
on
those
grounds
the
claim
is
that
as
a
matter
of
traffic
safety
one
is
not
allowed
to
have
a
functioning
radar
detector
on
the
dashboard
while
operating
a
motor
vehicle
yes
the
argument
is
bogus
but
it
hasnt
been
successfully
challenged
in
court
yet
