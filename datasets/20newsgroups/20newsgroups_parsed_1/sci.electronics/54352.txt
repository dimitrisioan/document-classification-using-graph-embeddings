not
that
the
question
is
anything
important
but
i
am
still
curious
why
is
that
almost
all
printed
circuit
boards
are
green
i
have
seen
a
few
blue
ones
but
no
red
yellow
company
logo
etc
is
there
a
technical
reason
or
could
it
be
that
the
marketing
geniuses
have
not
tought
about
it
yet
its
possible
to
make
boards
in
other
colors
and
i
have
an
ad
for
laser
lightshow
equipment
which
offers
the
circuit
boards
in
your
choice
of
dayglo
tm
colors
the
usual
light
green
color
is
just
the
natural
color
of
fiberglas
the
dark
green
or
blue
is
the
solder
mask
layer
and
i
suspect
that
color
is
a
dye
