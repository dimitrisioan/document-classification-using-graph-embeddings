i
built
a
little
project
using
the
radio
shack
vdc
relays
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretty
bad
clicks
when
the
thing
switched
i
was
doing
most
of
the
common
things
one
is
supposed
to
do
when
using
relays
and
nothing
seemed
to
get
rid
of
the
clicks
my
question
is
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switching
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
noise
of
any
kind
on
the
audio
lines
i
will
appreciate
any
advice
or
references
to
advice
also
exact
part
numberscompany
names
etc
for
the
relays
will
help
the
first
step
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
dc
component
intentional
or
not
on
the
audio
lines
to
be
switched
if
neither
the
output
or
input
presents
an
unintentional
dc
level
lets
say
theyre
capacitively
coupled
then
putting
a
k
resistor
from
each
input
to
ground
and
from
the
output
to
ground
is
a
good
precaution
against
leakage
in
any
coupling
caps
presenting
a
dc
level
that
is
guaranteed
to
cause
a
click
if
the
device
presents
an
unintentional
dc
level
that
is
from
more
than
just
coupling
capacitor
leakage
then
you
need
to
remove
the
dc
before
switching
with
coupling
capacitors
of
your
own
if
you
have
more
than
one
relay
each
relay
switching
one
input
through
to
a
common
output
you
can
use
makebeforebreak
switching
where
for
a
brief
instant
both
sources
are
connected
during
a
switch
change
this
may
mask
the
switch
click
an
audio
switch
that
is
clickless
is
made
by
taking
a
light
bulb
and
making
your
own
ersatz
optoisolator
with
a
lightdependent
resistor
ldr
sealed
inside
a
piece
of
black
heatshrink
many
broadcast
consoles
use
this
older
but
timehonored
technique
claro
actually
makes
a
complete
optisolator
like
this
but
i
dont
have
a
part
number
handy
radio
shack
has
a
ldr
grabbag
you
might
want
to
try
for
a
simple
solid
state
clickless
switch
that
is
cheap
you
might
try
looking
at
the
cd
analog
switch
that
is
commonly
available
or
its
older
predecessor
the
again
the
dc
component
must
be
removed
prior
to
switching
other
alternatives
include
jfet
switches
both
discrete
and
ic
and
diode
switching
which
works
relatively
well
surprisingly
all
the
above
with
their
pitfalls
and
application
tips
could
easily
make
a
subject
for
a
multipage
article
solid
state
switches
may
induce
a
click
of
their
own
when
turned
on
due
to
charge
being
injected
into
the
audio
line
through
device
capacitance
when
the
control
signal
changes
state
techniques
to
minimize
this
include
lowering
the
impedance
of
the
signal
paths
through
the
switch
differential
switching
and
slowing
the
risetime
of
the
control
pulse
with
the
cutting
the
click
can
be
as
simple
as
putting
k
k
resistors
in
series
with
the
control
pins
hope
this
helps
at
least
get
you
started
