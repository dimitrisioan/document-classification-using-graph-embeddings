i
am
trying
to
build
a
circuit
that
detects
the
presence
of
video
vs
a
blank
screen
by
monitoring
the
rg
and
b
outputs
of
a
graphics
card
it
should
be
able
to
detect
the
presence
of
a
single
pixel
at
mhz
which
would
mean
detecting
a
ns
pulse
it
should
also
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
blank
screen
about
mv
and
a
dim
screen
say
around
mv
oh
yes
it
also
needs
to
be
cheap
in
fact
the
difference
between
completely
black
and
completely
white
is
only
mv
i
am
wondering
if
i
am
going
to
have
to
amplify
the
video
signals
to
make
this
work
try
a
differential
amplifier
put
backtoback
diodes
between
the
collectors
restrict
the
voltage
swing
have
ma
flow
with
ohm
collector
rs
and
keep
the
stray
c
below
pf
try
ns
run
collector
to
your
logic
