i
thought
the
first
thread
was
hilarious
so
here
goes
another
post
some
more
background
information
on
what
has
happened
to
my
poor
batteries
one
year
i
left
the
batteries
in
the
garage
the
garage
is
unheated
they
were
left
in
their
places
that
they
needed
to
be
one
in
the
riding
lawnmower
what
a
lux
and
one
in
each
motorcycle
the
battery
in
the
riding
lawnmower
was
about
years
old
and
one
of
the
cycle
batteries
was
new
and
one
was
around
years
old
upon
spring
time
i
discovered
that
all
of
the
batteries
were
dead
and
needed
to
be
recharged
they
all
worked
properly
except
for
the
older
ones
and
they
had
to
be
replaced
about
halfway
through
the
summer
they
had
originally
been
stored
in
the
garage
and
i
think
i
remember
my
dad
charging
them
in
spring
last
year
i
decided
to
bring
them
in
to
the
basement
which
has
two
parts
one
is
dirt
and
brick
and
the
other
is
concrete
i
brought
in
all
three
and
discovered
in
the
spring
about
days
ago
that
not
only
were
the
batteries
dead
but
when
i
put
the
charger
on
them
the
charger
said
hmmmmmmmm
and
the
ampmeter
read
around
in
other
words
it
was
pinned
the
internal
circut
tripped
and
i
went
on
to
the
other
batteries
they
were
the
same
realizing
that
we
still
had
gigantic
sailboat
batteries
also
lead
acid
i
decided
to
put
the
charger
on
them
these
had
been
sitting
for
around
and
a
half
years
on
the
brick
and
dirt
part
and
noticed
that
they
only
needed
a
small
charge
around
hours
or
so
on
trickle
i
tested
them
by
using
them
at
the
local
gas
station
for
giving
jump
starts
and
they
worked
fine
for
around
of
em
this
leads
me
to
believe
one
of
several
things
i
bought
really
tty
batteries
last
year
sorta
true
the
concrete
has
something
to
do
with
the
discharge
of
the
batteries
there
was
enough
moisture
to
short
out
the
terminals
in
the
room
where
the
concrete
is
the
dirt
room
was
able
to
absorb
the
moisture
in
the
air
better
than
concrete
btw
i
can
almost
waterski
in
the
dirt
room
any
other
ideas
could
be
the
aliens
anything
is
possible
the
leadacid
secondary
cell
releases
energy
electricity
with
the
following
chemical
reaction
pb
pbo
hso
pbso
h
lead
and
lead
iv
oxide
and
sulfuric
acid
produce
lead
sulfate
and
water
the
standard
heats
of
formation
at
c
f
of
the
various
compounds
are
heat
of
formation
compound
at
c
kcalmole
pb
pbo
hso
pbso
h
the
heat
of
reaction
at
c
is
therefore
kcal
per
mole
pbso
produced
note
that
lead
sulfate
is
not
very
soluble
grams
per
grams
water
at
c
and
it
will
thus
precipitate
out
of
solution
where
the
reaction
is
occurring
or
the
cathode
positive
terminal
of
the
battery
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
the
positive
terminal
where
the
precipitate
forms
but
i
may
be
wrong
oh
well
i
dont
have
a
corroded
battery
to
corrobate
and
i
dont
feel
like
thinking
through
it
right
now
what
is
important
to
notice
here
is
that
the
reaction
as
you
knew
it
would
be
is
exothermic
or
energy
discharging
if
moisture
with
dissolved
electrolytes
acid
rain
condenses
on
the
battery
a
conductive
path
between
the
terminals
may
form
this
will
discharge
the
battery
as
the
chemical
reaction
proceeds
the
reaction
is
reversible
if
electricity
from
an
alternator
or
battery
charger
is
put
back
into
the
battery
leadacid
batteries
must
change
in
chemical
composition
to
discharge
each
cell
has
all
the
reactants
necessary
for
the
reaction
the
nonreacting
posts
terminals
of
the
leadacid
battery
are
there
to
remove
or
add
electric
energy
during
a
discharge
or
charge
because
the
reaction
is
exothermic
it
has
a
tendency
to
happen
though
quite
slowly
under
normal
circumstances
so
while
keeping
the
battery
dry
is
a
good
idea
it
is
not
a
total
solution
to
understand
why
leadacid
batteries
do
indeed
discharge
faster
when
stored
on
concrete
as
opposed
to
wood
or
earth
dirt
one
should
recall
lechateliers
principle
which
can
be
paraphrased
as
anything
subjected
to
some
stress
will
act
to
move
to
a
more
comfortable
position
here
are
the
thermal
conductivities
of
a
some
selected

note
that
the
thermal
conductivity
for
dirt
diatomaceous
earth
goes
down
with
temperature
also
c
is
about
k
and
the
values
for
earth
powder
are
on
the
same
order
of
magnitude
as
natural
earth
the
thermal
conductivity
of
concrete
is
around
a
factor
of
greater
than
that
of
dirt
and
is
times
greater
than
wood
it
is
these
differences
in
thermal
conductivity
that
cause
the
battery
on
concrete
to
discharge
faster
than
that
on
dirt
or
wood
at
any
instant
the
discharge
reaction
is
occurring
energy
is
being
released
either
as
electricity
or
heat
thermal
conductivity
of
air
is
about
btuhrftftfft
during
storage
except
for
the
trickle
that
passes
through
any
condensate
on
the
battery
this
energy
is
mostly
released
as
heat
the
higher
conductivity
surface
will
remove
the
heat
proportionately
faster
than
the
lower
conductivity
surface
thus
if
you
perfectly
insulated
a
dry
battery
on
all
but
the
bottom
surface
at
any
given
battery
temperature
above
the
storage
surface
temperature
the
battery
on
a
concrete
surface
will
be
discharging
about
times
faster
than
that
on
dirt
this
is
where
lechateliers
principle
comes
into
play
removing
energy
from
the
exothermic
reaction
will
drive
the
reaction
further
to
completion
if
the
reaction
normally
occurs
at
room
temperature
keeping
the
battery
at
that
temperature
requires
the
removal
of
any
heat
produced
a
concrete
surface
is
a
better
heat
sink
than
a
dirt
or
wood
surface
store
a
battery
in
the
corner
of
a
poured
concrete
basement
and
you
have
surfaces
removing
energy
which
pulls
the
reaction
along
also
if
water
evaporates
from
the
battery
that
elevates
the
ratio
of
sulfuric
acid
to
water
this
will
tend
to
drive
the
discharge
reaction
