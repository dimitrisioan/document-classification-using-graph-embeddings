hard
drive
component
costs
does
anyone
have
some
information
on
the
relative
fraction
of
the
final
cost
of
each
component
in
an
average
hard
drive
for
instance
im
pretty
sure
the
heads
and
the
platters
are
the
most
expensive
parts
with
the
assembly
costs
running
a
close
third
cost
of
the
electronics
is
likely
in
the
noise
any
hard
numbers
or
percentage
