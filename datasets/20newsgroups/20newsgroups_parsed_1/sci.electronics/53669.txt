obo
i
havent

input

modulation
broken
means
the
crt
produces
a
nice
bright
trace
but
the
trace
does
not
correspond
to
the
input
signal
my
guess
is
its
repairable
but
more
than
a
simple
calibration
problembut
i
honestly
have
not
tried
to
calibrate
the
scope
or
otherwise
fix
it
its
asis
i
paid
for
it
in
its
current
state
i
bought
it
thinking
id
repair
it
using
the
good
scope
for
sidebyside
comparisonsince
ive
sold
the
good
scope
the
bad
one
doesnt
do
me
much
good
and
id
like
to
recoup
that
amount
as
above
ill
accept
offers
and
take
the
best
one
id
prefer
a
local
bay
area
california
buyer
so
a
i
dont
have
to
ship
it
and
b
she
or
he
can
examine
the
scope
prior
to
purchase
