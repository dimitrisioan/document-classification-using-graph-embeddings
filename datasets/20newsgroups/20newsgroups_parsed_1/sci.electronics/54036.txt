there
are
a
few
bubblejets
out
there
that
produce
rather
mediocre

hps
dinky

most
produce
really
good
looking
output
such

hps
deskjets
ibm
and
canon
both
produce

the
really
good
style
bubblejets
i
am
considering
either
an
inkjet
or
bubble
jet
printer
ive
seen
inkjet
printers
and
i
was
impressed
with
the
near
lazer
quality
i
have
heard
a
lot
of
bad
things
about
the
cheaper
bubblejet
printers
does
the
ink
smudge
very
easily
and
take
a
long
time
to
dry
thanks
