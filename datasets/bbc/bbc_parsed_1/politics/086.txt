stem
cell

michael
howard
has
backed
stem
cell
research
saying
it
is
important
people
are
not
frightened
of
the
future
the
controversial
issue
was
a
feature
of
the
recent
us
presidential
election
where
george
bush
opposed
extending
it
but
the
tory
leader
argued
there
was
a
moral
case
for
embracing
science
which
could
help
victims
of
alzheimers
parkinsons
and
motor
neurone
disease
i
believe
we
have
a
duty
to
offer
hope
to
the
millions
of
people
who
suffer
devastating
illnesses
he
said
the
use
of
embryonic
stem
cells
in
the
uk
is
already
allowed
stem
cells
are
master
cells
that
have
the
ability
to
develop
into
any
of
the
bodys
tissue
types
scientists
hope
that
by
growing
such
cells
in
the
laboratory
they
can
programme
them
to
form
specific
tissue
such
as
kidney
heart
or
even
brain
tissue
mr
howard
acknowledged
there
were
genuine
concerns
about
stem
cell
research
but
he
argued
we
mustnt
be
frightened
of
change
or
nostalgic
about
the
past
we
must
be
optimistic
about
the
future
politicians
must
create
the
right
framework
so
that
the
great
potential
of
science
can
be
harnessed
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
with
the
life
expectancy
of
the
average
briton
now
around
the
mids
society
has
a
responsibility
to
enhance
the
quality
of
peoples
lives
as
they
grow
older
i
know
many
people
are
concerned
about
stemcell
research
they
are
fearful
of
meddling
with
what
they
see
as
the
stuff
of
souls
i
respect
those
concerns
but
i
also
believe
we
have
a
duty
to
offer
hope
to
the
millions
of
people
who
suffer
devastating
illnesses
like
parkinsons
multiple
sclerosis
motor
neurone
disease
alzheimers
and
as
we
saw
in
the
papers
today
now
possibly
heart
problems
mr
howard
acknowledged
there
were
no
easy
answers
over
such
an
issue
but
it
was
necessary
to
have
the
courage
to
do
what
we
know
to
be
morally
right
he
added
of
course
stem
cells
are
still
a
recent
discovery
more
research
needs
to
be
done
but
we
must
look
at
their
potential
in
a
responsible
and
grownup
way
the
hopes
of
millions
of
people
rest
on
what
could
be
achieved
former
superman
actor
the
late
christopher
reeve
was
an
advocate
for
the
research
after
he
was
paralysed
in
a
horse
riding
accident
mr
howard
made
his
remarks
during
a
speech
in
westminster
to
the
conservative
national
womens
committee
on
ambitions
and
values
