public

in

can
only
be
restored
if
gordon
brown
opens
up
his
books
for
unbiased
inspection
say
the

city
experts
say
there
is
a
â£bn
black
hole
in

finances
a
claim
denied
by
the
chancellor
lib
dem
spokesman
vince
cable
said
the
public
did
not
know
who
to
believe
and
the
national
audit
office
should
judge
responding
to
the
prebudget
report
mr
cable
also
attacked
labours
unfair
and
overcomplicated
taxes
in
his
report
mr
brown
insisted
he
was
on
course
to
meet
his
golden
rule
of
borrowing
only
to
invest
rather
than
for
daytoday
spending
over
the
course
of
the
economic
cycle
mr
cable
said
people
did
not
know
whether
to
believe
the
chancellor
or
the
consensus
among
experts
which
said
the
rule
would
be
broken
there
is
an
issue
of
credibility
and
trust
he
said
we
can
not
have
a
continuation
of
a
situation
where
the
chancellor
sets
his
own
tests
and
then
marks
them
what
we
need
is
the
equivalent
of
a
thorough
ofsted
inspection
of
the
governments
accounts
he
asked
what
the
government
had
to
hide
mr
cable
also
accused
the
chancellor
of
ducking
tough
choices
he
argued
there
are
serious
challenges
ahead
from
the
falling
dollar
and
from
the
rapid
downturn
in
the
uk
housing
market
and
rising
personal
debt
but
they
have
not
been
confronted
mr
brown
confirmed
he
was
setting
aside
another
â£m
for
the
conflicts
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
mr
cable
compared
that
new
cost
with
the
â£m
needed
for
britains
role
in
the
entire
first
gulf
war
when
of
the
bill
had
been
met
through
help
from
european
and
arab
nations
he
suggested
keeping
british
troops
in
iraq
could
cost
another
â£bn
with
the
government
also
planning
to
spend
at
least
â£bn
for
identity
cards
the
current
economic
climate
meant
britain
could
not
afford
the
reckless
george
bushstyle
tax
cutting
spree
planned
by
the
tories
he
said
instead
what
was
needed
was
simple
and
fair
taxation
rather
than
the
complete
mess
produced
by
mr
browns
endless
tinkering
mr
cable
said
of
all
pensioners
were
now
paying
marginal
tax
rates
of
and
oneandahalf
million
hard
working
families
were
paying
marginal
tax
rates
with
that
record
he
asked
why
ministers
attacked
lib
dem
plans
for
a
new
tax
rate
for
the
very
rich
those
earning
more
than
â£
a
year
mr
brown
earmarked
â£bn
to
help
keep
down
council
tax
rises
next
year
but
the
lib
dem
spokesman
questioned
whether
that
money
was
being
found
from
cuts
to
education
and
health
he
urged
the
government
to
scrap
the
grossly
unfair
tax
completely
the
lib
dems
want
it
replaced
with
a
local
income
tax
in
response
mr
brown
stressed
the
iraq
money
came
from
a
reserve
funds
it
was
because
he
had
rejected
previous
lib
dem
proposals
such
as
scrapping
the
new
deal
that
britains
economy
was
successful
claimed
mr
brown
