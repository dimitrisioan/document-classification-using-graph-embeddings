spokesman
fraser
kemp
said
veritas
was
joining
an
already
crowded
field
on
the
right
of
british
politics
mr
kilroysilk
was
joined
in
the
new
venture
by
one
of
ukips
two
london
assembly
members
damien
hockney
who
is
now
veritas
deputy
leader
ukips
chairman
petrina
holdsworth
has
said
the
group
will
just
be
a
parody
of
the
party
the
men
have
left
mr
kilroysilk
quit
ukip
last
week
after
months
of
tension
as
he
vied
unsuccessfully
for
the
leadership
of
that
party
he
said
he
was
ashamed
to
be
a
member
of
a
ukip
whose
leadership
had
gone
awol
after
the
great
opportunity
offered
by
its
third
place
at
last
junes
european
elections
ukips
leader
roger
knapman
has
said
he
is
glad
to
see
the
back
of
mr
kilroysilk
he
has
remarkable
ability
to
influence
people
but
sadly
after
the
european
election
it
became
clear
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
party
than
the
uk
independence
party
so
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
he
said
ukip
officials
also
argue
mr
kilroysilk
has
not
been
straightforward
in
attacking
the
party
he
once
wanted
to
lead
