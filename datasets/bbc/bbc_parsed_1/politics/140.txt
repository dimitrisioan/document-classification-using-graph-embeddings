development
funding
will
enable
more
survivors
to
have
access
to
antiretroviral
treatment
the
plight
of
the
infected
women
was
overshadowed
for
a
long
time
it
was
overshadowed
by
rwandas
emergence
from
the
days
of
slaughter
during
which
time
the
mass
killings
took
place
and
the
womens
fate
was
largely
a
taboo
subject
but
many
of
the
women
were
widowed
and
they
now
not
only
have
their
own
children
to
care
for
but
in
many
cases
orphans
too
as
the
women
die
the
number
of
rwandas
orphans
rises
until
recently
very
few
of
the
women
have
had
access
to
antiretroviral
treatment
that
is
now
starting
to
change
this
funding
is
intended
to
make
antiretrovirals
and
other
care
available
for
some
women

one
of

through
which
the

are
being
channelled
said
it
was
a
recognition
before
it
was
too
late
that
the
survivors
should
be
a
priority
for
help
