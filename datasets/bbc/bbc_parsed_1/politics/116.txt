has
warned

he
said
replacing
the

would
be
the
nuclear

a
report
by

called
for
the

be
wound
up
unless

improved
its

within

chairman
sir
archy

said
if
the

then
it
must
be
replaced
the

reached
its
conclusions
after
it
found
that
nearly
cases
have
yet
to
be
processed
it
warned
that
it
could
be
five
years
before
the
csa
was
fit
for

it
as
a
failing
organisation
and
in

mr
johnson
told
bbc
radio
s
today
programme
i
certainly
wouldnt
rule
out
the
nuclear
option
of
moving
to
a
completely
new
system
but
i
think
the
select
committee
would
agree
with
me
we
would
only
do
that
when
we
were
absolutely
convinced
that
this
system
just
isnt
going
to
work
the
mps
launched
their
inquiry
into
the
csas
performance
after
it
became
clear
that
despite
the
introduction
of
a
simpler
system
of
calculating
maintenance
payments
for
new
cases
in
a
backlog
of
claims
was
building
up

the
