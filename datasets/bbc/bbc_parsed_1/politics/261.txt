labours
election
lovein
peace
and
love
have
been
in
short
supply
in
the
labour
party
in
recent
days
if
press
reports
are
to
be
believed
alan
milburn
and
gordon
brown
have
been
at
each
others
throats
over
the
contents
of
labours
next
election
manifesto
but
the
pair
were
all
smiles
on
tuesday
morning
as
they
joined
john
prescott
to
unveil
labours
latest
poster
campaign
the
event
at
old
billingsgate
fish
market
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
was
a
carefully
choreographed
show
of
unity
and
the
surest
sign
yet
that
we
are
heading
for
a
general
election
in
the
next
few
months
it
was
also
one
of
the
most
bizarre
photo
opportunities
of
recent
years
the
first
inkling
something
slightly
odd
was
afoot
was
when
in
place
of
the
soft
rock
music
normally
chosen
for
such
occasions
labours
speakers
crackled
to
life
with
the
sound
of
booker
t
and
the
mgs
then
a
vw
camper
van
trundled
into
view
decked
out
in
that
most
mindbending
of
psychedelic
messages
lowest
mortgage
rate
for
years
as
the
sidedoor
slid
open
it
looked
for
one
glorious
moment
as
if
the
cabinet
had
decided
to
bury
their
differences
and
go
on
the
road
together
scooby
doostyle
but
sadly
it
wasnt
the
cabinet
who
had
raided
the
dressingup
box
just
six
rather
illatease
looking
labour
students
two
were
dressed
as
regency
dandies
to
unveil
a
poster
trumpeting
the
longest
period
of
economic
growth
for
years
another
pair
of
students
were
in
a
beatle
wig
and
sgt
pepper
jacket
to
highlight
the
lowest
interest
rates
since
the
s
the
remaining
two
were
dressed
in
a
vague
approximation
of
disco
chic
to
demonstrate
the
lowest
unemployment
since
the
seventies
the
politicians
led
out
by
john
prescott
were
soberlysuited
as
always
the
event
may
have
been
designed
to
highlight
labours
economic
success
under
mr
brown
but
there
was
little
doubt
who
was
in
charge
the
chancellor
walked
sidebyside
with
mr
milburn
pointedly
exchanging
chit
chat
as
they
approached
the
microphone
but
it
was
mr
milburn
who
took
centre
stage
speaking
of
the
positive
campaign
the
party
hoped
to
stage
in
the
coming
weeks
and
months
the
mobile
poster
vans
would
let
people
know
britain
is
working
again
mr
brown
repeated
the
familiar
mantras
displayed
on
the
posters
and
spoke
of
labours
shared
purpose
and
united
dedication
it
was
left
to
mr
prescott
to
pay
glowing
tribute
to
the
chancellors
record
and
in
a
final
flourish
to
produce
his
famous
pledge
card
from
claiming
labour
has
met
all
of
its
promises
the
event
was
carefully
stagemanaged
to
underline
cabinet
unity
and
more
specifically
to
demonstrate
the
central
role
mr
brown
will
play
in
the
election
campaign
despite
being
sidelined
as
campaign
chief
in
favour
of
mr
milburn
but
keen
students
of
body
language
will
have
had
a
field
day
there
was
much
forced
smiling
for
the
cameras
but
only
mr
prescott
who
revels
in
such
occasions
seemed
to
be
truly
enjoying
himself
mr
milburn
made
a
point
of
turning
to
face
the
chancellor
as
he
spoke
nodding
thoughtfully
but
it
was
the
former
health
secretarys
final
gesture
placing
an
arm
on
mr
browns
back
as
they
walked
away
from
the
microphones
which
was
perhaps
the
most
telling
thanks
for
dropping
by
gordon
he
might
have
been
saying
