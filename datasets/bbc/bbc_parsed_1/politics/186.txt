tory
leader
michael
howard
asked
about
mr
livingstones
remark
by
reporters
said
it
was
important
for
politicians
to
be
mindful
about
the
language
they
use
its
particularly
important
that
as
we
get
close
to
the
election
that
politicians
talk
with
civility
and
courtesy
about
issues
that
we
all
face
he
said
i
think
its
a
matter
of
sadness
that
we
are
not
seeing
that
from
the
labour
party
we
had
what
ken
livingstone
said
we
had
what
alastair
campbell
has
said
and
we
have
what
others
have
said
i
think
thats
a
matter
of
great
regret

livingstone

the

then
says

but
actually
you
are
like
