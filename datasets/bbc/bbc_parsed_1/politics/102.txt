blunkett
row
should
end
blair
prime
minister
tony
blair
said
it
was
time
to
draw
a
line
under
the
controversy
surrounding
david
blunkett
the
tories
and
the
lib
dems
have
called
for
a
second
inquiry
into
the
fasttracking
of
a
visa
application
for
mr
blunketts
exlovers
nanny
sir
alan
budd
found
a
chain
of
events
linked
mr
blunkett
to
leoncia
casalmes
indefinite
leave
to
remain
application
at
the
end
of
his
middle
east
trip
mr
blair
said
he
still
admired
mr
blunkett
and
thought
his
integrity
was
intact
on
tuesday
sir
alan
said
the
application
for
leave
to
remain
in
the
uk
made
by
kimberly
quinns
nanny
was
processed
in
days
days
faster
than
the
average
but
he
could
not
find
evidence
to
show
whether
mr
blunketts
intervention
was
intended
to
give
special
help
for
his
then
lovers
nanny
or
if
he
was
raising
the
case
as
an
example
of
poor
departmental
performance
in
his
first
comments
since
sir
alans
announcement
mr
blair
told
bbc
news
he
had
not
yet
read
the
report
in
detail
but
told
bbc
news
as
far
as
im
concerned
we
have
drawn
a
line
under
that
asked
if
mr
blunkett
could
return
to
frontline
politics
at
some
point
he
replied
i
have
made
my
admiration
for
david
very
clear
and
it
remains
hes
been
a
tremendous
colleague
hes
done
a
great
job
for
us
first
as
home
secretary
then
as
education
secretary
the
future
is
something
we
will
have
to
approach
in
the
future
the
prime
minister
shrugged
off
claims
from
conservative
leader
michael
howard
that
he
led
a
grubby
government
he
said
mr
blunketts
integrity
remained
intact
he
was
the
person
first
of
all
who
asked
for
this
inquiry
to
be
set
up
he
accepted
that
what
he
originally
thought
had
happened
had
not
happened
he
said
but
i
think
sir
alan
budd
also
accepted
there
wasnt
some
conspiracy
or
coverup
and
i
just
think
a
line
should
be
drawn
under
now
and
we
should
move
on
earlier
mr
howard
said
there
does
need
to
be
another
inquiry
a
judgeled
inquiry
there
were
so
many
questions
that
werent
answered
there
was
deceit
at
the
heart
of
government
which
was
not
limited
to
the
visa
affair
he
argued
lib
dem
home
affairs
spokesman
mark
oaten
also
said
there
was
a
strong
case
for
a
judgeled
judicial
review
he
said
next
time
it
happens
it
may
not
be
about
a
nanny
and
their
visa
it
may
be
about
something
even
more
important
than
that
mr
blunkett
quit
as
home
secretary
last
week
after
being
told
in
advance
of
sir
alans
findings
in
a
statement
the
exhome
secretary
said
he
accepted
the
inquirys
findings
he
said
he
had
told
the
truth
throughout
and
had
raised
the
nanny
case
as
an
example
of
unacceptable
backlogs
in
the
system
