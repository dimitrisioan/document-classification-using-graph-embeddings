gordon
brown
will
seek
to
put
the
economy
at
the
centre
of
labours
bid
for
a
third
term
in
power
when
he
delivers
his
ninth
budget
at
gmt
he
is
expected
to
stress
the
importance
of
continued
economic
stability
with
low
unemployment
and
interest
rates
the
chancellor
is
expected
to
freeze
petrol
duty
and
raise
the
stamp
duty
threshold
from
â£
but
the
conservatives
and
lib
dems
insist
voters
face
higher
taxes
and
more
meanstesting
under
labour
treasury
officials
have
said
there
will
not
be
a
preelection
giveaway
but
mr
brown
is
thought
to
have
about
â£bn
to
spare
increase
in
the
stamp
duty
threshold
from
â£
a
freeze
on
petrol
duty
an
extension
of
tax
credit
scheme
for
poorer
families
possible
help
for
pensioners
the
stamp
duty
threshold
rise
is
intended
to
help
first
time
buyers
a
likely
theme
of
all
three
of
the
main
parties
general
election
manifestos
ten
years
ago
buyers
had
a
much
greater
chance
of
avoiding
stamp
duty
with
close
to
half
a
million
properties
in
england
and
wales
alone
selling
for
less
than
â£
since
then
average
uk
property
prices
have
more
than
doubled
while
the
starting
threshold
for
stamp
duty
has
not
increased
tax
credits
as
a
result
the
number
of
properties
incurring
stamp
duty
has
rocketed
as
has
the
governments
tax
take
the
liberal
democrats
unveiled
their
own
proposals
to
raise
the
stamp
duty
threshold
to
â£
in
february
the
tories
are
also
thought
likely
to
propose
increased
thresholds
with
shadow
chancellor
oliver
letwin
branding
stamp
duty
a
classic
labour
stealth
tax
the
tories
say
whatever
the
chancellor
gives
away
will
be
clawed
back
in
higher
taxes
if
labour
is
returned
to
power
shadow
treasury
chief
secretary
george
osborne
said
everyone
who
looks
at
the
british
economy
at
the
moment
says
there
has
been
a
sharp
deterioration
in
the
public
finances
that
there
is
a
black
hole
he
said
if
labour
is
elected
there
will
be
a
very
substantial
tax
increase
in
the
budget
after
the
election
of
the
order
of
around
â£bn
but
mr
browns
former
advisor
ed
balls
now
a
parliamentary
hopeful
said
an
examination
of
tory
plans
for
the
economy
showed
there
would
be
a
â£bn
difference
in
investment
by
the
end
of
the
next
parliament
between
the
two
main
parties
he
added
i
dont
accept
there
is
any
need
for
any
changes
to
the
plans
we
have
set
out
to
meet
our
spending
commitments
for
the
lib
dems
david
laws
said
the
chancellor
will
no
doubt
tell
us
today
how
wonderfully
the
economy
is
doing
he
said
but
a
lot
of
that
is
built
on
an
increase
in
personal
and
consumer
debt
over
the
last
few
years
that
makes
the
economy
quite
vulnerable
potentially
if
interest
rates
ever
do
have
to
go
up
in
a
significant
way
snp
leader
alex
salmond
said
his
party
would
introduce
a
â£
grant
for
first
time
buyers
reduce
corporation
tax
and
introduce
a
citizens

said
he
wanted
