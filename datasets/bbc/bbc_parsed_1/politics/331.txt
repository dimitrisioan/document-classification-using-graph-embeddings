labour
attacked
on
howard
poster
labour
has
been
accused
of
using
antisemitic
images
in
posters
which
critics
claim
depict
tory
leader
michael
howard
as
fagin
the
poster
shows
mr
howard
hypnotising
people
with
a
pocket
watch
saying
i
can
spend
the
same
money
twice
the
image
prompted
concern
from
the
editor
of
the
jewish
chronicle
but
labour
insists
it
is
simply
antitory
labour
later
took
the
image
off
its
website
saying
an
alternative
idea
had
proved
more
popular
with
party
members
the
party
will
now
use
focus
groups
to
test
a
poster
showing
mr
howard
and
shadow
chancellor
oliver
letwin
with
a
blackboard
reading
the
hypnotism
poster
has
been
compared
to
the
portrayal
of
the
dickens
character
fagin
in
the
stage
version
of
the
musical
oliver
there
was
controversy
over
another
poster
choice
offered
to
labour
members
it
showed
mr
howard
and
mr
letwin
who
are
both
jewish
as
flying
pigs
mr
howard
did
not
comment
on
the
antisemitism
claims
when
asked
about
the
poster
on
monday
instead
he
pointed
to
how
tony
blair
had
in
complained
about
personalised
abusive
campaigning
mr
howard
told
greater
manchester
radio
it
is
such
a
pity
that
mr
blair
doesnt
practise
what
he
preaches
jewish
chronicle
editor
ned
temko
said
there
had
been
a
mixed
reaction
to
the
first
poster
but
emails
from
jewish
chronicle
readers
showed
deeper
concern
about
the
hypnotism
image
shylock
and
fagin
are
inextricably
linked
to
notions
of
centuriesold
prejudice
he
told
bbc
radio
s
world
at
one
whatever
the
idea
is
i
think
its
a
difficult
exercise
to
use
images
like
that
and
to
argue
that
you
can
divorce
them
from
their
historical
context
or
meaning
mr
temko
said
he
blamed
cockup
not
conspiracy
saying
he
did
not
detect
inherent
antisemitism
in
any
of
the
parties
election
campaigns
the
poster
is
among
one
of
a
series
of
ideas
shown
to
labour
members
who
have
been
asked
to
choose
which
one
should
be
used
ahead
of
the
election
labour
mp
louise
ellman
said
the
hypnotism
image
was
insensitive
but
urged
people
not
to
rush
to
call
things
antisemitic
when
they
only
challenged
tory
economic
policies
labour
campaign
spokesman
fraser
kemp
said
the
poster
had
been
misunderstood
the
image
simply
portrayed
mr
howard
as
a
hypnotist
he
argued
concern
has
been
expressed
and
clearly
we
have
to
take
those
views
on
board
but
i
would
emphasise
that
if
you
see
the
posters
the
common
theme
is
that
the
tories
are
trying
to
con
you
a
labour
spokesman
later
said
the
timing
of
removing
the
controversial
image
from
the
partys
website
was
not
affected
by
the
row
this
has
been
up
on
the
website
for
two
weeks
and
there
has
only
been
a
fuss
in
the
last
four
days
so
a
substantial
number
of
people
voted
before
there
was
any
fuss
he
said
but
a
conservative
spokeswoman
said
this
poster
campaign
which
was
offensive
to
many
people
was
a
big
misjudgement
by
labours
campaign
team
