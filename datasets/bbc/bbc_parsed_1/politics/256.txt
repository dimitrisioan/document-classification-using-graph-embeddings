telegraph
journalist

went
back
on
a
pledge
to
make
way
for
mr

after
cabinet
allies
intervened
in

it
has
caused
a
new
wave
of
concern
among
labour
mps
gearing
up
to
defend
their
seats
in
an
election
widely
expected

their
discontent

the
plp
meeting
health
secretary
john
reid
earlier
warned
that
labour
members
would
not
easily
forgive
anybody
fuelling
damaging
speculation
he
told
bbc
news
those
who
cooperate
or
inspire
these
books
in
my
view
have
to
know
that
whatever
the
shortterm
political
or
personal
advantage
that
they
think
they
might
secure
they
always
do
it
by
damaging
the
record
the
unity
and
the
reelection
chances
of
the
labour
party
and
the
government
mr
blair
on

dismissed
claims
of
broken
promises
saying
ive
dealt
with
this
six
months
ago
i
said
then
you
dont
do
deals
over
jobs
like
this
you
dont
in
a
separate
bbc
interview
mr
brown
said
he
and
the
prime
minister
would
not
be
distracted
by
gossip
its
very
important
that
we
all
do
what
we
can
in
a
unified
way
to
ensure
the
election
of
a
labour
government
he
said
on
monday
mr
blairs
spokesman
said
the
prime
minister
is
determined
that
he
will
get
on
with
the
business
of
government
because
he
believes
that
what
people
want
mr
brown
says
he
discussed
the
election
campaign
with
mr
blair
on
saturday
and
promised
to
play
his
part
mr
peston
said
the
pair
had
mutual
animosity
and
contempt
mr
blair
had
decided
in
november
he
would
quit
because
he
felt
he
had
lost
voters
trust
because
of
the
iraq
war
he
had
then
changed
his
mind
in
june
following
intervention
from
cabinet
allies
and
suspicion
that
the
chancellor
was
manoeuvring
against
him
mr
brown
allegedly
said
he
could
no
longer
believe
anything
mr
blair
told
him
conservative
cochairman
liam
fox
likened
the
two
men
to
selfobsessed
schoolboys
liberal
democrat
parliamentary
chairman
matthew
taylor
said
their
personal
ambition
was
getting
in
the
way
of
good
government
exlabour
leader
neil
kinnock
said
mr
blair
and
mr
brown
could
only
deal
with
the
media
frenzy
by
continuing
to
say
they
would
not
allow
a
row
to
damage
labour
or
british
interests
he
told
bbc
radio
five
live
that
mr
brown
would
never
encourage
any
kind
of
insurrection
or
coup
