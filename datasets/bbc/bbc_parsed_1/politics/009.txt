aimed
at
bbc

later
contacted

and
that
it
was
all
a
silly
fuss
mr

the
day
after

warned
the
bbc
to
steer
away
from
demonising

blaming
him
for
controversy
over
its
campaign
posters
the
images
including
one
of
flying
pigs
and
another
of
what

michael
howard
as
fagin
prompted
accusations
of
antisemitism
claims
denied
by
labour
mr

was
apparently
intended
for
a
party

statement
in
it
he
said

to
standard

done
by
by

according
to
political
brief
now
fuck
off
and
cover
something
important
you
twats
the
email
was
sent
by
mistake
to
newsnight
journalist
andrew
mcfadyen
realising
his
error
mr
campbell
then
emailed
mr
mcfadyen
pointing
out
the
mistake
but
suggesting
presenter
jeremy
paxman
would
have
seen
the
funny
side
he
said
not
very
good
at
this
email
blackberry
malarkey
just
looked
at
log
of
sent
messages
have
realised
email
meant
for
colleagues
at
tbwa
has
gone
to
you
for
the
record
first
three
sentences
of
email
spot
on
no
row
between
me
and
trevor
posters
done
by
them
according
to
our
brief
i
dreamt
up
flying
pigs
pigs
not
great
but
okay
in
the
circs
of
tories
promising
tax
cuts
and
spending
rises
with
the
same
money
tbwa
made
production
campbell
swears
shock
final
sentence
of
earlier
email
probably
a
bit
colourful
and
personal
considering
we
have
never
actually
met
but
im
sure
you
share
the
same
sense
of
humour
as
your
star
presenter
mr
p
never
known
such
a
silly
fuss
since
the
last
silly
fuss
but
there
we
go
must
look
forward
not
back
later
the
prime
ministers
spokesman
was
asked
by
journalists
about
his
view
on
mr
campbells
use
of
abusive
language
the
spokesman
said
the
person
you
are
referring
to
is
capable
of
speaking
for
himself
and
he
no
longer
works
in
government
foreign
secretary
jack
straw
said
he
had
always
had
very
good
and
polite
relations
with
mr
campbell
who
he
described
as
very
talented
but
on
the
former
spin
doctors
use
of
language
mr
straw
said
i
do
know
the
odd
journalist
who
has
occasionally
used
the
odd
word
that
would
probably
be
inappropriate
in
some
circumstances
maybe
i
mix
with
the
wrong
kind
of
journalists
liam
fox
tory
cochairman
said
the
return
of
mr
campbell
was
a
sign
of
new
sinister
and
underhand
tactics
by
labour
