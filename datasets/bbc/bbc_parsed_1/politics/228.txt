labour
pig
poster
antisemitic
the
labour
party
has
been
accused
of
antisemitism
over
a
poster
depicting
michael
howard
and
oliver
letwin
who
are
both
jewish
as
flying
pigs
prospective
tory
candidate
andrew
mennear
whose
finchley
constituency
contains
a
large
jewish
community
branded
it
tasteless
and
offensive
the
poster
shows
the
two
mens
faces
superimposed
on
winged
pigs
and
says
the
day
the
tory
sums
add
up
labour
said
the
poster
was
not
antijewish
but
antitory
it
is
one
of
four
designs
emailed
to
labour
members
who
were
asked
to
vote
for
their
favourite
mr
mennear
who
was
sent
the
email
by
a
friend
said
he
had
been
shocked
by
the
image
and
had
shown
it
to
friends
who
were
similarly
horrified
he
said
there
was
nothing
more
distasteful
for
a
jewish
person
than
to
be
associated
with
a
pig
i
am
not
suggesting
there
is
any
deliberate
intent
but
these
sort
of
things
can
cause
great
offence
it
clearly
wasnt
thought
through
it
is
possible
the
posters
were
designed
for
maximum
impact
but
this
one
clearly
overstepped
the
mark
and
should
be
withdrawn
the
campaign
was
particularly
insensitive
as
it
had
come
out
at
the
same
time
as
holocaust
day
a
difficult
time
for
many
jewish
people
mr
mennear
added
a
labour
spokesman
denied
the
campaign
was
antisemitic
as
we
said
at
the
time
the
james
report
the
tory
backed
inquiry
into
possible
public
spending
savings
was
published
pigs
will
fly
before
the
torys
sums
will
add
up
this
poster
is
making
a
serious
point
he
said
a
conservative
party
spokesman
said
while
the
conservatives
are
concentrating
on
the
issues
that
matter
to
people
such
as
lower
taxes
and
controlled
immigration
it
is
clear
to
see
that
the
labour
party
is
not
people
will
not
be
fooled
