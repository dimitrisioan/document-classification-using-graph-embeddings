pension
plans
millions
of
public
service
workers
could
strike
if
ministers
scrap
their
final
salary
pension
scheme
and
make
them
work
longer
warn
union
leaders
the
cabinet
office
has
confirmed
it
is
reviewing
the
current
pension
system
prompting
unions
representing
m
workers
to
threaten
united
action
they
believe
the
plans
include
raising
the
mandatory
retirement
age
for
public
service
workers
from
to
the
government
says
unions
will
be
consulted
before
any
changes
are
made
it
is
thought
the
proposed
overhaul
due
on
thursday
could
mean
pensions
could
be
based
on
a
career
average
salary
for
each
year
served
staff
currently
get
one
eightieth
of
their
highest
salary
in
the
final
three
years
ministers
will
be
anxious
to
avoid
mass
strike
action
in
the
leadup
to
the
next
general
election
which
is
widely
expected
next
may
in
a
statement
on
sunday
the
cabinet
office
said
it
was
reviewing
the
civil
service
pension
scheme
and
hoped
to
announce
proposals
soon
unions
will
of
course
be
consulted
about
any
proposed
changes
public
sector
pension
schemes
need
to
remain
affordable
and
sustainable
people
are
living
longer
and
pensions
are
getting
more
expensive
to
maintain
the
longterm
affordability
of
our
pension
scheme
the
government
announced
in
its
green
paper
on
pensions
that
pension
age
would
rise
from
to
on
monday
tony
blairs
official
spokesman
declined
to
say
whether
the
prime
minister
backed
the
plans
he
said
whats
important
is
that
theres
a
process
going
on
its
out
for
consultation
at
the
moment
lets
wait
for
that
process
to
complete
itself
there
is
already
widespread
anger
over
the
chancellors
plans
to
get
rid
of
more
than
civil
servants
now
public
service
unions
are
united
against
the
plans
and
the
trades
union
congress
is
discussing
the
issue
next
monday
dave
prentis
general
secretary
of
unison
said
changes
to
pension
provisions
for
workers
in
the
public
sector
would
mean
they
had
to
pay
in
more
but
would
still
face
a
raw
deal
members
working
in
the
nhs
or
for
local
government
have
never
had
high
pay
or
city
bonuses
but
they
could
look
forward
to
a
decent
pension
now
all
that
is
being
taken
away
he
said
what
really
riles
me
is
the
breathtaking
hypocrisy
of
mps
who
recently
voted
themselves
the
best
pension
scheme
in
europe
but
say
they
cant
afford
it
for
anyone
else
this
is
a
position
that
unison
can
not
accept
and
will
oppose
it
will
lead
to
conflict
between
unison
and
the
government
if
not
this
year
then
next
mr
prentis
said
workers
did
not
want
to
go
on
strike
and
called
for
talks
between
unions
and
the
highest
level
of
government
mark
serwotka
from
the
public
and
commercial
services
union
said
there
should
be
a
coordinated
one
day
strike
unless
there
was
a
government
rethink
the
fire
brigades
union
said
the
government
was
planning
to
cut
ill
health
retirement
benefits
for
firefighters
and
other
measures
to
chip
away
at
pensions
pensions
officer
paul
woolstenholmes
said
the
pensions
of
millions
of
public
sector
workers
are
under
threat
apart
from
mps
and
judges
who
have
the
most
generous
pensions
arrangements
in
the
country
