plan
attacked
plans
to
allow
foreign
nuclear
waste
to
be
permanently
stored
in
the
uk
have
been
branded
deeply
irresponsible
by
the
liberal
democrats
the
government
has
confirmed
intermediate
level
waste
ilw
that
was
to
have
been
shipped
back
to
its
home
countries
will
now
be
stored
in
the
uk
the
cash
raised
will
go
towards
the
uks
nuclear
cleanup
programme
but
lib
dem
norman
baker
accused
ministers
of
turning
britain
into
a
nuclear
dumpsite
under
current
contracts
british
nuclear
fuels
should
return
all
but
low
level
waste
but
none
has
ever
been
sent
back
in
future
only
highlyradioactive
waste
will
be
sent
back
to
its
country
of
origin
normally
germany
or
japan
under
armed
guard
intermediate
waste
from
countries
such
as
japan
germany
spain
italy
switzerland
and
sweden
will
be
stored
permanently
in
the
uk
at
the
moment
this
waste
is
stored
at
sellafield
in
cumbria
in
the
form
of
glass
bricks
untreated
liquid
waste
or
solid
material
in
drums
in
a
statement
the
department
of
trade
and
industry
said
the
new
policy
meant
there
would
be
a
sixfold
reduction
in
the
number
of
waste
shipments
to
overseas
countries
and
it
said
highlyradioactive
waste
would
be
returned
to
its
home
country
sooner
ensuring
there
would
be
no
overall
increase
in
radioactivity
trade
secretary
patricia
hewitt
said
the
new
arrangements
revealed
in
a
commons
written
statement
would
raise
up
to
â£m
for
britains
nuclear
cleanup
programme
under
the
new
nuclear
decommissioning
agency
but
the
move
has
been
criticised
by
environmental
groups
and
the
liberal
democrats
mr
baker
the
lib
dem
environment
spokesman
said
i
have
been
warning
for
months
that
this
would
happen
and
raised
it
with
government
several
times
but
now
our
worst
fears
have
been
confirmed
once
again
britains
environmental
and
health
needs
are
being
ignored
in
policies
driven
by
the
treasury
and
dti
this
is
a
terrible
attempt
to
offload
some
of
the
â£bn
cost
of
cleaning
up
nuclear
sites
the
energy
act
was
supposed
to
help
britain
clean
up
but
in
order
to
pay
for
it
we
are
becoming
a
nuclear
dumpsite
the
nuclear
industry
is
an
economic
social
and
environmental
millstone
that
hangs
around
britains
neck
