the
memory
driving
browns
mission
the
memory
gordon
brown
says
keeps
returning
to
him
the
one
that
he
says
is
burnt
into
him
is
that
of
a
yearold
girl
whose
parents
died
of
aids
and
who
is
hiv
positive
herself
mr
brown
seems
haunted
by
her
eyes
desolate
of
all
hope
and
then
he
talks
of
those
eyes
that
do
inspire
optimism
an
extraordinary
performance
by
schoolgirls
of
kenyas
largest
slum
advancing
with
crowded
menace
flicking
their
hips
in
a
manner
almost
as
disturbing
before
the
finale
of
a
clenched
fist
salute
and
shout
of
free
education
free
education
for
all
mr
browns
message
generally
that
compassion
must
become
action
before
that
hope
is
squandered
but
he
is
such
a
pivotal
figure
in
british
politics
it
is
almost
impossible
not
to
ask
him
why
he
is
doing
this
his
answer
in
part
is
because
of
the
missionaries
that
used
to
come
to
his
fathers
church
ever
since
he
says
africa
has
been
important
to
him
ive
absolutely
no
doubt
whatsoever
this
is
heartfelt
but
he
also
believes
it
is
time
for
the
world
to
see
a
new
gordon
brown
not
the
dull
reassuring
bank
manager
but
a
man
driven
by
a
moral
passion
and
it
just
so
happens
the
labour
party
feels
an
awful
lot
happier
ridding
the
world
of
debt
than
ridding
the
world
of
dictators
theres
also
a
sense
of
liberation
if
mr
blair
wont
allow
him
to
run
the
election
campaign
then
he
can
at
least
pretend
it
was
all
getting
tedious
and
hed
much
rather
be
out
examining
social
problems
in
the
raw
it
also
goes
some
way
to
solving
one
of
the
overarching
problems
for
all
politicians
of
all
parties
scepticism
sliding
into
cynicism
about
politics
itself
if
he
can
help
the
worlds
poor
just
a
little
then
it
shows
politics
isnt
worthless
but
is
his
vision
for
africa
too
grand
can
poverty
in
the
continent
really
be
halved
brown
replies
that
no
one
thought
the
berlin
wall
would
ever
come
down
either
hes
still
got
to
overcome
not
only
the
reluctance
of
other
finance
ministers
in
the
world
but
also
the
cynicism
of
experts
who
wonder
whether
debt
relief
will
just
be
squandered
by
governments
that
just
wont
in
the
end
spend
wisely
