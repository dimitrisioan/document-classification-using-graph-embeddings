ukip
mep
attacked
german
empire
a
uk
independence
party
mep
suggested
germany
saw
the
eu
as
an
empire
and
was
cheaper
than
using
tanks
a
new
documentary
has
revealed
mike
nattrass
ukips
deputy
leader
made
the
comments
to
an
audience
at
a
meeting
during
last
septembers
hartlepool
byelection
campaign
but
challenged
on
the
remark
he
denied
accusing
germany
of
using
the
eu
as
cover
for
a
th
german
reich
he
says
he
was
not
germanbashing
but
saying
peace
was
the
eus
founding
aim
the
meeting
was
shown
in
a
bbc
film
on
exukip
mep
robert
kilroysilk
the
former
chat
show
host
quit
the
party
earlier
this
month
calling
it
a
joke
the
documentary
showed
mr
nattrass
apparently
talking
about
the
eu
telling
the
meeting
the
germans
are
the
big
losers
here
but
they
dont
care
because
to
them
the
project
is
worthwhile
its
like
an
empire
for
them
spreading
in
all
directions
away
from
germany
into
hungary
into
what
they
call
the
sudetenland
czechoslovakia
places
like
that
so
its
cheaper
for
them
to
do
it
this
way
than
roll
the
tanks
in
on
tuesday
he
told
the
bbc
news
website
he
did
not
think
the
comments
were
offensive
and
worked
happily
with
meps
of
different
nationalities
in
the
european
parliament
he
argued
that
peace
was
the
only
reason
for
having
the
outdated
eu
as
there
was
no
economic
justification
pointing
to
germanys
trade
interests
as
a
country
in
the
centre
of
europe
mr
nattrass
said
the
fact
is
that
the
eu
benefits
germany
but
it
does
not
benefit
britain
im
not
at
all
germanbashing
its
the
truth
a
ukip
spokesman
said
mike
has
some
passionate
beliefs
and
sometimes
uses
excessively
colourful
language
with
which
to
express
them
the
documentary
showed
some
of
the
tensions
between
mr
kilroysilk
and
his
fellow
meps
after
ukip
took
third
place
in
last
years
european
elections
he
denied
wanting
to
be
leader
until
october
when
he
told
bbc
ones
breakfast
with
frost
programme
he
aspired
to
the
job
asked
by
the
documentary
makers
why
he
had
lied
about
his
leadership
ambitions
mr
kilroysilk
said
there
was
one
thing
i
said
that
i
shouldnt
have
said
at
the
time
i
was
trying
to
be
helpful
to
the
party
and
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
do
i
should
have
told
the
truth
the
film
also
included
footage
of
a
row
between
mr
kilroysilk
mep
nigel
farage
and
party
leader
roger
knapman
about
rumours
that
he
was
about
to
resign
the
ukip
whip
in
the
european
parliament
mr
kilroysilk
told
them
he
had
not
left
the
ukip
group
a
move
he
announced
shortly
after
the
meeting
he
told
mr
farage
dont
tell
lies
nigel
now
youve
told
too
many
most
of
the
trouble
had
been
caused
by
you
ukip
officials
claim
it
was
in
fact
mr
kilroysilk
not
mr
farage
who
briefed
newspapers
he
was
leaving
the
group
of
meps
later
in
unguarded
offair
comments
in
a
television
studio
mr
kilroysilk
was
heard
saying
he
was
irritated
by
defending
some
of
these
rightwing
fascist
nutters
mr
kilroysilk
separately
said
he
had
argued
against
ukip
working
with
such
groups
which
believed
homosexuality
was
a
sin
a
ukip
spokesman
said
there
were
more
than
meps
in
the
same
group
in
the
european
parliament
they
were
from
a
broad
spectrum
some
rightwing
some
leftwing
but
with
a
shared
belief
in
the
unfeasibility
of
the
eu
as
it
is
now
he
did
not
defend
other
groups
religious
beliefs
but
argued
it
was
their
right
to
hold
such
views
just
as
mr
kilroysilk
had
a
right
to
criticise
arab
states
london
ukip
mep
gerard
batten
said
robert
has
made
a
variety
of
comments
about
ukip
and
its
meps
there
are
of
course
two
sides
to
every
story
what
robert
does
not
say
is
that
he
was
offered
several
positions
which
would
have
given
him
effective
control
of
the
party
but
not
the
title
of
leader
mr
kilroysilk
is
to
launch
his
own
parry
veritas
in
westminster
on
wednesday
