others
simply

they

the
audit
commission
found
the
whole
local
government
finance
system
was
fundamentally
flawed
and
all
three
of
the
main
parties
have
said
the
system
has
to
change
labour
says
it
wants
to
retain
the
propertybased
tax
but
reform
it
to
make
it
fairer
and
says
there
is
scope
for
councils
to
become
more
efficient
they
say
they
are
already
helping
pensioners
with
council
tax
bills
with
a

last

the

deputy
prime
minister
john
prescott
has
said
the
current

says
this

a

last

looked
at
increasing
the

other

of
local

such
as
reformed
business
rates

no

an

promised
a

on

for

who
they
say
have
been

by

in

they

by
an

it
would
not
be
means
tested
say
the
tories
because
that
would
create
more
bureaucracy
and
could
discourage
people
from
saving
for
their
retirement
instead
households
where
council
tax
payers
are
over
would
get
a

covering

the

also

they

altogether
and
switch

tax
of

norway
and
switzerland
the

would
be
set
locally
but

they
say
the
council

is
the
most

most
unfair
tax
in
britain
because
it

says
it
