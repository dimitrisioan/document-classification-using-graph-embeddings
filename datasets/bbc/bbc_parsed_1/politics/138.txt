had
no

also
expressed

that

the
european

of

had
qualified
the

the
nao
urged
the

in

it
said
member

needed
to
be
more
accountable
on
how
money
was
spent
the
report
said
member
states
still
do
not
report
fraud
and
other
irregularities
to
the
european
antifraud
office
on
a
consistent
basis
as
the
court
has
now
qualified
its
opinion
on
the
community
accounts
for
a
decade
it
is
essential
for
all
the
authorities
involved
to
contribute
to
the
strengthening
of
the
audit

revenue
and

and
improving
accountability

edward
leigh
chairman
of
the
commons
public
accounts
committee
said
britain
had
to
set
an
example
when
it
assumed
the
eu
presidency
any
fraud
in
other
member
states
is
potentially
fraud
against
the
uk
taxpayer
given
that
we
are
the
second
largest
net
contributor
to
the
community
he
said
departments
responsible
for
administering
eu
funds
need
to
make
sure
that
theyre
doing
everything
possible
to
weed
out
improper
spending
the
government
must
take
the
opportunity
afforded
by
the
uk
presidency
of
the
eu
to
press
the
commission
and
other
member
states
to
take
an
equally
robust
stance
against
fraud
and
irregularity
and
raise
overall
standards
of
financial
management
a
spokesman
for
the
european
antifraud
office
said
the
organisation
agreed
with
the
naos
assessment
of
fraud
reporting
the
quality
of
reporting
does
differ
from
member
state
to
member
state
and
there
is
room
for
improvement
spokesman
jorg
wojahn
said
he
added
that
there
is
generally
good
cooperation
with
member
states
and
the
antifraud
office
on
specific
cases
of
fraud
with
the
statistics
studied
by
nao
providing
a
good
overview
for
planning
strategic
ways
of
detecting
fraud
