david
blunkett
who
has
resigned
as
home
secretary
built
his
reputation
as
a
plainspeaking
yorkshire
man
i
fell
in
love
with
someone
and
they
wouldnt
go
public
and
things
started
to
go
very
badly
wrong
in
the
summer
and
then
the
news
of
the
world
picked
up
the
story
i
tried
for
three
years
to
make
something
work
trust
plainspeaking
and
straight
talking
is
something
which
matters
so
much
to
me
as
a
politician
and
as
a
man
that
i
have
decided
of
my
own
volition
to
request
an
independent
review
of
the
allegations
that
i
misused
my
position
i
dont
think
anyone
can
say
i
have
said
one
thing
in
public
and
done
another
in
private
it
would
be
dangerous
territory
if
i
wasnt
practising
what
i
preach
which
is
to
always
accept
responsibility
always
accept
the
consequences
of
your
actions
none
of
us
believe
countering
terrorism
is
about
party
politics
i
accepted
by
necessity
we
have
to
have
prevention
under
a
new
category
which
is
to
intervene
before
the
act
is
committed
rather
than
do
so
by
due
process
after
the
act
is
committed
when
its
too
late
he
said
in
reference
to
new
antiterrorism
measures
our
work
with
the
french
governmenthas
been
hugely
successful
said
mr
blunkett
the
number
of
illegal
immigrants
detected
in
dover
has
dropped
dramatically
strengthening
our
identity
is
one
way
or
reinforcing
peoples
confidence
and
sense
of
citizenship
and
wellbeing
i
foolishly
thought
as
this
was
a
celebrity
edition
it
would
be
more
relaxed
than
normal
you
wake
up
and
you
receive
a
phone
call
shipmans
topped
himself
you
have
just
got
to
think
for
a
minute
is
it
too
early
to
open
a
bottle
