style
talent
contest
for
wouldbe
politicians
finally
hits
our
screens
this
week
over
the
next
four
days
hundreds
of
potential
candidates
will
be
whittled
down
by
a
panel
of
experts
and
public
vote
the
winner
will
then
be
encouraged
to
stand
as
an
independent
at
the
next
general
election
which
is
expected
in
the
spring
but
opinion
is
divided
on
whether
any
of
the
potential
candidates
unearthed
so
far
have
got
what
it
takes
to
make
it
in
politics
any
of
them
would
make
competent
mps
former
independent
mp
martin
bell
insisted
on
bbc
radio
s
today
programme
mr
bell
who
will
be
offering
his
advice
to
the
contestants
on
wednesday
argues
that
westminster
has
its
share
of
odd
balls
and
the
show
will
engage
ordinary
voters
if
it
gets
more
people
voting
and
more
people
interested
in
politics
there
is
no
harm
in
that
he
said
but
sir
bernard
ingham
margaret
thatchers
former
press
secretary
took
a
less
charitable
view
accusing
the
programme
of
corrupting
politics
he
said
the
producers
would
not
achieve
their
aim
of
reengaging
voters
with
that
bunch
of
nutters
to
give
sir
bernard
his
dues
monday
evenings
opening
episode
did
attract
more
than
a
smattering
of
eccentrics
and
selfpublicists
among
those
chancing
their
arm
were
a
druid
priest
and
a
former
porn
star
who
insisted
on
removing
her
top
to
make
her
point
about
the
legalisation
of
brothels
among
the
more
eccentric
policy
proposals
was
a
public
holiday
on
bruce
forsyths
birthday
and
bill
oddie
for
prime
minister
the
show
follows
the
timehonoured
pop
idol
format
with
queues
of
nervous
hopefuls
and
a
panel
of
three
experts
judging
their
performance
the
contestants
were
given
seconds
to
present
their
manifestos
then
the
final
were
tested
on
their
lobbying
ability
they
were
then
crossexamined
by
the
panel
which
was
chaired
by
exitn
political
editor
john
sergeant
with
television
host
lorraine
kelly
taking
the
nicki
chapman
role
but
the
real
star
of
the
show
is
kelvin
mackenzie
in
the
simon
cowell
mr
nasty
seat
the
former
sun
editor
dispensed
a
stream
of
wellcrafted
insults
and
oneliners
his
advice
for
one
young
contestant
was
to
get
a
haircut
and
a
brain
transplant
wheelchair
user
kevin
donnellon
was
asked
why
on
earth
do
you
want
our
elected
representatives
to
be
disabled
dont
you
care
about
the
inuit
implored
guitartoting
environmental
campaigner
barry
lim
i
dont
care
about
them
i
care
about
myself
and
when
the
suns
shining
i
think
fantastic
replied
mr
mackenzie
mr
lim
later
reduced
the
panel
to
fits
of
giggles
as
he
outlined
his
plan
to
make
people
do
community
service
instead
of
paying
taxes
when
the
prime
minister
turns
to
the
chancellor
and
says
how
much
have
we
got
in
the
coffers
mr
brown
he
says
well
prime
minister
bad
news
all
the
houses
in
britain
have
been
painted
but
actually
nobody
has
paid
any
tax
observed
mr
mackenzie
that
was
an
total
disaster
i
just
couldnt
seem
to
think
of
things
to
say
a
crestfallen
mr
lim
confided
in
the
shows
presenter
jonathan
maitland
irfan
hanif
a
yearold
doctor
from
bolton
made
a
good
impression
even
if
he
was
a
little
thrown
by
mr
mackenzies
suggestion
that
instead
of
being
treated
by
the
nhs
young
drunks
should
given
a
good
beating
and
left
to
die
dominic
carman
son
of
late
libel
lawyer
george
carman
was
voted
through
to
the
final
on
a
platform
of
cutting
defence
spending
to
boost
education
opinion
was
more
divided
over
rodney
hyltonpotts
a
yearold
convicted
fraudster
mr
mackenzie
thought
the
smoothtalking
former
solicitor
with
a
hardline
on
crime
and
immigration
deserved
a
chance
to
progress
he
could
join
the
rest
of
the
crooks
in
the
houses
of
parliament
but
ms
kelly
said
she
would
not
trust
him
as
far
as
she
could
throw
him
the
series
continues
throughout
the
week
with
the
public
given
the
chance
to
evict
one
prospective
mp
every
night
itv
will
not
fund
the
election
campaign
for
the
eventual
winner
but
the
publicity
could
give
the
winner
a
flying
start
over
other
candidates
