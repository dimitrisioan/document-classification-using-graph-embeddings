euniversity
disgraceful
waste
a
failed
government
scheme
to
offer
uk
university
courses
online
has
been
branded
a
disgraceful
waste
by
mps
the
euniversity
was
scrapped
last
year
having
attracted
only
students
at
a
cost
of
â£m
chief
executive
john
beaumont
was
paid
a
bonus
of
â£
despite
a
failure
to
bring
in
private
sector
backers
the
commons
education
select
committee
called
this
morally
indefensible
but
the
government
said
the
euniversity
project
had
improved
understanding
a
department
for
education
and
skills
spokeswoman
said
the
venture
had
been
ambitious
and
groundbreaking
but
takeup
had
not
been
sufficient
to
continue
with
the
project
she
added
uk
euniversities
was
not
the
only
organisation
to
have
lost
out
on
private
sector
investment
in
the
collapse
of
the
dotcom
boom
the
select
committee
found
that
those
responsible
for
founding
the
euniversity
in
had
been
caught
up
in
the
general
atmosphere
of
enthusiasm
surrounding
the
internet
initial
business
plans
forecast
a
quarter
of
a
million
students
joining
within
a
decade
bringing
in
at
least
â£m
in
profit
but
virtually
no
market
research
was
carried
out
and
just
â£m
was
spent
on
worldwide
sales
and
marketing
of
courses
some
â£m
went
on
developing
the
technology
to
make
the
euniversity
work
this
was
used
by
just
students
the
rest
preferring
to
work
through
existing
university
websites
with
no
significant
private
investors
and
no
direct
accountability
to
a
government
minister
the
euniversity
had
had
too
much
freedom
to
spend
public
money
as
it
wished
the
report
found
committee
chairman
barry
sheerman
said
uk
euniversity
was
a
terrible
waste
of
public
money
the
senior
executives
failed
to
interest
any
private
investors
and
showed
an
extraordinary
overconfidence
in
their
ability
to
attract
students
to
the
scheme
the
report
warns
that
the
government
should
not
be
scared
off
investment
in
innovative
but
potentially
risky
schemes
by
the
failure
of
the
euniversity
but
should
learn
the
lessons
from
this
disaster
