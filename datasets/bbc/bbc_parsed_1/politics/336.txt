labours
core
support
takes
stock
tony
blair
has
told
labour
supporters
hes
back
and
still
hungry
for
the
job
of
prime
minister
but
does
that
sum
up
the
mood
at
the
partys
spring
conference
in
gateshead
the
electorate
are
keener
on
the
government
than
some
labour
party
members
is
the
dry
assessment
of
graham
lane
leader
of
the
labour
group
on
newham
council
the
problem
according
to
mr
lane
is
not
continuing
divisions
over
iraq
foundation
hospitals
or
tuition
fees
or
even
voter
apathy
but
mr
blair
himself
i
have
a
new
slogan
vote
blair
get
brown
thats
what
i
am
telling
people
on
the
doorstep
dont
worry
he
will
be
gone
soon
his
friend
saxon
spence
leader
of
devon
county
labour
group
lays
the
blame
for
any
lack
of
campaigning
zeal
on
one
issue
above
all
others
you
can
not
underestimate
the
impact
of
the
war
in
iraq
we
lost
people
from
our
local
party
who
had
some
key
roles
but
the
two
friends
were
fired
up
by
gordon
browns
speech
on
saturday
with
its
appeal
to
core
labour
values
on
social
justice
health
and
education
there
was
real
passion
i
think
we
have
all
felt
a
little
jaded
but
it
reminded
us
why
we
joined
the
party
in
the
first
place
said
mrs
spence
if
he
hadnt
have
walked
off
the
stage
they
would
still
be
clapping
added
mr
lane
but
for
every
brownite
at
the
spring
conference
there
was
an
equally
ardent
fan
of
mr
blair
stephen
douglas
from
wales
said
after
the
pms
speech
on
sunday
i
think
it
was
a
bit
of
a
turning
point
given
the
roasting
he
has
had
on
some
issues
the
guy
still
has
it
tony
martin
of
burnley
said
he
is
the
first
leader
who
has
won
us
two
terms
this
bloke
has
delivered
for
us
malcolm
shipley
of
shipley
said
it
was
as
if
he
is
coming
round
to
the
right
approach
again
katrina
bull
a
prospective
parliamentary
candidate
said
mr
blair
had
shown
he
could
rouse
the
partys
grassroots
i
think
if
every
voter
was
able
to
spend
time
in
a
room
with
tony
the
way
we
have
today
we
will
have
no
problem
with
turnout
she
had
just
emerged
from
a
qa
session
in
which
mr
blair
tieless
and
supremely
at
ease
answered
questions
posed
via
the
partys
website
a
party
of
councillors
from
nottingham
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
mr
blairs
leadership
and
they
were
adamant
that
the
campaigning
strength
of
the
party
in
their
city
was
as
strong
as
ever
iraq
they
insisted
would
not
be
a
factor
for
most
voters
the
biggest
problem
we
have
got
at
the
moment
is
that
we
keep
getting
all
these
polls
saying
we
are
going
to
run
away
with
the
election
it
might
sound
great
but
it
does
create
this
sense
of
complacency
among
our
own
voters
and
i
think
that
is
the
greater
problem
than
iraq
said
nottingham
city
councillor
brian
parbutt
and
even
mr
blairs
most
vocal
critics
seemed
to
agree
on
one
thing
he
is
a
master
of
the
sort
of
glossy
highprofile
campaigning
that
has
become
labours
hallmark
epitomised
by
fridays
whistlestop
tour
of
marginal
seats
a
group
of
shop
stewards
from
the
swan
hunter
shipyard
who
said
they
were
facing
redundancy
could
barely
suppress
their
anger
at
mr
blairs
failure
to
as
they
saw
it
shake
off
his
tory
leanings
and
stand
up
for
manufacturing
in
the
north
east
they
were
also
scathing
about
the
alleged
benefits
of
showpiece
projects
such
as
conference
venue
sage
centre
heralded
by
john
prescott
and
others
this
weekend
as
a
symbol
of
labours
success
in
urban
regeneration
it
is
no
good
having
the
sage
or
baltic
if
you
havent
got
the
money
for
the
entrance
fee
said
terry
telford
but
when
asked
about
mr
blairs
bravura
performance
on
friday
the
men
agreed
he
was
brilliant
and
they
would
all
be
out
on
the
doorstep
pushing
the
labour
message
come
election
time
if
you
are
not
fired
up
about
the
election
then
whats
the
point
there
is
no
complacency
as
far
as
i
can
see
in
the
labour
party
we
are
fired
up
we
are
up
for
this
election
said
richie
porterhouse
mr
telford
agreed
but
added
it
was
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
think
of
an
answer
when
people
asked
what
has
labour
done
for
the
north
east
i
have
had
doors
slammed
in
my
face
he
said
every
activist
i
spoke
to
said
they
were
proud
of
what
they
believed
labour
had
achieved
in
their
local
communities
the
new
hospitals
and
schools
the
better
life
chances
for
young
people
the
problem
they
faced
they
said
was
converting
this
local
feelgood
factor
into
votes
but
they
could
at
least
rely
on
one
secret
weapon
as
one
activist
put
it
tory
leader
michael
howard
