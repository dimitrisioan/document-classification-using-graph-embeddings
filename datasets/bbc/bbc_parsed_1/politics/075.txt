to
a
jewish
reporter
tory
mp
boris
johnson
has
insisted

also
claimed
tony

intervention
in
the
row
was
an
attempt
to
reassure
jewish
voters
london
mayor
mr
livingstone
says
he
is
standing
by
his
remarks
which
likened
an
evening
standard
journalist
to
a
concentration
camp
guard
but
the
prime
minister
says
it
is
time
for
mr
livingstone
to
say
sorry
labours
mr
livingstone
has
said
his
comments
may
have
been
offensive
but
were
not
racist
and
said
earlier
this
week
he
would
not
apologise
even
if
mr
blair
asked
later
the
prime
minister
said
a
lot
of
us
in
politics
get
angry
with
journalists
from
time
to
time
but
in
the
circumstances
and
to
the
journalist
because
he
was
a
jewish
journalist
yes
he
should
apologise
however
mr
johnson
who
was
forced
to
apologise
last
year
for
an
article
in
the
magazine
he
edits
about
liverpudlians
grieving
over
the
death
of
british
hostage
ken
bigley
said
mr
blair
should
butt
out
of
the
row
i
dont
see
why
the
prime
minister
has
to
get
involved
in
this
the
spectator
editor
told
bbc
radio
s
today
programme
its
a
dispute
between
ken
livingstone
and
a
reporter
on
the
evening
standard
mr
johnson
mp
for
henleyonthames
oxfordshire
said
he
suspected
labour
was
now
trying
to
reassure
jewish
voters
because
of
this
curious
way
in
which
labour
seems
to
be
trying
to
curry
favour
with
disillusioned
muslim
voters
who
may
be
disillusioned
about
the
war
ken
doesnt
think
hes
got
anything
to
say
sorry
for
and
if
thats
really
his
feeling
then
i
think
that
he
should
stick
to
his
guns
he
said
mr
johnson
apologised
last
october
for
perpetuating
an
outdated
stereotype
of
liverpool
in
the
leader
article
on
the
death
of
mr
bigley
the
article
in
the
magazine
suggested
grieving
liverpudlians
were
wallowing
in
their
victim
status
it
also
attributed
blame
to
drunken
liverpool
football
fans
for
the
hillsborough
disaster
in
which
died
mr
johnson
told
today
its
perfectly
true
that
i
got
into
the
grovelling
game
myself
and
when
i
apologised
there
were
some
things
that
i
felt
i
ought
to
say
sorry
for
there
were
also
other
things
i
didnt
think
i
should
apologise
for
he
said
but
heres
old
ken
hes
been
crass
hes
been
insensitive
and
thuggish
and
brutal
in
his
language
but
i
dont
think
actually
if
you
read
what
he
said
although
it
was
extraordinary
and
rude
i
dont
think
he
was
actually
antisemitic
