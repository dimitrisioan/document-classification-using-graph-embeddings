what
the
election
should
really
be
about
a
general
election
is
the
best
chance
most
pressure
groups
get
to
make
a
real
impact
on
government
policy
here
is
how
six
leading
lobbies
plan
to
make
sure
their
cause
is
being
debated
ahead
of
an
expected
spring
poll
weve
called
for
the
state
pension
to
be
increased
from
â£
to
the
pensioner
credit
guarantee
level
of
â£
thats
what
were
calling
for
many
pensioners
are
disadvantaged
by
the
current
system
if
weve
got
one
in
five
pensioners
below
the
poverty
line
weve
got
to
make
it
more
generous
or
have
these
people
living
in
poverty
weve
drawn
up
a
pensioners
manifesto
this
will
be
sent
to
each
of
the
candidates
in
the
constituencies
they
will
be
asked
which
of
the
top
five
issues
including
the
pension
issue
they
would
support
once
weve
got
their
responses
we
will
publish
the
results
within
the
constituencies
and
nationally
as
well
its
our
way
of
putting
the
politicians
on
notice
we
are
trying
to
get
across
the
fact
that
there
are
m
voters
over
in
the
country
they
are
more
likely
to
vote
than
other
sections
of
society
and
thirdly
they
are
true
swing
voters
before
most
pensioners
voted
conservative
in
and
they
voted
labour
but
there
is
no
guarantee
they
will
vote
for
a
labour
government
this
time
around
they
can
not
take
that
vote
for
granted
pensions
generally
will
certainly
be
a
big
election
issue
even
though
the
government
has
postponed
the
publication
of
adair
turners
full
report
into
the
issue
he
said
the
uk
had
one
of
the
least
generous
pensions
systems
in
the
developed
world
that
the
government
takes
seriously
the
impact
of
aviation
on
the
environment
we
havent
worked
out
specific
plans
but
i
imagine
we
will
lobby
political
parties
and
incumbent
mps
various
local
groups
will
do
that
in
their
particular
areas
and
we
will
provide
a
national
briefing
we
dont
have
any
large
demonstrations
planned
but
they
cant
be
ruled
out
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
we
will
be
successful
we
have
got
the
issue
in
the
public
consciousness
to
an
extent
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
an
election
will
raise
its
importance
in
the
public
mind
or
whether
it
will
be
pushed
out
by
big
issues
like
iraq
repealing
the
hunting
bill
we
are
challenging
the
use
of
the
parliament
act
in
a
high
court
action
we
are
hoping
to
hear
in
the
new
year
whichever
way
the
court
rules
the
other
side
will
appeal
so
we
expect
it
to
fall
plumb
in
electioneering
time
when
the
ban
comes
into
force
on
february
we
will
be
going
to
the
european
court
because
no
compensation
is
being
paid
so
theres
a
lot
of
legal
territory
to
go
we
are
trying
to
engage
with
the
ministers
by
demonstrating
and
talking
whatever
intelligence
we
get
we
will
try
to
turn
up
and
speak
to
whoever
it
is
rural
affairs
minister
alun
michael
has
avoided
us
and
cancelled
engagements
so
that
makes
it
difficult
it
is
not
intimidatory
on
the
whole
it
is
groups
of
angry
housewives
of
course
there
is
an
element
of
shouting
because
people
are
angry
but
there
is
no
violence
because
that
does
not
achieve
anything
it
will
fall
plumb
in
the
run
up
to
the
most
important
general
election
tony
blair
will
ever
face
its
exactly
what
the
prime
minister
did
not
want
he
wanted
the
issue
off
the
table
until
after
the
election
people
using
live
animals
as
targets
for
sport
both
here
and
abroad
the
reason
for
including
abroad
is
because
of
trophy
hunting
it
is
another
sort
of
form
of
shooting
for
sport
the
principle
is
the
same
whether
its
a
tiger
or
a
pheasant
we
will
widely
publicise
whats
happening
in
relation
to
trophy
hunting
we
will
publicise
the
darker
aspects
of
the
target
animal
industry
the
uk
we
will
seek
to
get
pledges
from
individual
mps
and
wouldbe
mps
saying
that
they
are
against
the
use
of
animals
as
targets
for
sports
we
would
like
the
support
of
political
parties
but
i
think
a
general
election
is
very
much
to
do
with
pledges
mps
make
to
their
electors
with
hunting
we
had
many
mps
who
were
happy
to
say
they
were
against
it
i
think
what
we
will
get
is
a
very
real
climbing
up
the
agenda
whether
or
not
we
will
get
a
ban
i
am
not
sure
but
it
will
mobilise
public
opinion
everything
we
do
will
reduce
animal
suffering
and
in
time
that
will
lead
to
a
ban
the
issue
that
we
think
is
the
most
important
for
this
election
is
choice
the
language
of
consumerism
is
very
commonplace
in
government
and
across
the
political
spectrum
choice
as
an
ideology
is
beginning
to
be
the
privatisation
of
this
decade
its
become
an
issue
in
itself
but
whats
really
missing
from
the
debate
is
the
consumers
choice
in
that
choice
is
not
choice
at
all
if
all
you
have
to
choose
from
is
two
failing
schools
we
have
seen
so
many
pensions
misselling
scandals
and
in
the
pensions
industry
theres
a
maximum
of
choice
but
a
minimum
quality
in
that
we
want
choice
on
the
consumers
terms
that
means
clear
and
accessible
information
to
operate
that
choice
firstly
we
have
our
website
it
features
our
campaigns
and
changes
every
day
secondly
through
our
members
who
communicate
with
us
thirdly
through
the
media
and
also
what
we
will
be
doing
is
holding
a
preelection
conference
we
will
invite
the
opinion
formers
mps
journalists
and
others
the
idea
is
that
we
open
up
communications
between
members
of
the
public
and
the
politicians
i
think
we
will
be
successful
its
very
much
the
language
being
used
by
the
main
political
parties
politicians
on
all
sides
are
very
sensitive
to
this
issue
they
want
to
be
seen
to
be
responding
to
this
issue
fuel
duty
is
a
large
part
of
operational
costs
for
road
haulage
workers
we
have
been
hearing
about
this
proposed
increase
of
p
per
litre
that
gordon
brown
has
been
postponing
and
postponing
tuppence
does
not
sound
like
a
great
deal
but
every
year
if
you
operate
one
vehicle
thats
an
increase
of
about
â£
if
youre
running
vehicles
its
obviously
times
that
if
fuel
duty
does
rise
we
will
be
absolutely
horrified
there
will
be
a
huge
effect
throughout
the
industry
and
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
you
see
widespread
demonstrations
what
it
will
mean
is
there
will
be
a
number
of
firms
going
out
of
business
we
will
continue
to
do
what
we
have
always
done
we
keep
the
issue
in
the
trade
press
regrettably
its
one
of
those
stories
that
it
is
getting
harder
to
get
into
the
national
press
whatever
we
do
the
public
dont
like
lorries
they
see
us
as
a
complaining
minority
but
they
dont
realise
that
when
you
see
a
car
on
the
road
it
is
probably
going
to
work
when
you
see
a
lorry
its
already
at
work
