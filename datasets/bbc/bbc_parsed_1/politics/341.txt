dem
leader
charles
kennedy
has
said
voters
now
have
a
fundamental
lack
of
trust
of
tony
blair
as
prime
minister
he
said
backing
his
party
was
not
a
wasted
vote
adding
that
with
the
lib
dems
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
he
made
his
comments
at
the
start
of
a
day
of
appearances
on
channel
five
in
a
session
on
the
wright
stuff
programme
questions
from
callers
a
studio
audience
and
the
shows
presenter
covered
lib
dem
tax
plans
antiterror
laws
and
immigration
mr
kennedy
said
during
his
nearly
years
in
parliament
he
had
seen
prime
ministers
and
party
leaders
come
and
go
and
knew
the
pitfalls
of
british
politics
was
when
i
was
first
elected
as
an
mp
so
tony
blair
michael
howard
and
myself
were
all
class
of
and
over
that
nearly
quarter
of
a
century
the
world
has
changed
out
of
recognition
he
said
we
dont
actually
hear
the
argument
any
longer
lib
dems
good
people
reasonable
ideas
but
only
if
we
thought
they
could
win
around
here
its
a
wasted
vote
you
dont
hear
that
because
the
evidence
of
peoples
senses
demonstrates
that
it
isnt
a
wasted
vote
but
he
said
mr
blair
had
lost
the
trust
of
the
british
people
there
is
a
fundamental
lack
of
trust
in
tony
blair
as
prime
minister
and
in
his
government
he
said
what
weve
got
to
do
as
a
party
what
ive
got
to
do
as
a
leader
of
this
party
is
to
convey
to
people
that
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
mr
kennedy
also
used
his
tv
appearance
to
defend
his
partys
plans
to
increase
income
tax
to
for
those
earning
more
than
â£
saying
it
would
apply
to
just
of
the
population
he
said
the
extra
revenue
would
allow
his
party
to
get
rid
of
tuition
and
topup
fees
introduce
free
personal
care
for
the
elderly
and
replace
the
council
tax
with
a
local
income
tax
mr
blair
has
already
spent
a
day
with
five
and
michael
howard
is
booked
for
a
similar
session
