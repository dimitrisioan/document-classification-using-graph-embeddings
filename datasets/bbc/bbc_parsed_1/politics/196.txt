chief
alastair

peter
mandelson
has
said
the
european
commissioner
and
former
labour
minister
was
speaking
amid
claims
that
mr
campbell
is
part
of
a
labour
dirty
tricks
campaign
that
charge
was
denied
by
mr
mandelson
who
said
the
tories
were
afraid
of
mr
campbells
campaigning
skills
he
warned
the
bbc
that
attacking
mr
campbell
had
brought
it
trouble
before
that
was
a
reference
to
the
hutton
inquiry
following

labour
has
attracted
media
criticism
for
using
new
freedom
of
information
laws
to
dig
up
information
about
tory
leader
michael
howards
past
mr
mandelson
a
former
labour
communications
director
told
bbc
radio
s
today
programme
i
understand
why
the
tories
will
be
gunning
for
alastair
campbell
because
they
fear
his
campaigning
skills
what
i
understand
less
is
why
the
bbc
should
be
joining
with
the
tories
in
driving
that
agenda
in
my
experience
of
these
things
parties
which
shout
about
dirty
tricks
and
the
like
tend
to
do
so
because
they
fear
a
direct
hit
in
some
vulnerable
part
of
their
political
anatomy
i
suggest
the
bbc
concentrates
on
the
issues
and
helps
the
public
to
understand
the
policies
and
the
choices
that
are
at
stake
in
the
election
rather
than
engages
in
the
process
politics
the
trivialisation
of
the
campaign
i
think
the
bbc
would
be
much
better
advised
to
leave
all
this
stuff
well
alone
concentrate
on
the
issues
as
i
say
not
resume
their
demonisation
of
alastair
campbell
we
all
know
where
that
led
before
mr
campbell
is
acting
as
an
adviser
for
labour
which
denies
engaging
in
personal
campaigning
conservative
cochairman
liam
fox
said
mr
campbells
return
and
labour
poster
plans
attacking
mr
howard
recently
withdrawn
from
the
partys
website
were
a
sign
of
abusive
politics
the
government
despite
the
fact
that
they
would
say
want
to
go
forward
not
back
seem
intent
on
talking
about
history
rather
than
their
own
record
or
even
more
importantly
about
the
future
he
said
on
sunday
labour
peer
baroness
kennedy
who
is
chairing
the
power
inquiry
into
political
disengagement
said
people
already
thought
politicians
engaged
in
dirty
tricks
this
feeling
of
distrust
is
going
to
be
enlarged
if
this
campaigning
on
all
sides
is
conducted
in
the
way
that
it
looks
as
if
it
just
might
