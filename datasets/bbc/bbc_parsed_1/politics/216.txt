ministers
naive
over
phonetaps
the
government
is
being
naive
by
refusing
to
allow
phonetap
evidence
in
court
a
senior
eu
politician
says
javier
solana
eu
foreign
policy
chief
says
phonetap
evidence
works
in
the
courts
of
other
european
countries
human
rights
groups
top
police
officers
and
many
mps
say
allowing
the
evidence
would
remove
the
need
to
detain
terror
suspects
without
charge
but
home
secretary
charles
clarke
says
the
evidence
would
not
make
much
difference
to
these
cases
mr
solana
told
itvs
jonathan
dimbleby
programme
phonetap
evidence
in
court
works
it
is
normal
that
it
is
done
it
would
be
naive
not
to
do
it
it
would
be
naive
not
to
use
this
technological
thing
that
we
have
at
our
disposal
mr
solanas
comments
come
the
day
after
sir
ian
blair
the
newlyappointed
metropolitan
police
commissioner
said
he
was
in
favour
of
phonetap
evidence
under
the
antiterrorism
crimes
and
security
act
foreign
terror
suspects
can
be
detained
in
british
jails
without
trial
or
charge
several
suspects
have
been
detained
under
these
powers
because
evidence
against
them
was
deemed
too
sensitive
to
be
heard
in
court
some
of
this
evidence
is
believed
to
be
telephone
intercepts
human
rights
group
liberty
has
argued
that
if
intercept
evidence
could
be
heard
these
detainees
could
be
brought
to
trial
but
critics
of
phonetap
trials
say
the
evidence
is
often
weak
and
can
expose
the
methods
of
the
security
services
the
home
secretary
says
intercepts
would
not
make
much
difference
because
cases
against
terror
suspects
frequently
rely
on
other
kinds
of
surveillance
but
mr
clarke
has
been
forced
to
change
the
regime
of
detention
without
trial
after
law
lords
ruled
it
illegal
he
has
opted
for
a
system
of
control
orders
whereby
suspects
both
british
and
foreign
can
be
held
under
house
arrest
or
surveillance
these
orders
will
again
involve
a
uk
optout
of
parts
of
the
european
convention
on
human
rights
while
accepting
that
people
have
to
be
prepared
for
a
possible
terrorist
attack
mr
solana
said
he
had
qualms
about
the
home
secretarys
new
plans
we
have
to
fight
terrorism
with
all
our
means
but
not
so
far
as
to
change
our
way
of
life
he
said
