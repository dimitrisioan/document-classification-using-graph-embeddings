abortion
not
a
poll
issue
blair
tony
blair
does
not
believe
abortion
should
be
an
election
issue
arguing
it
is
a
matter
for
individual
conscience
the
prime
ministers
spokesman
set
out
mr
blairs
view
after
the
top
catholic
in
england
and
wales
backed
michael
howards
stance
on
abortions
the
tory
leader
supports
a
reduction
in
the
legal
limit
from
weeks
to
and
has
said
current
rules
are
tantamount
to
abortion
on
demand
the
prime
minister
has
made
it
clear
he
has
no
plans
to
the
change
the
law
mr
blairs
spokesman
said
the
catholic
church
has
a
wellknown
position
on
this
issue
and
it
was
one
of
many
issues
the
cardinal
mentioned
and
therefore
it
should
be
seen
in
that
context
his
words
came
as
cardinal
cormac
murphy
oconnor
the
archbishop
of
westminster
backed
mr
howards
stance
and
distanced
himself
from
labour
in
a
statement
he
said
abortion
was
a
very
key
issue
saying
the
policy
supported
by
mr
howard
is
one
that
we
would
commend
on
the
way
to
a
full
abandonment
of
abortion
cardinal
oconnor
claimed
labour
had
developed
the
notion
that
it
was
the
natural
party
of
catholics
but
he
said
we
are
not
going
to
suggest
people
support
one
particular
party
the
family
planning
association
says
a
reduction
would
particularly
affect
young
women
who
often
seek
help
later
more
than
women
in
england
and
wales
had
terminations
last
year
of
which
fewer
than
were
carried
out
between
and
weeks
in
the
cosmopolitan
interview
mr
howard
said
i
believe
abortion
should
be
available
to
everyone
but
the
law
should
be
changed
in
the
past
i
voted
for
a
restriction
to
weeks
and
i
would
be
prepared
to
go
down
to
all
three
main
parties
say
the
issue
is
one
for
each
mps
conscience
rather
than
one
where
there
is
a
partywide
policy
mr
howard
stressed
his
views
were
his
personal
views
shadow
home
secretary
david
davis
said
he
understood
mr
howard
had
been
signalling
that
a
conservative
government
would
allow
a
commons
vote
on
the
issue
mr
blair
and
liberal
democrat
leader
charles
kennedy
also
gave
their
views
during
interviews
conducted
as
part
of
the
magazines
high
heeled
vote
campaign
mr
blair
who
last
year
denied
he
planned
to
join
his
wife
and
four
children
in
the
catholic
faith
despite
regularly
taking
communion
said
abortion
was
a
difficult
issue
however
much
i
dislike
the
idea
of
abortion
you
should
not
criminalise
a
woman
who
in
very
difficult
circumstances
makes
that
choice
obviously
there
is
a
time
beyond
which
you
cant
have
an
abortion
and
we
have
no
plans
to
change
that
although
the
debate
will
continue
mr
kennedy
said
he
had
previously
voted
for
a
week
limit
but
medical
advances
mean
i
dont
know
what
i
would
do
now
the
roman
catholic
archbishop
of
cardiff
the
most
reverend
peter
smith
told
bbc
radio
s
today
programme
that
the
church
merely
wanted
people
to
reflect
on
issues
in
light
of
the
gospel
before
voting
anne
weyman
chief
executive
of
the
family
planning
association
asked
what
is
the
benefit
to
women
or
to
the
potential
child
of
forcing
a
woman
to
have
a
baby
antiabortion
group
the
prolife
alliance
congratulated
mr
howard
on
his
new
stance
but
said
it
did
not
go
far
enough
