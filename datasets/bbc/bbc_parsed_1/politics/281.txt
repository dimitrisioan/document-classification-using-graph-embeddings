quits
shameful
ukip
exchat
show
host
robert
kilroysilk
has
quit
the
uk
independence
party
and
accused
it
of
betraying
its
supporters
the
mep
said
he
was
ashamed
to
have
joined
the
party
which
he
labelled
as
a
joke
he
plans
to
stand
in
the
next
general
election
but
refused
to
confirm
he
is
setting
up
a
new
political
party
called
veritas
latin
for
truth
ukip
leader
roger
knapman
said
he
would
break
open
the
champagne
adding
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
however
he
did
say
the
exchat
show
host
had
been
quite
useful
initially
he
has
remarkable
ability
to
influence
people
but
sadly
after
the
european
election
it
became
clear
that
he
was
more
interested
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
party
than
the
uk
independence
party
so
it
was
nice
knowing
him
now
goodbye
mr
knapman
told
bbc
radio
s
today
programme
mr
knapman
rejected
the
idea
mr
kilroysilk
posed
a
threat
to
ukip
and
queried
why
he
had
failed
to
confirm
rumours
he
was
starting
a
new
political
party
mr
kilroysilk
explained
his
reasons
to
his
east
midlands
constituents
at
a
meeting
in
hinckley
leicestershire
his
decision
came
as
ukip
officials
began
a
process
which
could
have
triggered
mr
kilroysilks
expulsion
it
marks
the
end
of
his
membership
of
ukip
after
just
nine
months
it
began
with
a
flood
of
publicity
which
helped
ukip
into
third
place
in
last
junes
european
elections
but
became
dominated
by
rancour
as
he
tried
to
take
over
the
party
leadership
mr
kilroysilk
accused
his
fellow
ukip
meps
of
being
content
with
growing
fat
sitting
on
their
backsides
in
brussels
he
told
bbc
news
i
tried
to
change
the
party
i
nagged
all
the
way
through
the
summer
to
do
things
to
get
moving
because
i
thought
it
was
criminal
what
they
were
doing
it
was
a
betrayal
mr
kilroysilk
also
told
sky
news
there
was
masses
of
support
for
him
to
form
a
new
party
something
he
has
yet
to
confirm
will
happen
ukip
won
seats
and
of
the
vote
at
the
european
elections
on
the
back
of
its
call
for
the
uk
to
leave
the
european
union
in
his
speech
mr
kilroysilk
says
the
result
offered
ukip
an
amazing
opportunity
but
the
partys
leadership
had
done
nothing
and
gone
awol
there
were
no
policies
no
energy
no
vision
and
no
spokespeople
he
said
the
party
is
going
nowhere
and
im
embarrassed
with
its
allies
in
europe
and
im
ashamed
to
be
a
member
of
the
party
said
mr
kilroysilk
he
said
his
conviction
in
britains
right
to
govern
itself
had
not
changed
he
would
continue
that
campaign
outside
ukip
when
he
contested
the
general
election
in
an
east
midlands
constituency
reports
of
his
new
party
plans
have
prompted
a
formal
complaint
to
ukips
disciplinary
committee
for
bringing
the
party
into
disrepute
on
thursday
the
party
challenged
mr
kilroysilk
to
stand
down
as
an
mep
so
voters
can
get
a
genuine
ukip
candidate
