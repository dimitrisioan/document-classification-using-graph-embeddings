told

weve
long
urged
them
to
go
drag
hunting
to
follow
an
artificial
scent
and
that
is
what
we
hope
they
do
but
if
they
continue
to
chase
foxes
to
chase
wild
mammals
around
the
countryside
thats
against
the
law
and
were
confident
theyll
be
brought
to
justice

optimism
that

would
be
able
to
continue
farmer
geoff
brooks
a
senior
member
of
the
quorn
hunt
told
bbc
news
peoples
lives
revolved
around
hunting
he
described
the
ban
as
ridiculous
and
badly
thought
out
but
said
it
would
be
hard
for
most
people
to
defy
it
as
they
would
not
want
to
risk
their
incomes
by
getting
a
criminal
record
at
the
court
of
appeal
on
wednesday
the
countryside
alliance
failed
in
its
attempt
to
have
the
hunting
act
ruled
invalid
but
it
says
the
ban
is
unenforceable
because
the
law
is
unclear
and
impossible
to
police
the
alliance
says
hunt
supporters
will
go
out
and
test
this
law
to
its
limits
on
saturday

against
cruel
sports
and
the
rspca
say
they
will
monitor
hunts
and
assist

in
bringing
prosecutions
the
association
of
chief
police
officers
has
issued
guidance
to
forces
on
how
to
deal
with
the
new
rules
a
spokesman
said
basically
its
not
going
to
be
police
officers
chasing
about
in
cars
across
fields
it
will
be
based
on
intelligence
and
information
received
as
well
the
decision
on
how
to
police
individual
hunts
will
be
left
to
local
forces
with
more
officers
sent
to
hunts
where
disruption
is
expected
he
said
police
would
consider
evidence
submitted
by
antihunt
organisations
on
its
merits
