aids

has

a
â£bn
bn
plan
to
fight
the
aids
epidemic
and
find
a
vaccine
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
sixday
tour
of

the
uk

predicted
a
vaccine
could
be
found
by
if
the
world
stepped
up
its
funding
pledges
doubling
the
â£m
being
spent
yearly
on
finding
such
a
vaccine
could
advance
it
by
three
years
and
save
six
million
lives
mr
brown
said
on
thursday
he
hopes
to
use
the
uks
g
presidency
to
push
the
issue
forward
i
believe
that
the
generation
that
provided
the
finance
to
combat
cure
and
eradicate
the
worlds
deadliest
disease
of
today
and
today
the
worlds
least
curable
disease
hivaids
will
rightly
earn
the
title
the
great
generation
mr
brown
said
in
a
speech
during
his
african
tour
the
problems
of
hivaids
were
inseparable
from
poverty
he
added
at
least
billion
per
annum
â£bn
is
needed
to
address
the
hivaids
crisis
in
low
and
middle
income
countries
existing
financial
commitments
on
their
own
will
not
stop
the
pandemic
the
uks
proposal
for
an
international
finance
facility
is
so
important
increasing
world
aid
flows
by
over
billion
â£bn
a
doubling
of
world
aid
to
halve
world
poverty
mr
brown
also
said
he
had
agreed
with
the
italian
finance
minister
domenico
siniscalco
to
push
forward
with
plans
for
the
worldwide
sharing
and
coordination
of
research
into
the
disease
currently
the
private
sector
was
only
spending
â£m
a
year
on
seeking
an
inoculation
and
the
market
needed
boosting
mr
brown
said
he
called
on
industrialised
nations
to
commit
themselves
to
buying
the
first
m
vaccines
at
a
cost
of
each
thereby
boosting
the
market
for
inoculations
this
would
be
a
large
enough
inducement
to
create
much
stronger
interest
from
both
large
and
small
pharmaceutical
firms
mr
brown
added
more
must
also
be
done
to
finance
the
treatment
and
care
of
those
living
with
hivaids
and
their
families
he
said
but
aid
charity
actionaid
criticised
mr
browns
preoccupation
with
finding
a
vaccine
and
called
on
g
nations
to
fund
hivaids
treatments
the
charitys
head
of
hivaids
in
britain
simon
wright
said
while
encouraging
the
pharmaceutical
industry
to
discover
an
hiv
vaccine
is
important
a
failure
to
provide
any
funding
for
hiv
treatments
condemns
a
generation
of
people
to
death
hiv
is
decimating
african
countries
killing
the
most
productive
adults
who
should
be
working
caring
for
children
and
building
the
economy
an
hiv
vaccine
is
probably
at
least
years
away
treatments
are
needed
now
on
wednesday
mr
brown
visited
slums
in
the
kenyan
capital
nairobi
he
will
visit
an
hivaids
orphanage
in
tanzania
and
a
womens
credit
union
in
mozambique
before
chairing
a
meeting
of
the
commission
for
africa
in
cape
town
the
chancellor
has
already
unveiled
proposals
for
a
g
aid
package
which
he
has
likened
to
the
marshall
plan
used
by
the
united
states
to
rebuild
europe
after
world
war
two
