says
it
is
in
talks
to
buy
the
former
assets
of
troubled
russian
crude
producer
yukos
we
are
in
touch
with
the
concerned
russian
entities
about
the
yukos
assets
and
other
opportunities
in
russia
said
ongc

subir

local
press
had
reported
that
ongc
was
looking
to
buy
of
yukos
former
key

â£bn
yukos
is
being
broken
up
by
russian
authorities
to
pay
a
massive
tax
bill
it
was
forced
to
sell
its
key

unit
yuganskneftegas
yugansk
last
month
after
being
hit
with
a
bill
of
bn
in
unpaid

stateowned
rosneft
now
owns
yugansk
and
russia
has
said
it
will
turn
the
oil
producer
into
a
standalone
firm
indian
oil
minister
mani
shankar
aiyar
discussed
ongcs
plans
during
a
trip
to
moscow
last
year
and
the
topic
came
up
again
during
russian
president
vladimir
putins
recent
visit
to
new
delhi
it
would
make
great
sense
for
us
to
build
on
that
said
mr
aiyar
indias
oil
production
has
stagnated
over
recent
years
and
it
is
having
to
look
abroad
to
secure
future
supplies
india
imports
about
of
its
total
oil
consumption
at
the
same
time
indias
economy
is
booming
and
the
countrys
thirst
for
oil
is
so
strong
that
it
has
helped
pushed
up
the
price
of
crude
worldwide
india
produces
about
barrels
of
oil
per
day
bpd
little
changed
since
the
start
of
the
s
according
to
oil
industry
analysts
douglaswestwood
consumption
meanwhile
has
jumped
to
million
bpd
compared
with
bpd
in
for
countries
to
develop
they
have
to
have
access
to
energy
said
john
westwood
managing
director
of
oil
industry
analysts
douglaswestwood
india
is
a
dramatically
growing
economy
that
must
have
access
to
oil
by
buying
into
yugansk
ongc
would
be
able
to
reduce
its
dependence
on
gulf
states
for
oil
imports
mr
westwood
explained
especially
as
the
chances
of
finding
and
exploiting
resources
within
india
are
slim
we
forecast
that
indian
production
will
go
into
significant
decline
mr
westwood
said
by
production
may
only
be
at
half
of
todays
levels
ongc
which
is
majorityowned
by
the
indian
state
already
has
bought
petroleum
assets
in
countries
including
vietnam
sudan
and
russia
the
company
is
a
partner
with
rosneft
in
the
sakhalin
oil
field
off
russias
siberian
coast
ongc
is
however
not
the
only
firm
interested
in
yugansk
chinese
crude
company
china
national
petroleum
has
also
been
mentioned
as
a
possible
investor
while
on
thursday
italy
refused
to
rule
out
an
interest
ongcs
interest
is
the
latest
twist
in
a
saga
that
has
seen
one
of
the
worlds
biggest
oil
producers
brought
to
its
knees
the
dispute
is
partly
driven
by
president
putins
clampdown
on
the
political
ambitions
of
exyukos
boss
mikhail
khodorkovsky
who
is
currently
in
jail
on
charges
of
fraud
and
tax
evasion
yukos
has
been
battling
the
russian
authorities
for
more
than
a
year
and
has
filed
for
bankruptcy
protection
in
the
us
analysts
have
questioned
how
long
it
can
continue
to
survive
without
yugansk
on
thursday
a
us
court
said
it
will
hear
arguments
for
yukos
bankruptcy
claim
to
be
thrown
out
on
february
should
that
happen
yukos
will
have
little
chance
of
clawing
back
its
assets
