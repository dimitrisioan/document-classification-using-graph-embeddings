recent
housing
market
surveys
have
indicated

cooled
in

months
after
several
years
of
rapid
growth
last

indicated
that
the
popularity
of
buytolet
mortgages
a
key
phenomenon
of
the
housing
boom
could
be
waning

said
that
while
rates

moderating
the

considerably

of
the

strong

rates
and
unemployment
are
both
likely
to
remain
at
historically
low
levels
real

of

with
the

helped
by
buoyant

wimpey
said
the
uk
housing
market
had
proved
challenging
last
year
by
late
summer
the
market
in

had
slowed
sharply
across
the
country
and
showed
no
real
improvement
during
the
autumn
it
added
however
the
first
seven
weeks
of
this
year
had
produced
promising
signs
wimpey
said
visitor
levels
and
interest
in

have
been
