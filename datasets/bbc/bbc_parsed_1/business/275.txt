five
million
germans
out
of
work
germanys
unemployment
figure
rose
above
the
psychologically
important
level
of
five
million
last
month
on
wednesday
the
german
federal
labour
agency
said
the
jobless
total
had
reached
million
in
january
which
takes
the
jobless
rate
to
yes
we
have
effectively
more
than
five
million
people
unemployed
a
government
minister
said
earlier
on
zdf
public
television
unemployment
has
not
been
this
high
in
germany
since
the
s
changes
to
the
way
the
statistics
are
compiled
partly
explain
the
jump
of
in
the
numbers
but
the
figures
are
embarrassing
for
the
government
with
the
figures
apparently
the
worst
weve
seen
in
the
postwar
period
these
numbers
are
very
charged
politically
said
christian
jasperneite
an
economist
with
mm
warburg
they
could
well
put
an
end
to
the
recent
renaissance
weve
seen
by
the
spd
the
ruling
social
democrats
in
the
polls
and
with
state
elections
due
in
schleswigholstein
and
north
rhinewestphalia
they
may
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
governments
chances
there
the
opposition
also
made
political
capital
from
the
figures
it
said
there
are
a
further
million
million
people
on
subsidised
employment
schemes
who
are
in
fact
looking
for
real
jobs
it
added
that
government
reforms
including
unpopular
benefit
cuts
do
not
go
far
enough
under
the
governments
controversial
hartz
iv
reforms
which
came
into
effect
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
both
those
on
unemployment
benefits
and
welfare
support
and
those
who
are
longterm
unemployed
are
officially
classified
as
looking
for
work
the
bad
winter
weather
also
took
its
toll
as
key
sectors
such
as
the
construction
sector
laid
off
workers
adjusted
for
the
seasonal
factors
the
german
jobless
total
rose
by
in
january
from
december
