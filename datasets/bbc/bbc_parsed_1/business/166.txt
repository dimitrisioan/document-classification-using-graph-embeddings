link
to
get
goahead
the
â£bn
crossrail
transport
plan
backed
by
business
groups
is
to
get
the
goahead
this
month
according
to
the
mail
on
sunday
it
says
the
uk
treasury
has
allocated
â£bn
bn
for
the
project
and
that
talks
with
business
groups
on
raising
the
rest
will
begin
shortly
the
much
delayed
crossrail
link
bill
would
provide
for
a
fast
crosslondon
rail
link
the
paper
says
it
will
go
before
the
house
of
commons
on
february
a
second
reading
could
follow
on
or
march
weve
always
said
we
are
going
to
introduce
a
hybrid
bill
for
crossrail
in
the
spring
and
this
remains
the
case
the
department
for
transport
said
on
sunday
jeremy
de
souza
a
spokesman
for
crossrail
said
on
sunday
he
could
not
confirm
whether
the
treasury
was
planning
to
invest
â£bn
or
when
the
bill
would
go
before
parliament
however
he
said
some
impetus
may
have
been
provided
by
the
proximity
of
an
election
the
new
line
would
go
out
as
far
as
maidenhead
berkshire
to
the
west
of
london
and
link
heathrow
to
canary
wharf
via
the
city
heathrow
to
the
city
would
take
minutes
dramatically
cutting
journey
times
for
business
travellers
and
reducing
overcrowding
on
the
tube
the
line
has
the
support
of
the
mayor
of
london
ken
livingstone
business
groups
and
the
government
but
there
have
been
three
years
of
arguments
over
how
it
should
be
funded
the
mail
on
sundays
financial
mail
said
the
â£bn
of
treasury
money
was
earmarked
for
spending
in
â£bn
instalments
