home
loan
approvals
rising
again
the
number
of
mortgages
approved
in
the
uk
has
risen
for
the
first
time
since
may
last
year
according
to
lending
figures
from
the
bank
of
england
new
loans
in
december
rose
to
slightly
higher
than
novembers
nineyear
low
of
mortgage
lending
rose
by
â£bn
in
december
up
from
a
â£bn
rise
in
november
the
figures
contradict
a
survey
from
the
british
bankers
association
which
said
approvals
were
at
a
fiveyear
low
analysts
say
the
figures
show
the
market
may
be
stabilising
but
still
point
to
further
house
price
softness
the
modest
rise
in
mortgage
approvals
and
lending
in
december
reinforces
the
impression
that
the
housing
market
is
currently
slowing
steadily
rather
than
sharply
said
global
insight
analyst
howard
archer
commenting
on
the
boes
figures
the
bba
believes
that
the
property
market
is
continuing
to
cool
down
changes
to
mortgage
regulation
may
have
artificially
depressed
figures
in
november
thus
flattering
the
december
figures
analysts
said
in
october
last
year
new
rules
came
into
force
which
meant
some
lenders
were
forced
to
withdraw
mortgage
products
temporarily
in
november
and
defer
some
lending
until
they
had
made
sure
they
had
complied
with
the
rules
properly
separately
the
bank
of
england
said
that
consumer
credit
rose
by
â£bn
in
december
more
than
the
â£bn
expected
and
above
the
â£bn
reported
in
the
previous
month
