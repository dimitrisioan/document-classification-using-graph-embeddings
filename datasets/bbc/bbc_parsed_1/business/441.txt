the

ons
said
eu
exports
rose
fuelled
by
an
increase
in
sales
of
chemicals
noneu
exports
shot
up
with
growth
seen
across
a
range
of
manufacturing
sectors
including
cars
consumer
durables
and
chemicals
the
export
boost
offset
a
rise
in
imports
noneu
imports
rose
but
the
growth
in
goods
entering
the
uk
from
the
eu
slowed
to
the
uks

with
the
eu
fell
to
â£bn
from

while
its
noneu
shortfall
dropped
to
â£bn
from
â£bn
in
october
the
countrys
surplus
on

remained
steady
at
â£bn
for
the
fifth
month
in
a
row
paul
dales
uk
economist
for
capital
economics
said
the
figures
represented
an
improvement
on
recent
months
however
he
stressed
that
the
longterm
prognosis
for
exports
was
still
uncertain
the
figures
are
a
lot
better
than
expected
but
the
trend
still
remains
poor
he
said
there
have
been
some
very
encouraging
signs
that
the
uk
export
recovery
is
starting
to
take
hold
but
there
is
a
danger
that
this
could
be
held
back
by
the
ongoing
weakness
of
domestic
demand
on
the
continent
