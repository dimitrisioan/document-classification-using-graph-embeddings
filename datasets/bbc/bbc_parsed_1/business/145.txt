analysts
say
winndixie
had
not
kept
up
with
consumers
demands
and
had
also
been
burdened
by
a
number
of
stores
in
need
of
upgrading
a
month
restructuring
plan
was
deemed
a
failure
and
following
a

winndixies
slide
into
bankruptcy
was

companys
new
chief
executive
peter
lynch
said
winndixie
would
use
the
chapter
breathing
space
to
take
the
necessary
action
to
turn
itself
around
this
includes
achieving
significant
cost
reductions
improving
the
merchandising
and
customer
service
in
all
locations
and
generating
a
sense
of
excitement
in

analyst
at
gim

credit
said
mr
lynchs
job
would
not
be
easy
as
the
bankruptcy
would
inevitably
put
off
some
customers
the
real
big
issue
is
whats
going
to
happen
over
the
next
one
or
two
quarters
now
that
they
are
in
bankruptcy
and
all
their
customers
see
this
in
their
local
newspapers
