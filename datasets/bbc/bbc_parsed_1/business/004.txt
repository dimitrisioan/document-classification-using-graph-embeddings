british
airways
has
blamed
high
fuel
prices

a
drop
in

reporting
its
results
for
the
three
months

the
airline
made
a

of
â£m
m
compared
with
â£m
a
year
earlier
rod
eddington
bas
chief
executive
said
the
results
were
respectable
in
a
third
quarter
when
fuel
costs
rose
by
â£m
or
bas
profits
were
still
better
than
market
expectation
of
â£m
and
it
expects
a
rise
in
fullyear
revenues
to
help
offset
the
increased
price
of
aviation
fuel
ba
last
year
introduced
a
fuel
surcharge
for
passengers
in
october
it
increased
this
from
â£
to
â£
oneway
for
all
longhaul
flights
while
the
shorthaul
surcharge
was
raised
from
â£
to
â£
a

yet
aviation
analyst
mike
powell
of
dresdner
kleinwort
wasserstein
says
bas
estimated
annual
surcharge
revenues
â£m
will
still
be
way
short
of
its
additional
fuel
costs
a
predicted
extra
â£m
turnover
for
the
quarter
was
up
to
â£bn
further
benefiting
from
a
rise
in
cargo
revenue
looking
ahead
to
its
full
year
results
to
march
ba
warned
that
yields
average
revenues
per
passenger
were
expected
to
decline
as
it
continues
to
lower
prices
in
the
face
of
competition
from
lowcost
carriers
however
it
said
sales
would
be
better
than
previously
forecast
for
the
year
to
march
the
total
revenue
outlook
is
slightly
better
than
previous
guidance
with
a
to
improvement
anticipated
ba
chairman
martin
broughton
said
ba
had
previously
forecast
a
to
rise
in
fullyear
revenue
it
also
reported
on
friday
that
passenger
numbers
rose
in
january
aviation
analyst
nick
van
den
brul
of
bnp
paribas
described
bas
latest
quarterly
results
as
pretty
modest
it
is
quite
good
on
the
revenue
side
and
it
shows
the
impact
of
fuel
surcharges
and
a
positive
cargo
development
however
operating
margins
down
and
cost
impact
of
fuel
are
very
strong
he
said
since
the
september
attacks
in
the
united
states
ba
has
cut
jobs
as
part
of
a
major
costcutting
drive
our
focus
remains
on
reducing
controllable
costs
and
debt
whilst
continuing
to
invest
in
our
products
mr
eddington
said
for
example
we
have
taken
delivery
of
six
airbus
a
aircraft
and
next
month
we
will
start
further
improvements
