cohen
for
his
character
ali
gs
horrible
brand
of
victim

be
sitting
at
home
on
the
sofa
vegetating

were
always
mindful
of
their
family
audience
while

was
goodnatured
he

we
knew
what
would
upset
the

theres
a
lot
of
swearing
on

goes
on
to
criticise
reality
programmes
where
they
put

a
house
for
a
fortnight

claims
he
and
barker
differ
from
todays
celebrities
in
that
they
did
not
allow
their
success
to
go
to
their
heads
we
were
never
temperamental
fractious
or
walked
out
slamming
doors
he
said
we
were
fussy
though
he
added
we
wanted
everything
done
properly
