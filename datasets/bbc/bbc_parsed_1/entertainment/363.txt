oscar
nominees
lack
pulling
power
this
years
clutch
of
oscar
nominees
have
been
the
least
popular
for
years
according
to
box
office
figures
in
the
us
the
five
nominated
for
best
film
have
been
seen
by
fewer
people
than
movies
in
previous
years
while
the
awards
are
not
based
on
box
office
popularity
there
is
concern
for
the
ratings
of
the
televised
ceremony
we
dont
have
a
titanic
or
a
lord
of
the
rings
out
there
i
think
its
fair
to
say
it
does
concern
us
a
bit
said
academy
executive
director
bruce
davis
about
million
people
in
the
us
have
seen
this
years
nominees
compared
with
between
million
and
million
in
recent
years
the
last
time
combined
attendance
was
so
low
was
in
when
amadeus
beat
the
killing
fields
a
passage
to
india
places
in
the
heart
and
a
soldiers
story
to
best
picture
when
million
saw
the
five
films
last
years
ceremony
attracted
the
highest
audience
in
four
years
as
viewers
tuned
in
to
see
lord
of
the
ring
return
of
the
king
sweep
the
board
and
the
show
reaped
its
biggest
audience
in
when
titanic
took
home
oscars
the
film
had
taken
m
â£m
worldwide
before
the
ceremony
and
eventually
took
bn
â£m
eyeballs
starring
at
the
movie
screen
translates
to
eyeballs
staring
at
the
tv
screen
said
paul
dergarabedian
of
box
office
tracker
exhibitor
relations
people
like
to
have
a
vested
interest
in
what
theyre
watching
when
titanic
does
bn
in
worldwide
box
office
youve
got
a
lot
of
people
with
a
vested
interest
past
years
have
also
seen
blockbusters
such
as
saving
private
ryan
forrest
gump
and
ghost
compete
for
oscars
the
biggest
box
office
hitter
among
this
years
nominees
is
the
aviator
which
has
taken
m
â£m
in
the
us
although
takings
in
the
uk
have
reached
only
â£m
so
far
lowbudget
move
sideways
and
finding
neverland
have
so
far
grossed
about
m
â£m
each
the
years
biggest
blockbusters
do
actually
feature
in
the
oscar
nominees
but
in
the
animation
category
shrek
and
the
incredibles
took
m
â£m
while
the
incredibles
took
m
â£m
mel
gibsons
the
passion
of
the
christ
which
took
m
â£m
in
the
us
was
largely
ignored
by
academy
voters
but
many
in
the
film
industry
do
not
equate
award
and
box
office
success
i
have
never
equated
the
academy
awards
with
how
much
money
a
movie
takes
in
said
nikki
rocco
head
of
distribution
at
universal
which
released
nominee
ray
thats
the
peoples
choice
awards
this
is
not
about
the
public
this
is
about
the
industry
bestowing
awards
on
what
they
think
are
the
best
films
of
the
year
