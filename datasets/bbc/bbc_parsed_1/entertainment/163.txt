nogars
son
stephen
said
and
frankly
we
could
use
the
money
nogar
who
died
in
aged
always
used
to
make
two
tapes
of
sessions
as
a
backup
in
case
rca
producers
wanted
to
make
late
changes
to
songs
he
called
them
his
asssaver
tapes
his
son
said
the
quality
is
said
to
be
noticeably
crisper
than
that
of
a
new
vinyl
record
because
the
family
does
not
own

the
music
the

can
only

personal
enjoyment
and
they
