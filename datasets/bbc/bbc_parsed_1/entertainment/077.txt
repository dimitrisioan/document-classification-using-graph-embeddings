spiderman
its
a
universal
rule
that
a
film
can
either
be
a
superhero
special
effects
extravaganza
or
it
can
be
good
but
spiderman
breaks
that
rule
in
two
its
not
fantastically
deep
but
you
get
quickly
drawn
into
the
tale
of
spidey
versus
doc
ock
and
more
so
into
the
fate
of
poor
peter
parker
gigantic
action
set
pieces
seamlessly
work
with
more
brooding
personal
torment
and
it
all
looks
stunning
a
few
effects
look
false
but
tobey
maguire
kirsten
dunst
and
alfred
molina
make
this
compelling
the
other
universal
rule
is
that
dvds
of
superhero
films
will
have
making
of
features
only
about
the
effects
this
disc
covers
those
special
effects
enough
but
as
just
one
part
of
a
detailed
look
at
the
film
then
there
are
commentaries
trailers
and
a
blooper
reel
sometimes
quality
comes
in
bulk
this
set
contains
no
less
than
john
wayne
films
ranging
from
the
westerns
and
war
movies
to
the
quiet
man
now
is
that
a
christmas
present
or
what
give
this
to
someone
on
december
and
you
wont
see
them
again
until
early
in
the
new
year
its
not
truly
a
complete
collection
and
leans
more
toward
waynes
earlier
films
theres
no
true
grit
for
instance
though
there
is
hellraisers
the
films
look
well
transferred
to
dvd
though
none
has
extras
it
was
very
daft
but
it
knew
it
was
and
somehow
this
famous
series
became
a
cult
favourite
thats
been
long
awaited
on
dvd
this
set
has
the
first
season
of
buck
gil
gerard
and
wilmas
erin
gray
tongueincheek
adventures
and
its
all
as
camp
and
gaudy
as
you
remember
but
its
also
a
disappointment
the
us
dvd
has
this
and
the
more
pofaced
second
season
and
you
can
import
it
for
just
about
the
same
price
the
bigger
omission
though
is
that
there
are
no
extras
thats
particularly
disappointing
because
originally
there
were
meant
to
be
commentaries
and
stars
gerard
and
gray
had
agreed
to
do
them
