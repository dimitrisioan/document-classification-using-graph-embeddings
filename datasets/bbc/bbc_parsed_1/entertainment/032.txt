redfords
vision
of
sundance
despite
sporting
a
corduroy
cap
pulled
low
over
his
face
plus
a
pair
of
dark
glasses
robert
redford
cuts
an
unmistakable
figure
through
the
starstruck
crowds
at
sundance
its
a
rare
downtown
appearance
for
the
man
who
started
the
annual
festival
in
park
city
utah
back
in
the
s
now
in
its
twentyfirst
year
sundance
continues
to
grow
some
people
are
estimated
to
have
descended
on
this
small
ski
town
with
nothing
but
movies
on
the
mind
its
an
opportunity
to
meet
and
make
deals
redford
wanted
sundance
to
be
a
platform
for
independent
filmmakers
but
the
commercial
success
of
many
showcased
films
have
led
to
criticism
that
the
festival
is
becoming
too
mainstream
smaller
festivals
like
slamdance
and
xdance
which
take
place
during
the
same
week
in
park
city
are
competing
for
sundances
limelight
but
redford
is
not
worried
the
more
the
merrier
he
says
the
point
was
to
create
opportunities
for
people
who
may
not
have
them
once
independent
film
had
a
place
where
the
work
could
be
seen
suddenly
the
merchants
came
with
them
the
celebrities
came
then
the
paparazzi
and
suddenly
it
began
to
take
on
a
whole
new
tone
explains
redford
people
started
to
say
we
had
gone
mainstream
and
hollywood
but
actually
hollywood
came
to
us
because
suddenly
there
was
good
business
in
independent
film
he
adds
international
filmmakers
have
always
been
celebrated
here
but
is
the
first
year
a
dedicated
world
dramatic
and
documentary
competition
is
being
held
redford
wants
the
festival
to
encompass
viewpoints
he
believes
the
american
media
fails
to
reflect
particularly
how
the
us
is
perceived
internationally
he
has
never
hidden
the
fact
that
he
is
a
democrat
but
he
reserves
particular
disdain
for
the
current
republican
administration
its
the
ability
to
maintain
the
importance
of
dissent
in
a
democratic
system
which
right
now
is
under
threat
with
the
attitude
of
this
administration
he
says
i
think
many
voices
are
being
shut
down
or
accused
of
being
unpatriotic
if
they
want
to
express
another
point
of
view
thats
very
unhealthy
and
very
dangerous
if
we
take
that
policy
into
the
world
there
will
be
the
same
victims
and
the
same
consequences
sundance
isnt
just
one
big
screening
there
are
discussion
panels
and
qa
sessions
with
directors
tackling
controversial
topics
like
americas
culture
wars
and
the
iraq
war
while
redford
wishes
the
festival
to
be
a
forum
for
dissent
the
profile
of
the
audience
is
fairly
monolithic
educated
middle
class
and
predominantly
white
americans
comes
sundance
with
views
from
the
same
end
of
the
political
spectrum
antiwar
and
socially
liberal
but
redford
knows
this
and
started
the
sundance
tv
channel
in
an
effort
to
reach
a
wider
audience
when
you
look
at
the
films
here
what
we
are
presenting
is
very
much
egalitarian
and
its
about
good
films
and
good
storytelling
be
it
african
america
asian
women
gay
lesbian
sooner
or
later
we
will
do
away
with
those
stereotypical
labels
and
people
will
say
its
just
a
film
by
soand
so
