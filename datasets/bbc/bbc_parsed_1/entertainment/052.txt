urged
students
at
his
old
atlanta
university
morehouse
college
to
seek
gatekeeper
positions
behind
the
scenes
lee
told
them
to
work
up
the
corporate
ladder

be
an
actor
everybody
cant
make
a

gatekeepers
lee
said
he
told
aspiring
young
filmmakers
in
the
audience
not
to
ignore
nontraditional
routes
to
getting
a
movie
made

raising
funds
independently
and
releasing
films
straight
to

a
huge
market
