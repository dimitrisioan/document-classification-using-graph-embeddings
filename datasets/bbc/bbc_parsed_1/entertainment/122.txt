dance
music
not
dead
says
fatboy
dj
norman
cook
aka
fatboy
slim
has
said
that
dance
music
is
not
dead
but
has
admitted
it
is
currently
going
through
a
fallow
patch
the
commercial
failure
of
the
latest
albums
by
britains
two
biggest
dance
acts
fatboy
slims
palookaville
and
the
prodigys
always
outnumbered
never
outgunned
has
been
coupled
with
the
closure
of
many
superclubs
and
the
folding
of
three
dance
music
magazines
last
month
the
brit
awards
announced
they
would
no
longer
be
awarding
a
best
dance
act
prize
with
the
brits
committee
announcing
that
dance
music
is
no
longer
where
its
happening
in
music
these
developments
lead
some
to
suggest
that
dance
was
finished
as
a
popular
music
genre
cook
acknowledged
that
much
change
in
the
dance
world
in
the
four
years
since
his
last
album
halfway
between
the
gutter
and
the
stars
but
he
stressed
this
did
not
mean
the
dance
scene
was
permanently
over
every
week
when
i
was
making
the
album
i
was
reading
articles
about
the
demise
of
dance
music
and
obviously
that
affects
you
somewhat
he
told
bbc
world
services
the
ticket
programme
i
personally
dont
believe
its
either
dead
or
going
to
die
but
its
going
through
a
bit
of
a
fallow
patch
so
i
think
consciously
or
subconsciously
reading
every
week
that
dance
music
was
dead
i
would
think
right
scrub
that
track
then
although
his
album
sales
in
the
uk
are
down
palookaville
stayed
in
the
uk
top
for
just
three
weeks
cook
has
achieved
recent
global
success
with
his
beach
parties
and
event
on
brighton
sea
front
in
attracted
people
while
a
later
one
in
rio
achieved
a
crowd
of
the
dvd
of
the
rio
set
was
the
biggest
seller
of
that
year
with
a
crowd
that
big
if
the
weathers
nice
the
atmosphere
before
i
even
go
is
so
good
that
about
halfway
through
the
first
record
i
think
ive
got
them
cook
said
im
always
really
really
nervous
before
the
big
ones
they
had
to
give
me
valium
before
rio
because
two
hours
before
i
was
literally
just
pacing
the
floor
for
some
reason
especially
now
ive
got
a
reputation
for
it
the
atmosphere
and
the
joie
de
vivre
thats
already
going
on
means
all
i
have
to
do
is
play
up
records
he
promised
more
such
parties
in
more
locations
around
the
world
despite
problems
after
the
brighton
event
which
ended
in
chaos
with
many
revellers
finding
themselves
stranded
as
transport
ground
to
a
halt
one
man
also
died
of
a
heart
attack
and
a
woman
fell
to
her
death
during
the
free
party
were
having
to
widen
our
horizons
from
just
beaches
because
theres
landlocked
countries
that
want
to
get
involved
cook
said
were
doing
rio
at
the
carnival
at
the
maracana
and
sao
paolo
our
new
gig
is
famous
football
stadiums
the
dj
admitted
however
that
his
massive
worldwide
success
had
a
downside
with
intense
media
interest
in
his
personal
life
in
particular
he
said
he
had
struggled
to
cope
with
tabloid
intrusion
during
the
temporary
breakup
of
his
marriage
to
radio
one
presenter
zoe
ball
after
she
was
linked
with
dj
dan
peppe
the
tabloid
thing
has
been
difficult
at
times
cook
said
especially
the
meandzoegate
its
quite
scary
he
said
that
he
had
been
determined
that
what
had
happened
with
ball
did
not
affect
the
album
at
first
i
was
doing
deliberately
jolly
tunes
so
that
people
wouldnt
think
i
was
depressed
he
explained
then
i
thought
thats
not
right
and
he
highlighted
a
bizarre
coincidence
that
one
song
written
before
they
split
had
turned
out
to
have
a
great
deal
more
meaning
than
intended
i
said
to
zoe
i
did
this
track
called
my
masochistic
baby
went
and
left
me
do
you
mind
if
its
on
the
album
he
recalled
she
said
yeah
its
hilarious
because
your
masochistic
baby
did
leave
you
cook
also
added
that
he
had
some
ways
of
coping
with
the
intense
paparazzi
pressure
which
accumulates
at
the
end
of
the
private
road
he
lives
on
where
paul
mccartney
is
a
neighbour
its
almost
like
prisoners
rattling
the
bars
with
their
mugs
cook
explained
if
theres
a
pap
at
the
end
of
the
road
everyone
knocks
on
each
others
doors
paul
comes
round
and
we
warn
him
because
we
dont
know
who
theyre
after
