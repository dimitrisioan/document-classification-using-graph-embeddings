franz
man
seeks
government
help
franz
ferdinand
frontman
alex
kapranos
has
called
for
more
government
help
for
musicians
while
taking
part
in
an
edinburgh
lectures
discussion
for
any
cultural
output
to
thrive
there
needs
to
be
some
kind
of
state
input
to
that
as
well
he
said
but
kapranos
warned
against
musicians
being
too
closely
linked
with
mps
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
event
i
think
the
role
of
musicians
is
to
question
politicians
rather
than
to
go
to
bed
with
them
he
said
kapranos
joined
the
prestigious
lecture
series
to
discuss
scotlands
role
in
making
st
century
music
there
are
elements
of
our
musical
output
which
require
sustenance
because
they
arent
selfsufficient
he
said
but
socalled
commercial
music
would
benefit
from
investment
as
well
he
warned
musicians
against
being
allied
to
a
particular
party
however
i
dont
know
if
having
tea
with
politicians
is
always
a
good
idea
kapranos
and
his
glasgow
fourpiece
band
have
been
nominated
for
five
prizes
at
next
weeks
brit
awards
including
best
group
and
best
album
their
selftitled
debut
album
won
last
years
mercury
music
prize
and
spawned
three
top
singles
he
told
the
strong
audience
at
the
universitys
reid
hall
that
musicians
should
listen
to
a
wide
range
of
music
and
should
not
be
restricted
by
stereotypes
we
say
i
like
this
because
i
listen
to
nirvana
and
korn
i
am
a
troubled
individual
im
riddled
with
angst
because
i
listen
to
chopin
and
debussy
i
listen
to
kylie
minogue
and
scissor
sisters
because
im
upbeat
and
i
like
to
party
i
listen
to
wagner
because
i
like
the
smell
of
napalm
in
the
morning
kapranos
said
there
was
a
general
hostility
towards
classical
music
adding
there
is
very
little
done
to
break
that
hostility
other
than
classic
fm
he
concluded
we
define
ourselves
as
a
nation
by
the
way
we
encourage
our
creativity
fellow
speaker
and
classical
composer
james
macmillan
agreed
we
need
to
rediscover
our
ability
to
listen
previous
speakers
at
the
edinburgh
lectures
series
have
included
former
soviet
leader
mikhail
gorbachev
and
author
professor
stephen
hawking
kapranos
described
his
appearance
on
wednesday
as
more
daunting
by
a
long
way
than
their
upcoming
brits
performance
i
dont
really
care
about
the
brits
he
said
its
going
to
be
great
to
go
down
but
i
have
actually
had
to
exercise
part
of
my
brain
tonight
i
think
the
government
should
do
more
to
help
upandcoming
artists
be
discovered
by
scrapping
the
entertainment
licences
for
live
venues
also
they
should
do
more
to
help
independent
record
labels
have
a
louder
voice
within
an
industry
dominated
by
commercialised
major
labels
rather
than
expecting
the
government
ie
the
taxpayer
to
fork
out
why
dont
some
of
the
megastars
put
something
back
in
some
of
britains
wealthiest
people
are
musicians
who
have
raked
it
in
from
albums
concerts
etc
there
are
far
more
important
demands
on
government
funds
if
they
can
fund
football
why
not
fund
music
areas
of
the
arts
are
funded
by
government
and
lottery
grants
so
why
not
music
we
already
have
the
opera
receiving
huge
grants
and
it
would
clearly
be
beneficial
for
diversity
in
music
to
have
the
same
opportunities
in
other
areas
of
the
music
the
only
problem
would
be
how
to
judge
what
merits
state
cash
the
government
has
enough
problems
funding
schools
and
health
services
if
alex
kapranos
genuinely
thinks
a
multibillion
pound
industry
should
also
have
government
funding
then
his
own
education
was
seriously
lacking
and
more
money
should
be
put
into
that
as
a
scot
living
in
england
i
appreciate
the
value
of
scottish
music
and
culture
being
a
success
so
i
can
see
no
problem
with
it
franz
ferdinand
travis
and
snow
patrol
are
just
recent
examples
of
the
success
scottish
music
can
have
in
the
world
so
we
should
do
what
we
scots
are
good
at
and
support
our
own
goods
i
think
the
issue
is
more
fundamental
should
the
government
be
spending
money
on
subsidising
a
multimillion
pound
industry
when
health
and
education
are
in
such
a
sorry
state
the
answer
is
most
definitely
no
those
people
who
are
lucky
enough
to
pursue
their
passion
to
get
their
pay
cheque
shouldnt
be
looking
for
government
subsidies
i
know
that
if
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
pursue
my
dream
of
show
jumping
i
would
want
to
finance
myself
until
i
was
in
a
position
to
pursue
corporate
sponsorship
yes
the
government
should
fund
music
it
brings
joy
to
the
masses
there
are
already
thousands
of
statefunded
musicians
out
there
sitting
around
twiddling
their
thumbs
on
the
new
deal
getting
the
government
even
more
involved
would
only
waste
money
that
could
be
put
to
better
use
as
long
as
the
government
was
funding
real
talent
it
would
be
a
great
move
i
would
hate
to
see
more
pop
idoltype
funding
of
music
though
as
it
would
only
serve
to
reinforce
the
stereotypes
that
alex
talked
about
only
if
the
proposals
make
financial
sense
franz
ferdinand
must
be
paying
serious
amounts
of
tax
on
their
record
sales
if
theyd
had
a
government
grant
to
get
started
theyd
have
more
than
paid
it
back
by
now
so
the
treasury
would
be
making
far
more
than
it
paid
out
however
the
government
has
better
things
to
spend
its
money
on
than
to
give
charity
to
everyone
who
decides
theyre
a
musician
the
government
shouldnt
fund
music
it
should
invest
in
music
and
those
investments
should
be
treated
like
any
other
investment
i
think
the
government
needs
to
provide
facilities
and
for
young
groups
and
bands
to
form
and
practise
the
equipment
is
not
cheap
and
can
be
well
beyond
the
means
of
many
people
however
i
do
feel
this
should
be
the
extent
of
their
role
to
provide
the
conditions
for
the
talent
to
flourish
and
let
it
go
from
there
i
do
agree
that
the
government
should
help
to
fund
music
but
there
is
also
a
responsibility
held
by
record
companies
they
generally
always
opt
for
the
tried
and
tested
and
tend
not
to
want
to
break
any
moulds
or
risk
losing
any
money
which
ultimately
the
directors
are
in
the
business
for
if
labels
were
more
willing
to
put
money
forward
towards
smaller
breakthrough
acts
then
the
government
wouldnt
have
to
fork
out
a
great
deal
yeah
why
not
music
should
be
government
funded
particularly
the
work
of
modern
composers
and
veteran
bandsartists
and
stuff
pop
music
pretty
much
rules
the
earth
so
more
attention
should
go
to
the
other
fraternities
i
agree
with
funding
the
arts
to
make
it
more
accessible
to
the
public
but
i
am
not
convinced
that
pop
music
requires
financial
support
from
the
taxpayer
there
is
a
great
deal
of
money
generated
through
pop
music
perhaps
a
tax
on
pop
could
be
ploughed
into
the
public
performance
of
other
forms
of
music
for
everyone
to
enjoy
perhaps
we
could
financially
penalise
really
bad
pop
idolstyle
music
that
is
the
music
industry
sector
without
any
artistic
merit
or
originality
whatsoever
and
that
which
is
specifically
designed
to
line
the
pockets
of
music
producers
call
it
a
tax
on
music
pollution
if
you
like
though
i
really
like
franz
ferdinand
i
have
to
disagree
with
mr
kapranos
once
government
gets
their
hand
into
the
private
sector
it
will
destroy
the
creative
and
possibly
controversial
avenues
the
artist
pursues
many
years
ago
this
was
the
case
with
the
us
nea
when
the
government
started
to
question
what
was
considered
art
for
the
money
they
were
allotting
the
solution
mr
kapranos
should
pursue
would
be
privatelyfunded
organizations
like
save
the
music
in
the
us
