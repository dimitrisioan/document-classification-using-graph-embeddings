the
film
which
she
has
controversially
made
in
a
bollywood
style
including
two
songanddance
routines
in
the
films
second
half
it
was
serendipity
really
i
was
offered
vanity
fair
by
the
studio
focus
features
who
had
distributed
monsoon
wedding
nair
told
bbc
world
services
masterpiece
programme
they
offered
me
their
nextbest
thing
not
realising
that
vanity
fair
had
actually
been
one
of
my
favourite
novels
since
i
was
years
old
in
an
irish
catholic
boarding
school
in
india
since
her
debut
feature
salaam
bombay
nominated
for
the
best
foreign
language
oscar
and
winner
of
best
first
feature
at
cannes
nair
has
become
one
of
indias
most
famous
and
respected
directors
she
is
not
restricted
to
bollywood
however
she
followed
salaam
bombay
with
mississippi
masala
starring
denzel
washington
and
the
perez
family
her
first
hollywood
film
her
career
peaked
with
monsoon
wedding
in
which
won
the
golden
lion
award
at
venice
nairs
indianstyle
adaptation
of
vanity
fair
however
has
been
attacked
by
critics
in
the
us
where
it
only
reached
number
eight
at
the
box
office
in
its
opening
week
who
described
the
bollywood
elements
as
jarring
the
film
has
a
new
ending
with
becky
sharp
running
off
for
a
new
life
in
india
but
nair
said
that
her
film
had
picked
up
on
the
way
thackeray
who
was
born
in
india
but
moved
to
england
as
a
young
man
had
seen
the
world
first
when
i
was
it
was
becky
sharp
who
is
a
completely
memorable
character
because
i
recognised
myself
in
her
i
recognised
all
the
ladies
who
did
not
want
to
be
ladies
who
wanted
to
buck
the
system
that
they
were
in
she
said
but
it
was
the
sort
of
novel
i
somehow
kept
at
the
side
of
my
bed
for
many
years
and
i
would
dip
into
every
now
and
then
and
suddenly
get
completely
mesmerised
again
as
i
got
older
and
read
it
i
think
it
was
thackerays
clarity
his
clearsightedness
about
his
own
society
the
fact
that
he
was
born
in
india
but
came
to
england
as
a
young
man
that
gave
him
the
eyes
of
an
outsider
and
yet
he
was
an
insider
that
perspective
was
something
i
really
loved
nair
also
defended
her
decision
to
cast
an
american
actress
reese
witherspoon
as
becky
sharp
despite
the
fact
that
all
the
rest
of
the
cast
are
british
or
irish
i
cast
intuitively
in
my
films
i
cast
as
many
nonactors
as
i
cast
actors
she
said
for
me
it
is
intuition
i
have
to
fall
in
love
with
an
actor
it
is
a
visceral
response
thackeray
describes
becky
sharp
as
a
minx
also
shes
described
as
someone
whos
tiny
redheaded
and
thin
reese
had
that
completely
minxlike
irresistibility
about
her
having
won
the
role
because
she
seemed
physically
perfectly
suited
to
the
part
however
witherspoon
then
became
pregnant
but
nair
said
that
though
this
had
created
the
need
for
some
filming
tricks
it
had
in
fact
also
helped
the
film
it
was
a
selffulfilling
prophesy
when
i
first
met
her
husband
actor
ryan
philippe
i
said
knock
her
up
wont
you
i
need
some
flesh
on
the
girl
she
joked
im
not
a
fan
of
the
underfed
los
angeles
actor
at
all
this
was
for
me
about
becky
sharp
being
eventually
a
fullblown
woman
through
the
course
of
the
film
i
love
the
luminosity
that
pregnancy
brings
i
love
the
fleshiness
i
love
the
ample
bosom
it
gave
me
much
more
to
play
with
nair
explained
how
camera
tricks
had
been
used
to
disguise
witherspoons
bump
in
various
scenes
including
hiring
a
number
of
young
boys
in
costumes
to
stand
in
front
of
her
she
runs
she
gets
off
coal
carts
she
jumps
off
horses
she
does
everything
nair
said
but
theres
also
a
certain
carriage
with
horses
that
is
going
to
wipe
the
screen
at
a
certain
moment
because
of
the
bump
