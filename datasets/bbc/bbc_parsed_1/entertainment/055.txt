dvd
review
i
robot
only
one
man
recognises
that
robots
are
a
threat
to
humanity
but
thats
fine
because
it
only
takes
one
man
to
save
the
day
in
the
thriller
i
robot
will
smith
costars
alongside
more
cgi
robots
than
you
can
count
and
as
a
thrillaminute
kind
of
action
film
its
perfectly
adequate
youll
have
forgotten
it
all
tomorrow
but
youll
have
a
fun
night
with
the
film
and
all
the
extras
there
is
a
onedisc
version
that
has
commentaries
and
a
making
of
but
the
twodisc
adds
more
unusually
for
this
kind
of
film
the
extras
dont
solely
concentrate
on
the
special
effects
theyre
covered
but
theres
also
a
general
production
diary
and
a
postproduction
feature
remember
the
national
lotterys
draw
machines
arthur
and
guinevere
they
were
more
accurate
than
this
glossy
hollywood
version
of
the
tale
but
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
a
documentary
live
with
it
king
arthur
is
a
fun
exciting
totally
shallow
experience
and
looks
excellent
clive
owen
is
the
brooding
king
keira
knightly
rises
above
her
costume
and
ray
winstone
gives
it
all
some
grit
its
at
its
best
in
its
battle
scenes
which
are
well
done
and
are
also
the
best
part
of
the
making
of
extra
less
flashy
than
a
david
attenborough
show
and
less
detailed
than
a
simon
schama
one
the
bbc
series
british
isles
nevertheless
turned
out
to
be
quite
engrossing
admit
it
the
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
shows
alan
titchmarsh
left
ground
force
to
present
did
mean
that
you
expected
something
equally
frothy
but
titchmarsh
turns
out
to
know
his
subject
and
the
sight
of
our
presentday
landscape
being
peeled
back
to
reveal
the
past
was
fascinating
hes
now
written
an
accompanying
book
too
