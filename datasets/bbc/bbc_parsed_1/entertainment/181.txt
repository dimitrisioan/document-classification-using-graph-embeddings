chris
evans
back
on
the
market
broadcaster
chris
evans
has
begun
selling
thousands
of
his
possessions
from
a
stall
in
camden
market
london
evans
perched
on
a
stool
as
shoppers
wandered
around
the
openfronted
shop
packed
with
his
furniture
among
the
items
from
his
homes
in
los
angeles
and
london
were
countless
sofas
chairs
pictures
beds
and
memorabilia
from
his
past
tv
shows
asked
the
reason
for
the
sale
evans
said
i
just
want
to
get
rid
of
it
all
its
just
a
headache
he
added
it
feels
good
to
be
selling
this
stuff
its
a
weight
off
my
mind
look
at
it
all
theres
so
much
clutter
ive
enjoyed
every
bit
of
furniture
and
every
poster
but
its
not
important
anymore
the
normally
gregarious
evans
cut
a
peculiarly
unshowbusinesslike
figure
as
he
sipped
coffee
and
smoked
cigarettes
wrapped
in
a
big
coat
and
scarf
in
front
of
his
aladdins
cave
however
the
ostentation
of
some
of
the
items
on
sale
painted
a
picture
of
the
eccentricity
that
endeared
him
to
the
british
public
in
shows
such
as
channel
s
gameshow
dont
forget
your
toothbrush
the
most
striking
thing
about
many
of
the
pieces
was
their
sheer
size
sofas
looked
like
they
could
seat
a
small
party
and
a
bed
seemed
big
enough
for
four
the
elaborate
nature
of
the
pieces
many
custommade
had
to
be
admired
particularly
a
huge
red
and
gold
upholstered
throne
and
a
stripy
deckchair
from
the
queen
mary
liner
to
help
people
in
their
browsing
evans
had
given
the
pieces
labels
with
not
only
the
price
but
a
helpful
often
comic
aside
isnt
it
great
was
the
comment
on
the
â£
throne
and
bob
dylans
old
sofa
honest
was
written
on
a
dark
wood
couch
priced
â£
the
prices
were
steep
by
a
lot
of
peoples
standards
but
evans
said
it
was
not
deterring
shoppers
ive
sold
quite
a
lot
already
everything
here
is
on
sale
for
less
than
i
bought
it
for
but
its
not
really
about
the
money
its
about
getting
rid
of
it
all
weve
all
been
bartering
thats
what
its
all
about
he
added
that
he
was
not
going
to
reveal
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
money
he
was
making
vintage
tv
and
film
posters
also
lined
the
walls
including
a
rare
portrait
of
raquel
welch
and
an
original
advertising
print
from
the
benny
hill
show
and
almost
hidden
at
the
back
of
the
lockup
were
the
two
giant
toothbrushes
from
his
former
channel
show
although
these
were
not
for
sale
despite
the
sheer
curiosity
value
of
the
sale
there
was
a
healthy
trickle
of
interest
from
the
public
rather
than
the
perhaps
expected
crowds
some
wandered
in
just
to
browse
as
they
would
any
of
the
other
stalls
not
knowing
that
it
belonged
to
evans
paul
burgess
said
i
didnt
realise
i
thought
it
was
just
a
load
of
junk
i
should
go
back
and
have
a
better
look
but
local
resident
francesca
detakats
came
specially
to
the
stall
and
left
happy
with
her
purchase
of
an
original
s
photograph
of
the
who
by
david
wedgburg
ms
detakats
said
she
was
a
collector
and
did
not
mind
paying
â£
for
the
print
if
you
like
something
you
dont
really
count
it
like
that
she
said
martin
hellewell
who
had
also
made
a
point
of
visiting
evans
shop
said
he
thought
it
was
a
great
idea
why
not
if
youve
got
stuff
to
get
rid
of
its
a
good
place
to
do
it
said
mr
hellewell
evans
has
taken
out
the
stall
with
business
partner
pete
winterbottom
they
plan
to
open
every
day
if
possible
although
evans
did
not
know
how
often
he
would
be
there
well
stay
definitely
until
christmas
and
then
maybe
a
week
after
that

evans
