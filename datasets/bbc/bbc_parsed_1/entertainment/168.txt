at
the
forefront
of
a
vociferous

clean
up

said
it
was
unfair
and
inaccurate

single
out
mtv

and
conservative
activist
said
mtv
is
blatantly
selling
raunchy
sex
to
kids
compared
to
broadcast
television
programmes
aimed
at
adults
mtvs
programming
contains
substantially
more
sex
foul
language
and
violence
and
mtvs
shows
are
aimed
at
children
as
young
as
theres
no
question
that
tv
influences
the
attitudes
and
perceptions
of
young
viewers
and
mtv
is
deliberately
marketing
its
raunch
to
millions
of
innocent
children
the

decided
to
look
at
mtvs
programmes
after
janet

years
super

generated
complaints
and
cbs

company
as
mtv
was
quick
to
apologise
mtv
spokeswoman
jeannie
kedas
said
the
network
follows
the
same
standards
as
broadcasters
and
reflects
the
culture
and
what
its
viewers
are
interested
in
its
unfair
and
inaccurate
to
paint
mtv
with
that
brush
of
irresponsibility
she
said
we
think
its
underestimating
young
peoples
intellect
and
level
of
sophistication
ms

also
highlighted
the
fact

an
award
in
