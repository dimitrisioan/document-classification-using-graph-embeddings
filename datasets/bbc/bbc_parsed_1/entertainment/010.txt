in
the
capital
kampala
this
weekend
the
ugandan
media
council
said
the
performance
would
not
be
put
on
as
it
promoted
and
glorified
acts
such
as
lesbianism
and
homosexuality
it
said
the
production
could
go
ahead
if
the
organisers
expunge
all
the
offending
parts
but
the
organisers
of
the
play
say
it
raises
awareness
of
sexual
abuse
against
women
the
play
promotes
illegal
unnatural
sexual
acts
homosexuality
and
prostitution
it
should
be
and
is
hereby
banned
the
councils
ruling
said
the
show
which
has
been
a
controversial
sellout
around
the
world
explores
female
sexuality
and
strength
through
individual
women
telling
their
stories
through
monologues
some
parliamentarians
and
church
leaders
are
also
siding
with
the
media
council
ugandas
new
vision
newspaper
reports
the
play
is
obscene
and
pornographic
although
it
was
under
the
guise
of
womens
liberation
mp
kefa
ssempgani
told
parliament
but
the
works
author
us
playwright
eve
ensler
says
it
is
all
about
womens
empowerment
there
is
obviously
some
fear
of
the
vagina
and
saying
the
word
vagina
ms
ensler
told
the
bbc
its
not
a
slang
word
or
dirty
word
its
a
biological
anatomical
word
she
said
the
play
is
being
produced
and
performed
by
ugandan
women
and
it
is
not
being
forced
on
them
the
four
ugandan
ngos
organising
the
play
intended
to
raise
money
to
campaign
to
stop
violence
against
women
and
to
raise
funds
for
the
wartorn
north
of
the
country
im
extremely
outraged
at
the
hypocrisy
the
plays
organiser
in
uganda
sarah
mukasa
told
the
bbcs
focus
on
africa
programme
im
amazed
that
this
country
uganda
gives
the
impression
that
it
is
progressive
and
supports
womens
rights
and
the
notions
of
free
speech
yet
when
women
want
to
share
their
stories
the
government
uses
the
apparatus
of
state
to
shut
us
up
