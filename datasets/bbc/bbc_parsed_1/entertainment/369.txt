gary
mckendry
the
past
month
has
thrust
them
from

into
the
limelight
arnolds
gritty

everything

country
must

british
soldiers
and
catholics
to

during
the

in
northern
ireland
last
week
the
trio
attended
an
official
screening
of
all
the
nominated
short
films
at
the
academys
headquarters
in
beverly
hills
i
felt
so
privileged
to
have
a
thousand
people
watching
my
film
on
the
biggest
screen
ive
ever
seen
says
arnold
set
in
her
native
dartford
wasp
tells
the
story
of
a
young
mum
who
unable
to
find
a
babysitter
leaves
her
four
young
daughters
outside
a
pub
while
shes
on
a
date
the
image
that
sparked
the
film
was
that
of
a
wasp
crawling
into
a
babys
mouth
the
other
nominees
said
they
made
their
films
for
this
reason
or
that
they
had
something
to
say
but
i
just
start
with
an
image
i
cant
shake
off
work
outwards
from
that
and
see
what
comes
out
she
explains
since
she
presented
childrens
tv
shows
number
and
motormouth
in
the
s
arnold
has
kept
a
low
profile
and
is
having
trouble
adapting
to
this
sudden
onslaught
of
attention
im
not
interested
in
the
publicity
its
not
my
personality
im
overwhelmed
by
all
the
fuss
she
said
its
all
a
bit
like
a
beauty
contest
all
the
films
are
great
and
so
different
but
even
though
my
film
has
won
awards
worldwide
including
one
at
sundance
last
month
id
still
be
proud
of
it
even
if
it
hadnt
won
any
asked
what
the
nomination
means
to
her
arnold
says
she
feels
flattered
and
honoured
weve
all
been
overwhelmed
by
the
response
and
cant
get
it
in
perspective
yet
im
still
reeling
and
she
wont
commit
to
an
opinion
of
hollywood
yet
im
just
in
the
middle
of
it
living
moment
to
moment
day
to
day
but
despite
her
reservations
about
the
academy
awards
and
the
media
frenzy
that
surrounds
it
she
accepts
that
it
has
opened
doors
for
her
people
will
definitely
listen
to
what
i
want
to
do
now
and
the
phone
didnt
stop
ringing
for
a
week
after
i
got
nominated
as
for
the
future
arnold
firmly
believes
that
you
often
get
a
stronger
vision
of
the
world
with
short
films
youre
left
more
to
your
own
devices
without
people
interfering
as
much
that
said
she
is
currently
working
on
a
feature
film
with
dogville
and
dancer
in
the
dark
director

von
trier
