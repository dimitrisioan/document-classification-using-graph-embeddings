has
so
far
eluded

her
status
as
one
of
hollywoods
favourite
actresses
remains
solid
one
of
the
biggest
oscars
buzzes
in
recent
years
was
for
benings
role
as
troubled
carolyn
burnham
in
s
american
beauty
but
her
deliciously
neurotic
portrayal
of
surburban
life
turning
sour
was
overlooked
in
favour
of
hilary
swanks
leading
role
in
boys
dont
cry
after
opening
her
career
in
the
theatre
and
gaining
a

a
lowkey
spell
in

as
a
sexstarved

the
great
outdoors
opposite

came
in
playing
seductive
con
artist
myra
langtry
in
the
grifters
a
role
that
won
her
an
oscar
nomination
despite
some
rave
reviews
bening
did
not
win
the
best
supporting
actress
academy
award
however
the
highprofile
performance
enabled
bening
to
capture
roles
in
a
number
of
big
budget
hollywood
productions
costarring
with
some
of
hollywoods
greatest
players
including
robert
de
niro
and
harrison
ford
but
it
was
her
role
opposite
warren
beatty
in
gangster
flick
bugsy
which
had
the
greatest
impact
bening
played
virginia
hill
another
role
which
won
her
high
critical
acclaim
but
the
film
only
picked
up
two
of
a
staggering
oscar
nominations
bugsy
was
the
start
of
a
very
significant
liaison
for
bening

married

was
the

choice
to
play
the
female
lead
in
american
beauty
director
sam
mendes
film
debut
which
was
a
critical
and
commercial
success
but
the
actress
had
to
be
content
with
a
bafta
award
for
her
strong
performance
but
current
film
being
julia
has
made
bening
an
awardwinning
actress
rather
than
the
perennial
nominee
with
success
at
the
golden
globes
the
witty
tale
of
revenge
and
love
set
in
s
london
sees
the
eponymous
theatrical
diva
played
by
bening
grow
tired
of
her
success
and
fall
for
a
young
american
and
could
