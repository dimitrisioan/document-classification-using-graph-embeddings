fightstar
take
to
the
stage
charlie
simpson
took
his
new
band
fightstar
to
the
stage
on
friday
night
just
hours
after
officially
announcing
his
departure
from
pop
band
busted
he
was
greeted
by
a
sellout
crowd
at
the
university
of
warwick
confirmation
of
busteds
longrumoured
split
had
come
earlier
in
the
day
when
simpson
held
a
press
conference
in
london
with
bandmates
matt
willis
and
james
bourne
all
three
band
members
stressed
that
the
break
up
was
amicable
although
bourne
admitted
he
was
devastated
to
hear
of
simpsons
departure
this
has
been
a
really
difficult
decision
yearold
simpson
revealed
i
hope
the
fans
will
understand
while
simpson
declared
he
would
look
back
with
pride
on
busteds
enormous
success
his
focus
turned
immediately
to
fightstar
with
fridays
press
conference
coinciding
with
the
start
of
the
bands
date
tour
of
the
uk
fuelled
by
this
news
all
tickets
to
see
charlies
first
postbusted
live
appearance
at
the
university
of
warwicks
student
union
sold
out
rapidly
mike
eccleshall
the
venues
promotions
coordinator
said
tickets
had
been
selling
strongly
over
the
past
few
days
but
sales
went
mad
after
the
news
broke
we
had
completely
sold
out
by
pm
with
queues
outside
the
venue
long
and
expectations
high
the
pressure
was
on
fightstar
to
impress
although
many
dedicated
fans
travelled
to
the
gig
from
around
the
country
they
faced
a
tough
crowd
made
up
chiefly
of
students
the
average
age
of
the
audience
far
exceeding
that
of
any
busted
concert
gone
were
the
screaming
girls
to
which
simpson
had
become
accustomed
support
act
brigade
fronted
by
simpsons
brother
played
a
short
set
first
and
were
met
with
general
approval
when
fightstar
eventually
took
to
the
stage
around
pm
however
a
riotous
cheer
easily
drowned
out
any
hecklers
lurking
in
the
crowd
unfortunately
the
band
were
initially
hindered
by
technical
teething
problems
as
simpsons
guitar
amplifier
failed
to
work
as
sound
technicians
rushed
to
fix
it
other
band
members
did
their
best
to
improvise
when
they
eventually
got
under
way
fightstars
blend
of
emotionally
charged
rock
was
warmly
received
far
heavier
and
less
commercial
than
busteds
charttopping
poppunk
the
band
will
undoubtedly
appeal
to
a
more
mature
fanbase
warwick
student
helen
clutterbuck
admitted
i
came
to
check
out
fightstar
because
of
all
the
controversy
ive
never
heard
them
before
but
im
pretty
impressed
less
impressed
were
fellow
students
ryan
crabbe
and
gordon
rennie
who
observed
with
fightstar
charlie
has
clearly
progressed
from
busteds
sound
but
theyre
still
not
very
inspiring
fightstar
played
for
around
minutes
showcasing
material
from
their
forthcoming
ep
called
they
liked
you
better
when
you
were
dead
due
for
release
in
february
