band
kasabian
built
up
a
cult
following
throughout
to
secure
three
brit
award
nominations
the
fourpiece
leicester
band
blends
dark
electronics
with
rock
earning
kasabian
places
on
the
best
british
group
rock
act
and
live
act
shortlists
they
have
also
earned
a
reputation
as
outspoken
and
charismatic
in
contrast
to
fellow
brit
nominees
such
as
keane
and
snow
patrol
british
music
needs
a
kick
up
the
arse
and
britain
needs
a
new
band
to
breathe
life
into
the
british
people
again
declared
kasabians
singer
tom
meighan
noones
doing
it
at
the
minute
music
feels
like
its
in
the
afterlife
right
now
we
dont
want
people
to
give
up
on
it
the
serpents
going
to
rise
from
the
sea
and
scare
all
the
pirates
away
meighan
grew
up
in
leicester
with
kasabian
songwriterguitarist
sergio
pizzorno
and
bassist
chris
edwards
a
trio
which
began
making
music
from
the
age
of
they
enlisted
guitarist
and
keyboard
player
christopher
karloff
after
spotting
him
in
a
pub
we
saw
his
long
sideburns
and
thought
hey
he
looks
the
part
well
ask
him
said
meighan
inspired
by
britpop
and
a
mutual
love
of
hardcore
an
early
s
genre
that
fused
house
music
with
hip
hop
beats
and
a
dark
sensibility
they
added
an
electronic
element
to
the
traditional
guitar
sound
we
got
a
computer
and
we
cut
rocknroll
up
because
theres
no
point
in
going
back
to
how
it
was
said
meighan
its
all
about
new
ideas
and
creativity
the
bands
original
approach
is
reflected
in
its
name
inspired
by
linda
kasabian
the
getaway
driver
of
us
serial
killer
charles
manson
coincidentally
it
is
also
the
armenian
term
for
butcher
kasabian
moved
into
a
remote
farmhouse
in
rutland
to
record
their
debut
album
benefiting
from
its
isolation
but
also
managing
to
sneak
in
a
few
parties
while
they
were
there
signed
to
the
rca
record
label
kasabian
tested
the
water
with
two
singles
club
foot
and
lsf
which
reached
numbers
and
in
the
uk
singles
chart
respectively
they
built
up
their
following
on
the
summer
festival
circuit
opening
both
glastonbury
and
t
in
the
park
and
at
a
series
of
guerilla
gigs
at
unusual
venues
including
half
time
orange
a
pub
next
to
leicester
city
football
clubs
headquarters
kasabians
selftitled
album
was
released
last
september
to
widespread
critical
acclaim
its
indie
dance
stance
drawing
comparisons
to
the
stone
roses
primal
scream
and
the
happy
mondays
regarding
it
as
both
a
fiery
assertion
of
rock
n
roll
ethics
and
proof
that
a
siege
mentality
is
alive
and
well
in
the
badlands
of
rutland
water
the
nmes
praise
was
typical
of
the
albums
reception
as
progressed
kasabian
would
score
a
further
two
hits
processed
beats
and
cutt
off
and
embark
upon
a
wellreceived
uk
tour
we
take
our
music
seriously
definitely
but
we
want
to
have
fun
with
it
said
pizzorno
this
is
not
a
job
to
us
added
meighan
this
is
the
best
life
we
could
ever
have
this
is
what
its
all
about
and
without
it
wed
be
lost
souls
but
music
needs
us
as
well
