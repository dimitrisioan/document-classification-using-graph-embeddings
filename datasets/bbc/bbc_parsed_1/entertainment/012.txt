to
revive
theatre
hollywood
film
star
liam
neeson
has
held
a
dinner
party
in
new
york
to
promote
belfasts
lyric
theatre
the
ballymenaborn
actor
said
that
the
theatre
on
ridgeway
street
was
in
a
very
dilapidated
condition
lyric
chairman
david
johnston
has
said
that
rebuilding
the
theatre
at
a
cost
of
â£m
is
the
only
answer
mr
neeson
said
that
the
idea
was
to
get
a
bunch
of
healthy
wealthy
irish
americans
in
one
room
and
ask
them
to
help
with
fundraising
the
oscarnominated
actor
whose
films
include
schindlers
list
michael
collins
and
star
wars
the
phantom
menace
said
the
lyric
is
too
important
to
the
cultural
and
social
life
of
northern
ireland
for
this
building
to
crumble
and
fall
apart
it
gave
me
a
start
professionally
mary
omalley
the
founder
of
the
theatre
gave
me
my
future
in
those
days
in
the
mids
when
i
was
there
we
were
doing
a
play
every
four
weeks
belfast
was
not
a
pretty
town
to
be
living
in
there
was
serious
trouble
as
you
know
but
this
theatre
was
like
a
belisha
beacon
of
light
and
hope
six
nights
a
week
doing
everything
from
shakespeare
to
yeats
to
ocasey
with
a
group
of
actors
and
actresses
that
affected
me
very
deeply
and
still
do
the
lyric
began
years
ago
but
the
doors
opened
at
its
present
site
on
the
stranmillis
embankment
overlooking
the
river
lagan
in
as
well
as
liam
neeson
it
also
launched
the
careers
of
adrian
dunbar
and
stephen
rea
and
playwrights
such
as
martin
lynch
and
gary
mitchell
speaking
to
bbc
northern
ireland
before
the
event
at
new
yorks
soho
house
mr
neeson
said
that
his
spirit
belonged
to
the
glens
of
antrim
and
he
said
that
there
was
one
figure
from
his
childhood
that
he
would
love
to
portray
on
the
big
screen
ian
paisley
he
said
that
the
dup
leader
and
preacher
was
a
very
dynamic
extraordinary
figure
neeson
used
to
listen
to
his
sermons
on
a
friday
night
in
ballymena
he
said
what
an
orator
he
was
from
that
old
school
of
biblethumping
righteousness
but
it
was
so
dramatic
i
found
him
very
powerful
id
love
to
get
a
chance
to
play
him
some
time
