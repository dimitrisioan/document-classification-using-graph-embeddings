trio
of

crowns
a
year
of
huge
success
for

the

below
has
been
critically
acclaimed
since
its
release
and
sold
in
large
quantities
around
the
world
the
double
album
which
saw
the
pair
produce
one
disc
each
topped
the
charts
in
the
us
at
the
same
time
as

it

spot
the
georgia
pairs
year
of
critical
and
commercial
triumph
leaves
them
with
a
tough
act
to
follow
what
can
be
next
for
a
musical
act
that
has
done
it
all
g
money
a
presenter
on
the
bbcs
urban
music
station
xtra
thinks
a
hiatus
is
inevitable
after
such
a
sustained
period
of
exposure
giving
the
band
time
to
think
about
other
interests
they
might
be
more
appearances
outside
the
band
such
as
producing
for
other
artists
while
they
have
a
number
of
fringe
music
projects
andre
would
like
to
go
into
acting
so
we
might
see
him
a
film
while
big
boi
already
has
a
dogbreeding
business
says
the
dj
but
in
a
couple
of
years
they
will
be
back
with
another
album
which
will
be
a
collaboration
unlike
their
double
cd
their
greatness
has
become
clear
with
speakerboxxxthe
love
below
we
havent
seen
the
last
of
them
he
adds
outkasts
musical
career
spans
years
and
they
have
enjoyed
commercial
and
critical
success
in
the
past
with
their
debut
southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
going
platinum
but
it
took
until
for
the
pair
to
score
their
first
hit
in
the
uk
with
ms
jackson
while
their
album
stakonia
saw
their
fame
spread
beyond
the
us
xtras
g
money
says
it
took
the
latest
album
released
in
for
him
to
be
assured
of
their
genius
they
have
always
been
experimental
some
of
it
has
worked
and
some
hasnt
he
adds
but
g
money
acknowledges
that
making
the
next
move
for
a
band
that
has
reached
a
pinnacle
can
be
tough
what
can
you
do
next
when
youve
done
it
all
he
says
with
ten
years
of
success
behind
them
and
worldwide
fame
it
seems
that
outkast
is
not
a
name
that
is
likely
to
be
forgotten
in
a
hurry
