roundabout
continues
nostalgia
trip
the
new
bigscreen
version
of
the
magic
roundabout
released
in
the
uk
on
friday
is
the
latest
attempt
to
turn
childrens
television
into
boxoffice
gold
recent
years
have
seen
a
lessthansuccessful
adaptation
of
the
s
puppet
show
thunderbirds
and
a
moderately
successful
version
of
e
nesbits
five
children
and
it
previously
filmed
by
the
bbc
in
heman
and
transformers
which
were
cartoon
favourites
in
the
s
will
soon
receive
their
own
costly
makeovers
with
screen
versions
of
the
ateam
the
dukes
of
hazzard
and
even
blakes
seven
on
the
cards
nostalgia
is
clearly
big
business
but
some
critics
complain
that
these
expensive
takes
on
iconic
series
of
yesteryear
do
not
match
up
to
our
fond
memories
of
the
originals
the
new
version
of
the
magic
roundabout
which
will
be
released
as
sprung
in
the
us
replaces
the
stopmotion
models
of
the
s
tv
show
with
polished
computergenerated
animation
in
a
similar
fashion
the
thunderbirds
used
human
actors
and
special
effects
in
place
of
the
originals
puppets
and
models
the
films
are
squarely
pitched
at
younger
audiences
pop
stars
robbie
williams
and
kylie
minogue
provide
voices
in
the
magic
roundabout
while
the
nowdefunct
boy
band
busted
performed
the
thunderbirds
theme
song
but
while
some
reviewers
have
been
won
over
there
has
nonetheless
been
a
significant
backlash
this
cganimated
adventure
airbrushes
the
sly
charm
and
trippy
otherworldliness
which
made
the
s
stopmotion
roundabout
a
cult
hit
writes
stella
papamichael
on
the
bbc
movies
site
and
the
recent
puppet
comedy
team
america
world
police
was
in
part
provoked
by
its
directors
outrage
that
gerry
andersons
thunderbirds
was
remade
without
its
signature
mannequins
dan
jolin
reviews
editor
of
empire
magazine
says
classic
childrens
tv
shows
have
a
builtin
audience
that
make
them
ideal
for
reinvention
i
can
understand
why
people
are
taking
these
intellectual
properties
and
repackaging
them
for
the
kids
of
today
but
i
think
its
backfiring
whats
next
the
clangers
on
some
distant
planet
with
some
giant
cgi
soup
dragons
chasing
after
them
despite
thunderbirds
disappointing
global
boxoffice
performance
the
film
cost
m
â£m
but
only
recouped
m
â£m
the
nostalgia
craze
shows
no
signs
of
abating
it
can
therefore
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
some
other
tv
favourites
receive
the
hollywood
treatment
after
the
success
of
garfield
the
movie
britains
shabby
tabby
surely
deserves
his
own
film
vehicle
with
only
episodes
made
of
the
series
there
is
plenty
of
room
to
explore
the
lives
of
the
pink
cat
professor
yaffle
and
the
mice
of
the
marvellous
mechanical
mouse
organ
furry
recyclers
have
already
had
one
bigscreen
outing
s
wombling
free
but
with
environmental
issues
still
occupying
our
thoughts
it
is
high
time
they
made
a
comeback
advances
in
special
effects
technology
could
do
wonders
for
the
bbcs
supernatural
comedy
and
the
success
of
pirates
of
the
caribbean
must
surely
herald
a
comeback
for
tvs
most
popular
cartoon
buccaneer
it
might
also
remind
viewers
the
lewd
character
names
often
associated
with
the
show
never
actually
existed
the
magic
roundabout
is
out
in
the
uk
on
february
how
about
bringing
catweazle
to
the
big
screen
he
could
give
gandalf
a
run
for
his
money
thundercats
i
loved
it
should
be
fun
to
see
on
the
big
screen
if
some
effort
is
put
in
it
will
bring
my
youth
back
get
your
hands
off
the
clangers
is
nothing
sacred
make
a
movie
version
of
the
banana
splits
what
about
keanu
reeves
and
richard
gere
in
a
remake
of
the
wooden
tops
or
perhaps
robbie
williams
could
get
his
much
mooted
acting
career
off
the
ground
by
taking
on
the
role
of
andy
pandy
you
forgot
to
mention
the
grearest
of
them
all
danger
mouse
but
then
again
it
couldnt
be
better
than
the
original
series
could
it
its
always
nice
to
see
these
old
toons
rereleased
but
after
the
abysmal
thunderbirds
movie
and
the
song
i
think
ive
been
completely
put
off
just
leave
these
classics
alone
as
good
memories
i
think
remakes
are
a
good
idea
as
the
world
moves
on
people
tend
to
look
more
and
more
into
the
past
to
things
that
make
them
feel
safe
i
believe
this
is
the
whole
reason
retro
has
become
so
popular
as
long
as
a
remake
does
justice
to
the
original
then
all
it
can
do
is
create
a
wider
audience
and
possibly
entice
a
new
generation
of
persons
to
enjoy
and
revive
and
old
series
personally
id
like
to
see
cartoons
such
as
transformers
thundercats
and
mask
get
full
hollywood
remakes
leave
them
alone
why
ruin
something
that
we
all
have
very
fond
memories
of
in
the
first
place
the
thunderbirds
film
was
apalling
not
a
patch
on
the
puppet
series
i
grew
up
with
and
the
magic
roundabout
will
never
be
the
same
without
the
voice
of
eric
thompson
love
to
see
transformers
with
real
actors
and
cgi
and
make
it
at
least
a
rating
part
of
the
reason
for
the
success
of
such
classics
as
the
magic
roundabout
was
that
the
characters
were
not
the
sweet
and
cuddly
creatures
that
you
would
expect
they
were
moody
sarcastic
and
rather
human
just
looking
at
the
pictures
of
the
animations
for
the
new
film
show
that
these
characteristics
have
not
been
preserved
dougal
never
smiled
like
that
films
of
this
sort
have
an
unfortunate
habit
of
disneyfying
everthing
and
they
just
lose
the
real
magic
that
made
the
show
special
in
the
first
place
i
have
fond
memories
of
bod
not
least
of
which
because
i
look
like
him
and
would
like
to
see
someone
attempt
to
make
it
into
a
film
its
got
all
the
right
material
for
an
american
blockbuster
no
plot
and
no
story
bod
would
likely
be
played
by
tom
cruise
and
would
undoubtedly
have
a
girlfriend
or
two
its
all
very
well
and
good
remaking
these
classic
tv
shows
and
films
with
all
the
latest
technology
for
a
new
audience
but
for
me
a
lot
of
the
original
charm
is
lost
when
they
do
this
and
seems
more
like
a
money
making
exercise
to
cash
in
on
the
original
success
of
the
programme
than
reinventing
or
improving
it
it
maybe
that
to
an
audience
who
have
never
seen
the
originals
they
can
watch
them
without
prejudice
but
to
people
who
have
grown
up
with
all
these
shows
such
as
thunderbirds
and
magic
roundabout
which
are
part
of
our
childhood
they
are
never
going
to
live
up
to
expectation
it
does
pose
the
question
though
that
with
all
the
long
line
of
remakes
being
made
are
filmmakers
running
out
of
original
ideas
all
i
can
say
is
bring
back
danger
mouse
probably
the
greatest
kids
show
ever
i
recently
rewatched
some
episodes
and
realised
that
there
was
a
level
of
humour
shown
in
danger
mouse
that
was
completely
lost
on
me
when
i
was
a
child
there
was
a
new
captain
pugwash
cartoon
made
a
couple
of
years
back
again
like
so
many
of
these
nostalgia
programmes
the
animation
this
time
computer
created
flatcell
like
animation
failed
to
match
the
originals
cut
out
paper
technique
for
inventiveness
and
was
woefully
inadequate
we
live
in
a
sampling
world
the
music
industry
has
been
pludering
past
decades
for
inspiration
clipping
sounds
from
years
ago
is
much
cheaper
and
easier
that
doing
something
new
seems
that
the
film
and
tv
is
doing
the
same
now
its
just
cheaper
to
take
ideas
from
the
past
and
rework
them
rather
than
being
daring
and
trying
something
new
it
got
to
be
mrbenn
the
story
line
about
a
man
who
changes
in
a
fancy
dress
shop
steps
into
a
door
way
and
appears
in
another
time
and
place
would
be
amazing
if
they
got
a
decent
producer
and
writer
the
story
line
could
be
great
and
who
to
play
the
lead
role
well
if
it
was
a
comedy
then
it
would
have
to
be
someone
like
steve
martin
if
its
going
to
be
an
adventure
then
johnny
depp
playing
a
role
similar
to
the
pirates
of
the
caribbean
character
muffin
the
mule
perhaps
after
all
grannies
and
grandpas
go
to
the
cinema
as
well
you
know
why
cant
the
british
film
industry
try
making
gerry
andersons
ufo
or
captain
scarlet
or
saphire
and
steel
or
the
tomorrow
people
in
todays
media
it
seems
the
past
is
the
future
tv
shows
such
as
battlestar
galactica
have
new
remakes
djs
are
sampling
or
reworking
s
and
s
music
even
computer
games
from
years
ago
are
getting
modern
reworkings
personally
i
think
it
shows
that
no
one
has
any
originality
any
more
why
not
just
leave
our
mistyeyed
nostalgia
alone
mary
mungo
and
midge
but
of
course
for
most
of
the
episodes
the
lift
would
be
out
of
order
and
they
would
have
to
use
the
stairs
plus
would
mary
be
more
of
a
vicky
pollard
character
as
she
lives
in
a
high
rise
council
block
yeah
but
no
but
i
wasnt
even
there
id
like
to
see
mr
benn
with
brad
pitt
in
the
title
role
sean
connery
could
play
the
mysterious
costume
shop
owner
it
demonstrates
a
profound
lack
of
imagination
in
todays
filmmakers
that
they
continually
try
to
remake
and
remodel
the
past
in
an
effort
to
cash
in
on
nostalgia
there
are
plany
of
modern
childrens
book
that
would
make
excellent
films
or
tv
programmes
why
not
use
them
instead
of
rehashing
the
past
mr
benn
with
rowan
atkinson
as
the
lead
would
have
loved
to
see
dungeons
dragons
made
but
unfortunately
the
film
that
it
was
made
into
didnt
come
up
to
scratch
the
only
one
that
isnt
to
be
remade
as
yet
is
thundercats
which
id
like
to
see
im
an
expat
living
in
norway
and
i
recently
went
through
a
period
of
buying
the
dvds
of
many
of
my
favourite
childrens
programs
for
my
daughters
my
dearest
wish
however
is
to
see
a
feature
length
version
of
noggin
the
nog
appear
on
the
big
screen
very
scandinavian
rainbow
i
believe
that
childrens
classics
should
be
left
well
alone
and
i
will
not
be
surprised
if
the
magic
roundabout
does
not
do
well
at
the
box
office
especially
since
it
will
be
going
up
against
the
spongebob
squarepants
movie
popular
among
children
because
its
original
witty
and
modern
the
magic
roundabout
will
never
appeal
to
the
children
of
today
as
it
did
all
those
many
years
ago
how
about
classics
like
chorlton
and
the
wheelies
rentaghost
terrahawks
bodoh
the
list
could
go
on
and
on
if
a
transformers
movie
is
indeed
on
the
cards
then
ill
be
the
first
one
on
amazon
buying
a
copy
eagerly
waiting
at
the
front
door
with
a
frothy
mouth
and
a
nervous
twitch
repackage
my
childhood
and
sell
it
to
me
at
an
extortionate
price
i
dont
care
till
then
ill
have
to
make
do
with
the
citreon
c
advert
id
luv
to
see
willow
the
wisp
on
the
big
screen
but
sadly
without
the
late
kenneth
williams
doing
the
voices
it
wouldnt
be
the
same
and
who
remembers
trap
door
voiced
by
the
late
willie
rushden
superb
childrens
programme
could
morph
hold
his
own
in
a
big
screen
movie
or
even
jamie
and
the
magic
torchhmmmmm
i
could
go
on
and
on
danger
mouse
at
im
showing
my
age
noggin
the
nog
was
one
of
the
best
childrens
programs
the
problem
with
bringing
it
to
the
big
screen
is
that
noone
could
approach
oliver
postgates
wonderful
voices
so
in
general
leave
well
alone
the
originals
are
good
because
they
are
of
their
time
and
the
methods
used
are
an
integral
part
of
the
story
just
imagine
what
could
be
achieved
by
using
cgi
in
a
remake
of
fingerbobs
the
already
disturbing
hand
antics
of
the
bearded
hippy
yoffi
could
take
on
a
whole
new
level
with
a
more
lifelike
fingermouse
bob
the
builder
postman
pat
and
fireman
sam
together
in
an
epic
adventure
of
fire
post
and
bricks
in
the
ultimate
struggle
to
save
the
women
they
love
from
the
evil
clowns
krusty
and
gobo
will
they
triumph
or
will
they
fail
miserably
find
out
this
fall
one
puppet
show
that
i
personally
would
love
to
see
made
into
a
live
action
movie
is
joe
it
would
be
worth
the
price
of
admission
alone
to
see
the
large
screen
version
of
joes
car
of
course
gerry
andersons
supermarionation
is
a
rich
seam
of
material
worthy
of
bigscreen
bigbudget
action
it
was
only
that
thunderbirds
the
movie
was
targetted
as
a
childrent
movie
that
really
let
it
down
after
all
the
children
that
remember
those
shows
with
such
affection
are
now
the
parents
of
children
themselves
its
only
because
the
people
who
were
children
when
these
programmes
were
first
shown
have
grown
up
and
are
plundering
their
childhoods
isnt
it
id
hate
to
see
bagpuss
with
perfect
animation
i
love
that
done
in
a
shed
clunkiness
and
you
couldnt
recreate
the
magic
perhaps
if
the
remakes
were
done
in
a
look
around
you
mockauthentic
style
i
might
be
interested
chorton
and
the
wheelies
or
jamie
and
his
magic
torch
that
would
be
mega
this
regurgitation
of
old
films
and
tv
shows
makes
me
angry
it
is
corporate
laziness
resting
on
the
safety
of
other
peoples
ideas
because
it
guarantees
to
bring
in
the
the
same
can
be
said
of
modern
day
pop
bands
who
release
other
peoples
material
will
young
etc
the
sad
fact
is
nostalgia
sells
big
bucks
in
the
shortterm
the
fact
that
they
will
be
forgotten
in
months
time
is
irrelevant
eg
starsky
hutch
hence
the
market
is
saturated
with
this
mindless
drivel
but
it
can
only
be
stopped
if
people
stop
buying
it
i
pray
they
never
do
a
remake
of
chorlton
and
the
wheelies
im
only
and
dont
remember
the
series
from
when
it
was
on
tv
but
have
the
set
on
dvd
and
its
a
classic
the
fact
its
so
great
comes
from
the
fact
that
there
were
very
few
special
effects
involved
and
compared
to
todays
stuff
it
looks
amateurish
thats
the
appeal
though
its
so
innocent
like
chorlton
himself
and
it
would
be
a
real
shame
if
they
did
remake
it
