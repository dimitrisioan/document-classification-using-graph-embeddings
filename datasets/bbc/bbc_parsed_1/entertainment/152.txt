spokesman

simon
said
the
presley
tapes
were
withdrawn

he
said
the
family
of

and
banter
between
presley
members
of
his
band
and
mr
nogar
weve
had
them
for
a
lot
of
years

we
could
use
the
money
mr
nogars
son
stephen
said

mr
nogar
who
died
in

always
used
to
make
two
tapes
of
sessions
as
a
backup
in
case
rca
producers
wanted
to
make
late
changes
to
songs
he
called
them
his
asssaver
tapes
his
son
said
the
quality
is
said
to
be
noticeably
crisper
than
that
of
a
new
vinyl
record
because
the
family
does
not
own
the
copyright
to
the

the
tapes
could
only
be
sold
for
personal
enjoyment
and
can
