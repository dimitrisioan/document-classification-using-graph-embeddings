cheaper
chip
for
mobiles
a
mobile
phone
chip
which
combines
a
modem
and
a
computer
processor
on
one
bit
of
silicon
instead
of
two
could
make
phones
cheaper
and
more
powerful
the
speciallydesigned
chip
developed
by
texas
instruments
could
drive
down
the
cost
of
making
mobiles
capable
of
d
gaming
and
frameasecond
video
currently
rich
multimedia
features
tend
to
be
on
more
expensive
handsets
the
technology
omapvox
is
being
tested
by
firms
in
europe
and
asia
and
could
appear
by
the
end
of
the
year
texas
which
makes
computer
chips
for
more
than
half
the
worlds
mobile
phones
said
it
was
keen
to
make
multimedia
functions
like
video
and
gaming
more
affordable
were
going
to
drive
them
down
into
meatandpotatoes
phones
that
have
the
largest
market
share
said
doug
rasor
a
marketing
vice
president
at
texas
the
chip
also
uses
much
less
power
than
conventional
chips
said
texas
which
means
less
strain
on
mobile
battery
life
more
than
million
people
own
a
mobile
in
the
uk
but
mobile
operators
are
keen
to
encourage
people
to
move
onto
more
sophisticated
handsets
that
can
do
more
texas
is
keen
to
cash
in
on
the
third
generation
g
of
mobile
technology
which
offers
highspeed
networks
for
video
streaming
and
other
multimedia
functions
but
it
faces
stiff
competition
from
the
likes
of
intel
which
is
also
looking
to
provide
better
chips
for
highend
mobiles
competition
to
get
people
using
g
mobiles
will
grow
in
the
next
year
as
almost
all
of
the
uks
operators
have
now
launched
third
generation
networks
a
recent
survey
by
sony
ericsson
predicted
that
the
number
of
g
handsets
sold
in
would
double
from
to
account
for
of
all
phones
sold
many
consumers
are
still
to
be
convinced
though
a
further
recent
survey
said
that
only
of
mobile
owners
were
thinking
of
upgrading
to
g
phones
many
said
they
were
confused
about
the
different
ways
to
pay
for
phones
and
the
vast
array
of
features
most
have
onboard
but
there
will
be
continued
demand
for
better
chips
as
the
industry
continues
to
develop
new
standards
and
future
networks
earlier
in
january
ntt
docomo
and
vodafone
joined
forces
to
develop
the
next
generation
of
highspeed
networks
known
as
super
g
intended
to
be
times
faster
than
g
services
the
first
stage
of
development
is
to
be
completed
by
but
no
date
has
been
set
for
a
commercial
launch
the
newlydesigned
omapvox
chip
set
was
announced
ahead
of
the
start
of
a
major
mobile
industry
conference
gsm
which
takes
place
in
cannes
france
this
week
