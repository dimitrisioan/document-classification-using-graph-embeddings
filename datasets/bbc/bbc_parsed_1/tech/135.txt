gta
sequel
is
criminally
good
the
grand
theft
auto
series
of
games
have
set
themselves
the
very
highest
of
standards
in
recent
years
but
the
newest
addition
is
more
than
able
to
live
up
to
an
increasingly
grand
tradition
the
certificate
gta
san
andreas
for
the
playstation
could
have
got
away
with
merely
revisiting
a
bestselling
formula
with
a
moreofthesame
approach
instead
it
builds
and
expands
almost
immeasurably
upon
the
last
two
games
and
stomps
carefree
over
all
the
drivr
and
true
crimeshaped
opposition
even
in
the
year
that
will
see
sequels
to
halo
and
halflife
it
is
hard
to
envisage
anything
topping
this
barnstorming
instant
classic
the
basic
gameplay
remains
familiar
you
control
a
character
on
this
occasion
a
youth
named
cj
who
sets
out
on
a
series
of
selfcontained
missions
within
a
massive
d
environment
cj
can
commandeer
any
vehicle
he
stumbles
across
from
a
pushbike
to
a
city
bus
to
a
plane
all
come
in
handy
as
he
seeks
to
establish
his
presence
in
a
tough
urban
environment
and
avenge
the
dreadful
deeds
waged
upon
his
family
to
make
things
worse
he
is
framed
for
murder
the
moment
he
arrives
in
town
and
blackmailed
by
crooked
cops
played
by
samuel
l
jackson
and
chris
penn
the
setting
for
all
this
rampant
criminality
is
the
fictional
us
state
of
san
andreas
comprising
three
major
cities
los
santos
which
is
a
thinlydisguised
los
angeles
san
fierro
aka
san
francisco
and
las
venturas
a
carbon
copy
of
las
vegas
san
andreas
sucks
you
in
with
its
sprawling
range
cast
of
characters
and
incredibly
sharp
writing
its
ability
to
capture
the
ambience
of
the
realworld
versions
of
these
cities
is
something
to
behold
assisted
no
end
by
the
monumental
graphical
advances
since
vice
city
the
streets
and
vast
swathes
of
countryside
are
by
turns
gloriously
menacing
grungy
and
preppy
flaunting
awesome
levels
of
graphical
detail
the
games
overall
look
particularly
during
the
many
unusual
weather
conditions
and
dramatic
sunsets
is
stupendous
the
outstanding
breadandbutter
gameplay
mechanics
provide
a
solid
grounding
for
the
elaborate
plot
to
hang
on
cars
handle
more
convincingly
than
ever
a
superb
motion
blur
kicks
in
when
you
hit
high
speeds
and
theres
more
traffic
to
navigate
than
before
park
your
vehicle
across
the
lanes
of
a
freeway
and
within
seconds
there
will
be
a
huge
pileup
pedestrians
are
also
out
in
force
and
are
a
loquacious
bunch
cj
can
interact
with
them
using
a
simple
system
on
the
control
pad
they
will
pass
comments
on
his
appearance
and
credibility
aspects
that
the
player
now
has
control
over
clothes
tattoos
and
haircuts
can
all
be
purchased
and
funding
these
habits
can
be
achieved
by
criminal
means
or
by
indulging
in
minigames
like
betting
on
horses
and
challenging
bar
patrons
to
games
of
pool
the
character
will
put
on
or
lose
weight
according
to
how
long
he
spends
on
foot
or
in
the
gym
he
will
have
to
pause
regularly
in
restaurants
to
keep
energy
levels
up
but
will
swell
up
as
a
result
of
overeating
and
at
last
this
is
a
gta
hero
who
can
swim
at
a
time
when
games
are
once
again
under
fire
for
their
supposed
potential
to
corrupt
the
young
san
andreas
violence
or
specifically
the
freedom
it
gives
the
player
to
commit
violence
are
sure
to
inflame
the
procensorship
brigade
developers
rockstar
have
not
shied
away
from
brutality
and
in
some
respects
ramp
it
up
from
past
outings
when
hijacking
a
car
for
example
cj
will
gratuitously
shove
the
drivers
head
into
the
steering
wheel
rather
than
just
fleeing
with
the
vehicle
indeed
the
tone
is
darker
than
the
jokey
vice
city
the
grim
subject
matter
here
hardly
lends
itself
to
gags
in
quite
the
same
way
as
the
cheesy
s
setting
of
the
last
game
this
title
incidentally
is
set
in
but
that
is
really
neither
here
nor
there
apart
from
the
influence
it
has
on
the
radio
playlists
the
wit
is
still
present
just
more
restrained
than
in
previous
outings
a
further
reason
for
this
is
that
the
incredible
range
of
invehicle
radio
stations
available
means
you
will
spend
less
time
happening
upon
the
hilarious
talk
radio
options
where
gta
games
trademark
humour
is
anchored
the
quality
of
voice
acting
and
motion
capture
is
simply
offthechart
the
games
rather
odious
gangland
lowlifes
swagger
and
mouth
off
in
a
way
that
rings
very
true
indeed
it
is
a
testament
to
san
andreas
magnificence
that
it
has
a
number
of
prominent
flaws
but
pluspoints
are
so
numerous
that
the
niggles
dont
detract
the
onscreen
map
for
instance
is
needlessly
fiddly
an
unwelcome
change
from
past
editions
there
is
also
a
very
jarring
slowdown
at
actionpacked
moments
and
the
game
suffers
from
the
ageold
problem
that
can
be
relied
upon
to
blight
all
games
of
this
genre
setting
you
back
a
vast
distance
when
you
fail
right
at
the
very
end
of
a
long
mission
but
the
gameplay
experience
in
its
entirety
is
overwhelmingly
positive
you
simply
will
not
be
bothered
by
these
minor
failings
san
andreas
is
among
the
few
unmissable
games
of
