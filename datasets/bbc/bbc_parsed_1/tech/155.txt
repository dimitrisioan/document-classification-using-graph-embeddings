games
win
for
bluray
dvd
format
the
nextgeneration
dvd
format
bluray
is
winning
more
supporters
than
its
rival
according
to
its
backers
bluray
backed
by
firms
including
sony
is
competing
against
toshiba
and
necbacked
hddvd
to
be
the
format
of
choice
for
future
films
and
games
the
bluray
association
said
on
thursday
that
games
giants
electronic
arts
and
vivendi
would
both
support
its
dvd
format
the
next
generation
of
dvds
will
hold
highdefinition
video
and
sound
this
offers
incredible
dlike
quality
of
pictures
which
major
hollywood
studios
and
games
publishers
are
extremely
keen
to
exploit
in
the
coming
year
in
a
separate
press
conference
at
the
consumer
electronics
show
in
las
vegas
toshiba
announced
that
dvd
players
for
its
technology
would
be
on
the
market
by
the
end
of
as
we
move
from
standard
definition
video
images
to
highdefinition
images
we
have
a
much
greater
need
for
storage
richard
doherty
from
panasonics
hollywood
laboratories
one
of
the
pioneers
of
bluray
told
the
bbc
news
website
so
by
utilising
blue
laserbased
technology
we
can
make
an
optical
laser
disc
that
can
hold
six
times
as
much
as
todays
dvd
a
bluray
disc
will
be
able
to
store
gb
of
highquality
data
while
toshibas
hddvd
will
hold
gb
mr
doherty
added
that
it
was
making
sure
the
discs
could
satisfy
all
highdefinition
needs
including
the
ability
to
record
onto
the
dvds
and
smaller
discs
to
fit
into
camcorders
both
toshiba
and
bluray
are
hopeful
that
the
emerging
dvd
format
war
akin
to
the
betamax
and
vhs
fight
in
the
s
can
be
resolved
over
the
next
year
when
nextgeneration
dvd
players
start
to
come
out
when
players
do
come
out
they
will
be
able
to
play
standard
dvds
too
which
is
good
news
for
those
who
have
huge
libraries
of
current
dvds
but
the
support
from
vivendi
and
electronics
arts
is
a
big
boost
to
bluray
in
the
battle
for
supremacy
gaming
is
a
billion
industry
worldwide
so
is
as
crucial
as
the
film
industry
in
terms
of
money
to
be
made
the
technical
requirement
for
game
development
today
demands
more
advanced
opticaldisc
technologies
said
michael
heilmann
chief
technology
officer
for
vivendi
universal
bluray
offers
the
capacity
performance
and
highspeed
internet
connectivity
to
take
us
into
the
future
of
gaming
ea
a
leading
games
developer
and
publisher
added
that
the
delivery
of
highdefinition
games
of
the
future
was
vital
and
bluray
had
the
capacity
functionality
and
interactivity
needed
for
the
kinds
of
projects
it
was
planning
sony
recently
announced
it
would
be
using
the
technology
in
its
next
generation
of
playstations
mr
doherty
said
gamers
were
ravenous
for
highquality
graphics
and
technology
for
the
next
generation
of
titles
gamers
especially
those
working
on
pcs
are
always
focused
on
more
capacity
to
deliver
textures
deeper
levels
for
delivering
higherresolution
playback
he
added
the
focus
for
games
moving
forward
on
increased
immersion
gaming
companies
really
like
to
focus
on
creating
a
world
which
involves
creating
complicated
d
models
and
textures
and
increasing
the
resolution
increasing
the
frame
rate
all
of
these
are
part
of
getting
a
more
immersive
experience
fitting
these
models
on
current
dvd
technologies
means
compressing
the
graphics
so
much
that
much
of
this
quality
is
lost
as
games
move
to
more
photoreal
capability
the
current
technology
is
limiting
they
are
thrilled
at
the
advanced
capacity
to
start
to
build
these
immersive
environments
said
mr
doherty
currently
graphicsintensive
pc
games
also
require
multiple
discs
for
installation
highdefinition
dvds
will
cut
down
on
that
need
likewise
consoles
rely
on
single
discs
so
dvds
that
can
hold
six
times
more
data
mean
much
better
highresolution
games
bluray
has
already
won
backing
from
major
hollywood
studios
such
as
mgm
studios
disney
and
buena
vista
as
well
as
top
technology
firms
like
dell
lg
samsung
and
phillips
amongst
others
while
toshibas
hddvd
technology
has
won
backing
from
paramount
universal
and
warner
bros
the
real
world
benefits
of
hddvd
are
apparent
and
obvious
said
jim
cardwell
president
of
warner
home
video
mr
cardwell
added
that
rapid
time
to
market
and
dependability
were
significant
factors
in
choosing
to
go
with
hddvd
both
formats
are
courting
microsoft
to
be
the
format
of
choice
for
the
next
generation
xbox
but
discussions
are
still
ongoing
next
generation
dvds
will
also
be
able
to
store
images
and
other
data
ces
is
the
largest
consumer
electronics
show
in
the
world
and
runs
from
to
january
