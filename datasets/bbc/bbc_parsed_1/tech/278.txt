google
released
free
software
for
organising
and
finding
digital
photos
stored
on
a
computers
hard
drive
the
tool
called
picasa
automatically
detects
photos
as
they
are
added
to
a
pc
whether
sent
via
email
or
transferred
from
a
digital
camera
the
software
includes
tools
for

colour
and
removing
red
eye
as
well
as
sharpening
images
photos
can
then
be
uploaded
to
sites
such
as
ofoto
many
people
use
the
sites
to
edit
and
improve
their
favourite
photographs
before
ordering
prints
mr
hawkins
added
the
growth
area
is
that
you
can
order
your
prints
online
friends
and
family
can
also
access
pictures
you
want
them
to
see
and
they
can
print
them
out
too
rather
than
just
a
place
to
dump
your
pictures
its
about
sharing
them
the
vast
majority
of
pictures
remain
on
a
pcs
hard
drive
which
is
why
search
tools
such
as
those
offered
by
google
become
increasingly
important
but
some
historians
and
archivists
are
concerned
that
the
need
for
perfect
pictures
will
mean
that
those
poor
quality
prints
which
offered
a
tantilising
glimpse
of
the
past
may
disappear
forever
its
one
thing
taking
pictures
its
another
finding
them
said
mr
hawkins
but
this
is
the
same
problem
that
has
always
existed
how
many
of
us
have
photos
in
wallets
tucked
away
somewhere
