flic
everett
journalist
and
dating
expert
for
company
magazine
and
the
daily
express
thinks
technology
has
been
liberating
for
some
nervous
soulmate
seekers
there
are
currently
about
million
video
phones
in
use
in
the
uk
and
three
times
more
single
people
in
britain
than
there
were
years
ago
with
more
people
buying
video
mobiles
g
dating
could
be
the
basis
for
a
successful
and
safe
way
to
meet
people
one
of
the
problems
with
video
phones
is
people
dont
really
know
what
to
video
it
is
a
weird
technology
we
have
not
quite
worked
out
what
it
is
for
this
gives
it
a
focus
and
a
useful
one
she
told
bbc
news
i
would
never
have
thought
online
dating
would
take
off
the
way
it
did
she
said
lots
of
people
find
it
easier
to
be
honest
writing
email
or
text
than
facetoface
lots
people
are
quite
shy
and
they
feel
vulnerable
when
you
are
writing
it
comes
directly
onto
the
page
so
they
tend
to
be
more
honest
but
the
barrier
that
comes
with
sms
chat
and
online
matchmaking
is
that
the
person
behind
the
profile
may
not
be
who
they
really
are
scare
stories
have
put
people
off
as
a
result
according
to
ms
everett
many
physical
clues
body
language
odd
twitches
are
obviously
missing
with
sms
and
online
dating
services
still
images
do
not
necessarily
provide
all
those
necessary
cues
it
could
really
take
off
because
you
do
get
the
whole
package
with
a
static
email
picture
you
dont
know
who
the
person
is
behind
it
is
so
checking
out
a
potential
date
by
video
phone
also
gives
singletons
a
different
kind
of
barrier
an
extra
layer
of
protection
a
case
of
wlts
before
wltm
if
you
are
trapped
in
reallife
blind
date
context
you
cant
get
away
and
you
feel
embarrassed
with
a
video
meeting
you
really
have
the
barrier
of
the
phone
so
if
you
dont
like
them
you
dont
have
to
suffer
the
embarrassment
there
is
a
more
serious
side
to
this
new
use
of
technology
though
with
money
being
made
through
more
adultthemes
content
and
services
which
let
people
meet
and
chat
the
revenue
streams
for
mobile
carriers
will
grow
with
g
thinks
paolo

specialist
for
analysts
idc
wireless
is
a
medium
that
is
being
exploited
with
a
number
of
features
and
services
one
is
chatting
and
the
dating
element
is
key
there
he
said
the
foundation
has
been
set
by
sms
and
companies
are
using
media
like
mms
and
video
to
grow
the
market
further
but
carriers
need
to
be
wary
and
ensure
that
if
they
do
launch
such
g
dating
services
they
ensure
mechanism
are
in
place
to
monitor
and
be
aware
who
is
registers
and
accesses
these
services
on
regular
basis
he
cautioned
in
july
vodafone
introduced
a
content
control
system
to
protect
children
from
such
adult
content
the
move
was
as
a
result
of
a
code
of
practice
agreed
by
the
uks
six
largest
mobile
phone
operators
in
january
the
system
means
vodafone
users
need
to
prove
they
are
over
before
firewalls
are
lifted
on
explicit
websites
or
chat
rooms
dealing
with
adult
themes
the
impetus
was
the
growing
number
of
people
with
handsets
that
could
access
the
net
and
the
growth
of
g
technologies
