twothirds
of
the
worlds
population
billion
people
live
on
a
year
or
less
you
might
think
that
the
last
thing
on
their
minds
would
be
getting
a
television
set
or
a
computer
but
thats
not
the
case
many
people
in
the
developing
world
give
up
one
of
their
daily
meals
so
they
can
afford
to
buy
a
tv
and
now
an
indianborn
computer
engineer
thinks
hes
come
up
with
a
way
to
give
them
cheap
access
to
the
internet
carnegie
mellon
professor
raj
reddy
has
spent
the
bulk
of
his
professional
career
trying
to
find
ways
to
make
technology
accessible
to
poor
people
the
first
step
is
to
figure
out
why
poor
people
would
want
a
personal
computer
and
professor
reddy
thinks
he
has
a
pretty
good
idea
of
why
they
might
i
come
from
a
village
says
prof
reddy
i
know
what
the
population
is
like
many
of
them
are
illiterate
and
many
of
them
have
other
concerns
there
nobody
will
use
it
for
the
conventional
uses
of
a
pc
word
processing
and
powerpoint
he
said
so
its
clear
to
me
that
if
people
wanted
to
use
pcs
in
a
village
it
has
to
usable
by
illiterate
people
and
it
must
be
primarily
for
entertainment
education
telemedicine
and
access
to
expert
advice
prof
reddy
also
thinks
that
tying
it
into
some
kind
of
aid
package
was
the
wrong
approach
after
all
he
asked
what
aid
group
could
possibly
give
expensive
computers
to
million
less
fortunate
indians
let
alone
the
billions
of
poor
people
around
the
world
instead
prof
reddy
decided
to
think
of
those
million
indians
as
a
potential
market
the
problem
then
becomes
one
of
making
the
product
compelling
enough
it
must
be
so
compelling
that
you
would
give
up
your
third
meal
in
order
to
have
this
prof
reddy
says
people
do
this
today
with
television
sets
if
you
go
to
india
and
many
other
countries
they
will
first
go
get
a
television
set
before
they
worry
about
one
more
meal
why
because
personalized
entertainment
has
become
very
important
this
hatched
a
completely
new
idea
he
calls
it
a
pctvt
a
personal
computer
television
and
telephone
all
in
one
that
runs
on
a
normal
desktop
machine
literate
users
can
surf
through
the
applications
with
a
keyboard
and
mouse
but
illiterate
users
can
use
what
looks
like
a
television
remote
control
on
the
screen
pictures
not
words
designate
applications
like
tv
voice
mail
and
video
email
this
dependence
on
graphics
video
and
audio
means
that
a
computer
for
an
illiterate
person
needs
times
more
power
and
more
memory
than
one
for
a
phd
prassana
rambathla
one
of
prof
reddys
graduate
students
says
that
when
youre
talking
illiterate
youre
talking
audio
and
video
and
that
demands
exponentially
high
bandwidth
it
cant
choke
at
any
point
in
time
and
it
has
to
withstand
anything
no
matter
what
youre
pressing
the
major
part
is
making
it
foolproof
very
tough
so
that
it
never
breaks
he
says
the
carnegie
mellon
team
says
this
project
is
only
possible
because
pcs
are
now
so
much
cheaper
and
have
builtin
audio
and
video
hardware
and
software
limited
trials
of
the
pctvt
are
due
to
start
this
month
in
the
indian
state
of
andhra
pradesh
although
andhra
pradesh
has
a
fairly
good
infrastructure
but
work
has
to
be
done
to
ensure
reliable
connections
to
the
net
prof
reddy
has
teamed
up
with
eric
brewer
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
the
answer
says
prof
brewer
is
wifi
were
looking
at
the
thing
youll
see
in
starbucks
or
many
other
hotspots
he
says
were
doing
a
lot
of
work
on
longdistance
wireless
and
how
to
make
the
network
work
better
in
the
presence
of
intermittency
when
the
power
goes
up
and
down
and
the
links
go
up
and
down
and
the
computers
youre
connected
to
just
get
turned
off
for
no
reason
prof
reddy
says
he
hopes
to
lease
the
pctvts
for
about
a
month
and
thinks
indians
will
rent
the
units
for
the
television
and
dvd
capabilities
reddy
says
he
can
then
introduce
the
pctvts
other
technologies
such
as
video
mail
for
example
a
farmer
could
use
the
pctvts
webcam
to
send
a
picture
of
a
harmful
insect
to
a
local
official
who
could
send
back
a
proposed
course
of
action
to
the
farmer
prof
reddy
thinks
this
kind
of
communication
is
the
real
payoff
the
underlying
problem
he
says
is
how
you
can
increase
their
wealth
and
reduce
their
poverty
and
reduce
their
illiteracy
and
improve
their
health
care
and
what
im
postulating
is
that
this
is
the
technology
that
will
enable
them
if
i
didnt
have
it
it
would
be
an
uphill
battle
even
with
the
technology
its
an
uphill
battle
but
i
have
a
tool
there
is
hope
i
can
reach
them
in
ways
that
have
not
been
possible
