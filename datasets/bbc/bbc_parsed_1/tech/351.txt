the

and
the
us
at
the
end
of
nintendo
has
sold
almost
m
ds
consoles
part
of
this

buy
a
ds
we
know
that
customers
want
it
as
soon
as
its
released
and
that
means
the
minute
not
the
day
said
robert
quinn
games
uk
sales
director
but
nintendo
will
only
have
sole
control
of
europes
handheld
gaming
market
for
a
few
weeks
because
soon
sony
is
expected
to
release
its
psp
console
although
nintendo
is
aiming
for
younger
players
and
the
psp
is
more
for
older
gamers
it
is
likely
that
the
two
firms
will
be
competing
for
many
of
the
same
customers
sonys
psp
represents
a
real
threat
to
nintendo
because
of
the
huge
number
of
playstation
owners
around
the
world
and
the
greater
flexibility
of
the
sleek
black
gadget
the
psp
uses
small
discs
for
games
can
play
music
and
movies
without
the
need
for
addons
and
also
supports
shortrange
wireless
play
when
it
goes
on
sale
the
psp
is
likely
to
cost
between
â£
and
