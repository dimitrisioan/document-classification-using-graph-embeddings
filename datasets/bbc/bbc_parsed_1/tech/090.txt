web
radio
takes
spanish
rap
global
spin
the
radio
dial
in
the
us
and
you
are
likely
to
find
plenty
of
spanishlanguage
music
but
what
you
will
not
find
is
much
spanishlanguage
hiphop
hiphop
and
rap
are
actually
quite
popular
in
the
spanishspeaking
world
but
local
artists
are
having
trouble
marketing
their
work
abroad
but
now
a
us
company
is
bringing
rap
and
hiphop
en
espanol
to
computer
users
everywhere
los
caballeros
de
plan
g
are
one
of
mexicos
hottest
hiphop
acts
they
have
a
devoted
fan
base
in
their
native
monterrey
but
most
mexican
hiphop
fans
not
to
mention
fans
in
most
of
the
spanishspeaking
world
rarely
get
a
chance
to
hear
the
groups
tracks
on
the
radio
you
cant
really
just
go
on
the
radio
and
listen
to
hiphop
in
spanish
its
just
not
accessible
says
manuel
millan
a
native
of
san
diego
california
its
really
hard
for
the
spanish
hiphop
scene
to
get
into
mainstream
radio
you
usually
have
a
very
commercialised
sound
and
the
groups
are
not
really
known
around
the
country
or
around
the
world
millan
and
two
friends
set
out
to
change
that
they
wanted
to
make
groups
like
los
caballeros
de
plan
g
accessible
to
fans
globally
mainstream
radio
stations
were
not
going
to
play
this
kind
of
music
and
starting
their
own
broadcast
station
was
economically
impossible
so
millan
and
his
friends
launched
a
website
called
latinohiphopradiocom
the
name
says
it
all
it
is
webbased
radio
devoted
to
the
hottest
spanish
language
rap
and
hiphop
tracks
the
site
which
is
in
both
in
english
and
spanish
is
meant
to
be
easy
to
navigate
all
the
user
has
to
do
is
download
a
media
player
there
are
no
djs
it
is
just
music
streamed
over
the
net
for
free
suddenly
with
the
help
of
the
website
los
caballeros
de
plan
g
are
producing
export
quality
rap
the
web
might
be
just
the
right
medium
for
spanish
language
hiphop
right
now
the
genre
is
in
what
millan
calls
its
infant
stage
but
the
production
values
are
improving
and
artists
such
as
argentinas
mustafa
yoda
are
pushing
to
make
it
better
and
better
mustafa
yoda
is
currently
one
of
the
hottest
tracks
on
latinohiphopradiocom
hes
considered
the
eminem
of
argentina
and
the
latin
american
hiphop
scene
millan
says
he
really
hasnt
had
that
much
exposure
as
far
as
anywhere
in
the
world
but
hes
definitely
the
one
to
look
out
for
as
far
as
becoming
the
next
big
thing
in
the
spanishspeaking
world
currently
the
chilean
group
makisa
is
also
in
latinohiphopradiocoms
top
as
is
cuban
artist
papo
record
every
countrys
got
its
own
cultural
differences
and
they
try
to
put
those
into
their
own
songs
millan
says
latinohiphopradiocom
has
been
up
and
running
for
a
couple
of
months
now
the
site
has
listeners
from
across
the
spanish
speaking
world
right
now
mexico
leads
the
way
accounting
for
about
of
listeners
but
web
surfers
in
spain
are
logging
in
as
well
about
of
the
web
stations
traffic
comes
from
there
that
is
not
surprising
as
many
consider
spain
to
be
the
leader
in
spanishlanguage
rap
and
hiphop
millan
says
that
spain
is
actually
just
behind
the
united
states
and
france
in
terms
of
overall
rap
and
hiphop
production
that
might
be
changing
though
as
more
and
more
latin
american
artists
are
finding
audiences
but
one
spaniard
is
still
firmly
in
latinohiphopradiocoms
top
his
name
is
tote
king
and
manuel
millan
says
that
he
is
the
hiphop
leader
in
spain
on
his
track
uno
contra
veinte
emcees
or
one
against
emcees
tote
king
shows
he
is
well
aware
of
that
fact
its
basically
him
bragging
that
hes
one
of
the
best
emcees
in
spain
right
now
millan
says
and
its
pretty
much
true
he
has
the
tightest
productions
and
his
rap
flow
is
impeccable
its
amazing
latinohiphopradiocom
is
hoping
to
expand
in
the
coming
year
millan
says
they
want
to
include
more
music
and
more
news
from
the
world
of
spanish
language
hiphop
and
rap
