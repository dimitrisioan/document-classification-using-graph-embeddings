according
to
john
houlihan
editor
of
the
computerandvideogamescom
magazine
its
a
very
very
competitive
price
point
there
are
some
innovative
features
and
nintendo
has
created
quite
a
buzz
he
says
however
the
lineup
of
games
could
have
been
stronger
everyone
wanted
to
see
the
eightplayer
mario
kart
ds
for
example
mr
houlihan
believes
that
there
is
likely
to
be
an
audience
for
both
the
nintendo
ds
and
sonys
new
psp
with
the
former
aimed
largely
at
a
younger
audience
and
the
latter
expected
to
be
marketed
as
a
multimedia
device
the
psp
is
a
sexy
bit
of
kit
but
sonys
attitude
to
the
psp
has
been
very
understated
in
europe
so
far
mr
houlihan
said
the
worldwide
handheld
software
market
had
an
estimated
worth
of
bn
at
the

to
industry
analysts

past
games
consoles
and
handhelds
have
generally
launched
much
later

europe
than
in
other
parts

world
however
nintendo
president
satoru
iwata
said
the
company
was
pleased
to
have
offered
such
a
short
period
of
time
between
the
us
and
european
launch
europe
is
an
extremely
important
market
for
nintendo
mr
iwata
added
nintendo
raised
its
sales
targets
for
the
ds
console
last
december
after
selling
a
million

us
and
japan
in
