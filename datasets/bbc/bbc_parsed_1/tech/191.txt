online
commons
to
spark
debate
online
communities
set
up
by
the
uk
government
could
encourage
public
debate
and
build
trust
says
the
institute
of
public
policy
research
ippr
existing
services
such
as
ebay
could
provide
a
good
blueprint
for
such
services
says
the
thinktank
although
the
net
is
becoming
part
of
local
and
central
government
its
potential
has
not
yet
been
fully
exploited
to
create
an
online
commons
for
public
debate
in
its
report
is
online
community
a
policy
tool
the
ippr
also
asks
if
id
cards
could
help
create
safer
online
communities
adopting
an
ebaytype
model
would
let
communities
create
their
own
markets
for
skills
and
services
and
help
foster
a
sense
of
local
identity
and
connection
what
we
are
proposing
is
a
civic
commons
will
davies
senior
research
fellow
at
the
ippr
told
the
bbc
news
website
a
single
publicly
funded
and
run
online
community
in
which
citizens
can
have
a
single
place
to
go
where
you
can
go
to
engage
in
diversity
and
in
a
way
that
might
have
a
policy
implication
like
a
prelegislation
discussion
the
idea
of
a
civic
commons
was
originally
proposed
by
stephen
coleman
professor
of
edemocracy
at
the
oxford
internet
institute
the
ippr
report
points
to
informal
small
scale
examples
of
such
commons
that
already
exist
it
mentions
goodpractice
public
initiatives
like
the
bbcs
ican
project
which
connects
people
locally
and
nationally
who
want
to
take
action
around
important
issues
but
he
adds
government
could
play
a
bigger
role
in
setting
up
systems
of
trust
for
online
communities
too
proposals
for
id
cards
for
instance
could
also
be
widened
to
see
if
they
could
be
used
online
they
could
provide
the
basis
for
a
secure
authentication
system
which
could
have
value
for
peertopeer
interaction
online
at
the
moment
they
have
been
presented
as
a
way
for
government
to
keep
tabs
on
people
and
ensuring
access
to
public
services
said
mr
davies
but
what
has
not
been
explored
is
how
authentication
technology
may
potentially
play
a
role
in
decentralised
online
communities
the
key
idea
to
take
from
systems
such
as
ebay
and
other
online
communities
is
letting
members
rate
each
others
reputation
by
how
they
treat
other
members
using
a
similar
mechanism
trust
and
cooperation
between
members
of
virtual
and
physical
communities
could
be
built
this
could
mean
a
civic
commons
would
work
within
a
nonmarket
system
which
lets
people
who
may
disagree
with
one
another
interact
within
publiclyrecognised
rules
egovernment
initiatives
over
the
last
decade
have
very
much
been
about
putting
basic
information
and
service
guides
online
as
well
as
letting
people
interact
with
government
via
the
web
many
online
communities
such
as
chatrooms
mailing
lists
community
portals
message
boards
and
weblogs
often
form
around
common
interests
or
issues
with
of
uk
households
now
with
access
to
the
net
the
government
suggests
mr
davies
could
act
as
an
intermediary
or
middleman
to
set
up
public
online
places
of
debate
and
exchange
to
encourage
more
cosmopolitan
politics
and
public
trust
in
policy
government
already
plays
a
critical
role
in
helping
citizens
trade
with
each
other
online
but
it
should
also
play
a
role
in
helping
citizens
connect
to
one
another
in
civic
nonmarket
interactions
said
mr
davies
there
is
a
role
for
public
bodies
like
the
bbc
libraries
and
government
to
bring
people
back
into
public
debate
again
instead
of
millions
of
cliques
talking
to
each
other
he
added
the
paper
is
part
of
the
ipprs
digital
society
initiative
which
is
producing
a
number
of
conferences
and
research
papers
leading
up
to
the
publication
of
a
manifesto
for
a
digital
britain
