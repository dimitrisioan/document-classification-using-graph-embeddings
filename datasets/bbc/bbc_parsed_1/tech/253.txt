books
two
highspeed
lifts
at
the
worlds
tallest
building
have
been
officially
recognised
as
the
planets
fastest
the
lifts
take
only
seconds
to
whisk
passengers
to
the
top
of
the
m
tall
tfc
tower
in
taipei
taiwan
the
guinness
book
of
records
has
declared
the
m
per
second
speed
of
the
two
lifts
the
swiftest
on
earth
the
lifts
also
have
a
pressure
control
system
to
stop
passengers
ears

as
they
ascend
and
descend
at
high
speed
in
total
the
tfc
tower
has
lifts
of
them
doubledeckers
and
escalators
to
shuttle
people
around
its
floors
the
tfc
tower
is
due
to
be
officially
opened
on
december
the
superfast
lifts
can
speed
up
to
passengers
to
the
tip
of
the
tower
in
about
seconds
while
ascending
their
m
track
the
ms
top
speed
of
the
lifts
translates
to
about
mph
kmh
curiously
the
lifts
take
longer
to
descend
and
spend
almost
a
whole
minute
returning
to
ground
level
from
the
top
of
the
tfc
tower
the
key
new
technologies
applied
in
the
worlds
fastest
elevators
include
a
pressure
control
system
which
adjusts
the
atmospheric
pressure
inside
a
car
by
using
suction
and
discharge
blowers
preventing
ear
popping
an
active
control
system
which
tries
to
balance
the
lift
more
finely
and
remove
the
sources
of
vibrations
streamlined
cars
to
reduce
the
whistling
noise
produced
by
running
the
lifts
at
a
high
speed
inside
a
narrow
shaft
the
certification
of
our
elevators
as
world
recordholders
by
the
authoritative
guinness
world
records
is
a
great
honour
for
us

the
first

passenger
elevators
was
published
in
the
first
edition
of
the
guinness

of
records
in
as
such
it
is
an
interesting
indicator
of
how
technology
has
advanced
in
the
years
since
that
first
edition
when
the
record
was
m
per

or
kmh
less
than
half
the

of
the
