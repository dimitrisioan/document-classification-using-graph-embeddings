get
more
information
on
a
favourite
song
they
have
been
listening
to
by
asking

is
this
portable

of
auto
firms
are
working
with
apple
to
device
interfaces

the
firms
ipod
music
player
but
with
tens
of
thousands
of
songs
able
to
be
stored
on
one
player
voice
control
would
make
finding
that

track
by

much
easier
the
firms
gave
no
indication
about
whether
the
ipod
or
any
other
media
player
were
in
mind
for
the
use
of
the
voice
control
technology
the
companies
estimate
that
the
technology
will
be
available
in
the
fourth
