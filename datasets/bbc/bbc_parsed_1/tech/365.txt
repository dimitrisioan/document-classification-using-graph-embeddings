local
net
tv
takes
off
in
austria
an
austrian
village
is
testing
technology
that
could
represent
the
future
of
television
the
people
of
engerwitzdorf
are
filming
editing
and
producing
their
own
regional
news
channel
the
channel
covers
local
politics
sports
events
and
anything
that
residents
want
to
film
and
are
prepared
to
upload
for
others
to
watch
on
pcs
the
pilot
has
been
so
successful
that
telekom
austria
is
now
considering
setting
up
other
projects
elsewhere
its
growing
unbelievably
fast
said
rudolf
fischer
head
of
telekom
austrias
fixed
line
division
the
trial
of
buntes
fernsehen
multicoloured
tv
was
started
in
late
and
creates
a
netbased
tv
station
run
by
the
residents
of
engerwitzdorf
the
hardware
and
software
to
turn
video
footage
into
edited
programmes
has
been
provided
by
telekom
austria
but
this
equipment
following
training
has
been
turned
over
to
the
villagers
any
video
programme
created
by
the
villagers
is
uploaded
to
a
buntes
fernsehen
portal
that
lets
people
browse
and
download
what
they
want
to
watch
most
people
watch
the
tv
on
their
home
pc
and
a
broadband
connection
is
needed
to
get
broadcast
quality
programmes
in
the
first
four
months
of
the
project
villagers
have
created
films
and
put
together
regular
reports
on
local
news
items
they
have
adopted
it
very
quickly
said
mr
fischer
they
like
the
possibility
to
create
their
own
content
and
see
whats
going
on
in
the
area
its
kind
of
the
democratisation
of
local
tv
he
said
because
none
of
the
bigger
broadcasters
would
ever
do
anything
like
this
for
that
region
the
buntes
fernsehen
project
has
been
such
a
success
that
telekom
austria
is
now
considering
setting
up
other
schemes
in
similarly
rural
areas
mr
fischer
said
it
was
taking
the
rollout
to
other
areas
slowly
because
of
the
work
involved
in
setting
up
the
scheme
getting
backers
from
local
government
and
educating
people
how
to
make
programmes
the
engerwitzdorf
scheme
is
an
outgrowth
of
telekom
austrias
online
tv
channel
aon
which
lets
people
watch
programmes
on
their
pc
aon
streams
a
couple
of
live
channels
plus
sports
news
and
music
programmes
on
to
the
net
and
has
a
payfordownload
section
that
lets
people
watch
what
they
want
when
they
want
to
watch
it
in
october
a
larger
tvondemand
project
is
due
to
launch
in
vienna
that
will
let
people
download
many
programmes
from
the
net
