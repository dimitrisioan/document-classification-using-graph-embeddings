about
people
have
been
banned
from
playing
the
halflife
game
game
maker
valve
shut
down
the
online
accounts
of
the
players
because
it
had
evidence
that
their
copy
of
the
game
had
been
obtained
illegally
copies
of
halflife
had
been
circulating
on
filesharing
systems
soon
after
it
was
officially
released
experts
said
the
success
of
the
halflife
antipiracy
system
might
tempt
other
game
makers
into
creating
their
own
version
halflife
was
officially
released
on
november
but
before
gamers
could
get
to
grips
with
the
longawaited
title
they
were
forced
to
authenticate
their
copy
of
the
game
online
authentication
involved
setting
up
an
account
with
valves
gaming
community
system
called
steam
and
letting
that
check
which
copy
of
the
game
was
being
run
in
a
statement
detailing
the
banning
of
the
accounts
valve
said
this
system
helped
identify
who
had
got
hold
of
pirated
copies
the
method
used
was
extremely
easy
for
valve
to
trace
and
confirm
and
so
there
is
no
question
that
the
accounts
disabled
were
used
to
try
and
illegally
obtain
halflife
read
the
statement
valve
spokesman
doug
lombardi
said
that
the
company
had
not
yet
released
sales
figures
for
the
game
and
would
not
say
what
proportion
of
all
steam
players
the
represented
one
effect
of
steams
popularity
has
been
to
limit
the
copies
of
the
game
sold
in
shops
and
artificially
depress
the
games
ranking
in
the
top
ten
even
so
the
title
debuted
at
no
in
the
uk
charts
valve
also
said
that
a
small
number
of
accounts
were
closed
because
people
were
using
stolen
credit
cards
to
buy
copies
of
the
game
or
were
using
stolen
steam
accounts
some
of
those
who
have
been
banned
by
the
move
protested
their
innocence
in
the
online
forums
on
the
main
steam
site
and
said
they
were
being
punished
for
what
other
people
did
with
their
account
some
contributors
to
the
forums
wondered
if
the
action
might
force
more
piracy
as
people
tried
to
get
hold
of
successive
copies
of
the
game
to
keep
ahead
of
valves
antipiracy
actions
in
its
statement
valve
also
said
that
rumours
that
it
distributed
fake
halflife
keys
copies
of
the
game
or
instructions
on
how
to
hack
the
game
just
to
catch
pirates
and
cheats
were
false
the
company
said
the
hack
came
from
the
community
as
do
they
all
it
added
that
most
of
those
banned
simply
tried
to
use
copies
of
halflife
circulating
on
fileswapping
systems
such
as
bit
torrent
rather
than
use
hacks
to
get
around
the
need
for
cd
keys
rob
fahey
editor
of
online
news
site
gamesindustrybiz
said
the
mass
banning
showed
off
the
power
of
the
steam
system
before
now
he
said
it
has
been
hard
for
game
makers
to
do
anything
about
piracy
once
the
game
was
being
played
but
with
this
valve
is
taking
really
effective
steps
against
people
using
illegitimate
copies
of
halflife
he
said
if
steam
proves
effective
at
cutting
the
piracy
of
games
to
a
minimum
said
mr
fahey
other
game
makers
may
be
tempted
to
set
up
copycat
systems
its
not
hard
to
see
a
point
in
the
near
future
when
every
publisher
wants
you
to
run
an
application
on
your
system
purely
to
allow
you
to
play
their
games
he
said
this
could
mean
that
computers
get
cluttered
with
poorly
written
steamtype
systems
that
are
used
to
batter
people
with
adverts
unless
game
firms
were
careful
he
said
they
could
face
a
backlash
from
consumers
who
soon
get
tired
of
maintaining
different
accounts
for
every
game
they
play
