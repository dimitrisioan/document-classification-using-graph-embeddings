pompeii
gets
digital
makeover
the
oldfashioned
audio
tour
of
historical
places
could
soon
be
replaced
with
computergenerated
images
that
bring
the
site
to
life
a
european
unionfunded
project
is
looking
at
providing
tourists
with
computeraugmented
versions
of
archaeological
attractions
it
would
allow
visitors
a
glimpse
of
life
as
it
was
originally
lived
in
places
such
as
pompeii
it
could
pave
the
way
for
a
new
form
of
cultural
tourism
the
technology
would
allow
digital
people
and
other
computergenerated
elements
to
be
combined
with
the
actual
view
seen
by
tourists
as
they
walk
around
an
historical
site
the
lifeplus
project
is
part
of
the
eus
information
society
technologies
initiative
aimed
at
promoting
userfriendly
technology
and
enhancing
european
cultural
heritage
engineers
and
researchers
working
in
the
europewide
consortium
have
come
up
with
a
prototype
augmentedreality
system
it
would
require
the
visitor
to
wear
a
headmounted
display
with
a
miniature
camera
and
a
backpack
computer
the
camera
captures
the
view
and
feeds
it
to
software
on
the
computer
where
the
visitors
viewpoint
is
combined
with
animated
virtual
elements
at
pompeii
for
example
the
visitor
would
not
just
see
the
frescos
taverns
and
villas
that
have
been
excavated
but
also
people
going
about
their
daily
life
augmented
reality
has
been
used
to
create
special
effects
in
films
such
as
troy
and
lord
of
the
rings
and
in
computer
gaming
this
technology
can
now
be
used
for
much
more
than
just
computer
games
said
professor
nadia
magnenatthalman
of
the
swiss
research
group
miralab
we
are
for
the
first
time
able
to
run
this
combination
of
software
processes
to
create
walking
talking
people
with
believable
clothing
skin
and
hair
in
realtime
she
said
unlike
virtual
reality
which
delivers
an
entirely
computergenerated
scene
to
the
viewer
the
lifeplus
project
is
about
combining
digital
and
real
views
crucial
to
the
technique
is
the
software
that
interprets
the
visitors
view
and
provides
an
accurate
match
between
the
real
and
virtual
elements
the
software
capable
of
doing
this
has
been
developed
by
a
uk
company
d
andrew
stoddart
chief
scientist
at
d
said
that
the
eu
project
has
been
driven
by
a
new
desire
to
bring
the
past
to
life
the
popularity
of
television
documentaries
and
dramatisations
using
computergenerated
imagery
to
recreate
scenes
from
ancient
history
demonstrates
the
widespread
appeal
of
bringing
ancient
cultures
to
life
