d
metal
slug
offers
retro
fun
like
some
drill
sergeant
from
the
past
metal
slug
is
a
wakeup
call
to
todays
gamers
mollycoddled
with
slick
visuals
and
fancy
trimmings
with
its
handanimated
sprites
and
d
sidescrolling
this
was
even
considered
retro
when
released
in
arcades
four
years
ago
but
a
more
frantic
shooter
you
will
not
find
at
the
end
of
your
joypad
this
year
and
yes
that
includes
halo
simply
choose
your
grunt
and
wade
through
five
d
sidescrolling
levels
of
the
most
hectic
video
game
blasting
you
will
ever
encounter
it
is
also
the
toughest
game
you
are
likely
to
play
as
hordes
of
enemies
and
few
lives
pile
the
pressure
on
players
must
battle
soldiers
snowmen
zombies
giant
crabs
and
aliens
not
to
mention
the
huge
screenfilling
bosses
that
guard
each
of
the
five
levels
the
shootanythingthatmoves
gameplay
is
peppered
with
moments
of
oldschool
genius
fans
of
robotic
gastropods
should
note
the
title
refers
instead
to
the
vast
array
of
vehicles
on
offer
in
a
game
stuffed
with
bizarre
hardware
tanks
jets
and
submarines
can
be
commandeered
as
well
as
cannontoting
camels
elephants
and
ostriches
more
weaponry
on
offer
than
in
an
acre
of
iraq
doling
out
justice
is
a
joy
thanks
to
ultra
responsive
controls
and
while
this
is
a
tough
nut
to
crack
it
is
addictive
enough
to
have
you
gagging
for
that
one
last
go
and
at
a
mere
â£
metal
slug
is
as
cheap
as
sliced
fried
spuds
as
the
man
says
of
course
most
of
you
will
ignore
this
lacking
as
it
does
the
visual
fireworks
of
modern
blasters
but
at
a
time
when
blockbuster
titles
offer
only
a
fresh
lick
of
paint
in
favour
of
real
innovation
metal
slug
is
a
fresh
gasp
of
air
from
an
era
when
the
xbox
was
not
even
a
twinkle
in
bill
gates
eye
