videoondemand
cable
firms
ntl

telewest
have
both
launched
videoondemand

the
battle

cable
tv
heats
up
movies
from
sony
pictures
walt
disney
touchstone
miramax
columbia
and
buena
vista
will
be
among
those
on
offer
the
service
is
similar
to
sky
plus
as
users
can
pause
fast
forward
and
rewind
content
but
they
can
not
store
programmes
on
their
set
top
box
yet
it
could
sound
the
death
knell
for
some
tv
channels
telewest
predicts
it
allows
us
to
demonstrate
a
clear
competitive
advantage
over
sky
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
said
telewest
chief
executive
eric
tveter
videoondemand
will
offer
a
deeper
range
of
content
than
currently
exists
on
tv
there
will
be
less
compromising
around
the
tv
schedule
and
some
of
the
less
popular
channels
may
go
by
the
wayside
said
philip
snalune
director
of
products
at
telewest
telewest
customers
in
bristol
and
ntl
viewers
in
glasgow
will
be
the
first
to
test
the
new
service
which
sees
a
raft
of
movies
on
offer
for
hour
rental
during
the
year
the
service
will
be
extended
to
all
cable
regions
films
will
range
in
price
from
â£
or
â£
for
archived
movies
to
â£
for
current
releases
new
releases
initially
on
offer
will
include
first
dates
kill
bill
volume
gothika
and
the
station
agent
in
addition
ntl
is
offering
childrens
programmes
adult
content
music
video
and
concerts
telewest
will
launch
similar
services
later
in
the
year
ntl
is
also
offering
viewers
the
chance
to
catch
up
with
programmes
they
have
missed
its
pick
of
the
week
service
will
offer
a
selection
of
bbc
programmes
from
the
previous
seven
days
such
as
eastenders
casualty
top
gear
and
antiques
roadshow
the
bbc
is
trialling
a
similar
service
offering
broadband
users
the
chance
to
watch
programmes
already
broadcast
on
their
pc
for
telewest
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
â£m
investment
in
tvondemand
which
will
also
see
the
launch
of
a
personal
video
recorder
pvr
pvr
has
been
a
big
success
for
sky
because
it
gives
customers
control
over
programmes
satellite
customers
without
pvr
can
not
pause
rewind
or
fast
forward
their
programmes
with
both
services
on
offer
from
telewest
mr
tveter
is
confident
the
cable
firm
can
dent
not
just
the
viewing
figures
for
terrestrial
tv
but
also
gain
a
huge
competitive
advantage
over
sky
we
offer
the
best
of
both
worlds
and
most
households
have
an
interest
in
having
both
videoondemand
and
pvr
he
said
video
rental
stores
may
also
have
to
watch
their
back
videoondemand
is
better
than
having
a
videostore
in
your
living
room
and
is
more
convenient
he
said
ntl
said
it
had
not
ruled
out
the
possibility
of
offering
a
pvr
but
for
the
moment
is
concentrating
on
videoondemand
pvr
is
a
recording
mechanism
whereas
what
we
are
offering
is
truly
on
demand
said
a
spokesman
for
the
company
videoondemand
has
the
added
advantage
of
not
requiring
a
separate
settop
box
or
extra
remote
controls
he
added
adam
thomas
an
analyst
at
research
firm
informa
media
believes
the
time
is
ripe
for
videoondemand
to
flourish
while
sky
will
remain
the
dominant
force
in
uk
pay
tv
for
some
time
to
come
ntl
and
telewest
seem
well
placed
to
successfully
ride
this
second
wave
of
vod
enthusiasm
and
if
marketed
correctly
this
could
help
them
eat
into
skys
lead
he
said
