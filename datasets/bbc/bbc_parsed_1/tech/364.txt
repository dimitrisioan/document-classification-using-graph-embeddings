podcasters
look
to
net
money
nasa
is
doing
it
yearold
boys
in
bedrooms
are
doing
it
couples
are
doing
it
gadget
lovers
male
and
female
are
definitely
doing
it
it
is
podcasting
diy
radio
in
the
form
of
downloadable
mp
audio
files
they
can
done
by
anyone
who
has
a
microphone
simple
software
the
net
and
something
to
say
some
liken
them
to
talking
audioblogs
because
many
complement
textbased
weblogs
diarylike
sites
where
people
share
their
thoughts
they
are
essentially
amateur
radio
shows
on
the
net
on
demand
and
the
movement
is
at
very
early
stages
its
about
real
people
saying
real
things
and
communicating
says
adam
curry
former
mtv
vj
and
the
pied
piper
of
podcasting
he
was
one
of
a
community
of
people
who
created
ipodder
a
small
computer
program
known
as
an
aggregator
it
collects
and
automatically
sends
mp
files
to
any
digital
musicplaying
device
that
can
play
wmp
formats
those
with
digital
music
players
can
select
which
podcasts
they
like
and
subscribe
for
free
to
that
shows
feed
when
a
new
podcast
is
available
it
is
automatically
sent
to
the
device
when
connected
to
a
computer
it
is
totally
going
to
kill
the
business
model
of
radio
thinks
curry
i
just
did
a
tour
of
madison
avenue
where
all
the
big
brands
and
advertising
agencies
of
the
world
are
he
says
and
they
are
scared
to
death
of
the
next
generation
like
my
daughter
who
is
who
dont
listen
to
radio
they
are
on
msn
theyve
got
their
ipod
their
mp
player
theyve
got
their
xbox
they
are
not
listening
to
radio
so
how
are
they
going
to
reach
these
audiences
it
is
the
distribution
that
is
changing
and
the
barriers
are
being
brought
down
so
everyone
can
be
part
of
it
it
is
a
fledgling
movement
but
it
is
gaining
momentum
now
that
people
have
started
thinking
about
how
to
make
a
business
from
it
ian
fogg
jupiter
research
analyst
thinks
there
could
be
potential
for
business
but
it
could
take
an
interesting
turn
if
big
companies
like
apple
and
microsoft
get
involved
it
is
a
nascent
area
but
quite
exciting
it
is
yet
another
area
that
demonstrates
the
move
to
a
digital
lifestyle
and
digital
home
is
not
over
he
says
podcasting
is
one
of
those
interesting
areas
that
bridges
what
you
do
at
home
and
what
you
do
out
and
about
a
classic
hybrid
it
is
another
aspect
of
the
timeshifting
of
content
the
latest
industry
buzzword
for
being
able
to
listen
to
what
you
want
when
and
wherever
you
want
audiences
are
in
the
s
s
and
s
rather
than
millions
more
than
podcasts
are
currently
listed
currys
daily
source
code
which
he
committed
to
doing
daily
to
inspire
the
community
has
s
of
thousands
of
listeners
but
dave
winer
is
doubtful
he
designed
the
format
called
rss
really
simple
syndication
which
gives
web
users
an
easy
way
to
keep
updated
automatically
on
sites
they
like
podcasts
rely
on
his
technology
because
it
is
the
way
they
are
distributed
he
is
also
writer
of
the
longestrunning
weblog
on
the
net
scripting
news
he
thinks
its
power
lies
in
its
democratising
potential
not
in
its
overhyped
business
promise
were
the
sources
the
people
doing
stuff
and
podcasting
is
a
way
to
tell
people
who
care
what
were
doing
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
commercialising
this
medium
isnt
going
to
make
very
much
money
he
says
podcasting
is
going
to
be
a
medium
of
niches
with
audiences
measured
in
the
single
digits
like
email
or
blogs
maybe
in
a
few
years
maybe
six
or
seven
digits
but
it
will
have
to
sustain
interest
beyond
the
hype
balloon
curry
and
associate
ron
blooms
new
venture
called
podshow
is
to
help
ordinary
people
produce
post
distribute
and
market
their
podcasts
because
of
the
way
podcasts
work
based
on
rss
the
latest
podcasts
which
people
can
select
mean
that
they
are
readymade
targets
when
you
look
at
podcasting
wow
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
audience
the
audience
is
preselected
they
have
decided
to
subscribe
to
your
program
explains
curry
advertising
in
his
eyes
can
be
tailored
to
podcasts
to
make
it
more
imaginative
and
unobtrusive
how
i
believe
this
will
work
is
to
create
a
network
that
in
aggregation
will
have
enough
numbers
to
support
a
return
on
investment
for
the
advertisers
and
for
the
podcasters
i
have
listeners
i
could
make
a
couple
of
bucks
off
that
but
not
much
if
you
are
talking
a
million
podcasters
and
then
you
can
kind
of
divide
that
amongst
ourselves
then
that
is
kind
of
interesting
essentially
he
says
if
you
are
doing
a
bass
fishing
podcast
someone
who
is
selling
bait
and
tackle
will
probably
want
to
advertise
on
your
show
he
is
clear
the
ads
will
not
be
the
traditional
inyourface
type
familiar
to
commercial
radio
now
we
are
really
going
to
see
these
microcosms
and
commerce
will
be
all
over
the
place
it
is
happening
already
coffeeloving
curry
has
sold
worth
of
coffee
machines
through
a
referral
link
to
amazon
from
his
site
others
use
inshow
promotions
like
the
dawn
and
drew
show
one
eric
rice
has
won
sponsorship
from
warner
bros
he
can
now
legally
play
the
music
of
a
band
warner
bros
wants
to
push
some
commentators
on
the
net
say
it
has
a
similar
feel
to
the
dotcom
days
others
say
it
is
just
another
element
of
setting
media
free
from
big
companies
and
letting
people
be
creative
one
thing
is
for
sure
they
are
not
about
to
disappear
in
a
hurry
the
creative
forces
behind
radio
are
elated
says
curry
for
now
he
tunes
out
the
negative
comments
within
the
podcasting
community
i
should
be
knighted
for
this
he
adds
with
a
wry
chuckle
people
are
going
to
be
so
happy
to
sit
at
home
make
their
podcast
and
make
a
little
money
