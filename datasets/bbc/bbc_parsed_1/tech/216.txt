tv
future
in
the
hands
of
viewers
with
home
theatre
systems
plasma
highdefinition
tvs
and
digital
video
recorders
moving
into
the
living
room
the
way
people
watch
tv
will
be
radically
different
in
five
years
time
that
is
according
to
an
expert
panel
which
gathered
at
the
annual
consumer
electronics
show
in
las
vegas
to
discuss
how
these
new
technologies
will
impact
one
of
our
favourite
pastimes
with
the
us
leading
the
trend
programmes
and
other
content
will
be
delivered
to
viewers
via
home
networks
through
cable
satellite
telecoms
companies
and
broadband
service
providers
to
front
rooms
and
portable
devices
one
of
the
most
talkedabout
technologies
of
ces
has
been
digital
and
personal
video
recorders
dvr
and
pvr
these
settop
boxes
like
the
uss
tivo
and
the
uks
sky
system
allow
people
to
record
store
play
pause
and
forward
wind
tv
programmes
when
they
want
essentially
the
technology
allows
for
much
more
personalised
tv
they
are
also
being
builtin
to
highdefinition
tv
sets
which
are
big
business
in
japan
and
the
us
but
slower
to
take
off
in
europe
because
of
the
lack
of
highdefinition
programming
not
only
can
people
forward
wind
through
adverts
they
can
also
forget
about
abiding
by
network
and
channel
schedules
putting
together
their
own
alacarte
entertainment
but
some
us
networks
and
cable
and
satellite
companies
are
worried
about
what
it
means
for
them
in
terms
of
advertising
revenues
as
well
as
brand
identity
and
viewer
loyalty
to
channels
although
the
us
leads
in
this
technology
at
the
moment
it
is
also
a
concern
that
is
being
raised
in
europe
particularly
with
the
growing
uptake
of
services
like
sky
what
happens
here
today
we
will
see
in
nine
months
to
a
years
time
in
the
uk
adam
hume
the
bbc
broadcasts
futurologist
told
the
bbc
news
website
for
the
likes
of
the
bbc
there
are
no
issues
of
lost
advertising
revenue
yet
it
is
a
more
pressing
issue
at
the
moment
for
commercial
uk
broadcasters
but
brand
loyalty
is
important
for
everyone
we
will
be
talking
more
about
content
brands
rather
than
network
brands
said
tim
hanlon
from
brand
communications
firm
starcom
mediavest
the
reality
is
that
with
broadband
connections
anybody
can
be
the
producer
of
content
he
added
the
challenge
now
is
that
it
is
hard
to
promote
a
programme
with
so
much
choice
what
this
means
said
stacey
jolna
senior
vice
president
of
tv
guide
tv
group
is
that
the
way
people
find
the
content
they
want
to
watch
has
to
be
simplified
for
tv
viewers
it
means
that
networks
in
us
terms
or
channels
could
take
a
leaf
out
of
googles
book
and
be
the
search
engine
of
the
future
instead
of
the
scheduler
to
help
people
find
what
they
want
to
watch
this
kind
of
channel
model
might
work
for
the
younger
ipod
generation
which
is
used
to
taking
control
of
their
gadgets
and
what
they
play
on
them
but
it
might
not
suit
everyone
the
panel
recognised
older
generations
are
more
comfortable
with
familiar
schedules
and
channel
brands
because
they
know
what
they
are
getting
they
perhaps
do
not
want
so
much
of
the
choice
put
into
their
hands
mr
hanlon
suggested
on
the
other
end
you
have
the
kids
just
out
of
diapers
who
are
pushing
buttons
already
everything
is
possible
and
available
to
them
said
mr
hanlon
ultimately
the
consumer
will
tell
the
market
they
want
of
the
new
gadgets
and
technologies
being
showcased
at
ces
many
of
them
are
about
enhancing
the
tvwatching
experience
highdefinition
tv
sets
are
everywhere
and
many
new
models
of
lcd
liquid
crystal
display
tvs
have
been
launched
with
dvr
capability
built
into
them
instead
of
being
external
boxes
one
such
example
launched
at
the
show
is
humaxs
inch
lcd
tv
with
an
hour
tivo
dvr
and
dvd
recorder
one
of
the
uss
biggest
satellite
tv
companies
directtv
has
even
launched
its
own
branded
dvr
at
the
show
with
hours
of
recording
capability
instant
replay
and
a
search
function
the
set
can
pause
and
rewind
tv
for
up
to
hours
and
microsoft
chief
bill
gates
announced
in
his
preshow
keynote
speech
a
partnership
with
tivo
called
tivotogo
which
means
people
can
play
recorded
programmes
on
windows
pcs
and
mobile
devices
all
these
reflect
the
increasing
trend
of
freeing
up
multimedia
so
that
people
can
watch
what
they
want
when
they
want
