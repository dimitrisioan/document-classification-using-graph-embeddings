peertopeer
pp
networks
are
here
to
stay
and
are
on
the
verge
of
being
exploited
by
commercial
media
firms
says
a
panel
of
industry
experts
once
several
highprofile
legal
cases
against
filesharers
are
resolved
this
year
firms
will
be
very
keen
to
try
and
make
money
from
pp
technology
the
expert
panel
probed
the
future
of
pp
at
the
consumer
electronics
show
in
las
vegas
earlier
in
january
the
first
convictions
for
pp
piracy
were
handed
out
in
the
us
in
january
william
trowbridge
and
michael
chicoine
pleaded
guilty
to
charges
that
they
infringed
copyright
by
illegally
sharing
music
movies
and
software
since
the
first
successful
filesharing
network
napster
was
forced
to
close
down
the
entertainment
industry
has
been
nervous
and
critical
of
pp
technology
blaming
it
for
falling
sales
and
piracy
but
that
is
going
to
change
very
soon
according
to
the
panel
the
music
and
film
industries
have
started
some
big
legal
cases
against
owners
of
legitimate
pp
networks
which
are
not
illegal
in
themselves
and
of
individuals
accused
of
distributing
pirated
content
over
networks
but
they
have
slowly
realised
that
pp
is
a
good
way
to
distribute
content
said
travis
kalanick
founder
and
chairman
of
pp
network
red
swoosh
and
soon
they
are
all
going
to
want
a
slice
of
it
they
are
just
waiting
to
come
up
with
business
models
that
work
for
them
which
includes
digital
rights
management
and
copyprotection
standards
but
until
the
legal
actions
are
resolved
experimentation
with
pp
can
not
not
happen
said
michael
weiss
president
of
streamcast
networks
remembering
the
furore
around
vcrs
when
they
first
came
out
mr
weiss
said
old
media
always
tries
to
stop
new
media
when
they
cant
stop
it
they
try
to
control
it
then
they
figure
out
how
to
make
money
and
they
always
make
a
lot
of
money
once
the
courts
decided
that
the
vcr
in
itself
was
not
an
illegal
technology
the
film
studios
turned
it
into
an
extremely
lucrative
business
in
august
the
san
franciscobased
us
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
favour
of
grokster
and
streamcast
two
filesharing
networks
the
court
said
they
were
essentially
in
the
same
position
that
sony
was
in
the
s
vcr
battle
and
said
that
the
networks
themselves
could
not
be
deemed
as
illegal
pp
networks
usually
do
not
rely
on
dedicated
servers
for
the
transfer
of
files
instead
it
uses
direct
connections
between
computers
or
clients
there
are
now
many
different
types
of
pp
systems
than
work
in
different
ways
pp
nets
can
be
used
to
share
any
kind
of
file
like
photos
free
software
licensed
music
and
any
other
digital
content
the
bbc
has
already
decided
to
embrace
the
technology
it
aims
to
offer
most
of
its
own
programmes
for
download
this
year
and
it
will
use
pp
technology
to
distribute
them
the
files
would
be
locked
seven
days
after
a
programme
aired
making
rights
management
easier
to
control
but
the
technology
is
still
demonised
and
misunderstood
by
many
the
global
entertainment
industry
says
more
than
billion
copyrighted
music
files
are
downloaded
every
month
and
about
half
a
million
films
are
downloaded
a
day
legal
music
download
services
like
apple
itunes
napster
have
rushed
into
the
music
marketplace
to
try
and
lure
filesharers
away
from
free
content
sales
of
legallydownloaded
songs
grew
tenfold
in
with
million
tracks
bought
online
in
the
us
and
europe
in
months
the
ifpi
reported
this
week
but
such
download
services
are
very
different
from
pp
networks
not
least
because
of
the
financial
aspect
there
are
several
moneyspinning
models
that
could
turn
pp
into
a
golden
egg
for
commercial
entertainment
companies
paidforpassalong
in
which
firms
receive
money
each
time
a
file
is
shared
along
with
various
drm
solutions
and
advertiserbased
options
are
all
being
considered
we
see
there
are
going
to
be
different
models
for
commoditising
pp
said
marc
morgenstern
vice
president
of
antipiracy
firm
overpeer
consumers
are
hungry
for
it
and
we
will
discover
new
models
together
agreed
mr
morgenstern
but
many
net
users
will
continue
to
ignore
the
entertainment
industrys
potential
controlling
grip
on
content
and
pp
technology
by
continuing
to
use
it
for
their
own
creations
unsigned
bands
for
example
use
pp
networks
to
distribute
their
music
effectively
which
also
draws
the
attention
of
record
companies
looking
for
new
artists
to
sign
increasingly
what
you
are
seeing
on
pp
is
consumercreated
content
said
derek
broes
from
microsoft
they
will
probably
pay
an
increasing
role
in
helping
pp
spread
he
said
looking
into
pps
future
file
sharing
is
just
the
beginning
for
pp
networks
as
far
as
mr
broes
is
concerned
once
some
of
these
issues
are
resolved
you
are
going
to
see
aggressive
movement
to
protect
content
but
also
in
ways
that
are
unimaginable
now
he
said
filesharing
is
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
