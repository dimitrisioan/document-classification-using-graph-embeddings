what
highdefinition
will
do
to
dvds
first
it
was
the
humble
home
video
then
it
was
the
dvd
and
now
hollywood
is
preparing
for
the
next
revolution
in
home
entertainment
highdefinition
highdefinition
gives
incredible
dlike
pictures
and
surround
sound
the
dvd
disks
and
the
gear
to
play
them
will
not
be
out
for
another
year
or
so
and
there
at
are
still
a
number
of
issues
to
be
sorted
out
but
when
highdefinition
films
do
come
out
on
the
new
format
dvds
it
will
profoundly
change
home
entertainment
for
rick
dean
director
of
business
development
for
digital
content
company
thx
a
highdefinition
future
is
an
exciting
prospect
he
has
worked
on
the
star
wars
dvd
trilogy
finding
nemo
the
incredibles
and
indiana
jones
there
was
a
time
not
so
long
ago
when
the
film
world
and
the
video
world
were
two
completely
separate
worlds
he
told
the
bbc
news
website
the
technology
we
are
dealing
with
now
means
they
are
very
much
conjoined
the
film
that
we
see
in
theatres
is
coming
from
the
same
digital
file
that
we
take
the
home
video
master
he
says
but
currently
putting
a
master
feature
film
onto
dvd
requires
severe
compression
because
current
dvd
technology
can
not
hold
as
much
as
highdefinition
films
demand
as
much
as
you
compress
the
picture
data
rate
wise
you
also
take
qualities
away
from
the
picture
that
we
fight
so
hard
to
keep
in
the
master
he
explains
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
show
people
what
projects
that
we
worked
on
really
look
like
in
the
highdef
world
and
i
find
it
very
exciting
highdefinition
dvds
can
hold
up
to
six
times
more
data
than
the
dvds
we
are
used
to
it
will
take
time
though
to
persuade
people
who
spent
money
on
dvd
players
to
buy
the
different
players
and
displays
required
to
watch
highdefinition
dvds
in
months
time
mr
dean
is
confident
though
i
think
if
they
see
real
hd
highdefinition
not
some
heavily
compressed
version
of
it
there
is
such
a
remarkable
difference
i
have
heard
comments
from
people
who
say
the
images
pop
off
the
screen
highdefinition
will
mean
some
changes
for
those
working
behind
the
scenes
too
on
the
whole
producing
films
for
highdefinition
dvds
will
be
easier
in
some
ways
because
less
compression
is
needed
equally
it
may
mean
hollywood
studios
ask
for
more
to
be
put
onto
the
average
dvd
when
we
master
movies
right
now
our
data
rates
are
running
at
about
gigabits
per
second
says
mr
dean
our
dvds
that
we
put
out
today
have
to
be
squashed
down
to
about
five
or
six
megabits
per
second
thats
a
huge
amount
of
compression
that
has
to
be
applied
about
so
if
you
have
anything
that
allows
more
space
you
dont
have
to
compress
so
hard
studios
could
fit
a
lot
more
marketing
material
games
and
features
onto
highcapacity
dvds
currently
an
entire
dvd
project
can
take
up
to
three
months
says
mr
dean
although
the
step
of
downconverting
will
be
bypassed
this
will
realistically
only
save
a
days
work
says
mr
dean
one
of
the
most
time
consuming
elements
is
building
dvd
navigation
and
menu
systems
on
the
fairly
complex
star
wars
disks
making
sure
the
menu
buttons
worked
took
human
hours
alone
if
studios
want
to
cash
in
on
the
extra
space
it
could
mean
extra
human
hours
for
which
someone
has
to
pay
if
the
decision
on
the
studio
side
is
that
they
are
going
to
put
a
lot
more
on
these
disks
it
could
be
more
expensive
because
of
all
the
extra
navigation
that
is
required
and
if
studios
do
focus
on
delivering
more
added
value
content
thinks
mr
dean
ultimately
it
could
mean
that
they
will
want
more
money
for
it
those
costs
could
filter
down
to
the
price
ticket
on
a
highdefinition
dvd
but
if
the
consumer
is
not
willing
to
pay
a
premium
price
studios
will
listen
thinks
mr
dean
highdefinition
throws
up
other
challenge
to
film
makers
and
dvd
production
alike
more
clarity
on
screen
means
film
makers
have
to
make
doubly
sure
that
attention
to
detail
is
meticulous
when
we
did
the
first
hd
version
of
star
wars
episode
i
everybody
was
very
suntanned
but
that
was
makeup
in
the
hd
version
of
episode
i
all
these
makeup
lines
showed
up
explains
mr
dean
the
restoration
of
the
older
star
wars
episodes
revealed
some
interesting
items
too
there
are
scans
of
a
corridor
on
the
death
star
and
fairly
plainly
in
one
of
those
shots
there
is
a
file
cabinet
stuck
behind
one
of
the
doorways
you
never
used
to
be
able
to
see
it
because
things
are
just
blurred
enough
during
the
pan
that
you
just
didnt
see
it
what
highdefinition
revolution
ultimately
means
is
that
the
line
between
home
entertainment
and
cinema
worlds
will
blur
with
home
theatre
systems
turning
living
rooms
into
cinemas
this
line
blurs
even
further
it
could
also
mean
that
how
we
get
films
and
in
what
format
will
widen
in
the
future
we
are
going
to
look
towards
file
delivery
over
ip
internet
protocol
broadband
giving
a
dvdlike
experience
from
the
settop
box
to
the
hard
drive
says
mr
dean
but
that
is
some
time
off
for
most
and
for
now
people
still
like
to
show
off
something
physical
in
their
bookshelves
