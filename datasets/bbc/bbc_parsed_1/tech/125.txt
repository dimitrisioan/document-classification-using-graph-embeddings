the
force
is
strong
in
battlefront
the
warm
reception
that
has
greeted
star
wars
battlefront
is
a
reflection
not
of
any
ingenious
innovation
in
its
gameplay
but
of
its
backtobasics
approach
and
immense
nostalgia
quotient
geared
towards
online
gamers
it
is
based
around
little
more
than
a
series
of
allout
gunfights
set
in
an
array
of
locations
all
featured
in
or
hinted
at
during
the
two
blockbusting
film
trilogies
previous
star
wars
titles
like
the
acclaimed
knights
of
the
old
republic
and
jedi
knight
have
regularly
impressed
with
their
imaginative
forays
into
the
far
corners
of
the
franchises
extensive
universe
and
their
use
of
weird
and
wonderful
new
characters
battlefront
on
the
other
hand
wholeheartedly
revisits
the
most
recognisable
elements
of
the
hit
movies
themselves
the
sights
sounds
and
protagonists
on
show
here
will
all
be
instantly
familiar
to
fans
who
may
well
feel
that
the
opportunity
to
relive
star
wars
most
memorable
screen
skirmishes
makes
this
the
game
they
have
always
waited
for
the
mayhem
can
be
viewed
from
either
a
third
or
firstperson
perspective
and
you
can
either
fight
for
the
forces
of
freedom
or
join
darth
vader
on
the
dark
side
depending
on
the
episode
and
type
of
campaign
as
well
as
the
players
personal
propensity
for
good
or
evil
there
is
ample
chance
to
be
a
wookie
shoot
ewoks
and
rush
into
battle
alongside
a
firedup
luke
skywalker
in
each
section
the
task
is
simply
to
wipe
out
enemy
troops
seize
strategic
waypoints
and
move
on
to
the
next
planet
it
really
is
no
more
complicated
than
that
locations
include
the
frozen
wastes
of
hoth
the
ice
planet
from
the
empire
strikes
back
complete
with
massive
mechanical
atats
on
the
march
there
are
also
the
dusty
sinister
deserts
of
tatooine
and
geonosis
as
well
as
the
forest
moon
of
endor
where
return
of
the
jedis
muchmaligned
ewoks
lived
the
feel
of
those
places
is
well
and
truly
captured
with
both
backdrops
and
characters
looking
good
and
very
authentic
it
is
worth
noting
though
that
on
the
playstation
the
games
graphics
are
a
curiously
long
way
behind
those
of
the
xbox
version
the
pivotal
element
behind
battlefronts
success
is
that
it
successfully
gives
you
the
feel
of
being
of
being
plunged
into
the
midst
of
largescale
war
the
number
of
combatants
noise
and
abundance
of
laser
fire
see
to
that
and
the
sense
of
chaos
really
comes
over
speaking
of
noise
battlefront
is
a
real
testament
to
the
strength
of
the
star
wars
galaxys
audio
motifs
the
multitude
of
distinctive
weapon
and
vehicle
noises
are
immensely
familiar
as
are
the
stirring
john
williams
symphonies
that
never
let
up
there
is
also
a
particularly
snazzy
remix
of
one
of
his
themes
in
the
menu
section
it
has
to
be
said
if
the
game
did
not
have
the
boon
of
being
star
wars
it
would
not
stand
up
for
long
the
gameplay
is
reliable
bogstandard
stuff
short
on
originality
there
are
also
odd
annoyances
like
the
games
insistence
on
respawning
you
miles
away
from
the
action
an
irritating
price
to
pay
for
not
getting
blown
up
the
second
you
appear
and
some
of
the
weapons
and
vehicles
are
not
as
responsive
and
fluid
to
operate
as
they
might
be
that
said
it
is
still
great
fun
to
pilot
a
scout
walker
or
speeder
bike
however
non
userfriendly
they
prove
whilst
it
is
firmly
designed
with
multiplayer
action
in
mind
battlefront
is
actually
perfectly
good
fun
as
an
offline
game
the
aboveaverage
ai
of
the
enemy
sees
to
that
although
given
the
frenetic
environments
they
operate
in
their
strategic
behaviour
does
not
need
to
be
all
that
sophisticated
battlefronts
novelty
value
will
doubtless
wear
off
relatively
fast
leaving
behind
a
slightly
empty
onetrickpony
of
a
game
but
for
a
while
it
is
an
absolute
blast
and
one
of
the
most
immediately
satisfying
video
game
offerings
yet
