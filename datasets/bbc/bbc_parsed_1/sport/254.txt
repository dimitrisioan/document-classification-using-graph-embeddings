for
anything
that
might
have
been
mistakenly
taken
from
the
french
press
we
are
a
big
club
nicolas
told
me
that
he
agrees
with
me
that
we
are
a
big
club
wardle
was
speaking
at
the
clubs
annual
general
meeting
where
he
also
confirmed
the
club
had
not
received
any
bids
for
the
former

the
club
still
owe
french
club
psg
â£m
from
the
purchase
of
anelka
in
may
he
has
been
linked
with
a
move
to
barcelona
and
liverpool
and
reds

revealed
he
is
an
admirer

but
wardle
added
theres
been
no
bids
for
nicolas
anelka
noone
has
come
to
me
and
said
i
would
like
to
buy
nicolas
anelka
if
a
bid
comes
in
for
nicolas
anelka
i
will
speak
to
the
board
and
then
speak
to
kevin
keegan
if
there
was
a
bid
and
it
was
a
bid
of
substance
and
worth
taking
then
between
us
wed
decide
we
still
owe
some
money
on
nicolas
which
we
have
clear
out
so
it
would
have
to
be
above
that
wardle
did
stress
that
the
club
was
not
inviting
any
offers
for
england
winger
shaun
wrightphillips
he
added
ive
no
intention
of
selling
shaun
wrightphillips
if
someone
comes
with
a
silly
bid
ill
have
to
discuss
it
but
were
not
putting
him
on
the
shelf
to
sell
he
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
this
club
and
has
his
heart
and
sole
in
this
club
and
he
would
be
very
upset
if
i
put
him
in
the
shop
window
he
was
an
academy
kid
here
hes
just
signed
a
new
fouryear
deal
i
dont
think
hed
do
that
unless
he
wanted
to
play
for
manchester
city
football
club
city
recently
announced
debts
of
â£m
but
wardle
confirmed
they
would
try
and
find
funds
to
bring
in
players
in
the
january
transfer
window
he
said
like
kevin
id
like
to
see
some
players
come
in
weve
got
to
see
what
we
can
do
whether
its
a
on
a
bosman
or
not
we
will
try
to
be
creative
to
generate
some
funds
but
maybe
we
have
to
start
looking
at
clubs
like
everton
and
bolton
to
see
how
they
have
been
dealing
in
the
transfer
market
and
do
a
similar
type
of
thing
