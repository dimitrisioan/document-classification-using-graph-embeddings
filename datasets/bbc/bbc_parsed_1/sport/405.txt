ireland
consigned
england
to
their
third
straight
six
nations
defeat
with
a
stirring
victory
at
lansdowne
road
a
secondhalf
try
from
captain
brian
odriscoll
and
points
from
ronan
ogara
kept
ireland
on
track
for
their
first
grand
slam
since
england
scored
first
through
martin
corry
but
had
tries
from
mark
cueto
and
josh
lewsey
disallowed
andy
robinsons
men
have
now
lost
nine
of
their
last
matches
since
the
world
cup
final
the
defeat
also
heralded
englands
worst
run
in
the
championship
since
ireland
last
won
the
title
then
the
five
nations
in
but
years
on
they
share
top
spot
in
the
table
on
maximum
points
with
wales
and
eddie
osullivans
side
banished
the
ghosts
of
when
england
were
rampant
victors
in
claiming
the
grand
slam
at
lansdowne
road
in
front
of
a
supercharged
home
crowd
on
a
dry
but
blustery
day
in
dublin
ireland
tore
into
the
whiteshirted
visitors
from
the
kickoff
and
made
their
intentions
clear
when
ogara
landed
a
fourthminute
dropgoal
england
took
their
time
to
settle
but
their
first
real
venture
into
irelands
half
produced
a
simple
score
for
corry
the
number
eight
picked
up
the
ball
from
the
back
of
a
ruck
and
found
an
absence
of
green
jerseys
between
himself
and
the
irish
line
racing
yards
to
touch
down
england
flyhalf
charlie
hodgson
nailed
the
conversion
from
out
on
the
left
but
almost
immediately
ogara
winning
his
th
cap
answered
with
two
penalties
in
quick
succession
england
were
awarded
a
penalty
of
their
own
on
the
halfway
line
after
minutes
and
hodgson
the
villain
at
twickenham
coolly
bisected
the
posts
the
first
quarter
was
marked
by
periods
of
tactical
kicking
but
it
was
ireland
who
were
showing
more
willingness
to
spread
the
ball
wide
to
their
eager
and
inventive
backs
a
series
of
probes
led
by
the
talismanic
odriscoll
back
from
hamstring
injury
resulted
in
a
penalty
but
ireland
chose
to
kick
for
touch
from
the
lineout
the
ball
was
recycled
back
to
ogara
who
stroked
his
second
dropgoal
this
time
off
the
right
upright
as
the
interval
approached
wing
josh
lewsey
was
the
catalyst
for
englands
most
promising
attack
the
wasps
star
raced
up
his
touchline
and
hodgsons
crosskick
put
in
mark
cueto
for
an
apparent
score
but
the
sale
wing
was
ruled
to
have
started
in
front
of
the
kicker
england
began
the
second
half
well
and
had
ireland
pinned
in
their
own
half
but
another
english
indiscretion
on
a
rare
irish
breakout
awarded
ogara
a
kick
at
goal
which
he
missed
englands
pressure
continued
and
a
wave
of
attacks
saw
centre
jamie
noon
dragged
down
yards
from
the
line
before
hodgson
landed
a
dropgoal
the
lead
was
shortlived
however
ireland
raced
upfield
deft
handling
from
the
backs
including
a
clever
dummy
from
geordan
murphy
on
hodgson
ending
with
odriscoll
going
over
in
the
right
corner
and
touching
down
close
to
the
posts
ogara
missed
a
penalty
which
would
have
put
ireland
nine
points
clear
and
the
home
crowd
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
hodgsons
crosskick
was
fumbled
by
lock
ben
kay
near
the
line
anticipation
of
a
home
win
sent
the
noise
level
skyhigh
but
ogara
missed
another
chance
to
seal
the
game
with
a
wayward
dropgoal
attempt
inside
the
last
minutes
england
poured
forward
spurred
on
by
scrumhalf
matt
dawson
who
replaced
leicesters
harry
ellis
but
despite
one
near
miss
with
the
pack
over
the
line
not
checked
on
the
tv
replay
by
referee
jonathan
kaplan
england
were
unable
to
pull
off
a
facesaving
win
ireland

face

at

in

weeks
time
