parry
puts
gerrard
above
money
listen
to
the
full
interview
on
sport
on
five
and
the
bbc
sport
website
from
gmt
but
parry
speaking
exclusively
to
bbc
sport
also
admits
gerrard
who
has
been
constantly
linked
with
chelsea
will
have
the
final
say
on
his
future
he
told
bbc
five
live
steven
is
above
money
he
is
the
future
of
liverpool
it
doesnt
matter
if
its
â£m
â£m
or
â£m
we
will
not
accept
offers
but
we
are
also
realistic
enough
to
know
we
cant
keep
steven
against
his
will
on
the
subject
of
liverpools
finances
parry
also
revealed
the
club
is
ready
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
sponsorship
deal
for
its
proposed
new
stadium
and
responding
to
criticism
from
bbc
sport
pundit
and
former
liverpool
stalwart
alan
hansen
he
insisted
talks
on
new
investment
are
ongoing
but
added
the
door
has
not
closed
on
shareholder
and
lifelong
fan
steve
morgan
parry
joined
liverpool
as
chief
executive
in
july
from
a
similar
role
at
the
premier
league
there
have
been
several
highs
and
lows
during
his
time
in
charge
at
anfield
and
he
had
a
busy
summer
overseeing
the
arrival
of
new
manager
rafael
benitez
and
managing
to
hold
on
to
steven
gerrard
on
the
subject
of
liverpools
captain
and
prize
asset
parry
revealed
real
madrid
did
ask
for
an
option
on
the
england
midfield
man
during
negotiations
for
striker
fernando
morientes
he
said
they
were
looking
for
ways
of
saying
they
got
more
out
of
the
deal
for
fernando
morientes
but
the
response
to
real
madrid
was
the
same
steven
is
not
for
sale
but
when
asked
if
gerrard
would
be
a
liverpool
player
on
the
first
day
of
next
season
parry
said
i
sincerely
hope
he
will
be
steven
knows
my
views
he
knows
rafas
views
we
have
reaffirmed
recently
to
steven
that
we
are
trying
to
build
a
team
around
him
we
crave
success
as
much
as
he
does
we
know
hes
ambitious
and
nobody
can
argue
with
that
i
think
steven
would
dearly
love
to
win
things
with
liverpool
more
than
hed
like
to
do
anything
else
we
all
want
to
see
progress
by
next
season
hes
not
alone
in
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
players
who
feel
the
same
so
we
all
have
a
common
aim
it
is
expected
chelsea
will
test
liverpool
with
a
â£mplus
bid
in
the
summer
but
parry
claims
he
will
be
in
no
mood
to
listen
there
have
been
a
lot
of
open
secrets
about
steven
most
of
which
have
been
complete
myths
it
is
suggested
we
had
a
deal
tied
up
last
summer
we
didnt
had
an
offer
last
summer
parry
explained
we
had
told
chelsea
that
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
he
was
not
for
sale
and
we
didnt
want
to
sell
him
in
reality
it
didnt
go
beyond
that
maybe
there
will
be
an
offer
in
the
summer
maybe
there
wont
our
position
is
we
want
steven
to
stay
but
we
are
also
realistic
enough
and
have
enough
respect
for
steven
and
he
has
enough
respect
for
us
to
know
that
it
is
his
decision
that
will
be
crucial
you
are
not
going
to
keep
a
player
like
steven
against
his
will
that
just
doesnt
work
but
any
idea
we
are
going
to
accept
offers
for
steven
and
then
tell
him
by
the
way
weve
decided
to
sell
you
is
not
on
the
agenda
you
can
forget
that
parry
is
currently
in
the
process
of
finalising
funding
for
liverpools
new
stadium
in
stanley
park
which
is
set
to
open
in
and
he
confessed
arsenals
â£m
deal
with
emirates
to
sponsor
their
new
ground
complete
with
naming
rights
has
given
the
anfield
club
serious
food
for
thought
he
said
i
have
to
say
historically
it
is
something
i
have
been
against
and
i
have
been
on
record
as
saying
that
but
i
think
the
size
of
the
arsenal
deal
is
a
real
eyeopener
i
would
say
in
the
past
deals
have
been
done
frankly
far
too
cheaply
and
it
just
hasnt
even
been
worth
contemplating
but
the
arsenal
deal
is
the
sort
of
deal
that
causes
you
to
draw
breath
and
say
wow
thats
interesting
my
personal
point
of
view
is
that
i
would
find
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
palatable
than
a
shared
stadium
some
liverpool
fans
would
find
such
a
move
highly
controversial
but
parry
countered
i
recognise
it
would
be
an
emotive
issue
for
many
supporters
but
you
look
at
the
amount
of
money
available
and
it
could
go
into
the
team
if
it
was
the
right
partner
how
strong
an
issue
is
it
time
will
tell
i
think
the
stadium
will
always
be
anfield
not
least
because
of
where
it
is
but
do
we
need
to
investigate
the
possibilities
of
sponsorship
i
think
it
would
be
remiss
not
to
thats
not
to
say
we
have
made
a
decision
that
we
will
go
down
that
road
but
i
think
it
is
clearly
something
we
have
to
explore
on
the
subject
of
possible
new
investment
parry
revealed
liverpool
are
still
in
negotiations
with
a
mystery
investor
with
rumours
of
interest
from
the
middle
east
that
prompted
the
withdrawal
of
tycoon
steve
morgan
who
got
frustrated
by
failed
bids
and
what
he
claimed
was
indecision
by
the
board
he
also
accused
liverpool
of
using
him
as
a
stalking
horse
to
attract
other
bids
but
parry
explained
steve
has
never
been
used
as
a
stalking
horse
theres
no
need
and
that
is
not
the
way
we
do
business
we
had
discussions
with
steve
over
the
course
of
i
think
we
came
close
to
concluding
a
deal
in
the
summer
but
it
didnt
happen
quite
genuinely
the
new
interest
did
appear
relatively
late
in
the
day
just
prior
to
the
agm
in
december
and
as
i
have
said
it
was
of
such
potential
magnitude
and
that
potential
is
so
exciting
we
felt
we
had
to
evaluate
it
we
are
still
evaluating
it
steves
interest
was
taken
very
much
on
its
own
merits
his
enthusiasm
for
the
club
is
there
for
all
to
see
and
who
knows
what
the
next
few
months
will
hold
the
door
isnt
closed
on
anything
we
had
a
perfectly
sensible
dialogue
with
steve
last
year
we
have
a
common
interest
in
making
liverpool
successful
thats
a
dream
we
all
share
so
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
door
is
not
closed
i
would
take
â£m
if
we
had
no
investment
but
if
we
did
keep
him
as
for
the
stadium
if
it
gets
us
cash
what
difference
does
it
make
really
â£m
for
gerrard
i
dont
care
who
you
are
the
directors
would
take
the
money
and
it
is
the
way
it
should
be
we
can
not
let
that
sum
of
money
go
despite
gerrards
quality
through
a
cleverly
worded
statement
the
club
has
effectively
forced
gerrard
to
publicly
make
the
decision
for
himself
which
i
think
is
the
right
thing
to
do
critical
time
for
liverpool
with
regards
to
gerrard
ideally
we
would
want
to
secure
his
future
to
the
club
for
the
long
term
i
am
hoping
he
doesnt
walk
out
of
the
club
like
michael
owen
did
for
very
little
cash
â£m
realistically
would
allow
rafa
to
completely
rebuild
the
squad
however
if
we
can
afford
to
do
this
and
keep
gerrard
we
will
be
better
for
it
i
would
however
be
happy
with
gerrards
transfer
for
any
fee
over
â£m
parrys
statements
are
clever
in
that
any
future
gerrard
transfer
can
not
be
construed
as
a
lack
of
ambition
by
the
club
to
not
try
and
keep
their
best
players
upping
the
ante
is
another
smart
move
by
parry
i
would
keep
gerrard
no
amount
of
money
could
replace
his
obvious
love
of
the
club
and
determination
to
succeed
the
key
is
if
gerrard
comes
out
and
says
that
he
is
happy
clearly
if
he
isnt
then
we
would
be
foolish
not
to
sell
the
worrying
thing
is
who
would
you
buy
or
who
would
come
pending
possible
nonchampions
league
