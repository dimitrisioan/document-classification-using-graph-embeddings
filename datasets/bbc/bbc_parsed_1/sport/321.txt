eyes
brennan
for
lions
toulouses
former
irish
international
trevor
brennan
could
be
one
of
clive
woodwards
many
surprises
when
the
man
lions
tour
squad
is
announced
brennan
who
last
played
for
ireland
against
samoa
in
is
held
in
high
esteem
by
the
former
england
coach
if
you
speak
to
the
players
theres
a
huge
amount
of
respect
for
the
guy
woodward
told
the
sunday
independent
players
tend
to
know
better
than
most
coaches
its
not
just
the
irish
but
welsh
and
english
players
as
well
the
yearold
former
dublin
milkman
moved
from
leinster
to
toulouse
in
and
immediately
picked
up
a
heineken
cup
winners
medal
in
an
allfrench
final
against
perpignan
at
lansdowne
road
brennan
is
highlyrated
at
stade
toulousain
where
he
is
used
anywhere
in
the
back
five
woodward
is
ensuring
his
preparations
for
the
trip
to
new
zealand
in
june
are
as
thorough
as
possible
ive
spoken
to
quite
a
few
players
and
they
probably
dont
know
what
theyre
actually
saying
when
were
having
these
conversations
he
told
the
newspaper
but
you
talk
about
certain
players
and
theyll
say
if
they
think
theyre
up
to
scratch
or
that
they
dont
want
them
in
their
team
i
havent
heard
a
bad
word
said
against
trevor
which
considering
he
has
a
pretty
tough
guy
reputation
is
to
me
impressive
