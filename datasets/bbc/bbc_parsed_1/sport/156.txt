summer
move
for
owen
newcastle
boss
graeme
souness
is
lining
up
a
summer
move
for
england
and
real
madrid
striker
michael
owen
he
sees
owen
as
the
ideal
replacement
for
alan
shearer
who
is
due
to
retire
in
the
summer
although
he
hopes
to
persuade
shearer
to
carry
on
michael
is
in
the
category
of
players
who
would
excite
the
fans
and
were
monitoring
him
he
told
bbc
newcastle
he
is
a
great
centreforward
and
only
but
i
dont
think
were
the
only
ones
monitoring
the
situation
at
real
souness
has
also
hinted
he
thinks
shearer
may
carry
on
despite
his
stated
intent
to
retire
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
believes
the
prospect
of
breaking
jackie
milburns
club
scoring
record
may
influence
the
strikers
decision
milburn
scored
league
and
cup
goals
between
and
while
shearer
currently
has
goals
to
his
name
without
giving
too
much
away
i
am
confident
he
will
be
here
next
season
said
souness
i
cant
imagine
him
leaving
without
breaking
jackie
milburns
scoring
record
souness
also
revealed
he
tried
to
bring
back
nolberto
solano
during
the
january
transfer
window
the
peruvian
international
was
sold
to
aston
villa
a
year
ago
but
in
the
phonein
for
bbc
newcastle
souness
said
tried
to
resign
him
but
villa
were
not
interested
in
selling
the
former
rangers
and
liverpool
boss
is
also
looking
to
bring
in
a
number
of
new
acquisitions
once
the
current
campaign
has
been
completed
im
after
three
four
or
five
new
players
in
the
summer
we
have
got
lots
of
targets
he
said
dont
think
we
will
wait
to
the
last
day
of
the
season
to
say
who
are
we
going
to
target
now
