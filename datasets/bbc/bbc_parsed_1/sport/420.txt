oconnor
aims
to
grab
opportunity
johnny
oconnor
is
determined
to
make
a
big
impression
when
he
makes
his
rbs
six
nations
debut
for
ireland
against
scotland
on
saturday
the
wasps
flanker
replaces
denis
leamy
but
oconnor
knows
that
the
munster
man
will
be
pushing
hard
for
a
recall
for
the
following
game
against
england
its
a
horses
for
courses
selection
really
said
oconnor
theres
a
lot
of
competition
here
and
i
cant
just
drag
my
heels
around
if
i
dont
get
picked
it
looks
a
definite
headtohead
battle
between
himself
and
yearold
leamy
three
stone
heavier
than
oconnor
for
the
number
seven
role
against
the
world
champions
nonetheless
all
oconnor
is
currently
concerned
about
is
making
an
impression
while
winning
his
third
cap
missing
the
italian
game
was
disappointing
certainly
but
you
cant
dwell
on
these
things
its
part
and
parcel
of
rugby
denis
has
been
playing
really
well
and
deserved
his
opportunity
its
a
good
situation
to
be
in
if
there
are
good
players
around
you
pushing
for
a
place
in
the
side
oconnor
who
celebrated
his
th
birthday
on
wednesday
was
touted
by
wasps
director
of
rugby
warren
gatland
as
a
possible
lions
test
openside
as
far
back
as
last
september
and
his
reputation
as
a
breakdown
scavenger
and
heavy
hitter
has
seen
him
come
to
the
forefront
of
osullivans
mind
for
the
scottish
tussle
oconnor
added
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
situations
on
the
deck
is
reffed
with
the
new
laws
having
come
in
obviously
the
breakdown
a
big
part
of
what
i
do
on
the
pitch
so
im
hoping
to
hold
some
influence
there
against
what
is
a
very
solid
scottish
pack
oconnor
will
be
winning
his
third
cap
after
making
his
debut
in
the
victory
over
south
africa
last
november
