a
setback
when
she
failed

the

passed
up
the
chance
to
go

slam
with
wins
in

london
and
new

only
the

place
a
day
after

boston
is
definitely
a
race

do
at
some
point
but
london
is
very
special
to
me

pick
the

in
my
heart

really
want
to
do
i
love
the
atmosphere
crowds
and
course
and
know
it
will
always
be
a
great
quality
race
it
is
also
the
th
anniversary
this
year
which
adds
to
the
occasion
