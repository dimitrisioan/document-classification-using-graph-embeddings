davenport
has
criticised

reacting
to
a
disputed
comment
by
all

tim
phillips
the
american
said
i
think
it
is
highly
insulting
if

away
somebody
i
think
it
was
mr
phillips
said
they
wont
have
money
for
flowers
at
wimbledon
thats
insulting
an
all
england
club
spokesperson
denied
phillips
made
the
remark
insisting
he
definitely
didnt
say
it
the
statement
added
it
was
said
by
someone
else
and
was
a
humorous
aside
at
the
end
of
a
radio
interview
when
the
conversation
had
moved
to
talking
about
the
wimbledon
grounds
davenport
was
speaking
following
the
announcement
that
this
weeks
dubai
duty
free
event
will
join
the
us
and
australian
opens
in
offering
equal
prize
money
for
women
you
hear
about
women
playing
only
three
sets
while
men
play
five
said
daveport
and
the
best
women
are
never
going
to
beat
the
best
men
but
its
a
different
game
you
go
to
watch
with
the
women
it
doesnt
make
it
better
or
worse
hopefully
we
will
be
able
to
change
peoples
minds
serena
williams
who
is
also
in
dubai
added
im
obviously
for
equal
prize
money
womens
tennis
is
exciting
mens
tennis
is
exciting
as
well
but
the
women
have
it
right
now
if
you
are
bringing
in
the
spectators
you
should
be
able
to
reap
what
everyone
else
is
able
to
reap
