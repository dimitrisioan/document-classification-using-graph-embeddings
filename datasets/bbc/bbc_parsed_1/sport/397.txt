sculthorpe
wants
lions
captaincy
paul
sculthorpe
has
admitted
he
would
love
to
succeed
andy
farrell
as
great
britain
skipper
if
the
wigan
star
does
switch
codes
to
rugby
union
sculthorpe
was
vicecaptain
in
the
trinations
and
took
the
st
helens
captaincy
from
chris
joynt
last
year
i
would
definitely
want
the
job
i
make
no
bones
about
it
sculthorpe
told
bbc
sport
its
something
ive
always
wanted
to
do
id
gladly
take
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
the
yearold
who
captained
st
helens
to
challenge
cup
success
last
year
said
following
in
the
footsteps
of
farrell
would
be
a
challenge
andy
would
be
a
hard
act
to
follow
but
its
something
im
confident
of
being
up
to
he
said
the
gb
team
isnt
a
oneman
team
there
are
a
lot
of
good
young
players
who
are
pushing
for
places
anyway
sculthorpe
said
the
rugby
league
world
would
understand
if
farrell
did
decide
to
move
to
rugby
union
its
a
short
career
and
you
have
to
make
of
it
what
you
can
said
sculthorpe
nobody
can
blame
him
if
he
does
go
hes
done
everything
in
the
game
of
rugby
league
financially
it
could
set
him
up
for
life
if
he
fancies
a
new
challenge
then
who
could
fault
him
sculthorpe
also
called
on
the
rugby
league
authorities
to
have
a
serious
look
at
the
number
of
games
the
top
players
are
being
asked
to
play
sean
long
sculthorpes
saints
and
lions
teammate
has
expressed
doubts
about
his
international
future
i
think
seans
situation
is
to
do
with
the
sheer
number
of
games
were
playing
he
said
the
way
hes
looking
at
it
is
that
if
he
can
extend
his
career
by
a
couple
of
years
by
not
playing
international
rugby
then
hes
willing
to
do
that
the
rfl
has
got
to
do
something
about
the
fixtures
were
playing
weeks
of
the
year
and
its
too
much
a
lot
of
the
niggly
injuries
that
ive
suffered
with
over
the
last
couple
of
years
have
come
about
because
of
the
lack
of
rest
time
st
helens
have
been
strongly
linked
with
a
move
for
brilliant
young
forward
sonny
bill
williams
and
sculthorpe
said
he
would
love
the
yearold
to
come
to
knowsley
road
hes
a
great
player
a
big
strong
lad
who
can
certainly
hit
hard
in
defence
but
who
is
also
very
skilful
he
said
id
love
him
to
come
to
st
helens
who
knows
what
might
happen
but
you
want
the
best
players
in
your
team
and
hes
certainly
one
of
the
best
players
in
the
world
