wales
coach
elated
with
win
mike
ruddock
paid
tribute
to
his
wales
side
after
they
came
from
down
to
beat
france
in
the
six
nations
after
going
two
tries
down
in
minutes
we
had
to
show
character
said
the
national
team
coach
i
didnt
have
to
tell
them
anything
at
halftime
because
those
players
have
stared
down
the
barrel
of
a
gun
before
they
decided
they
didnt
want
to
do
that
again
and
came
out
fighting
it
was
a
great
team
effort
and
we
showed
great
character
to
come
back
manofthematch
stephen
jones
who
kicked
three
penalties
a
drop
goal
and
conversion
was
ecstatic
following
after
the
win
at
stade
de
france
its
just
a
special
moment
two
years
ago
we
didnt
win
a
single
game
in
the
six
nations
but
were
a
very
happy
camp
now
he
said
we
worked
hard
as
a
squad
and
im
a
proud
welshman
weve
got
hard
matches
to
come
so
were
just
happy
with
the
start
double
try
scorer
martyn
williams
was
keen
not
to
talk
about
a
possible
grand
slam
for
wales
weve
got
more
selfbelief
these
days
two
or
three
years
ago
we
might
have
collapsed
after
going
behind
so
early
theres
no
mention
of
a
grand
slam
among
the
players
weve
got
a
tough
game
against
scotland
at
murrayfield
they
could
bring
us
crashing
down
to
earth
