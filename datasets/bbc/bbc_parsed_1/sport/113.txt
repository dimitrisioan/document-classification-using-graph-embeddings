to
start
on
right
england
coach
svengoran
eriksson
has
revealed
shaun
wrightphillips
will
start
against
the
netherlands
but
wrightphillips
will
not
make
his
first
start
for
england
playing
on
the
left
as
had
been
widely
expected
shaun
wrightphillips
will
probably
start
the
game
said
eriksson
but
im
not
going
to
start
wrightphillips
on
the
left
eriksson
also
revealed
that
wes
brown
will
start
alongside
jamie
carragher
in
the
injuryhit
centre
of
defence
when
asked
if
brown
and
carragher
would
start
eriksson
replied
i
could
tell
you
yes
its
a
blow
that
four
or
five
central
defenders
are
away
because
of
injuries
on
the
other
hand
its
good
for
carragher
and
brown
to
show
what
they
can
do
at
this
level
thats
positive
the
england
coach
said
that
he
had
been
impressed
by
wrightphillips
form
for
manchester
city
he
deserves
his
chance
he
has
been
playing
well
all
season
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
him
and
he
added
that
andy
johnson
and
stewart
downing
the
other
two
new
players
in
the
squad
would
also
get
a
chance
to
impress
wrightphillips
downing
and
johnson
will
start
or
get
the
chance
to
play
some
part
johnson
was
not
in
my
plans
a
year
ago
but
he
is
doing
a
great
season
and
scoring
a
lot
of
goals
downing
is
another
one
making
a
great
season
he
is
young
talented
and
there
are
not
too
many
leftfooted
players
in
the
squad
