new

new
zealand
proved
too
strong
for
an
australiandominated
barbarians
to
round
off
their
unbeaten
northern
hemisphere
tour
with
an
easy
win
rico
gear
ran
in
two
of
the
all
blacks
seven
tries
in
what
was
a
predominantly
secondstring
lineup
the
baabaas
did
threaten
scoring
tries
through
albert
van
den
bergh
xavier
rush
and
andrea
lo
cicero
but
never
looked
like
winning
all
black
aaron
mauger
was
in
good
form
with
the
boot
adding
points
the
all
blacks
featured
only
two
of
the
side
which
started
last
weekends
emphatic
test
victory
over
france
in
paris
while
the
baabaas
had
nine
wallabies
in
their
starting
lineup
and
new
zealand
coach
graham
henry
said
it
was
a
quality
performance
against
a
very
experienced
side
and
a
number
of
young
guys
came
through
very
well
they
learnt
from
the
older
players
and
this
was
a
way
of
thanking
the
guys
who
had
been
mentoring
them
on
the
tour
but
the
running
rugby
the
crowd
had
been
hoping
for
rarely
materialised
marty
holah
got
the
all
blacks
onslaught
under
way
with
his
fifthminute
try
before
rush
hit
back
moments
later
but
new
zealand
went
ahead
once
more
as
gear
made
use
of
the
space
vacated
by
a
temporarily
injured
chris
latham
to
slide
in
maa
nonu
then
found
his
way
through
the
barbarians
defence
to
give
his
side
a
halftime
lead
the
hosts
failed
to
ignite
in
the
second
half
and
the
moment
gear
scored
his
second
just
after
the
interval
there
was
only
ever
going
to
be
one
winner
lo
cicero
the
sole
european
for
the
barbarians
bundled
over
for
a
try
to
briefly
curtail
the
deficit
but
the
match
was
blighted
by
controversy
moments
later
when
justin
marshall
was
felled
with
a
high
tackle
by
jimmy
cowan
referee
andy
turner
waved
play
on
and
casey
laulala
coasted
in
for
his
sides
fifth
try
jermoe
keino
and
piri
weepu
both
added
tries
to
the
all
blacks
tally
before
the
final
whistle
while
van
den
bergh
gained
some
consolation
for
the
baabaas
after
the
match
barbarians
coach
bob
dwyer
warned
that
south
african
flanker
schalk
burger
needed
a
proper
offseason
break
to
maintain
his
standards
burger
was
recently
crowned
player
of
the
year
by
both
his
peers
and
the
international
rugby
board
but
has
struggled
for
form
in
recent
weeks
its
his
first
year
at
that
level
and
he
was
phenomenal
up
until
the
end
of
the
southern
hemisphere
season
i
dont
think
hes
played
anywhere
near
that
level
on
tour
he
said
