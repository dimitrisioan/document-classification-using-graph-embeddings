tie
brentford
face
a
home
tie
against
holders
manchester
united
in
the
fa
cup
sixth
round
if
they
can
come
through
their
replay
against
southampton
the
league
one
side
held
the
saints
at
st
marys
in
their
fifthround
tie
and
were
rewarded
with
a
potential
draw
against
sir
alex
fergusons
side
newcastle
will
be
at
home
to
either
tottenham
or
nottingham
forest
bolton
host
arsenal
or
sheffield
united
and
leicester
will
visit
the
winners
of
the
burnley
and
blackburn
replay
the
ties
will
be
played
on
the
weekend
of
march
was
delighted
to
be
paired
with
united
although
he
admitted
they
still
have
plenty
of
work
to
do
to
set
up
a
dream
tie
weve
got
our
work
cut
out
next
tuesday
but
you
cant
deny
its
exciting
he
said
it
would
be
a
sellout
it
will
probably
be
on
television
we
have
financial
problems
and
the
revenue
it
could
bring
in
would
certainly
help
our
situation
were
happy
to
be
in
the
draw
but
weve
still
got
to
beat
a
premiership
team
weve
got
to
beat
southampton
first
and
thats
going
to
be
a
hard
game
but
if
we
do
there
will
be
some
celebration
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
face
united
were
not
counting
on
anything
yet
he
said
it
is
obviously
going
to
be
a
difficult
replay
judging
by
the
way
brentford
came
back
at
us
on
saturday
and
the
fact
that
united
have
come
out
of
the
hat
will
give
them
even
more
incentive
but
ive
been
drawn
against
united
so
many
times
in
cups
and
beaten
them
at
both
bournemouth
and
west
ham
there
are
no
easy
ties
in
the
fa
cup
and
im
sure
nobody
is
counting
on
one
newcastle
v
tottenham
or
nottingham
forest
southampton
or
brentford
v
manchester
united
bolton
v
arsenal
or
sheffield
united
burnley
or
blackburn
v
leicester
