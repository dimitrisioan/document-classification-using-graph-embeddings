boss
arsene
wenger
has
been
guaranteed
transfer
funds
to
boost
his
squad
the
summer
the
clubs
managing
director
keith
edelman
stressed
that
the
development
of
their
new
â£m
stadium
had
no
affect
on
wengers
spending
power
the
money
is
there
dont
worry
weve
got
it
edelman
told
bbc
sport
hopefully
well
spend
it
this
summer
and
in
the
coming
years
arsene
attends
all
our
board
meetings
and
he
knows
our
finances
are
very
strong
edelman
added
that
it
was
pointless
having
a
brand
new
stadium
if
the
team
did
not
match
the
surroundings
its
great
to
have
nice
new
surroundings
but
if
the
team
arent
performing
on
the
pitch
then
there
isnt
great
respect
in
having
a
fabulous
stadium
he
said
its
important
that
we
had
sufficient
funds
for
our
team
in
place
before
we
began
on
the
stadium
