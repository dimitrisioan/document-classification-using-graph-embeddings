defender
jaap
stam
says
manchester
united
know
they
made
a
mistake
by
selling
him
in
the
sides
meet
at
old
trafford
in
the
champions
league
game
on
wednesday
and
the
yearolds
dutchmans
presence
is
sure
to
add
spice
to
the
fixture
united
made
a
mistake
in
selling
me
stam
told
uefas
champions
magazine
i
was
settled
at
manchester
united
but
they
wanted
to
sell
me
if
a
club
want
to
sell
you
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
you
can
be
sold
like
cattle
sir
alex
ferguson
surprised
the
football
world
and
stam
by
selling
the
dutchman
to
lazio
for
â£m
in
august
the
decision
came
shortly
after
stam
claimed
in
his
autobiography
that
ferguson
had
tapped
him
up
when
he
was
at
psv
eindhoven
but
ferguson
insisted
he
sold
the
defender
because
the
transfer
fee
was
too
good
to
refuse
for
a
player
past
his
prime
the
affair
still
rankles
with
the
dutchman
i
was
settled
at
manchester
united
i
had
even
just
ordered
a
new
kitchen
but
they
wanted
to
sell
me
he
said
in
what
other
industry
can
a
good
employee
be
ushered
out
the
door
against
their
wishes
of
course
you
can
refuse
to
go
but
then
the
club
have
the
power
to
put
you
on
the
bench
i
dont
agree
that
players
control
the
game
there
have
been
opportunities
to
confront
them
in
the
newspapers
but
i
have
turned
them
down
whats
the
point
wednesdays
game
at
old
trafford
will
provide
an
intriguing
confrontation
between
uniteds
young
attackers
wayne
rooney
and
cristiano
ronaldo
and
milans
veteran
defence
of
stam
paolo
maldini
cafu
and
alessandro
costacurta
stam
says
rooneys
teenage
stardom
is
in
stark
contract
to
his
own
start
in
the
game
we
cant
all
be
wayne
rooneys
at
his
age
i
was
training
to
be
an
electrician
and
thought
my
chance
of
becoming
a
professional
footballer
had
gone
he
said
starting
late
can
be
a
good
thing
some
kids
who
start
early
get
bored
i
had
my
youth
having
fun
drinking
beers
blowing
up
milk
cannisters
it
sounds
strange
but
its
a
tradition
where
i
grew
up
in
kampen
and
i
had
done
all
the
things
i
wanted
to
do
