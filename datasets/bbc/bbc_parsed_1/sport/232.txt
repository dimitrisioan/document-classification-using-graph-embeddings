revealed
that
hoddle
was
one
of
the
first
to
be
approached
after
jones
departure
he
was
not
available
at
the
time
because
he
was
looking
at
various
other
things
he
explained
five
weeks
later
were
back
on
track
and
this
a
tremendous
opportunity
for
wolves

began
his
managerial
career

before
moving
on
to
chelsea

then
taking
up
the
england

his
spell
in
charge
of
the
national
side
came
to
an
end
after
the
world
cup
when
he
made
controversial
remarks
about
the
disabled
in
a
newspaper
interview
the
yearold
later
returned
to
management
with
southampton
where
he
again
succeeded
jones
as
he
has
now
done
at

engineered
an
upturn
in
saints
fortunes
before
being
lured
to
white
hart
lane
by
tottenham
the
club
where
he
made
his
name
as
a
player
that
relationship
turned
sour
at
the
start
of
the
last
campaign

he
left
the
london
club
early
last
season
since
