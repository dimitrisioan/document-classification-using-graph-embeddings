tuesday
march
gmt
barry
knight
kent
home
to
manchester
united
in
the
quarterfinals
midfielder
andrew
frampton
and
striker
deon
burton
are
both
slight
doubts
with
hamstring
injuries
but
should
be
fit
saints
are
missing
their
entire
firstchoice
midfield
of
jamie
redknapp
graeme
le
saux
nigel
quashie
and
david
prutton
anders
svensson
and
matt
oakley
are
likely
replacements
with
kevin
phillips
also
scheduled
to
start
with
henri
camara
rested
brentford
boss
martin
allen
after
conceding
eight
goals
in
our
last
three
matches
i
have
to
admit
im
not
very
confident
theres
no
doubt
were
the
underdogs
and
after
defending
so
poorly
recently
its
not
looking
good
southampton
have
just
drawn
with
the
premiership
champions
and
that
makes
our
task
harder
than
it
was
already
southampton
boss
harry
redknapp
we
know
they
can
give
us
problems
brentford
have
done
well
but
we
are
the
premiership
side
and
should
have
the
better
players
staying
in
the
premiership
is
our
priority
we
want
to
win
of
course
we
do
well
battle
but
if
it
comes
to
a
football
match
i
think
well
win
key
match
stats
brentford
are
the
lowest
ranked
club
left
in
the
fa
cup
theyre
on
their
best
run
in
the
competition
since
reaching
the
quarterfinals
for
the
fourth
time
in
their
history
years
ago
now
they
have
the
carrot
of
the
plum
draw
in
the
last
eight
dangling
before
them
victory
over
premiership
strugglers
southampton
would
bring
the
mighty
manchester
united
to
griffin
park
and
a
gigantic
pay
day
for
the
sole
league
one
survivors
martin
allens
brave
side
came
back
from
two
goals
down
at
st
marys
to
earn
a
deserved
replay
southampton
striker
henri
camara
scored
twice
from
close
range
to
put
the
saints
in
command
but
isaiah
rankin
hit
back
just
before
half
time
and
sam
sodje
headed
past
a
creaky
defence
on
minutes
the
londoners
have
conceded
six
goals
in
their
two
subsequent
league
outings
three
each
in
losing
away
to
hartlepool
and
drawing
at
home
to
sheffield
wednesday
but
they
havent
lost
in
six
league
and
cup
games
on
home
turf
winning
three
and
drawing
three
since
the
reverse
to
torquay
on
boxing
day
southampton
go
into
this
tie
on
the
back
of
an
eventful
premiership
match
with
arsenal
on
saturday
an
angry
david
prutton
pushed
referee
alan
wiley
after
being
shown
the
red
card
but
his
side
still
came
back
to
draw
it
was
saints
fourth
stalemate
in
succession
in
all
competitions
but
didnt
lift
them
out
of
the
relegation
zone
the
retention
of
their
ever
present
premier
league
status
must
be
the
number
one
priority
irrespective
of
the
rewards
that
success
against
brentford
would
bring
victory
here
would
set
up
a
repeat
of
the
final
when
saints
astounded
the
football
world
by
defeating
tommy
dochertys
manchester
united
courtesy
of
bobby
stokes
famous
winner
they
also
knocked
out
the
red
devils
in
on
penalties
in
the
fourth
round
but
to
write
another
chapter
in
their
fa
cup
history
the
solent
side
must
avoid
succumbing
to
lower
division
opposition
for
the
first
time
since
rotherham
from
the
second
level
beat
them
in
a
third
round
tie
at
millmoor
on
january
southampton
were
last
humbled
by
a
club
from
the
third
tier
six
years
ago
fulham
were
then
in
the
second
division
when
they
won
a
third
round
replay
at
craven
cottage
on
january
to
get
to
within
two
matches
of
a
second
visit
to
the
millennium
stadium
in
three
years
for
the
final
harry
redknapp
must
guide
his
side
past
a
club
places
inferior
on
the
league
ladder
and
a
manager
