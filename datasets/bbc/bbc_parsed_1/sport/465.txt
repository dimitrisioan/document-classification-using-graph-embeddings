tough
australian
open
title
defence
next
month
i
will
be
heading
to
australia
with
a
lot
of
question
marks
over
me
i
know
that
she
said
but
i
think
therell
be
less
pressure
than
last
time
even
if
i
am
champion
heninhardenne
was
speaking
after
a
loss
to
world
number
six
dementieva
in
charleroi
belgium
on
sunday
the
previous
day
the
olympic
champion
went
down
to
frances
nathalie
dechy
i
have
to
be
positive
i
still
have
a
few
weeks
she
said
my
body
has
to
get
accustomed
again
to
the
stress
the
rhythm
heninhardenne
slid
down
the
world
rankings
in
the
second
half
of
after
contracting
the
illness
in
april
after
an
initial
layoff
she
was
forced
off
the
circuit
for
a
second
time
after
being
knocked
out
of
the
french
open
in
the
second
round
a
comeback
at
the
us
open
after
a
threemonth
absence
ended
when
she
crashed
out
at
the
fourthround
stage
but
despite
her
problems
she
still
won
five
of
the
nine
official
tournaments
she
entered
in
and
won
olympic
gold
in
athens
an
achievement
which
saw
her
named
belgian
sportswoman
of
the
year
on
friday
physically
its
obvious
that
i
hit
rock
bottom
said
the
yearold
who
will
make
her
comeback
in
the
sydney
international
from
january
since
april
with
the
exception
of
the
olympics
i
have
not
done
much
all
the
successes
i
had
prior
to
that
were
mainly
due
to
the
work
i
put
in
on
building
up
my
fitness
now
its
time
to
get
back
to
putting
in
effort
and
i
think
i
am
capable
of
doing
that
