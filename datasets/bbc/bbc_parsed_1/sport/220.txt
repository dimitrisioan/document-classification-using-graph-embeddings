paid
tribute
to

johansson
after
beating
norwich
curbishley
said
after
the
win
there
was
talk
about
norwich
being
interested
in
the
summer
but
i
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
jonatan
when
there
was
talk
of
other
clubs
i
just
told
him
he
was
going
nowhere
hes
part
of
our
squad
and
he
got
us
a
couple
of
important
goals
early
on
im
sure
hes
happy
here
but
i
was
delighted
with
all
the
players
curbishley
was
subjected
to
criticism
from
charlton
fans
recently
and
he
said
the
thing
about
this
club
is
that
we
have
got
where
we
are
by
all
pulling
in
the
same
direction
thats
happened
for
however
long
ive
been
here
and
we
dont
want
people
taking
sides
