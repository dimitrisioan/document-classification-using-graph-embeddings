celtic
unhappy
over
bulgaria
date
martin
oneill
hopes
to
block
stilian
petrovs
callup
by
bulgaria
during
celtics
busy
festive
programme
the
celtic
manager
does
not
view
the
friendly
against
valenciana
a
region
of
spain
on
december
as
important
i
cant
say
i
was
overly
pleased
at
the
fixture
being
played
just
after
christmas
said
oneill
we
will
have
to
speak
with
the
bulgarian
fa
its
their
prerogative
for
them
to
arrange
a
fixture
and
our
prerogative
how
we
handle
it
bulgarias
game
comes
between
celtics
boxing
day
meeting
with
hearts
and
their
january
fixture
against
livingston
oneill
believes
the
extra
game
will
not
help
a
midfielder
whose
season
has
already
been
affected
by
injury
they
have
organised
a
game
at
a
rather
awkward
time
he
added
when
we
were
out
playing
barcelona
i
spoke
with
the
bulgarian
manager
hristo
stoichkov
and
he
mentioned
this
game
to
me
we
pay
his
wages
we
are
the
ones
that
if
an
awkward
fixture
is
going
to
be
played
at
some
stage
or
another
it
should
be
to
our
benefit
rather
than
anyone
else
i
have
said
this
before
but
bulgaria
are
the
one
nation
who
seem
to
organise
a
lot
of
friendly
games
