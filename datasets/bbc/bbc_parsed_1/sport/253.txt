old
firm
pair
handed
suspensions
celtics
henri
camara
and
nacho
novo
of
rangers
have
both
been
suspended
for
offences
missed
by
the
referee
in
a
recent
old
firm
game
both
were
given
automatic
onematch
bans
and
additional
disciplinary
points
for
their
actions
that
means
novo
will
miss
a
further
two
games
because
of
his
prior
record
camara
will
miss
one
additional
game
novo
was
found
guilty
of
stamping
on
celtics
stephen
pearson
camara
was
punished
for
kicking
gregory
vignal
im
extremely
disappointed
i
dont
know
if
theres
a
lot
to
add
to
that
said
rangers
manager
alex
mcleish
of
novos
punishment
but
what
i
will
say
is
that
im
at
a
loss
as
to
why
that
incident
should
be
picked
up
and
highlighted
when
there
were
so
many
other
incidents
during
the
game
both
players
will
miss
this
weekends
games
when
celtic
host
dundee
united
and
rangers
visit
kilmarnock
unless
they
decide
to
appeal
the
additional
bans
come
into
effect
from
december
meaning
camara
will
also
be
unavailable
for
the
home
game
against
livingston
while
novo
will
miss
the
meetings
with
dundee
united
and
dunfermline
an
sfa
spokesman
said
they
have
seven
days
to
appeal
but
with
matches
coming
along
at
the
weekend
they
would
need
to
do
so
before
friday
but
if
they
do
appeal
it
wont
be
heard
before
this
weekend
because
it
takes
a
bit
of
time
to
seat
up
an
appeals
tribunal
meanwhile
bob
malcolm
and
rangers
have
been
informed
by
letter
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
hearing
regarding
his
reaction
to
rangers
being
awarded
a
penalty
in
the
same
game
malcolm
a
substitute
on
the
day
was
taken
from
the
rangers
dugout
and
spoken
to
by
police
about
an
alleged
gesture
he
made
but
the
sfa
would
not
detail
what
if
any
punishment
malcolm
would
receive
once
rangers
receive
our
letter
we
will
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
comment
on
the
findings
added
the
spokesman
