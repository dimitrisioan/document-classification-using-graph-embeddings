wenger
keeping
faith
with
almunia
arsene
wenger
has
pledged
to
keep
faith
with
standin
keeper
manuel
almunia
for
the
crunch
week
which
could
define
arsenals
season
almunia
will
start
tuesdays
champions
league
group
tie
against
rosenborg
and
is
likely
to
face
chelsea
on
sunday
wenger
said
you
dont
think
i
would
take
out
one
goalkeeper
for
just
one
game
do
you
i
dont
do
that
i
have
to
give
him
a
run
for
a
few
games
its
just
that
i
dont
want
to
make
this
story
bigger
than
it
is
wenger
insists
he
has
complete
faith
in
the
yearold
spaniard
who
was
signed
last
summer
from
celta
vigo
as
backup
to
jens
lehmann
if
you
look
at
my
career
you
will
see
that
i
have
left
many
big
players
out
for
a
long
time
ive
done
it
with
dennis
bergkamp
kanu
everybody
its
because
its
a
goalkeeper
thats
all
its
a
usual
situation
for
me
you
put
your
best
team
out
no
matter
who
it
is
for
me
it
was
not
a
big
mistake
at
old
trafford
and
i
wasnt
alarmed
by
what
happened
against
birmingham
either
its
nothing
against
lehmann
i
think
hes
a
great
keeper
as
is
almunia
you
can
only
play
one
of
them
these
people
are
not
robots
they
have
good
periods
and
less
good
periods
just
because
lehmann
doesnt
play
for
two
or
three
weeks
or
longer
or
shorter
it
doesnt
mean
ive
lost
faith
in
him
but
former
arsenal
keeper
david
seaman
believes
lehmann
has
been
harshly
treated
seaman
told
the
daily
mail
jens
is
a
fantastic
keeper
he
deserves
another
chance
he
has
made
a
few
mistakes
but
on
form
he
deserves
to
be
the
firstteam
choice
with
arsenal
hit
by
injuries
and
suspension
inexperienced
midfield
pair
of
mathieu
flamini
and
cesc
fabregas
will
line
up
against
rosenborg
but
wenger
is
confident
they
will
prove
more
than
capable
it
puts
a
lot
of
pressure
on
them
but
its
a
good
learning
process
said
wenger
im
not
worried
as
they
are
both
mentally
strong
and
will
put
in
the
needed
workrate
the
gunners
go
into
the
game
boosted
by
the
news
that
defender
sol
campbell
is
on
the
verge
of
signing
a
new
deal
with
the
club
and
the
yearold
whose
current
contract
runs
out
in
the
summer
has
made
it
clear
he
is
determined
to
achieve
champions
league
success
with
arsenal
campbell
said
it
means
a
lot
to
me
to
go
through
its
everything
we
want
to
carry
on
in
this
competition
thats
where
the
best
teams
in
europe
are
to
be
in
there
playing
against
these
guys
and
trying
to
win
the
trophy
is
the
first
thing
in
my
mind
meanwhile
thierry
henry
believes
he
will
be
blamed
if
arsenal
fail
to
qualify
for
the
next
stage
of
the
champions
league
henry
will
captain
the
side
in
place
of
the
suspended
patrick
vieira
as
the
gunners
seek
the
required
victory
over
rosenborg
and
the
striker
said
if
we
dont
win
and
we
go
out
of
the
competition
like
it
or
not
its
going
to
be
my
fault
thats
the
way
it
is
if
the
team
dont
win
i
know
i
will
be
criticised
no
matter
how
i
play
