at
absent
stars
sale
sharks
director
of
rugby
philippe
saintandre
has
reopened
rugbys
clubversuscountry
debate
sale
host
bath
in
the
powergen
cup
on
friday
but
the
frenchman
has
endured
a
difficult
week
with
six
players
away
on
englands
six
nations
training
camp
its
an
important
game
but
weve
just
the
one
full
session
its
the
same
for
everyone
but
we
need
to
manage
it
if
five
players
or
more
are
picked
for
your
country
they
should
move
the
date
of
the
game
he
told
bbc
sport
unless
the
authorities
agree
to
make
changes
saintandre
believes
englands
national
team
will
suffer
as
clubs
opt
to
sign
foreigners
and
retired
internationals
thats
not
good
for
the
politics
of
the
english
team
or
for
english
rugby
he
argues
it
is
an
issue
he
has
taken
up
before
most
notably
during
the
autumn
internationals
when
sale
lost
all
three
zurich
premiership
matches
they
played
now
he
fears
it
could
derail
the
clubs
hopes
of
cup
silverware
after
eight
players
including
captain
jason
robinson
and
flyhalf
charlie
hodgson
were
away
with
their
countries
were
in
the
quarterfinals
its
always
better
to
play
at
home
than
away
and
its
a
great
opportunity
he
added
but
we
have
to
be
careful
bath
have
just
been
knocked
out
of
europe
and
will
make
it
a
tough
game
it
also
comes
at
the
end
of
a
very
very
difficult
week
sebastien
brunos
been
with
france
jason
white
with
scotland
and
there
are
six
with
england
thats
eight
players
plus
injuries
players
out
of
a
squad
of
well
have
just
one
session
together
and
will
have
to
do
our
best
to
make
that
a
good
one
on
thursday
afternoon
gloucester
have
also
been
caught
in
a
clubversuscountry
conflict
after
england
sought
a
second
medical
opinion
on
james
simpsondaniels
fitness
the
winger
is
carrying
a
shoulder
injury
and
the
national
team
management
believe
he
requires
time
on
the
sidelines
as
a
result
he
misses
the
cherry
and
whites
quarterfinal
at
home
to
bristol
under
the
elite
player
squad
agreement
england
wanted
a
second
opinion
which
they
can
do
director
of
rugby
nigel
melville
told
the
gloucester
citizen
they
obviously
want
him
for
international
rugby
and
we
want
him
for
club
rugby
in
what
is
a
very
important
game
for
us
there
is
a
conflict
of
interests
the
surgeon
who
carried
out
his
operation
said
he
was
fine
for
us
but
england
say
he
is
still
vulnerable
to
be
damaged
again
and
want
him
on
a
full
rehab
programme
simpsondaniel
added
ive
said
to
nigel
i
want
to
be
back
playing
and
that
means
if
everything
goes
well
this
week
i
can
target
the
worcester
game
on
january
for
a
return
