angered
by
racism
fine
spain
coach
luis
aragones
is
furious
after
being
fined
by
the
spanish
football
federation
for
his
comments
about
thierry
henry
the
yearold
criticised
his
euros
â£
punishment
even
though
it
was
far
below
the
maximum
penalty
i
am
not
guilty
nor
do
i
accept
being
judged
for
actions
against
the
image
of
the
sport
he
said
im
not
a
racist
and
ive
never
lacked
sporting
decorum
ive
never
done
that
and
i
have
medals
for
sporting
merit
aragones
was
handed
the
fine
on
tuesday
after
making
racist
remarks
about
henry
to
arsenal
teammate
and
spanish
international
jose
reyes
last
october
the
spanish
football
federation
at
first
declined
to
take
action
against
aragones
but
was
then
requested
to
do
so
by
spains
antiviolence
commission
the
fine
was
far
less
than
the
expected
amount
of
about
â£
or
even
the
suspension
of
his
coaching
licence
arsenal
boss
arsene
wenger
who
was
fined
â£
in
december
for
accusing
manchester
united
striker
ruud
van
nistelrooy
of
cheating
believes
that
aragones
punishment
was
too
lenient
you
compare
his
fine
and
my
fine
and
if
you
consider
his
was
for
racist
abuse
then
you
seem
to
get
away
with
it
more
in
spain
than
you
should
wenger
said
he
shouldnt
have
said
what
he
said
and
how
much
money
is
enough
i
dont
know
but
it
doesnt
look
a
big
punishment
however
aragones
insists
the
fine
is
unjustified
and
unfair
i
have
been
treated
like
islero
the
bull
that
killed
famous
bullfighter
manolete
said
aragones
on
hearing
he
had
been
fined
for
his
actions
i
have
not
liked
one
thing
about
this
whole
affair
and
i
do
not
agree
with
the
sanction
they
have
looked
for
a
scapegoat
spains
antiviolence
commission
must
now
ratify
the
spanish
fas
decision
and
has
until
next
week
to
announce
its
verdict
aragones
has
days
to
appeal
and
the
commission
can
also
appeal
alberto
flores
president
of
the
spanish
fas
disciplinary
committee
said
noone
in
the
committee
felt
aragones
was
a
racist
nor
had
acted
in
a
racist
way
a
fine
the
highest
we
could
apply
is
sufficient
punishment
suspension
would
have
been
a
bit
exaggerated
