the
spanish
goalkeeper
saved
from
alan
quinn
and
jon
harley
as
arsenal
sealed
a
quarterfinal
trip
to
bolton
with
a
victory
on
penalties
lauren

vieira
freddie
ljungberg
and
ashley
cole
scored
for
arsenal
while
andy
gray
and
phil
jagielka
were
on
target
for
the
blades
michael
tonge
and
harley
wasted
chances
for
the
underdogs
but
paddy
kenny
was
inspired
to
keep
arsenal
at
bay
arsenal
stripped
of
attacking
talent
such
as
thierry
henry
and
dennis
bergkamp
partnered
yearold
italian
striker
arturo
lupoli
with
ljungberg
up
front
it
was
a
revamped
arsenal
lineup
and
they
were
almost
a
goal
behind
within
seconds
as
tonge
wasted
a
glorious
chance
gray
ran
free
down
the
right
flank
and
his
cross
left
tonge
with
the
simplest
of
chances
but
he
blazed
over
the
top
from
six
yards
arsenal
were
barely
seen
as
an
attacking
force
in
the
opening
minutes
although
ljungberg
turned
a
halfchance
wide
after
good
work
by
cesc
fabregas
arsene
wenger
introduced
quincy
owusuabeyie
for
the
ineffective
lupoli
at
halftime
and
the
pacy
dutch
youngster
had
an
immediate
impact
he
ran
clear
after
good
work
by
mathieu
flamini
but
his
finish
was
tame
and
kenny
saved
easily
owusuabeyie
then
fired
in
a
testing
cross
which
was
met
by
fabregas
and
it
needed
a
desperate
clearance
by
kennys
legs
to
save
the
blades
arsenal
were
now
totally
dominant
and
were
desperately
unlucky
not
to
take
the
lead
after
minutes
when
fabregas
crashed
a
rising
drive
against
the
bar
from
yards
it
then
took
a
brilliant
tackle
by
jagielka
to
deny
ljungberg
as
he
was
poised
to
strike
arsenal
continued
to
press
and
once
again
kenny
was
called
into
action
with
eight
minutes
left
diving
low
to
clutch
another
closerange
effort
from
fabregas
neil
warnocks
side
almost
snatched
victory
in
the
dying
seconds
when
derek
gearys
cross
found
harley
at
the
far
post
but
his
diving
header
was
brilliantly
turned
over
by
almunia
owusuabeyies
pace
was
causing
all
sorts
of
problems
for
the
blades
and
as
extratime
began
another
surging
run
into
the
penalty
area
almost
set
up
a
chance
for
ljungberg
pascal
cygan
missed
arsenals
best
chance
after
minutes
blazing
across
the
face
of
goal
when
he
was
unmarked
at
the
far
post
arsenal
sent
on
jeremie
aliadiere
with
seven
minutes
of
extratime
left
and
he
almost
broke
the
deadlock
with
his
first
touch
kolo
toures
misplaced
freekick
landed
at
his
feet
but
kenny
once
again
blocked
from
a
tight
angle
arsenal
laid
siege
to
sheffield
uniteds
goal
in
the
dying
minutes
but
they
somehow
held
on
to
force
penalties
almunia
was
then
arsenals
hero
as
another
brave
