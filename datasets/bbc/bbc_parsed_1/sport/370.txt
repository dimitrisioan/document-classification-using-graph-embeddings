has
targeted
dual
code
success
over
australia
on
saturday
robinson
a
former
rugby
league
international
before
switching
codes
in
leads
england
against
australia
at
twickenham
at
gmt
and
at
gmt
great
britains
rugby
league
team
take
on
australia
in
the
final
of
the
trinations
tournament
beating
the
aussies
in
both
games
would
be
a
massive
achievement
especially
for
league
said
robinson
england
have
the
chance
to
seal
their
third
autumn
international
victory
after
successive
wins
over
canada
and
south
africa
as
well
as
gaining
revenge
for
junes
hammering
by
the
wallabies
meanwhile
great
britain
could
end
years
of
failure
against
australia
with
victory
at
elland
road
britain
have
won
individual
test
matches
but
have
failed
to
secure
any
silverware
or
win
the
ashes
with
a
series
victory
since
they
have
a
great
opportunity
to
land
a
trophy
and
it
would
be
a
massive
boost
for
rugby
league
in
this
country
if
we
won
said
robinson
i
know
the
boys
can
do
it
theyve
defeated
the
aussies
once
already
in
the
trinations
but
robinson
was
not
losing
sight
of
the
task
facing
his
england
side
in
their
final
autumn
international
for
us
weve
played
two
and
won
two
this
november
he
said
if
we
beat
australia
it
would
be
the
end
to
a
great
autumn
series
for
england
if
we
stumble
then
well
be
looking
back
with
a
few
regrets
robinson
also
revealed
that
the
union
side
had
sent
the
great
britain
team
a
good
luck
message
ahead
of
the
showdown
in
leeds
we
signed
a
card
for
them
today
and
will
write
them
an
email
on
saturday
wishing
them
all
the
best
said
robinson
everyone
has
signed
the
card
a
lot
of
the
guys
watch
league
and
we
support
them
fully
both
games
will
be
very
tough
and
hopefully
well
both
do
well
