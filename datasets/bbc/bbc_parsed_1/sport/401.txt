wales
hails
new
superstar
one
game
into
his
six
nations
career
and
gavin
henson
is
already
a
welsh
legend
a
mesmeric
display
against
england
topped
off
by
his
howitzer
of
a
matchwinning
penalty
has
secured
life
membership
of
that
particular
club
at
henson
has
the
rugby
world
at
his
silverbooted
feet
and
if
his
natural
selfassurance
and
swagger
is
shared
by
his
wales
teammates
then
a
fullblown
revival
could
be
more
than
just
a
lot
of
hot
air
drifting
up
from
the
valleys
the
red
dragonhood
subdued
the
red
rose
army
in
most
areas
of
the
field
but
hensons
stellar
performance
ensured
their
efforts
yielded
the
win
they
craved
above
all
others
he
announced
himself
in
the
games
opening
salvo
with
a
welcome
to
cardiff
greeting
for
mark
cueto
on
the
gain
line
and
his
defence
was
a
major
feature
of
the
match
his
principal
victim
poor
old
or
rather
young
mathew
tait
the
england
centre
will
have
spent
his
th
birthday
on
sunday
shuddering
at
the
memory
of
how
he
was
upended
not
just
once
but
twice
by
hensons
allenveloping
tackles
the
second
time
after
the
interval
singlehandedly
lifted
the
record
millennium
stadium
crowd
at
a
time
when
england
were
starting
to
show
menace
showing
awesome
strength
henson
nonchantly
held
the
bewildered
debutant
in
midair
a
master
predator
toying
with
his
helpless
prey
savouring
the
kill
his
kicking
game
also
prospered
particularly
when
he
moved
to
fullback
for
minutes
either
side
of
halftime
when
his
captain
gareth
thomas
was
in
the
sinbin
one
huge
clearance
from
taits
kick
sent
england
retreating
rapidly
while
another
booming
punt
to
the
right
corner
kept
the
visitors
pinned
in
their
own
half
henson
was
also
creativity
personified
one
little
chip
ahead
for
shane
williams
narrowly
missed
its
target
a
precise
crosskick
forcing
jamie
noon
to
fumble
the
ball
into
touch
he
also
had
a
hand
in
the
games
only
try
finished
superbly
by
williams
and
might
have
scored
himself
on
the
halfhour
as
he
glided
into
space
only
to
be
scragged
by
tait
henson
was
twice
repelled
as
wales
laid
siege
to
the
english
line
after
charlie
hodgsons
penalty
had
edged
the
visitors
in
front
for
the
first
time
but
he
was
not
to
be
denied
as
the
crescendo
rose
to
a
deafening
din
and
the
outcome
of
the
match
fell
to
him
replacement
gareth
cooper
made
the
most
of
a
poor
welsh
scrum
by
chipping
into
space
where
jason
robinson
was
penalised
for
holding
on
in
the
tackle
five
metres
in
from
the
right
touchline
metres
out
it
was
not
a
kick
stephen
jones
who
had
seen
a
longrange
effort
fall
agonisingly
under
the
bar
would
have
approached
with
confidence
it
was
out
of
steves
range
but
i
looked
at
gavin
and
he
gave
me
a
reassuring
nod
said
thomas
henson
surveying
his
date
with
destiny
positively
relished
the
responsibility
and
the
chance
to
make
himself
a
hero
without
further
ado
he
nervelessly
slotted
the
kick
that
ended
five
years
of
english
dominance
and
years
of
waiting
in
cardiff
i
knew
i
was
going
to
get
it
before
i
even
took
the
kick
he
said
later
his
distinct
spikey
locks
freshly
gelled
into
an
appropriate
star
shape
i
have
been
getting
them
from
that
distance
all
year
so
it
wasnt
a
problem
there
were
still
four
minutes
for
wales
to
hold
out
and
the
frenzy
was
such
that
henson
could
not
even
hear
jones
shouting
instructions
at
him
from
three
yards
away
but
it
was
wales
who
finished
the
game
on
the
attack
almost
snatching
a
second
try
in
a
thunderous
climax
just
do
it
implored
the
front
page
headline
on
saturdays
western
mail
newspaper
and
thanks
to
henson
wales
