ashley
cole
has
refused
to
blame
robin
van
persie
for
leaving
arsenal
with
no
fullyfit
strikers
for
the
fa
cup
fifth
round
replay
at
sheffield
united
van
persie
is
suspended
alongside
dennis
bergkamp
and
jose
antonio
reyes
after
being
sent
off
at
southampton
when
arsenal
had
a
numerical
advantage
thierry
henry
is
ruled
out
with
an
achilles
tendon
injury
but
cole
said
noone
is
putting
the
blame
on
robin
its
just
something
that
happens
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
cole
added
ive
done
it
before
and
i
hope
they
didnt
blame
me
for
anything
of
course
hell
learn
ive
been
sent
off
a
couple
of
times
now
and
its
just
one
of
those
things
when
you
go
a
bit
crazy
for
one
or
two
seconds
freddie
ljungberg
is
likely
to
be
used
in
an
emergency
striking
role
and
will
be
partnered
by
either
arturo
lupoli
quincy
owusuabeyie
or
jeremie
aliadiere
gunners
boss
arsene
wenger
said
freddie
is
an
option
but
we
need
a
second
striker
i
have
to
decide
whether
it
will
be
aliadiere
quincy
or
lupoli
who
will
start
with
him
up
front
those
three
will
be
involved
arsenal
are
also
without
winger
robert
pires
who
sustained
an
ankle
injury
at
st
marys
wenger
added
it
doesnt
look
like
anything
is
fractured
but
it
is
a
good
ankle
sprain
it
does
not
look
like
pires
will
be
ready
for
two
to
three
weeks
