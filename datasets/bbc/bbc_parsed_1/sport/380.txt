by

ogara
stole
victory
for
ireland
from
underneath
the
noses
of
argentina
at
lansdowne
road
on
saturday
ogara
kicked
all
of
irelands
points
with
two
dropped
goals
and
five
penalties
to
give
the
home
side
a
record
in
their
autumn
internationals
an
impressive
argentina
appeared
in
control
until
the
dying
seconds
the
pumas
shocked
the
irish
early
on
with
a
try
from
federico
aramburu
and
felipe
contepomi
kicked
points
the
welldrilled
and
sharper
pumas
outplayed
and
outthought
ireland
in
the
early
stages
indiscipline
allowed
argentinas
leinster
flyhalf
contepomi
to
open
the
scoring
in
the
third
minute
with
a
straightforward
penalty
he
was
on
the
mark
again
two
minutes
later
when
argentina
shocked
a
ragged
ireland
with
the
first
try
of
the
game
ireland
turned
the
ball
over
and
manuel
contepomi
broke
through
an
unstructured
defence
before
feeding
his
midfield
partner
aramburu
to
sprint
in
under
the
posts
ogara
finally
got
ireland
on
the
board
with
a
dropped
goal
in
the
ninth
minute
only
for
contepomi
to
rifle
over
his
second
penalty
two
minutes
later
playing
into
a
strong
wind
and
rain
ireland
continued
to
come
second
best
in
tight
situations
and
turnovers
began
to
mount
up
against
a
rugged
defence
ogara
managed
to
land
his
second
penalty
in
the
th
minute
but
once
again
contepomi
replied
in
kind
four
minutes
into
firsthalf
injury
time
the
secondhalf
started
as
the
first
had
ended
ogara
rifled
over
another
penalty
in
the
th
minute
but
contepomi
matched
it
three
minutes
later
the
upperbody
strength
of
the
pumas
never
allowed
ireland
to
take
control
up
front
while
the
threequarters
had
no
space
to
manoeuvre
ireland
had
to
rely
on
ogaras
boot
to
keep
in
touch
rather
than
any
contrived
running
plays
the
munsterman
landed
two
more
penalties
one
of
them
from
metres
to
bring
his
team
to
within
four
points
with
minutes
on
the
clock
remaining
and
irelands
chance
came
when
argentinas
number
eight
gonzalo
longo
was
yellow
carded
with
six
minutes
to
go
for
an
offence
in
the
lineout
ogara
made
no
mistake
as
he
rifled
over
his
fifth
penalty
to
set
up
a
tense
final
few
minutes
but
ireland
showed
great
composure
to
get
themselves
into
a
position
to
allow
ogara
to
thump
over
a
massive
drop
goal
to
complete
a
tremendous
if
fortuitous
comeback
