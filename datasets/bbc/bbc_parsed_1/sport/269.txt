neil

after

given
on

hour
newcastle
then
had
lee

sent
off
for
two
bookable
offences
liverpool
brought
back
luis
garcia
after
a
hamstring
injury
while
newcastle
were
forced
to
draft
in
kluivert
after
craig
bellamy
was
a
late
withdrawal
with
a
back
injury
sustained
in
the
warmup
and
garcia
should
have
crowned
his
return
with
a
goal
inside
the
opening
minute
when
he
took
a
pass
from
baros
but
shot
wildly
over
the
top
from
eight
yards
olivier
bernard
was
only
inches
away
from
giving
newcastle
the
lead
after
minutes
when
he
fired
just
wide
from
a
freekick
yards
out
but
sounesss
side
did
go
ahead
minutes
later
in
highly
controversial
circumstances
kluivert
looked
suspiciously
offside
when
kieron
dyer
set
bowyer
free
but
the
dutchman
was
then
perfectly
placed
to
score
from
six
yards
the
lead
lasted
three
minutes
with
liverpool
back
on
terms
as
bramble
headed
gerrards
corner
into
his
own
net
under
pressure
from
sami
hyypia
and
liverpool
were
ahead
after
minutes
when
baros
slid
a
perfect
pass
into
mellors
path
for
the
youngster
to
slip
a
sliderule
finish
into
givens
bottom
corner
garcias
finishing
was
wayward
and
he
was
wasteful
again
in
firsthalf
injury
time
shooting
tamely
at
given
after
good
work
by
xabi
alonso
any
hopes
of
a
newcastle
recovery
looked
to
be
snuffed
out
on
the
hour
when
a
brilliant
turn
and
pass
by
harry
kewell
set
baros
free
and
he
rounded
given
to
score
jermaine
jenas
then
missed
a
glorious
chance
to
throw
newcastle
a
lifeline
shooting
over
from
just
eight
yards
out
from
shola
ameobis
cross
then
bowyer
who
had
already
been
booked
for
