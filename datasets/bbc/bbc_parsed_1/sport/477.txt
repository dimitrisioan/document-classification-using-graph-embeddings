moya
suffers
shock
loss
fifth
seed
carlos
moya
was
the
first
big
name
to
fall
at
the
australian
open
as
he
went
down
to
fellow
spaniard
guillermo
garcialopez
on
monday
moya
began
the
year
with
victory
at
the
chennai
open
but
looked
out
of
sorts
from
the
start
in
the
melbourne
heat
garcialopez
ranked
in
the
world
dominated
from
the
outset
and
withstood
a
thirdset
rally
from
moya
to
hang
on
for
a
victory
the
yearold
plays
kevin
kim
or
lee
hyuungtaik
in
the
second
round
garcialopez
was
delighted
with
the
victory
in
only
his
third
ever
grand
slam
match
i
think
this
was
the
most
important
win
of
my
life
as
carlos
is
one
of
the
best
players
in
the
world
he
said
this
has
given
me
a
lot
of
confidence
now
i
feel
i
can
beat
all
these
players
moya
said
i
was
playing
well
before
i
came
here
it
was
the
perfect
preparation
but
something
was
wrong
today
fourtime
champion
andre
agassi
began
what
could
be
his
last
australian
open
with
a
convincing
win
over
german
qualifier
dieter
kindlmann
the
yearold
american
who
had
been
struggling
with
a
hip
injury
earlier
in
the
week
stormed
to
a
win
agassi
will
play
frances
olivier
patience
or
germanys
rainer
schuettler
the
man
he
beat
in
the
final
in
the
next
round
no
one
was
more
concerned
about
the
injury
than
myself
said
eighth
seed
agassi
id
worked
hard
to
be
down
here
and

but
the

it
seemed
to
do
pretty
good
in
other
matches
