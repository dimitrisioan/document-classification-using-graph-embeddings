scrumhalf
dimitri
yachvili
praised
his
team
after
they
fought
back
to
beat
england
in
the
six
nations
clash
at
twickenham
yachvili
kicked
all
of
frances
points
as
they
staged
a
secondhalf
revival
we
didnt
play
last
week
against
scotland
and
we
didnt
play
in
the
first
half
against
england
he
said
but
were
very
proud
to
beat
england
at
twickenham
we
were
just
defending
in
the
first
half
and
we
said
we
had
to
put
them
under
pressure
we
did
well
yachvili
admitted
erratic
kicking
from
englands
charlie
hodgson
and
olly
barkley
who
missed
six
penalties
and
a
drop
goal
chance
between
them
had
been
decisive
i
know
what
its
like
with
kicking
when
you
miss
some
its
very
hard
mentally
but
it
went
well
for
us
he
said
france
captain
fabien
pelous
insisted
his
side
never
doubted
they
could
secure
their
first
win
against
england
at
twickenham
since
france
were
down
at
halftime
but
pelous
said
noone
was
down
at
halftime
we
were
still
confident
we
said
we
only
had
points
against
us
which
was
not
much
the
plan
was
to
keep
hold
of
possession
and
pressure
england
to
losing
their
composure
france
coach
bernard
laporte
accepted
his
side
had
not
played
well
we
know
we
have
to
play
better
to
defend
the
title
he
said
im
not
happy
we
didnt
score
a
try
but
were
happy
because
we
won
