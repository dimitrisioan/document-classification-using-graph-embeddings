safin
cool
on
wimbledon
newlycrowned
australian
open
champion
marat
safin
has
ruled
out
any
chance
of
winning
wimbledon
in
the
future
after
losing
in
round
one
last
year
safin
said
he
had
given
up
on
wimbledon
and
winning
his
second
grand
slam
title
has
not
changed
his
mind
ill
play
but
with
no
expectations
i
feel
like
i
cant
waste
my
time
my
energy
on
that
surface
he
said
some
people
they
can
not
play
on
clay
some
people
they
can
not
play
on
a
hard
court
me
i
cant
play
on
grass
however
safin
is
hopeful
that
winning
the
australian
open
will
give
him
the
belief
he
needs
to
win
more
grand
slam
titles
its
a
relief
for
me
two
grand
slams
its
already
something
but
with
this
one
i
worked
really
hard
for
it
he
said
basically
i
would
love
to
win
a
couple
more
i
think
i
have
a
chance
if
i
continue
this
way
if
coach
peter
lundgren
will
stick
around
with
me
and
wants
to
work
with
me
for
a
bit
longer
i
think
i
can
make
it
the
yearold
shocked
pete
sampras
in
the
us
open
final
to
win
his
first
major
title
but
then
lost
in
two
australian
open
finals
safin
admitted
he
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
he
would
win
another
grand
slam
i
didnt
expect
that
to
win
the
us
open
it
was
against
sampras
i
wasnt
the
favourite
so
i
had
no
pressure
whatsoever
he
said
after
the
first
final
that
i
didnt
win
against
thomas
johansson
in
i
couldnt
see
myself
winning
the
grand
slams
anymore
i
was
once
in
the
semifinals
of
the
french
open
but
i
didnt
believe
i
can
win
it
i
just
couldnt
handle
the
pressure
you
need
to
believe
in
yourself
and
i
didnt
and
after
losing
the
first
set
to
lleyton
hewitt
in
sundays
final
safin
said
he
began
to
doubt
himself
again
i
am
im
playing
against
hewitt
at
least
you
have
to
have
the
opportunity
to
win
it
at
least
have
a
chance
he
said
its
like
you
go
there
and
you
lose
first
set
then
you
start
to
think
this
is
not
my
day
the
way
im
playing
is
ridiculous
but
then
you
start
to
really
be
a
little
bit
more
selfish
and
try
to
find
a
way
out
of
there
and
i
found
it
i
was
like
really
much
i
was
much
happier
than
in
thats
for
sure
because
i
get
over
it
