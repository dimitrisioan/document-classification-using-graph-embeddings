moya
emotional
after
davis
cup
win
carlos
moya
described
spains
davis
cup
victory
as
the
highlight
of
his
career
after
he
beat
andy
roddick
to
end
the
usas
challenge
in
seville
moya
made
up
for
missing
spains
victory
through
injury
by
beating
roddick
to
give
the
hosts
an
unassailable
lead
i
have
woken
up
so
many
nights
dreaming
of
this
day
said
moya
all
my
energy
has
been
focused
on
today
what
i
have
lived
today
i
do
not
think
i
will
live
again
spains
only
other
davis
cup
title
came
two
years
ago
in
valencia
when
they
beat
australia
and
moya
nicknamed
charly
admitted
the
davis
cup
is
my
dream
and
i
was
a
bit
nervous
at
the
outset
some
people
have
said
that
i
am
obsessed
but
i
think
that
it
is
better
this
way
it
helps
me
reach
my
goals
if
i
am
obsessed
its
really
incredible
to
get
the
winning
point
is
really
something
spanish
captain
jordi
arrese
said
charly
played
a
great
game
it
was
his
opportunity
and
he
hasnt
let
us
down
he
had
lost
three
times
to
roddick
and
this
was
his
day
to
beat
him
he
had
been
waiting
years
to
be
in
this
position
spains
victory
was
also
remarkable
for
the
performance
of
rafael
nadal
who
beat
roddick
in
the
opening
singles
aged
years
and
days
the
mallorcan
became
the
youngest
player
to
win
the
davis
cup
what
a
great
way
to
finish
the
year
said
nadal
afterwards
us
coach
patrick
mcenroe
wants
roddick
and
the
rest
of
his
team
to
play
more
tennis
on
clay
and
hone
their
skills
on
the
surface
i
think
it
will
help
these
guys
even
on
slow
hard
courts
to
learn
how
to
mix
things
up
a
little
bit
and
to
play
a
little
bit
smarter
and
tactically
better
obviously
its
unrealistic
to
say
that
were
going
to
just
start
playing
constantly
on
clay
with
the
schedule
but
certainly
i
think
we
can
put
the
work
in
at
the
appropriate
time
and
play
a
couple
more
events
and
play
against
these
guys
who
are
the
best
on
this
stuff
said
mcenroe
roddick
was
left
frustrated
after
losing
both
his
singles
on
the
slow
clay
of
sevilles
olympic
stadium
its
just
tough
because
i
felt
like
i
was
in
it
the
whole
time
against
one
of
the
top
three
claycourters
in
the
world
said
the
american
i
had
my
chances
and
just
didnt
convert
them
the
bottom
line
is
they
were
just
better
than
us
this
weekend
they
came
out
took
care
of
business
and
they
beat
us
its
as
simple
as
that
