wales
make
two
changes
for
france
wales
coach
mike
ruddock
has
made
two
changes
from
the
team
that
beat
italy
for
saturdays
trip
to
france
kevin
morgan
takes
over
from
his
injured
newportgwent
dragons
colleague
hal
luscombe
on
the
right
wing
and
in
the
pack
neathswansea
ospreys
forward
ryan
jones
is
preferred
at
blindside
flanker
to
jonathan
thomas
thomas
a
tryscorer
in
rome
drops
down
to
the
bench
instead
of
ian
gough
while
cardiff
back
rhys
williams
steps
up
in
place
of
morgan
luscombe
is
sidelined
by
a
hamstring
problem
sustained
during
the
six
nations
game
against
italy
last
weekend
however
the
experienced
and
inform
morgan
was
already
pushing
hard
for
a
start
at
stade
de
france
due
to
his
impressive
performances
from
the
bench
kevin
was
very
much
in
the
selection
mix
anyway
and
the
unfortunate
injury
to
hal
gives
him
the
chance
to
start
said
ruddock
now
that
ryan
jones
has
recovered
from
injury
we
have
increased
the
options
in
the
back
row
jonathan
thomas
is
unlucky
to
lose
his
spot
after
performing
well
against
italy
and
scoring
a
try
but
such
is
the
competition
for
places
that
every
position
is
debated
in
detail
for
this
particular
game
we
felt
we
might
not
always
be
afforded
the
open
spaces
out
wide
we
were
able
to
exploit
against
italy
so
an
extra
big
ballcarrier
in
the
backrow
is
thought
to
be
necessary
on
this
occasion
obviously
its
a
man
game
these
days
and
there
is
every
chance
that
jonathan
will
be
making
an
impact
from
the
bench
wales
have
beaten
france
on
two
of
their
last
three
visits
to
paris
and
another
victory
this
time
around
would
keep
them
firmly
on
course
for
a
first
five
or
six
nations
title
triumph
since
graham
henry
former
wales
coach
said
a
couple
of
years
ago
that
we
should
be
bold
when
going
to
france
and
he
was
proved
right
said
ruddock
that
is
a
great
way
to
approach
the
game
and
something
we
will
further
endorse
with
the
players
this
week
