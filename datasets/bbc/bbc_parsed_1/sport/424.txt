final
andy
roddick
will
play
cyril
saulnier
in
the
final
of
the
sap
open
in
san
jose
on
sunday
the
american
top
seed
and
defending
champion
overcame
germanys
tommy
haas
the
third
seed
and
saulnier
survived
an
injury
scare
in
his
semifinal
with
seventhseeded
austrian
jurgen
melzer
the
frenchman
twisted
his
ankle
early
in
the
second
set
but
overcame
melzer
who
was
left
fuming
over
a
series
of
line
calls
i
was
feeling
horrible
earlier
in
the
week
roddick
said
i
thought
tonight
was
another
step
in
the
right
direction
on
my
returns
i
was
standing
in
more
and
im
getting
a
little
more
depth
even
if
i
dont
hit
a
perfect
return
roddick
won
the
last
four
points
of
the
firstset
tiebreak
before
being
broken
at
the
start
of
the
second
set
but
he
broke
straight
back
and
then
broke
haas
again
to
lead
its
extremely
frustrating
when
you
have
chances
against
a
topfive
player
and
dont
do
anything
with
them
admitted
haas
i
rushed
a
few
backhands
and
he
took
advantage
saulnier
will
move
into
the
worlds
top
for
the
first
time
after
his
passage
through
to
the
final
its
taken
a
lot
of
work
and
a
lot
of
fighting
in
my
mind
he
revealed
sometimes
i
didnt
believe
i
could
get
to
a
final
and
now
i
am
here
ive
stayed
mentally
strong
im
on
the
way
ill
keep
fighting
and
work
a
lot
and
ill
be
up
there
