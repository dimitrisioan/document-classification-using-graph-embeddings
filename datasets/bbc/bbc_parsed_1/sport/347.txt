questions
captaincy
brian
moore
believes
the
england
captain
should
not
be
a
fullback
jason
robinson
has
led
the
team
during
their
opening
three
defeats
in
the
six
nations
tournament
in
the
absence
of
flyhalf
jonny
wilkinson
the
world
champions
have
struggled
since
the
retirement
of
former
captain
martin
johnson
a
lock
forward
and
former
england
captain
moore
told
the
bbc
fullbacks
are
too
far
away
from
the
action
thats
not
a
reflection
on
robinson
personally
he
added
i
just
think
the
point
of
influence
needs
to
move
closer
to
the
pack
which
is
after
all
where
games
usually
start
and
finish
moore
says
a
lack
of
cohesion
in
the
forwards
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
england
have
lost
against
wales
france
and
ireland
in
this
years
tournament
assertiveness
in
the
pack
isnt
there
were
not
getting
enough
people
into
the
breakdowns
he
explained
were
not
getting
quick
ball
which
means
the
backs
are
being
stifled
their
creativity
depends
on
quick
ball
and
were
not
getting
that
with
injuries
depriving
him
of
key
players
like
wilkinson
coach
andy
robinson
has
given
youngsters
such
as
harry
ellis
and
jamie
noon
a
chance
and
moore
believes
the
last
two
games
against
italy
and
scotland
are
a
good
opportunity
to
experiment
further
the
problem
is
the
players
that
are
around
to
replace
the
icons
which
have
been
lost
because
of
retirement
and
injury
dont
have
the
requisite
experience
moore
added
you
cant
do
anything
about
that
but
play
them
there
are
players
who
have
been
knocking
on
the
door
its
time
for
them
to
be
looked
at
in
these
last
two
games
because
theres
nothing
on
them
we
then
go
into
next
season
with
a
greater
certainty
of
who
can
and
can
not
handle
the
pressure
of
international
rugby
