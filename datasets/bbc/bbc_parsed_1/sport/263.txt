mcleish
ready
for
criticism
rangers
manager
alex
mcleish
accepts
he
is
going
to
be
criticised
after
their
disastrous
uefa
cup
exit
at
the
hands
of
auxerre
at
ibrox
on
wednesday
mcleish
told
bbc
radio
five
live
we
were
in
pole
position
to
get
through
to
the
next
stage
but
we
blew
it
we
absolutely
blew
it
theres
no
use
burying
your
head
in
the
sand
we
know
we
are
going
to
get
a
lot
of
criticism
we
have
to
take
it
as
we
have
done
in
the
past
and
we
must
now
bounce
back
mcleish
admitted
his
teams
defending
was
amateurish
after
watching
them
lose
to
guy
rouxs
french
side
im
very
disappointed
because
we
didnt
give
ourselves
a
chance
losing
the
first
goal
from
our
own
corner
it
was
amateur
he
added
the
early
goal
in
the
second
half
gave
us
a
mountain
to
climb
and
we
never
created
the
same
kind
of
chances
as
we
did
in
the
first
half
its
difficult
to
take
positives
from
the
game
weve
let
the
fans
down
