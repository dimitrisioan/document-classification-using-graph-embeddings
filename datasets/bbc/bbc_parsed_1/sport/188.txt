campbell
lifts
lid
on
united
feud
arsenals
sol
campbell
has
called
the
rivalry
between
manchester
united
and
the
gunners
bitter
and
personal
past
encounters
have
stirred
up
plenty
of
illfeeling
between
the
sides
and
they
meet
again
at
highbury
on
tuesday
it
is
just
more
bitter
and
personal
against
united
the
defender
told
the
guardian
newspaper
theres
an
edge
after
all
that
has
happened
if
we
beat
them
it
will
be
one
of
our
sweetest
ever
wins
especially
because
of
how
we
lost
to
them
up
there
last
october
arsenal
lost
at
old
trafford
which
ended
a
record
match
unbeaten
league
run
and
sparked
a
minicrisis
with
the
gunners
winning
only
three
of
their
next
games
it
had
a
psychological
impact
on
us
but
again
because
of
the
way
we
were
defeated
added
the
yearold
referring
to
a
controversial
penalty
award
for
uniteds
first
goal
that
was
far
more
upsetting
losing
like
that
because
they
just
seem
to
get
away
with
it
you
try
and
balance
out
over
the
course
of
a
season
but
ive
had
so
many
rough
decisions
against
them
you
begin
to
wonder
with
tensions
spilling
over
afterwards
united
boss
sir
alex
ferguson
was
allegedly
pelted
with
pizza
in
the
players
tunnel
there
is
little
surprise
that
so
much
is
riding
on
the
return
encounter
on
everyone
at
arsenal
has
been
waiting
for
this
game
said
campbell
we
are
up
for
this
one
speaking
on
his
longterm
plans
campbell
signalled
his
intent
to
move
abroad
before
he
turns
im
now
and
in
five
years
time
i
wont
be
in
this
country
thats
definite
italy
looks
good
to
me
because
it
would
suit
my
kind
of
football
spain
is
an
option
but
the
idea
of
tasting
a
new
culture
and
learning
another
language
excites
me
the
most
im
starting
a
little
with
french
of
course
