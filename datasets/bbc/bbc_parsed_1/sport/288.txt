lewsey
puzzle
over
disallowed
try
englands
josh
lewsey
has
claimed
he
was
denied
a
late
try
in
his
sides
six
nations
loss
to
ireland
the
wasps
wing
insisted
he
grounded
the
ball
when
he
was
bundled
over
the
line
and
said
referee
jonathan
kaplan
had
made
a
wrong
decision
im
positive
i
touched
the
ball
down
over
the
line
lewsey
told
bbc
sport
it
certainly
wasnt
a
turnover
i
was
driven
over
and
i
put
the
ball
on
the
ground
the
whistle
went
and
i
let
go
of
the
ball
lewsey
added
one
of
the
irish
players
scooped
it
back
after
the
whistle
and
to
our
surprise
the
referee
then
gave
a
turnover
as
far
as
im
concerned
that
incident
and
mark
cuetos
effort
from
charlie
hodgsons
crossfield
kick
that
led
to
what
looked
like
a
good
try
were
the
two
key
elements
in
the
game
cueto
was
also
puzzled
as
to
why
his
try
had
been
disallowed
by
kaplan
i
dont
think
i
could
have
been
offside
for
without
a
doubt
i
was
behind
the
ball
said
the
sale
player
the
move
was
a
planned
technique
it
was
not
off
the
cuff
we
rehearse
it
time
and
time
again
i
wouldnt
say
we
were
robbed
some
decisions
go
with
you
and
some
go
against
you
today
they
went
against
us
and
thats
tough
at
international
level
