blackburn
over
savage
birmingham
have
confirmed
blackburn
made
a
bid
for
robbie
savage
but
managing
director
karen
brady
has
called
it
derisory
rovers
have
reportedly
offered
â£
up
front
for
the
wales
star
with
the
fee
rising
to
â£m
but
brady
told
the
sun
the
bid
was
a
waste
of
fax
paper
and
my
time
she
added
the
way
things
are
going
all
this
could
affect
the
relationship
between
the
clubs
theyve
got
into
robbies
head
but
hes
not
for
sale
savages
future
at
birmingham
has
been
the
source
of
speculation
for
several
weeks
with
some
fans
criticising
his
performances
for
the
club
earlier
in
the
season
however
good
displays
against
west
brom
and
aston
villa
have
impressed
blues
fans
the
crowd
gave
me
a
massive
standing
ovation
when
i
came
off
on
saturday
which
was
nice
he
said
it
was
fantastic
even
though
i
was
criticised
by
a
number
of
them
in
recent
weeks
and
on
saturday
it
showed
how
much
i
mean
to
them
its
not
for
me
to
say
about
transfer
rumours
its
between
the
two
clubs
i
havent
created
the
speculation
myself
i
havent
phoned
every
national
newspaper
saying
blackburn
are
trying
to
buy
me
its
not
up
to
me
birmingham
manager
steve
bruce
insists
he
does
not
want
to
sell
savage
a
lot
is
said
and
written
about
sav
but
he
has
been
terrific
for
birmingham
city
the
last
two
and
a
half
years
he
said
the
fans
love
him
because
he
epitomises
them
he
works
hard
they
like
people
like
that
and
there
are
not
many
like
him
and
why
the
hell
should
i
sell
him
to
someone
else
i
am
not
interested
