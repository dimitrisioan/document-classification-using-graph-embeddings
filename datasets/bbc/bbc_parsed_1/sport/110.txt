treated

after
he
fractured
his
foot
at
the
start

could
be
fit
for
the
vital
stamford

i
hope
he
can
be

and
i
will
try
to
help
him
make
that
happen

put
everything
right
with
arjens
foot
the
last
time
i
saw
him
days
ago
it
was
an
obvious
correction
and
easy
to
perform
i
know
he
was
pleased
with
what
i
did
and
now
that
he
is
running
