fears

scottish
rugby
former
scotland
international
finlay
calder
fears
civil
war
at
the
sru
could
seriously
hamper
his
countrys
rbs
six
nations
campaign
four
members
of
the
executive
board
including
the
chairman
david
mackay
have
resigned
after
a
simmering
row
and
calder
said
this
is
terrible
news
for
every
level
of
scottish
rugby
david
is
a
successful
businessman
and
i
thought
that
if
anybody
could
transform
the
negative
atmosphere
and
rising
debt
level
it
was
him
mackays
executive
board
has
been
in
a
power
struggle
with
the
general
committee
which
contains
members
elected
by
scotlands
club
sides
he
has
been
driven
out
by
people
who
seem
happier
waging
civil
war
than
addressing
the
central
issue
that
professional
rugby
cant
be
run
by
amateurs
said
calder
in
fact
i
dont
understand
why
we
are
still
having
this
argument
years
after
professionalism
arrived
but
i
dont
believe
the
rest
of
the
sru
will
take
this
lying
down
i
think
the
banks
will
be
dismayed
at
this
decision
and
ultimately
it
is
them
who
pull
the
strings
so
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
they
reviewed
their
position
but
in
the
wider
picture
what
message
does
this
send
out
he
thought
the
work
of
scotlands
coaches
who
have
been
attempting
to
arrest
the
decline
of
the
national
side
would
be
made
much
more
difficult
matt
williams
and
willie
anderson
must
be
wondering
what
have
we
walked
into
here
said
calder
and
we
can
now
expect
weeks
of
arguments
and
acrimony
just
at
a
time
when
we
should
be
looking
forward
to
the
six
nations
championship
i
am
very
very
disappointed
more
than
you
can
imagine
why
do
so
many
scots
have
this
knack
of
turning
on
each
other
when
the
going
gets
tough
