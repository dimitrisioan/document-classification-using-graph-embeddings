tama
umaga
has
warned
the
british
and
irish
lions

be
his
most
fearsome
opponents
yet
ahead
of
their
summer
tour
but
umaga
in
england

saturdays
irb
rugby
aid
match
also
backed
new
zealand
to
win
the
threetest
series
against
the
lions
he
told
bbc
sport
its
potentially
the
most
fearsome
lineup
ive
ever

up
against
theyre
awesome
but
id
back
us
all
the
way
to
beat
them
when
they
come
over
lions
boss
sir
clive
woodward
is
set
to
announce
his
squad
for
the
junejuly
tour
next
month
when
woodward
was
appointed
last
year
it
was
widely
believed
he
would
rely
heavily
on
his
former
england
players
but
umaga
said
hed
be
hard
pushed
to
do
that
now
considering
the
shape
of
the
six
nations
dont
get
me
wrong
england
have
got
a
lot
of
talented
guys
and
im
sure
there
are
some
of
them
wholl
make
the
lions
test
xv
but
you
cant
disguise
wales
and
ireland
in
particular
some
of
the
tries
theyve
scored
have
been
great
ill
admit
itll
be
fairly
awesome
lining
up
against
the
likes
of
brian
odriscoll
umaga
will
meet
odriscoll
in
saturdays
rugby
aid
match
at
twickenham
with
the
irish
captain
leading
the
northern
hemisphere
side
odriscoll
is
among
a
host
of
players
in
the
northern
hemisphere
squad
coached
by
woodward
that
are
tipped
for
lions
callups
itll
be
good
for
us
to
get
an
early
idea
of
some
of
these
guys
although
a
lot
can
change
between
now
and
june
umaga
said
the
yearold
admitted
interest
in
the
lions
tour
was
immense
calling
it
the
biggest
thing
to
hit
new
zealand
since
lord
of
the
rings
he
added
as
players
its
enough
for
us
to
be
driven
by
the
rarity
of
playing
the
lions
in
fact
its
not
just
us
all
blacks
its
the
talk
of
the
country
umaga
admitted
the
fear
of
injury
weighed
on
his
mind
ahead
of
saturdays
charity
game
which
features
a
host
of
big
names
including
george
gregan
andrew
mehrtens
and
chris
latham
but
he
admitted
the
value
of
the
cause
proceeds
of
the
match
will
go
to
aiding
victims
of
the
tsunami
easily
won
him
over
the
second
southern
hemisphere
coach
rod
macqueen
made
the
approach
i
didnt
hesitate
it
was
great
when
new
zealand
rugby
then
gave
me
the
all
clear
thankfully
i
didnt
know
anyone
that
was
involved
in
the
tragedy
of
the
tsunami
but
you
couldnt
miss
all
the
horrific
reports
on
the
news
there
are
so
many
people
that
were
affected
are
still
affected
and
will
be
affected
for
a
long
time
its
just
good
to
know
we
can
do
something
minor
to
help
out
the
match
will
be
televised
on
bbc
one
at
gmt
on
saturday
