in
two
of
their
three
meetings

executed
it
perfectly
he
said
its
always
tough
to
come
out
to
play
andre
i
didnt
want
him
to
play
his
game
he
makes
you
run
like

all
over
the
court
and
agassi
who
was
more
than
matched
for
power
by
his
opponents

melzer
was
an
example
of
several
players
on

willing

their
chances
