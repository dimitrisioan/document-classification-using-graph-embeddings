hail
italians
ireland
coach
eddie
osullivan
heaped
praise
on
italy
after
seeing
his
side
stutter
to
a
victory
in
rome
it
was
a
hell
of
a
tough
game
said
osullivan
we
struggled
in
the
first
half
because
we
hadnt
the
football
italy
played
really
well
they
handled
the
ball
well
in
terms
of
kicking
it
if
thats
not
an
oxymoron
we
said
before
the
game
that
it
might
take
until
minutes
from
the
end
for
this
game
to
be
won
and
thats
how
it
turned
out
ireland
struggled
to
cope
with
italys
fierce
start
and
were
indebted
to
skipper
brian
odriscoll
who
set
up
tries
for
geordan
murphy
and
peter
stringer
we
had
our
first
attack
in
the
italian
half
after
minutes
said
osullivan
we
had
a
good
return
with
three
firsthalf
possessions
in
their
half
and
we
scored
twice
the
second
half
was
about
spending
more
time
in
their
half
scrumhalf
peter
stringer
was
also
glad
that
ireland
escaped
wtih
a
victory
all
credit
to
them
he
told
bbc
sport
we
knew
it
would
be
tough
coming
to
rome
they
always
give
us
a
tough
game
here
and
they
showed
a
lot
of
spirit
they
had
a
lot
of
ball
in
the
first
half
but
we
got
a
few
scores
when
we
got
into
their
