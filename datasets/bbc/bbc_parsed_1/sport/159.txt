mourinho
defiant
on
chelsea
form
chelsea
boss
jose
mourinho
has
insisted
that
sir
alex
ferguson
and
arsene
wenger
would
swap
places
with
him
mourinhos
side
were
knocked
out
of
the
fa
cup
by
newcastle
last
sunday
before
seeing
barcelona
secure
a
champions
league
firstleg
lead
in
the
nou
camp
but
he
denied
his
club
was
suffering
a
dip
in
form
which
league
rivals
arsenal
and
manchester
united
could
exploit
they
can
not
speak
to
us
about
blips
because
theyre
not
in
a
better
position
than
us
mourinho
said
do
they
want
to
change
positions
with
us
we
are
top
of
the
league
by
nine
points
and
in
the
carling
cup
final
the
only
thing
they
can
say
they
are
in
a
better
position
than
us
in
is
the
fa
cup
in
the
champions
league
all
three
teams
can
either
go
through
or
go
out
but
the
one
team
that
is
in
the
best
position
is
still
chelsea
mourinho
said
it
was
important
to
keep
his
teams
results
in
perspective
dont
try
to
put
pressure
on
me
because
i
am
never
under
pressure
he
warned
we
have
lost
one
important
game
this
week
at
newcastle
and
were
out
of
the
fa
cup
but
i
dont
think
a
defeat
in
a
firstleg
tie
is
a
real
defeat
we
are
just
down
at
halftime
asked
if
his
chelsea
honeymoon
was
now
over
mourinho
replied
i
have
had
years
of
honeymoons
with
my
wife
the
day
that
this
club
is
not
happy
with
me
is
the
day
that
i
go
