dallaglio
eyeing
lions
tour
place
former
england
captain
lawrence
dallaglio
still
harbours
hopes
of
a
place
on
the
british
and
irish
lions
tour
to
new
zealand
lions
coach
sir
clive
woodward
has
made
it
clear
he
will
pick
his
squad
to
tour
next
summer
based
on
form
shown
in
the
six
nations
championship
but
dallaglio
who
called
time
on
england
earlier
this
year
said
i
assure
you
i
wouldnt
let
anyone
down
i
know
what
it
takes
and
what
i
have
to
offer
he
told
the
daily
telegraph
dallaglio
toured
south
africa
with
the
lions
in
but
was
forced
home
early
with
a
knee
injury
from
the
trip
to
australia
three
years
ago
the
yearold
also
felt
concentrating
on
club
rugby
could
have
prolonged
his
international
shelflife
he
said
ill
be
in
good
shape
and
fresh
without
another
tests
on
the
clock
from
what
i
witnessed
at
close
quarters
on
sunday
in
our
heineken
cup
match
against
leicester
i
certainly
didnt
feel
out
of
place
alongside
those
players
many
of
whom
will
be
on
the
trip
if
im
fit
and
playing
well
then
im
most
certainly
available
if
clive
feels
he
has
no
need
to
look
outside
the
international
crop
then
fine
if
he
does
then
he
wont
need
to
look
too
far
will
he
