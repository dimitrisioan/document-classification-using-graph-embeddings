charvis
set
to
lose
fitness
bid
flanker
colin
charvis
is
unlikely
to
play
any
part
in
wales
final
two
games
of
the
six
nations
charvis
has
missed
all
three
of
wales
victories
with
an
ankle
injury
and
his
recovery
has
been
slower
than
expected
he
will
not
figure
in
the
scotland
game
and
is
now
thought
unlikely
to
be
ready
for
the
final
game
said
wales
physio
mark
davies
sonny
parker
is
continuing
to
struggle
with
a
neck
injury
but
hal
luscombe
should
be
fit
for
the
murrayfield
trip
centre
parker
has
only
a
slim
chance
of
being
involved
against
the
scots
on
march
so
luscombes
return
to
fitness
after
missing
the
france
match
with
hamstring
trouble
is
a
timely
boost
said
wales
assistant
coach
scott
johnson
were
positive
about
hal
and
hope
hell
be
raring
to
go
he
comes
back
into
the
mix
again
adds
to
the
depth
and
gives
us
other
options
replacement
hooker
robin
mcbryde
remains
a
doubt
after
picking
up
knee
ligament
damage
in
paris
last
saturday
were
getting
that
reviewed
and
we
should
know
more
by
the
end
of
the
week
how
robins
looking
added
johnson
were
hopeful
but
its
too
early
to
say
at
this
stage
steve
jones
from
the
dragons
is
likely
to
be
drafted
in
if
mcbryde
fails
to
recover
