at

is
uncertain
after
he
and
assistant
mark
aizlewood
refused
a
severance
package
chester
have
won
only
two
of
their
last
league
games
but
chairman
steve
vaughan
claims
he
can
not
afford
to
sack
the
yearold
liverpool
legend
vaughan
said
i
offered
a
financial
settlement
so
they
could
resign
with
dignity
but
an
obvious
action
is
to
dismiss
them
i
havent
because
of
the
finances
so
technically
theyre
still
employees
vaughan
claimed
that
aizlewood
had
verbally
agreed
to
the
offer
but
the
chester
chairman
added
after
they
discussed
the
offer
with
their
solicitor
who
also
acts
as
their
agent
they
decided
to
withdraw
the
verbal
agreement
which
was
disappointing

appointed
at
the
end
of
august
following
the
departure
of
former
liverpool
teammate
mark
wright
who
guided
chester
to
the
conference
title
last
season

bottom
of

when

took
over
but
the
former
liverpool

enjoyed
an
impressive
start
to
managerial
life
taking
the
club
into
the
third
round
of
the
fa
cup
and
winning
the
managerofthemonth
award
for

hovering
just
above
the
league
