penalty
in
heartss
defeat
at
tynecastle
he
was
sent
off
for
violent
conduct
in
the
th
minute
but
we
dont
know
if
he
did
something
else
after
the
whistle
we
dont
know
how
many
red
cards
he
was
shown
said
an
sfa
statement
hearts
could
also
face
action
after
three
fans
were
arrested
for
throwing
coins
on
the
pitch
rangers
striker
dad
prso
was
also
sent
off
during
the
same
incident
when
he
received
a
second
yellow
card
for
wrestling
the
ball
away
from
craig
gordon
and
leaving
the
hearts
keeper
on
the
ground
the
sfa
said
once
the
referees
report
comes
in
then
well
immediately
look
at
things
we
dont
normally
get
the
reports
until
a
couple
of
days
after
the
game
but
were
well
aware
of
what
happened
here
prso
was
sent
off
for
two
cautions
and
that
will
just
be
a
onematch
suspension
the
sfa
is
certain
to
come
down
hard
on
mikoliunas
after
southamptons
david
prutton
was
banned
for
games
on
wednesday
by
the
english
fa
for
shoving
referee
alan
wiley
hearts
boss
john
robertson
said
mikoliunas
has
thrown
his
chest
against
the
assistant
referees
chest
and
got
a
red
card
for
it
the
officials
have
got
to
take
into
account
the
fact
hes
a
young
lad
but
people
have
got
to
take
into
account
why
he
was
incensed
why
were
hearts
fans
incensed
why
did
nobody
from
the
rangers
bench
claim
for
a
penalty
kick
rangers
boss
alex
mcleish
accepted
referee
dallas
had
no
option
but
to
send
prso
off
mcleish
said
im
glad
to
see
the
spirit
of
the
players
fighting
to
the
very
end
literally
with
dado
trying
to
get
the
ball
back
from
craig
gordon
but
it
was
overzealousness
and
i
dont
think
hugh
had
any
option
