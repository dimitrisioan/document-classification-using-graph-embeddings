turning
down
a
move
to

irish
league
midfielder
was
also
being

is
on
his
way
from
inver
park
i
heard
on
sunday
that
he
has
joined
sunderland

not
from
the
lad
himself
he
said
robbie
has
an
agreement
with

personally
i
would
rather
see
him
making

his
physique
before
moving
into
the
fulltime
game
he
has
been
