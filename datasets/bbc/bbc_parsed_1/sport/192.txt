birmingham
manager
steve
bruce
admitted
their
trip

toughest
draw
possible
bruce
said
im
still
in
shock
weve
given
good
accounts
of
ourselves
against
chelsea
in
the
past
and
played
well
when
we
lost
at
home
at
the
start
of
the
season
but
thats
the
past
but
its
the
best
competition
in
the
world
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
we
will
give
it
our
best
shot
brentford
boss
martin
allen
remained
cautious
despite
his
sides
favourable
draw
a
home
tie
with
either
hartlepool
or
boston
the
best
thing
is
its
a
home
game
however
we
know
that
whoever
we
play
it
is
going
to
be
a
really
tough
game
said
allen
but
its
not
about
the
opposition
its
about
us
we
all
want
to
get
through
to
the
next
round
and
face
a
massive
team

the
way
it
