are
set
to

matt
dawson
a
new
deal
the
yearold
world
cup
winning
scrumhalf
has
impressed
since
joining
the
london
side
from
northampton
this
summer
on
a
oneyear
contract
wasps
coach
warren
gatland
told
the
daily
mirror
we
have
not
yet
offered
matt
a
new
contract
but
we
will
be
doing
so
im
very
happy
with
his
contribution
and
i
think
hes
good
enough
to
play
for
another
couple
of
years
dawson
played
a
vital
part
in
englands
world
cup
win
last
year
but
has
fallen
out
of
favour
with
new
coach
andy
robinson
after
missing
a
training
session
in
september
however
he
hopes
the
new
deal
will
help
him
regain
his
england
place
rugby
is
still
my
priority
and
theres
still
a
burning
desire
within
me
to
play
the
best
rugby
i
possibly
can
he
said
i
know
within
myself
if
i
was
given
the
chance
i
could
play
for
england
again
i
know
im
fit
enough
im
strong
enough
im
skilful
enough
