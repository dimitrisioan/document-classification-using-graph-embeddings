wenger
says
he
has
no
plans
to
sign
a
new
goalkeeper
during
the
january
transfer
window
wenger
has
brought
in
manuel
almunia
for
the
last
three
games
for
the
outofform
jens
lehmann
but
the
spaniard
himself
has
been
prone
to
mistakes
there
have
been
suggestions
that
wenger
will
swoop
for
a
highquality
shotstopper
in
the
new
year
but
he
told
the
evening
standard
i
dont
feel
it
will
be
necessary
to
bring
in
a
new
goalkeeper
in
january
the
gunners
manager
refused
to
comment
on
the
difficult
start
that
yearold
almunia
has
made
to
his
career
at
highbury
and
he
would
not
be
drawn
on
whether
lehmann
would
return
for
the
topofthe

clash
with
chelsea
on
sunday
almunia
was
at
fault
for
rosenborgs
goal
in
arsenals
champions
league
win
on
tuesday
and
had
some
hairy
moments
in
last
weeks
win
over
birmingham
but
wenger
said
earlier
this
week
that
his
indifferent
form
was
down
to
pressure
caused
by
being
under
scrutiny
from
the
media
the
debate
has
gone
on
too
long
everyone
has
an
opinion
and
i
do
not
have
to
add
to
it
wenger
added
arsenal
have
been
linked
with
middlesbrough
keeper
mark
schwarzer
