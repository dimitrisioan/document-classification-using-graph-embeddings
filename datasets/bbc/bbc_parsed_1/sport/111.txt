chelsea
leftback
wayne
bridge
could
miss
the
rest
of
the
season
with
a
suspected
broken
ankle
the
england
international
was
hurt
in
an
innocuous
challenge
with
alan
shearer
during
the
londoners
fa
cup
defeat
at
newcastle
on
sunday
we
think
its
a
big
injury
said
jose
mourinho
whose
chelsea
team
this
week
meet
barcelona
in
the
champions
league
and
liverpool
in
the
carling
cup
final
william
gallas
and
damien
duff
could
also
miss
the
barcelona
game
france
defender
gallas
and
ireland
winger
duff
both
picked
up
their
injuries
in
the
closing
stages
of
chelseas
defeat
at
st
james
park
with
bridge
having
gone
off
after
mourinho
used
all
three
substitutes
those
knocks
plus
carlo
cudicinis
red
card
meant
chelsea
finished
the
game
with
seven
ablebodied
players
cudicini
would
not
have
played
against
barcelona
but
had
been
promised
a
game
in
the
carling
cup
final
although
he
will
now
miss
the
cardiff
showpiece
through
suspension
the
manager
is
not
planning
to
add
any
new
names
to
his
squad
ahead
of
the
trip
to
barcelona
even
though
he
has
few
options
to
replace
bridge
at
leftback
celestine
babayaro
left
the
club
in
january
ironically
to
join
newcastle
and
although
gallas
has
deputised
at
leftback
before
he
is
struggling
to
be
fit
himself
it
could
be
that
paulo
ferreira
usually
a
rightback
is
switched
to
leftback
with
glen
johnson
who
ended
the
newcastle
game
in
goal
playing
on
the
right
youngsters
ben
hudell
joe
keenan
and
sam
tillen
would
be
options
should
mourinho
decide
to
call
up
a
replacement
but
it
is
unlikely
he
would
risk
an
untried
prospect
in
a
champions
league
tie
bridges
injury
also
means
mourinho
who
reportedly
wants
to
sign
ashley
cole
from
arsenal
will
not
have
a
specialist
senior
leftback
for
the
runin
to
the
season
he
bridge
has
no
chance
of
playing
against
barcelona
probably
will
not
play
against
liverpool
in
the
carling
cup
final
and
maybe
not
for
the
rest
of
the
season
he
said
the
medical
department
will
try
to
do
everything
to
recover
gallas
and
duff
we
will
have
to
wait
and
see
but
i
wont
cry
about
injuries
because
we
will
have
players
to
play
on
tuesday
shearer
said
he
was
unsure
what
caused
bridges
injury
i
dont
know
what
happened
he
said
it
was
just
a
shame
i
dont
think
we
even
touched
each
other
by
all
accounts
its
pretty
serious
i
went
into
the
dressingroom
after
the
game
and
wished
him
all
the
best
mourinho
whose
team
are
chasing
three
trophies
has
already
lost
winger
arjen
robben
to
a
serious
injury
