comments

fine
of
about
â£
the
federation
had
initially
declined
to
take
action
against
aragones
after
comments
he
made
during
a
national
team
training
session
in
october
but
its
president
angel
maria
villar
changed
his
mind
after
a
request
by
spains
antiviolence
commission
aragones
insisted
the
comments
made
to
henrys
arsenal
clubmate
jose
antonio
reyes
were
meant
to
motivate
the
player
and
were
not
intended
to
be
offensive
i
never
intended
to
offend
anyone
and
for
that
reason
i
have
a
very
easy
conscience
he
said
at
the
time
im
obliged
to
motivate
my
players
to
get
the
best
results
as
part
of
that
job
i
use
colloquial
language
with
which
we
can
all
understand
each
other
within
the
framework
of
the
football
world
englands
players
made
a
point
of
wearing
antiracism
tshirts
when
training
before
their
friendly
against
spain
in
madrid
last
month
but
the
storm
increased
following
racist
chanting
by
spanish
fans
at
englands
black
players
during
the
game
which
spain
won
spains
minister
of
sport
jaime
lissavetzky
was
quick
to
give
his
backing
to
the
federations
decision
everyone
who
has
a
public
function
has
to
consider
their
declarations
and
make
sure
they
do
not
give
a
negative
image
he
said
we
are
going
to
have
zero
tolerance
in
questions
of
racism
