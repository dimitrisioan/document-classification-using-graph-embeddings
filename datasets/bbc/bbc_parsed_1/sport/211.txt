blasts
arsenal
arsenals
brazilian
midfielder
edu
has
hit
out
at
the
club
for
stalling
over
offering
him
a
new
contract
edus
deal
expires
next
summer
and
he
has
been
linked
with
spanish
trio
real
madrid
barcelona
and
valencia
he
told
bbc
sport
im
not
sure
if
i
want
to
stay
or
not
because
the
club
have
let
the
situation
go
on
this
far
if
they
had
really
wanted
to
sign
they
should
have
come
up
with
an
offer
six
months
before
indicating
they
wanted
to
sign
me
and
thats
made
me
think
edus
brother
and
representative
amadeo
fensao
has
previously
said
that
arsenals
current
offer
to
the
midfielder
was
well
short
of
what
he
was
seeking
and
edu
added
my
brother
is
due
to
come
to
london
on
thursday
there
is
a
meeting
planned
for
or
january
to
sort
it
out
with
arsenal
now
i
have
a
choice
to
stay
or
go
i
want
to
sort
it
out
as
soon
as
possible
thats
in
the
best
interests
of
both
the
club
and
myself
im
going
to
make
my
decision
after
the
meeting
later
this
week
edu
is
now
able
to
begin
negotiations
with
other
clubs
because
fifa
regulations
allow
players
to
start
talks
six
months
before
their
contracts
expire
the
midfielder
who
broke
in
to
the
brazilian
national
side
in
admitted
he
had
been
flattered
to
have
been
linked
with
the
three
spanish
giants
edu
said
ive
just
heard
stories
from
the
news
that
the
madrid
president
florentino
perez
the
valencia
people
as
well
as
barcelona
are
interested
thats
nice
but
ive
never
talked
to
them
so
i
cant
say
they
want
me
sign
last
month
wenger
said
he
we
was
hopeful
edu
would
sign
a
new
deal
and
played
down
suggestions
that
the
lure
of
a
club
like
real
madrid
would
be
too
strong
for
edu
edu
added
that
he
had
been
encouraged
by
wengers
support
for
him
i
still
have
a
good
relationship
with
arsene
wenger
hes
always
said
he
wants
me
to
sign
