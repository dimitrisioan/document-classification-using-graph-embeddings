oconnell
rejects
lions
rumours
ireland
and
munster
lock
paul
oconnell
has
dismissed
media
reports
linking
him
to
the
captaincy
of
the
lions
tour
to
new
zealand
this
summer
oconnell
is
rumoured
to
be
among
the
frontrunners
for
the
job
but
says
he
is
totally
focused
on
sundays
six
nations
crunch
clash
with
england
i
honestly
dont
think
about
these
reports
he
told
bbc
sport
the
lions
thing
is
all
speculation
and
newspaper
talk
nothing
more
i
just
ignore
it
and
get
on
with
my
job
he
added
the
only
thing
that
annoys
me
after
reading
some
reports
is
what
the
opposition
locks
think
i
can
just
imagine
them
saying
im
going
to
show
this
guy
whats
what
about
second
row
play
thats
the
one
thing
that
makes
me
cringe
oconnell
who
made
a
tryscoring
international
debut
against
wales
two
years
ago
is
enjoying
his
meteoric
rise
into
rugbys
shop
window
but
refuses
to
be
drawn
on
the
lions
i
have
spoken
to
sir
clive
woodward
a
few
times
but
not
for
very
long
certainly
nothing
about
summer
holidays
he
joked
he
also
said
he
remains
wary
of
wounded
englands
abilities
coming
into
sundays
game
after
two
straight
defeats
dismissing
predictions
of
a
certain
irish
victory
its
very
dangerous
to
think
that
this
england
team
has
so
much
experience
and
skill
you
do
not
become
a
bad
team
overnight
they
have
two
world
class
gamebreakers
in
josh
lewsey
and
jason
robinson
while
charlie
hodgson
is
just
ready
to
click
into
place
he
insisted
ireland
will
not
make
the
mistake
of
being
overconfident
thats
not
going
to
happen
in
our
squad
no
ireland
team
lining
up
to
play
england
will
ever
fall
into
that
trap
he
said
every
time
we
play
england
we
know
what
a
big
task
it
is
look
at
what
they
did
to
us
two
years
ago
i
remember
that
game
all
too
well
and
it
was
not
a
good
feeling
i
came
on
as
a
replacement
and
we
were
losing
and
ended
up
getting
hammered
so
i
know
what
can
happen
when
england
come
to
dublin
they
could
so
easily
have
been
coming
to
dublin
with
two
wins
and
staring
a
grand
slam
in
the
face
as
well
