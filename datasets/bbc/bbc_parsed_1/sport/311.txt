fortnight
scotland
will
try
to
give
their
coach
matt
williams
a
first
six
nations
victory
when
italy
come
to
edinburgh
but
they
again
struggled
to
turn
pressure
into
points
the
home
side
started
with
tremendous
intensity
and
dominated
territory
and
possession
in
the
opening
minutes
a
powerful
charge
from
flanker
jason
white
was
carried
on
by
ali
hogg
and
when
ireland
conceded
a
penalty
close
to
their
own
line
scotland
kicked
it
to
touch
the
irish
defence
foiled
the
home
side
on
that
occasion
but
a
stray
hand
in
a
ruck
allowed
paterson
to
stroke
over
a
penalty
in
the
eighth
minute
if
that
was
a
paltry
reward
for
their
early
pressure
scotland
got
the
try
they
deserved
when
patersons
searing
break
and
andy
craigs
pass
sent
southwell
streaking
to
the
right
corner
paterson
was
off
target
with
the
conversion
and
flyhalf
dan
parks
then
missed
a
presentable
dropgoal
attempt
ireland
got
themselves
on
the
scoreboard
with
an
ogara
penalty
and
by
the
th
minute
the
visitors
were
ahead
stuart
grimes
pulled
down
okelly
at
a
lineout
ireland
kicked
the
penalty
to
touch
and
from
the
setpiece
the
big
lock
was
driven
over
by
the
rest
of
his
pack
ogara
added
the
conversion
and
a
further
penalty
after
shane
horgan
almost
grabbed
a
second
try
from
ogaras
chip
to
the
corner
only
for
the
ball
to
spill
from
his
hand
but
ireland
still
delivered
a
hammer
blow
to
scotlands
hopes
just
before
the
interval
oconnell
skipper
in
the
absence
of
brian
odriscoll
powered
through
parks
weak
tackle
after
a
freekick
from
a
scrummage
to
burrow
over
scotland
suffered
a
further
blow
on
the
resumption
when
ireland
flanker
johnny
oconnor
won
another
vital
turnover
and
ogaras
basketball
pass
sent
hickie
over
in
the
left
corner
ogara
converted
and
then
thumped
over
a
m
penalty
to
give
the
visitors
a
commanding
advantage
scotland
looked
bereft
of
ideas
but
a
halfbreak
from
paterson
sparked
them
back
to
life
just
before
the
hour
stuart
grimes
won
a
lineout
and
a
wellworked
move
saw
petrie
scuttle
round
the
side
of
the
ruck
to
dive
over
in
the
left
corner
but
it
proved
a
false
dawn
and
ireland
reasserted
their
authority
in
the
final
minutes
peter
stringer
and
okelly
combined
to
put
giant
prop
hayes
over
in
the
right
corner
before
replacement
gavin
duffy
scorched
away
on
the
left
david
humphreys

the
