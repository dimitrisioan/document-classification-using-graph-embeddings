williams
though
blamed
her

on
injuries
blisters
were
a
factor
but
mostly
my
stomach
wasnt
that
great
she
said
i
did
it
in
the
last
tournament
in
the
semifinals
and
i
was
serving
at
in
the
final
the
first
time
i
served
again
was
sunday
and
there
wasnt
a
lot
i
could
do
out
there
when
your
serve
isnt
good
it
throws
the
rest
of
your
game
off
too
she
will
wait
to
see
how
she
recovers
before
