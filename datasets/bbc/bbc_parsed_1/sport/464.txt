take
a
bunch

the
best
said
connors
speaking
at
queens
club
in
london
what
impressed
me
most
was
not
only
the
coaches
but
the
way
the
kids
went
about
their
workouts
and
the
feeling
they
put
into
every
practice
they
had
it
was
interesting
to
me
to
see
kids
of
with
that
desire
and
passion
and
that
can
only
be
brought
about
by
the
coaches
surrounding
them
instilling
the
importance
of
work
and
practice
is
something
you
cant
buy
they
know
whats
been
given
to
them
and
all
they
have
to
do
is
give
back
the
effort
and
every
minute
of
practice
they
were
doing
that
speaking
from
la
manga
lta
performance
director
david
felgate
told
bbc
sport
jimmy
was
fantastic
with
the
players
and
the
coaches
and
very
humble
considering
what
hes
achieved
he
worked
through
the
coaches
and
hopefully
it
will
grow
and
hell
get
to
have
more
of
an
individual
relationship
with
some
of
the
players
and
get
to
know
them
he
made
it
clear
from
the
word
go
he
didnt
want
it
to
be
shortterm
this
is
a
weekayear
job
for
me
its
my
life
and
my
passion
and
its
the
same
with
the
coaches
he
respects
that
but
he
wants
to
be
involved
and
have
real
input
and
why
would
he
stake
his
reputation
on
something
thats
not
going
to
be
successful
connors
has
also
agreed
to
commentate
for
the
bbc
at
next
years
wimbledon
championships
he
will
work
during
the
second
week
of
the
tournament
