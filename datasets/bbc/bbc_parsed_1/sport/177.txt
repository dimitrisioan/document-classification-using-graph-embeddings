thompson
says
gerrard
should
stay
liverpool
legend
phil
thompson
has
pleaded
with
steve
gerrard
to
reject
any
overtures
from
chelsea
the
exreds
assistant
boss
also
warned
that
any
honours
won
at
chelsea
would
be
cheapened
by
the
bid
to
buy
success
he
told
bbc
radio
five
live
liverpool
would
think
about
any
bid
made
but
it
will
all
be
down
to
steve
in
the
end
but
it
wouldnt
have
that
same
sweet
feeling
at
chelsea
where
its
all
moneyorientated
and
about
simply
buying
the
best
thompson
reacted
sharply
to
some
liverpool
supporters
who
criticised
gerrards
performance
in
the
carling
cup
final
against
chelsea
a
number
of
fans
questioned
gerrards
commitment
and
sarcastically
branded
his
own
goal
in
liverpools
defeat
as
his
first
goal
for
chelsea
thompson
added
i
heard
those
comments
from
socalled
supporters
and
they
were
diabolical
absolutely
outrageous
stevie
carried
the
club
last
year
and
this
year
hes
always
put
liverpool
first
thompson
who
savoured
seven
titlewinning
seasons
and
two
european
cup
triumphs
during
his
anfield
playing
career
is
confident
that
the
lure
of
champions
league
football
will
keep
gerrard
at
anfield
i
hope
champions
league
football
will
beckon
for
liverpool
either
as
winners
or
as
finishing
fourth
in
the
premiership
and
he
will
commit
himself
there
has
been
a
lot
of
soulsearching
the
way
things
have
gone
lately
i
hope
hes
hardening
to
the
fact
he
will
have
big
decisions
to
make
but
i
hope
it
is
to
the
benefit
of
steven
gerrard
and
i
hope
it
is
worthwhile
for
liverpool
