williams
rejects
criticism
serena
williams
has
angrily
rejected
claims
that
she
and
sister
venus
are
a
declining
force
in
tennis
the
sisters
ended
last
year
without
a
grand
slam
title
for
the
first
time
since
but
serena
denied
their
challenge
was
fading
saying
thats
not
fair
im
tired
of
not
saying
anything
weve
been
practising
hard
weve
had
serious
injuries
ive
had
surgery
and
after
i
got
to
the
wimbledon
final
i
dont
know
many
who
have
done
that
while
serena
is
through
to
the
australian
open
semifinals
venus
went
out
in
the
fourth
round
meaning
she
has
not
gone
further
than
the
last
eight
in
her
last
five
grand
slam
appearances
but
serena
added
venus
had
a
severe
strain
in
her
stomach
i
actually
had
the
same
injury
but
i
didnt
tear
it
the
way
she
did
if
i
would
have
torn
it
i
wouldnt
have
been
here
she
played
a
player
alicia
molik
that
just
played
out
of
her
mind
and
venus
made
some
errors
that
she
probably
shouldnt
have
made
serena
also
said
people
tended
to
forget
the
impact
the
murder
of
sister
yetunde
price
had
had
on
the
family
to
top
it
off
we
have
a
very
very
very
very
very
close
family
serena
continued
to
be
in
some
situation
that
weve
been
placed
in
in
the
past
little
over
a
year
its
not
easy
to
come
out
and
just
perform
at
your
best
when
you
realize
there
are
so
many
things
that
are
so
important
so
no
were
not
declining
were
here
i
dont
have
to
win
this
tournament
to
prove
anything
i
know
that
im
out
here
and
i
know
that
im
one
of
the
best
players
out
here
