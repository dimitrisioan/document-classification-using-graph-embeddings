henson
stakes
early
lions
claim
the
six
nations
may
be
a
glittering
prize
in
itself
but
every
player
from
the
four
home
unions
will
also
have
one
eye
on
a
possible
trip
to
new
zealand
with
the
lions
this
summer
the
player
who
staked
the
biggest
claim
for
a
place
in
the
starting
xv
over
the
weekend
was
gavin
henson
hes
very
confident
you
just
had
to
listen
to
his
interview
afterwards
he
beamed
with
confidence
but
although
theres
an
element
of
arrogance
its
good
arrogance
he
certainly
showed
some
nice
touches
he
once
showed
a
clean
pair
of
heels
to
mathew
tait
when
he
got
outside
him
his
defence
was
very
good
and
he
made
some
great
kicks
out
of
hand
and
thats
without
even
mentioning
his
majestic
matchwinning
penalty
but
i
think
we
need
to
wait
and
see
what
happens
because
he
needs
to
be
put
to
the
test
he
needs
to
come
up
against
brian
odriscoll
or
a
big
french
midfield
wales
flyhalf
stephen
jones
was
another
player
who
impressed
me
he
gave
good
direction
he
was
very
confident
and
he
was
a
nice
general
for
his
side
he
showed
he
can
control
a
game
with
jonny
wilkinson
not
playing
at
the
moment
due
to
inury
the
number
shirt
could
be
up
for
grabs
and
jones
or
maybe
even
henson
could
make
the
lions
team
at
flyhalf
jones
stuck
his
hand
up
and
he
certainly
looks
a
better
bet
than
charlie
hodgson
after
saturdays
game
some
of
the
wales
forwards
surprised
me
because
i
thought
they
would
be
outmuscled
in
the
tight
five
england
prop
julian
white
is
a
capable
player
but
when
it
comes
down
to
selection
gethin
jenkins
is
now
going
to
have
the
upper
hand
because
he
came
out
on
top
however
i
still
think
white
and
phil
vickery
will
be
in
the
frame
some
english
players
did
their
cause
no
harm
i
thought
joe
worsley
had
a
solid
game
and
jason
robinson
and
josh
lewsey
both
did
nothing
wrong
but
it
looked
too
soon
for
young
mathew
tait
and
i
think
it
will
be
a
while
before
we
see
him
again
despite
being
written
off
beforehand
several
scots
caught
my
eye
against
france
tom
smith
has
been
there
and
done
it
before
but
the
likes
of
chris
cusiter
jason
white
and
ally
hogg
all
made
their
mark
hogg
made
a
couple
of
good
runs
while
white
had
a
pretty
robust
game
his
defence
is
right
up
there
cusiter
looked
very
lively
and
he
could
be
a
very
good
option
for
lions
coach
sir
clive
woodward
the
star
of
irelands
win
over
italy
in
rome
looks
like
a
certainty
to
make
the
starting
xv
against
new
zealand
brian
odriscoll
is
a
class
act
he
ran
some
good
lines
against
italy
made
the
breaks
and
fed
his
outside
backs
although
italy
defended
man
on
man
which
made
it
easy
for
him
gordon
darcy
was
unlucky
to
go
off
injured
early
on
but
i
think
you
could
get
a
henson
darcy
odriscoll
combination
in
the
lions
midfield
paul
oconnell
just
needs
to
add
a
hard
edge
to
his
game
and
malcolm
okelly
keeps
on
going
and
seems
to
be
putting
his
hand
up
while
shane
byrne
seems
to
be
a
lively
character
but
they
will
be
a
bit
worried
after
the
italian
pack
drove
them
off
their
own
ball
on
sunday
although
i
used
to
play
in
italy
and
i
know
how
difficult
it
can
be
one
player
who
didnt
impress
me
was
wales
scrumhalf
dwayne
peel
he
choked
late
on
in
the
second
half
when
wales
were
trailing
they
had
good
possession
and
he
kicked
the
ball
away
i
wouldnt
want
him
as
my
lions
scrumhalf
after
that
