japan
faces
stiff
competition
in
the
form
of
south

and
new

to
host
the

tokumasu
added
that
the

cohosted
by
japan
and
south

had
been
a
huge
success
as
well
as
having
the
infrastructure
in
place
japan
also
has
the
commercial
clout
to
host
one
of
sports
top
competitions

japan
launched
its
first
professional
