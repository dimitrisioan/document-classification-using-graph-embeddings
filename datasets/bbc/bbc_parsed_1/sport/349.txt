italy
aim
to
rattle
england
italy
coach
john
kirwan
believes
his
side
can
upset
england
as
the
six
nations
wooden
spoon
battle
hots
up
the
two
sides
both
without
a
win
meet
on
march
at
twickenham
and
kirwan
says
his
side
will
be
hoping
to
make
the
most
of
englands
current
slump
we
have
to
make
sure
the
england
and
france
games
are
tough
for
them
england
have
not
been
having
the
best
of
championships
that
is
a
big
one
for
us
and
them
and
i
am
sure
my
players
will
rise
to
the
occasion
he
said
but
kirwan
admits
that
a
lot
of
hard
work
will
be
needed
with
his
kickers
before
the
trip
to
london
roland
de
marigny
and
luciano
orquera
had
a
miserable
time
with
the
boot
in
the
dire
defeat
to
scotland
as
chris
paterson
stole
the
show
to
give
the
hosts
a
muchneeded
victory
kirwan
said
the
kicking
was
the
decisive
factor
in
scotland
which
cost
us
and
it
could
go
down
to
the
kicking
again
next
time
but
i
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
my
players
and
i
am
positive
we
can
put
everything
together
against
england
england
meanwhile
are
licking
their
wounds
and
rueing
what
might
have
been
had
two
decisions
from
referee
jonathan
kaplan
not
gone
against
them
in
the
second
half
in
dublin
first
mark
cueto
was
judged
offside
as
he
chased
flyhalf
charlie
hodgsons
kick
and
then
kaplan
opted
not
to
call
upon
video
evidence
to
see
if
josh
lewsey
had
touched
down
after
being
driven
over
irelands
line
but
centre
jamie
noon
believes
the
side
at
least
showed
better
form
than
their
previous
two
defeats
we
definitely
improved
against
an
inform
irish
side
he
said
we
went
to
dublin
quietly
confident
that
we
would
be
able
to
compete
and
i
think
we
showed
that
we
have
got
to
make
sure
we
now
take
the
form
and
positives
into
the
italy
game
we
are
under
no
illusions
that
it
is
going
to
be
easy
but
we
definitely
need
a
win
england
have
now
equalled
an
year
low
of
four
successive
championship
defeats
including
france
in
paris
last
season
and
have
lost
four
in
a
row
under
andy
robinson
his
predecessor
sir
clive
woodward
began
his
sevenyear
reign
with
three
defeats
and
two
draws
