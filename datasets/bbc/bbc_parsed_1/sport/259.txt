benitez
deflects
blame
from
dudek
liverpool
manager
rafael
benitez
has
refused
to
point
the
finger
of
blame
at
goalkeeper
jerzy
dudek
after
portsmouth
claimed
a
draw
at
anfield
dudek
fumbled
a
cross
before
lomana
lualua
headed
home
an
injurytime
equaliser
levelling
after
steven
gerrard
put
liverpool
ahead
benitez
said
it
was
difficult
for
jerzy
it
was
an
unlucky
moment
he
was
expecting
a
cross
from
matthew
taylor
and
it
ended
up
like
a
shot
so
i
dont
blame
him
for
what
happened
benitez
admitted
it
was
a
costly
loss
of
two
points
by
liverpool
who
followed
up
their
derby
defeat
against
everton
with
a
disappointing
draw
he
said
we
had
many
opportunities
but
didnt
score
and
in
the
end
a
lead
was
not
enough
if
you
dont
have
any
chances
you
have
to
think
of
other
things
but
when
you
are
creating
so
many
chances
as
we
are
there
is
nothing
you
can
say
to
the
players
it
was
a
pity
we
lost
two
points
but
we
have
one
more
point
in
the
table
now
we
have
another
difficult
game
against
newcastle
and
we
have
to
recover
quickly
from
that
