bwalya
warned
his

not

i
dont
want
my
team
to
be
too
comfortable
or
too
sure
of
victory
as
it
is
going
to
be
a
difficult
game
for
me
the
main
aim
of
the
game
is
to
enjoy
and
to
win
zambia
have
shown
their
determination
to
win
this
final
by
recalling
nine
of
their
foreignbased
players
however
the
yearold
bwalya
who
became
the
oldest
player
to
appear
in
the
competition
when
he
played
and
scored
against
mauritius
is
uncertain
whether
he
will
take
to
the
field
or
not
the
chipolopolo
fans
however
are
not
being
so
cautious
with
a
victory

already
scheduled

sides
are
hoping
to
win
the
competition
for
a
record
third
time

in
