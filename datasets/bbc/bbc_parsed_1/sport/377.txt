on

helped
the

to
a
lead
at
halftime
three
further
ogara
penalties
extended
irelands
lead
to
as
the
game
entered
the
final
quarter
two
percy
montgomery
penalties
set
up
a
frantic
finish
but
ireland
held
out
to
claim
a
famous
victory
ireland
began
strongly
and
were
never
led
but
the
match
was
tense
and
closely
fought
throughout
aware
of
the
threat
posed
by
the
south
africans
ireland
pressed
hard
from
the
outset
and
played
some
impressive
rugby
while
searching
for
a
breakthrough
early
on
denis
hickie
thought
he
was
in
for
a
try
after
a
delightful
backline
move
but
shane
horgans
pass
was
adjudged
to
have
gone
forward
by
referee
paul
honiss
ireland
continued
to
press
and
they
showed
their
intent
by
opting
for
a
lineout
in
the
th
minute
when
three
straightforward
points
were
on
offer
another
south
african
infringement
a
minute
later
led
to
irelands
first
points
ogara
took
a
quick
tappenalty
and
charged
over
the
opposition
line
for
an
irish
try
the
springboks
could
feel
hard
done
by
as
captain
john
smit
had
his
back
to
the
play
when
ogara
pounced
after
referee
honiss
had
told
the
skipper
to
warn
his
own
players
after
consistent
infringements
stung
by
the
score
the
south
africans
almost
replied
with
a
try
of
their
own
within
seconds
with
geordan
murphys
ankletap
tackle
denying
a
certain
try
for
percy
montgomery
however
the
springboks
did
win
a
penalty
a
minute
later
which
montgomery
easily
slotted
to
cut
irelands
lead
to
ireland
got
out
of
jail
when
the
south
africans
had
a
threetoone
overlap
near
the
irish
line
only
to
waste
the
chance
after
the
sustained
springboks
pressure
the
irish
produced
an
attack
of
their
own
in
the
th
minute
which
culminated
with
ogaras
clever
dropgoal
to
restore
his
sides
lead
to
five
points
which
remained
the
margin
at
halftime
sustained
irish
pressure
immediately
after
halftime
was
rewarded
by
another
ogara
penalty
however
montgomery
responded
quickly
by
slotting
over
a
superb
penalty
from
near
the
right
touchline
to
cut
irelands
lead
to
five
points
again
montgomery
then
burst
through
the
irish
defence
in
the
th
minute
and
it
took
a
superb
girvan
dempsey
tackle
to
prevent
a
try
the
south
africans
suffered
a
doubleblow
in
the
nd
minute
when
schalk
burger
was
sinbinned
for
the
second
week
in
a
row
after
killing
the
ball
and
ogara
punished
the
transgression
by
notching
another
penalty
in
the
st
minute
hickie
was
left
frustrated
by
a
poor
pass
from
girvan
dempsey
as
a
chance
to
seal
the
match
was
wasted
however
a
late
tackle
on
brian
odriscoll
enabled
ogara
to
notch
another
penalty
in
the
rd
minute
which
extended
irelands
lead
to
however
two
montgomery
penalties
had
irelands
lead
in
peril
again
as
the
springboks
closed
to
within
five
points
with
seven
minutes
remaining
south
africa
produced
a
huge
effort
in
the
closing
minutes
but
ireland
held
on
to
claim
a
deserved
victory
