what
now
for
british
tennis
tim
henmans
decision
to
quit
davis
cup
tennis
has
left
the
british
team
with
a
gargantuan
void
to
fill
the
world
number
seven
is
tied
for
fourth
among
his
countrymen
for
wins
in
the
history
of
the
tournament
he
has
from
his
rubbers
and
great
britains
last
davis
cup
win
without
henman
came
against
slovenia
as
far
back
as
worse
could
follow
according
to
former
british
team
member
chris
bailey
bailey
told
bbc
sport
after
tims
announcement
i
doubt
greg
rusedski
will
be
that
far
behind
him
but
without
their
top
two
where
does
that
leave
british
ambitions
in
the
sports
premier
team
event
captain
jeremy
bates
has
singled
out
alex
bogdanovic
and
andrew
murray
as
potential
replacements
the
yugoslavianborn
bogdanovic
though
is
places
below
henman
in
the
world
rankings
and
has
played
just
two
cup
ties
winning
one
and
losing
the
other
murray
on
the
other
hand
is
th
in
the
current
atp
entry
list
and
yet
to
make
his
cup
debut
but
bailey
does
see
some
hope
for
the
future
he
said
now
weve
dropped
down
to
the
euroafrica
zone
the
time
was
right
for
him
to
step
down
and
let
the
young
guys
come
to
the
fore
britains
next
opponents
israel
are
hardly
likely
to
be
quaking
in
their
boots
ahead
of
the
march
match
against
a
likely
trio
of
bogdanovic
murray
and
the
thranked
arvind
parmar
bailey
said
it
will
be
tough
for
gb
to
move
up
but
there
comes
a
time
when
our
young
players
have
to
step
up
this
was
always
going
to
be
inevitable
with
tim
and
gregs
growing
years
im
confident
about
the
future
i
wouldnt
lay
money
on
us
getting
back
into
the
world
group
next
year
but
id
imagine
in
five
years
time
well
be
competing
for
the
major
honours
of
those
lining
up
to
replace
henman
the
yearold
murray
with
four
futures
titles
under
his
belt
last
year
looks
the
best
longterm
bet
murray
is
the
one
that
looks
likeliest
to
take
over
tims
mantle
said
bailey
he
has
an
enormous
amount
of
selfconfidence
judging
by
what
hes
said
in
the
past
bogdanovic
three
years
murrays
senior
has
had
a
more
troubled
time
under
britains
davis
cup
umbrella
while
murray
has
been
marked
out
as
britains
golden
boy
bogdanovic
was
warned
by
the
lawn
tennis
association
for
a
lack
of
drive
at
the
end
of
and
bailey
said
despite
that
alex
is
clearly
talented
as
well
while
arvind
is
another
contender
theyre
among
the
guys
who
have
experienced
the
intensity
of
davis
cup
tennis
whether
as
players
or
on
the
sidelines
the
lta
has
always
done
an
exceptional
job
of
ensuring
that
now
theyll
finally
get
to
play
regularly
in
the
cauldron
of
the
cup
and
im
confident
that
will
springboard
team
gb
to
greater
success
