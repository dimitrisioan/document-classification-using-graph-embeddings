the
croatian
eighth

one
henman
had
looked
on
course
to
level
the
match
after
going
up
in
the
second
set
but
his
progress
was
halted
as
the
rain
intervened
again

hit
back
after
the
break
to
seal
a
fourth

fifth
seed
tommy
robredo
secured
his
semifinal
place
when
he
beat
nicolas

of
germany
afterwards
henman
was
left
cursing
the
weather
and
the
umpire
after
seven
breaks
for
rain
during
the
match
it
was
incredibly
frustrating
henman
said
its
raining
and
the
umpire
doesnt
take
control
he
kept
telling
us
to
play
till
the
end
of
the
game
but
if
its
raining
you
come
off
the
scores
irrelevant
it
couldnt
be
more
frustrating
as
i
was
very
happy
with
my
form
until
now
you
dont
expect
this
in
the
desert
