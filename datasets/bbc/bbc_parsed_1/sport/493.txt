connors
rallying
cry
for
british
tennis
do
you
have
it
in
your
heart
how
much
guts
do
you
have
how
much
do
you
hate
to
lose
these
are
the
questions
jimmy
connors
will
be
asking
of
britains
brightest
tennis
hopes
in
the
months
and
possibly
years
to
come
the
american
legend
swept
into
london
on
thursday
to
announce
a
longterm
relationship
with
the
lawn
tennis
association
after
spending
three
days
at
the
elite
performance
winter
camp
in
la
manga
and
the
man
who
epitomised
the
phrase
will
to
win
before
lleyton
hewitt
was
even
born
is
clear
about
the
qualities
he
hopes
to
convey
you
know
everybody
hits
the
ball
well
and
theres
a
very
fine
line
between
number
one
and
number
said
connors
i
was
that
fine
line
for
a
long
time
but
if
i
can
help
i
want
to
be
part
of
teaching
kids
how
to
win
connors
is
not
the
first
great
name
to
offer
his
services
to
the
lta
his
longtime
rival
john
mcenroe
has
repeatedly
done
the
same
but
connors
is
at
pains
to
point
out
that
his
interest
goes
well
beyond
any
publicity
stunt
and
he
gave
a
glowing
recommendation
to
the
work
of
lta
performance
director
david
felgate
and
his
team
britain
has
a
different
attitude
the
right
attitude
in
taking
the
game
forward
and
finding
the
next
wimbledon
champion
said
connors
thats
something
you
dont
find
every
day
everybody
talks
a
good
game
but
not
everybody
puts
that
into
effect
the
impression
i
came
away
with
after
just
seeing
david
and
the
other
coaches
for
three
days
was
one
like
ive
never
seen
before
especially
over
here
this
is
not
going
to
happen
overnight
there
are
no
miracle
workers
but
youre
going
in
the
right
direction
the
yearolds
enthusiasm
for
the
work
going
on
in
this
country
is
in
marked
contrast
to
his
relationship
with
tennis
officials
back
in
america
ive
had
discussions
with
the
usta
united
states
tennis
association
over
a
number
of
years
he
said
thats
where
it
my
input
ended
connors
is
a
straighttalker
and
will
be
equally
blunt
and
honest
in
his
dealings
with
the
lta
and
the
cream
of
britains
young
players
if
theyre
chosen
theyve
got
to
produce
he
said
if
not
someone
will
come
and
take
their
place
theres
only
one
number
one
spot
and
its
lonely
up
there
but
its
got
the
best
view
in
the
year
that
has
seen
andrew
murray
emerge
as
britains
great
new
hope
connors
rejected
suggestions
that
the
scot
might
be
put
under
too
much
pressure
too
soon
tim
henman
has
a
whole
country
on
his
shoulder
said
connors
i
dont
know
that
pressure
but
if
you
like
that
it
can
be
a
certain
push
to
get
on
to
the
next
level
someones
going
to
have
to
come
and
take
over
from
him
henman
if
i
was
andrew
murray
id
embrace
that
thats
what
we
play
for
despite
the
emphasis
on
hard
work
training
and
preparation
connors
does
admit
that
the
desire
required
of
a
champion
has
to
come
from
within
the
passion
i
had
i
dont
know
if
you
can
find
that
he
admitted
i
was
also
nuts
i
say
that
because
there
was
nothing
better
for
me
than
to
compete
on
the
tennis
court
it
was
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
for
me
and
to
do
that
somethings
got
to
be
not
right
with
you
there
was
nothing
better
for
me
ever
than
to
play
tennis
in
front
of
people
what
i
had
when
i
played
tennis
is
what
i
am
you
have
to
have
that
you
cant
be
moulded
