fear
for
melbourne
andre
agassis
involvement
in
the
australian
open
was
put
in
doubt
after
he
pulled
out
of
the
kooyong
classic
with
a
hip
injury
agassi
was
serving
at
down
in
the
first
set
to
fellow
american
andy
roddick
when
he
decided
to
bring
a
premature
end
to
the
match
my
hip
was
cramping
and
i
just
could
not
continue
said
the
yearold
agassi
who
has
won
the
australian
open
four
times
will
have
an
mri
scan
to
discover
the
extent
of
the
damage
he
said
the
problem
was
not
the
same
as
the
hip
injury
which
forced
him
to
miss
wimbledon
last
year
the
good
news
is
that
it
didnt
just
tear
it
was
tightening
up
and
that
can
be
your
body
protecting
itself
which
is
hopefully
more
of
the
issue
he
added
that
wasnt
comfortable
out
there
at
all
what
i
was
feeling
i
have
to
wait
and
see
what
im
dealing
with
its
a
pretty
scary
feeling
out
there
when
something
doesnt
feel
right
and
is
getting
worse
its
very
disappointing
and
ill
have
to
do
my
best
to
deal
with
it
time
will
shortly
tell
if
it
the
australian
open
is
a
possibility
or
not
i
was
not
counting
on
this
being
the
end
of
the
day
for
me
maybe
in
a
few
days
ill
have
a
much
better
sense
of
what
my
hopes
will
be
