wales
silent
on
grand
slam
talk
rhys
williams
says
wales
are
still
not
thinking
of
winning
the
grand
slam
despite
a
third
six
nations
win
thats
the
last
thing
on
our
minds
at
the
moment
said
williams
a
second
half
replacement
in
saturdays
win
over
france
in
paris
we
all
realise
how
difficult
a
task
it
is
to
go
up
to
scotland
and
beat
them
weve
come
unstuck
there
a
couple
of
times
recently
so
our
focus
is
on
that
game
and
well
worry
about
ireland
hopefully
after
weve
beaten
scotland
with
captain
gareth
thomas
ruled
out
of
the
rest
of
the
campaign
with
a
broken
thumb
williams
is
vying
for
his
first
start
in
the
championship
so
far
kevin
morgan
is
probably
favourite
to
replace
thomas
at
fullback
leaving
williams
and
hal
luscombe
to
battle
for
the
right
wing
berth
a
hamstring
injury
denied
luscombe
the
opportunity
to
make
a
third
successive
start
but
the
dragons
winger
is
expected
to
be
fit
for
the
trip
to
murrayfield
on
march
hooker
robin
mcbryde
is
doubtful
after
picking
up
a
knee
injury
in
paris
but
centre
sonny
parker
and
flanker
colin
charvis
are
set
to
recover
from
injury
to
be
in
contention
for
selection
said
wales
assistant
coach
scott
johnson
theyve
worked
through
the
weekend
and
the
reports
are
a
bit
more
positive
so
were
getting
a
couple
back
and
that
adds
to
the
depth
of
the
squad
scotland
secured
their
first
win
of
the
campaign
on
saturday
by
grinding
out
an
win
over
italy
matt
williams
side
has
shown
little
in
attack
but
johnson
insisted
the
scots
will
be
difficult
opposition
to
break
down
italy
are
really
brave
opposition
and
sometimes
its
very
hard
to
win
he
said
so
an
ugly
win
can
be
just
as
effective
as
a
or
point
victory
scotland
are
a
hard
side
and
very
underrated
so
were
not
taking
anything
for
granted
were
not
basking
in
the
glory
of
winning
our
first
three
games
weve
got
to
be
diligent
in
our
preparation
thats
my
job
and
weve
got
to
make
sure
were
focused
