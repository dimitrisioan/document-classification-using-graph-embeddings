henman
came
from

sets
down
to
defeat
saulnier
in

faces
a
tough
test

never
gone
beyond
the
quarterfinals
in
the
years
first
major
and
is
lined
up
to
meet
roddick
in

tough
player
on
any
surface
hes
got
a
lot
of
ability
he
said
we
had
a
really
tight
one
in
paris
that
went
my
way
so
im
going
to
need
to
play
well
from
the
outset
because
hes
a
dangerous
competitor
switzerlands
federer
seeded
one
is
the
hot
favourite

won
three
of
the
four
grand
slam
titles
in
he
has
beaten
santoro
in
five
of
their
seven
previous
encounters
but
is
taking
nothing
for
granted
its
a
tricky
match
federer
said
i
played
him
at
the
us
open
and
won
quite
comfortably
then
but
you
never
know
if
the
rhythm
is
a
bit
off
he
can
keep
you
guessing
and
make
it
difficult
the
most
important
thing
though
is
to
get
used
to
playing
fiveset
matches
and
winning
them
the
yearold
could
meet
fourtime
