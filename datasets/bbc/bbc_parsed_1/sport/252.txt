boss
sir

ferguson
was
left
ruing
manchester
uniteds
failure
to
close
the
gap
on
chelsea
everton
and
arsenal
after
his
sides
draw
with
fulham
premiership
leaders
chelsea
and
the
gunners
endured
a
stalemate
on
sunday
giving
united
the
chance
to
make
up
some
ground
in
the
league
but
ferguson
said
i
think
what
makes
it
so
bad
is
that
both
our
rivals
dropped
points
at
the
weekend
it
was
a
great
opportunity
and
we
havent
delivered
united
went
ahead
through
alan
smith
in
the
rd
minute
before
bouba
diops
superb
yard
strike
cancelled
out
the
visitors
lead
in
the
th
minute
ferguson
described
the
result
as
an
absolute
giveaway
after
united
had
earlier
missed
a
host
of
opportunities
to
finish
off
the
encounter
he
said
it
was
a
good
performance
some
of
the
football
was
fantastic
but
we
just
didnt
finish
them
off
in
fairness
its
a
fantastic
strike
from
the
fulham
player
the
result
leaves
fergusons
side
fourth
in
the
league
on
points
four
points
behind
arsenal
and
a
further
five
back
from
chelsea
