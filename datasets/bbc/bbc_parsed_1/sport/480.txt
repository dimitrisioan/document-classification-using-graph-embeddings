agassi
put
in
an
erratic
display
before
edging
into
the
fourth
round
of
the
australian
open
with
victory
over
taylor
dent
the
yearold
american
seeded
eighth
made
a
poor
start
dropping
serve
early
on
and
later
needing
two
chances
to
serve
out
the
set
having
secured
the
lead
agassi
still
failed
to
take
control
as
both
players
forced
a
succession
of
breaks
but
agassi
won
the
tiebreak
before
wrapping
up
a
win
fourth
seed
survived
an
injury
scare
as
he
battled
past
mario
ancic
the
russian
turned
his
right
ankle
in
the
third
game
of
the
fourth
set
and
called
for
treatment
immediately
but
he
showed
no
sign
of
the
problem
when
he
returned
to
the
court
to
wrap
up
victory
in
two
hours
minutes
ancic
wimbledon
semifinalist
in
looked
set
to
push
safin
all
the
way
when
he
took
the
second
set
but
safin
raised
his
game
to
sink
the
croatian
safin
said
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
temper
under
control
at
this
years
tournament
the
russian
hit
himself
on
the
head
repeatedly
in
one
secondset
outburst
but
was
otherwise
largely
calm
in
his
victory
i
try
to
stay
calm
because
if
you
go
crazy
against
players
like
ancic
you
might
never
come
back
because
hes
a
tough
opponent
he
said
im
a
little
bit
calmer
than
i
was
before
because
id
had
enough
the
russian
added
that
he
was
not
worried
by
his
ankle
injury
i
have
had
a
lot
of
problems
with
that
ankle
before
it
will
be
ok
he
said
s
route
to
the
fourth
round
was
made
easy
when
opponent
jarkko
nieminen
was
forced
to
retire
from
their
match
the

seed
and
defending
champion
was
leading
when
nieminen
pulled
out
with
an

injury

admitted
he
was
under
extra
pressure
after
extending
his
winning
streak
to
a
careerbest
they
are
so
used
to
me
winning
but
its
not
that
simple
he
said
i
had
a
feeling
this
could
be
a
tough
match
i
had
a
bad
start
but
i
bounced
back
i
always
want
to
play
better
than
i
am
but
i
thought
i
was
pretty
ok
