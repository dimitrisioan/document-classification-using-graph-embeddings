jones
ready
for
hard
graft
adam
jones
says
the
wales
forwards
are
determined
to
set
the
perfect
attacking
platform
for
the
backs
by
dominating
the
powerful
france
pack
in
paris
the
prop
said
if
we
get
stuffed
in
the
front
five
our
backs
have
had
it
the
mentality
of
the
french
is
scrum
scrum
scrum
we
will
see
how
good
france
are
and
the
scrum
is
the
key
i
just
hope
the
backs
carry
on
where
they
left
off
against
italy
its
just
up
to
us
in
the
forwards
to
win
the
ball
and
give
them
the
opportunity
wales
have
won
two
of
their
last
three
visits
to
stade
de
france
having
secured
backtoback
wins
under
graham
henry
in
and
and
with
the
likes
of
shane
williams
and
gavin
henson
finding
top
form
at
the
right
time
mike
ruddocks
team
is
now
one
of
international
rugbys
most
potent
attacking
threats
gavin
is
ridiculously
talented
he
has
been
bouncing
around
the
place
this
week
so
he
is
up
for
it
warned
jones
france
have
been
criticised
for
their
uncharacteristic
onedimensional
play
in
their
victories
over
scotland
and
france
captain
fabien
pelous
has
acknowledged
his
side
needs
to
show
more
attacking
flair
but
stressed
the
game
with
be
won
or
lost
up
front
the
lock
believes
the
welsh
forwards
are
not
big
enough
to
trouble
his
side
in
the
scrum
or
lineout
but
jones
insisted
his
fellow
frontrow
colleagues
have
nothing
to
fear
gethin
jenkins
wont
be
intimidated
tomorrow
none
of
us
will
said
jones
who
will
be
facing
france
for
the
first
time
we
will
go
out
there
and
front
up
and
hopefully
get
the
ball
out
to
the
backs
me
and
gethin
are
quite
young
so
it
is
good
to
have
someone
of
mefins
experience
in
there
mefin
is
a
good
thinker
who
puts
things
across
but
what
is
the
saying
if
you
are
good
enough
you
are
old
enough
and
gethin
certainly
is
he
is
a
really
good
player
and
i
imagine
he
will
be
on
the
lions
tour
to
new
zealand
this
summer
