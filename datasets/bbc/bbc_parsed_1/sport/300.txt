duncan
bell
has
been
added
to
englands
man
squad
to
face
ireland
in
the
rbs
six
nations
and
with
phil
vickery
sidelined
for
at
least
six
weeks
with
a
broken
arm
and
julian
white
out
with
a
neck
injury
bell
could
make
his
england
debut
bell
had
set
his
sights
on
an
international
career
with
wales
but
last
december
the
international
rugby
board
confirmed
that
he
could
only
be
eligible
for
england
as
he
had
travelled
on
tour
with
them
in
england
coach
andy
robinson
could
take
a
gamble
and
call
inexperienced
sale
sharks
prop
andrew
sheridan
into
his
front
row
but
sheridan
favours
the
loosehead
side
of
the
scrum
and
a
more
likely
scenario
is
for
uncapped
bell
who
was
among
the
tryscorers
when
england
a
beat
france
a
nine
days
ago
to
be
drafted
in
robinson
also
has
an
injury
worry
over
centre
olly
barkley

withdrew
from
baths
starting
lineup
to
face
gloucester
last
weekend
he
was
due
to
have
a
hospital
scan
on
monday
while
gloucester
centre
henry
paul
who
started
at
flyhalf
against
bath
limped
out
at
kingsholm
because
of
an
ankle
problem
despite
barkleys
three
missed
penalties
in
the
defeat
against
france
he
is
expected
to
retain
his
place
at
inside
centre
although
leicesters
inform
prospect
ollie
smith
would
be
an
obvious
replacement
bath
coach
john
connolly
rates
barkley
as
no
better
than
a
chance
to
make
the
dublin
trip
uncapped
flyhalf
andy
goode
has
been
named
in
a
man
training
squad
for
the
ireland
game
and
he
strengthened
his
selection
claims
by
kicking
points
during
