williams
stays
on
despite
dispute
matt
williams
insists
he
has
no
thoughts
of
quitting
as
national
coach
as
a
result
of
the
power
struggle
currently
gripping
scottish
rugby
the
chairman
chief
executive
and
three
nonexecutive
directors
all
departed
in
a
row
over
the
games
future
direction
but
williams
said
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
im
committed
totally
to
scottish
rugby
ive
brought
my
family
here
and
weve
immersed
ourselves
in
scottish
life
theres
no
way
that
im
walking
away
however
he
attempted
to
steer
clear
of
taking
sides
in
the
dispute
id
like
to
stress
that
the
national
team
is
separate
to
the
political
situation
he
said
when
you
come
to
an
undertaking
like
this
and
you
are
trying
to
make
a
difference
then
there
are
always
people
who
will
begrudge
you
who
are
jealous
and
want
to
try
to
drag
you
down
when
you
have
that
situation
you
have
to
have
the
courage
of
your
convictions
to
see
it
through
there
was
some
very
unhelpful
and
uninformed
comment
that
the
national
team
had
received
a
massive
increase
in
budget
at
the
expense
of
other
parts
of
scottish
rugby
and
that
is
simply
not
the
case
like
all
good
coaches
you
go
and
ask
for
an
increase
but
we
were
told
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
financial
situation
did
not
allow
that
the
idea
that
we
are
lighting
cigars
with
â£
notes
while
the
rest
of
scottish
rugby
flounders
is
absolutely
untrue
we
also
attracted
criticism
because
of
the
number
of
days
players
spent
with
the
national
team
but
let
me
give
you
the
truth
our
irish
counterparts
whom
we
have
to
compete
with
in
a
few
days
time
had
days
together
at
the
summer
they
are
currently
in
camp
now
and
they
will
have
another
days
in
camp
before
the
six
nations
that
means
they
will
have
days
away
from
their
club
from
july
until
the
six
nations
we
on
the
other
hand
will
have
there
must
be
a
winwin
philosophy
and
attitude
within
scottish
rugby
and
that
is
what
we
are
after
both
groups
winning
not
competing
