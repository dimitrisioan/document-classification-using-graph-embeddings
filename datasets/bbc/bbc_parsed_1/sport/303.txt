jones
happy
with
henson
heroics
wales
flyhalf
stephen
jones
admitted
he
was
happy
to
hand
gavin
henson
responsibility
for
taking
the
matchwinning
kick
against
england
jones
had
missed
three
earlier
shots
at
goal
when
wales
down
were
awarded
a
longrange
penalty
with
four
minutes
left
in
cardiff
i
knew
the
percentages
of
gavin
reaching
it
were
far
higher
than
me
jones
said
when
he
said
he
wanted
it
there
were
no
problems
jones
had
seen
a
longrange
effort
fall
a
whisker
under
the
crossbar
on
the
hour
before
charlie
hodgson
put
england
in
front
with
minutes
left
i
looked
at
where
it
was
and
i
knew
i
was
going
to
struggle
to
make
it
jones
added
i
said
to
gareth
thomas
the
wales
captain
this
is
touch
and
go
it
was
out
of
my
range
and
obviously
gavin
is
phenomenal
when
it
comes
to
distance
he
was
confident
and
fancied
it
there
were
no
questions
that
hed
miss
it
the
way
he
was
playing
he
had
a
superb
game
jones
was
happy
to
hail
hensons
heroic
contribution
to
wales
first
win
over
england
in
cardiff
since
physically
hes
a
specimen
hes
a
balanced
player
he
glides
when
he
runs
and
obviously
hes
got
a
great
kicking
game
as
well
jones
said
his
defence
was
superb
he
made
some
great
hits
and
he
had
a
great
game
im
glad
hes
welsh
victory
over
england
for
the
first
time
since
will
no
doubt
fuel
expectations
of
what
wales
might
achieve
in
this
years
six
nations
but
they
now
face
three
away
fixtures
in
italy
france
and
scotland
before
completing
their
campaign
against
ireland
in
cardiff
people
all
over
the
world
want
to
see
wales
back
at
the
top
table
of
world
rugby
said
a
proud
coach
mike
ruddock
but
we
are
not
there
yet
the
next
step
is
finding
the
consistency
to
get
further
wins
we
have
to
travel
this
week
and
we
cant
afford
to
get
too
giddy
about
this
result
we
have
got
to
be
professional
and
keep
focused
on
facing
italy
none
more
so
than
henson
who
can
now
expect
to
have
the
same
sort
of
spotlight
thrust
upon
him
as
the
likes
of
jonny
wilkinson
and
brian
odriscoll
the
confident
yearold
is
undaunted
by
the
prospect
of
dealing
with
such
weighty
expectations
however
im
the
sort
of
player
who
likes
pressure
on
me
he
said
it
makes
me
more
concentrated
and
i
think
i
perform
better
under
more
pressure
i
set
a
high
standard
against
england
and
ive
got
to
back
it
up
next
week
two
years
ago
when
we
played
italy
i
wasnt
involved
and
we
lost
so
weve
got
to
put
that
right
next
week
