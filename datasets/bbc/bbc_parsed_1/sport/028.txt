sights
on
running
quicker
than
ever
after
deciding
not
to
retire
from
sprinting
campbell
who
won
olympic
xm
relay
gold
had
been
unsure
about
his
future
but
he
told
five
lives
sportsweek
i
had
to
get
back
into
training
before
i
could
decide
because
if
i
didnt
have
the
same
hunger
id
have
to
walk
away
ive
started
back
and
im
thoroughly
enjoying
it
im
looking
forward
to
it
ive
got
to
run
under
seconds
for
m
and
under
seconds
for
m
campbell
was
part
of
the
british
quartet
who
shocked
the
americans
to
win
relay
gold
in
athens
in
august
the
newportbased
athlete
and
teammates
jason
gardener
marlon
devonish
and
mark
lewisfrancis
were
rewarded
with
mbes
in
the
new
year
honours
list
campbells
relay
triumph
made
up
for
his
disappointing
displays
in
the
individual
m
and
m
events
in
athens
when
he
failed
to
reach
the
finals
the
yearold
who
won
olympic
m
silver
in
sydney
in
said
during
the
games
that
a
hamstring
injury
had
stopped
him
from
running
at
his
best
he
was
criticised
at
the
time
by
former
olympic
champion
michael
johnson
who
cast
doubt
on
campbells
injury
claims
to
go
to
athens
and
finally
get
the
gold
ive
been
trying
to
get
for
years
was
a
big
relief
said
campbell
it
was
a
chance
for
me
to
prove
that
if
id
been
fit
i
would
have
been
challenging
for
the
individual
medals
every
season
i
go
and
challenge
for
the
medals
so
why
would
last
season
have
been
any
different
its
just
unfortunate
that
i
picked
up
that
injury
just
before
the
olympics
campbell
set
his
m
personal
best
of
secs
when
he
won
the
european
title
in
budapest
in
and
he
ran
secs
in
the
quarterfinals
of
the
m
in
sydney
on
the
way
to
olympic
silver
