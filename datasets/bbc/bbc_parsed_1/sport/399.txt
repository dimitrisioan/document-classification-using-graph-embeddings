farrell
saga
to
drag
on
lindsay
wigan
chairman
maurice
lindsay
says
he
does
not
expect
a
quick
solution
to
the
ongoing
saga
of
captain
andy
farrells
possible
switch
to
rugby
union
leicester
and
saracens
are
leading
the
chase
for
the
player
but
lindsay
told
the
bbc
it
was
not
yet
a
done
deal
as
well
as
the
rugby
football
union
the
league
the
individual
club
and
the
england
coaching
team
have
a
say
so
its
not
a
quick
decision
he
said
hes
given
us
years
service
so
if
he
wants
to
go
wed
support
him
the
prospect
of
farrell
switching
codes
has
been
the
main
talking
point
of
the
super
league
season
so
far
it
came
as
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
to
us
admitted
lindsay
but
hes
a
very
loyal
friend
to
the
club
so
theres
no
question
that
hes
deserting
us
he
just
fancies
a
challenge
although
the
move
would
be
a
lucrative
one
for
both
farrell
and
wigan
lindsay
said
money
was
not
a
motivating
factor
for
the
club
the
money
side
of
things
hasnt
been
concluded
but
its
not
the
point
for
wigan
he
told
radio
five
live
a
shortage
of
money
has
never
been
a
problem
for
us
even
if
we
did
have
it
under
the
salary
cap
we
cant
spend
a
penny
of
it
anyway
wed
rather
have
the
player
lindsay
also
said
he
understood
why
rugby
union
was
so
interested
in
signing
up
farrell
itd
be
a
great
loss
for
us
but
a
great
boost
for
them
said
the
warriors
chief
this
guy
is
an
absolute
sporting
icon
hes
been
at
the
top
for
so
long
and
has
demonstrated
so
many
attributes
that
you
need
to
make
it
in
a
tough
contact
sport
athletes
like
him
ellery
hanley
and
martin
johnson
dont
come
along
very
often
youre
very
lucky
to
have
them
whilst
youve
got
them
