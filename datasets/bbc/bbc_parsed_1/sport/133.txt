finnan
says
irish
can
win
group
steve
finnan
believes
the
republic
of
ireland
can
qualify
directly
for
the
world
cup
finals
after
saturdays
superb
display
in
the
draw
in
paris
ireland
face
minnows
the
faroe
islands
in
dublin
on
wednesday
the
versatile
finnan
who
starred
against
the
french
is
confident
the
group
is
irelands
for
the
taking
there
is
a
chance
for
us
now
to
go
on
win
our
home
games
and
why
not
win
the
group
even
though
its
a
tough
one
said
the
liverpool
player
switzerland
ireland
france
and
israel
are
all
now
tied
on
five
points
from
three
matches
although
the
republic
look
to
have
a
slight
edge
after
claiming
away
draws
in
basel
and
paris
in
basel
we
did
not
play
great
football
but
when
you
to
go
to
these
places
the
other
teams
are
going
to
have
the
majority
of
the
game
in
paris
we
looked
good
throughout
the
team
and
a
point
was
the
least
we
deserved
because
we
had
a
number
of
chances
looking
back
we
had
an
opportunity
to
get
the
three
points
but
we
are
happy
with
a
point
and
that
will
give
us
confidence
going
into
wednesdays
game
on
paper
we
have
got
the
toughest
matches
out
of
the
way
and
we
have
set
standards
for
ourselves
automatic
qualification
is
there
it
would
certainly
be
good
to
avoid
a
playoff
but
on
the
back
of
a
couple
of
good
results
i
dont
see
why
we
cant
win
the
group
manager
brian
kerr
was
keen
to
mention
the
contribution
of
stephen
carr
and
finnan
on
irelands
right
flank
at
the
stade
de
france
finnans
normal
position
is
rightback
but
he
looked
assured
in
a
more
advanced
position
against
the
french
as
i
play
on
the
right
for
my
club
and
being
a
natural
rightback
it
was
something
he
kerr
looked
at
because
france
play
strongly
down
the
lefthand
side
so
i
was
happy
to
play
and
stephen
carr
and
i
enjoyed
the
game
particularly
as
the
defence
and
midfield
held
together
well
and
nullified
their
attacks
