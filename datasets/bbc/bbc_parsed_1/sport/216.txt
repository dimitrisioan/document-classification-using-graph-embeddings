reaction
from
spanish
press
englands
defeat
to
spain
on
wednesday
dominated
the
back
and
front
pages
of
the
countrys
press
on
thursday
controversy
was
in
no
short
supply
with
racist
abuse
of
englands
black
players
wayne
rooneys
petulance
and
englands
inept
performance
but
what
did
the
spanish
press
make
of
the
affair
bbc
sport
looks
at
the
reaction
there
is
little
coverage
of
the
racist
chanting
on
wednesday
nights
game
but
as
does
cover
the
english
reaction
to
the
prematch
comments
from
spain
coach
luis
aragones
who
highlighted
britains
colonial
past
when
probed
about
his
own
remarks
regarding
thierry
henry
in
october
journalist
guillem
balague
writes
in
our
country
where
multiculturalism
is
a
new
thing
we
are
in
nappies
dealing
with
these
things
and
have
a
naivety
which
makes
the
english
nervous
marca
refers
in
passing
to
the
booing
of
englands
black
players
but
only
after
referring
to
the
cheers
of
ole
which
greeted
the
long
periods
of
spanish
possession
aragones
no
comment
to
questions
about
racism
after
the
match
is
also
highlighted
as
marca
focuses
on
the
spanish
coachs
praise
for
his
players
serbia
montenegros
world
cup
qualifying
win
in
belgium
which
could
make
qualification
tougher
for
spain
seems
to
be
of
greater
importance
elsewhere
the
spanish
media
criticises
its
english
counterparts
for
stoking
up
the
racism
issue
were
there
racist
chants
against
some
players
this
hasnt
happened
in
the
spanish
league
and
spain
for
many
years
said
spanish
federation
press
officer
fernando
garrido
so
you
english
reporters
should
ask
yourselves
what
you
have
done
to
contribute
to
all
this
and
spanish
daily
abc
accuses
english
reporters
of
launching
a
witchhunt
against
aragones
perhaps
it
was
because
their
team
had
played
so
poorly
and
they
wanted
to
divert
attention
towards
this
muddled
issue
the
paper
says
what
the
boy
in
the
bernabeu
did
was
odd
rooney
seemed
intent
to
kick
any
spanish
player
who
approached
him
yet
rooney
is
seen
only
as
the
worst
example
of
many
england
miscreants
with
gary
neville
criticised
for
continuing
the
feud
between
manchester
united
and
arsenal
for
his
tackles
on
jose
reyes
ashley
coles
treatment
of
joaquin
and
a
frank
lampard
foul
on
reyes
are
also
lambasted
for
their
ugliness
marcas
headline
says
it
all
wayne
rooney
se
volvi
loco
en
el
bernabu
wayne
rooney
became
crazy
in
the
bernabeu
rooneys
display
alarms
the
writer
in
particular
three
chilling
fouls
on
joaquin
casillas
and
marchena
which
could
well
have
left
them
in
the
infirmary
and
like
as
marca
criticises
gary
neville
for
leaving
a
message
on
reyes
ankle
to
remind
him
of
the
manchester
unitedarsenal
clash
this
month
spains
firsthalf
performance
is
showered
with
praise
with
xavi
singled
out
as
the
biggest
star
xavi
did
things
on
wednesday
which
were
worthy
of
maradona
the
paper
beams
adding
what
a
workrate
what
dynamism
what
vision
what
leadership
what
a
midfield
player
on
a
controversial
evening
as
offers
one
seemingly
undeniable
viewpoint
spanish
football
players
played
better
football
than
the
english
more
plaudits
are
given
to
the
home
team
with
jaime
vargas
lauding
the
manner
in
which
spain
dominated
england
with
order
and
quality
the
paper
adds
the
bad
thing
about
spain
v
england
was
that
it
lasted
only
minutes
after
which
a
succession
of
changes
prevented
any
real
competition
vargas
does
not
mention
englands
two
galacticos
simply
adding
in
a
ps
i
have
not
forgotten
to
speak
of
beckham
and
owen
they
forgot
to
play
