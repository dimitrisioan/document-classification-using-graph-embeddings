tv
calls
after
carroll
error
spurs
boss
martin
jol
said
his
team
were
robbed
at
manchester
united
after
pedro
mendes
shot
clearly
crossed
the
line
but
was
not
given
the
referee
is
already
wearing
an
earpiece
so
why
cant
we
just
stop
the
game
and
get
the
decision
right
said
jol
after
the
draw
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
so
obvious
that
pedros
shot
was
over
the
line
its
incredible
we
feel
robbed
but
its
difficult
for
the
linesman
and
referee
to
see
it
mendes
shot
from
yards
and
united
goalkeeper
roy
carroll
spilled
the
ball
into
his
own
net
before
hooking
it
clear
jol
added
we
are
not
talking
about
the
ball
being
a
couple
of
centimetres
or
an
inch
or
two
over
the
line
it
was
a
metre
inside
the
goal
what
really
annoys
me
is
that
we
are
here
in
watching
something
on
a
tv
monitor
within
two
seconds
of
the
incident
occurring
and
the
referee
isnt
told
about
it
we
didnt
play
particularly
well
but
i
am
pleased
even
now
with
a
point
although
we
should
have
had
three
mendes
could
not
believe
the
goal
was
not
given
after
seeing
a
replay
he
said
my
reaction
on
the
pitch
was
to
celebrate
it
was
a
very
nice
goal
it
was
clearly
over
the
line
ive
never
seen
one
so
over
the
line
and
not
given
in
my
career
its
really
really
over
what
can
you
do
but
laugh
about
it
its
a
nice
goal
and
one
to
keep
in
my
memory
even
though
it
didnt
count
its
not
every
game
you
score
from
the
halfway
line
manchester
united
manager
sir
alex
ferguson
sympathised
with
tottenham
and
said
the
incident
highlighted
the
need
for
video
technology
i
think
it
hammers
home
what
a
lot
of
people
have
been
asking
for
and
thats
that
technology
should
play
a
part
in
the
game
ferguson
told
mutv
what
i
was
against
originally
was
the
time
factor
in
video
replays
but
i
read
an
article
the
other
day
which
suggested
that
if
a
referee
cant
make
up
his
mind
after
seconds
of
watching
a
video
replay
then
the
game
should
carry
on
thirty
seconds
is
about
the
same
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
organise
a
freekick
or
take
a
corner
or
a
goalkick
so
you
wouldnt
be
wasting
a
lot
of
time
i
think
you
could
start
off
by
using
it
for
goalline
decisions
i
think
that
would
be
an
opening
into
a
new
area
of
football
arsenal
boss
arsene
wenger
also
used
the
incident
to
highlight
the
need
for
video
technology
when
the
whole
world
apart
from
the
referee
has
seen
there
should
be
a
goal
at
old
trafford
that
just
reinforces
what
i
feel
there
should
be
video
evidence
said
wenger
its
a
great
example
of
where
the
referee
could
have
asked
to
see
a
replay
and
would
have
seen
in
five
seconds
that
it
was
a
goal
