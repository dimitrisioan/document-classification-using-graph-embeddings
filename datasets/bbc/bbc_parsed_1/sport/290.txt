ireland
victory
ireland
flyhalf
ronan
ogara
hailed
his
sides
victory
over
england
as
a
special
win
the
munster
number
kicked
a
total
of
points
including
two
drop
goals
to
help
keep
alive
their
grand
slam
hopes
he
told
bbc
sport
we
made
hard
work
of
it
but
its
still
special
to
beat
england
i
had
three
chances
to
win
the
game
but
didnt
we
have
work
to
do
after
this
but
we
never
take
a
victory
over
england
lightly
ireland
hooker
shane
byrne
echoed
ogaras
comments
but
admitted
the
game
had
been
englands
best
outing
in
the
six
nations
byrne
said
it
was
a
really
really
hard
game
but
from
one
to
in
our
team
we
worked
really
really
hard
we
just
had
to
stick
to
our
defensive
pattern
trust
ourselves
and
trust
those
around
us
all
round
it
was
fantastic
ireland
captain
brian
odriscoll
who
scored
his
sides
only
try
said
we
are
delighted
we
felt
if
we
performed
well
then
we
would
win
but
with
england
also
having
played
very
well
it
makes
it
all
the
sweeter
we
did
get
the
bounce
of
the
ball
and
some
days
that
happens
and
youve
just
got
to
jump
on
the
back
of
it
ireland
coach
eddie
osullivan
was
surprised
that
england
coach
andy
robinson
said
he
was
certain
mark
cueto
was
onside
for
a
disallowed
try
just
before
the
break
andy
was
sitting
two
yards
from
me
and
i
couldnt
see
whether
he
was
offside
or
not
so
i
dont
know
how
andy
could
have
known
said
osullivan
what
i
do
know
is
that
england
played
well
and
when
that
happens
it
makes
a
very
good
victory
for
us
we
had
to
defend
for
long
periods
and
that
is
all
good
for
the
confidence
of
the
team
i
think
our
try
was
very
well
worked
it
was
a
gem
as
good
a
try
as
we
have
scored
for
a
while
osullivan
also
rejected
robinsons
contention
england
dominated
the
forward
play
i
think
we
lost
one
lineout
and
they
lost
four
or
five
so
i
dont
know
how
that
adds
up
to
domination
he
said
odriscoll
also
insisted
ireland
were
happy
to
handle
the
pressure
of
being
considered
favourites
to
win
the
six
nations
title
this
season
for
the
first
time
we
have
been
able
to
play
with
the
favourites
tag
he
said
hopefully
we
have
proved
that
today
and
can
continue
to
keep
doing
so
as
for
my
try
it
was
a
move
we
had
worked
on
all
week
there
was
a
bit
of
magic
from
geordan
murphy
and
it
was
a
great
break
from
denis
hickie
