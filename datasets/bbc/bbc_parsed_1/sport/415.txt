wilkinson
to
miss
ireland
match
england
will
have
to
take
on
ireland
in
the
six
nations
without
captain
and
goalkicker
jonny
wilkinson
according
to
his
newcastle
boss
rob
andrew
wilkinson
who
had
targeted
the
february
match
for
his
international
comeback
has
been
missed
by
england
not
least
for
his
goalkicking
jonnys
not
fit
yet
falcons
chief
andrew
told
bbc
radio
five
live
he
wont
be
fit
for
dublin
theres
no
doubt
about
that
but
he
might
be
fit
for
scotland
and
italy
the
yearold
has
not
played
for
england
since
the
world
cup
final
after
a
succession
of
injuries
england
who
have
lost
three
six
nations
games
in
a
row
wasted
a
halftime
lead
in
their
defeat
to
france
goalkickers
charlie
hodgson
and
olly
barkley
missed
six
penalty
attempts
and
a
dropgoal
between
them
theyve
probably
got
two
of
the
best
english
kickers
in
the
premiership
in
hodgson
and
barkley
added
andrew
a
former
england
flyhalf
and
goalkicker
theyre
both
pretty
good
kickers
charlie
is
a
good
kicker
weekin
weekout
but
its
all
about
pressure
and
unfortunately
england
are
just
not
handling
the
pressure
at
the
moment
andrew
also
blamed
englands
poor
run
of
recent
results
on
a
lack
of
leadership
in
the
side
following
several
highprofile
retirements
and
injuries
they
just
didnt
have
that
leadership
that
would
have
seen
them
through
martin
johnson
lawrence
dallaglio
and
jonny
are
obviously
huge
losses
and
leadership
is
so
important
in
those
situations
he
said
i
think
it
is
really
difficult
for
jason
robinson
to
lead
the
side
effectively
from
fullback
meanwhile
former
england
fullback
dusty
hare
put
englands
mistakes
down
to
a
lack
of
mental
toughness
jonny
wilkinson
has
proved
himself
a
cool
customer
with
around
an
kicking
success
rate
hare
told
bbc
radio
five
live
but
naturalborn
toughness
comes
into
it
as
well
as
all
the
practice
you
do
you
have
to
be
able
to
shut
out
all
the
outside
elements
and
concentrate
on
putting
the
ball
between
the
posts
hodgson
who
has
an
excellent
kicking
record
with
club
side
sale
sharks
has
introduced
crowd
noise
into
his
practice
routine
of
late
the
top
golfers
dont
hit
the
fairway
every
time
and
it
is
the
same
with
goalkicking
hare
added
you
need
that
mental
toughness
as
well
to
put
the
ball
over
but
great
goalkickers
like
jonny
wilkinson
come
along
very
rarely
