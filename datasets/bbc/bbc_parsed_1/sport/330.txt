england
former
australian
wing
david
campese
has
told
england
to
stop
whingeing
in
the
wake
of
their
defeat
to
ireland
england
coach
andy
robinson
lambasted
referee
jonathan
kaplan
for
costing
them
the
game
after
disallowing
tries
from
mark
cueto
and
josh
lewsey
but
campese
told
bbc
sport
robinson
is
living
up
to
englands
reputation
as
whingeing
poms
stop
going
on
about
it
as
who
really
cares
theyre
acting
like
theyre
the
first
team
to
be
cheated
of
a
win
england
are
contemplating
a
complaint
to
the
international
rugby
board
after
potential
tries
by
cueto
in
the
first
half
and
lewsey
late
on
were
ruled
out
without
recourse
to
the
video
referee
but
campese
added
scotland
could
have
beaten
france
in
the
same
way
but
do
you
see
them
whingeing
basically
things
didnt
go
englands
way
and
in
typical
fashion
they
make
more
of
it
when
they
believe
theyve
lost
unfairly
england
are
second
bottom
in
the
six
nations
table
following
defeats
by
wales
france
and
ireland
but
although
campese
admitted
he
was
surprised
about
their
current
predicament
he
insisted
england
were
no
longer
world
class
england
are
beginning
to
realise
that
being
world
champions
doesnt
mean
you
deserve
to
win
every
game
he
said
they
lost
a
few
key
players
and
suddenly
everyones
realised
the
ones
on
the
fringes
were
not
all
that
good
in
the
first
place
added
to
that
the
senior
players
arent
standing
up
and
they
cant
do
anything
when
the
pressure
mounts
campese
a
veteran
of
international
caps
said
fullback
jason
robinson
would
now
be
the
sole
englishman
in
his
world
xv
robinson
has
been
blamed
for
poor
leadership
in
the
tournament
while
his
coach
has
been
castigated
for
appointing
a
fullback
captain
i
agree
that
you
cant
captain
from
fullback
said
campese
you
need
someone
in
the
thick
of
the
action
and
its
very
hard
to
give
orders
from
all
the
way
back
there
some
people
are
leaders
and
some
arent
hes
not
but
theres
no
one
who
stands
out
in
englands
pack
no
clearcut
leaders
campese
though
defended
coach
andy
robinson
who
he
believes
was
the
only
choice
after
sir
clive
woodwards
resignation
but
he
blamed
a
lack
of
talent
in
the
england
camp
for
making
the
current
coach
look
poor
england
face
a
potential
wooden
spoon
match
against
italy
on
march
and
the
exwallaby
added
if
england
lost
that
theyd
be
in
bloody
turmoil
that
said
i
dont
think
they
will
campese
has
tipped
wales
to
win
both
the
six
nations
and
grand
slam
come
the
end
of
the
tournament
its
been
a
surprising
tournament
he
said
and
maybe
ireland
have
a
little
bit
more
talent
overall
but
playing
at
home
is
a
major
boost
and
the
possible
grand
slam
decider
at
the
millennium
stadium
will
be
just
too
much
for
the
irish
