nervous
and
i
couldnt
play
tennis
said
safin
he
started
really
well
he
wasnt
as
nervous
as
i
was
because
i
was
thinking
of
the
two
finals
that
i
played
and
wasnt
successful
he
added
you
really
have
to
deal
with
the
pressure
because
normally
it
never
happens
but
when
you
come
to
the
final
you
are
so
tight
because
you
want
to
win
i
tried
to
play
some
tennis
but
i
couldnt
he

won
two
grand
slam
titles
hes
won
titles
hes
a
great
player
and
he
deals
with
pressure
from
down
in
the
third
set
safin
played
some
of
his
best
tennis
to
reel
off
seven
games
and
take
control
of
the
match
in
the
third
set
just
all
of
a
sudden
it
all
turn
around
completely
in
a
way
i
couldnt
expect
said
safin
because
he
made
a
couple
of
mistakes
i
was
a
little
bit
lucky
at
some
point
then
the
confidence
came
back
and
i
was
back
in
the
game
and
the
russian
revealed
that
the
victory
and
his
semifinal
win
over
world
number
one
roger
federer
had
given
him
a
massive
boost
for
the
future
you
get
huge
confidence
because
roger
is
a
great
player
said
safin
once
i
beat
him
and
then
lleyton
its
like

so
much
confidence
in
yourself
that
you

can
win
big
titles
and
you
can
beat
huge
players
in
the
finals
