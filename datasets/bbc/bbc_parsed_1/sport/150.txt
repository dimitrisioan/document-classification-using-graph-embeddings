at
professional
cup
win
tottenham
manager
martin
jol
acclaimed
his
players
for
their
patience
in
their
fa
cup
fifthround
victory
over
a
determined
nottingham
forest
side
we
had
the
initiative
but
it
wasnt
easy
it
was
a
professional
sort
of
performance
the
dutchman
said
forest
played
with
a
lot
of
players
behind
the
ball
in
the
first
half
but
at
they
were
dead
and
buried
looking
ahead
to
the
quarterfinal
jol
said
newcastle
have
got
a
very
good
side
and
they
are
always
difficult
however
he
added
that
his
side
who
are
four
places
above
the
magpies
in
the
premiership
were
not
afraid
of
anyone
robbie
keane
skipper
for
the
night
and
scorer
of
the
crucial
second
goal
echoed
his
managers
sentiments
on
the
lasteight
match
theyre
on
a
high
but
were
confident
and
in
the
last
few
games
weve
played
well
and
hopefully
we
can
go
there
and
get
the
win
he
said
he
conceded
the
win
over
forest
which
included
goals
from
noe
pamarot
and
mido
was
not
pretty
to
watch
it
wasnt
the
best
display
but
its
all
about
the
result
the
irishman
said
we
knew
it
was
going
to
be
difficult
with
the
conditions
the
pitch
wasnt
the
best
but
we
still
tried
to
pass
it
we
dug
in
and
the
gaffer
said
to
us
at
halftime
to
keep
being
patient
and
that
the
goal
will
come
forest
manager
gary
megson
conceded
his
team
did
not
deserve
anything
after
a
poor
performance
if
you
play
like
we
did
and
concede
two
goals
from
corners
youre
going
to
have
an
uphill
battle
against
a
very
good
team
he
said
if
we
defend
in
the
championship
like
we
did
well
not
get
another
point
we
were
organised
but
i
felt
at
times
we
thought
the
system
would
be
enough
but
we
didnt
look
like
scoring
