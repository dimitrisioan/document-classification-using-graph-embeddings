liverpool
revel
in
night
of
glory
liverpool
manager
rafael
benitez
said
their
qualification
for
the
next
stage
of
the
champions
league
was
one
of
the
proudest
nights
of
my
career
the
reds
beat
olympiakos
with
a
late
steven
gerrard
strike
and
benitez
said
it
was
a
really
great
night
the
players
ran
hard
all
the
time
and
you
see
how
much
it
means
to
the
fans
we
knew
before
the
game
that
it
was
very
important
for
the
club
to
gain
these
extra
finances
for
liverpool
this
result
is
very
very
important
benitez
hailed
gerrard
for
his
matchwinning
strike
four
minutes
from
time
and
also
the
anfield
crowd
for
sticking
by
their
side
after
they
had
fallen
a
goal
behind
at
the
interval
the
reds
scored
three
secondhalf
goals
in
a
sensational
comeback
capped
by
gerrards
yard
drive
he
added
steven
can
play
all
over
the
pitch
and
he
influences
every
part
of
the
game
i
have
said
to
him
many
times
that
he
has
the
freedom
because
he
has
talent
and
is
very
important
to
us
i
felt
that
the
difference
between
the
sides
was
really
our
supporters
i
can
not
thank
them
enough
i
want
to
say
thankyou
to
the
supporters
they
were
magnificent
to
help
us
achieve
this
result
gerrard
admitted
he
thought
they
were
going
out
of
the
champions
league
after
trailing
at
halftime
he
said
id
be
lying
if
i
thought
we
were
going
through
when
we
were
losing
at
halftime
we
had
a
mountain
to
climb
but
we
have
climbed
it
and
credit
to
everyone
that
was
one
of
the
best
goals
i
have
scored
i
caught
it
sweet
i
havent
caught
one
like
that
for
ages
it
was
a
massive
night
for
me
and
the
team
liverpools
win
means
all
four
of
englands
champions
league
representatives
have
reached
the
knockout
stages
for
the
first
time
