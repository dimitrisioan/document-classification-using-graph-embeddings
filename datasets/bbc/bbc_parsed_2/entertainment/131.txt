however
government
better
things
spend

give
charity
everyone
decides
theyre
musician
government
shouldnt
fund
music
invest
music
investments
treated
like
investment
think
government
needs
provide
facilities
young
groups
bands
form
practise

cheap
well
beyond
means
many
people
however
feel
extent
role
provide
conditions
talent
flourish
let
go
agree
government
help
fund
music
also
responsibility
held
record
companies
generally
always
opt
tried
tested
tend
want
break
moulds
risk
losing
money
ultimately
directors
business
labels
willing
put
money
forward
towards
smaller
breakthrough
acts
government
wouldnt
fork
great
deal
