new
busi
ha
been
attract
but
not
enough

the
differ
that

one
reason
whi
peopl
here
are
not
great
fan
of
the
eu
say
freder
sawicki
a
polit
lectur
at
the
univers
of
lill
in
the
region
today
the
unemploy
rate
is
in
some
area
it
is
they
dont
see
what
europ
is
do
for
them
so
there
is
a
kind
of
euro
sceptic
especi
in
the
work
class
he
say
which
is
strang
becaus
lill
is
at
the
crossroad
of
europ
if
anywher
should
be
benefit
from
the
euro
it
is
here
the
euro
wa
design
to
increas
trade
within
the
eurozon
but
the
biggest
increas
in
trade
ha
been
with
the
rest
of
the
world
much
of
that
trade
pas
through
the

closer
bos
henk
addink
blame
the
low
growth
rate
in
europ
for
the
lack
of
order
closer
to
home
in
the
u
growth
is
someth
like
in
china
they
are
estim
and
in
the
eu
it
is
more
or
le
he
say
mr
addink
blame
the
euro
for
stifl
demand
he
much
prefer
the
old
currenc
of
europ
which
move
in
relat
to
each
countri
econom
perform
in
germani
industri
is
export
more
these
day
but
the
economi
a
a
whole
is
onc
again
mire
in
slow
growth
and
high
unemploy
growth
is
like
to
peak
thi
year
at
just
under
in
britain
that
would
be
a
bad
year
in
germani
it
is
one
of
the
best
in
recent
year
with
germani
make
up
a
third
of
the
eurozon
economi
thi
is
a
major
problem
if
germani
doesnt
onc
again
becom
the
powerhous
of
europ
growth
across
the
bloc
is
never
go
to
be
a
strong
a
it
could
be
howev
at
one
factori
near
the
dutch
border
thing
are
chang
the
siemen
plant
at
boscholt
make
cordless
phone
and
employ
staff
staff
have
start
work
an
extra
four
hour
a
week
for
no
extra
pay
after
siemen
threaten
to
take
the
factori
and
their
job
to
hungari
factori
manag
herbert
stueker
say
that
he
now
hope
to
increas
product
by
nearli
but
germani
need
much
more
reform
if
all
it
industri
is
to
compet
with
place
such
hungari
or
china
the
govern
is
reform
the
labour
market
and
cut
the
gener
unemploy
system
but
the
real
solut
is
to
cut
the
wage
of
low
skill
worker
say
helmut
schneider
director
of
the
institut
for
the
studi
of
labour
at
bonn
univers
labour
is
too
costli
in
germani
especi
for
the
low
skill
labour
and
thi
is
the
main
problem
if
we
could
solv
that
problem
we
could
cut
unemploy
by
half
he
say
the
eu
set
itself
the
target
of
be
the
most
effici
economi
in
the
world
by
four
year
into
that
process
and
the
target
seem
further
away
than
ever
