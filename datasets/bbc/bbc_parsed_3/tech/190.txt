some

soni
playstat
have
been
reveal
soni
ibm
and
toshiba
have
releas
limit
data
about
the
socal
cell
chip
that
will
be
abl
to
carri

the

will
be
made
of
sever

core
that
work
on

togeth
the
playstat
is
expect
in
but
develop
are
expect
to
get
prototyp
earli
next
year
to
tune
game
that
will
appear
on
it
at
launch
the
three
firm
have
been
work
on
the
chip
sinc
but
befor
now
few
detail
have
been
releas
about
how
it
might
function
in
a
joint
statement
the
three
firm
gave
hint
about
how
the
chip
will
work
but
fuller
detail
will
be
releas
in
februari
next
year
at
the
intern
solid
state
circuit
confer
in
san
francisco
the
three
firm
claim
that
the
cell
chip
will
be
up
to

more
power
than

when
put

the
cell
consortium
expect
it
to
be
capabl
of
handl
trillion

the

ha
also
been

a
