dr

so
he
is
wellplac
to
take
on
such
a

the
net
growth
and
evolut
depend
on
standard
and
protocol
and
ensur
the
architectur
work
and
talk
to
other
standard
is
a
crucial
job
of
the
ietf
the
top
prioriti
is
to
ensur
that
the
standard
that
make
the
net
work
are
open
and
free
for
anyon
to
use
and
work
with
the
net
is
built
on
a
protocol
call
tcpip
which
mean
transmiss
control
protocol
and
internet
protocol
when
comput
commun
with
the
net
a
uniqu
ip
address
is
use
to
send
and
receiv
inform
the
ietf
is
a
larg
intern
commun
of
network
design
oper
vendor
and
research
work
on
the
evolut
of
the
net
architectur
and
the
way
thi
inform
is
sent
and
receiv
they
make
sure
it
all
knit
togeth
leav
no
gap
weve
seen
some
interest
effect
over
last
few
year
explain
dr
carpent
the
net
wa
grow
at
a
fantast
rate
at
the
end
of
the
s
then
there
wa
a
bit
of
a
glitch
in
we
are
now
see
a
veri
clear
phase
of
consolid
and
renew
growth
that
renew
growth
is
also
be
buoy
by
emerg
economi
like
china
which
are
show
fast
uptak
of
broadband
net
and
other
technolog
the
number
of
broadband
subscrib
via
dsl
digit
subscrib
line
doubl
in
a
year
to
million
accord
to
figur
releas
at
the
end
of
the
challeng
we
face
are
about
continu
to
produc
standard
to
allow
for
that
growth
rate
explain
dr
carpent
given
it
the
net
wa
design
for
the
whole
commun
it
ha
done
well
to
reach
million
if
you
want
to
reach
the
whole
popul
you
have
to
make
sure
it
can
scale
up
ipv
the
standard
that
will
replac
the
exist
ipv
will
allow
for
billion
more
address
on
the
net
and
it
is
gradual
be
work
into
network
infrastructur
across
the
world
the
actual
number
of
address
with
ipv
is
limit
to
four
billion
ip
address
that
clearli
is
not
enough
when
you
have
billion
peopl
to
serv
so
there
is
technic
solut
the
new
version
of
ip
ipv
it
ha
much
larger
address
space
possibl
with
no
practic
limit
said
dr
carpent
standard
are
vital
to
someth
a
complex
a
the
net
and
make
sure
standard
are
open
and
can
work
with
across
network
is
a
big
task
the
differ
thi
next
gener
standard
ipv
will
make
to
the
averag
net
user
is
almost
invis
our
first
goal
is
that
it
ipv
should
make
no
differ
peopl
should
not
notic
a
differ
it
is
like
when
the
london
telephon
number
got
longer
a
lot
of
the
process
will
be
invis
peopl
are
usual
given
an
ip
address
without
know
it
technic
deploy
ha
start
and
the
standard
for
are
just
about
settl
said
dr
carpent
the
one
problem
with
the
net
that
may
never
disappear
complet
is
secur
to
dr
carpent
the
solut
come
out
of
technolog
and
human
behaviour
peopl
have
to
be
educ
about
sensibl
behaviour
he
say
such
a
ignor
email
that
claim
you
have
won
someth
i
dont
think
it
is
go
to
get
wors
peopl
will
remain
concern
about
secur
and
they
probabl
should
do
just
a
you
would
be
concern
walk
along
a
dark
street
we
have
to
do
work
to
make
sure
there
are
better
secur
internet
standard
it
is
a
neverend
battl
in
a
sens
but
he
add
even
if
secur
ha
improv
you
still
worri
a
bit
unfortun
it
is
just
part
of
life
we
have
a
duti
to
do
what
we
can
