be
use
by
anyon
without
commerci
restraint
and
a
farflung
network
of
talent
to
creat
a
system
that
link
those
in
need
with
those
who
can
help
thi
is
a
classic
smart
mob
situat
where
you
have
peopl
selforgan
into
a
larger
enterpris
to
do
thing
that
benefit
other
peopl
say
paul
saffo
a
director
at
the
californiabas
institut
for
the
futur
you
may
be
halfway
around
the
world
from

your
just
one
click
or
one
email
away
he
said
that
put
a
whole
new
dimens
on
disast
relief
and
recoveri
where
often
peopl
halfway
around
the
world
can
be
more
effect
in
make
someth
happen
precis
becaus
theyr
not
right
on
top
of
the
tragedi
it
is
still
veri
earli
day
for
the
project
though
in
an
email
dan
lane
call
it
an
earli
proof
of
concept
right
now
the
alert
retriev
cach
can
onli
take
a
text
messag
and
automat
upload
it
to
a
webpag
or
distribut
it
to
an
email
list
in
the
near
futur
the
group
say
it
hope
to
take
in
messag
from
peopl
in
affect
area
and
use
human
moder
to
take
action
base
on
the
content
of
those
messag
but
there
still
anoth
challeng
you
have
to
get
peopl
to
know
that
the
system
is
there
for
them
to
use
it
amaz
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
someon
to
pas
it
along
to
and
say
look
thi
is
what
were
tri
to
do
and
everyth
like
that
say
mr
rampersad
so
the
big
problem
right
now
is
the
same
problem
were
tri
to
solv
human
commun
he
is
optimist
howev
he
think
that
the
alert
retriev
cach
is
an
idea
whose
time
ha
come
and
he
hope
govern
too
will
sit
up
and
take
notic
and
he
