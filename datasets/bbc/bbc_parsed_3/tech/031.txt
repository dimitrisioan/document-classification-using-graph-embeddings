steve

from

told
the
bbc

websit
there
are
two
part
to
the
process
of

the
most
difficult
is
to
ascertain
whether
an

is
who
they
say
they
are
when
they
are

the
end
solut
is
to
provid
a

where
you
combin
someth
the
user
know
with
someth
they
have
and
present
those
both
the
method

it
combin
that
with

a

a
other
secur
question
you
take
the
card
put
it
in
the
reader
enter
your
pin
number
and
a

is
given
if
you
want
then
to
transfer
fund
for

you
would
have
to
have
the

to
authoris
the
transact
the
clever
bit
happen
back
at
the
bank
secur
server
the
code
is
valid
by
the
bank
system
match
the
inform
they
expect
with
the
custom
uniqu
key
each
individu
get
a
key
which
is
uniqu
to
them
it
is
a
bit
long
number
that
is
virtual
imposs
to
crack
said
mr
ash
it
mean
that
in
a
typic
secur
attack
explain
mr
ash
even
if
password
inform
is
captur
by
a

use
keystrok
softwar
or
just
through
spoof
websit
they
need
the

by

they
go

the

ha
expir
so
they
cant
prove
who
they

to
mr
ash
in

mr
ash
predict
that
thi
kind

will
be
commonplac
befor
we
see
