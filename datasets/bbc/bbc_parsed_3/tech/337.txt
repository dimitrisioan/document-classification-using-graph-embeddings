of
the

both
began
life
a
search
engin
although
in
when

yahoo
wa
busi
build
a
portal
and
while
it
wa
good
to
diversifi
they
made
a
big
mistak
in
outsourc
search
to
googl
he
said
they
thought
googl
would
just
be
a
technolog
provid
but
it
ha
becom
a
portal
in
it
own
right
and
a
direct
competitor
he
ad
he
believ
yahoo
fail
to
see
how
crucial
search
would
becom
to
internet
user
someth
it
ha
rediscov
in
recent

it
is
interest
that
in
these
last

year
it
ha
refocus
on

follow
the
success
of

director
at

firm
gartner
and
someon
who
ha
follow
yahoo
progress
sinc
the
earli
year
the
futur
of
search
is
not
go
to
be
pure
about
the
technolog
power
it
search
technolog
is
valuabl
but
the
next
gener
of
search
is
go
to
be
about
premium
content
and
the
interfac
that
user
have
to
that
content
he
said
he
believ
the
rivalri
between
googl
and
yahoo
is
overblown
and
instead
think
the
real
battl
is
go
to
be
between
yahoo
and
msn
it
is
a
battl
that
yahoo
is
current
win
he
believ
microsoft
ha
amaz
asset
includ
softwar
capabl
and
a
global
name
but
it
ha
yet
to
show
me
it
can
creat
a
rival
product
to
yahoo
he
said
he
is
convinc
yahoo
remain
the
singl
most
import
brand
on
the
world
wide
web
i
believ
yahoo
is
the
semin
brand
on
the

if
you
are
look
for
a
text
book
definit
of

portal
then
yahoo
is
it
he
said
it
ha
achiev
thi
domin
mr

believ
by
a
canni
combin
of
acquisit
such
a
that
of
inktomi
and
overtur
and
by
avoid
direct
involv
in
either
content
creation
or

access
that
is
not
to
say
that
yahoo
hasnt
had
it
dark
day
when
the
dotcom
bubbl
burst
it
lost
onethird
of
it
