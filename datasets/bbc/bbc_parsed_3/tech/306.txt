what
thi

is
realli
adopt
by

explain
dr
tuffi
but
gamer
are
also
the
ideal
target
audienc
for
hd
becaus
they
alway
crave
better
qualiti
graphic
and
more
immers
game
experi
they
are
use
to
spend
money
on
hardwar
to
match
a
game
requir
demograph
have
chang
too
and
the
sweet
spot
for
the
game
industri
is
the
gamer
in
hi
or
her
late
s
thi
mean
they
are
like
to
have
higher
dispos
incom
and
can
afford
the
price
of
bigscreen
highdefinit
display
technolog
and
hd
projector
earlier
than
other
higher
capac
storag
disc
such
a
hddvd
and
blueray
are
set
to
be
standard
in
the
next
round
of
game
consol
allow
develop
more
room
for
detail
graphic
for
consol
develop
though
hd
offer
some
product
chang
it
could
make
game
product
slightli
more
expens
think
dr
tuffi
but
we
may
see
the
crossplatform
develop
of
game
becom
more
common
becaus
they
will
more
easili
be
abl
to
take
a
pc
game
and
appli
it
to
a
consol
he
say
you
are
liter
go
to
get
to
the
point
with
a
lord
of
the
ring
game
for
exampl
is
go
to
be
closer
and
closer
to
the
actual
film
especi
the
cgi
stuff
from
the
dvd
and
the
transit
when
they
move
from
a
cut
scene
to
the
game
just
now
they
have
almost
got
it
seamless
with
hd
he
say
the
transit
will
be
complet
seamless
and
the
same
qualiti
a
the
bigscreen
cinema
releas
thi
could
herald
an
increas
converg
between
the
film
and
game
industri
but
it
may
not
be
until
the
gener
after
the
next
game
consol
where
the
two
industri
realli
collid
at
that
point
say
dr
tuffi
game
could
becom
more
or
