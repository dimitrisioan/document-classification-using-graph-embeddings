been
a
frustrat
for

a

found
that
the
short

wa
the
most

said

chief
mobil

evangelist
for

giant
intel
for
most
of
the

batteri

wa
stuck
on
two
to

but
now
he
said
laptop
can
last
much
longer
it
wa
not
just
a
case
of

by
squeez
more

he
explain
other

he

the

ha
done
a
great

said
mr
trainor
though
work
still
need
to
be
done
to
get
them
success
from
the
lab
to
manufactur
he
wa
sceptic
that
fuel
cell
would
develop
quick
enough
to
take
over
from
solid

even
though
they
have
the
potenti
to
produc

more

you
need
