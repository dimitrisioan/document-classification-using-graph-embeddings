onlin
commun
set
up
by
the

govern
could
encourag
public
debat
and
build
trust
say
the

of
public
polici
research
ippr
exist
servic
such
a
ebay
could
provid
a
good
blueprint
for
such
servic
say
the
thinktank
although
the
net
is
becom
part
of
local
and
central
govern
it
potenti
ha
not
yet
been
fulli
exploit
to
creat
an
onlin
common
for
public
debat
in
it
report
is
onlin
commun
a
polici
tool
the
ippr
also
ask
if
id
card
could
help
creat
safer
onlin
commun
adopt
an
ebaytyp
model
would
let
commun
creat
their
own
market
for
skill
and
servic
and
help
foster
a
sens
of
local
ident
and
connect
what
we
are
propos
is
a
civic
common
will
davi
senior
research
fellow
at
the
ippr
told
the
bbc
news
websit
a
singl
publicli
fund
and
run
onlin
commun
in
which
citizen
can
have
a
singl
place
to
go
where
you
can
go
to
engag
in
divers
and
in
a
way
that
might
have

the
idea
of
a
civic

wa

propos
by
stephen
coleman
professor
of
edemocraci
at
the
oxford
internet
institut
the
ippr
report
point
to
inform
small
scale
exampl
of
such

that
alreadi
exist
it
mention
goodpractic
public
initi
like
the
bbc
ican
project
which
connect
peopl
local
and
nation
who
want
to
take
action
around
import
issu
but
he
add
govern
could
play
a
bigger
role
in
set
up
system
of
trust
for
onlin
commun
too
propos
for
id
card
for
instanc
could
also
be
widen
to
see
if
they
could
be

onlin
they
could
provid
the
basi
for
a
secur
authent
system
which
could
have
valu
for
peertop
interact
onlin
at
the
moment
they
have
been
present
a
a
way
for
govern
to
keep
tab
on
peopl
and
ensur
access
to
public
servic
said
mr
davi
but
what
ha
not
been
explor
is
how
authent
technolog
may
potenti
play
a
role
in
decentralis
onlin
commun
the
key
idea
to
take
from
system
such
a
ebay
and
other
onlin
commun
is
let
member
rate
each
other
reput
by
how
they
treat
other
member
use
a
similar
mechan
trust
and
cooper
between
member
of
virtual
and
physic
commun
could
be
built
thi
could
mean
a
civic
common
would
work
within
a
nonmarket
system
which
let
peopl
who
may
disagre
with
one
anoth
interact
within

egovern
initi
over
the
last
decad
have
veri
much
been
about
put
basic
inform
and
servic
guid
onlin
a
well
a
let
peopl
interact
with
govern
via
the
web
mani
onlin
commun
such
a
chatroom
mail
list
commun
portal
messag
board
and
weblog
often
form
around
common
interest
or
issu
with
of
uk
household
now
with
access
to
the
net
the
govern
suggest
mr
davi
could
act
a
an
intermediari
or
middleman
to
set
up
public
onlin
place
of
debat
and
exchang
to
encourag
more
cosmopolitan
polit
and
public
trust
in
polici
govern
alreadi
play
a
critic
role
in
help
citizen
trade
with
each

onlin
but
it
should
also
play
a
role
in
help
citizen
connect
to
one
anoth
in
civic
nonmarket
interact
said
mr
davi
there
is
a
role
for
public
bodi
like
the
bbc
librari
and
govern
to
bring
peopl
back
into
public
debat
again
instead
of
million
of
cliqu
talk
to
each
