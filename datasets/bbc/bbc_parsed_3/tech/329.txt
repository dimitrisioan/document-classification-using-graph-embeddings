scientist
at

have
overcom
a
fundament
problem
that
befor

be
use

the
breakthrough
should
make
it
easier
to
interconnect

exploit
the
breakthrough
should
appear
by
the
end
of
the
decad
weve
overcom
a

said
dr
mario
paniccia
director
of
intel
photon
technolog
lab
write
in
the
journal
natur
dr
paniccia
and
colleagu
haisheng
rong
richard
jone
ansheng
liu
ode
cohen
dani
hak
and
alexand
fang
show
how
they
have
made
a
continu
laser
from
the
same
materi
use
to
make
comput
processor
current
say
dr
paniccia
telecommun
equip
that
amplifi
the
laser
light
that
travel
down
fibr
optic
cabl
is
veri
expens
becaus
of
the
exot
materi
such
a
gallium
arsenid
use
to
make
it
telecommun
firm
and
chip
maker
would
prefer
to
use
silicon
for
these
lightmov
element
becaus
it
is
cheap
and
mani
of
the
problem
of
use
it
in
highvolum
manufactur
have
been
solv
were
tri
to
take
our
silicon
compet
in
manufactur
and
appli
it
to
new
area
said
dr
paniccia
while
work
ha
been
done
to
make
some
of
the
compon
that
can
move
light
around
befor
now
silicon
ha
not
success
been
use
to
gener
or
amplifi
the
laser
light
pul
use
to
send
data
over
long
distanc
thi
is
despit
the
fact
that
silicon
is
a
much
better
amplifi
of
light
pul
than
the
form
of
the
materi
use
in
fibr
optic
cabl
thi
improv
amplif
is
due
to
the
crystallin
structur
of
the
silicon
use
to
make
comput
chip
dr
paniccia
said
that
the
structur
of
silicon
meant
that
when
laser
light
pas
through
it
some
collid
photon
rip
electron
off
the
atom
within
the
materi
it
creat
a
cloud
of
electron
sit
in
the
silicon
and
that
absorb
all
the
light
he
said
but
the
intel
research
have
found
a
way
to
suck
away
these
errant
electron
and
turn
silicon
into
a
materi
that
can
both
gener
and
amplifi
laser
light
even
better
the
laser
light
produc
in
thi
way
can
with
the
help
of
easytomak
filter
be
tune
across
a
veri
wide
rang
of
frequenc
semiconductor
laser
made
befor
now
have
onli
produc
light
in
a
narrow
frequenc
rang
the
result
could
be
the
close
integr
of
the
fibr
optic
cabl
that
carri
data
a
light
with
the
comput
chip
that
process
it
dr
paniccia
said
the
work
wa
the
one
of
sever
step
need
if
silicon
wa
to
be
use
to
make
compon
that
could
carri
and
process
light
in
the
form
of
data
pul
it
a
technic
valid
that
it
can
work
