said
mr

iptv
is
about
more
than
telco
though
there
are
sever
webbas
offer
that
aim
to
put

power
jeremi
allair
chief
of
brightcov
told
the
bbc
news
websit
that
it
would
be
a
flavour
of
iptv
that
wa
about
har
the
web
a
a
channel
it
is
not
just
nich
but
about
exploit
content
not
usual
view
he
said
we
are
focus
on
the
owner
of
video
content
who
have
right
to
digit
distribut
content
and
who
often
see
unencumb
distribut
for
them
to
do
it
through
cabl
and
so
on
is
priceprohibit
he
said
thi
type
of
iptv
servic
might
also
be
a
distribut
channel
for
more
establish
publish
who
have
uniqu
type
of
content
that
they
can
not
offer
through
cabl
and
satellit
oper
histori
channel
archiv
for
instanc
what
is
a
clear
sign
that
iptv
ha
a
futur
is
that
microsoft
is
not
the
onli
player
in
the
field
there
are
a
lot
of
other
middlewar
player
provid
similar
manag
servic
a
microsoft
like
myrio
and
ccor
but
it
will
up
to
the
viewer
to
decid
if
it
realli
is
to
be
success
