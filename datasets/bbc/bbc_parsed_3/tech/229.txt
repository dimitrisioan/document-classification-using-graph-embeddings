a
alway
with

it

have
been
the

japan
seem
to
have

with
a

popul

the

seem
to
repres
a
new
line
of
futur

that
meet
an
individu
particular
mobil
need
while
toyota
prototyp
are
gear
toward

the
compani
say
that
the

will
allow

the

expert
though
are
a
bit
sceptic
of
their
accept
in
thi
area
those
with
arguabl
the
greatest
need
for
thi
sort
of
assist
now
and
certainli
in

futur
are
the
elderli

infirm
peopl
dr
gillingwat
told
the

you
have
to
ask
whether

said
the
design
of

mobil
devic
is
not
complet
adjust
to
the
specif
need
of
the
elderli
and
the
disabl
for
exampl
one
problem
that
mani
older
passeng
experi
is
limit
abil
to
rotat
the
neck
and
upper
bodi
make
it
difficult
to
look
to
the
side
and
back
when
back
up
it
look
like
the
visual
design
of
the
devic
interior
doe
not
consid
thi
need
thi
and
other
humanfactor
relat

in
the
design
of
such

not
the

that
should
be

user
might
not

accept
such
innov
thi
may
be
anoth
barrier
to
the
commerci
success
of
such
a

such
singleperson

may
find
a
rel
small

nich
and
may
be
more
suit
toward
specialis
applic
rather
than
revolutionis
the
face
of
mass
transport
the
concept
of
person
mobil
behind
these
sort
of
innov
is
great
but
they
beg
a
huge
number
of
question
said
dr
gillingwat
what
their
rang
how

will
they
realli
be
what
infrastructur
will

requir
to
