if
it
get

the

will
leav
million
of

possibl
of

case
against
them
if
the

wa
about

our

over

sadli
for
those
who
will
be

affect
the
controversi
concern
the

of

program
a
topic
that
may
excit
the
blogger
campaign
group
and

but
doe
not
ob
middl

after
all
how
much
fuss
can
you
gener
about
the
direct
on
the
patent
of
computerimpl
invent
and
the
way
it
amend
articl
of
the
european
patent
convent
yet
if
the
new
direct
is
nod
through
at
the
next
meet
of
one
of
the
eu
ministeri
council
a
seem
like
it
will
allow
program
to
be
patent
in
europ
just
a
they
are
in
the
u
mani
observ
of
the
comput
scene
includ
myself
think
the
result
will
be
disastr
for
small
compani
innov
programm
and
the
free
and
open
sourc
softwar
movement
it
will
let
larg
compani
patent
all
sort
of
idea
and
give
legal
forc
to
those
who
want
to
limit
their
competitor
use
of
realli
obviou
idea
in
the
u
you
can
not
build
a
system
that
store
custom
credit
card
detail
so
that
they
can
pay
without
have
to
reenter
them
unless
amazon
let
you
becaus
they
hold
the
patent
on
oneclick
onlin
purchas
it
is
a
small
invent
but
amazon
made
it
to
the
patent
offic
first
and
now
own
it
we
are
rel
free
from
thi
sort
of
thing
over
here
but
perhap
not
for
long
the
new
propos
go
back
to
although
argument
about
patent
of
softwar
and
computerimpl
invent
ha
been
go
on
sinc
at
least
the
mid
they
have
come
to
a
head
now
after
a
year
in
which
propos
were
made
endors
by
the
council
of
minist
radic
modifi
by
the
european
parliament
and
then
repres
in
their
origin
form
some
nation
govern
seem
to
be
awar
of
the
problem
poland
ha
reject
the
propos
and
germani
main
polit
parti
have
oppos
it
but
there
is
not
enough
opposit
to
guarante
their
reject
earli
in
decemb
the
british
govern
held
a
consult
meet
with
those
who
had
comment
on
the
propos
scienc
minist
lord
sainsburi
went
along
to
listen
and
outlin
the
uk
posit
but
accord
to
those
present
it
wa
embarrass
to
see
how
littl
the
minist
and
hi
offici
actual
understood
the
issu
concern
the
draft
direct
is
be
put
through
the
council
a
what
is
call
an
a
item
and
can
onli
be
approv
or
reject
no
discus
or
amend
is
allow
so
whi
should
we
be
worri
first
there
is
the
abus
of
the
democrat
process
involv
in
disregard
the
view
of
the
parliament
and
abandon
all
of
their
care
argu
amend
thi
goe
to
the
heart
of
the
european
project
and
even
those
who
do
not
care
about
softwar
or
patent
should
be
worri
if
coder
are
treat
like
thi
today
who
is
to
say
that
it
will
not
be
you
tomorrow
more
directli
onc
softwar
patent
are
grant
then
ani
programm
will
have
to
worri
that
the
code
they
are
write
is
infring
someon
el
patent
thi
is
not
about
steal
softwar
a
code
is
alreadi
protect
by
copyright
patent
are
not
copyright
but
someth
much
stronger
a
patent
give
the
owner
the
right
to
stop
anyon
el
use
their

even
if
the
other

if
it

that
one

i
could

it

the

it

then
i

at

in
the
u
coincid
is
no
defenc
the
propos
direct
is
support
by

of
the
major
softwar
compani
but
thi
is
hardli
surpris
sinc
most
of

are
usbas
and
they
have
alreadi
had
to
cope
with
a
legal
environ
that
allow

they
have
legal
depart
and
more
crucial
patent
of
their
own
which
they
can
trade
or
crosslicens
with
other
patent
holder
even
thi
system
break
down
of

a
microsoft
found
out
last

when
they
initi
lost
a

brought
by

patent
that
one
wa
eventu
thrown
out
but
onli
after
month
of
uncertainti
and
million
of

but
small
compani
and
the
free

open
softwar

do
not
have

much
of
