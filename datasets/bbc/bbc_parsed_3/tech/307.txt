think
it
about
time
my
first
car
ran
on
four
star
petrol
and
pump
vast
quantiti
of
lead
into
the
atmospher
a
i
drove
around
cambridg
now
you
cant
buy
petrol
with
lead
addit
and
were
all
better

began
ship

that
are
lead
free
too
reflect
a
grow
awar
on
the
part
of
the
technolog
industri
that
product
have
to
be
design
and
built
in
more
environment
friendli
way
apart
from
reduc
the
use
of
toxic
materi
like
arsen
mercuri
cadmium
and
other
heavi
metal
in
the
product
themselv
the
manufactur
process
is
also

charg

one
of
the
key
aspect
of
the
new
approach
is
to
design
product
that
are
easier
to
recycl
if
you
have
got
a
phone
or
a
comput
with
toxic
chemic
or
heavi
metal
in
it
then
extract
them
can

they
will
end

pay
if
they
build
thing
that
are
expens

imposs

and
will
find

someth
which
is
like
to
motiv
them
where
appeal
to
the
wider
public
interest
might
fall
on

it
is
a
they
say
about
time
we
have
a
long

depress
histori
of

complet
disregard
for

more

so
it

befor

were
see
the

thing
in

and
a
a
result
there
are
billion
of
devic
from
old
mobil
phone
to
antiqu
handheld
that
will
have
to
be
recycl
in

to
come
if
appl
get

then
a

of
peopl
are
go
to
be
buy
a
new
mac
mini
and
throw
away
their
old
pc
keep
the
monitor
and
other
peripher
even
if
appl
doe
not
get
it
way
four
or
fiveyearold
comput
are
not
good
enough
to
run
modern
program
and
it
not
unreason
to
replac
them
but
what
do
we
do
with
the
old
one
ive
just
look
around
my
offic
and
i
find
two
monitor
an
old
pc
two
old
handheld
three
ancient
laptop
four
antiqu
mobil
phone
a
collect
of
recharg
batteri
and
even
a
sun
workstat
that
is
no
longer
realli
much
use
they
are
all
old
enough
to
be
hazard
wast
the
monitor
alon
will
be
full
of
arsen
and
lead
but
it
possibl
that
some
of
the
compon
could
be
use
i
could
take
them
up
the
to
the
council
recycl
centr
but
it
a
mile
drive
away
across
town
and
like
mani
other
peopl
my
commit
to
recycl
is
shallow
at
best
here
in
cambridg
we
have
green
bin
for
compost
wast
a
box
for
glass
can
and
paper
that
can
be
recycl
and
a
black
bin
for
the
rest
there
are
bottl
bank
and
cloth
bank
scatter
around
town
and
in
supermarket
car
park
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
for
an
electron
recycl
box
too
id
probabl
rememb
to
take
my
old
mobil
with
me
to
the
supermarket

drop
