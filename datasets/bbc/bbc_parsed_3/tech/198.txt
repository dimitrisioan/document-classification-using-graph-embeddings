futur
and
it
is
in
hi
son
hand
i
bought
my
son
max
a
g
phone
partli
becaus
they
are
so
cheap
and
he
need
a
phone
and
partli
becaus
i
am
suppos
to
know
about
the
latest
technolog
and
thought
i
should
see
how
they
work
in
real
life
after
use
it
for
a
while
i
am
not
at
all
tempt
to
get
rid
of
my
sonyericsson
p
smart
phone
that
ha
a
rel
larg
screen
even
if
it
doe

have
slower
gpr
access
to
the
network
i
can
read
my
email
surf
the
web
use
a
proper
browser
and
write
stuff
use
the
stylu
on
it
touch
screen
last
week
someon
email
me
a
document
that
had
been
compress
into
a
zip
file
and
i
wa
pleasantli
surpris
to
discov
that
my
phone
even
knew
how
to
decompress
it
for
me
by
contrast
the
confus
menu
complic
keyboard
and
truli
irrit
user
interfac
of
max
g
phone
simpli
get
in
the
way
and
i
did
not
see
much
valu
in
the
paidfor
servic
especi
the
limit
web
access
the
video
of
entertain
news
horoscop
and
the
latest
celebr
gossip
did
not
appeal
and
i
did
not
see
how
the
small
screen
could
be
use
for
ani
sort
of
imag
never
mind
microtv
but
then
max
start
play
and
i
realis
i
wa
miss
the
point
entir
it
is
certainli
not
a
great
overal
experi
but
that
is
larg
due
to
the
poor
menu
system
and
the
phone
layout
the
video
content
itself
is
compel
the
qualiti
wa
at
least
a
good
a
the
video
stream
from
the
bbc
websit
and
the
imag
is
about
the
same
size
max
wa
complet
captiv
and
i
wa
intrigu
to
discov
that
i
had
nearli
miss
the
next
stage
of
the
network
revolut
it
is
easi
to
be
dismiss
of
small
screen
and
inde
anyon
of
my
gener
with
fail
eyesight
and
the
view
that
there
never
anyth
worth
watch
on
tv
is
hardli
go
to
embrac
these
phone
but
just
a

plea
the

for
some

but
it
goe
deeper
than
that
play

on
a

mark
the
begin
of
a
move
away
from
the
download
and
play
model
we
have
all
accept
for
our
ipod
and
mp

after
all
whi
should
i
want
to
carri
gb
of
music
and
pictur
around
with
me
in
my

when
i
can
simpli
listen
to
anyth
i
want

i
want

oh
and
of
cours
you
can
alway
use
the
phone
to
make
voic
call
and
send
text
someth
which
ensur
that
it
is
alway
in
someon
pocket
or
handbag
avail
for
other
use
too
i
have
never
realli
approv
of
use
the
internet
protocol
ip
to
do
either
audio
or
video
stream
and
i
think
that
technic
it
is
a
disast
to
make
phone
call
over
the
net
use
voic
over
ip
but
i
have
to
acknowledg
that
the
net
at
least
here
in
the
develop
western
countri
is
fast
and
reliabl
enough
to
do
both
i
stream
radio
to
my
comput
while
i
work
and
enjoy
hear
the
bizarr
station
from
around
the
world
that
i
can
find
onlin
but
nowher
el
i
am
even
play
with
internet
telephoni
despit
my
reserv
and
i
appear
on
go
digit
on
the
world
servic
stream
over
the
web
each
week
but
g
network
have
been
design
to
do
thi
sort
of
stream
both
for
voic
and
video
which
give
them
an
edg
over
netbas
ip
servic
the
g
servic
arent
quit
there
yet
and
there
is
a
lot
to
be
sort
out
when
it
come
to
web
access
and
data
charg
vodafon
will
let
you
access
it
servic
on
vodafon
live
a
part
of
your
subscript
cost
but
it
make
you
pay
by
the
megabyt
to
download
from
other
site
thi
one
for
exampl
thi
will
not
matter
to
busi
user
but
will
distort
the
consum
market
and
keep
peopl
within
the
phone
compani
collect
of
partner
site
someth
that
should
perhap
be
worri
telecom
regul
ofcom
but
we
should
not
see
these
new
phone
simpli
a
cutdown
network
termin
if
i
want
fast
access
to
my
email
i
can
get
a
g
card
for
my
laptop
or
hook
up
to
a
wireless

the

is
a
lot
more
and
it
is

there
is
certainli

access
a
wide
rang
of
servic
over
differ
network
g
phone
and
ipod
can
coexist
at
least
for
a
while
but
if
i
had
to
bet
on
the
long
term
i
would
go
for

on

over
