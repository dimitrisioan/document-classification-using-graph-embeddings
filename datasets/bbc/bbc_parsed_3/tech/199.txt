peopl
live
on

or
le
you
might
think
that
the
last
thing
on
their
mind
would
be
get
a
televis
set
or
a
comput
but
that
not
the
case
mani
peopl
in
the
develop
world
give
up
one
of
their
daili
meal
so
they
can
afford
to
buy
a
tv
and
now
an

think
he
come
up
with
a
way
to
give
them
cheap
access
to

carnegi
mellon
professor
raj
reddi
ha
spent
the
bulk
of
hi
profession
career
tri
to
find
way
to
make
technolog
access
to
poor
peopl
the
first
step
is
to
figur
out
whi
poor
peopl
would
want
a
person
comput
and
professor
reddi
think
he
ha
a
pretti
good
idea
of
whi
they
might
i
come
from
a
villag
say
prof
reddi
i
know
what
the
popul
is
like
mani
of
them
are
illiter
and
mani
of
them
have
other
concern
there
nobodi
will
use
it
for
the
convent
us
of
a
pc
word
process
and
powerpoint
he
said
so
it
clear
to
me
that
if
peopl
want
to
use
pc
in
a
villag
it
ha
to
usabl
by
illiter
peopl
and
it
must
be
primarili
for
entertain
educ
telemedicin
and
access
to
expert
advic
prof
reddi
also
think
that
tie
it
into
some
kind
of
aid
packag
wa
the
wrong
approach
after
all
he
ask
what
aid
group
could
possibl
give
expens
comput
to
million
le
fortun
indian
let
alon
the
billion
of
poor
peopl
around
the
world
instead
prof
reddi
decid
to
think
of
those
million
indian
a
a
potenti
market
the
problem
then
becom
one
of
make
the
product
compel
enough
it
must
be
so
compel
that
you
would
give
up
your
third
meal
in
order
to
have
thi
prof
reddi
say
peopl
do
thi
today
with
televis
set
if
you
go
to
india
and
mani
other
countri
they
will
first
go
get
a
televis
set
befor
they
worri
about
one
more
meal
whi
becaus
person
entertain
ha
becom
veri
import
thi
hatch
a
complet
new
idea
he
call
it
a
pctvt
a
person
comput
televis
and
telephon
all
in
one
that
run
on
a
normal
desktop
machin
liter
user
can
surf
through
the
applic
with
a
keyboard
and
mous
but
illiter
user
can
use
what
look
like
a
televis
remot
control
on
the
screen
pictur
not
word
design
applic
like
tv
voic
mail
and
video
email
thi
depend
on
graphic
video
and
audio
mean
that
a
comput
for
an
illiter
person
need
time
more
power
and
more
memori
than
one
for
a
phd
prassana
rambathla
one
of
prof
reddi
graduat
student
say
that
when
your
talk
illiter
your
talk
audio
and
video
and
that
demand
exponenti
high
bandwidth
it
cant
choke
at
ani
point
in
time
and
it
ha
to
withstand
anyth
no
matter
what
your
press
the
major
part
is
make
it
foolproof
veri
tough
so
that
it
never
break
he
say
the
carnegi
mellon
team
say
thi
project
is
onli
possibl
becaus
pc
are
now
so
much
cheaper
and
have
builtin
audio
and
video
hardwar
and
softwar
limit
trial
of
the
pctvt
are
due
to
start
thi
month
in
the
indian
state
of
andhra
pradesh
although
andhra
pradesh
ha
a
fairli
good
infrastructur
but
work
ha
to
be
done
to
ensur
reliabl
connect
to
the
net
prof
reddi
ha
team
up
with
eric
brewer
at
the
univers
of
california
at
berkeley
the
answer
say
prof
brewer
is
wifi
were
look
at
the
thing
youll
see
in
starbuck
or
mani
other
hotspot
he
say
were
do
a
lot
of
work
on
longdist
wireless
and
how
to
make
the
network
work
better
in
the
presenc
of
intermitt
when
the
power
go
up
and
down
and
the
link
go
up
and
down
and
the
comput
your
connect
to
just
get
turn
off
for
no
reason
prof
reddi
say
he
hope
to
leas
the
pctvt
for
about
a
month
and
think
indian
will
rent
the
unit
for
the
televis
and
dvd
capabl
reddi
say
he
can
then
introduc
the
pctvt
other
technolog
such
a
video
mail
for
exampl
a
farmer
could
use
the
pctvt
webcam
to
send
a
pictur
of
a
harm
insect
to
a
local
offici
who
could
send
back
a
propos
cours
of
action
to
the
farmer
prof
reddi
think
thi
kind
of
commun
is
the
real
payoff
the
underli
problem
he
say
is
how
you
can
increas
their
wealth
and
reduc
their
poverti
and
reduc
their
illiteraci
and
improv
their
health
care
and
what
im
postul
is
that
thi
is
the
technolog
that
will
enabl
them
if
i
didnt
have
it
it
would
be
an
uphil
battl
even
with
the
technolog
it
an
uphil
battl
but
i
have
a
tool
there
is
hope
i
can
reach
them
in
way
that
have
not
been
possibl
