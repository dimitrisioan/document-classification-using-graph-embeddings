a
question
of
trust
and
technolog
a
major
govern
depart
is
without
email
for
a
week
and
technolog
analyst
bill
thompson
want
to
know
what
happen
a
coupl
of
week
ago
i
wrote
about
how
my
girlfriend
had
suffer
when
her
cabl
modem
blew
up
and
she
wa
offlin
for
sever
day
it
seem
that
thousand
of
civil
servant
at
the
uk
depart
of
work
and
pension
went
through
the
same
thing
last
week
it
ha
emerg
that
the
intern
network
crash
in
a
particularli
horribl
way
depriv
staff
of
email
and
access
to
the
applic
softwar
they
use
to
calcul
peopl
benefit
and
pension
entitl
or
note
chang
in
person
circumst
senior
consult
from
ed
the
comput
firm
which
manag
the
system
and
microsoft
which
suppli
the
softwar
were
run
around
tri
to
figur
out
what
had
to
be
done
to
fix
it
all
while
staff
resort
to
phone
fax
and
probabl
carrier
pigeon
to
get
work
done
fortun
the
backoffic
system
which
actual
pay
peopl
their
money
were
still
work
so
onli
new
claim
and
updat
were
affect
done
properli
thi
is
bad
enough
for
those
affect
but
it
doe
mean
that
the
impact
is
not
devast
for
million
of
pension
i
am
sure
regular
reader
will
be
expect
one
of
my
usual
diatrib
against
poor
softwar
badli
specifi
system
and
inadequ
disast
recoveri
plan
although
the
full
stori
ha
not
yet
been
told
it
seem
that
the
problem
start
when
a
plan
to
upgrad
some
of
the
comput
from
window
to
window
xp
went
wrong
and
xp
code
wa
inadvert
copi
to
thousand
of
machin
across
the
network
thi
is
certainli
unfortun
but
i
have
a
lot
of
sympathi
for
the
network
manag
and
technolog
staff
involv
today
comput
network
are
larg
complex
and
occasion
fragil
the
interconnected
that
we
all
valu
also
give
u
a
degre
of
instabl
and
unpredict
that
we
can
not
design
out
of
the
system
it
is
the
network
equival
of
godel
theorem
ani
system
suffici
complex
to
be
use
is
also
abl
to
collaps
catastroph
so
i
will
reserv
judgment
on
the
technolog
aspect
until
we
all
know
what
actual
happen
and
whether
it
wa
a
consequ
of
softwar
failur
or
just
bad
luck
what
is
realli
disturb
and
can
not
be
excus
is
the
fact
that
it
took
four
day
for
news
of
thi
system
failur
to
leak
out
into
the
technic
press
it
is
without
a
doubt
a
major
stori
and
wa
the
second
or
third
lead
item
on
bbc
radio
s
today
programm
throughout
friday
morn
so
whi
did
not
the
prime
minist
offici
spokesman
mention
it
at
ani
lobbi
brief
befor
friday
whi
wa
not
the
pension
minist
in
parliament
to
make
an
emerg
statement
on
tuesday
when
it
wa
clear
that
there
wa
a
seriou
problem
if
there
had
been
an
outbreak
of
legionnair
diseas
in
the
air
condit
system
we
would
have
been
told
but
it
seem
that
major
technolog
problem
do
not
merit
the
same
treatment
while
ed
and
microsoft
will
no
doubt
be
look
for
technic
lesson
to
learn
from
their
week
of
pain
we
can
learn
some
polit
lesson
too
and
the
most
import
is
that
in
thi
digit
world
technolog
failur
are
matter
of
public
interest
not
someth
that
can
be
ignor
in
the
hope
that
nobodi
will
notic
care
or
understand
that
mean
we
need
a
full
report
on
what
went
wrong
and
what
wa
done
to
fix
it
it
would
be
unaccept
for
ani
of
the
parti
involv
to
hide
behind
commerci
confidenti
or
even
parliamentari
privileg
a
major
system
ha
evid
collaps
and
we
need
to
know
what
went
wrong
and
what
is
be
done
differ
anyth
le
is
a
betray
of
public
trust
