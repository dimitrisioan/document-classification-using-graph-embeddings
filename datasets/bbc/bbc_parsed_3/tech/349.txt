outsid
of

satellit
digit
cabl
and

it
is
all
part
of
the

digit
video
record
pvr
give
peopl
much
more
control
over

broadcast
see
iptv
and
pvr
a
both
a
a
threat
and
an
opportun
the
bbc
recognis
that
tv
over

is
a
realiti
and
aim
to
innov
with
it
said
rahul
chakkara
control
of
bbci
interact
tv
servic
the
imp
is
base
on
peertop
technolog
and
let
peopl
download
programm
the
bbc
own
the
right
to
for
up
to
seven
day
after
broadcast
iptv
enabl
u
to
take
back
that
programm
to
our
audienc
at
differ
time
said
mr
chakkara
so
we
can
tell
our
audienc
that
that
programm
they
paid
for
via
the
licenc
fee
they
can
access
it
ani
time
they
want
it
help
said
mr
burk
that
peopl
are
more
au
fait
with
term
like
digit
interact
now
that
digit
tv
reach
more
than
of
uk
home
accord
to
benoit
joli
from
broadband
telecom
firm
thale
of
europ
can
not
get
satellit
tv
or
digit
tv
they
could
get
iptv
though
analyst
say
that
iptv
will
account
for
of
the
digit
tv
market
in
europ
alon
by
the
end
of
the
decad
what
need
to
happen
now
agre
analyst
is
for
connect
speed
to
be
bump
up
to
handl
the
servic
mbp
connect
would
be
ideal
bt
doe
not
see
itself
a
a
broadcast
of
iptv
servic
rather
a
an
enabl
said
mr
burk
it
strategi
is
a
hybrid
approach
he
explain
where
overtheair
convent
broadcast
are
supplement
with
content
over
broadband
initi
appeal
to
nich
market
like
sport
fan
it
will
widen
out
but
iptv
could
be
use
for
homemonitor
pet
cam
localis
news
servic
and
local
author
tv
too
say
bt
it
even
suggest
that
it
could
target
those
household
in
the
uk
that
do
not
own
a
comput
of
the
countri
broadband
to
them
would
not
be
about
data
and
the
net
that
could
come
later
for
them
but
about
cheap
phone
call
and
more
choic
of
tv
programm
home
choic
alreadi
offer
hour
of
show
