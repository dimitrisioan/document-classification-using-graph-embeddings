the

mean
a
growth
in
the
number
of

when
my

doe
come

at

time
a
i
do
i
find
that
i
am
so
use

sleep
by

that
it
is
difficult
to
get
to

with

i
cant

while

is
absolut
no

doesnt

or
is
so
distract
that
i
get
a
ummm
ya
a
few
minut
after
i
ask
him
a
question
game
widow
ha
becom
a
comed
term
for
woman
who
have
been
shut
out
by
male
gamer
but
for
some
it
is
not
in
the
least
funni
anoth
correspond
wrote
i
believ
that
he
is
addict
to
the
onlin
game
and
that
is
the
caus
of
hi
depress
and
restless
and
some
of
them
are
even
sadder
today
our
son
wa
five
day
old
the
sad
truth
is
my
husband
spent
hour
today
play
hi
warcraft
game
he
did
not
interact
with
our
sweet
tini
babi
becaus
there
were
import
quest
wait
onlin
video
game
fan
often
complain
that
their
hobbi
is
misunderstood
or
marginalis
but
a
game
becom
ever
more
mainstream
and
game
ever
more
immers
there
will
be
no
hide
place
for
social
problem
i
wish
hour
a
week
wa
unusu
but
i
think
it
probabl
isnt
an
hour
stretch
isnt
that
surpris
ive
known
peopl
to
play
hour
at
a
stretch
i
know
of
peopl
who
are
spend
their
week
holiday
from
work
play
warcraft
i
know
of
peopl
who
would
play
evercrack
in
shiftswak
at
am
to
take
over
from
their
friend
and
resum
wait
for
an
item
they
need
to
appear
i
understand
that
the
key
sign
of
an
addict
is
if
you
alter
your
life
around
it
rather
than
fit
it
into
your
life
by
all
standard
mani
of
u
are
addict
so
is
the
solut
to
forc
ourselv
to
stop
playingor
do
we
just
need
to
make
real
life
a
bit
more
interest
sadli
with
all
the
talk
of
peopl
becom
obsess
with
game
i
find
myself
long
to
have
the
time
to
join
them
i
have
been
in
a
long
term
relationship
for
over
year
sinc
that
began
game
have
becom
more
and
more
complex
and
more
and
more
so
i
find
i
have
le
and
le
time
to
play
them
with
and
marriag
and
work
be
the
main
drag
on
my
time
i
think
the
line
between
play
a
game
a
lot
and
a
game
addict
is
realli
quit
distinct
i
play
game
a
lot
defin
over
hour
a
week
but
i
dont
go
miss
work
or
other
commit
in
order
to
play
game
i
have
about
a
year
ago
delet
everi
game

all
your
worri
sorround

well
pile

more
achiev
in
the
fake
one
despit
have
littl
monetari
valu
the
reward

encourag
offer

these
mmorpg
is
enough
to
hook

hour
daili
if
onli
busi
could
learn
to
leverag
that
veri
simpli
human
need
for
easili

for
the
mirag
of
the
ultim
obsess
behaviour

doe
not
consid
the
game

ani
more
than
for
exampl
an
obsess
automot
tinker
consid
their
car
to
be
human
if
mmorpg
have
a
uniqu
danger
in
term
of
encourag
obsess
behaviour
it
is
not
that
they
creat
an
absorb
virtual
world
but
rather
that
they
can
be
easili
access
the
problem
here
doe
not
lie
with
the
natur
of
game
but
with
the
natur
of
modern
hour
cultur
the
problem
with
these
so
call
mmorpg
is
that
you
can
never
realli
complet
them
there
alway
anoth

the
peopl
who
tend
to

on
about
about
the
problem
of
hardcor
game
seem
to
be
those
who
have
rare
allow
themselv
to
becom
immers
in
a
game
i
would
expect
their
perspect
to
chang
if
they
were
to
do
that
i
use
to
be
an
everquest
addict
while
i
wa
in
colleg
it
came
to
the
point
where
the
game
world
felt
more
real
than
the
real
one
i
fail
alot
of
my
cours
and
wa
abl
to
bare
graduat
i
wa
lucki
that
i
came
to
my
sen
when
i
did
other
were
le
fortun
and
drop
out
of
colleg
now
that
i
am
hold
a
job
i
avoid
onlin
rpg
like
the
plagu
when
i
wa
made
redund
i
told
my
partner
i
had
a
new
job
for
three
month
whilst
everi
day
i
play
everquest
from
am
till
pm
when
she
came
home
i
pretend
i
had
just
got
in
a
well
henc
justifi
play
it
all
even
i
have
sinc
quit
play
mmorpg
and
have
a
good
job
when
i
got
to
the
point
where
i
wa
eat
my
dinner
in
front
of
the
pc
i
realis
thing
were
get
silli
so
im
tri
not
to
spend
so
much
time
on
there
it
not
easi
i
feel
a
if
ive
got
a
real
addict
go
on
here
for
me
the
problem
is
that
i
love
to
complet
a
goal
onc
it
is
complet
that
is
it
i
am
finish
time
to
move
on
i
becom
obsess
to
complet
the
goal
so
from
that
standpoint
it
is
an
addict
in
a
game
where
you
will
never
complet
an
ultim
goal
well
it
would
be
like
fall
into
a
black
pit
it
is
easier
to
escap
into
a
control
fantasi
world
than
face
realiti
at
time
in
other
word
the
goal
offer
in
the
pc
game
are
easier
and
more
fun
than
the
real
world
pretti
scari
implic
if
you
think
about
it
i
cant
buy
world
of
warcraft
a
it
would
destroy
my
marrag
i
just
know
it
i
play
star
war
galaxi
for
about
a
year
and
can
attest
to
the
addict
of
these
game
they
are
all
engin
in
such
a
way
that
earli
on
in
the
game
you
progress
quickli
but
thi
progress
becom
exponenti
slower
requir
more
and
more
time
to
reach
the
next
level
im
sad
to
say
that
at
the
peak
of
my
addict
i
wa
spend
entir
weekend
in
front
of
my
monitor
slowli
build
up
my
charact
stop
onli
for

domin
year
of

life
they
were
wonder
year
and
i
still
have
vivid
memori
of
the
experi
and
friend
i
had
onlin
game
can
be
a
world
of
escap
where
you
can
be
yourself
without
fear
of
the
thought
of
other
someth
that
can
not
alway
be

in
the
day
to

run
of
a
normal
life
whilst
i
would
warn
against
peopl
give
to
much
of
there
life
to
these
game
i
believ
they
are
a
better
way
to
spend
your
time
than
say
watch

game
is
addict
and
should
be
made
a
recognis
addict
when
i
wa
singl
i
use
to
play
upto
eight
hour
a
night
after
work
everi
night
for
about
a
year
build
up
my
stat
complet
evermor
quest
and
battl

somehow
i
found
time
to
get
out
even
met
someon
and
got
marri
ha
my
life
chang

no
i
still
cast

and
battl
till
the
earli
hour
of
the
morn
on
with
the
fun
onlin

a
much
a
you

a
minor
allow

to
take

accord
to
thi
articl
the
same
is
true
of
mmorpg
the
messag
to
the
govern
is
clear
either
legalis
drug
or
outlaw
onlin
game
sound
like
there
are
some
sad
stori
here
and
i
can
believ
them
all
i
play
alot
of
warcraft
myself
and
know
full
well
how
addict
it
is
i
am
resolut
that
it
will
not
take
over
my
life
it
certainli
get
in
the
way
though
i
think
that
some
peopl
simpli
do
not
know
how
to
draw
thi
line
or
lack
the
willpow
to
stop
themselv
step
over
it
i
think
im
obsess
with
game
in
gener
i
spend
far
too
much
time
play
game
like
everquest
and
footbal
manag
rather
than
go
out
and
interact
with
real
peopl
and
when
i
do
tri
to
im
alway
think
in
the
back
if
my
mind
that
id
rather
be
in
front
of
the
comput
win
the
leagu
with
cambridg
unit
i
am
obsess
with
onlin
role
play
game
it
not
so
much
quest
but
it
ha
the
adrenalin
of
a
real
life
situat
goal
to
achiev
etc
i
spend
about
five
hour
per
day
onlin
play
it
and
i
rare
get
more
than
four
to
five
hour
sleep
befor
get
up
for
work
the
next
morn
a
mani
of
the
player
spend
their
time
in
mmorpg
rather
than
in
front
of
the
tv
i
fail
to
see
how
it
will
affect
player
social
life
neg
furthermor
these
type
of
game
contain
a
huge
social
aspect
wherea
other
game
and
some
other
pursuit
such
a
be
a
couch
potato
the
player
could
be
indulg
in
are
solitari
by
natur
these
game
are
like
most
thing
too
much
of
anyth
is
a
bad
thing
but
a
long
a
you
can
walk

obsess
that
i
cant
control

you
reccomend
a
counsellor

is
not
a
wind
up
but
someth
im
increasingli
concern
with
me
and
my
mate

onlin
for
an
hour
or
two
a
day
were
both
awar
of
how
much
time

disappear
by
sit
in
front
of
a
tv
tri
to
frag
some
individu
it
get
the
balanc
between
get
home
and
relas
the
stress
of
a
day
by
an
hour
or
so
game
and
enjoy
real
life

i
dont
think

just
what
they
are
let
there
child
into
unless
there
is
undeni
medic
proof
that
stare
at
a
comput
screen
for
hour
at
a
time
can
damag
a
person
health
you
can
expect
thi
not
to
declin
but
to
get
wors
these
peopl
are
pathet
they
need
to
get
off
their
machin
and
notic
that
our
world
is
be
swiftli
overcom
by
issu
and
troubl
that
make
the
trifl
worri
of
