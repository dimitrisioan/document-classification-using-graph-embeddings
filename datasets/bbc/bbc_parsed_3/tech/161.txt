pa
by

directli
on

or
other
part
of
the
bodi
say
ian

bt
resid
futurologist
it
all
part
of
what
known
a
a
pervas
ambient

where
chip
are
everywher
mr
pearson
doe
not
have
a
crystal
ball
hi
job
is
to
formul
idea
base
on
what
scienc
and
technolog
are
do
now
to
guid
industri
into
the
futur
inanim
object
will
start
to
interact
with
u
we
will
be
surround
on
street
in
home
in
applianc
on
our
bodi
and
possibl
in
our
head
by
thing
that
think
forget
local
area
network
these
will
be
bodi
area
network
idea
about
just
how
smart
small
or
even
invis
technolog
will
get
are
alway
float
around
imag
of
devic
clumsili
bolt
on
to
head
or
wrist
have
pervad
think
about
futur
technolog
but
now
a
new
vision
is
surfac
where
smart
fabric
and
textil
will
be
exploit
to
enhanc
function
form
or
aesthet
such
materi
are
alreadi
start
to
chang
how
gadget
and
electron
are
use
and
design
so
mp
player
the
mass
gadget
of
the
moment
will
disappear
and
instead
becom
integr
into
one
cloth
say
mr
pearson
so
the
gadget
that
fill
up
your
handbag
when
we
integr
those
into
fabric
we
can
actual
get
rid
of
all
that
stuff
you
wont
necessarili
see
the
electron
wearabl
technolog
could
exploit
bodi
heat
to
charg
it
up
while
video
tattoo
or
intellig

len
might
function
a

screen
for
those
on

howev
thi
futur
of

devic
where

is
worn
or
even

rais

question
if
technolog
is
go
to
be
increasingli
part
of

jewelleri
and

there
need
to
be
some
seriou
think
about
what
it
mean
for

a

at

caution
we
cant
just

into

yet
thi

is
alreadi
upon

research
have
develop
comput

worn
in

base
on
the
idea
that
electr

sewn

have
alreadi
appear

these
smart

have
come
about
through
advanc

microengin
the
abil
to
manipul

at
the

can
be

unusu

that
can
be
exploit
to
build
faster
lighter
stronger
and
more
effici
devic
and
system
the
textil

industri
ha
been
one
of
the
first
to

these

baro

is
concern
about
how

more

our

bodi

do

everywher

we
have

mr
