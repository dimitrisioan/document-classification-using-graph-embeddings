what
highdefinit

first
it
wa
the
humbl
home
video
then
it
wa
the
dvd
and
now
hollywood
is
prepar
for
the
next
revolut
in
home
entertain
highdefinit
highdefinit
give
incred
dlike
pictur
and
surround
sound
the
dvd
disk
and
the
gear
to

them

not
be
out
for
anoth
year
or
so
and
there
at
are
still
a
number
of
issu
to
be
sort
out
but
when
highdefinit
film
do
come
out
on
the
new
format
dvd
it
will
profoundli
chang
home
entertain
for
rick
dean
director
of
busi
develop
for
digit
content
compani
thx
a
highdefinit
futur
is
an
excit
prospect
he
ha
work
on
the
star
war
dvd
trilog
find
nemo
the
incred
and
indiana
jone
there
wa
a
time
not
so
long
ago
when
the
film
world
and
the
video
world
were
two
complet
separ
world
he
told
the
bbc
news
websit
the
technolog
we
are
deal
with
now
mean
they
are
veri
much
conjoin
the
film
that
we
see
in
theatr
is
come
from
the
same
digit
file
that
we
take
the
home
video
master
he
say
but
current
put
a
master
featur
film
onto
dvd
requir
sever
compress
becaus
current
dvd
technolog
can
not
hold
a
much
a
highdefinit
film
demand
a
much
a
you
compress
the
pictur
data
rate
wise
you
also
take
qualiti
away
from
the
pictur
that
we
fight
so
hard
to
keep
in
the
master
he
explain
i
would
love
to
be
abl
to
show
peopl
what
project
that
we
work
on
realli
look
like
in
the
highdef
world
and
i
find
it
veri
excit
highdefinit
dvd
can
hold
up
to
six
time
more
data
than
the
dvd
we
are
use
to
it
will
take
time
though
to
persuad
peopl
who
spent
money
on
dvd
player
to
buy
the
differ
player
and
display
requir
to
watch
highdefinit
dvd
in
month
time
mr
dean
is
confid
though
i
think
if
they
see
real
hd
highdefinit
not
some
heavili
compress
version
of
it
there
is
such
a
remark
differ
i
have
heard
comment
from
peopl
who
say
the
imag
pop
off
the
screen
highdefinit
will
mean
some
chang
for
those
work
behind
the
scene
too
on
the
whole
produc
film
for
highdefinit
dvd
will
be
easier
in
some
way
becaus
le
compress
is
need
equal
it
may
mean
hollywood
studio
ask
for
more
to
be
put
onto
the
averag
dvd
when
we
master
movi
right
now
our
data
rate
are
run
at
about
gigabit
per
second
say
mr
dean
our
dvd
that
we
put
out
today
have
to
be
squash
down
to
about
five
or
six
megabit
per
second
that
a
huge
amount
of
compress
that
ha
to
be
appli
about
so
if
you
have
anyth
that
allow
more
space
you
dont
have
to
compress
so
hard
studio
could
fit
a
lot
more
market
materi
game
and
featur
onto
highcapac
dvd
current
an
entir
dvd
project
can
take
up
to
three
month
say
mr
dean
although
the
step
of
downconvert
will
be
bypass
thi
will
realist
onli
save
a
day
work
say
mr
dean
one
of
the
most
time
consum
element
is
build
dvd
navig
and
menu
system
on
the
fairli
complex
star
war
disk
make
sure
the
menu
button
work
took
human
hour
alon
if
studio
want
to
cash
in
on
the
extra
space
it
could
mean
extra
human
hour
for
which
someon
ha
to
pay
if
the
decis
on
the
studio
side
is
that
they
are
go
to
put
a
lot
more
on
these
disk
it
could
be
more
expens
becaus
of
all
the
extra
navig
that
is
requir
and
if
studio
do
focu
on
deliv
more
ad
valu
content
think
mr
dean
ultim
it
could
mean
that
they
will
want
more
money
for
it
those
cost
could
filter
down
to
the
price
ticket
on
a
highdefinit
dvd
but
if
the
consum
is
not
will
to
pay
a
premium
price
studio
will
listen
think
mr
dean
highdefinit
throw
up
other
challeng
to
film
maker
and
dvd
product
alik
more
clariti
on
screen
mean
film
maker
have
to
make
doubli
sure
that
attent
to
detail
is
meticul
when
we
did
the
first
hd
version
of
star
war
episod
i
everybodi
wa
veri
suntan
but
that
wa
makeup
in
the
hd
version
of
episod
i
all
these
makeup
line
show
up
explain
mr
dean
the
restor
of
the
older
star
war
episod
reveal
some
interest
item
too
there
are
scan
of
a
corridor
on
the
death
star
and
fairli
plainli
in
one
of
those
shot
there
is
a
file
cabinet
stuck
behind
one
of
the
doorway
you
never
use
to
be
abl
to
see
it
becaus
thing
are
just
blur
enough
dure
the
pan
that
you
just
didnt
see
it
what
highdefinit
revolut
ultim
mean
is
that
the
line
between
home
entertain
and
cinema
world
will
blur
with
home
theatr
system
turn
live
room
into
cinema
thi
line
blur
even
further
it
could
also
mean
that
how
we
get
film
and
in
what
format
will
widen
in
the
futur
we
are
go
to
look
toward
file
deliveri
over
ip
internet
protocol
broadband
give
a
dvdlike
experi
from
the
settop
box
to
the
hard
drive
say
mr
dean
but
that
is
some
time
off
for
most
and
for
now
peopl
still
like
to
show
off
someth
physic
in
their
bookshelf
