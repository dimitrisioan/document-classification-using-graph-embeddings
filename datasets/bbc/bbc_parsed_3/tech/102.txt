is
unclear
jeffrey
matsuura
director
of
the
law
and
technolog
programm
at
the
univers
of
dayton
said
person
websit
can
be
hazard
for
both
employ
and
their

there
are
mani
exampl
of
employe
who
have
present
some
kind
of
materi
onlin
that
have
gotten
them
in
troubl
with

he
said
it
wa
crucial
that
ani
polici
about
what
wa
and
what
wa
not
accept
wa
express
clearli
wa
reason
and
enforc
fairli
in
compani
polici
you
have
to
rememb
that
a
an
employe
you
dont
have
total
free

anymor
he
said
mr
matsuura
ad
that
some
compani
activ
encourag
employe
to
blog
one
of
the
area
where
it
doe
becom
a
problem
is
that
they
encourag
thi
when
it
suit
them
but
they
may
not
be
particularli
clear
when
they
employe
do
cross
the
line
he
specul
that
delta
might
be
concern
that
the
fiction
content
on
the
blog
may
be
link
back
to
the
airlin
after
the
imag
of
m
simonetti
in
uniform
were
post
whether
or
not
that
is
success
will
depend
on
what
exactli
is
prohibit
and
whether
you
can
reason
say
thi
content
now
cross
that
line
he
said
m
simonetti
said
her
suspens
ha
caus
two
of
her
friend
to
discontinu
their
blog
one
of
them
wa
ask
to
stop

by
hi
compani
befor
ani
action
wa
taken
if
they
had

me
just
take
down
the
blog
i
would
have
done
it
but
that
wa
not
been
given
to
me
a
an
option
she
said
thi
blog
thing
is
obvious
a
new
problem
for
employ
and
they
need
to
get
a
polici
about
it
if
i
had
known
it
would
cost
me
my
job
i
would
not
have
done
that
