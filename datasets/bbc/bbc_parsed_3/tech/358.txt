what
price
for
trust
pc
secur
you
can
now
buy
trust
comput
but
can
we
realli
trust
the
pc
vendor
ask
technolog
analyst
bill
thompson
if
you
have
recent
bought
an
ibm
thinkvantag
comput
a
dell
optiplex
or
one
of
a
whole
rang
of
laptop
from
toshiba
hpcompaq
or
samsung
then
you
may
have
got
more
for
your
money
than
you
realis
insid
your
shini
new
pc
is
an
extra
chip
call
the
trust
platform
modul
tpm
that
can
be
use
for
a
rang
of
hardwarebas
secur
featur
eventu
the
tpm
will
be
built
into
the
main
processor
itself
and
if
the
trust
comput
group
ha
it
way
then
you
will
find
one
in
everi
piec
of
hardwar
you
own
from
mobil
phone
to
tv
set
top
box
to
children
toy
but
for
the
moment
it
is
a
separ
piec
of
hardwar
provid
enhanc
secur
featur
to
program
that
know
how
to
use
them
and
a
part
of
a
welldesign
network
system
it
can
provid
a
lot
more
secur
than
we
enjoy
today
a
big
advantag
of
the
tpm
is
that
it
is
hardwarebas
at
the
moment
most
of
u
reli
on
softwar
to
keep
our
inform
safe
and
secur
it
might
be
passwordprotect
user
account
data
encrypt
program
or
a
firewal
but
it
all
reli
on
program
code
run
on
an
inher
insecur
processor
hardwar
secur
is
le
common
even
if
it
is
a
lot
safer
thi
is
partli
becaus
it
is
more
expens
to
give
someon
a
smartcard
than
a
password
but
also
becaus
it
more
work
for
user
system
administr
and
manag
a
a
result
we
settl
for
second
best
so
when
it
come
to
comput
secur
trust
system
could
be
a
major
step
forward
after
all
if
you
have
a
laptop
that
will
onli
run
program
that
have
been
digit
sign
then
it
will
be
a
lot
harder
for
viru
writer
to
get
their
malici
code
to
run
and
if
all
your
file
are
lock
automat
then
even
if
you
get
your
comput
stolen
your
person
data
will
be
safeguard
at
the
moment
support
for
trust
hardwar
is
not
built
into
major
oper
system
instead
you
have
to
use
special
softwar
like
hp
protecttool
or
wave
system
embassi
thi
provid
file
encrypt
password
manag
and
ident
protect
usual
for
busi
user
who
connect
to
compani
network
full
support
for
the
trust
comput
specif
will
not
be
avail
from
microsoft
until
the
next
releas
of
window
longhorn
thi
will
includ
what
microsoft
in
a
typic
act
of
obscurant
call
the
next
gener
secur
comput
base
and
it
will
give
userlevel
program
access
to
the
trust
comput
hardwar
when
that
happen
we
can
expect
to
see
a
lot
of
public
around
the
new
capabl
and
no
doubt
the
window
secur
centr
will
encourag
user
to
turn
on
their
trust
comput
capabl
just
a
they
turn
on
their
firewal
howev
there
is
a
downsid
to
the
increas
secur
from
viru
spywar
and
data
theft
that
thi
will
provid
becaus
the
trust
comput
base
is
also
use
to
make
digit
right
manag
drm
system
more
secur
thi
will
give
content
provid
a
lot
more
control
over
what
we
can
do
with
music
movi
and
book
that
we
have
bought
from
them
we
have
seen
recent
how
allow
digit
right
manag
servic
into
our
life
can
lead
to
unwelcom

itun
use
to
be
abl
to
stream
the
music
they
had
brought
to
up
to
five
other

user
a
great
way
of
let
your

discov
your

collect
but
the
latest
version
of
itun
limit
thi
capabl
just
a
an

upgrad
reduc
the
number
of

you
could
burn

anoth
took
away
the
abil
to
play
song
download
from
real
harmoni
servic
on
your

appl
can
do
thi
becaus
they
wrote
the
softwar
and
they
control
the
right
manag
onc
it
is
embed
in
trust
hardwar
it
will
be
even
harder
for
dedic

to
find
their
way
around
these
restrict
and
give
u
back
the
fair

similarli
user
of
tivo
digit
video
record
have
found
that
they
can
not
record
some
show
and
other
programm
that
they
have
record
are
automat
delet
after
a
day
thi
happen
becaus
of
chang
that
tivo
have
made
to
their
softwar
and
the
user
can
not
control
it
one
wonder
whether
hardwarebas
drm
will
work
for
those
who
believ
that
lockingdown
digit
content
is
a
bad
idea
and
that
the
flexibl
of
copyright
law
is
someth
that
should
be
embrac
and
not
taken
away
it
will
not
work
becaus
of
the
fundament
flaw
at
the
heart
of
the
system
in
order
for
the
purchas
to
view
the
content
it
ha
to
be
unlock
onc
it
is
unlock
then
someon
somewher
will
figur
out
a
way
to
make
a
copi
of
the
unlock
version
and
onc
an
unlock
version
leak
onto
the
network
it
will
be
uncontrol
the
effort
go
into

would
be
much
better

what
we
want
is
not

much
a

a
a

the

the

they
will

i
want
to
watch
later
and
burn

a

which
respect
the
spirit
of

and
doe
not
seek
to
replac
it
by

we
need

remain
