perhap
more
import

of

is
the

role
in

on

the
big
trend
predict
for
thi

is
the
converg
of
comput
with
home
entertain
devic
such
a
dvd

and
hifi
compani
like
microsoft
and
soni
believ
that
there
is
a
lot
of
money
to
be
made
by
put
a
comput
underneath
the

of
everi
household
and
then
offer

a
give
an

microsoft
ha
alreadi
made

first
tactic
move
into

with
it
window
medium
center
softwar
which
ha
been
adopt
by

pc
maker
soni
had
a
stab
at
someth
similar
with
the

a
variat
on
the
playstat
last
year
in

although
thi
attempt
wa
gener
seen
a
a
failur
both
compani
believ
that
increas
the
capabl
of
game
consol
to
make
them
a
power
a
pc
will
make
the
technolog
access
enough
to
persuad
buyer
to
give
them
pride
of
place
on
the
video
rack
soni
and
ibm
want
to
make
sure
that
the
domin
of
the
pc
market
enjoy
by
microsoft
and
intel
is
not
allow
to
extend
to
thi
market
by
creat
a
radic
new
architectur
and
use
that
architectur
in
a
game
consol
that
is
sure
to
be
a
huge
seller
they
hope
that
the
cell
processor
can
becom
the
domin
technolog
in
the
live

shut
out
their
rival
onc
they
have
establish
themselv
under
the

there
is
no
doubt
that
they
hope
to
use
thi
a
a
base
camp
to
extend
their
might
into
our
tradit
pc
and
instig
a

cell
is
in
fact
specif
design
to

deploy
throughout

the

between
the
multipl

can
also
be
extend
to
reach
cell
processor
in

soni
hope
to
put

kitchen
applianc
and
anywher
that
could
use

sort
of

chip
each

will
be

creat
a
vast
home
network
of
comput
power
resourc
of
the
cell
across
the
hous
can
be
pool
to
provid
more
power
and
the

can
also
be
use
to
enabl
devic
to
talk
to
each

so
that
you
can
programm
your

thi

of
the

depend
on
the
widespread
adopt
of
the

processor
and
there
are
a
with
all
thing
a
number
of
reason
it
could
fail
becaus
the

is
so
differ
it
requir
programm
to

and
it
may
be
that
the
changeov
is
simpli
too
difficult
for

to
master
you
can
also
guarante
that
microsoft
and
intel
are
not
go
to
sit
around
and
let
cell
take
over
home
comput
without

microsoft
is

next

intel
will
be
furious
work
on

that
address
