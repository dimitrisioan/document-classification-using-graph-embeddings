alon
it
is
an
industri
that

too
the
partnership
between

is
part
of
tri
to
understand
the

like

net
accord
to
mr
stone
thi
is
not
just
about
put
art
galleri

onlin
he
said
it
is
about
how
can
everyon
have
the
best
seat
in

and
ask
if
technolog
ha
a
role
in
solv
that
problem
with
broadband
penetr
reach
in
the
uk
busi
with
a
stake
in
the
technolog
want
to
give
peopl
reason
to
want
and
use
it
the
creativ
drive
is
not
pure
altruist
obvious
it
is
about
both
industri
borrow
strategi
and
creativ
idea
togeth
which
can
result
in
better
busi
practic
for
creativ
industri
or
more

compani
what
