the
point
where
broadband
is
a
central
part
of
daili
life
at
least
for
some
argu
technolog
analyst
bill
thompson
one
of
the
nice
thing
about
be
a
writer
is
that
i
rare
have
to
go
to
an
offic
to
work
i
can
sit
in
a
caf
or
a
librari
with
or
without
a
wifi
connect
and
research
and
write
articl
if
i
am
pass
through
king
cross
station
on
my
way
to
a
meet
then
i
can
log
on
from
the
platform
and
i
can
spend
the
day
work
with
my
girlfriend
ann
a
children
writer
at
her
hous
in
cambridg
share
her
wireless
network
but
just
over
a
week
ago
i
arriv
at
her
hous
to
find
that
there
wa
no
network
connect
we
check
the
cabl
modem
and
notic
that
it
had
no
power
and
when
she
chang
the
power
lead
it
spark
at
her
in
a
way
which
made
it
abundantli
clear
that
it
wa
never
go
to
talk
to
the
internet
again
she
call
her
servic
provid
and
they
told
her
it
would
be
five
day
befor
an
engin
would
show
up
with
a
new
cabl
modem
thi
did
not
seem
too
bad
but
in
fact
she
realli
suffer
until
her
connect
wa
restor
on
wednesday
with
no
modem
instal
in
her
comput
she
had
to
borrow
internet
access
from
friend
or
use
the
dialup
connect
on
her
daughter
laptop
so
she
had
to
choos
between
copi
her
file
onto
her
usb
memori
card
or
accept
a
slower
and
flakier
net
connect
a
a
result
she
did
not
submit
the
pictur
she
want
to
use
for
a
book
on
earthquak
becaus
they
were
too
big
to
send
over
dialup
she
could
not
research
other
materi
becaus
she
is
use
to
have
easi
access
to
a
fast
link
that
let
her
search
quickli
and
effect
but
the
impact
spread
into
her
person
life
too
she
did
not
take
her
child
to
the
cinema
dure
halfterm
becaus
she
could
not
find
out
which
film
were
show
at
the
local
cinema
she
plan
a
trip
to
norfolk
but
did
not
check
the
weather
becaus
the
onli
place
she
know
to
look
for
weather
inform
is
the
bbc
websit
and
she
did
not
know
where
to
go
fossilhunt
on
the
trip
becaus
she
could
not
type
fossil
norfolk
into
googl
of
cours
she
readili
admit
she
could
have
answer
these
question
if
she
had
look
in
the
local
paper
listen
to
the
radio
or
found
a
book
on
fossil
but
she
did
not
becaus
have
fast
alway
on
and
easi
access
to
the
net
ha
becom
part
of
the
routin
of
her
daili
life
and
when
it
wa
taken
away
it
wa
too
much
effort
to
go
back
to
the
old
way
of
do
thing
she
may
be
unusu
but
i
do
not
think
ann
is
alon
accord
to
ofcom
there
were
almost
four
million
broadband
user
in
the
uk
in
april
and
number
are
climb
fast
there
will
certainli
be
five
million
by
the
end
of
the
year
dialup
user
are
switch
to
broadband
my
dad
final
made
the
chang
earlier
thi
month
and
new
net
user
are
select
broadband
from
the
start
more
and
more
of
these
broadband
user
are
begin
to
mould
their
daili
life
around
the
avail
of
broadband
internet
connect
and
they
too
will
find
it
difficult
to
cope
if
they
can
not
get
onlin
for
ani
reason
it
is
part
of
the
process
of
adapt
and
it
is
a
vital
step
in
the
growth
of
broadband
in
the
uk
and
elsewher
peopl
who
have
integr
net
access
into
their
daili
life
tell
their
friend
about
it
and
show
off
the
cool
stuff
they
can
do
they
encourag
other
peopl
to
get
broadband
so
that
they
can
share
digit
photo
and
do
all
of
the
other
thing
that
need
fast
and
reliabl
connect
of
cours
broadband
in
the
uk
is
laughabl
slow
compar
to
other
part
of
the
world
in
south
korea
japan
and
hong
kong
normal
connect
speed
are
measur
in
megabit
or
million
of
bit
a
second
rather
than
the
thousand
that
we
are
suppos
to
be
happi
with
but
speed
is
onli
a
small
part
of
the
attract
of
broadband
and
when
it
come
to
check
websit
for
film
time
look
at
weather
forecast
or
all
of
the
other
small
thing
that
make
a
real
differ
to
the
routin
and
habit
of
our
daili
life
even
uk
speed
are
suffici
it
may
not
be
the
brave
new
world
of
stream
fullscreen
video
and
superfast
file
download
but
it
will
do
for
now
and
it
is
certainli
better
than
