said
professor

dautenhahn
project
leader
at
hertfordshir
our
mission
is
to
look
at
how
such
a
robot
should
be
program
to
respect
person
space
of
human
the
research
also
focus
on
human
percept
of
robot
includ
how
they
should
look
and
how
a
robot
can
learn
new
skill
by
imit
a
human
demonstr
without
such
studi
you
will
build
robot
which
might
not
respect
the
fact
that
human
are
individu
have
prefer
and
come
from
differ
cultur
background
professor
dautenhahn
told
bbc
news
onlin
and
i
want
robot
to
treat
human
a
human
be
and
not
like
other
robot
she
ad
in
most
situat
a
companion
robot
will
eventu
have
to
deal
not
onli
with
one
person
but
also
with
group
of
peopl
to
find
out
how
they
would
react
the
hertfordshir
cogniron
team
taught
one
robot
to
play
passtheparcel
with
child
show
off
it
skill
at
the
scienc
museum
the
unnam
robot
had
to
select
approach
and
ask
differ
child
to
pick
up
a
parcel
with
a
gift
move
it
arm
a
a
pointer
and
it
camera
a
an

it
even
use
speech
to
give
instruct
and
play
music
howev
accord
to
research
it
will
still
take
mani
year
to
build
a
robot
which
would
make
full
use
of
the
robotiquett
for
human
interact
if
you
think
of
a
robot
a
a
companion
for
the
human
be
you
can
think
of
year
into
the
futur
conclud
professor
dautenhahn
it
might
take
even
longer
becaus
it
is
veri
veri
hard
to
develop
