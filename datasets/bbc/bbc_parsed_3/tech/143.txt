provid
the
abil
of
a
system
to
watch
what
go
on
and
make
decis
base
on
that
explain
dr
bowden
the
research
come
at
a
time
when
peopl
are
have
to
cope
with
an
increas
number
of
hitech
gadget
expert
say
a
much
more
natur
way
to
interact
with
these
devic
such
a
a
virtual
human
could
make
it
much
easier
to
make
the
most
of
all
those
new
gizmo
if
you
get
up
at
three
oclock
in
the
morn
and
you
go
downstair
there
are
probabl
two
thing
you
are
go
to
do
either
go
to
the
bathroom
or
mayb
you
are
go
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
said
dr
bowden
now
if
the
system
can
watch
your
behaviour
over
time
it
can
learn
thi
so
it
would
predict
what
you
are
go
to
do
turn
on
the
light
for
you
or
befor
you
even
get
to
the
kettl
it
could
have
switch
it
on
you
might
even
be
abl
to
tell
your
home
surveil
system
that
you
will
be
go
away
on
holiday
and
ask
if
it
could
make
sure
that
the
hous
is
secur
onc
you
have
left
thi
might
sound
like
a
scari
vision
of
an
orwellian
futur
but
it
might
all
depend
on
the
face
that
is
watch
you
when
we
put
the
surveil
camera
in
our
centr
a
lot
of
peopl
were
veri
unhappi
about
the
fact
that
there
wa
a
system
watch
them
said
dr
bowden
but
when
jeremiah
camera
went
in
nobodi
mind
becaus
although
it
still
watch
them
they
could
see
what
it
wa
watch
