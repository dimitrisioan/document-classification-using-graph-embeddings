loyalti
is
import
for

we

talk
more
about

brand
rather

brand
said
tim
hanlon
from

mediavest
the
realiti
is
that

be
the
produc
of

he
ad
the
challeng
now
is
that
it
is
hard
to
promot

with
so
much
choic
what
thi
mean
said
stacey
jolna
senior
vice
presid
of

guid
tv

is
that
the
way
peopl
find
the

ha
to
be
simplifi
for
tv
viewer
it
mean
that
network
in
u
term
or
channel
could
take
a
leaf
out
of
googl
book
and
be
the
search
engin
of
the
futur
instead
of
the
schedul
to
help
peopl
find
what
they
want
to
watch
thi
kind
of
channel
model
might
work
for
the
younger
ipod
gener
which
is
use
to
take
control
of
their
gadget
and
what
they
play
on
them
but
it
might
not
suit
everyon
the
panel
recognis
older
gener
are
more
comfort
with
familiar
schedul

brand
becaus
they

get
they
perhap
do
not
want
so
much
of
