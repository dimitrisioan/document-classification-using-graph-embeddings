footbal
manag
score
big
time
for
the
past
decad
or
so
the
virtual
footbal
fan
among
u
will
have
becom
use
to
the
annual
help
of
championship
manag
cm
inde
it
seem
like
there
ha
been
a
cm
game
for
a
mani
year
a
there
have
been
pc
howev
last
year
wa
the
final
time
that
develop
sport
interact
si
and
publish
eido
would
work
togeth
they
decid
to
go
their
separ
way
and
each
kept
a
piec
of
the
franchis
si
kept
the
game
code
and
databas
and
eido
retain
right
to
the
cm
brand
and
the
look
and
feel
of
the

at
the
begin
of
thi
year
fan
face
a
new
situat
eido
announc
the
next
cm
game
with
a
new

whilst
si
develop
the
exist
code

research
and
compil
by

you
can
take

even
barcelona
real
madrid
ac

the
list
go
on
a
veri
long
way
onc
in
a

be
told
by

be
a
case
of
champion
or
els
obvious
the
expect
are
link
to
the
team
you
choos
so
choos
wise
then
it
is
time
to
look
at
your
squad
work
out
your
tactic
see
how
much
cash
if
ani
you
have
got
to
splash
have
a
look
at
the
transfer
market
sort
out
the
train
schedul
and
make
sure
your
backroom
staff
are
up
to
it
then
bring
on
the
match
which
are
onc
more
avail
in
the
everimprov
top
down
d
view
with
the
except
of
the
improv
user
interfac
on
the
surfac
not
much
els
seem
to
have
chang
howev
there
have
been
a
lot
of
chang
under
the
bonnet
a
well
thing
like
the
manag
mindgam
which
let
you
talk
to
the
medium
about
the
opposit
boss
the
match
engin
is
also
much
improv
and
it
is
more
of
a
joy
than
ever
to
watch
in
fact
just
about
everi
area
of
the
game
ha
been
tweak
and
it
lead
to
an
ever
more
immers
experi
with
a
game
that
is
so
complex
and
so
openend
there
are
of
cours
a
few
glitch
but
nowher
near
the
sort
of
problem
that
have
blight
previou
releas
with
so
mani
calcul
to
perform
the
game
can
take
some
time
to
process
in
between
match
though
there
have
been
improv
in
thi
area
and
a
sport
like
footbal
which
is
so
high
profil
and
unpredict
itself
can
never
be
model
quit
to
everybodi
satisfact
but
thi
time
around
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
ha
been
put
in
to
ensur
that
ani
odditi
that
do
crop
up
are
cosmet
onli
and
do
not
affect
gameplay
and
if
there
are
problem
further
down
the
line
sport
interact
have
indic
their
usual
willing
to
support
and
develop
the
game
a
far
a
possibl
in
all
there
are
mani
more
tweak
and
improv
if
you
were
a
fan
of
the
previou
cm
game
then
fm
might
make
you
forget
there
wa
anyth
els
befor
it
if
you
are
new
to
the
genr
but
like
the
idea
of
tri
to
take
margat
into
the
premiership
spur
into
europ
or
even
put
ranger
back
on
the
top
of
the

fm
could
be
the
best
purchas
