what
next
for
nextgen
consol
the
next
gener
of
video
game
consol
are
in
develop
but
what
will
the
new
machin
mean
for
game
firm
and
consum
we
may
not
know
when
they
will
be
releas
what
they
will
be
call
or
even
what
they
will
be
abl
to
do
but
one
thing
is
certain
they
are
come
soni
microsoft
and
nintendo
are
all
expect
to
releas
new
machin
in
the
next
month
the
detail
of
playstat
xbox
codenam
xenon
and
nintendo
socal
revolut
are
still
to
be
finalis
but
develop
are
have
to
work
on
titl
for
the
new
machin
regardless
we
know
mayb
what
the
p
will
do
but
we
can
onli
guess
said
rori
arm
studio
gener
manag
for
video
game
giant
electron
art
in
europ
it
a
horrend
effort
in
the
first
year
he
admit
microsoft
had
deliv
develop
kit
to
ea
said
mr
arm
but
he
said
the
compani
wa
still
wait
on
soni
and
nintendo
to
send
kit
although
the
detail
may
not
be
nail
down
mr
arm
said
ea
wa
begin
to
get
a
sen
of
the
capabl
of
the
new
machin
the
rumour
are
that
playstat
will
have
a
littl
more
under
the
hood
than
xbox
he
said
microsoft
is
obvious
a
softwar
compani
first
and
foremost
while
soni
ha
more
experi
in
hardwar
i
think
soni
will
be
abl
to
push
more
into
a
box
at
cost
what
is
certain
is
that
the
new
machin
will
provid
great
leap
in
process
and
graphic
power
it
is
also
like
that
they
will
contain
converg
technolog
to
make
the
machin
more
of
an
entertain
hub
at
the
consum
electron
show
in
la
vega
microsoft
bos
bill
gate
said
xbox
would
be
part
of
hi
vision
of
the
digit
lifestyl
while
short
on
detail
he
paint
a
pictur
of
a
machin
that
would
complement
a
pc
and
offer
great
video
game
but
video
game
for
a
broader
set
of
peopl
more
commun
more
medium
more
connect
soni
is
thought
to
have
a
similar
vision
for
p
while
nintendo
remain
focus
on
a
machin
pure
for
game
until
it
is
clear
precis
what
the
new
machin
can
do
develop
are
work
on
a
first
round
of

mr
dunn
said
he
expect
the
introduct
of
realworld
physic
to
be
a
major
part
of
the
new
consol
we
want
to
increas
that
level
of
immers
and
realism
in

to
peopl
can
lose
themselv
in
a
game
in
the
first

at
least

should
not
expect

which
har
the
full

of

said
mr
florin
he
said
the
distribut

for

would
also
chang

mr

warn
that
develop
still
had
to
learn
how
to
tell

in
some
way
we
are
tri
to
forget
about

we
have
been

bad
at

what
we
have
to

mr

agre
we
can
