ukip
secret
weapon
by
ani
measur
new
yorker
dick
morri
is
that
thing
american
love
over
everyth
els
a
winner
thi
is
the
man
who
some
pundit
believ
wa
almost
singlehandedli
respons
for
bill
clinton
sensat
comeback
victori
but
morri
is
no
ideologu
he
ha
work
a
elect
strategist
for
ani
number
of
republican
a
well
and
more
recent
politician
from
mexico
to
uruguay
now
he
is
back
in
london
a
the
uk
independ
parti
notsosecret
elector
weapon
after
return
from
the
ukrain
where
he
help
you
guess
it
opposit
candid
viktor
yushchenko
if
there
is
one
regular
critic
level
at
morri
it
is
that
he
is
too
readi
to
switch
allegi
that
he
enjoy
the
game
more
than
the
polit
so
whi
britain
and
whi
ukip
which
despit
it
recent
eu
elect
success
is
not
like
to
pull
off
a
sensat
victori
in
the
loom
gener
elect
on
thi
subject
morri
appear
almost
evangel
i
wa
on
a
cruis
in
the
mediterranean
and
coincident
so
wa
ukip
leader
roger
knapman
i
had
just
written
a
piec
say
how
the
english
channel
wa
now
wider
than
the
atlant
which
he
like
and
it
went
from
there
but
what
is
it
about
ukip
that
particularli
attract
him
mani
might
think
it
is
simpli
anoth
chanc
to
practic
hi
art
irrespect
of
the
polit
i
think
the
greatest
threat
to
democraci
in
the
world
is
not
terror
but
bureaucrat
a
great
soundbit
but
a
surpris
come
from
a
new
yorker
post
septemb
it
is
the
growth
of
these
bodi
compos
of
expert
who
know
better
who
dont
believ
in
let
democraci
govern
but
believ
in
let
the
correct
solut
be
determin
that
intern
banker
the
world
trade
organis
the
intern
monetari
fund
the
world
bank
and
primarili
the
european
union
so
he
is
out
to
help
ukip
take
britain
out
of
thi
organis
which
he
belief
is
unreform
and
inher
undemocrat
and
he
is
scath
of
the
tori
parti
which
he
also
appear
to
believ
is
unreform
the
tori
parti
is
schizophren
about
europ
but
until
somebodi
say
they
are
will
to
leav
the
eu
they
cant
possibl
renegoti
anyth
a
michael
howard
is
pledg
to
do
it
like
walk
into
a
liquor
store
with
a
gun
to
rob
it
and
say
befor
i
can
proceed
with
the
robberi
i
want
to
make
clear
i
am
not
go
to
shoot
anybodi
possibl
a
veri
american
analog
but
anoth
great
soundbit
the
basic
point
is
that
the
eu
seek
polit
integr
to
move
the
entir
nexu
of
decis
make
away
from
britain
and
we
oppos
that
and
the
tori
can
not
be
trust
to
oppos
it
so
is
ukip
job
to
destroy
the
tori
a
former
member
robert
kilroysilk
onc
notori
declar
no
the
aim
of
ukip
is
to
withdraw
from
the
eu
and
if
it
ha
ani
relat
to
the
tori
it
is
to
stiffen
the
tori
spine
on
the
issu
by
have
a
larg
enough
ukip
vote
so
that
we
move
the
tori
in
the
direct
they
are
refus
to
move
but
it
not
just
to
shift
the
tori
i
think
ukip
had
a
huge
amount
to
do
with
toni
blair
decis
to
hold
a
referendum
on
the
european
constitut
and
i
think
it
had
a
huge
amount
to
do
with
hi
refus
to
go
into
the
euro
and
while
we
are
on
the
subject
of
mr
kilroysilk
mr
morri
despatch
him
with
anoth
of
hi
neat
soundbit
robert
kilroy
silk
is
not
a
team
player
it
is
a
good
idea
our
parti
stand
for
some
thing
and
not
some
one
so
what
is
the
big
plan
for
the
gener
elect
how
will
he
achiev
the
breakthrough
look
we
are
not
go
to
be
form
the
next
govern
he
said
neither
doe
ukip
have
to
fight
everi
seat
a
with
the
u
presidenti
elect
he
say
the
outcom
will
be
decid
by
a
small
number
of
swing
seat
just
a
he
belief
it
will
in
britain
so
with
limit
resourc
the
aim
is
to
target
those
seat
and
end
the
day
with
a
signific
group
in
the
common
he
also
belief
it
is
possibl
the
internet
could
have
a
big
part
in
the
poll
the
internet
wa
a
decis
factor
in
the
presidenti
elect
through
blog
individu
post
their
view
in
onlin
diari
peopl
just
did
it
anyth
can
happen
in
the
next
gener
elect
there
is
an
inher
instabl
at
the
moment
labour
and
the
tori
have
drawn
the
consensu
so
tightli
and
to
the
left
there
is
room
for
anoth
voic
that
might
he
suggest
lead
to
a
hung
parliament
with
ukip
and
other
hold
the
balanc
of
power
it
is
a
huge
task
sure
but
there
is
undoubtedli
a
sens
that
the
next
gener
elect
may
inde
produc
some
surpris
even
while
most
still
believ
it
is
labour
for
the
take
ukip
perform
in
last
year
european
elect
wa
just
such
a
shocker
and
show
that
mr
morri
may
have
a
point
about
the
new
consensu
and
after
all
he
ha
a
reput
to
sustain
