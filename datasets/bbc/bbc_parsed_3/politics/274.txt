it
is
almost
imposs
not

say
africa
ha
been
import

believ
it
is
time
for
the
world
to
see
a
new
gordon
brown
not
the
dull
reassur
bank
manag

a

passion
and
it
just
so
happen
the
labour

feel
an
aw

happier
rid
the

than
rid
the
world
of

there
also
a
sen
of
liber
if
mr
blair
wont
allow
him
to
run
the

he
still
got
to
overcom
not
onli
the
reluct
of

also
the
cynic
