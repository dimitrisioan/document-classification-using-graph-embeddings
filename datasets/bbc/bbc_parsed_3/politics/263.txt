the

the
prison
best
strategi
is
to
keep
their
mouth
shut
and
take
the
short
sentenc
but
the

sheriff
ha
an
idea
to
induc
them
to
talk
he
tell
each
prison
separ
that
if
they
confess
and
they
are
the
onli
one
to

theyll
be
let

and
he
tell
them
that
if
they
dont
confess
and
they
are
the
onli
one
not
to
confess
theyll
get
life
now
if

youll

doe

youd
better
confess
to

the
