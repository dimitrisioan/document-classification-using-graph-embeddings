the
preelect
messag
mani
in
hi
parti

been
press
for
and
voter
he
belief
will
warm
to
at
it
simplest
it
is
say
vote
tori
and
you
can
have
it
both
way
not
onli
would
hi
govern
stick
to
labour
spend
plan
on
core
public
servic
includ
health
and
educ
it
would
increas
spend
on
defenc
polic
and
pension
and
even
after
that
wa
done
it
would
still
have
enough
left
over
for
a
tax
cut
equival
to
about
a
penni
off
the
basic
rate
of
incom
tax
all
the
money
would
come
from
it
â£
billion
effici
save
which
would
see
the
axe
taken
to
bureaucraci
wast
and
the
civil
servic
of
that
â£
billion
would
go
on
spend
plan
with
â£
billion
to
fill
the
black
hole
left
they
claim
by
gordon
brown
and
the
rest
go
in
tax
cut
neither
mr
howard
nor
mr
letwin
would
say
exactli
how
they
would
use
that
cash
although
a
cut
in
the
basic
rate
seem
unlik
idea
alreadi
float
includ
rais
tax
threshold
and
abolish
or
reduc
inherit
tax
although
some
in
the
tori
parti
are
urg
mr
howard
to
announc
someth
more
eyecatch
befor
the
elect
a
the
tori
leader
declar
the
aim
of
the
exercis
is
to
open
up
a
real
econom
polici
divid
between
labour
and
the
tori
at
thi
elect
peopl
will
have
a
clear
choic
between
mr
blair
who
will
wast
more
and
tax
more
and
the
conserv
parti
which
will
give
valu
for
money
and
tax
le
he
said
it
is
a
move
back
toward
an
almost
tradit
tori
messag
which
previous
suggest
labour
wa
the
parti
of
tax
rise
and
the
conserv
the
parti
of
tax
cut
the
extens
of
that
howev
wa
that
labour
wa
also
seen
a
the
parti
of
big
spend
on
the
public
servic
while
the
tori
were
the
cutter
and
that
is
where
one
of
the
problem
lie
for
mr
howard
can
he
persuad
sceptic
voter
that
they
realli
can
have
it
both
way
with
bigger
spend
on
public
servic
and
lower
tax
he
insist
he
will
not
promis
anyth
befor
the
elect
that
he
can
not
deliv
if
put
into
down
street
labour
needl
to
say
claim
hi
plan
â£bn
effici
save
simpli
dont
add
up
and
that
those
sort
of
figur
are
fantasi
one
of
new
labour
greatest
success
befor
the
histor
elect
wa
to
persuad
voter
busi
and
the
citi
that
it
could
be
trust
to
run
the
economi
so
far
that
ha
not
face
ani
real
challeng
but
independ
analyst
now
claim
a
third
new
labour
govern
would
be
forc
to
either
increas
taxat
or
tax
to
plug
a
black
hole
it
ha
at
the
centr
of
it
financ
meanwhil
the
liber
democrat
are
commit
to
increas
tax
for
the
most
well
off
to
financ
their
spend
propos
launch
earlier
in
the
day
so
mr
howard
hope
hi
messag
will
start
to
hit
home
dure
thi
unoffici
elect
campaign
and
that
hi
poll
rate
might
final
lift
off
the
floor
and
while
other
issu
like
the
iraq
war
and
trust
will
play
a
major
part
in
that
campaign
it
is
like
and
the
prime
minist
probabl
hope
that
the
economi
will
be
the
decid
factor
