quickli
ad
in
so
far
a
i
read

had
been
full
of
stori
about

between
the
two
men
a
far
a
the
time
of
the
prime

confer
is
concern
there
are
two
option
the
first
is
that
it
wa
a
calcul
attempt
to
upstag
the
chancellor
and
seiz
back
the
initi
on
the
big
issu
of
the
moment
if
that
is
the
case
it
suggest
that
even
the
fear
of
serious
neg
newspap
headlin
is
not
enough
to
stop
the
squabbl
the
second
option
is
that
it
wa
an
unavoid
coincid
which
would
suggest
the
govern
ha
lost
it
oncefam
abil
to
strictli
coordin
announc
through
the
infam
down
street
grid
to
avert
just
such
alleg
either
way
the
effect
wa
the
same
to
overshadow
the
big
announc
of
govern
polici
on
a
huge
pertin
issu
and
there
had
been
previou
suggest
that
the
new
year
had
start
with
a
fresh
outbreak
of
the
warfar
between
the
two
men
firstli
the
prime

countri
it
wa
claim
he
had
been
embarrass
by
the
fact
that
gordon

appear
to
have
taken
the
initi
over
the
govern
respons
to
the
disast
while
mr
blair
wa
still
on
holiday
in

then
a
if
to
pour

claim
that
mr

that
he

and
had
a
a
result

the
fact
that

inconceiv
the

the

the
big
fear
with

now
is
that
unless
