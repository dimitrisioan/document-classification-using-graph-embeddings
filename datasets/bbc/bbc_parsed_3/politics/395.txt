hi
campaign
bo
alan
milburn
have
alreadi
insist
the

will
be
fought
on
the
economi
and
what
they
claim
is
a
stark
choic
between
labour
stabil
and
invest
against

to
the
relief
of
mani
of
hi
support
in

to
underlin
that
econom
messag
and
it
is
certain
one
of
the
big
argument
at
the
centr
of
the

battl
will
be
around
the
big

but
the

had
been
done
and
the
falter
labour
campaign
wa
back
on
track
a
second
central
argument
will
be
over
