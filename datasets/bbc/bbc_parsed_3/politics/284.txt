kennedi
cautiou
optim
charl
kennedi
is
far
too
canni
to
make
ani
grand
claim
about
how
hi
parti
may
fare
at
the
gener
elect
in
hi
year
in
the
common
he
ha
seen
hi
fair
share
of
such
claim
dash
on
the
rock
of
bitter
experi
and
he
might
say
the
uk
polit
and
elector
system
but
even
hi
caution
can
not
hide
the
fact
that
thi
is
a
parti
and
a
leader
that
believ
it
may
well
be
on
the
way
to
someth
special
in
a
few
month
time
look
i
have
alreadi
said
i
am
not
go
to
put
ani
artifici
limit
on
our
ambit
thi
time
around
he
said
he
still
seem
to
accept
that
the
most
like
outcom
is
anoth
labour
victori
of
some
sort
and
hi
gener
elect
pitch
is
design
around
the
notion
of
the
lib
dem
a
the
real
opposit
but
doesnt
that
lead
to
the
jibe
that
hi
is
a
parti
activ
bid
to
come
second
he
is
prepar
to
go
thi
far
a
clear
conclus
ha
been
reach
includ
by
conserv
that
the
conserv
are
not
go
to
win
thi
elect
therefor
the
potenti
is
there
for
the
liber
democrat
advanc
to
be
one
of
the
big
stori
of
the
elect
given
that
we
have
the
capac
to
take
on
labour
and
win
a
well
a
take
on
the
conserv
and
win
thi
is
realli
go
to
be
the
first
modern
three
parti
uk
elect
that
we
have
all
experienc
but
havent
we
been
here
befor
with
suggest
in
the
s
that
labour
wa
finish
wont
voter
look
for
an
altern
to
labour
still
natur
gravit
to
the
conserv
the
problem
is
that
geograph
the
conserv
parti
ha
melt
away
in
about
a
third
of
britain
we
have
supplant
them
a
the
main
altern
to
labour
in
whole
tract
of
mainland
britain
and
they
are
a
parti
with
an
age
and
declin
membership
base
and
they
just
do
not
look
vibrant
or
vital
or
in
touch
ani
longer
with
contemporari
britain
mr
kennedi
is
also
eager
to
dispel
ani
impress
hi
parti
is
the
new
parti
of
the
left
and
is
like
to
attract
mostli
disillus
labour
voter
he
insist
hi
three
headlin
commit
to
be
financ
from
a
tax
increas
on
those
earn
over
â£
a
year
will
appeal
right
across
the
polit
spectrum
they
are
to
replac
the
council
tax
with
a
local
incom
tax
provid
free
long
term
care
for
the
elderli
and
scrap
student
fee
he
also
believ
be
the
onli
major
parti
promis
to
increas
tax
will
not
land
him
in
the
same
troubl
a
similar
polici
did
to
old
labour
i
think
the
tax
argument
ha
move
on
a
lot
in
british
polit
particularli
in
the
context
of
the
forthcom
gener
elect
he
said
under
a
labour
govern
the
tax
burden
would
have
to
rise
while
the
torus
plan
to
increas
spend
in
some
area
while
also
reduc
tax
is
just
incred
he
claim
we
are
be
straightforward
with
peopl
say
you
know
there
is
like
to
be
an
increas
in
the
tax
burden
we
are
onli
recommend
one
specif
tax
rise
for
the
top
end
of
incom
scale
earner
to
fund
three
specif
polici
that
is
a
clear
cut
choic
for
peopl
one
i
am
veri
comfort
with
and
i
think
will
distinguish
u
from
the
other
a
to
hi
own
futur
he
is
clear
if
a
expect
hi
parti
increas
it
show
at
the
elect
he
intend
to
go
into
the
next
parliament
on
the
front
foot
with
a
view
to
lead
it
right
through
that
parliament
into
the
next
elect
becaus
i
see
that
a
the
decis
opportun
for
u
that
last
remark
reflect
a
view
gain
ground
in
westminst
that
if
the
torus
do
a
badli
a
some
fear
the
elect
after
next
might
realli
see
that
histor
breakthrough
by
the
third
parti
perhap
then
mr
kennedi
will
be
readi
to
put
some
of
the
caution
to
one
side
