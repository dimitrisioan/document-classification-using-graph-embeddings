he

abil

peopl
but
sadli
after
the
european
elect
it
becam
clear
that
he
wa
more
interest
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
parti
than
the
uk
independ
parti
so
it
wa
nice
know
him
now
goodby
he
said
ukip
offici
also
argu
mr
kilroysilk
ha
not
been
straightforward
in
attack
the
parti
he
onc
want
to
lead
verita
it
the
bnp
in
an
expens
suit
it
all
well
and
good
robert
kilroysilk
claim
that
verita
is
a
parti
that
doesnt
believ
in
lie
and
spin
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
it
complet
useless
due
to
proport
represent
there
is
no
chanc
that
verita
will
have
ani
chanc
in
claim
power
and
chang
the
twohors
race
trend
in
my
opinion
thi
is
just
a
public
stunt
which
ha
just
been
use
a
a
smokescreen
for
hi
antiislam
slur
which
got
him
sack
from
the
televis
i
think
that
hi
view
regard
immigr
are
share
by
mani
it
realli
is
time
that
the
uk
govern
ceas
to
be
a
paper
tiger
on
thi
issu
in
addit
a
an
ashfield
constitu
i
would
be
more
than
interest
in
kilroy
silk
oppos
geoff
hoon
good
to
see
the
parti
of
the
right
splinter
in
the
way
the
parti
of
the
left
have
alway
done
let
hope
kilroysilk
ukip
and
the
euroscept
wing
of
the
torus
parti
all
fade
further
into
obscur
so
we
can
have
some
truth
in
the
debat
about
europ
we
benefit
enorm
from
our
membership
of
the
eu
we
need
to
be
at
the
heart
of

lead
it
and
drive
it
to
where
we
a
a

want
to
go
not
run

may
just
end
up

into

whatev
kilroysilk

ukip
do
none
of
their
antieuropean
polici
have

england
thi
new
parti
might
gain
support
from
rightw
england
but
will
have
littl
impact
in
wale
or
scotland
hope
thi
all
thi
fight
within
euroscept
parti
will
allow
them
to
slip
out
of
the

and
get
peopl
vote
for

the

disillus
with

polit
kilroy
ha
one
agenda
the
uk
and
ill
be
vote
for
him
both
ukip
and

are
repres
of
smallminded
and
a
lack
of
vision
for
the
whole
of
humankind
the
interest
of
human
and
the
world
lie
so
much
beyond

of

bicker
that
who
in

switch

that
got

halfway
serious
diminish
your
credibl
the
veri
idea
of

parti
born
out
of
such
neg
feel
a
eurosceptic
or
british
supremaci
is
nauseat
one
can
onli
hope
the
public
recognis
these
extremist
for
what
they
are
and
shun
them
at
the
poll
ive
alway
thought
that
kilroysilk
wa
a
selfpublicis
egotist
and
thi
news
doe
absolut
noth
to
alter
my
opinion
brilliant
about
time
thi
countri
had
a
plausibl
parti
have
seen
the
recent
bbc
documentari
and
wit
the
thoroughli
disgrac
chauvinist
behaviour
of
a
number
of
senior
ukip
figur
i
can
well
understand
whi
kilroysilk
feel
embarrass
to
be
associ
with
such
peopl
hope
the
ukip
member
who
are
interest
in
the
polit
debat
will
support
hi
action
fantast
news
proeuropean
now
have
far
le
to
worri
about
from
the
right
the
conserv
are
a
confus
a
they
have
been
sinc
the
mid
and
the
extrem
antieuropean
are
fractur
themselv
into
splinter
group
that
split
ani
vote
they
might
get
in
local
european
and
gener

robert
kilroysilk
ego
and
vaniti
are
hi
own
and
hi

worst
enemi
a
a
euroenthusiast
i
could
not
be
more
delight
by
kilroysilk
behaviour
he
took
a
parti
that
wa
just
build
up
a
head
of
steam
and
have
expo
it
to
ridicul
by

the
closer
to

the

a
far
a
i
am
concern

in

the

will
exhaust
their
energi
fight
each

if
everi
politician
with
ambit
to
lead
their

resort
to
form
their
own
for
that
purpos
wed
have
ballot
paper
a
mile
long
youv
got
to
hand
it
to
kilroysilk
for
hi
sheer
arrog
and
suprem
selfbelief
whilst
not
be
a
great
fan
of
kilroy
i
do
agre
with
hi
comment
about
the
ukip
leadership
and
like
him
i
am
also
leav
ukip
i
believ
countless
opportun
have
been
lost
to
discredit
the
eu
and
to
show
our
peopl
what
belong
to
the
eu
realli
mean
the
eu
comment
last
week
about
michael
howard
plan
to
reform
immigr
show
how
littl
we
govern
our
own
countri
when
they
can
turn
round
and
say
immigr
is
a
matter
for
the
eu
and
not
individu
member
state
the
sooner
we
leav
thi
corrupt
superst
the
better
doe
anyon
el
think
that
it
is
iron
that
euroscept
kilroysilk
ha
use
a
latin
name
for
hi
new
parti
rather
than
a
good
old
british
name
is
thi
indic
of
the
man
contradictori
vain
and
pompou
i
think
mr
kilroysilk
ha
got
a
veri
good
point
british
polit
ha
becom
too
pc
and
a
a
result
ha
no
straight
talk
honest
strong
politician
they
are
all
interest
in
their
own
career
and
not
the
peopl
who
put
them
in
power
a
a
result
i
feel
our
democraci
is
be
abus
and
i
want
it
stop
if
mr
kilroysilk
live
up
to
half
hi
promis
he
will
get
my
vote
honestli
who
realli
care
man
with
tan
leav
parti
with
no
plan
to
set
up
parti
with
no
idea
a
one
of
kilroysilk
east
midland
constitu
i
hope
those
who
vote
for
him
are
proud
to
have
been
taken
in
by
such
charm
vacuiti
i
feel
insult
by
have
him
repres
me
in
the
european
parliament
ukip
tri
hard
to
accommod
robert
kilroy
silk
but
he
made
it
clear
that
onli
control
of
it
would
satisfi
him
someon
so
keen
on
complet
control
wa
bound
to
fall
foul
of
ukip
democrat
natur
kilroy
is
an
abl
commun
and
a
capabl
politician
in
exactli
the
way
those
who
lead
ukip
are
not
he
tri
to
make
it
work
but
they
didnt
seem
to
want
to
grow
up
he
wa
left
in
the
posit
of
have
to
defend
their
gaff
to
the
medium
thi
new
parti
seem
a
logic
next
step
for
kilroy
good
luck
to
the
man
i
say
oh
plea
thi
is
an
amus
irrelev
there
is
absolut
no
chanc
of
either
of
these
parti
commun
a
sensibl
and
construct
euroscept
argument
they
will
play
a
key
part
in
win
the
countri
round
to
the
idea
of
a
reform
more
democrat
more
dynam
europ
union
futur
gener
will
thank
him
for
hi
ridicul
the
refresh
thing
about
robert
is
that
he
is
open
honest
and
straight
what
other
politician
can
claim
thi
i
have
a
suspicion
that
he
talk
for
a
larger
part
of
the
elector
that
hi
critic
would
like
i
shall
be
vote
for
him
the
elector
of
the
east
midland
vote
not
for
kilroysilk
but
for
the
ukip
kilroysilk
wa
made
an
mep
becaus
of
hi
posit
on
the
ukip
parti
list
he
ha
no
mandat
to
repres
the
area
and
should
resign
from
the
european
parliament
i
wouldnt
write
off
kilroysilk
while
he
a
clown
and
a
one
man
band
at
the
moment
he
a
populist
and
that
alway
dangerousth
man
clearli
ha
an
enorm
ego
and
look
at
our
current
polit
master
that
seem
to
be
one
of
the
factor
in
success
good
luck
to
kilroy
though
i
think
he
is
do
more
harm
than
good
for
both
hi
new
parti
and
ukip
becaus
their
vote
base
is
not
strong
enough
for
both
parti
to
be
success
and
at
the
moment
ukip
have
the
upper
hand
while
verita
are
start
from
squar
one
and
fight
a
somewhat
uphil
battl
the
man
i
onc
found
cring
worthi
on

time
tv
could
well
turn
out
to
be
my
countri
knight
in
shine
armour
he
express
view
which
are
now
more
than
common
amongst
societi
today
but
peopl
are
almost
too
scare
to
express
them
kilroy
silk
ha
secur
my
vote
and
mani
more
like
me
what
more
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
he
claim
victori
wreck
the
eu
and
rescu
my
great
nation
without
a
hair
out
of

and
hi
tan
a

the

englishspeak
countri
fulli
commit

oh
and
send
u
over
those
hardwork
immigr
our
economi
need
them
thi
is
just
what
the
europhil
pray
for
a
the
main
euroscept
parti
ukip
should
tri
to
resolv
it
differ
with
kilroy
to
show
a
unit
front
and
give
the
uk
public
a
seriou
polit
voic
against
europ
have
multipl
parti
with
the
same
view
point
just
split
the

further
thank
good
that
kilroysilk
ha
gone
now
ukip
at
least
ha
a
chanc
in
the
elect
it
is
veri
sad
to
see
the
caus
of
britain
regain
it
proper
relationship
with
europ
damag
by
thi
split
within
ukip
robert
kilroysilk
could
have
a
lot
to
offer
instead
we
have
a
split
parti
and
a
damag
caus
under
the
present
elector
system
peopl
must
work
togeth
and
small
parti
have
no
hope
of
represent
last
summer
ukip
achiev
a
major
advanc
partli
and
onli
partli
due
to
kilroysilk
it
is
a
great
shame
thi
ha
been
dissip
in
infight
ukip
ha
a
wide
platform
of
polici
not
just
withdraw
from
the
eu
thi
kilroysilk
conveni
ignor
in
the
comment
surround
the
launch
of
hi
own
parti
neither
the
english
democrat
nor
the
new
parti
were
interest
in
let
him
join
them
and
take
over
their
leadership
speak
volum
verita
is
the
begin
of
the
end
for
kilroysilk
if
he
believ
in
truth
and
democraci
then
he
and
the
two
assembl
member
should
resign
and
forc
a
byelect
to
stand
on
their
own
platform
rather
than
thi
backdoor
approach
to
polit
of
be
elect
for
one
parti
then
defect
to
anoth
so
ukip
wa
good
enough
for
him
to
lead
not
good
enough
for
him
to
follow
interest
that
a
parti
commit
to
plain
speak
should
have
a
latin
name
everi
opinion
poll
point
to
an
overwhelm
antieurop
feel
in
thi
countri
kilroysilk
could
be
on
the
verg
of
someth
huge
if
he
can
broaden
hi
appeal
beyond
thi
one
issu
he
is
an
extrem
abl
commun
with
year
of
polit
experi
we
want
qualiti
school
top
hospit
clean
and
effici
public
transport
punish
that
fit
the
crime
limit
asylum
a
purg
on
bureaucraci
and
le

it
need
courag
and
honesti
two
qualiti
sadli
lack
in
our
politician
kilroysilk
may
just
have
those
veri
qualiti
recruit
the
right
colleagu
robert
and
your
time
may
have
come
well
if
you
can
not
get
enough
limelight
be
an
ordinari
mp
then
go
out
and
start
up
your
own
parti
it
all
flash
and
no
real
polici
here
let
hope
thi
is
the
start
of
both
ukip
and
kilroysilk
slip
into
obscur
verita
the
name
will
doom
it
but
perhap
i
am
wrong
for
sure
all
modern
schoolchildren
will
understand
it
sinc
they
do
still
learn
latin
in
the
classroom
do
they
not
the
whole
essenc
of
what
rk
repres
is
eurosceptic
so
explain
to
me
how
the
tootwe
label
of
verita
symbolis
that
