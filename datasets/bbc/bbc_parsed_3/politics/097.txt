a
wider
debat
urgent
about
how
we
can
actual
get
trial
and
convict
in
thi
countri
unless
we
get
that
the

said
it
appear
mr

wa
put
more
emphasi
on
the
possibl
of
deport
than
hi
predecessor
david
blunkett
but
he
said
reach
an
understand
with
some
of
the
detaine
home
countri
could
be
difficult
some
of
these
peopl
are
accus
of
veri
veri
seriou
crime
in
their
home
countri
so
it
not
an
easi
agreement
to
get
and
i
think
for
some
of
these
suspect
it
wont
be
the
solut
daniel
sandford
said
minist
may
tri
to
put
forward
other
solut
such
a
allow
more
secret
evid
to
be
put
into
normal
crimin
trial
or
develop
a
more
secret
trial
process
in
the
next
few
week
the
govern
may
tri
and
deport
some
of
them
and
then
those
that
are
left
see
if
they
can
work
out
some
way
of
put
