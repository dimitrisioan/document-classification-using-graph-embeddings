confirm
which

routin
take
decis
of
thi
natur
and
what
inform
they
are
base
on

glenn
campbel
said
the
first

had
order
an
urgent

he
said
we
understand
from

that
in
thi
case
no
individu
minist
sign
off
the
approv
for
michael
ferguson
to
be
releas
unescort
from
carstair
the
execut
conced
that
it
is
up
to
scottish
minist
they
have
a
legal
respons
for
approv
thi
sort
of
leav
but
they
say
routin
it
is
specialis
offici
that
make
that
decis
and
simpli
inform
minist
that
they
have
taken
it
but
at
that
stage
presum
minist
can
ask
hard
question
and
can
ask
for
reassur
that
the
patient
is
not
a
seriou
danger
to
the
public
or
that
ani
risk
ha
been

minist
were
told

but
it
would
not
be
common
practic
for
them
to
sign
it
off
they
do
have
statutori
respons
but
the
common
practic
ha
been
that
peopl
who
work

have
the
best
knowledg
about

would
make
