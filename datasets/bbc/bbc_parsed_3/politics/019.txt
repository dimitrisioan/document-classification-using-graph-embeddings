had
help
to
move

problem
mr

said
scotsman
journalist
hamish
macdonel
said
he
believ
the
bigger
pictur
had
been
obscur
by
the
remark
mr
mcconnel
wa
speak
on
monday
to
more
than
secondari
pupil
from
school
in
the
highland
about
the
problem
of
bing
drink
and
drink
promot
the
onesent
comment
wa
immedi
criticis
by
the
scottish
nation
parti
which
accus
him
of
encourag
young
peopl
to
get
drunk
but
the
scottish
execut
ha
insist
mr
mcconnel
wa
speak
about
adult
and
hi
comment
were
a
recognit
that
peopl
will
get
drunk
mr
macdonel
polit
editor
of
the
scotsman
said
i
think
we
have
to
say
right
at
the
outset
that
thi
wa
a
veri
stupid
and
illadvis
remark
by
the
first
minist
if
you
come
out
with
someth
like
thi
say
that
by
all
mean
get
drunk
then
you
will
be
pillori
for
it
howev
he
ad
that
perhap
mr
mcconnel
could
feel
rightli
aggriev
about
the
coverag
mr
macdonel
said
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
he
did
say
a
lot
more
thing
about
bing
drink
and
under
age
drink
but
that
whole
side
of
thing
ha
been
lost
in
the
furor
over
one
sentenc
i
understand
whi
but
i
think
there
is
a
much
bigger
messag
here
that
ha
been
obscur
mr
law
from
voluntari
bodi
alcohol
focu
scotland
believ
damag
had
been
done
to
scotland
fight
against
bing
drink
he
said
he
accept
that
young
peopl
drank
and
they
did
have
problem
with
drink
mr
law
ad
i
think
the
remark
wa
illadvis
but
these
remark
are
blown
out
of
all
proport
and
they
so
easili
misrepres
what
we
are
tri
to
do
in
scotland
we
dont
want
to
preach
to
young
peopl
but
we
need
to
acknowledg
that
they
do
drink
problemat
thi
divert
u
from
the
real
issu
which
are
about
promot
respons
and
reduc
harm
and
inde
tackl
our
drink
cultur
which
is
a
cultur
about
bing
drink
and
drunken
he
said
it
wa
vital
that
young
peopl
were
properli
inform
about
the
risk
incur
to
themselv
and
other
when
they
got
drunk
mr
macdonel
said
that
the
first
minist
should
know
by
now
that
if
he
said
thing
which
were
off
the
mark
they
were
bound
to
come
back
and
bite
him
he
ad
here
mr
mcconnel
wa
talk
in
the
highland
to
teenag
and
everi
word
he
said
wa
put
out
on
a
webcast
by
the
scottish
execut
and
then
look
at
by
other
politician
and
report
i
think
in
thi
instanc
he
ha
done
a
lot
of
realli
good
thing
and
he
will
be
regret
thi
remark
the
scottish
nation
parti
holyrood
leader
nicola
sturgeon
wrote
to
mr
mcconnel
on
tuesday
accus
him
of
an
error
of
judgement
and
call
for
him
to
apologis
for
hi
illjudg
comment
and
withdraw
it
immedi
in
a
furiou
respons
the
first
minist
said
hi
comment
had
been
distort
and
taken
out
of
context
he
told
m
sturgeon
it
is
disappoint
that
you
have
contribut
to
thi
distort
by
say
it
is
stagger
that
i
should
encourag
young
peopl
to
get
drunk
that
is
complet
untru
perhap
it
would
have
been
wiser
for
you
to
find
out
what
wa
actual
said
befor
you
rush
to
repres
my
posit
undermin
the
conven
of
educ
at
highland
council
and
insult
the
intellig
of
the
young
peopl
i
spoke
with
all
for
the
sake
of
a
simpl
soundbit
