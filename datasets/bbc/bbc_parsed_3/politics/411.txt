i
have
to
say
i
dont
understand
what
they
are
do
the
labour

appear
to
be
in
some
kind
of
state
of
shock
it
doesnt
seem
to
know
what
to
do
a
few
week
of
posit
headlin
have
also
done
wonder
for
torus
activist
moral
like
to
be
a
crucial
factor
at
an
elect
which
most
analyst
seem
to
agre
will
hing
on
which
parti
can
get
their
core
support
out
it
ha
been
a
fantast
few
week
said
yearold
polit
student
nick
vaughan
our
polici
have
been
get
in
the
medium
and
there
is
a
sen
that
we
can
win
i
wouldnt
be
here
if
i
didnt
think
we
could
some
deleg
even
spoke
of
the
next

be
like
when
ted

on

much
of
the
credit
for
the
