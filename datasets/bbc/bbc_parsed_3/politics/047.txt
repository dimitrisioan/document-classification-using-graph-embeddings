said
some
student
could
be
appli
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
possibl
increas
in
annual
fee
at
english
univers
but
thi
wa
not
a
major
factor
he
told
bbc
radio
scotland
good
morn
scotland
programm
the
reason
peopl
are
opt
for
scottish
univers
is
that
they
are
perceiv
a
be
of
veri
high
qualiti
they
offer
veri
attract
cours
and
scotland
is
seen
a
a
veri
attract
place
to
studi
they
know
that
when
they
take
up
their
studi
in
they
will
be
hit
by
topup
fee
if
they
are
go
to
a
univers
in
england
and
that
may
be
part
of
the
reason
whi
the
number
come
to
scotland
are
so
inflat
howev
it
doe
not
mean
that
we
will
see
thousand
of
addit
student
from
england
studi
here
mr
wallac
agre
and
said
the
figur
had
to
be
look
at
in
context
he
explain
that
when
applic
were
translat
into
accept
the
number
wa
not
huge
an
addit
figur
of
about
also
the
pictur
wa
further
blur
by
the
fact
that
applic
from
wale
where
there
are
no
plan
for
topup
fee
have
also
risen
by
mr
wallac
said
accept
student
from
all
part
of
the
world
doe
show
the
high
regard
in
which
scottish
higher
educ
is
held
not
just
in
britain
we
want
to
make
sure
that
when
student
are
make
their
choic
they
do
so
on
the
natur
of
the
cours
and
not
becaus
they
are
under
some
sort
of
financi
pressur
to
go
to
scotland
we
do
not
want
to
have
a
situat
where
it
becom
imposs
for
scottish
student
to
get
place
at
scottish
univers
becaus
we
are
seen
a
the
cheap
option
veri
often
the
qualiti
of
the
univers
experi
is
enhanc
by
the
fact
there
are
student
come
from
a
wide
rang
of
background
so
it
would
be
wrong
to
go
the
other
way
and
start
exclud
student
