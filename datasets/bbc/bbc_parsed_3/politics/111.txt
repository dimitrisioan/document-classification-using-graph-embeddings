he

remark
abil
to

sadli
after

european
elect
it
becam
clear
that

wa
more
interest
in
the
robert
kilroysilk
parti
than
the
uk
independ
parti
so
it
wa
nice
know
him
now
goodby
he
said
ukip
offici
also
argu
mr
kilroysilk
ha
not
been
straightforward
in
attack
the
parti
he
onc
want
to
lead
thi
is
just
what
the
europhil
pray
for
a
the
main
euroscept
parti
ukip
should
tri
to
resolv
it
differ
with
kilroy
to
show
a
unit
front
and
give
the
uk
public
a
seriou
polit
voic
against
europ
have
multipl
parti
with
the
same
view
point
just
split
the
vote
further
thank
good
that
kilroysilk
ha
gone
now
ukip
at
least
ha
a
chanc
in
the
elect
it
is
veri
sad
to
see
the
caus
of
britain
regain
it
proper
relationship
with
europ
damag
by
thi
split
within
ukip
robert
kilroysilk
could
have
a
lot
to
offer
instead
we
have
a
split
parti
and
a
damag
caus
under
the
present
elector
system
peopl
must
work
togeth
and
small
parti
have
no
hope
of
represent
last
summer
ukip
achiev
a
major
advanc
partli
and
onli
partli
due
to
kilroysilk
it
is
a
great
shame
thi
ha
been
dissip
in
infight
ukip
ha
a
wide
platform
of
polici
not
just
withdraw
from
the
eu
thi
kilroysilk
conveni
ignor
in
the
comment
surround
the
launch
of
hi
own
parti
neither
the
english
democrat
nor
the
new
parti
were
interest
in
let
him
join
them
and
take
over
their
leadership
speak
volum
verita
is
the
begin
of
the
end
for
kilroysilk
if
he
belief
in
truth
and
democraci
then
he
and
the
two
assembl
member
should
resign
and
forc
a
byelect
to
stand
on
their
own
platform
rather
than
thi
backdoor
approach
to
polit
of
be
elect
for
one
parti
then
defect
to
anoth
so
ukip
wa
good
enough
for
him
to
lead
not
good
enough
for
him
to
follow
interest
that
a
parti
commit
to
plain
speak
should
have
a
latin
name
everi
opinion
poll
point
to
an
overwhelm
antieurop
feel
in
thi
countri
kilroysilk
could
be
on
the
verg
of
someth
huge
if
he
can
broaden
hi
appeal
beyond
thi
one
issu
he
is
an
extrem
abl
commun
with
year
of
polit
experi
we
want
qualiti
school
top
hospit
clean
and
effici
public
transport
punish
that
fit
the
crime
limit
asylum
a
purg
on
bureaucraci
and
le
tax
it
need
courag
and
honesti
two
qualiti
sadli
lack
in
our
politician
kilroysilk
may
just
have
those
veri
qualiti
recruit
the
right
colleagu
robert
and
your
time
may
have
come
well
if
you
can
not
get
enough
limelight
be
an
ordinari
mp
then
go
out
and
start
up
your
own
parti
it
all
flash
and
no
real
polici
here
let
hope
thi
is
the
start
of
both
ukip
and
kilroysilk
slip
into
obscur
verita
the
name
will
doom
it
but
perhap
i
am
wrong
for
sure
all
modern
schoolchildren
will
understand
it
sinc
they
do
still
learn
latin
in
the
classroom
do
they
not
the
whole
essenc
of
what
rk
repres
is
eurosceptic
so
explain
to
me
how
the
tootwe
label
of
verita
symbolis
that
