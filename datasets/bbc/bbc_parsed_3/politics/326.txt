ha
no
doubt
it
is
the
prime
minist
who
he
claim
is
ram
through
parliament
the
controversi
new
antiterror
measur
without
proper
debat
he
didnt
say
so
but
the
tori
believ
the
prime
minist
is
play
the
fear
card
on
thi
one
so
he
can
look
tough
in
the
run
up
to
the

they
believ
toni

use
the
issu
to
suggest
the

on
terror
whi
on
earth
will
the
prime
minist

take
up
the

offer
to
extend
the
exist
power
temporarili
to
allow
proper
parliamentari
debat

indic
that
it
is
the
tori
who

would
be
pointless
what
thi

opportun
to
embarrass
