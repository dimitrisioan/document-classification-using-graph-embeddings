here
is
how

weve
call
for

pension
to
be
increas
from

to
the
pension
credit
guarante
level
of
â£
that
what
were
call
for
mani
pension
are
disadvantag
by
the
current
system
if
weve
got
one
in
five
pension
below
the
poverti
line
weve
got
to
make
it
more
gener
or
have
these
peopl
live
in
poverti
weve
drawn
up
a
pension
manifesto
thi
will
be
sent
to
each
of
the
candid
in
the

they
will
be
ask
which
of
the
top
five

issu
they
would
support
onc
weve
got
their
respons
we
will
publish
the
result
within
the
constitu
and
nation
a
well
it
our
way
of
put
the
politician
on
notic
we
are
tri
to
get
across
the
fact
that
there
are
m
voter
over
in
the
countri
they
are
more
like
to
vote
than
other
section
of
societi
and
thirdli
they
are
true
swing
voter
befor
most
pension
vote
conserv
in
and
they
vote
labour
but
there
is
no
guarante
they
will
vote
for
a
labour
govern
thi
time
around
they
can
not
take
that
vote
for
grant
pension
gener
will
certainli
be
a
big
elect
issu
even
though
the
govern
ha
postpon
the
public
of
adair
turner
full
report
into
the
issu
he
said
the
uk
had
one
of
the
least
gener
pension
system
in
the
develop
world
that
the
govern
take
serious
the
impact
of
aviat
on
the
environ
we
havent
work
out
specif
plan
but
i
imagin
we
will
lobbi
polit
parti
and
incumb
mp
variou
local
group
will
do
that
in
their
particular
area
and
we
will
provid
a
nation
brief
we
dont
have
ani
larg
demonstr
plan
but
they
cant
be
rule
out
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
we
will
be
success
we
have
got
the
issu
in
the
public
conscious
to
an
extent
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
an
elect
will
rais
it
import
in
the
public
mind
or
whether
it
will
be
push
out
by
big
issu
like
iraq
repeal
the
hunt
bill
we
are
challeng
the
use
of
the
parliament
act
in
a
high
court
action
we
are
hope
to
hear
in
the
new
year
whichev
way
the
court
rule
the
other
side
will
appeal
so
we
expect
it
to
fall
plumb
in
election
time
when
the
ban
come
into
forc
on
februari
we
will
be
go
to
the
european
court
becaus
no
compens
is
be
paid
so
there
a
lot
of
legal
territori
to
go
we
are
tri
to
engag
with
the
minist
by
demonstr
and
talk
whatev
intellig
we
get
we
will
tri
to
turn
up
and
speak
to
whoever
it
is
rural
affair
minist
alun
michael
ha
avoid
u
and
cancel
engag
so
that
make
it
difficult
it
is
not
intimidatori
on
the
whole
it
is
group
of
angri
housew
of
cours
there
is
an
element
of
shout
becaus
peopl
are
angri
but
there
is
no
violenc
becaus
that
doe
not
achiev
anyth
it
will
fall
plumb
in
the
run
up
to
the
most
import
gener
elect
toni
blair
will
ever
face
it
exactli
what
the
prime
minist
did
not
want
he
want
the
issu
off
the
tabl
until
after
the
elect
peopl
use
live
anim
a
target
for
sport
both
here
and
abroad
the
reason
for
includ
abroad
is
becaus
of
trophi
hunt
it
is
anoth
sort
of
form
of
shoot
for
sport
the
principl
is
the
same
whether
it
a
tiger
or
a
pheasant
we
will
wide
publicis
what
happen
in
relat
to
trophi
hunt
we
will
publicis
the
darker
aspect
of
the
target
anim
industri
the
uk
we
will
seek
to
get
pledg
from
individu
mp
and
wouldb
mp
say
that
they
are
against
the
use
of
anim
a
target
for
sport
we
would
like
the
support
of
polit
parti
but
i
think
a
gener
elect
is
veri
much
to
do
with
pledg
mp
make
to
their
elector
with
hunt
we
had
mani
mp
who
were
happi
to
say
they
were
against
it
i
think
what
we
will
get
is
a
veri
real
climb
up
the
agenda
whether
or
not
we
will
get
a
ban
i
am
not
sure
but
it
will
mobilis
public
opinion
everyth
we
do
will
reduc
anim
suffer
and
in
time
that
will
lead
to
a
ban
the
issu
that
we
think
is
the
most
import
for
thi
elect
is
choic
the
languag
of
consumer
is
veri
commonplac
in
govern
and
across
the
polit
spectrum
choic
a
an
ideolog
is
begin
to
be
the
privatis
of
thi
decad
it
becom
an
issu
in
itself
but
what
realli
miss
from
the
debat
is
the
consum
choic
in
that
choic
is
not
choic
at
all
if
all
you
have
to
choos
from
is
two
fail
school
we
have
seen
so
mani
pension
missel
scandal
and
in
the
pension
industri
there
a
maximum
of
choic
but
a
minimum
qualiti
in
that
we
want
choic
on
the
consum
term
that
mean
clear
and
access
inform
to
oper
that
choic
firstli
we
have
our
websit
it
featur
our
campaign
and
chang
everi
day
secondli
through
our
member
who
commun
with
u
thirdli
through
the
medium
and
also
what
we
will
be
do
is
hold
a
preelect
confer
we
will
invit
the
opinion
former
mp
journalist
and
other
the
idea
is
that
we
open
up
commun
between
member
of
the
public
and
the
politician
i
think
we
will
be
success
it
veri
much
the
languag
be
use
by
the
main
polit
parti
politician
on
all
side
are
veri
sensit
to
thi
issu
they
want
to
be

to

fuel

there

i
would
not

if
