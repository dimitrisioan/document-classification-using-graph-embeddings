immigr
and

have

issu
politician
from
the
big

have
tipto
around
at
elect
time
but
no
longer
both
labour
and
the
torus
have
signal
their
intent
of
make
them
central
to
their
elect
campaign
they
have
been
struck
by
the
level
of
concern
amongst
voter
about
the

with
intern
survey
show
they
have
the
potenti
to
swing

that
wa
also
true

either

of

but
thi
time
around
it
look
set
to
be
one
of
the
core
battleground
with
both
the

compet
to
set
out

the

a

too

the

enter
the

the
liber

have
not
been
drawn
too
deepli
into
the
argument
but
have
call
for
a
europewid
polici
on

but
while
all
the

appear
to
agre
the
time
ha
come
to
properli
debat
and
address
the
issu
there
are
alreadi
sign
they
will
run
into
precis
the
same
problem
a
befor
former
union
leader
sir
bill
morri
ha
alreadi
accus
both
the
big
parti
of
engag
in
a
bid
war
about
who
can
be
nastiest
to
asylum
seeker
my
concern
is
that
whilst
the
labour
parti
and
the
conserv
parti
will
take
a
construct
approach
to
the
debat
rightw
polit
parti
pick
up
on
statement
like
burden
to
britain
will
exploit
thi
and
creat
a
lot
of
fear
and
uncertainti
it
is
precis
that
concern
and
the
possibl
suggest
the
issu
is
play
to
the
far
right
racist
agenda
that
will
provok
strong
reaction
from
mani
concern
with
thi
issu
the
challeng
for
the
big
parti
is
to
ensur
they
can
engag
in
the
debat
dure
the
cut
and
thrust
of
a
gener
elect
while
also
avoid
that
trap
