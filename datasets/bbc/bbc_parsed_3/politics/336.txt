issu
abov

the
impact
of
the

in

peopl
from

key
role

with
it
appeal
to
core
labour
valu
on
social
justic
health
and
educ
there
wa
real
passion
i
think
we
have
all
felt
a
littl
jade
but
it
remind
u
whi
we
join
the
parti
in
the
first
place
said
mr

have
walk
off

still
be
clap
ad
mr

but
for
everi
brownit
at
the
spring
confer
there
wa
an
equal
ardent
fan
of
mr
blair
stephen
dougla
from
wale
said
after
the

ha
had
on
some
issu
the
guy
still
ha
it

again
katrina

parliamentari
candid
said
mr
blair
had
shown
he
could
rous
the
parti
grassroot
i
think
if
everi
voter
wa
abl
to
spend
time
in
a
room
with
toni
the
way
we
have
today
we
will
have
no
problem
with
turnout
she
had
just
emerg
from
a
qa
session
in
which
mr
blair
tieless
and
suprem
at
eas
answer
question
pose
via
the
parti
websit
a
parti
of
councillor
from
nottingham
agre
that
there
wa
noth
wrong
with
mr
blair
leadership
and
they
were
adam
that
the
campaign
strength
of
the
parti
in
their
citi
wa
a
strong
a
ever
iraq
they
insist
would
not
be
a
factor
for
most
voter
the
biggest
problem
we
have
got
at
the
moment
is
that
we
keep
get
all
these
poll
say
we
are
go
to
run
away
with
the
elect
it
might
sound
great
but
it
doe
creat
thi
sens
of
complac
among
our
own
voter
and
i
think
that
is
the
greater
problem
than
iraq
said
nottingham
citi
councillor
brian
parbutt
and
even
mr
blair
most
vocal
critic
seem
to
agre
on
