tell

of
hi
person
respons
to
the
move
there
is
a
mortal
danger
aim
at
the
heart
of
britain
or
so
say
home
secretari
charl
clark
my
reaction
so
what
it
is
not
that
i
am
cynic
or
just
do
not
care
i
care
about
thi
countri
veri
much
but
in
the
year
that
i
have
been
aliv
there
ha
not
been
one
hour
of
one
day
of
one
month
of
one
year
when
there
ha
not
been
a
threat
aim
at
u
my
point
is
the
british
have
alway
cope
without
becom
a
dictatorship
we
have
cope
with
fear
without
becom
a
state
base
on
fear
we
have
cope
with
threat
without
turn
our
countri
into
a
land
of
state
threat
but
that
is
what
the
blair
govern
now
seek
to
do
creat
a
tyranni
to
defend
u
from

the

the

are
not

to

neither
were
the

but
we
did
and
without

now
the
blair

propos
the

system
of

commun
the

can
be

held
without

not
even
on

consider
of

judg
but
the
whim
of
a
polit
activist
call
a
govern
minist
to
be
protect
from
terror
the
govern
say
we
must
becom
a
tyranni
but
a
tyranni
is
base
on
the
citizen
terror
thi
is
not
victori
thi
is
defeat
befor
a
shot
is
fire
an
interest
articl
it
good
to
see
widen
particip
in
the
debat
but
i
suggest
we
move
one
step
further
our
own
bomb
and
bullet
will
can
onli
shatter
peac
becaus
invad
foreign
nation
imprison
the
innoc
and
hunt
in
the
shadow
can
not
destroy
an
evil
of
the
mind
and
hatr
within
the
heart
rather
than
focus
upon
effect
we
should
consid
the
caus
becaus
terror
doe
not
begin
with
bomb
whi
not
tri
a
foreign
polici
of
compass
it
can
onli
enhanc
our
democraci
and
share
our
freedom
i
agre
with
frederick
forsyth
we
realli
cant
deal
with
terror
by
turn
britain
into
a
fascist
state
what
we
realli
need
is
more
honesti
from
our
secur
servic
and
our
politician
if
they
do
not
have
evid
to
bring
these
peopl
to
trial
there
probabl
isnt
ani
our
secur
servic
behav
like
the
detect
who
have
decid
that
a

is
guilti
rake
over

flimsi
evid
to

and
prove
it
while
the
real
villain
get
away
rememb
there
were
no

just
becaus
a

may
have
made
some
stupid
and
naiv
decis
in

doe
not
make
them
a
terrorist
in
thi
overli
polit
correct
societi
it
is
good
to
see
someon
like
mr
forsyth
speak
out
ye
there
ha
been
oppress
by
the
british
govern
in
the
past
and
overstep
the
mark
in
place
like
ireland
but
ye
we
are
still
a
democraci
where
it
is
rare
to
be
arrest
without
chargetri
etc
apart
from
a
number
of

the

you
can

terror
peopl
die
in

the

today
is
that

a

will
flatten
a

a

of

will

you
now
have
a
combin
of
peopl
who
will
perform
terrorist
act
with
technolog
that
is
rapidli
becom
access
i
agre
the
govern
is
probabl
encourag
a
degre
of
masshysteria
and
talk
up
the
threat
but
talkingdown
the
threat
and
do
noth
is
unaccept
too
the
problem
with
thi
issu
is
not
that
it
isnt
import
but
the
fact
that
in
gener
we
brit
can
be
so
polit
apathet
some
time
that
we
will
just
let
thi
go
without
tell
the
govern
no
howev
a
the
nation
that
gave
the
world
the
common
law
and
a
true
sen
of
the
right
of
individu
liberti
i
hope
thi
will
prove
to
be
one
step
too
far
a
somebodi
of
chine
origin
i
can
say
that
thi
countri
use
to
be
a
good
place
to
migrat
and
start
a
new
life
whilst
life
wasnt
perfect
we
could
make
better
for
ourselv
now
we
are
riddl
with
red
tape
and
be
told
what
we
can
or
can
not
do
we
have
to
be
politicallycorrect
and
we
are
not
allow
to
have
belief
or
opinion
we
have
a
prime
minist
who
spend
too
much
time
meddl
in
u
polit
and
affair
which
have
littl
to
do
with
the
live
of
british
citizen
at
home
or
abroad
mr
forsyth
ha
done
a
good
job
in
voic
hi
opinion
let
hope
the
bbc
doesnt
get
gag
for
let
peopl
express
their
view
the
peopl
have
the
right
to
know
and
the
bbc
role
is
to
inform
educ
and
entertain
i
agre
terrorist
intend
to
spread
fear
but
in
realiti
it
is
the
govern
which
ha
spread
the
fear
by
it
constant
publicis
of
the
thi
invis
enemi
so
danger
that
we
must
allow
them
to
ride
roughshod
over
our
right
and
liberti
in
the
end
the
veri
thing
we
seek
to
protect
is
what
we
are
give
up
in
the
name
of
safeti
from
thi
invis
enemi
the
terrorist
have
alreadi
won
i
absolut
agre
with
frederick
forsyth
ye
we
have
to
defend
ourselv
against
terror
but
exist
law
seem
to
be
more
than
adequ
the
idea
that
the
new
terror
demand
new
power
is
erron
the
evid
of
ani
real
terrorist
capabl
in
the
uk
is
scant
ricin
for
exampl
is
a
danger
poison
but
it
is
not
a
weapon
of
mass
destruct
what
is
realli
worri
is
the
enthusiasm
of
mr
blair
and
hi
govern
for
authoritarian
reaction
and
attempt
to
manipul
the
elector
through
fear
if
the
govern
ha
it
way
with
id
card
track
and
so
on
then
totalitarian
ha
won
and
a
such
it
then
matter
littl
whether
we
give
in
to
the
terrorist
demand
or
not
we
will
have
lost
the
preciou
freedom
which
bush
and
blair
constantli
tell
u
we
have
and
that
they
seek
to
bring
to
other
i
agre
wholeheartedli
with
mr
forsyth
i
am
shock
at
the
ea
with
which
thi
govern
is
prepar
to
wipe
out
a
major
portion
of
the
liberti
that
british
peopl
have
enjoy
for
centuri
the
right
not
to
be
depriv
of
our
liberti
without
a
trial
in
open
court
that
goe
right
back
to
magna

and
ordinari
peopl
have
spill
their
blood
to
enforc
that
right
against
govern
who
thought
they
knew
best
when
you
look
at
today
britain
you
realis
georg
orwel
wa
onli
wrong
about
one
thing
the
date
frederick

put
it
beauti
the
govern
is
seek
to
introduc
a
polic
state
the
new
power
of
home
intern
without
trial
follow
a
pattern
which
includ
the
introduct
of
surveil
via
compulsori
id
card
and
the
link
of
data
base
togeth
with
the
unbritish
idea
that
we
will
have
to
swear
allegi
to
the
state
at
the
age
of
year
we
are
sleepwalk
into
thi
wake
up
an

but
miss
two
crucial
fact
of
thi
new
threat
if
these
terrorist
acquir
weapon
of
mass
destruct
they
will
use
them
without
fear
of
mutual
assur
destruct
that
kept
the
cold
war
in
a
state
of
ten
balanc
these
peopl
will
use
devast
forc
against
u
without
fear
of
ani
consequ
the
terrorist
are
prepar
to
use
suicid
bomber
which
mean
they
could
kill
innoc
peopl
on
the
london
underground
and
we
could
do
veri
littl
to
stop
it
becaus
these
terrorist
are
potenti
so
deadli
we
have
to
come
up
with
new
tougher
respons
it
will
be
a
littl
late
in
the
day
when
peopl
outsid
london
wake
up
one
morn
to
find
out
that
london
ha
been
nuke
we
wont
have
much
of
a
societi
left
to
debat
he
correct
in
most
of
what
he
say
mind
you
he
doe
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
disgrac
intern
polici
in
northern
ireland
which
probabl
caus
mani
idealist
if
misguid
young
cathol
to
join
the
ira
administr
detent
of
muslim
could
have
a
similar
effect
now
sure
we
the
public
would
be
better
protect
if
the
secur
servic
rather
than
alert
a
suspect
terrorist
by
place
them
under
hous
arrest
and
for
how
longthey
were
to
place
suspect
terrorist
under
surveil
and
mayb
acquir
suffici
evid
to
prosecut
or
even
better
prevent
a
terrorist
attack
i
dont
usual
have
much
time
for
mr
forsyth
larg
right
wing
view
but
thi
time
he
ha
got
it
spot
on
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
terrorist
organis
who
would
like
to
do
harm
to
the
uk
but
it
is
veri
doubt
whether
alqaeda
is
a
global
organis
coordin
thi
the
rise
of
surveil
camera
id
card
the
plan
to
charg
for
road
use
by
track
everi
vehicl
at
all
time
thi
is
the
stuff
of
nightmar
add
to
thi
thi
new
legisl
which
effect
mean
that
the
protect
of
the
law
will
be
remov
from
anyon
at
the
whim
of
the
home
secretari
and
i
genuin
wonder
what
sort
of
world
my
two
child
will
inherit
where
will
thi
end
a
it
stand
terrorist
do
not
need
to
attack
the
uk
it
govern
will
soon
have
it
peopl
terroris
more
that
they
could
veri
achiev
with
a
few
bomb
mr
forsyth
ha
express
exactli
what
my
gut
fear
and
reserv
were
about
thi
propos
legisl
but
could
not
verbalis
thank
you
mr
forsyth
seem
to
forget
that
kill
in
the
troubl
occur
on
both
side
of
the
religi
divid
and
wa
carri
out
by
killer
from
both
side
he
also
forget
basic
human
right
were
suspend
then
a
now
experienc
judg
sat
over
some
of
the
greatest
miscarriag
of
justic
dure
those
time
for
veri
littl
return
and
maximum
alien
these
law
and
the
emphasi
on
the
islam
threat
will
just
do
the
same
forsyth
is
wrong
the
natur
of
the
current
threat
is
new
it
is
no
longer
to
our
arm
forc
a
the
soviet
threat
in
the
eastern
bloc
wa
it
is
to
you
and
i
the
terrorist
aim
to
kill
indiscrimin
the
best
comparison
is
therefor
the
blitz
at
thi
time
let
u
not
forget
suspect
foreign
and
british
were
routin
round
up
and
intern
for
the
durat
of
the
war
without
ani
complaint
from
the
public
we
must
not
forget
we
are
at
war
id
say
that
that
the
likelihood
of
an
attack
by
a
sleeper
cell
of
fundamentalist
lunat
against
a
major
uk
target
is
a
when
not
an
if
probabl
ill
bet
ani
money
you
like
that
the
day
after
ani
such
attack
freddi
forsyth
will
be
say
that
the
govern
didnt
do
enough
to
protect
the
uk
peopl
like
forsyth
can
onli
see
one
side
of
ani
argument
and
for
him
it
is
the
side
that
is
opposit
new
labour
and
toni
blair
i
agre
wholeheartedli
with
mr
forsyth
the
veri
reason
thi
countri
ha
been
such
a
wonder
place
to
live
is
under
attack
not
from
terrorist
but
from
thi
govern
the
perpetu
of
the
perceiv
terrorist
threat
is
not
becaus
of
what
the
alleg
terrorist
are
do
but
from
our
own
govern
i
believ
what
thi
govern
is
do
is
at
the
veri
least
highli
question
and
at
worst
sinist
at
what
point
will
they
feel
they
have
enough
control
over
everi
singl
person
in
the
british
isl
when
we
are
all
tag
and
monitor
constantli
our
freedom
is
be
craftili
and
surreptiti
whittl
away
by
thi
govern
and
we
are
gain
noth
it
should
be
of
great
concern
to
everyon
i
am
slightli
older
than
mr
forsyth
and
therefor
have
live
through
the
same
histori
a
him
i
am
against
a
polic
state
and
would
not
like
to
think
that
i
live
in
one
i
think
that
the
attack
on
iraq
made
the
intern
situat
wors
and
may
have
provok
further
act
of
terror
how
true
there
are
extrem
worri
parallel
between
britain
now
and
germani
dure
the
s
i
never
thought
it
would
be
so
easi
to
take
over
a
countri
from
within
mr
forsyth
ha
forgotten
one
key
point
the
terrorist
who
threaten
britain
today
are
well
awar
that
hitler
stalin
and
the
ira
all
fail
a
a
result
modern
day
terrorist
are
will
to
do
thing
their
predecessor
did
not
that
doe
not
mean
that
the
civil
liberti
of
modern
britain
must
be
erod
to
counter
the
threat
that
should
alway
be
the
absolut
last
resort
but
to
meet
the
new
threat
to
defeat
the
sinist
fanatic
of
today
terrorist
we
may
need
to
do
thing
a
littl
differ
let
u
hope
not
freder
forsyth
comment
seem
to
me
to
be
a
wellthoughtout
analysi
of
whi
we
human
societi
a
a
whole
and
britain
in
particular
should
resist
the
temptat
to
overprotect
through
fear
it
is
thi
fear
which
enabl
terrorist
to
succeed
in
the
end
and
terrorist
can
come
in
all
form
a
mr
forsyth
open
comment
suggest
i
am
remind
of
a
quot
attribut
to
thoma
jefferson
a
nation
that
limit
freedom
in
the
name
of
secur
will
have
neither
the
govern
are
face
with
an
incred
difficult
task
and
have
made
a
polici
to
deal
with
it
it
all
veri
well
criticis
that
polici
but
if
mr
forsyth
cant
draw
on
hi
year
of
experi
to
offer
an
altern
i
say
so
what
to
hi
opinion
frederick
forsyth
rhetor
is
absurd
and
hi
conclus
laughabl
he
distort
realiti
to
serv
hi
own
prejudic
against
new
labour
thi
govern
seek
to
balanc
protect
of
our
democraci
with
minimum
loss
of
civil
right
it
is
frederick
forsyth
who
is
the
extremist
becaus
he
doe
not
appreci
the
need
for
balanc
i
rare
find
myself
agre
with
my
forsyth
but
in
thi
instanc
i
think
he
is
correct
the
rule
of
law
must
prevail
civil
liberti
are
worth
defend
if
the
govern
can
hold
suspect
without
charg
or
trial
what
next
i
agre
absolut
by
introduc
fascist
type
law
we
loo
the
moral
high
ground
in
our
fight
against
terror
our
democrat
system
is
not
perfect
but
a
churchil
point
out
it
is
better
than
all
the
other
that
have
been
tri
terrorist
attack
will
take
place
but
for
mani
reason
we
should
take
that
person
risk
in
return
for
person
freedom
i
do
not
usual
agre
with
mr
forsyth
but
he
is
spot
on
here
the
singl
biggest
threat
we
face
is
that
of
a
govern
dedic
to
act
illeg
and
manipul
intern
and
nation
law
to
suit
it
own
purpos
totalitarian
alway
requir
an
outsid
threat
justifi
a
rang
of
extraordinari
power
leader
want
the
british
govern
is
a
far
greater
threat
that
and
terrorist
organis
although
in
principl
i
agre
with
him
frederick
forsyth
fail
to
address
one
key
point
alqaeda
attack
though
obvious
there
have
been
none
yet
in
the
uk
seek
to
kill
the
maximum
number
of
peopl
the
ira
want
to
limit
the
death
toll
of
their
attack
so
a
to
maintain
support
among
the
republican
movement
ye
i
agre
with
mr
forsyth
view
i
do
not
believ
the
govern
plan
are
justifi
there
is
over
reaction
to
and
the
neg
influenc
of
the
u
presid
interpret
of
democraci
and
freedom
he
use
the
same
argument
that
were
current
befor
the
wwii
the
war
to
liber
iraq
afghanistan
with
syria
and
iran
to
come
we
are
leav
a
poor
inherit
for
the
futur
gener
mr
forsyth
is
a
wonder
writer
and
should
keep
hi
fiction
where
it
belong
the
british
govern
is
not
go
down
the
road
that
mr
forsyth
suggest
sadli
comment
such
a
hi
will
make
a
lot
of
peopl
believ
that
they
are
govern
by
peopl
who
are
fast
becom
tyrant
instead
of
be
genuin
commit
to
stop
tyranni
even
if
the
method
employ
to
do
that
is
at
the
moment
alien
to
the
british
peopl
who
have
live
in
a
democraci
protect
by
toni
blair
and
other
of
like
mind
who
mr
forsyth
seem
to
be
put
along
side
the
scruffi
littl
austrian
thoma
hobb
would
be
smile
in
hi
grave
at
labour
proposit
like
new
labour
he
call
himself
a
libertarian
like
new
labour
he
believ
he
wa
promot
the
peopl
best
interest
but
a
forsyth
criticis
thi
govern
hobb
ha
been
criticis
by
most
subsequ
philosoph
for
argu
hi
way
into
the
hand
of
the
totalitarian
simpli
put
he
argu
that
in
favour
of
the
ultim
liberti
the
liberti
to
live
man
should
be
prepar
to
surrend
all
other
liberti
to
a
suprem
sovereign
a
protect
against
hi
fellow
barbar
man
hobb
ha
been
roundli
condemn
by
poster
and
rightli
so
i
hope
new
labour
suffer
the
same
treatment
i
agre
with
mr
forsyth
view
the
govern
approach
is
total
against
the
spirit
of
british
democraci
they
must
not
be
allow
to
get
away
with
it
of
cours
frederick
is
wrong
about
britain
win
the
war
against
the
ira
and
he
wrong
too
about
the
countri
not
becom
a
tyranni
ha
he
forgotten
about
shoot
to
kill
tortur
intern
without
trial
collus
with
loyalist
death
squad
etc
my
background
is
somewhat
similar
to
freddi
so
i
am
persuad
to
agre
with
mani
of
hi
sentiment
we
can
have
no
moral
justif
for
impos
our
system
of
govern
on
anyon
while
we
are
systemat
depriv
our
own
citizen
of
basic
individu
and
collect
freedom
whilst
the
principl
of
keep
potenti
terrorist
under
hous
arrest
might
seem
superfici
attract
it
is
unfortun
also
the
first
step
toward
totalitarian
who
is
to
decid
whom
is
a
suspect
whi
should
we
believ
them
who
can
have
faith
in
the
honesti
integr
and
compet
of
our
intellig
servic
and
politician
in
light
of
the
event
of
recent
year
what
is
to
stop
fals
denunci
what
of
those
fals
accus
who
will
lose
their
career
who
will
support
their
famili
will
their
child
still
go
to
school
it
smack
to
me
of
the
method
of
nazi
germani
stalin
russia
ceausescu
romania
the
list
goe
on
it
look
a
if
a
new
dark
age
is
come
i
see
that
opinion
on
mr
forsyth
remark
are
divid
the
problem
i
see
is
that
those
who
support
imprison
without
trial
believ
it
will
never
happen
to
them
or
their
famili
onli
to
peopl
they
dont
like
or
are
scare
of
but
histori
ha
shown
that
if
you
have
law
like
that
they
alway
get
abus
by
those
in
power
after
all
today
you
may
be
scare
of
the
same
peopl
a
those
in
power
but
someday
those
in
power
may
be
scare
of
you
and
that
day
youll
be
the
one
imprison
without
the
chanc
of
justic
our
law
are
such
that
you
can
not
just
be
imprison
at
the
whim
of
our
polic
forc
you
have
to
be
shown
to
be
deserv
of
it
if
we
imprison
peopl
without
trial
for
an
indetermin
period
we
are
no
better
that
those
we
are
fight
i
never
thought
it
possibl
for
me
to
agre
with
a
singl
word
utter
by
frederick
forsyth
but
im
in
wholeheart
agreement
with
him
on
thi
one
we
a
a
nation
are
in
grave
danger
of
be
dupe
by
pro
u
propaganda
which
of
cours
also
mean
well
inherit
most
if
not
all
of
their
total
paranoia
and
allow
our
govern
of
ani
polit
persuas
incident
to
gradual
and
insidi
impos
a
polic
state
by
well
tri
test
back
door
method
i
griev
for
the
futur
of
my
child
it
no
wonder
theyr
adam
they
dont
ever
want
ani
of
their
own
thi
govern
with
much
fanfar
sign
u
up
to
the
european
convent
on
human
right
but
now
want
to
introduc
indefinit
hous
arrest
without
trial
thi
put
it
on
a
par
with
the
govern
of
burma
like
mani
of
your
respond
i
wouldnt
usual
think
of
mr
forsyth
a
someon
whose
view
i
share
but
in
the
instanc
of
oppos
charl
clark
propos
for
hous
arrest
i
agre
wholeheartedli
with
mr
forsyth
i
agre
with
mr
forsyth
just
look
at
the
fact
our
govern
along
with
the
u
invad
anoth
sovereign
countri
iraq
by
select
intellig
that
back
it

base
on
fear
the
fact
turn
out
to
be

differ
if

are

way
then
weve
done
ourselv
more
damag
than
ani
terrorist
organis
could
with

we
becom
anim
too
i
agre
in
mani
way
with
what
mr
forsyth
ha
said
if
we
are
to
be
respect
and
have
influenc
within
the
world
we
must
be
seen
to
be
walk
the

how
can

such
a

abus
when
we
are
lock
up
peopl
who
may
be

innoc
it
is
hypocrisi
of
the
highest
order
mr
forsyth
link
islam
fundament
to
the
new
threat
howev
it
appear
that
he
ha
misunderstood
the
term
islam
fundament
it
should
be
point
out
that
a
muslim
who
adher
to
the
true
fundament
of
the
quraan
and
the
teach
of
the
last
prophet
muhammad
is
an
islam
fundamentalist
thi

doe
not
commit

nor
doe
shehe
kill
innoc
woman
men
and

thi
person
is
selfreflect

constantli
tri
to
better
herhi
action
by
be
good
to
other
the
peopl
who
mr
forsyth
label
the
new
threat
are
those
who
do
not
follow
the
correct
teach
of
islam
they
have
arriv
at
their
own
interpret
and
assumpt
with
regard
their
action
on
top
of
that
they
claim
to
be
follow
islam
in
it
true
form
i
accept
that
the
intent
of
these
polici
are
to
make
britain
a
safer
place
but
i
can
not
think
of
