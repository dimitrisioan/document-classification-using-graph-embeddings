admit
hi
side
were
lucki
to

dure
thi

he
ad
we
have
had
to
play
two
match
in
three
day
which
is
foreign
to
mani
of
my
player
and
although
i
understand
the
tradit
of
footbal
here
at
thi
time
of
year
it
is
not
good
for
your
health
to
do
it
you
can
sit
back
and
smoke
cigar
one
after
anoth
and
it
is
a
good
life

it
is
not
actual
good
for
