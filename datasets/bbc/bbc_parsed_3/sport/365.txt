he
said
when
you
come
to
an
undertak
like
thi
and
you

tri
to
make
a
differ
then
there
are
alway
peopl

comment
that
the
nation

had
receiv
a
massiv
increas
in
budget
at
the
expens
of
other
part
of
scottish
rugbi
and
that
is
simpli
not
the
case
like
all
good
coach
you
go

ask
for
an
increas

we
were
told
in
no

did
not
allow

flounder
is
absolut
untru
we
also
attract
critic
becaus
of
the
number
of
day
player
spent
with

let
me
give
you
the
truth
our
irish
counterpart
whom
we
have
to
compet
with
in
a
few
day
time
had
day
togeth
at
the
summer
they
are
current
in
camp
now
and
they
will
have
anoth
day
in
camp
befor
the
six
nation
that
mean
they
will
have
day
away
from
their
club
from
juli
until
the
six
nation
we
on
the
other
hand
will
have
there
must
be
a
winwin
philosophi
and
attitud
within
scottish
rugbi
and
that
is
what
we
are
after
both
group
win
not
