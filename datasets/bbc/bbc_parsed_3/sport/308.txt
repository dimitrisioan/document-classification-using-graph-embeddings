henson
stake
earli
lion
claim
the
six
nation
may
be
a
glitter
prize
in
itself
but
everi
player
from
the
four
home
union
will
also
have
one
eye
on
a
possibl
trip
to
new
zealand
with
the
lion
thi
summer
the
player
who
stake
the
biggest
claim
for
a
place
in
the
start
xv
over
the
weekend
wa
gavin
henson
he
veri
confid
you
just
had
to
listen
to
hi
interview
afterward
he
beam
with
confid
but
although
there
an
element
of
arrog
it
good
arrog
he
certainli
show
some
nice
touch
he
onc
show
a
clean
pair
of
heel
to
mathew
tait
when
he
got
outsid
him
hi
defenc
wa
veri
good
and
he
made
some
great
kick
out
of
hand
and
that
without
even
mention
hi
majest
matchwin
penalti
but
i
think
we
need
to
wait
and
see
what
happen
becaus
he
need
to
be
put
to
the
test
he
need
to
come
up
against
brian
odriscol
or
a
big
french
midfield
wale
flyhalf
stephen
jone
wa
anoth
player
who
impress
me
he
gave
good
direct
he
wa
veri
confid
and
he
wa
a
nice
gener
for
hi
side
he
show
he
can
control
a
game
with
jonni
wilkinson
not
play
at
the
moment
due
to
inuri
the
number
shirt
could
be
up
for
grab
and
jone
or
mayb
even
henson
could
make
the
lion
team
at
flyhalf
jone
stuck
hi
hand
up
and
he
certainli
look
a
better
bet
than
charli
hodgson
after
saturday
game
some
of
the
wale
forward
surpris
me
becaus
i
thought
they
would
be
outmuscl
in
the
tight
five
england
prop
julian
white
is
a
capabl
player
but
when
it
come
down
to
select
gethin
jenkin
is
now
go
to
have
the
upper
hand
becaus
he
came
out
on
top
howev
i
still
think
white
and
phil
vickeri
will
be
in
the
frame
some
english
player
did
their
caus
no
harm
i
thought
joe
worsley
had
a
solid
game
and
jason
robinson
and
josh
lewsey
both
did
noth
wrong
but
it
look
too
soon
for
young
mathew
tait
and
i
think
it
will
be
a
while
befor
we
see
him
again
despit
be
written
off
beforehand
sever
scot
caught
my
eye
against
franc
tom
smith
ha
been
there
and
done
it
befor
but
the
like
of
chri
cusit
jason
white
and
alli
hogg
all
made
their
mark
hogg
made
a
coupl
of
good
run
while
white
had
a
pretti
robust
game
hi
defenc
is
right
up
there
cusit
look
veri
live
and
he
could
be
a
veri
good
option
for
lion
coach
sir
clive
woodward
the
star
of
ireland
win
over
itali
in
rome
look
like
a
certainti
to
make
the
start
xv
against
new
zealand
brian
odriscol
is
a
class
act
he
ran
some
good
line
against
itali
made
the
break
and
fed
hi
outsid
back
although
itali
defend
man
on
man
which
made
it
easi
for
him
gordon
darci
wa
unlucki
to
go
off
injur
earli
on
but
i
think
you
could
get
a
henson
darci
odriscol
combin
in
the
lion
midfield
paul
oconnel
just
need
to
add
a
hard
edg
to
hi
game
and
malcolm
okelli
keep
on
go
and
seem
to
be
put
hi
hand
up
while
shane
byrn
seem
to
be
a
live
charact
but
they
will
be
a
bit
worri
after
the
italian
pack
drove
them
off
their
own
ball
on
sunday
although
i
use
to
play
in
itali
and
i
know
how
difficult
it
can
be
one
player
who
didnt
impress
me
wa
wale
scrumhalf
dwayn
peel
he
choke
late
on
in
the
second
half
when
wale
were
trail
they
had
good
posse
and
he
kick
the
ball
away
i
wouldnt
want
him
a
my
lion
scrumhalf
after
that
