realli
not
import
i
want
to
see
u
win
away
match
in
the
champion
leagu
that
it
wa
in

wa
not
my
first
consider
a
far
a
i
am
concern
it
is
import
for
liverpool
to
win
it
is
not
import
in
what
countri
it
is
in
benitez
ad
benitez
said
we
had
a
problem
befor
the
start
it
wa
decid
that
xabi
could
not
play
more
than
minut
but
in
the
end
becaus
of
the
way
that
dietmar
hamann
and
igor
biscan
perform
we
did
not
need
to
chang
thing
until
right
at
the
end
of
the
match
depor
are
a
good
team
and
if
you
allow
them
to
keep
posse
they
can
be
veri
danger
inde
but
we
knew
that
if
we
hit
them
on
the
counterattack
it
would
make
them
nervou
and
that
is
how
it
work
out
deportivo
coach
javier
irureta
said
liverpool
play
veri
well
and
we
just
could
not
break
them
down
i
know
we
have
now
gone
six
game
at
home
in
europ
without
score
but
that
doe
not
reflect
our
overal
perform
but
thi
time
we
did
not
play
well
and
we
lack
imagin
the
goal
wa
a
bad
mistak
and
a
big
blow
to
our
confid
player
who
usual
want
the
ball
at
that
stage
did
not
want
it
i
know
we
are
bottom
of
the
group
but
a
long
a
there
is
hope
of
qualifi
we
will
hang
on
to
that
