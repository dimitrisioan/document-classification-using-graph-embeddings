coach
john

believ
hi
side
can
upset
england

the
six
nation
wooden
spoon
battl
hot
up
the
two
side
both
without
a
win
meet
on
march
at
twickenham
and
kirwan
say
hi
side
will
be
hope
to
make
the
most
of
england
current
slump
we
have
to
make
sure
the
england
and
franc
game
are
tough
for
them
england
have
not
been
have
the
best
of
championship
that
is
a
big
one
for
u
and
them
and
i
am
sure
my
player
will
rise
to
the
occas
he
said
but
kirwan
admit
that
a
lot
of
hard
work
will
be
need
with
hi
kicker
befor
the
trip
to
london
roland
de
marigni
and
luciano
orquera
had
a
miser
time
with
the
boot
in
the
dire
defeat
to
scotland
a
chri
paterson
stole
the
show
to
give
the
host
a
muchneed
victori
kirwan
said
the
kick
wa
the
decis
factor
in
scotland
which
cost
u
and
it
could
go
down
to
the
kick
again
next
time
but
i
have
a
lot
of
confid
in
my
player
and
i
am
posit
we
can
put
everyth
togeth
against
england
england
meanwhil
are
lick
their
wound
and
rue
what
might
have
been
had
two
decis
from
refere
jonathan
kaplan
not
gone
against
them
in
the
second
half
in
dublin
first

and
then
kaplan
opt
not
to
call
upon
video
evid
to
see
if
josh
lewsey
had
touch
down
after
be
driven
over
ireland
line
but
centr
jami
noon
believ
the
side
at
least
show
better
form
than
their
previou
two
defeat
we
definit
improv
against
an
inform
irish
side
he
said
we
went
to
dublin
quietli
confid
that
we
would
be
abl
to
compet
and
i
think
we
show
that
we
have
got
to
make
sure
we
now
take
the
form
and
posit
into
the
itali
game
we
are
under
no
illus
that
it
is
go
to
be
easi
but
we
definit
need
a
win
england
have
now
equal
an
year
low
of
four
