the
versatil
finnan
who
star

the
french
is
confid
the
group
is
ireland
for
the
take
there
is
a
chanc
for
u
now
to
go
on
win
our
home
game
and
whi
not
win
the
group
even
though
it
a
tough
one
said
the
liverpool

switzerland
ireland
franc
and
israel
are
all
now
tie
on
five
point
from
three
match
although
the
republ
look

have
a
slight
edg
after
claim
away
draw
in
basel
and
pari
in
basel
we
did
not
play
great
footbal
but
when
you
to
go
to
these
place
the
other
team
are
go
to
have
the
major
of
the
game
in
pari
we
look
good
throughout
the
team
and
a
point
wa
the
least
we
deserv
becaus
we
had
a
number
of
chanc
look
back
we
had
an
opportun
to
get
the
three
point
but
we
are
happi
with
a
point

that
will
give
u
confid

got
the
toughest
match
out
of
the
way
and
we
have
set
standard
for
ourselv
automat
qualif
is
there
