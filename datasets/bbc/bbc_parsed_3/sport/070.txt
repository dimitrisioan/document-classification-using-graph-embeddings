record
fail
to
lift
lacklustr
meet
yelena
isinbayeva
may
have
produc
anoth
world
pole
vault
record
but
her
achiev
could
not
hide
the
fact
it
wa
not
the
best
meet
we
have
ever
seen
in
birmingham
and
hey
there
are
not
mani
meet
that
go
by
without
the
russian
break
a
world
record
appar
isinbayeva
ha
clear
five
metr
in
train
and
i
would
just
love
her
to
put
u
out
of
our
miseri
and
have
a
go
at
it
rather
than
extend
the
indoor
record
by
one
centimetr
at
a
time
athlet
to
me
is
all
about
push
the
barrier
and
be
the
best
you
can
and
i
would
like
to
see
her
have
a
go
at
m
in
competit
mind
you
everi
time
she
break
the
record
she
get
so
she
can
afford
to
be
deliber
about
it
world
record
asid
i
thought
it
wa
a
veri
encourag
even
work
for
kelli
holm
she
look
good
and
wa
veri
posit
agn
samaria
who
came
second
is
in
veri
good
shape
and
is
in
the
world
top
three
m
runner
thi
season
ye
samaria
let
kelli
get
away
but
there
wa
no
come
back
over
the
last
m
a
kelli
domin
the
race
so
beat
samaria
is
a
bit
of
a
benchmark
for
kelli
my
gut
feel
is
that
kelli
would
like
to
run
in
the
european
indoor
championship
but
she
just
hasnt
convinc
herself
she
is
fit
enough
to
do
so
on
the
other
hand
i
think
jason
garden
is
struggl
to
come
near
what
is
go
to
be
requir
to
win
the
men
m
in
madrid
he
start
well
in
the
final
but
still
could
not
stay
with
the
frontrunn
jason
ha
a
lot
of
experi
indoor
but
for
some
reason
he
is
struggl
to
maintain
hi
pace
through
to
the
finish
it
would
have
been
nice
to
see
what
mark
lewisfr
could
have
done
in
the
final
if
onli
he
hadnt
got
himself
disqualifi
he
wa
blatantli
play
the
falsestart
game
to
hi
advantag
but
it
trip
him
up
and
made
him
look
a
bit
silli
my
view
is
your
meant
to
go
when
the
gun
goe
and
not
befor
and
if
you
tri
to
unsettl
your
rival
by
employ
the
falsestart
tactic
you
have
to
rememb
not
to
fals
start
yourself
again
have
said
that
mark
is
look
in
much
better
shape
but
i
havent
seen
anyth
from
mark
or
jason
yet
which
suggest
franc
ronald
pognon
who
ha
run
second
will
be
under
threat
at
the
european
from
a
british
point
of
view
sarah
claxton
victori
in
the
m
hurdl
wa
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
the
meet
someth
el
that
probabl
went
unnot
wa
melani
purkiss
win
the
woman
nation
m
race
in
a
new
person
best
of
second
aaa
champion
kim
wall
came
second
in
anoth
lifetim
best
so
we
have
a
veri
strong
xm
squad
go
to
the
european
championship
scotland
lee
mcconnel
is
probabl
go
to
run
too
so
we
have
a
real
prospect
of
a
medal
from
an
intern
perspect
i
thought
meseret
defar
wa
disappoint
in
the
m
but
i
dont
think
the
pacemak
wa
great
canadian
heather
hennigar
set
a
fast
earli
pace
but
could
not
maintain
it
and
if
jo
pavey
had
been
in
last
year
shape
she
would
have
given
defar
a
real
run
for
her
money
she
had
a
go
but
just
could
not
hang
in
there
we
were
also
expect
a
bit
more
from
bernard
lagat
in
the
men
m
but
he
ha
onli
just
come
over
from
the
usa
so
he
may
not
be
that
sharp
and
i
still
think
he
is
in
great
shape
a
for
kenenisa
bekel
he
wa
well
beaten
by
marko
geneti
but
we
onli
had
half
expect
for
bekel
a
he
ha
been
struggl
thi
season
it
wa
veri
hot
in
the
nation
indoor
arena
and
i
felt
uncomfort
in
the
commentari
box
i
think
those
condit
affect
the
distanc
runner
and
in
fact
defar
complain
to
her
coach
after
the
race
that
she
could
not
get
her
breath
