william
say
he
will
not
quit
a
scotland
coach
even
if
hi
side
slump
to
a
new
low
with
defeat
by
itali
at
murrayfield
that
would
leav
the
scot
a
favourit
to
win
the
wooden
spoon
for
the
second
year
run
i
have
never
quit
anyth
in
my
life
apart
from
mayb
paint
the
kitchen
he
told
bbc
sport
the
support
we
have
been
given
from
murrayfield
in
my
whole
time
here
ha
been
william
ha
yet
to
experi
an
rb
six
nation
victori
after
seven
attempt
and
scotland
have
lost
of
their
game
under
hi
leadership
but
he
reject
the
comparison
made
in
some
medium
sourc
with
berti
vogt
recent
sack
a
scotland
footbal
manag
after
a
poor
run
of
result
how
can
a
german
footbal
coach
and
an
australian
rugbi
coach
have
anyth
in
common
he
ask
it
is
a
bizarr
analog
it
is
so
absurd
that
it
border
on
the
humor
william
insist
that
he
is
revel
in
the
pressur
despit
the
possibl
of
a
second
six
nation
seri
without
a
victori
that
is
not
beyond
the
realm
of
possibl
he
admit
there
noth
much
between
the
team
so
we
could
win
the
next
three
game
or
lose
them
but
i
actual
realli
enjoy
see
how
you
cope
with
such
pressur
a
a
coach
it
help
the
team
grow
and
help
you
grow
a
a
coach
we
could
have
won
in
pari
but
for
the
last
five
minut
and
now
we
have
two
defeat
but
we
were
confid
for
those
two
first
game
and
we
are
confid
we
can
beat
itali
too
