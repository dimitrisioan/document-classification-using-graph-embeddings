charli
admit
the
davi

my
dream
and
i
wa
a
bit
nervou
at
the
outset
some
peopl
have
said
that
i
am
ob
but
i
think
that
it
is
better
thi
way
it
help
me
reach
my
goal

it
realli
incred
to

spanish
captain
jordi
arres
said
charli
play
a
great
game
it
wa
hi
opportun
and
he
hasnt
let
u
down
he
had
lost
three
time
to
roddick
and
thi
wa
hi
day
to
beat
him
he
had
been
wait
year
to
be
in
thi
posit
spain
victori
wa
also
remark
for
the
perform
of
rafael
nadal
who
beat
roddick
in
the
open
singl
age
year
and
day
the
mallorcan
becam
the
youngest
player
to
win
the
davi
cup
what
a
great
way
to
finish
the
year
said
nadal
afterward
u
coach
patrick
mcenro
want
roddick
and
the
rest
of
hi
team
to
play
more
tenni
on
clay
and
hone
their
skill
on
the
surfac
i
think
it
will
help
these
guy
even
on
slow
hard
court
to
learn
how
to
mix
thing
up
a
littl
bit
and
to
play
a
littl
bit
smarter
and
tactic
better
obvious
it
unrealist
to
say
that
were
go
to
just
start
play
constantli
on
clay
with
the
schedul
but
certainli
i
think
we
can
put
the
work
in
at
the
appropri
time
and
play
a
coupl
more
event
and
play
against
these
guy
who
are
the
best
on
thi
stuff
said
mcenro
roddick
wa
left
frustrat
after
lose
both
hi
singl
on
the
slow
clay
of
sevil
olymp
stadium
it
just
tough
becaus
i
felt
like
i
wa
in
it
the
whole
time
against
one
of
the
top
three
claycourt
in
the
world
said
the
american
i
had
my
chanc
and
just
didnt
convert
them
the
bottom
line
is
they
were
just
better
than
u
thi
weekend
they
came
out
took
care
of
busi
and
they
beat
u
it
a
simpl
