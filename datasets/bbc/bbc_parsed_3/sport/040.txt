she
is
certain

such
a
redempt
you
cant

warn
richard
onli
one
person
can
win

paula
ha
to
figur
out
what
sort
of
thing
will
she
feel
satisfi
achiev
by
the
end
of
the
race
the
cours
from
staten
island
to
central
park
is
renown
a
one
of
the
toughest
in
the
world
it
is
also
not
the
kind
of
fast
cours
that
tend
to
suit
radcliff
better
with
the
undul
finish
through
the
park
test
the
leg
final
reserv
radcliff
ha
never
race
there
befor
and
will
enter
the
unknown
just
day
after
the
athen
marathon
it
suggest
after
a
major
marathon
you
take
a
full
month
off
and
start
build
up
again
said
yell
herself
a
marathon
runner
but
that
is
onli
for
longterm
health
and
fit
when
you
finish
a
marathon
you
are
still
veri
fit
and
can
recov
quickli
so
physic
it
is
possibl
for
paula
richard
also
point
out
condit
in
new
york
will
be
more
conduc
to
a
strong
physic
display
from
radcliff
the
heat
stress
wa
the
primari
factor
that
trip
her
up
in
athen
he
said
and
that
just
isnt
go
to
be
there
in
new
york
that
been
taken
out
of
the
equat
radcliff
conced
she
will
probabl
learn
a
lot
from
her
bad
experi
in
athen
in
time
and
richard
and
yell
agre
she
could
turn
the
trauma
to
her
advantag
start
in
new
york
how
you
respond
to
advers
is
what
mark
you
out
a
elit
or
not
argu
richard
one
of
the
challeng
of
massiv
set
back
is
how
you
turn

and
yell
say
i
think
thi
will
probabl
make
paula
i
think
it
will
drive
her
on
and
shell
come
out
of
it
a
better
athlet
