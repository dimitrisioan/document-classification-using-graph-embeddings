six
break
point
in

five
of
the
second
i
kept

game
said
william
afterward
i
dont

i
guess
that
what
happen
i
didnt
want

particular
game
becaus
it
would
have
given
her
a
lot
of
momentum

confid
despit
let

break
point
slip
away

look
comfort
enough
at
but
from
up
she
just
fold
william
won
nine
consecut
point
for
the
set
and
power
through
the
decid
a
a
lacklustr
davenport
look
to
have
run
out
of
energi
after
a
gruell
two
week
i
felt
like
i
wa
play
well
and
in
control
pretti
much
of
the
match
said
davenport
then
i
just
had
that
horribl
laps
i
think
serv
up
and
made
a
few
error
and
open
up
the
door
for
her
and
she
just
kept
go
through
it
at
the
end
i
think
i
wa
a
littl
bit
fatigu
but
she
took
advantag
of
it
and
kept
go
she
a
great
frontrunn
when
she
get
go
