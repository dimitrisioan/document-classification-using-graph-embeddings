critic
england
captain
jason

ha
rubbish
suggest
that
the
world
champion

a
team
in
declin
england
were
beaten
by
wale
in
their
six
nation
open
in
cardiff
last

franc
at
twickenham
on
sunday
robinson
said
we
are
certainli
not
on
the
declin
you
lose
one
game
and
it
doesnt
make
you
a
bad
team
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
player
weve
got
we
have
still
got
the
team
to
go
out
and
beat
anyon
on
our
day
england
find
themselv
strive
to
avoid
a
third
success
championship
defeat
for
the
first
time
sinc
but
fullback
robinson
belief
the
newlook
england
team
can
stop
the
rot
against
franc
last
weekend
we
should
have
won
the
game
he
said
but
if
we
can
underperform
and
lose
by
onli
two
point
then
i
am
sure
if
we
play
well
thi
week
we
will
get
the
win
we
need
we
prove
that
in
the
autumn
when
we
put
in
some
excel
perform
and
we
just
need
to
build
on
that
it
wa
a
disappoint
start
against
wale
and
we
might
be
down
on
that
but
we
are
certainli
not
out
we
will
come
out
fight
thi
week
robinson
also
had
word
of
comfort
for
yearold
newcastl
centr
mathew
tait
who
made
hi
intern
debut
against
wale
but
ha
been
demot
from
the
squad
to
face
franc
i
have
had
a
word
with
mathew
said
robinson
i
still
believ
in
him
he
is
an
outstand
player
but
we
have
gone
for
olli
barkley
becaus
of
the
kick
mathew
ha
just
got
to
take
it
on
the
chin
