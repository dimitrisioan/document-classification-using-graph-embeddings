athen
memori
soar
abov
low
well
it
goodby
to
anoth
olymp
year
and
a
usual
there
were
plenti
of
high
and
low
in
athen
obvious
there
no
get
away
from
the
differ
fortun
of
kelli
holm
and
paula
radcliff
but
i
want
to
remind
you
of
a
few
more
event
that
made
anoth
year
to
rememb
or
forget
for
athlet
one
of
my
favourit
olymp
moment
wa
kelli
success
in
the
m
win
that
race
wa
the
key
to
her
success
becaus
if
she
won
that
then
the
m
would
be
a
bit
of
a
formal
kelli
had
been
full
of
should
i
shouldnt
i
thought
about
go
for
the
doubl
in
athen
i
thought
whi
wouldnt
you
do
the
m
it
your
best
event
it
wa
such
good
fun
to
comment
on
her
m
and
it
wa
nice
to
be
abl
to
be
part
of
her
athen
stori
the
victori
for
the
british
men
xm
relay
team
wa
a
bit
of
a
surpris
but
a
great
climax
to
the
game
i
think
the
four
of
them
jason
garden
darren
campbel
marlon
devonish
and
mark
lewisfr
knew
deep
down
that
it
wa
their
best
chanc
of
a
medal
the
lad
had
run
poorli
in
the
individu
sprint
so
mayb
they
did
lift
their
game
when
they
knew
someth
wa
realli
at
stake
hicham
el
guerrouj
olymp
doubl
is
a
much
bigger
achiev
than
kelli
on
a
global
scale
he
wa
the
first
man
sinc
for
year
to
win
both
the
m
and
m
titl
a
soon
a
he
had
ad
the
m
crown
and
i
had
finish
comment
i
jump
up
ran
down
the
stair
push
everyon
out
the
way
and
just
gave
him
a
big
hug
he
is
one
of
the
few
african
runner
who
ha
embrac
the
tradit
of
the
mile
and
he
love
to
hear
all
the
roger
bannist
stori
hicham
is
someon
i
enjoy
have
a
bit
of
time
with
even
though
my
french
and
hi
english
are
not
veri
good
what
happen
to
paula
in
athen
thi
year
is
the
obviou
low
on
a
person
level
and
for
the
expect
of
the
nation
a
well
there
were
a
set
of
circumst
around
athen
that
conspir
to
produc
a
veri
dramat
end
which
i
think
ha
been
greatli
misunderstood
drop
out
of
the
marathon
wa
the
right
thing
to
do
but
start
in
the
m
five
day
later
wa
not
wise
that
wa
her
heart
and
not
her
head
react
paula
had
a
lot
of
littl
thing
go
wrong
in
her
prepar
and
on
the
day
thing
like
niggl
injuri
not
be
abl
to
do
all
her
run
session
and
feel
the
pressur
of
the
race
loom
ahead
of
her
i
think
she
came
to
the
start
line
in
athen
physic
and
emot
drain
and
if
even
the
smallest
thing
doesnt
feel
right
when
you
are
prepar
to
race
a
marathon
mile
down
the
road
it
will
hit
you
like
a
brick
wall
the
posit
thing
to
take
from
paula
olymp
it
that
she
will
have
learn
a
lot
from
it
and
so
will
a
lot
of
peopl
includ
me
pure
a
a
race
paula
victori
in
the
new
york
marathon
ha
to
go
down
a
one
of
the
most
thrill
it
wa
so
nipandtuck
between
her
and
kenya
susan
chepkemei
and
you
dont
usual
get
that
kind
of
excit
in

wa
also
a
real
delight
for
all
athlet
fan
becaus
to
use
one
of
my
favourit
word
paula
show
real
bounceback

inkl
how

out
kelli
and
the
xm
boy
victori
paper
over
the
crack
in
the
gener
perform
of
the
british

we
should
be
concern
that

not
produc
enough
peopl
who

capabl
of

final
at
senior
level

onli
individu
men
finalist

begin
to
look
even
gloomier
for
british
athlet

we
did
not

world
junior
championship
in
itali
dani
barn

it
realli
doesnt
look
good
for

beij
