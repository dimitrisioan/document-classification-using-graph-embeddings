european
medal
chanc
improv
what
have
the
european
indoor
trial
told
u
well
i
think
we
could
be
head
to
the
european
championship
with
half
a
dozen
medal
prospect
it
wa
good
to
see
athlet
begin
to
make
step
forward
to
see
a
few
new
face
and
there
were
lot
of
person
best
kick
around
the
best
perform
on
the
track
for
me
wa
sarah
claxton
win
in
the
m
hurdl
run
subeight
second
twice
in
a
week
put
her
right
up
there
and
if
she
repeat
that
in
madrid
she
will
be
close
to
pick
up
a
medal
but
what
wa
great
about
sunday
perform
wa
that
she
wa
under
pressur
to
produc
the
good
when
it
count
dian
allahgreen
ha
been
our
best
hurdler
for
some
time
now
and
i
think
she
wa
surpris
to
be
beaten
by
sarah
and
know
that
she
got
the
better
of
dian
in
a
headtohead
race
will
give
sarah
confid
in
the
men
race
on
saturday
allan
scott
wa
right
in
there
and
there
is
definit
more
to
come
from
him
in
fact
the
men
m
hurdl
is
so
strong
i
think
the
selector
will
pick
three
hurdler
to
go
to
madrid
phillip
idowu
lit
up
the
field
event
not
onli
with
hi
hair
but
also
with
hi
leap
of
m
which
put
him
at
the
top
of
the
world
rank
i
had
a
chat
with
him
befor
the
competit
and
he
wa
realli
look
forward
to
get
out
there
he
feel
he
is
in
great
shape
and
ha
some
big
jump
insid
him
but
then
phillip
alway
ha
a
lot
of
the
athlet
said
the
runway
wa
not
veri
help
so
for
phillip
to
jump
like
that
is
a
good
perform
he
is
such
a
huge
talent
but
just
need
some
consist
and
if
he
doe
that
then
the
big
jump
will
get
even
further
across
the
board
i
thought
kelli
sotherton
had
a
great
weekend
and
continu
to
show
she
is
develop
she
pick
up
three
person
best
in
the
long
jump
high
jump
and
m
hurdl
and
you
cant
ask
for
more
than
that
kelli
will
be
up
against
carolina
kluft
in
the
pentathlon
at
the
european
championship
but
she
ha
everi
chanc
of
a
medal
on
the
basi
of
what
weve
seen
so
far
she
ha
a
complic
train
regim
where
differ
peopl
help
her
with
differ
disciplin
but
it
seem
to
be
work
realli
well
it
wasnt
all
good
news
in
sheffield
i
thought
both
the
m
race
were
disappoint
in
differ
way
jason
garden
may
have
won
but
he
wasnt
at
hi
best
i
chat
to
him
afterward
and
he
know
it
wa
an
offday
for
him
he
there
to
be
shot
at
and
the
other
lad
nearli
got
a
big
scalp
out
there
in
the
woman
race
jeanett
kwayk
wa
hope
to
run
against
defend
champion
joic
maduaka
the
pair
are
enjoy
a
bit
of
rivalri
but
joic
had
to
pull
out
with
a
chest
infect
if
she
had
made
the
final
i
think
jeanett
would
have
gone
a
bit
quicker
janin
whitlock
compet
well
in
the
pole
vault
on
her
return
follow
a
twoyear
drug
ban
but
the
most
disappoint
thing
in
the
wider
view
is
that
she
is
our
best
pole
vaulter
by
a
long
way
and
that
shouldnt
be
the
case
the
event
ha
move
on
immens
sinc
janin
ha
been
away
and
if
there
wa
more
domest
competit
i
think
that
would
help
her
a
coupl
of
other
interest
topic
to
look
out
for
are
the
citizenship
issu
surround
mark
findlay
and
rabah
yusuf
findlay
is
a
london
who
ha
chosen
to
repres
trinidad
and
tobago
but
ha
never
run
for
them
so
he
could
still
compet
for
great
britain
yusuf
who
came
third
in
the
m
is
from
the
sudan
but
is
tri
to
gain
british
citizenship
he
came
to
britain
a
a
high
jumper
but
damag
hi
toe
start
do
more
run
and
found
hi
talent
so
we
shall
have
to
see
what
happen
to
both
of
them
