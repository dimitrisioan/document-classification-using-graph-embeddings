the
prospect

code
ha
been
the
main
talk
point
of
the
super
leagu

far
it
came
a
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
to
u
admit
lindsay
but
he
a
veri
loyal
friend
to
the
club
so
there
no
question
that
he
desert

he
just
fanci
a
challeng
although
the
move
would
be
a
lucr
one
for
both
farrel
and
wigan

said
money
wa
not
a
motiv
factor
for
the
club
the
money

been
conclud
but
it
not
the
point
for
wigan

shortag
of
money
ha
never
been
a
problem
for
