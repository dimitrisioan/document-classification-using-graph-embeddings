ireland
can
win
onli
their
second
grand
slam
and
first
sinc
in
thi
year
rb

championship
after

their
first
tripl

for
year
last
season
wood
tip
hi
former
teammat
to
go
one
better
thing
have
been
build
up
over
the
past
few
year
and
i
think
thi
is
the
year
for
ireland
he
told
bbc
sport
there
is
a
great
chanc
to
win
a
grand
slam
a
lot
of
thing
are
in
our
favour
with
england
and
franc
at
home
ireland
have
finish
runnersup
three
time
includ
last
year
sinc
the
old
five
nation
becam
six
in
and
not
finish
outsid
the
top
three
in
the
past
five
year
despit
be
without
flanker
keith
gleeson
coach
eddi
osullivan
ha
not
had
to
contend
with
the
sort
of
casualti
list
that
have
hit
england
and
scotland
in
particular
prior
to
the
tournament
for
ireland
to
win
it
we
need
to
stay
rel
injuri
free
and
fortun
we
are
one
of
the
few
team
that
have
done
that
so
far
wood
ad
it
is
go
to
be
tough
and
we
need
to
take
all
the
luck
and
opportun
that
come
our
way
ireland
last
game
of
the
tournament
is
against
wale
in
cardiff
a
fixtur
they
have
not
lost
sinc
but
despit
their
tradit
hospit
when
the
irish
are
visit
wood
believ
wale
might
end
their
fourmatch
lose
run
against
england
in
cardiff
so
mani
of
the
major
england
player
have
either
retir
in
the
last
year
or
are
injur
that
i
think
it
will
be
veri
hard
for
them
down
in
cardiff
wood
ad
wale
have
had
four
brilliant
game
in
the
last
year
or
so
and
lost
all
four
so
the
time
is
right
for
them
now
to
beat
one
of
the
major
team
