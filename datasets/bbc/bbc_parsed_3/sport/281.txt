admit
he
is
at
a
loss
to
explain
whi
newcastl
are
languish
in
the
bottom
half
of
the
tabl
the
gunner
travel
to
st
jame
park
on
wednesday
with
newcastl
th
in
the
premiership
after
a
troubl
season
and
wenger
said
at
the
begin
of
the
season
you
would
expect
them
to
be
fight
for
the
top
four
i
dont
know
how
they
got
to
be
where
they
are
it
look
to
me
from
the
outsid
that
they
have
mani
injuri
arsen
go
into
the
game
on
the
back
of
a
victori
over
fulham
on
sunday
and
wenger
ad
the
best
way
to
prepar
for
a
game
is
to
win
the
previou
one
we
will
go
to
newcastl
in
good
shape
fatigu
wont
play
too
big
a
part
in
the
next
few
week
a
we
have
player
come
back
so
i
can
rotat
a
bit
more
we
do
not
play
a
season
with
player
and
i
believ
that
all
of
our
squad
deserv
a
chanc
in
the
team
striker
thierri
henri
along
with
robert
pire
score
against
fulham
and
henri
afterward
describ
the
display
a
beauti
to
watch
he
said
what
matter
is
win
and
the
three
point
of
cours
that
is
the
onli
thing
that
realli
matter
but
it
is
more
enjoy
when
you
play
like
we
did
against
fulham
we
are
play
a
a
team
and
that
is
import
becaus
there
were
some
game
when
we
mayb
were
not
there
a
a
team
and
suffer
for
that
those
were
game
we
lost
