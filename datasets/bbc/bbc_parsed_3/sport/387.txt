lion
blow
to
world
cup
winner
british
and
irish
lion
coach
clive
woodward
say
he
is
unlik
to
select
ani
player
not
involv
in
next
year
rb
six
nation
championship
world
cup
winner
lawrenc
dallaglio
neil
back
and
martin
johnson
had
all
been
thought
to
be
in
the
frame
for
next
summer
tour
to
new
zealand
i
dont
think
you
can
ever
say
never
said
woodward
but
i
would
have
to
have
a
compuls
reason
to
pick
ani
player
who
is
not
avail
to
intern
rugbi
dallaglio
back
and
johnson
have
all
retir
from
intern
rugbi
over
the
last
month
but
continu
to
star
for
their
club
side
but
woodward
ad
the
key
thing
that
i
want
to
stress
is
that
i
intend
to
use
the
six
nation
and
the
player
who
are
avail
to
intern
rugbi
a
the
key
benchmark
my
job
along
with
all
the
other
senior
repres
is
to
make
sure
that
we
pick
the
strongest
possibl
team
if
you
are
not
play
intern
rugbi
then
it
still
a
step
up
to
test
rugbi
it
definit
a
disadvantag
i
think
it
absolut
critic
and
with
the
histori
of
the
lion
we
have
got
to
take
player
play
for
the
four
countri
woodward
also
reveal
that
the
race
for
the
captainci
wa
still
wide
open
it
is
an
open
book
he
said
there
are
some
outstand
candid
from
all
four
countri
and
follow
the
all
black
impress
display
in
europ
in
recent
week
includ
a
humili
of
franc
woodward
belief
the
threetest
seri
in
new
zealand
will
provid
the
ultim
rugbi
challeng
their
perform
in
particular
against
franc
wa
simpli
awesom
said
the
lion
coach
certain
thing
have
been
suggest
about
the
potenc
of
their
front
five
but
theyr
a
veri
power
unit
with
hi
customari
thorough
woodward
reveal
he
had
taken
sound
from
australia
coach
eddi
jone
and
jake
white
of
south
africa
follow
their
tour
match
in
britain
and
ireland
a
a
result
woodward
stress
hi
lion
group
might
not
be
domin
by
player
from
england
and
ireland
and
held
out
hope
for
the
struggl
scot
scotland
recent
result
have
not
been
that
impress
but
there
have
been
some
excel
individu
perform
eddi
in
particular
told
me
how
tough
they
had
made
it
for
australia
and
i
will
take
on
board
their
opinion
and
scotland
forward
simon
taylor
look
certain
to
get
the
call
provid
he
recov
from
knee
and
tendon
problem
i
took
lesson
from
in
that
they
did
make
a
mistak
in
take
lawrenc
dallaglio
when
he
wasnt
fit
and
went
on
the
trip
everi
player
ha
to
be
look
at
on
their
own
merit
and
simon
taylor
is
an
outstand
player
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
he
get
back
to
full
fit
he
will
be
on
the
trip
i
am
told
he
should
be
back
play
by
march
and
he
ha
plenti
of
time
to
prove
hi
fit
for
the
lion
and
there
are
other
player
like
richard
hill
in
the
same
boat
