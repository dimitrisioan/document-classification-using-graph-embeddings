but
bailey
doe
see
some
hope
for
the
futur
he
said
now
weve
drop
down
to
the
euroafrica
zone
the
time
wa
right
for
him
to
step
down
and
let
the

come
to
the
fore
britain
next
oppon
israel
are
hardli
like
to
be
quak
in

ahead
of
the
march

against
a
like
trio
of
bogdanov
murray
and
the
thrank

it
will
be
tough
for

there
come
a
time
when

wa
alway
go

grow
year
im
confid
about
the
futur
i
wouldnt
lay
money
on
u
get

id
imagin

of
those
line
up
to
replac
henman
the
yearold
murray
with

futur
titl
under
