that
statement
wa
made
to
look
a
littl
foolish
by
event
later
that
afternoon
at
twickenham
but
it
illustr
the
wonder
unpredict
of
test

ahead
of
what
could
be
the
most
open
six

championship
for
a
decad
while
the
wallabi
all

and
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
a
decad
it
will
not
simpli
be
a
straightforward
choic
between
england
and
franc
for
the
six
nation
titl
that
owe
much
to
ireland
continu
progress
and
the
belief
that
wale
are
on
the
verg
of
deliv
a
major
scalp
to
cement
the
promis
of
their
autumn
display
who
secur

further
proof

won
nine
of
the
last
six
nation
titl
between
them
will
lay
down
quietli
dismantl
of

suggest
that
even
after
the

they
still
have
the
personnel
to

is
within

but
thi
time
it
appear
there
is
substanc
behind
the
rediscov
style
while
south

made
for
a
closer
scorelin
than
expect
wale
could
legitim

have
had
victori
within
