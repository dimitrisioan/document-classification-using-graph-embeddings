chief
execut
in

from
a
similar
role
at
the
premier
leagu
there
have
been
sever
high
and
low
dure
hi
time
in
charg
at
anfield
and
he
had
a
busi
summer
overse
the
arriv
of
new
manag
rafael

and
manag
to
hold
on
to
steven

an
option
on
the
england
midfield
man
dure
negoti
for
striker
fernando
morient
he
said
they
were
look
for
way
of
say
they
got
more
out
of
the
deal
for
fernando
morient
but
the
respons
to
real
madrid
wa
the
same
steven
is
not
for
sale
but
when
ask
if
gerrard
would
be
a
liverpool
player
on
the
first
day
of
next
season
parri
said
i
sincer
hope
he
will
be
steven
know
my
view
he
know
rafa
view
we
have
reaffirm
recent
to
steven
that
we
are
tri
to
build
a
team
around
him
we
crave
success
a
much
a
he
doe
we
know
he
ambiti
and
nobodi
can
argu
with
that
i
think
steven
would
dearli
love
to
win
thing
with
liverpool
more
than
hed
like
to
do
anyth
el
we
all
want
to
see
progress
by
next
season
he
not
alon
in
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
player
who
feel
the
same
so
we
all
have
a
common
aim
it
is
expect
chelsea
will
test
liverpool
with
a
â£mplu
bid
in
the
summer
but
parri
claim
he
will
be
in
no
mood
to
listen
there
have
been
a
lot
of
open
secret
about
steven
most
of
which
have
been
complet
myth
it
is
suggest
we
had
a
deal
tie
up
last
summer
we
didnt
had
an
offer
last
summer
parri
explain
we
had
told
chelsea
that
a
far
a
we
were
concern
he
wa
not
for
sale
and
we
didnt
want
to
sell
him
in
realiti
it
didnt
go
beyond
that
mayb
there
will
be
an
offer
in
the
summer
mayb
there
wont
our
posit
is
we
want
steven
to
stay
but
we
are
also
realist
enough
and
have
enough
respect
for
steven
and
he
ha
enough
respect
for
u
to
know
that
it
is
hi
decis
that
will
be
crucial
you
are
not
go
to
keep
a
player
like
steven
against
hi
will
that
just
doesnt
work
but
ani
idea
we
are
go
to
accept
offer
for
steven
and
then
tell
him
by
the
way
weve
decid
to
sell
you
is
not
on
the
agenda
you
can
forget
that
parri
is
current
in
the
process
of
finalis
fund
for
liverpool
new
stadium
in
stanley
park
which
is
set
to
open
in
and
he
confess
arsen
â£m
deal
with
emir
to
sponsor
their
new
ground
complet
with
name
right
ha
given
the
anfield
club
seriou
food
for
thought
he
said
i
have
to
say
histor
it
is
someth
i
have
been
against
and
i
have
been
on
record
a
say
that
but
i
think
the
size
of
the
arsen
deal
is
a
real
eyeopen
i
would
say
in
the
past
deal
have
been
done
frankli
far
too
cheapli
and
it
just
hasnt
even
been
worth
contempl
but
the
arsen
deal
is
the
sort
of
deal
that
caus
you
to
draw
breath
and
say
wow
that
interest
my
person
point
of
view
is
that
i
would
find
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
palat
than
a
share
stadium
some
liverpool
fan
would
find
such
a
move
highli
controversi
but
parri
counter
i
recognis
it
would
be
an
emot
issu
for
mani
support
but
you
look
at
the
amount
of
money
avail
and
it
could
go
into
the
team
if
it
wa
the
right
partner
how
strong
an
issu
is
it
time
will
tell
i
think
the
stadium
will
alway
be
anfield
not
least
becaus
of
where
it
is
but
do
we
need
to
investig
the
possibl
of
sponsorship
i
think
it
would
be
remiss
not
to
that
not
to
say
we
have
made
a
decis
that
we
will
go
down
that
road
but
i
think
it
is
clearli
someth
we
have
to
explor
on
the
subject
of
possibl
new
invest
parri
reveal
liverpool
are
still
in
negoti
with
a
mysteri
investor
with
rumour
of
interest
from
the
middl
east
that
prompt
the
withdraw
of
tycoon
steve
morgan
who
got
frustrat
by
fail
bid
and
what
he
claim
wa
indecis
by
the
board
he
also
accus
liverpool
of
use
him
a
a
stalk
hors
to
attract
other
bid
but
parri
explain
steve
ha
never
been
use
a
a
stalk
hors
there
no
need
and
that
is
not
the
way
we
do
busi
we
had
discus
with
steve
over
the
cours
of
i
think
we
came
close
to
conclud
a
deal
in
the
summer
but
it
didnt
happen
quit
genuin
the
new
interest
did
appear
rel
late
in
the
day
just
prior
to
the
agm
in
decemb
and
a
i
have
said
it
wa
of
such
potenti
magnitud
and
that
potenti
is
so
excit
we
felt
we
had
to
evalu
it
we
are
still
evalu
it
steve
interest
wa
taken
veri
much
on
it
own
merit
hi
enthusiasm
for
the
club
is
there
for
all
to
see
and
who
know
what
the
next
few
month
will
hold
the
door
isnt
close
on
anyth
we
had
a
perfectli
sensibl
dialogu
with
steve
last
year
we
have
a
common
interest
in
make
liverpool
success
that
a
dream
we
all
share
so
a
far
a
im
concern
the
door
is
not
close
i
would
take
â£m
if
we
had
no
invest
but
if
we
did
keep
him
a
for
the
stadium
if
it
get
u
cash
what
differ
doe
it
make
realli
â£m
for
gerrard
i
dont
care
who
you
are
the
director
would
take
the
money
and
it
is
the
way
it
should
be
we
can
not
let
that
sum
of
money
go
despit
gerrard
qualiti
through
a
cleverli
word
statement
the
club
ha
effect
forc
gerrard
to
publicli
make
the
decis
for
himself
which
i
think
is
the
right
thing
to
do
critic
time
for
liverpool
with
regard
to
gerrard
ideal
we
would
want
to
secur
hi
futur
to
the
club
for
the
long
term
i
am
hope
he
doesnt
walk
out
of
the
club
like
michael
owen
did
for
veri
littl
cash
â£m
realist
would
allow
rafa
to
complet
rebuild
the
squad
howev
if
we
can
afford
to
do
thi
and
keep
gerrard
we
will
be
better
for
it
i
would
howev
be
happi
with
gerrard
transfer
for
ani
fee
over
â£m
parri
statement
are
clever
in
that
ani
futur
gerrard
transfer
can
not
be
constru
a
a
lack
of
ambit
by
the
club
to
not
tri
and
keep
their
best
player
up
the
ant
is
anoth
smart
move
by
parri
i
would
keep
gerrard
no
amount
of
money
could
replac
hi
obviou
love
of
the
club
and
determin
to
succeed
the
key
is
if
gerrard
come
out
and
say
that
he
is
happi
clearli
if
he
isnt
then
we
would
be
foolish
not
to
sell
the
worri
thing
is
who
would
you
buy
or
who
would
come
