of
the

report
that

a
french
magazin
i
either
decid
to

titl
or
to
have
an
easi
life
i
think
i
will
alway
choos
footbal
if
a
great
club
make
me
an
offer
he
ad
to
win
titl
you
need
player
who
have
the
capabl
of
do
so
if
we
stagnat
between
eighth
and
th
place
it
imposs
to
progress
if
i
am
go
to
score
goal
and
not
win
there
is
a
risk
it
is
go
to
creat
a
feel
of
be
fed
up
anelka
ha
earn
a
reput
for
be
a
difficult
charact
to
handl
after

back
to
haunt
him
i
am
in
talk
to
sign
an
extens
to
my
contract
he
said
i
am
well
here
but
the
sport
aspect
also
come
into
account
play
for
eighth
place
is
good
but
i
miss
the
champion
leagu
i
won
it
with
real
madrid
in
and
i
need
to
be
play
in
it
and
i
should
be
play
in
it
im
not
in
it
becaus
of
thing
that
have
happen
in
the
past
and
had
noth
to
do
with
footbal
but
i
dont
blame
