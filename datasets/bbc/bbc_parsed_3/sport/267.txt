manag
john
robertson
hope
a
place
in
the
knockout
stage
of
the
uefa
cup
could
help
keep
some
of
hi
outofcontract
player
at
the
club
it
could
help
if
we
get
through
and
have
anoth
european
tie
it
may
encourag
player
to
stay
at
least
until
the
end
of
the
season
he
said
if
we
manag
to
get
through
it
show
how
well
the
club
progress
they
have
to
think
whether
they
are
go
to
get
other
club
like
that
should
they
decid
to
move
on
a
win
for
robertson
side
against
ferencvaro
would
put
them
through
to
the
last
if
basl
fail
to
beat
feyenoord
it
veri
much
the
player
prerog
but
the
fact
that
weve
been
play
european
footbal
for
the
last
three
or
four
year
is
obvious
an
incent
ad
robertson
but
we
want
player
who
want
to
play
for
the
footbal
club
who
are
commit
and
a
run
in
europ
alway
help
a
littl
bit
with
the
game
be
play
at
murrayfield
instead
of
tynecastl
becaus
of
uefa
regul
robertson
see
both
posit
and
neg
aspect
to
the
chang
of
venu
the
pitch
is
not
in
the
greatest
condit
the
heineken
cup
game
wa
there
at
the
weekend
and
the
pitch
is
a
bit
threadbar
he
said
it
not
ideal
but
it
the
same
for
both
team
so
we
just
have
to
go
out
and
there
and
perform
that
the
most
import
thing
but
he
ad
if
tynecastl
could
have
host
it
would
have
been
fantast
but
that
one
of
the
benefit
of
murrayfield
it
allow
u
to
bring
even
more
of
our
support
into
it
there
will
be
a
good
atmospher
and
the
heart
fan
have
an
import
role
to
play
we
need
their
encourag
we
need
them
to
get
right
behind
the
side
and
make
it
a
good
an
atmospher
a
possibl
hope
the
player
will
respond
to
that
and
i
know
they
will
becaus
it
a
fantast
european
night
for
the
club
