should
the
great
britain
rugbi
leagu
captain
decid

are
still
some
way

tiger
bo
john
well
told
bbc
radio
leicest
at
the
moment
there
are
still
a
lot
of
unknown
about
andi
farrel
not
least
hi
medic
situat
whoever
doe
take
him
on
is
go
to
take
a
big
big
gambl
farrel
who
ha
had
persist
knee
problem
had
an
oper
on
hi
knee
five
week
ago
and
is
expect
to
be
out
for
anoth
three
month
leicest
and
saracen
are
believ
to
head
the
list
of
rugbi
union
club
interest
in
sign
farrel
if
he
decid
to
move
to
the
man
game
if
he
doe
move
across
to
union
well
belief
he
would
better
off
play
in
the
back
at
least
initi
im
sure
he
could
make
the
step
between
leagu
and
union
by
be
involv
in
the
centr
said
well
i
think
england
would
prefer
him
to
progress
to
a
posit
in
the
back
row
where
they
can
make
use
of
some
of
hi
rugbi
leagu
skill
within
the
forward
the
juri
is
out
on
whether
he
can
cross
that
divid
at
thi
club
the
balanc
will
have
to
be
struck
between
the
cost
of
that
gambl
and
the
option
of
bring
in
a
readymad
