specul
continu
about

but
all
met
with
an
understand

of
secreci
from

see
the

a
crucial
to

the

liverpool
manag

to
the

parri
will
pull
back
the
moment
the
figur
do
not
stack
up
but
there
ha
been
a
vital
new
develop
in
north
london
that
ha
reshap
liverpool
think
liverpool
have
publicli
refus
to
entertain
the
idea
of
stadium
sponsorship
and
potenti
name
right
but
the
realism
of
arsen
stun
â£m
deal
for
their
new
emir
stadium
at
ashburton
ha
chang
the
landscap
parri
label
the
deal
an
eyeopen
and
admit
liverpool
would
be
miss
a
trick
not
to
explor
the
possibl
he
know
some
traditionalist
liverpool
fan
will
reel
at
ani
attempt
to
call
the
new
stadium
anyth
other
than
just
anfield
but
the
math
of
modernday
footbal
decre
that
multimillion
for
stadium
and
team
could
ea
the
pain
i
would
take
â£m
if
we
had
no
invest
but
if
we
did
keep
him
a
for
the
stadium
if
it
get
u
cash
what
differ
doe
it
make
realli
â£m
for
gerrard
i
dont
care
who
you
are
the
director
would
take
the
money
and
it
is
the
way
it
should
be
we
can
not
let
that
sum
of
money
go
despit
gerrard
qualiti
through
a
cleverli
word
statement
the
club
ha
effect
forc
gerrard
to
publicli
make
the
decis
for
himself
which
i
think
is
the
right
thing
to
do
critic
time
for
liverpool
with
regard
to
gerrard
ideal
we
would
want
to
secur
hi
futur
to
the
club
for
the
long
term
i
am
hope
he
doesnt
walk
out
of
the
club
like
michael
owen
did
for
veri
littl
cash
â£m
realist
would
allow
rafa
to
complet
rebuild
the
squad
howev
if
we
can
afford
to
do
thi
and
keep
gerrard
we
will
be
better
for
it
i
would
howev
be
happi
with
gerrard
transfer
for
ani
fee
over
â£m
parri
statement
are
clever
in
that
ani
futur
gerrard
transfer
can
not
be
constru
a
a
lack
of
ambit
by
the
club
to
not
tri
and
keep
their
best
player
up
the
ant
is
anoth
smart
move
by
parri
i
would
keep
gerrard
no
amount
of
money
could
replac
hi
obviou
love
of
the
club
and
determin
to
succeed
the
key
is
if
gerrard
come
out
and
say
that
he
is
happi
clearli
if
he
isnt
then
we
would
be
foolish
not
to
sell
the
worri
thing
is
who
would
you
buy
or
who
would
come
