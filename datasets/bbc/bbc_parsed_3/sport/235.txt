you
the

all
at
hi
foot
the
situat
concern
the
food
fight
ha
been
judg
and
there
is
a
game
go
on
in
a
month
the
manag
have
a
respons
to
protect
the
game
befor
the
game
but
in
england
you

matter
what
peopl
say

wenger
ad
i
dont

england
you
have
a
good
phrase
it
is
bring
the
game
into
disreput
but
that
is
not
onli
after
a
game
it
is
a
well
befor
a
game
ferguson
had
also
claim
that
unit
chief
execut
david
gill
and
arsen
vicechairman
david
dein
had
agre
at
boardroom
level
not
to
discu
the
incid
in
public
but
ferguson
ad
in
the
ensu
week
all
you
got
wa
a
diatrib
from
arsen
about
be
kick
off
the
pitch
and
all
that
nonsens
gill
phone
dein
three
time

complain
but
noth
wa
done
the
return
is
on
februari
and
they
will
come
out
with
anoth
diatrib
david
gill
and
i
feel
we
should
set
the
record
straight
becaus
arsen
have
not
written
to
u
to
apologis
and
we
would
not
let
that
happen
here
meanwhil
the
leagu
manag
associ
have
offer
to
act
a
peacemak
in
the
hope
of
resolv
the
ongo
row
dure
that
stormi
game
in
octob
unit
striker
ruud
van
nistelrooy
caught
arsen
ashley
cole

particularli
strong
tackl
wenger
later
accus
van

wa
fine
â£
and
sever
reprimand
by
the
footbal
associ
ferguson
admit
on
saturday
that
van
nistelrooy
tackl
which
earn
the
dutchman
a
ban
could
have
given

a
seriou
injuri
but
he
belief
arsen
were
the
main
aggressor
wenger
is
alway
complain
the
match
wa
not
play
in
the
right
spirit
he
ad
they
are
the
worst
loser
of
all
time
they
dont
know
how
to
lose
mayb
it
is
just
manchest
unit
they
dont
lose
mani
game
to
other
team
we
tend
to
forget
the
worst
disciplinari
record
of
all
time
wa
arsen
up
until
last
season
in
fair
it
ha
improv
and
now
they
are
seen
a
paragon
of
