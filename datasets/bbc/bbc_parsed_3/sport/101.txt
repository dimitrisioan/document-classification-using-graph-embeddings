but
that
wa
all
about
to
chang
after

unit
pour
forward
and
there
wa
a
renew
urgenc
about
their
play
and
when
nevil
deliv
a
cross
in
a
carbon
copi
of
citi
best
firsthalf
chanc
rooney
show
mcmanaman
how
to

miss
anoth
great
chanc
from
close
rang
and
unit
keeper
roy
carrol
save
well
from
kiki

could
have
a
had
a
third
late
on

substitut
ryan

hit
the
post
manchest
citi
bos
kevin
keegan
we
had
a
great
chanc
to
take
the
lead
and
the
first
goal
wa
alway
go
to
be
crucial
we
start
off
with
a
good
tempo
but
then
we
allow
them
to
dictat
the
pace
a
bit
too
much
but
we
still
had
four
good
chanc
two
after

mcmanaman
miss
wa
veri
similar
to
the
one

it
wasnt
our
best
perform
of

deserv
winner
at
time
especi
in
the
first
half
we
didnt
play
with
enough
speed
but
with
cristiano
ronaldo
and
ryan
gigg
on
the
speed
improv
