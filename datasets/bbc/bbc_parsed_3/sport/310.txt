kevin
wa
veri
much
in
the
select

anyway
and
the
unfortun

give
him
the
chanc
to

said

now
that
ryan

ha
recov
from

we
have
increas
the
option
in
the
back
row
jonathan
thoma
is
unlucki
to
lose
hi
spot
after
perform
well
against

and
score
a
tri
but
such
is
the
competit
for
place
that
everi
posit
is
debat
in
detail
for
thi
particular
game
we
felt
we
might
not
alway
be
afford
the
open
space
out
wide
we
were
abl
to
exploit
against
itali
so
an
extra
big
ballcarri
in
the
backrow
is
thought
to
be
necessari
on
thi
occas
obvious
it
a
man
game
these
day
and
there
is
everi
chanc
that
jonathan
will
be
make
an
impact
from
the
bench
wale
have
beaten
franc
on
two
of
their
last
three
visit
to
pari
and
anoth
victori
thi
time
around
would
keep
them
firmli
on
cours
for
a
first
five
or
six
nation
titl
triumph
sinc
graham
henri
former
wale
coach
said
a
coupl
of

that
we
should
be
bold
when
go
to
franc
and
he
wa
prove
right
said
ruddock
that
is
a
great
way
to
approach
the
game
and
someth
we
will
further
endors
