give
me
a
bigger
free
role
to
come
in
where
i
am
not

and
influenc
thing
that
ha
been
appar
in
part
one
and
two
of
the
waspsleicest
trilog
in
recent
week
first
healey
came
off
hi
flank
with
an
angl
run
to
score
an
injurytim
tri
that
earn
the
tiger
a
draw
in
their
premiership
meet
on

then
in

and
deliv
a
superb
crosskick
for
martin

to
score
the
tiger
third
tri
i
caught
cozza
eye
a
coupl
of
phase
befor
that
and
wa
hope
to
get
it
to
him
on
the
full
but
fortun
even
with
the
bounc
he
manag
to
score
healey
recal
healey
twice
a
heineken
cup
winner
belief
last
sunday
match
wa
up
there
with
some
of
the
biggest
club
contest
he
ha
play
in
it
wa
a
veri
intens
occas
and
a
veri
destruct
game
he
recal
there
wa
not
a
huge
amount
of
rugbi
play
but
it
wa
a
great
game
to
be
involv
in
after
about
minut
i
thought
we
might
stride
away
with
it
but
wasp
realli
came
back
into
it
and
in
the
last
coupl
of
minut
it
could
have
gone
either
way
the
same
outcom
thi
sunday
would
put
leicest
in
pole
posit
to
top
their
heineken
pool
with
a
home
game
against
biarritz
and
away
trip
to
calvisano
to
come
but
healey
insist
the
tiger
must
summon
the
same
desir
if
they
are
to
deliv
the
knockout
blow
in
what
ha
been
dub
rugbi
version
of
rocki
ii
there
wa
a
lot
of
satisfact
in
the
dress
room
afteward
but
it
is
realli
onli
a
case
of
a
job
half
done
he
ad
it
wa
the
first
of
a
twoleg
trip
and
if
we
lose
at
welford
road
it
will
negat
all
the
posit
we
can
take
from
result
i
think
it
came
down
to
who
want
it
more
and
in
the
end
i
think
we
did
we
have
got
to
show
the
same
desir
again
thi
week
