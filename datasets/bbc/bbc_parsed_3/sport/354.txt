decre
after

i
doubt
whether

go
to
gloat
about
the
handl
of
hi
player
he
is
not
that
sort
of
person
howev
he
may
look
at
the
overwork
and
injuryhit
england
wale
and
franc
squad
whose
player
have
been
overwork
and
then
pat
himself
on
the
back
for
hi
foresight
but
there
is
still
the
question
of
turn
up
and
transfer
that
fresh
into
posit
result
when
the
refere
signal
the
start

osullivan
side
are
veri
capabl
of
