he
had
given
up
on
wimbledon
and
win
hi
second
grand
slam
titl
ha
not
chang
hi
mind
ill

but
with
no
expect
i
feel
like
i
cant
wast
my
time
my
energi
on
that
surfac
he
said
some
peopl
they
can
not
play
on
clay
some
peopl
they
can
not
play
on
a
hard
court
me
i
cant
play
on
grass
howev
safin
is
hope
that
win
the
australian
open
will
give
him
the
belief
he
need
to
win
more
grand
slam
titl
it
a
relief
for
me
two
grand
slam
it
alreadi
someth
but
with
thi
one
i
work
realli
hard
for
it
he
said
basic
i
would
love
to
win
a
coupl
more
i
think
i
have
a
chanc
if
i
continu
thi
way
if
coach
peter
lundgren
will
stick
around
with
me
and
want
to
work
with
me
for
a
bit
longer
i
think
i
can
make
it
the
yearold
shock
pete
sampra
in
the
u
open
final
to
win
hi
first
major
titl
but
then
lost
in
two
australian
open
final
safin
admit
he
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
he
would
win
anoth
grand
slam
i
didnt
expect
that
to
win
the
u
open
it
wa
against
sampra
i
wasnt
the
favourit
so
i
had
no
pressur
whatsoev
he
said
after
the
first
final
that
i
didnt
win
against
thoma
johansson
in
i
couldnt
see
myself
win
the
grand
slam
anymor
i
wa
onc
in
the
semifin
of
the
french
open
but
i
didnt
believ
i
can
win
it
i
just
couldnt
handl
the
pressur
you
need
to
believ
in
yourself
and
i
didnt
and
after
lose
the
first
set
to
lleyton
hewitt
in
sunday
final
safin
said
he
began
to
doubt
himself
again
i
am
im
play
against
hewitt
at
least
you
have
to
have
the
opportun
to
win
it
at
least
have
a
chanc
he
said
it
like
you
go
there
and
you
lose
first
set
then
you
start
to
think
thi
is
not
my
day
the
way
im
play
is
ridicul
but
then
you
start
to
realli
be
a
littl
bit
more
selfish
and
tri
to
find
a
way
out
of
there
and
i
found
it
i
wa
like
realli
much
i
wa
much
happier
than
in
that
for
sure
becaus
i
get
over
it
