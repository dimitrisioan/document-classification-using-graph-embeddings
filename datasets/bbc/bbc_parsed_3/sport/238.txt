ferguson
put
faith
in
youngster
manchest
unit
manag
sir
alex
ferguson
said
he
ha
no
regret
after
hi
secondstr
side
lost
away
at
fenerbahc
in
the
champion
leagu
ferguson
said
the
good
thing
about
be
manag
is
that
you
are
in
control
of
which
team
to
pick
i
care
about
unit
that
import
so
while
i
am
disappoint
at
the
result
i
am
not
at
the
team
i
select
thi
game
wa
import
for
the
young
lad
they
will
rememb
it
and
next
time
they
come
they
will
be
better
ferguson
admit
hi
side
were
wellbeaten
by
the
turk
a
result
which
meant
they
finish
second
in
group
d
behind
lyon
he
ad
theyll
know
not
to
play
like
that
again
we
show
a
lack
of
strength
but
i
have
no
complaint
about
the
scorelin
in
the
second
half
we
had
some
good
moment
in
attack
and
in
that
situat
you
have
to
take
one
chanc
but
we
didnt
do
that
so
the
game
just
peter
out
for
u
i
didnt
think
it
made
much
differ
whether
we
won
the
group
or
finish
second
and
i
still
dont
we
could
get
inter
ac
milan
and
juventu
but
bayern
barcelona
and
real
madrid
were
among
the
runnersup
all
we
can
do
is
let
fate
decid
how
it
work
out
