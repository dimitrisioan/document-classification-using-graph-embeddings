captainci
brian
moor
believ
the
england
captain
should
not
be
a
fullback
jason
robinson
ha
led
the
team
dure
their
open
three
defeat
in
the
six
nation
tournament
in
the
absenc
of
flyhalf
jonni
wilkinson
the
world
champion
have
struggl
sinc
the
retir
of
former
captain
martin
johnson
a
lock
forward
and
former
england
captain
moor
told
the
bbc
fullback
are
too
far
away
from
the
action
that
not
a
reflect
on
robinson
person
he
ad
i
just
think
the
point
of
influenc
need
to
move
closer
to
the
pack
which
is
after
all
where
game
usual
start
and
finish
moor
say
a
lack
of
cohes
in
the
forward
is
one
of
the
reason
whi
england
have
lost
against
wale
franc
and
ireland
in
thi
year
tournament
assert
in
the
pack
isnt
there
were
not
get
enough
peopl
into
the
breakdown
he
explain
were
not
get
quick
ball
which
mean
the
back
are
be
stifl
their
creativ
depend
on
quick
ball
and
were
not
get
that
with
injuri
depriv
him
of
key
player
like
wilkinson
coach
andi
robinson
ha
given
youngster
such
a
harri
elli
and
jami
noon
a
chanc
and
moor
believ
the
last
two
game
against
itali
and
scotland
are
a
good
opportun
to
experi
further
the
problem
is
the
player
that
are
around
to
replac
the
icon
which
have
been
lost
becaus
of
retir
and
injuri
dont
have
the
requisit
experi
moor
ad
you
cant
do
anyth
about
that
but
play
them
there
are
player
who
have
been
knock
on
the
door
it
time
for
them
to
be
look
at
in
these
last
two
game
becaus
there
noth
on
them
we
then
go
into
next
season
with
a
greater
certainti
of
who
can
and
can
not
handl
the
pressur
of
