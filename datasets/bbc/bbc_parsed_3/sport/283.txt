centimetr
or
an
inch
or
two
over

line
it
wa
a
metr
insid
the

what
realli
annoy
me
is
that
we
are
here
in
watch
someth
on
a
tv
monitor
within
two
second
of
the
incid
occur
and
the
refere
isnt
told
about
it
we
didnt
play
particularli
well
but
i
am
plea
even
now
with
a
point
although
we
should
have
had
three
mend
could
not
believ
the
goal
wa
not
given
after
see
a
replay
he
said
my
reaction
on
the
pitch
wa
to
celebr
it
wa
a
veri
nice
goal
it
wa
clearli
over
the
line
ive
never
seen
one
so
over
the
line
and
not
given
in
my
career
it
realli
realli
over
what
can
you
do
but
laugh
about
it
it
a
nice
goal
and
one
to
keep
in
my
memori
even
though
it
didnt
count
it
not
everi
game
you
score
from
the
halfway
line
manchest
unit
manag
sir
alex
ferguson
sympathis
with
tottenham
and
said
the
incid
highlight
the
need
for
video
technolog
i
think
it
hammer
home
what
a
lot
of
peopl
have
been
ask
for
and
that
that
technolog
should
play
a
part
in
the
game
ferguson
told
mutv
what
i
wa
against
origin
wa
the
time
factor
in
video
replay
but
i
read
an
articl
the
other
day
which
suggest
that
if
a
refere
cant
make
up
hi
mind
after
second
of
watch
a
video
replay
then
the
game
should
carri
on
thirti
second
is
about
the
same
amount
of
time
it
take
to
organis
a
freekick
or
take
a
corner
or
a
goalkick
so
you
wouldnt
be
wast
a
lot
of
time
i
think
you
could
start
off
by
use
it
for
goallin
decis
i
think
that
would
be
an
open
into
a
new
area
of
footbal
arsen
bos
arsen
wenger
also
use
the
incid
to
highlight
the
need
for
video
technolog
when
the
whole
world
apart
from
the
refere
ha
seen
there
should
be
a
goal
at
old
trafford
that
just
reinforc
what
i
feel
there
should
be
video
evid
said
wenger
it
a
great
exampl
of
where
the
refere
could
have
ask
to
see
a
replay
and
would
have
seen
in
five
second
that
it
wa
a
goal
