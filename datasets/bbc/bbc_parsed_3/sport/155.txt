joy
a
red
take
control
liverpool
bo
rafael
benitez
wa
satisfi
after
hi
team
win
over
bayer
leverkusen
despit
conced
a
goal
in
the
last
minut
befor
the
game
if
you
had
said
the
score
will
be
i
would
have
happili
accept
that
said
benitez
but
you
must
realis
that
you
have
to
concentr
right
to
the
veri
last
second
of
a
game
at
thi
level
i
have
confid
that
we
can
complet
the
task
in
germani
i
am
alway
confid
and
we
must
be
posit
benitez
defend
goalkeep
jerzi
dudek
whose
failur
to
hold
on
to
dimitar
berbatov
weak
drive
allow
franca
to
score
with
the
last
kick
of
the
game
and
give
the
german
team
a
lifelin
for
the
second
leg
for
me
it
wa
not
jerzi
dudek
fault
ad
benitez
he
had
play
a
veri
good
game
and
had
we
score
our
other
chanc
nobodi
would
be
talk
about
about
their
goal
it
would
not
have
matter
if
we
had
score
our
other
chanc
it
would
not
have
been
worth
rememb
that
last
goal
in
my
opinion
jerzi
play
well
made
two
veri
fine
save
and
i
am
happi
with
him
if
we
lose
we
are
out
but
i
think
we
can
score
in
germani
certainli
one
and
that
will
make
all
the
differ
and
the
liverpool
bo
is
look
forward
to
have
skipper
steven
gerrard
who
wa
suspend
for
the
anfield
leg
back
for
the
return
in
germani
steven
gerrard
is
a
key
player
for
u
said
benitez
when
he
is
on
the
pitch
he
make
everyon
els
play
better
and
the
opposit
pay
special
attent
to
him
which
give
space
for
other
steven
is
one
of
the
best
player
in
the
world
but
i
need
a
team
that
is
not
about
just
one
player
there
must
be
player
on
the
pitch
all
do
well
