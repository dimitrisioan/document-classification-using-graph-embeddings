sympathis
with

bos
nigel
worthington
afterward
i
feel
a
bit
for
nigel
worthington
he
said
hi
team
have
got
great
charact
they
have
a
lot
of
drive
and
enthusiasm
i
know
it
is
a
killer
blow
for
norwich
but
i
realli
think
they
have
brought
someth
to
the
premiership
the
stadium
and
the
atmospher
is
great
it
is
just
a
tough
leagu
to

find
out
and
a
we
know
