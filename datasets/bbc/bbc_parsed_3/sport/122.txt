plenti
of
work
to
do
to
set
up
a
dream
tie
weve

but
you
cant
deni
it
excit
he
said
it
would
be
a
sellout
it
will
probabl
be
on
televis
we
have
financi
problem
and
the
revenu
it

bring
in
would
certainli
help
our
situat
were
happi
to

the
draw
but
weve
still

a
premiership

weve
got
to
beat
southampton
first
and
that
go
to
be
a
hard
game

be
some
celebr
welcom
the
opportun
to
face
unit
were
not
count
on
anyth
yet
he

it
is
obvious
go
to
be
a
difficult
replay
judg
by
the
way
brentford
came
back
at
u
on
saturday
and
the
fact
that
unit
have
come
out
of
the
hat
will
give
them
even
more
incent
but
ive
been
drawn
against
unit
so
mani
time
in
cup
and
beaten
them
at
both
bournemouth
and
west
ham
there
are
no
easi
tie
in
the
fa

sure
nobodi

forest
southampton
or
brentford
v
manchest
unit
bolton
