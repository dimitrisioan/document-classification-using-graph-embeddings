time
to
get
tough
on
friendli
for
an
intern
manag
a
friendli
provid
an
import
opportun
to
work
with
your
player
the
onli
problem
is
that
the
game
itself
can
often
be
a
farc
some
peopl
have
been
say
it
would
be
better
to
get
the
player
togeth
for
the
week
and
do
away
with
the
minut
at
the
end
i
would
say
it
whether
you
should
have
these
game
or
not
and
if
you
look
at
it
that
way
you
would
probabl
say
your
better
not
do
so
it
would
certainli
keep
club
manag
happi
a
it
would
reduc
the
risk
of
player
return
to
domest
duti
injur
but
intern
bos
will
tell
you
that
scrap
friendli
is
counterproduct
becaus
the
onli
way
for
a
team
to
get
better
is
by
play
the
more
you
play
togeth
the
easier
it
is
when
it
come
to
the
crunch
in
game
like
world
cup
quarterfin
against
brazil
often
in
friendli
though
a
manag
will
play
hi
strongest
side
for
the
first
minut
and
then
send
out
an
entir
differ
one
in
the
second
half
and
it
veri
difficult
for
ani
player
to
come
on
a
substitut
in
a
side
with
a
few
chang
let
alon
a
whole
team
worth
the
debat
will
rage
on
and
im
not
sure
there
is
a
satisfactori
solut
one
manag
who
ha
got
it
right
thi
week
is
walter
smith
the
new
scotland
manag
ha
decid
to
have
a
train
camp
instead
of
a
friendli
for
hi
first
intern
week
sinc
replac
berti
vogt
it
is
the
sort
of
move
you
would
expect
from
walter
who
is
a
canni
manag
the
player
have
had
such
a
hard
time
recent
that
he
is
better
off
get
them
togeth
in
a
relax
atmospher
and
tri
to
gener
some
team
spirit
befor
the
next
world
cup
qualifi
if
he
had
sent
them
out
on
wednesday
and
they
had
been
badli
beaten
it
would
have
done
them
no
good
whatsoev
john
toshack
ha
hi
first
game
in
charg
of
wale
and
it
will
be
import
for
him
to
get
a
decent
result
against
hungari
he
will
have
hi
own
idea
on
individu
and
how
to
play
and
will
probabl
look
more
at
the
perform
but
the
public
want
result
it
extrem
difficult
to
get
the
balanc
for
friendli
if
you
win
peopl
forget
them
but
if
you
lose
it
becom
a
stat
that
can
be
use
against
you
england
game
against
holland
is
a
good
exampl
it
look
like
a
good
opportun
to
tri
out
player
like
middlesbrough
winger
stewart
down
or
crystal
palac
striker
andi
johnson
but
you
have
got
to
rememb
svengoran
eriksson
side
were
given
a
lesson
by
spain
in
the
last
game
they
play
the
injuri
problem
in
defenc
should
at
least
give
the
like
of
we
brown
and
jami
carragh
a
chanc
to
impress
for
the
club
manag
it
will
simpli
be
a
case
of
wait
at
home
with
finger
cross
