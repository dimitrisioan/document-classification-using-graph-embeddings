you
dont
think
i
would
take
out
one
goalkeep
for
just
one
game
do
you
i
dont
do
that
i
have
to
give
him
a
run
for
a
few
game
it
just
that
i
dont
want
to
make
thi
stori
bigger
than
it
is
wenger
insist
he
ha
complet
faith
in
the
yearold
spaniard
who
wa
sign
last
summer
from
celta
vigo
a
backup
to
jen
lehmann
if
you
look
at
my
career
you
will
see
that
i
have
left
mani
big
player
out
for
a
long
time
ive
done
it
with
denni
bergkamp
kanu
everybodi
it
becaus
it
a
goalkeep
that
all
it
a
usual
situat
for
me
you
put
your
best
team
out
no
matter
who
it
is
for
me
it
wa
not
a
big
mistak
at
old
trafford
and
i
wasnt
alarm
by
what
happen
against
birmingham
either
it
noth
against
lehmann
i
think
he
a
great
keeper
a
is
almunia
you
can
onli
play
one
of
them
these
peopl
are
not
robot
they
have
good
period
and
le
good
period
just
becaus
lehmann
doesnt
play
for
two
or
three
week
or
longer
or
shorter
it
doesnt
mean
ive
lost
faith
in
him
but
former
arsen
keeper
david
seaman
belief
lehmann
ha
been
harshli
treat
seaman
told
the
daili
mail
jen
is
a
fantast
keeper
he
deserv
anoth
chanc
he
ha
made
a
few
mistak
but
on
form
he
deserv
to
be
the
firstteam
choic
with
arsen
hit
by
injuri
and
suspens
inexperienc
midfield
pair
of
mathieu
flamini
and
cesc
fabrega
will
line
up
against
rosenborg
but
wenger
is
confid
they
will
prove
more
than
capabl
it
put
a
lot
of
pressur
on
them
but
it
a
good
learn
process
said
wenger
im
not
worri
a
they
are
both
mental
strong
and
will
put
in
the
need
workrat
the
gunner
go
into
the
game
boost
by
the
news
that
defend
sol
campbel
is
on
the
verg
of
sign
a
new
deal
with
the
club
and
the
yearold
whose
current
contract
run
out
in
the
summer
ha
made
it
clear
he
is
determin
to
achiev
champion
leagu
success
with
arsen
campbel
said
it
mean
a
lot
to
me
to
go
through
it
everyth
we
want
to
carri
on
in
thi
competit
that
where
the
best
team
in
europ
are
to
be
in
there
play
against
these
guy
and
tri
to
win
the
trophi
is
the
first
thing
in
my
mind
meanwhil
thierri
henri
belief
he
will
be
blame
if
arsen
fail
to
qualifi
for
the
next
stage
of
the
champion
leagu
henri
will
captain
the
side
in
place
of
the
suspend
patrick
vieira
a
the
gunner
seek
the
requir
victori
over
rosenborg
and
the
striker
said
if
we
dont
win
and
we
go
out
of
the
competit
like
it
or
not
it
go
to
be
my
fault
that
the
way
it
is
if
the
team
dont
win
i
know
i
will
be
criticis
no
