hodgson
is
a
fierc
advoc
of
the
winter
break
employ
throughout
europ
although
not
in
england
where
the
champion
leagu
contend
have
plough
through
a
heavi
fixtur
list
but
hodgson
told
bbc
sport
that
while
he
belief
the
premiership
should
embrac
the
idea
he
doe
not
expect
it
to
cost
the
english
repres
in
the
last
of
the
champion
leagu
i
just
feel
it
is
veri
difficult
to
say
with
certainti
that
team
who
have
had
the
break
will
have
a
definit
edg
i
am
a
fervent
support
of
the
break
it
give
player
the
chanc
to
recharg
their
batteri
midway
through
the
season
which
some
suggest
will
give
team
an
advantag
in
the
champion
leagu
the
other
school
of
thought
suggest
have
a
break
then
come
back
to
it
put
you
at
a
disadvantag
the
bigger
discuss
around
the
winter
break
should
be
to
do
with
the
natur
of
footbal
today
the
need
of
footbal
player
and
the
way
the
premiership
ha
develop
rather
than
one
or
two
match
in
the
champion
leagu
in
februari
hodgson
belief
a
winter
break
carri
mani
advantag
explain
a
i
said
it
is
the
perfect
chanc
to
recharg
batteri
and
certainli
if
i
wa
still
a
manag
in
england
i
would
be
support
ani
call
for
it
introduct
in
preseason
you
get
a
lot
of
enthusiasm
and
energi
but
by
the
time
you
get
toward
christma
mani
player
have
also
play
plenti
of
intern
match
for
club
and
countri
and
travel
a
lot
find
themselv
get
veri
jade
the
break
give
them
a
chanc
to
recov
that
energi
and
enthusiasm
and
perhap
more
importantli
recov
their
mental
strength
dure
the
break
and
get
readi
for
the
game
ahead
the
mental
side
is
by
far
the
most
import
thing
hodgson
ad
the
length
of
break
can
vari
in
itali
the
break
wa
veri
short
you
just
took
christma
and
new
year
it
wa
so
short
you
didnt
do
anyth
you
gave
the
player
a
week
or
day
off
then
you
were
train
for
a
week
or
day
and
then
went
into
a
game
if
it
is
longer
it
is
import
those
respons
for
physic
fit
give
the
player
a
programm
to
follow
to
ensur
the
physic
strength
they
have
accumul
stay
with
them
and
hodgson
belief
a
winter
break
would
be
a
posit
step
in
the
premiership
he
said
if
we
talk
about
footbal
at
elit
level
which
the
premiership
is
then
i
would
support
a
winter
break
if
you
examin
the
demand
of
the
premier
leagu
and
in
particular
on
player
who
play
intern
footbal
for
their
club
and
countri
then
a
break
would
do
them
the
world
of
good
physic
and
mental
