confirm
their
posit
at
the
premiership
summit
prove
that
they
now
have
everyth
in
place
to
mount
seriou
challeng
on
all
front
thi
season
they
have
got
strength
in
depth
great
player
an
outstand
manag
in
jose
mourinho
and
financ
no
other
club
in
the
world
can
match
all
they
need
to
add
now
is
the
big
prize
which
a
we
all
know
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
all
one
thing
is
certain
they
have
put
themselv
in
a
posit
to
make
that
leap
to
success
veri
impress
inde
they
beat
a
veri
tough
everton
at
stamford
bridg
won
at
newcastl
in
the
carl
cup
and
then
won
at
fulham
which
wa
a
great
result
given
that
they
had
been
show
good
form
a
i
said
win
the
major
honour
is
the
hardest
task
of
all
but
in
mourinho
they
have
a
manag
who
will
make
it
a
whole
lot
easier
to
handl
the
anticip
and
expect
that
will
come
their
way
now
mourinho
ha
won
the
biggest
club
prize
of
all
the
champion
leagu
and
that
track
record
and
confid
transmit
itself
to
top
player
it
is
a
priceless
commod
noon
can
be
anyth
other
than
highlyimpress
by
mourinho
he
is
regard
a
a
touch
arrog
by
some
peopl
and
mayb
he
can
appear
that
way
but
he
ha
the
silverwar
to
back
up
the
talk
mourinho
doesnt
simpli
talk
a
good
game
he
won
some
veri
big
game
such
a
the
champion
leagu
final
with
porto
some
may
criticis
hi
talk
but
the
word
are
back
up
with
action
ive
also
found
him
to
be
veri
realist
whenev
ive
heard
him
he
spent
a
lot
of
money
and
it
seem
to
be
work
and
we
should
rememb
lot
of
manag
have
spent
money
and
it
ha
not
work
the
buy
are
now
integr
and
in
arjen
robben
he
ha
the
player
who
is
give
them
that
extra
dimens
in
the
earli
game
he
wa
slaughter
for
defens
tactic
and
yet
he
wa
win
game
you
can
not
win
titl
earli
on
in
the
season
but
you
can
certainli
lose
them
and
those
point
on
the
board
were
vital
i
also
thought
the
critic
wa
veri
harsh
becaus
even
though
they
were
not
score
goal
they
were
creat
chanc
by
the
hat
now
they
are
take
those
chanc
have
the
doubl
threat
of
robben
and
damien
duff
and
thing
are
look
good
i
just
wonder
if
they
lack
a
predat
particularli
with
didier
drogba
injur
he
wa
start
to
look
the
part
befor
he
wa
sidelin
but
you
have
to
feel
if
chelsea
had
a
ruud
van
nistelrooy
they
would
be
even
more
of
a
safe
bet
for
the
titl
chelsea
also
have
all
the
tool
to
go
far
in
the
champion
leagu
i
felt
they
would
never
have
a
better
chanc
than
last
season
but
they
have
swept
all
befor
them
in
europ
so
far
thi
season
it
will
now
be
veri
interest
to
see
how
mourinho
prioritis
thing
but
hi
life
will
be
made
easier
by
the
size
of
chelsea
squad
i
have
said
i
believ
chelsea
would
win
the
leagu
thi
season
even
when
arsen
were
fli
at
the
start
and
i
have
seen
noth
to
make
me
chang
me
mind
if
anyth
what
i
have
seen
ha
confirm
my
earli
impress
and
chelsea
would
have
taken
encourag
from
arsen
rocki
defens
display
at
spur
even
though
they
ran
out
winner
mourinho
had
hi
say
on
that
game
complain
fivefour
is
a
hockey
score
not
a
footbal
score
in
a
threeagainstthre
train
match
if
the
score
reach
i
send
the
player
back
to
the
dress
room
a
they
are
not
defend
properli
so
to
get
a
result
like
that
in
a
game
of
against
is
disgrac
on
a
more
seriou
note
it
wa
a
game
that
mere
confirm
the
import
of
sol
campbel
to
arsen
much
critic
ha
been
aim
at
pascal
cygan
but
i
believ
the
problem
lie
with
the
absenc
of
campbel
and
it
overal
effect
on
arsen
defenc
confid
is
a
crucial
factor
in
defend
when
you
start
conced
goal
you
suddenli
get
a
chill
in
the
bone
everi
time
the
ball
come
into
the
penalti
area
you
think
oh
no
then
find
your
worst
fear
confirm
arsen
need
to
revers
the
process
with
or
without
campbel
and
get
some
clean
sheet
on
the
board
but
the
return
of
campbel
is
key
he
solidifi
the
unit
ha
pace
and
is
power
in
the
air
and
on
the
deck
he
is
vastli
experienc
and
ha
a
calm
influenc
on
all
around
him
campbel
pull
it
all
togeth
at
the
back
and
get
the
defenc
play
a
a
unit
chelsea
have
no
such
problem
at
present
which
is
whi
i
would
still
place
my
money
on
them
to
edg
out
arsen
a
champion
thi
season
