prof
doubter
wrong
thi
wont
go
down
a
one
of
the
greatest
marathon
of
paula
career
but
a
a
test
of
charact
it
wa
the
toughest
race
she
ever
taken
part
in
a
win
in
the
new
york
marathon
doesnt
make
up
for
the
disappoint
of
athen
in
ani
shape
or
form
but
it
will
offer
hope
and
reassur
for
next
year
if
paula
last
experi
of
the
year
had
been
athen
it
would
have
been
veri
difficult
to
look
forward
with
ani
optim
she
can
now
draw
a
line
under
thi
year
and
make
plan
about
her
futur
even
if
shed
lost
thi
race
there
would
have
been
a
lot
of
posit
to
take
out
of
it
she
know
she
can
dig
deep
if
she
need
to
it
wa
a
strong
field
with
a
number
of
the
girl
go
into
the
race
with
expect
of
win
and
although
two
hour
minut
wasnt
one
of
paula
best
time
it
wasnt
far
off
the
record
on
a
difficult
cours
i
wa
speak
to
paula
in
the
leadup
to
thi
race
and
she
said
that
in
mani
way
she
wa
face
a
nowin
situat
she
thought
that
if
she
won
peopl
would
say
whi
couldnt
she
do
that
in
athen
and
if
she
lost
peopl
would
say
her
career
wa
over
and
a
lot
of
peopl
were
wonder
what
would
happen
if
paula
wa
forc
to
drop
out
of
thi
race
a
she
did
in
the
marathon
and
m
in
athen
but
that
wa
never
on
the
card
she
might
have
been
beaten
but
she
would
have
kept
run
the
reason
she
wa
forc
to
pull
out
in
athen
the
niggl
injuri
her
lack
of
energi
and
the
oppress
condit
werent
at
play
here
the
onli
question
wa
what
posit
she
could
finish
in
most
import
of
all
despit
all
the
hype
in
the
medium
ahead
of
thi
race
there
were
never
doubt
in
paula
mind
if
she
wasnt
confid
she
wouldnt
have
run
after
all
if
your
the
best
in
the
world
at
an
event
youll
alway
have
expect
of
win
now
paula

take
part
in
the
run
