the
italian
they
made
u
work
veri
hard
for
our
victori

good
and
they
prove
again
that
they
are
get
better
and
better
a
the
year
go
by
it
is
by
far
the
strongest
italian
team
that
we
have
face
we
knew
all
along
that
we
would
be
a
huge
threat
particularli
the
first
game
in
the
championship
it
wa
not
like
the
day
gone
by
when
you
could
get
score
on
the
board
earli
we
had
to
work
our
sock
off
and
tri
and
build
our
score
gradual
it
wa
realli
hard
work
out
there
and
the
player
have
plenti
of
bump
and
bruis
to
prove
it
im
not
too
bad
but
there
are
one
or
two
other
who
will
be
feel
it
a
bit
on
monday
morn
in
the
back
we
were
not
frustrat
at
such
but
the
new
ruck
law
were
a
littl
bit
problemat
the
differ
interpret
between
the
refere
and
the
player
wa
a
littl
difficult
but
we
manag
to
get
the
ball
in
our
hand
and
i
got
a
tri
near
the
end
of
the
first
half
it
alway
good
to
score
it
wa
great
work
by
brian
and
i
alway
knew
i
had
score
even
though
it
went
upstair
to
the
video
refere
eddi
osullivan
wa
veri
calm
at
halftim
even
though
we
were
onli
ahead
he
spell
out
what
we
need
to
do
and
advoc
get
the
ball
out
of
our
own
territori
that
new
ruck
law
made
it
a
bit
more
difficult
to
get
out
of
our
own
half
we
were
penalis
a
lot
at
the
breakdown
and
if
they
had
kick
all
their
chanc
at
goal
we
would
have
been
behind
at
the
break
so
realli
we
went
back
to
play
a
territori
game
and
simplifi
thing
and
have
more
patienc
on
the
ball
everi
one
wa
a
littl
down
after

the
injuri
to
brian
and
gordon

yet
we
do
not
know
the
full
extent
of
the
injuri
but
it
doe
not
that
good
now
we
have
to
focu
on
scotland

against
the
french
on
saturday
it
could
so
easili
have
gone
their
way
but
for
a
coupl
of
decis

will
be
under
no
illus
