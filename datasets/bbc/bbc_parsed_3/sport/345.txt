touch
and
go
said
andrew
hi
recoveri
is
go
veri
well
and
the
key
now
is
how
he
is
reintroduc
to
play
and
with
it
goalkick
he
will
probabl
have
to
come
off

bench
to

and
it
would
be
ridicul
and
irrespons
to
put
him
straight
back
into
a
test
match
we
cant
afford
to
get
it
wrong
with
a
knee
injuri
we
