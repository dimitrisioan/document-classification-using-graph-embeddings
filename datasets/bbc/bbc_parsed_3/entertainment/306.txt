said
he
had
wonder
whether

decemb
catastroph
i
question
whether
i
should
come
when
such
a
tragedi
had
happen
the
british
actor
said
i
thought
it
might
be
in
rather
bad
tast
but
then
i
spoke
to
the
organis
and
i
wa
encourag
to
let
life
go
on
now
ive
come
here
im
veri
glad
what
impress
me
about
thai
cultur
is
they
get
over
these
thing
far
quicker
than
we
do
in
the
west
he
continu
basic
i
wa
invit
here
by
thailand
if
they
still
want
you
to
come
you
should
now
in
it
third
year
bangkok
is
a
rel
recent
addit
to
the
hectic
film
festiv
calendar
and
while
it
ha
yet
to
attain
the
statur
of
more
establish
event
held
in
hong
kong
tokyo
and
pusan
in
south
korea
mr
prater
predict
it
will
soon
becom
their
equal
it
grown
aw
fast
in
three
year
mayb
too
fast
he
conced
weve
had
some
bump
in
the
road
but
that
onli
becaus
the
festiv
is
still
a
babi
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
in
five
year
thi
will
be
the
top
asian
film
festiv
in
the
world
the
golden
kinnare
will
be
award
on
