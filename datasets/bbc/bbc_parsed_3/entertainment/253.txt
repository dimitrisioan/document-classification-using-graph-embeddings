you
must

it
good
if

sort

thing
but
realli
listen
to
angel
on

thi
morn
when
i
wa
drive
into

had
not

it
for
a
while
i

the
public
have
short
memori
when
it
come
to

for
the

there
must
be
more
than
a
dozen
song
in

that
deserv
thi

more
it
not
exactli
groundbreak
presum
the

that

is
is
pretti
low
im
actual
embarrass
to

if
that
is
the

we
have

rubbish
angel
is
a
aw
piec
of
sentiment
claptrap
it
music
and
lyric
inept
and
fantast
overr
a
bit
like
mr
william
himself
thi
result
isnt
veri
surpris
though
the
brit
ha
a
long
histori
of
celebr
rubbish
music
best
of
the
last
year
mayb
cun
to
make
the
timescal
not
includ
stairway
to
heaven
or
bohemian
rhapsodi
but
it
doe
kind
of
make
it
a
bit
of
a
hollow
award
realli
not
much
competit
in
the
last
year
after
all
it
alright
for
a
pop
song
but
the
best
song
of
the
last
year
there
is
no
way
on
earth
that
song
should
have
been
vote
the
best
of
the
last
yearsit
a
travesti
rubbish
who
vote
it
for
it
to
be
includ
in
ani
list
i
am
a
regular
listen
to
radio
but
i
dont
recal
the
invit
to
vote
for
thi
bland
slushi
rubbish
which
might
appeal
to
the
mass
who
wouldnt
know
a
good
song
if
it
jump
up
and
bit
them
on
the
nose
but
is
certainli
not
the
best
song
of
the
last
year
how
depress
and
just
when
we
thought
manufactur
pop
wa
on
the
way
out
where
on
earth
did
thi
dread
list
appear
from
while
i
am
biass
in
that
i
thought
love
will
tear
u
apart
should
have
won
in
all
serious
i
think
that
the
best
song
of
the
last
year
should
not
includ
song
le
than
year
old
a
that
would
exclud
song
which
are
popular
becaus
of
novelti
then
again
well
done
robbi
good
show
youv
got
to
be
kid
angel
is
a
great
song
but
not
the
best
song
of
the
last
year
onli
the
best
song
to
be
up
for
nomin
at
the
brit
i
think
angel
is
a
great
song
and
deserv
to
be
in
the
run
up
for
thi
award
but
i
dont
think
it
the
best
song
from
the
past
year
right
enough
it
is
better
than
some
of
the
other
in
thi
catergori
for
exampl
what
wa
will
young
do
be
nomin
in
the
first
place
he
is
alright
but
the
song
isnt
that
good
im
happi
for
robbi
himself
though
best
song
in
the
last
year
what
a
joke
think
of
all
the
great
rock
and
pop
song
releas
in
the
s
and
pretti
much
all
of
them
are
better
than
angel
phil
collin
doesnt
deserv
award
for
all
the
good
song
he
wrote
angel
is
an
overr
song
that
got
tiresom
even
befor
you
had
finish
listen
to
it
soppi
rubbish
at
best
hope
manufactur
rubbish
will
die
down
soon
and
let
the
real
artist
who
work
hard
for
there
glori
receiv
award
so
boringli
obviou
and
typic
of
the
bland
natur
of
mainstream
music
in
britain
today
for
me
it
proof
that
music
and
democraci
just
dont
mix
still
at
least
it
wasnt
will
young
oh
it
all
just
a
bit
of
fun
peopl
take
these
award
too
serious
robbi
ha
million
of
loyal
fan
while
even
nonfan
know
the
word
to
angel
him
win
obvious
reflect
who
vote
in
these
award
person
i
want
will
young
to
win
but
that
wa
not
realli
due
to
hi
music
talent
i
hate
the
song
all
it
bring
back
is
memori
of
school
disco
and
noon
to
slowdanc
with
i
agre
about
angel
i
never
get
fed
up
hear
it
whenev
the
song
come
on
the
radio
i
turn
the
radio
up
smile
and
sing
along
veri
badli
that
is
whi
the
radio
ha
to
be
turn
up
to
drown
my
voic
out
the
song
make
me
calm
and
seren
and
happi
well
done
robbi
i
think
that
although
robbi
william
is
a
good
perform
that
angel
isnt
realli
that
good
a
song
it
certainli
isnt
anywher
near
a
good
a
love
will
tear
u
apart
by
joy
divis
or
wuther
height
by
kate
bush
angel
is
a
fantast
song
all
credit
to
robbi
william
and
guy
chamber
it
a
song
that
will
be
play
forev
and
bridg
all
age
group
robbi
did
in
no
way
deserv
that
mantl
whenev
we
have
these
award
it
is
alway
artist
from
the
past
five
year
that
seem
to
win
the
best
of
the
bestw
forget
about
the
late
s
and
earli
s
for
exampl
they
werent
cool
at
the
time
but
becaus
they
are
cool
again
now
show
that
the
song
have
greater
longev
than
peopl
think
ye
angel
is
the
best
song
sinc
the
past
year
becaus
it
touch
the
soul
a
it
carri
a
lot
of
mean
ive
alway
dislik
angel
intens
i
believ
it
to
be
symbol
of
the
gener
capac
of
british
preteen
teen
and
middl
age
woman
to
accept
low
qualiti
low
aspir
music
a
classic
songwrit
it
orribl
it
seem
obviou
to
me
that
peopl
who
like
robbi
are
peopl
who
dont
particularli
like
music
all
that
much
folk
without
collect
folk
who
have
never
engag
in
that
mad
one
experi
when
fall
under
the
spell
of
pop
music
angel
add
noth
it
is
mere
an
irrit
distract
a
wasp
that
refus
to
go
away
on
a
summer
afternoon
picnic
what
a
dread
result
if
you
vote
for
it
you
should
feel
asham
of
yourself
you
probabl
onli
know
a
dozen
song
or
so
dont
you
so
where
do
get
off
appli
thi
uninform
filter
and
cast
thi
ridicul
vote
booo
hiss
angel
best
song
you
are
kid
right
last
five
year
i
might
be
will
to
accept
but
no
way
did
whoever
vote
for
thi
actual
have
ani
music
knowledg
prior
to
say
realli
quit
insult
to
the
british
music
industri
of
the
past
quarter
of
a
centuri
no
surpris
about
robbi
william
consid
the
list
where
on
earth
did
the
nomin
list
come
from
compil
by
an
eleven
yearold
girl
perhap
i
mean
will
young
come
on
what
a
load
of
crap
best
song
in
the
last
year
i
dont
think
so
what
about
all
the
real
artist
out
there
over
the
last
year
the
list
is
endless
but
robbi
william
doesnt
even
come
close
what
a
joke
that
song
ha
becom
such
a
bane
to
me
that
i
have
develop
a
pavlovian
respons
to
the
word
angel
where
i
thrash
around
and
scream
no
no
no
no
no
until
someon
tell
me
the
radio
off
whi
a
halfbak
cheesi
ditti
like
angel
which
ha
becom
the
anthem
for
million
of
romant
sop
think
how
mani
time
it
wa
sung
on
pop
idol
for
exampl
and
by
whom
should
be
vote
the
best
song
of
the
past
year
is
beyond
me
if
thi
is
the
song
against
which
all
other
are
judg
then
musician
may
a
well
give
up
whi
do
we
reward
mediocr
so
highli
in
thi
countri
the
initi
list
wa
veri
weak
anyway
but
angel
the
best
song
of
the
last
year
i
think
not
i
didnt
realiz
radio
had
so
mani
listen
under
the
age
of
peopl
have
such
short
memori
a
great
song
ye
but
the
best
of
the
last
year
not
a
chanc
i
think
the
person
a
oppos
to
the
song
ha
been
vote
for
here
the
great
british
public
at
work
again
it
a
mediocr
sentiment
and
safe
song
grant
it
not
too
bad
either
but
can
it
stand
up
against
anyth
by
the
smith
in
particular
how
soon
is
now
or
anyth
from
the
stone
rose
first
album
nope
no
becaus
im
not
femal
and
im
not
ok
i
like
robbi
and
angel
is
a
decent
song
but
it
is
no
way
the
best
song
of
the
past
year
the
shortlist
wasnt
great
but
him
win
it
is
a
joke
predict
and
laughabl
the
success
of
angel
at
thi
year
brit
reflect
poorli
on
the
state
of
british
music
over
the
last
year
the
british
public
are
brainwash
by
the
corpor
pulp
that
is
presnet
to
them
a
cut
edg
music
and
true
talent
is
be
sadli
miss
whilst
angel
is
a
popular
song
it
is
not
even
the
best
song
in
robbi
repertoir
never
mind
best
song
of
the
last
year
i
am
a
huge
robbi
fan
and
love
that
song
but
i
think
there
are
a
lot
more
outstand
song
music
out
there
that
influenc
music
today
unfortun
they
were
left
out
of
the
list
have
radio
listen
even
heard
of
joy
divis
a
band
who
through
two
album
have
had
a
bigger
impact
on
music
and
continu
to
do
so
over
the
last
year
than
robbi
william
ever
will
no
doubt
about
it
there
not
a
song
done
by
anyon
with
more
emot
and
feel
some
peopl
will
adopt
their
slightli
snobbi
stanc
but
angel
ha
hit
home
with
a
far
larger
audienc
than
ani
other
song
it
should
have
been
joy
divisionthos
guy
have
play
an
influenti
part
in
shape
modern
day
music
while
angel
remain
yet
anoth
pop
song
i
sincer
do
not
believ
that
in
year
from
now
the
most
influenti
artist
will
argu
that
robbi
william
inspir
their
art
in
the
way
that
the
byrd
the
beatl
and
nick
drake
have
done
for
music
today
ye
i
think
it
a
brilliantli
written
song
with
differ
mean
to
differ
peopl
there
were
other
great
song
in
the
categori
but
somebodi
had
to
win
robbi
wa
a
deserv
winner
i
am
astound
that
such
a
secondr
record
ha
beaten
such
a
line
up
of
amaz
song
it
a
terribl
song
vote
for
by
the
mass
who
dont
have
the
brain
to
appreci
innov
and
excit
music
the
best
song
of
the
past
year
realli
come
on
thi
is
sure
a
joke
no
i
think
i
need
a
long
lie
down
it
just
go
to
show
that
the
british
public
do
not
have
a
clue
about
good
qualiti
music
when
they
pick
robbi
william
over
the
beauti
talent
kate
bush
and
joy
divis
i
suppos
it
confirm
one
thing
the
british
public
are
consist
dull
lt
no
offenc
robbi
but
pleeeas
there
must
be
a
thousand
better
song
than
a
formul
cheesi
pop
song
for
kid
no
one
agre
with
thi
and
quit
frankli
it
is
an
embarass
to
the
integr
of
british
music
and
a
further
nail
in
the
coffin
i
think
robbi
deserv
it
he
ha
been
the
most
icon
of
ani
star
we
have
had
in
britain
sinc
john
lennon
and
is
an
idol
to
million
worldwid
anybodi
who
say
he
doesnt
deserv
it
is
jealou
of
hi
success
the
onli
real
challeng
wa
queen
but
hey
anoth
one
bite
the
dust
obvious
all
the
karaok
singer
in
the
uk
vote
for
it
if
thi
is
the
best
song
of
the
last
year
then
the
british
music
industri
is
in
troubl
sure
robbi
is
talent
and
produc
excel
materi
but
thi
is
not
the
best
record
a
sad
day
for
music
it
not
the
type
of
music
i
normal
like
but
even
a
a
diehard
rock
fan
i
recognis
that
it
is
a
good
song
and
appela
to
most
peopl
that
whi
it
ha
been
vote
best
song
of
the
last
year
it
a
good
allround
just
like
robbi
best
song
in
year
sinc
im
confus
angel
isnt
a
bad
song
it
a
nice
catchi
formula
anthem
that
tick
all
the
box
but
thi
is
not
great
music
if
anyth
it
regress
bland
even
i
suppos
it
just
more
evid
of
how
redund
the
brit
award
have
becom
grant
angel
is
a
good
song
howev
it
realli
wasnt
up
against
ani
other
proper
competit
the
queen
song
wa
lacklust
and
apart
from
kate
bush
the
other
choic
were
pathet
also
whi
werent
the
stone
there
david
bowi
etc
there
are
so
mani
greater
song
than
angelsi
wonder
if
it
wa
simpli
the
fact
that
robbi
wasnt
get
more
award
so
they
had
to
make
one
up
for
him
best
song
of
the
last
year
what
a
ridiculu
concept
and
an
even
more
ridicul
winner
sigh
on
the
upsid
at
least
it
wasnt
bohemian
rhapsodi
for
which
we
should
all
be
thank
angel
is
without
doubt
a
great
song
but
i
realli
dont
think
it
deserv
the
titl
of
best
song
in
yearsperhap
the
vote
had
more
to
do
with
teenag
opinion
on
robbi
goodlook
than
the
actual
song
dont
get
me
wrong
im
not
disput
hi
look
but
there
are
more
deserv
winner
it
would
have
been
a
travesti
had
angel
not
won
without
angel
robbi
william
may
well
not
be
where
he
is
now
and
britain
would
have
been
depriv
of
one
of
it
most
charismat
and
talent
perform
artist
it
ha
to
be
seen
perform
live
with
peopl
sing
along
to
be
fulli
appreci
well
done
rob
i
find
it
hard
to
believ
that
angel
is
the
best
we
have
to
show
for
the
past
year
im
rapidli
redifin
best
in
my
own
head
now
to
mean
most
gratuit
play
at

becaus
peopl
think
it
ha
deep
mean
what
about

blur
oasi

not
onli

someth
differ
whi
must
best
alway
come
down
to
most
commerci
popular
ive
noth
against
robbi
i
actual
like
hi
music
but
how
can
thi
possibl
be
the
best
song
from
the
last
year
the
brit
ha
prove
to
be
noth
more
than
a
bargain
tool
between
the
pop
mogul
to
boost
band
profil
and
record
sale
the
same
go
with
the
scissor
sister
i
think
thi
is
a
superb
record
and
thoroughli
deserv
the
newcom
award
but
the
album
come
no
where
near
u
new
record
neither
are
they
in
the
same
leagu
onc
again
there
have
been
some
baffl
discis
made
they
are
not
for
artis
reason
but
for
profit
no
surpris
realli
it
vote
for
by
the
gener
public
sinc
when
did
they
have
tast
in
music
person
i
find
angel
by
robbi
william
to
be
one
of
the
most
irrit
song
i
have
ever
heard
it
absolut
deserv
to
win
it
is
a
song
that
ha
unit
the
gener
and
will
continu
to
be
play
for
mani
year
to
come
it
an
absolut
joke
howev
most
of
the
origin
were
veri
poor
choic
a
well
all
in
all
a
pretti
pointless
exercis
the
song
is
overplay
and
oversentiment
out
of
the
rather
poor
five
choic
that
were
left
it
should
have
gone
to
either
joy
divis
or
queen
i
suppos
we
should
be
thank
that
it
didnt
end
up
in
the
hand
of
will
young
though
although
it
ha
nostalgia
valu
there
is
no
way
it
deserv
to

everybodi
know
the
word
to
bohemian
rhapsodi
noth
compar
u
etc
much
better
song
and
more
timeless
give
it
to
someon
with
real
talent
although
angel
is
a
good
song
i
think
that
anyon
with
the
slightest
music
tast
will
realis
that
thi
is
not
the
best
song
of
the
last
year
thi
is
just
anoth
exampl
of
record
compani
manipul
to
keep
an
artist
in
the
public
eye
whi
not
give
him
an
award
for
the
greatest
pair
of

if
that
all
it
