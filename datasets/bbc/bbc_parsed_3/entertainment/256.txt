brit
debat
over
urban
music
joss
stone
a
yearold
soul
singer
from
devon
beat
dizze
rascal
jamelia
lemar
and
the
street
to
win
best
british
urban
act
at
the
brit
award
her
victori
ha
reignit
the
debat
about
what
urban
music
is
im
not
realli
comfort
with
the
word
urban
it
a
word
that
been
manufactur
in
thi
countri
and
america
to
describ
black
music
the
word
urban
seem
to
cover
such
a
broad
rang
of
black
music
that
it
wrong
how
far
are
the
brit
remov
from
innerc
music
and
what
peopl
are
do
it
so
far
remov
that
i
dont
expect
them
to
get
it
bang
on
the
music
industri
isnt
champion
music
from
our
particular
genr
veri
well
anyway
peopl
dont
feel
like
that
anyth
to
do
with
u
i
dont
feel
like
urban
music
just
been
celebr
by
joss
stone
win
or
her
be
nomin
or
by
the
brit
acknowledg
that
there
an
urban
music
scene
becaus
it
all
a
kick
in
the
teeth
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
not
realli
relev
if
joss
stone
is
the
closest
thing
that
they
feel
comfort
champion
becaus
of
what
she
look
like
and
how
she
sound
and
who
she
sign
to
then
so
be
it
it
got
noth
to
do
with
what
realli
go
on
urban
a
a
genr
is
veri
broad
if
you
look
underneath
urban
there
are
a
number
of
core
element
that
includ
hiphop
rb
garag
and
into
that
obvious
come
soul
joss
stone
is
a
soul
artist
her
first
album
wa
call
the
soul
session
so
urban
is
a
veri
broad
brushstrok
that
is
the
umbrella
over
the
top
of
subgenr
and
there
are
offshoot
of
all
of
those
joss
stone
ha
had
amaz
success
in
the
u
given
that
she
a
uk
artist
what
ha
realli
captur
everybodi
imagin
is
that
here
you
have
a
yearold
from
devon
with
a
voic
to
die
for
and
a
bunch
of
realli
realli
good
tune
and
she
look
good
i
think
that
what
done
it
the
award
for
best
british
urban
act
wa
vote
for
by
viewer
of
mtv
base
i
dont
think
joss
wa
not
a
worthi
winner
she
make
soul
music
and
that
definit
come
under
the
categori
of
what
we
describ
a
urban
the
fact
that
she
from
devon
is
the
interest
thing
becaus
most
of
the
music
we
cover
is
made
in
larg
citi
and
she
liter
rural
the
great
thing
about
urban
music
is
that
there
a
big
rang
if
there
is
some
sort
of
root
with
black
music
or
danc
music
in
britain
i
think
that
where
you
can
call
it
urban
that
where
thi
new
subcategori
or
ubercategori
ha
come
from
joss
stone
is
certainli
not
old
enough
to
have
had
some
of
the
experi
of
an
older
soul
singer
but
you
couldnt
argu
that
she
wa
be
inauthent
with
her
emot
it
is
come
from
somewher
genuin
it
ha
to
come
across
a
real
that
the
onli
cutoff
point
we
have
here
and
that
the
onli
way
by
which
we
judg
peopl
what
urban
mean
to
u
a
an
organis
is
the
polit
correct
term
to
describ
music
which
origin
from
a
black
background
music
should
becom
inclus
and
if
we
are
fight
for
a
multicultur
britain
then
we
should
be
fight
for
inclus
rather
than
exclus
if
joss
stone
can
be
accept
within
the
urban
music
commun
i
think
act
from
other
ethnic
do
classic
music
and
rock
should
be
accept
too
race
doesnt
make
a
differ
if
everyon
is
includ
out
of
all
the
award
dish
out
yesterday
im
still
tri
to
find
out
what
peopl
of
other
race
receiv
ani
sort
of
recognit
or
award
a
type
of
music
especi
street
music
that
origin
from
a
citi
and
typic
reflect
or
is
characterist
of
urban
life
she
might
not
be
urban
but
when
did
rb
becom
the
hip
hop
taint
thing
it
is
now
rb
stand
for
rhythm
and
blue
rememb
that
joss
stone
is
rubbish
is
certain
if
anyon
deserv
to
win
an
award
for
urban
music
i
think
probabl
should
includ
hiphop
soul
funk
at
least
but
not
rock
or
pop
thi
year
it
the
street
although
dizze
rascal
stake
a
good
claim
she
definit
deserv
to
win
a
prize
joss
stone
album
are
quit
simpli
amaz
easili
better
than
anyth
els
that
wa
releas
last
year
thi
whole
debat
about
what
is
urban
what
isnt
urban
is
complet
pointless
and
probabl
fuel
by
urban
artist
who
werent
nomin
or
didnt
win
i
cant
see
whi
peopl
cant
just
congratul
her
for
the
talent
that
she
is
she
did
deserv
it
but
i
agre
with
the
comment
about
urban
music
it
a
stupid
phrase
and
particularli
british
in
the
state
they
tend
to
use
hip
hop
and
rb
if
i
say
hip
hop
here
a
lot
of
peopl
have
no
idea
what
im
talk
about
veri
strang
what
in
a
name
a
rose
by
ani
other
name
etc
if
peopl
want
to
call
it
urban
whi
not
if
we
realli
analys
it
the
term
danc
music
is
mislead
becaus
it
doesnt
describ
everyth
you
can
danc
to
whilst
i
agre
that
the
term
urban
is
open
to
interpret
it
strike
me
a
simpli
weird
that
joss
stone
ha
won
urban
to
me
is
what
i
hear
be
play
in
parti
in
the
inner
citi
i
live
in
brixton
and
have
never
heard
the
soul
session
pump
out
of
of
a
bass
heavi
sound
system
in
ani
parti
ive
been
to
good
luck
to
joss
stone
let
celebr
her
victori
let
also
question
whi
with
artist
so
success
and
talent
a
jamelia
lemar
kany
west
dizze
rascal
alicia
key
and
outkast
we
didnt
see
a
singl
black
artist
on
stage
collect
an
award
so
what
your
say
is
that
ani
music
that
ha
black
heritag
is
not
allow
to
be
sung
by
anyon
who
isnt
black
and
if
it
is
then
they
shouldnt
be
acknowledg
for
it
even
if
theyr
pretti
dam
good
at
it
she
ha
an
amaz
voic
and
won
good
on
her
oh
but
she
not
black
well
let
make
her
feel
real
bad
about
it
then
how
dare
she
though
hang
on
didnt
the
socal
public
vote
on
thi
one
thi
idea
of
pigeonhol
whatev
is
popular
at
the
time
is
no
differ
than
what
wa
happen
in
the
s
and
s
in
relat
to
what
jazz
wa
the
medium
then
call
anyth
that
had
a
swing
beat
syncop
melodi
or
soul
feel
jazz
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
artist
it
would
mean
that
blue
would
be
put
in
the
same
mould
a
bebop
cool
and
ragtim
all
veri
differ
style
at
that
time
jazz
wa
and
remain
such
a
massiv
misunderstood
term
and
so
what
of
urban
music
in
truth
it
a
lazi
term
to
categoris
music
that
you
dont
realli
understand
soul
and
garag
are
world
apart
music
marvin
gay
v
tuff
jam
but
no
doubt
have
their
connect
if
we
just
let
the
music
speak
for
itself
and
not
judg
the
success
of
an
artist
by
the
number
of
award
won
then
mayb
we
can
enjoy
the
music
for
what
it
is
rather
than
what
it
repres
i
demand
a
prize
for
rural
music
suck
to
the
citi
it
way
better
out
here
we
have
hay
for
one
thing
exclud
her
from
what
ha
becom
known
a
urban
music
would
be
a
bad
a
exclud
lenni
kravitz
or
hendrix
from
rock
music
for
be
black
sure
i
dont
understand
the
point
that
ty
is
make
if
lemar
who
make
music
which
is
le
soul
than
joss
work
won
he
might
have
said
noth
btw
im
black
too
how
can
she
be
urban
if
she
spent
most
of
her
life
in
the
devon
countrysid
nonsens
i
love
joss
to
bit
and
dont
care
what
her
brand
is
it
amaz
music
full
stop
stop
pute
it
all
in
bracket
and
let
just
call
it
music
and
let
especi
drop
the
black
urban
tag
nearli
all
music
came
from
black
origin
thi
just
set
an
exampl
that
it
is
ok
to
pigeonhol
peopl
and
their
music
by
their
colour
sure
the
point
of
have
an
urban
music
categori
is
simpli
to
acknowledg
artist
that
are
make
what
is
histor
consid
urban
music
irrelev
of
the
colour
of
their
skin
or
where
they
origin
from
joss
stone
is
simpli
sing
a
certain
type
of
music
that
can
be
consid
urban
in
style
just
a
someon
from
an
inner
citi
and
inde
not
from
the
usa
could
sing
countri
music
if
that
person
wa
good
at
it
and
authent
in
sound
would
we
criticis
it
be
refer
to
a
countri
music
or
the
artist
for
repres
that
style
the
term
urban
in
refer
to
a
music
genr
in
uk
ha
develop
in
part
from
the
controversi
surround
the
brand
of
the
mobo
award
the
veri
term
music
of
black
origin
ha
confus
and
offend
mani
peopl
thi
is
particularli
strang
given
the
exist
of
the
asian
music
award
it
appear
that
the
use
of
black
or
white
in
relat
to
music
make
peopl
feel
uncomfort
the
term
urban
therefor
ha
been
invok
to
sidestep
the
debat
of
which
type
of
music
came
first
black
or
white
therebi
render
the
issu
colourblind
the
result
is
now
a
redund
new
debat
a
to
what
urban
also
mean
perhap
we
should
have
creat
a
new
term
altogeth
to
describ
the
variou
strain
of
soulrnb
and
hiphop
one
which
doe
not
also
mean
someth
els
a
we
have
done
with
crunk
urban
is
just
a
word
that
come
about
recent
to
describ
black
music
that
becom
popular
now
the
word
wasnt
even
in
use
or
common
use
five
of
six
year
ago
it
just
a
way
of
the
industri
clump
it
all
togeth
without
have
to
call
it
black
music
becaus
some
peopl
are
oversensit
and
might
call
them
racist
for
it
im
in
a
band
that
ha
been
call
urban
and
i
despis
the
label
id
hate
to
think
i
belong
to
ani
neat
market
nich
becaus
that
all
it
is
ever
sinc
the
music
channel
and
record
comapni
tri
to
fractur
what
they
consid
music
of
black
origin
these
label
have
been
use
to
undermin
the
statu
of
good
music
into
a
commod
look
at
all
the
tv
broadcast
unabl
to
reach
young
peopl
without
condesend
they
simpli
play
some
urban
music
on
the
soundtrack
a
if
it
some
dread
cheap
lift
music
ignor
the
label
it
is
what
it
is
just
music
a
a
black
man
i
think
i
agre
with
some
of
the
statement
at
least
the
statement
made
by
the
key
execut
black
peopl
should
lead
the
music
they
invent
we
should
stop
call
a
genr
meaningless
north
is
meaningless
the
real
question
is
would
joss
stone
would
have
been
that
success
do
the
music
she
wa
do
if
she
were
black
same
thing
with
street
ami
winehous
etc
who
ever
heard
of
terri
walker
or
rhian
benson
they
are
both
time
better
than
joss
stone
and
both
of
them
have
won
urban
music
award
and
i
think
mobo
but
whi
not
brit
so
what
if
joss
stone
won
the
urban
award
her
music
is
great
soul
and
sure
that
is
under
the
urban
banner
what
if
the
street
had
won
would
peopl
be
whine
becaus
mike
skinner
is
white
it
seem
that
a
lot
of
the
fuss
is
about
race
where
the
real
issu
should
be
music
and
noth
els
urban
is
pc
version
for
say
black
music
im
not
doubt
m
stone
talent
but
whi
didnt
jamelia
or
lemar
get
a
brit
thi
remind
me
of
what
happen
to
craig
david
and
soul
ii
soul
in
the
past
get
nomin
are
easi
to
get
but
pick
up
a
brit
seem
to
be
the
hardest
thing
refresh
to
see
peopl
make
reason
intellig
comment
on
ani
topic
these
day
more
power
to
you
peopl
you
have
said
it
there
is
music
you
like
and
music
you
dont
like
who
care
what
label
you
put
on
it
that
entir
categori
wa
a
mess
how
can
you
have
peopl
like
dizze
rascal
up
against
joss
stone
it
like
put
eminem
against
bob
geldof
she
should
have
been
nomin
for
best
british
r
b
act
joss
stone
deserv
to
win
an
award
for
her
talent
but
i
dont
think
it
wa
veri
urban
of
her
to
sing
angel
with
robbi
william
urban
is
a
nonsens
term
music
of
black
origin
well
doesnt
that
includ
rock
music
made
in
the
inner
citi
well
almost
all
band
end
up

etc
and
doesnt
that
make
some
weird
implic
that
all
black
peopl
live
in

it
doesnt
make
ani
sens
whi
doe
music
have
to
be
put
into
a
genr
it
music
you
like
it
or
you
dont
simpl
a
that
i
play
in
a
heavi
metal
band

are
urban
music
a
far
a
im
concern
we
live
in

and
spend
our
work
life
in
an
urban
environ
it
therefor
directli
shape
what
we
write
music
urban
seem
to
be
the
new
name
for
all
style
of
black
music
whi
it
need
a
rebrand
i
dont
know
a
the

mislead
oasi
origin
from
a
citi
and
characteris
the
urban
life
they
know
therefor
more
than
fit
the
term
urban
yet
a
theyr
a
white

they
wont
be
describ
a

what
other
reason
do
they
