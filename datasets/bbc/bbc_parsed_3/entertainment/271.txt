a
sever
problem
with
piraci
especi

piraci
and
we

have
a
sever
problem
of
privat
copi
i
dont
agre
that
the
music
industri
lost
control
over
the
music
market
in
fact
especi
in
regard
to
germani
talent
the
market
is
quit
success
he
did
howev
admit
that
copyright
owner
have
partli
lost
control
of
their
copyright
due
to
piraci
and
copi
but
he
refut
suggest
that
the
industri
had
been
too
slow
to
respond
to
digit
download
we
were
the
first
to
implement
a
download
servic
back
in
he
argu
at
that
time
it
wa
not
success
becaus
of
the
advent
of
piraci
it
wa
the
napster
time
when
pp

becam
popular
it
still
is
quit
difficult
for
the
music
industri
to
compet
with
a
price
that
is
zero
a
far
a
the
illeg
product
is
concern
mr
zombic
also
call
for
a
chang
to
the
percept
in
germani
that
privat
copi
of

is
not
a
problem
german
law
doe
allow
peopl
to
make
copi
of
cd
for
their
famili
and
close
friend
without
fear
of
break
copyright
mr

said
that
thi
legal
framework
wa
a
huge
problem
there
is
a
widespread
attitud
that
privat
copi
is
a
hobbi
it
