herald
a

the
magic
roundabout
is
out
in
the
uk
on
februari
how
about
bring
catweazl
to
the
big
screen
he
could
give
gandalf
a
run
for
hi
money
thundercat
i
love
it
should
be
fun
to
see
on
the
big
screen
if
some
effort
is
put
in
it
will
bring
my
youth
back
get
your
hand
off
the
clanger
is
noth
sacr
make
a
movi
version
of
the
banana
split
what
about
keanu
reef
and
richard
gere
in
a
remak
of
the
wooden
top
or
perhap
robbi
william
could
get
hi
much
moot
act
career
off
the
ground
by
take
on
the
role
of
andi
pandi
you
forgot
to
mention
the
grearest
of
them
all
danger
mous
but
then
again
it
couldnt
be
better
than
the
origin
seri
could
it
it
alway
nice
to
see
these
old
toon
rereleas
but
after
the
abysm
thunderbird
movi
and
the
song
i
think
ive
been
complet
put
off
just
leav
these
classic
alon
a
good
memori
i
think
remak
are
a
good
idea
a
the
world
move
on
peopl
tend
to
look
more
and
more
into
the
past
to
thing
that
make
them
feel
safe
i
believ
thi
is
the
whole
reason
retro
ha
becom
so
popular
a
long
a
a
remak
doe
justic
to
the
origin
then
all
it
can
do
is
creat
a
wider
audienc
and
possibl
entic
a
new
gener
of
person
to
enjoy
and
reviv
and
old
seri
person
id
like
to
see
cartoon
such
a
transform
thundercat
and
mask
get
full
hollywood
remak
leav
them
alon
whi
ruin
someth
that
we
all
have
veri
fond
memori
of
in
the
first
place
the
thunderbird
film
wa
apal
not
a
patch
on
the
puppet
seri
i
grew
up
with
and
the
magic
roundabout
will
never
be
the
same
without
the
voic
of
eric
thompson
love
to
see
transform
with
real
actor
and
cgi
and
make
it
at
least
a
rate
part
of
the
reason
for
the
success
of
such
classic
a
the
magic
roundabout
wa
that
the
charact
were
not
the
sweet
and
cuddli
creatur
that
you
would
expect
they
were
moodi
sarcast
and
rather
human
just
look
at
the
pictur
of
the
anim
for
the
new
film
show
that
these
characterist
have
not
been
preserv
dougal
never
smile
like
that
film
of
thi
sort
have
an
unfortun
habit
of
disneyfi
everth
and
they
just
lose
the
real
magic
that
made
the
show
special
in
the
first
place
i
have
fond
memori
of
bod
not
least
of
which
becaus
i
look
like
him
and
would
like
to
see
someon
attempt
to
make
it
into
a
film
it
got
all
the
right
materi
for
an
american
blockbust
no
plot
and
no
stori
bod
would
like
be
play
by
tom
cruis
and
would
undoubtedli
have
a
girlfriend
or
two
it
all
veri
well
and
good
remak
these
classic
tv
show
and
film
with
all
the
latest
technolog
for
a
new
audienc
but
for
me
a
lot
of
the
origin
charm
is
lost
when
they
do
thi
and
seem
more
like
a
money
make
exercis
to
cash
in
on
the
origin
success
of
the
programm
than
reinvent
or
improv
it
it
mayb
that
to
an
audienc
who
have
never
seen
the
origin
they
can
watch
them
without
prejudic
but
to
peopl
who
have
grown
up
with
all
these
show
such
a
thunderbird
and
magic
roundabout
which
are
part
of
our
childhood
they
are
never
go
to
live
up
to
expect
it
doe
pose
the
question
though
that
with
all
the
long
line
of
remak
be
made
are
filmmak
run
out
of
origin
idea
all
i
can
say
is
bring
back
danger
mous
probabl
the
greatest
kid
show
ever
i
recent
rewatch
some
episod
and
realis
that
there
wa
a
level
of
humour
shown
in
danger
mous
that
wa
complet
lost
on
me
when
i
wa
a
child
there
wa
a
new
captain
pugwash
cartoon
made
a
coupl
of
year
back
again
like
so
mani
of
these
nostalgia
programm
the
anim
thi
time
comput
creat
flatcel
like
anim
fail
to
match
the
origin
cut
out
paper
techniqu
for
invent
and
wa
woefulli
inadequ
we
live
in
a
sampl
world
the
music
industri
ha
been
pluder
past
decad
for
inspir
clip
sound
from
year
ago
is
much
cheaper
and
easier
that
do
someth
new
seem
that
the
film
and
tv
is
do
the
same
now
it
just
cheaper
to
take
idea
from
the
past
and
rework
them
rather
than
be
dare
and
tri
someth
new
it
got
to
be
mrbenn
the
stori
line
about
a
man
who
chang
in
a
fanci
dress
shop
step
into
a
door
way
and
appear
in
anoth
time
and
place
would
be
amaz
if
they
got
a
decent
produc
and
writer
the
stori
line
could
be
great
and
who
to
play
the
lead
role
well
if
it
wa
a
comedi
then
it
would
have
to
be
someon
like
steve
martin
if
it
go
to
be
an
adventur
then
johnni
depp
play
a
role
similar
to
the
pirat
of
the
caribbean
charact
muffin
the
mule
perhap
after
all
granni
and
grandpa
go
to
the
cinema
a
well
you
know
whi
cant
the
british
film
industri
tri
make
gerri
anderson
ufo
or
captain
scarlet
or
saphir
and
steel
or
the
tomorrow
peopl
in
today
medium
it
seem
the
past
is
the
futur
tv
show
such
a
battlestar
galactica
have
new
remak
dj
are
sampl
or
rework
s
and
s
music
even
comput
game
from
year
ago
are
get
modern
rework
person
i
think
it
show
that
no
one
ha
ani
origin
ani
more
whi
not
just
leav
our
mistyey
nostalgia
alon
mari
mungo
and
midg
but
of
cours
for
most
of
the
episod
the
lift
would
be
out
of
order
and
they
would
have
to
use
the
stair
plu
would
mari
be
more
of
a
vicki
pollard
charact
a
she
life
in
a
high
rise
council
block
yeah
but
no
but
i
wasnt
even
there
id
like
to
see
mr
benn
with
brad
pitt
in
the
titl
role
sean
conneri
could
play
the
mysteri
costum
shop
owner
it
demonstr
a
profound
lack
of
imagin
in
today
filmmak
that
they
continu
tri
to
remak
and
remodel
the
past
in
an
effort
to
cash
in
on
nostalgia
there
are
plani
of
modern
children
book
that
would
make
excel
film
or
tv
programm
whi
not
use
them
instead
of
rehash
the
past
mr
benn
with
rowan
atkinson
a
the
lead
would
have
love
to
see
dungeon
dragon
made
but
unfortun
the
film
that
it
wa
made
into
didnt
come
up
to
scratch
the
onli
one
that
isnt
to
be
remad
a
yet
is
thundercat
which
id
like
to
see
im
an
expat
live
in
norway
and
i
recent
went
through
a
period
of
buy
the
dvd
of
mani
of
my
favourit
children
program
for
my
daughter
my
dearest
wish
howev
is
to
see
a
featur
length
version
of
noggin
the
nog
appear
on
the
big
screen
veri
scandinavian
rainbow
i
believ
that
children
classic
should
be
left
well
alon
and
i
will
not
be
surpris
if
the
magic
roundabout
doe
not
do
well
at
the
box
offic
especi
sinc
it
will
be
go
up
against
the
spongebob
squarep
movi
popular
among
child
becaus
it
origin
witti
and
modern
the
magic
roundabout
will
never
appeal
to
the
child
of
today
a
it
did
all
those
mani
year
ago
how
about
classic
like
chorlton
and
the
wheeli
rentaghost
terrahawk
bodoh
the
list
could
go
on
and
on
if
a
transform
movi
is
inde
on
the
card
then
ill
be
the
first
one
on
amazon
buy
a
copi
eagerli
wait
at
the
front
door
with
a
frothi
mouth
and
a
nervou
twitch
repackag
my
childhood
and
sell
it
to
me
at
an
extortion
price
i
dont
care
till
then
ill
have
to
make
do
with
the
citreon
c
advert
id
luv
to
see
willow
the
wisp
on
the
big
screen
but
sadli
without
the
late
kenneth
william
do
the
voic
it
wouldnt
be
the
same
and
who
rememb
trap
door
voic
by
the
late
willi
rushden
superb
children
programm
could
morph
hold
hi
own
in
a
big
screen
movi
or
even
jami
and
the
magic
torchhmmmmm
i
could
go
on
and
on
danger
mous
at
im
show
my
age
noggin
the
nog
wa
one
of
the
best
children
program
the
problem
with
bring
it
to
the
big
screen
is
that
noon
could
approach
oliv
postgat
wonder
voic
so
in
gener
leav
well
alon
the
origin
are
good
becaus
they
are
of
their
time
and
the
method
use
are
an
integr
part
of
the
stori
just
imagin
what
could
be
achiev
by
use
cgi
in
a
remak
of
fingerbob
the
alreadi
disturb
hand
antic
of
the
beard
hippi
yoffi
could
take
on
a
whole
new
level
with
a
more
lifelik
fingermous
bob
the
builder
postman
pat
and
fireman
sam
togeth
in
an

in
the
ultim
struggl
to
save
the
woman
they
love
from
the
evil
clown
krusti
and
gobo
will
they
triumph
or
will
they
fail
miser
find
out
thi
fall
one
puppet
show
that
i
person
would
love
to
see
made
into
a
live
action
movi
is
joe
it
would
be
worth
the
price
of
admiss
alon
to
see
the
larg
screen
version
of
joe
car
of
cours
gerri
anderson
supermarion
is
a
rich
seam
of
materi
worthi
of
bigscreen
bigbudget
action
it
wa
onli
that
thunderbird
the
movi
wa
target
a
a
childrent
movi
that
realli
let
it
down
after
all
the
child
that
rememb
those
show
with
such
affect
are
now
the
parent
of
child
themselv
it
onli
becaus
the
peopl
who
were
child
when
these
programm
were
first
shown
have
grown
up
and
are
plunder
their
childhood
isnt
it
id
hate
to
see
bagpuss
with
perfect
anim
i
love
that
done
in
a
shed
clunki
and
you
couldnt
recreat
the
magic
perhap
if
the
remak
were
done
in
a
look
around
you
mockauthent
style
i
might
be
interest
chorton
and
the
wheeli
or
jami
and
hi
magic
torch
that
would
be
mega
thi
regurgit
of
old
film
and
tv
show
make
me
angri
it
is
corpor
lazi
rest
on
the
safeti
of
other
peopl
idea
becaus
it
guarante
to
bring
in
the
the
same
can
be
said
of
modern
day
pop
band
who
releas
other
peopl
materi
will
young
etc
the
sad
fact
is
nostalgia
sell
big
buck
in
the
shortterm
the
fact
that
they
will
be
forgotten
in
month
time
is
irrelev
eg
starski
hutch
henc
the
market
is
satur
with
thi
mindless
drivel
but
it
can
onli
be
stop
if
peopl
stop
buy
it
i
pray
they
never
do
a
remak
of
chorlton
and
the
wheeli
im
onli
and
dont
rememb
the
seri
from
when
it
wa
on
tv
but
have
the
set
on
dvd
and
it
a
classic
the
fact
it
so
great
come
from
the
fact
that
there
were
veri
few
special
effect
involv
and
compar
to
today
stuff
it
look
amateurish
that
the
appeal
though
it
so
innoc
like
chorlton
himself
and
it
would
be
a
real
shame
if
they
did
remak
it
