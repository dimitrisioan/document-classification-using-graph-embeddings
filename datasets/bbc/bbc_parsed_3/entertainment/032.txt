be
a
platform
for

but
the
commerci
success
of

is
becom
too
mainstream
smaller
festiv
like
slamdanc
and
xdanc
which
take
place
dure
the
same
week
in
park
citi
are
compet
for
sundanc
limelight
but
redford
is
not
worri
the
more
the
merrier
he
say
the
point
wa
to
creat
opportun
for
peopl
who
may
not
have
them
onc
independ
film
had
a
place
where
the
work
could
be
seen
suddenli
the
merchant
came
with
them
the
celebr
came
then
the
paparazzo
and
suddenli
it
began
to
take
on
a
whole
new
tone
explain
redford
peopl
start
to
say
we
had
gone
mainstream
and
hollywood
but
actual
hollywood
came
to
u
becaus
suddenli
there
wa
good
busi
in
independ
film
he
add
intern
filmmak
have
alway
been
celebr
here
but
is
the
first
year
a
dedic
world
dramat
and
documentari
competit
is
be
held
redford
want
the
festiv
to
encompass
viewpoint
he
believ
the
american
medium
fail
to
reflect
particularli
how
the
u
is
perceiv
intern
he
ha
never
hidden
the
fact
that
he
is
a
democrat
but
he
reserv
particular
disdain
for
the
current
republican
administr
it
the
abil
to
maintain
the
import
of
dissent
in
a
democrat
system
which
right
now
is
under
threat
with
the
attitud
of
thi
administr
he
say
i
think
mani
voic
are
be
shut
down
or
accus
of
be
unpatriot
if
they
want
to
express
anoth
point
of
view
that
veri
unhealthi
and
veri
danger
if
we
take
that
polici
into
the
world
there
will
be
the
same
victim
and
the
same
consequ
sundanc
isnt
just
one
big
screen
there
are
discus
panel
and
qa
session
with
director
tackl
controversi
topic
like
america
cultur
war
and
the
iraq
war
while
redford
wish
the
festiv
to
be
a
forum
for
dissent
the
profil
of
the
audienc
is
fairli
monolith
educ
middl
class
and
predominantli
white
american
come
sundanc
with
view
from
the
same
end
of
the
polit
spectrum
antiwar
and
social
liber
but
redford
know
thi
and
start
the
sundanc
tv
channel
in
an
effort
to
reach
a
wider
audienc
when
you
look
at
the
film
here
what
we
are
present
is
veri
much
egalitarian
and
it
about
good
film
and
good
storytel
be
it
african
america
asian
woman
gay
lesbian
sooner
or
later
we
will
do
away
with
those
stereotyp
