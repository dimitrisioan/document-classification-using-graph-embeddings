and
the
prison
of
azkaban
thi
third
harri
potter

brought
a
chang
of
director
and
a
dramat
visual
shakeup
that
realli
shine
on
dvd
gone
are
the
warm
bright
colour
found
in
the
two
earlier
film
alfonso
cuaron
bring
in
a
bleak
and
cold
feel
that
is
simpli
gorgeou
and
look
even
better
here
than
in
the
cinema
it
is
all
part
of
the
progress
of
harri
stori
into
darker
area
but
youll
spend
time
just
marvel
at
the
beauti
hogwart
landscap
thi
is
the
first
potter
film
where
you
get
so
lost
in
the
screen
adapt
that
you
forget
the
book
it
is
the
third
year
at
hogwart
and
studi
are
interrupt
a
they
alway
are
by
a
calam
that
onli
harri
ron
and
hermion
can
put
right
it
sound
corni
but
harri
is
no
longer
the
winsom
hero
he
is
a
moodi
teenag
and
daniel
radcliff
pull
it
off
veri
well
emma
watson
is
ever
better
a
hermion
and
the
young
star
are
join
by
the
usual
myriad
famou
actor
includ
gari
oldman
and
emma
thompson
the
film
itself
is
the
reason
to
buy
thi
dvd
but
it
is
laden
with
behindthescen
extra
includ
funni
if
shallow
interview
with
all
the
main
cast
but
what
seem
like
a
long
list
of
featur
can
be
swiftli
whittl
down
to
the
few
that
you
are
go
to
watch
younger
viewer
will
go
for
the
game
which
includ
a
magic
you
may
have
miss
memori
test
and
crookshank
chase
off
after
scabber
adult
viewer
will
ignor
those
and
go
straight
to
the
delet
scene
you
will
understand
whi
they
were
delet
but
it
is
fun
to
see
more
footag
and
not
have
to
hunt
through
endless
menu
to
find
it
a
we
did
on
the
first
harri
potter

most
interest
piec
are

the
vision
and
conjur
a
scene
a
short
featurett
about
the
make
of
the
