kaprano
describ
hi
appear
on
wednesday
a
more
daunt
by
a
long
way
than
their
upcom
brit
perform
i
dont
realli
care
about
the
brit
he
said
it
go
to
be
great
to
go
down
but
i
have
actual
had
to
exercis
part
of
my
brain
tonight
i
think
the
govern
should
do
more
to
help
upandcom
artist
be
discov
by
scrap
the
entertain
licenc
for
live
venu
also
they
should
do
more
to
help
independ
record
label
have
a
louder
voic
within
an
industri
domin
by
commercialis
major
label
rather
than
expect
the
govern
ie
the
taxpay
to
fork
out
whi
dont
some
of
the
megastar
put
someth
back
in
some
of
britain
wealthiest
peopl
are
musician
who
have
rake
it
in
from
album
concert
etc
there
are
far
more
import
demand
on
govern
fund
if
they
can
fund
footbal
whi
not
fund
music
area
of
the
art
are
fund
by
govern
and
lotteri
grant
so
whi
not
music
we
alreadi
have
the
opera
receiv
huge
grant
and
it
would
clearli
be
benefici
for
diver
in
music
to
have
the
same
opportun
in
other
area
of
the
music
the
onli
problem
would
be
how
to
judg
what
merit
state
cash
the
govern
ha
enough
problem
fund
school
and
health
servic
if
alex
kaprano
genuin
think
a
multibillion
pound
industri
should
also
have
govern
fund
then
hi
own
educ
wa
serious
lack
and
more
money
should
be
put
into
that
a
a
scot
live
in
england
i
appreci
the
valu
of
scottish
music
and
cultur
be
a
success
so
i
can
see
no
problem
with
it
franz
ferdinand
travi
and
snow
patrol
are
just
recent
exampl
of
the
success
scottish
music
can
have
in
the
world
so
we
should
do
what
we
scot
are
good
at
and
support
our
own
good
i
think
the
issu
is
more
fundament
should
the
govern
be
spend
money
on
subsidis
a
multimillion
pound
industri
when
health
and
educ
are
in
such
a
sorri
state
the
answer
is
most
definit
no
those
peopl
who
are
lucki
enough
to
pursu
their
passion
to
get
their
pay
chequ
shouldnt
be
look
for
govern
subsidi
i
know
that
if
i
wa
lucki
enough
to
be
abl
to
pursu
my
dream
of
show
jump
i
would
want
to
financ
myself
until
i
wa
in
a
posit
to
pursu
corpor
sponsorship
ye
the
govern
should
fund
music
it
bring
joy
to
the
mass
there
are
alreadi
thousand
of
statefund
musician
out
there
sit
around
twiddl
their
thumb
on
the
new
deal
get
the
govern
even
more
involv
would
onli
wast
money
that
could
be
put
to
better
use
a
long
a
the
govern
wa
fund
real
talent
it
would
be
a
great
move
i
would
hate
to
see
more
pop
idoltyp
fund
of
music
though
a
it
would
onli
serv
to
reinforc
the
stereotyp
that
alex
talk
about
onli
if
the
propos
make
financi
sen
franz
ferdinand
must
be
pay
seriou
amount
of
tax
on
their
record
sale
if
theyd
had
a
govern
grant
to
get
start
theyd
have
more
than
paid
it
back
by
now
so
the
treasuri
would
be
make
far
more
than
it
paid
out
howev
the
govern
ha
better
thing
to
spend
it
money
on
than
to
give
chariti
to
everyon
who
decid
theyr
a
musician
the
govern
shouldnt
fund
music
it
should
invest
in
music
and
those
invest
should
be
treat
like
ani
other
invest
i
think
the
govern
need
to
provid
facil
and
for
young
group
and
band
to
form
and
practis
the
equip
is
not
cheap
and
can
be
well
beyond
the
mean
of
mani
peopl
howev
i
do
feel
thi
should
be
the
extent
of
their
role
to
provid
the
condit
for
the
talent
to
flourish
and
let
it
go
from
there
i
do
agre
that
the
govern
should
help
to
fund
music
but
there
is
also
a
respons
held
by
record
compani
they
gener
alway
opt
for
the
tri
and
test
and
tend
not
to
want
to
break
ani
mould
or
risk
lose
ani
money
which
ultim
the
director
are
in
the
busi
for
if
label
were
more
will
to
put
money
forward
toward
smaller
breakthrough
act
then
the
govern
wouldnt
have
to
fork
out
a
great
deal
yeah
whi
not
music
should
be
govern
fund
particularli
the
work
of
modern
compos
and
veteran
bandsartist
and
stuff
pop
music
pretti
much
rule
the
earth
so
more
attent
should
go
to
the
other
fratern
i
agre
with
fund
the
art
to
make
it
more
access
to
the
public
but
i
am
not
convinc
that
pop
music
requir
financi
support
from
the
taxpay
there
is
a
great
deal
of
money
gener
through
pop
music
perhap
a
tax
on
pop
could
be
plough
into
the
public
perform
of
other
form
of
music
for
everyon
to
enjoy
perhap
we
could
financi
penalis
realli
bad
pop
idolstyl
music
that
is
the
music
industri
sector
without
ani
artist
merit
or
origin
whatsoev
and
that
which
is
specif
design
to
line
the
pocket
of
music
produc
call
it
a
tax
on
music
pollut
if
you
like
though
i
realli
like
franz
ferdinand
i
have
to
disagre
with
mr
kaprano
onc
govern
get
their
hand
into
the
privat
sector
it
will
destroy
the
creativ
and
possibl
controversi
avenu

year
ago
thi
wa
the
case
with

when
the
govern
start
to

what
wa
consid
art

they
were
