when

first
wire
fund
across

can
be
expens
thi
can
make
it
veri
cost
prohibit
to

smaller

of

and
often
mean
that

must
wait
longer
to

becaus
the

ha
to
save
up
until
the

is
larg
enough
to
warrant
the
cost
associ
with
the

servic
next
there
is
the
problem
of

both
the

must
be
abl
to
easili
reach
a

that
offer
the

even
if
they
both
are

the

even

fast

to

it
can
be
veri
expens
and

difficult
to

order
there
is
alway
the

way
to

by

the
most
conveni
fast
safe

effici
