progress
steve
thank
a
lot
i
think
that
have
the
pseudo
code
will
go
a
long
way
toward
understand
how
the
system
work
and
make
sure
that
there
are
no
bug
in
translat
of
a
busi
problem
for
exampl
complic
credit
insur
deal
with
multipl
trigger
and
condition
into
the
code
regard
tanya
s
attitud
just
a
few
point
i
don
t
think
she
ha
the
skill
to
do
the
system
administr
s
work
and
she
doe
not
have
the
necessari
privileg
thi
explain
whi
she
keep
ask
winston
for
help
it
s
not
that
the
work
is
beneath
her
some
member
of
tanya
s
team
came
to
me
complain
about
winston
he
effect
told
them
to
go
away
and
work
on
the
research
project
and
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
it
issu
i
don
t
think
that
it
s
just
tanya
s
issu
though
i
agre
that
a
more
outgo
person
would
be
help
the
realiti
of
thi
situat
is
that
the
intern
custom
beat
on
tanya
and
me
whenev
there
is
ani
perform
problem
and
or
they
intuit
disagre
with
the
result
of
a
run
they
could
not
care
le
about
the
demarc
line
between
it
and
research
they
also
want
tanya
to
sign
off
on
the
model
and
she
can
not
do
it
without
full
access
to
the
code
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
are
in
full
agreement
tanya
and
winston
have
to
work
a
a
team
and
i
shall
work
on
my
end
to
make
sure
that
it
happen
credit
is
emerg
a
a
critic
issu
for
enron

few
week
and
the
system

subject

vinc
i
got
feedback
from
the
lunchtim
research
meet
that
you
were
talk
about
some
specif
solut
to
perform
of
it
system
in
particular
distribut
process
also
i
heard
that
you
had
concern
about
the
use
of
multipl
languag
etc
both
of
these
sound
like
what
i
wa
discuss
with
you
on
previou
occas
do
you
feel
the
need
to
discu
these
further
the
multi
languag
issu
isn
t
realli
that
much
of
an
issu
a
the
current
system
is
java
right
now
although
i
am
a
big
fan
of
c
c
it
is
my
main
develop
skill
i
am
also
veri
awar
that
java
is
a
much
more
evolv
and
robust
languag
i
had
seriou
doubt
about
the
perform
but
i
ve
had
a
review
conduct
and
the
result
are
show
the
sun
unix
implement
to
be
nearli
a
fast
and
in
some
case
faster
than
c
c
becaus
of
someth
they
call
hot
spot
technolog
it
an
instruct
cach
techniqu
i
believ
the
concern
i
express
to
you
were
realli
about
how
technic
peopl
justifi
the
use
of
a
languag
on
the
strength
of
a
rel
meaningless
metric
like
portabl
on
the
issu
of
distribut
process
the
origin
review
i
had
conduct
by
our
architectur
group
point
to
that
a
a
solut
and
a
zhiyong
wei
is
alreadi
work
on
global
valuat
project
winston
is
activ
work
with
zhiyong
to
see
if
he
can
model
the
var
architectur
on
that
and
also
to
find
a
common
valuat
piec
between
the
system
i
d
like
the
opportun
to
talk
to
you
about
these
issu
if
you
have
some
time
over
the
next
few
day
also
i
sat
in
on
the
tanya
winston
meet
yesterday
and
a
per
our
discuss
at
the
elev
i
attempt
to
help
her
argument
by
suggest
to
all
present
that
she
wa
tri
to
perform
triag
on
the
code
i
e
seper
research
domain
problem
from
it
problem
she
said
that
step
through
code
wa
the
onli
real
way
in
which
she
could
get
a
feel
for
where
perform
bottleneck
were
i
ask
her
how
she
would
measur
that
and
she
said
she
would
instrument
the
code
manual
by
insert
time
element
at
strateg
point
i
mention
that
a
profil
tool
could
probabl
do
thi
job
for
her
tanya
again
said
that
step
through
code
is
the
onli
way
she
can
get
an
idea
of
the
code
and
that
studi
document
wasn
t
enough
about
week
ago
i
commiss
a
team
to
document
the
system
down
to
psuedo
code
level
and
will
be
abl
to
provid
thi
to
you
and
your
team
soon
in
fact
i
ve
ask
for
a
draft
copi
to
be
given
to
tanya
right
now
and
winston
is
also
work
on
a
draft
research
it
work
togeth
document
which
will
identifi
how
the
exchang
of
inform
take
place
tanya
also
gave
the
impress
that
she
want
a
dedic
it
develop
to
do
all
the
environ
setup
for
her
becaus
she
doesn
t
realli
want
to
have
to
do
that
i
think
that
thi
is
probabl
the
root
caus
of
the
issu
the
it
guy
are
work
veri
hard
and
her
handl
of
the
situat
is
not
good
a
it
give
the
impress
that
thi
kind
of
work
is
beneath
her
she
is
claim
that
they
are
un
cooper
they
are
claim
that
she
continu
ask
the
same
question
about
set
up
over
and
over
again
and
doesn
t
seem
to
want
to
learn
how
to
do
it
winston
on
the
other
hand
could
be
more
proactiv
in
determin
what
is
a
busi
relat
model
issu
and
an
it
issu
and
ask
for
help
from
research
i
think
you
debbi
and
i
need
to
work
quit
hard
to
get
them
to
play
nice
i
have
ask
tanya
and
winston
to
go
ahead
and
work
veri
close
togeth
over
the
next
few
day
and
debbi
brackett
and
i
will
review
their
progress
on
friday
