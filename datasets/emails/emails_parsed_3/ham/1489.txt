reiter
of
what
rick

had
said
in

i
would
simpli
ask
vinc

team
to
take
a
quick
look
tommorow
at

the
ship
a
stand

posit
with
a
guess
at
the
volatil
base
on
histor
price
movement
thi
would
be
much
easier
than
the
rainbow
option
approach
and
would
allow
u
to
roughli
look
at
the
valu
of
the
option
on
the
other
two
ship
in

word
we
could
look
at
two

with
some

also
estim

i
agre
with

the
most
rudimentari
measur
can
provid
the
best

tool
here
is
how
we
would
make

our

confirm
that

repres
a

and
that

he
also
confirm
that
the

is
the
result
of
the

have
reduc

suggest
that
the

last
for

measur
should
reduc
new

and
allow
for

but
not
by
an
extrem

versu
the
million
cost
of
thi

pierr
normal
like

howev
thi
is
difficult
in

illiquid

market
like

he
would
purchas
thi

if
the
lng

book
were
hi
to

he
estim
the

could
be
sold
in
a

sale
for
million
and
could
be
potenti
time
charter
on
a
long

basi
at
a
valu
of
up
to
million
our
develop
team
in
spain
itali
and
turkey
have
been
tri
to
solv
the
big
question
ga
in
each
countri
the
key
to
develop
a
merchant
plant
is
secur
ga
flexibl
or
at
least
secur
negoti
leverag
with
the
monopoli
ga
supplier
it
is
question
whether
or
not
thi
decis
will
have
an
immedi
impact
on
arco
the
plant
s
time
line
and
the
realiti
of
the
lng
suppli
market
may
requir
that
we
commit
to
ga
natur
befor
ani
sourc
of

ga
can
be
secur
the
shear
threat
of
be
abl
to
bring
spot
or
term
lng
to
these
market
will
improv
our
negoti
leverag
and
or
allow
u
to
creat
flexibl
go

howev
other
potenti
plant
opportun
in
spain
and
elsewher
in
the

may
have
the
capac

i
think
that
thi
