rich
sent

peopl
a
write
explain
hi
movi
trade
idea
and
ask
u
to

i
think
the

might
be
applic
to
other
part
of
enron
we
can
call
it
dynam
bid
ask
price
process
in
fact
we
can
set
that
the
bid
period
is
close
when
no
new
bid
is
submit
to
the
system
within
a
specifi
amount
of
time
the
final
clear
bid
and
ask
price
are
just
the
last
tent
price
shown
to
the
public
befor
the

period
end
so
the
custom
can
see
the
final
price
befor
the

close
and
can
revis
their

wish
i
think
thi

ask

i
think
we
should
let
the
price
float
with
the
market
instead
of
tri
to
forecast
it
otherwis
if
our
forecast
is
not
consist
with
the
market
we
may
have
an
imbal
in
the
bid
ask
order
and
we
may
end
up
take
some
posit
you
know
a
rus
and
martin
point
out
we
can
not
fight
with
the
studio
and
exhibitor
becaus
they
have
insid
inform
and
can
game
the
price
easili
one
way
to
ensur
the
balanc
of
the
bid
ask
order
is
to
emb
an
exchang
system
insid
our
bid
ask
price
front
end
each
week
we
have
a
trade
period
dure
the
period
instead
of
post
bid
ask

we
post
tent
bid
ask
price
then
we
ask
our
custom
to
submit
their
accept
buy

these

custom
can
revis
withdraw
their

we
calcul
and
post
the
final

the
seller
who

lower
sell
price
than
our

get
paid
at
the

price
the
buyer
who

higher
buy
price
than
our

price
pay
at
the

next
week
we
repeat
the

process
thi
way
we

trade
becaus
we

let

the
one
who
decid
the

if

some
more
input
hi
rich
and
key
again
i
think
your
idea
is
veri
good
i
think
that
we
a
a
market
maker
can
reduc
our
credit
risk
risk
of
default
if
we
do
the
mark
to
market
charg
that
is
each
week
when
we
releas
a
new
expect
valu
of
the
gross
box
offic
receipt
we
balanc
all
the
open
posit
the
same
way
a
in
a
regular
futur
market
thi
way
we
can
give
margin
call
to
the
couterparti
who
are
expect
to
owe
u
a
lot
of
money
in
the
last
paragraph
i
think
the
gross
box
offic
can
also
be
determin
from
the
market
itself
i
e
if
there
are
lot
of
buyer
our
offer
price
should
go
up
we
can
offer
other
deriv
product
such
a
