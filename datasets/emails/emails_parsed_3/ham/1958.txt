hi
everybodi
follow
up
on
our
discus
on
stress
correl
i
made
a
spreadsheet
and
a
dll
here
is
what
it
doe
in
the
input
main
sheet
the
user
ha
to
specifi
the
size
of
the
correl
matrix
the
row
and
column
for
the
element
he
want
to
stress
row
and
col
in
the
exampl
the
integ
number
n
iter
the
origin
correl
matrix
in
the
output
see
sheet
result
we
see
column
the
first
column
contain
possibl
correl
valu
from
to
n
iter
number
for
the
element
the
second
column
contain
the
smallest
eigenvalu
for
the
stress
correl
matrix
which
is
the
same
a
the
origin
matrix
except
the
element
and
which
take
valu
from
to
thu
the
user
can
see
which
valu
for
the
chosen
element
are
permit
those
for
which
the
smallest
eigenvalu
is
posit
mark
green
in
the
exampl
the
user
might
decid
that
he
want
to
assign
the
correl
which
is
not
permit
to
thi
particular
element
the
smallest
eigenvalu
is
neg
then
the
user
might
have
a
few
option
all
the
element
of
the
correl
matrix
will
be
modifi
so
that
the
chosen
element
ha
the
desir
correl
in
it
but
the
chang
in
the
correl
matrix
is
the
smallest
possibl
in
the
sen
of
matrix
norm
thi
is
my
next
step
to
do
for
thi
spreadsheet
just
one
column
and
the
correspond
row
of
cours
will
chang
while
the
rest
of
the
matrix
will
stay
unchang
kevin
s
suggest
in
thi
case
the
user
have
to
choos
which
column
and
row
he
prefer
to
modifi
in
my
exampl
column
row
or
column
row
we
can
discus
thi
approach
with
risk
control
and
see
how
they
like
it
i
send
you
onli
the
spreadsheet
with
an
exampl
now
