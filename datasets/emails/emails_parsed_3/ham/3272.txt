feedback
i
ask
jacob
two
question
to
check
hi
basic
knowledg
he
answer
correctli
in
the
optim
question
so
i
believ
that
he
ha
a
good
foundat
on
hi
optim
skill
i
have
a
doubt
about
hi
stochast
skill
becaus
he
took
onli
one
cours
in
stochast
process
and
hi
previou
model
are
simpl
determinist
model
if
we
had
more
interview
time
i
would
be
abl
to
check
hi
stochast
and
model
skill
he
complet
fail
to
answer
the
second
question
which
is
to
check
hi
basic
risk
manag
skill
it
is
clear
to
me
that
he
ha
a
veri
weak
background
in
financ
and
risk
manag
he
doe
not
understand
the
relationship
between
a
discount
rate
and
risk
he
show
some
weak
in
annuiti
calcul
in
conclus
i
feel
that
he
ha
good
basic
in
optim
but
a
veri
weak
background
in
financ
base
on
hi
experi
i
have
a
doubt
on
hi
advanc
optim
skill
such
a
hi
stochast
skill
and
hi
abil
to
attack
a
complex
optim
problem
i
would
recommend
a
second
round
interview
if
he
will
be
solv
a
complex
optim
problem
