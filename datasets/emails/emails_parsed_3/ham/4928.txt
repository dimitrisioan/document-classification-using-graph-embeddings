we

current
there
exist
one
smile
for
everi
region
which
is
specifi
in
term
of
volatil
addit
for
specifi
dollar
differ
from
the
underli
sinc
differ
month
in
a
region
can
trade
in
a
larg
rang
thi
can
not
result
in
accur
skew
for
all
term
what
we
need
is
a
system
which
ha
skew
per
month
we
suggest
for
the
short
term
the
skew
should
appli
onli
to
the
summer
daili
expir
option
we
need
to
make
thi
chang
by
earli
next
week
howev
we
need
to
start
modif
the
system
so
that
for
everi
region
we
can
enter
a
grid
which
ha
a
percentag
scale
and
specifi
the
skew
differ
for
each
month
research
ha
implement
thi
in
our
price
model
and
we
would
like
thi
grid
to
be
input
into
the
valuat
system
i
am
enclos
the
price
model
which
we
both
discuss
yesterday
for
refer
thi
model
is
howev
work
under
construct
so
pl
call
alex
huang
for
clarif
the
vol
input
system
is
complex
and
confus
i
would
veri
much
be
interest
in
move
to
a
direct
databas
interfac
which
accomod
the
skew
input
per
region
a
in
we
should
implement
a
ui
which
can
input
the
daili
and
monthli
at
the
money
and
the
skew
grid
directli
so
that
we
do
not
need
to
go
through
multipl
iter
i
am
veri
much
interest
in
what
we
current
are
releas
in
delphi
and
would
love
an
earli
implement
for
option
on
all
these
issu
i
am
speak
for
the
east
desk
i
am
go
to
touch
base
with
west
guy
and
see
if
