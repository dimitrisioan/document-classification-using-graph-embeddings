combinatori
auction
stinson
and
greg
i
have
read
the
paper
combinatori
auction
with
multipl
winner
for
univers
servic
from
richard
steinberg
and
frank
kelli
they
propos
a
combinatori
auction
which
is
an
auction
for
multipl
item
that
allow
bidder
to
realiz
their
synergi
on
combin
of
item
the
combinatori
auction
is
appropri
for
bandwidth
commod
becaus
most
bidder
in
the
market
have
synergi
on
the
combin
of
item
for
exampl
if
we
want
to
get
bandwidth
between
boston
and
dc
we
would
bid
for
boston
ny
and
ny
dc
it
will
be
valuabl
to
u
onli
if
we
won
both
link
if
we
won
onli
one
link
it
will
be
useless
in
the
paper
they
propos
the
auction
method
but
their
method
ha
not
been
test
or
valid
yet
i
have
not
check
their
proposit
mathemat
but
their
paper
wa
publish
in
manag
scienc
so
i
think
it
should
be
all
right
i
will
look
at
it
in
more
detail
and
let
you
know
anyhow
there
are
also
other
combinatori
auction
that
are
actual
use
for
exampl
the
alberta
govern
s
ppa
auction
that
enron
canada
wa
particip
month
ago
base
on
our
long
posit
on
bandwidth
auction
and
exchang
might
be
a
good
channel
to
dispos
our
unus
or
unsold
bandwidth
i
know
there
is
not
much
demand
in
the
market
but
if
we
open
a
combinatori
auction
or
exchang
we
might
be
abl
to
increas
our
market
share
by
take
demand
from
our
competitor
i
believ
at
the
moment
there
are
no
bandwidth
exchang
that
allow
combinatori
bid
if
we
are
the
first
one
to
do
it
we
might
improv
our
sale
channel
and
gain
some
market
share
note
auction
one
seller
and
mani
buyer
exchang
mani
seller
and
mani
buyer
moreov
i
think
auction
the
unsold
bandwidth
will
not
hurt
u
becaus
we
can
not
sell
them
anyway
in
addit
we
ourselv
can
be
a
dummi
bidder
in
the
system
and
bid
in
the
auction
if
the
current
wine
bid
is
too
low
we
can
just
over
bid
it
and
keep
the
product
thi
way
we
can
indirectli
put
a
reserv
price
on
the
product
let
s
meet
sometim
in
the
first
week
of
januari
chonawe
