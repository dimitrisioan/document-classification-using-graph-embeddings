i
wa
think
about
the
type
of
thing
you
could
be
talk
to
jeff
shankman
about
in
the
dabhol
lng
context
it
occur
to
me
that
one
way
to
collect
on
rega
charg
and
still
find
altern
cutom
for
ga
is
through
the
railway
some
time
back
i
had
look
into
the
possiblil
of
transport
lng
by
train
appar
technolog
exist
wherein
lng
can
be
put
into
cryogen
contain
that
can
be
truck
a
well
a
the
same
contain
be
load
from
truck
to
train
bogi
i
believ
thi
mayb
a
way
to
earn
some
moni
with
lng
by
develop
just
such
a
market
in
india
for
commerci
custom
it
is
pertin
to
note
that
the
konkan
rail
line
is
just
about
hr
minut
from
the
dabhol
plant
truck
from
dabhol
could
carri
lng
to
the
rail
line
at
guhagar
from
where
it
could
travel
up
and
down
the
west
coast
of
india
if
we
target
end
consum
directli
we
could
easili
sell
at
retail
type
price
and
build
in
a
larg
margin
even
if
the
volum
dispos
are
rel
smaller
the
altern
fuel
for
most
of
these
establish
is
diesel
or
naphtha
which
is
highli
price
and
mostli
truck
along

increas
cost
the
end
aim
is
to
keep

so
that
the
