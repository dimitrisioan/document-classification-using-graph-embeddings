subject
ee
oper
risk
per
our
convers
here
is
the
model
that
i
have
for
simon
the
note
that
i
gave
you
were
from
some
work
i
did
back
in
septemb
a
i
wa
look
for
volum
number
the
note
show
what
drive
the
final
cash
flow
number
briefli
the
issu
surround
exactli
what
is
meant
by
nonmarket
and
noncredit
risk
ideal
thi
would
be
anyth
that
effect
npv
of
the
deal
howev
i
think
that
we
should
limit
ourselv
to
those
thing
that
effect
the
time
and
amount
of
the
eam
volum
even
here
such
a
problem
set
is
quit
larg
if
you
glanc
at
the
spreadsheet
model
you
will
notic
that
there
exist
a
larg
number
of
possibl
item
that
effect
the
eam
volum
if
we
are
to
do
thi
rigor
then
it
is
necessari
to
tear
apart
ee
s
busi
model
and
although
such
an
attempt
to
do
so
would
be
nobl
the
scope
of
such
an
excercis
may
be
too
larg
we
need
a
clear
definit
of
ee
oper
risk
briefli
from
the
ee
deal
that
i
have
look
at
two
thing
drive
their
profit
a
long
term
bet
that
power
price
will
go
down
and
that
we
can
improv
the
facil
through
variou
enhanc
each
of
these
may
be
glean
from
the
spreadsheet
a
well
a
the
assumpt
regard
the
fund
of
the
facil
improv
and
so
on
of
the
save
is
assum
to
come
from
power
and
from
ga
the
effeci
gain
may
not
be
explicitli
given
if
we
have
data
that
show
the
realiz
effici
gain
then
it
would
be
simpl
in
principl
to
determin
a
distribut
and
henc
a
distribut
of
eam
volum
npv
s
etc
at
thi
time
i
understand
that
rac
ha
determin
some
of
the
realiz
effici
gain
but
my
knowledg
is
quit
sketchi
jay
hachen
may
have
more
info
if
i
get
a
chanc
i
will
tri
to
see
if
i
can
do
a
proof
of
concept
excercis
but
i
have
a
late
januari
deadlin
on
someth
els
anoth
point
even
if
we
are
success
in
do
thi
for
the
spreadsheet
model
ee
ha
chosen
to
book
thing
differ
i
do
not
have
a
thorough
understand
of
their
it
system
but
at
least
in
principl
if
we
can
do
thi
for
the
spreadsheet
model
then
we
can
do
it
in
their
it
environ
data
are
data
are
data
they
may
book
effici
gain
through
improv
type
such
a
gain
due
to
compressor
chiller
boiler
etc
if
thi
is
inde
the
case
then
we
need
to
have
distribut
for
each
type
of
improv
if
we
are
success
on
the
spreadsheet
and
not
success
with
their
it
system
then
the
other
altern
is
to
build
our
own
report
system
it
would
be
similar
to
a
databas
where
the
recordset
are
replac
by
excel
workbook
it
can
be
construct
in
such
a
way
a
to
enabl
u
to
run
simul
and
queri
but
thi
would
probabl
take
me
about
five
or
six
week
final
don
hawkin
doe
oper
audit
for
enron
s
physic
asset
he
send
out
team
to
audit
our
pipelin
and
strateg
asset
i
don
t
think
that
he
doe
it
for
ee
but
you
might
want
to
give
him
a
call
anyway
