here
s
the
stori
research
forward
to
their
personnel
a
solicit
they
receiv
for
java
train
by
an
outsid
person
weeklong
class
for
true
beginn
and
for
those
with
decent
program
experi
in
other
languag
esp
c
vinc
had
pre
agre
tlo
pay
for
it
for
anyon
who
want
it
but
the
respons
they
got
wa
so
overwhelm
they
reconsid
for
financi
reason
and
decid
it
would
be
better
to
just
hire
a
professor
to
teach
a
class
for
a
week
here
the
cost
would
be
around
and
there
should
be
room
for
around
peopl
in
the
class
they
have
peopl
and
wonder
if
we
might
have
some
peopl
who
would
want
to
do
it
a
no
brainer
java
is
a
big
time
resum
pad
these
day
and
would
be
will
to
share
the
cost
with
them
what
is
your
opinion
on
thi
person
i
think
it
s
a
rel
inexpens
invest
in

selfishli
it
