i
met
with
bob
today
and
discuss
the
deal
structur
we
put
togeth
on
the
mark
to
market
issu
bob
and
hi
colleagu
wess
told
me
that
a
long
a
payment
are
tie
to
one
particular
plant
we
can
not
m
t
m
them
they
had
same
problem
with
plant
here
in
the
u
like
the
peak
plant
and
they
had
to
separ
the
plant
from
power
sale
to
be
abl
to
m
t
m
the
assoc
cashflow
what
they
did
is
they
sold
power
from
the
plant
to
an
outsid
parti
and
bought
it
back
from
them
at
complet
differ
multipl
locat
the
buyback
is
not
tie
to
ani
specif
plant
and
is
mark
to
maket
even
if
enron
can
somehow
mark
to
market
a
deal
with
dpc
it
can
do
so
for
onli
of
the
cashflow
becaus
onli
of
dpc
is
own
by
outsid
and
a
simpl
loan
to
an
affili
can
not
also
be
mark
to
market
bob
wa
suggest
that
if
eipl
buy
option
from
dpc
and
from
some
other
plant
and
in
turn
sell
power
to
ap
or
karnataka
then
we
could
have
a
case
for
m
t
m
polit
dpc
sell
power
to
eipl
may
not
be
the
best
solut
to
put
it
rather
mildli
our
altern
a
i
see
them
are
do
the
deal
a
we
structur
it
the
onli
differ
is
that
enron
doesn
t
mark
it
to
market
and
incom
is
earn
onli
in
do
the
deal
a
we
structur
it
eipl
enron
then
sell
the
contract
to
anoth
parti
at
a
profit
the
problem
of
cours
is
find
thi
parti
and
fork
part
of
the
profit
to
them
same
deal
except
revenu
securit
is
done
through
an
outsid
parti
in

treat
and
whether
there
is
a
way
to
get
credit
for
the
tax
payabl
in

u
i
am
