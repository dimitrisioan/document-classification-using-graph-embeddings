i
want
to
send
a
short
note
to
express
my
thank
to
enron
and
give
some
addit
thought
about
the
enron
present
both
student
and
staff
enjoy
our
interact
with
enron
we
hope
enron
got
a
much
from
the
project
a
we
did
i
also
had
some
addit
thought
about
enrononlin
dure
the
present
the
student
refer
to
a
market
s
critic
mass
howev
we
never
defin
what
we
meant
by
that
we
had
sever
discus
on
thi
topic
i
think
the
best
way
for
enron
to
think
about
thi
is
in
term
of
the
psycholog
of
trader
critic
mass
give
a
market
liquid
trader
seem
to
think
about
liquid
in
term
of
breadth
how
mani
product
are
be
trade
and
depth
the
number
of
bid
and
offer
our
thought
were
that
when
a
trader
pull
up
a
screen
he
or
she
want
to
see
bid
offer
and
trade
occur
so
a
simpl
and
cheap
metric
that
enron
could
use
to
determin
whether
rival
are
approach
critic
mass
is
simpli
to
pull
up
screen
and
see
if
trade
are
occur
and
how
quickli
trader
will
gener
not
use
a
trade
platform
that
lack
action
in
term
of
new
power
i
feel
it
is
extrem
import
that
your
manag
creat
an
ident
for
the
compani
luckili
no
rival
ha
done
thi
though
green
energi
is
closer
than
most
the
compani
that
can
commun
a
simpl
and
power
messag
will
creat
a
competit
advantag
for
itself
i
believ
you
can
differenti
yourself
in
thi
market
though
you
are
sell
a
commod
sinc
you
are

differenti
is
alway
possibl
on
a
final
note
